### 特朗普第二任期：权力扩张与民主挑战

**Michael Bubaro**: 欢迎回来。本期《The Daily》是系列节目中的第一集，旨在评估过去一年。我们首先请来了我的三位同事：**Maggie Haberman**、**Jonathan Swan**和**Charlie Savage**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Welcome back. Today, in the first of a series of episodes evaluating the past year, we begin by turning to three of my colleagues, **Maggie Haberman**, **Jonathan Swan**, and **Charlie Savage**.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 各位，欢迎回来。我们请三位来，是因为总统任期已满一年。这总是一个反思的时刻，对于**唐纳德·特朗普**第二任期极其多事的第一年来说，更是如此。你们三位都报道了特朗普的第一任期，然后共同报道了一个系列，关于我们应该如何预期他的第二任期，其中大部分都已成为现实。碰巧的是，你们三位现在都在撰写关于特朗普及其总统任期的书籍。所以，你们正在进行深入思考，或者至少我们希望如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Maggie, Jonathan, Charlie, welcome back. We come to the three of you on the occasion of this presidential term reaching its one-year mark. Always a moment for reflection, perhaps never more so than the extremely eventful first year of **Donald Trump's** second term. And all three of you covered Trump's first term and then you co-reported a series about what we should all expect from his second term, much of which came to pass. And as it happens, all three of you are now working on books about Trump and his presidency. So, you're thinking big thoughts, or at least we're hoping that you're thinking big thoughts.

</details>

**Jonathan Swan**: 谢谢你的鼓励。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan Swan**: Thank you for the encouragement.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 我们认为，你们的独特视角使你们非常适合进行这次对话。希望你们也同意。我们想从询问你们对**唐纳德·特朗普**第二任期第一年的整体框架思考开始。**Jonathan**，我先从你这里开始。我对特朗普的观念性起点，基本上就是我们2023年系列报道的起点，即我们根据报道和与特朗普身边所有人的交流，提出的第一个重要观点是，**唐纳德·特朗普**的第二任期将涉及**行政权力**的过度使用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: You're uniquely positioned, we think, to have this conversation. Hope you agree. So, we wanted to start by asking you for the right big framework for thinking about this first year of **Donald Trump's** second term. And **Jonathan**, let me start with you there. Where I start conceptually with Trump is basically where we started with our series in 2023, which is the first big idea that we put out there based on our reporting, based on talking to all the people around Trump was that a second term of **Donald Trump** would involve extravagant uses of **executive power**.

</details>

**Jonathan Swan**: 在某些情况下，可能是前所未有的**行政权力**使用。很早我们就清楚地看到，这正是正在发生的事情。同时发生了太多激进的行动。这体现在他的移民政策、关税使用、他攻击公民社会的方式以及他打压大学的方式。行政部门内部有一些机构，根据法律或惯例，被认为是独立于总统本人的行政权力之外的。他完全抛弃了这一点。现在的情况是，他直接指示**司法部长**起诉某些个人，这是我们国家以前从未见过的。他还对**联邦通信委员会**施压，要求其针对某些媒体公司。这些机构，无论是根据法规还是惯例，原本都是独立的，现在不再独立了。我们现在都忘了**Doge**，但这曾是行政权力的一种非凡体现。所以，这已经是深刻变革的总统任期中的一年了。当我思考这个问题时，它都回到了这种权力观念：权力属于**唐纳德·特朗普**，任何对他的权力制约都是不合法的，都应该被推平。**Maggie**，你对这第一年使用的框架是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan Swan**: In some cases, possibly unprecedented use of **executive power**. And it became very clear early on that that's exactly what was coming to bear. There were just so many aggressive actions happening at once. It was happening in his immigration actions, in his use of tariffs. We saw it in the way that he attacked civil society, the way that he squeezed universities. We have agencies within the executive branch that either by law or by custom are understood to be independent from executive authority from the president himself. He completely jettisoned that. You have a situation where he is directing the **attorney general** to prosecute named individuals, something that we haven't seen in this country before. You also had him jawboning the **FCC** to go after certain media companies. Again, agencies that are either by statute or by norm independent no longer are independent. We've all forgotten **Doge** now, but that was an extraordinary expression of executive authority. So, it's already a year in a profoundly transformational presidency. And when I think about it, it all comes back to this conception of power that power belongs to **Donald Trump** and that any checks upon his power are illegitimate and ought to be bulldozed. **Maggie**, what's the framework you have been using for this first year?

</details>

### 权力的个人化与复仇

**Maggie Haberman**: 我完全同意**Jonathan**所说的一切，我只想补充几点。首先，存在这种**权力个人化**的现象，他不仅通过**司法部**起诉他认为的敌人，他还威胁或实际发布行政命令，针对他认为受到侵害的律师事务所，或者他的一些律师认为受到侵害的律师事务所。他显然处于一种“他应得的”阶段，他认为自己受到了伤害，并且应该为此得到某种补偿，字面意义上的补偿，他希望**司法部**，他公开说过，为针对他的一些调查给他一笔和解金。他管理着这个**司法部**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Maggie Haberman**: Oh, I agree with everything **Jonathan** said and I just will add a few things. One is there is this sort of **personalization of power** where not only targeting his enemies, perceived enemies I should say, for prosecution through the **DOJ**, but targeting law firms that he felt aggrieved by or some of his own lawyers felt aggrieved by with threats of executive orders or actual executive orders. He is clearly in sort of a he is owed his due phase where he believes he was harmed and he believes that he should have some kind of compensation for that literally in the sense that he wants the **DOJ** and he openly said this to give him a settlement for some of the investigations into him. He runs this **justice department**.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 对吧？他希望他监管的**美国司法部**能为他以前的法律纠纷提供实际的经济补偿。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Right? He wants the **United States Department of Justice**, which he oversees, to literally financially compensate him for a previous legal grievance he has.

</details>

**Maggie Haberman**: 而且金额不小，我们应该说。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Maggie Haberman**: And and not a small amount, we should say.

</details>

**Jonathan Swan**: 不。我的意思是，索赔金额，我想是**2.3亿美元**。通常和解金不会那么多，但无论多少，都会超过零。回顾今年早些时候，**Jonathan**和**Eric Lipton**一起报道了一个故事，关于**特朗普**对新**空军一号**迟迟未到的不满，这些飞机是他第一任期内委托制造的，由于各种问题而延误。所以，政府（我应该说）被赠予了一架曾属于**卡塔尔王室**的豪华喷气式飞机。他的政府找到了这种创造性的方式，将其赠予**国防部**，然后它将直接赠予他的**总统图书馆**，他说他之后不打算驾驶它，他的一些顾问私下表示他们很难相信这一点。所以，你可以看到他认为自己“应得的”各种方式。这就是我观察很多事情的框架。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan Swan**: No. Well, I mean, the claim was, I think it was **$230 million**. Usually settlements are not that much, but whatever it is, it will be more than zero. You know, you go back all the way to earlier in the year, a story that **Jonathan** and I did with **Eric Lipton** about **Trump's** frustration about not having the new **Air Force One**s that he had commissioned, the planes in term one that are delayed because of all kinds of issues. So instead, he's being the government, I should say, is being gifted a luxury jet that was owned by the once owned by the **Qatari royal family**. His government found this creative way to have it given to the **defense department** and then it's just going to be gifted to his **presidential library** and he says that he doesn't plan to fly it afterwards and some of his own advisers privately say they find that hard to believe. So, you can run the gamut on this of ways in which he sees himself as owed a due. That is the frame through which I am seeing a lot of this.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 权力的个人化。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: The personalization of power. Yeah.

</details>

**Jonathan Swan**: 我认为另一个非常重要的因素，如果你把它放在“**唐纳德·特朗普**的赔偿”这个大框架下思考，那就是在第二个任期，他非常关注**遗产**和为自己建造**纪念碑**，但资金却来自**美国企业界**。他们为什么要花这么多钱？他正在建造一个大型宴会厅，它将被视为**白宫**的“**唐纳德·特朗普**宴会厅”。为什么企业要捐赠**500万**、**1000万**？他们是出于恐惧。显然。我的意思是，我们采访了许多代表不同公司并在高级职位工作的人。对他们来说，这只是小钱，因为他们知道这位总统完全愿意利用联邦政府来伤害他们或帮助他们。你在这里诊断出的，我认为，与你所说的**Maggie**结合起来，非常引人入胜。总统正在**个人化权力**，这变得**自我强化**。他个人化了复仇。没错。那这会带来什么？它最终会鼓励那些复仇的目标或避免成为目标的人，去资助总统权力个人化中**自我不朽**的一面。这对他来说形成了一个良性循环。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan Swan**: I think another element of this that's really important if you sort of think about it under the, you know, **reparations for Donald Trump** umbrella is in this second term, he's thinking a lot about **legacy** and building **monuments** to himself, but the money is being extracted from **corporate America**. Why are they spending all this money? Well, he's building this big ballroom which will be seen as **Donald Trump's ballroom** at the **White House**. Why are corporations donating **5 million**, **10 million**? They're doing it out of fear. Obviously. I mean, we talked to a lot of people who represent and work at a senior level at different corporations. This is small change for them knowing that this is a president who's perfectly willing to use the federal government to hurt them, help them. And what you're diagnosing here, I think, is kind of fascinating to bring it together with what you said, **Maggie**. The president is **personalizing power**, and that becomes **self-reinforcing**. He personalized revenge. Correct. And what does that do? It ends up encouraging the targets or the avoiding targets of that revenge to then fund the **self-immortalization** side of the personalization of the presidency. And it becomes a virtuous cycle for him.

</details>

**Maggie Haberman**: 完全正确。他还，你知道，把**肯尼迪中心**改名为**特朗普肯尼迪中心**，把**和平研究所**改名为**唐纳德·J·特朗普和平研究所**。在很多方面，这些都是他可以利用总统权力做的事情。没有法律障碍，所以他就会去做。他想把**达拉斯/沃斯堡机场**改名为**特朗普机场**。他想要一个**北极凯旋**的版本，他们内部称之为“**北极特朗普**”的建筑。所以，这是其中很大一部分。这是在**华盛顿特区**留下他的印记，他的实体印记。你们上次都把我搞砸了。你知道，你们窃取了选举，你们试图把我送进监狱，但我回来了。你猜怎么着？你们现在必须面对我，我就是要让你们难堪。关于**唐纳德·特朗普**的一点是，他知道如何积极地运用权力。没错。这就是第一年的故事：**唐纳德·特朗普**积极地主张权力，并且大体上取得了成功。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Maggie Haberman**: Exactly. You also had him, you know, renaming the **Kennedy Center**, the **Trump Kennedy Center**, making the **Institute of Peace**, the **Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace**. In many ways, it's these are things that I can do with the presidency. There's no legal impediment, so I'm going to do them. He wants to rename **Dallas/Fort Worth airport** the **Trump airport**. He wants a version of the **Arctic triumph**, which they call internally the **Arctic Trump** built. So, that's a big part of this. It's putting his imprint, his physical imprint, on **Washington DC**. And you guys all screwed me last time. You know, you stole the election, you tried to put me in jail, and I'm back. And guess what? You have to reckon with me now, and I'm just going to rub this in your faces. And one thing about **Donald Trump** is he knows how to use power aggressively. Correct. And that's the story of this first year is **Donald Trump** aggressively asserting power and largely succeeding.

</details>

### 权力制衡的失效

**Michael Bubaro**: **Charlie**，你对这个问题的思考框架是什么？我们正在讨论权力及其巩固。我们正在讨论这种权力的个人化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: And **Charlie**, what is your framework for thinking about this? We're talking about power and its consolidation. We're talking about the personalization of that power.

</details>

**Charlie Savage**: 对吧？所以，**Jonathan**和**Maggie**一直在谈论的一个贯穿主题是，**特朗普**一直在行使权力，直到有人阻止他。而现在由共和党控制的**国会**完全受他摆布。显然，国会不会阻止他。今年晚些时候将举行选举。我们将看看是否至少有一个议院会易主。那时可能会开始出现重要的、有意义的监督调查。尽管我们在特朗普的第一任期也看到了这一点，但这些调查的结果是传票被阻挠等等。所以，如果国会目前显然什么都不会做，那么问题就来了，即使在民主党控制下，它是否能有效地做些什么，这最终就只剩下**法院**了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Charlie Savage**: Right? So, a running theme in what **Jonathan** **Maggie** you've been talking about is **Trump** exercising power until somebody stops him. And **Congress** right now controlled by a Republican party that is completely in his thrall. Clearly, he's not going to stop him. There will be an election later this year. We'll see if at least one chamber flips. Then there could start to be significant, you know, meaningful oversight investigations. Although we saw that in the first Trump term and the answer to those investigations were stonewalling of subpoenas and such. And so if **Congress** currently it clearly is going to do nothing and the question arises whether even under Democratic control it can effectively do something that leaves you with the **courts**.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 对吧？最大的问题是，这个**司法机构**将在多大程度上批准，或者至少不阻碍他以这些非凡的、多种多样的方式行使权力，这些权力以前并未被明确理解为属于**白宫**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Right? And the big question being to what extent is this **judiciary** going to ratify or at least not stand in the way of these extraordinary myriad ways in which he's assuming and exercising powers that were not previously clearly understood to reside in the **White House**.

</details>

**Charlie Savage**: 现在谈论这个有点困难，因为很多关于这些事情的诉讼都悬而未决。很多人认为，法院可能会推翻他单方面征收进口税或关税的做法，这可能是一个整体模式中的一个大例外。但从目前的角度来看，在很大程度上，虽然他最初经常受到下级法院法官的阻挠，但当事情到达**最高法院**时，它大体上允许他做他想做的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Charlie Savage**: It's a little hard to talk about this right now because a lot of the litigation over this stuff is unresolved. A lot of people think it is possible that the court may strike down his unilateral imposition of import taxes or tariffs and that may be a big exception to an overall pattern. But from the vantage point right now, for the most part, while he has been stymied initially by lower court judges a lot, when stuff has reached the **Supreme Court**, it has by and large allowed him to do what he wants to do.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 对。总结你的意思，法院，特别是**最高法院**，已经并将似乎准备继续批准、编纂，无论你怎么称呼它，这种扩大了的总统权力，这比可能任何现代总统的权力都要大得多。我的意思是，我能问一下这个问题吗，**Jonathan**？你能想到总统行使这种程度权力的先例吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Right. And just to distill what you're saying, the courts, especially the high court, the **Supreme Court**, has and appears poised to continue to ratify, codify, whatever you want to call it, this expanded power of this presidency, which is much greater than probably any modern presidency. I mean, can I just ask that question, **Jonathan**? Is there a precedent that you can think of for the exercise of this level of power by the president?

</details>

**Jonathan Swan**: 嗯，我们有很多总统的先例。我的意思是，当然，每个人都会提到**富兰克林·罗斯福**，以及他打破了很多规范，在新政计划中非常积极地使用行政权力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan Swan**: Well, we have lots of precedents of presidents. I mean, of course, everyone references **Franklin Roosevelt** and him breaking a lot of norms, very aggressive use of executive power with the **New Deal** programs.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 不过得到了**国会**的认可，这是很大的不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Endorsed by **Congress** though, big difference.

</details>

**Jonathan Swan**: 确实。而且，当你看到过去发生重大滥用时，通常是在战时。所以，你知道，**伍德罗·威尔逊**对新闻界和公民社会、工会进行了可怕的滥用，显然**富兰克林·罗斯福**的**拘留营**。但再次强调，在非战时，我们现在没有处于大萧条时期。对于如此广泛的积极主张行政权力，甚至包括我们现在看到**唐纳德·特朗普**使用的许多行政权力实例，都没有先例。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan Swan**: Definitely. And when you've seen huge abuses in the past, it's generally been in wartime. So, you know, **Woodrow Wilson**, there were terrible abuses against the press and civil society, unions, obviously **Franklin Roosevelt** with the **internment camps**. But again, in non-wartime, we're not in the middle of a great depression. There is no precedent for the breadth of aggressive assertion of executive power and even many of the instances of executive power that we're seeing used right now by **Donald Trump**.

</details>

### 权力的“单向棘轮”效应

**Jonathan Swan**: 我认为还有一点非常重要，我们还没有谈到，那就是我认为**唐纳德·特朗普**很可能成为我们一生中影响最深远的总统的原因之一是，在我看来，在这次经历之后，我们不太可能回到以前的状态。我们现在所处的环境是，没有一个庞大的选民群体支持一位“复辟主义”总统，让人们说：“哦，实际上，我真的希望下一任总统能自愿约束自己，谨慎行事，并尊重**权力制衡**。”更有可能的是，如果另一方上台，如果民主党上台，他们的选民会希望看到总统利用所有这些**过度权力**来实现他们的政策愿望和政策目标。这是一种非常有吸引力的东西。所以，你现在看到**特朗普**以各种方式单方面行事，这为所有追随他的领导人打开了一个新的局面。我们会看到像**尼克松**之后那样的反应吗？你知道，**卡特**基本上是以“良好政府”和“克制”等理念竞选的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan Swan**: And I think there's another point that's really important that we haven't talked about yet, which is one reason why I think it's very likely that **Donald Trump** ends up being the most consequential president of our lifetimes is that it seems to me very unlikely that we go back to the way it was before after this experience. We're in an environment where there's not a huge constituency for a restorationist president for people to say, "Oh, actually, I really hope the next president will voluntarily restrain themselves and exercise prudence and respect the **balance of powers**." What's far more likely is that if the other side gets in, if Democrats get in, that their voters are going to want to see a president use all of these **extravagant powers** for their policy desires and policy goals. That is a very appealing thing. And so you you've seen now **Trump** act unilaterally in all sorts of ways that has now opened up a new panorama for every other leader who follows him. Are we going to see a reaction like we saw post **Nixon**, you know, where **Carter** essentially ran on good government restraint and all this sort of stuff?

</details>

**Jonathan Swan**: 我不知道。这是一个非常不同的背景。与那时相比，这是一个非常不同的背景。所以，我认为**特朗普**更有可能设定一个将被遵循，甚至可能被扩大的先例，尽管这很难想象，而不是我们会看到某种形式的恢复到**唐纳德·特朗普**之后的状态。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan Swan**: I don't know. It's a very different context. It's a very different context than it was back then. And so I think **Trump** is more likely to have set a precedent that will be followed, perhaps even expanded upon, as hard as that might be to imagine, than it is that will have some sort of restoration to the way it was after **Donald Trump**.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 对吧？**汉普蒂·邓普蒂**再也拼不回去了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Right? That **Humpty Dumpty** doesn't get put back together again.

</details>

**Maggie Haberman**: 完全正确。我认为**Jonathan**提出了一个非常重要的观点，那就是在我们现在生活的这个世界里，两党，我不是说它们以完全相同的方式或完全相同的程度发生，但它们彼此之间都变得激进化了。你知道，**1月6日**对民主党和一些在国会经历过它的共和党人来说是一个激进化的日子。**特朗普**和他的顾问们则被两次**暗杀企图**、两次**弹劾努力**、各种**起诉**、所有人都被传唤所激进化。他的许多顾问和许多在**白宫**工作过的人在离开后都找不到工作。所以，每个人都处于高度戒备状态，每个人都认为他们使用权力的方式是正确的。如果我这样做，那是因为它是为了正确的事业。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Maggie Haberman**: Totally. And I think **Jonathan** raises a really important point, which is that in this world we're living in now where both parties, I'm not saying it's taking place exactly the same way or exactly the same levels, but they're radicalized about each other. You know, **January 6th** was a radicalizing day for Democrats and some Republicans who lived through it in the capital. **Trump** and his advisers have been radicalized by two **assassination attempts**, two **impeachment efforts**, various **indictments**, all of them getting subpoenaed. Many of his advisers and many people who worked in that **White House** unable to get jobs after they left. So, everybody is on heightened alert and everybody thinks that their use of power is the right one. If I do it this way, it's because it's for the right cause.

</details>

**Charlie Savage**: 我可以插一句吗？我很多关于记录行政权力的工作，可以追溯到70年代的**切尼**经历，以及这如何影响了**布什政府**等等，都围绕着这样一个观点：**行政权力**就像一个**单向棘轮**，它更容易扩大，而不是回滚。因为一个人无论做什么，下一个人都会将其作为基线，然后进一步创新，然后那又成为新的基线。我认为这是我们所看到的行政权力增长的一个事实，不仅在**特朗普**时期，而且在导致这一时刻的几代人中都是如此。所以，如果**Jonathan**和**Maggie**是对的，并且有一位民主党总统也抛弃了所有对法治、制衡和自我约束规范的关注，那将符合这种模式。当你说它有吸引力时，我的意思是，可能在集会上人群高喊的那一刻它有吸引力。但我认为，就一个不会真正与自己开战的国家而言，它作为一种处方是极其没有吸引力的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Charlie Savage**: If I could jump in just for a second, you know, a lot of my work chronicling executive power going back to the **Cheney** experiences in the 70s and how that informed the **Bush administration** and so forth has centered around this idea that **executive power** acts like a **one-way ratchet** and that it's easier to make it larger than to roll it back again because whatever one guy does, the next guy takes as a baseline and then innovates further and then that becomes the new baseline. And I think that is a truth about what we see in the growth of executive power, not just under **Trump**, but under the generations leading up to this moment. So if **Jonathan** and **Maggie** are right and there is a Democratic president who also jettisons all this caring about the rule of law and in checks and balances and norms of self-constraint that would fit that pattern. When you say it's appealing, I mean, possibly it's appealing in the moment in the in the crowd yelling at the rally. I think it's profoundly unappealing in terms of a recipe for a country that is not literally go to war with itself.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 因为这意味着，如果掌权者完全不受约束，没有制衡，法治毫无意义，也没有规范，那么那一派继续掌权就成了生死攸关的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Because it means that every if if everyone whoever is in power is completely unconstrained and there are no checks and balances and the rule of law means nothing and there are no norms, then it's existential that that side stays in power.

</details>

**Maggie Haberman**: 完全正确。如果另一方上台，那么那一方就会认为自己会进监狱，因为他们刚刚违反了所有这些法律。必须通过战争来阻止另一方上台。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Maggie Haberman**: Exactly. And the other side comes in, then that side thinks it's going to go to prison because they just broke all these laws. There has to be a war to prevent the other side from coming in.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 这是一个你必须消灭对手的政府。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: It's a government of it's a government in which you have to annihilate your opponents.

</details>

**Jonathan Swan**: **Charlie**，当我与**特朗普**身边的一些人交谈时，他们现在在心理上就是这种状态。下一次选举是决定一切的。他们无法忍受失去权力的想法，因为这种动态。我同意，我不是说这对我很有吸引力。我是说，总统任期内一个精力充沛、行动果断的人，能够轻而易举地让事情发生，这种想法非常有吸引力，我认为我们如果认为它没有吸引力，那是非常天真的。所以，为了结束这场非常引人入胜的对话的前半部分，我们能否正式宣布，在这个第二任期的一年里，我们的民主制度已经发生了根本性的变化？我们不能一本正经地说，根据你们所有人在这里阐述的一切，我们真的在谈论三个独立但平等的政府部门，考虑到这种权力的巩固、个人化和法典化。显然，说我们正在看到三个平等的部门是荒谬的，看看**国会**，我的意思是，你如何能一本正经地争辩说，国会以其运作方式是一个独立的、平等的部门？我的意思是，这太荒谬了。所以，你知道，我无法想象你如何能以一种知识上诚实的方式提出这种论点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan Swan**: **Charlie**, when I talk to certain people around **Trump**, that's where they are psychologically right now. That the next election is for all the marbles. They cannot it's it's in it's intolerable the thought of losing power because of that dynamic. I agree with I'm not saying it's appealing to me. I'm saying the the idea of an energetic man of action in the presidency who can click his fingers and make things happen is very appealing and I think we're very naive to think that it's not. So just to end the first half of this really fascinating conversation, can we call it officially a year into this second term that our democracy, our democratic system has fundamentally changed? That we can't with a straight face say based on everything you have all laid out here that we're really talking about three separate but equal branches of government given the consolidation the personalization and the codification of power in this presidency it's obviously absurd to say that we're looking at three equally like look at **Congress** I mean how could you possibly argue with a straight face that **Congress** is a separate co-equal branch in the way it's been operating. I mean, it's an absurdity. So, you know, I can't imagine how you could in an intellectually honest way make that case.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 而且，如果我们要把它升级，**Charlie**，如果它只朝一个方向发展，那不就意味着美国民主制度的根本性改变吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: And if we're going to ratchet it up, **Charlie**, if it only goes in one direction, doesn't that mean something fundamental has changed here in the American system of democracy?

</details>

**Charlie Savage**: 很难说我们2025年所看到的一切会是永久性的，会是未来一直如此。现在，我认为，美国式的民主制度、**权力制衡**以及拥有共同平等控制权的独立机构，在**特朗普**第二任期的第一年里，美国并没有这样运作。你知道，整个系统现在病得很重。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Charlie Savage**: It's hard to say that this is like a permanent entrenchment of what we saw in the year 2025 is the way it's always going to be going forward. Now I think certainly though the American style system of democracy and **checks and balances** and separated institutions wielding co-equal control over the government is not how America has functioned in the first year of the **Trump** second term. And you know the whole system is very sick right now.

### 海外权力干预

**Michael Bubaro**: 好的，当我们回来时，我们将讨论这个第一任期以及总统使用权力的多少，令我惊讶的是，不知道你们是否也一样，最终发生在海外。我们马上回来。**Charlie**、**Maggie**和**Jonathan**，正如我休息前所说，他第二任期第一年最令人惊讶的特点之一是总统在海外使用这种**巩固权力**的方式。让我提醒你们几点，也许你们甚至不需要提醒。他部署了美国轰炸机摧毁**伊朗**的核设施。他干预了**以色列**和**加沙**之间的战争，并成功推动了一项和平协议，释放了那里的人质。他试图在**俄罗斯**和**乌克兰**之间进行和平谈判。他使用特种部队除掉了**尼古拉斯·马杜罗**。他曾威胁要接管**格陵兰岛**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Well, when we come back, we're going to talk about how much of this first term and the president's use of power, to my surprise, wonder if it's to yours as well, ended up happening overseas. We'll be right back. **Charlie** and **Maggie** and **Jonathan**, as I said before the break, one of the most surprising qualities of this first year of his second term has been the way that the president has used this **consolidated power** overseas. And let me just offer a few reminders that you may not even need. He has deployed US bombers to take out **Iran's** nuclear facilities. He has intervened in the war between **Israel** and **Gaza** and successfully pushed for a peace deal that released the hostages there. He has tried to negotiate peace between **Russia** and **Ukraine**. He has used special forces to take out **Nicholas Maduro**. He has threatened to take over **Greenland**.

</details>

**Jonathan Swan**: 这次很多重点不在美国。我认为你刚才列出的清单的问题在于，**Michael**，它包含了非常传统的总统权力表达，在一个有很多回旋余地的领域，你知道，在执行**外交政策**的能力方面。所以，总统试图谈判结束世界上任何地方的战争是完全传统的。我们真正进入，再次使用这个词，**过度使用权力**的领域，是在**Charlie**一直在报道的那些方面，即仅仅因为**唐纳德·特朗普**这么说，就宣布在船上运输可卡因的人是武装战斗人员和恐怖分子，因此我不会逮捕他们，我只会炸毁并杀死他们。或者，你知道，派遣**三角洲特种部队**去清除一个外国主权者。这些是他真正测试极限的领域，而你提到的许多其他领域，我认为他使用权力的方式相当传统。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan Swan**: This was a lot of emphasis not on America. I think the problem with the list you just laid out, **Michael**, is that it contains very conventional expressions of, you know, presidential power in an area where there is a lot of leeway, you know, in terms of the ability to conduct **foreign policy**. So, it is completely conventional for a president to try to negotiate the end to a war in any part of the world. Where we get into really, to use the word again, **extravagant uses of power** is in the areas that **Charlie** has been reporting on so much, which is declaring just because **Donald Trump** says so that people who are transporting cocaine on boats are armed combatants and terrorists and therefore I won't arrest them, I will just blow them up and kill them. Or, you know, sending **Delta Force** in to remove a foreign sovereign. Those are the areas where he's really testing things in a lot of the other areas that you mentioned. I think it's quite conventional the way that he's using power.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 这种区分非常有帮助。我的意思是，**Charlie**，既然**Jonathan**提到了，并且认为我的清单大部分是传统的，但他特别指出。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: That's very helpful that distinction. I mean, **Charlie**, since **Jonathan** brings it up and dismisses much of my list as conventional, but zeros in,

</details>

**Charlie Savage**: 我会把轰炸**伊朗**列入越线的清单，但谈判和平协议肯定不是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Charlie Savage**: I would throw bombing **Iran** into the list of things that are across the line, but certainly negotiating peace deals is not.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 当你说越线时，请描述你的意思以及为什么它很重要，因为正如**Jonathan**所说，美国总统在动用美国军队方面一直拥有非凡的自由裁量权。嗯，追溯到过去，两党总统都为自己开辟了在某些情况下无需**国会**批准即可单方面在海外使用美国军事力量的能力。这些情况基本上是，存在国家利益，并且预期敌对行动的范围、持续时间、性质未达到宪法意义上的战争。所以，一次性空袭、维和行动、小规模干预。轰炸**伊朗**被视为越线，因为它造成了如此大的区域冲突风险，以至于预期可能导致全面战争的风险意味着，如果我们打算越过那条线，**国会**需要从一开始就参与进来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: And when you say cross the line, describe what you mean and why it matters because presidents of the **United States** have always, as **Jonathan** has said, exercised an extraordinary amount of discretion when it comes to the use of the **US military**. Well, presidents of both parties going back have carved out for themselves an ability to use American military force abroad unilaterally without going to **Congress** under certain circumstances. The circumstances are basically incidences where there's a national interest in the anticipated scope, duration, nature of the hostilities fall short of war in the constitutional sense. So, one-off air strikes, peacekeeping operations, small-scale interventions. Bombing **Iran** was seen as across the line because it created such a risk of a major regional conflagration that the anticipated risk that it could lead to a full-scale war meant **Congress** needed to be involved from the beginning if we were going to cross that line.

</details>

**Charlie Savage**: 船只袭击和**委内瑞拉**的**马杜罗**行动肯定属于这一类。**特朗普**正在为自己承担权力，基本上是命令对那些一直被视为刑事嫌疑人的人进行即决法外处决，而他们被怀疑犯下的罪行甚至不是死罪，而是**贩毒**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Charlie Savage**: The boat strikes and the **Venezuela Maduro** operation certainly in that category. **Trump** is assuming for himself the power to essentially order the summary extrajudicial executions of people who had always been treated as criminal suspects and the crime they are suspected of committing not even a capital offense that is **drug trafficking**.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Mhm.

</details>

**Charlie Savage**: 他通过一种“凭空捏造”的法律现实，你知道，引号中的“现实”来做到这一点。我认定与一份秘密的**贩毒集团**和**犯罪团伙**名单存在法律上的正式武装冲突状态，因此，那些被怀疑为他们走私毒品的船上人员不是罪犯。他们是战斗人员，因此我指挥美国军方立即杀死他们是合法的。我的意思是，这是一件非同寻常的事情。政府之外没有人认为真的存在武装冲突，但谁会在政府内部挑战他呢？显然，军方不会，特别是因为他们的**军法署**已经被**国防部长皮特·赫克斯**掏空了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Charlie Savage**: He's done so through a sort of conjuring into existence legal realities, you know, realities in quotation marks. I determine that there is an legal formal state of armed conflict with a secret list of **drug cartels** and criminal gangs and that therefore the people on boats suspected of smuggling narcotics for them are not criminals. They are combatants and therefore it is lawful for me to direct the **US military** to kill them summarily. I mean that's an extraordinary thing. No one thinks that outside of the government that there is actually an armed conflict, but who's going to challenge him inside the government? Clearly, the military is not, especially because their **Jag core** has been gutted by **Secretary of Defense Pete Hex**.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: **军法署**是军队中的律师，他们可能会发表意见说不要这样做。他们的目的是向军事指挥官提供关于遵守法律的法律建议。法律规定，军队不允许以平民为目标，即使他们涉嫌犯罪，如果他们不构成迫在眉睫的威胁。那在和平时期就是谋杀。在武装冲突中，那是战争罪。尽管如此，军方正在执行**特朗普**的命令。现在，随着对**委内瑞拉**的袭击，在另一个主权国家的土地上使用地面部队，在那里他们杀死了80人并实现了政权更迭。他说他也可以这样做，在这种情况下，以执法行动为幌子。所以他们可以通过说那不是执法调查，那是战争来打击毒品走私者。然后他们可以未经国会授权就向另一个国家的外国领土派遣军队，通过说那不是战争，那只是执法行动。这是一系列非同寻常的事件。它证明了我们前半部分讨论的主题，即你可以做任何事情，特别是如果你雇佣了合适的律师，他们不会提出异议，而是会找到方法制作一份写着“是的，你可以做你想做的事情”的文件，谁能阻止你呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: **Jag core** are the lawyers in the military who might issue opinions saying don't do that. Whose purpose is to provide legal advice to military commanders about obeying the law. And the law says militaries are not allowed to target civilians even if they are suspected of crimes if they pose no imminent threat. That is murder and peace time. That is a war crime in an armed conflict. Nevertheless, the military is doing what **Trump** is telling them to do. And now with the raid into **Venezuela**, using ground troops on the sovereign soil of another country in a place where they killed 80 people and effectuated regime change. And he says he can do that too in this case under the guise of being a law enforcement operation. So they can combat drug smugglers by saying that's not a law enforcement investigation, that's war. And then they can send troops in to the foreign territory of another country without congressional authorization by saying that's not war, that is just a law enforcement operation. It's just an extraordinary set of events. It is a demonstration of the theme we were talking about in the first half of this of you can just do stuff and especially if you've hired the right lawyers who are not going to raise objections but are going to find ways to produce a piece of paper with some words on it that says yes you can do what you want to do who's going to stop you.

</details>

**Jonathan Swan**: **Jonathan**，如果这些干预措施有什么共同点的话，我在这里可能会有点挑衅，那就是目前它们似乎对美国来说结果都相当不错。让我给你们举一些例子。当我们思考总统过去一年在外交事务上的做法时，结果是**北约**为自己的国防支付了比以往任何时候都多的费用，从而减轻了美国财政部的负担。美国现在受到**拉丁美洲**领导人的恐惧，他们与**贩毒集团**有重大问题。我们看到这些政府，例如**墨西哥**，事实证明，当他们感到受到**唐纳德·特朗普**的威胁时，他们可以做更多的事情来打击这些贩毒集团。所以，请思考一下，尽管其中一些行动在法律上存在疑问，但它们似乎确实符合美国的国家利益。嗯，我一点也不觉得这难以理解。这正是我之前想说的重点，即仅仅因为某事不合法或至少在法律上存在争议，并不意味着它没有吸引力，或者不会给美国带来一些好处。所以，他在**伊朗**和**委内瑞拉**授权的两次主要军事行动，都没有造成美国军人死亡。我的意思是，无论你如何看待清除**马杜罗**的行动，无论你认为它是否明智，那都是一次惊人的军事实力展示。如果你是**唐纳德·特朗普**，你取得了如此辉煌的军事成功，然后得到了赞扬和恐惧的强化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan Swan**: **Jonathan** what may unify these interventions if anything and I'm going to be a little bit provocative here is that for now they have seemed to turn out pretty well for the **United States**. And let me just give you some examples. When we think about the president's approach to foreign affairs this entire past year, it ends with a **NATO** that's paying more than ever for its own defense, which therefore puts less burden on the **US Treasury**. The **United States** is now feared by **Latin American** leaders who have major problems with **drug cartels**. And we're seeing that those governments, look at **Mexico** for example, it turns out, can do a heck of a lot more to fight those cartels when they feel threatened by **Donald Trump**. So just reckon with that for a minute that as legally dubious as some of these actions have been, they do appear to serve the **US national interest**. Well, I don't find this difficult to reckon with at all. And this is kind of the point I was getting at earlier, which is that just because something is unlawful or at least legally contested doesn't mean that it's not appealing or doesn't get some good for America. So the two major military operations that he has authorized in **Iran** and in **Venezuela** resulted in no American service members dying. I mean, whatever you think about the operation to get rid of **Maduro**, whether you think it was wise, it was an astonishing display of military prowess. And if you're **Donald Trump** and you pull off such spectacular military successes and then get the reinforcement of the praise and the fear,

</details>

**Jonathan Swan**: 它是**自我强化**的。这就是为什么你现在看到他说：“那么**格陵兰岛**呢？那么**古巴**呢？那么**伊朗**的政权更迭呢？”他会继续在所有这些情况下都走运吗？我们不知道。我们仍然处于总统任期的早期。但我想说的是，关于你所说的，你知道，整体看待这个问题，欧洲人现在确实在国防上投入更多。**唐纳德·特朗普**成功地让他们做了一些其他总统没有做到的事情，他应该为此受到赞扬。但同样真实的是，如果你用冷静、清晰的眼光看待这个问题，美国的传统盟友将不会回到他们过去信任美国的方式，以及至少在**特朗普**第二任期之前存在的那些联盟的性质，因为他们总是知道美国可能会回到这一点。即使我们确实出现了一些“复辟主义”类型的人物，说**北约**，你知道，每个人都需要手牵手，他们现在已经有了这样一种生活经验，即一位美国总统说我们要占领这片领土，你知道，去他的。你只能接受它。所以，现在，在**唐纳德·特朗普**总统任期一年后，很难对美国的国家利益做出长期评估。**唐纳德·特朗普**的权力方式将在某些领域为美国带来积极的东西。也可能会有代价。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan Swan**: It's **self-reinforcing**. And that's why you see him now saying, "Well, what about **Greenland**? What about **Cuba**? What about a regime change in **Iran**? Is he just going to continue to get lucky in all these circumstances? We don't know. We're still very early in the presidency. But what I would say to your point about, you know, looking at this holistically, it's true that the Europeans are now spending more on their defense. **Donald Trump** has managed to get them to do something that other presidents have not, and he should be credited for that. But what's also true, if you're looking at this with cold, clear eyes, is that America's traditional allies will not go back to the way they were in terms of trusting America and the nature of those alliances that predated at least the second **Trump** presidency because they can always know that America could go back to this point. Even if we do get some restorationist type figure who's saying **NATO's**, you know, everyone needs to hold hands, they've now had this lived experience of an American president that says we're going to take this territory and, you know, to hell with you. You're just going to have to live with it. So, it's very hard to make long-term assessments about the American national interest right now, a year into the **Donald Trump** presidency. There are going to be areas where **Donald Trump's** approach to power extracts positive things for America. There are also going to potentially be costs.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 甚至可能对他全球舞台上的行为造成非常重大的代价。**Maggie**，让我们暂时回到国内战线。第二任期的一个谜团是，这位总统，我看着你，因为你确实为他写了一本传记，他深深渴望认可和肯定。然而民意调查显示，选民对他从经济到移民再到他的一些海外干预等各种关键问题的认可度，在他第二任期的第一年里一直在下降。对我来说，问题是为什么这个第二任期被定义为他认为重要的事情与投票让他上台的选民认为重要的事情之间的脱节，特别是对于一个被渴望认可所定义的人来说。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: And maybe even very significant costs to the way that he's acting on the global stage. **Maggie**, to bring it back to the domestic front for a moment, one of the riddles of the second term is that this is a president, and I looking at you because you literally wrote a biography of him, who deeply craves approval and affirmation. And yet polling shows that voters approval of him on a wide variety of key issues from the economy to immigration to some of his overseas interventions has been on the decline throughout this first year of his second term. And the question to me anyway is why is this second term being defined by a disconnect on what's important to him and what's important to the voters who put him into this office, especially for someone who has been defined by the desire for affirmation.

</details>

### 特朗普的“赔偿时代”与信息茧房

**Maggie Haberman**: 当然。这已经出现了很多次。我的意思是，简单的答案，我们从总统身边的多人那里听到，就是他只是有点不在乎了。我的意思是，他只是想做他想做的事情。我们谈到了**唐纳德·特朗普**的“**赔偿时代**”，不仅仅是为了他自己，而是为了生活中的一切。你知道，他觉得他第一次总统任期没有享受到，因为**俄罗斯调查**和**弹劾**等等。现在他觉得他只是想做他想做的事情。他自己也不会再次出现在选票上。所以除非对他有直接影响，否则他不在乎。是的，他没有得到他想要的媒体报道。这是真的，至少在主流媒体中是这样。但他从**福克斯新闻**等渠道得到了大量的赞扬，**福克斯新闻**在第一任期实际上并没有如此全力支持他。他让商界领袖们争先恐后地赞扬他，给他钱，告诉他所做的一切都很棒。我想说的是，关于**外交政策**，这是他的一贯主线。他从未像被全球舞台上的角色所吸引那样，投入到国内政策中，这可以追溯到40年前。我的意思是，如果你回顾他80年代所做的一切，他都在努力被视为**核物理**专家，或者一个能够得到**里根**关注的人，或者一个可以与**戈尔巴乔夫**会面的人，所以他现在正以这种方式得到认可。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Maggie Haberman**: Sure. This has come up a lot. I mean, the simple answer, and we hear this from multiple people close to the president, is he just sort of doesn't care the same way. I mean, he is just going to do what he wants. We talked about the **reparations era of Donald Trump**, not just for self, but just sort of for life, for everything. You know, he felt like he didn't get to enjoy his presidency the first time because of the **Russia investigation** and impeachments and so forth and so on. And now he feels like he is just going to do what he wants. And he is not on the ballot again himself. And so unless there is a direct impact to him, he doesn't care. And yes, he's not getting the media coverage that he wants. That is true, at least in the mainstream media. But he is getting a lot of lavish praise from quarters like **Fox News**, which actually wasn't this all-in for him in term one. He has business leaders sort of tripping over themselves. Um, and he's being to praise him and to give him money and to tell him everything he's doing is fantastic. And the thing that I I did want to say about **foreign policy** that's the through line with him. He's never been as engaged on domestic policy as he has been captivated by being seen as a player on the global stage going back 40 years. I mean if you go back and you look at everything he was doing in the 80s it was trying to be seen as an expert on **nuclear physics** or somebody who you know might be able to get **Reagan's** ear or somebody who could meet with **Gorbachev** and so he's now being recognized that way.

</details>

**Jonathan Swan**: 令人着迷。他生活在一个非常非常孤立的**信息茧房**中，这似乎一点也不困扰他。如果开始困扰他，我们拭目以待。但他满足于得到他需要的所有赞扬。我的意思是，**Jonathan**，感觉就像，暂停在一年这个节点进行这次对话的用处在于，如果**MAGA主义**/**特朗普主义**一直都是总统和选民之间的一种交易，那么感觉他在这次交易中的位置已经结束了。哦，我看得太不一样了。我根本不认为这是一种交易。我认为**唐纳德·特朗普**是一个，你知道，我们滥用了“魅力”这个词，但从历史上理解的真正魅力，是与某人建立情感联系的能力。那是**唐纳德·特朗普**运动的核心。对我来说，最大的问题是，当**唐纳德·特朗普**离开舞台，一位更传统的政治家上台时，让我们面对现实，我们正在讨论的每一个潜在继任者，从**JD·万斯**往下，都不是**唐纳德·特朗普**。那个人能否将这个不可能的联盟凝聚在一起，其中包括**林赛·格雷厄姆**和**塔克·卡尔森**？那些彼此鄙视、在关键问题上截然相反的人，**唐纳德·特朗普**通过一种近乎超自然的力量将他们凝聚在一起，无论你怎么称呼它，但一个更传统的政治家能否将这个联盟凝聚在一起？我非常怀疑。所以，选民越是认为**唐纳德·特朗普**，“是的，我在某种程度上仍然喜欢他，但他在问题X、问题Y、问题Z上让我失望了。”那么承担代价的受害者，不太可能是**唐纳德·特朗普**，而更可能是**JD·万斯**或他的继任者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan Swan**: Fascinating. And he is living in a very very isolated **information bubble** and it doesn't seem to bother him at all. If it starts to, we'll see. But he's content that he's getting all the praise he needs. I mean **Jonathan** it just feels like and this is what's useful about pausing at a year mark and having this conversation is that if **MAGAism** **Trumpism** was always a transaction between the president and the electorate it feels like his place in this transaction is kind of over. Oh, I see it so differently. I I don't think it's a transaction at all. I think **Donald Trump** is a, you know, we misuse the word charisma, but actual charisma historically understood, the ability to have an emotional connection with someone. That's the heart of the **Donald Trump** movement. And to me, the big question is when **Donald Trump** leaves the scene and a more conventional politician comes in, and let's face it, every one of the people that we're discussing as potential successes to him from **JD Vance** on down are not **Donald Trump** on this. Can that person glue together this impossible coalition which includes **Lindsey Graham** and **Tucker Carlson**? People who despise each other, who diametrically opposed on key issues, **Donald Trump** glues them together through an almost sort of supernatural, whatever you want to call it, but like can a more conventional politician glue together that coalition? Like I'm very skeptical. So the more that voters view **Donald Trump** as, "Yeah, I I still kind of like him at some gut level, but he's disappointed me on issue X, issue Y, issue Z." The victim or the person who bears the costs of that is less likely to be **Donald Trump** than it is to be **JD Vance** or whoever succeeds him.

### 关键时刻与未来展望

**Michael Bubaro**: 嗯，我们还有三年时间来弄清楚谁将成为**唐纳德·特朗普**的政治继承人，**Jonathan**。所以，我们暂时把这个问题搁置。我想问你们三位一个有点出人意料的问题。我很好奇过去一年中哪个特定时刻让你们印象深刻。不一定是最重要的时刻，而是对你们来说，它是迄今为止这个第二任期最具启发性和代表性的时刻。对我来说，那真的是关于夏天对**杰弗里·爱泼斯坦**文件、文档、材料，无论你怎么称呼它，的初步处理。为什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Well, we have three more years to figure out who will emerge as the political heir to **Donald Trump**, **Jonathan**. So, let's table that for the moment. I want to ask the three of you a bit of a curveball. I'm curious what specific moment of this past year stands out to you. Not necessarily in the classic it was the most important moment sense, but because for you it was the most revealing and embodying of this second term so far. For me, it really was about the initial handling in the summer of the **Jeffrey Epstein** files, documents, material, whatever you want to call it. Why?

</details>

**Jonathan Swan**: 这是**特朗普**将他的总统任期个人化的另一个例子，从某种意义上说，对他而言，他从未如此痴迷于**杰弗里·爱泼斯坦**事件。我的意思是，他确实在2015年谈到过**比尔·克林顿**等人的背景，但他从未将此事视为他的生命线。然而，对于他的许多支持者来说，这却是一个驱动力。这在他自己和他的支持者某些方面之间存在着根本性的脱节。对我来说，这是我们第一次真正看到这种脱节。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan Swan**: This is another example of **Trump** personalizing his presidency in the sense that for him, he was never that obsessed with the **Jeffrey Epstein** matter. I mean, he did talk about it in 2015 in the context of **Bill Clinton** and so forth, but he was never somebody who made this his lifeblood. Whereas it has been a driving force for a lot of his supporters. And there was just this fundamental disconnect between himself and aspects of his base on this. And this was the first time, at least for me, that we really saw that.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: **Charlie**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: **Charlie**,

</details>

**Charlie Savage**: 嗯，我花了很多时间撰写关于**委内瑞拉**和船只袭击的文章。我选择九月，当时他让一些人在**椭圆形办公室**处理一个完全不相关的问题，他突然漫不经心地说：“顺便说一句，我们今天早上把一些人炸飞了。你们会听到更多关于这件事的消息。”几分钟后，他在他的**Truth Social**社交媒体平台上发布了任何政府都会视为高度机密的袭击录像。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Charlie Savage**: Well, I spent so much time writing about **Venezuela** and the boat strikes. I'll I'll pick in September when he's got some people in the **Oval Office** for a completely unrelated issue and he suddenly just kind of casually remarks, "By the way, we blew some people out of the water this morning. You're going to be hearing more about that." And then a few minutes later posts on his **Truth Social** social media platform what any administration would treat as highly classified footage of this attack.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 并且使用这个完全个人化的媒体**truthsocial.com**发布这段极其官方和重要的录像，这令人震惊。没有其他总统会这样做，当然也没有其他总统会以这种方式公开展示它。**Jonathan**，你呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: And using this entirely personalized medium **truthsocial.com** to put out this extremely official important footage was striking. No other president would have done that at all but certainly no other president would have done it the public presentation of it in that way. **Jonathan**, what about you?

</details>

**Jonathan Swan**: 唉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan Swan**: [sighs]

</details>

**Jonathan Swan**: 大概有两个时刻。我知道这不符合规则，但是，嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan Swan**: There are sort of two moments. I know that's not the rule, but um.

</details>

**Maggie Haberman**: 哦，我不知道我们可以这样做。我本来也会这样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Maggie Haberman**: Oh, I didn't know we could do that. I would have done that.

</details>

**Jonathan Swan**: 首先。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan Swan**: The first.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 你在违反规范。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: You're violating norms.

</details>

**Jonathan Swan**: 完全正确。规范，而不是法律。它们实际上都是图像。视频。第一个是就职典礼上的**科技亿万富翁**们。因为如果我们接受**人工智能**可能与上个世纪的伟大突破一样具有变革性，甚至更具变革性，那么**唐纳德·特朗普**在释放**人工智能**方面，让这些人基本上得到他们想要的一切，将美国带向了一个非常不同的方向。如果你思考他所做的事情中哪些会比他更长久，那将是其中之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan Swan**: Exactly. Norms, not laws. They're both images actually. Video. The first was the **tech billionaires** on the dis at the inauguration. Because if we accept that **AI** is potentially as transformative, if not more transformative than the great breakthroughs of the last century, **Donald Trump** has taken America in a very different direction in terms of unleashing **AI**, giving these guys basically everything they want. If you think about what are the things that he does that are going to outlast him, that's going to be one of them.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 这可能是最具持久变革性的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: This could be the most lastingly transformational.

</details>

**Jonathan Swan**: 可能是。除了他改变总统任期的方式，另一个是**查理·柯克**的遇刺。那是一个可怕的时刻。我无法将那段视频从我的脑海中抹去。我前一天还和**查理·柯克**谈过。你知道，一个我经常打交道的人。虽然**查理**的死是一个可怕的悲剧，但它也为**特朗普政府**提供了一个机会，去做他们中的许多人，包括**唐纳德·特朗普**，一直想做的事情，那就是利用政府权力压制左翼，瓦解左翼，打击制度化的左翼，左翼的主要团体。如果我们看到未来12个月内**司法部**努力瓦解、起诉左翼大团体，那么这次可怕的暗杀可能成为那个故事的真正催化剂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jonathan Swan**: It could. Besides the the way he's changed the presidency, the other one is the assassination of **Charlie Kirk**. It was a horrifying moment. I can't get that video out of my head. I talked to **Charlie Kirk** the day before he was assassinated. You know, someone that I dealt with a lot. While **Charlie's** death was a horrible tragedy, it was also an opportunity for the **Trump administration** to do what many of them have wanted to do, including **Donald Trump**, which is use government power to crush the left, to dismantle the left, to go after the institutional left, the major groups on the left. If we do see in the next 12 months efforts by the **Justice Department** to dismantle, prosecute the left's big groups, this horrible assassination could be a real catalyst of that story.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 我想通过请你们三位简要展望本届任期的剩余时间，以及在过去365天左右做了这么多事情之后，他还有什么事情可做来结束这次对话。在他做了所有这些事情之后，他实际上还剩下什么可做的？**Maggie**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: I want to end this conversation by asking the three of you to briefly look ahead to the rest of the term and what is left for him to do after doing so much in these past 365 or so days. What's actually left for him to do after everything he has done? **Maggie**.

</details>

**Maggie Haberman**: 嗯，我们来看看他以起诉形式进行的**复仇之旅**。他一直对法院阻挠他、**司法部**有时阻挠他、职业检察官辞职并表示他们不会继续进行感到沮丧。坦率地说，这让我想起了2021年**1月6日**前夕，当时他正在寻找任何愿意给他想要的东西的人。正如他的一位朋友告诉我的那样，他总是喜欢那些“无所不为”的律师。现实是，他真的喜欢那些只要他要求，就会“无所不为”的人。所以，目前还没有人被定罪，没有人被关进监狱。

**Maggie Haberman**: Well, let's just take his **revenge tour** specifically in the form of prosecutions he wants to see. He has gotten frustrated that courts have stymied him, that the **Justice Department** at times has stymied him, that career prosecutors have quit and said that they're not going to go ahead with things. It reminds me very much, frankly, of the leadup to, you know, **January 6, 2021**, when he was looking for anyone who would give him what he wanted. He always likes, as one of his friends said to me, lawyers who will do anything. The reality is he really likes fill-in-lank who will do anything, you know, if he asks them to. And so no one has been convicted, no one has been put in jail.

**Michael Bubaro**: 所以那项工作尚未完成。

**Michael Bubaro**: So that work is unfinished.

**Maggie Haberman**: 对他来说。

**Maggie Haberman**: For him.

**Michael Bubaro**: 是的。他已经非常明确地向身边的人表示，那项工作尚未完成。

<details>

**Michael Bubaro**: Yes. And he has made quite clear vocally to people around him that that work is unfinished.

**Michael Bubaro**: 嗯。**Jonathan**。

**Michael Bubaro**: Mhm. **Jonathan**,

**Jonathan Swan**: **唐纳德·特朗普**，我不是说他有一个完全成熟的框架，但我认为在直觉层面，他非常认同将世界划分为**势力范围**的观念。这意味着美国是**西半球**的霸主，美国对其自己的邻国拥有完全的统治权。你知道，**委内瑞拉**是第51个州，**加拿大**是第52个州，你知道，以此类推。但这可能也为**中国**夺取**台湾**留下了空间，为**俄罗斯**显然将在这次战争中获得大量土地留下了空间，无论最终达成何种安排。这将很有趣地看到它如何演变，显然这次对话的中心是**唐纳德·特朗普**与**习近平**和**弗拉基米尔·普京**的关系，以及他将向他们做出哪些让步，他会给他们多少空间来对他们的邻国施加自己的统治。

**Jonathan Swan**: **Donald Trump**, I'm not saying he has a fully developed framework for this, but I think at an instinctive level, he's quite sympathetic to the notion of dividing the world up into **spheres of influence**. Meaning America is the hegemon in the **western hemisphere** and America has complete domination over its own neighborhood. You know, **Venezuela** is the 51st state, **Canada** is the 52nd state, you know, go down the list. But that potentially also leaves room for **China** to take **Taiwan**, for **Russia** to obviously they are going to get a large amount of land out of whatever final arrangement happens in in this war. It'll be interesting to see how that evolves and obviously the center of that conversation is **Donald Trump's** relationship with **Xi Jinping** and **Vladimir Putin** and what concessions he makes to them, how much room he gives them to exert their own domination over their neighborhoods.

**Michael Bubaro**: 好的。所以，把敌人关进监狱，重组整个**全球秩序**。**Charlie**，你对这里可能发生的事情还有什么要补充的吗？再补充一点，我想指出**移民执法**是一项尚未完成但已经升级的任务。**特朗普**很快就设法关闭了边境。但他的承诺、他的支持者选举他上任的目的以及他现在正在尽其所能积极推行的是**内部执法**。大规模搜捕旨在清除国内数百万没有证件的人。正如我们现在在**明尼阿波利斯**等地看到的那样。

**Michael Bubaro**: Okay. So, putting enemies behind bars, reorganizing the entire **global order**. **Charlie**, do you have anything to add to what you think might happen here? To add one more thing to the table, I would point to **immigration enforcement** as an unfinished business that is already becoming escalatory. **Trump** very quickly managed to close the border. But what has marked both his promises and what his base elected him to do and what he's now doing as aggressively as he can is the **interior enforcement**. Mass sweeps aimed at purging the country of many millions of people who are here without documentation. As we are seeing in places right now like **Minneapolis**.

</details>

**Charlie Savage**: 但底线是，这里有数百万人是像**史蒂文·米勒**这样的人不希望他们在这里的，找到他们并将他们拘留，然后以一种显著增加每年被驱逐出境人数的方式，推动他们通过**驱逐出境听证程序**，这是一项仍被承诺但尚未完成的成就。所以所有这一切似乎都意味着国内紧张局势的加剧，以及在**美国城市**街头，特别是**民主党城市**，使用硬实力和使用硬实力的意愿，包括戴着面具的**ICE**特工，行动非常激进，然后以联邦军队在**美国城市**街头保护和加强这项努力的威胁和有时是现实为后盾。这看起来非常煽动性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Charlie Savage**: But the bottom line is there are millions of people here that people like **Steven Miller** do not want to be here and finding them and taking them into custody and pushing them through the **deportation hearing process** in a way that dramatically escalates the number of people per year who are removed from the country is a achievement that it remains promised and yet undone. So what all this seems to add up to is an increased amount of tensions at home and the use and the willingness to use hard power in the streets of **American cities**, especially **Democratic cities**, both **ICE** agents in masks, acting very aggressively and then backed by the threat of and sometimes the reality of federal troops in the streets of **American cities** to protect and enhance that effort. It seems very incendiary.

**Michael Bubaro**: 对吧？是的，我的意思是，我们现在坐在这里，感觉国家确实处于边缘。我们正处于一个非常不稳定的时刻，**唐纳德·特朗普**正在主张权力，以一种非常直接的方式在城市中使用军队，使用**ICE**，而左翼正在建立一个抵抗运动。感觉这种冲突是不可避免的，而且比我们目前所看到的更具戏剧性。好的，**Jonathan**、**Charlie**、**Maggie**，再次非常感谢你们。非常感谢。

**Michael Bubaro**: Right? Yeah, I mean, as we sit here right now, it really does feel like the country is on edge. We're in this very precarious moment where you've got **Donald Trump's** assertion of power using the military, using **ICE** in cities in a very in-your-face way and a resistance movement that is building up steam on the left. And it just seems like that collision is inevitable in a way that is much more dramatic than we've seen so far. Well, **Jonathan**, **Charlie**, **Maggie**, thank you very much once again. Appreciate it.

**Michael Bubaro**: 周末，**特朗普总统**再次以以前难以想象的方式行使了他的权力。他的**司法部**对**明尼苏达州**的民主党领导人展开了刑事调查，包括该州州长**蒂姆·沃尔兹**和**明尼阿波利斯**市长**雅各布·弗莱**。两人都曾批评**特朗普**在该州的移民打击行动。调查将集中在指控这两名官员合谋阻止联邦移民官员履行职责。在一份声明中，**沃尔兹州长**称这项调查是“危险的**威权主义**策略”。我们马上回来。

**Michael Bubaro**: Over the weekend, **President Trump** once again used his power in previously unimaginable ways. His **justice department** opened a criminal investigation into **Minnesota's** Democratic leaders, including the state's governor, **Tim Walls**, and the mayor of **Minneapolis**, **Jacob Fry**. Both of whom have criticized **Trump's** immigration crackdown in the state. The investigation will focus on allegations that both officials conspired to block federal immigration officials from doing their job. In a statement, **Governor Walls** called the investigation a quote dangerous authoritarian tactic. We'll be right back.

**Michael Bubaro**: 还有今天你需要知道的其他事情。周末，**特朗普总统**在社交媒体上发帖威胁要对反对他收购**格陵兰岛**计划的欧洲国家征收新的高额关税。这引起了欧洲领导人的愤怒，他们表示这些威胁无异于对长期盟友发动**经济战**。但**特朗普**没有表现出丝毫退缩的迹象。周日，在一个令人振奋的坦率时刻，**特朗普**告诉**挪威**领导人，他不再觉得有义务和平接管**格陵兰岛**，因为他说他对没有赢得**诺贝尔和平奖**感到不满。**西班牙**官员正在调查一起高速列车事故的原因，该事故造成至少40人死亡。这是**西班牙**十多年来最致命的铁路事故。事故发生时，一列火车的两节尾车脱轨并驶入另一列火车的路径。由此造成的碰撞将一些乘客从火车上抛出数百英尺。

**Michael Bubaro**: Here's what else you need to know today. Over the weekend, **President Trump** threatened in a social media post to slap major new tariffs on European countries that oppose his plan to acquire **Greenland**. That drew outrage from European leaders who said the threats amounted to **economic warfare** against longtime allies. But **Trump** showed little sign of backing down. On Sunday, in a moment of bracing candor, **Trump** told the leader of **Norway** that he no longer felt any obligation to pursue a peaceful takeover of **Greenland** because he said he was upset about not winning the **Nobel Peace Prize**. And **Spanish** officials are investigating the cause of a high-speed train crash that killed at least 40 people. It was **Spain's** deadliest railroad accident in more than a decade. The crash occurred when the two rear cars of one train derailed and crossed into the path of another train. The resulting collision hurled some passengers hundreds of feet from the train.
