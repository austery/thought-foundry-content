title: 重新定义友谊：超越传统界限的深层联结
summary: 本次访谈中，记者兼作家**Rhaina Cohen**探讨了其著作《**The Other Significant Others**》的核心理念，呼吁拓宽对友谊的理解。她指出，社会常将友谊视为次要、私密且无需承诺的关系，限制了其在生活中的潜力。通过历史回顾与现代案例，Cohen强调了深层柏拉图式伙伴关系的重要性，并探讨了如何通过增加相处时间、分享脆弱性以及在法律和职场层面提供支持来培养这些关系。她还讨论了技术对友谊的复杂影响，以及如何应对孤独感，鼓励人们创造自己的“选择性家庭”和节日传统。

### 友谊的价值与限制

**主持人**: 对于我们许多人来说，这是一个让我们更加关注家庭问题的时刻。我们和谁团聚？谁支持我们？我们选择谁？谁又选择了我们？对一些人来说，这些答案可能非常清晰，但对另一些人来说，这可能带有一丝敏感，或者觉得你的答案与传统所期望的并不完全一致。这就是为什么我们今天的嘉宾现在显得尤为重要。她是一位记者，也是《**The Other Significant Others**》一书的作者。去年，她发表了一场**TED**演讲，鼓励我们拓宽对“我们的人”的定义，并认识到那些不总是能整齐地出现在节日贺卡或家谱上，但却能深刻影响我们生活的深层、持久的联结。我非常感谢她来到这里，帮助我们反思归属感、联结以及那些能伴我们度过这个季节乃至更久远的关系。请欢迎**Rhaina Cohen**。

**主持人**: For a lot of us, this is a moment when questions of family come into sharper focus. Who do we gather with? Who supports us? Who do we choose? And who chooses us? And for some of us, those answers might feel wonderfully clear, but for others, there might be a tenderness around this or a sense that your answers aren't quite what tradition tells you they should be. And that's why our guest today feels especially essential right now. She's a journalist and author of the other significant others. And last year, she delivered a TED talk that pushed us to expand who we count as our people and to recognize the deep sustaining connections that don't always fit neatly onto holiday cards or family trees, but can shape our lives in very profound ways. I'm so grateful she's here to help us reflect on belonging, connection, and relationships that can carry us into this season and well beyond it. Please give a welcome to **Raina Cohen**.

**Rhaina Cohen**: 真是个不错的介绍。谢谢，**Whitney**。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rhaina Cohen**: What a nice intro. Thanks, **Whitney**.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的，我想就此开始。你的演讲，你在**TED**舞台上发表的演讲，是你著作《**The Other Significant Others**》中核心思想的精髓，它本质上主张对友谊采取更广阔的视角，以及友谊能为我们所有人发挥的作用。引用书中的一句话，你说：“如果我们不限制友谊，它就能成为我们生活的核心。”那么，对于不熟悉的朋友，作为我们对话的入门，你对此有何看法？我们是如何限制友谊的？我们又该如何更全面地看待它？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Well, I think just maybe to kick things off, your your talk, the talk that you delivered on the TED stage is is sort of a distillation of the big idea from your book, **The Other Significant Others**, that essentially argues for a more expansive approach to friendship and the role it can play for all of us. And to pull a quote from the book, you say, "If we don't limit friendship, it can be central to our lives." So, for those of us who aren't familiar, as a a primer, I think for our conversation, what do you what do you mean by this? How are we limiting friendship? And how could we think about it more fully?

</details>

**Rhaina Cohen**: 我认为我们限制友谊，是因为我们觉得它能做到的比实际要少。其中一个非常明显的例子是，我们可以回顾不同时代和不同地方，看看那时的友谊是什么样子。它曾经是不同的。首先，我认为现在的期望是友谊是一种私密的关系。它只存在于你和另一个人之间，或者可能是一小群人之间，它是你生活的一个美好补充，但不是你生活的必需部分。你可以把它暂时搁置，但在许多其他地方，情况并非如此。我的意思是，你可以看到，过去有一些仪式是围绕着认可友谊而建立的，这种认可可能会持续你的一生。这种仪式的一个例子叫做**结拜兄弟**。它被认为是一种人们会见证的承诺。我们现在不认为友谊涉及承诺，更不用说在他人面前正式承诺了。所以，我认为即使是“承诺”这个概念也会让很多人感到惊讶。然后，我认为我们认为在友谊中可能体验到的情感种类也受到了限制。我们把浪漫关系视为唯一可以体验兴奋和迷恋的关系，那种心潮澎湃的感觉，而实际上朋友之间也可以体验到。我可以谈谈我自己的经历，这部分原因也促使我写了这本书。但同样，如果你回顾不同的时代和地方，你会看到那种朋友之间会谈论彼此相爱的感情，那是显而易见的，你会爱你的朋友。我认为，尤其是在我们谈论社会中的某些特定群体时，用“爱”这种语言来谈论，或者依偎在朋友身边而不被质疑是否涉及浪漫关系，并不常见。所以，我认为友谊是私密的、应该轻松的、不一定涉及承诺，以及情感体验的强度存在上限——所有这些都是我们低估友谊能为我们的生活带来什么和做什么的方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rhaina Cohen**: I think we limit friendship by thinking it can do less than it actually can. And one of the ways that feels really clear is by looking across time and across places and seeing what friendship looked like in those times and places. And it was different. For one thing, I think the expectation now is that friendship is going to be a relationship that's private. It's just between you and someone else or maybe it's a small group of people and it is a a nice addition to your life but it is not an essential part of your life. It's something that you can you know maybe put on the back burner and that was just not true in in many other places. I mean you you can see that there were rituals that were built around recognizing friendship potentially for the rest of your life. There an example of this ritual is called **sworn brotherhood**. And it was recognized as something that people would would witness like that that commitment. We don't think about friendship as involving commitment let alone a commitment that you are going to formalize in front of other people. So I think even the idea of commitment is something that would surprise a lot of people. And then I think the kinds of feelings that we think are possible to experience in friendship are also kind of limited. That we hold out romantic relationships as the relationship where you can experience excitement and infatuation.

um and the you know the sort of fluttery feelings that actually friends can experience. I can you know can talk about my own experience with this. It's partly what what led me to write the book. Um but again if you look across different times and and places you will see that kind of affection where friends um would talk about loving each other and that's that was obvious that you would love your friends and I think um especially you know we're talking about certain subsets of society it's not that common to talk in that language of love or to snuggle up to your friend without that being a question of you know are you romantically involved. So I think between the idea that friendship is private, that it doesn't it should be easy, it shouldn't necessarily involve commitment, um and that there are there's kind of a cap on how intense the emotional experience might be. All of those are ways that we I think underestimate what friendship can can be and do for our lives.

### 个人经历与“柏拉图式伙伴关系”

**主持人**: 你刚才提到你对此有某种个人联结。你能多谈谈你为什么写这本书，以及最终发表那场演讲吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And you you mentioned just now that you have sort of a personal connection to this. Can you tell us a little bit more about why you wrote the book and and and then ultimately gave the talk? So, I

</details>

**Rhaina Cohen**: 我发现自己陷入了一段友谊，它彻底打破了我对友谊的固有定义。这发生在我二十出头的时候，我遇到了一位朋友，结果她就住在离我步行五分钟的地方。我们的生活比我之前经历的任何关系都更加紧密地交织在一起。我以前可能经历过一些类似的关系，但我们发现即使是“最好的朋友”这个词也感觉不够充分，好像“伴侣”这个词更适合。我开始思考我生命中不同时期认识的其他人，他们也有这种非常强烈、忠诚的友谊，但这些友谊无法用“朋友”或“最好的朋友”来形容。然后我回顾了历史，也就是我之前谈到的一些内容，我意识到我们现在对友谊有一个非常具体的想法。我希望找到今天拥有这种友谊的人。在这些采访过程中，我意识到这不仅仅是一个旨在提升并帮助人们认识到存在这种我称之为**柏拉图式伙伴关系**的极度亲密友谊的项目，而且因为它们通过融合伙伴关系和柏拉图式友谊的元素，挑战了友谊的定义，所以它们最终引出了所有这些更大的问题：我们如何知道一段浪漫关系是浪漫的？为什么浪漫关系默认情况下比友谊更受重视？我们如何定义家庭？国家如何定义重要的关系？所以基本上，它始于我的个人经历，但所有这些更大的问题都浮现在我脑海中，我希望在一本书中探讨它们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rhaina Cohen**: found myself in a friendship that really broke the definition of friendship that I thought was, you know, what it was supposed to be. And, uh, this happened in my early 20s and I ended up meeting a friend who, it turned out lived 5 minutes uh, a five-minute walk away from me. And we became much more intertwined in each other's lives uh, than I had ex I had experienced maybe something somewhat comparable. um a couple of times, but we found ourselves struggling with even the language of best friend that that felt inadequate that something more like partners maybe fit. And I found myself thinking about other people that I had known at different points in my life who had these really intense, devoted friendships that didn't kind of um couldn't be captured with the term friend or best friend. And then I looked to history, some of what I was just talking about before, and realized that we have a really specific idea about what friendship is now. And I wanted to find people today who had these kinds of friendships. And essentially over the course of those interviews, I realized that this wasn't just a project to lift up and help people recognize that there were these extremely close friendships that I called **Platonic partnerships**, but that because they they challenged the definition of friendship by blending together kinds of elements of partnership and platonic friendship that they ended up asking all these bigger questions about how do we, you know, know that a that a romantic relationship is romantic? Why are romantic relationships held up higher than friendships by default? Like how do we define what family is? How does the state define what an important relationship is? So basically like it started from this personal place, but all these bigger questions came up for me that I wanted to tackle in a book.

</details>

**主持人**: 我认为非常重要的一点是，这并不是在反对浪漫关系。你并不是说你只能选择其中一种，对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And and I think it's really important to note that this this isn't an argument against romantic relationships. You're not suggesting that you have either or, right?

</details>

**Rhaina Cohen**: 不，绝对不是。我的意思是，我尝试在很多方面非常小心地说明这并非非此即彼。我认为，那将是使用我试图反对的相同逻辑——即只有一种正确的生活方式。我认为目前我们得到的信息是，正确的生活方式是找到一个浪漫伴侣，也许生孩子，不孤单。我不想说那种唯一正确的方式是错误的，但我发现了另一种正确的方式。我认为更大的重点是，有多种方式可以过上意义深远的生活，而围绕友谊、许多友谊或某种其他组合来构建你的生活，可能非常重要。事实上，我在书中介绍了一些人，他们既有浪漫伴侣，也有这种非常亲密的友谊。我探讨了这些不同类型的关系如何实际上可以相互补充。例如，拥有这样一种非常亲密的友谊可以使浪漫关系更牢固。所以，我绝不认为这是一种非此即彼的选择。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rhaina Cohen**: No. Absolutely not. I mean, I I uh I try to be really careful in in a number of ways to say that it's not either or. I think um that would be kind of using the same logic that I am trying to push against the idea that there's one right way to live. Um I think currently the message we get is that the right way to live is to find a romantic partner, maybe have kids, um you know, to not be alone. And I don't want to say that there's that that's that one right way is wrong, but I have found the other one right way. I think the the bigger point is that there are a variety of ways to live deeply meaningful lives and that building your life around a friendship or many friendships or some other kind of combo of things um can be really important. Um and in fact there are people who I profile in the book who have both a romantic partner and this really close friendship. Um, and I explore the ways that those those different types of relationships can actually complement each other. Like it can make a romantic relationship stronger to have a really close friendship like this in your life. So, I definitely don't see it as either or.

### 拓宽友谊的益处

**主持人**: 听了你研究的所有事情和你遇到过的所有人，感觉你拥有一个关于如何将友谊视为一种主要甚至基础性关系的宝贵经验宝库。我很好奇，当我们将友谊的限制移除，它能如何发挥作用，以及你看到人们的生活因此如何改善，你对此学到了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Hearing all of the things that you've researched and all the people you've encountered, it's it's it feels like you have just sort of this treasure trove of learnings and how you can think about friendship as sort of a primary maybe even foundational relationship. And I'm curious to hear what you've learned um about what can become possible for people when we do remove the limits from friendship and how it can function and how have you seen people's lives improve um as a result of doing this?

</details>

**Rhaina Cohen**: 我采访了几十个人，从中得到了一个非常重要的教训，那就是生活总是充满意外。如果你只被告知一种可能的生活方式和幸福方式，那么面对所有可能出现的问题，它就显得不够有韧性，这些问题包括想找浪漫伴侣却找不到，或者找到了浪漫伴侣却分手了，或者生了一个有严重残疾的孩子。我的意思是，我看到人们挣扎于各种各样的事情，而让他们能够过上真正充实的生活的原因是，他们对朋友能够提供支持、在事情出错时提供支持的可能性持开放态度。例如，我写过一位患卵巢癌去世的女性，她的朋友是她的主要照护者。她的丈夫当时无法提供帮助，尤其是在照顾孩子方面。这就像拥有一个更广阔的安全网，无论遇到紧急情况，还是生活没有完全按照你预期的轨道发展，这都是一个寻找意义的好方法。即使对于那些生活没有发生他们不愿选择的转变的人，拥有深厚的友谊也真的很有益，因为这意味着他们生命中不止一个人能发掘出他们不同的一面。我想到我的一位朋友，和她在一起我总是开怀大笑。我曾让她和另一位朋友一起出去玩，我意识到那位能激发出我沉思一面的朋友，可能从未见过我笑得那么开心。所以，我认为对“你生命中会有不止一段真正重要的关系”这个想法持开放态度，意味着你有人帮助你发现更完整、更全面的自我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rhaina Cohen**: A really big lesson I got um interviewing many dozens of people was that life takes you by surprise. And if you only have one one way that you are told is possible to live live your life and to be happy, it's just not that resilient to all of the things that can come up which range from wanting a romantic partner and not being able to find one to having a romantic partner and splitting up uh to having a kid with serious disabilities. Um, I mean there's sort of any number of things that I saw people struggle with and what made them be able to move into a life that felt really full to them was being open to the possibility that a friend could could be there, could be the backs stop when things went wrong. Um, you know, one I mean I write about women a woman who was dying of ovarian cancer and her friend was really her **primary caretaker**. um and you know her husband was not kind of in the position to help especially with the kids. It's like having um a wider safety net when uh whether it's something that's acute or is just like your life didn't quite fit on the train tracks you expected. Uh it it's just this this great way to um to still find a lot of meaning. And even for people whose lives don't take um a turn that maybe they wouldn't have chosen really benefit from having deep friendships um because they it means that they have more than one person in their life who can unlock a different side of them. I mean I think about one of my friends who I'm just constantly laughing around. Um, and I had had her and another friend like hang out and I realized that one of my friends who brings out this really contemplative side of me had probably never seen me laugh as much I as I had then. So, I think also being open to the idea that you're going to have um more than one really significant relationship in your life means that you have people who help you kind of figure out the like fuller well-rounded version of yourself.

### 友谊的障碍与培养方法

**主持人**: 如今，关于成年人在不同人生阶段（比如搬家、结婚或生孩子）维系牢固的柏拉图式关系所面临的挑战，已经有很多文章。我个人也经历过一些这样的挑战，随着年龄增长。你认为发展这类关系的最大障碍是什么？你建议人们如何克服它们？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You know, I think there's been so much written these days about the challenges adults face and maintaining strong relationships, platonic relationships across different life events. You know, whether that's relocation or marriage or children and uh and I I personally know that I've experienced some of these challenges as I've gotten older. What do you see as some of the biggest barriers to developing these types of relationships and and how do you recommend people overcome them?

</details>

**Rhaina Cohen**: 嗯，回答这个问题的一种方式是思考蓬勃发展的友谊的要素，或者说个体友谊的要素，这可能也适用于社区。我采访过一位来自**犹他大学**的研究员，她说任何亲密关系（她谈论的是依恋关系）的三个神奇要素是：时间、亲密感和身体接触。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rhaina Cohen**: Well, one way to answer that is to think about what are the ingredients of a thriving friendship or thrive I mean individual friendships and this probably also applies to community and a research I talked to from um the **University of Utah** said that the three magic ingredients of she was talking about attachment so like any kind of close relationship were time togetherness and touch

</details>

**Rhaina Cohen**: 所以，如果我们从那里反推，就会想到：我们能花多少时间与他人相处？如果我们住得离朋友或潜在朋友很远，如果我们优先考虑拥有一个可以独享的房子，或者存在负担能力问题，例如，当我们试图决定住在哪里时，这会减少我们拥有的时间。如果我们一直在工作，情况也一样。亲密感也关乎共同分享生活。如果我们倾向于一起度过时间的方式（因为这是常态）是去喝咖啡或进行某项活动，而不是让人们融入我们的日常生活，因为那会很无聊或不合适，例如一起跑腿办事，那也可能成为障碍。而且，如果你认为所有重要的活动都应该和浪漫伴侣一起做，而不是朋友，那对友谊来说也可能很困难。第三点是身体接触。我们当然有关于与朋友亲近程度的规范。正如我之前提到的，我认为直男在这方面首当其冲地承受这种影响，这就是为什么你会看到侧身拥抱，而不是全身拥抱，或者握手。我采访过一位男士说，他的父亲甚至不会坐在他旁边，他必须留出空间，他所有的朋友在遇到他这位朋友之前也都是这样。所以，我认为围绕身体接触的那些障碍、身体接触的规范也可能成为阻碍。还有很多其他因素，我认为都指向“友谊应该是轻松的”这种观念。我们不应该感到不便或给他人带来不便。我认为这些都是阻碍我们变得更亲密的几个障碍。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rhaina Cohen**: so if we work backwards from there it's like How um how much time are we able to spend with other people? Well, if we live far from our friends or potential friends, if the priority we have is having a house that, you know, we can keep to ourselves or there are problems with affordability, for instance, um when we're trying to to figure out where to live, uh that's going to reduce the amount of time we have. Same thing for if we're working all the time. Um togetherness is um also about like just sharing life together. And if the way that we are maybe inclined to um spend time together because this is what's normal is to like go get coffee or do an activity and um and not just let people into our everyday lives because that would be uh you know like going and doing errands for instance um because that would be boring or not appropriate. that also can be a barrier. Um, and uh, and as well as if you think you're supposed to be kind of um, doing any activity of significance with your with a romantic partner um, as opposed to a friend, that can can be difficult uh, for friendship. And then the third thing would be is touch. You know, there's certainly norms that we have around how close you can get to your friends. Um, as I, you know, mentioned before, I think, um, straight men really bear the brunt of this, that, uh, this is why you see the side hugs and, uh, as opposed to like a full-on hug or, you know, see handshakes or one, um, one man I interviewed said that his his father won't even sit next to him right next to him on the couch. He has to leave space and all of his friends would do the same um, before he sort of had this other friendship. Um, so I think the the kind of um those sorts of uh barriers around touch, norms of touch um can also get in the way. Um, and there there are plenty of other things too that I think get at the idea that friendship is supposed to be easy. Um, that we shouldn't, you know, be inconvenienced or inconvenience others. Um, that those are a few of the I think the barriers that that come into um getting closer.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么，如果有人真的有兴趣培养比你所描述的友谊更深层次、更有意识的柏拉图式关系，你建议人们可以采取哪些步骤，在他们与现有朋友的生活中实践这一点？我们从这里开始。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: H. So, so then if someone were really interested in developing more intentional platonic relationships that are deeper than friendship as you're describing, what would be some of the steps you'd recommend people take to to practice this in their in their lives with existing friends? Let's start there.

</details>

**Rhaina Cohen**: 是的，我的意思是，首先是如何获得更多相处时间？有一件事听起来可能很简单，但真的很有帮助，那就是定期与朋友见面。我有一个朋友，她有两个年幼的孩子，非常被困在家里，她丈夫每周有一天有合唱团练习，每隔一周，我会在她孩子睡着后去她家，我们在她家聚会。这就像被纳入我们的日程，即使我们其中一人有事、旅行或其他情况，我们对彼此见面的频率都有一个预期。如果你只见过某人一次，没有立即制定计划，然后一两个月甚至三个月过去了，你可能会失去联系。另一种我做过的方法是，在你离开当前的互动之前，就计划好下次见面的时间。所以，如果你在吃晚饭，拿出你的日历，确定下次见面的时间。所以，这大概是我会推荐的一件事。我认为关于“可以向朋友提出什么要求或为朋友做什么”这个想法，我建议尝试更多地寻求帮助，或者至少在情绪低落时告诉别人，对生活中不那么完美的部分保持开放。这会邀请其他人也与你分享这些事情。我见过这在我自己的生活中发生，分享脆弱的事情会成为一种邀请，然后这会形成一个飞轮效应，让你们更亲近。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rhaina Cohen**: Yeah. I mean, one is how do you how do you get more time together? And uh one thing that might sound simple but uh is really helpful is having recurring ways to see friends. So, I have a friend who has two young children and is really bound um to her house and like there's a day of the week when her husband is um has choir practice and uh every other week I come by after her kids are in bed and we hang out at the house um and it's like built into our calendars and even if one of us is unavailable, traveling, whatever, um we have this expectation of how much we're going to see each other uh that I I think you can lose track of if you, you know, see somebody once, you don't make plans uh immediately and then then a month or two or three passes. Um, another way that I've I've done this is to plan the next time you're going to see the person before you leave your like the the existing interaction. So, if you're, you know, at dinner, um, get out your calendars and and figure out the next time. Um, so that that's sort of like one thing that I would recommend. Uh I think on this the idea of like what is acceptable to ask of a friend or do for a friend I I think trying to experiment with asking for help a little bit more or at least telling people when you're in a you're having you know a low mood being open about the parts of your life that are not polished. Uh it invites other people to then share those things with you. Uh I've, you know, I've seen this um play out with people in my my own life that uh sharing something that is vulnerable becomes an invitation and then that kind of uh is a flywheel that can bring you closer.

</details>

**Rhaina Cohen**: 然后我给出的最后一个建议是一个更激进的建议，但也许值得考虑。一方面，我真的相信我们应该更认真地对待友谊。我们不应该在遇到第一个困难时就退缩。我们应该尝试进行更艰难的对话，并有意识地去经营。但另一方面，我认为我们有时会让友谊变得比实际更困难，因为我们许多人将生活重心放在了不同的优先事项上，例如你可能想拥有自己的一切，你想要一个自己能掌控的家，或者你决定住在离工作尽可能近的地方，或者其他任何优先事项，然后我们接受了我们会因此经历一些社交匮乏。我不是说我们真的接受了，我甚至不确定人们是否意识到，当我们为了这些其他价值观而构建生活时，我们承受着巨大的损失。我发现，根据我的经验以及我采访过的其他人，如果他们把生活安排在朋友们身体上近在咫尺的地方，那么维系这些友谊就会容易得多。对于那些时间紧迫、被困在家里的人尤其如此，比如有年幼的孩子，或者需要照顾生活中的亲戚，有邻居在隔壁，或者在街区尽头，或者只是非常近，这决定了能否与他人建立亲密关系。所以，我知道这可能需要一些努力，我们可以谈谈这个。但这正是我认为更激进的建议，即你在前期做好功课，从长远来看，友谊会变得更容易。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rhaina Cohen**: Uh and then the last suggestion I'll give is a more radical one. Um but maybe something to consider. Uh I on the one hand I really believe in the idea that we should take friendship more seriously. We shouldn't run away at the first difficulty. We should try to have um you know harder conversations um and make be intentional. But on the other hand, I think that there are ways that we we make friendship harder than it needs to be because we have oriented so many of us our lives around a different set of priorities which might be as you know the the idea that like you want to have everything to yourself. you want to have a home that you have control over or you make a decision about where to live so that it's as close to work as possible or um you know any any number of other kinds of uh priorities and then we accept that uh we're just going to have some social deprivation as part of it. I don't think that's actually I say accept but I'm not sure that people are even conscious of it that there's this this huge um loss that we incur when we um build our lives uh for some of these other values and I have found that um in my experience and and in other people that I've interviewed if they situate their lives so that they it's built around friends physically close by their to their friends it makes it so much easier to maintain those friendships. And that is especially true for people who are really timestrapped um and like bound to the home like if they have young children or if they have to caretake for you know a relative in their life that having somebody next door um or down the block or you know just very close by it can um make or break the ability to get close to other people. So um I know that that can take some work and we can talk about that. Um, but that's the more radical suggestion that I think you're doing work on the front end that makes friendship easier in the longer run.

### 建立新友谊的策略

**主持人**: 你分享了很多关于如何加深与生活中已有朋友的关系的建议。那么，对于那些有兴趣结识新朋友并希望发展更深层次关系的人，你有什么建议吗？你如何处理这类关系？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Well, you know what you've shared is a lot around people that maybe are already in your life in some capacity and you see some opportunity to deepen the relationship. How what are some tips you would suggest for people who are interested in in meeting people with the hopes that it could turn into something more? How do you approach those sorts of relationships?

</details>

**Rhaina Cohen**: 是的，我的意思是，这大概有几个步骤。首先是寻找过程。你如何找到你可能想成为朋友的人？然后是，你找到了你想成为朋友的人或一群人。你如何让他们成为朋友？然后是，一旦你们成为普通朋友，如何才能变得真正亲密？我最近参加了一个派对，我觉得它是一个非常有趣的例子，解决了第一个寻找问题。我有一些朋友意识到他们想扩大社交圈，因为他们去参加派对时，所有朋友都彼此认识。所以他们被困在这个圈子里。他们举办了一个派对，他们称之为“**三度人脉派对**”，就像“六度分隔理论”或凯文·贝肯游戏那样。规则是，如果你被邀请了，你需要带一个主人不认识的朋友。那是第二度。然后那个人也应该带一个第一个客人不认识的朋友。那是第三度。这意味着派对上三分之二的人是主人不认识的。而且因为每个人都有一定距离，所以你更有可能遇到新朋友。所以我认为这是一个非常有趣的方式，可以让你遇到新朋友。或者你可以在一个有八个人的晚宴上做类似的事情，此外还有所有那些人们会建议的标准做法，因为它们很有道理，比如参加某种以社区为导向的活动。对我来说，那是**摇摆舞**。它也可以是一个宗教社区，总之是一个人们会聚集在一起的地方，你会不断地见到他们，然后不可避免地你会因为不断见到他们而搭讪聊天。所以这是解决寻找问题的一种方法。然后，关于如何让你找到的人成为朋友？我建议尝试主动出击。这在友谊中可能很困难，因为我认为我们不像在浪漫关系中那样，对被拒绝有预期，我们理解在浪漫关系中需要承担一定的风险，主动示好。但柏拉图式关系也是如此，主动示好却被拒绝是很糟糕的，比如邀请某人共进晚餐、喝咖啡或参加活动。但我认为，尝试鼓起勇气主动出击，因为否则可能会有很多人都想认识彼此，但每个人都有一点害怕。然后第三件事是，如何提升友谊的深度？我认为我建议的定期聚会是一种方法。我有时会非常直接地告诉别人，我对他们有“友情上的迷恋”，或者说，我早些时候搬到华盛顿特区（我住的地方）时，我决定专注于结交几个真正亲密的朋友，而不是一个更广阔的圈子，而她就是其中之一，我认为这彻底改变了我们的友谊。我们不住在同一个地方，但去年我主持了她的婚礼。我认为真正明确地表达我非常看重她，并且我真的很想了解她，这让我们更容易更快地亲近，并比我们原本可能花更多时间在一起。我突然意识到，直接说出来在这里起到了多么大的作用，这可能我们在浪漫关系中会这样做，但在其他关系中却不会。如果有人对我这样说，我就会立即明白你对这段关系的重视程度，这感觉是一种简单而深刻的思考方式。

**Rhaina Cohen**: Yeah, I I mean there are kind of a few steps there. So, one is like the search process. How do you find people who you might potentially want to become friends with? And then there's okay, you found somebody who you want to be friends with or a group of people. How do you make them how do you like end up becoming friends? And then it's once you become casual friends, how do you become really close? Um I I recently uh went to a party that I felt like was a very interesting uh example of a of a way to solve that first search problem. So there were a few of my friends who were um had kind of realized that they wanted to widen their social circle because they would go to a party and like all their friends were friends with each other. So they were like locked in this circle together. And they held a party that they called **three degrees** like the six degrees of or whatever. **six degrees of separation** with the **Kevin Bacon** thing. And um the the uh rules were if you were invited, you were asked to bring one friend that the hosts didn't know. So that was the second degree. And then that person was also supposed to bring a friend that the first guest didn't know. So that's the third degree. And it meant that twothirds of the party were people that the host didn't know. And also because everyone was kind of at a there were a lot of people at a remove um it made it uh more likely that you're going to meet new people. Uh so that's a way I thought was really interesting for um how you can encounter new people. Um or you could do a version of that I think at a dinner party with eight people in addition to like all the all the sort of standard things that people will um advise because they make sense like uh going to do some sort of activity that that is oriented around community. Like for me that's **swing dance**. Um it could be a religious community, something where there is a place where people are going to be and you're going to keep seeing them and inevitably you'll strike up conversation because you keep seeing them. So that's kind of one way to deal with the search issue. And then in terms of how do you make friends from people that you find? Uh I I would recommend trying to make the first move. Uh and this can be difficult in friendship because I don't think we have the expectation of rejection in the way that it's really built into by contrast romantic relationships that we understand that there's some amount of risk-taking putting yourself out there and romantic relationships. But the same goes for **platonic relationships** and it sucks to make a bid and have it rejected um you know to invite someone to dinner or coffee or an activity. But um I think uh trying to embolden yourself to make the first move uh because otherwise there will be people who all maybe want to get to know each other but everybody's a little bit afraid. Um and then the third thing is like how do you escalate the friendship? And I think that doing the kind of recurring hangouts that I suggested is is one way. Um I've sometimes been really explicit with people and told them I have a **friend crush** on them or that you know um earlier when I moved to DC where where I live I had decide I like told a friend I'm you know deciding to focus on like making a few really close friends as opposed to a wider circle and that she was one of those people and that ended up I think pretty much transforming our friendship. um we don't live in the same place, but uh I you know officiated her wedding this this past year. And I think that really articulating that I had that um I so thought so highly of her and I really wanted to get to know her um made it easier for us to get closer faster and like spend more time together than we might have otherwise. Mhm. It it it strikes me how much of a role like just saying the thing really helps here in in a way that maybe we we do this in romantic relationships and not in others. Like I if someone were to say something like that to me, it would become immediately obvious how strongly you feel about that relationship and that feels like such a simple but profound way to to think about this.

### 面对面交流的重要性

**主持人**: 嗯，我们收到了很多成员关于面对面交流重要性的问题。例如，**Valerie C**问，你能不能多谈谈关于真实联结的研究，即面对面体验与虚拟体验的重要性？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Um well we have a lot of questions from members about the important role of physically being in in in front of a person plays here. So **Valerie C** for instance asks um if you could tell us more about the research around how important authentic connection is um when you're an in-person having it be an in-person experience versus something that's virtual.

</details>

**Rhaina Cohen**: 嗯，你知道，我并没有过多关注虚拟联结这部分。所以我没有具体的引用对象，除了我之前提到的，亲密关系和依恋关系的关键要素确实涉及身体接触。当然，这会因人而异。但我会说，虽然你可以像我们现在这样通过虚拟方式与人联结，但有些事情是你通过发短信无法察觉到的。举个例子，我有一个朋友，我和她住在一起，她当时正在经历一些非常困难的事情。家里有人问她怎么样，她无法假装没事。她无法决定，你知道，如果有人通过短信问她，她可能不会立即回复，或者敷衍过去。但当你与人面对面时，有肢体语言，有表情，我认为尤其是在发生一些比较困难的事情时，你会察觉到这些，同时也能更好地了解对方。你知道，我想到我的一位朋友，她会紧张不安，不停地抖腿，这对我来说就是一个信号，表明她感到特别焦虑，观察到这一点帮助我了解了她其他方面的事情。所以，虽然我认为能够通过各种在线平台、短信和语音聊天与世界各地的人联结是非常棒的，但我认为它们不能完全替代你了解他人的方式，以及你关心他们的方式，比如给一个拥抱，或者真正亲身在场意味着什么。我认为，至少在某个时候，你需要一些面对面的互动才能真正亲近。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rhaina Cohen**: Um I you know I didn't end up focusing that much on the kind of virtual uh connection piece. So I don't um I don't have like specific people to site other than what I was mentioning before around you know one of the key um key ingredients of and a a very close relationship and attachment relationship does involve physical touch. Um and obviously there's going to be variation across people. Um so I but you know I would say like there are ways that you can connect with people virtually as as we are doing now. But there are things that you don't pick up when uh you are texting with someone. Um as an example, I uh had a friend who um I I live with who um was going through something very difficult and some and someone in the house asked how she was doing and she could not fake it. she couldn't, you know, she couldn't decide to, if someone had asked her that by text, she might have not answered immediately or, you know, brushed it off. But when you are in person with with people, there's body language, there are there expressions um that I think especially if there's something that's kind of more difficult going on uh that you pick up on as well as just getting to know people better. uh you you know like I think of um a friend of mine who will just like she can get get jittery and like shake her leg a lot and that is a signal to me that she's feeling particularly anxious and um by observe like observing that helped me understand other things about her. So, um, while I do think it's it's really great to be able to connect with, um, people all around the world through different kinds of, um, online platforms, um, and and text and and voice chat, um, I I don't think that they are, uh, a total replacement for the, uh, the things that you learn about people and the ways you're able to care for them, like giving a hug or being really what it means to be physically present. um that it's uh you you need at least some inerson uh interaction I think at some point to to get really close.

### 社会结构对友谊的支持

**主持人**: 我很想在稍后的对话中更深入地探讨这一点，思考未来以及我们前进的方向，但现在我们还是回到如何培养这些关系的话题。关于对这种关系的支持，亲人或家庭成员可以做些什么来支持那些决定加深柏拉图式关系的人？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And I'd love to dive into this a little bit more later later in the conversation just sort of thinking about the the future and sort of where we're headed but um sort of sticking in this space of how to to cultivate these relationships. um thinking about support for this, how what can loved ones or family members do um to support people who have decided to deepen a platonic relationship?

</details>

**Rhaina Cohen**: 我认为有一点是，要带着好奇而非评判的态度。我看到那些拥有**柏拉图式伙伴关系**的人真正挣扎的是他们所面临的持续误解，而且通常不仅仅是善意的误解，而是人们以一种污名化的方式对待他们的友谊。这可能包括说闲话。或者，你知道，我写过一位母亲，她就是不明白你怎么能和一个没有浪漫关系的人如此亲密，她坚信她儿子和他最好的朋友之间的友谊是一种浪漫关系。我的意思是，这很常见。所以，我认为不要带着“我期望你这样生活，你为什么不那样生活？”的态度。我理解这种友谊的唯一方式是它必须是浪漫的。或者告诉他们“你的优先事项搞错了”，这也是我听到过的一些说法。是的，那些说法都没有什么帮助。相反，应该问：“谁对你很重要？这个人为什么对你很重要？”带着这些开放式问题，尝试去了解这个人。像对待某人的新浪漫伴侣，或者一个亲戚那样对待他们，因为这个人对你关心的人来说真的很重要，因此推而广之，你也想关心他们。所以，我认为这是亲人可以提供支持的一种方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rhaina Cohen**: I think one thing is to come in from a place of curiosity rather than judgment. One thing that I saw people who had **platonic partnerships** really struggle with was the constant misunderstanding that they were up against and often not just sort of benign misunderstanding um but people who kind of stigma like treated their friendship in a way that was stigmatized. Um, and that could include gossiping. Um, or, you know, I write about a mother who is just like, I I don't understand how you can be so close to somebody who you're not romantically involved in and was convinced that the the friendship between two her son and her son's best friend was a romantic relationship. I mean, that's pretty common. Um, so I think coming in from not a place of like here's how I expect you to live your life. Why aren't you living your life that way? um the only way I can understand this friendship is if it is romantic. Um or or telling them like your priorities are messed up, which is also something I've heard. Um yeah, those are those are not very helpful. And instead being like who matters to you? Why does this person matter to you? like coming from a place of these open-ended questions and trying to get to know the person. Um, treating them as you would treat someone's new romantic partner or um, somebody that they or maybe a relative that um, it's somebody who will uh, who really matters to a person you care about and therefore by extension you want to care about them too. Um, so I think that that's that's one way um, loved ones can be supportive.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么我们周围的社会结构呢？你在演讲和书中都谈到了这一点。关于朋友在工作场所、社区和政府中获得支持的这个想法。我们需要哪些东西来为更广阔、更有意义的柏拉图式联结腾出空间，超越我们更广泛社区中的这些关系？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: H and what about the the structures around us? You you talk about this um in in the talk and a fair amount in the book. This idea of of of friends um being supported in the workplace or um in their communities and government. Uh what sort of things do we need um to make room for more expansive and meaningful platonic bonds um outside of of um of these relationships in our in our wider communities?

</details>

**Rhaina Cohen**: 我的意思是，我认为其基本原则是不要从僵化的立场出发，认为只有一两种关系是重要的，比如浪漫关系和家庭关系，而其他一切都不那么重要。我认为这适用于工作场所和政策制定。所以，你知道，这种情况通常发生在朋友生病或去世时，问题是工作场所会如何支持他们，或者不予支持，以及政策允许什么。我之前提到过一位女性，她照顾她患癌症去世的最好的朋友，她是主要照护者，但她的工作单位没有给她家庭病假。她的朋友去世时，她也没有资格获得丧假，因为这些福利仅限于家庭成员，而非朋友。有趣的是，如果这发生在现在，她所居住的**明尼苏达**州已经扩大了可以请这类假的人员定义。所以，它包括任何你认为亲近到可以视为家人的人，这可以是一种柏拉图式关系。所以，我认为工作场所和政策都可以这样做，以更广阔的视角来提供福利和权利给那些不属于血缘关系、收养家庭或婚姻范畴的人。然后，我探讨的另一个重要的政策领域与这样一个事实有关：在这个国家，我们真正只有婚姻才能作为权利和福利的来源。然而，在其他国家，以及美国过去的某些时期，曾有过**同居伴侣关系**之类的东西，允许没有浪漫关系的人能够将权利赋予另一个人。而现在发生的情况是，如果你想让你的朋友成为你财产的继承人，或者你希望他们拥有医疗或法律授权书的权利，这些事情你必须通过律师办理，这可能很昂贵，并且需要处理大量文书工作，而且在紧急时刻，比如在医院里，这些文件可能不被承认，因为这不是人们习惯的做法。他们习惯于与婚姻或家庭成员相关的身份，而不是朋友也可以很重要的想法。所以，我从不同的法律学者那里看到的一个建议是，提供婚姻的法律替代方案，比如你在车管所指定一个人，作为默认处理你生活中医疗和法律事务的人，这对于未婚人士尤其有帮助，但你也可以在其他情况下将权利赋予不同的人，这同样是你如果花很多钱并有能力通过律师办理各种合同才能做到的，但大多数人无法获得这种服务。它不像结婚证那样只需20或30美元。所以，如果国家能够承认非浪漫或非家庭性质的关系，那将是一个非常大的进步。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rhaina Cohen**: H and what about the the structures around us? You you talk about this um in in the talk and a fair amount in the book. This idea of of of friends um being supported in the workplace or um in their communities and government. Uh what sort of things do we need um to make room for more expansive and meaningful platonic bonds um outside of of um of these relationships in our in our wider communities? Mhm. I mean, I think the kind of underlying principle of not coming from a rigid place of this is there's one or two kinds of relationships that matter, you know, romantic and familial and everything else is less less important. Um, I think that that translates to workplaces and to policy. So uh you know one way this this tends to come up is when somebody uh when a friend is ill um or has passed away and the question is what will the workplace do to support them or not and also what does policy allow? So there was a a woman who uh I I mentioned earlier who took care of her best friend who was who was dying of cancer, was the main caregiver, and her workplace did not entitle her to **family medical leave**. Um um nor when her friend died was she entitled to **bereavement leave** because those were uh benefits that were restricted to if it was a family member or a friend. Um, interestingly, if this had happened now, the state she lives in, **Minnesota** would, um, has expanded the definition of kind of who, uh, counts as somebody that you can take this kind of leave for. So, it's anybody that you, you know, you're close enough to consider family, which can be a **platonic relationship**. Um so that's something that both I think workplaces and policy um can can do to uh be more expansive about how uh about providing benefits and rights to people who uh are outside of these the boxes of um kind of blood or adopted family um or uh marriage. And then the one other um kind of significant policy area that I explore uh has to do with the fact that we really only have marriage uh as a a source of of um rights and and benefits in this country. uh whereas in other other countries and also in other times in the US there have been um things like **domestic partnerships** um that would allow people who are not romantically involved to be able to sign rights to another person. Um and instead what ends up happening is that if you want to have your friend be your you know the heir to um uh the you know that the goods you have in your life or you want them to have medical or legal power of attorney rights. I mean, those are things that you have to do um by going to a lawyer, getting which can be expensive and going through a lot of paperwork um that u may or may not be recognized in the heat of the moment like in a hospital um because it's it's not something that uh people are used to. They they're used to this status that's associated with marriage or associated with being um a family member but not to uh the idea that a friend can be significant. So uh one thing that I saw from different legal scholars was the proposal to offer **legal alternatives to marriage** like that there you know when you go to the DMV you designate a person um who is the default person to handle medical and legal things in your life and that um and that would be especially helpful for people who aren't married but um you can also uh you know in other cases you would be able to assign rights to different people which again is something that you can do if you spend a lot of money and have the wherewithal to go through a lawyer for for different sorts of contracts, but that's not accessible to most people. It doesn't, you know, it's not like 20 or $30 in the way that a marriage license is. Um, so I it so having um a way that the state could uh recognize relationships that are not romantic or familial in nature would be a really big step.

### 友谊的商业价值与未来趋势

**主持人**: 好的，我们有一个来自**Carlos O.**的问题，这与此非常有趣地联系在一起：如果我们从相反的角度来看，你认为组织是否有商业理由来支持这类关系和联结？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Well, we have a question from **Carlos O**. uh which it's really interesting connected to this like so if we look at the opposite end of this do you think that there's a a business case for organizations to to do this to sort of pro to support uh these sorts of relationships and connections

</details>

**Rhaina Cohen**: 嗯，是的，这很有趣。我的意思是，我认为当人们的生活整体上感到充实时，他们会更满足。我知道也有研究表明，如果你特别考虑工作场所的友谊，那会影响员工留存率，如果员工在工作中感到与他人亲近。但如果你谈论的是工作之外的亲密友谊，例如有人生病了，我认为人们会对组织产生一种感激之情，因为他们被视为一个完整的人，而不仅仅是机器中的一个齿轮，而且只有在非常狭窄的例外情况下才不允许工作。我认为人们对此反应非常好，这与组织内部的各种兴趣小组，或者人们对提供高质量家庭福利的工作场所的忠诚度是一致的，因为他们认为这能更好地让他们体验整个生活，而不是觉得他们在工作晋升等方面有所妥协。所以，我可以想象企业会因此受益，拥有更快乐、更忠诚的员工，当这类关系得到认可时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rhaina Cohen**: um yeah it's interesting I I mean I think that people are more content when uh they have a life that sort of holistically feels full. I know that there's research also, I mean, if you're thinking specifically about friendships in the workplace that that can um be really uh sort of have have effects on retention um if people feel close close to others at work. But if it's, you know, if you're talking about close friendships outside of work, um, and let's say it's an occasion like someone is sick in their lives, um, I think people will feel, uh, a sense of, um, gratitude to the or, you know, organization that they are being seen as a whole person who, um, isn't just there to be a kind of cog um, in the machine and, um, where there are very narrow exceptions for when they're they're not allowed to work. Um I I think people like respond to that really well and it it feels in line with um you know different kinds of like affinity groups within organizations or the way that people um can be uh really committed to a workplace that gives them um high quality family benefits uh because they think that that will better, you know, allow them to experience the entirety of their their lives and um not feel like they're compromising um you know, getting promoted at work and that kind of thing. So, I I can imagine that that businesses would would benefit um and have happier and more devoted employees um when these sorts of relationships are are recognized

</details>

**主持人**: 我想这种影响可能会从组织层面延伸到社区层面，影响社区处理和思考这个问题的方式。嗯，读你的书时，真正打动我的一点是，你遇到的人群多样性，他们选择了追求这类关系。这似乎超越了种族、性别、年龄、性取向等所有身份认同因素。尽管你确实看到，人们不同的身份认同因素会影响他们处理这类关系的方式。所以，我很好奇，当我们展望未来，你如何看待随着世界人口结构持续演变，其中一些变化将如何发生？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: and I imagine that probably trickles out beyond organizations into the way communities sort of t tackle this and think about this too. Um well, one thing that really struck me in reading your book is is really the diversity of people who have you you've encountered who have chosen to sort of pursue these types of relationships. It seems to really transcend everything from race, gender, age, sexuality, all types of of of of identifying factors. Although you do see that the different identifying factors people have impact the way that those involved navigate uh these sorts of relationships. So, I'm curious to know as we sort of look to the future, how you you see um some of this changing as the demographic makeup of our of our world continues to evolve.

</details>

**Rhaina Cohen**: 是的，这非常重要。谢谢你这么说。对我来说，展示拥有这类友谊的人群多样性非常重要。这不仅仅是某些群体。我认为年轻人常常认为他们发明了一切。而事实上，我认为最感人的故事是那些六七十岁、八十岁的人，他们真正展示了拥有真正忠诚的长期友谊是什么样子。但是，你知道，随着我们前进，一些人口趋势表明人们会发现，或者有必要更广泛地寻求他们所需的支持和联结。我写到的许多人，他们的生活并没有完全按照他们预期的那样发展。他们可能没有找到伴侣。或者我写到一个人，她处于**无性恋谱系**中，并意识到一种标准或传统的关系不是她会追求的那种。我认为，随着我们看到结婚率下降和人们晚婚，这可以成为一种鼓励，促使人们更有创意地寻找一种让自己感到满足的生活。我认为人们也越来越认识到，我们对健康关系设定的期望实际上正在损害这些关系，而拥有更广泛的人际关系真的很有帮助。我的意思是，心理学家**Esther Perel**曾有名言，我们现在期望一个人能做到过去一个村庄才能做到的事。所以，我认为有一些文化力量可能会越来越多地鼓励人们关注友谊的重要性，并拓宽他们希望在生活中拥有的人群类型。而且，我认为我只是看到了人们对“**选择性家庭**”的兴趣激增，特别是对于照护者来说，拥有“村庄”这个概念，即他们不必独自一人。育儿对许多人来说是如此困难和孤立，而我看到人们对这个话题的兴趣越来越大，我可以指出一些组织正在为此努力，以回应这种日益增长的兴趣，即寻求朋友的帮助，并创造性地思考如何重建过去更常见、在某些文化中也存在的模式，即不只是拥有一个小核心家庭，而是拥有多代同堂的家庭或大家庭，其中有叔叔阿姨，他们可能与你没有血缘关系，但却能感受到那种深厚的联结。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rhaina Cohen**: Yeah, it was really important. I mean, thank you for saying that. It was really important to me to show that uh the variety of people who have these sorts of friendships. It is not um just some I don't like I think young people um often uh believe that they're they've invented everything. And in fact, I think the most powerful stories were people in their, you know, 60s,7s, 80s who have who have really uh shown what it looks like to have um a real committed long-term friendship. Uh but you know, as we move forward, some there are demographic trends that I think point to people finding um or or having the need to look more broadly for the kind of support and connection that they get. Um many of the people that I wrote about um something, you know, something didn't quite work out in their lives that they as they'd expected. They didn't they maybe didn't find a partner. Um or there's one person I wrote about who is um on the **asexual spectrum** and realized that uh sort of I don't know a standard or like conventional relationship was not going to be the kind of thing that they would pursue. And I think as we see um the rates of marriage declining and people getting married later um that that is can be a form of encouragement to be more creative with um finding a life that you uh feel fulfilled by. Uh I think there's also increasing recognition that the ways that we have uh set expectations for a a healthy relationship are um actually undermining um those relationships and that it really helps to have um a wider set of people. I mean **Esther Perel**, the psychologist has famously said that we uh now expect of one person what we used to expect of a whole village. So I think there are some kind of cultural forces that might that might increasingly encourage people to look to the significance of their friendships and broadening um the kinds of people that they um want to have in their lives. And I think I've just seen such a blow up in interest um in **chosen families** um and also um particularly for caregivers having this idea of a village uh that they are they don't have to go it alone that um parenting has been so difficult for so many people and isolating and um there's just a lot more interest um that I I have seen and I can point to sort of like organizations that of uh that are doing work on this in response to that um that growing interest in um looking to to friends and re being creative about what it what it looks like to to kind of like rebuild something that had existed more commonly in the past and exists in some kind of um some cultures um as all over the the place to not just have a small nuclear family but maybe to have multigenerational homes or extended households where you have aunties and uncles who may or may not be related to uh to you, but really feel like those those deep um connections.

### 科技对友谊的影响

**主持人**: 嗯，你之前提到了科技，以及它在你的研究中并不是一个重要的部分，但当我们展望未来时，我很想听听你对科技将如何影响所有关系，特别是你所说的这些柏拉图式伙伴关系的看法。很多人说科技可能会让我们更多地疏远彼此，花更多时间远离人类，减少彼此互动。你认为这将在这些关系的未来中扮演什么角色？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Well, you mentioned um tech earlier and how that wasn't really a big part of how you approached this, but as we're thinking to the future, I'm interested to hear your perspective on how you think tech will impact the the nature of I guess all relationships, but these sort of platonic partnerships as you as you say. Um, a lot of people say that they that tech might lead us to retreat from each other more and spend more time away from other humans interacting less with one another. How do you see this playing a role in the future of these relationships?

</details>

**Rhaina Cohen**: 我的最佳猜测是，它将是喜忧参半的，就像现在一样。所以，我非常感激我有一种方式可以与世界各地的朋友保持联系。我的意思是，就在前几天，我有一个朋友给我发短信，你知道，一张她住的地方的照片，说她在想我。她住在国家的另一边，我们每年只能面对面见几次。或者，你知道，我昨天散步时给一个住在另一个城市的朋友留了一条语音备忘录。所以，我认为这些能够联系或协调的方式，比如一起旅行，或者其他什么，都是科技能够帮助我们维系友谊的绝佳方式。我认为风险在于，当科技取代了你原本可能与朋友进行的互动时。当你不断观看YouTube视频，或者你与一个从未见过的人建立了**准社会关系**，并且感觉，你知道，你好像被播客主持人、电视明星或名人所了解，但它本质上是单向的。所以，我认为科技可以给我们一种拥有关系的幻觉，而我们却被拥有了。然后，我认为随着这些围绕AI工具的新技术出现，它们非常擅长模仿人类关系的某些方面。我认为其中一个担忧是，拥有关系再次涉及这种单向性。与真实的人类，甚至是宠物，任何有生命的生物建立关系，都会伴随着一些困难。我记得我认识的一位记者讲过一个故事，她去拜访一些正在研究机器人的团队，他们认为这些机器人将成为年轻人的朋友，成为孩子们的玩伴，并取代iPad互动。这位记者对此感到有点不安，她开玩笑说：“你们有没有想过找一个**AI女友**？因为她没有任何需求。”他们也开发了一种**AI狗**，他们说它的优点是，你不需要清理它的尿液或粪便，也不需要训练它，诸如此类，没有需求。而这家初创公司的人并没有把这当成玩笑，他们说：“哦，那是个有趣的想法。”所以，我认为如果人们习惯了那种不需要付出任何东西就能得到他们想要的一切的互动，那不仅会成为一个问题，因为它取代了你与他人相处的时间，而且因为它会成为一个任何人都无法达到的比较标准。因为一段关系是双向的，它不可能总是简单或轻松的。所以，这可能是我对未来科技以及它可能如何塑造我们对友谊的看法的最大担忧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rhaina Cohen**: I mean, my best guess is that it will be a mixed bag as it currently is a mixed bag. So, I feel really grateful that I have a way um to be in touch with friends from all over the place. I mean, just the other day, I had a friend um text me uh you know, a photo from a place she say staying and that she was thinking of me. She lives on the other side of the country and we only get to see each other a few times a year in person. Um uh or you know, I left a voice memo on a walk yesterday for a friend of mine who lives in another city. Um, so I I think those ways of of being able to reach out um or coordinate so that you can go on a trip together or you know whatot um those are great part like ways that technology can um can enable or help us maintain friendships. I think the risk comes when technology becomes a replacement for the kinds of um interactions that you would might otherwise have with friends. um when you're you know watching YouTube video after YouTube video or you develop a **parasocial relationship** with someone that you haven't met and it feels um you know it it might feel like you uh you are being known by whatever the uh I work in podcasting but you know I think this can happen with **podcast hosts** or with television with celebrities um but it's but it's fundamentally one-sided so um I think tech can give us the illusion of having relationships when we owned and then the I think that with this newer technologies um that around um **AI tools** that uh are are really you know skillful at mimicking certain aspects of um human uh relationships. Um I think one of the concerns there is that having relation is again about this one-sidedness. um that having relationships with real humans or even like pets um like any kind of living being is uh comes with like some difficulties and I'm recalling a story that um a journalist I um I know told where she was visiting some people uh who are working on these robots that will they think will kind of um become friends for young you know for kids uh and it's supposed to be a replacement for iPad interaction And uh this journalist was you know a little bit unnerved by this and she was kind of cracking a joke about like oh have you guys thought about um you know getting an **AI girlfriend** because she wouldn't have any needs. Um and this was they they'd also come up with like an **AI dog** that like the the advantage that they said was you know you don't have to clean their pee or poop or train them or whatever. No needs. And these um the people at the startup were like didn't take it as a joke. they were like, "Oh, that's that's like an interesting idea." Um, so I think the if the if people become used to interactions where there is nothing that they have to give up um and they're getting what they want when they want it all the time, that that um not only becomes a problem because it it it displaces time you would spend with other people um but also because it becomes this comparison point that is impossible for any person to meet. um because a relationship is two-sided and it's just not always going to um be simple or easy all the time. So that that's um maybe my my biggest concern around the um the future of technology and how it might shape our our thinking about friendships

**Rhaina Cohen**: 嗯，你知道，我想我仍然会听到自己为一些事情道歉，然后不得不收回道歉。我认为，给予他人也是一种方式。所以，那可能不像分享生活中正在发生困难的事情那样显得脆弱。但我想到一个朋友，她在家招待我们一小群人。我认为让别人进入你的家，本身就是一件非常私密、能展现自我的事情。她给我们所有人做了饭，而且是多道菜，她的爱和关怀的表达方式就是食物。而且，你知道，我的乔迁派对上，她带来了那些令人难以置信的**Royos茶酥饼干**。所以，我认为，通过给予他人，以一种特别能体现你可能在思考他们会喜欢什么的方式给予，并让他们稍微接触你的生活，即使只是你墙上的艺术品，你书架上的书，这也可以成为一种较小的脆弱性表现。我还认为，了解自己哪些条件能让你更容易展现脆弱是很有用的。我认为对我来说，我可能更容易在别人的家里敞开心扉，而不是在公共场合。所以，环境可以成为通往那种亲密关系的门户。所以，是的，我的意思是，这些都是我认为在不立即寻求帮助的情况下，稍微展现脆弱的方式。通过给予他人支持，你也在给予他们许可，也许以后可以寻求帮助，同时也给予他们寻求帮助的许可。

**Rhaina Cohen**: um you know I think I still have I will hear myself apologize for things and then have to backtrack on the apology. Um I think also like giving to people is one. Uh so that that might not feel vulnerable in the um in the same way as you know sharing that something difficult is going on in your life. But I'm thinking about a a friend who uh hosted a a small group of us at her house. I think letting people into your home um is a very uh kind of intimate revealing thing period. and she just fed us all and had like multiple courses and she, you know, her um expression of of love and care is food. Um and and also like had, you know, my housewarming had brought these like incredible **Royos tea shortbread cookies**. So, um I what there's there are ways that I think giving to other people and giving in a way that shows that you are um maybe thinking about what in particular they might enjoy. Um and giving them a little bit of exposure to to your life, even if that's just like what's the art on your walls, what are the books on your shelf? Um that can be um a more um a smaller form of vulnerability. And I also think um it's useful to understand for yourself like what are the conditions that make it easier to um to be vulnerable. I think for me I'm probably more likely to open up um in someone's home than I am uh out in public. Uh so you can have these uh um the setting can be kind of a gateway to that kind of um intimacy. Uh so yeah I but you know um yeah but so those are ways to I think be a little bit vulnerable without feeling like you're you're immediately asking um for help and that by giving support to people you're also make giving um permission um to maybe later ask for help and also giving them permission to ask for help as well.

**主持人**: 好的，**Rhaina**，当我们结束这次对话时，我一开始就提到了我们正在进入的这个季节，也就是假日季。对于很多人来说，这是一个可以放大联结感，也放大孤独感的时期。那么，你认为我们所有人可以如何拓宽我们对家庭的理解，以及那些维系我们的关系，以度过这一年中的这个时期？

**主持人**: Well, Rain, as we wind down this conversation and I I sort of open by talking about the time of year that we're, you know, entering the holiday season and uh, you know, this is a time for a lot of people that can magnify connection and also loneliness. Um, so what are some ways you think we all can broaden our sense of family and the relationships that sustain us as we go into this period of the year?

</details>

**Rhaina Cohen**: 是的，我完全理解这是一个复杂且有时艰难的时期。我来分享一个今年我和朋友们正在做的事情。我的丈夫是荷兰人，荷兰有一个非常重要的节日叫做**圣尼古拉斯节**（Sinterklaas），它涉及秘密圣诞老人，你需要写诗来搭配礼物，这应该很有趣。我和他一直想为彼此做这件事。我们在一起很久了，但很少做，因为只有两个人就不那么刺激。我们现在和另外六个人住在一起，我突然想到我们可以像他小时候他家人那样，庆祝这个节日。我们基本上是把一个家庭传统拿过来，让朋友们也参与其中。我认为这可能与一年中许多事情相关，这种“人越多越热闹”的感觉，因为如果你独自一人，或者你只有另外一个人，你不想吃一顿完整的感恩节大餐，或者其他任何节日，这可能会很困难。所以我的建议是，有没有某种传统或事情，在一年中的这个时期做起来会感觉很好，也许你把它与家庭联系在一起，但也可以邀请其他人参与进来。我认为“**友谊感恩节**”（friendsgiving）这个想法，在美国过去几年里变得非常流行，就是这种做法的一个版本，它可以是人们体验感恩节的一种非常可爱的方式，但对象不一定是他们的血亲。所以，是的，这是我的一个建议，可以帮助人们不觉得自己被困于既定的家庭状况，他们可以创造自己喜欢或可能喜欢的这个时期的版本。

**Rhaina Cohen**: Yeah, I totally understand that it is um, it is a complicated and sometimes like difficult time. Um I'll share you know one thing that uh had occurred uh that that I'm doing with my friends this year. Um so my husband is Dutch and there is a very um important holiday called **Sinterklaas** in the Netherlands and it involves uh essentially like a **secret Santa** and you write poems that go with the gift and it's it's kind of um you know supposed to be fun and we have want he and I have wanted to do this for each other. um we've been together for a long time and have not um have not often done it because with two people it's like not that exciting. um we we now live with six other people and um it occurred to me that we could do what his family had done when he was a kid and um and celebrate this holiday that we're um essentially taking what had been a family tradition and and letting friends uh be be part of that. Um, and I and I think that this is probably relevant for a number of things this time of year where there is this sort of more the marrier feeling in that it can be hard if you're on your own um or maybe you just have like one other person that you don't want to have a full Thanksgiving meal or you know um what like whatever the the kind of holiday is. So my suggestion would be is there some kind of uh sort of tradition or thing that feel would feel really nice to do this time of year that you that um maybe you have attached to family uh but could be something that you invite other people into. Uh I think the idea of I think **friendsgiving** which has has become very popular in the last several years in the US uh is one version of that and it can be um a really like lovely way for people to experience Thanksgiving but among people who are not necessarily their blood relatives. So um yeah that that's one one suggestion that I have um for help having people be um to not feel like they are stuck with whatever the given family situation is and that they can um make their own version of um what they the things that they enjoy or might enjoy about this time of year.
