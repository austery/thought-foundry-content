### 墨西哥毒枭身亡引发全国动荡

《纽约时报》播报，主持人 Tracy Mumford 报道了今日（2月23日，星期一）的头条新闻。在墨西哥，政府宣布击毙该国头号通缉毒枭后，全国范围内爆发了新一轮的混乱。当局表示，绰号“El Mencho”的内梅西奥·奥塞格拉·塞万提斯（Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes）在昨天的政府抓捕行动中死亡。他被广泛认为是该国最为暴力的犯罪分子之一，领导着一个强大的犯罪集团，该集团不仅贩运可卡因、冰毒和芬太尼等毒品，还将业务扩展至其他领域。

在其死亡后，全国各地爆发了暴力事件，贩毒集团的成员以令人不安的武力展示作为回应。武装团体封锁道路，并纵火焚烧超市、银行和车辆。一位目击者描述，在热门旅游目的地巴亚尔塔港（Puerto Vallarta），蒙面男子强行将一名公交车司机拖下车并纵火焚烧。暴力事件已蔓延至至少13个州，但大部分集中在瓜达拉哈拉市。音乐会和足球比赛被取消，部分航班被转飞，美国政府警告部分地区的美国公民“就地避险”，直至另行通知。

过去，毒枭头目的被捕曾引发类似暴力，有时是敌对帮派争夺权力，有时是集团对政府的报复。墨西哥总统克劳迪娅·舍恩鲍姆（Claudia Sheinbaum）已呼吁墨西哥民众保持冷静，并表示全国大部分地区正按正常情况运行。在舍恩鲍姆的领导下，墨西哥发起了十多年来最严厉的禁毒行动，而“El Mencho”的死亡标志着其政府的一项重大胜利。这也可能缓解来自美国总统特朗普的压力，特朗普曾威胁若墨西哥不解决毒品贩运问题，将对其采取打击行动。然而，一些安全分析人士认为，尽管舍恩鲍姆采取了强硬措施，但贩毒集团依然过于强大且根深蒂固，难以彻底根除。

From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Monday, February 23rd. Here's what we're covering.

In Mexico, the government's announcement that it killed the nation's most wanted cartel boss has set off a wave of mayhem. Authorities said that Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as El Mencho, died in a government operation to capture him yesterday. He was widely regarded as one of the country's most violent criminal figures, overseeing a powerful gang that trafficked drugs like cocaine, meth, and fentanyl, and expanded into other enterprises, too.

After his death, violence broke out across the country as cartel operatives responded with an unsettling show of force. Armed groups blocked roads and set fire to supermarkets, banks, and vehicles. One witness described seeing masked men forced the driver off of a city bus and lighted on fire in Porto Viarta, a popular tourist destination. The violence has spread across at least 13 states, though the bulk of it has unfolded in the city of Guadalajara. Concerts and soccer matches were cancelled yesterday. Some flights were diverted and the US government warned American citizens in some areas to quote shelter in place until further notice.

In the past, previous captures of cartel leaders have ignited violence like this, sometimes among rival gangs jocking for power, sometimes from groups lashing out at the government. Mexico's president Claudia Shinbomb has urged Mexicans to stay calm and said things are proceeding as normal in most of the country. Under Shinebomb, Mexico has launched its most intense campaign against the cartels in more than a decade. And Eleno's death marks a major victory for her administration. It could also ease pressure on the country from President Trump, who has threatened strikes in Mexico if it doesn't address drug trafficking and smuggling.

Some security analysts say though that despite Shine Bomb's aggressive approach, the cartels remain too powerful and too entrenched to fully eradicate.

### 特朗普政府推行新关税政策

与此同时，在美国华盛顿，总统特朗普正推进其关税计划。他宣布将签署一项命令，根据第122条实施10%的全球关税，尽管最高法院在上周五的裁决中驳回了他此前设立的许多关税措施。特朗普表示：“这很荒谬，但没关系，因为我们有其他方法，无数其他方法。” 在裁决公布后不久，他宣布了10%的全球关税，随后在周六又表示将提高至15%。为实施新的关税收费，他正在使用不同于最高法院裁决的法律依据，而是援引了一项1970年代的贸易法条款，此前从未有总统使用过。

特朗普还继续抨击那些对他不利的法官，称他们为“傻瓜”和“走狗”。他特别针对了**尼尔·戈萨奇（Neil Gorsuch）**和**艾米·科尼·巴雷特（Amy Coney Barrett）**，这两位法官都是他任命的。在预算层面，最高法院的裁决给美国带来了新的波动性。关税已成为政府收入的关键来源，目前尚不清楚特朗普能否弥补其去年签署的扩张性减税计划所需的资金缺口。目前，关于已从公司那里征收的数十亿美元关税将如何处理的问题仍悬而未决。最高法院已将如何处理退款的问题留给美国国际贸易法院和下级法院处理，特朗普政府表示这可能需要数年时间来解决。

In Washington >> today, I will sign an order to impose a 10% global tariff under section 122.

President Trump is pushing forward with his plans for tariffs despite the Supreme Court's ruling on Friday that struck down many of those he'd put in place.

>> It's ridiculous, but it's okay because we have other ways, numerous other ways.

>> Right after the ruling, he announced a 10% global tariff, then said Saturday he was raising it to 15%.

to impose the new sir charges. He's using a different legal authority than the statute the justices ruled on. He's invoking a provision of a 1970s trade law that no president has used before.

Trump has also continued to lash out against the justices who ruled against him, calling them fools and lap dogs.

>> I I think it's an embarrassment to their families. You want to know the truth? The two of them? Yeah. He's taken particular aim at Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, both of whom he appointed. At the budget level, the court's ruling has unleashed a new level of volatility for the US. Tariffs had become a key source of government revenue, and it's unclear if Trump will be able to make up the difference to help pay for the expansive tax cut he signed into law last year.

For now, the question of what will happen to the billions of dollars in sir charges that were already collected from companies is still up in the air. The Supreme Court left it to the US Court of International Trade and lower courts to figure out how refunds should work. The Trump administration has said it could take years to sort out.

### 美伊紧张局势升级与潜在冲突

此外，美国与伊朗的谈判代表本周将举行会晤，这似乎是避免军事冲突的最后一次努力。伊朗外交部长本周末继续坚持，该国不愿放弃其核计划，包括铀浓缩的权利，并表示有权享受和平的核能。然而，特朗普政府同样坚持认为，伊朗的核计划是不可接受的。美国一直在加大对伊朗的压力，已在中东集结了自23年前准备入侵伊拉克以来规模最大的军事力量。尽管尚未做出最终决定，但《纽约时报》获悉，特朗普倾向于在未来几天内进行一次初步打击，以表明伊朗必须愿意合作。这可能伴随着报复的可能性。美国及其他西方安全官员表示，他们正在监测日益令人担忧的迹象，即如果特朗普下令对伊朗进行大规模打击，伊朗可能会指示其代理人针对欧洲和中东的美国目标发动恐怖袭击。

Now, three more updates on the administration.

Negotiators for the US and Iran are scheduled to meet this week in what appears to be lastditch talks to avoid a military conflict.

>> Well, first of all, enrichment is our right. We have every right to enjoy a peaceful nuclear energy, including enrichment. Iran's foreign minister continued to insist this weekend that the country was not willing to give up its nuclear program, but the Trump administration has similarly insisted that's not acceptable. The US has been turning up the pressure on Iran. It's now amassed the largest military force it's had in the Middle East since it prepared for the invasion of Iraq 23 years ago. Though no final decisions have been made, the Times has learned Trump has been leaning toward conducting an initial strike in coming days to demonstrate to Iran that it must be willing to cooperate. That would come with the possibility of retaliation. US and other Western security officials say they're monitoring increasingly worrying signs that Iran could direct its proxies to conduct terrorist attacks against American targets in Europe and the Middle East if Trump orders large-scale strikes against the country.

### 美国政府部分停摆影响与海湖庄园安全事件

与此同时，影响国土安全部的部分政府停摆，已让一些旅客感到困惑。民主党人拒绝为该部门提供资金，除非对移民官员施加新的限制，这已对国土安全部的其他分支机构（如交通安全管理局 TSA）产生了连锁反应。绝大多数 TSA 员工在停摆期间仍需工作，但风险在于，停摆时间越长，可能导致机场延误，因为未获支付的员工开始请病假或不来上班。周末曾出现一阵混乱，此前国土安全部表示将暂停 TSA PreCheck 以重新分配资源，随后又改变主意，表示 Precheck 仍在进行。一些民主党议员质疑暂停优先安检将如何提供帮助，其中一人指责特朗普政府“故意惩罚美国人民”。

最后一条更新涉及海湖庄园（Mar-a-Lago）的安全事件。凌晨1点30分，安保人员发现一名男子已进入庄园的内层区域。当局称，周日在总统佛罗里达州私人俱乐部被枪杀身亡的男子，在与特勤局和当地执法人员对峙时，携带了一支霰弹枪和一个煤气罐。他们表示，该男子将霰弹枪举起至“射击姿势”。在此情况下，一名副警长和两名特勤局特工开枪将其击毙，消除了威胁。特朗普当时不在俱乐部。这名持枪男子被迅速确认为来自北卡罗来纳州卡梅伦的21岁男子奥斯汀·塔克·马丁（Austin Tucker Martin）。他的家人，包括他的母亲，整个周末都在 Facebook 上发帖说他失踪了。联邦调查局（FBI）正在调查这起枪击事件。一位曾与马丁在青年军（Junior ROC）共事过的女士表示，他来自一个支持特朗普的家庭。他去年开始了一项绘制高尔夫球场路线的生意。在2024年，曾有一名男子在特朗普的另一处佛罗里达俱乐部袭击他，这发生在针对他在宾夕法尼亚州遇刺的几周后。

Also, the partial government shutdown affecting the Department of Homeland Security has left some travelers wondering what exactly is happening. Democrats have refused to fund the department without new restrictions on immigration agents, and that has meant ripple effects for other branches of DHS like TSA. The vast majority of TSA employees are required to work during shutdowns. But there's the risk that the longer it goes on, the more it could cause airport delays as unpaid workers begin to call in sick or don't show up.

There was a swirl of confusion over the weekend after DHS said it would pause TSA PreCheck to refocus resources, then reversed course and said Precheck was still going. Some Democratic lawmakers have questioned how suspending priority screenings would have helped with one accusing the Trump administration of quote purposely punishing the American people.

And last update,

>> at 1:30 this morning, the security detail detected that a individual had made his way into the inner perimeter of Mara Lago.

>> Authorities say the man who was shot and killed on Sunday at the president's private club in Florida was carrying a shotgun and a gas canister after officers from the Secret Service and local law enforcement confronted him. They said he raised his shotgun in a quote shooting position. At that point in time, the deputy and the two Secret Service agents fired their weapons and neutralized the threat.

>> Trump was not at the club at the time of the incident.

>> The armed man was quickly identified as 21-year-old Austin Tucker Martin from Cameron, North Carolina. Members of his family, including his mother, had posted on Facebook throughout the weekend that he was missing. The FBI is investigating the shooting. A woman who served with Martin in junior ROC said he came from a proTrump family. He started a business last year drawing golf courses. In 2024, a man targeted Trump at another one of his clubs in Florida. That happened just weeks after the assassination attempt on him in Pennsylvania.

### 冬季风暴席卷美国东北部

最后，冬季尚未结束。一场席卷美国东北部和中大西洋地区的大规模风暴已导致航班和铁路线路中断，数十万户家庭断电，并使超过4000万人处于暴风雪警告之下。该地区部分地区可能降雪达2英尺（约61厘米），纽约预计将迎来18英寸（约46厘米）的降雪。纽约市的公立学校将迎来一个日益罕见的假期——雪天。自在线学习兴起以来，全国各地的学校大多已将此类天气转为远程学习日，这已失去了往日的“魔力”。然而今天，当东海岸在短短几周内第二次遭遇冬季风暴的袭击时，纽约的孩子们迎来了一个真正的、老式的雪天假期。

以上是今日的头条新闻。今天在《The Daily》节目中，将有更多关于最高法院关税裁决的全球影响的报道。您可以在《纽约时报》应用程序或您收听播客的任何平台收听。我是 Tracy Mumford，明天再会。

And finally, winter is not over yet. A massive storm hitting the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic has shut down flights and rail lines, left hundreds of thousands of households without power, and has more than 40 million people under blizzard warnings. Some parts of the region could see as much as 2 ft of snow. New York is forecast to get 18 in.

And the city's public schools are getting something that's become increasingly rare, a snow day. Since the rise of online learning, schools around the country have largely turned those into remote learning days, which just don't quite have the same magic. Today, though, as the East Coast gets slammed with a winter storm for the second time in just a few weeks, it is an actual snow day for New York kids. The old-fashioned kind.

Those are the headlines. Today on the Daily, more on the global fallout from the Supreme Court's tariff ruling. You can listen to that in the New York Times app or wherever you get your podcasts. I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow.
