title: 拥抱不完美：时间有限的人生哲学访谈
summary: 本期TED Talks Daily读书俱乐部邀请作家**Oliver Burkeman**，讨论其新书《凡人的冥想》。他分享了从追求完美到拥抱不完美的心路历程，强调人生有限，应停止与不可避免的现实抗争，专注于真正重要之事。访谈还探讨了在信息过载时代如何管理注意力，区分健康的自我接纳与自满，以及如何从“不足”转向“富足”的雄心观。Burkeman提出，活在当下，从“健全”而非“努力争取”的状态出发，是实现有意义生活的关键。

### 欢迎与新书介绍

**Elise Hugh**: 大家好，欢迎收听。我是**TED Talks Daily**播客的主持人**Elise Hugh**。今天很高兴能和大家一起参加我们的**TED Talks Daily**读书俱乐部最新一期活动，以及这场现场活动。这是我们**TED Talks Daily**播客的一个特别系列，这个节目每天都会带来启发人心的思想。今天我非常兴奋，因为我们读书俱乐部的嘉宾是**Oliver Burkeman**。他是一位作家、记者和TEDx演讲者，曾在**《卫报》**工作多年，在那里他撰写了一个广受欢迎的心理学周专栏。他还写了三本书，包括**《解药：给那些无法忍受积极思考的人的幸福指南》**（Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can't Stand Positive Thinking），以及《纽约时报》畅销书**《4000周：凡人时间管理》**（4,000 Weeks: Time Management for Mortals）。我刚在开始前告诉**Oliver**，这是我推荐最多的一本书。这本书基于一个假设：如果我们幸运的话，平均有**4000周**的生命。**Oliver**已经做过两次TEDx演讲。他出版并正在发行一份名为**《不完美主义者》**（The Imperfectionist）的通讯，这是一封关于在迷茫时代建立有意义生活的邮件。

**Elise Hugh**: Hello and welcome. I am Elise Hugh, the host of the TED Talks Daily podcast, and I'm so glad to be with you today for the latest edition of our TED Talks Daily Book Club along with this live event. This is a special series on our TED Talks Daily podcast, a show where we deliver ideas that inspire daily. I'm so excited today because we have for our book club guest, Oliver Burkeman. He's a writer, journalist, and TEDex speaker who worked for many years at The Guardian newspaper where he wrote a popular weekly psychology column. He also has written three books including Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can't Stand Positive Thinking, and the New York Times bestseller 4,000 Weeks: Time Management for Mortals, which I just told Oliver before we started, is the book that I recommend the most. The book is based on the assumption that we have an average of 4,000 weeks to live if we're lucky. And Oliver has given two TEDex talks. He has published and publishes a newsletter called The Imperfectionist, an email on building a meaningful life in the age of bewilderment.

**Elise Hugh**: 今天我们在这里谈论他的最新著作，他的新书**《凡人的冥想：拥抱你的局限，为重要之事腾出时间》**（Meditations for Mortals: Four Weeks to Embrace Your Limitations and Make Time for What Counts），这本书提供了一种不同的方法，通过**Oliver**称之为**不完美主义**（imperfectionism）的生活指导哲学，来对重要的事情采取行动。**Oliver Burkeman**，欢迎来到读书俱乐部。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: And today we are here to talk about his latest book, his newest book, Meditations for Mortals. four weeks to embrace your limitations and make time for what counts, which offers a different approach on taking action on what counts using a guiding philosophy of life that Oliver calls imperfectionism. Oliver Burkeman, welcome to the book club.

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 哦，非常感谢邀请我。我真的非常高兴来到这里，我从英格兰北部的**北约克郡**向你们问好。很高兴来到这里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: Oh, thank you so much for having me. I'm really, really glad to be here coming to you from uh North Yorkshire in the north of England. It's lovely to be here

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: 我听说那里已经天黑了，而且很冷。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: where I hear it it's already dark and quite cold.

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 哦，是的。天黑大概一个小时了。明天早上9点之前都会是黑的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: Oh, yes. It's been dark for like an hour or something. It'll be dark until 9 in the morning tomorrow.

</details>

### 从专栏到不完美主义的转变

**Elise Hugh**: 谢谢你和我们一起熬夜。在我们深入讨论你的新书之前，我想问问你走到这一步的心路历程。我之前提到了你为**《卫报》**撰写的周专栏。它叫**《本专栏将改变你的生活》**（This Column Will Change Your Life），内容涵盖心理学、自助、生产力和文化。从某种意义上说，仅仅是撰写这个专栏就改变了你自己的轨迹。你在那里学到了什么，让你走到了今天？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: Well, thank you for staying awake with us. Um, before we get into your newest book, I want to ask you a bit about your journey to this point. I mentioned your weekly column for the Guardian before. It was called This Column Will Change Your Life, and it covered psychology, self-help, productivity, and culture. In a sense, just writing the column did kind of change your own trajectory. What did you learn there? um that kind of wound got got you to where you are today?

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 是的，这是个好问题。我的意思是，是的，我花了很多时间向人们解释，把一个专栏命名为**《本专栏将改变你的生活》**是带有讽刺意味的。在某种程度上，它是开玩笑的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: Yeah, it's a good question. I mean, so yes, I I spent a lot of time having to explain to people that calling a column this column will change your life was meant to be sardonic. It was meant to be tongue and cheek on some level,

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 但它确实改变了我自己的生活，我不知道是否改变了别人的。原因在于，我认为在撰写那个专栏的第一个十年或更长的时间里，我非常沉浸在一种心态中，至少是无意识地，试图找到一个系统、一种生活哲学或一种实践，能够解决我所有的问题，让我觉得自己终于能够掌控生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: but um but it did sort of change mine at any rate. I don't know about anybody else's. Um the reason is that I think that I was very much for the first part of that decade or more that I was writing that column I was very much in the mindset of at least unconsciously you know trying to find the system or the life philosophy or the practice that would solve all my problems that would make me feel like I was finally kind of in control of life.

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 是的。而且，如果你从事不同类型的工作，你可能偶尔有机会阅读书籍和探索这些事情。但如果这是你的工作，你就会经历如此多的“万能药”候选方案，以至于你最终开始意识到，也许我还没有找到这个东西，不是因为我需要找到下一个，也许这里有更深层次、更有趣的事情正在发生。也许寻找一种解决“为人”这个问题的想法本身就有问题。所以这让我踏上了通往**《4000周》**，然后是这本新书的旅程。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: Yeah. And um you know if you have a a different kind of job you might get the chance to read books and explore these things every so often. But if you're doing it as your work you get to go through so many um candidate magic bullets for right sorting your life out that you actually eventually begin to realize like oh maybe there's maybe the reason I haven't found this yet is not because I just need to find the next one. Maybe there's something deeper and more interesting going on here. Maybe there's something problematic about the idea that I should be looking for uh you know the very idea that I should be looking for a a way to solve the problem of being human. So that got me started on the journey that led to 4,000 weeks and then this new book.

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: 是的。现在有很多时间管理技巧和优化文化，以及我们所处的更普遍的“工作狂”状态。你是什么时候意识到这种**生产力心态**实际上是在让生活变得更小，而不是更大？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: Yeah. There's a lot of time hacking and optimization culture and obviously the larger sort of workcoholism that we're in. When did you realize that this productivity mindset was actually making life smaller rather than larger?

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 是的，我的意思是，这绝对是一个渐进的过程。令人惊讶的是，你可以尝试多少这些技巧和窍门，它们却不起作用，但你仍然会觉得“哦，再多一个月，或者再多20%的自律，比我生命中任何时候都做到的更多，然后我就能度过难关了。”但是我在**《4000周》**中写到，有一次我坐在布鲁克林**展望公园**（Prospect Park）的长凳上，当时我们住在那里，我正要去我的工作室，比平时背负着更多的记者截稿日期，拼命想弄明白如何使用所有这些技术来让自己在本周末达到目标。然后我突然意识到，哦，这些东西永远都不会奏效。这不可能。我正在尝试做一些不可能的事情。问题不是我没有找到正确的方法，而是我正在尝试做不可能的事情。那一刻发生了很大的转变。我不知道你怎么样，我就是那种很容易发生这种智力转变的人，然后我需要很多年才能真正地活出这些转变的含义。但那是一个起点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: Yeah, I mean it was definitely a gradual thing. Uh it's amazing how how many of these tricks and tips you can try and have them kind of not work um and still feel like oh just one more month or 20% more self-discipline than I've ever managed to um show at any other previous moment in my life and then I'll be over the over the hump. Um, but I do write in 4,000 Weeks about how a moment that I was, um, uh, sitting on a park bench in Prospect Park in Brooklyn, where we lived at the time, on my way to my workspace and sort of more overburdened with journalistic deadlines than usual, and desperately trying to fathom how I was going to use all these techniques and and and the rest of it to get myself through to the to where I needed to be by the end of the week. and and just sort of suddenly realizing like, oh, none of this is ever going to work. Like, this is impossible. I'm trying to The problem here is I'm trying to do something impossible. The problem is not that I haven't found uh the right way to do it. And there was a big shift in that moment. I don't know about you, I'm the kind of person who has these kind of intellectual shifts very easily and then it takes me like years to really kind of live into the implications of them. But that was a starting point.

</details>

### 不完美主义的实践

**Elise Hugh**: 是的。那有什么影响呢？如果你放弃了**完美主义**的想法，接下来会发生什么？这在实践中如何应用？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: Yeah. What are the implications? So, if you kind of give up on the idea of per perfectionism, what happens next? How does that practically apply?

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 我的意思是，这里有两种不同的想法，对吧？因为我们一直在谈论不堪重负，然后我们又在谈论**完美主义**。对于今天在座的一些人来说，**完美主义**这个词的第一个联想很可能与想要创造完美的作品有关，对吧？所以，它更多地与你待办事项清单上有多少无关，而是与你希望它在执行上绝对无懈可击有关。我正在提出一个论点，尤其是在新书中，即**完美主义**适用于很多事情，对吧？所以，想要完美优化，就像你一直在谈论的，想要完美掌控一切，想要产出完美的作品，取悦他人，我认为这也是一种**完美主义**，对吧？想要确切地知道每个人都喜欢你，并且此刻没有人对你生气，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: I mean, there's two different ideas here, right? Because we've been talking about overwhelm and then we're talking about perfectionism. And for some people uh with us today, you might the first association of the word perfectionism might well be to do with wanting to create perfect work, right? So, it's not so much to do with how much you've got on your to-do list. It's about wanting it to be absolutely uh faultless in the execution. I'm sort of making the argument especially in the new book that perfectionism applies to a whole lot of things right so wanting to be perfectly optimized as you've been talking about wanting to be perfectly on top of everything wanting to produce perfect work people pleasing I think that is also a kind of perfectionism right wanting wanting to know for sure that everybody is um uh

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: 喜欢你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: likes you

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 喜欢你，并且此刻没有对你生气，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: likes you and isn't mad at you at this very moment right

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 嗯，所以正是针对这种非常宽泛的**完美主义**定义，即试图完全掌控你在世界上所做的一切，我提出了**不完美主义**（imperfectionism）这个概念。它实际上只是一种观点，它说：如果我们从这样一个想法开始，即总会有太多事情要做，我们永远无法确定没有人对我们生气，我们永远无法将作品带入世界，使其符合我们心中绝对完美的标准，以及所有其他的一切。如果我们只是从那个“破碎的地方”开始呢？对吧？那个不完美的地方。是否有可能，那实际上是真正完成重要事情并享受这个过程的更好方法呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: and um and so it's against that very broad definition of perfectionism, the attempt to feel in total control of what you're doing in the world that I oppose this bring this notion of imperfectionism which is really the just the viewpoint that says well what if we start from the idea that there will always be too much to do that we will never be able to be certain that nobody's mad at us that we will never bring work into the world that matches up to the absolutely perfect uh standards in our minds and all the rest of it. What if we just sort of began from that um that broken place, right? That imperfect place. Would it is it possible that actually that could be a much better recipe for really getting the important things done and actually enjoying the process as well?

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: 我的意思是，这听起来有点像佛教思想的基础，对吧？就像人类可能从我们存在以来就一直在经历某种这种问题或困境。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: I mean, it sounds a little bit like the foundations of Buddhist thought, right? Like humans have probably experienced some um flavor of this problem or this conundrum for as long as we've been around. Uh

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 哦，不，完全是。我认为这绝对是，首先，显然我在这本新书或我的任何一本书中写的所有内容，都是对各种现有智慧传统和宗教传统的一种综合。然后，是的，我认为它也是一种宗教思想。嗯，与佛教的相似之处可能今天在座的很多人都会产生共鸣，但它也与基督教以及无疑所有其他传统都有相似之处。这只是那种想法，即将人类状况视为一个我们必须解决的问题，这似乎并不是通往一种充满存在感、意义和行动的生活的方式。所以，这就像是……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: oh, no, totally. I think it is absolutely firstly just obviously this is what all I'm writing about in the new book or any of my books is a sort of uh synthesis of all sorts of existing wisdom traditions and religious traditions and then yes I think it it is a sort of a is a sort of a religious uh thought as well. Um the the the parallel with Buddhism may be echoing for lots of people here today but also there's parallels with Christianity and doubtless all sorts of other traditions. It's just that notion of like well seeing the human condition as a problem that we've got to solve seems to not be the way that um to to to to make it to a life of presence and meaning and action. So it's like

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 我们能否从“我们不会解决那个问题”的想法开始，而是真正地去体验生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: can we start from the idea that we're not going to solve that problem and really live the experience instead.

</details>

### 不完美主义的“魔力”与共鸣

**Elise Hugh**: 为什么**不完美主义**，正如你所写，是“魔力开始的地方”？在你意识到“好吧，我可以摆脱这种普遍的追求”之后，接下来会发生什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: Why is imperfectionism as you write where the magic begins sort sort of after you kind of come to the realization like okay I can be free of this general quest then what

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 嗯，首先，我并不认为我比一个正在进步中的人更好，对吧？所以我当然不是从一种完美的精神启蒙状态来向你分享我的见解。但是，嗯，回答这个问题的一种方式是指出，实际上，试图在某种程度上掌控生活，试图把每件事都做得恰到好处，试图掌控一切，这似乎会……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: well firstly like I don't think I'm anything other than a work in progress at this myself right so I'm certainly not coming to you from a state of perfect spiritual enlightenment and uh sharing my uh my insights with you in that way But well, so one way to respond to this is to point out that actually there's something about trying to be in control of life to a certain extent and trying to do everything exactly right and trying to be on top of everything that seems to

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: 挤压掉生活的活力、乐趣和精华。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: squeeze out the the vibrancy, the enjoyment, the the juice

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 挤压掉生活的活力、乐趣和精华。在新书中，我一定程度上依赖了一位名叫**Hartmut Rosa**的德国理论家，他写了大量关于他称之为**共鸣**（resonance）这个想法的学术著作。这个想法是说，真正赋予生命意义的是我们与世界之间某种特定的振动。结果是，即使你成功地将生活**超优化**（hyperoptimizing），你也无法获得这种共鸣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: from from life. I rely in the new book to some extent on a German theorist called Hart Rosa who has written this um a huge amount of scholarly stuff on this idea that he calls resonance. The idea that what really gives life its meaning is this certain kind of well right resonance right a vibration of some sort between us and the world. And it turns out that this is not what you get. Like even if you succeed in like hyperoptimizing your life.

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 首先，你实际上无法完成所有工作，因为它是无限的。我们可以讨论这一点，那是另一个话题。但是……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: Firstly, you won't actually get through all the work because it's infinite. And we can talk about that. That's a separate point. But

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: yes,

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 但即使你获得了那种程度的控制，你也会希望自己没有它。嗯，**Alan Watts**有一句很棒的话，你知道，那位60年代和70年代著名的精神娱乐家，他说，如果你将技术推向完美的极致，拥有可以完全按照你想要的方式为你做任何事情的机器，那么在这个过程的最后，你最终会想要一个写着“给我惊喜”的按钮，因为当我们以那种方式真正掌控生活时，缺少的就是惊喜。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: but even if you get that level of control, you sort of will wish that you didn't have it. Um there's a lovely quote from Alan Watts, you know, the famous old spiritual Yes. entertainer from the 60s and the 70s that like if if you carried technology to its perfect conclusion and you had a machines that could do everything you wanted for you exactly as you wanted it, what you would want in the end at the end of that process is a button that said surprise me because that's what's not there when we really get into the driving seat of of life in that way.

</details>

### 有限时间与生命意义

**Elise Hugh**: 让我们转向另一个想法，因为这本新书是你的前一本书**《4000周》**的伴侣或对话，那本书都是关于理解我们的时间是有限的。正如你所写，为什么理解这一点是通往意义的大门？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: Let's move on to that other idea because this new book is kind of a companion or in conversation with your previous book 4,000 Weeks which is all about understanding that our time is finite. Why is understanding this the door to meaning as you write?

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 我想从本质上说，因为我认为我们花费了大量时间，我们生命中的大部分时间都在做一些事情，虽然我们可能没有意识到，但这些事情实际上是情感上逃避“有限”这个事实的方式。所以我们投入了大量的精力，无论我们是否意识到，都在努力不让自己感到受限，无论是在我们拥有的时间方面，还是在我们对时间的控制方面。所以，是的，你在我有点不屑的那些**生产力书籍**中会发现很多**生产力技术**，我认为它们基本上都在提供一个承诺，让你不必感到有限，对吧？这就像是：把这个系统落实到位，很快，可能是在未来，绝不是现在，你就不必在时间上做出艰难的选择。你就不必感受只能做你所能想象的事情的一小部分所带来的失望和牺牲。当你，这和控制是一样的，对吧？如果你试图控制完美的工作，它会让一切都变得非常痛苦和折磨。当你能更多地接受这种局限性的真相时，你会经历一个转变，你实际上能够更活在当下，因为你会觉得，“好吧，我不需要花一整天责备自己没有找到做所有事情的神奇方法。我不需要对仍然有成百上千的事情我还没有着手感到震惊和惊讶，因为它们永远都会存在。”相反，也许我今天的工作只是挑选几件重要的事情，然后真正投入我的时间和注意力去做它们。所以它真的是……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: I guess in essence because I think that we spend a lot of time a lot of our lives doing things which while we may not realize it are actually kind of ways of emotionally avoiding the truth of being finite. So we put a lot of effort whether we realize it or not into not feeling limited both in terms of the amount of time we have and the amount of control we have over that time. So yeah, a lot of the productivity techniques that you will find in the kind of productivity books that I disdain a little bit um I think are basically offering the promise that you that of of of not having to feel finite, right? It's like put this system into place and soon enough probably later in the future, it's never right now. Um you you'll you won't have to make hard choices with your time. you won't have to um feel the disappointment and the sacrifice of only ever being able to do a small proportion of the things you can imagine doing. And when you kind of and it's the same with control, right? If you're trying to control perfect work, it makes everything very agonizing and tortured. When you can let in the truth of that limitation a little bit more, you undergo a shift where you're actually be able to be more present in life because it's like, well, okay, I don't need to spend the day beating myself up for not having found the magic way to do all the things. I don't need to be shocked and surprised that there are still hundreds and hundreds of things I have yet to get around to because there always will be. and instead maybe it's my job today just to pick a few of the things that matter and really pour my time and attention into them. So it's really

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 在这方面，停止与不可避免的真相抗争，真的是一种解脱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: it's really freeing in that respect to stop fighting against the unavoidable truth I suppose.

</details>

### 信息过载与注意力管理

**Elise Hugh**: 是的。你提到了**注意力**，你写了很多关于如何集中我们的**注意力**，尤其是在我们所处的这个**信息过载**时代和**注意力经济**中。鉴于我们所处的时代，以及我们每天目睹或经历的各种恐怖事件，我被书中早期的一个时刻深深打动，你写到了**信息过载**的危险，尤其是在社交媒体的影响下，这让我们感到需要同时关注所有事情。你思考，是否少数几千人一生中深入关注一个问题，会比成千上万的人在社交媒体上看到信息后只关注几分钟更好？为什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: Yeah. You mention attention and you write a lot about kind of focusing our attention especially as it pertains to this information overload age that we're in and the attention economy. um especially given the time that we're living in and the various horrors that we're witnessing or experiencing on a daily basis. I was really struck by a moment early on in the book um when you write about the danger of information overload, especially given social media, which leads us to feel this need to care about everything all at once all the time. And you wonder whether it would be better for just a few thousand people to focus on and care about one issue deeply over the course of a lifetime than for hundreds and thousands of us to care about something for a few minutes after we see it come through our feeds. Why?

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 嗯，那个具体的思想实验来自一位伟大的作家兼博主**David Kaine**。他提出论点说，你知道，稀释的**注意力**做不了多少事，而少数人集中**注意力**可以做很多事。我想我在这里试图表达的更广泛的观点是，存在这样一种旧观念，来自另一个时代，认为做一个好公民，做一个好人，意味着找到方法让自己更多地关注外部世界和世界的苦难。而我们现在生活在一个，你很清楚，信息和关于世界上发生的可怕事情的信息完全泛滥的世界。稀缺的资源是我们自己的**注意力**，所有社交媒体平台的工作方式都是通过将我们的**注意力**货币化。我认为由此可以得出结论，实际上，在现代世界中，公民有责任愿意对某些事情不予关注，这对于任何关心世界的人来说都非常困难，对吧？这就像是“你告诉我，我应该对待这个问题，它显然非常严重，对吧？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: Well, that specific thought experiment comes from a a great writer blogger called David Kaine. and he's sort of making the the argument that that you know you can't do very much with very diluted attention and you can do a lot a small number of people can do a lot with more focus. The I guess the broader point that I'm trying to get at there is just this notion that that there is this old idea from from another era really now that being a good citizen, being a good person means finding ways to make yourself pay more attention to the outside world and to the sufferings of the world. And we live now as you well know um you know in a world where it's information and information about awful things happening in the world is completely abundant. The scarce resources our own attention and the way all the social media platforms and the rest of it work is by is by monetizing our attention. I think it follows from this that um actually there's a duty of a citizen in the modern world to be willing to withhold attention from things as well which is very hard for anyone who cares about the world right it's like what you're telling me I should take this issue which is obviously really serious right

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: 而且显然涉及很多受苦的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: and obviously involves an awful lot of people suffering

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 而且不去思考它？我的论点是，嗯，是的，首先是因为我们关注的方式在很多方面都被误导，以为我们正在产生影响，对吧？这种想法就是……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: and not think about it and my argument is well yes firstly because there are many ways in which our paying attention is we're misled into thinking we're making a difference, right? The idea that just

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: **注意力**不一定是主动的，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: attention isn't necessarily active,

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 对，对，仅仅告诉社交媒体平台你关心，并不一定能帮助到实际中的任何人。但同时，那种愿意说“好吧，这个特定的世界危机，这个特定的人道主义灾难，气候危机的这个特定方面，无论它是什么，我不是说它不真实，也不是说它不重要。我只是说，那不会是我的战场，因为其他的事情才是我的战场，我将每周投入这么多小时去做志愿者，或者我将把我可支配收入的这一部分捐给那个事业。”我认为人们很容易认为更多的**注意力**总是更好的，但实际上我们的**注意力**是有限的，情况并非如此。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: right? And just right and just telling the rest of a social media platform that you care is not necessarily helping anybody on the ground as it were. But also like that willingness to say, okay, this particular world crisis, this particular humanitarian disaster, this particular aspect of the climate crisis, whatever it is, I'm not saying it's not real or that it doesn't really matter. I'm just saying that's not going to be my battle because this other thing is my battle and I'm going to put so many hours a week into volunteering or I'm going to give this proportion of my um you know disposable income that I can afford to give to that cause. I think it's really easy to think that yeah more attention is always better and actually our attention is finite and that is not is not the case. Yeah.

</details>

### 自我接纳与自满的区别

**Elise Hugh**: 回到大局，对时间有限的接受和对我们局限性的接受，何时会导致一种无助或听天由命的感觉？我将引入我们**TED**成员**Kenny S.**的问题，他问：“我们如何区分对自身局限的健康接受与自满或放弃我们真正想要或关心的事情？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: Zooming back out, when does acceptance of the idea that time is finite and acceptance of our limitations lead to a kind of helplessness or resignation? And I'm going to bring in one of our TED members, Kenny S. here, um, who asks, "How can we discern between a healthy acceptance of our limits versus complacency or giving up on something that we really want or care about?"

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 是的，这是一个很好的问题。嗯，我总是必须摸索着回答，因为我并不认为我个人有任何危险。我的问题，我有很多问题，但它们更多地与试图做太多事情、好高骛远然后筋疲力尽有关。我并不认为我个人有很大的风险会说“哦，那做任何事情还有什么意义呢？”但这是一个真实的问题。我认为，嗯，首先，许多**正念**和**佛教**的老师多次强调的一点是，**接受**（acceptance）与**听天由命**（resignation）不同。它不是说你的生活方式或世界现状必须永远如此。它是关于真正承认它现在确实是那样。这是一个非常强大的举动，不需要与“我想我猜什么都不会改变了，我只能忍受它”的想法混淆。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: Yeah, it's a great question. Um, and I al always have to sort of feel my way into it because I I don't think I'm in any personal danger. Like my problem I have plenty of problems, but they're but they're very much to do with like trying to do too too many things and overreaching and then getting burned out. And I don't think I'm at a personal huge risk of sort of being like, oh, what's the point in doing anything then? But it is a real issue. And I think that um I mean firstly there's the point that many sort of teachers of mindfulness and Buddhism make many times right which is that acceptance is not the same as resignation. It's not about saying that the way your life is or the way the world is it just always has to be that way. It's about really acknowledging that it in fact is that way right now. And that's a very powerful move that doesn't need to be confused with the idea of like guess I've guessed nothing's ever going to change then and I've just got to to live with it.

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 还有这个想法，嗯，我在新书中写到，我们倾向于陷入一种关于什么才算作**有意义的行动**（meaningful action）的观念中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: There's also this um idea that I've uh that I write about in the new book that um we we tend to get caught up in in an idea of what counts as a as a meaningful action

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 这可能会产生很多讽刺的、意想不到的后果，对吧？我们倾向于认为，世界上唯一重要的事情是非常重大的行动，或者那些将流传千古、影响成千上万人的行动。然而，我认为我们从生活中都知道，实际上非常小的事情也可以完全有意义，对吧？为你的孩子做一顿营养餐，照顾年迈的亲戚，或者在美丽的风景中徒步旅行，这些事情并非没有意义。从某种程度上说，一千年后它们可能不会被记住，但它们确实很重要。所以，我认为我的回应的另一部分是，我们应该把我们的生活看作是已经充满了重要事物的地方，然后从这个立场出发，选择额外的抱负去实现。但我们不是从“我的生活完全没有意义，所以我为什么要努力让它更有意义？”这种地方出发。而是“生活本身就可以有意义。”我认为这是一个重要的观点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: that can be very um that can have lots of sort of ironic uh unintended consequences, right? We tend to think of we tend to think that the only things that matter in the world are are very like big actions or actions that will resonate down the centuries or affect hundreds of thousands of people or something like that. Whereas I think we all know from our lives that really very small things can be completely meaningful, right? There's nothing not meaningful about cooking a nutritious meal for your kids or caring for an elderly relative or going for a hike in a beautiful landscape. like these things are not going to be remembered on some level thousand years from now, but um but they but they matter. And and so I think um the other part of my response is that um you know we we can we can look at our lives as things that are already full of things that matter and from that position then choose additional ambitions to to work into them. But we don't come from this place of like well first of all my life's completely meaningless and so why should I try to how can I make it more meaningful? It's like life can be meaningful already. I think that's an important point.

### 放弃控制的诱惑与恐惧

**Elise Hugh**: 你还要求我们放弃对**控制**的追求，这在当今文化中非常普遍。你认为这种冲动为何如此顽固？为什么这些**生产力书籍**会畅销？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: You also ask us to drop this quest for control which is pretty prevalent in today's culture. Why do you think that impulse is so stubborn? Why do these productivity books sell?

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 是的，我的意思是它确实非常顽固，在我身上也很顽固，对吧？所以，我不知道我是否在说要完全放弃它。我想我是在说，我们能否都找到方法稍微放松一点？我认为，你能在多大程度上做到这一点，即使它令人恐惧和脆弱，都将是有益的。它如此吸引人的原因，我的意思是，这个答案有很多不同的层面，对吧？我们生活在一个文化和经济文化中，它不断地让我们觉得，唯一能让我们保持清醒的方法就是获得更多的**控制**。我认为我们来自，你知道，在西方世界，在全球北方，我们来自非常重视技术和其他对世界的**控制**的文化。然后，回到最根本的原因，因为它总是如此，我认为这只是对**死亡的恐惧**，对吧？我们试图拼命争取一种对生活的掌控，让我们感到最终安全。但出生到生活中，就意味着某种程度上的不安全，对吧？因为它就是，嗯，这有点令人沮丧，但我认为它实际上一点也不令人沮丧，对吧？这就像是，作为一个人出生，就是发现自己处于这种脆弱的位置，走向死亡。我的意思是，这就是它的本质。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: Yeah, I mean it's really stubborn and it's stubborn in me, right? So, I'm not I don't know that I'm even saying drop it. I think I'm saying can we all find ways to just like unclench just a little bit and any any degree to which I think you can do that even though it's scary and vulnerable to do it is is is going to be beneficial. The reason it's so appealing, I mean, there are so many different layers to this answer, right? that we we live in a culture and an economic culture that relentlessly causes us to feel that it's the only way to keep our heads above water is to get more control. I think we come from uh you know in the sort of in the in the western world in the global north we come from from uh cultures that very much prioritize um technological and other control of the world and then right back at the bottom because it always is I think it's just the fear of death right we we we are trying to scramble into a position over life where we would feel safe at past. But to be born into life is to sort of be unsafe, right? Because it's to be it's very well, it's slightly depressing material, but I think it's actually not depressing at all, right? It's like to be born as a human is just to find yourself in this vulnerable position on your way to death. I mean, that's what it is.

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 而且实际上，那种“我能否爬上河岸，而不是被河流推着前进”的前景非常非常诱人。我们看到所有这些例子，你知道，有著名的例子，人们试图尽其所能地活得尽可能长。我认为这最终可能都源于同样的动机。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: And and actually um the prospect of like, well, could I scramble up onto the riverbank instead of being born forward on it is very very very um seductive. We see all these kinds of, you know, there are famous examples of uh people trying to do everything they can to live for as long as they possibly can. And I think it probably ultimately is is all comes from the same motivation.

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 我认为其中一些人会同意这源于那种动机。顺便说一句，我并不是在批评他们。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: And I think some of those people would agree that it comes from that motivation. By the way, I'm not I'm not really criticizing them. Yeah,

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: 当然有很多**长生不老兄弟**（immortality bros）在那里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: there's a lot of immortality bros out there for sure.

</details>

### 放松心态的好处

**Elise Hugh**: 嗯，对于那些还没有读过这本书，也没有思考过其中各种想法的人来说，你所说的“放松心态”会给我们带来什么？它实际上如何让生活更丰富？对你来说它是如何起作用的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: Um what does for folks who haven't read the book yet and meditated on the various ideas inside it um what does unclenching as you say what does that get us how does it actually open up more life how did it work for you

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 我的意思是，如果我能稍微谈谈这本书的结构，对我来说，写一本类似于那些帮助过我，并且可能继续帮助我的书，是非常重要的，因为我确实以那种方式来对待我的写作。所以，它被分成28个短章节，然后又分成四周。这个想法，这个邀请，对吧，就是每天做一章，持续28天。考虑到这本书的主旨是不要那么**控制狂**，我不能真的强迫任何人以那种特定的方式去做。那会是不公平的，也是虚伪的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: I mean this is something if I'm if I can talk a little bit about the structure of the book it was very important to me to to try to sort of write the kind of book that is similar to things that have helped me and that might also continue to help me because I definitely approach my writing in that way. So, it's divided into 28 short chapters which are then divided into four weeks. And the idea, the invitation, right, is to is to do one a day for 28 days. Given that it's all about not being such a control freak, I can't really try to force anybody that specific way. That would be unfair, but hypocritical. But um

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 它试图做的是，或者说我试图做的是，克服许多个人发展写作中存在的问题，我认为这些问题要么给你一个很棒的视角转变，但你不知道如何处理它；要么给你一整套复杂的技巧和窍门去实践，然后你就会想，“好吧，等我有一个月的空闲时间，我就会去做。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: what that tries to do or what I'm trying to do there is to get over this problem with a lot of personal development writing I think where it either gives you a great perspective shift but then you don't know what to do with it or it gives you like a whole complicated set of tips and tricks to put into practice and you're like okay when I get a free month I'll I'll finally get around to doing that.

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: Mhm.

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 相反，我提出的是，如果我能引导你经历一个小的视角转变，但在一个月内反复进行，这样你接下来的24小时可能会过得稍微不同，而不是没有那个视角转变呢？所以，你知道，如果你愿意，我们可以谈论其中任何一个，但其中有一章是关于对**决策**采取稍微不同的方法。有一章是关于对如何设定一天的目标，或者如何思考一天中可能出现的干扰，采取稍微不同的方法。嗯，这个想法就是将这些不同的视角转变层层叠加，就在生活的中间，对吧？你不必等到清空了收件箱里的2万封邮件才开始实践。它就像是就在事情的中间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: and instead say like what if I could lead you through a small perspective shift but repeatedly over the course of a month such that you might live the next 24 hours a little more um a little differently than if you hadn't had that perspective shift. So, you know, we could talk about any of these if you want, but so there's a chapter on uh taking a slightly different approach to decision- making. There's a chapter on um slightly different approach to how you set goals for the day or how you think about interruptions that might arise in the course of the day. Um and the idea is just to sort of layer these different perspective shifts right in the middle of life, right? You don't have to wait until you've cleared the 20,000 emails from your inbox before you before you put this into practice. It's it's like right in the middle of things.

</details>

### 少数群体与不完美主义

**Elise Hugh**: 我们的一位**TED**成员提出了一个重要问题，我想向你提出。**Katherine N**写道：“少数群体应该如何看待接受不完美而不是与之抗争的建议，考虑到我们可能付出的代价，无论是在权利、机会、安全还是财务方面，都可能高得多？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: One of our TED members asks an important question that I wanted to bring to you. Katherine N writes, "How should minorities navigate the advice to embrace per imperfection instead of fighting it given that the price we pay maybe in terms of rights or access, safety, finances can be considerably higher?"

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 这是一个很好的问题。我认为理解这一点非常重要，即世界上人类所遇到的痛苦和困难至少有两种，我们姑且说是两种。一种是普遍存在的，与作为人类有关。另一种是相对的、社会性的，源于人类群体之间的不公正、权力动态以及所有其他因素。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: This is a great question. I think it's really important to understand that there are just simply two at least two but let's say two kinds of um sort of suffering and difficulty that are encountered by humans in the world. And there's the kind that is universal and is related to being a human. And then there's the kind that is that is relative and societal and is uh arises from injustice between groups of humans and power dynamics and all the rest of it.

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: 当然。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: Sure.

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 所以我毫不羞愧地专注于第一种，对吧？这绝不是要否认或削弱第二种。你知道，我们所有人，我们中的任何一个人，无论我们来自什么背景，什么传承或其他任何东西，都不可能……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: So I'm sort of unashamedly focusing on the first kind, right? Which is not in any way to sort of deny or undermine the the second kind. You know, it is impossible for all of us, for any of us, no matter what background we come from, what heritage or anything else m

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 产出的作品能符合我们心中可能有的完美标准，如果我们是**完美主义者**的话，对吧？那是普遍存在的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: to produce work that matches up to the perfect standards we may have of it in our heads if we're perfectionists, right? That's a universal.

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: 但是承认这个事实的代价……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: But the but the the cost of acknowledging that fact,

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: 对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: right,

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: 对某些人来说可能比其他人更大。对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: and might be greater for some people than for others. Right.

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 我仍然坚持认为，无论你在自己的生活中觉得能够多大程度上承认这个事实，它都会带来更自由的生活，更好的工作，以及更有价值的**生产力**。所以，这并不是说对某些人来说不比对其他人更难，也不是说对某些人来说风险不比其他人更高。但在那之下或与此同时，事实是，你知道，试图做人类不可能做到的事情，并不是一种无压力且广阔存在的秘诀。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: I still maintain that it is that that that to whatever degree you feel able in your own life to edge towards acknowledging that fact. It will lead to a freer life, to better work, to more productivity of the kind that counts. So it's not that it isn't harder for some people than others and that the stakes aren't higher for some people than others. But underneath that or alongside that there is the fact that you know trying to do something that is not possible for humans to do is not a recipe for a stress-free uh and expansive uh existence.

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: 一种无压力且更广阔的存在。你提到了更自由的生活。嗯，我们谈到了**共鸣**，这在**《凡人的冥想》**中出现了很多次。什么是**共鸣**？我们如何才能在没有非常复杂系统的情况下达到它？事实上，这恰恰相反，对吧？这就像是放弃那些复杂的系统。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: A stress-free and more expansive existence. You've mentioned a freer life. Um we've talked about resonance which comes up a lot in meditations for mortals. What is resonance? How do we get to it um without a a very complicated system? In fact, this this is the opposite, right? It's like let go of the the complicated systems.

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 我的意思是，它不是说我完全反对系统，我有时可能会这样暗示。对我来说，关键是你为什么要使用这些东西，对吧？所以，嗯，在我自己的生活中，一个很好的例子就是著名的**番茄工作法**（Pomodoro Technique）。哦，对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: I mean it is it is it's not that I've I'm not actually quite as against systems as I may sometimes suggest. The point is for me is why are you using those things right? So uh a good example of this in my own life the famous pomodoro technique. Oh right

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: 很多人……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: which many people

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: **番茄工作法**是一种将你的工作日分成25分钟的区块，中间有小休息的方法。这是一个很好的系统，对吧，没什么问题。问题在于，如果你认为那种技术或任何其他技术会拯救你，对吧？如果你认为它会让你完成所有事情，不必进行任何困难的对话，不必就关注什么以及将多少有限的时间投入到这个人或这个事业或其他事情上做出任何艰难的决定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: as a way of the pomodoro technique is a way of dividing up your um working day into 25 minute chunks with little breaks. But it's a good it's a good system right nothing wrong with it. The the problem is if you think that that technique or any other technique is going to kind of save you, right? If you think it's going to cause you to get all the things done and not have to have any difficult conversations and not have to have any difficult decisions about what to focus on and how much of your finite time you want to give to this person or this um cause or another.

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 所以当我第一次使用它时，它就像所有其他方法一样，让我更加焦虑和紧张。但现在，经过了这种至少是某种程度上的演变，我对这些事情的感受，以及我对作为一个有限的人在一天中能做什么，变得更加脚踏实地和清醒。嗯，当然，**番茄工作法**有时是一个组织我一天的好方法。这完全没问题，但它不再是那种“摆脱人类困境的通行证”。我认为这对我来说是非常重要的一点，以及我所做的任何事情，或者我在生活中所做的任何事情，都能让我回到那个绝对的现实，就像“我在这里。我有这些才能，我有这些精力水平，我有这些注意力，我有一天中的这些时间，我处于这些关系中。”任何能让我回到那个现实的事情，都像是**共鸣**一直都在那里等待着。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: Once I so when I first used it, it was a sort of a it just got me even more anxious and stressed like all the other ones. But these days, having gone through this kind of at least something of an evolution in how I feel about these things and being much more I think uh grounded and sane about um you know the the the what I can do as a finite human in the course of a given day. Well, sure. Then the Pomodoro technique is a totally great way of organizing my day sometimes. Nothing wrong with that at all, but it's no longer this like ticket out of the human condition. I think that's really the the thing that's so important for me and anything that I do or that I anything that I that I do in my life to bring myself back to that absolute reality of like here I am. These are the talents I've got, the energy levels I've got, the attention I've got, the hours in the day I've got, the relationships I'm in. Anything that brings me back to that, it's like the resonance was waiting all along.

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: 嗯，所以这几乎像是回归自我，回归你的……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: Um, uh, so it's almost like a return to yourself, return to your

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 情感引擎。你知道，我当然知道我在这里有点老生常谈，但事实确实如此，世界每天都充满了无数微小的互动或体验，它们可能具有魅力和吸引力。而至少对我们中的一些人来说，最阻碍这一切的是无休止地追求某个日程、待办事项清单的终点或类似的东西。所以，这就像是，是的，生活就在那里。你不需要那么多地去创造它，而是要清除那些阻碍它的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: emotional engine. And you know, we're definitely I know that I'm sort of dicing with cliche here, but it really is true that the world is full of a a million small interactions every day or or experiences that are potentially um enchanting and absorbing ones. And that at least some of us the thing that gets in the way the most of that is being relentlessly in pursuit of some schedule or the end of a to-do list or or something similar. So it's like yeah it's like the life is there. I don't you don't need to you don't so much need to bring it into being as to clear away the the the things that get in the way.

</details>

### 雄心与焦虑：从不足到富足

**Elise Hugh**: 这与**TED**社区成员**Alana W**的一个问题有关，她写道，我合作的许多新兴领导者都担心，如果他们专注于“更柔和的事情”，他们就会失去优势。我认为有一种潜在的信念或恐惧，或者说潜在的信念认为恐惧或焦虑以其多种形式是他们的动力。在你从事这项工作的过程中，你对**雄心**的个人定义和关系是如何改变的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: This is related to a question from a TED community member Alana W who writes many rising leaders I work with are afraid that if they focus on quote unquote softer things they will lose their edge. I think there's an underlying belief or fear or underlying belief that fear or anxiety in its many forms is their fuel. How has your personal definition of and relationship to ambition changed over the time you've been doing this work?

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 哦，我喜欢这个问题，因为我认为我肯定也曾处于那种境地，认为焦虑并不好玩，当时我就是这样，你知道，胃里打结，诸如此类，但是它……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: Oh, I love that question because I think I've been in that place for sure of thinking that like it's not fun to be as anxious as I am at the point this was this described me, you know, to have the knot in my stomach and all the rest of it, but it

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: 但它似乎有效，对吧？在某种程度上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: but it seems to work, right, in some

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 是的。在某种程度上它是有动力的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: Yeah. It's motivating on some level,

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 在某种程度上，它似乎有效。是的。对。嗯，我认为在这项写作工作中，对我来说，一直非常重要的是，要挽救一种与此相符的**雄心**版本，对吧？因为有一种与这种观点兼容的**雄心**。有一种对待大众心理学、自助的方法，我并不一定认为自己对其抱有敌意，但那不是我的方法。如果你真正面对世界的真相，真正理解生活的现实，你变得完全平静和安宁，那么你就会变得非常被动，你不会做太多事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: some definition of the word work. Yeah. Right. Um, and I think it's always been really important to me in this writing work to to to to sort of salvage a version of ambition that goes along with it, right? Because there is a that that is compatible with this outlook. There's a there's a certain kind of approach to uh popular psychology, self-help, which I don't necessarily even think of myself as hostile to, but it isn't mine. Where if you really came to confront the truth of the world and to really sort of understand the reality of of life and you became totally calm and peaceful, then you just sort of become very passive and you wouldn't really do very much.

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 漫无目的地游荡在世间，也许偶尔去参加瑜伽静修，但基本上就是这样，对吧？你只是，我从个性上来说，从来不想成为那样的人。我对我的工作充满**雄心**。所以我希望有一种**雄心**的方式，它不是仅仅由**焦虑**驱动和延续的。嗯，我真的认为有这样一种方式，而且我认为这就是我通过这些发现的东西。你知道，这是一种差异。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: drift through the world and maybe you'd go to a yoga retreat now and again, but that would be basically it, right? You just sort of and I've just on personality grounds, that's not anything that anyone that I've ever wanted to to to to be. I ambitious for my work. And so I I hope that there's a way of being ambitious that is um not just fueled by and perpetuating of anxiety. And um and I really think that there is and I think that that's what something that I have discovered through through some of this. You know, the there's a it's the difference between ambition as a kind of the sort of deficit model of ambition that says like I've got to keep working and working harder and harder and harder just to become and accomplishing more and more and more just to become like an adequate human being. Right? This is the idea that psychologists the concept that psychologists refer to as the insecure overachiever

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 它是**雄心**的一种“不足模式”（deficit model of ambition），它说“我必须不断努力，越来越努力，只是为了成为一个合格的人。”对吧？这是心理学家所说的**不安全感驱动的过度成就者**（insecure overachiever）的概念。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: it's the difference between ambition as a kind of the sort of deficit model of ambition that says like I've got to keep working and working harder and harder and harder just to become and accomplishing more and more and more just to become like an adequate human being. Right? This is the idea that psychologists the concept that psychologists refer to as the insecure overachiever

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: 指的是……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: which refers to

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: 认为我们不够好之类的想法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: the idea that we're not enough or something.

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 对。对。不，完全正确。每当我公开使用这个词时，房间里大约一半的人似乎都完全明白我在说什么。这种观念是，你做了很多事情，取得了很大的成就，人们也这样认为，你可能也获得了许多赞誉，但你做这些的原因是为了填补一个空缺，你从不感到满足，因为每次你取得成就，那都只是你后续成就的新的最低标准，对吧？如果你在某个项目上做得非常好，那么你必须在所有未来的项目上做得同样好或更好。这非常令人紧张。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: Right. Right. No. Exactly. And whenever I use this term in public event or something like half the people in the in the room seem to recognize exactly what I'm what I'm talking about. this notion that um you get a lot done and you achieve a lot and people think and and you maybe you get a lot of accolades but you sort of get it from the reason you're doing it is to sort of plug a hole and you never feel good because every time you achieve something that just becomes the new minimum baseline for your subsequent achievements. Right? If you you you do really well at some project then you've got to do all the future projects just as well or better. And it's it's it's very stressful.

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 但这是可能的，我希望这本新书能提供一些工具来实现这种转变，以不同的方式看待**雄心**，将其视为一种表达，而不是一种试图让自己感觉良好的方式，而是表达你已经足够好、你已经足够了的事实。一旦你不再纠结于这些与**自我价值**相关的挣扎，实际上，建造东西、创造东西和做事情真的很有趣，对吧？大多数人的个性不适合无所事事。我的意思是，如果你是那样的人，并且有能力负担，那当然很好。我不想说别的，但我认为**雄心**是，如果你是一个有**雄心**的人，当你学会放下**焦虑**和**控制**时，它仍然存在。我还认为，如果你观察婴儿或儿童，你知道，我们都天生具有一些内在的创造力。我认为人类渴望创造。嗯，所以回到这一点，我喜欢这种**雄心**的**稀缺模式**（scarcity model of ambition）或**不足模式**（deficit model of ambition）与**富足模式**（abundance model）的框架。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: But it is possible and I hope that the new book has some of the sort of tools for this shift to see um ambition in a different way as as an expression not as a way to try to feel all right but as an expression of the fact that you already that you know that you already are uh all right that you are enough and that once you're not tangled up so much in these kinds of self-worth related struggles Actually, it's just really fun to build things and create things and do things, right? Most people's personalities are not suited to doing very little. I mean, if you are and you can afford to, then absolutely fine. I don't want to to say otherwise, but but I think ambition is if you're an ambitious person, it's still there uh as you as you learn to let go of anxiety and control. I also think that if you observe babies or children, you know, we're all born with some innate creativity, too. I think that humans want to create. Um, and so just returning to that, I love this framework of the scarcity model of ambition or a deficit model of ambition versus a more abundance model

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 或者**盈余模式**（surplus model of ambition）的**雄心**，并带着“我们已经拥有它，我们已经足够了，我们不需要填补任何空白”的想法来对待它。嗯，太棒了。你还写到了你现在如何**展现自我**（showing up for yourself），而“展现自我”是**《凡人的冥想》**中一个完整的章节。为什么“展现自我”是你日常行动计划中拥抱**凡人**和**局限**的最后一个支柱？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: or surplus model of ambition and coming at it um with this idea that we we already have it and we already have enough and we're not trying to plug any gaps. Um, great. You also write about um kind of how you're showing up for yourself now and showing up is a whole section of meditations for mortals. Why is showing up kind of the last pillar in your day-to-day action plan for embracing our mortality and our limitations?

### 活在当下：展现自我

**Oliver Burkeman**: 我的意思是，我认为这真的是所有这一切的唯一意义，对吧？我认为，嗯，书中到那一点为止的所有想法，都在引导着这个想法，嗯，你知道，很难用语言表达，但我想大多数人都知道我们在说什么，那就是，真正活在这里，真正活在你的生活中是可能的。而无法活在当下也是可能的。我认为我们最终无法活在当下的主要方式之一是，我们总是活在未来，活在……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: I mean, I think because really it's it's the only point of of any of this, right? I think that um and all the ideas up to that point in the book are sort of leading up to this idea that that that um you know, it's hard to put into words, but I think most people know what we're speaking about that it is possible to sort of really be here and really be present in your life. And it is possible to to to to not be. One of the main ways I think that we end up not being is that we are sort of perpetually living for the future, living for,

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 你知道，有时这很明显，对吧？人们觉得他们的生活，他们就像在等待，我不知道，直到他们与伴侣安定下来，或者有了孩子，或者直到他们退休，或者诸如此类的里程碑。但很多时候，我甚至在自己身上也注意到，这可能只是活在未来三个小时的想法。这种永恒的状态，就像“我们必须把这个搞定。必须把这个搞定。”但当然……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: you know, sometimes it's very obvious, right? People feel like their life they're sort of like living until they I don't know uh settle down with a partner or have kids or till they've retired or some some those kind of milestones. But very often it's I've noticed even in myself, you know, it can it can be this idea of just sort of living for three hours in the future from now. This sort of perpetual state of like we just got to get this out of the way. Just got to get this out of the way. But of course

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 然后你又进入了一个新的时刻，你知道，未来仍然是未来。所以我认为这本书中我试图让人们回归的实践和事物，以及我自己（如果我现在还没说清楚的话），是回归到看到“现在这里就是真实的生活。”它就像是，对于有限的人类来说，它就是真实的生活。如果你想做一些你关心的事情，对你重要的事情，让你感到活着的事情，那么在某个时候你必须现在就去做。它不能总是等到你把其他事情都搞定之后，或者等你最终知道自己在做什么，不再感到**冒名顶替综合症**（imposter syndrome）或其他什么的时候。它必须发生在当下的某个时刻。嗯，我发现这是一个非常重要的提醒。希望不是一个会带来压力的提醒，对吧？这个想法不是说你现在必须非常自觉地关注你是否正在**展现自我**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: then you're in a new moment and you know the future is still in the future. So I think the practice and the thing I'm trying to bring people back to in the book and and myself if you if I haven't made that clear by now is is is back towards seeing that like this right here is is real life. Like it's it's as real as it's ever going to get for finite humans. If you're going to do some things that you care about uh and that matter to you and that make you feel alive, at some point you're going to have to do them now. It's it's um they can't always be later when you've got the other things out of the way or when you finally know what you're doing and don't feel imposter syndrome or or whatever it might be. It's it's going to have to be in a in a moment of the of the present. Um, and I find this like a really important reminder. Hopefully not a stress inducing reminder, right? The idea is not so that now you've got to be incredibly self-conscious about whether you're showing up,

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: 活在当下，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: living life, right?

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 结果发现，那是一种糟糕的活在当下的方式，对吧？不断问自己是否活在当下。但是，嗯，只是要意识到，如果你想在生命中做一些对你重要、让你感到快乐或你觉得能有所作为的事情，那么在某个时刻，它就必须是现在，无论你是否完全准备好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: Turns out that that is a terrible way to be in the moment, right? To be constantly asking yourself if you're if you're uh in the moment. But um but just to realize that like you've got no option um if if you're going to have spent some of your life doing certain things that matter to you or that you find enjoyable or that or that you feel make a difference like at certain point it's just got to be right now whether you feel completely ready for that or not.

### 冥想的真谛

**Elise Hugh**: **冥想**是书名的一部分。因此，很多人提交了问题，向你寻求建议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: Meditation is in the title of the book. And so as a result, a lot of people submitted questions asking you for your advice.

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 这是一个问题。我们稍后会谈到。抱歉。好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: This is a problem. We'll talk about that in a moment. Sorry. Okay.

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: 是的。关于如何开始**冥想**练习。所以我想提一下，你知道，或者如何坚持下去。我认为我们很多人现在都被文化教导要对**冥想**应该或不应该是什么有一个特定的看法。你在书中分享了一些这方面的内容，但对于听众来说，你有什么建议？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: Yeah. On how to start a meditation practice. So I just want to bring this up, you know, or how to keep going. I think a lot of us have now been culturally taught to have a specific view of what meditation should or shouldn't be. and you share a bit about this throughout your book, but for those listening, what advice do you have?

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 所以，这在某种程度上是我们选择给这本书起的名字所造成的结果，这责任在我和我编辑。嗯，我在这里傲慢地继承的伟大人物，与其说是**佛陀**，不如说是**马可·奥勒留**（Marcus Aurelius），对吧？他的《沉思录》（Meditations）是一系列短小精悍的思想集合，供人反思。是的。嗯，就正式的静坐**冥想**练习而言，我自己是一个相当不规律的**冥想者**。我认为它很棒，而且确实帮助了我，但它在某种程度上一直是我挣扎的地方。话虽如此，正如你所正确知道的，我认为这两个方面，即**冥想**这个词的两种含义，并没有人们最初想象的那么不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: So, this is to some extent, this is an artifact of the title we chose to give the book, and that's on me and my editor. Um, the sort of the great figure that I'm arrogantly taking the mantle of here is less Buddha and more Marcus Aurelius, right, whose meditations are a collection of um short thoughts to reflect upon. Yeah. Um uh and I am myself a pretty sort of patchy uh meditator when it comes to um a sort of a formal seated meditation practice. I think it's wonderful uh and it really helps me but uh it's not it's a place that I've always um struggled with to some extent. That said, as you as you rightly know, I don't think these two things are as different as um as these two senses of the word meditation are as different as one might assume at first.

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 我认为任何能让你脱离你用来观察世界的概念屏幕，并直接审视这些概念，或者跟随你的呼吸，让概念在出现时被放下，任何这样的活动都可以声称具有某种**冥想**的特质。所以，如果这本书中的某些章节所做的只是颠覆某种完全固定的看待事物的方式，嗯，如果它像是一条鱼理解水是什么的行为，那么我认为这也可以算作**冥想**。此外，书中有很多关于习惯和日常习惯的材料，其中**冥想**对很多人来说就是一种习惯。在那里，我真的在强调，今天只做五到十分钟的任何事情，在现实中，远比投入到未来几个月甚至永远每天都要做的宏大计划中更重要。能够放下所有这些，并且在没有任何长期实践保证的情况下，仍然能够今天就做这件事，无论是**冥想**、锻炼还是写日记，或者其他任何事情，在没有长期成为一个不同的人的保证下，仍然能够今天就做这件事，这是一项非常重要的技能。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: I think that any activity that causes you to sort of um disidentify from the conceptual screen that through which you view the world and to either look at those concepts directly or to follow your breath and to allow the concepts to be let go of as they arise. I think they can make a claim to something uh meditative. So if all that some of the sections in this book do is sort of um unseat some kind of completely settled way of viewing things. uh if it's the act of a sort of a fish understanding what water is as it were but I think that I think that gets to count also there's a lot of material in the book about habits and daily habits and all the rest of it of which meditation is is one for a lot of people and there I am really banging the drum for how much more important it is to just do five 10 minutes of whatever the thing is today in reality instead of becoming having invested in sort of very big deal projected out in months into the future schedules about how you're going to do it every single day forever. It's it's such an important skill to be able to let all of that go and with no guarantee that it's part of some long-term practice to still be able to do the thing whether that's meditation or exercise or journaling or whatever to still be able to do it today without without the guarantee that you're becoming a different kind of person in the long term.

</details>

### 最重要的一个领悟：从健全出发

**Elise Hugh**: 在我们进入观众提问之前，我还有最后一个问题。**Oliver**，你在书的开头写道，你并不介意听众或读者忘记他们读过的大部分内容，真正重要的是那些小小的、能留在我们心中的东西。那么，如果我们的听众只能记住**《凡人的冥想》**中的一件事，你希望那会是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: Last question from me before we go to audience questions. Oliver, you write towards the top of your book that you're fine with um listeners or readers forgetting a lot of what they read and that it's the little things that really stick with us that count. So, if one of our listeners remembers only one thing from Meditations for Mortals, what is that one thing that you hope it will be?

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 嗯，这是一个具有挑战性的问题，因为从某种意义上说，我觉得答案必须是这样的：好吧，我来告诉你。在书的结尾，我提到了“从健全出发”（starting from sanity）这个概念。嗯，我用这个词的意思，你可以争论措辞，但我想说的是，如果你想要你的生活是某种样子，在我的例子中，可能是专注、集中、平静、社交连接、有时间休息，嗯，尽我所能应对世界危机，无论是什么，把它看作是你正在努力争取的东西，看作是你有一天会达到的目标，一旦你的生活步入正轨，这是行不通的。它必须是你从中生活的东西。嗯，所以在实际操作中，你知道，我之前举的例子是，如果你知道你的生活需要更多的休息。这与其说是决定两年后休三个月的假，然后努力工作以积累资源来实现，不如说是问问你日常生活中哪里可以有五分钟或十分钟的真正休息。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: Huh. Um, it's a challenging question because in some sense I feel like the answer has to just be something like, okay, here's what I'll say. There's a there's a there's a there's a phrase towards the end of the the book where I talk about um the idea of starting from sanity. Um, and what I mean by this phrase, you can argue with the wording, but what I'm trying to say is if if there is a way that you want your life to be, which in my case might be, you know, attentive and focused, uh, calm, socially connected, making time for rest, uh, doing my part to address the crisis of the world, whatever it is, It's not going to work to see that as something that you're striving towards, right? As something that you're going to get to one day once you've got your life in place. It has to be something that you live from. Uh so in practical terms you know the example I've given before is if you if you know that your life needs more rest in it. It's less about resolving to take a three month sbatical in two years time and then working really hard so that you can get them resources together to do that and much more about asking where in your dayto-day there could be five minutes for 10 minutes for for genuine rest.

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 这种感觉就像你想要在世界上成为什么样的身份，以及你今天能否从中生活一点点。我认为这是表达我希望人们带走的一件事的一种方式。它是关于今天就做这件事，而不是关于在未来完美地、一直地做这件事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: It's that sense of like what is the identity you want to be in the world and can you live from it a little bit today. I think that's one way of saying the one thing that I'd want people to to to to take away. It's about doing the thing today, not about building up to doing the thing perfectly all the time in the future.

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: 是的，我真的很喜欢这个。一点一滴地。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: Yeah, I really like that. Bird by bird.

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: Yes.

</details>

### 帮助他人与自我关怀

**Elise Hugh**: 好的，让我们转向成员提问。**James G**问：“我花了很多时间专注于帮助他人过上更好的生活，这常常以牺牲我自己过上好生活的感觉为代价。我如何才能向内看，并接受我经常提供给别人的同样建议？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: All right, let's jump to member questions. James G asks, "I spend a lot of my time concentrating on helping others have a better life, often at the expense of feeling like I myself have a good life. How can I look inward and accept the same advice that I'm often offering to others?"

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 这是一个很好的问题，而且，无论有意无意，它都为我提供了一个很好的切入点，来谈论书中的一个短章节。所以我知道我确切地想说什么。这总是一种可爱的问题。嗯，我发现，我写过关于这个的，我发现“善待自己”这个概念非常有益。哲学家**Ed Lando**称之为**反黄金法则**（reverse golden rule）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: This is a great question and uh deliberately or not it gives me a great way in to to one to one of the short chapters in the book. So I know exactly what I want to say about this. It's always a a lovely kind of question. Um I have found I've written about this how how beneficial I found um the notion of uh treating yourself. The philosopher Ed Lando calls this the reverse golden rule.

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 不要以你绝不会对待他人的方式对待自己。所以有很多关于**自我同情**和**自我友善**的讨论，这非常非常重要。但我总是有点难以接受。也许是因为我是英国人，也许是因为我是男性，我不知道，随便什么。我感觉自己被要求把自己当作非常特别的人，然后我就对此感到有点不适。对我来说，改变这一点的那一刻是遇到这个想法：如果我只是不比对待别人差很多地对待自己呢？我们很多人，我认为，都有这种倾向，在内心独白中责骂自己，你知道，以你绝不会梦到的方式。就像对别人说那样的话的人，就会被那个朋友圈排斥，对吧？你会因为太讨厌而被赶出派对，但我们却对自己这样做。我真正喜欢**自我友善**这个想法的原因是，它非常平等。我不是在要求，它不是“把自己当作一个非常特别的人”。它只是……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: Not treating yourself in ways you would never dream of treating other people. So there's a lot of talk about self-compassion and self-kindness and all the rest of it and it's very very important. But I have always had a bit of a difficulty with it. Maybe it's being British, maybe it's being male, I don't know, whatever. Like, I feel like I'm being asked to treat myself as very special and then I get all sort of icky about that. The moment that changed that for me was coming across this notion of like what if I what if I explored just not treating myself significantly worse than I than I treat other people. We a lot of us I think have this tendency to berate ourselves in the inner monologue, you know, in ways that you just would never ever ever dream of. Like somebody who said that to somebody else would just be ostracized from that friendship group, right? You'd be kicked out of the party um for being so obnoxious, but we do it to ourselves. And what I really liked about that idea of self-friendliness was then that it's just a it's just very equalizing. It's I'm not asking I'm not it's not treat yourself as a wonderfully special human. It's just like

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 为什么你不值得你已经愿意应用于其他所有人的标准呢？仅仅作为一个日记提示或一个起点，我认为它非常强大。我还认为，最终，我们从**自我友善**的角度帮助他人，比从责备自己的角度帮助他人要有效得多，因为很多时候我们责备自己是为了让自己成为更好的人或什么的，然后我们帮助的所有人都会察觉到这种奇怪的心理剧正在上演，而且效果不佳。所以我认为这是一种双赢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: why don't you deserve the the standards that you already are willing to apply to everyone else? And just as a journal prompt or a way a place to start from I think it's very powerful. I also think that in the end we do help other people much much more effectively from a place of self friendliness than from a place of beating ourselves up because very often we're beating ourselves up in order to make ourselves be better people or something and then all the people we're helping they kind of pick up on the fact that there's this weird psycho drama going on uh and it's not as effective. So I think it's it's kind of a win-win

</details>

### 写作动机与个人成长

**Elise Hugh**: **Miriam SK**问：“在写这本书的过程中，你有什么改变？”嗯，这是指另一位**TED**演讲者**Simon Sinek**。你写这本书的“为什么”是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: to take. Miriam SK asks, "What changed for you during the writing of this book?" Um, and this is a reference to a fellow TED speaker, Simon Synynic. What was your why behind this particular book?

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 我的意思是，我认为我的“为什么”基本上总是试图解决我自己的问题、困难和挣扎。所以**《4000周》**主要与感到不堪重负、焦虑和失控有关。而**《凡人的冥想》**则与知道自己想如何在生活中**展现自我**（show up）与实际做到之间的差距有关。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: I mean, I think my why is always basically to try to work out my own issues and problems and struggles. So 4,000 weeks it was very much to do with feeling overwhelmed and anxious and out of control. And with meditations for mortals it was about the gap between sort of knowing how I wanted to show up in my life and actually doing it. M

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 嗯，所以它总是非常个人化的动机。你知道，有些人，一些关于非虚构写作的建议是，你应该始终关注你正在解决的受众问题，我总是有点担心，因为我确实在专注于解决我自己的问题，但希望，并且有意识地，以一种方式……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: um so so it's always very personally motivated and you know some people some people's advice about non-fiction writing is you should always be focused on the problems of the audience that you're solving and I'm always a bit worried because I am sort of focusing on solving my own but hopefully and consciously in a way that

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 你知道，它基于这样一个观念，即人们挣扎的方式有很多相似之处。对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: you know is based on the notion that I'm there's a lot of similarities between the ways in which people uh have struggled Right.

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: 我认为这本书的受欢迎程度和成功确实表明了这一点，对吧？你所……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: I I think the popularity and success of the book does show that, right? That that what you

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 我的意思是，人们有时给我发邮件说“你就像在我脑子里一样”，我总是很惊讶。这就像是，是的，我认为这主要是因为这和我脑子里的想法很相似。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: I mean I'm always amazed by people saying yeah sometimes people have emailed me and said it's like it's like you're inside my head and it's like yeah I think mainly that's just because it's quite similar to being inside my head.

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: 我认为这是现代人类状况的一部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: This is part of the modern human condition I think.

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 是的。是的。嗯，那个好问题的另一部分答案是，嗯，我写这两本最新书籍的经历对我来说非常奇怪，它们的想法很早就出现了，我把它写进了书稿提案，出版商批准了书稿提案，我得到了出版合同，无论如何……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: Yeah. Yeah. Um, and the other part of the answer to that great question is just that um, I have had the really odd experience to me anyway of writing both these most recent two books where the idea for it comes quite early and I write it in the book proposal and the publisher approves the book proposal and I get a book deal whatever

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 但它的写作，尽管基本思想没有太大变化，为了正确地写它，我确实必须经历一个过程，我确实必须成为一个有点不同的人，对吧？我必须成为一个有点不同的人，与我所写的内容保持一致，否则它就写不出来。所以在**《凡人的冥想》**的例子中，我在结尾提到了这一点，我对**《4000周》**的成功确实产生了一点**冻结反应**（freeze response）。我有点瘫痪了，就像，你知道，我怎么能确保它和之前一样好呢？所以我确实不得不尝试一些非常放松的**自由写作技巧**（freewriting techniques），以及一些允许自己在不知道自己想写什么之前就开始写作的方法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: but the writing of it although it doesn't although the basic idea doesn't change very much in order to write it properly. I do sort of have to undergo a I do have to become a somewhat different person, right? I have to become a sort of uh slightly different person in tune with what I'm writing otherwise it just won't it won't write. So in the case of meditations for mortals and I mentioned this towards the end like I did have a bit of a freeze response to the success of 4,000 weeks. was a little bit like um paralyzed and like you know uh I know how can I make sure it's just as good as whatever and so I did have to experiment with some very unclenchy uh freewriting techniques and ways to sort of um allow myself to write before I knew what it was I was wanting to write.

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 那不是最终出现在书中的内容。我想强调这是过程的开始。但我确实不得不成为那个不那么**控制欲强**的人，才能诚实地写关于少**控制**的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: That's not what ended up in the book. I would like to I would like to stress this the beginning of the process. But so I did actually have to like be that less controlly person in order to write honestly about um controlling things less.

</details>

### 年龄与放松心态

**Elise Hugh**: 是的，听到这个真好。好的，**Gina G**问：“年龄有助于看清大局。**Oliver**在他20多岁的时候能写出这本书吗？我很好奇他对年龄如何影响放松心态的看法。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: Yeah, that's really nice to hear. All right, Gina G asks, "Age is helpful when it comes to seeing the big picture. Would Oliver have been able to write this book in his 20s? I'm curious what his thoughts are on how age factors into unclenching."

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 我认为这是一个非常非常好的观点。我经常思考这个问题，因为，你知道，我20多岁的时候能写出这本书吗？不，我不认为能。嗯，作为一个作家，这给我带来的问题是：这对谁有用？如果这是你必须经历的事情，那么一个希望增加一些有用内容的作家扮演什么角色呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: I think it's a really, really good point. And I think about it a lot because, you know, um would I have been able to write this in my 20ies? No, I don't think so. Um the question as a writer that that brings up for me then is like who is this useful for? And is it if it's something that you have to go through, what is the role of the writer who's sort of hoping to add something useful, right? Like maybe the answer is just you just have to live and then you'll come to these conclusions or you won't.

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: 对。对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: Right. Right.

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 我认为，嗯，有几个想法。我的意思是，其中之一是，我总是对活动中以及通信中，我的观点能引起20多岁和30出头的人的共鸣程度感到非常惊讶，就像我们这些更**中年**的人一样。嗯，我认为在某些方面，这只是因为世界竞争压力和问题的加速，对吧？这就像很多事情……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: And I think that well a couple of thoughts. I mean, one is I'm always really surprised at events and in correspondents and stuff by the degree to which among the people who this resonates with are represented people from in their 20s and uh and early 30s as well as those of us more, you know, midlifey. Um, and I think in some ways that's just because of the sort of accelerating competitive pressures and and problems of the world, right? It's like a lot of things that

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 嗯，很多导致**中年危机**的方面，你可能会说，也许在更年轻的时候就被感受到了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: uh a lot of the aspects of a lot of the pressures that lead to a midlife crisis, you you might say maybe um are being felt uh at a at a younger age.

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 我还认为，在某种程度上，有一种有益之处，我曾在某处读到过这样一种想法，即要比读者领先一步半，对吧？这并不是说我理解了世界上的一切，然后现在把它传授给那些一无所知的人。只是因为我有时间去探索这些事情，作为一份工作，嗯，你也许可以，你知道，这就像是，嗯，在一群人中，所有人都沿着同一条黑暗神秘的道路前进，我只是拿着手电筒。对。我不知道终点，我也不知道目的地，但也许我造了一把手电筒，对我们有用。是的。在这个过程中。它不是什么，我一直在YouTube上看到，我不断看到YouTube上出现同样标题的东西。嗯，我花了40年才学会我将在五分钟内告诉你的东西，对吧？我不知道人们是否见过这种陈词滥调，我不认为它是那样的。我不认为随着时间的推移积累的经验或洞察力可以传递给一个刚刚开始那个年龄生命周期的人，然后他们就可以跳过所有的困难。我不认为它是这样运作的，但我认为在困难中有一个伴侣是件好事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: I also think that there's something beneficial in sort of I read somewhere the idea of being sort of being sort of one and a half steps ahead of the reader, right? It's like it's not that I have um understood everything about the world and now I'm passing it on to people who know nothing about the world. It's just that because I have the luxury of the time to explore these things as a job. Um you can maybe you know um it's like sort of uh um holding the flashlight in a on a in among a group of people all making their way down the same uh uh dark mysterious path. Right. I don't know the end. I don't know the destination either, but but maybe I've maybe I've built a flashlight that could be useful for us. Yeah. In the in the process. What it isn't I in my YouTube all the time at the moment I keep getting things coming up in YouTube that use the same title seat thing. Um it took me 40 years to learn what I'll tell you in five minutes, right? I don't know people have seen this kind of cliche and I don't think it's like that. I don't think it's I don't think experience or insight accumulated over time can be passed on to somebody who's just at the beginning of that age life cycle and then they get to skip all the difficulties. I don't think that's how it works, but I think it can be good to have a companion in the difficulties.

</details>

### 设定优先级与面对后果

**Elise Hugh**: 是的。好的，这说得通。**Maya**问：“当整个清单都感觉像是优先级时，你如何设定优先级？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: Yeah. Okay, that makes sense. Maya asks, "How do you set priorities when the whole list feels like a priority?"

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 实用问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: Practical.

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: 这不是问题吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: Isn't that the question?

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: Yes.

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 我的意思是，关于这一点，首先要说的是，我并不声称这是全部解决方案，因为它更像是一种理性的思考，而不是真实的情感反应。但是，值得记住的是，严格从逻辑上讲，如果每件事都感觉像是优先级，那么你选择哪一件就没那么重要了，因为无论你做出什么选择，你都将做一些非常重要的事情。我认为这实际上有一个名字。我忘了这个悖论的名字，但它确实存在。所以，在某种程度上，所有事情都感觉重要的事实，应该让你感到安心，就像，“好吧，我将在接下来的一个小时里专注于重要的事情C，而不是A、B、D或E。没关系。我仍然会做一些重要的事情。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: I mean, first thing to say about this, I don't claim this is the whole solution because it's a bit of a rational thought instead of a real emotional response. But it is worth remembering that strictly logically speaking, if everything feels like a priority, then it kind of matters a lot less which one you choose because you're going to be doing something really important um no matter what choice you make. And I I think this actually has a name. I've forgotten the name of this paradox, but it like it exists. It's a thing. Um so to some extent, the very fact that everything feels important should just reassure you like, okay, well, I'm going to spend the next hour on important thing C instead of A, B, D, or E. Doesn't matter. I'll still be doing something important. Um

**Oliver Burkeman**: 除此之外，我发现任何一种方法，任何一种组织工作的方法，只要能限制他们所谓的**在制品**（work in progress），都非常有用，我在书中也提到了一些。对吧？所以，你把你手头上的20件极其重要的事情拿出来，然后说：“我现在只专注于这三件，在其中一件完成之前，我不会再关注其他任何事情。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: beyond that, I have found very useful and I talk about them a bit in the book. any kind of method, any approach to um thinking about organizing your work that limits what they call work in progress. Right? So, you take the 20 incredibly important things that you have on your plate and you say, "I'm focusing on these three for now and I'm not going to focus on anymore until one of them is done."

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 这不是因为其他17件不重要。只是因为我正在面对作为一个有限的人的真相。我正在做出这些决定。显然，然后就会出现各种各样的问题，比如什么才算是一个完成的项目，因为你不能在做工作项目的时候把家人搁置，你也不能在上班的时候把浴室里漏水的管道搁置，因为那样浴室就会被淹。你必须以创造性的方式思考它。但那个基本的洞察是，我实际上一次只能做少数几件事。所以，我可以看到并承认这个事实。事实是，以这种方式推进事情，你会做得更多，而且完成得更快，因为你不会整天在50件事之间跳来跳去，而没有任何进展。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: And it's not because the other 17 are not important. It's just because I am facing the truth about being a finite human. I'm making these decisions. Obviously, then all sorts of questions arise about like what counts as a completed project because you can't put your family on hold while you do your work projects and you can't put uh you know the leaking pipe in the bathroom on hold while you like go to your job because then the bathroom's going to flood. You have to think about it in creative ways. But that basic insight of like I actually can't do more than a handful of things at a time. So, so I can just see that fact and acknowledge it. And the truth is that moving things through in this way, you get more done and you get things done faster because you're not spending all your days kind of bouncing between 50 of them and making no progress on any of them.

**Elise Hugh**: 是的。是的。我真的很喜欢这个。好的。嗯，在我们结束之前，最后一个来自观众的问题。**Diana GC**说：“我特别喜欢学习面对我们所做决定的后果这个想法，但我很难接受需要做出的牺牲，这导致我决定我无法承受那些牺牲。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: Yeah. Yeah. I really like that. Okay. Um, last question from the audience before we have to wrap. Diana GC says, "I particularly like the idea of learning to face the consequences of the decisions we make, but struggle a lot to come to terms with the sacrifices that one needs to make, which leads me to decide that I can't afford to make those sacrifices."

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: 我给**Oliver**的问题是，如何实践这一点？我们如何相信自己能够面对任何随之而来的事情？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: My question for Oliver, how does one practice this? How do we trust that we can face whatever comes?

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 所以，书中有句引文。书中每一天都引用了别人的话。其中一句来自治疗师兼作家**Sheldon Cop**，他曾有名言：“你自由地做任何你喜欢的事。你只需要面对后果。”嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: So, there's a quotation in the book. Each of the days in the book sort of plays off a quotation from someone else. And one of those is from Sheldon Cop, the therapist and writer who famously said, "You're free to do whatever you like. You need only face the consequences." Mhm.

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 我认为这对于**决策**来说是一个非常赋能的框架，因为它提醒我们，我在这里说一个简短的版本，因为我知道时间紧迫，但这提醒我们，当我们面对艰难的决定时，我们真正做的只是选择我们想要哪一套缺点。我们实际上很多时候都在犹豫不决中徘徊，因为我们在等待一个没有缺点的解决方案。当你明白对于有限的人类来说，不存在这样的决定时，你选择的任何东西都是在放弃其他东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: Which is a really empowering frame for decision-m I think because it reminds us I'll the short version here because I know time is pressing but that reminds us that like all we're ever really doing in when we face difficult decisions is is choosing which set of downsides we'd like to have. We're not actually a lot of the time we sort of wythe around in indecision because we're waiting for um to come up with a solution that doesn't have downsides. And when you understand that for finite humans there aren't such decisions um that anything you choose is not choosing the other things

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: 当然。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: for sure

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 嗯，以及所有其他方面，每件事都有其缺点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: uh and all sorts of other ways in which everything has a downside.

</details>

**Elise Hugh**: 当然。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elise Hugh**: Sure.

</details>

**Oliver Burkeman**: 那就是对我产生影响的视角转变。对。它让你看到，实际上，即使你不做决定，你也在做决定。你正在进入你生命的下一个阶段、小时、周或天。嗯，你没有，你正在把时间浪费在犹豫不决上，而不是沿着这两条路中的一条走下去。你正在走这条其他的路。我不知道我是否在有限的时间内很好地表达了这一点，但一次又一次，我发现这种负面信息具有令人难以置信的解放性。这就像是，那艘船已经启航了，对吧？产出完美的作品，做出没有缺点的决定，找到一段在某种程度上不会触发你童年创伤的关系，所有这些都已不在考虑范围之内。这太棒了，因为这样你就可以说：“好吧，现在让我们开始真正地生活吧。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oliver Burkeman**: That's the perspective shift that makes the difference to me. Right. It's seeing that actually even if you don't make a decision you are making a decision. you are moving into the next phase, hour or week or day of your life. Uh not having you're using it up on indecision instead of going down one of these two paths. You're going down this this other path. And again and again, I don't know if I'm conveying this well enough in the time available, but again and again, I find this kind of negative message to be incredibly liberating. It's like that ship has already sailed, right? producing perfect work, making a decision that doesn't come with downsides, uh finding a relationship that doesn't on some level trigger stuff from your childhood, like all off the table. And it's so great because then you can be like, "All right, now let's get down to the business of of actually living."
