summary: 本文深入探讨了中国社会中“普通学”现象的兴起及其局限性。在内卷和高压氛围下，许多年轻人试图通过接受“普通”来缓解焦虑，但作者认为这种“普通学”是一种虚假的自我安慰，因为它未能真正批判世俗的成功标准，反而陷入了其逻辑框架。文章呼吁真正的精神解放应主动批判和解构虚假的卓越，建立真正普世的评价体系，以实现个体与社会的和谐。

title: “普通学”的虚假慰藉：为何它无法真正对抗内卷与焦虑？

### 自我认同与“普通学”的兴起

上一期节目，我们探讨了自我探索的益处。评论区也有许多网友分享了他们尝试活出真我的经历。我认为这些故事能够鼓励他人，因此非常感谢大家的分享。在上一期节目的结尾，我们也提到，自我认同是一个人最内在和本质的需求。

<p class="english-text">Previous episode, we talked about the benefits of self-exploration. There are also many netizens in the comment section share your experience of trying to live out your true self. I think these stories can encourage others. So thank you very much for sharing here. At the end of the last episode, we also said, self-identity, it is a person's most inner and essential need.</p>
</details>

如果我们只看到人们的经济需求、生理需求，而看不到因无法认识自我、无法表达真我所造成的精神痛苦，就会错误地低估人格的重要性。结果是，个体要么在某些隐秘之处付出了额外的代价，要么将这种代价转嫁给他人。当我们考虑到这种高昂的机会成本时，便会重新审视中国社会中许多普遍的选择。

<p class="english-text">If we can only see people's economic needs, physiological needs, I can't see because I can't know myself, unable to express true self, the mental pain caused, would mistakenly underestimate the importance of personality. As a result, individuals are either in some hidden places paid an extra price, or transfer this cost to others. When we consider this high opportunity cost, will reconsider many choices that are common in Chinese society.</p>
</details>

近年来，面对中国社会的**内卷**（Involution: 指非理性的内部竞争或过度竞争，导致个体付出巨大努力却收益甚微的现象）和高压氛围，越来越多的人开始关注内心和精神的解放。这体现在舆论中心理学话语的比例不断增加。一些与心理学相关的概念也层出不穷，成为热门网络词汇。然而，由于环境的影响，中国许多看似进步和解放的流行思潮，其核心存在严重问题，因此只能说是虚假的解放。那么关于这个话题，有很多值得探讨之处。在今天的视频中，我们来聊聊“**普通学**”（General Studies: 一种倡导接受自身平凡、不追求卓越以缓解社会压力的思潮）。

<p class="english-text">In recent years, more and more people, the involution of Chinese society and the high-pressure atmosphere, start to focus on inner and spiritual liberation. This is reflected in the proportion of psychological discourse in public opinion. Some concepts related to psychology are also constantly emerging, become a popular online term. But, due to the influence of the environment, many in China, popular ideas that seem progressive and liberating, there is a serious problem with its core. Therefore, it can only be said to be a false liberation. So about this topic, there are many things to talk about. In today's video, let's talk about "General Studies".</p>

<p class="english-text">Let me say one more thing before we start, if you are interested in today's video, or do you have any topic you want to discuss with me? You can contact my email to make an appointment. Let's get back to our topic today.</p>
</details>

### “普通学”的流行及其表象

“普通学”的流行可以追溯到2020年。由于疫情爆发和经济下行，越来越多的人从现实中感到无力和焦虑。2020年的十大热词中，“内卷”和“打工人”赫然在列。这种情绪反映在文章中：“时代真的变了。”往年我们听到的，仍然是洗脑式的“成功学”。但从去年开始，年轻人越来越接受“普通人”的现实。流行文化也开始宣扬“不完美”的“普通学”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Popularity of general studies dating back to 2020. Due to the outbreak and economic downturn, more and more people feeling powerless and anxious from reality. The top ten hot words in 2020, "Involution" and "Working People". This sentiment is reflected, as the article states: Times have really changed. Previous years, what we hear is still the brainwashing "success theory". But since last year, young people are increasingly accepting the reality of being an “ordinary person”. Popular culture also began to promote "imperfect" "ordinary studies".</p>
</details>

例如，豆瓣的普通学小组拥有超过7万名成员。该小组的公告写道：“我们习惯了被教育如何努力拼搏、成为一个成功人士。”“但很少有人告诉我们，在那之前，如何接受自己，如何做一个珍贵而快乐的普通人。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For example, Douban's general study group, more than 70,000 members. The group's announcement reads: We are used to being educated, how to strive for achievement, be a Successful Person. But few people tell us, before that, how to accept yourself, how to be a precious and happy ordinary person.</p>
</details>

在热门歌曲《平凡之路》中，有两句歌词：“直到看见平凡，才是唯一的答案。我曾经像你像他像那野草野花，绝望着，渴望着，哭着笑着，平凡着。”也正因为这首歌非常契合“普通学”的主题，因此在各大音乐App的评论区，许多网友也留下了类似的心声。例如，有人说：“人生有三个阶段：知道父母是普通人，知道自己是普通人，知道孩子是普通人。”在QQ音乐的评论区，一条获得万赞的评论写道：“年少轻狂，无所畏惧，憧憬未来，渴望优秀。后来发现不过是昙花一现，虚无一场。直到最后，看见平凡，大梦初醒。平凡之路，好像是我们每个人都要走的路。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the hit song "Ordinary Road", there are two lyrics: Until I see the ordinary, is the only answer. I'm just like you and him, like weeds and wildflowers, cry and laugh, ordinary clothes. Also because this song is very suitable for the theme of general studies, therefore, in the comment section of major music apps, many netizens also left similar sentiments. For example, someone said: "There are three stages in life: knowing that parents are ordinary people, know that I am an ordinary person, know that children are ordinary people". In the comment section of QQ Music, one comment with 10,000 likes said: "When I was young, I was reckless and fearless. Longing for the future, longing for excellence. Later I found it was like a flash in the pan, nothingness. Until the end, I saw the ordinary, awakening from a dream. Ordinary Road, it seems to be a path we all have to take.”</p>
</details>

这些话语揭示了一个含义：只有当一个人意识到自己的平凡与平庸，认识到成功的虚幻性，才能减少因妄想而产生的焦虑，与自己和解，接受自己的不完美。公众号“**真实故事计划**”（True Story Project: 一个专注于讲述真实人物故事的媒体平台）曾发表一篇文章《普通学，内卷年轻人的喘息之机》。文章讲述了这样一个故事：当事人从小到大一直都是学霸。在高中时，她承认一直考第一名让她上瘾。但进入**北京大学**（Peking University: 中国顶尖的综合性研究型大学之一）后，她别无选择，只能成为金字塔尖上的人。她觉得在学校不能有任何“无用”的爱好，时间不能浪费，不能走错一步。如果不学习，出去玩，就会被人背后议论“不务正业”。后来她发现，许多非名校出身的人也能过得很快乐。她开始学着接受并习惯自己的平凡，专注于当下的幸福，选择放大生活中微小瞬间的亮点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">These words, this reveals a meaning: Only when a person realizes his ordinariness and mediocrity, realize the illusory nature of success, to reduce the anxiety caused by delusions, to reconcile with oneself, accept your imperfections. Public Account True Story Project published an article "Ordinary Learning, a Respite for Involuted Young People". I told you this story. The person concerned has always been a top student since childhood. In high school, she admitted that always being first became addictive. But after entering Peking University, she has no other choice, become the person standing at the top of the pyramid. She felt, you can't have any useless hobbies in school. Time cannot be wasted. Don't take a wrong step. If you don't study, go out and play, people will talk about you behind your back. Not doing the right thing. Later she discovered that many people did not come from prestigious schools. You can also live happily. She began to learn to accept and get used to her ordinariness. Focus on the happiness of the present moment. Choose to amplify the highlights of the small moments in life.</p>
</details>

随着越来越多的人将“普通学”作为一种平复心情的方式，也有更多人参与到普通学内容的创作中。例如，**储殷**教授（Professor Chu Yin: 中国知名学者、辩论家）曾在某期关于“接受平庸很难吗？”的辩论节目中这样说：“平庸有什么不好？难道这个社会只容得下成功吗？难道这个社会对失败者太苛刻了吗？我过着普通人的生活，享受着简单人的快乐，我错了吗？我们为什么非要这么折腾？”据说这些话引起了广泛共鸣，也为他带来了不少粉丝。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As more and more people use "normal learning" as a way to calm your mood, there are more people participate in the creation of general academic content. For example, Professor Chu Yin once said in a certain issue about "Is it difficult to accept mediocrity?" In the debate show, said this: "What's wrong with being mediocre? Is this society only capable of success? Is this society too harsh on losers? I live a normal life, enjoy the happiness of simple people, am I wrong? Why do we have to go through all this trouble?" It is said that these words resonated widely. And it brought him a lot of fans.</p>
</details>

那么通过以上内容，我们可以总结，“普通学”主要是一种心理平衡的手段。它鼓励人们接受自身的平庸或有限性，试图消解成功与荣耀带给个体的心理压力。那么我们应该如何评价“普通学”呢？“普通学”真的能够缓解社会内卷的氛围，以及由此带来的焦虑和痛苦吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then through the above content, we can summarize, General learning is mainly a means of psychological balance. It encourages people to accept their own mediocrity, or finiteness, trying to dispel success and glory, psychological pressure on individuals. So how should we evaluate general studies? General Studies, can it really alleviate the social atmosphere of involution? What about the anxiety and pain caused?</p>
</details>

### 对“接受平庸”的批判性反思

事实上，我认为“接受你的平庸”这句话本身是荒谬的，非常缺乏批判性思维。经常看Anthony节目的朋友应该能感受到，我这个人更喜欢从纯粹思辨的角度去评估一个观点，然后再去寻找各种经验性的、实证性的证据。那么接下来我继续解释，为什么这句话是欠缺思考的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In fact, I think, “Accept your mediocrity”, this sentence itself is ridiculous, very lack of critical thinking. Friends who often watch Anthony's show should be able to feel, I am this person, I prefer to start from a purely speculative perspective, evaluate a point of view. Then it’s time to look for various experiences, empirical evidence. Then let me continue to explain, why is this sentence thoughtless?</p>
</details>

因为所谓的“平庸”，仅仅是普通、无意义、缺乏深度。它并不意味着优秀或杰出。接受你的平庸，意味着认识到自身本性就是平庸的、有限的。这就等同于将自我的所有无限性、超越性和内在目的性，全部消解掉了。然而，既然自我是无意义的，为什么要接受这种无意义呢？因为接受这个行为本身，就隐含着一种更高的意义体系和价值追求。这意味着当事人认为，接受平庸比不接受平庸更明智。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because the so-called "mediocrity", just ordinary, meaningless, lack of depth. It doesn't mean excellent or outstanding. Accept your mediocrity, it means realizing that one's own nature is mediocrity, limited. This is equivalent to taking all the infinity of the self, transcendence and intrinsic purpose, all dissolved. However, since the self is meaningless, why accept this meaninglessness? Because the act of acceptance itself, it implies a higher system of meaning, and the pursuit of value. This means that the parties believe, accepting mediocrity, it is better than not accepting mediocrity. More sensible.</p>
</details>

于是这里就出现了一个矛盾：因为如果你真的平庸，那么你接受与否根本无关紧要。这种悖论类似于一个**虚无主义者**（Nihilist: 认为生命、价值观和知识都是无意义的哲学立场）告诉别人一切都是无意义的。他还写了许多文章来证明这一点。然而，他这种行为本身，就隐藏着强烈的意义感，那就是说服他人“接受世界是无意义的”。而这恰恰是非常有意义的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here comes a contradiction, because if you are really mediocre, it doesn't matter whether you accept it or not. This paradox is similar to that of a nihilist, it's meaningless to tell others everything. He also wrote many articles to prove this point. However, his behavior itself, there is a strong sense of meaning hidden in it, that is to convince others to "accept that the world is meaningless". This is very meaningful.</p>
</details>

所以我们说，人要真正接受自身的有限性，只能是站在无限和超越的立场上。**黑格尔**（Hegel: 德国著名哲学家，德国古典哲学的集大成者）认为，有限的意义，只有在无限的语境下才能被真正理解。有限的痛苦、失败、脆弱，甚至平庸都不是绝对的。它们只是走向无限的必经之路。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we say, people need to truly accept their own limitations, it can only be standing on a position of infinity and transcendence. Hegel believes, limited meaning, it can only be truly understood in the context of infinity. Limited pain, failure, vulnerability, even mediocrity is not absolute. They are just necessary steps to move towards infinity.</p>
</details>

中国社会的主流评价体系，往往垄断了人们对无限、对神圣和超越的理解。这给许多人带来了心理焦虑。“普通学”试图通过拒绝和否定自身对超越的追求，来换取某种虚假的灵魂和解。但真正的和解，并非是放弃对普遍性和超越性的追求，而是要认识到，主流社会所倡导的超越，也许只是一种虚假的超越。所以当你选择放弃迎合某些世俗的评价标准时，这并不意味着我接受了自己的平凡，而更大的可能性是，他们在追求真正的卓越。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The mainstream evaluation system in Chinese society, often monopolizes people's understanding of infinity, understanding of the sacred and transcendent. It caused psychological anxiety for many people. General studies attempt to pass, reject and deny your own pursuit of transcendence, in exchange for some kind of false reconciliation of the soul. But true reconciliation, it is not to give up the pursuit of universality and transcendence. But to realize, transcendence advocated by mainstream society, maybe it's just a false transcendence. So when you choose to give up, cater to certain secular evaluation standards, it doesn't mean that I accept my own ordinariness. It is more likely that they are pursuing true excellence.</p>
</details>

### 主流评价体系下的“平庸”与“卓越”

例如，我记得**清华大学**（Tsinghua University: 中国顶尖的综合性研究型大学之一）曾经公布过一份某位同学的作息表。据说这位同学每天只睡5个小时，日程排得满满当当，要么在上课，要么在复习。字迹也写得非常工整。每一个行动，都完美符合学校设定的优秀标准。因此，他获得了各种荣誉。大多数同学因此感到焦虑，因为他们觉得自己太普通了，做不到这种内卷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For example, I remember Tsinghua University, I once published a classmate's schedule. It is said that this student only sleeps 5 hours a day, a packed schedule, either in class or reviewing. The handwriting is also very neat. Every action, they all perfectly meet the excellent standards set by the school. Therefore, he has received various honors. Most students feel anxious. Because they feel too ordinary. I can't do this kind of roll.</p>
</details>

然而在我看来，这种所谓的优秀才是真正的平庸。因为这实际上是另一种方式的重复高中生活。清华大学宣传这种字迹工整、争分夺秒的所谓良好学风，只能说明中国大学领导者的管理模式和审美标准，也十分平庸。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, in my opinion, this so-called excellence is the real mediocrity. Because this is actually another way, repeating high school life. Tsinghua University promotes this kind of neat handwriting, the so-called good study style of racing against time, can only explain, Management Model and Aesthetic Standards of Chinese University Leaders, also very mediocre.</p>
</details>

实际上，我在大学里遇到过许多学霸和天才，他们给我的感觉是这样：他们努力在每一门科目上获得高分，却不追求对这些知识有深入的理解，缺乏自己的见解和兴趣。如果通过刷往年试卷就能考过、获得高分，他们就不会花更多时间去深入思考这些知识。那些真正追求对概念有深入理解的学生，往往无意迎合一些无意义的、枯燥的考核或指标，结果在整体评价中，反而落后于那些不求甚解的学生。因此，许多现有的评价体系和秩序，存在严重问题，甚至会逆向淘汰。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Actually, I met many top students and geniuses in college. Gives me this feeling. They strive to get high scores in every subject. But I don't seek to have a deep understanding of this knowledge. Lack of own opinions and interests. If an exam can be passed by reviewing past exam papers, if you get a high score, they won’t spend more time, think deeply about this knowledge. Those who truly pursue, students who have a deep understanding of the concepts, often have no intention to cater to some meaningless, boring assessments or indicators. Results in overall evaluation, instead, they fall behind those students who do not understand the. Therefore, many existing evaluation systems and orders, there are serious problems, even reverse elimination.</p>
</details>

考虑到中国学生通常缺乏自由时间，因此，如果一个中国学生进入大学后，对大学评价体系普遍存在的形式主义和官僚主义毫无察觉，甚至能够游刃有余地融入其中，而不感到无聊或不公，不觉得生命被浪费，这并不意味着他更优秀，拥有更好的适应性，我只能说，他可能缺乏自由思考和探索的空间。他的无聊耐受度如此之高，以至于没有能力感知到这种评价体系的荒谬性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Considering that Chinese students usually lack of free time, therefore, if a Chinese student enters university, the university evaluation system is generally formalism and bureaucracy are completely unaware, even blending in effortlessly. Rather than feeling bored or unfair, and life is wasted, this doesn't mean he's better. Better adaptability, I can only say, he may have, lack of space for free thinking and exploration. His boredom tolerance is so high. No ability to perceive, the absurdity of this evaluation system.</p>
</details>

我相信大家还记得，在11月30日和12月1日两期讨论教育的视频中，提到人天生偏爱新鲜和丰富的刺激，厌倦贫瘠和无聊。然而，如果人长期处于一个枯燥、单调、封闭的环境中，反而可能因为**习得性无助**（Learned Helplessness: 指个体在经历多次失败和挫折后，即使有机会成功也放弃尝试的一种心理状态），而逐渐习惯了无聊，甚至变得害怕丰盛和多样性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I believe everyone still remembers, In the two episodes on November 30 and December 1, videos discussing education, mentioned, People naturally prefer fresh and rich stimulation. Tired of poverty and boredom. However, if people stay in, in a boring, monotonous and closed environment, instead, it may be due to learned helplessness, and gradually got used to boredom. Even become afraid of abundance and diversity.</p>
</details>

许多中国高中生进入大学后，虽然没有了高中时期的僵硬束缚，但他们会自发地重复高中生活，不加反思地刷题，考试分数会。他们认为，虽然我不知道自己真正想做什么，但在迷茫的时候，去卷分数总比不卷而落后要好。这确实看似是一种理性的策略，但它也是短视的。被恐惧裹挟的当事人，做出了短期理性的选择，从长远来看，却显得非常不理性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Many Chinese high school students enter college, although there is no rigid restraint like in high school, but they will spontaneously repeat their high school life. Do the questions without reflection, and the test score will be. They think, even though I don’t know what I really want to do, but when you are confused, go to the test point, it's better than not rolling and falling behind. This does seem like a rational strategy. But it is also short-sighted. Wrapped in fear, the parties make short-term rational choices. In the long run, it's very irrational to see.</p>
</details>

所以，拥有高无聊耐受度并非一件好事。许多活跃的头脑，往往难以坚持做无意义的事情。但在中国，许多人所欣赏的，却是机械地执行指令的能力，能够适应任何严苛的环境，而不感到丧失自我的痛苦。但这种能力从另一个角度来看，恰恰是一种残疾的表现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, having a high tolerance for boredom is not a good thing. Many active minds, often find it difficult to stick to meaningless things. But in China, many people appreciate, it is the ability to execute commands mechanically. Able to adapt to any harsh environment, without feeling the pain of losing oneself. But this ability can be viewed from another perspective, it is precisely a manifestation of disability.</p>
</details>

在中国学校的主流评价体系下，那些追求深度思考、更具批判性和反思精神的学生，反而常常感到空虚、痛苦和怀疑。结果这些情绪影响了他们的世俗行为，导致他们被认为是平凡和平庸的。但事实可能恰恰相反。喜欢思考、追求深度，这恰恰是一种优秀的特质。在一个鼓励个性和独立思考的社会环境中，这些特质会受到周围人的欣赏，给予当事人继续自我探索的勇气，最终发展出可见的世俗能力。而在中国，许多拥有这些特质的人，却不得不生活在被贬低和审视的境地。结果，还没达到世俗成就的程度，就因为内耗而陷入了长期的焦虑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Under the mainstream evaluation system of Chinese schools, those who pursue deep thinking, students who are more critical and reflective, instead, I often feel emptiness, pain and doubt. As a result, these emotions affect their worldly behavior. Causes them to be considered ordinary and mediocre. But the opposite may be true. Like to think, pursue depth, this is precisely an excellent trait. In a society that encourages individuality, and a social environment of independent thinking, these traits will be appreciated by those around you. Give the client the courage to continue self-exploration. Eventually developed visible worldly abilities. In China, many people who possess these traits, you have to live in a situation where you are degraded and scrutinized. Result, I haven't yet reached the point of worldly achievement. Because of internal friction, I fell into long-term anxiety.</p>
</details>

### 真正的精神解放：批判虚假卓越，重建自我认同

我相信内在和外在的成就，最终应该是统一的。如果我们谈论成功，将外在成就视为神圣和超越的目标，将人简化为“可以被量化的机器”，忽视内在价值和尊严。那么“普通学”的问题在于，它直接否定了人类对超越的追求，将人的有限性本质化。但这仍然受限于成功学的逻辑框架，缺乏真正的独立性。它仍然默认了世俗评价体系的合法性前提。所以这种内心的平静，是脆弱而虚假的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I believe in inner and outer achievement. Eventually, it should be unified. If we talk about success, view external achievement as a sacred and transcendent goal. Simplifying people into "machines that can be quantified", ignoring intrinsic value and dignity. So the problem with general studies is, directly denies the pursuit of human transcendence. Essentializing human limitations. But this is still limited by the logical framework of success studies. Lack of real independence. It is still the default, the legitimacy of the secular evaluation system, premise. So this peace of mind, is fragile and false.</p>
</details>

一旦社会环境的压力增大，“普通学”带来的心理慰藉便会轻易被击溃，个体将再次陷入焦虑。即使个体觉得自己已经接受了平凡，然而，当朋友、家人、同事等仍然用世俗标准来评判他时，他仍然需要花费更多精力，在心理层面与这种评价抗争。归根结底，人是不可能接受自己的平庸的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Once the pressure of social environment increases, the psychological comfort brought by ordinary learning can be easily defeated. The individual will again fall into anxiety. Even if individuals feel, I have accepted my ordinariness. However, when friends, family, colleagues, etc., when we still use secular standards to judge him, he still needs to spend more energy, fight this evaluation on a psychological level. The bottom line, it is impossible for people to accept their own mediocrity.</p>
</details>

中国人很容易通过消灭自由，来解决缺乏自由的问题。通过自我否定，来解决无法发展自我的痛苦。回归到生命早期的状态，将其美化为更高层次的进步和境界。将个性的缺席，视为更高层次的个性。但这只是一种心理安慰，而非真正的力量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is easy for Chinese people to destroy freedom, to solve the problem of lack of freedom. Use self-denial, to solve the pain caused by the inability to develop oneself. Return to the early days of life, beautify it into a higher level of progress and realm. Viewing the absence of personality as a higher level of personality. But this is just a kind of psychological comfort, rather than a real force.</p>
</details>

因此，真正的精神解放，绝非是不受世俗评价体系的影响，仅仅在内心寻求平静与和解。相反，精神解放意味着精神必须主动地去批判和解构那些虚假的卓越。其目的是建立一个真正普世的评价体系。在此原则下，个体可以从自身经验出发，揭示超越性事件，构建新的自我认同。以此为纽带，寻找到新的人际关系。在这个共同体内部，人与人之间都认可彼此人格的独立性。因此，个体得以永远克服旧环境被碾压和吞噬的恐惧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Therefore, true spiritual liberation, it is by no means untouched by the secular evaluation system. Just seek peace and reconciliation within yourself. On the contrary, spiritual liberation means that the spirit must take the initiative, to criticize and deconstruct those false excellences. The purpose is, to establish a truly universal evaluation system. Under this principle, individuals can draw on their own experiences, uncovering transcendental events. Build a new self-identity. Use this as a link to find new interpersonal relationships. Within this community, people and People, they both recognize the independence of each other's personality. Therefore, individual, and thus forever overcome the old environment, fear of being crushed and swallowed up.</p>
