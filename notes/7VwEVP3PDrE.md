title: 以色列-哈马斯停火能否持续？和平之路面临的挑战
---

### 停火协议的现状与前景

上个月，当以色列和哈马斯达成停火协议时，一位总理曾这样表示：

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When Israel and Hamas agreed to the ceasefire last month, here's a bit of what a Prime Minister had to say.</p>
</details>

“这是一个充满希望的日子。我们备受鼓舞，备受鼓舞。但这只是第一阶段，未来还有更多工作要做。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"It is a day for optimism. We're encouraged, we're encouraged. But it's the first phase, and there's more to come."</p>
</details>

那么，停火协议是否仍在维持？实现持久和平的可能性有多大？接下来会发生什么？我就此采访了**约翰·艾伦**（John Allen），他曾担任加拿大驻以色列和西班牙大使，目前是多伦多大学**比尔·格雷厄姆当代国际历史中心**（Bill Graham Centre for Contemporary International History: 专注于研究当代国际历史的学术机构）的高级研究员。约翰，欢迎来到节目。你最近怎么样？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, is the ceasefire holding? What are the chances of a lasting peace, and what comes next? I asked John Allen, former Canadian ambassador to Israel and Spain and a senior fellow at the University of Toronto's Bill Graham Centre for Contemporary International History. John, welcome to the program. How are you doing?</p>
</details>

约翰·艾伦回应道：“很好。谢谢邀请我。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"Good. Thanks for having me."</p>
</details>

主持人：“好的。我想谈谈停火协议。许多人可能会将其描述为脆弱的。我们目前处于什么阶段？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"All right. I want to talk about the ceasefire. Many would describe it as maybe a fragile one. Where are we at right now with it?"</p>
</details>

约翰·艾伦：“我认为这是一个很好的描述。停火协议本应伴随着哈马斯的解除武装，然后是**以色列国防军**（IDF: Israel Defense Forces，以色列的军事力量）的撤离，以及在所有被扣押人员（无论生死）被送回以色列后，大量人道主义援助的涌入。一旦巴勒斯坦囚犯被释放，我们仍在努力。我们还有八名已故的被扣押人员尚未送回。坦率地说，这是预料之中的，因为很难找到并收集所有这些人。许多人被埋在废墟下。正如我们所知，上周发生了一些暴力事件。两名以色列人遇袭时，有100名巴勒斯坦人被杀。哈马斯否认他们直接参与了这些事件。那里有不同的部族，也有反叛的哈马斯组织。所以情况非常复杂，我们只能希望停火能够维持。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"I think that's a good description. You know, the ceasefire was supposed to be followed by disarming of Hamas and then a withdrawal of the IDF and a big flow of humanitarian assistance once the hostages, both dead and alive, were delivered back to Israel. And once the Palestinian prisoners were released, we're still working. We have eight deceased hostages that are yet to come back. And frankly, that was expected because it's very difficult to find them all and to gather them all. And many are under rubble. And as we know, there was some violence over the last week. 100 Palestinians were killed when two Israelis were hit. Hamas, you know, denies that they were directly involved. There are clans. There are rebel Hamas. So it's very complicated, and we're just hoping that it will hold."</p>
</details>

### 停火的脆弱性与挑战

主持人：“许多人可能想知道，如果仍然存在交火，我们怎么能称之为停火呢？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"Many people are probably wondering, how do we call this a ceasefire if there are still exchange of gunfire?"</p>
</details>

约翰·艾伦：“是的。我认为这是可以预料的。目前的情况是，**以色列国防军**（IDF）继续控制着**加沙地带**（Gaza Strip: 位于地中海东岸，巴勒斯坦领土的一部分）53%的区域，而哈马斯和那里的各种部族（其中一些是反哈马斯的）则控制着另外47%的区域。所以，双方军队并没有完全分离。在以色列国防军控制的区域内，仍有哈马斯武装分子。过去几天有迹象表明，他们正试图撤离。以色列国防军和其他方面正在**国际红十字会**（ICRC: International Committee of the Red Cross，一个独立的人道主义组织）的帮助下，努力找出如何让他们撤离。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"Yeah. Well, I think this is to be expected. You've got a situation where the IDF continues to control 53% of the Gaza Strip and Hamas and these various clans that are there, some of them who are anti-Hamas are in the other 47%. So you don't have a complete separation of forces. There are still Hamas militants in the area controlled by the IDF. And there's some suggestion over the last couple of days that they're trying to get out. And the IDF and, and others are trying to figure out how to get them out with the help of the ICRC, the Red Cross."</p>
</details>

### 和平计划的下一步

主持人：“我们来谈谈和平计划。这是由美国促成的，包含20个步骤。我们稍后会深入探讨。但接下来会发生什么？我们之前谈到了一些关于被扣押人员的问题。看起来这不会是一步完成的。一旦这个步骤完成，下一个步骤就会发生。似乎存在一些交叉。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"Let's talk the peace plan. This was brokered by the US. There are 20 steps. We'll get into that. But what is set to take place next? We talked a little bit about hostages. It doesn't seem like it's going to be. Once this step is done, this step will happen. It seems like there is a bit of sort of crossover."</p>
</details>

约翰·艾伦：“是的，确实如此。正如我提到的，接下来的步骤实际上是解除哈马斯的武装，因为以色列国防军表示，在哈马斯解除武装之前他们不会撤离，而哈马斯则表示，在以色列国防军撤离之前他们不会完全解除武装。现在有讨论，就像北爱尔兰和平计划中那样，哈马斯放弃重型武器，或许保留轻型武器，主要用于在加沙内部自卫。这是一种可能的选择。但人道主义援助的流动并没有达到应有的程度。它本应由联合国最初的机构和当地的非政府组织来完成，但那里似乎也存在问题。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"Yeah, there definitely is. The next steps, as I mentioned, are really the disarming of Hamas because the IDF says they won't withdraw until Hamas disarms, and Hamas says that it's not going to fully disarm until the IDF withdraws. There's now talk, as there was in the in the peace plan for Northern Ireland, of Hamas giving up its heavy weapons and perhaps retaining its lighter weapons, essentially to defend itself within Gaza. That's a possible option. But the humanitarian assistance is not flowing as much as it should be. It was supposed to be done by the original UN agencies and the NGOs that are on the ground, but there seems to be a problem there as well."</p>
</details>

主持人：“没有给出这个过程需要多长时间的时间表。在所有人的目光都集中在第19和20步——加沙的重建和共存协议——之前，还需要多长时间？如果仍然存在交火，就无法真正进行重建。但我们是否知道他们希望这何时发生？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"No timelines given for how long this will take. How long before I think all eyes are really on step 19 and 20, which is the rebuilding of Gaza and the agreement to coexist can't really have a rebuild if there is still exchange of fire. But do we have a sense of when they would like this to happen?"</p>
</details>

约翰·艾伦：“嗯，第二阶段的下一步是在加沙地带引入法治，这本应由一支国际**稳定部队**（Stabilisation Force: 旨在维持地区和平与秩序的国际军事或警察力量）来完成，并且是在哈马斯解除武装和以色列国防军撤离的情况下进行。只要以色列国防军仍旧掌控局势并随时准备开火，这支部队就不会进入。我们与哈马斯之间的问题仍在持续。当然，我们也希望**联合国安理会**（UN Security Council: United Nations Security Council，联合国的主要机构之一，负责维护国际和平与安全）能通过一项决议来认可这一切。然后，应该由一个巴勒斯坦**技术官僚政府**（technocratic government: 由非选举产生的专家和技术人员组成的政府）来管理日常事务。同时，由**唐纳德·特朗普**（Donald Trump）和**托尼·布莱尔**（Tony Blair）领导的监督委员会负责提供监督。所以，我们有很多变数，而在联合国安理会决议和部队进驻这些重大下一步方面，尚未有任何进展。巴勒斯坦人正在接受训练，巴勒斯坦警察。这是好事。所以，一些事情正在幕后发生，但很难看到一个可以确定的时间表。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"Well, the next steps in phase two are to bring rule of law into the Gaza Strip, and that was to be done by an international Stabilisation Force, and that was to be done with a disarmed Hamas and to withdrawn IDF. That force is not going to come in while the IDF is still very much in control and ready to start shooting if they have to. And we have continuing issues with with Hamas. Of course, we also want a UN Security Council resolution to bless all this. And then what is supposed to happen is a Palestinian technocratic government is supposed to come in and manage the day to day. While this oversight board, led by Donald Trump and Tony Blair, is supposed to provide oversight. So we've got a lot of moving parts and nothing has happened in terms of that big next step of of getting the UN Security Council resolution and getting a force in. Palestinians are being trained Palestinian police. That's good. So things are happening in the background but very difficult to to see a timeline that you could fix on."</p>

### 国际社会与外部压力

主持人：“你能帮助我们理解，以色列政府和哈马斯都批准了这项计划。他们审阅了20个要点，并真诚地同意了。有没有任何一方会拖延它的理由？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"Can you help us understand, you know, the Israeli government approved this plan, as did Hamas. They had looked at the 20 points. They had agreed to it in good faith. Is there any reason why any side would be delaying it?"</p>
</details>

约翰·艾伦：“我想我会质疑‘真诚’这个说法。**本雅明·内塔尼亚胡**（Bibi Netanyahu）是被**唐纳德·特朗普**（Donald Trump）强迫签署这项计划的，特朗普在纽约与多个阿拉伯和穆斯林国家达成了协议，他有自己的理由希望这些人站在他这边。而哈马斯则是在卡塔尔、土耳其以及某种程度上埃及的压力下被迫接受的。我不认为任何一方会主动同意这项计划。我们面临的情况是，以色列尚未完全实现其目标，哈马斯仍在地面上。他们已经找回了被扣押人员，但哈马斯也未实现其目标，即以色列完全撤军，然后他们才会放弃武器。所以，坦率地说，这两方并没有真正深入投入到推动这项计划中。真正希望这项计划继续推进的是唐纳德·特朗普、美国军方和国际社会。如果这项计划要成功，特朗普及其团队将不得不持续施压。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"It's I guess I would question the phrase in good faith. Bibi Netanyahu was forced to sign this plan by Donald Trump, who had worked it out with various Arab and Muslim nations in New York, and he has his own reasons for wanting to keep those people onside. And Hamas was forced into it by Qatar and Turkey and to some extent by Egypt. I don't think either side would have agreed to the plan themselves to this plan. And we have a situation where Israel hasn't fully achieved its aims. Hamas is still on the ground. They have the hostages back and Hamas hasn't achieved its aims, which was full Israeli withdrawal and will give up our arms. So those two sides are frankly not deeply invested in this thing going forward. It's Donald Trump and the US military and the international community that really wants this to keep going. And Trump and company will have to keep the pressure on if it's going to succeed."</p>
</details>

主持人：“这是否能让国际社会相信停火会持续下去，即使它是由西方大国或唐纳德·特朗普政府维系的？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"Does that give us an international community faith that this will hold, even if it's being held by, say, the Western powers or Donald Trump's government?"</p>
</details>

约翰·艾伦：“我不会把你的房子押在这上面。我认为前进的道路上存在许多障碍和挑战。我是一个乐观主义者，我非常希望它能持续下去，并进入另一个阶段。我认为我们必须记住，这并非以色列-巴勒斯坦冲突的终结。**约旦河西岸**（West Bank: 位于约旦河以西，巴勒斯坦领土的一部分）的局势仍在持续。定居点在扩张，暴力事件大规模发生，而**本雅明·内塔尼亚胡**（Bibi Netanyahu）已经明确表示，他对**两国方案**（two-state solution: 解决以巴冲突的政治方案，主张建立独立的巴勒斯坦国与以色列国并存）不感兴趣，这正是第19和20点所指的，即为巴勒斯坦人自决提供一条途径。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"I wouldn't bet your house on it. I think there are many, many obstacles and challenges in the way. I'm a glass half full person, and I desperately hope that it will hold and that will move into another phase. I think we have to remember that this is not the end of the Israel-Palestine conflict. What's happening in the West Bank continues. There's settlement expansion, there's violence at a large scale, and Bibi Netanyahu has made it clear that he's not interested in the two-state solution, which is that point 19 and 20, where there's a pathway to Palestinian self-determination."</p>
</details>

### 和平前景与未来展望

主持人：“我想你刚才提到了一点。我想更好地了解周边国家，特别是埃及、卡塔尔、土耳其和西方政府的参与。你谈到了特朗普将与布莱尔一起担任监督者，但那三个国家，他们将在地面上做什么？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"I want to you touched on a little bit. I want to get a better understanding of the involvement of the surrounding nations, specifically Egypt, Qatar, Turkey and the Western governments. You talk about sort of the overseers that Trump will be with Blair, but those three nations, what will they be doing on the ground?"</p>
</details>

约翰·艾伦：“是的，他们将与美国人一起进行监督。他们将持续向哈马斯施压，要求其履行协议。同时，特朗普则向**本雅明·内塔尼亚胡**（Bibi Netanyahu）及其执政联盟中的弥赛亚主义部长们施压。他们不一定会成为稳定部队的一部分。那支部队显然将由印度尼西亚、阿塞拜疆，也许还有**阿联酋**（UAE: United Arab Emirates，阿拉伯联合酋长国）等其他国家组成，埃及人也可能参与其中。我认为土耳其不会参与，因为以色列不会允许土耳其在那里。所以，他们是监督者。他们是我们赖以确保哈马斯在此事中保持诚信的力量。希望他们能够成功。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"Yes, they're going to be monitoring along with the Americans. They're going to be keeping pressure on Hamas to fulfill its side of the bargain. While Trump keeps pressure on Bibi Netanyahu and the messianic ministers in his coalition, they are not necessarily going to be a part of the Stabilisation Force. That apparently is going to be Indonesia, Azerbaijan, perhaps the UAE, others, maybe the Egyptians there. I don't think Turkey, because Israel wouldn't have Turkey there. So they're they're the oversight. They're the ones that we rely on to keep Hamas honest in this. And hopefully they'll be able to succeed."</p>
</details>

主持人：“为什么这项计划会成功，而历史上没有一项计划真正取得进展？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"Why would this plan work when historically, none have ever really progressed?"</p>
</details>

约翰·艾伦：“原因与双方接受这项计划的原因相同，因为**唐纳德·特朗普**（Donald Trump）希望它成功。他在维持海湾国家和某些阿拉伯国家、土耳其的支持方面投入巨大。他在那里有巨额投资，并希望有更多。他确实让被扣押人员获释，这是他议程的一部分。但这真的将取决于特朗普是否能保持专注，以及国务卿**马可·卢比奥**（Marco Rubio）是否能持续施压。我认为我们必须希望以色列能举行另一次选举，而且会有的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"For the same reason that the plan was accepted by both sides because Donald Trump wants it to work. He's got a huge investment in keeping the Gulf states and certain Arab states, Turkey, onside. He's got huge investments there and wants more. And he did get the hostages out, which was part of his agenda. But it's really going to be dependent on Trump staying focused. Wittkopf Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, keeping the pressure on. And I think we're going to have to hope that there's another election in Israel, and there will."</p>
</details>

主持人：“必须在明年十月之前。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"Has to be before October next year."</p>
</details>

约翰·艾伦：“没错。如果举行选举，如果出现另一个政府，那么我的乐观情绪，这种谨慎的乐观情绪可能会上升，因为我认为另一个政府可能更愿意看到停火协议得以维持，并最终看到一个巴勒斯坦政府在没有哈马斯的情况下管理加沙。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"Exactly. And if there is an election and if there's another government, then my optimism guarded optimism might go up because I think another government might be more interested in in seeing the cease fire hold and in seeing a Palestinian government eventually come in there and try and rule Gaza without Hamas."</p>
