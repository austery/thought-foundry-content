### 《纽约时报》2025年度图书榜单出炉

**Gilbert Cruz:** 大家好，我是《纽约时报书评》的编辑吉尔伯特·克鲁兹，欢迎收听本期书评播客。是时候了，又到了一年一度的年度最佳图书盘点时刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello, I'm Gilbert Cruz, editor of the New York Times book review and this is the book review podcast. It is time. It's time for our best books of the year episode.</p>
</details>

**Gilbert Cruz:** 我们每年都会评选十本好书，五本虚构类，五本非虚构类。所以这期节目内容会格外丰富，就像一块双层夹心的奥利奥饼干，充满了关于书籍的对话。稍后，几位编辑将和我一起讨论年度非虚构类图书。但首先，我们将与戴夫·金和朱曼·卡蒂布一起探讨年度最佳虚构类作品。戴夫，欢迎。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How many books? We have 10 books as we do every year. Five fiction, five non-fiction. This is going to be an extra full episode. It's going to be like a double stuffed Oreo of book conversation. Later on, I'm going to be joined by several editors to talk about our non-fiction books of the year, but we are going to start with Dave Kim and Juman Katib here to talk about the best fiction of the year. Dave, welcome.</p>
</details>

**Dave Kim:** 你好，吉尔伯特。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Hello, Gilbert.</p>
</details>

**Juman Katib:** 你们好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hi, Jima. Hello. Hello.</p>
</details>

**Gilbert Cruz:** 去年我们录这期节目时，不知道你们是否还记得，我们三个人前一晚刚参加完美国国家图书奖颁奖典礼，都感觉昏昏沉沉的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So last year when we did this episode, I don't know if you recall, but the three of us had been at the National Book Awards the night before and were feeling very hazy.</p>
</details>

**Juman Katib:** 是的，当时我们的精力水平要低得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. Our energy level was much lower.</p>
</details>

**Dave Kim:** 希望我们今天能达到一个更高的水准。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hopefully we are going to hit a higher note today.</p>
</details>

**Gilbert Cruz:** 我想会的。好的，那么我们榜单上有五本书。在我们正式开始讨论之前，我先念一下书名和作者。它们分别是：基兰·德赛的《索尼娅与桑尼的孤独》、乔纳斯·哈桑·赫米里的《姐妹们》、丹尼尔·克劳斯的《天使坠落》、丹尼尔·克尔曼的《导演》以及夏洛特·伍德的《石院灵修》。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think so. Okay, good. So we have five books on this list and before we start our conversation in earnest, I'm going to read off the titles and the authors here. They are as follows. The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny by Kiran Desai. The Sisters by Jonas Hassen Khemiri. Angel Down by Daniel Kraus. The Director by Daniel Kehlmann. And Stoneyard Devotional by Charlotte Wood.</p>
</details>

### 年度虚构类图书五佳

#### 《石院灵修》(Stonyard Devotional) by Charlotte Wood

**Gilbert Cruz:** 朱曼，我想请你从我们今年年初讨论的一本书开始。听众朋友们，如果你们不知道的话，这是一个长达一年的过程。我们基本上从一月份，甚至更早的时候就开始展望，因为我们会拿到即将出版书籍的预读本和样书。我们每个月开会，然后每周开会进行辩论和讨论。夏洛特·伍德的《石院灵修》是今年年初的作品。你当时非常喜欢这本书，给我们讲讲吧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jima, I would love for you to start with one of the earliest books that we discuss this year. Listeners, for those of you who don't know, this is a year-long process. We start essentially in January, even a little bit before January looking ahead because we get advanced copies and galleys at books that are coming out and we meet every month and then every week to debate and discuss. Stoneyard Devotional by Charlotte Wood was early on in the year. Shimani, you were a big fan of this. Tell us about it.</p>
</details>

**Juman Katib:** 其实我一年多前就读了这本书，因为它入围了**布克奖**（Booker Prize: 英国文学界的重要奖项），当时在美国还没出版。所以我觉得部门里应该有人读一下，万一它获奖了呢。结果我完全被它折服了。这是一个关于中年女人的故事，她回到了自己成长的澳大利亚地区，去了新南威尔士州非常偏远的平原，探访一个修道院。这是一个令人惊讶的选择，她并非特别虔诚，尽管她有非常活跃的精神生活。实际上，她极度反对天主教会及其所谓的“野蛮行径”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I read this book actually over a year ago because it was shortlisted for the Booker and it hadn't yet come out in the States. So I felt like somebody in the department should read it in case it won and I was totally bowled over. So this is the story of a woman in midlife and she goes back to the area of Australia where she's from and she goes to the really remote plains of New South Wales and she goes to visit a convent. This is a surprising choice. She's not particularly religious, although she has a very active spirituality. She actually is extremely against the Catholic Church and its quote unquote savagery to use her term.</p>
</details>

**Juman Katib:** 基本上，她放弃了在悉尼丰富多彩的生活、婚姻、工作和朋友。她曾有过一次短暂的静修经历，并被那种她所需要的隐退感深深吸引，结果她在那儿待了更长的时间。这本小说的结构就像它的标题一样，像一本灵修日记。所以读起来几乎像日记或编年史。你知道，对于一个修道院来说，其实发生的事情还挺多的。有三个主要事件或三次主要“入侵”，我认为这些事件之所以感觉更强烈，是因为修道院本身就是与世隔绝的，所以任何形式的介入都显得很突兀。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And basically, she walked away from a full rich life, a marriage, a job, friends in Sydney. And she had one stint and was really lulled into this sense of retreat that she needed. and then she ends up staying for much much longer. So this novel is structured really like its title like a devotional. So it reads almost like a a diary or a chronicle. And you know for a convent there actually is quite a bit of action that happens. There are three main events or three main arrivals and I think that those are felt much more keenly just because a convent by definition is really cloistered. So any kind of interpolation is is jarring.</p>
</details>

**Juman Katib:** 首先是一场可怕的鼠灾。我的意思是，那简直是圣经级别的，老鼠无处不在。有一个疯狂的场景，老鼠在钢琴弦上，不是引擎盖下，弹奏着一种疯狂的音乐，那种声音萦绕在我脑海里，真的已经13个月了。这迫使修女们思考或重新考虑她们不造成任何伤害的承诺，因为当你有成千上万只老鼠时，你真的不能让它们在你的修道院里横行霸道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So first there is a horrific mouse infestation. I mean it's it's biblical. They're everywhere. There's a crazy scene about mice under the not under the hood on the piano strings playing this demented music that's haunting and has stayed with me literally for 13 months. And this really forces the sisters to think about or reconsider their commitment to doing no harm because there comes a point where you've got thousands of mice and you can't really let them run ramshod over your convent.</p>
</details>

**Gilbert Cruz:** 作为纽约市多套公寓的住户，这对你来说有共鸣吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Does this resonate with you as the occupant of multiple New York City apartments?</p>
</details>

**Juman Katib:** 我告诉你，这对我来说是很好的暴露疗法。我已经和蟑螂和解了。我认为蟑螂在害虫里算是比较“尊重人”的，老鼠则完全不是。至于大老鼠，我选择无视它们的存在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This was really good exposure therapy for me. I will tell you. I've I've made my piece with roaches. Roaches, I think, are almost respectful in terms of vermin. Mice are anything but. And rats, I don't acknowledge.</p>
</details>

**Dave Kim:** 我完全不同意。蟑螂很恶心。你一开灯，它们就跑了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I absolutely disagree. Roaches are gross. And no, they usually get out. I'm still terrified by Listen, you turn on the light, they get out.</p>
</details>

**Gilbert Cruz:** 我认为了解这本书的阅读体验很重要。有一点我觉得非常关键，我当时读这本书读得很快，因为我想：“天啊，万一这本书获奖了怎么办？”这是我们部门里所有人在必要时都会采取的一种阅读方式，就像吃饭不咀嚼，只是为了快速读完一本书。但几乎是立刻，在读了最初几篇日记后，我就放慢了速度，因为我意识到，这本书的语言有些特别之处，非常优美。有一句话来自叙述者的第一次静修，“这里的寂静如此浓厚，让我感到富有。”时隔13、14个月，我依然记得。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. I think this is just useful to know what you're going into. One thing that I think is incredibly important to keep in mind when you're reading this, I read this book pretty quickly because I was like, "God, what if this wins the book?" And this is a type of reading that I think all of us in the department do when we have to. It's like eating without chewing. You're just trying to like get through a book. Almost right away, like after the first couple entries, I slowed down to a normal pace because I was like, there is something going on with the language here that is really beautiful. There's a phrase from the narrator's first stint, the silence here is so thick it makes me feel wealthy. I remember 13 14 months after the fact.</p>
</details>

**Juman Katib:** 读者们，很抱歉我无法分享更多我喜欢的妙语，因为我那本划满重点的书神秘失踪了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now readers, I am sorry I cannot give you more of my favorite Bon Mo because my copy with all my underlines has mysteriously gone missing. But I</p>
</details>

**Gilbert Cruz:** 我们就不点名是《纽约时报》的哪位同事偷了你的书了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">we're not going to call out who at the New York Times has stolen your book.</p>
</details>

**Juman Katib:** 有人拿了我的书，我希望他们能像我一样从中获得乐趣。我绝对从这本书中学到了所有基督般的宽容信息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Somebody Somebody has my copy and I hope they got as much joy out of it as I did. Jamanna is so not bitter about it. No, I definitely took all the Christlike messages away from this book.</p>
</details>

**Gilbert Cruz:** 戴夫，你读过这本吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dave, you read this one?</p>
</details>

**Dave Kim:** 读过。是的，我喜欢它那种寓言式的结构：三个入侵者，三件她竭力想要隔绝于世却不断闯入的事情。她在这本书里的主要目标就是关闭世界，逃离社会，只反思内心。但世界却不断涌入，从未停歇。老鼠是最后一根稻草，对吧？那是一大波气候难民。它也确实有那方面的意味。但故事是从一些无害的事情开始的，比如一个死去修女的骸骨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I did. Yeah, I loved the sort of fablelike structure of it. the three invaders and the three things that that that try as she might. She's been her whole main goal in this is to shut out the world is to escape from society and to just reflect on what's within. And the world just keeps coming in and it doesn't, you know, let up. And the mice is the last straw, right? It's this huge wave of climate refugees essentially. I mean there is that sort of aspect of it too. But it starts with innocuous things, right? Just the bones of a dead naan.</p>
</details>

**Juman Katib:** 那也算无害？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's innocuous.</p>
</details>

**Dave Kim:** 无害在于它不会啃穿你的房子，对吧？无害在于它是一个无生命的物体，曾经有生命但现在没有了。从这个意义上说，这些事情开始瓦解她努力维护的东西，也就是她拼命寻求的内心平静。我喜欢这种结构，也喜欢它的基本前提。但我觉得，是它的执行力让这本书更上一层楼。它的写作非常出色，很有节制，描述优美且富有禅意，我非常喜欢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Innocuous in that it's not going to like chew through your house, right? Like innocuous in that it's an inanimate a formerly animate but now inanimate object. So, in that sense, but they start to to unravel what she worked hard to to preserve, which is this sort of inner peace that that she's so desperately seeking. And I love that structure. And I just love the idea, the basic premise of it. But the execution, I think, also brought it over the top for me. Like, it really it's great writing. It's disciplined writing. It's it's beautifully descriptive and meditative, and I loved it.</p>
</details>

**Gilbert Cruz:** 今年早些时候，我读了皮科·艾尔的一本非虚构回忆录，书名叫《火焰：从寂静中学习》。我在这档播客上采访过他，那是一本关于他几十年来探访加州大瑟尔一个本笃会隐修院的回忆录。他去那里已经超过30年了。我大概是同时读的这本书和《石院灵修》。戴夫和朱曼，你们对这本书的评价都是对的，文笔优美。主角想要与世隔绝的愿望深深吸引了我，以一种病态的方式吸引了我。但同时读这两本书真的让我很想去参加一次静默静修，我想这会是我2026年的计划。你们俩做过类似的事吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Earlier this year, I read a memoir, a piece of non-fiction by Pico Ayer. The title of that was A Flame Learning from Silence, and I interviewed him on this podcast, and it was a memoir about his visits over decades to a Benedicting hermitage in in Big Su, California. He's been going for more than 30 years. And I think I read this and Stoneyard devotional at around the same time. And everything you're saying about the book, Dave and Jumata, is correct. It's beautifully written. The main character is is inviting in how much to me she was inviting in how much she wanted to shut out the world and that appealed to me in some sick way. But reading these two books at the same time really made me want to go on a silent retreat and I think that is what is in store in 2026. Have either of you ever done anything like that?</p>
</details>

**Dave Kim:** 我经常去露营，但这完全不一样，因为我带着两个尖叫的孩子，他们会变得很野。所以那算不上逃离。但偶尔也会有可以拔掉插头、远离尘嚣的时刻，你的手机会没信号，你会感到与世隔绝，至少是短暂的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I go camping a lot. That's but it's actually no it's not like that at all because I have two screaming children with me who go ferals. Yeah, it's not quite an escape. But yeah, occasionally there are moments where you can unplug and get away. Your your phone goes out of service and you feel disconnected in at least briefly.</p>
</details>

**Juman Katib:** 我想我最接近的经历是长途飞行。我从不用机上Wi-Fi。首先，他们肯定在追踪我做的一切，我不需要让他们知道。而且，我喜欢在旅途中刻意失联的感觉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the closest I've come is like long airplane trips. You never hit the Wi-Fi? No. That's crazy. Okay, first of all, they're definitely tracking everything I do. I don't need them to know that. But also, I like the feeling of being intentionally out of reach while I'm in transit.</p>
</details>

**Gilbert Cruz:** 曾有一段时间我经常去一个佛教中心。它后来因为一场权力丑闻而彻底崩溃了，但我想它的教义还在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There was a time when I was going to like a Buddhist center pretty regularly. It has totally imploded under a a power scandal, but yeah, it's been a while. It's totally imploded, but I think the tenants remain, but</p>
</details>

**Juman Katib:** 你知道吗？我们都只是凡人，都有缺陷。真的，如果你想看看人性的脆弱，看看那个佛教团体发生了什么就知道了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know what? We're all just human and flawed. Truly, I mean really. If you want to see the fallibility of the human, just look at what happened at this Buddhist order.</p>
</details>

#### 《导演》(The Director) by Daniel Kehlmann

**Gilbert Cruz:** 刚刚我们聊的是夏洛特·伍德的《石院灵修》。戴夫，我想谈谈我们名单上的下一本书，丹尼尔·克尔曼的《导演》。这本书我今年推荐给了很多人。这不是吹牛，我只是想说，我夏天在特柳赖德参加电影节时，在书店里和一些人聊天，他们问我推荐什么书，自从我今年早些时候读了这本书后，它总是我第一个推荐的。其中一位女士当场就从书架上拿下买走了。它太棒了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That was Stoneyard Devotional by Charlotte Wood. Dave, I'd love to talk about the next book on our list, which is The Director by Daniel Kehlmann. This is a book that I've recommended to so many people this year. This is not a brag. I'm just going to say I was in Tellide this summer for the film festival and I was at the bookstore there and I was talking to a bunch of people and they asked me what book I should recommend and this is always always always the first book that I have since I read it early this year sort of uh given to people and one of the ladies went I think uh and took it off the shelf and bought it. It's so wonderful.</p>
</details>

**Dave Kim:** 发生这种事的时候感觉特别满足。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's very gratifying when that happens.</p>
</details>

**Gilbert Cruz:** 是啊。她可能后来回去退款了，心想“我才不听那个混蛋的”。给我们讲讲这本书吧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I know. I know. She probably went back afterwards got a refund. She was like I'm not going to listen to that jerk. Tell us about this one.</p>
</details>

**Dave Kim:** 是的，这是一本非常适合推荐的书，因为它能取悦很多不同类型的读者。克尔曼是那种少有的作家，既能为大众读者提供精彩内容——比如动作、生动的故事情节和人人都爱读的纳粹故事——又能为那些自命不凡、总说自己从不读当代小说的读者提供微妙之处、风格多样的文笔和闪耀的智慧。所以我觉得它能满足各种读者的需求。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it's such a great book to recommend because I think it would please so many different types of readers. He's the rare writer who can deliver the goods for a popular audience like have action and a lively plot and Nazis whom everyone loves to read about. But there's also this subtlety and the stylistic range and the bristling intelligence for that stuckup reader who's always telling you that he never reads contemp and it's always a man. Never. I never read contemporary fiction. This sort of arrogant reader that that I also am. And so I think it it really covers those bases. It's a great book to recommend to anyone.</p>
</details>

**Dave Kim:** 这本书讲述了奥地利电影制作人G.W.帕布斯特的生平与时代。他在默片时代凭借《潘多拉的魔盒》等影片取得了成功，这部电影是女演员露易丝·布鲁克斯的成名作。到了30年代，他声名鹊起，受邀前往好莱坞拍片，但他在那里格格不入，事业并不顺利。他决定返回欧洲，因为母亲病重，他想回去照顾她。但时机再糟糕不过了。希特勒上台，纳粹掌权，入侵波兰后迅速占领了欧洲，他被困在了那里，无法离开。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The book is about the life and times of GW Pabst who is an Austrian filmmaker who sees success in the silent era with films like Pandora's box which was a very popular vehicle for the actress Louise Brooks. is famous by the 30s and is invited to Hollywood to come and make movies for Hollywood and he's a fish out of water there. It doesn't really work out for him, but he's trying and he decides to go back to Europe because his mother is ailing and he wants to see her and take care of her. But the timing couldn't be worse. Hitler has come to power. The Nazis have taken over. after they've invaded Poland and end of quickly taking over Europe and he's stuck there. He can't leave.</p>
</details>

**Dave Kim:** 于是，他被困在了现在所谓的“东方边区”，基本上是为第三帝国拍电影。他与约瑟夫·戈培尔有过一次令人痛苦的会面，戈培尔告诉他“你可以做任何你想做的事，你有完全的自由”。当然，这与事实恰恰相反。他没有被强迫制作宣传片，但他报道任何政治性、带有社会信息的题材的能力都受到了极大的限制，并且在每个关头都被迫在艺术原则上做出妥协。这就是他发现自己所处的尴尬境地，故事由此展开。这本书精彩地描绘了一个时代和一个地方，但我认为最有趣的主题是围绕着艺术完整性与生存之间的核心张力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so now he is stuck in what is now called Ostark and working as a filmmaker essentially for the Reich. He has this harrowing meeting with Joseph Gobles who tells him you can do whatever you want. You're free to do anything. And of course that's exactly the opposite of what he says. He's not forced to make propaganda per se, but he definitely is hampered in his ability to cover anything political, anything with a social message and and is forced to compromise artistic principles at every juncture. So, this is a sort of awkward circumstances he finds himself in and the book goes from there. It's a wonderful portrait of a time and a place, but I think the best the most interesting themes are around this central tension between your artistic integrity and your life staying alive.</p>
</details>

**Gilbert Cruz:** 是的，还有他的家庭。他有一个年幼的儿子和妻子，他们一起回去了。妻子非常明智地反对回到他的家乡，她知道情况不妙。书中有一些场景，你可以看到儿子基本上被**希特勒青年团**（Hitler Youth: 纳粹德国的国家青年组织）拉拢，一个年轻人试图在这个世界上找到自己的出路。感觉通过这些角色，你能感受到在这样可怕的情况下，人们会有的不同反应——一种你必须与法西斯或独裁政权妥协的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And your family. And your family. Exactly. Yeah. Cuz he has a young son and a wife and they go back and the wife very wisely is against going back to his home. She knew what was up. And and there are scenes in which you see the son essentially being co-opted by the Hitler youth, a young person trying to sort of make his way through the world. Then it feels like through each of these characters, you get a sense of the different reactions that one would have to uh a terrible situation like this, a situation where you have to make compromises with a fascist or authoritarian regime.</p>
</details>

**Juman Katib:** 我认为这本书的场景设置非常出色。关于妻子的那一点，我印象最深刻的场景之一是她去参加一个读书会，与其他处境相似的艺术家妻子们在一起。对话非常夸张，而且很滑稽。那一刻的幽默感令人惊叹。我觉得这本书让我非常钦佩的一点是，克尔曼的掌控力非常强，以至于即使在那种压抑、令人窒息的大环境下，书中仍然有荒诞、幽默和轻松的时刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think the staging, you know, your point about the wife, one of the standout scenes in my mind is she's gone to a book club with other wives of artists who are in similar situations. And the dialogue is so over the top, and it's comedic. The humor of that moment is amazing to perceive. I think one of the things that I really admired about this book was how in control Kehlmann was to the point that there are moments of absurdity and humor and levity. I mean, he's still pulling at all these different modes even under this overarching oppressive airless environment.</p>
</details>

**Juman Katib:** 书的高潮部分做得非常出色。我读的时候有一种感觉，就像我小时候读一些我能理解字面意思，但显然还没准备好接受其情感后果的东西。我感觉自己读了不该读的东西。读这本书时我也有同样的感觉。这是我今年读过的最能触动情感的小说之一。为此，我还要特别感谢译者罗斯·本杰明。我之前就说过，在一个错误的手势或眼神接触，更不用说错误的词语，都可能带来灾难性后果的世界里，能够将一部文本带着所有这些细微差别翻译成英语，是一项真正的壮举。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the climax was, I think, so unbelievably well done. I actually had the feeling when I was reading it of like when I was a kid and I was reading something that I could comprehend the words, but I was clearly not ready for the emotional ramifications. You know, I was like reading something I wasn't really ready for. And I had that feeling reading this. It was one of the more emotionally affecting novels I've read this year. And for that, I really also credit the translator Ross Benjamin. I've said this before about this book, but when we're talking about a universe in which the wrong gesture or the wrong amount of eye contact, let alone the wrong word, can have disastrous consequences. I think being able to bring a text into English with all those nuances is a real feat.</p>

#### 《天使坠落》(Angel Down) by Daniel Kraus

**Gilbert Cruz:** 刚刚我们聊的是丹尼尔·克尔曼的《导演》。接下来我要谈一本我认为会有些争议，但我们书评部的许多人都非常热衷的书。这本书叫做《天使坠落》，作者是丹尼尔·克劳斯。这基本上是一本历史小说加恐怖小说。

<details>

<p class="english-text">That was the director by Daniel Kehlmann. I am going to talk about a book that I think will be somewhat divisive but but that many of us at the book review were pretty passionate about. It is a book called Angel Down by Daniel Kraus. This is essentially historical fiction/horror.</p>
</details>

**Gilbert Cruz:** 故事发生在一战期间。一群士兵在法国泥泞血腥的战壕里。在书的开头，他们听到了远处**无人区**（No Man's Land: 第一次世界大战中，指代敌对双方战壕之间的土地）传来的尖叫声。显然没人想去那里，因为你得趟过铁丝网和尸体，还要躲避另一边德国人的子弹。但他们奉命去制止尖叫，找到那个人，让他解脱。当他们到达那里时，奇幻元素出现了，他们发现那是一个天使，一个真正的堕落天使，一个女性天使。他们必须把天使带出来，并想办法处理她。这就是基本情节。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The basic story is it takes place during World War I. You have these group of soldiers in France in the muddy bloody trenches and at some point early on in the book they hear a screaming a wailing somewhere off in the distance in no man's land. Obviously no one wants to go there cuz you have to wade through barbed wire and corpses and the German bullets coming from the other side. But they are ordered to go stop the screaming, find this person and put them out of their misery. They get there and they find, this is where the fantastical elements come in, that it is a an angel. It is a genuine fallen angel, a female angel. Do angels have genders? I don't know. Female angel. They have to get the angel out of there and figure out what to do with her. That's the basic plot.</p>
</details>

**Gilbert Cruz:** 关于这本书还有几点需要了解。整本书基本上只有一个句子长，一个句子贯穿了近300页。据我回忆，每个短段落都以“and”这个词开头。它就像一系列永无止境的“and”陈述，一遍又一遍，全部串联成一个句子。另外一点是，这本书非常恶心。如果你读过丹尼尔·克劳斯之前的作品，或者至少读过他两年前出版的上一本书《鲸落》，你就会知道他可以写得非常恶心。那本书讲的是一个潜水员，他去寻找父亲的遗骸，结果被一头鲸鱼吞了下去，他必须想办法从鲸鱼体内出来。那个过程的描述极其逼真，充满了内脏。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There are a couple of other things to know about this book, which is that the entire book is essentially one sentence long. It is one sentence over almost 300 pages. And each short paragraph, as as far as I recall, begins with the word and. It's just a sort of a neverending series of and statements over and over again, all stitched together into one sentence. The other thing to know is that this book is very gross. And if you've read Daniel Kraus before, or at least if you read his last book, which was called Whalefall, came out two years ago. We put on the cover of the book review the summer it came out. Then you know he can be a very gross writer. That book, Whalefall, was about a scuba diver. He goes off to find his father's remains, which have his father died. He was also a scuba diver underwater off the coast of California. The son goes to find his dad's remains. He gets swallowed by a whale. And he has to make his way out of the whale. And he has to make his way out in incredibly visceral detail. And I'm using visceral here because there's a lot of viscera. These are very gushy books.</p>
</details>

**Gilbert Cruz:** 书里有很多黏糊糊的东西，很多血，你能想象到的一切。同样，《天使坠落》也极其恶心。作为一个热爱恐怖小说，并且能欣赏历史小说的人，我很惊讶地发现这两者在这本书里结合得如此之好。它不会是每个人的菜，但我认为这正是乐趣的一部分，也是我们书评部的责任之一：去发现一些人们没听说过、可能不合所有人胃口的书，并把它们推介出来。我希望我们通过《天使坠落》做到了这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's a lot of squaltching, a lot of squelching, a lot of blood, a lot just every everything you can imagine, right? The whale fall. It's not like Jeppetto and Pinocchio inside Monstro, a giant clean cathedral of the inside of a whale with the ribbones holding up the ceiling. This is some nasty nasty stuff. And in the same way, Angel Down incredibly nasty. I, as someone who loves horror, and I, as someone who can appreciate historical fiction, was surprised to find that they work so well together in this book. It's not going to be to everyone's taste, but I actually think it's part of the fun, and it's kind of part of our responsibility at the book review to find books sometimes that people have not heard of that may be not to everyone's liking and elevate them. And I think and I'm hoping that's what we're doing here with Angel Down.</p>
</details>

**Dave Kim:** 你是从读到第几个以“and”开头的段落时，才觉得“哦，这会是一本好书”的？你是一开始就知道吗？

<details>

<p class="english-text">At what paragraph starting with and or did you think, oh, we're in for a treat? Did you know like from the first page? Sometimes I have that with books that end up on this list.</p>
</details>

**Gilbert Cruz:** 很难确切地回忆起来，因为这本书里可能描述了人体每一个部位以某种方式与身体分离的情景。所以可能不是在主角脸上粘着耳朵的时候，因为那好像是在前几页，但也许是。可能还涉及到了牙齿。再说一遍，如果你觉得这本书不适合你，那也没关系。但我建议你给它一个机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's hard to remember exactly because it it is possible that every single body part that a person have is described in some way detached from the human body in this book. So, it may it wasn't when the main character has the ear plastered to his face cuz I think that's in the first few pages, but it might be. There might have been teeth involved. Again, if you think this is not for you, not for everyone, that's fine. But I say give it a chance.</p>
</details>

**Dave Kim:** 是的，这些描述中有些竟然能如此优美，这很了不起。这很奇怪，你怎么能读到关于斩首的描述，一些令人痛苦的场景，然后觉得，“哇，这可以被写成一个美丽的句子，或者句子的一部分。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. It's remarkable at how and this word is intentional. Beautiful some of these descriptions can actually be. It's bizarre. like how you can read something about decapitation, a description of something harrowing and and be like, "Wow, this can be made into a beautiful sentence or part of a sentence, I should say."</p>
</details>

**Gilbert Cruz:** 是的，他把战争故事这个最老套的历史小说题材之一，变成了一些意想不到的东西，这是一种好的惊喜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. There's a moment where he's holding somebody under the arms like a breach baby or something and it's like, "Okay." Wow. All right. All right. For my obstatrician friends out there, it is quite a performance. There are, as you say, descriptions and metaphors that I don't think I'd ever heard before. or of course they're attached to a war story which is one of the most stereotypical pieces of historical fiction that one can produce. But I think the way in which he takes the World War I story, the war story, the story about men dealing with their own mortality and the emptiness of the world and turns it into something unexpected was surprising in a good way.</p>
</details>

**Juman Katib:** 是的，我认为他确实让那个非常陈旧的比喻变得非常有趣。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah. And I thought he really did make that very tired trope very interesting.</p>

#### 《姐妹们》(The Sisters) by Jonas Hassen Khemiri

**Gilbert Cruz:** 刚刚我们聊的是丹尼尔·克劳斯的《天使坠落》。现在我要转向朱曼，谈谈一本非常不同的书。朱曼，我们部门里很少有人能像你一样，当你真正支持一本书时，会如此充满激情。《姐妹们》这本书你已经谈论了好几个月了。请告诉我们的听众这本书讲了什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that is Angel Down by Daniel Kraus. I am going to turn to Jumanna to talk about I don't know if it's the direct opposite of Angel Down cuz it's hard to describe Angel Down, hard to describe what the opposite would be, but it's something that is very different. And again, Jumanna, few people on the desk are as passionate about a book as you can be when you really get behind something. And the Sisters is a book that you've been talking about for months and months. Everybody's ready for this year to be over. All my colleagues are ready for this year to be over. I can tell. Well, we've all heard about the sisters a lot. So, please tell our listeners about it.</p>
</details>

**Juman Katib:** 就在我以为自己已经彻底告别**自传体小说**（Autofiction: 一种将自传与虚构相结合的文学形式）的时候，出现了一本自传体小说，彻底让我折服，并且在过去六个月里一直如此。这是一个关于米卡三姐妹——伊娜、伊芙琳和阿纳斯塔西娅的故事。她们是瑞典-突尼斯裔，这让她们在斯德哥尔摩成长的社区里显得与众不同，但她们之间的关系非常紧密。她们也成为了我们叙述者着迷的对象，叙述者也叫乔纳斯，也是瑞典-突尼斯裔，是作者本人的一个有点傻气、神经质、热情洋溢又抑郁的替身。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
p class="english-text">I heard you like this book, Jan. Yeah, I have I I'm working out my feelings about this book. So, just when I thought that I had really sworn off autofiction, there comes an autofictional novel that has totally knocked me sideways and I've stayed there for the last six months. So, This is the story of the Mika sisters, Ena, Evelyn, and Anastasia. They are Swedish Tunisian, which sort of sets them apart in the parts of Stockholm where they're growing up, but they are fiercely bonded and they are also the object of fascination for our narrator who is also named Yonas, who is also Swedish Tunisian and is a sort of goofy, neurotic, exuberant, depressive standin for the author himself.</p>
</details>

**Juman Katib:** 这本书相当长，但长度是有意为之的，而且读起来飞快。它有一个非常严格的结构：第一部分跨越一年，下一部分是六个月，然后时间跨度越来越短。我采访过作者，所以我知道他在创作时的一些内部构思。当你问一个作者“你创作时在想什么”时，他回答“哦，《战争与和平》”，这真的很有趣。但这个比喻其实很贴切，因为他是在一个巨大的画布上创作。这本书从斯德哥尔摩到突尼斯，再到德国，甚至纽约的金斯顿。它成功地容纳了如此多的生活，包括生活中非常低落的时刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So this book is one of the first things you'll see if you look at it if you look at a physical copy is that it is quite long and even that's not a bad thing. No, no, no. I'm agreeing with you. I think there's a the next book we're going to talk about is also long and we think that that's a good thing. And the length is intentional and it flies because I remember reading a little about this book and it has a very strict structure which is the first section covers one year then the next six months and then you know in decreasing amounts of time and I know I profiled the author so I know a lot or I know more about the sort of interior machinations he had when he was working on this and I do have to appreciate when you ask an author and you're like yeah what did you have in mind when you were working on this and he's like, "Oh, war in peace naturally, but it's actually apt in the sense that he's working on a huge canvas because this is a book that goes from Stockholm to Tunis to Germany to like Newalts or Kingston, New York. There is a bit of family lore about the Empire State Building. It just manages to contain so much life, including life's really low moments.</p>
</details>

**Juman Katib:** 我对这本书的核心设定非常兴奋。米卡姐妹有一个非常古怪的妈妈，她是一个突尼斯地毯商人，她几乎每六个月就让女孩们搬一次家。基本上，当她在一个社区卖完所有地毯后，她们就换地方。她告诉女儿们：“有人给我们下了诅咒，有人对我们下了邪眼。”所以女孩们一直在试图逃离这个诅咒。作者本人也说，他几十年来一直生活在被自己父亲诅咒的感觉中，而这本书是他将自己从中解脱出来的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's one of the most moving descriptions of being depressed or grief that you can feel. And I was very excited by the central conceit of this book, which is that the Mika sisters, they have a very eccentric mom who is a Tunisian carpet seller, and she makes a point of uprooting the girls almost like every six months. Basically, when I think she sold every carpet she can in a various neighborhood, they change neighborhoods. So she has raised her girls by saying, "Somebody's put a curse on us. Somebody's put the evil eye on us." And so the girls are trying to outrun this. And Chamir himself when we talked said, "I actually have been living, he's in his 40s. I have been living for decades with the feeling that I was cursed by my own father. And this book is the way that I wrote myself out of it.</p>

<p class="english-text">That's not true. That's not true. Let me tell you as as our sort of fertile crescent middle east correspondent, curses are very real, right? Like you just walk down Hamro Street. It's just they're real. You we'll just have to agree to disagree on that.</p>
</details>

**Gilbert Cruz:** 好的，很明显你对这本书有非常个人化的反应。我很想听听其他人的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, actually, that's a good point, though, because So, it's clear that I had a very visceral and personal reaction to this book. I would love to hear what somebody else thought about this book who did not necessarily recognize members of their extended family and the characters.</p>
</details>

**Dave Kim:** 我非常喜欢书中对姐妹们的刻画。她们的形象非常独立且丰满。她们作为角色，既能协同合作，又能相互对立。作者在充实她们各自的特质、欲望和需求方面做得非常出色，这给我留下了深刻的印象。虽然只有三个姐妹，但在其他书中，你可能会看到她们的形象相互融合，让你分不清谁是谁。但在这本书里，她们每个人都感觉如此独特，我从未感到困惑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Yeah. I just love the portrayal of the sisters. They're so independently realized. They're really fully realized. They're just great. They're they work as characters in tandem but also in opposition. And he just did a really good job fleshing out their various idiosyncrasies and desires and wants. I I thought that was very impressive. We're only talking about three sisters here, but even with that, you could see yourself in a different books, seeing them blend into each other and losing track of like, okay, who, you know, this, this, and what did this person do? And but they feel so distinct, each of them, and and I never got lost.</p>
</details>

**Gilbert Cruz:** 这本书充满了活力，尤其是在开头。它把你直接带入她们的生活，在整本书的篇幅里，你都与她们同在。我们喜欢拿长篇小说开玩笑，部分原因是在书评部，我们必须读很多书。所以当我们遇到一本长篇小说时，就会想：“哦不，我读这本书的时间可以读三本书了。”但这本书的长度是合理的，它确实做到了。

<p class="english-text">The book has such an energy, particularly at the beginning. It shoots you into their lives and over the length of this book, which is not insignificant.

#### 《索尼娅与桑尼的孤独》(The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny) by Kiran Desai

**Gilbert Cruz:** 刚刚我们聊的是乔纳斯·哈桑·赫米里的《姐妹们》。我们将过渡到虚构类榜单的第五本书，基兰·德赛的《索尼娅与桑尼的孤独》。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that was The Sisters by Yonas Hassan Kamiri. We're gonna transition to the fifth book on our fiction list, The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny by Kieran Desai.</p>
</details>

**Dave Kim:** 这是一本很棒的老式小说，而且是最好的那种老式。这是一个爱情故事，背景设定在90年代末、21世纪初，讲述了两个印度裔美国人索尼娅和桑尼的故事。索尼娅初登场时是一名大学生，她遇到了一个年长的艺术家伊隆，他是一个狂躁、自大的艺术家，扮演着皮格马利翁式的角色，有些虐待倾向，但对她作为艺术家的觉醒至关重要。他把她带到纽约，然后迅速伤了她的心。桑尼则是一位来自印度的新晋记者，他和一位来自堪萨斯州的白人女性乌拉住在布鲁克林，但他们的关系并不顺利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a great old-fashioned novel and old-fashioned in the best way. It is a story of it's a romance. It's set in the late 90s, early 2000s between two Indian-American people named Sonia and Sunny. Sonia is a college student. When we first meet her, she meets an older artist named Elon, who is this sort of manic, arrogant artist who acts as a real pygmian figure and is somewhat abusive, but also very much very important to her sort of awakening as an artist. He moves her to New York. She wants to be a writer, by the way. He moves her to New York and then promptly breaks her heart and we go from there. And Sunny is a burgeoning journalist from India. He lives in Brooklyn with Oola who is a white woman from Kansas. And things don't quite work out between them.</p>
</details>

**Dave Kim:** 后来，索尼娅和桑尼在去印度旅行的火车上相遇，开始了他们的恋情。他们之前就认识，因为他们的父母曾试图安排一场包办婚姻，但当时两人都兴趣不大。但当他们第二次独立相遇时，火花四溅。当然，复杂的情况依然存在。我喜欢这本书，因为你可以完全沉浸其中。它很长，很多人会抱怨说可以写得短一些，这是对长篇小说的普遍抱怨。但我真的觉得这本书有一种能量，是那种让我很难放下的书。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so Sonia and Sunny meet on a train while visiting India and begin their romance. They knew each other from before because their parents had tried to arrange a marriage that neither of them at the time was particularly interested in pursuing. But the second time around when they meet independently, the sparks fly. But of course, complications remain. I love this book because you could just really sink into it. It's long and so many people are going to complain that it could have been shorter, which is the perennial complaint about long books. obviously, but I really felt there was just a an energy to this book. It was one of those books that I found it very difficult to put down.</p>
</details>

**Gilbert Cruz:** 我的一个朋友在读这本书时说：“每当我没有在读这本书的时候，我都想读这本书。”我们的评论家亚历山德拉·雅各布斯对它赞不绝口。她写道：“耗时近20年，《索尼娅与桑尼的孤独》与其说是一本小说，不如说是一个奇迹。在一个充斥着热点话题和为效率优化的时代，这本书甜蜜地验证了一个观点：要创造出真正卓越的东西，一部描绘爱情、家庭、自然和文化的艺术作品，可能需要时间。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A friend of mine, while they were reading this book, said something to the effect of, "Every time I wasn't reading this book, I wanted to be reading this book." And our critic Alexander Jacobs, I just want to quickly read the first paragraph in her review, which was a rave. She wrote quote almost 20 years in the making. The loneliness of Sonia and Sunny by Kieran Desai is not so much a novel as a marvel. In an era of hot takes and chile optimized productivity, here is sweet validation of the idea that to create something truly transcendent, a work of art depicting love, family, nature, and culture and all their fullness might take time.</p>
</details>

**Juman Katib:** 这本书充满了生命力。这本小说的背景是，距离基兰·德赛上一本小说出版已经过去了大约20年。可以说，《索尼娅与桑尼的孤独》在这期间完全占据了她的生活。手稿一度超过5000页，直到她开始打印出来才意识到。我认为这解释了书中蕴含的智慧、心碎和洞察力。另外值得一提的是，这本书充满了感官和触觉的感受，这非常重要。她借鉴了许多文学传统，我们很多人都把它比作一部宏大的老式小说，但其中有超现实主义的元素，也许还有一些民间传说。看着她像在巨大的织布机上把这一切编织在一起，真是太棒了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's so much life in this book. And the backstory of this novel is that it's been about 20 years since Kieran Desai published a novel. And I think that it's safe to say that Sonia and Sunny totally took over her life in the intervening time. At one point, the manuscript was over 5,000 pages, which she didn't realize until she started printing it out. So, we should probably donate to whatever writing center or fellowship she was at at the time. And I think that accounts for how much sort of wisdom and heartbreak and perspective there is. And I think another thing to mention is there's a lot of sensuality and tactile feeling in this book that's so important. And she's drawing from a lot of literary traditions. I think a lot of us have compared it to a great sweeping old-fashioned novel, but there's elements of surrealism. There's maybe some folklore. There's a there's a a dog that literally dogs Sonia that's a little I'm not going to say magical realism. I'm not going to say magical realism. And it's just it's really just wonderful to watch her pull this together like on this huge loom.</p>
</details>

**Dave Kim:** 我非常喜欢这本书的一个核心主题，那就是艺术家面临的挑战和压力，即如何避免陷入种族刻板印象和身份认同问题，以及西方对东方和东方主义艺术的期望。她处理这个问题的方式非常复杂和有趣。伊隆向索尼娅强调的一点是不要那样做，要抵制白人读者希望从亚洲作家、南亚作家那里看到的叙事。而作者基兰·德赛既抵制又重塑了这一点。她没有回避这些主题，而是真正地将它们变成了自己独一无二的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">one of the things that I really loved about this book was the essential theme of the challenge, the pressure of an artist to to to fall into racial tropes and questions of identity and the ex those sort of western expectations for eastern and orientalist art and her dealing with that is so complex and interesting. One of the things that Elon emphasizes to Sonia is to not do that is to to to resist stay away from narratives that you know that that white readers want of Asian writers of South Asian writers and and she both Kieran des the author both resists and reinvents that she doesn't necessarily shy away from those themes but she really makes them uniquely hers. I think the biggest danger of course is and what Elon was chiding her against was to avoid cliches and to avoid writing things that had already been done and formulaic stuff but but this is this couldn't be further from what Kieran Desai is doing. I mean it really just like I said just making it hers.</p>

</details>

**Juman Katib:** 我有两本。一本是凯蒂·北村的《试镜》。她出版的每一部小说都在改变视角和主题，这让她成为一个非常值得关注的作家。这本小说我形容为小说版的《穆赫兰道》，是一部心理惊悚片。另一本我很喜欢的书是艾米·巴拉德尔的《旅程》。这是一个关于一位纪录片制作人的故事，她和前夫共同抚养一个神经发育异常的儿子。她被派往尼泊尔报道一个佛教会议，结果她死了，被送到了**中阴**（Bardo: 藏传佛教中的概念，指死亡与下一次转世之间的状态），也就是佛教的炼狱。接下来展开的是一场跨维度的冒险，由一位母亲对儿子的爱和关心驱动，穿越了时间和空间。我深受感动。坦白说，这本书很奇特，很大胆。我从未读过类似的东西，我认为这是一项了不起的成就。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I have two at the ready. One is Audition by Katie Kitamura. I'm always interested in what she publishes. Every single novel she's changing her perspective and what she's up to and that just makes her very exciting to follow. And so this novel I describe it as like Mulholland Drive in novel form. It's a psychological thriller. Yeah, that's a movie. The other one that I love and my colleagues know I love this book, but now listeners get to know it's called Trip by Amy Baradel. I really really really fought for this book. So this is the story of a woman who is a documentarian. She is raising a son with her ex who is neurode divergent. I think is on the autism spectrum. She's sent to Nepal to cover this Buddhism conference. And now listeners, you know why I'm primed to like this book. The Buddhist stuff is hysterical. She dies and she's sent to the Bardau, which is the Buddhist like limbo. That's not a spoiler, just to be clear. And what unfolds is this sort of interdimensional romp that's really powered by a mother's love for her son and and concern for him that traverses time and space. And I'm very moved by it. And frankly, it's weird and daring. I've never read anything like it. I think it is such an accomplishment.</p>
</details>

**Dave Kim:** 我非常喜欢巴西作家乔瓦娜·马达洛索的《东京套房》。这是一本关于两个女人的小说。第一个是女佣马茹，第二个是她的老板费尔南达，一位炙手可热的电视制片人。马茹绑架了费尔南达的女儿，小说就此开始。我们不知道她为什么绑架她，但她们在逃亡。我们得到了她们两个人的视角，她们的内心世界、历史和动机。这是一个对母性、阶级等众多主题的迷人探讨，一个非常敏感的描绘，但同时也非常、非常有趣，而且节奏很快。我非常喜欢那本书。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dave, what about you? I really liked the book called The Tokyo Suite by the Brazilian writer Giovana Madalloso. This is a novel about two women. The first is a maid. Her name is Maju. And the second is her boss, Fernanda, who is a hot shot TV producer. And Maju, the maid, has kidnapped Fernand's daughter. And then the novel begins and we don't know why she's kidnapping her, but they're on the run. And we get both of their perspectives. We get their internal lives, their histories, their motivations, and it's just a fascinating look at so many themes, motherhood, class, just a great sensitive portrait, but also very, very funny and and it moves. It moves very quickly. I really love that book.</p>

#### 《海上婚姻》(A Marriage at Sea) by Sophie Elmhirst

**Gilbert Cruz:** 让我们从《海上婚姻》开始。这本书我们书评部的很多人都非常喜欢。格雷格，这本交给你，给我们讲讲吧。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Let's start with a marriage at Sea. This is a book that so many of us loved at the book review. I was able to interview the author Sophie Elmhurst on this podcast earlier this year. Greg, I'm going to give this one to you. Tell us about the book.</p>
</details>

**Greg Kohl's:** 好的。《海上婚姻》讲述了一对夫妇莫里斯和玛丽莲·贝利的故事。他们天生就是不安分的冒险家，与1960年代初他们结婚时英格兰的家庭理想格格不入。所以在1972年6月，在郊区勉强生活了近十年后，他们决定卖掉平房，造一艘船，航行到新西兰重新开始。这将是一次挑战和伟大的冒险。但在某些方面，他们的准备是灾难性的不足。他们没有无线电发射器。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure. Well, A Marriage at Sea is the story of a couple, Morris and Marilyn Bailey, who were restless adventurers by nature and lived out of touch with the domestic ideals of England in the early 1960s when they got married. So in June 1972, after almost 10 years gamely going through the motions in suburbia, they decided to sell their bungalow, build a boat, and sail to New Zealand to start again. It would be a challenge and a great adventure. And in some ways, they were catastrophically unprepared. They had no radio transmitter with them.</p>
</details>

**Gilbert Cruz:** 他们没有无线电，这太疯狂了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's so crazy that they had no no radio.</p>
</details>

**Greg Kohl's:** 玛丽莲甚至不会游泳。但一切都很顺利，直到有一天，他们已经到达太平洋，距离加拉帕戈斯群岛约300英里。一头抹香鲸正好在他们的船下浮出水面，撕开了一个洞，导致船只倾覆。于是莫里斯和玛丽莲抓住了救生筏和他们能收集到的任何物资——一些罐头食品和水，一些工具。有趣的是，还有一些书和笔记本。在接下来的四个月里，他们不得不在这艘小艇上自生自灭，在公海上漂流，希望能被救援，而一艘又一艘的船只经过却都没有发现他们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Maryland didn't even know how to swim. Um but it all went well until one day they had reached the Pacific already. They're about 300 miles away from the Galapagus Islands. A sperm whale surfaced right under their boat, tearing a hole through it and capsizing them. So Morris and Marilyn grabbed the life raft and whatever supplies they were able to gather, some tins of food and water, some tools. Interestingly, some books and notebooks, and for the next four months, they had to fend for themselves in this little dinghy on the open ocean, hoping for rescue as ship after ship passed by without spotting them.</p>
</details>

**Gilbert Cruz:** 这是一个我以前从未听说过的故事，尽管这对夫妇自己曾在70年代写过一本关于这段经历的书。但作者索菲·埃尔姆赫斯特，她不仅精彩地重述了他们在海上漂流的118天，而且正如副标题所示，这确实是一个关于他们婚姻的故事，这对古怪夫妇奇特、美妙而独特的婚姻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A very elegant summary of a a gripping story. I'm someone who loves a tale on the high seas. I love a shipwreck. I love the idea of figuring out how to survive out there in the wild. This is a story that I'd never heard of before, even though the couple themselves had written an account of it in the ' 70s, but the author, Sophie Elmhurst, she takes that account, she takes all the contemporaneous news stories of the time and really weaves together not only an amazing retelling of their 118 days on the high seas, but also, as the subtitle indicates, it is really this story about their marriage. this this couple's this odd couple's odd and wonderful and unique marriage.</p>
</details>

**Emily Aken:** 我非常喜欢这本书。文笔非凡，想象力极其生动。我读的时候感觉，埃尔姆赫斯特为这个故事带来的想象力壮举，与这对夫妇坚持下去所需要的想象力壮举是相当的，这主要归功于玛丽莲。有趣的是，她做了各种莫里斯认为完全不理性的事情。她坐在这艘船上计划晚宴，计划他们的下一个家。她在纸片上画扑克牌，纸片会变得湿透，但她通过想象他们还活着来维持他们的生命。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I loved this book. The writing is extraordinary. It's so vividly imagined and I felt reading it that it the feat of imagination that Elmherst brings to this story was equivalent to the feat of imagination that it took for this couple to persevere mainly thanks to Marilyn. And that's what's really interesting is that she did all kinds of things that Morris thought was completely irrational. She sat there planning dinner parties on this boat. She planned their next home. She drew playing cards on pieces of paper that would get totally soggy, but she kept them alive by imagining that they were alive.</p>
</details>

**Nema Jeromi:** 对我来说，这本书最引人注目的方面之一是它转换视角的方式。你感觉自己就在船上和他们在一起，非常紧张，有时甚至对他们感到生气，但同时也印象深刻。埃尔姆赫斯特一直在传达他们是如何衰弱、崩溃，并长出各种伤口。情况变得相当恶心，但你并没有真正意识到情况有多糟糕，直到他们被一艘韩国渔船救起。那时你才真正发现他们在海上漂流了几个月后变成了什么样子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For me, I think one of the most remarkable aspects of this book also is the way that it shifts perspective. You are so on the boat with them, feeling so tense, kind of mad at them at times, but also impressed. And Elmharst is relaying throughout how they're decaying and falling apart and gaining all these wounds. It gets pretty disgusting, but you don't really realize how bad it's gotten until they are Is it safe to say, it's not a spoiler to say they are rescued? I don't think it is. I don't think it is. By a South Korean fishing vessel and then you really find out what they've come to look like after all these months at sea.</p>
</details>

**Gilbert Cruz:** 我向很多人推荐了这本书，也因为它相对于我们榜单上的其他一些书来说篇幅较短。我预测这本书会是很多读者愿意与他人分享的一本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've recommended this book also because of its relatively short length compared to some of the other books in our list. I've recommended it to so many people this year and I predict that this is one that a lot of readers are going to share with others.</p>
</details>

#### 《我们无处容身》(There Is No Place for Us) by Brian Goldstone

**Gilbert Cruz:** 好了，让我们转向一本令人沮丧，但重要且感人的书。艾米丽，你来谈谈这本，《我们无处容身》。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Let us move on to a depressing, to be frank, a depressing, but important and moving book. Emily, you're going to talk about this one. This is There Is No Place for Us.</p>
</details>

**Emily Aken:** 好的。《我们无处容身》作者是布莱恩·戈德斯通。这是一本经过大量研究和报道的书，讲述了一个影响了数十万美国人但基本上被忽视的现象，那就是“在职无家可归者”。戈德斯通一开始就指出，这个词组本身听起来就不可能，像是一个矛盾或悖论。为什么一个有工作的人会没有家？不幸的是，在美国，这描述了非常多的人。我想先说一个他早期给出的统计数据，因为它几乎告诉了你需要知道的一切：在美国，没有任何一个城市的全职最低工资工人能负担得起租一套两居室公寓。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. There is No Place for Us by Brian Goldstone. This is a predigiously researched and reported book about a phenomenon that affects hundreds of thousands of Americans, but which has gone basically unnoticed. And that is the phenomenon of the working homeless. And Goldstone points out right away that the phrase itself sounds impossible. It sounds like a contradiction or an oxymoron. Why would someone with a job not have a home? And unfortunately in America, that describes a hell of a lot of people. And I want to get one statistic out of the way that he gives us early on because I think it tells you almost everything you need to know, which is that apparently there is no city in America where a full-time minimum wage worker can afford to rent a two-bedroom apartment.</p>
</details>

**Emily Aken:** 戈德斯通在这本书中的成就是带我们进入了亚特兰大五个家庭的生活，他跟踪了他们很长时间。我们对这些家庭有了非常深入的了解，他们的生活就是“在职无家可归”。对这些家庭来说，家是一辆车、亲戚的沙发，或者更典型的是，在一家长住汽车旅馆里一个蟑螂和霉菌丛生的房间。这是一本写得很美的书，我们真的为这些家庭加油，与他们一同愤怒。我认为戈德斯通做得非常巧妙的一点是，他清楚地表明，导致一个家庭陷入这种境地的因素并非单一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that's pretty discouraging. And Goldstone's feat in this book is to bring us into the lives of five families in Atlanta where he lives whom he followed for a very long time. We get to know these families quite intimately for whom working homeless describes their lives. These are in one case at least a twoarent family with a couple of kids. In several other cases it's a single mom with several kids. And for these families, home is a car, a relative's couch, or more typically a roach and moldinfested room in an extended stay in motel. This is a beautifully written book. We really root for these families. We rage with these families. And one of the, I think, really artful things that Goldstone does is make make clear that there's not simply one factor that accounts for why a family would fall into this situation.</p>
</details>

**Emily Aken:** 是的，低迷的工资经济是一个主要原因，但他还考虑了许多其他变量：掠夺性的房地产公司，通常由遥远的**私募股权**（Private Equity: 投资于非上市公司的基金）公司经营，如果你晚交一天房租，他们就会驱逐你；老板不给你一天假去找公寓；偏向增长而非可负担性的城市发展；以及旨在偏袒房东而非租户的法律。这本书真的改变了我看待周围环境的方式。你会看着你互动的人，一个优步司机，你在CVS的收银员，甚至一个同事，然后想，仅仅因为他们有工作，他们就有家吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, the depressed wage economy is a big culprit, but there are many other variables that he considers. Predatory real estate companies, often run by private equity firms far away, who will evict you if you're so much as a day late on your rent. A boss who won't give you a day off to look for an apartment. Urban development that favors growth over affordability. In New York City, we just elected a mayor who ran on a platform of affordability and drew a huge turnout of voters concerned about this issue. So, this is a big problem. And finally, laws that are designed to favor landlords over tenants. This is a book that really changed how I looked at my environment. And I think you look at the people you interact with, an Uber driver, your cashier at CVS, even a co-orker, and wonder just because they have a job, do they have a home?</p>
</details>

**Gilbert Cruz:** 艾米丽，读这本书让我非常愤怒。它让我非常难过。在纽约长大，我一直被街头流浪和睡在地铁车厢里的人们所包围。戈德斯通很快就想让读者明白，我们对无家可归有先入为主的观念，关于无家可归者类型的可怕刻板印象。但那并不是无家可归的全部，尤其是在这个国家。正如你指出的，全国各大城市有工作的人数之多——他找到了亚特兰大的五个家庭，他们有工作，这是你为了养活自己和家人应该做的事，但仍然负担不起一个固定的家——这令人难以置信地沮丧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Emily, I was so infuriated reading this book. It made me so sad. Having grown up in New York, I've always been surrounded by the sights of people living on the street and sleeping in subway cars. And one of the things that Goldstone, you know, really tries to to impress upon his readers very quickly is we have these preconceived notions of what it means to be hopeless. Awful stereotypes about what the types of people that are homeless. You're living on the street, you're living in a shelter. There are many people that believe homelessness is a moral problem, that you did something to deserve it, that you have a substance abuse problem. That's not the totality of what it means to be homeless, certainly in this country. And as you well pointed out, the number of people in major cities across the country, he found five families in Atlanta who have jobs, the thing you are supposed to do if you are trying to support yourself and your family and still cannot afford to have a regular home is incredibly depressing.</p>
</details>

**Nema Jeromi:** 我认为很少有书能真正深刻地改变你看待世界的方式，而这本书就是其中之一。我认为它应该和马修·德斯蒙德的《被驱逐者》以及安德里亚·埃利奥特的《看不见的孩子》放在同一个书架上，这些近期的书籍以一种新的方式审视了美国的底层阶级。这确实是一本非常重要的书。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think there are so few books that actually really affect a profound change in how you see the world. And this is one of those books. I think it belongs on a shelf with Evicted by Matthew Desmond and Invisible Child by Andrea Elliot. recent books that have looked at the American underclass in a new way. This is just a really important book.</p>
</details>

**Gilbert Cruz:** 我想说，是的，是近期的书，但马修·德斯蒙德的《被驱逐者》是书评部十佳图书之一，那已经是差不多十年前的事了。这更凸显了这本书的令人沮丧之处，也更显示了它的重要性，因为它表明了在这些年里情况几乎没有改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I want to say recent books, yes, but Matthew Desmond's Evicted was one of the book reviews 10 best books almost a decade ago. And it just highlights it makes this book all the more disheartening but also important to the extent that it shows how little has changed in the intervening years.</p>
</details>

#### 《野性之物》(Wild Thing) by Sue Prideaux

**Gilbert Cruz:** 内玛，带我们进入过去吧。我想请你谈谈榜单上的这本传记，《野性之物：保罗·高更的一生》。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">getting angry all over again. Nema, take us away. Take us into the past. I'd love for you to talk about the biography on this list. Wild Thing, a life of Paul Gauguin.</p>
</details>

**Nema Jeromi:** 好的。这是一本关于画家保罗·高更的传记，色彩斑斓。书中既有巴黎的繁华景象，也有法属波利尼西亚的风光，高更在那里度过了他生命的最后几年。书中有复杂的艺术分析和政治复杂性。我们了解到，高更出生于特权阶层，但在1848年革命期间，他不得不随家人离开欧洲，部分原因是他祖母是一位激进的左翼女权主义者，国家非常不喜欢她。所以他们去了秘鲁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. This is a biography of the painter Paul Gauguin that is in technicolor. There are lush scenes both in Paris and French Polynesia where Gauguin spent the last years of his life. Sophisticated art analysis. There's political complexity. We learn that Gauguin was born basically into privilege. He had to leave Europe with his family during the revolutions of 1848 in part because his grandmother, we find out, was this radical leftist feminist who the state really did not like. So they went to Peru.</p>
</details>

**Nema Jeromi:** 后来他成了一名股票经纪人。但当19世纪末市场崩盘时，他开始拿起画笔，心想：“这就是我重振家业的方式。”结果好坏参半，最终在他生命的尽头来到了法属波利尼西亚。这本传记希望展示的是，高更被视为一个好色的怪物。作者苏·普里多甚至谈到在一个旧井里发现的四颗牙齿，似乎证明高更没有得**梅毒**（Syphilis: 一种性传播感染病）。我很惊讶有那么多人似乎都知道保罗·高更有梅毒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But then he became a a stock broker. But then when the market crashed in the late 19th century, he he had been collecting all of these painters, a lot of I believe both impressionists and postimpressionists, some of the heavy hitters of his generation. And then he started to take up the brush himself and he thought, "This is how I'm going to make back my family's fortune with mixed results and and ended up toward the end of his life in French Polynesia." One thing that this biography hopes to show is that Gan is seen as this sort of like lustful monster. Suprio, the author of this book, goes so far as to talk about four teeth that were found in an old well that seemed to prove that Gauguin didn't have syphilis. I really was surprised by how many people appear to have known that Paul Gauguin had syphilis.</p>
</details>

**Nema Jeromi:** 我印象最深的一个场景是，梵高割掉耳朵之前，高更就在他身边。他看到梵高手里拿着剃刀，却什么也没做，并为此后悔终生，心想“我本可以阻止这一切发生”。这是一本充满遗憾的传记，一本美丽的传记。高更最终真的成为了他自己声称的“来自秘鲁的野人”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the one that stuck out to me most is I think it's somewhat common knowledge that but I didn't know that Gauguin was there when Van Gogh just before he cut off his ear and he sees Van Go holding the razor in his hand and does nothing and thinks for the rest of his life I could have stopped this from happening. This is a a haunted biography. It's a a beautiful biography and Gauguin really becomes the savage from Peru. He insists that he is at the end or the savage from abroad anyway.</p>
</details>

**Emily Aken:** 我同意你说的每一点，内玛。这是一本美丽的书。作者是一位非常出色的传记作家，她写过尼采、斯特林堡和其他一两位画家的传记。所以她对材料的驾驭能力非常强。书中点缀着关于艺术的短文，对高更极具创新性的绘画、陶瓷和木雕进行了细致的解读。他是一位疯狂的艺术家，拒绝了**印象派**（Impressionists: 19世纪末的艺术运动）的绘画模板，真正发明了一整套全新的艺术语言。我想说，这可能是我们非虚构类最佳图书中最诙谐的一本。它有一种非常谦逊、低调的智慧，读起来非常愉快。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">this is I agree with everything you've said Nema this is a beautiful book she's such such an excellent biographer. She is a prolific biographer. She's written biographies of Nietze and Stinberg and I think one or two other painters. Edward Monk. And so she's so in command of the material. The book is dotted with little aides about the art, close readings of Goan's very innovative paintings and ceramics and wood carvings. He was a crazy man artist, rejecting the impressionists templates for how to paint color and really inventing his entire new idiom. I would say that this is the wittiest book maybe among our our non-fiction best books. It's got a very unassuming, low-key wit that's just utterly a pleasure to read.</p>
</details>

**Gilbert Cruz:** 普里多在她的引言或序言中阐述了她的意图。她说：“最近出现了大量新材料，恰逢当代围绕他那令人不安的声誉展开的辩论，这使得重新审视高更的一生成得尤为重要。不是为了谴责，不是为了辩解，而仅仅是为了给这个人和这个神话带来新的光芒。”我觉得这正是她在这本书中完成的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Prito says in her introduction or preface she lays out a statement of intent. She says, "The recent appearance of so much new material coinciding with contemporary debate around his troubling reputation made it seem important to re-examine Goan's life. Not to condemn, not to excuse, but simply to shed new light on the man and the myth." And I feel like that is exactly what she accomplishes in this book.</p>
</details>

#### 《圣母玛利亚来到我身边》(Mother Mary Comes to Me) by Arundhati Roy

**Gilbert Cruz:** 我们将从传记转向回忆录。内玛，我再回到你这里，谈谈阿兰达蒂·洛伊的《圣母玛利亚来到我身边》。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We are going to go from biography to memoir. Nema, I'm going to come back to you over here to talk about Mother Mary comes to me by Arundhati Roy.</p>
</details>

**Nema Jeromi:** 这是阿兰达蒂·洛伊的回忆录，她是一位迷人、开朗、讽刺的活动家和小说家，写了《微物之神》。这实际上是她一生的写照，但也是她母亲的写照，以及她母亲如何塑造了她的生活。她的母亲是一个充满活力、令人敬畏的人物，在喀拉拉邦经营着一所名义上是基督教但行事方式却很不基督教的学校。她让学生和自己的孩子都对她既恐惧又敬畏。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is a memoir by Arandati Roy, as you said, the charming, cheerful, sardonic activist and novelist who wrote the god of small things. And it's really it's a portrait of her life, but it's also a portrait of her mother and how her mother shaped her life. Her mother was this dynamic, formidable figure who ran this school that was nominally Christian in Carerala in a pretty uncchristian-like way. And she inspired much fear and reverence in her pupils as she did in her children.</p>
</details>

**Nema Jeromi:** 但她也是一个虐待孩子的母亲。最近有很多关于糟糕婚姻和糟糕父母的揭露性回忆录。但阿兰达蒂·洛伊从一开始就声明：“我并不为我妈妈的去世感到高兴。事实上，我以为她会永远活着，她会离开对我来说是不可思议的。”洛伊所做的，几乎像一个魔术，尽管她的母亲非常不稳定，对孩子们大喊大叫，因为哥哥成绩单不佳而打他，但她不知何故让这一切都变得有趣。每一章都像一个喜剧演员的精彩十分钟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but also she was an abusive mom and there have been a lot of tell all memoirs out lately about bad marriages and bad parents. I think the most obvious example is Janette Mccertie searing I'm glad my mom died about the abuse she got from her mother as a child actress. But Arandati Roy states from the very beginning, I'm not glad my mom died. In fact, I thought she would be alive forever and it was inconceivable to me that she would go. And the thing that Roy does, which is almost a magic trick, is despite her mother who was very unstable, shout at her children, hit her brother for having a subpar report card, is she somehow makes all of this funny. It every chapter, it's hard to pull out one sentence and say where the jokes are, but every chapter is like a comedian's tight 10.</p>
</details>

**Emily Aken:** 这是一本顶级的书。她是一位非常出色的作家。我喜欢这本回忆录的地方在于它的不带感情色彩，她以一种完全就事论事的方式讲述了与一个不稳定、非理性的父母之间严重的虐待关系。你永远不知道她什么时候会把桌上所有的茶杯都扫到地上。但是，是的，它以一种轻描淡写、就事论事的方式完成，所以很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is a superlative book. She's just such an excellent writer. We should say The God of Small Things won the Booker Prize and a subsequent novel was long listed for the Booker Prize. You are in the hands of such an excellent writer. What I loved about this memoir was the unscentimentality, the completely matter-of-act way she goes about recounting a seriously abusive relationship with a parent who was unstable, irrational. You never knew when she was going to sweep all the teacups off the table and throw them on the floor. But yes, it's done with such a light touch and so matterofactly that it's humorous.</p>
</details>

#### 《伊曼纽尔母亲教堂》(Mother Emanuel) by Kevin Sack

**Gilbert Cruz:** 我们将回到美国，讨论最后一本书。《伊曼纽尔母亲教堂：两个世纪的种族、抵抗与宽恕，以及一座查尔斯顿教堂》。这本书的作者是凯文·萨克，他曾在这里的《纽约时报》工作。艾米丽，我记得你曾极力推荐这本书。请给我们讲讲吧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're going to come back here to the states with our final book. This is Mother Emmanuel. Two centuries of race, resistance, and forgiveness in one Charleston church. This is by Kevin Sack, who used to work here at the New York Times. And Emily, I recall you just stumping so so hard for this book. Please tell us about it.</p>
</details>

**Emily Aken:** 当然。《伊曼纽尔母亲教堂》这个名字深深烙印在许多美国人的脑海中，它是一起可怕的仇恨犯罪的发生地。伊曼纽尔母亲教堂是南卡罗来纳州查尔斯顿的**非洲卫理公会**（African Methodist Episcopal Church: 一个主要由非裔美国人组成的卫理宗教派）教堂。2015年，一名白人至上主义者在那里枪杀了九名圣经学习班的成员，而这些人曾邀请他加入他们。这本书是对那场悲剧的深刻记述，但它远不止于此。它是一部关于南方黑人教会的有力历史，最终也是一部关于美国种族与宗教交织的历史。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I blush, Gilbert. But this is a really good book. Of course, Mother Emanuel is a name seared into the minds of many Americans as the site of a horrific hate crime. Mother Emanuel being the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, where in 2015, a white supremacist shot and killed nine members of a Bible study class who had invited him into their midst. This book is a searing account of that tragedy, but it's also a lot more. It's a powerful history of the black church in the South, and ultimately it's a history of the imation of race and religion in America.</p>
</details>

**Emily Aken:** 作者萨克是《纽约时报》前资深记者，他来自南方。他被报社派去报道大屠杀的后续。他很快意识到，这个故事远不止这件可怕的事件。伊曼纽尔母亲教堂不仅仅是任何一座教堂，它是南方第一座非洲卫理公会教堂，是查尔斯顿最古老的黑人会众之一。而查尔斯顿长期以来是黑人生活的中心，是奴隶贸易的心脏，当然也是内战开始的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And as Gilbert said, Sack, the author, is a former longtime New York Times reporter. He's from the South. He went to school in the South. And he was assigned by the paper to cover the aftermath of the massacre. And he quickly realized, as he explains in the book, that there was a lot more to this story than this terrible event. Mother Emanuel wasn't just any church. It was the first AM church in the South. It's one of the oldest black congregations in Charleston. And Charleston is a city that was long at the center of black life. It was the heart of the slave trade. And of course, it was the place where the civil war began.</p>
</details>

**Emily Aken:** 在一个宗教和种族如此深刻地融入我们国家政治和对话的时刻，这本书感觉非常及时和重要。我们的评论员，哈佛法学院教授兰德尔·肯尼迪称其为“杰作”，我完全同意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, so much symbolism converging around this event, but Sack has it completely under his control. He spent 10 years, almost 10 years writing this book. He actually moved to Charleston at some point in the process. And it it is another feat of research and reporting. So he takes us through the night of the massacre and and yes this is a visceral unsparing account. We get to know each of the victims and the survivors very intimately but he does this with enormous sensitivity and we then get to know the church as well. This this church is the protagonist, if you will, for the book, a kind of a through line. And it's an extraordinary structure containing all this history. And we get a history of Charleston, which turns out to be fascinating. It was a very, very wealthy city, one of the wealthiest in the 13 colonies, and had from very early on a substantial black population. By the early 19th century, it was more than 50% black, although most of those residents were enslaved. And what this meant was that the white authorities were incredibly paranoid about the possibility of insurrection and that the rules and regulations governing black life in Charleston were just particularly draconian. You couldn't walk down a street and sing if you were a black resident. You couldn't raise your voice in public if you were a black resident. And you certainly did not have the right to freedom of assembly, to worship in a black church. It took a walk out and a lawsuit in the early 19th century for the first black AM congregation to form. And we also get simultaneously a history of Methodism which turns out to be fascinating too. A strain of Christianity that offered a more personal, intimate, even ecstatic version of Christianity compared with the dominant Calvinist tradition and notably was abolitionist. And tragically, the church as it expanded to the southern slave states abandoned its abolitionist stance. And so you see the black church evolve not just as a site of worship and faith, but as resistance through reconstruction, through the civil rights period. Martin Luther King comes to speak there. Pastors are often politicians, including the pastor who was killed in 2015. The Reverend Clementa Pinkney was a very well-reggarded beloved state senator. So, we get all of this history and at a moment when religion and race are so much a part of our national politics and conversation, this book just feels incredibly timely and and essential. Our reviewer Randall Kennedy, a Harvard Law School professor, called it a masterpiece, and I would not disagree.</p>

**Nema Jeromi:** 这段历史远远超出了内战，延伸到重建时期，展示了这座教堂如何试图在美国生活中扮演道德支柱的角色，同时又与美国的政治现实进行协商。尽管如此，我认为这本书真正闪光的地方在于它的开头和结尾，对屠杀的描述让你感觉自己仿佛即将被爆头，对幸存者向袭击者迪伦·鲁夫表示宽恕的复杂反应，以及最终鲁夫的毫无悔意。它真正展示了现在与过去是如何相互映照的。

<p class="english-text">The history really carries on far past the Civil War into reconstruction, showing how this church tried to be both a moral anchor in American life while also negotiating itself with American political reality as any kind of influential entity in any country might. I do, despite what I said, I do think actually this book really shines in the bookends, in the descriptions of the rampage, which make you feel like you're about to be shot in the head, in the mixed reactions to the forgiveness offered to the asalent, Dylan Roof, by the survivors, and finally in Roof's remorselessness and the fight over how money donated from around the country became an issue in the wake of the tragedy. It really shows how the present and the past are these beacons that bounce light off of each other.</p>

#### 编辑们的遗珠之憾（非虚构类）

**Gilbert Cruz:** 我们今年的五本非虚构类图书是：《海上婚姻》、《伊曼纽尔母亲教堂》、《我们无处容身》、《野性之物》和《圣母玛利亚来到我身边》。在我们结束讨论之际，我想请你们每个人提一本不在这个名单上但你们非常喜欢的非虚构类书籍。我选尼古拉斯·博格斯的传记《鲍德温》。这是一本关于作家詹姆斯·鲍德温的传记，副标题是“一个爱情故事”。这本传记特别通过他浪漫关系的框架来审视鲍德温的生活，这是以前的传记作者大多回避的。

<p class="english-text">The five non-fiction books that we put on this year's list of the top 10 books of 2025. Again, a marriage at sea. Mother Emmanuel, there is no place for us. Wild Thing and Mother Mary comes to me. As we draw towards the end of our conversation here, I wanted to ask each of you to mention a non-fiction book that's not on this list that you nonetheless really loved. I will go with the biography Baldwin by Nicholas Boggs. It's a biography of the writer James Baldwin. The subtitle is a love story, and this is a biography that specifically looks at Baldwin's life through the frame of his romantic relationships, which previous biographers have largely shied away from, partly because Baldwin was gay and was often involved with men who went on to marry women and have families. And so there was maybe a sense of circumspection in uncovering those. And also because it took some digging to find out who those were. But where you might feel a sense of purience knowing that's the framing, it's in fact you come away feeling this is an absolutely necessary way to approach Baldwin's life and work that love was such a resounding theme through everything that he wrote and you realize how intimately these relationships affected his life and his work. So, so that was a biography I really enjoyed this year.</p>

**Greg Kohl's:** 我要提一下斯蒂芬·格林布拉特的《黑暗复兴》。这是哈佛教授、历史学家格林布拉特的一本非常激动人心的书，他是莎士比亚和英国文艺复兴的世界权威。这是一本关于剧作家克里斯托弗·马洛的传记，他与莎士比亚同年出生，生活狂野不羁，可能曾是英国王室的间谍，在29岁被谋杀前写了几部非常重要的戏剧。格林布拉特在书中的大胆论点是，是马洛，而不是莎士比亚，启动了英国文艺复兴。

<p class="english-text">Baldwin, a love story by Nicholas Boggs. Let's see. I'm going to mention Dark Renaissance by Steven Greenblat. This is just a very exciting book by Greenblat, the Harvard professor historian who is a world authority on Shakespeare and the English Renaissance. It's a biography of the playwright Christopher Marlowe who was born in 1564 in Canterbury. He was born just a couple months before Shakespeare and lived a wild and crazy life. He may have been a spy for the English crown and he managed to write several really important plays before being murdered at the tender age of 29. Greenblat's thesis, his very bold claim in this book is that it was Marlo, not Shakespeare, who jumpstarted the English Renaissance that before Marlo wrote Tamberlain and Dr. Foustus, his most famous plays, England was culturally speaking just an incipid benol backwater. This is quite a claim. And a moreover, aside from the ays, Marlo just didn't leave very much documentation about his life. But that does not stop Greenblat. He is so knowledgeable about the period and such an excellent storyteller and such a great close reader of the plays that he really lays out and makes his case and makes the book a thrill to read.</p>

**Nema Jeromi:** 我要推荐朱莉娅·约菲的《祖国：从革命到独裁的现代俄罗斯女权史》。这不仅仅是因为它为我们的书单增加了一个“母亲”标题。这是一本非常迷人、微妙、引人入胜，时而有趣的书，讲述了朱莉娅·约菲的自我发现之旅。她1990年随家人搬到马里兰州，当时她7岁，正值苏联解体。她家族中的年长女性大多是科学家或医生，所以她对苏联世界的印象是一个知识女性的乌托邦。但当她2009年作为记者回到莫斯科时，发现这个国家几乎没有这种理想的痕迹，她想知道为什么。她回顾历史，发现虽然有很多像她家人那样的女性确实存在，但苏联一次又一次地未能实现自己的理想。

<p class="english-text">That was Dark Renaissance by Steven Greenblat. Nema, take us home. I'm going to recommend Julia Yafi's Motherland: A Feminist History of Modern Russia from Revolution to Autocracy. And not just because it puts one more mom or mother title in our list. This is a really fascinating, very subtle, engaging, at times funny, and interesting book about Julia Yafy's own self-discovery. She moved with her family to Maryland just as the Soviet Union was falling apart in 1990 when she was 7 years old. Most of the older women in Yafy's family were scientists or doctors. So this was her vision of the Soviet world, a utopia for women of intellect. But then she goes back to Moscow as a journalist in 2009 and discovers there really isn't much of a vestage of this ideal in the country and she wonders why. And she goes back through this history to discover that while there were many women like the women in her family that did exist, the Soviet Union again and again fell short of its own ideals. That is Motherland by Julia Yaffy.</p>
