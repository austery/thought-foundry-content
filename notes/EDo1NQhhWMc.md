title: 政治抑郁症：无力感、恐惧与希望的追寻

### 引言：政治抑郁症的困扰

大约一年前，我的朋友告诉我他患上了**政治抑郁症**（Political Depression: 一种非正式的心理状态，指因政治事件或社会环境而产生的持续性抑郁情绪）。我当时并未太在意，因为我认为它不是一个正式的医学术语，而且我的朋友意志力相当坚强。然而，在接下来的一年里，他持续不断地谈论这个话题。他说他每天大概要花七八个小时去浏览那些让他感到非常不快的新闻，夜里失眠，并且他逐渐失去了对工作、对生活乃至对整个人生的兴趣。当他开始谈论死亡时，我变得非常担忧。于是我开始调查这个问题，但我发现很少有中文和英文文献可供参考。在中文世界中流传最广的一篇文章是由一位美国心理学家撰写的，他的名字是罗伯特·卢森（Robert Rosen）。因此，我联系了他。这不是一次学术访谈，这只是一个关心朋友的普通人与一位医生之间的对话。今天我播出这段对话，希望能帮助我的朋友以及其他有类似困境的人。

<p class="english-text">About a year ago, my friend told me he had political depression. I didn't take it seriously at the time because I didn't think political depression was a formal medical term, and my friend was quite strong-willed. But over the past year, he kept talking about it. He said he spent about seven or eight hours a day scrolling through news that made him very unhappy, suffered from insomnia at night, and slowly lost interest in work, life, and even his entire existence. When he started talking about death, I became very worried. So I started to investigate this issue, but there were very few Chinese and English documents I could find. The most widely spread article in the Chinese world was written by an American psychologist named Robert Rosen. So I contacted him. This was not an academic interview; this was just a conversation between an ordinary person who cares about his friend and a doctor. Today I broadcast it, hoping to help my friend and someone who has similar difficulties like him.</p>

### 政治抑郁症的真实性与核心

柴静问道：“**政治抑郁症**是真的吗？政治抑郁症是真的吗？”卢森博士回答说：“这是一个很好的问题。如果你走进我的诊室，开始谈论一些事情，你可能会对我说：‘嗯，这听起来没什么道理，但我就是有这种感觉。’哦，回家吧。当然，这很有道理，而且是真实的，因为如果你感受到了，那就是真实的。至少在我所接触的美国人中，我们曾感到在民主协议下可以自由地质疑一切，但仍然能文明地对待他人。而现在我们不再有这种感觉了。我就是他们，或者他们会说，我对此感到非常沮丧。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"Is political depression real? Is political depression real?" "What a good question. If you come into the room with me and you start talking about something and you could say to me, 'Well, this makes no sense, but I'm feeling it.' Oh, go home. Well, of course it makes sense and it's for real because if you're feeling it, it's real. At least in America where I was seeing these people was... that we felt free under democratic agreement to question everything, but to still treat people civilly. And now we don't feel that anymore. And I am they, or they would say, 'I'm super depressed about all this.'"</p>
</details>

柴静继续问：“政治抑郁症与普通抑郁症有何不同？”卢森博士解释道：“政治抑郁症是抑郁症，但它额外增加了一个政治层面。这是一个主要特征，它已经成为一个主要特征。我想知道抑郁症的核心可能是什么：我完全失去了希望，认为这一切永远不会改变我的灵魂、我的精神、我的事业、我的人际关系。所有这些都无法让我以最好的状态成长和发展。这让我感到绝望。”柴静追问：“所以您是说，核心是一种**无力感**（Powerlessness: 缺乏掌控感和改变现状的能力）吗？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"What is the difference between political depression and regular depression?" "Political depression is depression with this added political aspect to it. That is a major feature. It's become a major feature. I want to know the core of depression there could be: I have a total loss of hope that this is ever going to change my soul, my spirit, my career, my relationships. All of them are not going to be—I'm not going to be allowed to grow and evolve with them to the best of me. And that leaves me feeling hopeless." "So you mean the core is kind of feeling like powerlessness?"</p>
</details>

卢森博士肯定道：“是的，伴随着完全失去任何掌控感而来的，是一种无力感。这是一种权力的丧失。是的，我认为你提出的观点非常好。是的，这是一种无力感，感觉无论我做什么，都不会被看见，也不会被听见。这也是普通抑郁症的一部分。那些，有一种连接的丧失，一种孤立感，这些都内嵌于普通抑郁症中。”柴静补充道：“所以你可以看到这些都是普通的事情，但是你可以看到在这个叫做**政治压力**（Political Pressure: 由政治环境或事件带来的心理负担）的词语下，每一个东西都还会配合普通人也会有因为政治因素引起的抑郁情绪。但是他是不是抑郁症，这有一个**临床诊断标准**（Clinical Diagnostic Criteria: 医生用于判断疾病的医学标准）。这是卢森博士发给我的这个标准，我贴在了简介里面，你回头可以打开链接来做一个自我诊断的参考。提醒一下，像这些症状当中，像心情郁闷、失眠、无价值感，这些症状需要几乎每一天出现，而且在一天的大部分时间都要出现。而且同时需要五种或者以上的症状在很短时间内同时出现，才能够符合抑郁症的临床诊断标准。”

<details>

<p class="english-text">"Yes, there's a powerlessness that comes with feeling that there's a total loss of any control. There's a loss of power. Yeah, I think that's a very good point that you're saying. Yeah, it's a powerless feeling. It doesn't matter what I do; it's not going to be seen. It's not going to be heard. That's a piece of regular depression too. There's a loss of connection. There's an isolation that's built into regular depression." (Chai Jing's narration continues): "So you can see these are all common things, but you can see that under the term 'political pressure,' everything will still be accompanied by depressive emotions that ordinary people might also experience due to political factors. But whether it is clinical depression, there is a clinical diagnostic standard. This is the standard Dr. Rosen sent me, and I have posted it in the description. You can open the link later for self-diagnosis reference. A reminder: among these symptoms, such as depressed mood, insomnia, and feelings of worthlessness, these symptoms need to appear almost every day and for most of the day. And at the same time, five or more symptoms need to appear simultaneously within a short period to meet the clinical diagnostic criteria for depression."</p>

### 无力感与恐惧：政治抑郁症的驱动力

卢森博士指出，政治抑郁症可能符合所有这些标准，但它有一个额外的维度，那就是失去对自己命运掌控的思维和感受。他认为，这种感受背后的驱动力是**恐惧**（Fear: 对潜在危险或威胁的心理反应）。他提到了两种类型的恐惧：一种是真实的伤害，另一种是**社会歧视**（Social Discrimination: 因某种特征而在社会中受到不公正对待）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dr. Rosen said that political depression may be in line with all these standards, but it has an extra dimension, which is the kind of thought and feeling that has lost control of one's own fate. And he believes that the driving force behind this feeling is fear. He mentioned two types of fear: one is real harm, the other is social discrimination.</p>
</details>

柴静问道：“您提到恐惧是政治抑郁症背后的主要驱动力。我想问您这个问题，关于物质伤害。如果我在市中心举着牌子走出去，比如在哪里？北京。在北京。那会有什么后果？”卢森博士回答：“是的，你会被捕。”柴静追问：“那你的家人也会被捕吗？”卢森博士说：“这取决于情况。社会恐惧的部分是，我被社会排斥了。人们要么认为我疯了，要么担心如果他们与我交流，他们会遇到麻烦。所以，这是一种社会恐惧。而这正是抑郁症再次出现的地方，因为如果你没有发现自己是一个真实的人，没有在自己的生活中真实地展现自己，并能够在自己的生活中出现。”

<details>

<p class="english-text">(Chai Jing): "You mentioned fear as the main drive actually behind political depression. And I'm asking you this question, material harm. If I walked out with a sign in downtown, where? Beijing. Beijing. And what would be the consequences of that?" (Robert Rosen): "Yeah, you would be arrested." (Chai Jing): "And would your family be arrested too?" (Robert Rosen): "It depends. The societal fear part is I'm excluded from society. Either people think I'm crazy or they're worried that something would happen to them if they communicate with me. So that'd be a societal fear. And that's where, again, depression comes in because if you don't find you're being an authentic person, that you're being authentic in your own life and being able to show up in your own life."</p>
</details>

柴静继续说：“对于我的朋友来说，他曾经是您提到的那种积极的行动者。而这些人往往是最富有激情的人。他们站在前线，很容易看到他们在物质上如何被压制，在社会上如何被压制，以及在个人层面上，这三方面都受到影响。因为他们不断地撞墙，他们如此渴望改变，并且他们是领导者，所以这只会让他们心碎。这真是一件令人心碎的事情。当您开始谈论死亡时，我真的很担心。绝望会是这样的：‘好吧，事情就是这样了，它不会改变，对此我无能为力，我只是想去睡觉。’”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"For my friend, he used to be the type of people that you mentioned is an active doer. And those are the people that are the most passionate people. They're on the front lines, and it's easy to see materially how they could be squashed down, and societally how they could be squashed down, and personally, all three. Because they keep running into that wall, and they want it so bad, and they're leading the charge, that it just crushes their heart. It's a heart-crushing affair. It really worries me when you start talking about death. Hopelessness would be, 'Well, this is the way it is, and it's not going to change. There's nothing I can do about it, and I'm just going to go. Go to sleep.'"</p>
</details>

### 从绝望到希望：改变时间框架

卢森博士使用了一个让我有点毛骨悚然的比喻来形容这样一种状态。他说，这就像一个人在漆黑的大海上航行，你看不到陆地，没有路标，甚至看不到日月星辰。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He used a metaphor that gave me a bit of a chill to describe such a state. He said it's like a person sailing on a dark ocean; you can't see land, there are no landmarks, and you can't even see the sun, moon, or stars.</p>
</details>

柴静说：“你的朋友现在并没有平衡，他只在一个无奈的一边。你对中国20年来，谁可以假设他知道中国将会是怎样的？我们中有人知道吗？”卢森博士回答：“他有一个预测。是的，他有一个预测。这是关于未来可能发生的灾难。”柴静说：“我会回应说，‘好吧，你凭什么认为你的预测不仅仅是一个预测呢？’嗯，这是一个非常直接的问题。但这仍然是一个预测。我不知道，我也不在乎。”卢森博士解释道：“好的。你能多解释一下吗？我内心深知，我坚信，从我交谈过的普通人，街上的普通人那里，我们都想要另一种东西。这就是‘我不在乎’的部分。我不在乎这需要一千年才能实现。这就是抑郁和希望之间的区别。”柴静说：“所以你只是改变了**时间框架**（Time Frame: 考虑问题或事件的时间跨度）。”卢森博士说：“是的，我正在改变，但不仅仅是这样。当你这样说的时候，当它变得如此具体的时候，我也有选择，因为我真的相信，事情明天就可能改变。我将出现在门口，尽我所能帮助实现这种改变。”

<details>

<p class="english-text">(Chai Jing): "Your friend is not balanced right now; he's only on the side of helplessness. For China over the past 20 years, who can assume they know what China will be like? Do any of us know?" (Robert Rosen): "He has a prediction. Yes, he has a prediction. It's in the future about a possible disaster." (Chai Jing): "And I would say back to that, 'Well, who are you to presume that your prediction is any more than a prediction?' Well, it's a very direct question. But it's still a prediction. I don't know. And I don't care." (Robert Rosen): "Okay. Can you explain more about this? I know in my heart, I believe in my heart, and from the people, the normal people I speak to, regular people, the regular people in the street, that we want this other thing. And this is the 'I don't care' part. I don't care if it takes a thousand years to get there. That's the difference between depression and hope." (Chai Jing): "So you've just changed the time frame." (Robert Rosen): "Yeah, I'm changing, but it's not only that. When you say it, put it that way, when it becomes that literal. I also have the option, because I really do believe this, things could change tomorrow. And I'm going to show up at the door doing whatever I can to help make that change."</p>

### 活在当下：应对焦虑与不确定性

柴静问道：“在这一点上，我能做些什么来防止最坏的情况发生在我的朋友身上？他能离开这个国家吗？”卢森博士回答：“他确实离开了。他搬到了一个外国。恐惧消失了，但抑郁仍然存在。”卢森博士微笑着说：“世界，世界是一个混乱的烂摊子。生活是混乱的。生活是混乱的。世界是混乱的。另一部分是更深层次的东西。它会持续更长时间。这是他的一部分，对吗？他可能从三岁起就一直带着它。他失去了希望，他必须找回它。他迷失了，他正在找回它。所以，如果我与这样的人一起工作，我会让他们稍微平静一下。我会递给他们一张纸，上面写着：‘今天给自己放个假，去坐过山车吧。’大概就是这样。这就是为什么我转到这部分对话，关于一些理解。一旦你有了这些，你就在我的诊室里，一旦你有了那次对话，你可能会对此感到更平静一些。”柴静总结道：“所以，也许关键在于重新获得力量和生命的意义，以治愈自己，疗愈自己。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">(Chai Jing): "What can I do at this point to prevent the worst from happening to my friend? Can he leave the country?" (Robert Rosen): "He did, actually. He moved to a foreign country. The fear was gone, but the depression was still there." (Robert Rosen, smiling): "The world, the world is a chaotic mess. Life is messy. Life is messy. The world is chaotic. The other part is a more deep-seated thing. It's going to take longer. It's part of him, right? He's been carrying that around maybe since he was three years old. And he's lost the hope, and he's got to come back to it. And he's lost, and he's coming back to it. So if I was working with somebody like that, it would be a little bit of... have a little bit of peacefulness with yourself. I would hand them a sheet that says, 'Here, take a holiday from yourself today and go ride on the roller coaster.' It'd be something like that. So that's why I've gone over to this bit of conversation about there are some understandings. Once you have that, you're in the room with me, and once you have that conversation, you might have a little more peacefulness about it." (Chai Jing): "So maybe the point is about regaining the power and the meaning of life to cure yourself, to heal yourself."</p>
</details>

卢森博士纠正道：“嗯，这不是治愈。柴静，很抱歉，对你来说没有治愈。对他来说也没有治愈。关于这一点，还有其他选择。保持抑郁是非常容易的。这是过去。我活在过去。我抑郁。我知道我的一天会是怎样的，我知道它会如何结束。所以这就是例行公事。所以我有点处于‘不适的舒适区’。我知道那个例行公事是什么。另一方面是未来。现在，在未来我可能不会抑郁，因为我不知道那个故事会如何结束。但这会让人**焦虑**（Anxiety: 对未来不确定性或潜在威胁的担忧）。当你进入当下，进入未知的世界时，因为你不知道它会如何结束，它会带来一点额外的焦虑。就是这样，它就是伴随着这些而来的。怎么可能不呢？如果不是这样，那将是不自然的，因为你不知道，你不知道那会从何而来。这就是这些选择的一部分。他将不再抑郁，但他会对此感到有点焦虑。是的。但这是另一面，这是一种充满恐惧的焦虑，还是一种令人兴奋的、可怕的焦虑，因为我不知道现在会发生什么。所以，也许你的朋友正处于一种结合状态，‘我不知道他，你知道，我已经，你知道，我很快就要给他开账单了。’我认为他的问题是如何停止。他们必须**活在当下**（Living in the Present: 专注于当前时刻，不沉溺于过去或过度担忧未来）。我带着一些想法活在过去，我只是觉得，‘好吧，我必须再次醒来。’我可能在一天中经历这个过程一千次。好的。当你经历它时，你就是活在当下。每次你回到过去，你都会醒来，然后回到当下。这就是那种承诺。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">(Robert Rosen): "Well, it's not a cure. There is no cure for you, Chai. I'm sorry. There's no cure for him either. There are these other choices about that. It's very easy to stay depressed. This is the past. I'm in the past. I'm depressed. I know what my day is going to be like, and I know how it's going to end. So that's the routine. So I'm kind of in the comfort of my discomfort. I know what that routine is. The other side of that is the future. Now, in the future, I might not be depressed because I don't know how that story is going to end. But you make people anxious. When you come into the present, into the unknown world, because you don't know where it's going to end, it comes with a little added anxiety. It's just, that's what it comes with. How could it not? It would be unnatural if it didn't, because you don't know, you don't know where that's going from. And that's part of these choices. He wouldn't be depressed anymore, but he would be a little more anxious about it. Yeah. But this is the side where is it a fear-filled anxiety, or is it a scary, exciting anxiety because I don't know what's going to happen now? So maybe your friend is having a combination of, 'I don't know him, you know, I'm already, you know, he's gonna have to, I'm gonna have to bill him for this pretty soon.' I think the problem for him is how to stop. They have to move into the present. I'm in the past with some of the thought, and I just, it's like, 'Okay, I just have to wake up again.' I might go through that process a thousand times in that day. Okay. While you're going through it, you're being in the present. You're waking up each time you go back to there. You wake up and you come back into the present. This is what that commitment is."</p>

### 呼吁更广泛的讨论

柴静问道：“但是你如何能专注于当下呢？”卢森博士回答：“嗯，通过观察，当下总有一些东西在变化。如果你现在转身看向窗外，我敢打赌，在那一分钟里，那是真实的外面吗？或者那只是，那是真实的外面吗？”柴静补充道：“我猜在那一分钟内，你可能会看到一根枝子动，或者是某些东西在枝子上爬着。这是我们现在的状态。我和卢森博士的谈话是在半年前，我本来无意播出它，可是这段时间我会持续收到很多人的来信，提到他们在承受**政治抑郁症**的痛苦。政治抑郁症是目前仍然没有得到一个准确定义和广泛研究的命题。这是因为心理咨询师在接受培训的时候被严格要求避免谈论政治，这当中也有一定的合理性。他们认为谈论政治会强化社会结构的一种强大压力，增加病人的无力感。但是也有另一种声音说，如果一直回避，一直沉默，这会加剧病人的内疚。这就是为什么卢森博士的文章会在中文世界中得到大量的传播，因为他是极少数直接面对公众谈论这些话题的人。所以，在我们告别之前，他提醒说，他希望在这个领域当中能够有更广泛、更丰富的讨论，因为病人带着痛苦在敲响临床医生的大门，就在此时，就在此地。我还想说，我现在正在……”

<p class="english-text">(Chai Jing): "But how can you focus on the moment?" (Robert Rosen): "Well, by looking, something's always changing in the present. If you were to turn around and look out your window now, I bet there's, for one minute, is that a real outside there or is that just, is that the real outside?" (Chai Jing's narration continues): "I guess in that minute, you might see a branch moving, or something crawling on a branch. This is our current state. My conversation with Dr. Rosen was half a year ago. I originally had no intention of broadcasting it, but during this period, I continuously receive letters from many people mentioning that they are suffering from political depression. Political depression is a proposition that has not yet received an accurate definition and widespread research. This is because psychological counselors are strictly required to avoid talking about politics during their training, which has a certain rationality. They believe that talking about politics will strengthen a powerful pressure from social structures and increase the patient's sense of powerlessness. But there is also another voice that says if they keep avoiding and remaining silent, this will exacerbate the patient's guilt. This is why Dr. Rosen's article has been widely circulated in the Chinese world, because he is one of the very few people who directly face the public to talk about these topics. So, before we said goodbye, he reminded that he hopes there can be broader and richer discussions in this field, because patients are knocking on the doors of clinical doctors with pain, right here, right now. I also want to say, I am currently..."</p>
