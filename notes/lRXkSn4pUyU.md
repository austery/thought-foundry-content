### 拥抱不适：培养自信孩子的起点

演讲者以一个略带“恶心”的个人经历开场——她今天穿的鞋子沾染了各种污垢，从人行道到汽车脚垫，再到加油站的卫生间地板，最后是布满橡皮泥的儿童地毯，甚至鞋底还沾着鼻涕和可能的病毒。这种生动的描述旨在唤起听众的生理反应，如心率加快、肌肉紧绷，以及由前脑岛皮层（anterior insula）激活引发的厌恶感和轻微的作呕反应。她坦言，正是听众的这种不适感，是培养自信孩子的第一个关键步骤。作为一名儿童焦虑和强迫症专家，她将自己定位为“专业的勇气教练”，并表示她以“让孩子感到不适”为生，通过诸如让八岁孩子用针扎她、带孩子进行地下室蜘蛛探险、或与不情愿的青少年玩Uno等方式，来挑战他们的舒适区。

I've walked a lot in these shoes today.
These soles have ground
into the pavement of downtown Minneapolis,
the rubber mats of my car,
the linoleum of a gas station bathroom
and the Play Doh-crusted
carpet of a daycare.
Embedded in the tread,
a smear a toddler booger.
Yeah, a little leftover norovirus maybe.
Maybe if I'm really lucky,
a little fleck of dog poop.
Makes you sick
just thinking about it, right?
Audience: Ooh!
(Laughter)
(Cheers and applause)
So, yeah, that happened.
And while you may not have tasted
what I just tasted,
you felt what I felt.
Your sympathetic nervous system activated,
increasing your heart rate
and tensing your muscles.
Your anterior insula flared,
creating a feeling of disgust.
Little nausea, slight gag reflex.
Am I going to get sick now?
I don't know.
(Laughter)
But I do know this.
I am so glad you're uncomfortable.
Congratulations, truly.
Because that discomfort,
that is the first essential step
to creating confident kids.
And you can trust me on this one.
I make kids uncomfortable for a living.
This week I had an eight-year-old
stab me with a needle, twice,
took a kid into a basement
on a spider safari
and played Uno on the bathroom floor
with an understandably reluctant teen.
It's only Wednesday.
Now I’m not doing this stuff
because I’m an evil psychologist.
I'm doing this because as a pediatric
anxiety and OCD expert,
I'm a professional bravery coach.

### 焦虑的蔓延与“舒适型育儿”的陷阱

演讲者随后讲述了一个名叫萨米（Sammy）的三年级男孩的案例。萨米聪明、好奇、乐观，对机场设计了如指掌，但他却极度害怕蜜蜂。尽管他的大脑理解蜜蜂作为授粉者的重要性，但他的身体却将它们视为带有攻击性的“黄色飞针”，触发了“个人蜜蜂安全协议”，包括避免户外甜食、与花朵保持社交距离，甚至在家庭度假时也选择待在室内。萨米和他的父母尝试了各种方法，如深呼吸和分散注意力，但均无效。父母的反复保证“你不会被蜇”也无法打消萨米的疑虑，他反问：“你怎么知道？”这种恐惧正在一点点吞噬萨米的童年。演讲者指出，她通过各种方式让孩子感到不适，如在超市大声唱生日歌、按“块状级别”给呕吐照片排序，甚至舔自己的脏鞋，这些并非为了好玩，而是源于一种“方法论”。经过十年的临床实践，她发现**暴露疗法**（Exposure Therapy: 一种心理治疗方法，通过让患者逐渐面对其恐惧的事物来减轻焦虑）不仅是儿童焦虑和强迫症的黄金标准疗法，更是一本“秘密育儿手册”，能帮助孩子茁壮成长。

然而，在分享这本手册之前，她强调了我们所面临的严峻现实。根据《儿童健康全国调查》，儿童焦虑症诊断在2016年至2019年间上升了近30%，这还发生在新冠疫情之前。她指出，进化心理学解释了为何孩子焦虑时，成年人也会随之焦虑。她以自己为例，当她两个女儿流露出焦虑时，她的神经系统会立刻进入“战斗或逃跑”模式，肾上腺素飙升，女儿的紧急情况瞬间变成她的紧急情况，促使她去“拯救”孩子。这种本能的反应，即使是专业人士也难以免疫。她将这种行为称为“舒适型育儿”（parenting for comfort），并认为这是我们最自然、最善意却也最“缺陷”的做法。在焦虑治疗领域，这被称为“迁就”（accommodation）。它表现为家长移除家中所有绿色物品（因为绿色代表呕吐），或像萨米父母那样，将家庭活动从户外改为室内。这种模式贯穿了近三十年的育儿趋势，从“直升机育儿”到“温和育儿”，其核心都基于一个错误的观念：健康等同于快乐。

I'd like to tell you about a kid
that I worked with years ago named Sammy.
Sammy was this sweet little third-grade
string bean who lived for adventure.
Bright, curious, optimistic,
could tell you everything
you honestly never needed to know
about airport design.
But Sammy had a fear: bees.
His brain appreciated bees,
vital pollinators.
His body, however, reacted
like they were flying yellow needles
with some anger issues.
As soon as those leaves turned green,
Sammy would initiate his own
personal bee safety protocol.
No sweets outside,
social distancing from the flowers,
even staying inside
during his family's cabin trips.
When Sammy got to me,
he and his parents had tried everything
to get rid of this anxiety.
Deep breathing, distraction.
No luck.
They had also debated the fear endlessly.
His parents would reassure him,
"You won't get stung."
Sammy reminded his parents they were not
fortune telling wizards in four words:
"How do you know?"
This phobia was stealing Sammy's childhood
one sunny summer day at a time.
When I sing Happy Birthday
with a cringing 12-year-old,
as loudly as possible,
in the grocery store produce section,
when I rank order photos
of vomit by chunk level,
or, yes, when I lick my own dirty shoes,
I don't just do it for fun.
Although, believe it or not,
sometimes it's very fun.
I do it for kids like Sammy,
because there is a method to this madness.
And after a decade of clinical practice
helping kids be brave,
it's become clear to me
that the method, exposure therapy,
isn't just the gold-standard treatment
for child anxiety and OCD.
It is a secret parenting playbook
for raising kids that thrive.
I want to share that secret
playbook with you today.
But before we talk about what to do,
we need to talk
about what we are up against.
It's a wild, worried
world out there, folks.
According to the National Survey
of Children's Health,
pediatric anxiety diagnoses
rose by nearly 30 percent
from 2016 to 2019.
And that was before COVID.
But you don't need stats or lists.
You have felt this,
because thanks to evolutionary biology,
when kids get anxious,
adults get anxious too.
Now I have two girls,
and home is the hardest clinic
that I have to work in.
When one of my little gals looks up
at me with the big teary eyes,
aka the mommy bat signal,
my nervous system does
the same thing that yours does.
It responds as though I have discovered
that the kitchen is on fire.
The amygdala, the watchdog
in our brain, starts barking
and the fight-or-flight system kicks in
and adrenaline surges,
and there is this instant
magical transfer of distress.
Her emergency becomes my emergency.
And in an emergency, what do you do?
You rescue the child.
Now I am proof that professional
degrees do not make you immune to this.
In my eldest daughter's
four short years of life,
I have become a one-woman
emotional SWAT team
more times than I can count.
I've answered questions for my daughter
when she clams up with a new adult.
I've sacrificed my sleep
and allowed our little human space heater
into the big bed for the night.
I have forfeited all privacy while peeing.
Because even that closed
bathroom door feels too far away.
Now all of this is what I call
parenting for comfort,
and it is the single most
natural and well-meaning
and deeply flawed thing that we do.
In the anxiety treatment world,
parenting for comfort
has another name: accommodation.
In my office, it looks like the parents
who removed everything
green from the house
because green meant vomit.
In Sammy's case, it looked
like kind, loving parents
who altered family plans
from outdoor fun to indoor fun.
No picnics at the park,
no meals on the deck at the cabin.
Parenting for comfort is not limited
to the parents of anxious kids.
It's also the common thread in the last
30 years of parenting trends,
from the helicopter parenting of yore
to the gentle parenting of today.
All of it is rooted in this idea
that healthy is a synonym for happy.
But I have watched this approach
play out hundreds of times in my office,
and I can tell you,
there are three big problems
with parenting for comfort.
First, it places an incredible
burden on parents.
It turns us into this stressed out member
of the feeling Secret Service
tasked with controlling
something we just can't:
another person's emotional experience.
Second, it teaches kids
that hard feelings are an emergency.
When we cancel that picnic in July
or open the bathroom door mid-stream,
we may not say it, but our actions shout,
“This feeling is a problem.”
Third,
it doesn't work.
We can't eliminate the pain
or mistakes of childhood.
They're a part
of the process of growing up.
We cannot guarantee emotional comfort
when discomfort is a side
effect of being alive.
If life won't promise comfort,
our parenting can't either.

### 转变视角：从舒适到自信的育儿新范式

演讲者提出了一个根本性的转变：从“舒适型育儿”转向“自信型育儿”（parenting for confidence）。其核心在于改变目标——不再是消除焦虑、不确定或痛苦，而是建立**应对能力**（handleability），即一种“我能处理”的深层信念。这正是暴露疗法的精髓，也是培养孩子茁壮成长的关键。这意味着不回避困难情绪，而是去体验它们，并依然能够说：“我能做到。”孩子需要的不是一个舒适的生活，而是“与不适相处”的能力。

那么，如何实现“自信型育儿”呢？演讲者介绍了一个暴露疗法沿用数十年的公式：焦虑（Anxiety）+ 勇气（Bravery）= 自信（Confidence）。她强调，焦虑本身并非问题，而是核心要素，是大脑通过**抑制性学习**（Inhibitory Learning: 大脑通过新经验学习到旧的恐惧反应不再适用，从而更新神经连接的过程）来学习安全感的关键。只有在恐惧存在时，勇气才能重塑大脑。没有人能在不经历困难的情况下，建立起自己能应对困难的信心。她将担忧比作一个“霸道的恶霸”，而通过实践勇气，孩子可以向这个恶霸展示谁才是主导。

研究表明，父母自身行为的改变能够显著影响孩子的焦虑水平。当父母从以迁就来优先考虑舒适，转变为以实践来优先考虑自信，孩子就更有可能迈出勇敢行动的步伐。自信型育儿意味着在“焦虑+勇气=自信”的每一步中支持孩子。这包括：
1.  **创造焦虑机会**：通过冒险来制造焦虑。正如没有人会直接跳入深水区，除非他们被带到泳池边。她建议萨米父母恢复家庭的夏日乐趣，如散步吃冰淇淋、闻花香、在小屋甲板上吃西瓜。
2.  **以身作则**：成为孩子希望看到的勇敢榜样。通过示范来展示孩子能够应对。萨米父母没有强迫他，而是自己走出去，尽管有黄蜂，依然享受西瓜，以此证明“跳进泳池，水是安全的”。
3.  **庆祝勇敢行为**：为孩子的勇敢尝试喝彩并给予奖励。勇敢是艰苦的工作，值得回报。萨米构建了一个“勇气阶梯”来面对恐惧：从蜜蜂图片、视频，到一只死去的蜜蜂标本，最终是真实的蜜蜂。每一步都赢得了“勇气积分”，可兑换去新餐厅的奖励。

Instead of parenting for comfort,
we need to be parenting for confidence.
When you parent for confidence,
you flip the script.
Our goal is not to get rid of anxiety,
uncertainty or distress.
Our goal is to build coping efficacy,
what I call "handleability."
This deep-in-your-bones
belief: “I can handle it.”
That is the heart of exposure therapy
and the key to raising kids that thrive.
Not avoiding hard feelings,
but experiencing them and still saying:
"I can do this."
Our kids don't require a comfortable life.
They need comfort with discomfort.
So how do you do this?
How do you parent for handleability?
When Sammy got to me,
all that he and his parents
had tried hadn't really worked,
and he was waiting to see
if I would waste his time too.
But I surprised him.
Rather than reassurance
or relaxation or distraction,
with Sammy and with hundreds
of other kids,
I used the recipe that exposure
therapists have relied on for decades.
A plus B equals C.
Anxiety
plus bravery
equals confidence.
Notice, anxiety is not the problem.
It's a core ingredient.
It's actually central
to how the brain learns safety
through what's called inhibitory learning.
Bravery only rewires the brain
when fear is present.
No one gets confident
they can handle hard stuff
without handling hard stuff.
I explained to Sammy
that worry is a bossy bully,
but bullies stop messing with you
once you say no.
In order to shrink worry,
he needed to show that bully who's boss
through practice being brave.
Now of course, Sammy was immediately
convinced by my explanation
and was like, "Ah, yes,
Kathryn, absolutely.
Uh, give me some bees."
No. Oh my gosh, he was like,
"Uh, thanks, hot take.
I will consider that."
(Laughter)
But this is where grown ups come in.
A growing body of research
from Yale Child Study Center and others
shows that we, as parents,
can change child anxiety
just by changing our own behavior.
If we parents go from prioritizing
comfort through accommodation
to prioritizing confidence
through practice,
we can make it much more likely
that kids will take that leap
into brave action.
Parenting for confidence
means supporting kids
at each step of the ABC recipe.
It means creating opportunities
for anxiety through adventure.
No kid jumps off the high dive
if you never take them to the pool.
I asked Sammy's parents
to give him some
confidence-building opportunities
by resuming their family's summer fun.
Walk to ice cream, smell the flowers,
eat the watermelon on the cabin deck.
Parenting for confidence also means
be the bravery you wish
to see in your child.
Show your kid that they can
handle this by modeling it.
Do the scary thing.
Sammy's parents didn't make Sammy
go outside on the deck,
but they did go out there and enjoy
some watermelon despite the wasps.
This is jumping in the pool
and showing the water's fine.
Third, we need to celebrate
confidence-building actions.
Cheer for and reward those brave steps.
Brave is hard work,
and hard work deserves reward.
Sammy built a bravery ladder
to face his fears.
It went from bee pictures,
to videos, to Dan.
Dan is a dead bee in a jar in my office.
(Laughter)
And finally, real bees.
Each step earned brave points,
which Sammy cashed in
for trips to new restaurants.

### 成人的勇气：传递信心，成为孩子的锚

“自信型育儿”也意味着家长需要极大的勇气。看着孩子在比赛前恐慌，却仍鼓励他们上场；让孩子去面对“蛇窟”般的中学午餐室；或者像演讲者自己那样，在日托门口强忍泪水，将哭闹的幼儿交给老师。这些行为都要求我们相信孩子有应对的能力，即使他们自己正尖叫着“别赌我”。然而，秘密在于，正如焦虑可以传染给成人，**信心**（Confidence）同样可以传递给孩子。通过**社会参照**（Social Referencing: 儿童通过观察成人来评估情境安全性的行为），如果父母保持冷静和坚定，就能将自己的神经系统“借”给孩子。在孩子经历焦虑的浪潮时，父母的角色不是让他们“下车”，而是成为他们温暖、稳定的“锚”，是过山车上的安全杆，是那个坚定的后盾：“无论发生什么，我都爱你，永远爱你。”

因此，要培养自信的孩子，就让他们去“挣扎”（struggle），而不是“遭受”（suffer）。自信并非来自赞扬或保护，而是来自实践——即使害怕，也要去做。这很难，但值得。因为勇气是会传染的。一个勇敢的行为会点亮下一个，不仅对孩子自己，也对周围的人。一个克服了对蜜蜂恐惧的孩子，不仅能再次在户外玩耍，他们还可能在课堂上举手、尝试参加学校戏剧、在不公面前发声，因为他们开始问：“我还能做什么？”当他们这样做时，其他人也会变得更勇敢。通过勇敢地去做重要的事情，你赋予了他人同样的信心。

这项工作之所以重要，不仅是为了让孩子少些焦虑，更是因为我们的孩子们正在继承一个充满挑战的世界：两极分化的社区、经济动荡、全球不确定性。解决这些问题需要的是那些能够说“这很难，但我能处理”的人，而不是那些在行动前必须感觉良好的人。简而言之，需要的是勇敢的人。自信型育儿不是一种奢侈，而是一种“传承”（legacy）。因为勇敢的育儿造就勇敢的孩子，而勇敢的孩子将是改变世界的人。

最后，演讲者回顾了萨米的故事。那个曾经连散步都不敢带苹果的孩子，如今已能自信地面对世界。她展示了萨米和其他“世界改变者”的照片，并呼吁听众思考：你想让孩子在未来拥有怎样的标志？你将如何为他们指引方向？你准备好“舔鞋”了吗？她以一句振奋人心的话结束：“革命始于一个人有意识地去做一件难事，让别人看见。”她邀请大家一起“变得不适”，一起“茁壮成长”，一起“培养他们勇敢”。

Now at this point, a warning.
Parenting for confidence
is brave parenting.
It asks for bravery from kids, yes,
but it requires bravery from parents.
Watching your kid panic
before the hockey game
and sending them out onto that ice anyway.
Asking them to eat in the den of snakes
that is a middle school lunchroom.
Or if you are me, peeling your protesting
one-year-old off your body,
passing them to a teacher at daycare,
and then walking out the door
before bursting into tears.
This is incredibly emotionally hard.
These actions ask us to place a bet
on our child's ability to cope
when they themselves are screaming,
"Don't bet on me."
But here's the secret.
The same way these anxious kids
can transfer their anxiety to adults,
adults can transfer
their own confidence to kids.
Thanks to social referencing
or how kids look
to adults to gauge safety.
If we stand our ground and remain calm,
we can lend our kids a nervous system.
Our job during that wave of anxiety
is not to get kids off the ride,
but to be their warm, steady anchor.
A lap bar on the roller
coaster of distress.
The secure base that says:
“Come what may, I love you.
I will always love you no matter what."
So, you want confident kids?
Let them struggle.
Not suffer.
Struggle.
Because confidence doesn't come
from praise or protection.
It comes from practice.
Practice being scared and doing it anyway.
It is hard, but it's worth it.
Because here's the best part:
bravery is contagious.
One act of courage
lights the way for the next.
Not just for your kid,
but for the people around them.
The kid who faces their fear of bees
doesn't just play outside again.
They raise their hand in class,
they try out for the school play,
they speak up when something is wrong
because they start to ask:
“What else am I capable of?”
And when they do, someone
else gets a little braver too.
By facing fear to do what matters,
you give others the faith
that they can do the same.
That is why this work matters.
Not just so your child feels less anxious,
but because all of our children
are inheriting a world of hard,
complicated problems.
Polarized communities,
economic disruption,
global uncertainty.
These challenges won't be solved by people
who need to feel good before they act.
They'll be solved by people who can say,
"This is hard,
but I can handle it."
In short, brave people.
Parenting for confidence is not a luxury.
It is a legacy.
Because brave parenting
creates brave kids,
and brave kids are the ones
that will change the world.
So what happened with Sammy?
Audience: Aw.
KH: That is the kid that wouldn’t take
an apple on a walk.
He looks good in the suit, doesn't he?
There he is.
And actually, here he is.
And he is not alone.
(Cheers and applause)
(Applause continues)
(Applause ends)
Friends, meet your world changers.
And while you look up here
at all of this bravery,
think of the kids that you know and love.
What sign do you want that child
to be able to hold six months from now
or 10 years from now?
What sign will you hold
to show them the way?
What shoe are you ready to lick?
(Laughter)
Revolutions begin with one person
doing something hard on purpose
where others can see.
So please, let's get
uncomfortable together.
Let's thrive together.
And let's raise them brave.
Thank you.
(Cheers and applause)
