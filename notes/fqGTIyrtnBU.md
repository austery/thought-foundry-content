### 创业低谷与个人危机：在黑暗中重塑自我

创业之路充满挑战，尤其是在2020年，我曾经历一段极其艰难的时期。有时醒来时甚至看不清东西，感觉自己濒临死亡，却不知原因何在。恰恰在此时，公司的营收也开始放缓。这让我深刻体会到，初创企业成功的概率本就渺茫，而如今在人工智能（AI）的浪潮下，市场变化加速，企业必须时刻保持警惕，不断革新，绝不能停下对市场的反应和适应。一旦变得安逸自满，就很容易被竞争对手超越。

这种危机感也促使我反思领导力。真正的变革往往需要CEO拥有承担巨大风险的决心。我曾采取过非常个人化的决策方式，很少征求他人意见，甚至忽略了不少建议。在某些极端情况下，我们甚至会主动暂停部分业务的营收，以进行战略调整。然而，极少有人，无论是董事会还是其他利益相关者，愿意支持如此激进的举措。这让我明白，要带领企业穿越风暴，必须具备初创公司创始人般的“孤注一掷”的心态，因为他们往往没有太多可以失去的。

I would wake up some days in 2020 and I couldn't see. I think I'm dying. I don't know why. That was about when revenue started to slow too. Startups are so hard, so unlikely to work. Particularly now with AI, there's never a point where you could stop reinventing and stop reacting to the market. If you get comfortable and complacent, someone else will catch up and eat your lunch. It only works when the CEO was willing to risk at all to make giant changes. I acted very unilaterally. I did not look for much input. I ignored a lot of advice. We'd actually like switch off revenue for parts of the business. Very few people and boards and stakeholders are willing to do that. Very few people. So that's the secret. You must be willing to work like a startup founder. Startup founder doesn't have anything to lose. So they act like they've got nothing to lose.

### 拥抱不完美：从傲慢到现实的领导力蜕变

作为一家拥有14年历史、在SaaS领域表现出色的公司Intercom的CEO，我们当前的核心战略聚焦于**Finn**，一个正在从服务型AI代理向客户服务AI代理演进的产品，其目标是掌控整个客户生命周期。我们是全球最大的私营软件公司之一。

回溯我的创业初心，我曾是一个梦想家，深受电视节目中发明家和科学家的启发，对技术带来的未来充满乐观与憧憬。互联网的出现更是让我着迷，它打破了地域限制，让人们能够跨越世界与他人建立连接。我成长于爱尔兰的一个小地方，深受美国文化影响，互联网成为了我连接美国、了解世界的窗口。我渴望创造技术，为世界贡献力量。

然而，创业历程并非一帆风顺，充斥着无数挑战、黑暗的日子，以及对我们所构建事物是否“有效”的焦虑与恐惧。我们曾创下从1到5000万美元年营收（ARR）的最快纪录，仅用两年半时间，这在当时的SaaS领域是相当出色的成就。但这种快速增长也可能导致自满。我意识到，当前一代的创始人必须警惕这一点，不能想当然地认为营收增长是理所当然的，而应深入理解其来源。

那段辉煌的开局无疑极大地满足了我的自尊心和安全感。然而，当营收增长开始放缓时，我在定价策略上犯了错误，这让我感受到了截然相反的境地。那是一次深刻的现实检验。我当时唯一知道的处理方式就是“拥抱黑暗”。我开始怀疑自己，认为自己并非那么出色，甚至可能是一个失败者，过去所有的傲慢和自信都显得虚无。

幸运的是，在经历了一段黑暗时期后，我的自我认知逐渐软化，那个“完美创业者”和“CEO”的身份认同也随之淡去。取而代之的是一个更现实、更能接纳自身错误的人。这反而给了我信心，让我能够放下对未来的担忧去领导。我学会了爱上自己的不完美，并以此为基础前进，发现自己现在的工作效率和幸福感都大大提升了。

I'm only the CEO and founder of Intercom. Well, we're a 14-year-old company. Did very well in the SAS game. Our big big big bet and push right now is on Finn. Finn is a service agent turning into a customer agent. Really the goal of Finn is to own the entire customer life cycle. We're one of the largest private software companies in the world. I was a dreamer. I watched TV shows about inventors and scientists. There was two shows I watched. One was called Beyond 2000 and one was called Tomorrow's World. And in the early '9s, the future was still very bright. There was so much excitement and optimism for what technology would bring to the world. And everyone was just, yeah, really eager for what may come. So these shows were about flying cars, about a future where we may get all our nutrition from eating little tablets. It was like fantastical kind of things and that really just inspired me and just fed my imagination. And so yeah, I knew I wanted to be in technology. I wanted to be an inventor. What was most exciting about the internet was abilities that afforded people to connect with others across the world. I grew up in Ireland in a small little part of Ireland. Like a lot of Irish people and a lot of people around the world longed for America because all of our culture, all of our movies was American. And the internet was a little way for me to connect with America, American people. My future, I wanted it to be about creating technology, somehow playing a part and being useful. And there was something about the internet that really drew me in, offered me an opportunity to connect with people in the wider world and get outside of my little part of Ireland. The story of Intercom was one of many challenges, many dark days, a lot of anxiety and fear over whether or not the thing we're building is valid. Will it all work out? We're the fastest to go from 1 to 50 million air or since Salesforce. We did it in two and a half years. These days that's nothing. You know, in the AI days, there's people hitting up 100 million in a year in some crazy crazy cases. But back in the good old SAS days, one of 150 million or in 2 and 1/2 years was pretty damn good. But in some ways, this crazy growth that happens to you can leave you a little complacent. That's something that the current crop of founders need to watch out for, which is that they shouldn't take their revenue growth for granted. They should learn to understand where it's coming from. This hot brilliant start certainly did wonders for my ego and insecurities. The one of 50 million or in 2 and 1/2 years or whatever it was, faster than every other company but Salesforce, I felt great. But when revenue growth started to slow, I made some mistakes with our pricing. I felt the opposite of great. That was a real reality check for me. The only way I knew how to deal with it was embrace the darkness a little. I didn't know I was following this wisdom, but I was starting to believe like, oh, maybe I'm not so great. Maybe I am a failure. Maybe all this hubus and confidence was [ __ ] actually. And thankfully after really going to that darker place, I found my ego softened and my identity as this perfect entrepreneur and CEO faded and what was left was a far more realistic person who was comfortable with his mistakes. It gave me the confidence to lead with without worrying about what might come next. then learning to love my imperfections and then moving forward and embracing the imperfections, finding that I'm just so much happier and better at what I do now that I'm happy and perfect.

### 重塑企业文化：以价值观驱动的组织优化

我曾于2020年因病卸任CEO，在那段离开公司的几年里，公司实际上缺乏明确的战略方向。我们曾在2017年初以12.5亿美元的估值融资，并在2018年6月我生病时，公司估值已达50亿美元。我后来才得知，我当时是因蜱虫叮咬而患病。2020年，我曾经历视力模糊，如同黑暗的模糊一片，这对我处理邮件和文件造成了极大困扰。最终，我决定必须做出改变。

当时公司正处于一个危险的境地，内部充斥着对文化、社会及政治议题的过度关注，以及大量的内斗和相互指责。身处风暴中心时，感受并不好，也难以 pinpoint 问题所在。但从外部视角，我能看到公司可以做得更好。回归基本原则，将是极其有益且重要的。我们的核心使命是打造卓越的产品，赚取丰厚的利润，让公司、股东和客户都满意。这并不难。

为此，我建立了一套新的绩效管理体系。我们每季度会根据员工的工作表现和行为是否符合新价值观进行评级。对于那些在践行价值观方面表现杰出的员工，我们会给予丰厚的薪酬、股权和奖金，并大力表彰他们。这些人是我们希望留住的核心力量。而对于那些不匹配的员工，我们会礼貌而体面地感谢他们，并给予慷慨的遣散费。如此季度循环往复，优秀人才自然脱颖而出，不合适的人则离开，从而迅速建立起一个高度协同、强大的组织。

尽管采取了如此“激进”的措施，但在我推行新价值观和绩效管理体系的18个月后，我们进行了一次匿名的员工敬业度调查。结果显示，几乎所有员工（约1200人）都对公司领导层（包括我）、价值观、政策和产品战略表示高度认同，只有1-2%的员工持有不同意见。这是我从未在其他公司听过的惊人结果，甚至在我们公司过去也未曾达到过。

打造一个为卓越而生、让优秀人才得以专注并发挥才华、同时允许他们获得丰厚回报且不容许任何干扰的组织，能够营造出一种非常快乐且高度协同的企业文化。如果有人不喜欢这个体系，市面上还有许多其他优秀的公司可供选择，比如谷歌。我们只是不适合他们的地方。他们或许不会当月离开，但最终还是会选择离开。从大局来看，我们不仅帮助了自己，也在为他们铺就找到更适合自己道路的起点。

当人们开始展现真实的自我，并分享自己的理念时，他们会感到更快乐。这并非CEO的典型做法，但虚伪终究会暴露，人们会开始质疑你、不信任你。真诚、诚实、真实性，这才是前进的方向。

I left as CEO in 2020 when I was sick and during the couple years that I was gone, there really was no strategy. We raised in early 2017 finally at a $ 1.25 $5 billion valuation. And then I got sick in June 2018. So it was about 18 months later. I found out much later that I got bitten by a tech. I would wake up some days in 2020 and I couldn't see. It was kind of like a dark blur and that was not ideal for like the emails that I would have to answer, the documents I have to work on. And eventually I was just like screw this. Enough was going wrong. I think I'm dying. I don't know why. Oh no. That was about when revenue started to slow too. Revenue growth was decelerating dramatically. The company was in a really dangerous place internally. There was a lot of focus on cultural issues, societal issues, political issues, a lot of infighting, a lot of judgment. When you're in the middle of it, in the middle of that storm, doesn't feel good, but you can't really put your finger on what's going on. But from the outside, from a bit of a distance, I could see that we can do better. Going back to basics will be very fruitful and important for the company. Our only mission is to make incredible products, make a [ __ ] ton of money, make us and our shareholders very, very happy, make our customers happy, too. It's not that hard. I then created a new performance management structure. We quarterly would grade every employee based not just on their work against their goals, but also their behavior against these new values. And people who were exemplary against these values, we'd pay them a ton of money, equity, bonuses, promotions. We would celebrate and prop up these people. These are the people you want to keep. And the people that didn't fit, we'd politely, graciously thank them, send them on their way with a generous uh servants payment. And you do that quarter after quarter, all the good people rise to the top. All the people who are a bad fit are gone. You very quickly end up with a very aligned, strong organization. Despite that aggression, 18 months after I instituted the new values and the new performance man management structure, we ran a anonymous employee engagement survey where all the company were allowed to rate uh the leaders including me, our values, our policies, product strategy, how much did they agree with it, how much did they disagree? For each question, there was only one or two% of the entire population of the company, about 1,200 people who disagreed with any single point. And that is a result that I haven't heard from another company, but we never even achieved at this company in the past. creating a company designed for greatness and for great people to focus and do brilliant work and allow them to make a bunch of money and accepting no distractions or [ __ ] makes for a very happy aligned culture. If people don't like the system, there's so many other great companies out there, including companies like Google. They're over there. We're just the one that isn't. Maybe they were not going to choose to leave this month, but they would have left eventually. And so big picture, not only are we helping ourselves, but we're setting them on their path to find something they're better aligned with. Everyone's happier when you start to be authentic and you share more about who you are and what you stand for. And that's not the typical playbook of a CEO, but the inauthenticity eventually seeps out and people start to question you and not trust you. Truth, honesty, authenticity um is the way forward.

### AI驱动的颠覆与重生：押注Finn的战略转型

一些上一代的优秀软件品牌如今似乎迷失了方向，失去了焦点，甚至陷入了负增长的泥潭。对于科技公司和创业者而言，一个痛苦的现实是，尤其是在AI时代，你永远不能停止革新和对市场的反应。一旦陷入安逸和自满，就必然会被后来者居上。

我们之所以能够实现戏剧性的业务反弹，部分原因在于我们重新找回了那种专注和“不留情面”的决心，这确实带来了丰厚的回报。这只有在CEO愿意承担一切风险、并从所有利益相关者和董事会那里获得充分的道德授权，去进行颠覆性的、激进的、甚至可以说是“暴力”的变革时才能实现。如果CEO试图“不得罪人”，不破坏现有营收，那么公司只会沿着既定的轨迹缓慢前行。

我曾做出过一项大胆的决定：在数年内，我们将放弃数千万美元（约6000万美元）的潜在营收。我们甚至主动“关闭”了部分业务的收入来源，以便将精力集中在其他领域。我们聚焦于某些特定业务，并引入了AI元素，这带来了史诗级的营收增长。与此同时，其他业务部门的营收增长则一度陷入负值。极少有人、董事会或利益相关者愿意做出这样的牺牲，尤其是那些被聘来“维护稳定”的职业CEO。

这就是秘密所在：**重塑与重生**的过程，既是破坏性的，也是建设性的。你必须愿意“打碎鸡蛋”。对于年轻的创始人，我认为重要的是要**测试你的直觉**。不要害怕跟随你的“第六感”去尝试，因为只有在实践中，你才能校准它、了解它。如果你发现自己完全无法独立做出决策，那么你可能就不是一个真正的创始人。因为创始人的本质就是敢于**押注自己**。

当AI出现，我们开始构建**Finn**——我们的AI代理时，我们意识到，由于AI代理能够承担人类的工作，那么人类将不再需要那些用于完成工作的软件。这些AI代理对我们现有的业务构成了巨大的颠覆。我们将其视为一个威胁，也是一个机遇。当时我们别无选择。我们恰好处于业务发展不那么顺利的境地，这反而给了我们一个绝佳的机会。

那些最危险的CEO和公司，往往是那些**缺乏焦点但又勉强维持运营**的。如果你只是“过得去”，那么你就没有太多空间去冒险。但如果你“过得不好”，大家就会说：“好吧，你需要一个计划。我们现在就需要一个计划。放手去做吧！”于是，我们抓住了这个机会，投入了尽可能多的资金，因为我们急需一个新的方向。

当时，我们决定“押注100万美元来转向AI”，这在公司内部引起了争议。但事后看来，这几年的发展已经证明了我们的远见。未来真正属于**人类+AI**的结合。我不希望描绘一个过于理想化的美好世界，变革总是伴随着挑战，有些会很艰难。但人类总能从中蓬勃发展。即使技术曾导致一些工作岗位消失，但被取代的往往是最重复、最乏味、最危险的工作。技术始终在**补充人类**，让我们变得更好。

在我所处的客户体验领域，我也希望确保这一点。初创企业极其艰难，成功率极低。如果你致力于解决一个无法用全新、卓越产品以令人惊叹的方式解决的问题，那么你需要新的想法和方法。人们可能理解一个问题，但缺乏构建优秀产品的创造力，或者缺乏那种“品味”。有些人拥有绝佳的品味，能够打造出极其优雅的界面，但却未能深刻理解需要解决的巨大问题。伟大的创始人能够将这两者结合起来，而这实际上非常罕见，比目前市场上获得融资的初创公司数量还要稀少。

生命短暂，人们渴望与那些充满激情的人为伍，并从中获得启发。回想你生命中那些让你充满动力的时刻，即使你从未考虑过为某人工作。当一个人自己充满激情时，这种情绪是会传染的。同样，当他们快乐时，这种快乐也会传染。人们渴望感受到这种热情，而能够真实地分享这种热情，在我看来，是伟大领导力的秘诀。

没有哪个伟大的创始人没有经历过挣扎。我曾有过极度的黑暗、羞耻、懊悔和自我憎恨的时刻。现在回望，虽然当时痛苦不堪，但它们已成为我故事的一部分。我认为，许多困难都是冒险旅程的一部分，最终会以某种方式让你受益。但我还是要说：**更多地相信自己，跟随你的直觉。你拥有良好的本能。或许你每10次中有1次会出错，但其他9次却能带来光明。倾听你内心的声音，停止过度思考，停止过度合理化，停止试图找到一个被所有利益相关者、团队成员和董事会验证过的“正确”解决方案。跟随你的直觉，做你认为正确的事，勇敢地押注自己。**

Some of the great software brands of the previous generation now have kind of lost their way, their focus. Some of them are in negative growth territory. The painful reality for technology companies, for people who would start them, is that particularly now with AI, there's never a point where you can stop reinventing and stop reacting to the market. If you get comfortable and complacent, someone else will catch up and eat your lunch. And so part of our secret for how we've dramatically reacelerated now is that we brought back that focus and that ruthlessness and it really paid off. It only works when the CEO is willing to risk it all. When they have full moral authority from all their stakeholders and their board to make giant changes, dramatic, aggressive, violent changes. Because if they instead are trying to optimize for not rocking the boat, not damaging old revenue, they will just stay on the trajectory that they had been on. I actually decided that many tens of millions, I think something like 60 million ore, we'd actually give away over a number of years. We'd actually like switch off revenue for parts of the business so that we could focus on other ones. We focused on some specific parts of the business and then introduced this AI element which brought epic revenue growth there. There was other parts of the business where revenue growth was negative for a while. Very few people and boards and stakeholders are willing to do that. Very few people particularly professional CEOs who are hired to not break things. So that's the secret. The process of reinvention and rebirth is highly destructive as well as constructive. You have to be willing to crack a lot of eggs. For younger founders, I think what's important is to test your instinct. Don't be unafraid to just go with your gut and try it out cuz you won't calibrate against it or learn about it until you're unless you're trying it. And if you find yourself entirely unable to make decisions on your own, you're not a founder. Cuz the thing that typifies founders is that they are willing to bet on themselves. When AI came and we started to build Finn, which is our AI agent, we realized that because the agent does the work that the humans do, that the humans are not going to need the software they use to do the work. That these agents were highly disruptive to our existing business. We saw as a threat and an opportunity. We really didn't have any choice. Now, we had the benefit of the fact that our business was not doing so well. So, we needed an opportunity. The worst positioned CEOs and companies were those who were unfocused, but they were doing kind of okay. If you're doing kind of okay, there's less room to get crazy and take big risks. But if you're kind of not doing so well, everyone's like, "All right, you've got a plan. We need a plan. Go for it." So, we jumped on this and spent as much money as we could because of the opportunity, the risk, and we really needed a new a new direction. It was actually controversial when we said, "We're going to bet a million dollars of our own money on pivoting to AI." It was controversial back then, but I think that the couple years since then have proven us right. The future really is humans plus AI. I don't want to be polyianish or just imagine this bright, glistening, perfect world. There will be change and some of the change will be hard. But we've always continued to flourish. Even while technology has put people out of work, the work it's taken has been the most repetitive, demeaning, dangerous work, technology has always complemented humanity and made us uh better. Yeah. Within my little little world of customer experience, I want to make sure we do that, too. Startups are so hard, so unlikely to work. If you're working to solve a problem that can't be solved in an incredibly new way with a brilliant product, you need a new idea and a new approach. People can understand a problem but not have the ingenuity required to build an excellent product or have that taste. where people can have brilliant tastes and be expert crafts people, build incredibly elegant interfaces, but not actually understand deeply a giant problem that needs to be solved. Great founders can marry those two things together. And that's actually really rare. It's far more rare than the number of startups that are out there being funded right now. Life is short. People want to be around and inspired by people who are themselves inspired. Think about periods in your life, even when you've not considered working for someone. When someone themselves is excited, it's infectious. But when they're happy, it's infectious. And people want to feel that passion and an ability to share that authentically is the secret to great leadership in my opinion. There's no great founder that hasn't gone through these struggles. I have had moments of severe darkness, embarrassment, regret, selfhate, and now I look back at them and I'm like, I mean, it was [ __ ] at the time, but it's part of my story now. And so, yeah, I just think that a lot of these difficulties are just part of the adventure and will eventually stand to you one way or another. But I'd say believe in yourself more. Follow your gut. You've got good instinct. Maybe you're wrong one in five or 10 times, but the other times are really light, right? Listen to yourself. Stop overthinking. Stop overrationalizing. Stop trying to come up with the right solution as verified by every stakeholder and everyone on your team and everyone on your board. Go with your gut. Do what you think is right. Have the bravery to bet on yourself.
