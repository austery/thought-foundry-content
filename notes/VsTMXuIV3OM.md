title: 娜塔莉·道森：五年收入翻十倍的PPF框架与成功心态

### 财富的真相：为何努力工作未得回报？

**主持人：** 娜塔莉，对于刚刚点开这段对话的观众来说，你认为他们留下来倾听我们今天将要讨论的内容，以及你整个职业生涯所理解的一切，为什么是重要的？

**娜塔莉：** 如果你是一个非常努力工作、投入了大量精力和能量，却没有相应财富可以展示的人，那么这次对话就很重要。因为财富应该来自于在正确的问题上努力工作。所以你必须问自己一个问题：我每天都在解决什么问题？无论你是组织中的团队成员、领导者，还是企业主，你都应该能够客观地指出“我在这里的工作产生了这样的结果”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: Natalie. For my viewers that have just clicked on this conversation, what is the reason that you think it's important for them to stay and listen to what we're going to talk about today? and all of the things that you've spent your career understanding.</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: If you are somebody who has really struggled with working hard and putting in the effort and the energy, but you don't actually have wealth to show for it. This conversation is important because wealth should come from hard work on the right set of problems. And so you have to ask yourself the question, what problems do I work on every single day? And whether you're a team member in an organization, whether you're a leader in an organization, a business owner in an organization, you should be able to objectively point at my work here generated this result.</p>
</details>

因此，如果我对这个结果不满意，意味着我没有创造出我想要的财富和收入，那么很可能你花费时间和精力解决的问题与你增加财富的实际目标没有关联。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so if I'm upset with this result, meaning I haven't made the wealth, I haven't created the income that I want, it would make sense that where you're spending your time and the problems that you're solving are not tied to your actual goal of increasing your wealth.</p>
</details>

谈到财富，我认为我们正处于一场全球性的财富危机中。关于金融素养，以及谁在赚钱、他们如何赚钱、他们把时间花在什么地方，存在太多的困惑和误解。因此，我非常期待在这次对话中揭示那1%的顶尖人士在时间、投资、技能和心态上所使用的策略，这些策略与那99%似乎无法取得成功、创造他们一直渴望的财富的人截然不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when it comes to wealth, I do think that we are in a wealth crisis across the globe. I think that there is so much confusion and misunderstanding about financial literacy and what's actually happening with who is making money, how they're making money, what they're spending their time on. And so this conversation I'm very much looking forward to unpacking what are the strategies that people use the 1% for their time, for their investments, for their skills, for their mindset that are just different than 99% of people who can't seem to get ahead and create the wealth that they've always wanted.</p>

### 从零到九位数：商业成功的核心原则

**主持人：** 那么，你现在的业务是什么？规模有多大？它具体做什么？

**娜塔莉：** 在过去六年中，我联合创立了两家公司，如今它们的估值都达到了九位数。一家是管理咨询投资公司，名为**Cardone Ventures**（一家由Grant Cardone和Natalie Dawson共同创立的管理咨询和投资公司），我们帮助小企业主成长和扩大他们的组织。我每天都与那些年收入300万美元的企业主合作，他们想知道如何成为少数能够拥有年收入500万或1000万美元企业的人，因为他们意识到年收入300万并不能真正带来财务安全。这家公司成立于2019年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: And so as you sit here now, what is your business? What's the scale of the business? And uh what does it do?</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: Yeah, over the last six years, I co-founded two businesses that are both nine figures today. One is a management consulting investment firm. It's called Cardone Ventures, and we help small business owners grow and scale their organizations. So, I work with business owners on a daily basis who will be doing $3 million in annual revenue. They want to know, how do I become one of the fewer that is able to have a $5 million a year business or a $10 million a year business? because they really realized that $3 million a year doesn't actually create financial security. And that business was started in 2019.</p>
</details>

我们的第二家公司是**10X Health**（一家由Natalie Dawson等人共同拥有的健康公司），我们在2023年收购了一家健康企业，如今它正在帮助世界各地的人们，并且也是一家九位数的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then our second business, 10X Health, we purchased a health business back in 2023 and today is helping people all over the world and it's a nine figure business.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 在你的第一家公司，你与多少位企业主合作过？

**娜타莉：** 参与过我们项目的企业主总数超过15,000人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: So you're on that first business. How many business owners have you worked with?</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: Total business owners that have come through our programs would be over 15,000.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 你帮助他们解决哪些方面的问题？

**娜타莉：** 好问题。我们提供教育、咨询、服务和投资。你可以把我们想象成面向小企业的麦肯锡。我们对他们当前的市场、业务、产品、服务和 offerings 进行逆向工程分析，然后以实际服务的形式回馈给他们，比如我们会为他们做市场营销、招聘人员、处理簿记。但我们业务中也有一个庞大的活动部分，我们培训企业主如何自己招聘，这样他们就不需要雇佣我们来做。我其实更希望人们不雇佣我们来做这些，因为我认为企业主和团队内部的领导者掌握这些能力至关重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: what what are the range of things you're helping them with?</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: Great question. So, there's education. Yeah. There's consulting, there's services, and there's investing. So, think of us like the McKenzie for small businesses. We reverse engineer their current market, what they're doing, what their products, services, offerings are, and we give back to them either in the form of actual services where we will do their marketing for them, we will recruit people for them, we will do their bookkeeping for them. But then we also have a massive events component of our business where we train business owners on how to hire, how to recruit themselves. So they don't need to hire us to do it. I actually prefer it when people don't hire us to do this because I think it's so important for business owners and the leaders inside those teams to actually get the competence in that skill.</p>
</details>

如果企业主不懂得如何阅读**P&L**（Profit and Loss Statement: 损益表，一种财务报表，总结了公司在特定时期内的收入、成本和费用）和资产负债表的重要性，他们总是会把这项工作推给别人。到某个时候，这种做法就不再奏效了。因为他们自己不懂这项技能，只能信任别人。比如，我信任史蒂文，他看起来很棒，我在教堂认识他，我就让他来做。但我不知道史蒂文只懂得如何处理300万美元业务的账目，而我需要的是一个1000万美元的业务。如今没有任何教育体系能帮助企业主识别这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If if business owners don't understand how to read a P&L and the importance of a balance sheet, they're always going to abdicate that work to somebody else. And at some point, that is not going to work for them any longer because I don't actually know what that skill is. So, I'm trusting that Steven can come into my business. Steven seems great. I know him from church. I'm just going to let Stephen do this. But, I don't know that Steven only knows how to do this to a $3 million business. And I need it to be a $10 million business. there's no education system that exists for business owners to help them identify that today.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 回到2019年，你现在所知的商业成功基本原则，与当时相比，有哪些根本性的不同？你认为区分那15000名企业主成功与否的根本因素是什么？

**娜塔莉：** 我最终认为这归结于经商者的品格。因为如果你看那些可以合作的人，要想做成一件真正成功的事业是非常具有挑战性的。即使是世界上最好的商业模式，你搞定了市场营销，搞定了运营，可以规模化，但如果这个人品不行，不道德，不守规矩，不想赢，那就不行。对我来说，这三件事是相辅相成的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: So if I jumped back to 2019, what is the difference like fundamental difference in the principles of how to be successful in business that you know now that you wouldn't have known then? Like what are the glaring principles? I often think that like the further you go down any path, it becomes more and more clear what the like fundamental rules of the game are. And at the very beginning, those are just hypotheses. So, what are like the fundamental things you've learned about what differentiates those 15,000 people that you've interfaced with that are business owners um makes some of them successful and the others unsuccessful?</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: I ultimately think that this comes down to the character of the person that is doing the business. Because if you look at people that you can partner with in business, it is incredibly challenging to make something truly successful. Even if it's the best business model in the world, you figured out marketing, you figured out operations, you can scale it. If the person is a piece of [ __ ] and if the person is not somebody who is ethical and is somebody who's compliant and isn't somebody who wants to win, to me those three things go hand in hand because it to me it doesn't matter what the business model is.</p>
</details>

商业模式是什么并不重要。你可以给我一个屋顶公司、一个暖通空调公司、一个健康公司或一个营销机构。我过去认为正确的原则，很多在过去六年里依然成立，比如会计的标准做法和招聘方法。但过去六年我痛苦地学到的是，一切都关乎与你共事的人，你选择的合作伙伴，以及你允许进入你核心圈子的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The principles that I thought to be true, many of them have held true over the last six years since 2019. Many of them are still very applicable around standard practices for accounting and how you recruit people. Certain tips and tools help with different platforms that you can use for these things, but for the most part, those things actually haven't changed. But what I've learned painfully over the last 6 years is everything is about the people that you do business with and the partners that you choose and the people that you allow in your inner circle.</p>
</details>

我可以看着最出色的企业主来到我们这里，她渴望成功，对未来充满期待，她会记下所有笔记并回家实施。但如果她的生活中有某个拖后腿的人——可能是配偶，可能是孩子，更糟糕的是她花钱雇来帮忙的员工——他们就会阻碍她实现目标和发挥潜力。这就是我发现的问题所在，无论商业模式多好，你给某人所有的书籍、培训和完整的行动手册，他们都会失败。要么因为他们自己不是那样的人，要么因为他们在业务中被那些只会成为他们障碍的人包围了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I can watch the most incredible business owner come into our organization. She's wanting to win. She's excited about what the future can look like. She's going to take all of the notes and actually go home and implement those things. But if she has somebody in her life, say it's a spouse, say it's a kid, worse yet it's an employee that she's paying to help her. Like that's the irony. You pay people to help you and yet when they're actually on your team, they do things that detract from your ability to achieve your goals and to reach your potential. That's where I find doesn't matter what the business model is, doesn't matter. You can give all of the books, all of the training, the full playbook to somebody, they're going to fail because either they aren't that person or they've surrounded themselves inside their business with people who will just be stops to them and continually stop their ability to grow and to reach for more, reducing that person's confidence in themselves and their business stays stuck.</p>

### A级人才的筛选法则：三步面试法

**主持人：** 如果人是长期成功和商业发展的最重要因素，你在人身上寻找什么？在你看来，什么样的人是A级玩家？你如何筛选他们？

**娜塔莉：** 我使用一个三步面试流程。第一步是文化面试。我更想了解他们是否与我们的组织价值观一致，是否目标导向，而不是纠结于他们能否胜任工作的技术细节。在雇佣某人之前，你能问的最好的问题是：他们未来五年的目标是什么？并且要得到一个真实的答案。我不在乎你有什么技能和经验，如果你没有目标，我不会雇佣你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: If people are the most important thing for long-term success and for business, what are you looking for in people? What makes someone an A player in your view? And how do you how do you filter them out? Because a lot of people go off their vibes and if I've learned anything over the last 10 years is that we're all riddled with our own biases and insecurities. So we end up aiming in a certain direction whether that's for better or for worse. So what's your process of finding exceptional people?</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: I use a three-step interview process. So the three steps for me is a first a cultural interview. I want to understand more so than me trying to get into the technicalities of can they do the work. Are they aligned with our organization? Are they goal oriented? The best question that you can ask somebody inside a business before you hire them, what are their five-year goals and actually get a real answer. I don't really care what skills and experiences you have. If you don't have goals, you're I'm not hiring you.</p>
</details>

第二步是技术面试，我希望让这个人尽可能接近实际工作。如果你是销售人员，我想看你打销售电话。如果你是平面设计师，在我们组织，我们不会给你冗长的简报和两周时间去思考。我们会让你当场做一个演示，如果你说需要两天时间思考，或者不知道如何使用Adobe或Canva，我就不能雇佣你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then I move straight into a technical interview where I want to get the person as close to the work as possible. So if you're going to be a salesperson, I want to see you make a a sales call. I'm going to give you a list of 50 people to call. I want to listen to you call those people. If you are a graphic designer in our organization, we do not do briefs. We are not the type of people that are going to say you get all of this time to be able to think through this whole process and this whole journey and we're going to give you two weeks to do this. For us, we are turnurning content constantly because that's the world that we live in for the amount of ads that need to be created, presentation decks. It can't take a bunch of time. And so if the person when I do a case study interview and I have them actually make a presentation in front of me says that they need two days to think about this and they can't assemble some form of a presentation or a graphic for an ad. They don't know how to use Adobe or Canva or whatever the platform is, I I can't really hire the person because I know that they don't have that skill.</p>
</details>

最后一步是核心价值观面试。对我来说，团队成员在加入组织前，能否展示出他们真正理解并认同我们的核心价值观是至关重要的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the final one is a core values interview. And for me, our team's ability to demonstrate ahead of time, ahead of joining the organization that they actually understand and are in alignment with our core values is essential.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 你如何测试一个人的核心价值观？

**娜塔莉：** 我会让他们举例说明他们过去是如何体现我们公司核心价值观的，并向我们的领导团队展示。在Cardone Ventures的前100名团队成员中，我听取了每一次核心价值观的陈述。如果一个人不能展示并具体说出，“我能够产生X数量的潜在客户，并以Y的转化率转化他们”，他们可能对自己所说的一无所知，并且在这个环境中会非常艰难。我相信这是企业主的责任。你必须掌控你的文化和环境。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: How do you test someone's core values?</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: Well, I asked them to give me times where they have exemplified the core values that we have and they present it to our leadership team. For the first 100 team members at Cardone Ventures, I listen to every single core values presentation. the person can't demonstrate and actually say, "Oh, I was able to generate x amount of leads and convert them at y percentage." They probably don't know what they're talking about and they're gonna have a really hard time in the environment. And I do believe that this is the business owner's responsibility. You have to own your culture and your environment.</p>
</details>

### 改变人生的目标设定法：PPF框架

**主持人：** 如果家里有人对自己的目标不太清楚，他们应该怎么做？

**娜塔莉：** 我有一个三步法来设定目标，我已经向成千上万的人推广过。这个三步框架真正改变了我的生活，因为它让我能够为目标创建不同的类别。这个过程被称为**PPF框架**（Personal, Professional, Financial goals: 一种将个人目标分为个人、职业和财务三个维度的设定方法）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: But if someone at home isn't quite clear on their goals, what what should they be doing?</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: I have a three-step methodology for goal setting that I have rolled out to thousands of people. And this three-step framework has really transformed my life because it allows me to create buckets for goals. And the process is called personal goals, professional goals, and financial goals.</p>
</details>

在与团队成员和企业主进行了上千次关于他们目标的对话后，我可以说，我从未发现任何一个目标超出这三个范畴。但许多人遇到的挑战是，在除夕夜，他们开始列出所有他们想完成的美好事情和想成为的人，这变成了一场非常空泛的对话。他们没有真正优先考虑：个人层面，成功是什么样的？职业层面，成功是什么样的？财务层面，成功是什么样的？以及一年后、三年后、五年后这些目标会是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And after having over a thousand of these conversations personally where I've interviewed team members and business owners and team members of business owners about their goals, what I can say is I've never found a goal that is outside of those three buckets. But the challenge many people run into is on New Year's Eve, they start to list out all of the a lovely things that they would like to accomplish and who they want to be. And it becomes this very esoteric conversation. Instead of really prioritizing personally, what does success look like? Professionally, what does success look like? Financially, what does success look like? And what would those targets be in one year from now, 3 years from now, and 5 years from now?</p>
</details>

这三个类别在短期内很容易思考。一年对大多数人来说非常直接。三年后就开始变得有些模糊。而五年后，大多数人都很难想象。但唯一不变的是，五年后，我们都会老五岁。我今天32岁，五年后，我肯定会是37岁。那么，37岁的娜塔莉是谁？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because those three buckets become easy to think about in the short term. One year for most people, super straightforward. They're like, "Oh, I'd like to make an additional $10,000. Maybe I'd like a promotion here." Three years starts to get a little bit more nebulous. And after having over a thousand of these conversations, 5 years for most people they have a hard time thinking with. But the one constant is in 5 years from now, guess what? We're going to be 5 years older. I am 32 years old today. In 5 years from now, for certain, I will be 37 years old. And so, who is Natalie at 37?</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 她是谁？

**娜塔莉：** 她是个狠角色。37岁的娜塔莉掌控着她的环境，能够做出我现在财务上还无法做出的许多金融投资，因为我想能够仅仅因为我能做到，就给慈善机构开一张百万美元的支票。理想情况下，我希望那张支票是1000万或5000万美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: Who is she?</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: She's a [ __ ] badass. Natalie is in control of her environment. Natalie is able to make a lot of financial investments that I'm not in the position financially to make today because I want to be able to write a million dollar check to charity just because I can. I'd ideally like that check to be 10 or $50 million.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 当你说PPF，个人、职业、财务时，我应该用什么具体方式把它写下来吗？

**娜塔莉：** 好问题。理想情况下，个人目标在最上面，下面分设一年、三年和五年的格子。接下来是职业目标，同样分一年、三年、五年。最后是财务目标，也是一年、三年、五年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: And when you say PPF, personal, professional, financial, is there any specific way that I should write this down? Is it just do I just think about in 5 years from now, what are my personal, professional, and financial goals? And then I write that down on a piece of paper, for example.</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: Great question. Ideally, personal is at the top, with a bucket for one year, three year, and fiveyear. Then the next is professional, one year, three year, 5 year. Financial one year, three year, five year.</p>
</details>

### 从焦虑到自信：心态重塑之路

**主持人：** 你用了“狠角色”这个词。一个狠角色的心态是怎样的？你一直都是这样吗？

**娜塔莉：** 我一直想成为这样的人，但今天我就是这样的人。20岁时，我因为别人对我的看法而充满焦虑和恐惧。我害怕如果我成功了，未来会受到评判。因为我内心有一部分在想，万一我只是因为嫁给了一个成功的人才成功的呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: And you know, you use the word badass. What is the mindset of a badass? Like, have you always been like this?</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: I always wanted this, but today I am this. At 20 years old, I was crippled with anxiety and fear about what others thought of me, about this decision that I made to be in a relationship with somebody who was older than me, and thinking that for the rest of my life, somebody was going to think that, oh, she just married her way to the top. She slept her way to success. She's not actually very smart. She's just a gold digger and she took the easy way out. And so 20-year-old me was actually terrified of being in front of people, was terrified of the future judgment that would come if I was successful. Because I think there was a part of me that thought to myself, well, what if I am only successful because I married somebody who is successful?</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 是什么改变了？

**娜塔莉：** 这种气场来自于设定目标，获得我可以证明的“数据”，让别人看到的不是我个人和我的生活选择，而是实实在在的结果。所以第一个结果是能够招聘人才。我想拥有一个具体的数据，证明我招聘了X数量的人。因此，我懂得如何招聘、面试、入职，以及如何创造一个成功的文化，因为结果证明了这一点。所以无论你喜欢我还是不喜欢我，你都无法抹去这个数据。我开始痴迷于做那些能为我带来数据的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: What changed? What happened? How did you acquire such an aura?</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: I think the aura came from targeting, getting stats that I could prove that let somebody not see me and my life choices, but actually let them see an outcome. So that first outcome was being able to recruit people. I wanted to actually have a stat that I have recruited x amount of people. Therefore, I know how to hire people. I know how to interview them. I know how to onboard them. I know how to create a successful culture because a result shows that. So whether you like me, don't like me, think that it was him, you can't take away the stat. And I became obsessed with not getting things or doing things that took me away from stats.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 对那些可能和20岁的你一样，被不安全感笼罩、缺乏自信、害怕尝试的人，你会说什么？

**娜塔莉：** 全力以赴地投资自己。全力以赴地投入到你感兴趣的那件奇怪的事情上。无论是剪贴簿、社交媒体还是招聘，全身心投入，痴迷于此，并围绕它创造你的环境，让自己客观上成为这个领域的佼佼者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: What would you say to those people from your experience?</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: Go all in on yourself. go all in on that weird thing that you're interested in. If it's scrapbooking, if it's social media, if it's recruiting, if you like reading business books, go allin on that thing. And social media has never created a better time for people to actually create incredible things based off of their own interests and get those things out to the world. So 20-year-old anybody anybody who is 20 years old should say this is what I'm interested in. It is one thing. It is not 12 things. And I'm going to go all in on myself with this thing and become completely obsessed and create my environment around becoming the best at objectively the best at this thing.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 外表重要吗？你曾说应该重塑自己的形象。

**娜塔莉：** 我坚信“成为-行动-拥有”（Be, Do, Have）的过程。你不能在成为那个人之前就“拥有”东西。第一步是“成为”那个人。如果我真的想改变我的外部环境，我需要进入那些圈子，了解那些圈子是什么样的。对我来说，最快的方法，只要不违背我的道德准则，就是开始看起来像、穿着像、行为像我渴望成为的那个样子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: Does it matter how I look? I've I've heard you talk about this in a video you made in April where you're talking about seven steps to transforming yourself and you say that you should rebrand your look. Does it matter how I look?</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: I'm a huge believer in the process of be, do, have. It is not have before you actually be that person and you do the things in order to have the stuff or have the the identity or have the whatever it is that you're looking to create the being a professional golfer, the scrapbooking business, the $20 million organization. And so the first step really is becoming that. And if I really want to change what my external environment is, I need to get in those rooms and I need to start to understand what those rooms look like. And the fastest way for me to actually be able to do that, as long as it doesn't compromise my moral code, would be to start to look like, dress like, act like that thing that I want to become.</p>
</details>

### 高效沟通的秘诀：VCE框架

**主持人：** 你认为沟通有多重要？

**娜塔莉：** 当然，沟通是最重要的事情。为了成功，你必须能够传达你的想法、你的思想、你是谁以及你的观点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: How important do you think communication is in terms of like the way that you show up here and the way that you talk? Do you think that's important?</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: Of course, communication is the most important thing. Next to being successful, actually, I would say in order to be successful, you have to be able to communicate your ideas and your thoughts and who you are and your point of view.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 你从经验中学到了哪些有效的沟通技巧，能让人们认真对待你、倾听你并被你说服？

**娜타莉：** 一个人拥有的沟通框架越多，就越能帮助他们清晰地表达观点。我的框架是“愿景、承诺、执行”（Vision, Commitment, Execution）。我在每一次我真正想要传达并产生影响的沟通中都使用这三个步骤。这个三步框架可以用于争取升职、解雇员工，甚至可以用来和你的伴侣商量今晚去哪里吃饭。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: What are some of the things that you've learned over time that are effective to make people take you seriously to to hear you and to persuade people?</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: The more frameworks somebody has to frame their communication, I think helps them land their point. So there's no shortages of frameworks on the planet. My framework is vision, commitment, execution. I use three steps in every communication that I'm really intentional about and wanting to land. And that three-step framework can be used for getting a promotion. It could be used for laying people off. It could be used to figuring out where you're going to go to dinner that night and persuading your significant other.</p>

**VCE框架**（Vision, Commitment, Execution: 一种沟通框架，依次阐明愿景、承诺和执行计划）的第一步是愿景。愿景之所以重要，是因为如果你能向对方阐明你所沟通内容的意图和“为什么”，你会比直接进入战术层面走得更远。人们会忘记战术，但他们会记住为什么这件事对他们很重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the first step of the framework under VCE is vision. And it's important that vision is first because if you can articulate to somebody the intention and the why behind whatever it is you're communicating, you're going to get much further than just going into tactics. And if it's tactics that you go into, people forget it. People don't remember tactics. They they like the tips, but do they actually implement those things? oftentimes not because it's just tactics. So why is this thing important for the individual?</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 举个例子。我是你的团队成员，你试图说服我开设一个Twitch频道做直播。你会如何运用这个框架？

**娜타莉：** （愿景）Cardone Ventures的使命是帮助企业主实现他们的个人、职业和财务目标。我们的目标是影响一百万企业主，但我们目前只服务了几千人，还有很长的路要走。我研究发现，Twitch可以极大地扩大我们的影响力，将我们的信息传递给这个平台的受众。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: So give me an example. I'm on your team and you're trying to persuade me to launch a Twitch channel to do live streaming. How how would you go through this framework to accomplish that goal?</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: Card Ventures. Our mission is to help business owners achieve their personal, professional, and financial goals. And we're on a path to impact a million business owners. We've only done business with a handful of thousands. We have a long way to go. And one of the things I was researching is Twitch because our impact could be greatly amplified by us having our message be to this audience to this crowd using Twitch vision commitment.</p>
</details>

（承诺）承诺分两部分。第一，我的承诺：我会为你提供最好的培训，帮你建立账户，让你了解这个领域最顶尖的人，并介绍你认识他们，以便你能全面负责这个项目。第二，我要求你的承诺：我希望你非常认真地对待这件事，跟进你将要见到的联系人，确保他们明白你的意图是成为最优秀的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Commitment. There's two steps. First step, what is my commitment? I will provide you whatever training is the best training to get you set up with an account to get you the knowledge and education of people who are crushing it in the space. introduce you to those contacts in order for you to be able to fully launch this and be responsible for it. Commitment part two. What I'd ask for in return is you take that very seriously and with the contacts that you're going to be meeting, you follow up with them. You ensure that they understand that your intention is to be the best of the best, to learn from their mistakes, but to do this in a way that represents our organization at the highest level possible.</p>
</details>

（执行）具体来说，我们会为你开设一个账户。我研究了这个平台，并找到了三位专家，我将投资5000美元让你去向他们学习和接受指导。在接下来的8周内，我们的目标是从零个Twitch订阅者增长到10000个。我们会每天沟通，以消除任何障碍，确保这个项目成功。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Execution. So, what I see this looking like is we're going to get you an account. I've researched this platform. I know nothing about Twitch, but I've researched this platform, and here are the three people that I'm going to invest $5,000 for you to go and learn from, be mentored by, and over the next 8 weeks, the target has to be we're going to go from zero Twitch subscribers to 10,000 Twitch subscribers. and we will check in every single day in order to remove any roadblocks in order for this to be a successful initiative.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 人们通常在哪里会出错？

**娜타莉：** 他们从执行开始。他们会说：“哦，我们需要上Twitch。”然后就把任务扔给团队，自己去做别的事了。他们没有把这件事与“为什么重要”联系起来。我们常常在没有得到对方承诺的情况下就直接进入执行阶段，然后等上几周，才发现事情毫无进展，浪费了时间、动力和热情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: And where do people go wrong here?</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: They start with the execution. They're like, "Oh, we need to be on Twitch." This is what business owners do to their team. They're like, "I came home from this conference. We need to be on Twitch. So, figure out what Twitch is going to look like. Figure out what the plan is. We'll meet back. Talk about it. Just like handle this. I'm super busy. I have to do this thing over here." instead of really tying whatever the thing is that you're asking somebody to why is this important? ... But so often we drop right into execution without first getting the commitment from the other person that they're even interested. And then we wait 4 weeks or 8 weeks or 12 weeks thinking something is happening when it is not happening. and we lose time, momentum, excitement, enthusiasm about growing and our confidence in people that we can actually trust them goes down.</p>
</details>

### 时间管理与努力工作的真正含义

**主持人：** 你也谈到掌控你的日历是转变的核心。为什么这如此重要？

**娜塔莉：** 如果你想在生活中得到任何东西，你实际上必须花时间去争取。你的日历反映并代表了你认为重要的事情，它与你每天的目标是否一致。如果我的日历上没有任何时间花在为公司创造收入上，那么年底时我的收入和去年一样，我也不应该感到惊讶。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: You talk about mastering your calendar as well being central to transformation. Why is why is this so important and what does that mean?</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: Well, if you want anything in life, you actually have to spend time to get that thing. things don't just magically manifest into people's lives despite what the internet tells you. So, in order for me to have the relationship that I want to have, I actually have to invest time with my significant other. ... And so your calendar is a reflection and a representation of what you find to be important and is in alignment or out of alignment with the goals that you have every single day. So if I have zero time being spent on generating revenue inside my business, it shouldn't surprise me at the end of the year that I'm doing the same amount of revenue that I did last year. Why? I spent zero time on the one thing aka revenue generation in order for it to grow.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 在这个等式中，努力工作呢？

**娜塔莉：** 努力工作是最重要的事。如果你想去的地方确实不寻常或超凡脱俗，不努力工作是到不了的。你可以尝试走捷径，但那些人内心充满了恐惧和焦虑，因为他们不知道自己的位置，他们没有做必要的事情来获得他们拥有的东西。当你通过正确的顺序（成为-行动-拥有）得到你想要的东西时，你就不会有那种焦虑，不会担心一切都会崩溃，因为你知道你可以重来一次。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: What about hard work in this equation?</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: Working hard is the most important thing. You cannot get to where you want to go if it's truly something that is unusual or out of the ordinary without working hard. And you could try to hack it. ... I've met those people and those people have crippling fear and anxiety because they don't actually know what their place is and they don't know they didn't do what was required to have the thing. So going back to like be do have ... And when you are able in life to have things that you want because you did it in the right order, you don't have this anxiousness, you don't have this anxiety, you don't have this worry or fear that someone's going to take it from you. It's all going to come crashing down because you know that you could redo it.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 你工作有多努力？

**娜塔莉：** 我从不停止工作。我生活中的每一件事都为我所做的工作进行了优化。因为我做的工作对我很重要。我处在人生的一个阶段，我坚信我正在做的工作可以改变我的生活，也可以改变别人的生活。所以，如果我不花每一分钟去思考我能做些什么来推动我热衷的工作，那将是自私的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: So, how hard do you work? If we look at an average week, why are you smiling?</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: I'm never not working. So, however many hours are in a day, everything in my life is optimized to the work that I do. Every single thing. Because the work that I do is important to me. And I'm in a phase of my life where I really do believe that the work that I'm doing can change my life. It can change others lives. So, it would be selfish of me to not spend every minute thinking about what I can do in order to help move the work that I do that I'm passionate about.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 那么职业倦怠呢？

**娜塔莉：** 努力工作并不会导致倦怠，这是一个误解。我认识的成功人士中，没有一个会因为漫长的一天而感到倦怠。我的商业伙伴格兰特·卡东说：“你不是蜡烛，你不会燃尽。”人类是不会燃尽的。你可能会感到压力，但这并不是坏事。这说明你肩负责任，有人依赖你。只有当你看不到你所做的牺牲能带你走向目标时，你才会感到倦怠。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: Burnout then in your view, why do people say, do you know, I was doing this thing and I got burnt out so I had what is that?</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: and never burnoutinducing though and I think that that's a misconception about hard work. I don't know successful people who are still in the game who are burnt out by a long day. ... My business partner Grant Cardone who I am obsessed with and that was one of the greatest partnerships I could have ever done in my entire life. He says, "You're not a candle. You can't burn out. A human being cannot burn out because you are not a candle. So, can you feel moments of pressure, stress? Yes. I don't take any of those moments as being a bad thing. ... and you only really get burnt out if you don't see how the sacrifices that you're making are actually going to lead you to the six-pack.</p>
</details>

### 成功与幸福：一场零和游戏？

**主持人：** 成功和幸福，哪个更重要？

**娜塔莉：** 它们是同一件事，并非对立。当我创造事物，当我在物质世界中看到我完成了我想做的事情时，我就是最快乐的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: What matters more being in your view being happy and content with your life or being successful even if it comes at the cost of contentment?</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: They are the same thing. They're not different. I do not find success and happiness uh on two polar opposites. I am happy when I create things and when I can see in the physical universe that I've done something that I wanted to do whether that's driving revenue, hiring people, helping a business owner, that is when I I am the happiest when I am doing the things that are part of becoming successful.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 如果那个刷Netflix的莎拉感到满足和快乐呢？

**娜塔莉：** 她并不满足或快乐。因为她看的是什么？是《日落家园》，看着别人过着她梦寐以求的生活。如果她真的相信自己也能拥有那些，她会选择去争取，而不是旁观。我认为那是一种伪装成快乐的深度不安全感和不满足。我们经济的现实和她的财务状况为莎拉创造了依赖性。而我发现，你所依赖的东西，在某种程度上，你最终会怨恨它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: So if Sarah who's scrolling on Netflix is is content and happy,</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: she's not content or happy though.</p>
<p class="english-text">Host: How do you know?</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: Because what is she watching? Is she watching Selling Sunset and watching other people live their lives and touring these gorgeous homes and having these fancy things that Sarah would would love to have? If she really thought she could have those things, if she really actually believed that for a second and these are the steps that are part of getting there, I do believe that she would choose actually having it versus watching it. ... I think that there is a deep sense of insecurity and lack of contentment that's guised as I'm happy and that's guised as or covered of it's almost like a a facade. I'm going to say that I'm happy. But the realities of our economy and the realities of her financial situation create dependencies for Sarah. It creates dependencies and with those dependencies what I found is that the things that you are dependent upon at some level you will end up resenting.</p>
</details>

### 赢得尊重的两大支柱

**主持人：** 如果有人总是感觉不被尊重，他们应该怎么做才能赢得尊重？

**娜塔莉：** 要想赢得尊重，首先必须决定，你宁愿被尊重，也不愿被喜欢。我们常常为了被喜欢而放弃了做正确且能赢得尊重的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: What would you say they should do to to earn people's respect?</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: The first thing somebody has to do in order to earn respect is to decide that they would rather be respected than liked. That trade-off is made too often. We're in a situation when the right respectful thing to do is unlikable. We don't choose the right respectable thing to do. We prioritize being liked.</p>
</details>

其次，你必须在你想要获得尊重的领域里拿出“数据”。什么是你专业领域里不容否认的证据？它存在于物质世界中，是事实。你不能只是有个想法或认为自己能成为企业家。例如，如果你想给别人提供关系建议，但你自己却没有一段成功的关系，那你就不应该给出建议，这也是你在那个领域得不到尊重的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so when you make that decision to be respected and to not prioritize what everybody thinks about you, you can then transition into the second step which is you have to get stats in the area that you want respect in. ... What is the area of your expertise that is undeniable? It's proof. It exists in the physical universe. It's not just because you had an idea or you think you can be an entrepreneur or you'd like to be someone who gives people relationship advice. I'm sorry, but if you're not in a relationship and you don't have a stat of being able to have a good relationship and you can't have a spouse that's like, "Wow, this person's great. I love being around this person." You probably shouldn't be giving that advice. And that's why you don't have respect in that area.</p>
</details>

### 2025创业指南：抓住AI与服务业机遇

**主持人：** 如果我想在2025年创业，根据你看到的成败案例，你会给人们什么建议？

**娜塔莉：** 如果任何潜在的创业者能从“我在哪里最有可能成功”这个角度来思考创业，那将是最好的框架。不幸的是，大多数人并非如此，他们基于自己已有的经验和技能。我认为人工智能将是伟大的平衡器，因为没有多少人在人工智能领域有丰富的经验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: If I'm thinking of starting a business in 2025, you know, you've spoken to thousands and thousands and thousands of business owners online, probably many millions of business owners. When we think about that initial period of like coming up with the idea and picking what to work on. Is there any advice you would give people based on the success and failure you've seen about what they should aim at, what they should work on, especially in the context of like 2025 when so much in the world is changing so quickly?</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: If they could use the frame, if any business owner or potential business owner could think about starting a business from the standpoint of where is there the greatest chance for me to be successful, that is the best frame to use. Unfortunately, most do not use that frame and they base it off of their existing experience and the skills that they have. If it was not based off of existing experience or skills that somebody has, I think great AI is going to be the great leveler because nobody has a lot of experience in AI.</p>
</details>

如果我在2025年创业，我绝对会关注如何帮助那些对有效工具预算无限的企业主解决他们面临的实际问题。美国3500万企业主面临的实际问题是，他们不知道如何使用AI，他们对AI感到恐惧。在接下来的18到24个月里，真正解决这些问题的人可以建立一个八位数甚至九位数的企业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so if I was starting a business in 2025, I would absolutely look at how do I help business owners who have an infinite budget for things that actually work to make them more money solve problems that are real to them. And the problems that are real to the 35 million business owners in the United States of America is that they don't know how to use AI. they are terrified of AI and they're going to either put their head in the sand or assume that somebody who is young is going to create the solution for them when somebody instead who is experienced could have a eight maybe even a nine figure business over the course of the next 18 to 24 months really figuring out how to help solve these problems because it makes the business owner to that business incredibly sticky.</p>
</details>

我也对服务型企业非常看好，比如屋顶工、水管工、电工、暖通空调。这些业务的核心在机器人普及之前不会被AI颠覆。但它们的运营流程已经成熟，可以由任何人——无论是15岁还是50岁——介入，通过实施非常简单的AI解决方案来为这些企业解决问题，并获得每个客户数万美元的报酬。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I'm also very excited about service-based businesses, roofers, plumbers, electricians, HVAC, all of those businesses. The core of the business doesn't get disrupted by AI until robots. But those business operations are ripe for somebody to come in, I don't care if you're 15 years old or if you're 50 years old, and get paid tens of thousands of dollars per client to implement very simple solutions that really do solve problems for those businesses using AI.</p>
</details>

### 突破瓶颈：企业如何从百万走向千万

**主持人：** 很多小企业主，尤其是服务型企业，在年收入达到百万左右时会遇到瓶颈，不知道如何超越自己进行扩张。你会对他们说什么？

**娜塔莉：** 欢迎来到创业世界。这不是独特的挑战，而是预料之中的挑战。统计数据显示，企业主在将行之有效的业务模式转变为由他人协助的模式时，都会面临这些挑战。问题在于，他们技术上不知道如何培训别人做好他们擅长的事情，从而让自己能专注于企业主的首要角色——创造收入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: so many small business owners will come up to me and say that they are they won't say it like this but what they're describing is that they're a bottleneck in their own business. They're at maybe I don't know a million in revenue. ... what would you what do you say to those people when you've encountered them in your your company?</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: Welcome to being an entrepreneur. This is not a unique set of challenges. This is an expected set of challenges. The statistics show that the challenges that business owners face at that break point of taking what they are doing that is working and transitioning that to having other people help them is part of the process. And so there is nothing wrong with this business owner. It's just that they don't technically know how to train somebody to do what they do well that then allows the business owner to focus on the business owner's primary role. And that primary role should be to generate revenue.</p>
</details>

核心技能是战术性的。打开你的日历，看看你每天做什么，通过创建流程来复制你所做的事情。每个企业主都认为自己是唯一能与客户交谈的人。他们必须客观地审视自己时间的分配，并找出那些并非最高价值、可以培训他人来做的具体任务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what is that skill? What is the core skill there? It's a tactical skill. And the skill is opening up their calendar, looking at what they do every single day, duplicating through process creation what it is that they do that makes them a special snowflake in their mind. Because every business owner thinks that they are the only person that can talk to their customer. ... they create those conditions instead of saying, "No, I'm going to objectively look at where I spend my time, and out of all of the things that I do across a 50-hour work week, there are specific things that are not the highest value for me to continue to do, but I would have to train somebody how to do that thing flawlessly."</p>
</details>

我喜欢称之为“4M模型”：建模（Model）、模仿（Mimic）、精通（Master）、倍增（Multiply）。首先，企业主为当前产生收入的业务**建模**。然后，让新员工**模仿**这个行为，直到他们能够**精通**。一旦有人精通了某项业务，他们就可以开始调整和增加新的东西。当团队成员完成了前三个M，他们就处于可以**倍增**自己角色的位置了，比如在自己下面增加一个协调员。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I like to call this the four M. Model, mimic, master, multiply. The business owner can first create the model of what they are doing today that's generating the $800,000 of revenue in their plumbing business. I take a model. I have the model. This is what we are doing for email marketing inside our business. Then I move into seeing if they can mimic what is the behavior to then move into mastering it. And once somebody is at mastering something inside a plumbing business for $800,000 a year that it's generating, they can then start to tweak and add things and and maybe we're going to also try one other thing. ... At which point when a team member can go through those first three M's, model, mimic, master, then they're in a position to multiply their role.</p>

### 财富的未来：女性财富转移与金融素养

**主持人：** 你之前提到了“女性财富转移”，能解释一下这是什么吗？

**娜塔莉：** 女性财富转移指的是，在2025年到2030年间，女性手中的财富将从目前的10万亿美元增长到30万亿美元。这种财富转移的发生，不仅仅是因为女性赚了更多的钱，还因为男女预期寿命的差异。男性平均比女性早逝大约五到六年，因此女性会继承资产，如房屋、企业、投资组合，而她们往往被排除在与财务顾问的对话之外，不知道如何管理这些资产。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: Earlier on, you mentioned um this this phrase which I've not heard before and it was just before we started recording you talked about a woman's wealth transfer. ... What is this?</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: The women's wealth transfer. between 2025 and 2030 looks like just these are US stats 10 trillion dollars are in the hands of women right now and between now and 2030 that number is going to go up to $30 trillion. So this wealth is going to balloon. And when you think about the implications of how this wealth transfer happens, it's not just cash that is given to women all of the sudden because they're making more money. There's a transition because of differences in life expectancy in partners. A man and a woman, there's about a on average men are going to die first. Yep. And it's about five and a half, six years. So women are left with assets, not cash, like homes, businesses, portfolios, investments, bank accounts that often times they were left out of the conversation with the financial adviser. And they don't actually know how to operationalize, how to manage</p>
</details>

然而，今天，由于内容创作的原因，女性在财务上感觉能力更差。Elvest公司最近的一项研究分析了女性创作者在互联网上创作的“吸引力法则”内容，发现其数量是投资和股权内容的12倍。70%的女性在消费了这些金融信息后感到更加不知所措，因为它分享的是技巧或窍门，而不是一个真正的系统和流程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But women today feel less financially able due to content creation. There was recent study done by a company called Elvest where they analyze the amount of manifestation content on the internet created by women creators. There's 12 times as much manifestation content from women creators as there is investing and equity content. Or 70% of women feel more overwhelmed with financial information after consuming the content because it's a tip or trick or hack that is being shared instead of a real system and process</p>
</details>

### AI时代的终极技能

**主持人：** 考虑到人工智能和机器人技术正在迅速取代许多传统技能，你认为未来的优势是什么？我应该加倍投入学习哪项技能，是机器人和AI无法从我这里夺走的？

**娜塔莉：** 我认为，在人工智能的世界里，我们唯一能真正加倍投入的技能是学习和适应的能力。我们无法预测2040年的世界会是什么样子。我们不知道机器人能做什么或不能做什么。唯一能对冲风险的就是适应和学习的能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: What is the edge of the future in your view? What is the edge? What is the skill I should double down on that the robots and AI aren't going to steal from me?</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: I think the only skill that we can actually double down on in a world of AI is the skill of learning and adapting because we cannot predict what the world is going to look like in 2040. We do not know what robots are or aren't going to be capable of. ... And so the only hedge that somebody can have is the ability to adapt and learn.</p>
</details>

每个人都应该利用AI来提升学习能力。承认你所不知道的，这是一个人最大的优势。坦然地说：“我不知道如何阅读损益表。我不知道这份法律合同。我对AI一无所知。”然后说服自己，这是你必须突破学习新事物障碍的最重要技能。这会让你感到不舒服，但要坚持下去，适应并学习，这样你才能具体地建立信心，相信自己可以在任何环境中根据需要做出改变并增加价值。这是唯一的选择，没有替代方案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what AI should be used for with every individual is the ability to learn. Acknowledge what you don't know. That is the greatest strength somebody has. Really be comfortable saying, "I do not know how to read a P&L. I don't know how to read this legal contract. I don't know anything about AI and what I've heard LLM. Uh I don't really know what it is or agentic. What's the difference?" And be able to convince yourself why that is the most important skill for you to push past that barrier of learning something new. That is so uncomfortable because the the names are new and you feel like a freaking idiot and then you think everybody is smarter than you and that you're just some fraud. To push back on that and to have some resilience through it to say, I'm going to adapt through this. I'm going to get to the other side and learn so that I concretely can have confidence that I can change in any environment based off of what's needed of me in that environment and I will add value to that environment regardless of whatever the external circumstances are. That is the only choice. There is no alternative choice.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 你对AI感到害怕吗？

**娜타莉：** 一点也不害怕。我非常兴奋。因为我曾经觉得自己很笨，觉得那些聪明人知道一些我不知道的事情。几年前，当AI推出时，我的人生观彻底改变了。AI在两年内教会我的东西，是我可能需要上学多年才能学到的。对于像我这样的人来说，这是一个前所未有的时代，可以利用这个信息源，专门辅导你所不知道的东西，真正地装备你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Host: Are you scared about AI?</p>
<p class="english-text">Natalie: I'm not scared at all. I'm pumped. As you can tell, I'm really excited because I used to feel dumb. I used to feel like there were things that these smart people knew that I didn't know. And my entire outlook on life changed a handful of years ago when this got launched because AI has taught me in two years what I would have had to go to school for and would have had to get a degree in still to just find out that most people who went to school for those things and had degrees in them missed something critical and important. And so for me, and I think people like me, and I don't think there's anything particularly special about who I categorize as people like me, it is a unprecedented time to lean into this reference of information that can specifically tutor you on what you don't know, to actually equip you.</p>
</details>
