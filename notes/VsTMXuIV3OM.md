### 导言：顶尖1%人群的财富策略
**主持人：** 对于刚刚点开这段对话的观众，你认为他们留下来倾听我们今天要谈论的内容，以及你整个职业生涯所理解的一切，为什么是重要的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Natalie. For my viewers that have just clicked on this conversation, what is the reason that you think it's important for them to stay and listen to what we're going to talk about today? and all of the things that you've spent your career understanding.</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 如果你是一个付出了辛勤努力、精力和能量，却没有相应财富可展示的人，那么这次对话很重要。因为财富应该来自于在正确的问题上付出的努力。所以你必须问自己一个问题：我每天都在解决什么问题？无论你是组织中的团队成员、领导者，还是企业主，你都应该能够客观地指出“我在这里的工作产生了这个结果”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you are somebody who has really struggled with working hard and putting in the effort and the energy, but you don't actually have wealth to show for it. This conversation is important because wealth should come from hard work on the right set of problems. And so you have to ask yourself the question, what problems do I work on every single day? And whether you're a team member in an organization, whether you're a leader in an organization, a business owner in an organization, you should be able to objectively point at my work here generated this result.</p>
</details>

所以，如果我对这个结果不满意，意味着我没有创造出我想要的财富和收入，那么很可能你花费时间和精力解决的问题，与你增加财富的实际目标没有关联。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so if I'm upset with this result, meaning I haven't made the wealth, I haven't created the income that I want, it would make sense that where you're spending your time and the problems that you're solving are not tied to your actual goal of increasing your wealth.</p>
</details>

谈到财富，我认为我们正处于全球性的财富危机中。关于金融素养，以及谁在赚钱、他们如何赚钱、他们把时间花在什么地方，存在太多的困惑和误解。因此，我非常期待在这次对话中，揭示那些顶尖1%的人在时间、投资、技能和心态方面所使用的策略，这些策略与那99%似乎无法取得进展、创造理想财富的人截然不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when it comes to wealth, I do think that we are in a wealth crisis across the globe. I think that there is so much confusion and misunderstanding about financial literacy and what's actually happening with who is making money, how they're making money, what they're spending their time on. And so this conversation I'm very much looking forward to unpacking what are the strategies that people use the 1% for their time, for their investments, for their skills, for their mindset that are just different than 99% of people who can't seem to get ahead and create the wealth that they've always wanted.</p>
</details>

### 商业成功的基石：人的品格
**主持人：** 那么，你现在坐在这里，你的业务是什么？规模有多大？它做什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so as you sit here now, what is your business? What's the scale of the business? And uh what does it do?</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 在过去的六年里，我联合创办了两家公司，如今都达到了九位数（亿美元）的规模。一家是名为 Cardone Ventures 的管理咨询投资公司，我们帮助小企业主成长和扩大他们的组织。我每天都与那些年收入300万美元、想知道如何成为少数能拥有500万或1000万美元年收入的企业主合作，因为他们真正意识到，每年300万美元并不能带来真正的财务安全。这家公司成立于2019年。我们的第二家公司是 10X Health，我们在2023年收购了一家健康企业，如今它正在帮助世界各地的人们，并且也是一家九位数的企业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, over the last six years, I co-founded two businesses that are both nine figures today. One is a management consulting investment firm. It's called Cardone Ventures, and we help small business owners grow and scale their organizations. So, I work with business owners on a daily basis who will be doing $3 million in annual revenue. They want to know, how do I become one of the fewer that is able to have a $5 million a year business or a $10 million a year business? because they really realized that $3 million a year doesn't actually create financial security. And that business was started in 2019. And then our second business, 10X Health, we purchased a health business back in 2023 and today is helping people all over the world and it's a nine figure business.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 在你的第一家公司，你和多少位企业主合作过？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you're on that first business. How many business owners have you worked with?</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 参与过我们项目的企业主总数超过15,000人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Total business owners that have come through our programs would be over 15,000.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 你在哪些方面帮助他们？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what what are the range of things you're helping them with?</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 好问题。我们提供教育、咨询、服务和投资。你可以把我们想象成面向小企业的“麦肯锡”。我们逆向分析他们当前的市场、业务、产品、服务和 offerings，然后以实际服务的形式回馈给他们，比如我们会为他们做市场营销、招聘人员、处理簿记。但我们业务中也有一个庞大的活动部分，我们培训企业主如何自己招聘，这样他们就不需要雇佣我们来做。我其实更喜欢人们不雇我们来做这些，因为我认为企业主和团队内部的领导者掌握这项能力非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Great question. So, there's education. Yeah. There's consulting, there's services, and there's investing. So, think of us like the McKenzie for small businesses. We reverse engineer their current market, what they're doing, what their products, services, offerings are, and we give back to them either in the form of actual services where we will do their marketing for them, we will recruit people for them, we will do their bookkeeping for them. But then we also have a massive events component of our business where we train business owners on how to hire, how to recruit themselves. So they don't need to hire us to do it. I actually prefer it when people don't hire us to do this because I think it's so important for business owners and the leaders inside those teams to actually get the competence in that skill.</p>
</details>

如果企业主不懂得如何阅读**P&L**（Profit and Loss Statement: 损益表，显示公司在特定时期内的收入、成本和费用）和**资产负债表**（Balance Sheet: 反映公司在特定时间点的财务状况）的重要性，他们总是会把这项工作推给别人。在某个时刻，这将不再奏效，因为他们自己并不真正了解这项技能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If if business owners don't understand how to read a P&L and the importance of a balance sheet, they're always going to abdicate that work to somebody else. And at some point, that is not going to work for them any longer because I don't actually know what that skill is.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 回到2019年，你现在所知道的商业成功基本原则，和那时相比，最根本的区别是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if I jumped back to 2019, what is the difference like fundamental difference in the principles of how to be successful in business that you know now that you wouldn't have known then? Like what are the glaring principles?</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 我最终认为，这归结于做生意的人的品格。因为即使是世界上最好的商业模式，你搞定了营销、运营，可以规模化，但如果这个人是个混蛋，不道德，不合规，没有求胜心，那就不行。对我来说，这三者是相辅相成的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I ultimately think that this comes down to the character of the person that is doing the business. Even if it's the best business model in the world, you figured out marketing, you figured out operations, you can scale it. If the person is a piece of [ __ ] and if the person is not somebody who is ethical and is somebody who's compliant and isn't somebody who wants to win, to me those three things go hand in hand.</p>
</details>

商业模式是什么并不重要。你可以给我一个屋顶公司、一个**HVAC**（Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning: 供暖、通风和空调系统）公司、一个健康公司或一个营销机构。我过去认为正确的许多原则，在过去六年里依然适用，比如会计的标准做法、如何招聘人才。但过去六年我痛苦地学到的是，一切都关乎与你合作的人、你选择的伙伴以及你允许进入核心圈子的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because it to me it doesn't matter what the business model is. You could give me a roofing business, you can give me an HVAC business, you can give me a wellness company, a marketing agency. The principles that I thought to be true, many of them have held true over the last six years since 2019. But what I've learned painfully over the last 6 years is everything is about the people that you do business with and the partners that you choose and the people that you allow in your inner circle.</p>
</details>

这不仅适用于你自己的企业，也适用于我们帮助的企业。我可以看着最优秀的创业者走进我们的组织，她渴望成功，对未来充满期待，会认真做笔记并回家实施。但如果她的生活中有某个拖后腿的人——可能是配偶、孩子，更糟的是她花钱雇来帮忙的员工——那就不行了。这就是讽刺之处：你花钱请人帮忙，但当他们真正加入你的团队时，他们所做的事情却会削弱你实现目标和发挥潜力的能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so that is the case for your own business, but that's also the case for the businesses that we help. And I can watch the most incredible business owner come into our organization. She's wanting to win. She's excited about what the future can look like. She's going to take all of the notes and actually go home and implement those things. But if she has somebody in her life, say it's a spouse, say it's a kid, worse yet it's an employee that she's paying to help her. Like that's the irony. You pay people to help you and yet when they're actually on your team, they do things that detract from your ability to achieve your goals and to reach your potential.</p>
</details>

到那时我发现，商业模式是什么都无关紧要了。你可以把所有的书、所有的培训、完整的行动手册都给某个人，他们还是会失败。因为要么他们自己不是那种人，要么他们在业务中被那些只会成为他们障碍的人包围，这些人会持续阻碍他们成长和追求更高目标的能力，从而削弱这个人的自信，导致他们的业务停滞不前。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's where I find doesn't matter what the business model is, doesn't matter. You can give all of the books, all of the training, the full playbook to somebody, they're going to fail because either they aren't that person or they've surrounded themselves inside their business with people who will just be stops to them and continually stop their ability to grow and to reach for more, reducing that person's confidence in themselves and their business stays stuck.</p>
</details>

### 如何招聘A级玩家：三步面试法
**主持人：** 如果人是长期成功的关键，那么你在人身上寻找什么特质？你如何筛选出他们？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If people are the most important thing for long-term success and for business, what are you looking for in people? What makes someone an A player in your view? And how do you how do you filter them out?</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 我使用一个三步面试流程。第一步是文化面试。比起了解他们是否能胜任工作的技术细节，我更想知道他们是否与我们的组织价值观一致，是否以目标为导向。在雇佣某人之前，你能问的最好的问题是：他们未来五年的目标是什么？并且要得到一个真实的答案。我不太关心你有什么技能和经验，如果你没有目标，我不会雇佣你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I use a three-step interview process. So the three steps for me is a first a cultural interview. I want to understand more so than me trying to get into the technicalities of can they do the work. Are they aligned with our organization? Are they goal oriented? The best question that you can ask somebody inside a business before you hire them, what are their five-year goals and actually get a real answer. I don't really care what skills and experiences you have. If you don't have goals, you're I'm not hiring you.</p>
</details>

然后我直接进入技术面试，我希望让这个人尽可能接近实际工作。如果你要成为一名销售人员，我想看你打一通销售电话。如果你是我们的平面设计师，我会让你在我面前实际制作一个演示文稿或广告图。如果他们需要两天时间来思考，或者不知道如何使用 Adobe 或 Canva，我就不能雇佣他们，因为我知道他们不具备那种技能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then I move straight into a technical interview where I want to get the person as close to the work as possible. So if you're going to be a salesperson, I want to see you make a a sales call. If you are a graphic designer in our organization, we do not do briefs. For us, we are turnurning content constantly because that's the world that we live in for the amount of ads that need to be created, presentation decks. It can't take a bunch of time. And so if the person when I do a case study interview and I have them actually make a presentation in front of me says that they need two days to think about this and they can't assemble some form of a presentation or a graphic for an ad. They don't know how to use Adobe or Canva or whatever the platform is, I I can't really hire the person because I know that they don't have that skill.</p>
</details>

最后一步是核心价值观面试。对我来说，团队成员在加入组织前，能够展示他们真正理解并认同我们的核心价值观是至关重要的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the final one is a core values interview. And for me, our team's ability to demonstrate ahead of time, ahead of joining the organization that they actually understand and are in alignment with our core values is essential.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 你如何测试一个人的核心价值观？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you test someone's core values?</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 我会让他们举例说明他们过去是如何体现我们公司核心价值观的，并向我们的领导团队进行陈述。在 Cardone Ventures 的前100名团队成员中，我听取了每一次核心价值观的陈述。如果一个人不能展示并具体说出，“我能够产生X数量的潜在客户并以Y的转化率转化他们”，他们可能对自己所说的一无所知，并且在这个环境中会非常艰难。我相信这是企业主的责任。你必须掌控你的文化和环境。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I asked them to give me times where they have exemplified the core values that we have and they present it to our leadership team. For the first 100 team members at Cardone Ventures, I listen to every single core values presentation. the person can't demonstrate and actually say, "Oh, I was able to generate x amount of leads and convert them at y percentage." They probably don't know what they're talking about and they're gonna have a really hard time in the environment. And I do believe that this is the business owner's responsibility. You have to own your culture and your environment.</p>
</details>

### PPF框架：清晰化你的人生目标
**主持人：** 你提到目标设定是识人的关键。你的目标设定框架是什么？如果有人对自己的目标不清楚，他们应该怎么做？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You talked about goal setting being an imperative when you're meeting people. What is what is your framework for goal setting? If someone at home isn't quite clear on their goals, what what should they be doing?</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 我有一个三步法用于目标设定，我已经向成千上万的人推广过。这个三步框架真正改变了我的生活，因为它让我能够为目标创建分类。这个过程被称为**PPF框架**（Personal, Professional, Financial: 个人、职业和财务目标设定框架）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have a three-step methodology for goal setting that I have rolled out to thousands of people. And this three-step framework has really transformed my life because it allows me to create buckets for goals. And the process is called personal goals, professional goals, and financial goals.</p>
</details>

在与团队成员和企业主就他们的目标进行了一千多次个人对话后，我可以说，我从未发现任何一个目标超出这三个范畴。但许多人遇到的挑战是，在除夕夜，他们开始列出所有他们想完成的美好事情和想成为的人，这变成了一场非常深奥的对话。他们没有真正优先考虑：个人层面，成功是什么样的？职业层面，成功是什么样的？财务层面，成功是什么样的？以及一年后、三年后、五年后这些目标会是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And after having over a thousand of these conversations personally where I've interviewed team members and business owners and team members of business owners about their goals, what I can say is I've never found a goal that is outside of those three buckets. But the challenge many people run into is on New Year's Eve, they start to list out all of the lovely things that they would like to accomplish and who they want to be. And it becomes this very esoteric conversation. Instead of really prioritizing personally, what does success look like? Professionally, what does success look like? Financially, what does success look like? And what would those targets be in one year from now, 3 years from now, and 5 years from now?</p>
</details>

因为这三个类别在短期内很容易思考。一年对大多数人来说非常直接。三年后就开始变得有点模糊了。而五年后，对大多数人来说，他们很难去思考。但唯一不变的是，五年后，我们都会老五岁。我今天32岁，五年后，我肯定会是37岁。那么，37岁的娜塔莉是谁？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because those three buckets become easy to think about in the short term. One year for most people, super straightforward. Three years starts to get a little bit more nebulous. And after having over a thousand of these conversations, 5 years for most people they have a hard time thinking with. But the one constant is in 5 years from now, guess what? We're going to be 5 years older. I am 32 years old today. In 5 years from now, for certain, I will be 37 years old. And so, who is Natalie at 37?</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 她是谁？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Who is she?</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 她是个厉害角色。娜塔莉掌控着她的环境。娜塔莉能够做出很多我今天在财务上还无法做出的投资，因为我想能够仅仅因为我能做到，就给慈善机构写一张一百万美元的支票。理想情况下，我希望那张支票是一千万或五千万美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">She's a [ __ ] badass. Natalie is in control of her environment. Natalie is able to make a lot of financial investments that I'm not in the position financially to make today because I want to be able to write a million dollar check to charity just because I can. I'd ideally like that check to be 10 or $50 million.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 我应该如何具体地写下这些目标？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">is there any specific way that I should write this down? Is it just do I just think about in 5 years from now, what are my personal, professional, and financial goals? And then I write that down on a piece of paper, for example.</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 好问题。理想情况下，个人目标在最上面，下面分为一年、三年和五年的格子。接下来是职业目标，同样分一年、三年、五年。最后是财务目标，也是一年、三年、五年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Great question. Ideally, personal is at the top, with a bucket for one year, three year, and fiveyear. Then the next is professional, one year, three year, 5 year. Financial one year, three year, five year.</p>
</details>

### 建立自信：从创造“数据”开始
**主持人：** 你用“厉害角色”这个词。这种心态是怎样的？你一直都是这样吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know, you use the word badass. What is the mindset of a badass? Like, have you always been like this?</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 我一直想成为这样，但今天我就是这样。20岁时，我因别人对我的看法而充满焦虑和恐惧。我害怕如果我成功了，未来会受到怎样的评判。因为我内心有一部分在想，万一我只是因为嫁给了一个成功的人才成功的呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I always wanted this, but today I am this. At 20 years old, I was crippled with anxiety and fear about what others thought of me, about this decision that I made to be in a relationship with somebody who was older than me, and thinking that for the rest of my life, somebody was going to think that, oh, she just married her way to the top. She slept her way to success. She's not actually very smart. She's just a gold digger and she took the easy way out. And so 20-year-old me was actually terrified of being in front of people, was terrified of the future judgment that would come if I was successful. Because I think there was a part of me that thought to myself, well, what if I am only successful because I married somebody who is successful?</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 是什么改变了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What changed? What happened? How did you acquire such an aura?</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 这种气场来自于有目标地去获取我可以证明的“数据”（stats），这些数据能让别人看到的不是我个人和我的生活选择，而是一个实际的结果。第一个结果是能够招聘人才。我想要一个具体的数据，证明我招聘了X数量的人。因此，我知道如何招聘、面试、入职，以及如何创造一个成功的文化，因为结果证明了这一点。所以，无论你喜欢我还是不喜欢我，认为这是靠他还是靠我，你都无法抹去这个数据。我变得痴迷于不做任何会让我远离数据的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the aura came from targeting, getting stats that I could prove that let somebody not see me and my life choices, but actually let them see an outcome. So that first outcome was being able to recruit people. I wanted to actually have a stat that I have recruited x amount of people. Therefore, I know how to hire people. I know how to interview them. I know how to onboard them. I know how to create a successful culture because a result shows that. So whether you like me, don't like me, think that it was him, you can't take away the stat. And I became obsessed with not getting things or doing things that took me away from stats.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 所以你需要为自己获取关于自己的第一手证据。这样你内心就知道自己是谁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you needed to acquire first party evidence for yourself about yourself. So that within yourself, you knew who you were that you had a a self case for who you are.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 对于那些可能像20岁的你一样，被不安全感笼罩、缺乏自信、害怕尝试的人，你会对他们说什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">for people to do that cuz I'm sure there's so many people listening that are maybe 20-year-old Natalie in some way, maybe a bit shrouded with sort certain insecurities and maybe aren't the most conf confident, maybe a bit anxious, scared about what people might think if they try. What would you say to those people from your experience?</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 全力以赴地投入到自己身上。全力以赴地投入到你感兴趣的那件奇怪的事情上。无论是剪贴簿、社交媒体还是招聘，如果你喜欢读商业书籍，就全身心投入。社交媒体为人们创造了前所未有的好时机，可以基于自己的兴趣创造出不可思议的东西，并将其推向世界。所以任何20岁的人都应该说：“这是我感兴趣的一件事，不是十二件事。”然后我要在这件事上全力以赴，变得完全痴迷，并围绕它创造我的环境，成为客观上这件事的最强者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Go all in on yourself. go all in on that weird thing that you're interested in. If it's scrapbooking, if it's social media, if it's recruiting, if you like reading business books, go allin on that thing. And social media has never created a a better time for people to actually create incredible things based off of their own interests and get those things out to the world. So 20-year-old anybody anybody who is 20 years old should say this is what I'm interested in. It is one thing. It is not 12 things. And I'm going to go all in on myself with this thing and become completely obsessed and create my environment around becoming the best at objectively the best at this thing.</p>
</details>

### “成为-行动-拥有”原则
**主持人：** 外表重要吗？你曾在一个视频里说应该重塑自己的形象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Does it matter how you look? I've I've heard you talk about this in a video you made in April where you're talking about seven steps to transforming yourself and you say that you should rebrand your look. Does it matter how I look?</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 我认为外表对人们来说很重要。但如果你想重塑自己，拥有新的身份，我坚信“成为-行动-拥有”（be, do, have）的过程。你不能在真正成为那个人、做那些事之前就想“拥有”那些东西或身份。所以第一步是“成为”那个人。如果我真的想改变我的外部环境，我需要进入那些圈子，并开始了解那些圈子是什么样的。对我来说，最快的方法，只要不违背我的道德准则，就是开始看起来像、穿着像、行为像我渴望成为的那样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it matters a lot to people how they look. But if you want to rebrand yourself and have this new identity, I'm a huge believer in the process of be, do, have. It is not have before you actually be that person and you do the things in order to have the stuff or have the identity or have the whatever it is that you're looking to create the being a professional golfer, the scrapbooking business, the $20 million organization. And so the first step really is becoming that. And if I really want to change what my external environment is, I need to get in those rooms and I need to start to understand what those rooms look like. And the fastest way for me to actually be able to do that, as long as it doesn't compromise my moral code, would be to start to look like, dress like, act like that thing that I want to become.</p>
</details>

### 高效沟通的VCE框架
**主持人：** 你认为沟通有多重要？对于如何成为一个有效的沟通者，你有什么建议？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How important do you think communication is in terms of like the way that you show up here and the way that you talk? Do you think that's important? And if so, what advice would you give to to my audience about being an effective communicator?</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 当然，沟通是最重要的事情。为了成功，你必须能够传达你的想法、你的思想、你是谁以及你的观点。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Of course, communication is the most important thing. Next to being successful, actually, I would say in order to be successful, you have to be able to communicate your ideas and your thoughts and who you are and your point of view.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 你自己是如何做的？你学到了哪些有效的沟通技巧，能让人们认真对待你、倾听你并被你说服？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, what do you do when you think about your own communication style? What are some of the things that you've learned over time that are effective to make people take you seriously to to hear you and to persuade people?</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 我在任何房间里都保持极高的专注度（presence）。这是一个在当今时代被忽视的技能。我的理念是，如果你身处那个房间，你的双脚在那里，你就必须在那里。如果你能真正追踪正在发生的事情，你就是一个有效的沟通者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I am incredibly present in any room that I am in. And that is a missed skill in a day and age where everyone has a cell phone where they can contact millions of people instantly. My philosophy is if you're in the room and your two feet are there, that is where you have to be. And so you are an effective communicator if you can actually track with what's happening.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 那么说话的方式呢？你见过的最有效的演讲者在战术上是怎么做的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What about how you speak? how the very the most effective speakers that you've encountered, what it is they do tactically to make sure that people hear what they're saying and are persuaded by them?</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 一个人拥有的沟通框架越多，就越能帮助他们清晰地表达观点。我的框架是**VCE框架**（Vision, Commitment, Execution: 愿景、承诺、执行）。在我每次真正想要传达并成功的沟通中，我都会使用这三个步骤。这个三步框架可以用于争取晋升、解雇员工，甚至可以用来决定当晚去哪里吃饭并说服你的伴侣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The more frameworks somebody has to frame their communication, I think helps them land their point. So there's no shortages of frameworks on the planet. My framework is vision, commitment, execution. I use three steps in every communication that I'm really intentional about and wanting to land. And that three-step framework can be used for getting a promotion. It could be used for laying people off. It could be used to figuring out where you're going to go to dinner that night and persuading your significant other.</p>
</details>

VCE框架的第一步是愿景（Vision）。愿景排在第一位很重要，因为如果你能向某人清晰地阐述你所沟通内容的意图和“为什么”，你会比直接进入战术层面走得更远。人们会忘记战术。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the first step of the framework under VCE is vision. And it's important that vision is first because if you can articulate to somebody the intention and the why behind whatever it is you're communicating, you're going to get much further than just going into tactics. And if it's tactics that you go into, people forget it. People don't remember tactics.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 给我举个例子。假设我是你的团队成员，你试图说服我开设一个Twitch频道做直播。你会如何运用这个框架？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So give me an example. I'm on your team and you're trying to persuade me to launch a Twitch channel to do live streaming. How how would you go through this framework to accomplish that goal?</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** （愿景）Cardone Ventures的使命是帮助企业主实现他们的个人、职业和财务目标。我们的目标是影响一百万企业主。我研究了Twitch，因为通过这个平台，我们的信息可以传达给这里的受众，从而极大地扩大我们的影响力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Card Ventures. Our mission is to help business owners achieve their personal, professional, and financial goals. And we're on a path to impact a million business owners. I was researching is Twitch because our impact could be greatly amplified by us having our message be to this audience to this crowd using Twitch.</p>
</details>

（承诺 Commitment）这有两步。第一，我的承诺：我会为你提供最好的培训，帮你建立账户，让你了解这个领域最顶尖的人，并介绍你认识他们，以便你能够全面启动并负责这个项目。第二，我要求的回报：我希望你非常认真地对待这件事，并与你将要见到的联系人保持跟进，确保他们明白你的意图是成为最优秀的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">vision commitment. There's two steps. First step, what is my commitment? I will provide you whatever training is the best training to get you set up with an account to get you the knowledge and education of people who are crushing it in the space. introduce you to those contacts in order for you to be able to fully launch this and be responsible for it. Commitment part two. What I'd ask for in return is you take that very seriously and with the contacts that you're going to be meeting, you follow up with them. You ensure that they understand that your intention is to be the best of the best.</p>
</details>

（执行 Execution）我的设想是这样的：我们会给你一个账户。我研究了这个平台，这里有三个人，我将投资5000美元让你去向他们学习、接受指导。在接下来的8周内，我们的目标必须是从零Twitch订阅者增长到10000名。我们每天都会沟通，以消除任何障碍，确保这个项目成功。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Execution. So, what I see this looking like is we're going to get you an account. I've researched this platform, and here are the three people that I'm going to invest $5,000 for you to go and learn from, be mentored by, and over the next 8 weeks, the target has to be we're going to go from zero Twitch subscribers to 10,000 Twitch subscribers. and we will check in every single day in order to remove any roadblocks in order for this to be a successful initiative.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 人们在这里常犯的错误是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And where do people go wrong here?</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 他们从执行开始。他们会说：“哦，我们需要上Twitch。”然后就把任务扔给团队，自己去做别的事了。他们没有把这件事与“为什么”联系起来。我们常常在没有得到对方承诺的情况下就直接进入执行阶段，然后等上4周、8周或12周，以为事情正在发生，而实际上什么都没发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They start with the execution. They're like, "Oh, we need to be on Twitch." This is what business owners do to their team. instead of really tying whatever the thing is that you're asking somebody to why is this important? But so often we drop right into execution without first getting the commitment from the other person that they're even interested. And then we wait 4 weeks or 8 weeks or 12 weeks thinking something is happening when it is not happening.</p>

### 努力工作与职业倦怠的真相
**主持人：** 努力工作在这个等式中扮演什么角色？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What about hard work in this equation? What would you say to people about the concept of working hard and how critical or or unimportant that is?</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 努力工作是最重要的事情。如果你想去的地方确实不寻常或超乎寻常，不努力工作是到不了的。你可以尝试走捷径，但那些通过努力获得成功的人，没有那种一切都会崩溃的焦虑，因为他们知道自己可以重来一次。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Working hard is the most important thing. You cannot get to where you want to go if it's truly something that is unusual or out of the ordinary without working hard. And you could try to hack it. but if you did it by putting in the effort, you don't have this anxiety that it's all going to come crashing down because you know that you could redo it.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 你工作有多努力？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, how hard do you work? If we look at an average week, why are you smiling?</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 我无时无刻不在工作。我生活中的每一件事都为我所做的工作进行了优化。因为我做的工作对我很重要。我正处于人生的一个阶段，我坚信我正在做的工作可以改变我的生活，也可以改变别人的生活。所以，如果我不花每一分钟去思考我能做什么来推动我热衷的工作，那将是自私的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm never not working. So, however many hours are in a day, everything in my life is optimized to the work that I do. Every single thing. Because the work that I do is important to me. And I'm in a phase of my life where I really do believe that the work that I'm doing can change my life. It can change others lives. So, it would be selfish of me to not spend every minute thinking about what I can do in order to help move the work that I do that I'm passionate about.</p>
</details>

努力工作绝不会导致职业倦怠，这是一个误解。我不认识那些仍在奋斗且成功的的人会因为漫长的一天而感到精疲力竭。我的商业伙伴格兰特·卡东（Grant Cardone）说：“你不是蜡烛，你不会燃尽。”人类是不会燃尽的，因为你不是蜡烛。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and never burnoutinducing though and I think that that's a misconception about hard work. I don't know successful people who are still in the game who are burnt out by a long day. My business partner Grant Cardone who I am obsessed with and that was one of the greatest partnerships I could have ever done in my entire life. He says, "You're not a candle. You can't burn out. A human being cannot burn out because you are not a candle."</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 那人们为什么会说自己“燃尽”了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Burnout then in your view, why do people say, do you know, I was doing this thing and I got burnt out so I had what is that?</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 人们所做的事情并没有真正引导他们去到他们想去的地方。如果你看不到你所做的牺牲将如何真正带你练出六块腹肌，如果你注定永远超重，那么我当然只会吃糖果和薯片。但因为我相信我能练出六块腹肌，所以我愿意做出一些牺牲，因为目标不会让我燃尽，当我达到目标时，我会为自己感到无比自豪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The thing that people do is not actually leading to where they want to go. If you're going to be overweight forever, then of course I'm just going to eat candy and chips and all the things that I love to eat. But I do think I could get a six-pack. So, I'm willing to make some of these sacrifices here and there because the goal isn't going to allow me to get burnt out because I'm going to be so freaking proud of myself by the time I reach that goal.</p>
</details>

### 平衡责任：别把孩子当借口
**主持人：** 有些人会想，你说得倒轻松，你没有孩子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's a I know my audience well enough to know that some of them will be thinking that's all right for you. You haven't got kids.</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 他们说得对。但你可以有孩子，成为一个好父母，同时也能大量工作。那么你的爱好就不再是做脸部护理，而是有意识地花时间陪伴你的孩子。但我会问他们一个问题：花多少时间陪孩子是合适的？每天两小时？很好，是专注的两小时，而不是四小时，其中一半时间在看电视、刷社交媒体、打电话、做饭。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They're right. you can have kids and be a great parent and also work a lot. And so then your hobby instead of me getting a facial would be you actually spending intentional time with your kids. But I would ask them this question. What is the appropriate amount of time to spend with your kids? Like how much is that? What would make you feel good about how much time you spent with your kids? Is it 2 hours a day? Okay, great. 2 hours focus time, dedicated time, not 4 hours. half of that on television, on social media, making calls, making dinner. No, that that that's not workable.</p>
</details>

我们倾向于用这些借口：“哦，我有生病的父母。”“哦，我有孩子。”我发现非常成功的人也拥有所有这些“哦，我有”。他们能够规划好，比如“我要在医院花这90分钟全心全意地陪我爸爸。”我爸爸其实不需要我陪6个小时，他需要的是90分钟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We tend to just use these excuses. Oh, I have sick parents. Oh, I have kids. Oh, I have. And I find that very successful people happen to have all of those. Oh, I haves. And many of them, not all of them, but many of them are able to figure out, okay, I'm going to spend this 90 minutes at the hospital fully locked in to my dad right now. My dad doesn't actually need me for 6 hours. My dad needs me for 90 minutes.</p>
</details>

我不认为孩子们看着父母拼命工作会对他们产生负面影响。我认为那是一种鼓舞人心的成长方式。我的父母都非常努力工作，我认为我之所以成为今天的我，部分原因就是因为我有这样了不起的父母，他们努力工作，并把自己的目标和成功放在重要位置。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think that kids are negatively impacted by watching their parents work their asses off. I think that that is an inspiring way to grow up. I had two parents who worked their tails off. And I do think that I am part of the way that I am because I had such incredible parents who worked hard and who prioritized their own goals and their own success as something that was important.</p>
</details>

### 成功的关键抉择：被尊重而非被喜欢
**主持人：** 对于那些感觉自己持续不被尊重的人，他们应该怎么做来赢得尊重？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what should someone do that is looking to earn the respect? Some someone that feels like they're continually disrespected. What would you say they should do to to earn people's respect?</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 一个人要赢得尊重，首先必须决定他们宁愿被尊重，也不愿被喜欢。这个权衡太常被做出了。当我们处于一个情境中，做正确且值得尊重的事情会让人不喜欢时，我们往往不选择做那件正确且值得尊重的事，而是优先考虑被喜欢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first thing somebody has to do in order to earn respect is to decide that they would rather be respected than liked. That trade-off is made too often. We're in a situation when the right respectful thing to do is unlikable. We don't choose the right respectable thing to do. We prioritize being liked.</p>
</details>

当你做出被尊重的决定，不再优先考虑别人对你的看法时，你就可以进入第二步：你必须在你想要获得尊重的领域里获得“数据”（stats）。如果你在一个组织里职位较低，或者周围有各种原因不尊重你的人，那么你专业领域的哪个方面是无可否认的？它必须是证据，存在于物理世界中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so when you make that decision to be respected and to not prioritize what everybody thinks about you, you can then transition into the second step which is you have to get stats in the area that you want respect in. If you're low in an organization or you have different people around you who don't respect you for a variety of different reasons. What is the area of your expertise that is undeniable? It's proof. It exists in the physical universe.</p>
</details>

### 设定界限：一个有争议的解雇决定
**主持人：** 为了赢得尊重，你是否发现必须加强和保护自己的界限？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Have you found that you've had to reinforce and protect your boundaries in order to earn that respect?</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 当然。我每天和数百名团队成员一起工作，他们有自己的观点和看法。我领导的定义是让别人的成功变得容易。那么，我需要成为什么样的人，设定什么样的界限？我曾在网上因公开分享一个解雇员工的TikTok视频而受到很多批评。我发现她背叛了她的伴侣，而出轨对象也有伴侣。我一发现这件事，就立刻解雇了他们两个人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Of course they do. I work with hundreds of team members every single day who have their own points of view and their own perspectives on what they want the work to look like, what they want our culture to look like. And I think I've had to wrestle with this so much because I want to create an environment where people can be successful. My definition of leadership is making other people's success easy. So, if I'm going to be a leader, I'm going to make other people's success easy. How would I go about doing that? What type of environment would they need to be in in order to actually make their success easy compared to their alternative, which is going down the street and trusting that some other leader is going to make them more successful. And so, I really wrestle with who I need to be and what the boundaries are that I set for myself. And one of the things I've gotten so much criticism of uh online was when I publicly shared a Tik Tok about firing somebody because I found out that she was cheating on her significant other and the other person also had a significant other. And as soon as I found out about it, I terminated both of them immediately.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 即使不是在工作时间发生的，你也会因为员工出轨而解雇他们？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But if it wasn't at work, you still even if it was, I would fire the person immediately. So you'd fire someone for cheating. Absolutely. On their partner.</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 绝对会。我不能容忍欺骗者。如果他们会欺骗那个本应与他们共度余生的人，你认为他们会不会在工作上作弊？你认为他们会不会欺骗我们的客户？你认为他们会有足够的道德和判断力，不被自己的个人道德问题分心，从而真正专注并做好工作吗？这样的人在任何环境中都是一个负债。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely. I can't have cheaters. If they're going to cheat on the person that they're supposed to spend the rest of their life with, do you think that they're cheating on their work? Do you think that they're going to cheat on our clients? Do you think that they're going to have the ethics and morals and judgment to not be so distracted with their own personal ethics situation that they can actually focus and do a good job? That person in any environment is a liability to the environment. It's a complete liability.</p>
</details>

### 突破瓶颈：如何规模化你的业务
**主持人：** 很多小企业主都说他们自己成了业务的瓶颈，尤其是在年收入达到一百万美元左右时，他们不知道如何超越自己去扩张。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so many small business owners will come up to me and say that they are they won't say it like this but what they're describing is that they're a bottleneck in their own business. They're at maybe I don't know a million in revenue. and they don't know how to scale beyond their typically like service based businesses where someone's doing a service for a client and uh what would you what do you say to those people when you've encountered them in your your company?</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 欢迎来到创业者的世界。这不是独特的挑战，而是预料之中的挑战。问题在于，他们技术上不知道如何培训别人去做他们擅长的事情，从而让自己能专注于企业主的首要角色：创造收入。你必须从“做”业务中抽身，进入到“规模化”业务运营中去。而这些只是你目前不具备的技能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Welcome to being an entrepreneur. This is not a unique set of challenges. This is an expected set of challenges. The statistics show that the challenges that business owners face at that break point of taking what they are doing that is working and transitioning that to having other people help them is part of the process. And so there is nothing wrong with this business owner. It's just that they don't technically know how to train somebody to do what they do well that then allows the business owner to focus on the business owner's primary role. And that primary role should be to generate revenue. You have to get out of the doing of your business and you have to get into the scaling of the operations of your business. And those are just skills that you don't currently have.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 核心技能是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what is that skill? What is the core skill there?</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 这是一项战术技能。打开他们的日历，看看他们每天做什么，通过流程创建来复制他们所做的、让他们自认为是“特殊雪花”的事情。然后，你需要经历一个四步流程来培训新人：首先，告诉他们该做什么（流程）；然后，向他们展示该怎么做；接着，让他们自己做，你来指导和提供反馈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a tactical skill. And the skill is opening up their calendar, looking at what they do every single day, duplicating through process creation what it is that they do that makes them a special snowflake in their mind. You're going to go through a four-step process. First, you're going to tell the person what they're supposed to do, aka the process. Ideally, then you show them what they're supposed to do so that they can see how this applies in real life. It's not just something on a document. Then you're going to let them do that thing. And you are going to coach them and provide them feedback on doing that thing.</p>

### AI时代的终极技能：学习与适应
**主持人：** 随着AI和机器人技术的发展，许多我们曾经雇人来做的技能正在变得多余。在你看来，未来的优势是什么？我应该加倍投入哪项技能，是机器人和AI无法从我这里偷走的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The edges are are going What is the edge of the future in your view? What is the edge? What is the skill I should double down on that the robots and AI aren't going to steal from me?</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 我认为，在AI的世界里，我们唯一能真正加倍投入的技能是学习和适应的能力。因为我们无法预测2040年的世界会是什么样子。我们不知道机器人能做什么或不能做什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the only skill that we can actually double down on in a world of AI is the skill of learning and adapting because we cannot predict what the world is going to look like in 2040. We do not know what robots are or aren't going to be capable of.</p>
</details>

一个人唯一能做的对冲就是适应和学习的能力。每个人都应该利用AI来提升学习能力。承认你所不知道的，这是一个人最大的优势。坦然地说：“我不知道如何阅读P&L。我不知道如何阅读这份法律合同。我对AI一无所知。”然后说服自己，为什么突破学习新事物的障碍是你最重要的技能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so the only hedge that somebody can have is the ability to adapt and learn. And what AI should be used for with every individual is the ability to learn. Acknowledge what you don't know. That is the greatest strength somebody has. Really be comfortable saying, "I do not know how to read a P&L. I don't know how to read this legal contract. I don't know anything about AI." And be able to convince yourself why that is the most important skill for you to push past that barrier of learning something new.</p>
</details>

你要有韧性地度过这个过程，对自己说：“我要通过这个过程去适应，我要到达另一边并学习，这样我就能具体地拥有自信，相信我可以在任何环境中根据需要做出改变，并为那个环境增加价值，无论外部环境如何。”这是唯一的选择，没有其他选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">To push back on that and to have some resilience through it to say, I'm going to adapt through this. I'm going to get to the other side and learn so that I concretely can have confidence that I can change in any environment based off of what's needed of me in that environment and I will add value to that environment regardless of whatever the external circumstances are. That is the only choice. There is no alternative choice.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 你对AI感到害怕吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Are you scared about AI?</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 我一点也不害怕。我非常兴奋。因为我曾经觉得自己很笨，觉得那些聪明人知道一些我不知道的事情。几年前，当AI出现时，我整个人生观都改变了。AI在两年内教会我的东西，是我可能需要上学、拿学位才能学到的。这是一个前所未有的时代，可以利用这个信息源，它能专门辅导你所不知道的东西，真正地装备你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm not scared at all. I'm pumped. As you can tell, I'm really excited because I used to feel dumb. I used to feel like there were things that these smart people knew that I didn't know. And my entire outlook on life changed a handful of years ago when this got launched because AI has taught me in two years what I would have had to go to school for and would have had to get a degree in still to just find out that most people who went to school for those things and had degrees in them missed something critical and important. And so for me, and I think people like me, and I don't think there's anything particularly special about who I categorize as people like me, it is a unprecedented time to lean into this reference of information that can specifically tutor you on what you don't know, to actually equip you.</p>

**娜塔莉：** 我希望观众中的每一个人，无论你年收入是6万美元、100万美元还是1亿美元，都能真正相信自己可以学会任何他们想知道的东西，并且那里实际上不存在任何障碍。因为如果我能让人们真正相信这一点，他们的整个生活都会因为他们今天拥有的渠道和工具而改变。

<p class="english-text">Did you used to think there were special characteristics or some kind of genetic genius gene that these people at the very top had and and how how did that change once you were in rooms with those people?</p>
</details>

**娜塔莉：** 当然，我曾经以为有人在出生前就按下了某个天才按钮。我从小就很难记住数字，我以为自己很笨。但当你接触到很多人，无论成功与否，你会发现每个人都有自己的那个“短板”。成功的人只是限制了他们允许自己相信的、导致他们不成功的借口数量。他们要么在自己的优势上加倍投入，忽略那个限制，要么意识到那个限制确实在限制他们，于是他们必须去攻克它，花时间去改进，从而从那里起跳。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Of course, I thought that there was some genius button that somebody clicked at birth before coming out of the womb where they just got to be special and they got to understand things. I really struggled growing up with remembering numbers. And for anybody who also struggles with that, what you would come to find out being around lots of people, successful or unsuccessful people, is everybody has that thing. So successful people just limit the amount of excuses that they allow themselves to believe for why they aren't successful. They take the limitation that they have and either they so overindex in the strength and they ignore that or they realize that that limitation is actually at a point where it is limiting them. So they have to attack it and take the time to get better and shore up that area to then be able to springboard from there.</p>
