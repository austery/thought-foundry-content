title: 市场周报：政府停摆下的劳动力市场与美联储的“万物泡沫”警告

### 市场概览与数据真空

大家好，今天是11月8日，这里是《市场周报》。过去一周，股市表现相当低迷，出现了显著的回调。但最终，标普500指数似乎在**50日移动平均线**（50-day moving average: 衡量过去50个交易日平均价格的指标）处获得了支撑并反弹，而且我们正处于一年中季节性表现相当积极的时期，因此目前我不会过于悲观。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Hello my friends. Today is November 8th and this is Markets Weekly. So this past week was a, you know, pretty down week in the stock market. We had a notable draw down, but at the end of the day, it looks like we tested and bounced off the 50-day moving average in the S&P 500, and we are in a time of the year where there's pretty positive seasonality. So, I wouldn't be too negative at the moment.</p>
</details>

上周本应是重要的**非农就业报告**（Non-Farm Payrolls Report: 美国劳工部发布的月度就业数据，反映除农业部门以外的就业情况）发布周，我们需要了解经济是否持续创造就业。然而，由于政府停摆，我们一无所获。事实上，我们甚至没有收到之前的报告，如果停摆继续，我们可能也无法获得下一份报告。因此，我们现在都处于“盲飞”状态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, last week would have been one of those big non-farm payrolls week where we got to figure out if the economy continues to create jobs. But because of the government shutdown, we got nothing. In fact, we didn't get the report before that. And if the shutdown continues, we might not get the next report either. So, we're all kind of flying blind.</p>
</details>

需要明确的是，市场有时关心经济数据，有时则不然。有时好数据是坏消息，有时坏数据是好消息。但无论如何，尽管我们没有官方数据，但仍有许多其他数据可以参考。因此，今天我们首先来看看一系列替代性的劳动力市场数据指标，了解它们在说什么。其次，我们来看看美联储最新的金融稳定报告，其中他们基本上指出存在一个“万物泡沫”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, to be clear, sometimes the market cares about economic data, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes good data is bad news, sometimes bad data is good news. But in any case, even though we don't have official data, there is a lot of other data we can look at. So today, let's first look at a range of alternative labor market data indicators and see what they're saying. And secondly, let's take a little look at the latest Fed financial stability report where they're basically saying there is an everything bubble. All right, starting with the labor market data.</p>
</details>

### 替代性劳动力市场数据分析

当然，就市场而言，劳动力数据的黄金标准是**非农就业报告**（Non-Farm Payrolls Report），尽管就业数据有时会被显著修正，但市场通常最关心它。然而，除此之外，还有许多其他就业市场数据指标。下一个最受欢迎的是由**ADP**（Automatic Data Processing: 一家提供薪酬处理服务的公司）发布的就业报告。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now of course the gold standard for labor market data as far as the market is concerned is the non-farmms pay perils report even though of course um jobs get revised away sometimes significantly the market usually cares most about that. Now after that though there are a lot of other indicators for jobs market data. The next most popular one is the jobs report put out by ADP.</p>
</details>

ADP是一家私营薪酬处理公司。基本上，如果你是一家私营公司，通常会雇人为你处理薪酬。ADP是该领域的一家大公司，他们为许多公司处理大量薪酬。因此，他们拥有相当好的样本量来了解经济状况。根据他们最新的报告，上个月经济创造了4万个就业岗位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ADP is a private payrolls processing company. So basically if you are a private company usually you hire someone to do your payroll for you. A big company in that sphere is ADP. So they process a lot of payroll for a lot of companies. So they have a pretty good sample size as to how the economy is doing. When it comes to jobs according to their latest report the economy created 40,000 jobs last month.</p>
</details>

这确实是一个不错的数字，也标志着比前两个月有所改善，此前我们甚至出现了负增长。所以，ADP基本上是在说，首先，就业增长水平为4万，虽然不算巨大，但至少劳动力市场在过去几个月没有恶化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, that is you know a decent chunk and it also marks an improvement over the prior two months where we've even had uh negative growth. So the ADP is basically saying that the economy know first off the level of job growth 40,000 not huge but the ADP is saying that at the minimum job market is not getting worse over the past few months.</p>
</details>

除了ADP，我们还有一家较小的薪酬处理公司，名为**Paychex**（Paychex: 一家提供薪酬和人力资源服务的公司）。同样，它比ADP小，但仍然有相当好的样本量。他们发布了关于就业增长和工资的指数。根据他们的数据，劳动力市场略有恶化，但幅度不大。他们的指数显示出一些下降。从他们的工资增长数据来看，工资似乎也在继续减速。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now after the ADP we also have a smaller payroll processing company called Paychecks. Again, it's smaller than the ADP, but it's still a pretty good sample size. They put out these indexes both on job growth and on wages. And according to their data, they're saying that the job market, you know, it's it's slightly deteriorating, but not in a major way. So, their indexes are showing some decline. Looking at their wage data growth, it also seems like wages continue to decelerate.</p>
</details>

我想明确一点，如果我们有**非农就业报告**（Non-Farm Payrolls Report），没有人会关心这些数据。通常人们会嘲笑ADP报告和这些私营公司报告，因为它们与至关重要的非农报告没有很好的相关性，但我们现在没有非农报告。因此，现在这些通常不太重要的报告获得了更多的关注。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, I want to be clear, if we have the NFP report, no one would be caring about this. And you know, usually people just laugh at these ADP reports, these private peer reports because they don't have a good relationship with the allimportant nonpartial report, but we don't have that. So, um, now these smaller, well, less usually less important reports, I get more airtime.</p>
</details>

但这并非我们获得的关于劳动力市场的唯一数据。我们还可以查看其他数据，例如**ISM调查**（Institute for Supply Management surveys: 供应管理协会调查，衡量制造业和服务业活动）。ISM调查的作用是询问公司本月与上月相比情况如何，他们会回答是更好、更差还是相同。所以它是一个**扩散指数**（diffusion index: 衡量经济活动扩张或收缩方向的指标），它衡量的是方向而不是水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But these aren't the only data we get on the labor market. We can also look at other things such as the ISM surveys. Now what the ISM surveys do is that they go and ask companies how they're how how this month is compared to the last month and they'll say that it's better or worse or the same. So it's a diffusion index. It measures the where we're going not the level.</p>
</details>

因此，即使每个人都说本月情况比上月好，它也无法真正告诉你好多少。所以它更多是关于方向。ISM调查的一个组成部分是就业，根据这些调查，低于50意味着处于收缩区域。就招聘而言，劳动力市场基本上继续恶化。看起来恶化的速度没有加快，但它仍然不是积极的。所以，这并没有描绘出一幅美好的图景。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So even if everyone is saying that things are better this month than the last month it doesn't really tell you how much better. So it's more about a direction. Now one of the components of these ISM surveys is unemployment and according to these surveys below 50 is you're in contractionary ter uh territory. Uh the labor market basically continues as far as hiring goes continues to uh warp to worsen. Um it looks like it's not worsening at an accelerating rate but it's still it's not it's not positive. So, you know, it's not painting a a great picture of this.</p>
</details>

除此之外，我们还有其他衡量指标。**芝加哥联邦储备银行**（Chicago Federal Reserve Bank）有一个全新的基于模型的劳动力市场衡量指标，他们表示劳动力市场环比出现了轻微的恶化。同样，他们的模型中缺少一些输入数据，但我猜测他们有办法弥补。他们基本上只是显示出非常轻微的基于模型的恶化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, beyond that, we also have other measures. Uh, the Chicago Fed has a brand new labor market uh modelbased measure, and what they're saying is that it looks like the labor market has month-over-month just mildly, mildly slight degree of deterioration. Again, they're missing some of the inputs in this model, but I'm guessing that they have ways to make up for it. They're just showing basically very slight uh model based deterioration.</p>
</details>

此外，我们还有失业金申请数据。通常每周我们都会收到联邦政府发布的州级失业金申请数据，人们会关注申请数量是否增加，以判断劳动力市场是否走弱。即使联邦政府停摆，州级机构仍然提供这方面的数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now beyond that we also have unemployment claims. Now usually every week we would get the a release from the federal government about state level unemployment claims and people would watch to see whether or not increasing claims suggest a weakening in the labor market. Now, even as the federal government shut down, the state-based agencies still provide uh data on this and looking at the aggregation of this, it looks like on a state unemployment claims basis, it doesn't seem like there's deterioration. Basically, things are as it were beforehand. So, um that's good.</p>
</details>

综合来看，从州失业金申请数据来看，似乎没有出现恶化。基本上，情况和以前一样。这是个好消息。最后一个数据点，同样，还有许多替代数据点，我只是指出了一些人们一直在讨论的，那就是来自**美国银行**（Bank of America: 一家大型美国银行）内部数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">aggregation of this, it looks like on a state unemployment claims basis, it doesn't seem like there's deterioration. Basically, things are as it were beforehand. So, um that's good. Now, the last data point, again, there are many alternative data points. I'm just pointing to a number of them that that people have been talking about is data based on internal data from the Bank of America.</p>
</details>

美国银行显然是一家巨型银行，所以他们有大量数据可供查看。根据他们内部数据创建的指标，劳动力市场基本上继续保持与过去相同的状况。所以，没有市场恶化，也没有改善。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, Bank of America obviously giant bank. So, they do have a lot of data to look at and based on metrics created by their internal data, the labor market continues to, you know, basically be as it was in the past. So, not market deterioration but also not improvement as well.</p>
</details>

### 劳动力市场总结与美联储政策影响

总而言之，回顾我们讨论的所有这些数据指标，劳动力市场基本上没有大的变化。在过去几个月的政府停摆期间，可能出现了一些轻微的恶化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, taking a step back, looking at all these data indicators that we were talking about, it looks like the labor market basically is broadly unchanged. Over the past few months, we've we've been uh under the government shutdown, maybe some slight deterioration.</p>
</details>

我认为这听起来是合理的。基于此，美联储官员似乎越来越倾向于**鹰派**（hawkish: 指央行倾向于通过提高利率来控制通货膨胀的政策立场）。尽管市场可能关心也可能不关心数据，但美联储肯定关心。由于劳动力市场没有出现任何恶化，目前看来，至少有一部分美联储官员正在反对12月降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I think that uh that sounds reasonable. And based on that, it seems like Fed speakers are leaning more and more hawkish. Now, even though the market may or may not care about data, the Fed definitely does. And since we haven't had any market deterioration in the labor market, it looks like at the moment speakers at least there is a growing contingency are pushing back against a December rate cut.</p>
</details>

市场仍然认为12月降息的可能性超过一半。但劳动力市场数据缺乏恶化，似乎给了美联储一些官员勇气，让他们认为既然我们正在“盲飞”，就应该等等看，缓慢行事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, the market can still continues to price a better than even chance of us cutting in December. But it seems like the lack of deterioration in the labor market data is uh giving some Fed officials some courage to to say that we should just wait and see since we're flying blind. Let's just do things slowly.</p>
</details>

### 美联储金融稳定报告：万物泡沫？

好的，接下来我想谈谈**美联储**（Federal Reserve: 美国中央银行）最新的金融稳定报告。美联储每年发布两次金融稳定报告。他们基本上只是审视金融系统中可能存在的一系列潜在脆弱性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, the next thing I want to talk about is the latest financial stability report from the Federal Reserve. Now, two times a year, the Fed puts out this financial stability report. Basically, they're just looking at a range of potential vulnerabilities in the financial system.</p>
</details>

审视这一点的一个显而易见的方式是查看**资产价格估值**（asset price valuations），因为他们的想法是，当资产估值过高时，它更容易受到回调的影响，这当然可能是危险的。美联储审视了一系列资产价格，基本上，他们认为所有资产价格都处于高位。当然，这对你们中的任何一个人来说都不足为奇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, one of the obvious ways to look at this is to look at asset price valuations because the thinking is when you have highly valued assets, it's more vulnerable to uh pullbacks, which of course could be could be dangerous. Now, the Fed looks at a range of asset prices and basically looking at all of them, they're suggesting that asset prices are elevated. Uh no surprise to any of you, of course.</p>
</details>

再来看看股票，传统上你会看像**市盈率**（PE ratio: Price-to-Earnings ratio，衡量公司股价与其每股收益之比）这样的指标。投资者为每股收益支付了多少钱？从历史市盈率来看，美联储发现这个指标显示估值偏高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, looking at equities and traditionally, you would look at something like a PE ratio. So how how much are investors paying out for our share earnings and looking at PE ratios historically speaking the Fed is finding that that measure is showing elevated valuations.</p>
</details>

另一种看待股票的方式是将其与**固定收益**（fixed income: 指债券等提供固定回报的投资产品）进行比较，看看股票投资者是否相对于固定收益支付了溢价，以及他们愿意支付多少溢价。这种**股权风险溢价**（equity risk premium: 投资者持有股票而非无风险资产所要求的额外回报）当然是依赖于模型的。根据美联储使用的模型，他们发现股票估值在历史上处于高位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Another way to look at equities of course is to compare equities to fixed income seeing whether or not um equity investors are no paying a premium relative to fixed income and how much premium they're they're willing to pay. Now this equity risk premium of course is model dependent based on the model defend is using they're finding that out equities are historically elevated valuation.</p>
</details>

我必须再次提醒大家，仅仅因为被高估并不一定意味着它会下跌。事实上，你可以这样看，这可能并不重要，因为被高估的东西可能会被更高估，而便宜的东西可能会变得更便宜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and again I have to remind everyone that just because you're overvalued doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to go down. In fact uh you could look at this and say that it probably doesn't really matter because things that can get overvalued can get even more overvalued and things that are cheap can become even cheaper.</p>
</details>

再来看看其他资产类别，比如**公司债券**（corporate bonds）。看待这个问题的一个经典方式是**利差**（spread: 两种证券收益率之间的差额）。投资者投资公司债券而非**美国国债**（treasuries: 美国国债）所要求的额外回报是多少？你可以看到公司债券利差非常小。这再次表明公司债券估值很高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now looking at other asset classes like corporate bonds and classic way to look at this is the spread. So how much extra return investors are demanding to invest in corporate bonds over treasuries. You can see that corporate bond spreads are pretty tight. So again that suggests that corporate bonds are richly valued looking at other asset classes but also looks at things like residential real estate.</p>
</details>

美联储还关注**住宅房地产**（residential real estate）等资产类别。从模型的角度评估住宅房地产的一种方式是比较房价与租金。同样，根据这个指标，美联储发现房价在历史上处于高位。当然，我们已经知道这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And one way to value residential real estate from a model perspective is to compare house prices to rents. Again, uh based on this measure, the Fed is finding that yes, home prices are historically elevated. Of course, we already know that. Um and of course, looking at another asset class which I thought was pretty interesting was farmland.</p>
</details>

当然，另一个我认为非常有趣的资产类别是农田。农田作为一种替代资产投资变得越来越受欢迎。当你将农田的价值与你能从农田获得的收入进行比较时，农田的估值似乎也处于历史高位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, farmland has become popular as an alternative asset to invest in. And when you value farmland relative to income you can get from farmland, it also looks like farmland is uh historically historically elevated.</p>
</details>

转到**商业房地产**（commercial real estate）。美联储正在审视商业房地产价格相对于其能产生的收入（相对于租金）的情况，他们也发现根据这个指标，商业房地产估值在历史上处于高位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moving on to commercial real estate. Fed is looking at commercial real estate prices relative to income it can generate relative to rents and it's also seeing that commercial real estate according to this metric is historically elevated.</p>
</details>

因此，纵观整个金融系统，美联储认为（至少美联储工作人员是这样说的），根据传统的估值指标，基本上所有资产的价格都处于高位。所以我猜测这可能在一定程度上影响了他们的政策决定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So looking across the broad financial system, the Fed is thinking that yes, well Fed staff at least is saying that according to conventional valuation metrics, asset prices across uh basically everything are elevated. So I I suspect that maybe on the margins plays some role in in informing their policy decisions.</p>
</details>

如果资产价格如此之高，这表明金融条件存在一定程度的宽松。所以，货币政策可能表明你并没有采取超级限制性的措施。但也要注意，美联储不会仅仅根据资产价格来制定政策。如果他们认为劳动力市场处于危险之中，他们就会降息。即使这意味着资产价格会变得更高估，那也无妨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Whereas um if asset prices are so elevated that suggests some degree of loose financial conditions. So maybe monetary policy suggests that you know you're not being super restrictive. But then also note that the Fed is not going to conduct policy solely based on asset prices. If they think the labor market is in danger, they will cut. And even if that means that asset prices will become even more valued, so be it.</p>
</details>

从他们的角度来看，降息是为了帮助那些因就业不足而受苦的人。如果这让富人变得更富，那也不是不帮助劳动力市场中受苦者的好理由。好的，这就是我今天准备的所有内容。非常感谢您的收听。下周再见。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you can't I mean, from their perspective, you're cutting rates to help people who are suffering from low employment. And if that makes a rich person even richer, that's not a good reason to to not help people who are suffering in the labor market. Uh so any case, that's all I prepared for today. And uh thanks so much for tuning in. Talk to you next week.</p>
</details>
