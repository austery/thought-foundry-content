### 历史性的收购提议

那是 2000 年 9 月。两位男士，**Reed Hastings** 和 **Marc Randolph**，飞往达拉斯去会见当时的电影界霸主 **Blockbuster**。他们提议 Blockbuster 收购他们那家苦苦挣扎的初创公司，名叫 **Netflix**。起初，这位 CEO 保持沉默，然后称 Netflix 为永远无法持久的“小众业务”。快进到今天。那个所谓的“小众业务”正准备吞并 **Warner Brothers**（华纳兄弟），这可是 **《哈利·波特》**、DC 宇宙和 HBO 背后的庞然大物。这个曾经的弱者不仅活了下来，还席卷了整个好莱坞和电影产业。以至于如今，Netflix 和好莱坞几乎成了同义词。女士们先生们，新年快乐。我们以媒体史上最大的一笔交易开启 2026 年。我将涵盖让 Netflix 变得不可触碰的数学逻辑、数据与艺术之间的文化冲突，以及 **Netflix** 收购 **Warner Brothers** 对电影业和整个娱乐界意味着什么。让我们开始吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

It's September 2000. Two men, Reed Hastings and Mark Randolph, fly to Dallas to meet Blogbuster, the king of the movie world at the time. They offer Blockbuster to buy their struggling startup called Netflix. At first, the CEO stays silent and then calls Netflix a niche business that would never last. Fast forward to today. That so-called niche business is just about to swallow Warner Brothers, the beast behind Harry Potter, DC, and HBO. Not only did the underdog survive, it took Hollywood and the entire movie industry by storm. So much so that Netflix and Hollywood are synonymous these days. Happy New Year, ladies and gentlemen. We're starting 2026 with the biggest deal in the history of media. I will cover the math that makes Netflix untouchable, the culture clash between data and artistry, and what the Netflix Warner Brothers acquisition means for the movie industry and entertainment as a whole. Let's dive in.

</details>

快速梳理一下时间线：2025 年 10 月，**Warner Brothers Discovery** 将公司挂牌出售。原因是灾难性的债务，大约 **430 亿美元**。12 月 5 日，**Netflix** 宣布将以 **820 亿美元** 收购 **Warner Brothers Discovery**，标志着历史上最大的媒体交易。那么，当我们说收购时，到底收购了什么？如你所知，华纳兄弟是一个企业集团，他们主要有两个业务分支。一个是娱乐，另一个是信息服务。娱乐包括 **Warner Brothers Discovery**、**HBO Max**、像蝙蝠侠或超人这样的 DC 特许经营权，当然还有 **《哈利·波特》**。然后还有有线电视网络、游戏部门和体育频道。Netflix 的交易仅涵盖娱乐服务，这意味着如果交易真的发生，Netflix 将获得 HBO 的所有内容、DC、哈利·波特和华纳兄弟内容库的访问权。但这笔收购尚待反垄断监管机构批准，绝对不能保证这一定会发生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

A quick timeline, October 2025, Warner Brothers Discovery is putting the company up for sale. The reason, catastrophic debts, around $43 billion. On December 5, Netflix announces that it would buy Warner Brothers Discovery for $82 billion, marking the largest media transaction in history. Now, when we say acquisition, what exactly is being acquired? Warner Brothers is a conglomerate, as you know, and they have two branches so to say, of business. One is entertainment, and the other one is information services. Entertainment includes Warner Brothers Discovery, HBO Max, DC franchises like Batman or Superman, and of course, Harry Potter. And then there are cable networks, their gaming division, and sports channels. The Netflix deal only covers entertainment services, which means that if it really happens, Netflix will get access to all of HBO's content, DC, Harry Potter, and Warner Brothers content library. But this acquisition is yet to be approved by antirust regulators and there's absolutely no guarantee that this will happen.

</details>

### 监管障碍与竞争对手

如果交易成行，我们何时能看到结果？目前交易处于审查阶段。它尚未完成，正由司法部反垄断局（Department of Justice Antitrust Division）甚至可能包括联邦贸易委员会（Federal Trade Commission）进行审核。先把这一点记下来，我稍后会回过头来讲。预计最早在 2026 年下半年完成交割，可能会延长到明年。值得一提的是，**Netflix** 并不是唯一表示兴趣的买家。**Paramount**（派拉蒙）也为此争取了数月，但 **Warner Brothers** 最终拒绝了 **Paramount** 提出的 **1080 亿美元** 的交易，我要强调的是，这比 Netflix 的报价还要高。原因在于他们表示特别想要 Netflix。Paramount 的报价有效期至 1 月 8 日，也就是几天前，但截至今天，Warner Brothers 已正式拒绝了 Paramount 更高的出价。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

But if it does, when are we going to see the result? The deal is in the review phase. It hasn't closed and it is with both the Department of Justice Antirust Division and potentially the Federal Trade Commission. Put a pin in this. I will come back to it. The closing is expected to take place in the second half of 2026 at the earliest, potentially extending into next year. It is worth mentioning that Netflix wasn't the only buyer that expressed interest. Paramount also fought for it for months, but Warner Brothers ended up turning down the $108 billion deal offered by Paramount, which let me emphasize is a larger offer than what they got offered by Netflix. The reason for that is because they said that they specifically wanted Netflix. The offer from Paramount stood until January 8th, which is a couple of days ago, but as of today, Warner Brothers has officially rejected Paramount's higher bid.

</details>

那么，为什么 **Netflix** 需要 **Warner Brothers**？还记得上次我们告诉你运营一个 YouTube 频道是什么样的，以及幕后发生了什么吗？是的。我唯一没告诉你的是运营一个制作团队是什么样的。从脚本编写、故事板制作、镜头规划、摄像机角度、布景设计、道具，到其他一百万件事。所以，我们需要一个视频制作软件，但必须是专门为 YouTube 运作的，专门针对我们的团队规模、频道主题、扩展计划，并且价格实惠。所以，是的，我在要求极其定制化的东西。但是，如果我构建一个完全定制并完全为我的业务量身定做的东西呢？这正是 **Rebolt** 旨在解决的问题。Rebolt 是一个无代码平台，让任何人都可以用简单的英语为任何类型、无论大小的企业构建自定义工具和 AI 代理。再说一次，这不仅仅是一个 VIP 编码应用程序。你可以为你的特定业务设计整个软件系统，无论规模大小。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So, why does Netflix need Warner Brothers? Remember last time we told you about what it's like to run a YouTube channel and what happens behind the scenes? Yeah. The only thing I didn't tell you about is what it's like to run a production team. from scripting, storyboarding, shot planning, camera angles, set design, props, and a million other things. So, we need a video production software, but the one that would work specifically for YouTube, specifically for our team size, our channel theme, our scaling plans, and be affordable. So, yes, I'm asking for something extremely customized. But what if I built something entirely custom and tailored exactly to my business? That is exactly what Rebolt came to fix. Rebolt is a noode platform that lets anyone build custom tools and AI agents for businesses, businesses of any kind, large or small, in plain English. Once again, it's not just a VIP coding app. You can build an entire software system designed for your specific business regardless of the size.

</details>

### 规模效应与增长瓶颈

流媒体服务是一个非常成熟的行业。如果我让你说出前三大流媒体服务，你可能会说 YouTube、Netflix 和 Amazon Video。当公司过了扩张阶段后，会发生一些非常具体的事情。当你是一个成熟领域的成熟、知名玩家时，就像足球界的 **David Beckham** 一样，收入和利润比订阅用户数量更重要。在科技行业工作多年后，我在求职面试中多次被问到一个非常典型的问题。问题通常是：为 YouTube 想出一个新产品，或者为 Netflix 想出一个新产品或新服务。如果你针对这类问题做过任何面试准备，你会看到的第一件事就是你必须考虑市场成熟度。Netflix 就是教科书般的案例。Netflix 是一个庞然大物。它非常成熟，非常稳固，每一个增量改进都需要不成比例的金钱和时间。他们简直太大了。收购 **Warner Brothers** 让他们在一夜之间获得了 **1.28 亿订阅用户**，加上向国际市场的扩张。最重要的是，这为他们节省了数年的增量收益时间。所以对 Netflix 来说，这是合理的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Streaming services is a very mature industry. If I ask you to name top three streaming services, you would probably say YouTube, Netflix, and Amazon video. And there's something very specific that happens to companies when they're past the phase of scaling. When you are a mature, well-known player in a mature field, much like David Beckham in football, revenue and profits matter more than subscriber count. After years of working in tech industry, there have been numerous times when I was asked a very typical question during a job interview. And the question goes like come up with a new product for YouTube or come up with a new product or a new service for Netflix. And if you go through any interview prep for these types of questions, the first thing that you're going to see is that you have to consider market maturity. And Netflix is a textbook case. Netflix is a beast. It is very mature, very established, and every incremental improvement takes disproportionate amount of money and time. They're simply too big. Acquisition of Warner Brothers gives them 128 million subscribers technically overnight, plus expansion into international markets. And most importantly, it saves them years of incremental gains. So for Netflix, it makes sense.

</details>

但是这对 **Warner Brothers** 有什么好处呢？要解释 Warner Brothers 为何背负如此巨额债务并最终沦落到寻求买家的地步，我们必须退后一步，回顾一家看似与电影业无关的公司：**AT&T**。2018 年，AT&T 收购了当时拥有 Warner Brothers、HBO 和 CNN 的 Time Warner。唯一的问题是，AT&T 不是一家娱乐制作企业，一家受监管的全国性电信垄断企业与一家创意娱乐公司的企业文化发生了碰撞。仅仅 3 年内，一切都走了下坡路，他们最终背负了巨额债务。对于 Warner 内部的人员——剪辑师、编剧、摄制组——这意味着裁员、招聘冻结和项目取消。正如一位分析师总结的那样，AT&T 成功地将一家价值 1500 亿美元的公司变成了一家仅仅三年后就背负 500 亿美元债务被出售的公司。所以对于 Warner Brothers 来说，原因很简单：不可持续的债务。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

But what's in it for Warner Brothers? To explain the reason Warner Brothers got such a massive debt and ended up in a position where they sought a buyer, we have to take a step back and recall the company that has seemingly nothing to do with the movie industry. AT&T. In 2018, AT&T acquired Time Warner, which owned Warner Brothers, HBO, and CNN at the time. The only problem, AT&T is not an entertainment production business and the corporate cultures of a regulated nationwide telecommunications monopoly and a creative entertainment company collided. Within just 3 years, it all went downhill and they ended up with lots of debt. For people inside Warner, editors, screenwriters, camera crews, it meant layoffs, hiring freezes, and cancel projects. As one analyst summarized, AT&T managed to turn a $150 billion company into a company they sold for $50 billion in debt a mere three years later. So for Warner Brothers, the reason is very simple. Unsustainable debts.

</details>

### 反垄断与市场定义

但即使这笔账对企业来说算得通，也有一群人可以用一支笔就扼杀这笔交易。让我们回到之前标记的那一点：司法部反垄断局。你认为司法部将做出的最具决定性的决定是什么？市场。决定他们正在分析哪个市场。这是法院在进行任何其他分析之前必须决定的最重要的一件事：市场的定义。你如何定义 Netflix 所在的市场？他们可以从广义上考虑整个娱乐业。如果是整个娱乐业，“娱乐”指的是什么？我们是在谈论有线电视、电视、YouTube、媒体、社交媒体、流媒体吗？如果是，此次收购不会引起垄断风险，因为市场上有很多参与者。但如果市场被狭义地定义，例如仅限“订阅流媒体”，此次收购可能被视为非法。为什么？因为 **Warner Brothers** 和 **Netflix** 的合并市场份额达到 **45%**，这就变成了垄断风险，在这种情况下，它对市场构成了威胁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

But even if the math makes sense for the business, there is one group of people who can kill this deal with a single penstroke. Let's come back to our pin. Department of Justice Antirust Division. What do you think is the most consequential decision that the Department of Justice is going to make? The market. The decision which market they're analyzing. This is the single most important thing that the court has to decide before any other analysis occurs. The definition of the market. And how do you define a market that Netflix is in? They can go broadly and consider entertainment as a whole. If it's entertainment as a whole, what is meant by entertainment? Are we talking cable, TV, YouTube, media, social media, streaming? If yes, the acquisition does not raise a risk of monopoly because there is a ton of players on the market. But if the market is defined narrowly, for example, subscription streaming only, the acquisition can be deemed illegal. Why? because the combined market of Warner Brothers and Netflix reaches 45% and it becomes a monopoly risk and in that case it is a threat to the market.

</details>

你可能会问，Netflix 难道不已经是垄断者了吗？是的，理论上是，但实际上 Netflix 并不拥有垄断级别的权力。当 Netflix 提价时，它仍然会失去客户。每一次价格上涨都会引发可衡量的**用户流失**（Churn: 用户取消订阅的比率），这意味着用户有替代选择并且可以离开。当他们过去提价时，成千上万的订阅者在短时间内取消了订阅，这证明 Netflix 不能毫无后果地设定价格。他们的价格是本地化的。印度的套餐比美国便宜 70%，因为印度的消费者不会支付美国的价格。最后，Netflix 推出了带有广告的低成本套餐，以留住或赢回对价格敏感的消费者，而不是简单地把所有人都推向高价套餐。但抛开法律技术细节不谈，Netflix 是买方而不是卖方是有原因的。要理解为什么，我们必须看看他们实际如何赚钱和花钱的经济学。但正如我们将要看到的，这种效率水平伴随着一个非常具体且极具争议的权衡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

You may ask isn't Netflix already a monopoly? Yes, in theory but in practice Netflix does not have monopoly level power. Netflix still loses customers when it raises prices. Every price increase triggers measurable churn, which means that users have alternatives and can walk away. When they rose prices in the past, thousands of subscribers cancelled in a short period of time, which proves that Netflix cannot set prices without any consequences. Their prices are localized. Plans in India are 70% cheaper than those in the US because consumers in India will not pay American rates. And lastly, Netflix launched a lowerc cost plan with ads to keep or win back price sensitive consumers instead of simply pushing everybody into the high price plan. But legal technicalities aside, there is a reason Netflix is the one buying and not the one being sold. To understand why, we have to look at the economics of how they actually make and spend their money. But as we're about to see, that level of efficiency comes with a very specific and very controversial trade-off.

</details>

### “Zara模式”的经济学

让我们看看数学。Netflix 的经济学。Netflix 仅仅是一个内容聚合商的日子早已一去不复返了。他们成为了定义行业的内容制作商。《王冠》、《鱿鱼游戏》、《后翼弃兵》、《怒呛人生》等等。10 年前，他们是先驱。他们很大胆。他们创造了像《黑镜》以及随后的《潘达斯奈基》这样的革命性剧集。对于那些可能错过了《潘达斯奈基》的人来说，这是一个你有权决定改变情节的节目。每当角色必须做出重要决定时，你就是那个选择他们做什么的人。《毒枭》、《青春无密语》、《怪奇物语》、《去他*的世界》（我绝对的最爱）。但随着时间的推移，我们看到的这类作品越来越少。是的，所有这些都是 Netflix 原创，这些节目给了我们很多理由与朋友和家人聚在一起，放下手头的一切，在周末或假期狂欢看剧。但同样，不幸的是，规模是有代价的。Netflix 原创内容的大部分一直都很平庸，数据证明了这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Let's look at the math. The economics of Netflix. Long gone are the days when Netflix was just a content aggregator. They became an industrydefining content producer. The Crown, Squid Game, The Queen's Gambit, Beef, and so many more. 10 years ago, they were pioneers. They were bold. They created revolutionary shows like Black Mirror and subsequently Bander Snatch. For those of you who might have missed Banner Snatch, it is a show where you have the power to make a decision to change the plot. Every time a character has to make an important decision, you're the one who chooses what they do. Narcos, Adolescence, Stranger Things, The End of the World, my absolute favorite. But as time goes on, we're seeing fewer of these. Yes, all of these are Netflix originals, and these shows gave us lots of reasons to get together with friends and family, drop everything you had to do, and binge watch a show on the weekend or holiday season. But again, unfortunately, scale comes at a cost. The bulk of Netflix's original content has been consistently mediocre, and the data proves it.

</details>

普遍感觉质量在下降，Reddit 上有无数关于此的讨论帖，但生意——生意却在蓬勃发展。仔细听好，这笔账很疯狂。Netflix 2025 年的内容预算预计为 **180 亿美元**。尽管这一数字多年来一直在上升，但他们的 CFO 表示，在内容支出方面，他们远未达到上限。你可能会问，180 亿美元很多吗？从宏观角度来看，并不算多。为了对比，以下是 Netflix 竞争对手的支出：**Disney** 所有部门共 300 亿美元。**Warner Brothers Discovery** 195 亿美元。**Paramount** 150 亿美元。就质量而言，Netflix 的巅峰年份是 2019 年，随后便开始下滑。无论他们每年发布 3 部还是 300 部电影，Netflix 原创电影的平均评分都在 5 到 6 分之间。尽管如此，自 2015 年以来观众增长了 350%，拥有 **3 亿付费用户**，低流失率，流失后高回归率，订阅价格自 2018 年以来上涨了 65%。这意味着 Netflix 的**单位经济效益**（Unit Economics）非常高效，这也是使他们极具收购或合并吸引力的原因之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

There is a general sense of deteriorating quality, and Reddit has numerous threads on this, but the business, the business is flourishing. Listen closely, the math is wild. Netflix's content budget for 2025 was projected at $18 billion. And even though it's been rising for years, their CFO stated that they're nowhere near a ceiling when it comes to content spending. You may ask, is $18 billion a lot? In the grand scheme of things, not really. To put this in perspective, here's how much Netflix's competitors spend. Disney $30 billion across all divisions. Warner Brothers Discovery 19.5 billion. Paramount 15 billion. The peak year for Netflix in the context of quality was 2019 with further decline. Their average rating on Netflix original movies is between five and six across all years regardless of whether they release three or 300 films per year. Nevertheless, audience growth 350% since 2015, 300 million paid users, low churn, high comeback ratio after churn, and subscription price went up 65% since 2018. What this means is that Netflix's unit economics are highly efficient, which is one of the things that makes them highly attractive for an acquisition or a merger.

</details>

所以，不管你怎么评价质量，现实是他们现在太成熟了，以至于他们可以承受平庸，却依然主宰市场。Netflix 是流媒体服务界的 **Zara**，我是作为赞美来说的。Zara 是一个非凡的品牌。他们让许多人无法企及的秀场时尚变得符合中等收入人群的预算。我们喜欢 Zara 的本质。你会去那里买一套参加晚宴的西装吗？可能不会。但你会去那里买一条日常穿的牛仔裤吗？绝对会。所以 Netflix 就像 Zara 一样，以可接受的价格为各种口味和观看习惯的观众带来各种内容。是的，有时它是《鱿鱼游戏》，有时它是一件洗三次就散架的 10 美元衬衫。尽管如此，这是一个非常强大的业务。这次收购对流媒体行业意味着什么？我们可能会目睹三种可能的结果。结果一，交易被监管机构阻止。如果司法部将市场狭义地定义为仅限订阅流媒体，交易就会告吹。结果二，交易获批，HBO 文化得以保留。这是最好的情况，我们既得到了 Netflix 的规模，又保留了 HBO 的艺术性。结果三，交易获批，HBO 被吸收，包括文化转变。Netflix 将其完播率指标应用于 HBO 的内容决策。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So, say what you will about the quality, but the reality is they're so mature now that they can afford to be mediocre and still dominate the market. Netflix is the Zara of streaming services, and I mean it as a praise. Zara is a phenomenal brand. They made unachievable for many runway fashion available to a midlevel pocket budget. And we like Zara for what it is. Would you go there to buy a suit for a gala? Probably not. But would you go there for a pair of jeans for everyday? Absolutely. So Netflix, just like Zara, brings all sorts of content for all kinds of viewers with all kinds of tastes and viewing habits at an accessible price. And yes, sometimes it's Squid Game and sometimes it's a $10 shirt that falls apart after three washes. Nevertheless, a very strong business. What does this acquisition mean for the streaming industry? There are three possible outcomes we might witness. Outcome one, deal blocked by regulators. If the Department of Justice defines the market narrowly as subscription streaming only, the deal dies. Outcome two, deal approved. HBO culture is preserved. This is the best case scenario where we get Netflix's scale and HBO's artistry. Outcome three, deal approved, HBO absorbed, including culture shift. Netflix applies its completion rate metrics to HBO content decisions.

</details>

### 数据与艺术的冲突

简单说几句为什么这很重要，以及为什么 HBO 文化的消亡是围绕这次收购的最大担忧。产品文化是一家科技公司的脉搏。通常，描述服务或产品的方式是该业务内部产品文化的试金石。Netflix 的目标是让每个观众看完他们开始的剧集。他们不一定关心观看该节目的绝对人数。他们关心的是你是否看完了你开始看的节目。对他们来说重要的是，如果你开始了，你就必须结束。Netflix 有一条严格的规则。如果开始观看该节目的观众中只有不到 50% 的人看完了这一季，该节目就会被取消。这是 Netflix 对任何节目续订决策的基础。《一猎成名》（First Kill），首月观看时长 9700 万小时，被取消。**完播率**（Completion Rate），44%。《1899》，广受好评的德国科幻片，一季后被取消，完播率 32%。《太阳召唤》（Shadow and Bone），2023 年上半年观看人数最多的被取消节目。被取消是因为它没有达到 Netflix 的效率基准，但完播率达到 50% 的节目无论总观看人数如何都会获得续订。《心跳漏一拍》（Heartstopper），顺便说一句我很喜欢，观看时长 5300 万小时，只有《一猎成名》的一半，却续订了多季。完播率 73%。《双城之战》（Arcane）完播率 60%，尽管受众小众仍获续订。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

A few words on why this is important and why the absorbance of HBO culture is the biggest concern around this acquisition. Product culture is the pulse of a tech company. Typically, the way one describes a service or a product is the litmus test of the product culture within that business. Netflix aims for each viewer to complete the series they started. They don't necessarily care about the absolute numbers of people who watch the show. They care that you finish the show that you started. What matters to them is that if you start, you have to finish. Netflix has a strict rule. If fewer than 50% of viewers who started the show finish the season, the show gets cancelled. This is the very foundation of Netflix's renewal decisions for any show. First Kill, 97 million hours watched in the first month, cancelled. Completion rate, 44%. 1899, critically acclaimed German sci-fi, cancelled after one season, completion rate 32%. Shadow and Bone, most watched cancelled show of the first half of 2023. cancelled because it did not reach Netflix's efficiency baseline, but shows with 50% completion rate get renewed regardless of total viewing numbers. Heartstoppper, which I loved, by the way, 53 million hours watched, that is 50% watch time compared to the first skill yet renewed for multiple seasons. Completion rate 73%. Arcane 60% completion rate renewed despite niche audience, but shows with 50% completion rate get renewed regardless of the total viewing numbers.

</details>

这意味着 Netflix 的产品文化围绕着完播率展开。再说一次，Netflix 不太关心有多少人看，而更关心那些开始看的人是否看完。另一方面，HBO 的产品文化可以用一句话来表达：“这不是电视，这是 HBO。”多年来，HBO 的使命一直是给艺术家资源和时间，然后别挡他们的道。例如，《黑道家族》（The Sopranos），一部广受好评的顶级剧集，具有心理复杂性和情节效率。《火线》（The Wire），以节奏缓慢著称，如果按 Netflix 的完播率标准绝对活不下来，却成为了电视史上最受好评的剧集。HBO 以其标志性风格而闻名，这与 Netflix 截然不同。HBO 的声誉建立在慢热、具有挑战性和复杂的叙事以及非常具体的艺术视野之上。但我反对在“坏 Netflix”和“好 HBO”之间进行非黑即白的划分，原因在于如果你从这个等式中去除偏见并比较认可度，你会发现它们几乎不相上下。自 2016 年以来，HBO 和 HBO Max 制作了 34 部 Metacritic 评分 74 分以上的顶级电视剧。Netflix 在同一时期制作了 33 部。截至 2022 年，HBO 获得了 130 项艾美奖提名，19 次获奖。Netflix 获得 129 项提名，44 次获奖。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

What this means is that the product culture at Netflix revolves around completion rates. Once again, Netflix cares less about how many people watch and more about whether those who start finish. HBO's product culture, on the other hand, can be expressed in one sentence. It's not TV, it's HBO. HBO's mission for years has been to give artists resources and time and then get out of their way. For example, The Sopranos, a critically acclaimed prestige show with psychological complexity and plot efficiency. The Wire, notoriously slow paced for a season that would never survive Netflix's completion rate, became the most critically acclaimed show in television history. HBO is known for its signature style, which differs dramatically from Netflix's. HBO built its reputation on slow burns, challenging and complex narratives, and very specific artistic vision. But the reason I'm against black and white division between bad Netflix and good HBO is because if you remove the bias out of this equation and compare the recognitions, you will see that they're pretty much on par. Since 2016, HBO and HBO Max produced 34 prestige TV shows with Metacritic rating 74 plus. Netflix produced 33 in the same time period. HBO got 130 Emmy nominations, 19 wins as of 2022. Netflix 129 nominations with 44 wins.

</details>

### 流媒体战争的终结

这就是为什么我说不是一个比另一个好。这是关于完全相反的产品文化。如果 Netflix 是 Zara，HBO 就是限量版的 **Hermès**（爱马仕）。两者都有各自的市场。两者都有各自的受众。这些受众之间有重叠吗？是的，在一定程度上，但如果 Zara 要收购 Hermès，你会担心吗？是的，你会。这是可以理解的。这次收购可能是流媒体战争的决定性时刻。连续九年，Netflix 作为内容聚合商基本上没有受到挑战。它从制片厂获得内容授权，这些制片厂并不将 Netflix 和整个流媒体视为威胁。他们在没有实质性竞争的情况下建立了 1 亿用户的订阅基础。制片厂很乐意向他们授权内容，因为那是轻松赚来的钱。一切都很美好，直到 2019 年，电视和电影行业突然想，为什么我们不都推出流媒体服务呢？就在那时，流媒体战争开始了，每家主要媒体公司都推出了自己的流媒体服务。Disney Plus、HBO Max、Paramount Plus、Amazon Video。Disney、NBC、Warner Brothers，所有这些公司都停止向 Netflix 授权内容。Netflix 在价格上受到削弱，因为新服务每月的费用为 7 到 10 美元，而 Netflix 为 16 美元。最重要的是，每个平台都开始内部制作以推出原创内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

This is why I'm saying that it's not that one is better than the other. It's about completely opposite product cultures. If Netflix is Zara, HBO is a limited edition Hermes. Both have their markets. Both have their audiences. Is there an overlap between those audiences? Yes, to an extent, but would you get concerns if Zara were to acquire Hermes? Yes, you would. Understandingly so. The acquisition is potentially the decisive moment for streaming wars. For nine years in a row, Netflix was basically uncontested as a content aggregator. It licensed content from studios who did not view Netflix and streaming as a whole as a threat. They built subscriber base of a 100 million users without meaningful competition. And studios were happy to license content to them because it was easy money. And all of it was fine and dandy until 2019 when the TV and movie industry were like, why don't we all launch streaming services and that's when the streaming wars began when every major media company launched their own streaming service. Disney Plus, HBO Max, Paramount Plus, Amazon Video, Disney, NBS, Warner Brothers, all of them stopped licensing their content to Netflix. Netflix was undercut on pricing because the new services were coming at $7 to $10 per month versus Netflix's 16. And on top of it, every platform began its in-house production to spin out original content.

到 2022 年，流媒体泡沫开始破裂，炒作开始消退。很明显，这笔账算不过来。内部制作没有得到回报，许多推出的流媒体服务根本不盈利。这就是 Netflix 的数学变得不可战胜的地方。内容成本不会线性增长。Netflix 花费 180 亿美元服务 **3.1 亿订阅用户**。这相当于每年每位订阅者 **58 美元**。Warner Brothers Discovery 花费 195 亿美元服务 1.28 亿订阅用户。那是每位订阅者 **152 美元**。如果没有 Netflix 的规模，你根本无法通过花钱达到 Netflix 的效率。在流媒体经济学中有一个门槛，你需要至少约 **2.5 亿订阅用户**才能实现盈利。为什么？因为一部顶级电视剧每季的成本在 1 亿到 2 亿美元之间。例如，《龙之家族》、《怪奇物语》。如果你有 5000 万订阅者，那就是每部剧每位订阅者分摊 2 到 4 美元。如果你有 3 亿订阅者，那就是每部剧每位订阅者分摊不到 1 美元。在 5000 万到 1 亿订阅用户时，你每年大概能负担得起 10 到 20 部顶级剧集，否则单位经济效益就会崩溃。在 3 亿订阅用户时，你可以负担得起 50 到 100 部顶级剧集，同时保持单位经济效益。

By 2022, the streaming bubble started deflating and the hype began to wear off. It became obvious that math ain't mathing. In-house production was not paying off, and many of the streaming services that launched simply weren't profitable. And this is where Netflix's math becomes unbeatable. Content costs don't scale linearly. Netflix spends $18 billion serving 310 million subscribers. That is $58 per subscriber annually. Warner Brothers Discovery spent 19 and a half billion serving 128 million subscribers. That's 152 per subscriber. You simply cannot spend your way to Netflix's efficiency without Netflix's scale. There is a threshold in streaming economics where you need about 250 million subs minimum to achieve profitability. Why? Because a prestige TV series costs between $100 and $200 million per season. Examples, House of Dragon, Stranger Things. If you have 50 million subscribers, that is $2 to4 per subscriber per show. If you have 300 million subscribers, that is less than a dollar per subscriber per show. At 50 to 100 million subs, you can afford about 10 to 20 prestige shows annually before unit economics break. At 300 million subscribers, you can afford 50 to 100 prestige shows while maintaining unit economics.

流媒体战争可能在这次收购后结束的原因是，一旦 Netflix 凭借 HBO Max 的内容库达到超过 **4 亿订阅用户**，Netflix 与所有竞争对手之间的经济差距将变得不可逾越。Netflix 的噩梦是让 Paramount 合并或收购 Warner Brothers，因为它们加在一起将拥有 2.28 亿订阅用户，并拥有包括《哈利·波特》、《指环王》、HBO 的杰作和 Paramount 所有电影在内的联合内容库。结合消费能力、足以在每用户内容支出上竞争的规模（这是迄今为止流媒体服务盈利的最大障碍），以及与体育联盟的潜在合同。Netflix 向 Warner Brothers 提出的报价使他们能够消除市场中部的崩溃，这让他们回到了 2010 年代中期的地位，那时你要么拥有 Netflix 的规模，要么慢慢死去。结论：Netflix 从一个小众初创公司变成了发号施令的帝国。但随着 Netflix 吞并 Warner Brothers，我们必须明白这是有代价的。Netflix 已经证明效率胜过声望，并且可以买下艺术视野。那么，HBO 的慢热杰作时代结束了吗？我们拭目以待。但曾经的弱者现在成了帝国。让我们只希望他们还记得我们最初为什么开始看剧。希望这对你有帮助。感谢观看。下次见。再见。

The reason why streaming wars may end after this acquisition is because once Netflix reaches more than 400 million subscribers with HBO's Max's library, the economic gap between Netflix and all competitors becomes insurmountable. Netflix's nightmare would be to let Paramount merge or acquire Warner Brothers because together they would have 228 million subs with combined content libraries including Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, HBO's masterpieces, and all of Paramount's movies. combines spending power, sufficient scale to compete on content spending per subscriber, which is the biggest blocker to date when it comes to profitability for streaming services, and potential contracts with Sports League. The offer Netflix made to Warner Brothers allows them to eliminate the middle of the market collapse, which brings them back to the position they were in in mid 2010s, when you either have Netflix scale or you die slowly. Conclusion: Netflix went from being the niche startup to the empire that calls the shots. But as Netflix swallows Warner Brothers, we have to understand that it comes at a cost. Netflix has proven that efficiency beats prestige and can buy the artistic vision. So, is the HBO era of slowb burn masterpieces over? We'll see. But the underdog is now the Empire. Let's just hope that they remember why we started watching in the first place. We hope this was helpful. Thanks for watching. Till next time. Bye.
