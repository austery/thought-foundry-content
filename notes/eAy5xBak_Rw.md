### 爱泼斯坦案新文件发布

来自《纽约时报》，我是瑞秋·亚伯拉姆斯，这里是《每日》播客。最新发布的与性犯罪者杰弗里·爱泼斯坦相关的**文件**，未能解答关于他如何崛起、以及他与总统之间联系的关键问题。今天，我的同事大卫·恩里奇将解释他如何与一群记者一起，努力填补这些**谜团**，并揭示杰弗里·爱泼斯坦**出身**的真相。今天是12月23日，星期二。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams and this is the Daily. The latest release of files related to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein left key questions about his rise to power and his connections to the president unanswered. Today, my colleague David Enrich explains how he and a team of reporters worked to fill in those mysteries and reveal the truth about Jeffrey Epstein's origins. It's Tuesday, December 23rd.

### 文件发布与初步解读

大卫·恩里奇，欢迎来到节目。>> 谢谢。>> 大卫，我想这可能你今年第四五次来节目谈论杰弗里·爱泼斯坦了。这次请你回来，是因为周五**司法部**发布了**海量文件**，据我所知，这些文件并未真正增进我们对杰弗里·爱泼斯坦、他的罪行或他身边人的理解。你能告诉我们你认为最大的**收获**是什么吗？>> 这是一个难题，因为**收获**并不巨大，我们得到了一些零散的、渐进的细节和信息，它们强化了爱泼斯坦罪行的**极端恶劣**以及他所做的**可怕事情**。我们也获得了一些新的**零星信息**。例如，我们看到了**比尔·克林顿**与爱泼斯坦及其同伙的**多张照片**，包括在**游泳池**里。我们看到爱泼斯坦的一名**受害者**早在1996年就曾向**FBI**举报他持有**儿童性虐待材料**。这比我们所知联邦检察官开始调查爱泼斯坦早了整整十年。所以，这确实是一个**新进展**。但总的来说，这里没有**根本性地改变**我们对爱泼斯坦及其**网络**的理解的内容。值得注意的是，关于**唐纳德·特朗普**的内容也**少得可怜**，他的名字在这些文件中几乎没有被提及。而正是特朗普与爱泼斯坦的关系，最初引发了对此次调查的**大量政治关注**。

David Enrich, welcome to the show. >> Thanks for having me. >> David, I think this is probably your fourth or fifth appearance on the show this year to talk about Jeffrey Epstein. And this time we're having you back because on Friday there was obviously this massive file release from the Justice Department that as far as I understand it did not really advance our understanding of Jeffrey Epstein or his crimes or the people in his orbit. Can you tell us what you think the biggest takeaways were? >> It's a hard question because there were not huge takeaways and we got lots of bits of incremental color and detail that reinforced the deep depravity of Epstein's crimes and the horrible things he was doing. We also got some new tidbits. We saw, for example, Bill Clinton in numerous photos with Epstein and his associates, including in a swimming pool. We saw that one of Epste's victims back in 1996 had reported him to the FBI for having child sexual abuse material. And that's a decade before we know the federal prosecutors actually started investigating Epstein. So that was a definitely a new development. But for the most part, there was nothing here that fundamentally altered our understanding of Epstein and his network. and notably also very little about Donald Trump whose name was barely mentioned in these files. And it was Trump's relationship with Epstein that triggered a lot of the political interest in this investigation to begin with.

### 文件发布的背景与疑虑

>> 对。提醒一下大家，这次**文件发布**是因为**巨大的压力**，主要是来自**民主党**，也有一些来自**MAGA阵营**内部，要求**唐纳德·特朗普**及其政府发布所谓的“**爱泼斯坦文件**”，对吧？这基本上迫使特朗普签署了**立法**，授权**司法部**发布这些文件。>> 是的。值得注意的是，**司法部**并没有履行其法律义务，即**发布所有文件**。而且，已发布的文件在许多情况下都经过了**大量删减**，以至于你无法从中获得任何有意义的信息。>> 他们为什么不发布呢？**司法部**表示，他们将在**未来几周内**以**滚动方式**发布剩余文件，并且他们需要额外的时间来**妥善审查和删减**这些海量材料。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Right. Just to remind people, this whole file of release is coming about because of a massive pressure campaign, mostly from Democrats, but also from some within the MAGA orbit for Donald Trump and his administration to release the so-called Epstein files, right? And that basically forced Trump to sign legislation authorizing these files to be released from the Justice Department. >> Yeah. It's worth noting that the Justice Department did not do what it was legally required to do, which was release all of the files. And those files that were released were in many cases so heavily redacted that you couldn't make any sense of them. >> And why didn't they release them? The Justice Department has said that they will release the rest of the files on an kind of a rolling basis over the next few weeks and that they need this additional time to be able to properly review and redact these huge quantities of materials.

</details>

### 记者团队的深入调查

>> 好的。那么，知道会有这种**分批发布**，你原本期望从中获得什么？或者更重要的是，你希望这批文件能回答哪些问题？我的意思是，这取决于你的**视角**和你**关注点**。我想，许多**受害者**以及许多长期关注爱泼斯坦的人们最关心的问题之一是：是否还有其他**男性**在**纵容**他或与他一同参与**性犯罪**？对我而言，我和我的同事们——**马特·戈尔德斯坦**、**杰西卡·西尔弗·格林伯格**和**史蒂夫·厄尔**——已经合作了数月，试图真正理解爱泼斯坦构建的**金融网络**，并审视他的**出身**，以及他是如何从一个**赤贫**到**富豪**的故事，他如何将自己从一个**工人阶级家庭**转变为一个**极其富有且人脉广泛**的人。因此，我们想知道这些文件是否会有关于这方面的**启示**。在这方面，我们感到**完全失望**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Okay. So, knowing that there would be this sort of staggered release, what were you expecting to get or or maybe more importantly, what questions were you hoping that this batch of files would actually answer? I mean it depends on your perspective and what your interest is in this. I mean I think one of the biggest questions that many victims have and many people who have been focusing on Epste for a while are are there other men who were enabling him or participating in sex crimes with him. And for me and my colleagues, I I've been working with Matt Goldstein, Jessica Silver Greenberg, and Steve Eer for months now to really understand Epstein's financial web that he wo and looking at his origins and how he went from kind of this rags to rich's story where he managed to transform himself from a working-class family into an extraordinarily rich and well-connected person. And so we were wondering if there would be any revelations in these files about that. And we're just completely disappointed in that regard.

### 探寻爱泼斯坦的早期足迹

>>  well, that reporting that you mentioned is what I want to talk to you about because everybody's been eagerly awaiting the release of these files, right? Like hoping perhaps that the files would address some of these enduring questions about Epstein and his crimes. And obviously that did not happen on Friday. But you and our colleagues have been digging into a different period of Epstein's life, one that preceded the era of his most flagrant criminal activity that he became known for, that he was arrested for. Why was that period your focus? Why was it important in your estimation to understand the early period of Epstein's life? Well, Epstein built an extensive sex trafficking operation all over the world and that was really expensive and it required the support of a lot of powerful people. And so the question for us has been how did he get in a position where he had the money and the power and the connections to do that. This was a guy who came from a really working-class background. He grew up in Coney Island in Brooklyn. His dad was an employee of the New York City parks department. He was really kind of scraping by growing up and

### 从底层到华尔街的崛起

>> 然后不知怎么地开始攀登**阶梯**，进入**华尔街**和**美国政治**的上层。我认为，关于爱泼斯坦早期生活信息的**缺失**，催生了**大量阴谋论**，从爱泼斯坦经营着一个**超级复杂的敲诈勒索行动**，到他与**情报部门**有关联。而从20世纪70年代中期到90年代初的这段时期，在很大程度上一直是一个**黑箱**。因此，我们几个月前开始报道时，目标就是试图**进入这个黑箱**，弄清楚爱泼斯坦是如何**起步**的。他之所以能做到这一点，**根本原因**在于他是一个**极其成功的骗子**。他**偷窃**、**欺骗**、**操纵**，并且一次又一次地发现，他可以**逍遥法外**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> then somehow starts to climb this ladder which will bring him to the upper echelons of Wall Street and American politics. And I think the absence of information about Epstein and his early years has given rise to just a vast number of conspiracy theories ranging from that Epstein was running this super sophisticated blackmail operation to that he was affiliated with intelligence services. And the period from basically the mid 1970s to the early 1990s for the most part has been just a complete black box. And so our goal when we started reporting on this months ago was to try and get inside that black box and figure out how Epstein got his start. And the bottom line of how he did that was that he was an extremely successful con man. He stole, he deceived, he manipulated, and he learned over and over again that he could do so basically with impunity.

</details>

### 华尔街的敲门砖

>> 那么，故事从哪里开始呢？>> 从1976年开始。爱泼斯坦是曼哈顿**道尔顿学校**的一名**教师**，他被邀请参加一个**画廊**的招待会，他有些**不情愿**地去了。在招待会上，他遇到了一位他学生的**家长**，这位家长对他的**数学能力**印象深刻。这位家长建议他可能在浪费时间当老师，而应该考虑**华尔街**的职业。然后，这位家长将爱泼斯坦介绍给了一个名叫**艾斯·格林伯格**的人。>> 一个非常响亮的名字。>> 是的，当时他是**所罗门兄弟公司**（Bear Stearns）的一位**高管**，这是一家**充满活力**的华尔街投资银行。它充满活力的一个方面是，它**不招聘常春藤盟校的MBA**。它寻找的是艾斯·格林伯格所说的**PSDs**，意思是**贫穷、聪明且极度渴望致富**的人。>> 哇。>> 爱泼斯坦去见了格林伯格进行**面试**。他**完全符合**要求。格林伯格被他的**魅力**、**风度**和**出色的数学能力**所折服，并给了他一份工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> So where does the story begin? >> It begins in 1976. Epstein is a teacher at the Dalton School in Manhattan and he gets invited to a reception at an art gallery and he goes kind of grudgingly in his tongue and at the reception he bumps into the parent of one of his students who is impressed with his math chops. And the parent suggests that maybe he is wasting his time being a teacher and instead should consider a career in Wall Street. And the parent then introduces Epstein to a guy named Ace Greenberg. >> Very big name. >> Yeah. who at the time was a top executive at Bear Sterns, which is this scrappy Wall Street investment bank. And one of the ways in which it's scrappy is that it is not going to hire Ivy League MBAs. It is looking for what Ace Greenberg likes to call PSDs, which stands for poor, smart, and deeply desirous of being rich. >> Wow. >> And Epste goes in to meet Greenberg for a job interview. And Epste fits the bill. Greenberg is bowled over by the guy's charisma and charm. and apparent math prowess and offers him a job.

</details>

### 职场初探与谎言的代价

于是，他来到了**所罗门兄弟公司**，并迅速成为公司一些**高管**的**门徒**。其中一位是格林伯格，也就是雇佣他的人，他对爱泼斯坦非常看重，甚至将他介绍给了自己**20岁的女儿**，他们开始约会，这为爱泼斯坦在公司内提供了某种程度的**保护伞**。这很快就派上了用场，因为在他加入**所罗门兄弟公司**几个月后，爱泼斯坦的上司——一位名叫**迈克尔·特南鲍姆**的人——从**人力资源部**得知，爱泼斯坦在**简历**中**谎报**了自己**大学毕业**的情况。>> 于是特南鲍姆把爱泼斯坦叫进办公室，他不太确定该如何处理这件事，因为你知道，这是一个**非常严重的违规行为**。另一方面，这家伙正在和老板的女儿约会，他**质问**了爱泼斯坦，**期望**爱泼斯坦会撒谎、狡辩或否认，那样特南鲍姆就可以轻易地**解雇**他。然而，爱泼斯坦却说：“**你说得对。是真的。我撒了谎。**”爱泼斯坦接着解释说，他撒谎的原因是，如果他不撒谎，像**所罗门兄弟公司**这样的公司，或者任何其他公司，**都不会**在他没有大学文凭的情况下给他一个**机会**。特南鲍姆被这种**坦诚**弄得措手不及，**打消了疑虑**，决定给爱泼斯坦一个**第二次机会**。这是一种我们将会**反复看到**的模式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So he arrives at Bear Sterns and he quickly becomes the protege to some of the firm's top executives. One is Greenberg, the guy who hired him, who is so taken with Epstein that he introduces him to his own 20-year-old daughter, and they start dating, which affords Epstein something akin to protected status at the firm. And that really quickly comes in handy because within a couple of months of his arrival at Beer Sterns, Epstein's boss, a guy named Michael Tenenbomb, learns from the HR department that Epstein had lied on his resume about having graduated from college. >> And so Tenbomb summons Epste into his office, is not really sure what to do about this because, you know, this is a very serious infraction. On the other hand, the guy is dating the boss's daughter and confronts Epstein with this, expecting Epstein to lie and dissemble and deny, which in that case would allow Tennibomb to easily fire him. Instead, Epstein says, "You're right. It's true. I did lie." And the reason he lied, Epstein goes on to say, is that if he didn't lie, there is no way a firm like Beer Sterns or anyone else is going to give him a chance without having a college diploma. And Tenbomb is so taken aback and disarmed by this honesty that he decides to give Epstein a second chance. And this is a pattern we will see repeating over and over and over again.

</details>

### 操纵与伪装的技巧

>> 这有点令人难以置信，因为首先，他以一种方式得到了这份工作，即**艾斯·格林伯格**似乎对他的**工人阶级背景**有一种**猎奇心理**，对吧？对别人来说可能是劣势的东西，对爱泼斯坦来说却成了**优势**。他得以**敲开了门**。然后，当他被**抓包**时，他不仅没有让自己显得可怜，反而把自己塑造成了他工作机构的**受害者**，对吧？比如“我别无选择只能撒谎，否则你们这些**强大**的**华尔街银行**永远不会给我机会。”>> 是的。而且，你知道，这已经是**40或45年前**的事了。当我采访特南鲍姆时，他仍然对爱泼斯坦**洞察人性的能力**感到**惊叹**，他认为爱泼斯坦能**瞬间**就明白，什么事情最有可能让他获得**第二次机会**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> It's sort of remarkable because first of all, he gets this job because in a way Ace Greenberg is like fetishizing his lower middle class background, right? Something that would have been a disadvantage to somebody else is an advantage to Epstein. He gets his foot in the door. And then when he gets caught, he doesn't just make himself sympathetic. He actually makes himself a victim of the institution where he's working, right? Like I had no choice but to lie. Otherwise, you big powerful mean Wall Street bank would never have taken a chance on me. >> Yeah. And to tennbomb, you know, this is now what 40 or 45 years later. When I spoke to him, he was still kind of marveling at Epstein's knack for understanding human dynamics so well that just on the spur of the moment, he understood that that would be something that was likely to get him a second chance.

</details>

### 职场晋升与滥用职权

>> 果然，这奏效了。>> 他保住了工作，并开始在**所罗门兄弟公司**的** ranks**中迅速**攀升**。几年之内，他被任命为**有限合伙人**，这意味着他当时能获得**巨额报酬**。大约相当于今天的**80万美元**。然而，**问题**依然层出不穷。比如，爱泼斯坦被发现**滥用**了他的**报销额度**。他去**加勒比海**出差，却为他的**女朋友**在**所罗门兄弟公司**报销了大约**1万美元**的**珠宝和服装费**。是的，这是在他约会老板女儿之后。>> 嗯。另一件事是，他一直在帮助他的**女朋友****提前获得**所罗门兄弟公司**的**有利可图的投资机会**，这无疑违反了公司的**规定**，甚至可能触犯**法律**。他还帮助他的**高中朋友**在**所罗门兄弟公司**获得**贷款**购买**证券**，这也违反了公司**政策**，甚至可能触犯**法律**。最终，**所罗门兄弟公司**得知此事并开始**调查**。爱泼斯坦很可能只是受到**轻微处罚**，他可能会被处以**罚款**并被**停职几个月**。但他不愿忍受这种**屈辱**，于是他选择**辞职**，声称自己对被调查感到**深受冒犯**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> And sure enough, it worked. >> So what happens next? >> Well, he keeps his job and he starts very quickly climbing through the ranks at Bear Sterns. Within a few years, he has been named a limited partner, which means that he is getting paid boatloads of money at that point. Something like $800,000 in today's dollars. And yet, the problems still keep bubbling up. I mean, Epstein was found to abuse his expense account. He took a work trip to the Caribbean and charged Beer Sterns something like $10,000 on jewelry and clothing for his girlfriend. So, this is after he was dating the boss's daughter. >> Mhm. Another thing is that it turns out that he has been helping his girlfriend get early access to lucrative investment deals at Bear Sterns, which is a violation certainly of the company's rules if not the law. And he's helping his high school friend get a loan to buy securities at Bear Sterns, which is also a violation of company policies if not the law. And eventually Beer Sterns gets wind of this and starts investigating. And Epstein is kind of headed for a slap on the wrist. he's likely to get uh pay a financial penalty and also be suspended for a couple of months. And instead of suffering that indignity, he decides to resign, saying that he's been deeply offended by the fact that he was even being investigated.

</details>

### 学习上流社会的生存之道

所以，他在**所罗门兄弟公司**通过他建立的**人脉和同事网络**，学到了很多东西，其中最重要的是如何**像一个真正富有的人一样行事和举止**。>> 这是关于用哪种叉子吃饭，还是关于**表现得自在**，或者在压力下**表现出轻松**？>> 两者都有。包括用哪种叉子。如何**得体着装**，如何向**皇室成员**或**高级政客**介绍自己，但更重要的是，要拥有**自信**，相信自己**属于**这些场合，属于这些与**富人和权贵**同在的**房间**。这对他的**事业**立即带来了**回报**。一位**前所罗门兄弟公司**的同事将他介绍给一位名叫**迈克尔·斯特罗尔**的人，他是一位**视频游戏高管**。爱泼斯坦说服斯特罗尔给了他**45万美元**，这大约是斯特罗尔**净资产的10%**，用于投资爱泼斯坦声称的**石油项目**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So, one of the many things he learned at Bear Sterns through this network of acquaintances and colleagues that he built up was basically how to act and behave as a really rich person. >> Is this like which fork to use or is this about acting comfortable or giving off an air of ease in the face of >> It's both. It is what fork to use. It's how to dress appropriately, how to introduce yourself to a member of royalty or to a senior politician, but it's also to have the confidence that he belongs in these settings, in these rooms with rich and powerful people. And that immediately pays dividends for him. A former Bear Sterns colleague introduces him to a guy named Michael Stroll, who is a video game executive, and Epstein persuades Stroll to hand him $450,000, which is about 10% of Stroll's net worth, to invest in what Epste claims is an oil deal.

</details>

### 首次“大捞一笔”与逍遥法外

>> **没有证据表明**任何石油项目存在。斯特罗尔**损失了几乎所有的钱**，并不断纠缠爱泼斯坦，说：“我的钱在哪里？你答应过我会得到这样的回报。”爱泼斯坦**一次又一次地拒绝**他。有一次，他甚至寄给斯特罗尔一**品脱的原油**，试图说服他石油项目确实存在。>> 但最终，钱就这么**消失了**。所以，这是爱泼斯坦的**第一次重大‘捞金’**。他带着似乎是**数十万美元**的、他**偷来的钱**离开了。而且**什么事都没有发生**。斯特罗尔起诉了他。官司在联邦法院系统里**拖了多年**。最终，爱泼斯坦在**技术层面获胜**。所以，爱泼斯坦现在是**两战两胜**。他在**所罗门兄弟公司****欺骗**和**撒谎**，基本上**逃脱了惩罚**。现在，他又与这位**视频游戏高管****欺骗**和**撒谎**，并**再次逍遥法外**。对于像爱泼斯坦这样的人来说，这传达的信息非常明确：如果你**足够好地**、**足够频繁地**撒谎和欺骗，并且**足够善于操纵**，你就可以靠这个**谋生**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> There's no evidence that any oil deal existed. And Stroll loses virtually all of his money and keeps pestering Epstein, saying, "Where is my money? you promised me we would get this kind of payout. Epstein rebuffs him over and over again. At one point sends him a pint of crude oil to convince him that the oil deal actually does exist. Wow. >> But the money is just gone ultimately. And so this is one of Epstein's huge first killings. He walks away with what appears to be several hundred,000 of money that he just stole from this guy. And nothing really happens. And Stroll files a lawsuit against him. It bounces around the federal court system for years. Ultimately, Epstein prevails on technical grounds. And so Epste is now two for two. He cheated and lied at Bear Sterns and essentially got away with it. Now he's cheating and lying with this video game executive and walking away with his money once again with impunity. And for someone like Epstein, the message there is very clear, which is that if you lie and cheat well enough and often enough and are sufficiently manipulative, you can make a real living doing this.

</details>

### 欺诈技能的进阶

>> 所以，他不仅学会了可以**逃脱惩罚**，而且听起来他是在**更大范围**内，并且与**可能属于他社交圈内的人**进行**逃脱**。>> 是的，没错。爱泼斯坦如果不是一个**非常擅长欺诈和盗窃的学生**，那他什么都不是。你可以看到他从一个阶段**进步**到下一个阶段，随着他**成功次数越多**，他变得越**有野心**，越**大胆**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> So, he's not only learning that he can get away with it, but it sounds like he's learning that he's getting away with it at a larger level and with people who are arguably within his social network. >> Yeah, that's right. And Epstein is nothing if not a very good student of fraud and thievery. And you can see him progressing from one stage of this to the next and getting more ambitious and bolder and bolder the more times he pulls this off and the more times he gets away with it.

</details>

### 金融寻宝人与新机遇

>> 他接下来去了哪里？>> 大约在这个时候，爱泼斯坦开始称自己为“**金融寻宝人**”，基本上就是那种**在全球范围内追踪隐藏资产**的人。碰巧，我们正处于**20世纪80年代初**。他当时正在和一个名叫**安娜·奥贝贡**的**西班牙女演员**约会。>> 结果，她的家人刚刚意识到，他们在一次**纽约证券公司的破产**中损失了**数百万美元**。于是，他们雇佣爱泼斯坦去**追回**他们丢失的钱。他与他的一位朋友——一位**前联邦检察官**——合作，两人花了**接下来的几年**试图追踪这些**失踪的资产**，结果**令人惊讶地**，他们**找到了**。这些钱在一个位于**开曼群岛**的**银行**里。>> 爱泼斯坦和他的伙伴**包了一架飞机**，飞往开曼群岛，并**设法带走了数百万美元**的这些**证券**。他们追回了资产，并作为**酬金**获得了一部分。所以，此时的爱泼斯坦**几乎肯定已经是个百万富翁**了，这对于几年前还只是一个**工人阶级**、试图当**高中老师**谋生的人来说，是一个**相当非凡的转变**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> So where does he go from here? >> So Epstein around this time has been referring to himself as a financial bounty hunter. basically someone who like tracks down hidden assets all over the world. And as it happens, we're in the kind of early 1980s at this point. He is dating a Spanish actress named Anna Obergon. >> And it turns out that her family has just realized that they've lost millions of dollars in the implosion of a securities firm in New York. And so they hire Epstein to track down their missing money. and he pairs up with a friend of his who's a former federal prosecutor and together they spend the next couple years trying to track down these missing assets and lo and behold they find them. They're in a bank in the Cayman Islands >> and Epstein and his buddy charter a jet go down to Cayman and somehow walk away with millions of dollars of these securities. They recover it and get paid a certain portion of that as a fee. And so Epstein by this point is almost certainly a millionaire, which is really it's a quite an extraordinary turnaround for a guy who just a few years earlier was this working-class guy trying to make a living as a high school teacher.

</details>

### 价值的体现与新的游戏规则

>> 然而，关于追回资金的故事也**非常有趣**，因为关于爱泼斯坦的**叙述**之一，尤其是在**近年**，是这个家伙**并非真正的金融天才**。这是你**反复听到**的事情。人们会问：为什么这些**亿万富翁**会把**数百万美元**交给他管理，而他并没有在任何方面证明自己**与众不同**？但这似乎是我所知的**唯一一个**他真正为人们提供**切实价值**的故事，而且这种价值似乎**相当独特**。>> 是的。坦白说，这也是我在报道这个故事和理解这个故事时**略感挣扎**的地方，因为爱泼斯坦喜欢将自己塑造成一个**金融天才**。我们**没有看到证据**支持这一说法。但在这里，我们确实看到了一些**精明之处**，这些确实让他**脱颖而出**。因此，大约在这个时候，爱泼斯坦已经**积累了足够的财富**，他从当初被**所罗门兄弟公司****扫地出门**，到现在他**重返所罗门兄弟公司**，这次是以一个**尊贵的客户**身份。他通过这家公司进行了**大量交易**，为**所罗门兄弟公司**带来了**收入**，这使得**所罗门兄弟公司**非常**乐意**维持与他的良好关系。于是，他们开始向他提供一些**便利**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> The story of the recovered money though is also so interesting because one of the narratives about Epstein in recent years in recent memory is that this guy was not actually a financial genius. That's the thing you get you you hear over and over again. And people are like, why would would these billionaires hand him millions of dollars to manage when he wasn't proving himself as singular in any particular way? But this is the only story I think I am familiar with where he really provides tangible value to people in a way that does seem quite singular, >> right? And to be frank, it's one of the things I've struggled with a little bit in reporting the story and in understanding the story because Epstein, he likes to present himself as this financial genius. We have not seen evidence to support that claim. We do see here some glimmer of cleverness that does set him apart. And so around this time, Epstein has amassed enough money that he has gone from having been kind of chased out of Beer Sterns with his tail between his legs to now he returns to Beer Sterns this time as a valued client. He's doing lots of trading through the firm which produces revenue for Bear Sterns which makes Bear Sterns very eager to keep him in its good graces. And so they start extending some favors to him.

### 利用女性作为筹码

>> 便利，比如什么？>> 嗯，爱泼斯坦在公司的**前经理**之一，现在负责**作为客户**管理他，他有一位非常**有魅力的年轻女助理**，名叫**帕特里夏·施密特**。1987年的一天晚上，这位经理让施密特晚上去爱泼斯坦的公寓**送文件**。施密特去了公寓。爱泼斯坦给她泡了茶，带她参观了他**非常漂亮的公寓楼**，并邀请她**随时回来使用楼里的游泳池**。施密特接受了他的邀请。于是，两人开始了一段**长达一年的性关系**。我们在报道中发现，这位**同一位所罗门兄弟公司**的经理在**其他多个场合**也曾将**年轻的女助理**送到爱泼斯坦的公寓，这些都**最终导致了性关系**。爱泼斯坦似乎意识到，如果**所罗门兄弟公司**可以**利用女性作为筹码**，那么他也可以。施密特在接受我采访时，她对自己的**角色**非常**清醒**，她知道自己被**利用**了。她向我描述道，她是他**的玩物**，而爱泼斯坦则认为她是一个能**帮助他实现目标**的人。果然，我们看到他开始**利用施密特做其他事情**，比如让施密特**带领他的客户和熟人参观华尔街**，带他们去**所罗门兄弟公司**，也许还会带他们去**享用一顿美餐**。因此，爱泼斯坦发现，**有魅力的年轻女性**是他用来**打动和培养关系**的**有力货币**，以与他想做生意的**富裕且有权势的人**建立联系。

>> Favors like what? >> Well, one of Epste's former managers at the firm who is now helping to run him as a client has a very attractive young assistant named Patricia Schmidt. And one night in 1987, the manager asks Schmidt to deliver some papers to Epstein's apartment at night. And Schmidt goes over to the apartment. Epstein makes her tea, gives her a tour of his very nice apartment building, and invites her to come back whenever she wants to use the building's swimming pool. And Schmidt takes him up on that offer. And thus begins a year-long sexual relationship between Schmidt and Epstein. And one of the things we found in our reporting is that the same Bear Stern's manager on multiple other occasions also sent young female assistants over to Epstein's apartment and that ended up leading to sexual relationships. And Epste seems to realize that if Bear Sterns can use women as a source of leverage, so can he. And Schmidt, when I spoke with her, she was very cleareyed about her role in this and that she was being used. And the way she described it to me was that I was his play thing and Epstein perceived her as someone that's going to help him get where he wants to go. And sure enough, we see him start to use Schmidt for other things such as he would have Schmidt give his clients and acquaintances tours around Wall Street, bringing them into Bear Sterns, maybe take them out to a nice dinner. And so Epstein had discovered that he could use attractive young women was a potent form of currency as he sought to impress and cultivate relationships with rich and powerful people whom he wanted to do business with.

### 权势网络与“名流圈”的形成

>> 他利用了别人被**性**所驱动的**动机**，以及如果他为他们做些什么，他们可能会为他做些什么，也就是说，派这个女人去和他们**会面**。据我们所知，这可能是爱泼斯坦**首次**真正**完全发现**他可以利用**女性**来**推进自己的议程**。与此同时，大约在这个时候，爱泼斯坦也**积累了足够多的人脉**并**建立了足够的财富**，这些因素开始**相互叠加**。在接下来的十年里，我们将看到爱泼斯坦将这一切**推向了新的高度**，开始与**美国金融界和社会的精英**建立联系。他将与**大卫·洛克菲勒**、零售巨头**莱斯·韦克斯纳**，以及最终像**摩根大通**这样的大型机构和银行建立并**利用**这些关系。这就是我们现在都认识的爱泼斯坦，对吧？他建立了一个**庞大的网络**，不仅包括他**虐待的年轻女性和女孩**，还包括一群**富裕、有权势、有名的男性**，他们一路以来都在**支持和纵容**他。

>> He's taking advantage of the fact that other people are motivated by sex and they might do something for him if he does something for them, i.e. send this woman out to meetings with them. As far as we can tell, this is probably the first time that Epstein has really fully discovered his ability to use women to really advance his own agenda. And at the same time around now, Epstein has also really cultivated enough connections and built enough wealth that those things start compounding upon each other. And we will see over the ensuing decade that Epstein really takes that to the next level and starts building connections with kind of the creme de la creme of American finance and society. And so he'll build and exploit relationships with people like David Rockefeller, like Les Wexner, the retail tycoon, ultimately with big institutions and big banks like JP Morgan. And this is the Epstein who we all now know, right? is someone who has built this huge network not only of young women and girls whom he's abusing but also this cast of rich, powerful, famous men who have supported him and enabled him along the way.

### 特朗普与爱泼斯坦的关系

>> 我们稍后回来。>> 那么，大卫，你描述了爱泼斯坦在他**早期**学到的许多**教训**，这些教训帮助他**攀登社会阶梯**，积累了**巨额财富**，当然也**助长了他多年来犯罪活动**。但你没有提到一个名字：**唐纳德·特朗普**。正是对总统的**施压**才导致了这些文件的披露，因为人们想了解**政府掌握**了哪些关于杰弗里·爱泼斯坦及其**犯罪行为**以及他所处的**网络**的**证据**。所以，我想知道，我们该如何看待**唐纳德·特朗普**在爱泼斯坦的**早期**扮演的角色？>> 嗯，爱泼斯坦和特朗普在**多年**里都在**非常相似的社交圈**中活动，基本上从**20世纪80年代末**到**21世纪初**。他们有时似乎是**非常亲密的朋友**。我们的同事**尼克·孔费索里**花了数月时间深入调查此事。他的调查发现，他们不仅**多年来是亲密的朋友**，而且他们还曾**争夺年轻女性**。尼克在他的报道中描述爱泼斯坦和特朗普是彼此的“**僚机**”（wingmen）。即便如此，关于他们关系的**确切性质**仍有**许多未解之谜**。例如，他们之间是否存在**商业往来**？我**不清楚**这些**尚未披露**的爱泼斯坦文件中是否存在答案，而这些文件正被**特朗普政府**掌握着。我们可以这样理解：**司法部**被告知并**依法要求**发布的是与爱泼斯坦**多年来**的**联邦调查**相关的文件。我不清楚联邦调查人员是否对爱泼斯坦**交往过的男性**进行了**大量调查**，无论是特朗普，还是像**莱昂·布莱克**、**莱斯·韦克斯纳**这样的人。因此，如果这些人**不是调查对象**，我们不太可能在这些文件中看到关于他们的**大量信息**。但同时，也有一个问题是，特朗普及其政府**究竟为何**如此**不愿**坦诚公布这些文件中的内容？如果他们**年初就按计划发布了**这些文件，我们可能**就不会**再谈论这件事了。而他们**如此极力地**反对**完全透明**，这确实表明其中**隐藏着一些他们不想公开的东西**。

>> We'll be right back. So David, you've described a lot of the lessons that Epstein learned in his early years that allowed him to climb his way up the social ladder, that allowed him to amass great wealth, and of course enabled his criminal activity over many, many years. But one name that you have not mentioned is Donald Trump. and pressure on the president is what led to the disclosure of these files because people want to understand what evidence the government has about Jeffrey Epstein and his criminal behavior and the network in which he operated. And so I wonder then how are we to think about where Donald Trump fits into Epstein's early years? >> Well, Epstein and Trump were operating in very similar social circles for a number of years. basically from the late 1980s into the early 2000s. They were at times apparently very close friends. And our colleague Nick Confesori has just spent months digging into this. And one of the findings in his investigation was that not only were they close friends for years, but they were also competing with each other for young women. And Nick and his story described Epstein and Trump as being one another's wingmen. That being said, there are still a lot of unanswered questions about the exact nature of that relationship. If there were business dealings between the two of them, for example, and it is not clear to me whether there are answers that are lurking in these as yet undisclosed Epstein files that the Trump administration is sitting on. And one way to think about this is that at the outset, what the Justice Department has been told and is required under law to release are files related to the federal investigations of Epstein over the years. And it is not clear to me that federal investigators were doing a whole lot of investigating into the men with whom Epstein was associated, whether that's Trump or men like Leon Black or Les Wexner or people like that. And so to the extent that those were not subjects of investigation, we're not likely to see a tremendous amount about them in these files. But at the same time, there's also a question of why exactly Trump and his administration have been so reluctant to come clean about what is in these files to begin with. And if they had just released this stuff when they said they would back early in this year, we might not be talking about this anymore. or in the fact that they have been fighting so hard against full transparency here, it does suggest that there is something in there that they want to hide.

### 证据与调查的困惑

>> 但同时，我一直不太明白的一件事是关于所谓的“**爱泼斯坦文件**”，如果**司法部**多年来，跨越多个政府时期，掌握了关于特朗普或任何其他**知名人士**的**犯罪行为证据**，那么为什么会这样呢？所以，我不想显得**天真**地说，如果**司法部**有犯罪证据，为什么他们不调查？但我就是**不太理解**，为什么我们认为这些信息**不会早点浮出水面**。>> 这并非不言自明，至少有两个原因可能导致这种情况没有发生。一个原因是，我认为，人们普遍接受的**传统观念**是，如果一个政府掌握了关于其**政治对手**的**不利信息**，这些信息会**立即被公布**。但这并非**司法部门****历来**的运作方式。因此，**前任政府的司法部门**可能掌握了关于其**对手**的**不利信息**，但为了**保密**而将其**雪藏**。这是第一点。第二点是，也完全有可能存在一些**报告**、**怀疑**或**调查线索**，这些线索**指向了有权势的人物和机构**，但这些调查**最终一无所获**。也许是因为**缺乏证据**，但也可能是因为**联邦调查人员****长期以来**都不**积极追查**涉及**白领犯罪**的案件。当你面对的是**世界上最富有、最有权势的人**时，他们**可能逃脱惩罚**，这**并不令人惊讶**，也**不是阴谋论**。

<details>

>> But at the same time, one of the things I've never quite understood about the Epstein files, as we have been calling them, is if there was evidence of criminal behavior on the part of Trump or any of these other notable figures that has been in the possession of the DOJ across multiple administrations for years. And so I don't mean to come off as naive and say like if the DOJ had evidence of crimes, why would they not investigate it? But I I just don't quite understand why exactly we believe that it wouldn't have come out before now. >> It's not self-evident that this would have already come out for at least two reasons. One reason is that, you know, it's become, I think, accepted conventional wisdom that if an administration has damaging information about its political enemies that that will immediately be released. That is not the way. justice departments have historically operated. And so it's entirely possible that a previous administration's justice department might have had damaging information about its opponents that it kept under wraps because it was supposed to do so. That's thing one. Thing two is that it is also entirely possible that there could have been reports or suspicions or investigative trails that were followed that did lead to powerful men and powerful institutions and those investigations went nowhere. Maybe because there wasn't evidence, but also it could be because there's a a long history of federal investigators not aggressively pursuing cases that involve white collar defendants. When you have some of the richest, most powerful people in the world, it is not surprising and it's not a conspiracy to think that those people might get away with it.

### 期待与现实的落差

>> 我想我之所以**纠结**于这一点，是因为感觉**每个人都在等待另一只靴子落下**。每个人都**屏息以待**，想看看这些文件里有什么，也许这些文件最终会回答我们关于爱泼斯坦**圈子**和**唐纳德·特朗普**的**持续疑问**。但感觉**浮现出的画面**，至少从你的报道来看，是我们**已经大致知道了答案**——关于爱泼斯坦是如何成为爱泼斯坦的，某种程度上，他**不需要**成为一个**秘密特工**或其他**阴谋论**所暗示的那样。他只需要成为一个**极其精明的人**，并且**很早就学会了**他可以**操纵他人**，可以**犯罪**，并且可以**为所欲为**地**一路攀升**。>> 是的，我认为你说得对。而且我认为有很多**非常好的报道**已经**层层剥开了**爱泼斯坦故事的**许多层面**。我确实认为还有**很多层面**有待揭示。而且我**并不抱太大希望**，认为这些文件在发布过程中会**揭示太多**。>> 但我认为仍然有**大量重要的问题****尚未得到解答**。我认为爱泼斯坦的**传奇故事**多年来一直是一个**政治的试金石**，左翼人士将其视为**攻击唐纳德·特朗普的武器**。我认为右翼人士将其视为**攻击**所谓的**自由派全球主义机构和个人**的**工具**。我认为**真相**可能**介于两者之间**，对吧？有很多**非常富有且有权势的男性****纵容**了爱泼斯坦，并且可能**参与**了他的**一些罪行**。我认为**至今**对这些男性**鲜有问责**。而且我认为我们**尚未完全了解**这些**政府文件**中可能包含或不包含关于这些男性的信息。但人们认为可能还有**更多内幕**，部分原因是他们**希望政治对手被爱泼斯坦丑闻摧毁的梦想**仍未实现。但部分原因也是认识到，有**如此多的人**参与**支持**爱泼斯坦并**允许他的犯罪网络繁荣**，以至于只**有两个人**——杰弗里·爱泼斯坦和他**的同伙** **吉斯兰·麦克斯韦尔**——**迄今为止**真正**承担了责任**，这**感觉不对**。

>> I guess the reason why I'm sort of lingering on this is that it feels like everybody is waiting for another shoe to drop. Everyone is waiting with baited breath to see what's in these files and maybe these files will finally answer our persistent questions about Epstein's orbit and Donald Trump. But it feels like the picture that's emerging, at least from your reporting, is that we already kind of know the answer about how Epstein became Epstein in some way, which is that he didn't need to be a secret spy or whatever these other conspiracy theories that have popped up in intervening years would suggest. He just needed to be a remarkably savvy guy who learned very early on that he could manipulate people. He could commit crimes and he could basically get away with anything he wanted as he climbed up the ladder. >> Yeah, I think that's right. And I think there's been a lot of really good reporting that has peeled back a lot of layers of the Epstein story. I do think that there are still a bunch of layers left to unpeel. And I'm not holding out a huge degree of confidence that these files as they get released are going to do much of that peeling, >> but I do think there is still a ton of important questions that have not been answered. And I think the Epstein saga for years now has been kind of a political roar test and that people on the left or many people on the left view it as a weapon with which to go after Donald Trump. I think on the right a lot of people view this as a vehicle to attack kind of liberal globalist institutions and individuals. And I think the truth is probably somewhere in the middle, right? That there are a lot of very rich powerful men who enabled Epstein and may have participated in some of his crimes. I do not think that there has been very much accountability for those men yet. And I don't think that we have a full sense of what information may or may not be in these government files pertaining to those men. But I think the reason people think that there may be more shoes to drop, it's partly that their dreams of having their political enemies crushed by the Epstein scandal remain unfulfilled. But it's also partly of recognition that there were so many people involved in supporting Epstein and allowing his criminal network to prosper >> that it just doesn't feel right that only two people, Jeffrey Epste and his associate Gain Maxwell have really been held to account for this so far.

### 责任与警示

>> 好的，但说到承担责任，我确实想知道这是否是这里的**启示**。因为一方面，显然杰弗里·爱泼斯坦死在了**牢房**里。另一方面，他**逃脱了可怕的罪行**，并且**积累了如此多的财富和权力**。我们一直在整个谈话中讨论爱泼斯坦为了做到这一点而学到的**教训**，但我确实想知道，作为公众，我们应该从爱泼斯坦的故事以及他**最终的结局**中学到什么？>> 好了，看看，死在**牢房**里**不是任何人**的**幸福结局**。话虽如此，爱泼斯坦的故事**确实是关于‘有罪不罚’**的，而且正如你所说，尽管有**反复出现的危险信号**、**无数警告**以及**许多受害者站出来**试图揭发他，他却**多年来一直逍遥法外**。对我来说，这**也是一个更广泛的‘有罪不罚’的故事**。不仅仅是关于杰弗里·爱泼斯坦，还有他**身边的人**，其中许多人**实际上并未公开面对**他们在其中扮演的**角色**。人们之所以在很大程度上仍然**痴迷于**爱泼斯坦，我认为是因为**有太多的人****尚未经历类似的公开审判**。所以，对我来说，这就是**最大的启示**：对于那些拥有**大量金钱、权力和人脉**的人来说，他们**确实可以‘有罪不罚’地行事**。

>> Okay, but speaking of being held accountable, I do wonder if that's the takeaway here because on the one hand, obviously Jeffrey Epstein died in a jail cell. On the other hand, he got away with horrific crimes and amassed so much money and power over the years. We've been talking this whole conversation about the lessons that Epstein learned in order to do that, but I do wonder what lessons we as the public should learn looking at Epstein's story and how he came to an end. Well, look, dying in a jail cell is no one's idea of a happy ending. That said, the story of Epstein is really one of impunity, and he, as you said, got away with this for years, despite repeated red flags, despite many warnings, despite many victims coming forward and trying to blow the whistle on him. And to me, it's also a broader story of impunity. Not just about Jeffrey Epstein, but the people around him, many of whom really have not had a public reckoning about the roles they play in this. The reason that people remain obsessed about Epstein to a large degree, I think, is that there are so many people out there who have not had a similar public reckoning. And so to me, that's the great takeaway that for people with a lot of money and power and connections, they really can act with impunity.

### 最新文件与特朗普的关联

>> 大卫·恩里奇，非常感谢你。>> 谢谢。>> 周一深夜，**司法部**发布了更多与杰弗里·爱泼斯坦**调查**相关的**文件**。这些文件包含**数百处**提及**特朗普总统**的内容，尽管其中大部分来自**媒体报道**、**未经证实的消息**以及**调查人员之间的讨论**，包括提到特朗普在1993年至1996年间**八次**乘坐爱泼斯坦的**私人飞机**。但**没有一处提及**似乎能证明**不当行为**。>> 我们稍后回来。>> 以下是您今天需要了解的其他信息。特朗普总统周一宣布，**海军**将建造两艘新的“**特朗普级**”战列舰，最终目标是拥有25艘。此举是总统将联邦政府的某个方面**以其形象重新命名**的最新例子。此公告还伴随着美国**升级了对委内瑞拉总统尼古拉斯·马杜罗的威胁**，并**拦截了服务于该国石油行业的油轮**。在一项引起**资深记者批评**的举动中，**CBS新闻**在**新主管**巴里·韦斯表示该片段需要**进一步报道**后，**突然从《60分钟》节目中删除了**一个关于萨尔瓦多臭名昭著的**SECOT监狱**的片段。此决定在**网络内外**都引起了**谴责**，批评者认为此举证明了该网络**与其维护新闻诚信相比**，更**倾向于迎合特朗普政府**。

>> David Enrich, thank you so much. >> Thanks for having me. >> Late on Monday night, the Department of Justice released more files related to the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. The documents contained hundreds of references to President Trump, although most of them are from media reports, unverified tips, and discussions among investigators, including a mention that Trump was a passenger on Epstein's private jet eight times between 1993 and 1996. None of the mentions appear to be evidence of wrongdoing. We'll be right back. Here's what else you need to know today. President Trump announced on Monday that the Navy would build two new quote Trump class battleships with the eventual goal of acquiring 25. The move was the latest example of the president rebranding an aspect of the federal government in his image. The announcement also comes as the US has ratcheted up its threats against Venezuela's President Nicholas Maduro and intercepted tankers that serve the country's oil industry. And in a move that prompted criticism from a veteran correspondent, CBS News abruptly removed a segment about El Salvador's notorious SECOT prison from an episode of 60 Minutes after the network's new chief, Barry Weiss, said the segment needed additional reporting. The decision drew condemnation inside and outside the network where critics of Weiss saw the move as evidence that the network was more interested in cowtowing to the Trump administration than preserving its journalistic integrity.
