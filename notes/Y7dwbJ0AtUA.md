### AI产品形态的演变与未来

我认为我们尚未知晓最终产品的形态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think we don't yet know the shape and form of the ultimate products.</p>
</details>

一个显而易见的历史类比是，从1975年个人电脑发明到1992年，它基本上是一个**文本提示系统**（Text Prompt System: 用户通过输入文本指令与计算机交互的界面）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just one just obvious historical analogy is you know the personal computer from sort of invention in 1975 through to you know basically 1992 was a text prompt system.</p>
</details>

17年后，整个行业转向了**图形用户界面**（GUI: Graphical User Interface: 通过图标、菜单等图形方式操作计算机的界面），并且再也没有回头。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">17 years in you know the whole industry took a left turn into gooies and never looked back.</p>
</details>

顺便说一句，五年后，行业又转向了网页浏览器，也再没有回头。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then by the way you know 5 years after that the industry took a left turn into web browsers and never looked back right.</p>
</details>

我相信20年后仍然会有聊天机器人，但我相当确信，无论是当前的聊天机器人公司还是许多新公司，都将开发出许多截然不同、我们甚至尚未知晓的用户体验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know look I'm I'm sure there will be chat bots 20 years from now but I'm pretty confident that both the current chatbot companies and many new companies are going to figure out many kinds of user experiences that are radically different that we don't we don't even know.</p>

### 大型语言模型（LLM）的智能与创造力

**Eric Torberg:** Marc，最近有很多关于**大型语言模型**（LLM: Large Language Model: 基于深度学习，能理解和生成人类语言的人工智能模型）局限性的讨论，比如它们无法真正发明新的科学，无法展现真正的创造性天赋，而只是组合或包装现有信息。你对此有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mark, there's been a lot of talk lately about the limitations of LLMs that they they can't do true invention of say new science that they can't do true creative genius that it's just combining or packaging. You have thoughts here. What say you?</p>
</details>

**Marc Andreessen:** 是的，对于我来说，你总会遇到这些问题，它们通常会以两种形式出现：一是语言模型是否智能，即它们能否像人类一样真正处理信息并实现概念上的突破；二是语言模型或视频模型是否具有创造力，即它们能否创造新的艺术，真正实现创造性突破。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, so for me, yes, you get all these questions and yeah, they usually come in either, you know, sort of are are language models intelligent in the sense of like can they actually um you know, can they actually process information and have sort of conceptual breakthroughs? the way that people can. And then there's are language models or or video models creative, you know, can they can they create new art? Um actually have genuine creative breakthroughs.</p>
</details>

当然，我对这两个问题的回答是：人类能做到这些吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And of course my my my answer to both of those is well can people do those things?</p>
</details>

我认为这里有两个问题：即使有些人“智能”，能够有原创的概念性突破，而不是仅仅重复训练集或遵循脚本，那么有多少比例的人能做到这一点？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and um I think there's two two two questions there which is like okay even if some people are quote unquote intelligent as in having original uh conceptual breakthroughs and not just let's just say regurgitating the training set um uh or following scripts um uh how you know what percentage of people can actually do that and I say I've only met a few some of them are here in the room um but uh you know not that many most people never do.</p>
</details>

我可以说我只见过少数几个人能做到，其中一些就在这个房间里，但并不多，大多数人从未做到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I say I've only met a few some of them are here in the room um but uh you know not that many most people never do.</p>
</details>

至于创造力，真正具有创造力的人有多少呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then creativity I mean how many people are actually genuinely creative right?</p>
</details>

你会指向一个贝多芬或梵高，然后说：“好的，那是创造力。”是的，那是创造力，但有多少个贝多芬和梵高呢？显然不多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so you you kind of point to a Beethoven or you know Van Gogh or something like that you're like Okay, that's creativity and yeah, that's creativity and then how many Beethovenas and Van Go are there? Obviously, not very many.</p>
</details>

所以，一方面，如果这些事物能够达到99.99%人类的水平，那本身就相当有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, so one is just like okay, like you know, if it's if it if if if these things clear the bar of, you know, 99.99% of humanity, you know, then that's pretty interesting just in and of itself.</p>
</details>

但当你深入挖掘时，你会发现，与思想的“混搭”相比，人类历史上真正概念上的突破实际上有多少？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But then I you dig into it further and you're like, okay, like how many actual real conceptual breakthroughs have there ever ever been actually ever in human history as compared to sort of remixing remixing ideas.</p>
</details>

如果你审视技术史，几乎总是如此：重大的突破是至少40年，也就是四个十年努力的结果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and you know like if you look at the history of technology it's almost always the case that the big breakthroughs are the result of you know usually at least 40 years of sort of work ahead of time you know four decades right.</p>
</details>

事实上，语言模型本身就是八十年先前工作的结晶。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In fact language models themselves are the culmination of eight decades right of previous work.</p>
</details>

所以，存在着“混搭”，艺术领域也是如此。小说、音乐等，显然存在创造性飞跃，但其中包含了大量来自前人的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so there's remixing and then in the arts it's the exact same thing you know novels and music and everything like you know there are clearly creative leaps but you know there's just tremendous amounts of influence that came in from from people who came before.</p>
</details>

即使你想到像贝多芬这样有创造力的人，莫扎特和海顿以及他之前的作曲家身上也有很多贝多芬的影子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And even if you think about like somebody with the creativity of a Beethoven like there There's a lot of Beethoven in Mozart and Heiden and in the composers that came before.</p>
</details>

所以，存在着大量的“混搭”和组合。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so there's just tremendous amounts of of of remixing and combination.</p>
</details>

这有点像“针尖上跳舞的天使”问题，如果你能达到世界顶尖、世代相传的创造力或智能的0.001%水平，那你就差不多成功了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so it's it's it's a little bit of an angel's dancing on the head of a pin question which is like if you can get if you can get you know within you know I don't know one you know 001% of of kind of worldbeating uh you know generational creativity intelligence like you're you're you're probably all the way there.</p>
</details>

所以，情感上我希望人类的创造力仍然有其特殊之处，我当然相信这一点，我也非常希望相信这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I so emotionally I want to like hold out hope that there is you know still something special about human creativity and I I certainly believe that and I and I and I very much want to believe that.</p>
</details>

但是，当我使用这些东西时，我会觉得它们似乎非常聪明，也非常有创造力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But um I don't know when I use these things I'm like wow they seem to be awfully smart and awfully creative.</p>
</details>

所以我相当确信它们会达到这个标准。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I'm I'm I'm I'm pretty convinced that they're going to clear the bar.</p>
</details>

**Eric Torberg:** 是的。这似乎是你分析中的一个共同主题，当人们谈论LLM的局限性时，比如它们能否进行**迁移学习**（Transfer Learning: 将在一个任务上学到的知识应用到另一个相关任务上）或一般的学习，你似乎会问：“人类能做到这一点吗？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. the I think that seems to be a common theme in your analysis when when people talk about the limitations of LMS, you know, can they do transfer learning or or just learning in general? You seem to ask, can people do this?</p>
</details>

**Marc Andreessen:** 是的，人类能做到这些吗？这就像**横向思维**（Lateral Thinking: 一种非线性的、创造性的问题解决方式），对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. Can people do these things? Well, it's like lateral thinking, right?</p>
</details>

所以，这就像在分布内或分布外进行推理，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, yeah, so it's like reasoning in or out of distribution, right?</p>
</details>

我认识很多人在分布内推理方面非常出色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so it's like, okay, I know a lot of people who are very good at reasoning inside distribution.</p>
</details>

我真正认识多少人擅长在分布外推理并进行迁移学习呢？答案是：我只认识少数几个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How many people do I actually know who are good at reasoning outside of distribution and doing transfer learning? And and the answer is like I know a handful.</p>
</details>

我认识一些人，每当你问他们一个问题，他们都会给出极其原创的答案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like I I know a few I know a few people um where whenever you ask them a question, you get an extremely original answer.</p>
</details>

通常，这个答案会涉及从某个相邻领域引入一个想法，并能够跨越不同领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And usually that answer involves bringing in some idea from some adjacent space and basically being able to bridge domains.</p>
</details>

所以，你可能会问他们一个关于金融的问题，他们会从心理学中给你一个答案；或者你问他们一个关于心理学的问题，他们会从生物学中给你一个答案，诸如此类。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and so you know you'll ask them a question about I don't know you know finance and they'll they'll bring you an answer from psychology or you ask them a question about psychology and they'll bring you an answer from biology right or whatever it is.</p>
</details>

我认识，嗯，今天坐在这里，我大概认识三个人能可靠地做到这一点，而我的通讯录里有10,000人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I I know you know I know I don't know sitting here today probably three I probably know three people who can do that reliably out of the you know I I've got you know I've got 10,000 in my address book.</p>
</details>

所以，10,000人中只有三个人，这个比例并不高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and so three out of 10,000 is not is not that high a percentage.</p>
</details>

顺便说一句，我觉得这非常令人鼓舞。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By by the way, I find this very encouraging.</p>
</details>

是的，房间里的气氛立刻变得非常糟糕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like I I yeah, immediately the mood in the room has gone completely to hell.</p>
</details>

我发现这非常令人鼓舞，因为看看人类在所有局限性下所能建造的一切，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I find this very encouraging. I find this very encouraging because look at what humanity has been able to build, right? Despite all of our limitations, right?</p>
</details>

看看我们所展现的所有创造力，所有令人惊叹的艺术、电影、小说，以及所有令人惊叹的技术发明和科学突破。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and look at all the creativity that we've been able to exhibit and all the amazing art and all the amazing movies and all the amazing novels and all the amazing technical inventions and scientific breakthroughs.</p>
</details>

所以，我们能够在现有局限性下做我们所能做的一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so we, you know, we've been able to do, you know, everything we've been able to do with the limitations that we have.</p>
</details>

因此，我认为，你是否需要达到100%确定它正在进行原创思考的程度？我不这么认为。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and so, you know, I think that, you know, like, you know, do you need to get to the thing where you are 100% positive that's actually doing, you know, original thinking? I don't think so.</p>
</details>

我认为如果你能做到那会很棒，而且我认为最终我们可能会得出结论，这就是正在发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, I I think it'd be great if you did, and I think ultimately we'll probably conclude that that's what's happening.</p>
</details>

但是，对于巨大的进步来说，这并不是必需的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, but like I it's not necessary for like just tremendous amounts of improvement.</p>
</details>

**Eric Torberg:** Ben，我们上周在你的“付费完成”（Paid in Full）活动中刚刚庆祝了一些嘻哈传奇人物，所以你对创造性天才有很多思考。你如何看待这个问题？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ben, we were just celebrating some some hip-hop legends at your paid in full uh event last week and so you think a lot about creative genius. How do you think about this question?</p>
</details>

**Ben Horowitz:** 是的，我的意思是，我同意Marc的观点，无论它是什么，它都非常有用，即使它没有达到那个水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I mean I think that uh I agree with Mark that it's whatever it is, it's very useful. um even if it isn't all the way that level uh I think that you know there's something about the actual like real time human experience that humans are very into um at least in art where you know with the current state of the technology kind of the the pre-training doesn't have quite the the right data to to to get to um what you really want to Uh but it, you know, it's pretty good.</p>
</details>

我认为，人类非常喜欢实际的实时人类体验，至少在艺术方面，以当前技术水平来看，预训练数据并没有完全达到你真正想要的效果。但它，你知道，已经相当不错了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that you know there's something about the actual like real time human experience that humans are very into um at least in art where you know with the current state of the technology kind of the the pre-training doesn't have quite the the right data to to to get to um what you really want to Uh but it, you know, it's pretty good.</p>
</details>

**Eric Torberg:** 它确实相当不错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is pretty good.</p>
</details>

**Marc Andreessen:** 多少真正的概念创新者？Ben，Ben的非营利活动之一是**Pain and Fall Foundation**，它旨在表彰并为说唱和嘻哈领域的伟大创新者提供养老金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How many So how many true conceptual So Ben Ben Ben Ben's Ben, one of Ben's nonprofit activities is something called the Pain and Fall Foundation, which is honoring and actually providing essentially a pension a pension for uh you know, for sort of, you know, the great innovators in in in rap and hip-hop.</p>
</details>

所以他认识并拥有许多——我们刚刚参加了活动，他拥有过去50年来该领域许多领军人物的表演，与他们见面和交谈真的很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and and so he has he knows and has many of we were just at the event and he you know has many of the kind of leading lights of that field for the last 50 years you know perform and and it's really fun to meet them and talk to them.</p>
</details>

但是，在过去50年的整个领域中，你会将多少人归类为真正的概念创新者？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um but like how many people in that entire field over the course of the last 50 years would you classify as like a true conceptual innovator?</p>
</details>

**Ben Horowitz:** 是的。嗯，这很有趣。这取决于你如何宽泛地定义它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Well, you know it's interesting. Well, it depends how broadly you define it but.</p>
</details>

**Marc Andreessen:** 上周六有几位。Rakim，你肯定会把他归入那一类。Dr. Dre，你肯定会把他归入那一类。George Clinton，你肯定会把他归入那一类。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know there were several of them there last you know on Saturday. Rock, I think. Yeah, Rockm, you'd certainly put in that category. Dr. Dre, you'd certainly put in that category. George Clinton, you'd certainly put in that category. Um,</p>
</details>

**Ben Horowitz:** 嗯，从更狭义的角度来说，像Cool G Rap肯定有一个新想法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know, in a narrower sense, like Cool G Rap certainly had a new idea. Um,</p>
</details>

但你知道，这取决于，如果是一个根本性的音乐突破，你可能只会说像Rakim和George Clinton。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but you know, it depends like a fundamental kind of musical breakthrough, you probably just say like Rock Kim and George Clinton.</p>
</details>

**Marc Andreessen:** 所以，只有两个？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, so two out of.</p>
</details>

**Ben Horowitz:** 嗯，我的意思是，那些是当时在场的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I mean those of the guys who were there.</p>
</details>

**Marc Andreessen:** 哦，是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, yeah. Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Ben Horowitz:** 是的，但这是一个很小的比例。非常非常小。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. But yeah, it's a tiny percentage. Tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny.</p>
</details>

### 超越智力的成功因素：情商与情境理解

**Eric Torberg:** 我们昨晚和Jared Leto一起炉边谈话，他谈到好莱坞有多少人对此感到非常害怕或反对。你和Dr. Dre、Nas、Kanye等人交谈时，他们是兴奋的吗？他们在用它吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We had Jared at the fireside last night with Jared Leto. He was talking about how many people in Hollywood are are really scared or against this um what's happening here is is what do you see in you know when you talk to the Dr. JS the nas the Kanye's are they excited? Are they using it? Are they?</p>
</details>

**Ben Horowitz:** 是的，不，我跟所有我交谈过的人都说，音乐界肯定有人感到害怕，但也有很多人非常非常感兴趣，尤其是嘻哈界的人，因为这几乎是他们曾经做过的事情的重演。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. No, I the so everybody uh who I speak to there are definitely people who are scared in music but like there are a lot of people who are very very interested in it and particularly the hip-hop guys are interested because um it's almost like a replay of what they did right that they just took other music and they kind of built new music out of it.</p>
</details>

他们只是拿了别人的音乐，然后用它创造了新的音乐，我认为AI对他们来说是一个绝佳的创意工具。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think that you know AI is uh a fantastic creative tool for them.</p>
</details>

它极大地拓展了他们的创作范围，而且嘻哈的很多内容都是讲述特定时间和地点的特定故事，而对这些内容有深入了解并专门为此进行训练，实际上是一个优势，而不是像一个普遍聪明的音乐模型那样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">like way opens up the pallet and then for you know a lot of what hip-hop is is it's um kind of telling a very specific story of a specific time and place which um having intimate knowledge and being trained just on that thing is is actually an advantage as opposed being like a generally smart uh music model.</p>
</details>

人们也用同样的逻辑，认为更智能的会统治不那么智能的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, people also use the same logic of, hey, whatever is more intelligent will rule whatever is less intelligent.</p>
</details>

Marc，你最近——

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and Mark, you recently uh.</p>
</details>

**Marc Andreessen:** 这不是任何养猫的人会说的话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">not not said by anybody who owns a cat.</p>
</details>

**Ben Horowitz:** 是的，没错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, exactly.</p>
</details>

**Eric Torberg:** Marc，你最近发推文说：“一个至高无上的图形旋转器只能旋转图形，但一个至高无上的词语单元可以旋转图形旋转器。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mark, you recently tweeted, "A supreme shape rotator can only rotate shapes, but a supreme word cell can rotate shape rotators."</p>
</details>

还有——

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and also,</p>
</details>

**Marc Andreessen:** 有人在鼓掌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">someone's clapping here.</p>
</details>

**Eric Torberg:** 还有，高智商专家为中智商通才工作。这意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And also, high IQ experts work for midiq generalists. What means?</p>
</details>

**Marc Andreessen:** 是的，这意味着什么？是的，就是博士都为MBA工作，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. What what means? Uh yeah. So it's the PhDs all work for MBAs, right?</p>
</details>

所以，你知道，好的。是的，我只是，你知道，把它提升一个层次。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it's like, you know, okay. So yeah, like so yeah. Well, I just, you know, just take it up a level.</p>
</details>

当你审视当今世界时，你认为我们是由聪明人统治的吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's just like when you look at the world today, do you think we're being ruled by the smart ones, right?</p>
</details>

这是你从当前事件、时事中得出的主要结论吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like is that is that your big conclusion from like current events, current affairs, right?</p>
</details>

比如，我们让天才掌权了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like okay, we put the geniuses in charge. Like.</p>
</details>

**Eric Torberg:** 你的意思是Kamala Harris和Donald Trump不是最好的吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you mean Kamla and Trump aren't the best?</p>
</details>

**Marc Andreessen:** 嗯，现在我们甚至不特指美国。我们看看全世界。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, now let's not even be specific towards the US. let's just look all over the world.</p>
</details>

嗯，是的。所以，这就像，有这么一回事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, you know, yeah. And so like it's just like there's this thing.</p>
</details>

所以我认为有两件事是真的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think two two things are true.</p>
</details>

第一，我们可能都低估了智力的重要性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One is we we probably all kind of underwrite the importance of intelligence.</p>
</details>

实际上，这里有一个完整的背景故事，关于智力在过去一百年里出于各种原因，实际上变成了一个极其具有煽动性的议题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and actually there's a whole kind of backstory here of like intelligence actually turns out to be this like incredibly inflammatory, you know, kind of topic for lots of reasons over the last hundred years.</p>
</details>

我们可以详细讨论，但它，你知道，甚至“有些人比其他人更聪明”这个想法，就真的让人们感到不安，人们不喜欢谈论它，我们作为一个社会对此非常挣扎。

<p class="english-text">um uh which which we could we could talk about in great detail but like it it and you know it's and the even the just the very idea that like some people are smarter than other people you just like really freaks people out and people people don't like to talk about it we really struggle with that as a society.</p>

然后，智力在人类中确实与几乎所有积极的生活结果相关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so like and then it is true that intelligence is like in humans intelligence is correlated to almost every kind of positive life outcome right.</p>
</details>

所以，社会科学中通常所说的**流体智力**（Fluid Intelligence: 解决新问题、适应新环境的能力）或**G因子**（G Factor: 一般智力因素）或**智商**（IQ: Intelligence Quotient: 衡量智力的标准）与几乎所有事物都呈0.4的相关性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so u intelligence generally in the social sciences what they'll tell you is what they call fluid intelligence or or the G factor or IQ is sort of it's sort of 0.4 four correlated to basically everything.</p>
</details>

所以，它与教育成果、职业成果、收入，以及生活满意度，甚至非暴力行为（即无需肢体暴力解决问题的能力）等都有0.4的相关性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and so it's 0.4 correlation to like educational outcomes and like you know professional outcomes and and you know income and by the way also like life satisfaction and by the way non-violence you know being able to solve problems without physical violence and so forth.</p>
</details>

所以，一方面，我们可能都低估了智力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so like on the one hand like we probably all underrate intelligence.</p>
</details>

另一方面，从事与智力相关领域的人可能高估了智力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um on the other hand the people who are in the fields that involve intelligence probably overrate intelligence.</p>
</details>

你甚至可以创造一个词，比如“智力至上主义者”（intelligence supremacist），他们认为智力非常重要，因此它可能是最重要或唯一重要的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and you might even you might even coin a term like maybe like intelligence supremacist or something like that where it's just like oh like intelligence is very important and so therefore maybe it's like the most important thing or the only thing.</p>
</details>

但当你审视现实时，你会发现情况显然并非如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But but then you look at reality and you're like okay that's clearly not the case.</p>
</details>

**Eric Torberg:** 是的。它仍然只有0.4，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. It's still zero only 0.4 right. Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Marc Andreessen:** 嗯，首先它只有0.4，而且在社会科学中，0.4是一个巨大的相关系数。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well so to start with it's only 0.4 and you know in the social sciences 0.4 is a giant correlation factor right.</p>
</details>

大多数在社会科学中，你能将基因或观察到的行为与任何事物关联起来的相关性都远小于此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">like most most things that where you can correlate whether it's you know genes or observed behavior whatever to anything in the social sciences the correlations are much smaller than that.</p>
</details>

所以0.4虽然很小，但仍然只有0.4。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So 0.4 is is tiny, but it's still only 0.4.</p>
</details>

所以，即使你是一个完全的基因决定论者，认为基因智商决定所有这些结果，它仍然无法解释60%的相关性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, even if you're like a fullon if you even if you're like a full-on genetic determinist and you're just like, you know, genetic IQ just like drives all these outcomes, like it still doesn't explain, you know, 6 uh of the correlation and so that leaves it but but that's just on the individual level.</p>
</details>

这只是在个体层面。然后你看看集体层面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then you just look at the collective level.</p>
</details>

有一个著名的观察是，你把一群人放在一起，让他们变成一个“暴民”，这个暴民会比平均水平更愚蠢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, you just look at the collective level and it's like a famous famous observation is you take a b you take a bunch of you take any group of people, you put them in a mob and the mob is dumber, right, than the average.</p>

你把一群聪明人放在一个暴民中，他们肯定会变得更愚蠢，你总是能看到这种情况，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and and and you put a bunch of smart people in a mob and they definitely turn dumber like and you see that all the time, right?</p>
</details>

所以，你把人们放在群体中，他们的行为会非常不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um uh and so you put people in groups and they they they behave very differently.</p>
</details>

然后你提出关于谁掌权的问题，无论是公司还是国家，无论过滤过程是什么，它显然不只是基于智商，甚至可能不是主要基于智商。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then you you create and then you create these you know questions around like who's in charge whether who's in charge at a at a company or who's in charge of a of a country and like it it's whatever the filtration process it's clearly not it's not it's it's not it's certainly not only on IQ and it may not even be primarily on IQ.</p>
</details>

因此，在一些AI圈子里你听到的这种假设，即“智能的东西必然会管理愚蠢的东西”，我只是认为这很容易被证伪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so so therefore it's just like this assumption that you kind of hear in some of the AI circles uh which is like inevitably the smart you know kind of thing is going to govern the dumb thing like I I just think that's like very easily uh it's just sort of very easily and obviously falsified like intelligence isn't sufficient and then you just you just you just convey it.</p>
</details>

智力并不充分。我们这个房间里的人都很幸运能认识很多聪明人，你观察聪明人，有些聪明人确实能把事情处理得井井有条，变得非常成功，而很多聪明人却从未成功。

<details>

<p class="english-text">You know, we're all in this room lucky enough to know a lot of smart people and you you just kind of observe smart people and like some smart people, you know, really figure out how to have their stuff together and become very successful and a lot of smart people never do.</p>
</details>

所以，成功以及谁掌权，除了纯粹的智力之外，显然还有许多其他因素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and so there there's there there there must be there obviously are and there and there in fact must be many other factors that have to do with success um and have to do with like who's in charge than just raw intelligence.</p>
</details>

这引出了一个后续问题：这些因素可能是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It it begs the the follow-up question of what are what are some examples of what that might be you know skills sort of outside of intelligence and more particularly specifically why couldn't AI systems you know learn them?</p>

能够解读他们思考方式的一切，并从公司员工的角度而不是你自己的角度看待决策，这是一种通过不断与人交流、理解他们所说的话等方式培养出来的技能。

<p class="english-text">you know being able to interpret everything about how they're thinking about it and just kind of generally seeing decisions through the eyes of the people working in the company not through your eyes is the skill that you you know you develop by talking to people all the time, understanding what they're saying, so forth, these kinds of things.</p>
</details>

这肯定不是智商问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's just um you know, it's certainly not an IQ thing.</p>

**Marc Andreessen:** 关于这一点，有趣的一点是，心智理论的概念非常重要，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, one of the interesting things on this like on this is right the the concept of theory of mind is really important, right?</p>

心智理论是你能否在脑海中模拟别人脑海中发生的事情，对吧？

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, theory of mind is can you in your head model what's happening in the other person's head, right?</p>

你可能会认为，也许更聪明的人应该更擅长这一点。

事实证明这可能不正确，原因如下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It turns out that that may not be true and I'll the reason to believe that that's not true which which is as follows.</p>
</details>

美国军方是**智商测试**（IQ Testing: 衡量智力水平的标准化测试）的早期采用者，并且一直以来都是美国社会中实际采用智商测试的领先者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the so the the US military is was the early adopter and has continued to be sort of the leading adopter in in US society of of of actually IQ testing.</p>

他们通过一种叫做**ASVAB**（Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery: 武装部队职业能力倾向测验）的测试来筛选，他们称之为职业能力倾向电池测试，但它本质上是一个智商测试。

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And they uh they they they basically launder it through something called the ASVAB which is their they call vocational aptitude battery test but it's basically an I it's essentially an IQ test.</p>
</details>

所以他们仍然使用明确的智商测试，并根据智商将人们分配到不同的专业和角色，包括领导角色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and uh so they they they they still use basically explicit IQ tests and they they slot people uh into different specialties and roles uh you know in part with according IQ um including into leadership roles.</p>
</details>

他们知道每个人的智商，并围绕此进行组织。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and and so they they know what everybody's IQ is and they they kind of organize organize around that.</p>
</details>

他们多年来发现的一件事是，如果领导者的智商与追随者相差超过一个**标准差**（Standard Deviation: 衡量数据离散程度的统计量），就会出现真正的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And one of the things that they found over the years is if the leader is more than one standard deviation of IQ away from the followers, it's a real problem.</p>
</details>

这在两个方向上都成立，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and and and that's true in both directions, right?</p>
</details>

如果领导者不够聪明，无法管理，也就是说，对于一个不那么聪明的人来说，模拟一个更聪明的人的心理行为，这本身就非常具有挑战性，甚至可能是不可能的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um if if the leader is not smart enough to be able to right manage the you know is to be able to mo you know for somebody who is less smart to model the mental behavior of somebody who's more smart is inher of course inherently very challenging and maybe impossible.</p>
</details>

但事实证明反过来也成立，如果领导者的智商比他所管理的组织平均水平高出两个标准差，他也会失去心智理论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it turns out the reverse is also true which is if the leader is two standard deviations above the norm of the organization that he's running. He also loses theory of mind.</p>
</details>

对吧？对于非常聪明的人来说，模拟甚至中等聪明的人的内部思维过程实际上非常困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right? it it's it's actually very hard for very smart people to um to to model uh the internal thought processes of even moderately smart people.</p>
</details>

所以，实际上需要一定程度的连接。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and so there there's actually there's actually a real there's actually a real need to have a level of connection there that's not just right.</p>
</details>

因此，推断而言，如果你有一个智商高达一千的人或机器，它对现实的理解会与它所管理的人或事物如此格格不入，以至于它甚至无法以任何现实的方式进行连接。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And therefore by inference if you had a person or a or a machine that had you know a thousand IQ or something like it it may just be it would be so alien its understanding of reality would be so alien to the people or the things that it was managing that it wouldn't it wouldn't even be able to connect in any sort any sort of realistic way.</p>

所以，这再次是一个很好的论证，说明世界在未来几个世纪都不会由智商来组织。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You do a lot of these skits.</p>
</details>

**Marc Andreessen:** 是的，这些短剧。然后我就会得意忘形，然后我就会说，原来他们都是秘密忍者，然后他们就开始打架，你看到Albert Einstein用双截棍打Niels Bohr，顺便说一句，它也很乐意这样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, these skits. And then I get carried away and then I'm like it turns out they're all like secret ninjas and then they all start fighting and you've got Einstein you know you know you know hitting you know Neils Bore with nunchucks and it and by the way it's happy to do that too.</p>
</details>

所以你必须控制自己，但它在心智理论方面非常出色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um so you do have to you have to you have to control yourself but it it is very good a theory of mind.</p>
</details>

我再给你举一个例子。英国有一家初创公司，在政治领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then I'll give you another example. There's a there's a startup actually in the UK uh in uh in in the world of politics.</p>
</details>

他们发现语言模型现在足够好，特别是在政治领域，这是一个这个想法很重要的子类别。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and what what they found is that um they found that language models now are good enough so specifically for for politics which is sort of a sub subcategory where this this idea matters.</p>
</details>

你知道，在政治中，人们总是对选民进行**焦点小组**（Focus Group: 一种市场研究方法，通过小组讨论收集对产品、服务或观念的反馈），许多企业也这样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um so you know in politics people do focus group you do focus groups of voters all the time and and by the way many businesses also do that.</p>
</details>

你把一群来自不同背景的人聚集在一个房间里，引导他们进行讨论，并试图了解他们对事物的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, you know, so you get a bunch of people together from different backgrounds in a room and you kind of guide them through a discussion and try to get their their points of view on things.</p>
</details>

焦点小组常常令人惊讶。如果你和做焦点小组的政治家交谈，他们常常会感到惊讶，因为他们认为选民关心的事情实际上并不是选民真正关心的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and focus groups are often surprising. Like politicians who if you talk to politicians who do focus groups, they're often surprising. They're often surprised by the things that they thought voters cared about is actually not the things that voters care about.</p>
</details>

所以通过这样做你可以学到很多东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so you can actually learn a lot by doing this.</p>
</details>

但焦点小组的运行成本非常高，而且由于必须实际组织，需要招募和审查人员等等，所以存在很长的滞后期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But focus groups are very expensive to run. And then there's a long lag time because they have to be actually physically organized and you have to recruit people and vet people and and so forth.</p>
</details>

事实证明，现在最先进的模型在这方面已经足够好，它们可以在模型内部准确地重现真实人群的焦点小组。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and so it turns out that the the the the state-of-the-art models now are are good enough at this so they can actually they can they can correctly um accurately reproduce a focus group of real people um inside the model.</p>
</details>

所以它们足够好，可以达到这个标准。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um so so so they're good enough to clear that bar.</p>
</details>

换句话说，你可以在模型中进行焦点小组，你在模型中创建角色，然后它会准确地代表，比如肯塔基州的大学生，与田纳西州的家庭主妇形成对比，与你指定的任何其他角色形成对比。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In other words, you you can basically have a focus group actually happening in the model where you create personas in the model and then it actually accurately represents, you know, a college student from, you know, Kentucky is contrasted to a housewife from Tennessee is contrasted to a, you know, whatever whatever you you just like specify this.</p>
</details>

所以，它们足够好，可以达到这个标准，我们拭目以待它们能走多远。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, you know, they're good enough to clear they're good enough to clear that bar and, you know, we'll we'll see how far they get.</p>
</details>

### AI泡沫论：市场与基本面

**Eric Torberg:** 我想转到关于泡沫的讨论。Amin和G2，Jensen和Matt谈到了正在建设的巨大物理基础设施规模。AI的资本支出占GDP的1%。我们应该如何理解和思考这个泡沫问题？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to segue to the bubble conversation. Uh, Amin and G2, Jensen and Matt spoke about the enormous scale of physical infrastructure being built out. AI capex is 1% of GDP. How should we understand and think about this bubble question?</p>
</details>

**Ben Horowitz:** 嗯，我认为它是一个问题这一事实意味着我们没有处于泡沫中。这是首先要理解的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think the fact that it's a question means we're not in a bubble. That's the first thing to understand.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，泡沫在很大程度上是一种心理现象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, a bubble is a psychological phenomenon um as much as anything.</p>
</details>

要形成泡沫，每个人都必须相信它不是泡沫。这才是它的核心机制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And in order to get to a bubble, everybody has to believe it's not a bubble. That that's sort of the the core mechanic of it.</p>
</details>

我们称之为**投降**（Capitulation: 市场中投资者放弃抵抗，大量抛售资产，标志着市场底部可能形成）。每个人都放弃了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that, you know, we call that capitulation.</p>
</details>

比如，“好吧，我不再做空这些股票了。我厌倦了亏钱。我要做多。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Everybody just gives up. Like, okay, I'm not going to short these stocks anymore. I'm tired of losing all my money. I'm going to go long.</p>
</details>

我们实际上在互联网泡沫时期看到了这一点，当时价格飙升，Warren Buffett开始投资科技股。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh and we saw that actually in, you know, and a little bit of question like really what was the tech bubble? Um but in the kind of.com era right as the prices went through the roof Warren Buffett started inviting investing in tech.</p>
</details>

他曾发誓永远不投资科技，因为他不理解它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So like and he swore he would never invest in tech because you didn't understand it.</p>
</details>

所以如果他都投降了，当它变成所谓的泡沫时，没有人会说它是泡沫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so if he capitulated nobody was saying it was a bubble when it became like a quote unquote bubble.</p>
</details>

现在如果你看那种现象，互联网显然不是泡沫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now if you look at that phenomenon um the internet clearly was not a bubble.</p>
</details>

它是一个真实的东西。短期内，由于当时网络上的人数不足以让这些产品运行，市场出现了一种价格错位，然后价格超出了市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh you know it it was a real thing. It was in the short term there was a kind of price dislocation that happened because uh the the market um you know there were just not enough people on the network to make those products go at the time uh and then the prices kind of outran the market.</p>
</details>

你知道，在AI领域，这更难看到，因为短期内有如此多的需求，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know, in AI, it's much harder to see that because there's so much demand in the short term, right?</p>
</details>

我们现在没有需求问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like we don't have a demand problem right now.</p>
</details>

我认为我们五年后会有需求问题的想法相当荒谬。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And like the idea that we're going to have a demand problem five years from now to me seems quite absurd.</p>
</details>

你知道，会不会出现奇怪的瓶颈，比如我们某个时候就是没有足够的冷却设备之类的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, you know, could there be like weird bottlenecks that that appear, you know, like we just at some point we just don't have enough cooling or something like that?</p>
</details>

是的，也许吧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, you know, maybe.</p>
</details>

但就像现在，如果你看需求和供应，以及正在发生的事情和相对于增长的倍数，对我来说一点也不像泡沫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But like like right now if you look at demand and supply and what's going on and multiples uh against growth, it doesn't look like a bubble at all to me.</p>
</details>

嗯，但我不知道。你认为这是泡沫吗，Marc？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um but I don't know. Do you think it's a bubble, Mark?</p>
</details>

**Marc Andreessen:** 是的，听着，我只想说，是的。没有人知道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Look, I I would just say this. Yeah. Like nobody know So nobody knows in the sense of like the experts like if you're talking to anybody at like a hedge fun or a bank or whatever, like they definitely don't know.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，专家们，如果你和对冲基金或银行的任何人交谈，他们肯定不知道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um uh generally the CEOs don't know.</p>
</details>

通常首席执行官也不知道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it the.</p>
</details>

**Ben Horowitz:** 顺便说一句，很多风险投资家也不知道，他们只是变得沮丧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">by the way a lot of VCs don't know that they just get upset like VCs get like emotionally upset when you guys have higher valuations like it it makes them like like angry.</p>
</details>

当你们有更高的估值时，风险投资家会情绪激动，这让他们很生气。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh and you know and I I get it all the time and I'm like what are you mad about?</p>
</details>

你知道，我总是遇到这种情况，我就会说：“你气什么？它在运作啊，伙计，高兴点。来吧。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like the is working man be happy. Come on.</p>
</details>

但所以，所以有很多情绪围绕着人们希望它成为一个泡沫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But so so like there's a lot of emotion around like people wanting it to be be a bubble.</p>
</details>

**Marc Andreessen:** 是的，没有什么比错过一笔交易然后公司大获成功更糟糕的了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. No, nothing's worse than passing on a deal and then having the company become a great success.</p>
</details>

这简直是——

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like it's just I was just just put.</p>
</details>

**Ben Horowitz:** 那个估值太离谱了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that that valuation is outrageous.</p>
</details>

**Marc Andreessen:** 在我们这个行业，你可以为此愤怒30年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can be furious about that for 30 years in our business. It's it's amazing.</p>
</details>

这太神奇了。你可以找到各种理由来应对和解释为什么这不是你的错误。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and you can find Yeah. You come up with all kinds of reasons to cope and and explain why it wasn't your mistake.</p>
</details>

但你知道，是世界错了，不是我。对吧？所以有很多这样的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it's you know it's the world it's the world that's wrong, not me. Right.</p>
</details>

是的。所以，我只想说，我总是会把对话带回到基本事实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there there's a lot of that. Yeah. Uh yeah. So I I just I would just I would just say like I would always say bring the conversation back to ground truth fundamentals.</p>
</details>

两个大的基本事实是：第一，技术是否真的有效？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the the two big ground truth fundamentals are number one, does the technology actually work?</p>
</details>

它能否兑现承诺？第二，客户是否为此付费？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, you know, can it deliver on its promise? And then number two, is are customers paying for it?</p>
</details>

如果这两个条件都成立，那么只要这两个条件保持不变，通常情况下事情就会按部就班。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and if those if those two things are true, then it's very hard to it's very hard to uh like as long as those two things stay grounded. Um, you know, gen generally generally things are going to I think are going to be on track.</p>
</details>

**Eric Torberg:** 是的。当Gavin和DG在这里时，他说ChatGPT是Google的“珍珠港时刻”，是巨头觉醒的时刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. When Gavin was up here with DG, he said chatbt was a Pearl Harbor moment for Google, the moment when the giant wakes up.</p>
</details>

当我们回顾历史和平台转变时，什么决定了现有企业能否赢得下一波浪潮，而不是新进入者？我们应该如何在AI领域思考这个问题？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when when we look at history and and platform shifts, what determine whether the incumbent actually wins the next wave versus versus new entrance or how should we think about that in in AMP?</p>
</details>

**Ben Horowitz:** 嗯，你知道，做出反应很重要。但这并不意味着它是一个珍珠港时刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, you know, reacting to it is important. Um, but that doesn't mean like I it's a Pearl Harbor moment.</p>
</details>

我认为Google清醒过来了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think Google got their head out of their ass. It was the sound of it.</p>
</details>

所以他们不会完全被碾压。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">Uh so you know they're not going to get completely run over but.</p>
</details>

然而，我认为OpenAI不会消失。所以他们确实让这种情况发生了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">nonetheless like I don't think open AI is going away. So like they they definitely let that happened.</p>
</details>

是的，其中一部分是速度，然后就是长期执行力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um yeah some of it to speed and then just look it's execution over a long period of time.</p>
</details>

你知道，这些非常大的公司在不同程度上失去了执行能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And uh you know some of these very large companies to varying degrees have lost their ability to execute.</p>
</details>

所以如果你谈论一个全新的平台，如果你谈论长期建设，就像Microsoft在Google上措手不及一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so if you're talking about a brand new platform and you're talking about, you know, kind of building for a long time, it's like, you know, Microsoft got caught with their pants down on Google.</p>
</details>

Microsoft仍然非常强大，但他们错过了整个机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, Microsoft's still like very strong, but they missed that whole opportunity.</p>
</details>

他们也错过了机会。你知道，Apple当时什么都不是，Microsoft完全相信他们将拥有移动计算。他们完全错过了那个机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They also missed the opportunity. You know, Apple was nothing and Microsoft fully believed that they were going to own mobile computing. They completely missed that one.</p>
</details>

但他们仍然因为Windows垄断而非常庞大，所以他们可以发展到其他领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But they were still so big from their Windows monopoly they could build into other things.</p>
</details>

所以你知道，我认为通常新公司会赢得新市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you know I think generally the new companies have won the new markets.</p>
</details>

这并不意味着大公司，前一代最大的垄断企业不会持续很长时间，这就是我的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh and that doesn't mean the big company the biggest companies the biggest monopolies from the prior generation just last a long time is the way I would look at it.</p>
</details>

**Marc Andreessen:** 是的。我也认为我们不太清楚，事情发生得太快了，我们实际上还不知道最终产品的形态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I I also think we don't quite know like it's all happened so fast we we actually don't I think we don't yet know the shape and form of the ultimate products.</p>

**Eric Torberg:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Marc Andreessen:** 对。所以，因为这很诱人，而且这总是会发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um Right. And so and so like because it's it's tempting and this is kind of what what always happens.</p>
</details>

有时你会听到这种简化版本，基本上就是：“哦，要么是聊天机器人，要么是搜索引擎。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's kind of it's kind of tempting to look I'm not saying what that's what these guys did on stage but it's kind of tempting to look you sometimes you hear the kind of reductive version of this which is basically it's like oh there's either going to be a chatbot or a search engine right.</p>
</details>

竞争是在聊天机器人和搜索引擎之间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The competition is between a chatbot and a search engine.</p>

Google面临的问题是经典的**颠覆**（Disruption: 指新技术或商业模式对现有市场和行业造成的根本性改变）问题，也就是**创新者困境**（The Innovator's Dilemma: 指成功企业因专注于现有客户需求而忽视颠覆性创新，最终被新进入者超越的现象）。

<p class="english-text">And the problem Google has is the classic problem of dis you know disruption. are you going to disrupt the 10 blue links model and swap in you know at you know sort of uh AI answers and you know potentially disrupt the advertising model.</p>

<p class="english-text">Are you going to disrupt the 10 blue links model and swap in you know at you know sort of uh AI answers and you know potentially disrupt the advertising model.</p>

OpenAI面临的问题是他们有完整的聊天产品，但他们还没有广告，也没有Google规模的分发。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And then the problem OpenAI has is they have the the full you know the full chat product but you know they don't have the advertising yet and they don't have the distribution Google scale distribution.</p>

所以，你会说：“好吧，这是一个相当，这就像直接出自《创新者困境》这本商业教科书。”

但这假设了，你知道，你思考方式中可能犯的错误是，它假设在未来5、10、15、20年，人们将主要使用的产品形式要么是搜索引擎，要么是聊天机器人，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But that assumes that you know the mistake that you could make in thinking way is that assumes that the forms of the product in 5 10 15 20 years that that are going to be the main things that people use are going to be either a search engine or a chatbot, right?</p>
</details>

而且，你知道，有明显的历史类比。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and and you know the just there's you know there's just obvious historical analogies.</p>

一个明显的历史类比是，从1975年个人电脑发明到1992年，它基本上是一个文本提示系统，对吧？

当时，顺便说一句，交互式文本提示比上一代打孔卡系统、分时系统是一个巨大的进步。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, you know, and at the time, by the way, an interactive text prompt was a big advance over the previous generation of like punch card systems, time sharing systems.</p>

然后，你知道，那是1992年，也就是17年后，整个行业转向了GUI，再也没有回头。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, and then, you know, it was, you know, 1992, so was what, seven, 17 years in, you know, the whole industry took a left turn into GUIEs and never looked back, you know.</p>

然后，顺便说一句，五年后，行业转向了网页浏览器，再也没有回头，对吧？

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then by the way, you know, 5 years after that, the industry took a left turn in web browsers and never looked back, right?</p>

所以，用户体验的形态、形式和性质，以及它如何融入我们的生活，我认为仍然未成形。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so the very shape and form and nature of the user experience and how it and how it fits into our lives, uh, you know, is is is is I think still unformed.</p>

所以，你知道，我相信20年后仍然会有聊天机器人，但我相当确信，当前的聊天机器人公司和许多新公司都将开发出许多截然不同、我们甚至尚未知晓的用户体验。

<p class="english-text">And so like and you know, look, I'm I'm sure there will be chat bots 20 years from now, but I I'm I'm pretty confident that, um, you know, both the current chatbot companies and many new companies are going to figure out many kinds of user experiences that are radically different that we don't we don't even know yet.</p>

是的，顺便说一句，这也是让科技行业充满乐趣的原因之一，尤其是在软件方面，产品的形态和形式并不明显。

### AI人才与基础设施的供需变化

**Eric Torberg:** 当你指导企业家和在座的企业家时，这个时代还有什么不同之处？或者你发现自己有什么其他建议，无论是关于正在进行的人才争夺战还是这个时代独有的其他方面？你还想给我们的企业家留下什么这个时代独有的建议？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so trying to learn the organizational design lessons of the past or trying to learn um kind of too much from the last generation is can be deceptive because things really are different.</p>

从外部观察，它真的非常不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And like you know observing from the outside it's really different.</p>
</details>

**Eric Torberg:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Marc Andreessen:** 是的。我只想说，我确实认为事情会改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And I would just offer like I I do think things are going to change.</p>
</details>

所以我已经谈到，我认为产品的形态和形式会改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I already talked about I think the shape and form of products is going to change.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为那里仍然有很多创造力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um uh and so like I think there's still a lot of creativity there.</p>
</details>

我还认为，在一个供需世界中，造成过剩的是短缺。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I also think and I I I let's say I think that um like in a in a world of supply and demand the thing that creates gluts is shortages.</p>
</details>

对，所以当某物变得过于稀缺时，就会产生巨大的经济激励来寻找新的供应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um right so like when something becomes too scarce there becomes a massive economic incentive to figure out how to unlock new supply.</p>
</details>

所以当前一代的AI公司正在真正努力解决特别稀缺的顶尖AI研究人员和工程师的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so the the the current generation of AI companies are really struggling with uh particular shortages of of the really talented AI researchers and engineers.</p>
</details>

然后他们真正面临基础设施容量、芯片和数据中心以及电力的短缺挑战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then they're really you know challenged with shortage of of infrastructure capacity chips and and data centers and power.</p>
</details>

我不想对此进行时间预测。总有一天，这两者都会变得过剩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I I don't want to call timing on this. There will come a time when both of those things become gluts.</p>
</details>

所以，我不知道，我不知道我们能否为此做计划。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and so you I don't know I don't know that we can plan for that.</p>
</details>

尽管我只想说以下几点：第一，研究人员和工程师方面，令人震惊的是，现在中国正在涌现出优秀的模型。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um although I I would just say the following. Number one, um the the the researcher engineer side of things, it is striking. It is striking to the degree to which um there are excellent, you know, outstanding models coming out of China now.</p>
</details>

你知道，来自多家公司，具体来说是**Deepseek**、**Qwen**和**Kimi**。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um you know, and and in a m from multiple companies and you know, specifically, you know, uh Deepseek and and Quinn and Kimmy.</p>
</details>

令人震惊的是，制造这些模型的团队，在很大程度上，并不是那些名字出现在所有论文上的知名人物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um it is striking how the teams that are making those are not, you know, the name brand, you know, for the most part, these are not like the name brand people with their names on all the papers.</p>
</details>

所以，中国正在成功地解码如何基本上培养年轻人进入这个领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and and so like China is successfully decoding how to like basically take young people and train them up in the field.</p>
</details>

**Ben Horowitz:** 嗯，XAI在很大程度上也是如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, and XAI to a large extent too.</p>
</details>

**Marc Andreessen:** 是的。所以，我认为，我认为会有一个时期，它会是一种超乎寻常的专业技能，人们会为此付出高昂代价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. And so I I think that I think there's going to be and look it makes sense up until it it makes sense that for a while it's going to be this super esoteric skill set and people are going to pay through the nose for it.</p>
</details>

但你知道，毫无疑问，信息正在被传输到环境中。人们正在学习如何做这件事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But like you know there's no question the information is right being transferred into the environment. People are learning how to do this.</p>
</details>

大学生正在弄明白。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um you know college kids are figuring it out.</p>
</details>

所以，嗯，你知道，我不知道是否会有一个人才过剩期，但我想未来肯定会有更多的人知道如何构建这些东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and so, um, you know, there's there's and I don't know that there's ever going to be a talent glut per se, but like I think for sure there's gonna there's gonna be a lot more people in the future who of course know know how to build these things.</p>
</details>

然后，顺便说一句，当然还有AI构建AI，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and then and then by the way also of course you know AI building AI, right?</p>
</details>

所以工具本身将更好地为此做出贡献。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that the the the the tools themselves are going to be better better at at contributing to that.</p>
</details>

我认为这很好，因为我认为当前工程师和研究人员的短缺水平限制性太强了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so and and I think that I think this is good because I think that you know the current level of of shortage of of engineers and researchers is is is too constraining.</p>
</details>

然后在芯片方面，我不想——我不是芯片专家，我不想具体评论，但情况从未如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then and then on the chip side I don't I don't want to I'm not a chip guy and I don't want to call call it specifically but like it it's never been the case.</p>
</details>

在芯片行业，从未有过任何短缺最终没有导致过剩的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's never been the case in the ship industry that there's ever, you know, every every shortage in the ship industry has always resulted in a glut uh because the the profit the profit pool of a shortage, the margins get too big, the incentive uh for other people to come in and figure out how to commoditize the function get too big.</p>
</details>

因为短缺的利润池，利润率变得太大，其他人进来并找出如何商品化该功能的激励变得太大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because the the profit the profit pool of a shortage, the margins get too big, the incentive uh for other people to come in and figure out how to commoditize the function get too big.</p>
</details>

所以，你知道，Nvidia可能拥有芯片领域有史以来最好的地位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, you know, Nvidia has like, you know, the best position probably anybody's ever had in chips.</p>
</details>

但尽管如此，我很难相信五年后基础设施仍会面临这种程度的压力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But notwithstanding that, I I find it hard to believe that there's going to be this level of pressure on infrastructure in 5 years.</p>
</details>

**Eric Torberg:** 是的。即使基础设施内部的瓶颈转移了，如果变成电力、冷却或任何其他东西，那么肯定会出现芯片过剩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And even if the bottleneck within the infrastructure moves, so if if it becomes power, if it becomes cooling or or or anything else, then you'll have a chip glut for sure.</p>
</details>

是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Marc Andreessen:** 所以，我认为，我只想说，五年后我们面临的挑战可能会有所不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So So I I think over the I I would just say this, it's likely the challenges that we that we all have in five years from now are going to be different challenges.</p>
</details>

**Eric Torberg:** 是的。是的。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
</details>

不要，绝对不要把我们这个行业看作是静止不变的，你知道，地位可能会非常非常快地改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like don't don't definitely this industry of all industries don't look at us as static like you know the positions uh could change very very fast.</p>
</details>

### 中美AI竞争：软件与硬件的较量

**Eric Torberg:** 让我们以一个更宏观的视角来结束。Marc，你提到了中国。上个月我们在华盛顿特区，参议员们的一个大问题是，我们应该如何理解AI竞赛中与中国相比的现状？你愿意分享一下你与他们分享的高层总结吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's actually close on a more of this macro note. Mark, you mentioned China. Last month, we were in DC and what one of the big questions the senator has is how should we make sense of sort of the state of the AI race visa v China. Do you you want to share just the the high level um summary of what what you shared with them?</p>
</details>

**Marc Andreessen:** 是的。我对事情的看法，我认为当前的——如果你观察当前中国涌现的Deepseek、Qwen和Kimi等模型，我的基本看法是：我认为美国，特别是西方，但越来越具体地说是美国，在概念创新方面一直处于领先地位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So my sense of things and I and I think the current I think the current if you just observe currently specifically like deep sea quan and and these models coming out of China I my my sense basically is like I would say the US specifically in the west generally but you know more and more specifically the US is like the conceptual innovations are you know have been you know coming out coming out of coming out of the US coming out of the west you know kind of the the big kind of conceptual breakthroughs um uh China is extremely good at picking up ideas and implementing them and scaling them and commoditizing them and and you know that's that they do that obviously throughout the manufacturing world.</p>
</details>

你知道，那些重大的概念性突破来自美国，来自西方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know kind of the the big kind of conceptual breakthroughs um uh China is extremely good at picking up ideas and implementing them and scaling them and commoditizing them and and you know that's that they do that obviously throughout the manufacturing world.</p>
</details>

中国非常擅长采纳想法并实施、扩展和商品化它们，你知道，他们在整个制造业世界中都这样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">China is extremely good at picking up ideas and implementing them and scaling them and commoditizing them and and you know that's that they do that obviously throughout the manufacturing world.</p>
</details>

现在他们在AI领域也做得非常成功。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and and they're doing it now very I think successfully uh sort of in AI.</p>
</details>

所以我认为他们正在非常好地进行追赶。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and so I would say that they're running they're running the catch-up game like really well.</p>
</details>

然后总有一个问题，即其中有多少是“真实地”通过努力工作和聪明人完成的，又有多少可能是在夜深人静时通过一些“帮助”，比如一个U盘完成的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um you know and then there's there's sort of always this question of like how much of that is like being done let's just say like authentically um uh you know through hard work um and smart people and then how much is being done with maybe a little bit of help um maybe a little USB stick uh in the middle of the night uh you know kind of help um Okay.</p>
</details>

所以，你知道，总会有一点疑问，但无论如何，他们做得很好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, uh, you know, there's always a little bit of a question, but like either either way, uh, you know, they're they're doing a great job.</p>
</details>

显然他们渴望更多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, obviously they they aspire to, you know, more than that.</p>
</details>

中国有很多非常聪明和有创造力的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and there are many very smart and creative people in China.</p>
</details>

所以，现在看看概念性突破从那里开始涌现的程度，以及他们是否会超越，这将很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, you know, it will be interesting now to see, you know, the level to which the conceptual breakthroughs start to come from there and whether they whether they pull ahead.</p>
</details>

所以，我想说的是，我们告诉华盛顿的人们：“看，这是一场全面的竞赛。这是一场赛跑。这是一场寸土必争的比赛。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and so, but like I would say like what we tell people in Washington is like look this this is a foot this is now this is a full-on race. It's a foot race. It's a game of inches.</p>
</details>

我们不会有五年的领先优势。我们可能只有六个月的领先优势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like we're not going to have a 5year lead. we're going to have like maybe a six-month lead.</p>
</details>

我们必须跑得快。我们必须赢。我们必须做到这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like we have to run fast. We have to win. Like we we have to we have to do this.</p>
</details>

我们不能对我们的公司施加中国政府没有对其公司施加的限制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We we can't and then we can't put constraints on our companies that the the the Chinese government isn't putting on their own companies.</p>
</details>

所以，你知道，我们只会输。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so um you know we'll just lose.</p>
</details>

你真的想早上醒来生活在一个由中国AI控制和运行的世界里吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know do do you really want do you really want to wake up in the morning and live in a world you know really controlled and run by Chinese AI?</p>
</details>

我们大多数人会说不，我们不想生活在那个世界里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Most of us would say no we don't want to live in that world.</p>
</details>

所以，有这么一回事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and so um so so that so there's that.</p>
</details>

我对此感到适度乐观，因为我认为我们在软件方面非常出色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I would say I feel moderately good about that just because I think that I think we're we're really good at software.</p>
</details>

你知道，一旦这进入机器人形式的**具身AI**（Embodied AI: 具有物理身体并能与真实世界交互的人工智能），我认为事情会变得更可怕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um you know the minute this goes into you know embodied AI in the form of robotics I think things get a lot scarier.</p>
</details>

你知道，这就是我现在在华盛顿特区花时间试图真正教育人们的事情，因为美国和西方在过去40年里选择了**去工业化**（De-industrialization: 工业生产和制造业就业岗位减少的经济和社会过程），以至于现在中国拥有一个巨大的工业生态系统，用于制造各种机械、电气、半导体和软件设备，包括手机、无人机、汽车和机器人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know this is the thing I'm now spending time in DC trying to really educate people on which is you know the ch because the US and the west have chosen to de-industrialize to the extent that we have over the last 40 years um you know China China specifically now has this giant industrial ecosystem for building you know sort of mechanical electrical and um uh and semiconductor and now software you know devices of all kinds including phones and drones phones and cars um and robots.</p>
</details>

所以，AI革命将进入第二阶段，那就是机器人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and so uh you know there's going to be a phase two to the AI revolution. It's going to be robotics.</p>
</details>

我认为它会很快发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's going to happen you know pretty quickly here I think.</p>
</details>

当它发生时，即使美国在软件方面保持领先，机器人也必须被制造出来，这不是一件容易的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and when it does like even if the US stays ahead in software like the robots's got to get built and that's not an easy thing.</p>
</details>

这不仅仅是一家公司能做到的，它需要一个完整的生态系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's not just like a company that does that. It's got to be an entire ecosystem.</p>
</details>

你知道，汽车行业不是三家汽车公司，而是成千上万的零部件供应商制造所有零件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and it's you know it's going to be you know like I mean you know the car industry was not three car companies. It was thousands and thousands of of of component suppliers building all the parts.</p>
</details>

飞机、电脑和其他所有东西都是如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's been the same thing for airplanes and the same thing for computers and everything else.</p>
</details>

机器人也将如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um it's going to be the same thing for robotics.</p>
</details>

你知道，默认情况下，今天坐在这里，这一切都将在中国发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and you know by default sitting here today that's all going to happen in China.</p>
</details>

所以即使他们在软件方面从未完全赶上我们，他们也可能在硬件方面超越我们，然后就结束了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so even if they never quite catch us in software they might just like lap us in hardware and and that'll be that.</p>
</details>

你知道，好消息是，我认为在美国的政治光谱中，人们越来越意识到去工业化走得太远了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um you know the good news is I I think there's a growing awareness in there's a growing awareness I would say across the political political spectrum in the US that like de-industrialization went too far.</p>
</details>

人们越来越希望找到逆转这种趋势的方法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh and there's a growing desire to kind of figure out how to reverse that.</p>
</details>

嗯，你知道，我谨慎乐观地认为我们在这方面会取得进展，但我认为还有很多工作要做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and um, you know, I say I'm guardedly optimistic that we'll be making progress on that, but I think there's a lot of work to be done.</p>
