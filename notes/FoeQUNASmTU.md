### 财富的简单之路

**[主持人]**: 如果你的目标是在年轻时实现财务独立，这可能是一个非常有争议的观点：你可能并不想去买房。因为人们通常会买一套他们根本负担不起的房子。银行希望你这么做，因为那是他们赚最多钱的方式。你把资本投入到那座房子里，现在它不再是能生钱的资产了，它只是闲置在那里。人们会说：“嗯，你知道，我可以买这房子，因为我的房贷和租金是一样的。” 没错，但房贷只是支出的起点。那么，如果我想变得富有，首先会想到什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Host]**: If your goal is to become financially independent at a young age, this is a very controversial thing to say, you probably don't want to go buy a house because people typically buy a house they can't possibly afford. The bank wants you to do that cuz that's how they make the most money. So, you're putting your capital into that house and now it's not going to be earning thing. It's going to be sitting idally. And people say, "Well, you know, I can buy this house cuz my mortgage is the same as my rent." Well, yeah, but your mortgage is just the starting point. So, what comes to mind if I want to be financially wealthy?

</details>

**[JL Collins]**: 好的，我们有很多内容要讲。**JL Collins** 是一位著名的财务专家，以他的著作 **《通往财富的简单之路》**（The Simple Path to Wealth）而闻名。他正在教导数百万人一种简单且现实的致富途径，让任何人都能获得财务安全。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[JL Collins]**: Okay, so we've got a lot to go through. JL Collins is a renowned financial expert known for his book, The Simple Path to Wealth. He's teaching millions a straightforward and realistic avenue for achieving wealth so that anyone can have financial security.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 什么是通往财富的简单之路？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Host]**: What is the simple path to wealth?

</details>

**[JL Collins]**: 首先，**避免债务**，因为如果你背负着债务，你永远无法实现财务独立。其次，**量入为出**。但问题在于，我们的文化教导我们思考金钱的方式完全基于“你能用它买什么”。但你生活中的“必需品”越多，你变得富有的可能性就越小。最后一点，**投资余钱**。**股票**是人类创造过的最有效、最强大的财富积累工具。但我收到的最大反对比意见来自那些说：“嗯，这很好。我是说，如果你收入很高，一年赚 10 万、20 万或 30 万美元，那么财富的简单之路当然对你有效。” 事实并非如此。例如，我的一个朋友，他一年赚 100 万美元，但他却破产了。因为高收入的人更容易被卷入“与邻居攀比”的怪圈，而收入较低的人可能没有同样的社会压力，更容易做到这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[JL Collins]**: So, first of all, avoid debt because you can never be financially independent if you're carrying around debt. Next, live on less than you earn. But the problem is the way our culture has taught us to think about money is solely in terms of what can you buy with it. But the more musthaves you have in your life, the less likely you are to become wealthy. And then the final one, invest the surplus. So stocks are the single most effective, strongest wealth building tool that's ever been created. But the biggest push back I get is from people who say, "Well, that's great. I mean, if you got a big income, 100, 200, $300,000 a year, then yeah, the simple path to wealth will work for you." That's not the truth. For instance, a friend of mine and he was making a million dollars a year and he was broke because people have large incomes are much more likely to be drawn into the competing with the Joneses, whereas the people who make less money probably don't have those same social pressures and are more readily able to do it.

### 买房：是投资还是昂贵的嗜好？

**[主持人]**: 那么让我们谈谈投资。你认为此时此刻我们应该把钱投到哪里？我应该买 **比特币** 吗？我需要财务顾问吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Host]**: So, let's talk about investing then. Where do you think we should be investing our money at this moment of time? Should I buy Bitcoin? Do I need a financial adviser?

</details>

**[JL Collins]**: 我的建议，这与目前市面上常见的建议有些不同。我写那本书其实是我的博客的产物。我开始写博客是为了存档我想让我女儿掌握的信息，因为如果你处理好了金钱问题，你的生活会变得好得多。你会有更多的选择。世界为那些拥有资源的人提供了很多机会，而为那些没有资源的人提供的却很少。如果你没有资源，生活就会变得比原本需要的困难得多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[JL Collins]**: So, my advice, and this is a little different than the more common advice out there, would be... I actually that book was an outgrowth of my blog. I started the blog to archive information I wanted my daughter to have available because if you get money right, your life is so much better. You have so many more options. And the world offers so much to people who have the resources with which to access it and so little for those people who don't have the resources to access those things. And and if you don't have it, it life is just so much harder than it than it needs to be.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 当你想到现在正在听这段对话的普通人时，他们在金钱方面有哪些根本性的误解或盲点？你可能正试图从你女儿的脑海中清除这些想法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Host]**: When you think about the average person listening right now, what is what are some of the fundamental sort of misconceptions or misunderstandings or what would you call it? Black spots that they have as it relates to money, the things they walk around assuming about money that are incorrect that that you were maybe trying to get out of your daughter's mind.

</details>

**[JL Collins]**: 对吧？书中有一章叫“如何思考金钱”。绝大多数人思考金钱的根本方式，是因为我们的文化教导我们的：思考金钱的方式完全基于“你能用它买什么”。比如现在的彩票奖金高达 10 亿美元。人们在排队买彩票。如果你采访排队的人说：“如果你赢了这 100 万美元，你会怎么做？” 你通常会听到：“我要还清债务，还清房贷，给父母买套房，给自己买辆兰博基尼。我要买，买，买。” 这是大多数人思考金钱的方式。这确实是金钱擅长的一点：它是交换媒介。但金钱能为你做的另一件事是**为你工作**。你的钱可以为你赚更多的钱。你可以用你的时间、精力和劳动去换取金钱，这是我们大多数人做的。但你也可以将赚到的一部分钱转化为投资，我称之为**购买你的自由**。现在你的钱在为你工作。所以，不要只考虑你的钱能买什么，开始考虑你的钱能赚什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[JL Collins]**: Right? So there's a chapter in the book called how to think about money. And the fundamental way I think the vast majority of people think about money because this is what our culture has taught us. The way our culture has taught us to think about money is solely in terms of what can you buy with it. So if you go to the average person that lottery for instance is like a billion dollars at the moment. So people are buying lottery tickets. And if you interviewed people standing in line to buy lottery tickets and said, "Okay, if you win this million dollar, what are you going to do with it?" Well, what you're typically going to hear is, "Well, I'm going to pay off my debts and I'm going to pay off my mortgage and I'm going to buy my parents a house and I'm going to buy myself a Lamborghini. I'm going to buy I'm going to buy I'm going to buy." That's the way most people think about money. And that's certainly one of the things that money is very good at. It is a means of exchange. But the other thing your money can do for you is work for you. Your money can make you more money. So you can exchange your time and effort and labor to earn money. And that's what most of us do. But you can also divert some of the money you earn into investments into what I call buying your freedom. And now your money is working for you. So instead of just thinking about what your money can buy, you can start thinking about what can your money earn.

</details>

### 什么是“FU Money”？

**[主持人]**: 你可以购买你的自由。为什么在你看来，这是一个关于金钱角色的重要重构？如果我开始通过这个镜头思考，会发生什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Host]**: You can buy your freedom. Why is that an important refraraming of the role of money in your view? What does that do if I start thinking about it through that lens?

</details>

**[JL Collins]**: 因为只要你依赖于用你的精力、时间和劳动来换取金钱，你就受制于任何愿意为此付钱给你的人。这限制了自由。如果不说得太戏剧化的话，这是一种奴役。如果你总是过着月光族的生活来支付房贷或房租，你就没有选择。另一方面，如果工作是可选的——你就是一个很好的例子，你是一个非常成功的人。你做这个播客不是因为你需要钱。如果你还困在一份拿工资的工作中，你就没有选择做这个，因为你必须把所有时间都投入到那份工作中，这样你才能付房贷、付房租、把食物摆上桌。**金钱购买自由**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[JL Collins]**: Well, because as long as you are dependent on exchanging your effort, time, and labor for money, you are beholden to whoever is willing to pay you to do that. That's a limit of freedom. It's a it's a form of, without being too dramatic, a form of slavery. If you are always living paycheck to paycheck to pay the mortgage or the rent or whatever, if on the other hand, work is optional, you're a good example. and you've been a very successful guy. You're not doing this podcast because you need the money. If you were still stuck at a job that paid you a wage, you wouldn't have the option to do this because you'd have to devote all your time to that job so you could pay the mortgage, so you could pay the rent, so you could put food on the table. Money buys freedom.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 一个人如何摆脱那种境地？我以前在呼叫中心工作，接电话卖东西。在你看来，一个人如何现实地从那种受制于薪水的状态走出来？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Host]**: How does one get out of that situation? you know, if I I used to work in call centers um answering phones and selling people things. How does one in your view realistically get from that place where you are kind of beholden to the paycheck?

</details>

**[JL Collins]**: 很多人痴迷于 **[FU Money]** 这个概念。让我给你一个定义：FU Money 指的是一种财务状况，一个人有足够的钱过上舒适的生活而不需要工作，它给了你对任何你不愿忍受的人或事说“去你的”的自由，比如一份工作、一个老板或一个与你价值观不符的情况。这对你意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[JL Collins]**: So, a lot of people are obsessed with this idea of [FU Money]. Let me just give you a definition so FU money refers to a financial situation where a person has enough money to live comfortably without needing to work and it gives you the freedom to say f you to anyone or anything you don't want to tolerate such as a job a boss or a situation that doesn't align with your values what does that mean to you?

</details>

**[JL Collins]**: 对我来说，这是一个很好的定义，但我会用“财务独立”来替换那个定义。对我来说，FU Money 是你在通往财务独立的过程中积累的钱。比如，如果你是一个健美运动员，财务独立就是你站在舞台上获胜的时候，你处于精英水平。但在此过程中，从你开始锻炼的那一刻起，你就会变得强壮一点点。财务上也是一样。从你开始存钱并投资的那一刻起，你在财务上就变得强壮了一点。随着时间的推移，这种力量会不断积累。在我看来，那就是 FU Money，因为在你实现财务独立之前很久，那笔钱就给了你巨大的自由。你可能还不能永远不再工作，但如果需要的话，你可以离开一份有毒的工作，因为你知道你有那笔 FU Money，可以让你在寻找更好工作的过程中生存几个月甚至几年。所以，它允许你在那种情况下对雇主说“去你的”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[JL Collins]**: Yeah so for me so that's a good definition but I would substitute in that definition financial independence. FU money for me is the money you accumulate on the way, right? So, for instance, if you're a bodybuilder, you know, financial independence is when you're on the stage and you're winning, you're at the elite level. But along the way, from the moment you start working out, you get a little bit stronger, a little bit stronger, a little bit stronger, right? Same thing financially. The moment you start setting aside money and investing it, you become a little bit financially stronger. And that builds over time. That in my mind is the FU money because long before you're financially independent, that money gives you enormous freedom. You might not be able to never work again, but if you need to, you could leave a toxic job knowing you could survive for months or even years while you looked for the better job because you have that FU money. So it allows you to say f you in that case to an employer.

### 为什么买房可能是一个陷阱？

**[主持人]**: 如果你的女儿 Jessica 转身对你说：“爸爸，如果我想变得富有，有什么事是我绝对不该做的？” 如果我想在年轻时实现财务独立，你应该避免的更常见的建议是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Host]**: And if your daughter Jessica turns around to you and says, "Dad, what are what is something I should not do with my money if I um want to be wealthy? What is what are like the big what is the first thing that comes to mind to as a no no if I want to be financially wealthy?"

</details>

**[JL Collins]**: 你可能并不想去**买房**。这是一个非常有争议的观点。你想买房的原因是因为房子会大幅增加你的生活成本。你把资本投入到那座房子里，现在它不再是生钱的资产了，它只是闲置在那里。除了拥有房子，你还有维护它的费用、交税等等。如果你住在一个刚好能满足你需求的公寓里——顺便说一下，我女儿就是这么做的，而且一直在做——你的成本会更低。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[JL Collins]**: The mo more common advice that I think you should avoid if your goal is to become financially independent at a young age. You probably don't want to go buy a house. That's a very controversial thing to say. The reason you want buy a house is because houses dramatically inflate by and large your cost of living. You know, you're you're putting your capital into that house and now it's not going to be earning thing. It's sitting idally along with owning a house. You have the expenses of maintaining it, paying the taxes on it, blah blah blah. If you stay in a apartment that is just enough to meet your needs, which by the way is what my daughter has done and continues to do, your costs will be lower.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 解释一下，为什么买房会增加我的生活成本？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Host]**: Explain that to me. Explain why my cost of living goes up if I buy a house.

</details>

**[JL Collins]**: 当然。人们通常会买他们能负担得起的**最贵的房子**。整个行业都在推动他们这么做。如果你去找房地产经纪人，他们首先会问：“你赚多少钱？你想花多少钱？” 然后你去银行说：“我想买房，你能借我多少钱？” 银行会给出一个很大的数字。如果你遵循这些准则，你最终会得到一个负担。你不是从强势的地位购买它，你是在勉强购买。你借了银行愿意给你的最多的钱。银行希望你这么做，因为那是他们赚最多钱的方式，但这对你来说并不是最好的。而且当你买了那座房子，我不知道有谁（包括我自己在内）买了房子却不进行装修的。你还有这些成本。你会布置那座房子，因为你买的面积可能比你以前租的要大。你需要新家具，或者你只是想要更好的家具、新电器、园林绿化、税收、维护。清单是无穷无尽的。人们说：“房贷和租金是一样的。” 没错，但房贷只是起点。你还有所有这些其他的变动费用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[JL Collins]**: Sure. So people, it doesn't have to, but people people typically buy the most house they can possibly afford. The industry drives them that way. If you go to a real estate agent, you say, "I think I'm I want to buy a house." Right? First question they're going to ask you is, "How much do you make? How much do you want to spend?" You know, and and then you go to the bank and you say, "Okay, I want to buy a house. How much will you lend me?" And they'll say, "Well, how much you make?" And then they'll come back with the large number of how much they're willing to lend you. If you follow those guidelines, you're going to wind up with a house that's going to be a burden. You are not buying it from a position of strength. You are stretching to buy it. You are borrowing the most money a bank's willing to give you. You probably don't want to do that. I mean, you can, that's the bank wants you to do that cuz that's how they make the most money, but that's not the best thing for you to do. But that's what you get drawn into. And then when you buy that house, I don't know that I've ever known anybody, including me, by the way, and I've owned houses most of my adult life, who's owned a house without doing renovations on it. So, you've got those costs. You're going to furnish that house cuz you're probably buying more square footage than you were renting before. You're going to need new furniture, or maybe you just want better furniture for your new house, maybe new appliances, landscaping, taxes, maintenance. I mean, the the list is endless. And people say, "Well, you know, I can buy this house, and my mortgage is the same as my rent." Well, yeah, but your mortgage is just the starting point. You've got all these other expenses with the house. And the other thing is they are variable expenses.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 这是一个陷阱，不是吗？直到我买了一套房，我才意识到这一点。我甚至在这个播客里以此为生，但我还是犯了这个愚蠢的错误。回想起来，那是一个糟糕的决定。我在这座房子上花了这么多钱，而且每次我回去，看到的都是我需要改变的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Host]**: It is a bit of a trap, isn't it? It's a trap that um I didn't realize this until I bought a house and most people don't like I even sit here on this podcast doing this for a living and then I I made this stupid mistake of buying a house and I do think it was a stupid mistake because I we'll talk about opportunity cost in a second but I was in hindsight it was like a terrible decision. I spent all this money on this house. It was a house abroad. It was also like a holiday home I guess and every time I come all I see is things that I need to change.

</details>

**[JL Collins]**: 是的。以美国为例，如果你 20 或 30 年前在旧金山买房，你在财务上做得非常好。如果你在底特律买房，就没那么好了。那么问题来了，人们会说：“显然你不在底特律买房，你在旧金山买。” 我不是房地产专家，但我读到越来越多关于旧金山目前面临许多挑战的报道。另一方面，底特律正在经历复兴。谁能说 20、30 年后，人们不会说：“如果你在 2025 年买了底特律的房子，你就发财了。如果你买了旧金山的，嗯，就没那么好了。” 有时买房确实能带来惊人的回报，那是人们倾向于听到的故事，但并非总是如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[JL Collins]**: Yeah. It's looking at the United States for instance, if 20 years ago, 30 years ago, you'd bought a house in San Francisco, well, you've done very, very well financially. If you bought a house in Detroit, not so much. So then the question becomes, and people will say, well, obviously you don't buy a house in Detroit, you buy a house in San Francisco. Well, I'm not an expert in real estate, but I am reading more and more commonly that San Francisco is has a lot of very challenging problems at the moment. Detroit, on the other hand, where I was just visiting a couple of years ago, is enjoying a renaissance. Detroit's coming back. So, who's to say in 20, 30 years, people won't be saying, "If you bought in Detroit back in 2025, you were golden." And if you bought San Francisco, yeah, not so much. Sometimes real estate, buying a house can work out in a spectacular fashion. And that's the stories people tend to hear, but not always.

</details>

### 灵活性是年轻人的超级权力

**[主持人]**: 还有**灵活性**这一点，我们谈得不够多。即去另一个国家做其他事情的能力。我哥哥在我 20 岁时就跟我说过，他非常聪明，是个财务天才。他告诉我这是我能做的最糟糕的投资，他还让我考虑灵活性和随时搬走的能力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Host]**: This point of flexibility as well is one we don't talk about. Which is the ability to go do something else in another country. And my brother said this to me when I was 20. My brother's very smart. He's a year older than me, a financial genius, and has a much different brain to mine. And I remember when I was 20, maybe 24 and I was talking about do I buy a house and he both told me it was the worst investment I could ever make. But he also told me to think about flexibility and my ability to get up and move.

</details>

**[JL Collins]**: 没错。我同意你哥哥的观点。灵活性，尤其是当你年轻且职业生涯处于动态阶段时，是不容低估的。对于我女儿来说，她喜欢住在萨凡纳，但她有一个冒险的灵魂。她说：“我不知道。也许在某个时候我想去欧洲或其他地方居住。” 如果你有一座房子，这会使决定变得复杂。即使你幸运地买到了一个价值上涨的市场，买卖房屋相关的成本也是巨大的——房地产佣金、税收等等。进出房屋是一个昂贵的命题，而进出公寓几乎不需要任何费用。如果你在萨凡纳买了房，然后想去葡萄牙生活，现在你必须卖掉那座房子，或者你必须出租它。现在你成了一个“偶然的房东”，这是我第二本书的主题。那不是最优选择。所以灵活性极其重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[JL Collins]**: Exactly. Well, so I agree with everything you said. I agree I I agree with your brother. Flexibility, especially when you're young and your career is in a dynamic phase, it is not to be underrated. For my daughter, I mean, she loves living in Savannah. They've been there for 3 years, but she has an adventuresome soul. And you know, she said, "I don't know. I mean, maybe at some point I'll want to go live in Europe or somewhere else." Well, if you have a house, that complicates that decision. And even if you are fortunate enough to buy in a market where your values are rising, the cost associated with buying and selling of houses are enormous. the, you know, the real estate commission and the taxes and what have you. So, getting in and out of a house is an expensive proposition. Getting in and out of apartment doesn't cost anything. I mean, maybe your security deposit rate, but that's it. That's that's very clean and simple, but if you're if you were to buy a house in Savannah and then just say, you know, I think I want to go live in in Portugal, well, now you got to sell that house. Or maybe you have to rent it. Now you're a landlord. You're an accidental landlord, which was subject to my second book. You know, that's not optimal. I mean, if you set out to be a landlord, great. But if you become an accidental landlord because you can't sell your house that you don't want to live in anymore, that's not so much great. So flexibility is is enormously important.

</details>

### 债务：脚踝上的铅球

**[主持人]**: 如果我问你，财富的简单之路是什么？如果你必须用一句话回答，那会是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Host]**: If I were to ask you, what is the simple path to wealth? and you had to respond in a sentence, what would that sentence be?

</details>

**[JL Collins]**: **避免债务。量入为出。投资余钱。**

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[JL Collins]**: Avoid debt. Live on less than you earn. Invest a surplus.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 那么让我们谈谈债务。为什么你说要避免债务？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Host]**: So, let's talk about debt then. Why did you say avoid debt?

</details>

**[JL Collins]**: 如果你背负着债务，你永远无法实现财务独立。它是你拖着走的球和链子，尤其是消费贷。债务就像要求一个游泳运动员去比赛，却在他们的腰上绑了一个重物。如果你有债务，第一项工作就是把它彻底清除。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[JL Collins]**: You can never be financially independent if you're carrying around debt. It's a ball and chain that you drag drag along, especially consumer debt. Yeah, debt's a ball and chain. It's it's like asking a swimmer to compete and and strapping a weight around their waist. Uh it just is it possible? Well, sure. I guess it is, but it's a whole lot a whole lot more difficult. So, job one if you have debt is to blow it out.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 彻底清除债务对许多人来说是一个梦想，但说起来容易做起来难。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Host]**: And I mean, blowing it out is a dream for many, but it's uh easier said than done. I guess

</details>

**[JL Collins]**: 这仅仅意味着你必须组织你的生活，以便你可以拨出一些钱来购买你的自由（投资），或者如果你有债务，就用来偿还债务。你必须这么做。人们说：“我做不到。我需要这个，我需要住在那个社区，我们需要送孩子去那些学校。” 我称之为**“必需品”的暴政**。你生活中的“必需品”越多，你实现财务独立的机会就越小。对我来说，没有什么比我的自由更重要。这就是为什么从一开始，我就把收入的一半用于购买自由。这从来不是剥削。我花掉了每一分钱，只是我把其中一半花在了我最想拥有的东西上，那就是我的自由。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[JL Collins]**: It simply means that you have to organize your life in such a fashion that you can divert some money to either buying your freedom investments or if you have debt paying off that debt. You just you have to do that. And people say, "Well, I can't do that. You know, I I need to have this. I the you know, I need to have the these the two least luxury cars and we need to live in this neighborhood and we need to send the kids to these schools. We need to and I call that the tyranny of the must-haves. The more musthaves you have in your life, the less likely you are to become financially independent." Now, that's your choice. That's an individual's choice. It may very well be that those things are more important to you than buying your freedom. And it's your money. It's not for me to tell anybody how they should spend their money or what's important to me or what's important to them. For me, there was nothing I could spend my money on that was more important than my freedom. Which is why from the beginning, I diverted half of my income to buying that thing. Was never deprivation. Right? Most people say, "Oh, that's this is a path of deprivation. I can't spend my money." Well, not for me. I, you know, I spent every dime that ever came my way. It's just that I spent half of those dimes on the thing that I wanted to own the most, which was my freedom.

</details>

### 复利的力量与投资心态

**[主持人]**: 谈到复利，你谈到了一个人也许不应该打开包含报表的信封。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Host]**: You talked about compounding. You talked about how one should maybe not open the envelope that has the state.

</details>

**[JL Collins]**: 那是指数基金之父 **Jack Bogle** 说的，但我同意。如果你只是把钱放在一个能获得这种回报的地方，随着时间的推移，一切似乎都会迎刃而解。**复利**就像曲棍球棒。它平缓地运行很长一段时间，似乎什么都没发生，然后它开始缓慢增长，突然之间就直冲云霄。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[JL Collins]**: That's Jack Bogle has said that, but I agree with it. Yeah. It shows that if you just leave your money in a place where it's getting this kind of return over time, everything seems to take care of itself. So let me let me close the circle in a sense on on that subject because one of the things that I think gets overlooked with my book is this is the simple path to wealth. Which means if you follow it, you will become wealthy, right? So we go back to, you know, buying those things that people maybe want to buy, whether it's the fancy car or the or the house. Well, once you become wealthy, you can not only buy those things, but you're buying them from a position of power, right? You can easily afford them.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 投资股票现在安全吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Host]**: Is investing in stocks safe right now?

</details>

**[JL Collins]**: 这取决于你的时间跨度。股票是人类创造过的最强大、最有效的财富积累工具，但它们也非常波动。如果你看短期，股票永远不安全，因为它们在任何时刻都可能大幅下跌。但如果你放大到更长的时间段，股票是惊人地可靠。在 20 年的时间里，股票几乎总是能给你带来良好的回报。所以长期来看，股票极其安全且强大，但你必须能够忍受过程中的波动。如果你打算在市场下跌时恐慌性抛售，那么你就不应该投资股票。我的建议完全取决于在风暴期间将自己绑在桅杆上，忽略波动并继续投资，因为现在你实际上是在折价积累股份。风暴永远不会持续，阳光总会回来。

**[JL Collins]**: So depends on your time horizon so stocks are are the single most effective strongest wealth building tool that's ever been created but they are also very very volatile so when she says are stocks safe to invest in right now. What I hear is very shortterm thinking and stocks are never safe to invest in for the short term because they're volatile at any given moment. They can take a deep plunge and that's a perfectly natural part of the process. People get all create especially if you watch the news they people go insane and panicked. But crashes and pullbacks in the stock market are perfectly natural part of the process. They are very very difficult if not impossible to predict when they're going to happen. But that's the reason you never want to invest in stocks for money that you're going to need in the new near term. If you zoom out for longer periods of time, which is I re is what I recommend, stocks are stunningly reliable. I mean, there are very few times over the course of 10 years where stocks have not given you a good return. and you go out 20 years and I I mean it's very rare. So if you look long-term stocks are extremely safe and extremely powerful in building in building wealth, but they are very volatile along the way. So you have to be willing and able to endure that volatility. If you're going to panic and sell when the market drops, not if because the market will drop. It's a perfectly natural part of the process. If you're going to panic and sell when that happens, you do not want to invest in stocks because they will leave you bleeding on the side of the road.

### 指数基金：自我净化的机器

**[主持人]**: 对于普通人来说，他们应该把钱投到哪里？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Host]**: For the average person, what what should they be putting their money into with everything you see happening in the world?

</details>

**[JL Collins]**: 我提倡投资于**广泛的、低成本的股票指数基金**。一个例子是 **VTSAX**，它是先锋集团（Vanguard）的总股票市场指数基金。它投资于美国几乎每一家上市公司，大约 3,600 家公司。这意味着从工厂员工到首席执行官，每个人都在努力让我变得更富有。有些公司会做得非常好，因为这个基金是按市值加权的，公司越成功，我拥有的就越多。如果一家公司衰落了，它就会漂走。但我没关系，因为无论新的竞争对手是谁，我都不需要预测它是谁，我都会拥有它们。我把这个过程称为**“自我净化”**（Self-cleansing）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[JL Collins]**: I'm an advocate of investing in broad-based lowcost stock index funds. What is that? That is an example of that is VTSAX which is Vanguard's total stock market index fund. It invests in virtually every publicly traded company in the United States of America. That's very the number of those varies, but it's roughly 3,600 companies. So you're basically investing in America. And that means everybody from the factory floor to the CEO is working to make me richer. Now, some of those companies are going to do extraordinarily well and they're going to succeed dramatically. And because this fund, as most funds like it are, is cap weighted and I'll explain that in a minute. The more successful the company is, the more of it I will own. So cap weighted simply means that the largest larger the market capitalization of the company is the valuation right the market capital the larger that is the greater the percentage of the fund it will represent. Right now, if one of those companies falters and starts failing on their execution or a more aggressive, better organized competitor comes along and displaces them, then they will drift away. But I'm okay with that because whatever that new competitor is, I don't have to predict who it is. I will own them. And that's a process that I refer to as self-cleansing.

**[主持人]**: 就像西尔斯百货（Sears）曾经统治了 100 年，但后来被沃尔玛和亚马逊取代了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Host]**: Like Sears dominated for 100 years, but then it was replaced by Walmart and Amazon.

</details>

**[JL Collins]**: 没错。如果我当年买了西尔斯的个股，我就得考虑什么时候卖掉它，以及买什么来替代它。我得考虑杰夫·贝佐斯是不是个疯子。但我拥有指数基金，我就不需要考虑这些。如果贝佐斯的“疯狂”实际上是天才，他就会升到顶部，我就会从中受益。如果那只是疯狂，他就会消失，这也没关系，因为无论什么成功，我都会拥有并受益。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[JL Collins]**: Exactly. I don't have to do anything. I just have to own it and I can own it forever. So, if I went and I bought Sears stock as an example back in the day, well, whenever you own an individual stock, you're going to be thinking about, okay, how long am I going to own this? And what is going to trigger my sale of this particular asset? I don't have to think about any of that owning the index because if Jeff Bezos turns out that his wackiness is brilliance, which it turns out it was, then he's going to rise to the top, which it turns out Amazon did, and I benefited from that. If it turns out it was just wackiness, it would have just faded away as a lot of companies have. But that wouldn't have mattered cuz whatever succeeds, I will I will own and benefit from.

### 75 岁的人生智慧与遗憾

**[主持人]**: 你 75 岁了，你拥有我还没有的回顾性的清晰。到底什么才是重要的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Host]**: You said you're 75. You have the the wisdom of hindsight. What actually matters?

</details>

**[JL Collins]**: 最终，没有什么真正重要。这有点像问生命的意义是什么。我不认为生命有意义，当你观察宇宙和宇宙的规模时。认为我们作为个体承载着某种意义的想法对我来说似乎很愚蠢。人类已经存在了大约 20 万或 30 万年，在已经发生和未来将要发生的时间里，这只是一个微不足道的污点。如果你度过一生，对待别人还不错，过得还算顺遂，我认为你就做得很好。但我并不认为其中有什么深奥的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[JL Collins]**: Nothing. Nothing really matters ultimately. Yeah. I think that's kind of like asking what's the meaning of life, right? And I don't think there is a meaning to life when you look at the scale of the universe, the scale of the cosmos. The concept that we as individuals bear some meaning seems to me to be silly. Human beings have been around for I don't know two 300,000 years depending on when you define homo sapiens. I mean that's that's a infantestibly small smudge of time in that has happened already and that will happen in the future even if humans last for another few million years. It will be an infinitely tiny bit of time against this huge cosmic universe and our individuality within that is infantessimally small and I think there's some great meaning behind that seems to be to be the height of arrogance. So I think that if you go through life and you treat people pretty well and you have a a pretty good good run of it, I think you've done well. I don't but I don't think there's something profound in that.

**[主持人]**: 那么重点是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Host]**: So what is the point then? Is there a point?

</details>

**[JL Collins]**: 没有重点。重点是我们碰巧在这里，这可以是一次有趣的旅程，也可以是一次艰难的旅程，取决于你如何对待它，以及在某些情况下取决于你的环境。你、我和绝大多数听我们说话的人，可能对我们如何创造自己的生活有更多的自主权。它会有伟大的意义吗？不，最终不会。但这是你拥有的唯一生命，你最好充分利用它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[JL Collins]**: There is no point. I mean the the point is we happen to be here and it can be a good fun ride. It can be a very difficult ride depending on what you make of it and in some cases depending on your circumstances. You and I and the vast majority of people listening to us, probably I venture to say 100% of them have a lot more autonomy over over how we can make our life. And will it have great meaning? No, ultimately not. But it's the only life you have and you may as well make the best of it.
