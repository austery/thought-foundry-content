title: 特朗普政府的紧急权力、司法危机与多重挑战
---

### 特朗普政府的紧急权力与司法危机

联邦上诉法院已为特朗普政府在俄勒冈州波特兰部署国民警卫队扫清了障碍，尽管该州州长对此表示反对。此前，波特兰当地一个**ICE**（Immigration and Customs Enforcement: 移民和海关执法局）设施外持续数月的抗议活动，促使特朗普总统声称该市需要受到保护，免受“国内恐怖分子”的侵害。本月初，一名下级法院法官曾阻止了国民警卫队的部署，称特朗普对局势的描述“完全脱离事实”。

<details>

<p class="english-text">A federal appeals court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops in Portland, Oregon, over the objections of the state's governor. Months of protests outside an ICE facility there led President Trump to say the city needed to be protected from domestic terrorists. A lower court judge blocked the guard deployment earlier this month, calling Trump's portrayal of the situation simply untethered to the facts.</p>
</details>

但在最新的裁决中，上诉法院法官列举了多起示威者投掷石块和棍棒、试图在ICE大楼纵火或向警官发射彩弹的事件。其中一位法官写道，这足以支持部署决定，并引用道：“即使总统可能在社交媒体上夸大问题的严重性。”该州律师已提出上诉，因此法律纠纷很可能会继续。与此同时，关于总统能否单方面向美国城市派兵的争议也在伊利诺伊州持续发酵。那里的部署目前已被阻止，但特朗普政府现已要求最高法院紧急介入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But in the latest ruling, appeals court judges cited a number of instances where demonstrators had thrown rocks and sticks, attempted to set fires at the ICE building, or shot paintballs at officers. One judge wrote that that was enough to support the deployment decision. Quote, even if the president may exaggerate the extent of the problem on social media, lawyers for the state have already pushed for an appeal. So the legal wrangling is likely to continue. Meanwhile, the fight over whether the president can unilaterally send troops into US cities is also still playing out in Illinois. Deployments there are currently blocked, but the Trump administration has now asked the Supreme Court to weigh in on an emergency basis.</p>
</details>

特朗普上任仅九个月，其政府提出的紧急上诉数量已超过拜登白宫四年间的总和，并且最高法院几乎每次都站在特朗普政府一边。这些裁决有时被称为“**影子议程**”（shadow docket: 美国最高法院在不进行全面听证或提供详细解释的情况下发布的紧急裁决）的一部分，它们通常很少或根本不提供最高法院裁决的解释。尽管这些命令在技术上是临时性的，但它们已允许特朗普采取重大行动，例如驱逐数万人或大幅削减政府开支，而且同样地，法官们往往很少或根本不提供解释。《纽约时报》发现，对于许多下级法院法官来说，这令人困惑和沮丧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just 9 months into Trump's term, his administration has made more of those emergency appeals than the Biden White House made in four years. and the Supreme Court has sided with the Trump administration nearly every single time. The rulings, which are part of what's sometimes called the shadow docket, frequently offer little or no explanation for the Supreme Court's decision. And while the orders are technically temporary, they've allowed Trump to take significant actions like deporting tens of thousands of people or slashing government spending, again, often with little or no explanation from the justices. The Times has found that for many lower court judges that's been confusing and frustrating.</p>
</details>

>> 我们开始思考，这种沮丧情绪到底有多普遍？于是，我们决定开始逐一联系法官，尽可能多地联系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> We started to wonder, well, can we get a sense of just how widespread these frustrations are? And so, we decided to just start reaching out to judges, as many as we could, one by one.</p>
</details>

《纽约时报》的法院记者马塔蒂·施瓦茨（Matathi Schwarz）向数百名联邦法官发送了一份关于大量紧急裁决的问卷。其中一些法官匿名回复并与马特交谈，称这些命令“令人不安”且“是一种侮辱”。一位法官表示，法院正处于“司法危机”之中。在这些对话中，一个突出的问题是，在巨大的时间压力下撰写六七十页意见的地区法院法官们，在看到这些意见被没有给出理由的紧急命令草率推翻后，感到多么士气低落。我认为这些法官有一部分人真的希望最高法院能够认真对待他们的说法，认真对待他们对法律的解释。在回复问卷的65位法官中，有42位表示，自特朗普总统重返白宫以来，最高法院使用紧急议程的做法已在一定程度上损害了公众对司法机构的看法。这是一个非常非常严重的声明。他们说最高法院正在损害公众眼中整个法院系统的形象，而他们往往是必须处理这一问题的人，因为他们身处前线。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Matathi Schwarz covers the courts for the Times. He sent out a questionnaire to hundreds of federal judges about the flood of emergency rulings. and some of them responded and spoke with Matt on the condition of anonymity, calling the orders troubling and a slap in the face. One said that the courts were in the midst of a judicial crisis. One thing that came across in some of these conversations is how demoralizing the last few months have been for district court judges writing these 60 70 page opinions under intense time pressure and then to see them summarily reversed by emergency orders that provide no reasoning. I think there's a part of these judges that really wants to see the Supreme Court engage with what they're saying and engage with their interpretation of the law. And 42 of the 65 judges who responded to our questionnaire said they felt that the Supreme Court's use of the emergency docket had caused some degree of harm to the public's perception of judiciary since President Trump returned to office. And that is a a really really serious statement. They're saying the Supreme Court is hurting the courts as a whole in the eyes of the public and they're the ones often who have to deal with that because they're the ones on the front lines.</p>

### 中东和平协议的脆弱性

今天早上，**空军二号**（Air Force 2: 美国副总统的专机）降落在以色列，副总统J.D.万斯（JD Vance）抵达，试图维系以色列和哈马斯之间脆弱的和平协议。他的访问正值多位政府官员向《纽约时报》透露，白宫越来越担心以色列总理本雅明·内塔尼亚胡（Benjamin Netanyahu）可能会废除协议，并在加沙恢复全面进攻。仅仅一周前，特朗普本人还在以色列庆祝美国斡旋的结束战争协议的第一阶段。但在最近几天暴力事件爆发后，内塔尼亚胡强硬政府的成员呼吁以色列重新发动进攻，并称要“全力以赴”。当你谈论哈马斯时，你谈论的是40个不同的分支。它们是脱节的。其中一些分支可能会遵守停火协议，但许多分支不会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This morning, Air Force 2 touched down in Israel as Vice President JD Vance arrived to try and hold together the fragile peace deal between Israel and Hamas. His visit comes as several administration officials tell the Times there's growing concern in the White House that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could dismantle the agreement and resume an all-out assault in Gaza. Just a week ago, Trump himself was in Israel to celebrate the first phase of the US broker deal to end the war. But after a flare up in violence in recent days, members of Netanyahu's hardline government called for the Israeli offensive to restart, quote, at full strength is there. I when you talk about Hamas, you're talking about 40 different cells. It's disjointed. Some of those cells will probably honor the ceasefire. Many of those cells will not.</p>
</details>

在启程前，万斯承认尽管停火，一些战斗仍可能继续，暗示即使是最好的情况，以色列和哈马斯之间也可能出现他所描述的“时断时续”的冲突，而哈马斯迄今拒绝放下武器。在我们能够确保哈马斯妥善解除武装之前，我们需要一些海湾阿拉伯国家派遣部队进入该地区，以实际执行一些法律和秩序，并在当地维持安全。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ahead of his trip, Vance acknowledged that some fighting was likely to continue despite the ceasefire, suggesting even a best-case scenario would involve what he described as fits and starts between Israel and Hamas, which has so far refused to lay down its weapons. We before we actually can ensure that Hamas is properly disarmed, that's going to require, as we know, some of these Gulf Arab states to get forces in there to actually apply some some law and order and some security keeping on the ground.</p>
</details>

根据当前停火下一阶段的提案，一支由多国部队组成的国际稳定部队将进入加沙，以确保该地区安全并促进援助分发等。但这支部队具体会是什么样子，是正在进行的谈判中的众多症结之一。一些被视为可能参与的国家表示，出于担心其士兵可能面临危险或被视为占领者，他们暂时不会派遣部队。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Under the current proposal for the next phase of the ceasefire, an international stabilization force made up of troops from various countries would come into Gaza to secure the territory and facilitate aid distribution among other things. But what exactly that force might look like is one of many sticking points in the ongoing negotiations with some of the countries seen as likely participants saying they won't commit troops just yet out of concern that their soldiers could be in danger or that they could be seen as occupiers of the territory.</p>

### 政府停摆与大学对特朗普提案的抵制

现在，关于特朗普政府还有三项快速更新。交通部长肖恩·达菲（Shawn Duffy）警告称，由于政府停摆，全国的空中交通管制员将收到零薪水的支票，美国旅客可能会感受到影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, three other quick updates on the Trump administration. The Secretary of Transportation Shawn Duffy is warning that the nation's air traffic controllers are about to get paychecks for zero dollars because of the government shutdown and that American travelers could feel the effects.</p>
</details>

>> 我认为你可能会看到的是旅行中出现更多中断，因为他们中更多的人会考虑：“我如何弥补没有到账的支票和我养家糊口之间的差距？”我们听说他们正在做优步（Uber）司机的工作，他们正在做DoorDash（外卖平台）的工作，想方设法维持家庭生计。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think what you might see is more disruptions in travel as more of them look to say, "How do I bridge the gap between the check that's not coming and putting food on my table?" And we've heard they're taking Uber jobs. They're uh doing door dash, figuring out ways to uh keep their families afloat.</p>
</details>

白宫此前曾表示，可能会设法调拨联邦资金来支付管制员的薪水，就像他们为现役部队重新分配五角大楼资金一样，但达菲昨天表示，目前没有这样的计划。这无疑会增加管制员们已经面临的压力，他们中许多人正在加班以弥补严重的人员短缺。政府目前已停摆20天，**国会山**（Capitol Hill: 美国国会所在地，代指美国立法机构）的议员们在达成重开政府协议方面没有任何进展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The White House had previously suggested it might find ways to shift federal dollars around to keep the controllers paid in the same way they've repurposed Pentagon funds for active duty troops, but Duffy said yesterday that there's no current plan to do that. That is set to add to the stress the controllers are already facing with many of them pulling overtime shifts to make up for severe staffing shortages. The government has now been shut down for 20 days and lawmakers on Capitol Hill are no closer to reaching an agreement to reopen it.</p>
</details>

此外，截至昨晚，白宫试图让九所大学签署一项所谓的“契约”，以引导它们优先考虑总统的政策，但其中除两所外，所有大学都拒绝了这项提议。政府曾建议，如果这些学校同意诸如“学术自由并非绝对”等声明，并承诺可能关闭政府声称惩罚或贬低保守思想的机构部分，它们就可以优先获得联邦资金。虽然德克萨斯大学（University of Texas）表示愿意签署，但包括布朗大学（Brown）、达特茅斯学院（Dartmouth）、南加州大学（USC）、弗吉尼亚大学（UVA）和亚利桑那大学（University of Arizona）在内的其他学校现已明确表示不会签署。亚利桑那大学校长写道：“学术自由、基于绩效的研究资助和机构独立性等原则是基础性的，必须得到维护。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Also, as of last night, all but two of the nine universities the White House tried to get to sign a so-called compact to steer them towards the president's priorities have rejected the proposal. The administration had suggested the schools could get preferential access to federal funds if they agreed to statements like academic freedom is not absolute and pledged to potentially shut down parts of their institutions that the administration claims punish or belittle conservative ideas. While the University of Texas suggested it's open to signing on, other schools including Brown, Dartmouth, USC, UVA, and the University of Arizona have now said explicitly that they won't. With Arizona's president writing, quote, "Principles like academic freedom, merit-based research funding, and institutional independence are foundational and must be preserved."</p>
</details>

### 白宫东翼改造与伦理争议

昨天在白宫，施工人员拆除了**东翼**（East Wing: 白宫的东侧建筑，包含办公室和游客入口）的一部分，为特朗普总统9万平方英尺的国宴厅腾出空间。他说，这些翻修是举办国宴等活动所必需的，这些活动以前都是在白宫草坪上的帐篷下举行的。总的来说，这个宴会厅预计将耗资超过2亿美元。上周，特朗普为数十位同意帮助支付费用的富裕捐助者举办了一场奢华晚宴。来自亚马逊（Amazon）、苹果（Apple）、谷歌（Google）、微软（Microsoft）和其他公司的代表出席了晚宴，导致一些伦理监督机构指控该项目基本上是一种“付费换取青睐”的方案，以讨好总统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And at the White House yesterday, construction crews demolished part of the East Wing to clear the way for President Trump's 90,000 square foot state ballroom. He said the renovations are necessary to be able to host things like state dinners, which have previously been held under tents on the White House lawn. In all, the ballroom is expected to cost more than $200 million. And last week, Trump hosted a lavish dinner for dozens of wealthy donors who've agreed to help cover the costs. Representatives from Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and other companies attended, leading some ethics watchd dogs to allege that the project is basically a pay-to-play scheme to curry favor with the president.</p>

### 花生过敏研究新进展

一项新研究发现，在出台关于何时让婴儿接触花生食物的新指南后，美国儿童的花生过敏率显著下降。几十年来，专家们一直建议父母避免让婴儿接触常见的过敏原。但研究表明，让婴儿尝试花生可以降低他们患过敏症的几率后，建议发生了改变。从2017年开始，国家指南正式推荐了早期引入的方法。发表在《儿科学》（Pediatrics）杂志上的这项新研究表明，在改变后的几年里，三岁以下儿童的花生过敏率骤降了43%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A new study has found that the rate of peanut allergies in American children dropped significantly after new guidelines were put out about when to introduce babies to the food. For decades, experts recommended that parents avoid exposing their babies to common allergens. But after research showed that letting babies try peanuts could cut their chances of developing an allergy, the recommendations changed. Starting in 2017, national guidelines formally recommended the early introduction approach. The new study published in the journal Pediatrics shows that in the years after the switch, peanut allergies in children under three plummeted 43%.</p>
</details>

这项研究没有调查孩子们吃了什么，因此它没有显示出指南的改变直接导致了下降。尽管如此，专家们表示这些数据令人鼓舞。花生过敏可能是致命的，而且大多数患有花生过敏的儿童从未摆脱过敏。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The study didn't look at what the kids ate, so it doesn't show that the changed guidelines directly caused the decline. Still, experts say the data is promising. Peanut allergies can be lethal, and the majority of kids who have them never outgrow them.</p>

### 宇宙起源的探索者：乔治·斯穆特

最后，回到1992年4月，《纽约时报》头版刊登了一篇文章，标题是“科学家报告了关于时间如何开始的深刻见解”。现在，《纽约时报》正在纪念对这一发现至关重要的诺贝尔奖得主物理学家乔治·斯穆特（George Smoot）。他最近去世，享年80岁。斯穆特领导的团队帮助证实了宇宙大爆炸是宇宙的起源。他们通过测量太空中光线温度的微小变化，即**宇宙微波背景辐射**（cosmic microwave background: 宇宙大爆炸后遗留的辐射）来做到这一点。史蒂芬·霍金（Steven Hawking）称其为“本世纪最伟大的发现，如果不是有史以来最伟大的发现”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And finally, back in April 1992, the Times ran a front page article with the headline, "Scientists report profound insight on how time began." Now, the Times is remembering the Nobel Prize winning physicist integral to that discovery, George Smoot. He died recently at age 80. Smoot led a team that helped confirm that the big bang was the source of the universe. They did it by measuring tiny variations in the temperature of light in space known as the cosmic microwave background. Steven Hawking called it the greatest discovery of the century, if not of all time.</p>
</details>

斯穆特因其工作获得了诺贝尔奖。尽管在他的职业生涯中，他的一些同事曾提出担忧，认为他并未总是将应得的荣誉归功于其他参与研究的人。所以，我在想你三年前获得了诺贝尔奖。那么，你一定处理了很多关于斯穆特最近做了什么的问题。
