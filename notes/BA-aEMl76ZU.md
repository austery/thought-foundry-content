title: 《速度与激情》系列如何重塑好莱坞：一部电影传奇的幕后故事
---

### 《速度与激情》的缘起与作者的创作动机

主持人：巴里·赫兹，欢迎来到《Rundown》节目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Barry Herz, welcome to the rundown.</p>
</details>

Barry：哦，谢谢邀请我。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, thank you for having me.</p>
</details>

主持人：你是什么时候开始对《速度与激情》系列感兴趣的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When did you become interested in the Fast and Furious?</p>
</details>

Barry：我想最初的兴趣火花是在2001年，当时我还是个青少年电影院员工。在那个夏天，我大概累计看了第一部电影15到20次，每次都是零散的片段拼凑起来的，我真的很喜欢它。即使小时候，我也一直是个**电影爱好者**（tent kind of moviegoer），我喜欢**商业大片**（blockbusters），也喜欢**艺术电影**（art house），喜欢外国电影，喜欢**独立电影**（indie）。而《速度与激情》系列中的飞车、酷男、辣妹、劫案等元素，一切都恰到好处，我就这样一直追随这个系列。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the first uh flicker of interest was when I was a teenage movie theater worker um back in 2001. Over the course of that summer, I probably saw the first one 15 20 times cumulatively in little chunks stitched together and I just really kind of dug it. I was always a big tent kind of movie go even as a kid. I like blockbusters. I like art house. I like foreign language. I like indie. And something about, you know, Fast Cars, Cool Guys, Hot Women, Heists, it all kind of clicked and uh I just kind of kept going with the series.</p>
</details>

主持人：那么，你为什么想写一本关于它的书呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, why did you want to write a book about it?</p>
</details>

Barry：嗯，我一直在想，作为一名影评人、作家和记者，我一直想写一本关于电影行业的书。我当时很苦恼，因为所有那些大片似乎都已经有书写过了，比如你可以找到一百万本关于《教父》的书，一百万本关于斯皮尔伯格的书。但后来我开始想，没有人写过《速度与激情》。我越想越觉得这个系列有一个非常有趣的**发展轨迹**（arc）。它不仅展示了系列本身如何从一部带有三人行笑话的街头赛车小电影，演变为一部征服世界的间谍动作大片，而且幕后的戏剧性事件也同样引人入胜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I was thinking always wanted to kind of write some kind of book about the film industry being eventually becoming a critic and a writer and a journalist and I was struggling to think it was like all the kind of movies the big movies had books about, you know, you can find a million books about the Godfather, a million books about Spielberg. Um, but then I started thinking I was like, well, you know what, no one's ever written about fast before. And the more I thought about it, the more I realized there's quite an interesting arc to it. Um, it's not only this how the series evolved itself from this like little piddly street racing movie with threesome jokes into like this worldconquering spy actionfilled blockbuster, but the offscreen drama of it all was fascinating, too.</p>
</details>

### 好莱坞制片厂的合作与挑战

主持人：你从环球影业那里得到过任何帮助吗？环球影业是制作《速度与激情》系列电影的制片厂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Did you get any help from Universal? That's the studio that makes the Fast and the Furious movies.</p>
</details>

Barry：嗯，简短的回答是没有。我当时把书卖给我的出版商时说：“我没有和那边任何人谈过这本书的事。没有得到任何预先的许可或类似的东西，但我相信我能写出一些有趣的东西，无论他们是否合作。”然后，一旦合同签了，我首先联系的就是环球影业的代表。我去了洛杉矶，和他们的两位副总裁及公关人员进行了一次非常友好但高效的午餐。他们基本上说：“祝你好运，但我们不会合作。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, the short answer is no. Um, I kind of sold the book to my publisher. I said, "I have not talked to anybody over there about this. Got no advanced permission or anything like that, but I'm sure I can deliver something interesting whether that happens or not." And then once that deal was signed, I first people I went to were the Universal reps. I went down to LA for a very uh friendly but um efficient lunch with two of their uh VPs and comms. and they basically said, "Go with God, but we're not cooperating."</p>
</details>

主持人：你认为这是为什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why do you think that is?</p>
</details>

Barry：我想部分原因是因为这个**电影系列**（franchise）仍然非常活跃。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think partially because it's a franchise that is still very much in motion.</p>
</details>

主持人：它不是那种已经安稳地躺在他们片库里的电影，他们会乐于任何形式的回顾来提升人们对那部**片库影片**（library title）的兴趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's not something that is just sitting nicely in their catalog that they'd love any kind of retrospective on would help, you know, boost interest in that library title.</p>
</details>

Barry：它是一个正在进行中的项目，对他们来说也是一个棘手的问题，因为2023年的上一部电影《速度与激情10》（Fast X）虽然在全球获得了超过7亿美元的票房，但对于这部电影的成本以及环球影业的预期票房来说，这远远不够。在某种程度上，这仍然是他们持续的**难题**（headache）。所以，我这样一个不知名的加拿大记者，为什么要让我参与进来呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's very much a going concern and it's a tricky concern for them because the last film uh Fast X in 2023 while it made like upwards of 700 million globally that was not quite enough for how much that film cost and how much Universal was expecting it to gross and it's an ongoing kind of headache for them in a way. So here I am like an unknown Canadian journalist and why introduce me into the mix for for anything.</p>
</details>

### 谁是《速度与激情》的真正“作者”？

主持人：那么，《速度与激情》的真正**作者**（authored）是谁？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Who actually authored The Fast and the Furious?</p>
</details>

Barry：嗯，我觉得任何成功背后，你都会发现有无数不同的作者想要居功。我的意思是，这一切都始于一个非常容易被遗忘的**知识产权**（intellectual property: 指智力劳动成果的专有权利），那是一篇1998年由纽约作家肯尼斯·李（Kenneth Lee）为《Vibe》杂志撰写的文章。肯尼斯·李当时是一名**小报记者**（tabloid journalist），报道城市犯罪，他偶然发现了皇后区街头赛车手的**亚文化**（subculture）。他为《Vibe》写了一篇文章，这篇文章传到了环球影业的高管手中，他们**买下了版权**（optioned it: 指购买作品的影视改编权）。然后，在**编剧署名**（screenwriter credits: 指电影剧本作者的署名权）方面就变得非常复杂，因为这个想法和提案经过了数十人之手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I feel like with any success, you find there's like a million different authors who want to take credit for it. I mean, it all starts with a very forgotten piece of intellectual property, which is a 1998 Vibe magazine article by a New York writer called Kenneth Lee. Uh, and Kenley was a tabloid journalist at the time writing about crime in the city and he happened upon this subculture of street racers out in Queens basically. Uh, he wrote an article about it for Vibe and that article made its way to Universal executives who optioned it. And then you get really tricky in terms of what the screenwriter credits are because it's that idea and pitch went through upwards of dozens of people.</p>
</details>

主持人：所以不是一个人，是很多人？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there isn't like one person. It's it's multiple</p>
</details>

Barry：是很多人。我觉得如果你必须把它缩小范围，并且和最早参与其中的大多数人交谈，你会发现两位编剧比较突出。一位是大卫·艾亚（David Ayer），他后来取得了相当大的成功。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it's multiple people. I feel if you had to kind of narrow it down and you talk with most of the people who were involved at the earliest stages, you would find two writers who kind of stand out. Um, one is David Ayer, um, who has gone on to be quite successful</p>
</details>

主持人：另一位是加里·斯科特·汤普森（Gary Scott Thompson），他在整个系列中一直保留着角色的版权或说署名权。所以你看到的每一部续集，都会看到“根据加里·斯科特·汤普森创作的角色改编”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and the other is Gary Scott Thompson, um, who has really maintained the rights or the credit rather to the characters throughout the whole franchise. So any of all the sequels you see, you will see based on characters created by Gary Scott Thompson there.</p>
</details>

主持人：我的意思是，漫威有凯文·费奇（Kevin Feige），DC有詹姆斯·古恩（James Gunn）。《速度与激情》系列没有这样一位**创意总监**（creative architect: 指负责系列整体创意方向和规划的人）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, Marvel has like Kevin Feige and DC has James Gunn. There isn't like that for the Fast and the Fierce franchise.</p>
</details>

Barry：没有这样一位贯穿始终的创意总监。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's no like creative architect who has been involved across the whole thing.</p>
</details>

Barry：我想说，这个系列几乎一直都有同一位**制片人**（producer: 电影制作的负责人，负责项目整体运作），那就是尼尔·H·莫里茨（Neil H. Maritz）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would say um it has had uh the same producer almost the whole way through which is Neil H. Maritz.</p>
</details>

Barry：他是好莱坞历史上最成功的制片人之一，即使很多人不知道他的名字。但他从一开始就在那里。制片人的工作多种多样，在不同的电影中定义也不同。所以，他会是那个稳定的力量。但就整体的**幕后主脑**（mastermind）而言，它经历了很多不同的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um one of the most successful producers in Hollywood history even if a lot of people don't know his name. Um but he was there at the very beginning. The job of a producer is varied and can be defined differently from film to film. So, he'd be the one stabilizing force there. But in terms of like overall mastermind, it's gone through a lot of different hands.</p>
</details>

### 《速度与激情》对好莱坞的深远影响

主持人：在过去20多年里，《速度与激情》系列对好莱坞有多重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How how important is the Fast and the Furious franchise to say the last 20 plus years of Hollywood?</p>
</details>

Barry：我想如果你深入思考，明年它就将迎来25周年了，这既令人瞩目又有些荒谬。它确实反映了过去25年好莱坞的整体发展。我们看到电影制作人越来越依赖这种**互联的电影宇宙**（connected cinematic universes: 指一系列共享故事背景和角色的电影作品），一部电影引出另一部，不同时间线中的角色也会突然出现，从而提升观众的兴趣，让你愿意追随这场冒险。我的意思是，《速度与激情》系列在这方面确实走在前沿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think if you were really to think about it deeply, it will be a quarter century old next year. um which is kind of remarkable and preposterous at the same time. Um really do mirror the past 25 years of Hollywood in general. Um we've seen filmmakers increasingly rely on these kind of connected cinematic universes where one film leads to another and characters from a different kind of almost timeline pop in uh so that it boosts audience interest and makes you tag along for the adventure. I mean, FastT was really at the forefront of that.</p>
</details>

Barry：我们看到了很多努力，旨在触及更广泛、更多元化的受众。而《速度与激情》在“多元化”这个词成为电影公司**流行词**（watch word）之前，就已经自然而然地做到了这一点。我们也看到了国际市场的巨大扩张，很多电影都积极吸引中国市场、南美市场，确保这些电影在北美市场之外也能获得更多收入，而它们过去通常被局限于北美市场。在这一点上，《速度与激情》系列可以说比任何人都做得早。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We've seen a lot of efforts to reach wider, more diverse audiences. Um, and Fast was doing that organically, naturally before even d the word diverse was kind of like a studio watch word. And we've seen a lot of uh expansion into international markets. you know, a lot of appealing to the Chinese market, appealing to South America, making sure that these films get more money outside of the North American circuit that they were typically locked into. And Fast was doing that before really anybody.</p>
</details>

### 多元化与“家庭”主题的成功秘诀

主持人：当你观看这些电影时，它们确实非常多元化。这是偶然还是刻意为之？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When you watch the movie, they are incredibly diverse. Was that was that by accident or was that by design?</p>
</details>

Barry：这取决于你和谁交谈。当你深入了解第一部电影的起源时，我觉得大多数人认为这是**皆大欢喜的刻意设计**（happy design）。他们当时在讨论，试图重现那种亚文化，编剧大卫·艾亚和导演罗伯·科恩（Rob Cohen）对南加州进行了深入研究，他们发现那里有很多拉丁裔、亚裔、黑人、混血儿，各种背景的人都有。肤色并不重要，重要的是你的引擎有多大。所以，他们在第一部电影的选角上非常**刻意**（deliberately），以反映这种文化，并尽可能保持真实。后来随着电影的规模越来越大，就不再是刻意针对不同**人口统计学群体**（demographics: 指按年龄、性别、种族等划分的人口统计特征）了，而更像是：“好吧，我们有这些人，我们觉得谁能在银幕上很好地合作，然后我们就打造出这样一支‘贝纳通联合色彩’（United Colors of Benetton: 意大利服装品牌，以多元化广告著称）的超级团队。”这恰好自然地吸引了不同的市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kind of depends on who you talk to. Um when you uh get into the origins of the first film, I feel most people are of the mind that it was by happy design. Um, they were talking about they were trying to recreate this subculture in which, you know, the writer David Ayer and the director Rob Cohen did some heavy research into into Southern California and they found that it was very much Latinos, it was Asian kids, it was black kids, it was mixed kids, it was everybody was kind of it didn't matter the color of your skin so much as the size of your engine. Um, and so they cast that first film very deliberately to reflect that culture and to try to stay as authentic as they could. And then as the films got bigger, it wasn't necessarily so much about appealing to um, Prasly targeting different demographics as more so like, okay, here's the people we have and here's who we could think work well together on screen and let's just build up this kind of United Colors of Beniton super team. um that happen to just you know naturally appeal to different marketplaces</p>
</details>

主持人：范·迪塞尔（Vin Diesel）在种族上，当你观看这些电影时，他几乎可以是任何种族。我的意思是，他的背景，我真的搞不清楚他的实际种族是什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and Vin Diesel he's racially he could be anything almost when you watch these movies I mean his his background like okay I I couldn't really figure out what his actual ethnics</p>
</details>

Barry：我的意思是，在整个系列中，我们了解到他有点意大利血统，他有古巴血统，他在古巴有家人，到第七部电影时他能说一口流利的西班牙语。是的，这很大程度上反映了迪塞尔自己精心塑造的**人设**（persona）。他一直以来在种族上是**模糊不清的**（ethnically ambiguous: 指其种族背景不明确，可以被不同族群认同），这使得他能够轻松地融入各种角色，但同时你又无法真正地**给他定型**（pigeon hole: 指将某人或某事归类到狭窄的类别中）。所以，这是他从职业生涯一开始就一直在非常模糊地谈论的一种**巧妙策略**（crafty thing）。它也让观众在某种程度上能够在他身上看到自己的影子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean yeah across the franchise we learn he's somewhat Italian he has Cuban he has family in Cuba um he's a great Spanish language speaker by the seventh film he's fluent Um and yeah, so but it very much reflects Diesel's own um very carefully crafted persona. He's always been ethnically ambiguous in that he it's able for him to flit into one role or the other, but at the same time you can't really pigeon hole him. Um so it's a very kind of crafty thing that he's been talking about again in very vague terms since the very beginning of his career. And it also allows the audience to see themselves in him in some ways.</p>
</details>

主持人：没错。所以你可以是这个族裔或那个族裔，你都能找到与银幕上这些角色产生共鸣的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Exactly. So you can be one ethnicity or the other and you can find that, you know, way into relating to those characters on screen.</p>
</details>

### 复杂的时间线与“复活”角色

主持人：这些电影的**时间顺序**（chronology）真的很有趣，对吧？你提到了角色从一个时间线来到另一个时间线。你能否解释一下这些电影的时间顺序？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The chronology of these films is really interesting, right? And you mentioned characters coming from one timeline to another. How can you just explain or walk us through just the chronology of these films? Yeah, I think.</p>
</details>

Barry：好的，我想我可能需要再核对一下，但它们正确的**时间顺序**（chronological order）是第一部、第二部、第四部、第五部、第六部、第三部、第七部、第八部、第九部、第十部。所以，第三部和第四部之间发生了一个非常有趣的**追溯性连续性**（retroactive continuity: 简称**retcon**，指在系列作品中，通过后续作品修改或补充先前作品中已确立的设定或事件，以适应新的故事发展），就像我们这些**极客**（nerds）常说的**“吃书”**（retcon）。这基本上是导演林诣彬（Justin Lin）的结果，他执导的《速度与激情》电影比任何人都多，我想可以说他已经成为这个系列的创意总监。他希望让一个在第三部结尾被杀死的角色和演员活下来，他们非常喜欢这个角色，也就是姜成（Sung Kang）饰演的韩（Han），他是林诣彬的好朋友。观众也非常喜欢他，当他死的时候特别沮丧。所以林诣彬和姜成基本上就是**集思广益**（put their heads together），想：“嗯，他真的必须死吗？”林诣彬是看着很多漫画书、很多电视剧，比如《星际迷航》长大的，在那些作品中，**连续性**（continuity）可以被扭曲和改变，人们不一定非要因为死了就真的死了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, I I might have to double check myself as I run this through, but the correct chronological order of them is part one, part two, part four, part five, part six, part three, part seven, part eight, part nine, part [laughter] 10. So, there was a very fun kind of retroactive continuity thing, a retcon as, uh, nerds like me say, um, that happened with part three and part four, which was basically the result of director Justin Lynn, who has directed more fast films than anybody and I would say is probably has become the creative architect of that series. Um, it was his desire to keep one character and one actor specifically alive that had been killed off at the end of part three and they loved this character so much. Uh, Han played by Sun Kang, good friend of Justin Lynn. And the audiences loved him so much and they were particularly bummed when he died. And so Justin and S basically, you know, put their heads together. It's like, well, does he have to be dead? And Justin grew up with a lot of comic books, a lot of television, Star Trek where, you know, continuity could be twisted and torqued and people did not have to die just because they died.</p>
</details>

主持人：所以时间线就被调整了，第三部结尾之前的一切本质上都成了**闪回**（flashback）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So then the timeline was kind of shifted around so that everything pre the end of three was essentially a flashback.</p>
</details>

Barry：有很多角色死去又复活的情节。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's a lot of like dying and then coming back. There's a lot of dying and coming back.</p>
</details>

Barry：而且随着系列的演变，他们在这方面**变本加厉**（doubled and tripled down on it），也许效果越来越差。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and it they've they've kind of doubled and tripled down on it as the series has evolved perhaps to diminishing returns.</p>
</details>

### 《速度与激情》的粉丝文化与争议

主持人：是的。嗯，你在书中提到，这些电影大多没有像《星球大战》或DC等其他电影系列那样的**毒性**（toxicity）。你这是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Um well, I think you've said in said in the book that the films have mostly stayed clean of some of the toxicity that other movie franchises like Star Wars or DC seem to have. What did you mean by that?</p>
</details>

Barry：嗯，我觉得过去五六年左右，特别是当你有像《星球大战》这样备受喜爱的作品，它能激发出如此**狂热的激情**（rabid passion），当你稍微改变一些东西，让它更**多元化**（diverse）、更**现代**（contemporary）、更**进步**（progressive）时，你就会在某些**社群**（community）中激发出大量的**负面情绪**（toxicity），这些社群可能对作品过于**依恋**（attached）。所以，当《星球大战》中出现女性绝地武士蕾伊（Rey）时，这显然是你能做的最糟糕的事情。但《速度与激情》的粉丝，因为它的多元化社群是**根深蒂固**（baked in）的，只要你会开车，每个人都可以加入，所以这从来都不是一个问题。他们只是希望看到这个系列成长和扩张，希望这个“家庭”——“家庭”再次是这些电影的关键元素，包括血缘家庭和**选择的家庭**（found family）——欢迎所有人。这是一个盛大的、开放的家庭派对，如果你会开车，你就可以加入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, I feel like the online fandoms, particularly over the past five, six years or so, when you have like a beloved property like Star Wars that engenders such rabid passion, um, when you switch things up a little bit to maybe be a little more diverse, a little bit more contemporary, a little bit more progressive, um, you engender you you really engender a lot of, uh, toxicity among a certain, uh community that can feel so attached too attached to a property. So when you know the Star Wars stuff did uh Ry as a as a female Jedi that was apparently the worst thing in the world you could possibly do. Um but the fast fans because it's kind of baked in with like that more diverse community. Everybody can join so long as you can drive that it was never really a problem necessarily. They just wanted to see the franchise grow and expand and for that family and again family is such a key element of these films in that both the organic family and the found family um that everybody was welcome. It was a big kind of open family party and if you could drive you can come along.</p>
</details>

主持人：你认为“家庭”这个概念是电影成功的关键吗？我一直在想，为什么它们会如此受欢迎。你提到它是第八大**票房最高**（highest grossing）的电影系列，比《蝙蝠侠》、《侏罗纪公园》、《变形金刚》等系列还要高，票房达到了73亿美元。这是不是因为“家庭”这个概念让这些电影如此成功？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you think that's the key to the movie success is this notion of family? Like I I keep wondering like why they're so as as popular as ours. I think you mentioned it's like the eighth highest grossing uh film series and it's like more than like Batman, Jurassic Park, Transformers, like 7.3 billion at the box office. Is that kind of why like these movies are as successful as this notion of family?</p>
</details>

Barry：我认为这只是部分原因。而且直到第四部电影，他们才开始真正大力拥抱这个概念。如果你重看第一部电影，会觉得很有趣。我相信里面唯一一个说“家庭”这个词的角色是由特德·拉文（Ted Levine）饰演的警察，他之后再也没有出现在任何一部电影中。范·迪塞尔非常**精明地**（canily）意识到，人们正在形成情感上的依恋，并在自己的家庭生活中看到这种反映。我们应该尝试去**映射**（mirror）这一点，因为想想看，当涉及到汽车时，家庭中会发生什么？汽车代代相传。父亲教儿子，母亲教女儿开车。这非常像一种**血脉相承**（bloodline）的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's partially why. And it's something they didn't really start to really heavily embrace in pro until probably the fourth film, I would say. Um, it's kind of funny if you rewatch the first film. I believe the only character who says the word family in there is this cop played by Ted Lavine who never appears in any of the films ever again. Vin Diesel very canily realized that, okay, people are forming these attachments, emotional and otherwise, and they're seeing it reflected in their own home lives. Let's try to mirror that because think about it like what happens in a family when it comes to automobiles. are passed down from generation to generation. Fathers teaching sons, mothers teaching daughters how to drive. Um it is very much uh a bloodline kind of thing.</p>
</details>

Barry：所以，如果你能在电影中强调这一点，你就会对这些角色形成更深的依恋，你就会接受，好吧，他们正在做这些荒谬的事情。他们从摩天大楼上跳下来，他们从飞机和汽车上跳下来。我想我接受了，因为我想知道这些人会发生什么。我真的关心多米尼克·托雷托（Dominic Toretto）是生是死。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so if you could kind of emphasize that on film, then you would form these deeper attachments to these characters and you would buy almost, okay, they're doing these ridiculous scenarios. They're jumping out of skyscrapers. They're leaping from planes and cars. I guess I buy it because I want to see what happens to these people. I actually care whether Dominic Terretto lives or dies.</p>
</details>

主持人：但与其他电影系列，比如《指环王》或《哈利·波特》不同，它没有**背景故事**（lore），对吧？这些电影没有可以真正借鉴的**神话体系**（mythology）。所以我一直在想，他们是如何不断想出新故事的？我的意思是，如果他们只是街头赛车和劫案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But unlike other film series like The Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, there's not like a lore, right? Like there's no mythology for these movies to really draw from. So I've always wondered like how do they keep coming up with stories? I mean, if they're just basically street racing and and heists.</p>
</details>

Barry：我的意思是，那正是它的伟大之处。它们不受任何神话或背景故事的束缚。没有像《星球大战》宇宙那样必须遵守的时间线。比如，雅文战役（Battle of Yavin）在那里，所以他们不能在那个时候做这件事。真的没有。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I mean, that's the that's the great thing, though. They're not beholden to any kind of mythology or lore. There's there's not like this Star Wars universe you have to abide by in terms of timelines. It's like the battle of Yavin is there, so they can't be doing that at that time. Um, there's really</p>

主持人：你只想看这些人开车，完成这些疯狂的特技。

<details>

<p class="english-text">all you want to do is see these guys drive and pull off these crazy stunts.</p>
</details>

Barry：所以，很多电影实际上是先构建这些大型**场景**（set pieces: 指电影中精心设计和制作的动作或视觉奇观场面），然后**倒推**（reverse engineer）故事。对于第五部电影，这个系列真正**升级**（leveled up）的地方，他们意识到，好吧，前四部有很多街头赛车。让一个人比另一个人更快地从A点开到B点，能做的事情是有限的。所以，让我们**提高赌注**（up the ante: 指增加风险或挑战），把它变成一部**劫案电影**（heist film: 以抢劫为核心情节的电影）。让这些人真正有一个任务，一个可以说是不可能的任务，就像伊森·亨特（Ethan Hunt）那样。那正是他们开始升级的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, a lot of the films really are they construct these big set pieces first and then they kind of reverse engineer the story around it. And for the fifth film, which is where the franchise really kind of leveled up, um, they recognized that, okay, the first four, a lot of street racing in there. There's only so much we can do from having a guy drive from point A to point B faster than the other. So, let's up the ante. Let's turn it into a heist film. Let's make these guys actually have a mission, an impossible mission, one might say, in the Ethan Hunt. And that's really where they kind of started leveling up.</p>
</details>

主持人：从一个场景开始，这也不是《速度与激情》系列独有的，对吧？这现在是不是一种标准，我不知道，但我觉得《碟中谍》（Mission Impossible）系列也差不多是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's that starting with a setpiece that's not unique to the fast movies either, right? Like, isn't that kind of now I don't know if it's the standard, but I think Mission Impossible does pretty much the same thing.</p>
</details>

Barry：《碟中谍》系列完全是这样。很多漫威电影，就动作而言，很多那些**序列**（sequences）都是首先被构建和开发的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mission Impossible totally does the same thing. A lot of the Marvel films certainly in the, you know, in terms of action are rec a lot of those sequences are the first thing that gets constructed and developed.</p>
</details>

Barry：所以，这并非独有，但《速度与激情》系列是率先这样做的。你尤其可以在《碟中谍》系列电影中看到这一点，直到《幽灵协议》（Ghost Protocol）之前，它们都是**独立的**（standalone affairs: 指彼此之间没有太多连续性或关联性的故事）。你知道，汤姆·克鲁斯（Tom Cruise）每次都有不同的团队成员，除了文·瑞姆斯（Ving Rhames）之外，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and so it's not unique, but Fast was kind of the ones doing it first. And you see it especially in the Mission Impossible films, which up to I think uh Ghost Protocol, um, they were all standalone kind of affairs. you know, Tom Cruz had different team members each time with the exception of like Ving Reigns, right?</p>
</details>

主持人：然后你在《幽灵协议》中看到，它在第五部之后不久上映，哦，他试图把所有这些人带回来并团结起来，突然间西蒙·佩吉（Simon Pegg）等等，所有这些人都回到了团队中。所以这非常**刻意地呼应**（deliberately echoing）了《速度与激情》系列的成功。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then you see with the Ghost Protocol, which came out just a little bit after five, is that oh, he's trying to he's trying to bring all these people back and unite them and suddenly Simon Pegs and everything and we're having all these people come back into the fold. So, this is very deliberately echoing the success of what FastT was doing.</p>
</details>

### 女性角色与范·迪塞尔的选角

主持人：我想问你关于这些电影中的女性角色。值得注意的是，米歇尔·罗德里格兹（Michelle Rodriguez）和乔丹娜·布鲁斯特（Jordana Brewster）从一开始就在。后来你看到了查理兹·塞隆（Charlize Theron）和我最喜欢的海伦·米伦（Helen Mirren）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, I want to ask you about women in these movies. Uh, notably Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster have been from the very beginning. Later you get Chariss Therone and my favorite Helen Mirren.</p>
</details>

Barry：哦，当然。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, of course. Yes.</p>
</details>

主持人：但是她们不一定像男性角色那样处于电影的中心位置。我只是想知道你是否认为《速度与激情》系列**怠慢了**（done a disservice to: 指未能给予应有的尊重或关注，从而造成损害）其女性角色，并因此怠慢了她们的粉丝。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, but they're not necessarily at the center at the of these films the way that the the men have. And I'm just wondering if you think the Fast and Furious movies has has done a disservice to its female characters and by extension their fans.</p>
</details>

Barry：我的意思是，百分之百是这样。我认为米歇尔·罗德里格兹，她在媒体上对任何事情都非常**直言不讳**（vocal），她曾公开批评这个系列。在某个时候，我相信是在第七部和第八部电影之间，她站出来说：“听着，如果你不开始给我们更多的事情做，不增加更多不是**浪漫对象**（romantic objects: 指仅作为男性角色爱情或欲望的客体存在的女性角色）的女性角色，我就不干了。”值得称赞的是，他们确实开始在这方面做了一些工作，特别是给乔丹娜和米歇尔饰演的角色增加了更多彼此之间的对话和互动，而不仅仅是谈论她们生活中的男人。但这是一个大问题，从一开始就是。但如果米歇尔在第一部电影制作期间没有发声，说：“嗯，我在这里真的只是被塑造成一个**性感对象**（sex object）。”情况会更糟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, 100% certainly. And I think this was something that Michelle Rodriguez, who is very vocal about anything and everything in the press, um has publicly taken the franchise to task over. And there was at one point, um I believe it was between film seven and eight where she went out there and said like, "Listen, if you're not going to start giving us more to do and adding more women to the picture who are not just, you know, romantic objects, um I'm out." Um, and to their credit, they did start to work in a little bit more and give uh, especially the characters played by Jordana and Michelle, a little bit more dialogue between them and interactions that didn't just involve talking about the men in their lives. Um, but it is a it is a big problem. It has been since the beginning. But it was going to be even worse if Michelle hadn't spoken up during the production of the first film and said like, "Well, I'm really just being characterized here as this sex object.</p>
</details>

Barry：给我一些能让我投入的角色。尽管在最终的电影中，她的角色可能比较轻描淡写，但本来可能会更糟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Give me something to sink my teeth into a little bit." And as light as it was in the final film, it could have been much worse.</p>
</details>

主持人：我们来谈谈更多关于明星的事情，因为显然这些电影的成功很大程度上取决于范·迪塞尔。他是如何被选中的？这是一个有趣的故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, let's talk about more about the stars because obviously these movies kind of rest on the shoulders of Vin Diesel. How did he come to be cast? It's kind of an interesting story.</p>
</details>

Barry：最初，环球影业看中了蒂莫西·奥利芬特（Timothy Olyphant），他们当时非常看好他，他刚拍完道格·里曼（Doug Liman）的《Go》。他还主演了主题非常相似的《极速60秒》（Gone in 60 Seconds），这部电影稍后上映。可以说是一个有趣的选择。我也是蒂莫西·奥利芬特的忠实粉丝。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Originally, the studio Universal had their eyes on Timothy Olafant, who they were very hot on at the time, coming off of Doug Lyman's Go. Uh, he also had of the very similarly themed Gone in 60 Seconds coming out a little bit later. Kind of a interesting choice, let's say. And I'm a big Timothy Olafan fan. Me too.</p>
</details>

Barry：但他们需要一个更神秘、更有**吸引力**（lure）的人。这时范·迪塞尔出现了。但他当时在电影行业也有些**负面名声**（problematic reputation: 指在行业内因行为或态度问题而产生的不好评价）。他与导演**意见不合**（but heads with directors），有点**自我膨胀**（ego problem）。我的意思是，我们谈论的是一个从未主演过电影的人。他最多只是配角。他在《拯救大兵瑞恩》（Saving Private Ryan）中获得了重大突破。他刚拍完《星际传奇》（Pitch Black），那可以算是他的第一个**主角**（lead role），但那是一部相对较小的电影。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, but they needed somebody who was a little bit more mysterious, had a little bit more lure to him. and along comes Vin Diesel. Um, but he also had something of a problematic reputation around the industry at the time of the first film. Uh, but heads with directors. Um, had a little bit of an ego problem. And I mean, we're talking about a guy who had not led a film. Like, he was supporting roles at best. Like, he got a big break with Saving Private Ryan. He was just had finished Pitch Black, which was I guess you could call it his first lead role, but a relatively small movie.</p>
</details>

Barry：然而，他身上有一种**魅力**（magnetism），尤其是他与保罗·沃克（Paul Walker）的活力产生了火花，保罗·沃克是第一个被选中的，这部电影最初是围绕他这个**核心人物**（vehicle: 指故事或项目的核心驱动力）构建的。它从来都不是一个以范·迪塞尔为中心的**明星项目**（star project）。保罗从第一天起就在那里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and yet there was something about him, a magnetism, and especially one that bounced off the energy of Paul Walker, who was cast first and who this was really the person whose the vehicle was built around. It was never intended as a Vin Diesel star project. Paul was there from day one.</p>
</details>

### 范·迪塞尔的崛起与片场挑战

主持人：那么范·迪塞尔是如何成为主角的呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So then how does a Vin become the the lead, I guess?</p>
</details>

Barry：所以，一旦第一部电影在**票房上大获成功**（pops and explodes at the box office），他理所当然地被认为是业内顶尖人物之一，并为续集要求了**天价片酬**（astronomical amount of money）。但他们拒绝了。然而，保罗在合同上被**绑定**（contractually locked into: 指受合同约束，无法退出）了。所以他还在。于是他们说：“好吧，我们没有你也会拍续集。再见。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So once the first film really pops and explodes at the box office, he is, you know, rightly considered one of the top names in town, demands an astronomical amount of money for the sequel. Um, and they say no. Paul was however contractually locked into it. Um, and he was there. So they're like, "Okay, we'll make the sequel without you. Goodbye."</p>
</details>

Barry：他接着和执导第一部《速度与激情》的罗伯·科恩一起拍了《极限特工》（Triple X）。这部电影表现不错，但可能不算惊艳。他还尝试了其他一些事情，包括试图启动他的《星际传奇》续集。到第三部《速度与激情》电影上映时，他最初没有参与其中，但他们意识到在电影结尾需要某种**推动力**（kick），某种提醒观众这是一部《速度与激情》电影的元素。于是他们联系了范·迪塞尔，说：“你能在结尾客串一下吗？我们不仅会付你非常高的报酬，还会让你成为未来所有电影的**制片人**（producer）。”从那时起，整个系列就有了范·迪塞尔的**影响力**（Vin umbrella of it all）。所以，从第四部开始，他真正参与到电影的各个方面，作为主演、制片人，并获得了非常丰厚的报酬。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh he goes on to make Triple X with Rob Cohen who directed the first Fast film. Does pretty well but maybe not amazing. Tries a couple other things including trying to get his Riddic sequel off the ground. And by the time the third Fast film comes around in which he's not involved in it at the start, they realize they need some kind of kick toward the end, some kind of reminder that this is a Fast and Furious film. and they reach out to Vin and they say, "Can you do this little cameo at the end and not only will we pay you a very high amount of money, but we'll make you a producer on all films going forward and that is where it starts to have the VIN umbrella of it all." So, starting on the fourth, he is really there in every aspect you could be, star, producer, and getting paid very handsomely.</p>
</details>

主持人：他好像也不太准时到片场，是吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He also doesn't really show up to set on time, does he?</p>
</details>

Barry：他有非常**糟糕的准时到片场的名声**（poor reputation of showing up to set on time）。我为这本书采访的许多消息来源都指出，他基本上会在他的**拖车**（trailer: 指电影拍摄现场供演员休息和化妆的移动房屋）里待上**难以置信的长时间**（ungodly amounts of time），**拖延拍摄进程**（holding processes up），对剧本的某些部分、动作的某些部分非常**挑剔**（particular），很多天都浪费在等待范·迪塞尔上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He has a a very poor reputation of showing up to set on time. Uh many sources I spoke with uh for the research of this book point to him basically staying inside his trailer for ungodly amounts of time. uh holding processes up, being very particular about certain points of the script, certain points of action, and a lot of days were wasted waiting for Vin.</p>
</details>

### 保罗·沃克的意外离世与数字复活

主持人：你提到了保罗·沃克，这个系列的悲剧之一是他在制作《速度与激情7》（Furious 7）期间去世了。他们是如何在没有他的情况下完成电影的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mentioned Paul Walker and um one of the tragedies of this series is that he passed uh in the middle of making Furious 7. How did they finish the movie without him?</p>
</details>

Barry：我的意思是，这对整个行业来说，是一个可怕且**前所未有的局面**（unprecedented situation）。不仅是失去他这么年轻的悲剧，更具**可怕讽刺意味**（horrible irony）的是，这发生在一场关于车祸的电影中，而他本人也死于车祸。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, that was kind of a horrible and unprecedented situation for the industry at large. Um, not only was there just the tragedy of losing him so young, there was the horrible irony of it happening in a car crash in a movie about car crashes,</p>
</details>

主持人：对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right?</p>
</details>

Barry：所以，当这件事发生在感恩节假期前后时，他们已经完成了《速度与激情7》大约一半的拍摄，但还有很多场景需要他来拍。所以他们必须做出决定：我们要**放弃这部电影**（scrap the movie）吗？我们要尝试**重拍**（recreate it）吗？或者我们该怎么做？于是，很多非常聪明的人聚集在一起，想出了一个办法，他们可以结合**实际特效**（practical effects: 指通过物理手段在拍摄现场制作的特效，而非后期电脑生成）和**视觉特效**（visual effects: 指通过电脑软件在后期制作中添加的特效）来完成。他们找来了他的两个弟弟，迦勒（Caleb）和科迪（Cody）。一个的脸型与他很匹配，另一个的身体更匹配。他们把他们**结合起来**（smoosh them together）。我们还会找另一位演员，他也与保罗很像，帮助他们适应表演风格。我们将提取保罗·沃克所有被拍摄下来的档案资料，我们将提取所有这些镜头并进行**数字处理**（digitally manipulate）。他们就是这样做的。他们用一种**“僵尸化”**（zombified: 指通过数字技术使已故演员在电影中“复活”出现）的方式，完成了这部电影。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, when that happened and it was around Thanksgiving break, um, they were about halfway through finishing Furious 7 and there was still a lot of scenes that he needed to shoot. Um, so they had to make a decision. Are we gonna scrap the movie? are we going to try to recreate it or how are we going to do this? So, a lot of very smart people came together, figured out they could do it with a mix of practical um and visual effects. Well, get his two younger brothers onto the set, Caleb and Cody. One was a good match for his face, one's a better match for his body. Kind of smoosh them together. We'll have another actor who was also kind of a good fit for Paul kind of help them adjust to the acting styles. We're gonna take every single archival minute or second of Paul Walker that's ever been captured on film. We're going to take that and we're going to ex extract all that footage and digitally manipulate it. And that's kind of what they did. They kind of, for lack of a better term, zombified Paul Walker as a being cinematically and finished the film.</p>
</details>

主持人：这种做法是否在某种程度上让好莱坞走上了**数字复活演员**（digitally resurrecting actors）的道路？因为我的意思是，我们在《星球大战》电影中看到了这种情况。凯丽·费雪（Carrie Fisher）显然在《星球大战：天行者崛起》（Rise of Skywalker）上映前去世了。伊恩·霍姆（Ian Holm）在《异形：罗慕路斯》（Alien Romulus）中被复活了。那么《速度与激情》系列是否也应该因此获得开创好莱坞这条道路的功劳呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Did this sort of set Hollywood on a path of digitally resurrecting actors in in some way? Because I mean, we've seen this with with the Star Wars movies. Carrie Fischer obviously died before uh Rise of Skywalker came out. Ian Holm was resurrected for Alien Romulus. Is is fast? Could they be given credit for also starting Hollywood on this path too?</p>
</details>

Barry：我的意思是，就他们所做的程度而言，是的。以前也曾以非常有限的方式做过。但他们当时确实是在**即兴发明**（inventing on the fly）技术和实践。你知道，我为这本书采访的一个非常深入参与视觉特效的人，当然不认为他们是**人工智能深度伪造**（AI deep fake: 指利用人工智能技术生成虚假图像、音频或视频）潮流的先驱，但他们确实是。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean in to the degree that they were doing it, yes it had been done before in very limited fashion. Um but they were really inventing technology and practices on the fly as they were doing this. And you know, one of the people I spoke to for the book who's very heavily involved in the visual effects there, um, you know, of course, didn't think that they were, you know, at the forefront of this AI deep fake train, but they were.</p>
</details>

Barry：这就是我们今天所处的境地。这也是为什么当范·迪塞尔在人群中说“下一部我们要带回布莱恩·奥康纳（Brian O'Conor），我们要带回保罗·沃克的角色”时，粉丝社区会产生一些**令人不安的情绪**（troubling emotions）。好吧，你要怎么做？很可能以一种让很多人感到不安的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's where we are today. And that's why you have some troubling um you know emotions in the fan community when someone like Vin Diesel goes out to a crowd and says for the next one I'm we're bringing back Brian Oconor. We're bringing back Paul Walker's character. Okay. How are you doing that? Probably in a way that is going to be disturbing to a lot of people.</p>
</details>

### 巨石强森的加入与系列的新高度

主持人：道恩·强森（Dwayne Johnson），巨石强森，他在《速度与激情5》（Fast Five）中加入。他加入后，这个系列真的**一飞冲天**（take off）了吗？他是否应该被认为是真正将这些电影推向**新高度**（new stratosphere）的人？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dwayne Johnson, The Rock, he joins in Fast Five. Do these series really take off when he joins? Like is he is he could he be credited with really launching these into a new stratosphere?</p>
</details>

Barry：绝对是。我觉得如果你去问任何一个《速度与激情》的粉丝，问他们最喜欢哪一部，95%的人会说是第五部，因为那是道恩·强森加入的时候，他真正**激发了**（adrenalizes: 指注入活力，使其兴奋或加速）这个系列，并将其送入了**平流层**（stratosphere: 比喻达到非常高的水平）。所有参与其中的人都知道，从他开始拍摄的那一刻起。他带来了巨大、丰富、迷人、**自负**（cocky）的能量，这让一切都**升级**（ramps up）了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh absolutely. I feel if you canvas any fast fan and ask them which their which entry is their all-time favorite, five will come up 95% of the time because that is when Dwayne Johnson arrives and just adrenalizes the franchise um and sends it into the stratosphere and everybody involved in that knew it the second that he started shooting. Um, he just brings this huge, bountiful, charming, cocky energy to it. Um, that just ramps up everything.</p>
</details>

主持人：他和范·迪塞尔的关系不是最好的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And not the best relationship with Vin Diesel.</p>
</details>

Barry：嗯，是的，和范·迪塞尔的关系不是最好的。你有两个**强势人物**（alpha guys: 指在群体中具有领导力、自信和支配欲的男性），对吧，他们聚在一起扮演**主角**（protagonist）和**反派**（antagonist），你让他们**冲突**（colliding）。在范·迪塞尔的故事中，你会听到他说他利用这种**紧张关系**（tension）来**推动银幕上的动作**（fuel the on-screen action）。但如果你和道恩·强森以及他的人谈，他们会说，范·迪塞尔只是为了**找茬**（being a jerk）而找茬。这就是紧张关系所在。这种紧张关系一直处于**稳定酝酿**（steady simmer）状态，但在第八部电影制作期间真正**爆发**（exploded）了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, no, not the best relationship with [laughter] Vin Diesel. You have two alpha guys, right, coming together to play protagonist and antagonist, and you're colliding them. And in Vin Diesel's tension, you would kind of in Vin Diesel's story rather, you would hear him say like he was using that tension to fuel the on-screen action. And if you were to talk maybe to Dwayne Johnson and his people, it was like, well, Vin was kind of just being a jerk for the sake of being a jerk. And that's where the tension kind of lied. And it was always at like a steady kind of simmer, but really exploded during the production of the eighth film.</p>
</details>

主持人：是的。他们甚至没有真正地**同框**（sharing scenes）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. They're not even sharing scenes really.</p>
</details>

Barry：我的意思是，他们没有同框。巨石强森在Instagram上**猛烈抨击**（lay out this tirade against）了一位未具名的男**联合主演**（co-star）。没有人需要名字就知道他在说谁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, they're not sharing scenes. The Rock went on Instagram to, you know, lay out this tirade against an unnamed male co-star. Nobody needed a name to know who he was talking about.</p>
</details>

Barry：从那时起他们就**一直不和**（at loggerheads），尽管显然他们已经决定**和解**（embrace and make up）。巨石强森在第十部电影的结尾**客串**（cameo）了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And they've since been at loggerheads, although um apparently they have decided to embrace and and make up. And The Rock made that uh cameo at the end of the 10th film.</p>

主持人：预示着未来会有更多的冒险。所以，你知道，归根结底**金钱至上**（money talks）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Promising more adventures to come. So, you know, money talks at the end of the day.</p>

主持人：在第五部电影中，当他们打架时，他们谁都不想被看作是输家。所以他们必须计算每个人挨了多少拳。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the fifth movie, when they're fighting, they neither of them wants to be seen as losing. So, they have to count how many punches each one gets.</p>
</details>

Barry：是的。所以这是**打斗数学**（fight math）。基本上，当你有这些**重量级**（caliber: 指人物或事物的能力、重要性或影响力）的明星时，没有人愿意被看作是比对方挨揍更多。所以，每一次**刺拳**（jab）、每一次**重击**（blow）、每一次**出拳**（punch），都是经过**计算**（calculated）的，这样每个人都能**打成平手**（comes out equal）。我为这本书采访的一个人说：“基本上，《速度与激情》的打斗中从来没有赢家。是平局。永远是平局。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, it's fight math. Um, basically, so when you have these stars of these caliber, nobody wants to be seen as getting their butt kicked more than the other. [groaning and screaming] So, every jab, every blow, every punch, it's all calculated so that everybody comes out equal. One person I spoke to for the book said, "Basically, there's never a winner in a Fast and Furious fight. It's a tie. It's always a tie."</p>

### 《速度与激情》的未来与创意挑战

主持人：自2023年的《速度与激情10》以来，我们还没有看到新的《速度与激情》电影。这个系列的**现状**（status）如何？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, we haven't seen a Fast movie since 2023's Fast X. What's the status of the series?</p>
</details>

Barry：不太好。尤其是因为《速度与激情10》以两个巨大的**悬念**（cliffhangers: 指故事在关键时刻中断，留下未解决的冲突或疑问）结束。基本上，每个角色的生命都悬而未决。一架载着他们其中一些人的飞机坠毁在山上。我们不知道那发生了什么。然后范·迪塞尔的角色和他的儿子正面临着**岩石、碎片和火焰的雪崩**（avalanche of rock and debris and fire），我们就是不知道会发生什么。部分原因是它一直处于一种**深度冻结**（deep freeze: 比喻停滞不前或被搁置）状态，因为他们一直在努力解决**经济问题**（economics）。这些电影的制作成本变得如此之高，因为演员们此时要求如此多的报酬。他们在世界各地几十个地方拍摄。**特技工作**（stunt work）、**特效工作**（effects work），所有这些都加起来了。这甚至还没有算上**营销成本**（marketing costs），而且**账算不清楚**（the math isn't mathing: 流行语，指逻辑或计算不合理）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's not great. Um, especially because Fast X ended with two giant cliffhers. Basically, every character's lives were in question. There's a jet carrying a bunch of them, then crash into a mountain. We didn't see what happened to that. And then Vin Diesel's character and his son are staring down like this avalanche of of rock and debris and fire and we just don't know what happens. Um, partially it's been in a kind of deep freeze because they've been trying to figure out the economics of it. Like these movies have become so expensive to make because the cast demands so much money by this point. They shoot it in dozens of locations around the world. The stunt work, the effects work, it all adds up. And that's before you even get to marketing costs and the math just isn't mathing as the kids like to say.</p>
</details>

Barry：所以，在此之前它一直处于某种**停滞状态**（freeze）。另外，范·迪塞尔正面临一起**民事诉讼**（civil lawsuit），涉及**性侵犯**（sexual assault），这方面报道一直**不足**（underreported）。他**否认了所有指控**（contested all those allegations）。这还没有在法庭上**审理**（tested in court）。我估计它将在2026年2月开庭审理。我采访过的人都说，一旦这件事以某种方式**解决**（resolved one way or the other），我们就会对《速度与激情》系列的未来有更好的了解。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it's been on a little bit of a freeze before that. And also because um Vin Diesel is facing a civil lawsuit um for sexual uh assault which has been kind of under reportported. Um it was you know he has contested all those allegations. It has not been tested in court. It will go to courts in February of 2026. I imagine and the people that I have talked with uh have have said this that once that is resolved one way or the other, we will have a better idea of what the future of the Fast and the Furious is.</p>

主持人：没有他很难看到一部电影。

<p class="english-text">Be hard to see a movie without him.</p>
</details>

Barry：确实如此。我的意思是，这是一种罕见的**大型商业电影**（big blockbuster film），你不能简单地**重选主角**（recast the hero）。你知道，我们有四任蝙蝠侠，我们有五任蜘蛛侠，但多米尼克·托雷托只有一个，那就是范·迪塞尔。

<details>

<p class="english-text">It would be. I mean, this is the rare big blockbuster film where you just cannot simply recast the hero. You know, we've had four Batman's, we've had, you know, five Spider-Mans, but there's only one Dominic Tretto, and it's Vin.</p>
</details>

主持人：不过，从创意角度来看，这个系列是不是**黔驴技穷**（run out of gas: 比喻创意枯竭，失去动力）了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Creatively, though, has the franchise run out of gas?</p>
</details>

Barry：我想你可能在每一部电影上映后都可以提出这个论点，比如：“好吧，我们已经**达到顶峰**（hit the peak）了。无路可走了。”然而，他们似乎总能找到一种方式来**让你惊喜**（surprise you）。所以，我认为未来的方向，以及环球影业内部的看法似乎也是如此，那就是我们真的不能再**做得更大**（go bigger）了。我们已经做到了极致。我们甚至去了外太空。我们不一定会引入像**时间旅行**（time travel）这样**奇幻的元素**（fantastical element）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think you could probably have used that argument after each one of the films has come out, like, okay, we've kind of hit the peak here. There's nowhere to go. And yet, they always kind of seem to find a way to surprise you. So, I think the way to go and the sentiment inside Universal seems to be this way as well is we can't really go bigger. We've gone as big as we possibly can. We've gone to outer space. Um, we're not going to necessarily introduce some fantastical element like time travel maybe. Um, [laughter]</p>
</details>

Barry：所以我们必须把它带回街头，多一些**艰苦奋斗**（hard scrabble），多一些**粗犷**（grit）。我并不认为它在创意上已经**江郎才尽**（creatively exhausted itself）。我认为，至少在目前，它总能找到让我们惊喜的方式。

<details>

<p class="english-text">so we got to take it back to the streets a little bit, do a little bit more hard scrabble, a little more grit. I do not think that uh creatively it it's exhausted itself. I I think it will always, at least for the time being, find ways to surprise us.</p>
</details>

主持人：我昨晚看了上一部电影，我觉得当杰森·莫玛（Jason Momoa）出现时，他带来了令人难以置信的**混乱能量**（chaotic energy）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I did find I watched the last movie last night and I thought when they had when Jason Mamoa I thought brought an incredible chaotic energy.</p>
</details>

Barry：哦，是的。我的意思是，他正在做这种奇怪的**性别酷儿**（gender queer）版的希斯·莱杰（Heath Ledger）小丑（Joker）式表演。他给那种能量带来了巨大的火花。所以你只需要一个**X因素**（X factor: 指难以预测但能产生巨大影响的因素），就像巨石强森之于第五部，就像杰森·莫玛之于第十部。是的，有很多杰森。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh yeah. I mean he's doing this weird gender queer Heath Ledger Joker kind of thing. And he just like brings a huge spark to that energy. So all you need is like that one kind of X factor in there like Dwayne Johnson was for five like Jason was uh for 10 like or Jason Mimoa. Yeah, there's a lot of Jason.</p>
</details>

Barry：所以当杰森·斯坦森（Jason Statham）加入，当杰森·莫玛加入时，你只需要加入那个**不确定因素**（wildcard element），你就能创造出伟大的东西。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Um so when Staithm came in, when Mimoa came in, you just have to add that um wildcard element and you can create great things.</p>

### 系列最佳影片：第五部《速度与激情》

主持人：最后一个问题。这个系列中你最喜欢哪部电影？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Last question. What's your favorite film in the series?</p>
</details>

Barry：我不得不随大流，说是第五部。第五部是所有元素真正**融合**（comes together）的地方。它不仅是林诣彬将前四部电影中**分散的元素**（disparate elements）结合起来，而且在动作方面真正**提升了赌注**（upping the ante）。我觉得那部电影至少有三四个动作**场景**（action set pieces）本身就是**经典**（all-timers）。你不仅有里约热内卢的**金库追逐战**（vault chase），还有开头的**火车劫案**（train heist）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm going to have to go with the consensus and say five. Um five is where it really all comes together. Uh, it's not only Justin Lynn kind of uniting the disparit elements of the first four films, but really upping the ante in terms of action. I feel that film has like easily like three or four action set pieces that are alltimers in their own right. You not only have that vault chase through uh Rio de Janeiro, but you have that train heist in the beginning.</p>
</details>

Barry：还有开头的**巴士翻车**（bus flip）。里面有一些很棒的**街头赛车**（street racing）。还有范·迪塞尔和巨石强森在**仓库**（warehouse）里那几场精彩的打斗，他们真的把那个地方和彼此都**拆得七零八落**（tearing that place and each other apart）。它很精彩，而且**演技也很棒**（acting is great）。一切都**融合在一起**（comes together）。绝对也是我最喜欢的电影之一。巴里，这次访谈太棒了。欢迎来到“家庭”，这是《速度与激情》系列电影背后的**爆炸性故事**（explosive story），这些**商业大片**（blockbusters）**点燃了世界**（supercharge the world）。非常感谢你今天加入我们。

<p class="english-text">Um, you have the bus flip at the very beginning. Um, you have, uh, this some great street racing in there. Um, you have some amazing fights that Vin Dwayne fight through the warehouse where they're just really like tearing that place and each other apart. Um, it's wonderful and uh, the acting is great. It just all comes together. Definitely one of my favorites, too. Listen, Barry, this has been amazing. Welcome to the family, the explosive story behind Fast and Furious, the blockbusters that supercharge the world. Thank you so much for joining us today.</p>
