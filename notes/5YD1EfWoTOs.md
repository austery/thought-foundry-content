### 詹姆斯·鲍德温：一位以爱为核心的作家与偶像

MJ Franklin: 欢迎收听《书评播客》。我是《纽约时报书评》的编辑MJ Franklin。本周的播客，我们邀请到尼古拉斯·博格斯来聊聊他的新书《鲍德温：一个爱情故事》。

<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to the Book Review Podcast. I'm MJ Franklin. I'm an editor here at the New York Times Book Review. And this week on the podcast, we're talking to Nicholas Bogs about his new book, Baldwin, a Love Story.</p>
</details>

这本书集多种特质于一身：它是一部关于鲍德温其人、其作家身份、其偶像地位的全面传记；它对鲍德温的作品进行了令人愉悦的深入挖掘，充满了对其书籍和散文的细致解读；而最重要的是，它提出了一种理解鲍德温的新批判框架，这个框架就是“爱”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This book is many things at once. It's a comprehensive biography of Baldwin, the person, the writer, the icon. It's a really enjoyable excavation of Baldwin's work filled with plenty of close reading of his books and pros. And most pressingly, it's an argument for a new critical framework to understand Baldwin. And that framework is love.</p>
</details>

这部传记围绕鲍德温与一系列男性的关系展开，正如博格斯所阐述的，这些关系塑造了鲍德温的生活和写作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The biography is structured around Baldwin's relationships with a series of men that, as Bogs outlines, shaped Bodwin's life and writing.</p>
</details>

就我个人而言，这本书完全吸引了我。我认为这部传记生动、富有启发性、有说服力且信息量大，是今年迄今为止我最喜欢的作品之一，这也是我今天很高兴能与尼古拉斯谈论它的原因。尼古拉斯，欢迎你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And just personally, it's a book that completely captured me. I thought this biography was lively, inspired, persuasive, informative. It's one of my favorites from the year so far, which is why I'm excited to talk with Nicholas about it today. Nicholas, welcome.</p>
</details>

Nicholas Boggs: 很高兴来到这里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So happy to be here.</p>
</details>

MJ Franklin: 感谢你的加入，我非常期待深入探讨这本书。但在那之前，我想先从一个宽泛而简单得令人尴尬的问题开始：詹姆斯·鲍德温是谁？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you for joining us. And I'm so excited to dive into this book. But before we do that, I want to start with a broad, embarrassingly simple question, which is who is James Baldwin?</p>
</details>

这可能听起来像一个愚蠢的起点，但我之所以想从这里开始，是因为我认为很多人对詹姆斯·鲍德温究竟是谁有不同的看法，原因有几点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that may seem like a silly starting point, but I wanted to start there because I think a lot of different people have a lot of different ideas about who James Baldwin even is for a few reasons.</p>
</details>

首先，作为一名艺术家，他才华横溢，涉猎多种创作模式，包括小说、非虚构作品、戏剧和电影。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First, just as an artist, he was so multiaceted. He worked in many different modes, fiction, non-fiction, theater, film.</p>
</details>

有些人认为他是一位写散文的小说家，另一些人则认为他是一位写小说的散文家和演说家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some people know him as a novelist who wrote essays. Other know him as an essayist and aertor who wrote novels.</p>
</details>

有些人把他看作一个政治人物。所以我想先奠定基础，用你的话来定义詹姆斯·鲍德温是谁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some people think of him as a political figure. So I wanted to set the table and define on your terms who is James Baldwin.</p>
</details>

Nicholas Boggs: 首先，他是一个人。我认为这一点有时会被遗忘，对吗？在他被神化或多年来被诋毁的过程中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First of all, he was a human being. And I think that's something that sometimes gets lost, right, in the lionization of him or the malignment of him over the years.</p>
</details>

他有一个重要的形象，那就是作为民权运动的偶像。我们可以在视频片段和网络迷因中看到这些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's this image of him, which is an important one as a kind of icon of the civil rights movement. And we see these in clips and memes and things like that.</p>
</details>

但我们经常忽略的是，这种声音从何而来？他是如何成为他自己的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But what we often lose is that where was this voice coming from? How did he become who he was?</p>
</details>

在这本书中，我想要探讨的是那些支持他、成就他、使他能够将自己的一切奉献给世界的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what I wanted to look at in this book was the people who sustained him, the people who enabled him, who made it possible for him to give all that he did to the world.</p>
</details>

### 鲍德温的时代意义与核心主题

MJ Franklin: 我们之前聊过一点，你对詹姆斯·鲍德温的伟大之处有非常强烈的看法。你曾说，我相信他是21世纪最伟大的作家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we were talking a little bit before, but you have very strong opinions about the greatness of James Baldwin. You said, I believe he's the greatest writer of the 21st century.</p>
</details>

Nicholas Boggs: 我认为他是20世纪最重要的作家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think he's the most important writer of the 20th century.</p>
</details>

MJ Franklin: 是的，我认为他是20世纪最重要的作家。我认为他所经历的生活，他所书写的问题，他亲身经历的民权运动、妇女权利运动、同性恋运动——即使他没有过多参与后者，他也目睹了所有这些运动，并将它们融入到他的写作中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think he's the most important writer of the 20th century. I think that the the life that he lived, the issues that he was writing about, living through the civil rights movement, living through the women's rights movement, living through the gay and lesbian movement, even if he wasn't involved so much in the latter, he witnessed all them and it infused his writing.</p>
</details>

因为我们现在看到，由于“黑人的命也是命”运动以及世界上发生的一切，他与我们同在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And because we see now he's so present with us because of Black Lives Matters, because of everything that's going on in the world.</p>
</details>

所以，在某种程度上，说他是最好的作家是非常主观的，但如果我们审视他所写内容的深远影响以及他如何做到这一点，我认为他是最重要的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think in a way it's very subjective to say the best writer, but if we look at the implications of what he was writing about and how he was able to do it, I think he is the most important.</p>
</details>

你能向我们介绍他的一些主题吗？不是逐一列举每本书，而是从广义上讲，他在小说和非虚构作品中探讨了哪些内容？他的作品在主题上处理了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And can you introduce us to some of his themes? If not a playbyplay, here's every single book, but broadly speaking, what did he tackle in his fiction and non-fiction? What did he tackle in his work thematically?</p>
</details>

Nicholas Boggs: 当然，他探讨了爱，但我们可以稍后再回到这个话题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, he tackled love, of course, but we can return to that.</p>
</details>

我认为他真正探讨的是美国人，尤其是白人美国人所执着的这种虚假的“**无辜**（Innocence: 指对历史和自身责任的逃避）”观念。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Really, I think what he was tackling was this false notion of innocence that Americans were invested in, white Americans in particular.</p>
</details>

这种观念认为历史不重要，认为那些可怕的事情从未发生过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This idea that the history didn't matter, that there hadn't been all this these terrible things that had happened.</p>
</details>

他在《村里的陌生人》（Stranger in the Village）中写道，这种无辜构成了罪行，只要白人美国人不能批判性地审视过去并正视它，他们就永远无法解决前进中的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There was this idea, he wrote about it in Stranger in the Village, that the innocence constitutes the crime, that as long as white Americans don't look at the past critically and sort of come to terms with it, that will never be able to solve their problems as they move forward.</p>
</details>

MJ Franklin: 你更多地把他看作一个政治人物还是一个文学人物？一个非虚构作家还是一个小说家？你是如何看待他的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And do you see him more as a political figure or a literary figure and a a non-fiction writer or a fiction writer? How do you see him?</p>
</details>

Nicholas Boggs: 我把他看作一个艺术家。我认为他可能是一个艺术家所能达到的最接近**行动主义者**（Activist: 致力于社会或政治变革的人）的程度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I see him as an artist. I see him as probably as close to an activist. I think Zadeie Smith talks about this in a recent essay. as close to an activist as an artist can be.</p>
</details>

但我觉得，从根本上说，他会认为自己是一名艺术家。他曾说他想成为一名小说家，并认为自己主要是一名小说家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I believe that at his core he would saw himself as an artist. That's what he said he wanted to and he saw himself as primarily as a novelist.</p>
</details>

MJ Franklin: 有两件事。第一，我们喜欢在这个播客上推荐好书。那篇Zadie Smith的散文标题是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Two things. One, we love a recommendation on this podcast. What was that Zadeie Smith essay title?</p>
</details>

Nicholas Boggs: 她的新书《死而复生》（Dead and Alive）已经出版了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So her new book is out, Dead and Alive.</p>
</details>

里面有一篇精彩的散文，叫做《技艺与良知》（Craft and Conscience）。我相信那是她作为纽约大学教授时做的最后一次演讲，关于鲍德温的论述非常出色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there is an incredible essay in it called Craft and Conscience. I believe it's her the last lecture she gave as an NYU professor and it's just brilliant on Baldwin.</p>
</details>

MJ Franklin: 所以除了这本书，大家也可以去看看那篇文章。另外，这就是鲍德温。我们已经宏观地介绍了鲍德温。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So go check that out in addition to this book. But then also that is Baldwin. We have introduced Baldwin big picture.</p>
</details>

我再次想先奠定基础，弄清楚我们谈论的不仅仅是一位标志性的小说家。我们谈论的是一个人，一位对20世纪及以后美国生活产生深远影响的艺术家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And again, I wanted to just set the table and figure out, we're not talking about just an iconic novelist. We're talking about a human. We're talking about an artist who had profound implications for American life in the 20th century and beyond.</p>
</details>

现在，我想转换话题，问问这本书《鲍德温：一个爱情故事》讲了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, I want to pivot and ask, what is this book Baldwin, a love story?</p>
</details>

Nicholas Boggs: 这本书是一部传记，因为它以时间顺序讲述了他700页的生平，但它是通过爱情故事来讲述的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, this book is a biography because it tells his life chronologically for 700 pages, but it does so through love stories.</p>
</details>

这就是它被称为《鲍德温：一个爱情故事》的原因。他生命中的四段伟大爱情，那些他献书、合作、真正支撑他艺术实践的男性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's why it's called Baldwin, a love story. The four great loves of his life, the men that he dedicated books to, that he collaborated with, that he that really sustained him in his artistic practice.</p>
</details>

这本书中也有女性，比如Toni Morrison、Lorraine Hansberry、Maya Angelou，但我专注于这些男性，因为我相信通过审视他们，我们能理解他创作实践和过程的核心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There are women throughout this book as well. Tony Morrison, Lorraine Hanssbury, Maya Angelou, but I focused on these men because I believe that by looking at them, we understood the core of his creative practice and process.</p>
</details>

### 爱：理解鲍德温创作的独特视角

MJ Franklin: 你能多谈谈这一点吗？如果我没理解错的话，这本书认为，理解鲍德温、欣赏他、他的作品和他的天赋，最好的方式之一，如果不是唯一最好的方式，就是通过“爱”的视角。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can you say more about that? Correct me if I'm wrong, but this book argues that one of the best ways, if not the very best way, to understand Baldwin and to appreciate him and his work and his genius is through the lens of love.</p>
</details>

Nicholas Boggs: 我并不是在提出一个论点。我希望，也认为我试图通过这些故事来展示情况确实如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, I don't make an argument. I hope I think I try to show through these stories how that's the case.</p>
</details>

故事始于他在格林威治村遇到Buford Delaney。Buford是一位黑人艺术家兼画家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it begins when he meets Buford Delaney in Greenwich Village and Buford is a black artist painter.</p>
</details>

鲍德温在哈莱姆贫民区长大，他是牧师的儿子，自己也是一名牧师。他当时不明白，有一个全新的世界向他敞开，一切皆有可能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Baldwin is growing up in Proverton Harlem. He's a preacher's son. He's a preacher himself. He doesn't understand that there's this whole world open to him that's possible.</p>
</details>

Buford为他画肖像，向他介绍了在他家中被禁止的蓝调和爵士乐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Buford paints portraits of him. He introduces him to blues and jazz which are outlawed in his house.</p>
</details>

他向鲍德温展示了一个黑人男性也可以成为艺术家。鲍德温还写道，所有艺术都源于爱。这是Buford教给他的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And he shows him that a black man, as Baldwin put it, could be an artist. He also wrote Baldwin says that all art is created out of love. This is something that Buford taught him.</p>
</details>

MJ Franklin: 我发现这种以爱为核心、以爱为论点（或者说展示和证明）的方式，非常安静而激进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I found this love anchor, this love thesis, this love not argument but showcase and demonstration to be very quietly radical.</p>
</details>

我认为这是因为从表面上看，有人可能会争辩说，爱和浪漫关系一直都在塑造着各种类型、各种媒介的艺术家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think that because on the surface, one could argue that love and romantic relationships shape artists all the time of all shapes and sizes and all different mediums.</p>
</details>

它塑造了从莎士比亚到弗吉尼亚·伍尔夫再到泰勒·斯威夫特的每一个人。但这个论点远不止于此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It shaped everyone from Shakespeare to Virginia Wolf to Taylor Swift. But this thesis is more than that.</p>
</details>

这里的论点，或者说展示，是爱不仅塑造了鲍德温，就像它塑造了我们所有人一样，而且对爱的追求激励了鲍德温去写作，并驱使他创作了特定的长篇小说、散文和项目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The argument or I guess the showcase here is that it was not only love that shaped Baldwin as it shaped all of us, but that the pursuit of love inspired Baldwin to write and drove him to particular novels and essays and projects.</p>
</details>

他与特定的人合作，是因为他对他们复杂且有时是单相思的爱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That he collaborated with particular people because of his complicated and/or sometimes unrequited love for them.</p>
</details>

他做出商业和艺术决策，部分是为了管理这些关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He made business and artistic decisions in part to manage those relationships.</p>
</details>

我认为最重要的是，你展示了爱创造了条件，使鲍德温在创作中取得了重大突破，并最终完成了我们今天所读的杰作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think most importantly, you show that love created the conditions under which Baldwin made significant breakthroughs in and ultimately finished the masterpieces that we read today.</p>
</details>

所以，这不仅仅是鲍德温被爱所激励，而是爱是他作品中处理的核心事物，也是他作为一个人被驱动的核心事物。我这样表述正确吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so it's more than that just Baldwin was animated by love, but love was a core thing that he tackled in his work. It was a core thing that drove him as a person. Am I framing that correctly?</p>
</details>

Nicholas Boggs: 绝对正确。他有一种爱的政治，这也很值得讨论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely. He had a politics of love which is also worth discussing.</p>
</details>

但在他的创作过程中，他直到搬到法国，并与年轻的瑞士人Lucian Hapersburgger相爱后，才得以完成他的第一部小说《去山上告诉它》（Go Tell It on the Mountain）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But in terms of his creative process he was not able to finish his first novel Go tell in the mountain until he moved to France and Lucian Hapersburgger this young Swiss guy took him to the Swiss Alps with this family chalet nursed him back to health and created this kind of idyllic situation where Baldwin could listen to Bessie Smith records and remember the voice of his childhood where he could feel loved and seen as he said by Lucenne and this allowed him to finish the novel.</p>
</details>

Lucian带他去了瑞士阿尔卑斯山，在一个家庭木屋里照顾他康复，创造了一种田园诗般的环境，让鲍德温可以听Bessie Smith的唱片，回忆童年的声音，在那里他可以感受到被Lucian爱和理解。这使他得以完成这部小说。他就在瑞士阿尔卑斯山完成了它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He finished right there up up in the Swiss Alps.</p>
</details>

MJ Franklin: 你指出，我非常喜欢传记中的这一点，即《去山上告诉它》这个标题具有双重含义。它既是黑人教会中常说的一句谚语：“去山上告诉它”，但对鲍德温来说，他也确实和这个他所爱的男人一起在山上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you point out, and I love this in the biography, that there is that double entandra of go tell it on the mountain as a title that it's this black saying frequently in the black church, go tell it on the mountain. But then for Baldwin too, he literally was on the mountain with this man that he loved.</p>
</details>

这个标题中有一种你可能不了解就无法发现的综合意义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there's a synthesis in that title that you might miss unless you know what to look for.</p>
</details>

Nicholas Boggs: 绝对正确。当鲍德温感觉好些后，他们去徒步旅行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely. They were going on a hike when Bulvin felt better.</p>
</details>

据Lucian说，他们当时在一个冰川上，鲍德温差点摔倒，Lucian救了他。就在那一刻，他看到了雪中反射的光芒，他说：“这就是标题。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And supposedly this is what Lucien says. They were on a glacier and Baldwin almost fell and Lucian saved him. And it was at that moment he saw the light reflecting in the snow and he said that's the title.</p>
</details>

### 重新审视鲍德温：从愤怒到喜悦与联结

MJ Franklin: 也许只是我个人感受，但我发现思考鲍德温和爱，在我的脑海中是一种轻微的重新定义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And maybe it was just me, but I found like thinking about Bodwin and love in my mind to be a slight refraraming.</p>
</details>

因为在我读这本书之前，当我想到鲍德温时，我可能会想到他散文中那种正义的愤怒，或者他小说中那种诗意的忧郁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because when I thought of Bwin before I read read this book, I think I would have thought of his righteous fury for instance in his essays or with his fiction. I thought of like poetic somberness and I felt like he was writing for the lost boys.</p>
</details>

我感觉他的作品中有很多焦虑和悲剧，直到这本书，我才觉得“爱”不会是第一个浮现在我脑海中的词，但读完之后，它绝对是。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I feel like there's a lot of angst and tragedy and until this book I don't think that love would have been the first word that came to mind but after it it definitely is.</p>
</details>

Nicholas Boggs: 我们看到他出现在迪克·卡维特秀（Dick Cavett Show）上与William Buckley对话的视频片段，他看起来非常严肃和愤怒，这现在是他流行的形象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We see those video clips of him where he's on the Dick Cavage show with William Buckley and he seems very ceremonic and angry and these are the this is the popular vision of him now.</p>
</details>

但事实上，鲍德温的生活充满了欢乐、笑声、交流以及与他人的联结，这些人帮助他建立了可以写作的社群。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But in fact, Baldwin's life was full of joy and laughter and communion and connection with other people who are helping him create these communities where he could write.</p>
</details>

他去了伊斯坦布尔。在那里他完成了《另一个国家》（Another Country），在那里他写了高度政治化的《下一次将是烈火》（The Fire Next Time）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He went to Istanbul. That is where he finished another country. That is where he wrote the highly politicized the fire next time.</p>
</details>

所以这些爱情关系也使他能够撰写关于国内政治事件的文章。他需要与美国保持距离，正如他所说，才能写出关于美国的作品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So these love relationships were also enabling him to write about political events back home. He needed this distance from America as he put it in order to write about it.</p>
</details>

MJ Franklin: 如果我没记错的话，这是多少年来第一部关于鲍德温的主要传记？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And correct me if I'm wrong, but this is the first major biography of Baldwin in how long?</p>
</details>

Nicholas Boggs: 大约30年了，来自一家商业出版社。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In about 30 years from a trade press.</p>
</details>

MJ Franklin: 我想你在书中提到，在之前的传记中，并没有深入探讨他的浪漫关系或他的**酷儿身份**（Queerness: 指非异性恋或非顺性别身份）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think you mentioned in the book that in previous biographies there hasn't been a deep dive into his romantic relationships or into his queerness.</p>
</details>

Nicholas Boggs: 我不会说没有，只是没有像这本书这样深入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I wouldn't say it as not as deep as this one. No.</p>
</details>

MJ Franklin: 你认为这是为什么？是出于对他的一种敬意吗？是当时的恐同情绪吗？还是我们当时没有这些关系的相关材料、信息或知识？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why do you think that is? Was it out of a sense of difference to him? Is it the homophobia of the time? Is it just that we didn't have the material or information or knowledge of these relationships?</p>
</details>

Nicholas Boggs: 我不想对之前的传记作者说太多，但你必须记住它们是在什么时候写的，它们是在他去世后不久写的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think I don't want to speak too much about prior biographers, but you have to remember when they were written, they were written right after he died.</p>
</details>

当时有三本重要的书出版，其中David Leming是他的私人助理。David Leming确实写了这些关系，但他不得不使用化名来掩盖其中一些人的名字。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There were three important ones that came out and David Leming's he was his personal assistant. David Leming does write about these relationships, but he has to cloak some of their names in pseudonyms.</p>
</details>

那不是他的重点，但他确实整合了这些内容。他认识这些人，这非常重要，除了Yuron Kazak。

<p class="english-text">That wasn't his focus, but he definitely integrates them. He knew these people, and that's really important, except for Uron Kazak.</p>
</details>

但那是1994年。情况已经改变了。例如，**酷儿理论**（Queer Theory: 一种批判性理论，探讨性别、性取向和身份的社会建构）的兴起影响了人们审视生活的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But this was 1994. Things have changed. There was the rise of say even like queer theory which has impacted how people examine lives.</p>
</details>

我认为由于鲍德温拒绝了同性恋、异性恋和酷儿这些类别，这使得人们回避了深入探讨，因为当他与主要与女性交往的男性有关系时，你如何谈论这些关系？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think since Paulin rejected these categories of gay and straight and queer, it deflected away from this deep dive because how do you talk about these relationships when he's involved with men who are mostly involved with women?</p>
</details>

那是一个同性恋爱情故事吗？那是什么样的爱情故事？这是我在这本书中必须解决的问题，而且它也需要被解决。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is that a gay love story? What kind of love story is that? And that's something that I had to address in this book, but that needed to be addressed.</p>
</details>

### 鲍德温生命中的四位“爱之锚”

MJ Franklin: 这是一个非常棒的问题。你如何谈论这些关系？你做到这一点的方式之一就是围绕它们来组织这部传记。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That is such a great question. How do you talk about those relationships? And one of the ways that you do that is by organizing this biography around them.</p>
</details>

这本书分为四个主要部分，还有一个序言和一段插曲等等，但主要的四个部分是围绕着每一位爱人组织的。你已经提到了一些，但你能向我介绍这四位“爱之锚”吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The book is split into four sections and there's a prologue and an interlude and all that stuff, but the main four sections are organized around each of the lovers. You've mentioned a few of them already, but can you introduce me to our four anchors?</p>
</details>

Nicholas Boggs: 当然。第一位是Buford Delaney。他是一位极其重要的画家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure. So, the first one is Buford Delaney. Extremely important painter.</p>
</details>

他的画作现在能卖到数百万美元。但在当时，除了在格林威治村，他相对来说并不为人所知。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">His paintings now sell for millions of dollars. But at the time he was relatively unknown except in the village.</p>
</details>

他是一位古怪而著名的角色。他认识Marian Anderson和Canada Lee。他向鲍德温介绍了爵士乐和蓝调音乐家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He was an eccentric well-known character. He knew Marian Anderson Canada Lee. He jazz and blues musicians who he introduced Baldwin to.</p>
</details>

但最重要的是，他向鲍德温介绍了如何以艺术家的视角看待世界，并成为了他的精神导师。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But most importantly he introduced Baldwin to the idea of how to see the world as an artist and he became his kind of spiritual father.</p>
</details>

Buford对鲍德温有浪漫兴趣，但他没有强求。他扮演了另一个终身的角色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now Buford was interested romantically in Bowwin but he didn't push it. He took on this other role that was lifelong.</p>
</details>

第二个人物是Lucian，当鲍德温搬到巴黎并爱上他时。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second figure is Lucenne when he moves to Paris and falls in love with him.</p>
</details>

第三个人物是Engin Jazar，一位土耳其演员，鲍德温在格林威治村遇到他，他在演员工作室的演出中扮演了Giovani。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The third figure is Engin Jazar, a Turkish actor that Baldwin met in Greenwich Village who played Giovani, an actor studio rendition.</p>
</details>

鲍德温爱上了他，但他们称彼此为“血兄弟”。他们割破手臂，混合了彼此的血液。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Baldwin fell in love with him, but they called each other blood brothers. They cut their arms and mixed their blood together.</p>
</details>

鲍德温跟着他去了伊斯坦布尔，在那里他完成了之前无法完成的《另一个国家》，还写了《下一次将是烈火》，并在那里度过了那个十年大部分时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And Baldwin followed him to Istanbul where he finished another country, which he couldn't do, and also wrote The Fire Next Time, and spent most of that decade living there.</p>
</details>

他称伊斯坦布尔为家。他会回来参加华盛顿大游行，回来参加政治活动，但大部分时间他都在伊斯坦布尔生活，并培育着这个支持他的社群。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He called it his home. He'd come back to march on Washington. He'd come back for political engagements, but mostly he was living and fostering this sustaining community in Istanul.</p>
</details>

所以这是这本书中非常重要的一部分。最后一位是Yuron Kazak，这位法国艺术家，鲍德温将《如果比尔街能说话》（If Beale Street Could Talk）献给了他，并与他合作了几个项目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that's a really important part of the book. And then the last one is Yuran Kazak, the French artist who he dedicated if Beielree could talk to and collaborated with on a couple projects.</p>
</details>

MJ Franklin: 我们将继续我们的对话，但首先我想我们应该稍作休息。

<p class="english-text">We're going to continue with our conversation, but first I think we should take a quick break.</p>

</details>

MJ Franklin: 我们回来了。这里是《书评播客》。我是MJ Franklin，我正在与作者尼古拉斯·博格斯谈论他的詹姆斯·鲍德温新传记《鲍德温：一个爱情故事》。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we're back. This is the book review podcast. I'm MJ Franklin and I'm talking to the author Nicholas Bogs about his new James Baldwin biography, Baldwin, a love story.</p>
</details>

这本书，我认为，有趣地、挑衅地、富有启发性地（虽然这不是一个词，但我在这里要用它），围绕着这四位男性构建。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This book is, I think, interestingly, provocatively, inspiredly, that's not a word, but I'm going to use it here, structured around these four men.</p>
</details>

你能谈谈为什么决定以这种方式而不是其他方式来构建这本书吗？比如，不仅仅是典型的按时间顺序叙述。为什么以这种方式构建这本书？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can you talk to me about that decision to structure the book that way versus another way? Either just a typical chronological walkthrough. Why structure the book that way?</p>
</details>

Nicholas Boggs: Toni Morrison有一句名言，大意是你必须写你想读的书。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tony Morrison has that famous quote that you have to write the book that you want to read.</p>
</details>

所以当我大学时读到这些关于鲍德温的重要早期传记时，它们给了我们很多重要的信息，但似乎在这些爱情关系周围存在一些非常显著的空白。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so when I read these important early biographies of Baldwin when I was in college, they gave us so much important information, but it just seemed like there were these gaps around these love relationships that were very striking.</p>
</details>

因为对我来说，很明显其中一些人是他的爱人，而且他的所有作品都与爱有关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because to me it seemed obvious that some of them were his lovers, but also it seemed like all of his writings about love.</p>
</details>

他的小说都是爱情故事。他的政治理念根植于这样一个观念：黑人和白人美国人必须像恋人一样团结起来，才能改变世界。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">His novels are all love stories. His political his politics is rooted in this idea that black and white Americans must come together, as he puts it, like lovers in order to change the world.</p>
</details>

所以，将他的作品中的爱与他的生活中不那么明确的爱分开讨论，这似乎很奇怪，我们并没有将它们结合起来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it was it seemed odd to have this bifurcation where we're talking about love in his work. We're talking about it in his life, but not really and we're not bringing them together.</p>
</details>

MJ Franklin: 那么我想回到最初的问题，是什么启发了这本书的创作？我知道它是围绕爱构建的，因为存在那个空白，但当你开始写作时，是因为你看到了这个空白并想填补它，还是有一个不同的起点？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I want to loop back around then based off of that and just ask what inspired this book in the first place? I know it's structured around love because there was that gap, but when you set out to start writing, was it because you saw this gap and wanted to fill it in or was there a different starting point?</p>
</details>

Nicholas Boggs: 在我的潜意识中，肯定有一个不同的起点，那可能就是当时正在发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There was definitely a different starting point in my unconscious that probably was what was happening.</p>
</details>

我大学时在耶鲁大学上了一门詹姆斯·鲍德温的课，并在**肖姆堡黑人文化研究中心**（Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture: 纽约公共图书馆的一个研究中心，致力于非洲裔文化和历史）发现了一本绝版的儿童读物《小人儿，小人儿》（Little Man, Little Man）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I in college I took a class on James Baldwin at Yale and at the Bicki I discovered this out of print children's book Little Man Little Man.</p>
</details>

我给David Leming写了一封电子邮件，问他是否知道Yuron Kazak这个人物的任何信息。他说他从未见过他，他认为他已经去世了，他也不知道还有谁活着见过他。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I wrote an email to David Leming asking him if he knew anything about this Yuran Kazak character and he said I'd never met him. I think he's dead. I don't know anybody else alive who met him.</p>
</details>

但几年后，2003年我在读研究生时，我给巴黎的艺术史学家写信，问他们是否知道他的任何信息。几周后，我的单身公寓电话响了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But a few years later I wrote to art historians in Paris in 2003 when I was in grad school asking if they knew anything about him. A few weeks later, the phone rings in my studio apartment.</p>
</details>

电话里传来一个沙哑而坦率的声音：“我是Yuron Kazak。我还活着。来巴黎吧。我有很多关于吉米的故事要告诉你。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's It says this raspy, frankly, accepted voice. I'm Yurin Kazak. I'm alive. Come to Paris. I have many stories to tell you about Jimmy.</p>
</details>

所以，这本书的创作是自然而然地从与他见面开始的，一路了解了他与鲍德温关系的复杂性，让《小人儿，小人儿》重新出版，然后从那里按时间倒推。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, organically, it grew out of meeting him, learning along the way the complications of his relationship with Baldwin, bringing Little Man back into print, and it moved backwards chronologically from there.</p>
</details>

### 挖掘未被讲述的故事：研究与发现

MJ Franklin: 有趣。你能把我们带入你的内心吗？你接到这个电话：“我是Yuron Kazak，失踪已久的Yuron Kazak。我有很多关于吉米的故事。”你当时在想什么？接下来发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Interesting. Can you bring us into your head? You get this call. I'm Yuran Kha'Zac, the long lost Yoran Kaak. I have a lot of stories about Jimmy. what is going on in your head and what happens next?</p>
</details>

Nicholas Boggs: 我申请了我的第三张信用卡，然后就去了那里。我看到了他的展览，见到了他，他是一个极具魅力的**局外人艺术家**（Outsider Artist: 指未经正规艺术训练，其作品风格独特且常与主流艺术脱节的艺术家）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I sign up for my third credit card and I head over there and I see his exhibition and I meet him and he's this intensely charismatic outsider artist.</p>
</details>

他住在托斯卡纳，和他的妻子一起，没有电，没有自来水，用画作和村民交换物品，生活非常古怪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He lives in he lived in Tuscany with his wife with no electricity, no running water, trading paintings with the villagers, really eccentric life.</p>
</details>

他曾是Balthus的门生，一个非常有趣的人。他谈论鲍德温的方式都充满了爱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He'd been a protege of Baltus, just a really interesting guy. And the way that he talked about Baldwin was all about love.</p>
</details>

他说鲍德温只是一个萨满和演员。他喜欢看鲍德温对着镜子朗读自己的作品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He said he was just a sheaman and an actor. He loved to watch him reading his writing in front of a mirror.</p>
</details>

他开玩笑说鲍德温有一辆棕色奔驰，他们会开着它四处转，鲍德温称之为“鲍德温棕”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He joked about he had a brown Mercedes. They would drive around and Baldwin called it Baldwin Brown.</p>
</details>

他们的一位朋友有一只黑色拉布拉多犬，鲍德温会告诉他：“你不能叫它黑色，你要叫它有色。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A friend of theirs had a black Labrador and Baldwin would say to him, "You don't call it black, you call it colored."</p>
</details>

他们的整个关系是一种非常欢乐、幽默、充满爱意的合作关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">His whole their relationship was a very jovial, jokey, loving collaborative relationship.</p>
</details>

MJ Franklin: 当你和他交谈并听到所有这些故事时，你是否立刻就知道“我有一本书可写了”？还是这个决定后来才出现？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And did you know right away when you're talking to him and getting all of these stories, I have a book? or did that decision that did that come later?</p>
</details>

Nicholas Boggs: 从那第一次回来后，我在日记中写道：

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In my journal coming back from that first time, I wrote something like,</p>
</details>

“这是我一生中最不可思议的经历，但我不知道该如何处理它。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"This has been the most incredible experience of my life, but I have no idea what to do with it."</p>
</details>

我确实知道我想让《小人儿，小人儿》重新出版，我们最终在2018年与Congratulations Press合作做到了这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I did know I wanted to bring Little Man, Little Man back into print, which we ended up doing in 2018 with Congratulations Press.</p>
</details>

谢谢。那是杜克大学出版社（Duke University Press），鲍德温的侄女Aisha和侄子Tan贡献了优美的后记和前言。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you. It was Duke University Press and Baldwin's niece and nephew Aisha and Tan contributed beautiful afterwards and forwards.</p>
</details>

所以，那是一个重要的时刻。那也大约是2017年肖姆堡档案开放的时候。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, that was a big moment. That was also around the time that the Shawnberg archives became available in 2017.</p>
</details>

这种巧合让我思考，等等，我只是要写这段关系，还是有更多值得谈论的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that kind of confluence made me think, wait a second, am I going to write about just this one relationship or is there more to talk about here?</p>
</details>

MJ Franklin: 你是什么时候意识到，什么时候决定“还有更多”的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when did you realize when did you decide there is more there?</p>
</details>

Nicholas Boggs: 我当时在巴塞罗那的一个艺术家驻留项目，和我的经纪人谈话。她说：“这本书还有什么？不仅仅是Yuron Kazak。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was talking to my agent and I was at an artist residency in Barcelona and she said, "What else is it about? It's not just Yarn Kazak."</p>
</details>

她几乎是在责骂我，因为她非常沮丧。我说：“嗯，它是关于关系和爱的。”她说：“他还爱过谁？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And she was really almost berating me because she was so frustrated and I said, "Well, it's about relationships and love." And she said, "Who else did he love?"</p>
</details>

就在那时我意识到：“哦，等等。他爱过Buford。他爱过Lucian。”我当时还没有意识到Engin Jazar。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's when I kind of realized, "Oh, wait a second. He loved Buford. He loved Lucien. And I hadn't realized about Enginia.</p>
</details>

但我意识到，有一条明显的贯穿线。酷儿生活，我们在某些方面是逆向思考的。我相信我们所有人都不以同样线性的方式思考。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I realized that there was this obvious throughine. Queer life. We think backwards in some ways. We don't think in the same all of us linear way I believe.</p>
</details>

我想这就是发生在我身上的事情。我是在倒着进入这个故事的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's I think what happened to me. I was backing into this story.</p>
</details>

MJ Franklin: 多说一点。你说的“酷儿生活不以线性方式思考”是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Say more about that. What do you mean we don't think linear for a queer life?</p>
</details>

Nicholas Boggs: 那种“你出生、结婚、生子”的正常人生故事，是一种非常线性的规范叙事，而鲍德温就没有过这种生活。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The sort of normal life story that you're born, you get married to somebody else, you have kids. This is a very linear normative narrative which is not one that Baldwin lived for example.</p>
</details>

看看他的人生。他正在构建这些替代性的亲属结构，与不同的男性和女性，他们在他生命中循环往复，来来去去，支撑着他。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look at his life. He's constructing these alternative kinship structures with different men and women that circle back around that come back into his life that leave that sustain him.</p>
</details>

他并没有思考，他确实对孩子很感兴趣，也希望自己有孩子，但他明白他对未来的贡献不一定是生物学上的，而是作为一名有远见的艺术家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And he wasn't thinking he was really interested in children and wish that he did but he understood that his contribution to the future wasn't necessarily a biological one but was as this visionary as an artist.</p>
</details>

这给自己带来了多么巨大的压力，但同时，这种抱负也令人瞩目，能够知道“我的角色是**远见者**（Visionary: 具有非凡洞察力和预见未来能力的人）”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What a incredible amount of pressure both to put onto yourself but then also that ambition too is I think just remarkable to know my role here is visionary.</p>
</details>

我不知道他是否会这样说，他称自己为“见证者”，他想成为一名作家，一名小说家，那是他人生中的主要目标，那是他所看到的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know if he would say that he called himself a witness and he wanted to be a writer a novelist that was his main goal in life that's what he saw.</p>

然后，当他1957年南下旅行，遇到Martin Luther King，看到燃烧的十字架时，他明白了Sterling Brown和其他人一直在告诉他的，凭借他作为演说家和作家的技能，他有一个独特的机会为这个国家的未来和民权运动做出贡献，他有些不情愿地承担了这项任务。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And then when he went and traveled the south in 1957 and met Martin Luther King and saw the burning crosses he understood as Sterling Brown and others have been telling him that with his skill as an ortor and a writer. He had had a unique opportunity to contribute to the future of this country and the civil rights movement and he took that up somewhat reluctantly.</p>
</details>

MJ Franklin: 鲍德温本人对这些男性和“爱”的观念正在塑造他这一事实有多么自觉？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How conscious was Baldwin himself of the fact that these men and the idea of love was what was shaping him?</p>
</details>

Nicholas Boggs: 哦，我想他非常清楚。他在《街上没有名字》（No Name in the Street）中写过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, I think he was very aware of it. He writes about it in No Name in the Street.</p>
</details>

他写了Lucian，以及爱上Lucian如何将他从肤色的陷阱中解放出来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He writes about Lucien and how falling in love with Lucien freed him from the trap of color.</p>
</details>

他在写给Mary Painter的信中，非常明显地看出他的创作过程与这些分手完全纠缠在一起。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He writes about how in these letters to Mary Painter, it becomes very obvious that his creative process is completely wound up in these breakups.</p>
</details>

他把写作过程比作一种分娩。这些关系及其动荡似乎让他能够“分娩”出他的艺术作品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He talked about the writing process as a kind of giving birth. And it's almost like these relationships and their turmoil allowed him to give birth to his works of art.</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Which when I was reading this in the book, I found to be so fascinating and so jaw-dropping.</p>

你曾提到并强调，在《如果比尔街能说话》中有一段文字，几乎是他在一封信中表达的关于Lucian的**逐字记录**（Verbatim: 准确地重复原话或原文）。

<p class="english-text">I put them side by side and the reason I did that was to show this idea that not that looking at his love life is somehow salacious or something.</p>

不，我们无法理解他的创作过程，这些句子是如何产生的。他如何将他与Yuron的跨种族、酷儿（无论你想怎么称呼它）的爱情故事，转化成《如果比尔街能说话》中Tish和Fonnie之间美丽的黑人爱情故事。

对于鲍德温来说，所有这些不同的层面总是同时发生的。为了理解它们，我们必须审视他的爱人，他的爱情生活。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That for Baldwin, all these different registers were always happening at the same time. And in order to understand them, we have to look at his lovers, his love life.</p>

<p class="english-text">Sure. There's a few, but the one that I think was really life-changing for me was recall that Yuran Kaak died in 2005, but I interviewed him, but I hadn't been able to ask him all the questions I wanted to.</p>

<p class="english-text">We've gotten many done, but I was interviewing his wife as well, which was wonderful. And she invited me to come see her in Tuscanyany in 2018 to see the original drafts from Little Man, but also any other documents she had.</p>

我还想问她更多问题。所以，我们去了那里。她住在托斯卡纳，在她的卧室里，她拿出所有这些文件和图片。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I also wanted to ask her more questions. So, we go there. She lives in in Tuscanyany, and in her bedroom, she's thrown out all these documents and images.</p>

当她找到一封鲍德温在20世纪70年代早期写给她丈夫的情书时，托斯卡纳山丘上的夕阳正在西沉。那是一首七页长的情诗，上面夹着一个生锈的金属回形针。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the sun is setting over the Tuscan Hills when she finds a love letter that Baldwin wrote to her husband in the early 1970s that there was a seven-page love poem with a rusty metal paperclip.</p>
</details>

她已经40年没见过它了，它是用法语写的。所以她为我把它翻译回了英语，内容全是关于思念。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">She hadn't seen it in 40 years and it was written in French. So she translated it back into English for me and it was all about yearning.</p>

这首诗叫做《萨特尼亚》（Satnia），因为他们会去这个温泉度假。然后鲍德温会回到圣保罗德旺斯，Yuron会回到托斯卡纳。

<details>

<p class="english-text">It's called Satnia because they would go to this hot spring for their getaways and then Baldwin would return to St. Paul Devance and Yuron would go back to Tuscanyany.</p>

所以这首诗都是关于醒来。鲍德温醒来，想着他。你吃了吗？你刮胡子了吗？我正在读你的星座。我正在读我的星座。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And so the poem is all about waking up. Baldwin's waking up and thinking about him. Have you eaten yet? Have you shaved yet? I'm reading your horoscope. I'm reading my horoscope.</p>

反复出现的句子是“来我身边。来我身边。回家。”当她读完时，夕阳正在西沉。

<p class="english-text">And she says, "This poem makes me sad for Jimmy" is how she put it.</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh my gosh. I find that that is very fair. But also one of the things I loved about this book and I'm grateful to this book for is just how you took that sheer amount of research and gave it to someone like me, someone who loves Baldwin but is not a Baldwin scholar.</p>

这本书给人的感觉是如此易懂和可读，但同时又聪明且具有学术性。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Was that something that you were conscious of while you were writing? Were you thinking of the reader? What kind of reader were you thinking of? Can you tell me more?</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, I think it's that Tony Morrison quote. Write the book that you want to read.</p>

<p class="english-text">This is the book that I wish I could have read when I was coming out in college when I was reading Baldwin.</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What I wanted to I definitely wanted it to be accessible. I wanted it to be told through stories, but I didn't want it to lose the kind of depth and rigor that Baldwin's work demands.</p>

所以，听到你有这样的体验，我非常欣慰，因为找到这种平衡非常困难。

<p class="english-text">So, I'm really gratified to hear that you had that experience because it was very hard to find that balance.</p>

我写完了关于Buford的第一本书，我真的很挣扎。这很讽刺，因为鲍德温在那一部分也在努力寻找自己的声音，对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I wrote the whole first book one Buford and I really struggled. It was ironic cuz Baldwin was struggling to find his voice in that section, right?</p>

### 写作过程中的挑战与收获

MJ Franklin: 这太有趣了。你提到你在那部分挣扎。还有其他部分让你挣扎吗？或者有没有其他部分是你觉得信手拈来，觉得“哦，这个场景，这个画面，我明白了。我找到了完美的放置位置”？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's so interesting. You mentioned that you struggle with that part. Are there other parts that you struggle with or are there other parts that just came to you that you're like, "Oh, this scene, this image, I get it. I have the perfect place for it."</p>

是的。跟我谈谈你在写作过程中的挣扎和成功。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Talk to me about the struggles and triumphs as you were writing.</p>

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, that that scene where he meets Lucenne was so fun to write because he's a it's a gay bar and I tried to make it almost like a film.</p>

另外，书的最后一部分我以一个角色的身份进入，这在风格上是一个挑战，但我也觉得很重要。

<p class="english-text">Also, the last part of the book I kind of enter as a character and that was stylistically challenged and I also felt important.</p>
</details>

我想展示，当你写传记时，它不仅仅是一个无缝展开的叙事，特别是当你写的是被边缘化的人物时，无论是由于种族还是性取向。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I wanted to show that when you're writing a biography, it's not just this seamless narrative that unspools, especially if you're writing about marginalized figures, whether because of race or sexuality.</p>
</details>

当我不得不进入档案时，我基本上不得不花费我的一生去查阅这些档案，如果把它写成一个整洁简单的叙事，我认为那将是对鲍德温生活现实的一种不忠。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when I had to go into the archives like I had to spend my entire life basically going into these archives put it as this neat easy narrative I think would have done a disservice to the reality of Baldwin's life.</p>

以及他的生活在某些方面是多么艰难，但讲述这些被抹去或难以挖掘的故事又是多么具有挑战性。

<details>

<p class="english-text">and how difficult his life was in some ways but how challenging it is to tell these stories that have been erased or are hard to unearth.</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you mentioned you're not doing it again but I think you did it superbly here was there anything that you learned about the art of biography about yourself as a writer through the process of crafting this book.</p>

<p class="english-text">And then I went and got my MFA afterwards, which is a little bit crazy, but I feel like not that school you need to go to school to do these things, but I did.</p>

所以，这是一个有些独特的情况，一个学者离开了学术，但将这种技能带入了一部传记。

<p class="english-text">And similarly to learning about yourself as a writer in the process was there anything that you learned about Baldwin that changed your thinking you mentioned going to the places where he wrote and going to the writer same writer's residency I'm just wondering wondering as you were doing this deep dive, did anything change in your thinking about Baldwin?</p>
</details>

MJ Franklin: 同样，在写作过程中，你作为一名作家学到了关于自己的东西，那么你有没有学到关于鲍德温的什么，改变了你的看法？你提到去他写作的地方，去同一个作家驻留地。我只是想知道，在你深入研究的过程中，你对鲍德温的看法有没有改变？

特别是三篇：《粉碎毒蛇》（To Crush a Serpent）、《美国男子气概理想中的怪胎》（Freaks in the American Ideal of Manhood），以及他的《票价》（The Price of the Ticket）的导言，因为这是年长的鲍德温回顾自己生活的地方。

MJ Franklin: 我喜欢这个。但“所有作品”这个答案我觉得也很公平。

<p class="english-text">I one of my favorite of his books and one that I keep on my desk at home is the price of the ticket cuz it's this giant omnibus collection that collects what 40 years of his essays.</p>

<p class="english-text">If anyone is new to James Baldwin, where would you recommend they start?</p>
</details>

如果有人刚接触詹姆斯·鲍德温，你会推荐他们从哪里开始？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I recommend they start with Notes of a Native Son because this is I think one of the most important quote unquote personal essays that they've read and it's autobiographical in the sense that it tells the story of his father's death, his father's funeral, but it also helps us understand the kind of the roots of Baldwin grappling with American racism and why he had to leave the country and why eventually he became the writer he was.</p>
</details>

Nicholas Boggs: 我推荐他们从《土生子的笔记》（Notes of a Native Son）开始，因为我认为这是他们读过的最重要的“个人散文”之一，它具有自传性质，讲述了他父亲的去世和葬礼的故事，但它也帮助我们理解鲍德温与美国种族主义斗争的根源，以及他为何不得不离开这个国家，以及他最终为何成为了他那样的作家。

<p class="english-text">Is there a hidden gem, an underappreciated Baldwin work that you wish had more shine?</p>

<p class="english-text">Some people like Robert Jones have talked about this and John Keane, but I do believe that his novel Just Above My Head is a forgotten gem in a way.</p>
</details>

Nicholas Boggs: 一些人，比如Robert Jones和John Keane，也谈论过这个问题，但我确实认为他的小说《就在我头顶》（Just Above My Head）在某种程度上是一颗被遗忘的宝石。

<p class="english-text">It was written about pretty negatively when it came out, but there's some absolutely gorgeous writing in it, and it's again really groundbreaking.</p>

<p class="english-text">One of the things I love about Baldwin, a love story, is that it teaches you how to read Baldwin.</p>
</details>

MJ Franklin: 我喜欢《鲍德温：一个爱情故事》的一点是，它教你如何阅读鲍德温。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For instance, you have a passage when you're discussing a fire next time you write, "Finally," and what will become some of his most famous lines with their cany slippage between the us and we of black Americans, white Americans, and all Americans, a rhetorical strategy he had been building for years.</p>
</details>

例如，你在讨论《下一次将是烈火》时有一段文字写道：“最终，他最著名的一些句子，巧妙地在黑人美国人、白人美国人和所有美国人之间的‘我们’和‘他们’之间滑动，这是他多年来一直在构建的修辞策略。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That idea, the slippage of the us and the we, that close reading made me think, I'm going to go back and read everything Baldwin has written and keep an eye out for specifically that.</p>
</details>

“我们”和“他们”之间的这种滑动，这种细致的解读让我觉得，我要回去读鲍德温写过的所有东西，并特别留意这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Given that, I'm curious for anybody who is reading Baldwin, what's something that you think that they should look out for in addition to the us and the Wii, but what's something that you think, oh, Baldwin was really experimenting with blank or this was a strategy that he perfected throughout his work.</p>
</details>

鉴于此，我很好奇对于任何正在阅读鲍德温作品的人来说，除了“我们”和“他们”之外，你认为他们还应该注意什么？你认为鲍德温真正在尝试什么，或者这是他在整个作品中完善的策略？

</details>

他如何在散文中呈现美国无辜的这个问题，以及他如何通过David将其转化为叙事？

<p class="english-text">For example, David cannot accept him sexuality, but he also can't really come to terms with his whiteness.</p>
</details>

例如，David无法接受自己的性取向，但他也不能真正正视自己的白人身份。

然后我的最后一个问题，这不关乎鲍德温的整体作品。它关乎你自己的书，这会是一个奇怪的问题，但请耐心听我说。
