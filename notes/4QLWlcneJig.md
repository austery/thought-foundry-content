### 副业致富：低成本创业的时代机遇

许多人正在寻找通过**副业**（Side Hustle: 在主业之外开展的额外工作或业务以赚取收入）获得**被动收入**（Passive Income: 无需持续投入大量精力即可获得的收入）的机会。这就像一场“金融奥运会”，而且现在比以往任何时候都更容易参与。我所讨论的90%的创业想法都可以在500美元或更少的预算下启动，并且在晚上和周末有足够的时间来完成。在我面前的三个手提箱里，放着三笔不同金额的钱。在这次对话中，我将随机递给你一个盒子，你的任务是告诉我你会用这笔钱启动什么样的业务。听起来不错，我们开始吧。Chris Kerner被誉为“副业之王”，他已经启动了80多个业务，在此过程中赚取了数百万美元。现在，这位连续创业家将教我们如何培养商业思维，并以少量资金启动简单、被忽视但有利可图的 ventures。

<p class="english-text">A lot of people are looking for passive income from side hustles. Yeah, it's the financial ompic and it's more accessible than ever. Like 90% of the ideas I talk about can be launched with $500 or less. And there's enough time in the day to do these on the nights and weekends. So in these three suitcases in front of me, I have three different amounts of money. And during this conversation, I'm going to pass you a box at random. And your job is to tell me what kind of business you would start with that amount of money. Sounds good. Let's do this. Known as the king of side hustles, Chris Kerner has launched over 80 businesses, earning millions in the process. And now, the serial entrepreneur is going to teach us how to adopt a business mindset and launch simple, overlooked, but profitable ventures with little money.</p>

我们中的许多人面临财务困境，并将副业视为解决方案。对我来说，从小家境贫寒，创业让我能够掌控自己的人生，并将其塑造成我想要的样子。这一切始于我9岁时，当时我想要一辆红色的**Schwin自行车**（Schwin Bicycle: 美国著名自行车品牌）。我的朋友和邻居都有自行车，但我父母没有钱给我买。我住在高尔夫球场对面，高尔夫球经常飞到我家院子里。我还会去邻居家院子和街对面，在水沟里挖高尔夫球，然后开始卖它们。那是我的第一笔生意。它教会我，创业是平易近人的，我们都有想法，但通常不会付诸行动。为什么？我认为首要原因是他们害怕别人怎么看。其次是他们没有工具，或者没有将工具与想法联系起来。如果我们能克服这些，那么世界就是我们的**囊中之物**（The World Is Our Oyster: 形容机会无限，世界任你闯荡）。

<p class="english-text">Many of us struggle financially and they see a side hustle as a solution to that. Like for me, growing up kind of poor, business allowed me to take hold of my life and make it what I wanted it to be. And it started when I was 9 years old and wanting a Red Schwin bicycle. My friends had a bicycle. My neighbors had a bicycle and my parents didn't have money for it. But I lived across the street from a golf course and these golf balls would fly in my yard and I would go to my neighbor's yard and go across the street, dig through the ditches and I'd pull out all these golf balls and I started selling them. That was my first business. That taught me that business is approachable and we all have ideas, but we usually don't do anything about it. Why? I think number one, they're afraid of what people think. Number two is they don't have the tools or they're not connecting the tools with the ideas. If we can get over those, the world is our oyster at that point.</p>

### 创业心法：利润优先与克服恐惧

主持人：我这里有1000美元。你会启动什么副业？

<details>

<p class="english-text">I have $1,000. What side hustle would you start?</p>
</details>

我首先想到的是我目前最喜欢的商业想法。这是一个零员工的业务，利润丰厚。那么，你认为热爱你所做的事情对成功有多重要？我的建议是：**忽略激情，追逐利润，直到你能负担得起追逐激情**。需要商业伙伴吗？不需要。如果你看看有联合创始人的公司失败率统计数据，它明显高于独资公司。那么，如何验证一个商业想法呢？如果我只能选择一个工具，那就是四分之一的人每天都在使用的那个。那就是你所需要的一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first thing that comes to mind is my favorite business idea of all right now. This is a zero employee business. It's highly profitable and that would be so how important is it for you to love the thing to be successful at it? Ignore passion. Follow the profit until you can afford to follow your passion. Do they need a business partner? No. If you look at the stats on business failure rates with companies that have co-founders, it's significantly higher than companies that have solo founders. And how does someone validate a business idea? If I had to pick one tool, it's one that one in four humans use every day. That's everything you need right there.</p>

Chris，你是谁？你的使命是什么？

<p class="english-text">Chris, who are you and what is the mission that you're on?</p>
</details>

我是一位父亲，一位丈夫，也是一位连续创业家。我热爱谈论创业，启动业务，并激励他人做同样的事情。创业给了我一切。从小家境贫寒，创业是我的出路，是我掌控自己生活并将其塑造成我想要的样子的方式。我对此心存感激。我只是喜欢谈论它。这是我唯一了解的事情，我无法和你谈论历史或营养，但谈到商业，我就是热爱它，我也希望其他人能热爱它。你是如何在商界闯出名堂的？因为我最近经常听到你的名字。人们称你为“副业之王”。这名声从何而来？我想我现在只是把我的生活发布到互联网上。我一直在测试、启动和创办企业，但只是在过去几年才开始发布这些内容。我并没有刻意想成为“副业之王”，这不是我曾有意塑造的品牌，但我认为人们把我所做的事情看作是副业，所以他们就这么称呼它。但我认为任何事情都是可以扩展的。任何副业都可以成为一个价值数百万美元的企业。我们生活在一个拥有80亿人口的星球上，我们彼此相连，任何事情都可以被扩展。

<p class="english-text">I am a father. I am a husband and I'm a serial entrepreneur and I love talking about business and starting businesses and inspiring other people to do the same. Why business has given me everything. Um, growing up kind of poor, it was my outlet. It was my way of just kind of taking hold of my life and making it what I wanted it to be. And I have immense gratitude for that. Um, and I love I just love talking about it. I it's the only thing I know you I can't talk to you about history or nutrition or anything, but when it comes to business, I just love it and I want other people to love it as well. How have you made your name in the world of business? Because I've heard your name a lot recently. People call you the king of side hustles. Where has this come from? I think I just published my life on the internet now. Um, I I'm always testing and launching and starting businesses, but only over the last couple years have I started publishing that. And I didn't try to be like the king of side hustles. That's not something that I've ever like intentionally tried to brand myself as, but I think people see what I do as a side hustle and they call it that. But I think that anything is scalable. Any side hustle could could be a multi-million dollar business. Um, I mean, we we live on a planet with eight billion people and we're all connected and anything can be scaled.</p>
</details>

你现在制作了很多内容，所以你可能通过反馈循环，了解了你所说、所做和创造的哪些内容能引起人们的共鸣，以及为什么会引起共鸣。比如，我的受众正在寻找的核心是什么？作为人类，我们都想要**灵丹妙药**（Silver Bullet: 指能解决所有问题的简单而神奇的方法）。我们想要解决问题的方法，我们中的许多人面临财务困境，他们将副业视为一种出路或解决方案。我认为每个人都有想法，但大多数人对执行这些想法非常犹豫。所以，当他们看到像我这样的人自由地执行所有想法时，希望能打开他们的思维，帮助他们以不同的方式或更平易近人的方式看待自己的想法，也许能给他们信心去做同样的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you make a lot of content now, so you've probably had a bit of a feedback loop in terms of understanding what it is that you say and do and create that's resonant with people and also why it's resonant like what is the crux of what people like my audiences are are looking for. As humans, we all want a silver bullet. We want a solution to our problems and many of us struggle financially um and they see a side hustle as as an outlet to that or as a solution to that. I think everyone has ideas. um most people are very hesitant to execute on those ideas. And so when they see someone like me freely executing on all the ideas, it hopefully it opens their mind and helps them look at their ideas in a different way or a more approachable way and maybe gives them confidence to do the same.</p>
</details>

在我面前的盒子里，有三笔不同金额的钱：500美元、1000美元和5000美元。在这次对话中，我将随机递给你一个盒子，你的任务是告诉我你会用这笔钱启动什么样的业务，因为我知道我的受众中，很多人都对有一天自己创业感兴趣。我特意使用了较低的金额，只是为了让他们尽可能容易地接触到创业。所以，我们会在某个时候这样做。我会把盒子递给你，你给我三个商业想法，分别用500美元、1000美元和5000美元启动。但我想了解一下你，以及你创办的业务，以及你所取得的各种成功。那么，你能给我一个概览吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the boxes in front of me here, I have three different amounts of money. $500, I think I have $1,000, and $5,000. And during this conversation, I'm going to pass you a box at random. And your job is to tell me what kind of business you would start with that amount of money because I know my audience, you know, they're many of them are interested in starting their own business one day. And I use specifically sort of low amounts of money just to make it as accessible to them as possible. So, we will do that at some point. I'll pass you the boxes. You give me three business ideas. You'll start with $500, $1,000, and $5,000. Um, but I want to get a view on on you and the businesses that you've started and the sort of the variety of success you've had. So, can you give me an overview?</p>
</details>

好的。我9岁的时候住在犹他州，我家对面就是高尔夫球场，高尔夫球经常飞到我家院子里。我不知道是什么给了我这个想法，但我开始卖它们。我只是想赚钱买一辆自行车。我想要一辆红色的Schwin自行车，我的朋友和邻居都有自行车，但我父母没有钱给我买。所以，无论出于什么原因，我把草地上的白色高尔夫球和钱联系起来了。我会去邻居家院子，穿过街道，在水沟里挖出所有这些高尔夫球。我会把它们洗干净。然后我在我家门前立了一块巨大的胶合板，上面写着“高尔夫球，三美元一个”。那是我的第一笔生意。当时，这很正常，很自然。我不知道有什么不同。现在我有一个9岁的孩子，我做那件事的时候也是9岁。我们现在住在一条繁忙的路上，当时我也住在一条繁忙的路上。想到他像我当年那样，在自家门口和穿着Polo衫的成年人讨价还价，简直不可思议。但那正是我当时在做的事情。那件事在我心里种下了一颗种子，教会我创业是平易近人的。最好是平易近人。平易近人和可扩展性可以是同一回事，它们不必相互矛盾。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, I was 9 years old living in Utah and I lived across the street from a golf course and these golf balls would fly in my yard and I don't know what gave me the idea, but I started selling them. Um, I just wanted money for a bike. I wanted this Schwin bicycle and it was red and my friends had a bicycle, my neighbors had a bicycle and my parents didn't have money for it. And so for whatever reason, I connected that white golf ball in my grass with money. And I would go to my neighbor's yards, I'd go across the street, I'd dig through the ditches, and I'd pull out all these golf balls. I'd wash them. And then I put up this huge piece of plywood in front of my house that said golf balls three for a dollar. And that was my first business. And at the time, it was just normal. It was natural. Uh I didn't know any different. And now I have a 9-year-old, and I was nine when I did that. And we live on a busy road today. I lived on a busy road then. And the thought of him like negotiating, haggling with grown-ups wearing polo shirts on our doorstep is unfathomable. But that's what I was doing. And that planted the seed that kind of taught me that business is approachable. Um, preferably it's approachable. Approachable and scalable can be the same thing. They don't have to be at odds with one another.</p>
</details>

那么，从那时起你创办了多少家企业？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, and how many businesses have you started since then?</p>
</details>

我数不清了。我有一个电子表格，但至少有80家。

<p class="english-text">I lose count. I have a spreadsheet. Um, but it's at least 80.</p>

<p class="english-text">And what's the what have the outcomes been? How much money have you made? What kind of how has that changed your life? What freedom has that given you?</p>
</details>

是的。所以，总的来说，所有这些业务累计产生了数亿美元的收入，以及数千万美元的利润。但从实际数字来看，大部分业务都被放弃了，或者**逐渐消亡**（Fizzled Out: 逐渐衰弱、失败或停止），或者失败了，或者机会成本太高，所以我转向了其他业务。这只是一个**数字游戏**（Numbers Game: 指成功概率低，需要大量尝试才能成功的活动）。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, cumulatively uh all of the businesses have generated low hundreds of millions of revenue. Um low tens of millions of profit. Um but on a real number basis, the majority of them have been abandoned or fizzled out or failed or there was too much opportunity cost so I pivoted to something else. Um, it's just a numbers game.</p>

我的生活非常棒。我们在20多岁的时候建了梦想中的房子。我们在20多岁的时候有了四个孩子。我们经常旅行。我结婚17年了。我们是一个非常亲密的家庭。我们经常旅行。我们住在一个好的学区，但我的孩子上公立学校，我们拥有一切所需，甚至更多，我们对此非常感激。

Um, we live in a good school district, but my kids go to public school and, um, we have everything we need and more, and we're very grateful for that.</p>

### 成功创业的底层心法：克服恐惧与利用工具

要像你那样成功地创办企业，大量启动副业并取得成功，需要什么样的显性底层心态？在探讨具体策略之前，是否需要某种基础心态、个性或性格特质？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is the overt sort of underpinning mentality that's required for someone to be successful at starting businesses in the way that you started them? Starting these side hustles at volume and seeing success. Is there like a foundational mentality or personality or character trait required before we get into the tactics?</p>
</details>

是的，我应该说，你所面临问题的痛苦必须大于你对别人看法的在意程度。它需要达到那个点，因为到目前为止，成功的最大障碍就是人们过于在意别人对他们的看法。所以他们不想做那件事，或者不想谈论做那件事，因为某个高中时的陌生人可能在Facebook上关注他们，并可能发表评论，对吧？这真的很傻，但我经历过，我理解。对吧？如果我们能克服这一点，如果我们能在大脑中切换开关，不再认为“人们在想我，人们在关心我”，而是直接关掉它。对吧？因为到那时，世界就是我们的囊中之物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, the I should say that the the pain of your problem needs to be greater than how much you care about what people think about you. It needs to get to that point because by far that is the biggest roadblock to success is people caring too much about what people think about them. And so they don't want to do the thing or they don't want to talk about doing the thing because some random person from high school follows them on Facebook and might comment something, right? Which is really silly, but I I've been there. I get it. Right? If we can get over that, if we can just flip the switch in our brain that says people are thinking about me, people are caring about me and just switch that to off. Right? Because the world is our oyster at that point.</p>
</details>

就我们目前所处的时代而言，科技、人工智能、高速互联网和手机，你认为这是人们开始做点什么、开始副业或尝试的最佳时机吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And in terms of where we sit at this moment of time with technology, with AI, with in fast internet, with mobile phones, do you think this is the best time for people to start something to to start a side hustle or to try?</p>
</details>

随着时间的推移，时机对人们来说越来越好，对吧？竞争越来越激烈，但工具也比以往任何时候都多。十年前，如果我想创业，即使互联网和社交媒体已经全面兴起，我可能也需要花很多钱，或者搬到旧金山，或者筹集**风险投资**（Venture Capital: 投资于初创企业或高成长性公司的资金）。我希望你能说服我。给我一个你必须筹集资金、必须全力以赴或必须辞职的想法。这样的想法不存在了。有了所有这些**人工智能**（AI: Artificial Intelligence: 模拟人类智能的机器或程序）工具、软件工具，你可以通过一个提示词创建一个网站，通过一个提示词创建一个应用程序。你可以在Facebook Marketplace上发布信息，一小时内就能收到数百条咨询。你可以投放Facebook广告。你可以去Craigslist。你可以在家门口立一块牌子。你可以向人们发起调查。有如此多的工具可以测试、验证和试验这些概念，以至于现在比以往任何时候都更容易接触到创业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Every day that goes by, the timing gets better for people, right? Things are getting more competitive, but there are more tools than ever. Um, 10 years ago, if I wanted to start a business, and this is like the internet's in full swing, social media is in full swing, I probably had to spend a lot of money or move to San Francisco or raise venture capital. That's like I I would love for you to try to convince me. Try to give me an idea where you have to raise money or where you have to go allin or where you you have to quit your job. It doesn't exist. With all these AI tools, software tools, you can make a website with one prompt. You can make an app with one prompt. You could post to Facebook Marketplace and have hundreds of inquiries within an hour. You could post Facebook ads. You could go to Craigslist. Like, you could put a sign up in front of your house. You could go launch a survey to people. Like, there are so many tools for testing and validating and experimenting with these concepts that it is more accessible than ever.</p>
</details>

为什么人们不这样做？我认为首要原因是他们害怕别人怎么看。其次是他们没有工具，或者至少没有将工具与想法联系起来，对吧？他们会用Facebook Marketplace卖沙发，但当他们验证自己的木工想法时，却不会想到使用它，对吧？他们只是没有将点连接起来。从某种意义上说，工具太多了，所以我们不知道如何将它们全部联系起来。他们可能也不知道**丰裕法则**（Law of Abundance: 认为资源和机会是无限的，而非有限的）是真实存在的，对吧？人们认为商业是**零和游戏**（Zero Sum Game: 指一方的收益必然是另一方的损失，总和为零）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why don't people? I think number one is they're afraid of what people think. Number two is they don't have the tools or at least they're not connecting the tools with the ideas, right? They'll use Facebook Marketplace to sell a sectional, but then they won't think to use it when validating their woodworking idea, right? They're just not connecting the dots. There's too many tools in a sense, so we don't know how to tie them all together. Um, they also probably don't know like how much the law of abundance is a real thing, right? People think business is a zero sum game.</p>
</details>

那是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What does that mean?</p>
</details>

嗯，他们认为市场已经饱和了。他们会有一个产品或服务的想法，然后会非常兴奋，然后他们会去Google搜索，然后会发现它已经存在了，然后他们就会放弃。而当我这样做，当我发现它已经存在时，我就会想：“太棒了，就是它！有人已经为我冲锋陷阵，验证了这一点。”然后我就会去**Web Archive**（Web Archive: 互联网档案，一个保存网站历史快照的数字图书馆），我会去**Whois**（Whois: 一个查询域名注册信息的服务），我会查看他们网站在过去十年间的样子。看看他们是如何开始的。也许他们的产品最初是99美元。现在每两个月收费49美元。有意思。好的。我会查看他们标题的文案。我会查看他们网站有多少个标签。他们是否发布了Instagram动态？我会查看所有这些东西，看看它是如何随着时间演变的，然后想：太棒了。我将从他今天所处的位置开始。这个人已经为我证明了它。他承担了所有的风险。这太棒了。它已经存在了。我不需要做得更好，我不需要做得不同。我只需要做同样的事情。而且市场足够大，世界足够大，我也能赢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, they think that things are oversaturated. They'll have an idea for a product or a service and then they'll get really excited and then they'll go Google it and then we'll see it exists and they'll move on. And when I do that and I see it exists, I'm like, "Yes, this is it. Someone someone went to the front lines of the battlefield and validated this for me." And then I'll go to the web archive. I'll go to who is and I'll go look at what their website has looked like over the last decade. See where they started. Maybe their product was $99. Now it's like 49 every 2 months. Interesting. Okay. I'll look at the the copy of their headline. I'll look at like how many tabs they have on their website. Do they post their Instagram feed on? I'll look at all these things and see how it's evolved over time and think awesome. I'm going to start where he's at today. like this guy already proved it out for me. He took all the risk. This is amazing. This exists. I don't need to like do it better. I don't need to do it differently. I just need to do the same thing. Um and the market is big enough, the world is big enough to where I can win as well.</p>
</details>

你提到了Web Archive。Web Archive扮演什么角色？对于不熟悉的人来说，那是什么？你如何使用它？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You said um web archive. What role does web archive play? What is that for anyone that isn't familiar? And how do you use that?</p>
</details>

是的，它只是一个工具，可以显示网站随时间变化的快照，对吧？所以，这是一种**逆向工程**（Reverse Engineering: 通过分析现有产品来推断其设计原理和制造过程）企业成功之道的好方法。然后还有另一个工具叫做**Similar Web**（Similar Web: 一个提供网站流量和用户行为分析数据的平台），你可以看到他们随时间变化的流量。你可以将两者叠加起来，然后说：“哦，有意思。当他们重新设计网站使其更适合移动设备时，他们的月流量从3000增加到4500。有意思。我从第一天起就把它设计成适合移动设备的。”对吧？所以，当我们开始时，我们有一个巨大的优势，就是从我们的竞争对手或未来的竞争对手已经达到的地方开始，而不是从我们认为需要开始的地方开始，比如试图与众不同、创新或独特。根据我的经验，那更多是我们的骄傲或**自我**（Ego: 心理学中指自我意识或自我形象）的信号。如果我们只是**复制粘贴**（Copy and Paste: 直接模仿或照搬）一个业务，即使我们自己有原创想法，我们也会觉得有点奇怪、古怪，甚至有点肮脏或不道德，而实际上没有什么可羞耻的。我们不想窃取他们的知识产权或他们的标志，但要复制已经奏效的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it's just a tool that shows snapshots uh over time of what a website looks like, right? So, it's a great way of kind of reverse engineering what businesses have done to be successful. And then there's another tool called Similar Web where you can see what their traffic has been over time. And you can kind of overlay the two and you can say, "Oh, interesting. When they when they redesigned their website to be more mobile friendly, their traffic went from 3,000 a month to 4500 a month. Interesting. I'm just going to make it mobile friendly from day one." Right? So we are at a great advantage when we start where our competitors or our future competitors already are instead of starting where we think we need to be starting like trying to be different or innovative or unique. In my experience, that's more of like a signal of our pride or our ego. We feel kind of like weird or odd or even dirty or unethical if we're just like copying and pasting a business. Even if we had the original idea ourselves when really there's nothing to be ashamed of. We don't want to steal their intellectual property or their logo or anything, but copy what's already working.</p>
</details>

人们认为，你知道，人们不认为那是可行的，因为他们认为如果我复制一个已经奏效的业务，那么我就不会得到任何客户，因为那个现有的业务已经拥有所有客户了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">People think, you know, people don't think that that's a thing because they think if I copy a business that's already working, then I'm not going to get any customers because that this existing business has all the customers.</p>

但这很有趣。我节目里有人谈到，世界上一些最伟大的企业家基本上只是复制了95%的蓝图。我想那是**沃尔玛**（Walmart: 美国大型连锁零售企业）。我想他当时在谈论沃尔玛，但是的，他们复制了其他区域性的连锁超市。嗯。复制作为一种策略。

<p class="english-text">But it's interesting. I had someone on the show where they talked about how some of the greatest entrepreneurs in the world basically just copy 95% of the blueprint. I think it was Walmart. I think he was talking about Walmart, but yeah, they copied other like regional grocery chains. Mhm. Copying as a strategy.</p>
</details>

是的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>

你做过吗？

<p class="english-text">Have you done that?</p>
</details>

哦，当然了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, absolutely.</p>
</details>

给我举个例子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Give me an example.</p>
</details>

好的。我在2010年上大学的时候，有一个手机维修业务。有一天我接到一个电话，有人说：“嘿，Chris，我想买你所有损坏的**iPhone**（iPhone: 苹果公司生产的智能手机）屏幕。”你有没有损坏的iPhone屏幕？当然。我们不会把它们扔掉，因为我们认为那对环境不好。我们只是有一个盒子装着它们。你会付我多少钱？3美元一个。为什么？你为什么要付我3美元？那只是碎玻璃。他们说：“嗯，实际上有一种方法可以**再制造**（Remanufacturing: 对旧产品进行拆解、修复和重新组装，使其恢复到新产品性能）这些屏幕。我们可以把它们寄到中国。我们可以移除碎玻璃，换上新玻璃，然后我们可以把它们作为再制造单元转售。”那就像一个灯泡突然亮了，对吧？所以，我想，大多数人此时会说：“是的，那我要把这些寄到哪里？”你知道，但我当时想：“哦，我需要进入那个行业。我想复制那个给我打电话的人。”现在。我不知道他的网站是什么。我不知道。我不知道他的公司叫什么名字。当时没有Web Archive可以查看。我只是想复制那个商业模式，因为我认为这会成为一件事。我在这个行业里。我了解这个行业。我也会这样做。第一年我们做了200万美元，然后是500万，然后是900万，几年后我们就退出了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Well, I I had a phone repair business in when I was in college, 2010, and I got a call one day from someone that said, "Hey, Chris, I want to buy all of your broken iPhone screens." Do you have any broken iPhone screens? Sure. We don't throw them away cuz we think it's bad for the environment. We just have a box of them. How much will you pay me? three bucks a piece. Why? Why? Why will you pay me $3? It's just broken glass. And they said, "Well, there's actually a way of remanufacturing these. We can send them to China. We can remove the broken glass, put new glass on them, and then we can resell them as a remanufactured unit." And that was just like a light bulb, right? So, most people, I think, at this point, would say, "Yeah, like, yeah, where do I ship these?" You know, but I was like, "Oh, I need to be in that business. I want to copy that guy who called me." right now. I don't know what his website was. I don't know. I don't know what the name of his business was. There was no web archive at the time to look at. I just wanted to copy the business model cuz I thought this is going to be a thing. I'm in the industry. I know the industry. I'm going to do this as well. We did 2 million the first year, then five, and then nine, and then we exited a few years after that.</p>
</details>

这很有趣，但你知道，你通常不会认为每个人都在寻找新想法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's interesting, but you know, you often don't think that everyone's in search of a new idea.</p>
</details>

嗯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mhm.</p>
</details>

而且很难找到新想法。是的，我想是爱因斯坦说过没有新想法这回事吗？听起来没错。但你有一种倾向，就是只看现有的模式并复制它们。你会不会在其中加入自己的特色？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's tough to find new ideas. Yeah, like I think was it Einstein that said there's no such thing as a new idea? Sounds right. But you have an orientation just to look at existing models and to replicate them. Do you put a spin on it at all?</p>
</details>

我会在时间推移中发展出自己的特色。对。因为我们都是环境的产物。所以在这个业务的案例中，我开始复制。完全正确。我去了**阿里巴巴**（Alibaba: 中国大型电商平台），我联系了大量销售iPhone屏幕的人，我说：“你们回收吗？你们回收吗？你们回收吗？”大约有5%到10%的人说“是”。然后我寄给他们样品，他们也寄回了一些给我。然后随着时间的推移，我开始运用一些营销原则，比如**Facebook广告**（Facebook Ads: 在Facebook平台投放的付费广告）、**电话营销**（Cold Calling: 未经事先联系而直接向潜在客户推销产品或服务），我开始应用它们，只是因为我不知道那个竞争对手是如何取得成功的。我知道他做电话营销，而且奏效了。我只知道这些。记住，我甚至不知道他公司的名字。所以随着时间的推移，你开始利用你以前的经验，对业务进行这些微调，使其成为你自己的。但如果你一开始就这样做，对吧？比如我接到一个电话，他说：“我想买你损坏的iPhone屏幕。”我说：“好的，我会做，但我不想只卖iPhone屏幕。那太逊了。我要做**三星**（Samsung: 韩国跨国电子公司）的。”对吧？很有可能根本没有那个市场，或者根本没有那个方法。而因为我的**自我**（Ego: 心理学中指自我意识或自我形象）、我的骄傲、我不愿意只是复制已经奏效的东西，我就不会拥有那个成功的业务。对吧？

<p class="english-text">I'll develop my own spins over time. Right. Because we're all a product of our environment. And so in in the case of this business, I started copying. Exactly. Right. Um I went and found people in China. I just went to Alibaba. I messaged a ton of people that sold iPhone screens and I said, "Do you recycle? Do you recycle? did you recycle? And like five or 10% of them said yes. So then I shipped them samples and then they shipped me some back and and then over time I started like taking some marketing principles principles from previous businesses like Facebook ads, cold calling and I started applying them just cuz I didn't know how this other competitor was finding success. I knew he was cold calling and that was working. That's all I knew. Remember I didn't even know the name of his business. And so over time, you start using your previous experiences to apply these tweaks to the business and to make it your own. But if you do that right at the outset, right? Like if I got a call and he said, "I want to buy your broken iPhone screens." And I said, "Okay, I'm going to do that, but I don't want to just sell iPhone screens. That's lame. I'm going to do Samsung." Right? Pretty good chance there's not even a market for that or there's not even a method for that. And because of my my ego, my pride, my unwillingness to just copy what's already working, I wouldn't that I wouldn't have that successful business in my back pocket. Right?</p>
</details>

所以，如果你一开始就做改变，那就像你的……我正在想一个类比，就像你正在进行一次长途公路旅行，你一开始就绕道而行，或者如果一架飞机正在飞行，它一开始就偏离航线一点点，它最终会偏离目的地数百英里。但如果它在途中进行调整，那么它就会更接近它原本会到达的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, if you do twists in the beginning, it's kind of like your um I'm kind of thinking of an analogy like if you're on a long road trip and you start taking detours early on or if a flight is on a flight path and he starts like getting off track just a little bit at the beginning, he's going to end off he's going to end up hundreds of miles away from his destination. But if he starts making tweaks along the way, then he'll be much closer to where he would have been anyway.</p>
</details>

嗯。你可能会通过一些调整达到更好的目的地，因为你将它与你的经验，你比你复制的人更了解的东西融合在一起。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mhm. And you might reach a better destination with some of those tweaks because you're blending it with your your experience, what you know better than the person that you're copying.</p>
</details>

所以，一开始完全复制这个模式很重要，因为你也会了解到这个现有模式中哪些地方是有效的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so it's important to to copy the model exactly at the beginning because you're also going to learn what it is about that existing model that works.</p>

是的。

因此，你可以进行迭代、改变、扩展。如果你不这样做，你可能会错过一些东西。

完全正确。因为我经常犯这样的错误，看着别人的生意说：“哦，天哪，他们为什么要那样做？他们为什么要那样收费？他们为什么要收取所有这些不同的费用？那太令人困惑了。”我犯了这个错误。我曾经有一个**电子商务履约业务**（E-commerce Fulfillment Business: 为电商卖家提供仓储、拣货、包装和发货等服务的业务），品牌会把他们的所有产品寄给我们。我们有一个大仓库，我们会把他们的所有东西都发出去，对吧？我当时想：“他们为什么要收取仓储费、拣货包装费和运费？他们还收取追踪保质期的费用。如果一个盒子里有五件商品而不是四件，他们还会收取额外费用。那里有太多的摩擦。那太混乱了。我们要把它简化。我们只收一笔固定费用，不收仓储费，这将是我们的**差异化因素**（Differentiator: 使产品或服务在市场上与众不同的特点），对吧？”然后随着时间的推移，在几个月甚至几年的时间里，我们了解到，哦，仓储费。那是因为有时你的客户会倒闭，然后你就得承担费用，而且你的仓储成本实际上非常高，但却没有办法转嫁。哦，拣货包装费是因为你学到了所有这些东西，然后你就会想：“好吧，我不是那个拥有**MBA**（MBA: 工商管理硕士）学位的天才。我只是想加入自己的特色，因为我以为我比那个企业主更聪明。”结果，一个做了15年的人比一个做了15天的人更了解这个行业。我最好还是复制他的定价，复制他网站的布局，复制他仓库的大小，复制他所追求的**利基市场**（Niche Market: 指特定、小众且需求独特的市场），因为那显然对他有效。所以，我不再犯那个错误了。我不再认为其他竞争对手是白痴，对吧？是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Exactly. Cuz so often I made the mistake of looking at another business and saying, "Oh man, why are they doing that? Why are they charging like that? Why? Like they're charging all these different things. That's so confusing." I made this mistake. I had a an e-commerce fulfillment business where brands would send us all their products. We had this big warehouse and we would ship all all of their stuff out, right? And I was like, "Why do they have storage fees, pick pack, and ship fees? They they charge fees for tracking their expiration dates. They charge extra fees if there's five items in a box versus four. Like there's so much friction there. That's so messy. Like we're going to make this simple. We're going to just one flat fee, no storage fee, and that's going to be our differentiator, right? And then over time, over the course of months and years, we learned, oh, storage fees. It's because sometimes your customers go out of business and then you're left holding the bill and like your storage costs are actually very high but there's nothing to pass on. Oh, pick back and ship fees because you learn all these things and you're like, "Okay, I wasn't like this genius that had an MBA. I was just like trying to put my own spin on it cuz I thought I was smarter than that business owner." Turns out someone that's been doing this for 15 years versus 15 days knows a lot more about the industry than me. And I'm much better off just copying his pricing, copying the layout of his website, copying the size of the warehouse he has, copying the same niche that he's going after, cuz that's clearly working for him. So, I don't make that mistake anymore. I don't I don't assume that other competitors are idiots, right? Yeah.</p>

我被证明错了太多次了。

我过去几天有几位高管在我家，我们正在研究不同的模式，基本上我们正在研究其他与我们做类似事情且存在已久的公司。我当时问了一个问题，我突然有了同样的顿悟。我当时想，他们为什么要那样做？那不是很糟糕吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I had um several of our executives over at my house over the last couple of days and we were looking at different models of so basically we're looking at other companies that do similar things to us that have been around for a long time. And the question that I ended up asking at one moment when I was had the exact same epiphany. I was like why do they do it that way? Isn't that shitty?</p>
</details>

有一瞬间，我想我们都想尝试**重新发明轮子**（Reinvent the Wheel: 指做一些已经有很好解决方案的事情，浪费时间和精力）。但现在，凭借多年的商业智慧，我问自己的问题是：它为什么会变成那样？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there was a second where I think we were tempted to try and reinvent the wheel. But the question I ask myself now with the wisdom of like many years of business is like why did it end up that way?</p>
</details>

也就是说，我们做了50年的竞争对手为什么会走到那一步？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Which is why did our competitor who's been doing this for 50 years end up there?</p>
</details>

因为正如你所说，显然发生了一系列事情，让他们得出结论，无论是规模还是其他因素，都让他们得出结论，这是最好的做法。就像你一样，我错了太多次了，我曾以为他们只是白痴。这就是为什么他们看不到这个显而易见的事情。但实际上，他们的模式在市场中经受的压力测试比我的多得多。所以也许我应该……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because that as you said there's clearly a set of things that have happened that have made them conclude whether it's at scale or some other factor that's made them conclude that this is the best way of doing it. And just like you I've been wrong so many times where I've thought they're just idiots. That's why they they they can't see this obvious thing. But actually their model is stress tested in the market much more than mine is. So maybe I should</p>
</details>

我应该放下我的**自我**（Ego: 心理学中指自我意识或自我形象），至少像他们一样开始，正如你所说，我认为这是非常重要的建议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I should put my ego aside and at least start how they start as you said which I think is really important advice.</p>
</details>

是的。嗯，有时候一家公司只是因为某个方法有效而持续做下去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Well, there are times when a company just keeps doing something because it works.</p>
</details>

是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

所以他们没有花时间去测试更好的方法，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so they don't take the time to test something that works better, right?</p>
</details>

但几乎不可能猜测那是什么，对吧？比如，如果一个服装品牌完全通过Facebook广告发展业务，而他们从未尝试过**Google广告**（Google Ads: 谷歌提供的在线广告平台），也许Google广告的转化率会高出一倍。高出一倍，对吧？但我不想去猜测。我只想从Facebook广告开始，然后我仍然会拿出5%的预算开始测试其他概念。但十有八九，我最终还是会回到Facebook广告。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it's almost impossible to guess what that is, right? Like if a if a clothing brand is growing their business entirely through Facebook ads um and they've just never tried Google ads, maybe Google ads could convert twice as better. Twice twice better, right? But I don't want to guess that. I just want to start with Facebook ads and then I'll still take 5% of my budget and start testing other concepts. But nine times out of 10, I ended up just coming right back to Facebook ads.</p>
</details>

这让我想到，在商业中，基本上所有事情（再次强调，这里是广义而言）都可以分为两类：一类是**老问题**（Old Problems: 指那些已经存在很久，有成熟解决方案和思维模式的问题），成千上万的人在你之前就已经遇到过，同样的解决方案和思维方式仍然适用；另一类是**新问题**（New Problems: 指那些由新技术（如AI）创造的，没有现成蓝图和解决方案的新挑战），比如人工智能创造了一系列新问题和新机遇。我倾向于发现，商业中95%的事情都是老问题，比如招聘、现金流、财务处理、法律事务等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It got me thinking about how in business basically everything, again speaking broadly here, can be put into one of two categories. either like old problems where thousands of people have come before you and the same solutions and same thinking is still relevant and then new problems you know things like AI have created a set of new problems new opportunities as well and what I tend to find is that like 95% of the things in business are like old problems like hiring cash flow how finance is done legal all those kinds of things</p>
</details>

当你在处理一个老问题时，专业知识通常就是答案，比如找到一个懂行的人，雇佣一个导师或其他什么。然后你就会遇到这些新问题，在我们的行业中没有蓝图。这是一个全新的挑战。所以**实验**（Experimentation: 通过尝试和测试来发现解决方案或验证假设）就是答案。这在你的脑海中大致成立吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and the and when when you're dealing with a new an old problem expertise is usually the answer which is like find someone who knows hire someone or mentor or whatever and then you have these new problems where there is no blueprint in our industry. It's a new new challenge. So experimentation is the answer. Does that like broadly hold in your in your mind?</p>
</details>

哦，百分之百。是的。我喜欢说，除了毒品，什么都测试。我们一直在测试。这是我们所做一切的基础。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Oh 100%. Yeah. I I like to say test everything except drugs. Like we're always testing. Um it's the basis to everything we do.</p>
</details>

但当这是一个老问题时，你还会测试吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But do you test when it's an old problem?</p>
</details>

你能给我举个例子吗？比如现金流管理，关于试用期和通知期的招聘原则，很多法律结构和交易，以及那些有成熟先例的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can you give me an example? So like things like cash flow management um hiring principles around like probation and uh notice periods um a lot of legal structuring and deals things with like a wellestablished president</p>
</details>

成熟的先例，世界上没有什么根本性的变化使之失效。是的，我认为如果是一个老问题，我会寻找过去十年中有人以有趣的方式解决了它的例子，我更倾向于复制它。比如在招聘方面，传统上公司会花费数小时、数周或数天进行招聘，一轮又一轮地面试。如果你看看**Y Combinator**（Y Combinator: 著名的美国创业加速器），可以说是世界上最伟大的创业孵化器，他们有七分钟的面试。他们说他们会把它缩短到五分钟，但这感觉很不礼貌，对吧？在他们的面试中，他们在前三分钟就知道是否合适，然后面试就结束了。他们要么被录用，要么不被录用。我以同样的方式对待招聘。我宁愿采用**大数法则**（Law of Large Numbers: 概率论中的一个定理，指在大量重复试验中，事件发生的频率会接近其理论概率）的方法，给五个人30天的时间来展示他们的技能，而不是花30天全力以赴地投入到一个人身上。因为根据我的经验，我花了30天的那个人，并不比我可能测试的另外五个人更有可能成功。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well established presidents where like nothing has fundamentally changed in the world that makes that invalid. Yeah, I think if it's an old problem, I look to an example of someone within the last decade that's solved it in an interesting way and I'm more likely to copy that. Like in hiring, traditionally companies will they'll spend hours and weeks or days hiring, going from round to round to round, person. And if you look at Y Combinator, arguably the greatest, you know, startup incubator in the world, they have seven-minute interviews. Um, and they said they would make it five minutes, but it just felt rude, right? and in their interviews, they really know in the first three minutes if it's a fit or not, and then the interview's done. Like, they're either in or they're not. I I approach hiring the same way. Um, I would much rather um take a like a a law of large numbers approach to it and give five people 30 days to show what their skills are as opposed to spending 30 days going all in on one person. Because in my experience, that one person that I spent 30 days on is not any more likely to succeed than those those other five people that I might be testing.</p>

### Buc-ee's案例：发现未被满足的市场需求

你的一个让你走红的视频，我想是关于**Buc-ee's**（Buc-ee's: 美国德克萨斯州一家以大型便利店和加油站闻名的连锁品牌）的故事。我们世界上可能不知道Buc-ee's是什么。我想它是一个美国品牌。

但这显示了你总是倾向于以稍微不同或创新的方式思考。

<details>

<p class="english-text">But this shows I think how you've always had an orientation to think slightly differently or in innovatively.</p>
</details>

是的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

Buc-ee's发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What happened with BIES?</p>
</details>

当时我正在经营那家为其他公司运送产品的电子商务履约业务。Buc-ee's是一个加油站品牌，只有50个门店。而这50个门店却创造了数十亿美元的收入。我说它是加油站，但它们的面积在4万到8万平方英尺之间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So this was during the time when I was running that business shipping products for other companies. Right. Bies is a gas station brand uh with only 50 locations. And from those 50 locations, they do billions of dollars of revenue. I say gas station, they're between 40,000 and 80,000 square feet.</p>
</details>

哇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow.</p>
</details>

它们非常庞大。它们拥有一个令人惊叹的品牌，一个令人惊叹的标志，并且深受客户信任。但这些加油站位于前往公路旅行目的地的途中，它们地处偏远。所以，如果你住在达拉斯，开车去海滩，你会在去程和回程中停靠Buc-ee's，你可能会花数百美元，对吧？你会加满油，然后买衬衫、零食和所有这些东西。所以，当时我们正在经营电子商务履约业务，我们去了Buc-ee's。我带上我的表弟，我的商业伙伴，只是为了让他体验一下。我们当时正在聊天。我清楚地记得我在哪里。我当时在DFW的一个巨大的地下通道下面，我们正开车回家，我说：“伙计，这些家伙在线上肯定赚翻了。他们肯定卖了很多东西。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They're massive. They have an amazing brand, an amazing logo, and they just have a lot of trust from their customers. But these gas stations are like they're on the way out to these road trip destinations. They're out in the middle of nowhere. And so if you're if you live in Dallas and you're driving down to the beach, you're going to stop by Bies on the way there and on the way back, and you're probably going to spend hundreds of dollars, right? You're going to fill up the tank, then you're going to buy shirts and snacks and all that stuff. So, at the time we were running this e-commerce fulfillment business, we went to Buckies. I brought my cousin, my business partner, um, just to kind of show him the experience. And we were just having a conversation. I remember exactly where I was. I was like under this underpass, this huge under pass in DFW. We were driving home and I said, "Man, these guys must kill it online. They must sell so much stuff." Um,</p>

因为我知道**迪士尼**（Disney: 美国大型娱乐公司）在他们的网站上销售了数十亿美元的T恤，对吧？我最近读到一项统计数据。所以，我只是把那个数据点和Buc-ee's联系起来，然后说：“好吧，Buc-ee's的规模只是迪士尼的一小部分，但他们拥有同样多的品牌忠诚度。人们喜欢他们的衬衫。你会看到他们的衬衫遍布世界各地，即使他们只有50个门店，而且都位于美国东南部，对吧？”所以我们去了他们的网站，没有购物按钮。没有地方可以买他们的东西，我当时就像所有灯泡都同时亮了，对吧？我当时想：“哦，天哪，好吧，我们需要联系他们。我们需要让他们上线。”我当时有很多想法，我的表弟比我平衡得多。他就像是**运营者**（Operator: 负责日常运营和执行的人），而我就是那个**多动症**（ADHD: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: 注意力缺陷多动障碍）的疯子，对吧？所以他的职责是让我冷静下来，他在这方面做得很好。但我就是无法冷静下来。我当时想：“不，不，不。我们必须在这里做点什么。我们要把所有东西都买一份。我们要雇一个摄影师给它们拍照。我们要推出我们自己的Buc-ee's在线商店，我们要努力让它**病毒式传播**（Go Viral: 指内容在互联网上迅速传播，获得大量关注）。”就像，要么病毒式传播，要么失败，对吧？如果我们不病毒式传播，那么我接下来的三年就只能吃这些不健康的零食了。所以，我们照做了。我们买了一切。花了数千美元。我带上了我的四个孩子。我们把它带回我们的仓库。我们给它拍了照片。我们启动了一个网站。我给所有能找到的记者发了邮件。其中一位记者非常喜欢这个想法。他采纳了它。所以他联系了Buc-ee's征求意见，因为他们不回复我的**冷邮件**（Cold Email: 指向不认识或没有事先联系过的人发送的邮件）。我想和他们一起推出这个项目，但我是谁？他们不在乎我。我也不怪他们。所以他写了一篇关于我的长篇报道。数百万人阅读了它。所有其他新闻媒体也报道了它。我们在前30天内通过这种方式自然地赚取了数十万美元。

<p class="english-text">Because I knew that Disney sells like billions of dollars of t-shirts on their website, right? I read a stat recently. So, I kind of just took that data point, connected it to Bies, and said, "All right, Bies is a fraction of the size of Disney, but they have the same amount of brand loyalty. People love their shirts. You'll see their shirts all over the world, even though they only have 50 locations like in the Southeast, right?" And so we went to their website and there was no shop button. There was no place to buy their stuff and I was just like like all the light bulbs were going off at once, right? It was like, "Oh my gosh, okay, we need to reach out to them. Like we need to bring them online." I just had all these ideas and my cousin is is much more balanced than I am. He's like the the operator and I'm like the ADHD crazy guy, right? So his role is to like calm me down and he's very good at that. But I just couldn't be calmed down from this. I'm like, "No, no, no. We got to do something here. We're going to buy one of everything. We're going to hire a photographer to take pictures of it. We're going to launch our own BIES online store, and we're going to try to go viral." Like, it's viral or bust, right? If we don't go viral, then I'll just be eating these unhealthy snacks for the next 3 years of my life. And so, we did. We bought one of everything. Uh, it cost thousands of dollars. I brought all four of my kids. And, uh, we brought it back to our warehouse. We took pictures of it. We launched a website. Um, and I emailed all the reporters I could find. Uh, and one of them just loved the idea. He ran with it. And so he reached out to BIES for comment cuz they wouldn't respond to my cold emails. I wanted to launch this like with them in tandem, but who am I? They didn't care about me. And I don't blame them. And so he wrote this big article about me. Millions of people read it. All these other news outlets uh wrote about it. And we did hundreds of thousands of of dollars in our first 30 days organically from that.</p>
</details>

Buc-ee's对此有何看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How did Bies feel about that?</p>
</details>

他们希望我们对网站进行一些关键修改。他们希望我们基本上在所有地方都加上免责声明，说明我们不是Buc-ee's，我们与Buc-ee's无关。他们希望我们更改名称。名称中包含“beaver”（海狸）这个词，那是他们的吉祥物。他们只是不希望有任何混淆。所以，我们做了所有这些修改，然后得到了他们的非官方认可。他们说：“我们不会签署任何东西，但你们得到了我们的祝福。玩得开心。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They wanted us to make some key changes to the website. They wanted us to like basically put disclaimers everywhere that said we are not Bies. We're not affiliated with Bies. They wanted us to change the name. It had the word beaver in the name. That's their mascot. They just they didn't want it to be confusing at all. So, we made all those changes and then we got like the unofficial thumbs up from them. They said, "We're not going to sign anything, but like you have our blessing. Um, have fun."</p>
</details>

那个网站让你赚了很多钱吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And did that website make you a lot of money?</p>
</details>

是的，现在还在赚钱。已经五年了。我们仍然拥有它100%的股份，而且经营得非常好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it still is. It's been 5 years. We still own it, 100% of it, and it's going great.</p>

嗯哼。

<p class="english-text">Uh-huh.</p>
</details>

听众能从中吸取什么教训，并将其应用到自己的生活中，在世界上寻找类似的机会，还是说这只是一个**一次性**（One-and-Done: 指只发生一次，不可复制或重复）的机会？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What can someone listening take from that in terms of applying that to their own life, finding opportunities like that out in the world, or is that just a oneandone? Is there only one opportunity like that?</p>
</details>

好的。所以，具体来说，我经常被问到这个问题。别人如何用另一个品牌做到这一点？我不知道。如果还有另一个这样的品牌，我就会去做，对吧？**Trader Joe's**（Trader Joe's: 美国一家连锁超市）类似，但他们非常注重法律。我认为那次特殊的实验，即为一个实体企业推出在线品牌，有点像**昙花一现**（Lightning in a Bottle: 指非常罕见或难以复制的成功）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So, specific, I get asked that question a lot. How could someone do that with another brand? I don't know. If if there was another brand out there like that, I would be doing it, right? Trader Joe's is similar, but they're very ligious. Um I think that was kind of lightning in a bottle for that particular experiment as in launching an online brand for an in-person business.</p>
</details>

好的。但人们听到这些不应该气馁，因为从宏观层面来看，人们应该非常认真地对待他们好奇的想法。他们需要缩短从产生想法到付诸行动之间的时间，因为那会增强他们**行动偏好**（Bias for Action: 指倾向于快速采取行动而非过度分析或拖延的心理倾向）的“肌肉”，对吧？我们每天都会有想法，有些好，有些坏。我们通常不会付诸行动，它只是一闪而过的念头，对吧？无论是商业想法，还是我需要与某人进行一次艰难的对话，任何想法，对吧？但是，我们越是缩短从产生想法到付诸行动之间的时间，我们就会越频繁地这样做。它会变成一个**自我延续的雪球**（Self-Perpetuating Snowball: 指一个过程或现象不断自我强化并扩大影响），不断累积。然后不知不觉中，我们就会有更多的想法。我们会对这些想法采取更多的行动。我们会测试事物。我们会学习工具。我们会实验。我们就会拥有一整套业务组合。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. But people should not be disheartened hearing that because on a macro level like people should take their curious ideas very seriously. They need to shorten the amount of time spent between having the idea and doing something about that idea because that will strengthen their bias for action muscle, right? We all have ideas, some of them good, some of them bad on a regular basis. We usually don't do anything about it. It's just a passing thought, right? Whether it's a business idea or a hard conversation I need to have with something, any idea, right? But the the the more we shrink the amount of time between doing something about that idea and having the idea that that idea, the more often we'll do that. And it becomes this self-perpetuating snowball that just compounds. And then before we know it, we'll get more ideas. We'll do more about those ideas. We'll be testing things. We'll be learning tools. We'll be experimenting. And we'll have a whole portfolio of businesses.</p>
</details>

但你的心态或视角中是否有某种特质，让你走进Buc-ee's时，甚至会思考如何做点什么，而大多数人走进Buc-ee's只是买东西然后离开？你的世界观中是否有某种基础性的东西？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is there something in your mentality or perspective though where you walk into a Buckies and you even think about how you could do something whereas most people walk into a Bies and buy their stuff and leave? Like is there something foundational in the way that you're looking at the world?</p>
</details>

是的。但我认为我没有什么不同。我认为很多人都有这样的想法。比如你走进Buc-ee's，你看到一些可以改进的地方，人们会有这些一闪而过的念头，然后就过去了。我认为你会成为一个善于将这些想法付诸行动的专家。当你将这些想法付诸行动时，你就会在你的工作、你的测试中变得更好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. But I don't think I'm any different. I think um I think a lot of people have ideas like that. Like you walk into a BIES and you see something about something that could be improved and people have these passing thoughts and they move on. I think that you become an expert at doing something about those ideas. When you do something about those ideas, you just you get better at at what you do, at what you test,</p>
</details>

因为你已经锻炼出某种“肌肉”，这意味着你似乎不像普通人那样在意失败。而且在那种特殊情况下，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">cuz you've built up some kind of muscle, which means that you don't really care about it seems failure as much as the average person. And also in that particular case,</p>

普通人可能会想，我在这方面没有经验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the average person might think, well, I've got no experience in doing that.</p>
</details>

嗯。不，没有人有任何经验，直到他们去做，对吧？就像每个专家都是从新手开始的，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mhm. No, no one has any experience in anything until they do it, right? Like every every expert started out as a beginner, right?</p>
</details>

然而，有时人们尝试后发现这并不能给他们带来能量。这不适合他们。没关系。现在，当他们有想法时，他们就会知道，好吧，这个想法已经验证过了。这不适合我。创业这件事，需要别人来做。太棒了，祝他们一切顺利。我只是希望人们能为自己回答这个问题。我讨厌看到人们脸上流露出遗憾。比如我有些朋友想创业，他们总是谈论这件事，我知道他们会做得很好，我知道这让他们很痛苦，他们客观上有很多很好的想法，我只是讨厌看到他们余生都带着这个问题。我只是想让他们尝尝创业的滋味。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sometimes though, people try this and they learn h doesn't give them energy. It's not for them. That's okay. Now, when they have ideas, they can know, all right, box checked. That's not really for me. That entrepreneurship thinks someone else needs to do that. And great, good. All the power to them. I just want people to answer that question for themselves. I hate seeing regret in people's faces. Like I have friends that want to start a business. They've always talked about it and I know they would be good at it and I know it just eats them up and they have really really good ideas objectively and I I just hate seeing them have that question for the rest of their lives. I just want them to to taste entrepreneurship.</p>
</details>

但创业适合所有人吗？你知道，你可以想想你所有的朋友。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is it for everybody though? You know, you can think think of all your friends.</p>
</details>

是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

你可能会把他们分成几组：这个人应该创业，这个人不应该创业。嗯。那么，是什么决定了谁属于哪一组呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can probably put them in groups of this person should, this person shouldn't. Mhm. And what defines who goes in which group?</p>
</details>

对我来说，这取决于他们为那个想法付诸行动的程度。因为我会有一些朋友给我发短信分享想法，或者和我谈论想法，然后我就再也听不到他们谈论那件事了。我不会担心他们。对吧？我觉得这里存在一种**选择偏差**（Selection Bias: 指在抽样或选择数据时，样本未能代表总体，导致结果出现偏差）。如果他们真的想做点什么，他们会更进一步。他们会跟我进。那是，嘿，我做了这件事。因为我总是会给他们建议和反馈。你应该这样做。你应该尝试这个。然后他们会跟进。然后，你知道，在某个时候，它就会消亡，对吧？但如果他们只是告诉我他们的想法，而没有更进一步，那么我就不会为他们失眠。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">To me, it's how far they go in doing something about that idea because I will have friends that will text me ideas or talk to me about ideas and then I never hear from them again about that thing. I don't worry about them. Right? I I feel like there's a selection bias at play. Like if they really wanted to do something about it, they would get a little further down the line. They'd follow up with me. that's, hey, I did this thing. Cuz I'll always give them tips and feedback. You should do this. You should try this. And they'll follow up. And then, you know, at some point along the line, it'll die, right? But if they don't get any further than just telling me their idea, then I don't I don't lose sleep over them.</p>
</details>

所以，这有点像**适者生存**（Survival of the Fittest: 达尔文进化论中的概念，指最能适应环境的个体才能生存下来），它本身就是一种自我选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it's kind of surviv. It's kind of sort of self- selecting itself anyway.</p>
</details>

这就是创业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is entrepreneurship.</p>
</details>

是的。当然。但我的其他朋友会一直跟进，一直跟进，然后它就消亡了，这没关系。我的很多想法也消亡了。对我来说，那是一个信号，表明它注定要消亡，对吧？我就会转向下一件事。所以，也许我只是有偏见，他们看起来更像我，你知道吗？也许那不是一个准确的信号，但如果他们看起来更像我，那么这就是一个信号，表明他们应该更进一步，真正启动一些能产生收入的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Absolutely. But then I have other friends that are like they'll follow up, they'll follow up, they'll follow up, and then and then it dies, which is okay. A lot of my ideas die, too. And to me, that's a signal that it was supposed to die, right? I'll just move on to the next thing. Um, so it's those people that maybe I'm just biased and they look more like me, you know? Um, maybe that's not an accurate signal or not, but if they look more like me, then that's a signal that they they should get further down the line and actually launch something that gets to revenue. Yeah.</p>

你为什么会想到那个人，而不是告诉我他是谁？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why did you think of that person without telling me who they are?</p>
</details>

因为他们在工作中赚了很多钱，而且他们足够喜欢自己的工作。他们不痛苦。他们40多岁了，他们可能觉得创业风险太大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because they make a lot of money at their job and they like their job well enough. They're not miserable. Um, and they're in their late 40s and they probably feel like it would be too big of a risk to start something.</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you're looking at that on a risk-reward basis thinking the reward doesn't out outweigh the risk here for you?</p>
</details>

是的，是的。因为人们来找我，希望我能鼓励他们辞职，对吧？就像恳求我这样做，但实际上并没有恳求我。我不想那样做。我从来没有辞过职。我是从创业开始的，对吧？所以，想到一个48岁、有四个孩子的人，辞掉年薪40万美元的工作去测试一些东西。这对我来说简直是疯了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. Cuz people come to me like hoping that I'll encourage them to quit their job, right? Like begging me to do that without actually begging me. And I don't want to do that. Like I I've never had to quit a job. Like I I started with entrepreneurship, right? So the thought of being 48 with four kids and quitting my $400,000 a year job to test something. It just sounds crazy to me.</p>
</details>

另一方面，想想你认识的一个不是企业家，但绝对应该成为企业家的人，你总是想：“他们为什么不做呢？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On the other hand, think of one person you know that isn't an entrepreneur, but definitely should be, but you always think, "Why don't they do it?"</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Why did you think of that person?</p>
</details>

因为他是一个最常向我提出想法的人，而且他的想法真的非常好。他是一名工程师。所以他以那种方式看待世界。工程师是优秀的企业家。而且他有很强的职业道德，他正处于职业中期，但还没有走得很远。我客观上知道他并不……他实际上对自己的工作相当不满。我为他感到难过，因为我看到了他的才能。我希望他能**脱颖而出**（Excel: 在某方面表现出色），我希望看到他的梦想实现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because it's a person that comes to me the most often with ideas and they're really, really good ideas. He's an engineer. Um, and so he sees the world in that way. Engineers make great entrepreneurs. Um, and he has a great work ethic and he's like mid-career but not not so far along. And I know objectively that he's not he's actually quite miserable in his job. And I hate that for him because I see the talent that's there. And I want him like I think he would excel and I want to see that dream come true for him.</p>

他为什么不做呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>

是的。恐惧，可能是害怕放弃一些确定的东西，这些东西为他的家庭提供了美好的生活方式，并且永远无法再找回来。我认为不安全感是我们最好和最坏的自我的根源，它可能驱使我们成为最好或最坏的自我，这取决于我们对这些不安全感的**自我意识**（Self-Aware: 指对自己思想、感受和行为的认识和理解）程度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. fear of probably fear of just letting go of something certain that's provided his family a nice lifestyle and not getting that back again ever. Um I think that insecurities are at the root of our best and our worst selves and it can drive us to be our best or worst selves um depending on how self-aware we are about those insecurities.</p>
</details>

从你的角度来看，他的思维方式是否存在一点缺陷？比如，为什么你仍然认为他应该创业，即使他所说的关于家庭安全感的事情是真的？这表明你认为他的思维方式存在某种缺陷。

因为他不必辞职。一天中有足够的时间在晚上和周末做这些事情，足以证明其价值。很多时候，我们的副业，如果我们只在下班后做，它的**上限**（Ceiling: 指能达到的最高水平或限制）非常低，对吧？假设我们每周花20小时做副业，每年赚5万美元，但我们的工作每年支付20万美元，我们每周花40小时在工作上。我注意到一件事，这与我辞职的感受有些矛盾，那就是当我们把每年5万美元的副业从每周20小时增加到每周40小时，并辞掉全职工作时，那5万美元的年收入会变成50万美元，对吧？我们把工作时间增加了一倍，但收入却增加了十倍，因为我们**破釜沉舟**（Burn the Boats: 指切断所有退路，全力以赴追求成功）了，它必须成功。我只是不希望人们过早地破釜沉舟，对吧？比如，必须有一条途径。假设我们的Facebook广告转化率很高。我们已经测试了扩展它，而且它们是有利可图的，我们知道那会是什么样子。但如果我们扩展它，我们就会有更多的客户服务投诉。我们必须做更多的网站架构。但我们看到了扩展的途径，而且它已经盈利了，我们知道我的老板可能会重新雇用我，我们有这些**安全网**（Safety Net: 指在遇到困难时提供支持和保护的措施）。那才是真正破釜沉舟的最佳时机。而不是当我们有一个想法，或者我们已经测试了一点点但不够彻底的时候。在我看来，那太早了。

<p class="english-text">Because he doesn't have to quit his job. um there's enough time in the day to do this on the nights and weekends to to do enough of it to really prove itself out. Often times like whatever our side hustle is, uh it has a very low ceiling if we're only working on it um after hours, right? Let's say we're spending 20 hours a week on a side hustle and it makes us $50,000 a year, but our job pays us $200,000 a year and we spend 40 hours a week on that. One thing that I've noticed, which is kind of contradictory to how I feel about quitting something, um, is when we go from 20 hours a week on our the $50,000 a year side hustle to 40 hours a week and we quit the full-time thing, that $50,000 a year goes to 500,000, right? We double the amount of hours, but we 10 times the amount of money that comes from it because of the fact that we burn the boats that it has to work. I just I don't want people to burn the boats too soon, right? Like there has to be a pathway. Like let's say our Facebook ads are converting really well. We've tested scaling it and they're profitable and we know what that would look like. But if we scale it, then we're going to have more customer service complaints. We're going to have to do more architecture of the website. But we like we see a path to scaling and it's already profitable and we know that like probably my boss will take me back like we have kind of these uh safety nets. That's like the perfect time to really burn the boats. Not when like we have an idea or we've tested it a little bit but not thoroughly. Um that's too soon in my opinion.</p>

我可以百分之百地自相矛盾。好吧。所以，理性的Chris，有四个孩子的Chris会说，绝对应该有，你必须是一个父亲，你必须是一个丈夫，你必须为你的家庭提供保障，对吧？而且，再次强调，有如此多的工具可以用于测试、扩展和外包。我们可以找一个商业伙伴来分担工作。我们可以利用我们的孩子，我们可以利用我们的配偶，等等。在辞职之前，有如此多的方法可以真正验证一些事情，我们不必辞职。

但另一方面，在我的创业生涯中，有两次有人替我破釜沉舟了，对吧？我登陆一个岛屿，我有一个B计划。我正在测试这个业务。这个业务是盈利的，它能支付账单。然后半夜里，有人偷偷溜出去。他们烧了我的船，我醒来后想，哇，我的B计划呢？我还没准备好破釜沉舟呢。然后A计划就**蓬勃发展**（Thrives: 繁荣发展，兴旺）。对吧？这并不是因为我不再有安全网，而是因为那件事给了我一种**不服输的精神**（Chip on My Shoulder: 指因为过去的不公或挑战而产生的强烈决心和动力），让我想要证明那些坏人是错的。对。简单来说，就是那些烧我船的人。

<p class="english-text">Exactly. That's a that's a good way to put it to show them I didn't need those boats. I'm not going back, right? This island is better than where I came from.</p>

我记得读过一项关于B计划的研究，他们找了两组学生，然后让他们完成一个拼图来赢得奖励。其中一组学生被告知，如果他们愿意，可以在走廊尽头的自动售货机上获得同样的奖励。而那些不明白他们可以通过B计划获得相同奖励的那组学生，在完成拼图时付出了更多的努力。

<p class="english-text">I remember reading about a study on Plan B's where they got a group of students, two groups, and then they told them to do a puzzle to win a treat. And then in one of the groups, they told them that they could get this treat at a vending machine down the hallway if they if they wanted it after. And the group that didn't understand they could get the same reward from a plan B worked significantly harder to complete that puzzle.</p>
</details>

所以，人类心理中有一种东西，当你知道你可以通过另一种方式获得奖励时，当你有一个B计划时，我们就会在A计划上付出更少的努力。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So there's something in the human psyche of know when you know that you could get the reward in another way. When you have a plan B, we work less hard at the plan A.</p>
</details>

从逻辑上讲，也许我们应该，你知道，实际且不负责任地从我们的头脑中移除B计划。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Logically, maybe we should, you know, practical and unresponsible remove the plan B from our mind.</p>
</details>

是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

是的，是的，我就是这样，我想不出我身边有任何人的故事，他们测试了一些东西，放弃了A计划，然后B计划失败了，然后他们就失去了一切。当然，这种情况肯定发生过，对吧？当人们过早放弃时，确实会发生这种情况，但根据我的经验，它就是不会发生。它会产生相反的效果。它会成为一个巨大的激励因素。当他们辞职时，我问他们：“你感觉怎么样？你是不是吓坏了？”他们总是说：“我现在太兴奋了。我要全力以赴。这必须成功。”它确实成功了。

<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah, I just like I I can't think of any stories from people in my sphere of influence that have tested something, quit the plan A, and then plan B just failed and like they just lost everything. Like surely that's happened, right? That does happen when people like prematurely quit, but in my experience, it just it doesn't happen. Like it it has the opposite effect. It becomes this huge motivating factor. And when they quit, I ask them like, "How do you feel? Are you freaking out?" And it's always always, "I'm so excited right now. Like, I'm going to go all in on this. Like, this has to work." And it does. It just does.</p>

### 被动收入的真相：从“汗水收入”开始

很多人都在寻找通过副业获得被动收入。我想知道你对被动收入的看法，因为这个词在这个频道的评论区经常出现，但当我们做**情感分析**（Sentiment Analysis: 对文本中表达的情绪、态度和观点进行识别和提取的技术）时，人们感兴趣的是什么。被动收入似乎有点像一个**流行词**（Buzzword: 指在特定时期内流行且被频繁使用的词语，通常用于营销或炒作）。

<p class="english-text">A lot of people are looking for passive income from side hustles. And I wondered what your your op opinion was on passive income because it's a word that comes up so often in the comment section of this channel, but when we're doing sort of sentiment analysis and what people are what they're interested in. Passive income seems to be a bit of a buzz word.</p>
</details>

是的，它是灵丹妙药，对吧？它就像是，你可以说是金融界的**圣杯**（Oic: 可能是“Olympic”的误写，但结合语境“silver bullet”和“financial”，更可能是“Holy Grail”的谐音，指极难获得但极具价值的东西）。

什么是被动收入？一个人会如何定义它？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is passive income? How would how would one define that?</p>
</details>

我会将其定义为你在无需持续投入精力的情况下获得的收入，比如购买国债，赚取4%的收益，你什么都不做就能获得报酬。这很难找到，尤其是在早期。我们必须愿意创造**主动收入**（Active Income: 需要持续投入时间和精力才能获得的收入），**汗水收入**（Sweaty Income: 指通过辛苦劳动赚取的收入），**丑陋收入**（Ugly Income: 指那些不那么“光鲜”或“性感”，但实际有效的收入），不惜一切代价。我们做得越多，做得越久，真正的被动收入就越现实。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I would define it as income that you receive um that you don't have to continually put effort towards like uh buying treasuries, earning 4% on on your money and you don't do anything and you just get paid. And it's it's very hard to find especially early on. Like we have to be willing to create active income, sweaty income, ugly income, like by whatever means necessary. And the more we do that, the longer we do that, the more um realistic true passive income actually is.</p>

汗水收入，丑陋收入。

<p class="english-text">Sweaty, ugly income.</p>

是的。给我举一些任何人现在都能创造的汗水收入、丑陋收入的例子。你最喜欢哪些人们已经启动的、不那么显眼的业务，但最终产生了被动、汗水、丑陋收入的例子？

<p class="english-text">Yeah. Give me an example of some sweaty, ugly income that anyone listening right now could could create. What are your favorite examples of non-obvious businesses that people have started that have resulted in passive, sweaty, ugly income?</p>
</details>

是的，我的意思是，我启动的大多数事情都是如此。我曾经有一个**礼宾式购车业务**（Concierge Car Buying Business: 为客户提供个性化购车服务的业务）。

<p class="english-text">Yeah, I mean, most things that I've started have been just that. I had a uh a concierge car buying business. Um</p>

所以，想象一个传统的汽车经销商，一个二手车经销商。你必须获得你的经销商许可证。这使你能够合法地去拍卖行，以批发价购买汽车，把它们放在你的场地里，然后出售。所以我做了所有监管方面的工作。我获得了我的经销商许可证，但后来我会去找个人，他们会说：“我想要一辆2024年的**Sequoia**（Sequoia: 丰田汽车公司生产的一款大型SUV），我想要蓝色的，里程低于3万英里。”我就会去拍卖行，以大约700美元的费用为他们购买。所以，他们获得了批发价，节省了钱，我赚了钱，我不需要承担库存风险，而且我可以购买他们想要的东西。嗯，这听起来很棒，对吧？理论上。人们成功地经营着这种业务。我没有发明它。我复制了它，对吧？我讨厌它。我开车把这些东西从拍卖行运回来时，经常在路边抛锚。我不是一个爱车的人。我不在乎汽车。我不修车。那不是我的激情。那很糟糕。德克萨斯州很热。我站在柏油路上。我在赚钱。它是有利可图的。我到了一个地步，我就是放弃了。我就是把它关了。转向了其他事情。那是非常主动的。表面上它不可扩展。它很糟糕。我讨厌它。所以我**转向**（Pivoted: 指在商业中改变策略或方向）了，因为我有一个B计划。我不需要做那件事，对吧？那是一个例子。如果有人喜欢汽车，这实际上是一个很棒的业务。我认识阿拉巴马州的一位先生，他通过这种方式赚了很多钱，对吧？对我来说，这并不好。

<p class="english-text">So, picture a traditional car dealership, a used car dealership. You got to get your dealer's permit. That uh enables you legally to go to the auctions and buy cars at wholesale, put them on your lot, and sell them. So, I did all the regulatory stuff. I got my my dealer's permit, but then I would go to individuals and they would say, "I want a 2024 Seoia. I want it to be blue, under 30,000 mi." and I would just go to the auction and buy it for them for like $700 fee. So, they get wholesale, they save money, I make money, I don't have to bear the inventory risk and I can buy exactly what they want. Um, that sounds great, right? On paper. People do that business successfully. I didn't invent it. I copied it, right? I hated it. Uh, I was breaking down on the side of the road driving these things back from the auction. I'm not a car guy. I don't care about cars. I don't work on cars. It's not my passion. That was ugly. It was hot in Texas. I was standing out on the black top. I was making money. It was profitable. And I got to the point where I just like quit it. I just shut it down. Moved on to something else. Um that was very active. It was not scalable on the surface. It was ugly. I hated it. And so I pivoted because I had a plan B. I didn't have to do that, right? Um that's one example. Uh if someone likes cars, it's it's a actually a great business. Like I know a gentleman in Alabama that makes a lot of money doing that, right? For me it was it was not great.</p>

那么，在这种情况下，激情有多重要？在你看来，热爱你所做的事情对成功有多重要？

我认为你需要爱上商业，爱上贸易。如果你能热爱创业，把1美元变成2美元，如果你能把这作为你的激情，那么你就能在任何与之相关的事情上取得成功，对吧？但我喜欢说：**追逐利润，直到你能负担得起追逐激情**。对吧？因为如果我们从第一天起就试图追逐激情，我们可能永远也无法实现，因为我们所热爱的东西和能赚钱的东西在开始时重叠的统计可能性几乎为零。所以，暂时忽略激情。尝试围绕商业建立你的激情。然后开始做任何事情。然后一旦你能够拥有更多的被动收入， then start things that you're passionate about like in the in the actual industry that you're passionate about.

<p class="english-text">I think you need to fall in love with business with commerce and if you can love entrepreneurship turning $1 into two and that like if you could focus on that being your passion then anything that falls underneath that you should win at, right? But I I like to say follow the profit. pro fit T. Um, until you can afford to follow your passion, right? Because if we're trying to follow our passion from day one, we're probably not ever going to get there because the statistical likelihood that what we love and what makes us money overlaps in the beginning is almost zero. So, ignore passion for a time. Try to build your passion around commerce. Um, and then start anything. And then once you're able to have more passive income, then start things that you'
