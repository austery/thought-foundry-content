### 安德鲁王子被捕

**David**: 大家好。应广大观众要求，我们今天做一期关于 **Jeffrey Epstein** 的专题节目。我的好伙伴们都去休滑雪假了，所以我独自主持。我们请到了三位嘉宾，他们对爱泼斯坦事件有着截然不同的解读和观点。来自《Breaking Points》的 **Saagar Enjeti** 认为，爱泼斯坦案表明存在一个凌驾于法律和问责之上的“**爱泼斯坦阶层**”，他将此视为对统治精英的控诉。**Michael Tracey** 则对许多关于爱泼斯坦的耸人听闻的指控持怀疑态度，质疑它们是否符合证据标准，他批评媒体的狂热并称之为“**爱泼斯坦神话**”。最后是 **Kevin Bass**，一位一直追踪公开文件并在 X 上发布发现的公民记者，特别是针对 **Reed Hoffman**——这位可能是科技界与爱泼斯坦联系最紧密的人物。讨论可能会很激烈，但希望你们能获得新的视角。我努力保持开放的心态，并在节目最后阐述我的观点。那么，我们开始吧。Saagar，先从你开始。今天早上**安德鲁王子**在英国被捕意味着什么？这是否属于“先抓人，再定罪”的情况？他被捕似乎并非因为爱泼斯坦案中的不当行为，而是因为处理**商业机密**或公共文件不当。显然，这个时机并非巧合。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Okay, everyone. By popular demand, we're doing an all Epstein show today. My besties are all on vacation for ski week, so I'm taking this on solo. We have three different guests on who all have very different interpretations and opinions of the Epstein story. Sagar Enjeti from Breaking Points believes that the Epstein shows that there is a quote unquote Epstein class that operates above law and accountability. He views the story as an indictment of our ruling elites. Michael Tracey is skeptical about many of the most salicious claims about Epstein and questions whether they meet any kind of evidentiary standard. He has criticized the media feeding frenzy over what he has called Epstein mythology. And finally, Kevin Bass, a citizen journalist who's been tracking the release files and posting his findings on X, specifically in regards to Reed Hoffman, perhaps the figure in tech most closely associated with Jeffrey Epstein. Some of it gets heated, but hopefully you'll come away with new perspectives and great information. I felt like it was important to showcase a range of viewpoints on this issue. I'm trying to keep an open mind and I'll describe my own point of view at the end of the show. And with that, here we go. Sager, let me start with you. What is the import of the arrest of Prince Andrew in the UK this morning? I mean, is this a case of show us the man and we'll tell you the crime? I mean, it obviously it seems kind of coincidental that he's not being arrested for misconduct in the Epstein affair. He's being arrested on mishandling, I guess, trade secrets or public documents. So, obviously, the timing of this is not coincidental.

</details>

**Saagar**: 的确不是巧合，但我相信事实在这一案件中非常重要。不幸的是，对于安德鲁王子和前英国驻美大使 **Lord Mandelson** 来说，他们确实违反了公职职责。我们要记住，涉及安德鲁的案件核心不仅是那些指控，尽管那是调查的起源。这关乎安德鲁王子担任英国贸易顾问期间，向 Jeffrey Epstein 转发非公开信息。目前已公布的文件中，有些涉及日程安排。然而，**Gordon Brown** 今天早上表示，他实际上向苏格兰场提供了新信息。所以，这不完全是文件里的内容，可能还涉及 Gordon Brown 和财政部能够调查的其他材料，作为对 Lord Mandelson 及其向爱泼斯坦通报即将到来的**紧急救援计划**的更广泛调查的一部分。我认为这揭示了爱泼斯坦很多东西：他权力、财富和影响力的起源。这涉及深厚的**洗钱网络**财务知识，试图处于全球资金流动的最前沿，我相信这才是他真正的权力和影响力所在，也正是这种能力让他能够做出那些令公众震惊的行为。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saagar**: No, it's certainly not coincidental, but I do believe that the facts do matter in this case. And unfortunately, you know, for Prince Andrew, for Lord Mandelson, the former ambassador to the United States from the UK as well, it is pretty clear-cut that they did violate their official duties. We should remember that the crux of this case involving Andrew is not just about some of the accusations that were made, although that is the genesis, let's say, of the investigation and of the interest. This is about Prince Andrew serving as a UK trade adviser and forwarding non-public information to Jeffrey Epstein has been released that's currently in the file. Some of it is involving scheduling. However, Gordon Brown this morning said that he had actually shared some new information with Scotland Yard in the police. So, none, it's not exactly just what's in the file, but it could potentially be other material that Gordon Brown and the chancellory were able to investigate as to what Prince Andrew was sharing as part of a broader probe into Lord Mandelson and the tip off that he gave to Jeffrey Epstein about an upcoming bailout. And I do think that this does reveal quite a lot about Jeffrey Epstein. The next is the genesis of his rise to power, his wealth, and his influence. something that involved let's say even some of the co-hosts let's say on this very podcast which is a deep financial knowledge of moneyaundering networks of trying to be at the very forefront of moving money across the globe which I believe is his real power and his influence which is what enabled much of the behavior that much of the public is now horrified by.

### 比特币与早期权势

**David**: 等等，我不能就这么放过去。你说的“涉及本播客的联合主持人”是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: okay wait I I can't let that just go by what do you mean by involving co-host of this podcast?

</details>

**Saagar**: 我说的是 **Jason**。我其实觉得 Jason 的那封邮件非常有趣。你会看到在 2011 年，Jeffrey Epstein 就为了 **Bitcoin** 联系过 Jason。我看过你们的讨论，我并不是在指控他犯罪。我是说，如果你仔细观察那封邮件，你会看到爱泼斯坦作为一个洗钱高手和财务天才，在 2011 年就站在了比特币技术的最前沿并对其感到好奇。正如 Jason 在上一集提到的，当时比特币才 1 美元左右，还是个开源项目。对我来说，这显示了他对新技术和秘密转移资金的新方式是多么敏锐，我相信这正是他的核心实力，也是他能够对各种外国政府和**情报资产**（包括我们的、俄罗斯的、以色列的）如此有用的原因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saagar**: I'm talking about Jason. I actually thought that the Jason email was Very interesting. So you'll see that in 2011 that Jeffrey Epstein is contacting Jason about Bitcoin. This is by I saw I watched your discussion. I'm not implicating him in any crime. I'm saying if you watch and look at that email very closely, you are watching Jeffrey Epstein, a master money launderer and financial mastermind himself, be at the forefront of the Bitcoin technology and wondering about it in 2011, which as Jason even pointed out in the last episode that you guys did about this when Bitcoin was some $1 and some sort of open-source project. Like to me that shows how at the forefront he was of new technology and new ways to move money surreptitiously across the globe, which is what I believe was his real strength and his basically um his his uh raise on detra for being so useful to all of these different foreign governments and intelligence assets including ours, Russia, Israel, various different Israeli or various different intelligence networks across the globe.

</details>

**David**: 为了没看过那一集的观众，我简单总结一下发生了什么，以确保 Jason 的名誉不被不公平地玷污。当时 Jason 在 2011 年左右主持了一集《This Week in Startups》，请了几位比特币核心创始人，然后爱泼斯坦联系他，希望能引荐那些人。我的感触之一是，正如你所说，爱泼斯坦对比特币的关注非常早。他显然嗅觉灵敏，总能把自己置于风口浪尖。我觉得滑稽的是，Jason 当时试图警告爱泼斯坦：“噢，你不会想见这些人的，他们是一群疯子，像那种加密无政府主义者，想推翻政府，这里没有利润或投资机会。” 某种程度上，Jason 警告爱泼斯坦避开比特币人士，而不是反过来，这挺逗的。但我不认为当时人们知道爱泼斯坦参与了什么。你不同意吗？你认为 2011 年人们就该知道吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Yeah, let me just for for viewers of this episode who didn't see that episode, let me just summarize what exactly happened there because I want to just make sure that Jason's reputation is not unfairly impuged. And I don't think you're doing that, but just to be absolutely clear about it, what happened was that Jason hosted an episode of This Week in Startups roughly, I think in 2011, with a couple of the Bitcoin core founders and then Epstein reached out to him for an introduction to those people. I thought and and one of my takeaways from that was like you said Sagar that Epste was extraordinarily early to Bitcoin. He clearly had a nose for putting himself in the middle of things. I think 2011 is when I discovered Bitcoin. So that was relatively early. I thought it was almost comical the way that Jason was trying to warn Epstein, oh, you don't want to meet these guys. These are some these are some crazies. They're like these crypto libertarians. They want to take down the government. There's no profit. Um there's no investment opportunity here. In a way, it was kind of comical that Jason was trying to warn Epstein about the Bitcoin guys rather than vice versa. But I don't really think people knew at that point in time what Epstein was involved in. Do you disagree with that? Do you think people should have known by 2011?

</details>

**Saagar**: David，我是说，我们可以通过“时光机”去查当时的谷歌搜索结果。我们面对的是一个已经认罪的人。每个人可以有自己的判断，但你不可能搜不到关于“**引诱未成年人卖淫**”的内容，那已经是公开记录了。我只能代表我自己，即便是在专业层面，我也不会和这样的人打交道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saagar**: Well, David, I mean, I will say there is a way back machine and we can go back and we can look at what the Google results were and we do have somebody who pled guilty. And look, I mean, this is for every individual to make up their own mind. You can't Google for solicitation of prostitution involving a minor. I mean, that was literally a matter of public record. I can only speak for myself. That's not really somebody I would involve myself with, even at a professional level. Uh, and had you known?

</details>

**David**: 但当时并没有被广泛宣传。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: but it wasn't widely publicized at the time.

</details>

**Saagar**: 《棕榈滩邮报》当时有很多新闻报道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saagar**: Palm Beach Post. There were numerous news articles.

</details>

**David**: 我以为《迈阿密先驱报》的报道直到 2018 年才出来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: I thought the Palm Beach story didn't come out until or sorry, maybe it was the Miami Herald didn't come out till 2018.

</details>

**Saagar**: 你说的是 2018 年那种更广泛的报道，但最初涉及未成年人的指控，我记得 **不予起诉协议**（NPA）是在 2007 年达成的。关于**性犯罪者登记**的内容都是公开记录。你可以去查。这不一定意味着参与者犯罪，但这些信息确实存在，并不是不为人知，暗示它不为人知是不负责任的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saagar**: Well, you're Yeah, you're talking about the 2018 kind of the broader story, but the original solicitation of prosecution involving a minor charge, 2007, I believe, is when the nonprosecution agreement came to bear. That was all public record in terms of registration of a sex offender. And again, you can use the way back machine and you can go back and look. I mean again this doesn't necessarily implicate anybody in a crime and anybody can make up the decision for themselves as to how they would have uh you know involved themselves with that person but it was it was out there like it wasn't uh unknown and I do think it's not really responsible to imply otherwise.

</details>

### 爱泼斯坦神话质疑

**Michael Tracey**: 做个快速的事实澄清：虽然当时不是大新闻，但你可以在 2008 年 7 月的《纽约时报》上找到相关报道，就在爱泼斯坦对两项州级卖淫指控认罪之后。显然我们当时没有掌握他被指控的全部信息，也不清楚不予起诉协议的性质，但当时的谷歌搜索确实能搜到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Tracey**: Quick factual clarification on that although it wasn't an enormous story at the time. You can find coverage in the New York Times in July of 2008 after Epstein pleaded guilty to the two state level prostitution charges. We didn't have the full scope of the information obviously about what he was accused of or the nature of the nonprosecution agreement, but a Google search would have yielded that at that time.

</details>

**David**: 很难评判。我在那个时期确实从未听说过 Jeffrey Epstein，我想大多数人也没听说过。这什么时候变成一个全民关注的话题的？是在 2018 年左右吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Yeah, it's hard for me to judge. I certainly in that time period had never even heard of Jeffrey Epstein and I don't think most people had. When did this become sort of a cause celeb? I mean, wasn't it more around his 2018? I would say

</details>

**Michael Tracey**: 2018 年。当时《迈阿密先驱报》由 **Julie K. Brown** 撰写的那个被极度高估的系列报道——里面充满了错误和歪曲——在媒体界引起了轰动。她被各种虚假的行业组织授予了无数荣誉。尽管我在她的书《Perversion of Justice》中抓到了她伪造引言。Michael，我不认为你会否认，虽然是由她的报道引发的，但最终一个审查了不予起诉协议的联邦法官确实说过，这违反了《**犯罪受害者权利法**》。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Tracey**: 2018. Yeah, I think it's important to explain and when the incredibly overrated Miami Herald series by Julie K. Brown, which is just r rife with errors and mischaracterizations became this sensation across the media landscape and Julie K. Brown was showered with all these accolades from all these bogus journalism industry organizations. Even though, for example, I caught her fabricating quotes in her book, Coversion of Justice, which was based on the initial Miami Herald series. But Michael, I don't think that you would clownish people in the journalism landscape. Michael, I don't think that you would deny that ultimately that this did not Yes, it was sparked by Julie K. Brown's Miami Herald story is that a federal judge was not necessarily like, you know, a federal judge who reviewed the nonprosecution agreement did say that this was a violation of the Crime Victim's Rights Act because

</details>

**Michael Tracey**: 那在抗诉中被推翻了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Tracey**: that was overturned on appeal.

</details>

**Saagar**: 我明白，但这也提交到了最高法院，涉及 **Ghislaine Maxwell**。据我所知，目前仍在诉讼中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saagar**: Right. Well, I understand, however, that this has also gone forth to the Supreme Court involving Gain Maxwell. As I understand now, is currently being litigated. But I do think it is important.

</details>

**Michael Tracey**: 最高法院驳回了。我说的是 Maxwell 的上诉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Tracey**: The Supreme Court rejected it. Yeah, that's what I'm what I'm talking about. Maxwell's appeal appeal.

</details>

**Saagar**: 我说的是 Maxwell 的上诉，但具体到不予起诉协议和被推翻，正是这些导致了 2019 年对 Jeffrey Epstein 的重新起诉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saagar**: I'm talking about the Maxwell appeal, but specifically the nonprosecution agreement and the overturning is what re led to the current indictment of the 2019 indictment of Jeffrey Epste. No,

</details>

**Michael Tracey**: 那是不对的，Saagar。这是一个误解。不予起诉协议从未被推翻。Ghislaine Maxwell 的论点包括引用该协议，声称她应该受到保护，从而免受 2020 年启动的联邦起诉。该协议从未被废除或宣告无效。受害者律师 **Bradley Edwards** 曾试图说服联邦法官废除它，但他失败了。Jeffrey Epstein 在 2019 年被联邦重新起诉的原因是，纽约南区（**SDNY**）的检察官们编造了一个荒谬的理由，声称他们在纽约发现了一名新受害者，从而绕过协议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Tracey**: Yeah. I mean, this is a misconception. The nonprosecution agreement was never overturned. Gileain Maxwell's argument includes Let me just finish. Sure. Gileain Maxwell's argument in her appeals included citing the nonprosecution agreement as something that she claimed she ought to have been covered by. Yes. And therefore insulated from federal prosecution which was initiated against her in 2020. The nonprosecution agreement was never nullified. It was never voided. Bradley Edwards, the victim lawyer, attempted to convince federal judges to somehow nullify it, but he failed. The reason why Jeffrey Epstein was federally reprosecuted in 2019 is because prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, Moren Comey at all, concocted this cockamame rationale for how they could circumvent the nonprosecution agreement by picking claiming they found a new victim in New York, claiming that there was some interstate nexus in which they could tie some of the old Florida allegations, but it was never nullified at all.

</details>

### 情报背景与权力崛起

**David**: 好了各位，让我重新掌控一下局面。我觉得我们陷入了细节的泥潭。我认为我们应该单独评判每一个与爱泼斯坦互动或访问过他岛屿的人，看他们到底做了什么，到底知道什么。Saagar，我觉得你对 Jason 有点不公平，因为他在 2011 年只是交换了几封邮件。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: All right, guys. Let me let me just get control of this again because I think we're going down a rabbit hole and there's lots of aspects of this story that that we could discuss. I think that we should probably judge each person who interacted with Epstein or visited his island and so forth and so on individually in terms of what they actually did, what they actually knew. Sar, I just think you're being a little bit unfair to Jason because all he did was exchange emails with

</details>

**Saagar**: 我想指出的是爱泼斯坦在 2011 年对比特币的了解和兴趣。这与他更广泛的洗钱和税务欺诈行为有关，也涉及他与 **Leon Black** 以及许多付给他巨额资金的亿万富翁的关系。我只是将其视为一个更宏大计划的一部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saagar**: Well, what I was trying to point out was Jeffrey Epstein's knowledge or interest of Bitcoin in 2011. And that links to a broader Epstein involvement with money laundering and tax fraud and so-called involvement with Leon Black and many of these other multi-billionaires who paid him lots of money. I'm just saying I'm putting that as part of into a broader scheme.

</details>

**David**: 是的，那次交流值得注意的原因正如你所说，爱泼斯坦不知为何总能把自己安插在各种事情中间。他就像一个**变色龙式的人物**，在过去几十年许多有新闻价值的故事中都有出现。我想问你们每位一个问题：你们认为这家伙最终到底是谁？爱泼斯坦案到底是怎么一回事？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Yes. And I think that exchange was noteworthy for the reason you just said, which is that Epstein somehow was putting himself in the middle of all sorts of things. I mean, he's almost like a Zeligike figure who pops up in many different newsworthy stories over the last few decades, which is what I think makes this interesting. I think maybe a question for each of you is who do you think this guy ultimately was? I mean, you hear all sorts of theories. Let's say maybe the Epstein maximalist position would be that he was an intelligence asset or intelligence agent who was running a vast compromat operation on his island and thereby was corrupting and blackmailing the world's elite to someone who uh I think Michael you you have a different point of view on that. Let me not characterize it. I'll let you guys do it, but Sagar, let me start with you. Who do you think this guy was? And ultimately, you know, at a 30,000 ft level, what do you think is going on here? What is this Epstein story really about? And then Michael, I want to go to you on the same question.

</details>

**Saagar**: 我认为 Jeffrey Epstein 是一个在 1980 年代非常可疑的条件下崛起的人，可能涉及**伊朗门事件**的内幕，特别是与 Adnan Khashoggi 和 Douglas Leese 等军火商有关。他的黑市洗钱和避税策略在那段时期磨练成熟，最终吸引了像 **Leslie Wexner** 这样的亿万富翁。与此同时，他也有众所周知的性癖好，这些癖好与他的洗钱职责以及对 **CIA** 等情报资产的价值结合在一起，在后冷战环境下变得非常有用。说他在运行一个巨大的“**勒索行动**”（compromat）可能赋予了太多预谋，但他显然在招募和运行一个遍布全球的庞大按摩计划，而这种行为被大量的全球精英所容忍甚至目睹。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saagar**: Yeah, sure. I mean, I do think that there is a very low IQ unfortunate, you know, explosion of accusations that are out there. And I want to be very responsible in the way that I describe it. I think that Jeffrey Epstein was somebody who arose under very suspicious conditions uh in the 1980s potentially involving Iran Contra knowledge specifically with arms traffickers like Adnan Kosigible and Douglas Lease Steven Hoffenberg as well and that these black market moneyaundering tax evasion strategies were honed over a period which eventually inspired various people like Lesie Wexner and many other multi-billionaires and that at the very same time he also had you know his sexual proclivities which I think at this point were wellknown and that those became and became useful his moneyaundering specific uh duties and knowledge and usefulness let's say to the CIA to various other intelligence assets became a very useful part of the nexus in the postcold war environment and that at the time it was also socially known for a lot of Epstein associates that he had this bizarre practice of often you know seeking out massages which In some cases, they are saying involving underage girls. And so to say that he was running a vast compromat operation, I think ascribes too much intention to what's really happening here. And the reason why I'm being intentional in my language is that what he clearly was doing was recruiting and running this like vast massage scheme also involving Gain Maxwell all across the world, Russian and Eastern European women, but also that this behavior was tolerated in some cases seen by a vast number of the global elite.

</details>

### 法律和解与金钱激励

**Michael Tracey**: 我想先声明，这种非要给 Jeffrey Epstein 下一个“定论”的冲动，助长了大量**算法垃圾**的产生，引发了围绕此事的歇斯底里。大多数人认为爱泼斯坦是美国乃至世界历史上最高产的儿童性贩子，这就是为什么这个问题现在可能导致英国政府垮台，牵连挪威，甚至让斯洛伐克的部长辞职。但这种观念是建立在 YouTube 节目、播客和社交媒体红人每天灌输的**神话式废话**之上的，他们受算法驱动，完全脱离事实。我认为这是我成年以来媒体报道最糟糕的一个故事，牵连了非主流媒体、主流媒体以及中间的所有人。我预测，如果两三年后我们再审视这个问题，人们会意识到自己被大规模地忽悠了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Tracey**: I will answer that. However, I do want to just stipulate upfront that I think this reflex to have to offer some kind of totalistic assessment of who Jeffrey Epstein was at, his very essence has fed into so much of the constant churn of algorithmic slop that has generated this hysterical frenzy around this issue and has led to people be totally deluded about what we're even talking about. What do most people I I I have some surmises about Jeffrey Epsteine. He definitely was a money manager who, as you mentioned, was sort of like this Zelig character who did have an extraordinary cross-section of connections with people from across fields. And, you know, I just was looking through some of these records in the new Epstein Files Productions, and I was looking for something else, but there are there's an archive of these old message pads that he had at his Palm Beach house and I'm scrolling through and it turns out Holly Berry left him a couple of messages. I had no idea that Holly Berry was ever in contact with Jeffrey Epstein. So you can always find somebody new and novel who apparently had a one dealing or another with him. But why are we talking about Jeffrey Epstein right now in February of 2026 because PE he is believed to have been the most prolific child sex trafficker in American or perhaps world history which is why this issue might now take down the British government. It's embroiling Norway. A minister in Slovakia had to resign over it. There's a new criminal investigation that was just launched in France, etc. That's what people conceive Jeffrey Epstein to have been. And that whole notion is based on just an onslaught of mythological nonsense that's pumped out daily by these YouTube shows, I won't mention names, podcasts, etc., social media personalities who are driven by these perverse algorithmic incentives to be totally divorced from the facts.

</details>

**Michael Tracey**: 我们从未考虑过巨大的经济动机。我估计“**爱泼斯坦产业**”现在的赔付额约为 10 亿美元，这些钱给了所谓的受害者，他们被允许将 20 年前成年时的经历重新想象为受害过程，然后称自己为性贩运受害者，从而从 **JP Morgan** 那里获得数百万美元的免税资金，而媒体则称赞他们为勇敢的幸存者，却不对他们的指控进行任何核实。你知道为什么人们对爱泼斯坦文件中的遮掩感到愤怒吗？我也很愤怒。我批评了 **Thomas Massie** 和 **Ro Khanna** 起草的《爱泼斯坦文件透明法案》，因为他们与 Bradley Edwards 这个敲诈勒索式的受害者律师合作，在法案中加入了一个巨大的豁免条款，授权司法部遮掩任何可能与“受害者身份识别”有细微联系的信息。如果真正实现完全透明，可能会破坏大家如此轻信的“幸存者叙事”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Tracey**: foreground this rampant speculation that ties in the Mossad, ties in unnamed other intelligence agencies with this presumed implication or this presumed uh reality that of course we know for sure that Jeffrey Epste was running this pedto crime ring and we all so they they presuppose a conclusion that's just been floating out there in the ether thanks to all this horrendous media coverage. I think this is the worst story of my adult lifetime in terms of the media coverage and it implicates the alternative media, the mainstream media and everybody in between. It's actually shocking. I will predict here and now that if we revisit this issue in I don't know two or three years, people will come to realize if I have anything to do with it that they were bamboozled on a mass scale. There's genuine fraud that has been rampant in ter the journalistic malfeasants. We're not supposed to ever consider the massive financial incentives where the Epstein industry is now something like I've estimated a billion dollars in terms of the payouts that have been given to purported victims who are allowed to just reimagine things that happened to them 20 years before as an adult, not as a child, but adult at the time of their claim victimization and then call themselves a sex trafficking victim and then they can secure a couple million dollars tax-free from JP Morgan and the media will hail them as these brave survivors without doing a single thing to check the veracity of any of their claims. You know why people are so upset about these redactions in the Epstein files? And I'm upset too. I criticized Thomas Massie and Roana for the language of their bill that they crafted, the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which they crafted in concert with Bradley Edwards, this extortionist quote unquote victim's lawyer who's made a killing on this issue over the past 10 years in conjunction with David Boy, another shyer. and Bradley Edwards at his urging Roan and Thomas Massie put in this giant carveout to so-called transparency and disclosure into their bill such that the DOJ was authorized to redact or withhold or conceal any information that could be the most tangentially tied to anything that's quote victim identifying.

</details>

**Saagar**: Michael，你拒绝承认女性可能被 Jeffrey Epstein 操纵和伤害。即便涉及金钱交易，将成年女性从东欧空运过来进行性交易也是犯罪。此外，2007 年的起诉书草案中提到了多名未成年受害者，爱泼斯坦曾问一名 15 岁女孩是否认识更年轻的人。所以，你认为他不是“**恋童癖**”的核心论点显然是不成立的。人们之所以关注这个故事，是因为它证实了人们的一种普遍怀疑：即在美国或全球社会的最高层，人们在道德和财务往来上可以肆无忌惮且不受惩罚。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saagar**: Well, I do, Michael. I think we can at least agree that Cash Patel and Pam Bondi haven't uh handled this all that responsibly on that particular issue. Oh, oh, well, I mean, you're asking me to correct the record of something I've never even uttered. I've never said the word. It's literally not something that I've ever claimed. I mean, I do think, Michael, uh, that what you like to do is to go after, and really, I think fundamentally, I'm not even sure if you would reject this. You reject the idea of victimization, that post victimization, uh, can't even happen. And I also, I don't even necessarily want to get the idea of victimization. I don't even know what that means. Well, you reject the idea that women could be victimized, uh, let's say, by Jeffrey Epste, manipulated. Yes. in even if some cases money were exchanging hands. I will say, by the way, that just paying or flying in adult women from Eastern Europe to for the express purposes of having sex is a crime, by the way. Sure, it's not underage. However, we do have the 2007 draft indictment where there were a number of underage victims that were mentioned there where Epstein specifically asked a 15-year-old if he knows anybody who's younger uh that he could be able to recruited. And so, I do think your core contention that at the end of the day, he was a quote pedophile uh is definitely illegitimate.

### 韦克斯纳的财务谜团

**David**: 好了，Saagar 时间有限，我再问几个问题。关于 **Leslie Wexner** 前几天的证词，我们学到了什么？爱泼斯坦是如何起家的？他如何在职业生涯早期积累数亿美元？他如何获得那些与情报界的联系？

**David**: All right, guys. Let me let me just get control of this again because I think we're going down a rabbit hole and there's lots of aspects of this story that that we could discuss. I think that we should probably judge each person who interacted with Epstein or visited his island and so forth and so on individually in terms of what they actually did, what they actually knew. Sar, I just think you're being a little bit unfair to Jason because all he did was exchange emails with ... listen let me ask you a couple other questions and then once leaves Michael we can get you to say what you want to say I want to go to the less waxner deposition the other day. What did we learn from that specifically about how Epstein got his start? I do think that there are these questions about again who this guy was, how did he accumulate hundreds of millions of dollars so early in his career? How did he seem to um obtain all these different uh connections specifically to the intelligence world? Did any of that get resolved? And what what's your take on that?

**Saagar**: 并没有解决。Leslie Wexner 声称爱泼斯坦是一个骗子，偷了他几十年的钱。但在 1991 年，他签署了**授权委托书**（Power of Attorney）交给爱泼斯坦。爱泼斯坦对 Wexner 的财务和 Wexner 基金会有着惊人的控制权，他利用这些资金资助以色列前总理 **Ehud Barak**。Wexner 甚至不否认爱泼斯坦对他财务的巨大控制，甚至声称被爱泼斯坦偷了钱，他们的关系据称在 2007 年结束，但他尚未在公开场合回答这些问题。我个人希望能看到那份证词的全文。David，你是一个高净值人士，你会把你的财务交给 Jeffrey Epstein 吗？这太诡异了。

**Saagar**: No, David, it wasn't resolved. Unfortunately, the entire transcript is not public. What we do know from the House Oversight Committee, at least what's been released now so far is Leslie Wexner said he was never questioned ever once by the FBI or the Department of Justice involving this case. I will say if you look at the track record of Leslie Wexner, it's incredibly bizarre. He claims that Epstein was a con man who stole his money for decades. In 1991, we had the power of attorney that was signed over to him. He claims that Epstein was a financial genius and a wizard. We have the transferring of the town home which eventually there was some payment uh that was reconciled uh on the back end. But an incredible amount of control that Jeffrey Epstein had over Leslie Wexner's finances over the Wexner Foundation which he used to funnel money to Aud Barack the former prime minister of Israel support many Zionist causes under the Wexner Foundation including the Wexner Fellowship currently at Harvard University. I do think it's important for us to explore some more of that. There's some very odd dealings with the beginnings of their relationship.

**David**: 他是在 **Bear Stearns** 开始职业生涯的吧？他 20 岁左右大学辍学，然后在 **Dalton School** 当了一年老师，接着在 Bear Stearns 工作了四年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Yeah. So, he he began his career, I guess, at Bear Sterns. I guess it was a brief stint where he worked I guess he one of the curious things about him is he dropped out of college around age 20. I guess he was studying math. He then was a teacher at the Dalton School for like a year, correct? And then he worked at Bear Sterns for four years.

</details>

**Saagar**: 他通过 Dalton School 认识了 **Ace Greenberg**。他在 Bear Stearns 工作几年后被解雇，那之后他开始坠入我所说的“黑暗面”，磨练他在洗钱方面的专长，包括伪造护照、伊朗门军火走私等。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saagar**: He met Ace Greenberg through the Dalton School. Greenberg's I think it was it was either one of his children uh was there and then he went to Bear Sterns. He's fired from Beer Sterns after a couple of years and that's when his descent into what I call like the darkness his expertise in moneyaundering. I believe that that's when it was honed as reflects in the record and the testimony of the people who dealt with him there at the time including the false passport Iran contour arm smuggling and all of that that I've laid out.

### 里德·霍夫曼的文件

**David**: 好的，Michael，我想给你个机会陈述你的观点。你认为现在发生的是一种“**道德恐慌**”或集体癔症，你将其比作**萨勒姆审巫案**和 1980 年代的“**撒旦恐慌**”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: All right. So Michael let me kind of reset here. Okay. I'm I'm not sure you've had a chance to kind of lay out your case for what you called Epstein mythology. Yeah. So, I want to give you a chance to kind of just lay out your thesis here that what's happening is actually a type of moral panic or feeding frenzy, a type of hysteria. You've compared it to the Salem witch trials. Yeah. There was also the case in the 1980s of the whole day child abuse. Satanic panic. the satanic where I think hundreds of people went to jail or were prosecuted for that. It turned out I don't know if it was hundreds but more than enough to make it a extreme miscarriage of justice. So that's the comparison you've made.

</details>

**Michael Tracey**: 撒旦恐慌的相似之处在于，人们通过阅读邮件片段来暗示某种关于食人或邪恶祭祀的密码信息。1980 年代那些最噩梦般的场景被指控并被当局严肃对待，结果证明是一场巨大的骗局。这种“爱泼斯坦神话”主要是在 2014 年随着 **Virginia Roberts Giuffre** 及其律师提出的新指控而发展的，她声称自己被全球性贩运，并指控了 **Alan Dershowitz**、安德鲁王子等人。但如果你仔细观察，Giuffre 是一个精神极度不稳定的人，却被神圣化为真理的殉道者。还有另外两名精神有问题的女性，Maria Farmer 和 Sarah Ransom，她们引入了爱泼斯坦在所有卧室安装摄像头进行勒索的说法。尽管大家都在喊“强奸岛”或“恋童癖岛”，但从未在那座岛上发现过任何可靠的强奸指控。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Tracey**: In terms of the satanic panic parallel, that's not one that I would have necessarily been most inclined to bring up until recently just because there's now this new layer of the mythology that's added been added with the production of these Epstein quote files where people are reading snippets of emails to signify some kind of coded messaging around cannibalism or around grotesque child sacrifice. that really wasn't a hallmark of the Epstein story so much before this enormous tunch of emails were released. And it relates to the satanic panic frenzy in so far as claims around such things as like truly grotesque child sacrifice, mutilation of infants, you know, bathing toddlers in blood. Like all the most nightmarish scenarios you could possibly dream up were alleged in the 1980s and taken deadly seriously by the authorities resulting in as you alluded to a good number of people actually being thrown in prison for many years and it was turn it was found to be just a gigantic hoax. ... Virginia Roberts Giuffre was a profoundly disturbed mentally unwell person who was validated and legitimized and now continues to be celebrated as some kind of martyr for truth. ... Maria Farmer is one of these other definitely mentally ill persons who, for example, introduced or was integral in introducing this idea that Epstein had cameras set up in all his bedrooms and bathrooms and was surreptitiously recording prominent people so he could use it for blackmail.

</details>

**David**: 让我们谈谈 **Kevin Bass**。你是一位对爱泼斯坦文件感兴趣的创业者，你使用 AI 进行了分析，特别是关于 **Reed Hoffman** 的部分。Reed 在 2019 年声明称他与爱泼斯坦只有“几次互动”，且都是应 Joi Ito 的要求为 **MIT 媒体实验室**筹款。这个声明准确吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Let me put a pin in that cuz I want to let Kevin Bass get in here. I've been following your feed quite a bit. You are basically a startup entrepreneur who got interested in in the Epstein files. I think you used AI to analyze them. And in particular, you've been looking at Reed Hoffman's story about Epstein, and you've put together an analysis. I think you've called it the Reed Hoffman Files. ... Maybe a place to start is with Reed Hoffman's statement in 2019 to Axios. ... Reed's statement at that time was the following: "My few interactions with Jeffrey Epstein came at the request of Joey Itto for the purposes of fundraising for the MIT Media Lab. ... My last interaction with Epste was in 2015." Is that statement accurate?

</details>

**Kevin Bass**: 完全不准确。事实上，他今年 2 月还在 X 上重复这一说法。但文件显示，爱泼斯坦和里德·霍夫曼之间的关系看起来几乎像死党。在 2013 年到 2019 年间，霍夫曼主动发起的联系大约有 400 次。他们的助手保持着密切联系，有广泛的财务往来。记录在案的会面大约有 42 次，其中 20 次是绝对确认的。他们一起吃早餐，在对方家里过夜。霍夫曼声称只在岛上待过一晚，但记录显示至少是两晚，而且几乎肯定还有第二次或第三次访问。霍夫曼是爱泼斯坦进入**硅谷**科技圈的主要门户。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kevin Bass**: Not at all. Uh, and in fact, it's not just from 2019. Uh, he even reiterated this on February 4th this year on X repeatedly. ... Like, none of that's uh at all true. Uh there's very few mentions of even fundraising with MIT. I would even go so far as to say I don't know. I I've said it this way on on some of my posts, but it's like the extent of the relationship between Epstein and Reed Hoffman, it almost looks like best friends. ... there are constant contact uh there's something around on the order of about 400 initiations by Hoffman to Epstein. It wasn't just mediated by Joe Eito at all. And uh you know there's their their sec their assistants were in constant contact with each other. They had extensive financial relationships. There's something like 42 different meetings uh that are documented. Around 20 are absolutely confirmed. Uh they met in in person for breakfast. They would uh spend each other spend each other spend time with each other's at each other's houses overnight meet um you know Epstein met his wife. It is claimed that by Hoffman that he only was there for one night. Even the one time that we have absolutely document that documented that uh he's referring to he was there for two nights and almost certainly there was two other island visits as well in addition.

### 党派化与事实真相

**David**: 那么问题来了，为什么 Reed 要如此厚颜无耻地撒谎？我认为他在玩一种经典的“**围魏救赵**”策略：通过疯狂指控埃隆·马斯克和唐纳德·特朗普，他试图躲进民主党阵营的保护伞下，毕竟他捐了数亿美元。而媒体似乎也给了他通行证。《纽约时报》写了一篇关于爱泼斯坦与硅谷联系的文章，其他联系较少的人都有专门段落，而里德·霍夫曼只在一句话中被顺带提及。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Well, and but here's the question is why did Reed so brazenly lie about his relationship with Epstein? ... my theory on this, I think it's kind of obvious what he's doing, is that by pointing the finger at Trump or Elon, actually both, he's driving everyone into their partisan tribes, right? So, as to, I think, seek protection of the Democrat tribe to which he's contributed hundreds of millions of dollars. And I think it's worked. I mean, you look at the mainstream media coverage of this, the New York Times coverage of it... They wrote an article about Epstein's ties to Silicon Valley. Other people who had far less extensive of a relationship with Epstein got paragraphs in that story. Reed Hoffman was only mentioned in one sentence along with three other people. So, he does seem to be getting a pass from the media.

</details>

**Michael Tracey**: 这正说明了整个事件是如何被武器化的。爱泼斯坦的故事被用来服务于预设的政治议程。如果霍夫曼和马斯克互相不喜欢，他们就会指责对方与爱泼斯坦有更深的联系。这变成了一场**泥浆摔跤**。然而，我仍然难以理解，除了他们可能歪曲了关系之外，底层的犯罪指控到底是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Tracey**: Yeah. And I mean, that just goes to show how weaponizable this whole thing is and how the Epstein story or any kind of tangential connection to Epstein can be leveraged to serve some kind of pre-existing agenda. So, if like Reed Hoffman and Elon Musk don't like each other, then they could accuse each other of like having a more a closer connection to Epstein than they did. And it's just like a uh a slugfest. And yet, I'm still struggling to understand like what the underlying accusation of wrongdoing is supposed to be.

</details>

**David**: 我觉得我们应该保持开放的心态。如果 Michael Tracey 最终被证明是正确的，我不会感到惊讶；但如果 Saagar 的版本被证明是正确的，我也不会完全惊讶。关键是要批判性地评估这些主张。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Well look I think both of you have performed very valuable services for the public in regards to this whole episode. ... I'm keeping an open mind with respect to what comes out next. It would not surprise me at all if Michael Tracy turned out to be correct but also it wouldn't completely surprise me if some version of Sagar's uh version of the story proved to be correct assuming more evidence comes out. So I'm keeping an open mind.

</details>

**Michael Tracey**: 我也努力做到严格基于证据。我不排除未来会出现破坏我现有假设的新证据。保持这种认识论上的习惯是健康的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Tracey**: I try to be rigorously evidence-based as well myself. So, I don't discount the idea that something could theoretically come out that would undermine some of the assumptions or conclusions that I've derived from my, you know, research and reporting on this. So I think that's a healthy epistemological habit to always be open to the possibility of something that's contra in contravention of your prior assumptions uh being presented to you.

</details>

**David**: 完全同意。感谢各位。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Absolutely. Fully agreed. Okay, we'll leave it there. Thanks, guys.
