### SAP：全球业务的核心驱动力

主持人Nikolai Tangen欢迎了**SAP**（Software AG: 一家德国跨国软件公司，专注于企业应用软件）的首席执行官Christian Klein。他介绍道，SAP是欧洲最大的公司，也是全球第三大软件公司，挪威主权财富基金持有该公司近3%的股份，价值90亿美元，相当于每位挪威人2万挪威克朗。Christian Klein在SAP从学生实习生做起，20年后成为首席执行官，这段职业旅程令人惊叹。

<p class="english-text">Hi everybody. I'm Nicola Tangan, the CEO of the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund and today I'm in really good company with Christian Klein, the CEO of the software giant SAP. Now SAP is now the largest company in Europe, third largest software company in the world and we own just under 3% of the company, $9 billion equivalent to 100 billion Norwegian croner or 20,000 croner per Norwegian. So it's a very big and important position for us. Christian started as a student intern in SAP like 20 years ago. He became the CEO. Wow, what a journey. Christian.</p>
</details>

Nikolai Tangen询问Christian Klein，SAP在全球商业中扮演着怎样的角色，有多少全球业务会触及SAP系统。Christian Klein首先感谢了挪威主权财富基金对SAP的信任，并表示过去四年确实是一段非凡的旅程。他指出，全球80%的**B2B**（Business-to-Business: 企业对企业）交易都与SAP系统相关，而全球95%的大型公司都在使用SAP的某种系统。SAP拥有业界最广泛的**SaaS**（Software as a Service: 软件即服务）产品组合，涵盖财务、供应链、人力资源（HR）等多个领域。

<p class="english-text">Yeah, but you see my quay has first of all now just to get a feel for the importance of SAP. How much of the world's business touches an SAP system? Yeah, Nikolai, first of all, thanks for the trust into SAP and indeed it was a remarkable journey the last four years, but of course you you feel you know the that you know a lot of the world's transactions are relying on SAP systems and now especially with the cloud I mean clients are very serious about you know how do we want their most mission critical systems and to your question 80% of the world's you know B2B transactions one and touching an SAP system wow how much of the largest companies how many of the largest companies in the world actually 95% use one or the other SAP system many of them finance supply chain obviously but we have HR I mean we have probably in the SAS space the broadest portfolio in our industry it's so unbelievable.</p>
</details>

对于不了解**ERP**（Enterprise Resource Planning: 企业资源规划）系统的人，Christian Klein解释说，ERP并非仅仅是后台办公系统，而是连接并运行企业关键业务流程的技术。他举例说明，一家大型汽车制造商希望未来提供“出行即服务”，这需要改变其许可和定价模式，并缩短交付时间，所有这些都与ERP系统紧密相连。SAP的业务覆盖了企业价值链中所有关键部分，甚至延伸到前端的商务和**CX**（Customer Experience: 客户体验）产品组合。他强调，SAP的魅力在于它连接了业务流程，运行着全球最关键的业务流程。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Now for the people who don't know what uh ERP is what so stands for enterprise resource planning system what what kind of things are you involved with I mean there's a lot of talk about digital transformation these days and just you know to maybe illustrate a bit what is the role of an EIP because EIP often times sounds like back office but it's not at all back office you know at the end of the day this morning I had a big you know car manufacturer and they actually want to offer you know mobility as a service in the future so they need to change their license model their pricing model they also want to you know improve delivery times and that is all connected to their EIP yeah the way how you quote the way how you price the way how you manufacture deliver I mean that is all part of an ERP and then we even go to the front line Yeah, with commerce and with our CX portfolio. So, it's really covering the value chain, the mission critical part of each value chain of a company. And here comes also my passion. Yeah, it's it's a piece of technology, Nikolai. But at the end, what it does, it connects business. It actually wants business processes. And that is actually the fascination what is so special about SAP. We are wanting the world's most mission critical business processes.</p>
</details>

### SAP的客户粘性与实施策略

Nikolai Tangen指出，SAP的系统与客户业务深度整合，难以轻易更换，这是否意味着客户被“锁定”了。Christian Klein表示，他不喜欢“锁定”这个词，因为客户看重的是价值。他提到，即使像Apple这样的客户也会挑战SAP，要求更高的生产力，例如自动化供应链。因此，SAP必须不断创新，提供新的解决方案和许可模式，以满足客户的转型需求。他承认，对于运行关键业务的企业来说，ERP系统不会每年更换，这确实是一个“粘性”很强的业务，但这种粘性是SAP通过提供价值赢得的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, one of the reasons why I love SAP is because you're so integrated in people's businesses. Yes. Yes, it's not it's not you can just change your system. So, how often do you lose a client? Okay. And not very often and indeed. Yeah. I mean, but I don't like it when we talk about a lock in of customers in SAP. I mean, they they want to see the value. I mean, first of all, and when we talk to Apple, when we talk about, you know, the their portfolio, I mean, they really also challenge us from time to time. They say, "Hey, we also have to, you know, squeeze for further productivity. How can we automate our supply chain?" And they also then offer new solutions. They want to offer new license modules. So it's it's very important that we also follow you know what our customers you know need for their transformation. And of course when you are running a mission critical business Nikolai I mean you don't change your EIP you know every year. So it's indeed a very sticky business but it's also an earned business.</p>
</details>

关于系统安装的复杂性，Christian Klein解释说，这取决于业务规模和类型。对于拥有数百个仓库或工厂的复杂制造和物流业务，实施时间会较长，因为需要业务部门的深度参与，并在全球范围内部署软件。但对于人力资源或财务等模块，可以实现非常快的**上线**（go-lives: 软件部署或投入使用）。SAP虽然以大型企业ERP闻名，但80%的客户是中型市场企业。如果这些客户遵循SAP的模板和最佳实践，甚至可以在三到四周内上线，这表明SAP也具有很高的敏捷性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But how does it but how much work does it involve to get it installed? Yeah. See I mean that is of course depends how many Yeah. I mean depends on the size and what kind of business you're running. I mean there of course you know when you talk you know about 100 warehouses in the world or factories I mean this is complex business. Yeah. To run manufacturing to run logistics that takes a bit longer but just you know because you also need to involve the business and then implement you know the software all over the world. When we talk about HR about finance you can have really fast go lives. Yeah. And then it of also depends on the size of the customers. I mean we have also SAP is known for you know large enterprises ERPs but we also having actually 80% of our customers are mid-market customers and there when you actually adhere to our template our best practices you can also have go live in three to four weeks absolutely possible if you adhere to the standard if you want to apply the best practices you don't want to configure that much then actually you know SAP is also very agile.</p>
</details>

他进一步指出，公司在引入SAP软件时，往往需要改变工作方式和物流系统。四年前，SAP决定不仅要进行云转型，还要关注变革管理，从最终用户的角度出发。他们会分析用户当前的工作方式，思考未来如何通过自动化让用户专注于更有价值的任务，从而帮助客户不仅在技术层面，也在业务层面实现价值最大化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But companies often also change the way they work right and the logistical systems when they introduce your software. Yes. How does that work? I mean that is actually the part why we also said four years ago we are not only doing a transformation into the cloud. I mean at the end we are wanting mission critical businesses and we want to start with the end users and for them a transformation is a change of the way how they work and the the way how the the company operates and that's why we said let's also focus on not only implementing our technology but also let's focus on the change management start with the end user. they do a piece of work today like that. How will this work look to tomorrow? What kind of automation can we bring in so that the end user can focus on more value adding task? I mean this is you know what SAP does with our clients so that they also maximize the value not only it wise but also business-wise.</p>
</details>

### 定价策略与行业垂直化

Nikolai Tangen提到客户对SAP的依赖性，询问SAP如何考虑提价能力。Christian Klein解释说，SAP的定价首先考虑技术本身，例如**AI**（Artificial Intelligence: 人工智能）产品采用基于消费的定价模式。他们会评估AI用例能带来多少自动化、报价速度提升、定价智能化程度、库存优化效果等，然后根据这些产出来定义价格。客户可以计算成本，同时也能看到自动化、生产力提升和业务运行智能化带来的价值。在通货膨胀方面，SAP承诺公平对待客户，设定了非常合理的最高价格涨幅，但如果通胀较低，涨幅也会相应降低，为客户提供价格保护。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You say you don't um look at it as if you are locking in the customer but I mean they are quite uh what should we say they are very dependent on you. Mhm. How do you think about your ability to increase prices? Just how do you how do you weigh that? I mean first um you know the way how we do our pricing. I mean first of all we look at the piece of technology. I mean AI is a great example. We have a consumption based pricing module. We look into you know what does this AI use case do? How many transactions can you automate? You know how faster can you actually quote? How much more intelligent will your pricing be? How much better can you optimize your inventory? Then we define the output the outcome and then you know the customers can actually calculate you know what does it cost but they also see then the outcome in terms of more automation more productivity more intelligence in the way how they run their business and that is the correlation and then on inflation obviously a big other topic we want to treat our customers very fairly we said look there is a a maximum price increase which is very fair but it also can be lower in case you know inflation is is lower. So we actually do this in my eyes in a very fair manner and so that customers also see they have also a kind of price protection with SAP.</p>
</details>

当被问及是否有尚未充分涉足的垂直行业时，Christian Klein表示SAP已覆盖25个行业，并且在许多行业中进行深度垂直化。他举例说，最近与一家苏格兰公用事业公司讨论了电表计量和电网资产管理，这体现了SAP在产品组合中的深度垂直化。零售行业也是如此，涉及客户忠诚度管理、退货索赔管理等。SAP提供了大量垂直应用，同时客户和合作伙伴也可以在SAP的**BP**（Business Technology Platform: 业务技术平台）上构建扩展应用，利用ERP中的供应链、财务、订单、客户等数据，开发自己的垂直解决方案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Are there any verticals which you haven't really addressed enough yet? I mean actually we won 25 industries and the horizontal layer is actually often times really SAP and then of course in many industries we also go into deep verticalization. I mean just last week I had a Scottish utilities company here. We talk about the metering how to better you know improve asset management for the grids. So there we have also deep verticalization in our in our portfolio. Same for retail when it comes about customer loyalty management, returns claims management. These are the the the verticals we provide and we provide actually a lot of vertical applications and but also customers and partners also can build extensions on our platform because you need data oftent times from the ERP be it supply chain finance data order data customer data and then customers say hey I also want to build my own IP okay here we go you have the our platform called BP there's our data model our identity so you can natively integrate and then you can also build your own vertical solutions also possible.</p>
</details>

### 技术民族主义与数据主权

Nikolai Tangen提到了日益增长的**技术民族主义**（technological nationalism: 国家通过技术政策追求经济和政治利益的趋势），询问这对SAP意味着什么。Christian Klein表示，关税、保护主义和新的主权法律是当前的大问题。SAP在全球140多个国家开展业务，承诺遵守当地法律，不仅包括税收要求，还有**主权云**（sovereign clouds: 满足特定国家数据主权、安全和合规要求的云服务）。SAP正在构建许多主权云，以符合当地关于数据安全、数据访问和数据存储位置的法律。这在当今变得越来越重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the things we've seen more of lately is technological nationalism. Mhm. What what are the issues here for you? Yeah, I mean these days Yeah, it's big. And um you know, tariffs, um you know, protection and new sovereignity, you know, laws and obviously for us, I mean, running businesses in almost over 140 countries. I mean, that is our commitment to our clients. No matter if you do you know business in China, in the US, in Europe, in Southeast Asia, everywhere, we will adhere to to local laws and not only local tax requirements, but also sovereign clouds. So we building now a lot of sovereign clouds um you know based of course on local laws about data security, who's touching the data, data sovereignity, where does the data will be located and that's part of the business I mean and that becomes of course now these days more and more important.</p>
</details>

他观察到，欧洲公司对美国大型供应商的欧洲替代品需求增加。客户会问，如果这种趋势持续下去，他们的数据在流向东方或西方时是否安全。因此，他们明确要求SAP在欧洲本地化更多数据，即使是在非受监管行业。虽然在公共部门和受监管行业，主权云一直是业务的重要组成部分，但现在非受监管行业也越来越关注这一点。虽然客户尚未大规模转移系统，但风险正在增加，不确定性也随之而来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Are you seeing more demand now as European companies want to have a European alternative to some of the large US providers? Yeah, I mean I I see signs for that. Um people customers asking, hey, when this continues, you know, how safe is my data when it goes to the east, when it goes to the west? So they are asking definitely, hey SAP, uh can we also localize our data more and more in Europe even, you know, in nonregulated industries? I mean in the public sector in the regulated industries sovereign cloud was always a big part yeah of the business but also now we see it more and more non-regulated business not that you know customers now suddenly shifting systems already around but you see you know there's the risk is increasing so there's also some uncertainty around that topic absolutely.</p>
</details>

SAP作为全球供应链的核心，其系统是否足够灵活以应对关税、通胀等变化？Christian Klein肯定地表示，尤其是在云端，SAP每季度（如果客户需要，也可以每年）发布新版本，可以快速提供创新，并调整软件以适应全球各地不断出现的各种关税。他指出，作为一家科技公司，SAP希望看到欧洲拥有更大的主权，而不是每个成员国都各自为政。一个统一的欧洲主权将使规模化和开展业务变得更容易。但他对此并不乐观，因为这需要成员国为更大的联盟利益而放弃权力，而说服每个成员国放弃自身主权要求并非易事。他认为，这对于初创企业尤为重要，因为它们需要快速实现价值和规模化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now you sit in the middle of kind of the global supply chain here is there enough agility and flexibility to cope with all these changes in supply chains tariffs inflation all these things. Uh I mean yeah absolutely I mean the tech you know especially in the cloud I mean we deliver you know new releases in the cloud you know every quarter if the customer wants every year but so we can deliver fast innovation. We can also adjust you know our software to adhere to any kind of tariffs you know now which are coming up in every place in the world. The point is of course what we would love to see as a tech company but I'm not only talking about SAP is of course you know to have you know a bigger you know sovereignity across Europe. Yeah not having soenity in each you know member state but really you know having it across Europe because that makes it you know easier to scale and that makes it also easier to do business with and will that happen you think I'm not so optimistic. I mean the point is you know it's same like you know in in a in a private company. Yeah, you need to give up power for the sake of you know for the benefit of the of the bigger union and you know it's it's not always so easy to convince every member state to give up power and say look I actually you know remove my own sovereignity requirements for the sake of having you know one European sovereignity requirement and that that is of but I feel this is of course key not only for for SAP we are doing business everywhere we have our labs everywhere but for the startups I mean you They need scale. They need they need to fast time to value and they need to scale fast and for them of course that would be very very important.</p>
</details>

### 网络安全与云转型

在数据隐私和网络安全方面，Christian Klein强调其重要性。他表示，如果恶意软件侵入系统，后果不堪设想。网络安全是SAP所有客户合同的一部分，有明确的**SLA**（Service Level Agreements: 服务等级协议）规定漏洞发生时的处理方式。SAP投入数十亿美元进行**R&D**（Research & Development: 研发）以保障网络安全，这是公司的强制性要求。他告诉客户，SAP及其**超大规模云服务商**（hyperscaler partners: 指提供大规模云计算基础设施和服务的公司，如AWS、Azure、Google Cloud）合作伙伴为整个技术栈构建了强大的防火墙。对于中小型公司来说，应对网络安全快速发展带来的挑战非常困难，因此，将数据和系统安全交给大型科技公司处理，是选择云服务的另一个重要原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you um work with data privacy and cyber security? I mean it's totally key. I mean that would probably one of the worst things that that could happen if you got some malware really integrated into your systems. Yeah. And I mean it's part of of all of our contracts with the customers. they have clear SLAs on you know on what happens in case there are vulnerabilities. We of course invest you know billions of R&D money into cyber I mean it's actually for us a corporate requirement and there are clear also SLAs and requirements inside SAP so we take this very serious we have the even you know in the board regular checkups so that the organization feels there's no compromise around cyber security but what I always tell my customers about is when you look at SAP or our hyperscala partners I mean we are putting a a big firewall around the whole technical stack. I mean as a midsize company somewhere here in Germany or in Europe or everywhere in the world. I mean it's hard to deal you know with this you know fast developments on cyber. So I would say the cloud is another good reason now to say for cyber I want to move to the cloud. I give this you know topic also in the hands of big technology companies to secure my data to secure my system.</p>
</details>

随着一切数字化，攻击面越来越大，新的威胁也在增加。Christian Klein强调，B2B数据，尤其是在某些行业，是极其关键的，因此必须确保有一个安全的运行环境。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just seems like the attack surface is getting bigger and bigger as everything is digitalized, right? And you and you have new type of enemies. Yeah, you have a new you know bad actors. You you actually the threats are increasing. I mean we see it clearly. I mean you know and that is you know the B2B data especially in some industries is is very mission critical. So yes you you have to absolutely make sure that you have a secure landscape up and running.</p>
</details>

Nikolai Tangen问，既然Amazon发明了云计算，为什么SAP没有？Christian Klein承认这是一个好问题。他表示，SAP现在在云领域非常成功，增长速度在SaaS领域名列前茅。但他承认，15-20年前SAP未能预见这一点。他提到了“**创新者困境**”（The Invader's Dilemma: 指企业在面对颠覆性创新时，往往因为专注于现有成功业务而难以适应新变化）这本书，认为其中有很多真理。当一个传统业务模式运行良好，带来可观增长和利润时，很难意识到市场变化的速度，更难说服客户、员工甚至资本市场去颠覆自己的业务模式，并行构建一个可能耗费巨资的新业务模式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now if you look at history u Amazon uh kind of invented cloud computing. Why why wasn't it SAP? Yeah, Nikolai, that's a good question. I mean, um, look, the good piece is now you see it in our numbers. We are there, we are super successful. I would say we have the fastest grows in the SAS space. But the point is, of course, you know, why didn't we see it, you know, 15, 20 years ago. I mean, there's a a good book about the invaders dilemma. I said there's a lot of truth into it. Yeah. You have a well-run traditional business model. it delivers good quotes growth, good profits and and you don't realize hey how fast can the market change actually and then to to tell you know your customers to tell your employees and even you know worse sometimes to tell the capital markets to say hey I going to disrupt my own business module and I'm you know building now a diff different business model in parallel which costs probably a lot of money you know it's not that easy.</p>
</details>

Christian Klein表示，早在SAP收购大量云产品时，他就清楚市场正在变化，他个人一直认为SAP需要更大力度地押注云。因此，在2019年他成为公司联席CEO时，他明确表示必须加倍投入云转型。他指出，SAP拥有5万名开发者，每天都在编写出色的代码，包括许多AI用例。但如果客户还在使用8年前的版本，创新差距就会太大。SAP正在为业务模式转型、供应链韧性、绿色账本（用于精确计算碳排放）等开发大量新功能，而缩小这种创新差距的解决方案就是云。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For a moment where you realized you needed to change. I mean for me I mean it was pretty clear already when we acquired a lot of you know cloud products. It was clear that the market is is changing and for me I mean personally I always thought hey we need to bet even more on the cloud. I mean you see you know where the customers is going and and so it was for me very clear in 2019 when I became the co-CEO of the company that we have to double down on our cloud transformation. Absolutely. I mean nicolai we are have 50,000 developers they are coding great stuff every day a lot of AI use cases are really good stuff but what does it help when you are sitting on an 8-year-old release and you're looking into a screen which is you know probably you know still touched you know by one of our founders yeah so that is that that is the problem yeah the innovation gap is too big and we are coding a lot of new capabilities for business model transformation resiliency in supply chain we have a green ledger you know You can use a queen ledger to not only guessing about carbon emissions but also having actuals and you need to reduce this this gap. Yeah. You between you know the customers say here the latest release is there and and the answer and the solution to that is cloud.</p>
</details>

他承认，这是一个艰难的决定，因为转型可能会影响股价。他回忆说，SAP在2007-2008年曾拥有一个名为SAP Hosting的100%控股公司，当时有人意识到客户可能希望将IT系统外包到云端。但后来SAP将其出售了，因为云业务的利润率不如传统业务高，短期内对季度业绩没有帮助。然而，SAP最终还是鼓起勇气，向资本市场宣布将投资新的业务模式。过去四年，SAP内部也发生了巨大的变化，包括员工工作方式、激励机制和衡量成功的方式。他强调，制定战略容易，但执行战略往往是最大的挑战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure. But it's a tough decision to make right because you do kind of you take a hit on when it comes to the share price and all that kind of things right. Yeah. I mean look I mean SAP had in 20078 we had a company you know 100% owned SAP SAP hosting so some people here somewhere you know realized there is something coming maybe customers want to outsource their IT systems to the cloud and then we sold it what I figured out later is you know the margin was not that high as in our traditional business it was actually you know not helping quarter by quarter but then you know to the courage to say you know what we go out to the capital markets and say you know we have our traditional business so to say more our cash cow and then plus but we invest into a new business model I mean that is of course never easy and then look at SEP the last four years when you would ask now the people here there's a lot of change also in the way how they work day day over day the way how we incentivize them the way how we measure success I mean everything is changing it's a nice piece of strategy paper but then to get the strategy executed is you know often times yeah the biggest challenge.</p>
</details>

### 量子计算与软件生产力

Christian Klein认为，**量子计算**（quantum computing: 利用量子力学原理进行计算的新型计算模式）将对SAP的工作方式产生深远影响。例如，在供应链领域，物流优化是一个极其复杂的问题，需要大量的计算能力来模拟物流链。这涉及到数百万个影响物流供应链的价值驱动因素。他认为，如果能将量子计算应用于SAP的供应链产品组合中，那将是一个巨大的变革。在金融和区块链领域，量子计算也有早期应用案例。SAP的研究人员预计，在三到四年内，这项技术将足够成熟，可以在其产品组合中实际应用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you think quantum computing will change the way you work? um quantum I mean definitely we're doing a research that for example take supply chain yeah when it comes about logistics optimization yeah it's very very complex you need a lot of computing power yeah to to simulate you know logistical chains you know how to bring a product A from product B there millions of you know value drivers who influence your logistical supply chain and that is of course you know one use case where we definitely see it will be a big gamecher if we can you know use quantum yeah in the case of in the context of our supply chain portfolio finance blockchain is of course you know one another thing um but you know these are the the early use cases and you know when I'm talking to our researchers they actually would say now in three to four years I mean the the technology should be that mature that we really can apply it in the context of our portfolio of our products.</p>
</details>

当被问及过去软件为何未能带来更多生产力时，Christian Klein回忆起在成为CEO之前，他负责IT组织时，曾有人提出一个将系统迁移到**S/4HANA**（SAP的下一代ERP套件）的商业案例。但这个案例纯粹是技术迁移，没有明确说明对业务转型有何益处。他认为，客户在运行ERP或AI项目时，必须让业务部门参与进来。如果一个ERP项目讨论只有IT人员在场，那么客户可能无法获得最大价值。虽然降低系统运行成本（**TCO**，Total Cost of Ownership: 总拥有成本）也是一个好处，但更重要的是将技术与业务连接起来。许多公司在如何整合业务方面面临挑战，业务部门是否愿意接受自动化和标准化，或者每个人是否都可以在商品业务中随心所欲，这往往是软件项目中的难题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why haven't companies gotten more productivity out of software in the past yeah that's a good piece. I mean when I before I became the the CEO um I asked of course I was running here the IT organization and I got presented a business case I moved to S forana I said oh great idea but what does it do to our business what does it do our transformation but it was purely planned as a technical migration oh there's a next ERP let's just technically migrate I said what is now you know changing for the benefit of our SAS module I mean we won the company still as a onremise company in many business processes. So for me I guess it's very important that the customers understand when you are running an ERP project or let's take AI you always have to have the business at the table when you're coming in here and you talk about ERP and there are only IT people around the around the table I would question will the customers see the the maximum value of course it can benefit of decreasing the cost of running such a system there is of course also a TCO game in that but it's very very important that you connect you know the technology with the business and this is where companies struggle the most with how to do it, how to integrate the business. Is the business really open for that kind of change? Is the business open for automation for standardization or is you know actually has everyone the freedom to do whatever they want in a in a in a commodity business. That is often times the challenges in such software projects.</p>
</details>

### AI的变革性影响

谈到AI，Christian Klein最兴奋的是它带来的可能性和机遇。他以一家法国零售商为例，该公司每天处理数百万个订单变更。通过AI自动化这些流程，可以极大地提高生产力。他认为，未来三到五年内，AI在SAP领域最大的变革将发生在分析空间。AI和算法将能够整合业务数据和大量其他内容，从而将财务规划、供应链规划和劳动力规划提升到全新的智能水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's move to AI. Um, what excites you the most with AI? The possibilities, the opportunities, what you can do with this technology. I mean, I see it always in the context of our customers business. And I just had, you know, yesterday a big, you know, French retailer here and they do millions of changes to orders. Yeah. They change orders every day because consumers, you know, actually, you know, do a change of what they order. They do a lot of order changes in the supply in the supplier space. And now when you can see how you can automate that. Yeah, with AI I mean for them it's like a big productivity booster. So if you if you look at the possibilities here uh and so from if you were to try to rank them what are kind of the most amazing things you're seeing here starting from the biggest the biggest changes over the next three to five years the biggest changes is actually in the context of SAP and AI is definitely on the analytic space. I mean you you today you going to figure out you know your own planning simulations. you're figuring out how does my supply chain planning work in context with the demand which is coming and when you see now how AI and all these algorithms will work and now you can not only bring business data in but also a lot of other content in I mean that makes of course you know financial planning supply chain planning workforce planning I mean will be absolutely moved to a completely different level uh so in the work of intelligence the way how these plans are integrated and of course how you then at the end can optimize and run your business.</p>
</details>

另一个例子是资产管理。许多客户在资产管理上投入数十亿美元，而预测性维护将受到**生成式AI**（generative AI: 能够生成文本、图像等新内容的AI模型）和传统AI的巨大影响，从而提高机器和工厂的正常运行时间，进一步提升公司生产力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Or take another example on the supply chain side. I mean a lot of our customers spend billions of of dollars on asset management. Yeah. So predictive maintenance for assets is something which will be of course hugely impacted by generative AI but also traditional AI. So that is definitely an area for uptime of machines, uptime of factories. I mean it's absolutely a big potential there with AI. Yeah. To actually drive further productivity for a company. So these are some of the use cases we are driving on and then talking about you know the stuff which is coming now on a chendic I mean how often did I sit in front of an SAP system you know analyzing you know our the payments over to you and then you put the finance data out oh over to you and then what is actually the problem of this customer why why is the customer not paying then you can talk to sales you can talk to logistics you can have maybe a commercial issue and when you look now at Chantic AI you can actually tell the system, you know what, give me all payments overdue, the top 20 or top 100, but then not only give me this report, give me why is what is the root cause? Why is this customer not paying? Is there an sales issue? Is there a logistical issue? Did we deliver too late? Or is it a commercial issue? And then when you think about that, you know, what kind of answer do you get back? And recommendations about what kind of actions you should actually take. I mean, this is remarkable.</p>
</details>

Christian Klein还提到了**代理式AI**（agentic AI: 能够自主执行任务、与环境交互并学习的AI系统）。他举例说，过去需要人工分析逾期付款、找出根本原因（是销售问题、物流问题还是商业问题），现在通过代理式AI，可以直接询问系统，它不仅能提供报告，还能分析根本原因并给出行动建议。他认为，目前许多人在这方面花费大量时间，但可能无法总是找到最佳行动方案，而代理式AI将能做到这一点。SAP正在开发财务代理、物流代理、供应链代理等，它们将相互协作，拥有更多数据来提供洞察。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean there you know actually today a lot of humans being not only spend time but probably not always figuring out a wide you know call to action and that is now what agendic will do. There's a finance agent, there's a logistical agent, there's a supply chain agent and they will collaborate with each other and they have so much more data you know in the you know in their mind in their when will you have a true identic AI where actually the first one we already shipped that is about you know the services and the services agents we have yeah when you're sitting in a in a call center and you need to give advice uh to a customer about are the assets you know actually available what is the issue of an asset that is already shipped and Now we will launch at Sapphire we will launch 10 more agent agentic AI use cases and I mean is the big exhibition. Yes exactly which is coming in May.</p>
</details>

SAP已经推出了第一个代理式AI用例，用于服务代理，例如呼叫中心员工可以获得关于资产可用性和问题诊断的建议。在即将到来的Sapphire大会上，SAP将推出10个新的代理式AI用例。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah on average across your client base how much do you think this can drive productivity? I mean our promise to our clients this year will be every end user who's working with our AI so our digital assistant tool with the embedded I use cases yeah we can actually drive productivity up to by 30%. 30%. Yeah, I mean what across the whole company or you have to it's not only a marketing claim. No, but is that just for this function or is it across the company? It's actually across the company. Yeah. When you are touching SAP software what are the big what are the big things this year which are going to drive 30% productivity gain.</p>
</details>

Christian Klein承诺，今年使用SAP AI数字助理工具的每个最终用户，其生产力可以提高高达30%。他强调这不是营销口号，而是针对整个公司的生产力提升。他举例说，在人力资源领域，AI代理可以帮助HR业务伙伴招聘和留住人才，识别技能差距，制定培训计划和目标设定。虽然HR业务伙伴仍需确认，但AI代理可以代劳繁琐的搜索和输入工作。在财务规划与分析（**FP&A**）领域，财务和销售代理可以帮助进行财务模拟、预测销售管道对营收的影响等。

<p class="english-text">I mean it really depends on you know you can take HR take HR. Yeah. You actually when you're an HR business partner you you you need to hire you need to retain you need to hire the right skills you need to retain the right people. You actually need to bring make sure that the learnings are connected yeah to the skills of the people. What what are the learning gaps and that is you know somewhat something what an HR agent will do for you. Job postings done based on you know a lot of insights where is the skill gap in the company what kind of skills do I need? when you then put trainings together or goal setting that will be taken over by HR agent. Obviously an HR business partner will have to say yes that is the wide learning journey for this kind of job profile but at the end you know in in the past they had to type they had to search what is the wide learnings for them. Now an HR agent is doing this for them and then they can confirm it if if it fits you know to their expectations. In finance when you are in FPNA I mean you put a lot of data out of BW you're doing financial simulations how you going to end the year what is the sales pipeline how can it influence my topline I mean there is a finance and a sales agent now doing this for you.</p>
</details>

当被问及代理式AI何时能好到不再需要SAP时，Christian Klein认为，最终仍然需要商业软件。他表示，尽管有人讨论AI普及后SaaS是否仍有价值，但他坚信SaaS仍然至关重要，因为每个AI用例都需要数据和业务上下文。他无法想象如何在没有SAP应用的情况下，在业务上下文中提供AI。**大型语言模型**（LLMs: Large Language Models，指参数量巨大、通过海量文本数据训练的深度学习模型）可以处理非结构化内容和语音转文本，但真正让SAP与众不同的是其AI基础，它能理解业务、业务流程和业务数据。全球没有任何一个大型语言模型能理解业务数据、访问业务数据并理解业务上下文。

<p class="english-text">When is uh aentic AI going to be so good that we don't need SAP actually I mean I would say um you know at the end you need business software I mean when you look at you And I know there was a lot of talk about you know is SAS still relevant when AI is broadcasting. I would say SAS is value relevant because at the end every AI use case needs data needs the business context. I mean sorry to say I have no imagination maybe someone out there has how we could deliver our AI in the context of the business without our apps. I need a business context. I need a context of the business process. I need a semantical data structure of the customer. I mean it's not like you know that you can just implement an large language model from any kind of render uh and then say okay I'm now having you know AI working for my business. No large language model on this globe understands business data has access to business data understands the business context and that's why we are saying yes we use the LLMs for the unstructured content for you know actually for speech to text but at the end what it really is the differentiator for us is our AI foundation who understands the businesses the business processes and the business data.</p>
</details>

Christian Klein表示，SAP的目标是为客户提供更多价值。如果客户获得更多价值，他们就会更依赖SAP软件来运行业务。SAP希望缩短和消除软件实施所需的时间。当被问及他工作中哪些部分比较枯燥时，他认为仍然需要人类做出决策，例如他需要出差拜访客户、合作伙伴和投资者，这是人类必须做的事情。但许多准备工作，例如为财报会议或大会做准备，将高度自动化。他个人最期待的是不再需要手动输入大量交易来获取系统信息。他作为SAP软件的最终用户，正在使用**Jewel**（SAP的AI数字助理）等AI工具，亲身体验生产力的提升。例如，他现在只需点击鼠标或与Jewel对话，就能获取季度**损益表**（P&L，Profit & Loss: 利润与损失）报告，甚至获得当前云积压等预测，这比过去更加智能和自动化。

<p class="english-text">So when we have made this new great uh genetic AI Mhm. And we are putting this model in charge of running SAP. Uh what part is it that you would be happy to see go and what part would you absolutely keep yourself? Um I mean first I mean obviously I mean our overarching goal is to deliver more value. If the customer delivers more value I have a belief they will rely more on SAP software to run their business. And obviously what we want to shrink and reduce and remove is the time to implement the software. Yeah. The time what part what part of your job do you think is a bit dull? My job. Yeah. I mean look at the end of the day I mean I I still believe there are human beings who are making decisions. Yeah. Who will you know I mean I'm traveling the world. I'm visiting customers, partners, investors. And I still believe that is you know something what human beings and my co has to do. But what will be of course you know much less is when I'm getting prepped for my earnings when I'm getting prepped you know for a conference etc. I mean a lot of that will be highly automated. So what is it that you look forward to not doing in this year? Me personally yeah I mean what I'm not doing is in in the past you know I'm still know our products. I still know our solutions. So sometimes I go in and look into goals. I look into learnings. I look into financial numbers. So I'm able to really access our finance solutions still and in what I'm not doing anymore is typing in a lot of transactions uh to get the information I would like to get out of our system. So I'm an end user of SAP software as well and that is of course I'm using jewel I'm using a lot of AI and I see you know by myself how I also will get more productive. Yeah, just this morning I looked into our P&L. I cannot talk about our earnings, but I wanted to see where we stand and when I looked at how I did it in the past and how I'm doing it today. I'm not only getting a P&L report with one mouse click or actually with one, you know, talking to Jewel, please give me my Q1 P&L. I can also say give me a prediction about, you know, what is our current cloud backloings we did, etc. So that is, you know, of course, more intelligent and way more automated. Yeah, also for me as a CEO now.</p>

### 公共部门的数字化转型与欧洲挑战

Christian Klein指出，在德国或法国等欧洲国家，公共部门已经普遍接受云和AI，他们看到了数字化公民服务带来的好处。然而，公共部门面临更多监管，对数据处理有非常明确的**主权云**要求。因此，SAP正在与Capgemini、Microsoft等合作伙伴在德国和法国等地投资建设主权云，以帮助政府和公共部门机构在云端运行其业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh many private companies are uh doing well here. What about governments and public sectors across Europe for instance? Yeah. What's this what's the what's the scope here? Yeah. I mean you know when you look at Germany or France I mean there is not a question anymore should we go cloud they all convinced about cloud. They all want to use AI. they see you know also for the citizens the all the citizen services you know you can actually digitize a lot and you can actually make this also m make the citizens more happy with embedded AI now they of course have way more regulations on you know what what what does happen with the data they have you know clear very clear sovereign cloud requirements and so we investing yeah we have deos here in Germany we have in in France we have together with cup gemini Microsoft we have blue so we They're building these sovereign clouds to also then say hey but now you know every government every public sector agency can also then you know do business and run their business with SAP in the cloud.</p>
</details>

他观察到，公共部门在合理化方面有时会显得犹豫。他们通常更厌恶风险，因为数字化一个机构会影响成千上万的最终用户，一旦出错就会受到批评。但如果一切顺利，通常没有人会谈论。这使得政府和政治家在做决策时变得谨慎，因为维持现状就不会受到批评，但代价是保持官僚化和手动化。尽管公共部门的数字化正在推进，但他们显然不是这方面的先行者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is there a real willingness amongst public sector to rationalize? Yeah, look, I mean sometimes I see there's some, you know, um, of course they they are a bit more risk averse. Um, and of course, you know, when you want to digitize a certain agency, you are touching, you know, usually thousands of end users and when something goes wrong, you get criticized. The problem here is when everything goes right, usually no one talks about that. And then you know sometimes I see you know governments you know politicians getting a little bit shy or whisker worse to make those decisions just you know because when you stay on the status quo everything stays like it is and I cannot get criticized the problem is every stays everything also stays very bureaucratic very manual so but we see now that it's moving but clearly the public sector is definitely not a front runner when it comes to digitization. Yeah. No no I mean the safest way not to make mistakes is not to do anything right.</p>
</details>

Christian Klein展望未来十年，认为人们将能更专注于制定战略和行业转型，而不是沉溺于数据分析等工作，因为这些将由AI和软件完成。在财务和人力资源领域，许多手动交易、文件筛选和官僚程序将被自动化取代，使HR业务伙伴能够更多地思考未来五年的劳动力需求和技能变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is work going to look like in 10 years time? In 10 years time um look I I really believe that um when you when you look at no matter in a company which function you want to take I would say people can be way more focused on you know on building great strategy how is my industry transforming but really not so much into anymore you know going into you know data analytics etc. I mean there will be a lot you know what will be done by AI or software to really supplement you know your strategy work way more and the same is true for you know as I said before on finance or HR there's still today a lot of you know manual transactions documents which you need to screen a lot of bureaucracy you you have to deal with and I'm totally convinced a lot of that will be taken out and will allow HR business partner to think more about hey what is the the workforce I need in 5 years from now, how will my skills change? And a lot will be done, you know, in the back by software and AI.</p>
</details>

他提到，机器人和**人形机器人**（humanoids: 具有人类外形特征的机器人）的影响已经显现。他曾在中国和其他地方的仓库中看到95%的工作由机器人完成。工厂和机器的维护也将完全由AI和机器人自动化。这意味着劳动力构成将发生变化，即使在SAP内部，开发者在五年后的技能画像也会大不相同。因此，每家公司都必须思考劳动力如何进行技能转型，以及未来需要哪些工作岗位，哪些将不再需要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What about the situation with humanoids and and robots? So, I I met this um robotic company uh earlier in the week. I'm just amazed by how soon they will be all over the place. Yeah. What how is this going to impact society? I mean, the impact is there already today. I mean I have seen warehouses in China and other places in the world where 95% of the work in a warehouse is done by robots and I mean that is already you know today changing and that will continue I mean also the way how you maintain factories how you maintain machines will be completely automated also by AI not only robots and so your workforce will change I mean even at SAP look at SAP I mean we actually have today a profile of a developer so we will still have many developers also in 5 years from now but the skill profile of a developer will change a lot. Yeah. So the way how we code the way how we will deliver software will radically change. So it's very important for every company to also think about okay this is my workforce here and today but also how does my workforce need to transform skill-wise and what kind of jobs do I need and which kind of jobs will will do I won't need anymore in the future.</p>
</details>

关于欧洲的竞争力，Christian Klein认为欧洲仍有许多优势，但目前竞争力不足。他指出，德国经济正在受苦，而欧洲作为一个整体，因为未能形成真正的联盟，正在失去许多趋势。无论是银行业联盟、数字化还是基础设施，都需要一个共同市场。与美国和中国相比，欧洲未能整合力量，导致在IT、科技、银行、零售等领域的竞争力下降。他认为，欧洲的“联盟”并非真正的联盟，这必须改变，而且监管过多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Europe how is Europe doing? Yeah, I mean I I mean look I would say still Europe has a lot of strengths but you know these days I would say Europe is not very competitive. I mean you see I mean look at Germany our economy is clearly suffering other economies are doing still better but I would say Europe is you know losing a lot of trends just not being by being not a union. Yeah, at the end of the day we you know you need a market a common market for banking union for digitization for for infrastructure and and and the point is yeah when you look at the US when you look at China I mean when you bundle your power you know you also then you know have better chances yeah when it comes to competition not only in IT or tech it's also about banking it's about retail etc and this is something where I feel the union is just not a union and that in my eyes clearly has to change and there's too much regulation.</p>
</details>

他举例说，欧洲有《AI法案》来规范AI，但德国还有自己的数据保护条款。这意味着在欧盟层面有一个新法案，但在成员国层面仍然有不同的法案，这层层叠加的官僚主义非但没有减少，反而增加了，使得在欧洲做生意变得更加困难。这意味着签署合同需要更多的律师，他们不仅要懂当地法律，还要懂欧洲法律。他指出，过去两年SAP在欧洲的法务部门规模翻了一番，仅商业合同合规检查就需要约150人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean you know tell tell me about digital information act. The digital information. Yeah. The point is yeah I mean we are not against for example the AI act. I guess AI clearly needs a framework for regulation. The point is only you have the AI act on Europe but you still have the den in Germany. Yeah. So another you know clause around where you where it's defined how data needs to be protected you know how do we deal with consumer data and so you know you have a new act on EU level but you still have you know different you know acts also then on in the member states and then you're adding one layer on top of another layer and that is of course not contributing you know to reduce bureaucracy you're adding more bureaucracy and that makes also that the ease of doing business is getting harder not easier and that is the kind of problem what we have in what are the implications the the implication when you sign a contract today around you know with with a European company and you embed AI into into the solution and then finally into a commercial contract. I mean you have you need way more lawyers. Yeah. You need a lot of lawyers. You need lawyers who understand local law but then you need lawyers understanding European law. And that just shows I guess very well you know the the the the difficulty of doing business in in in Europe and when you are signing a contract in the US you know there's first of all much less regulation but there are not different regulations state by state and I mean Nikolai we here in Europe in the last two years we had to double the size you know of our of our legal department just to how big is your legal department now here in in Europe I I have to check but it's probably around you know 150 people only for commercial for contract you know compliance checks are we compliant is everything in the contract right and of course customers have a lot of questions around how do we do AI can help you with that eventually yeah actually you you are actually saying something which is also very true when you see we do all the refract checks is done by AI first there's still a revenue accountant who is then looking at the contract finally but there is a lot of refract checks compliance checks which we are doing with AI still you get every time new regulation so the bureaucracy is also increasing.</p>
</details>

尽管SAP也使用AI进行合同合规检查，但新的法规不断涌现，官僚主义仍在增加。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Related question why are there so few tech companies in Europe I mean my big belief is when I think the number is what three out of the top 50 in the world and you're the number one that's why that's right I mean look it's of course about you know I mean you know this better than I do about you know is there enough people funds and willing to take some risk and you know and fund you know some early startups but I would say money is not um the main issue we're having here in Europe.</p>
</details>

Christian Klein认为欧洲科技公司稀少的原因并非主要是资金问题。他以SAP的创始人为例，他们有勇气放弃高薪工作创办公司，克服了银行的多次拒绝，最终成功执行了他们的想法，甚至冒险进入美国市场。他认为，硅谷的成功在于将优秀的研究、大学和公司结合起来，形成了一个生态系统，能够早期发现技术趋势，并将其与现实世界的问题结合起来。再加上愿意为初创企业提供资金以实现规模化的人，共同造就了硅谷的独特之处。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean take for example SAP there was actually you know five people who did a job and they found hey I'm doing the same task all over again and they had first of all the courage to say you know I'm going out of a well- paid job and I found SAP then they had to find you know people who finance them. That wasn't by far not easy. They got a lot of, you know, nos from many banks here in the region. And then last but not least, they had an idea, but then also they had to execute. So they had the courage once again not only to do business here in Germany, but they also then risked, you know, to to go to the US and in other places in the world. And so when I look at this today and why is this happening so often in the US and not in Germany when you look at in the Silicon Valley and uh I mean there's often a talk why are there so many you know successful tech companies in this in the Silicon Valley I see there is a piece there is great research there are great universities but there are also great companies and you know when you see this in combination you have great tech new tech coming you see it you see it very early especially in the Silicon Valley there are a lot smart people figuring out where is the technology going to, what are the techn technological trends but then you also have real world problems and when you then bring this together business research and universities this is you know where great ideas you know are born and then you of course have to have the money to execute and have to have people who are willing to finance you know this new idea this startup yeah to scale and that is of course also the ecosystem there which makes it very very special and here in Europe I mean look at that.</p>
</details>

在欧洲，如果一家初创公司在德国成立，市场规模有限。如果想在法国、比利时或挪威等其他国家开展业务，则面临不同的法规，需要建立不同的法律实体，这耗费时间和金钱。因此，许多初创公司选择去美国发展。

<details>

<p class="english-text">If you build now a startup in Germany, I mean you have a certain size of a market but then when you want to do business in France or in Belgium or another or Norway, you know there are different regulations. You actually have to build a different legal entity and that is time and money what it costs you and that is not good. Yeah. And that that's why I would say there are a lot of good reasons to then to go to the US and found your startup there before you doing it in Europe. Absolutely.</p>
</details>

### 领导力、企业文化与个人成长

面对如此艰难的背景，Christian Klein认为SAP成功的秘诀首先是五位拥有伟大想法的创始人，其次是始终有勇气进行转型。SAP历史上多次面临需要颠覆自身业务模式和技术的情况，如果当时没有这种意愿，SAP可能早已成为“昨日黄花”。因此，持续转型和颠覆传统业务模式的意愿至关重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So against this really difficult backdrop which you just painted. Yes. If you were to distill down why has SAP been so successful? I would say first of all five founders who had a great idea and second to always have the courage to transform. I mean there were many many situations in SEP's history when you know the CEOs or back then the founders wouldn't have you know the willingness to disrupt their own business model their own technology. SAP would have been yesterday's company. So it's also about this constant transformation, this willingness to disrupt your own traditional business model and to move on.</p>
</details>

Christian Klein在40岁之前就成为了CEO，他认为这是SAP的优势所在。他从学生时代加入SAP，一直得到导师的指导，获得了知识、平台、信任和责任。他26、27岁时就带领了第一个七人团队。SAP内部有一个大型的内部人才市场，员工有机会轮岗，了解业务的不同部分，这帮助他全面学习了业务。他在SuccessFactors（SAP收购的一家公司）的工作经历，让他从交易、营销到软件交付和客户采纳，全面了解了公司运营。这些实践经验比大学课程更有价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moving on to leadership. So you um became the CEO before you turned 40. It's quite extraordinary. How was that? I mean I look at my career at SAP and I feel this is the strength of SAP. I mean I started here as a student. Um and um and since then I always had first of all people mentors who actually you know gave me a lot of knowledge who actually gave me a platform to quot my career and they gave me a lot of trust and responsibility. I had my first team here at SEP with seven people when I was you know 26 27 others are still at the university and then you know I had the the opportunity not to only see one part of SAP. I mean we have here a big internal job market. So the the ability to rotate and seeing different parts of the business is absolutely there and that helped me a lot to not only have great mentors but also then to learn business end to end and then look at my time at success factors. I was moving from here to um San Mateo in in San Francisco and I was able to help last back in the days to one success factors end to end. I mean I learned so much yeah from you know closing deals doing marketing into delivering software and also then making sure the customers are adopting the software and that was for me of course you know better than every you know learning course at the university I saw real life how such a company has to work and then of course with my career you know really seeing different parts of the company when I'm sitting here today as a CEO I see sometimes green lights you know in certain meetings and I can still judge hm Is this maybe too green or should this not be more orange? And I don't like orange. So, let's go to wet. It's green or wet. We have a problem or not? And and so I have, I guess, the ability to charge, of course, not always to the deepest level, but I have the ability to judge, you know, are we going in the right direction and are the pieces really fitting together so that it works end to end.</p>
</details>

当被问及如何领导比自己年长许多的员工时，Christian Klein表示他从未过多考虑年龄。他总是通过知识、专业知识和帮助他人更好地完成工作来赢得人们的信任。他认为，当人们感受到有人理解业务，并能帮助他们在职业生涯中进步时，年龄就不再重要。SAP的企业文化也强调绩效和团队合作，而非年龄。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How um was it to lead uh people who were a lot older than you when you were so young? Actually, I didn't think so much about it. I always, you know, wanted to convince people about, you know, leadership, about making decisions. Um, also convince them about, you know, with knowledge and expertise and and also, you know, always, you know, be there to also help them. Yeah. To do that job better. And I guess when people feel that there is someone who understands the business who is also helping me you know in my own career helping me you know to move on I guess then you also you know create you know the acceptance you need and then I guess age doesn't matter so much and here at SAP I would say we also have that kind of culture that it's not a matter of age it's really about you know your own performance but also the way how you adhere to our values and be able to work in a team because here everything you know once in projects. There are not so many job profiles here at SAP where you do where you are an individual contributor. A lot of is happening in teams in projects.</p>
</details>

他提到了几位重要的导师：早期提拔他的领导；长期董事会成员G. Oswald，他教会Christian Klein要专注于客户和产品，理解软件的关键任务性；SuccessFactors的创始人Lars Dalgaard；以及负责开发的Jim Hagemann Snabe，他教会Christian Klein如何将业务与技术结合。Christian Klein职业生涯中最重要的时刻是Bill McDermott邀请他担任首席运营官（COO）。当时，此前四位COO都失败了，Christian Klein告诉Bill，他不希望成为第五个失败者，他需要业务、业务流程和数据，否则影响力会大打折扣。Bill给了他这个机会，让他学会了转型一家公司是多么困难，这不仅仅是技术问题。这也是他现在告诉客户的，SAP不仅是实施新技术或ERP，更要成为客户业务转型的一部分，这样技术才能发挥巨大价值。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Who have been your important mentors? I mean uh early in the days I mean there was of course uh the the person who hired me who gave me you know um you know a great platform to to learn but then also to said at one day he said hey why don't you go to this executive board member and present your stuff by yourself and not me presenting it you know go there and I give you the platform you know to really show how how good you are and what kind of work you're doing and that helped a lot and then I was of Of course with G Oswald, he was a long-standing board member here. He teached me a lot about, you know, not so much care about so much internal stuff, but really focus on customers. He was responsible for service and support. So I learned it the hard way also how missionritical our software is. And he always told me, Christian, no matter if you're in finance and service and support, always understand our products and our customers business. Then I had last Algard um you know as um you know CEO of success factor who founded this beautiful company. I had Jim Sna completely different personality. He was running development. So I was running deaf operations for him. So I learned a lot about you know how to connect business with technology was very important. And then I guess the most important time in my career was when Bill McDermad asked me to become the chief operating officer. And because um four CEOs before all failed and I said to Bill, you know, Bill, I don't want to be the fifth one failing here. I want to still build a great career at SAP. Can you do me a favor? Um it is great, but I need businesses. I need business processes and I need data. Otherwise, you know, it is can only be, you know, less impactful, but I need, you know, the business systems and data. And so he gave me also then you know this opportunity to become the chief operating officer and there you know I learned how hard it is to transform a company. It's not only about tech and that's what I'm also now telling our customers today as a CEO. I said hey SAP can be way more for you than only implementing a new tech a new solution a new ERP. We need to be part of your business transformation because then the tech can unfold immense value. AI can unfold immense value.</p>

当Christian Klein遇到大问题时，他会向执行董事会同事寻求建议，例如战略主管Sebastian Steinhaeuser。在公司外部，他仍然与前导师Lars Dalgaard保持良好关系，并有一些教练帮助他处理复杂问题。他还与微软的Satya Nadella和Adobe的Shantanu Narayen等业界领袖交流业务。他特别提到，在38岁成为CEO之初，他经常向他们寻求建议。他欣赏Satya和Shantanu对业务的深刻理解、创造性思维和谦逊态度。

<p class="english-text">You can buy a yacht or a lot of AI. You have a big problem now. Who do you approach? Who do you ask? Actually when I have a big problem now I mean I have my executive board colleagues and which I trust a lot and you know many of them I really ask for an advice be you know Sebastian Stein as head of strategy is now our CEO. I go to him and then we have a cup of coffee and think about you know the strategy strategy to execution what does work well what does not work so well and then the same is with with my other all all other bot colleagues I'm the one who and what about outside the company who do you outside of the company I would still say I have a good relationship still to last you know a former mentor I have um you know a lot of coaches who also help me on you know how to deal with complex topics how to do problem solving etc so I have a few people there and then of course you know when you talk to Saja Nadella when you talk to Shondanu from Adobe etc. I mean we talk about business just doing a little plug here we have had them both on the on the podcast so so the listeners should especially when I became you know I was 38 when I became the CEO I mean often times I at where we especially at the beginning I asked them for advice I said they are they are both uh Indian is there something with the Indian leadership that you admire or try to replicate? M look I mean what I see in both of these gentlemen I see that Satya and Chandanu first of all understand the business inside out Satya also started his career at Microsoft very early and when I talk to him I mean he understands you know product commercials where's the market going to he has a super creative mindset on how to bring all of these pieces together but they're also quite humble right they're also quite humble yes indeed and I would actually say this is also very important As I also tell the people here, I mean it's great about the share price but at the end you know next day you have to deserve you know the the white to actually you know serve your customers better and that is you know at the end this humbleness what you need to not only become successful but also to stay successful.</p>

关于德国的领导风格，Christian Klein认为德国人注重流程和法规。他个人有时会努力减少官僚主义。他认为，这种对细节的关注在组织供应链和制造方面是优势，但过度监管可能成为最大的弱点。

<p class="english-text">Is there such a thing as a German leadership style? Um I would say you know the Germans when I look at the German leadership style I mean we have our processes we have regulations. Am I now a typical German? I mean I sometimes you know try to ask to get bureaucracy out. Yeah. But I see this as a typical German thing which is on one thing as strengths. Yeah. when it comes to you know organizing supply chain one supply chain one manufacturing you need to have this you know kind of passion for the details but you also need to be careful that you are not overregulating so much yeah there is there is somewhere a borderline which you shouldn't cross because then your strengths can also become your biggest weakness.</p>

Christian Klein从担任Adidas董事会成员中学到，CEO需要贴近零售商和供应链运营人员，而不是高高在上。此外，营销和品牌热度在不同行业中都很重要。他还从Adidas的经验中获得了关于如何构建弹性供应链以及技术如何提供帮助的宝贵见解。

<p class="english-text">What have you learned from being on the board of Adidas with our fellow Norwegian oh yes yes yes um he's also a humble guy And uh what I what I when I look at Bern I mean he he wants to be close to his retailers. He wants to be close to the people wanting the supply chain. And I guess that is what a CEO is also about to not sit at the top in your ivory tower and you know see this is my strategy and uh so but really coming down and say hey what are the needs you know of my different stakeholders and then act based on those. And then the second based on Adidas it's a different industry but of course you know marketing brand heat you know matters a lot and that is of course certain things what I can also take out for for SAP despite we are different industry supply chains co it was very interesting how adidas build a very resilient supply chain and how can tech can help so out of this mandate I also take a lot of you know input for our technology on to how to help you know such companies to one even better with our technology because you are sitting in the board and you see you know what is working well and where do they need help.</p>

关于执行力，Christian Klein认为自己有时可能过于急躁，决策过快。但他更倾向于每天做出10个决策，即使其中两个是错的，他也会承认并纠正。他最讨厌的是开了一整天会却一事无成。他承认自己有时会进行**微观管理**（micromanage: 对下属的工作进行过度细致的监督和控制），尤其是在事情进展不顺利时。但他认为这并非总是坏事。如果事情进展顺利，他会很乐意取消会议，把时间还给团队，让他们专注于其他工作。

<p class="english-text">Why do some cos have execution power? Why do some people get things done? You mentioned that you were number five you know in a particular job and you you managed to do it. Yeah, I would say um you know people when you would ask people you know surrounding me, they would probably say Christian can be sometimes a bit impatient and wants to do decisions sometimes maybe a bit too fast but I'm more acting and managing based on the principle I rather do you know 10 decisions a day and eight are great and two are wrong and I'm the last person who says you know what this decision was absolutely not great by Christian let's revert this decision it was not good so I you know let's course correct it but then I get something done and at the end of the day when I leave and go to home I the thing what I don't hate what I really hate is I was sitting in 10 steering committee spend the whole day here in Waldorf and I have to feel I got nothing done do you micromanage I micromanage you know that is a point yeah which I got you know a lot of blame for in my early years I have have to You know when I micromanage, I micromanage when I feel things are not going well. Yes. Then Christian can really go deep and want to understand the problem. But is this now necessarily a bad thing? But I also have to tell you things which are one in crate. I'm actually so happy to also cancel a meeting that said you know what today we don't have to talk about that because it's one and I see it in the numbers the facts the customers everyone is telling me fantastic. So you know you I give you some time back. You rather focus on other stuff. you don't have to spend the time with me.</p>

在反馈方面，Christian Klein直言不讳。他有时觉得员工因为尊重而不敢给出开放的反馈。他鼓励员工直言不讳，即使不同意他的意见也完全可以。他不断挑战自己，确保自己不会在会议中主导一切，而是鼓励他人发言，培养这种文化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you give feedback? Are you a straight feedback giver? Yeah. But this is a is a big big risk in this job. I sometimes feel people you know have so much respect. Yeah. They are we actually you know concerned about giving you open feedback and so sometimes I sit in meetings I said hey you don't have to be so polite and saying only so many polish things to me. Tell me are you agree with me or not? And if you don't agree it's absolutely right but please tell it to me now because now we are making a very important decision and it's absolutely fair to say no the CEO maybe you know has you know a different opinion than I and so I constantly also first of all challenge myself to you know to come across as you know please give me this feedback and not running into a meeting and speak up you know first and then dominating the whole meeting because then you can you know wonder why you're not getting feedback but it's not surprise but then also you know encouraging others to speak up and I guess this is very very important that you facilitate that kind of culture.</p>

Christian Klein希望改变SAP的企业文化，尤其是在绩效管理方面，给予员工更多自由。他认为，为了保持行业领先地位，需要一种绩效文化。这种文化并非每年淘汰10%的员工，而是经理能够提供建设性反馈，帮助员工进步。他相信绩效文化对高绩效员工很重要，让他们感到努力得到了回报；对新员工也很重要，让他们有机会变得更好；同时也能让团队其他成员明白，SAP确实看重绩效。

<p class="english-text">What's the part of uh SAP corporate culture which you try to change yeah there's a lot of talk these days about performance management and um there's a lot of talk about you know indeed this micro micromanagement and giving more freedom to our people and I guess it got a lot better but you know the thing what I want to actually facilitate especially you know here in in in in Germany in Europe is I mean you know you can always say around you know what is good or bad around you know US labor laws and so on I don't even want to go there but I'm actually convinced that in order to stay at the top of an industry and be a market leader you need a kind of performance culture and performance culture is not about every year kicking 10% of the people out it's about you know what I'm as a manager need to be able to sit here together with you and give you constructive feedback about what was great and what was not so great because in my career especially the things which were not so great helped me to get better. I mean how often did chimna tell me you know what Christian in this meeting first I didn't feel very well prepared there was a certain piece missing and also the way how you argumented you didn't come straight to the point and I said oh yeah I felt the same now but now that you're saying to me it's good now I can go back and think about it and do it better next time but this ability is got a little bit lost and that is something what I want to facilitate so this performance feedback this connotation to Oh, do we want to get rid of people? No, no, no, no. I'm a big believer that performance culture is first of all matters for your high performers so that they see when they walk the extra mile and perform that they really feel rewarded. But it's also for the people who are still new in a job that they have the ability to get better. And of course, it's also then a thing that you also understand, hey, SAP is really looking for performance. It's also not okay for the rest of the team when you're just sitting around and you know doing your job uh you know in a in a way that you know you're just you know pulling the your task activities to others in the team. Yeah.</p>

他认为，欧洲缺乏竞争精神和绩效文化，这与欧洲的官僚主义、规则过多和对安全的过度追求有关。他相信，为了成功，必须承担风险。他以自己的孩子为例，鼓励他们爬樱桃树，而不是完全规避风险。他强调，合规性固然重要，但完全不承担风险会限制个人和公司的发展。欧洲需要从小教育人们承担风险。

<p class="english-text">Do you think um the lack of um uh kind of compar competitive spirit and um performance culture? Do you think it's a function of where Europe is now? you know a bit more bureaucratic more rules more uh security safety it's not easy to implement in in this part of the world right I absolutely do I mean look when I um I mean I see it you know actually also and when I look at my kids I mean do I always tell them don't climb up here the cherry tree no I mean climb up but you know I'm of course still watching but I'm not the one who says hey when you don't take any risks you know how does this further you in your career later when you take zero risk I'm I'm convinced you're also limiting yourself and I mean there's of course a topic like compliance you the compliance is super important you always should stay compliant but there's a big difference of not taking any kind of risk and I guess here in Europe I really feel we also need to educate especially already in in in school in the university that risk takingaking is absolutely something what you have to do in order to succeed yeah because you know when I look at my compet competitors around there. I mean of course every decision you do, every investment decision, every portfolio decision you do, there is some risk into it. I could sit here the whole day and say you know what we don't transform. Actually it's great SAP is you know here at a certain level we stop our transformation and we just stay where we are. That would be probably the way of where I would get, you know, much less resistance here and there, much less criticism, but it would be 100% the one thing for this company to just stay where we are because tech is moving fast, AI is moving fast. So, we have to continue to transform.</p>

### 个人生活与未来展望

Christian Klein通过滑雪和登山来放松身心，尤其是在没有手机干扰的情况下，与家人朋友共度时光。他还喜欢在桑拿房里独处，思考世界和地缘政治。他提到自己每周会蒸五次桑拿，甚至在晚上进行美国电话会议时也会提前打开桑拿房。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Question, how do you relax? Relax? Um, actually, I I love to ski. Uh, I really love to ski. I love the mountains. um both in even more in winter but also in the summer when you don't have always your mobile with you and that is for me great with the family with friends and then of course you know I have my sauna where I can you know do you know also spend a bit time for me I guess it's also very important I love the family but sometimes it's also to come down and to digest what happened in the day and to think a little bit broader about the world and everything what is happening on the geopolitical side that is also some time which is very very important for me to come down. So we interviewed 100 leaders you are the first one who mentioned a sona so perhaps perhaps you have a fin inside you or something because I I do sona you know probably five times a week I actually can almost compete with you on that one. Yeah. So I you know often times when I do my US calls in the evening uh and it's then around 9 10 in the evening I turn on the sound now not during the call but I already turn on the sona and then I hop in you know before I go to to to bed or you know I I'm I'm a big I'm I really really love it and it's a good way for me to come down and relax.</p>

他阅读大量商业报纸和研究报告，尤其对知识图谱和**向量引擎**（vector engines: 一种数据库技术，用于存储和检索高维向量数据，常用于AI领域）等最新研究感兴趣。他认为向量引擎在结合结构化和非结构化内容方面，对AI的力量至关重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What do you read? What do I read? Uh I read a lot of you know of course you know business newspapers. I lead a lot of research. I love research. I sometimes tell my co, give me the latest research on knowledge graphs. Give me the latest re research on vector engines, etc. Because I'm now not the deepest technologist. But what I love about this research is what do you like about vector engines? But vector engines, I mean the point is when you look at, you know, AI and you need to, you know, have now structured and unstructured content. The power of AI is to bring those two together and the vector engine is actually a very very important piece in that under lastly.</p>
