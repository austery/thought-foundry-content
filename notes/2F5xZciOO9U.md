### 播客开场与会议背景

**Joe Weisenthal:** 大家好，欢迎收听《OddLots》播客的又一期节目，我是乔·魏森塔尔。

<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to another episode of the OddLots podcast. I'm Joe Weisenthal</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 我是特蕾西·阿洛韦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I'm Tracy Aloway.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 特蕾西，我们是在8月21日星期四录制这期节目的，地点是**杰克逊霍尔**（Jackson Hole: 每年由堪萨斯城联邦储备银行主办的全球央行年会）。我需要在一开始就说明，我们是在**鲍威尔**（Jay Powell: 现任美联储主席）发表重要讲话之前录制的。我真的不认为这有多大关系，但这只是为了提供一些经济会议的时间背景。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So Tracy, we are recording this on Thursday, August 21st. We are here at Jackson Hall. I need to note at the beginning, we were recording this before the big Paulo speech. I don't really think it matters too much because that's But I just want to like get that out of the way. A little timing context for an econ</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 我们不会讨论那次讲话，原因很明显，我们不知道会说什么。但我们可以讨论现在的经济状况，这在现在和明天早上之间不会改变，希望如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">conference. We're not going to talk about that speech for obvious reasons. We don't know what's going to be said. But what we can talk about is the economy right now. That's not going to change between, you know, right now and tomorrow morning. Hopefully</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 无论这期节目何时发布，可能都不会有太大变化。但我们最近非常幸运，与许多**地区联储主席**（regional Fed presidents: 联邦储备银行的行长，负责各自区域的经济事务并参与美联储货币政策制定）进行了交流，能够接触到他们真是太棒了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">whenever this comes out, probably it's not going to change much. But, you know, we've been very lucky lately. We've been talking to a lot of uh regional Fed presidents and it's really cool that we have access to that.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 是的，而且能够听到各种不同的意见也很好，因为正如我们一直在讨论的，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. And it's good to get a range of opinions as well because as we've been discussing,</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 经济目前看起来非常不确定，你可以为各种情况找到理由，从**降息**（rate cut: 央行降低基准利率）到维持利率不变，甚至可能**加息**（hiking: 央行提高基准利率），杰夫·施密特在采访我们时也曾暗示过这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">the economy does look very uncertain right now and you could make a case for everything from a rate cut to holding to possibly even maybe hiking uh which you know Jeff Schmidt kind of alluded to when we interviewed him.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的，这相当不寻常，你看，你可以说股市接近历史高点，**信用利差**（credit spreads: 风险债券收益率与无风险债券收益率之间的差额，反映市场对信贷风险的看法）接近历史低点，就业率低，通胀仍然偏高。我们为什么要谈论降息呢？无论如何，我们必须从那些最了解经济的人那里获得更多观点和看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. No, it was pretty extraordinary that like look, you could make a point that stock markets near record highs, credit spreads near record lows, employment uh low, and inflation still warm. Why are we talking about rate cuts? Anyway, we got to keep getting more takes and perspectives on this from the people who actually think about this the best. And uh we</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 如果我们采访了所有联储主席，我们会得到一个奖品吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">do we get a prize if we interview every Fed president?</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 嗯，我们应该试试。这应该有个名字。但我们有一位嘉宾，一位完美的嘉宾，我们之前在播客中采访过他。非常高兴能在杰克逊霍尔现场请到他，他曾是《OddLots》的嘉宾，芝加哥联储主席奥斯坦·古尔斯比。奥斯坦，非常感谢你。我现在要给你一个奖品。我开车来的，刚到这里一个半小时。

<p class="english-text">Well, we should try. There's got to there should be a name for that. But we have a guest, perfect guest, someone we've talked to on the podcast before. very excited to have live here in Jackson Hall, past Oddlot's guest, uh, Chicago Fed President Austin Goulsby. So, Austin, thank you so much. I'm gonna give you a prize. Now, I drove here. I just got here. I just got in an hour and a half ago.</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 我相信我是开车最远来这里的人。我在路上做的一件事是完成了我访问的第50个州——北达科他州。哦，结果发现很多人都把北达科他州作为他们访问的最后一个州，并且有一个官方俱乐部叫做“最佳留到最后俱乐部”（Best for Last Club），我加入了这个俱乐部。那么，谁将是你们采访的第12位储备银行行长呢？你们会得到一个奖品。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I believe that I've driven the farthest of anybody to get here. And one of the things I did on the way was finish my 50th state, North Dakota. Oh, and it turns out there's a a lot of people North Dakota is their last state and there's officially a club called the Best for Last Club and I joined the Best for Last Club. So, who's going to be your 12th Reserve Bank president? You're going to get a prize.</p>

**Tracy Alloway:** 恭喜。我在推特上看到了你的公路旅行，我看到你在发帖。

### 当前经济展望与通胀担忧

**Joe Weisenthal:** 最近你觉得经济怎么样？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How's the economy looking to you these days?</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 嗯，这取决于你面向哪个方向。如你所知，我认为第一季度到四月份的时候，经济看起来相当不错。我们有稳定的充分就业，失业率略高于4%。通胀虽然已经连续四年高于目标，但在我看来，它正在持续下降，并朝着2%的目标迈进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it depends which direction you're facing. As you know, I thought for Q1 coming into April, it was looking pretty good. We had a stable full employment, the unemployment rate a little above four. inflation while having been above the target for four years looked to me like it was heading it was coming down and down and down and was headed to 2%.</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 所以我认为，合理的近似是利率需要开始下降到我们认为它们将稳定下来的水平，这比我们当时和现在都要低很多。然后我们经历了一些颠簸。我听说过它们。把一堆尘土扬到空中。所有这些都让人觉得，经济是仍然停留在1月、2月、3月的状态，还是我们走上了一条不同的道路？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I thought reasonable approximation rates need to start heading down to where we think they're going to settle which is a fair bit below where where we were then where we are today. Then we go through some bumps. I've heard of them. Threw a bunch of dirt in the air. all of this stuff that it's like is the economy still where it was in January, February, March, or are we on some different path?</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 我仍然私下希望/认为我们回到了以前的状态，而且**关税**（tariffs: 对进口商品征收的税费）和进口商品只占**GDP**（Gross Domestic Product: 国内生产总值，衡量一个国家经济产出的总价值）的11%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I still closet hope slash think that we're where we were before and that tariffs, imported goods are only 11% of GDP. Mhm.</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 如果它们能保持在自己的轨道上，如果我们不继续升级它们，如果我们不随意将它们应用于中间产品，以至于它们变成更高的生产成本，那可能就没问题了。我们有几个月温和的通胀数据，然后我们得到了最新的通胀数据，它不那么温和，而且**服务业通胀**（services inflation: 服务部门商品和服务的价格上涨）的上升让我感到有些逆流。所以我想说，我仍然密切关注通胀。我们现在已经连续四年半高于目标。连续四年半高于目标是一回事，但我们仍然明显呈下降趋势。是的。如果我们开始呈上升趋势，并且你开始看到非关税影响类别的通胀上升，就像我们在服务业看到的那样，那么我就会变得更加紧张。在就业方面，我仍然觉得我们处于某种稳定的充分就业状态。修正数据确实令人担忧。我们也知道，当有大规模移民发生时，劳动力供应和人口增长会给每月的**月度就业报告**（monthly payroll: 非农就业报告，衡量每月新增就业人数）带来很多噪音。所以我不想过度解读这一点。我想采取多种衡量标准。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If they'll kind of stay in their lane, if we don't keep escalating them, if we don't willy-nilly apply them to intermediate goods so that they turn into higher cost of production, it'd probably be okay. And we had a couple of months of benign inflation numbers and then we got the last inflation number which is a little less benign and the rise of services inflation threw me for a little bit of a cross current. So I'd say I've still got one eye on inflation. We're now 4 and 1/2 years above the target. It's one thing to be four and a half years above the target, but we're still clearly trending down. Yeah. If we start trending up and you start seeing inflation rising in non-tariff affected categories like what we saw in services, then I'm going to get a little more nervous on that side. And on the job side, I still feel like we're something like stable full employment. The revisions, they are concerning. We also know that the labor supply and population growth when there's big immigration things happening add a lot of noise to just monthly payroll. So I don't want to overindex on that. I want to take multiple measures.</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 在我看来，“真相与正义的四骑士”是：它们受移民和人口**劳动力供应**（labor supply: 经济中可用于生产商品和服务的工人数量）问题的影响较小。它们是**失业率**（unemployment rate）、**招聘率**（hiring rate）、**裁员率**（layoff rate）和**职位空缺率**（vacancy rate）。如果你看这些比率，其中三个仍然表明这基本上是充分就业，而且看起来很好。它看起来与2018年、2019年非常相似，是一个强劲的就业市场。招聘率很低。如果你和大学毕业生的父母交谈，你会听到找工作很难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The four horsemen of truth and justice in my view are rates. They're less susceptible to the immigration and population labor supply problems. They're the unemployment rate, the hiring rate, the layoff rate, the vacancy rate. If you look at those rates, three of them still say this is basically full employment and it's looking fine. It looks very similar to 2018 2019, a strong job market. The hiring rate is low. And if you talk to parents of kids graduating from college, you hear it's tough.</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 找工作很难。我们正处于一个低离职率、低招聘率的环境中，但这可能就是充分就业。明白吗？所以我说，我并不反对降息。如果我们能度过这一阶段，并且在关税方面能解决一些问题，我们可能仍然很容易走在黄金道路上。继续下降可能仍然完全合理，但我们同时也有一些警示信号。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's tough to get a job. We're in a low separations, low hiring environment, but that might be full employment. Okay? So that's why I say I don't come to it averse to cutting of rates. If we get through this and we can get some stuff settled on the tariff side, we might easily still be on the golden path. It might still make perfect sense to keep going down, but we've just got a couple of flags at the same time.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我想你刚才在一个问题中涵盖了我们所有的讨论要点。谢谢你过来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think you just hit all of our talking points in that one question. Thank you for coming out.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 我们会深入探讨所有这些事情，但在我们开始之前，我有一个问题。也许这有点像问别人他们最喜欢的孩子是谁，但目前你最关心的是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We will dig into all these things, but just before we do, I have one question. Maybe it's a bit like asking um someone who their favorite child is, but what's occupying most of your headsp space at the moment?</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 我以为你正要说芝加哥是你最喜欢的银行，我会说好选择。好选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I thought you were about to say Chicago is your favorite bank and I was going to say good choice. Good choice.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 不。是通胀还是劳动力市场？你最关心什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No. Is it inflation or the labor market? What are you thinking most about?</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 我会说是通胀。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'd say inflation.</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 我仍然在考虑通胀。如果我们有四个月温和的通胀，看起来像早期的那些月份，那会让我对这个想法感到更舒服。它不会是，你知道，关税保持在11%的范围内。人们没有惊慌失措。一切都会好起来的。现在让我们去考虑就业方面，因为我们看到了一些颠簸和事情正在上升。我担心我们必须考虑通胀方面，考虑到历史。如果我们是在2019年进行这次讨论，并且我们没有经历过“暂时性通胀论”的团队，以及非常相同的论点，比如不不，这是一次性的事情，所以通胀应该很快就会消失。如果我们没有经历过这些，我就会更舒服地提出这个论点。但现在我甚至不喜欢使用那个词。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm still thinking inflation. If we had four benign months of inflation that looked like those kind of early ones, that would have helped me be much more comfortable with the idea. It's not going to be, you know, tariffs stayed in their 11% lane. People aren't freaking out. It's going to be fine. Let's just go think about the employment side now that we seeing a couple of bumps and things ticking up. I fear we gotta we got to think about that inflation side just given what the history was. If we were having this discussion in 2019 and we hadn't had the team transitory and the argu the very same arguments like no no this a one-time thing and so the inflation should just go away real quickly. If that we hadn't had that, I would be much more comfortable making that argument. But now that I don't even like using that word.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 此外，现在每个人都经历了通胀。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Plus, everyone has experienced inflation now.</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 每个人都经历了。所以他们更兴奋了。他们更紧张了。不是兴奋。他们更紧张地看到它。你看，消费者信心指数有所显著下降。通胀预期的调查衡量标准，公平地说，我总是说我对其重视程度低于基于市场的衡量标准。尽管如此，我并非完全不重视它们。如果你看到调查中人们被问到：“你认为未来一年、两年，甚至更长时间的通胀会是多少？”他们会说更高。所以我们必须考虑这一点。你提到了劳动力市场修正数据，当我们得到上次就业报告时，它表现平平，但更重要的是前两个月的下调，这实际上让我有两种看法。一种是，哦，你知道吗，劳动力市场正在真正减速，如果我们想保持充分就业，我们可能很快就不得不降息。但还有另一种看法，这在最近几期节目中也出现过，那就是，是的，那是4月2日之后的波动。我们现在已经度过了那个阶段，实际上我们比以前有了更多的关税确定性。那可能就是低谷。我们今天得到了**标普全球采购经理人指数**（S&P flash PMI: 标普全球发布的采购经理人指数，衡量制造业和服务业的经济活动）的初步数据，它实际上显示了积极的就业评级。这在我们与杰夫·施密特的谈话中也提到了，他正在为堪萨斯城联储举办这次活动，也许那只是今年周期性的低点，只是那几个月的疯狂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Everyone's experienced. So, they're more hyped up. They're more amped up. Not hyped up. They're they're amped up to see it. And look, you see this consumer confidence numbers going down somewhat significantly. survey measures of inflation expectations, which I in fairness always said I put less weight on than market-based measures. That said, I don't put zero weight on them. And if you see people in surveys ask, "What do you think inflation is going to be over the next one year, two years, now even longer, they're saying it's higher." So, we we got to think about that. You mentioned those labor market revisions and when we got that last jobs report it was mediocre but even more than mediocre was those it was the pull down of the prior two months and it there's actually strikes me as two ways of looking at this. One is oh you know what the labor market is really decelerating that probably we have to have cut soon if we want to hold on to full employment. But there's another take that actually has come up in a couple of recent episodes which is well yeah that was the postappril 2nd volatility. We're through that now that actually we have more tariff certainty than we we certainly have more tariff certainty than we did. That was maybe the trough. We got a S&P flash PMI today that actually showed a positive employment rating. This came up in our conversation with Jeff Schmid who's throwing this event for the Kansas City Fed that maybe that was the cyclical low for the year just though that the craziness of those couple months.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 太有趣了。我以为你会完全走另一条路。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Fascinating. I thought you were going to go totally different way.</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 所以这是两种思想流派，它们都基于使用月度就业报告作为我们所处**商业周期**（business cycle: 经济活动扩张和收缩的周期性波动）的指标。在正常时期，这是完全合适的。我的第三类是，在人口增长发生变化的时候。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So those are two schools of thought both of which are premised on using monthly payroll as an indicator of where we are in the business cycle. And in normal times, that's perfectly appropriate. My third category is at moments when there are population growth shifts. Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 在劳动力供应，特别是移民带来的劳动力供应发生变化时，要小心使用月度就业报告来判断商业周期。那不是因为，我没有，这是悔恨吗？不是悔恨。我没有，我谈论这个话题不感到内疚，因为你可以回顾一年半前，甚至更早，当我们得到的就业数据远高于我们认为的**盈亏平衡点**（break even: 在就业市场中，指每月需要创造的就业岗位数量，以保持失业率稳定）时。当时有一群人说，我们即将迎来通胀大幅回升，因为每月18万个就业岗位比盈亏平衡点要快。盈亏平衡点大约是每月8.5万个。所以我们正在过热。当时我说，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And labor supply, especially from immigration, be careful using monthly payroll for the business cycle. That wasn't for that wasn't one of because And I have no is it remorse? Not remorse. I have no I don't feel guilty talking about this topic now because you can go back and look a year and a half ago and more when we were getting jobs numbers that were far higher than what we thought the break even was. There was a one group that was saying we're about to have inflation kick way back up because 180,000 jobs a month is faster than break even. break even is like 85,000 a month. So, we're overheating. And at that time, I said,</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 不要关注，但要比平时少关注就业报告和就业数据，因为我们知道幕后有大量移民正在发生，但尚未显现出来。现在，当我们回顾时，每个人都说：“哦，是的，显然这就是我们创造这么多就业岗位的原因。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">not pay no attention, but pay less attention than you normally would payroll and jobs numbers say because we know there's a whole bunch of immigration that's happening behind the scenes that is not showing up yet. Now, when we look back, everybody says, "Oh, yeah, obviously that's why we generate as many jobs."</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 这只是完全相同的想法，但方向相反。现在它可能不会被证明是真的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is just the exact same idea but in reverse. Now it may prove not to be true.</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 这可能是一个商业周期的指标，但我们上次学到的是，那些“真相四骑士”是比率而不是总量。好的。所以如果你不知道人口增长率是多少，或者它与你预期的不同，那么对总就业人数和总GDP增长要格外警惕。所以如果你开始看到GDP总体增长正在放缓，但其组成部分并没有真正表明这一点，或者如果你开始看到就业增长，你将其描述为平庸。我不认为它是7.5万。这正好在盈亏平衡点附近。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This might be an indicator of the business cycle but we learned the last time around that those four horsemen of truth were rates not aggregates. Okay. So if you don't know what the population growth rate is or if it's different than what you expected, be extra suspicious about total payroll employment and total GDP growth. So if you started to see GDP growth overall is slowing down, but the components don't really suggest that or if you start seeing payroll growth, you characterize it as mediocre. I don't think it was like 75,000. That's right around the break even.</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 如果你在7.5万上下浮动10万，这通常是月度就业报告的情况，你就会遇到就业人数较低的月份。然后如果你再把移民因素加进去，就像我说的，我不是说要忽略它。我只是说要非常小心。我有点不解，但也有点担心市场反应似乎是：

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you're 75,000 plus or minus a 100,000, which is normally what you are for monthly payroll, you're going to get months where you have low payroll. And then if you add this immigration thing on top of it, like I say, I'm not saying ignore it. I'm just saying be very careful. I was a little not puzzled but I was a little concerned that the market reaction seemed to be</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 让我们把对2018年左右月度就业数据的理解拿出来，然后说那一定意味着我们即将陷入衰退。对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">let's take our understanding of monthly payroll numbers circa 2018 and say that must mean we're on the verge of recession. Right?</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 如果你的想法是这样，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If that's where your head is</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 你说，过去较低的月度就业人数一直是经济衰退开始的指标。那么你必须解释为什么其他指标没有显示出这一点。为什么裁员率如此之低？你没有看到裁员增加。职位空缺率实际上正在略微上升，并且比2019年更好。我认为是这样。这看起来还不像一个正常的商业周期。如果它开始像，我将是第一个说这就是经济衰退开始的样子的人。所以这个想法是，较弱的就业增长可以被或正在被较弱的劳动力供应所抵消，因为我们得到的移民减少了。所以盈亏平衡率是

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that you say well a low monthly payroll in the past has been an indicator of the beginning of recession. Then you got to explain why these other ones don't show that. Why is the layoff rate as low as it is? You have you haven't seen an uptick in layoffs. The vacancy rate is actually rising a little and is better than it was in 2019. I think so. This doesn't look like a normal business cycle yet. If it starts to, I'll be the first one saying this is what re the beginning of a recession looks like. So the idea is that weaker payrolls can be offset or are being offset by weaker labor supply because we're getting less immigration. So the break even rate is</p>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 盈亏平衡点更低。

<p class="english-text">that the break even is lower.</p>

### 市场反应与货币政策的限制性

**Tracy Alloway:** 是的。好的。你刚才提到了市场反应。我们能多谈谈市场吗？因为正如乔所说，你知道，股市仍然接近历史高点。我知道它们本周有所下跌。信用利差处于27年来的低点。我仍然听到美联储官员谈论利率具有**限制性**（restrictive: 货币政策立场，指利率水平高于中性利率，旨在抑制经济活动），尽管通胀仍然高于目标。但当我观察市场，当我观察金融状况时，它对我来说并不那么具有限制性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Okay. You mentioned the market reaction just then. Can we talk a little bit more about the market because as Joe mentioned, you know, stocks are still kind of near their record highs. I know they've been falling a bit this week. Credit spreads at like a 27-year low. I still hear Fed officials talk about rates being restrictive even though inflation is still above target. But when I look at the market, when I look at financial conditions, it doesn't look that restrictive to me.</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 听着，要小心。我们只是处于过去几年我在美联储期间一直在进行的相同讨论的奇怪的“玻璃洋葱”版本。我快三年了。当时是积极的供应冲击，整个问题是：我们是否即将再次过热？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look, be careful. We're just in the weird glass onion version of the same discussions we've been having for several years now that I've been in the Fed. I'm coming on three years. At that time it was positive supply shocks and the whole question was are we about to reoverheat?</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 我们是否需要维持，我们是否需要继续加息？我们是否需要将利率维持在如此高的水平，还是可以开始降息？我有点认为，市场预期和市场反应中的一个主要组成部分是“反映问题”。也就是说，如果他们认为美联储会成功，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do we need to maintain do we need to keep raising? Do we need to maintain the rates this high or can we start cutting? I kind of think that a large component of what's in expectations and what's in the market's reaction is the reflection problem. that if they think that the Fed is going to succeed,</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 那么你可能会看到条件放松，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">then you could see conditions loosen,</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 但这不一定是美联储应该加息的理由，因为他们的前提是认为它会奏效。这就是我之前说的，我现在也以同样的方式思考。这可能是一个迹象，但如果你只看利率，看货币政策的传统信贷渠道，我仍然认为利率相对具有限制性。所以这就是为什么我说，如果你开始看到劳动力市场恶化，你开始看到裁员增加，并且它开始更像劳动力市场的转折点，那么我认为我们将不得不认真考虑降息。如果我们处于一个实际上相当稳定的充分就业环境，唯一发生的事情是人口使得盈亏平衡的月度就业人数从10万变为4万，并且通胀在许多与关税无关的类别中上升。那么现在我们必须更加谨慎。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but that wouldn't be a reason that the Fed should raise necessarily because they're premised on thinking that it's going to work. That's what I was saying before and I kind of now think in the same way. It might be an indication, but if you just look at rates and you look at kind of the traditional credit channels of monetary policy, I still think that rates are relatively restrictive. And so that's why I say if you start to see deterioration in the labor market, you start to see layoffs going up and it starts looking more like a the turning point in the labor market, then I think we're going to have to seriously contemplate cutting of rates. If we're in an environment where we're actually in pretty stable full employment and the only thing that's happening is population is making the break even monthly jobs number 40,000 instead of 100,000 and inflation is going up in a bunch of categories that are not tariff related. Uh now we got to be a little more circumspect.</p>

### 长期利率与中性利率的变化

**Joe Weisenthal:** 所以我想问你一个问题。这是我越来越感兴趣的事情，并且想和更多人讨论等等。但正如你所说，经济的某些方面可能与2018年、2019年等时期相似。有一件事让我觉得非常不同，那就是长期利率，以及因此隐含的，人们所说的**中性利率**（neutral rate: 既不刺激也不抑制经济增长的理论利率水平）或其他什么。也许很快就会降息，但市场并不预期会有一个深度的降息周期。终端利率是多少？什么改变了？2025年与2018年相比，根本性的区别是什么，以至于美联储要达到2%的通胀目标，市场却在为比疫情前预期高得多的利率定价？

<p class="english-text">So I want to ask you a question. It's something that I'm very increasingly interested in and want to talk to a lot more people about etc. But there are aspects of this economy that as you say may kind of resemble 2018, 2019 etc. One thing that strikes me as very different is the long-term rate and and the implied therefore what people will call the the neutral rate or whatever and maybe rate cuts are coming soon but the market is not expecting a deep cutting cycle of that terminal rates. What's changed? What's the fundamental difference in 2025 verse 2018 such that for the Fed to hit its 2% inflation target the market is pricing in so much higher rates than what it had anticipated prior to co</p>

<p class="english-text">I would say there's one way to look at that that if you asked historically which of those is weird</p>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 2018年、2019年才是奇怪的，你明白我的意思吗？就像现在的长期利率看起来非常

**Austan Goolsbee:** 非常类似于历史模式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">very similar to kind of historical patterns.</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 有一个庞大的，几乎是一个研究行业，试图诊断这个问题，这又引出了一个问题：我们是否会回到超低利率，因为是**全球储蓄过剩**（global savings glut: 一种经济理论，指全球储蓄超过了投资需求，导致利率下降）吗？生产力是否发生了什么变化？他们是否认为需求会很低？是否有一种感觉，财政部将不得不发行大量债务？我的意思是，全球的**债务与GDP比率**（debt to GDP ratios: 国家债务总额与国内生产总值之比，衡量国家偿债能力）大幅增加。我确实发现贷款利率的这种上升并非美国独有，这很有启发性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's a whole tremendous almost industry in research trying to diagnose that and that bleeds into the question of are we going back to super low rates, ultra low rates because is it global savings glut? Is there something happening with productivity? Do they think demand is going to be low? Is there a feeling that Treasury is going to have to issue so much debt? I mean, there's been a big increase in debt to GDP ratios worldwide. I do find informative this increase in loan rates is not exclusive to the US.</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 你在很多国家都看到了。所以我不知道。嗯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You see it in a lot of countries. So, I don't I don't totally know. Mhm.</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 可能有很多这些解释。无论出于何种原因，市场认为美联储在短期利率方面会做什么，似乎对30年期利率有超乎寻常的影响。所以，这部分原因可能只是反映了他们认为美联储会采取多么陡峭或平缓的路径。所以回到通胀问题一秒钟。你已经提过几次，你担心关税引起的商品通胀可能会蔓延到服务业。你能多谈谈你认为这种传导机制是如何运作的吗？另外，你是**第七区**（seventh district: 指芝加哥联邦储备银行所管辖的区域，包括伊利诺伊州、印第安纳州、爱荷华州、密歇根州和威斯康星州的部分地区）的负责人，那里有一些有趣的州。你有仍然生产汽车的密歇根州。你有农民的爱荷华州。你看到了商品到服务业的传导情况吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's probably some of many of those explanations. And for whatever reason, what the market thinks the Fed is going to do in short rates does seem to have a outsized impact on 30-year rates. So, that's part of it is probably just reflecting how steep or how shallow a path do they think the Fed is going to take. So just going back to inflation for a second. You've mentioned a couple times now that you're worried about maybe, you know, tariff induced inflation in goods starting to seep into services. Can you talk a little bit more about how you see that channel actually working? And then also, you're head of the seventh district and you have some interesting states in there. You've got Michigan, which still makes cars. You've got Iowa, which has farmers. like what are you seeing in terms of the pass through from goods to services there?</p>

### 关税对地区经济和通胀的影响

**Austan Goolsbee:** 好的，这些都是我们需要深入思考的重要话题。让我们倒序来。总部设在芝加哥的第七区是所有地区中制造业最密集的，也是汽车生产量最大的地区。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, these are both important topics for us to think through. Let's go backwards in order. The seventh district headquartered in Chicago is the most manufacturing intensive of all the districts and by far the most auto production of all the districts.</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 它是主要的农业大区之一，但堪萨斯城、明尼阿波利斯，还有其他几个。我想说，在4月2日之前、4月2日当天以及一直到5月甚至6月，他们都非常紧张。

<details>

<p class="english-text">It's one of the big agricultureheavy districts, but Kansas City, Minneapolis, there there's a couple of others. I would say in the runup to April 2nd and through April 2nd into May almost to June, they their hair was on fire.</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 我的意思是，这会把我们彻底摧毁。如果任何事情都像他们刚刚宣布的那些税率一样，我们这些汽车供应商本来利润就很低，我们就会完蛋。我们不知道会发生什么。这就是我当时对此感到紧张的原因。

<details>

That's why I was getting amped up about it at the time</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 随着我们对税率有了更清晰的了解，特别是当他们开始豁免符合**美墨加协定**（USMCA: United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement，取代北美自由贸易协定NAFTA的贸易协议）的产品时，它不会适用于许多中间产品，也不会影响商业。

</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 我想说，当我与制造业和农业领域的人交谈时，他们仍然处于那个状态。在农业领域，他们特别受到鼓舞，因为一些谈判得以完成，即使没有回到零关税，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would say as I talk to people now for manufacturing and for agriculture they're still in that space in agriculture. They were particularly heartened by as some of the negotiations got concluded, even if they weren't going back to no tariffs,</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 事实是他们将走向一个不会导致报复的局面，这对农业来说是一件非常重要的事情，因为他们最大的市场很多都在海外。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the fact that they were going to something that would not lead to retaliation was a very big thing for agriculture because a lot of their biggest markets are overseas.</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 我最近刚去了爱荷华州，尽管那个领域仍然很紧张，因为在某些方面，损害已经造成，而且建立这些出口关系需要很长时间，如果你破坏了这些关系，他们就开始从巴西购买大豆，即使你回到零关税，他们可能已经建立了这些关系。所以有一种挥之不去的感觉，即长期影响将不同于短期影响。但我会把短期影响的程度从我总是把防御等级搞反了。**防御等级五**（Defcon Five: 美国国防部战备状态等级，Defcon 5是最低戒备状态，Defcon 1是最高戒备状态）是最糟糕的。对。所以

<details>

<p class="english-text">I was just recently in Iowa though there's still nervous in that space that in some ways the damage is already done and it takes a long time to build up these export relationships and if you smash that and they start buying soybeans from Brazil that even if you go back to zero tariffs they might have already set it up. So there is like a nagging that the longer run impact will be different than the shortrun impact. But I would characterize shortrun impact scaled down from I always get the defcons backward.

### 关税如何转化为服务业通胀

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is the mechanism that tariffs turn into inflation of goods</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 而不仅仅是一次性价格上涨？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">as opposed to just a one-time price increase?</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 因为有一种观点认为，对于理论上理想的一次性关税，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because there is an argument that for the platonic ideal of a theoretical one and done tariff,</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 它只是一次性价格上涨。所以无论是什么，只要看穿它，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it's just a one-time price increase. So no matter what it is, just look through it,</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 对吗？一次性价格上涨，需要明确的是，在传统经济框架下不计入通胀，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right? And a one-time price increase, just to be clear, doesn't count as inflation under traditional economic frameworks</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 因为基本上如果你去衡量通胀，通胀会高一年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because basically if you go measure inflation, inflation would be high for one year.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 然后通胀就会消失。但这正是2021年“**暂时性通胀论**”（team transitory: 指在疫情初期，一些经济学家和政策制定者认为通胀是暂时现象的观点）团队的论点，即是的，这个东西打击了供应。我们会让过去的事过去。我们会忍受一年的通胀，然后它就会消失。现在请记住，这是一次性关税，这不是一次，也没有完成。所以我们应该更谨慎地仅仅说，嘿，理论上它会消失。我们在新冠疫情中学到，如果对供应链的影响足够大，特别是如果它从行业A传导到行业B，行业B为C生产投入，那么这个过程比我们2019年和2020年想象的要长得多。到了2021年，我们想，是的，嘿，它会自行修复，你知道，大概六个月。那是“暂时性通胀论”的论点。所以我有点担心关税对商品通胀本身的影响会持续比我们希望的更长时间，并且人们会混淆。你会记得21年、22年以及23年那些完全有效的论点，当时人们说，即使是供应冲击引起的通胀也无关紧要。如果它持续时间太长，它就会融入预期，然后我们就永远摆脱不了它。这在上次并没有被证明是真的，但如果人们对价格上涨更加敏感，它可能会。我们必须在这方面小心。现在问这个问题，它如何转化为服务业通胀？一部分是，如果服务业通胀不是来自关税呢？好的，所以这就是服务业通胀的危险之处，你无法真正给出一个简单的机制来解释为什么服务业通胀会上升。新的一个月服务业通胀相当糟糕，其中一部分是非市场决定的。所以我对那些的重视程度较低，但它并不好。你可能需要思考关税如何导致这种机制。我认为你很难弄清楚它会如何导致。但这并不能让你感觉更好。那只会让你感觉更糟，因为它就像，等等，也许一些通胀动态从未被扑灭，你有没有像生篝火一样？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the inflation would go away. But that was the very argument of team transitory in 2021 was yes, here this thing hits supply. We're going to let bygones be bygones. will eat the inflation for one year and then it's going to go away. Now remember this is for a oneandone tariff and this is not one and this is not done. So let's be a little more circumspect of just saying hey theoretically it's just going to go away. We learned in COVID that if it's a big enough impact on the supply chain and especially if it's going industry A to industry B, industry B makes inputs for C, that process takes a lot longer than we thought it would in 2019 and 2020. When we got to 2021, we're like, yeah, hey, it'll fix itself, you know, probably six months. That was the argument of transitory. So I'm a little concerned about just the impact of tariffs on goods inflation itself lasting longer than we wanted to and people getting mixed up. You'll recall the perfectly valid arguments in 21 and 22 and into 23 where people said it doesn't matter if it's supply shock induced inflation. If it's high for too long, it's going to fold into expectations and then we'll never get rid of it. That didn't prove true this last time, but if people are more attuned to price increases, it could. And we just got to be careful on that front. Now ask the question, how does it turn into services inflation? One part, what if the services inflation isn't coming from tariffs? Okay, so that's the the danger of services inflation is you kind of can't really give a simple mechanism of why services inflation would be rising. The new month of services inflation was quite terrible and some part of that are non-market determined. So I put a little less weight on those but it wasn't good. That probably the mechanisms that you think through how would tariffs cause that. I think you'd be hardressed to figure out how it would cause it. But that doesn't make you feel better. That makes you feel worse because it's like whoa whoa wait a minute. Maybe some inflationary dynamic was never put out and you ever like make the campfire</p>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 是一种**工资-物价螺旋上升**（wage-price spiraling: 工资上涨导致物价上涨，物价上涨又促使工人要求更高工资的循环），人们会说：“嗯，我认为物价会上涨，所以我会在与雇主进行工资谈判时更加积极。”

</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 我之所以犹豫不决，是因为你可能会说：“那么工资呢？工资与2%的通胀兼容吗？”在你了解**生产力增长率**（productivity growth: 衡量经济效率的指标，即每单位投入所能生产的产出量）之前，你无法回答这个问题，而这正是亮点之一。但这实际上是我对关税最大的担忧之一，经济学研究中有大量文献表明，提高关税，特别是对零部件和供应品的关税，会降低生产力增长。

But that's actually my one of my bigger fears about the tariffs is there's a long literature of research in economics showing you raise tariffs, especially on components, supplies, it drives down productivity growth.</p>

</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 更多是后者。我觉得更多是后者。你知道规则。我不允许代表其他人发言。代表委员会发言。代表主席发言。你知道，我是杰伊·鲍威尔的长期粉丝。我认为他是一位首轮入选名人堂的美联储主席，他有出色的判断力。他还成功引导了委员会中相当多样化的世界观。这就是为什么我觉得它不太是第一种情况。每个人都有相同的世界观。你可以从会议纪要中看到，

<p class="english-text">It's more the latter. I feel like it's more the latter. You know the rules. I'm not allowed to speak for anybody else. Speak for the committee. Speak for the chair. You know, I'm a longtime fan of Jay Pal. I think he's a first ballot hall of fame fed chair and he has a great judgment. He has also navigated a pretty diverse set of worldviews on that committee. That's what makes me feel it's less the first thing. Everybody just has the same world view. You can see from a minute</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 那不是真的。人们有不同的世界观。

<p class="english-text">that that's not true. People have different worldviews.</p>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 他非常擅长，无论是通过声明，还是通过书面文件，让来自不同方面的人都能同意。是的，我同意这一点。我认为这就是异议较少的原因。

<p class="english-text">He's been remarkably skilled at whether it's through statements, whether it's through like what's what's written on the page that everybody you coming from different sides, but you can agree. Yes, I agree with that. And I think that's why there are fewer</p>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 异议，但在我任职期间，最后两次会议有两次。不，我知道。是的。是的。我能问一下，总的来说，你们现在聚在一起时气氛怎么样？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">descents, but in the time I've been there, there have been two at the last. No, I know. Yeah. Yeah. Can I ask in general, what are the vibes like right now when you guys are getting together?</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 乔会翻白眼吗？那个。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Is Joe going to roll his eyes? That one.</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 主席们经常聚在一起。储备银行的主席们经常聚在一起。我们有一个主席会议。我们有很多运营方面的事情要做，我们是一群古怪的人，通常气氛都很有趣。**联邦公开市场委员会**（FOMC: Federal Open Market Committee，美联储的货币政策制定机构）会议本身则更加正式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The presidents get together pretty frequently. The presidents of the reserve banks get together pretty frequently. We have a conference of presidents. There are a whole bunch of operational things that we have to do and we're a quirky bunch and is usually the vibe is pretty fun from that. The FOMC meeting itself is much more formal</p>
</details>

**Austan Goolsbee:** 告诉你气氛如何可能属于秘密信息。如果会议纪要中没有说明气氛如何，那可能就不应该表达出来，如果它要表达出来，也有一个正常的表达方式。

<details>

<p class="english-text">and it's probably secret information for me to tell you what the vibes are. If it's not stated in the minutes what the vibes are probably not supposed there's a normal way for that to be expressed if it was going to be expressed.</p>

### 播客总结：利率前景与通胀风险

**Tracy Alloway:** 特蕾西，利率削减问题远未解决，这确实令人震惊。不，一点也没有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tracy, it really is pretty striking the degree to which it feels like the rate cut question is not settled at all. No, not at all.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 一点也没有。在这一点上，我的意思是，我想我们必须与更多的美联储主席交谈，但市场似乎确实有点超前于预期。再说一次，我们是在8月21日星期四录制这期节目的，明天我们将听到鲍威尔的讲话。所以，谁知道他会说什么。也许市场会在那之后重新调整预期。但你确实听到了很多令人信服的论点，说明为什么你应该忽略像疲软的就业报告这样的事情，对吗？我非常非常喜欢“真相四骑士”这个概念，以及在人口衡量指标波动时期，你需要关注比率这个想法。我会记住这一点，奥斯坦在那里非常清晰地阐述了这一点。所以像职位空缺率、招聘率、裁员率，这些是当人口水平波动时，能够给我们提供清晰信号的指标。鲍威尔在上次会议后的问答环节中也提出了类似的论点，对吗？他是不是说他正在关注失业率，因为他认为在这些变化时期，失业率更有意义？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Not at all. And at this point, I mean, I guess we have to talk to more Fed presidents, but it does seem like maybe the market has gotten a little ahead of itself in terms of expectations. Again, we're recording this on Thursday, August 21st, and we're going to get the PAL speech tomorrow. So, who knows what he's going to say. Maybe markets will recalibrate their expectations after that. But you do hear a lot of convincing arguments for why you should look through things like weaker payrolls, right? I really really liked the four horsemen of truth and this idea that in the time of volatile population measures you want to look at rates. I'm going to I'm going to like remember that that it was very clearly articulated by Austin there. So like vacancy rates, hiring rates, firing rates, these are the things that actually give us clean signal across the cycle when population levels are in flux. Well, Pal made a similar argument in the questions after the last meeting, right? Didn't he say like he's looking at the unemployment rate because he thinks that's more meaningful at a time when you are having these changes?</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的。不，我确实认为，嗯，我必须，我必须真正接受这一点。是的，我必须内化这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. No, I I do think um I have to I have to actually take that. Yes, I have to internalize this a little.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我可能是在幻听鲍威尔的声明，因为那一直保持在相当低的水平，我认为这很重要。但我喜欢奥斯坦的观点，就像他最后说的，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I could be hallucinating statements from Pal because that's been has remained fairly low and I think that's important. But I like Austin's point is like that he said at the end</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 如果你不能以某种方式将服务业通胀与关税联系起来，那甚至就像我们没有一个好的解释一样，如果你有一个好的解释，那是一回事，但这种想法就像，如果这只是那块没有熄灭的余烬呢？你把烟头扔进垃圾桶什么的，然后那里有一点火花，或者那一点点更不祥。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that if you can't tie sort of the services inflation in some way to the tariff that's even like the fact that we don't have a good story for it like if you have a good story for it that's one thing but this idea that's like well what if this is just that ember that didn't go out you like throw a cigarette in the trash or whatever and there's that little spark or that like that is a little bit more ominous.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 是的。我确实认为起始水平在这里很重要。所以，你必须记住，美联储在过去三年一直在对抗通胀。它仍然没有降到2%。每个人都对更高的物价心存芥蒂。我们所有人都已经经历过这一点。所以，担忧是，提高物价和容忍更高物价的冲动比以前更高了。我认为这很重要。可能没有得到足够的讨论。好了。我们就在这里结束吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And I do think like the starting level is important here. So, you have to remember the Fed spent the past 3 years fighting inflation. It's still not down to 2%. And everyone has higher prices on their minds. Like, we've all experienced it at this point. And so, the concern is that like the impulse to raise prices and tolerate more high prices is uh is higher than it once was. I think that's important. It doesn't get discussed enough potentially. All right. Shall we leave it there?</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 就在这里结束吧。
