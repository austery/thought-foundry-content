### 核军控的现状

**主持人**: 还有 85 秒。不是实时。我指的是末日钟。它由《原子科学家公报》于 1947 年设立，旨在说明我们离毁灭世界有多近。而根据今年的调整，我们从未离午夜如此之近。时钟现在考虑了气候变化和人工智能等因素，但核武器仍然是一个关键的担忧，而且有充分的理由。约翰·伍尔斯顿是《原子科学家公报》科学与安全委员会的成员，他谈到了核扩散问题。

**Host**: We've got 85 seconds to go. Not in real time. I'm talking about the Doomsday Clock. It was established by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in 1947, to illustrate how close we are to destroying the world. And as of this year's change, we've never been closer to midnight. The clock now takes into account factors like climate change and AI, but nuclear weapons remain a key concern, and for good reason. Here's John Woolston, a member of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Science and Security Board, talking about nuclear proliferation.

</details>

**约翰·伍尔斯顿 (推测)**: 下降的趋势已经停止，我们现在正看到增长再次开始。全球军备竞赛的可能性就在我们眼前。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Woolston (implied)**: The decline has stopped, and we're now seeing the growth begin again. And the potential for a worldwide arms race is upon us.

**主持人**: 本月，美国和俄罗斯之间最后的核军控条约《新削减战略武器条约》到期。据报道，美国本周分别与俄罗斯和中国在日内瓦会晤，讨论新的军备限制谈判的可能性。这会是一条新的前进道路吗？还是我们正目睹核裁军的终结？我们将审视新的全球格局，加拿大所处的地位，以及我们是否对核战争的威胁足够担忧。然后，我们将追溯安大略省的铀矿开采历史，这段历史可以追溯到曼哈顿计划，并涉及繁荣、萧条和大量的戏剧性事件。欢迎来到《The Rundown》。自 1972 年以来，美国和俄罗斯对其核武库一直有限制。现在情况已非如此。新的《削减战略武器条约》本月早些时候到期。这发生在中东关于伊朗核计划的持续谈判之际，同时主要大国正在测试新形式的武器，而不安的西方盟友正在考虑发展自己的核选择，我们是否正朝着新的全球军备竞赛狂奔？这对加拿大意味着什么？乔治·珀科维奇是卡内基国际和平基金会核政策项目的资深研究员。马特·科尔达是美国科学家联合会核信息项目的副主任，珍妮丝·斯坦是多伦多大学冲突管理领域的贝尔兹伯格教授，也是多伦多大学蒙克全球事务学院的创始主任。欢迎三位来到《The Rundown》。很高兴你们能来。我想先问乔治。新的《削减战略武器条约》涵盖了哪些内容？为什么它会在今年 2 月失效？

**Host**: Just this month, new START, the last nuclear arms control treaty between the United States and Russia expired. The US reportedly met with Russia and China in Geneva separately this week to discuss the potential for new arms limitation talks. Could that be a new path forward, or are we seeing the end of nuclear disarmament? We look at the new global state of play, where Canada stands, and whether we're worried enough about the threat of nuclear war. Then we trace the history of uranium mining in Ontario, which stretches back to the Manhattan Project and involves booms, busts and a whole lot of drama. Welcome to The Rundown. Since 1972, the United States and Russia have had their restrictions on their nuclear arsenals. That's not the case anymore. The new START treaty ended earlier this month. That comes amid ongoing talks about Iran's nuclear program and as major powers are testing new forms of weaponry and uneasy Western allies are considering developing their own nuclear options, are we hurdling toward a new global arms race? And what would that mean for Canada? George Perkovich is a senior fellow in the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace nuclear policy program. Matt Korda is the associate director for the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, and Janice Stein is the Belzberg Professor of Conflict Management at the University of Toronto and the founding director of U of T's Munk School of Global Affairs. Welcome all three of you to the rundown. Great to have you here. I want to start off with George. What did the new START treaty cover and why was it allowed to expire in February of this year?

</details>

### 新 START 条约的到期与影响

**乔治·珀科维奇**: 嗯，这项条约，就像其前身一样，涵盖了你可以称之为远程核武器的范畴。它们被称为战略核武器。但基本上，这些是美国和俄罗斯拥有的核武器，能够打击对方的本土。好的。它限制了这些武器的发射器数量。所以有多少导弹，有多少轰炸机可以携带这些武器？然后根据计数规则，它将它们限制在每种 1550 枚。它在两周前到期，部分原因是双方在军备控制方面都已筋疲力尽，而且还有乌克兰战争，所以他们未能，在乌克兰战争期间同意延长它。美国一直坚持认为，因为中国正在迅速发展其核力量，中国应该被纳入任何未来的战略军备控制协议，这也有一定道理。另外，我想说的最后一件事是，新的《削减战略武器条约》，就像其前身一样，并未涵盖所谓的战术或短程战场核武器。由于俄罗斯在欧洲可能拥有 2000 枚此类武器，政府和其他方面表示，这些武器现在应该被纳入未来。这非常难以做到。所以没有达成协议。一切就此作罢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**George Perkovich**: Well, the treaty, like its predecessors, covered what you could think of as long-range nuclear weapons. They're called strategic nuclear weapons. But basically, these are the nuclear weapons that the United States and Russia have, which can hit each other's homeland. All right. And it limited the number of the launchers of those weapons. So how many missiles, how many bomber planes could carry those weapons? And then by the counting rules, it limited them to 1550 each. It expired two weeks ago, in part because both sides ran out of gas on arms control and also the Ukraine war, so they weren't able to, during the Ukraine war to agree to extend it. The United States has been insisting with some reason that because China is rapidly building up its nuclear forces, China should be brought into any future strategic arms control agreement. And also, last thing I'd say is that the new START treaty, like its predecessors, did not cover what are called tactical or short-range battlefield nuclear weapons. And since Russia has perhaps 2000 of those in Europe, the administration and others were saying those weapons should now be included in the future. That's very hard to do. And so there was no agreement. So everything just lapsed.

</details>

**珍妮丝·斯坦**: 珍妮丝，剩余的核相关条约有多安全？你知道，主要是指 1970 年的《不扩散条约》和 1996 年的《全面禁止核试验条约》。这些条约会因此被搁置吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janice Stein**: Janice, how safe are the remaining nuclear-related treaties? You know, namely, we've got the 1970 Non-Proliferation Treaty, the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Could these fall to the wayside?

</details>

**乔治·珀科维奇**: 嗯，正如乔治刚才所说，人们对中国的核计划非常担忧，我们称之为“三体问题”。要用最少的核武器来生存第一次打击并有足够的力量进行报复，这是容易建模的。这一直是支撑我们任何核稳定的基础。用两个国家进行这种建模比用三个国家容易。如果你只考虑这一点，那是因为你进入了动态分析：如果这两个国家针对那一个国家采取行动会怎样？这坦率地说会造成各种各样的困境。所以关于禁试条约，存在一些漏洞。我想说，乔治，我不知道如何从现任政府的角度来描述，中国进行了一次地下核试验而未通知，并且它正在测试一项先进技术。如果发生全面核军备竞赛，核禁试条约将非常、非常难以长期维持。毫无疑问。毫无疑问，《不扩散条约》正面临风险，不是因为中国、俄罗斯和美国之间在互相做什么，而是因为他们各自在其邻国正在做什么。对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**George Perkovich**: Well, as George was just saying, there is a lot of concern about China's nuclear program, and we call that the three-body problem. It's easy, easier to model with the minimum you need to survive a first strike and have enough to retaliate. That's been the underpinning of whatever nuclear stability we have. It's easier to do that modeling with two than it is with three. And if you just think about that, that's because you get into the dynamics of, well, what happens if these two apply against that one? And that creates all kinds of dilemmas, frankly. So the test ban treaty, there are leaks. I would say, George, I don't know how else to describe it from the current government that China conducted an underground nuclear test without notifying and that it was testing an advanced technology. If there is an all-out nuclear arms race, a nuclear test ban will be very, very difficult to maintain over time. There's no question. There's no question the Non-Proliferation Treaty is at risk, not because of what China and Russia and the United States are doing to each other, but because of what each of them is doing in their neighborhoods. Right.

### 全球核武库概览与新技术

**主持人**: 好的。说到这里，让我们根据美国科学家联合会的数据，看看世界核武装国家的武器库存。这是一张条形图。你会看到蓝色代表储备，橙赭色代表已部署的战略武器。现在这些是估计总数：俄罗斯 4309 枚。美国 3600 枚，中国 600 枚，法国 290 枚。英国 225 枚，印度 180 枚，巴基斯坦 170 枚，以色列 90 枚，朝鲜 50 枚。马特。这些国家中哪些对核不扩散感兴趣？哪些最有可能增加其武库并可能开发新技术？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. With that being said, let's have a look at the weapons inventories of the world's nuclear-armed nations, according to the Federation of American Scientists. So this is a bar graph here. You will see in blue reserve and in orange ochre colour deployed strategic. Now these are the total estimates Russia with 4309. The US with 3600, China with 600, France with 290. The UK 225, India 180, Pakistan 170, Israel with 90 and North Korea with 50. Matt. Which of these nations are interested in nuclear non-proliferation and which are most likely to say, increase their arsenal and develop perhaps new technologies?

</details>

**马特·科尔达**: 是的。你知道，重要的是要认识到，美国和俄罗斯拥有世界上约 90% 的核武器，但这个比例正在缩小。这并不是因为这些库存正在减少，而是因为相反的原因。对。其他国家正在增加它们的库存，因此它们构成了核大饼中更大的一部分。所以你提到了中国、英国、法国、印度、巴基斯坦等国家，其中许多国家都在增加其核武器库存数量。其他国家正在增加那些武器系统的技术能力，还有些国家两者都在做。实际上，没有哪个核武装国家正处于裁军过程或接近裁军过程。我们真正看到的是，所有这些国家都在进行极其昂贵和广泛的现代化改造，其目的是在未来 50、60、70 年，甚至可能在我们有生之年，继续保留核武器。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Matt Korda**: Yeah. You know, what's important to recognize is that the United States and Russia have about 90% of all nuclear weapons in the world, but that percentage is shrinking. And it's not because those stockpiles are getting any smaller, but it's actually because of the opposite. Right. Other countries are building up their stockpiles, and so they're constituting a larger portion of that sort of overall nuclear pie. And so you mentioned countries like China, the UK, France, India, Pakistan, many of these countries are increasing the numbers of nuclear weapons that they have in their stockpiles. Others are increasing sort of the technological capabilities of those weapon systems and others are doing both. There is really no nuclear-armed country that is in the process or anywhere close really, to the process of disarmament. Really what we're looking at is that all these countries are embarking on these incredibly expensive and extensive modernization campaigns that are designed to really keep nuclear weapons in their arsenals for the next, you know, 50, 60, 70 years, really probably for the remainder of our lifetimes.

</details>

**主持人**: 乔治，我希望你能补充一下。你能告诉我们一些关于新技术的信息吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: George, I'm hoping you can add on to that. What can you tell us a bit about some of the new technologies?

</details>

**马特·科尔达**: 嗯，马特说得很好。例如，俄罗斯有五种新的武器运载系统，能够打击到美国。它这样做是为了绕过美国可能部署的任何导弹防御系统来拦截这些武器。所以有一个巨大的鱼雷，可以潜入水下一直到达美国海岸并引爆一个巨大的核弹头。有一种核动力巡航导弹，巡航导弹。你可以引导和机动，所以你可以使其更难被拦截。俄罗斯正在建造一种由小型核反应堆驱动的导弹，使其几乎可以无限期地停留在空中。还有其他几种，都旨在绕过导弹防御。因为美国退出了可以说是最重要的条约，即 1972 年的《反弹道导弹条约》。2002 年，美国退出了该条约，然后俄罗斯表示，好吧，我们将找到一种方法来应对你们在导弹防御方面的任何举动。中国正在显著增加其远程武器的数量以及这些武器的技术复杂性。人们也认为他们不解释，但他们应该解释，但人们认为这是为了确保它能够击败任何美国的导弹防御，并能在任何类型的进攻性攻击，美国对中国这个较小力量的先发制人攻击中幸存下来。所以这是那两个。朝鲜也在做类似的事情，试图拥有能够可靠打击美国的导弹，以阻止美国首先攻击朝鲜。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Matt Korda**: Well, Matt said it well. So Russia, for example, has five new delivery systems of weapons to be able to hit as far as the United States. And it's doing that to be able to bypass any possible missile defenses that the US might put up to intercept those weapons. So there's a giant torpedo that could go underwater all the way to the coast of the United States and blow up a massive nuclear warhead. There is a nuclear-powered cruise missile, cruise missiles. You can guide and maneuver, so you can make it much harder to intercept them. Russia is building one powered by a small nuclear reactor so that it could stay in the air almost indefinitely. There are several others, all designed to bypass missile defense. Because the US withdrew from the most important treaty, arguably, which was the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. In 2002, the US withdrew from that, and Russia then said, all right, we'll find a way to work around whatever you do on missile defense. China is adding the number significantly of its long-range weapons and also the technical sophistication of those. And it's also believed they don't explain and they should explain, but it's believed that two is to be able to ensure it could beat any US missile defense and also survive any kind of offensive attack, offensive first strike by the US against this smaller Chinese force. And so that's those two. And North Korea is doing something similar, trying to have missiles that could reliably hit the United States to deter the United States from hitting North Korea first.

</details>

**主持人**: 马特，非常快速地，我想跟进一下。美国的“金穹”导弹提案会受到潜在核对手的怎样的回应？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Matt, very quickly, I want to follow up. How would the US's Golden Dome missile proposal be met by potential nuclear rivals?

</details>

**马特·科尔达**: 是的。所以，你知道，正如乔治提到的，我们有了一个蓝图，说明一个国家将如何应对一个核武装国家建立的非常复杂的导弹防御体系。所以，在 2002 年，美国退出了《反弹道导弹条约》。当时，包括俄罗斯和中国在内的几个国家都表示担忧，他们回应说，你知道，如果，如果，如果导弹防御和核威慑，对吧？如果这两件事是我们核稳定的核心，对吧？没有防御，并拥有这种相互脆弱性。如果你剥夺了导弹防御的这一方面，那么我们就必须做出回应。对吧？所以，如果各国开始建立防御，其他国家将不得不建立专门用于规避这些防御的系统。所以，你知道，建立一个武器系统需要很长时间。但如果你快进到，你知道，十年、十五年后，这就是为什么我们看到俄罗斯、中国和其他国家开始建立这些系统，这些系统专门设计用于抵消它们看到的任何其他国家通过部署先进导弹防御系统可能获得的优势。对。这并不是这些国家制造这些东西的唯一原因。还有很多其他因素，国内原因，你知道，货币原因，诸如此类。但先进导弹防御的发展无疑是一个重要的因素。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Matt Korda**: Yeah. So, you know, as George mentioned, we sort of have a blueprint for how a country is going to respond to a really complex missile defense architecture that gets instituted by a nuclear-armed state. So in 2002, the United States pulled out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. And at the time, there was a lot of concern from several countries, including Russia and China, where they kind of responded and they said, you know, if, if, if missile defense and nuclear deterrence, right? If these two things are sort of at the core of what we consider to be nuclear stability, right? Not having defenses and having this sort of mutual vulnerability. And if you take away that aspect of missile defense, then we're going to have to respond. Right? And so if countries start building up their defenses, other countries are going to have to build systems that are designed specifically to circumvent those defenses. And so, you know, it takes a long time to build up a weapon system. But if you fast forward, you know, ten, 15 years later, this is why we're seeing Russia and China and other countries to start to build up these systems that are specifically designed to offset any perceived advantage that they can see another country getting by deploying advanced missile defenses. Right. That's not the only reason why those countries are building those things. There's a whole host of other factors domestic reasons, you know, monetary reasons, things like that. But the development of advanced missile defenses is certainly a big one.

</details>

**珍妮丝·斯坦**: 加拿大几十年来一直倡导和平利用核武器和技术。50 年前，加拿大是《不扩散条约》的首批签署国之一。我很好奇，加拿大参与“金穹”提案是否会破坏其所有这些工作和遗产？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janice Stein**: Canada has spent decades advocating for the peaceful use of nuclear weapons and technology. Canada was one of the first signatories to the Non-Proliferation Treaty 50 years ago. I am curious, would Canada's participation in the Golden Dome proposal undermine all that work in its legacy?

</details>

**珍妮丝·斯坦**: 会破坏《不扩散条约》吗？不会，因为我们不会成为扩散者。对。真正的问题是，正如马特和乔治所说，在你改进导弹防御、来袭导弹的防御能力时，你实际上是在激励各国开发越来越强大的导弹。然而，弹道导弹防御，正如刚才所说，不仅仅是针对其他核大国，它也是针对那些日益拥有非常先进的弹道导弹技术和高超音速导弹技术、但非核的国家。所以，从技术上讲，我们对“金穹”的了解还不够。坦率地说，其具体细节还没有真正严肃地公布。我看到你笑了。但根据目前的描述，从这个角度来看，我们不会是违约者。至于是否明智，那是完全不同的讨论，但我们不会正式违约。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janice Stein**: Would it undermine the Non-Proliferation Treaty? No, because we would not be a proliferator. Right. The the issue really is as as Matt and George have said, that to the extent that you improve defense against missiles, incoming missiles, you actually incentivize powers to develop more and more powerful missiles. It is also true, though, that ballistic missile defense, as not just said, is not only aimed at other nuclear powers, it is aimed at states that are increasingly the owners of very sophisticated ballistic missile technology and hypersonic missile technology, which non-nuclear. So, technically speaking, and we don't know enough about the Golden Dome yet. Frankly, the specs are not there in a really serious way. And I see your smiling there. But as it is currently described, we would not be a violator from that perspective. Whether it's wise, that's a wholly different discussion, but we would not formally be a violent.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的，乔治。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right, George.

</details>

**乔治·珀科维奇**: 嗯，我认为珍妮丝说得对。我的意思是，我认为从《不扩散条约》的角度来看，导弹防御并不是一个至关重要的问题。除非，正如她所说，它促使人们增加而不是减少其核力量，我认为更大的问题将是，如果加拿大或其他美国盟友开始开发选项来制造与导弹防御不同的核武器，那将是对《不扩散条约》的重大挑战。而且，有时在韩国、波兰，也许在加拿大，会有人讨论，因为美国在这方面变得不可靠，人们可能需要对冲他们的赌注。所以这对《不扩散条约》是一个担忧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**George Perkovich**: Well, I think Janice is right. I mean, I think from the Non-Proliferation Treaty point of view, the missile defense is isn't such a vital issue. Except, as she said, if it drives people to build up rather than to reduce their nuclear forces, I think the the bigger question would be if if Canada or other US allies started developing options to make nuclear weapons so different from missile defense, but nuclear weapons, that would be a big challenge to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. And there's some discussion in South Korea once in a while in Poland, perhaps in Canada, that because the US has become unreliable in this regard, people may need to hedge their bets. And so that that is a concern about the Non-Proliferation Treaty.

</details>

**马特·科尔达**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Matt Korda**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 确实。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Really.

</details>

**马特·科尔达**: 确实令人震惊。乔治的评论，听欧洲关于独立核威慑的讨论，确实令人震惊。这不仅来自两个核大国，还来自像德国这样的国家。所以，这确实是一个与我们过去 75 年在欧洲听到的完全不同的讨论。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Matt Korda**: Really is striking. Just just to follow on George's comment, it really is striking to listen to the discussion in Europe about an independent nuclear deterrent. And it's coming not only from the two nuclear powers, but from a country like Germany. So this is a this is a discussion of an entirely different order than we've heard out of Europe, really, in the last 75 years.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么，让我们来探讨一下“新秩序”这个想法。马特，世界是否已经忘记了如何就核武器进行谈判，或者它是否根本不感兴趣？考虑到事物发生了一些变化？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Well, let's pick up upon that idea of New Order here. Matt, has the world forgotten how to negotiate regarding nuclear weapons, or is it simply not interested in it? Seeing how things have changed a bit?

</details>

**马特·科尔达**: 是的。你知道，我们甚至在讨论各国可能建造自己核武器的想法，这确实象征着世界发生了多么大的变化，对吧？以及这带来了多少损害，你知道，特别是特朗普政府在如此短的时间内对全球不扩散和军备控制事业造成的损害。但这不仅仅是特朗普政府的责任，对吧？还有其他核武装国家，你知道，正在对邻国行使日益增长的帝国野心。对吧？尤其是俄罗斯。但是，你知道，我也把联合国、美国也包括在内，对吧？关于加拿大和格陵兰以及类似的事情。所以我们看到，你知道，军备控制谈判的时代以及各国努力坐在一起，从彼此那里寻找价值，通过对话解决分歧，解决军备控制的分歧。那个时代正在逐渐过去。我们看到的是，各国更感兴趣的是“点名和羞辱”他们潜在的军备控制伙伴，而不是真正试图为否则就非常不可预测的关系注入一种可预测性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Matt Korda**: Yeah. You know, the fact that we're even having this discussion about the idea of countries potentially building their own nuclear weapons is really emblematic of how much the world has changed, right? And how much damage that for, you know, in particular, the Trump administration has done in such a short time to the global cause of non-proliferation and arms control. But it's not just the Trump administration, right? There are other nuclear-armed states that are really, you know, sort of exercising increasingly imperial ambitions against their neighbors. Right? Russia in particular. But the, you know, I also lump the UN, the, the US in that as well, right? With regards to Canada and Greenland and things like that. And so we're seeing that, you know, increasingly this era of, of arms control negotiations and countries really sort of making an effort to sit around the table from each other, finding value in talking through differences and resolving differences in arms control. That era is is increasingly over. And what we're seeing is that countries are much more interested in sort of naming and shaming their prospective arms control partners than actually trying to inject a sense of predictability into an otherwise quite, quite unpredictable relationship.

</details>

**主持人**: 珍妮丝，我想听听你的看法。但是，你知道，马特谈到了围坐在桌旁。其中一部分是建立一些信任。我想帮助理解，这个概念在理解和谈判这些协议方面有多重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Janice, I want to get your take on that. But, you know, Matt talks about sitting around that table. Part of that is having some trust. And I want to help understand how much is that concept important in sort of understanding and negotiating some of these deals?

</details>

**珍妮丝·斯坦**: 好的。嗯，你把它当作一种粘合剂，几乎让一切成为可能。但是，你知道，从古巴导弹危机之后开始，美国和苏联来到谈判桌时，信任度并不高。你与对手谈判。你不仅仅与朋友谈判，你实际上是通过谈判过程建立信任。我认为不应该将其作为先决条件。那样我们会错过很多机会。不幸的是，我想说，在过去的几年里，我们已经挖空了信任的储备，并且严重耗尽了它。你知道，俄罗斯打破了欧洲的一个准则，那就是你不能侵犯你的邻国。欧洲人认为这在他们过去的时代就已经远远落后了。这是一个非常粗鲁的冲击。而特朗普政府，我可以告诉你，作为一个加拿大人，特朗普政府给非常亲密的盟友带来了粗鲁的冲击。所以我们削弱了信任。当你处于信任的下坡路时，要启动一个谈判进程比在上升期要困难得多，我认为，这就是为什么我们看到现在的情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janice Stein**: Okay. Well, you just as a glue that makes almost everything possible. But, you know, beginning really after the Cuban Missile Crisis, the United States, Soviet Union came to the table with not a very high degree of trust. And you negotiate with your adversaries. You don't only negotiate with your friends, and you actually build that trust through the negotiation process. I don't think it's right to make it a requisite. We will miss a lot of opportunities that way. Unfortunately, I would say we have dug into the stockpile of trust over the last several years and depleted it very badly. You know, in Russia broke a norm in Europe, which is you don't invade your neighbor. Europeans thought that was way behind them in their past. It was very rude shock. And the Trump administration, I could tell you as a Canadian, the Trump administration has been a rude shock to very close allies. So we have diminished trust. And when you're on the downward slope of trust, it's harder to get a negotiation process going than when you're on the upside, I think, and that's why we're seeing what we're seeing.

</details>

**主持人**: 乔治，要让包括中国在内的大国重返谈判桌，需要做些什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: George, what would it take to get major powers, China included, back to the negotiating table?

</details>

**乔治·珀科维奇**: 是的，我只是接续珍妮丝的话说，我认为她说的很对，你不能带着信任开始谈判。如果你有成功或至少有希望的谈判，你就会建立信任。我想补充一点来回答你的问题，这必须从最高领导人开始。过去，当它奏效时，是美国或苏联或俄罗斯的国家元首，直接或秘密地，通常是相互沟通，说，看，我不喜欢事情的发展方向。我们应该改变它。或者任命一位特使，他们是对方知道的联络人，好的，和他们谈谈。他们代表总统或总书记发言。我认为，这是摆脱当前困境的唯一途径。普京总统和习近平主席，特朗普总统是否会在某个时候相互沟通？好的。我们得把这件事弄上正轨。我将指定这个人与你的对应方交谈。这可能需要秘密进行，我碰巧认为这是一件好事，可能会有争议，但我看不到它会发生，尤其是在美国现在通过任何公开对话的情况下，因为它会变得太混乱，而且，而且，而且难以管理。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**George Perkovich**: Yeah, I just picking up upon what Janice said, which I think was was right on that you that you don't start negotiations with trust. You build trust if you have successful or at least promising negotiations. And I would just add to that to answer your question, it has to start with the top leaders. And in the past when it worked, it was the head of state of the United States or the Soviet Union or Russia, either directly and secretly, usually communicating with each other, saying, look, I don't like where things are headed. We should change it. Or appointing a special emissary that their go to person that the other side knew, okay, talk to them. They speak for the president or they speak for the general secretary. And that, I think, is the only way out of the current predicament. Is it at some point does President Putin and does President Xi, does President Trump communicate with each other? All right. We got to get this on track. And I'm designating this person to talk to your counterpart. And this would probably need to be in secret, which I happen to think is a good thing can be controversial, but I don't see it happening, especially with the United States now through any kind of open dialogue, because it just gets too spun out and, and, and unmanageable.

</details>

**主持人**: 马特，我想让你加入进来。珍妮丝提到了古巴导弹危机。对很多人来说，那可以说是世界最接近核战争的时刻。我很想知道，今天我们离核战争的边缘还有多远或多近？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Matt, I want to get you in here. Janice had mentioned the Cuban Missile Crisis. For a lot of people, it said that's the closest the world has ever come to nuclear war. And I am curious how far or close to the brink of nuclear war are we today?

</details>

**马特·科尔达**: 你知道，我认为很重要的一点是，珍妮丝在开头也提到了，你知道，当我们想到冷战时期的危机时，对吧？美国和苏联，这两个主要的核超级大国，导弹互相瞄准。对。那是一个极其危险的局面。但今天不同的是，你不仅仅只有这两个国家，对吧？你有九个核武装国家。它们之间都有相互关联的威慑关系。所以，你知道，一场只涉及两个国家的危机几乎肯定，你知道，可能会失控并涉及这两个国家以外的其他国家。所以，例如，美国可能想建立一个新的武器系统来应对俄罗斯正在做的事情。对。但考虑到美中之间的紧张关系，中国又该如何反应呢？对吧？然后，如果中国做出反应，对吧？中国和印度之间存在一种持续的边境冲突。他们最近一次发生枪战是在 2021 年，对吧？考虑到印度和巴基斯坦之间历史上的紧张关系，巴基斯坦又该如何应对印度所做的事情呢？所以这就像多米诺骨牌效应一样。你可以很容易地想象，一场可能只始于两个国家的危机，会迅速升级到三个，甚至四个国家。

**Matt Korda**: You know, I think what's really important to note, and Janice mentioned this up top, is that, you know, when we think about crises during the Cold War, right? The US and the Soviet Union, these two major nuclear superpowers with missiles pointed at each other. Right. That was an incredibly dangerous situation. But what's different about today is that you don't just have these two countries, right? You have nine nuclear-armed states. They all have interlocking deterrence relationships with one another. And so, you know, a crisis that involves just two countries is almost certainly, you know, likely to spin out of control and involve additional countries beyond just those two. And so, for example, the United States may want to build a new weapon system to respond to something that Russia is doing. Right. But then how is China supposed to react to that, given tensions between the US and China? Right. And then if China responds, right, China and India have sort of a simmering border conflict. They engaged in a shooting war as recently as 2021, right. How is Pakistan supposed to respond to what India does given, you know, historic tensions between India and Pakistan? And so this sort of goes in a in a domino effect. And you can really easily imagine how a crisis that starts with potentially just two countries rapidly escalates to maybe three, maybe four.

</details>

**珍妮丝·斯坦**: 我想以乐观的基调来结束，马特。好的。你刚才描述了我之前谈到的“三体效应”，计算变得如此紧张。但这会导致武器的累积。令人着迷的是，尽管他们的本土受到了攻击，核大国并没有用核武器回应。对。我刚写完一篇关于这个的文章。核武器实际上是一个糟糕的赌注。投资回报率不高。伊朗向以色列发射了一系列导弹。它没有威胁、考虑或思考使用核武器。乌克兰回应了俄罗斯的恶毒攻击，俄罗斯谈到了使用战术核武器。在中国和印度，应拜登总统的要求，他们对此表示反对。就这样。战争已经持续了四年多，比第二次世界大战还长，他们没有使用核武器。印度和巴基斯坦自那时以来已经打了三场战争。他们双方都有二次打击能力。双方都没有威胁使用核武器。所以仍然有一条线在这里，非常、非常、非常难以跨越。尽管有所有这些相互关联的影响，我认为我们应该区分“制造它们”和“使用它们”。这是两个不同的领域。

**Janice Stein**: You know, I just want with an optimistic note here, Matt. Okay. You just described what I was talking about earlier, the three-body effect where the calculations get so tight. But that leads to accumulation of weapons. It's really fascinating that even though their homelands have been attacked, nuclear powers have not responded with nuclear weapons. Right. And I've just finished a piece at that. Nuclear weapons are actually a bad bet. There's not very much return on investment. Iran fired a, you know, a barrage of missiles at Israel. It did not threaten or contemplate or think about using nuclear weapons. Ukraine responded to a vicious attack by Russia, and the Russians talked about using tactical nuclear weapons. The Chinese and the Indians, at the request of President Biden, spoke out against it. That was it. And the war has been going on for more than four years, longer than World War II, and they have not used nuclear weapons. India and Pakistan have fought three wars since. Each of them have a second strike capability. Neither side has threatened to use nuclear weapons. So there is still a line here that is very, very, very difficult to cross. Despite all these interlocking effects, I think we want to distinguish between building them up and using them. Those are two separate universes.

**乔治·珀科维奇**: 我很乐观。

**George Perkovich**: I'm optimistic.

</details>

**主持人**: 乔治，我要让你加入进来。正如我们注意到的，你知道，美国袭击了伊拉克，北约袭击了利比亚。伊朗现在正受到美国军事行动的威胁。像这样的事件在说服非核国家考虑探索这些选择方面有多重要？也许，正如珍妮特所说，正在发展壮大？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: George, I'm going to get you in there. As we noted, you know, the US has a has attacked Iraq, NATO attacked Libya. Iran is now being threatened with US military action. How significant are events like this in swaying non-nuclear nations in considering exploring these options? And perhaps, as Janet said, building building it up?

</details>

**乔治·珀科维奇**: 嗯，我认为这取决于双方。我认为有一种冲动，或者想象如果我们拥有核武器，这种情况就不会发生，如果我们是伊拉克、利比亚等国。所以旁观者会看着说，天哪，他们应该拥有核武器，也许我们也应该这样做。结果发现获得核武器非常困难。所以我们谈到的每个国家都有一定程度的拥有核武器的野心，但他们被阻止了。所以以色列有标准政策。它对叙利亚这样做了。它对伊拉克这样做了。它对伊朗这样做了。它在别处对人们进行了暗杀。它不允许对手获得核武器。美国也说了同样的话。所以虽然诱人，但你必须回答，好的，我们需要多久才能获得核武器？以及我们在尝试获得它们的时候会发生什么？所以波兰出于非常充分的理由提到了这种可能性，考虑到俄罗斯对乌克兰所做的一切。嗯，你现在很容易想象波兰的工程师和科学家在波兰街头被暗杀，俄罗斯进行破坏行动。如果俄罗斯认为波兰试图获得核武器，你需要多少？如果你要对抗俄罗斯，它拥有你数多少都可以的数千枚武器？所以结果是，无论它是否是一个诱人的想法，在实践中，它会带来比人们轻易能够管理的更多问题。我想说。

<details>

**George Perkovich**: Well, I think it goes both ways. I think there's an impulse or to imagine if we had had nuclear weapons, this wouldn't have happened if we were Iraq, Libya, etc. And so for bystanders to look and say, Jesus, they should have gotten nuclear weapons, maybe we should do that. Turns out it's very hard to get nuclear weapons. So each of those countries that we talk about did have some level of ambition to get nuclear weapons, and they were stopped. So Israel has a standard policy. It's done it with Syria. It's done it with Iraq. It's done it with Iran. It's done assassinations with people elsewhere. It doesn't let an adversary get nuclear weapons. The US has kind of said the same thing. So while it's tempting, you have to answer, okay, how long will it take us to get nuclear weapons? And what happens to us while we're trying to get them? So Poland has mentioned this possibility for very good reason, given what Russia has done to Ukraine. Well, you can readily imagine now Poland's engineers and scientists being assassinated in the streets in in Poland, sabotage operations from Russia. If Russia thought Poland was trying to acquire nuclear weapons, how many do you need? If you're going to go against Russia, which has however many thousands you want to count? So it turns out whether or not it's a seductive idea, in practice, it raises many more problems than than people can readily kind of manage. I would say.

</details>

**珍妮丝·斯坦**: 我完全同意乔治的观点，即走上获取核武器的道路是一个非常危险的过程。伊朗之所以走到今天这个地步，就是因为这个原因。而且，你知道，只是为了强调乔治刚才所说的，对我来说，一个非常令人震惊的事情是，当乌克兰将无人机用平板卡车偷运过俄罗斯边境时。我深入到了，你知道，俄罗斯中部，亚洲部分，并利用这些无人机攻击战略轰炸机，其中一些是用于发射核武器的战略机队的一部分。俄罗斯没有回应。我认为，有最强大的反扩散论点。我看着乔治的说法，我们必须说的是，它们只是糟糕的投资。它们是糟糕的赌注。它们不会成功，它们不会带来回报。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janice Stein**: I completely agree with George that embarking on the path to get a nuclear weapon is a very dangerous process. Iran is where it is today because of that. And, you know, just to underline what George was saying right now, one of the really striking things to me was when Ukraine smuggled drones on flatbed trucks across Russia's border. I went way deep into, you know, the central, the Asian part of Russia and used those drones against strategic bombers, which some of which were part of the strategic fleet to launch nuclear weapons. Russia did not respond. There are, I think, the most powerful anti-proliferation arguments. And I'm looking at George's we say this we have to make is they're just lousy investments. They're bad bets. They're don't do it, they don't pay off.

### 安大略省的铀矿开采历史

**主持人**: 第二次世界大战期间，美国一直在寻找可靠的铀来源。TVO Today 的约翰·迈克尔·麦格拉斯告诉我们接下来的故事以及这一切对安大略省意味着什么。人们主要将铀用于两种目的：制造蒸汽和发电厂，或者制造炸弹。基本上，铀可以用来加热水，或者使空气变得非常、非常、非常热。安大略省的铀矿开采历史可以追溯到 20 世纪 30 年代，充满了秘密、欺骗和阴谋。第二次世界大战期间，美国迫切需要友好的铀来源来供应一项名为“曼哈顿计划”的小项目，该项目将由工程师和物理学家最终建造第一批原子弹。但仅仅获取必要的铀似乎就可能是一个问题。加拿大政府作为战争努力的一部分，将埃尔多拉多矿业公司国有化，并赋予其在该国所有铀矿开采的垄断权。正如发生的那样，希望港是北美唯一军事级铀精炼中心之一的所在地。保密是关键。炼油厂的工人被蒙在鼓里。他们完全不知道他们正在加工的材料被运往美国，以帮助制造第一批核武器。20 世纪 40 年代末，美国再次寻找友好的铀来源，以防冷战升温。几位勘探者确信在安大略省北部埃利奥特湖附近有丰富的矿藏。为了不惊动竞争对手，他们的行动就像一部慢动作惊悚片。工程师、地质学家和勘探者的团队秘密地在这片省北部 56,000 英亩的区域进行勘探，以申请大约 1400 个采矿权。该地区变成了一个繁荣的城镇。埃利奥特湖被建立为一个规划社区，以支持采矿业。到 20 世纪 50 年代末，该地区 4000 人的人口激增至约 25,000 人。它并非孤单。班克罗夫特也成为采矿活动的温床。但繁荣之后是萧条。突然间，美国不再需要大量的铀储备。需求崩溃，埃利奥特湖的人口在接下来的五年里减少了约一半。20 世纪 70 年代，随着西方国家为应对石油危机转向核能，人口有所回升，但随后又下降。埃利奥特湖的最后一个铀矿于 1990 年代中期停止生产。但安大略省的铀矿开采历史给该省留下了两份遗产。一方面，我们继承了一个供应链，它正在为安大略省和全球新一代核能项目做出贡献。另一方面，铀矿的开采和提炼带来了环境成本，包括在埃利奥特湖和希望港，那里的清理成本至今仍在继续，估计超过 10 亿美元。

**Host (segment outro)**: During the Second World War, the Americans were on the lookout for a reliable source of uranium. TVO Today's John Michael McGrath tells us the story of what happened next and what it all meant for Ontario. People mostly use uranium for two purposes to make steam and power plants, or to make bombs. Basically, uranium is good for making water hot or for making the air really, really, really hot. And Ontario has a history of uranium mining going back to the 1930s, one filled with secrecy, subterfuge and intrigue. During World War II, the Americans were desperate for friendly sources of uranium to supply a little thing called the Manhattan Project that sleep away camp for engineers and physicists would eventually build the first atomic bombs. But just getting the necessary uranium looked like it could be a problem. The Canadian government nationalized the mining company El Dorado as part of the war effort, and gave it a monopoly on all uranium mining in the country as it happened. Port Hope was home to one of North America's only military grade uranium refining centres. Secrecy was the name of the game. Workers at the refinery were kept in the dark. They had no idea that the material they were working with was being shipped to the US to help create the first nuclear weapons. In the late 1940s, the US was again in search of friendly sources of uranium in case the Cold War heated up. A few prospectors became convinced of rich deposits near Elliot Lake in northern Ontario. Not wanting to tip off competitors, their campaign played out like a slow motion thriller. Panel loads of engineers, geologists and prospectors surreptitiously fanned over 56,000 acre area in the province's north to stake roughly 1400 mining claims. The area became a boomtown. Elliot Lake was founded as a planned community to support the mining industry. The region's population of 4000 people ballooned to roughly 25,000 by the late 1950s. It wasn't alone. Bancroft two became a hotbed for mining activity. But booms are followed by busts. Suddenly, the Americans no longer wanted big stockpiles of uranium. Demand collapsed and Elliot Lake's population fell by roughly half in the following five years. It picked back up in the 1970s as Western countries turned to nuclear power in response to the oil shocks, but fell again. The last uranium mine in Elliot Lake stopped production in the mid 1990s. But Ontario's history of uranium mining has left the province with a pair of legacies. On the one hand, we've inherited a supply chain that's contributing to the new generation of nuclear power projects, both in Ontario and globally. On the other hand, mining and refining uranium has come with environmental costs, including in Elliot Lake and Port Hope, where cleanup costs continue today and are estimated at more than $1 billion.
