### 移民家庭的恐惧

**Tracy Mumford**: 来自《纽约时报》，这是新闻头条。我是 Tracy Mumford。今天是 2 月 4 日，星期三。我们正在报道：

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Wednesday, February 4th. Here's what we're covering.

</details>

**>>**: 我们代表 Nay 的大家庭以及爱她的人们来到这里。我们来寻求你们的帮助。昨天在国会山，议员们听取了 **Renee Good** 的两位兄弟的证词，她是在上个月于明尼阿波利斯被一名 **ICE** 探员枪杀的妇女。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: We're here on behalf of Nay's big family and those who loved her. We're here to ask for your help. On Capitol Hill yesterday, lawmakers heard testimony from two brothers of Renee Good, the woman shot and killed by an ICE agent in Minneapolis last month.

</details>

**>>**: 这不仅仅是糟糕的一天，或艰难的一周，或孤立的事件。这些与联邦探员的接触正在永远改变许多人的生活，包括我们。他们敦促国会约束**白宫**的强硬移民行动，称 Good 的死亡是一系列探员滥用职权行为的一部分。该活动由国会民主党人组织。当兄弟们发言时，没有共和党人在场。国会就移民执法问题上的分歧曾引发了本周早些时候的政府停摆，该停摆在众议院以微弱优势通过一项支出法案后于昨晚结束。但关于**总统特朗普**移民行动的持续支持问题依然存在。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: This is not just a bad day or a rough week or isolated incident. These encounters with federal agents are changing many lives, including ours, forever. They urged Congress to rein in the White House's aggressive immigration operations, saying Good's death was part of a pattern of abuses from agents. The event was held by congressional Democrats. No Republicans were there when the brothers spoke. Disagreements in Congress over immigration enforcement had triggered a government shutdown earlier this week that ended last night after the House narrowly passed a spending bill. But the question of ongoing support for President Trump's immigration operations, remains.

</details>

**>>**: 议员们只同意为包括 ICE 在内的**国土安全部**提供资金，直至下周。民主党人表示，在他们向该机构提供更多资金之前，必须出台新的限制措施。他们正在推动诸如枪击事件后的强制性独立调查等措施。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: Lawmakers only agreed to fund the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, through next week. Democrats say before they give the agency any more money, there must be new restrictions. They're pushing for things like mandatory independent investigations after shootings.

</details>

**>>**: 与此同时，在明尼苏达州的实地，**《纽约时报》**的记者一直在报道数千名联邦探员的持续存在如何动摇了**双子城**。例如，明尼阿波利斯官员估计，该市每周损失 **2000 万美元**，因为那里的大多数企业，如酒店、餐馆和商店，销售额均有所下降。对迎合移民或依赖移民作为劳动力的企业来说，影响尤为强烈。一位杂货店老板告诉《纽约时报》，他损失了大约一半的员工。他们因为太害怕而不敢来上班。他现在把店门锁着。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: Meanwhile, on the ground in Minnesota, Times reporters have been covering how the continued presence of thousands of federal agents has shaken the Twin Cities. Officials in Minneapolis, for example, estimate the city's been losing $20 million a week as the majority of businesses there, like hotels, restaurants, and stores, have seen sales drop. The impact's been particularly intense on businesses that cater to immigrants or rely on them for staffing. One grocery store owner told the Times he'd lost about half his employees. They were too scared to come into work. He now keeps the front door of the store locked.

</details>

**>>**: 人们，尤其是孩子们，我们的学校，我们有夜间的视频录像显示 ICE 官员在夜间在学校附近走动。今天早上我们收到了报告。他们跟着公交车到孩子们下车的公交车站。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: People and when it comes to children, um, our schools, we've got video footage at night of ICE officers walking around schools in the middle of the night. We had reports this morning. They're following the buses to the bus stops where they let kids off. Um,

</details>

**>>**: 昨天，明尼苏达州州长 **Tim Walls** 表示，ICE 的行动也给该州的儿童带来了沉重打击，他特别担心孩子们会被卷入移民突袭，就像 5 岁的 **Liam Kaneo Ramos** 的引人注目的案例一样，他被拍到穿着他的 **蜘蛛侠背包**，他和他的父亲一起被拘留。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: yesterday, Minnesota Governor Tim Walls said the ICE operations have also taken an intense toll on children in the state, and that he was particularly worried about kids getting swept up in immigration raids, like the high-profile case of 5-year-old Liam Kaneo Ramos, who was photographed wearing his Spider-Man backpack as he and his father were detained.

</details>

**>>**: 我今天给 Christine 写了一封信，要求她就目前有多少儿童被关押在联邦拘留中心、他们在哪里、为什么被带走以及他们的正当程序权利是什么，给出明确的答复。特朗普政府官员否认联邦探员以学校为目标，并表示他们专注于逮捕暴力犯罪分子，但许多家庭仍然处于戒备状态。**《纽约时报》**采访了一位 9 岁孩子的母亲，她现在让儿子在背包里放一份他的**美国护照**副本，另一位妈妈则让她的 8 岁和 15 岁的孩子去明尼阿波利斯郊区的学校时，把护照放在挂在脖子上的透明袋子里。那位 8 岁的孩子告诉《纽约时报》，她仍然担心可能发生的事情，她说：“我有护照，但它只是纸，不是盾牌。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: I sent Christine a letter today demanding clear answers on how many children are currently being held in federal detention centers, where they're at, why they were taken, and what their due process rights are. Trump administration officials have denied that federal agents target schools and said they're focused on arresting violent criminals, but many families are still on edge. The Times talked with the mother of a 9-year-old who's having her son carry a copy of his US passport in his backpack now, and another mom who sends her eight and 15year-old kids to school in the Minneapolis suburbs with their passports in clear pouches hanging around their necks. The 8-year-old told the Times she was still worried about what could happen, saying, quote, "I have a passport, but it's paper, not a shield."

### 美国住房危机

**>>**: 美国人呼吁他们的领导人采取行动解决可负担性问题。住房一直是家庭关心的头等大事之一。在过去的几个月里，在国会山，**共和党人、民主党人和独立人士**都同意住房价格过高、供应不足、监管过多。所以，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: Americans are calling on their leaders to take action on affordability. Housing has consistently been one of the top ranked issues that families care about. For the past few months on Capitol Hill,

</details>

**>>**: 解决美国**住房危机**的跨党派势头一直在增强。美国目前短缺多达 **700 万套住房**，这是过去 5 年房价飙升约 **50%** 的主要原因之一。参议院在秋季批准了一揽子住房重点法案，现在众议院预计最快下周将对类似的一揽子法案进行投票，该法案将奖励新建住房并消除繁文缛节。新立法可能做的一些事情。首先，它可能推动联邦政府制定一项**国家建筑规范**，而美国目前还没有。其想法是，标准化建筑法规和指南，而不是拥有一个由州和地方规则组成的拼凑体系，可以降低成本并简化新开发。此外，两项法案都旨在促进**预制和模块化房屋**。这种住房是在厂外建造，然后运送和组装，比传统建筑快得多。而且这些法案还将使修复现有房屋变得更容易。例如，参议院的法案将向低收入美国人和小型房东提供赠款和贷款，用于进行关键维修，以便旧住房能够继续使用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: bipartisan momentum has been building around starting to tackle America's housing crisis. The US is currently short as many as 7 million housing units, which is one of the big reasons that home prices surged roughly 50% in the last 5 years. The Senate approved a package of housing focused bills in the fall and now the House is expected to vote on a similar package as soon as next week that would reward new construction and eliminate red tape. A few of the things the new legislation could do. First, it could push the federal government towards writing a national building code, which the US doesn't currently have. The thinking is that standardizing construction regulations and guidelines instead of having a patchwork of state and local rules could reduce costs and streamline new development. Also, both bills aim to give a boost to manufactured and modular homes. That kind of housing is built offsite than delivered and assembled, a much faster way to build than traditional construction. And the bills would also make it easier to fix up existing homes. The Senate bill, for example, would give grants and loans to lowincome Americans and small-time landlords to make critical repairs so that older housing can continue to be used.

### 中国军事清洗

**Tracy Mumford**: 我报道**中国政治**已有 20 多年了，在过去的几年里，中国一直有高级军官被正式解职或干脆失踪。但**张又侠**的被免职，中国最高军官的被免职，却是前所未有的。你知道，这是一个惊人的发展。很多人用“**莎士比亚式**”这个词来形容这件事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: I've been covering Chinese politics for over 20 years now, and in the past few years in China, there's been a steady rhythm of senior military officials who have either been officially dismissed or simply disappeared. But there was nothing like the announcement of the removal of Jang Yosha, China's topmost uniformed officer. You know, this is a stunning development. Uh Shakespearean is a word that's been used by a lot of people to describe this.

</details>

**Chris Buckley**: **Chris Buckley** 是《纽约时报》报道中国军方最高层发生大规模清洗的记者团队的一员。这被称为对高级指挥官的“彻底清除”。我的同事们最近分析了国家媒体的报道和官方公告，发现近年来已有 30 名高级将领和海军上将中的 23 名被撤职，包括中国最高将领，他在一周多前被罢免。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Buckley**: Chris Buckley is part of the team of Times reporters covering a remarkable purge at the highest levels of the Chinese military. It's been called a total annihilation of the high command. My colleagues recently analyzed state media reports and official announcements and found that 23 out of 30 highranking generals and admirals have been removed from their posts in recent years, including China's top general who was ousted just over a week ago.

</details>

**Chris Buckley**: **习近平**治下的**中国政治**是一个黑箱。要从习近平最核心的圈子里获得可靠信息极其困难。尽管如此，我们确实知道中国的军事报纸曾对**张又侠**提出了一些广泛的指控。其中之一是**腐败**。另一个是对习近平的广泛指控，即**不忠**。现在，腐败的指控在过去几十年中国军队的背景下更容易理解。它已经成为一个臭名昭著的腐败机构。更难弄清楚的是，当他们说张又侠，似乎是习近平最忠诚的将领之一，也参与了某种形式的背叛行为时，他们指的是什么。这是对**共产党**权力原则的某种背叛。这一点更难理解，但我们目前看到的是，中国的高级指挥官似乎不仅没有为战争挑战做好准备，而且根本就不在那里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Buckley**: Chinese politics under Xi Jinping is a black box. It's extremely difficult to get reliable information from the innermost circle of Xi Jinping. Nonetheless, we do know that the Chinese military newspapers have come out with a few broad accusations against Jungy Sha. One of them is corruption. The other one is a broad accusation of disloyalty against Xi Jinping. Now, the corruption allegation is a bit easier to understand in the context of the Chinese military over the past few decades. It has become a notoriously corrupt institution. The more difficult charge to figure out is what they're meaning when they're saying that Jung Sha, who seemed to be one of Xi Jinping's most loyal generals, was also involved in some sort of act of disloyalty against him, some betrayal of the principles of power within the Communist Party. That's harder to get at, but what we're seeing at the moment is a Chinese high command that seems not simply unprepared for the challenges of war, but simply not there.

</details>

**>>**: 美国官员告诉《纽约时报》，除了模糊的腐败和不忠指控外，还有其他因素可能促成了**习近平**对其军事领导层的“**清洗**”，那就是**偏执**。他们说，近年来，美国情报分析人士评估认为，他有极度的偏执，因为他不仅解散了世界上最大军队的军事指挥官，还解散了共产党官员、安全主管等，同时收紧了他对权力的控制。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: Current and former US officials tell the Times that beyond the hazy allegations of corruption and disloyalty, something else could be contributing to President Xi's obliteration of his military leadership, paranoia. They said that in recent years, American intelligence analysts have assessed that she has extreme levels of paranoia as he's taken down not just military commanders of the world's largest army, but Communist Party officials, security chiefs, and others while he's tightened his own grip on power.

### 威斯敏斯特犬展

**>>**: 最后，在第 150 届**威斯敏斯特犬展**上获得“全场总冠军”的是一只杜宾犬。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: And finally, for best in show at the 150th Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show is the Doberman Pincher.

</details>

**>>**: 世界上最负盛名的犬展于昨晚落下帷幕，杜宾犬 **Penny** 获胜。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: The world's most prestigious dog show wrapped up last night with a victory for Penny the Doberman Pincher.

</details>

**>>**: 这里没有省吃俭用。这是一只必须超越一群令人印象深刻的竞争对手的狗。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: There was no pinching pennies here. This was a dog that had to outlast an impressive group of

</details>

**>>**: 它的毛皮光滑而雄伟。它的举止沉着，耳朵像百合花一样卷曲。教科书般的。它的牵犬师，如果我们谈论人类的话，他早在 1989 年就赢得了全场总冠军。也是用一只杜宾犬。该品种自那时以来就没有获胜过。昨晚的亚军是一只名叫 Kota 的切萨皮克湾寻回犬，它叼着绶带跑来跑去，然后把它扔掉了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: Her coat was sleek and majestic. Her demeanor calm, her ears curled like callillies. Textbook. Her handler, if we're going to talk about the humans, I guess, won best in show all the way back in 1989, too. Also with a Doberman pincher. The breed had not won since. The runner up last night went to a Chesapeake Bay Retriever named Kota, who grabbed his ribbon in his mouth and paraded around with it before dropping it.

</details>

**>>**: 我们不能错过这个。他为了最好的成绩努力了两年半。不，不，不。他不能错过杰瑞。在比赛进行到一半时，威斯敏斯特犬展为女演员 **Katherine O'Hara** 举办了一个小型致敬活动，她在她最标志性的角色之一中，在伪纪录片《**展会明星**》中扮演了一位充满活力的犬类牵犬师。O'Hara 上周去世了，一些粉丝来到威斯敏斯特犬展纪念她，周围是她非常非常喜欢的诺维奇梗犬。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: We can't miss this. He's worked for two and a half years for best. No, no, no. He can't miss Jerry. Partway through the show, Westminster put up a little tribute to the actress Katherine O'Hara, who in one of her most iconic roles played the spirited dog handler in the mockumentary Best in Show. O'Hara died last week, and some fans turned out to remember her at Westminster, surrounded by Norwich Terriers, who she really, really loves in the movie. God didn't miss a stitch.

</details>

**>>**: 无论是狗还是他让诺维奇梗犬带着它的小屁股。是的，上帝爱梗犬。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: Be it dog or be it when he made the Norwich Marrier with it little derrier. Yes, God loves a terrier.
