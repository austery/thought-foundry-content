### 问候与图尔卡纳的背景

在我成长的家乡，我们见面时会互相问候：“你好吗？孩子怎么样？牛怎么样？在下雨吗？”
所以，你好吗？孩子怎么样？牛怎么样？你有牛吗？你有驼鹿吗？（Meese? Mooses?）没有。
（笑声）
在下雨吗？
不过，我想在这里，你们应该问“阳光怎么样？”
是的。
2014年，我去了**图尔卡纳**（Turkana）地区拍摄一部电影。图尔卡纳位于肯尼亚最北端，那里的人们长期以来被边缘化，以至于他们不认同自己是肯尼亚人。独立后的政策将这个新国家的全部资源都集中在了农业发达的南部地区。但现在，随着石油的发现，肯尼亚开始对图尔卡纳提出主权要求。

Where I come from, we greet people:
How are you?
How are the children?
How are the cattle?
Is it raining?
So, how are you?
How are the children?
How the cattle? Do you have cattle?
Do you have moose? Meese?
Mooses? No.
OK.
(Laughter)
Is it raining?
Though here, I think
you should ask for sun.
So yeah.
So I went to Turkana
in 2014 to make a film.
Turkana is in the northernmost
part of Kenya,
and the people there
have been marginalized for so long
that they don't identify as Kenyans.
Post-independence policies had focused
all the resources of the new country
in the agriculturally rich south.
But now, with the discovery of oil,
Kenya was laying claim to Turkana.

### 家族历史与身份认同

就在我祖辈一代之前，我的家庭被迫在现代化的浪潮和殖民主义的双重力量下，从**游牧畜牧**（nomadic pastoralism）的生活方式转型。我的祖父还会讲述在**裂谷**（Rift Valley）地区带着他们的牲畜四处迁徙的故事，那样的生活与我们现在的生活似乎相去甚远。他会指着马赛人身着全套传统服饰的照片说：“这就是你们。”而我会说：“不，不，不，那些是生活在《**《国家地理》**》（National Geographic）杂志里的人。”
（笑声）

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
Just one generation before,
my family was compelled by the twin forces
of modernity and colonialism
to transition away
from a life of nomadic pastoralism.
My grandfather would still tell stories
of wandering up and down the Rift Valley
with their animals
that seemed so far removed
from the life we lived now.
And he would be like, "This is you,"
pointing to pictures of Maasai
people in full traditional regalia.
And I was like, "No, no, no,
those are the guys who live
in 'National Geographic.'"
(Laughter)

### 项目目标与深层需求

因此，我们带着人们想要公平分享石油收入的信念开始了这个项目，而他们确实也这么想。但他们想要的远不止这些。他们需要水和安全来继续他们的畜牧生活方式，因为那是他们文化和身份认同的一部分。这迫使我们思考，需要以我们之前未曾考虑过的新方式来存在于这个世界。我将要谈谈我们在图尔卡纳的工作如何教会我们进行**创造性协作**，以及这又如何教会我们如何团结起来，分享收益，并分享我们的人性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
So we went into the project
believing that people wanted
a fair share of the oil revenues,
which they did.
But they wanted so much more.
They wanted water and security
to continue with their
pastoralist way of life,
because it was part
of their culture and identity.
This forced us to think
of new ways of being in the world
that we hadn't previously considered.
I'm going to talk about how
our work in Turkana taught us
to creatively collaborate,
and then how that taught us
to come together, share revenues
and share our humanity.

### 图尔卡纳的组织模式

图尔卡纳地区以称为“**Ere**”的单位进行组织，这些单位拥有特定**牧场**（grazing points）和**水源地**（watering lands）的权利。这更像是一种**托管**（custodianship）而非所有权，它促使当地的组织思考新的**共享模式**（sharing models），这些模式基于当地文化，而不是照搬那些实践了更长时间的经济体。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
Turkana is organized
in units called “Ere,”
which have rights
to particular grazing points
and our watering lands.
And this is more like
a custodianship than an ownership,
and it has led organizations on the ground
to think of new sharing models
that were based on the culture,
rather than copy pasting from economies
that had been doing this for longer.

### 艺术合作与实地考察

因此，我们决定不把所有资源都投入到一部纪录片中（这部片子实际上只需要三个人就能完成），而是决定做一些更宏大的事情，吸引更多艺术家参与。于是，我们召集了十位艺术家，五位来自内罗毕，五位来自图尔卡纳，并开始了全县的巡演。我们去了南部的油田，在**纳库库拉斯**（Nakukulas）与一个**Edong’a**（一种舞蹈团体）共舞。我们去了**图尔卡纳盆地研究所**（Turkana Basin Institute），看到了数百万年前的化石。我们去了**中央岛**（Central Island），参观了盛产**罗非鱼**（tilapia）、鳄鱼和火烈鸟的湖泊。我们在**图尔卡纳湖**（Lake Turkana）上**满月**下游泳，湖水看起来像牛奶一样。有人向我们保证，鳄鱼会待在它们那边，人们待在他们这边。而且，还有“十人法则”：如果你们十个人一起游泳，被鳄鱼吃掉的几率只有10%。
（笑声）
我们去了图尔卡尔河（River Turkwel）附近的一个**牛圈**（cattle kraal），睡在地上的兽皮上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
So instead of putting all the resources
into our documentary,
which could be made
by literally three people,
we decided to make something bigger
that could bring in many more artists.
So we brought together ten artists,
five from Nairobi and five from Turkana,
and embarked on a tour of the county.
We went to the oil fields in the south
and danced with an Edong’a 
group in Nakukulas.
We went to Turkana Basin Institute
and saw fossils that were
millions of years old.
We went to Central Island
and visited tilapia,
crocodile and flamingo lakes.
We went swimming in Lake Turkana
under a full moon
that made the lake look like milk.
We were assured that the crocodiles
stayed on their side
and the people stayed on their side.
And anyway, there was the rule of ten.
If ten of you were swimming,
there was only a 10 percent chance
you'd be eaten by a crocodile.
(Laughter)
We went to a cattle kraal
near the River Turkwel
and slept on hides on the ground.

### 重拾祖先的智慧

那一刻，我突然明白了我们为什么会那样问候。你好吗？孩子怎么样？牛怎么样？在下雨吗？这些在几代人中一直是构成我们生活的要素。没有牛，我们就无法生存。没有雨水，牛就无法生存。没有后代，当我们离开人世后，谁来讲述我们的故事？我感受到了与祖父深刻的**连接**。事实上，这次旅程让我们所有人都深受触动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
It suddenly made so much sense
to me why we greet the way we do.
How are you, how are the children,
how are the cattle, is it raining?
Those had been the essential elements
of our lives for generations.
Without cattle, we would not survive.
Without the rain, the cattle
would not survive.
Without descendants,
who'd tell our stories when we were gone?
I felt a deep connection
with my grandfather.
In fact,
we all came out of that journey
profoundly moved.

### 人性与协作的力量

也许是躺在沙滩上，看着飞往欧洲和中东的航班从头顶掠过，想到这是我们人类祖先数万年前为了繁衍地球所走的同一条路。也许是敞开心扉，拥抱那个我们首次进化出**连接**（connection）、**协作**（cooperation）、**同情心**（compassion）的时刻。这些正是定义我们**人性**（humanity）的特质。因此，我们以此为基础开始创作。我们共同的经历加上新的发现，创造出了超越我们个体能力的作品。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
Perhaps it was lying down on the sand
and watching the flights to Europe
and the Middle East pass overhead
and thinking that this was the same path
our human ancestors took
tens of thousands of years ago
to populate the Earth.
Perhaps it was opening up
yourself to the moment
in the place where we first
