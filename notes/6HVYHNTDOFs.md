### 冰之王的垄断与早期制冷困境

1841年夏天，佛罗里达医生**约翰·戈里**（John Gorrie）面临一场严峻的公共卫生危机：黄热病肆虐，夺走了无数生命。面对高烧不退的病人，戈里医生迫切需要冰块来降温，但当时的制冷技术尚未发明。他采取了一种激进的治疗方案：在病房内悬挂冰盘，让冷空气下沉为病人提供缓解。然而，这种疗法难以持续，因为每天需要数百公斤的冰，而冰块的唯一来源是一个跨越数千公里的“冰帝国”，由被称为“冰之王”的**弗雷德里克·都铎**（Frederic Tudor）一手建立并掌控。都铎通过船只和冰库网络，在35年间建立了一个全球性的冰块垄断，使得冰成为一种稀缺且昂贵的“白色黄金”。戈里每年只能获得少量冰块，在夏季高峰期，几天冰块的成本甚至超过了普通人一年的工资。眼睁睁看着病人受苦离世，戈里下定决心要找到一种方法，将世界从“冰之王”的桎梏中解放出来。

- In the summer of 1841, Florida Doctor John Gorrie faced a dire situation. Yellow fever, also known as the black vomit, was sweeping through his town, wiping out entire families. Patients came to Gorrie's small infirmary, jaundiced and burning with fevers up to 40 degrees Celsius. To cool his patients down, Gorrie couldn't turn to refrigeration because that hadn't been invented yet. So, he came up with a radical treatment. He suspended pans of ice in his infirmary, allowing the cool, dense air to flow down over his patients, providing much-needed relief. But, this treatment was almost impossible to sustain because it required hundreds of kilograms of ice per day, and Gorrie had only one way to get it. He relied on ice blocks that were transported thousands of kilometers through a now-forgotten ice empire, a vast network of ships and ice houses all built and controlled by one man. Known to the world as the Ice King. Over the previous 35 years, he had forged a monopoly that spanned the globe, and anyone who wanted ice was at his mercy. Gorrie only got a few deliveries each year, and now, by the peak of summer, the cost of just a few days' ice for the infirmary would've been more expensive than the average yearly wage. So, locals began to refer to the ice as white gold. As Gorrie's supply ran out, he was forced to watch his patients suffer and die. It was in that moment that he decided he would find a way to free the world from the grip of the Ice King.

### 都铎的商业洞察与冰块保存古老智慧

在19世纪初，美国大部分的冰块来自北方各州冬季结冰的湖泊。然而，采集冰块的过程极其危险且耗时，使得冰块成为富裕阶层的专属奢侈品。22岁的波士顿商人**弗雷德里克·都铎**在1805年冬天，回忆起四年前在加勒比海旅行时，他与兄弟因高烧无法降温而被迫提前回国，最终兄弟不幸离世的悲剧。尽管后来得知冰块并不能挽救他兄弟的生命（他可能患有罕见的骨结核），但都铎当时坚信是岛上缺乏冰块导致了这一悲剧。这一痛苦的记忆激发了他一个大胆的想法：将冰块运往加勒比海，并在过程中赚取财富。他的计划最初被投资者嘲笑，因为长达三周的航程需穿越热带海域，冰块似乎注定会融化。然而，人类早在数千年前就掌握了冰块的保存方法。公元前500年，波斯帝国在酷热的夏季，国王**薛西斯**（Xerxes）就能享用冰镇甜点。波斯人利用冬季夜间结冰的浅水池获取冰块，并采用三项关键技术将其保存至夏季。

By the turn of the 19th century, most of America's ice came from the northern states, where thousands of square kilometers of lakes would freeze over for much of the year. The hard part was getting all that ice out. To get ice out of a lake or river, first of all, you had to trust that it was deep enough to support your weight, and there's no way to really tell. Then, you had to walk out several feet onto this plane of ice, take a saw, that's as long as I am tall, and then carve the very ice that you're standing on and just hope to heaven that it doesn't sink. Then, you had to kind of float it to shore, and a horse would help to kind of pull the ice into the back of a wagon. It was frequently common for the harvesters and their horses to fall through into the ice, sometimes to their death. This dangerous and painstaking process meant that ice remained a rare commodity, available mostly to wealthy landowners. One of the few who had access to it was 22-year-old Boston merchant Frederic Tudor. In the winter of 1805, Tudor was thinking back to a tragic incident that had happened four years earlier. He and his brother came down with a bad fever while visiting the Caribbean. Back home, they would've just asked their servants to get some ice. But on the islands, ice was unheard of. With no way to cool down, the brothers cut their trip short and returned to America. And while Frederic recovered, his brother did not. Today, we know that ice wouldn't have saved his brother's life because he likely suffered from a rare case of bone tuberculosis. But at the time, Tudor believed that it was the lack of ice on the islands that was responsible for his brother's death. It was this painful memory that gave him an idea. What if he could be the one to bring ice to the Caribbean? And, in the process, make his fortune. So, Tudor got to work. He hired dozens of men to gather ice and approached investors to help finance a ship. But to the investors, this plan seemed ridiculous. Tudor wrote, "People only laugh when I tell them I'm going to carry ice to the West Indies," which is understandable because the journey would take three weeks, sailing through warm seas under the blazing Caribbean sun. I mean, can you really transport ice in those conditions for that long? Wouldn't it all just melt? It turns, out people had figured out ways to make ice last a long time, even thousands of years ago. As far back as 500 BC, in the scorching summers of the Persian Empire, ancient kings, like Xerxes, enjoyed refreshing frozen desserts, even when the outside temperature climbed as high as 35 degrees Celsius. Now, ice in the desert might seem strange, but during the winter months, temperatures can drop dramatically. So, the Persians filled shallow pools with water, which would freeze overnight, and in the morning, they would break up the ice sheets and collect the pieces. To make that ice last until the summer, they used three key techniques.

### 冰块保存的科学原理与波斯智慧

波斯人保存冰块的关键技术基于物理学原理：首先是**紧密堆叠**（Tight Packing），通过减少冰块暴露的表面积来降低热传导。实验表明，相同体积的冰块，堆叠在一起比分散放置融化得慢得多，因为冰块主要通过表面热传导融化。其次是**平方立方定律**（Square-Cube Law），即冰块体积越大，其表面积与体积之比越小，融化速度越慢。例如，将雪人的半径加倍，其体积增加8倍（2的立方），而表面积只增加4倍（2的平方）。芬兰赫尔辛基市曾将清扫的积雪堆成30米高、100米宽的巨型雪堆，即使在炎热夏季也能保存近一年，正是这一原理的体现。最后是**隔绝气流**（Minimizing Airflow），通过将冰块置于深坑或密封结构中，使冷空气下沉并聚集在冰块周围，同时阻挡外界暖空气的对流。波斯人建造的**亚克查尔**（Yakhchal: 古代波斯冰屋），是一种巨大的圆顶结构，底部墙壁厚达两米，可储存多达220吨冰块。这种设计利用深坑紧密堆叠冰块，让冷空气聚集，同时将暖空气通过圆顶排出，并在冬季结束后密封整个结构，有效隔绝热量，确保冰块能保存到夏季。

Let's try simple a experiment. I have eight ice cubes spread evenly in one dish here and I have another eight ice cubes now stacked together in one mega cube in this dish over here. Now, if you leave these two plates to melt for a few hours, the stacked ice cubes fare a lot better, and that's because the main way ice melts is through heat conduction on its surface. So, even though the volume was the same, the surface area exposed here is double what we had here. The key idea here is that you wanna pack your ice as tightly as possible. In fact, the best shape to minimize the surface area is a sphere. So, if you think about it, a snowman is pretty much mathematically optimal to survive as long as possible. But, you don't need perfect geometry to make ice last a long time. In the winter of 2010, the city of Helsinki dumped all the snow plowed from their streets onto this huge pile, around 30 meters high and 100 meters wide. Almost a year later, that very same pile was still around, despite being exposed to one of the country's hottest summers in decades. The main reason it lasted so long is because the ratio of surface area to volume actually decreases for larger and larger amounts of ice. For example, if you double the radius of this snowman, then the volume of ice increases by a factor of two cubed or eight, but the surface area only increases by a factor of two squared or four. This is known as the square cube law, which was the second technique used by the Persians. And finally, they needed a way to shield the ice from the harsh desert. Okay, I have another example. Two ice cubes, two dishes. The only difference, really, is gonna be that I have this fan, which is gonna be blowing air onto this ice cube. Now, it's not heating any of the air, it's just blowing away any air the ice would've chilled for itself. And it's introducing more warmer, ambient-temperature air, which heats the ice cube better. After about an hour of the fan blowing, this ice cube is completely gone, whereas this one is only about 40% melted. So, obviously, you wanna minimize the amount of airflow that you're getting around your ice. One way you can do that is by putting the ice in a deeper dish, like a pit, because colder air sinks to the bottom, so it collects around the ice and lets it stay there for longer. And a way you can one-up that is to seal the ice, which is exactly what the Persians did. This is a yakhchal, an ancient Persian ice house. It's a massive dome structure with walls up to two meters thick at the base. Here, the Persians collected up to 220 tonnes of ice and packed it tightly together in a pit. This allowed the cold, dense air to collect while warm air was funneled up and out of the dome. After the winter, the entire structure was sealed up, insulating the ice until summer.

### 都铎的商业策略与全球冰帝国

都铎决定将自己的财富押注在这些古老的冰块保存原则上。他抵押家族地产购买船只，并将其改装成类似冰屋的货舱，将冰块抬高以避免融水加速融化，并紧密堆叠。1806年，都铎首次将80多吨冰块运往马提尼克岛，尽管他的兄弟和表兄未能按时建造冰库，导致冰块在炎热的阳光下直接出售，损失惨重，但都铎并未气馁。他意识到，加勒比海的居民不了解冰块的用途，因此他需要**创造需求**。他免费向酒吧提供冰块，教他们制作冰镇鸡尾酒，并展示如何制作冰淇淋，这些产品迅速受到欢迎，尤其是在古巴。通过这种市场教育和需求创造，都铎的生意开始好转。他进一步优化了方法，例如使用廉价的**锯末**（Sawdust）作为船上冰块的绝缘材料，并用马拉犁取代人工锯来提高冰块开采效率，将每吨冰的成本从30美分降至10美分。

For the next 2,300 years, these techniques barely changed. And now, Tudor was ready to bet his fortune on these ancient principles. So, he mortgaged land on his family estate to buy a ship, and he began modifying it for the long journey to the West Indies. He did that by building out a cargo hole in a ship that was built similarly to the ice houses. The ice was elevated off the ground, so it wasn't sitting in melt water because melt water speeds up the melting of ice. And the blocks of ice were also packed really tightly. Tudor went all in, sinking a full $10,000 of mostly borrowed money into the venture, which is the equivalent of over a quarter million dollars today. He sent his youngest brother and his cousin ahead to the island of Martinique to build an ice house ready to receive the cargo. On the morning of February 13th, 1806, Tudor departed Boston Harbor, carrying with him over 80 metric tonnes of ice, the first shipment of its kind. The Boston Gazette ran an article that read, "No joke. A vessel has cleared at the Custom House with a cargo of ice. We hope this will not prove a slippery speculation." After nearly three weeks at sea, Tudor's ship arrived, and to his relief, around half of the ice had survived the trip. But there was a problem. His brother and cousin had failed to build an ice house. So, with no place to store the ice, Tudor had to sell it straight off the dock, under the hot sun. He sold as quickly as possible, but after two days, he had only made about $50. The locals were confused by the strange frozen water, and many were shocked when their new product disappeared before their eyes. One customer tried to save his precious ice by submerging it in a bath of water, only to find it vanishing even faster. In the end, all Tudor could do was watch his remaining ice melt away. Yet somehow, he was undeterred, and over the next four years, he continued to borrow money, using every cent to ship ice to new markets, like Cuba, Jamaica, Barbados, and Antigua. But, business remained difficult. Tudor wrote, "I found myself without money and without friends, and with only a cargo of ice in a torrid zone to depend on for the supply of both." By 1809, Tudor owed $40,000 to investors, which is over 1 million bucks today. He was hounded by creditors, he was forced to hide from sheriffs on his own ships, and he was even sent to debtor's prison twice. He later described it as, "The winter of my discontent," but during that time, he had a revelation. The reason demand wasn't picking up was because the people of the West Indies didn't know what to do with ice. So, all he had to do, he reasoned, was make them understand by offering them some refreshing drinks. He convinces the bartenders there to let him show them how to make icy cocktails, and he gives the ice initially to the bartenders for free. So, the bartenders can sell both the icy drink and the room temperature drink at the same price, just to see what their customers prefer. And lo and behold, they prefer the icy drink. In Tudor's own words, "A man who has drank his drinks cold at the same expense for one week can never be presented with them warm again." Tudor even showed them how to make ice cream, which became an instant hit, especially in Cuba. 150 years later, during the Cuban Revolution, its leader, Fidel Castro, was obsessed with ice cream. He was actually known to eat up to 18 scoops after lunchtime, which is a bit crazy. His sweet tooth was so famous that the CIA actually tried to assassinate him with a poisoned milkshake. Now, back in Tudor's day, his work was finally paying off. The cafe owners in the West Indies started asking him for more and more ice, and he realized that he could increase his profits, just by refining his methods. So, he started using sawdust to insulate his ice on the ships because sawdust was a phenomenal insulator that you could basically get for free from all the sawmills around Boston. They were just trying to get rid of it. And he also replaced the manual saws at the lakes with horse-drawn plows, which made it all the easier to get the ice out. Because of that, the price of extracting a tonne of ice dropped from around 30 cents all the way down to 10 cents.

### 冰贸易的社会影响与冷链诞生

到19世纪20年代，都铎终于开始盈利，冰贸易也蓬勃发展。为了维护自己的垄断地位，他经常通过削价竞争来挤垮对手。1833年，他完成了最宏大的挑战——将冰块运往远在印度加尔各答，尽管航程是加勒比海的五倍，仍有一半以上的冰块幸存。在印度，冰块大受欢迎，都铎在20年间仅在加尔各答就赚取了约22万美元。他的冰帝国迅速扩张到巴西、新加坡、香港乃至澳大利亚，年销售量从19世纪30年代的不足1万吨飙升至1856年的13.2万吨，世界因此称他为“冰之王”。在不到50年的时间里，冰贸易成为美国最大的产业之一，也是按重量计算的第二大出口商品。曾经的奢侈品变成了日用品。到了19世纪60年代，**冰盒**（Ice Box: 一种带冰块隔层的绝缘木柜，用于冷藏食物）开始进入普通家庭，纽约人平均每年购买超过600公斤冰块。这催生了一个独特的职业——**送冰人**（Iceman），他们挨家挨户送冰，甚至需要进入顾客家中，由此产生了许多关于送冰人的文化段子和歌曲。

By the 1820s, Tudor was finally turning a profit, and the ice trade began to pick up. So much so that copycat businesses began to crop up. But Tudor wasn't about to let anyone else have a share of the market he created. So, to maintain his monopoly, he often undercut his competition until they either gave up or went out of business. Tudor's ambition didn't end there, and he wrote that, There was "an experiment I have been desirous of making for 20 years." In 1833, he took on his biggest challenge yet, a four-month journey to ship ice halfway across the world to Calcutta, India. And despite the trip being five times longer than his first one to the Caribbean, more than half of the ice survived. In India, the ice was a big hit. Over the next 20 years, Tudor made around $220,000 in Calcutta alone, making it one of his most profitable ventures. Over that same period, he rapidly expanded his empire, opening roots to Brazil, Singapore, Hong Kong, and even Australia. His yearly sales went from less than 10,000 tonnes in the 1830s to a record high of 132,000 tonnes in 1856. Seeing the wealth and power of his monopoly, the world gave Tudor a new name: the Ice King. In under 50 years, the ice trade had become one of the largest industries in the US, and it's second largest export by weight. What was once a luxury product became a commodity. By the 1860s, devices known as ice boxes started popping up in ordinary kitchens. Essentially, they were insulated wooden cabinets with a compartment for ice at the top, which would then cool down the food underneath, keeping it fresh. Families across the country soon bought ice daily or weekly, with the average New Yorker buying over 600 kilograms a year. This surge in demand resulted in a curious new profession. The iceman. The iceman would go door to door, delivering huge blocks of ice up to 45 kilograms. And while home delivery was nothing new in the 19th century, the iceman was unique, in that he needed to go inside your house to make his delivery. All kinds of rumors and jokes and cultural thoughts started to to crop up. And if you look at some of the most popular songs at the time, "She Fell In Love with the Iceman," or "The Iceman Took My Wife." If you look at old Valentine's Day cards that were circulating at this time, they all had puns about the iceman. The iceman made my wife too hot; he was supposed to deliver ice. Like, it was so silly.

### 冷链系统的诞生与现代城市重塑

19世纪末，冰的消费量在纽约等大城市飙升，成为一项价值数十亿美元的产业。除了家用冰盒，主要驱动力来自新兴产业，如渔业、肉类加工业和酿酒业。随着铁路的发展，**冷藏车厢**（Refrigeration Car: 内部绝缘并装有冰块的铁路货车，用于运输易腐货物）应运而生，这标志着**冷链**（Cold Chain: 保持产品在特定温度范围内运输和储存的供应链系统）系统的开端。此前，新鲜肉类只能通过活牛运输，导致城市中心充斥着脏乱的牲畜，且由于近一半的动物不可食用，运输效率极低。冷藏车厢改变了这一切，供应链重组为三个部分：大平原的牧场将牛集中到中西部城市，这些城市成为工业化食品加工和分销中心，建立了庞大的牲畜围栏、屠宰场和铁路枢纽，将肉类运往全国。芝加哥崛起为全国肉类加工中心，人口从1850年的3万人激增到1900年的170万人。冷链系统使每节车厢可运输的食用肉量增加近一倍，城市地区的成本降低了39%，需求随之飙升。更重要的是，城市不再需要本地屠宰和加工肉类，从而清除了市中心的牲畜基础设施，将土地用于住房、办公室和工厂，从根本上改变了城市结构，催生了现代城市形态。

Consumption of ice in big cities like New York skyrocketed. And by the end of the 19th century, ice had grown into a billion-dollar business. And while part of the demand was due to home ice boxes, the real driving force was several new industries. The ice industry also launched the fish industry, the meat packing industry, the brewery industry. It became like this multi-level industry. When we get to the point where there are railroads, then comes the invention of the refrigeration car, railroad cars that were insulated with ice blocks to carry things that are perishable. So, if you think about it, fresh fruits and vegetables that have been region-locked now can become national staples. So, you have apricots and cherries from California, you have strawberries from Florida, they can all go inland. Actually, you want to guess the name of a vegetable that was really popularized with these chilled cars? Chilled vegetable. I'm gonna guess lettuce? Which one? Iceberg. It's gotta be iceberg, right? Exactly. It's like crunchy water. It's like ice, iceberg lettuce. It is crunchy water, but it was actually called iceberg because of the ice that kept it fresh. This change marked the beginning of a new system called the cold chain. And for the meat packing industry, it was a huge upgrade. Previously, the only way to transport fresh meat was by sending rail cars filled with live cattle straight from farms to cities. Then, the animals had to be brought into the city and held in local stockyards before they were prepared by local slaughterhouses and butchers. The result was that city centers were filled with dirty, noisy cows. And on top of that, since almost half of the animal was inedible, shipping was extremely inefficient, pushing up the cost. But, with chilled rail cars, all this changed, and the country's supply chain reorganized into three parts. First, ranches across the Great Plains funneled their cattle to cities in the Midwest. Taking on the role of industrial food preparation and distribution, these cities built up vast stockyards, slaughterhouses, and rail hubs to send the meat onward. Chicago emerged as the nation's meat packing capital, ballooning in size from just 30,000 people in 1850 to 1.7 million in 1900. And at the end of the chain were the large, insatiable cities. With the new system in place, almost twice as much edible meat could be transported in each rail car, eventually dropping the cost in urban areas by 39%. As a result, demand soared. In New York City alone, beef shipments rose from just 2,400 tonnes in 1882 to around 63,000 tons in 1886. That's a 25-fold increase in just four years. But more importantly, with a national distribution network to rely on, these cities no longer needed to prepare meat locally. They could finally get rid of all the infrastructure and herds of cows in the city center, freeing up the land for things like housing, offices, and factories. This fundamentally changed their structure and gave rise to the modern city of today.

### 戈里医生的制冷突破与热力学原理

正当冷链系统重塑美国之时，一项新发明即将颠覆天然冰产业，这又回到了19世纪40年代的**约翰·戈里**医生。他曾花费三年时间尝试制造人造冰但未成功。直到一个夜晚，在用气泵抽水时，他偶然发现如果空气迅速膨胀，水面会形成一层薄冰。这一发现成为了他突破的关键。戈里基于此原理设计了一个原型机：在一个充满空气的密封气缸内，活塞下压时，空气被压缩，压力和温度升高。这是因为活塞向下移动时，会撞击空气分子，使其获得速度，从而升高温度。反之，当活塞释放时，高压空气推动活塞回弹，分子撞击活塞时失去速度，温度下降。戈里意识到，如果先冷却压缩后的热高压空气，然后再让其膨胀，温度将远低于环境温度。他通过手摇曲柄驱动活塞压缩空气并将其泵入一个大型气罐，使压力达到约10个大气压。关键在于，他在活塞和气罐之间放置了一个水桶，强制空气通过浸没在水中的管道，将空气冷却到与水相同的温度。这样，气罐中充满了凉爽的高压空气。当这些凉爽的空气被释放到另一个活塞气缸中并迅速膨胀时，其温度骤降至冰点以下。戈里将这个气缸放入一个装满盐水（冰点低于0摄氏度）的大水箱中，再将装有淡水的金属模具浸入盐水中，最终制成了冰块。这实际上是世界上第一个**制冰盒**（Ice Cube Tray: 用于制作冰块的模具）。自此，冰块可以在任何地方被制造出来，即使在佛罗里达炎热的夏季也不例外。

But, while the cold chain was redefining America, a new invention was about to overthrow the natural ice industry, which brings us back to Dr. John Gorrie in the 1840s. A few scientists had devised and even built prototype cooling machines, but they weren't commercially viable. And Gorrie wasn't faring any better. He had spent three years struggling to make artificial ice with no success. But one night, while experimenting with an air pump to drain a bucket, he noticed that if you let the air expand quickly, it formed a thin layer of ice on the surface of the water. He had just stumbled upon the breakthrough he needed, and he set about creating a prototype based on this idea. Take a sealed cylinder filled with air and a piston that can move inside it. We'll assume there's no friction or heat lost to the environment. When the piston pushes down, the air is compressed, increasing its pressure and temperature. The reason the temperature increases is because as the piston pushes down, it moves toward the air molecules. So, when a molecule bounces off this moving surface, it gains a little bit of speed. And since the temperature is proportional to the molecules speed squared, well, the air must heat up. But, notice that this process is completely reversible. If the piston is released, the high pressure air pushes the piston back until the pressure equalizes. So now, when one of the molecules bounces off the piston, it loses a little bit of speed. Gorrie knew that if he simply let all of this hot, high-pressure air expand, it would return back to roughly its original temperature, which wouldn't be very helpful. But what if he first cooled the air and then let it expand? Well, then, its temperature would drop far lower than the ambient air. He started with a similar setup, a cylinder and a piston that were powered by a hand crank, which he then attached to a large air tank. As Gorrie turned the crank, the piston moved down, compressing the air and raising its temperature. To prevent the air from being sucked out of the large tank, Gorrie added a one-way valve at the bottom of the cylinder. He also added a similar valve at the top of the piston, so that the cylinder could refill with fresh air. So, now, with each turn of the crank, more and more air was added to the tank, which allowed to increase the pressure to around 10 atmospheres. But then, he added one extra step. In between the piston and the tank, he placed a big bucket of water and he forced the air through a submerged pipe. This cooled the air down to around the same temperature as the water. The result was that his tank was still filled with high-pressure air, but instead of being hot, it was cool. So, now, when Gorrie released some of his cool air into another cylinder with a piston, the air rapidly expanded. This cooled the air down below its starting point and dropped it to freezing temperatures. Gorrie then placed this entire cylinder inside a large tank of water, finally making ice. But to avoid the entire tank freezing solid and clogging up his machine, he used one final trick. Instead of fresh water, he filled the final tank with salt water, which freezes below zero degrees Celsius. Since the salt water remained liquid, he then submerged metal molds of fresh water until they froze into solid blocks, essentially creating the world's first ice cube tray. For the first time ever, ice could be created anywhere, even in the heat of the Florida summer.

### 人工制冰的阻力与哈里森的相变制冷

当**约翰·戈里**宣布他发明了制冰机时，社会反应是震惊和抵制，认为“只有上帝才能造冰”。“冰之王”**弗雷德里克·都铎**更是将此视为对其帝国最大的威胁。都铎通过收买报社编辑，在全国范围内散布关于戈里的负面新闻，称他为“妄想制造出与上帝一样好冰块的怪人”。尽管戈里获得了专利，但他一生中从未因此赚到一分钱，最终在贫困和疾病中去世。然而，戈里的发明并未被完全忽视。苏格兰裔工程师**詹姆斯·哈里森**（James Harrison）在澳大利亚工作时，改进了戈里机器的不足。戈里的机器仅依靠压缩机和膨胀机来传递热量，而哈里森则利用物质**相变**（Phase Change: 物质从一种物理状态（如液体）转变为另一种物理状态（如气体）的过程）时吸收大量能量的原理。他通过迫使流体在一个循环中不断蒸发和冷凝，实现高效制冷。现代制冷机的工作原理是：高压液体通过膨胀阀后，压力和温度迅速下降，部分液体汽化。混合物进入蒸发器盘管，剩余液体继续沸腾，吸收环境中的热量，从而产生冷却效果。随后，冷气体通过压缩机升温，再进入冷凝器盘管冷却并液化，释放热量，完成循环。哈里森的机器每天可制造3000公斤冰，取得了巨大的商业成功。

And when he says to the world like, "I've invented ice," the reaction was, "The hell you have. No man should be creating ice. Only God can create ice." And what John Gorrie also didn't realize is that in the first public venues in which he announces his ice machine, Frederic Tudor has his associates in the audience. And Frederic Tudor is a man who does not take lightly to threats to his empire. And what bigger threat to the naturalized harvesting empire is there than human-made ice? There was no way the Ice King was giving up his empire without a fight. What he ends up doing is he ends up paying editors up and down the eastern seaboard at newspapers to publish scandalous news articles about John Gorrie. So, everywhere from Tallahassee up to New York, you see newspapers publishing headlines, like, "There's this crank that thinks he can make ice as good as God Almighty." And ultimately, John Gorrie, he does patent his machine, but he never makes a dime on it. Gorrie spent the next few years in financial ruin. A decade later, he died alone and penniless, most likely succumbing to malaria. There are reports he suffered an extremely high fever in his final days, the very symptom he had tried to alleviate for so many years. But, Gorrie's invention hadn't been completely ignored. Soon, others began work on artificial cooling machines, including James Harrison, a Scottish-born engineer Working in Australia. Harrison noticed that Gorrie's machine had one big drawback. It relied on just two components to move heat: a compressor and an expansion engine. So, instead of using air to cool his machine, he tried a different approach. I have a can of freeze spray here, which is a liquid that when I press down on this button, comes out and immediately evaporates into a very, very low-temperature gas. So, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna blast it at this cup of water. And the process is actually so effective that in essentially under a minute, I'm able to get some ice to form in there. Okay. So, after a layer of water, what you get is... A bunch of ice. Now, the reason this works is because something special happens when a substance changes phase. So, in order to go from a liquid to a gas, it needs to absorb a lot of energy. And pretty much all this energy goes into overcoming the force of attraction between molecules, so that they can disperse and go into the gas phase. Harrison realized he could take advantage of this effect by forcing a fluid to continuously evaporate and condense as it's going through a loop. A modern version looks something like this. Start by adding a liquid under high pressure to a loop. Passing this liquid through an expansion valve quickly drops the pressure and temperature, causing some of the liquid to immediately turn into a gas. The mixture then passes into an evaporator coil, where the remaining liquid continues to boil. But, this phase change requires a lot of energy. So, the liquid absorbs heat from the environment, and this is what creates the cooling effect. The cold gas is then cycled through a compressor, raising its temperature, and then it's pushed through a condenser coil. Here, the hot gas cools and turns back into a liquid, releasing the absorbed heat back into the environment before returning to the expansion valve. By repeating this cycle over and over again, Harrison was reportedly able to manufacture as much as 3,000 kilograms of ice per day. And his machine was a huge commercial success.

### 人工制冰的胜利与现代世界的基石

随着人工制冷技术的成熟，公众对“非神造之冰”的抵触情绪逐渐消退，取而代之的是对天然冰块日益增长的健康担忧。19世纪中叶，工业革命达到顶峰，工厂和农场将化学品和废弃物排入湖泊河流，导致天然冰块受到污染。使用天然冰块可能导致霍乱、食物中毒等疾病，甚至医院用冰治疗伤口反而会引发感染。人工制冰则因其可控性和卫生性而显示出巨大优势，最终取代了天然冰。1927年，第一台经济实惠的家用冰箱进入大众市场，成为20世纪普及最快的技术之一，从1920年代不到1%的家庭拥有率迅速增长到1944年的85%，甚至超过了汽车的普及速度。制冷技术及其催生的**冷链**系统，不仅改变了食品供应（如草莓、生菜等新鲜果蔬得以全国流通），更对现代医学和科学研究产生了深远影响。疫苗、血液制品、胰岛素等关键医疗用品的运输和储存都依赖冷链。此外，哈里森和戈里所用的制冷原理，也使人类能够将温度降至接近绝对零度，从而推动了核磁共振成像（MRI）、欧洲核子研究组织（CERN）的**大型强子对撞机**（Large Hadron Collider: 世界上最大的粒子加速器，用于探索宇宙基本粒子和力）、**詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜**（James Webb Space Telescope: 世界上最强大的太空望远镜，用于观测早期宇宙）以及**聚合酶链式反应**（PCR: 一种分子生物学技术，用于扩增DNA片段）等众多科学发现和技术进步。

Meanwhile, public resistance to Godless ice and artificial cooling began to fade, overshadowed by a growing health crisis linked to natural ice. One of the reasons artificial ice was so much better is because we make it on our own terms. With natural ice, we had to wait until the right season, in the right place, and then whatever happened in the water that froze, like something died or was rotting in there, you had to work with it. By the time we get to the mid-19th century, the peak of the Industrial Revolution, factories and farms just letting loose their chemicals and detritus into the nearby lakes and rivers. You put an ice block into your cocktail, you could get cholera. There are, like, stories of hospitals treating wounds with ice, and then the ice makes you get a disease, and your wound isn't even the problem. They're getting cholera, they're getting food poisoning or ice poisoning. I mean, they're getting very, very sick. It's so funny, when we were first talking about this story, I was thinking about this frozen New England ice, and I was just imagining like the purest lake water, this crystal-clear ice, and, like, just this incredible product, right? But now that you mentioned it, like, yeah, it probably is a lot less hygienic. And yeah, there's probably germs in there. And so the human-made ice companies were like, "Sure, our ice isn't made by God. But, natural ice will kill you. So, which one do you want?" After the first affordable home refrigerator landed in the mass market in 1927, it became one of the fastest adopted new technologies of the entire 20th century, going from less than 1% of homes having one in the 1920s to 85% by 1944. This made its take off even faster than the motorcar replacing the horse-drawn cart. There's this argument of, "Would the world really be so different without refrigeration?" Like, sure, food, strawberries, iceberg lettuce, but then you think about vaccines, blood donations, insulin, that the same cold chain transports those things. And then, beyond medicine, the same principles that Harrison and Gorrie used for their fridges are what allow us to cool things down to almost absolute zero. Over the past century, so many of the discoveries that we made rely on this principle of refrigeration: MRIs, the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, the James Webb Telescope. All of that is also refrigeration. And my favorite is the PCR story, where Thermus aquaticus was in a fridge for 16 years before Kary Mullis discovered it. There wouldn't have been that connection to make PCR viable in that way without a fridge.

I think it's easier to focus on the movement of macroscopic objects and macroscopic things happening, but this is really about controlling motion on the smallest scale, controlling thermal motion, which is a pretty remarkable breakthrough. I mean, we could heat things up for a long time, so you wanna increase the thermal energy of molecules. You could do that from the time we had fire. But actually, taking those molecules and figuring out how to remove their thermal energy and really slow them down, that's the refrigeration story. And that's really recent. But as you point out, like, it has profound effects. Gorrie was able to make ice because he wasn't afraid to step outside his own profession, medicine, and venture into a new field, thermodynamics. And while you probably don't need to reinvent the fridge, learning a new skill is always handy. Here at Veritasium, we create simulations and models to test our ideas and illustrate them.
