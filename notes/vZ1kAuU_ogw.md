### 引言：AI与教育的未来展望

各位下午好，非常感谢大家今天能和我们在一起。我是Joy Joy Chen，非常荣幸能担任今天关于AI与教育的小组讨论主持人。我也非常高兴能与我的三位好友——Ben、Isabelle和Esther——同台。那么，让我们直接进入对话。在过去的几年里，我们见证了AI如何改变我们的生活、工作，当然也包括学习方式。我想问三位小组成员，当你们思考AI与教育，特别是展望2030年及以后时，最让你们兴奋的是什么？最让你们担忧的又是什么？或许我们可以从Esther开始。

<p class="english-text">All right, good afternoon. Thank you so much for being here with us. My name is Joy Joy Chen. I am very honored to be the moderator for today's panel about AI and education. And also I'm very delighted to share the stage with three of my dear friends, Ben, Isabelle, and Esther. Um so let's just dive into the conversation. Uh over the past several years uh we have witnessed how AI has transformed how we live, how we work and of course how we learn and um I'd like to ask uh three uh panelists when you think about AI and education especially when we look forward uh look towards uh 2030 and beyond what excites you the most and what concerns you the most? Maybe I can start with uh Esther.</p>
</details>

Esther: 最让我兴奋的是，AI可以成为每个学生的导师。他们可以反复提问，不必担心自己显得愚蠢或任何问题，并且能立即得到答案。这在以前是不可能实现的。我认为所有老师都应该在课堂上使用AI作为导师。不幸的是，尽管我们这里都有很多令人兴奋的想法，但我们需要努力将这些想法传达给老师们。因为，我不知道你们中有多少人有孩子在学校系统里，但他们仍然在做着同样的老一套，记忆着上个世纪问题的答案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Esther: So, what excites me the most is that AI can be a tutor for every single student. They can ask questions. They can ask it over and over again. They don't have to worry about being stupid or anything. And they can get answers right away. And that was not the case before. And I think all teachers should use AI as tutors in the classroom. Um, unfortunately, I think, you know, we all have exciting ideas over here. I think that what we need to do is try to get those ideas across to the teachers because, um, right now, I don't know how many of you have kids in the school system, but they're still doing the same old thing, memorizing answers to last centuries problems.</p>
</details>

主持人: 那么，AI最让你担忧的是什么呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moderator: And what concerns you the most with AI?</p>
</details>

Esther: 关于AI，我最担忧的是它发展得非常非常快，希望是在道德伦理的框架下。我认为伦理问题、**深度伪造**（Deepfakes: 利用人工智能技术生成虚假图像、音频或视频）以及所有虚假新闻和信息，最让我担忧。所以，我认为教孩子们如何批判性思考非常重要。他们通过实际犯错并重新尝试来学习批判性思考，而不是你告诉他们该怎么做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Esther: Well, with AI, what concerns me, it's growing really, really quickly and um hopefully ethically. I think the ethics and the deep fakes and all the fake news and fake information out there, that concerns me the most. So, I think it's important to teach kids how to think critically. And um they learn to do that by actually making mistakes and doing it again, not by you telling them what to do.</p>
</details>

主持人: 完全同意。Isabelle，你有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moderator: Totally agree. And what about you, Isabelle?</p>
</details>

Isabelle: 是的，最让我兴奋的是，教育对许多儿童和成年学习者来说一直未能奏效。而现在，我们拥有一项技术，它真正开启了深刻的问题和可能性。我们称AI为教育的**WD40**（一种多功能润滑剂品牌，此处比喻为解决教育困境的万能工具）。它正在开启新的问题，比如在这个AI时代，**面向未来就绪**（Future Ready: 具备适应未来社会和工作变化所需技能和知识）意味着什么？教育的目的是什么？这些都是我们长期以来一直想问的问题。所以我对所有这些新的可能性感到非常非常兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Isabelle: Yeah, what excites me the most is um um education has not worked for many many children uh and adult learners. Um and so here we have a technology that sally unlocks profound questions, profound possibilities. Um we call AI um the WD40 for education. It's unlocking new questions uh such as you know what does it mean to be future ready uh in this age of AI? What is the purpose of education? Things that we have been wanting to ask for a long time. So I'm very very excited about all those new possibilities.</p>
</details>

那么，最让我担忧的是，目前AI在教育中主要用于提高效率。这很好。但如果我们止步于此，我们就有可能复制过去，而不是重新构想未来，而后者才是我对这项技术最兴奋的地方——它带来的新可能性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Isabelle: And then what concerns me the most is um right now AI is used for a lot of efficiency applications in education. Uh which is good. Um but if we stop if we stop there, we risk replicating the past as opposed to rem reimagining the future, which I think is uh what I'm most excited about with this technology is new possibilities.</p>
</details>

Ben: 我先说说我的担忧，然后再谈谈让我兴奋的地方。我的担忧是基于我们教育系统的现状。大约12年前，当我为我大女儿找学校时，我尝试了一所针对学术天赋儿童的表演艺术学校。这是一种有趣的组合。我问了创始人正在带我们参观的儿子，他当时是校长，我说：“你母亲是怎么想到为学术天赋儿童创办艺术学校这个主意的？”他说她没有。她只想创办一所艺术学校。她根本不关心学术。所以在1981年，她使用了加州所有学校都在用的州标准课程，我们从未改变过。而现在，也就是12年前，我们比州内其他学校领先了一年半。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ben: I'll give you a um my concern first and then maybe what I'm excited about. The concern is based on the state of our education system. When when I was looking for a school for my uh eldest daughter about 12 years ago, I tried a school that was an arts a performing arts school for academically gifted children. And it was that's kind of an interesting combination. And I asked the the son of the founder who was giving the tour as a principal. I said, "How did your mother come up with this idea of of a art school for academically gifted children?" He says she didn't. She wanted to start an art school. She had no care in the world about the academics whatsoever. So in 1981, she used the California state standard curriculum that everybody was using and we never changed it. And now, which was 12 years ago, we're a year and a half ahead of the rest of the state.</p>
</details>

我为什么要提起这个？我提起它是因为师生之间存在一种**魔鬼的交易**（Devil's Bargain: 指为了获得短期利益而做出长期有害的妥协），即双方工作越少，他们就越高兴。而AI可以像其他任何事物一样加速这种趋势。AI可以使老师的工作变得非常非常容易，也可以使学生的工作变得非常非常容易，但双方都没有学习发生。这是最大的风险，因为所有参与认证或被称为教育部门的人的激励系统，都是尽可能少地工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ben: And why do I bring this up? I bring it up because there is a devil's bargain between teacher or professor and student, which is the less work they both do, the happier they both are. And AI can turbocharge that like nothing else. AI can make the teacher's job much, much easier. It can make the students job much much easier and there's no learning that happens on either side and that's the biggest risk because the incentive system of everyone involved in the certification or otherwise what's known as the education sector is to do as little work as humanly possible.</p>
</details>

机会，以及每项新技术带来的机会，正如Isabelle所说，不是如何将旧技术硬塞进现有系统。而是要问：“哇，这个旧系统根本不起作用。现在有什么样的系统，什么样的教育路径是以前无法实现的？”这正是AI为那些足够大胆、敢于这样思考的人所开启的巨大机遇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ben: The opportunity and the opportunity with every new technology to Isabelle's point is not how to take that old technology and jam it into the current system. It is to say, "Wow, this old system doesn't work whatsoever. What kind of system, what kind of educational path is now enabled that couldn't be done before?" And and that is the big opportunity that AI unlocks for those bold enough to think in that way.</p>
</details>

### 重新设计大学：适应新时代的需求

主持人: 非常感谢你们分享的兴奋点和担忧。鉴于AI已经并将继续为我们的生活带来的一切，我确实认为我们的教育系统将不得不经历大量的变革和转型，以满足新的学习需求和不断变化的工作力期望。特别是大学，因为它们正在为学生的未来职业做准备。所以，如果今天给你们一个重新设计大学的机会，你们的大学会是什么样子？也许我想从Ben开始，因为你自从创立**Minerva大学**（Minerva University: 一所创新型大学，以其全球沉浸式教育模式和强调批判性思维的课程而闻名）以来，就已经开始了这一愿景和使命，顺便说一句，它取得了巨大的成功。恭喜你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moderator: Well, thank you so much for sharing your excitements and concerns. Um, with all the things AI has brought to our life and will continue to bring to our life, I do think our education education system will have to go through lots of change, lots of transformations to meet the new learning uh uh needs and also the shifting workforce expectations. Um so if especially universities actually because they are preparing our uh students for their future career. Um so if today you guys were given an opportunity to redesign universities um what would your university uh be like uh maybe I I'd like to start from Ben because you have already start this vision and mission ever since you founded uh Minurva University which by the way is a huge success. Uh congratulations.</p>
</details>

Ben: 谢谢。Minerva大学的建立，部分原因是我错误地认为AI将在2012年左右广泛可用。所以我在这方面预测错了几年。但我建立了一所大学，它提出的问题是：当知识和解决方案都唾手可得时，作为人类意味着什么？当你思考这个范式时，人类剩下要做的是判断、辨别和决策。因为我们可能会把很多工作外包给机器，但我想这里没有人会因为机器决定你的税率而感到兴奋，对吧？你希望能够自己决定。你希望能够参与、治理、投票。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ben: Thank you. Um well, Manuva was certainly built uh because of my mistaken assumption or one of the reasons it was built my mistaken assumption that basically AI would be widely available circa 2012. So I I I was off by a few years in that. But I built a university that asked the question of what does it mean to be human when access to knowledge and not just knowledge but to solutions is readily available. And when you think about that paradigm, what's left for human beings is to judge, is to discern, to make decisions. Because we may outsource a lot of work to the machine, but I don't think anybody here would be excited if a machine determined your tax rate,</p>
</details>

这种辨别能力不是黑白分明的，因为当事情是真或假时，它是显而易见的，或者至少以前是这样。而是在黑与灰之间，当存在明确的错误答案时——尽管我们识别错误答案的能力越来越差——以及存在许多潜在的正确答案时。AI会在一眨眼间生成大量完全合理的情景。所以，就像视频里说的，我不同意，这不关乎如何提问。而是关乎如何评估从提问中得出的答案。这种辨别能力实际上意味着学生需要比过去学到更多，而不是更少。这才是真正的巨大挑战。我们如何加速学生在教育结束后所能做到的事情？在这个世界中，受过良好教育（不是被良好认证，而是真正受过良好教育，懂得如何辨别）的人与不懂辨别的人之间的差距将是巨大的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ben: right? You want to be able to decide. You want to be able to participate, to govern, to vote. And the discernment not in the black and white because it's obvious when something is true or false or at least it used to be but in the black and gray when there's certainly wrong answers though again we are getting worse and worse in identifying what wrong answers are and there are many potentially correct answers. An AI is going to produce in a blink of an eye a whole number of completely plausible scenarios. And so like what the video said, which I disagree with, it's not about knowing how to ask a question. It's knowing how to evaluate the answer that comes out of that asked question. The ability to to discern actually means that students would need to learn significantly more than they did in the past, not less. And that really is the big challenge. How do we turbocharge what it is that students are able to do coming out of education? and the disparity in that world between those who are well-educated, not well certified, well educated, actually know how to discern versus those that don't is going to be colossal.</p>
</details>

主持人: 谢谢。Isabelle，你在**斯坦福大学**（Stanford University: 一所位于美国加州的顶尖私立研究型大学）工作了几年。你未来的大学会是什么样子？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moderator: Thank you. Isabelle, you have worked for Stanford for several years. What is your uh future university look like? Yeah, I would love to see universities take advantage universities and by the way innovators in the room take advantage of um one major demographic and then work force change that's happening under that's already underway which is that we are living longer lives uh all around this planet and uh universities have tended to focus on one specific age group which are those generally 18 to 25 plus year old um young adults when in fact you have this um entire demographic that's growing uh that's also we look looking at continuous continuous and lifelong learning. So I think there's a huge opportunity that uh universities and new models of adult learning should take advantage of. Um it's also the nice thing about it is that also consistent with what we are seeing in the future of work or this future that's already here where um the number of occupations that any one of us will hold in the future will continue increasing and rising. So not only discernment um which will be key and critical thinking and all these uh uh critical skills but also adaptability um and frankly upskilling and reskilling that will need to happen a lot more in our future. So I would love to see um and there are already many models that are focused on this but universities and new models uh focus on these um older adults that will need uh more more and more uh and want to continue learning.</p>
</details>

Isabelle: 是的，我希望看到大学，顺便说一句，在座的创新者们，能够利用一个正在发生的主要人口结构和劳动力变化，即我们在这个星球上都活得更久了。大学倾向于关注一个特定的年龄段，即通常18到25岁及以上的年轻人，而实际上，我们有一个不断增长的整体人口群体，他们也在寻求**持续学习**（Continuous Learning: 指在整个职业生涯中不断获取新知识和技能）和**终身学习**（Lifelong Learning: 指个人在不同年龄段和生活阶段持续学习的过程）。所以我认为大学和成人学习的新模式应该抓住这个巨大的机会。它的好处还在于，这也与我们正在看到的工作未来，或者说已经到来的未来相一致，即我们每个人未来将从事的职业数量将持续增加。因此，不仅是辨别能力——这将是关键——以及批判性思维和所有这些关键技能，还有**适应性**（Adaptability: 指个体或系统在面对新情况、变化或挑战时调整自身以有效应对的能力），以及坦率地说，在未来我们需要更多地进行**技能提升**（Upskilling: 提高现有技能以适应工作变化）和**技能再培训**（Reskilling: 学习全新技能以从事不同工作）。所以我希望看到——而且已经有很多模式专注于此——大学和新模式能够关注这些需要越来越多学习并希望继续学习的年长成年人。

</details>

主持人: 这是一个很好的观点。你呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moderator: That's a very good point. What about you?</p>
</details>

Esther: 我非常务实，因为我是一名老师，我可以告诉你们，在大学里，大多数老师和教授都采用讲座形式，而改变旧的行为模式是非常困难的。所以，你将如何改变这一点？这是我所担忧的事情。事实证明，讲座是教育效率最低的方式，人们在讲座中听到的内容只能记住1%。效率第二低的方式是读书，我认为他们能保留大约5%。那么，最有效的方式是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Esther: So I'm very practical because I'm a teacher and I can tell you uh in the university the majority of teachers professors lecture and it's very hard to change old patterns of behavior and so how are you going to change that that's the thing that I am concerned about turns out that lecture is the least effective way to educate people remember 1% % of what they heard in a lecture. The second least effective way is reading a book. That's I think they retain about 5%. So what is the most effective way?</p>
</details>

Esther: 最有效的方式是**同伴协作**（Peer-to-peer: 指个体之间直接互动和学习）的**项目式学习**（Project-based learning: 一种教学方法，学生通过长时间探索真实世界的问题和挑战来获取知识和技能）。当你和同伴一起做你想做的事情，一个你自己想出来的项目时，你就会记住。所以我认为AI可以做的是帮助孩子们团队合作完成项目，并帮助他们理解错误是什么，他们不应该做什么等等。我认为所有的AI互动都应该以小组形式进行，两到三人一组，因为这样我们就是在训练孩子们适应真实世界的工作。你们所有人都在团队中工作，我相信没有人是完全独自工作的。所以，为什么不训练孩子们适应他们毕业后将要面对的世界呢？训练他们在团队中，在他们个人关心的项目上工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Esther: Most effective is peerto-peer projectbased learning. When you do something that you want to do together with your peers, a project you come up with yourself, then you remember. So what I think AI can do is help teams of kids working on projects and help them understand what the mistakes are, what the things are that they should not do or whatever. And I think all AI, all interaction should be done in groups. Group of two or three because we're then training kids to work in the real world. All of you work in teams. I'm sure that none of you are working totally by yourself. So why not train the kids for the world that exists, the world after they go to school. train them to work in groups on projects that they personally care about.</p>
</details>

Esther: 此外，我也非常现实地认为，改变学校就像改变教堂一样。明白吗？永远不会发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Esther: Also, I'm very realistic that changing the school, it's kind of like changing the church. Okay? Never going to happen.</p>
</details>

Esther: 所以，我可能不应该说“永远”，但确实有点难。因此，我认为我们应该一次只改变一小部分，也许是20%的学校时间，然后可能再增加到30%。让我们看看我们能做些什么来真正改变学校，让更多的孩子能够进行有意义的学习。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Esther: So, may I shouldn't say never, but it's a little hard. So, I think we should change just a small percentage, maybe 20% of the school time at once and then maybe move to 30%. Let's see what we can do to actually change the school so that more kids can do at learning that matters.</p>
</details>

### 大学学位价值的演变

主持人: 非常感谢。我完全同意。当你说改变学校系统非常困难时，特别是在今天，我们实际上仍然拥有这种非常线性的学习路径，从K12到高等教育。人们获得高中毕业证书，然后是学士学位，接着是硕士学位和博士学位。那么，在你们看来，未来这些学位的价值会如何？你们认为它们还会拥有那么大的价值吗？或者你们认为会有新的东西出现？会有新的学习途径出现吗？谁想回答这个问题？你们所有人都可以。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moderator: Well, thank you so much. Actually, I can't agree more. Um when you say like it's very difficult to change the school system and especially nowadays actually we are still having this is this very much linear learning journeys uh from K12 to higher education. uh people collect high school diploma um um um a bachelor degree and then master degree and doctor degree. So uh in your uh uh perspective, what do you think about how the future will hold the values for those degrees? Uh do you think they will still have those uh that much value or you think something new will come up? Some new learning pathways will come up and who want to take the question? All of you guys actually you can you can pick it up. Yeah, if you want.</p>
</details>

Esther: 抱歉，我认为这些学位的价值将会降低，只要这些学位没有与现实世界联系起来，没有与你实际能做的事情联系起来，以使现实世界变得更好。所以我认为我们需要改变我们的教育方式，我认为所有大学的每一门课程都应该包含一个项目式学习的元素，让孩子们可以一起工作。我的一个孙辈在**加州大学伯克利分校**（UC Berkeley: 一所位于美国加州的顶尖公立研究型大学）读书。我可以直接告诉你们，那里的课程大约有500人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Esther: Well, I sorry to say I think that the value of these degrees is going to be diminished as long as those degrees are not tied to the real world and are not tied to things that you can actually do to make the real world better. So I think we need to change the way we educate and I think every single class in all universities should have a project-based element that kids can work together. So one of my grandchildren goes to UC Berkeley. I can just tell you that the classes there are about 500</p>
</details>

Esther: 太大了。500人。他们坐在那里听讲座。实际上，我可以说，大多数孩子都在思考他们听完讲座后要做什么。所以，我们需要做些别的事情。给他们一个机会，让他们在团队中研究他们正在学习的任何科目。我认为这很重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Esther: too big. 500. They're sitting there listening to a lecture. Actually, I can tell you both most of those kids are thinking about what they're going to do after they get out of the lecture. So, we need to do something else. Give them an opportunity to work on whatever subject it is that they're studying in teams. And that's what I think is important.</p>
</details>

Isabelle: 我认为四年制学位将继续对某些人保持很大价值，然后我们将看到替代性证书的持续兴起，这些证书更侧重于技能。我的意思是，未来已经向我们展示，将会有越来越多的小型证书或携带技术技能的证书正在兴起，即使在今天，随着AI的发展也是如此。所以我认为未来这可能是两者的结合。我对此抱有希望，因为我并不那么消极，因为我在斯坦福大学教授的课程就是项目式的。所以也许我已经看到Esther的一些愿景正在大型大学中实现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Isabelle: I I think that the four-year degree will continue holding a lot of value for some uh people um and then you we will see continued rise of alternative credentials um that are much more focused on skills. I mean the future is um um showing us already that they will be uh more and more smaller credentials or carrier technical skills that are rising uh already today with AI. So I think this will probably be a mix of the two in our future. Um and I'm I'm hopeful as um you know I'm not as negative because I'm teaching at Stanford the class that's project based. Uh so maybe I'm seeing already some some elements of Estelle's vision happening um in big universities.</p>
</details>

Ben: 这里有人知道吗？如果你回顾30年前**常春藤盟校**（Ivy League: 由美国东北部八所历史悠久的著名大学组成的体育联盟，也代指这些顶尖学府）的入学新生，常春藤及其他顶尖大学，入学新生中大多数人唯一的共同特征是什么？

Ben: 在AI出现之前的世界里，雇佣非常富有的人的蠢孩子是没问题的，因为他们可能比那些不富裕但有才华的学生生产力低20%。

<p class="english-text">Ben: And in the world before AI, that's crazy. to hire the idiot children of very rich people was fine because they were maybe 20% less productive than deserving students who weren't born into wealth.</p>

<p class="english-text">Esther: But that's not true for UC Berkeley. The UC</p>

Ben: 是的。所以那不一样。不同的组织。因此，过去雇佣那些人脉广但有点笨的人，成本非常低。在AI的世界里，如果你的员工基础不能在人均基础上比现有员工多产10倍，你的公司就会倒闭。这可能不是明年，也不是后年，但肯定在十年之内。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Ben: Yeah. So that's different. Different organization. And so you have a a a very low tax in the past on hiring well-connected kind of dumb people. In the world of AI, when your employee base is not producing 10x on a per person basis of what the current employee does, your company is out of business. Now this may not be next year, the year after, but certainly within a decade.</p>

Ben: 因此，学位的**信号价值**（Signaling Value: 指文凭或证书向雇主传递的关于持有者能力和素质的信息），它在经验上对其毕业生没有任何好处，零好处，将迅速与其真实产出相匹配。这些学位的信号价值将变成负面，只要这些机构不提供真正的教育。在一个你不需要去上课（因为讲座毫无用处），你不需要在考试中做任何事情（因为36分就能让你得到A，因为有**曲线评分**（Curve Grading: 一种调整学生分数的方法，使分数分布符合预设的曲线，例如正态分布）），并且你不能不及格的世界里，学位的价值将反映在社会中。事实上，这就是我们今天所看到的。对美国高等教育的广泛攻击，无论你是否同意这些策略——我碰巧不同意——但今天大学发生的事情，之所以没有公开的讨论，是因为我们对这些机构失去了信心，这将在就业中得到体现。

<p class="english-text">Ben: And so the signaling value of a degree which adds impirically no benefit to its graduates, zero, is going to quickly match its real output. The signaling value of these degrees is going to become a negative so long as those institutions do not educate. And in a world where you do not have to go to class because the lectures are useless, you don't have to do anything in the exam because a 36 will get you an 36 out of 100 correct will get you an A because of a curve. And where you cannot flunk anything, the value of that degree is going to be reflected in society. And in fact, that is what we are seeing today. the broad attack on American higher education whether you agree with those tactics or not I happen to not agree with them but there is a reason there is not a public outro uh outro about what's happening today to universities it's because we have lost faith in those institutions and that will be reflected in employment</p>

### AI时代的核心技能与能力

主持人: 非常有趣的分享，非常感谢。抛开学位不谈，我个人认为，最重要的永远是技能和能力。在AI世界里，我想问你们三位，你们认为我们需要具备哪些最重要的技能和能力，才能帮助我们在AI世界中保持相关性和竞争力？Ben，你拿着麦克风，你可以开始。

<p class="english-text">Moderator: very interesting sharing thank you so much and putting degrees aside, uh, in my personal opinion, I think the most important thing will always be skills and the competencies. Um, and in the AI world, I like to ask you three, what do you think will be the most important skills and the competencies we need to have to help us stay relevant and also competitive in the AI world? Um, Ben, you have the microphone. You can start.</p>
</details>

Ben: 嗯，当我建立Minerva大学时，我们确定了80多种这样的技能和能力，它们构成了我们的核心课程。现实情况是，为了能够理解你周围的世界，你不能真正将你的需求和能力提炼成非常狭窄的东西。现实情况是，你必须成为一个**系统思考者**（Systems Thinker: 能够理解事物之间相互关联和相互作用，并从整体角度分析问题的人）。如果你想系统地理解事物，你必须接受一个提议的解决方案或一组数据，你必须将其分解为有意义的组成部分。然后你必须能够重新组合这些组成部分，并提出一个独特的解决方案。你必须将这个独特的解决方案付诸实施，并理解它在现实世界中实际实施时会发生什么。可能会出现哪些意想不到的后果或第二、第三级效应？然后你必须能够解释你所提出的东西。否则，你提出的任何东西都是无关紧要的。这个过程包含了数十种技能。数十种。你不仅要知道这些技能是什么，不仅要能够熟练运用它们，而且还要知道如何在截然不同的情境中运用它们，因为你不知道你将遇到什么样的情境。为了做到这一点，这需要多年的学习、实践和有意识的**重新情境化**（Recontextualization: 将某个概念、技能或知识从其原始情境中取出，并应用于新的、不同的情境中）。当然，这就是我们在Minerva所做的，但这不是传统教育机构的设置方式。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Ben: Well, when when I built Manurva University, um we identified more than 80 of these skills and competencies which made up our core curriculum. And the reality is that in order to be able to understand the world around you, you cannot really distill your uh your needs, your capabilities into something very narrow. The reality is you have to be a systems thinker. And if you want to be able to understand things systematically, you have to take a proposed solution or a set of data, you have to break it down into a component parts that make sense. You have to then be able to reformulate those component parts and come up with a unique solution. You have to take that unique solution and understand what happens when you actually implement it in the real world. what are unintended consequences or second or third order effects that can come up withh with that? And you have to then be able to explain what it is that you've come up with. Otherwise, anything you've come up with is irrelevant. And that process has dozens of skills that are built into it. Dozens. And you not only have to know what those skills are, you not only have to be able to become an expert at deploying them, but you have to be able to know how to deploy them in radically different context because you don't know what is the context that you're going to encounter it in. And in order to do that, that takes years of study, practice, and deliberate recontextualization. And that's of course what what we've done at Manurva, but it is not how traditional education institutions are are set up.</p>

主持人: Esther，你刚才想说什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moderator: Esther, you about to say something?</p>
</details>

Esther: 是的。我认为所有从学校毕业的孩子都没有足够的**社会情感技能**（Social Emotional Skills: 指个体理解和管理情绪、设定和实现积极目标、感受和表达同情心、建立和维持积极关系以及做出负责任决策的能力）训练。他们不知道如何与他人合作。这就是为什么我认为与他人合作非常重要。**谷歌**（Google: 一家美国跨国科技公司，以其搜索引擎、云计算、人工智能等产品和服务而闻名）关注的其中一件事就是团队合作以及与团队中的其他人合作。许多最令人惊叹的想法都源于团队合作。但你必须练习。你知道，作为孩子，你从小就学习这些技能，这就是为什么我认为让他们在团队中一起工作非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Esther: Well, I Yes. I think that all kids coming out of school don't have enough training for social emotional skills. They don't know how to work with each other. And so that's why I think it's really important to work with each other. And one of the things Google focuses on is teamwork and working with other people in on the team. And some of the most amazing ideas have come out of teamwork. But you have to practice. You you know as a child you learn these skills as a child and that's why I think it's really important for them to work together in teams.</p>
</details>

Isabelle: 是的，我实际上想接着Esther的评论。所以现在随着AI的兴起，我们显然越来越需要我们所有人变得越来越**人性化**（Human: 指具备人类特有的情感、思维、社交等能力）。所以**人类技能**（Human Skills: 指那些机器难以复制的、与人际互动、情感理解、创造性思维等相关的技能）正在兴起。当然，协作的概念，或者我所说的**关系智能**（Relational Intelligence: 指理解、建立和维护有效人际关系的能力），正在兴起。因为我们的经济将越来越要求沟通和协作作为顶尖技能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Isabelle: Yes. I was I was actually going to build on on Ether uh Esther's comment. So right now with the rise of AI, we clearly have an increase in the need for all of us to be actually increasingly human. Uh so human skills are on the rise. Certainly the concept of collaboration or what I call relational intelligence is on the rise. um as our economies will be increasingly already uh uh demanding communication collaboration as top skills.</p>
</details>

Isabelle: 第二个要素是适应性。这有点接近Ben所描述的，但我认为适应性将——适应性实际上与**创造力**（Creativity: 指产生新颖且有价值的想法、解决方案或作品的能力）紧密相关，这是在座许多企业家所具备的技能。但这种适应性的概念是我们会越来越多看到的。然后还有第三个，我们已经在所有这些评论中都提到了，那就是**学会学习**（Learning How to Learn: 指掌握学习过程本身的方法和策略，从而更有效地获取和应用知识）。我的意思是，这种**元认知**（Metacognition: 指对自身思维过程的认知和控制，即“思考思考”）能力，我们人类所拥有的，将变得越来越重要。所以问题是，我们如何教授更多这些技能，但我认为这三项将继续兴起。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Isabelle: The second element is adaptability. Um, which gets a little bit to what Ben described, but uh I think adaptability will adaptability is actually very very closely tied with creativity, which is a skill that many of you entrepreneurs have in this room. Um, but this this concept of being adaptive is a is one that we'll see more and more. And then there is a third one which we touched on already on throughout all all these comments which is learning how to learn. I mean this capacity this metacognition uh that we humans hold uh will continue being increasingly important. So question is then how do we teach more of those skills but uh those three I think will continue rising.</p>
</details>

Esther: 我可以补充一点吗？大多数失败的公司，大多数初创公司——90%都失败了。你们知道他们失败的主要原因吗？缺乏沟通技巧，人们无法和睦相处。所以，如果他们因此失败，我们为什么不教授这些技能呢？为什么大学不允许孩子们有更多的互动和社交技能呢？所以，我建议大家阅读**约翰·杜尔**（John Doerr: 一位著名的风险投资家和作家）的书。你们知道约翰·杜尔是谁吗？是的。因为我认为学习如何赋能你合作的人很重要。你知道，领导者非常重要，那个人需要学习如何赋能他们正在合作的人，这涉及到社会情感训练。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Esther: So can I just say that most companies that fail most startups so 90% of them fail and you know the main reason they fail lack of communication skills lack of people being able to get along so if they fail for that reason why aren't we teaching those skills why why are universities not allowing kids to have more interaction and social skills so um that's you know I also recommend that everybody that he read John Door's book. Do you know who John Door is? Yeah. So, because I think it's important to learn how to empower the people you work with. You know, the leader is really important and that the person needs to learn how to empower the people that they are working with and that is involved in social emotional training.</p>
</details>

主持人: 我完全同意你们三位刚才提到的所有技能、能力和才干。我认为为了帮助我们的学习者发展所有这些能力和才干，我们需要给予他们指导、建议、支持，以及启发。我们都知道，这些都是我们优秀的老师一直擅长提供的。但是谈到老师，我们也从视频片段中听到，有些教室根本没有老师。所以，实际上，这些天我听到越来越多的人担忧，未来AI是否会最终完全取代教室里的所有老师。所以我想听听你们对此的看法。也许我可以从Esther开始，因为你当老师很多年了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moderator: I totally agree with all the skills and competencies capabilities you three just mentioned and I think to help our learners to develop all those capabilities and the competencies uh we need to give them guidance um advice support and also inspirations and we all know those are the things um that our great teachers are always good at uh providing. Uh but talking about teachers, uh we also uh heard something from the uh video clip saying some classrooms uh has no teachers at all. Um so um actually like I've heard more and more concerns these days about whether um in the future AI will completely eventually replace all the teachers in the classrooms. So I'd like to hear what's your take on this. Maybe I can start from uh Esther as you have been a teacher for many many years.</p>
</details>

### 教师角色的未来：AI是替代还是赋能？

Esther: 我认为老师的角色非常重要，我不认为技术可以取代老师的角色。你需要一个活生生的人在那里。所以我确实认为可以学习很多额外的技能，但我认为老师需要在那儿支持学生，帮助他们理解自己在做什么。即使只有一小部分时间。也许老师可以被称为教练。你知道，有些人就是这么说的。我的班级非常非常大。一个班有70个孩子。他们之所以那么大，是因为孩子们是团队合作的。每个小组都有四五个人。所以对我来说点名很容易，因为你只要叫第一组，第二组等等。但他们也学到了很多如何与他人相处。我告诉你，当他们九年级的时候，他们不知道怎么做。但到他们十二年级的时候，如果他们做得足够久，他们就知道了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Esther: I think the role of the teacher is really important and I don't think that that technology can take over the role of the teacher. You need a human being there. So I do think that a lot of additional skills can be learned but I think the teacher needs to be there and support the students and help them understand what they're doing. even if it's um you know just a small percentage of the time. Uh maybe the teacher could be called a coach. You know that's what some of the people are saying. My classes were very very large. They were 70 kids in one class. And the reason that they were that big is the kids worked in teams. Every group there were teams of four and five in every group. And so it was easy for me to call roll because, you know, you just call team one, team two, and so forth. But they also learned a lot about how to get along with each other. And I'll tell you, when they're in the ninth grade, they don't know how. By the time they're in the 12th grade, if they've been doing this long enough, they know how.</p>

主持人: Isabelle。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moderator: Isaba.</p>
</details>

Isabelle: 是的，我的意思是，我们的大脑是深度社会化的。作为人类物种，我们天生就渴望连接。所以我们需要周围的人际关系，包括老师和其他人，同伴，以及周围的其他人，才能学习和成长。实际上，孤立与主要的心理健康问题有关，我们已经看到了这一点。所以，无论如何，关系对于学习和成长都至关重要。我也非常同意我的朋友Esther的观点，老师将继续存在。我们需要老师，我们需要为老师配备合适的AI工具，这样AI实际上可以支持老师变得越来越善于处理人际关系，也许可以通过帮助处理一些行政任务和可以腾出时间的事情。但老师将继续存在，因为作为人类，我们的大脑是深度社会化的。随着我们传递知识的方式可能随着这些技术的发展而演变，老师的整体角色可能会演变。但那种一个导师、一个孩子、一个AI导师、一个孩子，没有任何人际关系的想法，我个人不认同这种愿景。因为那将是一个我不想生活的世界。我不想让我的孩子生活在一个他们与其他人没有连接，没有蓬勃发展的世界里。所以，我认为老师将继续存在，AI有望使教学成为有史以来最好的职业之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Isabelle: Yeah. I mean, our brains are deeply deeply social. Uh we are wired to connect as a human species. So we need um human relationships around us including teachers and other other people, peers uh other people surrounding us for all of us to learn and to thrive. Um actually isolation is connected to major mental health issues um which we are already seeing. So uh anyway relationships matter tremendously for learning and thriving. Um and I also believe very similar to my friend Esther that uh teachers are here to stay. Uh we need teachers um uh we need to equip teachers with the right AI tools so that AI can actually support teachers in u in being increasingly uh more relational uh by maybe helping on some admin tasks and things that uh can free up time. Um but teachers are here to stay because our brains are deeply deeply social as humans. The whole of teachers may evolve as the way that we are transferring knowledge may evolve with some of these technologies. Um but the idea of one tutor, one child, one AI tutor, one child without any human relationships, I don't see that vision myself. uh because that would be a world where I don't want to live in. I don't want to have my children live in uh in this world where they are not connected with other humans where they are uh not flourishing. Um so um I I think that teachers will remain and um AI will hopefully make actually teaching one of the best profession it has ever been.</p>
</details>

Ben: 我将给你们一个数学或统计学的回答。老师，像任何人群一样，是围绕着**正态分布曲线**（Normal Curve / Normal Distribution: 一种常见的概率分布，其图形呈钟形，表示大多数数据点集中在平均值附近，而离平均值越远的数据点越少）分布的。唯一的问题是，教学正态分布曲线的中点是无效的。这是一个事实。事实是，在座的任何一个人都可以想想你在大学里上过的一门课，假设不是上学期，如果现在立刻出一份期末考试，我给你计时通过那份考试，你们都会不及格，因为你们没有学到它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ben: I'll give you a mathematical um or statistical response to that question. Teachers like any population are distributed around a normal curve. Um the only problem is that the midpoint of the normal curve of teaching is ineffective. That's a fact. The fact of the matter is is that anybody here can think about a class you took in college, assuming it wasn't last semester, and if a final exam were to be produced this instant and I would time you on passing that exam, you would all flunk because you didn't learn it.</p>
</details>

Ben: 高中和初中也是如此。小学则不然，你确实学会了阅读、写作和基础数学。但**正态分布**（Normal Distribution: 同“正态分布曲线”）的问题在于，如果你的中点是无效的，你必须偏离平均值一个**标准差**（Standard Deviation: 衡量数据分散程度的统计量）才能达到好的教学水平。这意味着偏离平均值一个标准差及以上，大约是16%到17%。16%到17%的老师是好的、非常好的或卓越的。问题是超过80%的老师是无效的或更糟。只要这种情况存在，AI就会取代老师。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ben: And so, and that is true of high school, that is true of middle school. It's not true of elementary school. you do wind up learning to read, write, um do basic math. But the problem with a normal distribution where your midpoint is ineffective is you've got to get a standard deviation away from the mean in order to get to good teaching. And that means that one standard deviation uh from the mean in one direction and above is roughly 16 17%. 16 17% of teachers are good or supremely good extraordinary problem is more than 80% are ineffective or much worse so long as that is the case AI will replace teachers</p>
</details>

Ben: 如果我们改革系统，真正让老师的中点变得有效，让超过80%的老师是有效到优秀的，而少于20%的老师是差到糟糕的，那么未来老师就会有自己的角色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ben: and if we reform the system to actually allow teachers to have that midpoint become effective where more than 80% are effective to great and less than 20% are bad to terrible then there will be a role for teachers in the future.</p>
</details>

主持人: 我非常同意Ben刚才分享的观点。我个人认为AI不会完全取代所有老师，特别是那些优秀的老师，AI会赋能他们，让他们变得更好。但是，那些不了解AI或不知道如何使用技术的老师，他们将被会使用AI的老师所取代。好的，实际上，我们的时间到了。我认为AI与教育是一个如此宏大的话题，我们无法在30到40分钟内完成对话。我希望我们的小组讨论能给大家带来一些新的视角和一些可以借鉴的建议。非常感谢你们的见解、观点和智慧，希望大家享受活动的剩余部分。谢谢。

<p class="english-text">Moderator: I can't agree more on what Ben just shared with us. Uh my personal view I think AI won't completely replace all the teachers especially those good teachers and AI will empower them to make them even better. Um but AI um like teachers they do not know about AI or they do not know how to use technologies they will be replaced by teachers who do okay actually um our time is up um I think AI and education is such a big topic we can't finish uh the conversation within 30 40 minutes and I hope our panel has uh given you guys some new perspectives and also some uh advice to carry forward and thank you so much for your insights and uh perspectives and also of wisdom and I hope you guys enjoy the rest of the uh event.
