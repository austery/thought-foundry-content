### 市场反应与美元地位

**Manny Roman**: 当你观察市场的反应程度时，其实反应并不大。我的意思是，昨天十年期**债券收益率**上升了 5 到 6 个基点，股市下跌了 2%。这并不算是一场“地震”。因此，我认为市场是非常理性的，基本上消化了大量的噪音并能看透本质。只有当市场真正担心某些事情时，你才会看到大得多的反应。第二点，我认为货币几乎没有波动。我今天早上看了欧元和英镑，表现得非常平稳。至于远离美元的趋势，作为一种长期趋势，想要分散投资、减少对美元的依赖是有道理的，但**美元**仍然是全球的储备货币。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Manny Roman**: When you look at how much the market reacted, they didn't react that much. I mean, bond yields went up 5 or 6 bips yesterday on the ten year. And the stock market is is down 2%. I mean, it's it's it's, it's not exactly right. An earthquake. And so I do think that, the market is very rational and essentially discount a lot of the nose and look through it. The day where, the market is really concerned about something, you're going to see a much bigger reaction. That's the first point. The second point, I think, is, the currency barely move. I mean, I was looking at euro and sterling this morning. I mean, we, we we flat as a pancake. And so the move away from the dollar. Yes. As, a a secular trend, the fact that you want to diversify away from the dollar mix makes sense. And you want to have other currency, you the dollar, but the dollar remains the reserve currency of the world.

**Tracy Alloway**: 欢迎收听新一期的 **Odd Lots** 播客。我是 Tracy Alloway，这位是 Joe Weisenthal。Joe，它回来了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Hello, and welcome to another episode of the Odd Lots podcast. I'm Tracy Alloway and I'm Joe Weisenthal. Joe. It's back.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 什么回来了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: What's back?

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: “**抛售美国**”交易（Sell America trade）。昨天我们看到市场出现了相当大的抛售，有趣的是这是美国资产的“三连杀”：**标普 500 指数**下跌，债券收益率上升，美元指数也下跌。人们在讨论这是否是“抛售美国”交易的开始或重启。这一切都发生在特朗普对格陵兰岛的威胁以及大量地缘政治风险的背景下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: It's back. No, it was South America trade. Oh, the sell America. Yeah. Various flavors of what the comeback could have been, but all seem to be converging at one. Yeah, I should have been more clear. So we are recording this on January 21st, and this comes a day after we saw a pretty big sell off in the market. What was interesting about that sell off is it was a trifecta of U.S. assets. So you have the S&P 500 down, bond yields up and the dollar index down. Yeah as well. And so obviously people are talking about is this the start or the restart of the sell America trade. All of this is coming in the context of Trump's threats against Greenland. Lots of geopolitical risk.

</details>

### 日本债市与收益率压力

**Joe Weisenthal**: 没错。虽然欧洲在格陵兰岛、北约等问题上的紧张局势非常重要，但还有日本因素。日本债券收益率正在上升，这可能与新首相的“**安倍经济学 2.0**”有关。昨天故事的一部分是美国和日本长端利率的急剧上升，日本 40 年期国债（JGB）收益率显然有史以来首次触及 4%。在美国，十年期利率最近又回到了 4.3% 左右。长端利率持续走高，人们似乎在避开传统的避险资产。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah, right. And it probably won't change on a dime. And the reason is because while yes, it is true that probably the, you know, tensions in Europe over Greenland, NATO, etc. are very important. Mark Carney having given a pretty extraordinary speech yesterday. There's also the Japan element and the rising bond yields in Japan, which is related to, you know, I don't know, Abenomics 2.0, perhaps with the, new prime minister and so forth. And so then part of the story yesterday and you mentioned the trifecta selloff, but part of the story yesterday fairly sharp, increase lately in, long end rates in the US and, Japan, the 40 year bond and JGB, which never existed up until like 2007, apparently hit 4% for the first time in history. You know, we were looking at some 4%, ten year rates, as recently as October in the US, actually, maybe even as recently as December. Now we're closer to 4.3 again. So like, you know, though, if people keep thinking like mortgages are going to come down, etc., and not going out looking like. And so there is a lot going on in terms of potential theoretical drivers, etc.. But the important thing is that rates at the long end keep pushing up and people seem to be avoiding traditional safe havens.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 这就是争论所在。Scott Bessent 在达沃斯认为美国国债的抛售只是“日本效应”，而其他人则认为这是**地缘政治风险溢价**。我们请到了完美的嘉宾，**Pimco** 的首席执行官 **Manny Roman**。Manny，欢迎来到 Odd Lots。当你观察今天的债券收益率时，你认为其中有多少是地缘政治风险溢价，有多少只是日本抛售的延续？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Well, this is the debate, right? So Scott Bezzant, in Davos, like a lot of people at the moment, he thinks the U.S. Treasury sell off was just, you know, the Japan effect. Yeah. And others think it's a geopolitical risk premium. So, you know, we need to get into all of this. Yes. And we have the perfect guest, really the perfect guest. We're going to be speaking with Manny Roman. He is, of course, the CEO of Pimco. So Manny, thank you so much for coming on Odd Lots. Thank you for having me. Why don't we start with that last question when you're looking at bond yields today, how much of that do you see as the geopolitical risk premium. Versus just a follow through from the Japan selloff?

</details>

**Manny Roman**: 我认为诚实的回答是两者兼而有之。但正如我刚才所说，市场非常理性，基本上会过滤掉噪音。只有当市场真正担心某事时，反应才会大得多。此外，货币几乎没动。虽然远离美元是一个长期趋势，分散投资是有道理的，但美元仍是全球储备货币。我们倾向于对听到的消息过度反应，但我昨晚看标普 500 指数时在想，虽然周二下跌了 2%，但在过去 15 年惊人表现的背景下，这并不算什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Manny Roman**: Well, I think I think the honest answer is it's a mix of both. But, when you look at when I was listening to you and when you look at how much the market reacted, they didn't react that much. I mean, bond yields went up 5 or 6 bips yesterday on the ten year. And the stock market is is down 2%. I mean, it's it's it's, it's not exactly right. An earthquake. And so I, I do think that, the market is very rational and essentially discount a lot of the nose and look through it. The day where, the market is really concerned about something, you're going to see a much bigger reaction. That's the first point. The second point, I think, is, the currency barely move. I mean, I was looking at euro and sterling this morning. I mean, we, we we flat as a pancake. And so the move away from the dollar. Yes. As, a a secular trend, the fact that you want to diversify away from the dollar mix makes sense. And you want to have other currency, you the dollar, but the dollar remains the reserve currency of the world. And so I think all of this was a grain of salt and, and, and, you know, we, we, we animals in the best possible way and we look at the screen and we tend to overreact to what we hear and so on and so forth.

### Pimco 的投资策略与规模优势

**Joe Weisenthal**: 那么，我们从这些长端曲线的持续上行压力中能读到什么更大的故事？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: On the other hand, this upward pressure that we continue to see on the long end of curves, setting aside one week or whatever, whether we're talking about Japan, the U.S., elsewhere, like, what is the bigger story that we're, like, taking from?

</details>

**Manny Roman**: 我认为日本的情况非常特殊。先说美国，过去一年半利率基本处于一个区间内。我认为**固定收益**提供了一个非常好的投资切入点。标普 500 指数非常昂贵，投资者会看向长期固定收益，心想持有这类资产可以获得 6% 或 7% 的回报，这非常有吸引力。过去 12 个月 Pimco 的资金流入非常好，人们意识到可以通过固定收益获得类似股票的回报。只要这种情况持续，利率就会受到很大限制。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Manny Roman**: Well, I think I think Japan is quite, a, quite a peculiar situation. Okay, let's talk about top Hand. Let me start with the US because it's it's the easiest thing. Look, rates have been essentially in a range for the past year and a half. And I think I think the Treasury and the fed would be very focused on the long end of the curve. And I think that fixed income offer is a really good entry point in terms of investment. I mean, we talked about the S&P. The S&P is very expensive. Investors are going to look at, you know, long term fixed income and say, I can make 6 or 7% or holding a basket of fixed income that looks really attractive. And so I think every time you build back up, you see money coming back. You know, I talk about Pimco. The flows have been incredibly good over the past 12 months. You know, people have come and bought U.S. asset and and the trend is very is very clear. Nothing is changing. And we have people basically saying I can get, you know, equity like return using fixed income. And for as long as that remains the case, I think the rates have very bounded in terms of where they're going to go.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 谈谈日本吧，你上周刚从那里回来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Okay. Japan is a very, specific situation. I just came back from Japan last week. Oh, great. I mean, you feel you feel bullish.

</details>

**Manny Roman**: 我觉得遇到的每个人都看好股市。我 1987 年开始职业生涯，这是我第一次看到**日经指数**超过我入行时的水平。日本 20 年来一直试图重启通胀，现在终于在紧俏的劳动力市场中取得了一些进展。新首相非常明确要限制劳动力流入日本，这在中期是个问题，但从通胀压力来看，日本现在的通胀是长期以来最高的。此外，股市中出现了更多的**股东积极主义**，人们试图接管公司、打破财团，这比以往任何时候都更真实。再加上 AI 机器人趋势，日本擅长制造精密产品，这赋予了它竞争优势。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Manny Roman**: I think everyone you meet, is bullish equity. You know, I started my career in 1987. It's the first time that I see the Nikkei above when I started. I mean, it's it's it's it's unbelievable. But yes, you know, there is for the first time inflation and the get of the curve, is, is probably going to go higher. And that's probably overall a good thing. Now the super secular trend is the demographic pressures are a real problem a real problem. But the I think one of the thing we try to do is look at the liquid instruments. [...] I was surprised by, the fact that you have much more activism in the stock market, people to try to take ownership in a company. Yeah, trying to turn them around. Breaking down conglomerate. [...] And then when you think of the AI robotic trend, you know, the one thing Japan knows how to do is to make things and to make sophisticated, product and, and, and I think that all of a sudden there is a competitive edge that Japan has, in terms of a number of stock which looks attractive.

### 债务可持续性与财富税

**Tracy Alloway**: 债券抛售中有多少是因为通胀回归，有多少是因为对债务可持续性的担忧？日本一直是一个高负债国家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Just on the bond sell off. How much of that is the return or expected return of inflation versus Dutch sustainability concerns? Because this is the other thing that's been very long running in Japan. You always hear it's a heavily indebted country.

</details>

**Manny Roman**: 我曾和我们的首席经济学家 Rich Clarida 讨论过，如果我们看债务与家庭储蓄的比率，你会发现美国和日本都有大量的资金。在美国是婴儿潮一代，在日本是倾向于不消费的储蓄者。如果你相信财政政策，相信最终税收会提高，那么债务的可持续性就会变得不同。例如美国，婴儿潮一代拥有 80 万亿美元的财富，最终这些财富会流向下一代，也会流向国家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Manny Roman**: So I was I was talking with Rich Clarida, who is our chief economist, friend of the pod, as one of the fed. And I said to him, I said, you know, we tend to look, debt to GDP. What if we look, at debt to household savings? And then you realize for both the US and Japan that there's just a lot of money. Yeah. In the US was the baby boomer in Japan was savers who tend to not to spend enough. And if you believe in fiscal policy and the fact that eventually taxes will go higher, then I think that the dynamic becomes quite different. And you can have higher sustainability in terms of debt, because the ability to collect money is there. You look at the US, for example, you know, you could have at some point in time how your inheritance taxes, this $80 trillion of wealth in the baby boomers, eventually that will go to the next generation, but it would also go to the state.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 作为大资产管理公司的 CEO，你如何看待**财富税**？加州和欧洲都在讨论这个，人们在谈论搬到海湾地区以避税。你看到资金大规模转移了吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Do you might have put it on the sort of like CEO of a big asset manager hat? You know, in California there is talk about a wealth tax, etc. there's talk and, there's talk in Europe about wealth tax is there's people talk about, oh, when like set up my family office or whatever somewhere in the Gulf and avoid all this. What do you see on that front. Do you see money moving at a significant degree high? No. High net worth or ultra high net worth clients really thinking about where their money is domiciled in a different way.

</details>

**Manny Roman**: 我是法国人，所以我亲眼见过财富税的后果。结果是一场灾难，因为现实是人们可以移动。他们决定“用脚投票”，搬到了比利时或瑞士。财富税的效果是非常存疑的。在美国，各州之间存在竞争，你可以从加州搬到内华达州或奥斯汀。我们在奥斯汀设立了办公室，非常成功，那里有 500 人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Manny Roman**: So you knew there was something good about me is that I'm French. And so I've seen firsthand the experience of a wealth tax. Yeah. Tell us more about that. Well, it turned out to be a disaster because, the reality is people can move. And, they decided to vote with defeat, and they didn't believe that the government would keep the taxes. You know, historically, 2 or 3% of wealth. And they decided to go to Belgium or to Switzerland and to other places and so on. So I think the evidence in terms of how well wealth tax work is quite mixed. In California, you can cross to Nevada and, decide, do you want to live in Nevada? God forbid. But then you have to live in Nevada. But you got to live in Nevada. But there are many other places, and there's anecdotal evidence of people moving to Austin and setting themselves in Austin and so on, so forth.

### 抵押贷款市场与 AI 融资

**Tracy Alloway**: 让我们谈谈**抵押贷款**。Pimco 最近一直看好抵押贷款，特朗普政府也在努力降低抵押贷款利率。你如何看待政治端降低利率的努力与持续走高的长端收益率之间的紧张关系？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: I think you gave us a very polite prompt earlier to talk about mortgages and mortgage reform, and we should do that because I know that Pimco has been very bullish on mortgages recently. I see a Bloomberg headline just from last week saying Pimco sees mortgage rates easing on Fannie Freddie purchases. Those are part of the Trump administration's efforts to bring down mortgage rates. But, of course, at the same time, you know, we started out this conversation talking about the 30 year yield, which is ticking up. How are you thinking of, I guess, those two tensions in the market.

</details>

**Manny Roman**: 这是一个复杂的紧张关系。从美国政府的角度看，你肯定希望抵押贷款利率更低。30 年期抵押贷款和整个抵押贷款生态系统看起来很便宜，有很多值得购买的资产。我们确实认为政府的购买会有所帮助。至于政府想限制大资产管理公司购买单户住宅，这更多是出于民粹主义冲动。美国宏观上面临住房短缺，我们需要更多廉价住房，特别是**经济适用房**。这不应该是因为机构不该拥有单户住宅，而是因为我们需要更多房子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Manny Roman**: Look, I. It's a complicated tension and the if you put yourself into the shoes of the US administration, what looks clear to me is you want mortgage rate to be lower rather than higher. [...] mortgage. You know, 30 year mortgages and the whole mortgage ecosystem looks cheap and there's plenty to to buy. And it looks attractive. Yes. We do think that, you know, the purchase will help, in terms of attrition, but, I don't, you know, I don't know what I don't know. [...] the US if you look at it from a macro standpoint has a shortage of house. Right. So we need more homes. And the, the reality is when you look over the 30 year period, the only places where costs haven't gone down is building, you know, and the reality is we need more cheap houses, especially in affordable housing.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 谈到机器人，AI 在信贷市场正成为一股巨大的力量。很多大公司正在发行更多投资级债务（IG debt）。这对你来说如何改变了信贷市场？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: So, okay, speaking of robots, AI has come up a couple times in this conversation. One of the interesting things that's happening in the credit market right now is that AI is becoming a much bigger force when it comes to investment grade debt. So lots of big companies issuing even more into that particular market. How does that change the credit market, if at all, for you?

</details>

**Manny Roman**: 我们参与了一项超过 200 亿美元的超大型交易，用于建设**数据中心**。有些交易会非常有吸引力。大型数据中心的用户通常是评级较高的公司，如甲骨文（Oracle）等，它们拥有由市值支撑的资本结构，是非常安全的投资。**规模**是我们的竞争优势，我们有能力在这些机会出现时参与其中。并不是每个人都能接下 250 亿美元的单子。我们只做一件事：各种形式的固定收益。我们要在自己强项所在的地方赚钱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Manny Roman**: Well, I think you reported we try not to talk about single positions, but you reported that we got involved into a very large, 20 plus billion dollar transaction for, to build data center. And, some of these deals are going to be incredibly attractive and some won't be, and so I think we I think what's really interesting is the big data center. User may actually be a better rated company. And so, Oracle or MIT, or any of these company actually have a capital structure where they may need a lot of money, but the money is backed by market cap. [...] And so size is a competitive edge that plays well to our strength. [...] Well, not everyone can take $25 billion of a deal. True. And so I always say, you know, one of the thing was that we constantly think about is what's our competitive edge. And we big. So and we do one thing. We do fixed income in all shapes and form.

</details>

### AI 对资产管理的重塑

**Tracy Alloway**: 你如何将 AI 融入到你自己的工作流程和组织中？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Since we're on sort of CEO, executive level topics, just on AI, this is a question we've been asking a lot of our guests, but how are you incorporating AI, if at all, into your own workflow and organization?

</details>

**Manny Roman**: 对我们来说，这既是防御性机会也是进攻性机会。防御方面，它能显著提高生产力，从处理文档、创建营销内容到优化交易功能。任何能让这个“工厂”更简单、更高效、更安全的东西都是好事。合规也将从 AI 和**深度学习**中受益。进攻方面，我们可以使用**大语言模型**（LLM）从数据中提取可能被遗漏的洞察。例如在抵押贷款市场，将房屋图片、信用评分、就业历史等海量非完美匹配的数据结合起来，能给我们更精细的评估。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Manny Roman**: Oh, I think we I think for us the sort of defensive and offensive opportunity. So, the defensive one, it should increase significantly productivity in terms of everything we do from, the way we manipulate document, the way we create marketing, the way, we optimize our trade function. [...] Anything which makes the factory simpler, more efficient and safer is a really, really good thing. I would help to do this. [...] And then there's the offensive part where you sort of sit, okay, can I use, a large language model to try to extract from data inside an opportunity that I may have missed? [...] So when it's, you know, in the mortgage market, you have your house, your mortgage, your credit score, a picture of your house, your insurance, your employment history, your communication with your mortgage provider. All of these things, I think should give us a finer assessment in terms of what's happening.

</details>

### 财政政策与市场纪律

**Joe Weisenthal**: 为什么 **Liz Truss** 的财政政策被视为危险和鲁莽，而日本新首相的再通胀政策却让大家感到兴奋？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Why is it that, Liz Truss is like, okay, this was like a dangerous thing. She was like reckless, etc.. Whereas new Prime Minister of Japan comes in, takes talks about Reflationary policies. And you describe as like everyone is excited about Japan right now. What is the difference between the inflationary impulse that Liz Truss was expected to have, accelerated with the mini budget versus maybe the more benign reflation that you're mostly describing as a sort of positive development in Japan.

</details>

**Manny Roman**: 我认为 Liz Truss 当时同时推出了整个减税方案，这显然没有经过基本的数学计算来衡量它对政府支出的影响。市场突然看到了巨大的赤字，认为这不现实，长端曲线就疯了。财政政策真的很重要。Liz Truss 的方案显然没有得到英国财政部的认可。一旦你失去信誉，你就真的失去了信誉。市场会严厉惩罚那些尝试做它不想要的事情的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Manny Roman**: What I think I think what happened is she gave this whole tax package at the same time. So she wanted, you know, there was like this liberalization and dismemberment tax package where clearly someone had to kind of figure out the the very basic math in terms of what it did to, government, government spending. Yeah. And then all of a sudden you had a huge deficit that the market so and say, oh my God, there's no way you can do this. This is not realistic. And, and the back end of the curve just went crazy. I mean, at some point in time, fiscal policy really, really matters. [...] And somehow I think, I think the left hand in the right hand forgot to talk to each other. And they came up with a package which made no sense and clearly hadn't been blessed by the UK Treasury. And, and, and the market reacted incredibly strongly to that.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 最后一个问题，你是否在这个环境下卖出**波动率**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: I'll ask one more question, which, you know, I think when it comes to Pimco, I think it's often underappreciated how much of Pimco is about those sort of overlays on top of the fixed income positions? And so I have to channel my inner Bill gross here and ask, are you selling volatility into this particular environment?

</details>

**Manny Roman**: 我们一直在关注波动率。当我们发现机会时会卖出，这是一种风险溢价来源。但我更想强调的是，我们的表现是由 300 人的日常工作构成的。我们不相信那种“伟人从山上走下来”预言宏观趋势的模式，那行不通。重要的是保持极度的纪律，每天赚一点钱。我总是问基金经理：你为什么能赚钱？为什么这是**可重复的**？伟大的想法和从山上走下来的伟人并不那么可重复。你希望让过程尽可能工业化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Manny Roman**: Well, I think, I think we I think we look at volatility all the time. And I think when, when we find opportunity to sell volatility, we do and it's sort of unfun. I think we've done it for a very long time. [...] But it is it is a source of risk premium. And I think, I think we, we focus on it, I think we to kind of come back to this, we hit single. Right. And I think what makes up performance is really the work of 300 people on the day, never seen. But we hit a lot of single. Well. And when you put all this single together, the result is pretty good. The great man coming down from the mountain and thinking that all this great macro trend are going to happen, that doesn't quite work. It's it's really about being incredibly disciplined and essentially making a bit of money every single day was various different hello to ever. [...] I do think repeatability is, is, is is really, really important. You want to make the process as industrial as possible and sort of said, okay, those are all the level I have. And on average this is going to be pretty good.

</details>
