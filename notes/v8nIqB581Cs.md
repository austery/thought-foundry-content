title: 民主党议员称遭FBI调查，美国计划在加沙建设住房区
---
### 民主党议员称因呼吁拒绝非法命令而遭FBI调查

“我们的法律很明确，你可以拒绝非法命令。你必须拒绝非法命令。”上周发布视频，告知美国军队可以拒绝**非法命令**（illegal orders: 违反法律或道德原则的指令）的民主党**国会议员**（members of Congress）表示，他们目前正受到**FBI**（Federal Bureau of Investigation: 美国联邦调查局，负责调查联邦犯罪并维护国家安全）的调查。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders. You can refuse illegal orders. You must refuse illegal orders. The Democratic lawmakers who put out a video last week telling US troops that they could refuse illegal orders say they are now being investigated by the FBI.</p>
</details>

视频中，这六名国会议员都曾在美国军方或**中央情报局**（CIA: Central Intelligence Agency: 美国对外情报机构）服役。他们没有提及具体的命令或情境，而是重申了标准军事训练中的一条信息：美国军队有义务不服从来自其**指挥链**（chain of command: 军事或组织中的层级结构）的非法命令，这本质上是在说不要听从美国总统的命令。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the video, the six members of Congress, who all served in the military or the CIA themselves, didn't reference a specific order or scenario, but repeated a message that's part of standard military training that US troops are obligated not to follow illegal orders from their chain of command. when they say, you know, essentially don't follow the orders of the president of the United States.</p>
</details>

该视频立即在白宫引发轩然大波，特朗普总统指责这些议员犯有**煽动叛乱罪**（sedition: 煽动反抗政府或权威的非法行为），并分享了一篇社交媒体帖子，上面写着“绞死他们”。特朗普表示：“我会说他们有大麻烦了。我不是在威胁死亡，但我认为他们有大麻烦了。在过去，这可是死罪。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The video set off an immediate firestorm in the White House with President Trump accusing the lawmakers of sedition and sharing a social media post that said, "Hang them." I would say they're in serious trouble. I'm not threatening death, but I think they're in serious trouble. In the old days, it was death.</p>
</details>

这些议员表示，总统现在正利用联邦执法部门作为“恐吓和骚扰”他们的工具。他们称FBI已要求对他们进行约谈，尽管目前尚不清楚他们可能违反了哪些法律（如果有的话），但该局拒绝置评。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The lawmakers say that now the president is using federal law enforcement as a tool to quote intimidate and harass them. They say the FBI has requested interviews with them. Even though it's unclear what, if any, laws they may have violated, the bureau declined to comment.</p>
</details>

FBI介入的消息是在**五角大楼**（Pentagon: 美国国防部所在地，代指美国军方）表示将对视频中的一位议员——退役海军上尉兼宇航员马克·凯利参议员展开调查之后传出的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">News of the FBI's involvement comes after the Pentagon said it was opening investigation into one of the lawmakers in the video, Senator Mark Kelly, who's a retired Navy captain and astronaut.</p>
</details>

凯利参议员对此回应道：“我不会在这里被噤声。这有压力吗？我曾被比唐纳德·特朗普试图恐吓我闭嘴、不让我履行职责更重要的事情所困扰。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm not going to be silenced here. Is it is it stressful? I've been stressed by, you know, things more important than Donald Trump trying to intimidate me into shutting my mouth and not doing my job.</p>
</details>

凯利在采访中为自己辩护。一些法律专家告诉《纽约时报》，这些调查显然是企图对国会议员进行报复，没有任何法律依据。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Kelly has defended himself in interviews. And some legal experts tell the Times the investigations are a clear attempt to seek vengeance against the members of Congress with no grounding in the law.</p>

### 特朗普政府最新动态

关于特朗普政府，还有三项最新进展。周二，联邦政府宣布了15种不同药物的新低价格，这是**联邦医疗保险**（Medicare: 美国一项为老年人及部分残疾人提供医疗保险的联邦计划）与制药公司谈判的结果。新价格不太可能直接为美国个人节省开支，但预计在2027年生效后，将为政府节省数十亿美元。政府表示，如果这些价格在过去一年实施，联邦医疗保险将节省120亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, three other quick updates on the Trump administration. On Tuesday, the federal government announced new lower prices for 15 different medications, the result of negotiations between Medicare and drug companies. The new prices are unlikely to lead to direct savings for individual Americans, but they are expected to save the government billions of dollars when they take effect in 2027. The administration said if they'd been in place this past year, Medicare would have saved 12 billion.</p>
</details>

政府官员们对这些节省津津乐道，但值得注意的是，促成这些谈判的法律是由拜登总统签署的，而当时没有任何共和党人支持这项措施。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Administration officials have boasted about the savings, though notably the negotiations that led to them were only made possible by a law signed by President Biden, a measure that no Republicans supported at the time.</p>
</details>

此外，在特朗普总统以不同寻常的方式为他的**总统过渡期**（presidential transition: 新旧总统交接期间的行政准备工作）提供资金近一年后，他的团队公布了捐款人的名单。传统上，新任总统会同意披露捐款人姓名并限制捐款金额，以换取联邦政府为其过渡期规划提供资金。特朗普避开了这一做法，称这将节省纳税人的钱。最新公布的名单显示，许多捐款人后来都在他的政府中担任了重要职务。其中包括被任命为教育部长和商务部长的琳达·麦克马洪（Linda McMahon）和霍华德·卢特尼克（Howard Lutnik），特朗普的中东特使史蒂夫·威科夫（Steve Wickoff），以及**司法部**（Justice Department: 美国联邦政府的法律部门）的第三高级官员等。一个促进政府最佳实践的无党派非营利组织负责人告诉《纽约时报》：“他们声称在为纳税人省钱，但他们实际上是在隐瞒谁在收买政府。”特朗普过渡团队的一位发言人驳斥了这一说法，称特朗普不被任何人收买，只做符合国家最佳利益的事情。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Also, nearly a year after President Trump went an unusual route in funding his transition to the White House, his team has released the names of the donors who paid for it. Traditionally, incoming presidents agree to disclose donors' names and put a cap on those donations in exchange for federal funding for their transition planning. Trump sidestepped that, saying it would save taxpayer dollars. The newly released list shows many names of people who went on to get high-profile roles in his administration. There's Linda McMahon and Howard Lutnik, who were appointed secretaries of education and commerce, Steve Wickoff, Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, and others, including the third highest ranking official in the Justice Department. The head of a nonpartisan nonprofit that promotes best practices in government, told the Times, quote, "They claimed they were saving taxpayers money, but what they were doing was hiding the ball about who is buying the government." A spokeswoman for the Trump transition team rejected that claim, saying that Trump is not bought by anyone and does what's in the best interest of the country.</p>

**内政部**（Department of the Interior: 负责管理美国联邦土地和自然资源的部门）宣布，将提高该国最受欢迎国家公园对外国游客的收费。从1月1日起，美国以外的游客在参观优胜美地、黄石公园等标志性景点时，除了标准门票外，还需额外支付100美元的附加费。目前尚不清楚新费用将对**国家公园管理局**（National Park Service: 负责管理美国国家公园的联邦机构）的收入或游客数量产生何种影响。自特朗普上任以来，国家公园一直陷入混乱。它们失去了近四分之一的员工，有时甚至没有足够的人手来完成清洁或收取门票等日常任务。同时，赴美旅游人数显著下降，而国际游客历来为公园带来了数百万的客流。例如，来自加拿大的游客数量已连续第十个月下降。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the Department of the Interior has announced that it's raising prices for foreign tourists at the country's most popular national parks. Starting January 1st, visitors from outside the US will have to pay a $100 sir charge on top of the standard entrance fee to visit Yusede, Yellowstone, and other iconic sites. It's not immediately clear what impact the new fees will have on the revenue for the National Park Service or on the number of visitors. Since Trump took office, the parks have been thrown into turmoil. They've lost nearly a quarter of their staff to the point that sometimes they don't even have enough people to do routine tasks like cleaning or collecting entrance fees. And there's been a significant decline in tourism to the US, which has historically brought millions of international visitors to the parks. Tourism from Canada, for example, has now dropped for the 10th straight month in a row.</p>

### 美国在加沙的住房计划

在中东地区，《纽约时报》获悉，美国官员正迅速推进一项在**加沙**（Gaza: 中东地区的一个地带，位于地中海东岸）建设住房区的计划。一群在美国驻以色列豪华海滨酒店工作的外交官正试图尽快启动一系列项目建设，他们称之为“**替代安全社区**”（alternative safe communities: 美国计划在加沙建设的临时住房区），这些社区将提供临时住所、医疗诊所和学校。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the Middle East, the Times has learned that US officials are rapidly pushing forward with a plan to build housing compounds in Gaza. The group of American diplomats who are working out of luxury beachfront hotels in Israel are trying to start construction as soon as possible on a string of projects they're calling alternative safe communities that would have temporary shelter, medical clinics, and schools.</p>
</details>

这些社区将位于以色列控制的加沙地带一半区域。目标是鼓励巴勒斯坦人搬到新社区，并远离仍由**哈马斯**（Hamas: 巴勒斯坦逊尼派伊斯兰政治军事组织）控制的加沙地区。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The compounds would be located in the half of Gaza that Israel controls. And the goal is that Palestinians would feel encouraged to move to the new communities and be drawn away from the parts of Gaza still under Hamas control.</p>
</details>

第一个社区的建设场地预计将于本周开始清理，尽管可能需要数月才能完成。短期内，该计划可以为数千名在以色列军队摧毁加沙绝大多数建筑物后生活在废墟中的人们提供援助。然而，该计划也受到了部分欧洲外交官、**联合国**（UN: United Nations: 国际组织，旨在促进国际合作与和平）官员、援助人员和巴勒斯坦人的批评，他们指出了各种潜在问题，从谁来支付这些社区的实际担忧，到为何在加沙居民目前居住的地区重建工作受阻等问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The site of the first compound is expected to be cleared for construction starting this week, though it could take months to complete. In the short term, the plan could provide relief for thousands of people who've been living amid the rubble after Israeli troops destroyed the vast majority of buildings in Gaza. But it's drawn criticism from some European diplomats, UN officials, aid workers, and Palestinians who point to a range of potential issues. From practical concerns about who will pay for the compounds to questions about why rebuilding efforts have been blocked in the areas where Gazins currently live.</p>
</details>

加沙当地一位商界领袖告诉《纽约时报》：“加沙人民不是你可以从一个地方搬到另一个地方的家具。他们有情感和依恋。他们希望尽可能靠近他们被毁的家园。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One local business leader in Gaza told the Times, quote, "People in Gaza are not pieces of furniture that you move from one place to another. They have emotions and attachments. They want to be as close as they can to their destroyed homes.</p>

### 感恩节趣闻与传统

最后，关于**感恩节**（Thanksgiving: 北美地区的一个传统节日），人们对这个节日有很多看法，比如什么时候上**火鸡**（turkey），为什么这么多人会在感恩节看橄榄球，电视是开着还是关着，人们应该盛装打扮还是仅仅享受**弹性腰带**（elastic waistband）的生活方式，以及感恩节到底想穿什么？当然是这种弹力裤。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And finally, what is the best time of day to sit down for a holiday meal? That's People have a lot of opinions about Thanksgiving, like when to serve the turkey. Why do so many people watch football on Thanksgiving? Should the TV be on or off? Should people dress up or just embrace the elastic waistband lifestyle? Oh, come on. What do we actually want to wear on Thanksgiving? Pants like this. These are your stretchy pants.</p>
</details>

今年，《纽约时报》采访了许多对这个节日充满热情的人，包括美食作家、食谱制作者等，了解他们最热门的感恩节观点。这里只是其中一小部分，看看你同意哪些，又有哪些可能会让你想掀桌子并砸碎一瓶马提内利（Martinelli's）气泡酒。

<p class="english-text">This year, the Times talked with people very invested in the holiday. Food writers, recipe makers, etc. about their most piping hot Thanksgiving takes. Here is just a taste. See what you agree with and what maybe makes you want to flip a table and smash a bottle of Martinelli's.</p>
</details>

以下是一些观点：每个人都应该戴名牌，即使是家人也一样，因为谁知道那是哪个表亲的女朋友？从零开始烹饪一切都被高估了，拥抱粉末、速溶包和罐头食品吧。每人应该有一个派。或者，持相反的“反派”观点：派根本没那么好吃，甜点应该是奶酪。更具争议的是，你的火鸡可以是**千层面**（lasagna）。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Here we go. Everyone should wear name tags, even family, because which cousin's girlfriend is that? Cooking everything from scratch is overrated. Embrace the powders, packets, and cans. There should be one pie per person. Or the opposite villainous take, pie's just not that good. Dessert should be cheese. And getting really controversial here, your turkey can be a lasagna.</p>
</details>

你可以在nytimes.com找到所有这些观点以及更多内容，并投票选出你同意的。就我个人而言，我认为感恩节的汤不够多。是的，我就是个爱喝汤的人，我承认。

以上就是新闻头条。本节目本周将停播，这意味着没有周五新闻问答。所以，在我们结束之前，我们会给你一个感恩节的脑筋急转弯。问题是：大约四十年来，美国总统每年11月都会象征性地**赦免一到两只火鸡**（presidential turkey pardon: 美国总统在感恩节前赦免火鸡的传统仪式）。这些火鸡通常会被送到农场，但在乔治·W·布什（George W. Bush）执政的几年里，它们被送到了一个度假胜地。这些火鸡去了哪里？答案是：这些火鸡乘坐美国联合航空公司的头等舱飞往迪士尼乐园参加游行。这真是一群比你过得更好的稀有火鸡。祝您胃口好！我们下周一再见。

<p class="english-text">Those are the headlines. The show will be off for the rest of the week. That means no Friday news quiz. So, before we go, we will give you one Thanksgiving stumper. Here's the question. For about four decades, American presidents have ceremoniously offered official pardons to one or two turkeys every November. The birds usually get sent to farms, but for a couple years under George W. Bush, they were sent to a vacation destination. Where did the turkeys go? The answer, the turkeys were flown first class on United Airlines to Disneyland for a parade. Truly the rare turkeys who had a better Thanksgiving than you did. Bona petite. We will be back on Monday.</p>
