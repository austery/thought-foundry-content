### 全球安全格局的演变

北约前秘书长延斯·斯托尔滕贝格（**Jens Stoltenberg**：曾任挪威首相，后担任北大西洋公约组织秘书长）在播客节目《In Good Company》中接受采访时，回顾了他八年前出版的一本书，该书涵盖了直到十年前的时期。主持人询问他，自那本书问世以来，世界发生了哪些最重要的变化。

<p class="english-text">Hi everyone, I'm thrilled to be here with Jens Stoltenberg, who just finished off as the Secretary General in NATO, and before NATO, he was the Prime Minister of Norway. Warm welcome, Jens. Thank you so much for having me. So I'm having here a book which you wrote, which came out eight years ago, which basically covered the period until ten years ago, and it's got a beautiful picture of you on the front here. But just, what are the most important changes in the world since that book came out?</p>

斯托尔滕贝格指出，与他在**北约**（NATO: North Atlantic Treaty Organization，北大西洋公约组织）的职责相关的最重要变化是世界变得更加危险。他认为这是坏消息，而好消息是北约变得更加强大，能够保护近十亿人口。从安全角度来看，欧洲现在正经历一场全面战争，中东地区也爆发了一场新的破坏性冲突，存在升级的风险。此外，大国之间，如美国和中国，全球竞争显著加剧。同时，网络、混合式和恐怖主义威胁也持续存在，对全球安全构成威胁。因此，从根本上说，我们生活在一个更加不可预测、更加危险的世界中。

<p class="english-text">The most important changes, at least related to my task, my responsibilities in NATO, is that the world has become more dangerous. That's the bad news. The good news is that NATO has become stronger to protect close to one billion people. Of course, there are many other changes, but seen from a security perspective, we have now a full-scale war in Europe. We have a new, very devastating conflict in the Middle East, with a risk of escalation, and we have significantly more global rivalry between great powers like the United States and China. And then we have cyber, hybrid, and terrorist threats as a constant threat to our security. So, fundamentally, we live in a more unpredictable, more dangerous world.</p>

### 乌克兰战争的走向与独裁联盟

当被问及乌克兰局势将如何结束时，斯托尔滕贝格强调，战争本质上是极其不可预测的，因此他会非常谨慎地预测其结局。他表示，虽然我们都希望战争结束，但挑战在于，最快结束战争的方式是战败，但这不会带来和平，只会导致乌克兰被占领，使其不再是一个主权、独立、民主的欧洲国家，而是一个受莫斯科控制的国家。他认为，如果希望战争以数百万乌克兰人仍能生活在自由民主社会的方式结束，就需要让**普京总统**（President Putin）相信他无法在战场上取胜，从而迫使他坐下来谈判，达成一个能让乌克兰继续保持主权民主国家的解决方案。

<p class="english-text">And we have done for decades if we cover some of these points here. So, how do you think the Ukraine situation will end? What's the most likely? Wars are by nature extremely unpredictable, so therefore I will be very careful predicting how that will end. But of course, we all want this war to end. The challenge is that the quickest way to end the war is to lose a war, but that will not lead to peace. That will lead to occupation of Ukraine, and Ukraine will not be a sovereign, independent, democratic nation in Europe anymore; it will be a country controlled by Moscow. So if you want the war to end in a way where millions of Ukrainians still can live in a free, democratic society, then we need to convince President Putin that he will not win on the battlefield, that he has to sit down and negotiate, agree on a solution where Ukraine can still be a sovereign, democratic nation.</p>

关于世界上**独裁者**（Autocrats: 实行独裁统治的领导人或政权）之间日益紧密的联系，斯托尔滕贝格认为，这意味着西方世界必须更加团结。他指出，当独裁政权日益结盟时，北约盟国（32个跨大西洋国家）以及其他不愿成为独裁联盟一部分的国家必须站在一起。乌克兰是这方面最明显的例子：俄罗斯是战争侵略的责任方，而朝鲜、伊朗和中国是这场战争的主要武器供应者和支持者。他强调，这不是空谈，而是真实存在并正在战场上产生影响的事实。俄罗斯和中国也在日本周边及世界其他地区进行更多联合演习。这种全球图景使得北约盟国团结一致，并与包括韩国、日本在内的世界各地伙伴合作变得尤为重要。

<p class="english-text">The fact that there are stronger and stronger links between the autocrats in the world, what are the implications for the Western world? That we have to be together when we see that the autocrats are more and more aligned. And then of course, that's partly "we," meaning partly NATO allies, so 32 nations on both sides of the Atlantic, but also with other countries which at least don't want to be part of a kind of autocratic alliance. And again, Ukraine is perhaps the clearest example. Russia is responsible for war aggression. The main providers of weapons and enablers of that war are North Korea, Iran, and China. And this is not rhetoric; this is real and makes a difference on the battlefield. And we also see how Russia and China are exercising more together, also around Japan and other parts of the world. So this is really a global picture that makes it even more important that of course NATO allies stand together, but also that we work with partners all around the world, including South Korea, Japan, and many other countries.</p>

### 欧盟在防务政策中的作用

对于欧盟在防务政策中扮演更重要角色的呼声，斯托尔滕贝格认为，如果以正确的方式进行，那将是非常好的；如果以错误的方式进行，则会非常糟糕。他解释说，正确的方式是**欧盟**（EU: European Union，欧洲联盟）应该做得更多，并且他们已经开始在这方面加大力度，例如加强国防工业——这意味着克服欧洲国防工业的碎片化，增加国防开支，并普遍加强欧洲的防御能力。他强调，这样做也将同时加强北约。

<p class="english-text">There are some voices that want the EU to play a more important part in defense policy. What is your view on that? My view is that if it's done in the right way, it's very good; if it's done in the wrong way, it's very bad. So what's the right way? And the right way is that the EU should do more, and they have started to step up when it comes to, for instance, strengthening the defense industry, meaning overcoming the fragmentation of the European defense industry, to increase defense spending, and to generally strengthen European defenses, meaning that that will also strengthen NATO.</p>

### 太空武器化与人工智能对战争的影响

关于**太空武器化**（Weaponization of space: 将太空用于军事目的，部署或使用太空武器）以及其对战争的影响，斯托尔滕贝格指出，太空正日益被武器化，并且太空中的事件对地球上的活动越来越重要，这在通信、**GPS**（Global Positioning System: 全球定位系统）、**网络战**（Cyber warfare: 利用网络和信息系统进行攻击或防御的战争形式）以及目标定位方面显而易见。乌克兰的许多军事行动都依赖于太空中的卫星，未来的任何冲突中，太空都将扮演重要角色。他还提到，俄罗斯和中国正在开发可作为进攻性武器的能力，这是一个危险的发展。

<p class="english-text">What's going on in space from a warfare point of view? So first, I think what we see is that there is more and more weaponization of space, and what happens in space matters more and more for what's going on on the Earth. That's obvious for communications, GPS, cyber, and then of course, targeting. A lot of military operations in Ukraine are dependent on satellites in space, and in any future conflict, space will be important. What we also then see is that again, Russia and China are developing capabilities that can actually be used as offensive weapons, and this is a dangerous development.</p>
</details>

谈到**人工智能**（AI: Artificial Intelligence，人工智能）对战争的影响，斯托尔滕贝格认为，人工智能已经并将进一步从根本上改变战争的性质，其影响可能与工业革命一样深远。他表示，我们现在正经历一个根本性的转变，尽管我们尚未完全理解其全部含义，但**自主系统**（Autonomous systems: 无需人类持续干预即可运行的系统）、**面部识别**（Facial recognition: 通过分析面部特征识别个人身份的技术）、**无人机**（Drones: 无人驾驶飞行器）以及利用人工智能进行**网络攻击**（Cyber attacks: 针对计算机系统、网络或数据的恶意行为）等技术，有潜力极大地改变战争，以至于我们很难完全理解其全部影响。他指出，在乌克兰战场上已经看到了这些变化，北约使用的一些无人机和监视系统也利用人工智能处理信息。这仅仅是战争性质根本性变化的开始。

<p class="english-text">In a way, a bit related to that, AI, what are the issues surrounding that when it comes to warfare? Some people in America say that we should build AI into everything we do, into all the weapons, all the cars, everything, to beat the Chinese in this kind of fight. How do you see AI impacting warfare? I think what is obvious is that AI has, and will even more so in the future, change the nature of warfare, perhaps as fundamentally as the Industrial Revolution did. I think we see something similar now, a fundamental shift where we don't fully understand, but autonomous systems, facial recognition, drones, cyber attacks by using also AI, have the potential of changing warfare so much that it's very hard to fully understand the full implications. We have already seen it on the battlefield in Ukraine. It's not a secret that some of the drones and the surveillance systems that NATO operates also use AI to process information. So this has already started, but we have only seen the beginning of a fundamental change of the nature of warfare.</p>

### 危机中的领导力与共识建立

回顾他在挪威首相任内应对“7月袭击”恐怖事件以及在北约处理乌克兰局势的经历，斯托尔滕贝格被问及在这些创伤性情境中如何领导。他认为关键在于保持冷静，并确保充足睡眠，因为能够正常运作至关重要。他曾看到一些人在危机中过早地耗尽自己。至于如何处理个人情绪，他坦言自己有些特别，在危机最严重时会压抑情绪，将其暂时搁置，他认为这在某种程度上对他有所帮助。他承认领导是孤独的，但也许没有人们想象的那么孤独，因为他擅长允许他人提供帮助。

<p class="english-text">You ran this country during the July attack, the terror attacks that we had, and through the Ukraine situation in NATO. How does one lead during these traumatic situations? What's the key? It's to remain calm in a way, and to make sure that you sleep, because it is important to be able to function. So I've seen some people in crisis exhausting themselves too early. How do you work with feelings? I'm a bit strange there because when the crises are acute, I suppress them. I just keep them away, and in one way, I think that helps me dealing with feelings. Is it lonely? It is lonely, but perhaps less lonely than people believe. If there's anything I'm quite good at, it is to allow people to help me.</p>

谈及在北约如何与那些被认为有“强大自我”的领导人打交道并达成共识，斯托尔滕贝格认为关键在于认真对待他们的关切。即使在许多问题上存在分歧，他们也可能提出相关的观点和担忧。他举例说，在如何应对**唐纳德·特朗普总统**（Donald Trump: 美国前总统）在白宫的四年任期上，外界曾给予很多关注。他坦言，他与特朗普在贸易、堕胎或气候变化等问题上存在分歧，但这些并非北约的核心议题。因此，他专注于对北约至关重要的问题，而事实上，在这些问题上他们有很大程度的共识。特朗普的主要信息是欧洲盟友必须增加国防投资，尽管他传达信息的方式可能与其他政治领导人有所不同，但其核心信息与**奥巴马总统**（Barack Obama: 美国前总统）在他之前所做的，以及**拜登总统**（Joe Biden: 美国现任总统）现在所做的完全相同。斯托尔滕贝格认真对待了这一关切，并认为这有所帮助。同样，在与**埃尔多安总统**（Recep Tayyip Erdoğan: 土耳其总统）打交道时，人们也曾问他是如何做到的。斯托尔滕贝格表示，埃尔多安曾对土耳其遭受的恐怖袭击比任何其他北约盟国都多这一事实表达了严重关切，因此他认真对待了这一点。他总结道，专注于核心议题是处理与强势政治领导人关系的最佳方式。

<p class="english-text">Talking about people, just how you at NATO have been dealing with people who are perceived to have large egos. What's the key to reaching consensus with them and getting to agreement? I think it's about taking their concerns seriously, and even if we disagree on many issues, they may actually also have relevant points and concerns. Without being too specific, of course, there has been a lot of attention on how we managed four years of President Trump in the White House. And it's no secret that I disagree with him on trade, or abortion, or climate change, but that was not core issues for NATO. So what I focused on was what matters for NATO, and actually on those issues, we had a large degree of agreement. His main message was that European allies had to invest more in defense. He conveyed that message in a way which was a bit different than many other political leaders, but the core of that message was absolutely the same as President Obama had done before him, or President Biden does now. And I took that concern seriously, and I think that helped. The same with President Erdoğan. People asked me how that works. Well, he has expressed serious concerns about the fact that no other NATO country has suffered more terrorist attacks than Turkey. So take that seriously. So I think focusing on the issues, that's the best way of addressing strong political leaders.</p>
