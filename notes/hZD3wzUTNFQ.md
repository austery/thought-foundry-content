### 灾后重建与临时住所

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: 这是关于**洛杉矶山火**三部分系列报道的第三集，探讨一年后的余波与恢复过程。我们建议你按顺序收听。如果你还没听过第一和第二部分，可以在我们的节目列表中找到，标题为《洛杉矶山火恢复的真实代价》。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: This is the third episode in a three-part series about the LA wildfires, a look at the aftermath and the process of recovery one year later. We recommend you listen to this series in order. So, if you haven't heard parts one and two yet, you can find them in our feed labeled the true cost of recovering from the LA wildfires.

</details>

**Mike Cohen**: 伍德伯里（Woodbury）是我们这里的一条东西向街道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Cohen**: So Woodbury is one of our east west running streets here.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: 那是 **Mike Cohen**，我的同事，也是 **Wirecutter** 的交易撰稿人。他在去年一月的洛杉矶山火中失去了家园。2025 年 12 月，他正带着我、我们的执行制片人兼联合主持人 **Rosie Garin** 以及制片人 **Abigail Keel** 在**阿尔塔迪纳**（Altadena）参观。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: That's Mike Cohen again, my colleague and deals writer for Wirecutter. He lost his home last January in the LA wildfires. He's showing me, our executive producer and co-host Rosie Garin, and producer Abigail Keel around Altadena in December 2025.

</details>

**Mike Cohen**: 左边是我们以前设立恢复中心的地方，就像灾难救援中心。**FEMA**（联邦紧急事务管理局）、陆军工兵部队，所有人都在一个大帐篷里办公。左边这里是核心区域，他们在那向我们展示各种不同的 **ADU**（附属居住单元）和可以购买的模块化房屋。他们试图帮助人们承担重建费用，买一个 ADU 放在地块上，然后在房子重建期间住在里面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Cohen**: And to the left there's where we had the recovery center, like the disaster relief center. That's where FEMA, Army Corps, everybody set up in a big tent. On the left, this is core. That's where they're showing us a bunch of different ADUs and different modular homes that you can purchase. trying to help people with the cost of rebuilding to buy an ADU, plop it on their plot, and then live in it while their house is being rebuilt.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Mike 刚才提到的 ADU，代表附属居住单元。它们看起来有点像微型住宅。ADU 在洛杉矶很常见，人们通常把它们用作办公室或客房。对于像 Mike 这样失去家园的人来说，使用保险金购买 ADU 是一个选择。他们可以把一个放在土地上，边住边重建。那些这样做的人，会不会担心土壤中残留的**毒性**随风飘散并被吸入？在一切修复之前，回到自己的土地上居住是否是一种风险？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: What Mike just mentioned there, the ADUs, that stands for accessory dwelling units. They kind of look like tiny homes. ADUs are pretty common in LA. People use them as offices or guest rooms. Using insurance money to buy an ADU is an option for people who've lost their homes like Mike. They can put one on their land to live in while they rebuild. Are the people that are doing that are they at all concerned about the sort of remaining toxicity in the soil blowing around and breathing that in? Is that something that is kind of a risk you're taking if you come back and live on your property while you're rebuilding before everything has been remediated?

</details>

**Mike Cohen**: 是的，这确实是很多人的担忧，甚至包括那些房子还屹立不倒的人。回到这一地区居住的人们都在向所有人提出这个疑问：“我只能负担得起在阿尔塔迪纳以外的地方住几个月（靠额外生活费补贴），但如果接下来的几年我都要回阿尔塔迪纳住在拖车里，我到底生活在什么样的环境下？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Cohen**: Yeah, that's been a real concern for a lot of the people, even people whose homes are still standing. People who have come back to live in the area are raising that concern with everyone of well, I I I can only afford to live outside of Altadena for so many months with additional living expenses, but if I'm coming back to Altadena for the next couple of years, living in a trailer, what am I living through?

</details>

### 保险缺口与财务困境

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Mike 和他的家人一直住在距离阿尔塔迪纳约 20 分钟车程的租来公寓里。他们仍在考虑下一步该怎么办：是尝试重建，还是卖掉土地搬走。这是一个艰难的决定，尤其是因为 Mike 哪种选择都负担不起。他做决定的时间已经不多了。保险公司支付租金的补助快用完了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Mike and his family have been living in a rental apartment about 20 minutes away from Altadena. They're still figuring out what to do next. Attempt to rebuild or try to sell and move on. It's a tough decision, especially because Mike can't really afford either option. And his time to make a decision is running out. The help he's getting from insurance to pay for his rental won't last much longer.

</details>

**Mike Cohen**: 我们的**额外生活费**（ALE）只剩下几个月了，而且我们的房贷延期偿付期（在此期间我们不必每月还款）也将在下个月到期。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Cohen**: Our additional living expenses are only for a couple more months and a moratorium on our mortgage whereby we didn't have to pay each month is also going to expire next month.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: 所以你很快就会面临这样一个节点：你既需要付房租住在某个地方，又需要为你那被烧毁的房子偿还抵押贷款。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: So you're going to reach a point soon where you're going to be needing to pay rent to live somewhere and you're going to need to pay the mortgage on your home that burned down.

</details>

**Mike Cohen**: 是的。我不知道我们能怎么办。这将取决于财务状况，而我们的时间正在耗尽。我认为这是大多数阿尔塔迪纳人所面临的困境。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Cohen**: Yeah. I don't know what we're going to be able to do. It's going to be up to the finances and the amount of time that we have is running out. And I think that that's the predicament that most people in Altadena find themselves in.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: 我是 Christine Cyr Clisset，这是《Wirecutter Show》。当我们着手制作这个系列时，我们非常想关注 Mike 和我们的同事 **Gregory Han** 在洛杉矶山火恢复一年后学到的教训。尘埃落定后，有哪些事情让他们记忆深刻？他们希望有人早点告诉他们哪些建议？

在第一集中，我们了解了 Mike 和 Gregory 在火灾中失去了什么，以及在紧要关头社区的帮助是多么关键。上一集，他们分享了灾前可以做的一些准备工作，比如记录你的财产，确保你了解房主或租房者保险的承保范围。今天，我们将花时间讨论恢复的**真实代价**——金钱、时间，以及灾后重振旗鼓所带来的情感消耗。我们将深入探讨如何确保拥有足够的保险，以及保险永远无法覆盖的内容。

我们还将听到 Mike 和 Gregory 如何学会为自己维权，以及为什么如果你遇到灾难，可能也需要做好同样的准备。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: I'm Christine Sirloette and this is the Wire Cutter Show. When we set out to make this series, we really wanted to focus on the lessons that Mike and our colleague Gregory Han had learned a year into recovering from the LA wildfires. What were the things that stuck out to them once the dust had settled? What are the pieces of advice they wish someone had given them? In the first episode, we learned what Mike and Gregory each lost in the fires and how crucial their communities were in providing them help and support in the immediate aftermath. Last episode, they shared advice for some of the pre-work you can do ahead of time that could help in the wake of a natural disaster. Things like documenting your possessions now and making sure you understand what's covered by your homeowners or renters's policy. Today, we're going to spend some time talking about the true cost of recovery, the money, the time, and the emotional toll that finding your feet after a natural disaster can take. We'll expand on how to make sure you have enough insurance and also what insurance could never cover. We're also going to hear about some of the ways Mike and Gregory have learned to advocate for themselves and why if you're ever in a disaster, you might need to be prepared to do the same.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: 如果你要给两年前的自己写一封关于保险的信，你会说什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: If you were to write yourself a letter today from 2 years ago about insurance, what would be the main things that you would say to yourself?

</details>

**Mike Cohen**: 多买点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Cohen**: Get more.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: 是的。当我与 Gregory 和 Mike 交谈时，他们都告诉我，在过去的一年里，他们产生了一些可能永远无法由保险覆盖的费用。比如更换物品的费用、损失的工资，对 Gregory 来说，还有房屋维修和升级的费用。但对 Mike 来说，**伊顿火灾**（Eaton Fire）后的财务后果是惊人的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Yeah. When I talked to Gregory and Mike, they both told me that over the last year, they had incurred costs that may never be covered by insurance. costs like replacing items, lost wages, and for Gregory, covering repairs and upgrades to his home. For Mike though, the financial aftermath of the eaten fire is staggering.

</details>

**Mike Cohen**: 就像大多数美国人一样，我们有保险，但**保险不足**（underinsured）。在我们的案例中，我们买房时付了大约 10% 的首付来获得贷款。保险只覆盖实际的建筑结构，不覆盖土地，因为他们假设你可以把地卖掉。所以，当你查看保额时，很多人会说，确保它至少是房屋总买价的一半，甚至更多。而我们的保额还不到一半。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Cohen**: So, like most Americans, we are insured, but we are underinsured. In our scenario, we bought our home, we put about 10% down in order to get our mortgage. the insurance only covers the actual structure, doesn't cover the piece of land because they presume that you can sell that. So, when you're looking at that coverage, a lot of people would say make sure that it's at least half, if not more, of the total purchase price of your home. We got a little less than half.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: 房屋保险的额度并不总是那么简单。它取决于许多因素，但理想情况下，它应该覆盖重建房屋和土地上任何建筑的成本。这可能不是你购买房产的价格，也不是它目前的市场价值。由于建筑成本往往随时间上涨，它可能比你目前的保额要高。许多美国人没有足够的房屋保险。

估算显示，全国多达三分之二的房主保险不足，就像 Mike 一样。这意味着如果他们的房子今天被毁，保单中的保额将无法支付重建房屋的全部费用。Mike 获得的“全损”赔偿额与潜在建筑商向他报出的原址重建价格并不匹配。而这正是许多阿尔塔迪纳和帕利塞德斯（Palisades）居民现在的处境。

根据**保险信息协会**（Insurance Information Institute）的数据，由于**供应链中断**、建筑材料价格上涨和劳动力短缺等因素，过去 5 年全国的重建成本上涨了近 30%。而在像洛杉矶山火这样的自然灾害之后，这些成本往往会进一步攀升，因为有太多人需要同时重建。对于 Mike 来说，保险赔偿与重建成本之间的差距高达数十万美元，而且他仍然需要为那座被烧毁的房子支付抵押贷款。

Mike 的另一个选择是拿走保险赔偿并卖掉土地。但我不认为在被烧毁、被淹没或发生泥石流的地区，那块地能值那么多钱来弥补这个差额。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: The amount of coverage you should have on your home isn't always straightforward. It will depend on a number of factors, but ideally it should cover the cost to rebuild your house and any structures on your land. And that may not be the price you paid for your property or its current market value. And because building costs tend to go up over time, it might be more than you're currently insured for. Many Americans do not have enough home insurance. Estimates show that as high as almost two out of three homeowners across the country are underinsured, just like Mike. This means that if their home was destroyed today, the amount of coverage in their policy would not cover the full cost of rebuilding their home. Mike's coverage for a total loss, the situation he's in, does not match what prospective builders are quoting him to rebuild on the same lot. And this situation is what many people in Altadena and the Palisades now find themselves in. According to the Insurance Information Institute, the cost of rebuilding nationwide has gone up by nearly 30% over the past 5 years because of things like supply chain disruptions, rising building material costs, and labor shortages. And in the wake of a natural disaster like the LA wildfires, those costs tend to rise even further because so many people need to rebuild at the same time. For Mike, the difference in what he can get from insurance and what it would cost to rebuild is hundreds of thousands of dollars, and he still has to pay his mortgage for the home that burned down. Mike's other option is to take the insurance payout and sell the land. I don't think that plot of land in a burned down or flooded out or mudslid area is going to be worth that amount to cover the difference.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Mike 所处的这种困境被称为“**保险缺口**”（insurance gap）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: This spot Mike finds himself in, it's called the insurance gap.

</details>

**Mike Cohen**: 现在，我们就卡在这个缺口里。如果我们拿走保险金，尽力偿还抵押贷款并卖掉地块，我们仍然损失了大约四分之一的投资。所以我们必须重建，但我们还负担不起——至少建不起原来的那种房子，也建不起那种能按原始买价卖掉的房子。所以我们被困住了。

无论你住在哪里，无论你是买房还是租房，无论你面临什么风险，现在每个人都应该考虑做的一件事就是：**每年**与你的保险代理人核对，确保你有足够的保额。这听起来可能很麻烦或很贵，但每月可能并不会多花多少钱，如果你真的遇到全损的情况，它最终可能会在财务上救你一命。如果你对房屋进行了装修或升级，增加了其价值，你也应该确保拥有正确的保额。

停下来问自己一个问题：如果发生损失，你负担得起重建费用吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Cohen**: Right now, we're stuck in that gap. If we take the insurance money and try to pay off as much of our mortgage and sell our plot, we're still down about uh quarter of our investment. So then we have to rebuild, but we can't afford to yet. Um not to the house that we had and not really to a house that we could sell for the original purchase price either. So we're stuck. One thing that anyone should consider doing right now, no matter where you live, whether you own a rent or what risks you face, is to check in with your insurance agent annually to make sure you have enough coverage. This may sound like a hassle or expensive, but it might not cost that much more per month, and it could end up saving you financially if you ever are in a total loss situation. And if you've remodeled or upgraded your home in other ways that increase its value, you should also make sure you have the right amount of coverage. Stop and ask yourself a question. Could you afford to rebuild after a loss?

</details>

### 心理创伤与幸存者愧疚

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: 保险缺口只是灾后财务成本的一个例子。但恢复的真实代价远不止财务。我的同事 Gregory Han 说，对他来说，这还包括对**自我意识**的重新审视。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: The insurance gap is one example of a financial cost in the aftermath of a disaster. But the true cost of recovery includes much more than finances. My colleague Gregory Han says that for him it included reckoning with a new sense of self.

</details>

**Gregory Han**: 我醒来时不知道自己在哪里，不知道今天是哪一天，有时甚至不知道我是谁。那是一种非常奇怪的感觉。我觉得定义我的那些边缘已经变得模糊，我仍在努力寻找立足点。我的生活中也共鸣着一种**幸存者愧疚感**（survivor's guilt）。有时在家里度过美好时光会感觉很奇怪，因为我知道就在街道尽头，有人正盯着他们以前放沙发的地方，他们以前曾在那拥抱孩子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregory Han**: I wake up and I don't know where I am, what the day is, and sometimes who I am. That's a real weird sensation. The edges of what I think defines me have been softened in a way that I'm still trying to get a foothold. There's a survivor's guilt that resonates through my life, too. It feels weird sometimes having having good moments at home when I know just down the street somebody's like looking at where their couch used to be. They used to cuddle up with their kids.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: 悲伤，以及这种悲伤如何干扰了他的正常状态和生产力，也让 Gregory 感到惊讶。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: And the grief and how much that grief interrupted his normal state of being and productivity has also surprised Gregory.

</details>

**Gregory Han**: 在流离失所期间我没怎么工作，因为我的全职工作就是处理一切事务，努力让我们回家，同时还要照顾我的妻子。现在很难回到那种认为“那些事情很重要”的心态。我是说，是的，我必须谋生，但当你逃离了那样的动荡和可能的死亡后，真的很难再去关心那些事。有些事似乎不再那么重要了。但是，你知道，我们都在努力挺过去。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregory Han**: I didn't work that much while I was displaced because my full-time job was navigating everything to try to get us back home and then also being a caretaker to my wife. And it's been really hard to get back into this mind state like that those things are that important like the the work is important, you know? I mean, yeah, I have to make a living, but it's really hard to care about those things when you've escaped such instability and possible death. Some things just don't seem that important anymore. But, you know, we're all just trying to get by.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Gregory 是一名自由撰稿人。他不是 Wirecutter 或任何地方的全职员工。他的妻子 Emily 也是如此。他们一直能维持下去，但现在 Gregory 感受到了不稳定的压力。我们上次谈到了他在火灾后维修房屋所产生的费用。你是如何承担这些费用的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Gregory is a freelance writer. He's not employed full-time by Wire Cutter or anywhere else. And it's the same for his wife Emily. They've been able to make it work, but now Gregory is feeling the weight of instability. We talked last time about the cost he incurred in the aftermath of the fire repairing his home. How are you covering those costs?

</details>

**Gregory Han**: 我们在动用储蓄。在一切变糟之前，我和妻子做得还不错，我们开始为不时之需和退休存钱。而那个“不时之需”以火灾的形式到来了。坦白说，我现在感到完全不稳定，非常害怕我的晚年生活会是什么样子。因为现在我们处于这样一种境地：我们要担心财产税，担心房屋保险，而在一个气候不稳定、房子可能再次着火的环境中，我们该如何负担得起这些？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregory Han**: We are dipping into savings. So my wife and I before everything went pear-shaped, we were doing well and we started saving for a rainy day and also for retirement. And that rainy day came in the form of fire. Um, now I'm feeling completely unstable and feeling really to be frank, very frightened about what my senior years are going to be like because now we're in a situation like, okay, now we have to worry about property tax. Now we have to worry about the home insurance and how are we going to afford that in a climate unstable landscape of possible home catching on fire again.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: 未来再次发生灾难的可能性笼罩着 Gregory 和 Mike 的决定。在阿尔塔迪纳重建、继续留在这里是个好主意吗？这些都是难以回答的问题。但至少目前，他们两人都觉得阿尔塔迪纳就是家。

尽管如此，Gregory 仍然担心缺乏财务安全网，尤其是现在他已经动用了储蓄。这是他过去一年最大的感悟之一：如果你能存钱，无论多少都要存，因为也许它能支付疏散时的酒店费用，或者支付你担心的污染物检测费用。另一方面，Mike 对于“应急基金对大多数人来说是否足够”的想法感到有些复杂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: The possibility of a future disaster looms over Gregory and Mike in their decisions. Is it a good idea to rebuild in Altadena to stay here at all? They're tough questions to answer. But at least for now, both of them feel like Altadena is home. Still though, Gregory is worried about his lack of a financial safety net, especially now that he's dipped into his savings. That's one of his major takeaways from the last year. If you can save money, any amount you can, because maybe it'll help cover the cost of a hotel room in an evacuation or pay out of pocket to test for contamination you're worried about. Mike, on the other hand, feels a little complicated about the idea of an emergency fund being enough for most people.

</details>

**Mike Cohen**: 没有任何数额的应急基金能成为我们所寻找的那种安全网。那是保险的作用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Cohen**: There is no proper amount of a rainy day fund that would be the safety net that we were looking for. That's what insurance is for.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Mike 说，这个缺口无法通过存下几个月的开销来弥补。他认识一些人通过 **GoFundMe** 发起筹款来弥补缺口，或者向**小企业管理局**（SBA）贷款，这是一个在灾区提供低息贷款的联邦机构。Mike 也可以申请额外的贷款来弥补缺口，但这会增加每月的总支出，而在支付房租和未结清的抵押贷款之间，这已经变得让人难以承受。Mike 的建议回到了他上一集谈到的内容：了解你的保险单并确保保额充足是至关重要的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: The gap, Mike says, can't be closed with a few months worth of expenses saved. He knows people who have started GoFundMes to help close that gap or taken out loans with the Small Business Administration or SBA, a federal organization that offers lowterest loans in disaster areas. Mike could take out an additional loan to help close his gap, but this would add to overall monthly costs that are already becoming overwhelming between paying rent and his outstanding mortgage. Mike's recommendation goes back to what he talked about last episode. That knowing your insurance policy and making sure it's enough is crucial.

</details>

**Mike Cohen**: 我们能做的最好的事情就是，不幸地增加你的保费，看看它们是否能成为那个“应急基金”。你总能设法负担每月额外的 42 美元，但你无法负担因为为了省那 42 美元而导致保险无法覆盖的六位数的损毁和重建成本。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Cohen**: The best thing that we can do is unfortunately increase your premium and see if they can be that rainy day fund. You can afford the extra $42 a month somehow. You can't afford the six figures of destruction and rebuild costs that insurance won't cover because you saved $42 a month.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: 还有另一个弥补缺口的选择是部分幸存者寄予厚望的：**诉讼**。电力公司**南加州爱迪生**（SCE）目前正被联邦政府、洛杉矶县以及其他城市和个人受害者起诉，指控其在火灾起点的伊顿峡谷维护设备不力。SCE 尚未承认对引发火灾负有责任。他们正在向符合条件的受害者提供一项自愿补偿计划。这项补偿可能比诉讼结果快得多，而诉讼可能至少一年内都不会开庭。但等待诉讼结果可能意味着受害者能获得更高的赔付。

并非每场自然灾害都会伴随诉讼或有人可以归咎。伊顿火灾可能有，但即便如此，等待的过程也是恢复的真实代价的一部分。处理保险流程比 Mike 或 Gregory 一年前想象的要复杂和艰巨得多。过去的 12 个月对他们来说是一个陡峭的学习曲线。这并不容易。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: There is one other option for covering the gap that some survivors are hopeful for. A lawsuit. The power company Southern California Edison orCE is currently being sued by the federal government, Los Angeles County, as well as other cities and individual victims for negligence in maintaining its equipment in Eaton Canyon where the fire started. SCE has not admitted it was responsible for starting the fire. They are offering a voluntary compensation program to qualifying victims. Compensation that could come much sooner than the results of the lawsuit, which may not go to court for at least another year. But waiting for the outcome of that lawsuit could mean higher payouts for victims. Not every natural disaster will have an accompanying lawsuit or someone to blame. The eaten fire could, but even so, the waiting game is part of the true cost of recovery. Navigating the insurance process has been more complicated and arduous than Mike or Gregory would have ever imagined a year ago. Their last 12 months have been a steep learning curve. It hasn't been easy.

</details>

### 成为自己的维权者

**Mike Cohen**: 这是一场奥运级别的马拉松。这意味着一些小事，比如汽车完全报废了，被烧成了灰。我的汽车保险赔付说：“哦，我们认为你的车值这么多钱。”现在我必须回去查 **Kelly Blue Book**，我必须去 **CarGurus** 和其他地方找价格，这样我才能说：“不，我认为它值这么多钱。”所以，不幸的是，你必须成为自己的**维权者**（advocate）来保护自己的利益。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Cohen**: It is an Olympic level marathon and it means little things like the car is completely totaled. It's been burned. It's a crisp. My insurance payout for my car insurance says, "Oh, this is how much we think your car is worth." Now I have to go back and look up Kelly Blue Book and I have to go around and find through car gurus and other things other prices so that I can say, "No, I think this is how much it's worth." So, unfortunately, you have to be your own advocate to protect your own interests.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: 准备好成为自己的维权者。这是 Mike 和 Gregory 从这一年中得到的最后一条重要建议。我们将在休息后详细讨论这意味着什么。

Gregory 和 Mike 都一遍又一遍地告诉我，火灾后处理事务的工作量有多大。两人很快就学会了，他们必须为了每一件事与保险公司谈判。不仅如此，他们还必须反复询问同样的问题，重复同样的索赔。有时这些谈判是协作和支持性的，有时则是令人沮丧和对抗性的。Gregory 和 Mike 称之为另一份“全职工作”。一份令人筋疲力尽、情绪耗竭的全职工作，这不是他们中任何一个人想做的，但他们说，如果你发现自己处于他们的境地，就应该做好准备。

我应该提到，有一些服务和组织可以成为你灾后的个案经理。但这些服务并不总是免费的。所以如果你自己承担这份工作，他们有一些建议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Be prepared to be your own advocate. That's the last big piece of advice that Mike and Gregory have taken away from this year. We'll talk more about that and what it means after the break. Gregory and Mike both told me over and over again how much work it was to manage their affairs after the fire. Both quickly learned that they had to negotiate with their insurance companies for everything. And not just that, they had to ask the same questions and make the same claims repeatedly. Sometimes those negotiations were collaborative and supportive. Other times they were frustrating and adversarial. Gregory and Mike called it another full-time job. An exhausting, emotionally draining full-time job, and it's not a job either of them wanted to do, but it's one they say you should be prepared for if you find yourself in a position like theirs. I should mention there are services and organizations out there that can become basically your case manager after a disaster. But these services aren't always free. So if you take the job on yourself, they have a few suggestions.

</details>

**Mike Cohen**: 我们学到的第一件事就是：**不要接受他们的第一次报价**。无论是汽车、租金、与抵押贷款公司的谈判，还是他们扣留我们的保险金，都是如此。所有这些环节，并不是说这些人是为你服务的。你虽然与他们有合同，但他们是为了保护自己的利益。好吗？所以，不要接受第一次报价。将这些与保险公司和其他机构的互动视为它们本来的样子：谈判。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Cohen**: One of the first things we learned was don't take their first offer. That was as true for the car as it is for our AL, our rent, negotiations with our mortgage, and them holding our insurance money. All of these things are parts where it's not like these people are services that work for you. You are contracted with them, but they're there to protect their own interests. Okay? So, don't take the first offer. Consider these interactions with insurance and other agencies as what they are, negotiations.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Gregory 说，抛开任何羞怯、尴尬或羞耻感会有所帮助。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Gregory says that it can help to let go of any timidity, embarrassment or shame.

</details>

**Gregory Han**: 在很多方面我其实是个内向的人，但涉及到家园时，我变成了一个外向的人。我变得非常强势——不是不友善或粗鲁，但我会说：“我正在经历这个过程，我会竭尽全力确保我的妻子回到一个安全的家。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregory Han**: I'm pretty much an introvert in many ways, but when it came to the home, I became an extrovert. I became very forceful of like not unkind or, you know, rude or anything, but I was like, I'm going through this process and I will fight you tooth and nail to make sure that my wife returns to a safe home.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: 这个过程真的激发了 Gregory 强势的一面。强势但不刻薄，这是一个重要的区别。如果你发现自己处于这种境地，考虑到与你谈判的人保持良好关系可能是最好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: This process really brought out that forceful side of Gregory. Forceful but not mean. That's an important distinction. If you ever find yourself in this type of situation, consider that it might be best to stay on good terms with the folks you're negotiating with.

</details>

**Mike Cohen**: 保险理赔员也是人。实际上，我们与保险理赔员相处得非常好，她甚至是第一批知道我们怀孕消息的人之一。她会一直关注：“哦，你们现在进入孕中期了。我知道那是什么感觉。有空再回我。”这些人本身是好人。只是系统和他们所处的职位会让我们变得对立。我总是尝试以同情心、疑点利益归于对方的态度，在人与人的层面上与他们接触。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Cohen**: Insurance adjusters are people, too. We've actually had an amazing time with our insurance adjuster, and she actually became one of the very first people that we shared our pregnancy status with. And she kept track of, "Oh, you guys are in your second trimester now. I know how that is. Get back to me when you can." like these people are good people enough. It's just the systems and the positions that they put us in can become adversarial. I always try to lead with compassion, the benefit of the doubt, and reaching out to them on a humanto human level.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: 人与人也意味着只要有可能，尽量**面对面**交流。Gregory 告诉我，他亲自参加的会议往往比通过电话或电子邮件进行的更顺利，结果也更好。这并不总是一个选项，但如果可以，就当面谈。这听起来很累。听起来像你说的，这像是一场马拉松。保持组织有序和完成任务似乎需要巨大的执行功能。你是如何应对的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Human to human also means whenever possible, try to meet face to face. Gregory told me that the meetings he had in person as opposed to over the phone or via email often went smoother and resulted in better outcomes. It's not always an option, but when it is, do it in person. It sounds exhausting. It sounds like you said it's like a marathon. It sounds like it takes an immense amount of executive function to stay organized and on task. How do you tackle that?

</details>

**Gregory Han**: 最初的几个月，我妻子感到不知所措，我说：“让我们把这件事按天拆解，我们每天只完成一件事。无论这件事是否推动了进度，至少我们做出了努力。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregory Han**: The first several months we my wife felt overwhelmed and I said let's just break this up dayto day and we'll complete one thing every day and one thing we complete whether it moves us forward or not at least we made an effort.

</details>

**Mike Cohen**: 我很幸运，我的工作时间是周日到周四。所以我的周末是周五和周六。这给我留出了一个所有行政办公室都开门的办公日。所以周五对我来说是“**FEMA 周五**”。我早上给 FEMA 打电话，可能会被挂机几个小时。在这几个小时里，我也可以给 SBA 打电话，或者给我的抵押贷款公司写邮件。我要跟进我发送的每一封邮件或通过 SBA 网站发送的门户消息，并每 2 到 3 天跟进一次。我还要走在抵押贷款公司的前面，因为我必须每个月向他们报到，证明我的房子仍然被毁，我没有住在里面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Cohen**: I'm lucky that my employment is Sunday through Thursday. So my weekend is Friday Saturday. That gives me one business day where all of the administrative offices are open. So Friday is FEMA Fridays for me. I call FEMA in the morning. I'm probably on hold for a number of hours. So during those hours, I can also call the SBA or I can be drafting an email to my mortgage company. It's staying on top of every email that I send or portal message through the Small Business Administration's website and following up every 2 to 3 days. It's staying ahead of my mortgage company because I have to check in with them every month proving that my house is still destroyed and I'm not living in it.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Mike 和 Gregory 还建议做详细的笔记。Gregory 记录了一份联系人及联系时间的电子表格。他截取了与保险公司门户消息的屏幕截图。Mike 尽可能录下电话交谈，以便以后回顾。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Mike and Gregory also recommended keeping extensive notes. Gregory has kept a spreadsheet of whom he's contacted and when. He took screenshots of portal messages with insurance. Mike recorded phone conversations when he could to go back to and listen to later.

</details>

**Mike Cohen**: 我们回听了很多次对话，以便确认：“哦，他们说我们可以申请重建。”不，不，他们说的是再融资。不，等等，让我们再听一遍。哦，实际上既是重建也是再融资。记得询问录音许可，不同州有不同的录音规则。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Cohen**: So, we've gone back and relisted to number of conversations in order to say, "Oh, they said that we can apply for rebuilding." No, no, they said refinancing. No, wait. Let's go back. Oh, it's actually both rebuilding and refinancing. Make sure you ask permission to record phone calls. Different states have different rules about recording.

</details>

**Gregory Han**: 是的。我们经常在挂断保险理赔员的电话时说：“你能发一封书面邮件总结一下我们所做的一切吗？”或者我会直接说：“嘿，我可以录音吗？”然后我会让 **AI** 给我们发送一份我们讨论过的一切的邮件摘要，你可以同意或不同意，但我只是想确保我们双方看到的都是黑纸白字的事实。终于，AI 有了一个伟大的用武之地。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregory Han**: Yeah. Something we do is often when we get off the phone with our like insurance adjuster, we'll say, "Can you send us an email in writing summarizing everything we've done?" Or I'll just say, "Hey, is it okay if I record this?" And I'll have AI send us an email summary of everything we've discussed and you can agree or disagree with it, but I just want to make sure that we're both looking at the same facts in black and white. finally a a great use for AI.

</details>

### 社区的力量与未来

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: 我们在这个系列中给出了很多建议，我们会把所有的建议都列在这一集的节目笔记中。关于成为自己的维权者，另一个细节是，你的朋友、邻居和你周围的人可能不会像你一样为自己维权。Gregory 在这一年开始时发现这很难接受。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: We've tossed out a lot of advice in this series, and we'll list all of it in the show notes for this episode. One other detail about becoming your own advocate is that your friends and neighbors and the people around you might not advocate for themselves in the same way you do. Gregory found this difficult in the beginning of his year.

</details>

**Gregory Han**: 我想我在 Wirecutter 和其他媒体的工作经历让我习惯了成为某些领域的专家。我想最初发生这件事时，我进入了“专家模式”、“研究员模式”，深入研究我需要做的事情，然后利用这些信息试图帮助其他人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregory Han**: I think the work that I've done for Wire Cutter and for other outlets, I've been asked to be an expert in things. I think initially when this happened, I went into expert mode, researcher mode, like just really delving into what I needed to do and then using that information to try to help other people.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: 他会沮丧地看着邻居从保险公司拿走比应得更少的赔偿，或者跳过昂贵的污染物检测，声称风险被夸大了。最终，他意识到帮助他们的最好方式就是倾听。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: He would frustratedly watch neighbors take less than they could from insurance companies or skip expensive tests for contaminants they couldn't see or smell, claiming the risks were overblown anyway. Eventually, he realized the best way he could help was to just listen.

</details>

**Gregory Han**: 他们中的很多人都在掩饰自己的担忧，因为他们负担不起谨慎的代价。一旦我真正理解了这一点，我开始更加注意我传递信息的方式。“我听到了。我明白这真的很贵。也许我们可以做一个测试。你知道，花 100 美元做这个。”但这并不总是一个选项。这就是我们所有人都悬而未决的地方。阿尔塔迪纳是一个非常中产阶级的社区。所以，我必须承认我的挫败感是合理的，就像他们的反应一样合理，我会努力与他们达成折中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregory Han**: A lot of them are masking their concerns because they're not able to afford to be careful. And once I really digested that, I started being much more caring about how I delivered that message. I hear you. I see this is really expensive. Maybe we can do one test. You know, spend the $100 to do this. It's not always a possibility. And that's what where we're all left floating. It's like Aladena is a very middle class neighborhood. So, I have to um recognize my frustration is valid just as much as their response, and I'm going to try to meet them halfway.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Gregory 的许多邻居都是老年人，靠固定收入生活，检测和修复的费用远超他们的承受能力。Gregory 说，现在他尝试以身作则，分享他使用过的服务信息和资源，并在分享自己的决定之前先倾听邻居的担忧。

听 Gregory 和 Mike 的故事很容易觉得遥远，觉得那是别人的生活，这种事不会发生在我身上。但灾难的特点是它们可能发生在任何人身上，你现在的所作所为可能会对你的未来产生巨大的影响。确保你了解你的保险单。阅读它。查阅你不理解的术语，并买够保额。将你的重要文件数字化。坦诚面对你的气候风险，如果可以的话，相应地改造你的家。如果你确实经历了自然灾害，记住你必须成为自己坚定的维权者。

然后是我们最初的感悟：在灾难发生前投资你的社区。我们想再次回到这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Many of Gregory's neighbors are elderly, living on fixed incomes, and the cost for testing and remediation are far beyond what they can afford. Gregory says now he tries to lead by example, sharing information and resources of the services he's used and listening to the concerns and decisions of his neighbors before sharing his own. It's easy to listen to Gregory and Mike's stories and feel far removed to think this is someone else's life and something like this won't happen to me. But the thing about disasters is they can happen to anyone and what you do now may have an outsized impact on your future. Make sure you understand your insurance policy. Read it. Look up terms you don't understand and get enough of it. Digitize your important documents. Be brutally honest about your climate risk and modify your home accordingly if you can. And if you do experience a natural disaster, remember that you will have to become your own fierce advocate. Then there's our original takeaway. Invest in your community before a disaster. We want to revisit that point.

</details>

**Mike Cohen**: 在这里右转。这是爱默生路（Emerson Way）。这是我的街区。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Cohen**: Turn right here. So this is Emerson Way. This is my block.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: 我们与 Mike 在阿尔塔迪纳的参观结束于他在爱默生路的房产，那是西阿尔塔迪纳中间的一个小尽头路街区。开车回到这里感觉如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: The tour we took with Mike through Altadena ended at his property on Emerson Way, a small culde-sac block in the middle of West Altadena. How does it feel driving back here?

</details>

**Mike Cohen**: 悲伤。就像一个空壳。我们街区没有一栋房子幸存。右边这里是我的地块。那是 Lisa 的房产，她打电话给我们家时就在那里。是的，我们整个街区都没了。那是 Kate 和 Taylor 的房子，我们的邻居，他们刚生了孩子。那是 Sue 的房子，已经在她家族里传了好几代。Daryl 住在隔壁，他在阿尔塔迪纳长大，他说他比我们刚搬进来时还了解我们的房子，因为他说他小时候就在那玩。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Cohen**: Sad. Like a shell of what it was. No houses on our block survived. And this is my plot over here on the right. That's Lisa's property where she was when she called our house. Yeah. Our whole block is gone. That was Kate and Taylor's house. Our neighbor. They had just had a kid. That was Sue's house. Um, been in her family for generations. Daryl lived next door to that. He grew up in Altadena and said that he knew our house better than we did when we first moved in cuz he said he grew up playing there when he was a kid.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: 和他一样，Mike 所有的邻居仍然流离失所。他不知道他们大多数人最终去了哪里，或者是否计划回来，但他仍与其中许多人保持联系。他通过像“**伊顿火灾幸存者网络**”这样的幸存者团体认识了更多的人。Mike 说，这些联系，特别是与那些经历过他所经历的一切、正在经历他所经历的一切的人的联系，是他这一年的基石。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Like him, all of Mike's neighbors are still displaced from Altadena. He doesn't know where most of them ended up or if they plan to come back, but he's still in communication with many of them. And he's met even more through fire survivor groups like the Eaten Fire Survivors Network. These connections, specifically with other people who've been through what he's been through, who are going through what he's going through. Mike says they've been a bedrock of his year.

</details>

**Mike Cohen**: 我们现在有了这道伤疤。它是隐形的，但我们带着它行走，它无处不在。好消息是，外面还有其他人也有同样的伤疤，他们理解的方式是那些没有这道伤疤的人无法理解的。当我与其他火灾幸存者联系时，他们能以我无法表达的方式理解那种挫败、悲伤、感激、愤怒和失落。但和他们在一起，我不需要表达，因为他们就是懂。所以建议是，在灾难发生前你越了解你的社区，那些纽带就越牢固，因为它会把你们团结在一起。但如果你们聚在一起时不需要第一次去记别人的名字，那就太好了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Cohen**: We have this scar now. It's invisible. but we walk with it and it's everpresent. The good news is that there are other people out there who also have that same scar and they understand in ways that people who don't have that scar can't. When I connect with other fire survivors who are going through the same things as I'm going through, they get the frustration, the grief, the gratitude, the anger, and the loss in ways that I'm not able to convey. But with them, I don't have to cuz they just get it. So the advice is the better you can know your community before that catastrophe happens, the stronger those bonds will be cuz it will bring you all together. But it would be great if it brought you together and you didn't have to remember people's names for the first time.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Gregory 也与社区里的人变得更亲近了。他和妻子在街对面邻居家度过了感恩节。他也对更广泛的朋友圈有了新的感激。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Gregory has also gotten closer with people in his community. He and his wife spent Thanksgiving across the street with their neighbors. He's also gained a new level of appreciation for his wider circle.

</details>

**Gregory Han**: 我记得有一个晚上，我们招待了一群朋友吃海鲜大餐，在那几个小时里，我忘记了我们流离失所，因为我们被朋友包围着，我们只是在笑、在吃，度过了一段美好的时光。那个夜晚的影响持续了好几天，因为我记起人们仍然关心并以我们意想不到的方式照顾着我们。我回顾发生过和正在发生的一切，这提醒我：我们过的这种生活是如此多其他互动的总和，这些互动以你无法预料的方式得到回报。我是说，有些人出现了，我甚至不知道他们竟然这么关心我们。我不是随口一说，真的很令人惊叹：换做是我，我会为你付出同样的努力吗？谢谢你们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gregory Han**: I remember one one evening we hosted a group of friends to have a seafood boil and for that few hours I forgot we were displaced because we were surrounded by friends and we were just laughing and eating and having a wonderful time. The effects of that evening lasted several days because I remembered that people still care and were looking out for us in ways that were unknown to us until it happened. I look back at what happened has happened and continues to happen as a reminder of like this life we live is the sum of so many other interactions that pay off in ways that you just couldn't expect. I mean, there was people who showed up like I didn't know that they cared that much about us. And and I don't mean that like, you know, in a flippant way. It was really like, wow, would have I made that effort for you? Thank you.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: 回到阿尔塔迪纳，我们又和 Mike 一起开了几个街区。虽然许多地块都是空的，但我惊讶于竟然有这么多正在施工。哇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: Back in Altadena, we drive along a few more blocks with Mike. Although many of the lots are empty, I'm surprised by how many are under construction. Wow.

</details>

**Mike Cohen**: 我听到的是大量的施工声。我听到了圆锯声和锤子声。我们在这里看到了这么多破坏，这么多空地。但也有很多地块上有人在做不同的事情，在工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Cohen**: What I hear is a lot of construction. I hear a lot of, you know, circular saws and hammers and we've seen there's so much devastation here. So many empty lots. There are also a lot of lots with people on them doing different things, working.

</details>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: 我们停下来与两位牵着狗的阿尔塔迪纳居民交谈。他们经历了火灾并已经搬了回来。他们说，社区里的这些新建筑让他们感到更加乐观。回到 Mike 的地块，我的制片人 Abigail 问 Mike，如果没有财务限制，他是否想搬回来重建？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Cyr Clisset**: We stopped to talk with two Altadena residents walking a dog called Azie. They'd lived through the fire and had already moved back. This new construction in the neighborhood, they said, made them feel more optimistic. Back at Mike's plot, my producer Abigail asked Mike if there were no financial constraints, would he want to move back and rebuild?

</details>

**Mike Cohen**: 如果金钱不是做决定的因素，而且我有资金重建，是的，我们早就开始重建了。我不确定我会搬回什么样的环境，但总有人会来这里生活，总有人会重建。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Cohen**: If the money wasn't the thing that was making the decision for us and I had the funds to rebuild, yeah, we would have started rebuilding already, I'm not sure what I'd be moving back to. But somebody's going to come live here and somebody's going to rebuild.
