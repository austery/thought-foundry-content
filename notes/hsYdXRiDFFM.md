title: FEMA 削减援助，特朗普‘黄金卡’签证开放，以及其他新闻速递

### FEMA 削减灾难援助：政治动机引发担忧

近期，美国联邦紧急事务管理局（FEMA）在灾难援助方面采取了更为保守的姿态，这引起了广泛关注。马里兰州西部港镇（Western Port, Maryland）遭受了严重的洪水侵袭，造成了巨大的破坏，包括房屋被淹、车辆和碎片漂浮在街道上。在评估了约3000万美元的清理费用后，当地官员向FEMA提交了财政援助申请，但却被两次拒绝。

<p class="english-text">Back in May, some of the heaviest rain out to the west in western Maryland. Flash floods there and more flooding risk today. A slowmoving storm system moved over the small town of Western Port, Maryland. And as the rain poured down, flood waters rose. Cars and debris seen floating in the school parking lot. Soon, the elementary school was swamped. The town hall was flooded. Books from the city library were scattered across town amid the debris. Mud. Everything here is mud. Look, there goes a truck loaded down with the mud that they've just scraped up off the street. With so much destruction, state officials put in a request to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for financial support. FEMA's response, denied. Local officials assumed that was some kind of bureaucratic mixup, so they submitted a more thorough damage report that estimated cleanup costs at about $30 million. FEMA's response, denied.</p>

### FEMA 援助政策的转变与政治影响

这种情况在全国范围内变得越来越普遍。在特朗普政府的领导下，FEMA（联邦紧急事务管理局）在资助灾难恢复方面变得不那么积极。灾难援助金被大幅削减，一些已批准的款项也出现延迟。特朗普总统明确表示，他希望将更多的灾难恢复负担转移给各州，甚至一度提出要关闭FEMA。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, that situation is becoming more and more familiar for communities across the country as FEMA under the Trump administration has become much less willing to fund disaster recovery. aid has been significantly scaled back and in some cases payments that are approved have been delayed. President Trump has made it clear he wants to shift more of the burden of disaster recovery to states, even floating the idea of shuttering FEMA altogether at one point.</p>
</details>

### 联邦援助的政治化指控

更令人担忧的是，特朗普总统还曾将联邦援助作为政治武器，试图惩罚那些不配合其移民政策的州，通过阻止灾难资金来施压。就在FEMA拒绝向马里兰州（一个民主党执政的州）提供资金的同一天，特朗普却批准了向阿拉斯加州、内布拉斯加州和北达科他州提供联邦援助，这些州都在去年的总统大选中支持了他。马里兰州州长向《纽约时报》表示，他认为洪水恢复请求被拒绝是因为该州由民主党控制。一位代表西部港镇的县委员（他本人是共和党人）也表示认同，称“我们是意识形态的受害者”。FEMA在一份声明中表示，已分析了损害信息，数据显示不支持提供援助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But he's also used federal assistance as a political weapon, trying to punish states that refuse to cooperate with his immigration crackdown by blocking disaster funding. On the same day that FEMA denied funding to Maryland, a blue state, Trump approved federal aid for Alaska, Nebraska, and North Dakota, all states that supported him in last year's presidential election. Maryland's governor told the Times he thinks the flood recovery request was denied because it's a Democratic controlled state. And a county commissioner representing the town of Westernport, who is a Republican, agreed, saying, quote, "We're strictly a victim of ideology." In a statement, FEMA said it had analyzed the damage information and that the data didn't support sending aid.</p>
</details>

### FEMA 新官员背景引发质疑

与此同时，特朗普政府刚刚任命了一位新的官员来负责FEMA中负责权衡是否应向社区发送联邦灾难援助的办公室。这位被任命者名叫格雷格·菲利普斯（Greg Phillips），他曾在州人力服务机构工作，但其领英（LinkedIn）个人资料并未列出任何在应急管理方面的专业经验。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Meanwhile, the Trump administration has just appointed a new official to oversee the office at FEMA that weighs in on whether federal disaster aid should be sent to communities. The appointee, Greg Phillips, has worked in state human services agencies, but his LinkedIn profile doesn't list any professional experience in emergency management.</p>
</details>

### 选举舞弊阴谋论者掌管灾难援助审批

更令人担忧的是，菲利普斯一直是选举舞弊阴谋论的主要支持者。根据事实核查网站Politifact的报道，关于数百万非公民投票的未经证实的说法，特朗普本人也曾放大过这些说法，其源头可以追溯到菲利普斯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Phillips has been a leading proponent of election fraud conspiracies. According to the fact-checking site Politifact, unsubstantiated claims about millions of noncitizens voting, which Trump himself amplified, can be traced back to Phillips.</p>

### 美国扣押委内瑞拉油轮：地缘政治施压升级

在其他新闻方面，美国最近在委内瑞拉海岸扣押了一艘大型油轮。特朗普总统宣布，美国已于前一天控制了一艘载有石油的船只，但未提供具体细节，仅表示该船只被扣押是“事出有因”。美国政府分享的画面显示，美国特种部队从直升机降落在油轮甲板上。美国官员告诉《纽约时报》，该船载有委内瑞拉石油，此次扣押是美国政府持续对委内瑞拉领导人尼古拉斯·马杜罗（Nicholas Maduro）施压行动的一部分，委内瑞拉高度依赖石油收入。据一位官员称，联邦法官近期发出搜查令要求扣押该船只，因为该船只过去曾被用于走私伊朗石油。

<p class="english-text">Now, three other quick updates on the Trump administration. As you probably know, we've just uh seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela. Large tanker, very large. President Trump announced that the US took control of a ship carrying oil yesterday, providing no specifics other than saying that it was seized, quote, for a very good reason. Footage shared by the administration appeared to show US forces repelling down from a helicopter onto the deck of the tanker. US officials tell the Times it was carrying Venezuelan oil and that the seizure is part of the administration's ongoing pressure campaign on Nicholas Maduro, the leader of Venezuela, whose country is highly dependent on oil revenue. According to an official, a federal judge recently issued a warrant for the seizure because the vessel had been used in the past to smuggle oil from Iran.</p>

### 特朗普“黄金卡”签证开放：吸引投资还是特权通道？

此外，美国政府推出的“特朗普黄金卡”（Trump Gold Card）——一项针对百万美元投资者的快速通道签证计划——的申请现已正式开放。白宫将这些签证定位为一种筹集数十亿美元资金并吸引所谓“最优秀人才”，如企业家和投资者的方式。然而，批评者认为，新计划将不公平地优先考虑富裕个人，他们可能在申请后几周内就能获得美国居留权。要获得黄金卡资格，申请人需要支付一笔15,000美元且不可退还的处理费。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Also, applications are now officially open for an expedited visa. the US government plans to offer for $1 million, dubbed the Trump Gold card. Basically, it's a green card, but much better, much more powerful. The White House has framed the visas as a way to raise billions of dollars for the government and attract what it calls the best people like entrepreneurs and investors. Critics say the new program will unfairly prioritize wealthy individuals who will be able to get US residency potentially just weeks after applying. To be eligible for a gold card, applicants will have to pay a $15,000 processing fee that's non-refundable.</p>

### 美国环保署重估化学品风险：甲醛暴露标准引争议

最后，美国环保署（EPA）正在重新评估某些化学品的风险，首先从甲醛（formaldehyde）开始。这种致癌气体被用于生产许多消费品，如油漆、塑料、家具、服装，甚至用于一些头发拉直处理。现在，特朗普政府提议将所谓的安全暴露水平提高近一倍，这颠覆了早期认为该化学品任何暴露都危险的结论。这一转变对化工行业来说是一个巨大的胜利，该行业多年来一直在游说反对对甲醛实施严格监管。他们认为，对该气体的新限制将使企业成本高昂，而工人可以通过呼吸器等设备得到保护。在特朗普政府任内，负责监督EPA化学品安全的最高两名官员均曾是化工行业团体的前负责人。

<p class="english-text">And last update, the Environmental Protection Agency is reassessing the risks of certain chemicals, starting with firmaldahhide. The cancercausing gas is used in the production of a lot of consumer goods, paints, plastics, furniture, clothing, and it's even used in some hair straightening treatments. Now, the Trump administration is proposing to almost double what's considered a safe level of exposure, upending earlier findings that said basically any exposure to the chemical is dangerous. The shift is a big win for the chemicals industry, which has been lobbying against strict regulations on formaldahhide for years. It's argued that new limits on the gas would be expensive for businesses and that workers can instead be protected by things like respirators. Under Trump, the top two officials overseeing chemical safety at the EPA are former directors of a chemicals industry group.</p>

### 美联储降息决策面临两难：经济挑战与数据困境

在经济方面，美联储主席杰罗姆·鲍威尔（Jerome Powell）宣布再次降息，但这一决策存在争议，政策制定者在如何推进问题上存在分歧。鲍威尔承认，他们正面临两种不同的经济威胁，这两种威胁需要两种不同的策略：就业市场的持续动荡可能需要进一步降息，而不断上升的通货膨胀则可能意味着需要加息。他表示：“所以，你该怎么做？你只有一个工具。你不能同时做两件事。那么，你以多快的速度前进？你做出多大的调整，以及诸如此类的事情？以及它们的时间安排？这是一个非常具有挑战性的局面。”在做出决定之前，由于政府关门导致关键通胀和劳动力市场数据收集中断或延迟，美联储对美国经济健康状况的可见度比平时要低。

<p class="english-text">We judged it appropriate at this meeting to lower our policy rate by a quarter percentage point. At the Federal Reserve yesterday, the chair Jerome Powell announced that interest rates will be lowered once again, but it was a contentious decision with the policy makers split on how to proceed. Powell acknowledged that they're facing down two different economic threats that call for two different strategies. Continued shakiness in the job market might require cutting rates more, while growing inflation might mean raising them. So, what do you do? You've got one tool. You can't do two things at once. So, at what pace do you move? What size moves do you make and that kind of thing? And what what's the timing of them? It's a very challenging situation. Ahead of the decision, the Fed had less visibility into the health of the US economy than usual because the government shutdown disrupted or delayed the gathering of key inflation and labor market data.</p>

### 卢浮宫盗窃案细节披露：安保漏洞暴露

在巴黎，调查人员披露了卢浮宫珠宝盗窃案的新细节，以及导致案件发生的安保漏洞。最初，博物馆馆长表示，窃贼之所以能够 undetected 潜入，是因为一个关键的安全摄像头朝向了别处。但现在，调查人员称，尽管犯罪过程被摄像头捕捉到，但安保人员并未观看，因为控制室没有足够的屏幕同时显示所有监控画面。他们花了8分钟才切换到正确的画面。在昨天提交给法国参议院的证词中，调查人员还表示，警方可能能够抓住窃贼，但博物馆工作人员未能提供必要的信息。警官最初去了建筑的错误一侧，浪费了宝贵的时间。在窃贼逃离30秒后，他们才到达正确地点。虽然有多人因盗窃案被捕，但巴黎检察官近期表示，价值1亿美元的被盗珠宝尚未找到。

<p class="english-text">In Paris, investigators revealed new details about the jewelry heist at the Louvre and the security lapses that allowed it to happen. Originally, the museum's director said the thieves had managed to get in undetected because a key security camera was facing the other way. Now, investigators say the crime was caught on camera, but the security guards weren't watching it because there weren't enough screens in the control room to see every surveillance feed simultaneously. It took 8 minutes for them to toggle over to the right feed. In testimony to the French Senate yesterday, investigators also said police might have been able to catch the thieves before they escaped, but that museum staff didn't give them the information they needed. The officers originally went to the wrong side of the building, wasting precious time. They got to the correct spot 30 seconds after the thieves had made their getaway. While multiple people have been arrested in connection with the heist, a Paris prosecutor said recently that the 100 million of stolen jewelry had yet to be found.</p>

### 畅销书作家费恩·迈克尔斯逝世，享年92岁

最后，200多部浪漫小说和惊悚小说的畅销书作家费恩·迈克尔斯（Fern Michaels）去世，享年92岁。她曾表示，成为作家是在丈夫的“严厉鼓励”下开始的。她自称是新泽西的一位家庭主妇，抚养着五个孩子，当时她说：“我丈夫告诉我，‘别再闲着了，去找份工作’。”这是他原话。于是，她尝试了写作，并据她的出版商称，最终售出了约1.5亿册书籍，包括惊悚小说、家庭剧和悬疑小说。她还幽默地表示：“我现在没有那个丈夫了。”起初，她与一位写作伙伴合作写书，并共用“费恩·迈克尔斯”（Fern Michaels）的笔名，但后来她完全掌控了这个笔名。她的真名是玛丽·库什基尔（Mary Kushkir），但她受到了她客厅里一个巨大的塑料蕨类植物的启发。在其职业生涯中，她建立了一个虚构文学帝国。即使在90多岁高龄，她每年仍出版四本书。虽然她为自己的成功感到自豪，但她从不自诩为文学巨匠。“费恩·迈克尔斯是个好作家吗？”她在自己的网站上写道，“不。”

<p class="english-text">And finally, Fern Michaels, the best-selling author of more than 200 romance novels and thrillers, has died at age 92. She only became a writer, she said, after a blunt nudge from her husband. She was a self-described New Jersey housewife raising five kids when she said, "My husband told me to get off my ass and get a job." Those were his exact words. So, she gave writing a shot and went on to sell an estimated 150 million copies, according to her publisher. Bodis rippers along with family dramas and mysteries. Guess what she said? I don't have that husband anymore. At first, she worked with a writing partner on the books and they shared the pen name, Fern Michaels, though she later took full control of it. Her real name was Mary Kushkir, but she was inspired by a giant plastic fern she had in her living room. Over the course of her career, she built a fiction empire. Even in her 90s, she was still publishing four books a year. While she was proud of her success, she never claimed to be a literary phenomenon. "Is Fern Michaels a good writer?" she wrote on her website. "No."</p>
