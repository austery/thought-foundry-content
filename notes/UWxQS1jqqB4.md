### 美元信用的轉折點與黃金的未來

上週五，黃金和白銀市場經歷了一場史詩級的跳水，許多投機者因此遭受損失。過去兩年，黃金價格的飆升令人矚目，但其本質作為避險資產的屬性，以及其價格上漲的根本原因——對美元信用的嚴重質疑——卻常被忽視。然而，就在上週五，隨著美聯儲新任主席**凱文·沃什（Kevin Warsh）**即將上任，這套關於美元崩潰的論調出現了轉折點。沃什被視為一位改革派，其核心任務是重建美聯儲的貨幣紀律，進而挽救美元信用。一旦美元信用的修復出現可能，黃金持續瘋漲的行情預計將告一段落。這對中國而言並非好消息，因為中國領導層在高價位囤積了大量黃金。因此，本期節目將深入探討凱文·沃什的拯救美元行動能否成功，以及美元信用若被修復，將對中國造成何種程度的衝擊。

Last Friday, gold and silver experienced an epic plunge, trapping many speculators. The surge in gold prices over the past two years has been extraordinary, leading many to forget its fundamental nature as a safe-haven asset. Its current valuation is largely driven by severe market doubts about the creditworthiness of the US dollar. However, this narrative of dollar collapse took a sharp turn last Friday with the impending arrival of **Kevin Warsh** as the new Federal Reserve Chair. He is a reformer tasked with rebuilding the Fed's monetary discipline and salvaging dollar credit. If the possibility of restoring dollar credit emerges, the daily surge in gold prices is likely to end. This is not good news for China's leadership, which has accumulated significant gold holdings at high prices. Therefore, this episode will delve into whether Kevin Warsh's 'Save the Dollar' initiative will succeed and the extent of the impact on China if dollar credit is repaired.

### 拯救美元行動的三大支柱

所謂的“拯救美元行動”，本質上是美國對過去數年過度揮霍財政的深刻反思。過去，美國財政部如同持有無限額信用卡，由美聯儲不斷印鈔提供支持。財政的揮霍導致國債激增，美聯儲為兜底而擴表，最終導致美國的財政紀律和貨幣紀律蕩然無存。如今，美國國債規模已達38萬億美元的驚人數字，市場普遍質疑美國能否僅靠稅收償還。普遍的預期是，美聯儲將不得不持續印鈔，最終可能導致美元貶值為廢紙，這正是美元信用被系統性削弱的根源，促使全球資本紛紛增持黃金作為對沖。在此背景下，以凱文·沃什為代表的美聯儲改革派，正試圖發起一場真正意義上的拯救美元行動，重塑其信用根基。為此，他們必須同時完成三項關鍵任務：
第一，重建貨幣紀律：確保市場相信美聯儲不再是財政部的提款機，而是回歸其作為獨立央行的職能，專注於控制通脹，而非在財政壓力下無限擴表。明確界限是止血美元信用的關鍵。
第二，恢復財政紀律：若美聯儲收緊銀根，但財政部繼續我行我素，赤字失控，市場最終仍會迫使美聯儲重回量化寬鬆（QE）。因此，拯救美元必須財政與貨幣雙管齊下，財政部需收斂開支。
第三，釋放經濟活力：美國需要一個令人信服的增長敘事，例如通過**人工智能（AI）**帶來的生產率提升和稅基擴大，以GDP增長緩慢降低債務率。美聯儲和財政部需協同合作，營造有利的宏觀環境，放鬆不必要監管，增加退稅，降低融資成本，鼓勵企業投資擴張，讓增長源於真實經濟活動，而非金融泡沫。

The so-called 'Save the Dollar' initiative is essentially a profound reflection by the United States on its excessive fiscal profligacy in recent years. Previously, the US Treasury acted as if it held an unlimited credit card, continuously supported by the Federal Reserve's money printing. Fiscal extravagance led to a surge in national debt, prompting the Fed to expand its balance sheet to provide backing, ultimately causing the abandonment of US fiscal and monetary discipline. Today, the US national debt stands at an astonishing $38 trillion, with the market widely doubting the US's ability to repay it solely through tax revenue. The prevailing expectation is that the Fed will have to continue printing money, potentially devaluing the dollar into worthless paper, which is the root cause of the systematic weakening of dollar credit, driving global capital to accumulate gold as a hedge. Against this backdrop, Fed reformers, led by Kevin Warsh, are attempting a genuine 'Save the Dollar' initiative to rebuild its credit foundation. To achieve this, they must accomplish three critical tasks simultaneously:
First, **rebuild monetary discipline**: Ensure the market believes the Fed is no longer a Treasury ATM but has returned to its role as an independent central bank, focusing on inflation control rather than endless balance sheet expansion under fiscal pressure. Clearly defining this boundary is crucial to stop the bleeding of dollar credit.
Second, **restore fiscal discipline**: If the Fed tightens monetary policy, but the Treasury continues its unchecked spending and deficits, the market will eventually force the Fed back to quantitative easing (QE). Therefore, saving the dollar requires a two-pronged approach where fiscal policy also restrains spending.
Third, **unleash economic vitality**: The US needs a convincing growth narrative, such as productivity gains and an expanded tax base driven by **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, to gradually reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio through economic growth. The Fed and Treasury must cooperate to create a favorable macroeconomic environment, relax unnecessary regulations, increase tax rebates, and lower financing costs to encourage business investment and expansion, allowing growth to stem from real economic activity rather than financial bubbles.

### 重塑美元信用：增長敘事與市場邏輯逆轉

歸根結底，所謂的拯救美元行動，就是要讓全世界重新相信，美國那38萬億美元的國債是可以通過經濟增長和稅收增加來逐步償還的，美國不會再走回過去財政赤字貨幣化的老路。一旦這套敘事被市場接受，整個資本市場的交易邏輯將發生逆轉。美元資產將重新成為全球最穩定的避風港，而黃金則會回歸其作為壓箱底的避險資產的本位，而非如今被視為投機工具。

<summary>Original English</summary>
Ultimately, the 'Save the Dollar' initiative aims to convince the world that the US's $38 trillion national debt can be gradually repaid through economic growth and increased tax revenues, and that the US will not revert to its past path of fiscal deficit monetization. If this narrative is accepted by the market, the entire capital market's trading logic will reverse. Dollar assets will once again become the world's most secure safe haven, and gold will return to its fundamental role as a last-resort hedge, rather than being treated as a speculative tool as it is today.

### 第一波衝擊：資本流動與中國的兩難

那麼，如果美元信用被重新修復，這對中國意味著什麼？美元的重新崛起對中國的衝擊，絕不僅僅是匯率強弱的問題，更深層次來看，中國將在資本、貿易和增長三個層面同時感受到來自美國的壓力，且這些壓力是層層遞進、互相強化的。
第一層衝擊是資本。全球資本如同現實的遊客，總是流向安全、規則清晰且能自由進出的地方。過去幾年，隨著美元信用受到質疑，部分全球資本轉向黃金，另一部分則分散到其他國家尋找美元替代方案。一旦市場開始相信美元信用可能被修復，這些資本的首要反應往往不是冒險，而是回歸他們最熟悉的地方——美國。這並不意味著外資會立即全部撤離中國，但境內的外資將變得更加挑剔和現實。
這可能導致中國出現三種連鎖反應：
1.  中國央行的降息空間將變小。試圖通過降息刺激經濟，將不得不顧慮利差變化可能引發的匯率預期鬆動和資金外流。
2.  中國資產將相對變得更廉價。與外部更確定、更安全的美元資產相比，全球資本會提高對中國資產的要求，迫使中國以更低價格出售或提供更高回報。
3.  地方債和房地產等風險的處理難度將增加。中國目前處理這些歷史包袱的核心策略是將風險後移，等待經濟復甦消化。但這一策略的前提是外部環境不能過於嚴峻，全球流動性不能驟然抽緊。若美元走強、資本回流美國，外部環境收緊，中國留給自身緩衝的時間將大大縮短，這些債務問題將更難以避免爆雷。

So, what does the potential restoration of dollar credit mean for China? The resurgence of the dollar poses a challenge to China that goes far beyond simple exchange rate fluctuations. On a deeper level, China will face pressure from the US simultaneously across three fronts: capital, trade, and growth, with these pressures being cumulative and mutually reinforcing.
The first impact is on **capital**. Global capital behaves like pragmatic tourists, always flowing to places that are safe, have clear rules, and allow free entry and exit. In recent years, as dollar credit was questioned, some global capital moved into gold, while other portions diversified into various countries seeking alternatives to the dollar. Once the market begins to believe that dollar credit can be repaired, the primary reaction of these capitals is often not to take further risks, but to return to the familiar territory of the United States. This does not imply an immediate mass exodus of foreign capital from China, but foreign capital within China will become more discerning and pragmatic.
This could lead to three chain reactions in China:
1.  The People's Bank of China's (PBOC) room for interest rate cuts will shrink. Attempts to stimulate the economy through lower rates will have to consider whether changes in interest rate differentials might loosen exchange rate expectations and facilitate capital outflow.
2.  Chinese assets will become relatively cheaper. Compared to more certain and safer dollar assets abroad, global capital will raise its requirements for Chinese assets, either demanding higher returns or accepting lower prices.
3.  Managing risks like local government debt and real estate will become more difficult. China's current core strategy for handling these historical burdens is to defer risks, waiting for economic recovery to digest them. However, this approach implicitly assumes that the external environment will not become too harsh and global liquidity will not be suddenly withdrawn. If the dollar strengthens and capital flows back to the US, tightening the external environment, China's buffer time will be significantly reduced, making it harder to avoid debt defaults.

### 第二、三波衝擊：貿易重塑與增長困境

第二層衝擊是貿易。乍一看，美元走強似乎有利於中國出口，但這種看法過於片面。美國此次拯救美元的框架，不僅包含強勢美元，更結合了加強產業鏈和輸出規則的策略。這意味著，美國將不再僅僅與中國拼價格或匯率，而是要重塑全球貿易秩序。未來的國際貿易將面臨更嚴格的供應鏈規則、原產地要求，以及更多以安全合規為名的貿易門檻，甚至可能涉及關鍵行業的限制，這些措施明顯針對中國。在此環境下，中國面對的將是一場圍繞供應鏈話語權的長期消耗戰，而非簡單的匯率戰。結果可能是，中國出口規模不一定會立即大幅下滑，但企業利潤將被持續壓縮，中美貿易摩擦成本不斷上升，中國依靠出口賺取的利潤將越來越微薄。
當中國更難留住外資、更難通過貿易獲利時，最終將面臨第三層衝擊——增長壓力。對中國而言，經濟增長至關重要，不僅關乎面子，更關乎債務能否解決、失業問題能否緩解、社會能否保持穩定。在此情況下，中國的出路似乎是學習美國，提升生產率，特別是依靠AI革命來擴大GDP。然而，美國走的路是在美元信用修復、資本回流、規則佔優的前提下進行的。而中國若要走同一條路，卻面臨外部環境惡劣、資金緊縮、規則不友好的挑戰。這條路是否還能走通？這是一個現實的問題，需要考察民營企業的擴張意願、長期投資的增加情況，以及中國AI技術能否真正提升各行各業的效率和利潤。如果這些Improvements are not visible，中國的GDP增長很可能仍依賴政府加槓桿、投資衝量和債務續命的老路。而這恰恰是美國試圖糾正的危險之路。一旦中國的債務依賴財政赤字貨幣化而非真實經濟增長和稅基擴大來解決，那麼在中美對抗的大賽中，中國將逐步落於下風，難以追趕。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
The second impact is on **trade**. At first glance, a stronger dollar might seem beneficial for Chinese exports, but this view is overly simplistic. The US strategy to save the dollar this time combines not only a strong dollar but also strengthening supply chains and exporting rules. This means the US will no longer compete solely on price or exchange rates with China but aims to reshape the global trade order. Future international trade will face stricter supply chain rules, origin requirements, and more trade barriers justified by security and compliance, potentially including restrictions on key industries – measures clearly targeting China. In this environment, China will face a long-term war of attrition over supply chain influence, rather than a simple exchange rate battle. The likely outcome is that while China's export volume may not immediately decline sharply, corporate profits will be continuously squeezed, trade friction costs will rise, and the profits earned from exports will become increasingly meager.
When China finds it harder to retain foreign capital and earn profits from trade, it will ultimately face the third impact: **growth pressure**. For China, economic growth is crucial, not just for appearances, but for resolving debt, alleviating unemployment, and maintaining social stability. In this scenario, China's path forward seems to be emulating the US by boosting productivity, particularly leveraging the AI revolution to expand GDP. However, the path the US is taking is under the premise of restored dollar credit, capital repatriation, and regulatory advantage. If China attempts the same path, it faces adverse external conditions, tight liquidity, and unfriendly regulations. Can this path still be viable? This is a realistic question that requires examining the willingness of private enterprises to expand, the increase in long-term investment, and whether China's AI technology can truly enhance efficiency and profits across industries. If these improvements are not visible, China's GDP growth will likely continue on its old path of government leverage, investment-driven expansion, and debt-fueled sustenance. This is precisely the dangerous path the US is trying to correct. If China's debt continues to be resolved through fiscal deficit monetization rather than real economic growth and tax base expansion, China will gradually fall behind in the great contest with the US, making it difficult to catch up.

### 全球信用重塑：中國面臨的系統性考驗

總而言之，所謂的“拯救美元行動”，表面上看只是美聯儲更換了主席，黃金白銀價格出現回調。但其底層真正發生的是全球信用體系的重新排序。美國試圖將市場從美元崩潰的預期中拉回，通過貨幣紀律止血，財政紀律約束，再以AI帶來的生產率敘事補血，讓世界重新相信美元可以依靠增長而非印鈔來償還債務。一旦這個敘事成立，全球資本將重新將美元資產視為默認選項，市場交易邏輯逆轉，黃金從投機熱點回歸保險資產。美國將重新掌握其可怕的美元霸權，獲得便宜融資、資本回流和規則輸出的優勢。
這一切對中國這個美國最大的競爭對手而言，無疑是一個噩耗。美元的回歸崛起，衝擊的絕非僅是人民幣匯率的漲跌，而是迫使中國接受一次系統性的壓力測試：外資更難留住，外貿更難賺錢，GDP增長更難實現。最終，中國必須回答一個核心問題：能否依靠提升生產率來消化債務，而非依賴印鈔續命？如果經濟能夠增長，那麼當前的外部逆境僅是陣痛；如果經濟無法增長，那麼中國走的將是美國過去那條正在被糾正的老路，最終深陷財政赤字貨幣化的泥潭，無法自拔。
從目前中美兩國的經濟基本面來看，中國似乎難以找回財政和貨幣紀律，而美國卻在進行自我拯救和反思。從制度優勢的角度來看，哪個國家更具優勢，這個問題就留給中國領導層去思考吧。

In summary, the so-called 'Save the Dollar' initiative, on the surface, appears to be merely a change in the Federal Reserve Chair and a pullback in gold and silver prices. However, at its core, it represents a reordering of the global credit system. The US aims to pull the market back from expectations of dollar collapse, using monetary discipline to stop the bleeding, fiscal discipline to impose constraints, and the narrative of AI-driven productivity to replenish its strength. The goal is to make the world believe again that the dollar can repay its debts through growth, not money printing. If this narrative holds, global capital will once again view dollar assets as the default option, market trading logic will reverse, and gold will shift from a speculative hotspot back to an insurance asset. The US will regain its formidable dollar hegemony, benefiting from cheap financing, capital repatriation, and regulatory influence.
For China, the US's greatest competitor, this resurgence of the dollar is undoubtedly bad news. The impact of the dollar's return is not merely about the appreciation or depreciation of the RMB, but rather forces China to undergo a systemic stress test: it will be harder to retain foreign capital, harder to earn profits from foreign trade, and harder to achieve GDP growth. Ultimately, China must answer a core question: can it resolve its debt by increasing productivity, rather than relying on money printing? If its economy can grow, then current external adversities are merely growing pains; if its economy cannot grow, then China will be following the old path that the US is now trying to correct, ultimately becoming mired in fiscal deficit monetization and unable to extricate itself.
Looking at the current economic fundamentals of both China and the US, it seems difficult for China to regain fiscal and monetary discipline, while the US is engaged in self-salvation and reflection. From the perspective of institutional advantage, which country holds the upper hand is a question left for China's leadership to ponder.
