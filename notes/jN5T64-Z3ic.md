### 序言

**Anna Martin**: 大家好，我是**安娜·马丁**，这里是**《摩登情爱》**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: I'm **Anna Martin**. This is **Modern Love**.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 像许多孩子一样，**茱莉亚·史塔勒**从小觉得她爸爸有点古板。他彬彬有礼，总是准时，非常中西部风格。她爱他，但觉得他们没什么共同点。然而，当她长大上大学后，她爸爸宣布了一个震惊全家的消息。突然间，茱莉亚意识到她根本不了解她爸爸。今天，我与茱莉亚聊了聊从零开始与爸爸建立关系的感觉，以及当他们最终对彼此坦诚相待时发生了什么。**茱莉亚·史塔勒**，欢迎来到**《摩登情爱》**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Growing up, like a lot of kids, **Julia Staler** thought her dad was just kind of a square. He was polite, always on time, very Midwestern, that sort of thing. She loved him, but she didn't think they had much in common. But after she grew up and went to college, her dad made an announcement that shocked their family. And suddenly, Julia realized she didn't know her dad at all. Today, I talked to Julia about what it was like to build a relationship with her dad from scratch, and what happened when they were finally honest with each other. Julia Staler, welcome to **Modern Love**.

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 很高兴来到这里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: So happy to be here.

</details>

### 父亲的惊人出柜

**Anna Martin**: 茱莉亚，我们直接开始吧。我想从你和你爸爸的一次电话聊起，那次通话几乎改变了你对他的一切认知。带我回到那个时候。你在哪里？发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Julia, I'm going to hop right in with you. And I want to start with a phone call you had with your dad that changed pretty much everything you thought you knew about him. Take me there. Where were you? What happened?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 我当时正在公寓外面解锁自行车，然后我的手机响了，是我妈妈打来的。她突然说：“你爸爸是**双性恋**，他要离开我了。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: I'm unlocking my bike outside my apartment and then my phone rings and it's my mom. Out of nowhere, she says, "Your father's a bisexual." And he's leaving me.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 等等，等等。她对你说了这些。自行车呢？你当时身体有什么反应？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Wait, hold on. She says this to you. Where's the bike? Like, what's happening in your body?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 我把自行车锁掉在地上，然后瘫坐在地上。我记得我站不住了。我想，等等，我是应该进屋吗？我应该吗？然后我就瘫坐了下来。感觉就像慢动作一样。我觉得自己像在玩电子游戏，世界在我面前晃动，但我几乎没注意到。我坐在地上，但感觉不到地面。我听到这个声音，但无法理解那是我爸爸的声音。我感到**“解离”**。是的，真的**“解离”**了。我对此的记忆实际上是我看着自己坐在地上，有点像**“灵魂出窍”**的体验。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: I dropped my bike lock and I sink to the floor. I remember I couldn't hold my body up. I think I'm like, wait, should I go inside? Should I? So then I just sink down. It's like slow motion. I feel like I'm in a video game where the world is kind of moving around in front of me, but I'm barely paying attention to it. And I'm sitting on the ground, but I don't really feel the ground. I'm hearing this voice, but it's not computing that it's my dad. Dissociating. Yeah. Really disassociating. And my memories of it actually are of me looking at myself on the ground. Kind of an out-of-body experience.

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 所以，我坐在地上。我给我爸爸打电话。我说：“妈妈刚刚说你是**双性恋**。”然后他说那是真的。他说话声音很轻，我也说话声音很轻。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: So, I'm down sitting down on the ground. Call my dad. I said, "Mom just said you were bisexual." And then he said that was true. And he was talking very quietly. And I was talking very quietly.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 他的声音听起来不一样吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Did his voice sound different?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 是的，听起来像另一个人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: Yeah, it sounded like a different person.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 嗯？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Huh?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 我觉得整个电话都是慢动作，因为我听到我爸爸的声音，我理解他的话，但我一直在想：“这个人是谁？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: And I think the whole phone call was in slow motion because I was hearing my dad's voice and I was understanding his words, but I kept thinking, "Who is this man?"

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 是的。因为它就是无法理解。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Yeah. Because it just didn't compute.

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 这与我父亲的形象完全**“180度大转弯”**。我不得不一直对自己说：“电话那头是我爸爸。我正在和我爸爸说话。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: It was 180° away from who my father was. I kept having to say, "This is my dad on the phone. I'm talking to my dad."

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 对你自己说？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: To yourself?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 是的。他说的那些话，是从我爸爸嘴里说出来的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: Yes. the words he's saying, it's coming from my dad's mouth.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 嗯，他描述了他在遇到你妈妈之前就已经出柜了，后来又回到了**“柜子”**里，但现在他感到**“死气沉沉”**，再也无法忍受了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Um, and he describes how he had been out before he had met my mom and had gone back into the closet, but now he felt dead inside and he couldn't take it anymore.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 我是说，那句话真的很有力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: I mean, that language is really strong.

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: Mhm.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 他是怎么说出那些话的？我是说，我知道你说他的声音听起来不一样，有一种不同的质感、不同的语调。当他说**“死气沉沉”**时，他是平静地说出来的吗？我是说，这真是一个强烈的宣告。我很好奇你听起来是怎样的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: How did he say those words? I mean, I know that you're saying his voice sounded different. There's like a different texture, different tone. When he said dead inside, did he say it plainly? Did he say it? I mean, I just It's such a strong declaration. I'm curious how he how that sounded to you.

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 他从来没有和我谈论过他的感受。所以，在我们关系中，他第一次向我敞开心扉谈论他的感受，而这种感受是**“死气沉沉”**，这很难接受。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: He never talked to me about how he was feeling. So, the fact that one of the first times in our relationship, he's opening up about how he's feeling, and the feeling is that he's dead inside was hard.

</details>

### 父女互相出柜

**Anna Martin**: 他告诉你这些，你正在消化这些，然后呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: He tells you this, you're processing this, and then and then what?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 我告诉他我是**双性恋**，这是我从未告诉过他的，因为我以为他不会理解。结果我们有这个共同点。但我之所以觉得我永远无法告诉他，是因为他把这件事埋藏得太深了，以至于……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: I tell him that I'm bisexual, which is something that I had never told him because I thought he wouldn't understand. And turns out we had this in common. But the reason I felt like I could never tell him was because he had been burying this thing in so deep that

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 他变成了一个你无法倾诉、无法真正谈论自己性取向的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: he became a person who you couldn't confide in, who you couldn't really talk about your sexuality with.

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 是的，我一直以为他是世界上最直的男人，会觉得这很奇怪、很困惑，无法理解。结果，那些让我不想告诉他的原因，恰恰隐藏了他真实的身份，而这正是我们共同的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: And someone I just figured was the straightest guy who ever lived, who would think it was kind of weird and confusing and wouldn't get it. And instead the exact things that made me not want to tell him were the things that were hiding the thing that he was which we had in common.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 他听到你这么说，反应如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: I mean how did he react when you said that?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 他说**“真的吗？”** 我的心真的...是的。我想他当时是说，**“等等，你为什么没告诉我？”** 我当时想，这背后有很多原因，是你和我们关系中的很多事情，让我没有告诉你这些。而且，现在和你谈论这些感觉很不可思议，因为我们以前从未有过这样的交流模式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: He said really and oh my heart is really Yeah. And I think he was like, "Wait, why didn't you tell me?" And I was like, I that there's so much underneath that of, well, so many things about you and our relationship made it so that I wasn't telling you that stuff. And actually, it feels crazy to talk to you about this cuz this is not the mode we've ever been in before.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 他就像在说，**“嘿，拜托，你为什么把那个秘密藏了这么久？”** 而你就像在说，**“爸！”** 对，就是这样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: He's like, "Hey, come on. Why were you holding that secret in for so long?" You're like, "Dad." Right. Exactly.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 像这样的电话，我很好奇你们怎么知道何时结束。我是说，你的思绪肯定在飞速运转，身体感觉像是脱离了。你如何知道何时挂断电话，然后说，**“好吧，我爱你。”** 像这样的对话，你们是如何结束的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: With a phone call like this, I'm curious how you know when it's done. I mean, I'm sure there's your mind is racing. Your body feels disembodied. How do you know when to hang up and say, "Okay, I I love you." Like, what what's the how do you end something like that?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 我觉得我们当时要么可以一直聊下去，要么随时都可以结束，因为我们刚刚在关系中打开了一个巨大的、未曾探索的**“洞穴”**。而这第一个电话只是触及了表面。我不知道，我们是应该一辈子都待在电话里，讨论所有从未谈论过的事情，还是现在是说再见、说我爱你，然后约定下次什么时候再打电话、见面，真正继续讨论这一切的好时机？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: I felt like there we could either have talked infinity or been over at any point because this was we just opened up this huge cavern of unexplored territory in our relationship. And this one first phone call was just scratching it. And I didn't know, should we just stay on the phone for the rest of our lives and discuss all the things that we've never talked about or I guess now's a pretty good time for us to say goodbye, I love you, and when's the next time I'm going to call you and see you in person and actually really keep talking about what is this?

</details>

### 认知失调与童年印象

**Anna Martin**: 所以，你挂了电话。当你回到现实世界时，感觉如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: So, you hung up. How are you feeling when you sort of come back into the world?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 我当时想，**“我爸是同性恋。”** 我不得不一直大声说出来，真的是大声说。我大声说出来是因为这对我来说太不可思议了。我的大脑里有一部分是我父亲的形象，另一部分是同性恋的概念，这两部分完全不相连。所以我正努力让这些**“神经通路”**连接起来，但这太**“认知失调”**了。我爸是同性恋。我只是自言自语。我是说，对任何人来说，接到这样的电话都会很震惊。对你来说，这对于你所认识的父亲，那个把你养大的爸爸来说，似乎完全不可想象。你小时候，他是什么样的人？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: I am like, "My dad is gay." And I have to keep saying the words out loud, like literally out loud. I'm saying them out loud because it is so unfathomable to me. I have this whole part of my brain that where my dad lives and the part of my brain where there's gay, they're not connected at all. And so I'm quickly trying to like make the neural pathways connect, but it's not it's such cognitive dissonance. My dad is gay. I'm just muttering it to myself. I mean, for anyone, I think this would be a shocking call to get. For you specifically, this seems completely unfathomable for the man that you know as your father, the the the dad that raised you. What was he like when you were a kid, when you were growing up?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 他是一个非常温暖有爱的爸爸，工作很忙。所以我在工作日不怎么见到他。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: He was such a warm and loving dad who worked a lot. So I during the week didn't see him so much

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 他做什么工作？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: and what did he do?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 他拥有一家**物业管理公司**，经常开会到很晚，他还担任我们**犹太教堂**的会长。所以如果他没有工作会议，他就会在犹太教堂开会。但周末他会花时间陪我们做一些事情，比如骑自行车和去博物馆。他非常关心我。他想确保我完成了数学作业，早睡早起。他痴迷于我们早睡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: He owned a property management company and he had meetings often late and then also he served as our synagogue president. So if he didn't have meetings for work, he had meetings at the synagogue. But on the weekends he'd spend time with us doing things like riding bikes and going to museums. Um and he cared about me so much. He wanted to make sure I was getting my math homework done and sleeping, going to bed early. He's obsessed with us going to bed early.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 典型的爸爸行为。我当时就想，**“爸，爸，爸。”**

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Classic dad things. I'm like, "Dad, dad, dad."

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 哦，是的。出门前必须吃早餐。早餐必须包含蛋白质。工作非常努力，就是一个商人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: Oh yes. couldn't leave the house without eating breakfast. Breakfast had to include a protein. Working very hard, just a businessman.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Yeah.

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 如果你走进他的衣柜，就像卡通片里一样，一整排都是同样的衣服。都是西装，西装。他穿很多**米色**。他上身穿米色，下身也穿米色时，我就会很恼火。我会说，**“爸，你不能那样穿。”** 尽管我现在觉得米色配米色很时尚，但当时我爸那样穿，一点也不时尚。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: If you go into his closet, it's like those cartoons where they have the same outfit the whole rack long. It's like suit suit. And he wore a lot of beige. And I would get annoyed when he'd wear beige on top, beige on bottom. I'd say, "Dad, you can't do that." Even though I think now that's trendy to wear beige on beige, but back then the way my dad was doing it, it was not trendy.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 你会说什么？说，**“爸，你不能穿那个。”**

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: What would you say? say, "Dad, you can't wear that."

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 他会怎么回答？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: And what would he say back?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 他会说，**“我就是这么穿的。我没想跟你一样酷。”** 他总是做需要做的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: He's like, "This is just what I wear. I'm not trying to look cool like you." He always did what was needed to be done.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 他做了别人需要他做的事情。所以，他实际上曾是一名**建筑师**，后来转行做物业管理，因为他想赚更多的钱来养家。他放弃了建筑师的工作，因为他想要一份更稳定的工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: He did what was what other people needed from him. So, he he actually he was an architect and he switched to property management because he wanted to make more money to support his family. So he gave that up because he wanted to have a more reliable job.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 你小时候知道这些吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Did you know that when you were a kid?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 我总是感到难过，因为他现在的工作似乎并不快乐，而且他工作时间很长。但这总是为了我们赚钱。然后是犹太教堂，他总是工作那么多，根本没有时间。但后来犹太教堂需要一位会长，他们请了他，他就答应了。他总是做那些需要做的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: And I always felt sad because his current job seemed to not make him happy and he worked such long hours. But it was always because he was making money for us. And then the synagogue, he always he worked so much. He didn't have any time. But then the synagogue needed a president and they asked him and he said yes. And he was just always doing what was needed.

</details>

### 父女关系的界限

**Anna Martin**: 你觉得你爸爸理解你吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Did you feel like your dad understood you?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 我想我曾认为爸爸是爱你、照顾你的人，但我没觉得爸爸应该像朋友那样了解你。所以，我想他...他甚至在我开口之前就满足了我所有的物质需求，甚至超出了我的需要，比如想让我比实际需要更早睡觉。这就是爸爸的职责。爸爸不是为了真正深入了解你而存在的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: I think I thought of dads as people who loved you and took care of you, but I didn't think of a dad as someone who's supposed to like know you like a friend did. So, I think he the fact that he took care of all my material needs before I even asked, even more than I needed, like wanting me to go to bed earlier than I needed to go to bed. That's what dads were for. Dads didn't weren't there to really understand you so deeply.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 我理解这种区别，你很受爱，但这并不是一种可以倾诉的关系。听起来你们的角色设定得很明确，对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: M I I I I understand this distinction and it's not you were very loved, but this is um this is not like a confiding relationship. It's like your roles are quite set, it sounds, right?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 是的。他是爸爸。他养家糊口。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: Yep. He's the dad. He provides for the family

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 我是女儿，我找其他人倾诉我的感受。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: and I'm the daughter and I find other people to talk about how I'm feeling with.

</details>

### 茱莉亚的自我发现之旅

**Anna Martin**: 嗯。我还在想，你告诉我，你意识到自己可能被女性吸引，那是在家里的时候就开始了吗？或者你是什么时候意识到这一点的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Yeah. I also wonder and I mean you you tell me but realizing that you were maybe attracted to women like did that start when you were at home or when was your sort of realization of that?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 这是一个非常缓慢而漫长的过程。我高中时在和一个男生约会，我记得当时想，甚至告诉他，**“哦，我也被女生吸引，但我认为所有女生都会被其他女生吸引。”** 他当时就是那样。是的。然后他说，**“哦，好吧，我不会被其他男生吸引，但酷。”** 我当时仍然认为自己是**异性恋**，觉得那只是很正常的事情。我没有质疑。我认为整个社会都在灌输女性要和男生约会。而我能做到这一点，让我完全没有停下来思考。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: It was a really slow long realization. So I was dating a guy in high school and I remember thinking and even telling him like oh I'm also attracted to girls but I think all girls are attracted to other girls and he was like that. Yeah. Yeah. And he was like oh well I'm not attracted to other guys but cool. And I still just thought I was straight and that that was just a normal thing. I didn't question it. I think all of society sears you if you're a woman to date guys. And the fact that I could made me not pause at all.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 你去了大学，那通常是自我发现的时期，也是性取向自我发现的时期。你在大学里发现了自己什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: You know, you head off to college, which is classically a time of self-discovery and also sexual self-discovery. What were you discovering about yourself at college?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 首先，我意识到生活有这么多不同的方式。我周围都是那些公开出柜的**酷儿**，他们对自己的身份非常自信，我以前从未见过这样的情况。每个人都在那里约会、谈论，我感觉自己像一只**“受惊的鹿”**，**“哇，发生了什么？我在哪里？”** 但同时，**“酷，我喜欢这个。”** 然后我开始和**凯莱布**约会，他住在我大一的宿舍里。我们相遇是因为我在地下室休息室做美术作业，他只是坐在我旁边，开始用蜡笔画画，我们就开始聊天了。我们第一次约会时，我记得我需要在美术楼做美术作业，当时我完全失声了。所以凯莱布问他是否可以来，我示意说，**“是的，当然，但我几乎不能说话。”** 他来了。说话很痛苦，但我们就是停不下来。我们一直在聊。我一直说，**“我不能再说了。我快失声了。我真的不能。这太痛苦了。”** 但我们就是一直聊啊聊。那真的让我意识到，**“哦，他真的是我的那个人。”**

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: First, I was realizing that there were so many ways to be. I was just surrounded by all these out queer people who were so confident in who they were, and I had never seen anything like it. And everyone is just so out there hooking up, talking about it, and it I felt like a deer in headlights, like, whoa, what is happening? Where am I? And also, cool, love this. Um, then I started dating **Caleb** who's in my freshman dorm and we meet cuz I'm doing my art homework in the basement lounge and he just sits down next to me and he starts drawing with the pastels and we start talking. Um, one of our first dates, I remember I need to do my art homework at the art building and I had totally lost my voice. So, Caleb asked if he could come and I communicated like, "Yeah, sure, but I can barely talk." And he came. Talking is so painful, but we just can't stop. We're just talking and talking. And I keep saying, "I can't keep talking. My I'm losing my voice. I really I can't. This is so painful." But then we just talk and talk and talk. And that really made me realize like, "Oh, he's really a person for me."

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 爱是会痛的，伙计。爱有时真的会带来身体上的痛苦。所以，你在大学剩下的时间里都在和**凯莱布**约会，但在背景中，你也在发现并加深对自己的理解，即你也被女性吸引，对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Love hurts, man. Love actually physically hurts sometimes. So, it's during you're dating you're dating Caleb for the rest of college, but in the background you're discovering and sort of deepening your understanding of yourself as someone who is attracted to women as well, right?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 但我认为，我感觉很奇怪，不应该在这件事上占用太多空间，因为我...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: But I think I feel weird about taking up so much space about it because I

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 因为你处于一段看起来像**异性恋**的关系中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: because you're in a straight presenting relationship.

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 是的，没错。我当时想象着其他人看着我，会想，**“她正在和一个男生约会。她为什么要谈论自己是双性恋？她真的是双性恋吗？她是不是只是为了赶时髦？”**

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: Yeah, exactly. I'm imagining everyone else looking at me like, she's dating a guy. Why would she need to talk about being by and and is she really by? Is she just doing it to be trendy?

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 大学毕业时，你是否向自己或亲近的人认定自己是**双性恋**？那是一个你可以大声说出来的身份吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: At the end of school, were you identifying to yourself or to your close people as bisexual? Was that something you could claim out loud?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 所以，我实际上是向自己和一些人认定我是双性恋，但我实际上还没有告诉**凯莱布**我认定自己是双性恋。他知道我被女性吸引，也和女性有过亲密关系，但我没有明确地承认这一点。实际上，我告诉他的那一刻，如果我跳到几年后，大学毕业后，我们正在约会，我们住在一起，我们正在叠衣服，他突然说，**“茱莉亚，我们必须在我的祖父母去世前结婚。”** 而我回应的是，**“我是双性恋。”** 因为我第一个感觉是，**“天哪，他想结婚。”** 而我是双性恋，我还没有真正告诉他。实际上，我现在不知道我想走哪条路，因为如果我们结婚，我觉得我面临两条路的抉择。一条是和一个男人过着**异性恋规范**的传统生活，另一条是和一个女人。我不知道这是否等同于，比如说我只是一个异性恋，在A男和B男之间做选择，还是这实际上是我必须做出的一个更根本的选择。但我还没有真正地...我有点把它搁置了。我还没有真正处理过它。我有点随波逐流。但当他说我们应该结婚，你知道，为了我的祖父母，这件事情就浮出水面了，因为这种感觉一直潜藏在你内心深处，你觉得自己可能没有尊重自己的一部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: So, I actually I was identifying to myself and to some people, but I actually hadn't told **Caleb** that I identified as by. He knew I was attracted to women and that I'd hooked up with women, but I hadn't owned that explicitly. Um, and actually the moment I told him was, if I jump forward, a few years after college, we're dating, we move in together, we're folding laundry, and out of nowhere, he says, "Julia, we need to get married before my grandparents die." And the thing I respond with is, "I'm bisexual." And because that's the my first feeling is, "Oh my god, he wants to get married." and I'm by I haven't really told him that. And actually now I don't know what road I'm want to go down because if we get married I felt like I had a choice between two roads. One was with a man living a heteronormative conventional life and the other road was with a woman. And I didn't know was this equivalent to let's say I was just straight deciding between man A and man B or was this actually a more fundamental choice I had to make. But I hadn't really I kind of put that on the back burner. I hadn't really grappled with it. I was kind of coasting. But then when he said we should we got to get married, you know, for my grandparents, this is what surfaced because this had been sort of latent underneath the surface for you, this feeling like you maybe weren't honoring a part of yourself.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 没错。他对此有什么回应？**“我们结婚吧，在我的祖父母去世之前。”** **“我是双性恋。”**

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Exactly. And and what what did he say back to that? Let's get married before my grandparents, you know, die. I'm bisexual.

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 哦，好吧。然后他就像，**“哦，你想对此做些什么吗？”** 我当时想，我需要暂停这场关于婚姻的对话。那是我需要的。嗯。然后我做了很多**“灵魂拷问”**，思考这到底意味着什么？和一个女人在一起和和一个男人在一起有什么区别？当然，一个巨大的区别是世界如何看待你，但对我来说这意味着什么？因为我还是同一个人。两种情况下都是我，但一种生活会与另一种生活非常不同，这种不同不仅仅是嫁给一个人和嫁给另一个人之间的区别，这是真的吗？比如，嫁给一个男人和嫁给一个女人意味着什么？我真的认为这是一个我必须选择的**“二元对立”**。我感到非常困惑，不知道如何做出这个决定。我无法暂停我的生活，去认真地长期约会一个女人，然后把它和与**凯莱布**的生活进行比较。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: Oh, okay. And like, oh, do you want to do something about that? And I was like, I need to just pause this conversation about marriage. That's the thing I need. Huh. And so then I did a lot of soulsearching about what does it actually mean? What is the difference between being with a woman and being with a man? So of course a huge difference is how the world perceives you, but what would it mean for me? Because I would be the same person. It's still me in both cases, but is it true that one life would be very different from the other in a way that's different from just having married one person versus another person? Like what does it mean to marry a man versus to marry a woman? And I really thought it was a binary that I had to choose between. And I felt really stuck and I didn't know how to make that decision. And I I couldn't pause my life to go try seriously dating a woman long term and then compare it to my life with Caleb.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 当然。是的。你不可能那样做，对吧？就像，**“凯莱布，你能等一下吗？我要去探索我自己的另一面。我爱你。再见。”** 你不能那样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Of course. Right. Yeah. How could you do that? Like, K, can you go wait as I explore this other side of myself? I love you. Bye-bye. You can't do that.

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 然后就在这种**“决策瘫痪”**中，我接到了我父亲的电话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: And then in the middle of this decision paralysis is when I get the phone call

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 你父亲的电话，告诉你他是双性恋。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: from your father. from my father telling you that he's by

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 是的。天哪。一方面，这似乎证实了我最大的恐惧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: Yes. Oh my gosh. And it on one hand seemed to confirm my biggest fears.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Huh.

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 那就是如果我选择了这种与异性在一起的传统生活，我的**双性恋**身份就没有空间了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: Which is that if I picked this conventional life with the opposite sex that there would be no room for my bisexuality.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 你就会变得像你爸爸一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: You turn out like your dad

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 我就会变得像我爸爸一样，而且行不通。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: and I turn out like my dad and it wouldn't work.

</details>

### 父女的共同困境与疑问

**Anna Martin**: 可以说，这有很多事情要处理。你正在努力解决结婚意味着什么，这对你的身份意味着什么，如果你正在放弃自己的一部分，如果那不是真实的你。而在这极度困惑之中，你接到了你父亲的电话，基本上揭示了你根本不了解他。好吧。然后你怎么办？你的头脑肯定在飞速旋转。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Let's just say that's a lot to deal with. You are grappling with what it means to get married, what that means for your identity, if you're forsaking, you know, a a part of you, if that's not true to you. And in the middle of being very confused about this, you get a call from your father that basically reveals you don't know him at all. Okay. And then you just what I mean what do you do? Your your head must have been spinning.

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 完全是。我当时想，**“好吧，我需要知道关于我爸爸和他的一切细节，因为我想我可能会变得像他一样，我想知道这是否可以避免，他是如何走到这一步的？这和我一样吗？他到底是谁？这个我以为我认识但实际上不认识的人。”**

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: Totally. I was like, "Okay, I need to know every single detail about my dad and who he is because I think I'm going to turn out like him and I want to know is that avoidable and how did he get to be in this place? And is it the same as me? And who is he even? This person who I thought I knew but turns out I don't."

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 请稍候。我想回到你之前说过的一点，你害怕变成你父亲那样。你是否也害怕你的婚姻，未来的婚姻会变得像你爸爸妈妈的婚姻一样？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Stay with us. I want to return to something you said which is you were afraid of becoming your father. Were you also afraid of your marriage, a potential marriage becoming like the marriage between your dad and your mom?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: **百分之百**。我想当我担心是选择嫁给一个男人还是嫁给一个女人的生活时，我感觉如果我选择任何一条路，是否意味着必须放弃、隐藏或压抑自己的一部分？那是否会因此导致我无法完全投入这段关系，并最终以你所目睹的父母婚姻破裂的方式走向**“爆炸”**？是的，这证实了我一直告诉自己会发生的故事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: 100%. I think when I was worried about should I choose this life of marrying a man versus marrying a woman, I felt like if I choose either path, does that mean having to give up or hide or silence a chunk of myself? And will that therefore lead me to not being able to be fully in this relationship and for it to combust somehow down the line in the way that you were witnessing your parents' marriage combust? Yes, it proved the story I had been telling myself would happen.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 出于所有这些原因，这些我们正在谈论的层层叠叠的原因，你对你父亲有更多的问题。那么，你做了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: You have so many more questions for your father for all of these reasons, these layered reasons that we're talking about. So, what do you do? Another phone call.

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 又打了个电话。我飞回**芝加哥**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: I fly home to Chicago.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 这很有道理。这些对话可能应该当面进行。好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: That makes a lot of sense. These conversations should probably happen in person. Okay.

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 我找到我爸爸，我真的说，**“爸，我们需要进行一次‘同性恋谈话’。”**

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: And I find my dad and I literally say, "Dad, we need to have a gay talk." So, I

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 等等，你真的那么说了吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Wait, did you really say that?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 真的，我们需要进行一次**“同性恋谈话”**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: Literally, we need to have a gay talk.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 如果那样说呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: What if you say that?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 他就像，**“好的。”** 所以我们去坐在门廊的秋千上，我们前后摇晃，我进入了**“检察官模式”**。所以，你是什么时候意识到自己是双性恋的？你为什么决定结婚？你的朋友们怎么看？你什么时候感到后悔？你什么时候意识到自己内心**“死气沉沉”**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: He's like, "Okay." So, we go sit on the porch swing and we're rocking back and forth and I'm like in prosecutor mode. So, when did you realize you were by and why did you decide to get married? And what did your friends think? And when did did you have regret? And when did you realize you felt dead inside?

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 你问他这些了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: You asked him that.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 当你问他什么时候意识到自己是同性恋时，他和你分享了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: When you were like when did you realize you were gay? What did he share with you?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 他说，**“我一直都知道。”**

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: He said, "I always knew."

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 他曾和男人女人都约会过，当他约会另一方时，双方都会产生怀疑。当他决定和女人结婚时，他失去了一些朋友。他搬到了郊区，他的一些**同性恋朋友**，他说，**“不再和他说话了。”** 也许不是因为他们反对他所做的事情，而只是他们渐渐疏远了。他们生活在不同的世界，但他想要一个家庭，这就是他想要的。他说他拥有最棒的关系、婚姻和家庭，那就是他想要的，直到它不再是。他重申的主要一点是，多年来我感到非常幸福，这就是我想要的关系和家庭，然后最近这种感觉一直在内心积聚，但他无法确切告诉我何时或具体是什么，有太多**“我不知道”**，超出了我能承受的范围。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: And he dated men and women and both were suspicious when he dated the other. And when he decided to marry women, he lost some friends. He moved out to the suburbs, and some of his gay friends, he said, "Stop talking to him." Not maybe because they were taking a stand against what he did, but just they kind of fell out. They were in different worlds, but he wanted to have a family, and this is what he wanted. and he said he had the most amazing relationship and marriage and family and it was what he wanted until it wasn't. The main thing he reiterated was I for so many years I felt so happy and this was the relationship I wanted and the family I wanted and then recently this has been building up inside but he couldn't tell me exactly when or exactly what and there was more I don't knows than I could handle.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 你对那个问题的答案满意吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Did you feel satisfied at the end of that question?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 绝对不满意。每次他说**“我不知道”**，我都会尝试用不同的方式提问。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: Definitely not. I every time he said I don't know I would just try and ask the question in a different way.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 你问他接下来会怎样了吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Did you ask him like where do we go from here?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 是的，我问他接下来会怎样，他说他想一个人待一段时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: Yes, I asked him that what's next for him and he said I want to be alone for a while.

</details>

### 婚姻、身份与自我整合

**Anna Martin**: 我们谈论了你如何通过提问来了解你父亲，但你当时也正处于对自己生活、身份以及是否想结婚的强烈困惑之中。我好奇，在**伊利诺伊州**与父亲进行这些对话后，你总有一天要飞回家，对吧？但我猜你继续交谈，继续了解更多。那感觉如何？你从父亲那里学到的东西如何影响你对自身处境的思考？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: You know, we talked about how you were asking these questions to get to know your dad, but you were also in the middle of intense confusion about your own life, your own identity, and whether you wanted to get married. I wonder having these conversations with your dad in Illinois, at some point you will have to fly home, right? But I I assume you continue to talk, continue to learn more. How was that? How was what you were learning about your father influencing how you were thinking about your own situation?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 我曾认为结婚是一个**“二元选择”**。你可以嫁给一个男人过传统生活，或者嫁给一个女人过**酷儿生活**。而我从我爸爸身上意识到的是，问题不在于处于一段看似异性恋的关系中。问题在于没有成为完整的自己。问题在于不得不隐藏自己的一部分，这在任何类型的关系中都可能发生。如果你不得不隐藏自己的一部分，无法完全展现真实的自己，那么这就会付出**“代价”**，因为它会渗透到你身体的其他部分。如果你觉得必须隐藏某些东西，你想要的得不到允许，你的一部分不被接受，那么你可能会试图淡化自己的其他部分。我认为这就是我爸爸付出代价的原因。而这不一定是必然的。在任何关系中，你都必须努力确保你完整的自我被展现出来，被接受和被爱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: I thought of getting married as a binary. You could marry a man and have a conventional life or marry a woman and have a queer life. And what I realized from seeing my dad was that it's not being in a straight passing relationship that's the problem. It's not being your full self is the problem. Is having to tuck away a part of you, which you can do in any type of relationship. If you have to tuck away a part of yourself and you can't fully be it, then it has takes a cost because it can seep into other parts of you. If you feel like you have to hide something and that what you want isn't allowed, a part of you isn't accepted, then you might try to downplay other parts of yourself. And I think that is what took the toll for my dad. And that that doesn't have to be how it is. that in any relationship you have to work to make sure you your full self is out there and accepted and loved.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 对你爸爸来说，他隐藏了自己的一部分，你说这付出了**“代价”**。尽管我理解，但请告诉我更多关于这种代价。我们谈论的是对他的代价。对他的关系有什么代价？从你的角度来看，对你和他的关系有什么代价？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: For your dad, he was hiding this part of himself and you're saying it took a toll. Tell me more about that toll even though I understand. I want to What was the toll on We're talking about the toll on him. What was the toll on his relationships? What was the toll from your point of view? What was the toll on his relationship with you?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 我觉得他没有花时间去感受自己的情绪，因为他没有时间。他有点把它**“装进了盒子里”**。因为他没有真正思考自己的感受，他就会分心，真正专注于更物质的东西，比如按时睡觉、吃早餐，那些更容易谈论的事情。但你真正的感受，是他不想触及的地方。然后这让我也很难分享我真正的感受，因为我认为孩子们是在被**“模仿”**中学会谈论这些事情的，当然。而我没有真正从我爸爸那里看到这种模仿。所以我们从未有过那样的交流。结果，我最终向他隐瞒了很多事情，包括我也是**双性恋**这个巨大的事实。这真是件疯狂的事，我们都秘密地藏着这些信息，然后我们建立了一个**“假象”**，彼此不交流。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: I feel like he didn't spend time accessing how he was feeling because he didn't have time for it. He kind of put it in a box. And because he wasn't really thinking about how he was feeling, he was he distract really focus on more material things like going to bed on time, eating breakfast, things that were easier to talk about. but how you were really doing was a place he didn't want to go. And then it made it hard for me to want to share how I'm really doing because I think kids learn to talk about that stuff when it's modeled to them, of course. And I didn't really see it modeled from my dad. And so we never got to talk like that. And as a result, I ended up withholding a lot of stuff from him, including the huge fact that I too was bisexual. this crazy thing that we're both secretly holding these pieces of information and we built up this artifice where we're not talking to each other.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 嗯，这让你们疏远了。你甚至没有意识到，但它阻止了你们亲近。现在你们都分享了作为双性恋、作为酷儿的身份。这让你们更亲近了吗？你觉得是这样吗？你觉得...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Um, it pushed you apart. You weren't even aware of it, but it it prevented you from from closeness right now that you share this thing being by being queer. Did that bring you closer together? Did you feel like you were Yeah. Did you feel

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 是的。我想我爸爸出柜后，他开始告诉我更多关于他自己的事情。他谈论他的朋友。我才真正了解他的朋友是谁。以前他主要是和我父母的朋友的丈夫、我妈妈的朋友、异性恋者、犹太教堂里的人做朋友，都是很好的人。但他没有多少自己的朋友。他开始结交新朋友，他加入了一个**“同性恋爸爸支持小组”**。哇。他在那个支持小组里交了很多朋友，他的社交生活真的**“绽放”**了。他比我玩得还开心。他比我更频繁地出去玩。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: Yeah. I think once my dad came out, he started telling me much more about himself. He talked about his friends. I got to actually understand who his friends were. Before he really was mostly friends with like the husbands, sure, of my parents, my mom's friends, straight people, the people at synagogue, like lovely, lovely people. But he didn't have many of his own friends. And he started forming new friends for he joined a support group for gay dads. Wow. and he made a lot of friends in that support group and he actually his social life really blossomed. Like he he has more fun than I do. He's he goes out on the town like much more frequently than I am.

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 他会以一种我们以前从未有过的方式告诉我这些。我想通过了解他的朋友，我才意识到，**“哦，我爸爸也可以有朋友。”** 我以前从没觉得爸爸会有朋友。突然间，关于我爸爸的整个世界都向我敞开了。所以他搬到了**芝加哥**的一套公寓里，这也是我通过看到他的新公寓而更多地了解他的另一个阶段。我第一次看到了他的**“审美”**，结果发现他的审美很棒。很漂亮，很现代。有很多**橙色**，比如橙色的椅子。我当时很震惊。不是米色，是橙色。哦，橙色。是的。鲜亮的橙色。为什么是橙色？他说，**“我喜欢橙色。”** 我当时想，**“爸，什么？这个人是谁？”** 实际上，我把他的公寓作为另一种方式来更多地了解他。他出柜了，而我则在他的衣柜里，试图弄清楚这个人是谁。你之前提到过他的西装。哦，现在完全不同了。我在他的袜子抽屉里看到了带有疯狂图案的**荧光袜**。我看到他仍然有他的正装衬衫，但它们被压在一边，取而代之的是各种**热带短袖**。然后我们和他视频通话时，他穿着一件鲜亮的**橙色背心**。我当时想，**“天哪，这个爸爸是谁？”** 我截了个图，**“另一个人是谁？”** 他看起来很棒。他很健壮，穿着这件背心。我以前从未见过他穿那样的衣服。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: And he would tell me about it in a way that that's not how we used to talk. And I think by learning about his friends, I was like, "Oh, my dad can have friends." I didn't think of dads as people who had friends. And all of a sudden, I was this whole world about who my dad was was opening up. So he moves into an apartment in Chicago and this is also another phase where I learn a lot about him by seeing this new apartment of his. It's for the first time I see his aesthetic and turns out he has great aesthetic. It's beautiful. It's modern. Lots of orange like orange chairs. I was shocked. And um not beige orange. Oh orange. Yes. Bright bright orange. Why orange? He said I like orange. I was like, "Dad, what? Who is this person?" And I actually I use his apartment as another way to learn more about him. He's out of the closet and I'm inside his closet trying to figure out who is this person and and you mentioned the suit suit before. Oh, and it's totally different now. I see in his sock drawer neon socks with crazy patterns on it. And I see he still has his dress shirts, but they're squashed over and there's all these tropical short sleeves. Then we'll be facetiming him and he's comes out in this bright orange muscle tea. I'm like, "Oh my god, who is this dad taking a screenshot like, who is this person on the other?" He looked great. He was swole and he's rocking this muscle tea. I've never seen him in anything like that.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 你有没有说类似**“爸爸的背心”**之类的话？还是没有？你只是继续下去。我们很难直接说出眼前正在发生的事情，那就是他正在我们眼前完全**“蜕变”**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Did you say something like dad muscle tea or no? You just kind of kept it pushing. It was it was hard for us to just name the thing that was happening in front of us which is that he is totally transforming in front of our eyes.

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 我...我不知道，和他谈论这件事感觉很奇怪，因为他仍然...即使我试图直接谈论，他也会有点像，**“哦，你什么意思？我不知道。”** 他仍然不...你就像，**“不。”** 是的，没错，他仍然不太舒服谈论摆在我们面前的如此明显的事情。那么在情感方面呢？他有什么变化？你能感觉到什么吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: I I couldn't I don't know I it felt weird to talk to him about it because he was still even if I would try to go directly there he would kind of be like oh what do you mean I don't know he was still not wore this shirt you're like no yeah exactly like he couldn't he wasn't so comfortable still talking about the thing that was so blatantly in front of us. What about sort of like emotionally? What was changing with him? Could you sense anything there?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 他会笑，而且很有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: He laughed and was funny. And

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 那是新的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: was that new?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: Yeah.

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 他...我是说，我还要说，与此同时，伴随而来的是家庭**“分裂”**的深切悲痛。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: And he I mean there was I should also say like parallel to this is a deep grief of the family splintering.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 当然。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Of course.

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 这只是由此产生的众多线索中的另一条。但他也很幽默，轻松愉快，他有点爱玩，他想玩得开心。他做了很多有趣的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: This is just another thread of the many threads that emerge from this. but he also is funny and light-hearted and he he's kind of playful and he's wants to have fun. He's doing a lot of fun things.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 你们会一起做那些有趣的事情吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Would you guys do those fun things together?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 是的，我们去了一家**变装酒吧**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: Yeah, we went to a drag bar.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 那是什么感觉？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: What was that like?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 那...我是说，我脑子里仍然有个小声音在说，**“我爸是同性恋。我爸是同性恋。”** 就像我跟我爸在变装酒吧。很奇怪。就像它无法理解，但它正在发生，所以我顺其自然。那是什么感觉？我爸只要喝一杯，他就会从**“爸爸模式”**切换到**“同性恋模式”**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: That was I mean again I still that little voice in my head like my dad is gay. My dad is gay. Like I'm at a drag bar with my dad. Weird. Like it's not computing but it's happening so I'm rolling with it. M what was that like? So once my dad has one drink, he switches from dad mode to gay mode.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 那是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: What does that mean?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 他开始和服务员调情。他开始告诉我关于**“约炮”**的事情，我当时就想，天哪。不，太多了。太多了，太多了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: He starts flirting with the waiter. He starts telling me about hookups and I'm like dead. No, too much. Too much too much.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 那与你之前告诉我的那个男人相去甚远。所以，他似乎切换到了这种**“游戏模式”**，然后他会切换回**“爸爸模式”**吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: That is that is that is so far from the man you told me about before. So, it seems like there's he's switching into this like game mode and then does he switch back to the dad mode?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 哦，是的。就像我们一离开酒吧，就又回到了**“爸爸模式”**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: Oh, yeah. Like the moment we leave the bar, it's back to dad mode.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Huh.

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 就像我觉得灯光、身处那个空间以及喝一杯酒，会让他切换。但当明亮的灯光重新亮起时，他就会说，**“哦，我是爸爸。”**

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: It's like I think the lighting and being in that space and having a drink kind of switches him. But then when the bright lights come back on, he's like, "Oh, I'm dad."

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 这对你来说很难应对吗？我是说，这是一个很大的情境转变。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Is that difficult for you to navigate? I mean, that's a big context shift.

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 是的，因为当他处于**“爸爸模式”**时，我仍然有很多关于同性恋的问题，我试图打探，而他可能非常不愿意谈论。但随着时间的推移，我看到他正在融合这两种身份。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: Yeah, because when he's in dad mode, I still have all these gay questions and I'm trying to pry and you can be really reluctant to talking about it. But over time, I've seen him merge these two identities.

</details>

### 整合身份：走向真诚的婚姻

**Anna Martin**: 我们马上回来。在这段时间里，你还在努力弄清楚结婚是不是你想做的事情吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: We'll be right back. In this time, were you still trying to figure out if getting married was something you wanted to do?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 我越了解我爸爸，我就越清楚地意识到，我绝对想和**凯莱布**结婚。而且我不是我爸爸。我越是看到他是什么样的人，以及我与**“爸爸模式”**是多么分离，我就越明白，哦，如果你把这些东西分开，那就会伤害你。如果你能整合自己，成为完整的自己，那才是关系中最重要的。你和谁在一起并不重要，是和男人在一起还是和女人在一起，你都可以在任何一种关系中成为**酷儿**。如果你采取我以前的态度，就是，哦，我正在和一个男人约会，那么谈论自己是双性恋有什么意义呢？这实际上是有问题的，因为那不是真实的你。也许这感觉不是什么大问题，但随着时间的推移，它可能会累积起来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: The more I got to know my dad, the clearer it became to me that I definitely wanted to get married to Caleb. And I was not my dad. And the more I saw who he was and how separate I was from dad mode, I saw like, oh, if you keep those things separate, that is what hurts you. And if you can integrate yourself and be your full self, that's the thing that matters in a relationship. It doesn't matter who you're with, being with a man or being with a woman, um you can be queer in either relationship. And if you take the stance I had taken before, which is like, oh, I'm dating a man, so what's the point of talking about being by? There's actually a problem with that, which is that that isn't who you are. And maybe it doesn't feel like a big deal, but maybe over time it can add up.

**Julia Staler**: 我越是看到我爸爸有多么不同，我就越意识到他隐藏了多少，而问题在于**“隐藏”**。问题不在于他最终和谁在一起。将**“隐藏”**识别为问题，让你意识到你想嫁给**凯莱布**，因为你可以和他在一起时做完整的自己，对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: The more I saw how different my dad was, the more I realized how much he had been hiding and that the problem was the hiding. The problem wasn't who he ended up with. Identifying that as the problem made you realize you wanted to marry Caleb because you could be your full self with him, right?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 凯莱布没有让我觉得我需要隐藏任何东西。不仅是我的性取向，还有我所有的其他部分，我凌乱的自我，任何东西。我不断发展、变化的自我，如果我有什么改变，我仍然可以向他展示那一部分。而且他也可以对我这样做。而且我们的关系掌握在我们自己手中，可以按照我们想要的方式去创造。它不必遵循剧本。我们掌控着一切。如果我们这样安排，我们就可以真正有意识地思考我们想要什么，并把它弄清楚，而不是觉得我们必须做别人期望我们做的事情，那么我们就可以把它变成我们想要的样子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: Caleb didn't make me feel like I needed to hide anything. Not just the parts of my sexuality, but all the other parts of myself, my messy self, anything. My evolving, changing self, that if something about me were to change, I could still reveal that part to him. And that he could do the same with me. And that also that our relationship was in our own hands to make it as we wanted. That it didn't have to fall to a script. That we were in control. And that if we set it up so that we could really intentionally think about what we wanted and make it really clear and not feel like we had to do what was expected of us, then we could make it what we wanted.

### 打破传统：茱莉亚的求婚

**Julia Staler**: 嗯，举个例子，这虽然是个小事，但我最终向**凯莱布**求婚了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: Um, like one example, this is a small one, but I ended up proposing to Caleb.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 天哪。告诉我那个故事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Oh my god. Tell me the story of that.

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 嗯，我们一起决定应该由我来做，因为我最初对结婚更犹豫。我认为，最初更犹豫的人应该做出这个**“盛大姿态”**，这很合理。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: Which well, we decided together that I should be the one to do it because I was the one who was more reluctant to getting married. And I think it makes sense that the person who's more reluctant initially should be the one to make the grand gesture.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 当然。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Sure.

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 所以我策划了这个盛大姿态。我们回到了我们相遇的大学宿舍，我为他做了一个**“解剖学心脏”**。我把它焊接起来，当我单膝跪地，把它交给他时，我说，**“有很多事情我不确定，但你是我最确定的事情之一。”** 这只是一个小例子，但对我来说，这可不小。你焊接了一颗心，然后向你生命中的挚爱求婚。对我来说，那可不小，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: So I made the planned the big grand gesture. We went back to our college dorm where we met and I made him a anatomical heart. I welded it and when I got down on one knee and I gave it to him and I said like there's so many things I'm not sure about but you're one of the things I feel the most sure about. And that's a small example but that's actually not small to me. You welded a damn heart and you proposed to the love of your life. That's not so small to me,

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 小在于，我们没有遵循**“性别期望”**，当然，但总的来说，我们把每个决定都看作是我们两个人想做什么。我认为在我周围的每段健康关系中，无论性取向如何，我看到人们都在这样做：我们是两个人。我们每个人想要什么？我们每个人需要什么？让我们自己做出这些决定，而不是以外界对我们的期望为中心。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: right? Small in that like by doing what wasn't the gendered expectation, of course, but just in general seeing every decision as what do we as two human beings want to do. And I think in every healthy relationship around me, no matter the sexuality, that's what I see people doing is we're two humans. What do we each want? What do we each need? Let's make these decisions for oursel and not center what the outside world is going to expect from us looking in.

</details>

### 家庭重组与未来展望

**Anna Martin**: 你用这个精美的焊接心脏求婚了。在你的婚礼上，你父母都在场吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: You proposed with this wonderful welded heart at your wedding. Were both your parents there?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 是的，他们分别挽着我的手臂走过红毯。我想我当时很担心那一刻，但实际上，如果你分别挽着他们的手臂，他们都在那里支持你，但他们不必互相交流。所以，这是一个完美的安排。有他们在身边感觉非常好，他们都在场，都很支持，而且没有真正互相交流。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: Yeah, we they walked down the aisle on either side. I think I was worried about that moment, but actually if you're hooking arms with them on either side, they are both there supporting you, but they're not having to interact with each other. So, it was a perfect setup. felt really great with them on my side and they were both there and supportive and not really not interacting with each other.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 他们中有人带伴侣来了吗？还是没有？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Did either one of them bring a date or no?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 他们当时都有男朋友，我们决定最简单的方法就是他们俩都不要带男朋友来。所以不允许带男朋友。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: They actually at that time both had boyfriends and we decided the simplest thing would be if neither of them brought their boyfriends. So no boyfriends allowed.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 我理解这个选择。这次不带男朋友。好的。有意思。我是说，我真心为你爸爸的**“绽放”**感到高兴。我觉得听起来就是这样。他穿着橙色衣服。他出门了。他与朋友和社区互动。他就像在很多方面重新找回了自己。但与此同时，正如你所说，你也在经历真正的**“悲伤”**和**“痛苦”**。我猜我想问你，这两种情绪非常不同，对吧？那种悲伤和看着你父亲的喜悦。这感觉像是**“忠诚分裂”**吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: I I understand that choice. No boyfriends at this. Okay. Interesting. I mean, I am genuinely happy to hear about your dad's blossoming. And I don't think that that's I think that that's what it sounds like. He's wearing his orange. He's going out. He's engaging with friends and community. He's like he's finding himself again in a lot of ways. But at the same time, as you said, you're also navigating this experience of of real grief and real pain. M and I guess I wonder for you, those are two very different emotions, right? The sort of grief of it and the joy of watching your father. Does it feel like split loyalties almost?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 完全是。我现在真的看到了他新生活的**“代价”**，它付出了什么，它让我的家庭付出了什么。我感到非常悲伤，我想知道这本可以避免吗？有办法吗？我认为那不是一个富有成效的思考方向。但想到所有这些痛苦是否必须发生，他才能感受到他现在的感受，这确实令人困惑。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: Totally. And I really see the price of his new life now, what it cost, what it cost my family. And I I feel so sad and I wonder how could this have been avoided? Was there a way? And I think that's not a productive place to go. But it is confusing to think like did all this pain have to happen for him to feel how he feels now?

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 那是一个大问题。我想你也知道，你说得对。你可能得不到答案。但我想说，虽然听起来老套，但却是真的。你正在通过在与**凯莱布**的婚姻中做完整真实的自己，并在很多方面阻止类似的事情发生，从而活出答案。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: That's a big question. And I think as you know, you're right. It you might not get an answer to that. But I would say cheesy but true. You're kind of living out an answer by being your full true self in your marriage with Caleb and preventing in a lot of ways something like that from happening.

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 我希望如此。我只能希望。但我认为我越是见到他，我就越感到被**“肯定”**，因为我以前，就像我说的，对谈论自己是双性恋感到犹豫，觉得，我为什么要占用这方面的空间？人们会认为我只是想赶时髦吗？而实际上，我知道对我来说，对**凯莱布**来说，这不应该是一个秘密，如果我不谈论它，如果我表现得像个异性恋，那不是真实的我，最终会付出代价的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: I hope so. I can only hope. But I think the more I see him, the more I feel affirmed cuz I used to, as I was saying, feel hesitant about talking about being by and feeling like, why should I take up space about this? And will people think I'm just trying to be trendy and that actually know that there's a reason for me and for Caleb for this not to be a secret that that if I don't talk about it, that if I act like I'm straight, that's not who I am, and that's going to end up having a cost.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 你发现你爸爸的这个秘密已经几年了。他现在在做什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: It's been a few years since you found this out about your dad. What's he up to now?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 他住在**棕榈泉**。天哪。他当然住在那里。他过着很棒的生活。他有一个男朋友，而且，就像我说的，他经常出去玩。我会在周六晚上给他打电话。我躺在沙发上，他却在和朋友们**“酒吧跳跃”**，玩得很开心。我想也有一些悲伤，因为我们作为一个家庭没有在一起。我妈妈在**芝加哥**，我们都**“分裂”**了，但我认为他选择了，既然已经分裂了，那我就搬到我想住的地方，和我喜欢的人在一起，玩得开心。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: He's living in Palm Springs. Oh my gosh. Of course he is. Having a great life. He has a boyfriend and he, as I said, he is out on the town. I'll call him from Saturday night. I'm on my couch and he's like bar hopping with his friends having fun. I think there's also the sadness that we're not all together as a family. My mom's in Chicago and we are all splintered, but I think he has chosen given the splintering that I'm going to move to the place I want to live and be with the person I want and have fun.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 你和**凯莱布**，你们有一个孩子。我知道。当你的孩子长大一点后，你会如何向他谈论你爸爸？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: You and Caleb, you have a kid. I know this. How will you talk to your kid about your dad when your kid gets a little older?

</details>

**Julia Staler**: 我是说，我希望我的孩子从出生那一刻起，就能感受到所有不同的存在方式都弥漫在他周围，做任何事情都不是什么大不了的事。而且这非常**“实事求是”**。是的。你的爷爷，他有一个男朋友。他以前和你奶奶在一起。你妈妈被男人和女人吸引。你爸爸只被女人吸引。你可以成为任何你想成为的人。我希望这真的很正常。也许当他长大后，我想可以谈论他爷爷生活中所经历的痛苦，以及那是他所处时代的产物，我希望我的孩子永远不必像我爸爸那样，在家庭和性取向之间做出选择。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Julia Staler**: I mean, one thing I want for my kid is that all the different ways of being are just in the air around him from the moment he's born that it's no big deal to be anything. And it's very matter of fact. Yep. Your grandpa, he has a boyfriend. He used to be with your grandma. Your mom is attracted to men and women. Your dad's just attracted to women. you get to be whatever you want. I want it to be really normal. And maybe when he's older, I guess talking about the pain that went into his grandpa's life and and how that was a function of the time that he was in and that I hope that my kid doesn't ever have to make a choice like my dad did about having to choose between his family and his sexuality.
