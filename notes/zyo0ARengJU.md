### 课程改革的呼唤

**主持人**: 回顾1995年，受人尊敬的**让·奥古斯丁**（Jean Augustine），第一位当选为国会议员的黑人女性，在众议院发表了一项相当直接的请求：承认二月为加拿大各地的黑人历史月。该动议获得一致通过，多年后她向TVO讲述了推动这一倡议的真正动力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Back in 1995, the honorable Jean Augustine, the first black woman elected to Parliament, stood up in the House of Commons and made a pretty straightforward request. Recognized February as Black History Month across Canada. The motion passed unanimously, and years later she told TVO about what was really driving that push.

</details>

**让·奥古斯丁** (引述): 我觉得在某个时候，必须有人来处理课程，事情不应该只停留在页边脚注里，而应该融入到加拿大历史的教学中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jean Augustine (quoted)**: I felt that at some point in time, someone had to address curriculum, that things should not be in the footnote along the margins, but should be integrated into the teaching of Canadian history.

</details>

**主持人**: 三十多年过去了，她的愿景实现了吗？安大略省省长**道格·福特**（Doug Ford）最近宣布，原定去年推出的新黑人历史课程，将于今年九月在安省学校开设。我们将探讨这些课程的意义以及专家认为仍需做些什么。我们还将走出教室，因为历史不仅仅存在于教科书中。我们将带您前往圣凯瑟琳斯的塞勒姆教堂（Salem Chapel），那里曾是**哈里特·塔布曼**（Harriet Tubman）崇拜的地方，也是地下铁路和争取民权斗争留下真实印记的地方。欢迎来到“The Rundown”。安省教育部最近宣布计划于今年九月为七、八和十年级引入新的黑人历史课程。让我们来谈谈目前课堂如何涵盖黑人历史以及即将发生的变化。**娜塔莎**（Natasha），我先请教你。将黑人加拿大人的贡献纳入历史课程为什么很重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: More than 30 years on, has her vision been realised? Premier Doug Ford recently announced that new black history courses, originally meant to roll out last year, will now be coming to Ontario schools this September. We're going to look at what these courses will mean and what experts say still needs to be done. We're also stepping outside of the classroom because history doesn't just exist in textbooks. We're taking you to Salem Chapel in St. Catharines, where Harriet Tubman once worshipped, and where the Underground Railroad and the fight for civil rights left a very real mark. Welcome to "The Rundown." Ontario's Ministry of Education recently announced plans to introduce new courses on black history for grades seven, eight and ten this coming September. So let's talk about how black history is covered in classrooms now and what's set to change. Natasha, I'm going to start with you. Why is including Black Canadian contributions to the history curriculum important?

</details>

**娜塔莎**: 这非常重要，因为它呈现了更准确的加拿大历史。它真正将非洲裔人士定位在我们称之为加拿大及其演变、其成长的这个项目中，并再次，真正帮助人们理解我们在这里已经存在了很长时间，四百年，与欧洲殖民化同步。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natasha**: It's very important because it presents a more accurate history of Canada. It really locates people of African descent within this project that we call Canada and its evolution, its growth over time and again, really then helps people to understand that we've been here for a very long time, 400 years, alongside European colonisation.

</details>

**主持人**: **格雷格**（Greg），很多人会说黑人历史就是加拿大历史。你认为为什么将这些贡献添加到我们的历史课程中很重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Greg, many people will say black history is Canadian history. Why do you think it's important that we add these contributions to our history curriculum?

</details>

**格雷格**: 你刚才说的正是我打算说的一部分，我觉得，我认为在没有纳入各方声音的情况下教授历史是一个挑战。我鼓励我的学生理解，我们在教授历史时，其中一部分是“去学习”（unlearning）。你不去学习，就无法真正学习。我认为过去几十年来我们面临的问题之一是，我们把自己置于一个可以真正学习真实历史并理解一直以来存在着未被听到的声音的境地，而这些声音需要成为我们加拿大叙事的一部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg**: It's interesting you just said part of what I was going to say, and I think, I think the idea of teaching history without incorporating voices is, is a challenge. I encourage my students to understand that part of what we do in teaching history is unlearning. You can't learn until you unlearn. And I think part of the problem that we faced with over the last how many decades is putting ourselves in a situation where we can actually learn true history and understand that there have been voices that haven't been heard for so long, and those voices need to be a part of our Canadian narrative.

</details>

### 课程延迟与争议

**主持人**: 据我们所知，该课程原定去年推出，但被推迟到2026年9月。现在，一些评论家认为，这一暂停是政治上对进步课程内容感到不适的反映。娜塔莎，我想听听你对此的看法。你怎么看？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: As we know, the curriculum was slated to roll out last year but was delayed until September 2026. Now, some critics say that the pause was a reflection of political discomfort with progressive curriculum content. I want to get both of your takes on it, Natasha. What do you think?

</details>

**娜塔莎**: 嗯，我们可以从几个方面来解读。是的，你可以这样解读，并思考，这是不是因为某种程度的不适，考虑到当时更广泛的政治气候？或者我们也可以退一步想，也许，并希望，教育部是想制作出高质量的内容，这需要更多时间进行审查过程，以收集反馈并实施，你知道，他们收到的任何材料。所以，我希望在第二种解读下，会有高质量的内容产出，而他们需要时间来完成。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natasha**: Well, we can read that in several ways. Yes, you can read it, as you know and wonder, is it because of some level of discomfort, given the wider political climate of the time? Or we can also take a step back and think that maybe and hopefully that the ministry wants to produce something of high quality, which requires more time for the review process to gather feedback to implement, you know, any material that they receive from experts. And so, you know, I'm hoping in the second stream that that there will be something produced of high quality and that they needed the time in order to do so.

</details>

**主持人**: 格雷格，在我问你之前，我应该提到，**部长卡兰德拉**（Minister Calandra）确实提到暂停是必要的，既是为了允许引入更一致、全省范围的课程方法，也是为了，正如你所提到的，确保教师有足够的时间来正确地在课堂上实施。作为一个身处课堂的人，你知道当课程被下发，并且有变动时，时间也是需要的。但你对这种暂停及其背后的理由有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Now, Greg, before I come to you, I should mention that Minister Calandra did mention that the pause was necessary for both to allow for the introduction of more consistent, province wide approach to the curriculum, but also to, as you mentioned, to ensure teachers can have the time they need to properly implement that in their classroom. As someone who is in the classroom, you know that when curriculum is given to you, when there's changes, time is needed as well. But what are your thoughts about sort of that pause and sort of the reasoning?

</details>

**格雷格**: 我认为我会呼应娜塔莎刚才说的。我认为暂停可能，或者我希望，暂停是为了装备教育工作者提供适当的资源。我认为不幸的现实是，大多数黑人教育工作者在面对黑人历史、黑人历史月时，既感到兴奋，也带有一丝恐惧。我认为现实是，当我们集体，作为黑人教育工作者，成为知识的来源时，我们几乎不得不成为讲述故事的人。而讲述故事可能充满创伤。所以我认为我希望，也许这次暂停提供了一个必要的机会，以确保所有教师都能获得资源，这样就不是关于说，“嘿，你的经历是什么样的？”因为这种情况经常发生，而且有很多学生在课堂上可能是唯一一个黑人学生，老师会看着他们说，“嘿，顺便说一句，你作为黑人加拿大人，经历是怎样的？这很难。这真的很难。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg**: I think I'd echo what Natasha said earlier as well. I think the pause potentially, or I'd like to think that the pause was done with the intention of equipping educators with the proper resources. I think the unfortunate reality is most black educators approach black history, Black History Month with excitement, but also with a little bit of trepidation. I think the reality is, is that when we collectively, as black educators, become the source of knowledge, it's almost like we have to be the ones telling the story. And telling the story can be traumatic. So I think I'd like to think that this pause maybe gives a necessary opportunity to ensure that all teachers can have access to resources so that it's not about saying, hey, what was your experience like? Because that happens all the time, and there are a lot of students who experience that trauma when there might be the only ones in the class, and the teacher looks at them and says, hey, by the way, what's your experience like being a black Canadian? It's hard. It's really hard.

</details>

**娜塔莎**: 是的。而且我想补充一点，你知道，关于暂停，这是为了实际发布学习主题，并且在此期间，还要策划和开发一些资源。然后一旦这些资源发布了，就应该有一些培训。你提到了，你知道，黑人教师们长期以来在教授黑人历史方面一直很稳定。但一直存在不均衡。而且我认为还有一点很重要，就是教师需要更多的培训，尤其是当教学人口以白人为主时，正如你之前所说，会有大量的“去学习”和新的学习需要发生，以便他们能将这些带入课堂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natasha**: Yes. And I would just add to that to say, you know, with the pause, it's the pause for the actual release of what the learning topics will be, and that in that interim, there are also curating and developing some resources. And then once those are rolled out, then there should be some training. And you talked about, you know, black teachers who have, you know, for a long time, you know, been consistent in teaching black history. And there has been an unevenness. And I think there's also an important thing to think about that teachers require more training, especially when the teaching population is majority white, that there will be, as you had said before, a lot of unlearning and new learning that would need to take place for educators in order for them to bring this to the classroom.

</details>

### 当前教学现状

**主持人**: 绝对。好的。让我们来谈谈现在课堂上教授的内容。格雷格，你如何评价目前安省学校教授黑人历史的情况？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Definitely. Alright. Let's talk about what's being taught right now in the classroom. Greg, how would you assess how black history is currently taught in Ontario schools?

</details>

**格雷格**: 我只能以我的高中经历来谈。再说一遍，我不需要有人强制要求或在我面前摆出教授黑人历史的期望。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg**: I can only speak to my high school experience. Again, I didn't need someone to mandate or place in front of me the expectation of teaching black history.

</details>

**主持人**: 你教什么？我们来澄清一下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And what do you teach? Let's clarify.

</details>

**格雷格**: 我教十年级加拿大历史，也教十二年级的社会正义课程。因此，将黑人历史融入这些课程中，我认为这是至关重要的，如果我们仅仅从创伤角度或“他们是什么”的角度来谈论黑人叙事，那么我们不一定能获得黑人加拿大人四百多年贡献的真实历史。你和很多孩子交谈，他们会告诉你关于地下铁路的事。我们的旅程并非始于地下铁路。我认为认识到这一点很重要，并让教育工作者有机会将这段叙事作为我们故事的一部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg**: So I teach grade ten Canadian history, and I also teach a social justice course at the grade 12 level as well. And so incorporating black history into these lessons, I think it's crucial if we are only talking about the black narrative from a trauma based perspective or from a what is them perspective, then we don't necessarily get the true history of the contributions of Black Canadians to the over 400 years. You talk to many kids and they'll tell you about the Underground Railroad. Our journey didn't begin with the Underground Railroad. I think that's important that we acknowledge that, and we give educators the opportunity to have that narrative a part of our story.

</details>

**主持人**: 我很好奇，我现在就想坐在你的教室里，坐在你的学生中间。你教我什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I am curious, I want to be in your classroom right now, sitting amongst your students. What are you teaching me?

</details>

**格雷格**: 你知道我在教你们什么吗？是那些未被听到的声音。我教你们一个机会去认识到，在当今时代，我们是历史的一部分。而我们的故事源远流长。我总是告诉我的学生，除非你是我们第一民族、梅蒂人和因纽特人的一员，否则每个人都有一个移民故事。我认为移民故事造就了加拿大这个真正的国家，一个建设者的国家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg**: You know what I'm teaching you to hear? The voices that haven't been heard. I'm teaching you an opportunity to recognize that we currently, in today's day and age, are a part of history. And our story goes far back. I tell my students all the time that everyone, unless you're a member of our First Nation, Métis and Inuit population, has an immigration story. And I think that immigration story is what makes Canada a true nation, a nation of builders.

</details>

**主持人**: 娜塔莎。我们回到之前的话题。你如何评价目前安省学校教授黑人历史的情况？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Natasha. So let's go back. How would you assess how black history is currently being taught in Ontario schools?

</details>

**娜塔莎**: 嗯，我会说，由于多种原因，情况非常不均衡。例如，一种观点认为，他们教授黑人历史应该侧重于学生群体。所以如果你学校里有黑人学生，你就可以教黑人历史。但如果你没有黑人学生，那就没有必要。而这是一种狭隘的教授黑人历史的观点，因为正如我们之前讨论过的，黑人加拿大历史就是加拿大历史。还有一种方式是，黑人，黑人加拿大的经历常常被用来支撑更广泛的、占主导地位的加拿大叙事。所以实际上，并没有侧重于黑人历史、黑人个体、黑人社区。它被用来，例如，在地下铁路时代，将加拿大美化为一个自由人的地方。但我们从未学习或他们从未深入研究过那些人是谁，他们的经历是怎样的。所以有这一点，还有围绕着加拿大社会强加给黑人的结构性障碍的现实，以及他们如何回应、反应并帮助改变这一切的担忧或某种程度的恐惧。所以那里存在一种不适感。还有最后一点，我想说的是，关于黑人加拿大在四百多年里的定位，有不同的方式，你知道，奴隶制下的强制移民，移民，但黑人也是多元的，他们的经历和出身各不相同，而且人们常常不称黑人加拿大人为黑人加拿大人，而是称他们为非裔美国人，这是我们还有很长路要走的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natasha**: Well, I would say that it's very uneven for a variety of reasons from, for example, the view that they're teaching black history should be taught focusing on the student population. And so if you have a black presence in your school, then you can teach black history. But if you don't have a black presence then there's no need to. And that is a very myopic view of teaching black history, because as we've talked about before, black Canadian history is Canadian history. There's also a way in which black, the black Canadian experience is often used to prop up the wider, the dominant Canadian narrative. So in fact, there isn't a focus on black history, on black individuals, on black communities. It's used in a way to, for example, glorify Canada as a place of freedom for freedom seekers during the Underground Railroad era. And but we never learn or they never delve into who those individuals were, what their experiences were like. And so there's that and there's also a concern or some level of trepidation around addressing the realities of structural barriers that Canadian society imposed upon black people and how they responded to and reacted and helped to change that. And so there is a level of discomfort there. And then one last thing I would say is that the framing of who black Canada was and over 400 years, there are different ways, you know, forced migration under chattel slavery, immigration, but also that black people are diverse in their experiences and their origins, and that oftentimes people don't name black Canadians as black Canadians, but often as African Americans, which is another thing that we have to we still have a long way to go.

</details>

### 课程内容与实施

**主持人**: 我想深入了解课程。涉及七、八和十年级。请帮助我们理解，在小学和初中是否充分涵盖了这些内容？我是娜塔莎。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I want to get into sort of the the curriculums. Grades are specific seven, eight and ten. Help us understand, is this being covered adequately in primary and junior grades? I'm Natasha.

</details>

**娜塔莎**: 当然。嗯，答案很简单，理想情况下，应该有特定的期望融入或贯穿整个课程。七、八和十年级。选择这些年级的理由是，那时是历史主题的重点。从一年级到六年级是社会研究。然后七、八年级以及十年级是教授特定历史科目的年级。所以这就是选择这些年级的理由。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natasha**: Sure. Well, no very simple answer in the sense that, you know, ideally there would be specific expectations woven into or integrated throughout the curriculum. Grades seven, eight and ten. The rationale for choosing that is that that's when there's a focus on the actual subject of history. And so from grades 1 to 6 is social studies. And then seven, eight and then ten are the grades in which there are specific history subjects that are taught. And so that would be the rationale for selecting those grades.

</details>

**主持人**: 这里有机会吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Is there an opportunity there?

</details>

**娜塔莎**: 完全有，绝对有。在我教学的整个过程中，都有充足的机会。你知道，这是我的专业领域。我从幼儿园一直教到大学，并且有充足的机会将黑人加拿大历史融入其中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natasha**: Absolutely, absolutely. There's opportunities throughout I've been teaching. You know, this is my area of expertise. I've been teaching from kinder garden through to now, university, and there's ample opportunities to integrate Black Canadian history throughout.

</details>

**主持人**: 格雷格，当学生们到了十年级，有些人可能只知道你提到的地下铁路作为黑人历史的一个例子。黑人历史是否应该在小学阶段也强制推行？是否有机会？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Now, Greg, by the time they get to you in grade ten, for some people, perhaps they only have what you mentioned, the Underground Railroad as an example of of black history. Should black history be mandated in primary grades as well? Is there an opportunity?

</details>

**格雷格**: 我完全同意娜塔莎的观点。我认为我们面临的挑战并非一定是将黑人历史局限于历史课。我认为我们认为，当你教授历史时，它必须是一门历史课程。但说实话。当我们谈论黑人加拿大人对历史的贡献时，这不仅仅是历史领域，还包括科学和技术。它体现在医学、文学、政治中。那么为什么我们只将课程局限于一门只说它是历史课的课程呢？为什么我们不在科学课中这样做？为什么我们不在数学课中这样做？为什么我们不这样做？再说一遍，我们谈论学习和“去学习”。我们学习了很多数学家、科学家的名字，并将他们视为某个事物的创造者。那么，让我们，让我们，让我们现在深入挖掘一下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg**: I would completely agree with Natasha. I think the challenge that we face is not necessarily locating black history in history. I think we believe that when you teach history, it has to be in a history course. But let's be serious. When we talk about the contributions of black Canadians, it's not just in the areas of history, it's science and technology. It's in medicine, it's in literature, it's in politics. So why are we just locating a curriculum in a course that just says it's a history course? Why aren't we doing this in the sciences? Why aren't we doing this in the maths? Why aren't we doing? Again, we talk about learning and unlearning. There are a lot of names that we learn as mathematicians, as scientists, and we learn them as the source of, well, this is who created this. And well, let's, let's, let's pull back a couple layers now and really look.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么，娜塔莎，我不得不问，谁来决定包含什么，排除什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Well, with that being said, Natasha, I have to ask who gets to decide on what to include and what not to or exclude from the history?

</details>

**娜塔莎**: 这是一个非常好的问题。课程是政策，对吧？所以这是教育部。谁负责设计，在教室教师、各领域专家的支持和指导下，以及社区成员的意见输入下？并且有一个反馈过程，取决于课程处于哪个阶段。你可以来回反馈。而最终决定生产什么并分发给教室教师的是教育部。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natasha**: And that's a very good question. Curriculum is policy, right? And so that it's the Ministry of Education. Who's responsible for designated that with the support and direction of classroom teachers, experts in various fields, as well as input from community members. And there's a feedback process depending on which stage of the curriculum it's in. And you can have that back and forth. And then the ultimate decision in terms of what is produced and dispensed to classroom teachers is the is the Ministry of Education.

</details>

**主持人**: 格雷格，作为一个身处课堂的人，你是否参与了这些咨询？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Greg, as someone who's in the classroom, are you part of these consultations as well?

</details>

**格雷格**: 这很有趣。你确实触及了那个三角。你谈论政府，你谈论教育工作者，你谈论社区伙伴在这个反馈过程中。我个人没有参与过这个过程。我并不是说其他教育工作者没有参与，但我很希望看到这个积极的过程真正变得更加透明，这样如果你是一名教育工作者，并且对此感兴趣，并且可以参与其中，那么你就应该参与。但你说得对，这是政策。而归根结底，所有这些各方都需要能够有效地整合。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg**: It's interesting. I think you really hit that triad. You talk about government, you talk about educators, and you talk about community partners in that that feedback process. I personally have not been a part of that process. I'm not saying that other education educators haven't, but I would really like to see that active process really be a little more transparent so that if you are an educator and you are interested in this and you can be a part of it, then you should be. But you're right, it is policy. And at the end of the day, all those parties need to be able to come together to integrate effectively.

</details>

**主持人**: 娜塔莎，你认为改变课程以更广泛地代表历史的最大障碍是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Natasha, what would you say is the biggest roadblock to changing the curriculum for broader representation of history?

</details>

**娜塔莎**: 最大的障碍在于不同层面的意愿。无论是在教育部层面，因为安省所有学生必须了解的黑人存在四百年历史，从来没有一个统一的规定，它一直是教师、校长、家庭的个人选择。所以你需要有这层意愿，以及一致性，还有学校董事会层面以及课堂层面。再次看到，是的，将其纳入官方课程是好的，但仅仅是为了真实地代表加拿大历史，黑人叙事也应该被包含在内。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natasha**: The biggest roadblock is is will right on different levels. And so whether it's at the Ministry of Education level, because there's never been one thing that all students in Ontario have to learn about the 400 year presence of black people in Canada, it's always been an option by individual teachers and principals, you know, families. And so you need to have the will at that level and the consistency as well as school board levels and and in the classroom as well. To see again that, yes, it's good that it becomes part of the official curriculum, but just by the nature of wanting to represent a truthful history of Canada, that the black narrative should be included.

</details>

**主持人**: 格雷格。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Greg.

</details>

**格雷格**: 我认为有两个主要障碍。第一是误解。我认为在理解我们如何实施课程方面，误解是巨大的。关于谁的故事被讲述以及故事如何被讲述。我认为我们还有“我不知道足够多”的想法。所以当你谈论个人选择时，如果我教数学，而我对二次方程了解不够，我会去学；如果我教化学，而我对波义耳定律了解不够，我会去学。但我认为我们允许个人说，“我不知道足够多”，这让他们可以不实施某些想法。当你看到误解时，比如约翰·麦克唐纳（John Macdonald）学校更名时的反对声音，人们认为，好吧，当你重命名一所学校时，你就是在改写历史。我们不是在改写历史。我们只是在试图揭示更多层面，以便讲述真实的历史。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg**: I would say there are two major roadblocks. Number one is misconception. I think misconception is huge when it comes to understanding how we implement curriculum. This idea of of whose story is being told and how is that story being told. I think we also have this idea of I don't know enough. And so when you talk about individual choice, if I was teaching math and I didn't know enough about quadratics, I'd learn if I was teaching chemistry and I didn't know enough about Boyle's law, I'd learn. But I think we allow individuals to say, I don't know enough, and that excuses them from having to implement certain ideas. When you look at misconception, the pushback when you had the renaming of John Macdonald's schools, people believe that, well, when you rename a school, what you're doing is you're rewriting history. We're not rewriting history. We're just trying to pull back more layers to allow true history to be to be to be told.

</details>

**主持人**: 我想问一下，如果**部长保罗·卡兰德拉**（Minister Paul Calandra）坐在我们对面，你会告诉他关于在我们的课程中更广泛地纳入黑人历史以及你提到的那些障碍？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I do want to ask if you had the minister, Paul Calandra, sitting across from us at this table, what would you tell him about sort of the broader editions of of black history to our curriculum and sort of those roadblocks that you bring up?

</details>

**娜塔莎**: 我会说，这是基于黑人父母、社区成员、教育工作者几十年的倡导，一项迟到已久的举措。我们应该将其视为一个步骤，而不是最终步骤，而是需要采取的几个步骤之一，以便持续并更好地代表。历史是一门学科，但正如格雷格之前提到的，需要在所有学科领域进行融合和认可。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natasha**: Well, I would say that this is a long overdue step based on decades of advocacy from black parents, community members, educators, and that we should see it not as the ultimate step, but as one step of several that needs to be taken in order to continuously and to better represent. History is one subject, but as Greg has mentioned earlier, that there needs to be integration and recognition in all subject areas.

</details>

**主持人**: 格雷格。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Greg.

</details>

**格雷格**: 你知道，我们经常听到“基础越广，塔越高”，我认为这非常重要。基础是巨大的，第一步是好的，但我们必须有意识地确保我们不仅仅是为了完成任务而这样做。我们这样做是为了有意识地向前迈进。必须有一个长期的计划。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg**: You know, we've often heard the broader the base, the taller the tower, and I think it's very important. Foundations are huge, first steps are good, but we have to be intentional in making sure that we're not just doing this to check a box. We're doing this to be intentional about how we move forward. There has to be a long term plan.

</details>

### 个人视角与资源推荐

**主持人**: 好的。在我们最后几分钟里，我想知道你最喜欢的、不为人所知的黑人历史片段是什么？娜塔莎。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Alright. And the last few minutes that we have, I want to know what is your favorite not widely known piece of black history? Natasha.

</details>

**娜塔莎**: 这对我来说是个很难的问题。我想说，在过去的几年里，我一直更专注于安省的黑人历史，并且我惊叹于不断了解到黑人遍布全省各地。我们经常想到像查塔姆和温莎的黑人社区，以及像多伦多这样的大城市，但自1800年代以来，黑人就居住在北部矿区和各种地方。但对我来说，我认为这是非常有趣的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natasha**: That's a very hard question for me. I would say that I've, for the past few years been focusing quite a bit more on black history in Ontario, and I'm amazed to continuously learn about black people being all across the province. We often think about like the black communities in Chatham and Windsor and in major cities like Toronto, but black people since the 1800s have resided and lived in all places in northern mines and, you know, in a range of places. But for me, I think that that's something that's quite interesting.

</details>

**主持人**: 地理。好吧。格雷格，很有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Geography. Well, okay. Greg, interesting.

**格雷格**: 我试图让我的学生做一项鼓励他们调查社区的任务。我去蒙特利尔，我们都将爵士乐与美国联系起来。但蒙特利尔的爵士乐场景多年来一直很繁荣。你可能会发现像**鲁弗斯·罗克黑德**（Rufus Rockhead）这样的人，一位牙买加移民，他克服了许多困难，成为了蒙特利尔爵士乐的源泉，甚至在禁酒令期间，在大萧条期间，当美国边境以南几乎没有什么事情发生时，所有伟大的艺术家都来到蒙特利尔，像**比莉·哈乐黛**（Billie Holiday）、**萨米·戴维斯**（Sammy Davis Jr.）、**路易斯·阿姆斯特朗**（Louis Armstrong），他们都来到了蒙特利尔。你知道，这是一个充满活力的，你知道，小勃艮第。对。充满活力的社区，我们这里确实有。

**Greg**: I try to do a task with my students that encourage them to investigate communities. And I, I go to Montreal and the idea of we all connect jazz to the United States. But the jazz scene in Montreal has been rich for years. And you get an individual like Rufus Rockhead, you know, a Jamaican immigrant who comes here defies many odds and becomes the source of jazz in Montreal, even to the point where during prohibition, during the Great Depression, where nothing was really happening south of the border, all of the greats were coming here the Billie Holiday, the Sammy Davis Jr, the Louis Armstrong, they were all coming to Montreal. And it's just it's a vibrant, you know, little Burgundy. Right. Vibrant communities that we have here for sure.

**主持人**: 非常有趣。好的。为了纪念黑人历史月，我们请你们每人推荐一个资源给我们的观众和听众。娜塔莎，你在安省档案馆（Archives of Ontario）做了一些很棒的事情。告诉我们关于“照亮黑人”（Illuminate Black）展览。

**Host**: Very interesting. Alright. In honour of Black History Month, we asked each of you to recommend one resource for our viewers and listeners. Natasha, you were doing something cool at the Archives of Ontario. Tell us about Illuminate Black, the exhibition.

</details>

**娜塔莎**: 与...合作。我正在策划一个名为“照亮黑人：照亮安省黑人存在的展览”，与**Blue Rhino Design**合作。这个展览将于本月晚些时候开放，将在安省档案馆展出两年。它提供了对安省鲜为人知的黑人历史故事的精彩概述。

**Natasha**: Working with. I'm curating an exhibit called Illuminate Black shining a light on the black presence in Ontario, working with Blue Rhino Design. This exhibit is going to be opening up at the end of this month, and we'll be running for two years at the Archives of Ontario. Just giving a wonderful overview of lesser known stories of black history in Ontario.

**主持人**: 格雷格。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Greg.

</details>

**格雷格**: **Sid Sutherland**和**Jennifer Holmes**制作了一系列黑人系列节目，这是一个很棒的四部分纪录片系列，我们谈论了四百年历史，它真正讲述了历史，讲述了黑人加拿大经历中超越刻板印象的地下铁路的未知故事。它真正记录了时间和地点，并提供了历史、社会评论，同时也关注了地理以及从海岸到海岸的不同地点在真正培养强大的黑人加拿大存在中所扮演的角色。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Greg**: There's a series of black series produced by Sid Sutherland and Jennifer Holmes, and it is a great four part docu series that really we talk about the 400 years, and it really tells the history, it tells the story, the unknown stories of the Black Canadian experience beyond the stereotypical Underground railroad. And it really documents time and place, and it gives both a historical, a social commentary, but also looks at geography and the role that different locations from coast to coast have played in really cultivating a strong black Canadian presence.

</details>

**主持人**: 那是“黑人与起源故事”。好的，娜塔莎，格雷格，太棒了。非常感谢你们的见解。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And that's black and origin story origin. Alright Natasha Greg, that was fantastic. Thank you so much for your insights.

**主持人**: 我正站在一座历史悠久的小建筑前。这是安省圣凯瑟琳斯的塞勒姆教堂。许多人认为这是安省最古老的黑人教堂。它建于1855年，但其会众的历史可以追溯到1814年。它最著名的成员是**哈里特·塔布曼**，她在19世纪中期居住在该地区。从这里，这位地下铁路的组织者策划了救援任务，她营救的许多人最终定居在这里，成为教堂的成员。让我们来了解更多关于这个礼拜和活动场所。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I'm standing in front of a small building with a big history. This is Salem Chapel in St. Catharines, Ontario. Many people believe this church is the oldest black church in Ontario. It was built in 1855, but its congregation dates back to 1814. Its most famous member, Harriet Tubman, who lived in the area in the mid 19th century. From here, the Underground Railroad conductor organised rescue missions and many of those she rescued ended up settling here, becoming church members. So let's find out more about this place of worship and activism.

</details>

**罗谢尔·布什**（Rochelle Bush）: 我叫罗谢尔·布什。我是塞勒姆教堂、英国卫理公会圣公会教堂、哈里特·塔布曼地下铁路国家历史遗址的受托人兼驻地历史学家。我也是Tubman Tours Canada的所有者和经营者。欢迎来到塞勒姆教堂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rochelle Bush**: My name is Rochelle Bush. I'm the trustee as well as resident historian of the Salem Chapel, British Methodist Episcopal Church, Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historic Site. I'm also the owner and operator of Tubman Tours, Canada. Welcome to the Salem Chapel.

</details>

**主持人**: 罗谢尔，非常感谢您接待我们来到塞勒姆教堂。我们现在坐在一个充满历史的地方。您能告诉我为什么这个地方对这个地区如此特别吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Rochelle, thank you so much for having us here at the Salem Chapel. We are sitting in a place that has a lot of history. Can you tell me why this place is so special to this area?

</details>

**罗谢尔·布什**: 嗯，塞勒姆教堂是由非洲裔美国自由寻求者于1855年建造的。它是加拿大英国卫理公会圣公会教堂的一部分。实际上，它是圣凯瑟琳斯市的第三个教堂。第一个教堂建在Queenston Street地区。我们知道它现在是Richard Pierpoint Park地区，他是第一位定居在圣凯瑟琳斯的黑人。所以第一个教堂建于1820年左右。我们于1835年搬到这个社区。我们建造了第二座教堂，然后于1855年建造了这座第三座教堂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rochelle Bush**: Well, the Salem Chapel was built by African American freedom seekers in 1855. So it's a part of the British Methodist Episcopal Churches of Canada. And actually, it's the third site in the city of St. Catharines. The first one was constructed in Queenston Street area. We know it as Richard Pierpoint Park area, and he was the first black person to settle in St. Catharines. So the first one was constructed around 1820. We were relocated over to this neighbourhood 1835. We built the second church, and then 1855 we built this third church.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以就目前而言，这里很安静。当我们在这里静坐时，这里非常平静。但这曾是一座非常活跃的教堂。这里仍然有礼拜活动，对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So in terms of this place right now, it's quiet. It is very calm as we were sitting in silence here. But this is a very active church. There is still worship that happens here, correct?

</details>

**罗谢尔·布什**: 是的。所以我们首先也是最重要的仍然是一个宗教机构。我们每周日举行礼拜仪式。这是一座活跃的教堂，但我们只有不到十名成员。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rochelle Bush**: Yes. So we still continue as a religious institution first and foremost. So we meet every Sunday for worship service. It is an active church, but we have less than a dozen members.

</details>

**主持人**: 欢迎大家来到这里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And as everyone welcome here.

</details>

**罗谢尔·布什**: 哦，今天的教堂非常多元化。所以并非所有成员都是像我这样的自由寻求者的后裔。我们也有白人成员。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rochelle Bush**: Oh, the church today is very diverse. So not all members are freedom seeker descendants like myself. And we do have white members as well.

</details>

**主持人**: 我现在想谈谈过去的会众。它最著名的教区居民是谁？是谁？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I want to now talk about the congregation of the past. It's most famous parishioner. Who was it?

</details>

**罗谢尔·布什**: **哈里特·塔布曼**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rochelle Bush**: Harriet Tubman.

</details>

**主持人**: 告诉我关于她。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Tell me about it.

</details>

**罗谢尔·布什**: 哈里特·塔布曼是我们最著名的成员。塔布曼是19世纪的自由战士。她帮助解放了被奴役的非洲裔美国人。她引导他们来到圣凯瑟琳斯。今天，她被视为地下铁路的标志性人物。哈里特·塔布曼最重要的一点是，她是第一位被加拿大和美国两个国家指定为国家重要人物的非洲裔美国人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rochelle Bush**: So Harriet Tubman is our most famous member. So Tubman was a freedom fighter in the 19th century. She helped liberate enslaved African Americans. And she guided them here to St. Catharines. Today, she is regarded as the iconic figure of the Underground Railroad. And what's most important about Harriet Tubman is she's the first person African American to be designated a person of national importance in two countries in Canada, as well as the United States.

</details>

**主持人**: 她从南方到北方的旅程有时会受到质疑，她最终去了哪里。您能带我了解一下她的旅程吗？她是如何到达圣凯瑟琳斯的，为什么是圣凯瑟琳斯？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Her journey from the south up here sometimes is in question as to where she ended up. Can you walk me through that journey? How did she get to St. Catharines and why St. Catharines?

</details>

**罗谢尔·布什**: 哈里特·塔布曼出生于马里兰州多切斯特县，于1849年逃离奴役，前往费城。在美国政府通过1850年《逃奴法案》后，她不得不延长她的地下铁路路线，直至抵达英属殖民地。当时，这里是英国殖民地。非洲裔美国人在这里可以获得安全和自由的保障，因为在1850年《逃奴法案》通过后，北方变成了奴隶捕获者的天堂。所以她与费城的人脉网络已经与圣凯瑟琳斯的废奴主义者建立了联系。她从东海岸沿着东线来到这里，因为根据**弗雷德里克·道格拉斯**（Frederick Douglass）在1881年的说法，这里是东线地下铁路的最后一站。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rochelle Bush**: So Harriet Tubman was born in Dorchester County, Maryland, and she escaped from enslavement in 1849 and made her way to Philadelphia. After the U.S. government passed the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, she had to extend her Underground Railroad route to British soil. So this was a British colony at the time, of course. And this is where African Americans would be granted or guaranteed their safety and freedom, because the North, after the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law passed, that was turned into a haven for slave catchers. So the network of people that she was connected with in Philadelphia, they were already connected with abolitionists here in St. Catharines. So she came out of the eastern shore along the eastern line and ended here because St. Catharines, according to Frederick Douglass, in 1881, this was the last stop for the Underground Railroad from the eastern line.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，我想谈谈弗雷德里克·道格拉斯。他也曾在这里礼拜。这里曾发生过集会。告诉我他的重要性以及他在这里的历史。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Well, I want to talk about Frederick Douglass. He worshipped here as well. This was a place where there were meetings that were happening. Tell me about his significance and his history here in this building.

</details>

**罗谢尔·布什**: 弗雷德里克·道格拉斯曾九次到访圣凯瑟琳斯。作为非洲卫理公会圣公会的一员。所以我们得承认，在19世纪，宗教就是你的货币。所以你参加礼拜。所以这是一个非洲裔美国人的安全空间。如果他在圣凯瑟琳斯，那么他就会在这里礼拜，因为他已经是卫理公会教徒了。但这并不会否定他可能去了锡安浸信会教堂，那也是一个浸信会教堂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rochelle Bush**: So we have Frederick Douglass on record coming through St. Catharines nine times. And as a member of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. So let's be real. In the 19th century, religion was your currency. So you attended service. So this was a safe space for African Americans. And if he was in St. Catharines, then he would have worshipped here because he was already Methodist. But that would not have negated the fact that he may have went down to Zion Baptist Church, which was a Baptist church as well.

</details>

**主持人**: 您实际上与这座教堂有着非常特殊的联系，家庭联系。能告诉我关于那件事吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: You actually have a very special connection, a family connection to this chapel. Tell me about that.

</details>

**罗谢尔·布什**: 是的。我与塞勒姆教堂的联系是我外祖父的曾祖父。我母亲一方的曾祖父是哈里特·塔布曼在这里时的负责人。他是一位非洲卫理公会圣公会牧师，自由人，出生于南卡罗来纳州哥伦比亚。然后他来到加拿大，定居在圣凯瑟琳斯，并成为这座教堂的成员和牧师。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rochelle Bush**: Yes. So my connection to the Salem Chapel is my two times great grandfather on my maternal side. So my mother's side was the minister in charge here for a period of time when Harriet Tubman was here. So he was an African Methodist Episcopal minister, free, born in Columbia, South Carolina. And then he made his way here to Canada, settled in St. Catharines, and became a member and minister of this church.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以曾祖父的曾祖父，两位曾祖父。哇。关于那段知识以及您知道这个家庭联系，它是如何传达给您的？您是如何知道的？是您个人探索的结果，还是……？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So great great, great, two great two greats. Oh, wow. In terms of that knowledge and knowing that family connection, how was that told to you? How did you know? Was that something that you went on a personal journey or was that.

</details>

**罗谢尔·布什**: 这是一个很好的问题。是的，我进行了一次个人探索。我们一直被告知他参与了地下铁路。但在我看来，他能四处旅行，这说不通。所以他在安省以及密歇根、肯塔基、纽约等地旅行，因为他们当时是巡回传教士，也是传教士。结果他是一位自由的黑人男子，所以他能够做到这一点。他并非地下铁路的一部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rochelle Bush**: That's a great question. And yes, I did go on a personal journey. We were always told that he was part of the Underground Railroad 2005. It just didn't make sense to me as to why he could be travelling all over the place. So in Ontario as well as Michigan, Kentucky, New York City, because they were stump preachers at the time, missionaries as well. Turns out he was a free black man, so that's how he was able to do it. He wasn't part of the Underground Railroad.

</details>

**主持人**: 非常有趣。Tubman Tours Canada。是的，在后面加上了加拿大。这是一个深思熟虑的举动吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Very interesting. Tubman tours Canada. Yes, adding Canada at the end. Was that a deliberate move?

</details>

**罗谢尔·布什**: 是的，这是一个深思熟虑的举动。所以我把加拿大加在了旅游公司名称的后面，这样人们就会意识到她与加拿大有关。大多数人不知道。我本来想说Tubman Tours Ontario。但后来我想，你知道吗，让我们把它拓宽，定为加拿大。但之后，我有人问，她去了加拿大的哪里？我只是忽略了它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rochelle Bush**: Yes, it was a deliberate move. So I added Canada at the end of the tour company name so that people would be aware of the fact that she did have a connection to Canada. Most people have no idea. So I was going to say Tubman Tours Ontario. But then I thought, you know what, let's broaden it out, make it Canada. But then after that, I had people asking, where did she go in Canada? And I just ignored it.

</details>

**主持人**: 说得对。人们认为她去了哪里？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Fair enough. Where do people think that she she went?

</details>

**罗谢尔·布什**: 大多数人不知道。而那些认为她来到加拿大的人，他们认为去了新斯科舍省。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rochelle Bush**: Most don't know. And those who do assume that she came to Canada, they think Nova Scotia.

</details>

**主持人**: 为什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Why?

</details>

**罗谢尔·布什**: 因为历史记载，在美国独立战争期间，大多数非洲裔美国人去了新斯科舍省。所以每个人都知道非洲裔美国人去了新斯科舍省。这本书因此而闻名，《黑人之书》（The Book of Negroes），由**劳伦斯·希尔**（Lawrence Hill）撰写。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rochelle Bush**: Because that's where history records that the majority of African Americans went during the American Revolution. So everybody knows about African Americans going to Nova Scotia. The book was most famous for that, The Book of Negroes, written by Lawrence Hill.

</details>

**主持人**: 我想了解一下经过这个建筑的人们。他们主要是加拿大人还是美国人？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I want to understand the people who come through this building. Are they mostly Canadian or are they American?

</details>

**罗谢尔·布什**: 来这里参观塞勒姆教堂的大多数人是美国人。但今年夏天我们看到人数有所下降，仅仅是因为美国发生的事情。关税导致人们失去工作岗位。所以人数有所下降。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rochelle Bush**: So the majority of people that come and take the tour here at Salem Chapel are Americans. But we've seen a decline for that this past summer only because of what's taking place in the United States. With the tariffs, people losing their employment positions. So there has been a decline.

</details>

**主持人**: 这是否让您担心，像这样的历史意义重大的地方能否保持开放？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Does that scare you in terms of keeping some a place like this with historical significance open?

</details>

**罗谢尔·布什**: 是的，这让我担心，因为像许多这样的地方一样，我们依赖美国游客的美元。所以如果这是一个遗产地或文化地，你希望有美国游客，因为他们可能每五年才来一次，但他们会大量来访。当我说的数量大时，我指的是可能来自密苏里州的十个团体，可能来自南卡罗来纳州的十个团体，而如果是加拿大人，我们可能每五年才有一辆来自多伦多的旅游巴士。所以对加拿大人来说，来自安大略湖地区的人来说，这只是他们的一次短途旅行。很多人会来这里，但他们也在前往尼亚加拉瀑布的路上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rochelle Bush**: Yes, it does scare me only because we rely on American tourism dollars as a lot of these sites do. So if it's a heritage site or a cultural site, you want U.S. tourism dollars because they're going to visit maybe once every five years, but they're going to visit in large numbers. And when I say large numbers, I mean maybe ten groups from Missouri, maybe ten from South Carolina, whereas if it's Canadian, we may get a motorcoach group coming from Toronto once every five years. So for Canadians, those coming from, say, the Owen Sound area, it's a one tank trip for them. A lot will come here, but then they're on their way to Niagara Falls as well.

</details>

**主持人**: 话虽如此，您开始看到一股加拿大人涌入，特别是高中生。我想知道学生们离开这里时，他们会带走什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: With that being said, you are starting to see an influx of Canadians, particularly high school students. I want to know when students leave this place.

</details>

**罗谢尔·布什**: 哈里特·塔布曼。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rochelle Bush**: Harriet Tubman.

</details>

**主持人**: 塞勒姆教堂最重要的一点。您希望他们带走什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: The most of Salem Chapel. What's one thing you want them to take with.

</details>

**罗谢尔·布什**: 学生们离开塞勒姆教堂时？我希望他们明白，早期黑人加拿大人，从我们抵达开始，在这个地区我们看到的是1780年，他们为这个伟大国家的建设或发展做出了贡献。我们都知道它被从历史书中抹去了。所以很多人甚至不知道我们的存在。不仅仅是黑人加拿大人，还有其他族裔群体。但这就是我们希望带走的东西，我们对这个国家有多重要以及我们的价值。当然。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rochelle Bush**: Them when the students leave Salem Chapel? I want them to understand that black Canadians so early, black Canadians beginning from our arrival and in this area we're looking at 1780, helped contribute to the construction or the development of Canada of this great nation. And we all know it were written out of the history books. So a lot of people don't even know about our existence. And not just black Canadians, other ethnic groups as well. But that's what we want to take away, to be how important we are to this country and our value. Of course.

</details>

**主持人**: 罗谢尔，您很清楚您对此充满热情，即使谈论您的家庭联系也会让您眼中含泪。您为什么做您所做的事情？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Rochelle is very clear that you're very passionate about this, even just talking about your family connection tears in your eyes a little bit. Why do you do what you do?

</details>

**罗谢尔·布什**: 我做我所做的事情是为了让历史活下去，因为如果这里没有人来做这件事，而且我不会撒谎，好吧，我会直言不讳，如果我不在了，或者没有其他黑人来做这件事，他们了解并以老一辈的方式理解我们的历史，而不是由别人来讲述我们的故事。它就会变成白人的叙事，或者变成别人的叙事。这就是悲哀的部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rochelle Bush**: I do what I do to keep the history alive, because if there's nobody here to do it and I'm not going to lie, okay, I'm going to put it right out on the table if I'm not here to do it, or no other black folks are here to do it that know and understand our history from an old guard way than who's telling our story. It becomes a white narrative, or it becomes someone else's narrative. So that's the sad part.

</details>

**主持人**: 罗谢尔，非常感谢您。非常感谢您的时间。

Some of the main concerns are around the support offices, the family support and student offices, how they're going to run, what they're going to look like.
