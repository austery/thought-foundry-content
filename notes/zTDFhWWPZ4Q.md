title: 阿梅利亚·埃尔哈特失踪之谜：物理、导航与沟通的致命交织
---

### 序言：一场注定的悲剧？

1937年7月2日，当太阳升起时，阿梅利亚·埃尔哈特（Amelia Earhart: 美国著名女飞行员，首位独自飞越大西洋的女性）深知自己陷入了困境。她通过无线电呼叫：“我们一定就在你们上方，但看不到你们。燃油快耗尽了。无法通过无线电联系到你们。我们正以1000英尺的高度飞行。”在她下方，四面八方都是一望无际的海洋。

<details>

<p class="english-text">As the sun rose on July 2nd, 1937, Amelia Earhart knew she was in trouble. Over the radio, she called, "We must be on you but cannot see you. Gas is running low. Been unable to reach you by radio. We are flying at 1,000 feet." Beneath her was water in every direction as far as the eye could see.</p>
</details>

她之所以陷入这种困境，是由于一系列不幸事件和糟糕的决定。其中许多本可以通过更好地了解物理学来避免。但即便如此，在那一刻她本可以做一件事，一个她本可以拨动的开关，很可能就能挽救她的生命并改变历史。

<details>

<p class="english-text">She got herself into this predicament through a series of unfortunate events and bad decisions. Many of them could have been avoided with a better knowledge of physics. But even so, there was one thing she could have done in this moment, one switch she could have flipped that would likely have saved her life and changed history.</p>
</details>

### 环球飞行：漫长而艰险的旅程

阿梅利亚·埃尔哈特当时正努力成为第一位环球飞行的女飞行员。她曾说：“我希望能为航空事业完成一些真正具有科学价值的事情。”她并没有走任何捷径。其他成功的环球飞行都选择了北方航线，大部分时间都靠近陆地。但埃尔哈特的航线将沿着赤道附近，这将是所有航线中最长的一条。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amelia Earhart was vying to become the first female pilot to fly around the world. "I hope to accomplish something really scientifically worthwhile for aviation." And she wasn't taking any shortcuts. Other successful circumnavigations had followed a northern route, mostly staying close to land. But Earhart's route would be the longest by following a path close to the Equator.</p>
</details>

这意味着她旅程的最后一部分是最艰难的，需要横跨整个太平洋。这次跨洋飞行的起点是新几内亚东侧的城市莱城（Lae）。当时，它是世界上最繁忙的机场之一，是亚洲和澳大利亚交通的枢纽。在一个炎热的七月天上午10点，埃尔哈特驾驶着她的**洛克希德伊莱克特拉**（Lockheed Electra: 一款双引擎全金属单翼飞机）滑下跑道，开始了她最后的飞行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This meant the last part of her journey was the hardest, crossing the full width of the Pacific Ocean. The starting point for this crossing was Lae, a city on the eastern side of New Guinea. At the time, it was one of the world's busiest airports, a hub of traffic from Asia and Australia. At 10:00 a.m. on a hot July day, Earhart piloted her Lockheed Electra down the runway and took off on what would be her final flight.</p>
</details>

太平洋非常巨大，比大西洋还要大得多。如果你从某个角度看地球仪，几乎看不到陆地。问题在于，1937年，大多数飞机最多只能飞行几千公里，所以埃尔哈特移除了飞机上所有不必要的东西。她拆掉了隔音材料以减轻重量，但这使得引擎噪音如此巨大，她不得不通过书面笔记与坐在旁边的领航员沟通。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The Pacific Ocean is huge. It's way bigger than the Atlantic. I mean, if you look at the globe from that side, you see almost no land. The problem was, in 1937, most planes could only fly a maximum of a few thousand kilometers, so Earhart removed everything unnecessary from her plane. She ripped out the insulation to reduce weight, but that made the engine noise so overwhelming she had to communicate with her navigator sitting right beside her using written notes.</p>
</details>

她几乎没有带任何行李，告诉她的丈夫：“多余的衣服和食物只会增加重量和担忧。”她用燃料箱替换了乘客座位，有效地将她的飞机变成了一个“飞行油罐”。但即便如此，伊莱克特拉飞机在完美天气下的最大航程也只有6600到7200公里。这可能刚刚足够从莱城飞到夏威夷，也可能灾难性地短缺。因此，埃尔哈特需要在途中停下来加油。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">She packed almost nothing, telling her husband, "Extra clothes and extra food would have been extra weight and extra worry." She replaced the passenger seats with fuel tanks, effectively turning her plane into a flying gas can. But even so, the Electra's maximum range was between 6,600 and 7,200 kilometers in perfect weather. It could be just enough to reach Hawaii from Lae, or she might come up disastrously short. So Earhart needed a place to stop and refuel along the way.</p>
</details>

现在看来这里似乎没有陆地，但如果你放大地图，就会发现澳大利亚和夏威夷之间有一个小岛。豪兰岛（Howland Island）只有两公里多长，不到一公里宽。美国在1856年的《鸟粪岛法案》（Guano Islands Act: 允许美国公民占领无人居住的鸟粪岛屿）中声称拥有该岛。但在1937年，岛上几乎无人居住，只有少数殖民者。如果它有一个跑道，那将是一个理想的加油地点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, it might seem like there's no land here, but if you zoom in, there is this tiny island halfway between Australia and Hawaii. Howland Island is just over two kilometers long and less than one kilometer wide. The US had claimed it as part of the Guano Islands Act of 1856. But in 1937, it was barely inhabited with just a handful of colonists. It would be an ideal location to refuel, if only it had a runway.</p>
</details>

### 早期的成功与政治斡旋

对埃尔哈特来说幸运的是，在她进行环球飞行时，她已经声名鹊起。1928年，她成为第一位乘坐飞机横渡大西洋的女性乘客。这使她成为国际名人。她曾说她希望能亲自驾驶，并表示“也许有一天我会独自尝试”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Fortunately for Earhart, by the time of her around the world flight, she was already famous. In 1928, she became the first female passenger to cross the Atlantic by airplane. This made her an international celebrity. But she wanted to fly herself, saying, "Maybe someday I'll try it alone."</p>
</details>

因此，在1932年，她尝试独自驾驶飞机横渡大西洋，飞往巴黎。她只带了一把牙刷、一罐汤和三罐番茄汁。然而，暴风雨、冰雪和浓雾袭击了她的小飞机。排气歧管的一个接缝裂开，引擎的火焰喷射到夜空中。燃油从破裂的油箱中泄漏，流到她的脖子上。14小时后，她降落在北爱尔兰的一片牧场上。她的脸上沾满了油污，一个农场工人甚至分不清她是男是女。他问她是否飞了很远，她回答说：“从美国飞来的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, in 1932, she attempted to pilot a plane solo across the Atlantic heading for Paris. She brought with her only a toothbrush, one container of soup and three cans of tomato juice. But storms, ice, and dense fog battered her small plane. A seam in the exhaust manifold cracked and flames from the engine spewed out into the night. Gas leaked down her neck from a broken tank, and after 14 hours, she landed in a pasture in Northern Ireland. Her face was so covered in grease, a farmhand couldn't tell if she was a man or a woman. He asked if she had flown far. "From America," she replied.</p>
</details>

这些冒险使她进入了有权势人物的圈子，比如第一夫人埃莉诺·罗斯福（Eleanor Roosevelt）。她利用新建立的人脉，游说总统雇佣她的朋友尤金·维达尔（Eugene Vidal）担任商务局局长。维达尔曾向埃尔哈特承诺在豪兰岛修建一条跑道，但在她计划起飞前几个月，繁琐的程序阻碍了进展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">These adventures brought her into the orbits of powerful people, like the First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt. And using her new connections, she lobbied the president to hire her friend, Eugene Vidal, to head the Bureau of Commerce. Vidal had promised Earhart a runway on Howland Island, but red tape stalled progress only months before her planned takeoff.</p>
</details>

于是埃尔哈特直接写信给罗斯福总统。她解释说，机场跑道的资金需要立即批准，写道：“请原谅这个麻烦的女飞行员，豪兰岛项目对她的环球飞行尝试至关重要。”总统在四天后批准了该项目，很快清理出了三条跑道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Earhart wrote directly to President Roosevelt. She explained that the airstrip funds required immediate approval, writing, "Please forgive troublesome female flyer for whom this Howland Island project is key to world flight attempt." The president approved the project four days later, and three runways were soon cleared.</p>
</details>

### 导航的挑战：如何找到茫茫大海中的小岛？

所以她有了一个降落的地方，但她如何在茫茫大海中找到这个小岛呢？与她一同乘坐伊莱克特拉飞机的是她的领航员弗雷德·努南（Fred Noonan），他负责计算飞行计划。他们知道豪兰岛的方向，所以可以使用机载罗盘设定航向。他们知道空速，可以通过减去或加上风速来计算地速，然后就能估算出到达岛屿所需的时间。这种方法被称为**航位推算**（Dead Reckoning: 通过已知起点、速度和航向来估算当前位置的导航方法）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So she had a place to land, but how would she find this tiny speck of an island in a vast ocean? Well, flying with her in the Electra was her navigator, Fred Noonan, and he would calculate the flight plan. They knew the direction of Howland, so they could use the onboard compass to set their bearing toward it. They knew their air speed and could figure out their ground speed by subtracting or adding the wind, and then they could calculate how long it should take to reach the island. This method is known as dead reckoning.</p>
</details>

但他们不会直接瞄准岛屿，因为如果那样做，在预定时间没有看到岛屿，他们就不知道自己偏离了哪个方向。所以他们故意选择了一个在岛屿北方或南方的一个点。假设他们选择了南方。他们估计行程需要18小时，所以他们将昼夜飞行。一旦他们飞行了计算出的时间长度，他们就可以自信地转向北方并发现岛屿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But they wouldn't aim directly at the island, because if they did that and they didn't see it at the prescribed time, they wouldn't know in which direction they were off. So instead, they intentionally picked a point either north or south of the island. Let's say they picked south. They estimated the trip would take 18 hours, so they would fly through day and night. And once they had traveled for the calculated length of time, they could confidently turn north and spot the island.</p>
</details>

起飞前，地勤人员估计他们会遇到每小时24公里的逆风。但起飞仅20分钟后，莱城通过无线电警告埃尔哈特，逆风会更强。她没有确认收到消息。知道正确的风速至关重要，因为它会影响到达岛屿所需的时间。如果时间更长，埃尔哈特就必须更晚转向。所以她不能仅仅依靠航位推算来抵达豪兰岛。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Before takeoff, the ground crew estimated they would encounter a headwind of 24 kilometers per hour. But just 20 minutes after takeoff, Lae radioed Earhart to warn that the headwinds would be stronger. She didn't acknowledge their message. Knowing the correct wind speed was critical because it would affect how long it would take to reach the island. If it took longer, Earhart would have to turn later. So she couldn't rely on dead reckoning alone to reach Howland.</p>
</details>

作为对他们位置的独立检查，努南会测量太阳、月亮和星星。这被称为**天文导航**（Celestial Navigation: 通过观测天体位置来确定自身位置的导航方法）。他有一本年鉴，列出了58颗导航星以及每颗星在测量当天和时间直接位于地球上方的点。如果他们发现自己正好在一颗导航星下方，那么他们就能立即知道自己的位置。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As an independent check on their location, Noonan would take measurements of the sun, moon, and stars. This is known as celestial navigation. He had an almanac that listed 58 navigation stars and the point on Earth each one would be directly overhead for the day and time of his measurement. If they found themselves directly under a navigation star, well, then they would immediately know their position.</p>
</details>

但通常他们不会那么幸运，所以努南会测量导航星在地平线上方的角度，并用此来计算他们距离地球上该星正上方点的距离。这样他就可以在地球仪上描绘出一个可能的圆形位置，然后他会测量另一颗导航星的角度并画出第二个圆形。现在他们一定在这两个圆形交点中的一个位置。通常圆形非常大，只有一个交点是合理的位置。这样他们就可以不断更新自己的位置并根据需要调整航向。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But generally they would not be that lucky, so Noonan would measure the angle above the horizon to a navigation star and use that to work out how far away they were from the point on the Earth where that star would be directly overhead. So he could trace out a circle on the globe of possible locations, and then he would measure the angle to another navigation star and draw out a second circle. And now they must be at one of these two circle intersections. Normally the circles were so large that only one of the intersections would be a plausible position. That way they could continually update their location and adjust bearings as needed.</p>
</details>

但即使有天文导航，长途飞行中也可能累积误差。旅程早期，当埃尔哈特横渡大西洋时，他们在雾霾条件下错过了预定机场。努南的计算是合理的，但小误差使他们偏离了航线。幸运的是，在非洲，有许多其他地方可以安全降落。但豪兰岛的情况并非如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But even with celestial navigation, errors could accumulate over long trips. Earlier in the journey, when Earhart crossed the Atlantic, they missed their intended airport in hazy conditions. Noonan's calculations were reasonable, but small errors put them off course. Luckily, in Africa, there were plenty of other places to land safely. The same could not be said for Howland.</p>
</details>

因此，为了跨越太平洋的飞行，埃尔哈特征用了三艘美国海军和海岸警卫队船只。“伊塔斯卡号”（Itasca）将驻扎在豪兰岛，“安大略号”（Ontario）将位于航线中途，而“天鹅号”（Swan）则位于豪兰岛和夏威夷之间。当埃尔哈特接近时，伊塔斯卡号会发出烟雾信号，帮助她发现岛屿。但更重要的是，所有船只都配备了无线电设备。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, for the flight across the Pacific, Earhart commandeered three US Navy and Coast Guard ships. The Itasca would be stationed at Howland Island, the Ontario would be halfway along the route, and the Swan was positioned midway between Howland and Hawaii. The Itasca would send out smoke signals as Earhart approached to help her spot the island. But even more importantly, all ships were equipped with radio.</p>
</details>

### 无线电的科学原理与应用

在1937年，无线电仍然是相对较新的技术。德国物理学家海因里希·赫兹（Heinrich Hertz: 发现电磁波并证明其存在）在19世纪80年代末发现了无线电波。他使发射器中的电子来回振荡，几米外的接收器是一个带有小间隙的线圈。当赫兹在黑暗中通过显微镜观察时，他看到了微弱的火花在间隙中跳跃。当接收线圈平放时，火花最强。如果它是垂直的，则没有观察到火花。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, in 1937, radio was still fairly new tech. German physicist Heinrich Hertz discovered radio waves in the late 1880s. He excited electrons to oscillate back and forth in his transmitter, and a few meters away his receiver was a loop of wire with a small gap in it. When Hertz looked at it through a microscope in the dark, he saw faint sparks jumping across the gap. The sparks were strongest when the receiving loop was flat. If it was vertical, then no sparks were observed.</p>
</details>

这表明无线电波是**横波**（Transverse Waves: 振动方向与波的传播方向垂直的波），其电场和磁场相互垂直振荡，并垂直于波的传播方向。当接收线圈与波的传播方向对齐时，通过线圈变化的磁场会产生**电动势**（EMF: Electromotive Force，驱动电流的电势差），从而产生火花。但如果线圈面向发射器，则通过线圈的磁通量没有变化，因此没有观察到火花。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This demonstrated that radio waves are transverse waves with electric and magnetic fields oscillating perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the direction of the wave motion. When the receiving loop was aligned with the direction the wave was traveling, the changing magnetic field through the loop induced an EMF that created the spark. But if the loop was facing the transmitter, then there was no change in magnetic flux through the loop, and so no spark was observed.</p>
</details>

赫兹当时无法预见他所开创的未来。他说：“我不认为我发现的无线电波会有任何实际应用。”但几年之内，人们开始使用无线电发送信息。到20世纪20年代，无线电娱乐广播开始兴起。船舶和飞机普遍使用无线电发送**摩尔斯电码**（Morse Code: 一种通过点和划来表示字母和数字的编码方式），包括埃尔哈特在内的一些人甚至可以发送和接收语音信息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, Hertz couldn't see the future he had ushered in. He said, "I do not think that the wireless waves I have discovered will have any practical application." But within a few years, people started sending messages using radio. And by the 1920s, radio entertainment broadcast took off. Ships and planes routinely used radio to send Morse code, and some, including Earhart, could send and receive voice messages.</p>
</details>

事实上，埃尔哈特的飞机周围有五根无线电天线，每根都有特定的用途。最大的天线可以像钓鱼线一样在飞机后面收放。它长达76米，这对于通过船舶和远程站使用的400或500**千赫兹**（Kilohertz: 频率单位，1千赫兹等于每秒1000次循环）无线电波高效发送和接收摩尔斯电码是必要的。理想情况下，天线的长度应至少为它发射或接收的无线电波波长的1/4。这可以提高电能转换为辐射电磁能的效率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In fact, Earhart had five radio antennas around the plane, each for a specific purpose. The largest antenna could be reeled in and out like a fishing line behind the plane. It was 76 meters long, which was necessary to efficiently send and receive Morse code via the 4 or 500 kilohertz radio waves used by ships and remote stations. Ideally, an antenna should be at least 1/4 of the wavelength of the radio wave it's transmitting or receiving. This improves the efficiency of the conversion from electrical energy to radiated electromagnetic energy.</p>
</details>

埃尔哈特的拖曳天线只有波长的大约1/8。但它连接到一个高功率发射器，所以它的信号仍然可以在1000公里外被检测到。接下来是两根用于更高频率语音通信的天线：一根在飞机顶部的发射V形天线和一根沿机腹的接收天线。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Earhart's trailing antenna was only around 1/8 of the wavelength. But it was connected to a high-power transmitter, so its signals could still be detected over 1,000 kilometers away. Next were two antennas for voice communications on higher frequencies. A transmitting V antenna on the roof of the plane and a receiving antenna along its belly.</p>
</details>

使用更高频率有两个原因。首先，它们需要更小的天线，这可以节省重量，并且更容易安装在小型稀疏的飞机上。其次，高频无线电波可以通过从大气层中一个叫做**电离层**（Ionosphere: 地球大气层中被太阳辐射电离的部分，能反射无线电波）的层反射来传播很长的距离。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Higher frequencies were useful for two reasons. First, they require smaller antennas, which save weight and can be better accommodated on small sparse planes. And second, high frequency radio waves can travel long distances by bouncing off a layer of the atmosphere called the ionosphere.</p>
</details>

从地球表面上方约50公里处开始，太阳辐射将电子从分子中分离出来，形成一层离子和自由电子。特定频率的无线电波与这些自由电子相互作用，并有效地反射回地球。这就像它们从空中一个巨大晃动的镜子反弹回来一样。这种效应被称为“跳跃”（skipping），它会将无线电波散射到各个地方。这些无线电波可以从海洋反射，再从电离层反射，进行多次跳跃，传播数千公里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Starting about 50 kilometers above Earth's surface, radiation from the Sun splits electrons off molecules forming a layer of ions and free electrons. Radio waves with certain frequencies interact with these free electrons and are effectively reflected back to Earth. It's as if they've bounced off a big wobbly mirror in the sky. This effect is called skipping and it scatters radio waves all over the place. These radio waves can then reflect off the ocean and back off the ionosphere, making multiple hops to travel thousands of kilometers.</p>
</details>

白天，强烈的太阳辐射意味着电离层在更密集的较低大气层中开始。因此，较低频率的无线电波更容易被吸收而不是反射。所以飞行员通常会在白天使用较高的6210千赫兹频率来跳跃信号，然后在夜间电离层底部上升到稀薄空气中后，使用较低的3105千赫兹频率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">During the daytime, the intense radiation from the sun means the ionosphere starts lower in denser atmosphere. And because of this, lower frequency radio waves are more likely to be absorbed than reflected. So aviators would typically use the higher 6210 kilohertz to skip their signals during the day, and then the lower 3105 kilohertz at night once the bottom of the ionosphere had lifted into thinner air.</p>
</details>

### 沟通中断：一系列的误解与技术故障

起飞四小时后，埃尔哈特通过她白天的6210频率向莱城发出了更新。她报告了7000英尺的高度和140节的速度，最后以她典型的结束语“一切正常”结束。但她从未确认收到莱城关于逆风的呼叫。他们在11:20和12:20再次通过无线电呼叫，但从未收到埃尔哈特的回复。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Four hours after takeoff, Earhart radioed an update to Lae on her daytime frequency of 6210. She reported her altitude at 7,000 feet and speed at 140 knots before concluding with her typical sign-off, "Everything okay." But she never acknowledged calls from Lae about the headwind. They radioed again at 11:20 and 12:20, but never got a response from Earhart.</p>
</details>

很可能她根本没有听到。她在飞行六小时后确实通过无线电报告了更强的逆风，但她没有提及莱城早前的警告。可能是接收机腹天线损坏、脱落，或者接收电子设备出了问题。但她接收语音信息的能力显然受损了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In all likelihood, she never heard them. She did radio six hours into her flight to report stronger headwinds, but she makes no mention of Lae's earlier warnings. It's possible the receiving belly antenna was broken, fell off, or something in the receiving electronics wasn't working. But her ability to receive voice messages was clearly impaired.</p>
</details>

飞行九小时后，埃尔哈特预计会遇到安大略号。她监听400千赫兹的摩尔斯电码“N”，但什么也没听到。最初的计划是安大略号会等待她通过无线电请求他们开始发射。但起飞前一天，埃尔哈特意识到她犯了一个错误。安大略号曾告诉她，他们无法接收任何高频信号，这意味着无法进行语音通信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nine hours into the flight, Earhart expected to come upon the Ontario. She listened for Morse code Ns on 400 kilohertz, but she heard nothing. The original plan was that the Ontario would wait for her to radio them to request that they start transmitting. But the day before takeoff, Earhart realized she had made a mistake. The Ontario had told her they wouldn't be able to receive any high frequency signals, which meant no voice communication.</p>
</details>

所以她发了一封紧急电报，要求安大略号在每小时过10分钟后重复发射摩尔斯电码“N”。安大略号发送摩尔斯电码的目的是让阿梅利亚·埃尔哈特能够利用她的最后两根天线。她有一个像这样的环形天线和一根感应天线。这些天线旨在让她能够定位无线电波的来源。这是埃尔哈特计划保持航向并定位豪兰岛的最后也是最关键的方法。她写道：“如果没有它来辅助弗雷德·努南的技能，我怀疑我不会尝试飞往小小的豪兰岛。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So she sent an urgent telegram asking the Ontario to transmit the Morse code Ns repeatedly 10 minutes after each hour. The purpose of the Morse code from the Ontario was actually to allow Amelia Earhart to make use of her two final antennas. So she had a loop antenna just like this one and a sense antenna. These were designed to allow her to locate the source of radio waves. This was the final and most critical way that Earhart planned to stay on course and locate Howland Island. She wrote, "I doubt if I'd try the flight to tiny Howland Island without it supplementing Fred Noonan's skill."</p>
</details>

### 环形天线与无线电测向

（演示环节）所以安大略号正在通过他们的天线发送摩尔斯电码信号。无线电波会从天线向各个方向径向发射，电场会上下振荡，磁场会来回振荡。如果我像这样举起这个环形天线，使其大致平行于波的传播方向，那么磁场就会穿过环形天线发生变化。因此，它会产生电动势和电流，我可以通过调谐到正确的频率来接收它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the Ontario was sending out Morse code signals on their antenna, and here we have a transmitter tuned to about 3.6 megahertz. I'm gonna put on this blindfold and use the loop antenna to try to locate the transmitter. And because I already know where the transmitter is, we'll spin me around a few times to really disorient me. So the radio waves are gonna be emitted in all directions radially away from the antenna, the electric field will be oscillating up and down, and the magnetic field will be oscillating back and forth. So if I hold up this loop like this sort of parallel to the direction that the waves are traveling, then the magnetic field is gonna be changing through the loop. And because of that, it's going to create an EMF and current and I can pick that up because I'm tuned to the right frequency here.</p>
</details>

我会得到一个相当强的信号。但如果我像那样旋转环形天线，那么磁场会来回振荡，但不会穿过环形天线本身发生变化，因为它与环形天线平行。因此，在这种方向下，我将得到一个**零点**（Null: 信号强度最低或消失的点）读数。如果我把它转到这个方向，就会有一个零点。但如果把它转90度，现在所有的磁场都穿过这个环形天线，所以我能听到最大的信号。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I got a fairly strong signal. Woo, it's very strong. But if I rotate the loop like that, well, now the magnetic field is oscillating back and forth but not changing through the loop itself because it's parallel to the loop. And so, in this orientation, I'm gonna get a null reading. If I turn it this way, there's a null. But if you turn it 90 degrees, now all the magnetic field is passing through this loop and so I can hear a maximum here.</p>
</details>

这就是埃尔哈特想要测量的，她使用她的环形天线来检测安大略号重复发送的摩尔斯电码“N”。她会旋转它直到找到零点，然后她就会知道船的方向。有趣的是，如果我把它转开，我们又会得到另一个零点，因为再次没有磁通量穿过这个环形天线。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So this is what Earhart wanted to measure using her loop antenna to detect the repeated N Morse code from the Ontario. She would turn it until she found the null and then she would know the direction to the ship. Something that's interesting is, if I turn it away, we get another null because again there's no magnetic flux passing through this loop.</p>
</details>

她第一次收到信号时，可能正朝着船的方向前进，或者足够接近，所以她会知道大致的方向。但她也有可能已经飞过了。如果你飞过了，那么你也会得到一个零点，但船在你后面，而不是在你前面。这就是感应天线的作用。感应天线会给你一个心形接收模式，所以它只有一个零点而不是两个零点，这样你就可以确定它是在你前面还是后面。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Now, the first time she picked up the signal, she would probably be heading straight towards the ship or close enough, so she would know that it's roughly that way. But there's a chance that she's gone past it. And if you go past it, well, then you also get a null, but the ship is behind you, not in front of you. So that's where the sense antenna comes in. The sense antenna gives you a cardioid pickup pattern so it has a single null instead of two nulls, and so that allows you to determine whether it is in front or behind you.</p>
</details>

使用感应天线，唯一的零点直接指向发射器，所以很容易使用感应天线来检查哪个零点是正确的，但导航时只使用环形天线，因为它能提供更尖锐的零点。飞行员本可以使用信号最响亮的地方，并尝试朝那个方向前进，但实际上更容易获得精确的零点，即信号消失的点。响亮的部分可能持续很长一段距离，所以你无法真正知道它在哪里，但零点更精确，这就是为什么他们会寻找信号消失的点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">With the sense antenna, the only null points directly away from the transmitter, so it's easy to use the sense antenna to check which null is correct but then only use the loop when navigating because it gives a sharper null. Now, aviators could have used where the signal is loudest and try to go in that direction, but it's actually easier to get a precise null, a point where the signal drops out. The loud section could range for quite a distance and so you wouldn't really know where it is, but the null is more precise so that's why they would look for the point where the signal drops out.</p>

如果埃尔哈特能够使用她的无线电测向环形天线锁定安大略号，那将确保她保持航向，并消除之前可能发生的所有导航误差。但她要求安大略号在每小时过10分钟后发射电报的请求没有及时送达船上。由于埃尔哈特无法与安大略号通话，他们从未发出任何信号。所以他们像夜间的船只一样擦肩而过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If Earhart could hone in on the Ontario using her radio direction finding loop, that would ensure she was on course and eliminate any navigation errors that may have occurred to that point. But her telegram asking the Ontario to transmit 10 minutes after each hour didn't make it to the ship in time. And since Earhart couldn't talk to the Ontario, they never sent out any signals. So they passed like ships in the night.</p>
</details>

### 第一次尝试与机组人员变动

此时，埃尔哈特已经到达豪兰岛大约一半的路程。在1000公里范围内没有其他降落跑道的情况下，她必须找到这个小岛，否则现在就得返回莱城。但多次延误已经困扰了她的旅程。事实上，这并不是埃尔哈特第一次尝试环球飞行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By this point, Earhart was around halfway to Howland. With no other landing strips within 1,000 kilometers, she would have to find the tiny island or return to Lae now. But multiple delays had already plagued her journey. In fact, this was not Earhart's first attempt to fly around the world.</p>
</details>

当年早些时候，1937年3月，她曾从加利福尼亚飞往夏威夷，方向是向西而不是向东。机上载有弗雷德·努南和另一名机组人员哈里·曼宁（Harry Manning）。作为一名商船船长，他是无线电、摩尔斯电码和传统导航方面的专家。他也是一名飞行员。飞往夏威夷的航班成功了，部分原因在于曼宁使用了环形天线来锁定目的地岛屿上的无线电信标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Earlier that year, in March of 1937, she had taken off from California for Hawaii, heading west instead of east. On board were Fred Noonan and another crew member, Harry Manning. As a Merchant Marine captain, he was an expert in radio, Morse code, and traditional navigation. He was also a pilot. The flight to Hawaii was successful thanks in part to Manning using the loop antenna to hone in on a radio beacon on the destination island.</p>
</details>

三天后，三人启程前往豪兰岛。但就在他们起飞时，飞机向右偏离。埃尔哈特通过收回左侧发动机油门进行修正，但用力过猛。飞机向左转，右翼下沉。飞机单轮着地，右起落架塌陷，然后是左起落架。飞机腹部着地滑行，旋转着面对来时的方向。幸运的是，没有人受伤，但伊莱克特拉飞机花了几个月才修复。在此期间，季节性风向发生了变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Three days later, the trio set off for Howland Island. But just as they were taking off, the plane drifted to the right. Earhart corrected by throttling back the left motor, but it was too much. The plane turned to the left and the right wing dipped down. Going up on one wheel, the right landing gear collapsed, then the left. The plane skidded out on its belly, spinning around to face the way it had come. Thankfully, no one was hurt, but the Electra took months to repair.</p>
</details>

所以，在她的下一次尝试中，埃尔哈特不得不向东而不是向西飞行。最重要的是，曼宁船长离开了机组。官方报道称他需要返回商船队，但谣言称他失去了对埃尔哈特的信心，或者埃尔哈特认为努南比曼宁更优秀的领航员，而且她可以独自操作无线电。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And during that time, the seasonal winds shifted. So, on her next attempt, Earhart would have to fly east instead of west. And most importantly, Captain Manning left the crew. Officially, the press reported that he needed to return to the Merchant Marines, but rumors spread that he had lost confidence in Earhart, or that Earhart believed Noonan was a better navigator than Manning and she could operate the radio on her own.</p>
</details>

无论如何，三个月后埃尔哈特再次起飞时，只有努南陪同。现在他们已经完成了环球飞行80%的路程。在漆黑的夜晚，埃尔哈特必须做出关键决定：是继续前进还是折返。安大略号没有信号一定令人担忧，但也许他们从未收到她的电报。她知道在豪兰岛，伊塔斯卡号会每半小时通过摩尔斯电码发射字母“A”，即使他们没有收到她的消息。而且他们可以发送和接收语音信号。他们承诺会在一系列不同频率上做好准备。所以她继续飞行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Whatever the case, when Earhart took off again three months later, she was accompanied only by Noonan. And now they had made it 80% of the way around the world. And in the dark of night, Earhart had to make the critical decision whether to keep going or turn back. The lack of signal from the Ontario must have been concerning, but maybe they never got her telegram. And she knew that at Howland, the Itasca would be transmitting the letter A over Morse code every half hour, even if they didn't hear from her. And they could send and receive voice signals. They promised to be ready on a range of different frequencies. So she flew on.</p>
</details>

### 豪兰岛的最后尝试：混乱与绝望

当地时间上午6:15左右，伊塔斯卡号上的无线电操作员清楚地听到了埃尔哈特的声音。“请在3105频率上测向。我们将对着麦克风吹口哨。我们大约在200英里外。”然后她开始吹口哨。但船员们感到困惑。他们期望埃尔哈特对他们进行测向，而不是反过来。虽然他们曾告诉她有无线电测向设备，但信号需要是较低频率，介于270到550千赫兹之间。她的语音频率会从电离层跳跃并从海洋反射，向各个方向散射。所以根本无法找到零点，因为信号实际上会从四面八方传来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Around 6:15 a.m. local time, radiomen aboard the Itasca heard Earhart clearly. "Please take a bearing on 3105. We'll whistle into the mic. We are about 200 miles out." She then began to whistle. But the men were confused. They expected Earhart to take a bearing on them, not the other way around. And while they had told her that they had radio direction finding equipment, the signal needed to be lower frequency, between 270 and 550 kilohertz. Her voice frequency would skip off the ionosphere and reflect off the ocean, scattering in all directions. So there would be no way to find a null because the signal would be coming literally from everywhere.</p>
</details>

在伊莱克特拉飞机上，埃尔哈特只听到了静电噪音。此时，她一定很担心，因为她没有收到任何一艘船的任何消息。被初升的太阳几乎弄瞎，被引擎的轰鸣声震聋，埃尔哈特扭动着无线电拨盘，等待伊塔斯卡号的回复。什么也没有。她可能期望豪兰岛有一个高频无线电测向仪，称为**阿德科克天线阵列**（Adcock Antenna Array: 一种用于高频无线电测向的天线系统）。这些系统通过在正方形的角和中心设置五个垂直天线，解决了跳跃问题。无线电波的方向可以根据每个天线略微不同的到达时间和信号强度来计算。但这些天线非常巨大，所以通常只安装在大型机场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the Electra, Earhart heard only static. By now, she must have been worried that they hadn't heard anything from either ship. Almost blind from the rising sun and deaf from the roar of the engines, Earhart twisted the radio dial, listening for Itasca's response. Nothing. She may have expected Howland to have a high frequency radio direction finder called an Adcock antenna array. These systems solve the skipping problem with five vertical antennas at the corners and center of a square. The direction of the radio wave can be calculated from the slightly different arrival times and signal strengths at each antenna. But these antennas were massive, so they were really only installed at larger airports.</p>
</details>

碰巧的是，豪兰岛上确实有一个便携式高频无线电测向仪，但操作员报告说，埃尔哈特的传输时间不够长，无法让他进行测向。为了节省低电量的电池，他错过了后来传输的部分内容。大约6:45，埃尔哈特再次要求他们在3105千赫兹频率上进行测向，并在半小时后回复。但现在测向并在半小时后回复，充其量是过时的，最坏的情况是误导性的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, as it happens, there was a portable high frequency radio direction finder on Howland Island, but the operator reported that Earhart's transmissions didn't last long enough for him to take a bearing. And trying to conserve his low battery, he missed parts of the later transmissions. Around 6:45, Earhart again asked them to take a bearing on 3105 kilohertz and report back in a half hour. But a bearing taken now and reported back in a half hour would be at best outdated and at worst misleading.</p>
</details>

这种混乱很可能与时区有关。埃尔哈特使用的是格林威治民用时间（Greenwich Civil Time, GCT），但伊塔斯卡号将他们的时钟设置为他们当前的位置，即GCT-11.5小时。更糟糕的是，豪兰岛使用的是夏威夷时间，在当时是GCT-10.5小时。因此，三方试图在太平洋中部的一个小岛上会合，却处于三个不同的时区。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This confusion likely had to do with time zones. Earhart was using Greenwich Civil Time, but the Itasca set their clocks to their current position which was GCT -11.5 hours. And to make matters worse, Howland Island used Hawaii Time, which back in those days was GCT -10.5 hours. So the three parties attempting a rendezvous on a tiny island in the middle of the Pacific were on three different time zones.</p>
</details>

关键是，埃尔哈特的时间甚至没有与其他方对齐。埃尔哈特告诉伊塔斯卡号她将使用GCT，但不知何故，这个信息从未传达给无线电操作员。所以，当伊塔斯卡号听到埃尔哈特的请求时，是上午6:45。但在驾驶舱里，却是下午6:15。所以埃尔哈特很可能不是说“半小时后”，而是说“在半点时”，这对她来说只有15分钟了。而且这也是埃尔哈特预先安排好监听他们的时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And crucially, Earhart's hours didn't even line up with the others. Earhart told the Itasca she would be using GCT, but somehow it never made it to the radiomen. So, when the Itasca heard Earhart's request, it was 6:45 a.m. But in the cockpit, it was 6:15 p.m. So Earhart likely didn't say "in a half hour" but "on the half hour," which for her was only 15 minutes away. And also it was a prearranged time that Earhart would be listening for them.</p>
</details>

埃尔哈特小心翼翼地设定了她发射和监听船只的时间，因为她一次只能给一根天线供电。而船只使用相同的天线进行接收和发射，所以如果他们同时广播，他们就会错过彼此的消息。如果埃尔哈特在过一刻钟后发送另一条消息，伊塔斯卡号会用他们自己的消息将其阻断。“无法很好地在3105频率上测向。请在500频率上发送，或者您希望对我们进行测向？请继续。”没有回复。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Earhart was careful to set times she would transmit and times she would listen for the ship because she could only power one antenna at a time. And the ships used the same antenna for receiving and transmitting, so if they both broadcasted at the same time, they would miss each other's messages. If Earhart sent another message at a quarter after the hour, the Itasca blocked it with their own message. "Cannot take a bearing on 3105 very good. Please send on 500, or do you wish to take a bearing on us? Go ahead please." There was no response.</p>
</details>

但她无论如何也无法在500千赫兹频率上发射，因为她已经移除了可以发射低频的长拖曳天线。由于它只能用于摩尔斯电码，而她和努南都不太精通，所以在曼宁离开后，她认为它是死重。因此，在夏威夷坠机后，它在维修期间被移除了。所以她无法发送无线电波，让伊塔斯卡号对她进行测向。但她可以使用她的环形天线对伊塔斯卡号进行测向，如果他们给她发送正确的频率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But she couldn't transmit on 500 kilohertz anyway because she had removed the long trailing antenna that could transmit lower frequencies. Since it could only be used for Morse code, something neither she nor Noonan were particularly well versed in, she saw it as dead weight after Manning left. So, after the Hawaii crash, it was removed during repairs. So she had no way of sending radio waves that would allow the Itasca to take a bearing on her. But she could take a bearing on the Itasca using her loop antenna, if they sent her the right frequency.</p>
</details>

旅行前，伊塔斯卡号曾要求埃尔哈特指定他们应该广播的频率。埃尔哈特不确定，所以她咨询了莱城的一位无线电专家，他们建议伊塔斯卡号在半点时以750频率发送摩尔斯电码“A”，即重复的点划。但在当时，通常用波长来谈论无线电波，所以专家指的是750米或400千赫兹。但埃尔哈特在向伊塔斯卡号转达这个计划时犯了一个可怕的错误。她要求信号以7500**兆赫兹**（Megahertz: 频率单位，1兆赫兹等于每秒100万次循环）而不是750米或400千赫兹发送。但她明确表示：“如果提及的频率不合适，请通知我。”但没有人纠正她。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Before the trip, the Itasca had asked Earhart to specify the frequency they should broadcast. Earhart was unsure, so she consulted a radio expert in Lae and they recommended the Itasca send Morse code A, just repeated dot dashes, on the half hour at 750. But at that time it was typical to talk about radio waves using their wavelength, so the expert had meant 750 meters or 400 kilohertz. But Earhart made a terrible mistake relaying this plan to the Itasca. She requested the signal be sent on 7,500 kilohertz instead of 750 meters or 400 kilohertz. But she did explicitly say, "If frequencies mentioned unsuitable, inform me." But no one ever corrected her.</p>
</details>

上午7:42，埃尔哈特的声音非常响亮，船员们甚至走到甲板上，看看是否能听到引擎声或发现飞机。她说：“我们一定就在你们上方，但看不到你们。燃油快耗尽了。无法通过无线电联系到你们。我们正以1000英尺的高度飞行。”在豪兰岛，高频无线电测向仪的电池电量太低，无线电操作员甚至没有听到埃尔哈特的消息，更不用说对其进行测向了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At 7:42 a.m., Earhart's voice came through so loud men even went above deck to see if they could hear a motor or spot the plane. She said, "We must be on you but cannot see you. But gas is running low. Been unable to reach you by radio. We are flying at 1,000 feet." On Howland, the high frequency radio direction finder was so low on battery the radiomen didn't even hear Earhart's message, much less take a bearing on it.</p>
</details>

10分钟后，埃尔哈特说：“我们正在盘旋，但听不到你们。请在7500频率上继续。”伊塔斯卡号立即在7500千赫兹频率上发送了“A”信号。在伊莱克特拉飞机上，埃尔哈特听到了“A”信号断断续续地充满了机舱。终于听到声音的解脱感一定是巨大的。她迅速转动她的无线电测向环形天线以定位零点，但信号从未消失。频率太高了，所以来自伊塔斯卡号的无线电波正在反射并从不同方向到达。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">10 minutes later, Earhart said, "We are circling but cannot hear you. Go ahead on 7,500." The Itasca immediately sent As on 7,500 kilohertz. In the Electra, Earhart heard the stutter stop of As filling the cabin. The relief of finally hearing something must have been overwhelming. She quickly turned her radio direction finding loop to locate the null, but the signal never dropped out. The frequency was too high, so the radio waves from the Itasca were reflecting and arriving from different directions.</p>
</details>

约瑟夫·格尔（Joseph Gurr），一位曾为埃尔哈特飞机工作的无线电技师，后来表示他们知道高频无线电波的局限性，它们有跳跃和弯曲的趋势，会产生错误的无线电测向。没有零点，她仍然迷失了方向。埃尔哈特焦急地呼叫伊塔斯卡号。“我们收到了你们的信号，但无法获得零点。请对我们进行测向并用语音回复。”伊塔斯卡号试图解释问题。“你们的信号接收正常。对你们的语音进行测向是不切实际的。”没有回复。没有机腹天线，她可能从未听到他们的任何通信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Joseph Gurr, a radio mechanic who worked on Earhart's plane, later said that they knew there were limitations to high frequencies which had a tendency to skip and bend, creating a false radio direction bearing. Without a minimum, she was still lost. Earhart frantically called Itasca. "We received your signals but unable to get a minimum. Please take a bearing on us and answer with voice." Itasca attempted to explain the problem. "Your signals received okay. It is impractical to take a bearing on your voice." No response. Without the belly antenna, she probably never heard any of their communications.</p>
</details>

即使伊塔斯卡号发送了低频信号也无济于事，因为埃尔哈特的环形天线是调谐到接收7500千赫兹的。那么，为什么伊塔斯卡号没有纠正她建议的频率呢？伊塔斯卡号指挥官汤普森（Commander Thompson）知道她的无线电测向限制。他收到了来自埃尔哈特丈夫乔治·普特南（George Putnam）和海岸警卫队旧金山分部的消息，说明埃尔哈特只能在200到1500千赫兹之间的频率上进行测向。但他要么认为埃尔哈特更了解她的无线电设备，要么认为他不应该提出建议并对她的飞行承担更多责任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it wouldn't have mattered if the Itasca had sent low frequency signals because Earhart's loop was tuned to pick up 7,500 kilohertz. So, why didn't the Itasca correct the frequency she suggested? Commander Thompson of the Itasca was aware of her radio direction finding limits. He had received messages both from Earhart's husband, George Putnam, and the Coast Guard's San Francisco division stating Earhart could only take bearings on frequencies between 200 and 1,500 kilohertz. But he either thought Earhart knew more about her radio equipment, or that it wasn't his place to make suggestions and take more responsibility for her flight.</p>
</details>

当她要求伊塔斯卡号告知她这些频率是否不合适时，她可能指的是船只的能力而不是她自己的能力。伊塔斯卡号表示他们会在她想要的频率以及更多频率上做好准备，而不是给出具体的建议。旧金山海岸警卫队分部试图让汤普森指挥官对埃尔哈特的无线电通信承担更多责任，建议他们直接告诉埃尔哈特使用哪些频率。但汤普森基本上告诉他们不要干涉。此后，伊塔斯卡号直接与埃尔哈特通信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When she asked the Itasca to tell her if these frequencies weren't suitable, she could have been referring to the ship's capabilities rather than her own. The Itasca said they'd be ready on the frequencies she wanted and more instead of giving specific suggestions. San Francisco's Coast Guard division tried to get Commander Thompson to take more responsibility for Earhart's radio communications by suggesting they directly tell Earhart which frequencies to use. But Thompson essentially told them to butt out. The Itasca communicated directly with Earhart from then on.</p>
</details>

无线电操作员继续尝试联系埃尔哈特，就在上午9:00之前，埃尔哈特的声音再次突然传来。“我们在线路157-337上。我们将在6210千赫兹上重复此消息。我们正在南北方向飞行。”她的声音充满绝望。听起来她快要哭出来或尖叫了。这是伊塔斯卡号听到的最后一条消息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The radiomen continued to try to reach Earhart, and just before 9:00 a.m., Earhart's voice suddenly burst through again. "We are on the line 157-337. We will repeat this on 6,210 kilohertz. We are running on line north and south." Her voice was desperate. It sounded as if she was about to burst into tears or scream. This was the last message the Itasca heard.</p>
</details>

### 最后的结局与经验教训

关于埃尔哈特之后发生了什么的阴谋论有很多，但证据似乎很清楚。她在太平洋上某个地方燃油耗尽，坠入大海。在她最后一条消息发出两小时后，伊塔斯卡号离开了豪兰岛，向北和向西搜寻伊莱克特拉飞机。其他海军和海岸警卫队的船只和飞机也加入了搜寻，持续了两个多星期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There are a number of conspiracy theories about what happened to Earhart after that, but the evidence seems clear. She ran out of fuel somewhere over the Pacific and crashed into the sea. Two hours after her last message, the Itasca left Howland to search north and west for the Electra. Other Navy and Coast Guard ships and planes joined the search for over two weeks.</p>
</details>

在当时的美国历史上，这是最密集和最昂贵的搜救行动，耗资约400万美元，按今天的货币计算接近1亿美元。没有人找到努南、埃尔哈特或她的伊莱克特拉飞机的任何痕迹。如果埃尔哈特有双向通信，所有这些错误本可以得到解决，但她的机腹天线不知何故出了故障。一些理论认为它在新几内亚起飞时脱落了，但没有物证，无法断定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">To that point in US history, it was the most intensive and expensive search and rescue operation, costing around $4 million, which is almost 100 million in today's money. No one has ever found a trace of Noonan, Earhart, or her Electra. All of these mistakes could have been resolved if Earhart had two-way communication, but her belly antenna somehow malfunctioned. Some theories suggest it fell off during takeoff in New Guinea, but without physical evidence, it's impossible to say.</p>
</details>

但埃尔哈特确实确认她的环形天线收到了信号。她的环形天线只能在较低频率下进行测向，但可以在很宽的范围内接收信号。如果她将环形天线用于所有通信，她本可以收到伊塔斯卡号的语音消息，然后伊塔斯卡号可以要求她在较低频率上进行测向，这将引导她安全抵达豪兰岛。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But Earhart did confirm receiving signals on her loop antenna. Her loop could only direction find with lower frequencies, but it could receive signals on a wide range. If she had switched to using the loop for all communications, she could have received Itasca's voice messages and then the Itasca could have requested she take a bearing on a lower frequency, which would have guided her safely to Howland Island.</p>
</details>

当我开始研究这个视频时，我以为阿梅利亚·埃尔哈特的消亡是不可避免的。她所做的事情是如此困难，以至于没有什么能拯救她。但相反，我发现了截然不同的结果。至少有六件事，如果它们有所不同，本可以让她安全降落。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When I began researching this video, I expected to find that Amelia Earhart's demise was inevitable. That what she was trying to do was just so difficult that nothing could have saved her. But instead, I found the opposite. There were at least a half dozen things that if they went differently would have allowed her to land safely.</p>
</details>

所以对我来说，这个故事归结为两件事：知识和责任。埃尔哈特缺乏无线电系统知识，这本可以让她指定正确的测向频率。但伊塔斯卡号指挥官汤普森拥有这些知识。他知道她的测向限制，但他没有承担起纠正她的责任。在尝试任何具有挑战性的事业时，你需要一个拥有正确知识并且愿意承担责任把事情做好的人。这就是你对抗宇宙固有的混乱和无序所需要的。否则，你将面临灾难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So to me, this story comes down to two things. Knowledge and responsibility. Earhart lacked knowledge of radio systems, which would've allowed her to specify the right direction finding frequency. But Commander Thompson of the Itasca had that knowledge. He knew her direction finding limits, but he didn't take on the responsibility to correct her. When attempting any challenging endeavor, you need someone with the right knowledge who will also take responsibility for getting things right. That's what you need to battle the inherent chaos and disorder of the universe. Otherwise, what you get is disaster.</p>
