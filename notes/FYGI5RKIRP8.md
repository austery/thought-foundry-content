title: 马克思恩格斯：从宗教到“科学”的共产主义转型与批判
---

### 共产主义的早期教主与魏特林的登场

大家好，欢迎收看夸克说，我是夸克。前面两期节目，我们回顾了共产主义早期思想的五位教主。接下来，终于到了我们这个系列的高潮，也是最为大家所熟悉的马克思和恩格斯。但在介绍他俩之前，我们还得插播一位重要人物。上期节目的结尾，我们提到过**密谋社**（Conspiracy of Equals: 早期法国革命团体，主张财产公有）的一个幸存者逃到了瑞士，并将第五代核心巴贝夫的理论整理出版，搞出了一本叫《为平等而密谋》的书。这本书后来流传开来，成了全球共产主义革命者们的圣经。在巴贝夫的众多读者之中，有一个落魄的小裁缝。当他第一次读到这本书时，如遭雷击，书中的那些关于怎么造反的理论，都像是在他那颗充满仇恨却又迷茫的心里点燃了一把火。

<p class="english-text">Hello everyone, welcome to Quark Says, I am Quark. In the previous two episodes, we reviewed the five early leaders of communist thought. Now, we finally reach the climax of this series, featuring the most familiar figures, Marx and Engels. But before introducing them, we need to briefly mention an important person. At the end of the last episode, we talked about a survivor of the **Conspiracy of Equals** who fled to Switzerland and compiled and published the theories of the fifth-generation core leader, Babeuf, in a book called "The Conspiracy of Equals." This book later spread and became a bible for communist revolutionaries worldwide. Among Babeuf's many readers was a down-and-out tailor. When he first read this book, he was struck by lightning; the theories about how to rebel ignited a fire in his heart, which was full of hatred yet confused.</p>
</details>

说来有意思，我们前面提过的二代目，就是那个一年娶了16个老婆的神棍于老师，也是个裁缝。看起来在欧洲，裁缝还真是个危险职业，就跟我们这儿的图书馆管理员一样。说回这个小裁缝，他就是我们的第六位教主威廉·魏特林。你大概没听过他的名字，但他随后干的事，却实实在在对共产主义乃至人类历史产生了重大影响。1836年，裁缝按照巴贝夫梳理的想法，建立起了一个主要由小手艺人组成的地下革命组织。组织的名字很中二，叫**正义者同盟**（League of the Just: 早期国际工人秘密组织）。乍一听，还以为是超人蝙蝠侠呢。这个中二团伙后来改了个名叫**共产主义者同盟**（Communist League: 国际性工人组织，马克思和恩格斯曾为其撰写《共产党宣言》）。再后来，这个共产主义者同盟委托两位德国大胡子写了本书，叫《共产党宣言》。当然，如果仅仅是因为这个，那我们裁缝肯定还到不了教主的位置。它之所以这么重要，是因为以下几点。

<details>

<p class="english-text">It's interesting to note that the second-generation leader we mentioned earlier, the charlatan Teacher Yu who married 16 wives in a year, was also a tailor. It seems that in Europe, tailoring was indeed a dangerous profession, much like being a librarian in our context. Getting back to this tailor, he is our sixth leader, Wilhelm Weitling. You probably haven't heard his name, but what he did next truly had a significant impact on communism and even on human history. In 1836, following Babeuf's ideas, the tailor established an underground revolutionary organization primarily composed of small artisans. The organization's name was quite "chuunibyou" (a Japanese term for a teenager who has delusions of grandeur), called the **League of the Just**. At first glance, one might think of Superman or Batman. This "chuunibyou" group later changed its name to the **Communist League**. Later, this Communist League commissioned two German bearded men to write a book called "The Communist Manifesto." Of course, if it were only for this, our tailor certainly wouldn't have reached the position of a leader. Its significance lies in the following points.</p>
</details>

### 魏特林的宗教化共产主义

第一期我们曾提出过一个问题：共产主义到底是不是宗教？如果说这一点在其他某些教主，比如无神论的梅梅那儿，还有点拿不准的话，那在裁缝这儿可就一点不含糊了。首先，裁缝是把《圣经》当成共产革命说明书的，也就是说，他不是拿《圣经》和共产主义做类比，而是直接认为基督教就是共产主义。他看《圣经》和今天马院的教授们看待《资本论》和《共产党宣言》是一回事。为此，他还按照共产主义的思路，重新注解了《圣经》里的很多记载来佐证自己的观点。比如他认为耶稣是第一个共产主义者，他既是神的儿子，是主，也是政治和经济上的共产主义领袖。他上十字架，跟你从小到大听过的什么江姐、刘胡兰一样，都是被反动派杀害的烈士。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the first episode, we raised a question: Is communism a religion? If this point was somewhat uncertain with some other leaders, like the atheist Maymay, it was absolutely clear with the tailor. First, the tailor regarded "The Bible" as a manual for communist revolution. That is, he didn't just draw analogies between "The Bible" and communism; he directly believed that Christianity *was* communism. His interpretation of "The Bible" was akin to how professors in Marxist academies today view "Das Kapital" and "The Communist Manifesto." To this end, he reinterpreted many accounts in "The Bible" according to communist ideas to support his views. For example, he believed Jesus was the first communist, who was both the Son of God, the Lord, and a political and economic communist leader. His crucifixion, like the stories of Jiang Jie and Liu Hulan you heard growing up, was that of a martyr killed by reactionaries.</p>
</details>

这里多说一句，上世纪70年代，拉美的天主教徒中盛行一种**解放神学**（Liberation Theology: 结合基督教信仰与社会政治解放的思潮），包括什么黑人解放神学、酷儿神学、女性主义神学等等，基本上就是裁缝的思路。在这帮人看来，你马克思算个毛啊，你能代表共产主义吗？你这一摊子都是我们迷人的老祖宗耶稣2000多年前玩剩下的。第二，他认为共产革命之所以会到来，是出于所谓的穷人们神圣的愤怒，而这种愤怒是出于上帝的旨意。既然是上帝的旨意，那也就不需要什么先锋队共产党了，到时候救世主会亲自降临人间当总书记。最后，他布道的手法，包括使用的语言，也完全是基督教式的，因为他相当于本来就在传教嘛，只是换了一种解读。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A side note here: in the 1970s, a kind of **Liberation Theology** became prevalent among Latin American Catholics, including Black liberation theology, queer theology, feminist theology, and so on. These largely followed the tailor's line of thinking. From their perspective, what is Marx? Can you represent communism? All your ideas are just leftovers from our charming ancestor Jesus, who played with them 2000 years ago. Second, he believed that the communist revolution would come about due to the so-called sacred wrath of the poor, and this wrath was God's will. Since it was God's will, there was no need for a vanguard communist party; the savior would personally descend to earth and become the general secretary. Finally, his preaching methods, including the language he used, were entirely Christian, because he was essentially proselytizing, just with a different interpretation.</p>
</details>

### 革命主力之争：魏特林与马克思的对垒

除了这几点，裁缝兄还有个极为独特的创建，为此还跟后面的马教主、恩教主多次连麦互喷，那就是关于谁是共产革命的主力和领导阶层的问题。说到这儿，很多人会本能反应：这不废话吗，当然是工人阶级了！对，这确实中学政治课本给你的标准答案，是我们的至圣先师马子、亚圣恩子说的。但你要再多问一句：马子恩子为啥就一口咬定是工人阶级呢？你要说共产主义发动穷人没收富人财产可以，但穷人多了去了，你工人阶级有什么特殊的呢？凭啥就得你领导？像之前敏教主巴贝夫提出的也都是农业共产主义，优先发动农民呢。你看，这就是我们这个节目的好处，很多你习以为常的标准答案，多想一步就能发现不少值得琢磨的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Besides these points, our tailor brother had a very unique creation, for which he had multiple online debates and arguments with the later leaders Marx and Engels: the question of who constitutes the main force and leading class of the communist revolution. At this point, many people would instinctively react: Isn't that obvious? Of course, it's the working class! Yes, that is indeed the standard answer given in your middle school political textbooks, stated by our supreme sage Marx and his disciple Engels. But if you ask one more question: Why did Marx and Engels so adamantly insist on the working class? You can say that communism mobilizes the poor to confiscate the property of the rich, but there are many poor people. What's special about your working class? Why should you lead? For example, the previous leader Babeuf also proposed agrarian communism, prioritizing the mobilization of peasants. You see, this is the benefit of our program: many standard answers you take for granted, if you think one step further, you can find many points worth pondering.</p>
</details>

对此，马子的看法是：之前的敏教主、岳老师的农民起义不是都失败了吗？那是因为农民的革命性不够。因为农民从本质上来说是小私有者，他们要么自己有地，要么自己没地，但都想着有钱了就置地自己当地主，而不是想彻底废除私有制。并且因为农民分布在广阔的土地上，彼此缺少联系，也缺乏纪律和组织性。他还打了个比方说，农民就像是一袋土豆，每个土豆都是独立的，没法形成一个统一的整体。但工人就不同了，他们不掌握生产资料，而且集中在城市，每天在流水线上工作，集体意识、纪律性都是资本家给培训好了的。这是什么？只要发枪，这就是现成的军队啊！所以一旦闹起革命来，肯定工人战斗力更强，农民嘛，只能打打下手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In response, Marx's view was: Didn't the peasant uprisings of previous leaders, like Teacher Yue, all fail? That's because peasants lacked sufficient revolutionary spirit. Because peasants are essentially small private owners; they either own land or don't, but they all dream of buying land and becoming landlords once they have money, rather than wanting to completely abolish private ownership. Furthermore, because peasants are scattered across vast lands, they lack connections with each other, as well as discipline and organization. He even used an analogy, saying that peasants are like a sack of potatoes, each potato is independent and cannot form a unified whole. But workers are different; they don't own the means of production, they are concentrated in cities, working on assembly lines every day, and their collective consciousness and discipline are already trained by capitalists. What is this? Just give them guns, and they are a ready-made army! So, once a revolution breaks out, workers will definitely have stronger combat power, while peasants can only play a supporting role.</p>
</details>

但在裁缝看来，你马子说的什么工人、农民都是边角料，真正的革命主体还得看手艺人和**流氓无产者**（Lumpenproletariat: 马克思主义理论中指社会底层、无固定职业、无阶级意识的群体）。用今天的话，就是城里的灵活就业人员、农村的二流子。为什么呢？农民的问题前面说过了，但你说的工人阶级也是个软蛋，革命性不够。因为你在厂里当车工、钳工，也比送外卖稳定吧？老板涨涨工资，或者遇到个胖东来那样的所谓好老板，碍于人情你也就不闹了。但我们手艺人和流氓无产者就不同了，我连稳定的雇主都没有，吃百家饭的，根本不用讲什么感情，一旦搞起暴动，肯定我们下手最狠啊！

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But in the tailor's view, what Marx said about workers and peasants were all marginal elements; the true revolutionary主体 must be artisans and the **lumpenproletariat** (in Marxist theory, the lowest social stratum, without fixed occupation or class consciousness). In today's terms, these are the flexible workers in cities and the idlers in rural areas. Why? The problem with peasants has been discussed, but the working class you speak of is also soft, lacking revolutionary spirit. Because working as a lathe operator or fitter in a factory is more stable than delivering food, right? If the boss raises wages, or you encounter a so-called good boss like Pang Donglai, you won't cause trouble out of human sentiment. But we artisans and lumpenproletariat are different; I don't even have a stable employer, I live off various sources, so there's no need for sentiment. Once a riot starts, we will definitely be the most ruthless!</p>
</details>

为了证明这一点，裁缝还找了个背书说：你看我们耶稣苏哥为啥这么革命？因为他是木匠，手工业者。我魏特林为啥这么卖力鼓动革命？因为我也是手工业者，而且是底层中的底层。也就是说，裁缝的想法是什么？工人的阶级觉悟、集体意识，那都是你们读书人编出来扯淡的。真实情况是谁最穷、过得最惨，谁的革命意愿就最强。不信你看样板戏里是不是都这样？《白毛女》的喜儿、《红灯记》里的李铁梅，那都是苦大仇深，越穷越革命的。这也符合我们的生活常识啊，你看《天注定》里姜武饰演的胡大海和《天下无贼》里王宝强饰演的傻根，他俩都是农民，你说谁更想搞事情？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">To prove this, the tailor even found an endorsement, saying: Look, why was our Brother Jesus so revolutionary? Because he was a carpenter, an artisan. Why am I, Weitling, so vigorously agitating for revolution? Because I am also an artisan, and among the lowest of the low. In other words, what was the tailor's idea? The class consciousness and collective awareness of workers—those are all nonsense concocted by you intellectuals. The truth is, whoever is poorest and lives the most miserably, their revolutionary will is the strongest. Don't you see it's always like this in model plays? Xi'er in "The White-Haired Girl" and Li Tiemai in "The Red Lantern"—they are all deeply resentful, the poorer, the more revolutionary. This also aligns with our common sense. Look at Hu Dahai, played by Jiang Wu in "A Touch of Sin," and Sha Gen, played by Wang Baoqiang in "A World Without Thieves"—both are peasants. Who do you think would be more inclined to cause trouble?</p>
</details>

### 历史的印证：谁是革命的真正主力？

应该说，裁缝这些想法并不是一拍脑袋才有的。首先是大背景，他生活在工业革命兴起的年代。这个年代特征是什么呢？蒸汽与血泪交织，大规模工厂拔地而起，火车取代了马车，仿纱机让无数家庭作坊手工业者破产。所以你如果要问谁是这个时代受伤最深的人，恰恰不是马克思笔下卓别林电影那些经常打螺丝的工人，因为他们好歹还有份工作。不信你看看今天美国反建制派最坚决的都是谁？是那些硅谷的打工人或者码头工人吗？都不是，是铁锈带那些失业多年找不到工作的所谓流氓无产者。那你说马子和我们裁缝到底谁说的更有道理呢？恐怕还是裁缝。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It should be said that the tailor's ideas were not conjured out of thin air. First, there was the broader context: he lived in the era of the burgeoning Industrial Revolution. What characterized this era? Steam and tears intertwined, large-scale factories sprang up, trains replaced horse-drawn carriages, and spinning machines bankrupted countless family workshops and artisans. So, if you were to ask who were the most deeply hurt people of this era, it was precisely not the factory workers depicted by Marx or in Chaplin's films, who at least had jobs. If you don't believe me, look at who are the most resolute anti-establishment figures in America today. Are they Silicon Valley tech workers or dockworkers? Neither. They are the so-called lumpenproletariat in the Rust Belt who have been unemployed for years and cannot find work. So, between Marx and our tailor, who do you think made more sense? Probably the tailor.</p>
</details>

不信你想想啊，历史上所有那些共产党成功夺权的国家，哪个是真的靠工人阶级上台的？你就说苏联，沙皇是怎么被推翻的？是靠当时的工人罢工起义吗？显然不是啊，靠的是那些一战老兵的哗变。如果军队没倒戈，暴力机器依然效忠于沙皇，列宁再怎么鼓动工人也没用。再看中国就更明显了，老毛为什么被人称作“山沟沟里的马克思主义”？为什么会有“农村包围城市”？不就是因为工人不给力搞不起来，得靠裁缝所说的流氓无产者吗？关于这一点，老毛曾经强调过很多次。比如在1925年的《中国社会各阶层分析》一文中，他说：“还有数量不小的游民无产者，失去了土地的农民和失去了工作机会的手工业工人。他们是人类生活中最不安定者。这批人很能勇敢奋斗，但有破坏性，如果引导得法，可以变成一种革命力量。”

<details>

<p class="english-text">If you don't believe me, think about it: in all the countries where communists successfully seized power historically, which one truly came to power relying on the working class? Take the Soviet Union; how was the Tsar overthrown? Was it by worker strikes and uprisings at the time? Clearly not. It was by the mutiny of World War I veterans. If the army hadn't defected and the apparatus of violence still pledged allegiance to the Tsar, no matter how much Lenin incited the workers, it would have been useless. Looking at China, it's even more obvious. Why was Mao Zedong called "Marxism from the ravines"? Why was there "rural encirclement of cities"? Wasn't it precisely because the workers were not effective and couldn't get things going, so it had to rely on the lumpenproletariat, as the tailor said? Mao emphasized this point many times. For example, in his 1925 article "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," he said: "There is also a considerable number of vagrant proletarians, landless peasants, and unemployed artisans. They are the most unstable elements in human life. This group is very capable of brave struggle but also destructive; if guided properly, they can become a revolutionary force."</p>
</details>

而在1948年中央局出版的《湖南农民运动考察报告》里，他说的就更清楚了，我念几条啊：第一，“事实上贫农领袖中，从前有些确是赌钱打牌、四夜不居的。”第二，“作为农村革命基本依靠对象之赤贫阶层，指的是全然无业，既无土地又无资金，完全失去生活依据，不得不外出当兵或出去做工，或打流当乞丐的，或为非作歹做盗贼的，都是赤贫。”第三，“绅士们尤其痛恨下级农民协会的办事人，说他们是痞子。那些从前在乡下所谓踏烂皮鞋的，不劳动游手好闲，并识得几个字的，赌钱打牌的。”电影《秋收起义》里有这么一个段落：一个乞丐看到红军征兵，也想去参军。招兵的见他蓬头垢面、衣不蔽体，就给拒了。乞丐大骂：“你不让我当兵，老子晚上来一把火把你们营房给烧了！”招兵的怒了，立马给他关了起来。然后毛委员来了，在了解情况以后，欣然收他当了兵。乞丐当即乐得跳了起来。当兵要注册，毛委员问他叫什么名字，他说他没名字，人们都叫他“烂皮罗”。老毛觉得这个绰号不好，就给他改了一个名字，叫“蓝鼎天”，意思是从此挺直腰杆，做顶天立地的男子汉。从此，蓝鼎天紧跟毛委员干革命，后来在一次战斗中，他为了掩护毛委员英勇牺牲，成了一名革命烈士。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And in the "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," published by the Central Bureau in 1948, he stated even more clearly; I'll read a few points: First, "In fact, some of the poor peasant leaders were formerly gamblers and stayed out for four nights." Second, "The destitute class, which serves as the basic reliance for the rural revolution, refers to those who are completely unemployed, without land or capital, having completely lost their means of livelihood, and are forced to go out as soldiers or laborers, or to wander as beggars, or to commit crimes as thieves—all are destitute." Third, "The gentry particularly hated the lower-level peasant association officials, calling them ruffians. These were those who were formerly known in the countryside as 'worn-out shoes,' idle and lazy, knew a few characters, and gambled." There's a scene in the movie "Autumn Harvest Uprising": a beggar saw the Red Army recruiting and wanted to join. The recruiter, seeing him disheveled and in rags, refused him. The beggar cursed, "If you don't let me join the army, I'll come tonight and burn down your barracks!" The recruiter, enraged, immediately locked him up. Then Commissioner Mao arrived, and after understanding the situation, gladly accepted him into the army. The beggar immediately jumped for joy. When registering for the army, Commissioner Mao asked his name, and he said he had no name, people just called him "Rotten Skin Luo." Mao felt this nickname was inappropriate, so he changed his name to "Lan Dingtian," meaning to stand tall and be a man of integrity from then on. From then on, Lan Dingtian closely followed Commissioner Mao in the revolution, and later, in a battle, he bravely sacrificed himself to cover Commissioner Mao, becoming a revolutionary martyr.</p>
</details>

事实上，老毛不仅是这么想，这么宣传，也是这么干的。你像我老爷是曾经的土改干部，他不止一次跟我说过，土改批斗地主的时候，上去下狠手的，包括农会的干部，基本上没有正经本分的农民，都是村里的二流子、地痞流氓，想借机报私仇、赖账不还，或者见着谁家老婆闺女好看想借机霸占的。这方面一个最出名的例子，就是所谓“两把菜刀暴动”起家的贺龙。巧的是，这哥们也学过裁缝。关于这个群体，今天有个更流行的说法叫“游民”。历史学家王学泰写过本书叫《游民文化与中国社会》，里面就深入地分析了游民的特点，包括所谓的革命性，强烈建议大家看看啊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In fact, Mao not only thought this way and propagated it, but also acted on it. For instance, my grandfather was a land reform cadre, and he told me more than once that during the land reform struggles against landlords, those who were ruthless, including the peasant association cadres, were basically not honest, law-abiding peasants. They were the village ruffians and local thugs who wanted to take the opportunity to settle personal scores, default on debts, or seize someone's wife or daughter if they found them attractive. One of the most famous examples in this regard is He Long, who started with the so-called "Two Kitchen Knives Uprising." Coincidentally, this fellow also learned tailoring. Regarding this group, there is a more popular term today called "vagrants." The historian Wang Xuetai wrote a book called "Vagrant Culture and Chinese Society," which deeply analyzes the characteristics of vagrants, including their so-called revolutionary nature. I highly recommend everyone to read it.</p>
</details>

再说回老毛，为什么老毛始终看不上王明那些人搞的那套所谓原教旨的马克思主义，嘲笑他们是纸上谈兵？因为这完全违反了他感受到的生活常识。在造反如何才能成功这一点上，显然他这套才是对的。以老毛的文化水平，他肯定是没读过裁缝的著作的，只能说又是流氓所见略同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Returning to Mao, why did he always look down on Wang Ming and his group's so-called fundamentalist Marxism, ridiculing them as armchair strategists? Because it completely contradicted the common sense he experienced in life. On the point of how to successfully rebel, his approach was clearly the correct one. Given Mao's educational background, he certainly hadn't read the tailor's works; one can only say that great minds (or ruffians, in this context) think alike.</p>
</details>

### 马克思恩格斯：将共产主义从信仰升级为“科学”

说完了裁缝魏特林，终于到了我们这个系列的最后一战：第七代教主和副教主马子和恩子。上面说了啊，截止到裁缝这儿，共产主义本质上依然是一种宗教，一种对《圣经》的革命解释。它的感召力来自于上帝面前人人平等的道德激情。但就像前面说的，如果你还打着基督教的旗号，就还有个受不受天主教会领导、信徒会不会被其他教会分流的问题。更何况，这世界上还有很多人压根就不信耶稣，你怎么说服这些人呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Having discussed the tailor Weitling, we finally arrive at the last battle of this series: the seventh-generation leader and deputy leader, Marx and Engels. As mentioned above, up to the tailor, communism was essentially still a religion, a revolutionary interpretation of "The Bible." Its appeal came from the moral passion of equality before God. But as previously stated, if you still operate under the banner of Christianity, there remains the question of whether you are subject to the leadership of the Catholic Church and whether followers might be diverted to other churches. Moreover, there are many people in this world who don't believe in Jesus at all; how do you persuade them?</p>
</details>

于是，马恩两位就登场了。他俩的目标比裁缝宏大得多，他们要将共产主义从一种可以选择的信仰升级为一种不容置疑的科学。而他俩做的第一件事，就是进行了一次巧妙的偷天换日，将上帝替换成了一个在现代社会看来更加政治正确、更加无法反驳的新神——人民，以及他的化身工人阶级。这个新神可远比旧的好使多了。设想一下，地球上可能有一半以上的人可以理直气壮地说：“我不信上帝，我信佛祖或者玉皇大帝行不行？我什么都不信行不行？”这种情况下，你扯耶稣是无效的。但是谁敢公开站出来说“我反人民”的？在道德上，这是一个无法被击败的制高点。哪怕最独裁的独裁者，最起码也会做出表面功夫说“我上台是民心所向”，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thus, Marx and Engels entered the scene. Their goal was far grander than the tailor's: they wanted to upgrade communism from an optional belief to an unquestionable science. And the first thing they did was a clever sleight of hand, replacing God with a new deity that, in modern society, seemed more politically correct and irrefutable: the people, and their embodiment, the working class. This new god was far more effective than the old one. Imagine, perhaps more than half the people on Earth could legitimately say, "I don't believe in God; can I believe in Buddha or the Jade Emperor? Can I believe in nothing at all?" In such cases, invoking Jesus is ineffective. But who dares to publicly declare, "I am against the people"? Morally, this is an unassailable high ground. Even the most authoritarian dictator would at least put on a show and say, "My ascent to power is the will of the people," right?</p>
</details>

而且它还有一个巨大的好处，就是迷惑性极强。只要你把人民，尤其是弱势群体抬出来，把它捧上天，就能提供情绪价值，让大量的蠢货获得心理上的满足感，觉得你是在替他们说话，是正义的，而忽略了你实际上的危害性。比如，你说工人是领导阶级，工农联盟是执政基础，说小孩是社会主义接班人，哪怕这些人实际上都是**人矿牛马**（Human Ore and Cattle/Horses: 网络流行语，比喻被剥削压榨的普通民众）。一场饥荒饿死几千万，但他们中的绝大部分依然会被卖了还帮你数钱。最后，抽象的人民还能杜绝神棍们装神弄鬼。比如你要是拜的是一个人格神，比如上帝这种，就总会有**红袖拳**（Red Sleeve Fists: 虚构的、比喻性的不安分群体）这种不安分的主，大半夜不睡觉跑出来假扮王祖贤，不，假扮上帝的儿子抢班夺权。也总会有傻子跟他走。但人民就不同了，除了我党，谁还能代表人命呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moreover, it has a huge advantage: it is extremely deceptive. As long as you elevate the people, especially vulnerable groups, and praise them to the heavens, you can provide emotional value, allowing a large number of fools to gain psychological satisfaction, feeling that you are speaking for them and are righteous, while ignoring your actual harmfulness. For example, you say that workers are the leading class, the worker-peasant alliance is the foundation of governance, and children are the successors of socialism, even if these people are actually just **human ore and cattle/horses** (a popular internet term, metaphorically referring to ordinary people who are exploited and oppressed). Millions may starve to death in a famine, but most of them will still be sold and help you count the money. Finally, the abstract concept of "the people" can prevent charlatans from playing tricks. For instance, if you worship a personal god, like God, there will always be restless figures like the **Red Sleeve Fists** (a fictional, metaphorical term for restless groups) who stay up all night pretending to be Wang Zuxian—no, pretending to be the son of God to seize power. And there will always be fools who follow them. But the people are different; besides our Party, who else can represent the people?</p>

### “科学”的武器：剩余价值理论的批判

马恩做的第二件事是补足了梅梅没有搞定的最关键的仇恨理论，并且披上了科学的外衣。之前的教主们，比如裁缝，他们的仇恨是朴素的、缺乏逻辑的，因为你有钱我没钱，所以不公平，是你剥削了我。这个逻辑其实站不住脚的，因为你没法论证到底是怎么剥削的。而我们老马就聪明多了，他搞出了个大杀器叫**剩余价值**（Surplus Value: 马克思主义政治经济学核心概念，指工人创造的超出其工资价值的部分），也就是我不光骂你是剥削者、吸血鬼，还用看起来像科学的方式证明了这一点。注意啊，“证明”是加引号的。这个论证过程在中国上过中学的人都耳熟能详，简单说就是你在老板的工厂里打工月薪5000，但实际上你每天只需要工作4个小时创造的价值就足以抵消这5000块钱工资了。可老板却让你工作了八个小时，那多出来的四个小时被老板无偿占有的这部分就是剩余价值。这个理论的威力是颠覆性的，它不再是从道德上谴责富人，而是从科学上给资本家定了罪。甭管你是不是胖东来，你的每一分利润都沾着工人的血汗。这就为后面的暴力抢夺提供了完美的正当性：我打土豪分田地，没收你的公司，给你们掉路灯，不是在作恶，而是科学地取回原本就属于我的东西。

<p class="english-text">The second thing Marx and Engels did was to complete the most crucial theory of hatred that Maymay had failed to establish, and they clothed it in the guise of science. Previous leaders, like the tailor, had a simple, illogical hatred: because you are rich and I am poor, it's unfair, you exploited me. This logic is actually untenable because you cannot demonstrate exactly how the exploitation occurred. But our old Marx was much smarter; he came up with a powerful weapon called **Surplus Value** (a core concept in Marxist political economy, referring to the portion of value created by workers that exceeds their wage value). That is, I not only accuse you of being an exploiter and a bloodsucker, but I also "prove" it in a seemingly scientific way. Note that "prove" is in quotation marks. This argumentation process is familiar to anyone who has attended middle school in China. Simply put, if you work in a boss's factory for a monthly salary of 5000, but in reality, the value you create by working only 4 hours a day is enough to offset this 5000 yuan salary. However, the boss makes you work eight hours, so the extra four hours, which the boss appropriates without compensation, is surplus value. The power of this theory is subversive; it no longer morally condemns the rich but scientifically convicts capitalists. Regardless of whether you are Pang Donglai, every penny of your profit is stained with the sweat and blood of workers. This provides perfect justification for subsequent violent seizure: when I fight local tyrants and divide land, confiscate your company, and hang you from lampposts, I am not committing evil, but scientifically reclaiming what rightfully belongs to me.</p>

但这套看似完美的理论有一个致命的bug，那就是所谓的**必要劳动时间**（Necessary Labor Time: 马克思主义政治经济学概念，指工人生产自身劳动力价值所需的时间）究竟是多少？比如说你一天工作8个小时，凭什么必要劳动时间是4个小时呢？有没有可能是5个小时或者3个小时，或者干脆就是8小时呢？这个标准由谁来定？是怎么算出来的？剩余价值论从没给出过一个可以验证的机制。不信你去问世界上任何一个马院的学者，必要劳动时间和剩余价值到底是怎么算，用什么公式算？没有一个人答得上来说白了，这是一个为了理论的成立而被虚构出来的概念。

<p class="english-text">However, this seemingly perfect theory has a fatal flaw: what exactly is the so-called **Necessary Labor Time** (a concept in Marxist political economy, referring to the time required for workers to produce the value of their own labor power)? For example, if you work 8 hours a day, why is the necessary labor time 4 hours? Could it be 5 hours or 3 hours, or even 8 hours? Who sets this standard? How is it calculated? The theory of surplus value has never provided a verifiable mechanism. If you don't believe me, go ask any Marxist scholar in the world: how are necessary labor time and surplus value calculated, and what formula is used? No one can answer. To put it plainly, this is a concept fabricated for the sake of the theory's validity.</p>

这里我可以做个类比：物理学史上的**以太**（Aether: 19世纪物理学中曾被假设为光传播介质的物质）。在19世纪，物理学家无法解释光为什么能在真空中传播，因为根据地球上的生活经验，波的传导是需要介质的，水波有水，声波有空气，那光呢？于是他们假设宇宙充满了一种看不见摸不着的东西叫以太，光就是在以太里传播的。听起来很合理对吧？可问题是没人能够证明以太的存在。直到后来狭义相对论、麦克逊-莫雷实验横空出世，人们才发现根本就不存在以太这种东西。剩余价值和所谓的必要劳动时间，就是马克思理论中的以太。它是为了解释剥削这个预设好的结论而创造出来的一个既无法被证实也无法被证伪的理论补丁。换言之，它根本就不是科学。

<p class="english-text">Here I can draw an analogy: the **Aether** in the history of physics (a substance once hypothesized in 19th-century physics as the medium for light propagation). In the 19th century, physicists couldn't explain why light could travel through a vacuum, because according to earthly experience, wave propagation requires a medium: water waves have water, sound waves have air, but what about light? So they hypothesized that the universe was filled with an invisible, intangible substance called aether, and light propagated through it. Sounds reasonable, right? But the problem was that no one could prove the existence of aether. It wasn't until the advent of special relativity and the Michelson-Morley experiment that people discovered that aether simply didn't exist. Surplus value and the so-called necessary labor time are the aether in Marx's theory. It is a theoretical patch created to explain the predetermined conclusion of exploitation, which can neither be proven nor disproven. In other words, it is not science at all.</p>

### 马克思的“先射箭后画靶子”：理论构建的真相

也就是说，马克思的整个理论构建过程，其实是先射箭后画靶子。他并不是先通过研究发现了剩余价值，进而得出资本家剥削工人，所以我们要革命的结论，而是先预设了“我们要革命”这个目标，然后反过来编造了一套剩余价值和剥削理论。有人可能要问了：“你有证据吗？”还真有。前面说过，马恩都认为工人阶级是共产革命中革命性最强、觉悟最高的群体，也就是革命的主力军。那这个结论是什么时候做出的呢？1840年代。更具体的说，最迟在1843年12月，马克思在写《黑格尔法哲学批判》的时候，就明确提出了无产阶级需要一次彻底的革命，废除私有制。这会儿他还没将矛头对准资本家，只是笼统地认为需要造反，要搞共产革命。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In other words, Marx's entire theoretical construction process was actually "shooting the arrow first, then drawing the target." He didn't first discover surplus value through research, and then conclude that capitalists exploited workers, leading to the necessity of revolution. Instead, he first presupposed the goal of "we need a revolution," and then fabricated a theory of surplus value and exploitation in reverse. Someone might ask, "Do you have proof?" Indeed, I do. As mentioned earlier, Marx and Engels both believed that the working class was the most revolutionary and conscious group in the communist revolution, meaning the main force of the revolution. When was this conclusion reached? In the 1840s. More specifically, by December 1843 at the latest, when Marx was writing "Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right," he explicitly proposed that the proletariat needed a thorough revolution to abolish private ownership. At this point, he had not yet targeted capitalists; he merely broadly believed that rebellion was necessary and that a communist revolution should be carried out.</p>
</details>

接下来，1845年恩格斯写出了《英国工人阶级状况》。1845到46年，马恩又合作写出了《德意志意识形态》。在这两本书里，他俩明确指出产业工人是唯一能彻底完成革命的阶级，理由前面说过了啊。注意，这会儿他俩还没鼓捣出剩余价值和剥削理论，也不知道什么是必要劳动时间。也就是说，在还没有科学地论证资本家对工人存在剥削之前，他俩就已经预定了“我们得造反，而且就得是工人当主力”。理由非常功利啊：工人工作环境集中，纪律性强，着急起来搞事情方便嘛。但问题是，从逻辑上来看，不应该是先发现剩余价值，知道资本家在剥削工人，觉得工人应该革命，拿回属于自己的一切，才觉得他们是主力的吗？如果你连剩余价值的理论都不知道，就已经清定了工人当主力，那你到底是觉得工人被剥削了替他们打抱不平，还是你本来就想找个由头造反当皇帝，馋工人们的身子呢？很可疑对吧？

<p class="english-text">Next, in 1845, Engels wrote "The Condition of the Working Class in England." From 1845 to 1846, Marx and Engels collaborated on "The German Ideology." In these two books, they explicitly stated that industrial workers were the only class capable of thoroughly completing the revolution, for reasons already mentioned. Note that at this point, they had not yet concocted the theories of surplus value and exploitation, nor did they know what necessary labor time was. This means that even before scientifically demonstrating the exploitation of workers by capitalists, they had already decided, "We must rebel, and workers must be the main force." The reason was very pragmatic: workers' working environments are concentrated, they are highly disciplined, and it's convenient for them to stir up trouble when agitated. But the question is, logically, shouldn't one first discover surplus value, realize that capitalists are exploiting workers, feel that workers should revolt and reclaim what belongs to them, and *then* consider them the main force? If you've already decided that workers are the main force without even knowing the theory of surplus value, then are you truly feeling indignant for exploited workers, or were you just looking for an excuse to rebel and become an emperor, coveting the workers' bodies? It's very suspicious, isn't it?</p>
</details>

那剩余价值论是什么时候出现的呢？直到1867年《资本论》第一卷出版，马克思才完整地阐述了他的剩余价值理论，并在那个大家都不太懂经济学的年代，忽悠了一大票所谓的知识分子。而中间这十几二十年，马克思在干嘛呢？天天泡大英图书馆，给造反找理论依据。最后，他篡改了**亚当·斯密**（Adam Smith: 英国经济学家，古典经济学创始人）和**大卫·李加图**（David Ricardo: 英国经济学家，古典政治经济学代表人物）的**劳动价值论**（Labor Theory of Value: 认为商品的价值由生产中耗费的劳动量决定），编出了自己的仇恨理论——剩余价值。关于剩余价值论错得有多离谱，因为内容比较长，这里就不多说了，有机会单独做一期聊。总之，从图上这个时间线你就能看出马子恩子的心路历程：事先预设了要造反，然后确定得利用工人，然后天天泡图书馆，编出一套错漏百出的理论，证明工人和资本家有仇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when did the theory of surplus value emerge? It wasn't until 1867, with the publication of the first volume of "Das Kapital," that Marx fully elaborated his theory of surplus value, and in an era when most people didn't understand economics, he managed to mislead a large number of so-called intellectuals. And what was Marx doing during those intervening ten or twenty years? He spent his days at the British Library, searching for theoretical justifications for revolution. Finally, he distorted the **Labor Theory of Value** (which posits that the value of a commodity is determined by the amount of labor expended in its production) of **Adam Smith** (British economist, founder of classical economics) and **David Ricardo** (British economist, a leading figure in classical political economy), and concocted his own theory of hatred—surplus value. As for how absurdly wrong the theory of surplus value is, due to its length, I won't go into detail here; perhaps I'll dedicate a separate episode to it. In short, from this timeline, you can see the mental journey of Marx and Engels: they first presupposed the need for revolution, then decided to utilize workers, and then spent their days at the British Library fabricating a flawed theory to prove that workers and capitalists were enemies.</p>

这就好比什么呢？好比马恩就是俩劫匪，想抢银行却找不到门路。研究了一下，发现银行职员张三管着金库钥匙，只要搞定他，就能打开金库。于是，我们老马天天翻资料，终于找到破绽了。这天，他找了张三，说：“我查过了，你其实不姓张，你祖上姓岳，就是岳飞的岳。而这家银行老板姓秦，就是秦桧的秦。你们两家是世仇啊，所以你得帮我开金库，也算是为你们祖上报仇雪恨了。”最后，为让这套说辞写得更有感染力，我们老马还亲自操刀，逐字逐句修改他的战斗檄文《共产党宣言》。我们今天读到的宣言，其实是第二版啊，原版是恩格斯写的《共产主义原理》，语言非常平实，像一本问答手册。马克思看完以后很不满意，觉得煽动性不够。于是他大笔一挥，将原本平实的说明文改成了充满文学性和宗教色彩的战前动员书。像我们耳熟能详的“一个幽灵，共产主义的幽灵，在欧洲的上空游荡”，“资本来到人世间，从头到脚都流着血和肮脏的东西”，这种根本就不是科学论文的写法，而是充满了宗教化措辞的布道士宣告。就像《战狼2》用美式个人英雄主义来拍极端民族主义电影《票房大卖》一样，打着科学幌子的马主义也借着基督教的东风扬帆起航了。

<p class="english-text">What is this comparable to? It's like Marx and Engels were two robbers who wanted to rob a bank but couldn't find a way in. After some research, they discovered that bank employee Zhang San held the vault keys, and if they could get him on board, they could open the vault. So, our old Marx spent his days poring over documents and finally found a loophole. One day, he approached Zhang San and said, "I've checked; your surname isn't actually Zhang. Your ancestors were surnamed Yue, as in Yue Fei. And the owner of this bank is surnamed Qin, as in Qin Hui. Your two families are sworn enemies, so you must help me open the vault; it would be a way to avenge your ancestors." Finally, to make this narrative more compelling, our old Marx personally took charge, revising his battle manifesto, "The Communist Manifesto," word for word. The manifesto we read today is actually the second edition; the original was Engels's "Principles of Communism," which was very plain in language, like a Q&A manual. Marx was very dissatisfied after reading it, feeling it lacked煽动性. So, with a flourish of his pen, he transformed the originally plain explanatory text into a pre-war mobilization book full of literary and religious overtones. Phrases familiar to us, like "A spectre is haunting Europe—the spectre of communism," and "Capital comes into the world, dripping from head to foot, from every pore, with blood and dirt," are not written like scientific papers at all, but rather like a preacher's proclamation filled with religious rhetoric. Just as "Wolf Warrior 2" used American-style individual heroism to make an ultra-nationalist film that became a box office hit, Marxism, under the guise of science, also set sail with the tailwind of Christianity.</p>

### 共产主义与基督教：澄清与界定

说到这儿，我稍微解释两句。第一期的评论区里，有不少缺乏耐心的基督徒一听到共产主义起源于基督教，都等不到后续更新就立马炸毛开骂了。这里我简单回应一下：基督教到底是不是共产主义？回顾前几期的历史，我们会发现，但凡认为基督教是共产主义，或者至少包含了浓重共产思想的人，基本上都会引用《使徒行传》的那几个小节。这其实也是任何一种宗教和思想体系演变的常态，也就是，最初的发起人创造了某种思想，留下了一些经典，后世的人都会按照自己的倾向和意图去解释，强调他想强调的部分，选择性忽略他不喜欢的部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At this point, I'd like to offer a brief explanation. In the comments section of the first episode, many impatient Christians, upon hearing that communism originated from Christianity, immediately flared up and started cursing without waiting for further updates. Here, I'll briefly respond: Is Christianity communism? Looking back at the history of the previous episodes, we will find that anyone who believes Christianity is communism, or at least contains strong communist ideas, will basically cite a few passages from "Acts of the Apostles." This is actually the norm for the evolution of any religion and ideological system; that is, the original founders create a certain idea and leave behind some classics, and later generations will interpret them according to their own inclinations and intentions, emphasizing the parts they want to emphasize and selectively ignoring the parts they dislike.</p>
</details>

比如前面提到解放神学的几个分支，像是黑人神学、女性主义神学，都具有这个特点。比如黑人神学为了给黑人解放运动背书，就会格外强调上帝和耶稣解放者的身份，所以他们最看重《出埃及记》，因为《出埃及记》讲的是上帝和摩西解放犹太人的故事嘛。而对另一些不利于自己观点的文章，比如《以弗所书》里要求仆人顺服主人的例子，就选择性失明。女性主义神学也是，它会重点强调几位女先知，包括圣母玛利亚的贡献，而对那些明显强调父权制的经文，比如夏娃是亚当的肋骨、妻子要顺服她们的丈夫、《哥林多前书》里要求女性在教会中闭嘴等等，视而不见，或者直接拒绝这些经文，认为这不是神的本意。这种独特的解读，就很有可能开创出新的教派或者流派，但这个东西和之前的流派很可能已经不是一回事了。所以共产主义脱胎于基督教，并不能从逻辑上推导出基督教就是共产主义。

<details>

<p class="english-text">For example, several branches of liberation theology mentioned earlier, such as Black theology and feminist theology, all exhibit this characteristic. For instance, Black theology, to endorse the Black liberation movement, will particularly emphasize God's and Jesus's identity as liberators, which is why they value "Book of Exodus" the most, because "Book of Exodus" tells the story of God and Moses liberating the Jewish people. As for other passages unfavorable to their views, such as the example in "Epistle to the Ephesians" requiring servants to obey their masters, they selectively ignore them. Feminist theology is similar; it will emphasize the contributions of several female prophets, including the Virgin Mary, while ignoring or directly rejecting passages that clearly emphasize patriarchy, such as Eve being Adam's rib, wives obeying their husbands, and "First Epistle to the Corinthians" requiring women to remain silent in church, believing these are not God's original intent. Such unique interpretations are very likely to create new denominations or schools of thought, but these may no longer be the same as the previous ones. Therefore, the derivation of communism from Christianity does not logically imply that Christianity *is* communism.</p>
</details>

事实上，如果你回顾《使徒行传》里那段文字的背景，就会发现它只是一种类似捐赠的临时现象，而不是长期性的制度。当时的背景是一天之内有三千多人受洗，大量外地来朝圣的信徒涌入耶路撒冷，出现了吃不饱穿不暖的情况。又因为基督教此时还算地下组织，所以为了保障这些朝圣者的基本生活，一些比较虔诚的信徒就自愿捐献了财产用来互助。有人肯定要说：“就算互助也不用捐全部家产吧，捐一点就行了。”这里还有一个背景，就是当时赶上了圣灵降临日，很多人相信耶稣很快会再来，到时候就是末日审判了。换位思考一下，假如你是个虔诚的基督徒，并且听说下周就要世界末日了，你会不会捐出所有财产？大概率你也会那么做的，反正过完下周就不过了嘛。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In fact, if you review the background of that passage in "Acts of the Apostles," you'll find that it was merely a temporary phenomenon akin to donation, rather than a long-term system. The context at the time was that over three thousand people were baptized in one day, and a large number of pilgrims from out of town flocked to Jerusalem, leading to situations where people didn't have enough to eat or wear. Also, because Christianity was still an underground organization at the time, to ensure the basic livelihood of these pilgrims, some more devout believers voluntarily donated their property for mutual aid. Someone might surely say, "Even for mutual aid, you don't have to donate all your property; a little would suffice." There's another background here: it was Pentecost at the time, and many believed Jesus would return soon, and then it would be the Last Judgment. Putting yourself in their shoes, if you were a devout Christian and heard that the world was ending next week, would you donate all your property? Most likely, you would do so, since life wouldn't continue past next week anyway.</p>
</details>

但纵观《圣经》的全文，耶稣从来就没说过信徒要强制财产充公。正常基督教会的历史上，也从来不存在一个长期固定强制性的共产生活方式。道理很简单，假如耶稣真的主张长期公有制，还搞什么十一税呢？反正都公有了嘛。更何况今天的教会连十一税都自愿捐献了，何来共产一说呢？所以结论很简单，类似裁缝那种“基督教就是共产主义，耶稣是革命烈士”的想法，纯属他自己的解读，和正统的基督教完全是两码事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, throughout "The Bible," Jesus never said that believers must forcibly confiscate property. In the history of normal Christian churches, there has never been a long-term, fixed, mandatory communist way of life. The logic is simple: if Jesus truly advocated long-term public ownership, why would there be tithing? Everything would be public anyway. Moreover, today's churches even donate tithes voluntarily, so how can there be talk of communism? Therefore, the conclusion is simple: ideas like the tailor's, that "Christianity is communism, and Jesus is a revolutionary martyr," are purely his own interpretations and are completely different from orthodox Christianity.</p>

### 共产主义是邪教吗？“永不犯错”的领导人特质

节目的最后，我们回到最初的问题：共产主义是邪教吗？首先，如果将宗教定义改为“以热情和坚定的信念而坚持信仰的原则或者理论体系”，那毫无疑问，共产主义，包括之前卢梭的爱国，都可以是宗教。那它到底邪不邪呢？之前在《法轮功是邪教吗》那期节目里，我们谈到过邪教的三个典型特征：第一，教主是否在世称圣；第二，有没有信息隔绝、强制洗脑、限制人身自由；第三，有没有系统性地对信徒或者其他人造成严重伤害。第二、第三条不用说了啊，生活在中国的人都很清楚。但第一条呢，可能有一定的迷惑性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At the end of the program, we return to the original question: Is communism a cult? First, if the definition of religion is changed to "a principle or theoretical system upheld with passion and firm belief," then undoubtedly, communism, including Rousseau's patriotism mentioned earlier, can be considered a religion. So, is it evil or not? In a previous episode titled "Is Falun Gong a Cult?", we discussed three typical characteristics of a cult: first, whether the leader claims to be a living saint; second, whether there is information isolation, forced brainwashing, and restriction of personal freedom; third, whether there is systematic serious harm caused to followers or others. The second and third points go without saying; anyone living in China is well aware of them. But the first point might be somewhat confusing.</p>
</details>

但就像前面说的，人民和国家这种抽象概念也可以成为神一样，不公然宣称自己是神的教主，依然可以是神。因为神也好，圣也罢，它的本质就四个字：永不犯错。按照这条你再套一下，是不是发现几乎所有共产主义国家的领导人，从老大哥的列宁、斯大林，到中国的毛、习，都有这个特点？在他们生前或者依然掌权的时候，是绝不可能犯错的。反过来你再看看正常的宗教，比如新教的牧师或者天主教的教皇，都是可能犯错，也是可以批评甚至被赶下台的，因为他们是人不是神。而“永不犯错”这个特质，本质上就是为一代代伟大领袖们个人崇拜、造神服务的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But as mentioned earlier, abstract concepts like "the people" and "the state" can also become deities. A leader who doesn't openly declare themselves a god can still be a god. Because whether it's a god or a saint, its essence is four words: never makes mistakes. If you apply this criterion, don't you find that almost all leaders of communist countries, from the elder brothers Lenin and Stalin, to China's Mao and Xi, share this characteristic? During their lifetime or while still in power, it is absolutely impossible for them to make mistakes. Conversely, look at normal religions, such as Protestant pastors or the Catholic Pope; they can make mistakes, be criticized, and even be removed from office, because they are human, not gods. And this trait of "never making mistakes" essentially serves the purpose of personal worship and deification for generations of great leaders.</p>

试想一下，如果毛在生前就要为三年大饥荒承担责任，还可能出现他转送给工人学生的烂芒果被当成圣物崇拜，现在一年一度的韶山出万人跪拜朝圣嘛？换言之，只要习近平们还能永远**伟光正**（Great, Glorious, and Correct: 中国官方宣传中对领导人或党的赞美之词），批评他就有可能坐牢，那他就是在世称圣。同理，只要党还在从一个伟大胜利走向另一个伟大胜利，永远“淫麻”（此处原文为“淫麻”，结合语境可能为“伟大”或“强大”的谐音，或指其影响力无远弗届），那他就是邪教。

<p class="english-text">Imagine, if Mao had to bear responsibility for the Great Famine during his lifetime, would the rotten mangoes he gifted to workers and students still be worshipped as relics, and would there be annual pilgrimages of tens of thousands to Shaoshan today? In other words, as long as figures like Xi Jinping can forever be **Great, Glorious, and Correct** (a phrase of praise for leaders or the Party in Chinese official propaganda), and criticizing him could lead to imprisonment, then he is claiming to be a living saint. Similarly, as long as the Party continues to move from one great victory to another, forever "yin ma" (the original text uses "淫麻," which, in context, might be a homophone for "great" or "powerful," or refer to its pervasive influence), then it is a cult.</p>
