### 安大略省技术行业人才短缺的背景

渥太华和女王公园都希望看到铲子和隧道投入使用，尤其是在安大略省。但要建设这样的未来，我们显然需要能够进行建设的人。安大略省一直在努力解决技术工人短缺的问题，例如通过“**技能发展基金**”（Skills Development Fund: 一项旨在促进技能培训和劳动力发展的政府计划），但该基金却因一些负面新闻而备受关注。那么，尽管存在这些丑闻，它仍然是正确的方法吗？在培养技术行业人才方面，有哪些障碍阻碍了我们？

<p class="english-text">Both Ottawa and Queen's Park want shovels and in Ontario's case, tunnels in the ground. But to build that kind of future, we obviously need people who can build. Ontario has been trying to tackle the shortage of tradespeople with programs like the Skills Development Fund, which has been making the wrong kind of headlines. But is it still the right approach despite the scandals? What obstacles are getting in the way of building up skilled trades?</p>

### 安大略省熟练劳动力现状与未来需求

主持人：好的，让我们从上周的新闻开始。联邦政府和安大略省政府表示，他们将在未来投入资金进行资本项目。这是个好消息。但我想了解一下当前的情况，如果大型项目确实启动，安大略省是否有足够的熟练劳动力来完成这些项目？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so let's start off with last week's news. The federal and Ontario government said that they were going to spend on capital projects in the future. Good news. But I want to get sort of the lay of the land here, and I'll come to you first if and when big projects do get off the ground. Does Ontario have enough skilled labour to build them?</p>
</details>

Karen：这很有趣，因为建筑经济有不同的部门。我认为，对于普通人来说，他们可能想到的是影响他们生活的住宅建筑部门。目前，建筑经济中的住宅部门非常非常缓慢。因此，住宅部门内有许多个人，无论是木匠、水管工还是电工，他们现在可能不忙，可以将他们的技能转移到经济的不同部分。但这并非永久性的，我们正处于低谷。这就是建筑行业，它有许多高峰，也有许多低谷。在这种情况下，我们今天可能还不错，因为我们有不同的部门可能没有达到应有的高水平。但从现在起两三年后，当所有这些项目都启动时，加拿大建筑业（Force Canada）建议我们需要超过10万名建筑工人来填补退休空缺，同时也要增加劳动力以完成我们应该做的项目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is interesting because there's different sectors of the construction economy. I think for, you know, individuals probably think of the construction sector economy where it affects them and that's residential. And right now, actually the residential sector in the construction economy is very, very slow. So there's a number of individuals within the residential sector, whether it be carpenters, whether it be plumbers, electricians that may not be busy right now and can transfer their skill sets to different portions of the economy. But that's not a forever thing. That's we're in a dip. And this is the construction industry. There's a lot of peaks, a lot of valleys. And in this scenario, we're maybe okay today because we have different sectors that are maybe not performing as high as they should be. But in 2 or 3 years from now, when all these projects get on stream, no build, Force Canada suggests that we need over 100,000 construction workers to fill the spots that retirements are taking, but also to increase the workforce in order to do the projects that we should be doing.</p>
</details>

主持人：好的，Brian，我们会谈论建筑行业的周期性，但请让我们了解一下，联邦政府和省政府在这些项目上投入的“代际投资”是否能得到熟练劳动力的支持？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, Brian, we'll talk about the cycle of the construction industry, but get us a sense, we talk about that, the generational, quote unquote, generational investments that the federal government, the provincial government are spending on these projects. But do we have the skilled labour?</p>
</details>

Brian：简短的回答是，没有。我认为我们将会短缺。我们的数据显示，到2034年，将会有大约5万名工人短缺。这已经考虑了人员流失、新移民、移民等因素。所以，肯定会存在短缺。与Karen所说的住宅方面类似，是的，那个特定部门现在非常非常缓慢。将会有一些工人失业，特别是当我们看看多伦多、渥太华、伦敦等城市地区的高层建筑部门时，那里的发展确实放缓了不少。因此，会有一些工人暂时转移到重型土木工程领域。但总的来说，是的，肯定会存在短缺。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the short answer is, is no. I think that we we are going to be short. Our numbers are showing by 2034 there's going to be a shortage of about 50,000 workers. That takes into account attrition, takes into account newcomers, immigration, that sort of thing. So there definitely is going to be a shortage. Similar to what Karen said about the residential side of things is, yes, that that particular sector is very, very slow. There's going to be a number of workers who are out of work, especially when we take a look at the high rise sectors in the more urban areas Toronto, Ottawa, London, that sort of thing where that's really kind of slowed down a fair bit. So there are going to be some workers that will move over temporarily into the icy, heavy civil road side of things. But overall, yes, there is definitely going to be a shortage that's out there.</p>

### 学徒培训的漫长路径与能力挑战

主持人：Karen，请帮我们理解一下，当我们谈论培训时，退休的技术工人与新进入学徒制的人员之间存在怎样的差距？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Karen, help us understand sort of the supply line when we talk about training, what is the gap between tradespeople who are retiring versus those who are coming in entering, say, an apprenticeship?</p>
</details>

Karen：我认为对于公众来说，我们说，政府在过去五年里一直关注的是，是的，我们将吸引更多的技术工人。公众可能会说，好吧，我们会吸引他们，他们进来，开始工作，就这样了。但在**学徒制**（Apprenticeship: 一种结合在职培训和课堂学习的职业培训模式）中并非如此。在学徒制中，根据实际可用的课堂培训量以及学徒是否能获得足够的工作时间，可能需要四到五年，在某些情况下甚至六年，学徒才能获得他们的**资格证书**（Certificate of Qualification: 证明个人在特定行业具备所需技能和知识的官方认证）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think to the general public, we say, you know, the focus on the government has had had for the past five years is that, yes, we're going to attract more skilled trades workers. And I would say the general public probably says, okay, we'll attract them. They come in, they start working and that's it. That's that's not the case in an apprenticeship, in a in an apprenticeship, it can take 4 to 5, in some cases six years depending on how much training is actually available in class training, whether the apprentice is getting their hours, it can take that long for an apprentice to get their certificate of qualification. So the lag time between what we're seeing is a huge increase in registrations over the past five years because of the focus that government has put on apprenticeship and skilled trades. But the lag time between that and completions is quite substantial, depending on what trade you're in, in the voluntary trades, in, in some of the in some of the trades where you don't require a certificate of qualification, you'll see probably it's a little bit of a clearer pathway. It's quicker you can attract those individuals in the industry. They can kind of try a trade. They can figure out where they want to be. But in trades that are compulsory, that pathway is quite long. And part of the Brian spoke to it a little bit, but part of the challenge has actually been we've attracted so many individuals into the trades, specifically in Ontario, but across the country, but specifically in Ontario, they've done such a great job. But the training capacity for the in-class portion of the apprenticeship training has not kept pace with the number of individuals that we're attracting into the trades. So as an apprentice, you know, you do most of your learning on the job, but there are in-class portions in some trades, three, three times you go to school and some, you know, to a college or a training centre. Other trades four times. But those spaces that are funded and delivered through training delivery agencies, but funded through the government, have not kept pace with the number of individuals that are interested in the trades.</p>
</details>

因此，我们看到过去五年里注册人数大幅增加，这得益于政府对学徒制和技术行业的重视。但从注册到完成学徒制之间存在相当大的滞后时间。根据你所从事的行业，在那些不需要资格证书的自愿性行业中，路径可能更清晰，速度更快，你可以吸引这些人进入行业，他们可以尝试一个行业，弄清楚自己想做什么。但在那些强制性行业中，这条路径相当漫长。Brian也提到了一点，但挑战之一实际上是，我们吸引了如此多的人进入技术行业，特别是在安大略省，乃至全国各地，但安大略省做得非常好。然而，学徒培训中课堂部分的培训能力未能跟上我们吸引到行业中的人数。作为一名学徒，大部分学习是在工作中进行的，但在某些行业中，有三次课堂培训，你会去学院或培训中心。其他行业则是四次。但这些由培训机构提供、政府资助的培训名额，未能跟上对技术行业感兴趣的人数。

### 技能发展基金的成效与行业偏见

主持人：Brian，安大略省的技能发展基金有时因各种不当原因而登上头条，但我想更好地了解这个项目在吸引和培训人们从事技术行业职业方面有多大成效。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Brian, Ontario's skills development fund. It's been getting headlines sometimes at the moment for all the wrong reasons, but I want to have better understanding of how effective the program has been in attracting and training people for a career in the trades.</p>
</details>

Brian：总的来说，我会说它非常出色，取得了巨大的成功。这无疑是行业非常赞赏的，特别是当我们考虑到一些学徒前项目，它们试图吸引高中生等进入建筑行业已经很长时间了。我的成长经历中，基本上认为除非你上大学，否则你不会在生活中取得成功。这正是我们每个人都被灌输的观念，这在技术行业周围造成了一些偏见。技能发展基金实际上在这方面提供了很大帮助。因此，无论是将新人带入行业，让他们接触行业，还是让偏远社区以及代表性不足的群体更容易接触到行业，它都做得非常出色。所以，它确实吸引了很多人。它让他们有机会进入技术行业，我认为这让他们看到了超越我们传统上认为的更主流职业道路的成功之路。所以，它在这方面做得非常出色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Overall, I'd say it's been outstanding. It's been a great success. It's certainly something that the industry very much appreciates, especially when we consider some of the pre-apprenticeship programs trying to attract, you know, high school students, that sort of stuff into the construction trades for quite a long time. I mean, I grew up in a generation where it was basically thought of that unless you went to university, you weren't going to be successful in life. And that's really what was driven into each and every one of us, which created a bit of a stigma around the skilled trades. The Skills Development Fund has actually really helped from that side of things. So whether it is bringing new people into the trades, exposing them to it, or making it more accessible for some remote communities as well as underrepresented groups, it's done a fabulous job that way. So it's it's really brought a lot of people in. It's given them the ability to get into the skilled trades. And I think really kind of see that path to success beyond what we sort of traditionally thought we were, were some of the more, I would say kind of the more mainstream ways through to careers. So it's done an incredible job that way.</p>
</details>

Karen：是的，正如Brian所说，它为系统中带来了以前不存在的许多灵活性。我认为我们以前只有三个支柱：学院、大学和技术行业，而技术行业总是被遗忘的。进入技术行业的路径也是如此。尽管政府通过安大略省技术行业和许多不同机构在努力简化路径方面做得很好，但对于个人来说，要理解如何进入技术行业，仍然像纽约地铁图或东京地铁图一样复杂。技能发展基金所做的，是提供了许多真正创新的入门项目。我们谈到了“尝试一个行业”，但为了让个人进入学徒前项目或训练营类型的项目，他们能够看到，好吧，这就是这个行业的样子，这些是期望。这里有所有需要在你踏上工作现场之前进行的安全培训，它也为年轻人提供了所有这些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, to Brian's point, it's it's provided a lot of flexibility in the system that didn't exist prior to this. I think we just had kind of the the the three pillars. We had college, we had university and we had the trades, and the trades was always really forgotten. And it was the pathway into the trades. Although the government's doing a great job through skilled trades, Ontario and through a number of different agencies that are doing a great job in trying to make the path a little bit more simplistic. It's still like what we call either the New York Subway map or the Tokyo subway map for an individual to try to understand how to navigate to the point of getting into the trades and what the Skills Development Fund has done, is, it's provided a lot of really innovative kind of introductory programs in order. We talked about try a trade, but in order for individuals to get into a pre-apprenticeship program or a bootcamp type of program where they are, they're able to kind of see, okay, this is what the industry is like. These are the expectations. Here are here's all the safety training that needs to take place before you even step on the job site and provides all of that to to young individuals as well.</p>
</details>

从雇主的角度来看，代表雇主，它也为雇主提供了一些关于培训的更多指导。我的意思是，雇主最了解行业内正在发生什么以及需要哪些技能。我建议，这个技能发展基金确实具有创新性、响应性、灵活性，能够满足行业所需的技能提升，同时也吸引了以前可能没有接触到的群体进入行业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's also provided from an employer standpoint, representing employers. It's also provided the employers a little bit more, I would say direction on some of the training. I mean, the employers kind of know best on what's happening within the industry and what the what skill sets that are needed. And I would suggest that, you know, this, this skill development fund has been really innovative, responsive, flexible to some of the upskilling that's needed in the industry, but also the attraction of individuals in the industry and reaching groups that maybe routinely were not reached prior to this.</p>
</details>

主持人：Brian，你认为安大略省整个系统最大的优势之一是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Brian, what would you say is one of the biggest advantages of Ontario system overall?</p>
</details>

Brian：所以，有很多途径，我认为这非常重要。对于一些人来说，他们会通过学院系统。在其他情况下，他们会通过一些行业培训中心。它真正做的是，让那些不一定在一些较重的城市地区的人们能够接触到这种培训，能够接触到学徒制，并真正进入技术行业。所以，我会说安大略省最大的优势之一是我们的覆盖范围非常广，遍及全省。我们确实遍布全省的每个角落，并且得到了很好的代表。所以，有很多机会。然后我认为另一个关键是，至少从工会方面来看，是真正关注那些代表性不足的群体。所以，确保我们正在为原住民青年提供大量机会进入技术行业，以及内城群体。所以，它是一个投入了大量时间、精力、金钱来吸引那些原本可能不会进入技术行业的人们的地方。所以，它确实为全省人民提供了职业发展路径。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there's there's multiple pathways. And I think that that is really important. So for some folks, they're going to go through the college system. In other cases, they're going to go through some of the trades training centres. What it really does is it allows for people that are not necessarily in some of the heavier urban areas to be able to access this training, to be able to access apprenticeships and really get into the skilled trades. So I, I would say that one of the biggest strengths for Ontario is really kind of the broad reach that we have right across the province. We really are in every corner of the province and well represented. So there's there are lots of opportunities. And then I think also one of the other keys, at least from the from the unionised side of things as well, is really looking at the underrepresented groups. So making sure that we're, we're providing lots of opportunities for indigenous youth to get into the trades as well as inner city groups as well. So it's it's something where there's there is a lot of time, effort and money that it's actually put into bringing people into the trades who might not otherwise end up there. So it's it's really providing career pathways for people right across the province.</p>
</details>

### 消除行业偏见与教育系统整合

主持人：Karen，Brian提到了与进入技术行业相关的某些偏见。我能理解这种偏见多年来已经有所改变，并取得了一些进展。但你认为目前还有哪些其他障碍，正在阻碍年轻工人进入技术行业的供应链？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Karen, Brian had touched on some of the the stigma associated with entering the trades. I can appreciate that that stigma has changed over the years. There's been some progress in that. But are there any other obstacles that you look at right away? That is something that is blocking the supply chain of young workers who want to get into trades right away?</p>
</details>

Karen：是的，我认为这种偏见正在缓慢地消除。我不会说它已经完全消失了，我的意思是，这是几代人积累起来的偏见。我与Brian有相同的经历，大学是我唯一真正被提供的途径。前几天我走进我儿子的学校，或者说他可能上的高中，看到一个巨大的房间专门用于木工，这让我印象深刻。这在五年前可能是不存在的。我会说这是一个缓慢的消除过程，但正在变得越来越好。我认为，我们成功地说服了年轻人，但我不确定我们是否完全说服了家长。我认为最大的障碍可能是教育系统，它本身并没有错，只是在过去10年、20年，甚至25年左右的时间里，它并没有真正把技术行业作为一条必经之路或需要重点关注的事情，导致了这种偏见的产生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think the stigma is slowly eroding. I wouldn't say it's I mean, this was generations upon generations that actually built this stigma. I'm in the same place as Brian, in which university was the only pathway that was really offered to me. I was so impressed walking into my son's school, the or his potential high school the other day to see this massive room dedicated to carpentry, right? That probably five years ago was it was not in existence. I would say it's it's a slow, slow erosion getting much better, I think. I think, you know, successfully we've convinced the youth, but I'm not sure we're quite there with the parents. And I say the the biggest layer is probably the education system and to no fault of its own, except for it wasn't really a required pathway or something for them to concentrate on over the past 10, 20, I don't know, even 25 years or so that this erosion has taken place.</p>
</details>

所以，我会说我们正在达到一个点，偏见依然存在，但我认为我们还没有完全消除它。然而，通过导师、指导顾问以及安大略省青年学徒计划（该计划已在全省许多高中推广，就像Brian说的，从基诺拉到温莎），我们正在取得进展。但我认为，未来五年真正的重点需要放在将技术行业真正整合到学校系统中，使其在十年级时就成为一个职业选择。这样，在十一年级时，他们就可以开始获得一两个学分，并开始积累学徒时间。这个时间点也已经被引入了。但我们正在取得进展，尽管仍然存在一些小问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I would say we're getting to the point where the stigma is there. I don't think we've completely accomplished that, but the work that is being put into place with with mentors, mentoring, guidance counsellors, actual the Ontario Youth Apprenticeship Program that's been expanded amongst many different high schools across the province, like Brian said, from Kenora down to Windsor, that is that we're getting there. But I think really the focus really needs to be in the next five years on really making it integrated within the school system, making it a career option already in grade ten. So in grade 11, they can probably start getting 1 or 2 credits and and start accomplishing their hours towards their apprenticeship. At that time that's been introduced as well. But we're getting there. But there are still some hiccups.</p>
</details>

### 中小型企业面临的挑战

主持人：Brian，我想更好地了解中小型企业的视角。为什么企业可能不愿意接收学徒？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Brian, I want to have a better understanding of the perspective of a small or medium sized business. Why might a business be reluctant to take on apprentices?</p>
</details>

Brian：哦，很多都归结为时间和金钱。我的意思是，当你考虑招收一名学徒时，会有一个学习曲线。你知道，很多人认为建筑是一种相当初级的活动，你只是把几块木头或其他东西拼凑起来。但事实是，建筑实际上已经变得相当复杂，无论是理解所使用的材料，还是我们许多项目的先进程度。这其中涉及大量的培训和知识。招收一名新学徒，与任何其他企业非常相似，都包含培训的要素。试图让某人快速掌握所有他们需要在现场完成的工作，确实需要强有力的监督。你不能只是让某人自己摸索着完成职业生涯。这不像很多人认为的那种在职学习，要以安全和专业的方式进行建筑工作，需要大量的培训。它需要大量的监督，这对于雇主来说绝对是一个需要考虑的问题，要确保他们准备好招收学徒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, a lot of it comes down to to really time and money. I mean, when you consider bringing on an apprentice, there is a learning curve that's that comes along with that. You know, a lot of people think of construction as really kind of a pretty rudimentary activity to, to undertake, where you're just kind of slapping together a couple pieces of wood or something along those lines. And the fact is, is construction's actually become really quite complicated in terms of understanding kind of the, you know, the materials that are being used, even in terms of how advanced a lot of our projects are. There's a lot of training, a lot of knowledge that goes along with that and with bringing on a new apprentice, very similar to any other business that's out there. There is a training element to that, and trying to bring somebody up to speed with everything that they're expected to do on the site does require really strong supervision. You can't just leave somebody to kind of work their way through the career. It's not it's not that learn on the job type thing that I think a lot of people think it is to be able to do construction work in a safe manner and in a professional way, requires a tremendous amount of training. It requires a lot of supervision, and it is definitely a consideration, you know, for employers to make sure that that they're prepared to bring on that apprentice.</p>
</details>

底线是，他们确实需要为未来做准备。他们确实需要进行那种继任规划，并让学徒完成这个个人层面的旅程，真正让他们获得资格证书，以确保他们有能力胜任这项工作，能够提供高质量的建筑。所以，这是一个重要的考虑因素，但无疑是必须发生的事情。随着建筑业的持续发展，变得更加复杂，这些都是任何雇主都需要考虑的重要因素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Bottom line is, is they do need to prepare for the future. They do need to kind of, you know, work their way through kind of that, that succession planning and that kind of stuff, bringing, you know, an apprentice through that, that journey person level, really getting them that certificate of qualification to make sure that they are competent to do that job, to be able to provide a quality building. So it's it is a big consideration, but certainly something that has to happen, you know, and as as construction continues to build, continues to become a little more complex and that kind of stuff, those are all huge considerations for any employer.</p>
</details>

Karen：是的，我们代表的雇主既有规模庞大、雇佣数千人的企业，也有在全省各地小社区雇佣5到10人的企业。我认为这些雇主面临的最大障碍是理解和驾驭这个系统。比如，注册一名学徒需要什么？这意味着我要在日志中记录工作时间。他们需要完成哪些任务才能进入第一阶段的学校学习？有太多的学习需要进行。对于学徒和雇主来说，试图驾驭这个系统，仅仅是行政管理这个概念，有时对于那些在完成会计、工作安排等所有其他事情之后，在办公桌旁顺便处理这些事情的中小型雇主来说，可能会相当令人生畏。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, we have we represent employers that are incredibly large, that are employing thousands of individuals, as well as employers that are employing 5 to 10 individuals across the province and small little communities. And the one thing that I think the biggest hiccup for these employers is really the understanding and navigating the system. Like, what does it take to register an apprentice? What does it mean that I'm watching the hours in the logbook. Which tasks do they have to accomplish in order to get to their first tranche of schooling? There's there's so much learning that takes place. On trying to navigate the system for both the apprentice and the employer, that just just that idea of the administration, sometimes for small and medium sized employer that's doing this off the side of their desk, after doing their accounting, after doing everything else, the job scheduling it is it it can be quite daunting.</p>
</details>

我认为雇主普遍存在的另一个担忧是，他们希望支持年轻人。他们希望年轻人学习。他们不希望学徒不成功。他们希望看到学徒成功。我认为对于一些雇主来说，他们不确定自己是否能投入足够的时间进行指导。或者他们是否能够确保学徒完成日志中所有任务，以完成所有这些任务，从而能够获得资格证书？我的意思是，对于水管工来说，有很多不同的任务，一家小型水管公司可能无法提供所有这些任务，以理解并获得资格证书。所以，我可以说更多关于这一点，但技能发展基金最大的成功之一是他们资助了针对全省中小型雇主的**团体赞助计划**（Group Sponsorship Programs: 一种支持中小型企业培训学徒的项目），这些计划为学徒和中小型雇主提供了更多驾驭系统和支持经济这部分培训的能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the other fear for employers generally is that they, you know, employers want to support the youth. They want them to learn. They don't want to not have an apprentice succeed. They want to see the apprentice succeed. And I think for some employers, they're they're not necessarily sure that they can spend enough time mentoring. Or are they going to be able to ensure that they get all the tasks that are done within the logbook to accomplish all those tasks in order to to to be able to write their certificate of qualification? I mean, in a plumber, there's, you know, for a plumber, there's so many different tasks that a small little plumbing company may not offer. Every single task that is included in order to understand and write your certificate of qualification. So and I can speak a little bit more about this, but one, one of the I would say one of the, the, the biggest success of the Skills Development Fund is their funding of what's called group sponsorship programs for small and medium sized employers across the province that provide both the apprentice and the small and medium sized employer. The ability to kind of navigate the system a little bit more and support that portion of the economy in training as well.</p>

### 经济低迷时期的学徒支持与跨省流动障碍

主持人：好的，Brian，我想让你补充一下关于学徒制的问题。我们知道安大略省和加拿大的失业率正在上升。我们谈到了建筑行业周期性的运作方式。当我们谈到住宅时，在某些情况下，这可能会导致人们完全放弃建筑行业，更不用说寻找和寻求学徒机会了。当情况变得艰难时，安大略省可以做些什么来支持学徒制和其他行业？

<p class="english-text">All right, Brian, I'm going to get you to add on to that in terms of, you know, apprenticeships. We know the unemployment rates in Ontario and Canada are rising. We talked about the sort of cyclical way the construction industry works. When we talk about residential as well, it may drive people, in some cases to just walk away from construction entirely, let alone looking and seeking apprenticeships. What could Ontario do to support apprenticeships and other trades when times do get tough?</p>

Brian：嗯，我认为他们现在正在做。我认为他们在技能发展基金方面做得很好。这正是确保我们让人们进入学徒制并确保他们成功完成学徒制所必需的。最大的问题之一是确保学徒能够完成他们的整个学徒期。所以，无论是两年、三年、四年还是五年的学徒期，都要努力让他们完成，直到他们真正获得他们的旅程人或随后的资格证书。所以，我认为这是一个支持他们完成学徒期的问题。这要确保有强大的工作管道。所以现在，我的意思是，我们非常幸运，在医院建设和重型土木工程方面有非常强大的管道。所以，像交通这样的事情，它确实让建筑行业保持活力。你知道，今年有关关税等事情正在发生。

<p class="english-text">Well, I think I think they're doing it right now. I think they're doing a great job with that skills development, funding. It is exactly what is required to make sure that we get people into apprenticeships and make sure that they successfully complete them. That's one of the biggest issues, is making sure that the apprentices go all the way through their apprenticeship. So whether it's a two, three, 4 or 5 year apprenticeship, it's trying to get them through to the point where they've actually got their, you know, their journeyperson or the certificate of qualification that follows that. So I think it's a matter of supporting them through it. It's making sure that there's a strong pipeline of work that's there. So right now, I mean, we've been very fortunate in that we've got a very strong pipeline in terms of our, you know, hospitals being built, the heavy civil. So things like transit, that sort of thing. It's really keeping the construction sector alive. You know, this year with tariffs and that sort of stuff going on.</p>

主持人：Karen，各省之间存在哪些障碍，阻碍了一些技术行业人员在各省之间自由流动？

<p class="english-text">Karen, what barriers exist between provinces that prevent some people in the trades from moving freely between them?</p>
</details>

Karen：所以，已经引入了立法，安大略省和新斯科舍省在这方面也发挥了领导作用，试图打破许多这些障碍。建筑行业和其他行业的一大优势是，有一类行业被称为**红印章行业**（Red Seal trades: 加拿大全国认可的熟练行业标准）。如果你在全国范围内获得了红印章认证，你就可以带着你的红印章身份从安大略省搬到不列颠哥伦比亚省，再到艾伯塔省。它在所有省份都得到认可。并非每个建筑行业、工业行业甚至服务行业都具有红印章行业的这种认可。我的意思是，厨师也有，但并非每个行业都有。因此，技术行业人员的流动也一直是各省面临的挑战，因为每个省对什么是强制性行业和什么不是强制性行业有不同的列表。

<p class="english-text">So there's been legislation introduced and Ontario took leadership on this as well as Nova Scotia to kind of, I would say, attempt to break down many of these barriers. The great thing about the construction industry and other trades is there are a bucket of trades called Red Seal trades in which if you are a Red Seal certified trade across the country, you can move from Ontario to British Columbia to Alberta with your Red Seal status. It's recognised across all the provinces. Not every single construction, trade or industrial trade or even service sector trade has that recognition of a Red Seal trade. I mean, you do you do with chefs as well, but you don't necessarily have that with every single trade. So the movement of individuals in the trades themselves is also has been a challenge for provinces, because each province has a different list of what is a compulsory trade and what is not a compulsory trade.</p>
</details>

所以，我会说学徒实际上面临着更大的障碍，因为这完全取决于课堂培训的时间安排和顺序。所以在安大略省，你可能在第一阶段的课堂培训中做不同的事情，这与你在不列颠哥伦比亚省可能做的事情不同。所以你仍然可以积累那些工作时间。你仍然可以获得你的工作时间，并工作到8000或9000小时，或者无论多少小时，但当轮到你上课并参加学徒制的课堂部分时，你将面临障碍，因为这些在不同省份根据行业有不同的顺序。所以，学徒在许多情况下实际上比已经完成学徒期的旅程人面临更大的障碍。

<p class="english-text">So I would say the apprentices actually face more of a hurdle, because it all depends on how the apprenticeship timing for in class is, is sequence. So you in Ontario you may be doing different things in your first tranche of in class than you might be doing in British Columbia. So you can still probably you can still create those hours. You can still get your hours and work to your 8000 or 9000 or whatever it may be, but you are going to face a hurdle when it's time for you to go to in class and take your in-class portion of your apprenticeship, because those are sequenced differently in different province depending on the trade. So the apprentice actually faces, in many cases, more of a hurdle than the actual journeyperson who has finished their apprenticeship.</p>
