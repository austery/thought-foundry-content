### 美国司法部发布爱泼斯坦文件，引发争议

美国司法部近日部分释放了与杰弗里·爱泼斯坦相关的文件，但因大量删减而遭到国会部分议员的批评。他们认为司法部没有按照法律要求充分释放所有文件。

>> “司法部是在敷衍了事，我不会在受害者满意之前妥协。” —— 共和党议员托马斯·马西

马西曾推动要求释放爱泼斯坦文件的法律，他批评司法部删减过多。在一起案件中，一份100多页的文件几乎被完全涂黑。一些爱泼斯坦的受害者告诉《纽约时报》，他们对司法部的处理方式感到失望和沮丧。

>> “法律明确要求释放的关键文件并未被释放。这不是关于时间的问题，而是选择性隐瞒。” —— 托马斯·马西

马西和民主党议员罗·K·康纳正在起草一项决议，以追究司法部长帕姆·邦迪的 contempt 责任，并对她每天不释放文件施加罚款。

### 美国加紧对委内瑞拉的压力

在加勒比海地区，美国海岸警卫队在周末拦截了两艘油轮，其中一艘在周六被登上。 当试图拦截第二艘油轮时，据美国官员称，该油轮向东北方向逃跑，进入大西洋，并发送了数十个求救信号。

这两艘油轮属于一个“幽灵船队”，它们在违反制裁的情况下从委内瑞拉、俄罗斯和伊朗运输石油。美国官员表示，他们有一份逮捕令，理由是该船过去曾与伊朗有牵连。

### 美国可能修改儿童疫苗接种计划

美国卫生部长罗伯特·F·肯尼迪二世预计将宣布，美国儿童将接种较少的疫苗，改为遵循丹麦的疫苗接种计划。这可能会意味着跳过目前推荐的七种疫苗，包括呼吸道合胞体病毒（RSV）、流感、轮状病毒、鸡痘、脑膜炎和甲型及乙型肝炎。

丹麦官员表示，他们对美国的医疗体系与丹麦的巨大差异感到困惑。丹麦的人口规模相当于威斯康星州，享有全民医疗保健。

### 加拿大面临枪支暴力威胁

在加拿大， authorities 正面临着一种曾经罕见的威胁：枪支暴力。加拿大警方正在调查多起枪击事件，其中包括多伦多附近的双重枪击案。

近年来，多伦多及周边地区黑帮枪击事件激增，流弹击中并杀死儿童。警方表示，他们正在以空前速度查获非法枪支，几乎所有这些枪支都来自美国。

From
 the
 [music]
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's

the
 headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.

Today's
 Monday,
 December
 22nd.
 Here's

what
 we're
 covering.

The
 Justice
 Department
 is
 under
 intense

scrutiny
 for
 its
 partial
 release
 of
 the

Epstein
 files.
 It
 put
 thousands
 of
 pages

of
 photographs
 and
 documents
 up
 online

on
 Friday
 before
 the
 deadline
 set
 by

Congress.
 But
 some
 lawmakers
 say
 the

department
 didn't
 release
 enough.

>> They're
 flouting
 the
 spirit
 and
 the

letter
 of
 the
 law,
 and
 I
 won't
 be

satisfied
 until
 the
 survivors
 are

satisfied.

>> Republican
 representative
 Thomas
 Massie,

who
 helped
 push
 for
 the
 law
 that

demanded
 the
 release,
 criticized
 how

heavily
 redacted
 the
 files
 were.
 In
 one

case,
 a
 100
 plus
 page
 document
 was

entirely
 blacked
 out.
 and
 Massie
 echoed

what
 some
 of
 Epstein's
 victims
 told
 the

Times
 that
 they
 feel
 disappointed
 and

frustrated
 that
 the
 department
 didn't

release
 more.

>> The
 key
 documents
 that
 our
 law

basically
 said
 needed
 to
 be
 released
 were
 not

released.
 It's
 not
 about
 the
 timeline,

it's
 about
 the
 selective
 concealment.

Massie
 said
 that
 he
 and
 Democratic

Congressman
 Ro
 K Connor
 are
 drafting
 a

resolution
 to
 hold
 Attorney
 General
 Pam

Bondi
 in
 contempt
 and
 impose
 a
 fine
 on

her
 for
 every
 day
 that
 she's
 not

releasing
 these
 documents.

>> You're
 talking
 about
 a
 million
 or
 so

pages
 of
 documents.
 Virtually
 all
 of

them
 contain
 victim
 information.
 The

Justice
 Department,
 meanwhile,
 says
 it's

working
 to
 comply,
 but
 that
 it's
 a
 huge

undertaking,
 especially
 to
 make
 sure
 no

survivors
 information
 is
 exposed.
 Deputy

Attorney
 General
 Todd
 Blanch
 argued
 that

protecting
 that
 info
 outweighed
 any

deadline.
 He
 also
 said
 that
 the

department
 was
 not
 redacting
 any

mentions
 of
 President
 Trump
 from
 the

files
 as
 it
 continues
 to
 release
 them.

One
 picture
 of
 Trump
 had
 been
 deleted

and
 then
 republished
 over
 the
 weekend.

[music]

In
 all,
 there
 were
 no
 major
 revelations

in
 the
 new
 documents,
 but
 the
 pictures

reinforced
 the
 broad
 range
 of
 famous

people
 in
 Epstein's
 orbit.
 From
 rock

stars
 like
 Michael
 Jackson
 and
 Mick

Jagger
 to
 legendary
 news
 anchor
 Walter

Kankite
 and
 former
 President
 Bill

Clinton.
 [music]

In
 a
 significant
 escalation
 of
 its

pressure
 campaign
 on
 Venezuela,
 the
 US

moved
 to
 intercept
 two
 oil
 tankers
 in

the
 Caribbean
 over
 the
 weekend.
 The

Coast
 Guard
 boarded
 one
 ship
 on

Saturday.
 When
 it
 tried
 to
 stop
 the

second,
 several
 US
 officials
 tell
 the

Times
 that
 that
 boat
 fled
 heading

northeast
 back
 into
 the
 Atlantic
 Ocean

as
 it
 sent
 out
 dozens
 of
 distress

signals.
 The
 vessel
 is
 called
 the
 Bella

1
 and
 it's
 part
 of
 a
 ghost
 fleet.
 Ships

that
 move
 oil
 from
 Venezuela,
 Russia,

and
 Iran
 in
 violation
 of
 sanctions.
 They

often
 disguise
 where
 they're
 traveling

and
 file
 false
 paperwork.
 Officials
 say

American
 authorities
 have
 a
 warrant
 to

seize
 the
 Bella
 1
 because
 of
 its
 past

involvement
 with
 Iran.
 Trump

administration
 officials
 have
 said
 the

boarding
 operations
 are
 part
 of
 an

effort
 to
 weaken
 Nicholas
 Maduro's

government,
 which
 they
 say
 is
 using
 oil

money
 to
 fund
 cartel
 operations.

Venezuela's
 denounced
 the
 move
 as
 theft

and
 hijacking,
 and
 Maduro's
 ordered
 his

country's
 navy
 to
 escort
 tankers
 in

Venezuelan
 waters.
 Both
 ships
 this

weekend
 seem
 to
 be
 out
 of
 range
 of
 that

kind
 of
 support.
 The
 fear
 of
 more

seizures
 could
 deter
 tankers
 from

traveling
 to
 Venezuela.
 According
 to
 a

site
 that
 monitors
 global
 shipping,

some
 vessels
 that
 appear
 to
 have
 been
 heading

there
 have
 recently
 turned
 around.

[music]

And
 last
 update
 on
 the
 administration
 in

the
 new
 year,
 Health
 Secretary
 Robert
 F.

Kennedy
 Jr.
 is
 poised
 to
 make
 a
 seismic

shift
 in
 the
 childhood
 vaccine
 schedule.

He's
 been
 a
 longtime
 skeptic
 of

immunizations
 and
 he's
 expected
 to

announce
 that
 American
 kids
 should

receive
 fewer
 of
 them
 instead
 following

a
 schedule
 that's
 used
 in
 Denmark.

would
 mean
 skipping
 seven
 shots
 that
 are

currently
 recommended.
 Those
 for
 RSV

which
 is
 the
 leading
 cause
 of
 infant

hospitalizations
 in
 the
 US
 as
 well
 as

influenza,
 rotoirus,
 chickenpox,

menitis,
 and
 hepatitis
 A
 and
 B.

Officials
 in
 Denmark
 say
 they're
 baffled

because
 their
 medical
 system
 is
 very

different
 from
 the
 one
 in
 the
 US.

Denmark's
 population
 is
 the
 size
 of

Wisconsin
 and
 they
 have
 universal

healthcare.
 The
 US
 vaccination
 schedule,

meanwhile,
 is
 tailored
 for
 America's

large
 and
 diverse
 population
 and
 patchy

health
 care
 system.
 An
 official
 at

Denmark's
 equivalent
 of
 the
 CDC
 told
 the

Times,
 quote,
 "It's
 not
 at
 all
 fair
 to

say,
 look
 at
 Denmark,
 unless
 you
 can

match
 the
 other
 characteristics
 of

Denmark."
 A
 wholesale
 revision
 of
 the

vaccination
 schedule
 could
 affect

whether
 private
 insurance
 and
 government

assistance
 programs
 will
 cover
 the
 shots

for
 kids.
 And
 many
 public
 health
 experts

worry
 that
 a
 change
 could
 also
 further

erode
 Americans
 confidence
 in

immunizations.

There
 have
 been
 measles
 and
 whooping

cough
 outbreaks
 in
 multiple
 states

already
 because
 of
 dropping
 vaccination

rates.

In
 Canada,
 authorities
 are
 grappling

with
 a
 threat
 that
 used
 to
 be
 rare
 in

the
 country,
 gun
 violence.

>> We
 have
 breaking
 news
 [music]
 this
 hour.

Police
 are
 investigating
 a
 double

shooting
 near
 Kill
 and
 Rogers
 Road.

Toronto
 police
 are
 also
 investigating
 a

shooting
 in
 North
 York,

>> though
 it
 remains
 far
 lower
 there
 than

in
 the
 US.
 In
 recent
 years,
 there's

been
 a
 spike
 in
 gang
 shootings
 in
 and
 around

Toronto,
 for
 example.
 Stray
 bullets

have
 hit
 and
 killed
 children,
 and
 police
 say

that
 they
 are
 seizing
 illegal
 guns
 at
 an

unprecedented
 rate.
 And
 in
 almost
 every

case,
 those
 guns
 originated
 in
 the
 US.

In
 Ontario,
 for
 example,
 officials
 say

more
 than
 90%
 of
 handguns
 recovered
 at

crime
 scenes
 last
 year
 were
 smuggled

across
 Canada's
 southern
 border.
 They

believe
 the
 actual
 figure
 is
 even

higher,
 but
 many
 guns
 have
 been
 tampered

with
 to
 make
 them
 untraceable.

Canada
 has
 far
 stricter
 gun
 laws
 than

the
 US.
 It's
 virtually
 impossible
 to

legally
 buy
 or
 transfer
 a
 handgun
 there.

That's
 made
 smuggling
 extremely

lucrative.
 One
 police
 superintendent

told
 the
 Times
 that
 a
 handgun
 bought
 in

the
 US
 for
 about
 500
 bucks
 can
 sell

for
 more
 than
 $4,000
 in
 Canada.
 Smugglers

have
 sent
 guns
 up
 north
 in
 commercial

vehicles,
 stashed
 them
 on
 boats,
 and

even
 loaded
 them
 up
 on
 drones
 to
 ferry

across
 the
 border.

[music]

>> And
 finally,

>> the
 absolute
 Mayhem
 outside
 the
 Whimo

Depot.
 Here

>> in
 San
 Francisco
 this
 weekend,
 there
 was

self-driving
 car
 chaos.

>> The
 Whimos
 are
 crazy.

>> There's
 like
 a
 massive
 traffic
 jam

caused
 by
 them.

>> A
 power
 outage
 hit
 the
 city
 on
 Saturday,

leaving
 tens
 of
 thousands
 of
 households

without
 electricity.
 It
 also
 took
 down

the
 Whimos.

>> All
 the
 self-driving
 cars
 are
 tripping

right
 now.

>> [laughter]

>> They're
 just
 stuck
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 the

street.

>> The
 robot
 taxis
 stopped
 at
 darkened

traffic
 signals,
 blocking
 cars
 and

angering
 the
 human
 drivers
 that
 got

blocked
 in.
 No
 injuries
 or
 accidents

were
 reported,
 but
 social
 media
 lit
 up

with
 videos
 of
 stalled
 cars.
 And
 tow

truck
 drivers
 said
 they
 spent
 hours

working
 overnight
 into
 Sunday
 towing

Whimos.
 The
 malfunction
 was
 a
 bit
 of
 a

headscratcher
 since
 Whimo
 and
 other

self-driving
 car
 companies
 design
 their

vehicles
 to
 keep
 working
 even
 if
 they

lose
 access
 to
 wireless
 networks
 or
 when

they
 run
 across
 a
 traffic
 light
 with
 no

power.
 Whimo
 said
 in
 a
 statement
 that

the
 sheer
 scale
 of
 the
 outage
 was
 a

factor
 in
 the
 disruption
 and
 the
 company

[music]
 restored
 service
 by
 last
 night.

[music]
 Those
 are
 the
 headlines.
