### 移民行动与拘留中心

**Tracy Mumford**: 纽约时报播报，我是 Tracy Mumford。今天周五，2月13日。以下是我们今天关注的要点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Friday, February 13th. Here's what we're covering.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 我已提议，**特朗普总统**也已同意，此次“突击行动”将告一段落。本周已开始显著的撤离行动，并将持续到下周。在**明尼苏达州**，**特朗普总统**的边境事务官员**Tom Homan**已宣布，政府正在那里逐步结束其激进的移民执法行动。这项始于去年年底的史无前例的部署，动用了数千名移民官员，并导致了与居民的广泛冲突以及联邦探员的两次致命枪击事件。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: I have proposed and President Trump has concurred that this surge operation conclude. A significant draw down has already been underway this week and will continue to the next week. In Minnesota, President Trump's border Tom Hman has announced that the administration is winding down its aggressive immigration operations there. The unprecedented deployment, which started late last year, involved thousands of immigration officers and led to widespread clashes with residents and two fatal shootings by federal agents.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: **明尼苏达州**的**双子城**，以及整个地区，因为我们在**特朗普总统**领导下所取得的成就，将继续变得对这里的社区更加安全。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: The Twin Cities, Minnesota in general, are and will continue to be much safer for the communities here because of what we have accomplished under President Trump's leadership.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 在一次新闻发布会上，**Homan**将此次突击行动定性为一次成功，称有4000名无证移民被捕，其中一些人已被判犯有重罪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Homan**: In a press conference, Hman framed the surge as a success, saying 4,000 undocumented immigrants had been arrested, some of whom had been convicted of serious crimes.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: “生活在**明尼苏达州**受到影响的方式，怎么强调都不为过。”我的同事**Talia Minsburg**是《纽约时报》记者团队的一员，在过去的几个月里一直在**双子城**实地采访。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Talia Minsburg**: The way that life has been impacted in Minnesota, it can't be overstated. My colleague Talia Minsburg has been part of the team of Times reporters on the ground in the Twin Cities over the past few months.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: “你可以看到人们自愿站在日托中心、小学和高中外面，穿着荧光背心，留意**ICE**（移民及海关执法局）。你会听到任何时候**ICE**车辆经过时，都有刺耳的口哨声。有时你会看到被遗弃的汽车，如果**ICE**非常突然地带走了某人。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Talia Minsburg**: You could see people volunteering to stand outside of daycarees and elementary schools and high schools in neon vests looking out for ice. You would hear these incessant whistles anytime ICE vehicles drove by. Sometimes you would see abandoned cars if ice had taken someone very abruptly.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: “当你去杂货店时，你会看到很多人推着装得很满的购物车，因为很多人在为朋友、邻居购买食品，那些可能藏在家中、可能不敢自己出门去杂货店的人。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Talia Minsburg**: And when you go to the grocery store, you see a lot of people with really full carts because a lot of people are grocery shopping for friends, neighbors, people who may be hiding in their homes, who may not feel safe going out to the grocery store themselves.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: “我采访了很多人，他们说，当他们开车时，他们感觉自己一直在看后视镜。所以，这既是你视觉上能看到的，也是很多人在过去几个月里真正感受到的。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Talia Minsburg**: I talked to a lot of people who just as they drove, they just felt that they were looking in their rear view mirror a whole lot. So, it's both something you saw visually and something that was really felt for a lot of people for months now.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: “我们谨慎乐观，但事实是，他们给我们留下了**严重的破坏**，**世代创伤**。在某些情况下，他们给我们留下了**经济的废墟**。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Talia Minsburg**: Uh we are cautiously optimistic, but the fact of the matter is they left us with deep damage, generational trauma. They left us with economic ruin in some cases.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 针对**Homan**昨天宣布的消息，**明尼苏达州州长 Tim Walls**表示，该州处于“信任但验证”阶段，正等待观察这些行动是否会真正结束。他告诉居民，在此期间，他们应保持“高度警惕”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: In response to Hman's announcement yesterday, Minnesota Governor Tim Walls said the state was in a trust but verify phase, waiting to see if the operations do actually end. He told residents that in the meantime, they should remain quote hypervigilant.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 即使白宫表示正在结束在**明尼苏达州**的大规模部署，政府的**大规模驱逐行动**仍在全国范围内继续。几周前，所谓的**ICE**突击队曾出没于**西弗吉尼亚州**的小城镇，并表示逮捕了600多人。在**俄勒冈州希尔斯伯勒**，当地警方接到了多起911报警电话，报告称一群蒙面持枪男子在一辆载有高中生的汽车旁边的得来速（drive-thru）处进行了拦截。警方后来确认这些人是联邦探员。而在**德克萨斯州迪利**一个广阔的拘留中心，**《纽约时报》**一直在追踪联邦拘留儿童数量的急剧上升情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Even as the White House says it's ending the large-scale deployment in Minnesota, the government's mass deportation efforts are continuing across the country. A few weeks ago, so-called ICE surge teams fanned out across small towns in West Virginia, and said they arrested more than 600 people. In Hillsboro, Oregon, local police responded to multiple 911 calls, reporting that a group of masked men with weapons drawn had approached a car filled with high school students at a drive-thru. Police later determined the men were federal agents. And at a sprawling detention center in Dilly, Texas, the Times has been tracking how the number of children in federal custody has climbed sharply.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 数百名儿童，通常与父母一同，在过去一年中被关押在那里。有些人只被拘留几天，但另一些人则在由拖车和帐篷组成的混乱环境中度过数月。家属和律师告诉《纽约时报》，那里的教育**严重不足**，**医疗护理也存在问题**。儿童经常**体重下降并生病**。一些人出现了**恐慌发作**，甚至**产生自杀念头**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Hundreds of kids, usually with a parent, have been detained there in the past year. Some are held for only a few days, but others spend months amid the jumble of trailers and tents. Families and lawyers tell the Times that there's little education and inadequate medical care. Children often lose weight and get sick. Some have had panic attacks and even become suicidal.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: **美国国土安全部**为该设施的生活条件和教育机会进行了辩护，并表示已向家庭提供2600美元和免费机票让他们自愿离开美国，但许多家庭拒绝了这一提议。一些家庭可能在移民法庭有未决案件，这让他们抱有获准留在美国的希望，而另一些家庭则害怕返回自己的祖国。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: The Department of Homeland Security has defended living conditions and education access at the facility and said that families are being offered $2,600 and a free flight to leave the US voluntarily, but many families have refused the offer. Some may have pending cases in immigration court, giving them hope they might be allowed to stay in the US, and others fear returning to their home countries.

</details>

### 气候政策调整

**Tracy Mumford**: 这件事很重要。如果你关心环境，这件事就非常重大。**特朗普总统**昨天宣布了一项重大政策变动，该变动实际上**取消了联邦政府应对气候变化的权威**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: This is a big one. If you're into environment, this is about as big as it gets, they tell me. President Trump announced a major policy change yesterday that effectively erases the federal government's authority to fight climate change.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: “那都结束了，没了。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Quote**: That's all dead, gone, over.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 此举撤销了所谓的“**致危认定**”（endangerment finding）。这是**奥巴马政府**时期的一项科学认定，即**温室气体**对人类健康构成威胁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: The move repeals what's called the endangerment finding. It's a scientific determination made under the Obama administration that states that greenhouse gases are a threat to human health.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 废除这项认定，基本上就**终结了联邦政府对导致地球变暖的污染物的管控权**。对于气候变化否认者来说，这次撤销被视为一种“圣杯”，因为它有可能阻止未来的政府监管某些污染物。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Getting rid of that finding basically ends the federal government's legal authority to cap pollution that's heating the planet. For climate change deniers, this repeal has been seen as a kind of holy grail because it has the potential to stop even future administrations from regulating some pollutants.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 目前，这为白宫**放松对汽车和发电厂等排放限制**铺平了道路。**美国环保署（EPA）**署长与**特朗普**一同出席了宣布会，他表示，废除这项认定将阻止“**美国经济被监管所扼杀**”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: For now, it clears the way for the White House to roll back limits on emissions from things like cars and power plants. The head of the EPA, who joined Trump for the announcement, said scrapping the finding will stop the American economy from being quote strangled by regulations.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 但这一改变与数十年来关于气候变化的科学共识背道而驰，这些共识认为，排放加剧了**热浪、干旱、野火和其他极端天气事件**。这也标志着**石油和天然气行业**的一大胜利，该行业多年来一直试图阻止国家向可再生能源转型。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: But the change flies in the face of decades of scientific consensus around climate change that emissions have supercharged heat waves, droughts, wildfires, and other extreme weather events. It also marks a major success for the oil and gas industry, which has spent years trying to stop the country from transitioning to renewable energy.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 在2024年总统大选前夕，这些团体向**特朗普**及其盟友提供了估计7500万美元的资金。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: leading up to the 2024 presidential election. Those groups gave Trump and his allies an estimated $75 million.

</details>

### 象征意义事件

**Tracy Mumford**: “我们需要这里的所有人让开空间，以便我们的民选官员能够带着他们将要升起的旗帜通过。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Quote**: We need everybody here to make space so that our elected officials CAN GET THROUGH WITH THE FLAG THEY are going to raise.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 昨天在曼哈顿，一群人在**斯通沃尔国家纪念碑**（Stonewall National Monument）聚集，重新升起一面彩虹旗，此前该旗帜在**特朗普政府**的一项指令下被移除。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: In Manhattan yesterday, a crowd gathered at the Stonewall National Monument to put a pride flag back up after it was removed following a directive from the Trump administration.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: **美国内政部**最近发布了指导意见，处理在国家公园系统中“**非机构旗帜**”的展示问题。本周早些时候，在斯通沃尔附近工作的人们注意到彩虹旗不见了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Quote**: The Interior Department recently issued guidance addressing the display of quote non- agency flags in the National Park System. And earlier this week, people who work near Stonewall noticed the rainbow flag was gone.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: **斯通沃尔**近十年前被指定为国家纪念碑，以纪念1969年**LGBTQ**活动人士与警方之间发生的抗议和骚乱。当时警方突袭了一家名为斯通沃尔旅馆（Stonewall Inn）的同性恋酒吧。在**特朗普**执政期间，联邦政府广泛地审查了在公园和纪念碑上展示的语言和象征。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Stonewall was designated a national monument almost a decade ago in recognition of the protests and riots that happened there in 1969 between LGBTQ activists and police after police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar. Under Trump, the federal government has carried out a widespread effort to police the language and symbols displayed at parks and monuments.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 去年，国家公园管理局已命令多个地点移除与奴隶制和**美洲原住民**相关的材料。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: In the last year, the park service has ordered multiple sites to take down materials related to slavery and Native Americans.

</details>

### Meta 面部识别计划

**Tracy Mumford**: 《纽约时报》获悉，**Meta**，也就是**Facebook**的母公司，正计划在其**智能眼镜**中添加**面部识别功能**，此前曾因**隐私担忧**而搁置了之前的计划。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: The Times has learned that Meta, the parent company of Facebook, is planning to add a facial recognition feature to its smart glasses after scrapping previous plans amid privacy concerns. The glasses have been around for a few years. They're made with Rayban and Oakley and have a camera built into the frame.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 据四位参与该计划但未被授权公开谈论的人士透露，这款眼镜将能够通过**Meta的AI助手**识别人物并提供相关信息。该公司仍在探索眼镜将识别哪些人群。选项包括仅识别你在**Meta**平台（如**Instagram**）上的好友，或识别在这些网站上拥有公开账户的任何人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: According to four people involved with the plans who were not authorized to speak publicly, the glasses would be able to identify people and provide information about them via Meta's AI assistant. The company's still exploring what pool of people the glasses would identify. Options include only IDing people you're connected with on Meta platforms like Instagram or IDing everyone who has a public account on those sites.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 这并非**Meta**首次尝试这项技术。五年前，**Facebook**关闭了一个用于在照片中标记人物的面部识别系统，因为它引发了**隐私担忧**、政府调查和一个集体诉讼。该公司在2021年也曾考虑将这项技术应用于其早期版本的**智能眼镜**中，但因技术挑战和伦理问题而放弃。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: This isn't the first time Meta has experimented with this technology. 5 years ago, Facebook shut down a facial recognition system for tagging people in photos after it fueled privacy concerns, government investigations, and a class action lawsuit. It also considered putting the tech in one of its first versions of smart glasses back in 2021, but nixed that over technical challenges and ethical questions.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 现在，该公司正寻求再次尝试。**《纽约时报》**审阅了一份5月份的内部文件，该文件称，美国当前的政治动荡是发布该功能的“有利时机”。文件中写道：“我们将在一个充满活力的政治环境中推出，届时许多我们预计会攻击我们的公民社会团体，其资源将集中在其他事务上。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Now, the company's looking to try again. The Times reviewed an internal document from May, which said that the current political turmoil in the US was good timing for releasing the feature. It said, quote, "We will launch during a dynamic political environment where many civil society groups that we would expect to attack us would have their resources focused on other concerns."

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 针对《纽约时报》的提问，**Meta**表示它正在构建将“丰富人们生活”的产品，并写道，如果推出任何产品，它都会“采取深思熟虑的方法”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: In response to questions from the Times, Meta said it's building products that will help enrich people's lives and wrote that it will take a thoughtful approach if and before we roll anything out.

</details>

### 咖啡茶益智

**Tracy Mumford**: 最后，如果你现在正喝着早晨的咖啡，请尽情享用。它可能正在让你头脑更清晰，而且不是那种让你摆脱昏昏欲睡状态的短暂效果，而是长期的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And finally, if you are having your morning cup of coffee right now, drink up. It might be sharpening your mind, and not just in a making sure you're not a blur-eyed zombie kind of way, but in the long term.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 本周发布的一项大型新研究提供了**咖啡因咖啡和茶具有认知益处**的证据。该研究跟踪了超过10万名参与者很长时间，有时长达40多年，发现每天稳定饮用两到三杯咖啡或一到两杯茶的人，**患痴呆症的几率低于几乎不摄入咖啡因的人**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: A large new study published this week provides evidence of cognitive benefits from caffeinated coffee and tea. It followed over a 100,000 participants for a long time, in some cases more than 40 years, and found that people who consistently drank two to three cups of coffee a day or 1 to two cups of tea had lower chances of developing dementia than people who drank little to no caffeine.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 需要明确的是，这并不能证明咖啡因是导致这些有益效果的原因，但科学家表示，它可以**减少炎症**，这可能有助于保护大脑健康。研究还表明，咖啡因可以**改善胰岛素敏感性**，有助于预防**糖尿病**，而糖尿病是**痴呆症**的一个风险因素。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: To be clear, it doesn't prove caffeine is what causes those beneficial effects, but scientists say it can reduce inflammation, which might protect brain health. And research also suggests caffeine improves insulin sensitivity, helping protect against diabetes, which is a dementia risk factor.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 就饮用大量咖啡而言，研究发现结果在大约每天2.5杯左右就基本趋于平稳。无需过量饮用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: In terms of drinking a lot of coffee, the study found the results pretty much plateau at a certain point. No need to chug more than about 2 and 1/2 cups a day.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 总的来说，这可能是少数几个你发现每天做的事情可能对你并非坏事的时刻之一。所以，请享受吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Overall, this may be one of those rare moments where you learn something you do every day might not be terrible for you. So, enjoy it.

</details>

### 新闻测验

**Tracy Mumford**: 以上是今日新闻摘要。如果你想玩周五新闻测验，就在广告之后。今天在《每日新闻》节目中，关于**特朗普总统**的移民政策之争将几乎肯定导致午夜零时起实行有限政府停摆。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Those are the headlines. If you'd like to play the Friday news quiz, it is just after these credits. Today on the Daily, how the fight over President Trump's immigration policy will almost certainly cause a limited government shutdown starting at midnight tonight.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 本节目由 Will Jarvis、Yan Stewart 和我 Tracy Mumford 制作。原创主题曲由 Dan Powell 创作。特别感谢 Isabella Anderson、Lissa Anderson、Miles McKinley、Zoe Murphy 和 Paula Schuman。

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 现在，是时候进行测验了。我准备了几个关于《纽约时报》报道过的故事的问题，你能全部答对吗？我们开始吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Now, time for the quiz. Got a few questions for you about stories the Times has been covering. Can you get them all? Here we go.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 本周在白宫，**特朗普总统**为某个特定行业的代表团铺上了红地毯。一些是西装革履的行政人员，一些是穿着安全装备和头盔的工人。有一次……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: At the White House this week, President Trump rolled out the red carpet for a group from a specific industry. Some executives in suits, some workers in their safety gear and helmets. At one point

</details>

**Quote**: ……舞台，我们将为您颁发一个奖项，先生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Quote**: stage and we are going to present you an award, sir.

</details>

**Quote**: 非常感谢。一位高管上台，向总统赠送了一座奖杯，以表彰他对他们行业的承诺。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Quote**: Thank you very much. One of the execs got up on stage to give the president a trophy celebrating his commitment to their industry.

</details>

**Quote**: 先生，为了表达我们的感激之情，这个奖杯上写着“无可争议的……冠军”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Quote**: Sir, to show our appreciation, the uh trophy says the undisputed champion of

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: ……他们说**特朗普**是……的冠军？如果你需要提示，他们说他是“美丽清洁”的什么冠军？答案是……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: what did they say Trump is the champion of? If you need a hint, they said he's the champ of beautiful clean what? The answer.

</details>

**Quote**: 美丽清洁煤炭的无可争议的冠军。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Quote**: The undisputed champion of beautiful clean coal.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: **特朗普政府**一直专注于推动化石燃料，包括煤炭。今年，**内政部**甚至推出了一款吉祥物，一个插画形式的煤块，他们称之为他们能源政策的“代言人”。它被命名为“Coley”。真是费尽心思起了这个名字。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: The Trump administration has been focused on boosting fossil fuels, including coal. This year, the Interior Department's even been promoting a mascot, an illustrated lump of coal they say will be the quote spokespiece of coal for their energy policy. It is named Coley. Really dug deep for that one.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 下一个问题。现在可能是冬季奥运会期间，但在几个月后，在**拉斯维加斯**……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Next question. It may be all about the Winter Games right now, but in just a few months in Las Vegas,

</details>

**Quote**: 我们的目标不是打破世界纪录。我们的目标实际上是打破所有世界纪录。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Quote**: our goal is not to break a world record. Our goal is actually to break all the world records.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 一个名为“**增强运动会**”（enhanced games）的不同比赛将让来自世界各地的运动员相互较量，但有一个主要的转折。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: A different competition called the enhanced games will pit athletes from all over the world against each other with one major twist.

</details>

**Quote**: 人类潜力。那是什么潜力？极限在哪里？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Quote**: Human potential. What is that potential? Where is the max? Where's the limit?

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 你的问题是，是什么让它成为“**增强运动会**”？答案是，参赛者被允许使用**兴奋剂**。组织者表示他们正与医生密切合作以确保运动员的安全，但这因健康担忧而引发了广泛的谴责。尽管如此，这并没有阻止数十名运动员报名参加。他们被承诺每打破一项世界纪录可获得高达一百万美元的奖金。我们只能说，从品牌角度来看，“**增强运动会**”这个名字确实很贴切，但让我再提一个词……“**健壮奥运会**”（swole Olympics）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Your question, what makes it the enhanced games? The answer, the competitors are allowed to use performance-enhancing drugs. The organizers say they're working closely with doctors to keep athletes safe, but it has sparked widespread condemnation over health concerns. Still, that hasn't stopped dozens of athletes from signing up. They've been promised up to a million dollars for every world record they break. We'll just say branding wise, enhanced games is descriptive, I guess, but let me throw this one out there. the swole Olympics.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 最后一个问题，明天是情人节。别担心，你绝对还有时间假装你还记得。为了纪念这个节日，我们将测试你的情歌知识。但有一个陷阱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And last question, tomorrow is Valentine's Day. Don't worry, you absolutely still have time to pretend that you remembered. In honor of the holiday, we're going to test your love song knowledge. But there's a catch.

</details>

**Quote**: 我，一个AI机器人，将朗读歌词，因为我无法感受爱。你能说出这些著名歌曲的名字吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Quote**: I, an AI bot, will read the lyrics because I cannot feel love. Can you name these famous songs?

</details>

**Quote**: 如果我留下，我只会碍你的事。所以，我要走了，但我知道我每一步都会想着你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Quote**: If I should stay, I would only be in your way. So, I'll go, but I know I'll think of you every step of the way.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 我来帮你。答案是……**Whitney Houston**的《我将永远爱你》（I will always love you）。好了，下一首歌。机器人，请继续。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: I will help you out here. The answer, Whitney Houston, I will always love you. Okay, next song. Take it away, bot.

</details>

**Quote**: 像河流奔向大海，亲爱的，一切顺其自然。有些事你知道是命中注定。你的线索是答案。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Quote**: Like a river flows surely to the sea. Darling, so it goes. Some things you know are meant to be. Your clue the answer.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 那是**Elvis Presley**的《爱已坠入》（Can't Help Falling in Love）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: That's Help Falling in Love by Elvis Presley.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 还有最后一首，这首来自本世纪。
