### 访谈开场与公司介绍

**Nicolola Tangian**: 大家好，我是**挪威S1财富基金**的首席执行官**Nicolola Tangian**。今天我非常高兴，因为我邀请到了**Mala Gaonkar**，我们认识很久了。Mala创立了**SurgoCap Partners**，最初管理着18亿美元，现在已经达到60亿美元。在此之前，她在**Lone Pine Capital**担任创始合伙人长达23年，那是有史以来最成功的**对冲基金**之一。很高兴你能来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: Hi everybody. I'm Nicolola Tangian the CEO of the Norwegian S1 wealth fund and today I'm really happy because I'm here with Mala Gong Carr who I've known for a long time actually. Mala founded Sergo Cap with $1.8 billion and now it's at $6 billion and before that she spent 23 years as a founding partner of Lone Pine Capital, one of the most successful hedge funds of all times. Great to have you here.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 很高兴来到这里，Nikolai。谢谢你。请给我介绍一下你的公司**SurgoCap Partners**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Great to be here Nikolai. Thank you. Tell me about Sergio Cap partners your company.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 是的，**SurgoCap Partners**致力于实现许多投资公司都在努力的目标：在3到5年的周期内，以低于**市场**的**风险**来超越市场。这里的风险定义为**资本损失**，而非波动性。我们实现这一目标的方式是识别世界上极少数真正**优秀的企业**。我们的产品实际上是我们的流程，一个非常透明的流程，通过寻找非常具体的因素来实现。这些因素正如你之前指出的，是我在过去23年与业内最优秀的人士（我在**Lone Pine Capital**的前同事）一起投资过程中所犯的许多错误和学到的经验教训的结晶。这种经验的提炼形成了SurgoCap的理念。有许多不同的因素可以帮助识别一家真正卓越的企业，但我对优秀企业的定义是拥有非常**长久护城河**（long duration moats）的企业，而“长久”正是我们真正的差异化所在。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Yeah. Uh Serbo Cap tries to do what many investment firms try to do. It tries to beat the market uh over a 3 to 5 year cycle with less risk than the market. Risk defined as loss of capital, not volatility. Uh and the way we try to achieve that is by identifying this very small handful of truly great businesses that exist in the world. uh and we do that through a our product is really our process a very transparent process of uh looking for very specific factors that really are distillation as you pointed out earlier of my lessons I've learned the many mistakes and lessons I've learned uh from investing over 23 years with some of the best uh people in the business my former colleagues at at Lumpine and so that distillation has led to sero there are many different factors that lead to identification of a truly brilliant business but The way I define a great business is a business with very long duration modes and duration really is our true differentiation.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangian**: 那么，“护城河”是指它们难以被竞争，难以被超越。世界上有多少家这样的优秀公司呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: So mode being that it's difficult to compete with them. It's difficult to compete amount. How many great companies are there in the world?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 就像我说的，只有少数几家。我认为并没有那么多。我们主要关注四个垂直领域，我认为这些领域在某个特定因素上具有一定的优势。回顾我过去24年，现在是30年的投资经验，其中一个因素是**技术**——每个**企业**都是一家**技术企业**。所以，如果你是一家航空航天公司、一家医疗科技公司或一家金融数据公司，你的核心都是一家技术公司。如果你想大规模、高质量地交付产品，你就必须是一家技术企业。我认为理解企业的**技术栈图谱**（tech stack map）是我们花费大量时间研究的领域，尤其是在非科技企业中。

这是第一点。第二点是旧技术如何以全新的方式进行颠覆。比如我们讨论过的汽车行业，它雇佣的人数远超科技行业，但现在正被1976年发明的技术所颠覆，也就是**锂离子电池**。所以我认为这总是让我感到有趣。或者，当我们开始投资生涯时，我们购买**GPU**是为了让我们的视频游戏看起来更有趣一些，而现在它们正在推动我们时代最具颠覆性的社会、人口和技术变革之一，那就是**AI**。所以，旧技术如何以新方式进行颠覆，以及在非科技企业中寻找这种颠覆，也是我们投入大量时间研究的领域。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: As I said, a small handful. I don't think there are that many. We focus on really four verticals where I think there is a bit of an edge uh from a one very specific factor. So one back to the experience of what I've seen over 24 now 30 years of investing is techn every business is a technology business right so if you're an aerospace company or a medtech business or a financial data business you are a technology company in your backbone if you want to deliver at scale and with quality you have to be a tech business and I think understanding the tech stack map of businesses is something we spend a lot of time on especially in nontech businesses um I think that's one the second is how old technologies can disrupt in very new ways So if you think about something like we've talked about this but the auto industry which employs far more people in the tech industry but it's being disrupted right now by you know technology that was invented in 1976 you know the uh the the lithium ion battery. So I think that is that's always interesting to me or you know in when you know we started investing career we were buying GPUs to you know make our video games look a little little little more fun and then fast forward to now they're actually driving what's probably one of the more tectonic plate shifts in terms of you know social and demographic and technology shifts of our time which is AI. So I think how old technologies disrupt in new ways and looking for that in non- tech businesses is something we spent a lot of time on as well

</details>

### 基金的自我约束与团队规模

**Nicolola Tangian**: 我们稍后会回到这个话题，但当你设立**基金**时，你给自己施加了哪些自我约束？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: and we'll come back to this but just when you set up the fund what kind of self-imposed constraints do you did you put

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 是的，为了回答你关于我们如何识别这些真正优秀企业并保持这种纪律的问题，有几种方法可以做到。一是**专注**，所以我们决定我想保持**团队规模**小。如果说我从CEO们那里得到的一致建议（其中许多人也曾参与你的播客，无论他们是经营大公司、小企业还是创始人）就是保持团队规模小。所以这不仅仅是关于资产管理规模（AUM），显然，将一美元增值比将十亿美元增值更容易，但团队规模和保持团队规模小，并确保协作和跨界思维，这对于新想法的产生，特别是创意想法的产生，在我的脑海中是至关重要的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: yes so I in order to distill to your question about how we identify these truly great business and keeping that discipline there are a couple ways of of doing that um one is focus so we decided I wanted to keep the team small uh if there's a consistent piece of advice I got from CEOs many have been on this uh podcast with you whether they're running huge companies or small businesses or founders was to keep the team size small. So it's not just about aum it's obviously it's easier to multiply a dollar than it is to multiply a billion dollars but team size and keeping team size small and making sure that collaborative and crossber thinking which is so fruitful for new idea generation particularly creative idea generation that was paramount in my brain.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangian**: 多小才算小？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: How small is small?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 嗯，我们的投资团队，包括**数据科学**团队，我们定期围坐在这张桌子旁开会，这样我们就可以进行圆桌讨论。**Jeff Bezos**曾谈到过“两张披萨盒团队”。我想我们希望保持“一张披萨盒”的团队规模。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Um we have an investment team including the data science team and that we regularly meet table this size uh so that we can have a roundt discussion. Um you know Jeff Bezos has talked about sort of two two pizza box teams. I think we'd like to stay at one pizza box uh in terms of our our team size.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangian**: 一张披萨盒，每人一块披萨，我得说。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: One pizza box pizza per person I have to say.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 是的，没错。我们保持精简。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Yeah exactly. We keep things lean.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangian**: 我作为挪威人要说，我们是世界上最大的披萨消费国，据说每人11公斤。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: I'm saying that as a Norwegian we are the biggest pizza eating uh country in the world. 11 kilo per person supposedly.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 是吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Is that right?

</details>

**Nicolola Tangian**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: Yeah. Yeah.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 嗯，有意思。我从未预料到这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Um Interesting. I've never predicted that.

</details>

### 数据科学的应用与投资偏见

**Nicolola Tangian**: 但当你将你的公司与其他科技投资者进行比较时，你认为有什么不同？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: But when you look at when you look at your company relative to other tech investors, what would you say is the difference?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我们关注的是技术与非技术业务的交集，以及旧技术如何以新方式进行颠覆。这是一个角度。我们还会查看竞争、客户和其他方面的常规清单。我想说，另一个重要的教训是关于**偏见**，以及我们现在如何能够以我们刚开始投资生涯时无法做到的方式运用**数据科学**。考虑到现在**机器学习**的速度之快和开源程度之高，你可以非常经济高效地创建非常强大的第三方数据检查，包括**自动化调查**，以及对市场和技术采用的各种数据点进行**自动化跟踪**。这在我们职业生涯早期，也就是90年代末，是无法做到的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: We're looking at where techn is intersecting with non-technology businesses and where, as I said, old technology is disrupting uh in new ways. Uh so that's one angle. We look at the the usual checklist of competitive and customer and other checks. I would say the other big lesson is really around biases and how you can use data science today in a way we couldn't when we started our investment careers. uh given how fast and how open source now machine learning is, you can very cost-effectively create uh very strong uh third-party data checks uh including automated surveys um including you know automated tracking uh of various data points around markets and tech adoption that we could not very early on in the you know the late 90s when we're setting up our careers.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangian**: 给我举个例子，现在你能做而以前不能做的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: Give me an example on the kind of thing you can do now that you couldn't do earlier.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 嗯，非常具体地说，如果你想追踪产品采用情况，当我们刚开始的时候，比如98年我们创立**Lone Pine Capital**时，我当时在研究一些早期产品采用情况，即使是像**Adobe**产品在当时刚刚向云端转型时，那也是一个非常手动化的过程。你得出去打电话给客户，进行调查，调查通常通过电话进行，回复率也很难追踪。现在，我们实际上可以使用**调查机器人**来做这些事情。我们实际上可以结合使用增强型人工调查员，并进行更深入的挖掘。我们可以通过**机器学习**以非常自动化的方式追踪更多数量的产品SKU。我们可以**抓取网页**，明确地说，这在当时还没有达到今天的规模和范围，来查看产品采用情况，查看哪些公司对其供应商开放了API，哪些没有。所以，现在有一系列的技术栈图谱、产品采用、客户采用，甚至超出典型的消费者采用数据，这些数据现在在消费者世界中被非常严格地追踪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Um so very specifically if you want to track sort of product adoption when we started out you know when we started lumpine 98 when I was looking at uh some of the early adoptions even say around Adobe products back in the day when they were just transitioning to cloud that was a very manual process. You went out you called customers you did surveys surveys were usually done by phone response rates were trickier to track. Um now we actually can use survey bots to do these things. We can actually have a combination of both uh augmented human surveyors as well as looking at some of the deeper dives. We can track through machine learning in a very automated way a larger number of product SKs. We can scrape the web which to be clear wasn't at the scale and scope of what it is today to see product adoptions to see who has open APIs to their suppliers who doesn't. Um so there's a whole range of both techstack mapping, product adoption, customer adoption even outside the typical consumer adoption data that is tracked uh pretty religiously now as you know within the consumer world.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangian**: 你认为未来的**投资组织**会更小吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: Do you think investment organizations will be smaller in the future?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我认为会的，而且它们可能也应该如此，因为我确实认为**人类协作**在较小的规模下效果最好。我认为一些最有趣的数据和一些最有趣的想法是通过跨行业边界的观察而产生的。例如，**AI**如何影响**医疗科技**，AI如何影响航空航天领域的**材料科学创新**。我认为这些角度比单纯地将AI视为技术本身内部的AI更具趣味性，或者说同样具有趣味性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: I suspect they will be and they probably should be because I do think there is something about human collaboration that works best at a smaller scale. I think some of the most interesting datas and some of my interesting ideas come through looking across borders across the borders of industry. So how AI is influencing medtech, how AI is influencing material science innovation in aerospace. I think those are more interesting angles in or just as interesting angles as purely looking at AI as AI within technology itself.

</details>

### AI的颠覆性应用

**Nicolola Tangian**: 你在你的公司中看到了哪些最反直觉的**AI**益处？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: What are the most what are some of the most counterintuitive benefits of AI that you are seeing in your companies?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我认为**医疗技术**领域正在发生的事情可能没有得到应有的广泛理解。举一个非常具体的例子，如果你看看**成像**领域，比如**MRI**、**CT扫描**等，这些图像的准确性和速度现在正以近70%的速度提高，这与几年前的情况相比有了显著进步。在全球人口老龄化的背景下，这对于治疗性护理和预防性护理都非常有帮助，而且显然，这使得整体护理更具成本效益。

所以我认为这是一个围绕成像的重大领域，它能更早地了解这些**慢性疾病**是如何演变的，并能够及早遏制它们。

另一个重要领域是关于**手术**的进行方式。人们谈论**AI**和**机器人技术**在制造业中的交集。但我认为人们有时没有意识到的是，全球每年进行约3亿例手术。而这些手术才刚刚开始被**机器人手术**所渗透，特别是像**Intuitive Surgical**这样的公司。

所以我认为这是另一个重要的类别，你开始看到真正的创新正在发生，其中**触觉反馈**、**映射软件**以及围绕手术本身更好的技术相结合，真正带来了更低的错误率，更简单的医学生培训，以及整体上更好的治疗护理环境。正如你所知，关于如何控制**医疗成本**存在很大的讨论，我希望智能地应用AI能够对此有所帮助。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: I think the uh what is happening within u medical technologies is is not perhaps as well or broadly understood as it should. So to give you a very specific uh instance uh if you look at the imaging space so you know MRIs, CT scans and so on the accuracy and the speed at which these images can be uh conducted are now improving at a pace of almost 70%. Uh versus what we would have even a few years ago. that in an aging demographic globally has been incredibly helpful for not just therapeutic care but preventive care and in a way that makes obviously overall care much more cost-effective. Um so I think that is one big area around imaging uh and really understanding earlier how some of these chronic diseases are are evolving and able and I think obviously nipping these in the butt earlier has been one big one. The other big area uh has been uh around how uh surgery is conducted. So I think the intersection people talk about AI and robotics in the manufacturing space. What I think people don't realize sometimes is there about 300 million surgeries conducted globally. Uh and they're just beginning to be penetrated uh by you know what's happening with robotic surgery specifically you know companies like intuitive surgical. Um so I think that is another big category uh where you're beginning to see real innovation happening where the combination of um haptic feedback um mapping software better technologies around uh surgical conduct itself are really leading to uh a lower error easier training for medical students and a overall better context uh for how these uh therapeutic carees can be conducted and as you know there's a big discussion obviously around uh how healthcare costs can be contained and I have some hopes that AI applied intelligently can can can help with this.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 嗯，所以是的，我认为从广义上讲，技术如何与非技术业务交叉，以及如何利用数据来分析并消除人类决策过程中的偏见，是我们投入大量时间研究的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Um, so yeah, I think I think broadly this idea of how technology is intersecting with non-technology businesses and how you can use data to analyze that and debias the very human decision-m process something we spent a lot of time on.

</details>

### 投资集中度与核心领域

**Nicolola Tangian**: 非常有趣。你现在相信**集中度**。当你决定投资某物时，你会投入相当大的比重，对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: Very interesting. Now you believe in concentration. You have quite big when you when you go for something you go pretty big, right?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 正确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Correct.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangian**: 嗯，告诉我你是如何思考集中度的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: What um tell me how you think about concentration.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我非常有意地专注于这四个垂直领域，它们恰好是**企业数据**（广义上的科技）、**金融服务**和**医疗保健服务**，以及**工业技术**。因为我觉得这些领域是**新兴技术颠覆**主题最相关的领域，也是你可以看到拥有非常**持久护城河**的市场领导者的地方，在这些领域，增量回报以及你可以投入到这些增量回报中的**资本**，在当前所有技术趋势下，都有更清晰的路径。所以我们纯粹只关注这四个领域。我们也会考虑**主题性风险敞口**。我认为原因很简单。首先，我认为这让你能够在某个时刻或由于市场结构日益被动的性质，以及偶尔出现的因素轮动可能扰乱投资组合时，采取**进攻**策略。我们相信，在这四个行业中的每一个，都存在足够有趣的投资理念，我们不会妥协，而且每个名称的长期投资逻辑都有非常不同的驱动因素。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: I very intentionally set on these four verticals just happen to be uh enterprise data so tech broadly um financial services and healthcare services as well as industrial technologies because I felt those were the areas where these themes of um emerging technology disruption were most relevant and where you could see market leaders with very durable modes where incremental returns and the capital you could put to work at those incremental returns had a clearer path given all the technology trends we're seeing. today. So we purely just focus on those four areas. We also think about thematic exposure as well. And the reason for that I think is very simple. Um one I think that allows you to play offense when at some point or the other due to you know the passive nature of the market structure now increasingly the odd factor rotation here or there could disrupt uh a portfolio that allows us to play offense during those periods. And we believe there is actually sufficiently interesting set of investment ideas across each of these four sectors where we're not compromising uh and we have very different drivers of the long thesis of each of these names.

### 投资的“调味品”：质量与系统性思维

**Nicolola Tangian**: 你在印度长大，我曾听你在一个播客上谈论食物。那么，你是如何为投资组合“调味”的呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: Now you uh grew up in India and I heard you on a podcast once talking about food. So how do you how how do you spice up the portfolio?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我认为对我们来说，“调味品”就是**质量**。所以，我认为我们拥有真正具有**长久护城河**的企业，并且我们有非常**去偏见的数据追踪**方式，这不仅仅基于我的直觉或团队的直觉，而是真正基于**系统性思维**，而不是**孤立思维**。这就是让我感到非常兴奋的“调味品”，因为这是一个非常难以思考和做好的事情。我认为，我们谈论这个很重要，Nikolai，你是一个真正的投资过程的学生，但我们都喜欢**Kahneman**和**Tversky**的理论工作，对吧？我记得我父亲曾给我引用**Bertrand Russell**的一句名言：“人类会尽一切可能避免思考。”这很简单，就像Kahneman谈到的**系统一思维**和**系统二思维**。系统一思维是那种直觉的、凭感觉的思考，坦率地说，它是积极的。它驱动人类日常生活中非常快速流畅的反应，而且运行得很好。但系统二思维，它真正深入细节，真正有条不紊地、逻辑地思考，这真的很难。所以我努力确保我的团队和我们的投资组合是由**系统二思维**驱动的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: I think the spice for us is quality. So I think we have really moed long duration businesses and we have very debiased ways of tracking the data where it's not just based on my intuition or the team's intuition um but really based on you know systemic thinking and not siloed thinking. That's the spice that seems really exciting to me because then that's a really hard thing to think about and do well. And I thinking I think it's it's important for us to talk about this a little bit and you're a real student of the investment process Nikolai but you know we're both we both love the sort of Kaman Ferriski theor work right and um I remember my father once giving me this great quote from Bertrren Russell which is humans will do anything they can to not have to think and it's very simple like Kaman talks about system one and system two thinking and system one thinking is that intuitive gut thinking that frankly is positive. It drives very quick fluid reactions from humanity dayto-day and it works perfectly fine. But system two thinking which is really getting into the weeds and really thinking methodically and logically is really hard. And so I try to focus on making sure my team and our portfolio is driven by system two thinking.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangian**: 这里我需要插一句，我之前曾为你做过一次采访，那是为了我的硕士论文，主题正是**决策制定**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: Here I need to interject that I have actually interviewed you once before for my master's thesis in

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 哦，对了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Oh, that's right.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangian**: 那正是关于何时使用直觉，何时使用分析。那么，在你的职业生涯中，你对**模式识别**的使用方式有何改变？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: in in decision-m which was exactly about that. you know when do you use uh you know intuition and when do you when do you use analysis? So how has your use of pattern recognition changed during your career?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我认为我的**模式识别**已经从较少受个体分析观点驱动，更多地转向思考**背景**。所以我可能过度强调了个人、CEO或领导力，或者说“英雄模式”，而低估了公司和企业运营所处的强大社会背景。我通过艰难的方式学到了这一点。我经历过很多失败，但我第一份工作，你知道，在**世界银行**担任初级分析师，在**俄罗斯**和**蒙古**工作时，我当时的想法，这是一个特别深刻的例子。我当时认为：“好的，太棒了。我们要接管这些**国有企业**。我们要给它们估值。我们要通过各种地方银行分支机构分发股票。开放**股票市场**。砰！**资本主义**，**自由民主**，一切都会很棒。历史的终结，大功告成。”

结果却有些不同，对吧？我们反而看到了非常**腐败**行为的兴起。我们看到了这些国家**专制**的崛起，我们知道今天的新闻头条仍在报道这些。你不能脱离或抽象掉70年的**共产主义历史**，简单地假设人们会有一个全新的思维框架。所以我认为今天也是如此，当你自下而上地审视企业时，你真的必须思考非常强大的整体背景。你必须同时拥有“右眼看望远镜”和“左眼看显微镜”，才能真正系统性地、清晰地思考企业将如何在它们所处的背景下演变。所以，这是我经常思考的问题，即我们如何解决这些非常具体的思维失败。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: My pattern recognition um has I think expanded from being less driven by individual analyt analytical viewpoints and more to thinking about the context. And so I've probably over uh emphasized the person and uh the CEO or the leadership or kind of the hero model and underemphasized the very powerful social context in which companies businesses were operating. Um and uh I learned this the hard way. I've had plenty of failures, but my first job, you know, working in uh in in in Russia and Mongolia as a junior analyst with the World Bank, um you know, I I came in there, this is this is particularly poignant example. I came in there thinking, "Okay, great. We're going to take these stateowned enterprises. We're going to value them. We're going to distribute tickets through the various local bank branches, open up the stock market. Boom. Capitalism, liberal democracy, it's all going to be awesome. The end of history done." What happened was a little bit different, right? We had instead a rise of very corrupt practices. Um we had the rise of autotocracy uh across across these countries and we know the headlines today still speak of these. You cannot take away or abstract away from 70 years of you know communist history and simply assume that people are going to just you know have a new framework of thinking. So I think the same is true today like you really have to think about the very powerful overall context as you're looking bottoms up at businesses. you have to have almost the right eye and the telescope and the left eye and the microscope uh to really think uh systemically and clearly about um how these how how businesses will evolve in the context in which they are in today. So that's something I think think a lot about is is is how do we address these very specific failures of our thinking.

### 投资私营公司与新想法的来源

**Nicolola Tangian**: 你也可以投资**私营公司**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: You can also invest uh in uh private companies.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Yes.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangian**: 你为什么选择能够这样做？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: Why did you choose to be able to do that?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我认为我们显然知道存在非常大的**市值**，在私营领域存在非常大的企业，我们也知道**公开市场**上的企业数量比以往任何时候都少。所以撇开这些趋势不谈，我认为考虑私营市场的另一个原因是它们往往最具**颠覆性**。变革总是发生在边缘，而不是核心，对吧？这是我的基本观点。而边缘实际上就是那些小型公司、私营公司、那些刚刚崭露头角的无名创始人。那才是边际变革真正发生的地方。所以，确保我们的网络和思维过程不仅在美国，而且在全球范围内，在我们关注的这四个大行业类别中都存在，我认为这是我们义不容辞的责任，与私营公司交流就是这个过程的一部分。就这么简单。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: I think some of the we obviously know uh about the very large market caps that exist, very large businesses exist in the private realm and we know about the fact that there are fewer businesses that are out there in the public markets uh than have been for a while. Um so those trends aside, I think another reason to look at the private markets is because they're often the most disruptive. Change always happens at the edges, not at the core, right? And that's my fundamental view. And the edge is is really the small company, the private company, the unsung founder who's just emerging. That's really where change at the margin will happen. So making sure that we have our networks and thought processes out there, not just in the US, but globally within these four areas that we focus on, these four big industry categories we focus on is something that I think is incumbent upon us and talking to private companies as part of that process. It's as simple as that.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangian**: 你是如何产生想法的？比如你早上醒来，然后突然想到要研究某个东西？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: How do you come up with ideas? So you wake up in the morning and then it's like bang, I want to look at that.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 这不是早上醒来就突然想到要研究某个东西。这实际上是一个更长的过程。对我来说，想法有一个漫长的**孵化**过程。所以我读很多书。我认为，我与我的团队交流。我与我们所有人都能接触到的更广泛的网络交流。但回到关于变革发生在边缘的观点。这实际上是关于深入实地。它是关于去参加那些鲜为人知的**行业贸易展**，那些展示新型机器人系统自动化的展会，在那里你可能会得到一个新想法。它可能是一个小组讨论，或者我们自基金成立以来一直在进行的针对非科技行业**AI开发者**的定期调查，以了解他们实际在做什么，哪些尝试有效，哪些无效。所以，我想说，我最好的想法往往来自更不寻常的视角，而不是你所期望的，仅仅与现有的大佬们交流，尽管那显然也很重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: It's not a wake up in the morning and bang, I'll look at that. it's really a longer duration. Um, you know, there's there's a long incubation process, I think, for me of ideas. So, I read a lot. I think, you know, uh, I talk to my team. I talk to, uh, the broader networks that, uh, we all have access to out there. But then, back to the point about change happening at the edge. It's really about going out in the field. It's about going to that, you know, obscure industry trade show that happens to feature automation of, you know, new robotic systems where you might get a new idea. It might happen to be uh this panel, this regular ongoing survey we've done since before our launch of AI developers in non- techch industries to see what are they actually working on, what are they actually trying out that's working, that's not working. Um so it's really uh I would say from more obscure lenses that I get my best ideas versus what you would expect, you know, just just talking to uh the existing power players, although that's obviously important as well.

### 投资决策流程与偏见管理

**Nicolola Tangian**: 那么你有了想法之后，你会怎么做？下一步是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: So then you have an idea. What do you do with it?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 下一步就是，回到你之前关于直觉、**系统一思维**与**系统二思维**的问题，就是将它通过一个非常精细的过滤器，也就是整体的**投资清单**。我非常相信**清单驱动**的方法。我们会走完这个清单，然后，除了我关于**偏见**的观点之外，还要确保我们有一种方法来追踪投资论点，并确保我们能够坚持这个论点。原因在于，我认为我们非常容易受到一些色彩斑斓的偏见的影响，无论是**确认偏误**、**可得性偏误**还是**沉没成本偏误**。我回顾我犯过的许多投资错误，它们都与这些偏见中的一个或另一个有关。它们非常人性化，也很自然，并且有一些积极的方面。但对于投资来说，可能就没那么积极了。所以我想确保有一个数据点可以附着我们的投资论点，这个数据点是无偏见的，这样投资团队和我就可以追踪它，并确保我们不会仅仅假设那些可能成为论点阻碍的问题会消失。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: The next step is to to your point uh your question earlier about intuition system one versus system two thinking is then to put it through a very fine filter of the overall check investment checklist. I very much believe in a kind of a checklist driven approach. um we go through that and then in addition uh to my qu my my point about biases making sure we have a way to track the thesis uh and make sure that we are we can hold on to that rope and the reason for that is uh I think we are very subject to some very colorfully named biases right whether it's confirmation bias or availability bias or some cost bias I've you know when I look across my many investment mistakes uh they've all been you know one or the other of these biases and they're very human and they're natural and they have some positive aspects But for investing maybe a bit less so. So I'd like to make sure that there's a data point that we can attach our investment thesis to that's unbiased so that the investment team and I can track this and make sure that we're you know we're we're we're not uh just assuming uh issues that might be headwinds to the thesis away.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我在这方面花了很多时间。我还花了很多时间确保我们不会犯**遗漏错误和委托错误**。所以，我很多时间也在思考，有哪些假设可能是错误的，事情可能在哪里出错，市场颠覆可能在哪里发生。所以，这是我花费同样多时间思考的问题。而**FOMO**（错失恐惧症）可能是最大的，对吧？所以我喜欢告诉我的团队，不要从FOMO转向**TOMO**（深思熟虑地错过），确保我们正在审视无论是**加密货币**、**量子计算**还是其他任何流行事物。也许我们可以尝试扩大我们的**能力圈**，但如果不能，就要明确我们的能力圈是什么。不断向外拓展，但要非常清楚这些界限在哪里，不要越界。所以，我想说，我的想法更多是关于引导团队，而不是关于具体的股票。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Uh and uh I spent a lot of time on that. I spent a lot of time also making sure you know we're talking about errors of omission and commission but I also want to make sure we don't get into make mistakes. So, a lot of my time is also thinking about what are the assumptions that are being made out there that could possibly be wrong, where could things go astray, where could market disruptions happen. Uh, and so that's something I spend just as much time on. And FOMO is probably the biggest, right? So, I like to tell my team it's not let's move from FOMO to tomo, thoughtfully missing out, making sure that we're looking at whatever it happens to be, crypto or quantum or whatever the flavor of the day might be. Maybe we can try and expand our circle of competence, but if we can't, making it clear what our circle of competence is. Keep pushing it out, but be very clear about what those lines are and not overstepping them. So, I think I would say my ideas are as much about uh steering the team as they are about specific stocks.

**Nicolola Tangian**: 你如何使用他们？他们是做决策还是支持你的决策？

**Nicolola Tangian**: How do you use them? How do you um do they make decisions or they support you in your decision-m?

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我有一个非常有经验的团队。我很幸运能与这少数真正优秀的人合作，他们每个人都有十年左右的做多和做空股票的经验。我真的把他们当作**合作者**。我真的认为他们对我的决策过程非常重要。在我看来，这非常像一项团队运动。所以你确实需要一个强大的团队。我把自己更多地看作是一个**教练**和**导师**的角色。我希望**SurgoCap**的一个重要驱动力是，我能够吸引和培养下一代真正优秀的投资人才。

**Mala Gaonkar**: I have a very experienced team. I'm very lucky to work with this small handful of of of truly excellent people who have had, you know, decade or so each of of long and short stock making experience. Uh, and I really use them as collaborators. I really think of them as people that are very important to my decision-making process. And uh, I could not this is very much a team sport in my view. And so you do need that strong team. Uh, and I view myself as much a coaching uh, and mentoring role. And one of the big drivers of circle cap I hope is that I can attract and mentor uh the next generation of really great investment talent.

### 深思熟虑地错过：红旗与市场叙事

**Nicolola Tangian**: 那么，**深思熟虑地错过**（TOMO）的**红旗**是什么，会让你远离某个投资？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Gaonkar**: So um thoughtfully missing out what are the red flags that will keep you away from something?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 一是**妥协**。如果你觉得你投资一家企业仅仅是因为纯粹的**估值**，或者你投资一家企业是因为你认为创始人是下一个救世主，但存在其他问题，你却打算将其“抹平”。所以，本质上，在投资决策中过于**情绪化**。每当我看到这种情况，有时甚至我自己对某件事过于兴奋时，我都会认为这是一个红旗，需要确保我们以非常平衡和深思熟虑的方式思考企业的所有方面，而不是仅仅关注某一点。我认为这就是偏见非常内在的地方，因为作为人类，我们非常习惯于寻找那个激动人心的大时刻或事物，我们就是这样进化的，对吧？我们当时在寻找即将扑向我们的捕食者。但实际上，我认为在现代世界，事情并非那么简单。事实上，它极其复杂，有多种因素可能成功，也可能失败。花时间全面考虑这些因素是我确保我们做到的事情，而当我没有做到时，我就会犯错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Uh one is compromise. So if you feel that you are only buying a investing in a business because of pure valuation or you're investing in a business because you think the founder is the next messiah but there are other issues but you're going to kind of smooth those away. So, you know, basic essentially uh being overly emotional uh in terms of the investment decision-m whenever I see that when I when I sometimes when I get too excited about something even I think that's a red flag to make sure that we're really thinking in a very balanced and thoughtful way about all the aspects of a business uh as opposed to just focusing on one and I think that's where the bias is very inherent by you know as humans we're very trained to look for that one big exciting moment or thing uh that's how we evolved right? We were looking for the predator that was about to pounce on us. Um, but in reality, I think in the modern world, uh, it is not that simple. In fact, it's incredibly complex and there's a multiplicity of factors that could go right and could go wrong. And spending time in that full gamut is something I make sure we do and I make mistakes when I don't. It

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 确实不容易将**情绪**排除在外。我确实认为你需要一套方法论和流程，将其纳入你的**系统二思维**，并创建工具，以便你和你的团队能够朝这个方向努力。然后，记住市场本身的性质，股票的波动既受**叙事**驱动，也受**数字**驱动。所以你必须尊重这种背景，并欣赏这种背景。回到我之前关于背景的观点，即使在苏联解体前的最后日子里，它的力量也是如此强大。所以，我认为这也是我们需要平衡的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: It's not easy to leave emotions out of it. I do think you need to have a methodology and a process to bring that into your system to thinking and and creating tools so that you and your team can nudge that way. Um and then remember uh back to the nature of the markets themselves, stocks move as much a narrative as they move on numbers. So you have to be respectful of that context and just be appreciative of the cont. back to my point about context uh in even the the late dying days of the Soviet Union and how powerful that was. Um so I think that's something we need to balance as well.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangian**: 你提到了**护城河**，长期护城河，作为**质量**的定义。你还关注哪些其他类型的质量标志？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: You mentioned uh MOAT uh long-term moat um as a as a definition of quality. What are the other type of quality signs you're looking at?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 是的。那么，当我说护城河时，我指的是什么呢？我指的是一家拥有非常高的**增量投资资本回报率**（incremental ROIC）的企业，因为归根结底，一家企业的价值将是增量投资资本的回报率乘以你可以投入到这些增量回报中的资金，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Yeah. So uh when I say mode, what do I mean by that? I mean a business that has very high uh incremental ROIC's because ultimately the value of a business is going to be the return on incremental invested capital times the do dollars you can put to work at those incremental returns right

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 所以，这是一种平衡，既要看是什么驱动了**ROIC**，又要看它有多少种驱动方式。如果仅仅是靠提价，我不喜欢那样。但如果是靠提价，同时有**功能创新**，有**市场增长**，或者有**新地域**、**新产品**，那就太棒了。所以，多重因素驱动ROIC是其一。第二是你可以投入到这些增量回报中的**资本**。有许多企业，不，不是许多，但有一些优秀企业拥有高增量回报，但它们可以投入到这些增量回报中的资本正在减少，增长市场不存在。所以，要努力理解这是哪种类型的企业。

然后，即使它们确实有很多资本可以投入，我们今天在科技领域也看到了这一点，**执行风险**是巨大的。所以，我认为我们需要确保我们为投入的资本水平获得相应的回报水平，而不是仅仅看现有业务的销售额和规模，因为那会增加执行风险，而执行风险是我非常需要考虑的。所以，我认为增量回报、可以投入到这些增量回报中的资本，以及拥有多个杠杆来管理其中一个的积极因素和另一个的执行风险的负面因素，这就是我们所思考的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: so it's a balance of what is driving that ROI I see and multiply you know there multiple ways are really the best ways right so if it's just by driving a price I don't love that but if it's driving a price and there's feature innovation and there's market growth or new geographies or new products that's great so multip multiple believers on driving ROIC is one. The second is the capital you can put to work at those incremental returns. There are many businesses that have you know not many but there's some great business have high incremental returns but the capital they can put to work at those incremental returns are diminishing. the growth market isn't there and so trying to understand what category of business that is and then even if they do have a lot of capital they can put to work and we're seeing this in the technology space today execution risk is enormous and so I think we need to make sure that we're getting the level of return for that level of capital being put to work versus the the sales and size of the existing business today because that increases execution risk which is a risk I very much need to think about. So I think that combination of incremental returns capital you can put to work in those incremental returns having multiple levers to both manage the positives in one and the negatives of execution risk in the other is what we think about.

### 优秀投资案例与AI芯片层

**Nicolola Tangian**: 那么，不谈论你现在投资组合中的任何东西，但举一个你曾经有过，并且符合这些条件的优秀投资案例。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: So um without uh talking about anything you own in the portfolio just now but um an example of a great investments that you have had which would kind of tick some of these boxes.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 是的。嗯，我想说，更广泛的，你知道，我们在我之前的职位上也有过一些这样的投资。这是这些企业最棒的方面。我认为现在真正有趣的是**芯片堆栈**（chip stack）正在发生的事情。所以我们在这方面花了很多时间。嗯，所以你知道，像**台积电**（TSMC）这样的知名企业，它们真正做到了……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Yeah. Um I would say the uh broader you know and we've had some of these investments in my prior role as well. This is the great aspect of these businesses. Um I think what's really interesting right now is what's happening with the chip stack. So we've been spending a lot of time on that. Um so you have you know businesses like TSM that are well known that have really kind of

</details>

**Nicolola Tangian**: 台湾的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: there's a Taiwan

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 台湾的角落，那种**工艺工程**方面。所以它不仅仅是关于一件事，而是关于多件事。所以我喜欢那种**系统性护城河**，它不是只有一个简单的小东西，不是你只拥有镇上唯一的金矿。而是你拥有围绕金矿如何开采的整个过程。所以，我认为我喜欢那些具有这种动态的企业。

我还认为现在**AI芯片层**正在发生一些非常有趣的事情，人们谈论了很多关于**训练**（AI models）的话题，但我认为训练有点不稳定，而**推理**（AI models）才是年金流，对吧？最终，这是我们日复一日地调用模型来做的事情，这些将存在于特定的**LLM**中，**Google**将拥有自己的推理堆栈，**OpenAI**、**Anthropic**等公司也将拥有。我认为**Google的TPU**（Tensor Processing Unit）周围发生的事情在减少这方面非常有趣。所以我认为**ASIC芯片**（Application-Specific Integrated Circuits），即为特定类型工作负载设计的专用芯片，以及围绕它们发生的事情，创造了非常**长久护城河**。所以我们一直非常关注这种主题。

我们之前谈到了**医疗技术**，但我确实认为**进入市场护城河**（go-to-market moats）与不断复合的**流程创新**相结合，并嵌入到全球医生、执业护士的庞大群体中，实际执行这些工作，也创造了很大的**粘性**。所以，我认为这是另一个领域，真正优秀的企业正在涌现、形成并已经形成。所以，这些可能是芯片堆栈层和医疗技术领域正在发生的两个大类，它们在过去20年里发挥了作用。所以这些都不是新的。我认为，还有另一个有趣的类别，人们认为AI可能比实际情况更具颠覆性。因此，在**实时数据**和**数据分析**领域，有一些专有数据提供商，我们认为它们非常有趣，是非常棒的企业，它们同时拥有**记录系统**和**工作流系统**，并结合了一个非常基本的**创新引擎**。这三者的结合通常会创造出非常持久的优势。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: corner in Taiwan kind of the process engineering aspects of that. So it's not really just about one thing it's all about multiple things. So I love that sort of systemic modes where there isn't just one little simple uh it's not you just own the gold only gold mine in town. It's that you own the process around uh how how how the gold mine is is extracted. So I think we I I I like businesses that have those kinds of those dynamics to them. I also think there's something really interesting happening now in the in the chip layer in AI where um there's been a lot of talk about training but I think you know training is a little spiky but inference is the is the annuity stream right ultimately this is what we're going to be calling on the models to do day in day out and those are going to be within specific LLMs Google will have its own inference stack um open AAI uh anthropic and others and I think what is happening around Google's TPU is really interesting in terms of reducing that so I I think um AS6 or ASIC chips application specific chips that are designed for specific types of workloads and what's happening around that creates very long duration modes and so we've been focusing a lot in that kind of thematic. We talked about medical technologies earlier but I do think the combination of go to market modes combined with you know process innovation that just keeps compounding embedded in a large pool of you know global doctors nurse practitioners out there actually executing creates a lot of you know stickiness as well. So I think that's another area of of sort of where great businesses uh are are really emerging and forming and have formed. Um so those are probably two big buckets in what's happening around the chip stack layer which have really and and the medtech which have played off the last 20 years. So these are not new these are I think um there's another interesting category as well where there's a view that AI is maybe disrupting a little bit more than it actually is. And so I think within sort of real- time data and data analytics, there's some proprietary data providers we we uh I think are really interesting and are really terrific businesses where they have both the system of record and the system of workflow from combined and that combined with a very basic innovation engine. Those three combined often create very durable.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangian**: 那会是什么类型的公司？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: What type of companies would that be?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 那么，这些公司会是提供例如**金融数据**的企业。所以想想，即使是为你的投资组合，所有用于**外汇清算**、**固定收益**或**股票市场**所需的实时定价。我认为这些都是**实时数据**，对于**LLM**来说，例如，由于其实时性质，很难被颠覆。但这嵌入在围绕**交易**和**合规**的实际工作流中，我认为这些工作流也很难被颠覆。所以，我认为有一种看法认为这些可以被AI模型“刮走”，但我认为这几乎是我很难看到或理解的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: So those would be businesses um that provide for example financial data. So think about um even for um your portfolio uh all of the real-time pricing that's needed for FX clearance or for fixed income or for the equity markets. I think those are real-time data very hard for a LLM for example to ever disrupt because of the real-time nature of that. But that's embedded in real workflows around trading and compliance that I think are very hard to disrupt as well. Um so I think there's a perception that those can be scraped away uh by the AI uh models but I think that's almost very hard for me to see or understand.

### 投资时间跨度与做空

**Nicolola Tangian**: 你在投资或思考投资时，会设定什么样的**时间跨度**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: What kind of time horizon do you have when you invest or when you think about investments

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 对于做多方面，当然是尽可能长。嗯，**做空**显然不同。它们更多是**催化剂驱动**的，通常倾向于有大约九个月以下的催化剂周期。但对于做多方面，正如我所说，我信任我们的流程来关注**持续时间**。所以我们真正关注的是，正如我所说，驱动增量回报的因素组合，以及可以投入到这些增量回报中的资本，这些因素肯定会在3到5年的周期内发挥作用，就我们的估值范围而言，但理想情况下，我们看到超越这个范围的杠杆。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: for as long as possible on the long side obviously um shorts are obviously different. They're more catalyst driven and usually tend to have sort of you know sub ninemonth kind of catalyst periods but on the long side as I said uh I trust our process to look at duration. So we're really looking as I said for that combination of factors driving incremental returns and capital that can be put to work at those incremental returns that really are playing out certainly over 3 to 5 year cycle in terms of our valuation horizon but ideally we see levers beyond that.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangian**: 做空与**长期投资**相比如何？同一个人能同时做这两件事吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: How uh does shorting compare with long investing? Can the same person do both?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 这是一个很好的问题，因为它确实是做多方面的反向肌肉。正如你所知，它真正思考的是，所以有时你会清楚地看到，做空是做多的破碎镜像：X赢了，Y输了。但我发现这种情况非常罕见，而且数量很少，这通常是不够的。我认为除此之外，你必须正确把握时机，知道这些赢家输家动态何时会真正发挥作用。通常，如果它通过某种**明确的价格竞争压力**、**明确的份额竞争压力**导致这些定价压力，然后再加上其他因素，例如管理层的**执行失误**，那么你就有了一个相当不错的做空机会。但问题是，这些因素在你需要的时间框架内同时发生，这是一个棘手的问题。然后再加上所有那些**因素轮动**以及当今市场**被动**的性质，这些市场通常由**量化基金**、**ETF**和其他基金驱动。你还有其他驱动交易的动态需要考虑。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: It's a it's a great question because it's really the opposite muscle of the long side as you know it's really thinking about uh so sometimes you will see clear the shorts that are the broken mirror images of the longs x is winning y is losing um I find those are very rare uh and few and far between and that's not enough usually I think in addition to that you have to have the timing correct as to when exactly those uh winner loser dynamics will play out usually uh if it plays out through um some combination of uh clear price competitive pressures, clear share competitive pressures leading to those pricing pressures um and then that combined with you know other factors such as just misexecution by management uh you have a pretty good pretty good short. The problem though is that combination of factors occurring within the time frame you need uh is a tricky one. Uh and then add to that all of the sort of um factor rotations and the passive uh nature of the markets today often driven by quant and ETF and other funds. You have other dynamics that are driving trading you need to think about.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangian**: 你做空吗？

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我的意思是，因为你在很长一段时间内都是错的，而当你对了的时候，它就像一阵爆发，你知道，而且持续时间不长。你可能在一周内非常正确，然后又在两年内错了，对吧？日复一日地坚持很难。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: I mean it's because you are you are wrong for such a long period of time and when you're right it's just like in these bursts, you know, and they don't last very long. You may be like super right for one week and then you're kind of wrong again for two years, right? It's hard taking day in day out.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我们仍然追求绝对利润，美元做空。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: We still look for absolute profit, dollar shorts.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangian**: 你关心**估值**吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: Do you care about valuations?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我关心。我认为估值非常重要。我们关注**自由现金流倍数**。我们支出**股权激励**。我们做所有不时髦的事情，并以相当保守的方式看待事物。这样做的原因是我之前提到的，希望管理**风险**。所以，我认为思考**风险调整后回报**，我认为估值以及你预先支付的价格是其中非常重要的一部分，特别是考虑到估值和市场中的**信息不对称**，这一点更为重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: I do. I think valuation matters a lot. Uh we look at free cash flow multiples. Uh we expend stockbased comp. We do all the unfashionable things and look at things pretty conservatively. Uh and the reason for that is what I said earlier about wanting to manage risk. So thinking I think about riskadjusted returns and I think valuation and what you pay upfront is very much a part of that and particularly uh thinking about valuation and the information asymmetries in the market even more so.

### 在Lone Pine Capital学到的教训

**Nicolola Tangian**: 让我们回到你在**Lone Pine Capital**的时光，你和**Steve Mandel**一起创立了它。你在Lone Pine Capital学到的最重要的教训是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: Let's go back to your time at uh Lumpine uh and you you know you set it up with Steve Mandal. Um what did you what was the most important learnings from your time at Lomine?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 是的。嗯，我认为有几点。我的意思是，我认为我很幸运能与那里一群杰出的人合作，包括Steve。我想说，我提炼出的一个重要教训正是我们讨论过的**偏见**。让我给你一个非常具体的例子。我给你几个例子。你谈到了做空。我们可以从做空开始。我在Lone Pine Capital犯的最大错误之一是做空**诺基亚**（Nokia）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Yeah. Um I think uh there were several I mean I think uh and I was really lucky to work with the the brilliant group of people there including Steve. Um I would say one of the big lessons I distilled was really what we discussed around biases. Let me give you a very specific example. I'll give you a couple of examples. Um and you talked about shorts. We can start with shorts. One of one of my biggest mistakes at Lomine was shorting Nokia

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我做空了诺基亚，因为它最终下跌了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: and I shorted Nokia for went down at the end.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 这就是有趣的地方。所以，你知道，我当时认为自己绝对正确。然后显然在2014年，**微软**（Microsoft）以70亿美元的价格收购了它。那对我来说，对我的公司来说，都是非常痛苦的一天。然后18个月后，微软将其减记。它消失了。所以，你可能是对的，也可能完全彻底地错了，回到你之前关于做空的问题。那么，教训是什么？教训是，如果你把这家企业看作一家**独立企业**，是的，你是对的。太棒了。然而，你并没有真正思考这家企业在更广阔时间范围内的所有其他**战略价值**。所以，思考企业不是孤立的，而是更**系统性**的，但不是**孤立思维**，这是我必须反复学习并教导我的团队的事情。所以，系统性而非孤立思维，这是第一点。诺基亚的例子就是其中之一。

另一个是避免**资产负债表杠杆**，比如**公开杠杆收购**（public LBOs），我通过艰难的方式学到，那可能不适合我。我犯过错误，投资了一些不错的企业，但它们过度杠杆化了。结果，当不可避免的宏观紧张局势出现时，它们的**周转能力**大大降低。所以这是另一个重要的教训，我在这方面犯过错误。例如像**Altice**这样的企业。

第三个，我认为也许是最有趣的一个，回到关于**AI芯片堆栈**的讨论，以及旧技术如何以新方式进行颠覆，那就是**英伟达**（Nvidia）。所以英伟达，我当时把它看作一家**GPU业务**。但后来在2015年，**DeepMind论文**发表了，关于**深度强化学习**，这非常有趣和令人兴奋，你开始看到**并行计算**将是多么必要，GPU将如何有助于这种并行计算的运作，以驱动这种有趣的新**机器学习引擎**。当时不知道**生成式AI**会发生什么，但你肯定看到了机器学习的进展以及后来成为生成式AI的早期阶段。

而且，当时除了用于**视频游戏**的GPU之外，还有一个很大的**加密货币**成分。所以，当时驱动英伟达的是**游戏**和加密货币。我说，好吧，是的，但会有这个AI的东西，那会很大。结果他们错过了很多，你知道，因为加密货币的集中崩溃，以及**中国**游戏许可的延迟，这些都驱动了视频游戏业务的很大一部分需求。所以，我卖掉了，我不应该卖掉，但更大的错误不是那个，更大的错误是后来没有重新审视英伟达。所以，我发现**沉没成本偏误**是一个非常强大的偏误，这就是为什么我现在在SurgoCap投入这么多时间，确保我们对现有想法集保持强有力的审视，并确保我们不断修正，包括我们错过的那些名字。所以，**遗漏领域**也要确保我们不会反复遇到这个问题。

Um and you talked about shorts. We can start with shorts. One of one of my biggest mistakes at Lomine was shorting Nokia and I shorted Nokia for went down at the end. So this is what's interesting. So, you know, thought I was absolutely right. And then obviously 2014, Microsoft comes out and buys the thing for $7 billion. And it was a very painful day for me and for and for my firm. Um, and then 18 months later, Microsoft writes it off. It's gone. And so, you can be right and you can be completely and utterly wrong to your earlier point of the short side. So, what was the lesson? The lesson is um if you think about the business as a standalone business, yes, you were right. Great. However, you didn't really think about all of the other, you know, strategic value of the business broadly over time. So, thinking about a business not in isolation, but thinking more systemically, but not in silos is something I have to learn over and over again and something I teach my team. So, systemic not silo thinking, that's number one. And the Noki example is one. The other is avoiding um balance sheet leverage like uh public LBOS's I've learned the hard way are probably not my thing. I've made mistakes where I have invested in decent businesses that were over pretty decent business that were overlevered. Uh but as a result they had much less maneuvering cap capacity when times of inevitable macro tensions arose. So that's another big big lesson and I made mistakes there. um businesses like Altis for example. Um the third is I think maybe the most interesting one going back to discussions of the AI chip stack uh and of how old technologies can disrupt in new ways which is uh Nvidia. So Nvidia um saw it very much as a GPU business what it was. But then 2015 we had the uh deep reinforcement learn the deep mind papers come out and it was incredibly interesting and exciting and you began to see how parallel compute would be necessary how GPUs would be helpful for that par essential for that parallel compute to work to drive this interesting new engine of machine learning. didn't know what generative AI was going to happen, but you definitely saw what was happening with machine learning and early stages of what would then become, you know, gener generative AI. Um, and the fact that was back then apart from just uh GPUs for video games, there was a big crypto component as well. So, it was gaming and crypto that was driving Nvidia at the time. And I said, well, yeah, but there was going to be this AI thing and that's going to be big. uh turns out they missed ma you know significantly because of a you know concentrate crash in crypto and and uh game uh permitting delays in China which were driving a big portion of demand for the video gaming part of the business. Um so I sold which I shouldn't have but here's the bigger that was a mistake but the bigger mistake was not that the bigger mistake was then not revisiting Nvidia later. So this some cost bias I find is a very powerful one and that's why I spend so much time now at SIGRO to make sure that we keep a strong kind of survey of the available idea sets out there and make sure we continually revise including the names that we missed. So areas of emission as well to make sure we don't bump into this issue repeatedly.

**Nicolola Tangian**: 重新买回你低价卖出的东西真的很难。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: It's so difficult to buy back things you sold lower on. Yeah, but that's in my opinion that's not an excuse.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 是的，但在我看来，那不是借口。我认为正是因为这很难，所以它是一个真正重要且有趣的新想法机会。当你犯错时，这经常发生。至少对我来说是这样。所以我认为这些可能是三个具体的教训。一个围绕**系统性而非孤立思维**，另一个围绕对**金融杠杆**的警惕，而不是我们都乐于接受的其他杠杆驱动因素，第三个则是关于我们之前谈到的这些**偏见**，包括**沉没成本偏误**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: And I think I think precisely because that is so hard it's a really important and interesting opportunity set for new ideas uh when when you are wrong which happens a lot. Um and so at least to me so I think that's some those are those are probably three concrete examples of clear lessons. one around systemic not siloed thinking, the other around weariness around financial leverage versus the other drivers of leverage that we all are happy about and the third being around these biases uh that we talked about earlier including the sun cause bias.

### 成长背景与价值观

**Nicolola Tangian**: 嗯，我很想问你几个稍微个人化的问题。你认为，你在美国和**印度**两地长大的**多元文化背景**，是否影响了你对世界和投资的看法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: Uh well, I'd love to ask you um a couple of questions just on um slightly more personal nature. Do you think uh I mean you grew up partly in the US, partly in India. Um do you think that m multicultural background is impacting the way you view the world and investments?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 非常大。我想说，在印度长大，在当时的**班加罗尔**长大，那不是今天的班加罗尔。那是一个非常宁静的小镇。当时它实际上被认为是一个退休小镇。我的父母都是，我母亲是医生，我父亲是学者。他们当时在那里以这种身份工作。那是一种非常安静、非常学术、在许多方面都非常理智的成长环境。但它并非没有接触到当时印度非常严峻的现实。当时的印度在许多方面都饱受“围墙”之苦。那时它是一个封闭的经济体，被称为“**许可证制度**”（license raj）。而且非常明显，即使作为一个小女孩，我也能看到这给整体经济带来了真正的问题。

但我认为，同时看到**收入不平等**的程度，这不仅在印度，而且在全世界都令人震惊，其危险性对我来说变得非常清楚，以及由此导致的**对机构的信任丧失**，由此经常导致的**腐败**，这些都是我从小就经历和周围充斥着的事物。我认为这至少在我心中激发出一种强烈的**回馈社会**和**服务社会**的需要。我认为这部分也源于我的家庭。我的曾祖母曾因在**甘地独立运动**中的工作而入狱。我认为这种**社会服务**的理念以及如何回馈社会，在印度成长的社会现实中得到了进一步的强化。

话虽如此，在某些方面它也是美好的，部分原因也正是因为那些障碍。一种非常强大的本土文化和本土活力，以及非常丰富的文学和历史感和自我意识，这些也来自于印度当时相对封闭的事实。所以，我认为由于所有这些，我也带着对印度所代表的以及它今天所成为的，以及未来将成为的，一种强烈的**自豪感**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Very much so. Uh I would say uh growing up in India, growing up in a Bangalore that was not the Bangalore it is today. A very sleepy town. It was actually considered a retirement town at that point. My parents are both um my mother's a doctor, my father's an academic. Uh and they you know worked uh there in in the in that capacity. uh and it was a very quiet, very academic uh very cerebral up upbringing in many ways. But it was not without exposure to the very uh stark realities of India at the time. Uh an India that was uh suffering in many ways from the u from the walls that were put up. It was it was a closed off economy at the time, the license raj as it was called. Uh and it was very apparent that that was leading to real you know issues for the for the economy overall even as a young girl growing up. But I think also seeing the level of income inequality something that is striking not just India but the world at large and the perils of that became very clear to me and the resulting loss in trust in institutions the resulting corruption that that often results in uh was something I grew up with and was I just was all around me and I think it's something that led in me at least to a very fierce sense of a need to give back and be of service. uh and I think that's partly also my my family. Um my great-grandmother was in jail working because of her work uh with the independence movement under Gandhi. Uh and I think that idea of social service and how you give back was very much that became all the more reinforced by the social realities of growing up in India. Now all of that said it was also wonderful in some ways partly also because of the barrier. a very strong local culture and local dynamic and a very rich um literature and uh sense of history and self that came about uh as well from some of the the fact that you know India was more more closed off at that point in time and so I think as a result of all of that I also came away with this sense of great pride in in in what India stands for and what it has become today and what will become in the future.

**Nicolola Tangian**: 你是许多女性的榜样。我认为当你推出你的基金时，那是任何女性有史以来最大的对冲基金发行，对吧？这非常了不起。对于作为投资界的女性，你有什么感想？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: you are a role model for many women and um and I think when you when you launched your fund it was the biggest launch biggest hedge fund launch of any woman ever right that's is pretty pretty amazing any reflections around being a woman in the investment world

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我想说，首先，我希望这个记录能很快被打破，而且我相信会的。外面有很多非常棒、有才华的女性。嗯，我希望我不仅是女性的榜样，也是更广泛的投资界，并希望随着时间的推移，也能成为**慈善界**的榜样。这是我工作、精神和身份中非常重要的一部分。我想说，嗯，我有点，我真的认为广义上的投资业务，无论你以何种方式成为**局外人**，都是一项伟大的事业。它是我能想到的最**精英主义**的业务。我的意思是，我可能是一个长着两只角的绿色火星人，但如果我能带来投资回报，就会有人排队等着获取我的产品，对吧？所以我认为这是一个非常精英主义的行业，我只希望像SurgoCap这样的地方，像你在这里运营的平台，能让更多的人在这个行业中创造价值，因为我真的认为对于所有类型、形状和规模的**求知欲强**的人来说，这是一个很棒的行业，可以进来并为整个世界做出贡献。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: I would say look I first of all I hope that's a record that's broken very quickly uh and I and I'm sure it will be uh there's some really amazing talented women out there um look I hope I'm not just a role model for women but you know the broader investment community and hopefully over time the philanthropic community as well. That's a very important part of my my my work and my ethos and my identity. Um I would say um I'm a little I really think the investment business broadly uh whether you're uh whether whether you're an outsider in any way, shape, or form um is a great one. It's about as meritocratic a business as I can think of. I mean, I could be a green Martian with two horns in my head, but if I produce investment returns, there'll be a line out the door uh you know, wanting to get my my product, right? So I think it's a very meritocratic industry and I just hope that places like Serggo, places like uh you know the platform you're running here are just ways for more people to add value in this industry because I really think it's a it's a terrific one for people who are intellectually curious of all stripes and shapes and sizes to come in and and and be of be of use to the world at large.

### 慈善与创意工作

**Nicolola Tangian**: 嗯，你确实有很多方面，因为你对这么多不同的事情感兴趣。你写过一本书，参与过一部剧。嗯，所有这些是如何融入你的**创造力**和**好奇心**的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: Well, you have indeed many stripes because you are interested in so many different things. you I mean you've written you've written a book, you've been involved with a play. Um how does uh all this um play into your kind of creativity and curiosity?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我认为……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: I think uh

</details>

**Nicolola Tangian**: 但你先告诉我你做的一些事情，因为你做了很多有趣的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: but tell me about some of the stuff you do first because you do a lot of funky stuff.

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 除了我的专业工作，我主要做两件事。一是**慈善事业**，我们可以谈谈。你问到了**创意作品**。我可以先谈谈那个。嗯，嗯，我们先谈谈慈善事业。所以在慈善方面，我开始得很早。从在**Lone Pine Capital**的第一年起，我就觉得回馈社会非常重要。就像我作为投资者一样，这实际上是关于支持真正优秀的**社会企业家**，并确保我们能够发现他们，并及早发现他们。我很幸运地遇到了**Paul Farmer**，他当时很早就开始建立**Partners In Health**。他不幸去世了，但他是我的一位伟大导师。他总是说，公共卫生更像是武装抢劫，而不是帮助老太太过马路。你必须打破一些东西才能建立一些东西。这确实是这样，而且在打破**孤立思维**方面还有很多工作要做，才能真正将解决方案带给人们，例如在印度的一个农村妇产诊所。我通过像他这样的人，通过像**Atul Gawande**这样的人以及我合作过的其他人学到了这一点。所有这些都促成了我与当时在**盖茨基金会**工作的**Sema Sgaier**共同创立了**Surgo Health**。这已经追溯到十多年前了，我们的观点是如何利用数据来真正帮助医疗保健服务交付，这些数据不仅是数据本身，更是**行为数据**。所以我认为AI领域最有趣的事情之一，可能就是为AI添加“为什么”。AI非常擅长解决“是什么”的问题。Nikolai接下来会点击哪个广告？但不是“为什么”。我认为添加这种大规模的**行为数据**，你可以通过一些非常基本的贝叶斯网络数学来做到，以说明为什么一个女人不去妇产诊所分娩。为什么XYZ社区不使用避孕措施。这是我们投入大量时间研究的问题，而**数据作为公共产品**和**数据科学作为公共产品**是我们投入大量时间研究的。所以这是慈善工作的重要组成部分，我们与**比尔及梅琳达·盖茨基金会**等组织以及地方政府合作提供帮助。

举个例子，一个有趣的项目是**孕产妇死亡率**的工作，我们在印度做了很多这方面的工作，以帮助**北方邦**（Uttar Pradesh）每年花费10亿美元用于妇产诊所的普及和推广。然后我们接到美国打来的电话，说美国的孕产妇死亡率正在上升，这是一个真正的问题，我们如何在美国使用同样的技术？然后这促成了一个与**优步**（Uber）合作的项目，你知道，与**DARPA**合作，我联系了你在这里采访过的人，为妈妈们提供**乘车服务**。所以问题不在于你。问题在于有一个生育计划，并确保女性真正去诊所，在这种情况下，**交通**实际上是一个有趣的问题。那是交通问题，而不是医院护理问题。所以理解“为什么”非常重要。所以我就说到这里，但我认为这是一个非常重要的方面，技术方面和慈善方面在这里非常有趣地重叠。

在创意工作方面，我认为我们作为人最快乐的时候，不是当我们沉迷于自己时，而是当我们忘记自己时，无论是我们的专业工作、慈善工作还是创意工作。所以我非常享受地做这些，从大学时代就开始了。那就是写短篇小说。我认为归根结底，一切都是一个**叙事**，对吧？我们最近和一群非常多元化的成功人士共进晚餐。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Uh I do two main things apart from my professional works. One is the philanthropy uh which we can talk about and you asked about the creative works. I can talk about that first. Um the the well let's talk about the philanthropy. So on the philan phil philanthropic front um I started very early. So from year one at Lomi I felt it was very important to start giving back. Uh and just as I do as investor it was really about backing really great social entrepreneurs and making sure we could see them and see them early. Um so I was very lucky to meet uh Paul Farmer who was early in building partners in health at the time. Um uh he sadly passed away uh but was a great mentor to me. uh and uh he said he always said you know public health is more like you know armed robbery than it is you know helping the old lady cross the road. You have to break things to build things. And it it truly is and and there's a lot that needs to be done in terms of breaking siloed thinking to really get solutions to people uh in a rural maternity clinic in India for example um that I learned through people like him through people like Otul Gowande uh and others that I've worked with and that all led to uh uh Sema Guyire who was uh working at Gates Foundation at the time and I to set up Sergo Health uh and this this really going back now over a decade and our view was very much how do we take healthcare service delivery and really help with data sets that are targeted not just data and the set of data but behavioral data. So I think one of the most interesting things happening potentially in AI is adding the why to AI. Not I AI is very good at solving what questions. What ad will Nikolai click on next but not why. And I think adding um this large scale behavioral data uh which you can do with you know sort of some pretty basic basian uh networking math to say this is why a woman is not going to the maternity clinic to to deliver. this is why uh XYZ is not using contraception in this community is something that we've been spending a lot of time on and and data as a public good and data science as a public good is something we we we spend a lot of time on. So that's that's a big part of the philanthropic effort and we work with groups like the Beninda Gates Foundation and others as well as local governments to help. So for example and one thing that's was interesting is the maternal mortality work where we did a lot of this work in India to help target the state of Uttar Pradesh spending a billion bucks a year on just maternity clinic adoption and driving that up and then we're getting calls from people in the US saying maternal mortality is rising here it's a real problem how can we use those same techniques here in the US and then that then led to a really program with Uber you know with DAR actually I reached out to I think you've interviewed here um to do rides for moms so the problem was not you The problem was having a maternity plan and making sure women actually went to the clinic in which case transportation was actually an interesting thing. It was transport not hospital care. So understanding the why is really important. So that I'll wrap up there but I think that's a really important side where both the technology side and the philanthropic side overlap really interestingly on the creative work. Um look I think we're happiest as people when not when we're you know obsessing over ourselves but when we forget ourselves whether it's our professional work or philanthropic work or creative work. And so I very much do it out of joy have since college. um writing short stories that is and um I think at the end of the day everything is a narrative right and we had dinner recently with a group of very diverse range of very successful people and

</details>

**Nicolola Tangian**: 嗯，你，你预测。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: well you you predictions

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 你，你做有趣的晚餐。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: you do you do fun dinners

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我们请他们做预测，他们都提出了相当悲观的预测。所以，**叙事自我**与我如何看待自己，以及**社会自我**、**社会背景**之间存在这种冲突。所以我认为这种冲突是我喜欢写作和思考的，而且这真的很有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: and we asked them to do predictions they all came up with pretty pessimistic ones so there's this conflict between the narrative self and what I see how I see myself uh versus the social self social context and so I think that conflict is something I I like to to write about and think about and It's it's been really fun.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangian**: 那么，你的**剧场项目**呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: What about the theater project?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 是的，所以剧场项目，**心灵剧场**（Theater of the Mind），它实际上是基于一系列**神经科学实验**。我当时对一些**经济学游戏**中发生的事情非常感兴趣。我们谈到了**Kahneman**、**Tversky**和**Ferriski**的工作。例如，有一个叫做**独裁者游戏**（dictator's game），即使一个小组中的个体玩家可以拿走桌上所有的硬币，他们也不会这样做。他们想要分享。所以这是充满希望的。我对这个很感兴趣，我想把它带到伦敦科学博物馆的地下室，那是世界上最伟大的博物馆之一。我的朋友**Brian Eno**说：“不，不，不。这还有更多。”他把我介绍给了**David Byrne**，他当时正在思考一个在非常不同背景下的实验，那是一个更具感官性的实验，玩弄**本体感受**，以及你如何能够“居住”在一个玩偶的身体里，这实际上是瑞典的一个实验室，叫做**Erson Labs**，他们做了这项工作。当我们见面时，我们认为，好吧，这实际上是完全不同的东西，这是一个**戏剧作品**。它有一个叙事。这是一个男人倒着过一生的故事，处理记忆，并融入了这些实验性元素。它在丹佛非常成功地上演，现在正移师芝加哥的**古德曼剧院**（Goodman Theater）。所以这也真的很有趣。所以它只是，你知道，它真的是关于以新颖和新鲜的方式思考，并确保这能融入更具创造性、更少**孤立思维**的思考方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Yeah, so the theater project, the theater of the mind, uh it's a uh it was based actually in a series of uh neuroscience experiments. I uh had was very interested in what was happening around some of these economic games. We talked about Kaman Thaylor and Ferriski's work. Uh there's one called the dictators game for example where even though uh an individual in a group playing this game could take all of the coins on the table, they do not. They want to share. So that's hopeful. Uh, and I was interested in that and I wanted to take that to the basement of the science museum in London, one of the great museums of the world. And my friend Brian Eno said, "No, no, no. There's something more to this introduced me to to David Burn who was thinking about an experiment in a very different context. Uh, which was more sensory playing with propriception and how you can inhabit the body of a doll is actually a Swedish lab called Erson Labs that did this work. Uh, and when we met, we thought, okay, this is actually something else completely different, which is a theater piece. It has a narrative. It's a story of a life of a man living his life backwards, dealing with memories with these experimental aspects woven in. Uh it played very successfully in Denver and it's now moving to the Goodman Theater in Chicago. So that's been really fun as well. So it just it's it's you know it's really about thinking in new and fresh ways and making sure that that feeds into a more creative uh less less siloed thinking.

### 将跨领域经验融入投资

**Nicolola Tangian**: 你如何将所有这些带回投资中？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: How do you bring all this back into investing?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我认为所有这些都回到了这样一个想法：一切在某种程度上都是一个**叙事**，并且真正思考**背景**以及它有多么强大，而不是剧中的个体角色，以及它们如何共同作用，真正思考一个**系统性整体**。我认为这是所有这些的共同点。另一个是**好奇心**。我认为好奇心对于我们所做的几乎所有事情都是关键，无论是在慈善方面解决问题，还是找到一个伟大的投资并尽可能地理解它，或者创作一个好的创意作品。我认为另一个是**开放性**。所以，我认为写作是一个很好的**谦逊**练习。与我工作的其他两个领域不同，没有人真正关心我是否再写一个短篇故事。世界上有很多这样的故事。但要真正确保人们关心，你必须不断修改和修改，而修改是为了使其尽可能好。而修改就是对可能性和更好的事物的**开放性**。我认为要警惕**确定性**。我认为这可能是所有这些的另一个共同点。那个100%确定X或Y正在发生的人，总是会让我亮起红旗。事情从来没有那么确定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: I think all of this goes back to this idea of how everything is a narrative in some ways and really thinking about um the context and how powerful that is versus the individual characters of the play and how they all work together to really thinking about a systemic whole. I think that is the common point across each of these. Uh the other is curiosity. I think curiosity is key to pretty much everything we do in each of these, whether it's solving a problem philanthropically, finding a great investment and understanding it as well as you can. Um, or producing a good a good piece of creative work. I think the other is openness. Um, so I think with the writing it's a great exercise in humility. Unlike the other two spheres of my work, no one really cares if I write another short story or not. The world is plenty of those. But to really make sure that that people do care, you have to keep revising and revising and what is revision to make it as good as possible. And what is revision is just openness to possibility and openness to something better. And I think be aware of certainty. I think that's probably another commonality across all of these. Uh the the the the person who's 100% sure that X or Y is happening is something that always raises a red flag with me. It never is that certain.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangian**: 保持**好奇心**和**谦逊**的关键是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: What's the key to staying curious and humble?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我认为这是一个**良性循环**，对吧？因为如果你一开始就充满好奇和谦逊，你就会学习，你会看到还有多少东西需要学习，这会让你保持谦逊，但你也会对未来的可能性感到兴奋。所以我认为这只是一个非常良性的循环，一开始就进入这个循环，而且我认为，加上更多的乐趣，对吧？有什么比学习更有趣的呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: Uh I think it is very it's a virtuous circle right because if you're curious and humble to begin with uh you learn and you see how much more there is to learn and that keeps you humble and then you but you also are excited by the possibilities out there. So I think it's just very much a virtuous circle of uh getting on that wheel to begin with and I think plus more fun right what's more fun than than learning.

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: Do you structure your thinking or are you just like looking at dogs and trees and

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我不相信。我一天中其他时间有很多**结构化思考**。所以在那一天的那一刻，我只是让我的思绪漫游，看看会想到什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: I don't believe in I have plenty of structured thinking in the rest of my day. So that point of the day I just let my mind roam and uh see see what comes up.

**Nicolola Tangian**: 你如何放松？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangian**: How do you relax?

</details>

**Mala Gaonkar**: 我通过与我爱的人、我的朋友、我的家人共度时光来放松，阅读，你知道，进行长途徒步，你知道，所以，我想我们许多人都有的放松方式，就是与自然接触，与朋友和家人在一起。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mala Gaonkar**: I relax with spending time with the people I love, my friends, my family, uh reading, you know, going for long hikes, you know, so the so the the usual ways of I think many of us have of disconnecting, being with nature and being being with friends and family.

</details>

**Nicolola Tangian**: 太棒了。和你交谈很愉快。你是一个充满好奇心、谦逊、令人难以置信的专业人士。太棒了。
