### 关税裁决引发全球震荡

美国最高法院推翻总统特朗普关税政策的裁决，在全球范围内引发了剧烈的震荡和不确定性。各国政府、国际组织及企业界正争相评估这一重大事件的深远影响。核心问题包括：各国是否会重新审视与美国达成的贸易协议？企业能否获得此前支付的巨额关税退款？以及特朗普总统的贸易政策是否会因此受到实质性限制？《纽约时报》的记者 Tyler Pager（白宫记者）、Anna Swanson（贸易记者）和 Andrew Ross Sorcin（企业界记者）深入分析了这一局面。

<summary>Original English</summary>

From the New York Times, I'm Natalie Kitroof. This is the Daily.

In the wake of the monumental Supreme Court ruling striking down President Trump's tariffs, the entire world is scrambling to understand what comes next. Will countries back away from the massive deals they made with Trump? Will companies get refunds for the billions they already spent on tariffs? And will Trump actually be constrained by any of this? Today, my colleagues Tyler Pager, Anna Swanson, and Andrew Ross Sorcin explain.

It's Monday, February 23rd.

Tyler, you cover the White House. Andrew, you cover corporate America. Anna, you cover trade. Thank you all for joining me on this Sunday afternoon.

>> Thanks so much, Natalie.
>> Thanks for having us.
>> Yeah, glad to be here. So to catch us up from where we left things on Friday with the massive news that the Supreme Court had invalidated most of the administration's tariffs, we saw Trump respond first by putting in place a new 10% tariff on imports across the board and then jacking it up to 15% over the weekend. We're going to get into the specifics of that today. But just to start, what have the reactions been in the worlds that you all cover? Tyler, I want to start with you. take us inside the reaction from the White House.

>> On Friday morning, the president was speaking to a group of governors in the East Room of the White House when Jameson Greer, the trade representative, handed him a note, alerting him to the Supreme Court's decision. The president told the governors it was a disgrace. He lashed out at the Supreme Court and quickly wrapped up that meeting and left. And he was irate. He met with adviserss. And then we saw that full-blown anger on display in the White House briefing room a few hours later.

And for Trump, this wasn't just a political loss, but a personal one, too. He has been obsessed with tariffs as an economic tool for decades, long before his political career. And so this felt like a real personal loss to something he deeply believes in.

>> And Anna, how has the international community responded?

So obviously this had been somewhat expected for other countries that were following the Supreme Court ruling, but it has still caused a lot of immediate doubt and confusion with countries that have been agonizing about these tariffs all year. So you had countries that had just finalized their trade deal the day before. Now the underlying terms of trade, the tariffs that those deals are based on are gone and replaced with something entirely different. And some of those countries have made concessions that are controversial with their own people. So this has just introduced a lot of uncertainty for the months to come.

>> And Andrew, what about the corporate world?

The Trump administration's tariff effort is probably the most significant shift in global trade in decades and really is the most important sort of rethink about how the United States trades with other countries, how US corporations operate in other countries, how international companies operate in our countries. I mean it is everything. I spent the weekend talking to business leaders and CEOs, many of whom really have rescrambled their entire supply chains over the last six months. Made commitments to bring manufacturing back to the United States, switched manufacturing plants from places like China to India to other places, thought that they had remapped what their true costs were going to be, and are now looking at this saying, "Oh my goodness, what comes next?" Hm.

>> I think all of these companies are spending the weekend trying to think through all of this with a sense though that this is going to be a very long-term fight, whatever it is.

>> Okay. So, there's a lot of confusion with companies and countries trying to sort out what all this uncertainty means for them. Tyler, the administration has obviously been preparing for this moment for a while. It's been clear that the Supreme Court was skeptical of these tariffs long before the actual ruling, but the response from the White House has still seemed pretty chaotic. First the 10%, then the 15%. Do we have any idea what's behind that sense of chaos?

>> Yeah, it was quite a whiplash over just less than 24 hours where the president came out to the briefing room and announced these 10% tariffs. Later that evening, Friday, he signed the official paperwork instituting those 10% tariffs. And then Saturday morning, he announces this 15% tariff on social media. And what I will tell you, Natalie, is that many of the president's adviserss and people close to the White House were surprised and taken aback by the rapid change from 10 to 15%. Some have speculated that the president was frustrated by the media coverage of his loss at the Supreme Court and wanted to show that he still had power to raise tariffs even more. But we have not heard from the president since then about precisely why he made this change less than 24 hours later.

>> I do think there's um an important point there just to jump in. So, you know, some people had speculated earlier that maybe they would save that extra 5% increase and use it as leverage or negotiation later, but at 15% the rate does get you close to what it was overall before. So, at 10% it was a little bit lower than the the rate had been previously. Now, it's like pretty close. So, within an average percentage point of what it was before. Of course, this one is flat whereas the previous rate varied a lot by country. So there are huge differences for different countries.

>> Right. Right. And just to jump off that, I want to understand Anna what you've been reporting on which is the options that the administration is pursuing now outside of just the 15% tariff. Can you ground us here? Give us a kind of sober explanation of what the administration has in store for us.

Yeah, absolutely. So, there was always a plan B because before plan A, the president was presented with this menu of options for his tariffs and he had chosen this International Emergency Economics Powers Act because it was the most flexible. It allowed him to raise and lower tariffs at a whim. But he always had a lot of other options and in fact um you know some of his adviserss preferred those other options because they were less vulnerable to a court challenge. So now he's kind of going back to th that original playbook, right? And so there are a few different authorities. One important one is called section 301. It's run by the office of the United States trade representative. They'll carry out investigations into unfair trade practices and can levy tariffs that way. It's what the president used against China in his first term. He also has another called section 232 which allows for tariffs on the basis of national security and there are a lot of tariffs that have been levied that way as well. So the administration has put in place this 15% tariff for now. That's a flat rate for the world. Those tariffs expire in 5 months and if Trump wants to extend them, he needs the approval of Congress, which seems pretty unlikely at this point given that midterms are coming up and voters are concerned about affordability and tariffs adding to costs. And just to say the midterms and the fact that the tariffs largely aren't actually popular with voters, that's actually part of the calculus for the business community as they consider their plans because they're looking at all these tariffs and they're wondering given the politics of this moment, are these tariffs still going to be here in 6 months? Because in truth, the view is that if these tariffs are not going to exist come this fall, the whole game gets rescrambled. It changes completely all over again.

And so it's going to be very interesting to see whether companies tip their hand and really tell us what they're going to do, whether they're going to be willing to really talk about what their plans are next as they're making them.

>> And Andrew makes a great point because this is of utmost importance to the president himself. I was just with the president in Georgia on Thursday where he was touting these various business executives who told him that they were moving manufacturing or expanding manufacturing in the United States because of his tariffs. This is of personal pride to the president. If companies are changing their plans or making new plans, they run the risk of some sort of retribution campaign from the president who feels extremely proud of the impact he believes tariffs are having in reshaping the American economy and reviving the manufacturing sector.

Okay, Andrew, I want to talk about what the future may hold for these companies, but I have to ask. It seems as though the corporate world that you cover has been really focused on the question of what this decision means about the tariffs they've already paid, about the past, whether and how they might get refunds on the billions in costs they've already racked up. What do we know about that? So look, you you can look at companies like Toyota, which recently attributed about $8 billion of losses to the tariffs. Ford said that the tariff related charges cost them $2 billion in 2025. They're expecting over a billion dollars in 2026. Uh General Motors uh is in somewhat of a similar camp. So there are a lot of businesses that have been impacted uh by this that they can look directly at those losses and say they want that money back. There's a real question about whether they can get that money back, how the refund process works, when you actually have to sue effectively or put in for the refund, you might need to do it relatively quickly, which also means you have to do it publicly. Mhm.

>> Again, this question of when you publicly seek a refund, what does that ultimately also mean for your business if it's regulated in some other way by the US government and if you're concerned at all about the administration somehow coming back at you in another way,

>> retaliating? You're you're saying basically there may be some risk for these businesses in confronting the president on this. You know, this administration has aggressively pursued companies in so many different ways, whether it be law firms or you can look at some of the big media companies or so many other instances where they have used their regulatory powers against corporations that they did not believe were quote unquote on side, if you will, with this administration. And therefore, I think there's a big question about, you know, whether some of these companies will seek refunds or not.

Anna, you regularly talk to small businesses who have been affected by the tariffs. I wonder whether they are at a disadvantage in terms of getting refunds given everything that's involved. What are you hearing?

>> Yeah, absolutely. So, small businesses tend to have fewer resources. They can't hire the high price lawyers, the lobbyists to come in and talk to the Trump administration. And that has really made a difference in how different industries and companies have been treated over the past year. And I think, you know, one thing is that this tariff system has just added this huge amount of complexity for businesses to deal with. And that takes resources. I hear from companies all the time that instead of doing, you know, their business, they're spending time figuring out these tariffs. And so that's a big cost for companies. It's hard to describe just how complicated the Trump's tariff system was before the Supreme Court ruling. There were different rates for different countries, different products. Now that is all gone. It's replaced with an entirely very different set system of tariffs. There's a 150day clock running on that with big questions about what is going to replace it.

>> And all that uncertainty is just it's bad for investment. I mean, companies are not going to want to invest billions of dollars in a factory that will take years to build if tariff policy is going to change dramatically in the next few months.

>> Okay, we're going to get to those bigger implications. Andrew, I have what may seem like a technical question for you. We talked on the show before about the question surrounding who was actually paying for the tariffs. Were the companies eating the cost or were they passing it on to consumers? If the companies raised prices because of tariffs, can they actually legitimately get refunds?

>> You are asking what may be the $175 billion question, which is to say there is an argument that may be made by this administration in court if a company comes to seek a refund. It is possible that the administration will argue that they effectively raised prices, didn't suffer or subject themselves therefore to a loss, and therefore effectively have no standing to collect a refund.

>> And Tyler, how is the administration thinking about this question of companies potentially demanding massive refunds?

>> Natalie, they're not really seeming to think about it all that much at all. We saw Treasury Secretary Scott Pess say he didn't think that the American people would see this money and the president at his news conference on Friday basically ignored questions about refunds. And so even as reporters repeatedly tried to press him, he has very much quickly moved on and has started talking about new tariffs that he wants to institute. and there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of consideration about what this process may look like should companies start requesting them.

>> Yeah, I think it's pretty clear that they're not going to be very enthusiastic about paying that money back. The question is how, you know, cooperative they are with any eventual court order. um it will really be up to the administration to set up this system for refunds and that could be you know it could be an easy process if they wanted to make it that way or it could be kind of a nightmare for companies. You know honestly I I wouldn't be surprised if it's months or even years by the time this process plays out in court by the time this system is set up and companies actually get that money in their hands. Can I say part of the political decision by this administration to pursue tariffs the way he did was because of the expectation that even if they were overturned, it would be very difficult to get the refunds back.

>> H you're saying it was part of the design?

>> All of this was part of the design because by default it forced these companies and these countries into this particular situation. some of whom have made commitments, not just commitments, but have made investments that are very hard to turn back on now.

>> Yeah. So, essentially, you could see these tariffs as a year of a kind of corporate tax. Is that fair?

>> Some people would call them a corporate tax. Some people would call them a tax on consumers. The administration would call them a tax on other countries.

>> After the break, we look at those other countries and the global fallout from the tariff ruling. We'll be right back.
So Anna, I want to talk about all the agreements that Trump has reached, all the deals he's reached with other countries, trade deals that everyone from Europe to Japan has made based on what have now been deemed illegal tariffs. Are those deals now moot?

Well, it's still kind of up in the air. So, countries have agreed to major concessions over the last few months. The administration has made initial trade deals that in a lot of cases are kind of vague, but you know, still deals with dozens of countries in which they've agreed to drop tariffs, make big investments in the United States. And now the tariffs that underly those are suddenly gone. But you already see some hesitation on the part of other countries, you know, that have agreed to these terms. So you had officials in the EU saying recently that they might pause the ratification of their trade deal. And the other piece of this is that this new system, this flat 15% tariff for everybody for some countries feels really, really unfair because they have made a lot of concessions to the United States in order to lower their tariff rates. Now they're right back where everybody else is. So countries like Britain and Australia were at 10%. Now they're at 15% along with other countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, India. So a lot of people in other countries just questioning whether they should have made all these concessions to the president for tariffs that are not now in effect. But Anna, do these countries not have the same risks that we talked about companies having in terms of, you know, poking the bear, potentially confronting Trump? Couldn't that be dangerous for them if he responds, if he retaliates?

>> Yeah, absolutely. I think they do have a lot of risk when it comes to poking the bear. The president has been restrained by this Supreme Court ruling. He's not able to use that emergency power, but he has a lot of other tariff authorities and he can still, you know, levy just incredible taxes on their imports. So, a lot of countries are not backing away from their deals right away. They're very cognizant that the president has these other tariff powers that he could just whack them with if they do decide to break their agreement. The administration has also warned other countries that they will in fact do that. you know, sometimes it may take writing a report or it may take, you know, a few weeks or months, but he can still, you know, levy just incredible taxes on their imports. That makes a huge difference to industries in other countries that are trying to sell products to the United States. You know, the other piece of this is the biggest country that didn't make a trade deal with the United States, which is China. You know, Trump had threatened something like 125% tariffs on China. He had put very high tariffs on China before they were ruled illegal. And now China has this much lower rate. So I wonder where that leaves us.

>> I think this goes back to the the bigger issue about countries and companies playing chicken with the administration. And you could argue that China has played the best game of chicken yet because they didn't accept some kind of higher rate earlier and they did try to slow roll and play out these negotiations as long as possible. And you heard early on that some countries had thought about approaching it that way. But there became this sort of view especially as a couple of countries early on accepted these deals that this was the future that irrespective of what the Supreme Court said that tariffs in one way or another are here to stay for some period of time that was going to sort of rewrite the global trade order.

>> And Natalie, I think we're going to get a lot more on this front because the president is expected to travel to Beijing.

>> Yep. at the end of March, early April and meet with Xi Jinping. So, we should expect there to be a lot more conversation about what the USChina relationship looks like, particularly as it pertains to trade in the weeks ahead.

>> So, okay, just thinking about where all this leaves Trump on the global stage moving forward, obviously the president now has just lost this major source of power that he's been relying on. What the broad tariff authority had given him was leverage in dealmaking, not just on trade deals, right, but also in his foreign policy generally. He's been achieving what he wants around the world in part by using tariffs as a cudgel to force countries to the table to force him to give him things they want. Now he doesn't have that. What impact does that loss of leverage have? Tyler, let's start with you.

>> Yeah, it's enormous. I mean, it was the centerpiece, arguably of his foreign policy. He used it often for economic reasons, but he also tried to use it to cut peace deals. We know that the president is very determined to win the Nobel Peace Prize. He repeatedly brags about how many conflicts he solved overseas. And at the core of some of those strategies was threatening tariffs on countries if they didn't, in his words, lay down their arms and stop fighting. And so it dramatically changes his negotiating position on the world stage because he's unable to, as Anna very clearly laid out, apply different tariff rates to different countries at a whim. And I think it left a lot of foreign leaders uncertain about what move they made and whether or not they could be punished by the president for whatever they might do. that uncertainty has been diminished in some ways because the president can't just unilaterally apply different tariffs to different countries on any given day.

>> Right? I mean, one one source said to me that this takes away Trump's lightning bolt powers. So, his Zeuslike ability to just, you know,

>> strike other countries with tariffs. It doesn't take away the ability to do tariffs at all. It just requires some planning. So I think you will continue to see the president use the threat of tariffs. It's just you won't see the rate change tomorrow.

>> I think it's also worth pointing out that the president in implementing these new tariffs at 15% across the board is using something called section 122. And it is very possible that the way he's approaching it even this time is going to be brought to court all over again. Neil Katiel, who was the lawyer who brought the original case and went to the Supreme Court and argued it there successfully now, has made this point over the weekend that there's an argument potentially that the president cannot use section 122 in the way that he is attempting to. And so we could be back here 6 months from now again in front of the Supreme Court over this too.

>> That's interesting. You're saying basically that the authorities that the president is now using as an alternative may themselves be challenged. I just want to push though on something which is that we're talking about the president having a weaker hand in negotiations being more constrained and legally that is functionally true. Right? he can no longer just wake up one day and slap 50% tariffs on major trading partners. But I still think though that for a lot of people, it's just hard to believe that that's actually going to happen when you see Trump getting up there at his presser on Friday and essentially saying that's not going to work. I am going to find ways to put tariffs in place and they're going to be even more severe. This is new for President Trump. Congress controlled by Republicans has largely gone along with everything he's wanted to do and the Supreme Court had not limited his power in any major way before this decision. And so for the president, it's a moment where he has to reckon with the checks and balance inherent in the Constitution that for most of his first year in office, he has not really felt constrained by. You're saying this is something we haven't really seen in any major way until this ruling and we don't actually know how Trump is going to respond.

>> Yeah. I mean, we know that Trump is immediately responding by trying to put on these tariffs and just disregarding Congress, which if he really wanted to pursue these tariffs that he initially put on, he could go down the path of using the legislative branch. But right now, Trump is not interested in that. He likes to do things unilaterally and he likes to do things quickly. And so this is a significant moment in which Trump has to readjust to a real constraint on his power. Okay, I want to just pull back for a minute. One thing that does seem clear is that we are now living in a world with tariffs. Whether we're talking about 15% tariffs or higher, the US seems to have permanently at this point moved away from truly and absolutely abiding by free trade principles and moved toward a definitively more protectionist and nationalist economy by default. How should we think about that? You know over the next decade irrespective of what's just happened here there is going to be an element of tariffs that are going to be part of our lives and are going to be part of all of these countries and companies lives and as a result it really has shifted potentially permanently or at least semi-permanmanently the relationship the United States has with the rest of the world.

Well, Tyler, Anna, Andrew, thanks for coming on the show.

>> Thank you.
>> Thanks so much, Natalie.
>> Thanks for having us.

>> We'll be right back.
Here's what else you need to know.
Today, an armed man was shot and killed by law enforcement officers after he entered the secure perimeter of Mara Lago early Sunday morning. The local sheriff identified the man as Austin Tucker Martin, a 21-year-old from North Carolina. Authorities say Martin was carrying what appeared to be a shotgun and a fuel canister and that when he was ordered to drop the items, he put down the canister but raised the shotgun to a shooting position, prompting officers to open fire. President Trump wasn't at the resort at the time. He had hosted state governors at the White House the night before.
And heavy snow pounded through the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic on Sunday as a major winter storm forced widespread transit shutdowns and thousands of flight cancellations. Over 35 million people from eastern Maryland to eastern Massachusetts were under blizzard warnings. More than 2 ft of snow is expected in parts of New England. If New York City snowfall hits 18 in as forecast, it would be the heaviest in a decade. The city banned non-essential travel until noon on Monday, and officials in New Jersey imposed a travel ban for most drivers that's expected to lift around 7:00 a.m. on Monday. As of Sunday night, most flights in and out of Kennedy Airport, LaGuardia Airport, and Newark Airport had been cancelled. Governors in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, and Delaware declared states of emergency.

Today's episode was produced by Diana Wyn and Mooj Zadei. It was edited by Devin Taylor and Lisa Chow. Contains music by Marian Lozano and Dan Powell. And was engineered by Chris Wood. That's it for the Daily. I'm Natalie Kitrowette. See you tomorrow.

### 白宫的混乱反应与替代方案

最高法院的裁决令特朗普总统极为愤怒，他在一次简报会上公开表达了不满，并迅速召集幕僚商议对策。随后，行政部门在不到24小时内采取了混乱的行动：先是宣布实施10%的普遍关税，紧接着又在周末将其提高至15%。这种快速且反复的政策调整令许多顾问和内部人士感到意外。有猜测认为，总统此举是为了回应媒体对其“失利”的报道，意在展示其仍有能力提高关税。然而，总统本人并未就此次快速变动给出明确解释。

在应对策略上，行政部门并未止步于15%的普遍关税。由于此前依赖的《国际紧急经济权力法》（International Emergency Economic Powers Act）因灵活性高但易受法律挑战，现在正转向更具弹性的法律框架。其中，**301条款**（Section 301）允许通过调查不公平贸易行为来征收关税，这曾是特朗普政府对华的主要手段；而**232条款**（Section 232）则允许基于国家安全理由征收关税。目前实施的15%普遍关税将在五个月后到期，若要延长，特朗普需要国会批准，这在临近中期选举且选民普遍关注物价上涨的背景下，可能性较低。这种不确定性也成为企业制定计划时的重要考量因素。

### 企业与国家的双重不确定性

此次裁决对企业界造成了巨大冲击。许多企业在过去几个月内，为了应对特朗普政府的关税政策，已经重塑了**供应链**（Supply Chain: 产品从原材料到最终交付的整个流程），将生产线从中国转移至印度等地，并承诺将制造业迁回美国。如今，这些基于原有关税预期的成本核算和战略布局都面临失效的风险，导致企业高层对未来走向感到极度困惑和担忧。

对于已支付的巨额关税，企业界普遍关注能否获得退款。例如，**丰田汽车**（Toyota）将约80亿美元的损失归咎于关税，**福特汽车**（Ford）和**通用汽车**（General Motors）也报告了数十亿美元的关税相关成本。然而，获得退款并非易事。企业可能需要提起诉讼，且必须在规定时间内提交申请，这往往意味着需要公开披露信息。更深层次的担忧在于，公开寻求退款是否会招致行政部门的**报复**（Retaliation: 采取反制措施）。鉴于特朗普政府过往的强硬手段，一些企业可能因担心被“穿小鞋”而选择放弃追讨。

小型企业在此困境中尤为不利。它们缺乏资源聘请昂贵的律师和说客与政府沟通，在应对关税复杂性、争取退款方面处于明显劣势。这种复杂性本身就消耗了企业大量本应用于核心业务的时间和精力。此外，关税政策的频繁变动和不确定性严重打击了企业的投资信心，因为企业难以在政策可能随时剧变的未来进行长期、大规模的投资决策。

Okay, Andrew, I want to talk about what the future may hold for these companies, but I have to ask. It seems as though the corporate world that you cover has been really focused on the question of what this decision means about the tariffs they've already paid, about the past, whether and how they might get refunds on the billions in costs they've already racked up. What do we know about that? So look, you you can look at companies like Toyota, which recently attributed about $8 billion of losses to the tariffs. Ford said that the tariff related charges cost them $2 billion in 2025. They're expecting over a billion dollars in 2026. Uh General Motors uh is in somewhat of a similar camp. So there are a lot of businesses that have been impacted uh by this that they can look directly at those losses and say they want that money back. There's a real question about whether they can get that money back, how the refund process works, when you actually have to sue effectively or put in for the refund, you might need to do it relatively quickly, which also means you have to do it publicly. Mhm.

>> Again, this question of when you publicly seek a refund, what does that ultimately also mean for your business if it's regulated in some other way by the US government and if you're concerned at all about the administration somehow coming back at you in another way,

>> retaliating? You're you're saying basically there may be some risk for these businesses in confronting the president on this. You know, this administration has aggressively pursued companies in so many different ways, whether it be law firms or you can look at some of the big media companies or so many other instances where they have used their regulatory powers against corporations that they did not believe were quote unquote on side, if you will, with this administration. And therefore, I think there's a big question about, you know, whether some of these companies will seek refunds or not.

Anna, you regularly talk to small businesses who have been affected by the tariffs. I wonder whether they are at a disadvantage in terms of getting refunds given everything that's involved. What are you hearing?

>> Yeah, absolutely. So, small businesses tend to have fewer resources. They can't hire the high price lawyers, the lobbyists to come in and talk to the Trump administration. And that has really made a difference in how different industries and companies have been treated over the past year. And I think, you know, one thing is that this tariff system has just added this huge amount of complexity for businesses to deal with. And that takes resources. I hear from companies all the time that instead of doing, you know, their business, they're spending time figuring out these tariffs. And so that's a big cost for companies. It's hard to describe just how complicated the Trump's tariff system was before the Supreme Court ruling. There were different rates for different countries, different products. Now that is all gone. It's replaced with an entirely very different set system of tariffs. There's a 150day clock running on that with big questions about what is going to replace it.

>> And all that uncertainty is just it's bad for investment. I mean, companies are not going to want to invest billions of dollars in a factory that will take years to build if tariff policy is going to change dramatically in the next few months.

### 全球贸易协定与地缘政治博弈

最高法院的裁决不仅影响美国国内，也对国际贸易关系产生了连锁反应。许多国家与美国达成的贸易协议，其基础是基于特朗普政府设定的关税水平。如今，这些关税基础的消失，使得协议的有效性受到质疑。例如，欧盟官员已表示可能暂停其贸易协议的批准。一些国家，如英国和澳大利亚，此前为降低关税率付出了巨大代价，而现在却发现自己与其他国家一样，面临着新的15%普遍关税，这引发了对当初做出让步的合理性反思。

各国在应对这一局面时，也面临着与美国政府的潜在冲突风险。虽然总统的单方面关税权力受到限制，但他仍可通过其他关税授权（如301条款和232条款）对不合作的国家施加压力。因此，许多国家在采取行动前会审慎评估，以免招致报复。**中国**（China）作为未与美国达成贸易协议的主要经济体，其处境尤为引人关注。此前，特朗普政府曾对中国施加高额关税，而现在，中国可能面临一个相对较低的关税率，这使得其在与美国的博弈中占据了相对有利的位置。这种“玩命游戏”（playing chicken）的动态，以及各国和企业对未来关税政策走向的观望，正在重塑全球贸易秩序。

>> Okay, we're going to get to those bigger implications. Andrew, I have what may seem like a technical question for you. We talked on the show before about the question surrounding who was actually paying for the tariffs. Were the companies eating the cost or were they passing it on to consumers? If the companies raised prices because of tariffs, can they actually legitimately get refunds?

>> You are asking what may be the $175 billion question, which is to say there is an argument that may be made by this administration in court if a company comes to seek a refund. It is possible that the administration will argue that they effectively raised prices, didn't suffer or subject themselves therefore to a loss, and therefore effectively have no standing to collect a refund.

>> And Tyler, how is the administration thinking about this question of companies potentially demanding massive refunds?

>> Natalie, they're not really seeming to think about it all that much at all. We saw Treasury Secretary Scott Pess say he didn't think that the American people would see this money and the president at his news conference on Friday basically ignored questions about refunds. And so even as reporters repeatedly tried to press him, he has very much quickly moved on and has started talking about new tariffs that he wants to institute. and there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of consideration about what this process may look like should companies start requesting them.

>> Yeah, I think it's pretty clear that they're not going to be very enthusiastic about paying that money back. The question is how, you know, cooperative they are with any eventual court order. um it will really be up to the administration to set up this system for refunds and that could be you know it could be an easy process if they wanted to make it that way or it could be kind of a nightmare for companies. You know honestly I I wouldn't be surprised if it's months or even years by the time this process plays out in court by the time this system is set up and companies actually get that money in their hands. Can I say part of the political decision by this administration to pursue tariffs the way he did was because of the expectation that even if they were overturned, it would be very difficult to get the refunds back.

>> H you're saying it was part of the design?

>> All of this was part of the design because by default it forced these companies and these countries into this particular situation. some of whom have made commitments, not just commitments, but have made investments that are very hard to turn back on now.

>> Yeah. So, essentially, you could see these tariffs as a year of a kind of corporate tax. Is that fair?

>> Some people would call them a corporate tax. Some people would call them a tax on consumers. The administration would call them a tax on other countries.

>> After the break, we look at those other countries and the global fallout from the tariff ruling. We'll be right back.
So Anna, I want to talk about all the agreements that Trump has reached, all the deals he's reached with other countries, trade deals that everyone from Europe to Japan has made based on what have now been deemed illegal tariffs. Are those deals now moot?

Well, it's still kind of up in the air. So, countries have agreed to major concessions over the last few months. The administration has made initial trade deals that in a lot of cases are kind of vague, but you know, still deals with dozens of countries in which they've agreed to drop tariffs, make big investments in the United States. And now the tariffs that underly those are suddenly gone. But you already see some hesitation on the part of other countries, you know, that have agreed to these terms. So you had officials in the EU saying recently that they might pause the ratification of their trade deal. And the other piece of this is that this new system, this flat 15% tariff for everybody for some countries feels really, really unfair because they have made a lot of concessions to the United States in order to lower their tariff rates. Now they're right back where everybody else is. So countries like Britain and Australia were at 10%. Now they're at 15% along with other countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, India. So a lot of people in other countries just questioning whether they should have made all these concessions to the president for tariffs that are not now in effect. But Anna, do these countries not have the same risks that we talked about companies having in terms of, you know, poking the bear, potentially confronting Trump? Couldn't that be dangerous for them if he responds, if he retaliates?

>> Yeah, absolutely. I think they do have a lot of risk when it comes to poking the bear. The president has been restrained by this Supreme Court ruling. He's not able to use that emergency power, but he has a lot of other tariff authorities and he can still, you know, levy just incredible taxes on their imports. So, a lot of countries are not backing away from their deals right away. They're very cognizant that the president has these other tariff powers that he could just whack them with if they do decide to break their agreement. The administration has also warned other countries that they will in fact do that. you know, sometimes it may take writing a report or it may take, you know, a few weeks or months, but he can still, you know, levy just incredible taxes on their imports. That makes a huge difference to industries in other countries that are trying to sell products to the United States. You know, the other piece of this is the biggest country that didn't make a trade deal with the United States, which is China. You know, Trump had threatened something like 125% tariffs on China. He had put very high tariffs on China before they were ruled illegal. And now China has this much lower rate. So I wonder where that leaves us.

>> I think this goes back to the the bigger issue about countries and companies playing chicken with the administration. And you could argue that China has played the best game of chicken yet because they didn't accept some kind of higher rate earlier and they did try to slow roll and play out these negotiations as long as possible. And you heard early on that some countries had thought about approaching it that way. But there became this sort of view especially as a couple of countries early on accepted these deals that this was the future that irrespective of what the Supreme Court said that tariffs in one way or another are here to stay for some period of time that was going to sort of rewrite the global trade order.

>> And Natalie, I think we're going to get a lot more on this front because the president is expected to travel to Beijing.

>> Yep. at the end of March, early April and meet with Xi Jinping. So, we should expect there to be a lot more conversation about what the USChina relationship looks like, particularly as it pertains to trade in the weeks ahead.

### 总统权力的制约与经济模式的转变

特朗普总统在国际舞台上的核心权力来源之一——广泛的关税授权——因此次最高法院裁决而受到严重削弱。这种权力不仅用于达成贸易协议，更是其外交政策的基石，通过关税作为“棍棒”迫使他国就范。此次裁决剥夺了他随意挥舞关税大棒的能力，使其在谈判中的**议价能力**（Leverage: 谈判中的优势或影响力）大打折扣。虽然他仍能通过其他法律途径实施关税，但这需要更周密的计划，而非即时的、随意的行动。

此次事件标志着特朗普总统首次真正感受到宪法赋予的**制衡**（Checks and Balances: 权力制衡）的约束。此前，国会（即使在共和党控制下）大多顺从其意愿，最高法院也未对其权力构成实质性限制。现在，他必须面对权力边界，并调整其单边主义的行事风格。有法律专家指出，总统目前采用的替代性关税授权（如第122条）本身也可能面临新的法律挑战，预示着未来可能重回最高法院。

更深远的意义在于，美国似乎已永久性地告别了纯粹的自由贸易原则，转向了更加**保护主义**（Protectionism: 国家通过贸易限制来保护本国产业的政策）和**民族主义**（Nationalism: 强调国家利益至上的意识形态）的经济模式。无论未来关税的具体形式如何，它们都将成为美国及其全球贸易伙伴生活中不可分割的一部分。这种转变可能永久性地重塑美国与世界其他国家的关系。

>> So, okay, just thinking about where all this leaves Trump on the global stage moving forward, obviously the president now has just lost this major source of power that he's been relying on. What the broad tariff authority had given him was leverage in dealmaking, not just on trade deals, right, but also in his foreign policy generally. He's been achieving what he wants around the world in part by using tariffs as a cudgel to force countries to the table to force him to give him things they want. Now he doesn't have that. What impact does that loss of leverage have? Tyler, let's start with you.

>> Yeah, it's enormous. I mean, it was the centerpiece, arguably of his foreign policy. He used it often for economic reasons, but he also tried to use it to cut peace deals. We know that the president is very determined to win the Nobel Peace Prize. He repeatedly brags about how many conflicts he solved overseas. And at the core of some of those strategies was threatening tariffs on countries if they didn't, in his words, lay down their arms and stop fighting. And so it dramatically changes his negotiating position on the world stage because he's unable to, as Anna very clearly laid out, apply different tariff rates to different countries at a whim. And I think it left a lot of foreign leaders uncertain about what move they made and whether or not they could be punished by the president for whatever they might do. that uncertainty has been diminished in some ways because the president can't just unilaterally apply different tariffs to different countries on any given day.

>> Right? I mean, one one source said to me that this takes away Trump's lightning bolt powers. So, his Zeuslike ability to just, you know,

>> strike other countries with tariffs. It doesn't take away the ability to do tariffs at all. It just requires some planning. So I think you will continue to see the president use the threat of tariffs. It's just you won't see the rate change tomorrow.

>> I think it's also worth pointing out that the president in implementing these new tariffs at 15% across the board is using something called section 122. And it is very possible that the way he's approaching it even this time is going to be brought to court all over again. Neil Katiel, who was the lawyer who brought the original case and went to the Supreme Court and argued it there successfully now, has made this point over the weekend that there's an argument potentially that the president cannot use section 122 in the way that he is attempting to. And so we could be back here 6 months from now again in front of the Supreme Court over this too.

>> That's interesting. You're saying basically that the authorities that the president is now using as an alternative may themselves be challenged. I just want to push though on something which is that we're talking about the president having a weaker hand in negotiations being more constrained and legally that is functionally true. Right? he can no longer just wake up one day and slap 50% tariffs on major trading partners. But I still think though that for a lot of people, it's just hard to believe that that's actually going to happen when you see Trump getting up there at his presser on Friday and essentially saying that's not going to work. I am going to find ways to put tariffs in place and they're going to be even more severe. This is new for President Trump. Congress controlled by Republicans has largely gone along with everything he's wanted to do and the Supreme Court had not limited his power in any major way before this decision. And so for the president, it's a moment where he has to reckon with the checks and balance inherent in the Constitution that for most of his first year in office, he has not really felt constrained by. You're saying this is something we haven't really seen in any major way until this ruling and we don't actually know how Trump is going to respond.

>> Yeah. I mean, we know that Trump is immediately responding by trying to put on these tariffs and just disregarding Congress, which if he really wanted to pursue these tariffs that he initially put on, he could go down the path of using the legislative branch. But right now, Trump is not interested in that. He likes to do things unilaterally and he likes to do things quickly. And so this is a significant moment in which Trump has to readjust to a real constraint on his power. Okay, I want to just pull back for a minute. One thing that does seem clear is that we are now living in a world with tariffs. Whether we're talking about 15% tariffs or higher, the US seems to have permanently at this point moved away from truly and absolutely abiding by free trade principles and moved toward a definitively more protectionist and nationalist economy by default. How should we think about that? You know over the next decade irrespective of what's just happened here there is going to be an element of tariffs that are going to be part of our lives and are going to be part of all of these countries and companies lives and as a result it really has shifted potentially permanently or at least semi-permanmanently the relationship the United States has with the rest of the world.
