### Zohran Mamdani的意外崛起

**Joe Weisenthal:** 大家好，欢迎收听《OddLots》播客的又一期节目，我是Joe Weisenthal。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to another episode of the OddLots podcast. I'm Joe Weisenthal.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 我是Tracy Alloway。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I'm Tracy Aloway.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 一位前《OddLots》嘉宾很可能成为纽约市的下一任市长。没错，我们采访了**Zohran Mamdani**（美国政治家，纽约州众议院议员，民主社会主义者），那是在五月初。在那之后，我不是要居功，但他的民调支持率确实开始飙升，并最终赢得了民主党提名。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A former OddLods guest is very likely to be the next mayor of New York City. That's right. So, we interviewed Zoran Mumdani. I think it was in early May. And right after that, I'm not saying I'm not going to take credit for this, but right after that, he really started to surge in the polls and he went on to win the Democratic nomination.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 我觉得我们只能获得非常非常小的功劳，这肯定只是个巧合。实际上，那期节目之后让我印象深刻的是，很多人都表示：“我一点也不喜欢他的任何想法，但我仍然喜欢这个人，而且我仍然觉得他令人印象深刻，聪明，对政策有非常强的理解。”看，我并不认为他的胜利归功于我们，但我确实认为这很有说服力，因为很多可能在纸面上不应该或不会真正喜欢他某些观点的人，似乎并没有特别受到他的威胁。我觉得这真的很有趣，可能也促成了他非凡的胜利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think we take very, very minor credit. I'm sure it was a coincidence. The thing actually that struck me after that episode was hearing from a lot of people who were basically like I don't like any of his ideas at all but I still like the guy and I still found him impressive and intelligent and very strong understanding of policy and look I don't think his victory is attributable to us but I did think that was telling in the sense that a lot of people who maybe on paper shouldn't or wouldn't really like some of his views, didn't seem particularly threatened by him, which I thought was like really interesting and may have contributed to his sort of extraordinary margin, his extraordinary victory.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我确实认为这个故事有趣之处在于纽约市作为资本主义和商业中心所面临的张力。这里有很多资金，显然也有很多亿万富翁，他们有自己的利益。现在，你有一位民主社会主义候选人，他提出了一些新的主张。尽管有些人会说，在1950年代和1960年代的纽约，我们曾有过类似的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I do think what's interesting about this whole story is the tension between New York City as this hub of capitalism, this hub of business. You have a lot of money here, a lot of billionaires obviously with their own interests. And now you have this Democratic socialist candidate who's proposing something a little bit new. Although some people would say we had something more similar to that in say the 1950s, 1960s New York.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 但这种张力正是我现在觉得非常引人入胜的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But that tension is what I find really fascinating right now.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的，所以我们必须了解更多。我的意思是，在选举前夕，纽约市的商业和金融精英们现在在想些什么？他们如何看待Mamdani可能担任市长？他们对纽约市整体有什么看法？所有这些事情，有很多值得学习的地方。这将成为我们未来一段时间内有趣的丰富素材。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So we have to we have to learn more. I mean, again, in the run-up to the election, like what are New York City's business, financial elites thinking right now? What do they think of a possible Mandani Mery? What do they think about New York City in general? All of this stuff. There's a lot to there's a lot to learn. This is going to be a rich vein of interesting stuff for us for a while.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 我想，我们现在要谈论纽约的本地政治了。但我确实认为它具有全国性的影响。所以，我们应该谈谈它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're going all New York local politics, I guess. But I do think it has national consequences. So, we should talk about it.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我们当然应该谈谈它。总之，我真的很兴奋。我们确实请到了一位完美的嘉宾来谈论这座城市的商业精英、亿万富翁等是如何看待这座城市、看待这次选举以及Mamdani可能成为市长的可能性。我们将与**Kathy Wild**女士对话。她是**纽约市伙伴关系组织**（Partnership for New York City: 一个商业领袖组织）的总裁兼首席执行官。这个组织汇集了各种主要雇主。如果你在媒体上读到任何关于Kathy的文章，她都被描述为纽约市最终极的权力掮客之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We should definitely talk about it. Anyway, I'm really excited. We do have indeed the perfect guest to talk about how the city's business elite billionaires etc. are thinking about the city, thinking about the election, the possibility of Madani being the mayor. We're going to be speaking with Kathy Wild. She is the president and CEO of the Partnership for New York City, which is an organization, a business leadership organization here. All kinds of major employers. If you read any article about Kathy in the media described as sort of one of the ultimate power brokers of New York City,</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 是的，像“权力掮客”、“权力玩家”这样的词经常出现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah, words like power brokers, power player comes up</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 在每一篇文章中都有，所以她确实是完美的嘉宾。Kathy，非常感谢您来到《OddLots》。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">in every single one and so truly the perfect guest. So, Kathy, thank you so much for coming on OddLots.</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 谢谢Joe和Tracy邀请我。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you for having me, Joe and Tracy.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 没问题，我们非常高兴。在我们继续之前，您能否先描述一下**纽约市伙伴关系组织**是什么，以及您在那里主要做些什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely. We're really excited. Why don't you just before we move on, describe what the partnership for New York City is and what you basically do there.</p>
</details>

### 纽约市伙伴关系组织：背景与职责

**Kathy Wild:** 伙伴关系组织是为城市利益服务的商业机构。它不是商会。它是在1975年城市财政危机之后，由当时**大通银行**（Chase Bank）董事长**David Rockefeller**（美国著名银行家、慈善家）以及其他主要公司首席执行官共同组建的。这些公司不仅总部设在纽约，而且是纽约真正的公民，是其医院和博物馆的受托人，也是城市重要的慈善捐助者。因此，它是一个非常注重商业的组织，旨在利用商界的专业知识和影响力来支持纽约市，并将其维持为一个拥有巨大经济机会的城市。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The partnership is business working in the interests of the city. It's not a chamber of commerce. It was organized after the city's 1975 physical crisis by David Rockefeller who was then the chair of Chase Bank and other CEOs of the major corporations that were not just businesses headquartered in New York but were real citizens of New York and trustees of its hospitals and museums and real contributors to the city as philanthropists. So it is very much a business organization that is designed to tap the expertise and the influence of the business community to support New York City and to maintain it as the city of great economic opportunity.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 伙伴关系组织通常与市长行政部门的关系如何？有没有你们合作过并成功做成某事或改变政策方向的例子？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's the partnership's relationship like typically with the mayoral administration? And are there examples where you've worked together to effectively do something or maybe change the path of policy?</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 当然有。伙伴关系组织与政府的关系，实际上是作为商业和政府之间的中间人。正如我所说，它提供专业知识、建议和反馈，更多地是作为一种资源，而不是地方政府的对手，特别是地方州政府，以及在某些程度上，当华盛顿正在考虑对纽约产生重大影响的压倒性问题时，也会与联邦政府合作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, absolutely. The partnership's relationship to government is really as an intermediary between business and government. as I said to provide expertise, to provide advice, to give feedback, really to be a resource more than an adversary of with the local government in particular, local state government and some extent the federal government when there are overriding issues that make a big impact on New York that are being considered in Washington.</p>
</details>

### 商界对Mamdani胜选的震惊

**Joe Weisenthal:** Zohran Mamdani是什么时候进入您所接触的那些人，比如首席执行官们的视野的？是在选举前一个月吗？他们之前有考虑过他吗？选举前三个月呢？我很好奇，他们是什么时候意识到民主党可能会提名一位社会主义者的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When did Zoron come on the radar of the people that you talked to, of the CEOs, etc. like in the runup like was it a month before? Was he were they thinking about him at all? Three months before the election. I'm sort of curious like when it may have flickered in their minds that the Democratic party could nominate a socialist.</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 我不得不说，那是在初选之夜，大约晚上10点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would have to say that it was primary night about 10:00.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 真的吗？这对我来说简直难以置信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Really? Yeah. Incredible to me. That's incredible to me.</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 我曾预警过他们这是一种可能性，但我认为**Andrew Cuomo**（美国政治家，曾任纽约州州长）作为**Mario Cuomo**（美国政治家，曾任纽约州州长）的儿子，作为总检察长，作为州长，已经在他们的生活中存在了二十多年。所以，这几乎是一个既定的结论，大家认为我们认识的这个人，现在竞选市长，就一定会成为市长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I I had forewarned them that it was a possibility, but I think Cuomo had been a figure in their lives as Mario's son, as attorney general, as governor for 20ome years. And it was kind of a foregone conclusion is the guy we know who's now running for mayor is going to be mayor.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 特别是在市长**Eric Adams**宣布他不会参加民主党初选之后。所以他们已经接受了Cuomo会是市长的事实，而且几乎没有人见过Zohran。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">And especially after Mayor Adams announced he was not going to be in the Democratic primary. And so they had kind of zeroed in on accepting that it was going to be Cuomo and really no one had met Zoron.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 初选之夜的气氛如何？大家是不是立刻回家，在网上或ChatGPT上搜索“社会主义”？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What was the mood like on primary night? Did everyone immediately go home and start looking up socialism on the internet on chat GPT?</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 嗯，我想“歇斯底里”会是一个很好的形容词。首先是震惊，震惊之后是“发生了什么？这个人是谁？”所以我试图提供一些安慰。在过去的20年里，我们一直致力于推动纽约市实施**拥堵费**（congestion pricing: 对进入城市特定区域的车辆收取费用，以减少交通拥堵和污染），既是为了管理交通，也是为了让城市变得更高效。过度的交通拥堵每年给城市造成200亿美元的损失，包括时间浪费和生产力下降。而纽约之所以成为一个伟大的工作场所，正是因为其高效的劳动力。所以我们一直是拥堵费的倡导者。我实际上是在这个背景下，在**作家联盟**（Writers Alliance: 一个地铁乘客倡导团体）的活动中认识了Zohran，发现他是一个非常聪明有趣的年轻人。所以我认识他。然后去年九月他联系我，说想和我谈谈他的市长前景，当时他的民调支持率只有1%。于是我在85 Broad街的LPQ咖啡馆和他见了面，我们聊了聊，我发现他很聪明，从那时起我就开始认真对待他了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I I would say hysteria would be a good word for it. Shock was first. Shock first. And what happened and who is this person? And so I tried to provide some reassurance. We had for the past 20 years led efforts to bring congestion pricing to New York City to both manage traffic, but to really make the city a more efficient place. Excess traffic congestion was costing the city $20 billion a year with lost time, lost productivity. And what makes New York a great place to work is the productive workforce. So we'd been an advocate of congestion pricing. And I had actually met Zoron in that context at the writers alliance which is a group of subway riders advocates and had found him to be a very smart interesting young man. So I had known him and then he reached out to me last September and said I'd like to talk to you about my mayoral prospects when he was polling at 1%. And so I met him for coffee at the LPQ at 85 Broad and we had a conversation and I found him to be smart and I took him seriously from then on.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 我很佩服他那么早就想与您建立联系。在您进一步谈论他之前，我的一位朋友曾形容您是纽约市亿万富翁们的“治疗师”。他们在初选之夜歇斯底里，您觉得那天晚上您的角色就是这样吗？您觉得您是伙伴关系组织成员们的治疗师吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean I'm impressed from his perspective that that early on he wanted to sort of build that connection or make that connection with you. Before you talk more about him, a friend of mine described you as a therapist to the New York City billionaires. They were hysterical on or they're experiencing hysteria on primary night. Did you feel like that was your role in that night? Did you feel like a therapist to the members of the partnership</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 是为了给商界提供安慰。我的意思是，首先，要提醒他们，他们最担心的一些来自民主社会主义候选人的事情，他根本没有能力执行。例如，提高企业税和所得税，这不是市或市长能做到的。免费公交也不是市长能做到的，而且还要想办法弥补8亿美元的收入缺口。所以，第一点是让他们放心，我们有一位温和的州长，她正在关注商业利益，她说她不会在纽约进一步加税，而纽约已经是全国乃至世界上个人所得税和企业税最高的城市。所以，第一点是提供安慰，即：

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">to provide reassurance to the business community? I mean, number one, to remind them that many of the things they were most worried about from a so Democratic socialist candidate were things that he has absolutely no capacity to execute on. So, for example, raising corporate and income taxes is not something that the city or the mayor can do. Uh, free buses is not something the mayor can do. and figuring out where you make up that 800 million in um in revenues. So, that was number one, reassuring them that we have a moderate governor who's watching out for business interests, who says she's not going to further raise taxes in New York, which is the highest tax city in the country and in most cases the world for both individual income tax and corporate tax. So that was number one, providing reassurance that</p>
</details>

### 市长权力与制衡：商界担忧的边界

**Kathy Wild:** 即使他成为市长，他也会有自己的议程，但在纽约有很多制衡机制需要通过，这不是一个单方面就能决定的职位。然而，对于房地产界来说，这要困难得多，因为他们的担忧与土地使用程序、审批以及建筑许可等有关，而这些是市长确实可以控制的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">as mayor he would have an agenda, but there are a lot of checks and balances to work through in New York and it's not a unilateral post. Now that was more difficult with the real estate community because their concerns having to do with land use proceedings and approvals and uh construction permits etc. that the mayor does control</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 市长基本上对这个过程有巨大的控制权。这是唯一一个地方性的事务，以及房地产税，市长对此有显著影响力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">basically a huge amount of control over that process. That is the one thing that's local and real estate taxes uh where the mayor has significant influence. So it was more difficult with members of the real estate community who after the primary quickly pivoted to remembering what a good friend Mayor Adams was.</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 所以，对于房地产界的成员来说，这更困难。他们在初选后迅速转向，回想起市长Adams是多么好的朋友。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">So it was more difficult with members of the real estate community who after the primary quickly pivoted to remembering what a good friend Mayor Adams was.</p>
</details>

### Mamdani的挑战：犹太社区关系与可负担性

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我当然想更多地谈谈商界的担忧。但在那之前，我忍不住要问，当您第一次和Zohran喝咖啡时，您给了他什么建议？您实际上对他的市长竞选说了些什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I want to talk more about the concerns of the business community, obviously. But before we do, I can't resist asking, when you first met Zoran over coffee, what advice did you give him? What did you actually say to him about a mayoral run?</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 首先，我说你无法领导纽约市，除非你与犹太社区建立建设性的关系，因为这是他似乎无法解决的最明显的担忧来源，这让我非常担心。其次，解决可负担性问题不是地方政府花更多的钱。地方政府花的钱必须有出处，你需要增税来支持它。而最终，这只会增加纽约的生活成本和营商成本。所有这些最终都会转嫁给消费者。所以，可负担性问题，他强调并从一开始就强调，我们必须让纽约对不仅仅是穷人，对中产阶级，对那些租房的人来说，变得更可负担，这是绝对正确的。现在，平均租金每月接近4000美元。这是雇主们最关心的问题。我说这是他们最关心的问题：如果年轻人无法在纽约市租到公寓，我们如何留住他们？这让人非常沮丧。所以，这就是我们当时的对话，他对此持开放态度，并对学习感兴趣。我的意思是，他立刻给我留下了深刻印象，他是一个对学习更多感兴趣的人，但他有非常坚定的观点，并且非常投入。我的意思是，他33岁，前途无量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Number one, I said that you can't lead New York City unless you have a constructive relationship with the Jewish community because that was the most obvious source of concern that he seemed not able to address that worried me a lot. Number two, that the solution to affordability is not for government, local government to spend more money. That the money that local government spends has to be accounted for. That you need to raise taxes to support it. And ultimately, that just ups the cost of living and the cost of doing business in New York. And that all ends up getting passed along to consumers. So the affordability question, which he was absolutely right to emphasize and emphasize from the beginning, that we've got to make New York more affordable to not just poor people, to the middle class, to those people who rent an apartment. And now the average rents almost $4,000 a month. This is the big concern of employers. And I said this is their number one concern. How do we keep and retain young talent if they can't afford to rent an apartment in New York City? Big frustration. So, that was that was kind of the conversation that we had and he was open to that conversation and and interested in learning. I mean, he impressed me right away as somebody who is interested in learning more, but who has um has very strong opinions and is very committed. And I mean he's 33 years old and the world is his oyster.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的，您提到了与犹太社区关系的重要性。我看了那场辩论，虽然没有看全程，但我确实看了最后一场辩论，其中有一个问题是“您会首先访问哪个国家？”除了Zohran，所有候选人都说他们会访问以色列。他说他没有考虑过会访问哪里。您能从纽约市商界领袖的角度解释一下，为什么他们认为与以色列保持良好关系是市长工作如此重要的一部分？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. You mentioned the importance of relations with the Jewish community. And I saw I watched that I didn't watch the whole debate, but I did watch the last debate and there was that question about which country are you going to visit first? And every candidate Bud Sauron said he was going to they were going to visit Israel. He said he wasn't thinking about was going to visit. Can you explain from the perspective of the business leaders, New York City, why do they perceive that good relations with Israel is such an important aspect of the job of</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 是的，为什么纽约市长必须有外交政策？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Why does the mayor of New York have to have a foreign policy?</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 嗯，他们的担忧是他确实有外交政策。我不认为任何人认为纽约市长必须有外交政策，但他有就影响犹太社区和以色列的问题发表意见的记录，这让他们非常担忧。所以，他们的担忧不是纽约市没有。纽约市在支持多元化人群方面有着悠久的价值观历史，对各种宗教信仰非常宽容，并且与以色列有着悠久的历史。我的意思是，当**康奈尔科技学院**（Cornell Tech）与**以色列理工学院**（Technion: 以色列的一所大学，在以色列的“创业国家”运动中发挥了主导作用）合作时，以色列理工学院确实引领了以色列的“创业国家”运动，并极大地推动了他们的经济发展。在**Bloomberg**（美国前纽约市市长，彭博社创始人）政府时期，他们被选中在纽约罗斯福岛建立一所世界一流的工程学院，该学院非常成功，培养了大量的博士生。所以，当他们，以色列理工学院，刚来的时候，他们告诉我他们最初是如何获得资助的。是纽约的犹太慈善家资助了这项工作。所以这种长期关系一直存在。显然，我们纽约有许多大屠杀受害者和幸存者的家属，对他们来说，一个犹太家园，一个世界各地犹太人的安全之地，是头等重要的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, their fear is that he has a foreign policy. I I don't think anybody thinks the mayor of New York has to have a foreign policy, but he has a record of speaking out on issues that impact the Jewish community about Israel that they're very concerned about. And so their concern is not having New York City has uh has a long history of values that are very strong on supporting a diversity of people are very tolerant of various religious beliefs and a long history with Israel. I mean when Cornell Technon partnered on uh Technneon's the university in Israel that really led the startup nation movement in Israel and did so much to propel their economy and they were selected under the Bloomberg administration to establish a firstass engineering school in New York on Roosevelt Island which has been very successful and is producing a great number of PhDs. And so at the time that they came in, Technon came in, they told me how they had been funded originally. It was New York Jewish philanthropists that funded that effort. So there's this long-term relationship. And obviously we have many people in New York who are family of Holocaust victims and survivors and for whom the fact of a Jewish homeland a safe space for Jews around the world is of top area of importance.</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 我认为他们非常担心纽约市长是否尊重和理解以色列的重要性以及我们长期的关系。这让他们非常担忧。我认为这是一个他尚未解决的问题。我认为这很困难，因为他在年轻的犹太社区中拥有强大的支持。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that that that they are very concerned that the mayor of New York City respect and understand the importance of Israel and our long-term relationship. And that that worries them a lot. And that's an issue that I think he has yet to resolve. I think it's difficult because he has strong support in the young Jewish community</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 所以我确信他觉得很多人在保护巴勒斯坦人权利和相关担忧的问题上与他站在一起。所以，这是一个领域，他竞选并建立了关系，这些关系是纽约市的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so I'm sure he feels that he's got a lot of people who are with him on the issues of protecting the rights of the Palestinians and concerns about that. So, it's um this is an area again where the fact that he ran a campaign and had built relationships that are a piece of New York City.</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 他确实扩大了选民范围，吸引了那些以前没有参与的人，但他并没有与传统选民建立太多关系。他是在与民主党建制派对抗，而不是与他们合作。因此，犹太人口集中的社区，他并没有特别去接触，除了年轻人和社交媒体群体。而这些人并不是最关心这些问题的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh he expanded the electorate to folks who have not participated, but he really did not develop much of a relationship with the historic electorate. he was running against the Democratic establishment, not with it. And so the communities where much of the Jewish population is concentrated were not communities he was necessarily reaching out to except for the young people and the social media crowd. And that's not the people who are most concerned.</p>
</details>

### 竞选策略与资金流向

**Tracy Alloway:** 谈到竞选活动，Mamdani的获胜确实令人惊讶。他采取了草根竞选方式，非常注重社交媒体，还有很多设计有趣的周边商品。我看到过“Zohran的辣妹”T恤，通常是年轻女性在城里穿着。我很好奇，如果他们曾为Cuomo捐赠了数百万美元，而Zohran却赢了，您现在接触的这些人中，是否有人在重新考虑未来的竞选捐款？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So on the topic of the campaign, I mean this was one of the really surprising things of him winning. He had this sort of grassroots campaign which was very much focused on social media. Lots of merchandise with really interesting designs. I've seen the hot girls for Zoran t-shirts, people wearing those around town, usually young women, as you mentioned. And I'm curious, are any of the people you're speaking to perhaps thinking differently about campaign donations going forward if they donated billions of dollars for Cuomo and Zoran? What?</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 嗯，不是数十亿，而是数百万。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, not billions, but millions.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 好的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Um,</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 是的，是的。我想说，大多数人认为他们为Cuomo捐了款，但他们觉得没有得到一场很好的竞选。他们想见Zohran，我认为很多人，特别是房地产界的人，正在积极地将他们原本捐给Cuomo的款项转给Eric Adams，如果可以这么说的话。Adams是他们认识的、可以做生意的人，他一直支持城市从疫情爆发和经济状况不佳中实现巨大的积极增长，以及我们的房地产状况。Eric Adams的政府领导了重新分区工作，并且自1961年以来首次真正改变了分区法规，这一点不容忽视。所以，他在努力使城市住房开发变得更容易、成本更低的过程中投入了巨大精力，并支持了整体经济增长。

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yes. Yes. I would say that for the most part what I'm hearing is that people feel that they contributed to Cuomo and that they don't feel they got a very good campaign out of it. They want to meet Zoran and I think they're making there are many particularly in the real estate community that are stepping up to transfer whatever donations they were making to Cromo to Eric Adams, if you will, the somebody that they know they can do business with and who has been supportive of tremendously positive growth in the city from the uh nater of the pandemic and what where our economy was, where our real estate situation. Um, Eric Adams, it should not be ignored that he has, his administration has led reszoning efforts and really changed the zoning code for the first time since 1961. So, he's made a tremendous investment in trying to begin the process of making it easier and less expensive to develop housing in the city and supported economic growth overall.</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 所以，确实存在担忧。我的意思是，他显然是第一位被起诉的市长，当他退出民主党初选时，我认为这巩固了大部分资金流向Cuomo。但Eric Adams又回到了大选中，并且状态良好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there was concern. I mean, obviously he's the first mayor that's been indicted and when he dropped out of the Democratic primary, I think that solidified most of the money going to Cuomo, but Eric is back in the general and in in uh in good form.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我注意到您在第一个回答中提到，商业精英们已经“接受”了Cuomo将成为提名人。这个“接受”听起来不像“热情支持”。我听起来更像是“无可奈何地接受”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I noticed you said something in I think your first answer that the um the business elite had accepted Kuomo as who was going to be the nominee. that accepted it does not sound the same as enthusiastically support. I hear that as sort of resigned. Yeah. Okay.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 维持现状。

<p class="english-text">Status quo.</p>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的，所以，我很好奇。

<p class="english-text">Yeah. And so I'm curious like</p>

**Tracy Alloway:** 拜托，你得笑一下吧。好台词，对吧？“现状”。这确实是个好词。谢谢，谢谢。

<p class="english-text">come on, you have to laugh at that. Good lines, right? Status. That's a good one actually. Thank you. Thank you.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 说得好。但他们对Cuomo的实际感受如何？另外，我知道有些问题，目前还不清楚他是否会在11月积极参选，但如果他们确实团结在某人周围，那肯定会是Adams吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That was good. But how did they feel actually about Cuomo and also like I know there are some question. It's still unclear whether he's going to run actively in November, but if they do coales around someone, does it definitely seem like it's going to be Adams?</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 到目前为止，我认为是的，我认为会是Adams。如果，再次强调，最关心的是房地产界。您要知道，纽约的金融业基本上受到联邦法规，如**美国证券交易委员会**（SEC）、**美国金融业监管局**（FINRA）和其他法规的限制，禁止向州和地方候选人捐款超过几百美元的名义金额。因此，他们大多不是州和地方选举中的主要金主，这确实使纽约的商界处于不利地位，他们占我们税基的约40%，却无法参与支持他们选择的候选人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So far, I think yes, I think it's going to be Adams. If if and again, it is um the real estate community that's most concerned. You understand that the financial industry in New York basically is prohibited by federal regulation SEC and FINRA and other regulation from contributing to state and local candidates beyond a nominal amount of a few hundred dollars. So they are not for the most part money players in state and local elections which has really disadvantaged New York's business community which represents like 40% of our tax base who can't participate in supporting candidates of their choice.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 嗯，他们可以像Zohran的志愿者那样敲门。他们只是不能捐赠大量资金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, they can knock on doors like the Zoron volunteers did. They just can't donate gobs of money</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 那会很棒，但不会发生。好的。嗯，他们中的大多数人已经过了敲门的年纪了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and that would be great but not happening. Okay. Um it's uh most of them are beyond the doornocking age.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 当然。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure.</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 但您关于Cuomo的问题，Cuomo在金融危机期间担任总检察长，对金融业并不十分友好，在他担任总检察长期间，他没有与商界建立非常积极的关系。所以，那是他的职责，要成为一名执法者。在他担任州长期间，他带着非常强烈的议程上任，试图控制州支出和税收。但在**医疗补助**（Medicaid）改革和养老金改革方面取得了一些实际进展后，随着政治风向的改变，他与商界的关系就不再像以前那样了。所以，除了房地产领域，他在基础设施投资和支持房地产开发方面非常支持增长。因此，我想说他在房地产界有相对的热情，但在商界整体上并没有广泛的支持。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But your question about Cuomo, Cuomo was attorney general during the financial crisis and was not very friendly toward the financial industry and did not develop relationships that were very positive during his tenure as attorney general with the business community. So, and that was his job to be an enforcer. And during his term as governor, he came in with a very strong agenda to try and get state spending under control and get taxes under control. But having made some some real progress there on Medicaid reform and pension reform as the political winds changed. Uh there wasn't that same relationship with the business community. So with the exception of real estate where he was very progrowth investing in infrastructure supporting real estate development. So I would say that he had relative enthusiasm in the real estate community but not broadly based in the business community.</p>

### 商界领袖与Mamdani的对话

**Tracy Alloway:** 谈到这一点，您多次强调，许多商界领袖显然都想与Zohran对话。他们想与他面对面交流。我相信您正在组织商界与市长候选人之间的讨论，我想是在下周。我们录制这期节目是在7月9日。您如何决定谁能与Zohran见面？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So on this note, you've emphasized a number of times that a lot of business leaders obviously want to talk to Zoran. They want to get in the room with him. And you are organizing, I believe, discussions between the business community and the mayoral candidate, I think, next week. We're recording this on, let's see, July 9th. How do you decide who gets to be in the room with Zoran?</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 嗯，我们正在进行的第一次会议，是我和Zohran一起安排的。他在选举后立即给我打电话，说他想建立这些关系。我说：“好的，那我们来安排。”所以，我们安排了与伙伴关系组织首席执行官们的会议，那是在周二。届时，有些人会通过线上加入，但大部分会是线下会议，大约150位主要公司和城市主要雇主的首席执行官，他们从未见过他。他们将首次获得这个机会。这将是一场与我们的联合主席**Tishman Speyer**的**Rob Speyer**和**辉瑞**（Pfizer）的**Albert Bourla**博士的对话。他们将与Zohran进行对话，然后我们会与我们的成员进行一些问答。所以，这是第一步。然后，嗯……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, the first meeting we're doing, and I set this up with Zoran, he called me right after the election and and said he wanted to establish those relationships. And I said, "Well, let's" So, we set up a meeting with the CEOs of the partnership that's on Tuesday. And so, there'll be some will join virtually, but it's going to be mostly an in-person 150 maybe CEOs of major companies, major employers in the city who have never met him. And we'll be for the first time getting the opportunity. That's going to be a conversation with our co-chairs Rob Spire of Tishman Spire and Dr. Albert Burla of Fizer. And so they'll be having a conversation with Sauron and then we'll have some Q&A with our members. And so that's that's number one. And then um</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 您下周会回来，对吧？我们会做这期节目的后续，然后您告诉我们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you'll come back next week, right? And we'll do a follow-up to this episode and you just tell us.</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 会很有趣的。是的，我期待着那次对话。但我认为，这再次是一次介绍。正如您所知，我见过他，我对他充满信心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It'll be interesting. Yes, I'm I'm looking forward I'm looking forward to that conversation. But I think again it's an introduction and I have full confidence as you know having met him. Yeah,</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** Zohran很擅长展示自己，而且在对问题做出深思熟虑的回答方面非常迅速。所以我很期待，因为那会省去我很多时间去向大家保证他不是魔鬼，他没问题。然后周三，**Kevin Ryan**（**AlleyCorp**公司创始人，被称为“硅巷之父”，在纽约创建了许多科技公司）将主持一场与他的对话，这将非常侧重于科技，更多的是企业家而不是企业金融人士。所以那将在周三举行。我还应该补充一点，周四我们将与市长Eric Adams共进早餐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Zoran is pretty good at presenting himself and very fast in terms of his thoughtful responses on issues. So I'm looking forward to that because it'll save me a lot of time reassuring him that he's not the devil. He's okay. And then on Wednesday, Kevin Ryan, who is kind of the father of Silicon Alley, Ali Corp is the name of his corporation and has has a prolific history of creating tech companies in New York. Kevin is going to moderate a conversation with him which will be heavily tech focused, more entrepreneurs than corporate finance types. So that'll be on Wednesday. And then I should add that on Thursday we'll be doing breakfast with Mayor Eric Adams.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 好的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay,</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 并与他讨论未来的发展道路。正如我所说，Eric Adams的政策得到了很多支持。他刚上任市长时，我也和Eric有过同样的对话。我是布鲁克林人，所以认识Eric很多年了，最近一次是在他担任布鲁克林区区长期间。但我们刚开始时，他也不认识纽约商界的任何人。但他介绍自己时说：“我的第一要务是公共安全。我的第二要务是经济繁荣，我与你们同在。”在经历了**Bill de Blasio**（美国政治家，曾任纽约市市长）担任市长的八年之后，他对他们除了说“你们是糟糕的人”之外，什么也没做，什么也没说。正如**Jamie Dimon**（美国银行家，摩根大通首席执行官）曾说过的名言：“八年来，Bill de Blasio担任市长时从未给我打过电话，也从未与我交谈过。”所以Eric立即扭转了de Blasio“大企业对纽约有害”的观点，Eric说：“我希望纽约有富人，我希望纽约有大企业。”所以我预计下周Zohran不会这样说。我不会，我认为他不会对亿万富翁抱有同样的热情，但我确实期望他表现得像一个负责任的人，认真思考问题，并且乐于学习，最重要的是倾听和学习。我认为，最主要的担忧是，他是否是一个教条主义的意识形态者，对我们能为城市贡献什么，或者雇主能贡献什么不感兴趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and speaking to him about his path forward. And as I said, there's been a lot of support for the policies that Eric Adams has. He started out as mayor. I had the same conversation with Eric. I'm a Brooklyn person, so I've known Eric for many years and most recently in his capacity as Brooklyn burough president. But when we started out, he didn't know anybody in the New York business community either. But he introduced himself as saying, "My number one priority is public safety. And my number two priority is a thriving economy, and I'm with you." And having lived through eight years of Bill Delasio as mayor, who had nothing to do or to say to them except, "You're awful people." And as Jamie Diamond famously said, "For eight years, I never got a call from Bill Delasio when he was mayor and have never have never had a conversation with him." So Eric immediately reversed the Delasio big business is bad for New York and Eric said, "I want wealthy people in New York. I want big business in New York." So I don't expect that from Zoran uh next week. I I don't I think that that he's not going to have the same unbridled enthusiasm for billionaires, but I do expect that he will come across as a responsible person who's thinking seriously and is open to learning, which is most important to listening and learning. And I think that that that the number one concern is is this a dogmatic ideological person who is just going to is is going to be um not interested in what we can contribute to the city or what employers contribute.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 您提到了Kevin Ryan。我以前为**商业内幕**（Business Insider: AlleyCorp旗下公司之一）工作过，所以我是他在纽约市投资的受益者。您知道，在初选之夜，我收到了一些随机的在线消息，他们说：“你要离开纽约市吗？”我说：“我永远不会离开纽约市。”显然，它是世界上最好的城市。但是，人们确实会离开，在2021年和2022年，人们假装认为迈阿密是更好的选择。我想他们中的很多人都回来了，或者他们只是在那里待了最短的时间，以便获得当地税收优惠等。在您看来，或者在纽约市雇主看来，有哪些实质性的威胁会让他们说：“好吧，这会显著改变在这个城市做生意的吸引力”？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You mentioned Kevin Ryan. I used to work for Business Insider which one of the Alley Corp companies. So I'm a beneficiary of his New York City investments. You know, when the night of the primary, I got some random messages online. They're like, "Are you going to leave New York City? I'm never going to leave New York City." Like, it's the best city in the world, obviously. But, you know, people do leave and in 2021 and 2022, people pretended to think that Miami was a better option for them. I think a bunch of them came back or they spent just the, you know, minimum amount of time there so they could, you know, qualify for their local taxes, etc. In your view or in the view of the employers of New York City, what are the threats, the substantive threats that would say, okay, this would meaningfully change the desiraability of doing business in this town?</p>
</details>

### 纽约商业环境面临的实质性威胁

**Kathy Wild:** 第一是公共安全。他们再次赞赏，特别是在**Jesse Tisch**局长领导下，以及最初在**Kan Su**局长领导下，Adams政府一直专注于公共安全，而且我们正在……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Number one is public safety and that's again they've appreciated particularly under Commissioner Tish and originally under Commissioner uh Kan Su, they have appreciated that the Adams administration has focused on public safety and that we're</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 这比税收等事情对他们更重要吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and that's more important than things like taxes for them. Yes, absolutely.</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 是的，绝对是。因为商业在这里的整个基础就是人才库。如果人才不想留在这里，如果他们害怕留在纽约市，如果他们担心乘坐地铁时可能被抢劫或被推到火车前，那将是纽约可能发生的最糟糕的事情。所以，重要的是，Zohran已经承认，保持纽约作为人才目的地是他的优先事项。所以，我认为这个信息非常重要。所以，公共安全是第一位的，然后正如我之前所说，经济适用房和可负担性，这再次允许人才留在这里，并且没有过高的成本。我的意思是，在大多数行业中，纽约市的工资至少比你在德克萨斯州或佛罗里达州等地的工资高出20%。当它更高时，就很难向股东解释你为什么在这里，为什么在这里创造就业机会。所以这是另一个考虑因素。所以，真正拥有一个安全的城市和一个负担得起的城市是首要标准，至少在拥有一个负担得起的城市方面，他们与Zohran的竞选活动有共同之处。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, absolutely. Because the whole basis of business being here is the talent pool. And if talent doesn't want to be here, if they're scared to leave be in New York City, if they're worried to go on the subway because they might get mugged or pushed in front of a train, that's the worst thing that could happen to New York. So, and and importantly, Zoran has acknowledged that keeping New York a destination for talent is a priority for him. So, I think that message is is very important. So that that public safety number one and then as I said before affordable housing and affordability that again allows talent to be here and doesn't have a premium cost. I mean already in most sectors New York City salaries have a 20% premium at least over if you're going to locate in Texas or Florida whatever. when it gets higher than that, it becomes hard to explain to shareholders why you're here and why you're creating jobs here. So that's the that's the other consideration. So it's it's really having a safe city and having an affordable city are the top criteria and at least in terms of having an affordable city, they've got common cause with uh Zoran's campaign.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 这正是我要问您的。Zohran的议程与商界的担忧或愿望之间是否存在任何重叠或一致的领域？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is what I was going to ask you. Are there any areas of I guess overlap or agreement between Zoran's agenda and the concerns or the desires of the business community?</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 是的，绝对有。正如我提到的，下周可能会提出的一个大问题，也许是第一个问题，就是“你对公共安全的承诺是什么？”你知道，象征性地，你会让Jesse Tisch继续担任警察局长吗？如果他要削减警察经费，她肯定不会留任，因为她正在寻求更多的警力、更多的资源，以确保我们仍然是美国乃至世界上最安全的城市。所以这将是公共安全问题。然后在可负担性方面，希望他们能够沟通，仅仅增加市政府预算并不能提高可负担性。我们必须比这更有创意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, absolutely. As I mentioned, one of the big questions that'll come up next week, probably the first question that'll come up is what is your commitment to public safety? You know, symbolically, would you keep Jesse Tish as police commissioner? and she certainly won't stay if he's going to defund the police because she's looking for more officers, more resources to really make sure that we stay the safest city in America and the world hopefully. So that'll be public safety. And then on affordability, it'll be hoping that they can communicate that just having city government increase its budget does not improve affordability. We've got to be more creative than that.</p>
</details>

### 住房可负担性的深层制约

**Tracy Alloway:** 您认为影响可负担性的主要制约因素是什么？从您的角度看，他们花了多少年时间才就伊丽莎白街花园（Elizabeth Street Garden）建造一些房屋进行辩论？这个过程似乎永无止境，我知道这是世界上最热门的话题，但从广义上讲，您认为降低纽约市租金的主要制约因素是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What do you see as the main constraints to affordability? What do you from your just from your perspective, how many years did they were they debating about putting up some houses at the Elizabeth Street Garden? like these the process take forever, but like I know that's like the most hot button topic in the world, but just broadly, what do you perceive as the main constraint towards making rent cheaper in New York City?</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 在租金管制建筑中，租金的30%是房地产税。所以，依赖房地产税的政府支出，这是城市收入的主要来源，正在推高租金。并不是说这些老旧租金管制建筑的开发商赚取了巨额利润。而是他们的成本上升了。他们的水费等等。所有这些都与水和下水道有关。这些都在城市的控制之下。所以政府可以非常迅速地采取措施来降低成本，举个例子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">30% of rent is real estate taxes in rent regulated buildings. So, government spending that depends on real estate taxes, that's where the majority of the city revenues come from, is driving high rents. Uh it's not that developers in these older rent regulated buildings are making a huge profit. It's that their costs have gone up. Their water bills etc. All these are on water and sewer. These are under control of the city. So there are things government can do very quickly to reduce costs as an example.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 那么住房生产的纯粹数量呢？因为归根结底，大多数人会觉得租金非常昂贵。它也很稀缺，这导致租金价格上涨，房东可以收取高额租金。您认为是否有有意义的杠杆可以迅速提高我们建造经济适用房或市场价住房等的速度？您会指出什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What about just sheer volume of housing production? Because right in the end like most people okay rent is very expensive. It's also scarce and that contributes to the fact that rent prices go up and that landlords can yeah collect a lot of rent. Do you think there are meaningful levers that could be pulled to rapidly increase the pace in which we build whether it's affordable housing or market rate housing etc. Like what would you identify?</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 绝对有。再次强调，是减少政府官僚主义。我现在是**城市宪章修订委员会**（City Charter Revision Commission: 负责审查和修改城市宪章的机构）的成员，该委员会将在11月向公众提交决议，以研究如何削减与开发审批相关的时间和成本，特别是对于小型项目。我想提到的另一件事是，它非常影响建筑成本，但也影响所有其他成本，那就是通过高昂的保险费用转嫁给消费者的诉讼成本。我们有最高的索赔和和解金额。我们是全国诉讼程度最高的地区。几乎不可能通过任何不包括**私人诉讼权**（private right of action: 允许私人个体或实体在法庭上起诉违反法律的行为）的立法。**审判律师**（trial lawyers: 专门从事法庭诉讼的律师）是奥尔巴尼（纽约州首府）最有影响力的游说团体。他们在城市内部也有很大的影响力，我们必须降低我们的诉讼成本。我们的保险成本比全国其他任何地方都高得多。我们的汽车保险成本比全国平均水平高出49%。我们的医疗保险成本高出12%。所有这些成本我们绝对可以控制和管理。而城市，基本上是自保的，最终要自掏腰包支付这些费用。所以他们每年在医疗事故和其他方面支付数十亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely. Again, it's reducing government bureaucracy. Right now I'm on the city charter revision commission which is going to put resolutions before the public I believe in November to look at how we can cut down on the time and cost associated with development approvals especially for smaller projects. The other thing I want to mention that affects the cost of construction very much but also it affects all other costs is the cost of litigation passed along to consumers through high insurance costs. We have the highest claims and settlements. We have the highest degree of litigation in the country. It's almost impossible to get anything through the legislature that doesn't include a private right of action. The trial lawyers are the strongest lobby in Albany. also have a lot of influence within the city and we have to get down our litigation costs. Our insurance costs are substantially higher than anywhere else in the country. Our car insurance costs are 49% higher than the average in the country. Our health insurance costs are 12% higher. These are all costs that we could absolutely contain and control. And the city, which is basically self-insured, ends up paying this out of pocket. So they pay billions of dollars a year in medical malpractice in other</p>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 可以资助很多免费公交。

**Kathy Wild:** 那会资助很多免费公交。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that would fund a lot of free buses.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 难道更高的诉讼成本不只是反映了更高的生活成本和材料成本等等吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Aren't the higher litigation costs aren't they just a reflection of I guess the higher cost of living and materials maybe and things like that</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 它们反映了一个系统，在这个系统中，我们的陪审团裁决远高于其他任何地方。他们称之为“**核裁决**”（nuclear awards: 指数额极高的陪审团裁决）。不，这完全是因为法律。我们在奥尔巴尼的法律中有一条，它是劳工法的一部分。它是在一百年前通过的，当时我们还没有工人赔偿和其他对建筑工人的保护措施。如果你有与重力相关的伤害，其中许多是虚构的，仅仅这一条法律就可以使建筑成本增加5%到7%。所以当我们问为什么在纽约建造一套两居室的出租公寓要花费一百万美元时，当你仔细观察，你会发现其中很大一部分是诉讼保险成本和完成任何事情所需的时间，以及这段时间内的持有成本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">they're they're a reflection of a system where our jury awards are much higher than any place else. They call them nuclear awards. Uh no it's all because of laws. We have one law on the books in Albany. It's part of the labor law. It was passed a hundred years ago and it was passed before we had workers compensation and other protections for construction workers. If you have a gravity related injury and many of these are staged, that one law can add 5 to 7% to the cost of construction just that one law. And so when we say why why does it cost a million dollars to produce a two-bedroom rental apartment in New York to build it? When you look at it, you'll see that a big chunk of that is the result of the litigation insurance costs and the time that it takes to get anything done, the carrying costs for the time.</p>
</details>

### 慈善事业与亿万富翁的社会参与

**Joe Weisenthal:** 鉴于您作为富人“治疗师”的角色，我想问一个社会问题。我有时觉得，很多人可能认为现在的亿万富翁不如以前那么乐善好施了。当然，这要追溯到本世纪初，我想到像您认识或曾合作过的Rockefeller，他在1970年代拯救了这座城市，那是一个他决定花钱拯救纽约并为纽约未来做出贡献的行为。这是否准确地描绘了现在的亿万富翁？他们是否较少参与整体社会？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to ask a sort of social question given your role as therapist to uh the wealthy, but I get a sense sometimes that there is a feeling out there among maybe a lot of people that billionaires are less charitable than they once were. certainly going back to earlier in the century perhaps and I think back to like Rockefeller who you know or knew um and worked with and him bailing out the city in the 1970s like that was an act where he decided I am going to spend money in order to save New York and contribute to New York's future. Is that an accurate portrayal of billionaires nowadays? Are they less engaged in overall society?</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 嗯，在很多情况下，家族财富，比如Rockefeller家族的财富，已经多元化了。所以你没有一个人像以前那么富有。财富分散了。但对纽约、对它的医院、博物馆、大学、机构的承诺依然存在。我们是世界上慈善事业最发达的城市。我接待来自世界各地的访客，来自巴黎、伦敦、洛杉矶、旧金山，他们都说：“纽约是如何创造出一种如此乐善好施、如此慷慨的文化？”Rockefeller家族、Aers家族以及许多纽约的关键家族确实为此做出了贡献。但你也会看到对几周前去世的**Leonard Lauder**（美国商人、慈善家，雅诗兰黛公司前董事长）的悼念，这些悼念来自每一个非营利机构。纽约人的慷慨是巨大的。“亿万富翁”这个标签通常附在那些自我宣传为亿万富翁的人身上。我会对此进行区分。我所谈论的这些人，没有一个想被称为或宣称自己是亿万富翁，也没有一个想把自己定位为亿万富翁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, in many cases, the family wealth, like in the Rockefeller family, has diversified. So, you don't have one person who is as wealthy. It's spread out. But the commitment to New York, to its hospitals, its museums, its universities, its institutions. We have by far the most philanthropic city in the world. I get visitors from all over the world, from Paris, from London, from LA, from San Francisco, all of whom say, "How does New York create a culture which is so giving, which is so generous?" And the Rockefellers and the Aers and many of the families that, you know, the key families of New York did contribute to this. But then you saw the tributes to Leonard Lauder who died a few weeks ago. They were all for from every nonprofit institution. The generosity of New Yorkers is huge. The label billionaire is often attached to self-promoters who are promoting themselves as billionaires. I would distinguish that. None of the people that I'm talking about want to be known or proclaim themselves or position themselves as billionaires.</p>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 对。

### 代际差异与全球化焦点

**Tracy Alloway:** 是的，这确实引起了共鸣。我想回到一个问题。您提到了纽约市犹太社区的代际鸿沟，以及40岁以下的人群可能对纽约市与以色列国的关系有非常不同的看法。您还提到，您合作的许多人直到选举之夜晚上10点才意识到社会主义者可能成为民主党提名人，这让我好奇他们到底有多么投入，因为至少在选举前一个月，对我来说，Mamdani获胜的可能性已经非常明显了。是否存在一种持续存在的代际意识问题？我还在思考可负担性、住房以及其他一些问题，我不想说他们脱节，但我想说的是，商界精英、首席执行官们等等，与年轻选民在各种问题上的想法之间存在脱节。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. That definitely resonates. I want to go back to something. You know, you mentioned the generational divide among New York City's Jewish community and the idea that the under 40 crowd may have a very different perception of the relationship that New York City should have about the state of Israel or state of Israel period. And you also mentioned that, you know, for many of the people that you work with, it only dawned on them that a socialist could be the uh Democratic nominee at 10 p.m. on election night, which makes me wonder like how plugged they are in because certainly in at least the month prior to the election, it became very obvious to me that this was like a very real possibility that he could win. Like is there a persistent problem of sort of like generational awareness? And I'm thinking also about affordability and housing and some of these other issues where I don't want to say like out of touch, but I guess out of touch between the business elites, the CEOs, etc., and what's on the mind of younger voters, period, across a range of issues.</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 我认为这是一个非常中肯的评论。大多数成熟的商界人士并不生活在社交媒体上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that's a a very fair comment. Most of the mature business world is not living on social media.</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 嗯，他们没有接入那个世界。这是造成代际鸿沟的一个重要因素。我的意思是，我仍然读报纸，真正的报纸，这是一种区别。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, they're not they're not plugged into that world. And that's that's a great contributor to the generational divide. I mean, I still read a paper, a real paper, and that's that's a differentiator.</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 另一件事是，经济的全球化意味着纽约是世界工业领导力的中心，他们专注于全球旅行，把大部分时间花在世界各地。所以，我们是所有这些不同领域，如时尚、媒体等，的总部城市，这意味着焦点是全球性的，而不是地方性的。尤其是在政治上，焦点是华盛顿，那里是大多数监管活动的发源地，而不是地方。与华盛顿相比，市和州只是次要的。所以，这只是我们过去50年经济变化性质的体现，它从50年前的地方工业经济，变成了服务经济，再到今天的全球数字经济。所有这些都意味着商业领导层的注意力主要集中在外部，关注全球商业世界市场和华盛顿。一天只有那么多时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the other thing is that the globalization of the economy has meant I mean New York is a center of world industry leadership and they are focused and spending their life traveling all over the world. So the fact that we're a headquarters city in all these diverse sectors in fashion, in media, in means that the focus is global rather than local. Politically especially the focus is Washington, which is where most of the regulatory activity is coming from, not local. City and state are sidelines compared. So, it's just the nature of our changing economy over the last 50 years, which has gone from being a local 50 years ago industrial economy to being a service economy to today being a global digital economy. And all of that means that the attention of business leadership has been largely externally focused on the world business world markets and on Washington that just there's only so many hours in a day. Mhm.</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 我的意思是，我们在伙伴关系组织努力做的就是为那些全球领导者综合本地发生的事情，以及谁是谁，什么是什么。这就是我们现在在市长选举方面所做的工作。我们试图在他们认真对待并必须优先考虑的时候，让他们参与到对话中。但这些人正在经营全球业务，这就是改变的地方。不是其他任何东西，而是注意力的焦点必须是全球性的。我只想提一下，因为我们坐在这里的Bloomberg播客世界，Mike Bloomberg在担任市长时改变了这一点，他将我们全球领导者的注意力重新带回了纽约，这非常有用。我是在2000年，也就是Mike当选前，2001年之前开始担任伙伴关系组织的首席执行官的。我利用这个机会重新吸引了你们。如果你去纽约参加一个有Mike Bloomberg参加的鸡尾酒会，你就必须谈论纽约。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, what we try and do at the partnership is synthesize for those global leaders what's happening locally and who's who and what's what. That's what we're doing with regard to the mayoral election now. It's trying to bring them into the conversation at a point where they're taking it seriously and they have to prioritize it. But these are these are people who are running global businesses and that's the that's what's changed. It's not anything else but the focus of attention has to be global and well I I would just mention because we sit here in Bloomberg podcast world that u Mike Bloomberg changed that when he was mayor he brought the attention of our global leaders back to New York which was extremely useful. I started as CEO of the partnership in uh 2000, right before 2001, before Mike was elected. And I took advantage of re-engaging you. If you went to a cocktail party in New York that Mike Bloomberg is going to be at, you had to talk New York.</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 他是一位思想领袖。他是一位领先的慈善家。当人们问我谁取代了David Rockefeller成为这座城市领先的慈善家时，答案是Mike Bloomberg。很简单。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And he was a thought leader. He was the leading philanthropist. When people ask me who replaced David Rockefeller as the leading philanthropist in the city was Mike Bloomberg. Simple.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我必须在这里做一个免责声明，当然，**彭博新闻社**（Bloomberg News）、**彭博媒体**（Bloomberg Media）是**彭博有限合伙企业**（Bloomberg LP）的一部分，而彭博有限合伙企业由Mike Bloomberg所有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have to do the disclaimer here which is of course Bloomberg News. Bloomberg Media is part of Bloomberg LP which is owned by Mike Bloomberg. So</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 我们没有告诉我们的嘉宾把我们的老板描述成新的David Rockefeller。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we didn't tell our guest to describe our boss as the uh the new David Rockefeller.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 不，我们没有。嗯，我只有一个……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, we did not. Um I I just have one</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 这不是我第一次说了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This isn't the first time I've said it.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 好的，好的。我只有一个问题，那就是您是否注意到或看到商界有任何反思的时刻，比如“哦，也许我们错过了Zohran的一些东西，也许我们错过了他为什么在城市中引起如此大共鸣的原因，也许我们应该开始做一些不同的事情，也许我们需要建造更多的住房或降低租金等等”，或者他们仍然非常致力于维持现状，或者说是Eric Adams的现状，他们希望他获胜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Okay. All right. I just have one more question which is have you noticed or seen at all I guess moments of introspection among the business community this idea that like oh maybe we missed something about Zoran maybe we missed why he's resonating so much in the city maybe we should start doing something different maybe we need to you know actually build more housing or lower rents or whatever or are they still committed very much to uh this not the status quo but the Eric Adams status quo and they want him to win.</p>
</details>

### 总结：商界的反思与Mamdani的沟通

**Kathy Wild:** 再次区分一下房地产界，他们看到了对私人开发的**生存威胁**（existential threat: 对某个实体或系统的基本存在构成严重风险的威胁）的可能性。抛开这一点，就普通商界而言，我认为您的观点是他们觉得自己与实际情况有点脱节，他们想融入其中。他们真的很有兴趣。我的意思是，我们对会见Zohran、与他交谈表现出了极大的兴趣。他给一些企业打了电话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, distinguishing between the real estate community that sees the potential of an existential threat to private development. Putting that aside in terms of the general business community, I think your point that they're feeling a little out of touch with uh what's been happening on the ground and they want to plug in. They are really interested. I mean, we've had tremendous interest in meeting Zoron, speaking with him. He's made calls to some businesses.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的。在那些电话之后他们说了什么？因为您提到了即将举行的会议，但有些人已经聊过了。他们的反应是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. What do they say after like the after those phone calls? Because the they've, you know, you mentioned the meetings that are coming up, but some have already they've already chatted. Like what is what what is their response?</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 他们的反应是，他是一个“一代政治家”。我的意思是，他是一个具有时代意义的人物。他们印象深刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Their response is that he is um you know, they said he's the politician of a generation. I mean, he's a generational figure. They're they're impressed.</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 在与他进行了10分钟的电话交谈后，因为他是一个非常有效的沟通者，而且他会倾听。你知道，商界领袖喜欢被倾听。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, after a 10-minute phone call with him because he is he's a very effective communicator and he listens. And, you know, business leaders like to be listened to.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** Kathy Wild，太棒了。很高兴我们促成了这次对话。正如我所说，也许我们会在某个时候再次邀请您，或者很乐意在某个时候再次邀请您。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kathy Wild, that was fantastic. So glad we made this happen. And uh, like I said, maybe we'll maybe we'll have you back at some point or would love to have you back on at some point.</p>
</details>

**Kathy Wild:** 谢谢。很高兴来到这里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you. Nice to be here.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** Tracy，我真的很喜欢那次对话。有很多值得深思的地方。这个想法，有很多事情。这个想法是，纽约市的首席执行官们，仅仅因为经济变化的性质，他们自己对纽约市的关注度就降低了，这对我来说是以前从未真正考虑过但很有道理的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tracy, I really like that conversation. There was a lot to pull from. This idea, there are a number of things. this idea that the CEOs who are headquartered here in New York City just by the nature of the changing economy are less New York City focused themselves to me is like something I hadn't really thought about but makes a lot of sense to me.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的，我觉得那真的很有趣。Kathy提出的另一个有趣观点是，华尔街的首席执行官们和其他企业与房地产行业之间的分歧，房地产行业似乎对Mamdani市长的前景感到非常恐慌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I thought that was really interesting. The other interesting point that Kathy brought up was, I guess, the divergence between, you know, Wall Street CEOs and perhaps other businesses versus real estate, which really seems to be freaking out about the prospects of a Mumani mayorship.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 是的。不，那真的很有趣。这个想法不是铁板一块。我在开场白中说过，或者很早就说过。你知道，我认为很多人在纸面上，他们会说：“哦，你看看他的政策清单，也许不是他们太感兴趣的东西，但事实是他们并不觉得他有威胁，或者他们并不觉得他令人反感。”所以，他已经进行了这些对话，这令人惊讶。同样令人惊讶的是，你知道，人们认为他可能是一个极端意识形态的人，但从他竞选一开始的九月，他就联系了Kathy，并建立了这些联系。我的意思是，这是一场非常精明的竞选。嗯，关于这一点，另一件事是，首先，我真的很着迷于这是否会开始改变竞选资金及其运作方式，因为Cuomo拥有所有的钱，但投资回报率却很糟糕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. No, that's really interesting. This idea that it's uh not monolithic. I said it in the intro or I said it early on. You know, I think a lot of people who are on paper, they're like, "Oh, you look down the list of his policies, maybe not something that they're too into, but the fact that they don't like find him to be threatening or they don't find him to be repellent in some way." And so it's striking that already he's having these conversations. Also like it is just striking to me that you know people see him as you know potentially this extremely ideological person and yet from the very beginning of his campaign in September was reaching out to Kathy and like making these connection. I mean it's a it was a really savvy campaign. Well, the other thing on that note, first of all, I'm really fascinated to see whether or not this starts to change campaign finance and the way it works because again, Quuomo had all the money and terrible ROI.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的，没错。我真正感兴趣的另一件事是，商界，Kathy说，他们最关心的问题之一是吸引人才进入城市。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, exactly. And the other thing I'm really interested in is okay, the business community, Kathy was saying one of their primary concerns is attracting talent into the city.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 嗯，你知道，这些人才中，大部分可能是年轻人。其中可能有一大部分是进步派的。是的。所以像Zohran这样的候选人可能会吸引他们，并真正吸引更多人来到这座城市。所以，这同样有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, you know, that talent presumably a lot of it is young. There's probably a large portion in there that is, you know, of a progressive event. Yeah. And so a candidate like Zoran might appeal to them and actually bring more people into the city. So it's also interesting.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我的意思是，安全和犯罪问题是头等大事，对吧，那会让人离开，因为……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean the safety and crime thing is the number one thing, right, that would cause people to leave because</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 再次强调，谈论离开纽约市的人比实际离开的人多得多。确实，我认为很多在疫情后时期以为会搬到迈阿密的人，出于显而易见的原因都回来了。但有趣的是，甚至不是任何经济方面的问题。不是社会主义的问题。只是基本的安全问题。我知道有很多关于Mamdani如果获胜是否会保留警察局长的问题。近年来犯罪统计数据已经有了很大的改善。这个想法是，这才是真正的大问题，而不是租金冻结或税收或其他任何事情，我认为这对于Mamdani来说将是一个有趣的行政问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and again there's a lot more talk about leaving New York City than there is actually leaving New York City. And it is true that I think a lot of those people who thought they were going to decamp to Miami during the post-pandemic period have come back for obvious uh for obvious reasons. But it's interesting that it's not even like any of the economic stuff. It's not the uh socialism stuff. It's just the basic safety stuff. And there is I know there's a lot of the question about whether Mani if he wins will keep the police commissioner. The crime stats have improved quite a bit in recent years. the idea that this is like the really big thing more than you know the rent freeze or taxes or anything else I think is just going to be an interesting um executive question for uh Mumani.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 这次选举带来了许多有趣的问题。我们暂时就到这里吧？
