### 会议的普遍困境与专家见解

**主持人：** 今天，我们将讨论一个非常有趣的话题——会议。我们有很多会议吗？可能每天仅在美国就有超过一亿场会议。其中许多会议很棒，但也有很多效果不佳。今天我们将讨论如何改进它们。我们请来了世界顶尖专家Steven Rogelberg，热烈欢迎。

<p class="english-text">today we're going to talk about something really interesting meetings now G do we have a lot of meetings probably we have more than 100 million meetings every day just in the US um many of them are great many of them are not very good and we're going to talk about that today how to improve them we have the world leading specialist Stephen rogelberg warm welcome.</p>
</details>

**Steven Rogelberg：** 很高兴来到这里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">oh it's so good to be here.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 您来奥斯陆参加这次会议，是吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">great and you're coming to Oslo to have this meeting I am.</p>
</details>

**Steven Rogelberg：** 是的，这是我一直想参加的会议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I am and this is the this is a meeting I wanted to have.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 很好。您是如何对会议产生兴趣的呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that's good now how come you became interested in this?</p>
</details>

**Steven Rogelberg：** 天哪，我也不知道，除了纯粹的挫败感——每天都被会议填满，却感觉一事无成。我担心的是，这种感觉是否在数百万工作者中普遍存在？答案是肯定的。当你的日子被会议塞满时，一天结束时你会感到更加疲惫，觉得还有更多工作要做，却没有成就感。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">oh my my gosh I have no idea other than just the sheer frustration of having a day filled with meetings and not feeling like I accomplished anything and my concern was is that a shared feeling amongst the millions and millions of people out there working and the answer is yes when you have days full of meetings you just end that day feeling more drained feeling like you have yet more work to do and yet you don't have that sense of accomplishment.</p>
</details>

### 成功会议的关键：意向性与管家心态

**主持人：** 那么，成功会议的关键是什么？因为有些会议确实很成功，对吧？有时我们开完会会说“哇，那真不错”。成功的关键是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what's what's the key to a successful meeting because some of them are successful right sometimes we come out on meeting and said wow that was good what's the key to that?</p>
</details>

**Steven Rogelberg：** 成功的关键有很多，它始于**意向性**（intentionality）。我们的研究发现，最优秀的会议领导者有一个共同点：他们都抱持着成为他人时间的好**管家**（Steward: 负责管理他人资源的人）的心态。当你将自己视为他人时间的管家时，你就会有意识地做出会议选择，有意识地设计、主持和结束会议。有趣的是，我们在与重要利益相关者开会时，总是会持有这种**管家心态**，但与团队或同事开会时，我们往往会退缩，不再像个管家。我确信我们会在具体选择方面讨论一些意向性，但这无疑始于这样一种心态：如果人们离开你的会议时说那是浪费时间，你会感到非常不舒服，从而会努力采取措施避免这种情况发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so there's a there's a host of keys um it starts with intentionality so what we have found in our research is the best meeting leaders have something in common and what they have in common is the mindset of being a good Steward of others time and when you think of yourself as a steward of others time you become intentional with your meeting choices you design the meeting with intentionality you facilitate the meeting with intentionality and you close the meeting with intentionality and interestingly we always we have have this stewardship mindset when we're meeting with critical stakeholders but we when we're meeting with our team or peers we tend to step back and not act like a steward so we will talk about some of that intentionality I'm sure in terms of specific choices but it definitely starts with this mindset that if people leave your meeting saying that it was a waste of time that is so uncomfortable to you that you try to do things to prevented.</p>
</details>

### 何时召开会议：目的、习惯与替代方案

**主持人：** 我们首先应该在什么时候召开会议？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when should we call a meeting in the first place?</p>
</details>

**Steven Rogelberg：** 会议应该在有**明确目的**且需要互动和参与时召开。如果不需要互动和参与，那么就不需要把大家召集在一起。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">meeting should be called when there's a compelling purpose that that requires interaction and engagement if you don't need interaction and engagement then you don't need to bring people together right.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 我们应该定期安排会议吗？比如每周一都开会？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">this should we have them regularly in the in the diary should we just have them every Monday bang bang meet this person?</p>
</details>

**Steven Rogelberg：** 如果有充分的理由，当然可以。但我们不应该仅仅因为习惯而开会，现在很多日程表都被习惯性会议填满了。习惯很难打破，所以我们必须更加深思熟虑，只在绝对必要时才安排会议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">if there's a compelling reason to do that but we just don't want to meet out of habit which is what calendars are being filled with right it's just habits and habits are tough to break so we definitely want to be more thoughtful that we only schedule a meeting when there's is absolute criticality to do so.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 那我们什么时候应该只发邮件呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when should we just send an email instead?</p>
</details>

**Steven Rogelberg：** 让我来解释一下，因为有些邮件可能应该变成会议，而有些会议则应该变成邮件。我认为这始终归结为**内容是否需要互动**。如果内容需要互动，会议就是完美的机制。让我分享一个技巧，这与议程的制定有关。我们都知道制定议程的重要性，但我有一个不同的议程方法，它能告诉你何时应该开会，何时不应该。与其将议程设定为一系列要讨论的话题，我建议大家将议程设定为一系列要回答的**问题**。通过将议程设定为要回答的问题，你必须退一步，真正思考：我为什么要开这个会？是为了解决这些问题。通过以问题形式制定议程，你能更好地确定谁必须参加会议，因为他们与这些问题相关。通过以问题形式制定议程，你现在就能知道会议是否成功——问题是否得到了回答。如果你根本想不出任何问题，那很可能意味着你不需要开会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so let me give you because some emails should probably be meetings and some meetings should be emails I think it keeps going back to that the need for engagement with the content that really is what if you need engagement with the content meetings are a perfect mechanism so let me give you a technique let me tie this to a technique and we all know the importance of creating an agenda well I have an alternative approach to agendas and it speaks to when you should have a meeting and when you should not so instead of framing your agenda as a set of topics to be discussed what I want to challenge folks to do is create an agenda as a set of questions to be answered by Framing your agenda as a set of questions to be answered now you have to step back and really think why am I having this meeting it's to address these questions by Framing your agenda as questions you have a better sense of who has to be there they're relevant to the questions by Framing your agenda's questions you now know if the meeting has been successful the questions have been answered and if you just can't think of any questions it likely means you don't need a meeting absolutely.</p>
</details>

### 深入理解“管家心态”与参会人员选择

**主持人：** 您提到了“管家心态”，对吗？这具体指什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">no you have something called a stur mindset right what what what is involved in that?</p>
</details>

**Steven Rogelberg：** 这是一种理念，即你邀请人们来开会，是请求他们给予我们所有人最宝贵的礼物——他们的时间。既然请求了，你就要珍惜这段时间，确保这份投入对他们和你都有意义。所以，当你拥有这种**管家心态**时，你就会努力做出明智的选择，带着意向性来提升会议时间，让人们在会议结束时感觉这不是一种消耗，而是一种收获。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so that is just this this notion that you are inviting people you are asking people to give you the greatest gift that we all have our time and by asking for that you want to honor that time you want to make sure that that investment is Meaningful to them and to you so when you have that stewardship mindset you are trying to create good choices that intentionality to elevate this meeting time so that people feel at the end that it wasn't a drain but instead a gain.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 谁应该参加会议？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">who should be in a meeting?</p>
</details>

**Steven Rogelberg：** 应该参加会议的人，是对回答相关问题至关重要的人。我想在疫情期间，当我们在使用团队协作工具时，我们倾向于把所有人都拉进来，生怕冒犯了谁。没错，没有人应该感到被排斥，每个人都应该参与。我认为我们只是延续了这种理念。这种增加会议规模的愿望源于三种力量：第一种是**善意**，你只是想把人们都包括进来，所以你邀请了他们，这是出于好意。第二种是**懒惰**，我们很容易就能占用人们的日程表，邀请他们参加会议。所以我们没有深思熟虑，只是抱着“有疑问就邀请”的心态。第三种是**不安全感**，即随着人们越来越多地远程工作，领导者对他们是否真正在管理缺乏信心。他们如何表达自己的管理呢？就是把人们召集到会议中。因此，这些会议的规模不断扩大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the people that should be in the meeting are critical to answering the questions of interest because during I think during covid when we were at teams we kind of included everybody left right and Center in order not to offend anybody that's right nobody should feel excluded everybody should be part of it you know meeting and and I think we just kind of continued that philosophy exactly this so This desire to increase meeting size comes from three forces the first force is a force of goodness you just want to include people so you invite them right that's a coming from a good place the second force is laziness right it's very easy for us just to hold captive people's calendars and invite them to a meeting right so we're not thoughtful or deliberate we just say when in doubt invite the third force is insecurity namely as people became working more remote leaders just didn't have that confidence that they were actually managing so how do they express their management you bring them into a meeting and so these meetings just keep increasing increasing in size.</p>
</details>

### 会议的最佳规模与时长：帕金森定律的应用

**主持人：** 会议的最佳规模是多少？有没有最大人数限制？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what's the optimal is there um like a Max size of a meeting?</p>
</details>

**Steven Rogelberg：** 这取决于你是否想实现真正的互动。如果你真的想创造互动，那么超过八个人就非常困难了，你需要一个非常熟练的引导者。会议应该持续多久？会议应该根据你想要回答的问题，持续绝对必要的时间。但它们往往会填满所有分配的时间。没错，这就是**帕金森定律**（Parkinson's Law: 指工作会膨胀以填满所有可用的时间）的原理。一个安排了60分钟的会议就会占用60分钟。但我们实际上可以利用这个科学原理。如果我们把会议安排成25或55分钟，我们就能完成它。事实上，研究表明，如果你确定一个会议时间，然后将其缩短大约五分钟，它实际上会产生积极的压力和更高的专注度，这些团队的表现会更好。这很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it it depends if you're trying to accomplish genuine interaction if you really want to create interaction you know more than eight people is super hard you have to be a very skilled facilitator yeah how long should they be they should be as long as absolutely necessary given what you're trying to answer but they tend to fill up the time they have exactly so there's something called Parkinson's law and Parkinson's law is the idea that work expands to fill whatever time is allotted to it so a meeting scheduled for 60 minutes will take 60 minutes but we can actually use that science to our advantage if we schedule a meeting for 25 5 minutes we will get it done in fact the research shows that if you identify a meeting time and then decrease it by around five minutes it actually creates positive pressure and more focus and those groups perform better that's interesting.</p>
</details>

### 提升会议吸引力：领导者的角色与积极倾听

**主持人：** 那么，如何让会议变得更好，更具吸引力呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now how do you make meetings good how do you make them engagement engaging?</p>
</details>

**Steven Rogelberg：** 这始于议程和意向性，即以问题为导向的方法。当你将议程设定为要回答的问题时，人们就会被吸引进来。我们从小学生时代起就习惯于回答问题。所以，当我们以问题形式设定议程，并且当领导者开始会议时，科学研究中一个非常有趣的发现是，**领导者的情绪实际上是会议情绪的最佳预测指标**。如果你带着消极的情绪状态进入会议，它会弥漫整个会议，影响参与度和对新想法的开放性。所以会议必须有一个好的开始，领导者必须认识到他们是主持人，是他们召集了所有人。那么主持人会做什么呢？主持人会欢迎大家，做介绍，表达感谢，并帮助人们从会议前所做的事情中抽离出来，进入会议本身。一旦会议开始，领导者就是引导者。如果你邀请某人参加会议，那是因为你想听听他们的想法。所以领导者会积极参与，并说：“戈登，我还没听过你的想法，我很想听听你对此的看法”，或者“桑迪，我知道你正在做类似的事情”。他们会帮助大家表达意见，鼓励**思想冲突**，而不是人际冲突。然后，当会议接近尾声时，他们会帮助推动会议的结束。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I it starts from that agenda and that intentionality so that questions based approach when you frame your agenda as questions to be answered people will be drawn into it right we as early as young school kids we are drawn to answer questions so when we frame it as questions and then when the leader starts the meeting what was so interesting in the science is that the leader's mood is actually the best predictor of the meetings mood so if you come in there in a negative mood state it pervades the meeting and it affects engagement and openness to new ideas so the meeting has to start well the leader has to recognize that they are a host they called everyone together so what does a host do a host welcomes people a host makes introductions a host expresses gratitude and helps people make separation from what they were doing before they walked into the meeting and then into the meeting itself and then once that meeting is going that leader is facilitating right if you invited someone to this meeting it's because you wanted to hear what they had to say so that leader is dialed in and saying oh I haven't heard from you Gordon I'd love to hear your thoughts on this or or Sandy I know you were working on something similar right so they're helping bring the voices out they're encouraging conflict conflict of ideas right so they're they're doing all that and then when the meeting is coming to a conclusion they help promote an ending.</p>
</details>

**Steven Rogelberg：** 常见的情况是，级别最高的人发言最多，不幸的是，确实如此。普遍发现，这些发言最多的高级人员并没有察觉到会议的动态。当你讲很多话时，你会很享受，觉得这很棒。人们发言越多，他们对会议体验的感觉就越好。所以这些领导者，你级别越高，从听到自己声音中获得的**内啡肽**越多。没错，所以他们离开会议时会说“这很棒”，但其他人却不这么认为。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the common thing is that the most senior person speaks the most right unfortunately that is and what has generally been found is these most senior folks who talk the most they are not picking up on the meeting Dynamics when you do a lot of talking you love it you think this is great the more people talk the better they feel about the experience so these leaders and the more senior you are the more endorphins you get from hearing your own voice exactly so they leave the meeting saying this was great but everyone else doesn't feel the same.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 如何培养良好的倾听能力？谁是好的倾听者？有时你发表演讲或研讨会，会发现听众中有些人就是更好的倾听者，你一眼就能看出来，我想这与他们的点头方式有关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how do you get um what's good listening who's a good listener I think it's interesting sometimes you give speech or a seminar or something and you some people in the audience are just better listeners and you can just see it I think it's the way they're notd I guess uh.</p>
</details>

**Steven Rogelberg：** 倾听有多个组成部分。让我通过一个相关的科学发现来回答这个问题。你有没有注意到，当人们做自我介绍时，你记住了他们的名字，但很快就忘了？当然。对此有过研究，基本上我们记不住名字的主要原因有几个。首先，我们并不真正关心。所以这给了我们一个关于倾听的关键线索：**关心对方所说的话**。我们经常忘记名字的第二个原因是，当对方介绍自己时，我们正在排练自己要说的话。所以，**积极倾听**（active listening）就是全身心地投入，真正关心对方所说的一切，将其视为一个挑战，全身心地投入到对方的话语中。因此，像“请帮我理解”、“多告诉我一些”、“你有什么想法”这类表达，都是真正与他人内容互动的明显尝试，这就是倾听发挥作用的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so listening has multiple components um so let me answer that question by telling by telling you a related piece of science which I think speaks to it have you noticed that when people make introductions you learn someone's name next thing you know you've forgotten it sure and so there were studies to look at this and basically one of the principal reasons well there's a couple principal reasons we don't remember the names is one we don't really care we don't really care so that now tells us one key clue to listening is caring what that person says Y the second reason we often forget the names is because we are rehearsing what we're going to say while that person's introducing themselves so active listening is all about caring truly engaging with what that person has to say say taking as a challenge to truly fully engage with their words so the the types of utterance such as help me understand tell me more what are your thoughts right these are all overt attempts to truly engage with another person's content and that's where listening takes part.</p>
</details>

### 鼓励思想冲突：皮克斯的启示与沉默的力量

**主持人：** 您提到了会议中冲突的重要性。我们曾邀请皮克斯（Pixar）的创始人**Ed Catmull**做客播客，他谈到了史蒂夫·乔布斯（Steve Jobs）。他们共同创立了皮克斯，史蒂夫·乔布斯曾解雇了两名皮克斯董事会成员，因为他们在会议中从未与他意见相左。他说，如果你不提出异议，你就没有为公司增加任何价值。那么，如何创造一个人们可以放心地提出异议的环境呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you mentioned the important of um kind of conflicts in meetings um so we had um Ed KML who was the founder of Pixar on on the podcast and he talked about Steve Jobs I mean they they co-founded pixa together Steve Jobs he he sacked two board members at Pixar because they never disagreed with him in in meetings and he said you know if you don't disagree you're not adding anything to this company so how do you create an environment where people are feel okay to disagree?</p>
</details>

**Steven Rogelberg：** 这很棒。我们当然希望会议中出现冲突，但我们希望是**思想上的冲突，而不是人际上的冲突**。要创建一个鼓励思想冲突的文化，首先领导者要表达这种价值观，表明这正是他们想要的。很多会议领导者从未表达他们对会议的期望。但如果你在会议开始时就说：“我们有一些重要的事情要讨论，我们不可能百分之百同意，所以我们希望大家能就想法进行辩论”，这样就设定了预期。然后，一旦这种情况发生，就要鼓励它。你可以评论说：“萨沙，对此有什么不同的看法？给我一些不一样的想法。”所以，引导者可以持续促进提出不同的观点。然后，我想分享另一种方法，因为这种方法最为独特。在会议中制造冲突的最佳方法之一是**沉默**。也就是说，如果团队成员不通过口头交流，而只是在文档中打字互动。例如，假设我们正在围绕进入市场的替代方法进行头脑风暴，我们可以口头讨论，也可以在共享文档中打字，每个人都输入自己的想法，然后对其他人的想法添加评论。当以沉默的方式进行头脑风暴时，想法的范围会大得多，你会得到很多不同的想法，因为在沉默中，每个人都可以同时贡献，而且他们不会受到第一个听到的声音的最大影响，因为一切都是同时发生的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah that's great we definitely want conflict in meetings but we want conflict of ideas not conflict of personalities y and to create a culture where conflict occurs of ideas it starts with the leader expressing values that this is actually what they want right so so many meeting leaders never express what their hopes are in this meeting but if you start the meeting saying we have some important things to talk about that there's no way we all 100% agree so we want people to go to battle over ideas right so create the expectation then once that me happens encourage it right so you can make comments Sasha what is the alternative perspective on this give me something different right so the facilitation could help keep promoting alternative perspectives and then I want to share one other way because this next way is the most different one of the greatest ways of creating conflict in meetings is silence namely if groups interact with no voices and basically are just typing into a document so for example let's say we're brainstorming around alternative approaches to penetrate a market right we could do that with our mouths or we could type into a shared document with everyone putting in their ideas and then adding you know comments on others ideas when brainstorming is done with silence the range of ideas is much greater and you get so many different ideas because when you were doing it in silence everyone could contribute at once and they weren't being most influenced by the first voice they heard because everything occurred simultaneous.</p>
</details>

### 会议的有效收尾与反馈机制

**主持人：** 很有趣。如何结束会议？这是一个非常重要的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">interesting how do you wrap up a meeting that's such an important question.</p>
</details>

**Steven Rogelberg：** 我们知道会议会结束，但会议往往没有一个明确的“收尾”。最好的会议都有一个收尾。基本上，在会议还剩五分钟或三分钟时，你停下来，说：“好的，我们已经讨论过了，现在需要总结一下。这是我们对这些事情的决定。对于每一项决定，我们都明确了**直接责任人**（DRI: Directly Responsible Individual: 对某项任务或决策负最终责任的人）。”这样，没有人会离开会议时还在想“到底决定了什么？谁负责？”作为收尾的一部分，你还会指出可以在下次会议中继续讨论的未决问题。所以，这种总体的总结，这种结束方式，不仅对参会者非常有帮助，对未参会者也很有帮助。也就是说，如果你记录下来，那些未参会的人会觉得“我没去也没关系”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we know meetings end but meetings often don't have an ending and the best meetings haven't ending basically with five minutes left or three minutes left you stop you stop and you say okay we've had this conversation we now need to wrap this up here's what we decided for each of these things that was decided we've identified the Dr directly responsible individual so therefore no one leaves the meeting wondering what was decided and who's responsible as part of that ending you're also indicating outstanding issues that can be picked up at the next meeting so this General wrapup right this closing is so helpful not only for the people attending but also the people not attending namely if you document that it helps those people who are not attending feel it's okay that I wasn't there.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 在这个基金中，我们在会议结束后会评估会议，领导者会评估团队会议。这是好做法还是坏做法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh in this fund we rate our meetings uh after the meeting the leader group meetings is that a good a there or a bad a there?</p>
</details>

**Steven Rogelberg：** 我倾向于认为是好的，但我们如何使用这些数据需要更细致的考量。我需要更多了解你们如何利用这些数据。但这是我认为这是个好主意的原因：正如我之前提到的，领导者认为他们比其他人更擅长主持会议，所以存在这种脱节，领导者存在盲点。当你存在盲点时，你就没有动力做出改变，因为你认为一切进展顺利，为什么要改变呢？你总是认为会议问题是别人的，而不是你的。所以，反馈和数据是帮助提供意识和启示的关键部分。我喜欢人们能获得关于他们在这个角色中表现的某种汇总数据的想法。顺便说一句，另一种实现方式是查看你的员工敬业度调查。该调查中是否有关于会议的内容？很可能答案是没有，而这是一个巨大的错失机会，可以将人们实际工作时间花费在会议上的情况纳入你的员工敬业度调查报告系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it I lean good um but how we use the data that needs to be a little bit more Nuance so I I'd have to learn a little bit more how you leverage those data but here's why I think it's a good idea as I mentioned earlier leaders think they're much better at running meetings than others so there's this disconnect there's a blind spot that these leaders have and when you have this blind spot you're not very motivated to make changes right because you think it's going well so why would you change you constantly believe that the meeting problem is everyone else not you so the feedback and the data are critical pieces for helping to provide awareness and Enlightenment so I love the idea of people getting some type of aggregated data on how they're doing in this role another way of carrying it out by the way is to go to your engagement survey is there any content on meetings in that engagement survey and likely the answer is no and that's a tremendous missed opportunity to build into your engagement survey Reporting System content on how people are actually spending their time at work.</p>
</details>

### 会议形式的多样性：站立会议与虚拟会议的潜力

**主持人：** 我们应该站着开会吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">should we be standing up sometimes?</p>
</details>

**Steven Rogelberg：** 有时可以，但并非总是如此。是的，研究普遍表明，站立会议所需时间几乎减半，并且能产生类似质量的结果。所以站立会议不是一个坏主意，但如果是长时间的会议，没有人会想长时间站着，所以我们必须深思熟虑。但我认为你的问题非常重要，它说明了当你主持会议时，你有很多选择。你可以用很多不同的方式来开会，对吧？你可以在沉默中进行，可以让人站着，可以在小组讨论前先让人们分成对子。你有很多选择可以提升会议体验。所以，退一步，做出选择。有时，一个15分钟的快速会议，人们只是聚在一起，站立会议可能很完美。但如果你正在进行一个8小时的务虚会，站立会议可能不是最佳选择。这可能没错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but not always so yes the research generally shows that meetings standing up take nearly half as much time and produce the similar quality outcomes so standing up was not a bad idea but certain meeting if a long meeting no one's going to want to be standing for a long period of time so we just have to be thoughtful but I think what's so important about your question and what it speaks to is that when you're leading a meeting you have choices there's lots of different ways you can run this meeting right you can do it in silence you can have people stand up you can have people get into pairs before they start talking as a group right you have a lot of things that you can actually make choices of that can Elevate The Experience so step back and make a choice at times a 15minute quick meeting where people are kind of coming together a standup could be perfect if you're having an8 hour Retreat a standing up meeting is probably not the best choice that's probably right.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 那么，线上会议与线下会议有何不同？我们需要注意哪些事项？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now how does it differ um online uh instead of uh in person what are the things we need to be to be aware of?</p>
</details>

**Steven Rogelberg：** 很好的问题。在疫情之前，虚拟会议的评价非常非常低。面对面会议被参会者认为是一种更丰富、更好的体验。但人们在虚拟会议方面变得越来越好，我们看到虚拟会议的效率随着时间的推移而提高，现在人们普遍认为它与面对面会议的效果差不多。有趣的是，虚拟会议在某些方面具有更大的潜力。为什么？因为会议室本身是民主的，对吧？在虚拟会议中，每个人都处于平等的地位，没有“主位效应”。所以它对人们来说更加开放和易于访问。你可以使用聊天功能，聊天已被证明是将更多声音带入对话的绝佳机制。你还有各种插件，可以匿名进行快速投票和达成共识，这样你就不会只受到最大声音的影响，而是可以快速测试共识。所以，虚拟会议有很多理由可以表现出色，甚至比面对面会议更好。

<p class="english-text">great question um before the pandemic virtual meetings were ranked very very low right so face-to-face meetings were considered um by attendees to be a much richer better experience but people have gotten better with virtual meetings we're seing virtual meeting Effectiveness increase over time and basically people's perceptions generally see it around the same now as face to face interestingly virtual meetings have in some ways more potential why because the meeting room is inherently Democratic right everyone is on an equal plane in a virtual meeting you don't have head of table effects right so it's an open for much more accessible for people you have the access to chat and chat has been shown to be a great mechanism for bringing more voices into the conversation you also have these various plugins that allow for quick voting and consensus taking done anonymously so you're not just influenced by the loudest voices but you can quickly test consensus so there's so many reasons that virtual meetings can Excel and even be better than face Toof face.</p>

### 会议中的多任务处理：糟糕会议的症状

**主持人：** 多任务处理呢？您怎么看？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">multitasking what do you think what I think about multitasking yeah I love multitasking.</p>
</details>

**Steven Rogelberg：** 关于会议中的多任务处理，这真的很有趣，因为通常当人们在会议中进行多任务处理时，他们实际上是在做自己的工作。所以这是一种伤害会议但却帮助组织的行为。这很疯狂，是一个非常有趣的现象。但多任务处理通常是一种症状，它是**糟糕会议的症状**。是的，所以会议很无聊，或者你不知道自己为什么在那里。

<p class="english-text">oh in meetings multitasking is really intriguing because generally when people are multitasking in meetings they're actually doing their work they're actually doing their work so it's a behavior that hurts the meeting but helps the organization it's crazy it's a very interesting phenomenon but multitasking is generally a symptom it is a symptom of a bad meeting yeah so it's just boring or you wonder why you're there yeah.</p>

### 一对一会议：员工发展与留才的关键

**主持人：** Steven，我们现在谈论的是大型会议，但您也写了一本关于一对一会议的书。您确实写过书，这很棒。那么，什么是一对一会议？它们为什么重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Stephen we talked about um kind of bigger meetings now but you also written a book about one-on-one meetings I have you have for sure written books that's great now what is um what is a one-one meeting and why are they important?</p>
</details>

**Steven Rogelberg：** 谢谢。我们的日常生活中充满了各种一对一的交流，但我谈论的是一种不同的东西。我写的这本书叫做《很高兴我们相遇：一对一会议的艺术与科学》（Glad We Met: The Art and Science of One-on-One Meetings）。在这种语境下，我所说的一对一会议，是指由经理与她或他的一位直接下属主持和安排的会议。但**这不是为经理而设的会议，而是为员工而设的会议**。这是一个让员工能够表达他们的想法、意见以及任何他们心中所想的会议。经理只是对员工所说的内容做出回应。这是一个专门的空间，真正去了解你的员工。关于它的研究令人惊叹：当经理与员工定期进行一对一会议时，他们不仅仅是询问工作进展报告（因为那又是为了经理自己），而是努力理解员工的挑战、想法、担忧以及短期和长期的机会。当你以员工的方式与他们充分互动时，这些员工往往会更加投入，你的顶尖人才也更容易留住，他们对团队和组织的归属感更强，人们之间的协作也更好。

<p class="english-text">thank you our days are filled with one-on-one encounters but I'm talking about something different so this book that I wrote It's called glad we met the Art and Science of one-on-one meetings when I'm talking about a one-on-one meeting in that context what I'm talking about is a meeting that's facilitated and orchestrated by a manager with one of her or his direct reports but it is a meeting not for the manager yeah it is a meeting for that employee it is a meeting for that employee to be able to express their thoughts and ideas and whatever is on their minds the manager is just reacting to what the employee it's a dedicated space to truly see your people and and the research on it is amazing that when managers have these regular one-on-ones with their people where they're not just asking for status reports because again that's for them but they're trying to understand your challenges your thoughts your concerns um your opportunities both shortterm and long-term when you fully engage with that person on their terms these individuals tend to be more engaged they your top talent tends to be more retainable they feel more committed to the team team and to the organization and people are better coordinated.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 那应该多久进行一次一对一会议呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and how often should you do them?</p>
</details>

**Steven Rogelberg：** 我们从两个角度研究了这个问题。首先，我们询问人们他们希望以何种频率与经理进行一对一会议，绝大多数人选择了**每周一次**。然后我们研究了结果，即会议频率与员工工作投入度之间的关系，结果完美吻合：每周一次或每两周一次的一对一会议与组织的最佳结果相关。如果每月一次，这种关系就会缺乏连续性，对话会变得陈旧和脱节，故事无法连贯。但是一个经理应该有多少个一对一会议或多少个这样的关系呢？你应该与你的每一位直接下属进行一对一会议。希望你的直接下属不超过10人。但这里有一个非常好的消息：一对一会议的关键不在于时长，而在于**规律性**。所以，如果我每周给你20分钟高质量的交流，它产生的积极效果与我给你一小时是相同的。因此，当经理看着日程表说“我没有时间进行一对一会议”时，真正的问题是，如果你没有时间，你就会失去你最优秀的人才。如果你不投资于这些关系，团队就不会蓬勃发展。我们都听过那句格言：人们离开的不是糟糕的工作，而是糟糕的老板。一对一会议正是你向员工证明你不是一个糟糕老板的机会。

<p class="english-text">well we looked at that from two perspectives first of all we ask people what is your preferred Cadence to meet with your manager in this one-on-one meeting and by far it was weekly then we looked at the outcomes so we examine how frequently you have them and then people's engagement on the job it lined up perfectly weekly one-on-ones or every other week one-on-ones where associated with the best outcomes for the organization when they're every month the relationship doesn't have the continuity right the the the conversations become stale and disjointed the story doesn't come through but a manager how many oneon-one meetings or how many relationships should a manager Have and Have one-on-one meetings with you think so you should be having one-on-ones with every single one of your direct reports yeah hopefully you don't have more than 10 direct reports but here's the super good news it's less about the amount of minutes in these one-on-ons and more about the regularity of it so if I give you 20 good minutes every week that had the same positive outcomes as even if I gave you an hour so as a manager looks at the calendar goes I don't have time to do one-on-ones really the question is if you don't have the time you're going to lose lose your best people right if you don't invest in these relationships the team won't Thrive we've all heard that adage that people don't leave bad jobs they leave Bad Bosses one-on-ones are your opportunity to prove to your people that you're not a bad boss.</p>
</details>

**主持人：** 既然一对一会议如此显而易见，为什么人们还会犹豫不决呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">why do you think people are hesitant to have them then if if they're so no-brainer?</p>
</details>

**Steven Rogelberg：** 因为每个人都时间紧迫，他们总是在思考哪些会议不需要开。我书的另一个备选标题（我最终没用，但很想用）是“永远不应该变成邮件的会议”，因为一对一会议的本质就是如此。我非常相信“信号”这个概念。作为领导者，我们总是在向员工发送信号，关于什么对我们重要，什么不重要。想想看，当你没有进行一对一会议时，你向员工发出了什么信号？你发出的信号是，他们对你来说并没有那么重要。

<p class="english-text">because everyone is so pressed with time that they're constantly thinking of what type of meeting do I not not need to have and the alternative title for my book that I didn't use but I was tempted was the one meeting that should never be an email because that's really what a one-on-one is I'm a big believer in looking at this notion of signals As Leaders we are always sending signals to our people signals about what's important to us and what's not think about the signal you send to your people when you do not have a one-on-one you're sending the signal that they really don't matter that much to you.</p>

**主持人：** 是的，我们都需要被看见，对吧？所以我想这也是其中一部分。

### 导师制度与一对一会议的结合

**主持人：** 那么，导师制度（mentoring）在这里扮演什么角色？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">where does mentoring come in here?</p>
</details>

**Steven Rogelberg：** 导师制度与一对一会议的整个概念完美契合，因为导师通常在对话中没有个人议程。一个好的导师或教练会帮助以对方的方式与人互动。因此，这些一对一会议绝对是提供指导和辅导的机会，但员工是主动打开这扇门的。所以你不会带着“哦，我有一些反馈要给你”的心态去参加这些与经理的会议，但经理可以说：“有什么我可以提供反馈的吗？有没有什么话题或任何你希望我提供反馈的？”所以他们为个人提供了机会，但由员工来主导。我们越是主导反馈过程，我们就越能接受并内化反馈。当你在一对一会议中指导或辅导某人时，如果员工说“我遇到了这个特定的问题”，经理可能会说“哦，这是解决问题的方法”。而导师会说：“那么，你认为如何解决这个问题呢？”在您看来，是来自同一公司的导师还是外部导师是更好的选择？两者皆可。这真的取决于所讨论的角色，以及员工对组织本身的熟悉程度。但总的来说，大多数导师可以在内部产生。对于某些高级职位，如果与竞争对手或其他组织进行对标特别有帮助，那么外部导师可能会更好。

<details>

<p class="english-text">mentoring fits perfectly with this whole concept of one-on-ones because a mentor is not someone generally that has a Personal Agenda in the conversation right a good Mentor a good coach is helping to engage with a person on their terms and so the these one-on-ones are absolutely an opportunity to provide mentoring and coaching but the employee is opening the door for it right so you don't go into these meetings with a manager saying oh I have some feedback for you but the manager can say is there anything that I can share some feedback are there any topics or anything that you want me to share feedback on right so they they have the door available to the the individual but the employee gets to drive and the more that we drive and that feedback process the more we accept the feedback and internalize it right when you're mentoring or coaching someone in these one-on-ones if the employee says I'm having this particular problem now the manager can say oh here's a solution to the problem a mentor would say well what are your thoughts on how to address that problem in your mind is a um a mentor from the same company or an external Mentor the better choice it could be either one um it really depends on the in the role in question um generally and how new the employee is to the organization itself but generally speaking uh most mentors can emerge internally for some types of High Senior roles where um benchmarking with other competitors or other organizations could be particularly helpful an external Mentor could be better.</p>
