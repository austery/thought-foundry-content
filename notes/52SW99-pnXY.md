### 委内瑞拉与乌克兰的商业挑战

**Tracy Aloway**: 大家好，欢迎收听《Odd Lots》播客。我是**Tracy Aloway**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: Hello and welcome to another episode of the All Thoughts Podcast. I'm Tracy Aloway.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我是**Joe Weisenthal**。乔，现在有很多讨论的话题，但说到最近**特朗普**政府对委内瑞拉的“接管”，我不知道该怎么形容它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: And I'm Joe Weisenthal. Joe, one of the big topics of discussion, there are a lot of topics of discussion nowadays, but when it comes to the recent uh takeover of Venezuela, the Trump administration's takeover of Venezuela, I don't know how.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 收购？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: Acquisition?

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我不知道该怎么形容。但委内瑞拉的行动，你看到人们讨论的一个主题或事情是，即使目标是获得更多石油，委内瑞拉的石油工业也是一团糟。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Acquisition, I don't know how to describe it. Um, but the action in Venezuela, one of the themes or things that you saw people talking about was this idea that, well, even if the goal is to get more oil, Venezuela's oil industry is a mess.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 一片狼藉，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: It's in shambles, right?

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的。所以你会听到一些说法，比如生锈停靠在码头的船只、不工作的泵等等。人们谈论的是摇摇欲坠的基础设施，以及糟糕的营商环境。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah. So, you hear things about, you know, ships that are rusting in the dock and pumps that don't work and whatever. People talking about really creaky infrastructure and also just a bad environment for doing business.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的，这就是问题所在。在委内瑞拉的具体背景下，我们知道石油基础设施多年来一直在退化，这就是为什么有大量数据表明，要重新启动石油生产需要巨额前期投资。但还有另一个全球现象，那就是地下自然资源的存在与将其商业化开采之间，并没有太大的直接联系。在格陵兰岛也是如此，在运营良好的**西澳大利亚**也是如此。地下或任何地方的资产，如果没有法治、精炼、加工、运输等基础设施，就毫无意义。因此，在所有这些不同程度的地方，某种资产（在委内瑞拉是石油）的实际存在，只是故事的一部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah. I mean this is the thing and so in the Venezuela specific context we know that the oil infrastructure has been degraded for years which is why there is all these numbers about the massive amounts of upfront investment that would be required to get the oil started. But then there is this other phenomenon that's global which is that there's really not much of a connection per se between the existence of natural resources in the ground and some way to get them out commercially anywhere. This also happens to be the case in Greenland. It happens to be the case in Western Australia which is a very like well-run country which is that assets in the ground or anywhere mean nothing without the sort of rule of law refining processing shipping infrastructure etc. So all these places of various different degrees, the actual existence of some asset, in Venezuela's case, oil, that's only part of the story.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 没错。这让我思考，在委内瑞拉这样的地方做工业生意到底是什么样的？我一直想更多地了解委内瑞拉经济，我觉得它很有趣，现在更有趣了。所以，这正是我们今天要做的。我们还要谈谈在另一个热点地区做生意。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: Absolutely. So this got me thinking, what is it like to actually uh do some sort of industrial business in a place like Venezuela, and I always wanted to do more on the Venezuelan economy. I I think it's pretty interesting and more interesting now. So that is exactly what we're going to do today. We're also going to talk about doing business in another um.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 热点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Hotspot.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 热点，这个词用得很好，那就是乌克兰。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: Hot spot. Hotspot is a good way of putting it, which is Ukraine.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 对吧？在俄罗斯入侵乌克兰后，我们立即制作了几期节目，讨论对粮食业务的影响。但重要的是，我们没有深入探讨太多，虽然我觉得我们确实提了一点，那就是粮食业务，小麦出口业务，它仍然存在，只是受到了损害。但在那种紧张环境下，日常商业运营如何变化，以及在新的竞争压力下如何变化？我只想再说一件事，就是你刚才问，现在用什么词来形容我们与委内瑞拉的关系。我也一直在思考这个问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Right? We did a number of episodes um in immediately after Russia's invasion of Ukraine talk about the effects on the grain business. But the important thing, which we didn't get into that much, although I think we did a little bit, is like, well, the grain business, the wheat export business, it still exists. It was impaired. But then the day-to-day business of running a commercial operation in that intense environment, how that changes and so forth and so forth. How does that change under uh the new competitive strains? And I just want to say one more thing which is you know when you talked about well what is the right word now to describe our relationship with Venezuela. It's I've been thinking about a lot of this too because.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 你有词吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: You have a word.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 不，我没有，因为它非常依赖语境。如果你听政府的说法，他们会说**马杜罗**被逮捕了，对吧？如果你认为这是公然违反国际法的行为，你会说他被绑架了等等。几乎没有词可以形容它。你看到总统谈论已经出售委内瑞拉石油。那么，这已经是谁的石油了？至少可以说，这是一个非常奇怪的局面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: No I don't because it it's very context dependent. Right. If you were to listen to the administration he's like oh Madura was arrested right? If you believe this was a flagrant violation of international law, you'd say he was kidnapped, etc. There's almost no words to describe it. You saw the president talking about already selling Venezuelan oil. So, whose oil is this already? It's just a it's a very odd situation to say the least.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 确实如此。好的，说到奇怪的局面，我们请来了最合适的嘉宾来谈论它们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: Definitely. Um, okay. So, speaking of odd situations, we have the perfect guests to talk about them.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我得说，我刚看到一个头条新闻：“**特朗普**称美国寻求立即就收购格陵兰岛进行谈判。”所以，在某个时候，我们还会再谈论与世界上我们不怎么关注的地区之间奇怪的关系。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: And just I just got to say I got a headline. US seeks immediate talks on acquiring Greenland, Trump says. So, at some point we will have another conversation about weird relationships with parts of the world that we um didn't think about as much.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 是的，关于格陵兰经济的节目迟早会到来。好的，我们今天将与**Agris Academy**的联合创始人**Jeff Kasin**和另一位联合创始人**Mike Rolson**对话。Jeff和Mike，非常感谢你们的到来，非常感谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: Yeah, the Greenland economy episode is uh is inevitably going to arrive. Okay, so we're going to be speaking with Jeff Kasin. He is the co-founder of Agris Academy and also the other co-founder Mike Rolson. So, Jeff and Mike, thank you so much for coming on. Really appreciate it.

</details>

**Jeff Kasin**: 谢谢邀请。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Kasin**: Thanks for having us.

</details>

**Mike Rolson**: 是的，谢谢邀请。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Rolson**: Yeah, thanks for having us.

</details>

### 嘉吉高管职业生涯回顾

**Tracy Aloway**: 那么，首先，你们能不能简单介绍一下你们的职业经历？因为这就是我们今天和你们对话的原因。你们两位都在**嘉吉**公司有着非常漫长而有趣的职业生涯，嘉吉是全球最大的农业综合企业之一。所以，我想，跟我们谈谈我们为什么和你们对话吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: So, first of all, why don't you give us a sort of um nutshell summary of your career history because this is why we're talking to you. Both of you had very long interesting careers at Cargill, which is, you know, one of the massive massive agricultural conglomerates among other things. So, talk to us about why why we're talking to you, I guess.

</details>

**Jeff Kasin**: 好的，我想我先开始。我是**Jeff Kasin**。我在**嘉吉**工作了整整30年，从基层做起，比如在**路易斯安那州巴吞鲁日**的港口采购谷物出口。我曾是小麦交易主管，做了很多小麦交易。后来，我在他们的并购部门工作了一段时间，在全球范围内考察各种业务，最终成为**嘉吉**和**孟山都**合资公司的首席执行官。之后我转到植物油部门，特别是精炼植物油，担任我们所称的“西部”（即西半球）精炼油交易主管，这正是我与委内瑞拉业务产生联系的地方。**嘉吉**在那里有一个非常大的石油业务，实际上是一个包装油业务。我职业生涯的最后阶段是在饲料部门，涉及大量的水产养殖，全球各地的大型三文鱼饲料、虾类以及各种水产养殖，然后是南拉丁美洲的饲料业务，一直到阿根廷。所以，这是一个典型的、高度多样化的**嘉吉**职业生涯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Kasin**: Yeah, I guess I'll start out. This is Jeff Kasin. I um I did a full career in cardio 30 years and you know started at the ground up you know at the you know Baton Rouge Louisiana ports buying grain to go to export was a head of wheat trading did a lot of wheat trading at some point spent some time in their mergers acquisition shop around the world looking at various businesses ended up as a CEO of a joint venture between Cargill and Monsanto at the time switched over into the vegetable oils particularly the refined vegetable oils was the head of trading for the what we call the west. So the western hemisphere on the refined oil side and that's actually where my time with Venezuela was connected. Cargo had a very large uh oils business there actually a packaged oils business and I finished up my career um in the feed side. A lot of aquaculture, very large salmon feeders around the world, shrimp, all kinds of various aquaculture and then really the western side uh south Latin America on the feed side all the way to Argentina. So, a typical uh highly varied uh cargo career.

</details>

**Mike Rolson**: 我的经历也类似。当年**Jeff**和我刚开始工作时，**嘉吉**会刻意把你派到很多不同的地方。所以，是的，我在90年代初到中期担任过三个不同的国内职位，这让你在美国的不同市场积累了经验。我也参与了**休斯顿**的出口业务，和**Jeff**做的事情类似。大约五年后，我被选中去了乌克兰。当时**嘉吉**在那里还没有真正的商业存在。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Rolson**: Similar story with me back then when Jeff and I started, you know, Cargle intentionally threw you around to many different places. So, yeah, I had three different domestic roles in the in the early to mid '90s uh that that got your feet wet in different markets in the United States. And I also was involved on the export side out of Houston, you know, similar to what Jeff did. And then about five years in, I got tapped on the shoulder to go to Ukraine. There was no real commercial presence for Cargill then. I was.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 我们说的是哪一年？抱歉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: What year are we talking about? Sorry.

</details>

**Mike Rolson**: 那是1995年4月。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Rolson**: This was this would have been April of 1995.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: Okay.

</details>

**Mike Rolson**: 是的。当时我还年轻，单身，会说俄语。我可能有点开玩笑地说。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Rolson**: Yeah. So, I was uh I was young. I was single. I spoke Russian. I was uh perhaps tongue and cheek.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 你符合所有条件。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: You ticked all the boxes.

</details>

**Mike Rolson**: 可有可无的。而且，当时我一无所知，可能也很难找到人去那里。是的，我当时已经举手表示愿意去，幸运的是他们联系了我，给了我这个机会。我在那里度过了五年美好的时光，基本上把一个理论上的代表处发展成了七八个业务部门，投资了数亿美元。所以，那五年是一段非常棒的经历。我回来后不久也和**Jeff**一起在并购部门工作过，之后又在企业风险投资部门工作了一段时间，比**Jeff**早一点离开了**嘉吉**，然后进入了一个科技导向的风险投资公司。大约三年前，我们启动了现在的公司。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Rolson**: Expendable and uh you know with a with a blank slate that that not really knowing what was going on at the time and probably rather difficult to find people to come there. Yeah. I I I I had raised my hand already to go and and and fortunately they they circled back to me and gave me that opportunity and it was five wonderful years there taking it basically from a from a theoretical representative office to I think I think we had seven or eight business units and a couple hundred million dollars invested. So it was a wonderful experience over those 5 years and uh I also was with Jeff in the merger and acquisition shop uh shortly after returning and uh went into corporate ventures for a while after that and left Cargill a little earlier than Jeff did and went through a tech and and um tech oriented venture capital. Then about 3 years ago we kicked this off. Um, I hope.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我希望你们不介意我们把这变成一个五小时的对话，因为我想会有无数的故事，而且我已经有无数个问题了。所以，我们会即兴发挥一些。**Jeff**，跟我们谈谈你在委内瑞拉做生意的那些年，以及那些年份的不同，还有你所看到的从开始到结束的不同情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: You guys are cool with us turning this into a fivehour conversation now because I imagine there's an incredible number of stories and I already have a uh billion questions. So, we're going to be doing a little bit of that on the fly. Jeff, talk to us about the years you did business with Venezuela and maybe the difference in what years those were and then the sort of different conditions from like the beginning to the end as you saw them.

</details>

### 委内瑞拉的恶性通货膨胀

**Jeff Kasin**: 是的。因为石油业务，我与它紧密相连。我想说，那是一项多样化的业务，我最终负责监督所有交易，因为我也有很多谷物交易经验。可能最重要的一点是，我记得我刚开始时，**玻利瓦尔**（委内瑞拉货币）的汇率大约是1比800。我得把年份弄对，我想三年后，汇率大概是1比12000左右。我们最终陷入了超级恶性通货膨胀时期，经济基本上停滞了。如果你没有一个正常运作的货币，而政府又强制你用当地货币销售，你就必须有办法进行兑换。我们实际上变得依赖政府进行兑换，以便出去购买美元计价的原材料。现在，全球贸易的80%仍然以美元计价，大部分谷物贸易也是如此。这可能是最能说明问题的一点：货币停止了功能，这彻底改变了委内瑞拉的局面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Kasin**: Yeah. So, uh, because of the oils business, I was attached to that and I'd like to say that, um, it was a varied business and I ended up and I have a lot of grain experience, too. So, I ended up kind of the head of overseeing trading for all of it. And probably the the biggest statement is I think when I started the boulevard, the currency was like 1 to 800. And this is and I get my years right and I think you know three years later it was like 1 to 12,000 or something like that. We ended up we ended up in that period of super hyperinflation where the economy basically seizes up and you know you [clears throat] watch from the capability if you don't have a functioning currency and the government makes you sell in local currency in order to go you have to have some way to exchange it and we effectively became dependent on the government to do the exchange to go out and buy dollarized raw materials. Right now, 80% of global trade is still in dollars and a lot of the grain trade is. And that probably is the most single telling thing. The currency ceased to function and that [clears throat] really changed the game on the ground in Venezuela.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 我想稍后深入探讨一些货币复杂性，但我很惊讶**嘉吉**在委内瑞拉竟然还有业务。你能告诉我们**嘉吉**在那里具体做什么吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: I want to get into some of the currency complications in a little bit, but I was surprised that Cargill had any business at all in Venezuela. Can you just tell us what exactly Cargill was doing over there?

</details>

### 嘉吉在委内瑞拉的业务

**Jeff Kasin**: 是的，请记住我目前是前雇员，而且**嘉吉**在那里已经不再拥有业务了。我当时是**嘉吉**联系的。基本上，这很符合**嘉吉**的典型做法。他们会先派女性员工去，她们会出去，从女性员工开始，他们有长期的食盐业务。食盐在那里是一个大业务。**嘉吉**是全球主要的食盐生产商，很多事情都是悄悄进行的。我想那里有很多工业用盐。他们有石化业务在使用食盐。我其实不是石化方面的专家。然后，他们在世界各地有很多食品加工业务。在这种情况下，他们是天然面粉厂、炼油厂、装油厂。我在世界其他地方没有见过大米业务，我到那里的时候，这个业务已经没有了。还有意大利面工厂。所以，在这种情况下，可能更独特的是，我们不仅进行初级加工，而且一直做到消费品。他们实际上拥有一个非常好的品牌，我认为是他们通过收购获得的头号品牌。我想**邦吉**（Bunge）在那里也有一个收购案，比我早。所以，他们知道，这是一个非常富裕的国家，一个可以做很多好生意的地方，然后可以在世界各地的多个国家复制这种模式。所以，是的，他们就是这样进入那里的，这是一个非常自然的流程，而且他们在那里有非常大的投资。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Kasin**: Yeah, and keep in mind I'm currently a former employee and and Cargill does not own the business there anymore. I was reached out to by Cargill. Basically, this is very typical of Cargill. They'll have females. They'll go in, they they go out, they'll start with females, they'll uh they had the long-term salt. Salt was a big play there. Cargo is a large producer globally of salt. A lot of things quietly. I think there was a lot of industrial use salt there. They had the prochemical business was using salt. I don't actually am not an expert on the petrochemical side. And then they're in lots of food processing businesses around the world. In this case, you know, they were natural flour millers, uh, oil refineries, oil bottlers, the rice I had not seen anywhere else in the world. Um, it was actually gone by the time I got there. Uh, pasta plants. So in this case, probably the more unique thing was that not only were we doing primary processing, but we were going all the way to consumer. They actually had a very I think the number one brand that they had bought over time. I think there was an acquisition from Bungy predates me uh in there also. So they were, you know, this was a very wealthy country and and a place where you could do some very good business in and then repeat that model in multiple countries all over the world. And so um yeah, that's how they got there. It was very natural flow and they had a very large investment [music] there.

</details>

### 乌克兰后苏联时代的乐观与挑战

**Joe Weisenthal**: **Mike**，关于乌克兰，1995年仍然是后苏联时代真正乐观的早期，对吧？人们还没有变得厌倦，他们可能还没有意识到苏联解体后会出现的各种病态等等。请谈谈对乌克兰的考量和希望，以及在这些年里，你对这个市场的关注和工作，这些希望与预期相比是如何展开的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Mike on Ukraine, you know, 1995 is still the early days of real posts Soviet optimism, right? And people hadn't become jaded yet, and they probably hadn't woken up to sort of all the various pathologies and stuff that would occur in the wake of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, etc. talk a little bit about the calculation and the hopes for Ukraine and the degree to which you know over the many years that you've uh paid attention to this market and worked in it how they unfolded relative to say expectations.

</details>

**Mike Rolson**: 嗯，我几乎会说你低估了当时的乐观情绪。1995年，那里充满了巨大的乐观情绪。我们有一个非常有活力的团队。坦率地说，即使是我们找到的那些年长的人，他们帮助我们开展商业活动，尽管他们只知道旧体制，但他们经验丰富、勤奋工作，非常兴奋地投入到我们以非常独特的方式所做的事情中。所以，我们的团队里有22岁刚毕业的“摇滚明星”，也有60岁的老“摇滚明星”，他们可能在苏联时期有过一些农业方面的经验，但能够将其传授给我们。那真是一段非常棒的经历。那不仅仅是一份工作，你觉得它具有变革性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Rolson**: Well, I I I almost would say you uh underestimated the optimism at the time you know in in in 95 there was a tremendous amount of optimism there. We had a very dynamic team. Quite frankly, uh even the older folks that we would find uh to help be a part of what we were doing commercially, even though they all they had known is is the system, there there were folks that that were experienced and hardworking and very excited to to to jump into uh the sort of things that we were doing in a very differentiated way. So we had we had rock stars in our group that were 22 and out of school and we had rock stars that were 60 years old that were probably had had some sort of legacy experience in agriculture uh in the Soviet Union but was able to translate that to us and uh it was an absolutely um fantastic experience back then. It was more than just a job. It was you felt it was transformational. It was uh.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 你正在改变那里的商业运作方式。那里存在着疯狂的混乱，但以有纪律、道德的方式工作，让你通过另一种途径获得了业务。所以，是的，我们成功了。那是当时典型的**嘉吉**风格，有点开创性和创业精神。是的，我们成功了，从贸易方面开始，然后慢慢地在当地建立资产，以及许多其他更正式的东西，使得到了2000年我离开的时候，它越来越像一个常规的地区。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: You were changing the way business got done there. There was there was an insane amount of chaos but working in a regimented uh ethical way got you business by by uh you know in another route. So yeah we made it work. It was it was classic Cargle at the time sort of being sort of pioneering and and entrepreneurial and uh yeah we made it work and started with the trading side and slowly but surely put assets on the ground and a lot of other more formal things that made it look more and more like a regular geography by the time you know the year 2000 rolled around and and when I left.

</details>

### 远程与实地管理

**Tracy Aloway**: 那么**Mike**，你在乌克兰实地工作，而**Jeff**你是在远程管理委内瑞拉的业务。实际情况是怎样的？因为我想，我们现在谈论的是几十年前的事情，当时的通讯肯定比现在困难。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: So Mike you were on the ground in Ukraine and Jeff you were managing the Venezuela business remotely. What was that actually like? because I imagine you know we're talking about um a couple decades back now communication must have been more difficult than it is even nowadays.

</details>

**Jeff Kasin**: 当时很常见。我不会说，当时我们有领先的**AS400**系统，所以通讯一直是贸易公司的优先事项，因此在这方面投入了大量资金。当时很常见，你会有一个，请记住我是一名交易经理，而不是整体业务经理。但我会有，我们会在每个国家都有当地的商人。你必须连接和协调他们。想想看，如果你要购买一艘多货种的船货，你会在**新奥尔良**装载各种不同的商品，然后你会利用这一点来降低运费，创造竞争优势。所以你正在协调你所在地区所有不同的交易团队。然后这实际上是在全球范围内进行的。所以你一直在寻找这种优势。所以我扮演协调角色，然后在地方层面，你必须有当地的专业知识。特别是在委内瑞拉开始变得不稳定的时候。你需要了解如何与政府打交道，如何通过各种渠道获取东西并持续完成工作的人。这需要当地的专业知识。所以这就是我所扮演的宏观角色，当然还有风险管理方面。然后你还有非常本地化的执行方面来促成事情。两者都必须有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Kasin**: Know it was very typical I wouldn't say you know there was we had leading edge uh AS400s back in the day and so communications always been a priority of a trading firm and so there was a lot of investment in that right you know that was very typical that you would have one now remember I'm a trading manager not the overall business manager But I would have, you know, we would have local merchants in each country. And you've got to connect and coordinate that. You know, think about if you're buying, say you're buying a multi-g grocery boat cargo, you're going to load that cargo in New Orleans with all kinds of different commodities and it's going to, you know, you're going to leverage that out to get your freight cost down and create competitive advantage. And so you're coordinating um all your different trading groups in the region. And then that actually goes out on a global basis. So you you're constantly looking for that edge. So I play the coordination role and then at the local level like you have to have local expertise on the ground. Particularly in the case as Venezuela started to become unstable. You need people that understand how to navigate the government, how to navigate the various, you know, channels to get things and continue to get things done. And that takes local knowhow. So that was kind of that big picture role that I would be filling and of course the risk management side. And then you have that very local execution side to make things happen. You got to have both.

</details>

**Mike Rolson**: 是的，至少在我们的外部通信以及我们如何连接方面，我们也存在同样的代理。所以我的常规通信路线是通过我们的**日内瓦**办事处，然后向**嘉吉**的其他部门传播。所以外部通信是世界级的。我们早期至少有卫星电话，通过它运行调制解调器等等。内部通信则完全是另一回事。我可能要花45分钟才能解释1995年和1996年仅仅是发送传真这样的简单事情，但后来情况有所改善，更加整合了。但是的，那是内部和外部之间的二元对立，但仍然可以管理。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Rolson**: Yeah. And the same proxy existed for us at least in our our external communication and how we linked up. So my my usual routes of communication went through our Geneva office and then you know outward throughout the throughout the rest of Cargill. So the external communication was world class. We had satellite uh phones through which we ran our modems and that kind of thing early on at least. Internal a whole different story. I could probably waste 45 minutes explaining uh just simple sending a fax type story and things like that in 1995 and 1996 but uh before things got a little bit better um integrated but but yeah it was it was a dichotomy between internal and external but uh manageable nonetheless.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 我的第一份新闻工作就是监控传真机，确保有传真进来时，新闻编辑室能知道。那真是激动人心的时代。我们很容易就能花一个小时来谈论内部沟通，以及电子邮件、**Slack**、**IB**之前的时代，**IB**之前的时代已经很久远了，但总的来说，数字文档管理之前的时代，以及那会是怎样的。也许有一天我们会再请你们回来专门谈谈这个。**Jeff**，我记得我有一个，这很有趣，我都忘了，但我大学一年级的时候有个室友，他好像为他的教会去委内瑞拉做过一些宣教工作。他当时在那里，当他成为我室友的时候，他就在谈论“哦，这个叫**乌戈·查韦斯**的家伙看起来要赢了，这会是个坏消息”等等。我当时应该更认真地对待，更关注一些。但很多人显然都担心**查韦斯**。那么，你是在什么时候开始觉得“好吧，情况正在恶化”，以及通货膨胀开始严重、做生意或进口美元计价的机器变得更加困难的过程是怎样的？什么时候这种感觉开始在业务中扎根？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: One of my first journalism jobs was literally monitoring the fax machine and making sure if a fax came in that the newsroom would be aware of it. Thrilling times. We could easily do an hour on internal communications and the sort of like pre- email, pre-Slack, preIB, well the preIB era is very long ago, but pre uh you know pre-digital document management in general and how that must have been and maybe we'll have you back just to talk one day about that. Um Jeeoff, I remember I had a um it's interesting enough I forgot about this but when my first year of college I had a roommate who I think had done some mission work for his church uh in Venezuela and he was there when uh he by the time he was roommates he was talking about oh this guy Hugo Chavez it looks like he's going to win this is going to be bad news etc and so should have taken that more seriously and paid more attention. What was though the point a lot of people were concerned about Chavez obviously. What was the point though in which you sort of saw like okay this is this is turning down and what was it and what was the process by which like oh we are starting to get serious inflation we are starting to have a more difficult time doing business or importing mach dollar denominated machinery when did that sort of sink in for the business?

### 政治动荡与货币崩溃

**Jeff Kasin**: 是的。我到的时候，我们已经到了**马杜罗**执政时期了，所以**查韦斯**的时代已经过去了。你知道，这就像温水煮青蛙，对吧？它从小处开始，然后逐渐发展，然后你会遇到所有这些意想不到的后果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Kasin**: Yeah. So I I arrived, we were already to Maduro, so we were already So Chavez uh the time there had already passed and you know it it's the it's the frog in the boiling pot, right? It it starts small and then it starts to you know and then you get all these unintended consequences.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 你在努力，然后，你知道，作为一个社会主义政权，你正在努力堵漏洞，对吧？所有这些事情都在发生，而且，你知道，你还有一个政府，它对被推翻感到极度偏执，对吧？所有这些同时都存在着权力斗争。我认为它真正地一落千丈，我的意思是，在**查韦斯**时期情况就不太好，但当货币和，你知道，正如你所说，石油工业开始恶化时，情况就更糟了。所以，美元的供应正在枯竭。支付系统中的每个人都需要越来越多的美元，对吧？这是一个持续的支付系统。然后你就是没有足够的钱，所以你就开动印钞机，对吧？我记得这一点。有一段时间，它发生得太快了，有几个故事。一个是纸币**玻利瓦尔**的**BTU**值比它能买到的东西更有价值。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: And you're you're trying to and then you know as a socialist regime you're trying to plug holes, right? And all these things that start to go on and plus you know the you also have a government that is healthfully paranoid about being overthrown, right? There's a power aspect that's going on in all of this at the same time. I think it really really took a plunge. I mean, it wasn't good at Chavez, but when the currency and, you know, as you said, the oil industry starts to deteriorate. So, that spet of dollars is dry drying off. It takes ever more dollars to pay off everybody in the system, right? It's a constant payoff system. And and then you just you don't have enough money so you just run the printing press, right? And I can remember this. There was a point it got it happened so fast a couple stories. One is the BTU of a paper boulevard the BTU value is worth more than it could buy.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 你可以烧它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: You could burn it.

</details>

**Jeff Kasin**: 所以你真的用它们当燃料烧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Kasin**: So you literally burn them for fuel.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 你可以用它当燃料烧。太疯狂了。有一段时间，他们印制**玻利瓦尔**，但他们没有支付印刷费用，而且他们是用美元在国外印刷的。他们没有足够的钱购买**玻利瓦尔**并空运进来。所以你真的开始用完地上的货币，即使你想用它。有各种各样的故事，但那大概是在**马杜罗**执政两年后，当货币停止运作时，我们才真正知道我们陷入了困境。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: You could burn it for fuel. That's crazy. And and there was a time where they were they were having the boulevards printed um but they didn't pay their printing bill and they were flying it and the printing was being done in dollars outside the country. They didn't have enough money to buy the boulevards to fly them in. So you really you started running out of currency on the ground like just even if you wanted to work on it. There's all kinds of these kind of stories, but it was right in that probably two years into Maduro space when when the currency stopped functioning, that was really when we knew we were in trouble.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 回到你刚才说的一点，一家在美国以外任何国家运营的美国公司都必须遵守美国法律，特别是与贿赂和腐败相关的事情。对于你们两位来说，我想这在两国都是一个非常突出的问题，可能委内瑞拉比乌克兰更甚，但我们知道乌克兰也存在严重的腐败问题。你们能谈谈作为一家跨国公司，在这种环境中如何运作吗？在这种环境中，可能很多人都在收取贿赂，你们是如何应对的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: Just to go back to something you said, so an American company working in any foreign country has to abide by American laws, particularly related to things like bribery and corruption. And maybe for both of you and I imagine you know that this is a very prominent issue in both these countries maybe more in Venezuela than Ukraine etc. but we know that there's significant corruption in Ukraine etc. Can you talk a little bit about essentially how you function in these environments where probably lots of people are getting paid off literally or in the bribery sense and how you have to navigate that from the perspective of a multinational.

</details>

**Mike Rolson**: 我先说。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Rolson**: I'll start.

### 应对腐败与合规经营

**Jeff Kasin**: 当然。回到90年代中期的情况，当时有两个障碍。我用“障碍”这个词，不是说它阻碍了我们，而是它确实给商业的便利性和规模制造了阻力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Kasin**: Sure. And and going back again within the uh the perspective of the mid 90s there there were two impediments and and I use the word impediment you know not not that it impeded us but it it it did create a headwind for shall we say the ease of doing business and the scale of doing business.

</details>

**Mike Rolson**: 是的。所以，给我们造成障碍的两部分是，1995年粮食业务中仍然存在相当多的政府影响，这实际上是从县级和州级（或他们所说的**州**级）一直到中央政府。所以有很多方法可以让他们满意，并悄悄地大规模采购粮食，这些粮食还会通过国有铁路系统和国有港口系统运输。所以大部分基础设施，在各个阶段都有看门人，他们可以很容易地被“催化”，可以说，以非常合理的数量将粮食运出，并进行大规模交易。我可以点名，但你知道，有很多全球贸易商不必遵守美国的规则体系。所以我们基本上是老派做法。我们直接去农场，以较小的数量，在合理的范围内，与我们信任的人合作，通过非典型的方式将粮食运出这个国家。讽刺的是，我们建立的一些基础设施在**多瑙河**系统上，它非常不规则。它是通过起重机和疏散系统等进行转运的，而不是大型、高效率的粮仓。这些是今天将粮食运出这个国家的一些方式，因为一些主要的粮仓已经被摧毁或损坏了。所以那是我们最大的问题。你知道，你可以绕过它，坦率地说，那样做更有价值，因为我们看到了我们对农业部门的影响。但那是当时我刚到那里时的大局现实。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Rolson**: Yeah. So, so, uh, the the two parts that created impediments for us is is there still was a fair amount of governmental influence in the grain business in 1995 and it really was from a county perspective and a state or what they referred to as obelist perspective all the way up to the central government. So there were plenty of ways to keep those people happy and quietly buy grain at scale that would also go through a state-owned railroad system and a stateowned port system. So most of the infrastructure and there were gatekeepers at various stages that could easily be u catalyzed shall we say uh to get grain out the door at very reasonable numbers and trade at at at at large scale. And I would uh I could name names but I you know there there's plenty of uh some of the global traders that don't have to apply to to the US u rule rulesbased system. So what we basically did is did it old school. We went straight to the farms in smaller quantities, in reasonable amounts with people we could trust and just gutted it out through atypical ways of of getting the grain out of the country, which ironically is um some of the infrastructure that we built on the Danube River system that it's very lumpy. It's trans shipment through cranes and and evacuation systems and things like that as opposed to a big, you know, highcale elevator. Those are some of the things today that are getting grain out of the country because some of the main elevators have been uh destroyed or damaged in some way. So that was our biggest problem. You know, uh it you could get around it and quite frankly it was more rewarding doing it that way because we saw our impact on the a sector. But uh that was that was sort of the big picture reality at the time when I first got there.

</details>

**Jeff Kasin**: 我认为，就我的情况而言，令人欣慰的是，作为经营者，你知道你不需要支付那种贿赂或便利费。公司在灌输这种理念方面做得非常好，每个加入的人每年都会接受培训，而且坦率地说，他们也支持这种做法。如果你因为不得不支付贿赂才能达到目标而没有完成业绩，这并不会损害你的职业生涯。他们知道你会谈论它，你会告诉他们我不会这样做，而且这种情况确实发生过，我们有很多这样的故事。所以从这方面来说，它让你的员工非常清楚如何运作。我想让你考虑的另一件事是在全球食品领域，如果你是**雀巢**（Nestlé）或**菲多利**（Frito-Lay）这样的公司，并且你在采购原材料。假设你在委内瑞拉有一家工厂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Kasin**: I think in my case it is comforting as operating is to know you don't have to pay those type of bribes or facilitating payments. The company had a did a very good job of instilling that everybody who joined trained on it yearly and and quite frankly backed it up right if you didn't make your numbers because you would have had to paid a bribe to get there. It didn't hurt you career-wise. They knew you talk about it. you tell them I'm not going to do this and it happened and we had these stories that happened but it so on that side it made it very clear for your employees to know how to operate. The other thing I want you to think about in the global food space, right, is if you're a Nestle or Fritole or one of that and you're buying raw materials. So you have a plant in Venezuela.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: Okay.

</details>

**Jeff Kasin**: 你想确保你的产品是食品安全的，达到美国标准，而且你知道这些标准，对吧？食品安全。你实际上，它实际上会吸引业务。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Kasin**: You want to make sure that you have food safe product, US grade, and you know the standards, right? Food safety. You want to actually, it actually draws business to you, right?

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 美国食品的品牌价值。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: The brand value of American food.

</details>

**Jeff Kasin**: 对吧？而且你会诚实行事，他们不需要为了让卡车在那天到达工厂而支付贿赂，对吧？诸如此类的事情，这就是你做生意的方式。所以，当时，我们称之为西方公司，现在更现代的公司，他们喜欢一起进入一些早期市场，因为他们知道他们有一个供应商，你知道，如果你为啤酒厂生产麦芽大麦，而那是一个南非啤酒厂，他们知道你实际上会签订合同并遵守合同，无论发生什么。如果遇到农作物歉收，你会信守承诺。你知道，我要向我的前雇主致敬，他们在运作方面做得非常好。我曾与他们在世界各地合作过，从鱼粉到赖氨酸再到小麦，这个品牌在这些环境中很有帮助，因为你的客户可以信赖你。在食品领域，这非常重要，对吧？因为如果你搞砸了，你可能会害死人，或者损害客户的声誉。如果有什么东西通过了，这和美国的情况一样，只是在世界偏远地区工作时，重要性可能不那么高。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Kasin**: Right? And that you're going to act honestly and they don't have to pay a bribe to get a truck, you know, to the plant on that day, right? That things like that that the way you can do business. So uh at that time let's call them western companies they're listed now today more modern companies they like to go to some of these early markets together and uh because you they knew that they had a supplier that you know if you were making malt barley for the brewery and it's a you know South African brewery they knew that you were actually going to you know make a contract and stick to the contract no matter what if we had to work it out there was crop failure you would you know hold your word was your bond and you know I'm going to tip a hat off to my former employee, they were very good about how that operated and I worked with them in places basically in any all the corners of the world and everything from you know fish meal to lysine to wheat that brand uh helps out in these environments because you you know your the customers can count on you and in food super important right because if you screw that up you can kill somebody and um or tarnish the customer's right if something gets through this that's the same way it is in the US actually but not with the maybe the same criticality when you're working in a remote location around the world.

</details>

### 与政府的关系及价格管制

**Tracy Aloway**: 这实际上引出了我非常好奇的一点，那就是**嘉吉**显然是一家私人公司，当时在**马杜罗**的社会主义政权下运营。一家私人商业企业与一个社会主义政府之间的关系是怎样的？特别是对于食品这样关键的商品，对吧？我想政府会关心食品供应。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: So this actually leads into something I'm really curious about which is obviously Cargill is a private company operating at that time under a socialist regime under Maduro what was the relationship like just between a private commercial enterprise and a socialist government especially for something as critical as food, right? I imagine the government cared about the food supply.

</details>

**Jeff Kasin**: 我们必须遵守两套法律，对吧？你必须遵守当地法律，对吧？所以，如果他们说你必须用**玻利瓦尔**交易，你就必须用**玻利瓦尔**交易。当时我们还没有**Tether**或**比特币**，对吧？所以世界正在以一种有趣的方式变化。你必须遵守。我的意思是，你不想，我不知道，惹怒熊，对吧？然后你必须有专家来了解你正在合作的政府是如何运作的，我们就是这样做的。但这仍然是一种非常常见的操作方式，在一些地方，你知道，有可可的地方，一些非洲国家，**津巴布韦**，南非，你仍然会遇到这种情况。你必须成为在困难地区工作的专家，这是一种竞争优势。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Kasin**: We we we had to follow both sets of laws, right? You have to follow the local law, too, right? So, if they say you must transact in Boulevard, you have to transact in Boulevard. Now, we didn't have Tether or Bitcoin at this point, right? So, the world's changing in an interesting way. Um, you have to follow that. I mean, you you know, you don't want to, I don't know, poke the bear, right? And then you have to have people that become experts in how whatever government you're working with runs and we do and that's how we but this was a very common still is common to operate in some of these places where.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 你知道，有可可的地方，一些非洲国家，**津巴布韦**，南非，你仍然会遇到这种情况。你必须成为在困难地区工作的专家，这是一种竞争优势。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: You know you know places that have cocoa right you know some of the African countries there Zimbabwe right South Africa um you still have this situation you have to become there is a competitive advantage in becoming experts at working in difficult places.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 你们是否曾被施压，例如，要求降低食品价格？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: Were you ever pressured though, for instance, to lower grocery prices?

</details>

**Jeff Kasin**: 哦，当然，一直都是。而且理论上，关于你能赚多少钱以及如何计算，都有法律规定。你知道，如果全球大米短缺，那不是因为全球大米短缺导致价格上涨，而是**嘉吉**在对人民这样做。你必须有一个替罪羊。你知道，在某个时候，你就是知道你不能以X价格进口，然后以X减去一大笔钱的价格出售，你只会亏损。坦率地说，在某些时候，在几个地区，我们遇到了一种情况，公司说我们不会再向这个国家投入更多美元了，我们当时就在那里，我仍然记得。所以，如果我们想进口什么，我们必须从政府那里获得美元，或者想办法出口一些能产生美元的东西。所以这就是你真正开始挣扎的地方，因为你基本上依赖政府将**玻利瓦尔**兑换成美元。嗯，这就是我们尝试各种出口方法的时候。我的意思是，那里有食盐。我们尝试过托盘，但每次你尝试做点什么，经济中的某个人就会抓住它。哦，不。如果你真的想把它运到港口，那将需要一些便利费或类似的东西。只是，那里的团队拼命地尝试，因为除了原材料，我们还需要备件。这可能与你关于那里情况的问题有关。你知道，如果你需要从**西门子**购买一些电气设备，他们不会想要**玻利瓦尔**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Kasin**: Oh, absolutely. All the time. Right. And there were laws on theoretically how much you could make and how the counting was done on that. And you know, if we had a global rice shortage, it was not the fact that we had a global rice shortage and prices rising. It was Cargill that was doing it to, you know, to the people. You you had to have an escapegoat effectively. And you know at some point you just know that you can't import at uh price X and sell it for X minus you know a bunch and you you'll just bleed out. And quite frankly at some point in several geographies we get a situation where corporation says we will put no more dollars in the country and we were there and I can still remember that. So if we wanted to import something, we had to get dollars either from the government or figure out how to export something that created dollars. So that's where you really start to struggle because you basically relying on the government to exchange boulevards for dollars. Um, and that's where we tried all kinds of things to try to export. I mean, there was salt there. We tried pallets, but every time you tried to do something, somebody in the economy was like grabbing that. Oh, no. if you really want to move that, you know, to the port, that's going to require some facilitation payment or something like that. It just and the team down there was desperately trying to because the other thing we needed beyond just raw materials, we needed spare parts. And this maybe lies to your question about what's the situation there. You know, if you need to buy some electrical equipment from Seammens, they're not going to want boulevards.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 他们想要欧元或美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: And they want euros or dollars.

</details>

### 美元获取与备件困境

**Jeff Kasin**: 所以我们不得不努力想办法产生足够的美元来购买备件。而且，你知道，我不确定，我只能从我的情况来说，现在团队真正关注的是如何获取美元，而不是日常的物流和零部件管理。他们的工作变成了如何产生美元？所以你会有几个人专门负责政府事务，他们可能会在政府办公室待很长时间，努力理清繁文缛节。然后你会有一些人努力想办法，你知道，我们能不能把堆积在那里的盐装成一吨一公斤的袋子或一公吨的袋子，然后运出这个国家并出售以产生美元。所以现在你有一个美元生成团队，这种情况在**阿根廷**也发生过，在**马莱**之前，我不知道现在情况如何，当你发生恶性通货膨胀时，你就会陷入必须有一个团队专门寻找美元的境地。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Kasin**: So, we were having to try to figure out how to generate enough dollars just to get spare parts. And um you know, I'm not sure how I can only speak from my situation is now the team is really focused instead of kind of on their day-to-day job of running logistics and and parts, you know, and getting things in. Um their jobs switch to how do we originate dollars? So you have, you know, a couple people that are just expert in government and maybe like camp out at government offices for long periods of time trying to figure out winding through the red tape. And then you have people trying to figure out, you know, hey, can we, you know, put uh one ton one kilo bag or one metric ton bags together of salt that's sitting in this pile and get them out of the country and sell them to generate dollars. So now you have a dollar generation team and that can that can play out all over Argentina before Malay I don't know what the situation is now was like that also when you have hyperinflation you get into the situation where you have to have a team that's just hunting dollars.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我没想到对话会转向这个方向，但对于你们两位中的任何一位，**Jeff**你提到了非，我没想到会在这一集里谈论**Tether**，但在今天2026年，当你想到这些存在的货币瓶颈时，加密货币，无论是稳定币还是像**比特币**这样真正去中心化的东西，人们是否认真地在实施或思考这些新的金融技术如何解决全球农业贸易中的痛点？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I wasn't expecting the conversation to go in this but for either one of you and Jeff you mentioned the non I wasn't expecting to talk about tether in this episode but in today 2026 When you think about sort of these currency bottlenecks that exist, do cryptocurrencies or whether it's stable coins or something truly decentralized like Bitcoin, are people seriously either implementing or thinking about how some of these new uh financial technologies can solve pain points within the global egg trade.

### 加密货币的潜在作用

**Jeff Kasin**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Kasin**: Yeah.

</details>

**Mike Rolson**: 嗯，再说一次，我不能具体到每个国家，但从大局来看，世界上某个地方的普通生产者，如果他们有货币问题，阻碍了他们，也许是他们银行的质量，他们获取资本的能力，他们获取外汇的能力，以升级任何东西。绝对地，**Tether**之类的东西将从根本上改变获取这类东西的方式，与以前相比，这肯定会改变。我可能会对你提出的问题补充一点点不完整的答案。有很多很棒的故事，对于那些想找点乐子的人来说，围绕**比特币**有很多故事，特别是早期在委内瑞拉进行的**比特币**挖矿。那些担心国家走向的人，他们会，你知道，利用某个地方的小型水力发电厂，也许是某个家庭在森林里的某个地方，挖**比特币**，把它放在钱包里，作为他们的逃生阀，以防万一需要。果然，有一天晚上，他们穿过丛林，去了另一个国家，钱包里有**比特币**，然后开始了新的生活。所以，是的，有一些非常有趣的早期开创性**比特币**故事，围绕着**玻利瓦尔**迫使人们在早期做的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Rolson**: Well, again, I I can't speak to the specificity maybe uh country by country, but certainly the if you look maybe in the big picture, the average producer somewhere in the world that has a currency issue where it impedes them and and maybe the quality of their bank, the their access to capital, uh their access to to foreign currency to um to upgrade whatever it is. Absolutely. the tethers of the world and things like that are going to fundamentally change the access to to to that sort of thing where where when you compare it to the way it was before for sure. And I and I will maybe add a little half answer to to what you threw out there too. There's a lot of great stories uh for folks looking for um something to to entertain themselves around Bitcoin, especially the early Bitcoin mining that was going on in Venezuela for people that were concerned about where the country was going where they would, you know, tap into a small hydro plant at maybe a family's uh place out in the woods somewhere and and and mine Bitcoin, put it on a wallet and had it as their escape valve in case they needed it. And sure enough, you there was a night where they trapesed through the jungle and went to another country and had it on their wallet and and uh started another life. So yeah, that there were some very interesting early pioneering Bitcoin stories around the what the Bolivar [music] forced folks to do uh early on.

### 委内瑞拉的人才流失

**Joe Weisenthal**: 谈谈人们离开委内瑞拉的情况，因为这也是你经常听到的事情，那就是如果你过去是一个有一定经济能力的委内瑞拉人，你就会非常有动力离开，特别是如果你在政府针对的某些行业工作。**嘉吉**也经历过这种人才流失吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Talk to us about people actually leaving Venezuela because this is also something that you hear a lot about which is you know if you were a Venezuelan with some amount of means in the past you were very incentivized to leave um especially if you were working in certain businesses that the government was targeting Did you experience that at Cargill as well? This sort of brain drain. It.

</details>

**Jeff Kasin**: 这种情况一直都在发生。首先，我想描述一下当时的场景，对吧？当时我们在**加拉加斯**有一个办公室。非常漂亮，对吧？那里有很多员工，不仅仅是因为我们有品牌业务，对吧？我们有标签设计师等等，我的意思是，那是一个全面的，你可以把它想象成**宝洁**那样的零售业务。所以办公室很大，很漂亮，我们有卫星通讯。当时还没有**星链**。所以办公室是一个很好的地方，对吧？人们实际上会说：“哦，是的，我周六在那里。”而我则会说，问题是当你离开那个办公室时，你会迅速回到你的封闭社区，更可能是一个公寓大楼。你必须从一个安全的院落到另一个安全的院落。然后情况就变成了，你不知道这周有没有水或热水。你可能好几天都没有电。你可能无法获得，杂货店里可能什么都买不到。现在我们的员工可以从我们这里获得一些食物，因为我们生产一些基本食品，对吧？每周我们都会确保从工厂运送一些东西，然后把这些东西组合起来。所以人们的生活方式并不轻松，即使是那些理论上受过良好教育、有体面工作的人。最终，我们的业务当然也在放缓，他们离开了。然后，在我们的案例中，我们有一家工厂被武装国有化了。如果你是一名高技能的经理或操作员，你不会想留下来，在枪口下工作，对吧？因为他们没有运行工厂的专业知识。所以，第一波，有人说数百万委内瑞拉人，是受教育程度最高、技能最熟练的人，这使得情况更加恶化，对吧？因为，你知道，现在没有人知道如何运行发电站，对吧？没有人知道，你知道，显然是石化工业，对吧？如果你是一名专业工程师，你可以在世界各地找到工作，没有问题。所以这些人去了世界各地。为跨国公司工作的优点是，我们尽可能多地接纳了他们。这就是，你知道，在那种对话中，你会有一个员工打电话来，他们非常爱国，他们知道自己在做重要的工作，他们受够了，然后你接到那个电话，他们会说，你知道，他们有点羞怯。他们觉得自己在抛弃你。你知道，我们会去找他们。我的故事是，你知道，我最后的一个员工说：“我要去**墨西哥城**。”我想他妻子当时在**索尼**工作，找到了一些工作。我说：“你要做什么？”他说：“我不知道，但我不想再待在这里了。”你知道，我把我的大屏幕电视和一些东西通过**DHL**寄走了，我要带着我的吉他上飞机，我受够了。我说：“好吧，我知道你要做什么。你要去这个地址，在墨西哥为我工作。”这种情况在我的雇主那里发生了数百次。你会去**墨西哥城**开会。我仍然记得一次管理会议。他们在**墨西哥城**北部经营一个非常大的压榨精炼设施。房间里一半的人是委内瑞拉人，他们才华横溢、聪明、受过教育，你知道，这种情况发生了。我知道，你知道，从我的社交媒体来看，这在很多西方公司都发生过。他们非常，我与委内瑞拉人合作的经验非常棒。他们有良好的教育体系，聪明，精通商业，我们很高兴地在世界各地重新雇佣了他们。

**Jeff Kasin**: It happened all the time. First, I want to set the scene, right? We have a um at the time we had an office in Caracus. Very nice, right? A lot of employees there, not just kind of because we have we had a brand business, right? We had people that were, you know, label designers and I mean it was the fullon think of it I don't know more of maybe the Proctor and G the retail side of things. So big office, nice um we had, you know, satellite communications there. There was no Starlink yet. Um and so the office was a nice place, right? And people actually, you know, they're like, "Oh yeah, I was there on Saturday." And I'm like, you know, and the problem is is when you left that office, you zipped to your gated community, more likely an apartment complex. Um you you just had to go from secured compound to secured compound. And then it became, you know, you didn't know if you were having water that week or hot water. You might not have electricity for several days. Um, you might not have access, there might not be anything to buy in a grocery store. Um, now our employees were getting some food from us because we made some basics, right? You know, every week we would make sure that we got something transferred from the plants and and put this stuff together. So the life um style that people lived was not easy even for those that theoretically had you know were well educated, had good jobs and eventually um even our business of course the the business is slowing down um and they leave. Um and then of course in our case we had a plant that got uh nationalized at gunpoint. Well, if you're, you know, a highly skilled manager operator, you don't want to stick around and start to have to do your job at gunpoint, right? Because they don't have any expertise in how to run the plant. So, the big wave, the first wave, the first, somebody said several million Venezuelans were the most educated, the most skilled, and it compounded itself, right? Because, you know, now nobody knows how to run the electric generation station, right? The nobody knows, you know, obviously the prochemical industry, right? you can go get reemployed around the world, you know, if you're a, you know, a pro engineer, no problem. And so those people went all over the place. And the beauty of working for a multinational is we picked up as many as we could. And that is, you know, in that conversation to bring, you know, you have an employee they call, they're they're very nationalistic, they know they're doing important work, they've had enough, and you get that call and they go, you know, they're they're they it's kind of sheepish. They're like, they feel like they're abandoning you. And you know, we go and find them. And my story was, you know, employee, one of my last employees just says, "I'm I'm going to Mexico City." Um, I think his wife had was working for Sony at the time and had some type of employment. And I said, "What are you going to do?" And he goes, "I don't know, but I'm not going to be here anymore." you know, I mailed my I mailed my big screen TV and a couple things DHL and I'm going to take my guitars on the plane and I'm done. And I said, "Well, I know what you're going to do. You're going to go to this address and you're going to work for me in Mexico." And that played out hundreds of times inside my employer. Um, you'd go to a meeting uh in Mexico City. I still remember a management meeting. They run a very large crush refine facility north of Mexico City. And half the half the people in the room are Venezuelans, talented, smart, educated, and that, you know, that played out. I know, you know, from my social media, you know, that happened in lots of Western companies. They're very I my experience working with Venezuelans was it was fantastic. They had a good education system, smart, business savvy, and um we gladly remployed them around the world.

**Tracy Aloway**: 暂时回到委内瑞拉，我们已经听到了关于石油工业的所有数据，以及要大规模盈利地运输或销售石油所需的前期资本量。你目前对你们所从事的谷物领域的情况有什么了解？是否存在同样的观点，认为在盈利运营时期使用的所有基础设施，都需要大量的资本投入，才能让像**嘉吉**或全球食品公司家族这样的实体愿意重新进入该业务？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: Sticking with Venezuela for a moment and we've heard all the numbers about the oil industry and the amount of upfront capital it would take to sort of profitably begin shipping oil at scale or selling oil at scale. What is your understanding like right now of the equivalent within the realms that you're working in grains? Like is there the same ex sort of view that all the infrastructure that was being used during the days when it was working profitably would need a significant amount of capital for an entity like Cargill or the sort of family of global food companies to want to reenter that business.

### 重返委内瑞拉市场的条件

**Jeff Kasin**: 听着，我不是委内瑞拉专家。我们的业务实际上是关于供应链的教育和风险管理。我们与美国种植者做了很多工作。所以这有点像一次偶然的经历，把我带到了今天这里。我们确实知道，我们当时在努力维护工厂。这些是，但我确信有很多工作要做。我认为最重要的一点是，你必须有安全保障，对吧？你必须能够，你需要一些承诺，因为有很多公司在委内瑞拉损失了很多钱，对吧？因为他们拥有的资产，一旦你放弃那里的资产，即使是尝试封存它，所有东西都会被偷走。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Kasin**: Look, I am not a Venezuelan expert. Our business is actually in education and risk management around supply chains. Um and we do a lot of work with US growers. So this was a bit of an accidental experience to uh to from from what happened to to bring me here today. Um we do know we were struggling to keep the plants maintained. These are but there and I'm sure there's a lot of work that has to be done. I think the number one thing you have to have is security, right? You have to be able you're going to need some promises that there's a lot of companies that lost a lot of money in Venezuela, right? with the assets they had because the second you walk away from an asset there try to even say mothball it everything gets stolen.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Okay.

</details>

**Jeff Kasin**: 你不会指望你五年前关闭的工厂里还会剩下什么。你必须几次捍卫它，否则如果有人进去，你知道，在黑市上出售零件，然后把剩下的废品卖掉，因为废铁是用美元交易的。所以你不能指望会有什么，除非它是蜂蜜。你不能指望太多。我知道，随着国内局势恶化，那里又开始发生奇怪的事情。他们实际上不得不增加成品进口，因为你不能再在国内生产了，但仍然有需求，而且有汇款，对吧？和墨西哥一样，对吧？所以即使是那些留下的人，也有一些美元在流通。我知道，我们有一些员工谈论向他们在委内瑞拉的家人寄钱，现在可能更容易了，但那是通过**迈阿密**的银行连接和一些类似的东西。所以，我怀疑，是的，有大量的工作要做，但我不是当前情况的专家。我认为在基本必需品方面是可以做到的。那些工厂没有那么难。面粉厂，炼油厂。是的。你知道，如果全世界都下定决心，毫无疑问是可以做到的。我刚看到我们今天早上卖了价值3亿美元的石油。他们显然是去购买货币。还记得我们谈论货币稳定吗？显然，他们一定用了很多钱来购买我们的两种货币，并创造一个更稳定的汇率，这样经济才能浮动起来。所以，你知道，向现任政府致敬，因为显然有人在关注。但是的，这需要安全保障。这需要一些承诺和稳定，因为，你知道，你正在谈论将数亿美元投入到一个实际上这些投资都已损失的地方。我认为这对于跨国公司来说不会是一个容易的推销。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Kasin**: That you don't expect there's you walk into a plant that you shut down 5 years ago that there'll be anything there um you have to defend it a couple times otherwise if somebody's going to go in there and you know sell the parts in the black market and scrap the rest because scrap iron trades in dollars and um so you can't expect that there's unless the whatever it is is honey. Um, you can't expect much. And I know that there they were started strange again, strange things that happened as the domestic situation got worse. They actually had to increase imports of finished goods because you couldn't finish them in the country anymore, but there was still demand and you had remittances, right? Same with like Mexico, right? So, there is some dollars floating even into people that stayed. I know, you know, we had some employees that talk about sending money to their families in Venezuela and easier to do now probably, but that was, you know, the Miami banking connection and some things like that. So, um I suspect that there's yeah, tremendous amount of work, but I'm not an expert on the current situation. I think it can be done in the basic staples. Those plants are not that hard. Flower mills, oil refineries. Yeah. You know, there's no doubt if the world put their mind to it. And I just saw we sold $300 million worth of oil here this morning. They went apparently to buy the currency. Remember we talked about currency stabilization. Apparently, they must have used a lot of that to buy both of ours and create a more stable exchange so you can get the economy floating. So, you know, hats off to the current administration for somebody's obviously paying attention. But yeah, it's going to take security. It's going to take some promises, stability, because, you know, you're talking about putting hundreds of millions of dollars on the ground into an place where effectively those those type of investments were lost. And I don't think that's going to be an easy sell to the multinational world.

</details>

### 物流与安全挑战

**Tracy Aloway**: 在委内瑞拉境内运输货物是怎样的？因为你描述了一个空工厂会很快被洗劫一空。我想如果人们看到机会，比如一卡车有价值的东西在路上，他们可能也会抓住这个机会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: What was it like just moving stuff within Venezuela? Because you describe how an empty plant would uh would be gutted fairly quickly. I imagine if people saw an opportunity uh you know a truckload of something that could be valuable um on the road they probably seized on that as well.

</details>

**Jeff Kasin**: 是的，我的意思是这无关紧要。你知道，委内瑞拉，我们有为我们工作的安全专家，他们了解在当地需要做什么来完成运输，比如从港口到工厂，或者从工厂到杂货店，或者某种分销。这非常困难。我最近的经验是，你认为这种情况不会发生，但在墨西哥，我们损失了很多卡车。有时我们会找回卡车。有时我们连货物带卡车都丢了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Kasin**: Yeah. I mean it doesn't matter. You know Venezuela was you know we had um security experts that work for us that understood what they had to ground you know do on the ground to get shipments like say from the port to the plant or from the plant to a to a grocery store right or something like that or some kind of distribution. Very it's very difficult. My more recent You think this doesn't go on and in Mexico, you know, we were losing a lot of trucks. Sometimes we'd get the trucks back. Sometimes we lost the cargo and the trucks.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 嗯，这种情况今天仍然存在。你坐在那里，试图理解做生意的成本是多少，对吧？你会在路上损失一些东西。有时你会雇佣当地公司，他们更有能力处理如何将货物从A点运到B点，你实际上必须在你的院落内工作。你还必须确保院落内的防盗安全，对吧？当你陷入这些情况时，经济就会受到所有这些拖累，对吧？恶性通货膨胀正在拖垮整个国家。我想如果你研究过，你知道，**Mike**和我都拥有一些经济学学位。所有这些都在拖累人们，你知道，你的员工今天拿到工资，他们一拿到工资就跑出去花掉，就像他们今天的工作已经完成了一样，对吧？“鞋底税”，对吧？现在所有东西都必须用多重围栏和带刺铁丝网以及持续的警卫和卡车上的警卫等等来保护。如果你能消除经济中的这种负担，那将是对经济的巨大推动。**Mike**和我正在关注**阿根廷**的情况。我喜欢去那里，那是一个美丽的地方，强烈推荐。但，你知道，让我们看看情况如何发展，因为它感觉这个国家正在开始摆脱一些束缚。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Um that still goes on right today. And you sit there and try to understand what is the cost of doing business, right? And you will lose some along the way. And um sometimes you h you hire local companies that are more able to navigate how to get things moved from point A to point B and you effectively have to work from inside your compound. You also have to secure uh from theft right at the compound, right? It's just all these drags on the economy when you get into these situations, right? It's just dragging the entire country down in hyperinflation. I think if you studied in, you know, Mike and I both have some economics degrees. Um, there's all these dragging taxes on people, you know, your employee gets paid today and they just as soon as they get paid, they run out and spend it like they're done for the rest of the day, right? The shoe leather tax, right? And and you know, now everything has to be secured with, you know, multi-fences and barb wire and constant guards and guards and trucks and all that stuff. And if you can remove that burden from the economy, it's just a huge, you know, you know, in, you know, boost to the economy. Mike and I are, you know, watching things in Argentina. Uh, I love going there. It's a beautiful place and highly recommend. Um, but, you know, let's see how that goes because it feels like the the country is starting to lose some of those shackles.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: **Tracy**，我给你一个警告。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: Tracy, I just have a warning to you, by the way.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 专门给我？好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: To me specifically. Okay.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 是的。你不会喜欢的。我一直在看**CBS**的节目《**地主**》（Land Man），所以当我们做商品节目时，我会开始引用很多我观察到的东西。但其中一个主题，一个很早的故事情节，就是卡车消失（因为卡特尔偷走了它们），然后一个月后神奇地重新出现，而且不值得问任何问题，因为那样你就要让**FBI**介入等等。所以，**Jeff**说的卡车突然回来的想法，我非常熟悉，因为我是电视观众。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: Yeah. You're not going to like it. I've been watching the show Land Man on CBS and so when we do commodity episodes I'm going to make a start referencing a lot of things that I observe but one of the themes is one of the plot lines very early on is the is the phenomenon of both trucks that disappear because the cartels still them and then magically reappear a month later and it's not worth asking any questions because then you have to get the FBI involved and etc. So, uh, that the idea what, uh, what Jeff was saying about the truck suddenly coming back is something that, um, I'm I'm familiar with because I'm a viewer of TV.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 站在电视机前。我要为所有的土地做好准备。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Stood up by the television. I'm going to steal myself for all the land.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 是的，你会看到很多，尤其是在我们做石油节目的时候。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: Yeah, you're going to get a lot, especially when we do oil episodes.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah.

</details>

### 乌克兰战后农业现状

**Tracy Aloway**: **Mike**，请你谈谈你对乌克兰现在和战前情况的看法。显然，现在仍然有小麦流出，但我们已经讨论了损害等等。损害的规模是怎样的？乌克兰的产出水平如何？请你谈谈你对现在和2021年底情况的看法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: Um, Mike, uh, talk to us the, uh, give us sort of your sense of Ukraine now and versus before the war. And obviously there's still weed flowing out, but we've talked about the impairments, etc. what is the sort of scale of the impairment and the damage etc and what sort of levels are coming out of Ukraine and sort of give us your sense of where things are these days versus at the end of uh 2021.

</details>

**Mike Rolson**: 当然。我再说一遍，我说的和**Jeff**说的差不多。我虽然不在那里，但我与很多仍在大规模耕作的朋友关系密切，他们正在努力让自己的工作取得成功。我想我会从一个你肯定听过的主题开始，那就是他们是令人难以置信的坚韧不拔的人。他们以前也经历过类似的事情，也许不是这一代人，但肯定在不远的过去。无论是**大饥荒**还是后苏联时期的局面，以及随之而来的一些饥饿，然后是**第一次世界大战**和**第二次世界大战**。所以，这在他们的过去中并不遥远，他们正在以一种相对简化的方式解决问题。我认为与粮食方面相关的两个最大变化是简化。所以，他们不再种植一些更复杂或更昂贵的作物，比如向日葵和玉米，而是更多地回归小麦、大麦等基本作物。就是说，在不确定的时候，就种这些，看看春天能不能收成。人力资本问题现在是一个巨大的问题。他们，你知道，仅仅是找到能够成为你工作团队一员的人，无论是开卡车、开联合收割机和拖拉机，还是监督粮仓运营，都非常非常困难。然后，正如我之前提到的，一些主要的出口枢纽要么被损坏，要么完全被摧毁，要么因为它们相对于当前的战线位置而被扰乱。但他们仍在艰难前行。你知道，说实话，我有点惊讶于粮食的总产量。只是作物组合发生了变化。出口方向也发生了变化，当然，这最终改变了生产者获得的**价格**。所以，我敢肯定他们做得不是特别好，但他们，你知道，值得称赞的是，他们仍在努力奋斗。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Rolson**: Sure. And and again I'm going to I'm going to say something fairly similar to what Jeff is. I'm not as on the ground there though I'm very close with a lot of friends that are still farming at scale and uh and trying to make whatever it is they're doing uh work. I I would I would sort of start off with a a theme I'm sure you've heard that you know they're incredibly resilient people. They've been through similar things like this before and perhaps not this generation but certainly in the not too distant past. U whether it be the halommore and you know postsviet uh situation and uh and and some of the starvation that came out of that and then the the world wars one and two and so it isn't like it's that distant in in in their past and they're figuring it out in a in a relatively simplified way. And and I think that the the the the two biggest changes as it pertains to the grain side is a a simplification. So instead of some of the more complex to grow or expensive to grow crops like sunflowers and corn, um they're pivoting more back to the basics of of wheat and and barley and and and things like that that just when in doubt, put that out there and and and see if we can get at it in the spring. the human the human capital piece is is an enormous problem right now. They you know just to find people that can can be part of your work teams whether it be driving the trucks or driving the combines and tractors and or or overseeing the grain elevator operations is is really really hard. And and then as I alluded to earlier, the some of the main horsepower export points have either been damaged or eliminated entirely or disrupted in terms of them being kind of grazed to where they're located relative to this this current, you know, uh fighting front, sort of where it's located. But they're limping along. And you know, I I I I've been kind of surprised to be honest with you, the total amount of grain that's been grown. It's just the mix has changed. the directions through which they're exported are changed and and certainly that that ultimately changes the price that comes back to the producer there. So, I'm sure they're not doing particularly well, but they're, you know, to their credit, they're still uh they're still giving it a a hard swing.

</details>

### 小麦出口的优势

**Tracy Aloway**: 很快问一下，我今天想学一件事，小麦有什么特点，使其比玉米更容易加工和出口？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: Just real quickly, so a thing I would like to learn today, what is it about wheat that makes it a sort of simpler crop to process and export than uh corn?

</details>

**Mike Rolson**: 嗯，种子的成本明显更低。所需的肥力也明显更低，你知道，在他们的世界里，每英亩或每公顷的成本。另一个在该地区具有偶然支持作用的因素是，那里的有机质和土壤的肥沃程度令人难以置信。所以你可以用小麦这样强度较低的农作物来种植，仍然能获得相当不错的收成。这就是那里的情况。小麦也相当容易回收利用作为种子，而其他作物则不那么直接。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Rolson**: Well, the the the seed is is materially uh less expensive. The the fertility required is is is materially less expensive, you know, per acre in their world world, per hectare. The other thing that's just circumstantially uh supportive in that part of the world is the the organic matter and the the the richness of the soil there is is incredible. So you can kind of get away with it with with lesser intensive aggronomic crops like wheat to to still ek out a pretty darn good crop. So that's the the the circumstance there. It's also fairly easy to recycle your wheat and you utilize it as seed uh where that's not as straightforward with with other crops.

</details>

### 给跨国公司的建议

**Tracy Aloway**: 我还有最后一个问题，这是给你们两位的，但你们对一家正在考虑进入委内瑞拉或战后乌克兰等市场进行扩张的跨国公司，有什么主要的建议或信息？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: I have one last question and this is to both of you, but what would be your major piece of advice or message to a multinational company that's considering either, you know, maybe they're looking at Venezuela and going, there's an opportunity there. I want in. Or maybe they're thinking about post-war Ukraine and expansion there. What would you tell those companies?

</details>

**Jeff Kasin**: 嗯，我的意思是，如果你打算进入这些地方，你必须具备一些专业知识。所以，如果你自己没有，你需要找到它，并找到你信任的人。安全将是你的首要任务，然后，你知道，从小生意开始，对吧？学习事情实际是如何运作的。我们以前常常从饲料厂开始。它们相对来说，你可以建一个**凯撒**（Kaiser）牌的，相对较小的便携式饲料厂，然后开始学习事情在当地是如何运作的。我们有数百个故事，我们收购了企业，即使我们已经在那里了，也以为我们知道发生了什么，结果在第一天就发现，“哦，你知道，你没有，你应该向肉类检查员行贿”之类的。所以，我的建议是，找到一个你可以用合理投资在那里经营的小生意，并将其视为学习曲线，或者学习，你知道，在投入并进行那些大的硬资本资产投资之前，先支付学费。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Kasin**: Well, I mean, you have to have some expertise if you're going to go into these places. So, if you don't have it with you, you need to find it and find people you trust. Security is going to be your number one part of it and start, you know, start with a small uh business, right? To learn how things actually work. We used to start with feed mills. They're rel you can put up a Kaiser, relatively small portable feed mills, and start to learn how things actually work on the ground. We have hundreds of stories where we bought businesses, thought we knew what was going on even after we'd been there, only to find up on first day that, oh, you know, you weren't you you're supposed to pay a bribe to the meat inspector or something like that. So, my advice is find a small business that you can run there with a reasonable investment and treat that as a learning curve or learn, you know, paying tuition before you jump in and uh make it uh make those big uh hard capital asset investments.

</details>

**Mike Rolson**: 是的，乌克兰的情况略有不同。我认为蓝图是存在的，如果你看看90年代后期粮食业务的辉煌时期，当时基础设施以一种服务全球市场并增加大量附加值加工的方式真正重建起来。在2005年、2006年、2008年左右，有大量的投资。所以蓝图是存在的。我只是认为这需要，你知道，坚韧不拔的人，耐心，努力维持你的团队，在他们个人决定（为了他们的安全、为了他们的家庭、为了任何事情）的现实中。你只需要在可预见的未来顺应这种潮流，看看这一切如何发展。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Rolson**: Yeah, and Ukraine has slightly different context. I think the blueprint is there is if you look at the the the I would kind of describe the glory days of of of the grain business in the late uh 90s when the infrastructure really got built back back up in in a way that served the global markets with a lot of value added processing. Tremendous amount of investment that went through the thes you know probably 05 068 right around there. So the blueprint is there. I I just think it's going to take, you know, resilient people uh patients uh attempting to maintain your teams uh there within the reality of of of the things that are going to be personal decisions for them, for their safety, for their family, for [music] whatever. Um you're just going to have to go with that flow for the foreseeable future and see how this all plays out.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 好的，**Mike**和**Jeff**，非常感谢你们来到《**Odd Lots**》。这太引人入胜了。我们本可以再聊一两个小时，听你们讲述在这些地方做生意的所有故事，但我们不得不就此打住。所以，非常感谢。

We could go on for another hour or two or three and listen to all your stories um of doing business in [music] these places, but we're going to have to leave it there. So, thank you so much.

### 总结与反思

**Tracy Aloway**: **Joe**，这非常有趣，既从农业角度，也显然从委内瑞拉和乌克兰的角度。让我印象深刻的一点是，大型跨国公司在进入新市场时会联合起来，因为这样更容易在他们习惯的法律和文化层面上运作。这真的很有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: Joe, that was super interesting both from an agricultural perspective and then obviously Venezuelan and Ukrainian perspective. One thing that stood out to me was this idea of large companies, multinationals coming together when they enter a new market like that because it becomes easier to operate, I guess, at the legal and cultural level that they're used to. That was really interesting.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的，我完全没有想到这一点。所以，这就像全球跨国公司，即使抛开法律不谈，他们也有某些你理所当然会期望的规范。所以**雀巢**的人和，我不知道，随便什么人交谈，他们会说：“哦，我们这里有批货。”他们或多或少可以期望那个实体会这样做，对吧？而且不需要太多的翻译或其他。所以，这个想法非常重要，这是我以前没有想到的。另外，关于这一点，即使我们自己也在一家大型跨国公司工作，我也思考过，大型公司就像，我们称它们为跨国公司，但它们本身也像国家一样。想想看，当你从**纽约**搬到**阿布扎比**，再到**香港**，然后又回到**纽约**时，有一个团队会协助所有这些签证之类的流程。当他描述员工在办公室比在家里更舒服的现象时，我就想到了这一点。就像在这种环境下，公司办公室就像一个，我想你会说，发达世界的轻松和舒适的口袋，对吧？而当你离开办公室的那一刻，你就离开了那个环境。然后你突然不得不担心电力。然后你不得不担心自来水和安全。大型公司如何在内部创建这些跨国界的、但在不同国家的不同办公室之间都相同的安全和法律环境。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah, I hadn't thought about that at all. Right. So, it's like global multinationals even setting aside law, you know, they have certain norms you just sort of expect and so someone from Nestle talks to someone from I don't know what whatever and they're like, "Oh, we have a shipment here at this time." And they can more or less expect that that entity will do that, right? And without too much translation or whatever. And so, the idea that that is really important is something I hadn't thought of. Also on this and it's something I've thought about even working working at a large multinational ourselves is this way that like large companies are sort of we call them multinationals but they're also like nations unto themselves in this sense like think about the fact that when you move from New York to Abu Dhabi to Hong Kong and back to New York that there is a team that facilitates all of these processes of like visas and stuff like that and so forth and Like and I thought about that when he described the phenomenon of the workers being more comfortable in the office than back home. That like the the the corporate office in this environment is like this like pocket of sort of I guess you would say developed world ease and comfort, right? And that the moment you leave that office you are out of that. Then you suddenly have to worry about electricity. Then you sort of have to worry about maybe running water and security and how big companies sort of create these security and legal environments within themselves that are these like crossborder pockets but that will be the same from one office to another regardless of what country they're operating in.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 是的，绝对是。我还在思考委内瑞拉的货币问题。我的意思是，你可能会认为，随着与美国建立新的关系，获取美元可能会容易一些，但听到**Jeff**讲述他们为了获取美元而变得多么有创意，真是令人着迷。例如，他们试图出口木制托盘来换取美元等等。我基本上是在以物易物，对吧？是的，听起来基本上就是以物易物，或者说这里有一些可以使用的盐袋。然后你就会遇到这个问题，那就是你拥有这个国家的所有人才。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: Yeah, absolutely. The other thing that I was thinking about was the currency question when it comes to Venezuela. I mean, you would assume with maybe this new relationship with the US, access to dollars maybe will get a a little bit easier, but it was fascinating to hear from Jeff just how creative they got when it came to securing dollars. So, for instance, you know, trying to export wooden pallets in exchange for US currency and things like that. I basically bartering, right? Yeah, it does sound like it basically comes down to borrow bartering or like here are some sacks of salt that can be used and then you have this issue which is that you can have all of the talent on the country.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 尽管在很多情况下，其中大部分人才已经离开了，但你拥有所有这些人才，拥有所有这些原材料，但你需要一个零件，你需要它来自某个先进的工业零件专业制造商，用于炼油厂或其他什么，而这由一家欧洲跨国公司出售，你需要硬通货来购买。所以，你无法绕开这个事实，那就是真正的自给自足非常罕见。世界上几乎不存在这样的情况，只要有一个组件，当然我们知道这就是**中国**正在努力解决的问题。他们希望拥有整个供应链的每一个环节。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Although much of it's left in in many of these cases but you have all this talent and you have all this raw commodities but you need a part and you need it from some advanced specialty maker of an industrial part for refinery or whatever and that's sold by a European multinational and you need hard currency for that and So there is no getting around this fact that like true self-sufficiency is very rare. It almost doesn't exist anywhere in the world so long as any one component and of course we know this is what China is trying to solve for. They want to have every.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 内部的各个方面，这样他们就不会因为无法获得某个零件而导致整个行业停滞不前。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: Aspect of the entire supply chain inhouse such that there is no possibility of them not being able to access one part and grinding a whole industry to a halt.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的。好吧。我们可以继续聊，但我们是不是就到这里？就到这里吧。
