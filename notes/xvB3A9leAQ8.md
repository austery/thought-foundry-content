<p class="english-text">But there's just so much going on.</p>
</details>

Tracy Aloway: 我认为你提到了几个点，会议中有不同的主题。显然，人们对关税对经济的实际影响存在不确定性。它们属于哪种冲击？它们会摧毁需求从而可能导致通货紧缩，还是会导致企业转嫁成本从而引发通货膨胀？还有央行独立性，这是每个人都想谈论的，以及短期利率的走向。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I think you're hitting on a couple things, which is there are these different themes floating through the conference. So you have uncertainty over what tariffs actually do to the economy. What type of shock are they? Do they destroy demand and therefore maybe cause deflation or do they lead to companies passing on those costs and cause inflation? There's central bank independence which everyone wants to talk about and there's the direction of short-term interest rates</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal: 当然，还有会议的正式主题，关于劳动力市场等等。所以，是的，有很多不同的事情正在发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then of course the formal theme of the conference about labor markets and all this stuff. So yes, many different things going on.</p>

### 泰勒规则的起源与演变：从描述到规范

Emmy Nakamura: 1993年，约翰·泰勒（John Taylor）写了一篇论文，他在其中展示了**美联储**（Federal Reserve: 美国中央银行体系）的行为可以用一个非常简单的规则来描述，这个规则是通货膨胀和人们所说的**产出缺口**（Output Gap: 经济实际产出与潜在产出之间的差异，衡量经济过热或疲软程度）的函数。这让人们非常惊讶，因为人们通常认为美联储和其他中央银行所做的事情极其复杂。所以，令人惊讶的是，你可以用非常简单的东西来描述它。自1993年约翰·泰勒撰写他的原始论文以来，泰勒规则在经济学界和政策制定领域或多或少地获得了神话般的地位。最初的论文主要是描述性的，它指出美联储看似复杂的行为实际上可以用非常简单的东西来描述。但从那时起，它真正成为规范性货币政策的指南。当中央银行偏离泰勒规则时，它们经常被要求解释原因，例如，在后疫情时代的通货膨胀中，这是一个主要主题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, in 1993, John Taylor wrote a paper in which he showed that the behavior of the Federal Reserve could be described by this remarkably simple rule as a function of inflation and what people call the output gap, which is a measure of how overheated the economy is. And this was very surprising to people because people typically think of what the Federal Reserve and other central banks do as incredibly complicated. And so the surprise was that you could actually describe it by something very simple. And since that time when John Taylor wrote his original paper in 1993, the Taylor rule has achieved more or less mythical status within economics and the policym world. The original paper was mostly descriptive. It was pointing out that the behavior of the Fed, which seemed complicated, could actually be described by something really simple. But since then, it's really become a guide for prescriptive monetary policy. And when central banks deviate from the Taylor rule, they're often asked to explain why this was a major theme in the postcoid inflation.</p>
</details>

Tracy Aloway: 谈到这一点，我能问一下为什么是泰勒规则吗？也许可以告诉我们这些论文在杰克逊霍尔会议之前是如何形成的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So on that note, could I ask why the Taylor rule specifically and talk to us maybe about the process of how these papers come into being ahead of Jackson Hole?</p>
</details>

Emmy Nakamura: 为什么我们写关于泰勒规则的论文？正如我所说，泰勒规则不仅在货币政策的学术文献中，而且在政策界都获得了极其主导的地位。然而，当我教学生时，有一点让我感到不安，那就是泰勒规则在过去20年中并不完全适用。它在格林斯潘时期直到2008年左右在美国都适用得很好，但从那以后就不是很好。首先，有**零利率下限**（Zero Lower Bound: 指名义利率不能低于零的限制，限制了中央银行在经济衰退时通过降低利率来刺激经济的能力）时期，当时利率就是零。但它也没有很好地预测从零利率水平上调的时机和幅度。所以，考虑到20年已经是很长一段时间了，问题是我们是否仍然应该将其视为描述货币政策的基准？然后还有第二个问题，关于如何看待良好的货币政策。当约翰·泰勒写他的原始论文时，它主要是一篇描述性论文，但他确实指出这是一个时期。他说的时期实际上只有六年，从1987年到1992年。但他指出，这是一个很多人认为代表良好货币政策的时期。所以，虽然这篇论文主要是描述性的，但他确实说，这也许也是良好货币政策的指南。从那时起，很多人都采纳了这个主题。我们认为重新审视这个主题很重要。但这很有趣，对吧？因为描述性还是规范性之间存在这种张力。多年来，我一直听到电视上的人说：“哦，泰勒规则说它应该高得多，或者泰勒规则说它应该低一些，等等。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why we wrote about the Taylor rule? Well, as I said, the Taylor rule has achieved this incredibly dominant status within not only the academic literature on monetary policy, but also within the policy community. And yet, when I teach students, one of the things that's somewhat uncomfortable is that the Taylor rule doesn't fit all that well over the past 20 years. So, it fit pretty well during the Greenspan period and all the way until about 2008 in the United States, but it hasn't fit very well since then. First of all, there was the zero lower bound period when interest rates were just at zero. But it also didn't predict very well either the timing or the magnitude of the liftoff from zero interest rates. So given that 20 years is starting to be a long time, the question is should we still view this as the benchmark for describing monetary policy? And then there's this second question about how to think about good monetary policy. So when John Taylor wrote his original paper, it was mostly descriptive paper, but he did point out that this was a time period. The time period he said was actually only 6 years. It was from 1987 to 1992. But he pointed out that this was a time period a lot of people thought of as representing good monetary policy. So while the paper was mostly descriptive, he did say, you know, well, maybe this is a guide to good monetary policy, too. And that's a theme that a lot of people have picked up on since then. And we thought it was important to sort of reinvestigate that theme. But this is funny, right? Like because there is this tension of whether it's a descriptive or prescriptive thing. And I've heard for years people on TV, it's like, "Oh, the Taylor rule says it should be a lot higher or the Taylor roll says it should be lower, whatever."</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal: 但我们刚刚从**堪萨斯城联储**（Kansas City Fed: 负责美国联邦储备系统第十区的联邦储备银行）的杰夫·施密特那里听到了同样的话，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But we just heard it from Jeff Schmidt at the Kansas Fed, right?</p>
</details>

Emmy Nakamura: 然而，这基本上都是基于对五年货币政策的倒推描述，也就是那六年。好的，抱歉，六年。也许不完全是。那么，您能多谈谈这种，我不知道这是否是一场辩论，或者人们如何看待这个规则中的规范性与描述性之间的关系。您所描述的这种张力正是我们撰写这篇论文的动机，因为它很有趣，一个像这样简单而强大的框架，在描述货币政策方面，确实说了一些关于货币政策应该如何应对通货膨胀和经济过热的真理，但它最终可能成为一个比作者最初意图更具规范性的规则。我们想提醒人们的是约翰·泰勒论文撰写时的历史背景。它写于1993年，当时美联储刚刚摆脱货币政策非常困难的几年。20世纪70年代和80年代是货币政策非常困难的时期。20世纪70年代末和80年代初通货膨胀非常高。美联储作为抗通胀者的声誉，至少可以说，是有限的。通胀预期远不如今天那么稳定。所以那是一个非常不同的时代，我认为约翰·泰勒论文的一些背景是说，当你面临那种声誉挑战时，有时你需要将自己束缚在一个桅杆上，并说我们不会遵循一个数学规则。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And yet this is all based on basically a sort of backing out description of five years of monetary policy that six year. Okay. Sorry. Six years. Maybe not quite. So can you talk a little bit more about though this I don't know if it's a debate or like how people think about prescriptive versus descriptive within this role. So the tension that you're describing is exactly what motivated us to write this paper because it's interesting how a framework like this which is so simple and so powerful in terms of describing monetary policy and does say some things that are very true about what monetary policy should do in terms of leaning against inflation, leaning against an overheating economy can end up becoming maybe more than even the author intended as a prescriptive rule. And one of the things that we want to remind people of is the historical context for when John Taylor's paper was written. So it was written in 1993. This was a period when the Fed was coming off some very difficult years for monetary policy. So the 1970s and 1980s were very difficult years for monetary policy. Inflation had been very high in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Fed's reputation was, to say the least, limited as an inflation fighter. inflation expectations were not nearly as anchored as they are today. So it was a very different time and I think some of the context for John Taylor's paper is saying that when you have those kinds of reputational challenges sometimes you kind of need to tie yourself to a mass and say we are not going by a mathematical rule.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal: 没错。因为20世纪70年代也是历史上以对美联储施加政治压力而闻名的一个时期。因此，在这种政治压力下，你想要考虑做的事情之一就是给人们一个非常简单、可观察的指标，来衡量你如何调整利率。但当然，几十年后，美联储的声誉已经发生了巨大变化。我们看到了几十年的低而稳定的通货膨胀，美联储和世界各地的其他中央银行确实已经建立了非常强大的抗通胀声誉。那么问题就来了，即使在像我们后疫情时代所看到的冲击背景下，这种束手束脚的方法是否仍然适用？所以，我认为这就是我们现在需要提出这些问题的原因。这让我想起了**货币规则**（Som Rule: 指的是货币政策应遵循预设的规则而非相机抉择，以提高政策透明度和可预测性）和相关的论点，如果你找到了一个具体的数字，那么理念就是你使用一个简单的公式，然后立即采取行动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Exactly. Because the 1970s are also one of the time periods in history which is best known for political pressure on the Fed. And so in the context of that kind of political pressure, one of the things you want to think about doing is giving people a very simple observable metric for how you adjust interest rates. But then of course by several decades later the Fed's reputation had changed pretty dramatically. We had seen decades of low and stable inflation and the Fed and other central banks around the world had really developed a very strong inflation fighting reputation. And so then the question arises is the same kind of tying your hands approach appropriate even in the context of shocks like what we saw after co and so this is the sense in which I think this is a time at which we want to ask these questions. It reminds me very much of the som rule and the arguments there that if you find like a specific number the idea is that you use a sort of simple formula and then you immediately jump into action.</p>

### 泰勒规则的局限性：通胀来源与政策响应

Joe Weisenthal: 谈到这一点，泰勒规则的一个关键点是它建议利率需要以高于通胀一比一的幅度上升，才能有效抵消通胀。也就是说，你必须非常非常强硬。但您在论文中发现情况并非总是如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So on that note, one of the key things about the Taylor rule is that it suggests rates need to rise by more than one for one with inflation to properly offset inflation. Like you have to go in very very strong. But you found in your paper that that's not always the case.</p>
</details>

Emmy Nakamura: 没错。所以，甚至超越了你想要将利率提高超过一比一的想法。在泰勒规则中，系数是1.5，但甚至超越了**泰勒原则**（Taylor Principle: 指中央银行在通胀上升时，应将名义利率提高超过通胀率的幅度，从而提高实际利率以抑制通胀）的理念，这正是你所描述的，你不仅要随着通胀提高名义利率，还要提高**实际利率**（Real Interest Rate: 经过通货膨胀调整后的利率，反映了资金的真实购买力）。如果你想提高实际利率，那么你必须将**名义利率**（Nominal Interest Rate: 未经通货膨胀调整的利率，是银行或金融机构公布的利率）提高超过一比一的幅度。正是你所说的。所以，这是一种核心理念，也是泰勒规则的规定与中央银行在疫情通胀期间实际行动之间差距如此之大的主要原因之一。实际上，对于美国来说，这个差距大约超过了10个百分点。所以我们谈论的是一个非常大的差距。疫情通胀期间出现了历史上最大的差距。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Exactly. So even beyond the idea that you want to raise interest rates more than one for one. So it's the coefficient is 1.5 in the Taylor rule, but there's the idea even beyond that of the Taylor principle, which is exactly what you described that you want to not only raise interest rates, nominal interest rates with inflation, but you want to raise real interest rates. And if you want to raise real interest rates, then you have to raise nominal interest rates more than one for one. Exactly what you said. And so that's kind of a core idea and it's one of the main reasons why the gap between the tailor rule prescription and what central banks actually did during the co inflation was so large. And actually for the United States this gap was about was over 10 percentage points. So we are talking about a very large gap. And the co inflation saw the largest gap in history.</p>
</details>

Emmy Nakamura: 那么，为什么在货币理论中，这种情况并非总是发生呢？原因在于通货膨胀有不同的来源。对通货膨胀采取强硬措施的动机，对大多数人来说可能相当直观，那就是**需求驱动型通胀**（Demand-Driven Inflation: 由总需求超过总供给导致的价格普遍上涨）。所以，当通货膨胀来自经济过热时，货币经济学中有一个观念，即通过积极提高利率，你可以同时实现平抑经济和控制通胀的目标。实际上，最优货币政策理论甚至暗示你可能希望比泰勒规则更激进。但相反，当通货膨胀的冲击并非直接来自经济过热，而是来自其他成本增加的来源，比如人们在疫情通胀时期谈论的**供给冲击**（Supply Shocks: 经济中供给侧发生的突然变化，如原材料价格上涨、自然灾害或生产中断，导致生产成本增加和物价上涨）时，这些模型可能会得出非常不同的预测。它们可能暗示，在应对与这类冲击相关的通货膨胀时，你不需要大幅提高利率。因此，在我们的论文中，我们使用了一个非常标准的货币模型，并模拟了该模型的数据，我们假设货币政策实际上是完全最优的。也就是说，中央银行确实做对了事情，然后我们进行回归分析，试图估计在这种情况下泰勒规则会得出什么结果，然后有趣的观察是，你发现很多时候通货膨胀的系数实际上小于1。有时它接近零，有时甚至为负。所以，当你仅仅偏离通货膨胀来自经济过热的观点时，很多事情都可能发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well the reason is because there are different sources of inflation. So the motivation for leaning hard against inflation that is probably pretty intuitive to most people is demand driven inflation. So when inflation is coming from an overheating economy, then there's this notion in monetary economics that you can satisfy all objectives of both kind of calming down the economy but also keeping inflation in check by raising interest rates pretty aggressively. And actually optimal monetary policy theory implies you might even be want to be more aggressive than the tailor rule. But in contrast, when you have shocks to inflation that don't come directly from an overheating economy, but also come from other sources of increases in costs, you know, so the supply shocks that people talked about during the co inflation period, then these same models can imply very different predictions. They can imply that you don't want to raise interest rates nearly so much in response to inflation associated with these kinds of shocks. So in our paper what we do is we use a very standard monetary model and we simulate data from this model where we assume that the monetary policy is actually exactly optimal. So the central bank is really doing the right thing and then we run regressions you know where we try to estimate what would what we get for the tailor rule in this context and then the interesting observation is that you find that actually a lot of times the coefficient on inflation is is is less than one. Sometimes it's close to zero sometimes it's even negative. So really a lot of things can happen when you deviate only from this view of inflation is coming from an overheating economy.</p>

### 美联储的后疫情时代表现与信誉

Joe Weisenthal: 美联储做得好吗？

<details>

<p class="english-text">Did the Fed do a good job?</p>
</details>

Tracy Aloway: 这篇论文读起来像是一种辩护。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The paper reads like vindication.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal: 是的，因为我认为到2025年，关于这个问题仍然会有很多争论。您的看法是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. like cuz I I think in 2025 there's still plenty of fights about this question. What's your take?</p>
</details>

Emmy Nakamura: 我认为，我们不知道未来会发生什么，但从历史的长河来看，如果你回顾过去五年发生的事情，我认为这将会是一次**软着陆**（Soft Landing: 指经济在抑制通货膨胀的同时避免陷入严重衰退的情况）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think in so we don't know what's going to happen going forward but I think in in the long span of history if you look at what happened over the past 5 years I think this is going to look like a soft landing</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal: 这通常正是美联储试图实现的目标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and that is typically exactly what the Federal Reserve is trying to achieve.</p>
</details>

Emmy Nakamura: 我的意思是，显然美联储和私人部门的预测者都因为说通货膨胀将是短暂的而受到了很多批评，当时通货膨胀持续的时间要长得多。尽管如此，通货膨胀确实很快下降了，而且没有发生经济衰退，这非常了不起。不仅没有发生经济衰退，通货膨胀下降得非常快，而且尽管通货膨胀历史性地飙升，长期通胀预期也确实没有失控。我们没有看到长期债券收益率大幅上升。所以这一切都非常了不起，我认为如果未来五年一切顺利，那么从历史的长河来看，这将是一次巨大的成功。所以，这就是**央行独立性**（Central Bank Independence: 指中央银行在制定和执行货币政策时，不受政府政治干预的程度）和信誉发挥作用的地方，尤其是在长期通胀预期方面。您在论文中是如何衡量信誉的？因为您不仅研究了美联储，还研究了许多其他中央银行，对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I mean obviously the Fed appropriately and and private sector forecasters took a lot of flack for saying that inflation was going to be very transitory when inflation was significantly more persistent. That said, inflation did come down very quickly and there hasn't been a recession and that is remarkable and not only has there not been a recession and not only did inflation come down very quickly, but longerterm inflation expectations really did not become unhinged despite this historic increase in inflation. We, you know, haven't seen large increases in longerterm bond yields. So this is all pretty remarkable and I would think that if if things go well over the next five years that in the longer span of history this is going to look like a big success. So this is where central bank independence and credibility actually comes into play when it comes to those longerterm inflation expectations. How did you actually measure credibility in this paper? Because you don't look just at the Fed, you look at a bunch of other central banks, right?</p>
</details>

### 央行信誉与全球通胀应对策略

Emmy Nakamura: 没错。所以当我们观察其他中央银行时，我们指出的一点是，不同的中央银行对疫情通胀的反应存在巨大的差异。我们一直在谈论美国，类似地，日本、英国、欧元区等国家都非常缓慢地提高了利率，而且相对于它们面临的通胀增幅来说，提高的幅度非常温和。因此，它们都因为加息过慢、落后于曲线、加息不足而受到了很多批评。在我们的论文中，我们将这些国家称为“迟行动者”（late risers），因为它们在应对上有点迟。但世界上还有其他国家，我们称之为“早行动者”（early risers），它们更积极、更早地提高了利率。有趣的观察是，你可能会认为“迟行动者”国家会因为在加息方面迟缓而遭受更高的通胀，而“早行动者”则积极应对。但实际上，我们发现情况恰恰相反。 “早行动者”确实对疫情通胀做出了非常积极的反应，但它们在此期间的通胀上升幅度却大得多。所以我们提出了一个问题：这如何解释？这似乎有些反常。这些国家似乎对利率做出了非常积极的反应，但它们却经历了更大、更持久的通胀飙升。但我们随后发现，这些国家有着更为坎坷的通胀历史。你问到声誉。那么，衡量中央银行控制通胀声誉的一个非常简单的方法就是看近几十年的平均通胀率。我们观察了过去三十年的平均通胀率，发现“早行动者”国家，也就是那些可能觉得必须对疫情通胀做出非常积极反应的国家，也有着更为坎坷的通胀历史。在疫情之前，它们过去三十年的平均通胀率要高得多。因此，我认为对这些事实的一个自然解释是，这些国家不认为它们拥有美国、日本或欧元区中央银行那样的抗通胀信誉。它们不认为它们拥有这些国家可以从中受益的、牢固锚定的通胀预期。因此，对于这些国家来说，认为它们可以忽视通胀但仍能保持通胀预期稳定，这可能根本不是一个选择。然而，这正是美国和其他一些“迟行动者”国家实际发生的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. So when we look at other central banks one of the things we point out is that there was a huge amount of variation in terms of how different central banks reacted to the co inflation. So we've been talking about the United States and similarly countries like Japan, the UK, the Euro area. These countries all raised interest rates very gradually and by very moderate amounts relative to the size of the inflation increases they were facing. And so they all took a lot of flack for raising interest rates too slowly, for behind the curve, for not raising interest rates enough. And these are the countries we refer to in our paper as late risers because they were a little late to the game, right? But there were other countries in the world we refer to to as early risers who raised interest rates a lot more aggressively and a lot earlier. And the interesting observation, you might have thought that these countries would have suffered from the fact the late riser countries would have suffered from the fact that they were late to the game in raising interest rates with having higher inflation than the early risers who responded very aggressively. And in fact, we find the opposite. So the early risers did respond very aggressively to the co inflation, but they actually saw inflation rise by a lot more during this episode. So then we ask the question, well, what could explain that? That seems sort of backwards. You know, you have these countries that seem to have responded very aggressively with interest rates and yet they saw the the larger and more persistent inflationary surges. But then what we see is that those same countries are countries that have much more checkered inflation histories. So you asked about reputation. Well, a very simple way to ask about the reputation of a central bank for controlling inflation is just to look at average inflation in in the recent decades. And so we look at average inflation over the previous three decades and we see that the early riser countries the ones that you know probably felt they had to respond very aggressively to the co inflation also had much more checkered inflation histories. had much higher average inflation over the past three decades previous to co. And so I think a natural interpretation of these facts is that for these countries they did not feel that they had the inflation fighting credibility of the central banks in the United States or in Japan or in the Euro area. They did not feel that they had the kind of strongly anchored inflation expectations that these countries could benefit from. And so for these countries it really probably was not an option to think that they could look through you know the inflation and yet keep inflation expectations anchored and but but yet that is actually what happened in in the United States and several other of these late riser countries.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal: 我觉得这非常引人入胜，我想问一个问题，就是发达市场或美国在过去五年中是否已经耗尽了其信誉储备，但我想先谈谈“早行动者”这个问题。我明白您说的，但我仍然觉得不直观，那些在控制通胀方面历史平庸的国家，这次却能步调一致地迅速行动。我的意思是，我会认为如果一个中央银行有未能达到通胀目标或任由通胀上升的历史，那么至少其中一些国家会再次这样做。它们会迟迟不行动，因为那是它们的制度惯例。那么，这种全球范围内的过程，即那些有不良记录的国家这次却成为“早行动者”，其一致性如何？

<details>

<p class="english-text">So I find this to be really fascinating and I want to get to the question of like whether the developed market or the US has like ground down its stock of credibility over the last 5 years but I wanted on this question of the early risers. I get what you're saying, but it's still not intuitive to me that the countries or the central banks with a sort of mediocre history of controlling inflation this time around were really on the ball in unison. I mean, I would think that if a central bank has a history of missing its inflation target or letting inflation rise that at least some of them would have done it again. They would have like come in late because that's what they do institutionally. like how consistent is this process around the world whereby the countries that have a bad track record were early risers this time around</p>

Emmy Nakamura: 没错，我们并没有包括所有国家，所以有一些国家在应对和通胀方面是异常值，但我认为你必须认识到的一点是，在整个世界范围内，中央银行在抗击通胀方面取得了相当显著的胜利。回到20世纪70年代和80年代，几乎所有国家都像我们今天看到的“早行动者”一样。所以这些国家都没有真正强大的抗通胀资质。而最近，许多国家正朝着拥有更强大抗通胀资质的方向发展，但与此同时，这些国家的历史相对较新。你知道，你看看其中一些国家，它们过去曾有相当高的通胀。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Right so we're not including every country so there are some countries which are outliers in terms of their response in terms of their inflation but I think one of the things you have to recognize is that in the world as a whole there has been quite a remarkable sort of triumph of central banks over inflation so back in the 1970s and 1980s almost every country was like what we see in the early risers today. So none of these countries had really strong credentials as inflation fighters. And more recently there are a number of these countries which are kind of moving in the direction of having much stronger inflation fighting credentials but at the same time you know these are countries where it's a relatively fresh history. You know so you look at some of these countries where they had pretty high inflation in the past</p>

Emmy Nakamura: 而且你知道，它们才刚刚开始能够克服它。然后问题是，你认为公众是否愿意看着你经历一个比如说10%通胀的时期，然后说：“哦，我们相信你会把它降回到2%。”或者你认为，会有一个真正的问题，就是你是否能够实现这个目标？

Or do you think, you know, there's going to be a real question of whether you're going to be able to achieve that?</p>

### 央行信誉的益处：最优政策与前瞻性指引

Joe Weisenthal: 好的。那么，另一方面，如果你确实拥有良好的信誉，你确实有良好的抗通胀历史，那么你就可以利用这种社会资本，避免像其他没有这种信誉的中央银行那样大幅提高利率。请您详细说明一下不这样做的好处是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So if on the other hand you do have good credibility, you do have a good history of inflation fighting, then you can kind of spend that social capital I guess and avoid having to raise interest rates by as much as you know maybe another central bank that doesn't have that credibility. Walk us through what exactly are the benefits of not having to do that</p>

</details>

Emmy Nakamura: 绝对是。嗯，你会更接近最优货币政策。所以在模型中，基本思想是，例如，如果你遇到这种**成本推动型冲击**（Cost-Push Shocks: 指由于生产成本增加（如工资、原材料价格上涨）导致总供给减少，从而引起物价上涨和经济产出下降的现象），即由于成本增加或各种瓶颈，或者像疫情期间人们对商品而非服务的需求冲击，直接导致通货膨胀。如果你像泰勒规则可能预测的那样大幅提高利率，将利率提高到10%。那么，为了在短期内将通货膨胀降至零，会发生什么呢？嗯，也许你会经历一场大的衰退。你将不得不让经济的一部分完全崩溃。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely. Well, you get closer to optimal monetary policy. So in the models the basic idea is for example if you have one of these cost push shocks where there's a shock that is going directly to inflation because of increases in costs or bottlenecks of various types or or you have a shock like during COVID to people's demand for goods versus services. If you raise the interest rate dramatically like the tailor rule might have predicted you raise the interest rate to 10%. So what's going to have to happen to get inflation down to zero in the short run? Well maybe you're going to have to have a big recession. You're gonna have to have one part of the economy completely collapse.</p>

</details>

Emmy Nakamura: 可能会。你将不得不让经济的某些部门出现非常负面的通货膨胀，你将不得不经历一场大的衰退，而且潜在地，另一个问题是，有很多证据表明货币政策具有相当滞后的效应。所以另一个担忧是，正如我所说，在这次事件中，专业预测者和美联储都认为通货膨胀会比实际情况更短暂。但另一个担忧是，如果你认为导致通货膨胀的冲击会自行消散，并且你认为货币政策需要一些时间才能产生效果，那么一个担忧是，当货币政策真正产生巨大效果时，其中一些冲击可能已经消散了。然后我想我要提到的第三件事是，理论上，中央银行实际上希望结合使用当前的利率变动和**前瞻性指引**（Forward Guidance: 中央银行通过公开声明其未来货币政策意图，以影响市场预期和长期利率的沟通策略）。这是近几十年来货币政策的一大创新。我们在**零利率下限**（Zero Lower Bound: 指名义利率不能低于零的限制，限制了中央银行在经济衰退时通过降低利率来刺激经济的能力）的背景下，经常考虑前瞻性指引，因为你无法对联邦基金利率做任何事情，所以一切都围绕着前瞻性指引，但实际上前瞻性指引是一个更普遍的现象。它实际上是中央银行在预测未来一年甚至更长时间的利率走势。这在疫情通胀飙升期间非常重要，因为美联储开始谈论加息，长期债券收益率在2021年末开始迅速上升，这比联邦基金利率实际开始迅速上升早得多。在理论上，一个拥有这种力量的中央银行，它不仅通过联邦基金利率的行动，而且通过其言论及其对债券市场的影响，来影响经济，它会希望同时使用这两种工具。所以，这是不受这些限制束缚的另一个优势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">probably. You're gonna have to have really negative inflation in some sectors of the economy and you're going to have to be have a big recession and potentially, you know, the other issue is that there's a lot of evidence suggesting that monetary policy has pretty delayed effects. So another concern and as I said, you know, in this episode professional forecasters and the Fed both thought that the inflation would be more transitory than it actually was. But another concern is if you think that the shocks that are causing the inflation are sort of going to dissipate on their own and you think the monetary policy has going to take some time to have an effect then one of the concerns is that by the time the monetary policy actually has a large effect then you know some of these shocks are going to dissipate. And then I guess the third thing I I would mention is that in theory the central bank actually wants to use a combination not only of current interest rate movements but also of forward guidance. So this is one of the big innovations in monetary policy over recent decades. We think about forward guidance a lot in the context of the zero lower bound when you can't do anything with you know Fed funds rate and so it's all about forward guidance but actually forward guidance is a much much more general phenomenon. It's really whenever the central bank is calling it shots about what it's going to do with interest rates even over the next year. So this was hugely important during the co inflationary surge because the Fed started talking about raising interest rates and longer term bond yields started rising pretty rapidly in late 2021 substantially before the Fed funds rate actually started to rise rapidly. And in in the in the theory, a central bank that has that power, it has the ability to affect the economy, not just through what it does with the Fed funds rate, but also through its words and the impact on the bond market through that channel will actually want to use both. And so that's another advantage of not being bound by these kinds of constraints.</p>

### 通胀预期与央行信誉的演变

Joe Weisenthal: 这对我来说是一个极其重要的观点，那就是你可以通过谈论事情来收紧货币政策。所以，仅仅通过观察隔夜利率，泰勒规则可能预测的等等，并不一定能捕捉到当时的货币政策立场，如果你已经有所指示并提前进行了加息。那么，我们今天的信誉是否下降了呢？好的，也许美联储这次做得很好。尽管如此，还是发生了这次非常大的通胀事件。所以，在多年的低通胀之后，我们终于迎来了一次大的通胀。这是否意味着下一次，如果由于某种原因再次发生通胀冲击，美联储可能会被迫比这次周期中更早地采取行动？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This strikes me as an incredibly important point, which is that you can tighten monetary policy by talking about stuff. So that just by looking at that overnight rate that the rule might anticipate etc does not necessarily capture the stance of monetary at that time if you're already indicated and you're pulling forward those rate hikes. So do we have less credibility today you know so okay maybe the Fed did a good job in this time. Nonetheless there was this very big inflationary episode etc. So after years of very cool inflation finally we got a big one going forward. Does that mean the next time around if there is another inflationary shock for whatever reason that the Fed might be impelled to be more of an early riser than it felt in this cycle?</p>
</details>

Emmy Nakamura: 我认为几乎肯定会是这样。请记住，在疫情通胀发生之前，普通民众多年来都没有看到显著的通货膨胀。这根本不是任何人的心态的一部分。你知道，例如，当你看到工会在工资谈判或其他相关背景下，通货膨胀本应是相关的，但令人惊讶的是，它根本不在任何人的脑海中，甚至在通货膨胀开始后，人们也花了一段时间才开始思考这个问题，因为它多年来已经变得如此无关紧要，以至于它根本不是美国人思维框架的一部分。我在教学生时深有体会，因为对于美国学生来说，我通常需要做大量工作才能解释例如名义利率和实际利率之间的区别。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would think almost definitely yes. Remember that going into the co inflation, you know, regular people hadn't seen significant amounts of inflation for years. It just wasn't really part of the mindset of anyone. you know when you saw for example unions in wage negotiations or other context things where inflation should have been relevant it was sort of striking that it just wasn't on anyone's mind and it even took a while after the inflation started for people to even think about this because it had become so much of a non-issue for so many years that it was just not part of the mental frame of Americans I see this very much when I teach students because for American students typically I have to do a lot of work to just explain the difference for example between a nominal interest rate and a real interest rate.</p>

Emmy Nakamura: 没错。但相比之下，拉丁美洲的学生立刻就能理解，因为那是他们成长经历的一部分，对吧？我认为这种区别可能至少模糊了一点，因为现在人们已经经历了几年，在这几年里，关注通货膨胀变得很重要。所以我的猜测是，如果我们再次看到通货膨胀，那么人们会更快地开始质疑这是否会持续更长时间，以及既然我们最近经历了两次通胀事件，这是否会成为新常态。你知道，我认为重要的是不要忘记美联储和许多其他国家在争取低通胀预期方面付出了多么大的努力。你知道，这肯定会消散。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Exactly. But in contrast for Latin American students they get it immediately because it's just part of how they grew up right and I think that that distinction has probably blurred at least a little bit right because now people have gone through a few years where it mattered to pay a little bit of attention to inflation. And so my guess is that if we start to see inflation again, it's going to be, you know, a much more rapid transition to where people will start to ask whether this is going to last longer, whether now that we've seen, you know, two inflationary episodes in the recent past, whether this is sort of the new normal. You know, I think it's important not to forget how hard one those expectations of low inflation were for the Federal Reserve and many other countries. you know, it's certainly something that can dissipate.</p>

### 识别冲击：关税与产出缺口

Tracy Aloway: 那么，因为我们正在讨论泰勒规则，它基本上建议或描述了中央银行应如何根据通货膨胀和产出缺口的变化来调整利率。我们基本上是在谈论冲击对产出缺口的影响。这里有一个细微之处，因为冲击可能是不同的，并且对产出缺口产生不同的影响。关税会是哪种类型的冲击？我知道这不是您论文的主题，但凭您的直觉，您会如何描述关税在经济冲击及其对产出影响方面的作用？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, because we're dealing with the Taylor rule, which basically, you know, suggests or describes either way what the central bank should do with interest rates in response to inflation and changes in the output gap. We're talking basically about like the impact of shocks to that output gap. There's a nuance here because like shocks can be different and have different effects on the output gap. What type of shock would tariffs be? I know this isn't the subject of your paper, but you know your gut instinct. How would you describe tariffs in terms of that economic shock and the impact on output?</p>
</details>

Emmy Nakamura: 最近有许多关于这个主题的学术论文。这并非我们论文的重点，但我认为这些论文的总体信息是，你确实需要审视关税的初始影响，但你不想忽视第二轮效应。因此，如果你开始看到长期通胀预期失控等影响，那正是中央银行会积极应对的通胀部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, there have been a number of recent academic papers on this. It's not the focus of our paper, but I think that the overall message of those papers is that you do want to look through sort of the initial impact of the tariffs, but you don't want to look through sort of second round effects. So to the extent that you start to see an effect in terms of longer run inflation expectations becoming unhinged and so on, that's the part of the inflation that the central bank would want to be responding aggressively to.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal: 我还有另一个问题，可能超出了这篇特定论文的范围，但它与今天的情况密切相关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have another question that may be outside the scope of this specific paper but no it has a lot of relevance to today.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal: 当你思考世界各地的一些中央银行比其他银行拥有更多信誉时，这是否是因为那些优秀的中央银行有更聪明、更好的经济学家为它们提供更好的政策建议？还是与允许中央银行独立运作的政治条件有更多关系，这更多地源于这些国家的政治领域？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's a lot when you think about around the world some central banks have more credibility than some others. Is it that the good central banks just had like smarter better economists do advising them better on policy than the other ones? Or does it have more to do with the political conditions that allow a central bank to operate separately from to essentially operate with independent agency and is that more of a thing that originates in the political sphere of those countries?</p>
</details>

Emmy Nakamura: 我认为政治显然非常重要。我想我会指出两件事。一是20世纪70年代和80年代的那些困难时期，这发生在世界许多国家，这些国家的人民意识到他们多么痛恨通货膨胀。我们在疫情通胀期间也略微尝到了这种滋味。通货膨胀非常不受欢迎，正是因为这个原因，在美国才有可能任命保罗·沃尔克（Paul Volcker: 曾任美联储主席，以其在20世纪80年代初通过大幅提高利率成功抑制高通胀而闻名）担任美联储主席，尽管在他被任命之前，人们就知道他会做什么，他会积极提高利率，这将是痛苦的。所以，能够做出这样的任命是一件了不起的事情，但当然，其他国家也发生了类似的事情，也有类似的激进中央银行家被任命来控制通货膨胀。所以我认为这部分确实源于公众对通货膨胀的反应，但与此同时，它并没有在所有地方发生，就像你说的，它只能在中央银行受到政治保护、中央银行独立性的背景下发生。也许在某些方面，它能够发生本身就是一件了不起的事情，我们看到了许多国家经历了如此长时间的低通胀时期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think clearly the politics is very important. I guess it would point to two things. One is those difficult decades of the 1970s and 1980s which occurred in many countries around the world and where people in these countries realized how much they hated inflation. We got a little bit of a taste of this during the COVID inflation. Inflation just is incredibly unpopular and it was for this reason that it was possible in the United States to appoint Paul Vulkar as chairman of the Fed even though it was known before he was appointed what he was going to do that he was going to raise interest rates aggressively that this was going to be painful. and so that's a remarkable thing that it was actually possible to make this appointment but of course similar things actually happened in other countries as well there were similar appointments of aggressive you know central bankers that controlled inflation so I think part of this did come out of you know sort of a public reaction to inflation but at the same time it didn't happen everywhere just like you said and could only happen in the context of political protection for the central bank central bank independence And perhaps in some ways it's just sort of a remarkable thing that it ever did happen that we've seen this long period of of low inflation in many of these countries.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal: 我突然意识到，多年来我一直听到各种关于偏离泰勒规则的说法，无论是零利率下限时期我们无法降低利率，还是最近他们与70年代通胀疯狂时期的偏差有多大。有没有一个好的衡量标准，比如“不，他们显然应该更高”，泰勒规则对此有何看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I suddenly realized I've heard all over over the years at various times where we're where deviations from the Taylor rule whether it was the zero lower bound era where we couldn't lower them or more recently how far were they off in the 70s when inflation was going crazy is there is there a good measure of like no clearly they should have been higher this like what does the Taylor rule say about that</p>
</details>

Emmy Nakamura: 20世纪70年代非常有趣，因为我们在论文中指出的一点是，泰勒规则的预测和规定当然只取决于你输入的数据。一些学术文献指出，你不一定想使用我们今天拥有的关于产出缺口等数据，因为随着时间的推移，对产出缺口的看法，也就是经济过热的程度，已经发生了变化。特别是在20世纪70年代，美联储对美国经济的潜在产出持相当乐观的态度，因此它对产出缺口的判断是相当负面的，这有助于从泰勒规则的角度解释为什么他们在20世纪70年代采取了相当鸽派的货币政策。所以实际上，如果你使用美联储当时认为的产出缺口以及通货膨胀的实时数据，那么你或多或少会得到他们当时所做的事情。至于为什么许多人认为20世纪70年代的政策过于不足，这与你是否认为那些产出缺口衡量标准是合理的有很大关系。你知道，根据美联储目前的估计，它们远不如当时那么鸽派。但这突出了一点，即使你想要创建一个非常技术化、不给你任何回旋余地的规则，那也并非完全正确，因为产出缺口之类的东西不是你可以像通货膨胀那样直接从统计数据中读出来的。实际上，你可以，所以结果是，你对经济潜力相对于当前位置的判断确实很重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The 1970 is very interesting because one of the things we point out in our paper is that the the predictions and the prescriptions of the tailor rule are of course only as good as the inputs you put into them. And one of the things that some of the academic literature's pointed out is that you don't necessarily want to use the data that we have today on something like the output gap because views about the output gap that is you know how overheating is the economy have changed over time and in particular in the 1970s the Federal Reserve was pretty optimistic about the potential output of the US economy and for that reason its judgment about the output gap was pretty negative and this helps to explain through the lens of the Taylor rule, why they had pretty doubbish monetary policy in the 1970s. So actually, if you take the real-time data on what the Fed said it thought the output gap was at the time along with inflation, then you get more or less what they did. And what happened in terms of, you know, why many people think that the policy was too deficient in the 1970s has a lot to do whether you think those measures of the output gap were reasonable. And you know the current estimates according to the Fed you know are much less sort of doubbish than they than they were at the time. But it highlights the fact that even when you want to create a rule which is sort of very technocratic and doesn't give you any wiggle room that's not entirely true because something like the output gap is not something that you can just read off a statistic like inflation. actually you can and so as a consequence you know it really matters what judgment you take about where you are relative to the economy's potential</p>

### 技术规则、信誉与货币政策的未来

Joe Weisenthal: 好的，回到这个技术性规则的理念，无论是规范性的还是描述性的，我知道人们对此有不同的看法，但据说它可能具有规范性的好处之一是，你有一个中央银行，它会做一些非常可预测的事情，你知道它的反应函数是什么，你知道它会如何应对通货膨胀。这如何影响信誉方面？因为另一方面，你知道，更具信誉的中央银行可以做自己的事情，超越泰勒规则，就像你在论文中说的那样。但另一方面，这种意想不到的行为是否会影响它们自己的信誉，即使它在短期内是成功的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">okay just going back to the idea of this technocratic rule whether it's prescriptive or descriptive I know people have different opinions on that but supposedly one of the benefits of it being possibly prescriptive was that you have a central bank that like does a very expected thing like you know what the reaction function is and you know what they're going to do in response to inflation. How does that play into the credibility aspect? Because on the other hand, you know, more credible central banks, they can kind of go off and do their own thing, go beyond the Taylor rule as you put it in the paper. But on the other hand, does that unexpected behavior perhaps have an impact on their own credibility even if it's successful in the short term?</p>
</details>

Emmy Nakamura: 绝对是。我的意思是，我认为像泰勒规则这样的技术性规则在货币政策的规范中绝对占有一席之地。而且，也许有人甚至会争辩说，在应对许多类型的通胀事件时，它们应该成为默认选项，因为有许多类型的通胀事件，比如那些与过度需求相关的，你知道，经济过热，甚至更糟糕的是，仅仅是自我实现的通胀担忧，这些担忧会螺旋式上升，导致非常严重的通胀事件。所以，在应对所有这些类型的事件时，你知道，让人们能够预期中央银行会按照泰勒规则之类的东西积极应对，这可能是一个非常好的主意。而且在某种意义上，你可能希望将超越泰勒规则视为一种你不会一直做的事情，但你认识到在某些时候，当你强烈感觉到一种不同类型的冲击正在冲击经济时，它必须发生。在其中一些事件中，你可能实际上会非常明确地使用前瞻性指引。例如，在大衰退期间，那是一个最明确使用前瞻性指引的时期，用来谈论美联储将把利率维持在零多久。那是一个非常强大的工具，可以影响长期利率。这在数据中很容易看到。这就是那种，你知道，它不是关于偏离声誉，确实，核心思想是，你希望市场绝对相信中央银行会积极应对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely. I mean, I I think that the ta like that technocratic rules like the Taylor rule, they absolutely have a place in the cannon of monetary policy. And you know perhaps one could even argue that they should be the default in response to many kinds of inflationary episodes because there are many kinds of inflationary episodes like those associated with excessive demand you know an overheating economy and also you even worse just sort of self-fulfilling worries about inflation that spiral off into really serious inflationary episodes. So, in response to all of those kinds of episodes, you know, it it may may be a very good idea for the for people to be able to expect that the central bank is going to respond aggressively along the lines of something like the Taylor rule. And there's a sense in which you might want to think about going beyond the Taylor rule as something that you don't do all the time, but that you recognize has to happen some of the time when you have a strong sense that a different kind of shock is hitting the economy. And in some of those episodes, you you might actually want to very explicitly use forward guidance. So, for example, during the Great Recession, that was a period when there was, you know, some of the most explicit usage of forward guidance to talk about the timing of how long the Fed was going to keep interest rates at zero. And that was a very powerful tool in terms of affecting longerterm interest rates. It's very easy to see that in the data. And that's the kind of thing where you know it's not about going away from reputation which it's it's true that core idea is that you want markets to absolutely be confident that the central bank is going to respond aggressively</p>

</details>

Joe Weisenthal: 我只有一个最后一个问题，有点自私。您谈到了通货膨胀的不同来源，无论是过度需求还是供给。特蕾西和我在2021年、2022年做了很多关于供应链的播客节目。我们谈到了港口和所有这些事情，但有人可能会说我们只见树木不见森林。港口的压力不是因为供应链，而是因为需求过大。X工厂的压力不是因为某个供应链或缺少零件，而是因为需求过大。你们只是通过关注在需求旺盛时必然会出现的瓶颈来掩盖需求问题。我还在思考这个问题。我心想：“哦，我们是不是应该关注一些？”你知道，我心想，但您已经描述了许多这种通货膨胀，而“完美去通胀”的部分原因是因为其中很多是供给侧的。你知道，我正在为我们对供给侧的关注寻找一个辩护。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I just have one last question and it's kind of selfish. So you're talking about, you know, different sources of inflation, whether it's excess demand or whether it's supply. You know, Tracy and I did like a ton of podcast episodes in 2021, 2022 about supply chains. We talked about the ports and all this stuff that you know, but someone could say you guys were missing the forest for the trees. The stress at the ports wasn't about supply chains. It was because there was too much demand. The stress at the X factory wasn't because of some supply chain or missing part. There was just too much demand. You guys were just disguising demand problems by focusing on choke points that are inevitably going to emerge when booming demand. I still think about this. I'm like, "Oh, should we have focus some?" You know, I'm like, but you have described a lot of this inflation and part of the reason for the immaculate disinflation is because a lot of it was supply defense. You know, I'm looking for a defense of all this focus that we did on the supply side.</p>
</details>

Emmy Nakamura: 所以，我认为您说得对，在谈论需求冲击和供应链限制（比如港口、苏伊士运河等）之间存在一种错误的二分法，因为您说得对，如果需求过大，那么在某个时候，这些供应链就会堵塞。所以，这些供应链限制与供给冲击并不完全相同，这是绝对正确的，但还有其他一些东西是直接的冲击。

And so it's it's it's absolutely right that those kinds of supply constraints are not quite the same as supply shocks, right? But there are other things which are just directly shocks.</p>

Emmy Nakamura: 这是一个非常重要的问题，你知道，我认为我关于20世纪70年代的讨论，以及关于产出缺口的观点随时间变化的事实，以及在疫情通胀期间，观点也发生了变化，都表明这绝非完美，但与此同时，我认为有时会强烈感觉到，你知道，例如疫情通胀不仅仅是关于自我实现的通胀预期或类似的东西，所以这就是我想要强调这个想法的地方，即说我们总能自信地识别冲击（这显然我们不能）与说我们永远不能识别任何冲击之间存在差异，你知道，以至于我们需要一直将自己束缚在一个机械规则上，而这个规则可能偏离理论上真正最优的货币政策。但再次强调，你知道，我认为关键的想法是，所有这一切都必须在中央银行对长期通胀稳定性的承诺充满信心的背景下进行。

<p class="english-text">That is a very important question and you know I think my discussion of the 1970s and the fact that you know views have changed over time about the output gap during that period and also during the the co inflation you know views have changed shows that this is by no means perfect but at the same time I think there are times when there's a strong sense that you know the co inflation for example wasn't just about you know self-fulfilling inflation expectations or something like this and so that's where I want to emphasize this idea that there's a difference between saying that we can always identify the shocks with confidence which clearly we cannot and saying that we can never identify any shocks you know to the extent that we need to tie ourselves all the time to a mechanical rule which you know may deviate from from what theory really says is optimal monetary policy but again you know I think crucial ideas is all of this has to take place against a background where there's sort of confidence in the central bank's commitment to longer run inflation stability.</p>

### 播客总结与关键启示

Tracy Aloway: 乔，那太棒了。我真的很喜欢那次对话。艾米有一种非凡的方式，能非常简单、易懂地解释一些复杂的概念，因为如果你翻阅她的论文，会发现有很多公式之类的东西。所以看起来很复杂，但她解释得非常清楚。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Joe, that was fantastic. I really enjoyed that conversation. And Emmy has a remarkable way of explaining like some complicated concepts very si simply and in a real understandable way cuz if you flip through her paper there's a lot of formulas and things like that. So it looks complicated but she explained it very clearly</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal: 极其清楚。我也有同样的想法，我当时想，哦，天哪，如果能像个学生一样学习，那该多好。成为学生听起来很有趣。但她解释得非常清楚，你知道，她是学术界最重要的通胀专家之一，所以能听到她对过去五年以及从中吸取的教训的总结，真是一次难得的享受。

<p class="english-text">incredibly clearly. I had the same thought I was like oh man it would be so nice to just be like a student and like learn you know get to being a student sounds very fun. Um but um but incredibly clear and you know we're she's uh you know one of the foremost inflation experts in sort of academia and so to hear her sort of like sort of summation of how she thinks about the last 5 years and the lessons learned from it was like a real treat.</p>
</details>

Tracy Aloway: 是的。显然，有几个要点。第一，政策制定者在冲击发生时识别冲击极其困难，但有时他们可以做到，就像在疫情中一样。我想第二个要点是信誉的重要性，对吧？如果你设法成功控制通货膨胀多年、几十年，或者无论多久，你就会建立起社会资本，这使得你在面临另一次危机时能够更加灵活。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And obviously there are a couple takeaways there. So one, it is incredibly hard for policy or often incredibly hard for policy makers to identify shocks, you know, at the moment that they're happening, but sometimes they can like in co and I guess the second takeaway is the importance of credibility, right? And if you if you manage to successfully control inflation for years and years and decades or whatever, you build up that social capital which then allows you to be somewhat more flexible when you have another crisis.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal: 是的，我觉得那真的很有趣。另外，还有几件事让我印象深刻。首先，直到读这篇论文之前，这只是我的错，因为我随时都可以查到，我没有意识到泰勒规则是基于六年的数据建立起来的。它就像是“好的，这是一个描述中央银行何时做得好的规则”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I I thought that was really interesting. Um, also there are a couple other things that struck me. First of all, until reading this paper, and this is just my fault because I could look this up at any time. I had not realized that the Taylor rule was built up six years of data. There's like okay this is the rule that describes when a central bank is doing a good job</p>
</details>

Tracy Aloway: 基本上是货币政策。

<details>

<p class="english-text">monetary policy basically</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal: 这个规则描述了一个运作良好的中央银行是什么样子，基本上是六年的数据，这很有趣，对我来说也很有趣。其次，即使它看起来像一个你无法逃脱的硬性规则，你仍然必须判断产出缺口，而且在2008年和2009年之后，关于产出缺口的大小存在非常大的争议，关于产能或充分就业是什么样子存在非常尖锐的分歧。所以即使那样也无法完全解决问题。即使你将自己束缚在一个硬性规则的鞭笞之下，或者将自己绑在硬性规则的桅杆上，问题仍然很棘手。

<details>

<p class="english-text">this is the rule that sort of describes what a well functioning central bank looks like is basically six years you know that's interesting that's interesting to me too and second of all this idea that even though it does look like a hard rule that you can't escape the fact that you have to judge the output gap and there were very big debates about the size of the output gap after 2008 and 2009 very sharp disagreements about the capacity or what full employment looked like. So even that doesn't fully solve you. Even if you do tie yourself to the lash of a hard rule or lash yourself to the mast of a hard rule, the tough problem still.</p>
</details>

Tracy Aloway: 是的，这很棘手。好了，我们就到这里吧？
