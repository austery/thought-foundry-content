### 视觉感知与大脑的创造力

我们花费巨大的精力试图捕捉瞬间，将记忆定格，通过绘画、雕塑、摄影和家庭录影等方式，试图在事物消逝后留存它们。但你是否知道，我们的大脑和眼睛早已被“硬连线”以实现这一点？我并非指记忆本身，而是指当一个物体消失后，你的眼睛仍能感知它存在一瞬间的事实。这个现象，我已思考了超过35年。这便是**视觉暂留**（Persistence of Vision）的原理，它也是电影、动画乃至电视成为可能的基础。你的眼睛虽然是精妙的器官，却有一个小小的“怪癖”：在物体消失后，它仍会持续感知约十分之一秒。这背后，我们的大脑扮演着至关重要的角色。它不仅仅是视网膜上的一个小小的“怪癖”让我们得以观看影像，我们的大脑天生就富有想象力，能够接收现实（在此案例中是一系列静态图像），并从中创造出全新且富有创意的成果。

We spend great effort
into trying to capture moments.
Freeze-frame memories,
drawings, paintings, sculptures,
photography and home movies
are all our attempts
to remember something after it's gone.
But did you know that your brain and eyes
are already hardwired to do this?
I'm not talking about memory.
I'm talking about the fact
that your eye continues to see an object
for a split second
after that object disappears.
I've been thinking about that fact
for over 35 years.
This principle is what makes movies,
cartoons and even TV possible.
Your eye is an amazing organ,
but it has one little quirk.
It continues to see an object
for a 10th of a second
after the object disappears.
Of course, our brains
play a huge role in this.
It's not just the quirk in the retina
that allow us to see film and animation.
Our brains are hardwired
to be imaginative,
to take in reality,
in this case a series of still images,
and create something new and innovative
out of what it was given.

### 从艺术到科技的融合：3D打印的启蒙

我童年时，对定格动画（stop-motion animation）情有独钟，着迷于《金刚》、《红鼻子驯鹿鲁道夫》、《星球大战》中的场景，以及《圣诞夜惊魂》和《超级无敌掌门狗》等作品。我花费大量时间思考这些电影制作人究竟使用何种工具来创造银幕魔术。当时的艺术家、技术人员、摄影师和动画师们，尽管工具相比今日显得原始，却创造出了具有里程碑意义的视觉效果，令观众惊叹不已。我本人也因此走上了学习艺术的道路。1999年大学毕业时，我对电子邮件的编写都知之甚少，对计算机感到不适并加以抗拒。像许多艺术家一样，我的职业生涯并非一帆风顺，而是辗转于不同的工作岗位。最终，我在一所设计学校负责模型工作室，在那里，我的人生轨迹发生了改变。我接触到了**3D打印机**（3D printer），这项令人惊叹的工具，如同科幻小说中的存在，它成功地连接了数字世界与物理世界。对我而言，这使得数字世界不再那么令人生畏，变得更加平易近人。我会在夜间阅读说明手册，白天则教授学生如何使用它。我由此领悟到，创造力不仅在于“制造”事物，更在于“重塑”我们制造事物的方式。如今，3D打印机已不再像20年前那样罕见，但其潜在影响依然巨大。

人类天生热爱用双手劳作。数千年来，我们制作的一切都是手工打造且独一无二的。近些年来，我们逐渐转向大规模生产。如今，当我们批量生产这些物体时，每个物体在设计上都需要保持一致。创新催生了流水线和工具，能够日产数千个精确但完全相同的“小玩意儿”。而3D打印机则不同，它将一个三维物体切片成数百甚至数千个二维图像，类似于CT扫描。然后，这些图像逐层构建。例如，一种PolyJet打印机喷射出液态树脂，并用紫外光固化。这很像你家里的喷墨打印机。想象一下，在一张纸上打印字母“A”，并在完全相同的位置喷射出“A”。在打印头每次经过之间，想象纸张稍微下沉一点。最终，你会得到一个挤出的“A”。就像你家里的喷墨打印机一样，打印一段莎士比亚的十四行诗或一个简单的句子，所需的时间并不会更长。打印内容的细节或复杂性，并不必然增加制作时间。我们习惯于一个等式：细节越多，复杂度越高，制作时间越长。但借助3D打印机，你可以利用大规模生产的速度，同时让每个物体都独一无二，拥有自己定制的设计和个性。

<summary>Original English</summary>
I just loved stop-motion animation.
King Kong, Rudolph the Red-Nose reindeer,
scenes from "Star Wars,"
"Nightmare Before Christmas"
and Wallace and Gromit.
I spent my childhood wondering
what types of tools these filmmakers use
to create movie magic.
Artists, technicians,
cinematographers and animators
were creating groundbreaking visuals
using primitive tools
compared to today's standards.
Audiences leaving the theaters
wondering how the heck
those geniuses pulled it off.
That was me.
So I went to school to study art.
When I graduated college in 1999,
I barely knew how to write an email.
Computers were not something
I was comfortable with, so I resisted.
Like many artists,
I bounced from job to job.
My career path was not a straight line.
Eventually, I ended up at a design school
running their model shop.
It was here the trajectory
of my life changed.
I was introduced to a 3D printer.
This amazing tool
was like science fiction.
It bridged the digital world
and the physical worlds together.
And for me, it made the digital
world far less intimidating
and more approachable.
So I'd read the instruction
manual at night
and teach the students
how to use it during the day.
I realized then that creativity
isn't just about making things,
it's also about reinventing
how we make them.
So a 3D printer isn't as unusual
as it was 20 years ago.
But the potential impacts are enormous.
Humans love to work with our hands.
For thousands of years, everything
we made was handcrafted and unique.
More recently, we've drifted
towards making lots and lots of things.
Now, as we mass produce these objects,
each object needed
to be the same by design.
Innovation has built
assembly lines and tools
that can pump out
thousands of widgets a day,
precise but all the same.
With a 3D printer,
it takes a three-dimensional object
and slices it into hundreds,
if not thousands,
of two-dimensional images.
Kind of like a CAT scan.
And then those images
are built up layer by layer.
A polyjet printer sprays down liquid resin
and a bright UV light goes
and cures that resin.
It’s a lot like your inkjet
printer at your house.
Imagine printing the letter A
on a piece of paper
and jetting down the A
in the exact same spot.
And between each pass of the printer head,
imagine dropping the paper slightly.
Eventually you're going
to end up with an extruded A.
Now, just like your inkjet
printer at your house,
it doesn't take any longer
to print a paragraph of Shakespeare
or a rudimentary sentence.
The detail of what you're printing
doesn't necessarily add more time.
We’re so used to the equation:
the more detail,
the more complexity to something,
the longer it takes to make.
But with a 3D printer,
you can utilize the speed
of a mass-produced object,
but each object can be unique,
have their own bespoke
design and personality.

### 定格动画的革新：LAIKA的3D打印实践

2006年，在俄勒冈州波特兰市郊一家初创动画工作室 **LAIKA**，我们与一个小团队一起，开创了在定格动画中使用3D打印技术来制作**替换动画**（replacement animation）的先河。我们的创新想法是将这项已有百年历史的替换动画技术，与21世纪的3D打印技术相结合。我们将计算机动画的强大与精妙之处加以利用，但与皮克斯或梦工厂渲染模型不同的是，我们将面部几何数据发送至3D打印机，然后打印成实体，再将其安装到定格动画的木偶上。电影《卡罗琳》（Coraline）是首部使用3D打印脸部的影片。在接下来的18年里，通过六部电影，LAIKA不断拓展定格动画的可能性，同时也重新定义了3D打印行业的能力边界。

起初，我们仅使用单一材料打印脸部，需要手动上色。但对于接下来的几部电影，我们开始采用彩色打印。彩色打印与我们之前使用的树脂打印有所不同。在这种技术中，彩色胶水喷洒在白色粉末上。这种打印机的科学原理在于液体与干燥粉末之间的吸收率。两者结合，创造出几何形状和混合色彩。然而，我们住在俄勒冈州波特兰，那里经常下雨。这意味着如果在夏天打印一张脸，冬天打印完全相同的脸，由于湿度差异，它们的大小和颜色都会有所不同。但当时市面上只有这一款彩色打印机，所以多年来我们只能将就使用。

在此期间，我们还在计算机中设计和工程化整个头部。计算机建模师们身兼数职：他们既是雕塑家，塑造面部外形；又是工程师，设计所有内部组件。我们称这些为非常高级的“土豆先生”（Mr. Potato Heads）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
And they were about
to have a fundamental impact
on the way that stop-motion
movies are made.
Starting in 2006,
working with a small team
at a fledgling animation studio
outside of Portland, Oregon,
called LAIKA,
we pioneered the use of using 3D printers
for stop-motion animation
to produce replacement animation.
Our novel idea
was to take this 100-year-old technique
of replacement animation,
and fuse it with 21st-century
3D printing technology.
We'd harness the power and subtlety
of the computer animation,
but instead of rendering out a model
like Pixar or Dreamworks would,
we would send face geometry
to a 3D printer
and then have it become a physical object
that would snap onto a stop-motion puppet.
"Coraline" was the first film
to have 3D-printed faces.
Over the course of the next
18 years and six films,
LAIKA’s continued to pioneer
what stop-motion is capable of,
as well as really redefining
what's capable
in the 3D printing industry.
At first, we started printing
faces out of a single material
and we had to hand-paint things.
But then for our next few films,
we started using color printing.
Now, color printing was different
than the resin printing we'd used before.
Here, colored glue is sprayed down
onto white powder.
Now, the science behind
this printer is the absorption rate
between the liquid and the dry powder.
Together, they came together to create
the geometry as well as the mixed color.
Now the problem is we live
in Portland, Oregon.
I don't know if you guys noticed,
but it tends to rain a little bit here.
So what that means if we printed
a face in the summer
and that exact same face in the winter,
they would come out
different sizes and different colors
because of the humidity differences.
But it was the only
color printer on the market.
So for years we made do.
Now we'd also design and engineer
the entire head in the computer.
Computer modelers wore many hats.
They were first the sculptor
that was sculpting
the outside of the face,
and then they would switch gears
and become the engineer
to engineer all the inner components.
We refer to these as very fancy
Mr. Potato Heads.

### 体素打印的突破与未来展望

2016年，3D打印领域发生了一件令人兴奋的事情，我们这些3D打印爱好者都为之振奋。那就是**体素打印**（Voxel printing）。大家肯定都听说过像素（pixels），构成二维图像的微小二维点。而体素（voxel）本质上就是一个三维像素。体素非常微小，每立方英寸大约有3.38亿个体素。与基于数十年二维喷墨技术、颜色可以重叠混合的喷墨打印不同，体素无法混合。每个体素必须占据其自身的三维空间。打印机逐层喷射出独立的青色、黄色、品红色、黑色、白色和透明树脂体素。

由于我们打印的是三维物体，物体的形状以及光线照射到表面后被反射或吸收的方式，都会影响我们眼睛看到的颜色。这意味着，用于打印橙色球体的品红和黄色体素的图案，与打印橙色立方体的图案是不同的。如果将我们打印的脸部置于电子显微镜下观察，你不会看到平滑混合的颜色，而是数百万个独立的体素。这很像点彩画派的绘画：如果你站得足够远，颜色看起来像是混合在一起的；但当你靠近画布时，就能看到独立的色点。

这对3D打印世界来说是革命性的。不仅能够制造出精密的彩色部件，还能开始控制其内部结构。请记住，体素遍布整个体积，而不仅仅是表面。通过利用通常用于大制作电影中渲染爆炸、龙卷风或汹涌海洋的视觉特效软件，LAIKA能够将超密点的点云数据转化为3D打印的体素，并精确控制三维空间中的体素。我们在这一领域的创新前沿。我们可以将硬质材料和软质材料在体素层面结合，从而生产出具有独特性能的新型材料。

有人可能会好奇黑布下的这个不祥物体是什么。还记得3D物体是如何逐层构建的吗？事实证明，你可以利用CT扫描数据，3D打印出患者身体部位的完美复制品。通过体素，可以创建骨骼、组织、肌肉、血管和皮肤般的材料。外科医生可以利用真实的患者数据，3D打印出患者头部的完美复制品，精确标示出肿瘤的位置，然后进行一次模拟手术来移除肿瘤。LAIKA的Rob Ducey，作为2006年原始团队的成员之一，与Nick Jacobson及其他医学领域的研究人员合作，撰写了关于这一主题的研究论文。令人惊叹的是，LAIKA动画工作室与众多享有盛誉的医学研究人员一起，成为了在医学领域率先使用体素打印技术的先驱。

但我们与其他3D打印用户一样。是的，我们因在定格动画中率先使用3D打印技术而获得了科学技术奥斯卡奖，但大多数其他用户仍在制造原型。而我们，则将3D打印机作为一种创意表达的工具，以某种方式赋予静态物体生命。我们打印的每一张脸都是独一无二的，每一张都是经过艺术家手工完成的艺术品。在我们最新的电影《遗失的环节》（Missing Link）中，我们打印了超过106,000张独特的脸。我们有一个由“脸部图书管理员”管理的脸部库，负责编目和存档每一个独立的表情。我们还因在定格动画电影中拥有最多3D打印脸部数量而获得了吉尼斯世界纪录。

<summary>Original English</summary>
Now, starting in 2016,
something really exciting
happened in the 3D printing world.
I don't know if any of you guys heard,
but man, us 3D printing nerds were stoked.
Are you ready for this?
Voxel printing.
You've all heard of pixels, right?
The little 2D dots
that make up 2D imagery.
Well, a voxel is basically
a three-dimensional pixel.
A voxel is tiny.
There's something like
338 million voxels in a cubic inch.
So unlike the inkjet printing
we'd used before
that were based on decades
of 2D inkjet technology,
where colors can overlap to mix color,
voxels cannot mix.
Each voxel has to occupy its own 3D space.
The printer jets down distinct voxels
of cyan, yellow, magenta,
black, white, and clear resin
layer by layer in different patterns.
Now, because we're printing
a three-dimensional object,
the shape of that object,
and the way that light hits the surface
and is either reflected off
or absorbed in,
affects the colors our eyes see.
So what that means is the pattern
of voxels of magenta and yellow
to print an orange sphere
are different than that of an orange cube.
If you were to take one of our faces
and look at it under
an electron microscope,
you would not see smooth mixed color,
but instead millions and millions
of distinct voxels.
It's a lot like a pointillist painting.
If you stand back far enough,
it appears as though the colors are mixed.
But when you get close to the canvas,
you can see the individual colors.
This was groundbreaking
in the 3D-printing world.
Not only could you create
sophisticated color parts,
but you could start to control
the interior as well.
Remember, there are voxels
throughout the entire volume,
not just on the surface.
By leveraging visual effects
software packages typically used
in big-budget movies to render
explosions, tornadoes,
or raging oceans,
LAIKA has been taking
super-dense point cloud data
and transferring them
into 3D printed voxels
and being able to precisely control
voxels in a 3D space.
We're at the tip of the innovation
sphere in this area.
We can take hard materials
and soft materials
and combine them on a voxel level,
producing a brand new material
with unique properties in the process.
Anyone wondering what this is over here,
this ominous object under the black cloth?
Well, remember how a 3D object
is built up out of layers?
Well, it turns out you
can take the CAT scan data,
and you can 3D print a perfect replica
of a patient's body part.
By taking voxels, you can create materials
that are like bone, tissue,
muscle veins, and skin.
A surgeon can take real patient data
and 3D print a perfect replica
of a patient's head
with the exact placement of their tumor,
and then do a practice operation
removing that tumor.
LAIKA’s very own Rob Ducey,
who was part of that
original team in 2006,
has helped write a research paper,
along with Nick Jacobson
and other researchers
in the medical field on this very subject.
It's amazing to see
LAIKA Animation Studios,
alongside other prestigious
medical researchers,
as the one pioneering the use
of voxel printing in the medical field.
But we're like any other user
in the 3D-printing world.
Yes, we've won a scientific
and technical Oscar
for pioneering the use of 3D printing
in stop-motion animation,
but most other users
are creating prototypes.
We’re using a 3D printer
as a creative expression.
In a way, bringing still objects to life.
Each face we print is unique.
Each one is a work of art
that's hand-finished by artists.
For our latest film, "Missing Link,"
we printed over 106,000 unique faces.
We have a face library
run by face librarians
who catalog and archive
each individual expression.
We've also won a Guinness
Book of World Records
for the most number of 3D-printed faces
in a stop-motion animated film.

### 现场演示与艺术驱动的创新

大家知道，定格动画是一个极其缓慢的过程。一名动画师，每周工作40小时，大约只能制作出三到四秒的画面。如果让我当场演示动画制作，我可能需要几周时间才能完成一点东西，而且如果你们能坚持那么久，大概也会感到失望，因为我不是动画师，效果不会太好。

起初，我们曾考虑制作一个**佐罗特罗普**（zoetrope）。它在电影摄影机发明之前就被创造出来，是一种让静态图像动起来的方式。我们曾想把它搬上舞台，然后我疯狂地转动它，但这个设计的缺点是所有精美的艺术作品都被隐藏在巨大的圆柱壁后面。所以，我们为这个TEDx舞台设计、工程化并制造了一个特别的东西。

这就是“诺曼”（Norman）。他是我们典型的定格动画木偶之一，大约十英寸高，有一个金属骨架。动画师会移动木偶，同时也会更换它的脸部。这就是我们用3D打印的脸部之一，背面有磁铁，可以吸附在木偶上。所以，当动画师去片场时，他们会带着他们的小角色、小木偶，以及一盒脸部。我们每秒钟的画面需要提供24张脸。这展示了诺曼三秒钟的动画。

想象一下这个装置：这台摄像机是你的眼睛，这个飞轮机制是你的眼睑。当我缓慢移动时，就像你在缓慢眨眼。当我向后移动时——我可以前后移动。你可能还能听到一些声音，对吧？那是断断续续的词语声。当我移动得更快时，就像你在更快地眨眼，对吧？现在，让我设置好。一旦我达到每秒24帧的“魔法速度”，你的大脑和想象力就会填补空白，你就会看到一个生动而富有创意的世界在你眼前展开。好了，这个装置有16英尺长，我必须在两秒钟内到达那里。我为此还特意锻炼了身体。他们建造这个东西时可没告诉我这一点。你们准备好了吗？

（观众回应）诺曼：嗨，很高兴见到你们。（掌声和欢呼声）好了，再来一次。那很酷。快点还是慢点？（观众：快点！）哦，我早就料到你们会这么说。好了，能把灯光调暗一些吗？开始了。

（诺曼再次出现）

那个之前视频里的小孩，就是我，热爱定格动画。这引导我走上了一条探索之路，先是发现，然后是抗拒我曾恐惧的技术。我荣幸与之共事的人们的艺术驱动力，共同构建了一个环境，让我们能够将想象力变为现实，并不仅是发明新事物，更是利用创造力来重塑我们制造它们的方式。

So the geniuses at LAIKA have been
trying to figure out a way,
in real time,
that I could demonstrate how we use
3D printers for replacement animation.
You see, stop-motion animation
is an extremely slow process.
The average animator,
working 40 hours a week,
can produce three to four
seconds of footage.
I would be up on this stage for weeks
trying to animate something for you guys,
and if any of you stuck around that long,
you'd be disappointed
because I'm not an animator
and it wouldn't look very good.
So at first we thought
about building one of these.
This is called a zoetrope.
It was invented
before film cameras existed
as a way to see still images come to life.
We thought about dragging
one of these out here
and having me spin it like crazy,
but the problem with this design
is all the beautiful artwork is hidden
behind those large cylindrical walls.
So instead,
we designed, engineered and built
something specific for this TEDx stage.
So this is Norman.
He's one of our typical
stop-motion puppets.
Norman is about ten inches tall.
He's got a metal armature.
Animators will move the puppet,
and they will also remove his face.
This is one of those 3D-printed faces.
There are magnets on the back,
and the magnets snap
the face into position.
So when an animator goes out to set,
they go out with their little
character, the little puppet,
but they also go out with a box of faces.
We're delivering 24 faces
for every second of footage.
This represents three seconds
of Norman animation.
Think about this contraption,
this camera as your eyeball
and this flywheel mechanism
as your eyelid.
As I move slowly,
it's like you're blinking slowly.
As I move backwards --
I can move forward and backwards.
Now, you can also kind of probably
hear some sounds, right?
Those are broken up sounds of words.
As I move faster, it's like
you're blinking faster, right?
Now, let me get this set up.
Once I hit the magical speed
of 24 frames a second,
your mind's imagination
will fill in the gaps,
and you'll be left with
the beautiful and creative world
coming to life before your eyes.
Alright, so this is 16 feet long,
and I've got to get over there
in about two seconds.
I've had to get in shape for this part.
They didn't tell me that
when they built this thing.
Are you guys ready?
Norman: Hi. Nice to see you guys.
Alright, one more time.
That was pretty cool.
Faster, slower?
Audience: Faster!
BM: Oh, I was afraid
you were going to say that.
Alright, can we dim the lights?
Here we go.
Norman: Hi. Nice to see you guys.
That kid you saw before in the video
loves stop-motion animation.
That led me down a path
of first discovery,
then resisting something
I feared: technology.
The artistic drive of the individuals
that I have an honor of working alongside
have built an environment
where we get to bring
imagination into reality
and forge the path forward
of not only inventing new things,
but using creativity to reinvent
how we make them.
