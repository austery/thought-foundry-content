### 《通讯员》的成功之路

**Gilbert Cruz**: 我是《**纽约时报书评**》的编辑**Gilbert Cruz**，这里是书评播客。新的一年开始了，但和每年一月常有的情况一样，我还在回味去年的书。我在假期里随处可见的一本书是**弗吉尼亚·埃文斯**的《**通讯员**》。这是一部书信体小说，通过信件讲述故事。《**通讯员**》讲述了**西比尔·范·安特沃普**的故事，她是一位年迈的前律师和法律文员。这本书于去年四月底出版，是2025年慢热型成功案例之一，口碑经过数月积累。它在秋季登上了《**纽约时报**》畅销书榜，并最终在十二月底达到榜首。很高兴能在2026年初与《**通讯员**》的作者弗吉尼亚交谈。欢迎来到书评播客。

**Gilbert Cruz**: I'm **Gilbert Cruz**, editor of the **New York Times Book Review**, and this is the book review podcast. It's a new year, but as is often the case every January, I'm still thinking about books from last year. And one of the books that I saw everywhere over my holiday break was **The Correspondent** by **Virginia Evans**. An episttolary novel that is a book that tells the story through letters, **The Correspondent**, which tells the tale of **Cibil Van Antworp**, a former attorney and legal clerk in her later years, came out at the end of last April, and it was one of 2025's slowburn success stories with word of mouth building over many, many months. It appeared on the **New York Times** bestseller list in the fall and finally hit that number one spot at the end of December. It's a delight to start 2026 by talking to the author of **The Correspondent**, Virginia. Welcome to the book review podcast.

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 非常感谢。今天能和您一起上节目我很高兴。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: Thank you so much. I'm so happy to be on with you today.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 您这一年过得真精彩！

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: What a year you had.

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 确实是精彩的一年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: What a year indeed.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 您过得怎么样？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: How are you doing indeed?

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 我过得很好，很好。我喜欢新年，喜欢重新开始，把一切抛在脑后，重新出发。但我确实感觉有点冲进了2026年。我周五还上了《早安美国》。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: I'm doing great. I'm doing great. I love new years. I love a new year. I love to start over. Kind of put everything behind me, start again. But I did feel like sort of barreled into 2026 a little bit. I was on Good Morning America on Friday.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 您等不及了。您不能把2025年抛在脑后啊，您在说什么呢？它基本上还在继续。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: You cannot wait. You can't put 2025 behind you. What are you talking about? It's essentially still going.

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 我知道。它似乎还能持续一段时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: I know. It's I think I don't know. It could go on for a while, it seems.

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 但我过得很好，很好。您呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: But I'm doing great. I'm doing great. How are you?

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 我很好，因为我在和您交谈。您有没有为您的那本“小书奇迹”举杯庆祝新年？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: I'm doing great because I'm talking to you. Did you have a New Year's toast to your your the little book that could

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 是的，我们庆祝了。我们没能熬到午夜，但在七点半左右举杯庆祝了。我们和几个朋友在七点半左右举杯，因为那天，也就是31号，我们看到它首次登上了《**纽约时报**》榜首。所以，我们和年幼的孩子以及一些朋友一起大肆庆祝了一番。然后我们十点就上床睡觉了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: Yes, we did. I We didn't make it to midnight, but we did toast around 7:30. We toasted around 7:30 with a few friends because that day, the 31st, we saw that it was number one on the **New York Times** list. For the first time, it was at number one. So, we had a big we had a big time celebrating with our young children and some friends. And then we went to bed at 10:00.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 我这么说不仅仅因为我是《**纽约时报书评**》的编辑。显然，登上《**纽约时报**》畅销书榜首是一件大事，但《**通讯员**》已经成功了好几个月了。您是什么时候第一次知道、第一次意识到，或者第一次感觉到它成功了，它有了读者群？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: I'm not saying this just cuz I am the editor of the **New York Times Book Review**. Obviously, it's a big deal to hit number one on the **New York Times** bestseller list, but **The Correspondent** has been a success for many, many, many months. When did you first know or first realize or first feel that it was working, that there was an audience for this?

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 我觉得从书出版那天起它就成功了，因为我没有任何可比较的东西，而且我对出版业一无所知。所以当书出版时，我和我丈夫为朋友们举办了一个非常棒的派对，我们觉得花了很多钱来庆祝，书就在那里，在书店里。我当时就觉得，这就是成功了。我们做到了，对我来说那感觉就是巨大的成功。然后每隔几周我就会和我的编辑联系，我会问：“这本书是不是卖得很好？销量是不是很棒？”她会说：“是啊，卖得很好。”我想，她当时可能在想：“还行吧。”然后到了夏末的某个时候，销量开始每周呈指数级增长。那时我才明白，之前“还行”的销量，现在真的变得非同寻常了。夏天的时候，我记得**安·帕切特**在**PBS新闻一小时**节目中谈到了这本书，那对我来说感觉意义重大。然后，大概在秋季我进行了一次短暂的图书巡展，见到了数百人，我在书店里遇到的每个人，康涅狄格州的**罗克西**和**科迪**，以及其他书店，他们都开始说：“这本书火起来了。我们店里都供不应求了。我们一直缺货。”然后他们就一次又一次地加印。所以那时我才开始想，哦，它真的越来越火了。但我当时没有一个参照系，我不懂出版业，现在也还是不懂。所以我以为每一步都是巅峰。我想我一直在登上新的山顶。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: I felt like it was working from the day it came out because I didn't have anything to compare it to and I didn't know anything about publishing. And so when the book came out and my husband and I threw this really great party for our friends and what we felt like was a bunch of money to celebrate and there it was and it was in the bookstore. I sort of felt like that was it. We did it and it was that felt like a huge success to me. And then every couple of weeks I would check in with my editor and I would say, "Isn't this doing great? Isn't this selling great?" And she said, "Yeah, it's doing great." I mean, she was probably thinking, "It's fine." And then sometime in the late summer, I think it really started to the sales started to kind of exponentially increase week to week. And then I understood that what it had been was fine. And then what it was becoming was really something. And so there was a moment when in the summer I believe **Anne Patchet** was on **PBS NewsHour** and she talked about the book and that felt gigantic to me. And then probably as I went on a kind of a brief book tour in the fall, meeting hundreds of people and everybody I talked to on the road in bookstores, **Roxy** and **Cody** up in Connecticut and then different bookstores, they were starting to say, "This is becoming a thing. We can't keep it in the store. We can't we keep running out of stock." And then they were going back reprint after reprint. So then I started to think, oh, it's getting bigger. But I think I just didn't have a context. I don't understand. I still don't understand publishing. So I thought every step of the way was the mountaintop. I keep getting a new mountain top, I think.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 您觉得**安·帕切特**的推荐是这本书成功的“零号病人”吗？她本身就是一位畅销书作家，拥有一家非常棒的书店，而且她还是一个书籍的布道者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Do you feel that the **Ann Patchet** endorsement was a the patient zero of this? She is a best-selling author in her own right. She owns a very wonderful bookstore, but she also such a an evangelist for books.

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 是的，我同意。我认为与其说是**PBS新闻一小时**的节目，不如说是她为我的书写了推荐语，我的书封面上就有她的推荐。我真的认为那可能是关键。如果我回溯去问，到底是什么？谁知道是什么呢？口耳相传？我不知道，不同时期，不同的书到了人们手中。但很多人很早就对我说，在它开始火起来之前，他们之所以拿起我的书，是因为封面上有一句**安·帕切特**的推荐语。她知道，当她阅读你的书，一个初出茅庐的作者，没有人认识你，她这样做是一种善意，是在给你撒上一点仙尘，让你的书能够腾飞。所以那绝对是其中一部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: Yeah, I do. More than the **PBS NewsHour** thing, I think it was that she blurbed my book and on the cover is her is her blurb. And I really think that's probably what I could go back and say, what is it? Who knows what it is? Word of mouth. I don't know, different times and different books going into people's hands. But I do think so many people said to me early on before it started to catch fire that oh I picked up your book because there was a blurb from **Anne Patchet** on the cover and she knows that when she does a kindness by reading your book your debut author nobody knows anything about you that she is giving you a little bit of a sprinkling of fairy dust to lift off. So that was definitely part of it.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: **安·帕切特**在这本书的第六页就被提到了。这两件事是如何联系在一起的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: **Annne Patchet** is referenced on I don't know page six of this book. What how did those two things intersect?

</details>

### 创作历程与写作动力

**Virginia Evans**: 我当时没想过要出版这本书。我写书已经很久了，但一直不成功。我有一本书正在向编辑推销，但卖不出去。所以我写了这本书，我称之为“味蕾清洁剂”。我当时想，我要写一本我真正想写的书，然后把它收起来，再回去写一些我打算再尝试的东西。所以这本书对我来说是一个宣泄，把所有我想表达的东西都表达出来。其中很多都与悲伤和失望有关。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: I didn't think I was going to publish this book. I had been writing books for a long time that had not been successful and I had a book out for sale to editors and it was not selling. And so I wrote this book what I was calling a pallet cleanser. I was thinking I'm going to write a book that's just a book I want to write and then I'll tuck it away and then I'll get back to work on something more that I will try again. And so this book was such an exercise of getting all the things out of me that I wanted to get out, draw out. And a lot of it had to do with grief and disappointment.

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 所以我在这本书里做了很多相当大胆的事情。比如，用**琼·迪迪恩**和**拉里·麦克默特里**的口吻写作。这是一种相当激进的举动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: And so I did a lot of things in this book that were pretty reckless. Like for instance, write in the voice of **Joan Ddian** and **Larry Mc Merry**. It's a pretty aggressive move.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 是的，这些都是大胆的尝试。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Yeah, those are big swings.

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 大胆的尝试。我认为我有勇气这样做，是因为我当时觉得没有人会看到它。我根本没打算把它交给我的经纪人。我只是想写完就收起来。我是一个书信作者，多年来我一直和**安·帕切特**通过书信交流关于书籍的事情。所以这本书的很多内容都来源于我生活中虚构化的经历。所以当我在书中让角色**西比尔**写信给**安·帕切特**时，感觉很有趣，就像是我自己的生活在小说中得到了映照。但后来我的经纪人得知我写了这本书，她问：“我能看看吗？”我说：“不。”她说：“求你了，让我看看好吗？”我说：“好吧。”她说：“我觉得我们可以卖掉这本书。”我当时真的不相信我写的任何书能卖出去。所以我说：“好吧，随便吧。拿去卖吧。”她拿去卖了，然后书卖出去了。书一卖出去，我就慌了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: Big swings. And I think I had the courage to do that because I didn't think anyone would ever see it. I didn't have any intention of giving it to my agent. I was just going to write it and then tuck it away. And so I am a letter writer and I have written letters with **Anne Patchet** over the years about books. And so so much of this book came from things that are just drawn out, fictionalized things drawn out of my own life. And so when I had the character in the book, **Syibble**, write to **Anne Patchet**, it just felt fun, like an exercise of my own life mirrored in the fiction. But and so actually then when my agent got wind that I wrote this book and she said, "Can I look at it?" And I said, "No." She said, "Could I please look at it?" I said, "Okay." She said, "I think we can sell this book." I didn't really believe we could sell any book that I wrote. So, I said, "All right, whatever. Take it out." She took it out. It sold. And then as soon as it sold, I panicked.

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 我说：“我们需要一个法律团队来处理这本书，因为我做了一些事情。大家知道我做了什么吗？”比如写信给**安·帕切特**，以及用**琼·迪迪恩**的口吻写作。所以，当时是这样。但我不知道安在读这本书。我的编辑把书给她，请她写推荐语。我当时不知道。我本不想问她。我不想以朋友的身份请求帮忙，但她确实为我读了，并非常慷慨地写了推荐语，然后她又告诉我：“我推荐你的书，因为它很好，我觉得它值得我所说的一切。”所以那真的很棒。您是在疫情期间开始写这本书的，这是您开始写的第八本书。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: I said, "We need to get a legal team in here with this book because I have done some things. Is everybody aware of the things I've done?" Like writing to **Anne Patchet** and writing in the voice of **Joan Ddian**. So, it was it was but then an I didn't know Ann was reading the book. My my editor got it to her to ask for a blurb. I wasn't aware of that. I would have I didn't want to ask her. I didn't want to pull a favor as a friend kind of thing, but she did read it for me and she blurbed it so generously and then she followed up and told me, "I blurbed your book because it's good and I think it deserved what I said." So, that was really neat. You started writing this book during the pandemic and it was you the eighth book you started to write.

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 是的，这是我第八部完整的长篇小说。我想我还有几部写了一半但没有完成的。但这是第八部。我19岁时开始写我的第一部小说，我今年39岁。所以那些年我几乎每天都在写作，大约从早上五点到七点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: Yes, this is my eighth complete novel. I think I have a few others that I started but didn't get all the way to the finish line. But this is the eighth one. I started writing my first novel when I was 19 and I'm 39. So, I was writing all that time pretty much every day of all those years from approximately 5:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m.

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 那一直是我的节奏。所以，我大概是在2020年末，或者2021年初开始写这本书的。我是在当时我们住的一个出租屋里一个非常小的衣柜里写的。我想我是在2021年全年写完的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: That was always my rhythm. So, I started writing this book, I think I was starting to write it at the end of 2020, maybe the beginning of 2021. And I wrote it inside of a very small closet in a rental that we were living in at the time. And I think I wrote it over the duration of 2021. I would say

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 这就像电影里那种老套的场景，画面定格，然后人物说：“你大概想知道我是怎么走到这一步的。”您是怎么走到这一步的？您19岁就开始写小说，这表明您一直想成为一名作家，而《**通讯员**》花了20年才真正让您以某种方式被大家所知。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: This is that cliche scene in a movie where there's a freeze frame and then the person says, "You're probably wondering how I got here. How did you get here? You started writing novels at the age of 19, which indicates to me that you always wanted to be a writer and it took these 20 years for **The Correspondent** to really be the one that announces you in some way.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 那20年里发生了什么？您在做什么？您如何养活自己？您是如何保持信心，或者您想用什么词来形容，就是一直坚持不懈地努力？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: What was happening over those 20 years? What were you doing? How were you supporting yourself? How did you keep up the confidence or whatever word you want to use to just keep plugging away at it?

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 当然，在我19岁、24岁、27岁和30岁的时候，我愿意付出一切让那些其他书成功。然而，那段时间我一直在生活，结婚生子，买房子，我们还在国外住过，做了这些不同的事情。所以从某种意义上说，当时我可能会说我希望情况有所不同，但现在我觉得我很幸运，我拥有了这一切。我拥有了我的生活和家庭。而现在，我又能实现这个令人惊叹的梦想。但我一直同时做着好几份工作。我总是全职照顾孩子，同时做着好几份工作。我在家工作，做过很多工作。我会在清晨写作，然后花几年时间写一本书，两三年，三四年。然后写完。早期的书我没有尝试去卖。我不知道怎么做。我没有任何人脉。我从来不认识任何作家。现在我认识了，但那时我从来不认识任何人。所以我不知道该怎么做，我不知道写完一本书后该做什么。所以，大概写了三本书之后，我开始尝试。我买了一本《作家年鉴》，就是我们以前用的那本大书。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: Of course, when I was 19 and 24 and 27 and 30, I would have given my right arm to have had one of those other books make it. However, what I was doing during that time was living and getting married and having my children and buying a house and we lived abroad and just doing these different things. And so in some ways at the time I would have said I wish it would have been different but now I feel like I lucked out like I got it all. Got to have my life and my family. And now at this moment, I get to have this other amazing dream come true. But I was always working multiple jobs. I always was taking care of my kids full-time and doing multiple jobs. I worked from home. I worked many jobs. I would write early in the morning and I would write a book over a few years, three, two, three, four years. And then I would get to the end. And then earlier books I didn't try to sell. I didn't know how. I don't have anybody. I never knew anyone who was a writer. and I don't have anyone in my world now. I do, but then I never knew anyone. So, I didn't know how to do I didn't know what you do when you finish writing a book. So, then I So, maybe three books in I started to I bought a writer's almanac, that big book that we used to use.

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 我自学了如何写一封查询信。然后我写了一封查询信。当然，我敢肯定那封信写得很糟糕。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: And taught myself how to write a query letter. So, then I wrote a query letter. Of course, it was terrible, I'm sure.

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 我发出了查询信。也许那时还没有电子邮件，我想我以前是用纸质信件寄出去的。然后我一本书一本书地自学，好吧，那不是一封好信。这封信写得更好。这真是一个学习经验，就是自学如何做这件事。然后，在第六本书之后，我确实找到了一位经纪人，那是我的第六本书，那是一本好书。我觉得它会成功，但后来我和那位经纪人的关系出了问题，我们分道扬镳了，她从未卖掉那本书。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: Sent out queries. Maybe it was pre sending them by email. I think I used to send them out by pay with paper. And then kind of book by book I taught myself, okay, that's not a good letter. This is a better letter. And it was such a learning experience just teaching myself how to do it. And then and then after the sixth book, I I had I actually did get an agent with my sixth book and that was a good book. I felt like it was going to going to make it to the finish line and then that relationship with that agent went sideways and we parted ways and she never sold the book. And so

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 那真的很难熬，也就是那时我们决定搬到国外。我们一直想带着家人去国外生活一段时间，只是为了离开美国一阵子。问题总是，人们是怎么做到的？谁能做到呢？所以我想我总有一天会想教书。我真的很喜欢教书。我想在监狱里教书。我想在监狱里教写作。所以当时我想我可能需要一个硕士学位。于是我开始寻找国外的项目。然后我们申请了几个英语国家的项目。我的孩子们当时分别是四岁、三岁，然后是五岁、三岁和六岁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: That was really tough and that's when we decided to move abroad and we had wanted to move with our family to live abroad just to get out of America for a while and and it was always the question of how do people do that? Like how can you who can do that? So I I thought I wanted to teach at some point. I really like teaching. I wanted to teach it in prisons. I want to teach writing in prisons. And so I was thinking I needed to probably have a master's degree. So I started looking at abroad programs. So then we I applied to a few different programs in English-speaking countries. My children were four, three and three and five, three and six.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Mhm.

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 我被几个项目录取了，所以我们选择了都柏林的**圣三一学院**。于是我们搬到了国外，卖掉了房子，辞掉了工作，把车给了我哥哥，诸如此类。把我们的狗借给了朋友们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: And I got into a couple of programs and so we went we chose **Trinity** in Dublin. So we moved abroad, we sold our house, we we quit our jobs, gave my brother my car, kind of those things. Loaned out our dog to some friends

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 然后我们搬到了爱尔兰。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: and then we moved to Ireland.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 当然。狗会很感激的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Sure. The dog appreciated that.

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 我们回来的时候它非常生气。那只狗不肯靠近我丈夫。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: She was so bitter when we got back. The dog wouldn't come near my husband.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 我无法想象为什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: I can't imagine why

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 他抛弃了我。所以我们住在那里。我们在都柏林住了一年，我师从**克莱尔·基根**、**卡洛·吉布勒**、**欧文·麦克纳米**以及其他一些爱尔兰大作家**凯文·鲍尔**等人，那段经历非常棒。我在那里写了一部很棒的小说作为我的课程作业。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: He left me. So, we lived there. We lived in Dublin for a year and I studied with **Claire Keegan** and **Carlo Gibbler** and **Owen Mcnami** and others **Kevin Power** big Irish writers and it was wonderful and I wrote a wonderful novel as my course work there.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 所以那是第七本书。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: So, that was book seven.

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 那是第七本书。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: That was book seven.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Mhm.

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 然后，当时是新冠疫情，我们正在争论是留在那里封锁，还是回家。我岳父患有帕金森病，我们担心如果他需要我们回去，我们可能回不去。所以我们回到了美国，从那时起就一直待在这里。那段时间，可能就是《**通讯员**》这本书的背景，它不是一本悲伤的书，但它是一本关于悲伤和失望的书。这可能是因为我们回来的时候，我正处于一种相当严重的悲伤和失望之中，有很多事情让我感到失望。所以后来我写了第八本书。第八本书就是那本最终成功了的。在写了六本书、七本书之后，您为什么还要继续写作？每天早上五点起床，埋头苦干，写完一本书，它就在那里，却卖不出去。您为什么还要开始下一本？又为什么还要开始下一本呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: And then we then it was COVID and we were debating do we stay there locked down there or do we come home and my father-in-law had Parkinson's and we were concerned that we couldn't get back if he needed us back. So we came back to the states and we've been back since. during that time. That was probably where **The Correspondent** is a book about, it's not a sad book, but it's a book about grief and disappointment. And that's probably because I was in a pretty significant place of grief and disappointment about a lot of things when we came back. So then I wrote book eight. And book eight is the one that finally made it to the finish line. Why did you keep writing after six books, after seven books? What it's waking up at 5 every morning, plugging away, finishing a book, having it there, not having it sell. Why did you start the next one? And why did you start the next one?

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 人们问我这个问题，我从来没想过要停下来，没想过要说，我觉得我不应该再做这件事了。我觉得一定有什么东西。我觉得对于作家来说，内心一定有什么东西，我总是觉得它像是在追逐你。如果有一个故事，一个想法，我感觉它在追逐我，而唯一能摆脱它的方法就是把它写出来。那就是，那就是，对我来说，那就是写作的生活。我就是这种感觉。我确实有过一个时刻，当这本书上市销售时，我们当时是合伙人。压力很大。我一直在想，我本可以赚钱的。我本可以赚钱的。我本可以赚钱的。我当时在工作，但我想我本可以有一份事业。所以我当时想，因为我总是把所有的创作精力都投入到书本上。所以我会有工作，但我从来没有真正开始一份事业，因为我以为我是一个作家。这就是我正在做的事情。所以我有过一个时刻，我当时想，我应该去读法学院。我会成为一名好律师。所以当这本书上市销售时，我开始研究法学院，因为我以为它不会卖出去，我就会浪费我的生命。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: It people ask me this, it never occurred to me to not to stop to to to say, I I think I should not do this anymore. I think there must be something. I think there must be something for people who are writers inside that I always feel like it's something chasing you. If there's some story, some idea, I feel that it's a thing chasing me and the only way to outrun it is to write it. And that's the that's the it's like that's the life. That's the life of writing to me. That's how it feels. I did have a moment when this book went out for sale and we were part up. It was stressful. I I kept thinking I could be making money. I could be making money. I could be making I was working jobs but like I could have a career. And so I thought cuz I had always kept it was like all my creative energy was always going to the books. So I would have jobs but I just never embarked on a career because I thought I'm going to I'm a writer. That's what I'm doing. And so I had this moment where I thought I should go to law school. I'd be a good lawyer. So I started to research law schools while this book was out for sale cuz I thought it's not going to sell and I'm going to be I'm wasting my wasting my life.

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 但我确实想过，我会停下来吗？还是会去读法学院，然后只是起得更早一点？我不知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: But I did think would I stop or would I go to law school and just keep getting up maybe a little earlier? I don't know.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 那听起来要兼顾的事情太多了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: That that seems like a lot to juggle.

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 是啊，是啊。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: Yeah. Well, yeah.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 您的孩子现在多大了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: How old are your kids now?

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 他们一个10岁，一个12岁。您今年都告诉他们什么了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: They're 10 and 12. What have you told them this past year?

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 他们真是好孩子。我想他们为我感到骄傲。我有一个有趣的时刻，去年我女儿三年级快结束的时候，我去学校接她，她上车后说学校举行了职业周活动，很多家长来给孩子们讲他们的职业，但他们没请我来。我当时想，好吧，我可以来谈谈做作家。反正，他们后来确实请我来了。所以我当时，我没有生气，也许我没有。她上车后，有点安静，我从后视镜里看她，我说：“你在想什么？”她说：“妈妈，您是作家吗？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: They're such troopers. I think they're proud of me. I had this one funny moment, my daughter last year when she was in it was the end of her third grade year. I picked her up from school and she got in the car and she said it was career week at school and they had all these parents come in to speak to the children about their career and they didn't ask me to come and I was well I will I could come talk about being a writer. Anyway, they did ask me to come. And so I was I wasn't bitter, but maybe I wasn't. And so I She gets in the car and she said, she kind of gets in. She's a little quiet and I looked in the mirror. I said, "What are you thinking about?" And she said, "Mom, are you a writer?"

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 她说：“您是作者吗？”我说：“是啊。”我说：“是啊，您知道我是。”她点了点头。我说：“您为什么问我？”她说：“今天我们轮流讲我们父母是做什么的。”我说：“我妈妈是作者。”他们不相信我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: She said, "Are you an author?" I said, "Yeah." I said, "Yeah, you know that I am." She said, she nodded. I said, "Why are you asking me?" And she said, "Today we went around to talk tell her what our parents do." And I said, "My mom's an author." And they didn't believe me.

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 所以第二天我让她带上我的书，书后面有我的照片。我说：“把这个给他们看。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: And so I sent her, the next day I sent her with my book, which has my picture in the back. And I said, "Show them this."

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 您把这个给班上所有人看。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: You show this to everyone in your class.

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 我这样做是不是很幼稚？但我确实那样做了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: How like juvenile is that of me? But I did do that.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 他们呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Are they?

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 她当时很得意。她说：“他们现在相信我了。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: She was pretty She was smug the next day. She said, "They believe me now."

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 他们在电视上见过您吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Do they Have they seen you on TV?

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 是的，他们见过。他们说上周我在电视上的时候，他们很想来，但我们只去了纽约24小时。我们住在北卡罗来纳州。所以我们把他们留给了保姆，他们看了节目。我回来后问：“你们觉得我表现得怎么样？”他们说：“您表现得很好。”我说：“谢谢。”我女儿说：“您没讲太久，而且只谈了自己一分钟。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: Yes, they have. They said last week when I was on TV, they really wanted to come, but I we just went up for like 24 hours to New York. We live in North Carolina. And so we left them with a babysitter and they watched the show and I got back and I said, "How do you think I did?" And they said, "You did fine." And I said, "Thanks." And my daughter said, "You didn't talk very long and you only talked about yourself for one minute."

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 所以她觉得我需要更多的关注。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: So she thought I needed more of a spotlight.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 哇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Wow.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 这些孩子有很多意见。

<details>

**Virginia Evans**: 是的，他们确实有很多意见。我穿了什么？我说了什么？我的眼镜，所有这些。

### 书信体小说的魅力

**Gilbert Cruz**: 欢迎回来。这里是书评播客，我是**Gilbert Cruz**。我正在和《**通讯员**》的作者**弗吉尼亚·埃文斯**交谈。**西比尔**的故事，您有没有想过以其他形式呈现，还是它总是通过信件来展开的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Welcome back. This is the **Book Review Podcast** and I'm **Gilbert Cruz**. I'm speaking with **Virginia Evans**, author of **The Correspondent**. Did **Sibil**'s story here, did you ever see it in your mind in any other form or was it always through letters that her story was going to unfold?

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 它只能通过信件来呈现。我想我确实是从信件开始的，然后**西比尔**紧随其后。疫情期间，我和我的读书俱乐部一起读了一本叫《**查令十字街84号**》的书信体小说，那是一次非常愉快的阅读体验。我觉得那种互动式的书信阅读体验在疫情期间感觉非常清新，当时你的思绪，我不知道，感觉一切都那么混乱、奇怪、压抑和孤独。那本书感觉就像是所有这些的解药，但它太短了，我一天就读完了，我非常希望它能一直写下去。那时我的书卖不出去，我的经纪人说你应该开始写点别的。您知道每个人都说，写你想读的东西。所以那是我当时想读的。所以我就想，好吧，也许我可以扩展这个概念，把它变成一部传奇，一部史诗，或者像一个完整的人生。所以您是从书信写作的想法开始的。**西比尔**紧随其后。您是如何勾勒出她的人生轨迹的？您是什么时候知道她的人生弧线会是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: It was only through letters. I think really letters is where I started and I and **Sibil** came right after that. I I had read a book in letters **84 Charing Cross Road** during COVID with my book club and it was such a delightful reading experience and I thought that interactive reading experience of letters felt so refreshing during co and when your mind is I don't know it just felt like everything was so chaotic and weird and depressing and lonely and That book felt like the antidote to all of that, but it was so short and I finished it in one day and I wanted so badly for it to go on and on. That was when my book wasn't selling and my agent was saying you should start writing something else. And you know what everybody says, you write what you want to read. So that was what I wanted to read. So I just thought, okay, well maybe I could expand this concept and turn it into a saga, an epic or something like a whole life. So you started with the idea of letter writing. **Syibble** came next. How did you tease her life out? When did you know what the arc of her life was going to be?

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 当**西比尔**来到我身边时，她是以一个完全成形的角色出现的。她的声音，她沟通的方式，她的个性，她的样子，所有的一切，就像她就出现在我身边。我能看到她。我感觉她在我开始写作时非常触手可及，而且我知道她两件事。一是她有一个孩子早逝。她是一个老年女性，她的孩子在她年轻时就去世了。我知道她有过一份重要的事业。所以这就是我了解她的两件事。这些是她的主要支柱。我可能也知道我不想写一本悲惨的书。我想写一本读起来感觉良好、充满希望、最终走向救赎的书，这有时并不流行，但那就是我知道我想写的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: When **Cybil** came to me, which she did arrive fully formed to me. Her voice, the way she communicates, her personality, what she looked like it all, it's like she just she arrived right here, right beside me. I could see her. I felt she was very accessible when I started to write and I knew two things about her. One was that she had a child die early. She was an older woman and she had had a child die when the child was young and she was young and I knew she had had a big career. So those were the two things I knew about her. Those were kind of the main stays of her. And I probably knew that I wasn't wanting to write a miserable book. I was wanting to write a book that felt good to read and hopeful and ultimately towards redemptive, which is sometimes not in fashion, but that's what I knew I wanted to write.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 考虑到这本书如此多的内容都充满了悲伤，您认为您是如何做到这一点的？您了解了她失去孩子的故事。您是否了解到她是被收养的，童年艰难，经常感到孤独或孤单？您是如何将这些元素融入一个最终充满希望的故事中的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: How do you think you accomplished that given that so so much of this book is sad? You learn about the loss of her child. Did you learn that she was adopted and had a tough childhood where she often felt lonely or alone? How were you able to take those and make it into a story that, as you say, has uplift at the end?

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 我记得我奶奶患阿尔茨海默病去世的时候，她是一个娇小的南方美人，当时她已经到了生命的尽头，她患阿尔茨海默病很久了。我记得她去世时我还在上高中，她会整天坐在躺椅上看电视。可爱的小奶奶坐在她的椅子上，她旁边放着一个碗，每天早上我爷爷都会把碗里装满**安迪薄荷糖**，就是那种独立包装的绿色巧克力薄荷糖。她会整天非常缓慢地剥开这些薄荷糖，基本上要花一整天才能吃完一整碗。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: I remember when my grandmother was dying with Alzheimer's and she was this tiny little southern cutie and she was at the end of her kind of she had Alzheimer's for a long time. I was in high school I think when she died and I remember she would sit in this recliner and watch TV all day. little cute grandma sitting, grandma me sitting on her chair and she had this bowl and she set the bowl next to her and it would be every morning my grandfather would fill it with **Andy's mints**, those chocolate mint like individually wrapped green things and she would sit all day and very slowly unwrap these mints and it would take her the day to eat the whole bowl basically.

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 这就是她每天做的事情。我记得我妈妈谈到这件事时笑得很开心，她就是忍不住笑。那时我奶奶已经没有语言能力了，但她很开心，非常快乐。我记得我妈妈说：“如果你不笑，你就会哭。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: And this is what she did every day. And I remember my mother talking about this and laughing so hard and she just was cracking up about this. And at this point, my grandmother didn't have any language left and she just was but she was delightful. She was just happy as could be. And I remember my mom saying, "If you don't laugh about it, you'll cry."

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 我觉得，要面对。我想每个人的生活都很艰难。我不认为有人能轻松愉快地度过一生。我想每个人都会觉得“你不会相信我经历了什么”，即使是以奇怪而独特的方式，秘密的或者谁知道呢。但我认为我想要做的就是真正展现一个真实完整的人生是怎样的，或者说是某人生活的100或360度全景的一个例子，但我希望以一种让你不会感到被压垮的方式来讲述它。所以书中有幽默。我不认为自己是一个幽默或喜剧作家，但我确实认为书中和**西比尔**身上发生了很多有趣的事情，她很有趣，发生的事情也很有趣。而且，我只是觉得生活就是喜悦与悲伤的平衡。我认为这本书很好地平衡了喜悦与悲伤。也许我们都可以读它，然后说：“是的，生活就是这样，你知道，就是这样。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: And I feel like to approach I think everybody's life is hard and tough. I don't think anybody gets through their life and thinks well I had a really good fun easy go of it. I think everybody feels like you wouldn't believe what I've been through even in weird unique ways that are secret or who knows. But I think that's what I was wanting to do was to really show what a real whole life is like or one example of a 100 or 360°ree view of someone's life, but I wanted to tell it in a way that you didn't feel crushed crushed by it. And so there's humor. There's humor in it. I don't think of myself as like a like funny or comedic writer, but I do think the a lot of things that happen in the book and **Syibble** are funny and she is funny and things that happen are funny. And also just that I just think all of life is this balance of joy and sorrow. And I think the book is a pretty good balance of joy and sorrow. And maybe we can all read it and say, "Yeah, that is what it's like, you know, what it's like."

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 我会说，一开始我感觉这位女士有点脾气暴躁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: I will say early on I was like this lady is something she's real contankerous. She's

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: Yes.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 我可不想收到她这种信。她让我很恼火。显然，在整本书的过程中，您扩展并充实了她，她变成了一个让读者既理解又欣赏她声音的人，而在开头您可能会想，这会是一个抱怨信件里所有事情的老太太吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: I would not want to get this kind of letter from her. She's pissing me off. Obviously over the course of the book you expand her and flesh her out and she becomes someone who you the read as the reader you both understand and come to appreciate her voice in a way whereas the beginning you're like is this one just going to be one of those old ladies who complains about everything in letters?

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 那个声音是从哪里来的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Where did that voice come from?

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 当我遇到她时，当她出现时，我想，好吧，她就是这样的人。每个人之所以是他们现在的样子，都有其原因。每个人都是他们所经历的、被赋予的生活、他们的成长环境的产物。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: When I met her, when she arrived, I thought, okay, this is the way she is. Everybody's the way they are for a reason. Everybody is the product of the experiences that they've had, the life that they were given, their upbringing.

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 这感觉像是一个挑战，但也是一个令人愉快的挖掘项目，去了解像她这样的人，我同意她一开始并不讨人喜欢，但当您拂去所有的尘埃，不断挖掘，揭开埋藏在地下的东西时，您会说：“哦！”然后就会有那么多的欣赏。我想您会对一个人产生如此多的欣赏，即使您一开始觉得“我只是喜欢那个。”我想这也许就是故事的希望所在。我想每个人都是这样。我想每个人都是这样。我第一次开始构思这本书，它开始在我脑海中具体化时，我还没有真正开始写作，但这个想法已经完全清晰了。我遇到了一位女士，我们想从她那里买房子，她让我们过去看看房子，走一遍。我记得她打开房门，她让我想起我印象中**西比尔**的样子。娇小，打扮得非常得体，就像她在周二家里穿得比我一生中任何时候都好。熨烫过的裤子，头发也打理好了。她大概七十多岁。她打开门，她就是这样一个娇小、90磅重的人。您会先对这位老太太有一个初步的印象。但后来我们参观了房子，和她聊了几个小时，她一直在告诉我们她在这所房子里住了40年，然后一件事引出另一件事。您了解了所有这些不同的事情，这非常引人入胜，她本人也如此引人入胜。当我离开那所房子时，我想我那天回家就开始写这本书了，因为对我来说，那就是。您看到一个人，那是一回事。但如果您走进屋里，一间间地走，打开抽屉和衣柜，看看床底下，拉开床单，打开冰箱，那么您就开始了解一个人了。我觉得这有点像我试图用这个故事来做的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: And it was it felt like a challenge but an sort of an enjoyable excavation project to take someone like that who I agree is not likable at the beginning and but to say but when you dust out all the dust and you keep picking away and you unear the thing that's buried in the earth it's you say Oh, and then there's so much appreciation. I think you could have so much appreciation for someone even if you thought I just liked that. I I that's maybe the hopefulness of the story. I think that's everybody. I think that's just everybody. And I was I had this experience when I was first starting to come up with the book and it was starting to materialize for me as I was be I hadn't really begun to write but the idea was coming into full relief and I met this woman this we wanted to buy this house from this woman and she had us come over to to see it to walk through it and she was I remember she opened the door of the house And she's she reminds me of the way I imagine **Syibble** looks. Petite, very put together, like better dressed on a Tuesday in her house than I've ever dressed in my life. Like depressed, trousers and hair done. And she's probably in her mid70s. And she opens the door and she's this just tiny little 90 lb person. And you have this first snap of this kind of older lady. Close the book. But then we went through the house and we spent a couple hours with her and she was just telling us about how she had lived in this house for 40 years and every one thing leads to another. You learn all these different things and it was so fascinating and she was so fascinating and when I left the house that was I think I went home and started writing the book that day because that was it to me. you see someone, it's this one thing. But then if you go inside and you walk room to room and you open the drawers and the closets and look under the bed and pull back the sheets and open the refrigerator, then you know somebody, you start to know somebody. And that felt a little bit like what I was trying to do with the story of

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 有没有特别难写或难以攻克的段落？我想象这本书有些部分是水到渠成，有些则比较困难。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Were there passages that were particularly hard to write or hard to crack? I have to imagine that some of the book flowed and some was a little more difficult.

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 最难写的部分无疑是那些深入探讨悲伤具体细节和可怕事件的信件。其中有一封**西比尔**收到的来自她住在国外的**前夫**的信。那封信很难写，因为它很痛苦。他死于癌症，深入他的情感、他的恐惧或他对死亡的看法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: The hardest ones to write were definitely the letters that get into the specifics of grief and the specifics of the horrible things that have happened. And there's one letter that **Syibil** receives from her ex-husband who lives abroad. And that letter was hard to write because it's painful. He's dying of cancer and getting into the river of his emotions and his fears or thoughts on dying.

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 作为一个作家，试图进入那种精神状态是可怕的，因为您也在某种程度上进入了自己的那种精神状态。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: trying to get into that headsp space is scary as a writer because you're getting into that headsp space for yourself in a way and

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 这需要，我不知道，这需要一些勇气去说“我愿意去那里”。所以他写给她的那封信，在他生命即将结束时写的，很难写。我记得那天早上七点我从衣柜里出来，太阳已经升起来了，我还没见过太阳，我记得我当时脑子一片混乱，然后我的孩子们说：“妈妈，我能吃华夫饼吗？”我说：“我不能，我现在真的不能。”所以那是其中一个。当**西比尔**最终详细讲述她儿子是如何去世的时候，那真的非常痛苦。写那本书的时候，我儿子八岁，而她儿子也是八岁时去世的。我故意这样做，因为我试图在脑海中想象，如果我的儿子去世了会是怎样。所以在我写作的时候，我总是试图，无论何时我写她的任何信件，即使没有谈到她儿子的死，我都会试图在脑海中保持那种感觉，就像如果我的儿子**杰克**，他现在八岁，或者现在他12岁，但当时他八岁，她所失去的那个孩子就是那个年龄。所以当我最终写出并详细描述这些细节时，感觉很痛苦，因为我真的只能想象我自己的孩子的身体。然后我想说，这也很具挑战性。故事中有一个角色是一个男孩，他从青春期成长为青年，他，虽然没有明确提及，但您可以推断他患有自闭症谱系障碍。那些信件需要非常小心地处理，才能让我觉得它们真实可信。我修改了数百次，以确保感觉是对的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: it takes I don't know does it take some like courage to say I'm willing to go there and so that letter his letter that he writes to her kind of at the end of his life was hard to write and I I I remember coming out of the closet at 7:00 that morning and the sun's up and I haven't seen the sun yet and I remember being out of my I couldn't think straight and then my kids are like, "Mom, can I have waffles?" And I was like, "I don't I can't I really can't right now." So, that was one. It was really painful to write the ex when **Sibil** finally hashes out how her son died. That was really hard to write. When I was writing the book, my son was 8 and her son died at 8. And I did that on purpose because I was trying to get there in my mind of what it would be like if my if my son died. And I so while I was writing it, I was always trying to ch anytime I was writing any of her letters, even if it wasn't talking about the death of her son, I was trying to have that presence of mind in my head as if what if mine, my son **Jack**, who's eight right now, or now he's 12, but he was eight, that's who she is dealing with that she has lost is at that age. And so when I when I finally wrote and hashed out the details of that, it felt painful because I was really I could only imagine even the physical body of my own my own kid. And then I would say it was also challenging. There's a character in the story who is a boy and he goes from adolescence into young adulthood and he is it's not mentioned specifically but you can infer that he is on the autism spectrum. And those letters took a lot of care to get to where I felt like they were they felt authentic and and accurate and I revised them hundreds of times to make sure it felt right.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 您有没有发现自己会调整信件的顺序？比如，您是如何实际构建这本书的，关于哪封信放在哪里，信息流如何进行？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Did you find yourself moving the order of letters around? like how did you actually structure the book in terms of okay this one goes here and this one goes here and the information flow is going to happen this way

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 这实际上是书信写作这种机制的宽容之处，因为移动一封信并更改日期是相对容易的。而在传统的叙事结构中，要重新安排所有内容以使其契合、流畅，您在传统的叙事中就像在路上行走，一直在路上行走。而在这本书中，您几乎就像在**《布雷迪一家》**的电视屏幕中，您在这里，然后您在那里，然后您又在这里，您不是在路上行走。所以您可以随时跳进任何一个电视屏幕，它不会让人觉得突兀。也许对读者来说会有些突兀，但叙事结构允许这样做。所以当我不得不移动内容时，感觉很简单。只是移动它，更改日期，确保它符合季节。如果六月下雪了，我需要确保这种情况不会发生。但实际上在早期印刷版本中，有几个日期是错误的，因为我移动了内容，然后错误地标注了日期等等。我想现在已经修复了。但是的，我确实调整了顺序，但我确实觉得这比修改我写过的其他“在路上行走”的书要容易。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: that is actually the forgiving part about this mechanism of letter writing because it's easy easy relative term but it's simple to move a letter and change the date whereas in a traditional narrative structure reworking everything to make things fit together to make things flow. You're in a traditional narrative, you're walking down the road and you're walking down the road. You're walking down the road. In this one, you are almost like in **Brady Bunch** TV screens, like you're here and then you're here and then you're here and you're not walking down the road. So, you can pop into any TV screen at any time and it doesn't it's not jarring. Maybe it is jarring to the reader, but it doesn't the narrative structure allows for that. And so, when I did have to move things, it felt simple. just move it, change the date, make sure it's like seasonally appropriate. If it was snowing in June, I need to make sure that's not happening. But, and actually in the early printings, there were a couple dates that were wrong because I had moved things and then mislabeled the dates and stuff. I think that's been fixed. But yeah, I did move it around, but I did feel like that was actually easier than revising other books I've written where you're walking on the road.

</details>

### 书信写作的传统与未来

**Gilbert Cruz**: 我想问您关于书信写作的事情。我想问您关于这种人们不再做的事情。也许这也是这本书吸引力的一部分，它在某种程度上让人觉得复古，就是这种我年轻时或大学时可能做过的事情。您是什么时候开始写信的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: I want to ask you about letterw writing. I want to ask you about this thing that people don't really do anymore. And maybe that's part of the appeal of this book, which is it feels retro to some people in some way, which is here's this thing that maybe I used to do when I was younger or when I was in college. When did you start writing letters?

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 我一直都在写信，现在也还在写。所以对我来说，这在概念上可能不是一个遥不可及的事情，但我只是觉得我一直都在写信。我总是会记下笔记，很有趣，您之前问我有没有想过要成为一名作家，我没有，但我不是来自一个把写作视为选择或我会考虑的家庭或世界，但我认为我一直在写作。我写信，我写故事，写一些谁知道是什么的小页，总是记下东西，我现在也还在这样做，我确实写信。我想有些人对我说，他们被教导要写感谢信，那是他们开始书信写作的开端，但我不是，因为我不是在南方长大的。我没有被教导必须写感谢信，但我一直保持着某种通信。直到现在，如果我读到一本我喜欢的书，我就会写信给作者，告诉他们我喜欢它的什么。或者我丈夫给我买了一件来自英格兰康沃尔海岸一位艺术家的精美艺术品，我想他做的是一种版画，分层版画。那真的很棒。我收到了这件艺术品，我写信给他，告诉他它挂在哪里，以及它对我意味着什么。他给我回了一封很漂亮的信。他八十多岁了，他说这个时代，我们创作这种艺术，我们培养人们创作这种艺术，然后我们写信告诉艺术家，所有这些，我看到它不会再存在很久了，因为人们不再做这些了。这真的很有趣。但我只是觉得有些东西非常美妙。我想没有什么感觉能比得上走到您的邮箱前，打开它，里面有一封给您的信。我想没有其他感觉能与之相同。所以我就是喜欢它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: I've always written letters and I still do. And so that is probably this is less of a far reach for me conceptually, but I think I just I've always written letters. I've always jot jotted down notes and it's funny you had said to me earlier did you wonder did you always think you wanted to be a writer and I didn't but I didn't I didn't come from a family or a world where that was an option or something I would have ever even considered but I think I was always writing I was writing letters and I was writing story like little pages of who knows what always jotting down and I still do that and I do write letters and I think I I some people say to me that they were taught to write thank you notes and that was their foray into letter writing and that wasn't cuz I wasn't raised in the south. I wasn't taught that I had to write a thank you note, but but I have I've just always kept up some kind of correspondence and into now I will if I read a book that I love, I'll write to the author and say this is what I loved about it or I got that my husband got me this beautiful piece of art from this artist on the coast of England in Cornwall I think and he does this one type one type of block printing like layered block printing. It's really fabulous. and I received this piece of art and I wrote to him to tell him where it was hanging and why how it was going to what it meant to me. And he wrote me back this beautiful letter. He's 80some years old and he said this whole era of life where we make this type of art and we apprentice people to make this type of art and then we write a letter to tell the artists this is all something that I see is not going to be here very much longer because people aren't doing this anymore. It's really interesting. But I just find there's something so wonderful. I I don't think there is any other feeling than going to your mailbox and opening it and there is a letter to you. I don't think there's anything that feels like that other that's the same. So I just like it.

**Gilbert Cruz**: like actual letters in the mail.

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 每周数百封。每周数百封。我想对大家说，我忙不过来。我真的忙不过来。我想说，写信给别人，这样您就能养成写信的习惯。我现在有了合适的读者群。我几乎连牙都刷不了了。我简直是每小时跑100英里。

And I want to say write to someone that then you could get into the habit of writing. I got the right audience at this point. I can hardly brush my teeth. I'm just like going 100 miles an hour.

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 但我喜欢收到它们。但我想，我不想让它们在我这里被浪费。我希望它们被寄给别人。把信寄给**Gilbert**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: But I love to receive them. But then I think I don't want it to be wasted on me. I want it to be sent to someone that Send a letter to **Gilbert**.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 天哪。您觉得写信能做到哪些发邮件做不到的事情？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: Oh my gosh. What do you think you can do in a letter that maybe you can't do uh in an email, for example?

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 我觉得电子邮件感觉太容易、太随意了。我收到过有意义的、表达情感的电子邮件，但那不一样。是不是与实物有关？我家有几封信被裱起来了，因为它们是文物。那是笔迹。那是纸张。那是，嗯，这是一个很好的例子。有一本书叫《**把事情搞对的幸福**》。它记录了爱尔兰作家**弗兰克·奥康纳**和他在纽约的编辑**比尔·麦克斯韦尔**之间长达25年的通信。这本书就是他们的信件。您一定要读这本书。它太美了。它讲述了他们的关系，也讲述了他们的作品。令人震惊。它已经绝版了，但您可以从旧书店订购。所以我为自己订了一本。我读过它。我订了一本，它寄来了，我打开时，一张纸掉了出来，那是**弗兰克·奥康纳**的妻子**哈里特·奥多诺万·希伊**写的一封信。上面写着“致以我最诚挚的问候，**哈里特·奥多诺万·希伊**。”那是她把她丈夫的这本信件集送给某人。那一刻我感觉就像回到了过去，他们就在那里。我能看到我丈夫随手写下，就像一份副本：“这是弗吉尼亚的书。寄出去。”我把那张小纸条裱起来放在我的书房里，因为它很有意义。

**Virginia Evans**: I think an email feels so easy and so casual and I don't I've received emails that are meaningful that's express sentiment, but it's not the same. Is it something about the physical artifact? There's several letters that are framed in my house that are it's cuz it's an artifact. It's the handwriting. It's the paper. It's the um it's I Okay, this is a good example. I There's a book that is called **The Happiness of Getting It Down Right**. And it's the correspondence, the letters back and forth between **Frank Oconor**, the Irish writer, and **Bill Maxwell**, his editor in New York, over the over their 25 year relationship of Bill being Frank's editor. And the book is their letters. You have to read this book. It's just beautiful. And it's about their relationship, and it's also about the work. And it's staggering. And I it's out of print, but you can order copies from used book places. And so I ordered a copy for myself. I had read it. I ordered a copy and it came and I opened it and this piece of paper fell out and it was a letter from **Frank O' Conor**'s wife, **Harriet O'Donovan Sheehy**. And it said with my warmest regards, **Harriet O'Donovan Sheihi**. And it was she was giving this book of her husband's letters to someone. And it just felt like this moment where I thought this is like reaching back and they're right there. I could see my husband like jotting down like a copy. Here's Virginia's book. Send it off. And I have that framed on my in my study, that little note from her because it means something.

### 新书展望与坚持不懈

**Gilbert Cruz**: 您可能还要为《**通讯员**》的宣传工作一段时间，谁知道呢？您已经开始写下一本书了吗？还是您打算回顾一下您写过的其他七本书，然后说：“好吧，也许现在是我可以重新审视这些书的时候了，因为我现在在出版界有了一点门路，这是我以前没有的。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: You will probably be working on publicity for **The Correspondent** for a while, a little bit longer. Who's to say? are have you started your next book or are you going back to the some of the other seven books that you've written and are you saying all right maybe now is the moment where I can return to some of these now that I have a bit of an entree maybe into the publishing world where I didn't have before

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 我在新书上进展非常顺利，我在这本书真正出版之前就开始写它了，这也是我多年来一直这样做却没有任何成功的益处，就是我总是会开始写新东西。所以有作品对我来说非常重要。如果我不写作，我就无法很好地工作。所以这就是让我脚踏实地的原因。所以这很有帮助，因为它让我坚持下去，而不是迷失在正在发生的一切的疯狂之中。但我确实在大约一年前或一年多一点的时候开始写这本书，我的意思是，今天您问我，我今天简直要抓狂了。但总的来说，我想说进展非常顺利，我有一个非常好的扎实的初稿，我对此很兴奋。我真的对此很兴奋。然后我想，当那本书，希望我们能卖掉那本书。我仍然对能否卖掉一本书持怀疑态度。我心想，我希望有人会买它。我的经纪人说，一定会有人买的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: I am really far along on a new book I started writing it before the book really came out and it which this is the benefit of all the years I was always doing this and with no success is that I just would always start something new and so it's very grounding for me to have the work. It's very very I'm not able to function well if I'm not writing something and so this is what keeps my feet on the ground as the work. So that's helpful because it makes me stay with it instead of getting lost in the madness of what's going on. But I did start writing this book about a year ago or a little over a year and it's I mean in today ask me today I was like pulling my hair out today. But in general I would say it's going really well and I have a really good solid first draft and I'm excited about it. I'm really excited about it. And then I think when that book hopefully we'll sell that book. I still feel such a skeptical sense of being able to sell a book. I'm like I hope somebody will buy it. My agent's like somebody will buy it. story.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 现在感觉怎么样？就像，“好吧，也许我真的能卖掉下一本书了。”您是否会一直，或者至少在一段时间内，有那种“我不知道这本书会不会成功”的感觉？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: How does it feel to be like, "Okay, now maybe I can actually sell this next book." Is it are you always going to have or maybe for a while have that sense of I don't know if this one's going to work?

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 绝对会。可能永远都会。我花了很多时间才练就那种厚脸皮和怀疑精神，我想它不会消失的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: Absolutely. Probably forever. It took me a long time to like get that thick skin and skepticism and I don't think it's going to go away.

</details>

**Gilbert Cruz**: 您会被问到这个问题很多次。很多人会向您寻求建议。您是如何坚持下来的？在一次又一次被拒绝之后，您是如何继续前进的？您是如何培养出那种必要的厚脸皮或毅力，让您写到第八本书的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilbert Cruz**: You're going to get asked this question so many times. So many people are going to ask you advice. How do you persist? How do you keep going after being told no over and over again? What did it take to develop the type of thick skin or persistence that was necessary for you to get to book number eight?

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 我的作品被拒绝过数千次。经纪人，我向纽约市的每一位经纪人都发过查询信。每一个人。而我的经纪人在多伦多。我把纽约市的名单都用完了。现在我有了这位很棒的经纪人，谢天谢地，她在多伦多。我有几本书和编辑合作过，总是被拒绝，更不用说我做过的所有小事情了。我只是觉得，听到“不”和“不够好”，我确切地知道，从我身边非常亲近的人那里得到的消息，并不是每个人都有这种承受能力。但出于某种原因，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: I was rejected thousands of times for my work. Agents, I've queried every agent in New York City. Everyone. And my agent is in Toronto. I exhausted the list in New York City. And now I have this amazing agent, thank goodness, in Toronto. I had the couple of books out with editors, always rejected, not to mention all the small things I've done. And I just think hearing no and it's not good enough. I know for a fact on good authority from people that are very close to me that is not something everybody has the stomach for. But for some reason,

</details>

**Virginia Evans**: 我只是想，好吧，我可以做得更好。我可以做得更好。我可以做得更好。这始终在我脑海中盘旋。我想我可以做得更好。这就是我写新书时的想法。我可以做得更好。我想我可以做得更好。我喜欢这样。我想因为我确实认为我可能总是可以做得更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Virginia Evans**: I just thought, okay, I can do better. I can do better. I can do better. And that was just always what was rattling around in my head. I think I can do better. That's what I think when I'm working on this new book. I can do better. I think I can do better. Which I like. I think because I do think I can probably always do better.
