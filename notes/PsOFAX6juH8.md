### 周五市场回顾与PCE数据

大家好，欢迎回到新一期的市场收盘节目。今天是12月5日，星期五，我们正在直播。今天盘中并没有发生太多疯狂的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market close. It is Friday, December 5th. We are live. And well, you didn't have that much crazy stuff happen throughout the day.</p>
</details>

**标普500指数**（Standard & Poor's 500: 标准普尔500指数，一个追踪美国500家大型上市公司股票表现的指数）相对平稳。早上我们确实有过一次大幅上涨，几乎突破了688，具体是688.39。但现在我们又回到了685。所以实际上，早上的那波相当看涨的行情基本上被抹平了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, S&P 500 relatively flat. We did get a big move almost in the morning above 688, 688.39. We are right back to 685. So, realistically, the move that we got in the morning, which was pretty bullish, basically flattened out.</p>
</details>

事实就是如此。总的来说，这是不错的一周，上涨了约1.2%，所以我不能抱怨太多。不过，在这个周五，并没有太多疯狂的头条新闻或市场波动。本周需要发生的大部分事情都已经发生了。早上的**PCE**（Personal Consumption Expenditures: 个人消费支出价格指数，美联储衡量通货膨胀的重要指标）数据很重要，它符合预期，在某些方面甚至比预期还要好。市场最终没有因为这个消息而上涨或下跌，但这正是维持市场稳定所需要的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it is what it is. I mean, it's been a overall good week up about 1.2% so I can't complain too much. Um, but there weren't that many crazy headlines or swings on this type of a Friday. And you know, most of the stuff that needed to happen throughout the week kind of happened. PCE in the morning was important. Came in line with expectations in some respects were even better than expectations. Market ultimately didn't go up or down based on the news. Uh, but it was what you needed to kind of keep the market stable.</p>
</details>

Meta上涨了1.72%。随着比特币下跌，Robin Hood下跌了约4%。英伟达未能突破184。Netflix则回落了3%。我们今天会更多地讨论Netflix和华纳兄弟的事情，这是今天早上的重磅消息。Netflix的股价下跌了3%，等Steve加入节目时，我们会听听他的看法。Palantir突破了182，目前在181.64，上涨了约2%。Salesforce和Adobe表现出色，Salesforce在财报后做出反应，而Adobe则在财报前上涨。所以，Salesforce和Adobe都获得了一些上涨动力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Meta's up 1.72%. Robin Hood lost about 4% as Bitcoin came down. Nvidia could not break above 184. Netflix right back down 3%. We'll talk more about this Netflix Warner Brothers stuff today. Uh, which was the big announcement of the morning. Stock for Netflix is down 3% and when Steve joins the show, we'll get his take on that. Palantir broke through 182 right now at 181.64. That's up about 2%. Salesforce and Adobe great days. Those Salesforce now reacting after earnings and Adobe reacting before their earnings. So, you're getting Salesforce and Adobe getting some more momentum.</p>
</details>

然后，华纳兄弟实际上正在追赶他们需要被收购的价格27.50美元，目前股价在26美元。Netflix下跌，华纳兄弟上涨。所以市场可能正在定价Netflix最终完成这次收购的可能性更高，因为华纳兄弟的价格越来越接近收购价，而如果Netflix需要支付这笔钱，其股价显然会下跌。不过，从监管角度来看，这个故事可能会比今天持续更长时间。特斯拉目前在454美元，是上涨的。以太坊则在努力守住3000美元大关。我甚至没注意到它跌破了三千。看，它从2986反弹了。至于比特币，我离开时是91，现在又回到了89。所以比特币继续在85到93这个区间内震荡。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then Warner Brothers actually catching up to the price that they need to be sold at at 27.50. Right now, it's at 26. Netflix is down. Warner Brothers up. So maybe the market's pricing in more of a shot that Netflix ends up completing this acquisition as Warner Bros. is getting closer to that acquisition price and obviously Netflix would go down if they have to pay that money. Um, but this might be a much longer story than just today to see when this plays out from a regulatory perspective. Tesla right here at 454. That's green. Ethereum begging to hold on to 3,000. I didn't even see it fell below three. Look at that. 29.86 it bounced off of. And then Bitcoin when I left we were at 91 and now we're back at 89. So, Bitcoin continues to oscillate around this 85 to 93 type of range.</p>
</details>

### 焦点：标普500指数成分股调整在即

关于标普500指数，我可能整个节目都要重复这一点，但我知道会有很多新观众加入。结果要到东部时间下午5:15才会公布。东部时间下午5:15。事实上，我会在评论区置顶关于标普500成分股调整结果的消息。所以，对于那些只关心这个的人来说，你们只需要再等大约一个半小时。然后我们就会看到结果如何。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In terms of S&P 500, so I'm going to have to say this pretty much throughout the entire show, but I know a lot of new people will be joining. The results will not be out until 5:15 p.m. Eastern. 5:15 p.m. Eastern. In fact, I'll just pin that comment right here for SNP inclusion results. So, for those that only care about that, you're just going to have to wait about an hour, hour and a half. Um, and then we will see what those earnings look like or not earnings, but what the rebounds looks like.</p>
</details>

有一些可能入选的公司。我想有些人可能忘记了一些候选者。Marvell在入选名单上，我甚至都没意识到他们不在标普500里。Carvana也在名单上，股价回到了每股400美元。早上我们还谈到了Reddit、MicroStrategy、Viva Systems、VRT（数据中心的液冷解决方案公司），VRT今天上涨了约3.2%，达到18.84。实际上，很多这些名字今天都在上涨，也许它们在预演被纳入标普500。看Reddit，今天上涨了5%，这可能是一个信号，也可能只是噪音，如果最终没有入选的话。Viva基本持平。而SoFi在宣布15亿美元的稀释后下跌了约6.6%。这只股票上次稀释后也一直没有真正恢复过来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The companies that could get in. So, there's a couple candidates I think some people forgot that could um that could get in. Marvell is on the list to get in. I didn't even realize they weren't in the S&P 500. Carvana is on the list to get in. Carvana back at $400 a share. And then in the morning we talked about Reddit, Micro Strategy, Viva Systems, VRT, Liquid Cooling Play for Data Centers, which is up about 3.2% on the day, 18.84. A lot of these names actually are up and maybe they're either previewing an S&P 500 inclusion. Reddit, look at that, up 5% on the day, which could be uh could be the signal or it could be noise if this doesn't actually happen. Viva's flat. And then SoFi after that $1.5 billion dilution down about 6.6%. This one also didn't really recover from the dilution that it had last time.</p>
</detais>

所以我们将看看结果如何，但基本上在下一个小时内我们就会知道。我不认为CoreWeave有资格入选。也许有吧。CoreWeave，他们上市了。不，他们是今年上市的。这会有点困难。他们不是2024年的IPO。他们大概是今年三月份上市的，对吧？是的，我认为他们入选会比较困难。但我们拭目以待，最终结果显然会对其中一些公司产生影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, we're going to see how this ends up playing out, but we will know basically in the next hour. I don't think CoreWeave is eligible to get in. I mean, maybe they are. Coreweave, they went public. No, they went public this year. That's going to be a little tough. They're not a 2024 IPO. They were like March of this year, right? Yeah. I I think that's going to be a little harder for them to get in. Uh but we're going to see and ultimately it will obviously make an impact on some of these companies.</p>
</details>

再说一次，对于SoFi，如果它能入选，对我们所有人来说都将是件很棒的事。问题只是他们是否有机会。Fix是另一个有资格的公司。还有Comfort Systems，这是一家市值340-350亿美元的公司。他们主要专注于暖通空调（HVAC）。今年迄今为止，他们的股价上涨了133%。所以可能会有一些被纳入的公司，很多人并不太了解它们。它们不是人们热议的那些热门股票。但如果它们真的入选，对这些公司的股东来说显然是件好事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, for SoFi, this would be the one for all of us that would be awesome to get in. Just a question of if they have a shot. Fix that's another one that is eligible as well. Comfort Systems, this is a 34 billion $35 billion company. Um HVAC is what they mainly focus on. They're up 133% year to date. So there might be some names that get included that a lot of people just don't know that much about. They're not like sort of the hot names people talk about. But if they do get in, obviously that would be very good for those shareholders in those names.</p>
</details>

### 重磅消息：SpaceX 估值或达8000亿美元

关于埃隆的太空公司有一条大新闻。我本以为这是迟早的事，但看起来它真的要发生了。虽然公司尚未证实，但根据《华尔街日报》的报道，SpaceX正在以8000亿美元的估值进行二级市场股票出售。所以，对于任何在私募市场持有SpaceX的人来说，这是一个大消息。SpaceX是流动性最强的私募市场股票之一。我的意思是，有很多方式可以接触到SpaceX，即使你不是**合格投资者**（Accredited Investor: 指符合特定收入或净资产标准的个人或实体，有资格投资于通常不对公众开放的证券）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that's what you have on S&P. And again, we will find out over the coming hour what ends up happening. Uh big headline on Elon's space company. Thought this was kind of inevitable, but it looks like it is officially happening. not confirmed by the company yet, but as for the Wall Street Journal, secondary share at an $800 billion valuation for SpaceX. So, for anyone who has SpaceX on the private market, SpaceX is one of the most uh liquid private market stocks. I mean, there's a lot of ways to get access to SpaceX, even if you're not an accredited investor.</p>
</details>

你可以在聊天区里说你是否拥有这只股票。我知道本频道的朋友Suchin已经持有很长时间了。我记得他的投资回报率超过了5倍。但SpaceX正在以8000亿美元的估值进行二级市场股票出售，千亿美元级别的估值。这将比OpenAI更有价值，并将正式成为目前最大的私营初创公司。OpenAI目前拥有这个估值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you can put in the chat if you own this one. I know Suchin, who's friend of the channel, has owned this for a long time. I think he's up like more than 5x on it. But SpaceX right there beginning a secondary share at an $800 billion valuation, hundred billion dollar valuation. That would be more valuable than OpenAI and it would officially be the most private the the largest private startup right now. OpenAI currently has that uh that valuation.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为如果SpaceX能获得那样的估值，这对Rocket Lab是利好，对Astra也是利好，很多这类公司都能从中获得一些动力。Rocket Lab，哇，49.40，可能收盘时股价会略低于50美元。距离收盘还有大约9分钟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I think bullish Rocket Lab if SpaceX can get that type of valuation, bullish AS, I mean a lot of those names could get some a little of that momentum. Rocket Lab there. Wow. 49.40 rockab potentially closing just under 50 on the day. Got about 9 minutes until the close.</p>
</details>

标普500指数出现了一根红色蜡烛图，可能会收跌。但很高兴看到太空概念股受到了很多尊重，这对SpaceX来说可能是一件大事。684.70。今天早上它耍了我们。它涨到了68，距离历史最高点只差了70美分，然后就耍了我们。但它未能突破那个水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">S&P I got a red candle. She might end up going red. But it is nice to see that the space names are getting a lot of respect and that could be something very big for SpaceX. 684.70. She tricked us this morning. She got to 68. She got like 70 cents away from alltime highs and she tricked us. But she was not able to get above that level.</p>
</details>

是的，谷歌也拥有SpaceX 8%的股份。所以这对谷歌的持股来说将是一次巨大的增值。讽刺的是，他们的持股在四个季度前曾是谷歌每股收益（EPS）大幅超出预期40%的原因。因为即使他们没有出售股票，他们也在资产负债表上确认了这部分收益。你知道，这可能在未来也会对他们有所帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, Google also owns 8% of SpaceX. So that would be a massive increase on Google on their stake which on ironically their stake I think four quarters ago was the reason why Google massively beat EPS by 40%. Because they actually realized it on their balance sheet even if they didn't sell the stock and you know that could be something that helps them going into the future as well.</p>
</details>

Ares Management Corporation是标普500成分股的另一个候选者。我确实看到这个股票代码被提及。这是一家市值550亿美元的公司。有很多股票代码被认为是符合条件的。他们从事私募信贷业务，有点像KKR和Apollo。我想这两家公司都在标普500指数中。所以是的，Ares Management也有机会入选。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we are going to see what happens there. A that's another candidate for S&P 500 inclusions. I did see this ticker getting thrown out. ARS Management Corporation, $55 billion company. There's a variety of tickers that are floating around as eligible. Um, they are private credit, kind of like a KKR, Apollo. I think both of those are in the S&P 500. So, yes, ARS management, Aries management, they also have a shot of getting in.</p>
</details>

是的，你可以通过私募市场购买。同样，很多时候你只是需要支付一个更高的估值，这会更激进。Hive是我认为很多人使用的平台，H-I-V-E。你需要在那个平台上证明你是合格投资者，但你只是需要支付很多钱。现在，如果它上市了，你的钱翻倍了，你可能不在乎，但相对于人们如何参与这些交易，一些二级平台只是向你收取更高的费用，你知道，这就是他们赚钱的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then and then we're going to see yes, you can buy Android through the private markets. Again, a lot of it is just the valuation you're going to be paying, which is more aggressive. Hive is the platform that I think a lot of people use. H IV, you do have to prove you're an accredited investor on that platform, but you're just going to be paying a lot. Now, if it goes public and you double your money, you might not care, but like relative to how people get into these deals, some of these secondary platforms just charge you a higher fee and you know, that's kind of how they make their money.</p>
</details>

### AI 行业动态：月活用户数据与Meta的新收购

我们来看看这个图表，这是Sensor Tower提供的全球月活跃用户数据，这家公司有一个专有模型来追踪所有这些平台的使用情况。ChatGPT有8.1亿，微软的365 Copilot有2.12亿，Gemini有3.46亿，Perplexity有4500万，Grok有3400万，然后Claude有1100万。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amcore right there, 43.33, that's up 27%. Iran was down about 3.4%. Nebius was also down 4.3. Bitcoin again 89324 and then Ethereum at 320. Take a look at this. This is another chart that has been going around for global monthly active users uh from sensor tower data which is this firm that essentially has a proprietary model that tracks all the usage of these platforms. Chatbt at 810 million 365 copilot for Microsoft 212 million. Gemini 346 million. Perplexity 45 million. Grock 34 million then claude at 11 million.</p>
</details>

现在，其中一些数字与公司自己公布的有所不同。显然，公司的话在这里更重要，他们可能会有更新。另外，还有另一个传言说，ChatGPT 6或5.5，或者随便你怎么称呼它，将在下周发布。所以一个新模型即将问世。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now some of these numbers are a bit different than what the companies themselves have said. Obviously the company's word is a bit more important here and they're going to probably have an update. Also there's another rumor coming out that chachi 6 or 5.5 or whatever you want to call it is coming out next week. So uh a new model is getting ready to come.</p>
</details>

但这些数字的意义在于，越来越多的人正在使用这些产品，这对整个行业的使用率来说非常非常重要。如果我们能得到一个新的GPT模型，我认为那将非常令人兴奋，仅仅因为目前Gemini 3被认为是人们真正关心的最佳模型。显然，除非Altman有一个更好的模型，否则他没有机会，而我们所有作为投资者的人都将关注他们是否能在年底前推出那个更好的模型，那无疑将是他们在年底前竞争的一个好方法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the point of these numbers is that more and more people are using these products which is very, very important for the overall usage of the industry. If we were to get a new GPT model, I think that would be very, very exciting simply because of the fact that, you know, Gemini 3 right now is taking the the cake of like the best model that people actually care about. Um, and obviously Altman has no shot unless he has a better model and all of us as investors are going to see if they can actually put up that better model going into the end of the year and that would definitely be a good way for them to compete going into the end of the year as well.</p>
</details>

今天感觉就像是很多持有**备兑看涨期权**（Covered Calls: 一种期权策略，投资者在持有某支股票的同时，卖出该股票的看涨期权以赚取权利金）的人得救了。比如，如果你有Robin Hood 135的备兑看涨期权，你得救了。如果你有亚马逊232的备兑看涨期权，你得救了。英伟达185，你得救了。BMR因为以太坊价格波动下跌了约5%。但如果你在Rubrik上持有备兑看涨期权，你可能就被坑了。Rubrik一度达到90美元。天啊，看那个，当天上涨了22%，但很多股票收盘时都略低于那些水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amazon right there 229 0.09 09%. You know what this day feels like? It feels like a lot of people that have covered calls that are getting saved. Like if you had Robin Hood 135 covered calls, you're getting saved. If you have Amazon 232 covered calls, you're getting saved. Video 185, you're getting saved. Like BMR right there, that's down about 5% based on ETH price action. But if you had covered calls on some of these names on Rubric, you're probably getting screwed on the cover calls. Rubric hit 90 at one point. Dude, look at that. 22% on the day, but a lot of them finishing just below those levels.</p>
</details>

标普500的公告时间是东部时间下午5:15。我们可能会在5:20得到公告。还有一种可能性，我们可能根本得不到公告。上次在六月份，标普500三年来首次没有进行任何再平衡，我感觉这就像是在 trolling。我当时想，真的吗？三年来，就没有公司需要被剔除出标普指数吗？这太不可思议了。所以也许这次也会发生同样的情况。我认为可能性较小，但如果我们到5:30还没有得到答案，那我们就知道他们可能不进行再平衡了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">S&P announcement is at 5:15 p.m. Eastern. 5:15 p.m. Eastern. Um, we will get that announcement. It might happen at 5:20. Dude, there's there's another probability. We might not get the announcement. last time in June, uh, for the first time in three years, the S&P didn't do any rebalance, which I just felt like was a troll. Uh, I was like, really? In three years, you're not there's no companies that need to get out of the S&P? That's that's quite incredible. Um, so maybe that happens this time. I think it's less likely, but if we don't get an answer by like 5:30, then we know that maybe they're not doing a rebalance.</p>
</details>

我的SoFi备兑看涨期权完蛋了。是的，SoFi这次稀释确实帮了大家一个大忙。如果你持有28.50、28、29的期权。当然，如果他们入选了，也许……我的意思是，还有四分钟收盘，我不知道你是否能平仓。但问题是，假设你有一个28美元的备兑看涨期权，然后在盘后，SoFi因为某种原因，比如被纳入标普500，股价飙升到29美元，那些股票很可能会被行权。我们已经见过很多次这种情况了。所以，为了可能保住你的股票，放弃几百美元并不是最坏的主意，但这完全取决于他们是否能入选。我们稍后会看到结果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My SoFi covered calls were cooked. Yeah, SoFi definitely did everybody a solid with that dilution. If you had 28.50, 28, 29. Now granted, if they get in maybe I mean there's four minutes left. I don't know if you can close them, but see the thing is if let's say you have a 28 covered call and then after hours SoFi shoots up to 29 for whatever reason, maybe because they got into the S&P 500, those shares probably get called away. We've seen this happen many, many times. So, I mean, giving back a couple hundred bucks just to potentially save your shares if they were to get in is not the worst idea, but it all depends on them getting in. And we're going to see later if that ends up taking place.</p>
</details>

Noto在45美元时将获得5亿美元的报酬。我们必须想象他是有计划的，对吧？他不是那种不知道自己在做什么的随机CEO。而且他们也不是像绝望的meme股那样需要钱。所以我认为这背后有更深层的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My Soapi leaps are also gone. Dude, Nod is going to get paid half a billion at 45. We've got to imagine that uh that he's he's got a plan, right? Like he's not some random CEO that has no idea um what he's doing. And it's not like they need the money. So like like like a like a desperate meme stock. So I think there's something deeper. I think there's something deeper.</p>
</details>

Meta今天表现不错，673美元。两周前这只股票还在585美元，周一还在620美元。所以任何大规模利用Meta下跌机会的人都得到了丰厚的回报。这是2026年值得看多的候选股，我认为还有亚马逊和英伟达。Meta股价今年迄今上涨了12%。上周还是3%，现在已经到了12%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Matt has had a great day. 673. I mean, this stock was at 585 two weeks ago and it was at 620 on Monday. So, anyone who's really taking advantage of the metadip at scale, you've been heavily rewarded and that is a long candidate going into 2026 along with I think Amazon and Nvidia. Meta stock year to date now 12%. It was 3% last week, so now we're at 12%.</p>
</details>

他们应该在周三而不是周五进行标普再平衡，因为期权市场的原因。是的，他们宣布的方式一直很奇怪，而且他们宣布的方式非常陈旧。就像每个人都在刷新一个网站，毫无理由。这应该是一个非常现代化的过程，但事实并非如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They should do these S&P rebounces on Wednesdays and not Fridays because the options market. Yeah, I mean it's always been weird kind of how they announced them and also they just have such an archaic way of announcing it. Like everyone's refreshing a website for no like this should be such such a modern process and it's not.</p>
</details>

市场现已收盘。我们本周的交易结束了。这是漫长的一周，但也是短暂的一周。感觉很长，但过得也异常快。我们来到了十二月的第一个周末。标普500指数收于685.66，盘后略有上涨至685.87。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But unfortunately that's how you're seeing it. Grab also down on the day again for Grab. I think the number one thing to remember is that until they get clarity on what's going on with goto I think this stock is going to continue to be red. So 519 I think is deeply deeply undervalued. I don't think it makes much sense for the company but nonetheless they have a narrative attached to them right now. In a couple weeks that narrative potentially changes and so until it does you know you're likely going to have investors keeping it at those levels and we have to see how it ultimately ends up playing out. S&P 500 right there at 685 Friday December 5th 4 p.m. Thank you everybody for being here. We will know in about an hour who gets included into the S&P 500. The market is now closed. All right, we are closed for the week. We are closed for the week and we are done. It's been a long week, but a quick week. It's a long week. I mean, but it's been a quick week as well. felt long but it also went by incredibly quick and we are here at the end of the first week of December. S&P 500 685.66 on the day 18% up a little bit after hours 685.87</p>

### 深度分析：Netflix 收购华纳兄弟的监管风暴

这里有一条新闻。美国司法部（DOJ）预计将调查Netflix对华纳兄弟的收购要约，监管机构已经在审查该交易可能如何巩固Netflix的主导地位。哇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, that's a headline. DOJ expected to investigate Netflix's bid for Warner Brothers with regulators already examining how the deal could cement Netflix dominance. Wow.</p>
</details>

这对于Netflix来说，持续成为一个问题，真是令人难以置信。我们来听听关于Netflix的一些报道，然后再看其他一些新闻。Josh Brown，就是今天卖掉谷歌买入Netflix的那个人，已经减持了85%的Netflix仓位，并表示要观察这笔交易如何演变成一个政治皮球并占用资本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, that is quite incredible that this continues to become a thing for Netflix. Let's get some coverage on Netflix and we'll get through a bunch of other headlines that we have. But Josh Brown, the person who sold Google to buy Netflix today, has trimmed 85% of his Netflix and watch this become a political football and tie up capital.</p>
</details>

> Josh Brown：这只是一个投资组合管理的决定。我认为会有其他机会，在Netflix这件事在华盛顿的“绞肉机”里慢慢解决的过程中，提供更多的短期上行空间。我希望大家明白，我认为Netflix现在代表着巨大的价值，但我不认为这只股票能够摆脱自身的困境。这里要记住的是，我们不知道是否会有更高的出价。我们不知道共和党人会就此发表什么看法。我们不知道民主党人会怎么说。两党内部都有一个庞大的反垄断阵营，原因各不相同。当然还有白宫。这将是后疫情时期全球第二大并购案，仅次于Norfolk Southern和Union Pacific的铁路合并案，价值850亿美元。你不能告诉我，“索伦之眼”不会看到这件事发生，然后说这对我们意味着什么？而且请记住，这是媒体行业，所以它可能意味着一些事情。我不是说他们必须让《学徒》复播，或者会是那样的事情。但如果这需要超过一年的时间，不要感到惊讶。这可能需要超过一年。所以我认为Netflix价值很高，这笔交易也很棒。我实际上很喜欢这笔交易，不仅对他们有利，而且我喜欢他们能阻止这笔资产落入他人之手。在流媒体战争中，这一点同样重要。但我不能坐在这里。所以我保留了一个非常小的头寸，我们将看看会发生什么。我们将在接下来的12到18个月里观察情况如何发展。

<p class="english-text">So, it's just a um it's just a a portfolio management decision. Um I think there going to be other opportunities that have more near-term upside while this Netflix thing works its way through the uh the meat grinder in Washington. I want I want everyone to understand I think Netflix right now represents a tremendous value, but I don't think the stock will be able to get out of its own way. The thing to keep in mind here is we don't know if an over-the-top bid comes. We don't know what Republicans are going to want to talk about as as it pertains to this. We don't know what the Democrats will want to talk about. There's a lot of antitrust uh there's a big antitrust contingent in both parties for different reasons. Then of course there's the White House. This would be the second largest merger or acquisition in the post-pandemic period worldwide other than Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific. the railroad tie up at 85 billion. You cannot tell me um the eye of Sauron is not going to see this thing happening and say what can we what what does this mean for us? And keep in mind this is media so it probably means something. I'm not telling you they have to put the apprentice back on the air or it's going to be something like that. But don't be surprised that this takes over a year produced by Baron. This this could take over a year. So look I celebrity I have tons of gonna be the remedy. Yeah, >> right. I have tons of Right. Ma Ma Maga Apprentice. So, all all I'm saying is I think Netflix is a great value. I think it's a great deal. I actually love the deal for them. Not only for them, but I love that they're keeping this out of the hands of somebody else. Equally important in the streaming wars. Um, but I can't sit here. So, I I kept a very small position on and we'll we'll see what happens. We'll I we'll watch it for the next 12 to 18 months. See how this goes.</p>
</details>

> 主持人：今天华尔街的一些分析报告谈到了这笔交易的战略性质，以及它如何偏离了Netflix历史上的做法。Huber Research表示：“在过去10年的大部分时间里，我们都给予了增持评级，但现在我们选择观望。Netflix在过去15年多里通过开发自己的内容取得了巨大成功，并明智地避免了进行大规模交易。我们认为没有必要改变这一点。” Baird今天也发表评论：“这无疑偏离了公司历史上的做法，我们理解投资者最初对这笔交易规模以及潜在的交割整合过程的犹豫，但我们怀疑长期利益最终将超过短期风险。” 作为股东，你必须愿意长期持有，必须有更宏大的愿景。但这种观点认为，这与Netflix习惯的做法在历史上是不同的，就像如果苹果公司进行一次比以往任何时候都规模更大的收购，你可能会听到类似的评论。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> I thought some of the Kev, you have the stock, too. I thought some of the notes from the street today about the strategic nature of the the deal and how it's a departure for Netflix from how it has historically done things. Uh Huber Research says, "We've had an overweight for nearly the entire time over the last 10 years, but are stepping aside. Netflix has been very successful the last 15 plus years developing its own content and has smartly stayed away from doing sizable deals. We do not see the need to change that." Baird weighs in today. Certainly a deviation from the company's historical approach and we understand the initial investor hesitation regarding the size of this deal and the potential closing integration process, but we suspect the long-term benefits will ultimately outweigh the near-term risks risks. You as a shareholder have to be willing to sit for the long haul. You have to have a bigger vision. But the notion that this is historically different than what Netflix is used to doing, not unlike you might hear if Apple was to make an acquisition of some scale larger than it's ever done before, you'd probably have similar notes.</p>
</details>

> 嘉宾：我希望我们能从苹果看到这一点，Scott，而且我很高兴从Netflix看到这一点。我持相反观点。我认为看到他们采取攻势是非常棒的。这是一次**IP**（Intellectual Property: 知识产权，指对创造性劳动的成果所享有的专有权利，如专利、版权和商标等，在媒体行业常指热门影视作品等内容资产）的博弈，如果交易能够通过——我同意所有分析报告和Josh的评论，可能性相当小。我也认为我们会看到来自Paramount Skyworks的竞争性报价，或者说敌意收购，来维持这笔交易的活力。但如果真的发生了，你可以把它想象成像迪士尼收购星球大战和漫威那样。当你谈论像《权力的游戏》、《黑道家族》、DC宇宙、《哈利·波特》这些系列时，Netflix能用这些做什么……我认为这对这家公司来说是一个绝佳的机会，可以将这些系列带到一个全新的高度。所以我对这笔交易感到兴奋，我很高兴。

<p class="english-text">>> I hope we do see that from Apple, Scott, and I'm thrilled to see it from Netflix. I'm going to take the other side of this. I think it's incredibly um wonderful to see them go on the offensive. this is a an IP play that if the deal were to go through and I agree with all the notes and Josh's comments that the likelihood is pretty thin. I also think that we'll see a competitive bid from Paramount Skyworks to excuse me a hostile bid from them to to to to keep this deal alive. But if it did happen, you kind of think of it like the Disney deal when they bought Star Wars and when they bought Marvel. When you're talking about some of these franchises, Game of Thrones, The Sopranos, the DC Universe, Harry Potter, what Netflix can do with this >> I never saw it. I think it's an amazing um opportunity for this company to to just take these franchises into a whole another stratosphere. So, I'm excited about the deal and I'm I'm happy.</p>

<p class="english-text">What do you make of Josh's move to sell 85% of his his stock?</p>
</details>

> 嘉宾：我认为这是个错误。我更倾向于买入这只股票。如果交易告吹，股价会更高。另外，我和Josh之间的一个区别是，我可以针对这只股票卖出备兑看涨期权。现在这只股票的波动性会加剧，尤其是在他们如此大规模退出的情况下。我敢肯定，在基本面上，他会同意你所说的一切。是的，股票本身，公司本身，领导层，他都喜欢。但你将会处于某种……

<p class="english-text">>> I think it's a mistake. I think I would be more of a buyer of the stock. If the deal does get blown up, the stock will go higher. And plus, the one difference between Josh and I is I can write covered calls against this. There's going to be heightened volatility now around this name even more so they were bowing out in in such a large way. He would agree with everything that you've said, I'm sure, on the fundamental basis of this. Yeah. um the stock itself he obviously the company itself the leadership likes all of it but you're gonna be in some level as in in</p>
</details>

> 嘉宾：我不会减持85%。我认为那太多了。如果这是一个投资组合管理的举动，那另当别论。但那可是很大一部分Netflix仓位，你为了一个看起来增值远大于减值的事情而退出，即使在华盛顿能否完成交易存在一些争议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I wouldn't trim 85% of it I think that's I mean if it's a portfolio management move that's different but like I don't know that's a lot of Netflix position you're getting out of for something that seems to be much more accretive than not even if there's going to be some controversy around if they can get the deal done in Washington</p>
</details>

据报道，派拉蒙（Paramount）正考虑直接向股东提出对华纳兄弟的收购要约。这种事情是可能发生的。公司可以直接接触股东，说：“嘿，我们愿意为华纳兄弟支付950亿美元，而不是Netflix的800亿。”然后他们就可以绕过公司管理层。接着，公司就有了信托责任。现代历史上谁这么做过？埃隆·马斯克先生，当他提出对X的收购要约时，他公开表示想收购，然后CEO就有了信托责任去询问这个要约，因为如果那个要约比现有的要约更好，作为受托人你不能忽视它，你必须去审视。

<details>

<p class="english-text">apparently Paramount is reportedly considering presenting an offer for Warner Brothers directly to shareholders now this stuff can happen. Uh companies can go directly to the shareholder base and just say hey we are willing to pay 95 billion for uh Warner Brothers instead of uh Netflix's 80 billion and you know they can just bypass the company and then the company then has a fiduciary you know who did this in modern history Mr. Elon Musk when he put out his offer for X um he publicly said I want to buy and then the the CEO had a fiduciary responsibility to then inquire about the offer because if that offer is better than an existing offer you can't ignore it as a fiduciary you have to take a look at it.</p>
</details>

所以，如果派拉蒙那么想要，他们直接发布新闻稿说愿意支付1000亿美元或某个疯狂的数字，那将是相当疯狂的，然后华纳兄弟就不能直接拒绝了。华纳兄弟股价当天上涨了约7%，达到26.08美元。所以我们将拭目以待。

<p class="english-text">So that is kind of crazy if Paramount wants it that bad that they're just going to put out a press release and says we'll pay a hundred billion or something crazy and then Warner Brothers can't actually just dismiss it. Warren Brothers 26.08 up about 7% on the day. And so we're going to see we're going to see how that one ends up playing out.</p>

### 专家视角：解读当前经济与市场情绪

> 教授：实际上，我对假日销售的情况相当满意。我之前有点担心关税可能会影响销售，但黑色星期五表现不错，网络星期一也相当不错。虽然不是特别火爆，但这显示出经济正以大约2%到2.5%的GDP增速在运行。有一件事非常不寻常，Scott，昨天我看到初请失业金人数降至三年多来的最低点，而前一天周三，ADP就业报告显示了近三年来的最低水平。我的意思是，这是绝对不应该发生的事情。劳动力市场真的很难解读。这是我们见过的最极端的“不增员也不裁员”的经济。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm actually fairly pleased with what I'm seeing in terms of holiday sales. Uh I was a little fearful that tariffs might impact those sales, but Black Friday was good. Cyber Monday was fairly good. Not gang busters, but it shows an economy that, you know, is is moving at a, you know, probably two two and a half% GDP pace. Um, one thing that's so unusual, Scott, I mean, yesterday when I saw jobless claims go to more than a three-year low, uh, and and the day before that on Wednesday, seeing the ADP employment report showing the lowest level in almost three years. I mean, that is something that is just never supposed to happen. Uh, I mean, the the the labor market uh is is so hard to interpret. This is the most extreme uh no higher no fire economy uh that we've ever seen.</p>
</details>

> 主持人：有趣的是，教授，今天有些分析报告确实谈到季节性因素对我们有利，这通常是如此，尤其是当你带着如此强劲的一年进入十二月时。但今天也提到了**FOMO**（Fear Of Missing Out: 错失恐惧症，指担心错过别人正在经历的有益体验而产生的焦虑感，在投资中常指追涨行为），它再次全面爆发。有很多投资组合经理表现不及市场，也许他们无法像他们希望的那样在一些大型科技股上投入那么多资金。所以现在追逐开始了。这有什么道理吗？

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> It's funny, professor, you know, there are some notes today that do talk about seasonality being in in our favor um as it as it tends to be, especially when you come into December with such a strong year leading into it. But there's also a mention today of FOMO that it's in full swing yet again. That there are a lot of portfolio managers who have underperformed this market. maybe they couldn't be as large as they otherwise would have wanted to in some of the mega caps. So now the chase is on. Is there something to that?</p>
</details>

> 教授：嗯，确实有，但同样，你知道，“七巨头”一直是表现优异的股票，而它们在过去四到六周实际上相对疲软，这有点令人惊讶。现在，也许有些人会说，我必须在年底的最后几周把它们纳入我的资产负债表。确实会有一些这样的补仓行为发生。但我实际上更高兴看到涨势扩大。现在我看到的FOMO情绪比我四到六周前看到的要少。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, there there is, but again, you know, the Mag 7 has been the outperformers and they've been relatively weak actually over the last uh four to six weeks, which is a little bit surprising. Now, maybe some people will say, I got to get them on my balance sheet in the last couple of weeks of the year. You do get some uh of that evening up that's happening. Um, but I'm actually rather pleased to seeing uh the rally broaden out. Uh, and right now I I actually see less FOMO than I think I uh saw maybe four or six weeks ago.</p>
</details>

> 主持人：哦，有意思。另一个观点是花旗集团今天提出的，教授，他们说“没有痛苦，就没有收获”（no pain, no gain），并用大写的A和I来强调AI，谈论泡沫。他们说：“我们认为美国股市正处于泡沫之中。但泡沫初期是相当有利可图的，所以继续做多。” 这就像，好吧，我猜你得先把它吹大才能戳破它，所以我们不妨尽可能地乘着这波浪潮。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Oh, interesting. You know, the the other idea is is what city puts forth today, professor, where they say no pain, no gain, and they use the A and the I in pain and gain in in caps and talking about a bubble. We we think we're in a bubble in US equities, they say. But bubbles are initially quite profitable, so stay long. This is like, well, I guess you have to inflate it before you pop it, so we might as well ride this as long as we can.</p>
</details>

> 教授：你知道，这和96年或99年有很大的不同。顺便说一句，那时的互联网泡沫比我们现在看到的要大很多倍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> You know, the big So, just a minute. Is this like 96 or 99? There's a big There's a big difference uh about that. And by the way, that internet bubble was many times what we're seeing now.</p>
</details>

> 主持人：ServiceNow批准了五比一的股票分割。ServiceNow将分割其股票，目前股价为859美元。盘后股价略有上涨，约0.5%。如果价格保持不变，两周后分割生效时将以171美元开盘。股东投票已经通过。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Service Now approves five for one stock split. Service Now will be splitting their stock, $859 stock. stocks up a little bit after hours about half a percent. Uh if it stays at this price, it'll open at $171. I believe in two weeks the split will be approved. Uh honestly, it might happen closer earlier than that, but officially the shareholder vote has gone through. Service Now shareholders have approved a five for one stock split.</p>
</details>

> 教授：我很高兴看到“七巨头”最近表现出一些谨慎。我不是说，你知道，像特斯拉、Palantir，它们中有少数确实有三位数的市盈率，但其他的，市盈率在30左右，而年增长率超过20%，并且在所有指标上都超出预期。我不是说它们是必买的股票，但我肯定不会说它们处于泡沫区域。一旦你剔除“七巨头”或相关的科技股，你会得到低于20的市盈率，这在我的 playbook 里绝对不是泡沫。所以我不同意花旗集团的分析。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Uh uh you know, not in in both the tech stocks and the non- tech stocks. I'm actually pleased to see some caution in the mag 7 uh recently and uh I'm not saying you know I mean Tesla Palunteer there's a few of them that do have those tripledigit PE ratios but the others uh you know PE ratios of of 30 when you're growing 20% plus a year and beating on all metrics. I'm not saying they're the ones to own, but certainly I wouldn't say that they are in bubble territory. And once you subtract the mag 7 or the related tech, you get pees that are under 20, which in my uh you know, playbook is absolutely not a bubble. So I I am not in agreement with uh you know, Cityroup's analysis here.</p>
</details>

> 主持人：当你谈到某些类型的股票，你提到了Palantir。我想知道，鉴于你多年来看过这么多市场，你见过很多像这只股票一样表现的股票。作为教授，你如何告诉投资者如何判断这样一家公司？它是一个完全合法、真实、伟大的企业，对吧？有一个火爆的CEO，他从不……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know, when you when you talk about certain kinds of stocks and and you mentioned Palunteer by name. I'm wondering given the number of markets you've seen over the years, you've seen many stocks that have acted like this one over the years. How do you tell an investor class, so to speak, as the professor, how to judge a company like that? It's a totally legit, real, great business, right? with a with a fire brand CEO who doesn't take any you know what</p>
</details>

> 教授：你现在说的所有话都可以用来形容特斯拉，对吧？一个备受瞩目的CEO，他做出了惊人的事情，市盈率远超100。我们知道，如果特斯拉只是一家汽车公司，它的股价大概会在30或40美元。这一切都取决于埃隆·马斯克能做什么、可能做什么的期权价值。当然，这是一个价值64美元的问题。所有Karp能做、可能做的事情。但这两家公司，Palantir和特斯拉，都比2000年时被疯狂购买的那些互联网公司显示出更多的实质内容。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and and this company's got some real stuff going on. Yes, it trades at a high P, but it also has a a very loyal cohort of investors behind it, not only institutionally but retail. Well, Scott, everything you're saying right now could be said of Tesla, right? Um I mean you know a very you know CEO that's in the limelight uh who's done amazing things PE ratio well over a hundred. We know if it is just on the if Tesla was just a car company you know it would be selling at about 30 or $40 a share. It's all those options on what Elon Musk can do might do. Uh of course that's a $64 question. uh all the things that Karp can do, might do. Uh but these both of these companies, Palunteer a and and Tesla show so much more substance than the crazy internet companies that were being bought in 2000.</p>
</details>

> 主持人：我猜这正是我的观点，对吧？就是你必须做出区分。即使我们把不同时期与市值、估值等进行类比，也存在需要指出的明显差异。我问你这个，利率的回升会让你担心吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I guess that's that's kind of my point, right? is you have to make a distinction. Even while we make analogies to different periods of time and market caps and valuations etc. there are clear differences that that need to be pointed out. Let me ask you this. Um the backup in interest rates concerning to you in any way?</p>
</details>

> 教授：是的。我们下周将看到美联储的会议。我一直说，即使美联储降息，我实际上认为十年期国债收益率会在4%到4.25%之间。我认为你必须降低短期利率，因为短期利率通常比长期利率低一个百分点，这就是为什么它应该在3%左右。我们将看看债券市场的反应。今天造成这种回升的原因是什么？很难说。他们是担心Kevin Hassett吗？他可能会对特朗普有点过于顺从，降息太快、太多。也可能有一点是，石油市场有所上涨。我不会说4.11%是需要担心的事情，当然还远未到那个地步。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Uh yeah. Well, you know, we're going to see the Fed uh next week. Um, you know, I've always said that even if the Fed lowers, I don't I actually see the the tenure between four and four and a quarter. Uh, I mean, I think I think you have to lower the short end because the short end is usually one percentage point below the long end and that's why it belows belongs on the low 3s. We'll see how the bond market reacts. What's causing some of this backup today? It's it's it's it's hard to say. Are are they worried about Kevin Hasset? That he might, you know, cowtow to Trump a little bit too much, lower interest rates a little too fast, a little too much. It could be a little bit of uh, you know, the the oil market has ticked up a bit. Uh, I wouldn't call, you know, 411 to be something to be concerned about. Uh, certainly quite yet.</p>
</details>

> 主持人：既然你提到了美联储，那我问你这个。我认为人们认为他们下周会降息。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> I'll ask you this then about the Feds since you bring it up. I I think people think they're going to cut next week.</p>
</details>

> 教授：是的，我认为这将会是一次非常鹰派的降息，这意味着他们会降息，但会在声明中加入他们倾向于在1月份保持利率不变的措辞，除非他们看到经济显著恶化或通胀急剧下降。所以，我认为这就是下周要传达的信息。

I I think it's going to be a very hawkish cut, which means they're going to cut, but put in the language that they're apt to hold in January unless they see the economy, you know, significantly deteriorate or inflation come down dramatically. So that that is what I think the the message is going to be next week.</p>

</details>

> Steve：我们来谈谈Netflix。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> let's talk about Netflix a minute.</p>
</details>

> Amit：首先，我想说的是，大概一年前，Steve，当这只股票可能在12美元时，你说：“我们必须关注华纳兄弟。” 你的论点是他们可能会被收购，但你也说：“天啊，他们有惊人的资产。” 我当时担心的是债务问题。这只股票今年迄今上涨了160%。显然，没人关心债务。他们关心的是你最初论点中提到的——惊人的资产，看起来这为他们赢得了一份收购要约。所以，我想把舞台交给你，你认为这对Netflix和华纳兄弟来说是正确的举动吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> First of all, I just want to say that I think a year ago, Steve, this was probably at $12, was saying, "We have to look at Warner Brothers." And his thesis would not well, your thesis was they could get bought up, but you also just said, "Dude, they have amazing assets." I was concerned about the debt. Uh the stock's up 160% year-to- date. Apparently, no one cares about the debt. They care about what you mentioned in your original thesis, which was the Amazing Assets, and it looks like that has got them a buyout offer. So, I guess I'll give you the floor, but do you think this is the right move for Netflix and the right move for Warner Brothers if they acquire them?</p>
</details>

> Steve：事情是这样的。公平地说，我是股东，因为我从AT&T的分拆中获得了我的股份。我没有买入比我应该买的更多。我认为这是一个阴谋论。你准备好听阴谋论了吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, here's the breakdown. And to be fair, I am a shareholder because I have my shares from the spin-off from AT&T. I did not buy more than I should have. I think that this is I'm going to throw a conspiracy. You ready for con conspiracy corner?</p>
</details>

> Amit：好的，我们来听听。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Okay, let's do it.</p>
</details>

> Steve：Netflix拿不到这个标的。监管机构不会让它通过。它会落到派拉蒙手里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Netflix ain't getting the bid. >> Okay, what's your >> The regulators aren't going to let it go through. It's going to go to Paramount. It's going to go to Paramont.</p>
</details>

> Amit：好的，但为什么？为什么监管机构会……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Okay, but why? This is Why wouldn't the regulators like</p>
</details>

> Steve：他们不会让排名第一和第四的流媒体公司合并，让排名第一的变得更大。派拉蒙大概排在第六或第七。所以那样的合并绝对行得通。我认为那样你就可以认为这是一个合法的垄断，而这笔交易将很难通过。我认为拉里·埃里森会用尽他所有的手段，和特朗普一起，捐赠他需要做的一切，让监管机构不批准这笔交易，然后让派拉蒙直接接触股东，并可能提高他们的报价，支付与Netflix合同中58.8亿美元的全部解约费，然后说：“听着，你们永远无法通过监管机构。他们永远不会批准。接受我们的交易。我们会支付你们解约金的额外费用。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Go ahead. Why? They're not going to let the number one and number four streamer merch and let the number one streamer get bigger. Paramount's like six or seven. So, it would absolutely work. I think that then you can consider this a legit monopoly and this is going to have a very hard time getting through. I think Larry Ellison is gonna use every trick in the book he's got with Trump donate whatever he has to do to get the freaking regulators to not approve this and have Paramount go directly to the shareholders and potentially up their bid and pay the entire breakup fee of 5.8 8 billion that's in the contract with Netflix and say, "Listen, this is what you're never going to get this past the regulators. They're never going to approve it. Take our deal. We will pay you the additional money from the breakup thing."</p>
</details>

> Steve：原因如下。这是一生一次的交易。这些资产再也不会上市了。埃里森和他的儿子们整个周末都会和他们的银行家一起工作。他们会想出办法的。他们不会不战而降。尽管这看起来似乎远未结束，或者说已经尘埃落定。但这远未结束，因为在Netflix这边，通过监管机构至少需要一年半的时间。派拉蒙那边，他们可以更快地推动这件事。我确实认为，在这种情况下，我们还没有听到最终的细节。而且既然这是一生一次的事情，也许埃里森家族愿意在短期内多付一些钱，因为如果他们做不成这件事，他们就完蛋了。派拉蒙就完蛋了，而Netflix将成为一个你再也无法撼动的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Wow. >> And here's why. This is a once in a-lifetime deal. These assets are never coming up for grabs again. Ellison and his sons are going to be working the whole weekend with their bankers. They're going to figure something out. They're not going down without a fight. This is even though this seems like it's far from over or it's a done deal. It's far from over because this is going to take at least a year and a half to get through the regulators on the Netflix side. Paramount side, they can get this pushed through a lot quicker and I do think that this is a situation where we have not heard the final details yet. And since it's a once in a-lifetime thing, maybe the Ellison's want to overpay in the short term because if they don't get this done, they're screwed. Paramount is screwed and Netflix becomes a company you can't mess with anymore.</p>
</details>

> Steve：现在，从Netflix的角度来看，这是一笔了不起的交易。他们出高价，而且他们应该出高价，这对任何人来说都是一笔了不起的交易。正如我一直说的，苹果应该买下他们，Netflix应该买下他们，亚马逊也应该买下他们。华纳兄弟拥有皇冠上的明珠般的资产。对Netflix来说，他们不仅获得了华纳兄弟工作室和整个内容库，还获得了HBO和HBO Max以及所有内容。而且他们现在可以通过华纳兄弟制作他们所有的电视节目和电影。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, from Netflix, it's a it's an amazing deal. They're paying up and they should pay up and it would be an amazing deal for anybody. As I've been saying, Apple should have bought them. Netflix should have bought them. Amazon should have bought them. Warner Brothers has the crown jewel assets. And for Netflix, they not only gain Warner Brothers Studios and the entire content library, they gain HBO and HBO Max and all the content. And they can now produce all their TV shows and their movies through Warner Brothers.</p>
</details>

> Amit：你在这里提出了几个非常好的观点。第一点是，这些资产再也不会出售了。我认为这是一个非常重要的观点，因为像哈利波特这样的系列不是经常被转手的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think you made a couple really good points here. The number one point that these are assets that will never be up for sale again. Um, by the way guys, Steve's YouTube right there, so please make sure to subscribe to him as well. I think that's a hell of a point because I mean there's not many times the Harry Potter franchise gets just passed around. So</p>
</details>

> Amit：是的，你说得对，这是一笔大交易，《权力的游戏》，所有这些东西。我想问你的是，你说他们会被视为垄断，但如果Netflix的论点是“我们与YouTube竞争，所以我们不能被认真对待，因为注意力经济如此广阔，你不能说我们是垄断”呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> yeah, you are right that this this is a big deal, Game of Thrones, all that stuff. The question I would have to you is you're saying they're going to be viewed as monopoly, but what if Netflix's argument is uh we compete with YouTube, so we can't seriously we like the attention economy is so wide you can't say we're a monopoly.</p>
</details>

> Steve：我认为他们会这么说，而且我认为这是他们整个论点的一部分，即这不仅仅是CBS对派拉蒙对迪士尼。这是一个注意力环境，有YouTube和Prime以及所有这些其他东西，关键是观看时间而不是订阅数。但我认为对此的反驳是，这仍然是流媒体电视和流媒体电影，而Netflix已经是主导者。当你加上订阅数，我的意思是，HBO Max有多少用户，3300万还是多少？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, and I think that is what they're going to say and I think that that is part of their whole thing that this is not just CBS versus Paramont versus Disney. This is an intention and an environment with YouTube and Prime and all these other things and it's watchtime not subscriptions. But I think the counter to that really is this is still streaming TV and streaming movies and Netflix is already the dominant factor. And when you add the subscriptions, I mean, HBO Max has what, 33 million people or something like that.</p>
</details>

> Amit：不，实际上，我今天看到HBO Max有1.3亿订阅用户。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> No, actually, dude, I saw today HBO Max has 130 million subscribers.</p>
</details>

> Steve：1.3亿订阅用户。当你把这个加到Netflix平台上，他们就成了一个超级垄断者，他们成为了一个更大的第一名。这不是第二名和第三名竞争与第一名抗衡。这是第一名吞并第四名，让差距变得更大。我认为这将是监管机构非常难以接受的事情。而且我确实认为派拉蒙会试图提出更高的报价，想出一些办法，并试图直接接触股东和董事会，说：“听着，和我们合作，心照不宣，交易会通过的。特朗普已经祝福了。我们会提高报价。我们会给你58亿的解约费，这是Netflix合同里的，我们会以某种方式提高它。”他们会想办法在这件事上坑Netflix。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> 130 million subscribers. When you add that into the Netflix platform, they become a uber monopoly and they become a much more larger number one. This isn't number two and number three competing to go headto-head with number one. This is number one taking out number four to to make the gap even wider. And I think that that's going to be something that regulators are gonna have a very hard time with. And I do think Paramont's going to try to come over the top and figure something out and try to go directly to the shareholders in the board and say, "Listen, with us, wink wink, nod nod, it's going to go through. The Donald's already blessed it. We're going to up the deal. We'll we'll give you the 5.8 a breakup fee that is going to be in Netflix's thing will up it somehow. They're going to try to figure out a way to snake Netflix on this.</p>
</details>

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> You think they work a different story? >> You think they paid six billion just to get >> feed? Yes.</p>
</details>

> Amit：好的。那么接下来的问题是，为什么拉里·埃里森，作为甲骨文的CEO，一个比媒体行业任何机会都好得多的机会，为什么他这么关心这件事？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Okay. So then here's the follow-up question. Why does Larry Ellison, who's the CEO of Oracle, which is a way better opportunity than whatever is in media, why does he care so much about this?</p>
</details>

> Steve：因为他的儿子们在经营派拉蒙。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Because his sons are running Paramot.</p>
</details>

> Amit：是的。但就像……所以他只是想让他的儿子非常成功？这就是支付400亿美元的动机吗？你知道我的意思吗？这只是……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. But like does so he just wants his son to like be really successful? Is that the motivation here to pay 40 billion dollars? Like you know what I'm saying? It's just it's</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I'm just making it clear.</p>
</details>

> Amit：是的。好的。嗯，是的。你为什么认为他那么关心派拉蒙和他们的成功？我猜……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Okay. Um Yeah. Why do you think he like why do you think that he cares so much about Paramount and their success? I guess</p>
</details>

> Steve：你知道我不知道，可能因为他只是在资助他的儿子们，他认为这是未来，传统媒体将继续崩溃。我的意思是，看，Netflix的交易对华纳兄弟的股东来说是一笔非常好的交易。当你审视整个交易时，你得到24.5美元的现金，另外几美元的股权，以及在一个分拆公司中剩下的传统电视频道。这是一笔非常好的交易。好的，分拆公司将被加载大量债务。不是所有债务都会最终落到Netflix的资产负债表上。这是一笔非常好的交易，但我认为与派拉蒙有更好的交易可以达成。我真的这么认为。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> you know I don't know probably because he's just bankrolling his sons and he thinks that this is the future and that legacy media is going to continue to crumble. I mean look the Netflix deal is a really good deal for Warner Brothers shareholders. When you look at the entire deal, you're getting 24 24 and a half in the cash. You're getting another couple of bucks on equity and you're getting the remaining legacy TV channels in a Spinco company. It's a really good deal. Okay, the Spinco company will be loaded up with a considerable amount of debt. Not all the debt will end up on Netflix's balance sheet. It's a really good deal, but I think there's a better deal to be had with Paramont. I really do.</p>
</details>

<p class="english-text">>> I mean, >> you don't think that Larry Ellison went to Trump is like, "Listen, I get a hold of these guys, CNN's becoming Fox 2.0." You think he didn't say that to I would say that to Trump.</p>
</details>

> Amit：当然，他们不是在购买电视网络，对吧？那是分拆成一家上市公司。但谁能说他们不会把那部分剥离出来，不让它进入分拆公司呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Now, granted, they're not buying the the stream the the TV networks though, right? Or that that's a spin-off into a public company. But who's to say that they don't just [ __ ] carve that out into that doesn't make it into the spin cup?</p>
</details>

> Steve：是的。我的意思是，根据我今天早上读到的交易信息，他们将把Discovery Global Plus变成一家上市公司，包括所有流媒体和电视业务，而Netflix将收购工作室。但就你所说，今天早上也有报道，与你说的相符。CNBC说特朗普对奥巴马的制作公司与Netflix有合作关系感到不快。然后你还有所有围绕Netflix的所谓“觉醒”争议。所以可能会有一个广泛的论点，即政府不希望这家公司变得超级强大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. I mean, from what I read on the deal this morning, they're they're going to Discovery Global Plus will turn into a public company that'll include all the streaming or the the TV stuff and Netflix will acquire the studios. But to your point, and this was reported in the morning as well, it's consistent with what you're saying. You know, CNBC said that Trump is not happy that Obama uh production company uh has a relationship with Netflix. And you know, then you've got all the sort of woke controversy around Netflix. So like there could be a broad argument that the administration doesn't want to make this company uber powerful</p>
</details>

> Steve：并且让他们创作显然不站在他们一边……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and have them create content that is obviously not on the side of having</p>
</details>

> Steve：而且请记住，那是Netflix的交易，不是派拉蒙的交易。所以Netflix是那个把所有东西都分拆成一个拥有传统媒体的分拆公司。埃里森很可能会去找特朗普说：“嘿，别担心。我们会保留CNN作为我们的一部分。”我们会处理好CNN的。别担心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and keep in mind that's the deal from Netflix. That's not the deal from Paramount. So Netflix is the one that's spinning everything out into a spin with legacy media. Ellison could very well go to Trump like, "Hey, don't worry. We're going to keep CNN part of us." And We'll take care of CNN. Don't worry about it.</p>
</details>

> Steve：埃里森不是靠输才走到今天的。他不是靠收购失败才走到今天的。仅仅因为现在看起来Netflix赢了，并不意味着这事就过去了，也不意味着这事就结束了。派拉蒙可以去找股东，他们可以提出另一个交易，他们可以做成一些事。归根结底，他们有政府的快速拨号，而Netflix没有。政府不喜欢Netflix，但他们喜欢埃里森和埃里森团队。所以，当事情到了紧要关头，哦，没问题。你需要另外50亿来资助所有账户。别担心，我们会给你65亿。我们会和迈克尔·戴尔匹配。我们会给你更多，甚至更多用于特朗普的账户。别担心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> look, Ellison didn't get to where he is by losing. He didn't get to where he is by not getting acquisitions done. And just because it looks like Netflix won right now does not mean that this is going to pass and it does not mean that this is over. Paramount can go to the shareholders, they can come up with another deal and they can get something done. And at the end of the day, they do have the administration on speed dial, whereas Netflix does not. The administration is not a fan of Netflix, but they are a fan of Ellison and the Ellison team. So, when push comes to shove, oh, no problem. You need another five billion to fund all the uh accounts. Don't worry, we'll make it six and a half. We'll match Michael Dell. We'll we'll give you more even more for the Trump accounts. Don't worry.</p>

<p class="english-text">Okay. I I can't check that right now, but I'm sure it's better than Carvana's uh SoFi's dumping.</p>

</details>

> Steve：但我的意思是，SoFi难道不应该在这些公司之前入选吗？当然应该。有很多公司需要被剔除。Solstice今年下跌了2%。我不知道LKQ是什么。那只股票今年下跌了18%。这些公司的市值是多少？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> But this is what I mean, though. Like, like, should SoFi be in there before any of these names? Of course. Like, there's a lot of names that need to go. Solstice is down 2% on the year. I don't know what LKQ is. That stock is down 18% for the year. What's the market cap on these names?</p>

<p class="english-text">>> Yes. And it's a another seven billion dollar company.</p>
</details>

> Tanner：是的。我真的认为，像，差不多有200家公司甚至不再符合资格，因为它们已经失去了盈利能力，没有足够的交易量，或者市值低于200亿美元。这非常……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. I'm I'm seriously I think like something like it's almost 200 names are not even eligible anymore because they've fallen out of profitability. They don't have enough volume or they have less than a$20 billion market cap. It is very</p>
</details>

> Amit：很抱歉让所有期待今天S&P有劲爆消息的人失望了。我的意思是，这些都是相对无聊的名字，但事实就是如此。至少Carvana，我知道，是一个更大的散户熟知的名字，至少它有所行动。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> I'm sorry for everybody who wanted a a juicy S&P today. I mean, these are relatively boring names, but it is what it is. At least Carvana, I know, is a bigger retail name, and at least that one got to move.</p>
