### 利率同步性分析

**主持人**: 有一种普遍的看法认为，美国和加拿大的中央银行步调一致。这种说法有多大程度是真的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: It's a common view that the central banks in the US and in Canada are in lockstep. How true is that?

</details>

**嘉宾**: 这种说法相当准确。虽然不是百分之百准确，但确实很接近。我的意思是，加拿大经济与美国经济高度融合，所以当他们调整利率时，我们也跟着调整是很自然的。在过去大约25年里，我们基本上与他们保持同步，除了2000年初有几次，当时我们因为一个保险问题改变了价格，走出了自己的道路。那是一次暂时的偏离。然后在**大金融危机**期间，我们也未能完全跟随他们，因为他们陷入的麻烦比我们多得多。所以，他们降低了利率，而我们没有降那么多，但我们仍然与他们同步。我们只是把利率保持得稍高一些。而最近，在过去三年里，我们的利率与他们的不同。这部分是因为在美国，经济增长强劲。而这里（加拿大）的增长则没那么强劲。所以我们走出了自己的路，把利率保持得比他们低一点。但我们一直在同步，只是比他们稍低一点。所以毫无疑问，美国利率对加拿大利率的影响极其强大，两国联系极为紧密。

**Guest**: It's pretty true. It's not 100% true, but it's pretty true. I mean, the Canadian economy is so integrated with the United States that it makes sense that when they move their rates, we also move our rates. And over the course of, I'd say the last 25 years, we've been pretty much in lockstep with them, except for on a couple of occasions early in the 2000, we went our own way because we had an insurance issue that changed our prices. That was a temporary aberration. And then during the great financial crisis, we also didn't follow them exactly because they got themselves in an awful lot more trouble than we did. And so they lowered their rates more than we did, but we still moved in parallel to them. We just kept them a little bit higher. And then more recently, in the last, the last three years, we've been our rates have been different than theirs. And again, that's partly because in the in the United States, growth is strong. Here it's not as strong. And so we've gone our own way and kept rates lower a little bit lower than theirs. But we have moved every you know we're moving in parallel with them just a little bit lower. So there's no doubt the influence of American rates over Canadian rates is it's extremely strong and the ties are extremely strong.

### 政治干预争议

**主持人**: **特朗普**总统一直在向**美联储**现任主席**杰罗姆·鲍威尔**施压，要求其降低利率。请帮助我们理解这背后的争议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: President Donald Trump has been pressuring the current chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, to drop interest rates. Help us understand the controversy behind this.

</details>

**嘉宾**: 中央银行在过去一代人的时间里通过保持独立性而声名鹊起。这也是我们在许多国家能够控制通胀的方式。虽然不完美，但这是一个相当不错的实验，因为公众和投资者知道，他们的中央银行会采取行动，利用利率来控制通胀，而不是受某些政治冲动的影响。所以，当唐纳德·特朗普出现并试图向杰罗姆·鲍威尔施压以降低利率时，这可能具有相当大的破坏性。我们都知道，在潜意识里，很多政客都想要宽松的货币。他们希望利率低于控制通胀所必需的水平，因为这会降低借贷成本。这可能在短期内带来就业和增长的提振。这对选民来说感觉很好，对希望获得一些功劳的政客来说也感觉很好。只是通胀方面的长期影响，甚至中期影响可能相当可怕。投资环境的稳定性和不确定性也会被打破。所以，当唐纳德·特朗普向杰罗姆·鲍威尔施压，然后相应地更换美联储主席时，人们会提出很多问题，公众和投资者之间也存在很多猜测，关于事情是否还会像他们过去理解的那样运作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Guest**: So central banks have made their name over the course of the last generation by being independent. And that's the way we've been able to keep inflation under control in many rich countries. So. Well, I mean, it's not been perfect, but it's been fairly a fairly good experiment because because, you know, people in the public and investors know that their central banks will act and use interest rates to control inflation and not to control some of these political whims. And so when Donald Trump comes along and tries to put pressure on on Jerome Powell to cut interest rates, that's potentially quite destructive. You know, we know in the backs of our minds that a lot of politicians want easy money. They want to keep rates lower than they than they necessarily should be for inflation, because they lower rates. Insight investments, they could bring an immediate bump in terms of jobs and growth. And that feels good for for the for the voting public. And it feels good for a politician who wants some credit. It's just that the the longer term effects, or even the medium term effects on inflation could be quite devastating. And the effects on stability and the investment environment also thrown up into the air. So when Donald Trump is putting pressure on Jerome Powell and then changes, you know, changes the the chairman of the Federal Reserve accordingly, there are a lot of questions being asked and a lot of presumptions among the general public and, and among the, among investors about whether things are going to operate as they've understood them to operate in the past.

### 新任央行官员

**主持人**: 好的，我们来谈谈杰罗姆·鲍威尔的潜在继任者**凯文·沃什**。他已被提名，但仍需通过参议院的批准。到目前为止，市场反应如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Well, let's talk about Jerome Powell's potential replacement, Kevin Warsh. He has been named but still has to go through Senate. But what has the reaction been so far?

</details>

**嘉宾**: 嗯，**马克·卡尼**（前英国央行行长）表示这是个绝佳的选择。这是一个有趣的反应，因为我没想到马克·卡尼会如此迅速地回应一位央行官员的任命。显然，一位首相（指卡尼曾任加拿大总理）曾是一位央行行长，他对凯文·沃什有深入的了解，知道他是什么样的人。所以，好吧，是的，我们都想知道马克·卡尼对凯文·沃什的看法。这是一个有趣的反应。但绝非普遍。分析师们在审视这位被提名人时，都在说，他有着“鹰派”的历史，意味着他一直希望紧盯通胀，这与唐纳德·特朗普的做法完全相反。那这会如何运作呢？此外，关于他最近的“鹰派”言论，人们进行了大量有趣的研究。似乎沃什愿意在共和党总统领导下考虑降低利率。所以，我们正在解读他过去的一切行为，是通过政治而非货币政策本身。但毫无疑问，他拥有货币政策信誉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Guest**: Well, Mark Carney came out and said it was a fantastic choice. And that was an interesting reaction because I wouldn't have expected Mark Carney to respond so quickly to an announcement of a central banker. I mean, obviously, a prime minister used to be a central banker himself and has had many has has a lot of insight into Kevin Warsh and who who he is. And so, okay, yes, of course, we all want to know what Mark Carney thinks of Kevin Warsh. So that was an interesting reaction. But it's not a universal by any means. You know, there are a lot of analysts out there looking at the nominee and saying, okay, he's got a history of a hawk, meaning he has wanted to keep a tight grip on on inflation, which is not not Donald Trump at all. So how does that work? And then there's been a lot of interesting research into into his Warriors statements over, over the past little while. And it seems that there's a, there's there's some willingness on the part of Warsh to think about lower interest rates under a Republican president. So, you know, we're interpreting everything that he's done in the past through through politics rather than what he's done through through monetary policy per se. But there's no doubt he has got monetary policy credentials.

</details>

**主持人**: 如果是后者（指政治影响），那意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: If it is the latter, what does that mean?

</details>

**嘉宾**: 嗯，如果他有共和党倾向，或者对唐纳德·特朗普有同情，那么我们所有人都会密切关注这一点，这一点是肯定的。他必须说服美联储参与决策的所有其他人，让他们支持他的观点，因为这不仅仅是他一个人的决定，但他将具有极其重要的影响力。从长远来看，如果他是在为总统效劳，那么通胀和债券市场的借贷条件将会受到大量审查，这不仅在美国，而且在全球范围内都会如此。我们已经看到市场因他的提名而波动。黄金和白银的价格都大幅下跌。这两种金属此前都大幅上涨，部分原因是它们被用作对冲唐纳德·特朗普及其对美联储影响力的押注。所以，他提名了沃什，然后这两种金属的价格就大幅下跌。世界各地的货币也会因此波动，包括加拿大元。这影响了我们的借贷条件，也影响了我们经济的未来发展。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Guest**: Well, if he's got Republican tendencies and or if he's got some sympathy for for Donald Trump, he's we will everybody will be watching for that for sure. He has to persuade everybody else involved in making decisions at the Federal Reserve to go his way, because he's not just up to him, but he is extremely he will be extremely influential. And over the longer term, you know, if he's doing the if he's doing the president's bidding for him, there's going to be some, some an awful lot of scrutiny to see what happens to inflation and borrowing conditions in the bond market, not just in the United States but around the world. We're already seeing markets move as a result of his his nomination. We're seeing gold and silver mean both of those were just dropped precipitously over the last little while, partly because, you know, they were up really high in a hedge against Donald Trump and his influence over the over the over the Federal Reserve. So, you know, he named Warsh and then the prices of those those two metals fell dramatically. You know, currencies around the world will fluctuate based on on what he does, including the Canadian dollar. And so that influences our borrowing conditions, that influences our economy going forward.

### 未来展望

**主持人**: 赫瑟尔，在我们最后的30秒里，如果贸易紧张局势持续，美国和加拿大经济不再同步且融合度降低，我们能从加拿大央行的货币政策中期待什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Heather, in our last 30 seconds, if trade tensions continue and the U.S. and Canadian economies are no longer in lockstep and aren't as integrated, what can we expect from the Bank of Canada's monetary policy?

</details>

**嘉宾**: 所以，加拿大央行会采取相当直接的策略。他们专注于通胀。他们根据他们认为通胀将走向的方向来调整利率。我不认为这会改变。只是通胀的走向与美国发生的事情紧密相关。是的，我们听到了很多关于我们贸易要脱离美国的消息。但我认为，事实是我们仍然与他们高度融合，不仅是我们的贸易，更重要的是我们的金融市场和投资流动。因此，我预计我们将继续与美国同步，也许不是每一次，但会经常同步，在未来一段时间内都是如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Guest**: So the Bank of Canada plays a pretty straight. They are fixated with inflation. They raise and lower rates according to where they think inflation is going to go. And I don't expect that to change. It's just that what happens to inflation is very tied into what happens with the United States. And yes, we hear an awful lot about, you know, diverging our trade away from the United States. But I think the the fact of the matter is we are still very, very integrated with them, not just our trade, but our, more importantly, our financial markets and our investment flows. And so I expect we will be moving in lockstep, maybe not every single time, but frequently with the United States for some time to come.

</details>

**主持人**: 在你30年的经济政策报道中，你以前见过这样的情况吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: In your 30 years of reporting on economic policy, have you seen anything like this before?

</details>

**嘉宾**: 我没有。我的意思是，加拿大央行上周公布了他们的预测和对加拿大经济的评估，这很有趣。他们的第一段说，过去几个月一切都差不多。而他们的第二段说，但情况非常不可预测。我们不知道要去哪里。他们如此罕见地表示，他们看不到未来，所以基本上陷入瘫痪，因为他们无法弄清楚下一步会发生什么。我的意思是，我研究了过去几十年的全球金融危机，看到了很多颠覆，但我从未见过像现在这样，看不到前进的道路。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Guest**: I have not. I mean, it's interesting with the Bank of Canada, they came out with their forecast and their their assessment of the Canadian economy last week. And their first paragraph was saying everything is kind of the same over the last few months. And their second paragraph is, but it's so unpredictable. We have no idea where we're going. And that is very, very rare for them to say that they they can't see into the future at all so that, you know, basically paralysed because they can't figure out where things are going next. I mean, I've looked at financial crises around the world over the last few decades and seen a lot of disruption, but I've never seen anything like this in terms of not having a way forward.

</details>

**主持人**: 赫瑟尔，我们就此打住。非常感谢您的见解。非常感激。
