summary: 在经历数周下跌后，市场迎来强劲反弹，科技股普遍上涨。本轮上涨的核心驱动力是美联储降息预期的显著升温，旧金山和纽约联储主席的鸽派言论将降息概率推高至85%。此外，特朗普对华关系的积极表态、亚马逊在数据中心领域的巨额投资（合计650亿美元），以及白宫签署旨在加速AI研发的“创世纪计划”行政令，共同提振了市场情绪，尽管部分投资者仍对反弹的可持续性持谨慎态度。

title: 美联储降息信号提振市场，特朗普AI行政令与亚马逊巨额投资共推科技股反弹
---

### 市场迎来久违大涨，科技股全线飘红

大家好，欢迎回来。我们经历了几天，毫不夸张地说，市场一片惨淡。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market close. Let me know immediately if my audio is not doing too good. I think it should be okay, but if it's not, let me know. We are live. We are live. It's one of those days. We've had a few days to say the least that have been nothing but red.</p>
</details>

不过，今天情况有所改变。像今天这样的日子，你看到了一些变化。Nebus 上涨了 10%。谷歌股价逼近 319 美元，上涨 7%，市值达到 3.85 万亿美元。特斯拉股价为 418 美元。亚马逊上涨 2.3%。Bitmine 当日上涨 20%，要知道以太坊的涨幅都不到 20%。所以很明显，人们买入 BMR 的势头比以太坊更猛烈。SoFi 上涨 8%，Palantir 上涨 7%，Robin Hood 上涨 8%，美光上涨 8%，Meta 上涨 3.5%。**标普500指数**（S&P 500: 追踪美国500家大型上市公司股票表现的指数）非常接近突破 670 点。距离收盘还有 13 分钟，也许我们能收在 670 点以上。目前是 669 点。ESTs 上涨 6%，Rocket Lab 上涨 5%，Cipher 上涨 15%，Oscar 上涨 22%，Lemonade 上涨 7%，D-Wave 上涨 13%，Grab 上涨 7%，苹果上涨 2%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And well, you got a little bit of a change. You got a little bit of a change on a day like this. Nebus is up 10%. Google is pushing 319, up 7%, $3.85 trillion market cap. Tesla's at 418. Amazon's up 2.3. Bit mine is up 20% on the day. I mean, Ethereum is not up 20%. So, obviously, you got people that are buying into BMR a bit more aggressively than Ethereum. SoFi is up 8%. Palunteer's up 7%. Robin Hood's up 8%. Micron's up 8%. Meta is up 3.5. S&P 500 very close to breaking 670. We got 13 minutes left until the market closes. Maybe we will close above 670. We're at 669. ESTs is up six. Rocket Lab's up five. Cipher's up 15. Oscar is up 22. Lemonade's up seven. D-Wave's up 13. Grab is up seven. Apple's up two.</p>
</details>

为什么会这样？在经历了感觉上像整整一个月，实际上是大约三周的持续下跌之后，为什么市场会如此普涨？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why is this happening? Why are we going so green after what has felt like quite literally a month even though it's been about three weeks of nothing but red?</p>
</details>

### 降息预期成关键驱动力，美联储官员释放鸽派信号

在我给出原因之前，我在聊天区发起了一个投票：你相信这次上涨吗？这是我很好奇大家看法的问题。你相信吗？我想今天一整天，大家都在纠结是否该相信这次上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, first of all, before I give the reason, uh, put a poll right there in the chat. Do you trust it? Do you trust it? That is the question that I'm curious to see everyone's perspective on. Do you trust it? I think throughout the entirety of the day, everyone has been kind of struggling uh to figure out if they're going to trust it or not, but there might be a good enough reason to trust it.</p>
</details>

但或许有足够好的理由去相信它。大约一小时前发布的一则消息，我认为这真正巩固了我们今天看到的涨势。我的意思是，市场本来就已经上涨了，但这条头条新闻才是真正让我们有可能收涨的原因。旧金山联邦储备银行的一位行长支持**降息**（Rate Cut: 指中央银行降低基准利率）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This came out about an hour ago and uh this is what I think really solidified a lot of the green that we are seeing today. I mean, we were already green, but this headline is what really I think got us to end up potentially closing green. One of the Fed presidents from the San Francisco Federal Reserve is backing a rate cut.</p>
</details>

就是这样。上周五，纽约**美联储**（Federal Reserve: 美国的中央银行系统）主席约翰·威廉姆斯（John Williams）表示，他可能会支持降息。他被视为鲍威尔（Powell）的代言人。并非所有美联储主席的份量都一样，纽约和旧金山的主席往往更具影响力。当然，美联储主席杰罗姆·鲍威尔（Jerome Powell）的影响力最大。上周五，这条消息使降息的概率从 30% 飙升至 75%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There you go. Last Friday, John Williams, the Fed president of the New York Fed, said that uh he would likely have a rate cut. He is seen as a proxy to PAL. Not all Fed presence are created equal. The NYC one, the San Francisco one, they tend to matter a lot more. Obviously, JPL, the Fed chair, matters the most. That sent odds from 30% to 75% on Friday.</p>
</details>

今天，就在一小时前，东部时间下午 2:55，旧金山联储的玛丽·戴利（Mary Daly）表示她支持降息，理由是劳动力市场疲软。现在，降息的概率达到了 81%（准确地说是 80.9%），这远高于我们长期以来的水平。这可以说是过去几周我们看到的最高概率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Today, literally an hour ago, at 2:55 p.m. Eastern, you had Mary Dailyaly from the San Francisco Fed say that she supports a rate cut. She's citing the weak labor market. And now the probabilities on a rate cut are at 50 or sorry, 81%, 80.9, which is significantly higher than where we've been at for a long time. I mean, it's the highest we've seen over the past couple weeks.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为这就是原因。我认为是玛丽拯救了市场。玛丽和约翰·威廉姆斯似乎联手拯救了市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, I think that's the reason. I think Mary saved the day. Mary and John Williams together seem to have saved the day.</p>
</details>

### 多重利好消息提振市场情绪

还有很多其他看涨的头条新闻，我们稍后会讨论。特朗普对中国发表了一些积极言论。还有亚马逊，记得吗，他们早上宣布在弗吉尼亚州为美国政府投资 500 亿美元建设数据中心。现在他们又在印第安纳州投资 150 亿美元，我们稍后会谈到。他们投入的投资规模实在令人难以置信。谷歌股价为 318.884 美元。但实际上，我认为市场真正关心的是美联储降息概率的上升。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You got a lot of other headlines that are pretty bullish that we'll talk about. You had Trump say some good things about China. You have Amazon. Remember, they were investing 50 billion in the morning for data centers in Virginia for the United States government. They're investing another 15 billion in Indiana, which we'll talk about. It's just incredible the size of investment that they are putting up there. Google right there 318.884. But realistically, I think the Fed rate cut probabilities going higher is what the market really cared about.</p>
</details>

英伟达当天上涨了 1.42%。他们从第二位重要的美联储主席那里得到了确认，这是一件大事。哦，现在是 85% 了。哇，我刚刷新了一下。你们是对的，85%。好吧，我猜我忘了刷新，之前看到的是 80.9%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nvidia right there, they're up 1.42% on the day. The fact that they got confirmation from a second leading Fed president, that was a big deal. Oh, it's 85%. Wow, I just refreshed. You guys are right. 85. Okay, I guess I forgot to refresh. I had it at 80.9.</p>
</details>

当美联储的概率变得如此之高时，降息几乎是不可避免的。我这么说是因为，从鲍威尔以往的执政风格来看，他通常不会给市场带来意外。所以，如果市场真的倾向于某一个方向，他很可能会顺应市场的预期。当然，未来几天可能会发生一些事情，比如我们得到一些疯狂的通胀数据，导致这个概率下降。但距离 12 月 10 日的美联储会议只剩下大约三周了。我认为，正是这种降息概率的上升推动了市场的上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There you go. I mean, it is almost inevitable at this point when the Fed probabilities get this high. And the reason I'm saying that is because JPAL tends to not be a Fed president, just historically how he's governed, uh, to give the market a surprise. So if if it's really leaning towards one way or the other, he's probably going to give you what the market is suggesting. Now maybe something happens over the coming days. Maybe we get some crazy inflation data and that probability goes to the downside. But you only have about three weeks left until this Fed meeting on December 10th. And that right there is what I think we are uh seeing from a rate cut probability that's getting the market to go great.</p>
</details>

今天早上另一个好消息是关于特朗普和中国的。他在开市后发了这条推文。特朗普说：“我们与中国进行了一次很棒的通话。中美关系很牢固。我们正在取得重大进展。”他还表示他将于四月访问北京，而习主席也将访问美国。今天早上我们也看到习主席对中国官方媒体发表了一些评论，基本说了同样的话。所以，两位领导人在如何描述美中关系上是一致的。中国已经开始出口一些稀土并从美国购买一些大豆，但降息概率的上升确实起到了很大作用。当然，特朗普与中国的友好关系也有帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other piece of good news this morning was Trump and China. So, he tweeted this right after the market open was done. But Trump said, "We had a great call with China. The China relationship is strong. We're making significant progress." And he says he'll be visiting Beijing in April. And President Xi will be visiting in America. Now, we saw some of President Xi's comments this morning as well to Chinese state media. Basically said the same thing. So, both leaders are in agreement in terms of how they're talking about the relationship between the United States and China. China has already started exporting some of the rare earths and buying some of the soybeans from the United States, but those probabilities of rate cuts going higher um have really made a difference. And obviously Trump being buddy buddy with China, that also helps.</p>
</details>

### 市场情绪谨慎，反弹能否持续？

所以最大的问题是，你相信吗？你相信这次上涨吗？聊天室里 62% 的人说他们相信，37% 的人说“不，还不到时候”。我认为 60/40 是一个合理的分歧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the big question is, do you trust it? Do you trust the green? 62% of you in the chat say you trust the green. 37% say no, not yet. Uh, I think that's a reasonable spit uh split 6040.</p>
</details>

标普指数在今天最后五分钟试图冲击 670 点。看，670 点。哇，Nebus 刚刚出现了一根巨大的红色蜡烛图，然后又反弹了回来，Palantir 也是。标普指数也出现了一点红色蜡烛图，虽然没有 Nebus 那么大，但也在反转。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">S&P right here trying to go for 670 towards the end of the day in these last five minutes. There you go. 670. Wow. You just had a massive red candle on a Nebus and that's coming right back and on Palunteer. That's coming right back. And then you had a little bit of a red candle on the S&P. Not as big as on Nebius, but that one's reversing.</p>
</details>

哇，看看英伟达。看那个走势。就在收盘前，股价达到 183.28 美元，上涨了 2.44%。来回波动很大。我刚看到一些深红色的蜡烛图，现在它们都在这里被逆转了。在指数层面上，可能也在逆转。标普500指数目前在 669 点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow. Nvidia getting Look at that. Look at that. Right into the closing video. 18328 up 2.44%. Um, wow. Lots of back and forth. I mean, just saw some deep red candles. Old those are getting reversed right here. And definitely on the index index level might be potentially getting reversed. 669 right here on the S&P 500.</p>
</details>

总的来说，这是上涨的一天。市场看起来想以绿色收盘。未来几天我们将会知道这是否是一个真正的趋势。我认为比特币和以太坊是风险偏好情绪的领先指标，具有讽刺意味的是，股市一直在跟随比特币的走势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, it's a green day. Market looks like it wants to end out green. We're going to find out over the coming days if this is a real trend. Bitcoin and Ethereum I think are kind of your leading indicators right here of risk on which ironically the stock market has been following Bitcoin.</p>
</details>

尽管比特币相对于标普指数的波动性更大，导致其跌幅也更大，但总的来说，比特币下跌，市场就下跌；比特币上涨，市场也随之上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean bit obviously Bitcoin's uh delta towards the S&P has taken a much bigger dump because it's more volatile but nonetheless Bitcoin has gone down the market's gone down. Bitcoin has gone up the market has transitioned.</p>
</details>

我认为，当我们连续几周每周都挨上好几拳时，你就会开始记起看到股票上涨、资本增值是多么特别。这并不容易，这就是为什么这个游戏如此艰难。但是，在经历了几个艰苦的星期后，能看到一点喘息的机会真是太好了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think I think when you get punched multiple times in a week for multiple weeks in a row, uh you start to remember how special it is to see equities actually go up and have your capital compound. And it's not easy. This is why this game is so hard. But, uh after a grueling couple weeks, it is nice to see a little bit of reprieve.</p>
</details>

而且，这并不仅仅是因为**算法交易**（Algorithmic Trading: 利用计算机程序自动执行交易指令）的股票无缘无故地上涨。当然，这也是一部分原因。真正的原因是这次降息。就像上周，算法交易、追加保证金等因素放大了那个坏消息——降息概率降至 30%——的影响。这次你看到的是完全相反的情况。你看到算法和系统性买盘，而非卖盘，放大了与上周叙事相反的那个好消息——我们可能会降息。所以上周的故事是不会降息，这周的故事是会降息。我认为这就是你看到这种大逆转的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And again, it's not just because, you know, ALGO stocks are just going up for the hell of it. Obviously, that's a part of it. It really is this rate cut. Just like last week, you had Algos and margin calls, etc. compound on the one piece of bad news which was that rate probabilities went to 30%. You're seeing the exact opposite happen this time. You're seeing alos and system systemic buying versus selling compound on the one piece of good news that goes against the narrative we had last week which is that we might get the rate cut. So last week the story was not getting the rate cut. This week the story is getting the rate cut. And I think that's why you're seeing a sort of major U-turn right there.</p>
</details>

### 亚马逊持续加码AI基础设施投资

另一个可能让市场喜欢我们所见新闻的原因是关于亚马逊的。我们早上谈到过，亚马逊正在投资高达 500 亿美元来扩展人工智能基础设施和数据中心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Another update for why the market might be loving all the news that we're seeing is on Amazon. So, we talked about this in the morning. Amazon is investing up to $50 billion to expand AI infrastructure and data centers.</p>
</details>

亚马逊正在为美国政府机构投资 500 亿美元建设计算基础设施。这则消息是一小时前发布的。现在，亚马逊又在印第安纳州北部投资 150 亿美元，用于建设新的数据中心园区和推动人工智能创新。根据他们网站的说法，这将创造 1100 个就业岗位，并支持新的劳动力发展培训项目和当地社区项目。它还将为整个州增加 2.4 吉瓦的电力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amazon's investing 50 billion for computing infrastructure for US government agencies. This came out an hour ago. Uh Amazon is now investing another 15 billion in northern Indiana to build new data center campuses and advance AI innovation. This is going to create 1100 jobs as per their website and support new workforce development training programs and local community projects. It's also going to add 2.4 gawatts of uh electricity to the entire state.</p>
</details>

所以，在人工智能和数据中心领域，有两项非常重大的公告。我们还有一些来自 Claude 和阿里巴巴的更新，我们稍后也会谈到。但是，为美国政府基础设施投资 500 亿美元，现在又为他们在印第安纳州建设的整体数据中心投资 150 亿美元，这实在是太惊人了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you have two really major announcements in the world of AI and data centers. We also have some updates from Claude and Alibaba that we'll talk about as well. But um 50 billion in the United States government infrastructure investments and now 15 billion for an overall data center they're building in Indiana. It's just quite incredible.</p>
</details>

而你还有些人说所有这些数据中心的东西都是泡沫。然后你又看到亚马逊说，我们要投入更多的钱进去。我认为这在某种程度上反驳了那种说法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you got other people saying that all this data center stuff is a bubble. And then you have Amazon saying we are going to put more of our money into it. Which again I think just combats a little bit of the narrative.</p>
</details>

### Michael Burry 与英伟达的公开交锋

Michael Burry 刚刚发推文说：“英伟达给华尔街的卖方分析师发了一份备忘录，反驳我的论点。我坚持我的分析。显然，完整的分析无法在一条推文中容纳。我会在我的时间线上发布。”然后他附上了他的 Substack 链接。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, Michael Bur just tweeted, "In Nvidia, Nvidia emailed a memo to Wall Street sellside analysts to push back on my arguments. I stand by my analysis. Obviously, the full analysis does not fit in a tweet. I will release on my timeline." And then he plugs the substack.</p>
</details>

他说得对，英伟达确实给一群华尔街分析师发了邮件，说 Burry 的论点有点愚蠢。所以他在这点上是对的。这是确切的图片。英伟达发布了一份官方反驳，针对关于该公司的说法，并直接引用了 Michael Burry 在 X 上的推文。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, he is right. Nvidia did email a bunch of uh Wall Street analysts and said that Bur's arguments are kind of dumb. So, he is right about that. Here's the exact picture right here. Nvidia published an official rebuttal against the claims about the company and they literally cited Michael Bur's tweets on X.</p>
</details>

看起来 Burry 刚和世界上最有价值的公司展开了一场推特战。坦白说，这对他的生意有好处。Burry 的 Substack 每年收费 380 美元，有大约 4 万名订阅者。即使只有 50% 的人付费订阅，你也可以想象会有更多人付费。这家伙作为 Substack 作者，年入数百万。所以，如果你和地球上最重要的公司发生争执……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Looks like Bur just got into a uh tweet war with the most valuable company in the world. And quite frankly, it's got to be good for business. Bur is charging $380 a year. His Substack has like 40,000 subscribers. I mean, even if 50% of those people paid the subscription, which you would imagine even more would pay for that. I mean, the dude's making millions as a Substack writer. And so, if you're in a beef with the most important company on the planet,</p>
</details>

顺便说一句，《商业内幕》发表了他的一些内容，在其中一篇文章里，他有一个片段，毫不夸张地称英伟达为思科。他说英伟达是这个市场的又一个思科。所以他正在来回交锋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">by the way, uh, Business Insider published some of his content and uh, he he he in one of the tweets or in one of the articles, he has a segment where he he quite literally calls Nvidia Cisco. He says Nvidia is once again this market Cisco. And um so he's going back and forth. He is going back and forth.</p>
</details>

原话是这样的：“再一次，有一家思科公司处于一切的中心，为所有人提供工具和铲子，并伴随着宏大的愿景。”他写道，并指出思科在崩盘期间暴跌了 78%。“它的名字是英伟达。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This was the exact quote. And once again, there's a Cisco at the center of it all with the picks and shovels for all and the expansive vision to go with it. He writes after noting that Cisco plunged 78% during the crash. Its name is Nvidia.</p>
</details>

所以看起来英伟达很重视这件事，向官方卖方分析师发布了他们的回应，而 Michael Burry 将会继续与他们争论。如果说有什么好处的话，那就是这将创造一个非常好的智力项目，来回讨论这个牛市中人工智能本质的所有细微差别。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it looks like Nvidia took it seriously, published their response to the official sellside analysts, and Michael is going to go back and forth with I mean, if anything, it's going to create a really good intellectual project of going back and forth to discuss all the nuances of the nature of AI in this bull market.</p>
</details>

### 白宫签署“创世纪计划”，启动AI版“曼哈顿工程”

大卫·萨克斯（David Sacks）发了一条推文，我认为这非常能说明政府将要表达的立场。萨克斯说：“根据今天的《华尔街日报》，人工智能投资占到了 GDP 增长的一半。”这正是我们上周谈到的，**资本支出**（Capital Expenditure: 公司用于购买、维护或升级实物资产的资金）占了过去几年 GDP 的一半，基本上从 2023 年开始。如果出现逆转，将有衰退的风险。我们承担不起倒退的后果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you did have David Saxs and then we'll get into some of the AI headlines. the AISAR tweet. Um, something that I think is very indicative of what the administration is going to be saying. So, uh, David Sax says, "According to today's Wall Street Journal, AI investment accounts for half of GDP growth." This is exactly what we talked about last week, that capex was half of GDP over the past couple years, basically since 2023. A reversal would risk recession. We can't afford to go backwards.</p>
</details>

如果特朗普签署任何粗鲁的法案……我的意思是，特朗普上周确实发了一条关于联邦 AI 标准与州级标准对比的推文。所以也许这是一个行政命令，试图将 AI 标准全国化。特朗普知道我们不能通过停止 AI 增长来冒险陷入衰退。这就是为什么他在与扎克伯格会面时问他：“你花了多少钱？”他想确保扎克伯格花了很多钱，亚马逊花了很多钱，微软也一样。所以所有这些资本支出对于继续推动这个牛市至关重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I mean like if Trump signs anything that is rude. I mean Trump did have a tweet last week about the federal AI standards versus the statebased standards. So maybe it's an executive order kind of trying to nationalize what standards should look like for AI. Uh Trump knows there's no way that we can risk a recession by stopping the AI growth. That is, you know, that's why he asked Zucks, "How much are you spending?" When he had that meeting with him, he wanted to make sure that Zux was spending a lot of money. Amazon spending a lot of money, Microsoft. So all that capex spend is going to be incredibly important to continue this bull market to go further</p>
</details>

根据报道，这将会像一个人工智能版的“曼哈顿计划”。所以，它真正鼓励的是美国的实验室——国家联邦实验室、公私合作伙伴关系、能源领域——基本上是试图将所有这些不同的组成部分整合在一起，以真正提升美国的 AI 主导地位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">based on reporting. It's going to be kind of like a Manhattan project but for AI. So really encouraging laboratories in the US uh national federal laboratories, public private partnerships, uh energy, basically trying to bring all these different components together to really boost and increase AI dominance within the US.</p>
</details>

现在大卫·萨克斯的推文就说得通了。萨克斯发推文说：“我们不能在 AI 支出上倒退，它占我们 GDP 的一半。”作为 AI 领域的权威人物，如果特朗普签署的是这样的文件，那这条推文就很有道理了。我唯一困惑的是，为什么他们没有直播。对于一位几乎直播所有重要法案签署的总统来说，他们没有公开进行，这有点奇怪。但如果这真的像一个 AI 版的“曼哈顿计划”，如果它将是这样，那就意味着将有更多的资金和投资进入这个生态系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
p class="english-text">And now David Sax's tweet makes a lot of sense. Again, Sachs tweeted, "We cannot go back on the AI spending. It's half of our GDP." That tweet as the AISAR makes a lot of sense if that's what Trump is signing. My only point of confusion is why didn't they stream it for for a president who streams pretty much every big bill. It is kind of weird that they didn't do it publicly, but if it's kind of like a Manhattan project for AI, if that's what it's going to be, I mean, you're just talking about a lot more money and investment coming into the ecosystem.</p>

### AI 领域动态：模型竞赛与行业整合

Anthropic 今天发布了一款新模型。以下是关于该模型的更新，当然，谷歌和亚马逊也在这家公司持有股份。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Anthropic, they launched a new model today. Here's the update on that model and obviously Google and Amazon have a stake in this company as well.</p>
</details>

Anthropic 正在推出其迄今为止最强大的模型，名为 Opus 4.5。它是 Claude 系列的新旗舰产品，专为高级编码、代理工作流和金融建模等企业任务而构建。此次更新包括新的 Excel 和 Chrome 工具，以及一个名为“无限聊天”的功能，可以防止在长时间对话中出现内存中断。与此同时，Anthropic 承诺在未来十年内投入超过 800 亿美元用于计算，包括与微软 Azure 的新支出承诺以及其在美国各地的自建数据中心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Anthropic is launching its most powerful model yet. It's called Opus 4.5 and it is the new flagship of the Claude family built for advanced coding, aentic workflows, and enterprise tasks like financial modeling. The update includes new Excel and Chrome tools and a feature called infinite chat that prevents memory cut offs and long conversations. And it comes as Enthropic commits more than 80 billion dollars to compute over the next decade, including a new spend commitment with Microsoft Azure and its own custommade data centers across the United States.</p>

但在这场模型竞赛中，有人会说 Anthropic 的主要竞争对手现在是谷歌的 Gemini 3。它上周登上了基准测试的榜首。Salesforce 的马克·贝尼奥夫（Marc Benioff）表示，在使用 Gemini 3 后，他再也不会回到 ChatGPT 了。所以我们真的看到这场竞争正在升温。

<p class="english-text">But in terms of this model race, some would argue that Anthropic's chief rival is now Google Gemini 3. It hit the top of the benchmarks last week. Salesforce's Mark Beni off said he would never go back to chat GBT after using Gemini 3. So we're really seeing this rivalry heat up.</p>

阿里巴巴的新聊天机器人上线一周内下载量就突破了 1000 万。但这强化了华尔街在 AI 时代开始认识到的一个模式：真正突破性的产品来自拥有完整系统的公司。这意味着模型、分销、基础设施和数据。这对阿里巴巴来说是一个证明点，就像上周 Gemini 3 对谷歌一样，证明该公司拥有其竞争对手所没有的东西，那就是一个完整的技术栈或端到端系统。

<p class="english-text">Baba, that was up 5%. Their new chatbot against OpenAI has hit 10 million downloads in a week. But it reinforces the pattern that Wall Street is starting to appreciate in the AI era. And that is that real breakout products come from companies with the full system. That means models, distribution, infrastructure, data. It's a proof point for Alibaba, much like Gemini 3 was for Google last week, that the company has something that its rivals do not, and that is a full stack or an endtoend system.</p>

看看这两家公司在过去一年的比较。两者在 AI 时代初期基本上都被忽视了，但却是今年最大的赢家之一，股价几乎翻了一番。在拥有完整生态系统方面，他们都有自己的模型，都有云业务，有拥有大量数据的成熟产品，还有定制芯片——尽管谷歌的 TPU 在这方面要领先得多。

<p class="english-text">Look at how the two companies compare over the last year. Both basically dismissed early in the AI era, but two of the biggest winners this year, nearly doubling their stock price. And when it comes to having a complete ecosystem, they both have their own models. They both have cloud businesses, established products with tons of data and custom silicone. though Google's TPU is much further along here.</p>

阿里巴巴明天早上公布财报，投资者面临的问题是，推动谷歌上涨的牛市论点现在是否也能适用于阿里巴巴。正如我们向你展示的，这两家公司的股价今年都翻了一番，但估值上存在差异。阿里巴巴仍然落后，其远期市盈率约为 23 倍。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Now Alibaba reports tomorrow morning Dom and the question for investors is whether the same bull thesis powering Google can now travel to Alibaba. As we showed you shares have doubled this year both those companies but the valuation there's a difference here Alibaba still lags at about 23 times forward earnings.</p>

### 市场反思：AI时代的机遇与挑战

一个充满活力的衍生品市场需要三种不同的市场参与者达到均衡：你有观点并进行投机的投机者；你有试图转移风险的套期保值者；然后你有第三类群体，即套利者。套利者基本上是在玩一种低风险、低延迟的游戏。

<details>

<p class="english-text">what makes a a vibrant derivatives market is three different market participants In equilibrium, you have the speculators who have a point of view on what the price should be and they're speculating. Uh, and some people call speculators gamblers, but if the technical derivatives parlance, it's it's speculators. But you need them also because you also have the a hedgers. And the hedgers are trying to offload risk. But not everyone can be hedging because then the price gets out of whack. So you need the speculators to actually bring the hedgers into equilibrium. And then you have the third group which is the arbitrageers. The arbitrurers are basically playing a lowrisk, low latency game.</p>

他（弗拉德）说，越来越多的人将通过玩游戏和做其他我们现在认为是休闲的工作来获得报酬。想想国际象棋，这是人工智能最早实现超人表现的智力领域之一。1997 年“深蓝”击败卡斯帕罗夫后，人们曾说国际象棋已死。现在，近 30 年后，国际象棋产业的规模扩大了 5 到 10 倍，特级大师的数量增加了 3 倍以上，还有大量网红通过下棋建立了自己的事业。

Now nearly 30 years later, the chess industry is 5 to 10x bigger with over 3x the grand masters and there's tons of influencers that literally have built a career off playing chess.</p>

他认为，在人工智能的世界里，越来越多的人将使用预测市场、股票市场以及不同形式的套利作为谋生方式，如果你有劳动力最终被商品化，而你有更多创造力的洞察力。

Stability AI 的创始人昨晚在一个播客中说：“我们还有一千天的时间，人工智能就将开始彻底摧毁整个就业市场。”他的论点是，人工智能将从根本上终结资本主义。

<p class="english-text">By the way, there was a podcast, I didn't listen to the whole thing last night, but the founder of Stability AI, he did a podcast last night and he says, "We have a thousand days, I'll link the pod if anyone wants to listen to it. He says, "We have a thousand days before um AI completely starts destroying the entire job market." And I don't know if you want to say he's a bit of a doomer. I mean, he has an AI company. There's definitely some doomerism in how he's talking about it. But I was just curious to hear the perspective. And the perspective is that AI is getting so good that most jobs his argument is AI will essentially end capitalism</p>

如果从逻辑的极端来看，是的，技术上它可能会。如果每个人都失业，没有商品或服务被生产，因为没有人能负担得起。但它是否也会激励资本主义的形式来创造新的机会？至少这是乐观的看法。

<p class="english-text">which if you take it to its logical extreme yeah I mean it technically could if everyone loses their jobs and there's no goods or services being produced because no one can afford it.
