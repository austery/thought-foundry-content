### Michael Burry的AI与Palantir空头及媒体素养

**Jason:** 大家好，Chamath和Friedberg都在。但Sacksy Poo昨晚在白宫待到很晚，今天来不了了，我们稍后会展示一些照片。不过，我们还是开始吧，我们想为你们准备一期节目，并及时在周末前呈现。我们先从Michael Burry和他的空头头寸说起。你们都知道Michael Burry，他是电影《**大空头**》（The Big Short: 一部讲述2008年金融危机前少数人预见并做空市场的电影）中的资本配置者，他刚刚撤销了在**SEC**（Securities and Exchange Commission: 美国证券交易委员会）的注册。他针对人工智能和Palantir进行了大笔押注。几周前，他披露了对Palantir的空头头寸，虽然规模不大。CNBC报道称其价值约为9亿美元，但Burry表示CNBC错了，实际只有900万美元。他提出了一个非常有趣的指控，这与我们节目中一直在讨论的关于建设的问题有关。

<p class="english-text">Alright, everybody. Chamath is here. I'm here. Freberg's here. But Sacksy Poo, he was up late at the White House. We'll show some pictures later. He couldn't make it today. But let's get started. We wanted to get you a show and we wanted to get it to you on time for your weekend. Let's start with Michael Burr in his shirt. So you guys know Obviously, Michael Burry, he's the capital allocator from the big short, and he just deregistered his firm with the SEC. He made a big bet against AI and Palantir. He disclosed the shorts against Palantir a couple of weeks ago. They weren't huge. CNBC apparently reported that the value was like 900 million. Burry says CNBC was wrong that it was just 9 million, but he had a really interesting accusation and it's related to what we've been talking about here on the show with the buildout of Can we come sorry, but can we just talk about the complete and total financial illiteracy of the mainstream media? How do you how do you confuse? 9,000,000 and 900 million. How do you do that? I think maybe it's the cost of the shorts versus the value of the stock that the shorts represent. No, it's because there's a hundred shares per option. So they were. I see. Yes. Because the options have a hundred. Of course. They applied a multiple and they got it wrong. Got it. Okay. Yeah. So the math, the calculator. Is they got it? It's not that they got the calculator wrong. It's just that they're so uninvested in assets that they don't know how asset markets work, I think is the more logical explanation. Meaning if you've ever bought a home, you probably know what people are talking about when they're talking about. financial elements related to a home. But I guess if you've never owned a stock or you've never hedged a position or had an option, you don't really know how any of it works. But then the problem isn't the person that wrote it, then there's no fact checking and the whole thing just gets an entire news cycle on its own, which by the way, helped his short and it never should have.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 抱歉，我们能谈谈主流媒体在金融方面的完全无知吗？你怎么能把900万美元和9亿美元搞混？你是怎么做到的？

<p class="english-text">Can we come sorry, but can we just talk about the complete and total financial illiteracy of the mainstream media? How do you how do you confuse? 9,000,000 and 900 million. How do you do that?</p>
</details>

**Friedberg:** 我想也许是空头头寸的成本与空头头寸所代表的股票价值之间的混淆。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think maybe it's the cost of the shorts versus the value of the stock that the shorts represent.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 不，那是因为每个期权有100股。所以他们……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">No, it's because there's a hundred shares per option. So they were.</p>
</details>

**Friedberg:** 我明白了。是的，因为期权有100股。当然，他们应用了一个乘数，然后算错了。明白了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I see. Yes. Because the options have a hundred. Of course. They applied a multiple and they got it wrong. Got it. Okay.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 是的，所以这个数学计算器……他们不是算错了计算器。只是他们对资产市场不了解，我认为这是更合理的解释。意思是，如果你买过房子，你可能知道人们在谈论与房子相关的金融元素时在说什么。但我想如果你从未拥有过股票，或者从未对冲过头寸，或者从未持有过期权，你就不真正知道它是如何运作的。但问题不在于撰写者，而是没有事实核查，整个事件就形成了一个完整的新闻周期，顺便说一句，这帮助了他的空头头寸，而这本不应该发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So the math, the calculator. Is they got it? It's not that they got the calculator wrong. It's just that they're so uninvested in assets that they don't know how asset markets work, I think is the more logical explanation. Meaning if you've ever bought a home, you probably know what people are talking about when they're talking about. financial elements related to a home. But I guess if you've never owned a stock or you've never hedged a position or had an option, you don't really know how any of it works. But then the problem isn't the person that wrote it, then there's no fact checking and the whole thing just gets an entire news cycle on its own, which by the way, helped his short and it never should have.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 因为如果你听说某个普通人对市场下了900万美元的赌注，你不会在意。但如果制造一个关于某人的头条新闻——

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because if you heard that some random dude had a $9 million bet against the market, you would think nothing of it. But then to manufacture a headline about somebody--</p>
</details>

**Chamath:** 这说得有道理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- That's a good point.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** ——他曾有过一个高光时刻，虽然差不多20年前了，但不管怎样，他曾有过一个高光时刻，他当时做对了，现在他做空市场，而你却把数量级弄错了两倍，这看起来非常错误。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- Who had a moment, it was almost 20 years ago, but whatever, he had a moment where he was kind of right, is short the market and you get it two orders of magnitude wrong, that seems quite wrong.</p>
</details>

**Friedberg:** 是的，正如你所说，这确实产生了影响，而且是错误的。它对已经存在的**AI泡沫**（AI Bubble: 人工智能相关公司估值过高，存在泡沫风险的现象）造成了阻力，这个泡沫在Brad Gerstner引爆后正在萎缩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- Yeah, and to your point, there is a ramification of it, which is it is wrong. created a headwind against the already AI bubble, which was deflating after Brad Gerstner popped it.</p>
</details>

**Chamath:** 我要进入阴谋论环节了。也许这个人并非经济文盲，而是恰恰相反，他故意写下错误，知道任何需要审查它的人都完全不明白他在说什么，然后他们自己也做空了。所以我想知道CNBC是否应该调查这个人是否真的有交易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- I'll take a walk down conspiracy corner. Maybe the actual person is not economically illiterate, but the exact opposite, and then writes the error on purpose, knowing that whoever has to review it has absolutely no idea what they're talking about, and then they themselves are short. So I wonder if CNBC should investigate. whether this person actually had a trade-off.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 哦，来了，阴谋论环节。我们戴上锡箔帽吧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- Oh, there you go, conspiracy corner. Let's get our Tim Fowl hat.</p>
</details>

**Chamath:** 这个人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- The individual.</p>
</details>

**Chamath:** 你要么是个彻底的傻瓜，不懂金融市场如何运作，在这种情况下，你可能应该在其他媒体机构工作，而不是在CNBC报道市场；要么……你非常了解它们如何运作，并且知道你上面的人一无所知。所以你自己做空市场。你基本上是在复制Burry的交易。但你重写了标题，使其看起来规模大了两个数量级，如果你看到一个巨大的空头头寸，这实际上可能会影响市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You're either a complete moron and you don't know how the financial markets work, in which case you probably should be working at some other media outlet, not CNBC covering the markets, or... You know how well they work and you know the people above you have no idea. And so you yourself shorts the market. You're basically copying the burry trade. But then you rewrite the headline to look like it's two orders of magnitude bigger, which actually could have moved the market if you saw a yard short.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 我的意思是，是的，如果我读到这个，那可能确实会引起我的注意。10亿美元，你知道，这是一个合理的头寸。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, yeah, like that would have probably gotten my attention had I read it. A billion dollars is, you know, reasonable position to have.</p>
</details>

### AI硬件折旧的会计争议

**Jason:** 他还指责，他做空了Palantir，但在人工智能方面，他说：“嘿，Meta和Oracle一直在**做假账**（Cooking the books: 指公司通过不正当的会计手段虚报或隐瞒财务数据），通过1760亿美元的隐藏折旧，在2028年将收益夸大了20%以上。”所以，这是图表。基本上，我们讨论过**H100**（H100: 英伟达推出的一款高性能GPU芯片）这种英伟达芯片，或者说英伟达服务器的合理寿命是多久。这些东西是三年、四年、五年还是六年寿命？CoreWeave可能将其定为六年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He was accusing also, he's got the Palincher short, but on the AI side, he was saying, "Hey, Metta and Oracle have been cooking the books." with 176 billion in hidden depreciation to inflate earnings by over 20% in 2028. And so, here's the chart. Basically, we've talked about what is the reasonable life of an H100 of an Nvidia chip or really an Nvidia server, if you think of it that way. Do these things have a three-year lifespan, a four or five, six-year lifespan? CoreWeave might be putting them at six-year.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 这极大地改变了你的开支，当然，考虑到数据中心建设的规模，这可能会彻底改变你的收益，因为将一个耗资1000亿美元的数据中心的成本除以六或三，结果会是两倍。所以，Friedberg，你的看法是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that. dramatically changes your expenses, which then of course, given the scale of the data build out, the data center build out could radically change your earnings because dividing the cost of a data center that cost 100 billion by six or three is, you know, 2X. So your thoughts, Freeburn?</p>
</details>

**Friedberg:** 是的，我们来进入会计环节，这是我们在All In播客中最喜欢但最少涉足的环节。磨尖你的铅笔！

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, so just to go into accounting corner, it's our most favorite, but least often visited a corner here on the All In podcast. Sharpening your pencils!</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 是的，所以……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, so in accounting,</p>
</details>

**Friedberg:** 我们需要一个会计环节的广告歌。磨尖你的铅笔！拿出你的计算器！根据**GAP**（Generally Accepted Accounting Principles: 公认会计原则）标准，当你作为上市公司或GAP申报人每季度报告运营费用时，你会将你的**资本支出**（CapEx: Capital Expenditure: 资本支出，指用于购买、改进或延长固定资产使用寿命的费用），即你进行的任何大额投资，在其寿命期内进行**折旧**（Depreciation: 资产价值随时间或使用而减少的会计处理）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we need a jingle for accounting corner. Sharpening your pencils! Get your calculator! Under GAP standards, he's generally accepted accounting principles. When you report your operating expenses every quarter as a public company or a gap filer, you take your capex, anything that you make a big investment in and you depreciate it over some lifetime.</p>
</details>

**Friedberg:** 并且有一个会计流程，你可以通过内部审查来确定，如果你的折旧计划与实际情况不符，你就应该进行调整。所以会定期进行评估。为了让你了解一下数学，Jason，谷歌在过去12个月里创造了1200亿美元的营业利润。好的，假设他们今年有700亿美元的资本支出。这700亿美元的资本支出在他们报告收益时不会从他们的营业利润中扣除。你将这700亿美元除以所谓的“有用寿命”，然后每年报告。所以，如果你按三年计算，正如你所说，每年大约是240亿美元，而按六年计算，每年是120亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there's an accounting process by which you can do an internal review and determine that if your depreciation schedule doesn't actually map. to reality, you should make an adjustment. And so there's a periodic assessment that's done to do that. And just to give you a sense to your point, Jason, on the math, Google in the last 12 months made $120 billion in operating profit. Okay, and let's assume they're making 70 billion in CapEx this year. That CapEx does not get deducted from their operating profit when they report earnings. You take the 70 billion and you divide it by what's called its useful life and you report that every year. So if you do it over three years, to your point, it's about 24 billion a year versus six years, it's 12 billion a year.</p>
</details>

**Friedberg:** 所以，如果三年和六年之间有差异，这会影响大约10%的营业利润。因此，Michael Burry说的是，所有这些超大规模公司都将其数据中心的折旧计划或有用寿命延长了大约两倍，这使得他们在报告收益时，运营成本减半。因此，这使得他们的收益膨胀。所以他声称他们在做假账。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that would impact the operating profit by on the order of call it 10%. if the difference between three and six years. And so what Michael Burry's saying is that all of these hyperscalers have extended their depreciation schedule or the useful life of their data centers by roughly 2X, which cuts the operating costs in half when they report it in earnings. And so it's making their earnings inflate. So he's claiming they're cooking the books.</p>
</details>

**Friedberg:** 但是，如果你回到你展示的图表，或者我可以直接说，谷歌在2021年第一季度首次进行了这项更改，他们说服务器的寿命现在从三年延长到四年。图表显示的是服务器和网络设备的组合。另外，在2021年，谷歌将网络设备的寿命从三年延长到五年，然后在2023年又从五年延长到六年。所以这是他们进行分析的结果。那么发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But if you go back to the chart that you showed, or I could just speak to this, Google first made this change in Q1 of '21, where they said the servers are now going from three to four years. The chart shows the combination of servers and networking equipment. Separately, in 2021, Google took networking equipment from three to five years, and then in 2023, they took it from five to six years. And so this is a result of this effort where they went in and did an analysis. So what happened?</p>
</details>

**Friedberg:** 数据中心发生的变化是，它们从主要用于数据存储和数据传输系统（使用硬盘和**随机存取存储器**（RAM: Random-Access Memory: 随机存取存储器，一种计算机存储器））转变为数据处理中心，这是因为人工智能的蓬勃发展。因此，随着人工智能在数据中心中变得越来越重要，投入数据中心的资金更多地分配给了芯片，而不是数据存储。最初的数据存储是硬盘，你每18或36个月就会淘汰硬盘。然后是固态存储器。固态存储器根据你使用的类型，可以使用两年、四年、六年，以及RAM。RAM的寿命也具有这种可变性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What happened in the data centers is that the data centers transitioned from being primarily data storage and data transfer systems where you would use hard drives and RAM and memory to store data and then transmit it back out to being data processing centers because of the AI boom. So as AI became more important in the data center, more of the dollars that are going into data centers were allocated towards chips, from data storage, which initially was hard drives, and you throw away the hard drives every 18 or 36 months. And then solid state memory. Solid state memory would last two years, four years, six years, depending on the type of memory you're using, and RAM. And RAM had this kind of variable lifetime as well.</p>
</details>

**Friedberg:** 然后，当你突然投入这些处理器来处理数据以进行人工智能时，这占据了大部分开支和大部分能源，都流向了处理器。所以如果你播放这段视频，这是谷歌人工智能和基础设施负责人最近在一次会议上发言。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then suddenly when you put these processors in to process the data to do AI, that's the majority of the spend and the majority of the energy is going towards the processors. So if you pull up this clip, this is Google's head of AI and infrastructure, Speaking at a conference here recently.</p>
</details>

**Friedberg:** 你认为我们在资本支出周期中处于什么位置？但更重要的是，你们内部在思考时使用哪些信号？我的意思是，你必须提前四五年规划数据中心，你必须购买核反应堆等等。那么，你如何考虑需求信号以及你的技术信号？Jeet，你也是一样，但要从企业和新云的角度来看。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Where are we, do you think, in the CapEx spend cycle? But more importantly, what are the signals that you guys use internally, right, in your thinking? I mean, you have to plan data centers, whatever, four or five years in advance. You have to buy nuclear reactors and whatnot. So how do you think about the demand signals as well as your technology signals? And Jeet, the same thing for you, but from the point of view of enterprise and new cloud, et cetera.</p>
</details>

**Friedberg:** 我会说，我们正处于周期的早期，当然是相对于我们看到的需求而言。我们的内部用户，我们已经构建**TPU**（Tensor Processing Unit: 谷歌开发的用于机器学习的专用集成电路）十年了，所以我们现在有七代产品用于内部和外部使用。我们七八年前的TPU利用率达到了100%。我认为这是关键所在。我打了一些电话，也向其他朋友咨询了，所有人都说同样的事情，这些七八年前的TPU和**GPU**（Graphics Processing Unit: 图形处理器）仍然在使用，并且利用率达到100%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're early in the cycle is what I would say, certainly relative to the demand that we're seeing. Our internal users are, we've been building TPUs for 10 years, so we have now seven generations in production for internal and external use. Our seven and eight-year-old TPUs have 100% utilization. And I think that's the key part that's been going on. I made some calls and I checked around with some other friends and everyone says the same thing, that these seven and eight year old TPUs and GPUs that are sitting in the data centers are still being used and they're being used at 100% utilization.</p>
</details>

**Friedberg:** 所以这实际上证明并验证了折旧计划可以更长而不是更短。我实际上认为Michael Burry搞错了。Chamath，你觉得呢？你显然参与了推理。Grok的推理会持续多久？而且看起来，正如Friedberg和视频中的先生所说，还有其他工作要做，对吧？所以当这些东西进入生命周期的后期时，它们仍然会有用武之地。我想问题是，你什么时候会真正拔掉它们的插头，停止使用它们？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that actually justifies and validates the depreciation schedule being much longer versus shorter. And I actually think Michael Burry's got this wrong. Jamath, what do you think? You're involved in, obviously, inference. How long will the Grok inferences be out there doing jobs? And it does seem like, to Freyberg's point, and the gentleman in the video, that there are other jobs to do, right? Like, so as these things move down the life cycle, there'll be something for them to do. When would you actually unplug them, I guess, is the question, and stop using them?</p>
</details>

**Chamath:** 这些公司的商业模式太好了，以至于它们不会走到耗尽所有其他运营策略，然后不得不做假账的地步。这些公司不是会做假账的那七家公司。Michael不够懂技术，无法理解实际发生的事情是，内核的运作方式、这些模型的意图机制如何被重写、人们如何在这些设计中用**SRAM**（Static Random-Access Memory: 静态随机存取存储器，一种速度快但成本高的存储器）替换**HBM**（High Bandwidth Memory: 高带宽内存，一种高性能内存接口）、以及他们如何在某些情况下构建巨大的芯片，在某些情况下构建更小的芯片组，所有这些都创造了越来越多的利用率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The business models of these companies are just far too good for them to get to the point of having exhausted every other operational tactic that then they have to cook the books. These are not the seven companies that are going to cook the books. The practical thing that's happening that Michael is not technical enough to understand is that there are... meaningful iterations in how kernels are working, in how the intention mechanisms of these models are being rewritten, in how people are swapping out HBM for SRAM in these designs, in how they're building in some cases really huge dies, in some cases much smaller chiplets. All of this creates more and more utilization.</p>
</details>

**Chamath:** 所以这些东西寿命更长，而且它们也需要更多。我认为要提出这些指控，你需要具备一定的技术基础，而我认为他没有。做空通常是这样的，我不喜欢做空，所以让我这样说。它本应是对金融渎职行为的制约，但事实并非如此。当你审视这些做空公司时，每当其中一家真正揭露了渎职行为，实际上是它们打着言论自由的幌子制造混乱和影射。它们发布一些旨在影响市场的言论，在言论发布前就对股票进行布局，然后希望平仓并赚钱。我认为这是一种相当可悲和糟糕的生活方式。但它是合法的，所以你被允许这样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So these things last longer, and they also need more. I think that in order to make these accusations, you need to have some modicum of technical grounding that I don't think he has. Here's the thing with shorts in general, which I don't like shorting, so let me just say this. There's supposed to be a check on financial malfeasance, but it's not that. When you look at these short selling firms, for every one of them, that actually uncovers malfeasance, what it really is, is them creating chaos and innuendo under the guise of their right to free speech. And what they do is they put out some screed that tries to move the market, they're positioned against the stock before it comes out, and then they hope to close the position out and make some money. I think that's a just a pretty sad and terrible way to live one's life. But it's legal and so you're allowed to do it.</p>
</details>

**Chamath:** Michael变得技术娴熟几乎毫无意义，因为他可能就不会写那篇文章了。而且，正如你所说，如果你是Michael Burry，如果你做了《大空头》，并且正确地做空了住房危机，你就能制造恐惧、不确定性和怀疑。当然，他花了两年时间才被证明是正确的。所以在他的辩护中，这些事情执行起来是很痛苦的。它们不赚钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It almost makes no sense for Michael to become technically literate Because he probably wouldn't have written it. So And to your point the fear uncertainty doubt you can create If you're a Michael Burry if you did the big short and you sure did the housing crisis correctly now that took two years For him to be correct. So these things are painful to execute on in his defense. They don't make any money.</p>
</details>

**Chamath:** 看看我的风险基金之外，我经营对冲基金七八年了。这是我们的多头头寸，你可以在网上找到这些片段。2015年的特斯拉，2016年的亚马逊，2018年的Salesforce。Salesforce 2018年，刚刚标记了。你知道我在空头方面赚了多少钱吗？因为我们总是觉得必须对冲。所以我们所做的就是四处寻找空头，但从未赚到钱。我们找到的唯一一个空头是一家无线电信运营商，那是一个合法的欺诈。它的公司注册地址是巴塞罗那的一家披萨店。多元化的收入来源。否则，我的观点是，做空就是某人有能力在剧院里喊“着火了”，说实话。在2025年，作为一家上市公司，进行金融欺诈是极其困难甚至不可能的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look outside of my venture fund. I ran a hedge fund for, I don't know, seven years, eight years. And here are our longs, okay? And you can find these clips on the internet. Tesla in 2015, Amazon 2016, Salesforce 2018. Salesforce 2018. just tagged it. And you know how much money I made on the short side because we always felt like we had to hedge. And so what we would do is we would bumble around looking for shorts, never made any money. The one short we found was a wireless telecom operator and it was a legitimate fraud. Its company's corporate address was a pizza parlor in Barcelona. Diversified revenue streams. Otherwise, my point is, it's just that shorting is just somebody's ability to cry fire in a theater, quite honestly. It's extremely hard to impossible to commit financial fraud as a public company in 2025.</p>
</details>

### Palantir的独特价值与高估值

**Jason:** 我想我们应该看看另一个空头头寸，那就是Palantir，因为Palantir，天哪，它的估值太高了。**Alex Karp**（Alex Karp: Palantir的首席执行官）一直在做一些很棒的采访。他是一个国宝，非常有趣。他们显然有一个很棒的业务。根据他们上个季度的报告，他们的年化收入达到了35亿美元，但估值却是4800亿美元。这意味着他们的销售额是137倍。这太惊人了，远远超出了正常范围。DataDog和Snowflake，微软，你知道，它们的销售额是13倍。我想Cloudflare是37倍，CrowdStrike是30倍。所以Friedberg，如果Palantir的市销率与其他那些高估值的公司相同，它可能是一家600亿到700亿美元的公司，每股29美元而不是170美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- I guess the other shirt we should take a look at is the Palantir one, because Palantir is, man, it's way out there. Alex Scarpe has been doing some great interviews. He's a national treasure, incredibly entertaining. They obviously have a great business. They're on a $3.5 billion run rate according to their last quarter, but the valuation is 480 billion. This puts them at 137 times their sales. It is extraordinary. It's way out there. Data dog and snowflake. Microsoft, you know, these are at 13 times their sales. And I guess Cloudflare is out there at 37 and crowd strike at 30. So this is truly an outlier Friedberg, if you were to give Palantir the same price to sales ratio as some of those highly valued ones, probably be a $6070 billion company $29 a share instead of 170. So</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 你怎么看他对Palantir的空头头寸？他在这里用了这个。

**Friedberg:** 根据你刚才的说法，你认为一家公司的价值取决于其历史销售数据。我认为股东通常不会，或许也不应该，这样看待他们所购买的东西，即他们所购买的企业未来的所有权权益。当你投资一家初创公司时，你并不是说：“嘿，那家初创公司的价值取决于员工去年做了什么。”甚至在他们开始公司之前，你是在押注企业未来的潜力，以及你认为随着时间的推移会产生的现金流。你的时间范围可能与我的不同，这就是市场如何找到价格的方式。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Based on the statement you just made, you're saying that a company is worth their historical sales numbers. And I don't think that that's how shareholders often do or perhaps should think about what they're buying, which is an ownership interest in the future of the enterprise that they're buying a piece of. When you invest in a startup, you're not saying, "Hey, that startup is worth what the employees did last year." before they even started the company, you're making a bet on the future potential of the business and what you think the cash generation over time will be. Your time horizon may be different than mine, and that's how a market finds a price.</p>
</details>

**Friedberg:** 因此，我认为市场可能正在为Palantir寻找一个价格，人们对其业务的未来潜力存在巨大分歧，因此对其未来不同时间尺度的盈利能力也存在分歧。这就是他们得出当前市场价格的方式。我有什么资格评判呢？如果我将自己的资本投入这家企业，我将根据自己的时间尺度和对该企业未来的估计做出自己的决定。我没有很好地研究过这家企业。我对其业务相对于其未来盈利潜力的价值没有强烈的观点或看法。我将这样看待它。如果我购买股票，我将进行长期投资，而不是看去年的数据，然后说存在估值套利机会，这就是我所购买的。

<p class="english-text">As a result, I think there's probably a market trying to find a price for Palantir where folks have a great deal of difference in opinion. over what the future potential of the business is. And as a result, what the earnings generation will be at different timescales in the future. And that's how they're getting to the current market price. Who am I to judge? I am the person who would make my own decision of my own timescale and my own estimation of the future of that business if I were putting my own capital into the business. I've not studied the business well. I don't have a strong point of view or opinion on the value of the business relative to its future earnings potential. That's how I would look at it. I would make an investment for the long term if I were to buy the shares, not look at the last year's numbers and say that there's a valuation arbitrage opportunity and that's what I'm buying.</p>
</details>

**Friedberg:** 各人有各人的看法，随着时间的推移，市场会自我修正，正如他们所说。今天是一个投票问题，未来是一个衡量问题。这是沃伦·巴菲特的名言，未来的实际盈利能力将决定某人是支付了高价还是低价，这取决于他们过去买入的时间点，这意味着在4000亿美元的市值下，你可能捡了个便宜，也可能严重超付了。这将基于你作为投资者的评估和判断。

<p class="english-text">To each their own, over time, the market corrects itself as they say. It's a voting matter today and it's a weighing matter in the future. That's Warren Buffett's famous quote that the actual earnings generation in the future will determine whether someone paid a good price or a bad price, depending on the point at which they bought in the past, meaning at 400 billion market cap, you could be getting a steal, or you could be significantly overpaying. That's going to be based on your assessment, your judgment as an investor.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 我认为人们正在关注30%到45%的同比增长，Chamath，并说，是的，它需要大量的……要填补这个估值，我们需要大量的增长。也许增长会加速。我们在英伟达身上看到了这一点，对吧？它们开始出现前所未有的增长。Chamath，在我们进入下一个话题之前，你对Palantir的空头头寸有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think people are looking at like 30 to 45% year over year growth, Chamath, and saying, yeah, it's got a lot of... To fill in that valuation, we just take a lot of growth. Maybe the growth accelerates. We saw that with Nvidia, right? They started to have unprecedented growth. Any thoughts on Palantir short while we move on to our next subject, Chamath?</p>
</details>

**Chamath:** 嗯，我认为Palantir的空头头寸很愚蠢。我认为那些人会亏钱。所有其他公司的情况，把你的图表放上去。那些做空这家公司的人不明白的是，你列出的所有其他业务，都有某种可行的竞争对手，你可以转而使用。所以我想说的是与他们相反的观点，即当客户流失风险较高时，市销率较低。所以看看市销率最低的那个，MongoDB。MongoDB所做的事情有90个版本。我不会说MongoDB是好是坏。那实际上是一家好公司。它是一家管理得非常好的企业。但它并不独特，只是管理得非常好。Snowflake并不独特，但它管理得很好。Palantir既独特又管理得很好。而且没有明确的替代品，所以没有地方可以转投。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think the Palantir short is stupid. And I think that those people will lose money. The thing with all of these other companies, put your chart up there. The thing that the people that are shorting this company don't understand is that all of these other businesses that you put up there, there is a viable competitor of some kind that you can switch to. And so what I would say is the opposite of what they're saying, which is you have a low multiple to sales when the churn risk is higher. So look at the one with the lowest multiple to sales, MongoDB. There's 90 versions of what MongoDB does. I'm not going to say whether MongoDB is good or bad. That's actually a good company. It's an extremely well run business. But it's not unique, it's just extremely well run. Snowflake is not unique, but it is well run. Palantir is both unique and well run. And there's no clear alternative, so there's no place to churn too.</p>
</details>

**Chamath:** 所以我认为它估值溢价的原因是，这些现金流的持续时间和持久性比你在任何其他公司通常看到的要长得多。如果人们花千分之一秒的时间真正动动脑筋，他们就会得出这个结论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I think the reason why it has a premium valuation is because the duration and the durability of these cash flows are much longer than what you typically see in any of these other companies. And if people took one one thousandth of a second to actually use their brain, they come to that conclusion.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 缺乏竞争对手是你认为它更具防御性的原因。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Lack of competitors would be the reason you think it's more defensible.</p>

**Chamath:** 顺便说一句，我既没有做多也没有做空。我在私募市场做多过。我是Series B轮的投资者。我现在不做多了。我希望我还在做多，但我没有，所以这并不是说我对它是否正确有既得利益。但很明显，他们所做的事情是完全独特和差异化的。市场上没有替代品。这就是为什么它们的市销率如此之高。如果你看看任何独特且实际上是他们所提供产品的唯一竞争对手的任何市场，你都会看到类似的这种市场动态。

<p class="english-text">By the way, I'm neither long nor short. I was long in the private markets. I was an investor in the series Be a Pound Tour. I'm not long anymore. I wish I was but I'm not so it's not like I have a vested interest in this being right But it's just so obvious that what they do is completely unique and completely differentiated. There is no alternative in the market for it That's why they trade such a huge premium to sales. And if you look at any market for any product that is unique and is effectively Where they are the only competitor for what they offer you will see an equivalent market dynamic like this.</p>

### 美国住房可负担性危机

**Jason:** 好了，听着，现在存在一场可负担性危机。我们过去几周在这里讨论过。上周末，特朗普政府提出了一个相当疯狂的想法，即50年抵押贷款，这表面上会削减每月还款20%到30%，也许会极大地促进房屋所有权。我们在这里深入讨论年轻人的这个想法。这个想法遭到了许多人的抨击，杂志说：“嘿，这是奴役。”它会使你一生中支付的利息增加三倍，你将终生为此付出巨大代价，你将成为一个**契约仆役**（Indentured servant: 一种历史上的劳务契约，服务期满后可获得自由）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, listen, there is an affordability crisis. We talked about it here for the last couple of weeks. Last weekend, the Trump administration floated a pretty wild idea of a 50-year mortgage that would ostensibly cut. payments monthly payments by twenty thirty percent and maybe the red x t boost home ownership and what will discuss this in depth here for young people the idea was slammed by many people in magazine hey this is that slavery. And it's gonna triple the lifetime interest you can just be paying for the nose for your entire life and you'll be in a dentured. servant,</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 《**政治家**》（Politico: 一家美国政治新闻机构）表示，这个想法是由**FHFA**（Federal Housing Finance Agency: 联邦住房金融局）局长**Bill Palti**（Bill Palti: 联邦住房金融局局长）提出的。Palti在推特上说，FHFA正在“积极评估**可携式抵押贷款**（Portable mortgages: 允许房主在出售现有房屋后，将其现有抵押贷款的利率和条款转移到新购房屋上的贷款）”。这是一个非常好的主意。这意味着如果你购买另一套房屋，如果你升级房屋，你可以带着你的抵押贷款。这显然会让人们摆脱那些可能已经住不下的房屋，或者孩子已经离开，有多余卧室的房屋，而这种情况没有发生，因为人们不愿意放弃2%或3%的抵押贷款去升级到6%或7%的抵押贷款。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Politico, said the idea was brought about by FHFA director Bill Palti. Palti tweeted that the FHFA was "actively evaluating portable mortgages." Now, this is a really good idea. That means you can take your mortgage with you if you go buy another home, if you upgrade a home, that would obviously get people out of homes that maybe they've outgrown or that their kids have left and there's extra bedrooms, and that is not happening because people are to unwind a two or three percent mortgage to upgrade it to a six or seven percent.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** **全国房地产经纪人协会**（National Association of Realtors: 美国最大的房地产行业协会）上周发布了一份报告，称首次购房者的平均年龄现在是40岁。这比我上大学的1991年的28岁有所上升。从1991年到2021年的30年间，它只适度增加了18%，从28岁到33岁。所以在过去的四年里，首次购房者的平均年龄从33岁跃升到40岁。一天后，播客的朋友**Ben Shapiro**（Ben Shapiro: 美国保守派政治评论员）的一段视频走红。这是25秒的视频，之后我们会讨论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there's been some data going viral on acts national association of real terms released a report last week the average age of a first time home buyer is now forty years old. That's up from twenty eight years old in nineteen ninety one when i was in college. And in the 30 years from 1991 to 2021, it only increased a modest 18% from 28 to 33 years old. So in the last four years, it's jumped from 33 years old to 40 years old for the average first time home buyer. Day later, clip of friend of the pod Ben Shapiro went viral. Here's the 25 second clip and we'll talk about it after.</p>
</details>

**Ben Shapiro:** 如果你是一个年轻人，你负担不起住在这里，那么也许你不应该住在这里。我的意思是，这是一个真实存在的问题。我知道我们现在成长在一个社会中，它告诉你你理应住在你成长的地方，但现实是，美国的历史几乎完全与此相反。美国的历史是，你去一个有机会的地方。如果这里的机会有限，而且它们没有改变，那么你真的应该尝试考虑其他有更好机会的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you're a young person and you can't afford to live here, then maybe you should not live here. I mean, that is a real thing. I know that we've now grown up in a society that says that you deserve to live where you grew up, but the reality is that the history of America is almost literally the opposite of that. The history of America is you go to a place where there is opportunity. And if the opportunities are limited here and they're not changing, then you really should try to think about other places where you have better opportunities.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** Ben Shapiro的说法非常明显。Chamath，你对可负担性有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Pretty obvious statement there from Ben Shapiro. Your thoughts generally on affordability, Chema?</p>
</details>

**Chamath:** 这是一个真正的问题。我认为这是共和党赢得中期选举必须正确处理的关键议题。我认为有三个关键问题，如果我必须指出的话。第一个问题是住房。所以Ben说得对。具体来说，问题在于老年人拥有所有房屋并拥有多套房屋，而年轻人根本无法进入住房市场。城市和州在激励新房建设方面做得不好。这是一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a real problem. I think that this is... the keystone topic that has to be navigated correctly for the Republicans to win the midterms. I think there are three critical issues if I had to sort of put my finger on it. Issue number one is one of housing. So Ben is right there. Specifically, the problem is that Older folks own all the homes and own multiple homes and younger folks just cannot get into the housing market. And cities and states do not do a good job of creating incentives for new homes to be built. That's one.</p>
</details>

**Chamath:** 第二个，我认为仍然是医疗保健。关于**奥巴马医改**（Obamacare: 美国《平价医疗法案》的俗称）成本的最新数据非常糟糕。奥巴马医改是一个彻底的失败。限制毛利率的概念，虽然理论上看起来不错，但实际上被证明是一个极其愚蠢的做法。所以这意味着，Jason，奥巴马医改中有一个规定，说你只能赚取15%的毛利率，对吧？当时白宫的人认为成本会下降，因为毛利率会受到限制。相反，他们所做的是开始提高所有东西的总价格，这样15%就适用于一个更大的数字。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second, I think, is still around healthcare. The emergent data on the cost of Obamacare is horrible. Obamacare has been an unmitigated failure. The concept of capping gross margin, while it seemed good theoretically, has really turned out to be an incredibly stupid thing. So what that meant, Jason, is in Obamacare, there was this feature that said you can only make a 15% gross margin, right? And what the folks at the White House at the time thought would happen is that cost would go down because their gross margin would be limited. Instead, what they did was they just started to raise the gross prices of everything so that the 15% applied to a much bigger number.</p>
</details>

**Chamath:** 所以你看到本周总统试图看看他是否可以直接将医疗保健激励措施直接提供给人们，并将其存入他们的**HSA账户**（Health Savings Account: 健康储蓄账户，一种税收优惠的储蓄账户，用于支付医疗费用），这样就不需要通过医疗保健基础设施和保险公司。所以这需要解决。然后第三个是学生债务方面。我上周说过，这周我再说一次。我有点模仿Peter Thiel，但他一直说我们必须对贷款减免更加同情。我认为他是对的。所以我认为如果我们解决了这三个问题，住房方面的一些问题，医疗保健方面的一些问题，以及学生贷款方面的一些问题，这将是一个变革性的国内政策议程，将可负担性置于核心位置，这将影响5000万到7500万美国家庭。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so you saw the president this week trying to see if he could just take the health incentives and give them directly to people and put it in their HSA accounts so that it didn't need to flow through the healthcare infrastructure and the insurance companies. So that needs to get fixed. And then the third is on the student debt side. I said it last week, I'll say this week. I'm sort of copying Peter Thiel here, but He's been saying for a while that we have to be much more sympathetic to the loan forgiveness. And I think he's right. So I think if we get these three issues addressed, something in housing, something in healthcare, and something on the student loan side, it is a transformational domestic policy agenda that puts affordability front and center, that will impact 50 to 75 million American households.</p>

**Friedberg:** Friedberg，你的看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- Freberg, your thoughts?</p>
</details>

**Friedberg:** 如果你拿出昨天这篇文章，洛杉矶市议会昨天举行了一次投票，投票结果是12比2。在这次投票中，他们限制了房东每年可以提高租金的金额。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you pull up this article from yesterday, yesterday, LA city council held a vote, the vote was 12 to two. In this vote, they limited the amount that a landlord can increase the rent every year.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 这是租金稳定化吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- This is rent stabilization?</p>
</details>

**Friedberg:** 是的，租金管制。所以它限制了房东可以收取的租金。基本上，他们以12比2的票数通过了投票。他们投票决定房东每年增加租金的幅度不得超过**CPI**（Consumer Price Index: 消费者物价指数，衡量商品和服务价格变化的指标）的90%。CPI是由联邦机构每年发布的消费者物价指数，正如我们所知，它是我们节目中经常讨论的通货膨胀指数。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, rent control. So it limits what a landlord can charge in rent. And basically they passed the vote 12 to two. And what they voted is that the landlord cannot increase the rent on an annual basis by more than 90% of CPI. CPI is the consumer price index, which is published by a federal agency every year. As we know, it's the inflation index number that we often talk about on the show.</p>
</details>

**Friedberg:** 设有一个1%的下限，所以无论CPI如何，房东都可以将租金提高1%，上限为4%。所以如果CPI因某种原因飙升（我认为最近没有发生过），你最多可以收取4%的增幅。所以它限制了房东可以收取的租金。从根本上说，作为投资者来思考这个问题。所以如果你购买一栋建筑或建造一栋新建筑，你的股权现在将被封顶。你的上涨空间，即你可以从该资产（你购买的公寓楼）产生的现金流金额，现在受到每年增加租金金额的限制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">with a floor of 1%, so the landlord, regardless of CPI, can increase rent by 1%, and a cap of 4%. So if CPI spikes for some reason, which I don't think has happened in recent times, you can charge up to 4% increase. So it limits what a landlord can charge in rent. And fundamentally, to think about this as an investor. So if you're buying a building or building a new building, you are now going to have your equity cap. Your upside, the amount of cash flows that you can generate from that asset, meaning the apartment building you're buying, is now limited. buy the amount that you can increase the rent every year.</p>
</details>

**Friedberg:** 所以这会降低资本对投资者购买新建筑、投入资金升级建筑或投入资金建造新建筑的积极性。与此同时，正如我们所知，洛杉矶市、加利福尼亚州和美国联邦政府已经通过了一项又一项法律、一项又一项法规、一项又一项法令，使得建造住房变得更昂贵、耗时更长、更困难。法规的增加与经济上自由市场准入的限制相结合，我认为使得资本自由流动去建造新住房和开发供人们居住和出售的单元变得越来越困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that creates a disincentive for capital for investors to buy new buildings or put money into upgrading buildings or put money into building new buildings. At the same time as we know the city of Los Angeles the state of California. And. the federal government of the United States have passed law after law, regulation after regulation, statute after statute has gone into effect that makes it more expensive, take more time, and more difficult to build housing. The increase in regulation combined with the cap in the economic access to free markets, I think has made it increasingly difficult for there to be a free flow of capital to go and build new housing and develop units for people to live in and for sale.</p>
</details>

**Friedberg:** 每当政府介入市场，它就会扭曲市场。它限制了流动性，也限制了市场找到更低价格。我认为这从根本上解释了所发生的一切。政府现在正试图以如此戏剧性的方式限制房东可以收取的租金，以至于它完全剥夺了房东购买和拥有这些建筑的动力，因为它们现在只会是低收益的投资，没有上涨空间。所以没有动力去建造新住房。然后政府又出于各种原因使得建造新住房变得困难重重。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Every time the government gets involved in a market, it distorts the market. It limits the flow of liquidity and it limits the market finding lower prices. And I think that's fundamentally what's gone on. The government is now trying to limit what a landlord can charge in such a dramatic way that it's ripped out all of the incentive for landlords to buy and own these buildings because they're now only going to be small yielding. be small yielding. investments and there's no upside. So there's no incentive to go and build new housing. And then the government's made it difficult to build new housing for lots and lots of different reasons.</p>
</details>

**Friedberg:** 同样的事情也发生在**13号提案**（Prop 13: 加利福尼亚州1978年通过的财产税改革法案）上，我认为该法案于1978年在加利福尼亚州通过，它极大地抑制了人们出售房屋的积极性，并降低了市场的流动性。现在，我将转向联邦机构。**房利美**（Fannie Mae: 美国联邦国民抵押贷款协会）和**房地美**（Freddie Mac: 联邦住房抵押贷款公司）合计发行或支持了约8万亿美元的住房贷款。最初的看法是，这太棒了。它们为缺乏流动性的市场，为需要资金的人，为没有资产可贷的银行创造了流动性。因此，这将使更多人更容易获得住房。这是建立政府贷款机构以支持住房购买的根本前提。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Same thing happened with Prop 13, which we passed in California in 1978, I think, which creates a huge disincentive for people to sell their homes and reduces liquidity in the market. Now, I'll just flip to the federal agencies. So Fannie and Freddie combined have issued or supported about $8 trillion of home loans. The initial view on that would be, okay, great. They're creating liquidity for a market that doesn't have liquidity for people that need access to capital for banks that don't have assets to lend. And as a result, it's going to make housing more accessible to more people. That was the fundamental premise of setting up a government lending agency to support the purchase of housing.</p>
</details>

**Friedberg:** 但当你快进多年后，在今天我们拥有的一个流动性强、资本充足的市场中，根本的现实是，这些资本实际上是过剩的流动性，它实际上会推高价格。就像我们在许多其他市场中看到的那样，比如教育领域的学生贷款，或者医疗保健领域的医疗保险、医疗补助、奥巴马医改等等。当政府介入并提供资本以支持市场并使其更容易获得时，价格就会飙升。所以人们会使用房利美或房地美的贷款购买第一套房，然后他们可以购买第二套房或第三套房。或者他们现在可以负担得起购买他们原本可能买不起的更昂贵的房屋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But as you fast forward over many years, the fundamental reality in a very liquid, well-capitalized marketplace that we have today is that that capital is actually excess liquidity that can in fact drive prices up. And much like we've seen. in many other markets like education with student loans or like health care with medicare medicaid obama care and so on. When the government gets involved in provides capital to support a market and make it more accessible the prices skyrocket.</p>
</details>

**Friedberg:** 随着时间的推移，这会在市场中产生通货膨胀效应。我认为这是一个根本性的问题，即我们如何摆脱这个厄运循环？因为从根本上说，我们正在增加建造新房屋的限制，我们正在限制你在房屋上可以赚取的金额，我们正在向市场提供流动性以推高房屋价格，所有这些都造成了这场完美的灾难风暴，我们只是举手投降。你知道我们说什么吗？请政府做得更多。如果政府做得更多，我可以告诉你一件事是肯定的：价格还会上涨更多。所以我认为最具有挑战性和最困难的事情之一是说：“嘿，政府少做点，想办法摆脱这种局面。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So people will use a Fannie or Freddie Mac loan to buy a first home and then they can go buy their second home or their third home. Or they can now afford to buy a more expensive home that they otherwise might not have bought. And so over time creates an inflationary effect in the markets. And I think that this is a fundamental question on like, how are we going to get out of this doom cycle? because fundamentally we're adding restrictions for building new homes, we're capping the amount you can make on homes, and we're giving liquidity to markets to drive up the price of homes, all of which create this perfect storm of disaster where we're just raising our hands. And you know what we say? Please, government, do more. And if the government does more, I can tell you one thing for sure. prices are going to go up even more. And so I think one of the challenging and hardest things to do is say, "Hey, government do less and figure out a way to kind of back out of this situation."</p>

**Jason:** 这完美地引出了我正在实地看到的情况。我住在纽约、洛杉矶、旧金山，现在大家都知道，我住在德克萨斯州奥斯汀。David，你完美地引出了这一点，这里真的有两个不同的国家。你有一些人住在沿海城市，那里不允许建造单元房，租金极其昂贵，但你赚的钱却一样多。如果你看看我小时候在布鲁克林长大，晚上上学，花了五年时间从福特汉姆大学拿到学位。我欠了1.2万美元的学生贷款。我在大学期间做IT，每年赚4万到6万美元。这在当时是一笔不小的薪水，但我在布鲁克林租的Huberg公寓每月500美元。我住在一间阁楼公寓里。

And if you, you're perfect segue there, David, there's really two different countries here. You have people living in coastal cities where you're not allowed to build units and rent is incredibly expensive and you make the same amount of money. If you look at when I grew up in Brooklyn and I went to school at night, I took five years to get my degree from Fordham University. I had 12K in student loan debt. I was making 40 to 60,000 a year while I was in college doing IT. It's a big salary for back then, but my apartment for Huberg in Brooklyn was 500 a month. I lived in an apartment, an addict apartment.</p>

**Jason:** 所以如果你今天在美国找两个这样的人，他们每年赚6万到7万美元。这是27岁受过大学教育的人的平均工资。如果你住在奥斯汀，你绝对可以轻松拥有自己的房子。让我告诉你，Bert，这有多容易。我们在德克萨斯州奥斯汀有太多的单元房，在休斯顿甚至更明显。但是Nick，把租金图表调出来，因为你显然是从租房者开始的。奥斯汀的租金在过去三年下降了20%，因为我们建造了单元房。当你建造单元房时，当你有了供应，价格就会下降。

We have so many units in Austin, Texas, and in Houston, it's even more pronounced. But Nick, pull up the chart there just on rent because you start as renters, obviously. Austin rent has gone down 20% in the last three years because we build units when you build units When you have supply prices go down.</p>

And you're gonna be able to make a down payment of 10% because the homes within 25 miles under 45 minutes of driving to the city center. Do you know how much they are per square foot, Friedberg?</p>

**Friedberg:** 我住的地方？多少钱？

<p class="english-text">Where I live? - How much?</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 它们每平方英尺200到300美元。你可以花30万到50万美元买一套三居室。Friedberg，你可以花50万美元买一套全新的。所以……Ben Shapiro绝对是正确的。那些对Ben Shapiro不满的人都是一群蠢货潮人，他们欠了几十万美元的债，每月支付五六千美元的租金，永远无法摆脱租金或他们那些文科废话学位的束缚。如果你是一个聪明人，去德克萨斯大学。

<p class="english-text">They are 200 to $300 per square foot. You can buy a three bedroom for 300,000 to 500,000. You can buy a brand new one, Friedberg, for 500,000. So... Ben Shapiro is absolutely correct. The people who are upset at Ben Shapiro are a bunch of dipshit hipsters who went hundreds of thousand dollars in debt, are paying five or $6,000 a month in their rent, can never get out from under their rent payment or their liberal arts bullshit degree. If you're a smart person, go to the University of Texas.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 毕业时几乎没有债务，住在一间普通的公寓里，付一笔首付，然后买一套50万美元的房子。这个问题在德克萨斯州不存在。在很多市场也不存在。昨晚，Jason，在晚餐时，总统问：“我们能做些什么？关于学生债务有什么想法？”**Bill Ackman**（Bill Ackman: 潘兴广场资本管理公司创始人）有一个很棒的想法，那就是：“我们需要让大学承担起责任，作为第一损失方。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">graduate with little to no debt, live in a modest apartment, put down a down payment, and buy a $500,000 home. This problem doesn't exist in Texas. It doesn't exist in a lot of markets. Last night, at dinner, Jason, the president asked, "What could we do? What are some ideas around student debt?" And Bill Ackman had a great idea, which was, "We need to put the university in place." on the hook as the first loss.</p>
</details>

**Chamath:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- Yes.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 他的建议是2万美元。我不知道这个数字是否正确。但他提出的逻辑，我认为很有道理，那就是，如果大学被迫为这些学位提供担保，并且知道它们将承担一定金额（2万、3万、4万美元）的第一笔损失，它们就会更加谨慎地对待强加给人们的学位，以及它们愿意通过这些贷款实际担保的金额，这将是一个明显的迹象，表明许多这些学位毫无意义。而现在我们没有市场检查来告诉年轻人这一点，所以我们把他们都推向学校，认为这是正确的做法，然后他们就完全背负了债务，永远无法翻身。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- And his suggestion was 20,000 was what he said. I don't know if that's the right number or not. But the logic that he made, which I thought made a lot of sense was, if the universities are forced to underwrite these degrees and they know that they'll take the first dollar loss up to a certain amount, 20, 30, 40,000, they'll be much more circumspect about what degrees force onto people and the amount of money that they're willing to actually underwrite via these loans and that will be a telltale sign that a lot of these degrees don't make any sense. And right now we don't have a market check to tell young people that and so we push them all into school thinking that it's the right thing to do and then they're just completely saddled and they'll never get up.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 你必须学习数学，你必须有自主权，你必须自力更生。我上学的时候，有些孩子，现在也一样，他们认为自己必须住在校园里。他们认为自己必须上四年大学。如果你有一份工作，你花五年时间拿到学位，并且不住在校园里，你毕业时的债务状况会大不相同。如果你有一份有需求的工作，你每年能赚6万、7万、8万美元。如果你毕业时债务较少，如果你住在一间阁楼公寓里，如果你稍微节俭一点，并且制作一份财务电子表格，我不得不这样做，因为我爸爸是调酒师，我妈妈是护士，我必须自己支付大学费用。我必须仔细考虑。

### H-1B签证改革的辩论

**Jason:** 我想与可负担性焦虑相关的是H-1B签证问题的再次爆发。在福克斯新闻上，**Laura Ingraham**（Laura Ingraham: 福克斯新闻主持人）对特朗普总统施加了很大压力，特朗普总统坚守立场，认为美国需要高技能工人。这是25秒的视频片段，之后我们再回来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I guess related to the angst about affordability was the flare-up of H1B's again Trump went viral after Laura Ingraham on Fox kind of pushed him pretty hard on H-1B visas, and he stood his ground, President Trump stood his ground, that we need high-skilled workers in America. Here's your 25-second clip. We'll be back on the other side.</p>
</details>

**Laura Ingraham:** H-1B签证问题对你的政府来说不会是一个重要的优先事项，因为如果你想提高美国工人的工资，你就不能让成千上万的外国工人涌入这个国家。

<details>

<p class="english-text">H1B visa thing will not be a big priority for your administration because if you want to raise wages for American workers You can't flood the country with with tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of foreign workers.</p>

</details>

**Laura Ingraham:** 我们以前是怎么做到的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- How do we ever do it before?</p>
</details>

**Jason:** Chamath，你对此有什么看法？我们显然已经对**H-1B签证**（H-1B Visa: 美国非移民工作签证，允许美国雇主临时雇佣外国专业技术人员）的价值和滥用问题谈了很多，但它又出现了。我想，你知道，在特朗普支持率有点低，人们正受通货膨胀困扰，通货膨胀没有下降等等的时候，这似乎又是一个争论点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jamal, your thoughts here? We've obviously talked to a blue in the face about the value and the abuse of H1B visas, but it's coming up again. And I guess. You know at a time when Trump's popularity is a little bit low and people are Suffering with the inflation not going down yada. Yada. This seems to be like Another point of contention.</p>
</details>

**Chamath:** 我认为我们必须彻底改革H-1B项目。昨晚在晚餐时，**Howard Lutnick**（Howard Lutnick: 华尔街金融家，Cantor Fitzgerald首席执行官）解释了这些滥用行为是如何发生的。它的运作方式实际上非常不公平。他描述的是，当H-1B签证的申请窗口开放时，一家在海外拥有30万员工的公司，会代表所有30万员工提出申请，因为他们大致属于同一种员工，谁获得签证谁就可以过来。现在，如果你提交30万份申请，显然你比Friedberg的公司、我的公司或Jason的公司（只提交一份申请）有不成比例的更大机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that we have to overhaul the h1b program last night at dinner actually Howard Lutnick explained how some of these abuses happen. It's really unfair actually how it works What he described is that when the application window opens for what is a very small number of H1Bs, a company that has, you know, call it 300,000 employees abroad, will apply on behalf of all 300,000 because they're all roughly the same kind of employee, whoever gets it gets to come over. Now, if you're filing 300,000 applications, obviously you have a disproportionately larger chance than Freeberg's company or my company or your company, Jason, who's filing one.</p>
</details>

**Chamath:** 显然。所以当发生这种事情，并且你现在可以使用数据来理解它时，你必须解决它。所以这是一个非常重要且明显的改变，我们需要立即进行，那就是我们必须允许美国公司找到这些人，并使其非常精确。第二件事是，我们正在引入一个价格，每家公司都可以支付，这样你就可以清楚地表明那个人可以创造的不成比例的经济价值，以及在尽一切努力之后，你仍然无法在这里找到那个人。这就是为什么你愿意支付10万美元，这是一个不小的数目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">obviously. And so when those kinds of things happen and you can now use the data to understand it, you have to fix it. So that's one very material and obvious change we need to make right away, which is we have to allow American companies to find these folks and have it be very precise. The second thing is that we're introducing a price that each of these companies can pay for so that then you can signal clearly the disproportionate economic value that that person can create and the fact that after all the effort possible you can't find that person here. And that's why you're willing to pay $100,000, which is a non-trivial amount of money.</p>
</details>

**Chamath:** 所以我认为当这两件事都发生时，即引入10万美元的费用和解决签证申请滥用问题，我认为我们将在清理H-1B问题方面迈出一大步，并使我们处于一个更好的位置。但现在存在很多滥用行为。所以这个项目本身并没有按照它应该的方式运作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think that when both of those two things, the $100,000 thing is introduced and the visa application abuse is fixed, I think that we will go a long way to cleaning up the H-1B thing and putting ourselves back in a much better place. But right now there's just a lot of abuse. And so the program itself is not working the way it should have.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 我认为这在很大程度上已经解决了。我认为这对特朗普政府来说是一个沟通问题，因为他们确实对它征收了10万美元的费用。这已经生效了。我在这里的CNBC一直说，我们已经启动了十年。下半部分存在大规模滥用，上半部分是必要的。如果你引进年薪4万到8万美元的IT人员，再加收2万、3万、4万美元的费用是不可行的。但如果你是谷歌或Facebook，你引进一位将获得100万美元报酬的人工智能博士，那么那10万美元的费用，每年2万、3万美元，无论最终是多少，都微不足道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think this has largely been solved. I think it's a communication issue for the Trump administration because they did put this $100,000 fee on it. That's already in effect. And I've been saying this here at CNBC, this we had started up for a decade. There's massive abuse on the bottom half and it's necessary on the top half. If you're bringing in IT people for 40 to $80,000, it's not viable to put a 20, 30, $40,000 fee on top of that. But if you're Google or Facebook and you're bringing in a PhD, an AI who's going to get paid a million dollars, well, that $100,000 fee, 20, $30,000 a year, whatever it winds up being, is nothing. It's de minimis.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** Friedberg，我再进一步。我认为我们应该拍卖这些……用一个更狭窄的例子。假设Friedberg。他是一家初创公司。他有资金，但他必须回报。Friedberg，你愿意为那个你找不到的合适人选支付10万美元吗？现在有没有你觉得“天哪，我找不到高度专业化的人”的工作？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I take it one step further, Freebird. I think we should be auctioning these- Using a more narrow example. Let's say Freebird. It's a startup. He has capital, but he has to return it. Freeberg, would you pay $100,000 for the right person that you could not find? And are there jobs where right now you're like, man, I can't find people that are highly specialized or not yet?</p>
</details>

**Friedberg:** 我能理解。是的。我的意思是，我当然能理解。我的意思是，不幸的是，在我的行业里，我们可以招募到这类人。在我的行业里，因为我们非常特殊，但是，是的，我能理解，特别是涉及到软件，我能看到人们肯定会这样做。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I could see that. Yeah. I mean, certainly I could see being I mean, unfortunately, I have there are we can recruit those sorts of people in my industry. in my industry. because we're very special, but yeah, I can understand, like particularly as it relates to software, I could see people definitely doing that.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 是的，真正做到这一点的方法，也是特朗普的超能力，就是把一个成本中心变成一个利润中心。他做了一些出色的事情，我总是会赞扬他。而最出色的事情就是把这10万美元变成一场拍卖。我会把其中一半拍卖给出价最高的人。然后谷歌、Facebook和Meta就会说，他们不是以标准价格给我10万个，而是会说：“嘿，我需要10个。我肯定会出价100万。我还需要100个。我愿意出价75万。”然后把这笔钱用于职业培训或再培训。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And the way to really do this, and this is Trump's superpowers, turning something that's a cost center into a profit center. I always give him credit when he does something brilliant. And the brilliant thing to do is to take the 100,000 and make it an auction. I would auction off half of these to the highest bidder. And then you would have Google, Facebook, and Meta saying, instead of give me 100,000 of these at the rack rate, they would be saying, "Hey, I need 10 of these. For sure, I'm going to bid a million. I need another 100 of these. I'm willing to bid 750." And then take that money and just allocate it to vocational training or retraining.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 你知道，问题是这届政府有两面。一方面是这届政府中我非常钦佩的杰出人才，比如Lutnick和Sacks以及商界人士。另一方面，在我看来，是那些笨蛋，那些做**ICE**（Immigration and Customs Enforcement: 美国移民及海关执法局）特工和遣返工作的人。H-1B签证问题就是这方面的完美例子。他们去了现代汽车工厂，那里需要高技能工人，他们逮捕并遣返了一群韩国人。他们以一种非常残酷、非常不尊重的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, the problem is this administration has two different sides. You have the brilliant people in this administration who I admire very much, like Lutnik and Sachs and the business people. And then you have the knuckleheads in my mind, the people who are doing the stuff that ICE agents and the deportations. And the perfect example of this has come up with the H-1B visas. They took the Hyundai plant where you needed high skilled workers and they arrested and they deported a bunch of South Koreans. They in a very brutal way, very disrespectful way.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 与此同时，Lutnick正在努力争取人们投资这个国家并在这里建厂。你不能一边用**Stephen Miller**（Stephen Miller: 特朗普政府前高级顾问，以强硬移民政策著称）那种疯狂的方式追捕和不人道地对待人们，一边又说：“嘿，我们希望你投资并建造电池工厂。”现代汽车有一个电池工厂。这些疯子跑到那里逮捕并用链条锁住了韩国人，他们是我们的伙伴，正在帮助我们重建海军。这就是政府必须用一个声音说话的地方，而且必须是专业、聪明的人。这又是另一个例子。他们已经解决了这个问题，但他们无法正确地沟通。让最好的事情发生，并一遍又一遍地沟通。现在它是一个利润中心。不要逮捕那些试图在这里建厂的韩国人。

<p class="english-text">At the same time that Lutnick is out there trying to get people to invest in the country and build factories here.

These lunatics came there and arrested and chained up South Koreans who are our partners who are helping us rebuild our Navy. This is where the administration has to speak with one voice and it needs to be the professional smart people. And this is another example of it. They already solved this problem and they can't. Communicate it properly. Let best thing go out there and communicate this over and over and over again. It's a profit center now. And don't arrest the South Koreans who were trying to get to build factories here.</p>

### 太阳风暴与地磁事件

**Jason:** 下一个话题。本周发生了三次大规模的**日冕物质抛射**（CME: Coronal Mass Ejection: 太阳向太空抛射大量等离子体和磁场）。这些是巨大的带电粒子波，主要是质子和电子，从太阳喷射出来。你可以在这里看到一个图示。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Next topic. There was a massive three three massive coronal mass ejections this week. These are giant. giant waves of charged particles, protons and electrons mostly, that shot off from the sun. You can see a graphic here.</p>

**Chamath:** 你必须选择更好的词。因为那现在看起来像天王星。你相信吗？

<p class="english-text">- You have to pick better words. 'Cause that looks like Uranus right now. Did you ever believe it?</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 不，大规模抛射直接从天王星喷出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- No, mass ejections shot out right from Uranus.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 好的，太阳会经历一个11年的周期。正如你所知，太阳是一个巨大的等离子球。等离子体中的粒子非常热，能量非常高，以至于电子、质子和所有粒子都分裂开来，所以你有这些亚原子粒子以极高的能量水平四处移动。当质子相互碰撞时，那就是核聚变，那就是我们从太阳获得能量的原因。因为这些是带电粒子，质子带正电，电子带负电，当它们以如此高的能量在如此密集的空间中移动时，它们实际上会产生非常强大的磁场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, so the sun goes through an 11 year cycle. As you know, the sun is a giant ball of plasma. plasma is where the particles are so hot, they're so energetic that the electrons and the protons and all the particles kind of split apart and so you have these subatomic particles moving around at extremely high energy levels and when the protons smash into each other that's what fusion is and that's what causes the energy that we get from the Sun. And because these are charged particles, protons have a positive charge and electrons have a negative charge, when they're moving around at this high energy in such a dense space, they actually create very powerful magnetic fields.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 那些磁场会拉伸和扭曲太阳表面的物理结构。随着时间的推移，磁场强度会变得如此之强，以至于偶尔会断裂。并将一部分粒子射入太空。这就是驱动日冕物质抛射（这些巨大的带电粒子波）的基本物理原理。它们以每秒数千英里的速度飞过太空。高能带电粒子波。然后当它们撞击地球时，因为它们是带电粒子，而地球周围有磁场，它们会与磁场相互作用并扰乱它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And those magnetic fields pull and stretch the physics of the surface of the Sun. and overtime there the cycles where those magnetic field strengths get so strong that once in a while they snap. And shoot out a chunk of those particles into space. That is the fundamental physics that drives the coronal mass ejections these big waves of charged particles. that shoot flying through space at thousands of miles a second is how fast they move. High energy waves of charged particles. And then when they hit the Earth, because they're charged particles and we have a magnetic field around the Earth, they interact with the magnetic field and they disturb it.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 地球磁场的扰动实际上可能对GPS、通信产生巨大影响，它实际上可能在地球表面的导电材料中造成短路。所以多年来，我们一直在谈论，如果有一天发生一次如此大规模的日冕物质抛射，可能会发生灭绝级事件，它可能会摧毁卫星通信，关闭所有计算机，导致全球电网短路，存在所有这些重大风险。所以这经常被谈论为：“这个大事件什么时候会发生？”而本周，这是一个非常大的事件。连续发生了三次主要的日冕物质抛射。其中两次结合在一起同时撞击地球。我们经历了有记录以来最高级别的**地磁暴**（Geomagnetic storm: 太阳活动引起地球磁场剧烈扰动），即G5级别。

<p class="english-text">And the disturbance of the magnetic field on Earth can actually have dramatic effects on GPS, on communications, and it can actually create shorts. in conducting material on the surface of the planet. So for years, we've always talked about there could be an extinction level event one day if one of these coronal mass ejections are so large, they could actually wipe out satellite communication, they could turn off all computers, they could cause shorts in the electrical grids around the planet, there's all these major risks. So this is often talked about as like, when's this big event going to happen? And this week, it was a very big event. There were three major coronal mass ejections that happened in a row. Two of them kind of combined and hit the earth at the same time. And we had the highest level recorded geomagnetic storm, which was G5.</p>

**Jason:** 所以这次G5风暴对地球磁场强度造成了大规模扰动。幸运的是，没有报告大量损害，但我们确实在美国南部德克萨斯州看到了美丽的极光，因为这些带电粒子与磁场一起，它们会向南北两极移动，然后与大气中的分子结合，释放出光，你可以看到这些美丽的橙色、黄色、红色、绿色、紫色光波，看起来像是从天堂降临到地球上。这真是一个令人惊叹和壮观的景象。所以从太阳风暴的角度来看，这是可怕的一周，但它在地球上创造了美丽的景象。

<p class="english-text">So this G5 storm caused massive disruptions in the magnetic field strength of the earth. Fortunately, there was not a lot of reported damage, but we did get to enjoy the beautiful aurora as far south as Texas in the United States because these charged particles with magnetic field, they kind of move towards the north and south pole and then they combine with molecules in the atmosphere, they release light, and you can see these beautiful waves of orange, yellow, red, green, purple lights that look like they're coming down from the heavens all over the planet. It was really an amazing and spectacular sight.</p>

**Jason:** 所以这就是本周地磁暴的解释。但要明确的是……

<p class="english-text">So it was a scary week from a solar storm perspective, but it created a beautiful view here on Earth. So that was the explanation for what happened with the geomagnetic storm this week. But to be clear...</p>

**Jason:** 到目前为止，有一些报告称非洲的小型网络和其他地方的通信中断。我没有听说大规模的卫星故障，这显然总是这些事件的一个巨大风险，因为这些东西实际上可以使卫星短路。我的意思是，这些是……

**Jason:** 质子非常密集地移动，实际上，Nick，你能把这张图表调出来吗？这是一张值得一看的图表。所以这张图表实际上以对数刻度显示，这意味着图表上的每一步都比前一个数字大十倍。但你可以看到，在11月12日伦敦时间午夜左右，顺便说一句，那正是我从日本飞往旧金山之前，所以当时我实际上正在考虑不乘坐我的航班。

**Chamath:** 真的吗？

**Chamath:** 嗯，他不想在航班上发生大规模抛射，Jamal。那会很糟糕。

**Jason:** 嗯，你以为GPS会失灵之类的吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- Well, you thought like the GPS could go out or something?</p>
</details>

**Chamath:** 不，不，这以前发生过，他们确实有GPS失灵的冗余措施，但辐射水平会飙升。当你飞得那么高时，但只在高纬度地区。我当时正在查看我的飞行路径的纬度，但他们实际上关闭了所有飞越北极的航班，因为辐射变得非常高。当发生如此大的磁通量时，特别是在北纬地区，你不能飞越北极。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- No, no, so this has happened in the past and that they do have redundancy for the GPS going out, but the radiation level spikes. when you're that high up, but only at higher latitudes. I was looking at the latitude of my flight path, but they actually turned off all flights going over the North Pole because the radiation gets so high. You can't fly over the North Pole when you have this much magnetic flux happening, particularly in the Northern latitude.</p>
</details>

**Chamath:** 你可以在这张图片中看到，那个红色条代表能量大于10兆电子伏特的质子，这不是一个超高能量，但更可怕的是绿色条。绿色条实际上是100兆电子伏特。这是质子中巨大的能量，可能造成严重的微观损伤。例如，它可以撕裂DNA，撕裂电路等等。所以这是一组非常强大的带正电的质子。他们计算这些卫星上的探测器从太阳接收到的质子数量，以及它们撞击地球的数量。

<details>

<p class="english-text">You can see in this image that red bar is protons. that are moving that have an energy greater than 10 mega electron volts, which is not a super high energy, but more scarily is the green one. The green one is actually 100 mega electron volts. This is a massive amount of energy in a proton that can cause serious damage. damage on a microscopic level. So it can shred DNA, for example, it can shred circuits and so on. So this is a very powerful set of positively charged protons. And they count how many they're picking up on these satellites where they have these kind of detectors as they come from the sun, how many of them they're hitting.</p>
</details>

**Chamath:** 你可以看到这个惊人的峰值，它从通常的1个飙升到1000个。所以它在五分钟内飙升了1000倍。所以这是带电质子以极高的能量在太空中射向地球的自然背景效应的大规模增加。

<p class="english-text">And you can see this extraordinary spike where it's spiked up from Normally you see call it one. to all the way up to a thousand. So it's spiked by a thousand X in five minutes. And so this is a massive increase in the natural background effect of charged protons shooting at this extremely high energy space and hitting earth.</p>

**Jason:** 曾发生过**卡林顿事件**（Carrington Event: 1859年发生的一次强烈地磁暴，导致全球电报系统瘫痪），这是有记录以来最大的一次。Friedberg，我相信你对此有所了解，就像19世纪那样。考虑到今天的基础设施，如果发生那种级别的事件会怎样？因为那时我们有电报，对吧？我们没有很多设备，但其中一些设备在卡林顿事件中被烧毁了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There was that Carrington event, which was the largest one ever recorded. I'm sure you're aware of Friedberg like in the 1800s. What would happen if we had that level of event today given the infrastructure? Because back then we had telegrams, right? We didn't have a lot of equipment, but some of that equipment got fried during the Carrington event.</p>
</details>

**Friedberg:** 是的。我的意思是，那种事件绝对可以使电子设备短路，无论是卫星中的设备，然后它们将永久无法使用。如果它撞击地球表面，因为它会……记住保护地球的是我们拥有的磁场。我们地球周围有磁场的原因是地球有一个铁核。当这个铁核旋转时，它会产生一个磁场，我们非常幸运拥有它，因为那个磁场实际上就像一个盾牌。它就像地球周围的一个力场，它将带电粒子从地球上射开，阻止它们撞击地球表面，否则随着时间的推移会杀死地球上的所有生命。这就是为什么我们不能在没有保护的情况下生活在月球表面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean, that's the sort of event that can absolutely short circuit electronic equipment either in satellites, and then they would be rendered permanently unusable. It can also if it hits the surface of the earth because remember what protects the earth is the magnetic field we have And the reason we have a magnetic field around the earth is because we have an iron core at the earth And as that iron core rotates it creates a magnetic field and we're very lucky to have that because that magnetic field Actually, it's like a shield It's like a force field around the earth and it shoots charged particles away from the earth and keeps them from hitting the surface of the earth Which would kill all life on earth over time? That's why we can't go live on the surface of the moon without protection.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 我们正在为卡林顿事件做准备。如果它发生了，它可能会关闭所有设备，比如电网之类的。所以会发生的是，你可能会有这些电压尖峰，它们实际上可以使微芯片、小导线连接器短路，物理上破坏它们。所以这对文明来说是一个非常严重的风险，这就是为什么人们总是谈论这些太阳风暴是那些黑天鹅事件，那些百万年一遇的事件，或者那些百年一遇的事件，它们可能使我们回到石器时代，有些人说。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're preparing for a Carrington event. Like if it happened, you could turn off all the equipment, like power grids and stuff like that. So what would happen is you could have these voltage spikes that can actually short circuit, physically destructure the microchips, the little wire connectors. So this is a very serious risk to civilization, which is why people always talk about these solar storms being those black swan events, those one in a million year events, or those one in 100 year events that could render us back to the Stone Ages, some people say.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 这种可能性尚不清楚，但太阳确实会经历一个11年的周期。在这个11年的周期中，有一个最小值和一个最大值。我们现在接近最大值。所以我们每11年都会非常可预测地看到这些事件。但它们有多大，这是我们不知道的。我的意思是，我们试图研究太阳的动态，但我们很难非常准确地预测这些日冕物质抛射会有多大，何时发生。所以我们必须在它们发生时进行观察，但我们只有几个小时的时间说：“天哪，这东西要来了。注意。大家小心。注意安全。”但我们能做的准备工作不多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's unclear the probability of that, but the sun does go through an 11-year cycle. And during that 11-year cycle, there's a minimum and a maximum. We're kind of close to the maximum right now. So we are seeing these events very predictably every 11 years. But how big they are is something that's, you know, unknown to us. I mean, we try and study the dynamics of the sun, but it's very difficult for us to be very predictive about how big these CMEs are going to be when they're going to happen. So we have to be on top of like observing as they happen, but then we only have a few hours to say, "Oh my gosh, this thing's coming for us. Beware. Everyone watch out. Be careful." But there's not very much we can do to prepare.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 我要说，我有一个信念，我认为基于电子的计算将在本世纪末被淘汰，取而代之的是**光子计算**（Photon-based computing: 利用光子而非电子进行信息处理的计算方式）。我认为我们将把今天大部分使用铜和半导体材料的工作转移到光子材料和光子系统上，最终在本世纪某个时候可能是量子与光子系统相结合。当这种情况发生时，这些风险就会消失，但目前，当我们依赖电子并通过铜线等移动电子时，我们面临着这些地磁暴对地球和我们的核心基础设施产生不利影响的巨大风险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I will say, I have a belief that I think electron-based computing is going to go by the wayside by the end of the century and be replaced with photon-based computing. And I think we're gonna move most of what we do today with copper and semiconducting material over to photonic material and photonic systems and what will ultimately be quantum meets photonic systems probably some point this century. When that happens, these risks go away, but for now, while we're relying on electrons and moving electrons around through copper wire and so on, we run the very strong risk of these geomagnetic storms having an adverse effect on the planet and on our core infrastructure.</p>

### “大没收”与全球人才流动

**Jason:** Friedberg，我本周早些时候在东京见到了你。我们一起吃了一点天妇罗。美好的时光。是的。东京的美好时光。确实有很多来自科技行业的外国人正在前往东京。这是一个蓬勃发展的城市，科技场景蓬勃发展。有很多美国人得出了一个结论，那就是“大没收”即将到来。我称之为“大没收”。无论是加利福尼亚州还是纽约州，他们都在觊觎你的财富，所以人们现在正在寻找不止一个，而是两个逃生通道。

<p class="english-text">Freyberg, I got to see you earlier this week in Tokyo. We shared a little tempura. Good times. Yeah. Good times in Tokyo. Definitely a lot of expats making their way from the tech industry to Tokyo. It's a booming town, booming tech scene. There's a lot of people from America. who have come to the conclusion that the great confiscation is upon us. This is what I'm calling it, the great confiscation. Whether it's California or New York, they're coming for your bags, and so people are now looking for not one, but two escape hatches.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 一个州，一个主权州，Friedberg。在美国，我过去两年来自的伟大州德克萨斯州，人们正在寻找一个国际选择。每个人都在办理护照或**黄金签证**（Golden Visa: 通过投资获得他国居留权或公民身份的签证项目）。日本、利雅得，我过去两周都在那里，是首选之一。

**Jason:** 你看到我身后的这张图片了吗？这是马来西亚的那个森林城市。这是我见过的最疯狂的事情。你去了吗？我上周去了那里。他们投入了1000亿美元建造这个岛屿，一个完整的城市。这是Balaji拥有的东西吗？

**Chamath:** 不，他租了一家酒店。他们有一个大型度假酒店。他租下了整个酒店。他正在那里运营他的网络学校。他基本上是在运营一个面对面的**Y Combinator**（Y Combinator: 著名的创业孵化器）网络国家。你支付一笔费用，包括你的公寓、食物、健身房，你和其他想要成为新社会一部分的人一起玩，拥有自己的规则。从边缘来看很有趣。

<p class="english-text">No, he rented a hotel. They have a big resort hotel. He rented the whole hotel. That's where he's running his network school. He's running essentially like an in-person Y Combinator network state. You pay one fee for your apartment, your food, your gym, and you hang out with other people who want to be part of a new society. with their own rules. Kind of interesting on the margins.</p>
</details>

**Jason:** 但在这之间，以及新加坡和东京，我的意思是，有一群非常有趣的科技前沿人士，他们觉得美国不再是他们的归属，他们正在寻找那种“狂野西部”的感觉。我们能去哪里？我们能在哪里扎根？我们能为新时代建立一个新城镇吗？因为很多人认为美国正处于一个周期的末尾。看，今天它可能不是一个庞大的社区，但它是一个新兴的社区，一个不断壮大的社区。而且我认为这有一个非常有趣，也许是可怕的趋势线，就是人们希望在美国之外看到这些事情发生，并努力在其他地方扎根。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- But between that and Singapore and Tokyo, I mean, there was like a really interesting cross section of people that I would say are kind of on the frontier of tech. that feel like it's not in the United States anymore, and they're looking for what feels like the Wild West. Where can we go? Where can we put down roots? Where can we establish a new town for a new era? Because a lot of people view the US at the end of a cycle. And look, it may not be a massive community today, but it's a burgeoning community, it's a growing community. And there's this really, I think, interesting, maybe scary trend line. of folks wanting to kind of see this stuff happen outside the US and making an effort to put down roots elsewhere.</p>
