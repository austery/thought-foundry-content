title: CPI数据优于预期，推动标普500创下历史新高

### CPI 数据提振市场，标普500创历史新高

大家早上好，欢迎回到新一期的市场开盘直播。朋友们，盘前市场一片大好，而且是“非常”好。我们之所以“非常”好，是因为标普500指数刚刚触及了676点。我们谈论的是在盘前就创下历史新高的那种“好”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. Folks, we are green in the pre-markets and uh we're really green. And the reason we are really green, when I mean really green, I mean S&P 500 just hit 676. We're talking about new all-time highs in the pre-market type of green.</p>
</details>

这背后的原因是**CPI**（Consumer Price Index：消费者价格指数，衡量通货膨胀的关键指标）数据，说实话，我忘了今天早上会公布。我想你们很多人可能也忘了，但它确实公布了，而且数据比预期的要好。CPI 同比上涨3%，而预期是3.1%。这是自一月份以来的最高读数，八月份是2.9%，所以环比略有上升，但低于预期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh it's because of CPI, which I'm not going to lie, I forgot was coming out this morning. And I think a lot of you guys also probably forgot that it was coming out this morning, but it did. And uh it was better than expected. It was better than expected. CPI comes in at 3% versus 3.1%. This is the highest read since January. August was at 2.9. So, we are up a little bit month over month, but it's lower than expectations. It came in lower than expectations.</p>
</details>

这个数据改变了很多市场动态，关于宏观经济如何反应有很多值得讨论的地方。显然，股市对此非常兴奋，这一点你可以在股价上看到。Nvidia 184美元，特斯拉仍守在447美元，Palantir 试图突破184美元，Grab 三天前还在5.48美元，现在是5.86美元。Robinhood 139美元，试图突破140美元。亚马逊221美元，Meta 突破740美元，Salesforce 又上涨了1%。市场全面开花。以太坊在我直播前刚到4000美元，现在略低于4000美元，但仍有3964美元。比特币在111美元。BMR 突破52美元。你可以看到市场情绪相当高涨。我们得看看开盘后这股势头是会减弱，还是能持续下去。但就目前而言，市场似乎对CPI数据很满意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, this kind of changes a lot of dynamics. There is a lot to talk about in terms of how the macro reacts to this. Obviously, uh, the stock market is really excited about this and you're seeing this in equity prices. I mean, Nvidia 184. Tesla still holding 447. Palinger trying to break 184. Grab Grab was at 548 3 days ago, it's at 586. Robin Hood 139 trying to break 140. Amazon 221. Meta breaking through 740. Salesforce up another 1%. We got everything across board. Ethereum, it was just at 4,000 before I went live. Now it's just below 4,000. But still 39.64. Bitcoin right here at 111. BMR was breaking 52. I mean, you are seeing a decent amount of excitement. We'll see if this gets faded when the market opens or if this has some legs to continue. Um, but as of now, it looks like the market is happy with the CPI.</p>
</details>

让我们更深入地了解一下这份报告。九月份的CPI数据显示，整体指数上涨了0.3%，低于预期。如果我们看剔除食品和能源的**核心CPI**（Core CPI: 衡量潜在通胀趋势的更稳定指标），它也比预期的要温和，上涨了0.2%，而预期是0.3%。关键的同比数据是3%，虽然低于预期的3.1%，但高于上个月的2.9%。剔除食品和能源的核心CPI同比也降至3%，低于预期的3.1%。因此，我们看到利率下降，而股价上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's get a little bit more coverage on this and then we'll talk about some more of these implications. Coming out September read on the consumer price index. Headline number up 3/10enth cooler than both rear view mirror and what we're expecting. And if we look at the stripping out of food and energy known as core, it comes in also a bit less than expected, up 210. We're expecting up 3/10. Our last look was up 3/10. Here's the money ball numbers year-over-year, 3%. And even though it's less than the 3.1 we're expecting, it's hotter than 2.9. And after all, it's got a three handle. And if we look at CPI year-over-year, X food and energy, it also comes in at 3%. We are also expecting 3.1, but last look was 3.1, so it cooled a bit. So, we're seeing interest rates move down and stocks move up.</p>
</details>

你可能会问为什么。简单的答案是，因为它低于预期。但它低于美联储2%的目标吗？没有。在我看来，这个事实迟早会超越当天所有其他问题。但目前，利率确实在走低。这个数字非常重要，因为在没有任何数据点的情况下，市场普遍认为劳动力市场正在放缓，如果你期望美联储继续降息周期，这确实是个好消息。然而，如果你客观地看待这些数字，你最不会想到的就是我们正在接近美联储的目标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You may be asking why. The easy answer, because it's less than expectations. Is it less than the Fed's target of 2%? No. Which in my opinion, that fact will rise above all the issues of the day at some point, but yes, we do see rates moving a bit lower. Ultimately, this is a very important number because the market without any data points has been pretty much viewed on the notion that the labor market is slowing and that really is a good thing if you're looking for the Fed uh cycle to continue its rate cuts. Now, how does this figure in? I can't speak for Fed officials, but if you really have an agnostic view and you look at these numbers, the last thing you think about is we're closing in on the Fed's target.</p>
</details>

但这并不一定意味着他们不会降息。降息的概率仍然相当高，达到98.9%。他们可能不会像一些人预测的那样，在年底前再降息三次，但我们仍然可能看到人们期待的那两次降息。从数据细分来看，能源是最大的影响因素。九月份汽油指数上涨了4.1%，是所有月度项目增长中最大的因素。整体能源上涨1.5%，食品上涨0.2%，住房指数上涨0.1%。服装是涨幅最大的类别之一。而机动车保险、二手车和卡车以及通讯等指数是少数实际下降的项目。市场喜欢这个结果，绝对喜欢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, that that doesn't necessarily mean they're not going to be cutting rates. Uh I mean, the probabilities for cutting continue to be pretty high, still at 98.9%. Uh they might not cut three times as some people are saying towards the end of the year, like an additional three times from the first time we already cut, but we still might get those two cuts that people are looking for. In terms of the summary of this, energy, folks, was the biggest factor. The index for gasoline rose 4.1% in September, was the largest factor of all the monthly items increased. Energy was up 1.5 overall. Food was up 2% on the month uh and home index increased.1%. Uh indexes that increased over the month include shelter, airline fairs, recreation, household furnishings and operations and apparel. Apparel was one of the largest ones. The indices for motor vehicle insurance, used cars and trucks and communication were among the few that actually decreased. Market loves it. Market absolutely loves it right now.</p>

### 动量股回调是否已经结束？

我想问大家一个问题，这个问题在我早上看到CPI数据之前就在思考了。CPI数据可能在某种程度上证实了我的想法。大约两周前，也就是10月10日，市场开始了一轮回调。这次回调其实很严重，虽然标普500指数距离历史高点只下跌了一两个百分点，但影响巨大。大型对冲基金文艺复兴科技公司在过去14天里，自从特朗普和中国的那些事开始后，账面损失了30亿美元。他们今年的收益已经归零，而标普500指数却上涨了12%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So let me ask a question to everybody because this is something I was thinking about in the morning before I got the CPI data. I was thinking about this really for the past couple of days now. Uh, and the CPI data might be potentially kind of confirming it. So on Monday we had let's call it well realistically this started two weeks ago. This started October 10th. By the way the draw down has been so bad over the p you know we're we you know we're down one or two% away from alltime highs which is quote unquote so bad. Renaissance Technologies the the massive hedge fund they took a $3 billion loss on paper over the past 14 days ever since the whole Trump China stuff started which is kind of crazy. So, their gains for the year have gone to zero and the S&P 500 is up 12%.</p>
</details>

他们可能会在未来几天内收复失地，但这恰恰说明了系统中有多少资金因为这些基金加杠杆做多某些股票而被抹去。当你经历3%的回调时，真的会受到重创。标普指数3%的回调最终导致了**高贝塔**（High Beta: 指波动性高于整个市场的股票）和动量股的大幅回调。核能股、量子股等都受到了冲击。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, they'll probably recover that over the next couple of days, but it just goes to show how much money was in the system that ended up getting wiped out from some of these funds because they were levered long on some of these names. And then when you take a 3% draw down, it really takes a hit. So, the the the 3% draw down on the S&P ended up creating a massive high beta draw down, momentum stock draw down, whatever you want to call it. the Oaklows of the world, nuclear stocks, quantum stocks, all that stuff really took a bit of a beating over the past couple of weeks.</p>
</details>

现在，有了CPI数据和过去几天不错的财报数据，我想问大家：动量股的回调结束了吗？如果结束了，那么过去几天逢低买入任何股票的人现在都赚钱了。也许像Oklo这样的股票短期内不会回到19.5美元，但也可能不会再跌回8.5美元，而是在13-14美元的区间稳定下来。我不确定这些动量股是否有能力像标普500指数那样创下历史新高，这可能也是健康的，因为那些股票可能本不该达到那样的高位，至少现在还不是时候。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's the question to everybody in the chat. Now that we have CPI data and we have some pretty good earnings data that we've seen over the past couple of days and next week will be the big one for earnings. Is the draw down in momentum stocks done? That is my question. Is the draw down in momentum stocks done? Do you think that is the case? Because if it is the case, then obviously anyone who has bought the dip over the past couple days in anything, no matter what the stock is, I mean, you can see everything is up right now. HIMS is up, AS, Micro Strategy, Uber, etc., you know, you're green. Now, look, AS maybe is not going back to 102 anytime soon, but that doesn't mean it's going back down to 36. And I think it's the same thing for like an Oaklow. Maybe it's not going back to 195 anytime soon, but it might not be going back to 85 either. So, it chills out in the 130s, 140s type of range. I don't know if we have the ability to have those momentum stocks make new all-time highs like the S&P 500 is making right now. And that's probably healthy because those stocks likely didn't deserve to be at those types of levels, at least not yet.</p>
</details>

但这也意味着，如果标普500指数处于历史高位，并且我们已经清除了市场中大部分的泡沫，那么这可能正在为下一轮上涨创造条件。当然，财报季还没有完全展开，这也是一个问题。但我们看到的那种结构性回调，几乎所有股票都受到了打击。如果现在一切都回到了一个更稳定的状态，也许那次打击理论上可能就没那么严重了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But that also means that if the S&P's 500 is at alltime highs and we've basically flushed out all of the the froth that was there, maybe not all of it, but to an extent a decent chunk of it, then maybe this is creating the next leg up to go higher. The earnings haven't come out yet. That's a good point. Their earnings haven't come out yet, and that's another question uh on what's going to happen with a lot of those names. But the sort of structural draw down that we saw across a lot of names that just took a beating and again every name took a beating, right? Pounder took a beating. It got to 169. Hood got to 120. Those those names took a beating. Grab took a beating. Soi got to 25. Those they took a beating but they didn't take as big of a beating as some of those other names. But if everything is kind of back to a little bit more of a stabilized perspective on this, maybe that beating theoretically might not be that crazy.</p>
</details>

Fundstrat 的 Mark Newton 认为未来几周可能会有一次修正。所以我才问这个问题，因为我们并没有真正的基本面支撑，政府仍然关门。我想说的是，我们是否已经摆脱了十月份的波动？十月一直非常动荡。我们能否以绿色收官？顺便说一句，如果十月今天结束，我们就会是绿色的。标普指数处于历史高位，我们会是绿色的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Funstrat says there could be a correction in the next few weeks. I haven't seen their technical analysis from Mark Newton. I'll try to pull up what he said. Uh but maybe so that that's why I'm asking the question because could this be setting up a little bit more of another draw down because we don't really have anything fundamental. Government's still shut down, etc. to say that we're out of basically I'm trying to say are we out of the woods? Are we out of the woods for the volatility of October? It's been a very choppy October. Could we potentially end out October green? Which, by the way, if October ended today, we would be green. S&P's at all time highs. We would be green. That is what I'm curious to see what people are thinking.</p>
</details>

一位分析师认为，今天的CPI数据对于美联储来说是个好消息，这增强了他们在十月降息的可能性，并可能在十二月遵循**点阵图**（Dot Plot: 美联储官员对未来利率预测的图表）的指引。另一位分析师则认为，当前基本面相当强劲，经济并非疲软，我们正处于一个K型经济中，低端市场不如高端市场强劲。他认为今天的数据更多是关于市场广度的扩大，而不仅仅是人工智能。尽管短期内人工智能和动量股可能因为宽松的金融环境而率先上涨，但市场可能会出现更广泛的普涨，这将是非常健康的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it's even a little bit softer. Um, and so that that's great news for the Fed in terms of uh their ability to to cut in October, which didn't really seem that much in doubt, but also to follow the dot plot in December. No, I think listen fundamentals Joe are pretty strong right now. I there's no doubt about it. You know, the economy is not weak per se. I mean, you've had pockets of weakening. I really do believe we're in a K-shaped economy where the lower end is maybe not quite as strong as the higher end. Um today's number for me is actually about broadening more than it is about AI. Although probably the first step forward is going to be more about AI and some of the momentum plays just because they are juiced by liquidity and we do have easy financial conditions and this will sort of pretend more of that but uh you know I think you can make an argument that you get some broadening here and it's not just about AI. and that broadening obviously would be very healthy.</p>
</details>

57%的观众认为动量股的回调已经结束。看这些股价对CPI的反应，虽然数据只是“好”，并非“惊人”，但市场似乎非常乐于见到任何能够证明通胀没有预期那么糟糕的切实数据。在股市中，大多数时候，认知比现实更重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Having a CPI come in better than expected also would be healthy. 57% of you say yes the momentum draw down is over. 50% of you say yes, the momentum draw down is over. I mean, look, the way some of these stock prices are reacting to CPI, which by like it's good CPI, but I I I mean, I've covered CPI for the past two years. This is not a phenomenal reading of CPI. I mean, it's the highest read since January. It's better than expectations, and in the stock market, perception is more important than reality most of the time, but but it's still a still an aggressive read. I just think because we've got so little data and the market was so happy to finally get some piece of tangible data that could justify like that inflation is not as bad as expected. That's why you're seeing some of this momentum right here across the entire board.</p>

### 特朗普终止与加拿大贸易谈判，市场反应平淡

昨晚发生的最重要的事情，其实被CPI新闻盖过了风头。特朗普在晚上10点左右发推文，称里根基金会宣布加拿大欺诈性地使用了一则以罗纳德·里根负面评价关税为主题的虚假广告。他认为加拿大此举是为了干预美国最高法院的决定，并宣布“与加拿大的所有旧贸易谈判特此终止”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, uh, the CPI story took away from the most important story that happened last night, which I don't even know if it's really that in supportive. I mean, important because I don't know if the market cares, but Trump tweeted at about 10 p.m. Uh, the the Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is fake, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about tariffs. The ad was for $75,000. The only reason they did this is to interfere with the decision of the US Supreme Court and other courts. Tariffs are very important to the national security of the United States. Based on their egregious behavior, old trade negotiations with Canada are hereby terminated. Thank you for your attention to this matter.</p>
</details>

这条推文一出，我立刻去查看券商应用，想看看市场会遭受多大的冲击，结果什么都没有。没人关心。如果那个以C开头的国家是中国而不是加拿大，我不知道CPI数据是否还能拯救我们。要知道，两周前10月10日的那次回调，就是因为一条关于中国的推文。市场似乎完全不在乎加拿大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, this came out at 10:40 and immediately I did what everyone else did, which is you went to your brokerage app and you looked to see like how bad is the carnage and like it was nothing. No one cared. No one freaking car. If that country that started with a C was China instead of Canada, I I don't know if CPI would have been able to save us aside. Remember, the whole reason this draw down started two weeks ago on October 10th is because of a tweet about China. So, it's quite incredible. It's almost like the market doesn't care at all about Canada.</p>
</details>

那则让特朗普大为光火的广告，是由安大略省政府出资的。广告中，里根表示，虽然征收关税短期内看起来是爱国行为，能保护美国产品和就业，但从长远来看，贸易壁垒会伤害每一个美国工人和消费者，并引发激烈的贸易战，最终导致市场萎缩、企业倒闭和数百万人失业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is the ad for those that wanted some context that Trump was so pissed off about. "When someone says, 'Let's impose tariffs on foreign imports,' it looks like they're doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And sometimes for a short while it works, but only for a short time. But over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer. High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars. Then the worst happens. Markets shrink and collapse. Businesses and industries shut down and millions of people lose their jobs. Throughout the world, there's a growing realization that the way to prosperity for all nations is rejecting protectionist legislation and promoting fair and free competition. America's job and growth are at stake." So this is what this this was paid for the government of Ontario.</p>
</details>

特朗普认为这则广告断章取义，是虚假的，并通过推特来管理政策。但重点是，对于投资者来说，没人关心这件事，这有点滑稽。你可能会认为特朗普说要停止与加拿大的贸易谈判会有一些影响，但市场似乎在说：“不，不会的。过几天你们就会恢复正常。” 结果，我们迎来了好的CPI数据，市场继续上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So yeah, I mean, Trump's point is that it's out of context and it's like it's misinterpreting what they said. uh and you know he governs policy through through tweeting and so that's what he said yesterday. But the point is for investors no one cared which is kind of hilarious because you would think like there would be some impact of Trump saying we're not going to do trade with China. All negotiations are quote unquote over. But the market was just like no they're not. You'll be back to normal in a couple days. You'll be okay. And as a result you get good CPI and now we're continuing to go green.</p>
</details>

### 甲骨文豪赌400亿美元，加码数据中心建设

昨晚另一则重大新闻是，甲骨文完成了一笔380亿美元的债务交易，你猜对了，是为了资助更多的数据中心。其中232.5亿美元将用于德克萨斯州的一个数据中心，147.5亿美元将用于威斯康星州的一个数据中心。这两个数据中心都由Vantage Data Centers开发，并将被甲骨文用来支持另一家我们都熟知的公司——OpenAI。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, so let's have this uh sort of transition into the data center conversation because this is the other big story that came out last night and this is why Nebius, Cory, etc., a lot of these names are also green. Um, well, we got a lot of debt coming into Oracle. Oracle completed a $ 38 billion debt deal to finance, you guessed it, more data centers. Um, this is quite remarkable. 23.25 billion will be financed for a data center in Texas. 14.75 billion will be financed for a data center in Wisconsin. Vantage Data Centers is developing both of those, which are going to be used by Oracle to power another company that we all know about, OpenAI.</p>
</details>

这件事有利有弊。先说弊端，很明显，这380亿美元不是自由现金流，不是净利润，也不是营业利润，而是债务。甲骨文正在承担近400亿美元的债务，很可能是通过发行公司债券。他们几周前就这样做了，当时发行了130亿美元的债券，利率为6.5%。简而言之，他们借了400亿美元，并承诺以6%、5%或7%的利率连本带息偿还。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, there's a bull case to this and there's a bare case to this. And let's do the bare case first. I think all of you guys understand the bare case. It's uh you know, one of the things that's kind of glaring you right in the eye, which is that this 38 billion is not free cash flow. It's not net income. It's not operating income. It is debt. It is debt. Oracle is taking on basically $40 billion worth of debt likely through the the sale of of corporate bonds. Uh which they did a couple of weeks ago as well at to the tune of 13 billion. And they were paying six and a half% on those corporate bonds. And so in layman's terms, they are getting 40 billion.</p>
</details>

债权人之所以乐于提供资金，是因为他们相信数据中心是真实的，所有这些人工智能资本支出都会有投资回报。甲骨文也知道，他们的市值可能会大幅上涨，最终即使有利息也能偿还这笔债务，因为数据中心的机遇是巨大的。我认为这是昨晚许多小型数据中心相关公司股价暴涨的主要原因之一，而CPI数据只是火上浇油。甲骨文的行动表明，市场存在400亿美元的需求，而这仅仅是针对两个州的两座数据中心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They are saying, "Hey, we'll pay you back the 40 billion with 6%, 5%, 7%, whatever rate they're offering to the debt issuers." And the debt issuers are happy to give the money because they believe that data centers are real. there's going to be an ROI on all this AI capex spend and Oracle knows that their market cap is likely going to go much higher and they can afford to pay back that debt eventually even with interest because of how massive the opportunity is for data centers and I think that is one of the major reasons I ran and cipher and uh a lot of these other smaller names Navius Coriv etc exploded last night in the overnight market CPI is just adding fuel to the fire is that Oracle saying there is 40 billion of demand and this is just for two data centers in two different states</p>
</details>

与此同时，Jane Street 披露了对三家比特币挖矿数据中心公司的5%持股。需要注意的是，Jane Street 是一家做市商，他们通过**德尔塔中性**（Delta-neutral: 一种期权交易策略，旨在通过对冲来消除标的资产价格小幅变动所带来的风险）的期权策略赚钱。他们持有这些股份并非因为看好这些公司，而是为了方便做市活动，比如向散户出售看涨或看跌期权来赚取权利金。所以，不要过度解读这类新闻。这与像桥水基金或斯坦利·德鲁肯米勒这样的真正有市场观点的基金经理做多是完全不同的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The Bitcoin mining data center companies are up because Jane Street just disclosed a 5% stake in three of them. Okay, so let's talk about this real quick because I think it's very very important for people to understand what's going on right here. When you see the market makers like a Jane Street or a Black Rockck or a Citadel take a stake in these companies, you have to be very cautious in looking at what you're reading here. Jane Street is a market maker. They operate essentially the way they make their money is through a deltaneutral option strategy. So, when you see a Jane Street discloses a 5% stake in Cipher, it's not because they're actually bullish. Bridgewwater you know an actual money manager that has an opinion on the market going long on these names a Stanley Ducken Miller that's a lot different than a market so that's the only difference there.</p>

### 财报季表现强劲，企业盈利能力凸显

昨天，英特尔公布了惊人的财报，股价上涨了6%。他们的每股收益（EPS）达到了23美分，而预期仅为1美分，超出预期2200%。EPS同比增长150%，营收也超出预期4%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First of all, Intel, massive earnings. This stock is up 6%. EPS is up 150% year-over-year. The stock is up more than 90% year-to date. 13.6 billion in revenue versus 13.1 billion. They beat by 4%. So, this is very, very exciting to see. Uh, yeah, only 2200%.</p>
</details>

昨天几乎所有公布财报的公司都在营收和利润上超出了预期。Deckers 的EPS超出15%，福特超出25%，营收也多出30亿美元。这表明对福特汽车的需求比预期的要多出30亿美元。这些公司之所以能超出预期，核心原因是利润率的提升正在全面发生。

<details>

<p class="english-text">It's not just Intel yesterday. I mean, pretty much every company beat on the top and the bottom line. So you got Intel right there that beat by 22 100%. Deckers beat by 15% on EPS. Pneumont beat by 19%. Ford beat by 25%. We're talking about freaking Ford Legacy Auto Company, they also beat by three billion on revenue, which means there was $3 billion worth of more demand for Ford to be able to sell these cars. I think the core argument for all these companies that beat yesterday on earnings is that there is margin efficiency that is happening across the board.</p>

这也是看好数据中心业务的真正原因。如果这些公司因为使用人工智能而提高了利润率，那就意味着他们需要计算能力来维持这种增长。根据甲骨文的交易，我们看到需求在不断增加。然后，像Nebius、CoreWeave、Cipher等小型公司，因为拥有更多设施而获得了大量订单。这又反过来促进了像英特尔这样的公司的生态系统，它们实现了EPS的增长。

<p class="english-text">And this is the real reason to be bullish for a cipher or INE or any of these other data center plays is because the reg reason some of these companies are beating if it is because of AI and increasing their margins that goes back down to the data centers. Like if these companies are utilizing artificial intelligence, increasing their margins, that means you need compute in order to keep increasing their margins, you need more and more demand for that compute. Based on this Oracle deal, we're seeing more and more demand. And then these smaller companies, Nebas, Corey, Vyan, Cipher, Galaxy, etc. They are the ones that are getting a lot of these deals because they have more facilities than other people. And that is leading back to the ecosystem of a lot of these other companies, whether it's an Intel or a Realy Income that are actually generating EPS growth.</p>

这里存在一些矛盾的数据。一方面，我们看到大量数据显示消费者正面临困境，比如私人信贷、汽车贷款拖欠率上升等。但另一方面，你看到这些财报，除非数字是假的，如果越来越多的人在购买鞋子和汽车，也许消费者的状况并没有那么糟糕，尤其是在CPI开始低于预期的情况下。

<p class="english-text">And so there's a lot of conflicting data here because there's tons and tons of data we looked at on why the consumer is struggling, private credit, auto delinquencies, credit card loans, etc. But then you look at these earnings and unless these numbers are fake, if more and more people are buying shoes and jeans with Levis's a couple weeks ago and cars with Ford, I mean, maybe the consumer is not necessarily in that bad of a place, especially with CPI starting to be a little bit lower than expected. You know, maybe inflation is not eating them up as much as people thought.</p>

### 加密货币市场新动向：摩根大通与Robinhood的布局

今天加密货币领域也有一些重大更新。据彭博社报道，摩根大通将允许机构客户在年底前使用他们持有的比特币和以太坊作为贷款抵押品。这标志着华尔街在加密货币整合方面迈出了重要一步。这对于整个行业来说是利好消息。当最重要的消费金融公司站出来说“我们准备接受你的比特币作为抵押品”时，这只会让比特币和其他资产更加制度化和合法化。

<p class="english-text">So, we had some big updates today in the world of crypto that actually potentially were the reasons why Ethereum and Bitcoin broke out a little bit in the morning. Um, take a look at this, folks. JP Morgan as for Bloomberg will allow Bitcoin and Ethereum as collateral if you now want to take out a loan or if you want to finance an opportunity. JP Morgan plans to allow institutional clients to use their holdings of Bitcoin and Ether as collateral for loans by the end of the year and a significant deepening of Wall Street's crypto integration. Look, I think this is bullish for the broader industry. I mean, when you have the most important consumer finance companies coming out and saying, "Hey, we are ready to take uh your Bitcoin as collateral before we give you a loan, it only institutionalizes and legitimize bit Bitcoin and all these other assasses even more."</p>

这就像股票一样。如果你在英伟达上赚了很多钱，但不想卖掉股票来缴税，你可以用它来抵押贷款。如果机构层面可以在摩根大通抵押比特币和以太坊，首先会创造更多的贷款，意味着系统中有更多的资金和资本支出活动，对金融业是利好；其次，也意味着这些资产不必被出售。

<p class="english-text">Yeah, I mean it's like a stock, right? If you're up big on Nvidia, but you don't want to sell your Nvidia to pay the taxes, you can borrow against it. If you can borrow against your Bitcoin and Ethereum on an institutional level with a JP Morgan, it creates first of all more loans, which means more money in the system, more capital spending activity, more um underwriting for a lot of these banks, which is bullish financials, but it also means that those assets don't have to be sold.</p>

此外，Robinhood 已经将493种资产上链，包括股票、ETF、加密ETF、大宗商品、美国国债和私募股权。Robinhood 的 CEO Vlad 昨晚发推表示，**通证化**（Tokenization: 将现实世界资产的所有权以数字代币的形式在区块链上表示的过程）正在开始吞噬整个金融系统。当被问及下一个要通证化的重要资产是什么时，他回答说是房地产。

<p class="english-text">And then if we go deeper into Ethereum, this came out yesterday. Robin Hood has now brought on 493 assets on chain, including stocks, ETF, crypto ETFs, commodities, US treasuries, and private equities. The exciting thing about this and how it's playing out is Vlad was tweeting a lot last night basically saying that tokenization is beginning to eat the entire financial system. And when people asked him, what is the next big asset to tokenize, he ended up saying real estate.</p>

<p class="english-text">So, the momentum names, they took a beating over the past two weeks. Going back to what I was saying at the beginning of the show, maybe that beating is now over. If we look at the rare earth stocks, they are all green. If we look at the Bitcoin miners, they are all green. SoFi 29. IBM says it can successfully run a quantum computing algorithm on AMD chips. Stock didn't really react to that when they announced three weeks ago, but on a day like this when you get a CPI, that's as bullish as we get it. There you Wow. AMD 24875 busted through 248 right there. Nvidia 185. So, AMD really liking that headline. AMD 250. There it is. AMD 250 for AMD.</p>

我们还收到了**PMI**（Purchasing Managers' Index: 采购经理人指数，反映制造业和服务业健康状况的经济指标）数据，服务业PMI为55.2，好于预期的53.5，综合PMI为54.8，也超出预期。这些数据进一步提振了市场情绪，标普500指数继续攀升，一度触及678点。

Uh, PMI comes in at 52.2 versus 52 expected. Services PMI 55.2 versus 53.5. That's a big beat. Overall composite PMI 54.8 versus 53.9. So those are two beats, one miss. The miss was very slight. Dude, that is pretty incredible. I mean, those are some pretty decent PMI numbers along with good CPI. Yeah, look at the S&P new alltime high. S&P loves it. S&P loves it. She wants to break 678.</p>

Fundstrat 的 Tom Lee 预测比特币年底前可能达到20万甚至25万美元。他认为，尽管今年比特币涨幅落后于黄金，但第四季度有美联储宽松、地缘政治风险缓和等多种催化剂，比特币可能会迎来一波巨大涨势。如果这一预测成真，将对Robinhood、Coinbase等相关股票产生巨大影响。

<p class="english-text">I think Bitcoin should really build upon this 120 before the end of the year. So, you know, 200,000, maybe 250 if someone wanted to under. Yeah, I mean we have a lot of time. We have we have 10 weeks. Um as you know Bitcoin makes its move in 10 days a year. So are Bitcoin's best days in the fourth quarter? Probably because we have catalyst the Fed's easing. We have a shutdown that's been riskoff. We have China US tensions that look every time there's a headline on China like Bitcoin takes a gut punch, right? Um because it it is money flows and deleveraging uh so that goes away. We have seasonality that favors stocks moving up and stocks moving helps Bitcoin. So to me uh the chances of Bitcoin having a huge fourth quarter are really high and not all of these would be tailwinds for gold. So I I you know I wouldn't count I still think it's possible for Bitcoin to hit 200,000 by the end of the year.</p>

总而言之，今天的市场情绪非常乐观。每一次下跌似乎都成了买入机会。尽管Fundstrat的技术分析师Mark Newton预测11月可能会有一次回调，但他同样认为年底市场会收高。目前看来，市场的上升趋势依然强劲。

<p class="english-text">Again, if you got if you got super bearish a couple weeks ago, it ended up being a buy the dip. And a lot of the bears, if they thought that was going to be where they kind of find their way to to make to to essentially call a thesis that would stop the earnings growth, stop the capex band, you know, claim recession. We're just not there yet. We don't have the data to suggest that's the case. And the market's not acting like that's the case either.</p>
