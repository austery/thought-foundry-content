title: 新经理直播与2026年频道更新：Amit Kukreja 介绍新成员 Jessica
---

### 频道新篇章：引入新经理与2026年发展蓝图

大家好，欢迎回到频道。这是我新经理直播的正式介绍。我们有很多内容要讨论，也有很多2026年的更新。女士们先生们，这位是 Jessica。

<details>

<p class="english-text">All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to the channel. This is the official introduction to my new manager stream. We got a lot to talk about, a lot of updates for 2026. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Jessica.</p>
</details>

这是她第一次直播，感觉如何？我准备好接受“烤验”了！ [笑声] Jessica 的优点是她拥有16岁少年的幽默感。是的，正如 Doug 所说，经理还是没能让 Amit 准时。我们正在努力改进。但这是令人兴奋的。我们开发 AK Media 这个品牌已经四年了。进入2026年，是时候将其提升到新的水平了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Nice to meet you. >> So, this is her first stream ever. So, how does >> Bear with me? >> How does it feel just like being >> I don't know. I'm I'm ready to get absolutely cooked. [laughter] [gasps] >> She The good thing about Jess is that she has an absolute 16-year-old sense of humor. And yes, as Doug says, the manager still can't get Emit to be on time. No. [laughter] >> So, >> we're working on it. >> We're working on it. But exciting stuff. We got a lot to talk about. Uh, we've been developing this AK Media brand for four years now. And, uh, I think going into 2026, it was time to take it to the next level. Realistically, taking it to the next level means organization, structure, making sure we can actually answer emails because instead of uh not responding to stuff because I'm live all the time, I have someone to help me out. Meetups, getting a lot more formalized results. So, really excited for it. We have a lot of stuff to talk about and uh it's a pretty close-knit community and I'm here every single day. There's something very special with being a live streamer and talking to an audience and getting roasted by the chat every single day. So, uh, the only way to really make this official is if we have the manager getting Gracie in the community. She's already been in the chat for the past couple weeks. >> Yes. >> Yeah. You've already got to know. >> It's been It's been It's been wild. [laughter] >> So, now we're here live.</p>
</details>

那么，Jessica，你到底是谁？你是怎么来到这里的？我叫 Jessica，拥有10年公共关系（PR - Public Relations）经验。我最初在几家全球性公关机构工作。之后，我休息了一段时间来戒酒。我曾严重酗酒，从8岁就开始饮酒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> All right. So, let's get into it. Jess, who the hell are you and and how did you how did you get here? >> How did I get here? Um, well, I am I am Jess. I've been working in public relations for 10 years. I started off um in agencies. I worked for three different agencies, global agencies. Um and then I took some time off to get sober. Um I was drinking heavily. I started um drinking when I was 8 years old.</p>
</details>

>> 真的吗？我当时以为你说的是18岁。她说：“不，是8岁。” 我说：“8岁的孩子怎么能接触到酒精？” 她说：“在古巴可以。” [笑声] Apparently。我花了20年酗酒，然后尝试了10年戒酒，最终决定自己动手，成功戒掉了。我开始真正地关注自我，更留意周围发生的事情，现在，我在这里和可爱的大家相聚。你过去10年在加拿大最大的管理人才机构工作，那段经历怎么样？虽然你那时并没有完全清醒，但你之所以能一直保持最高水平的职业生涯，是因为你付出了巨大的努力。那整个经历是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Dude, when she told me that I was like, "You mean 18, right?" She was like, "No, eight." I'm like, I don't think 8-year-olds get access to alcohol. She's like, well, >> they do in Cuba, [laughter] apparently. And so, um, spent 20 years drinking, tried to stop for 10, and finally took matters into my own hands, got myself off. Um, started to really work on myself, started to pay attention to what was going on around me more, and now, uh, now I'm here with you lovely people. So you worked at Canada's largest management talent agency for the past 10 years. Uh what was that experience like? Because although you were not sober during that time, you were, you know, the reason you stayed employed at the highest of levels is because you were working your ass off. So what was that entire experience like?</p>
</details>

疯狂。那太疯狂了。我需要很早就成熟起来，在很年轻的时候就具备了相当的成熟度。那个领域里，和我同龄的女性甚至男性都很少。所以我必须证明自己，这反而加剧了我的酗酒问题，因为我需要不断地拼搏，需要去克服困难，那是唯一我知道的生存方式。现在，我们已经发展出了更健康的应对机制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Crazy. It was crazy. I got a lot of I just got to grow up really fast. Uh it took a lot of maturity at a young age. not a lot of women or even men my age working in these fields. So, I had to prove myself and that really um fueled the alcoholism more because I just needed to keep banging [ __ ] out and I had to puzzle through it and push through. It was the only way I knew how. Uh so now we've developed healthier coping mechanisms.</p>
</details>

是的。我喜欢这个故事，因为它真实、真诚。我不是一个循规蹈矩的人，我的经历也不是。所以，我也不想被一个循规蹈矩、像个“西装革履”的人来管理。我们不是“西装革履”，我们是一个散户投资社区。我们嘲笑那些“西装革履”的人。所以，我认为这种诚实非常重要。我们相遇的方式是通过一个共同的朋友，也就是你的叔叔，在迈阿密的一次聚会上。我当时和他聊得不多，但我们交换了号码，我很高兴我们这么做了，因为之后我们在11月份重新取得了联系。他给我提出了很多关于如何让聚会更规范、更有组织的想法。他在墨西哥经营夜总会已有40年，所以他的活动策划经验非常丰富。然后他把我介绍给了你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And look, the the the reason I I love that story is because it's authentic. It's real. Uh, I am not a cookie cutter person. I've not had a cookie cutter journey. So, I don't want to be managed by someone who's like cookie cutter and just like a suit. Like, we're not a suit. We're a retail investing community. We make fun of the suits, you know? So, uh, I think that that honesty is really important. And the way that we met was through a mutual connection, who is your uncle, at the Miami meetup. And uh you know we I barely talked to him at the Miami meetup but I we ended up exchanging numbers and I'm really happy we did because then we got into contact back in November and you know he pitched me on a lot of different ideas on how we can make the meetups more structured organized. He has run nightclubs in Mexico for the past 40 years. So just like his event planning experience was pretty big</p>
</details>

>> 然后他把我介绍给了你。太棒了，伙计们，我们得感谢他。我们明白了，她很可爱。天哪。>> 不，这对我的自尊心是极大的鼓舞，请继续。 [笑声] >> 她很可爱。哇，她很漂亮。我的天哪，她太美了。我们明白了。好吧。 [笑声] 我知道。我收到了很多问题，在直播之前。他们问：“她可爱吗？她漂亮吗？” 我没有回答，因为我知道你们会疯掉。>> 你们自己判断吧。 [笑声] >> 你们自己判断。好的。我们有很多事情要谈，有很多内容要深入。我想我们先从这两件事开始，然后我们再谈聚会的事情。所以，明年我想在合作方面将频道引向一个不同的方向。我现在在聊天中放了两个 Google 表格。我会解释这两个表格，然后解释 Jessica 在这里扮演的角色。所以，有两件事，我之前已经提过，但现在我们要正式宣布了。我正在寻找市场开盘和收盘的贡献者，也就是那些基本上像 Jose 那样的人，他们会加入直播，在某个领域是专家，然后能够真正地贡献10到15分钟，解释一个话题或情况。链接就在聊天里。几周前我已经说过，如果你是某个领域的专家，比如半导体、人工智能、石油和天然气，Matt，你不需要报名，因为我们每周都会有 Matt 来解释如何不……（他现在拥有那个股票了）。但请报名，Jessica 将会审核很多申请。这很简单，就是问：你理解什么？能否提供一些你过去谈论过的东西的链接？而且，市场开盘直播的观众人数已经开始增长，平均每天早上有9000人。所以我认为，对于你的品牌、你正在构建的任何东西，或者你的专业知识，我们都能提供传播渠道。我说“我们”，因为现在有两个了。[笑声] 这是一个人的表演。但是的，Jessica，你现在将通过 Jessica 来处理。>> 是的，正是通过 Jessica。所以，一定要报名。我只是想有更多来自社区的贡献者。我知道这里有很多人是某个领域的专家。如果你想尝试社交媒体，或者你有自己的生意，想获得更多曝光，如果你能通过这个社区实现，我认为这会很酷。所以，请报名。稍后我也会放出这些链接，给那些错过的人。第二个链接是播客贡献者。同样，如果你是某个领域的专家，2026年我想做很多长篇播客。这些播客时长为45到60分钟，通过 Zoom 进行，我希望每月都做一次。所以，如果你是债券收益率专家，每个月我都会和你谈45到60分钟，录制成视频，上传到频道，发布到 X 平台，为你提供观众传播。我大概了解债券收益率，但并不真正理解。所以，拥有更多专家非常重要。明年的计划之一就是让更多像你们这样想做点事情、建立品牌的人加入频道，成为贡献者。Chris、Steve、Matt，这一切都是自然发生的，我去他的频道，他来我的频道。我认为我们可以加速这一切，通过播客和市场开/闭市的视角来实现。表格需要权限。好的，我来修复一下。是的，这就是我们要做的。第二个链接在这里是播客贡献者。同样，如果你是某个领域的专家，2026年我想做很多长篇播客。这些播客时长为45到60分钟，通过 Zoom 进行，我希望每月都做一次。所以，如果你是债券收益率专家，每个月我都会和你谈45到60分钟，录制成视频，上传到频道，发布到 X 平台，为你提供观众传播。我大概了解债券收益率，但并不真正理解。所以，拥有更多专家非常重要。明年的计划之一就是让更多像你们这样想做点事情、建立品牌的人加入频道，成为贡献者。Chris、Steve、Matt，这一切都是自然发生的，我去他的频道，他来我的频道。我认为我们可以加速这一切，通过播客和市场开/闭市的视角来实现。

<p class="english-text">>> yeah, >> which is great. We have him to thank >> guys. We get it. She's cute. Okay, we get it. Goodness gracious. >> No, this is great for my ego continue. [laughter] >> She's cute. Wow, she's beautiful. Oh my goodness, she's gorgeous. It's like, yes, we get it. All right. [laughter] You know, I refuse to. So, I got so many questions before we did the stream. They're like, "Is she cute? Is she hot?" I'm not answering because I knew you guys would just be freaking crazy. >> Decide. [laughter] >> You guys decide. Okay. So, we got a lot of stuff a lot of stuff to talk about, a lot of stuff to go into. Um I think we'll start off with the let's start off with these two things then we'll do the meetup stuff. So okay next year I want to take the channel to a little bit of a different direction in regards to collaboration. So I am putting two Google sheets right now in the chat. I'm going to explain both of these and uh then I'll explain kind of Jess's role here. So two things and I already mentioned this before but we're going to make it official now. I am looking for market open and market close contributors, aka people that essentially are like uh Jose, right? That hop on the stream, they're an expert at some type of niche and then they're able to actually contribute whether it's 10 or 15 minutes and like actually explain uh about a topic or or a situation. So, there's the link right there in the chat. And I already said this a couple weeks ago, but if you are an expert in your niche, semiconductors, AI, oil and gas, Matt, you don't need to sign up because we're going to have Matt on every week no matter what to explain how to not bagold BG because now I own that stock. But, uh, then please sign up and Jess is going to be going through a lot of these applications. It's relatively simple. It's just, hey, what do you understand? Can you give us some links of stuff you talked about in the past? And, uh, the market open has started to grow. I mean, it's averaging around 9,000 people every single morning. So, I think the distribution for your brand or for anything you're trying to build or just your expertise is something that we can provide. Um, I say we now because there's two. [laughter] It's just it's a one. It's a oneman show. It's all it is. But yeah, Jess, >> you'll be going through me now. >> Yes, exactly. Be going through Jess. So, definitely sign up for that. And I just want to have more contributors from the community. Like, I'm sure there's so many people here that are experts at something. And like if you want to take a stab at social media or you know you have your own business and you want to just get more exposure for who you are, if you can get it through this community, I think this would be really cool. And so please sign up to that. And I will put these links out later as well for those that that miss it. And then second link right here is podcast contributors. So if you are again an expert in your niche for 2026, I want to do a lot of long form podcasts. So these are podcasts that are 45 to 60 minutes over Zoom and I want to do them monthly. So, if you're an expert in bond yields, uh, every month I want to be able to talk to you for 45 to 60 minutes as a recorded video. We'll upload it to the channel, upload it on X, get you the distribution as well to the audience, um, and allow you to speak about bond yields because I kind of understand bond yields, but I don't really understand bond yields. So, having more experts are really important. So, part of the plan for next year is getting more of you guys that are trying to do something, build a brand, etc. onto the channel, be contributor. I mean Chris, Steve, Matt, all this happened organically and you know Tanner I go on his channel, he goes on my channel. So all that stuff I think we can accelerate next year and we'll do it from the podcast perspective and then the market open market close perspective.</p>

### 线下聚会（Meetups）的组织与展望

好的，我们来谈谈聚会。Jessica，你能不能多介绍一下我们今年是如何组织聚会的？我们选择了一个很棒的地点，在西纽约。大家会聚集在一起，融入社区，互相认识，进行社交。你还可以和 Amit 面对面交流，提问。最重要的是，大家可以一起分享知识、经验，继续发展社区，不断建设。很多人表达了想要更好地了解彼此、在不确定时期共同应对的愿望。所以，这将是一个绝佳的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sheet needs permissions. Okay, let me fix that. But yes, that's what that's what we're going to be doing. Second thing is the meetups. So Jess, why don't you explain a little bit more about how we're structuring the meetups this year? >> Sure. So, um, we've picked an awesome location, um, in West New York. Um, we'll just be all coming together, kind of getting community, meeting each other, networking, um, getting some facetime with AMID as well. You get to ask some questions, um, and really just coming together to share knowledge, share experience, keep growing the community, keep building. Um, and a lot of people have voiced just like a a need or desire to get to know each other better, to have this one-on-one time and navigate certain and uncertain times together. So, this will be a great opportunity.</p>

Jessica 在聚会和现场活动方面经验丰富，过去10年她曾为可口可乐（Coca-Cola）、麦当劳（McDonald's）等众多知名品牌进行管理和差旅。她在组织和策划方面的想法非常宝贵。我们在迈阿密聚会时遇到的最大问题是：我一个人，而你们很多人。如何让我能见到每个人？如果我不能和每个人聊几分钟，那就是我的失败。所以，我们有很多想法可以改进这一点，让明年的聚会更精彩。聚会的链接在这里，在 Eventbrite 上。时间是2月1日，地点等所有信息都在链接里，时间是中午12点到下午6点。原定是1月25日，但我们发现那天是体育赛事周末。所以，改到了2月1日。聚会需要购票，价格是75美元。我想详细说明这75美元包含什么。首先，这不是一个盈利项目，也不是一个生意。你们认识我很久了，我从不做 Discord 课程或接受赞助。我从未在频道上接受过任何赞助，也没有每月5或10美元的会员费来获取内容。坦白说，聚会对我来说是自私的，是为了能与观看我的观众建立联系。每天早上都有屏幕后面的人。在现实中见到他们，这就是聚会的目的。这也是去年这个想法的初衷。过去五次聚会都相当成功。但我们要将其提升到新的水平。要做到这一点，就需要资金。场地有成本，安保也有成本，我们会非常重视安保。餐饮和酒水也有成本。所有这些加起来就是75美元。我猜可能还有两三美元的利润。大部分利润会重新投入到聚会中。希望75美元不算太贵。不是100美元，不是200美元，也不是30美元。也许有一天，我们可以降低成本。也许有一天，这会成为一个真正盈利的生意，有1万人报名参加某个体育场，我们举办一个 OLED 峰会，那可能会赚很多钱。但那不是今天。今天，我们是在为真正建立这个社区打下基础。

<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, Jess has been dealing with meetups and live events and she's been traveling to manage um like Coca-Cola and all these crazy brands, McDonald's over the past 10 years. So, she has a lot of experience in dealing with live events and you know the idea she had on structuring it, organizing it. The biggest issue we had in Miami is just like there's one of me, there's a lot of you. So, how do we get me to be able to see everybody because I think it's a failure if I don't get to at least talk to everybody for a couple minutes. And so, there's a lot of ideas we have to make that a lot better and uh more exciting for next year. So, this is going to be the link for that. It's on Eventbrite. Um, and it is going to be February 1st. the locations and everything is on the link from 12:00 p.m. to 6 p.m. It was going to be January 25th, but then we realized that football >> sports >> sports or that weekend. So, it's going to be February 1st. Uh there will be a ticket price. So, it will cost $75 to get access to this. And I just kind of want to break down what that $75 entails. So, number one, this is not a profitable venture for me. This is not a business. This is not trying to be a business. You guys know me for a long time now. I don't do Discord courses, sponsorships. I've never taken a single sponsorship on the channel. There's no five $10 a month to get access to any content. Realistically, the meetups are selfishly for me in in ability to connect with the people that are actually watching. So, there's people behind the screen every morning. Seeing them in person is the point of the meetups. And that's was the initial genesis of the idea last year. Ended up being pretty successful over the past five meetups that we've done. But we want to take it to the next level. To take it to the next level, you need to have money. So, there's a venue cost, there's a security cost. We're going to take security very seriously. There's a food cost, alcohol cost. All of that results in 75 bucks. I think maybe there's two, three bucks at the end left in margin. A lot of that will be reinvested back into the meetups. So, I hope 75 is not crazy. It's not 100, not 200. It's it's not 30 bucks. And maybe one day we'll be able to get the cost to be lower. One day maybe this will become a really profitable business where 10,000 people sign up to some stadium and we have like an OLED summit and that might make a lot of money. But that's not today. And today it's it's the it's the putting in the ground work to really set up this community.</p>
</details>

>> 花费一些钱，但希望75美元不算太离谱。>> 会是一段很棒的时光。一次愉快的聚会。>> 是的。那我们要做什么呢？是早午餐。含羞草早午餐。美食，好的人，好音乐。绝佳的风景。美丽的景色。>> 是的，我觉得会很有趣。会很有趣。而且你看，这里的好处是，如果这次成功了，我们知道如何组织，那么芝加哥，内特就不会再问了，还有洛杉矶、休斯顿等等。>> 是的，我们应该定成67美元。我们应该…… [笑声] 那样会好得多。那样会做得更好。但……是的，这将为我们能够租赁世界各地的其他场地并继续发展奠定基础。所以，这就是想法。活动期间可以直播吗？我们可能会。我们正在研究很多不同的事情。也许我们会直播。也许我们会弄清楚。但至少对于第一次，我们要把它做好，然后继续前进。所以，链接就在那里。我们限制人数为300人。如果达到300人，那就是上限，因为我认为超过这个人数就太多了。未来，我们再看。是的，我们会再次去多伦多，因为>> 加拿大人都在这里。>> 她喜欢多伦多，我也喜欢多伦多。 [笑声] 但她来自蒙特利尔，比多伦多更喜欢那里。好吧。所以，这些是主要的公告，现在我们只是坐下来放松，回答任何问题。 [笑声] 我们明白了。她很可爱。好吧。天哪。>> 我吗？ [笑声] >> 她真漂亮。她太美了。就是这样。我们明白了。你知道，这很有趣。我说：“嘿，Jessica，你信教吗？” 她说：“不，但我……你是精神上的。” [笑声] 就像每个女孩一样。我说：“不，我不信教。我是精神上的。有一种神圣的女性特质，我与之连接。” >> 是的。 >> 我说对了。当然，我猜对了。>> 是的。而且它很有力量。>> 嗯，希望明年它能非常有力量，让我们继续下去。好吧。那么，我们来问一些问题。我们从这个问题开始。在蒙特利尔长大是什么样的？>> 嗯，很有趣。我在非常希腊的祖父母家长大，他们的孩子也是希腊人。但我在家必须说希腊语，而蒙特利尔在魁北克省。魁北克是法语区。>> 这是加拿大的朝鲜。 [笑声] Tanner 也证实了我说的，我脑子里想的。>> 是的，这…… [笑声] 很多。嗯，那很有趣，需要去适应。但那里很美，雪很多，非常冷。路况很糟糕，但没关系，因为这是蒙特利尔的美丽的一部分。>> 但你喜欢……你喜欢……你欣赏加拿大文化吗？加拿大文化有什么让你产生共鸣的吗？>> 是的，你知道加拿大就是……它是一片美丽的土地。就像一个美丽的地方，可以迷失在它的公园里，探索自然，它……它绝对美丽。他们在一些事情上…… [ __ ] 相当多，当涉及到人口和他们如何处理它时。所以，我不知道我现在是否非常自豪，但……嗯，但我爱我来自的地方，它给了我今天拥有的一切。>> 好的。那么，如果你要在成为美国人或加拿大人之间做选择，>> 你会……你……我总是问 Tanner 这个问题，他仍然坚称加拿大，尽管他不是。是的，>> 他是个彻头彻尾的资本家。我不知道。>> 我是加拿大人。>> 好的，所以你……你比……>> 是的。 [笑声] >> 嗯，好的。这是一个好问题。她投资吗？>> 我投资吗？嗯，我的投资之旅很早就开始了。我祖父在我出生时，嗯，拿出几美元，投资了一些银行股，一些迪士尼股票。嗯，随着我长大，这些股票也在增长，由我父亲和祖父管理，然后传给了我。但后来，我成长于一种……一种移民心态，就是我们一无所有，不要碰任何东西，因为它不是我们的。所以对我来说，我从未真正将那些投资视为我自己的财富，只是某种存在的东西，我并不真正理解。它带来了很多焦虑。嗯，就像不理解它的全部范围，以及……嗯，你知道……只是紧紧抓住你所拥有的。嗯，这就是我开始投资的原因。

So, how do we get me to be able to see everybody because I think it's a failure if I don't get to at least talk to everybody for a couple minutes. And so, there's a lot of ideas we have to make that a lot better and uh more exciting for next year. So, this is going to be the link for that. It's on Eventbrite. Um, and it is going to be February 1st. the locations and everything is on the link from 12:00 p.m. to 6 p.m. It was going to be January 25th, but then we realized that football >> sports >> sports or that weekend. So, it's going to be February 1st. Uh there will be a ticket price. So, it will cost $75 to get access to this. And I just kind of want to break down what that $75 entails. So, number one, this is not a profitable venture for me. This is not a business. This is not trying to be a business. You guys know me for a long time now. I don't do Discord courses, sponsorships. I've never taken a single sponsorship on the channel. There's no five $10 a month to get access to any content. Realistically, the meetups are selfishly for me in in ability to connect with the people that are actually watching. So, there's people behind the screen every morning. Seeing them in person is the point of the meetups. And that's was the initial genesis of the idea last year. Ended up being pretty successful over the past five meetups that we've done. But we want to take it to the next level. To take it to the next level, you need to have money. So, there's a venue cost, there's a security cost. We're going to take security very seriously. There's a food cost, alcohol cost. All of that results in 75 bucks. I think maybe there's two, three bucks at the end left in margin. A lot of that will be reinvested back into the meetups. So, I hope 75 is not crazy. It's not 100, not 200. It's it's not 30 bucks. And maybe one day we'll be able to get the cost to be lower. One day maybe this will become a really profitable business where 10,000 people sign up to some stadium and we have like an OLED summit and that might make a lot of money. But that's not today. And today it's it's the it's the putting in the ground work to really set up this community. >> It will cost some money but hopefully 75 is is not too crazy. >> It's going to be a great time. A great time. A boozy brunch. >> Yeah. So what are we what are we doing there? It's a brunch. Mimosas brunch. Good food. Good people. Good music. A great view. A beautiful view. Um, and yeah. >> Yeah, I think it'll be fun. It'll be fun. And see, and the the good thing about this here is like once if this works out well and we know how to structure it, then Chicago, so Nate stops asking and LA and Houston and all that stuff. >> Yeah, we we should have made it $67. We should [laughter] That actually would have been way better. That would that would have done way better. But um yeah, that it'll it'll set up the framework to be able to rent out other venues across the world and and keep this going. So yeah, that's the idea. Can you go live during the event? We might. We're working on a lot of different things. Maybe we'll live stream. Maybe we're going to figure it out. But at least for the first one, we want to get it out of the way and yeah, we'll keep going from there. So that's the link right there. So 300. We're capping it at 300. Uh, I don't even know if we're going to get to 300, but if we do, then 300 is the limit because I think above that is too much. In the future, we'll see if we go from there. Yes, we will do Toronto again because >> the Canadians in the house. >> She loves Toronto and I I love Toronto, too. [laughter] But she is from Montreal more than she likes that more than Toronto. All right. So, those were the uh those were the major announcements and now we're just going to sit and chill, take any questions. [laughter] We get it. She's cute. Okay. Goodness. >> Who me? [laughter] >> She's so pretty. She's all this. You know, you know this is funny. I was like, "Yo, Jess, are you religious?" She was like, "No, but I'm Oh, you're spiritual." [laughter] It's like every girl. I was like, "No, I'm not religious. I'm spiritual. There's a divine femininity that I connect to. >> There is. >> And I was right. Of course, I was right. >> There is. And it's powerful. >> Well, hopefully it's gonna be really powerful next year to keep this going. All right. So, we'll do some Q&A. Um, let's start off with this. What was it like growing up in in Montreal? >> Um, interesting. I grew up with very Greek grandparents and and their children were Greek, too. But um had to speak Greek at home and Montreal is um is in Quebec. Quebec is a Frenchspeaking. >> It's the North Korea of Canada. [laughter] And Tanner affirmed what I said, what I was thinking. >> Yeah, it's [laughter] a lot. And um so that was that was interesting to navigate. Um but it's beautiful. Lots of snow, very cold. The roads suck, but that's okay because it's all part of the thetik. It's all part of the beauty of Montreal. >> But did you like did you did you appreciate Canadian culture grow? Like what is there a Canadian culture that you like resonate with? >> There is um you know Canada is just it's beautiful land. Like it's just a beautiful place and to get lost in its parks and and explore nature it's it's it's absolutely beautiful. they [ __ ] up quite a bit with some things [laughter] when it came to the population and how they handled it. So, I don't know that I'm super proud of that right now, but um but I love where I'm from and it's afforded me everything I have today. >> Okay. So, if you get to pick a choice between being American and Canadian, >> would you would you I ask this to Tanner all the time and he still swears by Canada even though he's not. Yeah, >> he's a full-on capitalist. I don't know. >> I'm Canadian. >> Okay, so you're you're more loyal than >> Yeah. [laughter] >> Um, okay. Here's a good question. Does she invest? >> Do I invest? Well, so my investing journey started at a very young age. My grandfather, when I was born, um, took a couple of dollars and put it into some some bank stocks, some Disney stocks. Um, and that grew as I was getting older, being managed by my dad and my grandfather, and then uh passed off to me. But then like I grew up in a really like the immigrant mentality of we have nothing and don't touch anything because it's not there. So to me, I never really saw those investments as like my own wealth, just something that exists that I didn't really understand. And it it brought a lot of anxiety. um just like not understanding the full extent of it and and and you know just like holding on for dear life to whatever you have. Um and that's what kickstarted investing for me. >> Yeah. So she's not kneede into like oh my goodness Broadcom's down 10% and you know what Broadcom is? >> No. >> No. Okay. So she shouldn't like you shouldn't care about that. So, we're definitely going to turn her into someone who watches the uh candlesticks all day >> and make her excited about the markets. But, no, I like this because it's like >> the the the investing community once you get a a sniff of it, like you become a bit obsessed >> and all of us here have that moment, you know, and maybe you have that moment, maybe you don't, but >> I know you're excited about the concept. >> Well, I'm here for a reason. [laughter] So, yeah, definitely. >> Yeah. So, I think that will that will be exciting as well. >> Get me on the predictions. >> Yeah, we need to get you on the prediction markets as well. By the way, guys, I just interviewed someone uh like 30 minutes ago. That interview will be out next week, but let's just say they work at the Hood of the Robins. It's not Vlad, someone else. I think you guys will enjoy it. Um, we talked a bit about prediction markets, so that'll be out next week as well. Uh, favorite movie. That's a That's a good one. >> Favorite movie? Rent. >> It's a classic. >> Yeah. Rent. Definitely. >> That's a great one. >> I own it on DVD. >> Really? >> Yes. >> You You liked it that much that you own it? >> Oh, yeah. >> It's a classic. >> It's a great movie. I really like the part where the guy like >> does that thing. >> Does that thing? >> Yeah. It was great. Yeah. >> Yeah. A key moment in the movie. And then he couldn't pay the rent, right? Nope. >> Which is why he had to work. >> And then they were singing about how are they going to pay. >> Exactly. And so they became a musical and >> and here we are. The rest is history. >> And I like musicals. >> I love musicals. >> There you go. >> I love musicals. I don't care if that makes me something. >> Okay. She hasn't watched Rounders, though. So you're you're not a big movie person. >> No. >> Which is another thing that's perfect here. >> I was busy drinking. [laughter] >> I didn't have much time. >> Okay. So let's let's >> priorities. >> Let's get deeper into that. How does one even access alcohol at 8 years old? >> Okay, so you go to a resort with your parents and you meet someone who's drinking. My favorite thing on earth is anything blue raspberry. Like I just will eat that [ __ ] up. And so I saw this girl with a blue raspberry slush and I asked her what it was. She goes, "It's a Blue Mountain." I said, "Bet. Go to the bartender. I asked him for a blue mountain and he's giving me like seven of six or seven of these a day. [laughter] >> Dude, we are too old to be We are too old to be doing this [ __ ] >> It's okay. I'm crashing out. [laughter] And so, [snorts] um I And I was drinking those for like a week straight and like I'm passing out all over the place. I'm like they're putting chairs together because I can't keep my eyes open. And I'm like asking my mom, please like, you know, let's take one of those golf carts to your to your room. And she's like, get up. I'm taking a golf cart. Like, what is this? So, [laughter] finally on the last day, I asked my mom like, "Can I please have one more Blue Mountain for the road?" And my mom has a sweet tooth. So, finally, she actually took a sip of it. And her eyes, like, I was terrified. Never mind the bartenders and what they were about to hear. I was I knew that was it for me. And uh it turns out it was that blue carac liquor with rum >> and crushed ice >> and I was a very small child >> and so >> it essentially created a subliminal uh desire correct for alcohol. >> Exactly. And then after that, especially in Greek families, like with a lot of night life and just, you know, a lot of gettogethers that involved alcohol. So, at which point was it like, well, she she can have a glass of wine, >> right? >> The damage has kind of been done, [laughter] >> right? Um, and then yeah, I got this really big affinity for alcohol and and I was drinking a bottle of tequila a day and chasing that with a bottle to half a bottle of wine. Um, that went on for the last 10 years. And those 10 years is like I every single day was day one. I was trying to today I'm not going to drink. Today I'm not going to drink. Today I'm not going to drink. And then finally I really stopped. I didn't really have a choice. It was going to be that or no >> something way worse. >> Yeah. And I I I think I I think people >> I I think people can relate to this if you if you've you know gone through the alcoholic route. You know to me it's it's so interesting because I grew up around so much alcohol because my dad had a liquor store but he didn't drink. My mom didn't drink. So then I never ended up like really drinking. But but like I can only imagine at eight years old you end up having a fun resort and subliminally you get because we all have things that happen at a very young age that end up forming the basis of our like when I was young like I I would I would make jokes and like my mom would laugh so that told me I'm meant to be a comedian and so now I get to make jokes in front of people every single day. So like you know again subliminally creates the foundation. >> Yeah. But like that's a real thing. And so, okay, bottle of tequila a day while you're at a high functioning management job. >> How did you eventually tell yourself it's time to get off that? >> Uh, well, like I said, it was it was really like 10 years coming. Um, I just knew it in my body. Like my body felt like battery acid. I yeah I I was really it was that day that I was wrestling with the bottle because I wasn't drinking out of glasses or cups at that point. So >> and I had the bottle on the floor and I picked it up and I was going back and forth with it and I really felt in my bones I'm like this is going to be a like if I drink this right now that's it. And so I struggled a lot. I cried a lot and then I tossed the bottle to the ground. I got myself in an Uber. I went to the doctors and I said, "You're going to put me on something or I'm going to find it myself." Um, got on some SSRI just to take [laughter] the edge off a bit. Um, and then finally I weaned myself off of those two and I'm raw dogging it. >> Yeah. I mean, dude, it's I have a lot of respect for someone who can go through that type of journey and any type of addiction. You know, alcohol is just obviously a a more aggressive addiction, but >> once you get off of it, it's like a new life. So, okay, so it's been two years sober. What is that experience been like and the clarity >> you might have received from it? >> The clarity is coming in now. So, I'll be two years in April. Um, it the first six months was really just like breaking down and I I couldn't move. I wasn't showering. I was showering once a month and it was even that was hard. Like I really couldn't take care of myself at all. But I just kind of like I trusted my divine feminine being and I just knew that like the worst was done. I needed to push through that period. And there was a lot going on, a lot of uncertainty in my life. A lot of I mean I'm living alone. I'm >> doing the thing and >> being independent. being independent and um and I remember my mom was looking at me one day and she was just like visibly concerned and I told her I'm like just trust me like I know what it looks like right now but in a year from now I'm going to be a completely different person and trust me it's going to be okay and like no one wants to see their kid going through that. No one wants to see their kid in that state. So she like >> she believed me but she was just so terrified which I completely understood. And then and then slowly slowly the clarity started to come. Um I really crashed out. I had to completely like break down and really hit a bottom and a low. Feel depths that I've never felt before. Feel highs that I didn't think I would ever feel and learn how to sit with those emotions. Learn how to exist with them. Um, it also brought a lot of light to how I was acting. Uh, my behavior, not just like in relationships or with my friends or family, but even at work, like rather maybe not toxic behavior, but I had so much anxiety constantly. The alcohol was suppressing the anxiety. It was allowing me to work through the anxiety. >> So, seeing how I mean, I wasn't very communicative with people. I wasn't um you know and whatever I was saying it wasn't what I actually was feeling and meant. And so now that I actually live that way, it's opened up a whole other universe for me and I I kind of love it. >> Someone said this is perfect. I just woke up and I'm so hung over. [laughter] >> Oh my gosh, >> dude. The first time we met, I thought we were going to like have our meeting and go get drinks and then she drops this on me and I'm like, "Well, we're not getting drinks. That's that's not happening." >> No. [laughter] But >> but like just cuz I can't have fun doesn't mean everyone else should. And I'd still go out. That was the other part that was really weird for me too. Working in PR, being in events and having an uncle in night life, having a lot of really cool family members that like having a good time, you know, how do you just like stop your life? And I grew up in bars for various different reasons. I I was just always connected to night life. So when I got sober, I'm like, well, what the hell do I do now? And um I started to write um and I started to go to bars and people were looking at me like what are you doing? Like you're this is setting yourself up for failure. And the reality is that I'm so honest about my story and I'm so honest about where I'm at. The second I walk into any establishment, I tell people very clearly, I'm an alcoholic. I want to be able to come here and enjoy myself. Under no circumstances do I ever want to be in a position where I'm potentially going to drink something by accident. There's going to be alcohol in it. And also, it keeps me accountable. >> Yeah. Because now there are thousands of people that know that this is my story and they if they ever were to catch me in a position, you know, like it it really it's accountability, taking ownership of your life and just toughing it out. >> Yeah. Look, this is the [ __ ] that I like. I like the the the raw authentic stories, like the real stories that like actually define a human. Especially like look, I'm not some massive company where I have a bunch of employees or anything like that. So to bring someone on to like I've been pretty independent for the past four years. I have figured out how to build a brand, how to invest, how to manage an online community, you know, realistically by myself. There was no playbook to do this. So, if I'm bringing someone into the community, like I want someone who's dealt with some real [ __ ] you know, and who's honest enough to like not be afraid to tell their story and vulnerable enough to be okay with the transparency of like it's a process that you're getting better at and grateful enough where like because you've gone through that journey, you now know what it feels like to not be stuck in that phase. >> Exactly. >> Because we've all had phases that we've been stuck inactly >> and right now it's such a weird time. Everyone's weird. Everything's weird. And you know, we need to like kind of show ourselves some grace. And I feel like, you know, just just own it. Like cuz, you know, people would tell me a lot too when I first started talking about my story and just explaining my situation and they were like, you know, you really shouldn't be as vocal about it because people are going to judge you. And I was like, dude, they're going to judge me anyway. So, >> people judge me every morning. I mean, I >> uh tried to land some jokes this morning. It didn't land. >> Didn't >> But it's like >> Why is that you think? >> Well, that's a deeper philosophical conversation. But >> no, I see the jokes definitely landed. There were some people that were laughing, but the majority were probably laughing at me, not with me. But that's okay because >> a laugh's a laugh. >> A laugh's a laugh. A laugh is indeed a laugh. Triple V, thank you for being here. Thank you for the $200 super chat. Uh, I might be meeting Triple V in a few weeks or a month. Jess might meet him. Do you know TripleB at all? >> Okay, >> I'm meeting this whole community right now. Yeah, in real time. >> You'll you'll love him. He's he's an awesome guy. Um >> I'm excited. >> Steve, thanks for the super chat. Welcome, Jess. Hope it works 100%. >> Thank you. >> Spencer says, "Jess is a hottie." >> Thanks, Spencer. [laughter] >> And then Matt, thanks for the super chat. Can she make you show up on time? >> I'll do my best. You can hold me accountable. It's like, dude, the last couple minutes before going live, it's impossible. So, yeah, we're gonna we're gonna try to see what we can do. Um, poetry. Are you into So, so you do like writing. >> Uh, are you into reading, fiction, non-fiction? Do you want to write fiction, non-fiction? How do you think of that work? >> Really good question. Um I so I was writing poems for when I first got sober. It was all poems and it was there was one actually my uncle Angelo um he ended up like screenshotting it and printing it and posting it and it was like about sprinkles and unicorns and like seeing worlds like you know when when the when the the fog finally lifts. And then I started to cringe myself out a little bit too much. And I it started with like journaling, but then my mind started going places that it never was allowed to when I was drinking. >> Um, and I started to just like play a lot of connect the dots with my own lived experience. I love talking to people. I love connecting with people and meeting them. And I love hearing their stories because you get to understand where everyone's coming from. We all come from different like walks of life. We've all experienced different things, but um there are some things that like remain true and and and I have because I've felt those depths and I've allowed myself to >> You actually went through some [ __ ] in life. >> Exactly. [laughter] So >> people It's hard to like write about experiences or make music about stuff if you haven't lived through it. >> Exactly. Exactly. And I find like even like even with therapists and stuff like I I find the best counselors, the best people that are in a position to support you are the ones who've actually lifted and been there. And that's kind of what I wanted to accomplish with my writing. I wanted to kind of just be a safe space for people to feel without feeling like they're gonna without feeling the shame and the guilt that often comes with a lot of these things and and a lot of these emotions for men especially. >> Yeah. >> Um and yeah, just kind of be a resource, maybe make some laughs. >> Yeah. >> Perspective. >> I I I think I think if if your story also can help other people that are going through the same thing. >> For sure. You know, that's a big deal >> for sure. We're so not alone. And there's just so much love. >> She is not moving in with me. She is not my girlfriend. You're not getting married. This one's You can't make these like grinder jokes and [laughter] then do a 180 like that. By the way, she knows these jokes, too. >> I do. And I saw some coming through there, too. It's all right. >> Yeah. So, like this is not Guys, you cannot have it both ways. Like if you're gonna pick one. Like not do not not harass me from both sides. Like pick one. >> But no, she is uh you know in all seriousness like I I really did need help going into the future. Like there's just no way to scale whatever we're I mean I got some big dreams going into the next five years. I mean just like the past two years have showed me where this could go. And then the question becomes do you have the work ethic, the ambition, the the ability to generate um people that actually give a [ __ ] You know, like I could have hired any random person that could do it like, you know, handle your emails. Like we're talking about someone who's going to be with you for the next 5 to 10 years, go on a journey with you and participate in the upside of that journey. >> Yeah. >> And you know, I was I was telling you about Derek. Derek is also a friend of the chat. TripleB is a good friend of Derek. And he had uh someone who essentially became his like life manager and handled a lot of stuff for him like 30 years ago. And they're still tight. Tight as ever >> and like they're not like best friends. >> It's gonna be us. >> Yeah. Well, I mean like the only way for that to happen is if you have a real bond with someone and you both are like motivated to go to that next level together. >> Yeah. >> And so that was cool. And honestly, just seeing this, seeing you in your element the last few times that we've met, I feel like I kind of I want to take that lift off of you because there's so much exciting things coming down the pipeline and there's so much for you to do and grow with this community. And so, if I can just like take some of that lift off of you. >> Yeah. >> Do I swear too much? >> No, you don't. It's [laughter] just like this. No, you don't. But it's uh it is it is a rampage of comments. >> I'm classy. I promise. >> She's doing a good job. She's managing the chat. [laughter] I mean, I have to deal with this [ __ ] every day and I've learned how to deal with it. So, >> she's in love. Oh, don't put words in my mouth. [laughter] >> Mixed babies is ridiculous. Actually, >> right after the Grinder comment is excellent. >> Yeah, it's like >> our [clears throat] kids will see that one day. [laughter] >> There you go. That's what's going to happen. >> Um, okay. Let's ask you some stock questions. So, do do you I actually never asked this, so I don't know what the person Do. Do Do you Do you know what like Palenture is? >> I do. >> Like, okay. So, what does Paler do? [laughter] >> You don't want me to answer that? >> Okay. Uh, someone's been reading CNN a little too much. Um, >> the oh no started. [laughter] >> That's why we can't get married, guys. like, "No way that's going to work." No way. Um, >> my uncle calls me a snowflake. >> Okay. So, no, no, she like she's a snowflake, but then when you get deeper into the conversations, she's a raging conservative. So, I But I feel like that's a lot of Canadians. Like, >> you're like you got the snowflake feel, but then when you go a little deeper, some stuff that your country has done has pissed you off so much. >> Yeah, horribly. I mean, we have language police. What the heck is that? Okay. So, let's talk about what what do you feel about the Quebec language enforcers? >> I think that if your medical system works, if your roads don't have craters in them the size of actual planets, that can cause a lot of damage to cars, that can hurt people. that everything is working and you are a functioning society, >> then I think yes, you should protect your culture. I'm super proud. I'm Greek. I'm very proud of my my heritage and my roots. I'm also proud to be Canadian. Um, so I completely understand wanting to protect something. Um, but I don't necessarily agree with pushing millions of dollars into two different types of literal police for language to enforce this to the point where people are getting fined on Facebook if they post in English. I get it and I understand, but it's just there's like too much going on. It's a little tonedeaf. It's a little it's a waste of money. It's a waste of taxpayer money. >> It's authoritarian. Like it's >> the fact that you said every sign has to be replaced in French. Like I get protecting the language, but I mean imagine America did that. Imagine every democracy said we're going to protect this one thing and like for all the [ __ ] America gets like we we try to embrace a lot of cultures. Yeah. >> And it's like we get a lot of [ __ ] But then the place that actually don't embrace other are the ones that are like seen as >> Yeah. And I feel like when you're put like so I'm a little bit jaded because I did grow up with again my grandparents were Greek so I spoke to them in Greek. We spoke English at home and then school had to be French and I mean she was drinking at 8. So like I had things on my mind and I wasn't really the most studious for the French language. Uh it was it just it it came a little bit harder for me. Then going into high school, I had French teachers who would like tell me they hated me in front of students >> because you didn't speak the language. >> Because I just I wasn't getting things and like they would get super frustrated with me and not really I don't think that's a fair way to teach people. But then as I grew up, I realized that my story resonated with a lot of people. A lot of people went through the same thing. >> Yeah. And there is sort of like a snarky attitude that comes with like the French which I kind of like embrace sometimes when I'm in that mode but it you know you you can't act that way and it's kind of detering people from if you're pushing it down their throats and you're instilling fear into people instead of promoting it like a beautiful language something an opportunity to you know grow your mind expand your horizons like very very different messaging. Maybe they need like a PR rebrand on on the French. >> Well, it's not the entirety of Canada, right? It's just >> No, it's just Quebec. >> Yeah. >> Like they speak French in different provinces. It's just >> the the the in Quebec that it's it's it's it's by law that it's enforced. Like they go to my mom's office and and check to make sure that her keyboards are French and if there's Crazy. >> Yeah, if the keyboards aren't in French, then fines, fines, fines, fines. And we pay a lot in taxes. Like a lot. >> Yeah, she was telling me the tax percent. I mean, I know Canada's crazy, but like that's >> pretty wild. Shout out to Pedro. You just bought a ticket for him and his wife. Looking forward to it. Uh, again, I will have more updates. Uh, we got about two months until we have the meetup, so I will constantly make sure that everyone is updated on it. But New York, February 1st, and if you're making a weekend out of it, then you know, you fly in a couple days before and then you could fly out that uh that Monday morning. Um, what what do you think about Elon Musk? >> Do you hate me? [laughter] >> I actually haven't asked you that question. So, you just got a lot of Tesla investors in the chat, so choose your words wisely. Like, >> I think that >> he's a visionary. He's changed the world. >> He was I mean uh Grimes is uh from Quebec. >> Is he from Quebec? >> So I guess his child is by proxy sort of >> Canadian >> ish. >> Well, he's Canadian. No, no, he's South Africa. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. >> I think that he should do some more media training. [laughter] >> That's what I think you should. Again, it's all about messaging. as long as you're positioning yourself in a certain way, you know, it makes the the the nonsense and the noise like kind of cancel out a bit. >> Look, but Elon fans are going to hate that you say that and there's a lot of Elon haters that are like, "Yeah, he needs to work on messaging." So, that's fair. Um, do you do you uh are there any companies that you buy products from that are like uniquely tailored towards your demographic like Lululemon or any of these brands? Are there any of these that you get like Starbucks? Like are you a coffee person? >> I drink Red Bull. I shouldn't. >> Really? You drink? >> Yeah, I drink Red Bull >> like every day. >> Not as much. I when I stopped drinking like Dead to the World, four Red Bulls a day like to the face and that was crazy. But um I guess makeup would be >> Yeah. Like E.L.F. Ulta. Is that your thing? We're asking because we're trying to like there's a lot of these stocks that are public and I'm just curious if >> Revlons are public. No. Is Revlon public? >> I don't know if Revlon's public. >> I think Revlon's public. So, Revlon. >> Okay. So, that that So, so like if you had to name a couple brands you really interact with >> a lot. >> All right. 11. Are you materialistic? >> No. That's the problem. >> That's why because I can't answer that question either because I don't shop anywhere. >> I'm like I shop once every like seven, eight years. And I just >> like clothes, shoes. You're not someone who's like >> I mean, dude, I'm the same. I really I don't shop >> again. I was busy. [laughter] >> That's true.

So, we we're going to get her on the Robin Hood app so that she can actually >> I don't I don't think I can because Canadian Yeah, we don't have that. >> Got to get her in Canada, folks. Gotta get her in Canada. >> Okay, so I think uh I think we'll wrap up here, but again, this was an introduction stream. Um I mean you guys will see her here and there potentially on the channel. Um you know we might do this again in the future but realistically this was just to introduce you guys to her. Someone said amit um I think someone said at the top I want to get in contact for the thing. So here's the email that his official email putting in the chat. Jesskcoms.com that is her official email. with me. We'll discuss. >> Yeah. For the people. I think early on I missed the comment, but someone was saying that you want to get in contact in particular for the podcast thing. If there's any big requests, any business things, any like media things, opportunities, that's the email. I also have a new email as well, which is just emit acoms.com. But this should be the official email if you want to get in contact. AK Media was taken. I couldn't get AK Media. There was some someone out there took AK media and I did not have the capital to actually get AK media from them. So AK comms was left. >> Comms is fresh. >> Comms is fresh. >> Yes. Clean. >> So yeah, if you want to get in contact, uh those are the emails. New York meetup. Again, I will I'll be making sure people have access to this link, but here it is right there in the chat.

>> 我认为她不了解。>> 不。好吧。所以，她不应该……你不应该关心那个。所以，我们肯定会把她变成一个整天盯着K线图的人，>> 让她对市场感到兴奋。但，不，我喜欢这样，因为就像>> 投资社区一旦你闻到它的味道，你就会变得有点着迷。>> 我们这里的所有人都有过那种时刻，你知道吗？也许你也有过，也许你没有，但>> 我知道你对这个概念很兴奋。>> 嗯，我来这里是有原因的。 [笑声] 所以，是的，绝对。>> 是的。所以，我认为那会很令人兴奋。>> 让我来做预测。>> 是的，我们还需要让你参与预测市场。顺便说一句，伙计们，我大约30分钟前采访了一个人。那次采访下周会出来，但可以说，他们在大公司工作。不是Vlad，是别人。我认为你们会喜欢的。嗯，我们谈论了一些预测市场，所以下周也会出来。嗯，最喜欢的电影。这是一个好问题。>> 最喜欢的电影？《吉屋出租》（Rent）。>> 经典之作。>> 是的。《吉屋出租》。绝对。>> 这是部很棒的电影。>> 我有DVD版。>> 真的吗？>> 是的。>> 你……你喜欢到拥有它？>> 哦，是的。>> 这是经典。>> 这是部很棒的电影。我真的很喜欢那个男人……>> 做那个动作的部分。>> 做那个动作？>> 是的。太棒了。是的。>> 是的。电影中的关键时刻。然后他付不起房租，对吧？>> 不。>> 这就是为什么他必须工作。>> 然后他们唱着如何支付。>> 正是如此。然后他们变成了一部音乐剧，>> 然后……>> 然后就有了今天。>> 我喜欢音乐剧。>> 我也喜欢音乐剧。>> 好了。>> 我喜欢音乐剧。我不在乎这是否意味着我……>> 好的。她还没看过《Rounders》。所以你不是一个电影迷。>> 不。>> 这是另一件完美的事情。>> 我当时忙着喝酒。 [笑声] >> 我没时间。>> 好的。那么，让我们……>> 优先事项。>> 让我们深入探讨一下。8岁时如何接触到酒精？>> 好的，你和父母一起去度假，然后你遇到一个正在喝酒的人。我最喜欢的东西是任何蓝莓口味的东西。我简直会把它吃光。我看到一个女孩拿着一杯蓝莓冰沙，我问她那是什么。她说：“这是‘蓝山’。”我说：“成交。去吧台。”我向酒保要了一杯‘蓝山’，他每天给我调七八杯。 [笑声] >> 伙计，我们太老了，不能做这种……>> 没关系。我快不行了。 [笑声] 然后，嗯，我喝了一周，我到处昏睡。我……他们把椅子放在一起，因为我睁不开眼。我问我妈妈，拜托，你知道，我们坐高尔夫球车回房间吧。她说：“起来。我来开高尔夫球车。”这是什么？所以， [笑声] 最后一天，我问我妈妈：“我能再来一杯‘蓝山’再上路吗？”我妈妈喜欢甜食。所以，最后，她尝了一口。她的眼睛……我吓坏了。更不用说酒保们即将听到什么了。我知道那对我来说就是结束了。结果是那种蓝色的卡拉克利口酒加朗姆酒，>> 和碎冰，>> 我还是个小孩子，>> 所以，>> 它基本上创造了一种潜意识的……>> 对酒精的渴望，对吧？>> 正是如此。然后之后，尤其是在希腊家庭里，有很多夜生活，有很多聚会都涉及酒精。所以，那时就变成了，“嗯，她可以喝一杯葡萄酒，”>> 对吧？>> 损害已经造成了， [笑声] >> 对吧？嗯，然后是的，我对酒精产生了浓厚的兴趣，我每天喝一瓶龙舌兰酒，然后接着喝半瓶到一瓶葡萄酒。嗯，这持续了10年。这10年里，我每天都像第一天一样。我试图……今天我不喝酒。今天我不喝酒。今天我不喝酒。然后我终于真的戒了。我别无选择。要么是那样，要么是……>> 别的东西，更糟。>> 是的。我认为……我认为人们>> 我认为人们可以理解这一点，如果你……如果你经历过酗酒的路线。对我来说，这很有趣，因为我从小就接触很多酒精，因为我爸爸开酒铺，但他不喝酒。我妈妈也不喝酒。所以我从来没有真正喝过酒。但……但我可以想象，8岁时，你在一个有趣的度假村，潜意识里，你……因为我们都有在很小的时候发生的事情，最终形成了我们……就像我小时候，我……我会开玩笑，我妈妈会笑，所以那告诉我我注定要成为一名喜剧演员。所以现在我每天都能在人们面前讲笑话。所以，就像，再次，潜意识地创造了基础。>> 是的。但这确实是真实存在的。所以，好吧，每天一瓶龙舌兰酒，同时你还在一家高管管理职位上。>> 你是如何最终告诉自己该戒酒的？>> 嗯，就像我说的，这已经酝酿了10年。嗯，我身体里就知道。我的身体感觉像电池酸。我……是的，我……那是那天我和酒瓶搏斗的那天，因为那时我不是用杯子喝的。所以，>> 我把酒瓶放在地上，我捡起来，我来回地拿着它，我真的感觉到我的骨子里，我想，如果我现在喝了它，那就完了。所以我挣扎了很多。我哭了很多，然后我把酒瓶扔到地上。我叫了辆优步。我去了医生那里，我说：“你要给我开药，否则我会自己找。”嗯，我开始服用一些SSRI（选择性血清素再摄取抑制剂），只是为了稍微缓解一下。嗯，然后我终于慢慢地戒掉了它们，我现在是“生扛”着。>> 是的。我是说，伙计，我非常尊重一个能经历那种旅程和任何成瘾的人。你知道，酒精显然是一种更具侵略性的成瘾，但>> 一旦你摆脱了它，就像获得了新生。所以，好吧，你已经两年没喝酒了。那是什么样的经历？你从中获得了什么清晰度？>> 清晰度正在显现。我将在4月份满两年。嗯，前六个月真的就是崩溃，我动不了。我没洗澡。我一个月洗一次澡，即使那样也很难。我真的无法照顾自己。但我只是……我信任我的神圣女性特质，我知道最糟糕的已经过去了。我需要熬过那个时期。我生活中有很多事情，很多不确定性。我一个人住。我……>> 独立生活。独立生活。嗯，我记得我妈妈有一天看着我，她看起来非常担心，我告诉她，我说，相信我，我知道我现在看起来怎么样，但一年后，我会变成一个完全不同的人，相信我，一切都会好起来的。没有人想看到自己的孩子经历这些。没有人想看到自己的孩子处于那种状态。所以她……>> 她相信我，但她非常害怕，我完全理解。然后，慢慢地，清晰度开始出现。我真的崩溃了。我不得不彻底……崩溃，真正触及了谷底。感受到了我从未感受过的深度。感受到了我以为永远不会感受到的高度，并学会了如何与这些情绪共处。学会了如何与它们共存。嗯，这也让我看到了我的行为。我的行为，不仅仅是在人际关系中，或者和朋友或家人在一起，甚至在工作中，也许不是有毒行为，但我一直有巨大的焦虑。酒精一直在压抑焦虑。它让我能够处理焦虑。>> 所以，看到……我的意思是，我与人沟通不多。我不是……你知道，我说的话并不是我真正感受到的。现在我真正这样生活，它为我打开了一个全新的宇宙，我……我有点喜欢它。>> 有人说这太完美了。我刚醒来，宿醉得厉害。 [笑声] >> 我的天哪，>> 伙计。我们第一次见面时，我以为我们要……开会，然后去喝酒，然后她就告诉我这个，我说：“好吧，我们不喝酒了，那不行。”>> 不。 [笑声] 但>> 但只是因为我不能玩得开心，不代表其他人也不能。我仍然会出去。这是我当时觉得很奇怪的另一件事。在公关行业工作，参加活动，有一个在夜生活圈的叔叔，有很多很酷的家人，他们喜欢玩得开心，你知道，我怎么能……停止我的生活？我在各种场合都在酒吧里长大。我……我一直与夜生活有关。所以当我戒酒后，我想，我到底该做什么？嗯，我开始写作，我开始去酒吧，人们看着我，心想你在做什么？你这是在为失败做准备。现实是，我对我的故事非常坦诚，我对我的现状也非常坦诚。我一走进任何场所，我都会清楚地告诉别人：我是个酒鬼。我想来这里享受一下。在任何情况下，我都不想让自己处于可能不小心喝到东西的境地。里面会有酒精。而且，这也让我保持警惕。>> 是的。因为现在有成千上万的人知道这是我的故事，如果他们看到我处于某种……你知道，这真的……这是责任感，是掌控你的生活，然后……坚持下去。>> 是的。看，我喜欢这种……我喜欢这种……这种真实、坦诚的故事，就像……真正定义一个人的故事。尤其是……你看，我不是一个拥有很多员工的大公司。所以，要找一个人来……我过去四年一直很独立。我学会了如何建立品牌，如何投资，如何管理在线社区，你知道，实际上是靠我自己的。没有现成的剧本。所以，如果我要找一个人加入社区，我想要一个经历过真正……你知道，并且足够诚实，不怕讲出自己的故事，足够脆弱，能够接受……这是一个你正在不断进步的过程，并且足够感激……因为你经历了那段旅程，你现在知道……不被困在那个阶段是什么感觉。>> 正是如此。>> 因为我们都曾被困在某个阶段。>> 而且现在这是一个奇怪的时期。每个人都很奇怪。一切都很奇怪。你知道，我们需要……有点给自己一些宽容。我觉得，你知道，就……就接受它吧。因为，你知道，人们也经常告诉我，当我开始谈论我的故事，解释我的处境时，他们说：“你知道，你不应该这么直言不讳，因为人们会评判你。”我说：“伙计，他们反正都会评判我。”所以，>> 人们每天早上都评判我。我的意思是，我……>> 试图讲些笑话，今天没成功。>> 没成功>> 但就像>> 你为什么这么认为？>> 嗯，这是一个更深层次的哲学对话。但>> 不，我看到笑话确实奏效了。有些人笑了，但大多数人可能是在嘲笑我，而不是和我一起笑。但没关系，因为>> 笑声就是笑声。>> 笑声就是笑声。笑声确实是笑声。Triple V，感谢你的到来。感谢你的200美元超级聊天。嗯，我可能几周或一个月后会见到 Triple V。Jessica 也许会见到他。你认识 TripleB 吗？>> 好的，>> 我现在正在认识这个社区。是的，实时认识。>> 你会……你会喜欢他的。他是个很棒的人。嗯>> 我很兴奋。>> Steve，感谢你的超级聊天。欢迎 Jessica。希望一切顺利。>> 谢谢。>> Spencer 说：“Jess 是个辣妹。”>> 谢谢，Spencer。 [笑声] >> 然后 Matt，感谢你的超级聊天。她能让你准时出现吗？>> 我会尽力而为。你可以监督我。就像，伙计，直播前的最后几分钟，这是不可能的。所以，是的，我们会努力看看能做什么。嗯，诗歌。你喜欢……所以，你喜欢写作吗？>> 嗯，你喜欢阅读吗？小说，非小说？你想写小说还是非小说？你怎么看待这项工作？>>
