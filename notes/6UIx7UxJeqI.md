### 能源转型的核心矛盾

**Tyler Rosen**: 你可以将世界划分为传统能源和替代能源。**传统能源**（如天然气和煤炭）的好处是它们能提供 24/7 全天候的可靠能量，但遗憾的是，它们的排放特征不符合我们的要求。**替代能源**（如风能和太阳能）拥有我们想要的排放特征，但它们是间歇性和多变的。如果你是一位**数据中心**的 CEO，你现在会对业务感到非常乐观，但你可能会因为担心停电而在深夜惊醒。你绝对不能断电。你拥有昂贵的金属外壳，需要为服务器降温并提供电力，这意味着你无法承受能源的间歇性，必须使用**基荷能源**。**核能**是唯一能同时满足这两个要求的资源：它 24/7 全天候运行，可变成本低，容量因子极高，而且非常清洁。

**Tyler Rosen**: You break the world into traditional and alternative. Good thing about traditional, so things like natural gas and coal, is it's reliable 24/7 365 energy. Unfortunately, it has the emissions profile we don't like. Alternatives, let's just call it wind and solar, has the emissions profile we want, but it's intermittent and variable. You know, if you're a data center CEO, you're feeling pretty good about your business today. You kind of wake up with night sweats about the power going out, right? You cannot lose power. You have a very expensive metal shell that's cooling servers and providing electricity and energy which means hey, I can't take the intermittency. I've got to use the base load. Nuclear is sort of the one resource that can kind of serve both masters. It is 24/7 365 low variable cost very high capacity factor and it's also pretty clean.

### AI 硬件效率与基础设施风险

**Joe Weisenthal**: 欢迎收看新一期的 **Odd Lots** 播客。我是 Joe Weisenthal。

**Tracy Alloway**: 我是 Tracy Alloway。

**Joe Weisenthal**: Tracy，我今天早上看到一个有趣的头条。**黄仁勋（Jensen Huang）**在 **CES** 大会上提到，未来的芯片效率会越来越高，可能不需要像现在这样密集的冷却基础设施或设备。这导致一些冷却行业的领头羊，比如 **Trane Technologies**，股价遭到了重创。我们知道这些公司一直是 AI 浪潮中的大赢家。

**Tracy Alloway**: 我都能听到那些买了 HVAC（暖通空调）资产的私募股权机构在尖叫了。这确实是个有趣的头条，因为 AI 虽然是技术领域，但它有着巨大的**基础设施**属性。基础设施投资者通常喜欢相对稳定的回报，但由于现在基础设施与科技挂钩，似乎存在很大的风险：每隔一两年，甚至几个月，就可能出现一次巨大的技术升级，彻底改变整个局面。

**Joe Weisenthal**: Hello and welcome to another episode of the Odd Lots podcast. I'm Joe Weisenthal.

**Tracy Alloway**: And I'm Tracy Alloway.

**Joe Weisenthal**: Tracy, I saw an interesting headline this morning. There was this comment from Jensen Huang. He was at a conference, the CES conference, and he was talking about how in the future, I guess, their chips are getting more efficient as chips tend to do that they may not as need as much intense cooling infrastructure or cooling equipment for future data centers. And a bunch of those cooling names like Trane Technologies, they're like really getting clobbered because we know those have been like some of the big winners from the AI boom.

**Tracy Alloway**: I can hear all the private equity shops that bought HVAC outfit screaming from over here. No, it is a really interesting headline, right? Because you think about this as a technology space. AI is technology, but it has this huge infrastructure aspect attached to it. Infrastructure investors from what I understand, you know, historically have tended to like relatively stable returns, right? You invest in it because you expect this to be a pretty reliable business, but because you have infrastructure that is now tied to tech, it seems like there's a pretty big risk that like every year or every two years or maybe even months now, there's going to be some huge tech upgrade that just changes the equation entirely.

### 物理世界的回归

**Joe Weisenthal**: 没错。以前听基础设施投资，通常是买收费公路或机场，这些业务非常稳定，不容易被颠覆。但现在与科技挂钩后，不确定性大大增加了。而且大家都在讨论 AI 的估值，这种建设是否超前了？这些公司能否产生足够的现金流来支撑投资？

**Tracy Alloway**: 还有一个主题在不断重复：现在想要赚钱，你真的得“弄脏双手”。自新冠疫情以来，各种**物理实体**一直摆在我们面前，由于大量公共资金涌入，这一趋势正在加速。物理世界似乎成了我们这个时代的主旋律。

**Joe Weisenthal**: 让我们请出今天的嘉宾，他在这个领域有丰富的经验。**Tyler Rosen**，他是 **Cohen & Steers** 的全球上市基础设施和自然资源股票投资组合经理。Tyler，欢迎来到节目。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: That's a good point. Like I think like the first time years and years ago I started hearing about infrastructure investing, it was like, oh, we bought a toll road, right? Or we bought an airport. Airports by and large they don't get disrupted very much. But yeah to your point especially now that there's such a link with tech just like the sort of volatility of what's going to win out or what's needed seems highly uncertain.

**Tracy Alloway**: Yeah, and of course the other obvious thing going on at the moment is everyone's talking about AI valuations. Is the buildout getting ahead of itself and are all these companies actually going to be able to generate enough cash flow that backs up all this investment spend? One of the themes that's recurring over and over again these days is just like to make money it feels like you really have to get your hands dirty. Physical things of all sorts and physical things have been in our face constantly since COVID. Like this is just sort of the physical world is sort of like the story of our time.

**Joe Weisenthal**: Let's bring in our guest. Well, we really do have the perfect guest who long lots of experience in this realm. We are going to be speaking with Tyler Rosen. He's a portfolio manager, global listed infrastructure and natural resource equities at Cohen & Steers.

### 基础设施投资的新旧交替

**Tyler Rosen**: 谢谢邀请。**Cohen & Steers** 是一家只做多头的资产管理公司，主要投资于**实物资产**。我负责全球上市基础设施和自然资源策略。基础设施涵盖了通信（基站、数据中心、卫星）、公用事业（电、气、水、可再生能源）、交通（收费公路、机场、港口、铁路）以及能源中游（管道）。

**Joe Weisenthal**: 过去一两年你有多忙？

**Tyler Rosen**: 非常忙。我以前常开玩笑说我投资的都是“旧经济”，但现在这些成了“新经济”，是人们最兴奋的东西。这些趋势我们已经观察了十年，但直到过去 18 个月才真正登上**彭博社**的头条。我们看到了传统公用事业、核能、可再生能源和管道领域的大量新机会。

**Tracy Alloway**: 现在的权力平衡是怎样的？数据中心的能源需求巨大，需要海量资本，但投资者也急于入场。

**Tyler Rosen**: 在硬资产经济中，资本非常重要。但现在的投资需求如此之大，以至于给公司带来了挑战。以公用事业为例，18 个月前，如果公用事业的资本支出和盈利增长加速，投资者会很高兴。但现在，投资规模已经大到引发了**可负担性**问题。有些公用事业公司会因为电费账单成为选举焦点而陷入困境，而另一些公司如果能将数据中心引入其服务区，反而能降低居民电费。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tyler Rosen**: Thanks for having me. Cohen & Steers, we're a long-only asset manager. We primarily invest in real assets. Where I help is our global listed infrastructure and our natural resource equity strategies. Infrastructure is communications things like cell towers, data centers and satellites; utilities, this is electric, gas, water, renewables; transportation, the toll roads, airports, marine ports and freight rails; and then energy is midstream pipelines.

**Joe Weisenthal**: So how busy have you been over the past year or two?

**Tyler Rosen**: It's been very busy. I mean my joke used to be that I invest in all the old economy stuff. Uh now it's like the new economy stuff and it's the stuff that people are really excited about. They've really only surfaced kind of to the front page of Bloomberg every morning in the last 18 months. We see investment cases in traditional utilities, tons of new alternatives, nuclear, renewables, pipelines.

**Tracy Alloway**: And what's the balance of power actually like between investors and the companies that need investment at the moment?

**Tyler Rosen**: We're now at a place in the cycle where the investment needs are so big that it's creating pretty big challenges for companies. Take the utility sector as an example. We've gone to such a level now that it's really causing affordability problems and some utilities we think are really going to struggle because elections are being won about utility bills. Other utilities on the other hand actually you invite data centers into your service territory and it lowers bills.

</details>

### 数据中心如何降低电费？

**Joe Weisenthal**: 数据中心能降低电费？这听起来可不会在网上疯传。这是怎么回事？

**Tyler Rosen**: 这非常微妙。公用事业的商业模式是投资于**费率基数（Rate Base）**。假设他们的费率基数是 100 亿美元，允许的股本回报率是 10%，他们赚 10 亿美元。然后他们将成本分摊给客户。如果你翻倍费率基数但不增加客户，成本就会翻倍。但在某些地区，公用事业公司拥有过剩的发电能力，每个纳税人都在为未使用的电力付钱。如果引入数据中心消耗这些电力，普通纳税人的月度账单负担反而会减轻。

**Tracy Alloway**: 这种模式在所有地方都可行吗？

**Tyler Rosen**: 并非如此。这取决于发电能力、水资源和监管环境。在威斯康星州，数据中心运营商同意为公用事业公司的资本支出提供回报保证，从而对当地纳税人产生零影响。但在其他地方，如果公用事业公司花费数十亿确保电力供应，而数据中心五年后搬走了，大家就会面临**搁置资产（Stranded Asset）**风险。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Hey, just real quickly, data centers lowering bills. What's that all about?

**Tyler Rosen**: It's very nuanced. The utility invests in its rate base. Let's say their rate base is $10 billion. They're allowed a return on equity. Maybe it's 10%. They earn a billion dollars. Then they charge their cost to customers. You double your rate base. If you don't increase your customers, you could actually double your costs. There are some utilities that are long power. Every ratepayer is paying for power that's not actually being used. Bring a data center into that service territory, the data center itself might consume that power and you as the ratepayer are not actually going to be burdened by that cost in your monthly bill.

**Tracy Alloway**: But how feasible is it that you could get a data center that could actually in some way improve the electricity market in a particular state or location?

**Tyler Rosen**: We're not saying it's good everywhere. I'd say it's really actually bad in a lot of places and then it's really good in some places. You could have big stranded asset risk. Utility is going to spend a couple billion dollars. Maybe the data center leaves five years from now and then everybody's going to be stuck with a stranded asset.

### 进入“稀缺时代”

**Joe Weisenthal**: 像 **Caterpillar** 这样的公司，以前被认为是典型的周期性公司，但现在似乎成了长期赢家。这种观念是什么时候开始转变的？

**Tyler Rosen**: 自然资源领域长期缺乏资本投入，导致许多行业进行了大规模整合。我们已经从“丰饶时代”进入了“**稀缺时代**”。我们没有足够的资源来支撑经济增长，而能够解决这种稀缺性的公司变少了。这种长期增长和波动性的降低，使得现在的环境与十年前截然不同。

**Tracy Alloway**: 基础设施和能源领域经常会出现产能过剩，你怎么避免这一点？

**Tyler Rosen**: 无法完全避免，周期总会发生。但基础设施资产通常具有**垄断性**，无论是通过监管还是竞争格局。例如美国的货运铁路，你无法再造一条。虽然会有过度建设的情况（如 2010 年代的页岩油管道），但作为投资者，我们的工作是识别市场预期何时过于激进。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: At what point did it sort of dawn on you that a lot of companies that we had long associated with being sort of classically cyclical companies are secular winners now? I'm thinking of like a Caterpillar.

**Tyler Rosen**: One of the things that we believe about natural resources is that we've exited what we talked about as the era of abundance and we've entered the era of scarcity. You know, we just don't have enough of all the stuff that we need for the economy to grow. And the companies that actually facilitate ending that scarcity, there's just not as many of them because again there's been massive consolidation in these sectors.

**Tracy Alloway**: How do you guard against the possibility that we always end up with overcapacity at some point in the cycle?

**Tyler Rosen**: Can't avoid it. That will happen. Although infrastructure again it's generally assets that are monopolistic either by regulation or by competitive dynamic. You think about the US freight rails, you can't really build a new one.

### 全球能源需求的数学逻辑

**Joe Weisenthal**: 谈谈 2026 年 1 月的现状。现在的数学逻辑是怎样的？

**Tyler Rosen**: 让我们从全球视角来看。全球能源需求模型主要由三个因素驱动：**人口增长**、**经济规模**和**能源强度**（将能源投入转化为经济产出的效率）。虽然人口增长在放缓，但 2040 年的人口仍将多于 2024 年。即使我们假设能源效率大幅提升，全球能源需求也将从 17.8 万太瓦时增长到 2040 年的 22 万太瓦时。这相当于在未来 16 年内，重新创造一个已经存在了 100 年的全球原油产业。

**Tracy Alloway**: 那些大型云服务商（Hyperscalers）的脱碳倡议进展如何？

**Tyler Rosen**: 五年前，能源的优先级是：清洁、稳定、充足。今天，顺序变成了：**充足、稳定、清洁**。我们不能为了清洁而牺牲充足和稳定。因此，我们看到云服务商正在重新工业化核能经济，投资 **SMR（小型模块化反应堆）**，并将煤炭转向天然气。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Tell us about right now, January 2026. What is the math that you see out there?

**Tyler Rosen**: Global energy demand is kind of three factors: global population growth, the global economy, and the energy intensity of economic growth. What we saw was global energy demand rising from about 178,000 terawatt hours to 220,000 in 2040. That's basically recreating the entire global crude oil industry that's been around for 100 years in the next 16.

**Tracy Alloway**: Can you talk about the decarbonization initiatives from some of the hyperscalers?

**Tyler Rosen**: Five years ago it was clean, stable, more in that order. Today, it's kind of flipped, right? We need more. It has to be stable. And then we do want it to be clean. Hyperscalers who have a lot of cash, let's try to re-industrialize the nuclear economy. Let's continue to make investments in SMRs.

### 核能复兴的四个阶段

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我对美国的**核能复兴**持怀疑态度。除了佐治亚州的 **Vogtle** 电站，未来 20 年还会再有新的核电站吗？

**Tyler Rosen**: 我不同意你的看法。核能是唯一能同时满足 24/7 可靠性和清洁要求的资源。核能复兴分为四个阶段：
1. **停止关闭**：我们正处于这一阶段的尾声，不再关闭现有的核电站。
2. **重启**：重启最近关闭的设施，如 **三哩岛（Three Mile Island）**。
3. **棕地扩建**：在现有核电站围墙内增建设施，预计 2032-2035 年投产。
4. **新一代技术**：SMR 和钍反应堆，预计 2035-2040 年实现。

**Joe Weisenthal**: 会有公用事业公司独立承担新核电站的建设吗？

**Tyler Rosen**: 可能性为零。没有任何公司愿意承担成本超支风险。这需要政府的直接干预。如果我是“能源沙皇”，我会让美国政府为 10 座核电站提供成本超支担保。即使纳税人最终承担了 500 亿美元的损失，我们也换来了 10 个提供廉价清洁能源的新发电机组。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I think I'm very skeptical that we're going to have a nuclear renaissance in the US. I don't think there's going to be another Vogtle in the next 20 years.

**Tyler Rosen**: Phase one is let's just not shut it down. Phase two is can we turn on any of the stuff that we recently turned off? Turning on Three Mile Island. Phase three would be the sort of brownfield inside the fence nuclear facility buildout. That's like a 2032 to 2035 in service. And then we talk about SMRs, that's like 2035 to 2040.

**Joe Weisenthal**: Will we get another Vogtle?

**Tyler Rosen**: No utility will do it themselves. There is zero chance that a utility will say, \"Hey, we're willing to do a green field new nuclear facility with no cost overrun risk.\" But I think the cost overrun risk will get covered by the government.

### 寻找“铲子”与“牛仔裤”

**Tracy Alloway**: 为什么市场信号在铜或铀等资源上不起作用？

**Tyler Rosen**: 投资者仍然在惩罚那些增加资本支出和供应的公司。他们想要**纪律**。页岩油在 2010 到 2020 年间摧毁了大量价值，所以投资者现在说“不要再增加了”。这意味着供应响应不会自然发生，必须依靠政府作为催化剂。

**Joe Weisenthal**: 在这个电力受限的故事中，哪里还有未被充分发掘的机会？

**Tyler Rosen**: 某些**公用事业公司**。目前增长最快的公用事业公司的市盈率溢价仅为 6%，而它们的增长率比平均水平高出 2%。此外，还有那些为数据中心和再工业化提供支持的“**锄头和铲子**”类公司，比如大型基础设施建设的工程公司。就像淘金热中，赚到钱的是卖 **Levi's** 牛仔裤和铲子的公司。

**Tracy Alloway**: 这种波动性如何评估？比如去年 CME 发生的数据中心断电事故。

**Tyler Rosen**: 运营风险是巨大的。如果你拥有的管道发生泄漏，那就是大问题。我们会深入现场，不只是和 CEO 谈，还要和工厂经理谈，了解资产的维护情况。在基础设施领域，运营失误会导致重大的资产减值。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Why doesn't the market signal work for something like uranium or copper?

**Tyler Rosen**: Companies are still being penalized for increasing capex and increasing supply. They want the discipline. Shale destroyed a lot of value 2010 to 2020. It's not going to happen naturally. That's why I think that the government is going to try to get it moving.

**Joe Weisenthal**: What parts of this energy story to you still feel underappreciated?

**Tyler Rosen**: Certain utilities. Today, the fastest growing utilities only trade 6% more expensive, but they're going to grow 2% more. Outside that, the picks and shovels types companies to the data center and re-industrialization buildout. Who made all the money in the gold rush? It was the Levis and the picks and shovels companies.

### 从 NIMBY 到 BANANAS

**Joe Weisenthal**: 现在的监管环境如何？我们听到了很多关于数据中心的当地抵制。

**Tyler Rosen**: 十年前是 **NIMBY**（不要在我家后院），后来演变成了 **BANANAS**（Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anything，绝不在任何地方建设任何东西）。数据中心并不创造很多长期就业岗位，却可能推高当地电费，这自然会引发监管机构的反应。

**Joe Weisenthal**: 这是一个迷人的领域。Tyler Rosen，非常感谢你参加我们的节目。

**Tracy Alloway**: 谢谢。

**Joe Weisenthal**: 感觉如果你现在站在正确的位置，就会有源源不断的资金涌入。每个国家都想要能源安全，这种长期趋势是不可阻挡的。

**Tracy Alloway**: 但政府和监管仍然是核心风险。即使现在的商品价格和需求看起来很合理，但谁知道十年后钟摆是否会摆回另一边？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tyler Rosen**: A decade ago, we had a NIMBY world. That world transitioned to a BANANAS world. BANANAS is Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anything. There's been a lot of data center backlash. It doesn't create any jobs in the local market and you're not really doing a lot for the local economy.

**Joe Weisenthal**: That was a great conversation. Tyler Rosen, thank you so much for coming on Odd Lots.

**Tracy Alloway**: It feels to me the government is the key risk here, the regulatory risk. Even though maybe the numbers pencil out at current commodity levels, in another 10 years the pendulum will swing back.
