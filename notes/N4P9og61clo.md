### 德尔·托罗的《科学怪人》情结

**[吉尔莫·德尔·托罗]**: 并不完全是。我已经拍了 13 部电影，写过或合写过 42 个剧本。所以我非常清楚一个事实：我永远无法拍出所有我本可以拍出的电影。这次的情况很复杂，因为我想要一种**宏大的规模**，我想要设定在 19 世纪，我希望它宏伟、奢华且具有**歌剧感**。这些词汇和概念听起来都不像是好莱坞的大片。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Guillermo del Toro]**: Not really. I have done 13 movies and I have written or co-written 42. So I'm very wellversed with the fact that I'm never going to get to make the movies I could have made. So and this was complicated because I I wanted I knew I wanted to make Imperial. I kn I knew I wanted to make it uh the 19th century and I knew I wanted to make it big and lavish and and oporatic. None of these words and none of these notions sound like a Hollywood blockbuster.

**[吉尔伯特·克鲁兹]**: 我是吉尔伯特·克鲁兹。这是《纽约时报》的**《书评》**节目。在今天的节目中，我们邀请到了**吉尔莫·德尔·托罗**。吉尔莫是一位曾三次获得奥斯卡奖的导演。今年，他因改编**玛丽·雪莱**的《科学怪人》而获得提名。这部经典小说讲述了科学家**维克多·弗兰肯斯坦**、他创造的怪物以及随之而来的诸多悲剧。多年来我一直是德尔·托罗作品的粉丝，从他的处女作《魔鬼银爪》到《刀锋战士2》、《潘神的迷宫》、《水形物语》，他是融合恐惧与泪水的大师，擅长创造既恐怖又极具美感的怪物。他的新片《科学怪人》也不例外。毫不夸张地说，这部电影是他一生心血的结晶。这是他从小就痴迷的故事。他 7 岁时看了 1931 年的经典电影版，11 岁时第一次读了原著。当我们交谈时，我请他带我回到那个时刻。

**[Gilbert Cruz]**: I'm Gilbert Cruz. This is the book review from the New York Times. And on today's episode, it's Guiermo Del Toro. GMO is a threetime Oscar-winning director. And this year he's nominated for his adaptation of Mary Shel's Frankenstein. That is the classic novel which tells the tale of scientist Victor Frankenstein, the monster that he creates and the many tragedies that ensue. I've been a fan of Del Toro's work for years. From Kronos, his very first movie, through titles like Blade 2, Pan's Labyrinth, Shape of Water, he is a master of mixing scares and tears, and at making monsters that are both terrifying and absolutely gorgeous to look at. His new movie, Frankenstein, is no exception. It is not an exaggeration to say that this film is the culmination of his life's work. It's a story that he has been obsessed with since he was a child. He was 7 years old when he saw the classic 1931 film version. He was only 11 when he read the book for the first time. And when we talked, I asked him to take me back to that moment.

### 童年、孤独与怪物的共鸣

**[吉尔伯特·克鲁兹]**: 告诉我，你是怎么得到那本书的？请告诉我整个故事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Gilbert Cruz]**: Tell me, how did you get a copy of the book? Tell just tell me the whole story.

</details>

**[吉尔莫·德尔·托罗]**: 我以前常去家附近的一家超市，在那里你可以买到所有美国外派杂志和来自西班牙的平装书。我会去那里买恐怖书籍和恐怖杂志，比如**《电影界的著名怪物》**（Famous Monsters of Filmland）。11 岁那年，我骑着自行车去那家店，买了一本西班牙出版社出版的平装书，那是 **1818 年版的文本**。对我来说，在玛丽·雪莱生前修订的三个版本中，这是唯一的版本，也是最纯粹的版本。它有点缺乏约束，有点笨拙，有点执迷不悟，但它绝对是最接近玛丽·雪莱传记脉搏和她**本我**（Id）的版本。我读了它，我一直觉得：那个怪物就是我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Guillermo del Toro]**: You know, I used to go to a supermarket near my home where I uh you would get all the expat American magazines and paperbacks from Spain and I would I would shop for horror uh uh books there and uh for horror magazines like Famous Monsters of Filmland. And at that age, at 11, I pedal my bicycle to to to that store and I bought the paperback uh from a a Spanish a Spanish um publisher and that was the 1818 text um which is for me the only text uh the only version of the three versions that exist of the novel that were revised during Mary Shel's life. The 1818 is the most pure for me. is a little undisiplined, is a little ungainainely, uh is a little unrepentant, but is absolutely the one closest to the pulse of the biography of Mary Shel, the id of Mary Shel. And I read it and I I what I always felt is the creature is me.

</details>

**[吉尔伯特·克鲁兹]**: 在那个年纪，怪物身上的什么特质如此强烈地触动了你？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Gilbert Cruz]**: What was it about the creature at that early age that spoke to you in in such a strong way?

</details>

**[吉尔莫·德尔·托罗]**: 我深信，你在进入青春期之前所经历的恐惧深度，是你一生中能感受到的最深刻的恐惧。成年后的每一次恐惧、愤怒或狂暴，其实都是那个年幼的孩子在控制你，那种被遗弃的感觉，或者对未来和世界的忧虑。至少对我这个在天主教环境下长大的人来说，最深刻的问题是——我部分是由我的姑奶奶带大的，我管她叫祖母——她会告诉我：“听着，无论如何你都要在**炼狱**里待上几百年，因为你有**原罪**。” 我当时想，这简直就像是针对灵魂的**分时度假**骗局。天主教中充满了这种华丽而野蛮的仪式感。11 岁时，我对世界的问题非常深刻，《科学怪人》这本书缩小了这些问题的规模：为什么世界会如此野蛮？为什么世界会如此残酷？我们为什么能以一种至今难以解释的方式互相残杀？这就是为什么他是一个**奇点**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Guillermo del Toro]**: I I I really believe that uh the the depth of of fear that you experience before you get into your teenage years uh is the most profound fear you will ever uh feel in your life. And every every time you are afraid or angry or full of rage as an adult is that very young child controlling you, feeling abandoned or feeling apprehensive about the future or the world. the the deepest questions at least me being raised Catholic, you know, I was raised by partially by my great aunt who I called my grandmother and she would tell me, "Look, you're going to go to purgatory no matter what for hundreds of years because of original sin." And I and I thought this is like time share but for the soul, you know, this is a a complete scam. you know there there's such a pageantry such a savagery to Catholicism and uh at 11 the questions I had about the world were very profound and and and Frankenstein uh the book downsized a lot of these questions uh the questions why the world can be savage why the world can be cruel why how can we be cruel to each other in in a way that is even now hard to explain that's why he's a singularity.

</details>

**[吉尔伯特·克鲁兹]**: 观看你的电影并重读原著（我自青少年时期起就没读过了），也许是因为我年纪大了，那种**孤独感**对我来说特别突出。11 岁的我可能没有你那么老练，当时没看出来。他真的太孤独了，世界上只有他一个这样的生物。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Gilbert Cruz]**: Watching your movie and revisiting the book, which I hadn't read since I was a teenager. Now, I don't know if it's just cuz I'm older, but the loneliness of it was really underscored for me. And I was able possibly in a way I wasn't as sophisticated as you as an 11year-old that I didn't see when I was younger. It's just he is so lonely. He is the only one of himself out there.

</details>

**[吉尔莫·德尔·托罗]**: 我相信玛丽·雪莱本人也是如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Guillermo del Toro]**: And I believe that was Mary Shel.

</details>

**[吉尔伯特·克鲁兹]**: 怎么说？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Gilbert Cruz]**: How how so?

</details>

**[吉尔莫·德尔·托罗]**: 我认为玛丽·雪莱在社会赋予她的性别角色中感到不自在。她继承了她母亲的精神，那也是一个对世界充满渴望的自由灵魂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Guillermo del Toro]**: I don't think Mary Shelley felt comfortable in the gender that she was uh put in by society. I think she had uh the spirit of her mother which was also uh a free spirit of great hunger for the world.

</details>

**[吉尔伯特·克鲁兹]**: 女权主义作家**玛丽·沃斯通克拉夫特**（Mary Wollstonecraft）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Gilbert Cruz]**: The feminist writer Mary Walencraft.

</details>

**[吉尔莫·德尔·托罗]**: 是的。她活得恣意、狂野而美丽。但在她父亲**威廉·戈德温**（William Godwin）眼中，玛丽的出生基本上害死了她母亲。事实上，玛丽是在她母亲的墓碑上学会阅读的。那种令人窒息的感觉——没有母亲，某种程度上也没有父亲，孤独地活在这个世界上。我认为这就是关键。我 11 岁时感到如此孤独，充满了想要付出的爱，也充满了无处宣泄的愤怒。对于那么小的孩子来说，这是一种非常复杂的情感范畴。有些人通过《圣经》来表达他们的信仰和存在，而我是在这本书里找到的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Guillermo del Toro]**: Yes. and and and you know she she had lived uh large and wild and beautifully and then basically in the eyes of her father William Goodwin Mary kills her and and in fact teaches her to read on the gravestone of her mother you know the sort of crushing feeling for her that she is motherless and somewhat fatherless that she's alone in the world and that I think that's the key for me I felt so alone at age 11 and so full of um love to give and so full of rage to dispose of. It was a very a very complicated emotional scope for somebody that young and and this you know some people find in the Bible the way to articulate their faith and their existence. I found it in this book

</details>

### 父亲、图书馆与认知的觉醒

**[吉尔伯特·克鲁兹]**: 引用一句可能不太恰当的话，罗伯特·德尼罗在《烈火雄心》里说：“我是一个人，但我并不孤独。” 当你还是个孩子的时候，你是独自一人，还是感到孤独，或者两者兼有？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Gilbert Cruz]**: to quote maybe inappropriately Robert Dairo on heat when he says I am alone I am not lonely when you were a kid were you alone or were you lonely or was it both?

</details>

**[吉尔莫·德尔·托罗]**: 我想我当时非常孤独。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Guillermo del Toro]**: I think I was very lonely.

</details>

**[吉尔伯特·克鲁兹]**: 为什么呢？你有这位姑奶奶，还有其他家人，这种感觉从何而来？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Gilbert Cruz]**: And why was that? You had this aunt or this great aunt. You had other family members but where did that come from?

</details>

**[吉尔莫·德尔·托罗]**: 我认为这取决于你如何内省这个世界，你把它放在哪里，如何分类，以及它如何影响你。如果你**过度共情**，如果你把别人的痛苦记在心里，你成长过程中的性情就会变得更加阴郁、更加忧郁。我当时非常敏感，我敏锐地察觉到成年人告诉你的世界观其实并不真实。我看到了谎言，看到了虚伪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Guillermo del Toro]**: I think the way you introspect the world uh and where you put it and how do you shel it and and and how it affects you. If you are overempathic, if you are if you are um if you take the suffering of others to heart and uh you you grow up with a much more somber, much more melancholic disposition, you know, and I I was definitely resonant and I was very attuned to the to the way adults told you the way the the world was uh not being truthful. you know the I saw the lies um I saw the the falsehoods.

</details>

**[吉尔伯特·克鲁兹]**: 你能回想起某个时刻吗？也许是关于宗教，或者是别的什么，一个你信任的成年人告诉你一件事，然后你心想：“抱歉朋友，这不是真的，我能看出来，你为什么要骗我？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Gilbert Cruz]**: Can you recall a moment where maybe it was religion, maybe it was something else where someone an adult who you trusted told you a thing and then you were like that is that sorry my friend that is not true like I can tell I can see it why are you lying to me?

</details>

**[吉尔莫·德尔·托罗]**: 是的。正如你在我的电影中可以非常尖锐地看到的，这一切始于我的父亲。1969 年我父亲中了彩票，然后他变了，变了很多。并不是说他犯了大错，我说的是一些细微的差别。从各方面来看，他都是个好人，但他所说的和所做的并不一致。我问过他，他说：“一码归一码。” 这太绝了。我说：“爸爸，你怎么能这么虔诚？你是**主业会**（Opus Dei）的成员，结果你却表现成这样？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Guillermo del Toro]**: Yeah. No. Well, it as very pointedly you can see on my movies, it started with my father. You know, my father uh you know, my father won the lottery in 1969 and he changed. He changed quite a bit. And it's not that he was at great fault. Uh I'm talking about nuances. you know, he was by all accounts and by all experience a good man, but he was not very consistent with what he said and what he did. And and I did ask him and he said, "One thing doesn't have to do anything with the other, which which was marvelous." I said, "Father, Dad, how can you be so Catholic? Uh you're part of the oppos, you know, and then you behave like this."

</details>

**[吉尔莫·德尔·托罗]**: 他说：“慈善是一回事。” 对他来说，慈善是教会里的一个概念。你在教会里捐钱，那就是慈善。但对同胞的仁慈完全是另一回事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Guillermo del Toro]**: And he said, "Well, one thing doesn't have to do charity." For him, charity existed as a notion in the church. You know, you gave money in the church and that was charity. But charity to your fellow human beings was another matter matter altogether.

</details>

### 悖论、宗教与道家智慧

**[吉尔伯特·克鲁兹]**: 随着年龄增长，这是否让你觉得世界非黑即白？还是你理解了人本身就是充满矛盾的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Gilbert Cruz]**: Did that make you see the world as you got older as more black and white or did you did you understand that that people people are contradictory as much as anything?

</details>

**[吉尔莫·德尔·托罗]**: 我其实很喜欢世界并非恒久不变的黑或白这个事实。我认为黑与白通过灰色流转，这种理解是非常令人解脱的，这就是宇宙的本质——**阴阳**不断旋转，永无止境。没有什么事是永恒的。这非常好。我不喜欢的是那些虚伪的措辞。世界的本质并不像成年人对世界的宣言那样让我困惑。当你意识到世界的本质就是**悖论**时，我们存在于一种悖论的状态中，任何我们想要变得永久、安全、好或坏的东西，都只是灵魂的一场无理取闹。这就是我从小在**《约伯记》**中找到的答案，当约伯问上帝：“为什么是我？为什么会这样？” 上帝给他的回答是：“为什么不是呢？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Guillermo del Toro]**: I actually love the fact that the world is not is neither black nor white in a constant way. I I think the flow the flow of the black and the white with through the gray is so liberating to understand that that's the nature of the universe is the ying and the yang revolving constantly and never ending. You know, nothing is permanent. That is really good. And what I didn't like was the the inconsistent way in which it's phrased. The nature of the world puzzled me less than the declarations the adults made about what the world was, you know. Yeah. Uh I think when you when you realize the entire nature of the world is the paradox uh we exist in a paradoxical state and anything we want to become permanent or safe or good or bad quote unquote uh is a tantrum a tantrum of the soul. Uh and that's that's the answer that I found at a at an early age on the book of Job when Job says to God why me? Why this? And the answer God gives him is why not

</details>

**[吉尔莫·德尔·托罗]**: 在那么小的年纪发现这一点真的很了不起。我是在**耶稣会**学校长大的，我们有精神导师，我成长过程中与几位神父关系很好。我向他们提出了这些问题。我非常迫切地想讨论《约伯记》。他只是说：“上帝创造世界的方式是我们不需要理解的。” 这并不能让我满意。后来我在**《道德经》**中找到了更多答案。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Guillermo del Toro]**: you know it's it's really really you know uh phenomenal to find that at an early age and and and I did I was I was raised in in Jesuit school. Mhm. So uh we had a spiritual counselor and I was very close to several priests growing up. So I I I asked these questions of them. I really I really asked the questions of uh my my ethic and spiritual advisor in Jesuit school. I said I wanted to discuss the book of Job so urgently. He just said well God made the world in you know in a world in a way that we don't have to understand. And I I I that didn't satisfy me. I I I I I found more answers later on in the Dao, you know, as a younger man.

</details>

**[吉尔伯特·克鲁兹]**: 那个神父的表现似乎有点欠缺。我也上过耶稣会大学，耶稣会士本该比这更聪明。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Gilbert Cruz]**: And the fact that seems that seems deficient on that priest's part. I mean, you know, I went to a Jesuit college. The Jesuits are supposed to be smarter than this.

</details>

**[吉尔莫·德尔·托罗]**: 关于“道”，最棒的一点是它的表述更美。它说：“妄用大师工具的人，必将伤及自身。” 那些不是你可以驾驭的工具。我理解创造世界的工具，也理解世界为何充满悖论。你结婚庆祝的那天，可能正是某人被车撞的日子，是某人失去儿子的日子，也是某人生下女儿的日子。这就是世界的本质。通过这种表述，我更容易理解。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Guillermo del Toro]**: They they they they you know, the the great thing about the Dao, he it phrases it very much more beautifully. He says, "He who tries to use the tools of the master basically will cut himself." You know, uh they are not tools that you can handle. And and I understand the tools that make the world and and and that make the world that uh so full of paradox. The day you marry and are and celebrate is the day somebody got run over by a car. Is the day somebody lost a son? Is the day somebody gave birth to a daughter? I mean that's the nature of the world. And I understand that easier through through that phrasing.

</details>

### 剧本创作：浪漫主义与语言的节奏

**[吉尔伯特·克鲁兹]**: 让我们谈谈剧本。谈谈你刚开始写这个剧本的第一天。第一场戏是什么？是关于结构、角色还是对话？你是如何开始的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Gilbert Cruz]**: Let's talk a little bit about that screenplay. Talk to me about when you first started, you literally the first day you started writing this. What was the first scene? Was it about structure? Was it a character? Was it dialogue? How did you start?

</details>

**[吉尔莫·德尔·托罗]**: 我确实是从头开始的，因为我想展示怪物对船只的一次非常暴力的袭击。我希望观众说：“我以前从未见过这个。” 觉得这个生物是恐怖、可憎且野蛮的。但我知道在看完整个电影后，你会理解。你会回到那个时刻并意识到，哦，这就是暴力发生的原因。我希望到电影结束时你能理解另一面。我还想为维克多创造一种近乎虚构的童年，他已经是一个相当糟糕的“妈宝男”了，因为他觉得自己受了委屈，觉得世界欠他的。我们现在处于一个可以看到许多最有权势的人都是**“巨婴”**的时代，他们觉得世界欠他们一些东西，而我们所有人都在为此付出代价。我觉得这非常有生命力，就像玛丽·雪莱出版小说时那样充满生命力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Guillermo del Toro]**: The first thing I I I I did start with the beginning because I wanted to I wanted I knew I wanted to show a very violent attack of the creature to the ship and I wanted the audience to say, "Well, I had never seen this before." Uh and and to find the creature monstrous and reprehensible and savage. And then I knew after going through the whole movie, you would understand. You would come back to that moment and realize, oh, that's why that violence occurred. So you would understand the other side at the end of the movie. That was my hope. And then I knew I wanted to create this sort of um almost imaginary childhood for Victor in which he was already quite an atrocious mama's boy, you know. And and because he felt slighted. Uh he would feel the old the world owed him. We are now in an era in which we can see many of the most powerful men are manchildren that feel the world owes them something that we are all paying for you know and I felt that was that felt very alive. I wanted it to feel alive in the way that the novel felt alive when Mary Shelley published it.

</details>

**[吉尔莫·德尔·托罗]**: 在改编过程中，我知道**浪漫主义者**（Romantics）是现代的。这些人带着佩剑去打仗，在滑铁卢驰骋，当他们举行独奏会时，他们是魔鬼的工具，点燃年轻心灵的激情，让死亡与爱融合在一起。所有这些想法开始渗透，我想要涵盖浪漫主义精神、随之而来的孤独感、毁灭感、希望以及**墓园诗歌**（Graveyard Poetry）的意境。所以当我开始这部电影的宣传时，我说我唯一渴望的提名就是**最佳改编剧本**，因为我已经写了几十年了，而这是我最引以为傲的剧本。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Guillermo del Toro]**: you know, it felt as of as of now. Uh, modern loomed very large. And as I went into the adaptation, I I I knew the romantics were and are modern. These were people that took the savor and went to war and galloped through Waterlue and and when they gave recital, they were the the tool of the devil. uh inflaming passions in young hearts and uh being in favor of death and love being fused into one. All of these things started to percolate and I and I I wanted to encompass the romantic spirit and the and the loneliness that comes with it and the doom the sense of doom and hope and uh that comes with it and the sense of graveyard poetry that comes with it. So all these things occupied my mind and that's why when we got when we started this campaign for this movie I said the only nomination that I really desire is best adapted screenplay because it I have written so much uh for decades and this is the screenplay I'm the proudest of.

</details>

**[吉尔伯特·克鲁兹]**: 你说这是你最自豪的剧本。你为所有的电影都写过剧本，而且正如你所说，你还有更多没能拍出来的剧本。告诉我为什么你对这一个如此自豪？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Gilbert Cruz]**: You um said this is the screenplay that you are most proud of. you have written screenplays for all of your films and as you said you've you've written many more that have gone unproduced. Just tell me why you're so proud of this one.

</details>

**[吉尔莫·德尔·托罗]**: 我发现人们往往认为自己了解这本书，这在那些伟大的角色身上经常发生。人们认为自己了解匹诺曹、德古拉、科学怪人、基督山伯爵。但使这些书成为经典的机制却被他们忽略了。我想做的一件事是，我知道我要生成 90% 的新对话，但我希望它与原著浑然一体。为了学习，我阅读了大量 1800 年代的信件，那种语言有一种特定的方言、韵律和风格，需要很长时间才能浓缩出来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Guillermo del Toro]**: One of one of the things I found uh people that think they know the book and that's an illusion that happens often with those characters that are so large. People think they know Pinocchio. People think they know Dracula. People think they know Frankenstein. People think they know Monte Cristo. But the mechanics that made the books what they are uh escaped them. I think that uh one of the things I wanted to do was to I knew I was going to generate 90% new dialogue. Uh but I wanted to feel of a piece with the book. So to learn I read for example volumes of letters from the nu 1800s there's a ptoa and a cadence and a and and and and a a a style to the language that takes quite a while to to try to condense

</details>

**[吉尔莫·德尔·托罗]**: 作为一个以拉丁语系为母语的人，我的节奏通常是非常悠长且有旋律感的。而英语往往非常具有**冲击性**（Percussive）。现代英语肯定有海明威那种“哒哒哒”的节奏。西班牙语的一整段话在英语里可能只需要四个词。19 世纪的对话是两者的结合。没有人会说：“能给我一片吐司吗？” 他们会说：“我犹豫着是否该开口，但如果不麻烦的话，我能否享用一片您的吐司？” 这种表达既有一种试探性的古雅，又非常清晰。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Guillermo del Toro]**: Uh I have I've been a screenplay writer for about 30 years and uh the rhythms I have as a native speaker which come from Latin languages, right? Are very are very um melodic and long. Uh uh English tends to be very percussive, you know. A modern English certainly has the ratat of Hemingway. You know, a a whole paragraph in Spanish can be said in English in four words. You know, it's is very concussive. It's very percussive. It's very rhythmic. And 19th century um uh dialogue is a mixture of both. You know, it has a certain rhythm, you know. Nobody says, "Can I have a piece of toast?" They they would say, "I hesitate to ask, but if it wouldn't be too much trouble, may I partake of a piece of your toast?" In a way.

</details>

### 结局的重塑：从虚无到恩典

**[吉尔伯特·克鲁兹]**: 我想问问关于结局。玛丽·雪莱原著的结局非常荒凉。船长进入船舱，发现怪物站在弗兰肯斯坦冰冷的尸体旁。而在你的版本中，他们进行了一次交流。弗兰肯斯坦和他创造的生物交谈，有宽恕，有理解，有和解。为什么你觉得这是你这个版本故事最真实的结局？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Gilbert Cruz]**: but I want to ask you about the ending here, right? If we're talking about adaptation, if we're talking about, as you put in another interview, transmutation, you know, the ending of Shel's book is quite stark. The captain uh of the ship enters his cabin. He discovers the creature standing over Frankenstein's lifeless body. In your version, they have an exchange. Frankenstein and his creature, Frankenstein and the thing he created um talk and there's forgiveness, there's understanding, there's a reconciliation. Um why did you feel like that was the truest way for your version of the story to end?

</details>

**[吉尔莫·德尔·托罗]**: 在我看来，在浪漫主义时代，最激进的做法是以一种近乎**原始存在主义**的方式结束。原著中怪物被洋流带向远方的虚无，那是一种非常美丽的**虚无主义**（Nihilism）。但在我看来，现在的激进立场是**“恩典”**（Grace）。我们倾向于认为宽恕是很复杂的，但我认为宽恕实际上就是恩典。我们渴望宽恕，也渴望被宽恕，这是我们内心深处的渴望。我决定重新诠释我作为父亲和作为儿子的经历。电影以日出开始，船长背对着阳光；以怪物面对太阳并接受它结束。这与雪莱描绘的结局是不同的洋流，但我觉得，如果我要唱这首歌，我要用我自己的声音。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Guillermo del Toro]**: In my in my opinion, the the dialogue that occurs in the cabin in this version is a dialogue that occurs in the eyes between the creature and Victor, you know, earlier in the book. uh where he tells him, look, this is what happened to me. And uh to me, the radical thing to do in the romantic times was to end up in a almost protoexistentialist way. in which the creature is born by the current and the distance into nothing. You know, uh that is a very uh a beautiful nailism nailism, you know. It's like a a very powerful uh very very counter to what was invogue in the world, you know. um therefore very anarctic and and to me right now the radical position uh is grace you know uh and the fact that uh we tend to believe that forgiveness is very elaborate but I think forgiveness is actually grace we want to forgive and we want to be forgiven we really long for And uh and I think that's the radical position for me. Now uh one of the things I decided very much so is if I have fused through the decades with the spirit of the book and how autobiographical it was for Mary Shel I believe to write this book. It was all her rephrasing her life. I decided I would rephrase my experience as a father and my experience as a son. And the ending has a very strong tie with my own life, you know, and uh and that is to accept the grace and the rhythms of the world to accept, you know, the movie starts with the sun rising and the captain turning his back to it and it ends with the creature facing the sun and accepting it. abandon him himself to to that current. It's a different current than the current that Shel portrayed in the ending, but it felt like look, if I am to sing this song, I'll sing it with my voice.

**[吉尔伯特·克鲁兹]**: 我记得在戛纳电影节，当温·德斯（Wim Wenders）首映《完美的日子》时，他说过类似“善良是新的朋克摇滚”或“温柔是新的朋克摇滚”这样的话。在这样的时代，激进的做法实际上是友善、仁慈和宽恕。

**[Gilbert Cruz]**: You know, at the um I think it was at Ken uh when they premiered Sentimental Value, Wim Trier said something like kindness is the new punk rock or tenderness is the new punk rock. You also saw it in Last Summer Superman. The idea that in times like these actually the radical thing is to be nice, is to be kind, is to forgive. Yeah. Is to forge some sort of understanding between people.

**[吉尔莫·德尔·托罗]**: 我想我几年前就说过“情感是新的朋克”。我坚持这一点，因为：无知中的恩典和希望没有价值。但在了解世界的真相、了解世界有多糟糕之后，依然选择恩典和希望，这才是激进的。你不是出于无知而这样做，你是作为一个对世界的“良心拒止者”而这样做。

**[Guillermo del Toro]**: I think I I think I I I preeded it a few years ago saying emotion is the new punk and and and I I sustain it because here's the thing. Grace and hope in ignorance have no value. But grace and hope with the knowledge of the world and how it is is radical. Uh you are not doing it out of ignorance. You're doing it as a conscientious objector to the world, you know, and and I think then they have a different uh weight and gravity.

### “买书”环节：影响导演的书单

**[吉尔伯特·克鲁兹]**: 吉尔莫，你送过或收到的最好的书是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Gilbert Cruz]**: Um what is the best book that you've ever either received or given as a gift?

</details>

**[吉尔莫·德尔·托罗]**: 我会说是史蒂芬·米切尔翻译的**《道德经》**。这是我发现并喜欢送人的书之一。另一本好书叫**《艺术家的侘寂》**（Wabi-Sabi for Artists）。至于收到的，几乎没人敢送我书。但我会说有一本非常好的书叫**《纳博科夫的蝴蝶》**（Nabokov's Butterflies），这是一本杂记集。纳博科夫对昆虫学，尤其是蝴蝶非常着迷，书里收集了一些非常吸引人的零散文章。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Guillermo del Toro]**: I would say the the Dao in the translation of Stephen Mitchell uh is one of is one of the books I I love to I discovered and I love to give and uh another great book I think it's called Wabby Sabi for artists you know I love to give that uh that I have received um I think um that almost nobody dares to buy me books but uh I would I would say I would say there's a really good book that is called Navok's butterflies which is is a collection of miscellaneia and I think Nabokov uh had a fascination with entomology and uh uh you know particularly fascinated by butterflies, but it collects loose loose uh pieces that I find very compelling, a lot more compelling than than his uh organized studies of literature, for example.

**[吉尔伯特·克鲁兹]**: 有没有哪部经典小说是你最近才发现或第一次读完的？

**[Gilbert Cruz]**: Are there any classic novels that you only just recently discovered or read for the first time?

**[吉尔莫·德尔·托罗]**: 作为一个年轻读者，我很难读完**《白鲸记》**（Moby Dick）。当你年轻时读到那些关于捕鲸过程的章节，我会觉得完全迷失了。但最近，几年前，我读完了它，那些捕鲸的段落反而成了我的最爱。我意识到作为一个读者，你会发生多大的变化。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Guillermo del Toro]**: As a young reader, I have difficulty finishing movie. [Moby Dick] Whenever whenever you hit the whailing passages as a young reader, I said, "Well, I I would be completely shipwrecked in that." And now uh like recently, you know, like a few years ago, I finished it and the whailing passages became my favorite. And uh and uh and I I I realize how much you change as a as a reader.

**[吉尔伯特·克鲁兹]**: 有没有哪本书是你觉得永远不该被改编成电影，或者永远不该再被改编的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Gilbert Cruz]**: Is there one book that you would be okay with never being adapted into film or never being adapted again into film?

</details>

**[吉尔莫·德尔·托罗]**: 我认为**雷·布拉德伯里**（Ray Bradbury）的作品非常难改编，但回报很高。他的风格会误导你，让你觉得是可以模仿的。他使用形容词的方式极具启发性。当你是一个年轻作家时，你会说：“我要按他的风格写。” 没错，祝你好运。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Guillermo del Toro]**: I think a guy that is very hard to adapt but very rewarding is really Bradbury. Bradbury his style is fools you as something you can past. you know, he's he he he the way he uses adjectives in an evocative way seems to be something that you can do, quote unquote, you can, you know, and when you're a young writer, you say, well, I'm going to write in the style of, yeah, sure.

**[吉尔伯特·克鲁兹]**: 最后一个问题。你第一次看的或者你记得看过的第一部电影，真的是劳伦斯·奥利弗版的**《呼啸山庄》**吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Gilbert Cruz]**: I have to ask this question. I is it true that the first movie that you ever saw or that you recall seeing was the Lawrence Olivier version of Weathering Heights?

</details>

**[吉尔莫·德尔·托罗]**: 100% 准确。我记得是在市中心的一家电影院和我母亲一起看的，那家电影院现在已经变成停车场了。我记得我在母亲腿上睡着了，醒来时看到荒原上一场非常戏剧性的暴风雨。我想是那部电影成就了今天的我。所以，我的“怪物”现在成了雅各布·艾洛蒂饰演的希斯克利夫，这对我来说是一个完美的圆满。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[Guillermo del Toro]**: 100%. Believe it or not is full circle for me because I saw it with my mother in in a cinema downtown that is now a parking lot. Uh-huh. Uh and and and uh I remember falling there's something very victory childhood. I fell asleep on my mother's lap and I woke up to a storm, you know, in the moors or something very dramatic and uh and and I think it made me who I am. So the fact that the creature is is now in eyes is in the best word synthetically uh powerful.
