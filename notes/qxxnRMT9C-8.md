title: 睡眠专家马修·沃克：颠覆你对睡眠的认知——从“睡眠银行”到基因编辑的未来
summary: 世界知名睡眠专家马修·沃克教授分享了关于睡眠科学的最新研究成果，颠覆了许多传统观念。他指出，大多数镁补充剂对睡眠无效，而“蓝光有害”也是一个误区。本期内容深入探讨了“睡眠银行”这一新概念，即通过提前多睡来为未来的睡眠不足做准备。沃克教授还提出了改善睡眠的四大宏观指标（QQRT）：数量、质量、规律性和时机，并强调规律性比睡眠时长更能预测寿命。此外，他还揭示了REM睡眠在情绪疗愈和激发创造力方面的关键作用，并介绍了新型助眠药物的原理以及基因编辑可能带来的反乌托邦未来。

### 镁补充剂与睡眠的真相
关于通过补充镁来改善睡眠，存在一个问题。首先需要注意的是，大多数形式的镁无法穿过血脑屏障，而睡眠是由你的大脑产生的。那么，一种无法进入大脑的物质，又如何能影响大脑的活动呢？你所做的，很可能只是在制造昂贵的尿液。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's the problem with magnesium supplementation when it comes to sleep. The first thing to note is that most forms of magnesium don't cross the brain barrier and sleep is produced by your brain. So, how can something that doesn't get into your brain affect brain process? All you're doing is creating probably expensive urine.</p>
</details>

然而，确实有一种形式的镁似乎有一些证据支持其功效，我们可以稍后讨论。但事情不止于此，我们还有很多新的证据，包括关于“8小时睡眠”的迷思、我对于给孩子服用**褪黑素**（Melatonin: 一种调节生物钟的激素，能向大脑和身体发出夜晚来临的信号）的担忧、为什么你总在半夜醒来，以及第一类我个人比较推崇的新型安眠药的发明，而大多数人对此并不了解。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, there is one form of magnesium that seems to have some evidence in favor of it which we can speak about. But it doesn't stop there. There's so much new evidence that we have including this myth of 8 hours. my fear about giving melatonin to kids. Why you keep waking up in the middle of the night and the invention of the first new class of sleeping medication that I actually favor and most people are not aware of it.</p>
</details>

马修·沃克回来了，这位世界知名的睡眠专家和神经科学教授将分享全新的研究成果，以对抗睡眠缺失的流行病，并帮助你获得完美的夜间睡眠。社会上，我们因多种原因在夜间难以入睡，但却没人教我们这些知识。比如，你可能一晚11点睡觉，第二天凌晨1点，再下一晚又变成了晚上10点半。令人惊讶的是，很多人都这样做。但研究表明，与那些作息最规律的人相比，你的过早死亡风险在统计上要高出49%。更糟糕的是，他们的心血管代谢疾病风险增加了57%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Matthew Walker is back and the worldrenowned sleep expert and neuroscience professor is sharing brand new research to combat the sleep loss epidemic and help you get the perfect night's sleep. So society, we have struggles with sleep at night due to many reasons, but no one teaches us this stuff. And it's things like say you go to bed at 11:00 one night, 1:00 a.m. the next night, then 10:30 p.m. the next night. And it's remarkable how many people do this, but studies have shown that you are statistically 49% more likely to prematurely die versus those people who were most regular in terms of going to bed and waking up at the same time. And worse, they had a 57% cardioabolic disease risk increase.</p>
</details>

科学确实告诉我们，良好睡眠有四大支柱。此外，还有一项关于“睡眠银行”的惊人新研究。这对于那些面临工作冲刺、即将连续值班40小时的医生，或是新手父母来说，都意义非凡。我们可以深入探讨所有这些内容。但如果你非要我总结出三件今晚就能开始做、最有影响力的事来改善睡眠，那会是……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The science really teaches us that there are four pillars of good sleep. And then there's this incredible new study looking at sleep banking. And this is remarkable for people who are facing a sprint at work or a medical doctor about to go on call for the next 40 hours, new parent. And we can go through all of that. But if you were to push me to say the three most impactful things that you can start doing tonight to start sleeping better, it would be...</p>

### 睡眠科学家的使命
我是一名神经科学家，但我的专业是睡眠，研究睡眠对大脑和身体的影响。在过去的大约二十年里，我一直在试图理解我们究竟为什么需要睡觉。因为在50年前，对于“你为什么睡觉”这个问题的粗略回答是：你睡觉是为了消除困意。这在逻辑上等同于说“你吃饭是为了消除饥饿感”，这显然是荒谬的。你吃饭不是为了消除饥饿，而是为了支持各种生理和生物学上的益处。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I am a neuroscientist by trade, but my specialty is sleep. the effects of sleep on the brain and the body. And I've probably spent about the past two decades trying to understand exactly why do we sleep? Because 50 years ago, the crass answer to the question, why do you sleep was the following? You sleep to cure sleepiness, which is the factous equivalent of saying, well, you eat to cure hunger. No, you don't eat to cure cure hunger. you eat to support all sorts of physiological and biological benefits.</p>
</details>

但现在，这并非我个人的研究成果，而是得益于所有我所敬仰的杰出同行的努力，我们不得不颠覆这个问题。我们现在要问的是：你身体里有哪个主要的生理系统，或者你大脑的哪项功能，不会因为获得充足睡眠而得到极大的增强，或者在睡眠不足时不会受到明显的损害？现在的答案似乎是“没有”。不存在这样的系统。甚至在你的DNA层面，你的睡眠状况也会改变构成你日常健康叙事的DNA核酸字母表。我们可以看到这种影响一直延伸到社会层面。睡眠可以改变社会结构，改变我们与他人的互动方式，甚至可以改变我们的信仰体系，影响我们是感到孤独还是过度社交。所以，回答你的问题，我是一名睡眠科学家，我的使命一直是努力让全人类重新获得他们似乎严重缺失的睡眠。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But now, and this is not due to my research, is this all of the incredible colleagues whose sort of shoulders that I stand on, we've now had to upend the question. We now have to ask, is there any major physiological system in your body or is there any operation of your mind that isn't wonderfully enhanced by sleep when you get it or demonstrabably impaired when you don't get enough? And the answer now seems to be no. There is no such system. Even down to the level of your DNA, your sleep and how you are sleeping or not sleeping will change the very DNA nucleic alphabet that spells out your daily health narrative. And we can see it all the way up to society. Sleep can change the fabric of society, can change how we interact with other people. It can change our belief systems. can change how lonely or sort of hypersocial we are. So to your question, I'm a sleep scientist by trade and I suppose my mission has been trying to reunite humanity with the aleep that it seems to be so bereft of.</p>
</details>

### 睡眠的进化悖论与社会偏见
从进化的角度来看，睡觉是一个非常愚蠢的想法。因为当你睡觉时，你不能寻找伴侣、不能繁殖、不能照顾后代、不能觅食，最糟糕的是，你还容易受到捕食者的攻击。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">From an evolutionary perspective, it is such an idiotic idea to sleep because when you're sleeping, you're not finding a mate, you're not reproducing, you're not caring for your young, you're not foraging for food, and worst of all, you're vulnerable to predation.</p>
</details>

基于以上任何一点，尤其是综合来看，睡眠本应在进化过程中被强烈地淘汰掉。我的观点是，人们常说，如果睡眠不具备一系列绝对至关重要的功能（注意是复数），那么它就是进化过程中犯下的最大错误。我们现在意识到，进化并没有犯下如此惊人的错误。但我想说的关键是，睡眠并非一种被动状态，无论对大脑还是身体而言，它都是一个极其活跃的状态。所以，你不应该因为过去不重视睡眠而感到自责或羞愧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So on any one of those grounds, and especially all of them as a collective, sleep should have been strongly selected against in the course of evolution. And my point is that, and it's often been said that if sleep doesn't serve an absolutely vital set of functions plural, then it's the biggest mistake the evolutionary process has ever made. And we now realize it didn't make a spectacular blunder. But really, I guess to the point of it is sleep is not a passive state. It's an incredibly active state both in the terms of the brain and the body. And so you should not feel sort of you know remiss or ashamed that you didn't value the importance of sleep.</p>
</details>

首先，从主观感受上，你只会觉得“我的大脑离线了一会儿”。其次，我们都知道，教育体系中并未教授睡眠的重要性。就连医生自己，一项出色的研究发现，在全球约11个不同的医学课程中，医生们平均只接受了约1.2小时的睡眠教育，而睡眠占据了他们病人生命的三分之一。因此，一系列因素几乎形成了完美的风暴，让社会对睡眠的重要性和价值一无所知。我认为这就是我们常常轻视它的原因，再加上一种可怕的社会偏见。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because firstly as a subjective sense you just think well my mind was offline for a while. Second we also know that we don't teach the importance of sleep in education and doctors themselves you know there's a great study and they what they found was that medical doctors across I think it was about 11 different curricula around the world they will only receive about 1.2 two hours of education on sleep, but it's a third of their patients lives. So there's a collection of sort of almost perfect storms that have happened to keep society ignorant of the importance and the value of sleep. I think that's why we often so short change it together with also something terrible which is stigma.</p>
</details>

人们很自豪地说：“我过去几个月吃得很健康”，或者“我过去一年每周都坚持去健身房三次”。但从来没有人会公开宣称：“我每晚都坚持睡足8个半小时”。因为如果你这么说，人们会用一种略带锋芒的语气回应：“真的吗？”这种语气的潜台词是，如果你有时间睡觉，那你肯定不忙；如果你不忙，那你肯定不重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that people are so proud to say, well, I've been eating really healthy the past couple of months, or, you know, I've been going to the gym, you know, three times a week consistently for the past year. No one is ever going out into society and saying, you know, I I've been getting 8 and 1/2 hours of sleep consistently every night. Because if you did, people would say, really? And there's a there's a slight edge to the really which is that if you have time to sleep then you must not be busy and if you're not busy you must not be important.</p>
</details>

### 关注睡眠的不同人群
首先，我们有一群患有失眠症的人。还有些人患有其他睡眠障碍，比如我们可以谈谈的睡眠呼吸暂停症。另外还有一种叫做“不宁腿综合征”的可怕疾病，患者的腿部会感到一种爬行感，需要不停地按摩和移动，严重扰乱睡眠。顺便说一句，所有这些疾病的漏诊率都非常高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Firstly, we have the collection of people who have insomnia. Those people who have other sleep disorders like sleep apnoa which we can speak about. There's another disorder called restless leg syndrome. It's a terrible disorder where your legs start to feel as though they've got this sort of creepy crawly feeling and you've constantly got to massage them and move them. It's a terrible disruptor of your sleep. All of these disorders are marketkedly undiagnosed, by the way.</p>
</details>

然后，还有另一群人，他们没有睡眠障碍，但他们的行为却在破坏自己的睡眠。他们可能摄入了酒精、咖啡因、**四氢大麻酚**（THC: 大麻中的主要精神活性化合物）等物质，这些东西并非睡眠的帮手，尽管有时他们会这么认为。此外，还有一些内在因素会妨碍你睡个好觉，比如压力和焦虑。当然，生活本身也可能成为障碍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then you've got another collection of individuals who they don't have any sleep disorders, but they are either doing things that will dismantle their sleep. So, either they're taking on things into themselves like alcohol, caffeine, THC that aren't the sleep helpers, even though sometimes they think they are. And then you've got perhaps the internal things that will prevent you from sleeping well. Things like stress and anxiety. And then you've also just got life itself that can get in the way.</p>
</details>

接着，从有睡眠障碍的人群，过渡到那些没有睡眠障碍但可能在睡眠方面做得“不够好”的人群。再然后，就是那些痴迷于把事情做对的人，他们是生物优化者，也就是所谓的“生物黑客”。此外，我还与许多追求卓越表现的个人合作，他们努力争取那最后百分之几的提升，无论是在商界，还是我们经常合作的职业运动员。对于这些人来说，两到三个百分点的改变可能意味着数千万美元的收益，也可能是在奥运会上站上领奖台与否的区别。所以，这是一个由各种各样精彩人物组成的广泛群体。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then moving from the sleep disorders realm to the I don't have a sleep disorder, but I'm probably not doing it right quote unquote when it comes to sleep. Then you've got the people who are obsessed about getting it right and they are the bio optimizers. this sort of the you know the biohackers and then you've also got I work with a lot of high performance individuals who are really trying to just scratch out those last couple of percentages either if it's in business or often we're working with professional athletes. These are the people for whom two or three percentage point changes can be tens of millions of dollars or they can be the difference between standing on a podium at the Olympics or not. And so there's there's a broad collection of wonderful characters.</p>
</details>

### 睡眠研究新前沿：睡眠银行与补觉的真相
是的，我认为我们掌握了大量的新证据。但或许让我先谈谈中间那部分人群。我过去常说，对于睡眠不足的人来说，睡眠不像银行，你无法累积债务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think there's there's a broad collection of new evidence that we have. But maybe let me come on to the middle group. You know, I used to say that for people who were deficient in their sleep, that sleep wasn't like the bank, that you can't accumulate a debt.</p>
</details>

我们可以看到，这个罐子曾经是满的，装满了睡眠信用，那时你睡得很好。然后，在工作日里，我睡眠不足，可能每晚只睡五个小时。于是，我不断地陷入债务，失去了所有这些宝贵的睡眠信用，我的身体系统也累积了这种附带的债务。我们过去认为睡眠不像银行，一旦你负债，不幸的是，盖子就关上了，即使在周末你试图偿还，也无法再把信用存回系统中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, here we go. Okay. So, what we can see here is that the jar used to be full, full of sleep credit when you're sleeping well. And then during the week, I'm short sleeping. So, maybe I'm only getting five hours a night. So, I'm constantly going into debt. So, I'm losing all of this wonderful sleep credit and my system is building up this collateral debt. And then we used to think that sleep was not like the bank. That once you've gone into debt, unfortunately, the lid is closed and even at the weekend, if you try to pay it back, you can't put back credit into the system.</p>
</details>

然而，一项发表自“英国生物样本库”（UK Biobank）的研究改变了这一看法，这是一个令人难以置信的、具有革命性的数据集。在这篇特定的研究论文中，他们研究了超过9万名个体。他们基本上将这些人分为几组：工作日睡眠不足且周末也睡眠不足的人，以及工作日睡眠不足但在周末睡得久的人，也就是在补觉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, there was a study published from what's called the UK Bioank, which is this incredible data set. It's revolutionary. And they studied in this particular research uh paper over 90,000 individuals. And what they did was they essentially split them down into those individuals who were short sleeping during the week and then short sleeping at the weekend. And they compared them to those individuals who were short sleeping during the week, but then long sleeping at the weekend. They were doing catch-up sleep.</p>
</details>

事实证明，如果你看数据，会发现有非常多的人会采取这种补觉行为。但令人惊讶的是，与那些工作日和周末都睡眠不足的人相比，那些工作日睡眠不足但在周末睡得久的人，其心血管疾病风险降低了20%。需要明确的是，这两组人的心血管疾病风险都高于那些在工作日和周末都睡眠充足的人。所以我并不是说这完全是免费的午餐。但我们第一次意识到，至少你身体里的一个主要器官系统——你的心脏，就像银行一样。在周末，你可以不断地存入信用，你的系统就不会遭受那么大的损失。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's so many individuals. It turns out if you look at the data, it's it's remarkable how many people do this this catch-up sleep behavior. But what was amazing is that in the people who were short sleeping during the week but long sleeping at the weekend, they had a 20% reduced cardiovascular disease risk relative to the people who were short sleeping during the week but also short sleeping at the weekend. Now, to be clear, both of those groups had a higher cardiovascular disease risk than people who were sleeping sufficiently during the week and sleeping sufficiently during the weekend. So, I'm not saying that it's a completely free lunch. But for the first time, we realized that at least one system, major organ system in your body is like the bank, which is that if your heart at the weekend you can just keep putting credit back and your system doesn't suffer as much for your heart.</p>
</details>

但是，许多其他主要的生理系统并没有表现出这种特性。例如，科罗拉多大学博尔德分校的肯尼思·赖特等人的研究表明，你的免疫系统、血糖调节能力以及认知能力，在周末长时间睡眠后并不会反弹。所以，这是我在“睡眠与银行”这个问题上改变看法的一个方面。但还有一组全新的、截然不同的数据，彻底改变了我对这个概念的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But again, many of the other major physiological systems don't show that. So work by people like Kenneth Wright at the University of Boulder, Colorado, he's shown that your immune system doesn't rebound after long sleep at the weekend, your regulation of blood sugar, your cognitive ability. So that's one way in which I've changed my mind regarding sleep in the bank. But there's a very different new set of data that has changed my mind completely about this idea of sleep and the bank.</p>
</details>

我们刚才讨论的是，我先欠下了债，然后希望在周末用信用把它还清。但现在有了这些非凡的新数据。它来自沃尔特·里德陆军医学研究所，一位名叫托马斯·巴尔金的研究员。他感兴趣的是将问题的方向反过来：不是在我负债后能否用信用偿还，而是如果我知道未来将面临一笔债务，一笔即将到来的债务，我能否进行“睡眠银行”操作？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now what we've just discussed here is to say I went into debt and then I was hoping to try and pay it off with credit at the weekend. Now, it turns out you can't do that even if you sleep for as long as you want. But here's this new remarkable data. It came from um Walter Reed Medical Army Institute, a researcher called Thomas Balkan. And what he was interested in was flipping the direction of the question. Not if I go into debt, can I pay back with credit, but what if I know in future I'm going to face a debt, an upcoming debt, can I do sleep banking?</p>
</details>

所以，如果我知道我将要环游世界，睡眠会不足，我可以在此之前多睡一会儿来建立一个……用金融来类比的话，就像是圣诞节快到了，你知道会花很多钱买礼物之类的。所以，在十月和十一月，我会勒紧裤腰带。这样，当我进入圣诞消费期，花钱更多时，我的银行账户就不会受到那么大的冲击。我不会陷入那么严重的债务状况，因为我已经积累了信用。所以，你可以建立睡眠储蓄。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, so if I've got a big thing coming up where I'm traveling across the world and I know I'm going to be sleep deficient, can I sleep a lot before it to create a What would the financial analogy be? The financial analogy would be, let's say that we're coming up to Christmas. And you're going to spend lots on, you know, presents and all sorts of stuff. So, I know that in October and November, I'm going to tighten my financial belt. So that when I go into the sort of Christmas period and I'm spending a lot more money, my bank account isn't hit as hard. I don't go into as much of a sort of a debt situation because I've built up credit. So you can create sleep savings.</p>
</details>

没错，这是一个睡眠储蓄系统。所以，他所做的不仅仅是把罐子装满，而是实际上塞进了更多，以至于你几乎得到了这种美妙的睡眠溢出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Correct. It's a sleepsaving system. So essentially, you know, what he was able to do, not just put the jar to full, but he was actually packing in even more so that you almost got this wonderful overflow of sleep.</p>
</details>

他们所做的是，让这些陆军学员在面临两到三晚完全不睡或睡眠显著减少之前的一周里，将卧床时间从限制的8小时增加到10小时，他们可以想睡多久就睡多久。因此，他们的平均睡眠时间从大约7到7.5小时增加到了大约8.5甚至接近9小时。他们延长了睡眠时间，从而建立了一个缓冲。这几乎就像一个睡眠安全网，当你陷入睡眠剥夺的困境时，你会被支撑起来，因此，在睡眠剥夺的条件下，你所遭受的损害程度会显著降低，前提是你事先储存了睡眠。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what they did is that they woke you up to a period when you're going to have two or three nights of either no sleep or marketked sleep reduction. And in the week beforehand with these army cadetses, instead of being limited to 8 hours of time in bed, they were able to get 10 hours of time in bed and they could sleep all that they want. And so they went from probably an average of about 7 7 and 1/2 hours of sleep to about 8 and 1/2 almost 9 hours of sleep. So they were extending their sleep duration and so that they had built up this buffer. It's almost like a sort of a a sleep safety net that's in place so that when you go into the tumble of sleep deprivation, you're sort of almost bolstered and you're lifted higher and therefore your degree of impermanment that you suffer under conditions of sleep deprivation is significantly less if you banked sleep beforehand.</p>
</details>

与那些只是正常睡眠然后面临睡眠剥夺的人相比，后者的认知和心理表现下降得更厉害。他发现，那些在事前几天、一周内建立起这种信用，这种睡眠储蓄账户的人，他们所遭受的损害比那些没有制定任何储蓄计划的人少了大约40%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">versus those people who were just sleeping normally and then faced the deprivation. they went down much further in terms of their cognitive and mental performance. And what he found was that people who had built up this credit, this savings account of sleep in the days, in the week beforehand, they suffered about 40% less of an impairment relative to the people who had not created any savings plan.</p>
</details>

这对于那些像你所说的人来说是了不起的，比如，如果我工作上要冲刺，或者我是一名医生，知道自己接下来40个小时都要待命。还有军人、飞行员、所有的新手父母。所有这些情况，我们现在都知道，运动员也是一个很好的例子。当我们与运动员合作时，像迈克尔·格兰德纳这样的人已经证明，运动员在重大比赛前一晚通常睡得很糟糕。当然，这是因为紧张。但你可以让他们在不那么紧张的前几天储存睡眠，这样即使他们知道自己会睡眠不足，他们的表现也不会受到太大影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But this is remarkable for people like you were saying who are facing, let's say, if I've got a sprint at work or I'm a medical doctor, I know I'm about to go on call for the next 40 hours. You're a military, aviation, all of the new parents. All of these circumstances are places where now we know athletes is a great example. When we work with a athletes, people like Michael Grner have demonstrated that athletes sleep terribly typically the night before a huge performance. No matter, you know, of course, they're nerves. But what you can do is you can have them bank sleep in the days before when they're not as nervous and therefore their performance doesn't suffer as much even though they know they're going to be deprived.</p>

### 改善睡眠的三大支柱
如果你非要我说出三件今晚就能开始做、最有影响力的事来改善睡眠，那会是以下几点：数字排毒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you were to push me to say what are the three most impactful things that you can start doing tonight to start sleeping better, it would be the following. Digital detox.</p>
</details>

睡前一小时，尽量限制那些会让你兴奋的社交媒体互动、电子邮件和短信。听播客是没问题的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">1 hour before bed, try to limit activating social media engagement, email, and text messages that are going to trigger you. It's fine to listen to a podcast, you know.</p>
</details>

快速说一下，我们一直被灌输一个关于设备蓝光效应的迷思，但这确实是一个迷思。因为一位出色的澳大利亚研究员，迈克尔·格拉迪萨，他几乎凭一己之力改变了曾经的主流看法。此前一篇非常有影响力的论文指出，睡前一小时阅读iPad会损害你的褪黑素，扰乱睡眠，减少梦境睡眠量。甚至在停止阅读iPad后，其对梦境睡眠的冲击波影响还会持续一周。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so it's not a problem of blue light a quick aside we've been taught this myth of the blue light effect from devices and it really is a myth because an incredible Australian researcher a guy called Michael Gradazar has almost singlehandedly changed the the what I think of as being the zeitgeist for a while after a very influential paper which is a great paper and what they showed was that 1 hour of iPad reading before bed ended up impairing your melatonin it disrupted sleep it reduced the amount of dream sleep and even after they stopped reading the iPad the blast radius impact on your dream sleep lasted a week.</p>
</details>

但后来，这位杰出的澳大利亚研究员迈克尔·格拉迪萨开始表示，他无法复制这些发现。他发现，问题不在于蓝光。当然，蓝光会改变褪黑素的某些方面。褪黑素是一种激素，它只是告诉你的大脑和身体何时是夜晚，何时该睡觉。它不参与睡眠的产生过程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But then Michael Gretazar, this incredible Australian researcher started to say, well, I can't replicate these findings. And what he was discovering is that it's not the blue light that's the problem. Now, the blue light will change aspects of your melatonin. And melatonin is a hormone. It simply tells your brain and your body when it's nighttime, when it's time to fall asleep. It doesn't participate in the generation of sleep.</p>
</details>

褪黑素就像百米赛跑的发令员。它把所有赛跑者带到起跑线上，并开始计时，但它不参与比赛本身的创造过程。那是另一组化学物质的作用。如果你看一下我们称之为**荟萃分析**（meta-analyses: 将关于某一主题的所有独立研究汇总并进行统计分析的方法）的结果，你会发现褪黑素只能将你入睡的速度提高约3.4分钟，并将你的睡眠效率提高约2.2%。所以，效果并不比安慰剂好多少。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Melatonin is like the starting official at the 100 meter race. It brings all of the races to the line and it begins the timing of the race, but it doesn't participate in the creation of the race itself. That's a different set of chemicals. It doesn't make you go to sleep. It doesn't make you and if you look at what we call meta analyses where we gather together all of the individual studies on a topic and we put them in a big statistical bucket. What they found is that melatonin will only improve the speed with which you fall asleep by about um 3.4 minutes and it will only increase the efficiency of your sleep by about 2.2%. So not much more than placebo.</p>

### 深入解析：褪黑素、蓝光与其他常见误区
关于褪黑素，要小心，并非越多越好。你可能会冒着让你早晨的大脑陷入浓重的夜间迷雾的风险。我的意思是，10毫克或20毫克的褪黑素是我们所说的“超生理剂量”，这是一个花哨的医学术语，意思是你身体永远不会自然释放如此大量的褪黑素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when it comes to melatonin be careful more isn't always better and you run the risk of confusing your morning brain into a dense nighttime fog. And what I mean by that is 10 milligrams or 20 milligrams of melatonin is what we call a supra physiological dose, which again is just a fancy medical term to say it's a size of magnitude of melatonin that your body would never naturally release. It's far greater.</p>
</details>

褪黑素是黑暗的信号。通常到了早晨，我们自然分泌的褪黑素已经停止，水平降至零。所以你醒来时，身体不再有褪黑素信号告诉你“现在是晚上”。但如果你服用了10或20毫克的褪黑素，你可能会说，“是的，我知道它能让我‘昏睡’过去”。但问题是，在醒来后的头三四个小时里，你会感到非常挣扎，因为你处在一种荷尔蒙迷雾中，褪黑素这种荷尔蒙信号还在说“现在是漆黑的夜晚”。不，外面已经天亮了，但你的身体被误导，以为还是漆黑一片，因为你服用了过高的剂量。难怪你早上需要喝两三杯咖啡。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So melatonin is the signal of darkness. And normally by the morning hours, our natural release of melatonin has stopped and you're down to zero levels again in the morning. So, you wake up and your body no longer has the signal of melatonin saying it's night, it's night, it's night. But if you've dosed yourself with 10 milligs or 20 milligs of melatonin, you run the risk of saying, well, yes, I know it quote unquote knocks me out. But the problem is in the first, you know, 3 or 4 hours of the waking morning, you're struggling because you're in this fog of a hormonal melatonin, a hormonal signal saying it's still pitch black. No, it's not. It's bright light outside, but your body is fooled into thinking it's pitch black because you've dosed yourself too high. And no wonder you're reaching for two or three cups of coffee in the morning.</p>
</details>

那么我应该服用多大剂量的褪黑素呢？大概在0.1到3毫克之间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, what what dose of melatonin should I be taking? Somewhere between probably about 0.1 to 3 millig.</p>
</details>

我建议在两种情况下使用褪黑素。第一种是当你经历时差时，它非常有帮助，但时机至关重要。第二种情况是如果你有**昼夜节律**（Circadian Rhythm: 生物体内约24小时为周期的生理和行为节律，即生物钟）障碍。比如说，你是一个昼夜节律提前的人，这意味着你可能要到凌晨三四点才能感到困意，并且更愿意在白天大部分时间睡觉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, in two conditions. The first or circumstances I should say. The first is when you're going through jet lag. Wonderfully helpful. But timing is critical. The second is if you have a circadian rhythm disorder. Let's say that you're someone who has a an advanced circadian phase. What that means is you're someone who really can't get sleepy until 3 or 4 in the morning and you would prefer to be sleeping throughout most of the day.</p>
</details>

我对此感到担忧，原因有二。首先，在美国的儿科人群中，儿童使用褪黑素的情况正在呈指数级增长。事实上，如果你去美国的超市，通常在健康食品区会有一个大的紫色区域，那就是褪黑素区。其中很大一部分是专门为儿童准备的含褪黑素的软糖。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm cautious about it for two reasons. The first is in pediatric populations here in the United States. Yeah. So the people's use of melatonin in kids is increasing. So in pediatric populations it's increasing exponentially. And in fact, if you go down the sort of the the supermarket aisles here in America, often if you go into sort of the the health sort of food section, there's this big purple section. That's the melatonin section. And a large proportion of that is there dedicated to gummies for your children with melatonin.</p>
</details>

大约三年前发表的一项研究显示，在美国，过去10年里，因褪黑素中毒过量而入院的案例增加了530%。所以首先，我们必须小心一点。第二个原因是，褪黑素是一种具有生物活性的激素，它也参与生殖发育。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there was a study that was published about three years ago that showed here in America over the past 10 years there has been a 53% increase in poisonous overdose admissions to hospitals of melatonin in the past 10 years. 503% increase. So firstly, we've got to be a bit careful. The second reason is that melatonin is a bioactive hormone and it's also involved in reproductive development.</p>
</details>

我们还没有证据表明，如果你持续高剂量服用褪黑素，你的身体会停止自身褪黑素的自然分泌。我没有看到任何这方面的证据。事实上，我看到的证据恰恰相反，即使在服用6个月甚至某些小型研究中的12个月后，当你停止服用褪黑素，身体的自然分泌会重新开始，看起来没有问题。问题是，人们服用褪黑素不仅仅是12个月，他们已经服用了好几年。我们完全不知道几年后会发生什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, we don't have any evidence yet that that's the case that if you keep taking melatonin at high dose, your body, the fear would be shuts down its own natural production of melatonin. I've seen no evidence of that. In fact, I've seen evidence the contrary that even after about 6 months or even 12 months in certain small cities, when you stop melatonin, the production starts again naturally. It seems fine. Problem is, people haven't been taking melatonin for just 12 months. They've been taking it for years. We've got no idea what happens after years.</p>

</details>

回到我们提到的三件事。第一件事是数字排毒，别担心蓝光，而要担心普遍的光线。我稍后会谈到这一点，因为那是第二点。但正如我所说，迈克尔·格拉迪萨发现，蓝光并不会真正扰乱你的睡眠。问题在于，我们使用的这些设备是注意力捕捉设备，它们被设计用来无情地榨取你的注意力经济，而且它们做得非常出色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So to come back to sort of the three things, the first thing we were mentioning is digital detox and don't worry about the blue light. Worry about light in general. I'll come on to that because that's the second. But Michael Gratazar as I was saying what he found is that the blue light doesn't really disrupt your sleep. It's a combination of first these devices that we use are attention capture devices and they are designed to fleece you of your attention economy and they do it ruthlessly well.</p>
</details>

结果发现，这些设备确实是吸引注意力的设备，会抑制你的睡意，但你必须是特定性格类型的人。他发现，并非我们所有人都容易受到设备对睡眠的干扰。你必须是那种可能有些神经质、冲动性高或焦虑程度高的人。如果你属于这些类型，你应该非常小心在卧室里使用科技产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now it turns out that it's yes that that these are attentiongrabbing devices that will mute your sleepiness, but you have to be of a certain personality type. He found not all of us are vulnerable to this sleep disruption of devices. You have to be someone who is perhaps neurotic, someone who has high impulsivity or someone who is perhaps high anxious. If you are of any of those kinds, you should be really careful about your use of technology in the bedroom.</p>
</details>

第二点是规律性。当我们谈到什么才是真正的好睡眠时，我们会回到规律性。如果你只能做一件事，不是三件，而是一件，那就是：在同一时间上床睡觉和起床。无论工作日还是周末，规律性是王道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The the second is regularity. And we'll come on to regularity when we speak about you know what really makes for good sleep. If you were to only do one thing, not three things, but just one thing. Go to bed and wake up at the same time. No matter whether it's the weekday or the weekend, regularity is king.</p>
</details>

最后一点是光线。在这个现代世界，我们是一个缺乏黑暗的社会。我们在夜晚接触到我称之为“垃圾光”的东西。我们不需要所有这些光线，它会欺骗我们的大脑，让它以为外面还是白天。所以，作为一个社会，我们在夜间睡眠方面遇到一些困难也就不足为奇了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the final thing is light. In this modern world, we are a dark deprived society. We get what I call junk light at night. So you've heard of junk DNA. Well, we get junk light at night. We don't need all of this light and it fools our brain into thinking it's still daytime outside. So no wonder as a society we have some struggles with sleep at night.</p>
</details>

在接下来的7天里，就做这个实验。如果可以的话，在你通常睡觉时间前一小时设置一个闹钟。当闹钟响起时，关掉家里几乎所有的灯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So for the next 7 days, just do me this experiment. If you can set an alarm 1 hour before your normal bedtime. When that alarm goes off, turn off, and I I do this myself, turn off almost all of the lights in your house.</p>
</details>

### 睡眠的四大宏观指标：QQRT框架
我查看了科学文献，为自己创建了一个良好睡眠的“四大宏观指标”框架。你听说过食物的三大宏观营养素：脂肪、蛋白质、碳水化合物。对我来说，良好睡眠有四大宏观指标，即QQRT。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when I looked at the science, for me, I created this framework of the four macros of good sleep. You've heard of the three macros of food, macronutrients, fat, protein, carbohydrate. To me, there are four macros of good sleep. And it's QQQRT. QQRT and it stands for quantity, quality, regularity, and timing.</p>
</details>

它代表数量（Quantity）、质量（Quality）、规律性（Regularity）和时机（Timing）。与其把它们想象成支柱，不如想象成一把椅子的四条腿。如果其中任何一条变得不稳定，椅子就会翻倒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and it stands for quantity, quality, regularity, and timing. And think of it less like pillars, but the four legs of a chair. And if any one of these becomes unstable, the chair will topple over.</p>
</details>

我可能先从人们听我反复强调的一点开始，那就是数量。7到9小时。关于8小时的迷思是无稽之谈，它是一个很好的范围：7到9小时。我们知道，以7到9小时为最佳范围，当你睡眠少于这个时间，你的睡眠越短，你的寿命就越短。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I'll probably start with the one that people have heard me bang on about, which is quantity. 7 to 9 hours. This myth of 8 hours is nonsense. It's a wonderful range. 7 to 9 hours. And what we know is that using that sweet spot of 7 to 9 hours, when you get less than that, the shorter your sleep, the shorter your life.</p>
</details>

短睡眠预示着全因死亡率。我们说，最低睡眠时间是7小时。有些人可能会正确地争辩说，如果你看这些死亡率曲线，睡6小时和你说最低要睡7小时之间，百分比差异并不大。所以6小时也挺好。我认为他们混淆了概念。因为7小时是你生存所需的最低睡眠量。我们量化“最低”的方式是基于你是否会过早死亡。生存所需的睡眠量与茁壮成长所需的睡眠量是不同的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Short sleep predicts all cause mortality. Now, we say that there's the minimum of 7 hours of sleep. And some people have argued perhaps correctly that look, if you look at these mortality curves, there's not much of a percentage difference between sleeping six hours versus the seven that you're telling me is minimum. So 6 hours is just fine. I think they've made a conflation because 7 hours is the minimum amount of sleep that you need to survive. Because the way that we quantify what minimum is is based on whether you die or you don't prematurely, the amount of sleep that you need to survive is different than the amount of sleep that you need to thrive.</p>
</details>

我们知道，能够靠6小时或更少睡眠生存，且大脑或身体没有任何损伤的人数，四舍五入到整数并以人口百分比表示，是零。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Certainly what we know is that the number of individuals who can survive on 6 hours of sleep or less and show no impairment in either their brain or their body rounded to a whole number and expressed as a percent of the population is zero.</p>
</details>

所以数量很重要，但事实证明，我们以为这是唯一重要的事情，那就错了，因为接着是质量。在睡眠科学中，质量由两件事定义。第一是你的睡眠追踪器会测量的东西，即你睡眠的连续性。也就是说，你整晚的睡眠是集中在一两个不错的长时段里吗？那是高质量的睡眠。与之相对的是，你的睡眠被各种觉醒打断，非常碎片化，那是质量很差的睡眠。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So quantity matters but it turns out that we got it wrong in thinking that was the only thing because then came quality. So QQRT quality is defined in sleep science as two things. The first is something that your sleep tracker will measure which is the continuity of your sleep. Meaning do you sleep in one or two nice long bouts throughout the night? That's good quality of sleep, nice continuous bouts versus your sort of sleep is very fragmented by all of these awakenings. That's very poor quality of sleep.</p>
</details>

接下来是我们之前提到的，在我说的三件事中。第一是数字排毒，第二件事我说的是规律性。这也是我改变看法的地方。我更加坚信规律性的重要性。有一项研究也来自我描述的那个数据集，叫做英国生物样本库数据。这次他们研究的不是9万人，而是6万人。他们决定将这些人分成四分位数，从最规律的到第二规律的，再到第三规律的，最后是那些最不规律的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The next is where we came to in our sort of three things that I was saying. The first is digital detox. Then next thing I said is regularity. This is somewhere where I've also changed my mind on. I've doubled down on regularity. There was a study that also came out of that same data set that I described. It's called the UK Bioank data. And now they didn't look at 90,000 individuals, but they looked at 60,000 individuals. And they decided that they were going to compare and split them into quartiles. So the most regular to the second most regular to then sort of the third most regular and then the final quartile was those who were the least regular.</p>
</details>

高度规律的个体，其上床睡觉和起床的时间波动在正负15分钟以内，也就是说，总的浮动范围是30分钟。而那些最不规律的人，他们的作息时间相差90到120分钟。他们可能一晚11点睡，第二天凌晨1点，再下一晚10点半，然后又是12点半。他们的作息完全没有规律。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good question. highly regular individuals plus or minus 15 minutes in terms of going to bed and waking up at the same time. In other words, a total wiggle room of 30 minutes. Whereas the those people who were least regular, they were 90 to 120 minutes desperate. They were going to bed, let's say, at 11 one night, then 1 a.m. the next night, then they were going to bed at 10:30 p.m. and then they were going to bed at 12:30. They were all over the map.</p>
</details>

他们发现，与最不规律的人相比，那些最规律的人的全因死亡率相对降低了49%。也就是说，他们过早死亡的可能性比那些最不规律的人低49%。他们的癌症死亡风险降低了39%，这很棒。他们的心血管代谢疾病风险降低了57%。这太惊人了。规律性在预测不同形式的死亡率方面，是一个极其强大的信号。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what they found was that those people who were most regular versus least regular, so they compared the extremes of these two, those people who were most regular had a 49% relative decrease in all cause mortality. So they were 49% less likely to prematurely die than those people who were least likely to die. They had a 39% cancer mortality risk reduction. Great. they had a 57% cardioabolic disease risk reduction. So that was stunning. That regularity was incredibly powerful as a predictive signal of your different forms of mortality.</p>
</details>

但这还不是这篇论文最精彩的部分。他们还测量了这些个体的睡眠数量和规律性。然后他们决定说，好吧，我把数量和规律性的测量结果放在同一个统计模型里，做一个“可口可乐对百事可乐”的挑战，看看哪个在预测全因死亡率方面胜出。我们睡眠领域的专家，至少我是这样，都赌数量会赢。我错了。在预测全因死亡率方面，规律性击败了数量，而且优势相当大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That wasn't the best part of the paper though. They had also measured quantity as well as regularity in these same individuals. So then they decided to say, well, I'm going to take our measure of quantity and regularity and we're going to put them both in the same statistical bucket and do a Coke Pepsi challenge to see which one wins out in terms of predicting all cause mortality. We all bet in the sleep field, at least I did, it was going to be quantity. I was wrong. Regularity beat out quantity in predicting all cause mortality and by quite some margin.</p>
</details>

### 揭秘大脑节律：规律性为何至关重要
人们不会响应规则，他们响应的是规则背后的原因。所以让我试着解释一下这个规则背后的原因。说到规律性，我们体内有一种叫做昼夜节律的东西。在大脑深处，有一个时钟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a bloody great question. People don't respond to rules. They respond to reasons not rules. So let me try and explain the reason behind the sort of the rule. When it comes to regularity, we have something called a circadian rhythm that we've spoken about. And there's a clock that sits inside of your brain deep in the middle of the brain.</p>
</details>

在大脑的正中央，有一个叫做下丘脑的区域。在这个结构中，有一个核团，这组细胞有一个花哨的名字，叫做**视交叉上核**（Suprachiasmatic Nucleus: 位于下丘脑的一个微小区域，是哺乳动物昼夜节律的“主时钟”）。但视交叉上核就是你的主24小时生物钟。你身体里的每个细胞都有一个生物钟，但这是主时钟。就像《指环王》里，有一枚戒指统治所有戒指。同样，有一个时钟统治所有时钟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it turns out that right in the middle of the brain, right here, there's an area called the hypothalamus. Now here, this structure here, this is the phalamus. This is the sensory gate of your brain. And that group of cells the nucleus has a fancy term and it's called the supraismatic nucleus. But the superismatic nucleus is your master 24-hour clock. Every cell in your body has a clock inside of it. But this is the master clock. It's like Lord of the Rings. There's one ring to rule them all. Well, there's one clock to rule them all.</p>
</details>

你的大脑是如何保持如石英钟般精准的24小时节律的呢？它通过利用来自你眼睛的光和暗等信号来实现。所以当光线通过视网膜时，它告诉下丘脑现在是白天，因此你应该保持清醒。它的节律开始上升。温度和进食也能起到同样的作用，还有各种不同的因素。但总的来说，光线是主要的调节器，它就像光子手指，弹出腕表表盘并精确地重置它。所以，每天都是24小时。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How does your brain keep quartzlike precision 24-hour clock time? How does it do that? The way it does that is that it uses signals such as light and dark from your eyes from your eye. And so when light comes through the retina, it tells the hypothalamus it's daytime and therefore you should be awake. And its rhythm starts its awesome sort of upswing. And temperature can do this and feeding can do this all sorts of different things. But for the most part, light is the principal governor that essentially acts like electrical, I should say, photon fingers that pops the wristwatch dial out and resets it precisely. So, 24 hours every single day.</p>
</details>

利用光线是帮助维持规律性的最佳方式，因为夜晚的人造光会欺骗你的大脑，让它以为外面还是白天。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Using light as the best way to help with that regularity because light if it's artificial at night fools your brain into thinking that it's daytime still outside.</p>
</details>

事实证明，你的行为是另一件会告诉大脑的事情。也就是说，当你在同一时间上床睡觉和起床时，这就像一个锚，锚定了你的昼夜节律。它告诉你，就像电影中的一个场景，这个场景现在结束了，一个新的场景开始了。所以，每当你在同一时间睡觉和起床，你都在向你大脑中的主24小时时钟——视交叉上核——输送规律性的信号。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It turns out that your behavior is another thing that will tell your brain. So, meaning when you go to bed and wake up at the same time, it acts like an anchor. It anchors your circadian rhythm and it tells you almost like a scene in a aovie. This scene is now complete. A new scene starts. This scene is complete. A new scene starts. So every time that you're going to bed at the same time and waking up at the same time, you are feeding the super chaismatic nucleus, the master 24-hour clock in your brain, you're feeding it signals of regularity.</p>
</details>

当它接收到规律性的信号时，它会改善你睡眠的数量和质量。你的昼夜节律喜欢一致性，喜欢规律的信号。当你给它光线、活动、起床、睡觉的信号时，你就改善了睡眠的数量和质量。这就是这个规则背后的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when it feeds on signals of regularity, it improves the quantity and the quality of your sleep. Your circadian rhythm likes consistency. It likes regular signals. When you feed it signals of light, of activity, of waking up, going to bed, you improve the quantity and the quality of your sleep. That's the reason behind the underlying rule.</p>
</details>

### REM睡眠的魔力：情绪疗愈与创造力之源
我们入睡后，首先进入浅度非快速眼动睡眠，即第一阶段。在这个阶段，如果我把你叫醒，你会说：“我没睡着。”这只是你正处于清醒和真正睡眠之间的过渡阶段。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when we first fall asleep, we go into light non rapid eye movement sleep. Stage one. This is the stage of sleep that if I wake you up out of it, you say, "I wasn't sleeping." Now you it's just that you're just in that transitional phase, this beautiful liinal state between the windows of wakefulness and true sleep.</p>
</details>

然后，你进入睡眠的主力阶段，即第二阶段非快速眼动睡眠。你夜晚50%的时间都花在这个阶段。我不喜欢“浅度非快速眼动睡眠”这个词，虽然我经常用，但它并不准确。我们在第二阶段非快速眼动睡眠中进行大量的认知处理，这是很有益的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then you get into the workhorse of sleep. This is stage two nonREM sleep. 50% of your night is spent in stage two nonREM sleep. I don't like the word light nonREM sleep. I've often used it, but it's not really it's we do a lot of cognitive processing in stage two nonREM sleep. It's good stuff.</p>
</details>

然后，如果在夜晚的头几个小时，我们会进入最深的深度非快速眼动睡眠阶段。这时，脑电波模式变慢，但波幅变得非常大、有力。在这个阶段，你的许多主要生理系统会得到大量的恢复和修复。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then if it's in the first couple of hours of the night, we go down into the very deepest stages of deep non-REM sleep. This is where the brain wave patterns slow down. But the brain waves become incredibly big, huge, big, powerful, slow brain waves. This is where you get an enormous amount of restoration, recovery of many of your major physiological systems.</p>
</details>

我们从浅度非快速眼动睡眠，然后进入深度非快速眼动睡眠。我们会在那里待大约15到20分钟。然后我们会开始再次上升，回到第二阶段非快速眼动睡眠。我们在那里停留，大约70到80分钟后，你会突然进入一个短暂的**REM睡眠**（Rapid Eye Movement Sleep: 快速眼动睡眠，是睡眠的一个阶段，此时眼球会快速移动，并常常伴有生动的梦境）期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we've gone from light non-REM, then we go down into deep nonrem. We'll stay there for about 15 or 20 minutes. Then we'll start to rise back up again. We'll go back into stage two nonREM sleep. We're going to stay there and after about 70 80 minutes, you're going to pop up and you'll have a short REM sleep period.</p>
</details>

然而，有趣的是，非快速眼动睡眠与快速眼动睡眠的比例会发生变化。在夜晚的前半段，大部分90分钟的周期由大量的深度非快速眼动睡眠和很少的快速眼动睡眠组成。但当你进入夜晚的后半段，这个跷跷板的平衡就会发生变化，你在快速眼动睡眠中花费的时间会多得多，尤其是在夜晚的最后两个小时。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What changes however is the ratio of non-REM to REM within those 90inut cycles as you move across the night such that in the first half of the night the majority of those 90-minute cycles are comprised of lots of deep non-REM sleep and very little REM sleep. But as you push through to the second half of the night, now that seesaw balance shifts over and you spend much more of your time in REM sleep in the second half of the night and particularly just as you said in the last 2 hours of the night.</p>
</details>

这为什么重要呢？就像你刚才说的，假设我为了方便计算，通常在午夜睡觉，早上8点起床。但明天我得赶飞机回家，所以我要提前两小时起床，也就是6点而不是8点。我损失了两个小时的睡眠。那么我总共损失了多少睡眠呢？我损失了8小时睡眠中的2小时，也就是总睡眠的25%。但实际上，我可能损失了所有REM睡眠的50%、60%甚至70%。为什么？因为REM睡眠主要发生在后半夜，特别是最后几个小时。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why is this consequential? Well, just as you said and you spoke about for your girlfriend, let's say that you know I normally go to bed for argument sake and I'm not saying this is the ideal time, but I go to bed at midnight to make the math easy and I wake up at 8:00. But tomorrow I've got to catch my flight back home. So, I'm going to wake up two hours early. So, I'm going to wake up at 6 rather than 8. I've lost two hours of sleep. So, how much total sleep have I lost? Well, I've lost 25% of my total sleep. 2 hours of my 8 hours. 25%. Well, yes and no. I've lost 25% of my total sleep, but I may have lost 50 60 70% of all of my REM sleep. Why? Because REM sleep comes in the second half of them, particularly those last couple of hours of sleep.</p>
</details>

我们做梦至少有两个原因。第一个原因是情绪急救。我将REM睡眠定义为“隔夜疗法”。正是在梦境睡眠中，你的大脑会处理那些困难、痛苦的情感体验，它就像一种夜间的舒缓膏，磨平那些痛苦经历的锋利棱角，让你第二天醒来时，虽然还记得那个情绪事件，但它不再那么情绪化了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why do we dream? We dream for at least two different reasons. The first reason is emotional first aid. REM sleep is what I've defined as overnight therapy and it's during dream sleep where your brain takes difficult painful emotional experiences and it acts like a nocturnal soothing balm and it just takes the sharp edges off those difficult painful experiences so that you come back the next day and you have a memory of an emotional event but it's no longer emotional.</p>
</details>

为什么REM睡眠能够进行这种隔夜疗法，这种情绪削弱作用呢？原因如下：梦境睡眠，即REM睡眠，是24小时周期中，大脑唯一关闭一种与压力相关的神经化学物质——去甲肾上腺素的时间。

<p class="english-text">Why is REM sleep able to do this overnight therapy, this deepotentiation? The reason is the following. Dream sleep, REM sleep is the only time during the 24-hour period where the brain shuts off a stress related neurochemical called noradrenaline.</p>

我们提出了一个理论，认为**创伤后应激障碍**（PTSD - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: 一种由经历或目睹创伤性事件而引发的心理健康状况）就是这种机制失灵的典型例子。因为当你和这些患者交谈时，我们不仅看到他们的REM睡眠受到干扰，他们还会说：“我就是无法‘释怀’那件事。”他们的意思是，大脑没有将情绪从记忆中剥离。所以每当他们重温那段记忆，就会重新体验到同样的情绪反应。

<p class="english-text">And we put forward a theory that perhaps the quintessential disorder where this fails is PTSD. Because when you speak to those patients, not only do we see that their REM sleep is disrupted, when you speak to those patients, they will say, "Look, I just can't quote unquote get over the event." What they mean by that is the brain has not stripped the emotion from the memory. So every time they relive the memory, they regurgitate that same emotional reaction.</p>

但做梦还有第二个完全独立的益处。做梦是一种信息炼金术。做梦就是创造力。我告诉过你，在深度非快速眼动睡眠期间，我们把新学的记忆固定下来。这保存了新知识的单个片段。然后是REM睡眠，它发生在深度睡眠之后，记忆处理的第二阶段开始。这时，REM睡眠开始将你最近学到的所有东西与整个旧知识库融合在一起。所以你醒来时，会有一个全新的、遍布大脑的联想网络，能够为以前无法解决的问题提供解决方案。

<p class="english-text">But there's a second completely independent benefit of dreaming. Dreaming is a form offormational alchemy. Dreaming is creativity. Now I told you that during deep non-REM sleep, we take new memories that we've learned and we fixate them like Amber sort of setting a fossil in and we do that during deep sleep. That saves the individual pieces of the new stuff. Then comes along REM sleep which happens after deep sleep. And the second phase of memory processing happens. That's where REM sleep starts to fuse all of the things that you've recently been learning with this entire back catalog of information. And so you wake up with a revised mindwide web of associations that is capable of diving solutions to previously impenetrable problems.</p>

### 睡眠的未来：基因编辑与新型助眠药物
自我们上次交谈以来，可能发生的最惊人的发现，是发现了我们称之为“天生短睡眠者”的人。这些人由于基因突变，仅需6.25小时，也就是6小时15分钟的睡眠就能生存，并且他们的大脑或身体没有任何损伤，他们靠6小时睡眠就能过得很好。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Probably the most spectacular discovery that has happened since you and I last spoke is the discovery of what we call the genetic short sleepers. These are individuals who by way of a genetic mutation can survive on as little as 6.25 hours of sleep. In other words, 6 hours and 15 minutes of sleep. and they show zero impairment in their brain or their body, they can do just fine on six hours of sleep.</p>

我们已经确定了四个相关基因。这些基因让这些人能够以一种通常会导致疾病的睡眠量安然无恙。此时，可能有些听众会想：“我觉得我就是这种人。”需要说明的是，你一生中被闪电击中的概率是0.00000064，极不可能。而你拥有ADRB1基因（短睡眠基因之一）的概率是0.004。换句话说，你在统计上被闪电击中的可能性比拥有那个短睡眠基因的可能性还要大。

<p class="english-text">And we have four genes that we've identified now. The first two genes. These genes allow these individuals to get away with an amount of sleep that normally would cause predictive disease and sickness just as we've spoken about. So, at this point, probably some people listening are thinking, I think I'm one of those people. Just to put it in context, your the probability that you will be struck by lightning in your lifetime is 0.00. 00064 highly unlikely the chances of you having the ADRB1 gene is 0.004 and the DBR1 gene is the short sleeper gene is one of the short sleeping genes. So in other words you are statistically more likely to be struck by lightning in your lifetime than you are to have that short sleeping gene.</p>

这告诉我们一些超越生物学奇观的东西。它揭示了进化中的一个深刻论断：大自然已经通过基因找到了压缩睡眠的方法。你可以把八小时压缩到六小时。

反乌托邦在哪里？我们都听说过**CRISPR**（Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats: 一种强大的基因编辑技术），这是加州大学伯克利分校我隔壁实验室的詹妮弗·杜德纳发现的基因编辑工具，她因此获得了诺贝尔奖。未来会不会出现这样的情况——我希望不会——我们开始通过基因工程将人们的睡眠需求从7到9小时减少到6小时？

<p class="english-text">Where's the dystopia? Well, we've all heard of crisper, which is this genetic editing manipulation tool that a lab next door to mine at UC Berkeley discovered, Jennifer Downer. She won a Nobel Prize for it. Is there some future, and I hope not. Is there some future where we start to genetically engineer people from a need of 7 to n hours down to a need of six?</p>
</details>

我之所以害怕，是因为我确信，一旦六小时成为新的八小时，所有人都会开始只睡四小时。然后我就又回到了同样的战斗中。因为六小时是你需要的最低限度，而他们会说：“好吧，如果那是最低限度，那我就睡四小时。”

<p class="english-text">Why do I fear it? I know for a fact that as soon as six becomes the new eight, everyone starts sleeping four. And now I'm just back into the same battle again because six is the minimum that you need. And they say, "Well, if that's the minimum, then I'll sleep four."</p>

### 新型助眠药物的兴起
关于食欲素（orexin）的故事，催生了第一类我个人比较推崇的新型安眠药的发明，而大多数人对此并不了解。我们基本上进入了安眠药的Web 3.0时代。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">this story of ereexin has led to the invention of the first new class of sleeping medication that I actually favor and most people are not aware of it. It's a new class of we're on to essentially web 3.0 of sleep medication.</p>
</details>

Web 1.0是苯二氮䓬类药物，如Xanax和Valium，对睡眠效果不佳。第二波，即Web 2.0，是像Ambien、Lunesta、Sonata这类药物。这两类药物的作用方式非常相似，它们进入你的大脑皮层，刺激一个叫做GABA的受体，这是大脑主要的神经抑制性递质。所以当这些药物充斥你的大脑时，它们只是按下了红灯，停止了皮层的神经放电。本质上，它们是镇静你。而镇静不是睡眠。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Web 1.0 were the benzoazipines things like Xanax and Valium not great for sleep. The second wave the web 2.0 those were things like ambient lanesta sonata. Both of those drugs worked in a very similar way where they go up to your cortex and they tickle a receptor called the GABA receptor, GABA, GABA. And it's the major neuroinhibitory transmitter of the brain. So when these drugs flood your brain, they just hit the red light and they stop neural firing of the cortex. Essentially, they sedate you. And sedation is not sleep.</p>
</details>

但我们通过对发作性睡病的研究意识到，如果食欲素这个大脑中的“清醒音量按钮”是失眠患者的问题所在，我们是否可以开发一种药物，它不是像Ambien那样镇静大脑皮层，而是进入脑干中食欲素的中心？这些新药被称为**多拉类药物**（DORAs - Dual Orexin Receptor Antagonists: 一类通过阻断食欲素受体来促进睡眠的新型药物），它们就像一组聪明的化学手指，进入脑干中释放食欲素的地方，只是调低了清醒的音量，然后退后一步，让清醒的对立面——也就是所谓的自然睡眠——取而代之。

<p class="english-text">But after we realized by way of the story of narcolepsy that if this chemical ereexin, this wakefulness volume button in the brain is a problem in insomnia patients. What if we were to just develop a drug that doesn't sedate the cortex like ambient? Instead, it goes down into the brain stem where the center for erection is. And these new drugs and they're called the Doras drugs, D A small s. And it's a class of drugs. They act like a clever set of chemical fingers. They go down into the brain stem where this sort of erection is being released and they just dial down the volume on wakefulness and then they take a step back and they allow the antithesis of wakefulness to come in its place which is this thing called naturalistic sleep.</p>

### 结语：成功、幸福与人际关系的沉思
成功带给我两样东西，一个有益，一个不那么有益。有益的是，我现在有机会，也被赋予了机会，飞往世界各地，努力传播关于睡眠的知识，因为它的生理学是如此的默默无闻。

<p class="english-text">It brought me two things. one beneficial one less. So beneficial is that I have now the chance and have gifted the chance to fly around the world and tried to speak the word of sleep because the physiology of it is so silent.</p>

不过，我得说，当你把头探出公众的栏杆时，别惊讶会有人向你开火。如果你是一个哪怕只有一丝不安全感的人，评论会给你带来不小的伤害。所以，我认为，成为公众人物会让你产生一定程度的脆弱和不安全感。如果我没有成为公众人物，我可能不会那么在意自己的智力、声音或者那灾难性的男孩乐队发型。

<p class="english-text">I would say though that there is also, and I suspect you may experience some of this too, when you raise your head above the public parapit, don't be surprised if shots are fired. And if you're someone who has even the vaguest hint of insecurity, comments will do you a lovely disservice. And so I think there's a degree of kind of vulnerability and insecurity that you can develop by way of becoming um someone who is in the eye of the public that had I not been in the eye of the public I probably wouldn't have been you know as self-conscious about whether it's you know your intellect or your voice or your you know disastrous you know boyband haircut whatever it is.</p>

我找到了我的那个人。她就像晴空中的一道闪电，毫无预兆地出现了。有趣的是，我从未能比和她在一起时更真实地做自己，即使是独自一人时也做不到。她每天都让我想成为一个更好的人。我找到了前所未有的平静。

有一个名叫克莱夫·韦林的绅士，他的故事令人难以置信地悲伤。克莱夫是神经科学界的一个著名人物，电影《记忆碎片》就是根据他的故事改编的。他感染了一种病毒，摧毁了他的记忆中枢。从那一刻起，他再也无法形成任何新的记忆。他生活在仅仅两三秒的时间里。他唯一记得并能认出的人是他的妻子。

<details>

<p class="english-text">There's a an incredibly sad story of a gentleman called Clive Wearing. And Clive is a famous individual in the neuroscience world. And Clive was the man who the movie Momento was based on, which is a movie where a man has brain damage and he has profound amnesia. And from that moment forward, he can never make any new memories whatsoever. He's densely amnesic. And he was a real life individual. He contracted a virus that destroyed his memory centers. And from that point forward, he could no longer make any new memories. And he lived in just 2 or 3 seconds of time. The only person that he remembered and he would recognize is his wife.</p>
</details>

问题是，他从不记得距离上次见到妻子有多久了。所以，每当她离开房间5分钟后再走进来时，他都会从椅子上跳起来，带着难以置信的喜悦，跑过去拥抱她、亲吻她。我想，我们有时会把伴侣视为理所当然，只有当他们离开时，我们才意识到他们有多么珍贵。我常常思考，自满可能是亲密关系中最大的负面力量之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the problem was he never remembered how long it's been since he last saw his wife. And so every time that she would walk into the room after being out of it for 5 minutes, he would jump out of his chair and he had this incredible elation and he would run and he would hug her and kiss her. And I think sometimes we take our partners for granted and the only time we realize how precious they are is when they're gone. And I often think about that that complacency can be one of the greatest negative forces in a relationship.</p>
</details>

我常常想起克莱夫·韦林，即使在我心情不好、情绪低落、不想与人交往的日子里。我总是努力回想他的反应。当我的妻子下班回家，或者我第一眼看到她时，我努力回想他的反应，以及尽管被负面压力的阴霾笼罩，我内心真实的感受。

And when my wife walks back in from work or I see her, you know, first thing, I try to remember how his reaction was and how I truly feel at the time despite the blanket of negative stress trying to drown that feeling out.</p>
