### F-35采购决策延迟

**Ann Fitz-Gerald**: Ann Fitz-Gerald 是 **Balsillie School of International Affairs** 的主任，也是 **Wilfrid Laurier University** 的政治学教授；Philippe Lagasse 是 **Carleton University** **Norman Paterson School of International Affairs** 的副教授兼 Barton 主席。我想先请教您。去年三月，**总理马克·卡尼**下令审查加拿大从**美国**购买**F-35**战机的交易。目前，我们暂时只购买 16 架。请帮助我们理解，这个审查即将满一年了。为什么这个决定会耗费如此之长的时间？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Fitz-Gerald**: Ann Fitz-Gerald is the director of the Balsillie School of International Affairs and professor of political science at Wilfrid Laurier University, and Philippe Lagasse is associate professor and Barton Chair at Carleton University's Norman Paterson School of International Affairs. And I want to start with you. Last March, Prime Minister Mark Carney ordered a review of Canada's purchase of some F-35 aircrafts from the US. At the moment, we are buying just 16 for now. Help us understand we are about to near the one year mark of this. What is the why is the decision taking so long?

</details>

**Philippe Lagasse**: 嗯，我认为很多因素都在影响这个决定。这是一个重要的决定，一个将在未来几十年都产生影响的决定。它关乎重要的能力，不仅对**加拿大武装部队**，也关乎我们的**关键基础设施需求**。更广泛地说，这个问题涉及到一些战略考量，包括扩大我们未来的选择和采购选项，不再过度依赖某些国家供应商。这个问题关系到与其他盟友的**互操作性**，我们的**北约**盟友，我们在**美国**的盟友，当然还有成本、平台复杂性以及我们现有的需求，这些需求需要与加拿大的其他国防和安全投资相辅相成。什么能最好地满足这些需求，并以一种有利于更广泛国防任务的方式来补充这些需求？随着**国防工业战略**的发布，我们将听到更多细节。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Well, I think many things are affecting the decision. It's an important decision. It's a decision that's going to last for for decades into the future. It's important capability, not just for the Canadian Armed Forces, but for our critical infrastructure needs. More broadly, the issue speaks to a number of strategic concerns, expanding our the choices and our procurement options moving forward and not being so reliant on certain national suppliers. The issue concerns interoperability with other allies, our NATO allies, our allies in the US and of course, cost and platform sophistication and the needs that we have that complement other defence and security investments here in Canada. What will best help those needs, complement those needs in a way that works for the broader defence mission, more details of which we are going to hear more of as the Defence Industrial Strategy becomes released.

</details>

**Ann Fitz-Gerald**: Philippe，我也想听听您的看法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Philippe, I'll get your take on that as well.

</details>

**Philippe Lagasse**: 有许多不同的因素，其中最重要的一点是，目前对于**加拿大空军**来说，同时操作**F-35**和其他战斗机组成的混合机队将非常困难。我们已经在飞行员和技术人员方面面临挑战，并且建立**F-35**的**基础设施成本**也很高，如果再增加一个机队，成本将相当可观。与**NORAD**的互操作性不仅仅是与**美国**并肩作战，**NORAD**是负责北美防务的双国家指挥部，这不仅仅是合作的问题。当人们听到互操作性时，他们就想当然地认为，这只是，你知道的，就像通过无线电通信一样。它要全面得多。在当代战争中，**F-35**会集成到一个更广泛的“系统之系统”中。而**美国大使**曾明确告诉我们，如果我们购买欧洲战斗机，那么一些集成可能会受到质疑。但坦白说，我认为我们在这里处理的是两件事：要么政府希望向**Lockheed Martin**施压以获得更多经济利益，并可能向**白宫**施压，以配合加拿大重新谈判自由贸易；要么政府正在认真考虑通过在加拿大建造战斗机来获取经济利益并建立**加拿大国防工业基地**。但之所以耗时如此之长，是因为这样做成本极其高昂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> There's a number of different factors, not the least of which is operating a mixed fleet of F-35s and other fighter would be very difficult for the Canadian Air Force at this moment. Already we're struggling with pilots and technicians and the infrastructure costs of setting up the F-35, where you'd add another fleet that would be quite significant as well. Interoperability with NORAD isn't simply alongside the United States, which is a bi national command for the defence of North America isn't simply a question of working with. When people hear interoperability, they just assume that it must be, you know, just kind of communicating like over a radio. It's much more comprehensive than that. And contemporary warfare, the F-35 integrates into a wider system of systems. And the American ambassador has told us in no uncertain terms that if we acquire a European fighter, some of that integration may be called into question. But frankly, I think we're dealing with two things here. Either the government is hoping to put pressure on Lockheed Martin for more economic benefits, and potentially on the white House leading up to Canada's renegotiation of free trade. Or the government is seriously contemplating trying to get economic benefits and stand up a Canadian defence industrial base by building a fighter here in Canada. But the reason it's taking so long is the cost is extremely high to do that.

### 加拿大国防战略缺失

**Ann Fitz-Gerald**: 好的。在我们多谈谈钱之前，Philippe，我想继续问您。在一篇论文中，您将加拿大描述为拥有一个“不具战略性的国防政策”。您是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> All right. Before we talk a little bit more about money, Philippe, I want to stick with you in a paper you described Canada as having an unstrategic defence policy. What do you mean by that?

</details>

**Philippe Lagasse**: 我们在加拿大并不真正制定战略，或者说我们很长时间以来都没有这样做。我们是追随者。所以，在国际和平与安全方面，我们的战略在很大程度上是跟随我们最大的盟友的做法。同样，**北约**联盟在基本原则方面为我们提供了一些指导，但我们确实不制定战略。我们只是努力确保我们的旗帜插在正确的地方。当你看看过去 40 年的作战地图时，我敢说，尤其是在军事层面，我们所做的就是试图“即插即用”地融入**美国**武装部队。为什么？因为这样做非常便宜，而不是试图开辟自己的道路。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> We don't really do strategy in Canada, or we haven't done it in a very long time. We are followers. So our strategy when it comes to international peace and security has largely been to follow what our largest ally has, has done. Similarly, the NATO alliance provides us some guidance in terms of fundamentals, but really we don't do strategy. We we we try and make sure that our flag is in the right place. When you look at maps of operations and over the past 40 years, I would argue that certainly on a military level, what are we tried to do? We've tried to plug and play into the American armed forces. And why? Because it's really cheap to do that as opposed to trying to forge your own path.

</details>

**Ann Fitz-Gerald**: 您认为加拿大目前的国防采购系统存在哪些最大的问题？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> And what would you say are some of the biggest problems with Canada's defence procurement system as it stands right now?

</details>

**Ann Fitz-Gerald**: 嗯，我认为 Philippe 提出的问题对我来说是最重要的，那就是我们不制定战略。政策和战略是有区别的。政策是意图的声明。战略则关乎执行的紧迫性、排序、时间表以及逐月、逐年用于执行的资源。而我们在这方面做得并不好。自 2000 年代初以来，我们已经看到了几份政策发布，但没有一份附带公开且明确这些细节的执行战略。因此，这里的一些挑战涉及到政府如何作为一个明智的客户，与加拿大企业和外国企业合作，以启动这项能力。你知道，我们甚至看到我们盟友的外国使馆如今的结构也不同了，使馆内设有能力部门，国内也有能力部门，以加快采购交付速度，引进了解新通用目的基础设施采购能力的人才。这正在影响社会各行各业，即使是最传统的社会部门。比如数据、**AI**、**网络安全**、知识产权，所有这些都指向了对“加拿大公司”的定义也需要更新。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Well, I think Philippe raised the most important one for me, and that is that we don't do strategy. So policy there's a difference between policy and strategy. Policy is a declaration of intent. Strategy speaks to the execution imperatives, the sequencing, the timelines, the resources that would be used on a month to month, year to year basis to execute. And we have not been good at that. We've seen a couple of policies published since the early 2000, and neither of them have come with an execution strategy that has been made public, and that has been clear on these details. So some of the challenges here are concern the government working as a smart customer with Canadian businesses and foreign businesses to get this capability up and running. You know, we're even seeing foreign embassies of our allies being structured differently these days with capability in the embassies and capability at home to speed the delivery of procurement to to bring in capability that is knowledgeable about procurement of the new general purpose infrastructure that we're working with. That's affecting every sector of society at the moment, even the most traditional sectors of society. So data, AI, cybersecurity, intellectual property and this all points to kind of a new definition of what constitutes a Canadian company as well.

</details>

### 国防开支的有效性

**Philippe Lagasse**: Philippe，正如我们所注意到的，我们在这里花费了大量的金钱，我想更好地理解加拿大国防开支中有多少只是“做样子”，无论是对**美国总统**还是对**北约**盟友，而不是看它在国内或国外的实际效力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Philippe, as as we noted, we are spending a lot, a lot of money here, and I want to get a better understanding of how much of Canada's defence spending is just for show, whether it's, you know, to the US president or to its NATO allies, rather than how effective it is here or abroad.

</details>

**Philippe Lagasse**: 坦率地说，当我们审视过去 40 年我们试图达到的雄心水平时，国防开支基本上是“骨架式”的。回到“即插即用”与更大盟军合作的想法，我们试图将**GDP**的约 **1.5%** 用于国防，正如许多评论员指出的那样，这仅仅是足够做出重要贡献的水平，但仅此而已。国内影响主要体现在外国子公司和我们从一些大宗采购中获得的抵消措施上，但我们从未真正大力投资于“加拿大国防工业基地”。而这正是我们现在讨论的。为什么那些被提及的数字看起来如此天文数字，是因为你试图承担如此庞大的一项任务。但我会说，你知道，比如达到**GDP**的 **5%** 的说法，现在我们不知道这是否只是做样子。我们不知道这是否是为了安抚**美国总统**，他确实希望以此向盟友施压。你会注意到，那个 **5%** 的数字是相当遥远的。所以很多事情都可能改变。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Well, largely the defence spending has been skeletal, really, when you look at the level of ambition that we've tried to do over the past 40 years. So going back to to this idea of plugging and playing with larger Allied forces, we've tried to spend about 1.5% of our GDP having just enough, as many commentators note, to be able to make important contributions, but not much more than that. The domestic impacts have largely been on foreign subsidiaries and offsets that we get from some of our big purchases, but we've never really invested heavily in kind of a Canadian defence industrial base. And this is what we're talking about now. And why the the figures that are being floated seem so astronomical, because you're trying to undertake something so much bigger. But I will say, you know, talk of reaching 5% of GDP, for instance, right now, we don't know if that's just for show. We don't know if that was meant to appease the US president, who really wanted to, to show that he was putting pressure on the allies. You will note that that 5% figure is pretty far out. So a lot can change.

</details>

**Ann Fitz-Gerald**: 我想听听您的看法。支出显然可能只是支出，而不是战略，我们需要更多细节。但我想听听您的看法。这是做样子，还是看它在国内或国外的实际效力？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> And I want to get your take. Spending is clearly just perhaps spending is not strategy and we need more details there. But I just want to get your take on that. Is this for show or is this rather than how effective it is here abroad?

</details>

**Ann Fitz-Gerald**: 我认为这是一个中等强国口头承诺履行其国防承诺的例子，尤其是在我们与那位要求**北约**盟友“慷慨解囊”的叙事大师有着漫长边境线的情况下。国家有责任至少达到**北约**规定的最低**GDP**支出百分比，这本应是过去十年就应承诺的。但现在，我们当然看到了 **5%** 的目标。但我的意思是，这里的好消息是，国防可以被视为“低垂的果实”，一个更广泛的任务，有助于实现现代化，并通过抵消措施提振我们的工业战略，帮助投资于所有部门都将依赖的关键通用基础设施。而且，我们有 **1.5%** 的空间可用于国防和安全相关的支出。所以我们确实有机会将其真正变成能够扩大我们经济规模的东西，而这将在未来帮助我们避免动用其他社会保障预算来资助国防，从而在**GDP**资产负债表的收入端“做大蛋糕”，而不是用同一个蛋糕切成不同的块。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Well, I think it was an example of a middle power verbally committing to stumping up and meeting its its defence commitments, especially when we have such a large shared border with the master of that narrative who asked NATO allies to stump up. And it it's incumbent on the country to at least meet the the minimum NATO GDP percentage spend that it should have been committed to over the previous decade. But now we're looking, of course, at a a target of 5%. But I mean, the good news here
is, is that defence can be treated as a low hanging fruit, a broader mission to help modernise, but also help boost our industrial strategy through offsets, to help invest in that critical general purpose
infrastructure that all sectors are going to work off of.
And we've got a little bit of leeway for that with the 1.5% that can be used for defence and security related expenditure.
So we do have the opportunity to really turn this into something that can scale our economy, and that's what's going to save us from tapping into other Social Security budgets in the future
to finance defence, to grow the pie on the revenue side of our GDP balance sheet, instead of
using the same pie and cutting
it up into different pieces.

### 发展国防工业基础

**Ann Fitz-Gerald**: 好的。看起来等待可能结束了。加拿大的国防工业政策预计本周发布。Philippe，在国防开支增加的情况下，您希望在该文件中看到什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> All right. It looks like the the wait might be over. The defence Canada's defence industrial policy is expected to be released this week. Philippe, what do you want to see in that document on defence as defence spending ramps up?

</details>

**Philippe Lagasse**: 从根本上说，你需要一个买家。如果你希望加拿大工业进行投资，就必须有人购买他们将要制造的东西。而这在加拿大一直缺乏，尤其是在加拿大政府与加拿大工业的关系方面。所以，对于所有关于催化或其他方面的谈论，你不能只处理投资方面。必须有人实际购买这些公司将要制造的东西。因此，我们需要来自加拿大政府的明确需求信号，明确承诺他们将从加拿大工业采购。如果没有这一点，我怀疑工业界会犹豫。所以，那个需求信号会是什么样子，将是一个关键。我还要指出，如果你真的想拥有一个充满活力的国防工业基地，你必须准备好大量出口你的设备。如果你看看那些拥有强大国防工业基础的国家，特别是中等强国，它们会在其他地方销售，仅仅因为国内市场不够大。想想瑞典或法国，特别是。那么，出口战略是什么？所以，这两大要素是：一个买家，以及其他地方的买家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Fundamentally you need a buyer. If you want Canadian industry to invest, somebody has to buy what they're going to make. And that's been traditionally lacking in Canada when it comes to the relationship between the Canadian government and Canadian industry. So for all the talk of catalysing or anything else, you can't just deal with the investment side. Somebody actually has to buy what these companies are going to make. So we need a clear demand signals, as they say, from the government of Canada, a clear commitment that they're going to be buying from Canadian industry. In the absence of that, I suspect industry is going to hesitate. So what that demand signal is going to look like is going to be a key one. I would also note that if you really want to have a vibrant defence industrial base, you have to be ready to export a lot of your equipment. If you look at countries that have maintained a very strong defence industrial base, middle powers in particular, they sell elsewhere simply because your domestic market isn't big enough. So think of Sweden or France in particular. So what's the export strategy? So those are the two big things a buyer and buyers elsewhere.

</details>

**Ann Fitz-Gerald**: 我将关注“增值”的概念。除非我们帮助加拿大中小型企业为其国内经济提供增值服务，并生产世界所需的产品，否则我们无法发展它们。那么，这将有哪些激励措施？采购和决策过程将如何简化，使政府成为一个非常敏捷和有效的客户？以及将在哪些战略领域支持增值？因为这就是你如何发展经济，为你的原材料和基础精炼过程增加价值，变得更复杂，提供一个有利于竞争的环境，并制造其他市场会购买的东西。这将触及我们市场的多元化战略。目前，你无法实现市场多元化，除非你实现产品多元化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> And I'm going to look for the concept of value add. We cannot grow our small to medium size enterprises in Canada unless we help them provide value add for our domestic economy, but also in terms of producing the material that the rest of the world needs. So what are going to be the incentives behind that? How is procurement and decision making going to be streamlined to make the government a very agile and effective customer? And what are those strategic domains in which value add is going to be supported? Because that's how you grow an economy to add value to your raw materials and basic refined processes, to become more sophisticated, to offer a pro-competition environment, and to make things that other markets will buy. And this will tap into the diversification strategy of our markets as well. At the moment, you can't diversify markets unless you diversify products.

</details>

### 国防开支的资金来源

**Ann Fitz-Gerald**: 好的。我想展示一张来自**议会预算办公室**近期关于加拿大**5%**国防开支承诺的报告图表。该办公室估计，到 2035-2036 年，对预算赤字的影响将从 2026-2027 年的 30 亿**美元**增加到 630 亿**美元**。Philippe，这是巨额资金。加拿大如何支付数十亿的国防开支？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> All right. I want to pull up a chart from a recent report by the Parliamentary Budget Office about Canada's 5% spending commitment to NATO. The office estimates that the impact on the budgetary deficit will increase to 63,000,000,000 in 2035, 2036 from 3,000,000,000 in 2026 2027. Philippe, this is a lot of money here. How how does Canada pay for billions in defence spending?

</details>

**Philippe Lagasse**: 嗯，你只有三种方式可以做到。你可以像这张图表所示那样，增加赤字。因此，这意味着随着时间的推移，债务和利息都会增加。这是一个复利问题。你可以提高税收，这不会有多少人乐意。但想象一下，例如，政府说，当初削减的**GST**必须取消，必须恢复到 **7%** 才能负担其中一部分；或者你做出最艰难的决定，那就是削减社会开支和其他领域。因此，可能是削减给各省或对其他项目的拨款。**渥太华**的联邦政府已经在裁员，但这远远不够达到 630 亿**美元**。同样，你可以削减外国援助和其他类似的东西，但这项支出如此巨大，我们不应自欺欺人地认为所需的牺牲程度。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Well, you only really have three ways to do it. You can run more deficits as this chart shows. And therefore that means more debt and more interest over time. And a compounding problem. You can raise taxes, which not a lot of people would be keen on. But imagine, for instance, a government saying that that GST cut way back when has to be reversed, has to go back up to 7% in order to afford some of this, or you make the most difficult decision of all, which would be to cut social spending and other areas. So cuts presumably to the provinces or other programs. Already the federal government is slashing jobs here in Ottawa, but that's not going to be anywhere near that $63 billion. Similarly, you can cut foreign aid and other things like that, but that spend is just so massive that we shouldn't fool ourselves about the level of sacrifice required.

</details>

**Ann Fitz-Gerald**: 我想听听您的看法。加拿大将如何支付数十亿的费用？您是否也和 Philippe 一样有同样的担忧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> And I'll get your take on that. How will Canada pay for billions? And do you share that same concern that Philippe shares here?

</details>

**Ann Fitz-Gerald**: 我确实和 Philippe 有同样的担忧。我会回到我之前提到的观点，即让国防成为一项更宏大的国家战略任务的一部分。回到我关于“做大蛋糕”的观点。而不是把同一个蛋糕切成不同的块。我们如何快速做到这一点？嗯，我们努力确保我们与世界各地的其他国家在国防合作方面，专注于提振加拿大工业。但正如我们在讨论从**韩国**伙伴或**德国**购买潜艇时已经看到的，这取决于**CUSMA**协议的稳固以及与我们**美国**邻居的稳定关系，这样这些伙伴才能进入**美国**市场以及加拿大市场。但是，你知道，支持生产其他复杂的制造产品，这些产品以复杂的设计为基础，比如**清洁技术**，目前它似乎不会与我们的南部邻居产生太多竞争，并且真正激励那些拥有**知识产权**、在**加拿大主权云**上运行、拥有全部**技术栈**都是主权的加拿大公司，这在危机时期以及出于国防和国家安全目的方面非常重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> I do share that same concern as Philippe. I would go back to the point that I made about having this defence focus be part of a larger national strategy mission. And back to the point I made about growing the pie. Instead of cutting the same pie up into different pieces. How do we do that quickly? Well, we try to make sure that our defence collaboration with others around the world focuses on boosting Canadian industry. But as we've already seen with the discussions on the purchase of submarines either from South Korea partners or from Germany, it's predicated on a strong CUSMA agreement and stability with our US neighbours so that there is access for these partners into the US market as well as the Canadian market. But, you know, getting behind the production of other sophisticated manufactured products that are underpinned by sophisticated design, like clean tech, which at the moment doesn't seem like it's going to be competing too much with our southern neighbours and really incentivising Canadian companies that own their IP that operate off a Canadian sovereign cloud, that that have their whole tech stack as sovereign, which is important in crises, times and for defence and national security purposes.

</details>

### 北约的凝聚力与未来

**Ann Fitz-Gerald**: 好的。在最后几分钟里，我还有一个问题想问你们两位。Philippe，既然加拿大已承诺投入数十亿**美元**来履行**北约**承诺，那么问题就应该被问：**北约**目前有多团结？它的未来是什么？您怎么看？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> All right. In the last few minutes, I have one more question for both of you, Philippe. Since Canada has pledged to spend billions of dollars to meet NATO commitments, you know, the question should be asked how unified is NATO currently and what is its future? What do you see?

</details>

**Philippe Lagasse**: 嗯，**北约**联盟目前既有凝聚力，也有一定程度的破裂。在欧洲内部，它比一段时间以来都要强大，因为人们对**俄罗斯**构成的威胁有着清醒的认识，以及在持续冲突中保障并鼓励**乌克兰**胜利的必要性。因此，**北约欧洲**存在着一种我们很久未见的、可能是自冷战以来才有的目标统一和头脑清醒。并非所有国家都如此，显然，**西班牙**有点特立独行，但**芬兰**和**瑞典**的加入本身就足以说明问题。正如您的听众可能知道的那样，事情变得棘手的是北大西洋的跨大西洋部分。**美国**一直严厉批评**北约**盟友，并对**丹麦**施加了相当大的压力，尤其是在**格陵兰**问题上，几乎威胁要入侵。这导致许多人说这个联盟真的“风烛残年”了。我不会走那么远。我认为它会以某种形式存在，但更多的问题是**美国**对**北约**和未来欧洲安全的承诺程度。而这让**美国**和**加拿大**陷入困境，因为我们不在欧洲。我们紧邻**美国**。我们的根本关切必须是北美关系，而不是欧洲关系。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Well, the NATO alliance is both cohesive and somewhat fractured at the moment. Within Europe itself, it's stronger than it's been in some time simply because there's an awareness, acute awareness of the threat posed by Russia and the need to safeguard and encourage a Ukrainian victory in that ongoing conflict. So there is a unity of purpose and a clear mindedness in NATO Europe that we haven't seen in a long time, probably since the Cold War. Not all countries, obviously, Spain is a bit of an outlier, but just the fact that Finland and Sweden joined is is pretty good indication where it gets Dicier, as your listeners probably know, is the transatlantic part of of that North Atlantic. The United States has been highly critical of NATO allies, has put quite a bit of pressure on Denmark when it came to Greenland, almost threatening invasion. And that has led a number of people to say that this alliance is is really on its last legs. I wouldn't go that far. I think it's going to survive in some way, shape or form, but it's more a question of how committed the US is to NATO and European security going forward. And that leaves US Canada in a tough spot because we're not in Europe. We're next to the United States. And our fundamental concern has to be that North American relationship rather than that European one.

</details>

**Philippe Lagasse**: 是的，我认为**北约**的实力在于其威慑我们共同面临的威胁的能力，其中一些威胁**北美**比我们的欧洲伙伴更容易暴露。当联盟关系出现不稳定或某些领域出现信任赤字时，各国就会开始采取对冲策略，联盟的这种可预测信任和团结的力量会在某些地方受到一定程度的损害。所以，你知道，我们真的需要利用**欧洲**目前为联盟带来的力量，共同重新武装，共同威慑**俄罗斯**的侵略。围绕**格陵兰**主权团结的力量，我们保持这种势头，并且对话支撑着联盟所做的一切，因为这种力量在**北极地区**已成为重要的地缘战略通道时至关重要，该地区的极地冰融化使得那些大片领土更容易进入、更宜居、更易于航行。所以，是的，我认为我们不会看到**北约**崩溃。它正经历一个有点尴尬的时刻，面临一些在其历史上从未遇到过的困难挑战，但我们看到围绕**格陵兰**问题、围绕不使用关税来处理主权事务以及强制使用关税的问题上所展现出的团结力量，这是一种力量的展示，希望我们的**美国**伙伴将来能认识到这对联盟其他成员的重要性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> And yeah, I think the strength of NATO is based on its ability to deter against the threats that we are all commonly facing, some of which North America's is more exposed than our European partners. And when there is instability in terms of relationships in alliance and possibly trust deficits in some areas, nations start hedging and the strength of that predictable trust and coalition unity gets fractured somewhat in places. So, you know, it's really important that we use the strength that that that Europe is bringing to the alliance at the moment, coming together to rearm, coming together to deter Russian aggression. The strength around the unity of towards Greenland's sovereignty that we we keep that momentum building and that dialogue underpins everything that the Alliance does, because that strength is really important now that the Arctic region has become such a geostrategic pathway, that the polar ice melt in the region makes that those swaths of territory much more accessible, much more habitable and much more navigable. So, yeah, I think we're not going to see NATO crumble. It's going through a bit of an awkward moment and some difficult challenges that it has not faced in its history before, but the strength of unity we saw around the issue of Greenland, around the issue of not using tariffs for matters of sovereignty and coercive use of tariffs, was, was, was a show of strength and something that hopefully our US partners are going to see as important to the rest of the Alliance in the future.

</details>

**Ann Fitz-Gerald**: 好的，我们就此打住。Philippe，非常感谢您的见解。我真的很感激。我知道这是我们在 The Rundown 上会继续关注的话题，所以非常感谢您。
