title: 市场反弹信号：从英伟达估值到“黑色星期五”消费热潮
---

### 市场开盘概览：绿色信号与反弹预期

早上好，各位。今天是12月2日，星期二，市场开盘呈现绿色。我们看到了一些反弹迹象，接下来要观察这种反弹能否持续。盘前市场已经转绿，这让我们看到了一线希望。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. We are live. It is Tuesday, December 2nd. Looks like markets are green. Looks like markets are green. We are getting a little bit of a rebound. We're going to see if this rebound can actually hold, but we are getting a bit of a rebound right here in the pre-markets as we end up going green.</p>
</details>

昨天市场其实很想转绿，但不幸的是，比特币从91,000美元跌至83,000美元，这造成了困难。因为比特币在某种程度上是许多其他风险资产的“风险偏好”指标。然而，今天比特币从83,800美元反弹至87,000美元。英伟达（Nvidia）股价突破了181美元，昨天曾跌破180美元，盘前达到181.75美元，上涨了1.09%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, yesterday it kind of felt like the markets really wanted to go green. Unfortunately, you had Bitcoin fall from 91 to 83 and that kind of made it hard as Bitcoin is a bit of a risk-on indicator for a lot of these other risk-on assets to go green. But you got Bitcoin right here rebounding from 838 to 87. You had Nvidia breaking 181. It broke 180 yesterday. 181.75 in the pre-markets. That's up 1.09%.</p>
</details>

昨天有一些公司公布了惊人的财报，比如一家公司股价当天上涨了23%，其**EPS**（Earnings Per Share，即每股收益）超预期约40%，相当惊人。还有Krdo公司上涨了15%。所以昨天有一些不错的财报。今天盘后还会有更多财报公布。ServiceNow、Rocket Lab、Netflix和Apply Digital股价都在上涨。DoorDash昨天上涨了3%，一位内部人士购买了价值一亿美元的股票，这非常罕见，通常看不到这种规模的内部购买。亚马逊今天再次上涨1%，在11月前股价曾达到255美元，现在回到了230美元，期间一度跌至219美元，或许年底能重返250美元的水平。Palantir上涨了1.096%，Hoodie上涨了1.5%，标普500指数上涨了26点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You had some companies that have some amazing earnings yesterday like [ __ ] 23%. On the day they beat EPS by like 40%. It was quite incredible to see uh some of these EP EPS beats. And then you had Krdo that's up 15%. So you had some decent earnings yesterday. We have some more earnings today after the bell. Service Now is up. Rocket Lab's up 1.3%. Netflix is up. Apply Digital's up again. Door Dash, this company was up 3% yesterday. An insider bought a hundred million dollars worth of stock, which was quite incredible. You usually don't see those types of insider buys. Amazon up another 1% today. Amazon was at 255 before November, you know, now it's back at 230, fell all the way to 219, maybe comes back to that 250 level by end of year. And then pounder right here is up 1.096%. Hoodie is up 1.5. S&P up 26.</p>
</details>

所以，今天市场转绿的可能性确实存在，有望重拾上周一、二、三的势头。问题在于，新闻头条是否足够强劲，以及降息预期是否足以让市场继续保持乐观。目前，降息概率为87.4%，高于昨天的86.7%，是几周以来的最高点。我认为，仅比昨天高出1%就向市场发出了一个信号：降息的可能性很大。我们昨天谈到的日本债券收益率问题，虽然我认为它是个问题，但我不确定它是否会成为一个结构性问题，从根本上破坏我们年底前上涨的基础。或许市场目前就是这样定价的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it definitely does seem like there's a shot for us to go green today. Get some of that momentum that we had last week uh from Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. question is going to be are the headlines strong enough uh and is the essentially rate cut expectations going to be enough that gets the market to still feel we have a shot. We are now at 87.4% on rate cut probabilities. Uh this number was 86.7 yesterday. It's the highest it's been in weeks. So the fact that it's up even 1% from yesterday I think is signaling to the market there should be a good shot for that rate cut. And you know the Japanese bond yields we talked about it yesterday. Although I think it's an issue, I don't know if it's like a structural issue that fundamentally ruins the basis for us to have um a rally towards the end of the year and maybe that's how the market is kind of pricing that in right now.</p>
</details>

### 今日焦点：Invest America 法案、黑色星期五数据与地缘政治

我们有很多话题要讨论。今天早上有几个非常有趣的头条新闻。迈克尔·戴尔（Michael Dell）向“Invest America Act”捐赠了62.5亿美元。我们会谈谈这个法案的具体情况。对于不了解的人来说，这基本上是布拉德·格斯特纳（Brad Gersonner）——Altimeter Capital的首席执行官——推动通过的一项政策，它为美国每个新生儿提供1000美元，并直接投资于标普500指数。我非常喜欢这个倡议，而且它获得了两党支持，这简直不可思议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, we got a lot to talk about, a lot to get into. We have a bunch of different headlines this morning that I think are really, really interesting. Um Michael Dell is donating $6.25 billion to the Invest America Act. And we'll talk about kind of what happened uh with Invest America. For those that don't know, this is basically a policy in the big beautiful bill that Brad Gersonner kind of ushered through, CEO of of Ultimate Capital that gives $1,000 to every newborn child uh in America and directly puts it into the S&P 500. I love the initiative. The fact that it was a bipartisanship uh agreement I thought was incredible.</p>
</details>

让孩子们知道自己拥有一点英伟达、一点亚马逊的股份，并以此为动力去学习金融知识，这是一件非常重要的事情。此外，我们还有“黑色星期五”的官方分析数据，来自Shopify、沃尔玛以及整体汇总的数据都相当惊人。如果你认为消费者已经崩溃，这些数据可能会让你改观。消费者可能确实疲软，但从“黑色星期五”的数据来看，除非所有消费都来自信用卡，否则情况似乎没那么糟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, like it's hard for Democrats, Republicans to everything, but like our kids knowing that they have a little bit of Nvidia, a little bit of Amazon, and that being a motivating factor to get them to learn about financial literacy is a very big deal. So, we got that update. We'll talk about uh we have official Black Friday analytics and it's pretty damn incredible across Shopify, Walmart, and then the overall aggreate uh Black Fi Friday, Cyber Monday. Let me know in the chat if anyone bought anything for Cyber Monday, but we have a lot of numbers to look at. And it's quite incredible if you make the argument that the consumer is devastated. The consumer is probably weak, but looking at these Black Friday numbers, if unless all of it's on credit cards, it doesn't feel like it's that weak. So, we'll talk about that as well.</p>
</details>

最后，我们还有一些地缘政治的更新。委内瑞拉发生了很多事情。特朗普昨晚花了很多时间发推文讨论此事。我们会梳理一下，看看这是否会对年底前的市场产生任何影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, and then we have some geopolitical updates. Got a lot of stuff happening in Venezuela. Again, I'm still not fully up to date on this story, but Trump spent time last night tweeting a lot of stuff about it. So, we'll go through it and see if it has any other implications towards the towards the end of the year.</p>

### 深入探讨：Invest America 法案与金融素养

> **视频片段：**
>
> >> 这绝对是一个非常特殊的时刻。我们通过我们的慈善基金，向美国的孩子们投资了62.5亿美元。
>
> >> 明年，每个美国孩子都将能拥有一个由Invest America支持的投资账户。
>
> >> 我们已经看到，当一个孩子即使只获得很小的财务领先优势时，他们的世界会如何扩展。
>
> >> 这些账户真正的力量在于任何人都可以为其注资。父母、亲戚、朋友，每个人都可以帮助塑造一个孩子的未来。
>
> >> 致各位慈善家、公司和社区领袖，如果你们想为我们的孩子、我们的社区、我们的国家做一些真正有意义的事情，请加入我们。
>
> >> 致各位家长和监护人，请保持关注，准备好激活您孩子的账户。每一笔贡献都会随着岁月增长，就像您的孩子一样。我们可以共同努力，让可能性成为每个孩子都能依赖的东西。
>
> >> 这是一个值得投资的未来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Absolutely. It's a very special moment. We're making a $6.25 billion investment in America's kids through our charitable funds.
>> Next year, every American child will be able to get an investment account powered by Invest America.
>> We've seen what happens when a child gets even a small financial head start. Their world expands.
>> The real power of these accounts is that anyone can contribute. Parents, relatives, friends, everyone can help shape a child's future.
>> To philanthropists, companies, community leaders, if you want to be part of something truly meaningful for our kids, for our communities, for our country, join us.
>> And to parents, and caregivers, stay tuned and get ready to activate your child's account. Every contribution can grow over the years just like your child. Together, we can make possibility something every child can count on.
>> And that's a future worth investing in.</p>
</details>

接下来是布拉德·格斯特纳关于这项倡议的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Anyway, here's Brad Gersonner about uh about this announcement.</p>
</details>

> **视频片段：**
>
> >> 你如何给予他们工具，让他们明白如果我继续投资，如果我继续存钱而不是花钱，我最终会达到什么样的高度。
>
> >> 嗯，起点是他们需要能够打开手机，看到自己也参与其中。对吧？如果你一无所有，你的父母也一无所有，就很难对学习金融知识、股票等产生兴趣。现在，每个人都将拥有这个机会。30个州已经要求开设一个学期的金融素养课程。我预计，在未来几个月里，你会听到一些关于州一级金融素养教育融入公共教育的公告。因为现在老师可以说，‘打开你的手机，打开你的Invest America账户，让我们谈谈那些股票意味着什么，拥有股票意味着什么。让我们谈谈复利，谈谈如果你每个月再往那个账户里增加20美元会发生什么。’所以我认为这为我们提供了一个平台，来进行这个国家迫切需要的金融素养和教育。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Fix things. Give money to the people who need it. How do you then give them the tools to understand that if I continue to invest in this, if I continue to put money aside, save instead of spend, this is where I wind up.
>> Well, the place you start is they actually need to be able to open their phone and see that they have a little skin in the game. Right? If you don't have anything and your parents don't have anything, it's hard to get excited about learning about financial literacy, stocks, etc. Now, everybody's going to have that. 30 states already require a semester of financial literacy. I expect and you will hear some announcements in the months ahead about efforts at the state level financial literacy threaded in public education because now the teacher can say open up your phone open up your invest America account let's talk about how those stock what it means to own a stock let's talk about the compounding let's talk about what it would do if you added another 20 bucks a month to that account so I think it gives us a platform for literacy and education around finances that we desperately need in the country</p>
</details>

我真心喜欢这个想法。当布拉德大约一年前提出这个概念，并最终通过法案时，我认为这是一个非凡的构想。你需要有“切身利益”（skin in the game）。我想我们都明白，一旦我们哪怕只拥有一美元的股票，就会感觉自己拥有了这家公司的一部分。这在范式和哲学层面上是一种难以置信的赋权。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> dude I love it I I genuinely love it. I mean, when Brad introduced this idea, uh, I think it was like a year ago and then he got it passed through the big beautiful bill, I thought it was a phenomenal concept and um, I don't know. I I think it makes a lot of sense. You need to have skin in the game. I think all of us understood that once we had even a dollar of a stock uh, which for me literally was like a dollar of a fractional share of a company um, back in 2018, I felt like, wow, I I own part of this. And that is just unbelievably empowering as a paradigmatic and philosophical concept.</p>
</details>

我简直不敢相信我们到现在才开始做这件事。但它正在发生，每年只需花费30亿美元，这简直微不足道。我们花在白宫部分翻修上的钱都比这多。我认为这件事将非常重要，未来五年的每个孩子，希望这个项目能继续延长，都将得到这笔钱，并见证复利的力量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the fact that we are starting this off, I mean, I can't believe we haven't done this earlier than now. But the fact that it's happening, it's only three billion bucks a year. I mean, that's nothing. We spend more on, you know, renovating parts of the White House. So like, the fact that we're doing this, I think, is going to be very important. and every kid for the next 5 years and hopefully this continues to extend is going to get those thousands and see the power of compounding.</p>

### Brad Gersonner 的市场展望：AI 超级周期

布拉德·格斯特纳不仅谈了Invest America，还分享了他对市场的看法。他非常看好这次的AI交易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, not only did Brad Gersonner talk about his thoughts on just Invest America, but he also gave some thoughts on the market. Again, he is heavy on this AI trade. Here is what he had to say about where the state of the markets are as well.</p>
</details>

> **视频片段：**
>
> >> ChatGPT问世快三周年了，我们发展得很快。你看，英伟达在过去三年里增加了近2000亿美元的收入。
>
> >> 这确实是一场非凡的、转型性的阶段性转变，一个正在我们经济中发生的超级周期。它今年为GDP贡献了100个基点，但请记住，今年英伟达经历了两次25%的回调。
>
> >> 当你处于这些阶段性转变的早期时，波动性是难免的，对吧？正是这堵“忧虑之墙”阻止了大家所担心的泡沫形成。看看今天的市盈率，以英伟达为例，我认为它明年的完全税后市盈率在23到24倍之间，2027年则是18倍。这不是泡沫的构成要素。
>
> >> 我认为“科技七巨头”的其他公司市盈率都在25到30倍之间。也许Meta的市盈率是21倍。所以对我来说，稍微降降温，进行一些这样的对话和辩论，是非常健康的。我现在看到的是，在模型方面取得了巨大进展，但我认为其扩散速度，即这项技术改变消费者和企业生活的速度，是需要时间的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> We're coming up on the third anniversary of Chat GPT. We've come a long way fast. Um, you know, you've seen Nvidia add almost $200 billion dollars of revenue in the last three years.
>> Truly extraordinary transformational phase shift. uh super cycle going on in our economy. It added 100 basis points to GDP this year, but remember this year we had two 25% draw downs in in Nvidia.
>> Right. And so there's going to be volatility when you're early in these phase shifts, right? That's that wall of worry prevents the bubble that everybody's worried about. And when you look at the multiples today, take Nvidia for example. I think it's trading at 23 24 times fully taxed earnings on next year's numbers. 18 times on 27 numbers. That is not the stuff that bubbles are made of, right?
>> I think the rest of the mag 7 all trades somewhere between 25 and 30 times. Um maybe meta is at 21 times uh earnings. So to me, taking a little of the gas out, having some of these uh uh you know, conversations and debate very healthy. Um, and what I see out there right now is a tremendous amount of progress on the model side, but I think the diffusion, how the rate at which this transforms lives, both consumer lives and enterprise, that takes time.</p>
</details>

> >> 是的，这正是我要谈的。新版的Gemini比ChatGPT更好吗？
>
> >> 它非常棒。记住，一年前我们还认为谷歌出局了。我在推特和其他地方都说过，我们持有谷歌。在这里很难选出赢家，所以你可以全部都持有。你可以持有OpenAI和Anthropic，也可以持有谷歌和微软。我认为在这个阶段，你可能应该这样做。我认为谷歌做得非常出色。
>
> >> 这对技术支出是好事。但对于商业世界，对于企业来说，这意味着什么，还有很多问题。昨天，黄仁勋在节目中谈到了他们与Synopsis的交易。听到这些大型工业公司如何利用这项技术来实现下一步发展，非常有趣。黄仁勋提出了一个我认为很有趣的观点，即90%的准确率对于消费者来说是可以接受的，但如果你在处理任何大型企业问题时，这是不可接受的。
>
> >> 没错。想想看，制造机器的机器，对吧？这才是他真正谈论的。我们从特斯拉和埃隆那里看到了这一点。埃隆过去常说，在我们首先造出机器之前，我们无法在电动汽车领域达到我们需要的目标。这是一种全新的汽车制造方式，可以降低成本。这就是你看到黄仁勋在谈论的，例如在芯片设计领域。你真正地将AI注入整个工业经济中。所有这些好处都摆在我们面前。我认为我们正在进入一个非常显著的生产力繁荣期。我曾谈到，对于美国许多可以“事半功倍”的工业和其他公司来说，这是一个利润率扩张的黄金时代。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, yes, and that's what I was going to get to. Is the new version of Gemini better than ChatgPT?
>> It's terrific. It's terrific. Remember a year ago we were counting uh you know Google out of the equation. I've said on Twitter and otherwise we own Google. Yeah. Um I've said it's very difficult to pick a winner here. So you can own them all. You can own OpenAI and Enthropic. You can own Google uh and and Microsoft. Um and I think at this phase you know you probably should do that. I think Google's done an incredible job.
>> That that's great for the technology spending. There are a lot of questions about what this means for the business world too for enterprise. Um, yesterday Jensen Wong was on SWAT on the street with Jim Kramer talking a little bit about that deal that they did with Synopsis. That was pretty interesting to hear how it's got to be able to be used by these big industrial companies to be able to really make the next steps. And Jensen made the point that I thought was really interesting that 90% accuracy is okay if you're dealing with consumers. It is not okay if you're in any of these big enterprise issues.
>> That's right. That's right. Think about it this way. The machine that builds the machine, right? That's really what he's talking about. We saw that with Tesla and Elon, right? Elon used to talk about we can't get to where we need to get to with electric cars until we first build the machine, right? A totally new way to manufacture cars that can drive down the cost. And that's what you see Jensen talking about, for example, in the design of chips, right? That you really imbue the entire industrial economy with AI. And all of those benefits lie before us. I think we're going we're heading into a very significant productivity boom. I've talked about the golden age of margin expansion for a lot of industrial and other companies in America that can simply do more with less.</p>
</details>

> >> 你谈论的是那个周期中脱颖而出的赢家。Pets.com也曾有过很大的波动性，顺便说一句，那些公司都破产了。
>
> >> 在这个周期中，也会有公司破产。硅谷有上千家估值超过十亿美元的公司正在试图融资。对它们来说，这不会同样容易。但我认为这是创造性破坏过程的一部分。有些公司无法成功，这是可以接受的。
>
> >> 我们今天早上早些时候谈到了孙正义的一些评论，他说他不想卖掉他全部的英伟达股份，但他必须这样做，以便能投资OpenAI。你对这两家公司都有押注。你对此有何看法？
>
> >> 我希望我在OpenAI的赌注能像孙正义那么大。
>
> >> 你会为此牺牲你在英伟达的赌注吗？
>
> >> 不会。就像我说的，英伟达一直是一个非凡的赢家。我们在2022年12月投资了英伟达，就在我们看到ChatGPT之后。在那段时间里，随着收入从每年约300亿美元增长到超过2000亿美元，股价上涨了超过10倍。他们刚刚告诉我们，到明年年底，我们应该预期运行率达到1000亿美元。与此同时，Broadcom也表现得非常出色。Hock Tan与谷歌合作构建TPU7所做的事情是非凡的。这将迫使英伟达变得更好。所以我认为我们已经看到了很多赢家，你可以从Altimeter拥有的公司标志中看到。我们的选择实际上是持有许多从这个超级周期中受益的最佳公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> You're talking about the winners that came out of that. There was a lot of volatility in Pets.com too. And by the way, those companies went bust
>> and there are going to be companies in this cycle that go bust. There are a thousand companies in Silicon Valley valued over a billion dollars that are trying to raise money. It's not going to be equally easy for all of them, right? But I think that's part of the process of creative destruction, right? It's okay that you know that some companies aren't going to make it.
>> We talked earlier this morning about some comments from Masasan who said that he didn't want to sell his entire Nvidia stake, but he had to in order to be able to put it into OpenAI. You've got bids on bets on both of those companies. Yes. What do you think about that?
>> I wish my bet in OpenAI was as big as MASS, but you know, you
>> would you sacrifice your Nvidia bet for it?
>> No. Like I like I said, Nvidia has been an extraordinary winner. We invested in Nvidia in December of 22, right after we saw Chat GBT. The stocks up over 10 10 times uh 10x over that period of time as the revenue went from roughly $30 billion a year to over $200 billion a year. And they just told us that we should expect a run rate by the end of next year of hundred billion. And this is at the same time that Broadcom is doing extraordinarily well. What Hocktan has done partnering with Google to build out TPU7 is extraordinary. That's going to force Nvidia to be even better. So I think we've seen a lot of a lot of winners and you can see from the logos that Alttimeter owns. Our choice has been really to own a lot of the best names that are benefiting from this super cycle.</p>

### AI 市场动态与数据中心建设

摩根士丹利昨天为他们的亚洲客户做了一份报告，这些客户购买英伟达芯片。报告称：“我们相信，客户未来12个月最大的焦虑是他们能否采购到足够的英伟达产品，特别是Vera Rubin型号。”他们还说：“我们继续坚定地相信，英伟达将在大多数应用中拥有最佳的经济效益。”基本上，市场在担心泡沫，而摩根士丹利则表示，他们的客户担心的不是泡沫，而是能否拿到芯片，因为他们知道英伟达的积压订单有多严重。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Morgan Stanley did a report for their clients yesterday for their Asia customers or from their Asia contacts that buy Nvidia chips and they said we believe the customer's biggest anxiety for the next 12 months is their ability to procure enough Nvidia product generally and Vera Rubin specifically and then they said we continue to have an unwavering belief that Nvidia will have the best economics for most applications. Essentially, the market's worrying about a bubble and Morgan Stanley's like, "Dude, when we talk to customers, they're not worried about a bubble. They're worried about just getting the chips because they know how hard it is because of the backlog that Nvidia has."</p>
</details>

你看到**高贝塔**（High Beta: 指波动性高于整个市场基准的股票）名称与那些基本面强劲的公司之间出现了分化。像Big Bear AI这样的股票，曾一度涨到8.5美元，现在很难再回去了。同样，像Hood、Palantir、Tesla等股票也很难回到之前的高点。当像Tesla或AMD这样的公司重回历史高点时，其他一些高贝塔股票是否也能跟上？如果不能，我认为这只是市场在说我们需要一次洗牌。我们淘汰了所有泡沫，这虽然痛苦，但理论上那些盈利能支撑其估值的公司应该会回来，而其他一些公司可能没有回升的火力，这也没关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What you're seeing here is a divergence between a lot of the high beta names like a Big Bear AI that got up to like 8 850. That's not easily getting back there again. Same thing with Hood not easily getting back to 150. Pounder not easily getting back to 200. Tesla not easily getting back to 460. And so you're seeing some of these names kind of recover their momentum. And I wonder, you know, when Tesla does get back to 460 or AMD does get back to 260, does a big bear get back to 850? When certain stocks make their all-time highs, do some of these other names, is an Oaklo ever get back to, you know, 198. And if that doesn't happen, I think that's the market just saying we needed a flush out. We had a lot of things that were running. Uh a lot of those runs didn't make a ton of sense. When you looked at the earnings growth, we flushed everything out, which was painful for all of us, even if you own some of the most important companies and not just the pure high beta names. And those companies theoretically should come back because their earnings matches their multiple whereas some of these other names might not have the firepower to come back, which is okay.</p>

关于数据中心建设，A16Z的一份报告显示，美国的数据中心正在迅速扩张，主要使用天然气。摩根士丹利今天早上也发布了另一份报告，他们认为生成式AI在未来三年需要约72吉瓦的电力，而目前只有约10吉瓦得到满足，还有47吉瓦的缺口。这需要大量的投资、基础设施和建设。《华尔街日报》昨天的一篇文章称，建筑业工作岗位正以惊人的速度回归，原因就是建设数据中心需要大量工人。

<p class="english-text">I mean take a look at a couple of charts right here just on the concept of data centers. You've had a lot more analysis done as well. This is from A16Z AI data center capacity. In the United States data centers are getting really big really quickly specifically from using natural gas. Morgan Stanley put out another report this morning as well. They think that most of the gap gets bridged, the gap between energy and the ability to actually get these data centers online uh by time to power solutions rather than the normal grid Q. You had a Wall Street Journal piece yesterday saying that construction jobs are starting to come back at a massive pace and the reason for those jobs coming back is because to build out data centers, you need a lot of workers and we don't have humanoid robots yet to build out the data center.</p>
</details>

另一张图表显示，吉瓦级数据中心可能在两年或更短时间内建成。同样，这需要大量的工作岗位。如果是这样，英伟达、Nabius等与此相关的公司，即使在对AI泡沫的担忧中，可能仍然是最好的投资标的之一。布拉德·格斯特纳说得也对，你需要那些对AI泡沫感到恐惧的人，才能让价格走高。如果每个人都兴高采烈，英伟达现在可能已经300美元了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">There's another chart right here saying that gigawatt scale data centers can likely be built in two years or less. Again, that would take a lot of jobs to be able to make it happen. And if that's the case, Nvidia, Nabius, a lot of these names associated with the trade probably still end up being some of the some of the better names even in the midst of concerns of an AI bubble. And Brad Gerson was also right that you need those concerns. Like you really need those people being so scared of an AI bubble to get things to go higher because if everyone was euphoric in video, it would be $300 right now.</p>

### 企业动态：AMD、Robinhood 及其他

AMD宣布与惠普（HP）扩大合作，开发下一代开放、可扩展的AI基础设施。惠普将成为首批提供新款AMD机架级产品的供应商之一。这或许解释了为什么AMD在盘前受到追捧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">AMD has announced an expanded partnership with HP to develop the next generation of open scalable AI infrastructure. HP will be one of the first providers of the new AMD rack scale. Okay, that also probably explains why AMD is getting some love right here in the pre-markets.</p>
</details>

Robinhood宣布，**ISA**（Individual Savings Account: 英国的一种免税个人储蓄账户）将于1月26日在英国推出。此外，他们昨天宣布，预测市场的合约量已超过95亿份，仅11月份就达到30亿份，比10月份增长了20%。他们将在12月16日举办一场关于AI和预测市场的线上活动。这似乎表明他们非常重视预测市场，其增长速度惊人。如果明年加密货币波动性不佳，预测市场可能会成为另一个收入来源，抵消部分影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Robin did announce ISAs are going to be coming January 26 to the UK. So for all the Brits out there that have been holding off because Robinet didn't offer an ISA. Uh looks like they are getting that done and that's going to be very exciting. The other big announcement uh yesterday from Robin is that prediction markets have now exceeded 9.5 billion contracts, three billion alone in October or sorry in November uh which is up 20% from October. Uh, and they're having a new event on December 16th. It's going to be online and it's going to cover AI and prediction markets. We thought it was just going to be an AI event, but it's actually AI and prediction markets. So, it seems like they're taking prediction markets very seriously. The growth is obviously incredibly rapid. And if crypto volatility is bad next year, and we don't have a crypto run, there's another source of revenue now that can maybe offset that with prediction markets.</p>

### 地缘政治观察：委内瑞拉与关税争议

关于委内瑞拉，特朗普昨晚发布了大量相关内容，包括一些关于马杜罗的AI视频。与此同时，一个重要的相关动态是，好市多（Costco）正在就关税问题起诉特朗普政府，最高法院预计本月底将对此案做出裁决。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, Venezuela update on Venezuela. So, Trump tweeted a lot of stuff over the night on Venezuela, including like some AI videos of Maduro. Let's get an update on what happened with Venezuela and then we'll talk about some of the implications of that as well. This is actually the the tariff update, but we'll talk more about Venezuela in a bit. But this is also really important and potentially implicates Venezuela. So Costco is suing the Trump administration about tariffs and we're going to get the Supreme Court deal on tariffs probably by the end of this month as well.</p>
</details>

好市多要求美国国际贸易法院宣布，根据《国际紧急经济权力法》征收关税是非法的，并要求禁止进一步征收关税，以及全额退还今年根据该法规支付的所有关税。白宫发言人昨天表示：“未能维护特朗普总统合法关税的经济后果是巨大的，这起诉讼凸显了这一事实。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Costco is asking the US Court of International Trade for a declaration that collecting tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, as the Trump administration has done in many cases, is actually illegal. and the company wants an injunction blocking further duties as well as a full refund of all tariffs paid under the statute this year. A White House spokesman said yesterday, "The economic consequences of the failure to uphold President Trump's lawful tariffs are enormous, and this suit highlights that fact."</p>
</details>

这带来了两个叙事：从委内瑞拉的角度看，任何合法的冲突都对油价不利。目前油价处于60美元以下的良好位置，如果能保持，通胀就不是大问题。其次，如果最高法院推翻特朗普政府的关税政策，这可能对市场有利，因为市场从来不喜欢关税。但这又与特朗普依赖关税作为谈判筹码的策略相悖。这些因素是否足以在市场中制造更多看跌情绪？不一定，但我认为它们会增加不确定性和混乱，可能导致一些看跌情绪。然而，美联储降息和盈利周期可能足以压倒这些负面因素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you have two kind of narratives from a Venezuela perspective which would be bad for oil and then from a Trump tariff perspective that could potentially be good for the markets because I don't think the market ever liked tariffs but be counterintuitive for Trump's negotiations that all were contingent on tariffs as the lynch pin. are those enough to create more bearish sentiment in the market? No. I think it creates more uncertainty and confusion which could lead to uh some bearishness. But the Fed cutting rates and the earning cycle I think is enough to overpower it.</p>

### “黑色星期五”数据强劲，挑战“消费者疲软”论

沃尔玛的“黑色星期五”数据相当疯狂。与去年相比，今年“黑色星期五”来自商店的订单增加了57%，三小时内送达的订单增加了44%。最快的一单仅用时10分钟。AirPods第四代和55英寸海信4K电视是沃尔玛最畅销的商品之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so Black Friday, what happened? Walmart's Black Friday. These numbers are kind of crazy. 57% more orders from stores on Black Friday this year than last year. 44% more orders delivered in under three hours. The fastest delivery on Black Friday arrived in just 10 minutes. Uh AirPods generation 4 and the 55 inch high sense 4K TV were some of the largest sellers for uh Walmart and Walmart marketplace set a new single day conversion record with PlayStation 5s and Laboos apparently flying off virtual shelves.</p>
</details>

“黑色星期五”的销售额简直令人难以置信。我们看到了沃尔玛的数据，稍后可能会得到亚马逊的数据。Shopify的数据显示，销售额同比增长25%，达到62亿美元。这些数字都非常惊人。我们正在挑战“消费者疲软”的说法，用数据显示消费者可能并不像我们想象的那么弱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But uh Black Friday sales were incredible. I mean just incredible. So you're seeing the Walmart numbers right here. We're going to get the Amazon numbers probably a little bit later today. Uh they did say that Rufus, their LLM, was helping them s in a sophisticated way really influence customer decisions. And then we saw the the Shopify numbers where we had 25% year-over-year earnings, not earnings growth, sales growth, 6.2 billion and 32 million requests per second for Shopify's API. I mean, these are just incredible numbers. I feel like we're challenging this consumers week narrative and it's important important to challenge that narrative. If you have the data that shows that maybe the consumer is not as weak as we think.</p>
</details>

Adobe Analytics今天也发布数据称，在为期五天的感恩节购物期间，消费总额达到442亿美元，创下历史新高。这似乎表明消费者的势头和增长比预期的要强劲得多，这未必是坏事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Even uh Adobe Analytics came out today and they said uh 44.2 billion was spent during the 5day Thanksgiving shopping period, which is a record over these 5 days. So, it it just it just feels like there's a lot more momentum and growth in the consumer, and that's not necessarily the the worst thing in the world.</p>

### SEC 主席讲话：让 IPO 再次伟大

美国证券交易委员会（SEC）主席保罗·阿特金斯（Paul Atkins）谈到了“让IPO再次伟大”的目标。他表示，他们正在研究三件事：一是现代化规则手册，确保法规适用，帮助大小公司吸引资本；二是审视诉讼情况，处理那些阻碍公司上市的无聊诉讼；三是解决公司治理问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I think the takeaway from Paul Atkins as he's talking about making IPOs great again is that he is going to do whatever it takes to continue getting the market to be in a strong position. And they're basically three things that we're looking at to try to make IPOs great again. One is to modernize our rule book to make sure that our regulations are fit for purpose uh to help small companies and large companies uh attract capital. Second is to look at our litigation situation uh you know with respect to you know the strike suits and and other sorts of frivolous um actions that really impede I think uh you know people from wanting to be public and then finally the corporate governance uh issues that you were alluding to.</p>
</details>

一个大的悬念是，明年我们是否还会有季度财报电话会议。SEC曾提议每年只举行两次。如果他们真的推行这一提议，可能会对2026年产生重大影响。我不认为这很可能发生，即使发生，最早也要到2027年，因为这对公司来说是一个巨大的变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the the big mystery is are we still going to get quarterly earnings calls next year? Uh the SEC did propose that we would have them only two times a year. Hopefully, that proposal is not taken that seriously and they kind of just forget about it and, you know, maybe say, "Oh, maybe that's not the best idea." But if they do take it seriously, that could be a major change for 2026. I don't think it's likely. If it were to happen, I think it would be 2027 at the earliest because that's a big change for companies.</p>

### 市场心理学：迈克尔·伯里的空头立场

关于迈克尔·伯里（Michael Burry）做空特斯拉的传闻，他本人并未确认。他只是说特斯拉的估值高得离谱。我认为，伯里现在正在经历一种心理状态，他想重温2008年站在世界之巅的感觉。加拿大哲学家兼说唱歌手德雷克（Drake）有句歌词：“有时候我想回到过去，不是为了重做某些事，而是为了再次体验它们。”我认为伯里现在就是这样，他想重温那种感觉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">also people that are saying Bur is short Tesla, uh, I don't think that's confirmed. Uh, there's a fortune headline this morning saying Bur short Tesla. Uh, but from Bur Substack, he never said he was short. He just said Tesla's ridiculously overvalued. I think you know the psychoanalysis on Bur that that we talked about last time like yesterday he posted a letter from 2008 that he said it's actually a really good letter. I think he really wants to experience that again. Um there there's this line by uh American philosopher rapper Drake. Actually, he's Canadian as well. So Canadian, this is this is this is one of the reasons I I I love Canada. But he said uh sometimes I would like to go back in life not to redo things but to experience them twice. And so and that's a very profound line when you think about it because a lot of people have regrets in life that they want to go back and redo certain things in their life so that they can change the trajectory of how their life turned out. You have this Canadian philosopher coming out saying I don't want to go back to redo it. I want to go back to relive the experience and feel it twice. And I think I I I think that's what Bur is going through right now. I think he wants to relive being on top of the world.</p>
</details>

他认为现在是重拾2008年荣耀的机会。我只是不确定与AI革命作对是否是正确的做法。但可以说，除了互联网泡沫时期，现在是公开看空一个庞大、复杂的基础设施生态系统的最佳时机，因为从未有过如此宏大的概念。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's why I think he's getting so aggressive here. The depreciation argument, again, I I I've started to look into I really think the depreci depreciation argument is stupid. Like, I really do not think that's a meaningful argument. So, I don't think that's going to be the one that gets him there. Maybe there's something else. Now, he's talking about Nvidia stockbased compensation. I'm like, I don't I don't know. I don't think those are the best arguments.</p>

### 实时市场动态与总结

在直播期间，亚马逊发布了其最新的AI芯片Tranium 3，并宣布其性能和价格都优于前代产品，旨在与英伟达竞争。这一消息导致英伟达股价出现小幅回调，而亚马逊股价则上涨。与此同时，比特币价格突破9万美元，部分原因是Vanguard平台开始允许客户交易比特币ETF，且首日交易量巨大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amazon just unveiled that its newest AI chips are now available for customers. Is Amazon having a live stream? Are we do we have Amazon live anywhere? Yeah, these announcements are definitely getting the market to be more excited about Tranium. The fact that Amazon and Apple are making a move right here. Again, I don't think this is bearish in video, but nonetheless, the headline is always going to be thought of as bearish in video. Bitcoin is also pumping. Are we at 92? No, still at 91. We hit 91.2. Did not hit 92 yet, but it's trying to get there. Wow. Bitcoin ETF's volume on Vanguard hit a billion within the first 30 minutes. Oh, that's that's a big update.</p>
</details>

特朗普总统随后举行了内阁会议直播，在会议开场白中，他强调了本届政府在经济、边境安全和降低通胀方面取得的成就，并严厉批评了美联储主席。他重申了减税政策，并预告明年将是史上最大的退税季。这些言论，加上降息预期和强劲的消费数据，共同描绘了一幅对市场相对有利的宏观图景。尽管存在波动，但整体趋势似乎支持投资者继续持有市场头寸。

<p class="english-text">It was like the rest of the country. It was in disrepair. One year ago, our country was dead and said to me by many leaders, we had a dead country. Now we have the hottest country anywhere in the world. The stock market is set 46 all-time highs. And this last Friday, which is called Black Friday, was the biggest ever online sales that there's ever been by a lot. More Americans are working today than in any time in the history of our country. I mean, these are the facts we have to get out. Next year is projected to be the largest tax refund season ever. And we're going to be giving back refunds out of the tariffs because we've taken in literally trillions of dollars.</p>
