summary: AQR 联合创始人 Cliff Asness 深入探讨了他的“欠有效市场假说”。他认为，过去十年，市场变得越来越容易出现非理性行为的爆发。Asness
  将此现象归因于两大因素：一是被动投资的兴起，导致进行资产定价的参与者减少；二则更为关键，是社交媒体的崛起，它破坏了群体决策的独立性，将“群体智慧”扭曲为“乌合之众的疯狂”。文章还探讨了作为理性投资者在非理性市场中面临的挑战、散户投资者的影响、AI
  在量化投资中的应用，以及多策略与多管理人模式的区别。

### 播客十周年与市场的变迁

Tracy Alloway：大家好，欢迎收听新一期的《Odd Lots》播客。我是 Tracy Alloway。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to another episode of the Odd Lots podcast. I'm Tracy Alloway.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：我是 Joe Weisenthal。Joe，这个月对我们来说意义重大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I'm Joe Weisenthal. Joe It's a big month for us.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway：是啊，这个月很重要。我们做这个播客已经十年了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a big month for us. We've been doing this for ten years.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：是啊，真不敢相信。你还记得第一期节目吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I know, I can't believe it. Do you remember the first episode?</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway：当然记得，是和 Tom Keene 一起录的。然后我们的第二期节目，我记得好像是关于香蕉的，不知道为什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Of course, with, Tom Keene. Yeah. And then our second episode, I think, was about bananas. For some reason, it was. You're right.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：我们花了很长时间才搞清楚自己在做什么。我当时也没想到我们能做十年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It took us a long time, to figure out what we were doing. It took us a long time to figure out what we were doing, and I don't think I would have that point. I would have expected that we'd be doing it ten years.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway：我当时就想着在广播录音室里打开麦克风聊一会儿。我们开始做播客是因为想和有趣的人交谈。我觉得我们很幸运（hashtag blessed），在很长一段时间里都没什么人听，这给了我们足够长的时间去摸索。所以我们是幸运的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know. I was expecting, I think, turning on a microphone in a radio studio and talking for a while. Oh, we started doing it because we wanted to have a podcast and talk to interesting people. I think we were hashtag blessed that no one was listening for a very, very long time, which gave us a long runway to figure things out. So we got lucky.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：话虽如此，十年确实是一段很长的时间。在这期间，很多事情都变了。有时候变化之大令人难以置信。我们之前也聊过，感觉我们当时报道的资本和新闻事件，现在已经成了大写的“历史”。那些我们曾习以为常的事情，比如人们担心希腊主权债务危机会导致世界末日，现在的人们已经不记得了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That said, you know, ten years. It is, in fact, a long time to be doing this. And a lot has changed in that period. A lot has changed in that period. Sometimes mind blowing. And it really, you know, I feel like and we've talked about this before for sure, but the thing that we were covering is capital and news at the time are now capital H history. And it's like these things that are we sort of take for granted. Everyone was there was like no children. Let us tell you what it was like in the old days when, you know, people were worried the world was going to come to an end because, you know, Greece is sovereign debt and all this stuff that we just sort of part of the landscape, but people don't remember it.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway：其中之一肯定是**价值投资**（Value Investing: 一种投资策略，旨在寻找并买入价格低于其内在价值的股票）或基本面投资的理念，对吧？我们可以跟年轻人讲讲过去价格还很重要的日子，投资者对高价股的追捧是有限度的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, one of those things has to be the idea of value or fundamental investing, right? Like, let us tell you about the days when price actually mattered. Letters had a limit to what investors would pile into.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：没错。我们可以聊聊过去人们还讨论市盈率（PE ratios）的日子。“哦，这只股票市盈率 25 倍了，我们最好卖掉它，去买那只 15 倍市盈率的股票。”这种想法现在感觉很古朴。也许有一天会回归，但就目前而言，考虑到市场上很多事情，那些格雷厄姆和多德（Graham and Dodd，价值投资的鼻祖）的东西感觉有点过时了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, that's exactly right. Let us talk about the days when people used to talk about PE ratios. This stock oh it's at a 20 5BE. We better sell it and buy the stock at two £0.15 or whatever. Yes, that feels quaint. Maybe it'll be back there one day. But for now, given how many things in the market seem to be, some of these, the Grandma and Dodd kind of stuff, it feels a little old. A little old fashioned.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway：是的，有点老派。在我们做播客的这十年里，出现的一个大主题是，似乎每个人都变得更“蠢”了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Little old fashioned. Yeah. Okay. So one of the big themes that has emerged in the ten years that we've been doing this podcast is, everyone seems to have grown more stupid.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：希望这和我们没什么关系，不是相关性问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would say, hopefully that's not related. It's not like a correlation thing.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway：好吧，有可能是。但你看，投资的游戏化，人们赌价格线上涨或下跌，赌各种随机的 Meme 币。我们在播客里经常讨论这个，但这确实是市场的一个根本性转变。如果你认为市场应该是关于资本配置的，关于激励机制的对齐，人们投资是因为他们认为某样东西在未来能以合适的价格盈利。但现在，人们只是因为别人都在买而跟风涌入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It, it could be all right. But, you know, we have all this gamification of investing, people betting on lines going up. Yeah. Or down, people betting on random meme coins, things like that. And I think, you know, we talk about it a lot on the podcast, but this is actually a fundamental shift in the market. If you think about the market as something that's supposed to be about capital allocation. Yeah, alignment of incentives. People are investing in something because they think it's going to be profitable in the future at the right price. And now people are just sort of piling into stuff because other people are doing it.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：归根结底，我内心深处仍然相信，股票的价值应该反映其净现值。我知道你是个**有效市场假说**（Efficient Market Hypothesis, EMH: 一种经济学理论，认为资产价格已完全反映所有可得信息）的支持者，但面对现在的一些现象，这有点难。另一件变化是，我们现在大概一半的节目都或多或少与人工智能（AI）有关。所以，我认为现在有很多有趣的事情正在发生，特别是在科技与投资的交叉领域，既包括投资科技，也包括将科技应用于投资等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And again, line go up deep down, I still believe that the value of a stock should reflect the net present value. I know you're an MH guy, but I've, it's been a little bit hard with, some of these things and, you know, the other thing too, that is sort of change is that like half of our episodes these days are kind of AI related in some way. And so I think there's a lot of interesting stuff going on, particularly at the intersection of tech and applying tech to both investing in tech, but then the application of tech to investing and so forth.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway：是的，变化太大了。我们请到了一位完美的嘉宾来谈论这些年大家是如何变得越来越“蠢”的。我们即将对话的是我们一直非常想邀请上节目的人，我对此非常兴奋。他就是 AQR 的联合创始人兼首席投资官 Cliff Asness。非常感谢你来到《Odd Lots》。

### “欠有效市场假说”的诞生

主持人：Cliff，作为一个理性的人生活在一个非理性的世界里是什么感觉？你已经这样做了很长时间了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's it like to be a rational person living in an irrational world class? Yeah, you've been doing it for a long time.</p>
</details>

Cliff Asness：嗯，“理性的人”并不总是别人对我的评价。理性投资和个人生活中的理性行为是有区别的，我们得区分开来。你们在开场白里说的，让我对接下来的一个小时有点害怕，因为你们几乎把我三分之一想说的话都说了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, a rational person is not always how I'm described, but there's rational investing, and then there's rational conduct in your personal life. So let's just distinguish those, you guys in your intro said like, it's a little it's a little scary for the next hour because you said like a third of the things I want to say.</p>
</details>

我曾在《投资组合管理杂志》（Journal of Portfolio Management）50周年纪念刊上发表了一篇相当长的文章。他们邀请了一些老家伙写回顾性文章，我写的那篇叫做《欠有效市场假说》（The Less Efficient Market Hypothesis）。你们可能知道，我的博士论文导师是尤金·法马（Eugene Fama），一个不怎么出名的人。我给他当了两年助教，在有效市场假说（EMH）的环境中长大。你们说 EMH 观众就能懂，这对我来说可不常见。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I wrote a rather, you know, gigantic piece in the Journal of Portfolio Management. They were having a 50th anniversary. None of us were quite old enough to have been there in the first issue, but they were looking for the old guys to write kind of retrospectives. And the piece I wrote was called The Less Efficient Market Hypothesis. And now I think you guys probably know this, but my dissertation advisor was, a little known guy named Eugene Fama we've heard of, I was his Ta for two years. I grew up in MH. I love that you guys should say MH and your audience knows. Yeah, what you're talking about. That is not the norm for me. When I, when I, when I talk about these things,</p>
</details>

即使在当时，我也不是一个完美的有效市场论者。顺便说一句，Gene 也不是。他不是一个狂热分子。我记得大概上课第三周，他总是告诉学生，市场几乎肯定不是完全有效的，因为 Gene 是个聪明人，他知道“完美”是个很蠢的想法。他可能认为市场比我现在认为的要有效得多，而我可能认为市场比一般散户交易者认为的要有效。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was not a perfect, efficient marketer even back then. Neither is Gene, by the way. Gene, Gene's not a zealot. Yeah, well, he about third week of class. I know that's because I took the class three times I didn't fail, but as the ta, I sat through it, three full years. And like, the third week, he always tells the class markets are almost certainly not perfectly efficient because genes are brilliant guy and recognizes that perfection is a really stupid idea. He's been on the show, by the way. Oh, I didn't okay. Yeah, yeah. And I don't know if that came up, but he's always very honest about that. He probably thinks they're considerably more efficient than I do these days. And I think I probably think it's they're more efficient than then maybe the active average retail trader.</p>
</details>

我为他写了一篇关于**价格动量**（Price Momentum: 一种投资策略，认为近期上涨的资产在未来短期内会继续上涨，反之亦然）成功性的博士论文。这可不是一篇典型的法马式论文。典型的法马式论文应该是：我研究了价格动量，发现它亏得一塌糊涂，而华尔街那些白痴还在用它。但他对此非常开明。我记得我当时含糊地说想写一篇关于价格动量的论文，而且我发现它效果很好。他只是说：“如果数据里有，就写出来。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I wrote a dissertation for him on the success of price momentum. That is not a very gene Fama dissertation. A gene Fama dissertation is I've studied price momentum and it loses gobs of money. And these idiots on Wall Street do it anyway. That's kind of a fishing market. Look how silly they are. And he was great about it. I remember I kind of mumbled, I'm like, I want to write a dissertation on price momentum. And by the way, I. I find it works very well. What was that? Cliff? It works very well. What was that? Cliff? It works very well. And he said, if it's in the data, write the paper.</p>
</details>

所以，从那时起，我就已经离有效市场理论有了一些距离。价格动量通常被认为是市场非理性的一个指标。它之所以有效，可能有两个原因。一是因为反馈循环，就像你们之前说的“追涨杀跌”，人们涌入，这与现实关联不大，只是追逐回报。但它也可能因为行为金融学所说的“反应不足”（underreaction）而有效。当消息出来，价格应该上涨某个幅度，但我们（学术界和私人研究者）发现，价格通常会朝正确的方向移动，但不会一步到位。所以如果你据此交易，后面还有一些上涨空间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I've drifted at least a little bit further from efficient markets, even way back then, now price momentum. I'll do a lot of Segways. You're going to have to stop. No, that's great. That's fine. I do parenthetical within parenthetical price. Momentum is often thought of as this index of irrationality. It can work for two different reasons. It can work because of yes, feedback loops. Chasing line goes up, just like you said before, and people pour in, which isn't very connected to reality. It's just chasing returns. But it can also work, because of what the behavioral finance people would call under reaction. News comes out that should move the price by so and so. On average, we have found they say we it's the royal we of academia and private researchers that the price moves in the right direction but doesn't move all the way. So if you trade on that, there's still a little bit to go.</p>

### 两次泡沫的亲身经历

在 AQR 成立之初，也就是 1998 年，我们在高盛（Goldman Sachs）取得了辉煌的业绩后创办了公司。我们第一个月业绩就很好，那是在 1998 年 8 月，当时因为俄罗斯债务危机，标普指数下跌了 20%。我们当时还在击掌庆祝，因为我们说自己是**市场中性**（Market Neutral: 一种投资策略，旨在通过同时持有多头和空头头寸来消除市场系统性风险，从而获得与市场走向无关的回报），在市场崩盘时我们还略有上涨。这是我得到的众多教训中的第一个：在这个行业里，永远不要过早击掌庆祝。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But here's here's what I observed in the very beginning of acre AQR launched in 1998 after we had a fabulous run at Goldman Sachs. Is this survivorship bias? And this you don't get to start your own billion dollar hedge fund unless you have a fabulous run at Goldman Sachs or something. Equivalent. We had a good first month. You know, the story is going to go and you say you had a good first month, right? And then that first month, by the way, was August of of 1998, when the S&P was down 20% on the Russian debt crisis. And we're doing high fives, like we say, we're market neutral and we're up a little bit in a crash. And it was my first of many lessons, never too high, five in this business, when you fully retire and divest, you get one high five now.</p>
</details>

接下来的 18 个月是著名的**互联网泡沫**（Dot-com bubble: 指 1990 年代末期，由互联网相关公司的投机行为驱动的股市泡沫）的高潮期。那段时期对我们并不友好，尤其是因为我们一开始就设立了一只极具进取性的市场中性基金。动量策略在泡沫中有所帮助，但价值策略则被彻底摧毁，而那在当时是我们模型的主要部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the next 18 months was the crescendo of the famous dot.com or tech bubble. And that was not kind to us. It was particularly not kind because we decided to start with a extremely aggressive, market neutral fund. So momentum helped, as you can imagine, in a bubble. But value was just destroyed and that was most of the model back then.</p>
</details>

我们当时发明了一个衡量廉价股和昂贵股之间价差的指标。之前没人问过这个问题：它们到底有多便宜或多贵？这个价差有时很窄，有时很宽。我们发明了这个指标，发现在 50 年里，这个价差序列表现得相当稳定。但在 1999 年末到 2000 年，它扩大到了 50 多年来前所未见的水平。我们还发现，从历史上看，价差更宽的时候是价值投资的好时机。我们坚持了下来，最终赚了钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We hit spreads between cheap and expensive. This is something we invented at the time, and now a lot of people do. No one had people said short stocks on valuations go long, the cheap, short the expensive. But the very obvious question of how cheap and how expensive are they? Sometimes pretty tightly clustered, sometimes wider. Does that mean they're better or worse going forward? Was not asked before. So we invented this measure, and the spread between cheap and expensive for 50 years had looked like a well behaved series. It moved around a fair amount, but. And then I'm drawing on my hand if you see the video. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. We should mention this is an audio medium. So and then in late 99, 2000 and went to just way wider than anything ever seen for 50 plus years. We also showed that historically those were better times. You never saw that before, but when it was wider were better times for value. We stuck with it. We made money. Round trip. Life was good</p>
</details>

在那段痛苦的经历之后，如果你问我，在我的职业生涯中是否还会再见到那种情况，我可能会说“可能不会了”。但后来，它又发生了一次。甚至在新冠疫情之前，到 2019 年末，廉价股和昂贵股之间的价差已经接近了互联网泡沫时期的极端水平。然后在疫情期间，它突破了那个水平，达到了我用一个极客数学笑话所说的“第 125 百分位”。我们那次也挺过来了，虽然遭受了一些损失，但最终赚回了更多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">if you would ask me after the round trip, which was harrowing. You know, even if we love our process, you never want to start a business with poor returns, if you ask me. At the end of that, which was probably a couple years later, 2003, do you think you're ever going to see that in your career again? I think I would, I think don't want to ask, thank God, because I think I would have gotten it wrong, but but I think I would have said, oh, probably not. Hopefully. I wouldn't say definitely no one who does what any of us do for a living, I should say definitely. That's a bad word. In markets, 40% is the favored term, right? There's always a 40% chance there's all, but hey, it was the craziest thing numerically in 50 plus years. Be the question presupposes it's built in that I and people of my cohort will still be around. Yeah, right. And we'll probably be closer to in charge. So how's it going to happen again? And then it happened again. Even before Covid, by late 2019, that spread between cheap and expensive was approaching income extremes. And then it blew past it in, in in Covid, it went to what I in a geeky math joke that no one ever gets called 125th percentile. There is a 125th percentile. Okay, it's the new 100th percentile. I'm trying to convey that it went further and we survived that one too. We suffered somewhat and then we made more than all of it. Back round trip. Good.</p>
</details>

我退后一步问自己，到底发生了什么？为什么我们见证了比过去 50 年更疯狂的事情，而且它还再次发生了？这促使我写了那篇《欠有效市场假说》的论文。我确实相信，市场已经变得比过去更容易出现疯狂的时期，而且我对此有一些不错的猜测。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I step back and I asked a question, what the hell happened? Why did we see something crazier than 50 years? And then why did it happen again? And that led to this paper, the Less Efficient Market Hypothesis. I do believe that markets have shown, and I think I have some good guesses as to why, that they are more susceptible to bouts of crazy, than they used to be.</p>
</details>

### 坚守理性的痛苦

主持人：在你看来，当市场出现非理性波动时，坚守理性为什么会如此痛苦？我理解有资金成本和持有成本，但另一方面，你是一家资金雄厚的对冲基金，这想必也是投资者付钱让你做的事情。这仅仅是因为向所有人解释你的持仓为何尚未奏效所带来的情感创伤或压力吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But when you say it's painful to try to stay rational during these bouts of irrationality, why is that exactly? Because I get that there are funding costs, I get that there are carrying costs. But on the other hand, you're a big hedge fund with deep pockets. This is presumably what investors are paying you to do. Is it just the emotional trauma or stress of having to explain to everyone why you're taking the position that you have when it's not paying off yet?</p>
</details>

Cliff Asness：这占了很大一部分。我的一位联合创始人从不生气，而我总是很生气，尤其是在我们亏钱的时候。在一段糟糕的时期，他会走进我的办公室，看到我心情不好，然后问：“你为什么不高兴？”我会说：“因为人们在对我们大喊大叫，而且我们在亏钱。”他会说：“但你很确定我们最终会赢，对吧？你把自己和孩子的钱都投进去了，对吧？所以你不会做任何改变。既然我们最终会赢，只是时间问题，你为什么要在意呢？”我看着他，就像看外星人一样，然后说：“你为什么不在意？”我们最终发现，原因很明显，我比他跟客户交流的次数多得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That is a big part of it. I have a running fight with one of my co-founders who never gets upset. I'm always upset, but I'm more upset when we're losing money. This is sort of our dynamic. I have to say, I get more upset than Joe where he'll come in my office during a bad period, and I'll be upset. It'll be a bad day in a bad period. He's like, why are you upset? And I'm like, well, because people are yelling at us and I, we're losing money. And he's like, but you're pretty sure we're going to win, right? I'm like, yeah. He's like, and you have all your own money and your kid's money in this, right? So you're not doing anything different. You wouldn't do that if you weren't. I'm like, yeah. He's like, so we're going to win. It's just a question of when, why do you care? And I look at him like he's from Mars and go, why do you not care? And we finally figured out, is it kind of obvious that I talk to clients a lot more than he does?</p>
</details>

即使客户爱你，认为你过去 25 年做得很好，但如果你连续两年表现不佳，就会面临赎回。我们公司规模在三年内缩水了大约一半，那可不好玩。你必须缩小公司规模，解雇一些你喜欢的人。所以这其中确实有真实的痛苦。那段时期并没有动摇我对投资流程本身的信心，但我记得斯坦·德鲁肯米勒（Stan Druckenmiller）退休去管理自己的钱时写的一封信，他说管理客户的钱太痛苦、太令人不安了。那个人从未有过亏损的年份。我就想，如果连斯坦都受不了，那我们这些经历过痛苦时期的人呢？当你亏钱时，整个世界都认为你是个傻瓜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a lot easier to have that attitude when you're just sitting in your office. Also, we are not immune from this. You get even if people love you and think you've done well for 25 years, you have a bad two years, you get redemptions and some of those are of serious size. We fell by like half over about three years. And that's not fun. You have to shrink your firm. You have to let some people you love go. So there is some real pain that goes with that. It does not. That period did not shake my confidence in the actual investment process. I feel bad. I think I did better than our investors because I kept adding and saying, take the ball up on what I do. Not everyone can do that, and I know more than they know. Not in a weird insider sense. And just, I should be more confident in my own process than anyone else's. But it was. It is excruciating. The amount I remember, someone I admire tremendously when Stan Druckenmiller, retired, to run his own money. He's still very active in markets. I think he wrote a note that resonated with me. Because I forget the exact details, but the essence was it's too painful into upsetting to run client money. The man never had a down year. And I'm like, if Stan can take it, those of us. And we've had a lot more up years than down years and life's been good or I won't be sitting here, but we've had never three, but two plus years of of pain. And I'm like, if Stan can't take it, man, this is harder to do than it looks like the whole world thinks you're stupid when you're losing money.</p>
</details>

主持人：我从未见过有模型会考察痛苦的持续时间，而不仅仅是幅度。在现实生活中，一个幅度大 1.5 倍但只持续 6 个月的回撤，要比持续 3 年的回撤容易承受得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But most I've never seen a model that looks at pain. You just utility the negative of losing money in terms of how long you've lost money for, not just magnitude. Right. And in real life I can tell you a drawdown that is one and a half times bigger, but with six months instead of three years is ridiculously easier to, to live through.</p>
</details>

### 市场为何变得效率更低？

主持人：那么，你认为市场为什么会变得效率更低？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So let's ask the why question, okay. Why are markets becoming less efficient?</p>
</details>

Cliff Asness：好的。首先，这其中有很多推测。我无法用统计数据证明这一点，因为你需要在 35 年的职业生涯中看到 100 次泡沫才能进行统计分析。但我在文章中列出了几个原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Well, first of all, I and I say this in the piece, a lot of conjecture going on. This is an op ed. As statisticians I think a 50 page. Yeah, a 50 page page. I think academic op ed. Look, this is our first time doing this. You will be convinced I could do a 50 page, single spaced op ed, I believe you. I know you can't, it's just as a quant, as a statistician, you'd like to see 100 bubbles. Have stats on each one. This way they're all they'd rhyme, but they wouldn't be exactly the same. You tease out what's going on. If you see two in a 35 year career, you're not going to be able to prove this statistically. But I believe in my conjectures.</p>

我第二喜欢的原因是**被动投资**（Passive Investing: 一种投资策略，旨在复制某个市场指数的表现，而不是试图通过主动选股来超越市场）的兴起。我不是被动投资的憎恨者，我认为它对投资者福利是一个巨大的积极因素。但我们知道，整个世界不可能都是被动的。如果 100% 的人都不看价格，那就没人定价了。谁来决定英伟达比街角的药店更有价值？市场会变得非常奇怪。我们正处在一条曲线上，被动投资的比例比以前高得多。思考价格的人越来越少，愿意在市场变得疯狂时站在对立面的人也越来越少。这必然会加剧市场的波动。

<p class="english-text">My second favorite, is one I'm sure you've talked about. I know I've listened to you guys talk about it. The rise of Passive Investing. I am not a passive hater. They're really smart people. Mike Green's out there. The amount that guy hates passive. I don't know. The Middle East has never seen hate. Like. Like the amount my green hates passive. But but again, he's a smart. He's a smart guy. He makes interesting arguments. I'm not that guy. I think passive has been a huge positive for an investor. Welfare. I actually was lucky enough to be fairly good friends with Jack Bogle, and he was a hero of mine. We had a podcast briefly, and he did two really, and he came on it finally. I in fact, I'll tell you part of that story in a second. So the rise of I'm not a passive hater, but here's what we know. We know the whole world cannot be passive. And when I say passive, I mean in the Jack Bogle market cap weighted sense, sometimes people use passive for people like us, and they really mean rules based, like you're not. And that's not how I use the word passive. I mean, someone who owns the entire market. Yeah, we're long short and leverage. How do you get to passive on that? I don't know, but some people do. I own the entire market. We had Jack on the podcast and he absolutely agreed. You can't. Everyone can't be passive. Now, of course, being Jack Bogle, he thinks at that point the marginal investor should still move to passive, but he recognizes the obvious fact that if 100% of the people are not looking at prices, nobody's looking at prices. Who's figuring out if Nvidia is worth more or less than the corner drugstore? Right. So the market gets very weird there. We don't even understand what happens there. It's a singularity. I use a physics analogy. We don't know what happens. There are PhD students in finance, and I used to be one of these will stay up late at night in their cups talking about what happens if everyone was passive, what would it even look like? We know it's very weird, and I doubt all the weirdness happens between 99.999% passive and 100. So we're on a curve. We're a lot more passive than we used to be. Even that you're probably aware it's hard to measure exactly how how much is passive direct passive true market cap. Wait, you can measure. But what about people who take, you know, 80 basis points of tracking error? They're kind of mostly passive. Are people pegged to like custom indices? Now it's kind of funny. You guys remember The Princess Bride? Yeah, yeah. Remember mostly dead. That's probably dead. You're mostly passive. So I think fewer people thinking about prices, fewer people willing to take the other side when things get a little crazy. If one if one side really starts to get crazy, there are fewer people out there that has to exacerbate these swings.</p>
</details>

但我真正的首要原因是社交媒体和更广泛的环境。我现在听起来可能像个在草坪上对着天空咆哮的老头。但我不认为有很多人会否认，当前的环境让我们的政治变得更糟、更危险。我们生活在自己的信息茧房里，算法不断将我们推向极端。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My actual number one reason, though, you talked about the gamification. For me, it's the overall, I'm going to sound like a very old man yelling at the sky on my lawn right now, you know, get off my lawn or yelling at the sky. Some Simpsons thing. Yeah. I'm Abe in this case, but someone yells at cloud. Yeah, exactly. Thank you. Social media and the broader environment. I don't want to do politics except to say I don't think you find many people. There'll be some. But I don't think you find many people who don't agree with the idea that this environment has made our politics worse and more dangerous. We confirmation bias. We we live in our own bubbles. We have algorithms that push us further and further towards. You start out as, moderate belief, but it keeps pushing you towards extremes. And, and pretty soon you're saying stupid things like, hey, that Tucker Carlson, he's a good guy. All right, I might have revealed a little poll. Yeah, you did a bit of politics there.</p>
</details>

所有这些加在一起，让我们的政治变得更糟，尤其更容易出现摇摆和极端。市场不是套利机制，而是投票机制。价格是按美元加权的平均投票结果。如果更多的人相信一些愚蠢的事情，那么愚蠢就会获胜，价格就会偏离真实价值。我发现，很容易相信，这个让我们的政治变得有点疯狂的环境，同样也会影响市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So all of that adds up to making our politics worse, more prone, in particular to swings and extremes. Markets are not arbitrage mechanisms that sometimes misunderstood their voting mechanisms. The price is a weighted average vote where the weight is by dollars. I lucky enough to get more vote than the average person in Warren Buffett, gets a lot more votes than than I get. If we all disagree on on on on opinions. The reason is on an arbitrage mechanism. And here I'll get a little geeky. I imagine you're reasonably sure this thing is mispriced in that Gramm and Dodd sense, and you think it's massively mispriced trading enough to make it a third less mispriced. It's not very risky to you because it's not that big a trade and it's very high expected return because it's that mispriced. Now you've moved it back to a third or maybe half the next part of the trade is much riskier to you because you already have the trade on. So you're just adding more. Oh, I see it. Yeah. And it has half the gain because you've already closed it by half. So arbitrage will not take the if on net more people believe something stupid stupid is going to win. And we're going to be at least somewhat off of real prices. And I find it remarkably easy to believe that this same environment that makes our politics go a little crazy.</p>

### 从“群体智慧”到“乌合之众的疯狂”

要让市场在任何程度上有效，甚至不需要完全有效，著名的“群体智慧”理念必须对我们有很大帮助。我们都是天才的假设是行不通的，对吧？所以群体智慧告诉我们，即使平均而言大多数人不知道答案，愚蠢的答案会相互抵消，而正确的答案不会，因为它们是相同的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For markets to be efficient in any degree, not even perfectly efficient. This famous idea of the wisdom of crowds has to be helping us a lot. The hypothesis that we're all geniuses is never going to fly, right? So the wisdom of crowds and, you know. Well, says, even if on average, most people don't know the answer, the stupid answers cancel. And the right answers don't, because they're the same.</p>
</details>

我最喜欢的例子是雷吉斯·菲尔宾（Regis Philbin）和《谁想成为百万富翁？》（Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?）这个节目。你必须回答多项选择题，答错一题就出局。题目从极其简单到越来越难。你有几个“锦囊”，一个是“打电话给朋友”，但这几乎没用。另一个是“求助现场观众”。据我观察，这个方法几乎每次都奏效，即使问题很难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My favorite example of that, and this might be dating myself, is is, Regis Philbin and Who Wants to Be a millionaire? Right. Remember the show? Multiple choice show. It's frightening that you're describing that as old, but I guess it is. Yeah. Yeah, it's been off the air. Sadly, Regis has passed away. It's old. Sorry. Sorry. But you had to answer multiple choice questions, and if you miss one, you're out. They start off ridiculously easy, and they get harder and harder. You had multiple cheats. Like three cheats. One was a friend, and a friend was almost useless. You people a your friend usually wasn't much smarter than you. And b people. At least to me. I didn't watch every episode, but seemed to choose friends who knew the same stuff. They knew. Right. You really want to choose a friend who is in, like, a totally different field? I think in some countries, the friends also had a tendency to deliberately give the wrong answer because they just didn't want to see their friend actually win money. The most cynical phrase ever is nothing succeeds like a friend's failure. There we go. The other one was, eliminate two of the wrong answers. That's great. Yeah, obviously, even if you have no idea, you go from one out of 4 to 1 out of two. The other one was poll the audience. And at least to my non-exhaustive examination, I didn't. I it seemed to work pretty much every time, even if the question was hard,</p>
</details>

我想象一下，一个房间里有 100 个人，其中 10 个人知道答案，另外 90 个人在猜。这 90 个人会大致均匀地分布在四个选项上，而那 10 个人都会选 B。所以你选 B，因为它得票最多。这几乎每次都行得通。但这有一个关键的假设：观众之间必须相对独立。他们不能交谈，是静默投票。如果观众可以互相交谈，也许那 10 个人能说服另外 90 个人，但也可能不会。也许一个拥有更好推特账号的煽动者能说服所有人。如果你破坏了独立性，我想不出还有什么比社交媒体更能把“群体智慧”变成“乌合之众的疯狂”了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because I imagine you have 100 people in a room. Ten of them know the answer. The other ones are guessing the 90 distribute evenly over the the four. Maybe not perfectly evenly. It's, but roughly evenly. The ten all end on B, so you pick B because it's bigger work pretty much every time. There's a crucial assumption in that the the audience has to be relatively independent of each other. And they did that. They weren't talking. It was silent voting. If the audience all gets to talk, maybe the ten convince the 90, but maybe they don't. Maybe a demagogue with a better, Twitter feed convinces everyone, and if you ruin the independence and I think we ever come up with a better vehicle for turning a wisdom of crowds into, craziness of mobs, then social media, I'd be hard pressed to to describe it.</p>

### AI 与直觉的妥协

主持人：我们来谈谈人工智能。您最近谈到“向机器屈服”。在投资领域，“向机器屈服”到底意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to pivot a little bit and talk about AI. You've, written or you've talked recently. I forget exactly the word that was used in some of the headlines, succumbing to the rendering or surrendering to the machine, regrets and so forth. What is it? We talk, we try to talk a lot about? I still don't know exactly what it means in any context. What does it mean to surrender to the machines in the income?</p>
</details>

Cliff Asness：首先，我很确定我说的是“部分”屈服，但“部分”这个词被省略了。如果你要在你的流程中使用 AI，几乎可以肯定，你会失去一些直觉。我为此困扰了好几年，我觉得我可能因为这个让公司在 AI 方面慢了一两年。我们一直为自己能在“我们直觉上理解为什么我们认为这能赚钱”和“证据表明它确实能赚钱”之间取得平衡而自豪。当你转向 AI 时，你通常会放弃一些直觉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, first, not not every journalist has Bloomberg's high standards. But I am reasonably certain I said partially in that in the word partially got dropped. Even skipping all the details. Yeah. If you're going to use AI in your process at all, almost by definition, you are going to lose a little intuition. And the way I say that, and it bothered me for a couple of years, I think I slowed us down on AI by a year or two just by saying, you know, we've always prided ourselves on the balance of we intuitively understand why we think we this makes money and the evidence that it makes money. And when you go to AI, you're normally giving up some. Not all.</p>
</details>

举个具体的例子。我们喜欢动量，无论是价格动量还是基本面动量。多年来，**量化**（Quant: Quantitative Analyst的缩写，指采用数学模型和计算机技术进行金融市场分析和交易的专业人士）分析师一直试图通过分析财报电话会议来衡量这一点。过去的方法是建立词汇表，给单词和短语赋予数值，然后计算总分。比如“增长”是+1。但如果句子是“大规模贪污正在增长”，那模型就出错了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But let me give you a concrete example. We like good momentum. We like it in price. We like it in fundamentals. One way people, on the quant side, have tried to measure this for years is something like earnings calls, trying to decide if earnings calls are good news or bad news. And if people under react to good news, you want to buy when it's when it's good news. Is this just like how many times people say great quarter guys or are you looking at something else? It's going to sound about as silly as that. Okay, you build up tables of words and phrases with numerical values, and then you say, what's the numerical score of this? And they can be much more subtle than this. I'm going to use a real simple example. The word increasing plus one. Right. And I'm sure you see the floor. If the actual sentence was massive, embezzlement is increasing. You know our bet on that one. The amount of fraud we're seeing in our private credit deals is increasing.</p>
</details>

今天我们做的是训练机器学习模型，也就是自然语言处理，来分析公司声明。它会将每个公司声明表示为一组数字，也就是一个向量。然后我们分析 50 年的数据，找出哪些数字组合最能预测未来的回报。这似乎与我们以前做的词汇统计相关，但效果要好得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What we do today is we train ML, it's called natural language processing. It's a subfield of out of ML to analyze corporate statements. But what it does, and this is going to be the geekiest thing, I'll say. It represents every corporate statement. It looks across them and represents them as a set of numbers, what the geeks will call a vector of numbers. Then what we do is Paris to say, all right, we have 50 years of this across many firms. We have different vectors of numbers for every earnings call. What combination go long when the first number's good, short when the second number is is is high blah blah blah. What best combination forecasts that seems to be correlated to what we were doing before these word count things just considerably better. It does a better job than word counts.</p>
</details>

但失去直觉的地方在于：如果你问我或那些更懂机器学习的年轻人，那个数字向量到底意味着什么？你得到的回答通常是：“我们真的说不清楚。”我们仍然能获得一些直觉，因为这个指标的表现像一个短期动量指标，它捕捉到了我们想要的东西。但我们在其中一个环节放弃了我们过去拥有的直觉。所以，我的回答本意是更微妙的：当你转向机器学习时，必然会在直觉上有所放弃。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's where you lose the intuition. No, I skip the step. I like to do that. That's fun. Sneaky. If you ask myself, or even some of the younger people who are much more tooled up on, on, on machine learning than I am these days, what does that vector of numbers actually mean? You often get a, we we really can't tell you that. We can say it. It's summing up in a mathematical sense, the information content of that. We still get intuition because this indicator acts like a short term momentum indicator. So it's picking up what we want it to pick up. And it's also done fabulously well for us for multiple years in, in real life. But we are giving up intuition at one stage that we used to not do. So my answer was meant to be much more subtle that there are give ups and intuition. When you move to something like machine learning, they almost have to be. Or else again, what are you doing?</p>

### 多策略 vs 多管理人

主持人：另一个十年趋势是**多策略**（Multi-strat: 指一个基金内部同时运用多种不相关的投资策略以分散风险）基金的崛起。据我所知，AQR 也有一个多策略模型，但比其他地方更集中化。您能详细说明一下吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">another big multi year decade trend is the rise of the multi strats. And at AQR, as I understand it you have a multi Strat model in there but it's more centralized than some other places. Can you go into a little bit more detail. Sure.</p>
</details>

Cliff Asness：人们经常混用多策略和**多管理人**（Multi-manager: 指一个基金将资本分配给多个外部的、独立的投资管理人或团队）这两个词，但我认为它们是有区别的。多策略仅仅意味着我们应用多种策略。比如，我们将类似的理念应用于全球股票、货币、大宗商品等。我们认为这些策略相关性低，组合起来比单一策略更好，这就是分散化的力量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They get used interchangeably but I think that's the difference between multi strat and multi manager. Okay. Multi strat just means I wrote a dissertation on choosing U.S. stocks. We have applied similar things to stocks around the world. Two currencies, two commodities. Two directional bets through trend following we think of these, they are correlated but low. So we think of these as different strategies. And we think a set of our strategies, is better than a single one. Or, you know, it's just the power of diversification. So we're big believers in a particularly if you have a common philosophy. So it's not just fitting the data, it's it's fitting into an overall theme of what you believe in. We're big believers in multi strats.</p>
</details>

我们和多管理人模式的共同点在于都相信分散化。但多管理人模式，顾名思义，是我们一个团队构建这些策略，而他们是把任务外包给不同的人。坦白说，如果十或二十年前你告诉我他们的商业模式，我会非常怀疑它能否成功。他们收费很高，而且如果某个策略在很短时间内不奏效，他们就会停止。我知道很多**夏普比率**（Sharpe ratio: 衡量经风险调整后回报的指标）中等的策略长期来看很好，但短期会有糟糕表现。所以，如果有人告诉我这种模式，我会说：“你要收一大笔钱，然后解雇那些表现不佳两个季度的人？这行不通。”但显然有人证明我错了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What we share with multi manager is that belief in diversification. Multi manager is what it sounds like it is. We are one team building these we might of course have little separate teams at AQR. But will one firm building these. They are farming it out to different people. To be frank if you had told me their business model ten, 20 years ago, I would have been very cynical that it worked if you told me, a what? The total fees are going to be when you add up everything that's passed through, through and a fair amount of them and they vary in how quick they do this. If something's not working for what I would consider a very short while. Yeah, they stopped doing it. And I know there are a lot of low to medium Sharpe ratio risk adjusted return strategies that are really good long term but have bad periods. So, if someone told me that model I were to go, you're going to charge a ton and you're going to throw out people have a bad two quarters. No. And there have been people who've obviously proven me wrong.</p>
</details>

### 利率上升的影响有限

主持人：有一个现象让我有些惊讶。在 2021 年的 **SPAC**（Special Purpose Acquisition Company: 特殊目的收购公司，即“空壳公司”，上市以筹集资金用于收购另一家公司）狂热等投机时期，一种理论是零利率环境助长了这种行为。然而，现在我们利率已经从 0% 上升到 5% 左右，但这种投机狂热似乎并未消失。您对此感到惊讶吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think if you look at some crazy times in markets, whether it's, you know, 2019 when some of these measures were getting extreme or just, you know, the Spac mania of 2021, one theory that one might have offered is there. And you just like, oh, yeah, now we have you know, we haven't been in for a long time and yet some of this sort of speculative mania craze is has not gone away. How surprised are you that the move from 0% to, say, 5% or whatever didn't have more of a sapping effect on some of the behavior and speculative froth, or just sort of animal spirits in these markets,</p>
</details>

Cliff Asness：我有点惊讶。我论文里的第三个可能原因就是长期超低利率。反驳的观点是，一旦你把人们的大脑搞坏了，它们不一定会立刻修复。所以我认为这可能是一个促成因素。在 19 年和 20 年，当价差极高时，很多人说这是因为超低利率环境，成长股的现金流更多地来自未来，低利率意味着它们更值钱。我们计算了一下，这大概只解释了价值价差扩大的 2%。而且在 1999-2000 年，利率相当高。所以这并非一个统一的理论。但我确实认为它助长了一些现象，绝对放松了理性的束缚。免费的钱会做到这一点。我本以为利率回升的影响会更大，但除了 2022 年那糟糕的一年，它的影响比我想象的要小。但这不意味着它永远不会产生影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I, I am mildly surprised. Okay. I left this out, but I actually had three possible reasons in my paper. And the third one was super low interest rates for a long time for why things can get crazy. Now the counterargument is once you break people's brains, they don't necessarily repair themselves. Right? Instantly. So I think it was probably a contributory factor. Again, very hard to prove an example of I'll give you a lot of people in 19 and 20 when the spreads between cheap and expensive were here. We're saying it was a super low interest rate environment. And growth stocks have more cash flows in the future. Low interest rates means they're worth more. We did the math on that. It explained like 2% of the increasing value spread. And in 99 2000 interest rates were quite high. That's right. There was no zero 99. So it's not a unified field theory explanation. Yeah. Do I think it helped kickstart some. And again we're in the soft guesswork. But I think these are educated guesses. And I listed it as one of my three. I think it certainly kicked us off on some of these things. Certainly loosen the bounds of rationality. Absolutely. Free money. We'll we'll do that. I don't think it's not human nature that all that the takeaways are and everything comes back. Would I have thought it was a bigger effect in going back to, you know, at one point we hit about 5% on the ten year, almost 5%. What? I thought that would have mattered more. Yeah. Only in 2022 did we see one ugly year, over that. But it has mattered less than I thought. It doesn't mean it will never matter.</p>

### 播客结语：疯狂与智慧的边界

Tracy Alloway：这次对话有很多亮点，但其中之一是关于什么因素将“群体智慧”转变为“乌合之众的疯狂”。这个观点认为，只要每个人都是孤立和独立的，根据自己获得的信息做出选择，群体智慧理论就可能奏效。但当每个人都与其他所有人联系在一起，处于同一个社交网络中时，这个理论就开始瓦解。想想近年来市场的一个主导主题，就是人们蜂拥进入相同的头寸。我觉得这真的很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That was great. Literally the perfect guest. Literally the perfect guest. One. Well, there's so many things that stuck out from that conversation, but one of the things that stuck out from the conversation, it's this idea about the thing that flips from the conversation, it's this idea about the thing that flips from the conversation, it's this idea about the thing that flips the wisdom of crowds into the madness of crowds. Right? And the idea that maybe the wisdom of crowds theory works as long as everyone is sort of isolated and independent and making their own choice off of the information available to them. But it starts to fall apart when everyone is tied to everyone else, and sort of in the same social network. And, you know, if you think about one of the dominant themes in markets in recent years, it has been people herding into the same positions right? I found that to be really fascinating.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：我认为这在直觉上很有道理。它可能可以解释很多关于政治世界、市场世界的事情。我们都只是一个相互连接的地球村，就像马歇尔·麦克卢汉（Marshall McLuhan）所说的那样，我们一直在互相闲聊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that's where it makes a lot of intuitive sense. It probably can explain a lot of things about the world of politics, about the world of markets, etc. this idea that we're all just sort of one connected global village, as Marshall McLuhan put it, we're all just gossiping each other all the time. We're just constant talk, talk, talk.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway：另一个有趣的想法是，回撤的“时长”比“深度”更痛苦。我以前没怎么听人谈论过这个，但从一个管理他人资金的经理人的角度来看，这非常符合直觉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, that's a very interesting idea. I also do is interesting, the idea of, length of drawdown versus depth of drawdown and the, the former being more painful, which strikes me, is something I hadn't I hadn't really heard anyone talk about that before, but especially from the perspective of a manager of other people's money, it's a very highly intuitive that makes a lot of sense to me that, okay, like, yeah, you had a bad quarter or whatever event you're like, oh, your ideas are just out of date. It's been three years since you've made money. Maybe time to rethink some of your fundamentals assumptions.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：人们没有耐心，这是我十年来学到的一件事。还有一点是，即使是最成熟的量化模式，比如为什么廉价股长期表现优于昂贵股，关于其背后的原因仍然存在争议，尽管这感觉上更直观一些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">People are impatient. That's one thing I've learned over the course of ten years. Yeah. The other thing was the idea of markets not necessarily being an arbitrage mechanism, which I think is very counter intuitive to the way a lot of people will think about markets and this idea that like, well, sometimes you can't compress the price all the way to where it should be rationally or logically or according to EMH or whatever, because the reward just isn't necessarily there to get to that. Like final 10%. It's interesting to, to think about, the sort of link between patterns and interpretability, why something works. And in our conversation, a couple of weeks ago with Ian Dunning of Hudson River trading is like they do not put a lot of emphasis on interpretability. There's a pattern and there's some reason to establish that the pattern works. It makes money. The idea that they then have to also come up with an economic story about why it works is not so important to them. Maybe that's because it has to do with time frames. Obviously, Cliff's, trading time frame is going to be very different than a high frequency trading firm like, HRT. But it is interesting. And then it's interesting to think that even in the most established quant patterns, like why do cheap stocks outperform more expensive stocks over the long term? Right. Even there, there is dispute about why this pattern holds, even though it feels a little bit more intuitive.</p>
