### 退货商品堆积如山

**Ann Marie Ki**: 我们后来称了一下。它含有**26.8磅**塑料和**41.6磅**纸板。所以，大约有**68磅**的垃圾。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: We weighed it out later. It contained 26.8 lb of plastic and 41.6 lb of cardboard. So, it was about 68 lb of trash.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 我们可以暂停一下吗？**68磅**的垃圾。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Can we pause for a second? 68 lb of trash.

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 是的，是的。这又回到了那种压倒性的感觉，你开始觉得每件东西单独看起来都很小，然后它们就开始真正地堆积起来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: Yeah. Yeah. And that's again with the overwhelm like you just start like everything individually feels small and then it starts to literally accumulate.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 我是**Kyra Blackwell**。我是**Rosie Garren**。您正在收听**Wirecutter Show**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: I'm Kyra Blackwell. I'm Rosie Garren. And you're listening to the Wire Cutter Show.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 大家好，我是**Kyra**。现在是1月，这意味着可能是退货季。也许你在假期收到了一些不想要的东西，是时候把它们寄回去了。所以，我们最近发表了一篇非常有趣的文章，讲述了退回的商品会发生什么。我们的副主编**Ann Marie Ki**购买了一个巨大的神秘退货箱，深入研究了这些商品被退回后真正进入的**二级市场**。本期节目，**Rosie**将与她讨论退货的世界，她在神秘托盘中发现了什么，以及听众如何能更精明地购物和退货。所以，休息之后，**Rosie**将与**Ann Marie**对话。一会儿见。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Hey y'all, it's Kyra. It's January and that means it's maybe the season of returns. Maybe you got some stuff that you didn't really want over the holidays and it's time to send it on back. So, we actually recently published a really interesting article on what happens to things that are returned. Our deputy editor, Ann Marie Ki, bought a huge mystery box of returns to dig into the secondary market of what really happens to these things when you do send them back. This episode, Rosie is going to talk with her about the world of returns, what she found in this mystery palette, and how listeners can become savvier in the ways they shop and the way that they return products. So, after the break, Rosie will be with Ann Marie. See you soon.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 今天我的嘉宾是**Wirecutter**副主编**Ann Marie Ki**。我们正在讨论退货，特别是我们许多人在线购买后退回的商品会发生什么。**Ann Marie**，欢迎回来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Today my guest is wire cutter deputy editor Amirie Ki. We're talking about returns specifically about what happens to some of the things many of us send back that we've bought online. Amirie, welcome back.

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 哦，我很高兴能来到这里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: Oh, I'm so excited to be here.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 总是很高兴见到你。所以，考虑到很多人可能在这个月退回节日礼物，这是一个及时的话题。你最近发表了一篇很棒的文章，讲述了购买这个巨大的退货商品托盘的经历。我想深入探讨这个话题，但首先我想谈谈我认为可能是一个显而易见的问题，那就是**Wirecutter**在这件事中的角色。你把这篇文章发表在**Wirecutter**网站上。**Wirecutter**是一个产品推荐网站。人们访问这个网站是为了购买那些希望不会被退回但理论上可能会被退回的东西。所以，我很好奇你最初开始报道时是如何调和这一点的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Always love to see you. So, this is a timely topic given many people are likely returning holiday gifts this month. You recently published an excellent piece about buying this huge pallet of returned items. I want to jump into that, but first I want to address what I think could maybe be an elephant in the room and it's Wire Cutters role in this. You publish this on Wire Cutter site. So Wire Cutter is a product recommendation site. People visit the site looking to buy things that hopefully don't get returned but theoretically could. So, I'm curious how you reconciled that when you first embarked on this reporting.

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 嗯，我认为这真是太棒了，我有了这个故事想法，它得到了批准，人们都说：“绝对可以，去做吧。我们想知道那个产品世界发生了什么。”我认识的每个在这里工作的人都非常希望提供最好的产品推荐，以突破噪音，真正确保人们在购买商品之前了解其优缺点。我们真的不希望人们购买垃圾然后退货，因为那会令人失望。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: Well, I I I think that's the incredible thing about this, the fact that I had this story idea and it was approved and people were like, "Absolutely, go for this. We want to know what happens to that world of products." And everybody I know who works here really wants to give the best product recommendations to break through that noise and to really ensure that people understand the pros and the cons of the item before they buy it. We really don't want people buying junk and returning it because it's disappointing.

### 退货托盘与二级市场

**Rosie Garren**: 谈谈这个项目。解释一下你做了什么。最初是什么让你感兴趣的？我长期在线，无论是好是坏。而且，你知道，我看到我的信息流里有很多网红在做开箱视频，展示他们从托盘里买来的东西，现在他们中的一些人转售，一些人捐赠，一些人谁知道他们怎么处理，但总是很有趣，而且产品种类繁多。所以，我当时——

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Talk about this project. Explain what you did. What got you interested in the beginning? So, I'm chronically online for better or for worse. And uh you know, I was seeing a lot of these influencers in my feed who were unboxing haul style videos of stuff that they had bought in pallets and now some of them resell it, some of them donate it, some of them who knows what they do with it, but it was always interesting and there was always a variety of products. So, I was

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 解释一下你说的“托盘”是什么意思。它的官方名称是**Gaylord**，我们文章中没有用这个词，但它就是那种装满东西的巨大纸箱。我们的托盘大约有**6英尺高**。我第一次去看它的时候，需要一个梯子才能看到里面。你也不是不高的那种人。我的意思是，你算是平均身高。但是，是的，人们会购买这些托盘，然后打开它们。所以你可以买到很多不同的东西。有很多不同的方式可以处理这个问题。大部分这些东西在不再需要之后，无论出于什么原因，都会被推入**二级市场**。所以，如果你的商品在商店货架上没有卖出去，商店就需要腾出空间。无论是虚拟商店还是实体店，都需要在货架上腾出空间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: explain what you mean by a palette. So, the official name is a Gaylord, which we did not use in the piece, but it's the giant cardboard box that is filled with stuff. So, ours was like 6 feet tall. When I first went to look at it, I needed a stepladder to look inside of it. And you're you're you're not not tall. I mean, like you that's sign average. But yeah, people will buy these and then they will open them. And so there's a bunch of different things that you can buy. There's a bunch of different ways you can approach this. And most of this stuff is pushed into this secondary market after a good is no longer wanted for whatever reason. So if you have something that was on store shelves and didn't sell, the store needs to make room. either virtual store or real in-person brickandmortar store needs to make room on that shelf.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 所以他们通常会以极低的价格将其**清算**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: And so they will often liquidate it for pennies on the dollar.

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 也有退货商品。你买了一件东西，然后退货。它会去哪里？是重新上架，还是进入**清算市场**？还有很多东西因为各种原因从未被售出。我们说的**清算**是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: There's also returned goods. So you buy something, you return it. Where does that go? Does that get reshelved or does it go into the liquidations market? And then there's also all of this stuff that just ends up never being sold at all for whatever reason. What do we mean by liquidation?

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 大多数人可能在公司倒闭时听说过“清算大甩卖”。这确实是他们为了尽可能多地赚钱而出售所有东西，即使只是一点点。他们只是必须从中赚到一些钱。然后还有**无人认领的邮件**或**误投邮件**。这可能是你的地址写错了，公寓号码、邮政编码不对，或者你搬家了。包裹未能送达收件人有各种原因。发货人，因为寄件人，也就是寄出包裹的公司，不支付退货运费，他们就把所有这些东西捆绑在一起。所以，这些无人认领的邮件、积压库存、退货商品都可以通过这些托盘购买。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: So, most people are probably familiar with it when a company goes out of business and they're saying liquidation sale. And that's truly when they're selling off everything just to make as much money as they can out of it, even if it's just a little bit. They just have to get some money out of it. And then there's also there's unclaimed mail or misdirected mail. And so that will be something that your address is wrong, the apartment number, the zip code wasn't right, you moved. There's various reasons why a package never makes it to the recipient. And the shipper, because the person who has sent it out, the company who has sent it out doesn't pay for return shipping, they bundle it all together. So it's unclaimed mail, it's overstock, it's returned goods that you could be available for purchase through these pallets.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 这就是最终出现在托盘上的东西。好的。所以这就是你在**TikTok**上看到的。人们正在开箱所有这些类型的商品。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: That's what ends up on the P. Okay. So that's what you were seeing on let's say Tik Tok. People are are unboxing all of these types of goods.

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 是的。所以有些人可以转售他们得到的商品，你也可以买到一整托盘未开封的**Target**乐高盒子，对吧？你知道它有转售价值。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: Yes. And so some people can resell the items that they get and you could buy something like a pallet of unopened Lego boxes from Target, right? where you know there's like a resale value to it

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 或者你想要一个神秘大采购，然后你买一托盘误投的邮件。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: or you want like a mystery haul and then you buy a pallet of misdirected mail.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 那么，最初的兴趣是如何演变成这篇文章的呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: So, how did that initial interest end up turning into this piece?

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 我真正想做的是看看这个托盘里的一些商品，并真正了解被购买和未被购买商品的整体情况。所以我最初的目标是购买一个无人认领或误投邮件的托盘，因为我认为那会给我们带来最广泛的商品种类，来自最广泛的零售商。这样你就可以真正看到，然后我们就可以像**Wirecutter**一样彻底地研究它，对吧？然后我可以和我们的专家交谈，他们可以告诉我产品的好坏。我们可以，你知道，所有我们因为广泛测试这些产品而做的事情，我们对我们喜欢的选择有相当狭隘的看法，对吧？所以我想看看人们在这些选择之外购买的边缘商品，看看我们**Wirecutter**推荐的商品是否也出现在其中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: What I really wanted to do was look at some of the items in this palette and really understand the landscape of what was being purchased, what wasn't being purchased. And so I had really aimed to purchase a unclaimed or misdirected mail pallet because I thought that would give us the widest variety of goods from the widest variety of retailers. So you could really see and then we could like wire cutter the heck out of it, right? And then I could talk to our experts and like they can tell me what's good or bad about the product. We can, you know, all of the stuff that we because we extensively test these products, we have our fairly narrow view of the picks that we like, right? And so I was trying to look at the edges of what people are buying outside of that and see if any of our wire cutter picks ended up in there too.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 那么，在我们深入之前，同样重要的是，我们应该说你和你的团队在完成报道后，捐赠了托盘中所有可用的物品。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: So also important before we go further, we should say that you and your team donated everything from the pallet that you got that was usable after you finish reporting this.

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 是的，这是**Wirecutter**的政策，我们从不为自己保留任何东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: Yes, that is um wire cutters policy is that we never keep things for ourselves.

</details>

### 退货规模与商品去向

**Rosie Garren**: 好的。那么我的下一个问题是退一步，一个基础问题。我想知道每年实际有多少东西被退回。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Okay. So my next question is kind of taking a little step backward, a 101. I want to know how much stuff actually gets returned every year.

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 这因类别而异，这些都只是估计，但2025年有**15.8%**的销售额被退回。这相当于**8499亿美元**。这来自**美国零售联合会**与**Happy Returns**（一家促进退货的公司）进行的一项调查。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: So it varies by category and these are all estimates, but 15.8% of sales were returned in 2025. That's $849.9 billion. And that's according to a survey that the National Retail Federation did with Happy Returns, which is a company that facilitates returns.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 几乎**16%**的销售额被退回。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Almost 16% of sales get returned.

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 是的。如果你看服装，大约**25%**的电商服装会被退回。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: Yeah. And then if you're looking at clothing, about 25% of e-commerce apparel gets returned.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 好的。那么当人们退回在线购买的产品时，会发生什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Okay. So, when people return a product they buy online, what happens

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 退货的情况有点模糊，但总的来说，商品可能会被重新上架。它可能会出现在商店的清仓货架、折扣箱之类的东西里，或者它可能会以极低的价格被清算，并被送到**二级市场**。这就是我们得到的。现在，**亚马逊**告诉我，他们会打开并检查每一个包裹，以决定它的去向。但我打开那些包裹时，它们似乎是直接从退货人那里寄来的。所以，我不确定有多少中间环节真正发生了检查这些商品，但我的猜测是，因为他们确切知道什么被退回，他们直接将这些商品指定用于清算。所以，这就是大多数商品发生的情况，当它们进入所谓的**二级市场**时，它们正在被清算。所以，商品的原始价值可能大约是**25美元**，但它在这个托盘中出售。我支付了**742美元**。**Wirecutter**为这个托盘支付了**742美元**。我得到了报销。这个托盘装满了数百件产品。所以，每件产品，你知道，都不值多少钱。他们只是想从中赚一点点。显然，仓库也必须从中赚一些钱。所以谁知道他们为那个托盘支付了多少钱。每个人都必须从中赚一点钱。然后理论上，购买这些托盘的人会转售这些商品来赚钱。所以你想要购买一个价值高于**742美元**的托盘，这样你才能赚钱。我不会说我们做到了这一点。我可能会以旧货出售的价格，比如一美元，来出售这些商品。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: with returns? It's a little bit murky, but in general, the item could be reshelved. It could end up in a clearance rack, discount bin, something like that, in the store or it could end up being liquidated for pennies on the dollar and being sent to the secondary market. And that's what we got. Now, Amazon told me that they open and inspect every single package to decide where it goes. But I was opening those packages and it appeared to be directly from the person that returned it. So, I'm not sure how much of that middleman is actually happening to inspect these goods, but my suspicion is that because they know exactly what is being returned, they earmarked these items direct for liquidation. And so that is what happens with the majority of these goods where when they go into what is called the secondary market, they are being liquidated. So, the original value of the item could have been about $25, but it was being sold within this palette. I paid $742. Wire cutter paid $742 for this palette. I was reimbursed. Um, and that was filled with hundreds of products. So, each product was, you know, not very much. And so, that they were just trying to eek out a little bit. And obviously the warehouse had to make some money out off of that. So who knows how much they paid for that pallet. Everybody had to make a little bit of money on this. And then the theory is that someone who purchases these pallets would then resell the goods to make money on that. So you you want to buy a palette that's worth more the contents of the palette that's worth more than $742. You can make money on it. I would not say that we accomplish that. I would probably sell these items for garage sale prices like a dollar.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 你正在描述这个**二级市场**。我很好奇它有多大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: You're describing this secondary market. I'm curious how big it is.

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: **科罗拉多大学**的**Zack Rogers**自2008年以来一直在追踪这个市场。这些仍然是估计，因为没有人确切知道，他说他认为他的数字实际上是保守的。所以2008年是**2970亿美元**，到2024年，他现在估计有**8460亿美元**的商品流经这个**二级市场**。它们可以在各种地方转售。所以我们谈论的是人们在线转售，比如在实时市场、**eBay**之类的。但它们也可以在工厂直销店、典当行、跳蚤市场、一元店之类的地方出售。很多商品都流向这些地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: So, Zack Rogers, who is out of the University of Colorado, he's been tracking this since 2008. These are again estimates because nobody knows and he said that he thinks that his figures are actually conservative. So in 2008 it was $297 billion and in 2024 he now estimates $846 billion worth of goods flowing through that secondary market. And they can be resold in a variety of places. So we're talking about people online reselling it, you know, either on, you know, live marketplaces, eBay, things like that. But they can also be sold in places like factory outlets or pawn shops, flea markets, dollar stores, things like that. That's where a lot of these goods flow through.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 从**2970亿**到**8460亿**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: 297 billion to 846 billion

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 在16年里。这太不可思议了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: in 16 years. That's incredible.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 它还在不断增长。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: It's only increasing.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 那么接下来会发生什么？所有这些东西都去了哪里？这个**二级市场**是由什么构成的？人们可能熟悉那些字面上装满商品的垃圾箱商店。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: So then what happens? Where does all of this stuff go? What is constituting this secondary market? People might be familiar with these storefronts that have literally bins full of goods. Yeah.

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 所以它为人们提供了一个购买比平时更便宜商品的切入点。今年夏天我在一家垃圾箱商店，他们有一个**Wirecutter**推荐的**Simplehuman垃圾桶**，我记不清了，大概是50或60美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: And so it allows an entry point for people to purchase something less than they normally would have. I was in a bin store over the summer and they had a wire cutter pick simple human trash can for I can't remember it was like 50 or 60 bucks

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 而那些要200美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: and those are $200.

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 它们都超过100美元。它至少打了五折。全新未开封，对吧？对于消费者来说，这是一个双重机会，可以以更低的价格购买商品；对于那些真正想成为企业家和自力更生的人来说，可以转售这些商品并有可能以此谋生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: They're like over $100. It was at it was at least 50%. New inbox, right? There's a real opportunity twofold for consumers to buy something at a lower price and for people who really want to be entrepreneurs and self-starters to resell these goods and potentially make a living off of it.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 对于资源不足的社区和无法通过其他方式获得这些商品的社区来说，这可能是有益的。百分之百。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Potentially beneficial for underresourced communities and communities that don't have access to some of these goods any other way. 100%.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 那么，随着这些商品流通，在某个时候，它们会堆积成这些托盘。这些托盘存放在哪里？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: So, as these goods travel, at a certain point, they end up in these pallets. Where are these pallets held?

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 我在这件事上的向导是一位名叫**Jodie**的**Instagram**网红。她很棒。她自称“**托盘公主**”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: My guide in all of this is an Instagram influencer by Hobby. She's wonderful. She goes by Pallet Princess.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 太棒了。嗯，她在**Instagram**、**TikTok**、**YouTube**上都有账号。她白天是社工，其他时间是网红。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Love it. Um, and so she's on Instagram, Tik Tok, YouTube. And she is a social worker by day and an influencer the rest of the time.

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 只有在美国。实际上，可能不是，但是——

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: Only in America. Actually, probably not, but it

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 我喜欢它。她就是这样偶然进入这个行业的。她太棒了。她叫**Jodie**。她真的帮我理解了这个世界。她对我说：“如果你要买这个托盘，你真的应该亲自去看看。”她说：“在你购买之前，亲眼看看它真的很重要。”所以我照做了。她推荐了一个她以前合作过的人。所以，**Lisa Fischer**，我们出色的视频制作人，和我一起开了好几个小时的车。嗯，我宁愿和她一起开车，也不愿和除了你之外的任何人，**Rosie**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: I love it. And she, you know, she just sort of fell into this. And she's so wonderful. Her name is Jodie. And she was really helpful to me to understand this world. And she said to me, "If you're going to buy this palette, you should really go see it in person." She's like, "It's really important for you just to have eyes on it before you purchase it." And so that's what I did. She had recommended somebody who she'd worked with in the past. And so Lisa Fischer, who is our amazing video producer, and I drove many hours in a car together. Um, I would rather have been in a car with her than anyone else except for you, Rosie.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 嗯，我绝对会和你一起公路旅行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Um, I would totally road trip with you.

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 我们以前也进行过小型的公路旅行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: We've we've sort of mini road trips before.

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 是的。随时都可以。你知道，无论是一小时还是六小时。所以，她和我一起去了那里，你走进去，那真是一个仓库，里面一排排、一排排地堆满了这些托盘。只有一个男人在那里做着所有工作，跑来跑去，他，你知道，在收缩包装东西。他，你知道，在填写我的销售单。他就像是最勤劳的人。而且东西太多了。所以它要么按类别组织。就像我之前说的，**Target**的乐高盒子或**Walmart**的玩具。有一堆谁知道里面是什么的托盘。或者它可能是无人认领的邮件，或者我们最终购买的退货托盘。我曾对他说，我想要一个误投邮件的托盘。部分原因是我知道我想联系那些在我看来从未收到过商品的人。结果是那些退回了商品的人，因为我真的想要那些包裹上的地址标签，这样我就可以——

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: Yeah. Anytime. Anytime. you know, whether it be an hour or six. So, she and I took this road trip out there and you walk and it's truly a warehouse filled with rows and rows and rows of these pallets. And there was a singular man like doing every job in the place, running around, he's, you know, shrink wrapping things. He's, you know, he's filling out my bill of sale. He is just like the hardest working man. And it's so much stuff. And so it's organized either by category. So like I said before, the Target Lego boxes or Walmart toys. There was a bunch of teu just like who knows what was in that palette. Or it can be something like unclaimed mail or the returns palette that we ended up buying. I had said to him, I would like a misdirected mail pallet. And part of that is because I knew that I wanted to contact the people who had in my mind had never gotten their goods. It turned out who had returned these goods because I really wanted the address labels on those packages so that I could

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 涂改或任何东西。如果你买的是较小的神秘盒子，它通常会被涂改，但他们不会去处理一个巨大的托盘。作为一名记者，我可以在新闻采访中联系这些人。我确实在做这件事之前与**《纽约时报》**的法务团队确认过。这对我来说是这件工作的一部分，因为我确实想了解这个循环。所以，我们看了这个托盘。我说：“那个看起来不错。”然后我心想，“这很奇怪。所有包裹上的地址都一样。”我以为那只是一个镇的误投邮件，没有意识到那实际上是**新泽西州门罗镇**的一个退货中心，所以它们的地址标签都一样。所以，实际发生的情况是，你知道，你退回你不喜欢的衬衫，**亚马逊**给你退货标签，它直接寄到这个退货中心。我们确实有来自**Walmart**和其他零售商的东西，但大部分来自**亚马逊**。当你走进这个仓库时，它一望无际。它真的感觉像几英亩的东西。站在那个空间里感觉如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: redacted or or anything. If you buy one of the smaller mystery boxes, it's often redacted, but they're not going to go through a giant pallet. And as a journalist, I can reach out to these people in the news gathering, in the efforts of news gathering. I did clear this with the New York Times legal team before I did it. That was a piece of this for me because I did want to understand the loop of this. So, we looked in this palette. I said, "That looks good." And then I was like, "That's strange. All of the addresses on the packages are the same." I thought it was just all one town's misdirected mail, not realizing that it was actually this return center in Monroe Township, New Jersey, and that's why they all had the same address label. So, what had actually happened is somebody, you know, you go to return the shirt that you didn't like and Amazon gives you the return label and it goes directly to this return center. And we did have stuff from Walmart and other retailers, but the majority of it was from Amazon. When you walk into this warehouse, it's as far as the eye can see. It's truly, it feels like acres of stuff. How does that feel standing in that space?

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 我一开始非常兴奋，因为我喜欢东西，对吧？我是一个真正喜欢产品的人。这就是我为什么在**Wirecutter**工作的原因。然后我们在那里待了一会儿，里面很热，所有东西都堆得很高，你开始感受到这一切的压倒性。你知道，我的神经系统开始关闭。我当时想，我简直不敢相信有这么多东西。但我仍然很兴奋能看到托盘里单独有什么。所以，这是一种奇怪的组合，对吧？因为我当时想，“哦，哦。这会不会让人很沮丧？然后我想，好吧，一旦我们拿到托盘，打开它，里面有很酷的东西，那会很棒。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: I was so excited at first because I like stuff, right? Like I'm somebody who I really enjoy products. That's why I work at Wire Cutter. And then we're in there for a little longer and it's like hot in there and everything is like really tall and you just start to understand the overwhelm of all of this. You know, my nervous system started to shut down. I was like, I can't believe how much stuff this is. But I was still excited to see what was individually in the palette. So, it was this weird it was this weird mix, right? Cuz I'm like, "Ooh, ooh. Was this going to be like really depressing? And then I was like, well, once we get the palette, we open open it up and there's cool stuff in there, it's going to be great."

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 是的，结果并非如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Yeah, that's not what happened.

</details>

### 开箱与发现

**Kyra Blackwell**: 好的，休息之后，**Ann Marie**将分享她在为**Wirecutter**购买的退货托盘中发现的一些具体细节。我们将听到好的、坏的和丑陋的。此外，我们还将讨论作为消费者，我们如何才能更精明地购物，以减少总体退货量。请继续收听。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Okay, after the break, Emory is going to share some specifics of what she found in the pallet of returns that she bought for Wire Cutter. We'll hear about the good, the bad, and the ugly. Plus, we're going to talk about how we as consumers perhaps can be a bit savvier about how we shop in an effort to reduce the amount of returns in general. Stick around.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 欢迎回来。我今天的嘉宾是我的同事，**Wirecutter**的副主编**Ann Marie Ki**。休息之前，我们大致了解了人们在线购买产品并退货后会发生什么。**Ann Marie**，我非常想问你关于你为报道这个故事而购买的那个重达**450磅**、**6英尺高**的箱子。你说你购买时并不知道箱子里有什么。完全不知道。这真是个惊喜。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Welcome back. My guest today is my colleague, deputy editor here at Wire Cutter, Anmarie Ki. Before the break, I got kind of a 10,000 ft view of what happens when people return products they buy online. Amarie, I want and need to ask you about this 450 lb 6 foot tall box of stuff that you bought that Wire Cutter bought to report out this story. You said that you did not know what was in the box when you bought it. No clue. It was quite a surprise.

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 当我们在仓库里看到它时，我拿起几个包裹，心想：“哦，有点软。”但，不，我完全不知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: When we saw it in the warehouse, I picked up a couple of the packages and I was like, "Oh, it's kind of soft." But like, no, I had no idea.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 所以，你没有亲自把这个东西运到**Wirecutter**办公室。这个过程是怎样的？你选好了你想要的托盘，然后呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: So, you are not carting this thing to the wire cutter office yourself. What is this process? You picked out the pallet that you want. Then what?

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 然后**Wirecutter**的运营团队不允许我用**U-Haul**把它开到全国各地。我很高兴他们这么做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: Then the wire cutter operations team would not allow me to drive it in a U-Haul across the country. And I'm good on them.

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 是的，他们很明智。所以，我们确实找了专业的运输公司。它花了两天时间才送到我们这里。最有趣的是，我，你知道，我告诉我的丈夫我提出了这个故事，我说：“我要买一个托盘。”他问：“它会放在哪里？”我说：“我们的前廊。”实际上，它被运到了**Wirecutter**的办公室，他们用货运电梯把它运了进来。这个东西又重又大，他们把它放在我们测试楼层的中间。然后每个人都说：“你们会把它搬走吧？你们会把它搬走吧？”所以，我们四个人花了**两天时间**才把所有东西拆开。我们记录了所有东西。我们记录了有多少包裹。所以，有**430个包裹**，其中有**582件独立商品**，因为有时一个包裹里有多个商品。我们后来称了一下。它含有**26.8磅**塑料和**41.6磅**纸板。所以，大约有**68磅**的垃圾。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: Yes, they are wise. So, we did have it professionally sent. So, it took a couple days for it to get to us and it came. The funniest thing is that I, you know, I told my husband that I had pitched the story and I was like, "Going to buy a pallet." And he was like, "Where where is it going to go?" And I was like, "Our front porch." In fact, it went to um the Wire Cutters offices and they brought it in on our freight elevator. Now, this thing is heavy and huge and they plopped it in the middle of our testing floor. And then every was like, "You're gonna you're gonna move this, right? You're gonna move this." So, so it took four of us 2 days to unpack everything. And we logged everything. So, we logged how many packages. So, it was 430 packages, 582 individual items within those packages, cuz sometimes there's multiple items in a package. And we weighed it out later. It contained 26.8 lb of plastic and 41.6 lb of cardboard. So, it was about 68 lb of trash.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 我们可以暂停一下吗？**68磅**的垃圾。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Can we pause for a second? 68 lb of trash.

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 是的，是的。这又回到了那种压倒性的感觉，你开始觉得每件东西单独看起来都很小，然后它们就开始真正地堆积起来。所以我们整理了所有东西，开始挑出我们知道想要联系的人，以及那些特别有趣或引人注目的东西。因为我们不能把东西留在测试楼层的中间，所以我们不得不把它搬到一个原本是播客室但从未被用作播客室的地方。我们测试设施里的那个房间有点像精神病院。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: Yeah. Yeah. And that's again with the overwhelm like you just start like everything individually feels small and then it starts to literally accumulate. So we organized everything and we started to pick out the things that we knew we want the people we wanted to contact the stuff that was particularly interesting or stood out. And because we couldn't leave the stuff in the middle of our testing floor, we had to move it into what was built as but has never been used as a podcast room. And the one that we have in our testing facility is a little bit like an asylum. Like

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 我可以作证。我进去过。你在里面尖叫没人能听到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: I can attest to that. I've been inside. No one can hear you scream in there.

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 那是一个小房间。墙壁是软垫的，很暗。灯光不好。当你站在那里时，你能听到自己的心跳声。所以这东西确实有一种“告密的心”的感觉。我们用这些东西把它填满了。所有东西堆积起来都有点味道。所以有视觉上的压倒感，也有气味上的压倒感。整个事情就是——

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: It is a tiny room. The walls are padded and it's dark. The lighting's not great. And when you stand there, you can like hear your heartbeat in your ears. So there was like definitely a telltale heart element to this thing. And we filled it with this stuff. Everything had like a bit of a smell in in accumulation. So there was visual overwhelm. There was, you know, scent overwhelm. And it the whole thing was just

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 过剩。你就能感觉到过剩。你什么时候开始意识到你在这个托盘里处理的大部分东西都是聚酯纤维的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: excess. You could just feel the excess. When did you start to realize that the majority of what you were handling in this palette was polyester?

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 是的，我开始开箱，并让人给我拍**Instagram**视频。故事的一部分就是我会像网红一样做这件事。然后我会拿起一些东西，说：“哦，哦，这是一件长袖的、不透气的**7月4日**新奇衬衫，或者是**新奥尔良**狂欢节颜色的套装。”或者说，所有东西都是——天哪，真的有一个男士丁字裤，像一个流苏的。我在文章里称它为“**香蕉吊床**”。它就是一个**香蕉吊床**。黄色，被大胆地退回了。他很大胆。他买了两个，然后都退回了。也许不合身。我不知道。我拆了五个包裹后才想：“好吧，让我挖得更深一点，看看衣服下面有没有其他东西。”结果真的有。有**七台壁挂式空调**，显然都坏了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: Yeah, I started the unboxing and I had people shoot me for like Instagram videos. A part of the story is like I'll like do the influencer thing. And so then I would like hold something up and I'd be like, "Oh, oh, it's like a long sleeve, not breathable Fourth of July novelty shirt or oh, it's like a New Orleans like suit in in Marty Gro colors or like it was all there was literally oh my god, there was a man's thong like a fringed Like I called it a banana hammock in the piece. It was a banana hammock. Yellow that was boldly returned. It was bold two. He purchased two and returned both of them. Maybe they didn't fit. I don't know. It took five packages for me to be like, "Well, let me dig a little deeper and see if there's something underneath the clothes." And there were. There were seven wall unit air conditioners that clearly didn't work.

</details>

### 消费者认知与市场欺诈

**Rosie Garren**: 所以，听起来这从头到尾都是一场情感过山车。我很好奇你联系那些退回邮件的人的过程。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: So, it sounds to me like a roller coaster ride of emotions from start to finish. I'm wondering about the process of contacting some of the folks you were able to to see who had returned mail.

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 我们写了大约**80封信**，我可以通过几种方式联系这些人，但我们认为写信感觉最不像是诈骗。我们真的想让人们放心，我是一名记者。他们可以花点时间考虑一下。所以我给了他们几种联系我的方式。所以，我最终通过电话与几个人交谈。有些人回信给我们，有些人发短信给我。所以，我收到了各种各样的回复，但我们主要针对那些有最有趣商品的人，或者购买了多件相同商品的人，以便真正了解情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: We wrote about 80 letters and there are several ways I could have reached out to these people, but we figured a letter would feel the least scammy. We didn't we I really wanted to reassure people I'm a journalist. They could have a moment to think about it. And so I gave them several ways to contact me. So, I ended up speaking to several people over the phone. Some people wrote back on the letters and mailed it back to us and some people texted me. So, I got a variety of responses, but we really targeted the people who had the most interesting stuff or someone who bought multiples of something to really understand.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 你在信中问了他们什么问题？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: And what was your question to them in the letter?

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 你为什么买它？你为什么退货？它符合你的预期吗？你认为它会怎么样？我在信中说，我收到了你的商品。我们对每封信都进行了个性化处理，说明是哪件商品，因为有时人们会退回很多东西，对吧？所有给我回信、打电话或发短信的人都说，他们以为商品会重新上架。我们完全不知道。我们完全不知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: Why' you buy it? Why' you return it? Did it meet your expectations? and what did you think was going to happen to it? And so I said in the letter, I have your item. And we individualized the letter to say which item it was because sometimes people return many things, right? And all of the people who wrote back to me or called me or texted me said we thought that they were going to go back on the shelves. We had no idea. We had no idea.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 那么除了你和那些开箱的网红之外，还有谁在购买这些托盘呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: So besides you for this particular story and influencers who are unboxing these, who else is buying these palettes?

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 是的，任何想转售的人。所以你不一定非得在线上做。有些人有低门槛的实体店，他们会向社区提供这些商品。所以这些垃圾箱商店几乎无处不在。很多评论者或自故事发表以来给我写信的人都说：“哦，我们镇上就有一家垃圾箱商店。”就像是：“是的，就是那样。你注意到了。”另一件事是，整个世界都充满了欺诈。所以在这个世界里的任何人都有可能被骗，对吧？有很多种方式。这就是为什么**Jodie**在帮助我导航时说，你真的应该亲眼看看，因为它很模糊。这是一个非常奇怪的**售后市场**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: Yeah, anybody who wants to resell. So you don't necessarily have to do it online. So people do have low entry point brickandmortar stores where they will provide this to the community. And so these bin stores are almost everywhere. And that's something a lot of commenters or people who have written to me since the story are like, "Oh, I have a bin store in my town." It's like, "Yes, that's that's it. That's what you notice." The other thing is that this whole world is a bit rife for fraud. So anyone who is in this world is potentially getting ripped off, right? And there's lots of ways. And that's why Jodie when she was helping me navigate was like you should really see this with your own eyes because it's murky. It's a very strange aftermarket world.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 你可能会遇到哪些潜在的欺诈模式？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: What are the potential modes of fraud that you might run into?

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 所以其中一件事，欺诈发生在几个层面。有**退货欺诈**，有人会购买一件商品并保留它，然后把其他东西塞进盒子里寄回去，如果零售商不检查，它最终就会落到清算商手里。所以清算商，就是经营仓库的那个人，他对我说：“我经常遇到这样的情况，一个打印机盒子，我打开它，里面装满了石头，所以有人把打印机留下了。”所以他亏了，对吧？他试图，他说：“这上面的利润没有你想象的那么大。”所以他只是想诚实地谋生。然后这些清算商中也有一些不那么诚实。最近就发生在**Jodie**自己身上，她对事情非常了解。你知道，她买了一个托盘，顶层是好东西，然后底层，她说里面装满了垃圾。大约四分之三的东西是那种包装方块，你知道，方块类型的东西，她说：“这是有人故意做的，也许不一定是卖给她的人，而是卖给他的人，对吧？因为这里也有一个完整的链条。所以那些只想靠这个诚实谋生的人也面临风险。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: So one one of the things so there's fraud on several levels. So there's returns fraud where someone will purchase a good and keep it and then stuff something else in the box and mail it back and if the retailer isn't checking it ends up at the liquidator. So the liquidator was saying to me, the man who runs the warehouse, he was like, "It happens to me all the time where there's a printer box and then I open it and it's filled with rocks and so somebody has kept the printer." So he loses, right? He's trying, he's like, "The margins are not as big as you would expect on this." So, he's just trying to earn an honest living. And then some of these liquidators are also less honest. And it happened recently to Jodie herself, who's very on top of things. You know, she got a palette, the top layer had good stuff, and then the bottom layer, she was like it was filled with like junk. It was like three quarters of stuff that were like these like packing cube, you know, cube type things that she was like, "This was intentionally done by someone, not maybe not necessarily the man who sold it to her, but the person who sold it to him, right? Cuz there's there's also a whole chain here. So the people who are just trying to make an honest living off of this are also at risk.

</details>

### 消费者责任与未来展望

**Rosie Garren**: 我读这篇文章时有很多感受，其中一个不断出现的是作为消费者，我渴望做得更好一点。你知道，我有两个小孩，所以我们有一些东西会退货，很多时候是尺码问题，或者，你知道，冬天穿的不够暖和，无论是什么情况。但我真的想知道，是否有更明智的方式来考虑在线购物，可以减少退货的可能性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: I had a lot of feelings reading this piece and one thing that kept coming up for me is that a desire to do a little bit better as a consumer. You know, I have two little kids and so we have things that we return and a lot of times it's sizing related or, you know, it's not something for the winter that wasn't warm enough, whatever the case may be. But I I really do want to know if there are smarter ways that I can start thinking about shopping online that might reduce the chance of of return.

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 是的。我非常努力地不责怪任何个人，对吧？因为这有点像是谁的错都不是，又好像是每个人的错。这里有企业责任，也有个人责任。如果我们只考虑个人责任，现在知道了这些，就是在你实际购买东西之前停下来思考一下。这不应该阻止人们退货。如果某个东西不适合你，你就不应该强行保留它。那不是解决方案。但是阅读产品描述，阅读评论，查看一星评论而不仅仅是五星评论，这只是一个好方法，可以确保你成为一个聪明负责任的消费者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: Yeah. I tried really hard not to blame anyone individually, right? Because it's kind of nobody's fault and everybody's fault. And there's corporate responsibility here and there's individual responsibility here. And if we're thinking just about individual responsibility, knowing this now, it's pausing and taking a second before you actually purchase something. And this shouldn't stop people from returning things. Like if something doesn't work for you, then you shouldn't necessarily keep it. Like that's not the solution. But reading product descriptions, reading the reviews, looking at the one-star reviews and not just the fivestar reviews, it's just a good way to make sure that you're being a smart and responsible consumer.

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 而且你知道，我们都遇到过这样的情况，你拿到东西后发现：“啊，这不是我预期的那样。”这需要一定的尽职调查，但我也认为你之前提到了你联系并交谈的那些人，他们中的许多人，我相信我认识的大多数人，都不知道这个循环。他们只是缺乏这些知识。我从这个故事中收到的读者来信比我写过的任何故事都多。它确实让人们停下来思考。我们并不是告诉你不要在线购物。特别是，这个托盘里有很多大码服装。实体店怎么可能不备齐许多人需要的各种尺码呢？他们没有服务好人们。所以你必须在线购买，而且你经常会购买多件，因为你不确定哪一件会合身。然后它不合身，你就退货了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: And you know, it's it's happened to all of us where you get the thing and you're like, ah, this isn't this isn't what I expected it to be. It's a certain amount of due diligence, but also I think you made a point earlier about these folks you reached out to and talked to and many of whom and I'm sure most people I know don't know about this cycle. They just the the the knowledge isn't there. I have gotten more reader mail from this story than any story that I've ever written. It really did allow people to stop and to think. And we're not telling you don't shop online. And especially the other thing is that a lot of the clothing in this palette was plus-size. And how on earth brick and mortar stores are not stocking the range of sizes that many people need? They're not serving people. And so you have to buy online and you often buy multiples because you're not exactly sure which is going to fit. and then it doesn't fit and you return it.

</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 我不是想给你增加工作，也不是想给任何人剧透。这个作品没有续集的计划。如果有的话，我想知道这个报道的下一步是什么。你还有哪些问题没有得到解答？那些没有被转售的东西去了哪里？那些没有进入清算环节的东西去了哪里？所有这些东西都去了哪里？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
**Rosie Garren**: I'm not trying to create work for you and I'm not trying to drop a spoiler for anyone. There's no plans of a sequel to this piece. If there were, I want to know what the next step in this reporting is. What are the questions you still have you weren't able to get answered? What happens to the stuff that doesn't get resold? What happens to the stuff that doesn't end up in this liquidation? And where is it all going?
</details>

**Rosie Garren**: 是的，这可能是个问题。我不想就此结束。我确实想以最后一个问题结束。通常**Kyra**会问节目的最后一个问题，每一集都是如此。她通常会问人们最近买的什么东西是他们真正喜欢的。考虑到这一集的特定主题，我想知道你最近退回了什么东西，以及你为什么退回它？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rosie Garren**: Yeah, it might be the question. I don't want to end there. I do want to end on a last question. And usually Kyra asks the last question uh of the show, of every episode. She usually asks people about the last thing they bought that they really loved. Given the topic of this particular episode, I want to know what was the last thing you returned and why did you return it?

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 这是一个很好的问题，它完美地象征着这个陷阱，对吧？所以，我们当时正要度假，要坐很长时间的飞机，我看到这些小水彩画套装，我想，那在飞机上会很酷。然后我拿到它，它比网上看起来的要大，所以我把它退了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: It's such a good question and it's like perfectly emblematic of this trap, right? So, we were about to go on vacation and we had a long plane ride and I saw these little watercolor kits and I was like, that'll be really cool for the plane. And then I got it and it was bigger than it looked online and so I returned it.

</details>

**Ann Marie Ki**: 最有趣的是，当我开始开箱时，我穿着亚麻裤子，因为那是夏末，我一直在开箱像我穿的裤子。所以我当时穿着这种松紧腰的亚麻裤子，然后我心想：“哦，一条聚酯纤维的亚麻风格裤子。”哦，还有一条，各种颜色，各种长度，你能想象到的都有。有短裤，有七分裤，有九分裤，有拖地裤。我不知道。我想我走在潮流前沿。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ann Marie Ki**: The funniest thing is that as I started unboxing them, I was wearing linen pants because it was late summer and I I kept unboxing like the pants I was wearing. So I was wearing like these like elastic waist linen pants and then I'm like, "Oh, a polyester pair of linen style pants." And oh, another one in like a variety of colors and in every length imaginable. It was like shorts. It was calf length. It was ankle length. It was floor length. I don't know. I guess I'm on trend.
