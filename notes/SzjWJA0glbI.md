### 波士顿联储经济会议：全球变局下的美国经济

欢迎收听新一期**Odd Lots**播客。我是Tracy Alloway。

<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to another episode of the Odd Thoughts podcast. I'm Tracy Aloway</p>
</details>

我是Joe Weisenthal。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I'm Joe Weisenthal.</p>
</details>

Joe，我们现在在波士顿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Joe, we're in Boston.</p>
</details>

我知道。我们从未在波士顿举办过任何形式的**Odd Lots**活动，是吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I know. Uh we've never done an OddLotss thing in Boston of any sort, have we?</p>
</details>

没有。事实上，这是我第一次来波士顿。我来过几次机场，但从未真正待在城市里。我对波士顿的所有了解都来自于《我为喜剧狂》（**30 Rock**）中描绘的波士顿与纽约的竞争。所以，我基本上什么都不知道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No. Uh, this is actually my first time in Boston. I've been to the airport a few times, but I've never actually stayed in the city. And everything I know about Boston comes from the Boston, New York rivalry as depicted in 30 Rock. So, I know nothing [laughter] basically,</p>
</details>

你知道，我在高中时在佛蒙特州住了好几年。波士顿是当时的大城市，人们都渴望去波士顿。我认识很多人都在这里上大学。我喜欢这里，很高兴能来。离我家在康涅狄格州最近的大城市是马萨诸塞州的伍斯特，那是一个大城市，也是一个不错的城市。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know. And um, and I lived in Vermont for several years in high school. Boston that was the big city like people and like people aspired to go to Boston. I knew went to I knew a lot of people went to college here and stuff like that. I love it here. I'm excited to be here. You know, the big city closest to my house in Connecticut is Worcester, Massachusetts. That's the big one. That's a nice city, too.</p>
</details>

大约40分钟的路程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's about 40 minutes away. So,</p>
</details>

好的。我们来这里是为了**波士顿联储**（Boston Fed: 美国联邦储备系统下属的地区性中央银行），他们正在举办第69届经济会议，今年的主题是“全球变局下的美国经济”，这话说得太轻描淡写了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">all right. Well, the reason we are here is for the Boston Fed, which is holding their 69th economic conference, and the theme of this year's is the US economy in a changing global landscape, which is putting it mildly. I think</p>
</details>

确实是轻描淡写了。全球正在发生很多事情，各种各样。你可以列举一下，我们甚至不需要总结，但这是一个变革的时代，无论是宏观的全球大局，还是当前美国**货币政策**（Monetary Policy: 中央银行通过控制货币供应量来调节经济的手段）的近期走向，都可能是一段时间以来最模糊的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it is uh putting it mildly. There's there's a lot going on globally. All kinds of things. You could just run down the list. We don't even have to summarize it, but it is a a time of change both macro big picture globally, but also just for the near-term direction of monetary policy right now in the United States, probably as ambiguous as it's been in a while.</p>
</details>

是的，我想是这样。我们看到很多**美联储**（Fed: 美国联邦储备系统的简称）官员的讲话都反映了这一点。一方面有**鸽派**（Doves: 主张通过宽松货币政策刺激经济增长的政策制定者）谈论劳动力市场恶化，另一方面有**鹰派**（Hawks: 主张通过紧缩货币政策抑制通货膨胀的政策制定者）仍然非常担心，基本上在经历了五年的**通货膨胀**（Inflation: 货币购买力下降，物价普遍上涨的现象）之后，我们仍未回到2%的**通胀目标**（2% target: 美联储设定的年度通货膨胀率目标）。这已经有半个十年了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think so. And we're seeing that reflected in a lot of the Fed speak that's been coming out at the moment. We have doves on the one side who are talking about a deteriorating labor market and then we have hawks on the other side who are still very concerned that basically after 5 years of inflation we have still not returned to the 2% target. It's been half a decade</p>
</details>

没错，截至目前，也就是2025年11月19日录制时，根据**联邦基金期货**（Fed fund futures: 预测未来联邦基金利率的金融衍生品）的数据，12月降息的可能性约为45%，而就在几周前，这个数字还在60%以上。所以，很多事情，很多不确定性，现在基本上是五五开。我们不知道中长期会发生什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right and as of right now recording this November 19th 2025 the warp function uh looking at Fed fund futures gives about a 45% chance of a rate cut in December that was in the high 60s just a couple of weeks ago. So, a lot of things, a lot of uncertainty, more or less a coin flip right now. We don't know what's going on in the medium-term or the long term.</p>
</details>

在我们请出我们尊敬的嘉宾之前，我还要说一件事，那就是还有一个复杂因素，就是我们经历了**政府停摆**（Government shutdown: 政府因预算僵局而部分或全部停止运作）。所以，我们没有很多经济数据。等到这一集播出时，可能已经有一些经济数据了，但我们今天晚些时候还会发布**美联储会议纪要**（Fed minutes: 美联储公开市场委员会会议的详细记录）。但要强调的是，截至今天早上，一切都非常非常不确定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm going to say one more thing before we get to our very esteemed guest, but there is another complication, which is we've had the government shutdown, right? So, we haven't had a lot of the economic data. By the time this episode comes out, there might have been some of the economic data, but we also have Fed minutes that are due out later today. But to emphasize, as of this morning, everything is very, very uncertain.</p>
</details>

嗯，迷雾，这是大家都在用的词。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, the fog, that's like the term everyone's using.</p>
</details>

是的，现在波士顿港也有些迷雾。所以，到处都是迷雾。好的，言归正传，我们请来了最合适的嘉宾来谈论美国经济格局的变化及其对货币政策的意义。我们将与**波士顿联储**主席苏珊·柯林斯进行对话。苏珊，非常感谢您来到**Odd Lots**。我很高兴能来到这里，欢迎来到波士顿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, there's a little bit of fog out in the Boston Harbor right now as well. So, uh, fog, fog everywhere. Okay, so without further ado, we have the perfect guest to talk about the changing US economic landscape and what it means for monetary policy. We're going to be speaking with Boston Fed President Susan Collins. So, Susan, thank you so much for coming on All Thoughts. I am delighted to be here and welcome to Boston.</p>
</details>

非常感谢。我听说我应该吃豆子和龙虾。是这样吗？好的，我稍后会去吃。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you so much. I heard I'm supposed to eat beans and lobster. Is that right? All right, I'll do that later.</p>
</details>

好的，太棒了。那么，首先请您谈谈这次研究会议。美联储召集大家讨论这些不同主题的论文，目的是什么？为什么要这样做？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, perfect. So, tell us firstly about this research conference. What's the purpose of the Fed gathering people together to talk about, you know, you have a series of papers here all with different themes and topics. Why do this?</p>
</details>

当然，我很乐意谈谈我们的会议。我必须说，我和我们整个团队都很高兴你们能加入我们为期一天半的会议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure. happy to talk about our conference and I have to say I and our entire team are delighted that you are both going to be joining us for our day and a half conference.</p>
</details>

我们不能拒绝一个充满学术经济论文的会议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We can't we can't say no to a conference full of academic economic papers.</p>
</details>

有很多PDF要读。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Lots of PDFs to read. [laughter]</p>
</details>

嗯，它会非常充实和富有信息量。你知道，不仅仅是学者，这也是我们认为非常重要的一点，也是它特别有价值的原因之一。我们召集了各界人士，这是第69届波士顿会议，是我们的旗舰会议。我们还会举办其他会议和活动，但这个是我们的旗舰。我们当然会召集学者，也会召集来自不同机构的政策制定者，还会召集商界领袖。我们有广泛的人群，甚至有来自不同学科的人。其中一篇论文就来自一位政治学家。所以，这可以说是会议的一个标志，就是深入探讨一个主题的各个维度。这次我们选择了一个相当宏大的主题。所以，我不会说我们会涵盖所有内容，但了解全球格局变化下的美国经济，以及与风险、不确定性和碎片化相关的问题，有很多值得讨论的地方，我非常期待参与其中，学习并听取演讲。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it will be quite u meaty and informative. You know, it's not just academics and that's one of the things that I think is really important to us and and one of the things that makes it particularly valuable. So we bring together and this is the 69th Boston conference. It's our flagship. You know we do other meetings and conferences and other things but this one is our flagship and we bring together academics certainly. We bring together policy makers from different institutions. We bring together business leaders. We have a wide range of people. We actually have people from different disciplines. So one of the papers is from a political scientist as well. So, so that is is kind of a hallmark of the conference is to really do a deep dive to understand dimensions of a topic. And we picked a pretty big one this time. So, I'm not going to suggest we're going to cover the entire thing, but understanding the US economy in what is a changing global landscape related to risks and uncertainties to fragmentation. It's a lot to talk about and I'm really looking forward to being part of it, to learning and to hearing the presentations.</p>
</details>

我不想在您和其他地区联储主席之间制造任何紧张关系，但**堪萨斯城联储**（Kansas City Fed: 美国联邦储备系统下属的地区性中央银行）把他们的会议办在怀俄明州，而且是在八月，这难道不是有点作弊吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't want to like create any tension between you and the fellow regional Fed presidents, but doesn't it feel like Kansas City cheats a little bit by having their [laughter] conference in Wyoming and August, etc. Like,</p>
</details>

我们在波士顿，在十一月。

<details>

<p class="english-text">we're in Boston in November,</p>

这很棒。这里很可爱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">which is great. And it's lovely here. And it's lovely.</p>
</details>

波士顿的十一月有什么不好？但我总觉得这有点作弊，他们说：“哦，我们甚至不在我们自己的地方举办，我们要在夏天的时候在一个美丽的地方举办。”这确实有点作弊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's wrong with Boston in November? But I just I [laughter] always feel like it's kind of cheating that's like, "Oh, we're not even going to have it in our in the exact location and we're going to have it some in the middle of summer in this beautiful location." It is kind of cheating a little.</p>
</details>

嗯，你知道，杰克逊霍尔会议是一个非常特别的会议。我参与那个会议已经很长时间了，我是它的忠实支持者，我只想说，越多越好。有很多值得讨论的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, you know, the Jackson Hall conference is a very special one. I have been participating in that for a long time and I'm a huge proponent and I just say the more the marrier. You know, it's a lot to talk about.</p>
</details>

对于会议来说，这是一种积极的丰盛心态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A positive abundance mindset for conference.</p>
</details>

没错，没错。那么，我们来谈谈，我们想谈谈一些大的主题。我们想谈谈，我们来谈谈一些近期的**货币政策**等等。12月降息的可能性大幅下降，因为您和**联邦公开市场委员会**（FOMC: Federal Open Market Committee: 美联储内部负责制定货币政策的机构）的其他成员一直在谈论通胀顽固地高于目标的问题。尽管如此，似乎有很多证据表明**劳动力市场**（Labor market: 劳动力供需关系的市场）正在走弱，对吗？我们已经有一段时间没有失业率数据了，但基本上所有指标似乎都显示出显著的停滞。请您谈谈您目前对劳动力市场的看法。您是否担心我们所看到的一些疲软可能会演变成严重恶化的环境，并导致**失业率**（Unemployment rate: 失业人口占总劳动力的比例）急剧上升？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's right. That's right. So, let's talk actually, you know, we'll get into we want to talk about some of the big themes. We want to talk, let's talk a little bit of near-term monetary policy, etc. Odds of a December cut have come in dramatically because you and some of the other members of the FOMC have been talking about this concern that inflation remains stubbornly overtarget. That being said, there does seem to be a lot of evidence of labor market weakening, right? and we haven't got the unemployment rate for a while, but basically every measure seems to show a significant I don't know stall, etc. Talk to us about your read on the labor market right now. Are you concerned that some of the weakness that we've seen could snowball into seriously deteriorating environment and a sharp increase in the unemployment rate?</p>
</details>

是的。我很感谢您这样提出问题。我必须首先说，我非常关注我们**双重使命**（Dual mandate: 美联储的两大政策目标：最大化就业和价格稳定）的两个部分，这确实意味着劳动力市场，稍后我会详细说明，但也关注对高通胀的担忧以及我们对**价格稳定**（Price stability: 经济中物价水平保持相对稳定，没有剧烈波动）的承诺。所以，你知道，两者都非常重要，我正在关注它们，这正是我一直强调的。至于劳动力市场，你知道，在某些方面，这是一种不寻常的情况，对吗？我的意思是，我认为非常清楚的是，我们已经看到了劳动力市场的疲软。我们正在收集所有能找到的数据，但正如您之前指出的，我们还没有官方数据。我们明天早上会收到9月份的就业报告，我非常期待看到它。所以很难说这种疲软的程度有多大，但我确实认为这清楚地反映了劳动力供应增长的显著放缓，以及劳动力需求增长的放缓。所以到目前为止，似乎存在一种粗略的、不寻常的平衡，我们还没有看到失业率的显著变化，但这是我正在非常仔细关注的事情，我对此非常关注。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, I appreciate your framing of that. I I you know I have to start by saying I'm really focused on both parts of our mandate and that does mean the labor market say more about that in just a hot second but also concerns about the elevated inflation and what I hear about that and our commitment to price stability. So, you know, they both really matter and I'm looking at both of them that that's really what I've been emphasizing. As far as the labor market, you know, it it's kind of a an unusual situation in some ways, right? I mean what I think is pretty clear is that we have seen softening in the labor market. We are pulling together all the data that we can find but as you pointed out earlier we don't have the official data yet. We'll get a jobs report from September tomorrow morning and really eager to see that. And so it's hard to tell how much that softening has been but I do think it's clear it reflects both labor supply growth having slowed pretty notably but also labor demand growth. And so so far it seems and again we'll learn more that there's a kind of rough unusual balance there and so we haven't seen a significant unemployment change but that's something I'm watching really carefully and I'm really attuned to.</p>
</details>

但是，关于我们尚未看到失业率显著变化这一点，撇开数据不谈，因为数据会因为各种原因而嘈杂，因为那是9月份的数据，已经是很久以前了，而之后的数据又会受到政府停摆本身的影响，这就是我们没有数据的原因。所以，谁知道要多久才能有干净的数据。但即便如此，您有什么办法来预测实际的恶化吗？因为担心一旦失业和裁员真正开始像滚雪球一样，它们就会相互影响，加速增长，人们谈论潜在的**非线性**（Nonlinearity: 指系统或过程的输出与输入之间不成比例关系，小变化可能导致大影响）。您是否担心，如果等待太多数据来揭示“疲软已经到来”，您将无法及时应对恶化？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just to follow up though on we have not seen a significant unemployment change setting aside the data which is going to be noisy for all kinds of reasons because that's September which is ages ago and then the date after that will be you know affected by the government shutdown itself which is why we're weren't getting data. So, who knows how long it'll be until we have clean data. But that being said, do you have any way to like anticipate actual deterioration? Because the concern is that once the unemployment, the layoffs really start to snowball, then they start to feed on each other and they build they accelerate and people talk about nonlinearity potential. Do you are you concerned that by waiting or too much for the data to reveal oh the weakness is here that you won't have been able to get around get in front of a deterioration.</p>
</details>

展望未来非常重要，正如您所说，我也看到过过去出现过快速变化的动态情况，因此认识到这一点很重要。那么，劳动力市场方面是否存在风险？绝对存在。这是我非常关注的事情。但这并不是制定**货币政策决策**（Monetary policy decisions: 中央银行关于利率、货币供应等政策工具的决定）的唯一考量。这实际上是关于平衡这些风险，并尽最大努力去审视。你知道，你如何评估国会赋予我们的哪个目标距离更远？我认为你所谈论的劳动力市场风险的一些转变和增加，是我们今年秋天已经进行的50个基点降息的充分理由。我认为，鉴于我目前所知，这实际上已经使我们处于有利位置，当然还有很多注意事项。所以，我认为我从夏天开始就非常关注的风险平衡的转变，确实是我们已经看到的降息的理由。同时，我们现在已经非常接近**中性利率**（Neutral rate: 既不刺激也不抑制经济增长的利率水平），我们正在平衡劳动力市场方面的风险与持续的通胀风险和高位。在我看来，政策实际上只是温和的限制性。所以，鉴于我目前所看到的情况，我仍然认为这在目前是合适的。我们将深入探讨这些观点，但我有一个非常快速的流程问题。我意识到我们目前正处于不寻常的环境中，但是当就业数据（可能在明天周四公布，我们是在11月19日周三录制此节目）公布时，实际会发生什么？当您看到这个数字时，您会怎么做？您会立即进入分析模式吗？您会开始打电话给其他联储主席并讨论这意味着什么吗？您会怎么做？这是一个很好的问题。所以，你知道，我们当然有繁忙的日程和各种其他事情，有时当数据公布时，我正在开会或与其他人在一起。我非常清楚数据何时公布，我们确实有一个流程。我有一个非常强大的波士顿研究专家团队，所以，你知道，一旦数字公布，我确实会尝试快速查看它们，然后我们有时会虚拟地聚在一起，相对快速地评估我们在这些数字中看到的情况，所以我有人帮助我解读它们。通常，真正的信息在于细节。它不一定只是标题数字。事实上，标题数字可能会掩盖很多真正有趣的信息。然后我们花一些时间来解读它，我们希望将这些数据与我们已经看到的数据进行对比，对吗？因为你正在添加新信息。它不是在一个完全干净的画布上，对吗？它是额外的信息。所以我们正在做所有这些，我正在与我的团队合作，然后我当然也会与我的同事交谈，但即时分析更多是在我们每个储备银行的团队内部进行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's really important to be forward-looking and as you say I also have seen past episodes where there's been a dynamic which can move quickly and so it's important to recognize that. So are there risks on the labor market side? Absolutely. and that's something that I'm attuned to. But that's not the only consideration in terms of making monetary policy decisions. It's really about balancing those risks and looking at to the best of one's ability. You know, how do you assess which of our goals from Congress is further away? And I think that the reasons that you're talking about some of that shift in risks increase in risks in the labor market was a good reason for the easing the 50% basis point cuts that we have already done this fall. And I think that that has actually positioned us given what I know now and obviously still watching lots of caveats. And so I I think that that the shift in that balance of risks that I started being quite focused on over the summer was really a rationale for those cuts that we've already seen. At the same time, we have now moved much closer to a neutral rate and we're balancing those risks on the labor market side with continued risks related to inflation and elevation and policy is really only mildly restrictive in my view. And so I given what I'm seeing so far continue to see that as appropriate for now. We're going to get into each one of those points, but I have a very quick process question. And I realize we're in unusual circumstances at the moment, but when the jobs number hits presumably tomorrow on Thursday, again, we're, you know, we're recording this on Wednesday, November 19th, but when it comes out, what actually happens? What do you do when when you see that number? Do you, you know, immediately go into analysis mode? Do you start calling fellow Fed presidents and talking about what it means? What do you what? Hey, that's a great question. So, you know, of course, we have busy schedules and all kinds of other things going on and sometimes when the data hits, I'm in other meetings or with other groups. I am well aware of when it is due and we do have a process. I have a very strong Boston research team of experts and so you know as soon as the numbers come out I do try to take a quick look at them and then we are sometimes uh virtually and you know get together relatively quickly to assess what we're seeing in those numbers so I have help to try to unpack them. Often the real information is in the details. It's not necessarily just the headline number. In fact, that can mask a lot of what's really interesting about the information. We then take some time to unpack it and we want to contrast those data with what we had already seen, right? Because you're adding new information. It's not going onto a kind of totally clean pallet, right? It's additional information. So we are doing all of that and I'm working with my team and then I do of course talk to my colleagues as well but the immediate analysis is more within our teams in each of our reserve banks.</p>

### 联储官员密集发声与通胀预期

还有一个流程问题，但我觉得我们目前非常不寻常的环境中，一个不寻常的特点就是最近几天美联储官员发言的数量之多。我昨天开始数，不到一周就有九位。然后我们的朋友，播客的朋友Tom Barkin也发表了一篇演讲或研究报告。所以不到一周就有十位。这是怎么回事？为什么大家都有冲动在一次市场目前认为结果可能是五五开的会议之前，表明自己的立场？嗯，这更说明了需要听取各种观点。我的意思是，我认为我们联邦制体系结构的一个优势在于它确实带来了不同的观点。而且，你知道，这很有趣，因为有时有人声称存在太多的群体思维。我没有看到群体思维。我看到这一周。不，我真的没有。所以，我认为我们也有责任解释我们看到了什么，我们如何思考问题。这是我们进行沟通的一部分。所以，我实际上认为这很重要。我认为认识到观点的广度，部分原因是我们聚在一起，分享信息，是这个过程的一部分。所以，在某些时候你会听到很多演讲。这当然不是一个孤立的时期，但当经济出现转折点，可能不太明朗时，你更有可能看到我们很多人出来谈论我们所看到的情况。同时，也谈论我们的区域信息如何以不同方式为此做出贡献。我们经常在我们的区域内与不同的人交流时进行交谈。所以，我们出来活动的原因和我们正在做的事情有很多维度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And one more process question but it strikes me that one of the unusual features of our very unusual environment at the moment is just the sheer amount of Fed speakers that we've had in recent days. I started counting them up yesterday and I got nine in less than a week. And I think then our friend Tom Barkin, friend of the pod, put out a speech or a research note as well. So that brings it up to 10 in less than a week. What's going on? Why does everyone have the urge to sort of stake their ground ahead of a meeting that you know the market currently implies could be a coin flip? Well, all the more reason to hear range of views. I mean, I think one of the strengths of the structure of our federated system is it really does bring different viewpoints. And you know, it's interesting because sometimes there's a claim that there's too much group think. I don't see group think. I see this week. No, I really don't. And so, I think we have also a responsibility to explain what we're seeing, how we're thinking about things. And that's part of that communication that we do. And and so I I actually think that's important. And I think recognizing that the breadth of views is partly us coming together is sharing information and is part of that process. So there there different windows when I think you hear lots of speeches. This is certainly not an isolated time but it's when there's you know kind of less clarity perhaps when they're turning points in the economy when you're more likely to see many of us out there talking about what we're seeing. also talking about how our regional information contributes to that in different ways. And we're often talking while we're out in our regions connecting with different people. And so there's kind of multiple dimensions about why we're out and about and what we're doing.</p>
</details>

我们来谈谈通货膨胀。截至8月份的**核心个人消费支出**（Core PCE: Personal Consumption Expenditures: 衡量消费者支出中剔除波动性较大的食品和能源价格后的通胀指标），现在感觉已经是很久以前的数据了，但这是我们目前掌握的数据。所以，它达到了2.9%。这显然是偏高的，明显高于目标。你知道，如果你只是看一眼快照，看看失业率，看看通胀读数，那个2.9%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's talk about inflation. So core PCE as of the August reading, which again feels like ages ago now, but it's the data that we have. So that came in at 2.9%. So that's clearly elevated solidly above target. You know, if you just had like a snapshot, you're looking at the unemployment rate, you're looking at the inflation reading, that 2.9%.</p>
</details>

由于多年来通胀一直高于目标，这2.9%的意义有多大变化，与我们只是看一眼快照相比？您的思考中有多少是受到通胀不仅高企，而且持续了很长时间这一事实的影响？我确实认为这种高位持续时间是需要考虑的关键因素。很难给它一个特定的权重，但是

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How much does the significance of that change because it comes after years of missing the inflation target to the upside versus if we just had the snapshot? Like, how much of your thinking is sort of informed by the fact that not only has it been high, but it's been high for a really long time? I do think that the longevity of that elevation is a key factor to to figure. It's hard to you know to put a particular weight on that but</p>

你考虑的是未来的风险平衡。

是的，是的。那么，让我谈谈通胀方面的一些事情。首先，关于那个具体问题，你知道，我确实认为这有点提醒我们，经济行为并不是100%可预测的，我们许多基于人们习惯于非常低通胀时期的分析，可能对我们将看到何种反应和变化的信号有点嘈杂。所以，我确实认为，补充这些分析，当然这些分析非常有价值，我们继续关注，我们都是数据迷，你知道，这就是我们通过对话了解企业如何思考问题的方式。所以我听说企业意识到他们近年来大幅提高了价格。他们担心消费者的反应会是什么。我最近听到一些公司，至少在新英格兰地区，也就是**波士顿联储**的辖区，大部分新英格兰地区，说他们一直在提高价格，并且在某些情况下可能感到惊讶的是，消费者并没有反弹，这使得他们预期可能会继续这样做。所以，我认为收集各种信息来补充我们对行为的理解很重要，这确实是我认为合理的一些情景的因素。它们不一定是我的**基线情景**（Baseline scenario: 在经济预测中，最可能发生或被认为最合理的情景）。我关于通胀的基线情景是，我认为通胀可能会在今年剩余时间到明年初保持高位，然后随着**关税**（Tariffs: 对进口商品征收的税费）在系统中发挥作用（我认为这将需要一些时间，我很乐意更多地谈论关税，怀疑我们可能想回到这一点），

<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. But so let me say a few things on the inflation side. First related to that specific question, you know, I do think that it is a bit of a reminder that it's economic behavior that is not, you know, 100% predictable and many of our analyses that are based on periods when people were really used to very low inflation, maybe a bit noisier signals of what kind of responses and changes we're going to see. And so I do think that complementing those analyses, you know, of course those are extremely valuable and we continue to look at we're total we're all data geeks here, you know, that's that's kind of what we do with the conversations we have understanding how businesses are thinking about things. And so I hear that businesses are mindful that they have raised prices significantly over recent years. They're concerned about what consumer responses will be. I've recently been hearing a number of firms at least in the New England district, the Boston Feds district, which is most of New England, saying that that they have been passing price increases and they have been perhaps surprised in some cases that consumers are not pushing back and that's leading them to expect that they might continue to do that, you know. So I think that gathering a range of information to complement how what our understanding of behavior is important and that does factor into some of the scenarios I think are plausible. They're not necessarily my baseline. My baseline scenario on the inflation side is that inflation's likely, I think, to stay elevated through the rest of this year into early next and then as tariffs work their way through the system, which I think is going to take some time and I'm happy to talk more about tariffs. Suspect we may want to come back to that.</p>

绝对。

</details>

你知道，我认为**反通胀过程**（Disinflation process: 通货膨胀率下降但仍为正的过程）可能会缓慢而不均衡，我们之前看到的情况可能会重新启动。所以，我的基线情景在通胀方面和经济的实际方面都相对温和，但我不排除通胀大幅上升或持续性更强的情景。其中一些与行为反应有关，这些反应可能反映了长期处于高通胀环境以及对利润率的担忧，对追赶过去一些变化的担忧，以及人们如何看待物价水平，这是我们许多模型不那么关注的事情。我在外面听到很多关于物价水平的讨论，但高昂的生活成本，特别是住房，但不仅仅是托儿、食品，这是我与人们交谈时听到的头号挑战，特别是低收入和中等收入社区，但不仅仅是他们。所以，既然我们在波士顿联储的研究会议上，我需要提一下波士顿联储在去年10月发布的一篇非常好的研究论文，它研究了当前的**通胀预期**（Inflation expectations: 消费者、企业和投资者对未来通货膨胀率的预期），并将其与1970年代早期和晚期的情况进行比较。研究结果发现，围绕新冠疫情的通胀预期上升可能与实际价格没有太大关系，而是实际上超出了价格，有点**脱锚**（De-anchored: 指通胀预期不再牢固地锚定在中央银行的目标水平上，变得不稳定）了，这正是我们在1970年代后期看到的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, I think that the disinflation process perhaps slow and uneven that we had seen earlier is likely to kick in. So, so, so my baseline is a relatively benign one both on the inflation side and on the real side of the economy, but I don't rule out scenarios where there's a larger increase in inflation where there's more persistence. And some of that has to do with behavioral responses that might reflect having been in an elevated environment for a long time and concerns about profit margins, concerns about, you know, catching up to some of the past changes and how people think about price levels, which is something that many of our models are not as focused on. I hear a lot about price levels when I'm out and about, but high cost of living, housing in particular, but not only child care, food, that that is the number one challenge that I hear about when I'm talking to people, particularly low and moderate income communities, but not only. So, since we're at a research conference at the Boston Fed, I need to bring up a really good research paper that came out of the Boston Fed back in October, I think, and it was looking at inflation expectations now and comparing them to what happened in the early and late 1970s. And the finding was that the rise in inflation expectations around CO might not have had that much to do with actual prices but actually outran the prices and sort of became deankored a little bit from reality which is what we saw in the the late 1970s.</p>

人们担心，你知道，在五年高于目标的通胀之后，在物价水平上涨之后，正如您刚才所说，我们的通胀预期开始与现实脱节。这是否是您目前最担心的噩梦情景？

<details>

<p class="english-text">is the concern that people, you know, after five years of above target inflation, after price levels going up, as you just put it, that our expectations for inflation start to become unmed from reality. Is that the nightmare scenario for you at the moment?</p>
</details>

如果我看到有证据表明，特别是中长期通胀预期正在脱锚，那肯定会令人担忧。我目前没有看到这种情况，但这是我密切关注的事情。我确实认为，至少到目前为止，我的基线情景正如我所说，是偏向温和的一面，也就是说，不预期会发生这种情况。特别是，在劳动力市场疲软的情况下，我们没有看到劳动力市场的压力。但这是一个担忧吗？这是一个需要密切关注的事情吗？是的，而且，你知道，有些人比其他人更担心。那么，请您谈谈**关税**如何影响通胀预期，因为这似乎是一个难以判断的问题。价格最初会上涨，然后没有人确切知道之后会发生什么。共识似乎是，这是一种一次性转变，然后，你知道，通胀应该开始降温。但另一方面，正如您所说，我们从消费者那里听到很多关于物价水平本身的声音。

<p class="english-text">It certainly would be a concern if I were to see evidence that especially medium to longer term inflation expectations were becoming unmed. I'm not seeing that right now, but it is something I watch carefully. And I do think that at least certainly so far and my baseline as I said is on the more benign side, you know, is not expecting that that would happen. In particular, we're not seeing those labor market pressures with a softer labor market, but is it a concern? Is it something to watch carefully? It is, and you know, uh, it's something that I know some are more concerned about than others. Well, talk to us about how tariffs play into inflation expectations because this seems to be a difficult one to call. You have the initial rise in prices and then no one is quite sure what happens after that. The consensus seems to be that it's this one-off shift and then, you know, inflation should start to cool. But on the other hand, we're hearing a lot from consumers, as you say, about price levels themselves.</p>

### 关税的长期影响与企业应对策略

关于**关税**有很多话要说。所以，你知道，让我解读一下我最关心的一些事情。第一点是，当我当然说我的基线预期是关税对价格产生一次性影响时，一次性并不意味着它在一周内发生并结束。那一次性可以在几个月、一年左右的时间内实施。它只是说不预期会持续增加。一旦水平调整了，就不会有额外的影响。但这可能需要时间。所以这是第一点。我确实认为，在一个高度不确定的时期，关税确实与不确定性交织在一起，这是一个需要回头讨论的问题，以及我们刚才谈到的长期高物价。你可能确实会预期企业将成本转嫁出去的时间会延长，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, quite a bit to say about tariffs. So, you know, let me unpack a few of the things that are really top of mind for me. One is when certainly when I say that, you know, my baseline expectation would be that tariffs have a one-time impact on prices, one time doesn't mean it just happens in a week and it's done. That one time can get implemented over months, a year, something like that. It just says that it's not expected to be a continual increase. Once the level has adjusted, you don't get additional impacts. But that can happen over time. So that's one point. And I do think that in a period of high uncertainty and the tariffs are really intertwined with uncertainty, something to come back to and the long elevation of higher prices that we were just talking about. you might actually expect the time for businesses to pass things through to be elongated,</p>
</details>

对吗？然后你开始更担心人们习惯了这些持续的价格上涨，然后你就会陷入困境，对吗？所以这是一个情景，再次强调，这不是我的基线，但这是一个我认为可以考虑的情景。所以关于关税有几点。第一点是，关税确实与不确定性交织在一起，这使得，你知道，关于关税的不确定性是影响招聘决策、投资决策、企业不愿做出重大决策和项目的一些关键因素之一，而且在实证上进行区分也需要一些时间，**波士顿联储**的工作人员正在对各种维度进行大量工作，这包括考虑到许多关税正在影响进口中间产品，因此存在多个维度和层面，你必须将所有这些都考虑在内，我们还在对2018年发生的事情进行大量分析。我们能从中吸取什么教训？因为已经过去了足够的时间。事实上，我们会议上的一篇论文将从对那次经验的更全面的分析中吸取一些教训。你知道，他们已经谈到的一件事是，当时的关税增幅要小得多。它范围更窄，并且在相对较短的时间内实施。但价格水平达到峰值影响仍然需要五个月或更长时间。有理由认为这次可能需要更长时间。然后是调查数据，我们在**波士顿联储**正在进行调查数据，特别关注小企业，这是一个我们不太了解的群体，以及我谈到的对话，这有助于提供信息。最后一点，因为我认为这既具有智力上的趣味性（如果我戴上我的学术帽子），又非常重要。我们还看到了**生产力**（Productivity: 单位时间内生产出的产品或服务的数量）的显著提高，这与一些关税相互作用，可能抵消了我们看到关税对价格的影响程度，因为生产力增长实际上是一个不转嫁成本的机会，因为它能够节省成本等等。所以关税有很多复杂之处，这使得它们很难处理。我认为这将是一个我们将在未来一段时间内继续研究和学习的领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right? And and so then you start worrying more that people get used to these continual price increases and you kind of get stuck, right? So that's a scenario again, not my baseline, but is one that I think one could think about. So a few things about tariffs. One is the tariffs are really intertwined with uncertainty which makes you know it's uncertainty about the tariffs which is one of the key things that's having influence for example in terms of hiring decisions investment decisions some of the reticence that firms have to make major decisions and projects and also in terms of teasing out empirically right it's going to take some time our staff at the Boston Fed is doing quite a bit of work on a variety of dimensions and That includes analysis that takes into account that you know many of the tariffs are impacting imported intermediates and so there multiple dimensions and levels and you got to take all of that into account and we're also doing a lot of analysis on what happened in 2018. What can we learn from that? Because we've had enough time that's elapsed. And actually, one of the papers at our conference will be drawing some of the lessons from a kind of more comprehensive analysis of that experience. You know, just one thing that they've already been talking about is then was a much smaller tariff increase. It was narrower and it was implemented over a relatively short time period. It still took five months or more before the peak impact on price levels was seen. And there reasons to think it might take even longer this time. And then the survey data, and we're doing survey data at the Boston Fed, particularly focused on small businesses, which isn't a group we don't have as much line of sight into, and the conversations that I've talked about, that helps to inform things. And then just one final thing because I think is both intellectually interesting, you know, if I put my academic hat on, but also really important. We've also seen significant increases in productivity and that is interacting with some of the tariffs perhaps offsetting the extent to which we're seeing the impacts of tariffs on prices because productivity growth is actually an opportunity not to pass things through because it enables you know cost savings etc. So there's a lot of things going on with tariffs which make them hard. I think this is going to be a area we will be able to uh we will continue studying and learning about for some time to come.</p>

我喜欢您对“长期一次性”的描述，对吗？可能是一次性的，但这并不意味着价格水平从今天到明天就重置了。它可能是一个漫长的过程，形成某种新的均衡，可能需要几个月，也可能需要几年等等。不过，我对您与新英格兰企业就关税进行的对话非常感兴趣。您提到他们可能有些惊讶，他们能够将价格上涨转嫁出去的程度。公司还说了些什么关于关税对他们日常经营的运营影响？您听到了哪些实质性的事情？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I like your characterization of I guess maybe you'd call it like the long oneoff, right? There can be a one-off, but it doesn't just mean the price level resets from today to tomorrow. It could just be the sort of long process where some new equilibrium is formed, maybe months, maybe years, etc. I'm really interested though in those conversations that you have with New England businesses about tariffs. You mentioned perhaps some of their surprise that they were able to pass on price increases to the degree that they have. What else are companies saying about sort of the operational effects, the day-to-day effects of how they're managing their business in light of tariffs? What substantive things do you hear about?</p>
</details>

所以，有很多不同的事情。我所进行的许多关税对话实际上都与应对不确定性交织在一起。所以，我听到的一件事是，根据非常不同的关税水平进行调整和做出调整是具有挑战性的。但是，如果我们确切地知道它是什么，并且它会保持不变，那么调整起来会比来回变动和不确定性容易得多。这会造成一些犹豫。它也造成或增加了（因为我认为这已经存在了）我称之为几乎是**效率思维**（Efficiency mindset: 优先考虑通过优化流程、技术或资源利用来降低成本和提高产出的思考方式），即企业不愿招聘，因为他们不确定事情会如何发展，而关税是一种成本增加，如果你能通过效率来抵消这种增加，那是一种前进的方式，几乎是一种“无悔”的投资，因为无论关税发生什么，如果你找到了效率改进，那将是一个有益的背景。所以这与**人工智能**（AI: Artificial Intelligence: 模拟人类智能的计算机系统）有关，但肯定不仅仅是人工智能，它还包括生产流程、自动化，它还解决了由于熟练劳动力短缺而难以招聘的一些长期存在的问题。所以，我自2022年上任以来一直听到的一些事情仍在继续，然后又增加了一系列额外的事情。所以对于许多企业，特别是大型企业，我实际上听到了一些谨慎的乐观情绪，因为他们展望未来。这在一定程度上取决于行业。存在一些差异，也取决于一些全球联系以及其他一些竞争效应，但我听到了很多这样的情况，并且在某些地方的一些小公司中，压力和担忧更多一些，所以这也是我们最近开始通过季度小企业调查来增加信息的原因之一。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So, a number of different number of different things. A lot of the tariff conversations that I've had really are intertwined with navigating uncertainty. So, one of the things that, you know, I've heard is it's challenging to navigate and make adjustments based on a very different tariff level. But if we knew exactly what it was and it was going to stay there, that would be much easier to adjust to than back and forth and uncertainty. And that creates some hesitancy. It also creates or adds to because I think this was already there what I'm calling almost an efficiency mindset where firms are reticent to hire because they're not sure how things are evolving and tariffs are you know a cost increase to the extent that you can offset that through efficiencies that is one way forward that is almost kind of like a no regrets type of investment because whatever happens with the tariffs if you found efficiency improvements that will have been a helpful kind of context. So that links up with AI but it's certainly not only AI it's production processes it's automation it's addressing some longerstanding areas where it was difficult to hire because of skilled shortages. So a number of things that I have been hearing since I started in the role in 2022 continue and then there's this additional set of things that are added on. So for many businesses especially the larger ones I actually hear some kind of cautious optimism as they look out ahead. It depends somewhat on the sector. there somewhat some differences and it depends what some of the global linkages are and some of those other competitive effects but I've heard quite a bit of that and a bit more stress and concern among some of the uh smaller firms in some places and so that's part of why we're trying to add to the information there through a quarterly small business survey that we started doing recently.</p>
</details>

我犹豫是否要问太多理论性问题，但我认为这最近已经变得不那么理论性了，但最高法院很有可能会废除这些关税中的很大一部分。作为政策制定者，您将如何处理这种通胀一次性转变的近似原因突然受到质疑的情况？除此之外，您在边缘还有更多不确定性，关于人们是否会获得关税奖金，以及如果关税被最高法院废除，企业是否会收到退款。这似乎是一个非常复杂的场景，需要思考，更不用说为此做计划了。正如您刚才指出的，这个领域存在相当大的不确定性，而且，你知道，我不知道事情会如何发展，对于其中一些事情，我认为认识到不确定性并根据我们已知的事情进行评估，在某种程度上进行情景规划，但其中一些真的很难弄清楚事情会如何发展。过早地预测可能没有帮助。所以，你知道，再次回到您的观点，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I hesitate to ask too many theoreticals here, but I think this has actually become less of a theoretical recently, but the there is a good chance that the Supreme Court strikes down a big chunk of these tariffs. How would you as a policy maker actually deal with, you know, the approximate cause of this one-time shift of inflation suddenly being put in doubt? And then on top of that, you also have more uncertainties on the margin about whether or not people might get tariff bonuses and then whether or not businesses would receive refund checks if the tariffs were, you know, struck down by the Supreme Court. That seems like a very complicated scenario to be thinking about and much less planning for there is considerable uncertainty in this space as you just pointed out and you know I don't know how things will unfold and for some of those things I think recognizing the uncertainty and making assessments based on the things that we know to some extent looking at scenario planning but some of the really hard to figure it out how things would unfold. It may not be helpful to get too far ahead of that. So, you know, again to your point,</p>

### 劳动力市场、AI与住房政策

快速提问。即使在招聘放缓等等以及过去几年劳动力市场的巨大变化下。您是否仍然经常听到熟练劳动力短缺的问题？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Quick question. Even with this the slowdown in hiring etc. and the sort of big changes to the labor market in the last few years. Do you still regularly hear about skilled labor shortages?</p>
</details>

在某些行业和地区我确实听到过，让我举几个例子。例如，对于新英格兰的部分地区，新英格兰实际上比美国其他地区老龄化更快。这是我们的一个显著特点。我们，你知道，相当成熟，我们有很多美妙的优势。所以有些地方几乎存在劳动力短缺。在一些熟练领域，企业继续告诉我，也许情况有所好转，但招聘某些类型的行业工人仍然具有挑战性。所以，我一直非常受启发的是创新合作。例如，在康涅狄格州东部，与熟练制造业相关，将私营部门与高等教育和地方公共部门的支持结合起来，将人们聚集在一起解决这些问题，并确定人才输送渠道，你知道，科德角社区学院也有一个。他们正在培训航空技术维修。他们有一个新的，相对较新的项目，我相信很快将成为全国最大的项目，这是一个全国范围内存在熟练劳动力短缺的领域。所以，在某些领域存在短缺，也有旨在解决这些问题的举措，我发现这很鼓舞人心。所以我当然理解您的观点，即美联储必须或应该非常注意通胀仍然高于目标的事实，并且存在一些情景，即使它们不是您的基线情景，也会成为一个真正的问题。话虽如此，你知道，在什么情况下，即使通胀高于目标，也值得降息？劳动力市场疲软必须达到什么程度才能说，你知道，我们还没有回到2%，但我们在劳动力市场方面存在一个真正的问题，这成为了优先事项。所以很明显，正如我之前提到的，确实需要平衡这些风险。所以我确实会考虑我们每个**双重使命**目标距离目标有多远。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I do in some sectors and some areas and and let me give you a couple of examples. So for, you know, parts of New England, New England is actually aging faster than the rest of the country. That's one of our distinguishing features. We're, you know, quite seasoned and we we have many wonderful advantages. And so there are places where there is more of almost a labor shortage. there's some skilled areas where firms continue to tell me maybe it's gotten a bit easier, but it's still challenging to hire for certain kinds of of trades. And so, one of the things that I've been really inspired to see are innovative collaborations. So for example in eastern Connecticut related to skilled manufacturing pulling private sector together with you know higher education and support across local public sector bringing people together to solve those problems and to identify pipelines and you know the Cape Cod Community College has one too. They're training aviation technology maintenance. they have a new uh relatively new program which will soon I believe be the biggest in the country and that is an area where there is a skilled shortage nationally. So there are shortages in some areas and there also initiatives to try to address them which I find inspiring. So I certainly take your point obviously that you have to the Fed has to be or ought to be very mindful of the fact that inflation is still above target and that there are scenarios even if they're not your base case we're going to become a real problem. That being said you know at what point is it worth cutting even if inflation is above target? Where is the labor market weakness have to get to say you know what we're not back to 2% but we have a real problem on the labor market side that that becomes the priority. So there clearly, as I mentioned before, there clearly does need to be a balance of those risks. And so I do think about how far each of our dualmandated goals is from the target.</p>
</details>

著名的失业率没有像我们通胀方面那样有一个漂亮的2%的数字。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And so if the famous unemployment doesn't have one like we have with we have that nice 2% number on the inflation side.</p>
</details>

是的。所以，这确实比通胀更不具体。绝对。但我确实认为我们对充分就业是什么样子有一个概念。你知道，这是我们在最近完成的框架审查中讨论过的一部分，它将充分就业描述为在价格稳定下可以长期维持的最大就业水平。我认为这是一种有益的思考方式，因为它也会随着时间的推移而演变。它不仅仅是一个数字。我认为这样思考是合适的。所以，如果我们看到证据，如果我看到劳动力市场明显恶化的证据，我会非常认真地对待，这当然可以证明近期额外的宽松政策是合理的。所以，你知道，我谨慎地根据我目前所看到的情况来限定我的声明，即它是基于风险平衡的。但我认为重要的是不要忘记与通胀方面相关的真正担忧，以及密切关注劳动力市场方面正在发生的事情。你知道，随着劳动力需求大幅放缓，招聘大幅减少，尽管劳动力供应增长也明显放缓，但需求有可能远低于供应增长，我们可能会开始看到更显著的失业率上升。所以需要非常仔细地关注，我们明天将收到的9月份数据将有所帮助。你知道，首次申请失业金人数、其他信息，我们许多人正在收集和查看的信息也很有帮助，但是，你知道，那仍然是9月份的数据，所以还有更多信息即将到来。所以，我正在思考劳动力市场的一件事，你知道，我们已经从许多美联储政策制定者那里听到了供应论点，你知道，盈亏平衡率论点，但是如果劳动力市场的供应是这里的问题，因为移民或其他原因，并且是关于供应而不是需求恶化，我们难道不应该预期在其他统计数据中看到一些紧张情况，比如工资收入，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So that's that is a you know a little bit less specifically concrete than inflation. Absolutely. But I do think that we have a sense of what full employment looks like. And you know this something we talked about as part of the framework review that was completed recently that you know describes that as the maximum employment that you can sustain over time that's consistent with price stability. And I think that's a helpful way of thinking about it because it also evolves over time. It's not just one number. And I think it's appropriate to think about it that way. So if we were seeing evidence, if I were seeing evidence that the labor market were notably deteriorating, I would take that very seriously and that certainly could justify, you know, near-term additional easing. And so I, you know, careful to kind of qualify my statements based on what I'm seeing at the moment that it is based on balancing risks. But I think it's important not to forget about the real concerns related to the inflation side as well as staying very attentive to what's happening on the labor market side. And you know with much slower labor demand, much lower hiring, even though the labor supply growth is clearly much lower as well, there is a risk that the demand would fall well below the supply growth and we would start to see more notable unemployment increases. So something to watch very carefully and the data from September that we'll get tomorrow is helpful. you know, the initial claims unemployment, the other information that many of us are gathering and looking at is helpful as well, but you know, that's still from September and so there's more information to come. So, one thing I'm wondering about the labor market and you know, we've heard the supply argument, um, you know, the break even rate argument from a number of Fed policy makers at this point, but if supply in the labor market is the issue here because of immigration or whatever, and it's about that supply rather than a deterioration in demand, shouldn't we have expected to see some tightness showing up in other statistics like wages earned,</p>

我认为这种情况已经持续了一段时间。我认为，如果说有什么变化的话，我最近看到的数据（但同样，你知道，我没有最新的信息）有所下降。它高于疫情前。同时，考虑到我们看到的**生产力**，在我看来，这与价格稳定是一致的。所以，我一直没有那么担心劳动力市场，这说明需求和供应都下降了，这就是我之前谈到的那种不寻常的平衡。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that's been true for a while. I think if anything the more recent data I've seen but again you know don't have the most recent information you know has come down a bit. It's been higher than it was pre- pandemic. At the same time, given the productivity that we'd seen, that is consistent in my view with, you know, with with price stability. So, I have not been as concerned about the labor market and that speaks to both demand and supply having come down, which is this kind of unusual balance that I was talking about before.</p>

是的，你知道，如果我回想六个月前，这还是我与来自不同行业的商业领袖群体会面时，对话中一个有趣的部分。现在，它已经占据了对话的很大一部分，通常围坐在一起的人中，没有一个人不告诉我他们是如何思考它、正在做什么、发现了什么。它无处不在。这是真的，你知道。所以，不久前我参观了佛蒙特州北部的一家木材厂，了解到他们是如何使用**人工智能**来分类木板的，部分原因是因为他们在该国那个地区很难招聘到熟练劳动力。但后来他们告诉我他们发现的所有其他好处，以及他们如何教它做更多的事情。我没想到去一家木材厂，我们会花相当多的时间谈论人工智能。所以它要广泛得多。我听说人工智能确实在支持工人，使他们能够做更多的事情，更专注，在报告和各种后台工作中节省时间。有些人告诉我，他们实际上预计它将使他们能够增长，因为在某些方面节省了成本，他们对此感到兴奋。然后另一些人告诉我，它可能使他们能够裁员。我认为现在还处于早期阶段，有很多很多不同的维度，而且正如您所说，还有很多实验。所以我听到所有这些。这真的很有趣，我认为现在判断它将如何发展还为时过早。

<p class="english-text">Yeah, you know, so if I think back even six months, it was a a kind of interesting piece of the conversation that I would have when I'm meeting with a group of different business leaders from different sectors. It's now a significant share of the conversation and typically there's not one of the people around the table who isn't telling me how they're thinking about it, what they're doing, what they're finding. It's out there. It's everywhere. And that's true, you know. So, I was not too long ago visiting a lumber mill in northern Vermont and learned about how they have been using AI in order to sort planks in part because they were having trouble hiring that skilled labor in that part of the country. But then they told me about all of the other benefits they were finding and ways that they were teaching it to do additional things. I hadn't expected going to a lumber mill that we were going to spend quite a bit of time talking about AI. So it's much broader. I am hearing that there are some ways that the AI is really supporting workers and enabling them to do more and be more focused, saving time in terms of reporting and a variety of different back office kinds of things. I have some people telling me that they actually expected it'll enable them to grow because of some of the savings in ways that they're excited about. and then others that are telling me that it may be enabling them to downsize. I think it's still early days and there many many different dimensions and there's still a lot of experimentation to your point. So I'm hearing all of it. It's really interesting and I think it's much too early to tell how it's all going to play out.</p>

为什么不呢？但是当您想到**人工智能**时，它是否让您想到美联储使命中的失业方面以及美联储的政策能力？我的意思是，你知道，传统上，如果你想提振就业，你就会降低利率，这应该会鼓励企业投资新资本，历史上，很多这种资本都意味着额外的就业机会，尽管我们可以讨论自动化等等。但是当涉及到人工智能时，你降低利率，人们投资人工智能，我认为担忧是这意味着更少的就业机会。现在，作为美联储的一员，您的主要工具是基准利率，您如何看待这个问题？这有很多方面，也有很多思考正在进行，对吗？所以，让我说几点。我认为，尽管我们是温和限制性的，但我们看到广泛的企业和行业在人工智能方面进行了大量投资。这是企业显然正在投入的事情之一。你知道，我确实将人工智能视为一种**通用技术**（General purpose technology: 指对经济和社会产生广泛而深远影响的技术，如电力、互联网），就像互联网或电力一样。如果你回顾历史，当这些技术被采用时，也有人讨论说，这些新技术的引入将真正消除大量的就业机会。还有其他人点燃煤气灯，他们将失业，

<p class="english-text">Why not? But when you think about AI, does it make you think about the unemployment side of the mandate and you know the policym capacity at the Fed? And what I mean by that is, you know, traditionally you lower interest rates if you want to try to boost employment and that's supposed to encourage businesses to invest in new capital and historically a lot of that capital has meant additional jobs, although we can debate automation and all of that. But when it comes to AI, you lower interest rates, people invest in AI, and I think the concern is that that means fewer jobs. Now, how do you think about that as someone at the Fed whose primary tool is the benchmark rate? Lots of pieces to that and a lot of thinking going on, right? So, let me just let me say a couple of things. So, I do think that even though you know we're mildly restrictive, we are seeing considerable investments across a wide range of firms and sectors in AI. That is one of the things that firms are clearly leaning into. And you know I do think of AI as a general purpose technology which is like the internet or like electricity. And if you go back in history in those when those were being adopted there was also discussion that introduction of those new technologies was going to you know just really eliminate a huge number of jobs. and what other people lighting gas lamps who are going to be unemployed electricity</p>
</details>

电力和天然气，你知道，以及其他事物都得到了发展，其中一些我们还没有想象到，所以我确实认为历史很重要，同时，这种**通用技术**似乎可能发展得更快，这可能会带来更多的转型挑战，再次强调，现在思考这可能如何发展还为时过早，但我确实预计会有新的机会和新的，你知道，我的意思是当女性进入劳动力市场时，人们认为这意味着男性将没有工作，因此，你知道，显然我们看到的是就业机会、活力和美国经济在许多不同方面都显著增加，但现在还处于早期阶段，重要的是要发挥作用，我要说的另一件事是，美联储关注并深切关心很多事情，因为它们影响经济状况。它们影响就业。它们影响通货膨胀。我们需要理解它们。我们需要关注它们，但它们不是我们的政策工具能够直接影响的事情。所以，我认为我们需要认识并区分这些事情。你知道，放松一点的一个原因，你知道，它可以促进一个环境，使劳动力更容易过渡到不同的领域和地方。所以，我认为有很多考虑因素，但同样，这将在一段时间内发展。

<details>

<p class="english-text">and gas you know and other things were developed and some of them we don't we're not imagining yet so I do think that that history is important at the same time it does seem potentially like this general purpose technology might unfold more quickly and that could create more transition challenges again it's really early days in terms of thinking about how that may play out but I am expecting there'll be new opportunities and new you know I mean when women join the labor market the view was that will mean there were no jobs for men and therefore you know and obviously what we've seen is a significant increase in job opportunities vibrancy and the US economy is a vibrant dynamic economy in a number of different ways but early days important to play out the other thing I will say is there are a lot of things the Fed focuses on and cares deeply about because they impact economic conditions. They impact employment. They impact inflation. We need to understand them. We need to follow them, but they aren't the direct thing that our policy tools are able to influence. And so, I think we need to kind of recognize and separate those things. You know, one reason to have, you know, eased a bit is it could facilitate an environment where it's easier for labor to make transitions to to different kind of areas and places. So I think there are lots of considerations there but again this one's going to unfold over some period of time.</p>

你知道，您提到的一件事是人们不仅关心通胀率，他们还关心整体的负担能力。所以物价水平已经大幅上涨，而人们消费篮子中有一个部分在几年内大幅上涨，那就是住房成本等等。这是一个不时出现的问题，即利率政策在住房方面可能会产生多重影响，因为较高的利率可能会使抵押贷款成本更高，需求可能会有所下降，也许这有助于平衡价格。另一方面，这也会抑制开发，而开发商对利率非常敏感。我们已经看到很多**新屋开工**（Housing starts: 衡量新住宅建设活动的经济指标）数据下降，住房活动等等。您如何看待如何正确平衡这一点，特别是考虑到居民对物价水平等的突出关注。您如何看待住房供应的最佳政策？

<p class="english-text">You know one of the things you mentioned is people don't just care about the rate of inflation they care about affordability overall. So the price level which has gone up very significantly and one segment of people's consumption basket that's gone up a lot in several years the cost of housing and so forth. And this is something that comes up from time to time, which is that rate policy when it comes to housing can sort of cut in multiple directions because higher interest rates might, you know, make mortgages more costly and you get a depression a little bit in demand and maybe that helps balance prices. On the other hand, that could also curtail development and developers are very attuned to the interest rates. We have seen a lot of measures of housing starts come down, housing activity, etc. How do you think about getting that balance right and this particularly given the salience of residents when it comes to the price level etc. How do you think about optimal policy for housing supply?</p>

是的，住房因各种原因非常重要。它是我听到的最常见的担忧之一，不仅仅是针对中低收入人群，对吗？我的意思是，可及性和可用性比这广泛得多。所以，你知道，它对经济活力、个人家庭都很重要，它可能成为参与经济的障碍，对吗？所以我从这个角度担心这一点，我们现在面临着实际的负担能力挑战，有很多统计数据表明长期以来住房短缺和负担能力挑战，需要许多不同的群体共同努力才能真正解决这些问题。所以，你知道，短期内较高的利率确实会产生影响。同时，当然，通常相关的短期和长期利率受到许多不同因素的影响。我想说，重要的是有两点。第一点是，恢复和维持价格稳定和最大就业创造了一个真正有利于解决我们的住房挑战并长期维持这种环境和基础设施的环境。所以，你知道，维持这种更广泛的环境，我认为是国会赋予我们的职责，它将创造这种环境。另一件事是，你知道，作为无党派、值得信赖的数据极客资源，美联储可以帮助将不同的群体聚集在一起分享信息，帮助成为召集者。**波士顿联储**今年夏天与**哈佛住房研究中心**（Harvard Center on Housing Studies: 致力于住房政策和研究的学术机构）共同举办了一次会议，发布了他们的年度报告，我们有来自八个不同储备银行的同事。我们所有人都参与并有兴趣在我们的社区中工作，以支持解决住房挑战。所以，这是我们最关心的问题，有些事情我们可以影响，有些事情我们当然不能。我们出于显而易见的原因谈论了很多经济，但我知道我们在波士顿，您是**波士顿联储**主席，如果说我对这个城市有什么了解的话，那就是它是一个金融中心。这里有很多金融公司，特别是在买方。我能很快问一下，您对市场关注了多少，并反思了那里发生的事情？因为当然，我们有很多关于**人工智能泡沫**的讨论，尽管最近几天和几周，这个泡沫可能已经泄气了，但我们也在融资市场看到了一些紧张。你知道，我们看到**回购协议**（Repo: Repurchase Agreement: 金融机构之间通过出售证券并在未来回购来借贷短期资金的协议）等方面出现了一些轻微的收紧。您是否也在关注这些以及更广泛经济中发生的事情？

<p class="english-text">Yeah, housing is really important for a variety of reasons. It is one of the most frequent concerns that I hear not just for lower moderate income, right? I mean the accessibility availability is much broader than that. So you know it matters in terms of economic vibrancy individuals households it matters in terms of it can be a barrier to participating in the economy right so I worry about that from that standpoint we got in the context that we're in now with real challenges with affordability and there are lots of statistics that demonstrate the lack of housing and affordability challenges over a long period of time and it's going to take a number of different groups working together to be able to really address them. So, you know, it is true that in the short run higher interest rates do have an impact. At the same time, of course, the shorter the longer term rates that are often relevant there are influenced by a number of different factors. I would say importantly guess two just quick things. One is that restoring and maintaining price stability and maximum employment creates an environment that's really conducive to addressing our housing challenges and sustaining that environment, that infrastructure over time. And so it's, you know, it's maintaining that broader environment that I think is what Congress has charged us to do and that will create that environment. The other thing is that, you know, as a nonpartisan, trusted data geekish resource, the Fed can help to be bring different groups together to share information to help be a convenor. The Boston Fed hosted a conference this summer with the Harvard uh center on housing studies that put out their annual report and we had our colleagues from eight different reserve banks. All of us are engaged and interested in working in our communities to support addressing the housing challenges. So, it's top of mind and there are things that we can influence and then there's some things that of course we cannot. We've been talking a lot about the economy for obvious reasons, but I am aware that we are in Boston and you are the Boston Fed president and if there's one thing I do know about the city is that it is a financial center. There are a lot of financial firms, especially on the buy side over here. Can I ask very quickly, how much have you been watching the markets and reflecting on what's been going on there? Because of course, we've had lots of talk about an AI bubble, although maybe some of the air has been kicked out of that bubble's tires in recent days and weeks. But we also have some strains in the funding markets. You know, we've seen some curles to put it mildly in repo and things like that. Are you watching those as well as what's happening with the broader economy?</p>

绝对。所以，你知道，我们的团队也非常仔细地关注金融市场的发展，你知道，我们确实看到了一些波动，当然，与年初相比，市场仍然上涨，但**利差**（Spreads: 两种利率、收益率或价格之间的差异）仍然相对较低，所以有很多事情需要关注和了解，因为我们思考我们更广泛的责任和职责。

<p class="english-text">Absolutely. So you know our teams are also very carefully watching developments in financial markets and you know we are seeing some more volatility certainly you know compared to the beginning of the year markets are still up but spreads are still relatively low and so there are a number of things to be focused on and to be aware of as we think about our broader responsibilities and charge.</p>

Joe，我真的很喜欢这次对话。我认为现在是与美联储任何人交谈的非常有趣的时刻。我想我仍在努力弄清楚目前政策制定者之间的分歧，是关于他们如何看待当前经济状况，因为实际上似乎有很多共识，比如劳动力市场正在恶化，而且通胀，你知道，你不能否认它高于目标，还是关于他们想强调使命的哪一方面，或者使命的哪一方面有可能失控，基本上是指数级上升或下降的通胀率或失业率。是的，我认为这很好地总结了为什么存在如此多的争论和分歧，因为再次看看，即使撇开官方数据来源的数据中断不谈，也存在困惑，然后你再加上数据中断，然后是关于

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Joe, I really enjoyed that conversation. I think it is such an interesting time to be talking with anyone on the Fed. I guess I'm still trying to wrap my head around whether the division among policy makers currently whether it's about how they see the state of the economy right now because actually there does seem to be a lot of consensus like the labor market is deteriorating and inflation you know you can't deny that it is above target or whether it's about which side of the mandate they want to emphasize or whether it's about which side of the mandate has the potential to get out of hand basically and you know either rise or decrease exponentially the inflation rate or the unemployment rate. Yeah, I think that's a that's a very good way of summarizing why there is so much debate and disagreement because a look again even setting aside the data blackout from the official sources there's confusion but then you add in the data blackout and then the questions about</p>

看，我的意思是，劳动力市场的风险是那种**非线性**，对吗？你会看到增加，然后增加，然后增加，然后突然之间你就会有非常严重的失业，你离你的使命目标非常远。通胀的风险是，是的，正如苏珊和其他人所指出的，他们长期以来一直未能达到目标。他们仍然没有回到目标。即使在苏珊的基线情景中，他们也需要一段时间才能回到目标。而且有人担心更深层次的问题会根深蒂固。我认为她说的她交谈过的联系人对他们在这种环境下能够转嫁价格的程度感到惊讶，这非常有趣。所以，是的，很容易看到所有不同的方式，你可以从中得出不确定性。更不用说政策本身，即通过关税等财政政策仍然存在不确定性。

<details>

<p class="english-text">look I mean the labor market r the risk to the labor market is that sort of nonlinearity right that you get an increase and then an increase and then an increase and then suddenly you have very severe unemployment you're very far away from your mandate. The risk to the inflation is that yeah, as as Susan and others have noted, they've been missing for a long time. They're still not back to their target. Even in Susan's base case, they don't get back to their target for a while. And there are concerns about something more deeper becoming embedded. I thought it was very interesting that she said that the contacts that she talked to have been surprised by the degree to which they could pass price in this environment. And so yeah, very easy to see all the different ways that you could derive uncertainty. Not to mention the fact that policy itself, the fiscal policy through tariffs and so forth remains uncertain there.</p>
</details>

绝对。我也觉得这很有趣。她谈到了一次性关税价格上涨需要一些时间才能实现。她回顾了他们将在**波士顿联储**讨论的关于2018年关税的研究论文，以及即使是那些回顾起来相当直接的关税也需要数月才能真正通过经济发挥作用。现在我们所处的情况是，关税，你知道，它们时有时无，而且关于接下来会发生什么有一些讨论。似乎很可能这些关税需要更长时间才能发挥作用。我应该说，我们将发布一期特别播客，我们将与许多在**波士顿联储**会议上发表演讲的研究人员进行对话。所以请留意。另外，如果您感兴趣，**波士顿联储**实际上将对这次会议进行直播，所以您可以在周五和周六实时关注，并听取所有论文的讨论。是的，所有PDF都在那里。所以这就是Tracy和我将在周五和周六要做的事情。我们将听取演讲者的发言。我们将阅读他们的PDF。她可以虚拟地加入我们，自己阅读所有PDF，并在**Discord**上与我们讨论。

<p class="english-text">Absolutely. I thought it was also really interesting. She was talking about the idea that the oneoff tariff price increase can take some time to materialize. and she called back to um the research paper that they're going to be discussing at the Boston Fed about the 2018 tariffs and this idea that even those which were you know looking back fairly straightforward took months to actually work their way through the economy. Now we're in a place where the tariffs you know they've been on and then they're off and there's some discussion about what's going to happen now. It seems likely that you could see that those would take even longer to work their way through. I should just say we are going to be releasing a special episode of the podcast where we talk to a lot of the researchers who are presenting at this Boston Fed conference. So look out for that. And also if you're interested the Boston Fed will actually be live streaming this conference so you can follow along in real time on Friday and Saturday and listen to all the papers actually get discussed. Yeah, all the PDFs are there. And so that's what Tracy and I are going to be doing on Friday and Saturday. We're going to be listening to speakers. We're going to be reading their PDFs.
