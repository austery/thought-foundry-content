title: 挪威银行气候大会：气候变化的宏观经济与金融影响
---
### 开幕致辞：气候风险即是金融风险

**Ida Wolden Bache：** 部长、各位贵宾、女士们、先生们，我非常荣幸能欢迎各位莅临2025年挪威银行气候大会，无论是在座的各位，还是在线上观看会议的朋友们。由于本次活动由挪威央行和挪威银行投资管理公司（NBIM）共同主办，我很高兴能与你，Nikolai，同台主持。

<p class="english-text">Minister, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honor and a privilege for me to welcome you to Norisbank Climate Conference 2025, both those of you present here today and those of you who are following the conference online. And as the central bank and NBIM are co-hosting this event, it is a pleasure to share the stage with you Nikolai.</p>
</details>

**Ida Wolden Bache：** 气候变化是我们这个时代最严峻的挑战之一。其后果深远广泛，威胁着生物多样性，破坏家园和基础设施，并将健康与生命置于危险之中。科学结论十分明确：全球变暖是由人类活动引起的，全球气温仍在持续上升。2024年是有记录以来最热的一年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time. Its consequences are far and wide, threatening biodiversity, damaging homes and infrastructure, and putting health and lives at risk. And the science is clear. Global warming is caused by human activity and global temperatures continue to rise. 2024 was the hottest year on record.</p>
</details>

**Ida Wolden Bache：** 然而，在全球充满不确定性的时代，我们很容易忽视气候危机。但应对这一危机仍然是一项紧迫的任务。今年是《巴黎协定》签署十周年，该协定旨在将全球变暖限制在比工业化前水平高1.5摄氏度的范围内。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But in a time of global uncertainty, it is easy to lose focus on the climate crisis. And yet, addressing it remains an urgent task. This year marks 10 years since the Paris Agreement was signed, aiming to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.</p>
</details>

**Ida Wolden Bache：** 然而，即使全世界成功限制了全球变暖，过去温室气体排放对气候的影响仍将在未来多年伴随着我们。无论是中央银行还是NBIM，都无法忽视这一事实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, even if the world manages to limit global warming, the impacts of past greenhouse gas emissions on the climate will remain with us for years to come. And neither the central bank nor the NBIM can ignore this fact.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai Tangen：** 没错。那么，让我从一个问题开始。在座有多少人去过罗马？相当多。那你们可能见过这座雕塑。它是卡比托利欧母狼，是罗马最著名的雕塑之一。它描绘了罗穆路斯和瑞摩斯这对双胞胎，根据神话，他们后来建立了罗马城。他们靠吸食母狼的乳汁得以存活，可以说，母狼成为了他们的地球母亲。那么，我想表达什么呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, that's right. So let me start with a question. How many of you have been to Rome? That's pretty good. Well then you may have seen this sculpture. It's the capital line wolf and is one of the most famous sculptures in Rome. Now it depicts two twins Romelus and Remis who according to the myth later went on to found the city and they survived by circling on the shewolf and she became their mother earth so to say. So where am I taking this?</p>
</details>

**Nikolai Tangen：** 好，第二个问题。你们有多少人去过国际大都市利勒斯特伦？很好。在这里，你可能会看到当代艺术家埃里克·帕尔的这件雕塑作品，也叫《卡比托利欧母狼》。那么，罗穆路斯和瑞摩斯发生了什么？他们是不是太贪婪了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, second question. How many of you have been to the cosmopolitan city of Lilism? That's good. Here you may find this sculpture by contemporary artist Eric Palt, the capital wolf, too. Now, what happened to Romelus and Remos? Quite greedy, aren't they?</p>
</details>

**Nikolai Tangen：** 我觉得这件作品形象地展示了当前正在发生的事情。如果我们日常的生活方式从长远来看是不可持续的，那么这就是将会发生的结果。经济和金融依赖于一个可持续的世界。气候影响经济，因此气候风险就是金融风险。虽然短期内吃饱喝足是件好事，但从长远来看，一切都需要可持续，而我们所有人都在追求长远发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I kind of think this is visualizing what's going on just now. If the way we live day-to-day is not sustainable in the long run, this is what's going to happen. Economics and finance are dependent on a sustainable world. Climate affects the economy and so therefore climate risk is a financial risk. And while being wellfed in the short term is a good thing in the long run it all needs to be sustainable and we are all in it for the long run.</p>
</details>

### 第一部分：气候科学及其宏观经济影响

#### Ida Wolden Bache：中央银行的角色

**Ida Wolden Bache：** 完全正确，Nikolai。减少排放的责任在于政治当局，他们也拥有最有效的工具。但气候变化和气候转型影响着经济，因此也影响着中央银行的工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely Nicolai. Now the responsibility for reducing emissions rests with political authorities who also have the most effective instruments. But climate change and the climate transition affect the economy and therefore it also affects the work of the central bank.</p>
</details>

**Ida Wolden Bache：** 十年前，时任英格兰银行行长的马克·卡尼发表了一篇题为《打破地平线悲剧：气候变化与金融稳定》的演讲。那次演讲将我们带入了一个新时代。中央银行开始更严肃地对待气候变化的影响，并于2017年由多家央行和金融监管机构发起了“央行与监管机构绿色金融网络”（Network for Greening the Financial System），其理念是通过合作与经验分享来改进我们的分析。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A decade ago, the then governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, gave a speech titled Breaking the Tragedy of the Horizon: Climate Change and Financial Stability. With that speech, he ushered us into a new era. Central banks started taking the effects of climate change more seriously and the network for greening the financial system was launched in 2017 by central banks and financial supervisors with the idea that we can approve our analysis by working together and sharing experiences.</p>
</details>

**Ida Wolden Bache：** 中央银行的职责是确保价格稳定和金融稳定。气候变化可以同时影响这两者。更频繁、更恶劣的天气事件可能导致通胀波动加剧，使实现价格稳定变得更加困难。例如，过去一年挪威食品和饮料价格的快速上涨，部分原因可以追溯到可可和咖啡价格的急剧上涨，而更深层次的原因则是巴西的干旱和西非的热浪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now central banks are mandated to ensure price stability and financial stability. Climate change can affect both. More frequent and more severe weather events can lead to increased inflation volatility and make it harder to achieve price stability. For example, the rapid rise in food and beverage prices in Norway over the past year can in part be traced back to a sharp increase in the prices of cocoa and coffee and further back to drafts in Brazil and heat waves in West Africa.</p>
</details>

**Ida Wolden Bache：** 确保金融稳定也可能变得更具挑战性。银行和保险公司可能会遭受更大的损失，这既来自于能源转型导致的商业部门重组，也来自于极端天气可能摧毁农作物和建筑物。因此，在我们的战略中，更好地理解气候变化对挪威经济的影响一直是一个优先事项。我们每天都在学习更多，但仍没有任何确切的答案。所以，气候变化正在影响中央银行的工作，但它同样也影响着你，Nikolai，所做的工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ensuring financial stability could also become more demanding. Banks and insurance companies may experience greater losses both from the restructuring of the business sector resulting from the energy transition but also from the fact that extreme weather can destroy both crops and buildings. So inspire strategy gaining a better understanding of the effects of climate change on the Norwegian economy has been a priority. We are learning more every day but still do not have any definite answers. So climate change is affecting the work of the central bank but it's also affecting the work you do Nikolai.</p>
</details>

#### Nikolai Tangen：主权财富基金的视角

**Nikolai Tangen：** 的确如此。我们基金的目标是在金融市场中创造回报，不是为我们自己，而是为了现在和未来的挪威人。我们进行长期投资，投资了70个国家的9000家公司，拥有全球所有上市公司约1.5%的股权。当你拥有全世界时，世界一个地方发生的事情会影响到其他地方。一家公司发生的事情会被所有其他公司所感知。这就是为什么气候变化会影响我们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely. So our fund uh our goal is to generate returns in financial markets not for ourselves but for gen for Norwegians now and future generations. We invest for the long term. We're invested in 9,000 companies across 70 countries and we own roughly one and a half% of all the listed equities in the world. Now when you own the whole world, what happens in one part of the world impacts the rest of it. What happens with one company is captured by all the other companies. That is why climate change impacts us.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai Tangen：** 气候风险是长期的、系统性的，并且非常不确定。但是，减缓和适应气候变化也创造了经济机会。我们的目标就是抓住这些机会。近20年来，我们一直致力于研究气候变化，以了解其对我们投资组合的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Climate risk is long-term, systematic and very uncertain. But mitigating and adapting to climate change also create economic opportunities. And our goal is to capture those opportunities. We worked on climate change for nearly 20 years to understand the effects on our portfolio.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai Tangen：** 三年前，我们启动了2025年气候行动计划，立志成为该领域的世界领先者。因为如果你有远大的抱负，即使稍有不足，也能取得伟大的成就。如果你的抱负很低，即使成功了，也几乎一事无成。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Three years ago, we launched the 2025 climate action plan with a very bold ambition to be the world leading in this area. Because if you have really high ambitions, you achieve great things even if you fall sh slightly short. If you have low ambitions, you achieve nearly nothing even if you succeed.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai Tangen：** 这十年对于实现有序的气候转型至关重要。这是一个复杂的过程，会有赢家和输家。一些高排放公司将会衰落甚至消失，而另一些则会转型和成长。我们的目标是推动我们投资的公司到2050年实现净零排放。这个目标指导我们所有的工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This decade is crucial for achieving an orderly climate transition. It's complex and there will be winners and losers. Some high emitting companies will decline and perhaps disappear while others will transform and grow. And OA goal is to drive our companies towards net zero emissions by 2050. And this target guides all our work.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai Tangen：** 那么，我们成功了吗？嗯，这是一场马拉松，而不是短跑。即使作为大型投资者，我们也需要其他所有人的帮助。我们与公司、标准制定者进行沟通，因为我们相信气候风险就是金融风险，管理好它是对业务有益的。我们目前的计划将于今年结束，但明天我们将发布2030年气候行动计划。不过现在不作任何剧透。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, are we succeeding? Well, this is a marathon and not a sprint. And even as large investors, we need the help from the rest of you. We engage with companies with standard setters because we believe that climate risk is a financial risk and managing it is good for business. Our current plan ends this year, but tomorrow we are launching the climate action plan 2030. But no spoilers now.</p>
</details>

#### Bjørn Samset：气候变化的戏剧性现实

**Bjørn Samset：** 如果气候变化真是一场舞台剧，而非残酷的现实，我们现在所处的节点将是极具戏剧性的。这会是剧中紧张气氛急剧升高的时刻，观众能真切地感受到有大事发生，而剧中的演员们却尚未意识到事态的严重性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was asked to set the stage for today's events. And if climate change was indeed a stage play and not hardcore reality, the point we're at would be a very dramatic one. It would be one of the points in the play where we really rack up the tension, where the audience really feels that something is going on and the actors of the play haven't realized the seriousness yet.</p>
</details>

**Bjørn Samset：** 当然，从科学角度来看，我们长期以来一直在监测气候变化，并且现在仍在继续。这种监测揭示了一些惊人的事实：气候变化本身目前似乎正在发生变化。其中一个变化是，人为引起的气候变化所带来的影响正逐年变得更加清晰。这不仅因为我们观察得更仔细，更因为我们能更敏锐地感受到这些影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We of course have been monitoring from the science side climate change for a long time and we still are. And this monitoring is revealing some dramatic facts that climate change itself currently seems to be changing. One of the changes is that the human impacts or so the impacts of human induced climate change are becoming clearer to us year-by-year. Not just because we're looking harder, but because we're feeling them more acutely.</p>
</details>

**Bjørn Samset：** 长期以来，气候变化是真实而剧烈的，但其变化程度仍与天气波动相当。然而，现在情况已不再如此，这一点从我们年复一年看到的、由气候变化助长的自然灾害中显而易见。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For a long time, climate change has been real and dramatic, but still its changes have been on par with ve weather variations. This is no longer the case as is evident from all the natural disasters natural disasters that are fueled by climate change that we keep seeing year-by-year.</p>
</details>

**Bjørn Samset：** 我们可以举些例子：2022年巴基斯坦的洪水，始于一场因气候变化而加剧的热浪。随后到来的季风季节也因气候变化而变得更加猛烈，这两者结合导致该国约十分之一的地区被淹，造成了长期后果。这样的灾难不是一夜之间就能清理干净的。2023年，我们经历了加拿大历史性的严重火灾，不仅对当地造成影响，其影响还远及整个北极地区。这场火灾只是北极地区众多火灾的例子之一。北极正在燃烧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We can take examples the 2022 flood in Pakistan which was started by a heat wave made worse by climate change. Then came the monsoon season which was also more intense by climate change made more intense by climate change and the combination of these two led to about a tenth of the country falling underwater with long-term consequences. You do not clean up something like that overnight. 2023 we had the historically strong fires of Canada with local effects but also with long ranging effects across the Arctic. And this fire is only one of many examples of fires in the Arctic. The Arctic is burning.</p>
</details>

**Bjørn Samset：** 2024年，瓦伦西亚发生了前所未有的洪水，造成了灾难性影响。瓦伦西亚洪水影响如此严重的原因之一是，地方当局直到为时已晚才真正相信情况会变得那么糟糕。不幸的是，同样的故事在2025年的德克萨斯州重演。但我会举另一个例子，这个例子至少在挪威新闻中没有得到那么多关注，那就是尼泊尔及周边地区发生的一系列冰川崩塌，随之而来的是洪水和巨大的损失。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">2024 we had the unprecedented floods in Valencia with their catastrophic impacts. One of the reasons that the impacts of the Valencia flood became as bad as they were is that the local authorities did not really believe it could get that bad until it was too late. The same story unfortunately was repeated in 2025 in Texas. But I'll take another example which hasn't reached at least the Norwegian news as quite as much and that is a series of glacier collapses in Nepal and surrounding regions with ensuing floods and massive massive damages.</p>
</details>

**Bjørn Samset：** 所有这些都只是造成重大后果的自然事件的例子，我们现在知道，这些事件因气候变化而变得更糟、更强烈、更频繁。这就是科学告诉我们的。这是一个来自英国一个名为“世界天气归因”（World Weather Attribution）组织的概览示例，该组织定期追踪所有这些重大事件，挑选出最具破坏性的，并检验科学界对该特定事件的看法。图中你看到的每一个红点，都代表2024年发生的一场因气候变化而加剧的灾难性破坏事件。每一个蓝点，则代表一场因气候变化而变得更不可能发生的事件。眼尖的人会发现，少数几个蓝点之一就在我们站立的这里。那是一个寒冷的冬天。所以，如果你还记得24年初的那个寒冬，请记住它，因为以后你会越来越少见到这样的冬天了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All these are but examples of na events with major consequences that we now know have been made worse, more intense and more frequent by by climate change. This is where science takes us. This is an example of an overview from the grouping, the UK grouping called World Weather Attribution, which routinely tracks all these major events, picks out the most damaging ones and checks what does science say about this particular event. And everywhere you see a red dot, there was a catastrophic damaging event in 2024 that was made worse by climate change. Everywhere you see a blue dot, there was an event that was made less likely by climate change. And those of you with sharp eyes will see that one of the few blue dots is here where we're standing. That was a cold winter. So those of you who remember the cold winter of early 24, remember that one because you will be seeing less of it.</p>
</details>

**Bjørn Samset：** 但真正的戏剧性不一定在于极端事件本身。我们正在了解这些事件，并学会适应它们。戏剧性在于其背后，因为驱动这些极端事件的当然是全球变暖。地球正在变暖，地表温度升高，气候变得更加极端，降水增多。所以问题就变成了：全球变暖正在发生什么？本世纪最重要的图表或许就是这张。这是从1850年至今的全球变暖情况。如果你只看过一张气候科学的图表，那很可能就是这张。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the real drama is not necessarily the extreme events themselves. We are learning about those. We are learning to adapt to them. The drama lies behind because what is driving these extreme events is of course global warming. The fact that the earth is getting warmer, the surface is getting warmer, the climate is getting more extreme, there is more precipitation. So the question becomes what is happening to global warming? Maybe the most important graph of this century is this one. This is global warming from 1850 until today. It's probably the one graph you've seen.</p>
</details>

**Bjørn Samset：** 这种持续的演变一直很稳定，以至于当**IPCC**（Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: 联合国政府间气候变化专门委员会，负责评估气候变化相关科学的国际机构）在2028年发布其1.5摄氏度报告时，他们对我们将何时达到1.5摄氏度的评估仅仅是通过画一条直线得出的，这在当时是很有道理的。然而，自2018年以来，甚至更早一些时候，全球变暖一直在加速。坦率地说，从自然科学的角度，我们并不完全知道原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This constant evolution has been steady enough that when the IPCC made its one and a half degree report in 2028, their assessment of when we would hit 1.5 degrees was made just by drawing a straight line which was well justified. However, since 2018 and somewhat before, global warming has been speeding up. And if you're honest from the natural science side, we do not fully know why.</p>
</details>

**Bjørn Samset：** 引起广泛关注的一件事是，2020年发生了一件非常积极的事情：国际海事组织规定，航运燃料中不应再含有硫。这非常好。但这也意味着，排放硫之后发生的过程停止了。这个过程是什么？你通常不会想到。嗯，这是大气中的化学反应。你排放硫，它进入大气并形成颗粒，这些小颗粒会反射阳光。所以，航运燃料在某种程度上为地球降温做出了贡献，虽然只是一点点。这一特定变化引起了很多关注。我们现在认为，它不是导致过去几年异常温暖的主要原因，但它仍然受到很多关注，我们仍需关注它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So one thing that has got a lot of attention was the fact that in 2020 um something really positive happened that the international maritime organization mandated that sulfur should no longer be a part of shipping fuels. That is excellent. But it also means that um the sulfur or the process that happens after you emit sulfur stopped. What is this process? Not something you usually think about. Well, it's chemistry in the atmosphere. You emit sulfur. It gets up in the atmosphere and it forms particles and these small particles reflect sunlight. So, the shipping fuel contributed to cooling the Earth somewhat, a little bit. This particular change has gotten a lot of attention. We now believe it is not the major contributor to the fact that the last few years have been very warm, but it still gets a lot of attention and we still need to focus on it.</p>
</details>

**Bjørn Samset：** 然而，在大约相同的时间尺度上，同样的事情实际上也发生在中国。空气污染是全世界和所有工业区的一个主要问题。许多工业区努力消除空气污染并取得了很大进展。在欧洲和美国，空气污染已经不多了。然而，在亚洲，特别是南亚和东亚，几十年来空气污染一直在严重增长。那种空气污染也一直在为地球降温。所以，我们自己的污染带来了相当强的降温效应。现在，中国大约在10-15年前决定对此采取行动。而当中国决定做某件事时，他们效率很高。所以他们真的成功了。因此，在这段时间里，中国燃煤电厂、其他工厂和道路交通产生的硫约有80%消失了。这表明，或者说我们和其他科学家已经能够证明，这实际上在过去10到15年里加速了全球变暖。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Something else that has happened though over about the same time scale is that the same has actually happened in China. Air pollution is a major concern across the world and in all industrial regions. Many industrial regions have worked hard to remove air pollution and have gotten far uh in the uh Europe in Europe and in the US there isn't all that much air pollution left. However, in Asia, in particular in South and East Asia, there has for many decades been a strong growth in air pollution. That air pollution has also been cooling the earth. So, we've had quite strong cooling from our own pollution. Now, China about 10-15 years ago decided to do something about this. And when China decides to do something, they are efficient. So, they really succeeded. So about 80% of the sulfur from Chinese coal fire power plants and other factories and road traffic has disappeared over this time scale. So it shows that or we we we've been able to show we and other scientists that this has actually contributed to speeding up global warming over the last 10 to 15 years.</p>
</details>

**Bjørn Samset：** 当然，这有点戏剧性，因为你消除一个负面影响，却得到了另一个。但另一方面，这也意味着这只是全球变暖速度的暂时增长。这可能是积极的。然而，现在我们已经使地球变暖，或者说我们正在使地球变暖，地球正在做出反应。其中一件事情我已经向你们展示过，那就是北极的火灾。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now that's of course a little bit dramatic because you remove one negative effect and you get another. On the other hand, it also means that this was a temporary growth in the speed of global warming. That is potentially positive. However, there are other things happening now that we've warmed the earth, of course, or we are warming the earth. The earth is responding. One of these things I showed you already. It is the fires in the Arctic.</p>
</details>

**Bjørn Samset：** 另一个我们很少想到的反馈是遥远的太平洋上正在发生的事情。我敢打赌，这里没有人会太关注太平洋中部发生的事情。然而，我们科学家会，我们正在看到太平洋上空的云层覆盖发生变化，很可能是对全球变暖的响应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Another feedback that rarely crosses our minds is what's going on far out in the Pacific. I'm willing to bet that nobody here pays much attention to the goings on in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. However, we we scientists do and we're seeing changes in the cloud cover over the Pacific, most likely in response to the world warming.</p>
</details>

**Bjørn Samset：** 但当然，最主要的影响是我们每年仍在创造二氧化碳排放的新纪录。这现在是，并将继续是变暖的主要原因。我们不要改变或回避这一事实。我们越是使地球变暖，出现的问题就越多，因为我们不知道地球变暖后会发生什么。我们以前从未进行过这个实验。我们正处于未知领域，我知道今天晚些时候我们会听到更多关于这方面的内容。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But of course the main effect is the fact that we are still setting records in CO2 emissions every year. This is and will continue to be the main cause of warming. Let us not change this fact or or um get away from from this fact. And the more we warm the earth, the more questions appear because we do not know what will happen to the earth as it warms. We have never performed this experiment before. We are in unknown territory as I know we will hear more about later on today.</p>
</details>

**Bjørn Samset：** 当然，我们能够做出预测，而现在最重要的预测是，无论我们今天如何改变排放，我们仍然面临着几十年的快速全球变暖。这是一个令人沮丧的信息，但也是一个重要的信息。然而，这并非唯一的信息。那之后会发生什么，将受到我们今天决策的重大影响。所以，不要认为我们的决策不重要，只是它们在更长远的未来才显现其重要性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Of course, however, we are able to give projections and the most important projection now is that regardless of our emission changes today, we are still looking at several decades of rapid global warming. That is a depressing message, but it is an important message. is however not the only message. What happens after that is significantly impacted by our decisions today. So do not think that our decisions do not matter. It's just that they matter in the longer term.</p>
</details>

**Bjørn Samset：** 随着气候变化的迅速发展，我们现在除了尽快削减排放外，最重要的信息是，无论我们计划什么，无论是工业、社会，还是为自己的家庭，我们都必须为一个比今天更暖、更湿、更狂野的气候做准备。因为无论如何，这都将是我们将要面临的。如果我们这样做，我们就能适应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So with climate change progressing rapidly, the most important message we have now except cut emissions as rapidly as we can is that whatever we plan, be it industrial, be it societal, be it for your own family, we must plan for a climate that is much warmer, much wetter, and much wilder than today. because that is what we will get regardless. If we do this, we can adapt.</p>
</details>

**Bjørn Samset：** 关键在于，我们需要削减排放，但同时，我们也需要为一个气候更狂野的未来做规划，因为气候变化正在变得越来越强，它将变得更强，而且不会消失。谢谢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The point is we need to cut emissions but at the same time we need to plan for a future with a wilder climate because climate change is getting stronger. It will become stronger and it is not going away. Thank you.</p>
</details>

#### Solomon Hsiang：气候变化的经济影响

**Solomon Hsiang：** 我想和大家谈谈，我们如何思考这些地球的剧烈变化可能带来的宏观经济影响。这里有一张图，顶部根据各国未来的温度和过去历史温度的分布来定位。通过这张图，你可以进行纵向比较，例如，我们预计未来挪威的温度会更像今天的德国。我们还预计，未来印度尼西亚会更像苏丹。然后，非常重要的一点是，我们预计苏丹的未来将是我们前所未见的。那么，我们如何理解这种分布上看似简单的转变对全球经济意味着什么呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to talk to you about how we think about what the macroeconomic implications of these dramatic changes to the planet might mean. So here's a graph where on the top you see countries sort of positioned based on where their temperatures might be in the future and where their distribution of historical temperatures have been in the past. And so what you can do with this graph is you can make vertical comparisons and see for example that in the future we expect the temperature of Norway to look more analogous to what we see in Germany today. We also expect in the future Indonesia will look more like Sudan. And then quite importantly, we expect that Sudan will look like nothing we've ever seen before. So how do we understand what this shift, seemingly simple shift in the distribution might mean for the global economy?</p>

**Solomon Hsiang：** 我很想做的是那种科学展览式的实验，我拿两个星球，把其中一个加热，然后事后观察，了解这两个星球的经济状况有何不同。这显然是一个难以进行的实验。所以，我们转而采用一种类似自然实验或准实验的方法，我们长期跟踪人群，当他们经历不同气候时，我们观察他们的经济如何反应。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So the thing I would love to do is the sort of science fair version of the experiment where I take two planets and I heat up one of them and I look after the fact to understand what the economies of the two look like. That's obviously a difficult experiment to run. So what we do instead is something that's like a natural experiment, a quasi experiment where we follow populations over time and as they experience different climates, we observe what their economy does in response.</p>
</details>

**Solomon Hsiang：** 在我们进行这类分析之前，人们对于国家如何应对这类极端灾害有不同的理论。这里x轴是时间，y轴是GDP。顶部的线标记为“创造性破坏”理论。这个理论认为，这些事件或许能震动社会，改变经济。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So people before we had done this type of analysis had had different theories about how countries might respond to these types of extreme disasters. So here on the x-axis you see time and on the y- axis is sort of GDP. So the top line here is labeled sort of a creative destruction idea. It's a theory that maybe these events kind of jostle society. They change the economy.</p>
</details>

**Solomon Hsiang：** 另一种理论是“重建得更好”的观念。也许我们没有以高效的速度更新经济中的资本，所以一场风暴来袭，清除了一些旧资本。我们重建，那就是更好的新资本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Another theory is this build back be better notion. Maybe we don't replenish the capital in the economy at the efficient rate and so a storm comes through it clears out some old capital. We rebuild and that's new capital that's better.</p>
</details>

**Solomon Hsiang：** 第三种观点是“恢复至趋势水平”。也许真正重要的是全球技术的前沿。因此，随着全球前沿的推进，各国最终都会赶上。第四种假设是“无法恢复”。遭受这样的灾难，对一个经济体来说，基本上等同于时光倒流。你摧毁了资本，我们只能重新建设。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The third idea here is this recovery to trend. Maybe really what matters is the frontier of global technology. And so as the global frontier moves forward, countries will just catch up to that frontier over time. And the fourth hypothesis is that there's no recovery. Getting hit by a disaster like this is essentially the same as moving backwards in time for an economy. You destroy capital and we simply just have to rebuild it again.</p>
</details>

**Solomon Hsiang：** 当你观察世界各地数千场风暴时，我们发现，“无法恢复”的假设实际上是大多数国家所经历的情况。在一场飓风过后的20年里，我们看到经济相对于趋势水平有所下滑，且从未恢复。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When you look at thousands of storms around the world, what we see is that this no recovery hypothesis is actually what we see what occurs to most countries. So over the course of 20 years after a hurricane, we see that the economy declines relative to trend somewhat slowly and never recovers.</p>
</details>

**Solomon Hsiang：** 当我们将这些计算与我们的估算相匹配时，我们认为在12小时内，波多黎各基本上倒退了四分之一个世纪的经济发展。这些早期的预测似乎已在实地得到证实。我们用这张图还想说明一点，这些灾难的规模可与其他类型的金融危机相提并论，而我们在这个房间里讨论后者时，通常会给予更多关注。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When we match those types of calculations to our estimates, what we think is that in the course of 12 hours, Puerto Rico basically reversed a quarter century of economic development. And sort of these projections which came out early on seem to have been borne out on the ground. One point we also make with this graph is that the scale of these disasters is comparable to other type of financial crises that we in this room often talk about maybe with a bit more attention.</p>
</details>

**Solomon Hsiang：** 当你汇总数据时，你会发现整个宏观经济的生产率遵循着这样一条曲线。这里x轴是一个国家的平均温度，y轴是GDP产出。我们看到，随着温度升高，生产率趋于增加。有时在一些新研究中，它实际上会更平坦一些。然后在大约15到13摄氏度时达到顶峰，之后开始下降。这里的下降斜率大约是每摄氏度1%到1.5%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when you aggregate the data is that the productivity over the overall macroeconomy follows this type of curve. Okay? And so what you have here is on the x-axis the average temperature of a country and on the y-axis output in of GDP. What we see is that as temperatures increase, productivity tends to increase. Sometimes it's actually a little flatter in some newer studies. And then at around 15 to 13 degrees Celsius, it peaks and then begins to decline. And the slope of the decline here is about one to one and a half percent per degree Celsius.</p>
</details>

**Solomon Hsiang：** 这条曲线，如果你从这次演讲中记不住其他任何东西，那么这条曲线可能比我们研究过的任何其他东西都更能说明未来全球经济的结构。

<p class="english-text">This curve, if you don't remember anything else from this talk, this curve probably after 15 years of research, I've decided that this curve probably has more to do with the structure of the future global economy than anything else we've looked at.</p>
</details>

**Solomon Hsiang：** 你可以问，我们是否在适应？世界在变，我们有很多技术，非常先进。情况有变吗？我们是否找到了更有效应对温度的方法？答案是否定的。我们没有发现任何证据表明全球经济对其对平均温度的反应方式正在改变。你可以纵观历史，我们今天看到的情况和60年代看到的一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you can ask, are we adapting? You know, the world is like we have a lot of technology. It's very sophisticated. Have things changed? Are we figuring out how to cope with temperature more effectively? The answer is no. We find no evidence that the global economy is changing and how responsive it is to average temperatures. You can look over time and what we see today is the same thing we saw in the 60s.</p>
</details>

**Solomon Hsiang：** 你也可以看看世界各地不同类型的数据集。无论你看像美国这样非常富裕的国家，还是看迅速发展的中国，或者看印度、巴西，以及世界银行做的数百个家庭调查，我们看到的基本上都是同样的形状，一遍又一遍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can also look around the world at different types of data sets. Whether you look at a very wealthy country like the United States, whether you look at China, rapidly developing, whether you look at India, Brazil, hundreds of household surveys done by the World Bank, we see essentially the same shape over and over again.</p>
</details>

**Solomon Hsiang：** 我们估计，在过去的几十年里，由于已经发生的气候变暖，我们已经损失了数万亿美元的收入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we estimate that over the last several decades, we've already foregone several trillion dollars in income because of warming that has already occurred to date.</p>
</details>

**Solomon Hsiang：** 如果你对这些国家施加气候变化的影响，你会看到增长率的下降。对于较热的国家来说，下降幅度更大，因为它们处于那条曲线的下行部分。如果你将此推演下去，并询问这对未来全球经济结构意味着什么，你会一遍又一遍地看到具有这种基本结构的地图：整个热带和亚热带地区有巨大的经济影响，而在高纬度地区，影响可能较小，在某些情况下甚至是积极的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if you were to impose climate change on these countries, what you see is a depression of growth rates. And the depression is larger for hotter countries because they're on that downward sloping side of that curve. uh if you were to roll that forward and ask what does that mean for what the structure of the global economy looks like in the future you over and over see maps that have this basic structure where throughout the tropics and the subtropics you have large economic impacts and then at higher latitudes you might have smaller impacts in some cases positive impacts.</p>
</details>

**Solomon Hsiang：** 当你把全球产出加起来，并询问这对世界GDP意味着什么时，我们看到了下降。尽管存在很大的不确定性，但根据人们使用的不同模型，其规模大约是GDP的20%到40%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, first of all, when you add up global output and ask what are the implications for world GDP, we see a decline. And that there's a great deal of uncertainty, but it's to the tune of 20 to 40% of GDP depending on the different types of models people use.</p>
</details>

**Solomon Hsiang：** 第三点是，由于受宏观经济影响最大的热带和亚热带地区今天也是世界上较贫穷的地区，我们得出了这样的图表：世界上较贫穷的三分之二地区正以更强的强度、更大的宏观经济影响经历着气候变化。因此，未来由于变暖而出现的分化就产生了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The third point is that because the tropical regions and that subtropical regions that have the greatest impact on their macroeconomy are today also the poorer regions of the world. We generate graphs that look like this where the poorer two-thirds of the world are experiencing climate change with much more intensity, much greater macroeconomic impact. So that you have this divergence in the future that emerges as a result of warming.</p>
</details>

**Solomon Hsiang：** 我们看到，对于非洲相当一部分国家来说，由于“一切照旧”的情景，持续经济衰退的风险增加了大约25%。我们认为这是一个重大风险，我们很多新的工作都试图集中在这个问题上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what we see is that for a substantial fraction of countries in Africa, the risk of persistent economic decline increases by roughly 25% due to sort of business as-usual scenarios. We think that this is a major risk and a lot of our new work is trying to focus on this type of question.</p>
</details>

**Solomon Hsiang：** 总结一下，我想给你们留下几条直接的要点。首先，证据非常清楚，我向你们展示的高温和热带气旋减缓了GDP增长。温度的影响是高度非线性的，这对未来全球收入分配的结构非常重要。从历史上看，我们没有看到适应的证据。在过去的几十年里，近期的变暖已经大幅减缓了增长，全球范围内损失达数十万亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So to wrap up, I want to leave you with a few sort of straightforward take-home messages. The first is that the evidence is very clear that high temperatures and in tropical cyclones that I've shown you slow GDP growth. The effective temperature is highly nonlinear and this is very important for the structure of the global income distribution in the future. Historically we see no evidence of adaptation. And recent warming over the last several decades has already substantially slowed growth to the tune of tens of trillions of dollars worldwide.</p>
</details>

**Solomon Hsiang：** 到2100年，我们预计每变暖一度，全球GDP将减少约10%。这可以作为你心中的一个基准数字。我们现在真正担心的是，宏观经济衰退和政治不稳定的耦合，对于世界上某些风险特别高的经济体来说，可能是灾难性的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By 2100, we project that every one degree of warming will lead to a reduction of global GDP by roughly 10%. That's sort of like a benchmark number you can hold in your mind. And we have real concerns now that sort of the coupling of macroeconomic decline and political instability could be really disastrous for certain economies in the world that are at particularly high risk.</p>
</details>

**Solomon Hsiang：** 最后一点，我没有过多谈论，是关于**碳的社会成本**（Social Cost of Carbon: 指每排放一吨二氧化碳所造成的经济损失）的概念。如果我们试图计算一个单一的数字，代表排放一吨二氧化碳对全球经济造成的总体经济损害，这个数字会是多少？根据这些新的宏观经济计算和在座其他人的工作，新的估算表明，仅通过对GDP的影响，这些成本就大约是每吨二氧化碳1000到2000美元，并带有相当大的不确定性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Finally, the last point which I haven't talked too much about is that there's this idea of the social cost of carbon which is if we try to compute a single number that represents the overall economic harm to the global economy as a result of the emission of one ton of CO2, what would that number be? And based on these various new macroeconomic calculations and other work in the room here, uh, new estimates are suggesting that just through the channel of the effects on GDP, these costs amount to roughly 1,000 to 2,000 US per ton of CO2 with some substantial uncertainty.</p>

#### Amelia Garcia-Appendini：极端天气对挪威家庭的影响

**Amelia Garcia-Appendini：** 当我告诉别人我正在写一篇估算自然灾害对挪威经济影响的论文时，我经常得到的反应是：“哦，挪威有自然灾害吗？”尤其是来自南欧的朋友们，我经常得到这种反应。似乎有一种看法，认为挪威在很大程度上免受了气候变化最坏的影响。当然，我们知道这不是真的，正如这张在极端天气“汉斯”袭击挪威后拍摄的照片所示。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when I tell people that I'm working on a paper that is estimating the impacts of natural disasters on the Norwegian economy, the reaction that I often get is, "Oh, are there natural disasters in Norway? Uh especially from my friends from southern uh Europe, I get this reaction." So there seems to be this perception that Norway is pretty much shielded from the worst effects of climate change. Um, of course we know this is not true as shown by this image which was taken after extreme weather hands hit Norway.</p>
</details>

**Amelia Garcia-Appendini：** 我们发现，以美元计价并经通胀调整后的赔付金额，随着时间的推移大幅增加。如果我们考虑受到特别严重事件影响的挪威市镇数量，这个数字也随时间增长。我们将严重事件定义为那些导致保险赔付至少占当地收入5%的事件。这是一个很大的数字。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So this is what we found. So these are uh in US dollars and deflated amounts. So we see that the payouts have increased enormously over the time. And if we think about the number of Norwegian municipalities that have been hit by especially strong uh events like this that has also increased over time. So we define strong events as those that cause that for which payouts insurance payouts are at least 5% of the local income. So that is uh that is a lot.</p>
</details>

**Amelia Garcia-Appendini：** 正是因为挪威的保险是全民性的，人们会因极端天气事件的直接损失得到赔偿。因此，我们所估算的，以及我将向你们展示的结果，基本上是这些极端天气事件对挪威经济产生更广泛影响所带来的间接冲击。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now precisely because the insurance in Norway is universal people are going to be paid back for the direct damages of the extreme weather events. So what we are estimating and what I will show you the results are basically the indirect impacts of these extreme weather events um due to broader repercussions of the extreme weather on the Norwegian economy.</p>
</details>

**Amelia Garcia-Appendini：** 灾难发生后，我们发现收入出现了急剧下降。累计下降额约为720美元。然后我们更仔细地研究了这些数据，发现这个税后收入的结果，基本上是由劳动收入驱动的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now of course after the disaster we found that there was a sharp decrease in the income. So cumulatively the decrease was about $720 US. Um then we zoomed in a little bit closer on these data and we found that this result which is for income after taxes was basically driven by income uh from labor labor income.</p>
</details>

**Amelia Garcia-Appendini：** 财富方面的情况同样不容乐观。我们发现，在灾难发生后的两年里，受事件影响的挪威人的财富损失了约13,000美元。我们还发现，这一结果源于挪威人住房财富的减少，这很可能是由于当地房价下跌所致。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now the picture is similarly negative for wealth. So we we found that after the disaster, Norwegians that were affected by the by by the events, extreme events, saw a loss in their wealth in the two years after the disaster of about 13,000 US. We also found that this result comes from a decrease in the housing wealth of the Norwegians, which is most likely due to a drop in the housing prices in the local area.</p>
</details>

**Amelia Garcia-Appendini：** 消费的下降同样显著，大约是收入下降的两倍。在灾难发生后的三年里，消费下降了1460美元。这可能还是对消费真实影响的低估，因为这部分消费中至少有一部分是用于修复和更换受损资产，而这些费用后来由保险公司报销了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we see that the fall in consumption is um also notable and it's about twice as large as the fall in income. So 100461,460 US over the three years after the disaster. Okay. And this is probably an over an underestimate of the true impact of on consumption because at least one part of this consumption was used to repair and replace the assets that that were damaged and that were then reimbursed by the insurance company.</p>
</details>

**Amelia Garcia-Appendini：** 我们的研究有三个主要结论。首先，即使在挪威，极端天气事件如今也正变得越来越频繁、代价越来越高。其次，尽管挪威人有幸能够获得保险，免受气候变化最严重、最直接的影响，但受影响的家庭仍在收入、财富和消费方面经历了剧烈且持续的下降。最后，我们发现，当企业，即地方经济受到特别严重的打击时，这将影响到个人的收入，并可能通过房价影响挪威人的消费，导致其下降。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the first one is that already today extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and more costly even in Norway. The second main result is that well despite the fact that Norwegians are fortunate enough to be uh insured against the worst impacts of climate change about the direct impacts of of such extreme weather events. Affected households are seeing a strong and also persistent uh decline in their income, their wealth and their consumption. And finally, given the richness of the administrative data that we uh can access in Norway, we also could shed some light on the mechanisms that drive these decreases in the income and wealth and consumption of the affected households. And we saw that when firms so the local economy is particularly hit that is going to hit the individual's income and through possibly through uh housing prices consumption of Norwegians is going to fall.</p>

### 第二部分：能源转型与政策挑战

#### Diego Känzig：气候政策的宏观经济影响

**Diego Känzig：** 气候变化可能是我们这个时代的决定性问题，给我们的生活、生计以及全球经济带来了毁灭性的风险。作为经济学家，我们原则上知道如何解决这个问题，那就是必须为碳定价。通过这种方式，我们让排放者内化其产生排放所带来的成本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Climate change is probably the defining problem of our time leading to devastating risks to our lives like livelihoods and also the global economy. As economists, we know how to solve the problem in principle, right? We have to put a price on carbon. In this way, we make emitters internalize the costs that are associated with producing emissions.</p>
</details>

**Diego Känzig：** 基于我们对**欧盟排放交易体系**（European Emissions Trading Scheme: 世界上最大的碳市场，通过“总量管制与交易”机制为碳排放定价）二十多年的经验，我们了解到以下几点：国家层面的碳定价政策在减少排放方面是有效的吗？是的，我们已经看到，现行的碳价导致了排放量的大幅减少。但当我们审视宏观经济效应时，我们也看到这些政策伴随着不可忽视的宏观经济成本，并且这些成本在社会各阶层中分配不均，较贫穷和较年轻的家庭承担了更大比例的负担。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So based on our experience with like 20 plus years of EUS we have learned the following. So our national carbon pricing policies effective at reducing emissions. Yes we have seen that these current prices led to a substantial reduction in emissions. But when we look at the macroeconomic effects, we also saw that these come with uh non-negligible macroeconomic costs and these costs turn out to be unequally distributed across society with poorer households with younger households uh shouldering a larger a much larger share of the burden.</p>
</details>

**Diego Känzig：** 我认为这确实表明，解决这些碳定价政策的经济和分配效应非常重要，而且我们有能力做到。事实上，我的一些研究表明，如果你采用有针对性的转移支付，即针对那些受政策影响最严重的家庭，你既可以减轻政策对经济的总体影响，也可以缓解其分配影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um so I think this really shows that it's important to address the economic and distributional effects of these carbon pricing policies and we can do so. So in fact I I have some work that shows if you use targeted transfers so you target the households that are more affected by most affected by the policy you can mitigate both the aggregate effects of the policy and the economy and also the distributional impacts.</p>
</details>

#### Bård Harstad：气候政策协调的“化石燃料陷阱”

**Bård Harstad：** 思考气候政策的传统方式是将其视为一个搭便车问题，或者经济学家所说的囚徒困境博弈。除非你思考如何改变游戏规则，使我们能够在国家间达成减排协议，否则继续一切照旧是这个博弈的唯一均衡。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to start out with a traditional way of thinking about um climate policies. Uh namely that we typically we think about it as a free rider problem or economists would call it a prisoner dilemma game. Unless you think about ways to change the game to make it possible that we have an agreement among countries where emissions are cut. That is why this is a unique equilibrium of this game.</p>
</details>

**Bård Harstad：** 另一个视角是，我们应该把它看作一个协调博弈。如果投资者预期未来会有非常雄心勃勃的环保政策，使得这些投资有利可图，并且比投资于替代性的传统行业更有利可图，那么他们就会投资于绿色资本、可再生能源和减排技术。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Another perspective is that we should think about it as a is a as a coordination game where we will have investments in green capital, renewably energy, abatement technologies if those investors anticipate that there will be a very ambitious environmental policy in the future making those investments profitable and more profitable than investing in alternative traditional sectors.</p>
</details>

**Bård Harstad：** 问题在于，我们起步时，有大量资本沉淀在传统行业，这些行业相对严重依赖化石燃料能源。正因如此，政策制定者难以推行环保政策和雄心勃勃的政策。因此，我们可能陷入了所谓的“绿色第二十二条军规”：世界之所以未能解决气候变化问题，部分原因是我们陷入了这个“棕色陷阱”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The problem is that we start here with a relatively much capital that is sunk in traditional sectors which are relatively much bullying on fossil fuel energy and because of that it's difficult for policy makers to introduce environmental policies and ambitious policies. So um so we might then be in what we call a green uh catch 22 that the world has not been able and that is part of the reason why the world has not been able to address climate change is because we are stuck in this brown trap.</p>
</details>

**Bård Harstad：** 更多的天然气可以替代煤炭，而煤炭的碳含量大约是天然气的两倍。这种效应在短期内似乎最为重要，因为短期内难以改变可再生能源的生产量和产能。但在长期，当投资者今天认为未来20、30年会有更多天然气时，对可再生能源的投资可能会下降。因此，长期来看，天然气可能取代的是可再生能源，而不是煤炭。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">more natural gas can replace coal and coal has a larger maybe approximately twice the carbon content of natural gas. And this effect seems to be most important in the short term because in the short term it's difficult to change the amount and the capacity to produce renewable energy. but when gas when more gas is anticipated when investors today think that in 20 30 years from now there will be more natural gas then investments in re renewables can fall and so in the long term gas can replace renewables instead of coal.</p>
</details>

**Bård Harstad：** 这就是我们所说的“天然气陷阱”。我们固定所有其他因素，如果只看气候变化影响这一个孤立因素的微小变化，那么如果你无法约束自己的手脚，如果你无法做出承诺，这会激励你生产更多的化石燃料，因为这会挤出煤炭。但对此的预期是可再生能源将会减少，最终你可能会排放更多的温室气体。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So so so that is why we call it the gas trap. The higher so so remember what we did we fixing everything else. If you look at a small change in one isolated thing namely the effect of climate change that will motivate if you cannot tie your hands if you are temp if you cannot commit that will motivate you to produce more fossil fuel that will because that will squeeze out coal but the anticipation of this is that renewables will fall and you can end up with more emissions.</p>
</details>

**Bård Harstad：** 解决方案是关注你的重要决策将如何影响预期，因为在这样的协调博弈中，预期是自我实现的。如果投资者和其他国家预期《巴黎协定》会失败，它就会失败。如果预期改变，投资就会改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the solutions is to pay attention to how you your important decisions will affect expectations because expectations are self-fulfilling in such a coordination game. If investors and other countries expect that the Paris agreement will fail, it will fail. If expectations change, investments will change.</p>
</details>

#### Hilde C. Bjørnland：挪威能源转型的挑战

**Hilde C. Bjørnland：** 谈到挪威能源转型的挑战，我可以给你两种叙事。一种是，与其他石油生产国相比，我们装备精良。但我也能给你另一种叙事，一种更具挑战性的叙事。这种叙事与我们即将面临的双重挑战有关：我们的石油资源将要减少，同时我们和其他国家一样，必须适应气候变化。最重要的是，我还要谈到，与非石油生产的经合组织国家相比，我们已经将自己置于一个在内部使用公共资源方面成为世界冠军的境地。我将选择第二条路径来讲述这些挑战，因为我认为这很重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So talking about uh challenges with regard to the energy transition for Norway, I could give you two narratives. One could be like compared to other oil producing countries, we are extremely well equipped. But I could also give you another narrative. A narrative which is a little bit more challenging. A narrative which is related to the fact that we are going to face a double challenge over petroleum resources are going to go down. At the same time as we as everybody else has to adapt to the climate change and on top of that I'm going to also talk about the fact that compared not to the oil producing countries but to other OCD countries we have put ourselves in a situation where we are world champion in using of resources public resources internally and I will take that second route in talking about the challenges this narrative because I think that's important.</p>
</details>

**Hilde C. Bjørnland：** 尽管我们储蓄了很多，但我们也花了很多。在挪威，我们讨论这个问题时，典型的论点是，是的，我们花了很多，但我们本就应该花很多，因为我们正在逐步投入大量资金。但由于石油基金增长如此之快，随着时间的推移，从中拿出3%用于支出已经是一笔巨款。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">despite the fact that we have saved a lot we have also used a lot and then we discussed that in Norway the typical argument is that yes we have used a lot but we were supposed to use a lot because we were facing in a lot over the But because the oil fund has grown so much, taking 3% out of the fund in spending has been a lot over the time.</p>
</details>

**Hilde C. Bjørnland：** 财政部长在上周的预算中指出，几年后，我们将看到政府部门的成本超过收入，这意味着未来从基金中提取3%可能不足以满足财政需求。因此，我们已经将自己置于这样一种境地：与其他经合组织国家相比，我们已经使用了大量资源，我们已经非常依赖基金的收入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and the minister of finance in their budget last week pointed out that in a few years we're going to see costs exceed revenues uh in the government sector and that means that maybe going forward the 3% from the fund will not be sufficient to finance that. So we have put ourselves in a situation where compared to other OCD countries we have already used a lot of the resources the we are already depending a lot on the income from the fund.</p>
</details>

**Hilde C. Bjørnland：** 我想向你们展示两个我认为存在的挑战，并且我认为在未来应对这些挑战至关重要，特别是如果我们要适应并减少对石油的依赖以建立其他产业。首先，尽管我们在80年代、90年代和21世纪初拥有高生产率水平和比许多国家更高的增长率，但现在挪威的生产率增长率相对于其他顶尖经合组织国家正在下降。挪威劳动力供应量高，但已停滞不前，而且我们的工作时间比许多经合组织国家少。最重要的是，劳动力之外的人口比例在增加。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what I'm going to uh show you here is uh two challenges which I think they're there and which uh I think are important to address going forward in particular if we are to uh adapt and uh reduce our dependence on oil to build other industry. The first is that despite having high productivity levels and higher growth rates in the 80s, 90s, early 20s than many countries, growth rates of productivity now are declining in Norway relative to other top OCD countries. Norway has a high labor supply, but we also have a high share um or so we have a high labor supply, but it has been stagnating and we also have we also work fewer hours than many OCD countries and most importantly we have an increase in share outside the labor force.</p>
</details>

**Hilde C. Bjørnland：** 我想以一个乐观的音符结束。我认为转型的结束不仅仅是挪威经济的成本问题，它同样带来了很多机会。新产业、新专利、新公司、新增长率、新合作伙伴、新讨论等等。但是，正如Nikolai Tangen今天早上所说，我们需要有雄心壮志才能实现这些目标。因此，我不会把我们的挑战藏在地毯下。相反，把它们拿出来，讨论该如何应对。

<details>

<p class="english-text">uh but I think that I want to end on an optimistic note. So I think that ended end of the transition is not just a matter of cost to Norwegian economy. It's a lot of opportunity as well. New industries, new patents, new um new firms, new growth rates, new partners, new new discussions, etc. But um we need as um Nicl Tang said this morning, we need u to have ambitions to achieve those goals. So brushing our challenges under the carpet is not something I do. Instead, put them up and discuss what to do about them.</p>

### 第三部分：主旨演讲与对话

#### Christine Lagarde：能源的三重困境与欧洲之路

**Christine Lagarde：** 在这个新环境下，许多国家面临着在三个能源目标之间日益艰难的权衡，我称之为我的“能源三重困境”。我的团队认为我不应该真的使用“三重困境”这个词，因为在困境中你无法真正逃脱，而我将试图向你们展示我们能够逃脱这个困境。那么，这个困境的三个角是什么呢？我们需要安全的能源，因为地缘政治现实已经发生了巨大变化。我们需要可持续的能源，因为气候现实没有改变，或者有人会说它变得更糟了。我们需要负担得起的能源，因为家庭和企业都需要它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In this new environment, many countries face an increasingly difficult tradeoff between three energy goals that I will call my energy trilmna. My team argues that I should not really use trilmna because in a trilmna you can't really escape and I'm going to try to show you that we can escape the trilmna. So what are the three angles of the trilmna? We need energy that is secure because the geopolitical reality has changed dramatically. We need energy that is sustainable because the climate reality has not changed or some would argue that it has changed for the worse. And we need energy that is affordable because households and corporates need it.</p>
</details>

**Christine Lagarde：** 最终，只有清洁能源有潜力实现我这个三重困境的所有三个目标。正如挪威实际展示的那样，这个国家可再生能源在能源消费中的份额位居世界前列。虽然家庭能源价格问题备受争议，但在政治竞选期间成为争议焦点，但请记住，它们仍约为欧盟平均水平的三分之二。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ultimately only clean energy has the potential to deliver on all three goals of my trilmna. As Norway actually demonstrates the share of renewable in energy consumption here in this country ranks amongst the highest in the world. While household energy prices, I know highly debated on the subject of controversy during the political campaign, but remember they are still around 23 of the EU average.</p>
</details>

**Christine Lagarde：** 欧洲要实现这些目标的唯一可行路径是更多地依赖本地清洁能源。这条路径可以帮助满足三重困境的三个目标。首先，可再生能源以及其他生产电力的清洁技术，是任何旨在减少气候变化影响的可靠计划的核心。其次，可再生能源提供了一定程度的能源独立性，考虑到我们自然资源的缺乏，欧洲通过进口化石燃料永远无法达到这种独立性。第三，由于可再生电力的边际成本接近于零，一个主要基于可再生能源的系统最终应该会降低能源价格。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The only viable path for Europe to achieve these objectives is to rely more on locally clean energy. This path could help meet the three goals of the trilmna. First, renewables alongside other clean technologies for producing electricity are central to any credible plan to reduce the impact of climate change. Second, renewables offer level of energy independence that given our lack of natural resources, Europe would never reach with imported fossil fuel. And third, as a marginal as the marginal cost of renewable electricity is close to zero, a system based largely on renewables should ultimately bring down energy prices.</p>
</details>

**Christine Lagarde：** 我乐观地认为欧洲能够克服这些挑战，原因有三。首先，虽然我们无法消除与间歇性相关的成本——我们无法控制天气——但如果我们推进发电能力、电网和储能方面的投资，我们可以大幅降低这些成本。其次，由于我们的地理多样性，基础设施投资在欧洲可能特别有效。第三，技术正朝着对我们有利的方向发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there are three reasons why I'm optimistic that Europe can overcome these challenges. First, while we cannot eliminate the cost associated with intermittency, we cannot control the weather. We can substantially reduce them if we push through with the investment in generation capacity, grids and storage. Second, infrastructure investment could be particularly effective in Europe owing to what? To our geographic diversity. Third element, the technology is moving in our favor.</p>
</details>

**Christine Lagarde：** 缺失的是什么？像往常一样，是钱。我们如何解锁投资？我认为，我们政策制定者——我这里指的是财政当局和货币当局——必须提供两样东西。首先，是正确的融资环境。我们认为，缺失的环节是一个功能完善的资本市场。深化和整合欧盟资本市场对于支持我们所需的大规模投资至关重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what is missing as usual? Money. How can we unlock the investment? But I think that we policy makers and I'm talking here about both fiscal authorities and monetary authorities. We must provide two things. First, the right environment for financing. So the missing link in our view is a proper functioning capital market. Deepening and integrating EU capital markets is critical to support the large-scale investments that we need.</p>
</details>

**Christine Lagarde：** 其次，政策制定者需要为投资创造一个可预测的环境。如果绿色转型被不确定性所笼罩，投资就不会向前推进。因此，我们必须在可能的情况下减少不确定性。创造合适的环境始于三个要素：信誉、速度和信心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Second policy makers need to create a predictable environment for investment. Investment will not step forward if the green transition is clouded by uncertainty. So we must reduce uncertainty where it is possible. So creating the right environment begins with well three elements again credibility, speed and confidence.</p>
</details>

#### Al Gore：可持续性转型的挑战与希望

**Al Gore：** 毫无疑问，我们正处于全球可持续性转型的关键时刻，它一直面临着巨大的阻力。但正如拉加德总统非常雄辩地指出的那样，这些阻力变得更强了，每个人都知道这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, there's no doubt that we're at a a critical moment in the global sustainability transition and it's always faced significant headwinds. But as uh uh President Lagarde has very eloquently said, those headwinds have become stronger and everybody knows it.</p>
</details>

**Al Gore：** 化石燃料行业在俘获政客方面的效率远高于其捕获排放的效率。结果，他们利用积累的政治权力进行反击，削弱了世界急需的进展。我们每天仍在向对流层排放1.75亿吨人为的全球变暖污染物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the fossil fuel industry is significantly more efficient at capturing politicians than capturing emissions. Uh and as a result, they have used the accumulated political power to push back and to blunt the progress that the world needs very seriously. We are continuing to put 175 million tons of man-made global warming pollution into the troposphere every day.</p>
</details>

**Al Gore：** 过去几年最令人充满希望和乐观的趋势之一是，例如去年，如果你看看全球各地安装的所有新发电设施，很多人会惊讶地听到，可再生能源所占的比例是93%。国际能源署预测，在未来几年，这一比例将超过95%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the most hopeful and optimistic trends of the last few years, last year for example, if you look at all of the new electricity generation installed worldwide everywhere in the world, many are surprised to hear that the percentage represented by renewable energy was 93%. And the International Energy Agency has projected that in the years ahead, it's going to exceed 95% renewable energy.</p>
</details>

**Al Gore：** 然而，资本的获取存在不平等的分配不均。经济学家称之为“本土偏好”。投资者和贷款人也不愿向发展中国家注入资本，因为那里存在货币突然贬值的显著风险，可能导致他们亏损。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, there is an unequal malistribution of access to capital. There is what the economists call a home bias. And there is also a reluctance on the part of investors and lenders to commit to capital in uh infusions into developing countries where there is a noticeable risk of currency valuation on a sudden basis which might cause them to lose their money.</p>
</details>

**Al Gore：** 以非洲为例。非洲拥有全世界60%的优质太阳能潜力，但非洲安装的太阳能电池板比美国佛罗里达一个州还少。这是对当前全球资本配置体系的可耻评论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Take Africa for example. Africa has 60% of the prime solar energy potential of the entire world. But Africa has fewer solar panels installed than the single US state of Florida. That is a disgraceful commentary on the current system for the allocation of capital around the world.</p>
</details>

**Al Gore：** 尽管此刻存在政治困难，我们不能让一个更美好世界的雄心在我们的注视下凋零。所以，请允许我引用挪威著名剧作家亨利克·易卜生的话来结束。在《建筑大师》中，他写道：“空中楼阁，它们是如此容易躲藏，也如此容易建造。”但我还想提醒大家另一段话，对我来说，它展示了我们的集体任务。他写道：“千言万语难留痕，一桩实事传后人。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, despite the political difficulties of the moment, we cannot let the ambition for a better world wither away on our watch. So, let me close by citing Norway's celebrated playwright Henrik Ipsson. In The Master Builder and the quote castles in the air. They are so easy to take refuge in and so easy to build, too. But I'd like to remind us of another passage which to me demonstrates our collective task from Mandon. He wrote, "A thousand words can't make the mark. A single deed will leave."</p>
</details>

**Al Gore：** 有些人认为我们唯一短缺的是政治意愿。但请永远记住，政治意愿本身就是一种可再生资源。谢谢。

<details>

<p class="english-text">The only thing some people think we have in short supply is political will. But please always remember that political will is itself a renewable resource. Thank you.</p>

### 第四部分：气候风险与投资机遇

#### Tim Lenton：气候的正负引爆点

**Tim Lenton：** 让我们从坏消息开始，气候系统中的一些引爆点。不幸的是，在气候系统中，触发一件事往往会使触发另一件事的可能性更大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, let's start with the bad news. the tipping points, some of the tipping points in the climate system. And tipping one thing unfortunately tends to make tipping another more likely in the climate system.</p>
</details>

**Tim Lenton：** 就在上周，我们发布了《2025年全球引爆点报告》，我们首次向世界宣告，我们已经跨过了一个气候引爆点。这就是热带暖水区珊瑚礁广泛白化死亡的引爆点。你可能会想，我为什么要关心这个？除了这是一个美丽的、生物多样性丰富的生态系统外，它还支撑着估计超过5亿人的生计，许多丰富的渔业，当然，珊瑚礁在一个海平面上升和风暴潮的世界里，为热带地区许多海岸线后的所有房地产提供了非常重要的海岸保护。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So just last week we launched our global tipping points report 2025 and we're saying to the world for the first time we've crossed a climate tipping point. This is the one for widespread dieback of coral reefs in the tropics in warm warm waters. Why should I care? You might be thinking. Apart from this is a beautiful biodiverse ecosystem but it does support the livelihoods of an estimated more than 500 million people, many rich fisheries and of course coral reefs provide really important coastal protection in a world of rising sea levels and storm surges to all of the real estate behind the reefs around many coastlines of the tropics.</p>
</details>

**Tim Lenton：** 我们不能排除格陵兰和西南极的冰盖实际上已经接近或可能已经越过了一个引爆点，这将导致长期海平面大幅上升。我们现在也知道，亚马逊雨林可能因全球变暖和人类持续砍伐的双重影响而面临风险，其风险出现的暖化程度比我们之前想象的要低。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we can't rule out that both are actually close to or possibly past a a tipping point. making a commitment to a very large magnitude of long-term sea level rise. We also know now that the Amazon rainforest could be at risk both from the combined effects of global warming and of people continuing to deforest it at a lower level of warming than we thought before.</p>
</details>

**Tim Lenton：** 我只想简单谈谈大西洋环流中的几个耦合引爆点。我们知道这东西可以被引爆。它在上一个冰河时期和上一个冰河时期结束时开关了25次。如果我们触发了**大西洋经向翻转环流**（Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, 简称AMOC）的崩溃会发生什么？嗯，在一些最先进的气候模型中，这在全球变暖2°C时发生。这会对西北欧产生巨大影响，并可能导致全球粮食不安全。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I just want to talk briefly about a couple of coupled tipping points in the Atlantic Ocean circulation which is kind of the Atlantic bit of this. Right. We know that this thing can be tipped off. It's switched on and off 25 times during the last ice age and the end of the last ice age. What happens if we tip the collapse of the Atlantic overturning circulation? Well, it happens in some of the state-of-the-art climate models at 2° C of global warming. It would make Northwest Europe less habitable. and could cause global food insecurity.</p>
</details>

**Tim Lenton：** 这就是为什么我花了好几年时间试图说服自己，并写了一本关于积极引爆点的书，书中列举了证据，表明在某些行业和市场，我们已经看到了向清洁技术的惊人积极引爆点，以及我们需要的行为改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Which is why I spent a couple of years trying to convince myself and write a book here on positive tipping points about the evidence that in some sectors and in some markets we have seen a spectacular positive tipping points to clean technology and also some changes in behavior that we need.</p>
</details>

**Tim Lenton：** 挪威在引领世界从内燃机汽车向电动汽车的引爆点上可以引以为豪。挪威引领世界，在市场上实现了从一种技术到另一种技术的非常突然的转变。然而，我们需要考虑全球图景，并再次提醒自己放大反馈的作用，因为虽然挪威市场的引爆需要政策支持，但在全球范围内，越多的电动汽车被采用，它们就会变得越好、越便宜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Norway can be rightly proud of having led the world in a very abrupt transition in the market from one to the other. However, we need to be thinking about the global picture here and we got to remind ourselves again of amplifying feedbacks because whilst it took the policy support to tip the Norwegian market in a global sense, the more electric vehicles that uh get adopted and there they are, that's the total fleet worldwide growing exponentially with a doubling time of a year and a half. um the better and the cheaper they get.</p>
</detais>

**Tim Lenton：** 我们的建模表明，我们现在正处于一个不可避免的或正在引爆的时期，太阳能将成为本世纪中叶的主要电力来源。我们都可以同意，我们仍然需要加快速度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Our modeling suggests that it's now we're now in an inevitable or tipping to solar p becoming the dominant source of electricity by midcentury. We pro we can all agree we need still need to go faster.</p>
</details>

**Tim Lenton：** 总结一下，现在满足《巴黎协定》以限制全球变暖的唯一途径，无论你如何定义“远低于2°C”，就是激活一些积极的引爆点，以加速我们需要的变革。但我试图向你们展示，在一些关键市场和行业，这已经发生了，而且我们对能够最有效地推动这些引爆点前提的政策和行动有所了解。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">To summarize, the only way now to meet the Paris agreement to limit warming, whatever you mean by well below two degrees C, is to activate some positive tipping points that accelerate the change we need. But I tried to show you that already that's happening in some key markets and sectors and we know something about the policies, the actions that can be most effective in bringing those tipping points forward.</p>
</details>

#### Laura Starks：气候信息在投资决策中的作用

**Laura Starks：** 在讨论这个问题之前，我认为我们必须思考动机，因为投资者采纳气候信息的动机各不相同，实际上可能差异很大。动机取决于投资者的视角。它可以是价值观视角，也可以是价值视角。价值观视角与非金钱、非财务因素有关，它关乎人们的价值观。而价值视角是我们思考投资者时的方式，他们做决策的依据是审视财务信息，思考利用气候信息所带来的风险和回报机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So before talking about that, I think we have to think about the motivations because the motivations for incorporating climate information vary across investors in fact can vary quite a bit. The motivations depend on the perspective of the investor. So it can be a values perspective, it can be a value perspective. and and when we when we think about the values perspective that has to do with non-puniary, non-financial, it's it's people's it's it's what they value. The value perspective is what we think about with investors. What they make their decisions based on is looking at the financial information thinking about how this the risk and return opportunities that come from using the climate information.</p>
</details>

**Laura Starks：** 我们对全球439家大型机构投资者进行了调查，询问他们为何将气候风险信息纳入投资决策。我们发现他们的选择多种多样。我们可以将这些动机分为价值观视角和价值视角。价值视角包括：投资回报有益、降低整体投资组合风险、降低尾部风险。另一方面，价值观动机则关注：资产所有者的偏好是什么？这是否是一种道德伦理义务？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We surveyed um 439 large institutional investors around the world asking them why they incorporated climate risk information into their investment decisions. And we found quite a bit of variety in what they chose. And we can separate these into values versus value perspectives. So if we think about the value perspective, it's um uh you know what are what are the uh return opportunities? It's it's beneficial to investment return. Um it reduces overall portfolio risk. It reduces tail risk. On the other hand, there are values motivations where they're looking at um is you know what are the asset owner's preferences? Is it a moral ethical obligation?</p>
</details>

**Laura Starks：** 长期机构投资者应该是对他们所投资公司的环境、社会和治理（ESG）政策最感兴趣的群体。这张图显示，持有期最长的投资者确实持有ESG评分高的公司，而持有期短的投资者则不然，这种关系非常单调。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">long-term institutional investors should be the ones most interested in the environmental, social and governance policies of their uh invest investy firms. And as you can see, it was really clear that it's those with the long-term horizon that that are are um holding the high ESG firms and you know the E one of the big things in there is climate change and then um and then the shortterm horizon and it you know it was very monotonic um in terms of how this how this came out.</p>
</details>

**Laura Starks：** 《巴黎协定》签署后发生了什么？监管风险预计会上升。我们研究了那些受碳排放影响最大的公司的债券价格变化和信用评级分析师的评级变化。我们发现，在《巴黎协定》之后，这些公司的信用评级大幅下降。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what happened when the Paris agreement was signed? The the regulatory risk would be expected to go up. So we looked at price changes uh for those bonds and we also looked at at the credit rating analyst changes in uh credit ratings and we found that and and so this blue line shows what happened to the credit ratings where this red line in the middle is the uh the month of the of the Paris agreement. And as you can see there there was basically no difference before the Paris agreement in terms of um the the um the credit ratings and then after the Paris agreement there was a big drop in credit ratings for those firms that were most exposed to carbon emissions.</p>
</details>

**Laura Starks：** 为了获取公司所需的气候信息，需要有充分的披露。我们询问投资者，他们认为气候风险披露与常规财务报告相比有多重要。79%的受访者认为它至少与财务报告同等重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">in order to get the information that's needed on the the the climate information about a company, there needs to be adequate disclosure. So, we ask how important do you think climate risk disclosure is compared to reporting on financial information? 79% believed that it was at least as important as financial reporting.</p>
</details>

**Laura Starks：** 强制性气候风险披露有两个目标。第一个目标通常被称为“单一重要性”，即获取信息以了解气候风险如何影响公司及其风险。第二个目标可称为“双重重要性”，即不仅要了解它如何影响公司及其风险，还要了解公司的行为如何影响社会和环境。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if you think about mandatory climate risk disclosure there there can be two goals. The first goal is often called single materiality and it's you know it's to get the information in order to understand how climate risk is affecting the firm and its risk. The second goal which is can be called double materiality is not only how does it affect the firm and its risk but how is this impacting um the firm's actions are affecting society and the environment.</p>
</details>

**Laura Starks：** 投资者利用气候信息与公司进行沟通，试图让公司在气候变化方面更加负责。我们发现，在我们调查的投资者中，84%的人通过各种方式与公司沟通，试图获取更多气候信息并促使他们更加负责。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um they the investors are are um using the climate information to engage with the firms to try to to get the firms to be more responsible when it comes to climate change. So 84% of the um investors that we surveyed are engaging the firms in various ways to try to get more climate information and to get them to be more responsible.</p>
</details>

#### Harrison Hong：气候投资的风险与回报

**Harrison Hong：** 我将从投资组合多元化的视角来探讨这个问题，并提出一个更广泛的问题。对于可再生能源、基于自然的解决方案和适应性资本这些不同类型的资产，我们认为它们的风险特征是什么？基本思想是，社会希望实现某种程度的投资组合多元化，风险越高的资产，你越不倾向于投资，或者反过来说，政府需要做更多的工作来财政支持，以激励社会采纳这些资产。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I'm going to take this portfolio diversification lens but I'm going to ask kind of a broader question. I'm going to ask look you know for these different types of assets like renewables, nature-based solutions and adaptation capital right I'm going to focus on second moments right what do we think are the risk characteristics of these different types of capital right on the basic idea that societyy's going to want some portfolio diversification and the more risky it is the less you're going to want to tilt towards it or the other way of saying is government has to do more to fiscalize right uh to incentivize then society to kind of adopt these assets.</p>
</details>

**Harrison Hong：** 我认为，克里斯蒂娜·拉加德的演讲恰到好处地指出了这一点。她花了很多时间谈论二阶效应，即风险。我认为这正是我们需要正视的核心问题，即可再生能源的二阶效应，这一点在很大程度上被忽视了。例如，德国曾出现历史性的风力不足，导致其大量可再生能源公司濒临破产。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I think what hasn't been discussed as much uh is really kind of these second moment effects. And I think Christine nailed it on the head. You know, she spent an enormous amount of time talking about second moment effects, right? I think this is exactly kind of a front and center the transparent issues that we need to kind of confront which is the second moment effects which I think has been mostly like neglected. there was this kind of historic lack of wind and you know their economy was a lot of was kind of built on this wind power. So during this episode where year on year there was this massive drop in in in in wind in in in Germany um a substantial fraction of their renewable companies kind of basically teetered on a bankruptcy.</p>
</details>

**Harrison Hong：** 同样，对于基于自然的解决方案，比如森林，其资产的波动性历来要高得多。森林非常容易受到火灾的影响。你可能试图用一片森林来进行碳封存，但如果发生火灾，整个项目就付之一炬。所以，投资于大自然本身也带有其固有的风险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So for naturebased solutions you know think about the asset class right that would basically mean forest is is one big part of the naturebased solutions. And what you see with forest is that uh uh the volatility of forest assets are historically substantially higher. So that is to say, you know, if we think that we're suddenly going to have all these voluntary carbon markets and then people are going to turn forest into these like carbon credits, one big issue will be that 10 to 12% ball. you know forests are very susceptible to fires right you know you can kind of have a forest to try to do all of this uh hh sequestration but then what if you get kind of this fire and then the whole thing burns down okay so not so simple right so these types of risk investing in mother nature that is to say also has its own risk.</p>
</details>

**Harrison Hong：** 即使绿色资本与化石燃料具有相同的生产率，并且绿色资本本身带来的气候灾害较少，但仅仅因为多元化的需要，要实现100%的绿色经济仍可能面临重大障碍或阻力。让投资者走完最后一英里是非常昂贵的。如果一个投资者已经在其投资组合中持有30%的绿色资产，要让他增加到50%或60%是非常昂贵的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, you could still have the case that you could have significant impediments or headwinds toward a 100% green economy purely because of diversification. Yeah, it's very expensive to get the investor to go the last mile. If the person's already owning 30% green assets in his portfolio, making that investor go to 50% 60% is very expensive.</p>
</details>

**Harrison Hong：** 我们的因果证据表明，波动性渠道对投资者非常重要。当公司被迫使用20%到30%的可再生能源发电时，你会发现电价的波动性上升了。这些绿色资产产生的现金流更加不稳定。当这些公司试图为这些绿色资产投资筹集债务时，它们基本上要面临更高的资本成本。投资者认为可再生能源的波动性大约是化石燃料的1.5倍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So this is some causal evidence that says that you know uh which we attribute to intermittency risk. when you're forcing these companies now to suddenly produce their power with 20% 30% using renewables. What you see is that the volatility of electricity prices goes up. Okay. So that is these green assets are generating cash flows that are more volatile, right? So when these firms then go and try to raise debt to make these investments into this these green assets uh they basically face like a higher cost of capital. It basically means that investors view renewables as something on the order of 1.5 times more volatile than fossil fuels.</p>
</details>

**Harrison Hong：** 讨论得还远远不够的是适应性资本。鉴于基础设施的年波动率仅为7%到9%，我们不仅应该讨论可再生能源与棕色能源，还应该将适应性资本作为第三种资本配置来源。换句话说，我们的投资组合中应该拥有多少适应性资本？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the last five minutes I'll talk about this which is that I think much underd discussed is is then of course you know adaptation capital right. Um given that infrastructure is only a 7 to 9% ball annual, we should also discuss not only renewables brown, but really adaptation capital as the third source of capital allocation, right? In other words, like how much adaptation capital do we want to own in our portfolio?</p>
</details>

**Harrison Hong：** 思考适应性资本的方式是，它实际上是一种保险。我把房子建在高跷上，不是因为我喜欢高跷，而是为了对冲自然界的坏运气。这些是经济中的对冲资产。从长期来看，如果气候科学是正确的，适应性资本的回报可能会相当高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, which is if you think about adaptation capital really it's kind of insurance, right? uh kind of the way to think about adaptation capital is that look you know I'm building my house on stilts not because I love stilts but basically it's it's kind of a hedge against you know bad draws of nature right. these are hedge assets right in the economy and the question is how much of these hedge assets do we want to own uh globally. is probably going to have pretty high returns if the climate science is right.</p>

### 闭幕总结：挑战、机遇与前行之路

**Carina Smith：** 我最近当了祖母。当我的孙女25岁时，那将是2050年，也就是我们力争实现净零排放的年份。她将继承一个怎样的世界？气候变化将如何影响全球经济和她的未来？正如我们今天上午从行长那里听到的，气候变化影响着挪威银行的所有核心任务。
