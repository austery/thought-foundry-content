### 财政状况与赤字目标

主持人欢迎**斯科特·贝森特**回到All-In播客，感谢他抽出时间回顾执政第一年，并讨论美国政府的财政状况、美国经济的经济状况（包括华尔街和普通民众的情况），以及政府政策和决策的实施情况。主持人首先提及上次对话中，贝森特曾提出将预算赤字降至**GDP**（Gross Domestic Product: 国内生产总值，衡量一国经济产出的总值）3%以下的目标，并询问目前的进展以及对2026财年的展望。贝森特表示，2025年是“为未来铺垫”的一年，而2026年将是“盛宴”之年。尽管在政府停摆期间公布，美国在2025财年实现了轻微的财政紧缩，赤字从预估的2万亿美元降至1.78万亿美元，远好于预期。他指出，**拜登政府**在2024年第四季度为了副总统**哈里斯**的选举，支出了40%的政府预算。贝森特预测，本日历年将实现约2000亿至3000亿美元的财政紧缩，相当于GDP的0.7%至1%。随着名义增长接近6%，赤字占GDP的比例将从去年的峰值6.8%-8%降至5.5%左右。他相信，在**特朗普总统**离任时，赤字占GDP的比例将稳定在3%左右，从而实现债务偿还。

Secretary Bessant, welcome back to All-In. We appreciate you taking the time to catch up with us and provide this first year in review. We're excited to have you here and hear how things are going and what's ahead regarding the fiscal condition of the US government, the economic condition of the US economy, including how things are going for Wall Street and Main Street. And finally, we'd like to broadly discuss some of the administration's policies, decisions, and how they're playing out or will play out from your point of view. I'll start us off and maybe to catch up on our last conversation. One of the things that I've cared deeply about and which you shared an objective around is getting the budget deficit below 3% of GDP. I'd love to hear uh from your point of view how that's going and how things are looking for fiscal year 26. the actions that have been taken and what you think's ahead for that target.

>> Good to be with you. Happy to review the year, talk about next year. Uh there's a lot going on. I would c categorize 2025. We had some important victories, some important policy announcements, uh some important movement, but I as I've described it, 2025 was setting the table. And I especially on the economy, I think the the feast and the banquet's going to be in 2026. To start with the budget deficit, we didn't get much credit because it came out during the shutdown. The the US fiscal year is on September 30th. We had a slight fiscal contraction for the year. Wasn't much, but much better than the 2.0 trillion that was estimated. We came down from about 1.8 trillion to 1.78. So, a a contraction nonetheless for the calendar year. We're making great progress. And just to put it in context, Biden administration, they blew things out try trying to get Vice President Harris elected in the fourth quarter. So last year 2024 40% of the government spending occurred in the fourth quarter as they had the un uh successful or their unsuccessful attempt to convince voters that they uh weren't in a world of hurt. I forecast that we will have approximately a 200 to 300 billion fiscal contraction uh for the calendar year which is between 7 1% of GDP. We're going to end the year with nominal growth close to 6%. So we will be bringing down the deficit to GDP. I believe it peaked 6.8% 8% for the calendar year previous year and we're going to be in the mid-5s. So, it's a very good start on an important journey and I've said that I would by the time President Trump leaves office that we would like to uh have something with a three in front of it which will stabilize the deficit to GDP which is the important number and enable us to start paying down debt.

### 关税政策的积极影响与误解

主持人询问关税政策带来的巨大积极影响，以及为何许多人对此判断失误。贝森特认为，人们缺乏开放的心态，将关税政策直接与“**特朗普**关税”挂钩，导致许多政府官员、行业人士和普通民众因其与特朗普相关而立即持负面看法。他打趣说，这就像“特朗普治愈了癌症却导致了头皮屑”，人们就会抱怨“特朗普引发了头皮屑流行病”。他批评了许多未能奏效的传统经济学正统观念，例如21世纪初让中国加入全球贸易体系，期望其变得更像西方。然而，自2013年**习近平**上任以来，情况发生了变化，中国政策回到了“强硬共产主义、列宁主义”。贝森特认为，这是一种“想象力的失败”。他提到，1990年代的**美联储**主席**艾伦·格林斯潘**（Alan Greenspan）之所以表现出色，正是因为他抱有开放的心态，相信互联网和办公现代化将为美国经济带来生产力红利，从而实现了经济的蓬勃发展和大量债务的偿还。他还引用了**旧金山联储**一项基于150年数据的研究，该研究表明关税并不会导致通货膨胀，反而具有**反通胀**（Disinflationary: 指通货膨胀率下降，但仍为正值，物价仍在上涨，只是上涨速度放缓）作用。

Scott, it seems like the tariffs have had an enormously positive impact. It's given you a lot of tools in the toolbox to work with. Why do you think so many people got it wrong? A lot of people, I'm sure, that you've known and worked with in your prior life as a hedge fund manager. What did they get wrong? What did they miss that you were able to see?

>> Well, I I a couple of things. I I think people didn't have an open mind. Uh they became the Trump tariffs which immediately a large cohort. Uh whether it was government officials, industry people, the general population because President Trump wanted to do it, it must be bad. I I said the other day, President Trump cured cancer but it caused dandruff. Then people would say, well, you know, President Trump has caused a dandruff epidemic. And um look that there's a lot of orthodoxy that hasn't worked. If we look back early early 2000s letting China into the global trading system that they would become more like us and there was a point and I'm somewhat sympathetic to the people who believe that but by 2013 when Xiinping came in and great writers like Elizabeth economy who had been of that view reversed and said he's a different kind of cat. It's no longer going to be Chinese policies with capitalist tendencies. It's just going to go back to, you know, hard communism, Leninism. And I I just think that it was a failure of imagination. I I've said several times people and maybe we'll talk about it today when people ask me, "What are you looking for in a Fed chair?" Said, "It's someone with an open mind." If we go back to the 1990s, Alan Greenspan did a magnificent job because he had an open mind that the internet office modernization boom was going to create a productivity bonanza for the US economy. And he let the economy he let it rip. And we had an incredible economy paid down a tremendous amount of debt that by 1998 1999 with a combination of Clinton administration having gotten religion new Gingrich and his policies there was talk the at the end of the 90s that there might not be enough government debt to you meet the needs of the financial system which is the opposite of what we have Now, so again, I I would uh part of it was just anything the president does must be wrong. Part of it was a failure of imagination. And you know, there there's some very good studies coming out now that are showing why why everyone has been wrong that the the measurement problems the on the increase in goods prices. There's a study from not a friend of the administration, the San Francisco Fed with 150 years of data, I would refer everyone to that that shows that tariffs do not cause inflation, that they're actually disinflationary.

### 关税的国家安全考量与中国商业模式

主持人询问，在利用关税来减轻经济税负和作为联邦政府增加收入以减少赤字之间，如何取得平衡。贝森特指出关税政策成功的两个主要原因。首先是**国家安全**考量，**特朗普总统**将关税作为国家安全政策的一部分，用于贸易谈判。例如，对墨西哥征收**芬太尼**（Fentanyl: 一种强效合成阿片类药物，常用于止痛，但也存在滥用风险）关税，促使墨西哥政府与美国合作打击毒品；对中国稀土出口许可证威胁征收100%关税，也立即促使中方回到谈判桌。其次，贝森特认为人们忽略了中国的商业模式是基于**产量、就业和五年计划**。他坚信，即便征收关税，中国仍会继续生产，因为他们可能在每件产品上亏损一美元，但会通过巨大的销量来弥补。关于关税收入的预测，贝森特表示，关税的最终目标是平衡贸易和**制造业回流**（Reshore Manufacturing: 将海外生产线或业务迁回本国），而非仅仅是收入。随着时间的推移，关税收入会下降，而美国工厂就业和制造业的增加将带来更高的工资税收，从而提高美国税收。他强调，在1980年代，人们关注的是美国本土制造了多少产品，因为美国以外制造的一切都会减少美国GDP。因此，制造业回流将加速GDP增长。

So, has anybody read that study? Scott, has that been, I would say, a part of the conversation in the administration now that there's this new revenue stream for the federal government, there's an opportunity to cut taxes and cut other sources of revenue for the federal government and that could potentially accelerate the economy. But balancing that question against the importance of cutting the deficit, how do you think about the balance between using tariffs as a mechanism for reducing the tax burden on the economy versus using the tariffs as an incremental revenue source for the federal government to start to reduce the deficit and pay down the debt eventually? David, before I answer that, another thing I want to go back to is President Trump and one one of the reasons for the success of the tariff policy or I I'll give you two reasons. One is that President Trump has used them for national security. So the tariff policy has become part of national security who's able to use the tariffs to negotiate trade deals. when he ratcheted up some of the tariff levels to 35 49 50% even 145 with the Chinese it brings people to the table in uh the spring the president put fentanyl tariffs on Mexico they've all come to the table to help and partner with the US government to end this scourge on our people we're seeing fentanyl deaths drop We because of the the good efforts of China, we made a good faith move and decreased their fentanyl tariffs by half down to 10%. So that's been national security. Same thing on October 8th when Beijing announced that they were going to put a worldwide export license on any any product that had 01% of Chinese rare earths in it, which would have ground the Western trading system to a halt. President Trump was able to threaten a 100% tariff and the Chinese immediately came to the table. The the other thing that I would say so so that's all national security. The other thing that I would say that people missed that I was convinced of is that the Chinese business model is based on volume. It's based on employment. It's based on a 5-year plan. And I I think everyone neglected the idea that despite the t the tariffs, the Chinese were going to keep producing that it it's one of these they may lose a dollar on every product, but they make up for it in volume. Can we forecast these tariffs through 28 or do you think that we have to have moments where whether it's the Supreme Court who's opining on one body of language versus another may change your course? But do you feel confident that we can forecast these revenues now out through the balance of President Trump's term?

>> Well, I I think the I think the revenues are are a combination of revenues. So the the ultimate goal of tariffs the the revenue collection I think but of in a way is a payback for the imbalances that have gone on over the years. But over time the the real idea is to balance trade and reshore manufacturing and bring our economy into balance with our trading partners. So what should happen is over time tariff income will come down and US tax receipts will come up whether it's from factory jobs or more manufacturing and through higher payroll taxes. So you we will we will start off at this very high level then we will rebalance and come up. So I I I think it's difficult to know the timing. We know the direction. We know the destination, but the the timing is difficult on terrorists versus increased domestic tax revenues. What what I can say is when when I got into the investment business in the 1980s, there was always a focus the on trade and how much were we making in the US and again that everything made outside of the US is a decrease in US GDP. So, as we bring it back, I think we're going to start looking more at the the content of trade versus domestic manufacturing as a component of GDP acceleration.

### 最高法院裁决与关税权力

主持人询问即将于明年1月公布的**最高法院**裁决，如果结果对政府不利，将会发生什么。贝森特认为，这将不仅是对政府的打击，更是对美国人民和国家安全的打击。他强调，关税收入并非核心，因为收入可以被其他方式取代，但**特朗普总统**利用关税在国家安全方面所做的一切将受到威胁。主持人质疑为何不与**国会**合作，因为根据宪法，国会似乎拥有关税权力。贝森特对此表示疑问，并解释总统根据《**国际紧急经济权力法**》（International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 简称**IEPA**）拥有颁发许可证的权利。他回忆了自己旁听最高法院听证会的经历，并指出**卡根大法官**（Justice Kagan）的卓越才智和**阿利托大法官**（Justice Alito）的雄辩。他提到，在一次质询中，大法官问道：“你是在告诉本法院，美国总统可以实施100%的禁运，但不能征收1%的关税吗？”原告对此表示肯定。贝森特预计裁决将更为细致，而非简单的“支持/反对”。他引用**艾米·科尼·巴雷特大法官**（Justice Amy Coney Barrett）的评论，即“如果我们撤销它，那将是一团糟”，这表明她倾向于寻找不撤销的理由，因为这可能涉及退款问题。他强调，行政部门通过**301条款**、**230 32条款**和**122条款**拥有征收贸易收入的绝对权力，使用IEPA并非滥用职权。

>> As we wrap tariffs, we have a Supreme Court ruling coming in January. What happens if that goes against the administration?

>> Well, I I don't think it's against the administration. And I actually think it's against the American people and it it will be again as I said it it will be a hit to national security and the the the revenues aren't the the focus here. The revenues aren't the focus. The the the revenues can be replaced but all all the things that President Trump has been able to do using tariffs on the national security side will be will be jeopardized.

>> Would you be able to just work with Congress on them? seems to how the constit see seems to be how the constitution was designed is that the congress would have this authority. So why not just work with them? Is that the fallback plan?

>> What why would you say congress would have what authority?

>> Well the constitution has tariff control. So that's at least my understanding of the US constitution and I think that's why there's a supreme court case. Correct. Uh well the we we'll see uh the the president has has the right under AIPA the for licenses we've also seen um it it was I I was at the Supreme Court and for for your viewers a bucket list event should be going to see a Supreme Court hearing. It it it it is in terms of any institution that is the closest to what our framers designed and kind of jumped into business in 1789. It is probably it is surely the closest to what you would have seen at the court. They're very convivial with each other.

>> Yeah. I listen to it. It's quite compelling content. Yeah.

>> Yeah. It's it's and to to be there in person uh not not my political leanings but ju justice Kagan the was just an intellect of towering uh impressiveness. I came away thinking I am glad that Justice Alto is not my father because he he he he is smart. He is bombastic and when when he he got the knife into a couple of the plaintiffs in a line of questioning and he uh move moves it around quite a bit. So, um, but one one line of questioning in in this that one one of the plaintiffs agreed on was so and it was either from Justice Alita or Justice Kavanagh was you were telling this court that the president of the United States can do 100% embargo but he cannot put on a 1% tariff and the plaintiff said yes.

>> Yeah. And that ruling is coming out in a few months. It's

>> January or February expectation. Yeah.

>> January, February. And Jason, to your question, u I I I don't know what the ruling is going to be. My my guess is everyone, you know, I I think that framing is very important in any issue. And I think the framing thus far has been very poor because it's viewed as 01. It's up down. And I my guess is it will be more nuanced. having been in the room for instance I I think uh many in the media were at a different hearing than I was at. So when Justice uh Barrett Comey Barrett said if we undo this it'll be a mess that was viewed as just it will be a mess as opposed to I believe she was actually leaning toward looking for a reason not to undo it because it would the refund she was referring to the refunds the president has absolute ability or the executive branch has absolute ability through 301's 230 32s and something called 122s to raise revenue on trade. So using the IEPA is not a stretch of that authority.

### 普通民众的不满与可负担性问题

主持人指出，尽管华尔街和科技行业对第一年的经济成果非常满意，但普通民众对**特朗普政府**第一年的表现却特别不满，尤其是在通胀（净支持率下降约30%）和经济（净负18%）这两个关键问题上。他询问，是美国人民的看法有误，还是**特朗普总统**在选举期间设定的期望过高，亦或是政府需要更多时间来执行政策。贝森特认为，答案是“需要更多时间”，因为政府“继承了一个烂摊子”，并预计2026年对美国人民和普通民众来说将是非常好的一年。他批评**拜登政府**和一些评论员（如《**华尔街日报**》的**格雷格**、**保罗·克鲁格曼**和前**美联储**副主席**艾伦·布林德**）试图告诉民众“你们不懂自己有多好”。贝森特承认美国人民正遭受物价高企的困扰，**拜登政府**执政期间累计**消费者物价指数**（Consumer Price Index, 简称**CPI**: 衡量消费者购买商品和服务价格变化的指标）上涨了21-22%。他引用**Strategus Research**公司的“**普通人指数**”（Common Man Index），该指数涵盖了工薪家庭必需品（汽油、保险、二手车、租金、日用品），显示这些商品价格上涨了约35%。他指出，通胀正在下降，可负担性包含两部分：控制物价和提高实际收入。汽油和石油价格大幅下降，租金也因移民返乡而下降了约5%（**沃顿商学院**研究显示，城市人口每增加1%会导致租金上涨1%）。他相信这种趋势将继续，通胀数据将持续回落，而实际收入也正在加速增长，自**特朗普总统**上任以来已上涨约1.8%。

>> Okay. So I I think the question and I really appreciate the introspection here on year one and the optimism for year two. Wall Street, the tech industry, we've absolutely loved the results in year one. My portfolio has surged. So that's fantastic. Thank you. probably beyond my expectation, but Main Street is particularly displeased with the Trump administration's first year. Your net approval rating is the lowest on two key issues. Inflation net approval rating down about 30% uh on average since the summer and on the economy 18% net negative. And so this is quite paradoxical obviously since Trump was elected and considered historically very strong on those two specific issues. So my question to you is, are the American people wrong? Or maybe did President Trump set expectations too high during the election or do you just need more time to execute and you're asking the American people humbly to give you more time?

>> Well, I I I think it's C because as Vice President Vance has said, we didn't get here overnight. We inherited a mess. And I think 2026 is going to be a a very good year for the American people for Main Street. And what we are not going to do is a which is what the Biden administration did and many commentators whether it was Greg in the Wall Street Journal, the toxic Paul Krugman who I seems to have been booted from the New York Times and is relegated to Substack or the former vice chair of the Fed uh Alan Blinder. And they said, "Oh, no. You don't understand how good you have it. You know, eat eat your drink your grog, have your bread, peasants. Um, we we'll give you a little more that you It's a vibe session. And we're going to explain to you why you have it really good. We understand that the American people are hurting. And I think the way to think about it is there's a price level that things appreciated to during the Biden administration. And then there is the inflation level. The price level has gotten very high. Uh I think cumulative CPI during the Biden administration was 21 22%. There's a Wall Street firm called Strategus Research. They do something called the common man index and it it is what do working families need? gasoline insurance, the uh autos, mostly used cars, rent, staples, and that appreciated by about 35%. So, people are seething over the high price level. And you as we saw in the inflation print this week, inflation is starting to turn down. And affordabil affordability is two parts. It is getting the price is under control. Some things we can decrease. Gasoline is coming down substantially. I would expect that it would come down much more. Oil. Oil is down substantially. Gasoline follows it with a lag. Uh rents are down and we are now seeing uh the effects of what 10 to 20 million undocumented people coming into the country did for rents. that this mass unfettered immigration for D and C rent levels was through the roof. There there's a study from Wharton that shows that one 1% of population increase in in a city leads to 1% rent. So, you know, we can see why rent went up that if the migrants are going home, we are now seeing rents are down about 5%. I think that trend will continue. Again, the inflation numbers are starting to roll down. I think that they will. And then the other side is real incomes, which I think are starting to accelerate. Real incomes are about up about 1.8% since President Trump took office. And that's back to the Main Street question.

### 劳工统计局数据与通胀衡量

主持人就**劳工统计局**（Bureau of Labor Statistics, 简称**BLS**: 美国劳工部下属机构，负责收集、分析和发布劳工经济数据）10月份的数据提出质疑，担心其中非调查数据源的零值可能导致数字过于乐观，并询问这些数据是否值得信任。贝森特回应称，当出现好数据时，华尔街的预测者们往往会因预测失误而归咎于衡量方法和数据本身。他指出，任何数据中都存在大量推算数据，这也是数据会进行修正的原因。他观察到，租金（即业主自住租金）和能源/汽油（价格明显下降）这两个下降最快的指标，在当月实际上有所上涨。他认为这些数据相当准确。贝森特团队的分析也通过插值和其他数据点证实了这些数字，甚至在某些方面略好。他还提到了**美联储理事史蒂文·迈伦**（Steven Myron）在哥伦比亚大学的演讲，其中提出了关于通胀衡量的一些有趣观点。例如，通胀构成中的金融服务部分会随着股市上涨而上升，即使投资组合管理成本实际上在下降，这反而显示出成本的增加。他认为，可以进行许多调整来提供更准确的经济图景。

>> So, just one quick followup there and I'll give it back to my compatriots. We need more time. This is not a one-year project. It's going to take two or three years and we're not going to gaslight you and the numbers are looking good. On that note, we had the shutdown October numbers were not complete. There's a bunch of reports now uh and hand ringing over those numbers. I think maybe you could address it, which is the BLS filled in a lot of the non-servey data sources with some zeros. Uh and potentially the criticism now or the concern on Wall Street and from analysts is that maybe this 2.7 number is over optimistic. maybe you could address people's concerns and can we trust you with the numbers I think is what Wall Street saying.

>> Uh well, you know, again, it it's amazing when a good number comes out, then it switches to that. And Jason, just let me tell you, every every Wall Street predictor on Bloomberg was wrong. So, what do you do when you're wrong? You blame the measurement. You blame the the data. And there there's always a lot of imputed data the in any of these numbers. That's why we get revisions. And I I'm looking at I was looking at the numbers and paradoxically the two things that I think are coming down the fastest which are rent uh also it's known as the owner owner occupied uh funding or owner occupied rent. Uh that was actually up on the month. I believe it is uh turned negative. And then the other thing that was up was energy and gasoline which we can is an observable event that those prices have decreased substantially uh from September October. So I I actually think it was a a pretty uh accurate number.

>> So you've checked into that the BLS numbers from October. You feel confident they they put those placeholders. They put those assumptions in correctly. You feel confident in that? Look, the the the BLS is problematic. We we've seen that the whole time. I have no reason to believe that this is any less robust than any other data series. And I I would say with with rent, with uh energy that those are very large components that have turned down substantially that actually recorded a gain for that measurement period. Just to build on that, we had people on our team go and run our own analysis both using interpolation and other data points and we get to exactly Scott's numbers and frankly on on the margin sometimes slightly better. So I think the trend is very much what you and Kevin Hasset have been talking about in the last couple days. And gentlemen, I would also point you to Fed Governor Steven Myron, who came came from CEA, he'll be going back to CA probably in February or March, delivered a very robust uh speech at Colombia. It was either a week or two ago and he made some very interesting measurement points on inflation. So one one piece of the inflation component there is financial services and that goes up based on whether the stock market's up.

>> That's right.

>> When in fact portfolio management costs have come down that it is showing an increase in cost. So that back to Jason's question on BL BLS uh how how robust are the numbers? I I think there are a lot of changes that could be adjusted to give us a better picture.

### 美联储的历史与量化宽松政策

主持人请贝森特回顾**美联储**的历史背景，并将其成立之初与当今的运作方式进行对比，特别是其对不平等的影响。贝森特解释说，美联储成立于**1913年**，是为了应对**1907年恐慌**（Knickerbocker Crisis: 又称“尼克伯克危机”，一场严重的金融危机，导致银行倒闭和经济衰退），那次危机比**1929年大萧条**（Crash of '29: 指1929年美国股市崩盘，引发全球经济大萧条）还要严重。在美联储成立之前，**J.P.摩根**（J.P. Morgan: 美国著名银行家和金融家，摩根大通的创始人）曾亲自介入危机。因此，人们认为政府需要一个机制来清算或提供流动性。在大部分历史中，**美国财政部**在美联储的决策中都占有一席之地，直到二战后才停止。在**2008年全球金融危机**（Great Financial Crisis, 简称**GFC**: 2008年爆发的全球性金融危机）之后，经济陷入瘫痪。贝森特认为，导致这种局面的一个重要原因是危机后出台的“考虑不周的危机立法”，他目前在财政部通过**金融稳定监督委员会**（Financial Stability Oversight Council: 旨在识别和应对金融系统风险的美国政府机构）的监管议程，正在着手废除这些立法。他指出，金融危机后，监管往往从不足走向过度。在GFC后的十年里，过度受限的监管体制使得美联储成为“唯一的救星”。他举例说，2006年一套价值50万美元的佛罗里达州北部房屋，后来跌至15万美元。尽管价格变得可负担，但新的金融法规和对银行不当行为的惩罚（尽管有些是合理的）导致银行缺乏在市场底部提供信贷的动力。结果是，有钱的资产所有者得以积累资产，而**奥巴马政府**期间经济增长缓慢，美联储长期保持低利率。

美联储在2009年3月启动了**量化宽松**（Quantitative Easing, 简称**QE**: 中央银行通过购买政府债券或其他金融资产向市场注入流动性的非常规货币政策）或大规模资产购买。其理论是创造流动性，从市场中移除长期安全资产，然后获得资金的人会购买风险更高的资产。**本·伯南克**（Ben Bernanke: 曾任美联储主席，因应对2008年金融危机而闻名）曾明确表示，QE的目的是让人们“去购买股票”。但并非所有人都能购买股票，这导致了“两级经济”：有资产者和无资产者。美联储将QE维持了过长时间，贝森特称其为“**不平等的引擎**”。他承认，促进经济平等并非美联储的职责，但他们不应加剧这种不平等，而他们恰恰是造成不平等的主要原因。他推荐了**凯伦·佩德鲁**（Karen Petrou）的著作《**美联储：不平等引擎**》。在**新冠疫情**期间，市场陷入混乱，美联储采取了正确的行动来稳定市场，但却不必要地将QE延续到了2023年2月或3月，实质上为同期7万亿美元的巨额债务增长提供了资金。贝森特总结道，中央银行已深度介入经济，许多人尚未完全理解，美联储已从简单的利率设定机制演变为一个“三头怪兽”，其复杂的运作（利率政策、资产负债表政策和监管政策）连他自己也无法完全理解。

Let's stay on the affordability topic and I would like to go to this essay you wrote which is uh incredible the Fed's new gain of function monetary policy which you wrote in the international economy. We'll link to this article. A lot of it goes to how the Fed in many ways has exacerbated the sense of inequality and the actual factual inequality. But before I ask you that narrow question, Scott, can you help our viewers just take a step back and give us a little bit of historical context on the Fed itself? So, we had a central bank in the 1700s, in the 1800s. Andrew Jackson got rid of it. It came back in the early 1900s. when we established it then versus what it's doing today and you've studied this carefully. Can you help us understand and contrast and compare how it started versus how it's going?

>> Sure. So, Fed was created in 1913 as a response to the panic of 1907 which people most people don't know about. It made the crash of 29 look like a day at the beach.

>> Nickerbacher crisis. Yeah,

>> the necrobacher crisis and just the a domino effect within the financial system there there was no central bank. Bank of England is a very old central bank and had been functioning well. uh JP Morgan actually had to personally step in uh in in the crisis and it it was deemed that there should be a mechanism for the the government to be able to uh either wind down, provide liquidity and have have a greater control in the economy rather than priv private operators. For much of its history, uh Treasury uh had a seat at the table on the Federal Reserve. Post World War II that stopped. And then if we look at more recent history, what happened after the great financial crisis? We saw this paralysis in the economy. I think a huge part of it which has been part of my regulatory agenda here at Treasury this year through the financial stability oversight council is undoing these the poorly thoughtout crisis crisis legislation. But what the crisis legislation did and look after financial I I've studied and taught at Yale the history of financial crisis there's always retribution and you you go from a lack regulatory regime to an over constricted regulatory regime. So coming out of the traumatic GFC for for 10 years we had this over constricted regulatory regime where the Fed was deemed to be the only game in town. So you know imagine one one example would be a a home in North Florida that sold for $500,000 in 2006. All of a sudden people are handing the keys back. It is now $150,000. Great buy, great affordability, but because of the new financial regulation and the incentives that the the banks were in some cases rightly taken to the woodshed for bad behavior, but there was no incentive to give credit at the bottom. So what happened the asset owners, people with money were able to accumulate assets. We saw very poor growth during the period during the Obama administration and the the Fed cap kept rates low for very long. But what the Fed engaged in starting I believe was October 6 o excuse me March 6 or March 8th uh 2009 was the Fed began began what we call QE or largecale asset purchases. They went went in the market started buying long bonds and the theory of the case there is you create liquidity you take safe assets out of the market uh long duration safe assets and then the people who receive that money uh would buy uh more risky assets. Ben Bernani famously said when he was asked what's the purpose of QE he told everyone go buy equities. Well not everyone could buy equities. So, we we ended up with like this this two-tier economy where either you were an asset holder or you weren't and that the Fed constant probably kept or definitely kept QE going for too long. And you know, I I called the Fed the engine of inequality. And someone said to me, well, do you believe that the Fed is responsible for economic equality in the system? And I said, absolutely not. that is not one of their mandates, but they shouldn't be exacerbating it and they were the the leading cause of it. There there's a fantastic book by a I I know Karen Pedaru very well. Uh she's center left to maybe hard.

>> Yeah. Not not your politics for sure.

>> Not my politics, but her book, The Fed, the Engine,

>> her book is excellent. Yeah.

>> Engine of inequality. So we just kept pushing up these asset prices and then then we got co and uh markets became disorderly and the Fed did exactly what it should do. It came in, it stabilized the market, but for some reason they decided that they needed to continue this QE right up until the 20 I think February March of 2023 and they were in essence financing this massive debt increase 7 trillion that we that we saw during that period. So, as a long way of saying the central bank has become much more involved in the economy. I think a lot of people don't understand we've gone from what used to be fairly straightforward rate setting mechanism to now we have kind of this three-headed beast at the Fed or this very complex calculus that I don't think anyone really understands myself included. uh you have rate setting policy, you have uh balance sheet policy. So the Fed has a very big balance sheet now. And then you have regulatory.

### 美联储的“对冲基金”运作模式

主持人表示，他读到贝森特的文章中描述**美联储**的预算运作方式，发现美联储的一部分职能像**对冲基金**（Hedge Fund: 一种高风险、高回报的投资工具，通常只对合格投资者开放），承担风险，并利用其产生的收入来补贴自身运营，这让他感到震惊。他请贝森特向听众解释这一现象。贝森特解释说，美联储本应盈利，并将资金汇回**美国财政部**。过去，美联储通过**铸币税**（Seigniorage: 货币发行者通过发行货币获得的利润，通常指政府发行货币的成本低于其面值所产生的收益）等方式，每年向财政部汇回约GDP的3%。然而，当美联储开始实施**量化宽松**（QE）时，他们“高价买入”（以高价购买债券，利率较低），现在正以套利的方式每年损失约1000亿美元。

>> Well, there's a part of your article which was stunning to me where you describe how the budget of the Fed works and effectively when you understand that there's a part of the Fed which acts like a hedge fund and effectively is taking risk and the revenues that they generate are used to subsidize their operations. Can you explain that for folks cuz I I didn't fully realize that that was happening.

>> Yeah. Well, well, again, the that the Fed should make money. Fed typically you used to make money and would remit money back to the Treasury. And back to to David's question of the budget deficit, the the Fed was sending back about 3% of GDP through we have senior which is the float on the currency. uh there are other operations but then they started QE and no one told the Fed that you know you're not supposed to buy high so they they they paid a high high price for bonds low interest rates and they're arbitrage the Fed's losing about hundred billion dollars a year now

### 债务成本与美联储的角色

主持人指出，影响普通民众对经济状况满意度的关键因素之一是**债务成本**，即他们购买房屋、汽车或延长贷款的能力。目前10年期**美国国债**（Treasury: 美国财政部发行的债券，被认为是世界上最安全的投资之一）利率在4.2%至4.6%之间。他询问这是否反映了联邦政府的财政状况、经济状况，或是债券市场的抛售，以及美联储在降低这些利率、使普通民众更容易获得贷款方面是否扮演着重要角色。贝森特认为，不幸的是，美联储将**现代货币理论**（Modern Monetary Theory, 简称**MMT**: 一种经济学理论，认为主权政府可以印钞来支付债务，因此不必担心预算赤字）变成了“现代货币实践”（Modern Monetary Practice）。**拜登政府**发行了大量债务，而美联储则购买了这些债务。他引用**麻省理工学院**（MIT）的一项研究，该研究精确指出，**42%的严重通胀是由预算赤字造成的，另有17%是由通胀预期上升引起的**，这意味着近60%的通胀是由政府支出造成的。贝森特强调，如果能够稳定甚至降低预算赤字，将有助于**反通胀**。他以**德国联邦银行**（Bundesbank: 德国在欧元区成立前的中央银行，以其独立性和对通胀的严格控制而闻名）为例，在欧元诞生之前，德国联邦银行拥有极高的信誉，与德国政府紧密合作。如果政府能够实现合理的财政平衡，德国联邦银行就会降低利率，为政府减少支出提供缓冲。贝森特认为，美国也可以效仿这种做法。

>> if you look at one of the key drivers of Main Street's satisfaction with their economic standing it's the price of debt, the ability for them to buy a home, to buy a car, to extend their lives, and we've got the 10-year Treasury sitting, I think, 42 to 46 right now in terms of the rate. And I guess this may be a question that brings in two other issues, the fiscal issue and the economic issue. Is that a reflection of the state of the fiscal affairs of the federal government, the state of the economy, both or the state of markets selling off bonds? And doesn't the Fed have an important role to play in bringing those rates down and making rates accessible for Main Street?

>> Well, I I think what the the Fed did, unfortunately, they took modern monetary theory from I say they went from MMT, modern monetary theory to MMP, modern monetary practice. So that the the the Biden administration issued all this debt and the Fed the Fed bought it. And there there's a very good study from MIT that's come out that shows uh you know in a way that only PhDs at MIT can be very precise. 42% of the great inflation was caused by the budget deficit. Another 17% was caused by the increase in inflation expectations which I think you could tie back to that. So you've got almost 60% David that was caused by the spending of the inflation. And I think what again to go back to my earlier point, I think what we're not getting credit for here is that if we can stabilize the budget deficit, even bring it down, that that will contribute to disinflation. If I think about central bank credibility, no in my career, probably post World War II, no central bank had more credibility than the Bundus Bank uh up until the advent of the euro. But they controlled the ger they worked with the German government and they would work with each other hand in hand. The Bundus bank would say if you give us the fiscal control if you give us if you are not prolificate if you give us the reasonable fiscal balance we will work with you we will foam the runway to allow you to decrease spending. We will decrease interest rates. And I I I think that's something we could be doing here. I

### 量化宽松的弊端与美联储的未来

主持人表示，他对**美联储**的行动感到困惑，特别是2%的通胀目标（最初由新西兰提出，而非2.5%或1.5%）。他认为，美联储的第二个任务——充分就业——相对容易理解，但**量化宽松**（QE）以及他们如何选择购买哪些资产，似乎对经济产生了巨大的扭曲效应。他询问，如果贝森特能一笔勾销，是否会彻底取消QE，以及美联储如何选择购买哪些公司债券（例如，是购买**英伟达**、**优步**和**谷歌**等优秀公司的债券，还是**福特**等陷入困境的公司或航空公司债券）。贝森特认为，大规模资产购买绝对应该作为中央银行的工具之一，但关键在于持续时间。他指出，**英格兰银行**（Bank of England: 英国的中央银行）在**新冠疫情**期间采取了最佳模式：在市场失控时介入30、60或90天以稳定市场，充当“最后贷款人”，然后退出。而美联储在债券收益率很高时购买了大量债券，如果当时停止，本可以获得巨额利润，但他们却在接近零利率时继续购买。结果是资产价格被推高，利率保持低位。许多人在疫情期间无法买房，现在利率已恢复正常，但资产价格却未恢复正常，因为许多人仍然持有疫情期间3%的抵押贷款。他解释说，传统上，美联储自2009年开始大规模资产购买以来，只购买政府债券，并选择期限。但在疫情期间，由于预计GDP将下降20-40%，他们转而购买高收益债券和公司债券指数以稳定市场。贝森特还提到了**133条款**（133 facility: 美联储和财政部之间协商设立的紧急贷款工具，用于在特殊情况下向特定行业提供流动性支持），这是美联储和财政部协商设立的，用于救助陷入困境的战略性行业，例如航空公司。他强调，这些是紧急权力，应在紧急情况下使用，但持续时间过长。

>> I'm I'm glad that you too are confused by the Fed's actions, Secretary Besson, because I read your article and while I understand the mandate to get to 2% inflation, why it's 2%, not three. I'm I'm curious about your take on that because I did a little historical uh archaeology. I understand somebody in New Zealand came up with the two target as opposed to 2.5 or 1.5 or three. Let's put that aside for a second. The thing that I think most Americans don't understand and the and the second mandate, full employment, robust employment, that seems pretty easy to understand for all of us. But this qualit qualitative easing and and how they purchase and which assets they purchase and why seems to have a massively distorting effect on the economy, at least according to your essay and and some of the other sources you cite in this essay, which we have in the notes uh for people to read. What should we be doing this qualifi this QE at all? If you had your brothers and you could just, you know, swipe a pen here and and clean this up, would you just get rid of the QE portion of what they're doing? And how do they pick? Like, how do you pick whose corporate debt you buy? You know, are you buying Nvidas and Ubers and Google's because those are great companies or Microsofts or are you buying, you know, Fords or struggling companies or struggling airlines? How are those decisions made? and and should the American people be buying those things and why?

>> Yeah. So, there's a lot to unpack there, uh, that absolutely large-scale asset purchases should be part of the so-called central bank toolkit. But I I think if we go back and look at CO, which was a real test, the the Bank of England had the best model. The markets became unhinged. They stepped in for a period I can't remember whether it was 30, 60 or 90 days. They stabilized markets and you they they were the buyer of last resort which is classic theory for what a central bank's supposed to do. They're supposed to provide liquidity. They're supposed to open a window where financial institutions can pledge collateral and do it that way. Um, and you know, I'll just point out that when the bond yields were quite high, the Fed did buy quite a bit. Uh, and they would actually have a large profit if they stopped during during that period. Instead, they continued on when we were the near near the the zero bound. And what what we've ended up with here is they pushed the asset price up. The interest rates were low. Many people couldn't buy a house during COVID, but now the interest rate has normalized. And you know, we're just in a much more normal period for interest rates, but we're not in a normal period for asset prices because so many people still have the 3% mortgages from co and back back to your question on what should the Fed buy traditionally that the Fed since large scale asset purchases began in 2009, they just bought government bonds. They they choose the duration. uh they switched uh during COVID because look there there were estimates we were going to have a 20 30 40% GDP decrease. Um so they they were buying indices of high yield bonds of of corporate bonds to stabilize the market. I think what you're alluding to Jason is also during that period in conjunction with Treasury uh there were bailouts and that's done by a facility that is negotiated between the Fed and the Treasury called a 133 facility and you identify strategic industries that may be struggling. It it would not have behooved anyone for the airline industry to go belly up because of a a virus that turned out to be quite transitory. So, you know, again, I I think these are emergency powers. I think they should have them in an emergency, but I think the duration went on much much too long.

### 美国债券需求与通胀目标

主持人询问美国债券的需求情况：中国是否仍在抛售？是否有新的买家出现？以及当前资本市场如何看待美国债务？贝森特引用**约翰·梅纳德·凯恩斯**（John Maynard Keynes: 20世纪最有影响力的经济学家之一，凯恩斯主义经济学的创始人）的话说，经济学就像一场“选美比赛”，你只是在猜测谁会赢。他指出，美国去年是全球赢家，自2020年以来表现最好的债券市场和整体市场。原因包括财政进展、关税政策（从“末日机器”变为财政偿还的“应许之地”）以及通胀预期保持稳定。关于2%的通胀目标，贝森特认为，当通胀高于2%时，很难在半空中调整目标，因为这会让人觉得是在“向上作弊”。他相信，一旦通胀回到2%的目标，就可以讨论一个区间（例如1.5%到2.5%或1%到3%）。他强调，经济和市场是生物学，而非数学或物理学，它们是非线性的、非常复杂的系统，存在突变，因此追求精确到小数点后的确定性是荒谬的。他认为，必须先重新锚定目标并保持信誉，然后才能讨论一个合理的区间。

If you're now in the bond sales game, Secretary Bessent, I mean, you you've been on the other side of the market, but now you're selling the bonds. What do you see in terms of appetite for US bonds? Has China disappeared? Are they still selling down? Are there other buyers emerging? And how does broader capital markets look to US debt in this moment? Well, it's it's like the John Maynard Kaine said said a lot lot of economics is is a beauty pageant. You're just picking like who do you think's going to win? And that that the U the US became the the worldwide winner last year. We had the best performing bond market, best performing market since 2020. And I I think that was for a combination of reasons. One was the fiscal progress we made and everyone went from the tariffs. They were a doomsday machine to hm maybe tariffs are taking us to the promised land in terms of fiscal payown. And uh I I also think inflation expectations have remained well anchored. Back to Jason's question, why 2%? We've chosen 2%. And I I I think it it's very difficult to do a midair refueling or to call an audible on two when you're above two because then it looks like when you're above a level, you will always fudge upward. So I I think there is a very robust conversation to get back once we are back to two which I I think will be in sight then we can have a discussion is it much smarter to have a range like what what drives me crazy the the economy the markets are biology they're not math they're not physics they're they're nonlinearities they're very complex systems they're mutations in the system and this idea that we can have this decimal point certainty is just absurd. So I I believe that once we re anchor to the target then we could talk about a range and we could decide whether the range is from 2.5 to 1.5 is it from 1 to three but I I think it's very difficult to uh reanchor until you meet the target and maintain credibility.

### 美联储主席候选人与未来角色

主持人询问**特朗普总统**正在面试的**美联储**主席候选人，包括**凯文·沃什**（Kevin Warsh）、**凯文·哈塞特**（Kevin Hassett）、**克里斯·沃勒**（Chris Waller）和**里克·里德**（Rick Reed），他们将如何重塑美联储，使其回归到贝森特所倡导的受限模式。贝森特表示，许多候选人已经明确表示希望缩小美联储在经济中的足迹和机构本身。他指出，美联储不依赖拨款，自己印钱，有自己的预算和警察部队。他提到了华盛顿特区美联储大楼的巨额成本超支，并对比说如果**美国财政部**出现类似情况，他肯定会在国会受到严厉质问。这些候选人都主张美联储回归更传统的角色，退居幕后，使其运作更具可预测性，而不是让市场、经济和美国人民的命运都系于其一言一行。他们讨论了取消“**点阵图**”（Dot Plot: 美联储官员对未来利率路径的预测图）以及区域联储银行的改革。虽然没有人提议取消区域联储银行或其行长，但他们讨论了是否应该让每个区域联储银行专注于某个专业领域，回归“卓越中心”模式，以避免功能重叠。作为一名经济史学家，贝森特认为面试过程非常棒，因为他有机会采访了11位对经济学、美联储和货币政策最了解的人。他相信自己比国内任何人都更清楚需要做什么，每个人都希望看到美联储的足迹更小，运作更具可预测性。

Maybe as we wrap up on the Fed, can you give us a sense of the candidates that are being interviewed right now by President Trump, Kevin Wish, Kevin Hasset,

>> Waller,

>> Chris Waller, and Rick?

>> Chris Waller, Rick Reed. How do you think each of those will try to reshape the Fed more in this constrained mode that you're advocating for? Well, I I I think many many of them have already come out and said that they uh do want to shrink it both as the footprint of the institution in the economy but shrink the institution itself that the the Fed does not as we talked about earlier the the Fed does not rely on appropriations. The Fed just prints its own money and it's has its own budget and as I talked about in the article it has its own police force. has its own, you know, we've seen the big cost overruns at the building uh here in DC. If like if Treasury the we're looking at new buildings for the the men of the Bureau of Engraving, if we had that kind of cost overrun, I can guarantee you that I would be up in Capitol Hill getting a the welldeserved earful.

>> Yeah. You'd be pillared. Yeah. So, um, but e each one of them has talked about moving back toward the more traditional Fed role, moving into the just getting the Fed back into the background. You know, it it it wasn't meant that the market and the economy and the American people were supposed to hinge on every word. It was supposed to be a predictable process. You know, I I think many many of them have talked about getting rid of this so-called dotpot, the summary of economic projections. Uh they they've talked about what should we do uh with the regional banks. No one no one's talking about getting rid of them or the regional bank presidents, but should each one of the regional banks have a specialty, go back to a center of excellence? Why do we have so many overlapping functions? Uh, you know, I I can tell you for for me as someone who's an economic historian, the interview process has been fantastic because I I got to interview 11 of the most knowledgeable people on economics, the Fed, monetary policy. One time I got to interview five another time and I'll be with four of them with the president. So, you know, I I think I understand probably better than just about anybody in the country what needs to be done and everyone wants to see a de a smaller footprint and more predictability from what's going on.

### 2026年普通民众的展望与国家资本主义

主持人询问**贝森特**能向普通民众承诺2026年会有什么变化，以及哪些因素是他无法控制的（例如房屋供应）。贝森特表示，由于存在不确定性，他无法做出任何承诺。但他指出，**美国财政部**正在放松对小型银行的金融监管，因为自**全球金融危机**（GFC）以来，约一半的小型和社区银行已经消失，过去的政策使得这些银行“太小而无法成功”。政府正在尽一切努力释放这些银行的贷款能力，提高它们的盈利能力，使其更好地服务社区并提供更多贷款。他指出，美国70%的贷款、30-40%的房地产贷款和40%的小企业贷款都来自这些服务普通民众的银行。因此，他可以承诺信贷的可获得性将大大增加。他还承诺，政府不会“挥霍”预算赤字，不会出现**麻省理工学院**（MIT）的研究报告指出“**特朗普2.0**”通过预算赤字导致通胀的情况。此外，政府正在努力提高工薪阶层的工资。在**特朗普总统**的第一任期内，时薪工人的表现优于管理层工人，底层50%家庭的净资产增长幅度大于前10%的家庭，政府正努力创造一个公平的竞争环境。

主持人接着询问，对于一个保守派政府而言，采取股权投资、放松监管或参与贸易等方式对私营企业进行大规模干预，这是否可以被称为“**国家资本主义**”（State Capitalism: 一种经济体系，政府在经济中扮演重要角色，拥有或控制大量企业，并直接干预市场）？这是一种战略性利益，还是政府在经济中扮演角色的永久性转变？以及这如何符合自由市场原则？贝森特认为，这要回到“纯粹、不受限制的自由贸易并非公平贸易”的观点。当竞争对手（如中国、越南、欧洲某些国家）获得高额补贴时，完美的**李嘉图等价**（Ricardian Equivalence: 一种经济学理论，认为政府通过债务融资的减税政策不会影响总需求，因为消费者会预期未来增税而储蓄）就不复存在，由此产生的扭曲导致了巨大的资本池。除了贸易政策，还有**国家安全政策**。**新冠疫情**让我们认识到国家安全的重要性，打破了过去认为“拉长、自由流动的供应链是最好的”这一范式。事实证明，最有效率的并非总是最安全、最稳健的。在疫情期间，我们发现中国成为不可靠的供应商，印度和其他国家也出人意料地维护自身国家利益。因此，政府正在介入并投资于五到八个战略性行业，这些行业需要美国本土或至少在北美或西半球进行**内生性生产**（Endogenous Production: 生产要素或技术进步来源于经济系统内部，而非外部）。他将其比作二战时期，我们正处于一场经济战，不希望其演变为军事冲突，但必须做好准备。他举例说，美国80-90%的药品前体化学品来自海外（主要来自中国或印度）；全球97%的先进芯片制造集中在台湾，这是对世界和美国经济最大的威胁，甚至超过他70年代经历的阿拉伯石油禁运。因此，我们需要将一部分芯片制造、钢铁、造船和制药业带回美国。

>> So, what happens in 2026 for Main Street? What can you promise them? What can you not promise them? What is out of your control? because we talk a lot about hey the speed limit and mortgage rates but you can't in your position correct me if I'm wrong have a dramatic impact on the supply of homes as one example so and so whatever you put the rates at it could just drive the prices of those homes up if we lower rates too quickly and then we have another situation like the great financial crisis where people are over bidding uh the the the remaining housing stock so what can you actually promise to the American people will happen in 2026 on Main Street. We know Wall Street's going to be fine and and these American entrepreneurs and these companies are firing on all cylinders. Fantastic. Lots of regulations taken out of the way, but what what can Main Street expect from the administration in 2026?

>> Jason, two two things is one there there's nothing I can promise because that there's always a degree of uncertainty. Uh but one one of the things that we've been doing here at Treasury when we talk about loosening the financial regulations that the companies that suffered the most under these regulations were the small banks. So we have seen small and community banks disappear at an alarming rate. About half of them have disappeared since the GFC. So I what I can promise is that the regulatory regime for those banks is being loosened and is the the saying that there's three eight banks in the US that are too big to fail that the policies since the GFC were too small to succeed and we are doing everything to unleash the lending capability of these banks the pro their profit profitability will enable them to be part of their communities to lend more. 70% I think I do the statistics 70% of a lending 30 40% of real estate lending 40% of small business lending are from these main street lenders. So I can tell you there's going to be a bigger availability of credit. I can tell you that we are not going to blow out the budget deficit and cause you you will not see an MIT study that says that the Trump 2.0 caused inflation through the budget deficit. And I I can also tell you that we are working to increase working wages. In President Trump's first term, hourly workers did better than supervisory workers. bottom 50% of households had a better increase in net bigger increase in net worth than the top 10%. So you know we we are trying to level the playing field. Secretary Bessent, this is a I I would say conservative administration. And if you look at the kind of economic policy of of traditional conservative administrations, you would not assume that the administration would lead the federal government to make large investments in the private industry or to participate meaningfully in the economy. As we are seeing with some of the deals that have been done over the last couple of months where the the administration has taken equity stakes in key industries and key businesses and also has concurrently provided either regulatory unlock or or some sort of trade participation. Can you just comment on what some people are calling state capitalism? Is this from your view a a set of strategic interests or is this a permanent shift in how the the government plays a role in the economy and and and how does that make sense from a free market perspective? David, I think it goes back to the idea that free pure unfettered free trade was not fair trade. when when you have competitors whether they're chi China, Vietnam, some others uh sometimes in in Europe that have high subsidies then like this idea that perfect ricardian equivalents exist doesn't and we can see by these distortions that developed the these huge capital pools that have been developed because of the imbalances. So if that's one point but and that's trade policy but on the other side there's national security policy and the only good thing I can say about co is it woke us up to the national security took us out of this paradigm that elongated free flowing the supply chains wherever they may be were the best that the um the the most smoothly functioning was desirable. Well, it it turns out that the most efficient is not always the safest, the most robust or the soundest. And we saw that during co we we discovered that the Chinese became unreliable suppliers. Uh India and some of the other countries they acted surprise surprise in their national interest. So uh what we if you look at the industries where we are taking stakes and moving forward we've identified five to eight strategic industries where the US we have to have endogenous production or at least adjacent to us the in North America or this hemisphere. Um we and I I think of it as it's the kind of thing that you would have seen during World War II and we are in an economic war and we do not want it to become a kinetic war but we have to be prepared if if it could but when when we think about huge amount 80 90% of the precursor chemicals that go into US pharmaceuticals are made overseas majority in China or India semiconductors in in my life I believe that the greatest economic threat to the world economy to the US economy more than the Arab oil embargo that I lived through in the 70s when I was lined up with my parents to the at the pump to do odd even days because of the oil embargo. The biggest threat is that 97% of the upper level precision chip manufacturer, the advanced chip manufacturers is made in Taiwan and we need to bring a portion of that back to the US. Uh same for steel, same for ship building, same for pharmaceuticals. So the interventions are all the in those areas.

### 减税政策与“特朗普账户”

主持人请**贝森特**谈谈2026年及以后将生效的减税政策和“**特朗普账户**”计划。贝森特表示，明年的减税政策有几个重要部分。首先是针对美国企业的**即时费用化**（Immediate Expensing: 允许企业在购买资产的当年立即扣除全部成本，而非分摊到多年），设备可永久性即时费用化，工厂则有四到五年的窗口期。这已经导致了**资本支出繁荣**（Capex Boom: 企业在固定资产上的投资大幅增加），并将在贸易协议的推动下进一步加速。例如，**波音公司**在南卡罗来纳州查尔斯顿的工厂正在扩建50%。这将带来就业繁荣。其次，对于工薪阶层，**特朗普总统**坚持了其竞选承诺，包括小费、加班费和社保收入免税，以及美国制造汽车贷款的可抵扣性。该法案于7月4日通过，对工薪阶层追溯至年初生效，对企业追溯至1月20日生效。作为**美国国税局**（IRS: 美国联邦政府的税务机构，负责征收税款和执行税法）局长，贝森特预计第一季度将出现巨额退税，因为工薪阶层尚未调整预扣税。家庭可能会收到1000至2000美元的退税，他们将在年初调整预扣税计划，从而自动增加实际工资。他认为这将是企业和个人减税的强大组合。

关于“**特朗普账户**”（Trump Accounts），贝森特认为这是一个“游戏规则改变者”，其影响力将超过国防和战略产业的投入。他相信，50年后回望，本届政府将被视为拯救或创造了“人人都是股权所有者”的理念。目前约有38%的美国人未直接或通过**401k计划**（401k: 美国的一种退休金计划，允许员工将一部分工资存入投资账户，享受税收优惠）持有股票。通过为每个新生儿提供1000美元的账户，政府将提高金融素养和市场乐观情绪。**美国财政部**将大力推行金融素养教育，将其推广到学校。贝森特希望，通过让每个美国人了解“钱生钱”的道理，最终将未持有股票的38%人口降至零，让每个人都能分享美国的繁荣和创新。他引用**休伊·朗**（Huey Long: 20世纪美国政治家，曾提出“人人皆为王”的口号）的话说：“人人皆为王”，而“特朗普账户”将使“每个男人和女人都成为市场参与者”。他称之为“历史上最大的合并”，因为它将普通民众和华尔街融合在一起。他回忆自己小时候在南卡罗来纳州小镇长大，对华尔街的唯一了解是1929年发生了一件坏事。他认为，人们不应该必须走上精英教育的道路才能参与市场，即使留在家乡也能参与市场并从中学习。该计划允许父母、家庭成员和雇主额外存入5000美元，慈善家如**迈克尔·戴尔**（Michael Dell: 戴尔公司的创始人）夫妇也承诺投入62.5亿美元。目前已有约20个州和信用卡公司、银行参与其中，不断向这些账户注入资金。贝森特认为，美国人是世界上最慷慨的民族，而这个计划提供了一种直接、无摩擦的方式，让慈善资金直接惠及美国儿童，这是一个真正的分水岭时刻。

Scott, as we wrap, I'd like to go back to one topic you spoke about at the beginning, which is you've had to overcome a lot of Biden era difficulty and a lot of the groundwork, as you said, will be seen in 26 and beyond. And I just want to give you a final moment to talk about those in two buckets. Bucket number one is there's a lot of tax cuts that will hit starting January 1. And I think it would be good for people to understand what's coming. And then bucket number two, there's been this incredible movement and energy around Trump accounts. And you even spoke about this yesterday about the value of compounding and teaching people the financial literacy to understand what's possible for all these kids. And I just want to give you a chance to talk about those two topics as we wrap.

>> Couple points here. what we are going to see next year that if you think about the the signature parts of the the tax bill I I think that the powerful the most powerful parts uh had uh the immediate expensing for American business uh permanent for equipment and then four or five year window for factories so we are seeing already seeing a capex boom so 2025 was a capex boom. I think that is going to accelerate with all the trade deals we've done. I was just about 6 weeks ago in my hometown of Charleston, South Carolina, Boeing, the largest employer there, is increasing their plant by 50% for the Dreamliners result of the trade deals, but it's also part of the tax deal. So, we're going to continue seeing this capex boom that turns into an employment boom. on the other side for working Americans. The president I I led the administration's team up on the hill uh in terms of what was non-negotiable non-negotiable for the president and a lot of traditional Republicans didn't like his campaign promises to working Americans and the president never yielded on those. No tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on social security, deductibility of auto loans for Americanmade cars. So the the bill was done on July 4th. It's retroactive to the beginning of the year for working Americans, retroactive to January 20th. uh for corporates. So, working Americans, I I also have the honor of being the IRS commissioner, and I can see that we're going to have a gigantic refund year in the first quarter because no one changed their working Americans did not change their withholding. So I I think households could see depending on the the number of workers $1,000 $2,000 refunds they will change their withholding schedule at the beginning of the year and they will get an automatic increase the in real wages. So I think that's going to be a very uh I I think that's going to be a very powerful combo of corporate and individuals. And then the the these Trump accounts I believe are a gamecher and I think this will end up more than what he did for defense, more than he did for strategic industries. When we look back in 50 years, I think this administration will have saved or created the idea that everyone is an equity owner, that everyone has a stake in the market. Right now, about 38% of Americans do not own equities either directly or through some kind of a 401k or something. So by giving every child $1,000 at birth the for these accounts we are going to increase financial literacy. We're going to increase people's optimism in the market here at Treasury. We're going to do the a dramatic amount of financial literacy, financial education. We're going to push that out to the schools. And I I think this idea of every American learning h that money can make money for them that you know we we will close the gap over time. We'll go from 38% not owning equities that if this continues hopefully that can be zero and everybody gets a stake in American prosperity that the American innovation that you all do and I I think it is going to you when I look at sort of the the polling for young people in terms of their view of socialism, their their view of capitalism, I I think that this is going to make you know every man Huey Long said, "Every man a king." I think this is going to make a the every the man and woman a a a market participant. And I think it's fantastic. It I began the announcement the other day. I said, you know, I've talked about parallel prosperity, Wall Street and Main Street. This is the biggest merger in history because it is merging Main Street and Wall Street. And I I grew up in a small town in South Carolina. The only thing I knew about Wall Street was something bad had happened in 1929 and I was fortunate went to Yale and then u went to New York. But you you shouldn't have to have that path that if you want to stay in your hometown but participate in the market and learn a lot about it, this is the ultimate program for that. And what we're doing is parents, family members, employers can add $5,000. Philanthropists like Susan Michael Dell are going to put in $6.25 billion to top up the accounts. And then we're up to probably 20 states that are going to also top up the accounts. Uh employers, we've got uh credit card companies, banks that are already on board. and you're just going to keep pushing more money into these accounts. Americans are the most generous people in the history of the world. We have never had a direct way to get rid of the friction of philanthropy and give money directly to American children.
