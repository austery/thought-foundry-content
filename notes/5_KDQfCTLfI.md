### 市场开盘摘要

大家早上好，欢迎回到新一期的市场开盘节目。感谢各位的到来，我们正在直播，有很多内容要讨论。今天是12月4日，星期四。昨天出现了很多不同的头条新闻，我们将逐一讨论。其中最重磅的莫过于 Jensen（英伟达CEO黄仁勋）做客 Joe Rogan 的播客。我真的没想到这会发生，但它确实发生了。那个播客里有很多片段正在迅速传播开来。所以，我们会谈谈这个。

<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. Thank you everybody for being here. We are live. We've got a lot to talk about. It is Thursday, December 4th. A bunch of different headlines that came out yesterday and we will discuss them. The biggest one being Jensen on Joe Rogan. I really did not expect that one to happen, but it did. And we got a bunch of clips from that podcast that are going pretty viral. So, we'll talk about that.</p>
</details>

今天早上我有一些新的更新。我们得到了一些失业申请数据和劳动力市场数据，有好有坏。还有关于 Palantir 的消息。我知道自从财报发布以来，Palantir 在过去几周里并没有太多新闻。很多人都在问发生了什么。嗯，他们今天发布了一个公告，而且是个相当重大的公告。哇哦，就在我说话的时候，Vlad（Robin Hood CEO）正在上 CNBC。好了，这就是我们为什么需要多个屏幕。我们是一个专业的媒体制作。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I got some new updates this morning. We got some jobless claims data. We have some labor market data. Some of it being good, some of it being bad. We've got Palantir. I know Palantir has not really been in the news for the past couple weeks, ever since earnings. A lot of people have been asking what's going on. Well, they put out an announcement today and it's a pretty big one. That was Oh, wow. And as I'm talking, Vlad's on CNBC. All right. Boom. This is why we have multiple screens. This is We are a professional media production.</p>
</details>

好的，让我们切换到 Vlad 的画面。这就是我们有两个屏幕的原因，然后我们会讨论今天所有的头条新闻。Robin Hood 的 Vlad Tenev 正在直播。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Let's go to Vlad. Here we go. This is why we have two screens and then we'll get into all the headlines that we got today. Vlad Tenev of Robin Hood live right now.</p>

### Robin Hood CEO探讨预测市场的价值

>> 这最终会是什么样子？我的意思是，A，谁在使用它，他们如何使用？B，是否会有10家、20家公司以不同的方式做这件事？还是说所有这些都会合并成两三家？在你看来，这会是什么样子？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> What is this all what does this all ultimately look like? Meaning A, who's using it and how are they using it? But B, are there going to be 10 20 uh firms that basically are doing this in different ways? Is there is it all going to be merged up into two or three of them? What does this look like in your mind?</p>
</details>

>> 是的，这里有两点。第一，很多人不了解**预测市场**（Prediction Markets: 一种允许参与者就未来事件结果进行交易的市场），那就是实际上只有相对较小比例的客户在与预测市场互动时进行交易。更大的用例是作为一个信息来源，几乎可以看作是新闻的补充或替代品。这就是为什么你看到很多新闻网络开始将预测市场整合到他们的报道中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I mean two things there. one uh what one thing a lot of people don't understand about prediction markets is actually a relatively small percentage of the customers that are interacting with prediction markets are actually trading the much bigger use case is as a source of information almost as a complement or alternative to the news and that's why you see a lot of news networks starting to integrate prediction markets into their reporting.</p>
</details>

>> 我认为预测市场将让世界变得更美好，或许它们已经做到了。能够准确地为任何事件定价，我认为这解决了一个我们几十年来一直存在的大问题，那就是我们被所有这些信息淹没。任何人都可以制作内容并分享观点，但你如何找到真相？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think prediction markets are going to change the world for the better. Perhaps they already have. And the ability to price any event accurately, I think solves a big problem that we've had for multiple decades, which is we're flooded with all of this information. Anyone can produce content and share an opinion, but how do you get to the ground?</p>
</details>

>> 但有趣的是，你更多地把它看作……告诉我，也许我错了。你是否把它看作一个经济工具，也就是说，我说的经济工具是指像交易所或像你们这样的公司，通过它创造一个盈利的业务，因为最终有数百万计的人在预测市场中进行交易？还是说，从中产生的海量数据最终更有价值？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> But it's interesting you're thinking about it more and tell me, maybe I'm wrong. Are you thinking about as an economic vehicle, meaning when I say economic vehicle, something as an an exchange or a company like yours that creates a profitable business because you know millions and millions and millions of people ultimately are actually trading in the prediction market or is it the funnel of data that's coming off of it that ultimately is more valuable?</p>
</details>

>> 我认为就对社会有价值而言，数据流更有趣。因为，比如说，只有几十万人会真正想去交易选举中发生的事情，但谁有可能赢得选举的信息，是影响数亿人的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think that in terms of what's valuable for society, right, the funnel of data is much more interesting because, you know, whereas only let's say hundreds of thousands of of people will actually want to trade what's happening in the election, the information of who's likely to win an election is something that affects hundreds of millions.</p>
</details>

>> 但我想这就是我的问题所在。最终，你真的认为只有几十万人会交易这些东西吗？还是你认为它实际上会变成一个更大的业务，即交易本身？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> But I guess that's where I'm going with this. Ultimately, do you think it really is only hundreds of thousands of people who will trade this stuff? um or do you think it actually turns into be a much larger business, the trading of it unto itself?</p>
</details>

>> 我们开始看到的是，在 Robin Hood，我们大约一年前从一个合约开始，那就是总统选举合约，现在我们有超过1500个，甚至可能有2000个或更多。这个数字会继续增长，并且会变得越来越专业化和细化。所以我认为，总的来说，这将增加交易者的总数。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> What we're starting to see is that, you know, Robin Hood, we started with one contract uh a little bit under a year ago, which was the presidential election contract, and now we have over 1,500 uh I think maybe even 2,000 or more. And that's going to continue to grow, and it's going to continue to get more specialized and granular. So I think it will in aggregate increase the total number of traders because</p>
</details>

>> 我的意思是，这些产品允许你相对于其他衍生品进行专业化操作。它们有非常明确的结算标准。你可以清楚地了解合约何时会以正面或负面结果结算，而且你不必担心你的退出点，退出点是固定的。但我认为，对于任何单个合约，交易者的数量可能不会很大，但总的来说，会有更多的合约。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I mean the products allow you to specialize relative to other derivative products. They have pretty clear resolution criteria. You can kind of understand when the contract resolves positively or negatively and you don't have to worry about your exit point, right? the exit point is sort of like put so but I think for any individual contract the number of traders might not be huge but in aggregate there's going to be lots more contracts</p>
</details>

>> 我对预测市场还有另一个问题，我一直在思考。我现在认识几个人，他们说他们玩预测市场是为了对冲他们正在做的其他事情。也就是说，他们可能在某些领域持有股票，但他们用预测市场来对冲这些东西。这让我开始思考，那么当我们看到一个预测市场情景的结果时，如果有人实际上是为了抵消其他东西而交易它，那个情景还可信吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> the other prediction market question I have that I've been thinking a lot about is I know a couple people now who say they're playing the prediction market as a hedge against other things that they're doing meaning they might own stocks and something but they're using the prediction market as a hedge against those things which made me start to think well then when we see the results of a prediction market scenario scenario is that a believable scenario if in fact somebody's trading trading it to actually offset something else.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。嗯，每个衍生品市场都有三种参与者。有试图预测价格的投机者，有转移风险的对冲者，还有连接所有不同市场的套利者。我认为一个功能正常的市场必须有这三者的平衡。你不能只让人们对冲，就像你说的，因为那样它就不会反映正确的……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Well, every derivatives market has three participants. You have the speculators who are trying to predict the price. You have hedgers that are offloading risk and then you have arbitrurers who are connecting all the different markets together. And I think for a functional market there has to be equilibrium of those. You can't just have people hedging to your point um because then it won't reflect the right</p>
</details>

>> 如果没有投机者，它就不会是一个有效的价格，对冲效果也不会那么好。我认为这是人们不理解的另一件事。投机实际上是任何市场运作不可或缺的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> it wouldn't be effective price if it wouldn't be as effective of a hedge without speculators. I think that's another thing that people don't understand. Speculation is actually integral to the functioning of any of any market.</p>
</details>

>> 你确实需要一些投机。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> You do need some speculation.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，问题在于你是否能实现所有这些参与者的平衡。而且我确实认为，回到你第一个问题，它会像其他股票和衍生品市场一样发展，会有很多交易所。我认为 Robin Hood 在那样的世界里会受益，因为很多交易所意味着我们作为经纪商有很多选择，最终为客户带来更好的定价和更多的竞争。就像我们在加密货币或股票方面做的那样，我们连接到几十个不同的交易场所和做市商，然后将订单路由到提供最佳选择和价格的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. the the the thing is can you have the equilibrium of of all of those and and I do think to your first question it's going to evolve similarly to other equities and derivatives markets where there will be a lot of exchanges and I think Robin Hood benefits in that world because a lot of exchanges means lots of choice for us as the broker ultimately better pricing more competition for the customer and like we do on the crypto side or the equity side we connect to dozens of different venues and market makers and route to whoever offers the best selection and price.</p>
</details>

>> 只是现在有很多担忧。我们前几天请了 Stifel 的 Ron Chris 来，他谈到了各种投机行为的兴起，包括赌博、预测市场、永续期货，所有这些东西。然后我回想起，这总是对大宗商品的批评。“哦，那是投机。”但商品期货的真正用途是为农民和航空公司对冲燃料成本。我的意思是，大部分交易都是为此而做的。你需要投机者来提供流动性，但所有这些东西除了赌博之外，都有一个真实的用例。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I just there's a lot of hand ringing. We had had Stifel on the other day, Ron Chris talking about the rise of all types of speculation including gambling, prediction markets, perpetual futures, all these all these things. And then I think back to that was always a wrap on commodities. Oh, it's speculation. But the the real use for commodity futures is for farmers and airlines that are trying to hedge fuel costs. I mean the the most of the trading is is done. You need the speculators for the liquidity and they but but there's a real use case other than gambling for all this stuff.</p>
</details>

>> 嗯，就像他说的，不可能每个人都在对冲。你需要投机者。没有投机者，对冲者就没有准确的价格。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, to his point, not everyone can be hedging. You need the spec. Hedgers don't have accurate prices,</p>
</details>

>> 对吧？但是，是的，就像你说的，这是一个由来已久的批评。每当出现一个新的资产类别，比如期货，人们就会说，“哦天哪，这是赌博。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> right? But yeah, uh to your point, this is a criticism as old as time. Every time there's a new asset class, people with futures, people say, "Oh my god, there's there's gambling. There's</p>
</details>

>> “Meme 股票就是赌博。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> the meme stocks were gambling."</p>
</details>

>> 是的，我不会那么说，但我确实认为 meme 股票中存在投机行为。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. I mean, I'm not I'm not going to say that, but that there were no speculation in meme stocks, but I do think</p>
</details>

>> 但它们也可能治愈了裸卖空的情况或其他什么。你知道，这背后也可能有一个原因。所有这些事情都是一种宣泄，否则它们就不会发生，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> but also they that might have cured the naked short situation or whatever. You know, there may have been a reason for that as well. It's all cathartic, all this stuff, or else it wouldn't be happening, right?</p>
</details>

>> 市场的好处在于它们是透明的。在理想情况下，任何人都可以参与。你将许多不同的参与者聚集在一个共同的框架中。我认为这就是为什么这具有如此大的颠覆性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> The great thing about markets is they're transparent. Anyone can participate in in the ideal case. Um, and you bring together lots of different participants in a in a common framework. And I think that's why this has been so disruptive.</p>
</details>

>> 你现在看到你的客户群在加密货币方面发生了什么？因为我们每天都在谈论加密货币。比特币，你知道，跌下来了。我是说，真的跌下来了。现在我们在92,000美元。所以最近的低点是多少，大约85,000？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> What What do you see happening with your with your customer base right now as it relates to crypto? Because we keep talking about crypto every single day. Bitcoin, you know, came down. I mean, really came down. Now where we we're at 92,000. So the low recently was what about 85</p>
</details>

>> 比那还低。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> below that?</p>
</details>

>> 比那还低。你认为比特币的价格与现在股市的情况有多大关联？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Below that. And how connected do you think the price of Bitcoin is to what's happening in the equity markets right now?</p>
</details>

>> 是的，我认为股市一直相当强劲，这是你可以通过预测市场看到的另一件事。我最喜欢看的东西之一是美联储的决策合约。你看到在今年10月底，我们有大约85%到90%的概率在12月降息。然后你看到降息的概率暴跌。实际上，到11月底，领先的选项是美联储不会降息，利率将保持不变。你看到这基本上与科技行业的表现相关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I mean I think that equity markets have been fairly strong and this is the other thing that you can see with prediction markets. One of my favorite things to look at is the Fed decision contracts. And you saw toward the end of October of this year, we were at 85 roughly 90% chance of a cut in December. And then you saw the odds of the cut plummeting. And actually towards the end of November, the leading option was the Fed would would not cut. The rates would stay the same. And and you saw that that was basically correlated with how the technology sector did. Mhm.</p>
</details>

>> 所以这些事情是紧密相连的。然后现在你看看，降息的概率又回到了90%。而市场……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So the these things are are very connected. And then right now you look at the the odds of a cut back up to 90%. And the markets have</p>
</details>

>> 这正是我们刚才说的。现在我们担心的是下一次降息。任何迹象表明下一次降息可能存在问题，他们可能会跳过下一次。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> that's what we just were saying. Now it's the next cut we're worried about. Anything that that indicates that maybe the next cut is in and it is in question the next one that they may skip.</p>
</details>

>> 当然。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Absolutely.</p>
</details>

>> 现在我们担心那个了。（笑）

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And now now we're worried about that one. [laughter]</p>
</details>

>> 你也可以在市场上追踪这些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> You can track the markets on that as well.</p>
</details>

>> 嗯，但是是的，我认为比特币在过去几周里与科技股有所脱钩。当然，我认为存在一些关于dats的特殊担忧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Um but yeah, I think Bitcoin has decoupled from technology a little bit in the past couple of weeks. And I think there's idiosyncratic concerns about the dats of course. Um</p>
</details>

>> 但我们平台的好处在于，我们提供一站式服务。所以即使加密货币方面有些疲软，预测市场仍在蓬勃发展。客户们仍在存钱，他们在交易各种资产，我们希望成为他们的金融和交易超级应用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> but the the great thing about our platform we we offer everything under one roof. So prediction markets are ripping even if there is some weakness on the crypto side. Customers are still depositing money. They're they're trading a variety of assets and we want to be there financial and trading super.</p>
</details>

>> 我能很快问你一个我觉得你做得非常酷的事情吗？我是说，你做了很多很酷的事情，但是这些特朗普账户，自从和戴尔家族宣布以来，我还没见过你。我觉得这太不可思议了，真的非常了不起。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Can I ask you real quick about something that I think you're doing that's super cool? I mean, you do a lot of super cool things, but these Trump accounts, we didn't I I haven't seen you since it was announced with grad and and with DE with with the Dell family. I think it's unbelievable. It's really extraordinary. Extraordinary.</p>
</details>

>> 我认为它们可以改变世界。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think they could change the world.</p>
</details>

>> 你也参与其中，在提供一些技术方面？你是如何参与的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And you're you're involved in this in terms of uh providing some of the technology or what what do you how how are you engaged in this?</p>
</details>

>> 你是说，我们得给它起个别的名字，为了你们这些人。我是说……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Are you arguing? We got to call it something else for for you people. I mean, it</p>
</details>

>> 你是说“我们这些人”？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> you mean for me people?</p>
</details>

>> 嗯，不是“你们这些人”。我不是指你。我的意思是，对于那些讨厌特朗普的人，我们不能叫它特朗普账户。我们不能叫它这个名字，因为它们是件好事，而且有很多……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, not you people. Not I don't mean you. I mean I mean just for people that hate Trump. We can't call it Trump. We can't call because they're a really good thing and there's a lot of</p>
</details>

>> 这就是加文·纽森昨天发表的评论之一。他说特朗普劫持了这个名字，它应该叫“投资美国”之类的，不能叫特朗普，因为国家一半的人不会喜欢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> that's what Gavin Gavin Newsome yesterday made that was actually one of his comments. He said that [laughter] Trump hijacked the name and that it should be you know invest America or whatever it can't be called Trump because half the country won't won't like it.</p>
</details>

>> 看看 Vlad，就坐在那里看着爸爸妈妈为政治争吵（笑），他就像是，“伙计们，我只是提供技术。你们想叫它什么就叫什么。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Look at Vlad just sitting there watching mom and dad argue about politics [laughter] and he's just like guys I'm just providing the tech. You can call it whatever you want to call it.</p>
</details>

>> 不，但是，你认为这将如何实施？它有多容易？你有多投入？我看到你在《华尔街日报》关于此事的文章中被引用了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> No, but but but h how do you think this is going to get implemented? How easy is it? and and are you how involved you I saw you you quoted in the the journal article I think about this.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。白宫举办了一个活动，宣布这项倡议的创建，作为预算和解法案的一部分。我当时在那里，算是代表零售经纪行业。我亲自和总统谈过这件事，向他保证我非常关心此事，Robin Hood 准备提供技术资源、运营资源，投入我们最优秀的人才，因为……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. So there was an event at the White House to announce the um creation of of this initiative as part of the budget reconciliation bill and um you know we I was there sort of as a representative of the retail brokerage industry. Um, I've I've talked to the president about this personally, given him uh my assurance that I care a lot about this and Robin Hood's ready to give technology resources, operational resources, put our best people because</p>
</details>

>> 我认为这非常重要，尤其是在现在，因为让人们从小就认同我们的自由市场体系，成为美国的所有者，我认为这可以解决我们正在酝酿的许多问题。我们刚刚为迈克尔·戴尔发布了……他是少数几个好的亿万富翁之一。我的意思是，大多数……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, I I think this super important particularly now because getting people from a young age to buy into our free market system and be owners of America, I think that could solve a lot of the problems that we have brewing. We just put out for Michael Dell is one of the good billionaires. I mean, most most of them are all</p>
</details>

好的，那是 Vlad 今天早上关于预测市场的谈话。我周一也谈到过，我一直在做很多相关的研究。我很快会有一篇关于预测市场的 Substack 文章。我认为这个行业会持续存在，并且会继续增长。如果 Robin Hood 是这个行业的主要参与者，我认为他们可以有很多不同的方式来利用行业动态，不仅为公司创造收入流，还能将 Robin Hood 置于金融数据交叉点的核心位置，越来越多的人正在重视这些数据，而且我认为很多机构也会随着时间的推移而重视这些数据。好了，这就是我们今天早上和 Vlad 在 CNBC 的谈话内容。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> All right, that was Vlad this morning on prediction markets. Again, I was talking about it on Monday. I've been doing a lot of research on it. I will have a Substack post coming soon on prediction markets. I think the industry is here to stay and I think is going to continue to grow. And if Robin is a major player in that industry, I think there's going to be a lot of different ways that they can basically use what's happening in the industry to become a not only a revenue stream for the business, but put Robin Hood at the heart of the intersection of financial data that more and more people are valuing and I think a lot of institutions are going to value that data over time as well. All right, so that's what we had with Vlad on CNBC.</p>

所以，我们一直听到的关于数据中心的一切，我们看到的每一笔交易，谷歌花费400亿，Meta花费280亿，所有这些都在加速扩大规模。我的意思是，上周亚马逊花费了600亿，或者说宣布他们将花费650亿，其中150亿在印第安纳州，500亿在弗吉尼亚州用于数据中心。Palantir 就像在说：“等一下。如果你们要建所有这些数据中心，如果你们要有所有这些能源基础设施，如果你们要能够管理让这些数据中心上线并真正实现AI所需的生态系统——因为没有数据中心，没有能源，没有计算能力，这是不可能的——我们的软件应该处在这场变革的最前沿。”

<p class="english-text">So everything we've been hearing about data centers, every deal we've been seeing, Google spending 40 billion, Meta spending 28 billion, all of that accelerating at scale, I mean last week Amazon spent 60 or announced they were spending 65 billion, 15 billion in um Indiana and 50 billion in Virginia for data centers. Palunteer is like, "Wait a second. If you're going to build all these data centers, if you're going to have all this energy infrastructure, if you're going to be able to manage the ecosystem that is required to get these data centers online and actually make AI real, because without the data centers, without the energy, without the compute, it's not possible. Our software should be at the front lines of this."</p>

NVIDIA 的 AI 基础设施副总裁表示：“一场新的工业革命已经开始，在这场革命中，智能通过正在全美建设的极其复杂的 AI 基础设施供应链进行规模化生产，以增强我们的经济、劳动力和安全。通过与 Palantir 及其生态系统合作，我们正在加速转型，为 AI 时代的引擎提供动力，将数据转化为智能，并确保美国未来几十年的技术领先地位。”

### Meta削减元宇宙开支，股价飙升

当然，就在我宣布这个消息的时候，Meta 正在大涨。我今天连一个新闻都讲不完，总有别的事情发生。天哪。Meta 涨了3%。为什么 Meta 在涨？他们是不是宣布了什么新东西？哦，如果 Chris 正在睡觉，他肯定会以某种方式知道他的期权正在赚钱，然后他就会在某个地方醒来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And of course, as I'm announcing this, Meta is pumping. I can't get through one news story today without something else happening. Goodness gracious. Meta 3% right here. Why is Meta pumping? Did they announce a new Oh, but Chris is about if Chris is sleeping. This is going to somehow he's just going to know that his options are printing right now and he's going to wake up somewhere.</p>
</details>

好的，Meta 为什么在动？我甚至还没讲完我的 Palantir 部分。Meta 怎么了？我没看到头条新闻。肯定很快就会有消息出来。我们等一下再回到 Palantir。让我先看看 Chris 为什么没在睡觉的原因。看，我就知道他在。我就知道他在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Why is Meta moving? Can't even get through my pounder segment. What's going on with Meta? I don't see a headline. There's got to be something coming pretty soon. We'll talk about we'll get back to pounder in a second. Let me just see the reason why Chris is not sleep. See, I knew he was there. I knew he was there.</p>
</details>

哦我的天哪。哦我的天哪。他做到了。他做到了。Meta 扎克伯格计划为元宇宙项目削减高达30%的开支。哦我的天哪。扎克伯格醒悟了，他意识到他不能再继续在元宇宙上花钱了。哇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. He did it. He did it. Meta Zuckerberg plans up to 30% cuts for metaverse efforts. Oh my goodness. Zucks woke up and he realized he can't keep spending on the metaverse. Wow.</p>
</details>

哇。顺便说一句，Chris、Steve 和我大约三周前做了一个关于 Meta 的播客，我们都同意的一件事是，如果扎克伯格站出来说，“是的，我们可能不再需要像 Reality Labs 这样的一些项目了”，然后说，“嘿，我们要稍微缩减一下开支。”股票就会上涨。他们只需要这样做。他们只需要这样做。这也是 Chris 论点的一部分。这就是他为什么买那些裸看涨期权的原因。他知道，或者至少他有一个论点，即扎克伯格最终会削减一些老实说毫无意义的开支，而股票会对此做出反应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow. By the way, Chris, Steve, and I had a had a Meta podcast like three weeks ago, and one of the things we all agreed on was that if Zucks comes out and says, "Yeah, we kind of don't need some of these initiatives like Reality Labs anymore, and just says, "Hey, we're going to pull back a little bit. Stock's going to go up." That's that's all they had to do. That's all they had to do. And this was part of Chris's thesis. That's why he bought those naked calls. He knew that or he at least had a thesis that eventually Zux would pull back some of this honestly nonsense spending and the stock would react to that.</p>
</details>

看那个。扎克伯格说：“我也想参与这场圣诞老人行情，我正在削减我的开支。”哇，老兄。这也太合理了。就像，根本没人用元宇宙。他们上个季度亏了40亿美元。不是去年，是上个季度。在90天里，他们在一个没人用的东西上亏了40亿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look at that. Zuck said, "I want to be in this Santa Claus rally as well and I am pulling back my spend." Wow, dude. This was also This makes so much sense. Like no one uses the metaverse. They lost $4 billion last quarter. Not last year, last quarter. In 90 days, they lost four billion on something no one uses.</p>
</details>

今天涨了30美元。而且还在涨，没有停下来的意思。Meta 涨了34、5、6、72美元。哦，Chris 今天不用上班了。Chris 会整天盯着这些期权。就是这样。恭喜那些抄底 Meta 的人。我是说，我也抄底了 Meta。我没有像我们的朋友 Chris Patel 先生那样重仓买入，所以我不应该得到像他那样的疯狂收益。这就是市场的美妙之处。如果你有信念，如果你逆着共识意见下重注，你可能会得到回报。所以对于那些重仓抄底 Meta 的人，恭喜你们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">30 bucks on the day. And it's going it's it's not stopping. $34 5 6 72 on Meta. Oh, but Chris is not going to work today. Chris is Chris is going to be staring at these options all day. There you go. Congratulations if you bought the Meta Dip. I mean, I bought the Meta Dip. I did not buy as heavily as our friend, Mr. Chris Patel and that's why I shouldn't get the crazy gains as our friend Chris Patel. This is the beauty of the market. If you have conviction, if you go against the the consensus opinion and you take a heavy bet, you could be rewarded. And so for those that heavily heavily bought this meta dip, congratulations.</p>
</details>

这很重要，我认为现在开盘后，这股涨势会被抛售吗？当然，任何事情都有可能。但如果它被抛售，人们会再次抄底，因为你猜怎么着？每股收益（EPS）刚刚上升了。营业收入刚刚上升了。自由现金流刚刚上升了。我的意思是，几乎所有华尔街关心的运营指标，尤其是在**资本支出**（Capex / Capital Expenditure: 公司用于购买、维护或升级实物资产的资金）高昂的时代，华尔街希望看到某些垂直领域得到有效投资，即使你的资本支出很高。所有这些指标都上升了。如果这份报告是正确的，即扎克伯格将元宇宙开支削减30%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh this is big and I think when the market opens now, could this get sold off when the market opens? Sure, anything is possible. But if it gets sold off, people are buying that dip again because guess what? EPS just went up. Operating income just went up. Free cash flow just went up. I mean, pretty pretty much every operating metric that Wall Street cares about, especially in the age of hyper capex spend where Wall Street wants to see certain verticals that are um effectively being spent even if your capex is high. All of those metrics just went up. If this report is correct, that Zucks is pulling back metaverse spending by 30%.</p>
</details>

就是这样。（笑）这就是为什么 Chris 会出现在你的梦里，老兄。我说了，你们不信我。Chris 昨天在我梦里说买 Meta。我醒来时想着 Chris。我就想，我为什么会想着 Chris，老兄？然后我意识到，他刚才就在我梦里。就是这样。恭喜那些重仓抄底 Meta 的人。就是这样。5.2%，673美元。如果你有 Meta 的期权，它们今天的涨幅会远超5%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There you go. [laughter] That's why Chris was in your dream, dude. I said yes. You guys didn't believe me. Chris was in my dream yesterday saying buy meta. I woke up thinking of Chris. I'm like, why am I thinking of Chris, dude? And I realized, dude, he was just in my dream. There you go. Congratulations if you bought the meta dip heavily. There you go. 5.2% 673. If you have Meta Options, those are going to be up much more than 5% on the day.</p>
</details>

Matias 说：“我在600美元以下用尖叫机器人加仓了 Meta。”你知道今天还会发生什么吗？很多人会涌入 Meta。因为市场总是在等待一个能改变叙事的消息。抄底的人相信叙事会在它真正改变之前改变，你知道，谷歌的股东今年就深有体会。如果你在2023年叙事非常糟糕的时候买入股票，然后叙事改变了，你也看到了这种情况。你知道，这是 Meta 正在发生的又一个经典例子。所以我们开盘后会看看这能否持续。我发现它完全被抛售的可能性很小，但这是一件大事。我会试着获取更多细节。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And here is the move. Matias says, "I loaded up on Meta under 600 with a screaming bot." You know what's going to happen today as well? A lot of people are going to jump into Meta. lot of pe because you know the market waits for a piece of news that can change the narrative. The people that buy the dip believe that the narrative will be changed before the narrative changes and that's you know Google shareholders saw that heavily happen uh this year. If you bought stocks in 2023 when narratives were really bad and then the narratives changed you saw that happen as well. And you know this is another classic example happening with Meta. So we'll see when the market opens if this can sustain itself. I find it very hard to believe it completely sells off but this is a big deal. I'll try to get some more details on it.</p>
</details>

目前，头条新闻是扎克伯格将元宇宙开支削减30%。另外，我们即将谈论的另一条 Meta 新闻是，他们刚刚从苹果挖走了一位高级设计工程师，来 Meta 从事一个新产品的开发。所以这也是一个大新闻，因为离开苹果的那个人在那里工作了很长时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right now, the headline is Zux is pulling back 30% um of metaverse spend. And also the other meta news we're about to talk about is that um is that uh they just they just poached one of Apple's senior design engineers to to work on Meta or to to work on a new product at Meta. So that that's also a big piece of news just given the person who left Apple has been there for a long time.</p>
</details>

据报道，马克·扎克伯格和 Meta 预计将大幅削减用于构建元宇宙的资源。据报道，高管们已经讨论了明年为元宇宙部门削减高达30%预算的可能性。所以这不会在下个季度的财报中体现出来，但对于2026财年的指引，如果他们削减30%的元宇宙开支，可能会有显著的增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh Mark Zuckerberg and Meta have reportedly expected to meaningfully cut resources for building the Metaverse. Executives have reportedly discussed potential budget cuts as high as 30% for the Metverse group next year. So this won't show up in the next quarter's earnings, but for fiscal year guidance 2026, that could have a meaningful increase if they're cutting 30% of the spend for the metaverse.</p>
</details>

当然，这笔开支可能会从元宇宙转移到资本支出上。所以这里有一个细微的差别，即这笔开支可能不会自动显示在运营指标中，因为它只是被转移了。然而，如果它被转移到像AI这样有真正成功机会的事情上，而不是一个没人用的元宇宙，那么也许华尔街会原谅它。你知道，也许华尔街不会很快把它送回800美元，但华尔街会原谅它，他们更愿意赌扎克伯格再花150亿在资本支出上，而不是150亿在元宇宙上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now granted, that spend might leave the metaverse and go to capex. So there there is a nuance here that the spend might not automatically show up in the operating metrics because it's it's just being diverted spend. However, if it's being diverted spend on something that has a real chance of working like AI, not a metaverse that no one uses, then maybe the street forgives it. You know, maybe the street doesn't send it back to 800 anytime soon, but the street forgives it and they're more excited to bet Zucks on spending another 15 billion on capex versus 15 billion on the metaverse.</p>
</details>

所以就是这样。是的。看，这实际上对英伟达是利好的，因为如果资金要回到GPU上，那么对博通、英伟达、谷歌都是利好的，如果会有更多的TPU，对AMD也是利好的。你知道，Meta 就像是AMD最大的客户，或者第二大客户。所以你看到英伟达也因此小幅上涨了0.53%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there you go. There you go. Yeah. And look, this is actually bullish Nvidia because if it is going to go back to GPUs, bullish Broadcom, Nvidia, Google, if there's going to be more TPUs, AMD, you know, Meta is like I think AMD's biggest customer or their second largest customer. So you got Nvidia getting a little pump right there as well, 0.53%.</p>
</details>

老实说，这对整个市场都是利好的，因为很多在元宇宙上的开支对我们所有人都没有任何好处。对 Meta 的股东肯定没有任何好处。所以如果这笔开支被转移到其他项目上，并最终进入那些我们都持有的、能从这些项目中受益的其他股票，那么是的，这实际上对整个市场来说是一个非常好的消息，不仅仅是 Meta 本身。Meta 现在上涨了5.7%，达到675美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know, honestly, this is bullish the entire market because a lot of that spend on the metaverse was doing nothing for all of us. Definitely was doing nothing for Metaverse shareholders or for Meta shareholders. So if that spin is diverting and just going into other initiatives and eventually into other stocks that benefit from those initiatives that all of us own that that yeah that's actually a really good announcement for the entire market not just Meta itself. Meta right there 5.7% 675 on the day.</p>
</details>

### 投资人激辩Meta的战略转向

好的，这就是关于扎克伯格的消息。我们稍后会回到这个故事，看看能否得到更多细节。为了总结一下 Palantir 的情况，我认为 Palantir 的公告是一件非常非常大的事。他们正在与英伟达合作，打造一个全新的产品。这个名为 Chain Reaction 的新产品的创始合作伙伴是英伟达。看起来 Palantir 正在将他们的软件带入一个以指数级速度增长的最大行业之一，那就是数据中心和能源。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right so that's what you got for Z. We'll get back to that story in a bit and we'll see if we can get some more details to wrap up what's going on in the world of Palunteer. Again I think the Pounder announcement is a very very very big deal. They are partnering with Nvidia to build a brand new product. The founding partner of this new product called chain reaction is Nvidia. And it looks like Palenter is bringing their software to one of the largest industries growing at an exponential pace which is data center and energy.</p>
</details>

现在，这是 Palantir 方面的引述。让我把这个调出来。这是来自 Tristan Grusa，他是 Palantir 能源和基础设施投资与建设的负责人。“能源基础设施建设是我们这一代的工业挑战。然而，该行业所依赖的软件并非为这一时刻而生。我们花了数年时间悄悄部署系统，维持发电厂运行，保持电网稳定，并协调复杂的供应链。Chain Reaction 是当你为了满足AI的需求而从头开始重建时的样子。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now the pounder quote from this uh is right here. Let me pull this up. This is from Tristan Grusa who's the head of Pounder's energy and infrastructure uh in investments and buildout. The energy infrastructure buildout is the industrial challenge of our generation. Yet the software that the sector relies on was not built for this moment. We have spent years quietly deploying systems, keeping power plants running, grid stable, and orchestrating complex supply chains. Chain reaction is what it looks like when you rebuild from the ground up for the demands of AI.</p>
</details>

这是一件大事。非常有道理。我认为这将是那种公告之一，看，我不知道它今天对股票有什么影响，因为归根结底，这是一个新产品公告，不一定是一个全新的合同之类的。但如果你认为数据中心将是一个非常大的行业——我们两天前看了一些摩根大通的报告，显示了数据中心潜在市场规模的复合年增长率——是的，很明显你需要软件来使之成为现实，并以有意义的方式进行运营。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Very big deal. Makes a lot of sense. Uh I think this is going to be one of those announcements that look, I don't know if it has any impact on the stock today because at the end of the day, it's a new product announcement. It's not necessarily a brand new like contract or anything. But if you think data centers are uh going to be a very large industry. We looked at some JP Morgan reports two days ago that showed just the kager of the tan of data centers. Yeah, it's obvious you're going to need software to make that like real and to operationalize it in a meaningful way.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，很多这些10吉瓦、15吉瓦的交易，没有一个已经上线。为了让它们上线，你面临着一个巨大的能源瓶颈，比计算能力瓶颈还大，而实现这一切所需的软件，我认为显然应该是像 Palantir 这样在管理复杂能源数据集方面有关系和经验的公司之一。所以，对于 Palantir 和英伟达来说，这是一个非常重要的合作伙伴关系，他们今天宣布这个消息很有道理。我认为我们将看到 Palantir 在数据中心建设中扮演重要角色，这再次意味着他们正在扩大他们的潜在市场和收入潜力，并使他们处于这次AI建设的核心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean a lot of these 10 gawatt 15 gawatt deals like none of them have gone online. And for them to go online you have a massive bottleneck of energy more than compute and the software needed to make all that happen. I think obviously should be one of the companies like Pounder that has a relationship and experience with managing complex data sets for energy. So really important partnership for Pounder and Nvidia makes sense that they announced this today and I think we're going to see Pounder play a heavy role in the data center buildout which again is them expanding their TAM their revenue potential and them being at the heart of this AI buildout.</p>
</details>

Meta 现在上涨了6.2%，达到679美元。对于刚刚加入的观众，据称扎克伯格正在削减元宇宙的开支。根据彭博社的报道，盘前交易价为680美元，这就是为什么这只股票上涨了6.4%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Meta right here 6.2% on the day 679. For those that are just joining, Zux is pulling back metaverse spend allegedly. Um, as for Bloomberg and 680 pre-markets, that's why this stock is up 6.4%.</p>
</details>

圣诞老人行情要开始了吗？嗯，12月3日历来是12月中最糟糕的一天。我们昨天度过了12月3日，标普500指数相对平稳。Meta 的这个公告是开启圣诞老人行情的一个绝佳方式，如果我们正式开始的话。而且，这不仅对 Meta 的股东是好事。我是说，英伟达上涨了1%。为什么英伟达上涨1%？因为很明显，如果扎克伯格不在元宇宙上花钱，他很可能会在资本支出上花更多一点，或者多得多，这对其他所有人都有帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Could the Santa Claus rally be starting? Well, December 3rd again was the worst day in December historically. We got through December 3rd yesterday. S&P was, you know, relatively flat. Uh, this Meta announcement is a hell of a way to start the Santa Claus rally if we are officially starting it. And again, it's not just good for Meta shareholders. I mean, Nvidia's up 1%. Why is Nvidia up 1%? Because it's kind of obvious if Zux is not spending on the metaverse, he's probably going to be spending a little bit more on Capex or a lot more on Capex and that helps everyone else.</p>
</details>

Roy 说：“我昨天把我投资组合的50%都投入了 Meta 股票。”哇。（笑）对于过去几周里大量抄底 Meta 的人来说，时机真是太好了。我是说，时机真是太他妈好了，老兄。Chris 马上就要买一架飞机了。Chris 在 Meta 上没有做价差策略。记住，价差策略会限制你的利润，因为你有卖出的看涨期权来抵消你买入的看涨期权。它减少了你需要支付的权利金，降低了你的风险，但也限制了你的利润。而对于裸看涨期权，你的利润理论上是无限的。就像 Meta 可以一直涨上去，期权也可以变得越来越值钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Roy says, "I entered 50% of my portfolio yesterday to Meta Shares." Wow. [laughter] Pretty good timing for anyone who bought the meta dip in size over the past couple of weeks. I mean, pretty pretty freaking good timing, dude. Chris is about to buy a jet. Chris Chris doesn't have spreads on Meta. Remember, with spreads, you cap your profits because you have the uh short call counteracting your long call. It reduces your premium you have to pay, reduces your risk, but it also caps your profit. With naked calls, your profit is theoretically infinite. like Meta could just keep going up and up and up and the calls could just keep getting more and more valuable</p>
</details>

这就是我们获得一些动力的原因。Chris，我马上给你打个电话。让我们听听你对此的看法，然后我们再继续。对于刚刚加入的观众，Meta 因为削减元宇宙开支的消息上涨了6%。

### 市场开盘表现与宏观数据分析

让我快速给你们看一下就业数据。它和我们之前听到的没有太大区别。在11月份，美国雇主裁员71,000人。这使得今年的裁员总数达到117万人。这标志着自2020年疫情封锁以来，首次出现年度裁员超过110万人的情况。这意味着我们需要降息。这意味着我们需要降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Real quick, let me just show you guys the jobs data. It wasn't that different from what we've heard before. So in the month of November, US employers made 71,000 new layoffs. That is up to 1.17 million layoffs for the year. This now marks the first year with 1.1 million job cuts since the pandemic lockdowns in 2020. That means that we need to cut rates. That means that we need to cut rates. So</p>
</details>

11月份裁员71,000人，是自2020年以来的最高水平。显然，这意味着我们可能应该降息。另一项实际上相对乐观的就业数据是我们每周四都会得到的初请失业金人数。这次是191,000人，而市场预期是220,000人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">71,000 layoffs in November. Uh the highest level of layoffs since 2020. Obviously, it means we probably should be cutting rates. The other piece of job data that is actually relatively bullish is jobless claims we get every Thursday. Came in at 191,000. The street thought it would come in at 220,000.</p>
</details>

所以，劳动力市场正在走弱，我们应该会得到这次降息，但它并没有恶化。我认为这是一个非常非常重要的细微差别，每个人都应该记住。如果初请失业金人数在30万左右，我们就会有问题。现在是19.1万，不好，但绝对不坏。这意味着存在一个世界，我们既能得到降息，劳动力市场又不会恶化，这最终意味着在美联储宽松政策下，企业盈利可以保持强劲。这可能为进入2026年的强劲牛市奠定基础。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So again, the labor market is weakening. We should be getting this rate cut, but it's not deteriorating. And I think that's a very, very, very important nuance for everyone to remember. If jobless claims were at like 300,000, we would have an issue. They're at 191,000. Not good, but definitely not horrible. And it means that there is a world which we get a rate cut, but the labor market doesn't deteriorate, which ultimately means that corporate earnings can be strong with the Fed easing. And that means it could set up for a strong bull market going into 2026.</p>

>> 不，不，不，不。我不需要任何分成。首先，Chris 是我最初学习期权的原因。但是，老兄，我为你高兴。重仓一百万去做一笔交易并不容易。而且理论上，这一百万是裸看涨期权，可能会变成远不止一百万。但这就是 Druckenmiller 所说的，也是 Chris 昨天分享的，这基本上总结了整个 Meta 交易。

<p class="english-text">>> No, no, no, no. I don't I don't I don't need any cut. First of all, Chris is the reason I even learned about options in the first place. But, dude, I'm happy for you. It's not easy to go 1 million deep into a trade. And that 1 million, theoretically, these are naked calls, could turn into a lot more than 1 million. But this is what Ducken Miller said and what Chris shared yesterday, which kind of sums up the entire uh meta trade.</p>

>> 嗯，我控制风险的方式有点非传统。我喜欢把我所有的鸡蛋放在一个篮子里，然后非常仔细地看着那个篮子。我想……（笑）我不知道他们在马歇尔商学院教什么，但在大多数商学院，他们教的很多都是废话，叫做风险调整后回报和多元化。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Well, my idea of risk control is a little non-conventional. I like putting all my eggs in one basket and then watching the basket very carefully. I think uh [laughter] I don't know what they teach at Marshall, but at most business schools they teach I think a lot of nonsense called risk adjusted return and diversification.</p>

>> 作为一个基金经理，如果你看一个正常的投资组合，大多数人当年70-80%的钱都是从两三个想法中赚来的，尽管他们的投资组合里有30或40个东西。我的理念是把我最有信心的那两三个想法投入进去。我也很幸运能跨资产类别交易。所以我交易大宗商品、货币、债券和股票。这给了我纪律。如果我在股票上没有好主意，我很乐意不持有任何股票，或者把我所有的鸡蛋放在一个篮子里，然后看着那个篮子。

<p class="english-text">>> As a money manager, if if you look at a normal portfolio, most people will make 70 80% of money that year on two or three ideas, even though they'll have 30 or 40 things in their portfolio. My concept was to put into those two or three ideas that I had the most conviction in. I was also lucky to travel across asset classes. So I traded commodities, currencies, bonds, and equities. And it gave me the discipline. If I didn't have a good idea in equities, I was happy to have no equities or put all my eggs in one basket and watch that basket.</p>

>> 所以，问题来了，Chris，在我问你对实际公告的看法之前。嗯，你今天早上会获利了结吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, here's the question, Chris, before I even get into the your opinions on the actual announcement. Uh, are you taking any profits this morning?</p>
</details>

>> 嗯，不。不。我认为 Meta 会被重新评级到更高。如果你看看有多少现金流被部署到 Reality Labs 部门，然后再看看这些家伙在此基础上产生的现金流，无论如何，这背后都有很多看涨的因素。所以我认为我们今天看到的很多情况是……你知道，这并不是过去没有发生过的事情。如果你们还记得，当扎克伯格在2022年受到挑战时，他削减了需要削减的冗余，以便投资于需要投资的东西，这样他就能保持公司内部的高增长水平，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Uh, no. No. I think Meta is gonna Meta is going to get rerated much higher. If you look at how much cash flow that was deployed to the reality lab section and then how much cash flow these guys were generating on top. Anyway, there was a lot of uh a lot of bullishness behind it. So I think a lot of what we're seeing today is you know and this is not something that's hasn't happened in the past. If you guys remember when when Zuck was challenged in 2022, you know, he cut the he cut the fat where he needed to to invest in the things that needed to get invested in so that this way he could maintain high levels of growth within the company, right?</p>
</details>

>> 所以这是我的一点看法，如果你看去年和今年年初，他终止了所有DEI（多元、平等与包容）项目，并开始裁掉所有表现不佳的员工。所以，你知道，归根结底，扎克伯格是公司的最大股东，他是创始人。他绝对不会让这家公司以任何方式陷入困境。所以，尽管他在这些激情项目上是个理想主义者，而且我认为他仍然会投资元宇宙，别搞错了。只是现在元宇宙对市场、对股东、对公司来说都不是最重要的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So that's the one thing I mean if you look at last year and early parts of this year, he ended all DEI programs and started cutting all low performers. So you know at the end of the day Zuckerberg is and he's the largest shareholder of the company. He's the founder. the one thing he's not going to do is let this company flounder by any means, you know. So, as much as as much of a ideologue he is when it comes to these passion projects, and I think he'll still invest in the metaverse, don't get me wrong. It's just right now the metaverse is not the most important thing to the market, to shareholders, and to the company.</p>
</details>

>> 而且，信不信由你，伙计们，每个在超大盘股领域的人，都必须尝试新事物。如果你不尝试新事物，你就会陷入创新者的窘境。你知道，你的核心市场最终会被新来者挑战，而新来者会蚕食你的市场。我的意思是，在我看来，这就是像苹果这样的公司的问题所在，苹果的顶线增长基本上是持平的，他们并没有真正投资太多其他东西。现在，他们的现金流支持了大量的股票回购，这为股东提供了回报，但同时，在未来增长方面，苹果是为了稳定，但他们可能会受到挑战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, you know, it's and and believe it or not, guys, everyone who's in the mega cap space, they have to try new things. If you don't try new things, you're going to run into the innovator's dilemma. You know, your your core markets are eventually going to get challenged by newcomers and the newcomers are going to eat away. Like I mean, this is the problem with companies like Apple in my opinion where Apple's topline growth has basically been flat and they haven't really been investing too much into other things. Now guess their cash flows are supported massive amounts of share buybacks which has provided shareholder returns but at the same time in terms of future growth Apple is there for stability but they could be challenged you know so that's the key</p>
</details>

>> 所以我认为所有的大型科技公司都有副业。看看埃隆，他什么都在做，但他仍然有多个副业。亚马逊喜欢快速失败，他们一直在尝试新事物。谷歌也是一样，老兄，谷歌在所有这些副业项目上花的钱简直了。

>> 太疯狂了。他们在量子计算上亏钱。他们在 Waymo 上亏了十年钱。他们在很多事情上都亏了钱。但问题是，你只需要有一件事成功，然后会发生什么？你的下一个增长点就会爆发。我认为扎克伯格在AI方面真的抓住了要害。而且他们不像其他仍在探索如何产生更多利润的企业，老兄，他现在正在获得即时回报。如果你看看他们的现金流量表，他们在过去两年半里将运营现金流翻了一番。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Insane. They lose money on Quantum. They've lost money on Whimo for a decade. They've lost money on so many things. But the thing is, all you need is that one thing to hit and what happens? You're your your your next leg of growth is going to explode. And I think with Zuckerberg, they've really hit the head nail on the head when it comes to AI. And they unlike the other businesses that are still kind of discovering how to generate more profitability, dude, he's getting instant ROI right now. If you look at their cash flow statement on it, they doubled operating cash flow in the last two and a half years.</p>
</details>

>> 好的。所以这里有个问题。AI 正在给他们的广告业务带来投资回报。这很公平。华尔街感到不安，因为他们除了广告之外看不到任何其他东西。至少那是当时的说法。你认为通过削减一些元宇宙成本，并可能将其投入资本支出，这种平衡表效率的对策，是否有助于改变华尔街不满的说法？或者你认为华尔街将如何长期解读这件事？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Okay. So here here here's the question then. So AI is giving them an ROI on advertising. That's fair. The street was upset because they don't see anything else besides advertising. At least that was the narrative. Do you think this counteracting of balance sheet efficiency by by getting rid of some of the metaverse costs and potentially just putting that into the capex, do you think that helps change the narrative that the street was upset about or or how do you think the street's going to interpret this long term?</p>
</details>

>> 不，我的意思是，即使从资本支出的角度来看，老兄，如果你看看他们和 Blue Owl 做的交易，对吧？很多人看到那个交易后就觉得，哇，这些家伙正走向和甲骨文一样的方向，他们承诺了所有这些资本支出，但投资回报却不存在。我就想，如果你真的看看他们和 Blue Owl 构建的交易，它对股东来说是非常非常有价值的。基本上，Blue Owl 进来，让你可以立即将某些资本支出费用化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> No, I mean even even from a even from a capex perspective, dude, if you look at the transaction that they did with Blue Blue Owl, right? So a lot of people they saw that and they were like wow this these guys are headed into the same direction that Oracle is where they're promising all this capex but the ROI is not there and I'm like don't if you really if you look at the deal that they structured with Blue Owl it's very very value accreative to shareholders where basically the one big beautiful bill came in and and made it so that you could immediately expense certain certain um certain things from your capex right</p>
</details>

>> 所以，以前，比如说你建了一栋楼，你会在接下来的30年里以一个非常低的金额逐年折旧那栋楼。所以现在你把所有这些资本都锁定了。他们和 Blue Owl 做的交易是，Blue Owl 会建造这些基础设施，Meta 会提供 GPU，而 Meta 可以立即将这些 GPU 作为成本费用化，从而在税收上节省一大笔钱。所以你不再需要在你的资产负债表上保留这些东西五年。Meta 产生的收入是惊人的。所以他们可以立即将其费用化，并利用现金流的好处，同时他们可以一直保持流动性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> so before like Let's say you built a building, right? You would spend the next 30 years depreciating that building at at a very low amount every single year. So now you're taking all of this capital and locking it away. The deal that they did with Blue Owl was that Blue Owl would build these build the infrastructure. Meta would supply the GPUs that Meta could immediately expense as a as a cost and save themselves a bunch of money on taxes. So no longer do you have to carry these things on your balance sheet for the next five years. The amount of income that Meta generates is insane. So they can expense that that that right away and take the benefit of that cash flow and they can stay liquid the entire time.</p>
</details>

>> 同时，因为他们可以保持流动性，他们可以继续进行股票回购，他们可以继续支付股息。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And at the same time because they can stay liquid, they can keep doing share buybacks, they can keep doing dividends. Yep.</p>
</details>

>> 而且还要记住，他们回购的成本，我是说，回购的**投资回报率**（ROIC / Return on Invested Capital: 衡量公司利用其资本产生利润效率的指标）远比把钱锁在某些资本里要好。这就是为什么如果你看看所有这些大公司，为什么他们不直接出去建自己的大楼，而不向房东付租金？嗯，那是因为那是他们业务中利润率很低的一部分，他们宁愿支付一些租赁费用，把剩下的钱留下来，再投资回业务中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And and also remember the cost for them for buybacks is I mean the ROIC on buybacks is way better than locking that away in some capital. That's why if you look at all these all of these major companies, why don't they just go out there and build their own buildings and and and not pay rent to landlords? Well, that's because that's such a low margin part of their business that they they would rather be paying some leasing charges and keep the rest of the money and invest back into the business.</p>
</details>

>> 对。对。所以，我认为这是很多人不一定意识到的挑战，或者说事情，那就是 Meta 在很多 AI 支出上获得的投资回报率是巨大的。老兄，我告诉你，看看他们的运营现金流。两年半的时间里，他们能够把500亿美元的运营现金流增加到1070亿美元，然后在另外两年里，现在的预测是他们将实现1500亿美元的运营现金流。你告诉我，一个拥有1500亿美元运营现金流的企业的价值是多少？同时，他们的资本支出虽然现在投入巨大，但最终会缓和下来，回到一个正常的水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Right. Right. So, I think that's the challenge that a lot not I want to say challenge, but that's like the thing that a lot of people don't necessarily realize that the ROIC that Meta is getting on a lot of their um AI spend is massive. Dude, I'm telling you, look at their operating cash flow. two and a half years they were able to take 50 billion in operating cash flow to 107 billion in operating cash flow and then in another two years that thing right now the projections are they're going to do 1.5 1 point like 150 billion in operating cash flow you tell me what the value of a business is with 150 billion in obscat operating cash flow and at the same time their capex while they're investing a ton of it right know, IT'S GOING TO MODERATE EVENTUALLY and get back to a normal normal level.</p>
</details>

>> 不，我同意，这确实感觉像是谷歌的叙事问题。他们有一个司法部的问题，但同样，市场因为一些非常外部的事情而对他们大打折扣，感觉 Meta 在这个AI叙事上也是同样的情况。那就是，投资回报从哪里来？就像你说的，营业收入翻倍意味着投资回报就在那里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> No, I agree and it really does feel like the narrative uh sort of issue with Google. They had a DOJ issue, but again, the market was discounting them so heavily over something that was so external and it feels like that's the same thing with Meta in terms of this AI narrative. That's, you know, where is the ROI coming from? To your point, offering income doubling means the ROI is there.</p>

>> 这真的很复杂，我想把技术方面和经济方面分开来看。在技术方面，我感觉非常扎实。我认为我是周围最乐观的人之一，而且我认为这是可行的。在经济方面，你知道，我也有我的担忧，即使技术非常强大并实现了所有承诺，我认为生态系统中可能有些参与者，如果他们只是犯了一个时间上的错误，如果他们只是稍微偏离了一点，坏事就可能发生。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> So, this is really complicated and I want to separate out the technological side of it from the economic side of it. On the technological side of it, I feel really solid. I think I'm one of the most bullish people around and I think it pencils out. On the economic side, you know, I I I have my concerns where even if the technology is is, you know, really powerful and fulfills all its promises. I think there may be players in the ecosystem who if they just make a timing error, if they just get it off by a little bit, bad things could happen.</p>
</details>

>> 让我来分别讲一下。在技术方面，我之所以对纯技术不感到惊讶，是因为我自己和一些后来成为我联合创始人的人，是第一批记录下AI**规模法则**（Scaling Laws: 指在人工智能领域，通过增加模型大小、数据量和计算资源，模型性能会可预测地提升的规律）的人。那就是你投入更多的计算能力，投入更多的数据到AI中，做一些小的修改。我们已经看到了像推理模型和测试时计算这样的东西，它们都是微小的调整。我观察这个趋势已经有大约12年了，自从我进入这个领域以来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, let me go through both of them. On the technological side, the the reason that I'm not in honestly by the pure technology, not that surprise is myself and some of the people who eventually became my my my co-founders, we were the first to document the scaling laws of AI, which is you put more compute, you put more data into AI with small modifications. We've seen these things like reasoning models and test time compute. They're all tiny little tweaks. And I've been watching that trend for the last 12 years or so since I joined the field.</p>
</details>

>> 所有这一切中最引人注目的是，当你用这种非常简单的方式训练这些模型时，只需做一些简单的修改，它们在几乎所有任务上都会变得越来越好。它们在编码方面变得更好，在科学研究方面变得更好，在生物医药方面变得更好，在法律方面变得更好，在金融方面变得更好，在材料和制造业方面也变得更好。而这仅仅是我们经济中所有价值来源的清单。

<p class="english-text">>> And the thing that is most striking about all of it is as you train these models in this very simple way, you know, with a few simple modifications, they get better and better at every task under the sun, they get better at coding. They get better at doing science. They get better at biio medicine. They get better at the law. They get better at finance. They get better at at, you know, materials and manufacturing. and and that's just that's just a listing of all the sources of e of of of of value of value in our economy.</p>

>> 如果我只看 Anthropic 本身，因为我们在企业端做了很多工作，我认为我们是一个很好的晴雨表，可能比其他通过消费者过滤的公司更纯粹，消费者有他们的习惯和用例。我们看我们的收入，过去三年每年都增长了10倍。2023年从零到1亿美元，2024年从1亿到10亿美元，从10亿到……它会落在8到10亿之间。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> If I just take anthropic itself, which because we work so much in the enterprise side, I think we're a good barometer, maybe a pure barometer than the others, which kind of filter through consumers, which kind of have their habits and their use cases.

我想强调一下，当每个人都说AI是泡沫时，这家伙的AI公司收入连续三年每年增长10倍。我的意思是，如果这一切都是假的，我无法理解你怎么能产生那种增长。你可以说某些部分被高估了，但你不能说它是假的，没有用例，或者它根本不真实。

>> 好的，让我来……是的。这确实涉及到第二部分。我会尽可能透明地描述。我认为存在一个真正的困境，源于经济价值增长速度的不确定性，以及建设驱动它的数据中心的滞后时间。所以我认为存在真正的不确定性，真正的困境，我们作为一家公司试图尽可能负责任地管理。然后我认为有些参与者，你知道，他们在“YOLO”（你只活一次），他们把风险拨得太远了，我非常担心。

<p class="english-text">>> So, let me let Yeah. So that really gets to the second part of it and and I I I I will describe as transparently as I can. I think there's a real dilemma deriving from uncertainty in how quickly the economic value is going to grow and the lag times on building the data centers that that drives it. So I think there's genuine uncertainty, there's genuine dilemma which we as a company try to manage as responsibly as we can.

If I'm really dumb and I extrapolate the pattern 10 to 100 billion. I don't believe that. Just to be clear, I don't I don't believe that at all. Even though it's happened in the last three years just at this scale, I don't believe it. But that's one of the outer bounds of, you know, the the outer limits of possibility.</p>

>> 如果我深入研究，比如这家企业和那家企业，这个用例和这是我们的市场推广策略。如果我试着自下而上地做，那么，你知道，也许是200亿或300亿之类的。所以我内部称之为“不确定性锥”，我不知道一年后会是200亿，还是500亿，你知道，这非常不确定。我试着以保守的方式规划。所以我计划在较低的一侧。但这非常令人不安。

So there is what what I've been calling internally this cone of uncertainty where I don't know if a year from now it's going to be 20 billion or you know it's it's going to be 50 or or like you know it's it's it's very uncertain. I try to plan in a conservative way. So I plan for the lower side of it. But but that is very disconcerting.</p>

>> 再加上建设数据中心有很长的滞后时间，大约一到两年。所以我现在必须决定，实际上是现在或者几个月前，我需要购买多少计算能力，以便在2027年初为模型提供服务，当我达到那个收入额时。这里有两个相互关联的危险。一个是我如果买的计算能力不够，我就无法为所有我想要的客户服务。我将不得不拒绝他们，把他们送到我的竞争对手那里。如果我买的计算能力太多，当然，我可能得不到足够的收入来支付那些计算能力。在极端情况下，甚至有破产的风险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And you add to that the idea that building the data centers has a long lag time. It's like a year or two. So I have to decide now, literally now or in some cases a few months ago, how how much compute I need to buy in, you know, early 20 for to serve the models in early 2027 when I get to that revenue amount. And there's two coupled dangers. One is that if I if I don't buy enough compute, I won't be able to serve all the customers I want. I'll have to turn them away and send them to to to my competitors. If I buy too much compute, of course, I might not get enough revenue to pay for that compute. And and and you know, and and you know, in the extreme case, there's kind of the risk of going bankrupt.</p>
</details>

>> 那个锥体里有多少缓冲空间，基本上是由我的利润率决定的。如果我有80%的利润率，我可以买200亿美元的计算能力，它可以服务于1000亿美元的收入。但因为那个锥体太宽了，很难避免在一方面或另一方面犯错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And how how much buffer there is in that in that cone. Um it's basically determined by my margins.

But because the cone is so wide, it's hard to avoid, you know, making a mistake on on one on on one side on one side or the other.</p>
</details>

>> 我们一直是一家相对负责任的公司。而且我认为因为我们专注于企业，我们有更好的商业模式。我认为我们有更好的利润率。我认为我们正在负责任地处理这件事。但再说一次，假设你有一个不同的商业模式。假设你有一个消费者商业模式，也就是OpenAI，你的收入来源不那么好，你的利润率不那么确定，再假设你是一个天生就喜欢 YOLO 或者就喜欢大数字的人。那么你可能会把那个拨盘转得很远。所以我认为存在一个真正的潜在风险。每当有不确定性时，就有过度扩张的风险。我们都面临着它。

Let's say you have a consumer business model, aka Open AI, you know, you're you're you're you're kind of the source of your revenue isn't as good. Your margins aren't as certain, and let's say you're a person who just kind of like constitutionally just wants to yolo things or just likes big numbers. Um, uh, then that then you may turn that dial pretty far. And so I think there is a real underlying risk. Whenever there's uncertainty, there's a risk of overextension. We all face it.</p>

>> 在谷歌，我们一直以敢于挑战“登月计划”而自豪。你之前提到了 Waymo，你知道，那已经酝酿了十多年了。我们正在研究量子计算。本着这种精神，我们的一个登月计划是，我们如何有一天能在太空中拥有数据中心，这样我们就能更好地利用太阳的能量。你知道，那比我们今天在地球上产生的所有能量多出100万亿倍。所以我们想把这些数据中心放在太空中，更靠近太阳，而且我认为我们正在2027年迈出第一步。我们会发送微型机架，把它们放在卫星里，进行测试，然后从那里开始扩展。但我毫不怀疑，十年左右之后，我们会把它看作一种更正常的建造数据中心的方式。

<p class="english-text">>> uh over time at Google we're always proud of taking moonsh shots. You mentioned Whimo earlier you know that's been over a decade in the making. We're working on quantum computing. In that spirit one of our moonshots is to how do we one day have data centers in space so that we can better harness the energy from the sun. You know that is 100 trillion times uh more energy than what we produce in all of Earth today. So we want to put these data centers in space closer to the sun uh and and I think we are taking our first step in 27. We'll send tiny uh tiny racks of uh machines uh and and have them in satellites, test them out and then start scaling from there. But there's no doubt to me that a decade or so away we'll we'll we'll be viewing it as a more normal way to build data centers.</p>

### Palantir CEO Alex Karp的政治与商业哲学

>> 在这个国家，有1%的人口在监狱里。1%的人在监狱里，因此没有任何权利。你知道你进监狱会发生什么吗？他们把你从你的孩子身边带走。你知道这发生在谁身上吗？不成比例地发生在工薪阶层，不成比例地发生在黑人和西班牙裔男性，以及底层白人男性身上。关于他们的成千上万篇文章在哪里？没人在乎。他们不在乎，因为这既不服务于强迫我投票给某个政党的欲望——这基本上剥夺了我所有的权力。这实际上就是它的作用。如果我同意说这是世界上最糟糕的事情，我基本上就放弃了我的选票。我的选票不是为你投的。我的选票是为这两个议题投的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> In this country, it you have 1% of the country in prison. 1% who were in prison and therefore have no rights. Do you know what happens to you when you go to prison? They take you away from your kids. You know who that happens to? Disproportionately workingclass, disproportionately black and Hispanic men and white men in the underclass. Where are the thousands of articles about them? Nobody cares. And they don't care because it does not either serve the ability the the the desire to force me to vote for one party, which basically takes away all my power. That's effectually what it does. If I agree to say this is the worst thing in the world, I essentially have given up my vote. My vote is not for you. My vote is for these two issues.</p>
</details>

>> 他们不在乎的第二个原因，是因为不知何故，没有人对那些人有同情心，因为我们中没有人真正与那些人打交道。在 Palantir，我们站在美国工薪阶层的立场上。我们支持那些参军的人。我们拯救他们的生命，让他们更安全地回家。我们的AI实际上让工人更富有，更有价值。而那1000万到1500万爱我的人，不管别人怎么写，他们中有一半在我们这里赚了很多钱。你知道他们是什么样的人吗？他们就像我这样的人，认为，你知道吗，我们必须做得更好。当然，我们必须做得更好。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> The second reason they don't care is because somehow no one has empathy with any of those people because no one none of us really deal with those people. At Palunteer, we are on the side of workingclass Americans. We support people who go to the military. We save their lives. We bring them home safer. Our AI actually makes workers more wealthy, more valuable. And the 10 to 15 million people that love me despite what's written, half of them made a lot of money on us. And you know what they're like? They're like people like me who think, you know what, we have to do better. Of course, we have to do better.</p>
</details>

>> 我没有改变我的政治立场。是政党改变了他们的政治立场。那种认为所谓的“进步”在任何意义上是进步的想法，完全是一场闹剧。我从 Palantir 创立之初就是进步的。我继续是。我成长在一个高度知识分子化、主要是犹太人、极其左翼的环境中。每个周六和每个周五，我都会听到一个讲座，关于保守派将如何因为非法移民而摧毁这个国家，因为它会破坏美国工人的根基。那是50年前的事了。那才是成为一个进步人士的意义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I didn't shift my politics. The political parties have shifted their politics. The the idea that what's being called progressive is in any way progressive is a complete farce. I've been progressive since the beginning of Palunteer. I'm continue to be I grew up in a highly intellectually intellectual mostly Jewish incredibly left-wing environment. And every Saturday and every Friday, I heard a lecture about how the conservatives are going to destroy this country with illegal immigration because it's going to undermine the fabric of the American worker. That was 50 years ago. That's what it be means to be a progressive.</p>
</details>

>> 成为一个进步人士并不意味着，哦，我哦，参与功能失调、永远行不通的事情、一种从未奏效的社会主义形式、没有精英管理，感觉真好。那不是进步。那是假装。老实说，那是怯懦。我以前的政党里有一半的人都知道这一点。他们不敢说出来。这永远行不通。而且它没有帮助。你知道，最大的问题是，它没有帮助他们声称要帮助的穷人。如果你认为这在帮助内城区的黑人，那你就太可笑了。这个国家任何人最不需要的就是一个功能失调的教育系统和从未奏效、也永远不会奏效的施舍。

<p class="english-text">>> Being a progressive doesn't mean just, oh, I oh, it feels so good to be involved in dysfunction, things that can never work, a form of socialism that's never worked, having no meritocracy. That's not progressive. That's pretend. That's honestly cowardly. And most people on very half my old party knows it. They don't speak up. It's [ __ ] It will never work. And it does not help. You know, the biggest problem with that is it's not helping the poor people that they claim to hurt. If you think that's helping a black person in the inner city, you're ridiculous. The last thing anyone in this country needs is a dysfunctional educational system and handouts that have never worked and are not going to work.</p>
