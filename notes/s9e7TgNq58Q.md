title: 我在阿联酋科技行业求职的真实经历：为何我拒绝了四份工作邀约
---

### 为什么考虑中东：高税负下的职业选择

厌倦了无休止地工作，却眼睁睁看着一半薪水被税收吞噬，而拥有房产（或多处房产）且无需背负30年债务的梦想，感觉遥不可及。是的，这正是前段时间让我萌生去中东工作念头的确切原因。

<p class="english-text">tired of working endless hours just to see half of your paycheck disappearing into taxes while the dream of owning a property or multiple properties without being in debt for 30 years feels like a dream yeah that's exactly what got me thinking about going to the Middle East for work some time ago as well</p>
</details>

大家好，我是**Daria**，一名**产品经理**（Product Manager: 负责产品生命周期管理，从概念到发布及迭代）。我在科技行业工作了八年，去年我在**阿联酋**（UAE: 阿拉伯联合酋长国，位于阿拉伯半岛东南部的一个主权国家）获得了四份工作邀约，但最终都没有接受。原因如下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">hi I'm Daria I'm a product manager I've been working in tech for the past eight years and last year I landed four job offers in the uee and did not accept any of them here's why</p>
</details>

我住在多伦多，我认为每个在科技行业工作的加拿大人都至少考虑过一次离开。我指的是离开这个国家。加拿大人税负沉重，更别提我们政府过去八年的决策了，可以说它们备受质疑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I live in Toronto and I think every Canadian working Tech has thought about leaving at least once I'm talking about leaving the country people in Canada are heavily taxed and don't even get me started on our government's decisions over the past 8 years they've been let's say questionable</p>
</details>

当你在科技行业工作，年薪达到20万到30万美元甚至更高时，看着你的工资单会感到心碎，你忍不住会想，如果我住在某个不会像让我偿还国债一样重税我的地方，我可能会更富有、更快乐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when you work in Tech and start pulling in $2 to $300,000 or above looking at your paycheck feels like a heartbreak and you can't help but think I could be so much richer and so much happier if I Liv somewhere where they wouldn't tax me like I have to pay off the national debt</p>
</details>

对我们许多人来说，美国是一个受欢迎的选择，但美国对每个人来说并非都是“梦想之地”，所以移民海外在加拿大人中流行也就不足为奇了。地球上没有多少地方能同时拥有充满活力的科技行业、安全、低税收和良好的基础设施，因此阿联酋是一个显而易见的选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">popular choice for many of us is the us but America doesn't exactly scream Dreamland for everyone so it's no surprise that moving abroad is trending among Canadians there aren't that many places on Earth with vibrant textin safety low taxes and good infrastructure so the UAE is an obvious option</p>
</details>

快进到最后，我决定不搬过去，并不是因为它不是一个绝佳的机会，而是因为有些真相和细微之处，往往不会出现在光鲜亮丽的领英故事中。所以，让我们来谈谈人们在领英上不常提及的事情。以下是我在阿联酋，特别是迪拜和阿布扎比，面试产品管理职位的经验总结，包括高光时刻、低谷时期，以及我最终决定不搬家的根本原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">fast forward to the end I decided not to move not because it's not a great opportunity it's just that there are some truths and nuances that often do make it to glossy LinkedIn stories so let's talk about things people don't often talk about in LinkedIn here's a summary of my experience interviewing for product management roles in the UAE specifically in Dubai and Abu Dhabi the highs the lows and the ultimate reason I decided not to move</p>
</details>

### 准备求职：专业咨询与文化差异

在我开始求职之初，我聘请了一位职业顾问，她专门帮助北美或欧洲的人士移居中东。她非常出色，帮助我完善了简历、领英档案和人脉拓展技巧，我开始在多伦多建立我在中东的人脉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">at the beginning of my search I hired a career consultant specializing and helping people move to the Middle East from North America or Europe she was great she helped me work in my resume on my LinkedIn on my networking skills and I started building my network in the Middle East from Toronto</p>
</details>

我强烈建议投资咨询服务，因为简历、求职信等内容与你在北美通常准备的有所不同。你需要为不同的市场重新塑造自己的品牌，开始专门在中东地区建立你的领英网络，并在前往之前就开始与人沟通。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I highly recommend investing money in consult ation because the resume the things that go into your CV your cover letter things like that are different from what you would typically put in North America you have to Rebrand yourself for a different Market you have to start building out your LinkedIn specifically in that area and start communicating with people before you go</p>
</details>

中东地区有着非常不同的工作沟通文化。我认识的一些过去在中东工作过的人都告诉我，中东的沟通文化很不一样，我一直在想具体有什么不同。这是一种不同的文化，一种不同的宗教，当然它会不同，但当人们告诉我时，他们不一定会解释具体哪里不同。所以，在面试过程中，我实际上学到了更多关于这方面的信息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the Middle East has a very different work Communications culture a bunch of people I know who have worked in the Middle East in the past all of them have told me that the communication culture in the Middle East is different and I was always wondering what exactly is different about it it's a different culture it's a different religion I mean of course it's different but when people would tell me that they wouldn't necessarily explain what exactly was different about it so I actually got to learn a lot more about it as I was going through the interviews</p>
</details>

### 漫长且不确定的面试流程

对我来说，第一件引人注目的事情是面试过程耗时更长。几周不回复是很常见的情况。当我第一次遇到这种情况时，我以为只是个例，但后来我意识到这是一种模式。这并不是因为你有什么问题，而是人们沟通的方式就是如此，它只是需要更长时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the first thing that stood out for me is that the interview process takes a lot longer not responding for weeks is quite common when it first happened to me I thought it was a one-off thing but then I realized it's a pattern it's not because there is anything wrong with you it's is just the way people communicate it simply takes longer</p>
</details>

在我面试过的大多数公司，第一次和第二次面试之间的间隔通常是三到四周。我至少面试了六家公司，它们的流程可能从十月开始，十二月结束，然后我会在一月底收到回复，说他们将选择其他候选人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">at most companies where I interviewed the gap between the first and the second interview would be 3 to 4 weeks there were at least six companies I was interviewing at where the process began in say October and end it in December and I would get a response from them end of January saying that they're going to proceed with a different candidate</p>
</details>

在最后阶段遭遇**“被放鸽子”**（Ghosting: 指在求职过程中，招聘方在后期突然中断联系，不再回复候选人）的情况，比在北美地区频繁得多，这同样是基于我的个人经验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ghosting at last stages happens a lot more frequently than in North America again based on my personal experience</p>
</details>

有两家我进入了最终面试的公司，在面试结束后就直接“放我鸽子”了，没有一句话，没有肯定，也没有否定，就是完全消失了。我在领英上给他们的人发了消息，给他们所有人发了邮件，也进行了跟进，但都没有收到任何回复。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">there were two companies that I had a final interview with that would simply ghost me after the final interview not a word not a yes not a no just completely disappeared I messaged their people on LinkedIn I emailed all of them I followed up not a word back</p>
</details>

回到面试本身，就像我说的，在中东地区面试需要数月时间。在北美，我认为只有**FAANG**（Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google等顶级科技公司）的面试流程时长能与之接近，因为它们无法承担如此长时间的等待，而且它们正在挑选最顶尖的人才。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">back to the interviews like I said interviews take months in North America I'd say only Fang comes close to that kind of interview process duration because they can't afford waiting for that long and they're picking the cream of the crop</p>
</details>

我无法告诉你为什么会这样，我从未在中东生活过，所以无法判断这是否是文化原因。但我的职业生涯是在北美建立的，所以我只是分享我的观察。如果你在北美或加拿大从事科技行业，这种情况几乎不会发生；如果发生了，那将是非常不寻见和罕见的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I cannot tell you why it's like that I have never lived in the Middle East so I cannot tell you whether it's cultural or not but I've built my career in North America so I'm just sharing my observations this would almost never happen in America or in Canada if you're in ring in Tech if it were to happen it would be extremely unusual and rare</p>
</details>

### 薪资与福利：预期与现实的落差

我敢打赌你没想到这一点：薪水比大多数人想象的要少。不知何故，我一直以为在阿联酋担任产品经理，即使不是高级或首席职位，也能轻松赚到1万美元（美元）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I bet you didn't expect this one it's less money than most people think for some reason I was under the impression that being a product manager in the uee you could make $10,000 American easily without having to be senior or principal</p>
</details>

我认为阿联酋在营销方面做得很好，在疫情前，你会听到人们搬到迪拜，房租由公司报销，或者公司支付汽车费用，或者公司支付酒店住宿费用等等。我个人认识一位2018年搬到那里的美国工程师，他的薪水是他在美国时的两到三倍，而且房租由公司承担。但这种情况已经改变了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the uee also has a very good marketing where in the preco times you would hear about people moving to Dubai and getting their rent reimbursed or the company paying for their car or the company paying for hotels accommodations all kinds of things I personally know an American engineer who moved there in 2018 was making either double or triple of his salary in the US and his rent was covered by the company that changed</p>
</details>

在面试中东大型科技公司的产品经理职位时，我能谈到的最高薪水是9.5万美元（美元），而且他们告诉我这已经对他们来说是很大的让步了。请记住，所有这些钱都是**免税**的——嗯，不是完全免税，只是**个人所得税**（Income Tax: 对个人收入征收的税）是0%。这肯定比你在加拿大或美国（加州以外）赚得多，但你的薪水也不会翻三倍。在美国，你可以在某些地方找到比这更高薪水且个人所得税较低的工作，例如华盛顿州和德克萨斯州。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when interviewing for a product manager at large Middle Eastern tech companies the most money I was able to negotiate was $95,000 American and I was told it would be a big stretch for them remember all of that money is taxfree well not taxfree it's just the income tax is 0% this is surely more than you'd make in Canada or in the US outside of California but it's not like your salaries going to Triple you can find places in the US where you'd be making more than that and have a low income tax example Washington State and Texas</p>
</details>

### 邀约变动与职位外包：合同的不确定性

我在阿联酋获得的四份工作邀约中，有三份与我们最初商定的条件不同，其中一份在我收到后的第二天就被撤销了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">out of four offers I was able to land in the UAE three were different from what we initially agreed upon and one got revoked the day after I got it</p>
</details>

对于那两份条件不同的邀约，当我收到时，薪资与我在面试初期协商的有所出入，明显更低，而且他们不愿意重新谈判。例如，有一家公司我协商的是每月1.1万美元，但实际只提供了9千美元。当我询问为何存在差异时，对方回答说他们会每年支付一次回家的机票，并且还会提供其他福利。支付机票费用在阿联酋是很常见的福利，许多地方都提供，但这并不能成为修改合同条件的理由。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">for the two that were different when I got the offer the salary in the offer was different than what I negotiated at the beginning of the interview process it was obviously lower and they would not be willing to renegotiate for instance there was one place where I negotiated 11,000 ,000 a month but got offered nine instead when I asked why there was a discrepancy the answer was would' be paying for your tickets home once a year and there are other perks that we'd be offering paying for tickets is a common perk in the UAE many places offer that but it doesn't justify contract augmentation</p>
</details>

那份被撤销的邀约是因为他们决定将该职位**外包**（Outsource: 将公司内部的业务或职能委托给外部的专业公司或个人）到另一个国家。他们外包的国家也在中东，那里有更便宜的工程师和产品经理。他们对此表示非常抱歉，但这种情况确实也会发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the offer that got revoked was because they decided to Outsource the role to a different country the country that they Outsource to is also in the Middle East they have cheaper engineers and cheaper PMS they were very apologetic about it but yet that happens too</p>
</details>

裁员并非北美独有的问题。在我面试期间，有几家公司因裁员而暂停招聘。所以，如果你认为这仅限于北美和欧洲，请记住，它在世界其他地区也同样普遍。在加拿大和美国，将工程和产品管理资源外包给拉丁美洲和印度是很常见的。而在阿联酋，他们更倾向于印度和埃及。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">layoffs is not only a North American problem as I was going through the interviews several companies put hiring and pause due to layoffs so if you think this is isolated to North America and Europe know that it's a common thing in other parts of the world as well in Canada in the US it is common to Outsource engineering and product management resources to Latin America and India in the UAE they prefer India and Egypt</p>
</details>

### 最终决定与给求职者的建议

我没有接受任何一份邀约，因为我认为以改变数月前讨论过的合同条件来开始一段职业关系，并不是一个好兆头。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I did not accept any of the offers because I thought that starting a professional relationship by changing the conditions in the contract that were discussed months ago was not a very good sign</p>
</details>

但我并不是在劝退任何人。对于那些希望在职业生涯中取得更大成就的人来说，这是一个绝佳的机会。但请记住，这是一个文化截然不同的地区，不要以你在北美对待面试流程的方式来对待它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but I'm not discouraging anybody from doing it it's a great opportunity for people who want to make more out of their career but keep in mind that it is a very different region with a very different culture and don't treat the interview process the way you treat it in North America</p>
</details>

如果你正在考虑移居中东，我强烈建议你考虑沙特阿拉伯，因为它至少目前还没有像阿联酋那样饱和。如果你在这个特定时期将金钱和投资置于生活中其他事情之上，这完全正常，我一直都是这样做的，那么沙特阿拉伯绝对值得考虑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">if you're considering moving to the Middle East I highly recommend exploring Saudi Arabia as it's not nearly saturated as the UAE at least for now if you're prioritizing money and Investments over other things in life at this particular point which is perfectly normal I do it all the time it's definitely worth considering</p>
