### 市场周初展望：感恩节前的平静与动荡

大家早上好，欢迎回到新一期的市场开盘直播。现在是周一早上，我们正式开始了十一月的最后一周，这感觉有点疯狂，因为大约七天后我们就要进入十二月了，甚至很难想象 2025 年即将结束。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. We are live. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning to everybody. We are here. It is Monday morning and we are officially starting off the last week of November which is kind of crazy because we're headed into December in about seven days and it's even hard to fathom that 2025 is coming to an end but nonetheless 2025 is coming to an end.</p>
</details>

希望大家周末过得愉快。我昨晚没有做周日期货节目，因为花了一些时间和家人在一起。下周也不会做，因为下周是感恩节周末。说实话，这将是交易清淡的一周，因为周四感恩节市场休市。周五虽然开市，但下午一点就收盘了，所以交易量会非常小。很多人显然都在旅行，所以我们只剩下周一、周二、周三这三天。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I hope everyone had a good weekend. I did not do the Sunday future show last night. I was spending some time with family. Also will not be doing it next week because next week is that Thanksgiving weekend. But we're here. It's going to be a bit of a light week to be honest because Thanksgiving Thursday markets closed. Friday you do have a market open but it closes at 1 p.m. So the volume is going to be very light. You have a lot of people that are obviously traveling and then you have Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.</p>
</details>

希望接下来的三天能让我们摆脱目前的下降趋势。如果有人还记得上周，尽管英伟达发布了史上最佳的第三季度财报，但市场带给我们的痛苦绝对不好受。市场至少可以说是动荡不安。所以希望本周我们能看到一些上涨趋势，或者至少是一些稳定。我认为，只要能在**标普500指数**（Standard & Poor's 500: 标准普尔500指数，一个衡量美国500家大型上市公司股票表现的指数）、比特币等资产上收复一些关键水平就很好了。比特币昨晚曾试图冲击一些价位，目前在86300美元，昨晚一度达到88000美元，当时你看到期货市场确实有所行动。尽管比特币相较几天前仍相对平稳，但期货市场依然是绿色的，虽然上周它确实触及了82000美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we have the next three days. Hopefully these next three days gets us out of this downtrend that we've been in. If anyone remembers last week, definitely wasn't pretty in terms of the pain that the markets took us through after the best earnings of all time on Nvidia's Q3. But still, the markets were choppy to say the least. So hopefully we can get a little bit of a uptrend this week or at least some stabilization. If anything, I think just reclaiming some of the key levels on the S&P 500, Bitcoin, etc., which tried to kind of make some levels last night. Bitcoin right now is at 86.3. had got up to 88 last night and that's when you saw futures really make a move. Future still green even though Bitcoin still relatively flat from where it was a couple days ago even though you know last week it did hit like 82,000.</p>
</details>

所以我认为，收复这些水平将非常有效，如果我们能做到并建立一点上升趋势，本周将会很令人兴奋。我们本周没有什么重大的财报，也没有什么疯狂的催化剂。当然，我们今天会讨论一些我看到的头条新闻，但第三季度基本上就这样了。我们已经结束了第三季度的财报季。虽然还有戴尔、Abercrombie、惠普、Workday、Zscaler、Zoom 等公司今天发布财报，还有 Clean Spark、Autodesk，但除此之外，没有太疯狂的消息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think just reclaiming some of those levels would be really effective and if we can reclaim some of those levels and set a little bit up of an uptrend it would be exciting for this week. And that's what we got. We don't have any crazy earnings. We don't have any crazy catalyst. I mean, we have some headlines that we'll discuss obviously today that I'm seeing right here, but nothing nothing more for Q3. I mean, we're basically ending out, we've ended out Q3. We've ended out Q3 earnings. We do have Dell and Abercrombie and HP, Workday, Zscaler, Zoom today, some of those earnings. Uh, Clean Spark, Autodesk, but outside of that, nothing too crazy.</p>
</details>

然后从十二月开始，我们将结束这一年的市场行情，从今天算起，市场还有最后六周时间来实现任何有意义的上涨。标普500指数今年迄今上涨了约12%。如果我们想实现连续三年20%的增长，我们需要在年底前的这六周内上涨约8%。目前标普500指数上涨了12.72%。也许会发生，也许不会。如果真的发生了，那将极大地帮助我们的投资组合回到十月份的水平。如果没有发生，我们至少能稳定下来，希望不要下跌。因为我认为最大的恐惧一直是，我们是否已经见顶，或者市场是否会继续回调？如果这两种情况都不发生，我认为那也将非常令人兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then starting in December, we are ending out the market and it is going to be the final six weeks from today for the market to be able to make any level of a meaningful run. S&P 500 is up about 12% year-to date. If we were to get those three back-to-back-to-back years of 20%, we would need about an 8% move towards the end of the year, which would be in the next six weeks. We're up 12.72% on the S&P 500. Maybe it happens, maybe it doesn't. If it does happen, it could really help a lot of our portfolios get back to some levels that it was at in October. if it doesn't and that we we at least stabilize and we don't hopefully go down because I think the biggest fear has been, you know, are we topping or is this, you know, time for the markets to continue to correct? If that doesn't happen, then I think that would be very exciting as well.</p>
</details>

好的，让我们进入正题。早上好，感谢大家来到这里。是的，请不要重演2018年12月的情景。我认为不会，因为今天早上我们听到了一些美联储的言论，比周四的要鸽派一些。周四，一群美联储主席出来说：“我们认为我们不会降息。”这通过利率概率得到了体现。我们现在的降息概率是77.9%，是三周以来的最高点。上周二这个数字还是30%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so let's get into it again. Good morning. Good morning. Thank you everybody for being here. Yes, please. Just not a repeat of December 2018. And I don't think there will be because we've got some Fed speak this morning. It's a little bit more to the dovish side than we had on Thursday. On Thursday, you had a bunch of Fed presidents come out and just say, "We do not think we're going to be cutting." And that is exemplified through rate probabilities. We're at 77.9, highest in three weeks. Highest in three weeks. This was 30% on Tuesday, last week.</p>
</details>

所以，我们能跳升到78%这个事实，以及许多新报告都暗示鲍威尔想要降息，他只需要确保有足够的票数来实现这次降息。但如果我们真的降息了，并且希望市场能从下跌趋势中修正过来，并可能稳定下来——我们今天会讨论很多这方面的原因——那么年底可能会有一个非常强劲的表现。是的，不再是抛硬币决定了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the facts that the fact that we got to jump up to 78. You got a lot of new reports saying signaling that Powell wants to cut and so he's just going to have to make sure he has enough votes to be able to get that cut. But if we do get that cut and you know hopefully the markets kind of correct from the sta from the from the downtrend and potentially stabilize and there's a lot of reasons why that we'll talk about today then maybe it could be a really strong strong end of year. Yeah. No longer a coin toss. No longer a coin toss.</p>

### 谷歌 Gemini 3.0 引发市场狂热

好了，我们开始吧。今天早上我们有很多头条新闻，我们会先从这些开始，然后再谈一些其他宏观大新闻。谷歌，哇，311美元。我整个盘前都没看谷歌。它在盘前交易中达到了311美元，上涨了4%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right let's get into it. So we got a bunch of headlines this morning that we'll start off with and then we'll we'll get into some of the other big macro news that we have. Google right here. Wow. 311. I have not looked at Google the entire pre-market. There it is. 311 in the pre-market. It's up 4%.</p>
</details>

周末期间，关于谷歌的消息层出不穷，其中很多都是对Gemini 3.0的赞誉。许多独立科技记者都站出来说，Gemini 3.0是货真价实的，这一点确实难以否认。此外，周四《The Information》也有一篇报道称，Sam Altman现在开始担心OpenAI的经济稳定性。这并不是说他对他们长期获胜没有信心，而是他确实表示，谷歌的新模型可能会在短期内造成一些经济逆风。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, there's a bunch of different things that came out on Google over the weekend. A lot of it being praised for Gemini 3.0. You had a lot of independent tech journalists just come out and say Gemini 3.0 is the real deal, and it's really hard to deny it. Uh, you also had that report on Thursday from the information saying that Sam Altman is now becoming worried about the economic stability of OpenAI. not that he's not confident that they're going to win in the long term, but that he did say Google's new model could create some economic headwinds in the short term.</p>
</details>

我想这就是为什么市场对谷歌越来越兴奋的原因。除此之外，Salesforce的首席执行官Marc Benioff也发了一条推文，我完全没想到他会这么做。我真的很惊讶他会公开发表这个。他发推文说，他每天都用ChatGPT，但现在他要转向Gemini 3了。我觉得这很奇怪，因为OpenAI不是付给Salesforce一大笔钱吗？你可能会觉得不应该得罪你最大的AI客户之一。但他写道：“天哪，我用了三年的ChatGPT。刚刚花了两个小时在Gemini 3上，我再也回不去了。这个飞跃太疯狂了。推理、速度、图像、视频，一切都更清晰、更快。感觉世界又一次改变了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and you know, I think that's why markets are getting a little bit more excited about Google. On top of that, you have Marc Benioff, who I did not expect him to tweet this. I really didn't. I was very like just surprised when he put this out there, but uh CEO of Salesforce, he tweeted that he uses Chat GBT every day and now he's switching to Gemini 3. And the reason I thought this was weird is because like doesn't OpenAI pay Salesforce a ton of money. Like you would you would think to not piss off one of your largest AI customers. But he says, "Holy [ __ ] I've used Chats every day for three years. Just spent two hours on Gemini 3. I'm not going back. The leap is insane. Reasoning speed, images, video, everything is sharper and faster. It feels like the world just changed again.</p>
</details>

也许Sundar付给Benioff的钱比Sam Altman多，这可能有点关系。但如果他只是发自内心地说Gemini就是那么好，那你就会看到越来越多的人对谷歌感到兴奋。所以，Gemini 3正在持续为谷歌带来巨大的推动力。这对整个AI行业来说也是一个巨大的利好，因为它再次向所有人证明了AI是真实存在的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Sundar probably pays Benioff more money than Sam Altman and maybe that had a little bit of a role there. But if he's just speaking from his heart and he's saying Gemini is just that much better. I mean, you're just seeing a lot more people get excited about Google. So there you go. Gemini 3 that is continuing to be a massive tailwind for Google. It's a really big tailwind for the broader AI trade because it's once again proving every people that proving to everybody that AI is very real.</p>
</details>

谷歌能够用自己的专有**TPU**（Tensor Processing Unit: 张量处理单元，谷歌为机器学习专门定制的集成电路）训练这些模型，并将其推向世界，现在还有了实际的应用案例。这让谷歌变得更具吸引力。我不知道谷歌是否还像当初在170、190甚至220美元时那样具有同样的风险回报比。我想伯克希尔·哈撒韦是在190到230美元的区间进入的。它并没有变得非常非常昂贵，但绝对不再是白菜价了。如果你在寻找那样的机会，Meta可能是更合适的选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and Google being able to train these models on their own proprietary TPUs and get it out there into the world and now have it have real use cases. That is something that's making Google a lot more attractive. I don't know if Google is the same risk-reward that it was obviously back at 170, 190, even 220. I think Berkshire got in around that 190 to 230 range. I mean, it's not getting super super expensive, but it's definitely not getting dirt cheap anymore. If that if that's something you're looking for, Meta is probably the one that pops up instead.</p>
</details>

所以，我好奇市场还能让它持续上涨多久，并给予它溢价。感觉年底收盘价接近或超过300美元是非常有可能的。要达到350美元，你今天看到一些分析师的目标价是415美元。Wedbush的目标价是400美元。如果它真的进入350美元区间，那将是相当惊人的。这意味着在不到四个月的时间里翻了一倍多。这也是谷歌如此令人兴奋的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I wonder how long the market, you know, is able to continue giving it a run and giving it a premium. It definitely feels like end of year close by 300 or close over 300 is very possible to get up to 350. You got some 415 analyst targets today. I mean, Wed Bush has 400. If that thing does get into the 350s, it would be quite incredible. It would be more than a double in less than four months. And that's why it's also very exciting for Google.</p>

### 医疗保健板块异动：诺和诺德受挫，奥斯卡健康因特朗普新政飙升

关于诺和诺德和奥斯卡健康，我们有一些关于这两家公司的新闻。不幸的是，诺和诺德在阿尔茨海默病试验结果失败后下跌了10%。诺和诺德报告称其阿尔茨海默病药物试验结果失败，表示未能达到其主要目标。该研究测试了司美格鲁肽（semaglutide），也就是用于Ozempic和Wegovy的相同成分，看它是否能减缓阿尔茨海默病的进展。在两个独立的试验中，生物标志物有所改善，但这种改善并未转化为任何疾病进展的延迟。不幸的是，诺和诺德因此受到了打击。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh Novo and Oscar. So we got some news on those two. Oscar unfortunately is down or sorry Novo is down 10% after failed Alzheimer trials results. Novonordisk reported failed results for his Alzheimer's drug trial saying it did not meet its main goal. The study tested semiglutide the same ingredient used in Ozempic and Wegovy to see if it could slow Alzheimer progression. Biomarkers improved in two separate trials but the improvement did not translate into any delay in disease progression. Unfortunately, Novo is getting hit right there.</p>
</details>

实际上，诺和诺德上周凭借与礼来的合作关系，股价有所上涨。问题在于，他们药物管线的其他部分尚未得到有意义的保障，或者至少没有向市场展示出催化剂。你可以看到诺和诺德下跌了9.85%，这就是它受挫的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And Novo was actually making a bit of a run with the Eli Lilly partnership they had last week. The problem is the other parts of their drug pipeline have not been meaningfully uh secured or at least shown to the market that there's a catalyst right there. You can see 9.85% on Novo and that's why that one is getting hit.</p>
</details>

再说一次，阿尔茨海默病是一个很难取得任何进展来解决的疾病。所以诺和诺德为此努力是非常重要的。只是在市场上，如果资本流向了他们认为能够真正解决问题的公司，而问题即使在短期内没有得到解决，你知道，也许长期来看诺和诺德能找到办法，但短期内你会看到股价下跌。这就是我们现在在诺和诺德上看到的，它下跌了10%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now again, like Alzheimer's is a really hard thing to even get any progress to resolve. So the fact that Novo is trying for this is so important. It's just in the market, you know, if capital is going to companies that they think can actually resolve the issue and the issue doesn't get resolved even in the short term. You know, maybe long term Novo figures it out, you're going to see you're going to see a move to the downside. And that's what we're seeing right here on Novo. That's down 10%.</p>
</details>

在医疗保健行业的另一端，奥斯卡健康（Oscar Health）上涨了20%。哇，我上次看的时候还只涨了10%，现在已经涨了20%了。奥斯卡健康之所以上涨20%，是因为它的生死存亡都与**ACA**（Affordable Care Act: 平价医疗法案，也被称为奥巴马医改，旨在扩大美国医疗保险覆盖范围的联邦法规）补贴息息相关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On the opposite side of the healthcare industry, Oscar is up 20. Wow. It was up 10% last time I checked. Now it's up 20%. All right. So Oscar is up 20%. The reason Oscar is up 20% is because you live with the ACA subsidies and you die with the ACA subsidies.</p>
</details>

根据Politico今天的报道，特朗普可能将就此发布一项行政命令，有传言称他将这么做。特朗普正准备推出一个新的ACA框架，其中包括将下个月到期的奥巴马医改补贴（即ACA补贴）延长两年。该计划将对资格设置收入上限，大约是联邦贫困线的700%，并引入最低保费支付。它还呼吁国会为成本分摊减免提供资金，并为参保人提供一个选项，如果他们转换到更低保费的计划，可以将部分税收抵免存入储蓄账户。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So based on what Politico is reporting today, and maybe we're going to see an executive order from Trump on this, there was some rumors that he was going to be doing an executive order. Uh Trump is preparing to roll out a new ACA framework per Politico, including a two-year extension of Obamacare subsidies, aka ACA subsidies, that expire next month. The plan would add income gaps on eligibility of roughly 700% of the federal poverty line and introduce minimum premium payments. It also calls for Congress to fund cost sharing reductions and offers an an option for enrollees to take part of their tax credit into a savings account if they switch to a a lower premium plan.</p>
</details>

这有点符合特朗普的座右铭，即让人民选择自己的医疗保健，而不是让机构为他们选择。他一直坚持认为，独立性应该是医疗保健框架的一个关键部分，看起来他的计划也将试图加入这一点。Politico报道称，白宫正试图在预期保费飙升之前采取行动，因为两党都在辩论如何处理补贴到期的最后期限。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kind of going into Trump's motto of letting the people choose their healthcare versus letting the institutions kind of choose it for him. He's really been on this idea that independence should be a sort of key part of the healthcare framework and it looks like that's what his plan will be trying to add. Political reporting that the White House is aiming to get ahead of the expected premium spikes as both parties debate how to handle the subsidy deadline.</p>
</details>

这件事之所以如此重要，还因为如果民主党人以某种方式同意这项提议，并支持这种补贴延期，我们可能在一月份就不会有政府关门了。我并不了解医疗保健的所有内部细微差别，我敢肯定特朗普的这个提议中，有些东西从民主党的角度来看可能是不好的，甚至可能对共和党来说也不是最好的。但如果它在双方看来都有好有坏，也许就足以达成协议，让他们在一月份避免政府关门。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other reason this is really important is because if the Democrats somehow agree to this and they are on board with this type of subsidy extension um we might not have a a shutdown in January. So I do not understand all the internal nuances of healthcare. I'm sure there's things with this proposal from Trump that are probably bad for the Democrat's perspective, probably not even the best for the Republicans perspective, but if it's enough of bad on both sides and somewhat good on both sides, maybe it's enough of an agreement to get them to not shut down the government in January.</p>
</details>

所以，这确实是他提出的一个非常重要的政治框架，希望国会能对此给予一些支持。但显然，像奥斯卡这样的公司股价会因此上涨，因为如果你延长了这些补贴，奥斯卡会非常喜欢。盘前交易中，股价从13美元涨到16.30美元，涨幅20.7%。这只股票之前因为不知道补贴会发生什么而从22美元跌到了13美元。如果情况更加明朗，它很容易就能涨回去。联合健康集团（UNH）上涨了2.29%。几乎所有的医疗保健股都在上涨。Elevance Health上涨了3.3%，奥斯卡上涨了20%，联合健康上涨了2.29%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, this really is a very important political framework that he's putting out there and hopefully there's some support in Congress around it. But obviously a company like Oscar is going to make a move because if you have an extension of those subsidies, that's where Oscar is going to really like it. 20.7% 13 to 1630 in the pre-market. Again, this stock went from 22 to 13 because of the pain of not knowing what's going to happen with the subsidy. It could easily run back up if there's more clarity. UNH is up 2.29%. Pretty much all of the um healthcare names are getting a bid right here. Elevance right there, that's also up 3.3%. and Oscar again up 20%, UNH up 2.29.</p>
</details>

### 政治风向：特朗普与民主党人的意外和解

我们将看看事态如何发展，但至少在这方面取得了一些进展，这很好。而且，这也许不是特朗普的妥协。有人可能会说，这只是他认识到民主党和共和党必须以某种方式就此达成一致，所以他才提出了这样的框架。但这发生在他与穆拉德·莫马尼先生（Murad Momani）一次相对友好的会面之后。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, we're going to see how that one ends up playing out, but it is nice to at least get some progress on that. And, you know, it follows and you know, maybe I don't know if this is necessarily capitulation by Trump. One could argue that it's just him recognizing that there has to be some way for the Democrats or Republicans to agree on this, which is why he's proposing this type of a framework. But it comes after a relatively friendly meeting with Mr. Murad Momani.</p>
</details>

我认为周末的故事是关于特朗普和莫马尼之间有多么友好，我想很多人都没想到。但我觉得，这段视频恰好突显了特朗普和莫马尼的互动方式。正如你在这里看到的，当大门关闭时，他们互相说着严厉的话，在推特上互相攻击。然后当大门打开时，不，他们很冷静，他们非常友好。这正是当时的感觉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the story over the weekend was how um nice Trump and Momani were to each other, which I don't think a lot of people expected. Um but I mean, this is a video that I think highlights exactly how Trump and Momani acted with each other. So, as you can see right here, when the gate closes, there's uh tough tough words and Twitter fingers being thrown at each other. And then when the gate opens, no, they're they're chill. They're really nice. This is exactly what it felt like.</p>
</details>

当莫马尼被问到，“嘿，莫马尼，你说特朗普是个法西斯主义者，对此你怎么说？”特朗普说：“别担心，你只要说是就行了，你甚至不用解释。”上周看到这一幕真是超现实。也许他们俩共同拥有一种民粹主义议程，而这种议程创造了他们在会面时都表现出的那种兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the reason it felt like that moment Trump where where Momani is asked about, hey, Trump, you know, or Manny, hey, you said he's Trump's a fascist. Like, what do you say about that? And Trump's like, don't worry about it. You can just say yes. You don't even have to explain yourself. I mean, this was surreal seeing this last week. Maybe there is a little bit of a uh maybe there is a little bit of a a sort of populist agenda that both of them have together and that populist agenda is creating the level of excitement that they both had um kind of on on that meeting together.</p>
</details>

你原以为会有一些“抓到你了”的时刻，你以为他们会互相攻击。我们看到了特朗普在二月份在椭圆形办公室与泽连斯基的互动。我原以为会是类似的情景，特朗普哭诉他是共产主义者，而莫马尼则当面说特朗普是法西斯主义者，然后他们会来回争论。但结果恰恰相反。他们说：“不不不，我们都想关注纽约人的生活成本问题。”他们俩的回答都很好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean again you you thought there would be some gotcha moments. You thought there would be moments where they both kind of go back and forth with each other. We saw what Trump did with Zelenskyy back uh back back in February when he was at the Oval Office. I kind of thought it would be something like that and Trump just, you know, crying that he's a communist and Momani saying that Trump's a fascist both to each other's faces and going back and forth, but it was the opposite. It was like, "No, no, no. We both want to focus on affordability for New Yorkers." They both had some really good answers.</p>
</details>

然后特朗普周六去海湖庄园的路上，他们继续问他这件事，他说：“不，他喜欢莫马尼。他只会在莫马尼需要的时候才会派国民警卫队去纽约。”这是一次非常友好的会面。所以也许我们在共和党和民主党如何合作方面正在翻开新的一页。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then Trump when he was going on his way to Mar-a-Lago on Saturday, they continued to ask him about it and he said, "No, he likes Momani. He'll only send the National Guard to New York if Momani needs it." Like it was a very amicable meeting. And so maybe we're turning a little bit of a page in terms of how the Republicans and Democrats are going to work together.</p>
</details>

我想特朗普可能明白，生活成本问题需要解决。在2024年的纽约州选举中，他虽然没有非常接近获胜，但比2020年有了更好的机会。所以他知道纽约有更多的人关心他。他们投票给他的部分原因就是生活成本危机。第三，特朗普可能知道他们无法再承受一次政府关门。如果我们再次政府关门，中期选举的结果可能会对共和党不利。所以，也许特朗普正试图抢先一步，开始与民主党合作，至少在某种程度上与他们搞好关系，这样我们就不必在一月份再次政府关门，这显然对整个国家都有利。

<p class="english-text">And I think Trump probably understands, hey, the affordability stuff needs to get fixed. Um New York, he was he wasn't like super close to winning it in 2024, but there was a lot better chance uh from 2020. So he, you know, he does know that there are more people in New York that do care about him. And part of the reason they voted for him was because of the affordability crisis. And number three, he he Trump probably knows they can't survive another shutdown. If we get another shutdown, I mean, there's a world where the midterms go the opposite direction for the Republicans. So, maybe Trump is trying to get ahead of that and start working with the Democrats and at least getting on their good side in some capacity so that we don't have to have another shutdown in January, which obviously would be beneficial for for the entire country.</p>

### 英伟达深度解析：回调是机会还是陷阱？

上周英伟达发布了有史以来最好的财报之一。我整个周末都在思考，试图更多地了解英伟达的情况。我的结论是，我认为英伟达的抛售非常愚蠢。如果我们再次看到更大幅度的抛售，进入那个区间——上周我们曾短暂触及172美元——如果我们再次接近175美元或170美元低位，虽然考虑到一些价格走势我认为我们不会，但市场随时可能反转。我认为英伟达值得买入。

<details>

<p class="english-text">okay, so let's talk about um Nvidia. So I mean last week Nvidia had one of the best earnings ever. I've done a lot of thinking over the weekend to try to understand a lot more about what's going on with Nvidia. I have concluded I think the sell off on Nvidia is really stupid and I think if we see a more substantial selloff once again into that I mean we got 172 for a little bit last week. If we get anywhere near 175 the low 170s again which I don't think we will given some of the price action but then again that could happen any second if the market flips. I think Nvidia is a buy.</p>
</details>

上周我没有买任何英伟达的股票。我当时在努力整理思绪，思考这是否是一个简单的买入机会，或者我是否忽略了什么。唯一存在的论点是关于**GPU**（Graphics Processing Unit: 图形处理器，最初用于渲染图像，现已成为 AI 计算的核心硬件）折旧的问题，顺便说一下，提出这个论点的人，Michael Burry，昨天有一个公告，我们稍后会谈到。那个公告似乎不足以让我们对英伟达的现状感到非常非常害怕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I didn't buy any Nvidia last week. I was trying to really collect my thoughts on like, hey, is this, you know, a simple thing to buy? Is there something I'm overlooking? And it really like the only argument that's there is the GPU depreciation stuff, which by the way, the guy who started that argument, Michael Burry had a announcement yesterday that we'll talk about. And it doesn't feel like that announcement is enough to be super super scared of what's going on with Nvidia.</p>
</details>

如果你相信Gemini 3.0，如果你相信Waymo，相信FSD，相信人形机器人，相信所有这些存在的整体论点，那么就很难说“我要做空英伟达”。我想一两年后，当英伟达的市值接近7到8万亿美元时，我们会对此一笑置之。顺便说一句，美国银行重申了其275美元的买入目标价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, if you believe in Gemini 3.0, know if you believe in Waymo, you believe in FSD, you believe in humanoid robotics, you believe in that overall thesis that is there, it's just very very very hard to be like, I'm going to fade Nvidia. And I think we're going to be laughing about this a year or two years from now with Nvidia closer to a 7 to 8 trillion dollar market cap. Bank of America, by the way, reiterated their buy target at 275.</p>
</details>

他们的论点是，人们不应该像现在这样担心。市场的大部分担忧都集中在营运资本趋势上，但美国银行表示，对应收账款和库存增加的担忧是错误的。他们写道：“重要的不是应收账款的绝对数字，而是它们与销售额的比较”，并指出销售周转天数从54天下降到了53天。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And their argument was just like people should not be as concerned as they are. Much of the market concern is centered on working capital trends, but Bank of America said worries about rising receivables inventories are misplaced. They wrote, "It's not the absolute receivable number. It's them compared to sales, noting that day sales outstanding declined to 53 days versus 54 days."</p>
</details>

关于库存，很多人都很担心，美国银行解释说，这与英伟达的规模以及更复杂系统的出货量有关，包括Blackwell、GB200和GB300 MBL72机架。他们引用道：“考虑到Blackwell级别平台六个月的部署周期，如果英伟达的库存没有快速增长，我们才会更担心。”换句话说，他们认为库存增加是因为需求仍然超过供应，他们需要储备这些库存以赶上供应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On inventories, which a lot of people have been concerned about, Bank of America explained that Nvidia scale and shipments of more complex systems, including the Blackwell, GB200, and GB300 MBL72 racks. That quote, "We would be more worried if Nvidia inventory wasn't growing fast given the six-month deployment cycle for Blackwell class platforms." aka they're saying inventory is going up because demand is still outstripping supply and they need to be able to backstop that inventory in order to catch up with that supply.</p>
</details>

英伟达在24倍、18倍的2026年或2027年市盈率下仍然具有吸引力，而其销售和每股收益增长率为40%，他们敦促投资者忽略季度的噪音。

### 激辩 GPU 折旧：戳破 Michael Burry 的“会计阴谋论”

我不知道。显然，有一种观点认为谷歌的TPU和亚马逊的训练芯片已经问世。我这个周末看了一些视频，试图更多地了解这些其他超大规模数据中心正在部署的定制ASIC芯片。这些都是真实存在的，它们最终可能会给英伟达带来一些利润压力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know. I I I mean I obviously there's an argument that you know the Google TPUs are out there, Amazon is their training tips. actually watched a couple videos this weekend just trying to understand more about the the custom ASICs that some of these other hyperscalers are deploying and those are real things they will probably put some margin pressure on Nvidia eventually but</p>
</details>

但根据我们得到的数据，以及英伟达预测的毛利率扩张，真的很难对英伟达的现状感到非常害怕。再说一次，那4500亿美元的上涨和逆转，基本上是在两个小时内发生的，感觉就像很多人开始担心库存、应收账款、GPU折旧或其他什么让市场有点不爽的事情，然后引发了我们看到的系统性抛售，再加上美联储更鹰派的言论。如果这些担忧不是真的，那么英伟达不一定要明天就涨到10万亿美元，但认为英伟达必须跌到3万亿美元，成为过去一年市值停滞的公司之一，而不是在他们以如此速度增长的情况下维持突破，这想法就有点奇怪了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">based on the data we're getting I mean and based on the gross margin expansion that Nvidia guided for it is very very very hard to be super scared about what's going on with Nvidia and again that 450 billion uptick in the reversal that we had in the span of basically two hours uh that felt like a lot of people started to get concerned about inventories or accounts receivables or GPUs depreciation or something that just made the market a bit more upset and then that caused the sort of systemic selling that we saw along with the Fed speak that was a bit more hawkish. If those concerns aren't real, I mean again, Nvidia doesn't have to shoot up to 10 trillion tomorrow, but the idea that Nvidia has to go down to three trillion and become, you know, one of those companies that uh it stay it stayed at in terms of market cap over the past year instead of sort of sustaining the breakout even though they're growing at the level that they're growing at.</p>
</details>

如果英伟达继续预测明年增长超过35%会怎样？他们下个季度还会增长50-60%。到某个时候，市场会希望把资本投到他们知道会持续增长的地方，而英伟达的增长并没有放缓。所以，我不知道我们是否会回到170美元的低位。我只是觉得，再买一点是值得的。我上周没有买，但周末我找不到足够有说服力的理由来对英伟达感到那么害怕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, what happens if Nvidia continues to guide for upwards of 35% growth next year? They're going to grow another 50 60% next quarter. It's like at some point you would also like the the market wants to put capital to use where they know that it will continue to grow and Nvidia is not slowing down the growth. So I I don't know if we get back into the low 170s. I just feel like it's it's worth taking another nibble. I didn't nibble last week, but I just couldn't find enough of a compelling reason over the weekend to be that scared of Nvidia.</p>
</details>

这是David Friedberg在All-In播客上解释为什么Michael Burry关于GPU的论点不一定正确。我认为Michael Burry这次搞错了。Michael Burry说的是，所有这些超大规模数据中心都将他们数据中心的折旧年限或使用寿命延长了大约两倍，这使得他们在财报中报告的运营成本减半，从而夸大了他们的收益。所以他声称他们在做假账。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This was uh David Friedberg on the All-In podcast this weekend explaining why the GPU argument by Michael Burry was not necessarily correct. And I actually think Michael Burry's got this wrong. And so what Michael Burry is saying is that all of these hyperscalers have extended their depreciation schedule or the useful life of their data centers by roughly 2x which cuts the operating costs in half when they report it in earnings. And so it's making their earnings inflate. So he's claiming they're cooking the books.</p>
</details>

谷歌在21年第一季度首次做出了这一改变，他们说服务器的使用年限从3年延长到4年。图表显示了服务器和网络设备的组合。另外，在2021年，谷歌将网络设备的使用年限从3年延长到5年，然后在2023年又从5年延长到6年。这是他们进行分析后努力的结果。那么数据中心发生了什么？数据中心从主要是数据存储和数据传输系统——使用硬盘和内存来存储数据然后传输出去——转变为数据处理中心，这是因为AI的繁荣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Google first made this change in Q1 of 21 where they said the servers are now going from 3 to four years. The chart shows the combination of servers and networking equipment. Separately in 2021, Google took networking equipment from three to five years and then in 2023 they took it from five to six years. And so this is a result of this effort where they went in and did an analysis. So what happened? What happened in the data centers is that the data centers transitioned from being primarily data storage and data transfer systems where you would use hard drives and RAM and memory to store data and then transmit it back out to being data processing centers because of the AI boom.</p>
</details>

随着AI在数据中心变得越来越重要，投入数据中心的资金更多地被分配给了芯片，而不是最初的硬盘等数据存储设备。当你把这些处理器放进去处理数据以进行AI运算时，这成了主要的开销，大部分能源都用在了处理器上。我打了几个电话，和一些朋友核实了一下，每个人都说同样的话，那些在数据中心里放了七八年的TPU和GPU仍在使用，而且使用率达到了100%。这实际上证明并验证了折旧年限应该更长而不是更短。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So as AI became more important in the data center, more of the dollars that are going into data centers were allocated towards chips from data storage which initially was hard drives. And then suddenly when you put these processors in to process the data to do AI, that's the majority of the spend and the majority of the energy is going towards the processors. I made some calls and I checked around with some other friends and everyone says the same thing that these seven and 8-year-old TPUs and GPUs that are sitting in the data centers are still being used and they're being used at 100% utilization. So that actually justifies and validates the depreciation schedule being much longer versus shorter.</p>
</details>

我认为这就是为什么有些人对这种关于折旧的论点持怀疑态度的原因。这并不是说这个论点不值得探讨。但是，就像Jensen在电话会议上说的，如果你有英伟达六年前出货的A100芯片仍在这些数据中心被使用，那么它们的折旧年限并没有被低估到会夸大收益的程度，这意味着Burry的论点可能不正确。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think that's why uh you have some people calling BS on this argument about depreciation. It's not that it's an argument that shouldn't be explored. But you know, and Jensen said it on the call, if you have A100 chips that Nvidia shipped six years ago that are still being utilized in these data centers, then the depreciation schedule on them is not understated to the fact that it would overstate the earnings, which means Burry, you know, might not have this argument correct.</p>
</details>

顺便说一下，另一个头条新闻是谷歌股价在盘前上涨的原因：北约和谷歌云签署了一项价值数百万美元的协议，用于建设支持AI的**主权AI**（Sovereign AI: 指一个国家建立和部署自己的人工智能基础设施和大型语言模型的能力，以确保数据主权和国家安全）云。Jensen一直以来都在谈论主权AI将变得越来越重要。主权AI不仅需要独立的国家和主权国家拥有自己的GPU和数据中心，还需要他们拥有自己的云计算。因此，谷歌赢得了一项数百万美元的协议，这对北约来说显然是一项重要的交易，而且随着北约用例的扩展，这项交易可能会扩大，他们可能会从谷歌购买更多的云计算服务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This other headline, by the way, is why Google's pumping in the premarket. NATO and Google Cloud signed a multi-million dollar deal for AI enabled sovereign cloud. Jensen's been talking about a long time for this sovereign AI to continue becoming a bigger deal. Sovereign AI is not only going to need independent countries and sovereign nations uh that have their own GPUs that have their own data centers, but they're also going to need their own cloud computing. And so Google winning a multi-million exact number, but multi-million dollar deal for NATO. Obviously that is an important deal and that deal probably will expand as NATO's use cases expand and as those use cases expand you know they will probably buy more cloud compute from Google.</p>

### 华尔街观点：分析师激辩 AI 泡沫与市场前景

Michael Burry要宣布的大事已经揭晓了。他正式加入了**Substack**（一个允许写作者直接通过订阅邮件列表向读者收费的在线平台）。就是这样。这就是他一直预告的11月25日的大公告。订阅他的Substack每年需要380美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The big announcement that Mike Burry Michael Burry uh was going to make um it's out. It is officially a Substack. He is joining Substack. So that is it. That's the big November 25th announcement that he's been teasing. It's $380 a year to subscribe to his Substack.</p>
</details>

他费了这么多周折只是为了推出一个Substack，这有点好笑。你看，我从事内容创作，我喜欢表达想法并将其公之于众，希望能创作出引人入胜的故事和有趣的思想。只是，他为了开一个Substack，预热了那么久。你还以为这家伙会在11月25日曝光一些关于英伟达的惊天大料。结果，不，只是一个Substack，这也没什么。也许他不想再管理资金了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It it is it is kind of funny that he he went through all of this just to launch a Substack, which look, I like I'm in the content creation game. I I I love the ability to express ideas and put it out there and hopefully create compelling stories and interesting thoughts and ideas. It's just I don't know. He went through a lot of teasing to just start a Substack. Like you thought this guy was going to like expose something crazy about Nvidia on November 25th. It's like no, it's a it's a Substack, which is fine. Maybe he doesn't want to uh manage money anymore.</p>
</details>

另外，如果你对AI是泡沫的论点如此深信不疑，难道你不想管理大量资金去做空，然后赚大钱吗？这不就是重点吗？如果你不愿意像2008年那样动用客户资金去做空，你真的有那么大的信念吗？因为他就是那样出名的，对吧？他动用了客户的资金，那些客户甚至不希望他用他们的钱，但他有完全的自主权。他去做了空头，结果他是对的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Also, by the way, if you're so convicted on your thesis on AI being a bubble, wouldn't you want to manage a lot of money and go short and then make a ton of money? Like, isn't that the whole like, do you really have that much conviction if you're not willing to use client capital and go short like you did in 2008? Because that's how he made his name, right? He used client capital and those clients didn't even want him to use their capital, but he had full discretion over it. And he went short and he ended up being right.</p>
</details>

有很多分析师站出来说：“嘿，你知道，这个AI泡沫的说法，听听很重要，但它并不是决定经济走向的因素。”看看彭博社关于**ETF**（Exchange-Traded Fund: 交易所交易基金，一种在证券交易所交易、跟踪特定指数、商品或资产组合的投资基金）的更新。上周，每天有80亿美元的净流入。先锋集团（Vanguard）在这80亿美元中占了30亿，是他们正常吸纳量的两倍，今年迄今已达3500亿美元。VOO，也就是更广泛的市场指数基金，今年已经吸纳了1200亿美元。所以在上周所有的抛售中，无论是算法抛售、散户恐慌性抛售还是系统性抛售，机构都在买入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you have a lot of these analysts coming out and just saying, "Hey, you know, this AI bubble talk, it's like important to listen to it, but it is not the defining factor of what's going on in the economy." Take a look at Bloomberg's update with ETFs. Last week, $8 billion a day of net inflows continue to come in. Vanguard was three billion of the eight billion a day, doubling their normal take, now 350 billion year to date. VOO which again is just the broader market 120 billion on the year. So in the midst of all of the selling last week all of the whether it was algorithmic selling retail panic selling systematic selling institutions were buying.</p>
</details>

摩根士丹利的Mike Wilson表示，当前股市的压力是由美联储流动性紧张引发的战术性回调，而非基本面恶化。表面之下的损害表明，回调已接近尾声。Wilson仍然非常看好后市，预计美联储将降息，并预测2026年每股收益（EPS）将增长17%。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And that's what Mike Wilson from Morgan Stanley says.

The damage under the surface suggests the correction is nearing its end. Wilson remains highly bullish, expecting the Fed to cut rates and forecasting 17% EPS growth in 2026.</p>
</details>

Fundstrat的Mark Newton则认为市场仍将震荡。他指出，科技股与市场其他部分之间出现了明显的分化。他认为，市场讨厌不确定性，而关于美联储是否降息的猜测正是这种不确定性的体现。他预计市场可能会反弹，但除非看到更多板块参与上涨，否则很难说会“一飞冲天”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Fundstrat's Mark Newton, and here's his argument for what to expect towards the end of November. Everybody, uh, look, I think it's less about the day-to-day volatility and more about the fact that we've seen a meaningful divergence between technology and the rest of the market. And that started, you know, right around July. So tech had gone straight higher whereas the rest of the market had largely gone sideways and not participated. As to what's to come, you know, my thinking is it's going to be a little choppier. Uh it's certainly an unorthodox uh time for markets to be going down down or and or sideways, but you know, a lot of it is about lining up, you know, the expectations of when the next Fed cut is. They say the market hates uncertainty. That's true with regards to, you know, whether or not we're going to cut or not. it's tough for me to say it's going to be off to the races until we start to see more evidence of more and more sectors starting to participate in this rally and not just technology.</p>
</details>

从根本上看，这也是我们今天早上看这些股票分析师时的主题，情况并没有真正恶化。故事似乎更多的是，你知道，上周我认为AI交易的疲惫感正在显现。由于这种疲惫，市场只是获利了结并抛售。当然，美联储关于不降息的言论也是一个大问题。但这种疲惫最终会转化为想要寻找投资去处的资金。当你看到Meta的市盈率只有19倍时，市场可能很容易对此感到兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Fundamentally, and this is what kind of the theme has been all morning as we've been looking at to some of these equity analysts. Fundamentally, it's not really um a deteriorating story. The story seems to be more just, you know, you know what I thought also happened last week, I think exhaustion of the AI trade was taking place last week. And as a result of that exhaustion, you just had markets kind of take their profits and sell off. And obviously the Fed talk with the with the lack of rate cuts was a big deal. But that exhaustion will eventually turn into money that wants to find a place to go to work. And when you have Meta trading at 19 times earnings, I mean, that might be an easy place for the market to get excited for.</p>

### 宏观大局：美联储、通胀与地缘政治风险

一些宏观数据。高盛昨天表示，美国养老基金预计将在月底购买130亿美元的美国股票，这是自4月份以来的首次大额预估。所以，美国养老基金要开始多买一些了。美联储的沃勒（Waller）自上次美联储会议以来变得更加鸽派。他表示，现有数据表明变化不大，在劳动力市场如此疲软的情况下，通胀不是大问题。他继续申明，他更关心劳动力市场而不是通胀。

Expands access to AWS's trusted infrastructure and comprehensive AI services to help government agencies advance AI leadership.</p>

兄弟，我们在这里谈论的是什么？这东西没有放缓。为政府云投资500亿美元。今天，亚马逊宣布投资高达500亿美元，为亚马逊网络服务（AWS）的美国政府客户扩展AI和超级计算能力。这项投资将使政府机构能够通过将模拟和建模数据与AI集成，加速发现和决策过程。各机构可以在几小时内完成曾经需要数周甚至数月的工作，通过自主实验引导和实时反馈循环实现。好的，这很重要。这非常、非常、非常重要。我认为市场立即看到了这一动态并感到兴奋。

<p class="english-text">Yeah, bro, what are we talking about here? What are we talking about? This stuff is not slowing down. 50 billion for government cloud. Today, Amazon announced an an investment up to 50 billion to expand AI and supercomputing capabilities for Amazon web services, US government customers. This investment will enable government agencies to accelerate discovery and decision-making by integrating simulation and modeling data with AI agencies can achieve in hours what once took weeks and months through autonomous experimental steering and realtime feedback loops. Okay, this matters. This deeply, deeply, deeply matters. And I think the market immediately seeing that move is getting excited.</p>

### Mike Wilson 的牛市论：为何说经济衰退已经过去？

我认为Mike Wilson的分析最有道理。我真的认为他的分析最有道理。而且我认为这就是为什么你看到很多分析师出来变得更加看涨的原因。他看涨的论点与Tom Lee非常相似，即他认为经济衰退已经在四月份发生，并且他们认为一个新的牛市正在开始。

<p class="english-text">Dude, I think Mike Wilson's analysis makes the most sense. Like I really do think his analysis makes the most sense. And I think that's why you're leading to a lot of these analysts coming out and being more bullish. His argument for being bullish is very similar to Tom Lee which is that he thinks a recession already happened in April and they think a new bull market is beginning.</p>

Mike Wilson的论点很简单：只要美联储提供流动性，并且**资本支出**（Capital Expenditure: 资本支出，指公司用于购买、维护或升级固定资产（如设备、建筑）的资金）不下降，这就是一个牛市，你应该忽略所有的噪音，如果你认为美联储将放松政策并且超大规模数据中心将继续支出。

<p class="english-text">And again, I think a lot of that makes sense with Wilson's analysis, which is as long as the Fed comes through with liquidity and the capex doesn't go down, this is a bull market, you ignore all the noise, if you think the Fed's going to be easing and the hyperscalers are going to be spending.</p>

我周末也思考了另一件事。我就想，我们仍然不知道所有可能发生的好事，即使它们需要数年时间才能显现出来。你怎么能抛售引领这些新机遇的AI行业呢？然后，你怎么能抛售这个行业中的赢家，比如英伟达，它们是实现这一切的关键？所以，这归结为一个定性的理解，你是否相信像药物发现在未来五年会变得更好？如果会，那么英伟达就很重要；如果不会，那么我猜你就卖掉英伟达。但如果你有一个更乐观的看法，感觉你应该做多那些股票。

<p class="english-text">that's another thing I was thinking about over the weekend. I was like, we still don't know all the good things that could happen even if it takes years for it to manifest itself. How do you sell off the sector AI that is leading to those new opportunities? And then how do you sell off the winners in that sector like Nvidia that are the lynch pin of any of that stuff becoming real? So it comes down to a qualitative understanding of if you believe that like drug discovery is going to be better in the next five years because if it is Nvidia matters if it doesn't then I guess you sell Nvidia. But if you have a more optimistic view it feels like you should be long those names</p>

你可能不喜欢我的答案，但这对我来说不重要，因为最终市场会告诉美联储该怎么做。我一直是这么看的。人们讨厌这个观点，但我是个市场人，好吗？市场主导一切。市场告诉投资者该怎么做，对吧？所以市场会，你知道，迫使他们出手。如果市场认为需要更多流动性，它们会迫使美联储出手。如果市场认为需要更多降息，它会迫使他们出手，因为我们现在已经变得如此金融化了，对吧？美联储现在基本上有义务在某种程度上确保我们有金融稳定。

<p class="english-text">You're probably not going to like my answer, but it doesn't matter be to me because ultimately the market's going to tell the Fed what to do. I mean, that's my general that's always been my view. People hate it, but like I'm a markets person, okay? The markets dominate. The markets tell investors what to do, right? So the markets will, you know, kind of force their hand. If it if the markets believe they need more liquidity, they will force the Fed's hand. If the market believes it needs more rate cuts, it will force their hand because we become so financialized at this point, right? The Fed now is basically obligated to make sure that we have financial stability to some degree.</p>

是的，投资AI的前提是它将带来更高的生产力、更广泛的应用，以及所有这些都将奏效。我的意思是，这就是技术投资的运作方式。所以，如果基础本身没有得到技术投资的支持，这些股票是不会上涨的，领导者也不会上涨。我们假设这将在2026年发生。这是我们论点的一部分。但是，这并非没有风险。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think it's one and the same. I mean I mean obviously the investment in AI is on the premise that it will lead to higher productivity, adoption and all that works. works. I mean that's the way technology investment works. So you you're not yeah these stocks are not going to work. The leaders aren't going to work if the foundation itself isn't being supported by the technology investment. We assume that is going to happen in 2026. That is part of our thesis. Okay. But it's not without risk.</p>

任何资本支出周期都会自然演变。你总会面临回报的挑战。我们已经多次看到这种情况。一年前我们就看到了。我们已经多次讨论过这个问题。2024年7月，那是AI资本支出减速的顶峰。所以这是一个潮起潮落的过程。我喜欢看的是AI支出者。这些股票的反应如何？市场是否对AI支出者施加了纪律，然后这种纪律又传导到资本支出的受益者身上。但我们认为这将会发生。资金现在已经筹集到了。所以，你知道，像债务市场现在也参与进来了，所以这些钱不会闲置在这些资产负债表上。它会被花掉。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Well, I mean this is a natural evolution of any capital spending cycle. There's always going to be a challenge on the return you're going to get. And this is, you know, we've seen this multiple times. We saw it a year ago. We've talked about this, you know, multiple times. In July of 2024, that was the peak in sort of the and AI capbacks deceleration. So, this is an eb and flow. What I what I like to look at is AI spenders. How are those stocks reacting? Is the market enforcing discipline on the AI spenders, which then trickles down into the the capex beneficiaries. But we think this is going to happen. The money's been raised now. So, you know, like the debt marketers are now involved and so that money is not going to sit on these balance sheets. It's going to be spent.</p>
</details>

问题是回报会是什么样子，以及回报的时间点。我们认为我们会在2026年、2027年看到一些回报，所以现在只是一个过渡期。你在来回交易。所以我想明确一点，我们认为市场会扩大。这并不意味着所有AI相关的股票都会被扼杀，而其他所有股票都会表现得非常好。它们可以和谐共存。事实上，在某种程度上，它们需要和谐共存。

<p class="english-text">The question is what's the payoff look like and what's the timing of that payoff. We think some we'll see some of that in 2026 2027 and and so now it's just this transition. You're you're kind of trading back and forth. So I want to make it clear we think there's a broadening out. That doesn't mean that all the AI stuff gets killed and everything else does really really well. It it can work in harmony. In fact, it needs to work in harmony to some degree.</p>

好的，今天就到这里。谢谢大家。感谢每一位朋友的到来。我们收盘时再见。再次强调，本周我们没有太多财报。我们只会看看市场这股势头能否持续。然后周四是感恩节。所以，如果我们能顺利度过接下来的三天，收复一些关键价位，那将非常重要。我们也会关注特朗普今天晚些时候是否会发布任何行政命令。他计划发布一些，但有时并不总会发生。所以我们会随时向大家更新，然后我会在收盘时回来。

<p class="english-text">All right, that's it for me. Thank you everybody. Appreciate everyone being careful. We'll be live on the market close. Again, we don't have a ton of earnings this week. Uh we will just try to see if this market momentum can continue. And then we got Thanksgiving on Thursday. So, if we can kind of have a good next three days, reclaim some of these levels, that would be important. We'll see if there is any of these Trump executive orders later throughout the day. He's scheduled to do some, but sometimes it doesn't always happen. So, we'll keep everybody updated on that and then I'll be back on the uh on the market close.</p>
