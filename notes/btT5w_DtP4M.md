title: 全球投资者为何开始对美元敞口进行对冲？
summary: 本期《Odd Lots》播客深入探讨了美元走弱、黄金价格飙升以及人工智能在股市中的韧性等年度重大市场事件。国际清算银行（BIS）经济顾问Hun Shin解释了在市场动荡时期，投资者为何不再将美元视为传统的避险资产，而是通过外汇掉期等工具积极对美元敞口进行对冲。讨论分析了对冲成本、美元在全球金融体系中的网络效应，以及新兴市场资产表现与美元走弱之间的关系。文章还触及了黄金作为投机资产的新角色，并对当前市场中由政府债务而非私人信贷引发的潜在系统性风险进行了探讨。这一转变反映了投资者对美国主权信用和企业活力的不同看法。

### 播客开场：美元、黄金与市场分歧

**Bloomberg:** 音乐。

**Tracy Alloway:** 大家好，欢迎收听《Odd Lots》播客的又一期节目。我是Tracy Alloway。

<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to another episode of the Odd Lots podcast. I'm Tracy Aloway</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我是Joe Weisenthal。Joe，今年有很多重大新闻，但有些确实是非常非常大的事件。我们经历了“解放日”和市场崩盘。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I'm Joe Weisenthal. Joe, there are so many huge stories that you could pull out of this year, but I mean like some actually really really big ones. So we had liberation day and the market crash.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我们看到美元持续走弱，这在今年一直是一种缓慢的、持续的下跌。我们录制这期节目是在10月17日，美元再次下跌。尽管它确实下跌了，但在9月中旬我们曾触及低点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We had the continued weakness in the US dollar which has been this sort of slow burn crash across the year. And we're recording this, let's see, October 17th, and the dollar is down yet again. Although it is down, there's been a little, you know, we hit a low in mid-September.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 别替美元找借口，Joe。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Don't make apologies for the dollar, Joe.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 不，我只是继续说，然后我就……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, I just keep going, and then I'm</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 好的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">all right.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 继续。然后我可能会补充一些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Keep going. Then I might add something.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 美元下跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Fall in the dollar.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的，就是这样。今年到目前为止，美元的下跌非常显著。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, there's that. The fall in the dollar is very big so far this year.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 但黄金价格却大幅上涨，似乎一直在创下新高。然后我们看到人工智能和股市持续的强势、韧性，或者随便你怎么称呼它，人们对人工智能充满热情。目前，人们对“企业美国”和以其货币形式体现的“主权美国”的看法似乎存在分歧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But this huge ramp-up in the price of gold, which seems to hit a new record all the time. And then we've had the continued strength, resilience, whatever you want to call it, enthusiasm about AI and the stock market. And it really seems like there's this division at the moment between how people feel about corporate America and how people feel about sovereign America in the form of its currency.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** Tracy，你知道我最后悔做的事情是什么吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know what I really regret doing, Tracy?</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我真的后悔。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I really regret.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 你是不是有一大堆黄金给处理掉了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Did you have a hoard of gold that you got rid of or something?</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 不，不。我办理了一笔以黄金计价的抵押贷款。你知道，我感觉自己太蠢了。我感觉自己太蠢了。我为什么要那样做？我明明可以用美元支付，却办理了以黄金计价的抵押贷款。我当时在想什么？不，我没有那样做。但如果我做了，那将是一笔非常糟糕的交易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No. No. I took out a gold-denominated mortgage. I feel so stupid. I feel so stupid. Why did I do that? I get paid in dollars, and I took out a gold-denominated mortgage. What was I thinking? No, I didn't. But had I done it, that would have been a very bad trade.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 记得那些故事吗？有点跑题了。记得2000年代匈牙利人办理瑞郎计价抵押贷款的故事吗？然后……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Remember those stories from, you know, a little bit of a tangent? Remember all those stories from the Hungarians? They took out those Swiss-denominated mortgages back in the 2000s. And then</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 那在欧洲曾一度非常流行。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that was very much a Europe thing for a while. Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的。那是一个非常有趣的小插曲，我们不必谈论它。但有一点，我之所以对美元下跌有所保留，是因为我确实认为它从年初至今已经下跌了不少。尽管如此，在过去几周，一些非常流行的共识观点正在发生一点转变，这一点令人惊讶。在我们录制节目的10月17日，**10年期国债**（10-Year Treasury: 美国财政部发行的期限为十年的政府债券）收益率已跌破4%。今年你听过多少次关于**陡峭化交易**（Steepener Trade: 押注长期利率与短期利率之差扩大的交易）的讨论？你听过多少次关于**财政主导**（Fiscal Dominance: 财政政策对货币政策产生主导影响的局面）在长期端失控的讨论？美元也稳定了一点。所以，现在对市场来说，在很多方面都是一个非常有趣的时刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. That was a really funny little We don't have to talk about that. But one thing I was just... The only reason I caveated the dollar fall, which I do think it is quite a bit down from the beginning of the year, all that being said, it is striking in the last several weeks the degree to which a few of the very popular consensus ideas for this year are turning a little bit. And I say that, the 10ear Treasury as the time we're recording this October 17th has fallen below 4%. How many times did you hear about the steepener trade this year? How many times did you hear about fiscal dominance losing control at the long end? The dollar it stabilized a little bit. So it is a very interesting moment for markets in many respects right now.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 确实有很多值得讨论的。恭喜你成功管理了你的个人外汇负债。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's definitely a lot to talk about. Congrats on managing your personal FX liabilities.</p>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我做得很好。是的。

**Tracy Alloway:** 用美元赚钱，用美元还抵押贷款。干得好，Joe。

<p class="english-text">getting paid in dollars and paying your mortgage in dollars. Well done, Joe.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 好的。嗯，你知道，这是许多大型投资者目前正在思考的问题。我们也应该好好思考一下。我们真正喜欢与之交谈的人是谁？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Well, you know, this is the kind of thing that a lot of big investors are thinking about at the moment. And we should definitely think about it too. And who is the one person that we really like to talk to?</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 只能有一个人。

<details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 我们在街上遇到过穿着各种服装的人。不过这次你穿的是西装。所以，就是这样。上次我们偶然遇到你时，你穿着登山装备。我们也一样。总之，我们现在在华盛顿特区。我们一如既往地邀请到了完美的嘉宾。我们再次与**Hun Shin**（申铉松: 国际清算银行货币与经济部门主管兼经济顾问）交谈。他是**国际清算银行**（BIS: Bank for International Settlements，一个促进各国中央银行合作的国际金融机构）的经济顾问兼货币与经济部门主管。我们喜欢与他交谈，很高兴他能来这里谈论许多市场参与者和政策制定者目前非常关心的话题。所以，Hun，非常感谢你再次来到《Odd Lots》。

The last time we ran into you randomly, you were wearing hiking gear. And so were we. Anyway, we are here in DC. We have the perfect guest as always. We are speaking once again with Hunin. He is the economic adviser and head of the monetary and economic department at the Bank for International Settlements, the BIS. We love talking to him, and it's so great to have him here to talk about something that's really been on the minds of a lot of market participants, a lot of policy makers right now. So Hun, thank you so much for coming back on OddLots.</p>

### 美元避险地位的动摇与对冲需求

**Hun Shin:** 谢谢Tracy，谢谢Joe。很高兴再次回来。既然Joe怀疑我这期节目的整个前提……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you Tracy. Thank you Joe. It's great to be back. Since Joe doubts my entire premise for this episode,</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我一点也不怀疑整个前提。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't doubt the entire premise at all.</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** 不，我们先从你认为今年有多不寻常开始吧？我感觉发生了太多事情。我们得把思绪拉回到四月份，那时我们经历了**解放日**（Liberation Day: 此处指特定市场事件，导致美元下跌和市场抛售），并看到美元在市场抛售时下跌，这本不该发生。在动荡和压力时期，投资者本应寻求**美元**（Greenback: 美元的俗称）的避险港湾。而现在，快进到十月份，我想我们已经有点习惯了这种特殊的动态。但你当时有多惊讶？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, let's just start with how unusual would you say this year has been? And I feel like so much has happened. We kind of have to cast our minds back to April when we did have liberation day and when we did see the dollar fall as the market was selling off, which was something that's not really supposed to happen. You're supposed to have investors reach for the safe haven of the greenback in times of turmoil and stress. And now, fast forward to October, I think we've gotten a little bit more used to that particular dynamic. But how surprised were you at that time?</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** 嗯，四月份发生了一系列非常不寻常的事件组合。我们看到的是所谓的“三重下跌”，即股票、债券和美元同步下跌。这非常不寻常，因为在避险时期（四月份就是），美元通常会走强，会出现一种避险资金流。当时当然有很多新闻，你看到很多关于美元可能失去其国际地位等等的报道。我认为事后看来，那有些仓促。现在我们有了数据，可以更连贯地拼凑出当时的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it was a very unusual combination of events in April. So, what we saw was the so-called triple decline where you had stocks, bonds, and the dollar falling in unison. And that's very unusual because in a risk-off episode, you know, which April was, typically the dollar would rally, you know, there would be a kind of safe haven flow. And, you know, back then, there was of course a lot of news, and you saw a lot of stories back then about, you know, possibly the dollar losing its international status and so on. I think in retrospect that was, you know, quite hasty, and I think now that we have the data, we can piece together in a more kind of coherent way what was going on. And</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** 简而言之，我认为这是一个对冲的故事，投资者持有大量美元敞口，试图减少其中一部分。我们可以深入探讨这种交易可能如何进行。碰巧今年也是国际清算银行进行三年一次外汇市场调查的年份，我们刚刚公布了结果，我认为我们也可以借此对四月份的事件提供更多解释。我们先保持宏观视角，然后再深入到具体的月份和周。人们为国际清算银行工作，他们可能必须在巴塞尔用瑞郎办理抵押贷款。总之，跑题了。今年调查的一些主要发现是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">in short, I think it was a kind of hedging story, where investors who had lots of exposures to the US dollar were trying to reduce some of those exposures, and we can get into some of the details on how, you know, that kind trade might transpire. And it just so happens that this is also the year that the BIS conducts its triannual survey of FX markets, and we've just published the results, and I think we can also shed some more light on the events in April. Let's keep it big picture still and then we'll drive down into specific months and weeks. What is people work for the BIS? They probably must take out mortgages and Swiss Frank, but living there in Basel. Anyway, sidetrack. What are some of the big takeaways from this year's survey?</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** 是的，是的。所以，我想，嗯，实际上在我们谈到那里之前。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. So, I think well actually before we go there.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 当然。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure.</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** Joe，嗯，我的意思是，值得思考的是外汇市场如何在投资策略中发挥作用。所以，如果你是一个长期投资者，比如说你是一个欧元区的养老基金。你所拥有的，是对你当地的、以欧元计价的受益人的义务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Joe, um, I mean it's worth, you know, thinking about how FX markets really figure in the investment strategy. So, you know, if you're a long-term investor, let's say that you're a Euro area pension fund. What you have are obligations to your, you know, local</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 以欧元计价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">in euros.</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** 是的，你知道，以欧元计价的受益人，但你拥有非常庞大的资产负债表，因此你需要对全球资产有非常广泛的敞口，包括那些非欧元计价的资产。所以通常会发生的是，一些欧元会被兑换成美元，用于投资美元资产。但当然，你想要做的是确保你对冲了这种货币风险。这就是**外汇掉期**（FX Swap: 一种同时进行即期外汇交易和远期外汇交易的金融工具，用于对冲货币风险）这种工具真正发挥作用的地方。这是一种操作，本质上，欧元区投资者抵押一些欧元，然后借入美元，再用这些美元投资于美元计价的资产。当你这样做的时候，你还承诺在未来某个已知汇率和固定时间点解除这笔交易。所以，一旦你完成了这笔交易，你的货币风险就被对冲了。现在，你以这种方式对冲多少外国投资组合，这会随时间变化。我的意思是，这取决于，例如，对冲成本有多高，因为你通常是短期操作，并且会滚动对冲。重要的是短期美元利率，因为你借入美元是为了投资美元资产。所以当短期利率非常高时，通常对冲成本也会非常高。因此，过去几年发生的情况是，这些所谓的**对冲比率**（Hedge Ratios: 投资组合中被对冲的资产比例）一直在下降，甚至有些投资者根本不对冲。如果美元飙升，对冲成本又如此之高，你为什么要对冲呢？所以，当今年早些时候出现动荡时，许多投资者基本上都因为没有对冲而面临巨大的美元敞口。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. You know, beneficiaries in euros, but you have a very large balance sheet, and so you need to have a very broad exposure to global assets, you know, including those in non-euro denominated assets. So what tends to happen is some of the euros are then converted into dollars to to invest in in dollar assets. But of course what you want to do is to make sure that you hedge that currency risk. And this is where this instrument called an FX swap really comes into its own. And it's an operation where essentially the Euro area investor pledges some euros and then borrows dollars and then with those dollars then go into dollar denominated assets and as you do that you also promise to unwind that transaction at a known exchange rate at a fixed, you know, moment in the future. So essentially once you've gone through that transaction, your currency risk is hedged. Now exactly how much of your foreign portfolio you hedge in this way that varies over time. I mean it depends for example on, you know, how high the the hedging costs are because you're typically doing this fairly short term and you're rolling over these hedges. What's important is the short-term dollar interest rate because you know, you're borrowing dollars in order to invest in dollar assets. So when the short-term interest rate is very high, that's typically a time when hedging costs are very high. And so what had happened over the last few years was that these so-called hedge ratios, you know, the proportion of your assets that you actually hedge had been really, you know, trending down, and, you know, to the extent that some investors, you know, didn't hedge at all, and why would you if the dollar is surging and the hedging cost is so large. And so when the turbulence broke earlier in the year, a lot of investors were basically caught with very large dollar exposures, you know, having not hedged.</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** 我认为，四月份的事件很大程度上是一个事后对冲的故事，即在事件发生后进行对冲，一个证据就是我们看到市场上出现了许多掉期交易和美元抛售的明显迹象。所以，如果一个投资者持有美元资产但没有对冲，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think one piece of evidence that, you know, this was, that the events of April was very much an expos hedging story, you know, hedging after the fact, was that, you know, we saw a lot of the telltale signs of swaps being taken out and dollars being sold happening in the market. So what would happen is, you know, if an investor is holding dollar assets, you know, without a hedge</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 嗯哼。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mhm.</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** 但你担心美元下跌，那么你就会进行事后对冲。你可以通过进行外汇掉期交易来实现，但随后会卖出你获得的美元。所以，你不是将这些美元投资于美元资产，而是在即期市场直接卖出。这种动态意味着，在机构投资者试图提高对冲比率但又是在事后进行对冲的情况下，市场会面临巨大的下行压力。那么回到三年期调查，我们从中看到了什么能进一步阐明这一事件？顺便说一句，这次三年期调查的抽样期恰好是今年四月。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but you're concerned about the dollar falling, then what you would do is you would put on a hedge expost. You would put on a hedge after the event, and you could do that for example by actually then engaging in an FX swap right there, but then selling the dollars that you've acquired. So rather than investing those dollars into dollar assets, you simply sell it in the spot market. What that kind of dynamics would would imply is that there would be, you know, lots of downward pressure in those situations where institutional investors are trying to, you know, raise their hedge ratios, but exposed. So back to the trienal, what do we see there that, you know, puts additional light on this episode? Oh, by the way, on on the trienal, you know, this, it just so happened that the sampling period was April this year.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 太棒了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amazing.</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** 所以，你知道，它可能被四月份的事件稍微扭曲了。另一方面，好消息是我们有一些关于四月份事件的绝佳数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you know, it may be slightly distorted by the events of, you know, the April episode. On the other hand, the silver lining is that we have some great data,</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 我敢打赌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I bet,</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** 关于四月份事件的。但总体数据确实非常引人注目。日均交易量达到9.66万亿美元。这比2022年上次调查高出近30%。美元仍然是主导货币。所有交易的90%都涉及美元。这甚至比我们在2022年看到的还要高。所以，你知道，尽管这次调查可能受到了四月份这些压力事件的影响，但我们认为我们得到了一个非常好的结果。今年我们注意到的一件事是，除了外汇掉期（这是交易中迄今为止最大的部分）之外，我们还看到即期交易和远期交易大幅增加。所以，让我为听众解释一下。当你进行外汇掉期时，投资者会抵押欧元借入美元，然后还有一个承诺要反向操作。这个承诺就叫做远期。当然，你可以在不通过掉期的情况下获得它。我们可以直接找交易商说，你看，给我卖一个所谓的**即期远期合约**（Outright Forward: 一种在未来某个日期以约定汇率买卖货币的合约，不涉及即期交易），然后我就会有美元债务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">on really the, you know, the events of the, of the April episode. But the headline numbers are really quite, um, you know, quite notable. It's $9.66 trillion daily flow. This is like something like almost 30% higher than the previous survey in 22. The dollar is still very much the dominant currency. It's 90% of all of the transactions have the dollar on one side. It's even higher than what we saw in 22. So, you know, in spite of the the the survey being affected perhaps by these, you know, stress events in April, you know, we think we've got a very very good sort of take. One of the things that we noticed this year is of course, you know, as well as the FX swaps which is by far the largest segment of the of the transactions. We also see a lot of a big increase in the spot transactions and also outright forwards. So let me just explain that for your listeners. You know, when you engage in a in an FX swap, you know, we the investor would borrow dollars by pledging euros and then there's also a promise to reverse that. Now that promise is called a forward and of course you can get that, you know, without going through the swap. We can just go to a dealer and say look, you know, just sell me a outright forward so-called and then I would actually then have a dollar obligation</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 掉期，或者说掉期就像即期交易加上远期交易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">a swap or a swap is like a spot trade plus a forward</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** 完全正确，就是这种组合。我们看到，除了掉期交易，今年即期和远期这两个组成部分都非常非常大。我们认为四月份的事件一定产生了影响，因为除了进行掉期交易并在即期市场卖出美元外，你也可以直接向交易商寻求远期合约，但这样一来，交易商就必须对冲。所以无论如何都会有即期销售。因此，这种组合实际上会导致即期和远期交易都大幅增加，而这正是我们所看到的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">exactly it's that combination and what we see is as well as the swaps we see the two components the spot and the forward being very very large this year and we think that the events of April must have had a, you know, had an impact because, you know, as well as getting the swap and selling the dollars in the spot market, you can also just ask a dealer for a forward contract, but then of course the dealer has to hedge. So there, you know, there's going to be a spot sale anyway. And so that combination would actually lead you to a situation where both a spot and a forward transactions go up a lot and that's exactly what we see.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 有趣。所以这是另一个证据，表明这在很大程度上是事后对冲。让我再提两点。今年夏天早些时候我们发布了一份公报。我们列出了所有其他我们能收集到的证据。但同样值得注意的是，如果你看实际的投资组合资金流数据，国际投资组合资金流数据，四月份并没有真正的抛售。所以，你知道，流出量非常非常小，但从整体来看，它真的很微不足道。当然也没有协调一致的资金从美国流出。所以，我认为这也许是最有说服力的证据，表明所谓的“抛售美国”交易并不是四月份事件背后的故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Interesting. So this is another piece of the evidence that this was very much exposed hedging. And let me mention just two other things on this. We put out a bulletin earlier in the summer. We, you know, lay out all the other pieces of evidence that we could, you know, gather. But it's also notable that if you look at the actual portfolio flow numbers, the international portfolio flow flow numbers, there was no real selling in April. So you know, there was a very very small outflow, but on the scale of things, it was really tiny. there were certainly no, um, you know, concerted portfolio outflows, you know, from the US. So that's really the I think perhaps the most, um, you know, compelling evidence that the so-called sell America trade was not, uh, you know, was not the story behind the April episode.</p>

### 全球金融体系的网络效应与美元的特殊地位

**Joe Weisenthal:** 音乐。从定性或定量角度来看，如果这是一个“对冲美国”的故事，而不是直接的“抛售美国”的故事，我们为什么要关心呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why should we care either qualitatively or quantitatively if this was a hedge America story and not a sell America story outright</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** 从长远来看，长期投资者可能会重新评估他们的全球敞口，你也会听到很多传闻证据表明这些讨论正在进行，但到目前为止，这还没有真正转化为行动。但我认为，从春季的行动中非常清楚地看出，当我们审视全球金融体系的各个组成部分时，每个部分都依赖于其他部分。

It is possible that, you know, long-term investors would then reassess their their global exposures and you see and you hear a lot of anecdotal evidence that, you know, these conversations are going on, but so far that hasn't really been, you know, translated into actions, but I think what, you know, does flow very, you know, clearly from, you know, from the actions in the spring is that when we look at the various pieces of the global financial system, every part, you know, depends on other parts.</p>

**Hun Shin:** 存在这种网络效应，只要其他人都在围绕美元做他们正在做的事情，那么参与这个生态系统也符合我的利益。所以，如果你有这种新网络效应，就很难进行大规模的转变。我认为不寻常的一点，我可能在其他几期节目中也说过，但这个环境让我觉得引人注目的是，如果你看美国，我可以说出一长串令人担忧的理由，我们不需要在这里重复。另一方面，世界上最赚钱、最令人印象深刻、最尖端的公司都在美国，每个人都希望以某种方式接触这些公司。这让我觉得这是一种不寻常的情况，我们通常不会将不稳定的主权国家与世界上最具活力的公司所在地联系起来。所以在我看来，我很乐意更多地接触**英伟达**（Nvidia: 一家全球领先的图形处理器和人工智能芯片制造商）和**微软**（Microsoft: 一家全球领先的软件、服务和解决方案公司），以及所有这些赚钱如流水的公司，而无需接触美国本身，因此我可能想要对冲。我的意思是，当然，股票市场的故事，它确实独树一帜，正如你所说，这确实是一个非常非常强劲的主题，但更广泛地说，资本市场，如果你考虑资本市场如何运作，它背后有一个完整的生态系统，你显然有基础证券，但你也有对冲工具，然后你有一整套投资者实际参与其中，而银行系统在提供这些对冲服务方面绝对至关重要。我想我们上次在杰克逊霍尔讨论这个问题时，我们谈到了外汇掉期市场如何使资金在不同货币之间具有**可互换性**（Fungible: 指一种商品或资产可以与同类商品或资产互换，而价值不会改变）。

<p class="english-text">And there is this network effect where provided that everyone else is doing what they're doing around the US dollar then it's also in my interest to actually, you know, be part of that, you know, ecosystem. So if you have this kind of neo network effect it's very difficult to, you know, have this wholesale shift away. One of the things that I think is unusual and I I probably said this in a few other episodes, but what I think is striking about this environment is that if you look at the US, I can come up with a long list of reasons to be concerned, which we don't need to come down recapitulate. Now, on the other hand, the most profitable, impressive, cutting edge companies in the world that everyone would love to have exposure to in some way are in the US. And it strikes me as that's the unusual situation which is we don't typically associate volatile sovereigns with being the home of the most dynamic companies in the world. And so to my mind I would love to have expo more exposure to Nvidia and Microsoft and all of these companies that are making money handover fist without having exposure to the US itself and hence I might want to hedge. I mean certainly, you know, the equity market story I mean that really is in a class of its own and as you say that's really been a very very strong theme but more broadly, you know, capital markets if you think about how capital markets operate, there's a whole ecosystem behind that and you have the underlying securities obviously, but then you have the hedging instruments and then you have a whole set of investors who are actually, you know, taking part and the banking system is absolutely crucial in providing those hedging services. And I think when we last discussed this back in Jackson Hole, you know, we talked about how the FX swap market makes, you know, money fungeible across currencies.</p>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 嗯哼。

<p class="english-text">Mh.</p>

**Hun Shin:** 而且，你知道，货币最终与银行有关。所以，中央银行发行高能货币。商业银行也发行其他用户将利用的货币。外汇掉期基本上提供了这种使资金在不同货币之间具有可互换性的服务。所以，你知道，从这个意义上说，每个部分都与所有其他部分契合，所以，你知道，我们应该从这个网络的相互强化部分来思考这个问题。

<p class="english-text">And you know, money is ultimately something to do with banks. So, you know, the central bank, you know, issues highowered money. Commercial banks are there also to issue money that the other users will will take advantage of. and FX swaps are there, you know, basically providing this service of making money fungeible across currencies. So, you know, every piece fits into every other piece in that sense, and so, you know, we should think about this in terms of the the mutually reinforcing pieces of this, you know, this network.</p>

### 外汇对冲成本与新兴市场债券的启示

**Tracy Alloway:** 你对外汇对冲成本的实际趋势有什么观察？因为正如你所描述的，在四月份，一切突然开始。许多大型投资者，他们可能不习惯对冲他们的美元敞口，突然争相事后对冲。这是否意味着实际对冲的成本增加了，还是仍然相对便宜？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What have you observed in in terms of the actual trends in FX hedging costs? Because as you described it in April, suddenly it all starts kicking off. A lot of large investors who are not that used perhaps to having to hedge their dollar exposure suddenly scrambled to do it expost as you described. Did that mean that the cost of actually doing so actually increased or was it still relatively cheap?</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** 嗯，实际上，这主要取决于短期利率有多高，特别是如果你是非美国投资者投资美元资产，那主要取决于短期美元利率有多高。因为本质上，我们做的是，你抵押欧元，然后短期借入美元，再投资于美元资产。所以，这实际上是关于短期利率相对于你从资产本身获得的收益有多高。所以，如果收益率曲线平坦，就像我们过去那样，甚至收益率曲线倒挂，那么对冲成本就会非常高。因此，事实上，投资者通常会进行对冲，对冲比率也有所波动。虽然没有系统的调查，但它在40%到60%之间波动。我的意思是，有一些官方数据，比如日本的寿险公司，但通常这确实是相当零散的。但过去一年左右发生的情况是，对冲比率逐渐下降。有些公司甚至根本不对冲。他们试图在美元走强和高收益率两方面都获利。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, actually it's, um, it's primarily about how high the short-term interest rates are actually, and in particular if you're a non-US investor investing in dollar assets, it's really how high the short-term dollar interest rate is. Because essentially what we're doing is, you know, you're pledging euros, let's say, and then borrowing dollars short-term and then investing in dollar assets. And so it's really about, um, how high that short-term interest rate is relative to the yield you're getting on the, uh, on the asset itself. And so if you have a flat yield curve, you know, which is what we've had or even inverted yield curve, then hedging costs are very high. And so in fact, you know, investors have typically hedged and hedge ratios have fluctuated. There's no systematic survey, but it's fluctuated between 40 and 60%. I mean there are some pockets of official data like the Japanese life insurance companies but typically this is, you know, really quite quite anecdotal but what had happened, um, in the last year or so was, uh, the hedge ratios had gone down gradually. Some firms were not even hedging at all. You know, they were trying to win both on the stronger dollar but also on the high yields. Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** 实际上，让我在这里提一个非常有趣的点。实际上，思考一下这个关于发达经济体投资者持有美元资产的故事，与关于本币新兴市场债券的故事之间的相似之处是值得的。你知道，这实际上是一种非常非常重要的资产类别，它在**全球金融危机**（GFC: Global Financial Crisis，指2008年爆发的全球性金融危机）之后才真正发展起来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Actually let me just me, um, mention a very interesting point here actually. Um, it's actually, uh, worth thinking about the parallels between this story about, you know, advanced economy investors holding US dollar assets with the story about local currency emerging market bonds. You know, that's actually a very very, you know, important asset class that really grew up after the GFC</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** 这是一种典型的资产类别，投资者不会对冲。所以，如果你想进行一笔大的新兴市场主权债券交易，你实际上会以无对冲的方式购买该工具。你这样做是因为，你知道，你认为新兴市场货币会升值，同时收益率会下降。所以你赢了两次。你知道，你在收益率和汇率上都获得了收益。但当然，当形势逆转时，你就会争相事后对冲，这正是我们在这次事件中看到的同样类型的事情。而且实际上，新兴市场投资者，特别是来自亚洲的投资者，他们的对冲比率非常低，并且正在进行事后对冲。所以，四月份发生的事情与更早的新兴市场交易之间，实际上存在一个非常有趣的相似之处。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and that's typical asset class where the investor would not hedge. So if you want to enter into a large emerging market sovereign bond trade, you would actually buy the instrument on an unhedged basis. And you do that because, you know, you think, um, the emerging market currency will appreciate as well as the yield fall. And so you win twice. You know, you gain both on the yield, you know, as well as on the exchange rate. But of course when the tide turns that's when you you know scramble to, you know, hedge expost and that's exactly, you know, the same type of thing that we saw, you know, in this, uh, in this episode and you and there were actually, uh, emerging market investors especially from Asia who were, you know, caught with very low hedge ratios and there was this expost hedging going on. So there's actually a very interesting parallel between, uh, you know, what was, you know, going on this April and the much older trade which is the emerging market trade.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 所以Joe，从积极方面看，人们不一定会抛售美元资产。从消极方面看，我们基本上是在像对待本地新兴市场债券一样对待美元资产。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Joe on the plus side people aren't necessarily selling dollar assets. On the downside, the negative side, we're basically treating dollar assets the way we would a local emerging market bond.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 人们会说，“我想我会买一些本币计价的美国国债。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">People are like, I think I'm gonna buy some local currency US debt.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 没错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's right.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 嗯，实际上，那么四月份到底发生了什么导致了这种变化？我的意思是，我们知道当时确实爆发了贸易战，有大规模关税等等，但到底是什么原因导致人们对对冲美元敞口的冲动增加了，正如你所描述的，是什么让他们说“哦，我们想改变我们对美元的敞口，即使我们不想卖掉它们”？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um actually but like so what was it about April then that caused the like what I mean we know there was yeah they launched a trade war and there were like massive tariffs etc but like what was it about that such that people's uh impulses to hedge more expose factor as you've described it what was the thing that said oh we want to uh change our uh the our sort of our exposure to dollars even if we don't want to sell them</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** 我想这可能是多种因素的结合，但投资者在对冲比率方面的处境与此有很大关系。实际上，如果你查阅你的**彭博**（Bloomberg: 一家全球性的金融数据、媒体和分析公司）新闻数据库，你会发现2023年到2024年有很多报道，例如寿险公司宣布他们将不对冲，也就是说他们将持有美元资产但没有对冲。正如我所说，有些公司根本不对冲。在避险环境中，通常会发生的情况是你想要减少一些风险。这意味着减少你的敞口。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's probably a combination of several things, but where the, you know, where the investors found themselves in terms of the hedge ratios had a lot to do with this. Um actually if you look through your, you know, Bloomberg news database, you'll find plenty of stories from 23 24 where, uh, let's say life insurance companies announce that they will not be hedging, you know, there so you know, they would be holding, uh, let's say US dollar assets, but without a hedge, and as I said, you know, there were some firms that didn't hedge at all, and in a risk-off environment, what typically happens that you want to take some chips off the table. And that just means reducing your exposure.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** 如果你以这种双重打击的方式暴露在外，你实际上会尝试事后对冲或减少你的敞口。从证据来看，这在很大程度上是事后对冲的故事。所以，如果人们对美元敞口进行对冲，比他们中至少一部分人过去习惯的程度更高，我们是否需要担心像展期风险或某种期限错配的问题，即你有一个短期对冲，无论是远期还是掉期，与一个长期资产不匹配。我的意思是，这是国际清算银行日常工作的一部分，就是担心潜在风险。那么，你现在担心吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if you're exposed, you know, in this double whammy fashion, you know, you would actually try and, um, you know, either hedge expost or reduce your exposure. It looks like, uh, from the evidence that it was very much the expost hedging story. So if people are hedging their dollar exposure more than perhaps some of them at least used to, do we have to worry about things like rollover risk or some sort of I guess duration mismatched where you have a shortterm, um, hedge whether it's a forward or a swap or whatever mismatched to a longer term asset. I mean this is this is what the BIS does on a day-to-day basis is worry about potential risks. So, are you worried here?</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** Tracy，这是一个非常棒的评论。嗯，我想这正是我接下来要谈的。当然，一旦你对冲了，你至少在掉期到期之前对冲了货币风险，这通常是1到3个月。但这是一个短期负债，你需要展期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's a really great comment, Tracy. And, uh, um, I think this was, uh, you know, where I was going to go next. Um, of course, you have this, you know, once you hedge, you've hedged the currency risk at least until the maturity of the swap, which is typically, you know, 1 month to 3 months. But, uh, it's a short-term, it's a short-term liability that you need to roll over.</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** 有时你可能会陷入流动性压力事件，难以获得美元来偿还，例如**全球金融危机**（GFC: Global Financial Crisis，指2008年爆发的全球性金融危机）期间就发生了这种情况。2020年3月也发生了类似情况，当时也出现了美元抢购潮。当你是一个长期投资者，使用短期外汇掉期进行对冲，但持有长期证券时，就会出现期限错配。所以，你要么必须以公平价格出售你的长期资产（这会非常困难），要么就必须与市场上所有其他美元借款人一起抢购美元。这就是一个悖论，你是一个长期投资者，但实际上你却有这种短期美元债务。所以，我们实际上是用一种风险换取另一种风险。我们实际上是将货币错配换成了期限错配。从经验上看，如果你回顾多年的证据，当美元长期下跌时，这些对冲比率会变得非常非常高。所以，一个很好的例子就是全球金融危机之前的时期，当时美元确实相当大幅度地贬值。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And from time to time you might get caught in a in a liquidity, uh, you know, stress episode where it's difficult to source the dollars to actually repay and this was for example what happened during the GFC. It's also what happened during March 2020, uh, when there was also a scramble for dollars and, uh, you know, when you're a long-term investor, you've hedged using, uh, a short-term FX swap, but you're holding, you know, long-term securities, you have a maturity mismatch, so either you have to somehow, you know, sell your long-term assets, which is going to be very difficult at a fair price, or you have to join the scramble for dollars, uh, with all all the other borrowers of dollars in the market. And so this is the paradox where, you know, you're a long-term investor, but actually you have this short-term, uh, you know, dollar obligation. And so, you know, we we are swapping one, uh, well, we are actually, you know, exchanging one type of risk for another. We're actually changing currency mismatch for maturity mismatch. And, um, uh, you know, empirically if you look at the evidence over the years, it's when the dollar is falling for a long period of time that these hedge ratios become very very high. So, you know, good example is the period before the GFC when, uh, you know, dollar was, uh, you know, really falling, uh, you know, quite considerably. Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 但后来在全球金融危机期间发生的情况是，美元确实飙升了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But then what happened at the GFC was of course, you know, dollar really spiked</p>

**Hun Shin:** 因为当时出现了美元抢购潮。所以总是有这种权衡。你要么承担一些货币风险，要么承担这种期限风险，然后，你知道，承担这种期限错配风险，我应该说，所以我们，你知道，这实际上是，你知道，用一种风险换取……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because there was a scramble for dollars.

### 新兴市场基本面与美元走弱

**Joe Weisenthal:** 但是，你提到了新兴市场债券基金、新兴市场指数，以及货币表现非常好。这引出了一个问题：这是否是分子故事？是关于美元走弱，还是关于……我们一直在谈论金融流动。那么，许多新兴市场的潜在经济基本面是否发生了变化？我听到了一些关于这方面的传闻。人们对新兴市场的兴奋程度，我认为在2010年代完全没有达到这种程度。就在我们聊天的时候，我查阅了一堆与新兴市场相关的基金和货币，它们都表现得非常好。在你的研究中，新兴世界是否发生了根本性的变化，让人们感到兴奋的原因不仅仅是美元走弱？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But but em and you mentioned um em and uh em bond funds, em indices and currency is doing very well. And so this gets to the question of like is this a numerator story? Is it about dollar weakening or is it about uh so we've been talking a lot about financial flows. Has something changed though in the sort of underlying economic fundamentals of a lot of EM? I've heard some rumblings about this. People excited about EM in a way that I don't think they were excited about to the same degree during the 2010s at all. And I just while we were chatting, I pulled up a bunch of lines of EM related funds, currencies all doing very well. In your research, are there fundamental changes in the EM world that are like people are excited about for reasons other than the fact that the uh dollar is weak?</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** Joe，这非常及时。碰巧在周一，我们发布了一份关于这个问题的公报。新兴市场表现良好，是因为更好的政策、更好的基本面，还是真的与全球金融市场趋势有关？简短的答案是两者兼而有之。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, this is very timely, Joe. And as it happens on Monday, we published a bulletin exactly on this question. Um you are the emerging markets doing well because of better policy, better fundamentals or is it really about the the global financial market trends? And the short answer is it's a bit of both.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** Tracy喜欢这个。

**Hun Shin:** 你会，你知道，不会有其他想法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and you would, and you would, you know, not think of otherwise.</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** 为什么基本面更好呢？我认为，当然，政策方面有了很大的改善，特别是货币政策。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um why is it better fundamentals? Well, I think it's, uh, uh, certainly, uh, there's been much better policy, uh, especially, uh, monetary policy</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** 而且新兴市场实际上也受到了美元走弱的提振。美元走弱在今年大部分时间里都是一个有利因素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and also the emerging markets have, uh, have really been boyed by actually, you know, uh, the weaker dollar. The weaker dollar has been a tailwind, um, for much of the year.</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** 这就是为什么新兴市场资产确实大幅上涨，而且与信用利差也有相似之处，因为当信用表现良好时，我们也倾向于看到新兴市场资产表现良好。如果我们分解一下，为什么美元走弱会对新兴市场有利呢？嗯，你知道，在最简单的情况下，如果借款人借入美元，但投资于本币资产，就会出现货币错配，但当美元走弱时，就会有意外之财。这是一个非常简单的故事。它可能不是最重要的。但这里还有一个非常有趣的因素，与所谓的**风险承担渠道**（Risk-Taking Channel: 货币政策或金融条件变化影响金融机构风险承担行为的机制）有关。这里的想法是，如果你有一个非常多元化的投资组合，由这些对货币错配借款人的贷款组成，那么这些借款人信用风险的改善，实际上会缩小贷款人信用风险的尾部风险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is why emerging market assets have really, you know, rallied quite hard, and there's there's a parallel with credit spreads as well because, you know, when credit is doing well, we also tend to see emerging market assets also doing well. Um and if we break it down, so why would, uh, uh, a weakening dollar be a tailwind for emerging markets? Well, you know, in the simplest possible case, if a borrower has borrowed dollars but then, uh, has invested in local currency assets, you know, there's this currency mismatch, but then there's a windfall when the when the dollar weakens. That's a very simple story. It's probably not the most important. But there's another very interesting element here which has to do with the so-called risk-taking channel. And the idea here is if you have a very diversified, you know, portfolio of these, um, of the loans to all of these, you know, currency mismatch borrowers, the improved credit risk on these borrowers really, you know, shrinks the tail risk in the credit for the, you know, for the lender.</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** 所以，如果你愿意，**风险价值**（Value at Risk, VaR: 在给定置信水平和时间周期内，资产或投资组合可能遭受的最大损失）会下降，这确实为更多的信贷打开了大门。所以，美元走弱与美元计价信贷的更快增长之间存在非常非常强的关系，而且由于美元信贷对供应链的重要性，如果任何产品、任何商品依赖于非常复杂的供应链、全球价值链，那么这些产品往往会表现非常好。你所看到的是，实际上，尽管美元走弱，这些高度复杂商品的出口却增加了，而且比那些受简单贸易效应和汇率影响更大的商品增加得多。例如，半导体，我的意思是，这是一个惊喜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh so, if you like, the value at risk goes down, and that really opens the door to to more credit. So there's this very very strong relationship between a weaker dollar and faster growth of dollar denominated credit, and because of how important dollar credit is for supply chains, if there's any product, if there's any good that out there that relies on very complex supply chains, global value chains, those products will tend to do very well, and what you've seen is actually in spite of the weaker dollar exports have gone up in these very highly sophisticated goods and much more so than the goods that are much more affected by just a simple the simple trade effect and the exchange rate. So semiconductors for example, I mean this has been one of the surprises.</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** 显然有**人工智能**（AI: Artificial Intelligence，人工智能）热潮，但不仅仅是这样。如果你看亚洲的半导体贸易出口，今年一直非常非常有韧性。任何与全球供应链有关的事情，你也会看到。但这里有一个意想不到的后果，因为正如我们之前谈到的，新兴市场越来越多地成为世界其他地区的净债权人。而且对冲很少。所以，当你陷入这些下行趋势之一时，你会受到美元走弱和高收益率的双重打击。所以我们在四月份看到了很多这种争抢。所以它主要是一个有利因素，而且长期以来一直是一个有利因素，但还有第三个因素，这个新因素，我认为我们需要密切关注。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Clearly there's the AI boom, but it's not just that. If you look at semiconductor trade exports from Asia, that's really been very very resilient this year. And, um, anything that has to do with global supply chains, you would also see. But there's a, you know, there's a sting in the tail here because, as we talked about earlier, emerging markets increasingly are becoming net creditors to the rest of the world. And there was very little hedging going on. And so when you're caught in one of these downdrafts, you get hit both from, you know, the weaker dollar and also the and also the high yields. And so we saw a lot of this, uh, you know, scrambling, uh, you know, back in April. So it's primarily a tailwind and it has been a tailwind for a long time but there is this third element this new element which I think we need to keep an eye on.</p>

### 黄金价格的上涨与系统性风险

**Tracy Alloway:** 当你看到黄金价格时，你看到了什么？我们正在10月17日录制这期节目。今天早上它略有下跌，但仍高于每盎司4000美元。这告诉你投资者目前对各种全球货币的感受如何？

</details>

**Hun Shin:** Tracy，我的意思是，我们听到了很多关于所谓的“贬值交易”的说法。但我认为这可能有些夸大其词。你知道，贬值实际上是关于货币相对于商品和服务的价值。我们并没有真正看到通货膨胀飙升。我们也没有看到商品价格飙升。

And I so I think we should probably look for a more tailored explanation for gold other than simply, you know, this broader, uh, sort of sense of, um, you know, uh, you know, flight from, you know, fiat currencies and, uh, you know, I think one thing which goes back to our initial conversation on, uh, the role of the dollar and the global financial system, certainly central banks have been big buyers of gold and there has been, you know, that sort of, you know, set a very sort of firm, you know, backdrop to, uh, you to the market and other people have jumped on the bandwagon.</p>

**Hun Shin:** 从某种意义上说，它实际上表现得像一种风险资产。当前的事件以及上周的事件……

<p class="english-text">In a way, it's actually behaving like a risk asset. Uh and the events, uh, and the events today and you know last week as well</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** 在压力时期，与其说资金流向黄金避险，不如说我们看到它表现得有点像**比特币**（Bitcoin: 一种去中心化的加密数字货币）和风险资产。所以它告诉你这里多了一些投机成分，但它肯定以一种与历史常态非常不同的方式运行。

<p class="english-text">uh rather than there being a flight, uh, to gold during stress times, what we're seeing is it's behaving a bit like Bitcoin, um, and, uh, and the risk assets. So it sort of tells you that there's been a little bit more of a speculative element, uh, you know, here, but it's certainly behaving in a way that's very different from the from the historical norms.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 你知道，Tracy长期以来一直在谈论这个问题，长期以来你可以通过实际利率来模拟黄金价格，当实际利率非常低或受到抑制时，黄金就会上涨。普京的许多资金被冻结后不久，情况似乎发生了变化。当你说中央银行正在积累黄金时，人们意识到如果钱存在银行里，它就永远不是你自己的钱，这似乎是原因之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know for a long time Traces talked about this for a long time you could sort of model the price of gold via real rates and when they were very low or suppressed or whatever gold went up. It kind of seemed like it changed not long after Putin had a bunch of his money seized. Like is and when you talk about central banks accumulating gold being woken up to the fact that your money is never really your money if it's in a bank that seems like it could be part of it.</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** Joe，我的意思是，当然，很少有资产不是某个人的负债。你知道，通常无论是固定收益工具还是股票，它都是某个人的负债。所以有人有义务支付给你，而黄金是其中之一，它不是任何特定个人的负债。现在，我想，你知道，当我们回顾过去，我们可以看到在70年代早期**布雷顿森林体系**（Bretton Woods: 1944年建立的国际货币体系，将美元与黄金挂钩，其他货币与美元挂钩）崩溃后，黄金价格出现了这种大幅波动，有过短暂的飙升，但随后我们经历了很长一段时间，黄金表现平平。我想，这可能甚至在**俄罗斯入侵乌克兰**（Russian Invasion of Ukraine: 指2022年2月俄罗斯对乌克兰发起的全面军事入侵）之前。所以，你知道，我们看到这种趋势，这种事情实际上在几年前就已经发生过，甚至在2022年俄罗斯入侵乌克兰之前。但我认为，你知道，这个因素，这个属性，即它不是任何特定法律实体或个人的负债，我认为这赋予了它一种特殊的……

<p class="english-text">Well, Joe, I mean, uh, certainly there are very few assets which are not the liabilities of someone of someone. And, uh, you know, typically whether it's a fixed income instrument or an equity, it's someone's liability. So someone has the obligation to pay you and gold is one of those which is not the liability of of of of any particular individual. Now I think, um, you know, when we look back we can see these sort of broad, you know, swings in the price of gold after the breakdown of Bretonwoods in the early '7s, you know, there was a brief spike, but then we had a very very long period when, you know, gold wasn't doing very much. Um I think it, um, it's probably something even before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Joe. Um so, you know, we've seen the trend where something, uh, you know, uh, like this has also sort of happened actually a few years back even, uh, you know, even before the Russian invasion of, uh, Ukraine in 22, but I think it's, um, you know, this this element this, uh, this attribute where it's not the liability of any particular, uh, you know,</p>

**Tracy Alloway:** 所以，我正在看**彭博**（Bloomberg: 一家全球性的金融数据、媒体和分析公司）的顶部菜单，你知道，现在感觉有点紧张。头条新闻是“三家银行涉嫌欺诈引发更广泛担忧”。这就是**Jamie Dimon**（杰米·戴蒙: 摩根大通首席执行官）的“蟑螂理论”，我们开始看到一些损失浮出水面，无论是直接的欺诈还是糟糕的投资，人们开始有点紧张。你目前是否看到了任何与信贷相关的担忧？

<details>

<p class="english-text">So, I'm looking at the the top menu on Bloomberg right now, and you know, it it's feeling a little bit nervy at the moment. So, the number one story is banks trio of alleged fraud sparks fear of broader issues. So, this is the idea that this is Jamie Diamond's cockroach idea that we're starting to see some losses emerge from either outright frauds or just bad investments and people are starting to get a little bit nervous. Do you see any sorts of I guess credit oriented concerns out there at the moment?</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** Tracy，我的意思是，当然，本周是一个新闻非常丰富的环境。我们喜欢它。我们喜欢你为之做出贡献，我认为这很棒。我们听到了很多关于信贷的评论，当然，信贷标准长期以来一直在恶化，我们一直是许多声音之一，甚至在本周之前，就指出信贷利差已跌至历史低点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, Tracy, I mean certainly this week is a very newsrich environment. Um one way you are we love it. We love you are, you know, contributing to that and I think it's great. Um, you know, we we we hear a lot of these comments, uh, you know, on credit certainly credit standards have been eroding for a long time and we have been one of the many voices, uh, you know, even before this week, uh, you know, just pointing out that credit spreads have fallen to historical lows. Um</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** 但如果你看看私人部门信贷的轨迹，并将其与政府债务的变化进行比较，两者之间真的没有可比性。所以，在全球金融危机之前，主要的增长是私人部门信贷，特别是抵押贷款的形式，但之后我们看到私人部门信贷一直非常低迷，取而代之的是政府债券市场大幅增长。现在我们看到的是信贷标准恶化的一些迹象正在反噬。但如果你担心非常系统性的问题，如果你担心系统性风险，首先要问的是它在最近的过去增长了多快。通常，增长非常迅速的东西会给你一些担忧的理由。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but if you look at the the trajectory of uh credit to the private sector and compare that to what's been happening to government debt, uh, there there really isn't, um, a comparison. So it's certainly before the GFC, uh, the big growth was in the credit of the private sector, especially in the form of mortgages, but after that, what we've seen is credit to the private sector has really, uh, been very subdued, um, and instead it's really been the government, uh, uh, you know, bond market which has grown tremendously. Now what we're seeing now is, uh, you know, some signs of the erosion of credit standards, you know, coming back to bite. But if you're worried about something very systemic, if you're, you know, worried about systemic risk, uh, the first thing to ask is how fast has this grown in the recent past. And typically something that's grown very rapidly will, you know, give you some cause for concern.</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** 在这种情况下，真正快速增长的因素不是私人部门信贷，而是政府信贷，特别是政府债券市场。所以我们当然应该担心这些事件，当然，头条新闻会制造……正如我所说，这是一个新闻非常丰富的环境，我们听到了这些，我们在小组讨论中也听到了同样的故事。如果这真的是对下一次系统性危机前兆的担忧，那可能不是事实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In this case, um the really rapidly growing element has not been credit to the private sector. It's been credit to the government and in particular the the government bond market. So we should have, you know, we should of course worry about, uh, um, you know, these, uh, you know, these events and of course the headlines, you know, create, uh, you know, it's as I said, it's a very news-rich environment, uh, we hear that and we hear the same stories in the panels if it's really a concern about, you know, uh, is this the precursor to the next, uh, you know, systemic crisis it's probably not the case</p>
</details>

### 股市风险与财富效应

**Joe Weisenthal:** 实际上，这让我想起了一些我以前从未这样问过的问题。但另一个增长了很多的是股市或股票市场。几天前《**华尔街日报**》（Wall Street Journal: 一家国际知名的商业和金融新闻报纸）上有一篇非常好的文章，讲述了股票敞口（至少在美国）在人口统计学上是如何扩散的。现在有更多工薪阶层家庭拥有股票。当我想到那些担心金融稳定的人时，我认为股票并不是他们关注的重点。它们被称为风险资产。我们都知道它们有风险。通常危机不会从我们都认为有风险的资产中爆发。危机是从我们认为会得到一美元赎回价值的资产中爆发的，我们担心是否能收回一美元，或者根本收不回来。但我很好奇，从专业人士的角度来看，你们和你的同事如何看待股票敞口，特别是考虑到普遍认为股票敞口正在推动美国的消费，这是经济的驱动力，存在大量的投机性退出。那么，是否正在对股票和风险资产进行大量建模工作，特别是将其作为更广泛风险的来源？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">actually this brings to mind something that I don't think I've really asked in such a way before. But another thing that's grown a lot is the stock market or equity equity markets. There was actually a really good article in the Wall Street Journal several days ago about the degree to which equity exposure at least in the US has spread demographically. So a lot many more like working-class households own stocks than they used to. When I think about people who are in the business of being worried about financial stability, they don't I don't think they stocks are high on their radar. They're called risky assets. We all know they're risky. And usually crises don't emerge from assets that we all agree are risky. That crises emerge from assets that we think are going to be redeemed from a dollar's worth. We're going to get a dollars back or whatever or we're worried about getting back at all. But I'm curious from the perspective of someone who professionally maybe worries, how do you and your colleagues think about equity exposure, especially given the widespread view that equity exposure is fueling consumption in the United States, a driver of the economy, that there is a lot of speculative exit. Like is there much modeling work being done on equity and risky assets specifically as a source of broader risk?</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** 绝对。我认为主要的渠道将是通过实体经济。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely. I think I think the, you know, the main channel would be through the real economy.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** 通过实际经济活动，而不是通过去杠杆化事件或流动性事件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Through through real economic activity rather than through let's say a deleveraging episode or a liquidity episode.</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** 我认为回顾2000年的**互联网泡沫**（Dot-com Bubble: 指1990年代末期互联网公司股票价格飙升，随后在2000年代初破裂的经济泡沫）是值得的。你知道，那当然是一个估值更加极端，股市在2000年下跌的时期。当然，我们确实看到了一些影响。当然，许多投资者蒙受了损失。但是，对实体经济的影响与全球金融危机时期的影响完全不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's worth thinking back to the dotcom bubble of 2000. You know that was a period of course when the valuations were even more extreme and when the stock market fell in 2000. Of course, we did see some effect. Um, and of course, a lot of investors lost money. Um, but there was nothing like the same kind of impact on the real economy that we had</p>
</details>

**Hun Shin:** 在全球金融危机中。一个非常简单的说法是，只要你有各种债务，你就应该担心，因为Joe，正如你所说，当你被承诺一美元，但却没有兑现时，你知道，整个经济都会产生连锁反应。现在，显然，股票市场存在财富效应。所以，你知道，如果你有一个非常大的投资组合，你会感觉更富有，然后你会花更多的钱，所以股市对实体经济有影响。所以，如果股市出现非常持续的回调，我们就会看到一些这样的影响。现在，财富效应在消费上的估计多年来有所不同，但考虑到股票的“民主化”，我们可以预期影响会稍微大一些，但从整体来看，这种效应与去杠杆化事件相关的影响相比，往往非常小。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">with the GFC. And very simplistic way of putting this is whenever you have debt of various kinds, that's when you should be worried because Joe, as you said, it's when you're promised one $ one, but then you don't deliver. That's when, you know, there are sort of you repercussions throughout the economy. Now clearly with the equity markets there are wealth effects. So, you know, if you have a very large portfolio, you feel richer and then you spend more, and so there is a real economy effect of, um, of the stock market. So if they if we see a pullback in the stock market very sustained pullback, we will see, you know, some effect like that. Now the estimates of the wealth effect on consumption for example has varied over the, um, over the years, but, uh, given the if you like the democratization of stocks, we could we could expect a slightly larger magnitudes, but on the scale of things that effect tends to be very small compared to the kinds of effects</p>

**Hun Shin:** 与去杠杆化事件相关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that are associated with deleveraging episodes.</p>

**Tracy Alloway:** 你是否看到了目前没有得到足够关注的杠杆风险？

<p class="english-text">Do you see any pockets of leverage out there that aren't getting enough attention at the moment?</p>

</details>

**Hun Shin:** 但我认为，当然，记住其整体规模是值得的。是的。今年我们通过各种官方出版物谈论了很多的一件事是，即使是安全资产也可能成为市场压力的来源，因为它不是违约会传播压力。更多的是去杠杆化，我想，你知道，如果长期利率飙升，因此抵押贷款利率也飙升，你知道，那对实体经济来说将是一个大问题，即使没有任何违约也会发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh but I think it's certainly worth, uh, bearing in mind the broad magnitude. Yeah. One of the things that we've, um, uh, you know, we've talked about a lot this year in our various, uh, official publications is the fact that even, you know, safe assets can be a source of stress in the market because it's not default that, uh, you know, propagate stress. It's more the deleveraging and I think, um, you know, if let's say long rates were to, you know, shoot up and therefore mortgage rates, uh, also shoot up, you know, that would be a really big deal for the real economy and that would happen even without any defaults.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 顺便说一句，当我们开始这次对话时，10年期国债收益率低于4%。现在它高于4%了。

**Hun Shin:** 非常好。我的意思是，另一个有趣的事情是，如果黄金现在表现得像一种投机资产，那么当这一切开始逆转时会发生什么？你知道，你认为价值4000美元的东西不再价值4000美元，而黄金通常被用作抵押品，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Very good. I mean, the other interesting thing is if gold is acting like a speculative asset now, what happens when all of that starts reversing and you know, the thing that you thought was worth $4,000 is no longer worth $4,000 and gold is typically used as collateral, right?</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 嗯，我总是说，你知道，当你看到人们疯狂购买黄金时，真的很可怕，因为，怎么了？但是，真正可怕的是他们开始抛售黄金的时候，对吧？因为，这确实是真的，对吧？因为实际上没有人……

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 你必须是一个真正的疯子才会办理以黄金计价的抵押贷款。你有以美元计价的抵押贷款等等。所以当你看到，通常我注意到的一件事是，在真正的信贷事件中，当**VIX指数**（VIX Index: 芝加哥期权交易所波动率指数，衡量市场对未来30天市场波动性的预期）飙升，人们真正担心无法支付抵押贷款，真正担心无法支付每月订阅**彭博终端**（Bloomberg Terminal: 一款提供实时金融数据、新闻和分析的计算机软件系统）的费用时，他们需要美元，然后他们就会卖出黄金，你就会觉得，哦，情况真的变得很糟糕了。

### 美元地位的未来与“查克芝士”的比喻

**Bloomberg:** 音乐。

**Joe Weisenthal:** Joe，我总是喜欢和他聊天。他有一种非常舒缓平静的解释事物的方式。我确实这么认为。细微之处很重要。绝对。市场中的技术细节也很重要。所以，如果美元下跌被对冲行为而不是人们直接抛售美元所加剧，这是一个重要的话题，值得探讨和捕捉。

<p class="english-text">Joe, I always enjoy catching up with him. He has a fantastic way of explaining things in a very soothing calming manner. I do think so. I nuance is important. Absolutely.

So if the dollar going down is being exacerbated by hedging versus people selling dollars outright, that is an important thing to talk about and to capture.</p>

**Tracy Alloway:** 然而，

<p class="english-text">Play more games or eat more pizza</p>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 或者吃更多披萨。但我认为我们正处于这样一种境地：人们想继续玩游戏。他们只是不太喜欢整个游乐场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">or or eat more pizza. But I think we're in this situation where people want to keep playing the games. They just don't really like the whole arcade.</p>

<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 所以我想，因为，你知道，你不会在美国做生意，别开玩笑了。这完全不现实。即使你，正如你所说，不喜欢它的走向。所以我想，直观上你可以理解为什么我不想离开这个地方。我只是不想承担游乐场的风险。

I just don't want to have arcade exposure.</p>

**Tracy Alloway:** 绝对。我想我们需要的，是另一次大的危机，这样我们就可以观察黄金在那段时间的表现，以及美元在那段时间的表现。我想我会用这个比喻。实际上，我会用一个非常好的比喻，因为，你知道，查克芝士有很多有趣的游戏，但我也真的不认为查克芝士的商业模式那么好。比如……

Actually, I'm gonna run with a really good analogy because like like if you think like or you know Chuck-E-Cheese has a lot of fun games, but also I don't really think the business model of Chuck-E-Cheese is like that good. Like</p>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 你怎么敢？

<p class="english-text">how dare you?</p>

**Tracy Alloway:** 嗯，它们很多都倒闭了，但这并不意味着里面的游戏就不那么有趣了。所以，我不想永远把那些代币放在口袋里。我希望有风险敞口，以防它们倒闭或发生类似的事情。这并不会让游戏在此期间变得不那么有趣。你通过对冲解决了想玩游戏但又担心查克芝士未来的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, a lot of them have closed down, but the it doesn't mean the games inside were less fun. So, I don't want to hold those tokens in my pocket forever.

And you've solved this problem of wanting to play the games but being worried about the future of Chuck-E-Cheese by hedging them.</p>

**Hun Shin:** 嗯，这是另一个有趣的问题，因为代币和票据之间的兑换比率是多少？对吧？它们根本上是不同的，我不知道。这有点像那些共产主义国家。查克芝士，这是某人写的一篇论文。查克芝士是一个双循环经济，他们有用于游戏的代币和用于奖品的票据，他们如何管理这个兑换比率非常类似于计划经济。

<p class="english-text">well, this is another interesting question because what is the exchange ratio between a token and a ticket, right? And they're fundamentally different than I don't know. This is sort of like one of those communist countries. Chuck-E-Cheese, this is a uh paper that someone wrote. Chuck-e-Cheese is the dual circulation economy in which they have tokens for the games and tickets for the prizes and how they manage that exchange ratio is very similar to a planned economy.</p>
