### 全球秩序的裂痕与两种未来图景

近期，美国总统在社交媒体上发布了一张经过处理的图片，显示北约领导人围观一张地图，其中美国不仅控制了委内瑞拉，更令人震惊地占据了忠诚盟友——丹麦和加拿大的领土。这一举动在许多人看来如同疯子所为。然而，根据加拿大总理马克·卡尼（Mark Carney）的一段病毒式演讲，这恰恰是更大趋势的一部分：一个“大国竞争”时代正在回归，**规则导向秩序**（Rules-Based Order）正在消退，强权政治的逻辑——“强者为所欲为，弱者忍受一切”——正在重现。尽管卡尼对如何在新世界秩序中行事有着截然不同的愿景，但他关于大国竞争回归的观点，与特朗普外交政策的架构师之一斯蒂芬·米勒（Stephen Miller）近期在CNN上的表述不谋而合。米勒强调，现实世界由力量和权力主导，因此特朗普的新国家安全战略回归“**门罗主义**”（Monroe Doctrine）——美国历史上旨在将其他大国排除在西半球之外的政策——是合乎逻辑的。这意味着，美国将毫不掩饰地运用其军事力量来维护本半球的利益。一些学者，如韦斯·米切尔博士（Dr. Wes Mitchell），认为特朗普的行动根植于清晰且引人注目的“**宏大战略**”（Grand Strategy）逻辑，核心在于“**巩固**”（Consolidation）：通过巩固其在本半球的力量，美国旨在恢复实力，以便最终能与俄罗斯和中国等其他大国在新时代展开竞争。

The president of the United States
recently shared this photoshopped
image on social media showing
NATO leaders a map where the U.S.
has taken control of not only Venezuela,
but, more shockingly, territory
from loyal NATO allies that helped the US
fight several wars in the past decades.
Specifically, Denmark and Canada.
To many, this seems like something
only a madman would do.
But according to a viral speech
by Canadian Prime Minister
Mark Carney,
this is all part of a bigger trend.
This is a return to an era
of great power rivalry
that the rules based order is fading,
that the strong can do what they can,
and the weak must suffer what they must.
And while Carney
has a completely different
vision on how to behave
in such a new world order.
The overall idea that we are moving back
to an era of great power competition
is actually in line with what
one of the architects of Trump's
foreign policy, Stephen Miller,
recently told CNN's Jake Tapper.
But we live in a world in the real world,
Jake, that is governed by strength,
that is governed by force,
that is governed by power.
Therefore, it makes sense that Trump's new
national security strategy
literally says they are returning
to the so-called Monroe Doctrine,
under which the US has historically sought
to keep other
great powers
out of the Western Hemisphere.
This means that, according to Miller,
the US will now be using its military
to secure our interests
unapologetically in our hemisphere.
And that's exactly what we've seen
in the last few weeks.
Isn't it?
Therefore, some, like Doctor Wes Mitchell,
have said that Trump's actions are
in fact rooted in a clear
and compelling logic
grounded
in the discipline of grand strategy.
So what is this logic?
Well, one word consolidation.
Venezuela. Greenland. Canada.
The US is acting like a great power
that is consolidating its power
in its own hemisphere
to recover its strength first,
which will allow it to ultimately compete
with other great powers
like Russia and China
in a new era of great power competition.

然而，根据一篇近期广为流传的国际关系学论文的作者——斯泰西·戈达德教授（Professor Stacy Goddard）和亚伯拉罕·纽曼（Abraham Newman）——的观点，上述解释存在不足。他们认为，仔细审视后会发现，俄罗斯和中国在委内瑞拉及格陵兰周边的活动极为有限，且其资源成本过高，对美国并无真正益处。因此，他们提出，要真正理解特朗普对邻国和盟友的攻击，需要跳出“大国竞争”的视角，回溯到大国竞争时代之前——即那个由**争夺王位的皇室家族**主导、他们更关心**个人财富和个人地位**的时代。这种模式在人类历史的大部分时间里都主导着国际关系，正如《权力的游戏》（Game of Thrones）所描绘的那样，一群精英只关心如何在家族间重新分配资源。那么，我们是否可以认为，特朗普及其周围那些拥有炼油和矿产财富的亿万富翁构成了一个“宫廷”，而他们在委内瑞拉、格陵兰的行动，以及对中国最大竞争对手印度施加的高额关税，都指向了这种“**新王权主义**”（Neo-Royalism）的逻辑？这引出了核心问题：我们当前看到的新世界秩序，是特朗普与卡尼所代表的“大国政治”回归，还是更像是腐朽的“王室王朝”政治的复苏？

<details><summary>Original English</summary>
However, according to the authors
of a recent viral international relations
paper, Professor Stacy
Goddard and Abraham Newman,
this explanation does not make much sense
because actually, upon closer inspection,
Russia's and China's
activities in Venezuela and around
Greenland are extremely limited.
On top of that, their resources are way
too expensive to truly benefit the US.
Therefore, they argue
that to truly understand Trump's attacks
on neighbors and allies, we need to view
the new international order
through the lens of what came
before the era of great power competition.
The era of competing royal houses
that cared about
personal wealth and personal status.
To see how that works other than human.
You know, I think Sisi and I always give
the example of, Game of Thrones.
You know,
it's like every almost everybody on earth
relates to this show
about a small group of elites
who really don't care
about their societies in general.
They just care about redistributing
resources amongst these houses.
And that is a system
that for most of, of human
history,
dominated international relations.
So could it be
that if we view Trump as a neo royalist
and the refinery and mineral mining owning
billionaires around him as his court,
Venezuela, Greenland,
and also strangely high tariffs
against China's biggest rival, India,
it will all fall into place.
So who is right is the new world order
we are seeing right now a Trump versus
Ghani style
return to great power politics, or rather,
the return of the corrupt politics
of royal dynasties.

为了探究哪个叙事更能解释当前的新世界秩序，我们首先需要理解我们正在告别的——即**自由国际秩序**（Liberal International Order）的兴衰。1941年，在纽芬兰，温斯顿·丘吉尔（Winston Churchill）与富兰克林·罗斯福（Franklin D. Roosevelt）共同擘画了一个理想的国际秩序蓝图，旨在避免再次发生毁灭性的世界大战。他们确立了规则导向国际秩序的第一个支柱：国家拥有不可侵犯的边界，享有**自决权**，能够自由贸易并选择贸易伙伴，海洋则应保持开放以促进国际贸易。第二个支柱是经济层面，源于1944年的**布雷顿森林会议**（Bretton Woods）。44个国家齐聚一堂，旨在终结20世纪30年代和40年代的经济混乱。这次会议催生了一系列旨在建立秩序的国际机构：后来演变为世界贸易组织（WTO）的《关税与贸易总协定》（GATT），规定关税应平等对待所有国家；世界银行（World Bank），为所有贫穷国家提供发展贷款，不问其政治归属；以及国际货币基金组织（IMF），其贷款旨在稳定货币，其审批标准基于经济计划而非政治忠诚。第三个支柱是联合国（UN），一个由强弱国家组成的共同体，承诺遵守更多规则。通过1944年的**邓巴顿橡树园会议**（Dumbarton Oaks）、1945年的**雅尔塔会议**（Yalta）和**旧金山会议**（San Francisco），联合国得以成立。签署《联合国宪章》的国家承诺尊重人权、遵守国际法、仅为共同利益使用武力，并致力于促进全人类的经济与社会进步。这些崇高的目标，如同布雷顿森林体系一样，催生了理论上能限制国家单方面行动的国际机构，如授权战争的安理会和由国际法院（ICJ）追究责任的国家。此外，一些国家还加入了国际刑事法院（ICC），该法院曾起诉苏丹和刚果等国的领导人。

<details><summary>Original English</summary>
To find out, I did, on the one hand,
a massive deep dive into the fundamentals
and the history of great power politics
and how it compares to Trump's new
national security
strategy versus Ghani's speech.
And, on the other hand,
an in-depth interview with Professors
Godard and Newman.
But before we get into which story
can explain the New World order best,
we need to understand what we are leaving
behind.
That is the rise and fall of the rules
based liberal international order.
Newfoundland, Canada, 1941.
Churchill, arguably still the leader
of the most powerful empire
the world has ever seen.
Meets his counterpart from the richest
nation on Earth, Franklin D Roosevelt.
Together, they sit down to discuss what
they see as the ideal international order,
an order that would never again produce
another devastating world war.
And here
they've just agreed on the first pillar
of the rules based international order,
which means that nations have borders
that should be kept as they are.
They have a right to self-governance.
They have a right to trade freely,
and they can decide with whom they trade.
And finally, the seas should be kept open
to facilitate this international trade.
Now, the second pillar
of the liberal rules
based international order was economic.
And for that, we have to go back
to Bretton Woods, the United States, 1944,
44 nations come together
to put an end to economic chaos.
The economic case of the 1930s and 40s.
This conference sets the stage for
the following international institutions
that will create order.
Where before there was chaos,
the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade that would later
turn into the World Trade Organization.
This meant that tariff
should be the same for everyone.
Then there's the world Bank.
All poor countries should get loans
to develop independent
of their political allegiance
to certain great powers.
Then there's the IMF.
Getting loans
to save your currency from collapsing
will now depend on your economic program,
rather than your political allegiance
to certain great powers.
Finally, the third pillar of the rules
based order
was the UN, a community of states,
both strong
and weak, that all pledged to follow
even more rules.
1944 Dumbarton Oaks,
the United States 1945
Yalta, the Soviet Union, and finally 1945
San Francisco, the United States.
These conferences
led to the creation of the United Nations.
Countries
that signed the UN charter agreed
that they would respect
number one, human rights.
Number two, international law.
Number three, they signed that armed force
shall not be used
safe in the common interest.
And then finally, that the goal
of this new international order
was to promote the economic
and social advancement of all people.
Very lofty goals.
And just as with Bretton Woods,
this led to the creation of some
international institutions
which theoretically made it
more difficult for states
to act on their own in key areas like war,
which was only allowed
if the UN authorized it and justice states
were held accountable
by the International Court of Justice.
On top of that,
some states went even further
by signing up to the International
Criminal Court, which could and did
sue leaders from weaker states
like Sudan and the Congo.

然而，正如一位评论家所承认的，关于国际规则秩序的故事并非完全真实。我们知道，最强大的国家会在方便时豁免自己，贸易规则的执行是不对称的，国际法对不同身份的被告或受害者适用时，其严谨程度也各不相同。例如，国际刑事法院对普京和内塔尼亚胡发出了逮捕令，但他们几乎无法被触及。国际货币基金组织对埃及、希腊、阿根廷等小国实施的痛苦经济改革，远比对英国等大国严格。同样，联合国因侵犯人权行为制裁了津巴布韦和朝鲜等小国，却从未制裁过中国、苏联和美国等大国。尽管各国承诺不相互侵略（除非是自卫），但在所谓的“自由规则导向秩序”时期，东西方大国都曾入侵过多个国家。尽管如此，我们仍不能完全确定这些行为是否完全是规则秩序和国际机构的必然结果。回过头看，**自由国际秩序**似乎取得了巨大成功：没有发生新的世界大战，即使不考虑这些，1945年至2011年间国家间的冲突也相对少于之前的几十年。我们还可以看到，在该秩序下，国家间的关系平均而言变得更加友好，甚至出现了像北约这样的安全共同体。反观过去，法国、德国和英国等国家之间曾长期敌对，而在自由秩序下，这种严重或轻微的敌对关系大大减少。经济方面，在经历了全球范围内的巨大削减后，全球贸易爆炸式增长，更重要的是，全球贫困人口大幅减少。然而，尽管自由贸易在一定程度上帮助了数亿人脱贫（尤其是在亚洲），但在自由秩序的后半段，美国底层50%人口的收入份额却显著下降。因此，美国选出一位两次公开宣称要颠覆这一自由秩序的候选人，似乎也并非偶然。但我们必须承认，这一进程并非由特朗普一人开启。事实上，三个主要大国似乎都参与其中：2014年，联合国安理会常任理事国俄罗斯吞并了克里米亚，并在2022年从乌克兰手中夺取了其他几个省份。在经济层面，特朗普2018年的关税战已经完全破坏了低关税、普遍适用的原则。与此同时，中国通过成为贫困和危机国家的最大贷款国之一，积极削弱了国际货币基金组织和世界银行的作用。最后，中国和俄罗斯本就存在糟糕的人权记录，而美国在2003年布什和切尼政府授权使用酷刑的“黑狱”和关塔那摩事件后，也严重损害了其信誉。尽管如此，特朗普现在几乎每月都宣布对新国家征收关税，并威胁要吞并最忠诚盟友的领土，这确实像是给**规则导向国际秩序**敲响了丧钟。难怪卡尼说我们正经历的是一场“断裂”，而非“过渡”。自由的、规则导向的国际秩序已经死亡，这一点几乎无人争议。

<details><summary>Original English</summary>
But crucially, as Kony admitted,
we knew the story
of the international rules
based order was partially false
that the strongest would exempt themselves
when convenient,
that trade rules
were enforced asymmetrically.
And we knew that international law applied
with varying rigor
depending on the identity of the accused
or the victim.
For example,
the International Criminal Court
has issued arrest warrants
against Putin and Netanyahu,
but they are practically untouchable.
The IMF was far stricter, enforcing
painful economic reforms on small powers
like Egypt, Greece
and Argentina than against
strong countries like the UK.
Also, the UN sanctioned small powers
like Zimbabwe and North Korea for human
rights abuses, but never strong countries
like China, the Soviet Union and the US.
For similar offenses.
And despite countries
signing up not to invade one another
except for self-defense,
both Western and Eastern powers invaded
several countries during this so-called
liberal rules based order.
Still,
we cannot be 100% sure that this was
because of the rules based order
and international institutions.
And in hindsight, I think we can say that
the liberal international order
looked like a big success.
There were no new world wars, and even
without taking those into account,
the years from 45 to 2011 had relatively
fewer conflicts between states
than the decades before them.
We can also see that in the liberal order,
relations between countries on average
got much friendlier.
We even saw several countries
joining a security community in NATO.
And on the flip side,
we saw far less countries being in
severe or lesser rivalry
like France, Germany, in the UK,
which used to always
be at each other's throats.
Finally, on the economic side,
after a massive reduction in global terms,
we saw an explosion in global trade
and more importantly,
we saw a massive reduction
in global poverty.
And yet, while free trade under the rules
based international order
arguably helped drag millions
out of poverty, especially in Asia,
the bottom 50% of Americans
saw their share of income drop
remarkably, in the second half
of the liberal rules based order.
So it is perhaps no wonder that Americans
elected a candidate twice
that talked openly
about blowing up this liberal order.
But we have to be honest, it was not
just Trump that started this process.
The three great powers actually seem
to have been in on it together.
First, in 2014, member of the UN
Permanent Security Council Russia
annexed Crimea and then in 2022,
several other provinces from Ukraine.
Next, when it comes to the economic
pillar, Trump's
2018 tariff barrage already
completely undermined
the principle of low tariffs
that should be equal against all nations.
Meanwhile, China
actively undermined the IMF and world Bank
when it became one of the biggest lenders
to poor and crisis stricken countries.
Finally, both China and Russia already
had a terrible human rights record,
and honestly,
the US lost a lot of credibility in 2003.
And the Bush and Cheney,
when they essentially authorized
the use of torture in CIA black sites
and in Guantanamo Bay.
Still, Trump now almost announcing
new tariffs against a new nation
every month and threatening to annex
territories from its most loyal allies.
That genuinely looks like the final nail
in the coffin of the rules
based international order.
So no wonder that Carney said that
we are in the midst of a rupture,
not a transition.
The liberal, rules based
international order is dead about that.
Almost everyone agrees.

那么，接下来是什么？我们是走向卡尼和特朗普政府所设想的“大国竞争”时代，还是应该回溯更远，通过“**新王权主义**”的视角来理解特朗普的混乱行为，即新兴的“新国王”及其亿万富翁支持者群体（如特朗普王朝、普京家族和莫迪家族）的崛起？

**第一种观点**认为，我们正回归一个“**大国竞争**”（Great Power Competition）的新时代，其中特朗普和普京等大国领导人的愿景与卡尼等中等强国领导人的愿景截然不同。这意味着世界将更像18、19世纪乃至20世纪初的样子。国际关系学者通常称之为“**威斯特伐利亚全球秩序**”（Westphalian Global Order），它以1648年的《威斯特伐利亚和约》命名，该条约极大地削弱了皇室家族的权力，转而强化了民族国家及其官僚机构。在这种新的威斯特伐利亚秩序下，联合国、IMF和WTO等国际机构将失去其仅存的微弱影响力。世界将再次完全由美国、中国、俄罗斯，或许还有印度和欧洲等大国的行动决定。根据著名“**现实主义**”（Realism）学派的国际关系学教授约翰·米尔斯海默（John Mearsheimer）的观点，在这种秩序下，国家永远无法确定自己不会毗邻一个拥有恶意意图的强大国家。这促使各国竭尽所能地增强自身实力，并根据其最终实力被划分为大国、中等强国或小国，它们将扮演不同形式的权力游戏。小国要么寻求生存，要么依附于大国寻求保护。中等强国则可能试图利用大国之间的矛盾，或者采取卡尼所倡导的“**价值导向现实主义**”（Value-Based Realism），即像加拿大和芬兰这样的自由国家，在每种地缘政治情境下，都会权衡其自由价值观（如人权、尊重边界、民主）与地缘政治现实。这对加拿大而言是一个与过去的决裂，因为其前总理特鲁多（Justin Trudeau）曾频繁挑战中国等大国的人权记录，而卡尼则暗示加拿大可能不再这样做，如果这样做会招致大国的麻烦。对于未来的道路，也许自由价值导向的中等强国可以与其他价值观相似的国家结成联盟，以对抗价值观不同的强大国家，例如特朗普治下的美国。

The real question is what's next?
Are we heading back to an era
of great power competition like Carney
and the Trump
administration seem to believe?
Or should we think back
further, that Trump's chaotic actions
are better understood through the lens
of the emergence of new kings
and cohorts of billionaire backers
such as the Trump dynasty,
the House of Putin and the House of Modi?
Chapter two.
What will the new global
order actually look like?
The first
view is that we are now heading back
to a new era of great power competition,
where great power leaders like Trump
and Putin have a very different vision
than middle power leaders like Ghani.
This means that the world will look a lot
more like it
did in the 18th, 19th,
and early 20th centuries.
International relations.
Scholars tend to refer to this order
as the Westphalian Global Order.
After the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648,
which greatly reduced the power
of royal houses in favor of nation states
and their bureaucracies.
In this new Westphalian order, you may say
international institutions like the UN,
IMF and World Trade Organization lose
what's left of their waning power.
Instead, the world will once again
be completely determined by the actions
of great powers like the US, China,
Russia, and perhaps India and Europe.
According to international relations
professor John Mearsheimer,
who famously belongs to the school of
thought known as realism in such a world
order that states can never be certain
that they won't end up living next door
to a really powerful state
that has malign intentions.
All of that causes states
to do everything they can
to be as powerful as possible,
and depending on how powerful they end up
being, States are then classified
as great powers,
middle powers, or small powers,
and they will all play
a different variation of the power game.
First,
small powers will either try to survive
by claiming neutrality, like Sweden
and Belgium did in the Second World War,
or by aligning themselves
with a great power for protection
like Finland and Hungary did.
Meanwhile, middle powers will either try
to play great powers off against one
another like India has historically done,
or they will do the same
that Ghani suggested in his speech,
which is value based realism,
meaning that liberal countries
like Canada and Finland, for example,
for every geopolitical situation
they will weigh their liberal values,
such as the importance of human rights,
respecting boundaries and democracy.
And they will weigh that with geopolitical
reality, especially for Canada.
This is a break with the past concretely,
whereas Canada's previous Prime minister,
Justin Trudeau,
frequently challenged great powers
like China on their human rights records.
Ghani is subtly indicating
that Canada may no longer do this.
If the geopolitical reality is
that this would get Canada
into trouble
with a great power simultaneously.
Currently, in the case of the way forward,
maybe for a liberal value
based mill powers to form coalitions
with countries
with similar values that may help them
stand up to great powers
with different values,
such as Trump's America.
You see, while the Trump team also rides
in their national security strategy
that they believe in realism, now
they give a version of it a different name
flexible realism,
which so far seems to mean might is right.
A strong country like the U.S.
can take Greenland from Denmark,
because Denmark is a tiny country
with a tiny economy and a tiny military,
they cannot defend Greenland.
And this is what international scholars
mean when they say might is right.
The US should get Greenland
because it is strong enough to defend
Greenland from other great powers,
and Denmark is not.
But why does a great power like
the US need to do this in the first place?
Aren't they already powerful enough?
No. Say scholars like wertheimer,
without international commitments
to respect borders.
Even great powers like the US, Russia
or China will always fear that another
great power will become much stronger
than them, upsetting the balance of power.
Therefore, they may even want to dominate
your region of the world.
Is because in that situation,
there is no other state
that is capable of hurting you.
And this logic leads
to so-called spheres of influence,
where great powers
try to deny other great powers the ability
to threaten them
by keeping them as far away as possible.
In the 19th and 20th centuries,
the US tried to keep other great powers
out of the Americas under the so-called
Monroe Doctrine and using similar logic.
Hitler at some point actually proposed
a sphere of influence in Europe,
which he called the German
Monroe Doctrine,
and people like Professor
Mearsheimer have used this logic
of the Monroe Doctrine
to make the case that the West provoked
Russia into invading Ukraine
by meddling in its sphere of influence.
The Trump team has written
in the national security strategy
that they are essentially returning
to the Monroe Doctrine.
Some call it the donno
doctrine now, and some, like Doctor West
Mitchell, have used this type of logic
to argue that term strategic actions are
in fact rooted in a clear and compelling
logic, firmly grounded
in the discipline of grand strategy.
He says that Russia and China are the US
natural great power competitors,
but that the US no longer has the strength
to fight them all over the world,
and therefore the US is now essentially
retreating to its own Western Hemisphere.
Just this is done
historically, many times before.
Venezuela and Greenland are both
about securing access to vital resources
and, crucially,
about denying them to competitors.
So what we've seen so far is simply
a return to great power competition.
Everything the US has done
so far is just in the national interest.
Flexible realism is a cynical
but not illogical take on America First.
However, to me
there were at least three details
about recent events
that I could not explain with this theory.
First, capturing Maduro
does not seem to have been in US
national interest,
given that the oil there is too expensive
to get out of the ground,
and China did not get that much anyway.
Second, annexing Greenland
and in the process completely alienating
European allies does not make much sense
either, given that the US already
had almost unlimited
military access to the island
and easy economic access to its minerals.
Finally, if Trump was truly following
a great power style strategy,
why did he recently tear of the hell
out of India,
which is China's natural rival in Asia?
This is where Godard and Newman's
neo royalist theory
starts making a lot more sense.
They claim that
what we are seeing today is,
rather than a system of territorial nation
states, rather than a system of rule
governed institutions.
What we see
is a system of international politics
that structured
around the interest of ruling clicks,
which include a personalized,
absolute sovereign,
and basically his network
of whether or not his family,
whether or not its financial interests,
ideologues that legitimate his rule.
They call this neorealism
because rather than a return to great
power politics of the Westphalian order,
it would potentially be more like a return
to the world order
before the Peace of Westphalia in 1648.
You see, the Peace of Westphalia
came about to put an end to various
devastating wars that plagued the Holy
Roman Empire, Wars that often came about
because of royal succession,
not the national interest.
For example, the Dutch War of Independence
against Spain arguably came about
after that suddenly found themselves
with a new Spanish king that had
essentially inherited the Netherlands
through a series of marriages.
So in the royalist system,
the main actors were not states,
but rather ruling monarchs
and their clicks.
Therefore, most wars in those days were
not about the national interest at all.
They were about increasing royal wealth
and status.
Similarly, Godard and Newman argue
that in the case of Maduro's capture,
Greenland and the tariffs against India,
it's not about national interest.
It's about this small group of hyper
elites, these
this clique actor
kind of clusters interest.
And so that really drives
a very different logic
of how international politics functions.
So while Venezuela's oil is too expensive
to benefit the American oil industry
as a whole,
the specific American refineries
that did benefit just so happened
to be controlled by Trump Mega-Donors,
such as John Edison from Vidor.
Similarly, while Greenland's
minerals are not worth enough
for the US to alienate
allies over, that price
may well be worth it to billionaires
with extensive interest in Greenland
like Ronald Lauder, who reportedly
put the idea into Trump's head in 2018.
Finally, there's Trump's
mega tariffs against India.
Again, from a great Barr perspective,
it makes no sense to alienate
China's biggest Asian rival.
But if you consider that Modi
very publicly humiliated Trump by stating
that he had nothing to do with Pakistani
Indian fees in the summer, Indian tariffs
immediately after that incident start
making a lot more sense.
But while neorealism can fill
in a lot of gaps
in their article,
Goddard and Neumann do recognize that
the Royals dynamics
have always been in the background.
After all, even during the height
of great power politics,
the 19th century Belgian King Leopold,
for example, used the Belgian state
to conquer and dominate
his own personal colony in the Congo.
And even today, Trump style
personal rule is quite common.
However, the difference between MBS
or Orban and Trump is that they just don't
have the material or status capability
to transform the international system.
And that's why Trump is so exceptional,
because he has the U.S.
military and the U.S. economy behind it.
In other words, just as Westphalian style,
great power politics were always
still there in the background
during, for example, the Cold War.
Goddard and Neumann argue
that royalist elements are
and have always been a part
of the international order as well.
Therefore, my conclusion,
my conclusion
is that to truly make sense of where
the global order is going,
we need all three lenses.
If going, you can make international
organizations become more powerful again.
The global order will again
become more predictable.
But if they become weaker, we will either
see more great power games
where small and medium powers like
Ukraine, Venezuela and perhaps even Canada
become pawns or battlefields
for great powers that continuously seek
to become more and more powerful
because they fear that if they won't,
they will not remain a great power
for very long.
However, if great powers are governed
by autocratic or illiberal rulers,
then we will increasingly see incidents
like Trump's
Board of Peace, which he plans to stay on
even if he is no longer U.S.
president, where great power influence
will not be used in the national interest,
but rather to enrich Personalis leaders
and their clicks or elevate their social
standing amongst
a new class of global rulers
and their courts that compete very much
like the royal houses of game of Thrones
for power and status.
So, given that Trump will be in power
for at least
three more years, and given that far right
populist parties
are still lurking in the shadows
in many other middle powers as well,
I think it's a safe
bet that we will be seeing a more volatile
international order emerging, which,
whether it be for personal
or national interest, tariffs, sanctions
and even military strikes
and wars, will sadly become more common.
The economic evidence so far tells us that
this will make most of us
poorer and less secure,
especially given that,
unlike in the 19th century,
great powers now have weapons
that could kill us all
at the click of a button.
Still, it doesn't have to be that way.
For example, some have argued
that at the Congress of Vienna
after the body was defeated,
the return of realism looked inevitable.
Yet this never happened.
Similarly, who knows?
Perhaps Trump's successor
will see the value of the liberal,
rules based international order again,
and together with Geithner and others,
they may build yet
another liberal international order
from the ashes
of the one that we just said goodbye to.

特朗普团队在其国家安全战略中也声称信奉现实主义，但他们将其称为“**灵活现实主义**”（Flexible Realism），迄今为止似乎意味着“**强权即公理**”（Might is Right）。一个强大的国家如美国，可以从丹麦手中夺取格陵兰，因为丹麦国力微薄，无力保卫。这就是国际学者所说的“强权即公理”。美国应该得到格陵兰，因为它有能力保护它免受其他大国的侵害，而丹麦则不能。但一个像美国这样的大国，为何首先需要这样做？它们难道不已经足够强大了吗？不。正如学者们所说，没有尊重边界的国际承诺，即使是美国、俄罗斯或中国这样的大国，也永远担心另一个大国会变得更强，从而打破力量平衡。因此，它们甚至可能想要主宰你的地区，因为在这种情况下，没有其他国家有能力伤害你。这种逻辑导致了所谓的“**势力范围**”（Spheres of Influence），即大国试图通过将其他大国尽可能地排除在外，来阻止它们威胁自己。在19世纪和20世纪，美国试图依据“门罗主义”将其他大国排除在美洲之外。希特勒也曾提出过欧洲的势力范围，称之为“德国门罗主义”。米尔斯海默教授等人也曾引用这种门罗主义的逻辑，来论证西方通过干涉俄罗斯的势力范围而激怒了俄罗斯，导致其入侵乌克兰。特朗普团队在其国家安全战略中写道，他们基本上是在回归门罗主义，有些人称之为“**多诺主义**”（Donno Doctrine）。韦斯·米切尔博士等人也运用这种逻辑，认为特朗普的战略行动确实根植于清晰且引人注目的宏大战略。他认为，俄罗斯和中国是美国天然的竞争对手，但美国已无力在全球范围内与它们作战，因此美国正实质上退守到其西半球。历史上，这种情况曾多次发生。委内瑞拉和格陵兰的行动都关乎确保关键资源的可及性，并阻止竞争对手获得这些资源。因此，我们迄今所见的，仅仅是对大国竞争的回归。美国迄今为止所做的一切，都只是为了国家利益。“灵活现实主义”是一种愤世嫉俗但并非不合逻辑的“美国优先”的解读。

The Trump team has written
in the national security strategy
that they are essentially returning
to the Monroe Doctrine.
Some call it the donno
doctrine now, and some, like Doctor West
Mitchell, have used this type of logic
to argue that term strategic actions are
in fact rooted in a clear and compelling
logic, firmly grounded
in the discipline of grand strategy.
He says that Russia and China are the US
natural great power competitors,
but that the US no longer has the strength
to fight them all over the world,
and therefore the US is now essentially
retreating to its own Western Hemisphere.
Just this is done
historically, many times before.
Venezuela and Greenland are both
about securing access to vital resources
and, crucially,
about denying them to competitors.
So what we've seen so far is simply
a return to great power competition.
Everything the US has done
so far is just in the national interest.
Flexible realism is a cynical
but not illogical take on America First.

然而，对我而言，近期事件中有至少三个细节无法用“大国竞争”理论来解释。第一，抓捕马杜罗（Maduro）似乎不符合美国的国家利益，因为委内瑞拉的石油开采成本过高，而且中国并未从中获得多少利益。第二，吞并格陵兰并在此过程中彻底疏远欧洲盟友，也说不通，因为美国本已几乎拥有对该岛的无限军事准入，并能轻易获取其矿产资源。最后，如果特朗普真在遵循大国战略，为何他近期要严厉抨击印度的关税政策，而印度恰恰是中国在亚洲的天然竞争对手？

这时，戈达德和纽曼的“新王权主义”理论便显得更为合理。他们声称，我们今天看到的并非是领土国家或法治制度体系，而是一个围绕“**统治集团**”（Ruling Clicks）利益构建的国际政治体系。这个体系包括一个“**个人化、绝对主权者**”（Personalized, Absolute Sovereign）及其网络，涉及其家族、金融利益以及为其统治合法化的意识形态。他们称之为“新王权主义”，因为它并非回归“威斯特伐利亚秩序”下的大国政治，而是更可能回归到1648年《威斯特伐利亚和约》之前的世界秩序。要知道，《威斯特伐利亚和约》的达成是为了终结困扰神圣罗马帝国的各种毁灭性战争，而这些战争往往源于王位继承，而非国家利益。例如，荷兰对西班牙的独立战争，很大程度上是因为西班牙突然迎来了一位通过一系列联姻继承了荷兰的新国王。因此，在王权体系中，主要行动者并非国家，而是统治君主及其集团。故而，当时的多数战争并非关乎国家利益，而是为了增加王室财富和地位。同样，戈达德和纽曼认为，在马杜罗被捕、格陵兰事件以及对印度征收关税等案例中，关键并非国家利益，而是“**一小撮超级精英**”（Hyper Elites）、“**集团式行动者**”（Clique Actor）的利益集群。这驱动着一种截然不同的国际政治运作逻辑。例如，委内瑞拉的石油虽然对整个美国石油产业而言过于昂贵，但那些受益的特定美国炼油厂恰好由特朗普的“**超级捐助者**”（Mega-Donors）控制，如来自维多（Vidor）的约翰·埃迪森（John Edison）。同样，格陵兰的矿产对美国来说不足以疏远盟友，但对那些在格陵兰拥有广泛利益的亿万富翁，如罗纳德·劳德（Ronald Lauder，据报道他于2018年向特朗普提出了这一想法）而言，其价值可能足以支撑这一代价。最后，特朗普对印度的巨额关税，从大国博弈的角度看，疏远中国在亚洲的最大对手毫无意义。但如果考虑到印度总理莫迪（Modi）曾公开羞辱特朗普，声称与巴基斯坦在夏季的事件无关，那么印度关税的立即实施就变得更容易理解了。

However, to me
there were at least three details
about recent events
that I could not explain with this theory.
First, capturing Maduro
does not seem to have been in US
national interest,
given that the oil there is too expensive
to get out of the ground,
and China did not get that much anyway.
Second, annexing Greenland
and in the process completely alienating
European allies does not make much sense
either, given that the US already
had almost unlimited
military access to the island
and easy economic access to its minerals.
Finally, if Trump was truly following
a great power style strategy,
why did he recently tear of the hell
out of India,
which is China's natural rival in Asia?
This is where Godard and Newman's
neo royalist theory
starts making a lot more sense.
They claim that
what we are seeing today is,
rather than a system of territorial nation
states, rather than a system of rule
governed institutions.
What we see
is a system of international politics
that structured
around the interest of ruling clicks,
which include a personalized,
absolute sovereign,
and basically his network
of whether or not his family,
whether or not its financial interests,
ideologues that legitimate his rule.
They call this neorealism
because rather than a return to great
power politics of the Westphalian order,
it would potentially be more like a return
to the world order
before the Peace of Westphalia in 1648.
You see, the Peace of Westphalia
came about to put an end to various
devastating wars that plagued the Holy
Roman Empire, Wars that often came about
because of royal succession,
not the national interest.
For example, the Dutch War of Independence
against Spain arguably came about
after that suddenly found themselves
with a new Spanish king that had
essentially inherited the Netherlands
through a series of marriages.
So in the royalist system,
the main actors were not states,
but rather ruling monarchs
and their clicks.
Therefore, most wars in those days were
not about the national interest at all.
They were about increasing royal wealth
and status.
Similarly, Godard and Newman argue
that in the case of Maduro's capture,
Greenland and the tariffs against India,
it's not about national interest.
It's about this small group of hyper
elites, these
this clique actor
kind of clusters interest.
And so that really drives
a very different logic
of how international politics functions.
So while Venezuela's oil is too expensive
to benefit the American oil industry
as a whole,
the specific American refineries
that did benefit just so happened
to be controlled by Trump Mega-Donors,
such as John Edison from Vidor.
Similarly, while Greenland's
minerals are not worth enough
for the US to alienate
allies over, that price
may well be worth it to billionaires
with extensive interest in Greenland
like Ronald Lauder, who reportedly
put the idea into Trump's head in 2018.
Finally, there's Trump's
mega tariffs against India.
Again, from a great Barr perspective,
it makes no sense to alienate
China's biggest Asian rival.
But if you consider that Modi
very publicly humiliated Trump by stating
that he had nothing to do with Pakistani
Indian fees in the summer, Indian tariffs
immediately after that incident start
making a lot more sense.
But while neorealism can fill
in a lot of gaps
in their article,
Goddard and Neumann do recognize that
the Royals dynamics
have always been in the background.
After all, even during the height
of great power politics,
the 19th century Belgian King Leopold,
for example, used the Belgian state
to conquer and dominate
his own personal colony in the Congo.
And even today, Trump style
personal rule is quite common.
However, the difference between MBS
or Orban and Trump is that they just don't
have the material or status capability
to transform the international system.
And that's why Trump is so exceptional,
because he has the U.S.
military and the U.S. economy behind it.
In other words, just as Westphalian style,
great power politics were always
still there in the background
during, for example, the Cold War.
Goddard and Neumann argue
that royalist elements are
and have always been a part
of the international order as well.

尽管“新王权主义”可以填补许多理论空白，但戈达德和纽曼也承认，王室动态始终存在于背景之中。毕竟，即使在大国政治的鼎盛时期，例如19世纪的比利时国王利奥波德（King Leopold），也曾利用比利时国家来征服和统治他在刚果的私人殖民地。即使在今天，特朗普式的个人统治也相当普遍。然而，与沙特王储穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼（MBS）或匈牙利总理欧尔班（Orban）不同的是，他们缺乏改变国际体系的物质或地位能力。而特朗普之所以如此特别，是因为他拥有美国军力和美国经济的支持。换言之，正如威斯特伐利亚式的大国政治在冷战期间始终存在于背景中一样，戈达德和纽曼认为，王室主义元素也一直存在于国际秩序之中。

因此，我的结论是，要真正理解全球秩序的走向，我们需要综合运用这三种视角。如果国际组织能够再次变得强大，全球秩序将再次变得可预测。但如果它们变得更弱，我们将看到更多的大国博弈，小国和中等强国（如乌克兰、委内瑞拉，甚至加拿大）将沦为大国争夺的棋子或战场，因为大国将不断寻求变得更强大，它们害怕一旦停止增长，就无法维持其大国地位。然而，如果大国由专制或非自由主义的统治者领导，那么我们将越来越多地看到类似特朗普“和平委员会”（Board of Peace）的事件——他计划即使不再担任美国总统也继续留任。在这种情况下，大国的影响力将不再用于国家利益，而是用于充实个人领导者及其集团的腰包，或提升他们在由全球统治者及其宫廷组成的新阶层中的社会地位，这些宫廷将像《权力的游戏》中的王室家族一样，为权力和地位展开激烈竞争。鉴于特朗普至少在未来三年内将掌权，并且极右翼民粹主义政党仍在许多其他中等强国暗中活动，我认为可以肯定地说，我们将目睹一个更加动荡的国际秩序的出现。无论是出于个人还是国家利益，关税、制裁甚至军事打击和战争，都将不幸地变得更加普遍。迄今为止的经济证据表明，这将使我们大多数人变得更贫穷、更安全感更低，尤其考虑到，与19世纪不同，大国现在拥有只需点击按钮就能毁灭我们所有人的武器。尽管如此，情况并非必然如此。例如，有人认为，在滑铁卢战役后维也纳会议期间，现实主义的回归似乎不可避免，但事实并未发生。同样，谁知道呢？也许特朗普的继任者会再次看到**自由国际秩序**的价值，并与盖特纳（Geithner）等人一起，在刚刚告别的秩序废墟上，重建一个新的自由国际秩序。
