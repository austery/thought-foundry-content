title: 市场收盘分析：财报季风云再起，特朗普暗示新任美联储主席人选
---

### 市场概览与财报预告

好的，大家好，欢迎回到新一期的《市场收盘》直播节目。我们有很多内容要讨论，此外，还有大量的财报需要解读。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market close. We are live and we have a lot to discuss. On top of that, we have a lot of earnings to get into.</p>
</details>

今天将要公布财报的公司包括：Pure Storage、Marvell、GitLab、Asana、Crowdstrike、American Eagle 和 Okta。所以，你会看到一个混合体，包括半导体公司、软件公司——今天的财报更偏重于软件行业——然后是零售商 American Eagle。今天有许多不同类型的公司发布财报。我们将在大约 15 分钟内拿到这些财报数据。财报发布后，我们会有“技术分析星期二”环节，大概在 4:20 或 4:30 左右。但我们确实有很多财报要分析。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is what we have up on the day for earnings. Pure Storage, Marvell, GitLab, Asana, Crowdstrike, American Eagle, and Octa. So, you got a mix between Semiconductors, software names, more software heavy on today's earnings, and then American Eagle, which is retailers. So, you got a lot of different companies reporting today. We will be getting those earnings in about 15 minutes. We will have technical Tuesday after the earnings, probably around 4:20, 4:30. Uh, but we definitely have a lot of earnings to get into.</p>
</details>

### 特朗普暗示新任美联储主席人选

自开盘以来，我们已经看到了许多不同的头条新闻。上次我们结束直播时，特朗普正在举行内阁会议，但说实话，我们从那次会议中并没有得到太多信息。即使在问答环节，也只是一些零星的评论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, since the market opened, we've had a bunch of different headlines come out. We last left when Trump was doing the cabinet meeting, and we honestly didn't get too much from that cabinet meeting. Even in the Q&A, I mean, there were a couple comments here and there.</p>
</details>

我们真正得到的最重要的信息是，凯文·哈塞特 (Kevin Hassett) 成为下一任**美联储主席** (Federal Reserve Chair: 美国联邦储备系统理事会主席，负责制定美国的货币政策) 的可能性，在**预测市场** (Prediction Markets: 一种利用市场机制来集合信息、预测未来事件结果的平台) 上，这个影子美联储主席的赔率已经上升到了 83%。为什么会这样呢？这是特朗普在他下午 2 点的公告中所说的。我们稍后会讨论那个公告是关于什么的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What we actually got, which was the most important thing, is the odds of Kevin Hassid becoming the next Fed chair, the shadow Fed effectively on prediction markets rising to 83%. Why did that happen? Well, this is what Trump had to say at his 2pm announcement. We'll talk about what that announcement was for in a second.</p>
</details>

特朗普说道：“我想感谢大家来到这里。这是一个很棒的团队，我猜一位潜在的美联储主席也在这里。我不知道是否允许这么说，潜在的。我可以告诉你们，他是一个受人尊敬的人。谢谢你，凯文。今天是‘捐赠星期二’，所以我们有很多特别的人和我们在一起。” 然后他又说：“我猜一位潜在的美联储主席也在这里。我不知道，我们能这么说吗？谢谢你，凯文。” 这似乎很明显，这件事将会发生，凯文·哈塞特将成为美联储主席。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Joe Gibia, I want to thank you all for being here. It's a great group and I guess a potential Fed chair is here too. I don't know who's allowed to say that potential. He's a respected person that I can tell you. Thank you, Kevin. Today is giving Tuesday. So, we have a lot of special people here with us. Uh, and then he says, "Maybe I guess a potential Fed chair is here, too. I don't know. Are we allowed to say that?" Thank you, Kevin. Seems kind of obvious that this is going to happen. Uh, and Kevin Hassid is going to be the Fed chair.</p>
</details>

现在，预测市场并没有将凯文·哈塞特的概率定在 95% 或 97%。即使在这些评论之后，他们仍然将他定在 85% 或 83%。他昨天大概是 78%。所以你确实看到了一个提升，但凯文·沃什 (Kevin Warsh) 和其他一些可能担任该职位的人并没有完全退出竞争。这对市场是利好吗？是的。基于凯文·哈塞特可能成为下一任美联储主席的预期，**联邦基金期货** (Fed Futures: 一种金融衍生品，用于预测和对冲未来联邦基金利率的变化) 的降息概率甚至更高了。早上我们是 86%，现在是 89.2%。我的意思是，我们几乎可以肯定会得到这次降息。所以，这是利好消息，市场需要这个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, prediction markets don't have Kevin Hassid at 95 or 97%. They still have him at 85% even after these com or 83%. He was at like 78% yesterday. So, you did get a bump up, but not fully out of the race from Kevin Worsh and some of the other people that potentially could be at that chair. Uh, is this bullish? Yeah, I mean, probabilities on the Fed futures went even higher based on Kevin Hasset potentially being the guy who is going to be the next Fed chair. We were at 86 in the morning. We are now at 89.2. I mean, it's all but guaranteed that we're going to get this rate cut. So, I mean, it's bullish and the market needs that.</p>
</details>

### “投资美国”计划与市场影响

那么，今天大盘发生了什么？**标普500指数** (Standard & Poor's 500: 标准普尔500指数，一个广泛衡量美国大型上市公司股票表现的指数) 相对上涨。今天整体是上涨的一天。你看到了一些下跌的板块，但大多数下跌的板块实际上是上周上涨的板块，也就是医疗保健股和市场广度扩大的交易。资金开始回流到科技股。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, broader market, what happened today? S&P 500 relatively green. It was it's been an overall green day. You have some pockets of red, but most of those pockets of red are actually the pockets that were going green last week, which were your healthcare names and the broadening out trade. Starting to come back to tech.</p>
</details>

顺便说一下，下午 2 点的公告是关于“投资美国”(Invest America) 账户的。迈克尔·戴尔 (Michael Dell) 宣布了 62.5 亿美元的捐款，这将为 2500 万人每人增加 250 美元到他们的投资账户中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By the way, the 2PM announcement was for the Trump accounts in Invest America. It was with Michael Dell announcing that $6.25 billion donation, which is going to be $250 for 25 million people added to their Invest accounts.</p>
</details>

如果你算一下这些“投资美国”账户的数学题，这意味着 2500 万个孩子一出生就能在一个标普500指数基金中获得 1250 美元。如果你看一下应该会发生什么的轨迹——让我在这里调出这个数据——到这些孩子 60 岁的时候，他们应该有 30 万美元。所以从 18 岁到 60 岁，如果你假设标普500指数每年回报 10%（这并非保证），他们应该有大约 32 万或 31 万美元。这很酷，能让人们对金融生态系统产生兴趣，并让他们参与其中。迈克尔·戴尔做出这笔捐赠绝对是一件大事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By the way, um if you do the math on these Invest America accounts, that means 25 million kids are now going to get effectively $1,250 as soon as they're born into an S&P 500 fund. And uh if you look at the let me just pull this up right here, trajectory of what should happen. So by the time these kids are we're looking at 60, they should have $300,000. So from 18 to 60, if you assume S&P 500 returns 10% a year, which is not guaranteed, they should have about 320 grand or 310 grand. Uh, pretty cool. I mean, pretty cool to get people interested into the financial ecosystem and give them a skin in the game. And the fact that Michael Liddell is making that donation is definitely a big deal.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为早上所有认为下午 2 点的公告是关于特朗普账户的人，是的，就是关于这个。那么，Robinhood (Hood) 会从中分到多少羹呢？没人知道。我们知道布拉德·格斯特纳 (Brad Gerstner) 一直在与 Robinhood 密切合作，以建立这项倡议。Robinhood 已经演示了这些账户在其平台上的样子。顺便说一下，Meta 股价达到了当日高点 647 美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think for everyone in the morning who thought that the 2M announcement was going to be about the Trump accounts, yeah, that's what it was about. Now, how much will Hood get of that? No one knows. We know that Brad Gersonner has been working very intimately with Robin Hood to be able to set up this initiative. Robin has already demoed an example of what these accounts will look like on their platform. I don't think, by the way, Meta right there, their high of day 647.</p>
</details>

我认为 Robinhood 不会得到所有这些账户。显然，如果你的父亲使用嘉信理财 (Schwab) 并且他们有了新生儿，那么新生儿的钱很可能会放在他们父母使用的平台上，比如嘉信理财。但随着越来越多的千禧一代开始生孩子，如果我们有孩子的话，并且我们使用 Robinhood，那么我们的孩子很可能也会使用 Robinhood。所以我确实认为这 2500 万账户中会有一部分流向 Robinhood。但更重要的是，这意味着有更多的人在投资，这对 Robinhood 来说难道不是好事吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think Hood's going to get all those accounts. Obviously, if your, you know, dad uses Schwab and they have a newborn, the newborn's probably going to have that money on the platform that their parents use, like Schwab. But as more millennials start to have kids, if we ever have any kids, um, and we're using Robin Hood, then most likely our kids will have Robin Hood. So, I do think there will be a chunk of those 25 million that go to Hood. But more importantly, it's just more people investing, which isn't that good for Robin Hood.</p>
</details>

### 个股动态与市场脉搏

Robinhood 股价在 126.91 美元，上涨了 3%。MicroStrategy 实际上上涨了 6%。比特币今天也有一个不错的反弹。开盘时曾达到 92 美元，早上时是 83 美元，所以从 83 美元反弹到 92 美元是很好的现象。苹果股价创下历史新高，达到 287 美元，成为一家 4.23 万亿美元的公司。英伟达股价为 181.50 美元，我们稍后也会讨论一个关于英伟达的头条新闻。Snowflake 上涨 3%。Applovin 今天表现出色，上涨 4%。Costco 也上涨了 1%。BMR 上涨 11%。谷歌正试图冲击 315 美元。Reddit 上涨 0.24%。你看到整个市场都充满了动力。Palantir 曾达到 175 美元，现在回到 170 美元，但整个市场仍然相当绿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Robin right there 12691 that's up 3%. Micro strategy actually up 6%. Bitcoin also a nice little rebound on the day. It did hit 92 during the market open. It hit 83 in the morning. So that 83 to 92 reversal was nice to see. Apple all-time highs hit 287 4.23 trillion company. Nvidia at 18150. We have a headline invidia that we'll talk about in a second as well. Snowflake that's up 3%. Applovin great day that's up 4%. Costco's even up 1%. BMR up 11%. Google's trying to hit 315. Reddit's up 0.24. I mean, you're just seeing a lot of momentum across the board. Pounder was at 175, now back at 170, but still pretty green uh across the entire market.</p>
</details>

IREN 股价下跌了 13%。我没看到 IREN 会下跌 13%。关于**可转换票据** (Convertible Notes: 一种债务工具，可以在特定条件下转换为发行公司的股权)，我不是专家，因为我不了解它们。我具体不了解 IREN 发行的那些票据。但我读到一篇分析说，这些可转换票据对股东不是最友好的。我的意思是，并非所有的可转换票据都有很多细微差别，但有些可以非常有效。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Iran, right? Wow. 13. Okay. I didn't see Iran being down 13%. Uh the convertible notes I am not an expert on because I don't know them. I I don't specifically know the ones that Iran issued. Um but I think there's something there. But I was reading one piece of analysis that it's just not the most shareholder friendly these uh these convertible notes. I mean not every convertible notes have a lot of different nuances to them but some of them can be very effective.</p>
</details>

例如，当 MicroStrategy 在 2024 年以 0% 的票息获得所有这些资金，并且他们基本上用这些钱在 50,000 到 60,000 美元的价格购买比特币时，那不是最坏的主意。你知道，那些是不同类型的可转换票据。IREN 不是用它来购买比特币，也不是购买一种能超过他们必须支付的债务利息的资产。他们正在尝试建造数据中心，这是非常资本密集型的。所以我不确定市场到底是如何解读的，但 IREN 正处于大规模回调中。该股曾达到 80 美元，现在是 40 美元。所以你谈论的是 50% 的回调。现在的问题是它是否会反弹？但 IREN 在这里下跌了 13%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So for example when Micro Strategy was getting all this money in 2024 at a 0% coupon and they were essentially taking that money buying Bitcoin at 50,000 60,000 that was not the worst idea. You know those are different types of convertible notes. Iran's not buying Bitcoin with it and and buying an asset that's going to outperform the interest they have to pay on the the debt, which in Micros um they're trying to build data centers which are very capital intensive. So I'm not sure exactly how the market's interpreting it, but IN's in a you know massive correction. The stock was at 80, now it's at 40. So you're talking about a 50% correction. Question now is does this rebound? But I ran right here down 13%.</p>
</details>

Nebius 也没有保持上涨。是的，Nebius 回到了 97 美元，下跌了 3%。Coreweave 早上是 82 美元，现在回到 76 美元，也下跌了半个百分点。我不知道 ALAB 发生了什么。它曾上涨 10%，现在下跌 13%。一定发生了什么基本面的事情，导致这只股票受到重创。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nebas as well I don't think held on to the green. Yeah, Nebius back to 97. That's down 3%. and Cororeweave was at uh 82 in the morning back to 76. So that is down half a percent as well. I do not know what happened to ALAB. It was up 10. Wow. 13%. If anyone has the analysis, I didn't see anything today. I I mean, I just saw a bunch of people posting technical charts. It was up 10%. Now it's down 13. Something fundamental had to take place for this one to get hit.</p>
</details>

我会在聊天中发起投票，看看哪只股票会表现更好。让我知道你们拥有这些股票中的哪一只。我认为 Marvell 是今天大多数人持有的最重要的一只。哪一只会表现更好？我们有 CrowdStrike、Marvell、Okta，我想我们还会把 American Eagle 放上去。让我们看看 American Eagle 能否跑赢这些公司。Okta 和 AEO。GitLab 是另一个可能因为亚马逊而变得更令人兴奋的名字。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'll put the poll in the chat for which one outperforms. Let me know which one of these stocks own. I think Marll is the biggest one that most people has most people have today. Which one outperforms? Uh we have Crowd Strike, Marll. What was the other one? Um Octa and I think we'll put put American Eagle up there. Let's see if American Eagle can outperform some of these names. Octa and then AEO. GitLab is another one that might be a more exciting name that gets up there because of Amazon.</p>
</details>

我不太了解亚马逊和 ALAB 之间的关系。但如果是这样的话，亚马逊推出了那些训练芯片，让市场兴奋了大约 5 秒钟，然后股价就又回落了，从 238 美元跌到 234 美元。当他们宣布那些东西时，确实从英伟达那里分走了一点市场份额。我们稍后会更深入地探讨亚马逊的公告，但现在股价是 234.80 美元，上涨了约 0.39%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I don't know too much about the relationship between uh between Amazon and ALAB. But if that is the case, Amazon introduced those training three trips, got the market excited for like 5 seconds, then it went right back down 238 down to 234. Definitely chipped off a little bit of Nvidia when they announced that stuff. And we'll go deeper into the Amazon announcement later, but that's at 23480 up about.39%.</p>
</details>

Oaklow 当天上涨 6%。特斯拉基本持平。沃尔玛上涨 1%。标普500指数在 681.90。苹果再次达到 285 美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oaklow up 6% on the day. Tesla basically flat. Walmart's up 1%. Then the S&P 500 at 681 90 on the day. Apple again at 285.</p>
</details>

### 财报前瞻：Marvell 与 CrowdStrike

市场对这些财报有什么预期？顺便说一下，在我们进入这个话题之前，让我快速分享一下这个。还记得 American Bitcoin (ABTC) 吗？埃里克·特朗普 (Eric Trump) 的公司，股价下跌了 37%。基本上，是的，内部人士可以出售了。他今天发推文说：“今天，我们合并前的私募配售股份解锁了。这些早期投资者首次可以自由地兑现他们的利润，这就是为什么我们会看到波动。我们的基本面在我们的差异化中几乎是无与伦比的，以现货价格的 50% 开采比特币，第三季度毛利率为 56% 并且还在攀升，比特币排名每天都在上升。我也会持有我所有的股份。” 所以，确实有内部人士卖出了，这是不可避免的。根据他的推文，不是埃里克·特朗普，但尽管如此，你还是看到了一些痛苦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, what is the market expecting for some of these earnings? And by the way, before we get into that, let me just share this real quick. Remember American Bitcoin, ABTC, Eric Trump's uh company that's down 37%. Uh basically, yes, insiders were able to sell. He tweeted today, today are pre- merger private placement shares unlocked. These early investors are freely available to cash in on their profits for the first time, which is why we will see volatility. Our fundamentals are virtually unmatched in our differentiation, mining Bitcoin at 50% of spot with 56% gross margins in Q3 and climbing the Bitcoin ranks daily. I'm also holding all my shares. So, you did have insiders that sold, which was inevitable. Uh it was not Eric Trump as per his tweet, but nonetheless, you did get a bit of pain.</p>
</details>

是的，我们将在财报后进行技术分析星期二，大概在 4:25 左右。所以一旦我们分析完财报，我们就会进行技术分析。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, we will have technical Tuesday after the earnings probably around 4:25. And so once we get through the earnings, we will have TT.</p>
</details>

关于英伟达，我认为这一点非常重要。英伟达的首席财务官在一次瑞银 (UBS) 会议上，以下是他们关于与 OpenAI 合作关系的说法。引述是：“目前，5000 亿美元的预测不包括我们正在进行的与 OpenAI 协议下一部分的任何工作。我们相信我们将继续与 OpenAI 合作，我们尚未完成最终协议，但我们正在与他们合作。” 所以，你看到 OpenAI 的首席财务官说：“嘿，黄仁勋 (Jensen) 在 GTC 上谈到的五个季度 5000 亿美元的收入，那不包括中国，也不包括我们在 9 月底与 OpenAI 宣布的任何事情，即那个价值 1000 亿美元、10 吉瓦的大规模合作关系。” 所以，英伟达的市盈率是明年盈利的 25 倍，而有两个主要因素还没有包含在指引中。如果这些因素中的任何一个能带来帮助，那对英伟达来说可能是一个真正的巨大推动力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh on Nvidia. I thought this was really important to look at. So the Nvidia CFO was at a UBS conference and here's what they said about the OpenAI partnership. Uh right now the quote is that 500 billion does not include any of the work that we're doing on the next part of the agreement with OpenAI. We believe we'll continue working with OpenAI and we still have not completed a definitive agreement, but we're working with them. So, you've got the OpenAI CFO saying, "Hey, that 500 billion in five quarters that Jensen talked about um in GTC that doesn't include China and it also doesn't include any of the stuff we announced with OpenAI at the end of September in that massive hundred billion dollar 10 gigawatt partnership that both companies came to agreement on. So, I mean, you got Nvidia turning at 25 times next year's earnings with two major things that are not included in the guidance. You get any of those things to help that might be a real big tailwind for Nvidia.</p>
</details>

英伟达今天收涨。如你所见，科技股几乎全线上涨。那些没有上涨的股票是一些之前轮动进去的股票，现在当天收跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nvidia right there. Green on the day. As you can see, tech pretty much green across the board. The names that uh didn't end up going green were some of the red ones or were some of the the the names that got rotated into that are now red on the day.</p>
</details>

让我们来预览一下 Marvell 和 CrowdStrike。我们在这里获取一些报道，然后在大约五分钟内，我们应该就能知道今天这些财报会是什么样子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A little bit of preview on Marll and Crowd Strike. Let's get some coverage right here and then in about five minutes, we should get some answers on what these earnings will look like today.</p>
</details>

> **记者1**: Marvell 是芯片领域一个重要的组成部分。是的，因为它也是一家与博通 (Broadcom) 竞争的定制芯片制造商。所以有三个关键领域需要关注。首先，博通问题。分析师表示，博通已经赢得了与大多数主要参与者的客户合作，这引发了人们对 Marvell 是否真正适合这个竞争格局的担忧。你可以看到过去一年里两家公司股价的差异。Marvell 是红色的，博通上涨了 129%。其次，亚马逊的情况。自 2024 年底开始增长以来，Marvell 的 AWS 业务季度环比基本持平。与同行在人工智能项目上的增长相比，这令人失望。还有一些关于 Marvell 在亚马逊 Trainium 芯片中所占份额的具体担忧，一些分析师认为该公司已经输给了竞争对手。AWS 在今天的活动中没有提到 Marvell。最后但同样重要的是，第三，首席执行官的信任票。马特·墨菲 (Matt Murphy) 在 9 月下旬以每股约 77 美元的价格购买了 100 万美元的股票。此后，该股表现优于 SOX 指数，但投资者想知道他看到了什么他们没有看到的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Important piece of the chip puzzle. Yes, because this is also a custom chipmaker that competes with Broadcom. And so there's three key areas to focus on. First, the Broadcom problem. Analysts say Broadcom has won customer engagements with most of the major players, raising concerns about whether Marll actually fits into this competitive landscape. And you can just see the difference in the stock prices over the last year. Marll and the red brought come up 129%. Second, the Amazon situation. Marbell's AWS business has been essentially flat quarter over-arter since ramping in late 2024. Disappointing compared to Piers growths in AI projects. There are also specific concerns about Marbell's share in Amazon Tradian chips with some analysts suggesting the company has lost ground to competitors AWS did not mention Marbell today at their event. And last but not least, third, the CEO vote of confidence. Matt Murphy bought $1 million of stock in late September at around 77 bucks. uh shares have outperformed the socks index since then, but investors want to know what he sees that they're missing.</p>
</details>

> **记者2**: CrowdStrike，迈克，今年表现非常出色，这也反映在了它的股价上，正如你刚才提到的。在 2025 年，它的股价上涨了超过 50%，这是基于人工智能正在加速网络安全需求的赌注，因为不良行为者变得越来越复杂。所以华尔街今晚想从首席执行官乔治·库尔茨 (George Kurtz) 那里知道的是更多关于新客户赢得的证据。它最近收购的 Pangia Technology 如何用于保护人工智能代理，并被整合到整个技术栈中。库尔茨最近分享说，公司的代理可以通过追捕恶意软件来加快分类处理过程。库尔茨还补充说，在某个时候，安全将完全自动化。他没有提供时间表。我们今晚看看他是否会提供。该股目前交易价格比最近的高点低约 10%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Crowd Strike, Mike, has been killing it this year, and that's reflected in its stock price as you just mentioned. It's up over 50% in 2025 on this bet that artificial intelligence is accelerating the need for cyber security as bad actors get more sophisticated. So what Wall Street wants to know from CEO George Kurtz tonight is more evidence on new customer wins. How its latest acquisition of Pangia technology is using to secure AI agents is being integrated into the full stack. Curts recently sharing that companies agents can speed up the triage process by hunting down malware. Curts also added that at some point security will be fully autonomous. He didn't provide a timeline. We'll see if he does tonight. The stock is currently trading about 10% off its most recent high. Mike.</p>

### 财报季揭晓：多家公司业绩盘点

好的，我认为 CrowdStrike 和 Marvell 是大家关注的重点。数据中心相关的股票现在开始出现一些抛售。再说一次，我通过持有 Nebius 学到了这一点。现在，看到这里的波动性，我认为在过去几周里，这对我影响不大，因为这些都是波动性很大的股票。我的意思是，如果你持有 IREN、Coreweave、Nebius，你投资它们是为了那些 10%、15% 的大涨日，但伴随着上涨的波动性，也会有下跌的波动性。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> All right. So, Crowd Strike and Marll, I think, are the big ones that everyone's looking at. You got the data center names that are now starting to get into a little bit of a sell-off. Again, I've learned this with owning Nebius. Now, like seeing the volatility here, I just I I think over the past couple weeks, it's not affecting me as much because these are volatile names. I mean, if you own Iran, Cororeweave, Nebius, you're getting into them for the massive 10 15% days, but with that volatility to the upside comes the volatility to the downside.</p>

所以，任何关于数据中心的负面消息都可能让这只股票回到 80 美元。如果 Oracle 发行更多债务，市场可能会生气。Coreweave 的**信用违约互换** (Credit Default Swap (CDS): 一种金融衍生品，允许投资者对冲或投机特定公司或主权实体的信用风险) 开始飙升，Nebius 可能会受到连带损害。IREN 昨天有 20 亿美元的稀释。我认为这对 Nebius 或 Coreweave 影响不大，但尽管如此，它可能会拖累所有这些股票。

<p class="english-text">So, I mean, this thing could go back to 80 on any bad data center headline. If Oracle issues more debt, the street could get mad. Cororeweave's uh credit default swap starts spiking up. Nebas could get hit as collateral damage. Irre had this $2 billion dilution yesterday. I don't think it affects Nebius or Corweave that much, but nonetheless, it might be taking down all of them.</p>

Cipher 和 Wolf 在周三分别上涨了 11%，现在当天都下跌了 10%。这两家公司也都得到了谷歌的支持。Wolf 实际上跌了 7%。所以，我认为当你持有这些股票时，除非你的成本基础非常低——有些人很早就进入了这些股票——如果你在这里买入，你买入的是它们的上涨和下跌，它们比市场上的传统股票波动性大得多。所以，这就是投资这些数据中心股票所伴随的情况。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So, I think it's And then Cipher and Wolf were up 11% each on Wednesday. Both of them now down 10% on the day. So, and both of them are cosigned by Google as well. Wolf actually down 7%. So I think when you own these names, unless you're owning them from a very low cost basis, which some people, you know, got into these names really early. If you're buying them here, you're buying them for the ups and for the downs and they're much much more volatile than a traditional stock in the market. So it's just it's just what comes with game on these data center plays.</p>

Reddit 当天收红。Vertiv 上涨 0.92%。谷歌在 315 美元。标普指数在 681 点。对于标普指数来说，基本上是平盘的一天。我可以接受。别把我们打回到 650 点。如果我们能停留在 680 点，那完全没问题。

另外，给大家一个有趣的事实，明天，12 月 3 日，是 12 月的季节性底部。从 1950 年到 2024 年，12 月 3 日一直是底部。所以，谁知道呢？也许明天你会看到一点向下的波动，那将是我们的底部。如果不是，那么我们将看看这个 12 月会如何发展。但这是我们在进入 12 月第三个交易日时需要关注的一件事。

好了，至少在常规交易时段，今天的股市交易已经结束。标普指数收于 681.43，当天基本持平。英伟达上涨了约 1.50 美元。Coreweave 下跌约 1.34%。Nebius 下跌 3.69%。Nebius 早上曾达到 101 美元，所以再次说明，这只股票的波动性相当惊人。

IREN，我得研究一下为什么华尔街如此讨厌这些可转换票据，但市场确实不喜欢它，下跌了 15%。这似乎不仅仅是对稀释的反应，更像是对稀释类型的反应，因为在这些数据中心公司中，稀释是不可避免的。所以我们得看看华尔街到底不喜欢什么。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Iran, I I got to do some work on why the street absolutely hated these convertible notes, but the street did not like it. 15% down on Iran.

可能是算法交易导致 IREN 下跌？我不认为 15% 的跌幅仅仅是算法交易。如果所有数据中心股票都在像 IREN 一样大跌，那么是的。我认为是有其他人，无论是机构股东还是散户投资者——我怀疑是散户，因为散户在 IREN 上非常坚定——不喜欢他们发行的可转换票据。所以我们得更深入地看看那里发生了什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Could it be ALOS on Irene? I don't think a 15% move is just ALOS. If all the data center stocks were like bleeding like I then yes I think this is something that someone whether it's an institutional shareholder or retail investors and I doubt it's retail because retail is really diamond hands on IN there's someone else that is not loving the convertible notes that they issue and so we'll have to look deeper into seeing what's happening there.</p>

好了，让我们来看看财报。我们应该很快就能得到结果了。盘后有什么情况？Pure Storage 曾上涨 7%，现在盘后上涨 1%。我们很快就会得到这些数据。Marvell 当天上涨 2%。GitLab 当天上涨 5%。Asana 当天上涨 4%。CrowdStrike 当天上涨 2%。American Eagle 当天实际上是下跌的。然后 Okta 上涨 2%。所以很多这些股票都是上涨的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, let's get into earnings. We should be getting results pretty soon. What do we have after hours? Pure Storage was up 7%. It's now up 1% after hours. We'll start getting these numbers soon. Marll was up 2% on the day. GitLab was up 5% during the day. Asana was up 4% during the day. Crowd Strike was up 2% during the day. American Eagle was actually down during the day. And then Octa was up 2%. So, a lot of these names were green.</p>
</details>

我们将看看它们在盘后的表现如何。市场对它们有什么期望？让我们把这个调出来。CrowdStrike，市场预期每股收益 94 美分，营收 12 亿美元。Marvell，市场预期每股收益 74 美分，营收 20.7 亿美元。GitLab，他们预期每股收益 20 美分，营收 2.39 亿美元。Okta，他们预期每股收益 76 美分，营收 7.3 亿美元。Pure Storage，每股收益 58 美分，营收 9.56 亿美元。American Eagle，他们预期营收 13.2 亿美元，每股收益 44 美分。Asana，他们预期每股收益 6 美分，营收 1.98 亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and we're going to see how they perform after hours. Now, what does the market want from them? Uh, let's just pull this up right here. Crowd Strike Street wants 94 cents and 1.2 billion in revenue. Marll Street wants 74 cents and 2.07 billion of revenue. GitLab, they want 20 cents, 239 million of revenue. Octa, they want 76 cents a share and 730 million of revenue. Pure Storage, 58 cents, and 956 million of revenue. And American Eagle, they want 1.32 billion of revenue and 444. And so those are the expectations. A sauna, they want 6 cents of EPS and 198 million of revenue.</p>
</details>

Okta 的财报出来了。盘后转跌约 1%，不算太疯狂。Okta 营收 7.42 亿美元，高于预期的 7.3 亿美元，营收超预期。预期每股收益 76 美分，实际为 82 美分，每股收益也超预期。股价持平，市场不太在意，但这就是 Okta 的财报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Octa, do we have it? Octa goes red after hours by about 1%. Not too crazy. Octa revenue 742 million. Um, Octa, it's a beat on the top and the bottom. 742 versus 730. That's a beat on revenue. 76 cents expected, 82 cents earned. That's a beat on EPS. Stock is flat. markets not caring too much, but those are your earnings for Octa.</p>
</details>

Okta 不算是市场上波动最大的股票，它不怎么那样波动。今年迄今，该股上涨了 4%，是一家 140 亿美元的公司。所以这就是 Okta 的情况。我认为 Marvell 和 Crowdstrike 将是我们关注的主要焦点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Octa is not necessarily the most volatile name that's out there. Doesn't really move like that. Year to date, this stock is up 4%. 14 billion company. So, that's what you have on Octa. I think Marll and Crowdstrike are going to be the main main ones that we look at.</p>
</details>

我们早上也谈到了 Netflix 和华纳兄弟探索公司的交易。Netflix 已经正式提交了全现金收购要约。现在，拉里·埃里森 (Larry Ellison) 非常想要 HBO Max 和华纳兄弟。所以也许派拉蒙 (Paramount) 会提出更高的报价，但 Netflix 正在尝试看他们是否能收购它。我越想越觉得这很有道理。我的意思是，Netflix 需要非常好的知识产权。每次你在 Netflix 上看一部不是他们制作的节目，它都会显示“五天后下架”之类的，对他们来说，要获得真正好的内容真的很难。而 HBO 拥有这些内容。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, that's what we have on Octa. Let's see if we can get some more of these numbers as we get into the close. And we talked in the morning about the Netflix Warner Brothers Discovery deal as well. Netflix has officially submitted a allcash offer. Um, now Larry Ellison really wants HBO Max and Warner Brothers. So maybe Paramount comes in with a higher offer, but Netflix is trying to see if they can acquire it. And the more I think about it, the more I think it makes a lot of sense. I mean, Netflix needs really good IP. And every time you get it into a show in Netflix that's not made by them, they have, you know, it's like leaving in five days or something, it's like really tough for them to just get really good content. And HBO would have that.</p>
</details>

CrowdStrike 盘后小幅上涨 1%。American Eagle 上涨 2%。哦，American Eagle，涨幅更大了，5%。是西德尼·斯威尼 (Sydney Sweeney) 的功劳吗？让我们看看她能不能做到。

That's getting a bigger candle. 5%. Sydney Sweeney pump. Let's see if she can do it. Let's see if she can do it.</p>
</details>

我还没有两家公司的数据。上个季度她可是个大新闻，因为她的广告引起了很多争议。所以，如果说有什么影响的话，那就是让更多的人谈论这件事。American Eagle 上涨 4.2%。CrowdStrike 上涨 1%。GitLab 上涨 5%，受到了一些追捧。谷歌本应在 2021 年收购 GitLab，他们当时在收购股份，但最终没有完成收购。但 GitLab 现在上涨了 5.3%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Still don't have the numbers on either. I mean, she was a big deal last quarter as she got into a lot of controversy with the ad and all that stuff. So, I mean, if anything, that got a lot more people to talk about. American Eagle up 4.2%. Crowd Strike up 1%. GitLab, that one's up 5%. GitLab getting some love. Uh, Google was supposed to buy GitLab back in 2021. like they were acquiring shares and then they just never ended up making the acquisition. But GitLab right there, that's up 5.3%.</p>
</details>

Pure Storage 下跌了。Pure Storage 下跌了 6.4%。Okta 现在下跌了 2%。Asana 上涨了 7%。GitLab 刚刚转为平盘。Marvell，这是重头戏，下跌了 2%。让我们看看是否会逆转。

<p class="english-text">Pure Storage is down. Pure Storage is down 6.4. Octa's now down two. Asana's up seven. GitLab just went flat. Marll, this is the big one. That's down two. Let's see if that reverses. Maybe we can get a little bit of a different print there.</p>
</details>

好的，Marvell 的每股收益超出预期 3%，为 76 美分，预期为 74 美分。营收与预期持平，为 20.7 亿美元。营收同比增长 37%，每股收益同比增长 77%。市场不喜欢这个结果，至少不足以给他们一个溢价。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Okay, we got Marll beat by 3% on EPS 76 cents versus 74 cents expected. Revenue came in line with expectations 2.07 billion. Revenue is up 37% year-over-year. EPS is up 77% year-over-year. Street does not like it, at least not enough to give them a premium.</p>
</details>

Marvell 与亚马逊关系密切，正如我们之前谈到的。Marvell 股价下跌 1.87%，这是一家价值数十亿美元的公司。在六个月的时间框架内，这只股票反弹得非常好，正如你所看到的，9 月份达到了 60 美元。现在是 92 美元，低于 104 美元。所以即使在 11 月的回调中，从 104 美元跌到 92 美元也不算太疯狂，特别是因为它从 60 美元涨上来的，但股价仍然下跌了约 2%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Marbell is uh intertwined with Amazon as we talked about before. Marbell right there down what 1.87% billion dollar company. This one has rebounded really nicely on the six-month time frame as you can see right there in September hit 60 bucks. Right now 92 down from 104. So even in the November draw down 104 to 92 is not that crazy especially because it's up from 60 but stock still down about 2%.</p>
</details>

哇，Pure Storage 下跌了 15%。我还没有他们的数据。让我看看能不能找到 Pure Storage 的数据。这又是一家 SaaS 公司，做企业数据存储等很多不同的事情。天哪，PTSG 下跌了 17%。

</details>

他们说了什么？CrowdStrike 的财报还没出来。Pure Storage 的营收超出预期 1%，为 9.64 亿美元，预期为 9.56 亿美元。他们的每股收益与预期持平。他们肯定在指引方面说了些什么，才会引起这种反应。下跌了 18%。

</details>

Marvell，有人可能会说他们的产品很有粘性，但看起来蜘蛛侠也不会来救他们，尽管他也有一些粘性的网。所以，Marvell 当天下跌了 3%。GitLab 仍然下跌 6%。CrowdStrike 现在转为下跌，但我们还没有 CrowdStrike 的数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, it's not a read. It's a SAS company and it's being pretty sassy right here. 17% down. Marll, you know, one could argue their products are sticky, but uh it's not it's not seeming like like Spider-Man is going to come save them even though he also has some sticky webs. So, Marll right there down 3% on the day. GitLab still down 6%. Crowd Strike now going red, but we don't have numbers on Crowd Strike yet.</p>
</details>

GitLab 的数据出来了，每股收益 25 美分，预期为 20 美分，超出预期 25%。营收 2.44 亿美元，预期为 2.39 亿美元，超出预期 2%。每股收益同比增长 19%，营收同比增长 25%。GitLab 也没有得到任何青睐，即使是双重超预期，也下跌了 4%。

好的，所以 Asana 是唯一一个受到青睐的。CrowdStrike，我们还没有数据。我预计 CrowdStrike 会有好的数据，但我不知道股价是否真的会有大的波动。记住，Crowdstrike 是除了 Palantir 之外最昂贵的软件公司。它今年已经上涨了 48.7%。所以，这只股票需要一个非常好的季度，市场才会继续给它一些青睐。

<p class="english-text">Okay, so Asana is the only one getting some love right here. Crowd Strike, we don't have the numbers yet. I expect Crowd Strike to have good numbers.

Wow, I didn't even know it was up 48.7% this year. So, this one's going to need a really big quarter for the street to keep giving it some love.</p>
</details>

Asana，哇，他们的每股收益超出预期 17%，为 7 美分，预期为 6 美分。营收 2.01 亿美元，预期为 1.98 亿美元，超出预期 1%。每股收益同比增长 450%，营收同比增长 9%。看起来这足以让市场兴奋起来。

</details>

> **记者**: Marvell 的业绩超出了预期，但不是大幅超出。第三季度每股收益为 76 美分，比市场预期高出 3 美分。第三季度营收为 20.8 亿美元，也略高于预期。第四季度营收指引为 22 亿美元，也略高于 21.7 亿美元的预期。数据中心营收为 15.2 亿美元，也略高于市场预期。公司还宣布了对 Celestial AI 的收购，这可能会影响股价的负面反应，以及业绩超出预期幅度不大的事实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Say beat but not a massive beat. Yeah. earnings per share of uh 76 cents, three cents higher than what the street anticipated. This is for Q3. Uh Q3 revenues coming in at 2.08, just slightly slightly higher. Uh for Q4 revenue guidance, 2.2 billion, also a little bit higher than the 2.17 billion. Uh data center revenue that contributes a lot to their bottom line. Uh data center revenue came in at 1.52 billion for the quarter, which was also just slightly higher than street estimates. Uh the company also for gross margins a little bit higher but not by much. 59.7 for Q3, 59% for Q4. They are announcing though in their press release that they are excited to announce the acquisition of Celestial AI. This was a rumor from uh the information earlier today, but now they're confirming uh that it's going to help with their um the fastest growing opportunities in AI data center infrastructure. So they're confirming that. So that could possibly be contributing to the uh the the negative reaction in the stock and the fact that the um beat was not that big.</p>
</details>

CrowdStrike 的财报出来了。营收 12.3 亿美元，预期为 12.1 亿美元，超出预期。每股收益 96 美分，预期为 94 美分，也超出预期。这是一个双重超预期。第四季度营收指引为 12.9 亿至 13 亿美元，略高于 12.9 亿美元的预期。全年营收指引为 48 亿至 48.1 亿美元，也超出了预期。他们提高了指引的下限，但没有提高上限。这不应该导致股价下跌，但也许也不值得大幅上涨。

<p class="english-text">Earnings 1.23 billion versus 1.21. That's a beat. EPS 96 cents versus 94 cents. That's a beat. You got a double beat. Revenue 1.29 to 1.3 for Q4. That is a beat against the expectations. A very slight beat against the 1.29 expectation. And then fiscal year revenue 4.8 to 4.81. That is a beat. Well, not really because originally the street thought it would be 4.75 to 4.81. So, they increased the low end of their guidance. Didn't increase the high end. Not something the stock should be dumping off by any sense of the imagination, but maybe not something that deserves a massive move higher.</p>
</details>

股价现在正在反转，上涨了 1%。之前曾下跌。红色蜡烛图没有太大意义，所以它正在反转。问题是，我们会反转多大？顺便说一下，Pure Storage 曾下跌 18%，现在只下跌了 10%。Marvell 下跌了 7%。这只股票刚刚下跌了 2%，现在正在崩溃。GitLab 下跌了 7%。

That's after its splashy campaign with Sydney Sweeney. While the campaign didn't have a major impact on sales, operating margin did come in better than expected at 8.3%. John,</p>

这太不可思议了。American Eagle、Best Buy、Burlington、Abercrombie。看看这个，当天上涨了 13%。这不仅仅是炒作，这是基于将全年指引上调 4 倍，并将每股收益超出预期 20%。这相当惊人。

Marvell 仍然下跌 7%。CrowdStrike 勉强维持。CrowdStrike 有一些指引，他们有信心在 2027 年实现 20% 的净新增**年度经常性收入** (Annual Recurring Revenue, ARR) 增长，这提高了对 2026 年 ARR 的预期。如果你听乔治·库尔茨的话，他作为首席执行官最关心的一件事就是他们能为业务带来多少更多的年度经常性收入。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Marll still down 7%. Crowd Strike barely holding on. You do have uh some guidance. crowd strike confident in delivering 20% net new ARR growth for 2027 um which is increasing the expectation from 2026 ARR if you listen to George Curts he that is the number one thing he cares about as a CEO is how much more annual recurring revenue they can bring to the business</p>
</details>

首席执行官说：“CrowdStrike 是安全人工智能转型的推动者，拥有正确的架构、正确的产品和正确的执行力。第三季度是我们公司历史上最好的季度之一。我们实现了创纪录的 2.65 亿美元的第三季度净新增 ARR，同比增长 23%。我们的单一平台战略，加上 Falcon Flex 订阅模式，释放了整合的潜力，将 CrowdStrike 定位为网络安全的操作系统。我们在端点业务以及云安全领域的期末 ARR 增长都实现了加速。”

<p class="english-text">that's why all of their um press releases kind of start off with that metric as you can see right here record Q3 net ARR of 265 million that's up 73% year-over-year overall ARR at 4.92 billion up 23% % year-over-year. CEO said, "Crowd Striker is the enabler of secure AI transformation with the right architecture, the right products, and the right execution. Q3 was one of our best quarters in company history. We achieved record Q3 net new ARR of 265 million, which accelerated 23% year-over-year. Our single platform strategy coupled with the Falcon Flex subscription model unlocks consolidation, positioning crowd as the operating system of cyber security. We delivered an acceleration in ending ARR growth across our endpoint business as well as in cloud security.</p>
</details>

首席财务官说：“我们交付了出色的第三方业绩，超出了所有指引指标的预期。总营收同比增长 22%。” 这不坏，而且他们有 50 亿美元的现金。所以 CrowdStrike，即使股价没有变动，你也确实有一些相当不错的财报。如果你在年初买入，你已经上涨了 50%，所以不能太不高兴。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh the CFO said, "We delivered outstanding third-party results, exceeding expectations across all guided metrics. Total revenue is up 22% yearover-year." Not bad. And they've got five billion in cash. And they've got five billion in cash. So you got Crowd Strike. Even though the stock's not moving, you do have some pretty decent earnings. And you know, if you bought it early in the year, you're up 50%. So can't be too upset.</p>
</details>

Marvell 仍然在试图理解为什么会这样。我知道 2026 财年的营业利润率指引比预期低了一点，但仍然下跌了 6%。Pure Storage 下跌了 10%，而 American Eagle 并没有停止，当天上涨了 15%。

### 技术分析环节：标普500指数展望

> **Amit**: 好了，各位。今天是星期二。谢谢大家来到这里。以上是财报更新。我们将进行一系列的**技术分析** (Technical Analysis, TA: 通过研究历史市场数据，主要是价格和成交量，来预测未来价格走势的方法)。对于那些不熟悉技术分析的人来说，它本质上是看图表，并试图根据各种不同的变量来预测股票的表现。这不是每个人的菜，所以如果这不是你的菜，也没关系。但我非常尊敬一位懂技术分析的人，他是亚洲版的史蒂夫。是时候播放开场介绍了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">All right, folks. It is Tuesday. Thank you everybody for being here. Those were the earnings updates. Uh we are going to get into a bunch of technical analysis for those that aren't familiar with TA. It's essentially looking at charts and trying to make predictions based on a variety of different variables on how a stock will perform. Based on looking on the charts, not everyone's cup of tea. So, if it's not your cup of tea, that's okay. But there is someone who I deeply respect who understands TA. And uh he happens to be the Asian version of Steve. It is time to roll the intro.</p>

</details>

> **Amit**: 我们有很多要谈的。我们上次是在周二谈的，当时市场正开始从 11 月的一些下跌中恢复。当时成交量很低，因为我们正进入感恩节。所以，你可以调出标普指数的图表，683 点，离历史高点不到 1%。我的意思是，如果这次降息真的发生，感觉真的有机会出现一些上涨动力。所以，我想知道你在想什么？你怎么看标普500指数？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Um, we got a lot to talk about. We last talked on Tuesday when the markets were starting to recover from some of the November downside. Now, that was on low volume as we were getting into Thanksgiving. So, you can pull up the S&P 683, less than 1% away from all-time highs. I mean, it really does feel like there is a shot if we get this rate cut for some momentum to occur. So, I guess what are you thinking? How are you seeing the S&P 500?</p>
</details>

> **Jason**: 市场有三个方向：上涨、下跌和横盘。现在我会说，这是一个横盘的时刻，至少在过去的两三天里是这样。所以我认为我们正在为下一次波动做准备，方向待定。

<p class="english-text">>> Um, so it is Sorry, I got a lot of lines here. Should I start? Yeah, >> we have a timer. First of all, and I I've been posting at least just general updates. Um, and I know Emit does this. Uh, by the way, did you guys see the thumbnail that he almost used? He thought about it. I don't know how how long he thought about the thumbnail, but we had a He spent all this time putting together this thumbnail. It was very, very thoughtful. >> Did you Did you post it? Because I thought you were going to post it. >> What do you mean >> the thumbnail? because you said he was he was gonna do he was he was gonna do the thumbnail. >> This was gonna be the new the new show. What do you guys think? >> Hold on. This should be the thumbnail. Like >> that's what I was saying. >> 22 minutes ago I was live so I didn't even think of it. I like this should legit every Tuesday.

It wasn't bad. >> Did you donate today? >> Also, so I'm totally We're just We're just catching up. But I did uh I post It's It's Giving Tuesday. This is my I don't we donate to scout troops every now and this is my picture of me as a boy scout back in that's legit me way back in the 90s. >> I'll put that >> if you guys need some uh tax deductible gains for sure. Actually, you could click this little link. I just pinned it. But um but anyways, moving on. I'll I'll put the link in the chat. I cannot believe that's you, dude. That's That's wild. >> Yeah, this is 90s, man. N Well, I'm an 80s baby. >> How old were you were like what 10, 12? >> No, I'm uh How old am I here? This is probably 15. >> Okay, >> so maybe like late 90s. Late 90s. I was a boy. Look at the Boy Scouts. Hey, and if you guys if you guys have Boy Scout pictures, like reply in there, cuz like all the Boy Scout pictures of everybody, like this is pretty badass. Sorry, but this is pretty cool to see everybody's like memories coming up of like way back when. Like it's it's way cool. But anyways, yeah, good times, man. >> That's awesome. >> But so let's get on with the show, if you will. Um, you know how quickly we forget where we just were like not even that long ago. It's it it blows my mind. Um, oh yeah, just scouts now. Sorry. Um, it blows my mind how like we were just down here at these like at these lows. Literally like >> I was not a Girl Scout. Stop saying that. >> Well, girl are cool, too. And we here we are 5% in 11 days. um in the in the last couple days we haven't actually gone anywhere. Um and so that has me a little bit I think we're so the market goes three directions. They go up, they go down and markets go sideways also. Right now I will say this is this is one of those sideways moments the last few days at least few as in three two or three days. uh and so I think well so we are gearing up for another move in what direction that direction is TBD</p>
</details>

> **Jason**: 上次我们在这里时，我说过，我们应该能达到 675 点。如果我们能有几次收盘价高于 675 点，那我们应该就没问题了，我们做到了。所以我们有一次开盘和收盘，实际上我们有三次。所以，一、二、三次收盘价都高于 675 点。所以这看起来不错。我现在唯一的问题是下一个水平，我们已经到了，是 681 点。所以我们必须再做一次这个过程，但我们还没能做到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and and amidst uh what do you call that like the the preface of the segment if you will is it's it's not what did you call it when you first met me uh astronomy astron like male astrology is >> I didn't say that but other people say that often >> okay but you said it but >> I I think it's useful, but you know, that's what people >> to to to those people's credit, it's kind of like being a weatherman sometimes. And I saw a comment and something's like I can say like, "Hey, look, it's cloudy outside and it might rain and sometimes it might rain the next day. Sometimes it might rain right away. Sometimes it might rain a little bit, you know, later on. But if there's storms brewing, then there's storms brewing. whether or not they hit you right like right smack in the face right away that that's kind of actually pretty pretty legit uh in terms of an analogy. Um so meteorology I guess you could you could you could call it that. Um but it's good to know what the weather's going to be like if I'm going to go out. Do I want to wear a sweater? Do I want to wear shorts today or what? Right. Um so anyways it it's it's something like that. So, so right now we're we're very close. For a while when the government was shut down, we were the the market has been and still is using uh ADP numbers in in the absence, if you will, of NFP numbers. Now, we did get NFP numbers just recently and and the last time we were here, I said, um, look, we should we should actually make it up to 675. And if we can get a couple closes above 675, which we have, um, then we should be good. So we got one open and close, right? So this is one, we got two and actually we got three. So one, two, three closes above NFP like this 675. And so this looks good. The only issue I have right now is that the next level, and this is the way that this works, is that if we get we get there, then we go to the next level. Well, the next level we're already there. We we hit it like right away. It's 681. So, we have to do this process one more time and we we have not actually been able to do it.</p>
</details>

> **Jason**: 如果我们不能守住，那没关系，那我们就重新测试这个 675 点，看看它是否能守住，然后我们就可以有这种情况，那将是理想的。所以，我们现在所处的位置，是一个高风险区域，不适合投入新资金做多。因为你的风险回报远不如这里好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, 681 in my post has actually been a pretty pretty big level. Um, and if we if we can't hold, well, cool. Then we'll just retest this 675 and see if it holds here and then then we can have this kind of situation. That would be ideal. So, where we are right now, it's a high-risk area to press new money long. long way to say that. Um because your riskreward is is not nearly as good as it was down here. Not nearly as good. And we have a lot of traffic above us.</p>
</details>

> **Amit**: 而那里只是两周前。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And down down there was just two weeks ago.</p>
</details>

> **Jason**: 是的，这里只是两周前。这是一个更好的位置，可以进行轻度对冲，而不是卖出大量看涨期权，但我不介意购买便宜的下行保险。实际上，我不介意。这条红线是主要的下降趋势。所以，如果我们能超过 685.88，也就是我们上一个高点附近，那么我们应该可以确定地看到 700 点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And down here was just two week two weeks ago. This is a better spot to to do a light hedge in terms of not wanting to sell a whole lot of upside calls, but I don't mind buying cheap downside insurance. Actually, I don't mind that. Um and this red line here is the prevailing downtrend if you will. So um in terms of our trend count from from a market perspective, trend count meaning series of higher highs and higher lows. This was our last high. This was our last low. We locked in a lower high. We actually locked in a lower low. Lower high. Lower low. You can kind of finagle it however you want, but if we can get over 68588, which was pretty much our last high right around here, then and we're very close to it, then we should definitively at least now we're looking at 700s. And that is how we get to those 700s.</p>

### 关键科技股技术分析

> **Amit**: 说到深度探索，我们先来看看英伟达这只股票。我的意思是，这只股票的价格走势对我来说有点奇怪。我想知道你是怎么看待它守住 180 美元的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> so speaking of Deep Seek, let's just do Nvidia as the first stock. I mean, the price action on this one has been kind of weird to me. I wonder how you're thinking about this holding 180.</p>
</details>

> **Jason**: 我认为它可能会跌得更深一点。我的意思是，它确实重新测试了这个下限。我认为它可能不错。我认为它可能还行。但情况类似，如果它不能突破这里的主要交通区域，现在这里过去一直是阻力位。所以，从各方面来看，我实际上必须假设这是阻力位。它看起来是建设性的，但作为一个交易者，在这里投入新资金做多是高风险低回报的定义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Um, so I I I thought it would go down a little bit deeper. I mean, it did retest this lower end. I think it could be good. I think it could be okay. But it's it's a similar situation where like if if this can't get through this major traffic zone here right now, this is and has been resistance in the past. So for all intents and purposes, I actually have to assume that this is resistance. It it looks constructive. But new money long here as a trader this is the definition of high risk low reward.</p>
</details>

> **Jason**: 我们喜欢在支撑位买入，不喜欢在阻力位买入。这是一个很好的经验法则。但我们太习惯于突破性市场了。我需要它超过 200 美元。这实际上是一个很好的防守性持仓。所以我认为这很有可能就是现在的情况。如果它能再高一点，突破这个阻力区，那么我认为在那个时候，做多就是一个风险较低的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um down here it's better. So so we like to buy at support. We don't like to buy at resistance as a trader typically speaking. Um I I mean it's just a good rule of thumb to operate by to buy at support not buy at resistance in general for life. Um, but sorry, but but you know, we're so used to to breakout markets. You know, I I saw this one coming here. It didn't really get through the I needed to get over 200. This is actually a this is actually a good defensive hold right here. So, I think that this has a strong possibility of being it right now. Um, and if it can get a little bit higher and get through this resistance zone, then I think it's a it at that point it's a lower risk um, situation to go along higher, which sounds weird, but again, I want to get through this traffic area first.</p>
</details>

> **Amit**: 你对年底有什么目标吗？你认为这会回到 200 美元吗，还是你觉得会有点困难？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> do you >> just getting spread around which is not not really bearish. Do you have a target for end of year? Could you see this back to 200 or you think that's going to be a little tough</p>
</details>

> **Jason**: 我可以很容易地看到它回到 200 美元以上，但技术分析是“如果这样，那么那样”。所以，如果它超过了这里的水平，也就是 184 美元左右，那么它就能走得更高。如果它能把当前的阻力位变成支撑位，那么毫无疑问，它会在短期内达到 195 美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> again? So I could easily see this back over 200, but TA is is if this then that, right? So if if it's over the levels are here. So this little area right here >> 187 roundabout. >> Yeah. And it's 184 very explicitly. So we can kind of see it. I'll just turn this red. So see this here. All of this selling selling. This is August and again here. And again here. And actually right here. It really it really kind of jumps out at you where you can start to see it. Oops. You can start to see like if I if I zoom in a little bit more. I don't want to take up too much time, but this is sorry July, late July, all of August. That's the orange box here. 184 spot 15. Uh I'll make this a little bit darker for you guys here. 184 spot 15. It's It's pretty apparent on the chart where this was. Is this a market cap level? At what market cap is this? >> Well, 123 is three trillion. I think it's guys, 4 trillion is one >> 4.5 maybe. >> Yeah, 4 trillion was 164. So, yeah. Yeah, 44 round about. >> I mean, sometimes it does this weird stuff, but um but there's a bit of a a explosion here and and this was support here. So it's it's very minuscule, but you can see where there's a lot of buying selling that happens right at that exact level. So I So if it can turn that current resistance, which is what this is, into support, meaning if it can get over it and hold above it and then you see something like that in this case, for sure like it's it's it's a no-brainer. This is definitively going in in short order, by the way. So, I just ran out of time to 195. 195 200 is a very specific round number.</p>
</details>

> **Amit**: 下一个，Meta。很多人都对它感到好奇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> uh guys, we're going to do all the main stocks, so about 10 15 of them, and then we will get into the audience requests. Uh next one, another big one a lot of people are curious about is Meta.</p>
</details>

> **Jason**: 它需要守住 634 美元的水平。到目前为止，它确实做到了。就像我们希望看到这个底部在这里形成一样，这很好。在这一点上，你的 20 天**简单移动平均线** (Simple Moving Average, SMA: 一种技术指标，通过计算特定时期内股价的算术平均值来平滑价格数据) 正在趋于平缓。如果 Meta 出现一点下跌，50 天线很可能会下穿 200 天线，形成**死亡交叉** (Death Cross: 技术分析中的一个术语，指短期移动平均线（通常是50日线）下穿长期移动平均线（通常是200日线），被视为空头信号)，那可能就是一个买入点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> No. So, so um so this this white line is Chris's trade. Shout out Chris wherever he is if he's in here. Is Chris here? I don't know. >> He's probably not, but he's probably happy that Meta is going higher. >> So, it what it needed to see is we needed to see it hold over that 634 level. And so far, it actually it it is um you know, just like we wanted to see this base get created over here. That's good. at this point where what's happening is that your your 20-day SMA is is um is leveling out, if you will. Um, you know, I made a a snarky comment the other day. I was like, when I when I get a death cross on Meta, it'll probably be a buy. If we get a a little bit of a blip down on Meta, that 50-day, which is the blue line here, is probably going to cross down below um what is this? is probably going to cross down below the 200 and and it'll be a death cross and it will probably be a buy.</p>
</details>

> **Jason**: 到目前为止，这看起来是建设性的。这是一个非常强劲的反弹。所以我认为我们更像是 K 型复苏，而不是直上直下的 V 型，但这里的轨迹是到 688.60 美元。只要我们守住 633 美元，你就会到那里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, if I get if I get that dip, I'll probably buy again. Uh and definitely if if it holds that 630ish level. Um but so far this looks constructive. Um this was a very like heavy bounce. So, I think we're looking more like the K style recovery than like the straight up V, but the trajectory here is to 68860. Uh, and and that that is what it is. So, 68860. As long as we hold 633, um, you're going there.</p>
</details>

> **Amit**: 特斯拉，你认为这只股票到年底有机会达到 460 美元吗？

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Great. And it's important we have moments like that throughout the segment because that stuff definitely is is helpful. Um Tessy, you think this one has a shot to get to 460 by end of year?</p>
</details>

> **Jason**: 哦天哪，她太努力了。她被困住了。这些移动平均线就像磁铁，它们不是动态的支撑和阻力。她被卡住了。我们有一个术语叫“移动平均线乒乓球”，你就在这些移动平均线之间来回弹。今天她把我给骗了，我得承认。我认为我对特斯拉的看法仍然成立，那就是她被困住了。这仍然是你的整个盘整区间。我认为她已经为那些喜欢卖出期权费的人做好了准备。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Oh my goodness, she's trying so hard, dude. She's trying. Um, so, um, again, what do we look for on these SMA? We look for them really tight and then when they're about to expand together, that's that's your cue. So, Tessy lines back on right back into resistance, she's trapped. So, if they're magnets, they're not dynamic support and resistance. We don't use them for that. Um, she's stuck. We use there's a term called like moving average ping pong. uh where you just like pingpong in between these these like whatever moving averages. That's literally ping pong ping pong ping pong in between these. Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom. Oh man, is she stuck. She got me today. I'm not going to lie. She got me. I was like, "All right, 50. We're coming down. We're going to breach this and she's going to come back in." Cuz 420, by the way, is is brought resistance up here, high traffic zone, right? And that's what I'm thinking. But it's a squeeze. We call squeeze area too. We're like if it gets over like this is heavy resistance. I don't think you're going to break through resistance. Not in the market at at the moment. There's no reason. No catalyst, no none of that. Um, so I should expect this to come down. And then it it just like boom gets sucked right back into the 50 and actually breaches it again. I'm like, oh my goodness. What was today's range? It was like 4:15 to 4:30 something. Dude, what a whipssaw day on Tessy. But she's trying. I think what I've been saying on Tesla holds true is that she's stuck. Uh, and that's the truth. So, so nothing has changed on Tesla the chart. Um, I think that this still remains to be your entire consolidation range. That could be I think she's primed for people that are into selling premium. I think this is a great spot for Tesla.</p>
</details>

> **Amit**: 谷歌，你认为到年底能守住 300 美元吗？因为我收到的很多问题是，要么突破到 350 美元，要么回撤到 290 美元区间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> um Google do you think this one can hold 300 till the end of the year >> because I think a lot of questions I'm getting on this one is there there's either breakout to 35 or there's a retrace back to the 290s.</p>
</details>

> **Jason**: 她太努力了。谷歌有点违背了很多常规。我实际上认为这还没有准备好上涨。我认为你这里有一个我们称之为“相当干净的低效率区”，市场想要填补，大约在 302 美元左右。回答你的问题，我认为它能守住 300 美元吗？是的。我认为它可能会有一次小幅下跌到 300 美元以下，然后被买入吗？很有可能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> She's trying so hard. I mean, you're on it, right? So, so when we were locked over here, first of all, Google has like kind of defied a lot of stuff in terms of general rule sets with with headlines, new headline, new headline, new headline. And it's it's it's been pretty stuck on that. around this area. I actually said Google was in premium generation mode similar to Tesla and like selling upside calls around like 320 310 area about 45 days to expiration would would technically be ideal because because at the time it had not broken out. It it tried to get over that that power that earnings gap and it did not. And then this day at 300 headline breaks, I'm thinking this is fine. Headline breaks and then poof, she goes, "Actually, I'm going to keep that stance and I still think that 320 310 cover call don't I'm not touching that." Um I I actually don't think this is ready to go. Uh, I think that you have this what we call like pretty clean inefficiency here that the market wants to fill around 302. To your question, do I think it holds 300? I do. Do I think that it can have a little dip into that sub 300 for for a blip that gets bought? Very possible.</p>

> **Jason**: 我们又回到了一个非常困难的水平。所以，我不想掉以轻心。我不想成为那个对正在发生的一切视而不见的人。我回到了 20 天 SMA 之上，但在 50 天线之下。我正在重新测试之前的破位下降趋势或上升趋势。所以，如果那是趋势线，那是我希望看到的。嗯，我正在从底部测试它，从下面，这很好。但还不够好。

<details>

<p class="english-text">But again, we've we've we're we are back on the mend, but look at this. We are right back to a very difficult level. So, I don't want to rest on my laurels. I don't want to be the guy that's like blind to everything that's happening here. Uh I am back over the 20-day SMA. I'm under the 50. I am retesting the prior broken downtrend or uptrend. So, if that was the trend line, that was what I wanted to see happen. Well, I'm testing it from from the bottom, from underneath, it's good. It's not quite good enough yet.</p>
</details>

> **Jason**: 127.86 美元，这是关键数字。如果这个坏小子能守住，那就是空头们生活的地方。我的意思是，他们就住在这里。他们在这里放弃。所以，现在，他们已经向我和我的同伴们开了几枪。你知道吗？好吧。他们赢得了一两场战斗，但看，我们带着复仇回来了。

<p class="english-text">That is my my biggest thing. So, here we are on this loss. Actually, let's just go from here. 12786. That's the number. 127.86. If this bad boy holds, that's where the bears are living. I mean, they're they're they're living right in here. And they give up right here. So, right now, they've taken a couple shots at me and my my cohorts. Uh, and you know what? Fine. They they've won a battle or two, but look, we came back with a vengeance.</p>

> **Amit**: AMD。

<p class="english-text">>> Uh, all right, we got four more main ones, then we'll get into audience ones. Uh, AMD,</p>
</details>

> **Jason**: 它没有完全达到 185 美元，但很接近了。它进入了那个区域。这个灰色区域就是那个区域。这个家伙，实际上是头肩顶形态，已经完成了。这意味着如果这是头，这是肩，那么目标已经达到。所以那个形态完成了。你真的不用再担心那个了。最坏的情况是 182 美元。

<details>

<p class="english-text">AMD didn't quite get to 185. Oo, she got close, though, huh? >> Got very close. >> Real close. She got into the box. And so, so this this gray box was the box. This guy right here that is actually the head and shoulders pattern whatever completed meaning if this is the head and the shoulders it's that um 50% 50% of that extended that's target acquired. So that pattern complete. You don't really have to worry about that anymore unless it um and worst case it the worst case it was 182 which at 190 I guess you really don't worry about it.</p>
</details>

> **Jason**: 227 美元曾经是，现在仍然是关键的转折点。你真的希望它能超过那个点。仍然有很大的可能性它会达到 185 美元。所以我仍然在观察。我仍然会更放心。这被称为熊旗，不是一个看涨的设置。实际上是一个相当看跌的设置。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You just kind of close your eyes and buy a little double bottom amidst amidst uh what is that? There it is. Double bottom. Um but 227 is well shoot is was and remains the like the critical like pivot and power shift pivot. Um we'll just zoom out just so you guys see it. So 227 is from here. That's 2024 all-time high. So it it really you'd really want it to be over that. Um there's still a real like there's still a real possibility that this gets to 185s. Um so it's still on watch. I would I would still be more comfortable. Um this is what you would call a bare flag. It's not a bullish setup. It's actually pretty bearish setup here.</p>

> **Amit**: SoFi。

<p class="english-text">>> Yep. Um all right last couple uh SoFi</p>

> **Jason**: 看起来好多了。28.75 美元是个大关口。守住这个水平，这里曾是阻力位，这里、这里、这里，对吧？这里曾经是支撑位，这里是阻力位，最近是支撑位。所以，曾经的阻力位，已经变成了近期的支撑位。

Like you can like tickle him. >> That was the thing you've actually That's gonna get clipped, bro. That is >> um I It actually looks good. So, this is doing what I was hoping that some others would do. So, it's actually whole thing. >> Dude, we have a >> none of your other guests are this. None of your other guests would do that. >> That's true. They wouldn't. >> Um, >> that's that's why you're special. So, >> all right. So, this 20 2875 big deal um to hold this level was resistance right here, here, here, right? um had been support for a time in here, resistance here, support recently. So what was resistance, sorry, has turned near-term</p>
</details>

> **Jason**: 我认为这会再进行一次盘整。不需要急于下注，但当它确实超过时，这将非常依赖于利率。我们很可能已经消化了，所以不是实际的降息，而是关于未来降息速度的言论，更重要的是，下一任美联储主席是谁。这里有一个流动性很低的区域需要填补，直到 32 美元。

<p class="english-text">dude. I mean people that don't like technicals or thought it was just astrology. I I swear like if there was a TT like chat like they could just like this is how much I made just by like low 24s dip by kabam. I mean that's money TT pays again here we are right up in here actually holding this I think this does another consolidation don't need to press the bet but when it does get over um which it's really going to try this is this is very much going to come down to rates uh and we're we're very likely priced in so not actual rate cuts but rhetoric around the the velocity of rate cuts to come more notably who the next Fed chair will be as well. Heavy heavy low like low liquidity zone here to fill into the 32s</p>

### 加密货币市场分析

> **Amit**: 好的，今天最后一个。比特币。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I love it. Last one for the day. Bitcoin</p>
</details>

> **Jason**: 我确实说过要等 70,000 美元。我不知道我是否能等到 70,000 美元。但很多这些东西，加密货币的反弹实际上已经稳住了。我曾一度有点担心，但以太坊的 2,700 美元和比特币的 8,400 美元实际上是一个大事。守住是一个相当大的事。所以这里非常具有建设性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, I I I I did say wait for 70s. Um I don't know if I if I get 70s. Um but a lot of these things. So, the crypto bounce has actually held. I was worried there for a little bit, but 2,700 on Ethereum and this 8,400 on Bitcoin actually a big deal. Um quite a quite a big deal to to hold. So very constructive here. Um</p>
</details>

> **Jason**: 如果它能超过 90,000 美元，它就会进入 95,000 美元的区域。所以它必须超过这个。从这里开始，几周前我们谈论过什么是熊市到牛市的反转。第一步，20 天 SMA。那是第一步，就是这条白线。我们正在越过它。所以我认为你可以在这附近盘整。然后你到达 50 天线，那会让你正好在 95,000 美元的区域。第二步是超过它，然后你就会进入 106,000 美元。所以是 100,000 美元吗？不是。是 106,000 美元左右吗？是的。是 12 月吗？可能是 1 月。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">this is that most recent base. Is it over? I think this has a lot to do with that that yen carry trade. Um, it's building a base if this gets over 90s like or not 90s like this is going to head into that 95 area right there. So, it's got to get over this. And so, from here, remember uh a couple weeks back we were talking about what is a what is a a bearish to bullish reversal look like? Step one. Step one, 20-day SMA. That's step one. That's this white line. And we're kind of coming over. So, I think you could chop around this. And then you get to the 50-day. That's going to land you right at that at that at that 95 area. Step two is to get over that and you're going to traverse into 106. So, is it 100? No. Is it 106 or so? Yes. Uh, is it December? It's probably January. How's that?</p>
</details>

> **Amit**: 好的，这就是我们今天的所有内容。这是 Jason 的推特，在聊天里。我明天早上会回来。我同意你说的很多关于市场状况的看法。感觉我们正在为年底的上涨趋势做准备，但它就像在走钢丝，因为我们刚刚经历了所有的下跌。所以我想我们所有人都在想，我们真的相信投入新的多头资金在这里是一个好的风险回报吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, that's all we got. There's Jason's Twitter in the chat. We'll be back or I'll be back tomorrow morning. Um, yeah, it it I I agree with a lot of what you said around the market conditions. Like it feels like we're setting up for an uptrend towards the end of the year, but it's it's like it's towing the line because we're we just came through all the red. So, I think all of us are just like, you know, do we really trust net new long money is a good risk board here?</p>
</details>

> **Jason**: 是的，这是一个很好的说法。新的多头资金，在这里是高风险的新多头资金。我卖东西吗？不。是的，但你知道，最好等一下，看看我们是否能清除一些障碍。然后我可以说，“哦，我们没事了。” 然后很高兴。另外，我不想毁了圣诞节，因为嘿，从低点以来，这是一次地狱般的反弹，伙计。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, that's a good it's a good way to say it. Like new money long, it's high risk new money long here. Do I sell stuff? No. Right. Yeah, >> but you know, it's better to wait a little bit to see if we can clear some hurdles. Um, and then I can I can say, "Oh, we're we're good." Um, and and be happy. Plus, I don't want to ruin Christmas cuz hey, this has been a hell of a rally from the lows, man. I mean, do you guys remember,</p>
