title: AI商业转型失败的五大案例及其深刻教训
---

### 引言：AI转型中的现实挑战

一位顾客抓了五个番茄就走了。当摄像头识别错误时，谁知道他们付了多少钱？一辆行驶中的卡车里正在烤披萨。谁能阻止奶酪滑落？一部重制版的《乱世佳人》上线流媒体。当人物面部看起来不对劲时，谁来批准它上线？自动化只有在背后有大量人工支持时才能良好运作。今天的故事是关于五次失败的**AI转型**（AI Pivots: 指企业将核心业务或产品策略转向人工智能驱动的尝试），这些产品押注遭遇了物理定律、市场现实和利润率的严峻挑战。我们将研究五个**单位经济效益**（Unit Economics: 指每单位产品或服务所产生的收入和成本）崩溃导致产品失败的重大案例，并从中吸取教训。让我们深入探讨。

<p class="english-text">A shopper grabs five tomatoes and walks out. Who knows how much they paid when the cameras guess wrong? A pizza bakes in a moving truck. Who stops the cheese from sliding? A remastered Gone with the Wind hits streaming. Who approves it when the faces look off? Automation works well when there is an army of people behind it. Today's story is about five failed AI pivots where product bets were hit with physics, market reality, and margins. We will study five big cases where the unit economics snapped and the product failed and figure out what we can learn from them. Let's dive in.</p>
</details>

### 案例一：亚马逊的Just Walk Out——无收银购物的困境

亚马逊的**Just Walk Out**（即拿即走）项目原本旨在打造一个在杂货店和便利店无需结账的购物体验。其理念是让顾客进入商店，拿起商品，然后直接离开，无需扫描任何商品或在收银台付款。该项目于2018年启动，随后在Amazon Go和Amazon Fresh商店推广。其目标是创造一种新时代的无摩擦购物体验。Just Walk Out项目是零售自动化领域大规模投资AI的第一个案例，然而，亚马逊最终在2024年从其商店中撤下了该系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amazon's just walk out was supposed to be a checkout free project at grocery and convenience stores. The idea was to let customers enter a store, pick up the items, and leave without scanning anything or stopping to pay at the till. The project launched in 2018, and later on they rolled it out in Amazon Go and Amazon Fresh stores. The idea was to create a new age frictionless shopping experience. The Just Walk Out project was the first example of a massive investment in AI retail automation, but nevertheless, the company retired the system from its stores in 2024.</p>
</details>

让我们来了解一下原因。据报道，亚马逊在2019年至2020年间每年在Just Walk Out项目上花费约100万美元。这笔投资涵盖了所有的研发和资本支出。那么，这笔钱是多还是少呢？在大型超市实施该系统，每家店需要花费1000万到1500万美元，这远远高于传统的结账系统。在自动化系统的背后，亚马逊在印度雇佣了1000多人实时标记视频。这一人工层确保了准确性，但也吞噬了利润。数据处理和错误修正的成本超过了正常的零售运营，尤其是在产品种类复杂的**大卖场**（Big Box Stores: 指销售大量商品、面积巨大的零售商店）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's understand why. Amazon reportedly spend around $1 million annually on Just Walkout between 2019 and 2020. This investment covered all R&D and capital expenses. Now, how much is it? a billion dollars. Is it a lot or is it a little? The implementation of this system in large supermarkets required from 10 to 15 million per store, which is far above traditional checkout systems. Behind the automation curtain, Amazon hired more than 1,000 people in India labeling videos in real time. That human layer kept things accurate, but it also destroyed the margins. The cost of processing data and fixing mistakes outpaced a normal retail operation, especially in big box stores with complex product mixes.</p>
</details>

在像Amazon Go或Amazon Fresh这样的便利店实施这种系统要容易得多。原因在于这些商店的产品种类和可能的组合都相当有限。然而，如果你考虑像沃尔玛这样的商店，你可能会买几个需要称重的番茄，一盒需要扫描的番茄，或许还有一张如果你在本周末购买烤面包机就能打七五折的枕头。当你处理这种复杂的产品组合时（这只是一个微小的例子），亚马逊的Just Walk Out系统就会产生大量错误，这也是它在大商店推广时遇到困难的原因。据估计，高达70%的交易需要人工干预。通过取消收银员所期望节省的劳动力成本，被大量的场外人工操作所抵消。如果你仔细想想，需要人工在背后支持，这从一开始就违背了自动化的初衷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is a lot easier to implement a system like this at a convenience store like Amazon Go or Amazon Fresh. And the reason for that is because the product mix and the possible combination of products at those stores are quite limited. Now, if you think about a store like Walmart, for example, you can get a few tomatoes that need to be weighted. You can get a box of tomatoes that needs to be scanned and perhaps a pillow that is 25% off if you get a toaster by the end of the week. When you work with a product mix like that, and that's just a tiny example, Amazon's just walk out starts to produce a lot of errors, which is why they struggled with the adoption among the large stores. It was estimated that up to 70% of transactions required human intervention. The labor cost savings expected from removing cashiers were wiped out by the substantial off-site human operation. And if you think about it, the need to have the humans behind it really defeats the purpose of automation in the first place.</p>
</details>

该项目还需要大量的硬件，包括数千个摄像头、货架传感器、用于计算机视觉和AI的后端基础设施，所有这些都导致了高昂的设置和维护成本。在这种商业模式下，商店需要大幅增加销售额才能抵消资本和运营支出。而这正是亚马逊从未达到的门槛。最终结果是，亚马逊继续在较小的Amazon Go商店中使用该项目，但已放弃了在杂货店的应用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The project also required lots of hardware, thousands of cameras, shelf sensors, a backend infrastructure for computer vision and AI, all of which resulted in high setup and maintenance costs. In this business model, stores would have needed to dramatically increase sales to offset capital and operational expenses. And that was the threshold that Amazon never met. The end result, Amazon continues using this project and smaller Amazon Go stores, but they have abandoned the grocery store application.</p>

### AI会议助手：Radiant的创新

你知道每次会议都是以同样的方式结束的：十个人点头，三个人做笔记，但只有一个人记得会议的决定。如果你幸运的话，你可能会说：“但会议记录下来了。”当然，如果你为这些录音付费，即使你付了钱，之后又会发生什么呢？你得到了一堆文本，仍然需要处理，比如创建行动项、更新工单、起草后续邮件或清理混乱。这就是我们与**Radiant**合作的原因，因为在一个你为每个应用程序付费的世界里，最明智的做法是为一款能替代五个应用程序的产品付费。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know how every meeting ends in the same way. 10 people nod, three people take notes, and only one remembers what got decided. If you're lucky, you might say, "But costs get recorded." Now, sure, if you're paying for those recordings, and even if you do, what happens after? You've got a pile of text that you still need to do something with, creating action items, updating tickets, drafting follow-ups, or cleaning up the chaos. And this is why we partnered with Radiant, because in a world where you're paying for every single app, the smartest move is to pay for one that replaces five.</p>
</details>

Radiant在测试阶段完全免费，所以你根本不需要支付任何费用。我个人喜欢跨多个平台工作的工具。它更简洁，能让你物有所值，而且你不需要记住哪个应用程序处理什么。Radiant是一款AI会议助手，可以捕捉你的通话，将其转换为笔记，然后将这些笔记转化为已完成的行动：Slack消息、项目更新、待办工单、起草的文档，甚至原型。它支持Zoom、Teams、Google Meet、Notion、Cursor、Lovable、Asana、ClickUp等众多平台。所以你的后续工作会准确地出现在你已经工作的环境中。

<details>

### 案例二：IBM的Watson Health——AI医疗营销的泡沫

接下来是IBM的**Watson Health**（沃森健康）。IBM的Watson Health或许是企业史上最昂贵的AI转型失败案例，在十年间烧掉了40亿到50亿美元现金。最终，它以投资金额的一小部分被出售。IBM的案例表明了AI营销如何超越技术现实。IBM的失败根源在于极高的运营成本、严重缺陷的单位经济效益，以及AI承诺与实际医疗成果之间的巨大鸿沟。IBM将其产品Watson定位为一项革命性的癌症诊断技术。他们还与**MD Anderson癌症中心**（MD Anderson Cancer Center: 位于美国德克萨斯州休斯顿，是世界顶级的癌症治疗和研究机构之一）合作。如果你不熟悉癌症护理领域，MD Anderson是一个非常重要的机构。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moving on to IBM's Watson Health. IBM's Watson Health is perhaps the most expensive AI pivot failure in corporate history. The one that has burned through four to five billion dollars in cash over a decade. And in the end, it ended up being sold for a fraction of the money that was invested. IBM is an example of how AI marketing can outpace technological reality. IBM's failure is rooted in extremely high operational costs, deeply flawed unit economics, and glaring gaps between AI promise and practical medical results. IBM positioned its product Watson as a revolutionary cancer diagnosis technology. They also partnered with MD Anderson Cancer Center. Now, if you aren't familiar with the world of cancer care, MD Anderson is a pretty big deal.</p>
</details>

他们的承诺雄心勃勃：AI能够分析海量的医学文献和患者数据，从而推荐个性化和定制化的癌症治疗方案。再来看看单位经济效益和成本。IBM估计在医疗保健收购上花费了50亿美元。这样做的目标是为了用数据喂养Watson的AI引擎。在其鼎盛时期，Watson Health雇佣了7000多名具有各种医学和科学专业背景的人员，这意味着在薪资、技术团队和支持人员方面产生了巨大的固定成本。据报道，Watson每处理一个肿瘤诊断或支持案例的成本远高于常规水平。在消费者端（这里的消费者是医院），该产品最终购买和维护成本非常高，没有明确的投资回报率（ROI），最重要的是，没有经过验证的临床效益。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The promise was ambitious. AI that could analyze vast amounts of medical literature and patient data to recommend personalized and tailored cancer care. Onto the unit economics and costs. IBM spent an estimated $5 billion on healthcare acquisitions. And that was done with a goal to feed Watson's AI engine with data. At its peak, Watson Health employed more than 7,000 people of various medical and scientific specialties, which meant a massive fixed cost spent in salaries, technical teams, and support staff. Watson's cost per one oncology diagnosis or support case was reportedly much higher than usual. And on the consumer side, consumer being a hospital, the product ended up being very expensive to purchase and maintain with no clear ROI and most importantly no proven clinical benefit.</p>
</details>

仅MD Anderson癌症护理合作项目就耗费了6200万美元，却未能产出可部署的产品。Watson Health在医院的实施通常每份合同花费数百万美元，但还需要额外的预算用于持续支持、定制化以及与**电子健康记录**（Electronic Health Records, EHR: 医院用于存储患者健康信息的数字化系统）的整合，而电子健康记录是任何医院的支柱。大多数医院的部署都需要定制配置，因为Watson难以处理非结构化的患者数据。系统成本增长速度快于收入。IBM从未将Watson Health扩展到盈利。他们最好的财务表现是在削减工作岗位并最终以约10亿美元出售该部门时实现了收支平衡，这意味着损失了约80%的投资。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The MD Anderson Cancer Care Partnership alone consumed $62 million without producing a deployable product. Watson Health's implementation at hospitals was often in the millions per contract but required additional budget for ongoing support customization and integration with electronic health records and electronic health records is the backbone of any hospital. Most hospital deployments required custom configuration because Watson struggled with unstructured patient data. System costs grew faster than revenues. IBM never scaled Watson Health to profitability. Their peak financial performance was when they broke even by slashing jobs and eventually selling the unit for about $1 billion, which is the loss of about 80% of investment.</p>
</details>

那么它为什么会失败呢？Watson Health是AI预期与医疗实践现实之间根本性错位的例子。IBM的营销承诺了革命性的突破，但技术却无法实现。他们没有考虑到现实世界中混乱的患者记录和医生笔记中丰富的上下文信息。Watson只能分析结构良好的数据，而这在大多数医院数据库中只占少数。医生作为Watson的最终用户，发现它难以使用，并且通常更喜欢自己的专业知识。所有这些导致了许多部署在经历了数月的复杂界面和最重要的是不可靠的推荐系统带来的挫败感后被放弃。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So why did it fail? What's in health is an example of a fundamental misalignment between AI expectations and the reality of a medical practice. IBM's marketing promised revolutionary breakthroughs the technology couldn't deliver. They did not account for realworld messy patient records and contextrich doctor's notes. Watson could only analyze well ststructured data. A minority at most hospital databases. Doctors, the ultimate users of Watson, found it hard to use and often preferred their own expertise. All of this resulted in many abandoned deployments after months of frustration with complicated interfaces and most importantly unreliable recommendation system.</p>
</details>

除此之外，产品未能解决隐私问题和多方面的医疗保健法律。与此同时，Oracle和Microsoft利用IBM被Watson的复杂性和问题分散注意力的事实，决定进行大规模且重点突出的收购，从而产生了明确的企业价值。最终结果是，到2021年，Watson Health变得无利可图，这促使IBM将其出售。总而言之，Watson Health的巨大亏损是由于对AI不切实际的期望、未经审查的支出、高接触的实施，以及AI从未与其营销宣传和临床医学需求相匹配的结果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And on top of that, privacy concerns and multiaceted healthcare laws were not addressed by the product. In the meantime, Oracle and Microsoft took advantage of the fact that IBM was distracted by Watson's complexity and issues and decided to make large and focused acquisitions that yielded clear enterprise value. End result, by 2021, Watson Health became unprofitable, which prompted IBM to sell it. All in all, what's in health enormous losses were a result of unrealistic expectations from AI, unchecked spending, hight touch implementations, and AI that never matched its marketing narrative, and the needs of clinical medicine.</p>
</details>

### 案例三：Netflix的AI内容升级——品牌信任的代价

接下来是Netflix的AI内容升级。2025年初，Netflix大力推动使用AI进行内容增强和升级，这引起了广泛关注和多重争议，尤其是在经典节目的拙劣修复方面。客户的强烈反弹非常激烈，除此之外，他们对AI的使用引发了关于人工智能在媒体中，特别是媒体保存、内容质量和真实性方面的作用的更广泛质疑。Netflix是围绕AI引发公关危机的典型例子。让我们看看发生了什么。Netflix使用AI升级技术将旧的、低分辨率的电视节目转换为高清，其中最著名的是《A Different World》。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moving on to Netflix, AI content upscaling. In early 2025, Netflix pushed to use AI for content enhancement and upscaling, which draw a lot of attention and multiple controversies, especially around the mangled restoration of classic shows. Customer backlash has been intense and on top of this, their use of AI triggered broader questions raised about the role of artificial intelligence in media and specifically in media preservation, content quality, and authenticity. Netflix is a prime example of PR crisis around AI. Let's look at what happened. Netflix used AI upscaling to convert older, lower resolution television shows to high definition, notably A different world.</p>
</details>

他们绕过了传统的**人工重制**（Manual Remastering: 指通过人工方式对电影或音乐的原始素材进行修复和优化，以提高其质量和清晰度），这种重制需要原始胶片底片和细致的人工修复工作。此举的目标是快速、经济高效地修复旧电影。但事实证明，AI在处理颗粒状的原始素材时遇到了很大困难。它产生了许多扭曲的视觉效果、模糊的面孔、过度平滑的纹理，以及极其扭曲和不真实的背景。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What they did is that they bypassed traditional manual remastering that requires original film negatives and detailed human restoration work. The goal behind this move was rapid, cost-effective restoration of old film. But as it turned out, AI really struggled with grainy source materials. It produced lots of distorted visuals, blurred faces, overly smooth textures, and extremely distorted and unrealistic backgrounds.</p>
</details>

Netflix还面临着巨大的反弹，因为粉丝们发现《Arcane》第二季的宣传海报是AI生成的。这些海报包含了人工智能生成的明显迹象，包括扭曲的解剖结构和不自然的细节。这场争议触及了600万观众，并迫使Netflix撤下相关内容。在Netflix的案例中，与亚马逊的Just Walk Out或IBM的Watson不同，这更多是关于损害客户信任和品牌认知，而不是收入损失或资金烧毁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Netflix also faced massive backlash when fans discovered AI generated promotional posters for Arcane season 2. Those posters included telltale signs of artificial generation included distorted anatomy and unnatural details. The controversy reached 6 million viewers and forced Netflix to remove the content. In Netflix's case, unlike Amazon Just Walk Out or IBM Watson, it's less about lost revenue or burned cash and a lot more about damaged customer trust and brand perception.</p>
</details>

让我们来看看这一举动的单位经济效益。如果我们设身处地为Netflix着想，从商业角度来看，尝试使用AI进行内容升级是有道理的，因为人工重制非常昂贵且缓慢。如果其中一部分可以通过模型修复，从而可以将最精细的工作委托给经验丰富的专业人员，那为什么不这样做呢？AI升级可以以最小的劳动力大规模处理大型内容库。Netflix在用于视频修复的机器学习方面投入巨资，主要目标是降低每个标题的成本。但在我看来，这是需要按**瀑布式序列**（Waterfall Sequence: 指一种线性的、顺序的项目管理方法，每个阶段必须在前一个阶段完成后才能开始）完成的事情。它只有在做得好的时候才有效，因为一旦失败，品牌损害和客户不满会使那些节省的成本十倍地抵消。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's go through the unit economics of this move. If we put ourselves in the shoes of Netflix and look at it from the business perspective, it makes sense to try AI and use it for content upscaling because manual remastering is very expensive and slow. And if there is a part of it that can be restored by a model so you can delegate the most delicate work to an experienced professional, why not do it? AI upscaling can process large libraries at scale with minimum labor. Netflix invested heavily in machine learning for video restoration and the key goal was to reduce the per title cost. But in my opinion, it's one of those things that need to be done in a waterfall sequence. It only works when it's done well because when it fails, the brand damage and customer dissatisfaction offset those savings 10fold.</p>
</details>

那么它为什么会失败呢？Netflix部署的模型无法忠实地再现原始素材的艺术意图、色彩或微妙细节。它非但没有增强怀旧感（这实际上是一种非常流行的趋势，尤其是在Z世代中，他们追求不拘一格、反完美的审美），反而疏远了长期粉丝。另一个奇怪的地方是，升级内容的关键缺陷，如乱码文本、截断场景、模糊面孔，都通过了Netflix的质量检查。这反过来表明对算法解决方案的过度依赖，以及对人工监督的绝对需求。AI不仅用于升级，还用于操纵演员的嘴部动作和配音电影，这又引发了关于艺术完整性和表演者权利的更广泛的伦理担忧。这并非Netflix首次因原创纪录片和营销中的AI生成视觉效果而面临反弹，但他们未能充分解决这些问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So why did it fail? The models that Netflix deployed couldn't faithfully recreate the artistic intent, colors, or subtle details of the original footage. Instead of enhancing nostalgia, that is actually very much a trend, especially among Gen Z, with non-conforming anti-perfect aesthetics, it alienated longtime fans. Another curious thing is that the critical flaws with the upscaled content like garble text, cut off scenes, blurred faces, all of them pass Netflix's quality checks. And that in turn signals extreme over reliance on algorithmic solutions and the absolute need for human oversight. AI was used not just in upscaling but also to manipulate actors mouth movements and dubbed films which in turn raised broader ethical concerns over artistic integrity and performer rights. This was not the first time when Netflix faced backlash for AI generated visuals in original documentaries and marketing which they did not adequately address.</p>
</details>

总而言之，对我来说，这更多是一次公关失败，甚至超过了技术失败。当然，技术上也有问题，但主要是公关问题。整个事件引发了业界对创意媒体中自动化极限的广泛讨论。所以，这不仅仅是Netflix的问题，这意味着整个事件对整个行业都产生了影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All in all, to me, this is a PR failure, even more so than the technical. Technical, too, for sure, but mostly PR. This entire situation has triggered industry-wide debate on the limits of automation in creative media. So, this is a lot more than just Netflix, meaning this whole situation had an industry-wide impact.</p>
</details>

### 案例四：Zoom Pizza——被物理定律打败的创新

接下来是**Zoom Pizza**。Zoom Pizza是一家雄心勃勃的由软银支持的初创公司，其目标是彻底改变披萨配送。他们的愿景是在卡车内烹饪披萨，并比任何其他传统披萨连锁店更快地将它们送到顾客家中。卡车里装满了数十个联网烤箱。订单通过应用程序下达。配料和浇头由机器人组装，尽管一些人工工人也做了一些准备工作。披萨在送达前才烹饪。目标是最大限度的保鲜和效率。但有一个非常简单的问题几乎扼杀了这项业务：披萨在卡车移动和烹饪过程中，奶酪会不断滑落。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moving on to Zoom Pizza. Zoom Pizza was an ambitious softbankbacked startup whose ambition was to revolutionize pizza delivery. Their vision was to cook pizzas inside trucks and deliver them to customers homes much faster than any other traditional pizza chain. Trucks were filled with dozens of internet connected ovens. Orders were placed through the app. Ingredients and toppings were robotically assembled, although some human workers did some prep. And pizzas were cooked just before delivery arrival. The goal was maximum freshness and efficiency. But there was one painfully simple problem that sort of killed the business. Cheese kept sliding off pizzas while they were cooked and moving trucks.</p>
</details>

如果你认为这听起来不是什么大问题，为什么仅仅因为奶酪问题就关闭整个业务呢？我想说，从表面上看，这确实听起来是个好主意。我理解他们为什么能获得资金，但我想邀请你和我一起玩**产品管理101**（Product Management 101: 指产品管理的基础知识和入门概念），真正理解这个问题。但在我们深入探讨之前，先来看看单位经济效益和成本细分。Zoom的整个自动化押注是基于惊人的资本和运营成本，而披萨行业以利润率极低而闻名。他们从软银筹集了4.45亿美元，但没有进行尽职调查来计算运营成本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you're thinking that it doesn't sound like a big problem, why close the entire business because of the cheese? I'd like to argue and say that on the surface it actually does sound like a good idea. I understand why they got funding, but I would like to invite you to play product management 101 with me and really understand the problem. But before we go there, unit economics and cost breakdown. Zoom's entire automation bet was based on staggering capital and operational costs in an industry known for very tight margins. They raised $445 million from Soft Bank, but they did not do a due diligence calculating operational costs.</p>
</details>

Zoom有一个根本性的缺陷。尽管获得了数亿美元的资金和工程师团队，Zoom却忘记了在移动车辆中烹饪披萨的物理原理。当业务开始运营时，奶酪就是会滑落。他们有工程师团队在多年的研发后试图解决奶酪问题。但整个运营基本上被简单的物理原理和机器人无法克服的现实世界条件所击败。Zoom的卡车设计和建造花费了数百万美元，每辆卡车装有56个迷你烤箱，并配备了高度先进的GPS驱动调度系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Zoom had one fundamental flaw. Despite hundreds of millions in funding and teams of engineers, Zoom forgot about the physics of cooking pizza and moving vehicles. And when the business began operating, the cheese was simply sliding off. They had teams of engineers trying to solve the cheese problem after years of R&D. But the entire operation got essentially defeated by simple physics and realworld conditions that robots could not overcome. Zoom's trucks cost millions to design and build. with each truck fitting 56 mini ovens and was supplied with highly advanced GPS-driven scheduling.</p>
</details>

我没有找到很多关于其隔热部分的资料。但你能想象一辆装满燃气、里面有56个正在工作的烤箱的卡车吗？配料成本约为每份披萨6美元，售价定为每份披萨18美元或更高。在我看来，这个价格实际上相当有竞争力。是的，它不便宜，但这是餐厅品质披萨的典型价格。软银在2018年投资了3.75亿美元，并根据成为“披萨界的亚马逊”的愿景，将Zoom估值为22.5亿美元。他们将Zoom视为其战略投资组合的一部分，与Uber等食品配送公司并列。Zoom还有其他投资者，但最大的一笔资金来自软银。对软银来说，这项投资完全失败了，因为Zoom在2023年关闭。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, I haven't found a lot of data on the whole thermo isolation piece of it. But can you imagine having a truck full of gas with 56 working ovens inside of it? Ingredient costs were around $6 per pizza and the selling price was set at $18 or more per pizza. Now, the price, in my opinion, is actually quite competitive. Yeah, it's not cheap, but it is a typical price of a restaurant quality pizza. Soft Bank invested $375 million in 2018 and valued Zoom at $2.25 billion based on visions of becoming the Amazon of pizzas. They saw Zoom as part of their strategic portfolio alongside food delivery companies like Uber. Now, Zoom had other investors as well, but the largest sum came from SoftBank. For Soft Bank, the investment became a complete loss because Zoom shut down in 2023.</p>
</details>

他们试图在2020年进行转型。他们完全放弃了披萨配送服务，转而利用他们已经购买的机器人制造可持续包装。投资者的压力，特别是来自软银的压力，导致他们过早地扩张，并积极转型到不相关的包装和物流行业，这使得他们不断烧钱，却看不到任何**产品市场契合度**（Product Market Fit: 指产品能够满足市场需求，并被目标客户群体广泛接受的状态）。最终结果是，Zoom的失败表明了基本的物理原理如何能够击败各种复杂的AI和机器人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They tried to make a pivot by 2020. They abandoned the pizza delivery service as a whole and pivoted to sustainable packaging manufacturing using the very robots that they already paid for. Investor pressure, especially from Soft Bank, led them to scale prematurely and make an aggressive pivot into unrelated packaging and logistics industry, which kept burning cash without any sight of product market fit. End result, Zoom's failure demonstrates how fundamental physics can defeat all kinds of sophisticated AI and robots.</p>

现在，让我们回到产品管理101，并意识到他们围绕一个并不真正存在的问题创建了一项业务。在为这个视频做研究时，我发现了一个很棒的、非常小众的YouTube频道，它专门讨论如何开办和运营披萨业务，他们作为披萨业务专家解释了这个问题。事实是，我们所知的披萨配送服务运作良好。它不完美，但足够好。没有足够的证据表明Zoom试图解决的服务存在差距。Zoom专注于技术而非基本产品质量，创造了一个无法扩展的商业模式。他们在没有在初始市场验证其商业模式和产品的情况下，就进行了激进的扩张。坦率地说，我非常惊讶这个问题在最初的测试中没有出现。但如果最初的测试从未发生过，那就能回答我的问题了。

<p class="english-text">Now, let's come back to Product Management 101 for a second and realize that they created a business around a problem that didn't really exist. When doing research for this video, I found this awesome, very niche YouTube channel that talks about how to start and operate pizza businesses and they explain this very problem as people who specialize in pizza business. The thing is, pizza delivery service as we know it works fine. It's not ideal, but it's good enough. And there isn't enough evidence for a service gap that Zoom set out to fix. Zoom's focus on technology over basic product quality created an unscalable business model. They went into aggressive expansion without validating their business model and product in initial markets. I'm frankly extremely surprised how this problem did not come up in initial testing. But if the initial testing never happened, then that would answer my question.</p>

### 案例五：Quibi——短视频流媒体的速朽

最后是**Quibi**，这个耗资17.5亿美元的短视频流媒体灾难。Quibi是2020年代初的一个短视频流媒体平台。他们在2020年4月推出前从投资者那里筹集了大约17.5亿美元，并于2020年12月关闭。这家公司只存活了6个月。Quibi可能是最快、最昂贵的内容平台失败案例。其核心主题是他们未能理解人们如何消费移动内容。考虑到所获得的资金，这绝对是我们今天讨论的所有公司中最快的失败。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And lastly, Quibby, the 1.75 billion short form streaming disaster. Quibby was a short form video streaming platform in early 2020s. They raised approximately $1.75 billion from investors before launching in April 2020 and shutting down in December 2020. The company was alive for 6 months. Quibby is probably the fastest and the most expensive content platform failure. And the core theme here is that they failed to understand how people consume mobile content. This is definitely the fastest failure given the funding of all the companies that we covered today.</p>
</details>

让我们了解一下原因。Quibi通过多轮融资和多位投资者筹集了资金。他们得到了顶级好莱坞制片厂的支持，包括NBC、索尼、华纳兄弟、狮门影业、米高梅，以及阿里巴巴等科技公司，还有高盛和摩根大通等投资者。该公司在内容制作上挥霍无度。原创剧本节目的预算高达每分钟10万美元。他们制作了各种原创短视频内容，重点放在高价值制作和好莱坞大牌人才上。考虑到他们只在市场上存在了六个月，他们已经制作了不少节目。Quibi在内容上投入巨资，宣布计划在其运营的第一年投入超过11亿美元用于原创节目。著名的电影制作人和明星纷纷签约，许多节目的制作预算巨大，与高端有线电视甚至Netflix原创节目不相上下。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Let's understand why. Quibby raised funds through multiple rounds and multiple investors. They were backed by top tier Hollywood studios. NBC, Sony, Warner Brothers, Lionsgate, MGM, tech firms like Alibaba, and investors like Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. The company spent lavishly on content production. Budgets reached up to $100,000 per minute for original scripted shows. They produced a wide range of original short form content with a heavy focus on high value production and big Hollywood talent. Given that they were on the market for six months, they've got quite a few shows under their belt. Quibby invested heavily in content, announcing plans to spend over $1.1 billion on original programming during its first year of operation. prestigious filmmakers and stars signed on, and many shows had massive production budgets, very much comparable to high-end cable TV and even Netflix originals.</p>
</details>

在短短6个月的运营中，广告支出达到了6300万美元。但尽管如此，Quibi的订阅和广告收入仅为700万美元，广告商因观看量低而开始推迟付款。那么，我们来谈谈哪里出了问题。Quibi最大的问题是他们真正误解了市场。Quibi的高管们认为人们需要高质量的短视频内容用于通勤，但他们却在2020年推出，当时通勤已经消失了。这项服务对用户可以在TikTok或YouTube上免费获得的内容收取5到7美元的费用。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Advertising spending reached $63 million in just 6 months of operations. But despite all of that, Quibby's revenue from subscriptions and ads was $7 million, and advertiser payments started being deferred due to low viewership. So, let's talk about what went wrong. The biggest theme with Quibby is that they really misunderstood the market. Quibby's executives believe that people wanted high quality short form content for commuting, but they launched in 2020 when commuting disappeared. The service charged from $5 to 7 for content that users could get free on Tik Tok or YouTube.</p>
</details>

另一个问题是制作成本。尽管在好莱坞人才内容上花费了超过10亿美元，Quibi却未能制作出任何爆款。作为最近才进入内容创作领域的人，我真诚地认为，在你开始感受到内容市场契合度之前，大规模投资制作是没有意义的。需要明确的是，我并不是将自己与拥有大量好莱坞投资者的媒体公司进行比较。它们的规模完全相反。但无论如何，这都是一项内容业务，我从产品经理的角度来经营我的频道。这是我的产品。我们知道何时开始投资更好的视觉效果的转折点是当我们连续制作出几个爆款视频时。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Now, another problem is the production costs. Despite spending over $1 billion on content from Hollywood talent, Quibby failed to produce any breakout hits. Now, as someone who got into content creation fairly recently, I genuinely think that there is no point in making large investments into production until you start feeling the content market fit, so to say. And to be clear, I'm not comparing myself to a media company with massive Hollywood investors. They're in a polar opposite scale. But nevertheless, this is a content business and I treat my own channel from a perspective of a product manager. This is my product. The point where we knew that it makes sense for us to start investing in better visuals was when we hit several consecutive breakout videos.</p>
</details>

当我们的频道在四月份只有500个订阅者时，我们的视频开始达到5万到8万的观看量，这对于我们当时的频道规模和订阅人数来说是一个巨大的数字。而我们在视频是用我的iPhone 13和一个80美元的柔光箱拍摄的情况下达到了这些观看量。我故意将所有预算保持在极低水平，因为我想看看我的内容是否能通过研究和内容本身的价值获得突破。因此，在你完全不确定你的内容是否会被观看的情况下，投入数十亿美元进行制作是毫无意义的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">When our channel had 500 subscribers back in April, our video started reaching 50 to 80,000 views, which was a massive number for our channel size at the time and given our subscriber count. and we hit those views when videos were filmed on my iPhone 13 with one $80 softbox. I deliberately kept everything extremely low budget because I wanted to see if my content could get breakout through the value of the research and the content that I produce. So, investing billions in production when you have absolutely no idea whether your content is going to be watched makes no sense.</p>
</details>

他们还有很多技术限制。该应用程序无法在社交媒体上分享内容，这阻碍了有机增长和口碑营销。而这正是现代内容平台的核心。用户无法截图，无法创建剪辑，也无法与朋友分享任何内容。最终结果是，Quibi在成立6个月内就宣布关闭。他们承认未能达到可持续的订阅用户数量以实现盈利。该公司将剩余的部分投资者资金作为善意退还，并解雇了近250名员工。Roku在2021年初以1亿美元收购了Quibi的内容库，并将其更名为**Roku Originals**。

<details>

<p class="english-text">They also had a lot of technical limitations. The app's inability to share content on social media prevented organic growth and word of mouth marketing. And that is the bread and butter of modern content platforms. Users could not take screenshots. They could not create clips. They could not share anything with friends. End result, within 6 months since inception, Quibby announced it shut down. They admitted to have failed to achieve sustainable subscriber numbers for profitability. The company returned some remaining investor funds as goodwill and laid off nearly 250 employees. Roku acquired Quibby's content library in early 2021 for hund00 million and rebranded it as Roku Originals.</p>

### 结论：构建可扩展AI业务的关键教训

构建一个可扩展的AI业务非常困难。对于大公司来说，它和对于初创公司一样困难。区别在于规模，但难度是相同的。不要高估模型而低估基本产品质量。要为无形劳动定价。要考虑基本的物理原理。在投资之前进行测试，并对照那些始终有效的枯燥产品管理指标进行基准测试。发布最小的、能够自给自足的产品，让AI放大一个已经坚实的产品。如果单位经济效益不能超越基线，那它就不是一个转型，也不是一项业务。你只是在构建一个演示，而演示是无法支付账单的。如果这个视频对你有帮助，请在评论中告诉我们你的想法。下次再见。

<p class="english-text">Building a scalable AI business is very hard. It's just as hard for larger corps as it is for startups. The difference is in the scale, but it's equally as hard. Don't overestimate the model and underestimate basic product quality. Price the invisible labor. Account for basic physics. Test before you invest and benchmark against the boring product management metrics that always work. Ship the smallest thing that pays for itself and let AI amplify an already solid product. If the unit economics don't beat the baseline, it's not a pivot and it's not a business. You're building a demo and demo doesn't pay the bills.
