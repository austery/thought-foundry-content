title: 财报解读：Salesforce AI 业务强劲，UiPath 首次盈利，Snowflake 为何意外下跌？
---

### 开盘回顾与盘后财报预告

好的，大家好，欢迎回到新一期的《市场收盘》。很抱歉我迟到了，今天真是疯狂的一天。但我们现在直播了，有很多内容要谈。盘后会有一些财报公布，其中一些非常重要。我们有 Salesforce (CRM)、Snowflake 和 UiPath。所以在接下来的 15 分钟里，我会在聊天区发起一个“哪家公司表现会更好”的投票。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market close. I am sorry I am late. It has been a wild crazy day. But we are live and we've got a lot to talk about. We got some earnings coming up after the bell. There's going to be some very important earnings. We got CRM, we have Snowflake, and we have Path. So, in the next 15 minutes, I'll put the which one outperforms poll in the chat.</p>
</details>

我们将看看这三家公司——Salesforce、Snowflake 和 UiPath——哪一家的表现会更出色。它们都是**SaaS**（Software as a Service: 软件即服务）领域非常重要的公司。其中 UiPath 是这三家公司中规模最小的，我们将看看它们会交出怎样的业绩。除了财报之外，今天还发生了一系列非常随机的事件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We are going to see which one of these companies outperform CRM, Snowflake, and UiPath. Very important companies in the SAS space. UiPath being the smallest out of these three. and we're gonna see what numbers that they put up. Outside of the earnings picture today, we had a bunch of things happen that just were super random on the day.</p>
</details>

首先是微软的头条新闻。顺便说一下，特斯拉正在上涨，我们稍后会谈到它。微软今天下跌了约 2%，盘中一度下跌 3%。The Information 发布了一篇文章，称微软的 AI 销售正在放缓，特别是在 **Co-pilot**（Microsoft's AI assistant: 微软的 AI 助手）方面。市场起初有些在意，后来又不太在意了。接着微软出面表示，这并不完全属实。现在，微软当天收盘下跌约 1.87%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Starting off with that Microsoft headline, Tesla, by the way, pumping. We'll talk about Tesla in a second. Microsoft down about 2% on the day. Microsoft was down 3%. The information put out an article that said Microsoft's AI sales are slowing down. In co-pilot, the market kind of cared, then the market didn't care, and Microsoft came out that said then they basically said, "Hey, this is not exactly true." And now Microsoft is down about 1.87% on the day.</p>
</details>

这基本上是今天开盘的情况。我们在盘前交易中是上涨的，但随后转为下跌。英伟达股价跌破 180 美元。不过，有一条关于英伟达的相当利好的消息，我们稍后会讨论。Amkor 今天大涨 7.86%，收于 4385 点。标普 500 指数，哇，盘中高点 684，我都没注意到。上涨了 0.5%。谷歌股价为 320 美元。我确实增持了英伟达。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, that kind of started off the day. We were green in the pre-markets and then we went red. Nvidia breaking below 180. You do have a pretty bullish Nvidia headline that we'll talk about in a second. Uh Amcor just a massive day up 7.86% 4385. The S&P 500. Wow. 684 high of day on the S&P. Didn't even see that. That's up half a percent. And then Google's at 320. I did buy more Nvidia.</p>
</details>

我在 180 美元时买入，现在是 179.64 美元，所以我的时机把握得真是绝了。我买入的原因是，今天整个市场的股票都在上涨，而英伟达却在下跌。那些作为英伟达衍生品的公司，比如 Amkor——没有英伟达就没有 Amkor——今天上涨了 8%，而英伟达却在下跌。市场对这个 AI 泡沫的恐惧程度以及他们如何低估英伟达，到了这个地步简直有点可笑。但无论如何，这似乎就是正在发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I bought it at 180. It's at 17964. So my timing is phenomenal. Uh the reason I bought it is just because I'm like everything was pumping today across the entire market and Nvidia's red the names that are derivative of Nvidia like an amcore. There is no AMCore without Nvidia is up 8% on the day and Nvidia's red. I mean it's kind of laughable at this point what's happening and how scared the market is of this AI bubble and how they're discounting Nvidia. But nonetheless that seems to be what is happening.</p>
</details>

UNH 当天上涨 5%，Oscar 上涨 1.72%。Robin Hood 有重大更新，上涨了 6.5%。Palantir 上涨 3%。像 Nebia 这样的公司不应该上涨，而英伟达却在下跌。这对我来说真的没什么道理，但我确实认为市场对英伟达的现状有点害怕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">UNH is up 5% on the day. Oscar is up 1.72%. Robin Hood we got a big update on them that's up 6.5. And then Palanteer that is up 3% on the day. like Nebia should not be up and Nvidia is down. It's it's really not making a lot of sense to me, but I do think the market is a bit scared of what's going on with Nvidia.</p>
</details>

### 英伟达动态：华盛顿游说与 Joe Rogan 播客

那么，英伟达发生了什么？有两条重要的头条新闻。让我先给你们看 30 分钟前刚爆出的那条。许多报道称，黄仁勋在华盛顿特区的办公室会见了迈克·约翰逊。现在我们可能知道原因了。彭博社报道，在立法者将一项提案从即将出台的国防法案中排除后，英伟达有望在游说方面取得重大胜利。该提案本会限制向中国和其他美国对手销售先进的 AI 芯片。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, what happened with Nvidia? There were two major headlines that are important. Let me show you the one that just broke 30 minutes ago. A lot of reports came out saying that Jensen was with Mike Johnson in his office in DC. Uh, and now we probably know why. Bloomberg, Nvidia is poised for a major lobbying win after lawmakers excluded a proposal from the upcoming defense bill that would have restricted sales of advanced AI chips to China and other US adversaries.</p>
</details>

基本上，看起来黄仁勋今天在华盛顿特区与政客们会谈，而彭博社的消息来源称，他似乎将确保即将通过的新 AI 法案中不包含一个名为 **Gain AI Act**（一项旨在限制向中国等国家销售先进 AI 芯片的法案）的部分。该法案会强制英伟达和 AMD 在向受禁运国家销售之前，优先满足美国客户的需求。这对 AMD 来说其实也相当利好，因为你不想让 AMD 无法向中国销售产品。那对他们来说将是一个巨大的收入来源，而 AMD 今天股价是上涨的。但英伟达却下跌了，这再次显得很奇怪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Essentially, it seems like Jensen was in DC today speaking to um the politicians and Bloomberg sources are saying that it looks like he's going to make sure that there is not a part of the new AI act that is coming through called the Gain Act, which would force Nvidia and AMD to prioritize US customers before selling to embargoed countries. This is actually really bullish for AMD as well because you don't want AMD to not be able to sell it to China. That would be a massive revenue source for them and AMD's up on the day. But Nvidia's red, which again is just weird.</p>
</details>

考虑到整个市场表现良好，这对我来说没什么道理。看到标普 500 指数距离历史高点不到 0.5% 是健康的，尽管标普中最重要的股票（占权重 8%）是下跌的。这意味着市场正在扩大，但同时也说不通，这就是我今天最终买入的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's not making a lot of sense to me given the entire market is doing well. It is healthy to see the S&P 500 um like less than half a percent away from all-time highs. Even though the most important stock in the S&P 8% of the waiting is uh red, it means we're broadening, but it also is not making a lot of sense, which is why I ended up buying today.</p>
</details>

第二个更重大的头条新闻是，英伟达的黄仁勋登上了 Joe Rogan 的播客，我觉得这非常酷。是的，黄仁勋还将在 10 分钟后在一个科技会议上发言。所以我们可能会在接下来的一小时内听到他的一些言论。但是，我们从这次与 Joe Rogan 的两个半小时访谈中得到了很多内容。我没想到这会在盘中发布，但它确实发布了。其中有一些非常精彩的片段。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second bigger bigger headline uh is Nvidia had Jensen on Joe Rogan and I think this was really cool. Yes, Jensen also will be speaking in 10 minutes at a tech conference. So, we'll probably get some quotes from Jensen over the coming hour. But, uh we got a lot of quotes from Jensen on this one. Two and a half hours with Mr. Joe Rogan. I did not expect this to drop during the middle of the day, but it did. There were some really good clips from it.</p>
</details>

我想给大家看一个片段，稍后我们会看更多。我们还有《纽约时报》举办的 **Dealbook conference**（由《纽约时报》举办的年度商业峰会），也从中得到了一些片段。但这里是黄仁勋谈论第一次有人想买他的超级计算机芯片时的情景。讽刺的是，那个人是埃隆·马斯克。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's the one clip I want to show everybody, and then we'll go through more of them later. We also had the Dealbook conference that happened with the New York Times and we got a bunch of clips from that. But here's Jensen talking about the first time someone ever wanted to buy his supercomputer chip. And ironically, it was Mr. Elon Musk.</p>
</details>

> 当我宣布这个东西时，世界上没有人想要它。我没有收到任何采购订单，一个都没有。没有人想买它，没有人想参与其中，除了埃隆。他在那个活动上，我们正在进行一场关于自动驾驶汽车未来的炉边谈话，他说：“你知道吗？我有一家公司可能真的需要这个。”
>
> 我说：“哇，我的第一个客户。” 所以，我对此感到非常兴奋。
>
> 他接着说：“嗯，是的。我们有这家公司，它是一家非营利公司。”
>
> 我脸上的血色瞬间褪去。[笑声] 我刚花了几十亿美元建造这东西，成本是 30 万美元，而一个非营利组织能付得起这笔钱的概率大约为零。他继续说，你知道，这是一家 AI 公司，是一家非营利组织，我们真的需要一台这样的超级计算机。所以我把它拿起来，为我们自己造了第一台。我们在公司内部使用它。我把一台装箱，开车送到旧金山，在 2016 年交给了埃隆。我走到二楼，他们都挤在一个比你这里还小的房间里，而那个地方后来变成了 OpenAI。
>
> 它现在已经不是非营利组织了吧？
>
> 他们不再是非营利组织了。是的。
>
> 事情就是这么奇怪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> When I announced this thing, nobody in the world wanted it. I had no purchase orders. Not not one. Nobody wanted to buy it. Nobody wanted to be part of it except for Elon. He goes, he was at the event and we were doing a fireside chat about the future of self-driving cars and he goes, "You know what? I have a company that could really use this."
>> 
>> I said, "Wow, my first customer." And so, so I was pretty excited about it.
>> 
>> And he goes, "Uh, yeah. Uh, we have this company. It's a nonprofit company."
>> 
>> and all the blood drained out of my face. [laughter] I just spent a few billion dollars building this thing cost $300,000 and you know the chances of a nonprofit being able to pay for this thing is approximately zero. And he goes, you know, this is a it's an AI company and uh it's a nonprofit and and uh we could really use one of these supercomputers. And so I I picked it up. I built the first one for ourselves. We're using it inside the company. I boxed one up. I drove it up to San Francisco and I delivered to Elon in 2016 and uh I walk up to the second floor where they were all kind of in a room this smaller than your place here and and uh uh that place turned out to be open AI.
>> 
>> >> It's not really uh nonprofit anymore though, is it?
>> 
>> >> They're not they're not nonprofit anymore. Yeah.
>> 
>> >> Weird how that works.</p>
</details>

我觉得那个片段非常有趣，埃隆成为第一个为现在的 OpenAI 购买那台超级计算机的人，而他现在已经不是 OpenAI 的一部分了，这相当有意思。但我们这里也有一段视频。我之前没看到，但黄仁勋确实在华盛顿，这不再是谣言了。这是他今天在华盛顿的一些评论。特朗普也在直播发布一项声明，我完全不知道是什么内容。我稍后会试着找出来，但他现在正在直播发布声明。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I thought that clip was very interesting and the fact that uh you know you had Elon be the first person to buy that's a supercomputer for what is now open eye which Elon is not a part of was pretty interesting. But yeah, we got a video right here as well. I did not see this but Jensen he absolutely there's it's a not a rumor anymore. He was at DC. Here's a little bit of his uh commentary in Washington today. Trump's also live making an announcement. I have no idea what this announcement is. I'll try to find out in a second, but he's making some announcement live right now.</p>
</details>

### 黄仁勋华盛顿现场评论

> ……让世界建立在美国技术之上。
>
> 对你们的芯片流向中国有任何担忧吗？
>
> 当然有。我们必须确保美国在任何时候都拥有最好的技术。但同时，美国的技术产业可以继续为世界服务，并赢得世界各地的市场。
>
> 有很多……抱歉，有很多对华鹰派人士……我们面临来自很多不同地方的竞争。有很多对华鹰派人士……
>
> 有很多对华鹰派人士非常担心，如果他们的芯片能够流向中国和其他国家，那将严重危及美国的安全。您对他们有什么想说的？
>
> 我们必须确保国家安全。记住，中国生产大量的芯片，他们的军队拥有充足的芯片和中国芯片来制造他们需要的任何东西。我们需要确保美国能够继续在全球技术领导地位上获胜。
>
> Gain AI 法案，您对它从参众两院版本的国防授权法案中被删除有何看法？
>
> 我认为这是明智的，因为 Gain AI 法案对美国的危害甚至比 AI 扩散法案更大。
>
> 但对于英伟达和其他公司生产的先进芯片，是否需要某种程度的保护？也许不像 Gain AI 法案那么极端，但类似的东西。
>
> 我们支持出口管制，我们相信美国应该始终拥有最好的技术。
>
> 您认为应该有联邦层面的 AI 法规，还是更倾向于各州自行制定？显然，总统希望看到联邦法规，而不是各州独立行动。您对此有何看法？
>
> 各州自行制定 AI 法规会让这个行业陷入停滞。

<p class="english-text">>> And have the world built on American technology.
>> 
>> >> Any concerns about your chips going to China?
>> 
>> >> Uh, of course there is. And uh we have to ensure that United States has the best technology at all times. Uh but that United States uh technology industry can continue to serve the world and and win markets around the world.
>> 
>> >> There are a number of sorry there are a number of China hawks who are we have lots of competition from a lot of different places. There are a number of China hawks.
>> 
>> >> There are a number of China hawks who are very concerned that if their chips are being able to go to China and other countries, that's really going to compromise US security. What's your message to them?
>> 
>> >> We have to ensure national security. Remember, China makes plenty of chips and their military has plenty of ample chips and chines chips to uh to to build whatever they need. We need to ensure America can continue to win the technology leadership position around the world. Act 200 from both chambers versions of the NDAA.
>> 
>> >> I'm sorry.
>> 
>> >> The uh Gain AI act, how do you feel that both versions have been stripped from the NDAA? Now,
>> 
>> >> uh I think that's that's wise because the gain AI act uh is even uh more uh uh detrimental to the United States than the AI diffusion act.
>> 
>> >> Does there need to be some degree though of protection on advanced chips that Nvidia and others produce? Maybe not something as extreme as the gain AI act, but something within that vein.
>> 
>> We support export control and we believe that United States should have the best technology all the time.
>> 
>> >> Do you think there should be federal uh regulations on AI or would you prefer state byst state? Uh obviously that's the the president wants to see federal regulations as opposed to individual states. What what's your take on
>> 
>> >> statebystate AI regulation would would drag this industry into a halt.</p>
</details>

好的，这些都是黄仁勋一段时间以来一直在说的内容。我们稍后会对此有更多想法。AMD 股价为 217 美元，英伟达仍在抛售。Meta 现在也在抛售。哇，不知道 Meta 有什么新闻，但它下跌了 1%。我们稍后会看到 Salesforce、Path 和 Snowflake 的财报。Meta 股价 639.50 美元，下跌 1%。Amkor 44 美元，创下日内新高和年度新高，上涨 8.2%。标普指数仍在坚守，但收盘时略有下跌。亚马逊 232 美元，仍在下跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So some of the same stuff that Jensen has been saying for a while. We'll get some more thoughts on that in a bit. Uh AMD at 217, Nvidia still selling off right here. Meta now selling off as well. Wow. Don't know what the headline is on Meta, but that's down 1%. We're going to get earnings in a bit for Salesforce Path and Snowflake. 63950 on Meta. That's down 1%. Amcor 44. New highs of day, new highs for the year. That's up 8.2%. S&P still holding on, but you have a little bit of a red close. Amazon 232, that one's still red.</p>
</details>

### 其他市场关键动态

Robinhood 股价触及 134 美元，Palantir 176 美元，Palantir 转绿而英伟达转红。通常过去几周这种情况没有发生，但我猜市场对英伟达有些别的感觉。特斯拉今天上涨，是基于那条关于机器人技术的新闻，我们可能会有机器人沙皇，就像 AI 和加密货币沙皇一样，这就是特斯拉从中受益的原因。亚马逊今天没有从中受益，但特斯拉股价在 445 美元。AMD 是绿色的，然后是 Meta，不确定为什么在抛售，但我会试着找出相关新闻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Robin did hit 134, pounder 176, pounder going green and Nvidia going red. Usually that hasn't happened for the past couple of weeks, but I guess the market is feeling something about Nvidia. Tesla's up today based on that robotics news that we might have robotic zar um like an AI and cryptozar and that's why Tesla's getting the benefit of that. Amazon not getting the benefit of that today, but Tesla right there at 445. AMD is green and then Meta, not sure why that's selling off, but I'll try to get the headline for that in a second.</p>
</details>

所以，黄仁勋今天在国会山发表了各种言论。Joe Rogan 的播客对今天的股价并没有真正产生影响，彭博社关于 Gain Act 对英伟达有利的头条新闻也没有。现在，我们不知道英伟达是否能够向中国销售，但我们今天得到的消息和头条新闻无疑增加了英伟达获得中国收入的可能性，这是利好消息，但市场似乎并不太在意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you had Jensen on Capitol Hill today said a bunch of different things. The Joe Rogan podcast not really making a difference for the stock today, and neither is this Bloomberg headline about the gain act being in Nvidia's favor. Now, we don't know if Nvidia is going to be able to sell into China, but the news and the headline that we got today definitely makes it more likely that Nvidia is going to be able to get that China revenue, which is bullish, but it seems like the market doesn't care that much about it.</p>
</details>

今天我们看到的另一个关于 Robinhood 的重磅新闻，这家公司再次让我感到无比自豪，简直难以言表。在他们针对特斯拉股票的匹配推广活动中，转入了 14 亿美元。这是两周前，弗拉德说：“嘿，如果你有一些特斯拉股票，转到 Robinhood，我们会给你 2% 的奖励。” 平均账户规模为 50 万美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, the other big headline we had today on Robin Hood, again, this company just continues to make me so unbelievably proud. It's it's hard to even put into words. 1.4 billion of transfers during their math promotion just for Tesla stock. This is when two weeks ago Vlad said, "Hey, if you have some Tesla, we'll give you 2% to come to Robin." The average account size was $500,000.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，这家公司正在成为一个无论你有 5 美元还是 5 亿美元都可以使用的平台。在不到一个月的时间里，14 亿美元的净存款流入 Robinhood，这相当于他们上个季度（第三季度）全部净存款的 16%。所以这对 Robinhood 来说非常非常令人兴奋。这也很好，可能让 Robinhood 获得了更多的动力，这就是为什么该股今天上涨的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, the company is just becoming a platform for anyone, whether you have $5 or $500 million to come to the platform. And uh 1.4 4 billion in net deposits, which is 16% of the entire net deposits they had last time in Q3 coming into Robin Hood uh in basically less than a month. So very very exciting for Robin Hood. That was also good. That probably allowed Robin Hood to get a bit more momentum and that's why that stock is up on the day.</p>
</details>

我不认为有关于谷歌 TPU 的头条新闻。有人说这可能是英伟达下跌的原因。我今天没有看到任何类似的消息。但英伟达在这里正遭遇抛售，股价 179.35 美元。下跌 1% 算不上真正的暴跌，但无论如何，当天是下跌的。CrowdStrike 上涨 1%，从 504 美元反弹至 522 美元。博通当天曾下跌 2%，现在是 330 或 380 美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think there was a Google TPU headline. Some people are saying that could be the reason why Nvidia is down. I did not see anything like that today. But Nvidia is getting a dump right here. 17935 dump being 1% is not really a dump but nonetheless that is down on the day. Crowd Strike that's up 1% that reversed that was at 504 now that's at 522. Broadcom was down 2% on the day now that's at 330 or 380.</p>
</details>

Salesforce 上涨 2%，Path 上涨 4%，然后是 Snowflake，今年以来上涨了 60%，今天上涨了 2.38%。在聊天区的投票中，41% 的人认为 Snowflake 会表现更好。我对这场比赛没有偏好，完全不知道会是哪一个。所以我们将在接下来的 10 分钟内看看哪一个表现更好，然后继续。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Salesforce is up 2%. Path is up 4% and then you have Snowflake which is up 60% for the year. That is up 2.38%. On the poll in the chat 41% of you say Snowflake will outperform. I have no dog in this race. Have no idea which one it's going to be. So, we'll see in the coming uh next 10 minutes which one outperforms and we'll go from there.</p>
</details>

唯一可能影响宏观经济的头条新闻，除了我们今天早上得到的 ADP 就业数据（负 3.2 万，预期为 4 万，这对降息其实是好事，因为它意味着劳动力市场正在走弱），是彭博社的一篇报道，称一些人对凯文·哈塞特（Kevin Hassett）可能成为美联储主席感到不满。原因很明显，但有些人仍然对他与特朗普不够独立感到不安。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other only headline that could be affecting the macro outside of the ADP payroll numbers we got this morning which was negative 32,000 versus 40,000 expected. actually good for getting a rate cut because it means the labor market is weakening is there's this Bloomberg report that some people are not happy if Kevin Hassid would become the Fed chair and the reason for that which it's kind of obvious but nonetheless some people are upset that he's not really independent from Trump.</p>
</details>

所以，债券投资者告诉彭博社，他们认为特朗普会和哈塞特关系非常密切，他们更希望是像克里斯托弗·沃勒（Christopher Waller）或里克·里德（Rick Rieder）这样的人。现在，我不知道特朗普是否会为了安抚债券市场而选择一个不那么独立的人，因为他非常希望利率下降。所以，也许因为这个原因不会是凯文·哈塞特，但考虑到他多么希望利率下降，我认为最终可能会是凯文·哈塞特。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um and [laughter] so you have bond investors telling Bloomberg uh yeah we think Trump is going to be super tight with Hasset and we'd rather want someone like Christopher Waller or Rick Reer Now, I don't know if Trump's going to try to appease the bond market by getting someone who's less independent because he really wants these rates to come down. So, maybe it's not Kevin Hassid for that reason, but given how much he wants the rates to come down, I think it might end up being Kevin Hassid.</p>
</details>

每个政治政府都会选择自己想要的人担任要职。这些决定从来都不是完全中立的，总会有一些偏见。问题是，如果哈塞特被宣布为下一任美联储主席，市场会作何反应。标普指数 683.82，当天上涨 32%，这还不错。尽管标普指数中的一些大盘股受到了冲击。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, every political administration gets to pick their own people that they want to be in positions of power. Those are never fully neutral decisions and there's always some bias there. question is going to be how the market reacts to Hasset if he is announced as the next uh as the next fetch here. 683 82 on the S&P. We got 32% on the day. That is not bad to see. Although you have some of the bigger names in the S&P taking a hit.</p>
</details>

从更广泛的市场来看，AppLovin 当天上涨，Verizon 上涨，英特尔上涨，Aera 上涨，MicroStrategy 上涨。比特币在早上因微软报告下跌后，今天出现了大幅上涨，现在基本回到了 93,000 美元。三天前它还在 83,000 美元。所以很高兴看到它在今天收盘时获得了一些动力。

<p class="english-text">Broader markets. Apploving is up on the day. Verizon's up. Intel's up. Aera's up. U Micro Strategy is up. Bitcoin got a big move today after falling in the morning on that Microsoft report. Now basically back to 93,000. This thing was at 83,000 three days ago. So, it is nice to see it getting a little bit more momentum right here as we get into the close for the day.</p>
</details>

好了，我们开始吧。我们有三份重要的财报。让我们看看这一切将如何发展。谢谢大家的到来。12 月 3 日，星期三，下午 4 点。股市现已收盘。

### 盘后财报速递：三家公司表现迥异

好了，今天结束了。标普指数收绿。早上在微软报告发布后我们是下跌的。如果你没听到微软的消息，那是一条头条新闻说微软正在降低其销售目标。微软出来说那不是真的。尽管如此，它仍然影响了全天的市场。标普 500 指数确实出现了复苏，收于 683.83，上涨 0.34%。英伟达当天收红，下跌 1%。Meta 在收盘前被抛售了约 1.16%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, we are done for the day. S&P got that green close. We were read in the morning after the Microsoft report. If you didn't hear the Microsoft news again, it was a headline that said Microsoft is lowering their sales target. Microsoft came out that said that's not true. Nonetheless, still affected the market throughout the day. We did get a recovery on the S&P 500 68383. That's up 0.34%. Nvidia ended red on the day down 1%. Meta got sold off right into the close by about 1.16%.</p>
</details>

特斯拉大幅上涨 4%，AMD 上涨 1%，Nebas 收盘时也上涨，报 256 美元。顺便说一句，克莱默说要卖掉 Iran，买入 Crowdstrike。Iran 上涨了 7%。所以，有时候你只需要利用这个信号。Iran 在昨天下跌 15% 后反弹了 7%。Rocket Lab 上涨 6.75%。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Tesla got a big move up 4%. AMD was up 1%. Nebas did get a green close at 256. By the way, Kramer said to sell Iran and buy Crowdstrike. Iran's up 7%. So, of course, sometimes you just got to use the signal. And I right there back up 7% after falling 15% yesterday. Rocket Lab 6.75%.</p>
</details>

对于这家火箭实验室来说还不错，它得到了一些青睐。然后是 AS，所以太空概念股受到了一些追捧，当天上涨了 8%。Palantir 也达到了 176 美元的水平，并且我们收盘价高于 176 美元，这对 Palantir 来说也是个好消息。好了，让我们看看。如果你持有这些股票，请在聊天中告诉我。Salesforce 已经在上涨，还有 Snowflake 和 Path。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="class="english-text">Not bad for the Lab of Rockets, that one got some love. And then AS. So, the Space names getting some love. that was up 8% on the day. Palanteer as well got to that 176 level and we closed above 176 which was also nice to see for Palanteer on the day at 176. All right, so let's see. Let me know in the chat if you own any of these names again. Salesforce, which is already pumping, Snowflake and Path.</p>
</details>

这三家公司。Salesforce 上涨 6%。Salesforce 上涨 6%。让我们看看他们的财报数据。我不认为数据会非常惊人，但我确实认为这只股票下跌 30% 可能已经超卖了。他们仍然是一家年收入 400 亿美元的公司，今年下跌了 30%，所以市场肯定会从 Salesforce 的财报中找到一些喜欢的东西。另外，顺便说一下，特朗普现在的声明是关于汽车行业的，要撤销那些法规。我们早上谈过这个。所以我们稍后会得到一个特朗普讲话的片段。但是，现在直播的声明是关于汽车行业，以及撤销法规以增加和授权制造业生产。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Those are the three companies. Salesforce up 6%. Salesforce is up 6%. Let's see what we can get on their numbers. I don't think the numbers are going to be amazing, but I do think the stock being down 30% is probably oversold. They're still a company doing 40 billion in revenue, down 30% for the year, so there's got to be something that the market will like from Salesforce. Also, by the way, the Trump announcement right now is about the auto industry and rolling back those regulations. We talked about that in the morning. So, we'll get a clip in a second of what Trump had to say. But, uh, the announcement that's live right now is about the auto industry and rolling back regulations to increase and authorize manufacturing production.</p>
</details>

Salesforce 的数据显示，他们营收未达预期，但**EPS**（Earnings Per Share: 每股收益）超出预期。营收未达，EPS 超出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Salesforce numbers, they missed on revenue. They beat on EPS. Missed on revenue, beat on EPS or Salesforce.</p>
</details>

不过，EPS 超出预期 14%。这是一个巨大的胜利。EPS 为 3.25 美元，而预期为 2.86 美元。营收同比增长 9%，EPS 同比增长 35%。营收方面，差距非常小，102.5 亿美元对 102.7 亿美元。所以营收方面无足轻重。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">14% beat on EPS though. That's a big one. 14% beat on EPS 325 versus 286. Revenue is up 9% year-over-year. EPS is up 35% year-over-year. Revenue, it's a very small miss. 10.25 versus 10.27. So revenue is inconsequential.</p>
</details>

这是一个巨大的胜利。对于他们这样规模的公司来说，14% 的增幅是实实在在的。这确实是一个巨大的胜利，当天上涨了 7%。这正是华尔街想看到的。现在的问题是，这是税务问题，还是会计问题？是 Agent Force 带来了更多 AI 提升利润率的举措吗？还是他们裁员了，所以获得了一次性的利润增长？我的意思是，14%。我没想到会有这么大的超预期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's a big beat. 14% for a company of their size is legit. That's very legit. I mean, that's a massive one. 7% on the day. This is exactly what the street wanted to see. Now the question is, is this a tax thing, accounting thing? Is it agent force leading to more initiatives of AI for margin enhancement? Are they laying off people so they get to get the onetime margin increase? I mean, 14%. I did not expect that big of a beat.</p>
</details>

Salesforce 上一次 EPS 超出 14% 是什么时候？所以，这绝对值得一次上涨，我们将看看华尔街有多喜欢它。当天上涨了 8%。还没有 Snowflake 或 Path 的消息。有 Five Below 的消息，这是一家类似一元店的公司，上涨了 1.3%。他们营收超出预期 6%，为 10.3 亿美元，而预期为 9.83 亿美元。营收同比增长 23%。他们营收超出预期 6%，EPS 超出预期 162%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When's the last time Salesfor beat by 14% on EPS, too? So, that's something that definitely deserves a pump and we're gonna see how much the street likes it. That's up eight% on the day. Don't have snowflake or path yet. do have five below which is like a dollar store. Uh that's up 1.3%. They beat by 6% on revenue 1.03 billion versus 983 million. And then revenue is up 23% year-over-year. They beat revenue uh revenue by 6%. EPS they beat by 162%.</p>
</details>

华尔街预期 26 美分，他们公布的是 68 美分。又一家零售股，基本上可以看作是一元店的邻居。如果消费者真的那么疲软，为什么他们的 EPS 能超出近 175%？可能年收入低于 4 万美元的消费者在 Five Below 购物，他们的 EPS 却实现了三位数的超预期。这真的很奇怪。这真的让人质疑消费者疲软的说法。这不像 Abercrombie 或 Urban Outfitters 那样的高档品牌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Street wanted 26 cents. They came in with 68 cents for five below. Another retailer stock basically think of them as like a dollar store adjacent. Why are they beating EPS by almost 175%. If the consumer is that weak, like the consumer that's probably making under 40,000 a year is shopping at five below, they're beating EPS by triple digits. That's just weird. It's really questioning this consumer is weak narrative. It's not just like a fancy brand like like uh Abberrombi or Urban or Urban Outfitters from from last week.</p>
</details>

Salesforce 仍然上涨 8%。还没有 Snowflake 的消息，也没有 Path 的消息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Salesforce still up 8%. Don't have Snowflake. Don't have Path yet. Don't have Snowflake. don't have path yet. Let's see if we can get some update on those numbers. But Salesforce is up again. Salesforce beat by 14% on EPS. That's a big one. And revenue is in line with expectations.</p>
</details>

我们有一些来自 Benioff 的引述。让我们看看他说了些什么。

> 谢谢。谈到道琼斯指数中的蓝筹股，Salesforce 的财报已经公布。Sema Modi 为我们带来了数据。你好，Sema。
>
> Morgan，Salesforce 的利润表现非常强劲。调整后每股收益为 3.25 美元，而预期为 2.86 美元。营收符合预期。同样关键的是，当前剩余履约义务为 294 亿美元，同比增长 11%，高于华尔街的预期。CEO 马克·贝尼奥夫在新闻稿中表示，其积压订单预示着未来强大的收入渠道。他补充说，Agent Force 和 Data 360 是增长的动力。
>
> 谈到 Agent Force，公司的 AI 代理平台，围绕此有很多讨论。投入生产的账户，即从试点阶段过渡到部署 AI 代理的客户，环比增长了 70%。这比上一季度的 60% 有所增加。他们还补充说，50% 的 Agent Force 和 Data 360 客户正在回头并扩大他们的合作关系，这比上一季度的 40% 有所增加。同样值得注意的是，Agent Force 和 Data 360 的**ARR**（Annual Recurring Revenue: 年度经常性收入）达到了 14 亿美元，同比增长 114%。
>
> 所有这些显然都增强了管理层的信心，因为公司正在提高其第四季度和全年的指引。股价也做出了反应，在盘后交易中上涨了 9%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We got some quotes from Beni off. Let's get to this and see what he had to say.
>> 
>> >> Thank you. Well, talking about blue chip names in the Dow, Salesforce earnings are out. Sema Modi has the numbers for us. Hi, Sema. Morgan, a very strong beat on Salesforce's bottom line. Adjusted earnings of $3.25 versus the $286 estimate. Revenue came in line. Also key is the current remaining performing obligations of 29.4 billion. That is up 11% year-over-year and higher than Wall Street estimates. CEO Mark Benoff on the in the press release says its backlog is signaling a powerful pipeline of future revenue. He adds that agent force and data 360 are momentum drivers. So speaking of agent force, the company's AI agent platform. There's been a lot of discussion around this accounts in production. That means clients that are transitioning from pilot phase to deploying AI agents has increased 70% quarter over quarter. Now that is up from 60% in the previous quarter. They also add that 50% of agent force and data 360 customers are coming back and expanding their partnership. that is up from 40% last quarter. Also worth noting annual recurring revenue for Asian Force and Data 360 reaching $1.4 billion, up 114% year-over-year. So all of this is fueling confidence clearly from management because the company is raising its guidance for the fourth quarter and the year. The stock is responding up 9% here in overtime.</p>
</details>

看起来这是 Salesforce 一次实实在在的超预期。他们说他们的 AI 产品正在带来更多客户的采纳和留存，这意味着 Agent Force 可能正在变得合法化，市场也喜欢这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> It looks like this is a legit beat from Salesforce. They're saying their AI product is leading to more and more customer adoption and retention. which means Agent Force is becoming legit potentially and the market likes it.</p>
</details>

另一方面，Snowflake 实现了双重超预期，但股价下跌了 7%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Snowflake on the other hand, double beat but down 7%.</p>
</details>

双重超预期但下跌 7%。Snowflake 每股收益 35 美分，预期 31 美分，超出 13%。营收 12.1 亿美元，预期 11.8 亿美元，超出 3%。营收同比增长 29%，每股收益同比增长 75%。华尔街不喜欢它，不确定为什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Double beat but down 7%. Snowflake 35 cents versus 31 cents expected. That's a beat by 13%. Revenue 1.21 billion versus 1.18 billion. That's a beat by 3%. Revenue is up 29% year-over-year. EPS is up 75% year-over-year. Street does not like it. Not sure why.</p>
</details>

我试着看看能否得到他们的指引更新，如果他们能在这些水平上超预期，并且 Salesforce 也能拿出这样的数据，你不会认为他们会降低指引。这只股票在财报前已经上涨了 60%，也许只是定价过高了，但这很奇怪。Snowflake 下跌 7%，并继续下跌。Salesforce 上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, I'll try to see if we can get some guidance update from them and if they're beating on these types of levels and and Salesforce is putting up these numbers. You you you wouldn't think they are like reducing guidance. The stock was up 60% going into it. Maybe it was just priced uh aggressively, but that's weird. Snowflake down 7% continues to fall. Salesforce up.</p>
</details>

Salesforce 没能守住 7% 的涨幅。Salesforce 开始有所回落，但至少还守住了 4%。上个季度，Salesforce 也出现了反转。虽然不像从 10% 跌到负 10% 那么剧烈，但确实有反转。所以我们要关注这一点。UiPath 还没有他们的财报。Five Below 上涨 2%，Snowflake 仍然下跌 6%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Salesforce not holding that 7% move to the upside. Salesforce starting to see it come down a little bit. At least it's holding 4%. Last quarter. Salesforce reversed as well. It wasn't as aggressive as like a 10% to like negative 10%, but it did have a reversal. So, we got to watch out for that one and see. UiPath still don't have their numbers. Five Below, that's up 2%. Snowflake still down six.</p>
</details>

我预感 Snowflake 很快也会反转。不确定是什么样的膝跳反应导致它下跌。Salesforce 当天上涨 3%。Snowflake 并没有在营收上失手，Salesforce 反而失手了，但他们只差了 0.01%，所以这不是华尔街会关心的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I could see Snowflake reversing pretty quick as well. Not sure what the knee-jerk reaction is to get that one down. Salesforce is up 3% on the day. Um, Snowflake did not miss on revenue. Salesforce did, but they missed by like 0.01%. So, that would not be something the street cares about.</p>
</details>

C3.ai，我不知道他们今天有财报，但他们确实有。他们的 EPS 也超出了 24%。他们亏损 25 美分，而预期是亏损 33 美分。营收 7500 万美元，预期 7400 万美元。营收同比下降 20%，EPS 同比下降 317%。这很难看。但他们在营收和利润上都超出了预期。C3.ai 当天股价下跌 4.7%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">C3 AI, I didn't know they had earnings today, but they did. They also have a beat on EPS by 24%. They lost 25 cents or 25. Yeah, lost 25 cents versus losing 33 cents expected. Uh revenue 75 million versus 74 million. Revenue is down 20% year-over-year. EPS is down 317% year-over-year. That's ugly. Uh but they did beat expectations on the top and the bottom. C3 AI is down 4.7% on the day.</p>
</details>

这家公司在 2024 年表现非常好，因为人们在股票代码中看到了 AI，所以这只股票被炒高了。但他们无论如何都没能兑现那些业绩。我的意思是，在 90 天内，在世界上最热门的行业 AI 领域，只有 7500 万美元的收入。这根本不是真正的增长。所以 C3 在盘后一度上涨到 15.88 美元，但现在下跌了 3%。Snowflake 仍然下跌 7%，Salesforce 仍然保持 4% 的涨幅。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This was a company that had a really good 2024 because people saw AI in the ticker and this one got pumped up. uh they have not been able to live up to those results by any sense of the imagination. I mean $75 million in 90 days in the hottest sector in the world which is AI. I mean it's it's it's just not real growth at all. So C3 right there did get a move to 1588 after hours but now it's down 3%. Snowflake still down seven. Salesforce still holding up to 4% right now.</p>
</details>

### UiPath 历史性突破：首次实现盈利

好了，下一个是 Path。下一个是 Path。我们得看看 Path 能否拿出一些好数据。我知道很多人对 Path 感到兴奋，即使他们今天只是把它当作一笔交易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. So the next one is path. The next one is path. That's the one we got to see if Path can put up some numbers. I know a lot of people are getting excited about Path and just even if they're taking it as a trade today.</p>
</details>

所以我们将看看 Path 能否拿出一些数据。如果有人在财报前买了 Salesforce，请在聊天中告诉我，因为你们现在做得很好，这只股票在上涨。我对 Path 有什么看法？我完全不知道。我真的毫无头绪。我们今天会发现他们是否能拿出业绩来维持更多的这种势头。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, so we're going to see if Path can put up some numbers. Let me know in the chat if anyone bought Salesforce right before the print because you are doing well as this one is up. What do I think of Path? I have no idea. I genuinely have no clue. We are going to find out today if they can put up the results to kind of keep more of this of this momentum.</p>
</details>

Snowflake，我们得到了一些更多的数据。自由现金流 1.13 亿美元。**RPO**（Remaining Performance Obligations: 剩余履约义务）同比增长 37%，达到 78 亿美元。他们现在在福布斯全球 2000 强中有 750 个客户。下个季度的指引是 12 亿美元。财年指引是 45 亿美元。我看到的关于 Snowflake 的一切都是好的。我不知道为什么它会下跌。Path 上涨了 2%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, Snowflake, we're getting some more numbers. Free cash flow 113 million. RPO is up 37% year-over-year 7.8 billion. They now have 750 customers in the Forbes Global 2000. Guidance for 1.2 billion next quarter. Fiscal year 4.5 billion. Everything I'm looking at on Snowflake is good. I don't know why that's down. Path is up 2%.</p>
</details>

小幅上涨。小幅上涨。还没有数据，但有一点点上涨。我看到有几个人说他们为财报买入了 Path。哦，现在下跌了。不，现在上涨了。不，现在下跌了。下跌 1.2%。刚才还上涨 2.3%。现在持平。市场对这个感到困惑。不，现在又上涨了 2%。现在下跌 0.27%。要么是业绩非常好，没人相信，要么是业绩不好但没那么糟，或者我们可能最终会持平。我认为 Path 的隐含波动是 7%，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Little bit of a move. Little bit of a move. No numbers yet, but a little bit of some green. I see a couple people say they're in path for earnings. Oh, now it's down. Nope, now it's up. Nope, now it's down. Down 1.2. It was just up 2.3. Now it's flat. The market's confused on this one. No, now it's back up two. Now it's down 027. Either the results are really good and no one believes it or the results are bad but not that bad or we might just end up getting a flat. I think the implied move is 7% on path, right?</p>
</details>

Path 的财报出来了。好的，让我看看。让我们看看能否得到 Path 的数据。顺便说一下，Meta 挖走了苹果的顶级设计师。自 2015 年以来一直担任苹果 UI 设计主管的 Allan Dy 已经跳槽到 Meta，这是今天早上的另一个头条新闻。苹果股价也创下历史新高。但是 Meta 持续挖走这些人。好了，PATH 双双超出预期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">7% on path. Um path is out. Okay, let me see. Let's see if we can get the numbers on path. By the way, Meta got Apple's top designer. Allan Dy, who is the head of Apple's UI design since 2015, has left to Meta, which was another headline this morning. Apple also hit all-time highs. Um, but Meta continues to take these people. All right, so PATH double beat</p>
</details>

每股收益 16 美分，预期 15 美分，同比增长 45%，超出预期 7%。营收 4.11 亿美元，预期 3.92 亿美元，超出预期 5%。营收同比增长 16%，每股收益同比增长 45%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">16 cents versus 15 cents EPS. That's up 45% year-over-year. That's a beat by 7%. Revenue 411 versus 392, that's a beat by 5%. revenue is up 16% year-over-year. EPS is up 45% year-over-year.</p>
</details>

客观地说，从盈利角度来看，这并不那么令人印象深刻。我对这家公司一无所知，但当你谈论一个大的变动时，你可能希望看到一个更大的超预期。不过话又说回来，也许华尔街仍然会对此感到满意，但我认为华尔街正在试图弄清楚他们有多喜欢它。现在它上涨了 5%，5.4%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, objectively speaking, it's not that impressive from an earnings perspective. I don't know anything about the company, but you know, when you're talking about a big big move, you might want to see a bigger a bigger beat. Now, then again, maybe the street is still going to be okay with it, but I think the street's trying to figure out how much they like it now. Now it's up 5% 5.4.</p>
</details>

他们每股收益超出 1 美分，营收超出几百万美元。我的意思是，这很好。问题是华尔街会认为它有多好？Path 有 7% 的涨幅。Salesforce 仍然下跌，哦抱歉，Snowflake 仍然下跌 5%。而 Salesforce 没能守住 8% 的涨幅。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They beat by 1 cent on EPS and they beat by a couple million on revenue. I mean it's good. Question is how good is the streak going to think it is? 7% you have that move on path. Salesforce still down or sorry snowflake still down 5%. And Salesforce not holding on to that 8% move.</p>
</details>

UiPath 现在上涨 6.3%。好的，华尔街似乎喜欢它。它守住了涨幅。再次强调，这是一个小幅的超预期，但足以让股价上涨。这只股票今年迄今也只上涨了 15%。所以，这对这只股票来说并不是一个疯狂的年份。现在的问题是，它能否正式守住涨幅？这是 PATH 的数据。EPS 超出 7%，营收超出 5%。营收同比增长 16%。再说一次，这并不是真正惊人的增长，但同样，这只股票在过去两年里一直死气沉沉。所以，任何程度的增长也许都能让市场更兴奋一些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">UiPath now 6.3%. All right. Streets seem to like it. It's holding on to the move again. Small beat, but enough of a beat to get this. The stock was only up 15% year to date as well. So, it's not like it's been a crazy year for the stock. Question now is, can it officially hold up? There are the numbers for PATH. 7% on EPS, 5% on revenue. I mean, revenue. So, revenue is up 16% year-over-year. Again, that's, you know, it's not really amazing growth, but again, the stock was dead for the past two years. So, any level of growth maybe is what gets this read a bit more excited.</p>
</details>

这是 PATH 的第一个 GAAP 盈利季度吗？如果是这样，那将改变一切。如果这真的是他们的第一个盈利季度，那就不仅仅是 EPS 超出 7% 的问题了。这将是他们盈利轨迹上的一个巨大范式转变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is this PATH's first gap profitable quarter? Is that I mean, let's go to their website. If Well, that changes everything. If if this is actually their first profitable quarter. No, no, that's a big that's not just a 7% beat on EPS then. That's a massive uh paradigm shift in in terms of the trajectory of their earnings if this is actually their first profitable quarter.</p>
</details>

是的，这是他们第一次……哇，1300 万美元的利润。我想，这可能就是它真正上涨的原因。忘了 EPS 的超预期吧，他们实现了盈利。就是这样。营收 4.11 亿美元，ARR 17 亿美元，公司历史上首次实现 1300 万美元的 EPS。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Uh pulling up their website here right now. Let's pull this. Yeah, this is their first Wow, $13 million of profit. I mean, that there you go.

Revenue of 411 million, ARR of 1.7 billion, EPS of 13 million for the first time in the company's history.</p>
</details>

CEO 表示：“我对第三季度的业绩感到满意，ARR 达到 17 亿美元，这证明了我们的专注、持续的执行力，以及我们看到的客户在整个企业范围内扩展代理自动化（agentic automation）的势头。企业正在加速其 AI 和自动化战略，他们正在寻找一个统一的平台，而不是独立的工具。我们能够将确定性自动化、代理自动化和编排功能整合到一个可信的治理系统中，这是一个真正的差异化优势。它为客户带来了有意义的成果，并使我们在年底收官时处于有利地位。”

<p class="english-text">CEO says, "I'm pleased with the third quarter of results, delivering AR of 1.7 billion, a testament to our focus, consistent execution, and the momentum we're seeing as customers scale agentic automation across the enterprise.

Our ability to bring deterministic automation, agentic automation, and orchestration together in one trusted governance system is a true differentiator. It's delivering meaningful outcomes for customers and positions us well as we close out the year.</p>
</details>

他们首次实现盈利，利润为 1300 万美元，营收同比增长 16%。CFO 表示：“我们第三季度业绩强劲，全面超出指引，并实现了我们的第一个 GAAP 盈利季度。我们在加强运营节奏和执行力方面取得的进展正在我们的业绩中体现出来，我们对年底前的形势感到乐观。”

UiPath 股价继续上涨，当天涨幅接近 13%。哇，好的。如果你持有它，恭喜你。如果你在交易它，也许现在是卖出的时候。但如果你认为数据那么好，也许这笔交易就变成了一项投资。Path 现在上涨 15%，继续走高。

And if you are uh if you are trading it, maybe this is the time to sell. if you're trading it after hours, but maybe the trade just turned into an investment. If you think the numbers are that good, 15% now for path as that one moves higher.</p>

看到它在良好业绩的推动下获得这种势头，非常非常令人高兴。再说一次，盈利能力应该在股市中得到回报。我们太多次奖励那些没有任何盈利，但有一个有趣故事的公司。看到一只股票如果真的拿出数据就能上涨，是件好事。

<p class="english-text">Very, very nice to see it get this type of momentum on a good result. And again, profitability should be rewarded in the stock market. I mean, so many times we reward companies that don't put up any earnings, but they have a fun narrative. It's nice to see a stock get a move if it actually puts up the numbers.</p>

### Dealbook 峰会精选：Karp、Fink 及 Bent 的犀利观点

好的，让我们看看 Karp。Karp 也参加了会议，并发表了很多不同的看法。我们还没有得到任何疯狂的 Palantir 头条新闻。再说一次，他们大约一个月前发布了财报。所以从那以后没有看到太多，但这里有几个 Karp 在 Dealbook 会议上的片段。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, let's look at Karp. So Karp was also at the conference. Had a bunch of different things that Karp had to say. Uh we haven't gotten any crazy pounder headlines. Again, they had earnings about a month ago. So since then haven't seen too much but here are a couple clips from Karp at the dealbook conference.</p>
</details>

> 这个文化中最大的问题是什么？我告诉你最大的问题。没有人相信这些机构是可信的。为什么他们不相信它们是可信的，我也很难相信？因为这些商业领袖做出了完全愚蠢的决定，然后他们得到了救助。一年后，他们拿着巨额奖金，而美国人民得到了什么？什么都没有。这是一个巨大的问题。
>
> 就像，如果你做出……所以，我认为真实的版本是，当我十年前我们开始互相烦扰地交谈时，我做了很多决定。希望我今天还像十年前一样烦人，或者更烦人。当我做出……你知道，Palantir 做出的每一个决定：上市，构建没人要的产品，企业级大数据集，进入政府市场，承认美国的优越性，支持精英管理，推出 AI 平台，质疑 AI 模型在没有编排的情况下能否实际运行，我们的每一个本体论，每一个决定都被认为是愚蠢的。
>
> 你知道我真正开始欣赏资本主义的什么吗？所有那些做出正确决定的人都破产了，或者正在倒闭，或者现在不得不抄袭我们。微软推出了本体论。每个人都想做 FDES。每个人基本上都在抄袭我和 Palantir。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> What is the biggest problem in this culture? I'll tell you the biggest problem. No one believes the institutions are credible. And why don't they believe they're and I struggle to to believe they're credible too? Because these business leaders make completely stupid decisions and they get bailed out. A year later they're getting huge bonuses and what do the American people get? Nothing. And that's a huge problem.
>> 
>> Like if you make like so I think the real version is like I made a lot of decisions when we began talking annoying each other 10 years ago. Hopefully I'm annoying you as much as 10 years ago. uh it or more uh when when when I made a you know this every decision Palanteer made FDA's
>> 
>> going public building products no one enterprise large data sets going to government acknowledging American superiority being pro meritocracy launching an AI platform calling into question that AI models would actually be able to perform without orchestration every single one uh every single ourtology every single one of those was viewed as stupid. You know what I actually have grown to appreciate about capitalism? All the people who made the right decisions went broke are going out of business or are now have to copy us.
>> 
>> Microsoft launchtology. Everyone wants to do FDES. Everyone basically copies me and Palanteer.</p>
</details>

你可以看出 Karp 在提出这些论点时，拥有他一整年都保持的热情。他是对的，很多其他公司已经决定接受 Palantir 那些他们曾经说不真实的东西。这是 Palantir 发布的 Karp 在会议上的另一个片段。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> You can tell Karp has the passion that he's been having all year when making these arguments. And he is right that a lot of other companies have decided to embrace the aspects of Palunteer that they used to say were not real. Here's the other clip that Palanteer posted from Karp at the conference.</p>
</details>

> 在这个国家，有 1% 的人口在监狱里。1% 的人曾经在监狱里，因此没有任何权利。你知道你进监狱会发生什么吗？他们把你从你的孩子身边带走。你知道这发生在谁身上吗？不成比例地发生在工薪阶层，不成比例地发生在黑人和西班牙裔男性，以及底层阶级的白人男性身上。
>
> 关于他们的成千上万篇文章在哪里？没人在乎，他们不在乎，因为它既不服务于强迫我投票给某个政党的能力和愿望，这基本上剥夺了我所有的权力。这实际上就是它的作用。如果我同意说这是世界上最糟糕的事情，我基本上就放弃了我的投票权。我的票不是给你的，我的票是给这两个问题的。
>
> 他们不在乎的第二个原因是因为不知何故，没有人对那些人有同情心，因为我们中没有人真正与那些人打交道。在 Palantir，我们站在美国工薪阶层的这边。我们支持去参军的人。我们拯救他们的生命，我们让他们更安全地回家。我们的 AI 实际上让工人更富有，更有价值。
>
> 尽管有那些报道，但爱我的那一千到一千五百万人，他们中的一半在我们身上赚了很多钱。你知道他们是什么样的人吗？他们就像我这样的人，认为，你知道吗，我们必须做得更好。当然，我们必须做得更好。

<p class="english-text">>> In this country, it you have 1% of the country in prison. 1% who were in prison and therefore have no rights. Do you know what happens to you when you go to prison? They take you away from your kids. You know who that happens to? disproportionately workingclass, disproportionately black and Hispanic men and white men in the underclass.
>> 
>> Where are the thousands of articles about them? Nobody cares and they don't care because it does not either serve the ability the the desire to force me to vote for one party, which basically takes away all my power. That's effectually what it does. If I agree to say this is the worst thing in the world, I essentially have given up my vote. My vote is not for you. My vote is for these two issues. The second reason they don't care is because somehow no one has empathy with any of those people because no one none of us really deal with those people. At Palunteer, we are on the side of workingclass Americans.
>> 
>> We support people who go to the military. We save their lives. We bring them home safer. Our AI actually makes workers more wealthy, more valuable. And the 10 to 15 million people that love me despite what's written, half of them made a lot of money on us. And you know what they're like? They're like people like me who think, you know what, we have to do better. Of course, we have to do better.</p>
</details>

然后这是 Karp 的另一个片段，基本上是在说，嘿，《纽约时报》，你们写了一些关于我们的垃圾文章。还记得六月份那篇关于 Palantir 是一个数据库的文章吗？这是 Karp 的回应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And then this is the other clip of Karp basically saying, hey, the New York Times, you wrote in, you wrote some crappy articles about us. Remember back in June, there was that article about pounding a database. This was Karp's response to it.</p>
</details>

> 老实说，我对《纽约时报》有点生气。主要原因是我相信你们的使命。如果你在听，我相信你们的使命。当你写一篇技术上完全无知的文章时，你在技术人员面前会失去很多信誉，这是事实。那篇关于我们是监视工具的文章，你知道，里面全是暗示。是的，但问题是，你在任何一个懂行的人面前都失去了信誉，这对我们的民主是有害的。
>
> 让我问你这个，再看看左派和右派。我想对观众说的一件事是，你们很多人认为我是对的，但你们知道你们的配偶、亲戚、孩子、同事如果知道了会感到震惊。你们最好大声说出来，因为每个认为我是个荒谬的法西斯主义者的人，他们都在大声说。他们每天都在写。如果你们不大声说出来，那些不同意我或认为我很蠢的人……我经常不同意我自己。所以你必须大声说出来，你不能在极左、极右的白痴为他们的观点大声疾呼时责怪他们。你为你的观点大声疾呼了吗？你告诉你的同事了吗？我敢打赌在《纽约时报》，很多人读了那篇关于我们的文章后感到羞愧。你去找你的编辑说：“你怎么能写出技术上如此无知的东西？” 他可能是一个法西斯主义者，但这在技术上是无知的。让我问你一个不同的问题。你做了还是没做？因为如果只有我一个人在发声，你将得到一个在右派、左派和中间派都充满技术无知的世界。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And I'm a little bit pissed at the New York Times, honestly. since you and the main reason is I believe I believe in your if you're listening I believe in your mission when you write a technically completely illiterate article you lose a lot of credibility if people are technical and that's just a fact that article about us being a surveillance thing you is like where it's all implied what we yeah but the problem is you lose credibility with anyone who goes on the thing and then and that's damaging for our democracy
>> 
>> >> let me ask you this again look left and right the one thing I would say to people in the audience, you know, you you know you a lot of you think I'm right and you know your spouse, your relative, your child, the person at work would be horrified if they knew it. You better speak up because everyone who thinks I'm a ridiculous fascist, they're speaking up. They write about it every day. If you do not speak up, the people who are disagreeing with me or think I'm stupid a lot, I disagree with myself. So you have to speak up and you cannot blame the far-left, far-right idiots when they speak up for their views. Do you speak up for your views? Where do you tell your colleague? I bet you at the New York Times a lot of people read that article about us and were ashamed.
>> 
>> Did you go to your editor and say, "How could you write something that's technically illiterate?" They a guy might be a a fascist, but this is technically illiterate. Let me ask you a different question. Did you or didn't you? Because if I'm the only one speaking up, you're gonna get a world of technical illiteracy on the right, on the left, and in the middle.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，看，那篇文章出来的时候确实不是一篇好文章。不管你喜不喜欢 Palantir，那篇文章都很可笑，而且根本没有现实依据，以至于 Palantir 不得不邀请文章的编辑到他们的办公室，在提出这类主张之前，先实际演示一下他们的平台。所以我能理解为什么 Karp 会说：“伙计，你们简直是胡说八道。你们有很大的影响力。我现在就要大声说出来，告诉你们有多胡说八道，并告诉观众，当别人胡说八道时，他们需要站出来指责。” 所以，我认为他在这里提出这个论点是合理的。Palantir 当天收于 176 美元，上涨 3.3%，或者说 3.1%。Salesforce 上涨 5.2%，Snowflake 在盘后仍然下跌，然后 UiPath 当天上涨 9%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Alex, help me with this. Um, a lot of people,
>> 
>> >> I mean, look, it was not a good article when it came out. I mean, whether you like Pounder or not, the article was laughable and it it really had no basis in reality to the point where Pounder had to literally invite the editors of the article to come to their office to actually have a demo of their platform before making these types of claims. So, I can understand why Karp's just like, "Dude, you guys are full of [ __ ] You guys have a lot of influence. I'm going to speak up right now and tell you how full of [ __ ] you are and tell the audience that they need to call people out when they're full of shit." And so, I think it makes sense for him to make that argument right here. Pounder 176 on the day, up 3.3%, Salesforce uh or 3.1%. Salesforce up 5.2, Snowflake still down after hours, and then UiPath up 9% on the day.</p>

### 黄仁勋深度访谈：AI 将创造 90% 的世界知识

这是黄仁勋的另一个片段，我认为很重要。这是……我们将会在未来几天看到更多这样的片段，但这是黄仁勋谈论未来世界知识将更多地由 AI 创造。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">here's another Jensen clip that I thought was important. Uh this is and and we're going to get a lot more of these clips over the coming days, but this is Jensen talking about more of the world's knowledge getting created by AI</p>
</details>

> 未来，世界上越来越多的知识将是综合生成的。你知道，直到现在，我们拥有的知识是我们自己生成、传播、互相发送、放大、补充和修改的。我们改变它。在未来，几年后，也许两三年后，世界上 90% 的知识很可能将由 AI 生成。
>
> 这太疯狂了。
>
> 我知道。但这没关系。
>
> 但这没关系。
>
> 我知道。原因如下。让我告诉你为什么。
>
> 好的。
>
> 因为，我从一本由一群我不认识的人编写的教科书中学习，或者从一本我不认识的人写的书中学习，与从 AI 计算机生成的知识中学习，对我来说有什么区别呢？这些计算机正在吸收所有这些信息并重新合成。对我来说，我认为没有太大区别。我们仍然需要进行事实核查。我们仍然需要确保它是基于基本的第一性原理，我们仍然需要做所有这些事情，就像我们今天做的一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and more and more of knowledge in the world will be generated synthetically going forward. You know, until now the knowledge that we've we have are knowledge that we generate and we propagate and we send to each other and we amplify it and we add to it and we modify it. We change it. In the future, in a couple of years, maybe two or three years, 90% of the world's knowledge will likely be generated by AI.
>> 
>> >> That's crazy.
>> 
>> >> I know. But it's just fine.
>> 
>> >> But it's just fine.
>> 
>> >> I know. And the reason for that is this. Let me tell you why.
>> 
>> >> Okay?
>> 
>> >> It's because um what what difference does it make to me that I am learning from a textbook that was generated by a bunch of people I didn't know or written by a book that you know from somebody I don't know uh to uh knowledge generated by AI computers that are assimilating all of this and reynthesizing things. To me, I don't think there's a whole lot of difference. We still have to we still have to fact check it. We still have to make sure that it's you know based on fundamental first principles and we still have to do all of that just like we do today.</p>
</details>

这次黄仁勋的采访有很多精彩瞬间，也非常自然。我看了前 15 分钟，Joe 第一次见到黄仁勋是在一次 SpaceX 的活动上，第二次是黄仁勋和特朗普在一起，他们打电话给 Joe，因为他们想谈论最新的芯片。所以他们如何联系上的过程其实挺有趣的，但整个过程非常自然。我认为这个播客本身最终做得相当不错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> A lot of good moments from this Jensen interview. It was very natural too. I watched the first 15 minutes of it and um you know the first time Joe met Jensen was at a SpaceX event and then the second time was Jensen and um Trump were together and they they called up Joe because they wanted to talk about the newest chip. So, it was actually pretty funny how they how they connected, but it was very very natural. And I think the podcast itself ended up being ended up being pretty song strong.</p>
</details>

### 宏观视角：预测市场与 Tom Lee 的年终展望

预测市场。预测市场世界里发生了什么？我们不断得到更多更新。有些人可能已经看到了，Kalshi 现在与 CNN 合作，提供预测市场的实时更新，我认为这是一件大事，因为主流媒体往往会出错。预测市场正确的次数远多于错误的次数。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Prediction markets. What's going on in the world of prediction markets? So, again, we're getting more and more updates. Some people might have seen this already, but Khi is now partnering with CNN to provide real-time updates on prediction markets, which I think is a pretty big deal because mainstream media tends to get it wrong. Prediction markets have gotten it right way more than they have gotten it wrong.</p>
</details>

因此，随着主流媒体生态系统越来越多地与预测市场合作，这一点将变得非常重要。除此之外，Fanatics 的 Michael Rubin 推出了一个预测市场平台。所以，很多人知道 Fanatics 是因为体育博彩或者购买帽子、球衣之类的东西。他们在 10 个州推出了预测市场，还有 24 个州即将推出，他们现在正与 Kalshi 和 Polymarket 一起进入预测市场的竞争。Polymarket 的应用昨天在应用商店排名第一，而 Kalshi 的估值达到了 110 亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, that one is going to be very important as more and more uh of the ecosystem of the mainstream media partners with prediction markets. On top of that, Fanatics, Michael Rubin, um they launched a prediction market platform. So, Fanatics, which a lot of people know for buying like either for sports betting or like buying hats and jerseys and stuff. They launched a prediction markets in 10 states with 24 to come and they are now entering the race for prediction markets with Kali and Poly Market. Poly Markets app is now number one on the app store that came out yesterday and uh Khi raised at an 11 billion valuation.</p>
</details>

所以，似乎世界越来越多地转向这些预测市场，因为他们逐渐意识到这可能是比我们拥有的许多其他真相来源更好的真相来源。我认为它们会一直存在下去，这意味着更多的交易量、更多的增长、更好的流动性、更好的分销，以及许多其他参与者进入这个领域。因此，这也应该是整个生态系统的一个顺风。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it continues to seem like more and more of the world is transitioning to these prediction markets as they continue to uh basically realize this might be a better source of truth than a lot of the other sources of truth that we have. And I think they're here to stay, which just means more volume, more growth, better liquidity, better distribution, a lot of other players entering in the space. And so, that should be a tailwind for the overall ecosystem as well.</p>
</details>

这是 Tom Lee 关于我们应该迎来年终反弹的六个理由的论点。我会稍微加快一点速度，但它已经是一个相当快的视频了，大约两分钟。让我们在这里播放一下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This was Tom Lee's argument for the six reasons we should get an endofear rally. I'll speed it up a little bit, but it's it's already a pretty quick video. It's about two minutes. So, let's uh let's play that right here.</p>
</details>

> 那是美联储开始的时候，也许更重要的是，**量化紧缩 (QT)**（Quantitative Tightening: 中央银行减少其资产负债表规模的货币政策）正在结束。
>
> QT 开始于 4 月 22 日，那是美联储开始缩减其资产负债表的时候，并计划于 12 月 1 日结束，也就是今天。
>
> 上一次 QT 结束是在 2018 年 1 月到 2019 年 9 月。如果我们回顾那段时间，当美联储在 2019 年 9 月 4 日结束 QT 时，标普指数在 16 个交易日内上涨了 17%。所以我认为，考虑到同样几天的滞后，同样的效果将会发生，这是积极的。这对股票来说是好事。
>
> 现在，在东部时间周日晚上，日本银行加息的几率实际上跃升至 61%。这在周一开盘前给加密货币和期货市场带来了一些压力。但请记住，美联储正朝着相反的方向前进。12 月美联储降息的几率现在是 89%。
>
> 我们还必须记住，美联储很快将宣布新的主席。现在市场认为会是凯文·哈塞特，事实上，如果你看 Polymarket，哈塞特成为美联储主席的几率现在是 73%，这在一个月内上升了很多，其次最可能的是没有宣布，几率为 17%。所以这两者之间占了 90% 的结果，这对市场来说是温和的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's when the Fed began and maybe more importantly quantitative tightening is ending.
>> 
>> Now QT began on April 22nd. That's when the Fed began to shrink its balance sheet and is set to end on December 1, which is today.
>> 
>> The last time there was QT ending was from January 2018 to September 2019.
>> 
>> And if we look back at that period of time, when the Fed ended QT on September 4th, 2019, the S&P embarked on a rally of 17% over 16 trading days. So I think with again the same kind of couple day lag, I think the same effect is going to happen, which is positive. And that's for stocks.
>> 
>> Now on Sunday evening, Eastern time, the Bank of Japan's odds of a hike actually jumped to 61%. That puts some pressure on crypto and futures markets overnight before the Monday session. But keep in mind the Fed is moving in the opposite direction. The odds of a Fed cut in December are now 89%.
>> 
>> And we also have to keep in mind the Fed is soon set to announce a new Fed chair.
>> 
>> Now markets believe it's Kevin Hasset and in fact if you look at Poly Market the odds of Hasset being Fed chair is now stands at 73% which has risen a lot in the last month and the next most likely is no announcement at 17%. So between the two that's 90% of the outcomes which is novish for markets.</p>
</details>

Tom Lee 的论点非常简单，基本上是量化宽松即将到来，影子美联储即将到来，盈利强劲，市场在年底前应该会很好。你知道，这是我们一段时间以来一直在谈论的同样的故事，但如果情况确实如此，那也不是世界上最糟糕的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So pretty simple argument by Tom Lee essentially um QE is coming shadow Fed is coming earnings are strong market should be good towards the end of the year and you know it's the same narrative we've been talking about for a while but if that is the case then that would not be the the worst thing in the world.</p>

### 黄仁勋最新演讲：阐述 AI 平台的分层结构

产品是纯粹的技术，为了使用它，你必须在其上为各种行业创建软件和应用程序。你知道，如果你看看今天大多数的科技公司，有些可能是在社交媒体领域或其他领域。我们的商业模式纯粹是技术。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Product is pure technology and in order to use it, you have to create software and applications for various industries above it. You know, if you look at most of the technology companies today, some of it could be in social media roles or something else. our business model is purely technology.</p>
</details>

AI 和我们的技术的工作方式是，最终分析，技术平台是分层构建的，这也是我们将其视为平台的原因之一。你站在它的顶端。一个应用程序或一个行业站在那个平台的顶端。那个平台从底层的能源开始。本届政府立即产生如此巨大影响的原因之一，就是其支持能源增长的倡议，其对能源的态度是，如果我们没有能源，我们就无法让这个新产业蓬勃发展，这绝对是真的。所以第一层是能源，第二层基本上是芯片和系统，但芯片，这就是英伟达的用武之地。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now the way that that AI works and and uh our technology works is that in the final analysis the technology platform is built in layers and that's one of the reasons why we think of it as a platform. You're standing on top of it. An application or an industry stands on top of that platform. That platform starts with energy on the bottom. One of the reasons why why uh this administration has made such a huge difference right away if it's is this pro- energy growth initiative its attitude about energy is that if we don't have energy we can't enable this new industry to thrive it is absolutely true so layer one is energy layer two are essentially the chips and systems but the chips that's where Nvidia comes in</p>
</details>

第三层是一大堆软件，我们在我们的芯片之上构建了一大堆软件，我们因一个名为 **CUDA** 的软件而闻名。但我们创造了数百种不同的软件，使人们能够在不同的科学领域、语言、图像或任何其他领域，如机器人技术和制造业等，进行 AI 研究。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">layer three is a whole bunch of software and we build a whole bunch of software on top of our chips and we're well known for this piece of software called CUDA. But there's hundreds of different pieces of software that we create that enables people to do AI for different fields of science or language or images or whatever it happens to be, robotics and manufacturing and such.</p>
</details>

但第三层被称为基础设施，基本上是软件。现在人们历史上认为基础设施主要是云，但越来越重要的是要认识到基础设施包括土地、电力、外壳，因为这些……我稍后会谈到，这个行业催生了另一个全新的行业，我稍后会回到这个话题，但第三层基本上是基础设施，而那个基础设施包括金融服务，因为我们做的事情需要巨大的资本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> But that third layer is called infrastructure. basically software. Now people historically have thought of infrastructure really as cloud but increasingly it's really important to realize that infrastructure includes land power shell because these are and I'll speak about this in a second that this industry
>> 
>> spawn another industry altogether and I'll come back to that but the third layer is basically infrastructure and that infrastructure includes financial services because it takes an enormous amount of capital to do what we do</p>
</details>

历史上，所有这些软件，也就是上一层，也是人们谈论 AI 时主要关注的地方，那就是 AI 模型。这当然是革命性的，比如 ChatGPT，Anthropic 在 Claude 上的出色工作，谷歌在 Gemini 上的工作，以及 XAI 在 Grok 上的工作。但重要的是要认识到，这些只是世界上 150 万个 AI 模型中的四个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And historically all of that software the layer above that and this is where people largely focus on when they talk about AI which is the AI models. This is the revolutionary of course Chad GPT uh incredible work that anthropic does with claude and uh Google does with Gemini uh what XAI does with Grock. But the important thing to realize those are four of the one and a half million AI models in the world.</p>
</details>

AI 不仅仅是理解英语或语言的智能，它还是理解基因、蛋白质、化学物质、物理定律的 AI。理解量子的 AI，理解物理表达的 AI，也就是机器人技术。理解跨长时间序列模式的 AI，金融服务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> AI is not just intelligence that understands English or language, but it's AI that understands
>> 
>> genes, proteins, chemicals, the laws of physics. AI that understands quantum. AI that understands physical articulation, otherwise known as robotics. AI that understands patterns across long sequence of time, financial services,</p>
</details>

AI 能够纵向理解跨多种模式的信息，比如医疗保健。所以 AI 拥有所有这些不同的触角和领域。我们谈论的只是这一个领域。我们必须非常小心地理解，AI 基本上跨越了每个科学领域的每种信息形式，跨越了每个行业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> AI that understand longitudinally across multiple modalities, healthcare. And so AI has all of these different reaches and domains. We talk about this one area. We just have to be very careful to understand that AI AC spans basically every form of information across every field of science across every single industry.</p>
</details>

全球有 150 万个 AI。在此之上是所有的应用程序，我们永远不应忘记，最终分析，这些 AI 模型是技术，但技术是为了赋能应用和使用，无论你是在医疗保健领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One and a half million AIs around the world. On top of that are all the applications and we never should forget that in the final analysis these AI models are technologies but technologies are about enabling application and use whether you're in health.</p>
</details>

好的，这就是我们从黄仁勋那里得到的内容。我会在聊天中留下链接，如果有人想继续听的话。再说一次，很多内容都是我们听过黄仁勋说过很多次的，但他正在向更广泛的受众演讲，让他们了解 AI 的发展情况。我今天确实增持了英伟达。我的意思是，我真的很困惑市场如何对 Nebius 和 Amkor 感到兴奋，虽然我很高兴这些股票今天表现很好，但英伟达怎么就被卡住了？这很奇怪。没有英伟达，很多这些公司都不会存在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> All right. Uh that is what we got for Jensen. I'll leave the link right here in the chat if anyone wants to continue listening to it. Again, a lot of the same stuff that we have heard Jensen say many times, but he is speaking to much broader audiences to learn about what's going on with AI. I did buy more Nvidia today. I mean, I really am confused how the market is getting excited about Nebius and Amcore, which very happy those names did well today, but how is Nvidia stuck and Like it's weird. You don't have a lot of these names without Nvidia.</p>
</details>

所以，无论市场对英伟达是泡沫有什么偏见，黄仁勋继续为它的真实性辩护，并用数据证明，我认为这是看涨的。现在，一些空头说黄仁勋不应该上 Joe Rogan 的节目，因为他太想炒作股票了。我的意思是，也许有这个论点，但话说回来，黄仁勋应该回应谷歌 TPU 的事吗？他们应该在 Deepseek 期间说些什么吗？我的意思是，他是一个非常注重内容的 CEO。他拥抱独立媒体，他拥抱社交媒体。而 Joe Rogan 不是什么随意的播客。那将会有成千上万的人收听，他们可能完全不知道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so whatever bias the market has against Nvidia being a bubble, Jensen continuing to make the argument for why it's real and then proving it with the numbers, I think is bullish. Now, some of the bears are saying Jensen shouldn't be going on Joe Rogan because he's trying to pump the stock too much. I mean, maybe there's an argument there, but then again, like, should Jensen have responded about Google TPUs? Should they have said anything during Deepseek? I mean like he is a very pro-content oriented CEO. He's embracing independent media. He's embracing social media. And Joe Rogan is not some random podcaster. I mean, that's tens and tens of millions of people that are going to be listening to that that probably have no idea.</p>

我的意思是，我的姐姐仍然一无所知。我在感恩节期间谈论聊天机器人如何工作时，她不知道英伟达是聊天机器人背后的原因。我的意思是，大多数人不知道 GPU 是什么，也不知道 GPU 是实现 AI 所必需的。这是世界上大多数人的情况。因此，随着越来越多的人认识到它的价值，这方面的教育非常重要。所以我不认为他上这些播客是看跌的。我认为这只是他在传播信息。

<p class="english-text">I mean, dude, my my sister still had no clue. I was talking over Thanksgiving how chatb works. She didn't know that Nvidia is the reason for chat. I mean, most people have no idea what a GPU is or that a GPU is what's necessary to make AI happen. That's that's the majority of the world. And so the education of that is very important as more people recognize how valuable it is. And so I don't think it's bearish that he's going on these podcasts. I think it's just him getting the the message out there.</p>

对于那些错过这条新闻的人，Robinhood 有一个重大更新，14 亿美元，这是他们月平均存款率的 16%，发生在 11 月份，仅仅是因为他们为特斯拉股票提供的 2% 匹配。平均账户规模为 50 万美元。

所以 Robinhood 正在继续成为 Arie 在 2023 年 6 月创造的词——一个“资产漩涡”。我的意思是，如果一年前的看空理由是这是一个只有 1 万美元用户的 meme 股交易应用，那么现在它正在成为一个拥有 50 万、500 万、5000 万、5 亿用户的平台，很多大人物和大账户都在加入这个平台。所以像 Hood 这样的公司正在获得更多的动力。

<p class="english-text">So Robin Hood continues to just become as Arie coined back in June of 2023 an asset vortex. And I mean, dude, if the bare case was a year ago that this is a meme stock trading app with people that only have $10,000, this is becoming a platform for people that have 500,000, 5 million, 50 million, 500 million, like a lot of big people in big accounts are uh are joining the platform. So, you're getting a lot more momentum for a company like Hood there.</p>

我想差不多就是这样了。然后我们还有周五。所以这是 12 月开始的一个快节奏的一周，到目前为止还不错。是的，我看到了 Caper 股票。显然 Skrey 做空了它，结果它涨了 500%。上涨了 371%。我对它一无所知，但基于他们发布的药物结果，这是一个巨大的日子。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Um I think that's pretty much it. And then we got Friday. So this was a quick week to start off December and so far it's holding up. Yes, I saw Caper stock cap. Apparently Skrey was short. The thing went up like 500%. um up 371%. Don't know anything about it, but massive massive day based on the drug results that they they put out.</p>

好了，今天就到这里。再次感谢大家的到来。我们明天早上再见。今天的大部分头条新闻都与我们从这次 Dealbook 峰会上得到的许多片段有关。我们明天早上会有更多这些片段。再次，黄仁勋上 Joe Rogan 的节目，我们可能会得到更多关于那方面的报道。但总的来说，我认为今天的主要头条是这篇彭博社的文章。不是今天早上出来的微软的负面报道，那感觉像是一个世纪前的事了，但那是今天早上。他们无缘无故地制造了那么多喧嚣，但是彭博社关于英伟达很可能赢得游说努力，以建立一个最终向中国销售的框架的文章，那是一件大事。所以希望我们能看到这是否能继续下去。然后是以太坊的 Fusaka 升级，希望对大家都有好处。好了，就到这里。谢谢大家。感谢。我们明天市场开盘时再见。大家再见。祝你们有美好的一天。

<p class="english-text">So, there you go. That is it for me. Thank you again everyone for being here. We'll be back tomorrow morning. Most of the headlines today have to do with a lot of the clips we got from this Dealbook Summit. We'll have more of those clips tomorrow morning. Again, Jensen on Joe Rogan. We'll probably get some more coverage on that. Um, but all in all, I think the major headline of the day was this Bloomberg article. Not the Microsoft hit piece that came out this morning, which feels like a lifetime ago, but that was this morning. And they created so much hoopla for no reason, but the Bloomberg article about Nvidia winning a lobbying effort most likely to have a framework to eventually sell into China. That's a big deal. And so hopefully we see if that can continue going forward. And then you have this Fusaka upgrade for ETH which hopefully does well for everybody. All right, that's it for me. Thank everybody. Appreciate it. I will see you guys tomorrow on the market open. Bye everybody. Have a great day.</p>
