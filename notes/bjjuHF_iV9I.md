### 安大略省妇科护理现状

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您正在收听《**Mistreated**》。我是**Nam Kiwanuka**。在**安大略省**，**家庭医生**是医疗系统的门户，包括为专科医生提供转诊。如果您是近200万没有**家庭医生**的**安大略省**居民之一，并且需要看专科医生，比如**妇科医生**，那么获得所需护理可能会非常困难。即使有转诊，**妇科**的候诊时间也很长。如果需要手术，时间会更长。**安大略省妇女健康联盟**（**Women's Health Coalition of Ontario**）2025年2月的一份报告指出，**妇科**护理的候诊时间“长得令人无法接受”，一些三级中心的候诊名单上有800到1500名患者，而且“最复杂的病例面临两到三年的手术延误，导致严重的健康后果，并显著降低生活质量”。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: You're listening to **Mistreated**. I'm **Nam Kiwanuka**. In **Ontario**, **family doctors** are the gateway to the health care system, including providing a referral for a specialist. If you're one of the nearly 2 million **Ontarians** without a **family doctor** and need to see a specialist, say a **gynecologist**, it can be incredibly challenging to get the care you need. Even with a referral, wait times for **gynecology** are long. And if you need surgery, they can be even longer. A February 2025 report from the **Women's Health Coalition of Ontario** indicates that wait times for **gynecological care** are quote unacceptably long with some tertiary centers having weight lists of 800 to 1,500 patients and that the quote most complex cases face delays of two to three years for surgery leading to serious health consequences and significantly reduced quality of life.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 根据为医生和医疗专业人员提供的在线出版物**Medscape**，从影像学检查和诊断到手术，患者就医过程的每个环节都存在重大延误。在**COVID-19**大流行开始之前，**渥太华**从诊断到治疗的平均时间是7到10年。此后，候诊时间又增加了2年，一些患者报告首次评估延误了12年。复杂病例的女性可能需要等待两到三年才能进行手术。通常，到那时病情已经非常严重，需要更严重的干预。未经治疗的**子宫内膜异位症**可能导致肾脏衰竭和肠梗阻，而**子宫肌瘤**可能长成两到三磅重的肿瘤，从而导致大出血和不孕。这份报告来自2025年7月。今天，我们与**安大略省医学协会**（**Ontario Medical Association**）主席**Zanab Abdur Ramen**医生对话。我们将与她讨论**OMA**在为**安大略省**居民和医生争取权益方面所做的工作，以及我们目前在**安大略省**公共医疗保健领域看到的危机。她现在加入我的节目。**Zanab Abdraman**，欢迎来到播客。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: According to **Medscape**, an online publication for physicians and health care professionals, major delays occur at every point in the patient journey from imaging and diagnosis to surgery. Before the **COVID-19 pandemic** began, the average period from diagnosis to treatment in **Ottawa** was 7 to 10 years. Since then, weight times have increased by 2 years, and some patients report a 12-year delay for initial assessment. Women with complex cases can wait two to three years for surgery. Often the condition is so far advanced by that time that it requires more serious intervention. Untreated **endometriosis** can lead to kidney death and bowel obstruction and **fibroids** can grow into two and three pound tumors thus resulting in massive bleeding and infertility. And that reporting is from July 2025. Today we're speaking with **Dr. Zanab Abdur Ramen**, the president of the **Ontario Medical Association**. We're talking to her about the work the **OMA** does in advocating for **Ontarians** and for physicians and the crisis we're seeing in public health care in **Ontario**. She joins me now, **Zanab Abdman**. Welcome to the podcast.

</details>

**Zanab Abdraman**: 非常感谢您的邀请。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zanab Abdraman**: Thank you so much for having me.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您能告诉大家您是做什么的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Um, can you tell everybody what you do?

</details>

**Zanab Abdraman**: 我叫**Zanab Abdraman**。我是一名**过敏症专科医生**和**临床免疫学家**。我还是一名**儿科医生**，目前也是**安大略省医学协会**的主席。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zanab Abdraman**: So, my name is **Zanab Abdraman**. I'm an **allergist** and **clinical immunologist**. I'm also certified as a **pediatrician** and currently I'm also the president of the **Ontario Medical Association**.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 是的，您是**安大略省医学协会**第144任主席。**OMA**是什么？它做什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Well, yes, you are **Ontario Medical Association**'s 144th president. What is the **OMA** and what does it do?

</details>

**Zanab Abdraman**: **安大略省医学协会**是**安大略省**所有医生的代表机构。我们代表所有执业医生、退休医生以及正在接受培训的医生。因此，我们为我们的会员以及医疗保健系统争取权益，因为那是我们工作、生活和发挥作用的地方。我们倡导医生的福祉，也倡导医疗保健系统的福祉，以及我们患者的福祉，以便他们能够以最简单、最容易的方式在医疗保健系统中就医。当您说您是主席时，我当时想，嗯。因为您非常谦逊，但当您成为主席时，您也创造了历史，成为**OMA**首位黑人女性主席。这没错吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zanab Abdraman**: So, the **Ontario Medical Association** is the representative body of all the doctors of **Ontario**. So, we represent all the doctors in practice, retired, and those also in training. So we advocate for our members as well as for the health care system because that's where we work and live and function. Uh so we advocate in terms of you know wellness for our physician and also wellness for the health care system and for our patients so that they can have navigate the health care system in the easiest simplest way possible. When you said that you were the president, um, I was like, hm. Because it's a you're very humble, but when you became president, you also made history as the **OMA**'s first black woman president. That's correct.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 这对您意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: What does that mean to you?

</details>

**Zanab Abdraman**: 您知道，对我来说，这意味着其他人现在会看到并说：“你知道吗，我也可以担任那个职位。”我认为在所有领导层面拥有**代表性**非常重要。嗯，我想到我自己，在我的日常工作中，我看到很多小黑人女孩，她们有点震惊，然后会告诉她们的妈妈说：“她长得像我。”她们的妈妈会说：“是的，你也可以成为她。你也可以成为医生。”我希望现在她们会看到并说：“我也可以成为医生。我也可以成为医生协会的主席。我真的可以成为任何事情。”所以，对我来说，这意味着很多。我认为这对我们整个社区都意义重大。嗯，我想有些人可能听到这些话，但不能完全理解其重要性，因为如果你不习惯在权威场所看到像你一样的人，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zanab Abdraman**: You know, for me, it means that others are going to now look over and say, you know what, I could be in that position, too. It's really important to have **representation**, I think, at all levels of leadership. Um, I think of just even for myself in my practice, you know, day-to-day like I see lots of little black girls and they come in and they're a bit shocked and they'll say this their mom, they're like, "She looks like me." And their mom's like, "Yeah, you could be her. You could be the doctor." And I hope now they'll look and say, "I could be the doctor. I could be the president of the doctors. I could be anything really." So, for me, it means a lot. It means a lot for just, I think, our community at large. Um, I think some people might hear that and not fully understand the magnitude of that because if you're not used to seeing people that look like you in spaces of authority,

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您可能不会认为那是您可以做的事情。而现在，只有一位黑人女性担任您的职位。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: you might not be able to think that's something that I can do. And it's only now that a black woman is in your position.

</details>

### DEI与多元化领导力

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 我们也生活在一个**DEI**（多元化、公平和包容）受到抵制，黑人社区（我还要补充，它们并非铁板一块）被推向政治口号的角落的时代，而您创造了历史。到目前为止，您的经历如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: We're also living at a time when there's a push back on **DEI** and when black communities, which I might also add are not monolithic. Yes. Um, black communities are being pushed into the corners of political slogans and you've made history. What has the experience been like for you so far?

</details>

**Zanab Abdraman**: 您知道，这是一次令人大开眼界但又非常激动人心的经历。我有机会参与许多不同的对话，并坐在一些传统上甚至没有足够女性、没有足够有色人种女性的会议桌旁。我认为重要的是要认识到，当您来自，您知道，我们所有人都有很多**交叉性**。我是黑人，我是女性，我是移民。我们为会议桌带来了许多不同的观点。我认为其他人，您不必和我一样，也能理解我了解被“他者化”的感觉，以及可能不被考虑的感觉。我认为这给许多不同的群体带来了很大的安慰。所以，这是一份我非常认真对待的经历。我认真对待我是第一位黑人女性主席这一事实。我真的抓住每一个机会强调，我也不希望我是最后一位。这不应该只是一次性的偶然事件。目标是真正敞开大门，以便我们继续看到这种**多样性**。我们应该能够看到任何属于这个会员资格的人都可以成为主席。这就是我们所生活的社会所代表的意义。所以，我希望我们能有越来越少的“第一和唯一”，而有更多的“是的，我们任何人都可以代表我们所有人”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zanab Abdraman**: You know, it's been an eyeopening but very exciting experience. You know, I do have the opportunity to be parts of lots of different conversations and to be at tables which, you know, traditionally we've not had even enough women, enough racialized women. And I think it's important to recognize that, you know, when you are from, you know, a lot of there's a lot of **intersectionality** for all of us. You know, I'm black, I'm a woman, you know, I'm immigrant. There's a lot of different views that we bring to the table. And I think others who may not, you don't have to be the same as me to for you to appreciate that I have an understanding of what it's like to be otherred, what it's like to maybe not be considered. And I think it gives a lot of comfort to a lot of different groups. And so it's been one that I've really taken seriously. I take the the fact that I am the first black woman president. And I really take it every opportunity to really emphasize that I don't want to be the last one either. This is not something that should just happen once as a blip. The goal is to actually to really open the doors so that we continue to see this **diversity**. we should be able to see anyone who is in the same in this membership to be the president. That's what it means, you know, to live in the society that we do. So, I'm hoping that we'll have less and less of the first and onlyies and more of the yes, any of us can represent all of us.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 嗯。我想稍后回到那个关于您在医疗保健领域所做的工作以及其重要性的对话，因为某些疾病以不同的方式影响着不同的群体。但我读到一篇关于您的文章，说您在一个“医学不仅仅是一种职业，而是一种生活方式”的家庭中长大。您为什么选择医疗保健事业？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Mhm. I want to come back to that conversation um in a little bit about you know uh what you're doing in healthcare and the importance because some conditions uh impact some groups different in different ways. Um but I read an article about you that said that you grew up in a household where quote medicine was not just a profession but a way of life. Why did you pursue a career in healthcare?

</details>

**Zanab Abdraman**: 您知道，我真的很喜欢人。我喜欢和人交谈。我的父亲现在是一名退休的**儿科医生**，所以我看到了他所做的一切。我真的很喜欢他整天都能和家人交谈。您知道，作为孩子，我也喜欢他的办公室里总是有孩子。但我真的很喜欢拥有一份能够成为人们生活一部分的职业。我也很喜欢科学、数学。这部分也吸引了我。我还有其他家庭成员也从事科学驱动的职业。我的一个表姐，她是一名**兽医**，尽管现在她更多地从事公共卫生领域的工作。但我记得小时候，我跟着她，她会带我去看一头牛分娩。我的意思是，这绝对让我排除了妇产科和兽医学校，但能在那里看到这一切真的很令人兴奋。所以，我认为我们的家人总是说，如果你对某件事感兴趣，就去看看。去思考它。没有真正的限制，而且非常受鼓励。我在青少年时期在我父亲的办公室工作，所有这些家庭都会说：“天哪，我生孩子的时候你爸爸就在那里。”当时非常害怕。然后他走过来，说：“你的宝宝很好。他们一忙完你，就会把你带到新生儿重症监护室。你会看到宝宝的。”他们谈到他多么令人安慰，以及有这样一张脸探过头来和他们说话是多么好。嗯，我当时就想：“哇，我真的很想有一天也能成为那样的人。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zanab Abdraman**: you know, um I really like people. I liked talking to people. Um my dad is now a retired **pediatrician** and so I got to see what he did. Um and I really just loved that he got to speak to families all day. You know, as a child, I also loved that there were always children in his office. Um but I really loved the thought of having a career in something where I got to be part of people's lives. I also really liked science, math. That part also drew me. I also had other family members who were also um in kind of science driven careers. One of my um first cousins, she's you know she's a **vet** um although now and then since then she also now works um more in like public health realm. But I remember even as a kid you know going with her and she would take me and say come see you know a cow being delivered. I mean, it definitely ruled out abstetrics and fetch school for me, but it was really exciting to be there and to see. So, I think that our families have always just kind of said, if you're interested in something, you know, go see it. You know, think about it. There was no real limitations, per se, and it was very much encouraged. And I worked in my dad's office as a teen and I'd have all these families say, "Oh my gosh, your dad was there when I was having my baby." And it was so scary. And then he came around. He said, "Your baby's fine. Soon as you know, they're done with you. They're going to bring you to the NICU. You'll see the baby." And they talked about how comforting he was and how it was so nice to have this face, you know, kind of peeking over to talk to them. Um, and I just thought, "Wow, that's I really want to I want to be that for someone one day."

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 所以，您从小就理解医生和患者之间的关系。这不仅仅是数字，而是非常亲密的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: So, from a young age, you understood the relationship between a doctor and their patients. It's not just numbers, but it's very intimate.

</details>

**Zanab Abdraman**: 是的。您有时会被带入人们生活中最私密的部分，有时可能是他们最糟糕的一天，您有能力弥合差距并安慰他们。您必须考虑到许多人可能是第一次见到医生。所以，我们能够在那一刻接触并陪伴他们，这真的很好。所以，这真的打动了我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zanab Abdraman**: It is. You you get brought into really the private parts of people's lives at sometimes it could be at the worst day for them, you know, um and you have that ability to bridge and to comfort them. And you have to consider many people may be meeting a physician for the very first time. So, it's really nice that we're able to kind of touch someone and be there for them in that moment. So, that really spoke to me.

</details>

### 医疗系统困境与医生福祉

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 嗯，那么您如何看待目前这个省份正在发生的情况呢？您亲身了解这个省份的医疗保健系统正承受着巨大的压力。急诊室和一些司法管辖区已经关闭。存在**家庭医生**危机。我看到新闻报道，当新的诊所开业时，人们会在寒冷的冬天排队数小时。医生们也正在努力获得他们的工作报酬。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Um, I wonder then how you see the situation that's happening in this province right now. Uh, you know, firsthand that the health care system in the province is strained. ERS and some jurisdictions are closed. There is a **family doctor** crisis. Um, I've watched the news and people would would line up for hours in the debt of winter when new clinics open. Doctors are also struggling to be paid for their work.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 在您的职位上，您为医生、这个省的居民以及医学生争取权益。对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: In your role, you act as an advocate for doctors, the residents of this province, and also medical students. Correct.

</details>

**Zanab Abdraman**: 是的，没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zanab Abdraman**: That's correct.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 那么您如何优先考虑这些群体之间截然不同的需求呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Um, how do you then prioritize the very different needs of those groups?

</details>

**Zanab Abdraman**: 是的，确实有很多变动的部分，但我认为有些问题是共通的。您知道，当我们谈论福祉时，我经常告诉人们，这归根结底是**福祉**。我所做的所有关于公平的工作，即使是为医生争取公平，最终也归结为每个人都应该拥有福祉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zanab Abdraman**: Yeah, there's a lot of definite moving parts, but I think some of the issues really go across, you know, when we're talking about um, you know, **wellness** really because I often tell people it really comes down to **wellness**. All the work that I'm doing in terms of equity even for phys for for physicians, it really comes to be that everyone deserve **wellness**.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您所说的**福祉**是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: What what is what does that what do you mean when you say **wellness**?

</details>

**Zanab Abdraman**: 这意味着您在工作时应该健康，在一个健康的环境中工作，在权力方面，他们应该为所提供的服务支付您适当的报酬，您应该知道自己能够处理所有的工作量，您应该知道系统也正在承担自己的工作，而您不必承担更多。所以对我来说，这真的是关于这一点，因此，向医学生展示这一点，让他们看到他们有一个前进的空间，他们选择了正确的道路，他们可以选择任何一条道路，所以对我来说，这一切都归结为福祉。我希望我们所有的医生、所有的住院医生、所有的医学生都能在他们工作的地方感到安全，并知道他们选择的职业仍然适合他们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zanab Abdraman**: It means that you know you deserve to be um healthy when you're working be in a healthy environment to work healthy in terms of the powers that be should pay you appropriately for services rendered you should know that you can handle all the amount of work you should know the system is also absorbing its own work and that you don't have to take on more. So for me it's really about that and so you know showing that to the medical students so that they see that they have a space moving forward that they've chosen the right path and they could choose any of the paths you know and so that for me it kind of all comes down to kind of **wellness**. I want our all the doctors all the residents all the medical students to feel safe where they work and know that there is their career their chosen career is still for them.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 那么省里的居民呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Um what about the residents in the province?

</details>

**Zanab Abdraman**: 所以，当您说居民时，我想澄清一下，您是指？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zanab Abdraman**: So in terms of so when you say residents I want to clarify you mean

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: **安大略省**居民，那些可以使用**OHIP**（**安大略省医疗保险计划**）的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: **Ontarians** the people who have access to **OHIP**.

</details>

**Zanab Abdraman**: 抱歉，当居民也是——

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zanab Abdraman**: Sorry when residents are also

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 我知道，我当时想等等，我最喜欢的节目之一叫《住院医生》。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: I know that's I was like wait one of my favorite show is called the resident.

</details>

**Zanab Abdraman**: 是的。我当时想我们是在谈论正在培训的住院医生吗？还是在谈论**安大略省**的人民？我只是想在回答这个问题之前确定一下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zanab Abdraman**: Yes. I was like are we talking about the residents in training? Are we talking about the people of **Ontario**? I just want to be sure before I answer this question.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 哦，天哪。我非常抱歉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry.

</details>

**Zanab Abdraman**: 居住在**安大略省**的人民。是的，因为这也就是我们真正为之努力的人。因为我知道，如果我们的医生无法在我们的医疗保健系统中维持和生存，我们的患者会怎样？您看到如此多的医生离开，他们说我真的无法再继续了。他们已经非常努力。他们几乎一直在与系统抗争，为他们的患者争取护理。我知道，如果那个人因为精疲力尽而提前离开，那实际上会影响到如此多的患者。我们看到如此多的人。所以，对于**安大略省**的人民来说，通过为他们的医生争取权益，为医疗保健系统争取权益，谁能比那些看到患者面临困难的医生更了解在医疗保健系统中就医有多难呢？因为我们看到了问题，我们看到了无法及时通过系统就医的后果，我们看到不幸的是，这确实以不同的方式影响着不同的人群。所以，为医生争取权益的工作，就是为**安大略省**人民争取权益。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zanab Abdraman**: The people that live in the province of **Ontario**. Yeah. because that's that's you know who we're also really doing this for because we I know that if if our doctors aren't you know able to sustain and survive in our health care system what happens to our patients? You see so many physicians going going and they're like I just can't go anymore. I've tried so hard. They've been fighting almost against the system to get care for their patients. And I know that if that person leaves early because they're burnt out that actually, you know, affects so many patients. We see so many people. So for the people of **Ontario** by advocating for their doctors, advocating for the health care system and who knows better about how hard it is to navigate the healthare system than those who are seeing the patients who are having those difficulties because we see the troubles and we see the results of not also being able to get through the system in a timely fashion and we see that unfortunately it does affect different populations in different ways. So that is, you know, to do the work to advocate for doctors is to advocate for the people of **Ontario**.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 人们现在常说我很幸运有**家庭医生**，生活在像**安大略省**这样世界上最富裕的司法管辖区之一，我们不应该说这样的话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Uh it's become a thing for people to say that I'm lucky to have a **family doctor** and living in a place like **Ontario**, one of the wealthiest jurisdictions in the world. It doesn't feel like we should be saying that.

</details>

**Zanab Abdraman**: 不，绝对不应该。因为不应该有赢家和输家，对吧？因为您知道，如果您说我很幸运，那意味着有人不幸运。有人没有。这确实很不幸，因为您说得对，我们是最大的省份，我们获得了相当可观的资金，但我们仍然面临这些问题。这也是全国范围内普遍存在的问题。我认为在医学规划方面缺乏远见。您知道，如果您回顾历史，如果您告诉您在90年代他们实际上削减了医学院的招生名额，您会感到惊讶。当时掌权者决定减少这些数字。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zanab Abdraman**: No, absolutely. Because it there shouldn't be winners and losers, right? Because you know, if you're saying I'm lucky, that means that there's someone who's unlucky. there's someone who doesn't have and it is it is unfortunate because you're right we're in the largest province we're you know quite significantly well funded but we're still having this issues it's also an issue that's reflected across the country and I think there has been some lack of foresight in terms of looking at medicine looking at planning in medicine you know if you look back in the history you know you'd be surprised if I told you in the '90s they actually cut down medical school spots the in power decided to decrease those numbers

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 因为他们认为人口不够多，或者？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: because they didn't population wasn't big enough or

</details>

**Zanab Abdraman**: 不，人口是够的，但他们觉得他们已经足够了。但这是一种缺乏远见，没有考虑到每一代人都会略有不同。我们将面临人口扩张。我们将面临移民。我们将面临出生率。有太多您需要预测的因素。我们花了大量时间预测加拿大运作的许多不同领域，但我认为没有足够的时间用于关注人口，而是从医生的角度来看待它，以及医生如何分担这种负担，并意识到我们实际上需要更多医生，而且护理方式也会随着时间而改变，我们将需要在不同领域有更多的医生，而且，您知道，开放所有不同的专业，有些专业默认很小，但我们仍然需要更多。是的，我们的人数减少了，但例如，我是一名**过敏症专科医生**。**加拿大**实际上没有那么多**过敏症专科医生**。我们大约有250人，可能接近300人，但这是在整个**加拿大**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zanab Abdraman**: No, the population was but it was you know they felt that it wasn't they they had enough that they could do but it's a lack of foresight and not thinking that each each generation is going to be slightly different. We're going to have expansions in population. We're going to have immigration. We're going to have birth rates. There's so many you have to forecast. We spent so much time forecasting about a lot of different areas in terms of just, you know, how Canada works, but I don't think there was enough of it spent looking at the population, but looking at it in terms of physicians and how physicians share this load and realizing that we need to actually have more and the styles of care also change over time and we're going to need more physicians in different areas and you know opening up all the different there's some specialties which are very small by default but realizing but we still need more of them. Yes, we've had less but for example I'm an **allergist**. We don't actually have that many **allergists** in **Canada**. There's about 250 of us maybe getting close to 300 but that's across **Canada**.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 如果您在纽约州北部，我想那里大约有250名**过敏症专科医生**。所以人数远远不够。您必须始终考虑到人口正在增加。我们有过敏症增加。我们有老龄化人口增加。所以，我们必须进行预测并增加以帮助支持这一点。退休的医生，那些执业40年的医生，他们的执业规模通常比新医生大，这需要时间才能感到舒适，才能建立起来，而且人口也变得更加复杂。所以某些患者现在需要更多的时间。所以您不会再看到那么大规模的执业了。所以您也必须将这一点考虑在内。所以正是由于缺乏考虑如此多不同的因素，才导致我们走到今天。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: And if you're in upstate New York I think there's about 250 **allergists** there. So there's not quite enough. And you have to always consider that the population is increasing. We have increasing allergies. We have increasing aging population. So, we have to be forecasting and increasing to help support that. And physicians who have retired, who have been in practice for 40 years, they often have larger practices than perhaps newer physicians, a it takes you time to feel comfortable, to set up, but also the population has become a lot more complicated and more complex. So certain patients just need more time now. So you're not going to see as large of the practices anymore. So you have to also factor that in. So it's the lack of factoring so many different factors that have kind of led us here.

### 医疗账单系统与女性健康数据缺失

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 《**Mistreated**》是一个关于女性健康的播客，我们从很多女性那里听到，她们需要很长时间才能见到**妇科医生**，甚至只是**神经外科医生**。我稍后会问您这个问题，但我只是想快速跟进一下。嗯，**安大略省**的医生和省政府最近达成了一项为期四年的新协议，其中包括为您的会员增加薪酬。尽管如此，一些医生发现由于**安大略省**的**账单系统**，他们很难获得报酬。**卫生部**和**OMA**提议采取什么措施来解决这个问题？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: **Mistreated** is a podcast on women's health and we're hearing from a lot of women who are saying that they're waiting for a long time to see a **gynecologist** or even just a neurosurgeon. I will ask you that in a in a moment, but I wanted to just do a quick followup. Um, **Ontario**'s doctors and the province recently reached a new 4-year deal that concludes compensation uh, increases for your members. That said, some doctors are finding it difficult to get paid due to **Ontario**'s **billing system**. What is the IM ministry and the **OMA** proposing to do to fix that?

</details>

**Zanab Abdraman**: 嗯，我们一直从**OMA**的角度谈论这个问题已经很长时间了，我们实际上在谈判中将其提交给了仲裁委员会，仲裁员已经表示，这很好，它已写入书面文件。它说我们必须找到解决这个问题的方法，如果未来几个月仍未解决，那么我们将回到仲裁委员会。您知道，我们提出了许多不同的解决方案。您知道，一些问题可能是针对复杂手术的，仅仅因为输入了太多代码，就会被标记，然后自动拒绝，要求您手动提供证据证明您确实进行了所有这些复杂手术，但阅读这些证明的人可能实际上没有临床经验，所以我不知道您是否读过手术记录，但即使对我这个领域的人来说，它们也非常复杂，更不用说不是每天都做手术的人了，所以我们要求他们让具有临床专业知识的人首先审查这些记录，以确定其是否适当。另一方面，例如，对于我们最脆弱的人群。如果您正在经历无家可归、精神健康问题或成瘾，验证您的健康卡非常困难，因为续卡所需的一项内容是地址。所以我们知道这些人住在**安大略省**。我们知道他们符合资格。我们知道他们需要护理，但他们的账单会不断被拒绝。但我们知道他们符合资格。所以，我们要求他们恢复一些**善意计费**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zanab Abdraman**: Well, we've been speaking from the **OMA** perspective. We've been speaking about this issue for quite a long time and we brought it actually to the arbitration board um in terms of our negotiations and the arbitrator has said which is great. It's in writing. It said that we must find ways to address this and if it's still not resolved in the next few months then we we do go back to the arbitration board. You know, we've come up with a lot of different solutions. you know um some some of the issues can be for complicated surgeries just by putting in so many codes that gets flagged and then it gets automatically rejected asking you to manually show proof that you did do all of this complicated surgery but the people who are reading it may actually not have clinical experience so I don't know if you ever read an O note but they're really complicated even for myself in the field but not someone who does surgeries day-to-day so we're asking for them to have people with clinical expert expertise being the first ones who are reviewing these notes to determine if it's appropriate. A flip side of that is for example any of our most vulnerable populations. If you're experiencing homelessness or mental health or addictions, it's really difficult to validate your health card because one of the things that's required to renew it is an address. And so we know these people live in **Ontario**. We know they're eligible. We know they need care and yet their those bills would be continually rejected. but we know that they are eligible for it. So, we're asking for them to bring back some of that **good faith billing**.

</details>

**Zanab Abdraman**: 嗯，正如我所说，我也是一名**儿科医生**。我最初两年在**儿科**工作。所以，当我们看到新生儿时，您知道，一旦有了宝宝，您相信大约有14到30天的时间去**安大略省服务中心**办理临时文件。没错。但这很困难。您几乎无法——

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zanab Abdraman**: Um, as I said, I'm also certified as a **pediatrician**. My first two years I did work in pediatrics. So, when we would see newborns, you know, once you have a baby, you have believe it's about, you know, 14 to 30 days to get to that service **Ontario** to get that temporary paper. Exactly. But it's difficult. You are barely

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 我做了剖腹产，所以我当时想，我不会——

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: I had a C-section, so I was like, I'm not

</details>

**Zanab Abdraman**: 没错。但随后，为新生儿提供护理的人的账单会被拒绝，因为他们也是按月处理的。所以通常到提交和处理时，那个临时号码已经过期了。您知道，有时我们遇到这样的情况，宝宝没有存活下来，然后**OHIP**会对我这样的人说，好吧，打电话给家人，让他们去**安大略省服务中心**注册。但这些家庭正在悲伤中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zanab Abdraman**: Exactly. But then that gets rejected for those who provided the newborn care because they also process it on a monthly basis. So usually by the time it's submitted and processed that temporary number has expired and you know sometimes we have it where you know the babies don't survive and then you know **OHIP** will say to someone like myself well just call the family and have them go to service **Ontario** and register. the families are grieving

</details>

**Zanab Abdraman**: 我说我只会打电话给他们，提供支持的话语，看看他们是否想谈谈，但我不会让他们去办理。所以，这有点像让您自行承担不付款的后果，因为在这种时候，没有人会去打扰一个家庭来办理这种事情。您应该知道他们已经去世的记录，所以它在同一个系统中。那么我们为什么需要让他们去那里呢？我们已经通过医院处理了所有这些信息。所有这些信息都是已知的。所以，就是这样的事情。仅仅延长任何婴儿的注册时间，给他们90天。这就是我们要求的，因为有时您只是很忙。这很困难。就像您说的，剖腹产后，有很多事情发生。调整，不睡觉。我认为给父母一些喘息的空间也是公平的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zanab Abdraman**: and I, you know, I say I'm only going to call them to offer, you know, words um of support and to see if they want to talk, but I will not be sending them. And so, it's kind of left to you to just absorb non-payment for that because no one in their right minds would go and bother a family at that time for something like this. You should know it's registered that they passed away, so it's in the same system. So, why do we need to have them go there? we've already processed all of that through the hospital. All that information is known. So, it's things like that. Just extending any baby, giving them 90 days. That's what we're asking for because sometimes it's just you're just busy. It's difficult. Like you said, after a C-section, there's a lot of things happening. Adjusting, not sleeping. Give parents also a little bit of wiggle room, I think, is also fair.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 嗯，现在**妇科**方面的数据匮乏，以及看**妇科医生**的候诊时间。女性正在离开本省和本国寻求护理。需要做些什么来改变这种状况，并优先考虑**妇科**护理？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Um, right now there's a lack of data around **gynecology** and the way times for seeing a **gynecologist**. women are leaving the province and the country to access care. What needs to be done to change this to also prioritize gynec **gynecological care**?

</details>

**Zanab Abdraman**: 我认为首先，当您遇到问题时，您必须真正地审视它。您必须真正地衡量它。有如此多的数据被收集，关于膝关节手术的等待时间、髋关节手术的等待时间、眼科手术的等待时间。重要的是我们也要提升一些这些问题，就等待时间而言。我的意思是，您知道，我知道我们在您的播客中谈论了很多关于**子宫肌瘤**的问题，这是一个影响如此多女性的问题。那么，我们为什么不将**子宫肌瘤手术**的等待时间作为其中一个指标呢？或者仅仅是获得**妇科**服务的等待时间，因为不幸的是，这比人们通常认为的要长得多，有时很难找到做某些类型手术的人。所以也要看看这一点，您知道，他们经常会说：“我们没有数据支持这一点。”好吧，如果您不衡量某件事，您也就不知道它。我认为这是**公平性问题**的反映。我认为这在疫情高峰期也出现了，当时我们试图证明，黑人患病和死亡的比例过高。他们说：“好吧，您真的知道吗？”我们说他们说：“好吧，您没有收集基于种族的数据，但我们可以告诉您，如果您查看某些地区，我们已经看到了这种情况，我们已经看到了邮政编码。”如果您不寻找某件事，您就无法解决问题。我认为我们需要做的就是更多地关注那些不成比例地影响女性或只影响女性的问题的获取，而我们还没有让这些问题受到关注。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zanab Abdraman**: I think firstly, you know, when you have an issue, you have to actually look at it. You have to actually measure it. There's so much data um that's being collected about time to, you know, knee surgery, time to hip surgery, time to eye surgery. It's important that we also elevate some of these issues in terms of time to I mean, you know, I know we've talked a lot on your podcast about um **fibroids** and that is an issue that affects so many women. So, why don't we look at time to **fibroid surgery** as one of the other ones or just even time to access to **gynecology** because unfortunately that is much longer than um people often think it is and sometimes it's very difficult to get people who do certain types of surgeries. So also looking at that, you know, often they'll say, "We don't have the data supporting this." Well, if you're not measuring something, you also don't know about it. And I think it's a reflection of the **equity issue**. I think this came up also during peak pandemic times when we were trying to prove to show that, you know, we were having disproportionate deaths and illnesses in black people. And they said, "Well, do you really know that?" and we said they said well you haven't been collecting **race-based data** but we can tell you if you're looking at certain um regions we've seen this and we've seen the postal codes we've seen and if you don't look for something you can't address an issue and I think that's one of the things we need to have is more looking at access to issues that disproportionately affect women or only affect women and we haven't had this light being shone on

</details>

### 系统性偏见与信任危机

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 嗯，我认为疫情以许多不同的方式改变了我们，医生们站在前线。嗯，我无法想象你们在过去几年里所承受的压力，而我则在应对自己的健康问题。我真的很惊讶地发现，我们甚至没有追踪**妇科**护理的等待时间。所以，如果您不追踪它，就像您说的，如果您没有数据，嗯，您如何改变它？我们不追踪影响50%人口的疾病，这让我感到震惊。这难道不是**偏见**吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: um I think the the pandemic shifted us in so many different ways and doctors at the front line. Um I I can't imagine the weight that you all felt over the past few uh years while I navigated my own health problems. I was really surprised to find out that we don't even track uh weight times for **gynecology care**. So if you don't track it, like you said, if you don't have the data, um how can you change it? And it blows my mind that we don't track conditions that impact 50% of its population. How is that anything but **bias**?

</details>

**Zanab Abdraman**: 不是。它就是**偏见**，对吧？这就是为什么我经常告诉人们，改变我们的**领导结构**非常重要，因为这是您开始决定您关注什么的时候。如果您不考虑它，如果它没有在决定我们关注什么的会议桌上讨论，那么这些观点就不会传达给普通人。所以不幸的是，过去许多领导层会议桌主要是白人和男性，他们没有思考或谈论具体的**女性健康问题**，谈论像**子宫肌瘤**这样的事情，谈论甚至**更年期**。我可以告诉您，我们现在更多地谈论**更年期**。我可以告诉您，在医学院里，我对**更年期**的教育非常少。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zanab Abdraman**: It's not. It It is **bias**, right? And that's, you know, why I often tell people, it's really important for us to change our **leadership structures** because this is when you start to determine what you look at. If you're not thinking about it, if it's not discussed at the tables that determine what we're looking at, you're not going to have those views kind of coming down to the general person. And so unfortunately when tables have been predominant a lot of the leadership tables in the past have been predominantly white and male um they have not been thinking or talking about specifically **women's health issues** talking about things like **fibroids** talking about you know even **menopause**. I can tell you we're talking a lot more about **menopause**. I can tell you in medical school I had very little education on **menopause**.

</details>

**Zanab Abdraman**: 您知道，我想我们有一两天在课堂上简要地谈论过它，然后在我妇产科轮岗期间，我们花了一些时间在这上面，那是因为我轮岗的一个人对此很感兴趣，所以她花时间谈论它，我们有教学课程，但这不一定也包含在课程中。所以这是一个问题。我们还需要改变我们如何教授某些疾病，因为您知道，我想说作为**家庭医生**，对于从事**家庭医学**的人来说，他们经常看到这种情况，所以我们还需要培训人们能够识别，能够进行相关对话，也能够谈论那些“没关系”的事情。您知道，就我个人而言，所有那些经期量大、然后有痛经的时候，每个人都说那只是生活的一部分。那是会发生的事情。我们真的应该说——

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zanab Abdraman**: you know, I think there was a day or two where we talked about it briefly um in the classes and then on my um abstetrics and gynecology rotation um we spent a bit of time on it but that was because one of the people where I did my rotation that was an interest of hers and so she spent time speaking on it and we had teaching sessions on it but that's not necessarily built into the curriculum as well. So this is an issue. We also need to change how we're teaching about certain conditions because you know I would say as a **family doctor** for people who are in **family medicine** they are seeing this a lot and so we need to also train people to be able to identify to be able to have conversations about it to also talk about things that are okay to not be okay. you know, um, personally for myself, you know, all the times of having heavy periods, then having cramps, everyone just said that's just part of life. That's something that happens. And we should really have probably said

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 那不正常。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: that's not normal.

</details>

**Zanab Abdraman**: 那不正常。我们不应该接受这成为常态，即一半人口持续处于疼痛中，而且，并不是每个人都有这种情况，但有些人——

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zanab Abdraman**: That's not normal. this and we shouldn't have accepted this to be the norm that it's just okay for half of the population to constantly be in pain and you know not and the thing is not everybody has that but to just some people

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 有些人有，但只是说这可能会发生，没有进一步的讨论。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: some people have it and just to say this can just happen and no further discussion

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 我仍然停留在“一两天”上，我只是想，天哪，这解释了很多，因为我认为许多女性正在经历的情况是，她们感到沮丧，因为她们去看医生，尽管医生可能出于好意，但他们没有那些信息。所以，您上网，然后试图弄清楚自己到底出了什么问题？比如，我从网上读到的信息中意识到**子宫肌瘤**是严重的。嗯，我们还在这个播客中听到女性被拒绝获得省外护理。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: I'm still stuck on a day or two I'm just like what oh my gosh um it explains a lot because I think what's happening for a lot of women you get frustrated because you go to doctor and as well-meaning as they can be, they don't have that information. So, you go online and then you try to figure out like what is wrong with me? Like, I realized **fibroids** were serious from the information I read online. Um, we've also heard from women on this podcast about them being denied access to out of province care.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 他们已经完成了所有步骤，有外科医生的信件，患有这些主要影响女性的非常罕见的疾病。嗯，然后他们通过繁文缛节被拒绝了护理，然后他们的生活就变成了为自己争取权益的生活，而他们的生活质量却不断下降。**OMA**在帮助这些患者方面的立场是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: They've gone through all the steps, have the letters from the surgeon, have these very rare conditions that impact mostly women. Um and then they're through red tape they are denied that care and then their life is just a life of trying to advocate for themselves while the quality of care for their life just goes down. What is the **OMA**'s position on helping these patients?

</details>

**Zanab Abdraman**: 您知道，我们的立场是真正支持我们的患者，我们希望减少繁文缛节，因为您知道，很多时候，就像您说的，他们有医生所有的信件，他们的医生正在为他们争取权益，您知道，我们知道我们的医疗保健系统中有哪些可用的，通常情况下，在**安大略省**的医疗保健系统中，我们可以在很多方面获得护理，但有时当我们说本省没有这种护理时，您知道，您提供了所有这些信息。这太令人沮丧了，您感到无助，因为您说我写了信，并且您继续尝试。所以我们真的相信您应该听取医疗保健系统中的那些人的意见。如果我们写信说**安大略省**没有这种护理。我们需要在其他地方获得护理，或者我们需要在其他地方获得手术护理，或者获得某些药物。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zanab Abdraman**: You know, our position is really to support our physi sorry support our patients and we want there to be less red tape this part because you know a lot of times like as you said they have all the letters from their physicians their physicians are advocating for them you know we know kind of what's available in our healthare system and often yes a lot of times within our healthare system in **Ontario** we can get care for a lot of aspects but sometimes when we say we don't have this in the province you know and you've provided I did all this information. It's so frustrating and you're helpless because you said I've written the letter and you continue to try. So really believe that you should listen to those in the health care system. If we've written we've said we can't this is not available in **Ontario**. We need care elsewhere or we need to get either surgical care elsewhere or get certain medications.

</details>

**Zanab Abdraman**: 当它不被批准时，真是太令人沮丧了。我们真的希望有更容易的方法来解决其中一些问题。很多时候，它们是罕见的疾病，但有时它们并不那么罕见，但我们只是无法在省内获得。我们必须能够以公平的方式解决这个问题，因为对于一些人来说，他们会说：“我甚至不知道你可以继续要求，或者有其他方法可以解决。”我们必须公平地对待，有些人有能力选择在其他地方私下做一些事情，而另一些人则没有。所以那些没有能力的人将遭受更多痛苦，所以我们真的需要这是一个可以通过公平程序轻松解决的问题，让您了解规则。有时感觉您不知道获得某种东西的规则是什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zanab Abdraman**: And when it's just not approved, it's so frustrating. And we really want there to be easier ways to navigate through some of these. And for a lot of sometimes they're rare conditions, but sometimes they're not so rare, but we just don't have access within. And we have to be able to navigate this in a fair fashion because for some people they'll say, "I didn't even know you could continue to ask or there were other ways to get around." And we have to be fair that some people have the means to just opt to do something privately elsewhere and others do not. So those who have not are going to suffer more and so we really need this to be something that can be easily navigated in a fair process where you understand the rules. Sometimes it feels like you don't know what the rules are to get something across.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您是否担心这会在患者和医护人员之间产生连锁反应？因为我认为根据我自己的经验以及我与人交谈的经验，这会造成信任的缺失，然后当发生像麻疹这样的事情时，您会说，我不再信任医生或医疗保健系统了，因为当我需要护理时，没有人关心我。您是否担心这会产生连锁反应，影响我们所有人？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: uh do you worry about the ripple effect that can create between patients and um healthcare workers because I think from my own experience and from the people that I've spoken to it creates this lack of trust and then when something happens like around measles you're like well I don't trust the doctor or the health care system because when I needed care no one cared for me do you worry about like that create because it just feels like it's creat creating a ripple effect into many different areas that impact all of us.

</details>

**Zanab Abdraman**: 我确实担心这种影响。我非常担心，因为就像您说的。有时，当您无法为某人提供他们真正需要的东西时，他们会非常失望。他们会想，如果您做不到，您是否足够努力了？或者，这被视为一种失败，您情不自禁地将所有人，医疗保健系统、医生、护士，都归入其中，这真的很不幸，因为这是系统的失败，但人们仍然为您争取权益，并支持您。但您说得对，同时，有些人也曾遇到过难以获得医生支持的情况，因为医生可能对此不太了解。他们不认识到某些群体比其他群体面临更大的风险。所以这确实导致了信任的这种变化，以至于当发生像麻疹爆发这样的事情时，您知道，当我们做这项工作时，疫情就是一个很好的例子，因为那是一个每个人都非常关注的时期，您知道，当我们谈论为黑人人口提供疫苗时，因为我们看到疾病影响不成比例，您知道，很多人说好吧，我们去吧，我们动员起来，我们当时说等等等等，您怎么能不思考一下，可能存在一些历史因素，您不能就这样带着大规模的疫苗接种运动闯入，而不认识到那里存在的一些信任问题。所以您也必须保持一定程度的谦逊，说您知道，我们确实有过失败的时候，那时我们成立了**黑人科学家疫苗公平工作组**，我们专注于此，我们说让我们谈谈医疗保健系统具体未能帮助黑人的时候，让我们对此开诚布公，这就是为什么我们所有不同方面的黑人聚集在一起，您知道，我自己做了很多关于疫苗过敏的工作，其他人做了疫苗开发。其他人做了，您知道，许多不同的领域，以期聚集在一起说我们来这里谈论这个问题，因为我们意识到以前存在错误。所以，您也必须能够说过去我们确实犯了一些错误，并以谦逊的态度解决它，但也带着知识。您也必须欣赏过去发生的事情。这就是为什么我一直对“**反疫苗者**”这个词有意见。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zanab Abdraman**: I do worry about that impact. I worry a lot about it because exact it's exactly what you said. Sometimes, you know, when I can't get someone something that they really do need, they look they're so disappointed. They're like if you can't do this, you know, um how have you tried hard enough or you know, it's a it's seen as a failure and you can't help but obviously look at the you put everybody in that, you know, the health care system, the physicians, the nurses, you kind of put everybody there and it's really unfortunate because it's a failure of the system, but people still advocated for you and were in your corner. But you're right, at the same time, some people also have had difficulties with getting the buyin sometimes from their physicians as well because maybe they're not as versed on this. They don't recognize that certain groups are at more risk than others. And so that does lead to this kind of changing shifts with trust so that when things like this happen like the measles outbreak you know when we did the work um the pandemic is just a great example because it's a great time when everyone was really focused you know when we were talking about bringing vaccines to you know the black population because we were seeing that disproportionate um disease impact you know a lot of people said okay let's go let's mobilize and we were like whoa whoa whoa you cannot How can you not think for a second that there might be some historical aspects that you can't just go barging in with this huge vaccine campaign and without recognizing some of the issues with trust there. So you also have to be there has to be a level of humility with it to say you know what there were times when we did fail and that's when we did the **black scientist task force on vaccine equity** for co we went in focused on that we said let's talk about the times when the healthcare system specifically failed black people let's be open about that and that's why we all got together as different as black people in different aspects of you know myself I did a lot of work on vaccine allergy other people vaccine development. Other people did, you know, um a lot of different areas to kind of bring together and say we're bringing here to talk about this because we realize there were previous wrongs. So, you have to also be able to say in the past we have had some wrongs and address it with humility, but also with the knowledge. You have to also appreciate what has happened in the past. That's why I always had a problem with the term **antivaxer**

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 因为这听起来像是贬义词。因为有些社区可能对疫苗犹豫不决是有原因的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: because it just sounds like it's it's derogatory because there are reasons some communities might be vaccine hesitant.

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 嗯，所以我认为语言非常重要。嗯，我们的省级领导人现在应该关注什么，考虑到这个省正在发生的一切？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: Um and so I think language is very important. Um what should our provincial leaders be focused on right now with the bigger picture of what's happening in this province?

</details>

### 改进医疗系统与数据收集

**Zanab Abdraman**: 我认为现在放眼全局，我们真的需要专注于确保每个**安大略省**居民都能拥有**家庭医生**。为什么？因为那是您建立一对一信任关系的地方，随着时间的推移，您会了解他们，这样您就可以进行这些对话，讨论您是否对任何疫苗或任何治疗犹豫不决。您需要能够建立信任，而这确实发生在与您长期建立关系的人进行的小对话中。所以，我们确实需要关注这一点。我们还需要关注确保有足够的**专科医生**，以便当患者需要看他们时，他们是可用的，并且我们不会在系统中看到如此巨大的等待时间。我们需要医疗保健系统和政府也提供支持，并允许医疗保健系统中不同人员之间的这种沟通。我认为对我们所有人真正有帮助的一件事是，如果我们全省拥有更好的**数字健康基础设施**，这样信息就可以更容易地流动。您知道，如果有人需要转诊某人，例如，您的**家庭医生**转诊给一个人。如果他们不可用或那不是他们的领域，他们就会拒绝。他们必须找其他人。您不断地寻找，却没有一个地方可以查看所有人，看看他们不同的超专业化领域是什么。如果我们有一个像**中央转诊途径**这样的系统，您的医生只需输入这是问题，具体来说我的患者愿意出行50、100、150公里，每个人对出行距离的开放程度不同，然后说这就是我正在寻找的，让系统来做这件事，然后让医生回去花时间陪伴他们的患者。令人惊讶的是我们还没有这个系统。但话又说回来，作为父母，我仍然有那些黄色的疫苗卡，就像，为什么这不在一个系统里？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zanab Abdraman**: I think right now looking across, you know, we really need to focus on ensuring that we can get I think every **Ontarian** a **family doctor**. Why? Because that's where you build trust with these one-on-one relationships where you get to know them over time so that you can have these conversations where you can talk about if you're hesitant about any kind of a vaccine or any kinds of treatments. You need to be able to build trust and it does happen in small conversations with someone that you have built, you know, relationships with over time. So, we do need to focus on that. We also need to focus on making sure there's enough of the **consultant specialists** in the pool so that when patients do need to see them, they're available and we're not seeing this huge weights in our system. We need the health care system and the government to also provide to allow for this and to allow for this communication across the different people in the health care system. I think one of the things that would really help I think for all of us would be if we had better **digital health infrastructure** across the province so it's easier to move information. You know, if someone needs to refer someone, for example, you know, your **family doctor** refers to one person. If they're not available or that's not their field, they decline it. They have to find someone else. And you keep going and there's no one place to go look at everybody and see what their different areas are of like hyper specialization. If we just had a system like a **central referral pathway** where your doctor just has to put in this is the issue specifically my patient is willing to travel 50 100 150 km everyone has different open to traveling so far and saying this is what I'm looking for and let the system do that and then let the doctor go back and spend time with their patient. surprising that we don't have that yet. But then again, as a parent, I still have those yellow cards for vaccines where it's like, why isn't this um in a system?

</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 您之前谈到数据以及收集数据的重要性。最近，**黑人女性健康研究所**（**Black Women's Institute for Health**）发布了**加拿大**首份此类报告，即**加拿大黑人妇女和女孩全国健康调查**，报告名为《**未被听到的声音**》（**Unheard Voices**），它审视了黑人女性如何体验医疗保健系统以及她们如何被对待。您认为拥有这样的报告为什么很重要？

**Nam Kiwanuka**: You were talking before about data and the importance of collecting data. Recently, the **Black Women's Institute for Health**, released the first of its kind, **Canada**'s first **National Health Survey of Black Women and Girls**, the report is called **Unheard Voices**, and it looked at how black women experience the health care system and how they're treated. Why do you think it's important to have reports like this?

**Zanab Abdraman**: 这很重要，因为最终我们仍然需要数据，尽管我们有大量数据，但这似乎对许多人来说是一个显而易见的真理，但最终我们仍然需要展示这些数据，并将其提供给各级政府。您知道，就像我说的，如果您不衡量某件事，您就可以说我们不知道这是一个问题，那么现在您就不能再不知道了。所以，所有这些信息在各个层面共享非常重要。因为医疗保健，是的，由省提供，联邦拨款，但最终，各级政府都在这里发挥作用，因为当您审视健康时，除了看医生、看护士、看所有不同类型的医疗服务提供者之外，还有许多方面。实际上，健康的最大决定因素是住房，健康的最大决定因素是拥有社区的这一方面。您知道，我们的心理健康需要社区，这是一个需要深思熟虑的巨大问题。所以我们需要社会服务部门也听到这些。所以我们需要这样的数据，以便当我们站出来说看看不同的人群，具体看看**加拿大**的黑人妇女和女孩，看看她们如何受到医疗保健系统和社会服务的负面影响时，您不能再说我们不知道，这不再是可接受的。所以这非常重要，对于任何未来的倡导都非常重要，并且需要继续进行。所以我们已经表明您可以做到，所以我们希望它会继续进行。

**Zanab Abdraman**: It's important because in the end we still need data even though we have ample amounts of it it seems like an obvious truth for so many in the end we still need to show this data and to provide it and for it to be available to all levels of government you know like I said if you don't measure something you can say we didn't know it was a problem well now you can't unknow this so it's important for all this kind of information to get shared at every level Because health care, yes, proincially provided, federal transfers, but in the end, every level of government does play a role here because when you look at health, there's many aspects more than just seeing your doctor, seeing um the nurses, seeing all different kind of um health providers. It actually biggest determinant of health, housing, biggest determinant of health is actually having that aspect of community. you know our mental health we require community and that is a huge thing to think about. So we need social services to also hear about this. So we need data like this so that when we come out and we say look at different populations look at specifically black women and girls in **Canada** and look at how adversely affected they are by the health care system by our social services you cannot say we didn't know that's no longer acceptable. So this is so important, so important for any advocacy moving forward and for it to continue to be done. So we've shown that you can do it and so we hope it'll continue to be done.

**Nam Kiwanuka**: **Zanab**，和您交谈真是非常愉快。直呼您的名字感觉有点奇怪，但还有什么您想补充而我遗漏的吗？

**Nam Kiwanuka**: It's been an absolute pleasure speaking to you, **Zav**. It feels weird calling you by your first name, but uh is there anything that you'd like to add that I missed?

**Zanab Abdraman**: 我想我只想对您说声谢谢。我认为您在这个播客中所做的一切，正在突出医疗保健系统中的许多问题。我们仍然存在差异。特别是当我们审视性别，然后当您将**交叉性**融入其中时，这种差异会变得越来越大，所以，您知道，这也为许多此类信息的传播提供了一个平台。所以谢谢您。您也在这方面提供了帮助。

**Zanab Abdraman**: I think that I just want to say thank you to you. I think that so much of what you've been doing on this podcast is highlighting so many of the issues within the health care system. We still have disparities. We especially when we look at gender and then when you lay in **intersectionality** into that that kind of becomes wider and wider and so you know this this also provides a platform for a lot of this information to get out there. So thank you. You're also helping in terms of this. So

### 卫生部回应

**Nam Kiwanuka**: 在我们采访**Zanab Abdul Ramen**医生后，我们联系了**安大略省卫生部**征求意见。以下是部分回应：**安大略省**的**医疗索赔支付系统**（**MCPS**）每年高效处理超过2亿份索赔。明确地说，其中超过99%的索赔是自动支付的，与提交内容完全一致，这反映了系统的生产力。只有一小部分，即所有索赔的0.58%，会被送去人工审查。即使在这些索赔中，超过95%的索赔在30天内得到解决。更细致的案件会提交给医疗顾问，即医生进行最终审查。结果包括全额支付、部分支付或退回给提供者，医生可以提供额外信息进行上诉。最终令人失望的是，**OMA**选择关注**OHIP**索赔的0.58%，而不是突出我们共同为支持医生所取得的真正进展。我们感谢**卫生部**新闻秘书的回应，完整的回复我们将发布在我们的元数据中。

**Nam Kiwanuka**: We reached out to **Ontario**'s **Ministry of Health** for comment following our interview with **Dr. Zanab Abdul Ramen**. Here is some of the response. **Ontario**'s **medical claims payment system** (**MCPS**), efficiently processed more than 200 million claims annually. To be clear, over 99% of these claims are paid automatically, exactly as submitted, reflecting the systems productivity. Only a small fraction, 0.58% of all claims are sent for manual review. And even among these, more than 95% are resolved within 30 days. More nuanced cases go to a medical adviser, a physician for final review. Outcomes include full payment, partial payment, or return to the provider, and physicians can appeal with additional information. It's ultimately disappointing that the **OMA** is choosing to focus on 0.58% of **OHIP** claims rather than highlighting the real progress we've made together to support physicians. Our thanks to the **Ministry of Health** press secretary for getting back to us and to read the full response we'll post in our metadata.
