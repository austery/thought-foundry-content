### 睡眠医生最常被问的问题

**Steven Bartlett**: 作为一名睡眠医生，人们来找您咨询的最常见问题是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: What are the most popular questions people come to you with as a sleep doctor?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 有三大类。第一是：“如果我睡着了，然后半夜醒来，就再也睡不着了，我该怎么办？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: There's three biggies. Number one is, "What do I do if I fall asleep, okay, and I wake up in the middle of the night and I can't fall back asleep?"

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 您能帮人们解决这个问题吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And you can help people with that.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 当然。第二个问题是：“我应该买什么样的枕头？”我将向您详细介绍哪种枕头适合哪种人。然后，人们经常问我的另一个问题是：“什么时候是做爱的最佳时间？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Absolutely. The second question is, "What pillow should I buy?" And I'm going to walk you through which pillows make sense for which people. And then another one that people ask me all the time is, "What's the best time to have sex?"

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 对于您这个职业的人来说，这真是个奇怪的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: That's a strange thing for somebody of your profession to be

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 让我解释一下原因。我作为一名**睡眠专家**已经积极执业了26年。我处理人们的睡眠问题，比如**睡眠呼吸暂停**和**失眠**。我真正感兴趣的是，您现在可能正在做的一些容易纠正的、会扰乱您睡眠的事情。例如，大多数人不知道他们体内有一种叫做**睡眠类型**的基因睡眠编码，它决定了您的大脑何时释放**褪黑素**、**皮质醇**、**肾上腺素**和**多巴胺**等物质。因此，我可以根据您的**睡眠类型**告诉您何时该睡觉，以及一天中进行几乎所有活动的最佳时间，包括喝咖啡和饮酒的最佳时间。这很神奇。甚至有数据表明，当您更符合自己的**睡眠类型**时，理解复杂概念的能力会提高。目前有三种已知的**睡眠类型**，但我出名是因为发现了第四种，我认为那可能就是您。所以，我们会详细讨论这一点。我们还会谈论梦境，因为梦境可以告诉您一些您可能不想知道的关于您自己的事情。然后还有如何解决**时差**、是否应该开着电视睡觉、**褪黑素**补充剂的真相，以及我最喜欢的获取**镁**的方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: about. Well, let me explain why. So, I've been an actively practicing sleep specialist for 26 years. I take care of people's sleep problems like apnea, insomnia, and I'm really interested in the things that you might be doing right now that are messing up your sleep that are easy to fix. So, for example, most people don't know that they have a genetic sleep code inside them called their chronoype, which decides when your brain releases things like melatonin, cortisol, adrenaline, and dopamine. And so I can show you based on your chronotype when it's bedtime, but also the perfect time of day to do almost any activity, including the perfect time to have coffee and alcohol. Crazy. There's even data to show that your ability to understand complicated concepts improves when you're more in line with your chronoype. Now, there are three known chronotypes, but what I'm famous for is discovering a fourth one, which I think might be you. So, we're going to talk a lot about that. We're also going to talk about dreams because dreams can tell you things about yourself that you may not want to know. And then there's how to fix jet lag, whether you should sleep with a TV on, the truth about melatonin supplementation, and my favorite way to get magnesium.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 在我们深入探讨所有这些之前，我们先去看看最佳的睡姿好吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Before we get into all of that, shall we go and look at the best possible sleep position?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 好的，我们去看看。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Yeah, let's check it out.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: **布鲁斯博士**，您是做什么的？为什么现在它如此重要？您对您所做的事情采取了什么不同寻常的视角，与我可能与其他人谈论这个话题时不同？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Dr. Bruce, yes. What is it you do? Why does it matter so much now? And what perspective do you take on what you do that is atypical versus other people I might have spoken to about this subject?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 我是一名**睡眠医生**。我治疗人们的睡眠问题，比如**睡眠呼吸暂停**、嗜睡症、**失眠**等等。我职业生涯的很大一部分不仅致力于理解如何治疗这些睡眠障碍，还致力于我所说的“紊乱的睡眠”。我非常关注行为习惯。正在发生什么？您现在可能正在做哪些容易纠正的、会扰乱您睡眠的事情？并且能够改变未来的情况。说实话，我一开始并没有想过要成为一名**睡眠医生**。那不在我的计划中。我当时正朝着一个完全不同的方向发展。我真正发现的一件事是，当您改变一个人的睡眠时，您就改变了他们的生活。它对他们的本质至关重要。作为一名睡眠教育者，以一种实用的方式、形式和形态，让人们能够从我所说的内容中获得并立即应用，这对我来说很重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: I'm a sleep doctor. I take care of people's sleep problems like apnea, narcolepsy, insomnia, things like that. I've dedicated a good portion of my career not just to understanding how to treat those disorders which are sleep disorders, but what I also I call disordered sleep. I'm really interested in behavioral habits. What's going on? what are the things that you might be doing right now that are kind of messing up your sleep that are easy to fix and be able to maybe change how things are going forward? You know, I I didn't start out thinking I was going to become a sleep doctor if I'm going to be honest with you. Like that that was not on the on the path. I was actually going in a completely different direction. And one of the things I really discovered was when you change someone's sleep, dude, you change their life. Like it is fundamental to who they are. And it's important for me to be a sleep educator in a way, shape, and form that's practical so that people can actually get something from what I'm talking about and apply it right then and there.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 可能会有数百万人点击这个对话来收听。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And there's probably a couple of million people that have clicked onto this conversation to listen.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Yeah.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 这个对话是为谁准备的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Who is this conversation for?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 我认为它是为所有对睡眠感到好奇、想改善睡眠，或者怀疑自己可能有睡眠问题的人准备的。我认为这三种人中的任何一种都会在这里找到巨大的价值。今天我们能为这些人具体做些什么呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: I think it's for anybody out there who's either curious about sleep or wants to try to improve their sleep or maybe suspicious that they could have a problem with their sleep. I think any one of those three types of people would find tremendous value here. And what are we going to be able to do for those people today specifically?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 所以，我将给人们提供几种不同的计划，如果可以这么说的话，甚至可能是一个五步计划，教他们如何绝对做到这些事情。他们还将了解体内的一种**基因睡眠编码**，叫做**睡眠类型**。很多人甚至不知道自己有**睡眠类型**，或者可能听说过这个概念，但从未听说过这个术语。我们将详细了解这一点。我们还会稍微谈谈梦境。我很高兴有机会这样做。我过去一年半的时间都在学习如何在我的临床工作中作为一名心理学家来利用梦境，这非常有趣。所以，我很高兴能分享一些。我认为人们会学到很多东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: So, I'm going to give people several different like plans, if you will, maybe even a five-step plan of things that they can absolutely learn how to do. They're also going to learn about a genetic sleep code that they have inside them called their chronoype. A lot of people don't even know that they have a chronoype or maybe they've heard of the of the idea, but they haven't ever heard of the term. We're going to learn a lot about that. We're also going to talk about dreams a little bit. I'm excited to have the opportunity to do that. I've spent the last year and a half learning more about how to use dreams in my clinical work as a psychologist, which is very interesting stuff. So, I'm excited to share some of that. So, I think people are going to learn a whole bunch.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 梦境很重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And dreams matter.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 哦，是的。它们绝对重要。我称梦境为**情绪代谢**。那么，当您做梦时，功能是什么？目的是什么？您在做什么？您实际上正在处理白天经历的**情绪状态**。这就是为什么我们会做噩梦，对吧？在噩梦中，场景很可怕，突然变得如此情绪化，您就醒了。这正式被称为噩梦。那种醒来，但您停止了处理。当您再次入睡时，您又回到了梦境，到达那个可怕的点，您又醒了，陷入了这个循环，对吧？所以梦境很重要，因为它们可能极具破坏性。此外，它们可以告诉您一些您可能不想知道，或者不总是放在心上的关于您自己的事情。对吧？有时人们会做一些非常有趣的梦，比如被追逐的梦，或者牙齿掉落的梦，或者所有这些不同的事情，它们可能意味着各种各样的事情。但我想非常清楚。没有一本指导手册会说：“嘿，如果您梦到自己在水里，您就恨您的母亲。”它不是那样运作的。梦境对做梦者有意义。所以目标是理解其中的背景。那么，做梦者是谁？梦境是什么？然后这两者如何协同作用？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Oh, yeah. They absolutely matter. I'm I call dreams emotional metabolism, right? And so, when you're dreaming, what is you what is the function? What is the purpose? What are you doing? You're actually working through your emotional states that you had during the daytime. this is why we have nightmares, right? And so in a nightmare, it's a scary scene and all a sudden it gets so emotional, you wake up. That is officially called a nightmare. That awakening, but you stop processing. And when you go back to sleep, you go back to the dream and you get to that scary point, you wake up again and you get caught in this loop, right? And so dreams matter because they can be incredibly disruptive. Also, they can tell you things about yourself that you may not want to know or may not have in the front of your mind at all times. Right? Sometimes people have very interesting dreams like dreams of being chased or dreams of their teeth falling out or all these different things and they can mean a whole host of different things. But I want to be super clear. There's no guide book that says, "Hey, you know, if you're if you're dreaming of that you're in water, you hate your mother." Like, it doesn't really work that way. Dreams mean something to the dreamer. And so the goal is to understand the context within that. So who is the dreamer? What is the dream? And then how do those two work together?

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 您从学术和专业上汲取了哪些经验？请告诉我您合作过多少人，以及人们来找您咨询的问题范围。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And what is the experience that you're drawing from academically but also professionally? Give me a view of how many people you've worked with and the range of things people come to you with.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是的。我作为一名**睡眠专家**积极执业了26年。我在医生的诊室工作，因为我不是医学博士。我拥有**心理学博士学位**，我与他们合作处理他们的病人。很多**失眠**患者，还有**睡眠呼吸暂停**、不宁腿综合征、嗜睡症等问题，因为我有一个独特的特点，我是世界上168个没有上医学院却通过了医学委员会考试的人之一。所以我可以在那个框架内工作，真正理解很多正在发生的事情。我不开药，但说实话，在我看来，大多数人不需要**睡眠药物**。我通常可以让他们在不服用任何药物的情况下入睡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Yeah. So I've been an actively practicing sleep specialist for 26 years. So I work in offices with medical doctors cuz I'm not a medical doctor. I have a PhD and I work with them on their patients. lot of insomnia patients but also the apneas, the restless legs, the narcolepsies of the world because I have kind of a unique distinction in that I'm one of 168 people in the world who took the medical boards without going to medical school and passed. So I can work within that framework and really understand a lot of what's going on. I don't prescribe medication, but if I'm honest with you, most people don't need sleep medication as far as I'm concerned. I can get them to sleep usually without any medication at all.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 您也是一名心理学家？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And you're a psychologist as well?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是的。我是一名**临床心理学家**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: I am. I'm a clinical psychologist.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 这两个世界如何让1加1等于3呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And how does those two worlds make 1 plus 1 equal three?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 当然。当您谈论睡眠时，**心理学**无处不在。我认为人们睡不着觉的75%的原因是**焦虑**或**恐惧**。这绝对属于**心理学**的范畴。而且是不同种类的恐惧。有些恐惧是您知道的，就在您面前，比如白天发生的事情，但也可能是其他恐惧。可能是对您人际关系的恐惧。可能是经济上的恐惧。可能是各种各样的事情。所以，我认为所有这些事情中都发挥着很多**心理学**的作用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Sure. So when you talk about sleep, psychology is all over the place. I would argue 75% of the reason people don't sleep is anxiety or fear. That really falls well within the range of psychology for sure. Um, and it's different kinds of fears. It's fears that you know about that are right in your face, like something that's going on in your daytime, but it could be other fears. It could be fears of your relationship. It could be financial fears. It could be a whole host of different things. So, I think there's a lot of psychology that gets to be played in all of this kind of thing.

### 睡眠的基本原理

**Steven Bartlett**: 在我们真正深入细节和具体内容，开始帮助听众解决他们正在处理的问题之前，我还有两个问题。首先，我们这里有很多道具。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: I got two more questions before we really get into the details and specifics and start really helping the audience with whatever they're dealing with. The first is we have lots of props here.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Yes.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 请给我一个您将要展示的物品类型以及您带来这些精彩道具的原因的概览。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Give me a a topline view of the types of things you're going to show me and why you've brought all of these wonderful props.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 当然。所以，您可能会想象，我被问了很多问题，其中一个大问题是：我应该买什么样的床和枕头？所以，您旁边放着一大堆枕头，实际上是各种不同类型的。我想向您的观众展示如何选择枕头，以及哪种枕头适合哪种人。信不信由您，这就像一个量身定制的过程。我们将经历这个过程。这个设备，信不信由您，是一个**睡眠测试**。以前我们必须把您送到医院。是的，您可以把它解开。您必须把您送到医院。我们会在您身上贴27个电极，胸部绑上呼吸带。我们会用摄像头对准您。然后，顺便说一句，您应该能够入睡，对吧？我们应该能够监测您。历史上，我们做得很好。但**新冠疫情**爆发后，没有人愿意睡在别人前一天睡过的床上。所以，现在我们有了所谓的**家庭睡眠测试**（HSTS）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Absolutely. So, I get asked a lot of questions as you might imagine and um one of the big questions that I get asked is what bed and pillow should I buy? So, sitting next to you is a large stack of pillows, all different types, actually. And I want to be able to show some of your viewers how you look at pillows and which pillows make sense for which people. Believe it or not, there's like a fitting process. We're going to go through that. This device right here is a sleep test, believe it or not. So, it used to be we'd have to send you to the hospital. Yeah, you can unwind it. Uh, you have to send you to the hospital. We'd put 27 electrodes all over your body, respiratory belts across your chest. We'd have cameras zoomed in on you. And then, by the way, you're supposed to be able to go to sleep, right? And we're supposed to be able to monitor you. Now, historically, we were able to do that pretty well. But once COVID hit, nobody wanted to sleep in the same bed that somebody else had been sleeping in the day before. So, now we have what are called HSTS or home sleep tests.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 哇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Wow.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是的。我们会谈谈如何使用它以及它能告诉您什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Yeah. We'll talk about how to use it and and what it can tell you.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 在我们深入细节之前，我的最后一个问题是，作为一名**睡眠医生**，人们来找您咨询的最常见问题是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: My last question before we get into the details is what are the most popular questions that people come to you with as a sleep doctor?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是的。我想说大概有三大类，对吧？第一是：“嘿，**布鲁斯博士**，我睡着没问题，但我会在凌晨1点到3点之间醒来，然后需要20分钟或3个小时才能再次入睡。这到底是怎么回事？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Yeah. So, I'd say there's probably three biggies, right? Number one is, "Hey, Dr. Bruce, I fall asleep just fine, but I wake up somewhere between 1 and 3:00 in the morning, and it either takes me 20 minutes or 3 hours to fall back asleep. What the heck is going on there?"

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 您能帮人们解决这个问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And you can help people with that.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 当然。我将把我在诊所里所做的一切，一字不差地告诉大家。我将向大家解释我对我病人说的话，以及如何解决那个特定问题，因为它太普遍了。每个人都需要知道如何处理它。第二个问题是，我应该买什么样的床或枕头？我想我们会在那里解决这个问题。然后另一个人们经常问我的问题是，有没有某种时间安排？他们总是说，我感觉我的身体不对劲。他们会说，如果我生活在不同的时区，我感觉一切都会好起来。所以，睡眠的最基本知识。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Absolutely. I'm going to give everybody a exactly what I do in clinic. Like, I'm going to explain to everybody exactly what I say to my patients and how to go about getting through that particular problem because it's it's so flagrant. Everybody needs to know how to how to work with that. The second question would be um what bed should I buy or what pillow should I buy? I think we're going to address that over here. Um and then another one that people ask me all the time is, you know, is there some kind of timing? Is there some like I feel like my body is off. They say this all the time. They're like, if I just lived in a different time zone, I feel like everything would work out well. So the very basics of sleep.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 嗯哼。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Uhhuh.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 我需要了解哪些关于睡眠的基本知识，以及它对我们起到的作用，才能理解我们今天将要讨论的事情的背景？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: What do I need to know about what sleep is, the role it solves for us to even understand the context of the things we're going to talk about today?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是的。关于睡眠，真正重要的事情只有几件。第一是睡眠在大脑中是如何运作的。事实证明，大脑中有两个独立的系统。一个叫做**睡眠驱动**。另一个叫做**睡眠节律**。它们都以一种有趣的方式运作。它们都有一点像饥饿，对吧？所以**睡眠驱动**就像饥饿，因为我饿了。我饿了。我饿了。我吃了东西。那种饥饿感开始消散。睡眠也是如此。您醒着的时间越长，您就越困。从生物学的角度来看，这有点有趣。所以，当一个细胞吃掉一块葡萄糖时，会排出一些东西。其中一种叫做**腺苷**。它通过您的系统，到达一个非常特定的受体区域，随着**腺苷**的积累，您会越来越困。现在，我为什么要讲这么多细节？事实证明，当您看**腺苷**和**咖啡因**时，它们只相差一个分子。所以，这里有一个小贴士或技巧，早点告诉大家。我称之为**小睡拿铁**。您要做的是，拿一杯滴滤黑咖啡，扔几个冰块，对吧？只是为了让它冷却下来，尽快喝下去，然后立即小睡25分钟。您大脑中积累的**腺苷**会在您小睡时燃烧掉。**咖啡因**，因为它在分子结构上非常接近，可以进入那个受体位点。它会阻断任何新的**腺苷**。您可以精神焕发四个小时，保证有效。我与我合作的每一位**CEO**都使用它。所以，假设您前一晚只睡了三个小时，而您有一个重要的演讲要做，或者一个颁奖典礼什么的。您可以小睡25分钟左右，喝一杯**小睡拿铁**，您会感觉好很多。那就是**睡眠驱动**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Yep. There's only a few things that are truly important to understand about sleep. One is how does sleep work in the brain. It turns out that there's two separate systems in the brain. One is called your sleep drive. The other is called your sleep rhythm. And they both work uh in an interesting way. They're both a little bit like hunger, right? So sleep drive is like hunger because right I'm hungry. I'm hungry. I'm hungry. I eat something. that hunger begins to dissipate. Same holds true with sleep. The longer you stay awake, the more the more sleepy that you get. When you look at it from a biology standpoint, it's kind of interesting. So, when a cell eats a piece of glucose, something comes out the back end. One of those things is called a denisonin. It works its way through your system and goes to a very specific receptor area, as a denisonin accumulates, you get sleepier and sleepier and sleepier. Now, why am I going into so much detail? Turns out when you look at a denisonin and you look at caffeine, they're off by one molecule. So, here's a little tip or trick early in the pod for everyone. I call it the nappa latte. So, what you do is you take a cup of drip black coffee, just throw in a couple of ice cubes, right? Merely to cool it down, drink it as fast as you can, and immediately take a 25minute nap. The adenosin that's built up in your brain will burn through while you're napping. Caffeine, since it's so close in molecular structure, can fit into that receptor site. It blocks any new adenosin. You're good for four hours, guaranteed. I use it with every CEO that I work with. So, let's say you only got three hours of sleep the other night and you've got a big presentation to do or an awards ceremony or something like that. You can do a nappa latte for about 25 minutes or so and you will feel much better. That's sleep drive.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 让我确认一下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Let me just

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 当然。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Sure.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 我想确保我真正理解了这一点。您能再给我解释一遍吗，就好像我是一个16岁的孩子？喝咖啡然后小睡会让我感到精力充沛，因为人们会认为喝咖啡和小睡是……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: I want to make sure I really understand this. Can you explain this to me again as if I'm a 16-year-old? by having a coffee and then taking a nap would make me feel energetic because one would think that having a coffee and taking a nap are like

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 几乎不可能，对吧？所以，第一，**咖啡因**在小睡结束前不会起作用。很多人认为当我喝咖啡时，砰，它就起作用了，突然我就能获得很多能量。实际上**咖啡因**并不是这样运作的。它需要被喝下去，被吸收，被消化。在这一切发生的过程中，大约需要25到30分钟，您实际上正在小睡以降低大脑中积累的**腺苷**量。假设现在是下午2点，您只睡了4个小时，您感到非常疲惫，对吧？当您小睡25分钟时，所有积累的**腺苷**都会燃烧掉很多，然后**咖啡因**进入并阻断任何额外的**腺苷**进入。这样，您实际上是在给情况添加**咖啡因**，然后砰，您的能量就直线上升了。好的。所以**腺苷**停靠在我的大脑中会让我感到疲倦。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: would be almost impossible, right? So, number one, the caffeine doesn't kick in before the end of the nap. So, a lot of people think when I drink coffee, boom, it just kind of spins up and all a sudden I'm able to, you know, I get a lot of energy from it. That's really not actually how caffeine works. It has to go down, has to get absorbed, has to be digested. And so while all that's going on, which takes approximately 25 to 30 minutes, you're actually taking a nap to lower the amount of adenosin that has built up in your brain. Let's say it's 2 o'clock in the afternoon and you only slept for 4 hours and you are dragging, right? All that adenosine that's built up when you take that 25minute nap, you'll burn through a lot of it and then caffeine fits in and blocks any additional adenosin from coming in. So that way you're actually adding caffeine to the situation and boom, your energy goes straight. Okay. So adenosine is makes me tired when it's docked in my brain.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 完全正确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Exactly.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 所以我睡了4个小时，这意味着有很多**腺苷**，而睡眠会清除**腺苷**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So I have 4 hours sleep which means there's lots of adenosine and sleep get clears the adenosine.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 正确。然后**咖啡因**进入，因为它完美地契合了那个受体位点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Correct. And then caffeine comes in because it fits so perfectly into that receptor site

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 然后您就精神焕发了。那是**睡眠驱动**。**睡眠节律**与您的**昼夜节律**有关。对。所以有很多关于这方面的信息。但基本上，您的**昼夜节律**也和饥饿很像。对吧？您有没有注意到您在早餐时间、午餐时间、晚餐时间会感到饥饿，对吧？那是您的饥饿**昼夜节律**。对于睡眠来说，大多数人，至少在北美，倾向于在晚上10:30到11:00，11:30之间入睡。所以，那是**昼夜节律**。因此，当您的**昼夜节律**很高，您的**睡眠驱动**也很高时，您就会睡觉。但如果其中任何一个出了问题，那就是您有**睡眠障碍**或**紊乱的睡眠**的时候。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: and off you go. That's sleep drive. Sleep rhythm has to do with your circadian rhythm. Right. And so lots of lots of information about that. But basically your circadian rhythm is also a lot like hunger. Right? You ever notice you're hungry around breakfast time, around lunchtime, around dinner time, right? That's your circadian rhythm for hunger. For sleep, most people, at least here in North America, have a tendency to fall asleep somewhere between 10:30 and 11:00, 11:30 at night. So, that's kind of the circadian rhythm there. So, when your circadian rhythm is high and your drive is high, you sleep. But if either one of them is off, that's when you have a sleep disorder or disordered sleep.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 我的**昼夜节律**很高。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: My circadian rhythm is high.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 当您的**昼夜节律**处于最佳状态时，“高”可能不是正确的词。处于最佳状态。这意味着您正在遵守您的**昼夜节律**。现在您可能会问我另一个问题，我怎么知道我的**昼夜节律**是什么？我们将详细讨论**睡眠类型**，因为那就是您的**昼夜节律**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: When your circadian rhythm is on point, high is probably not the right word. On point. So meaning you are abiding by your circadian rhythm. Now another question you might say to me is well how do I know what my circadian rhythm is? And we're going to talk a lot about chronotypes cuz that's what your circadian rhythm is.

</details>

### 了解您的睡眠类型

**Steven Bartlett**: 好的。那我们来谈谈**睡眠类型**。您面前有一些卡片。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Okay. So let's do chronotypes then. You've got some cards in front of you.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是的。我挺喜欢这些卡片的。所以当我们谈论**睡眠类型**时，很多人可能听说过这个概念，但之前从未真正听说过“**睡眠类型**”这个词。所以，如果有人曾被称为“早起鸟”或“夜猫子”，那些就是**睡眠类型**。所以，我们有**早起鸟**。顺便说一句，这些人是天生的。您不能选择这个。您的基因组上有一个特殊区域叫做**PER3区域**。当您有一种叫做**单核苷酸多态性**（SNP）的东西时。如果它翻转到一边，您就是**早起鸟**。如果它翻转到另一边，您就是**夜猫子**。如果它没有翻转，您就在中间。好的？所以，到目前为止，我还没有告诉任何人任何新的东西。这都是我们已经学过的东西。新的部分是这种不规律性，它似乎发生在人们的睡眠时间表上。具体来说，是他们的**褪黑素**和**皮质醇**分泌的不规律。所以，所有这些都取决于您的身体何时产生**褪黑素**。所以，如果您是**早起鸟**，您的身体会在夜晚较早的时候，大约晚上8点开始产生**褪黑素**。这会让您想在晚上9:30左右上床睡觉。您有问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: I do. I kind of like these cards. So when we talk about chronotypes, a lot of people may have heard of the idea but not actually heard the term chronoype before. So if anybody out there has ever been called an early bird or a night owl, those are chronoypes. So, we've got early birds. These are people who, by the way, this is genetic. You don't you don't actually get to choose this. There's a special area on your genome called the PER3 area. And when you have something called a single nucleotide polymorphism or a snip. If it's flipped one way, you're an early bird. If it's flipped another way, you're a night owl. If it's not flipped, you're in the middle. Okay? So, so far, I haven't told anybody anything new. Like, this is this is all stuff that we've already learned. The new part is this irregularity that seems to happen for people during for their sleep schedule. Specifically, an irregularity in their melatonin and cortisol production. So, all of this is predicated on when does your body make melatonin. So, if you're an early bird, your body makes melatonin earlier in the night starting at around 8:00 in the evening. Makes you want to go to bed around 9:30. You have a question.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 所以，**褪黑素**是一种荷尔蒙。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So, melatonin is a hormone

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: it is

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 那是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: that

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 您体内产生的一种**荷尔蒙**，它实际上帮助您入睡。它引导，它告诉您的身体何时该睡觉，这与让您感到困倦的**腺苷**略有不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: you produce inside of your body that actually helps you sleep. It guides, it tells your body when it's bedtime, which is a little bit different than the adenosine, which makes you feel sleepy.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 我想现在听众会问自己，了解我的**睡眠类型**有什么关系？比如，它与我的生产力、我的生活方式、我的人际关系，以及任何对我重要的事物有什么关系？为什么它很重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: I guess people listening now would be asking themselves, why does it matter to know my chronotype? Like, as it relates to my productivity, the way I live my life, my relationships, whatever matters to me, why does it matter?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 因为我可以根据您的**睡眠类型**向您展示一天中进行几乎所有活动的最佳时间。所以，如果您知道您的身体何时在做某些事情，何时有**褪黑素**，何时有**皮质醇**或**肾上腺素**或所有这些其他东西，如果您知道这个时间表，您实际上可以改变您的活动，使其与您的身体自然产生**荷尔蒙**的时间相符，然后您就能更好地利用这些**荷尔蒙**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Because I can show you based on your chronoype the perfect time of day to do almost any activity. So if you f if you know when your body is doing certain things, when it has melatonin or when it has cortisol or adrenaline or all these other things, if you know the schedule, you can actually just change your activity to when your body is naturally producing the hormone and then you do the hormone better.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Okay,

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 那么我们来谈谈最简单的一个，那就是性爱，对吧？很多人想知道：“嘿，**迈克尔**，什么时候是做爱的最佳时间？”顺便说一句，我认为这可能是除了**失眠**和床垫问题之外，我被问得最多的第三个问题。我认为什么时候是性爱的最佳时间可能是我被问得最多的另一个问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: so let's talk about the easy one, which is sex, right? So a lot of people want to know, "Hey, Michael, what's the best time to have sex?" By the way, I think that might be the third question that I get asked most um often other than uh the insomnia one and the mattress one I think is what's the best time for sex might be the the other question that I get asked more than anything.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 如果您想做爱的时间和您的伴侣想做爱的时间不一致，那肯定很麻烦。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Must be tricky if you the time you want to have sex and the time your partner wants to have sex are off.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 嗯，这样想。如果您的伴侣是**早起鸟**，而您是**夜猫子**呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Well, think about it like this. What if your partner's an early bird and you're a night owl?

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 是的，我想那就是我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Yeah, I think that's me.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 别担心，我们会帮您解决的。所以，首先，这个问题有几个不同的答案。第一，您想要有一个时间。所以，首先，大多数人在晚上10:30到11:30之间亲密。这只是我们做的一项调查。所以，这很有道理。但有趣的是，您在晚上11:30的**荷尔蒙**状况并不太适合性爱。为了成功进行性爱，您需要**雌激素**、**睾酮**、**孕酮**、**肾上腺素**和**皮质醇**都处于高水平，而**褪黑素**处于低水平。您认为您在晚上10:30的**荷尔蒙**状况会是什么样子？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Don't worry, we're we're going to be able to fix you. So, first of all, there's a couple of different answers to this question. So, number one is you want to have a time. So, first of all, most people are intimate between 10:30 and 11:30 at night. That's just a survey that we did. So, it makes kind of a lot of sense. But here's what's interesting is your hormone profile doesn't look too good at 11:30 at night for having sex. In order to have successful sex, you want to have estrogen, testosterone, progesterone, adrenaline, and cortisol all to be high and melatonin to be low. What do you think your hormone profile looks like at 10:30 at night?

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 简直是相反的，对吧？**褪黑素**高，而所有其他东西都低。这是关于何时可能是最佳性爱时间的第一个提示。第二个提示，如果您碰巧与一个生理上是男性的人发生性关系，大多数男性早上醒来时会是什么样子？勃起。如果那不是大自然告诉您何时使用那个东西，我不知道什么才是。对吧？所以，当您开始研究它时，我们实际上做了调查，我们发现人们在早上做爱时，他们的连接感和表现都更好。现在，您是否需要先刷牙和漱口？是的，当然需要。对您的伴侣公平一点。但您会学到很多。再次强调，您的身体告诉您，这实际上是做这种事情的最佳时间。您知道有喝咖啡的最佳时间吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: It's literally the opposite, right? Melatonin is high and all those other things are low. That's hint number one as to when would probably be the best time to have sex. Hint number two, if you happen to be having sex with somebody who was born biologically male, what do most men wake up with in the morning? An erection. If that's not mother nature telling you when to use that thing, I don't know what is. Right? So, when you start to look at it, and we actually did the surveys, we discovered that people actually have greater connection and greater performance in their sex when they have sex in the morning time. Now, do you have to brush your teeth and throw in a little mouthwash first? Yes, of course you do. Like, let's be fair to your partner here. But you end up learning quite a bit. Again, your body is telling you this is actually the perfect time to do something like this. Did you know there's like a perfect time to have coffee?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 我不知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: I didn't.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 是的，根据您的**睡眠类型**，绝对有最佳时间。我经常问人们的第一件事，我也会问您，早上第一口喝的是**咖啡因**饮料吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Yeah, there's absolutely a perfect time based on your chronoype, too. One of the first things that I ask people all the time, I'll ask you, um, is the first liquid that crosses over your lips in the morning caffeinated?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是的。那么，我们来谈谈为什么这可能不是最好的主意。大多数人不知道，抱歉，大多数人不知道，睡眠本身是一个脱水事件。您整夜呼吸，仅通过呼吸中的湿度就会流失几乎一升水。**咖啡因**是一种利尿剂，这意味着它会让您想排尿。所以，当您已经流失了一升水，现在又喝了几杯**咖啡因**，这会让您想排尿，您会变成一个干瘪的葡萄干。好的？所以，我们需要让一些水进入您的体内。因此，我给我所有病人的一个重要建议是，醒来后的前90分钟不要喝**咖啡因**。现在，您会坐在这里说：“9分钟？**迈克尔**？这么长时间不喝**咖啡因**？”我怎么能做到呢？我有我的早晨例行公事。早上我能闻到咖啡的香味。它闻起来真好。一切都在进行。这怎么行得通呢？让我解释一下生物学。为了摆脱无意识状态，您需要两种**荷尔蒙**，而且需要很多。您需要**肾上腺素**和**皮质醇**，它们都能让您清醒。当您的大脑充满**肾上腺素**和**皮质醇**时，再加入**咖啡因**，这就像给吸食**可卡因**的人加淡茶。好的？与您大脑中的**荷尔蒙**这种强大的兴奋剂相比，它不是一种非常强大的兴奋剂。但如果您只等90分钟，**皮质醇**和**肾上腺素**会自然下降。如果您在那时喝**咖啡因**，它实际上会提高**皮质醇**，让您获得更大的回报。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Yes. So, let's talk about why that's probably not the best idea. So, most people don't know, sorry, most people don't know, but uh sleep in and of itself is a dehydrative event. You lose almost a full liter of water just from the humidity in your breath by by breathing all night long. Caffeine is a diuretic, which mean it makes you have to go pee. So, when you're already lost a liter, now you add a couple of cups of caffeine, which makes you have to pee, you're going to turn into a raisin before this whole thing is through. Okay? So, we need to get some water inside of you. And so, one of the big recommendations that I give all of my patients is don't have caffeine for the first 90 minutes you're awake. Now, you're going to sit here and say, "9 minutes? That's a Michael? That's a long time not to have any caffeine." Like, how am I going to do that? Like, I've got my morning routine. I can smell the coffee in the morning. It smells so good. Everything's going. How's how's this going to work? Let me explain the biology. In order to exit a state of unconsciousness, you need two hormones, and you need a lot of them. You need adrenaline and cortisol and they both wake you up. When you have a brain that's full of adrenaline and cortisol and you add caffeine to it, it's like it's like adding weak tea to somebody who's taking cocaine. Okay? It's not a very powerful stimulant compared to the hormones that are in your brain that are a powerful stimulant. But if you just wait 90 minutes, cortisol and adrenaline naturally drop. If you have your caffeine, then it actually boosts the cortisol and gives you a bigger bang for your buck. M

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 所以您在喝**咖啡因**之前先补充水分，大约在您醒来的前一个半小时内，如果可以的话，喝15到20盎司的水。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: so you hydrate before you caffeinate and about the amount somewhere between 15 and 20 ounces of water if you can get that down in the first hour and a half that you're awake.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 用英语怎么说？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: What's that in English terms?

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 哦，我不知道，我们得查一下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Oh, I don't know what that we'll have to look it up.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是一杯吗？是两杯吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Is it one cup? Is it two cups?

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 哦，我想大概是3到4杯水。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Oh, I would say it's probably 3 to four cups of water.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 好的。那很多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Okay. Well, that's a lot.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 嗯，别忘了您睡觉时流失了很多水，而且您可能前一天也流失了，比如说您锻炼了或者类似的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Well, don't forget you've lost a lot of water while you're sleeping and you might have lost it the previous day because let's say you worked out or things like that.

</details>

### 睡眠类型：狮子、熊、狼、海豚

**Steven Bartlett**: 那么，我们来谈谈这些**睡眠类型**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So, let's get into these chronotypes then.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是的。那么，我们从**狮子型**开始。**狮子型**是我的**早起鸟**。当您在早上6点收到一封电子邮件时，您就知道您身边有**狮子型**的人，对吧？那是已经起床一段时间，大脑已经开始活跃的人。**狮子型**喜欢列清单，每天从第一步到第二步到第三步。他们从遵循这个清单中获得很多自信和乐趣。但说实话，成为**狮子型**并不像听起来那么好，因为晚餐和电影对**狮子型**来说是不可能的。他们早上4:30、5点就起床了，对吧？他们不想深夜去看演唱会。他们想在8:30、9点左右睡觉。所以，当您看**狮子型**，或者我所说的**早起鸟**，他们有一些非常有趣的特征。他们占人口的10%到15%。从生物学特征的角度来看，他们的**褪黑素**分泌停止得早，**皮质醇**分泌开始得早。所以，他们的**褪黑素**在早上4:30、5点左右停止分泌，那时**皮质醇**开始分泌。这就是他们起得这么早的原因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Yeah. So, let's start off with the lion. So, lions are my early birds. Um, you know you've got a lion in your midst when you get an email at 6:00 a.m., right? That's somebody who's been up for a while and who's got their brain kind of cooking. Um, lions like to make a list and go from step one to step two to step three every single day. They get a lot of confidence and they get a lot of pleasure following uh this list. But, if I'm honest with you, being a lion isn't all it's cracked up to be because dinner and a movie is out for a line. They've been up since like 4:30, 5 o'clock in the morning, right? They don't want to go see a concert late at night. They want to go to bed at like 8:30, nine o'clock. So, when you're looking at lions or what I early birds, what I call lions, they've got some very interesting characteristics. They make up between 10 and 15% of the population from a biological characteristic standpoint, their melatonin stops early and their cortisol starts early. So, their melatonin stops at about 4:30, 5:00 in the morning, and that's when cortisol starts. And that's the reason why they wake up so early.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: **狮子型**的人大概在什么时间段醒来？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: What sort of window do the lions wake up in?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 所以，这很有趣，因为我有一些**狮子型**的人比较极端，比如他们早上4:30就起床了，这可能不是最好的主意。但一般来说，我的**狮子型**的人大约在5点到5:15之间起床，直到6点到6:30左右，但他们绝对是早起的人。他们吃一顿小早餐。他们不喜欢早上吃很多东西，因为很多人醒来后很快就会去锻炼。这与我其他一些**睡眠类型**的人非常不同。我的**夜猫子**不喜欢早上锻炼。他们不喜欢早上做任何事情。所以，我的**狮子型**喜欢早上早早锻炼。一顿清淡的早餐。而且，他们最佳的工作窗口通常在9:30到11:30之间。那才是所有好事情发生的时候。比如当他们需要处理细节，或者需要进行头脑风暴之类的，那才是很多奇迹发生的地方。到下午两点左右，**狮子型**的人体内就没有多少能量可以做很多好事情了。那时我会让**狮子型**的人做更多不需要大量认知能力的体力活动。所以，也许您会去散步，或者您会和那些不太注重细节但更注重过程的人在下午开会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: So, it's interesting because I've got some lions who are kind of extreme, like they're getting up at 4:30 in the morning, which is not really probably the best idea. But generally speaking, my lions get up right around 5 5:15 up until about 6:00 6:30, but they are definitely my early risers. They have a small breakfast. They don't like to eat a lot of food early in the in the morning time because a lot of these people like to go work out fairly quickly after they've uh after they've woken up. um which is very different than some of my other chronotypes. My night owls don't like to work out in the morning. They don't like to do anything in the morning. So, my lions like to work out early in the morning. A light breakfast. And also, their best work window is usually somewhere between like 9:30 and 11:30. Like, that's when all the good stuff gets done. Like when they have if they have to get details or if they have to do brainstorming or things like that, that's really kind of where a lot of the magic happens for them. By about two o'clock in the afternoon, there's not a lot of stuff left inside the lion to be able to do do a lot of good things. That's when I have lions do more physical activities that don't require a lot of cognition. So maybe you go for an afternoon walk or maybe you have uh you know you're you're meeting with your folks that may not be really detail oriented but more processoriented in the afternoon

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 行政工作之类的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: admin and stuff.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是的，绝对是。我实际上有一个人，他给他的整个公司都做了**睡眠类型**测试，然后根据会议的参与者来安排会议时间。比如，他让所有**早起鸟**在早上8点开会，然后所有**夜猫子**在下午4点开会。他说这太棒了。他说效果非常好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Yeah, absolutely. I actually had one uh fellow chronotype his entire company and then move meetings based on who was going to be in the meeting. Like it like he had all the early birds and he had meeting at 8:00 in the morning and then all the night owls he had a meeting at 4:00 in the afternoon. He said it was amazing. He said it worked out really really well.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 哇。下一个是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Wow. What's the next one?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 那么下一个是**熊型**。**熊型**代表介于**早起鸟**和**夜猫子**之间的人，对吧？所以**熊型**是最好的。老实说，我真希望我是**熊型**，因为整个生活日程都按照**熊型**的日程运作。朝九晚五对**熊型**来说是完美的。他们占人口的50%到55%。所以，实际上每两个人中就有一个是**熊型**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: So the next one is the bear. So bears are representative of people that are in between early birds and night owls, right? So bears are the best. Honestly, dude, I wish I was a bear because the whole schedule of life works on a bear schedule. 9 to5 is perfect for a bear. And they make up between 50 and 55% of the population. So, literally one out of two people is a bear.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 他们的工作高峰期是什么时候？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And when's their peak work time?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 所以，他们的工作高峰期倾向于在中午到下午2点之间。他们比您看到的**狮子型**晚一点。我认为其中一些人实际上在11点会更好。这有点有趣。我们已经有近300万人参加了测试，我们发现**熊型**内部似乎有**早熊型**和**晚熊型**。所以有些人属于这个类别，但喜欢早起一点。所以对他们来说，他们的生产力窗口可能是10:30、11点。但对于**晚熊型**来说，更像是11:30、12点，然后是之后的2小时窗口。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: So, their peak work time has a tendency to be sort of in the noon to 2:00 range. Um, they're a little bit later than what you would see the line. Some of them, I think, can actually be better at 11. It's kind of interesting. And we've had almost 3 million people take the quiz and we've discovered that inside of bears, there appear to be early bears and later bears. So there are people who fall into that category but like to get up a little bit early. So for them their productivity window is probably 10:30, 11. But for the later bears, it's more like 11:30, 12, and then it's about a 2hour window after that.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 对于正在收听的人，屏幕上目前显示的是一个表格，展示了不同的**睡眠类型**、醒来时间、工作高峰期和下午的低谷期。下一个**睡眠类型**是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: For the people listening, um on screen at the moment is a grid showing you the different chronotypes, the weight times, the peak work window, and the sort of afternoon slump time. What's the next chronotype?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 那么下一个**睡眠类型**是我，**狼型**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: So, the next chronotype is me, the wolf.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 我想我是**狼型**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: I think I'm a wolf.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 您可能是**狼型**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: You might be a wolf.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 我喜欢**狮子型**。我明白了。我明白了**狼型**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: I love lions. I get it. I get a wolf.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 嗯，您可能是。嘿，看，加入我吧。那会很棒。所以，**狼型**代表**夜猫子**，对吧？所以，**狼型**是我的艺术家、我的演员、我的创意人员。如果您认识一个创意人员，他们什么时候会有最大的想法？不是下午2点，而是凌晨2点。**狼型**是我的最高风险承担者。我知道您可能也属于这个类别。**狼型**是那些晚上11点才出现在派对上，但会待到凌晨2点，并帮助您收拾残局的人，他们比任何人都讨厌早晨。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Well, you might be. Hey, look, join me. It'd be great. So, wolves represent the night owls, right? And so, wolves are my artists, my actors, my creatives. If you know a creative, when do they get their biggest idea? It's not 2 o'clock in the afternoon, it's 2 o'clock in the morning. Wolves are my highest risktakers. I know that that probably you fall into that category as well. Wolves are the folks that show up at the party at 11 o'clock at night, but they stay till 2 o'clock in the morning and they help you clean up and they hate mornings more than anything.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 那我们应该谈谈**海豚型**吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So, should we talk about dolphins?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 下一个是什么？是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: What's the next one? Yeah,

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: **海豚型**。这是您所属的类别。那么，我们来谈谈**海豚型**是谁，以及这实际上代表什么？所以，**海豚型**通常非常聪明。他们通常是说话快、博览群书的人。这些人很像**狮子型**，他们喜欢早起。他们渴望更长时间的睡眠，但不幸的是，他们的身体没有长时间的**睡眠驱动**，所以他们经常感到非常沮丧。而且，我认为他们背后有一点点**焦虑**。所以他们很多人，例如，细节对**海豚型**来说非常重要，对吧？而对其他人来说，细节可能就不那么重要了。我认为我的很多**海豚型**的人都有一点**强迫症**。所以他们会专注于不同的事情。比如，如果我让**海豚型**的人做一个项目，一般来说，他们永远不会完成，直到我说：“您现在能把项目还给我吗？”因为他们总是在这里处理一点细节，或者在那里处理一点细节。但是**海豚型**是我的最爱。他们是我写这本书的对象。他们是我最喜欢合作的人。因为他们实际上是最容易合作的，因为一旦我向他们解释了他们的**荷尔蒙**是如何上下左右波动的，他们就会觉得更有道理。对于任何试图弄清楚自己属于哪种**睡眠类型**的人，他们应该去哪里做测试，需要多长时间？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: dolphins. This is the category that you fell into. So, let's talk about who are the dolphins and and what does this actually represent? So, dolphins are usually highly intelligent. They're usually people who are fast-talking, well- read. These are people who are a lot like a lion in terms of they like to get up. They crave longer bouts of sleep, but unfortunately their body just doesn't have a long sleep drive and so they get really frustrated a lot of times. Um, also I think they have just a teeny bit of anxiety behind them. So a lot of them, for example, the details really matter to a dolphin, right? Versus other people where details might not matter nearly as much. I think a lot of my dolphins have got just a little bit of obsessivecompulsive disorder. So they're kind of focused in on the on the different things. Like if I ask a dolphin to do a project, generally speaking, they're never finished with it until I say, "Can you just give me the project back now because they're always working on a little detail here or working on a detail there." Um, but dolphins are my favorite. They're the people that I actually wrote the book for. Um, they're the ones that I I enjoy working with the most. Um, because they're actually the easiest to work with because we can once I explain to them how their hormones can be up and down and sideways, it can it starts to make a lot more sense for them. And for anyone trying to figure out which one of these they are, where do they go to do the test and how long does it take?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是的，您可以访问我的网站，叫做**chronoquiz.com**。大概需要3到4分钟。一点也不长。它会问您很多关于睡眠、时间安排之类的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Yeah, you can go to my website. It's called chronoquiz.com. Uh, and uh, it takes about 3 4 minutes. It's not very long at all. It's going to ask you a bunch of questions about your sleep, about timing, things like that.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 好的，我会把它放在描述里。所以，听完之后，大家都可以去测试一下，并在评论区告诉我您的想法。所以，一旦您弄清楚您的**睡眠类型**是什么，请回到这一集，并在下面告诉我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Okay, I'll put that in the description. So, after you finish listening, you can all go take it and let me know your thoughts in the comments section as well. So, once you figure out what your chronosype is, come back to the episode and and let me know below,

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 请。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: please.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: **迈克尔**，我的睡眠会随着年龄变化吗？会的。绝对会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And does my sleep change with age, Michael? It does. Absolutely.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 那么，我的**睡眠类型**会随着年龄变化吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: So, do my do my chronotypes change with age?

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 实际上会的。信不信由您，您已经经历过所有**睡眠类型**了。当您还是个小婴儿时，您是**狮子型**。您睡得很早。您醒得很早，对吧？然后您是学步儿童，对吧？在小学时，您是**熊型**。您大约在7:30睡觉。您大约在7:30醒来。然后青春期来了，对吧？您想做什么？熬夜到午夜，睡到2点，对吧？您变成了**狼型**。然后在大约23、24岁时，您的**睡眠类型**倾向于固定在这三四种中的一种，然后您会保持这种状态很长一段时间，比如25到30年，直到您达到我的年龄。我很快就要58岁了，当您到了50多岁中期时，我们看到的是**褪黑素**的产生可能会减慢或提前。举个例子，如果您的父母还健在，您说：“嘿，爸爸妈妈，我想去吃晚饭。”他们会想什么时候去吃晚饭？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: They do, actually. So, believe it or not, you've gone through all the chronotypes already. When you're an itty bitty baby, you're a lion. You go to bed really early. You wake up really early, right? Then you're a toddler, right? And in in like grammar school, you're a bear. You're going to bed around 7:30. You're waking up around 7:30. Then adolescence hits, right? What do you want to do? Stay up until midnight and sleep until 2, right? You become a wolf. Then at about 23 24 your chronotype has a tendency to set into one of those three or four things and then you stay there for an extended period of time like 25 30 years until you hit my age. So I'm going to be 58 soon and right when you hit in the mid-50s what we see is melatonin production can either slow down or get earlier. So as an example if your parents are still alive and you said hey mom dad I want to go for dinner. What time would they want to go for dinner?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 早。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Early.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 对吧？下午4点，下午4:30，您会说：“妈妈，您怎么了？发生什么事了？”那是她的**睡眠类型**在倒退，您的睡眠会随着时间的推移而改变。明确地说，一旦您达到大约50岁，45或50岁，我们就会看到**褪黑素**的产生开始减慢。我们还会看到所谓的**脑电图唤醒**增加。所以，这些事情会打断您的睡眠，使其不再连续。那也可能是有问题的。所以，随着年龄的增长，会发生很多事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Right? four o'clock in the afternoon, 4:30 in the afternoon, you're like, "What is wrong with you, mom? What's going on?" That's her chronoype is going backwards and your sleep changes over the course of time. To be clear, at once you hit like age probably 50, 45 or 50, we start to see a slowdown in production of melatonin. We also see an increase in what are called EEG arousals. So things that break up your sleep and make it so it's not so continuous. That can be problematic as well. So there's a lot of things that can happen as you age.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 那么，我年纪越大，睡眠就越少吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So do I start sleeping less as I get older?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 您开始睡得质量更差。我并不认为总是更少。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: You start sleeping poorer quality. I'm not convinced that it's always less.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 那会让我脾气暴躁吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And is that going to make me grumpy?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是的，会的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Yes, it is.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 真的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Really?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 绝对会。睡眠质量差，我认为比睡眠量少要糟糕得多。我宁愿有人睡了5个小时的好觉，也不愿睡7个小时的糟糕浅睡眠。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Absolutely. Poor quality sleep is, I would argue, is much worse than poor quantity sleep. I I would rather I've got somebody who got 5 hours of really great sleep versus seven hours of really light crappy sleep every time.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 这是否意味着我年纪越大，脾气就越暴躁？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Does that mean that as I get older, I'm going to be more grumpy?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 这取决于您的睡眠质量。所以，我能教您的是如何避免随着年龄增长而睡眠质量变差。一个完美的例子是，很多年纪稍大的人习惯在深夜喝咖啡。嗯，如果您改变这个习惯，那么您的睡眠问题就不会那么多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: It depends on the quality of your sleep. So, what I can teach you is how to not get poor quality sleep as you age. Perfect example, a lot of folks who are a little bit on the older side are used to drinking coffee late in the day. Well, if you change that habit, then you don't have as many sleep problems.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 我不应该在深夜喝咖啡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And I shouldn't I shouldn't be having coffee late in the day at all.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 您可能想在下午2点左右停止，对吧？所以，如果您在下午2点左右停止，**咖啡因**的半衰期在6到8小时之间。所以，8小时后大约是晚上10点，这大约是人们想睡觉的时候。所以，我想那可能是最佳时间。我想到我的兄弟姐妹，我们都被叫醒去上学，我想到我在学校的表现，在我的所有四个兄弟姐妹中，我总是那个早上被叫醒时很挣扎的人，部分原因是我睡得晚。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Probably you want to stop by about 2 p.m., right? So, if you stop around 2 p.m., the halfife of caffeine is between 6 and 8 hours. So, 8 hours later is roughly 10, which is roughly when people are kind of wanting to go to sleep. So, I would say that that would probably be the the time to do it. I think about my siblings and us all being woken up for school and I think about my performance in school

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 但我也是那个在学校最挣扎的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: and of all my siblings, there's four of us. I was the one that always struggled with being woken up in the morning in part because I'd gone to bed later. But then I was also the one that struggled with school the most.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是的。那是**狼型**的特征，是这种夜型人的特征。说实话，大多数孩子不应该在他们现在起床的时间去上学，对吧？我的意思是，很多孩子在早上5:30、6点就起床了，他们要坐一个小时的校车，然后到达学校，如果您是青少年，我想没有什么比这更糟糕的了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Yeah. That characteristic of a wolf characteristic of this night person. If I'm honest with you, dude, like most kids should not be waking up at the time they're waking up to go to school, right? I mean so many kids are waking up at real like you know 5:30 6:00 in the morning they have an hourong bus ride then they get there and if you're an adolescent I don't think anything could be worse

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: right

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 所以我们必须真正开始尝试更周到一些，看看孩子们正在做些什么活动，如果他们需要的话，我们如何让他们在白天小睡，运动表现可能取决于睡眠，学业表现也可能取决于睡眠，所有这些不同的事情都令人难以置信。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: so we have to really start to try to be a little bit more thoughtful and look at like what are some of the activities that kids are doing how can we get them to maybe take naps during the day if they need them um athletic performance can depend on sleep academic performance can depend on sleep it's it's unbelievable all the different things yes

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 有没有关于不同**睡眠类型**的学业表现的研究？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: has there ever been any research done there has on different chronotypes academic performance.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 实际上有。他们没有直接将其标记为**睡眠类型**，但他们根据年龄范围进行了研究，我们知道，例如在美国，正在大力推动改变学校的开学时间，这样高中生就不会在早上7点开始上课，因为高中不应该在早上7点开始上课。学龄前儿童应该在早上7点开始上课，因为他们的身体自然会在那个时间醒来。所以，我们实际上看到**明尼苏达大学**做了一项很棒的研究，他们发现，当他们让学生晚一个小时上第一节课时，他们的成绩平均提高了一个等级，这意味着他们从C学生变成了B学生，或者从B学生变成了A学生，仅仅通过改变第一节课的时间。所以这应该能让您很好地了解这些大领域，所有孩子都容易受到影响。这并不是什么新鲜事。这些研究已经进行了很长一段时间了。现在实际上有一个全面的运动，试图让学校的开学时间推迟。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: There has been actually they haven't they labeled it directly as chronotypes but they've looked at it based on age range and we know that for example here in the United States there's a big push for to change school start times so that way high schoolers aren't starting at 7:00 in the morning because high schools shouldn't be starting at 7 o'clock in the morning. Preschoolers should be starting at 7 o'clock in the morning because their body naturally wakes up at that time. So, we've actually seen there was a great study um that was done at the University of Minnesota that discovered that um when they just had people come in 1 hour later from their first period, they improved by one full letter grade, meaning they went from being C students to being B students or from B students to A students merely by changing the timing of their first class. So that should give you pretty good insight as to sort of these big area like and and all children are vulnerable to this. Like this is not like I'm not telling you anything that's new. This is these are studies that have been going on for quite a while. And there's actually a whole movement trying to get school start times to to slow down now.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 查阅一些研究，它说研究一致表明，**早晨型**的人，也就是**狮子型**，获得更高的分数，不是因为智商更高，而是因为考试安排在他们警觉性最高的时间段。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Looking at some of the research here, it says research consistently shows that morning types, which is the

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: **狮子型**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: lion,

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 您说对了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: the lion, earn higher grades not due to higher IQ, but because exams are scheduled during their peak alertness windows. You got it.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 这太疯狂了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: That's crazy.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 有时**狼型**的人会更聪明，但因为他们无法在那些早晨时间表现，所以没有人知道。记住，**狼型**是我的创意人员。您认为科技界的一些伟大的创意创新和想法是从哪里来的？对吧？这些都是那些熬夜编码，试图弄清楚正在发生什么事情的**狼型**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Sometimes wolves turn out to be much smarter, but because they're they can't perform at those early times, nobody knows. Remember, wolves are my creatives. Like, where do you think some of these create great creative innovations and ideas come from in the tech world, right? Like, these are the wolves that are out there that are up late at night coding and trying to figure out what's going on.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 当您想到它时，这很酷。我只是，有一项2020年的研究叫做**同步效应**，近800名学生发现了明显的**同步效应**。当他们的课程安排与他们的**睡眠类型**匹配时，学生的表现明显更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: It's pretty cool when you think about it. And I just there's this thing called the synchronous synchrony effect from a study in 2020 where nearly 800 students found a clear synchrony effect. Students performed significantly better when their class schedule matched their chronotype.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 完全正确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Exactly.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 那些**早晨型**的人在早晨的课程中表现出色，而**夜猫子**或**狼型**的人在下午或晚上测试时，往往能迎头赶上并超越**早晨型**的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Those morning people dominated in morning classes and and the owls um or the wolves often caught up and outperformed the morning people when tested in the afternoon or evening.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 完全正确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Exactly.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 这非常引人入胜。现在这样想。您能想象一个学校系统，如果我们识别出孩子在特定年龄段的**睡眠类型**，然后我们改变考试时间，让他们在高峰期进行测试，会怎么样？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: It's pretty fascinating. Now think about it like this. Could you imagine a school system where if we identified children's chronotypes during their particular age range and then we changed the testing so that they got tested when they're at their peak hours?

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Yeah.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 他们实际上会做得更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: They'd actually do better.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 人们不知道这一点，但我早上从不做播客。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: People don't know this, but I never do p podcasts in the morning.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 我从不怪您。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: I don't blame you ever.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 您不应该。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: You shouldn't. Yeah.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 那不是您的时间。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: It's it's not your time. Yeah.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 对。比如您有一个非常特定的订阅时间，我认为它对您很有效。所以我想您应该遵守它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Right. Like you have a very specific subscribed time that I think works well for you. So I think you should abide by that.

</details>

### 睡眠时长与质量

**Steven Bartlett**: 睡眠时长。关于您应该睡多久有很多讨论。真相是什么？是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Duration of sleep. There's lots of conversation around how long you're supposed to sleep for. What what's the truth? Yeah.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 8小时是个神话。公平地说，我们是从30年代开始提出这个概念的。**斯坦福大学**有一项很棒的研究，得出了8小时13分钟加减的结论。这就是我们提出这个想法的来源。事实是，7到9小时才是人们应该追求的睡眠量。但有些人没有那种奢侈。有些人没有那么多时间可以用于睡眠，所以他们睡得少一点。但对于最低限度，我不喜欢任何人睡少于6小时。当一个人睡少于6小时时，他们的驾驶能力会下降。所以您不能操作机器。所以如果您开车上班，或者万一，拼车送孩子上学，而您只睡了不到6小时，那可能不会有好结果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 8 hours is a myth. Let's be fair. Like we came up with that from like the 30s. There was a great study at Stanford that came up with 8 hours and 13 minutes plus or minus. And that's kind of where we came up with that as an idea. The truth of the matter is somewhere between 7 and 9 hours really is kind of the amount that people should be looking for. But some people don't have that luxury. Some people don't have that much time that they can put towards sleep and so they get a little bit less sleep. But for the lower level limit, I don't like anybody getting less than 6 hours. When somebody gets less than 6 hours sleep, their driving is off. And so you can't operate machinery. So if you're driving to work or god forbid, carpooling your kids to school and you're only you only got, you know, less than 6 hours of sleep on on board, it's probably not going to go well.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 我们必须在这里停下来谈谈父母，因为听着，您现在是父母，或者将来可能会是。绝对是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: We we do have to stop here and talk about parents because listen, you're either a parent now, you might be someday. Absolutely.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 也许您不会是。但对于那些，我对父母怀有巨大的敬意，因为您知道，我还没有成为父母。我希望我能成为。但是当我看到我的兄弟，他有三个七岁以下的孩子，他失去了多少睡眠？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Maybe you won't be. But for those I've just got a huge amount of respect for parents because you know I've gone I'm not a parent yet. I hope I will become one. But when I see what my brother who has three kids under the age of what seven now um how much sleep has he lost?

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 很多，他的妻子也是。但是您肯定经常遇到父母来找您说：“我该怎么办？我必须在孩子醒来时起床，但这正在破坏我的关系，我的婚姻，我的性生活，无论是什么。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: A lot and and and his wife as well. But um you must get parents coming to you all the time being like what the hell do I do? Like I've got the I've got to wake up when the kids wake up and but I'm it's destroying my my relationship, my marriage, my sex, whatever it might be.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是的。所以抚养孩子和睡眠很难共存，但并非不可能。这真的与纪律和为自己思考一些想法有关。我的儿子23岁，女儿22岁，所以我已经有点脱离每天与他们打交道的范围了。但是，就像我之前说的，我负责我们家的早晨，叫醒他们。这很不容易，对吧？所以，我首先要向父母解释的是，特别是如果他们有一个睡眠模式不规律的孩子，并且真的给其他人带来了混乱，比如一个孩子不睡觉，让整个房子都醒着。您首先要做的是，教育孩子，对吧？很多孩子不知道他们正在做的事情会造成很多问题。他们只是孩子。他们只是玩得很开心。他们精力充沛。他们想保持清醒。所以您要教育他们，说：“嘿，现在是放松的时候了。这是您的身体恢复的时候。这是您第二天可以进行运动或戏剧或任何您喜欢的事情的方式。”您可以很容易地将它与睡眠和表现联系起来，所以让他们理解这一点变得非常非常关键。第二是制定一些指导方针，制定睡觉时间和起床时间，并尽可能严格遵守。对于父母，我经常告诉他们要做的是，比如，在孩子上床睡觉后，如果您的孩子有睡眠问题，轮流照顾。做我所说的“值班”方法。所以，作为一名医生，有时，您知道，您半夜会接到电话，因为您正在医院为您的朋友或其他病人值班。您在值班。所以，当有两个人管理一个孩子时，一个人负责周一、周三、周五晚上，另一个人负责周二、周四、周六。周日掷硬币决定。所以，如果孩子凌晨2点醒来，父母双方都不会醒着。一个父母承担责任。另一个可以闭着眼睛继续睡觉。有一项有趣的研究，观察了孩子哭泣时床上男性和女性的表现。女性会照顾孩子，而男性则躺在那里假装睡觉，以便能够继续睡觉，对吧？那是有问题的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Yeah. So parenting children and sleep are difficult to coexist, but they're not impossible. It really has to do with discipline and kind of thinking through some ideas for yourself. When my So I have a 23-year-old son and a 22-year-old daughter, so I'm a little bit out of the the realm of having to deal with them every day. Um, but I was, like I said before, I was in charge of mornings uh at our house waking them up. And it's a lot, right? And so the very first thing that I try to explain to parents, especially if they have a child who has an irregular sleep pattern and is really causing chaos for the rest, like one child who won't go to sleep and it's keeping every the whole house up. First thing you want to do, educate the kid, right? A lot of kids don't know what they're doing is causing a lot of problems. They they're just kids. They're just hanging out having fun. You know, they're they've got energy. They want to be awake. So that you want to educate them and say, "Hey, now is a particular time to wind down. This is where your body recovers. this is how you get to do sports the next day or theater the next day or ac whatever your computers whatever your thing is you can tie it to sleep and performance pretty easily and so getting them to understand that becomes very very critical number two is have some guidelines right have bedtimes have wake up times and follow them as quick as closely as you can for parents oftentimes what I try to tell them to do is like look after your child goes to bed if you've got a child that has problems for sleeping take turns. Do what I call the on call method. So, as a doctor, sometimes, you know, you get a call in the middle of the night because you you're covering patients at the hospital for your buddy or something like that. You're on call. So, when you've got two people who are managing one child, one person handles Monday night, Wednesday night, Friday night, the other one handles Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday. You flip a coin for Sunday. So, if the kid wakes up at 2 o'clock in the morning, both parents aren't awake. One parent has that responsibility. the other one can keep their eyes closed and go to sleep. Interesting study was done looking at men and women in bed when a child cries. So women take care of the child whereas men lie there and fake sleeping in order to be able to stay asleep, right? That's problematic. Um in a lot of

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 他们在研究中知道他们是假装睡觉的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: they know in the study that they were fake sleeping

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 因为他们事后问了那些男人在做什么，他们都说他们醒了，并且在假装睡觉。当您想到它时，这很疯狂。但这对于父母来说是个大问题，对吧？很多父母转向我，他们说：“这正在扼杀我们的婚姻。”他们说：“我们已经三年没有性生活了，因为我们有一个孩子，也许孩子有特殊需求，或者孩子没有特殊需求，但有其他问题，或者只是正常的发育，您知道，他们担心。”所以，我喜欢和父母坐下来做的是，第一，让我们弄清楚您的孩子需要什么时候睡觉，并制定一些指导方针和规则。但第二，让我们为您也做同样的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: because they asked the men afterwards what were you doing and they all said they woke up and they were faking it. It's pretty crazy when you think about it. But this is a big this is a big deal for parents, right? A lot of parents turn to me and they're like, "This is killing our marriage." Like, "We haven't had sex in, you know, three years because we've got a child who maybe the child has special needs or maybe the child doesn't have special needs, but has other things going on or maybe it's just normal development and and you know, they're worried about it." And so, what I like to sit down with parents and do is number one, let's figure out when your kid needs to sleep and let's set some guidelines and rules. But number two, let's do the same for you.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 对吧？很多父母在压力过大时，他们做的第一件事就是，拿起一杯葡萄酒，对吧？公平地说，葡萄酒可能是您对睡眠能做的最糟糕的事情。现在，我将教人们如何仍然可以喝一两杯**酒精**，而不会完全破坏您的睡眠。但我想非常清楚一件事。如果您在睡前使用**酒精**作为减压工具，那可能会严重扰乱您的睡眠。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Right? A lot of parents when they're super stressed out, one of the first things they do, grab a glass of wine, right? Wine's about the worst thing you could possibly do for sleep to be fair. Now, I'm going to teach people how you can still have a glass or two of alcohol and not completely destroy your sleep. But I want to be very clear about something. If you're using alcohol as a stress relief tool at night before bed, it's messing up your sleep probably pretty bad.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 您可能睡着了，但您的睡眠质量是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: You might be asleep, but the quality of your sleep is

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 糟糕的。对吧？有趣的是，在**酒精**会抑制的睡眠阶段，也就是第三和第四阶段睡眠中，最有趣的是，在那个特定的睡眠阶段，有一种叫做**淋巴系统**的东西会进来，清除那些倾向于在大脑中积累的**蛋白质**。当**蛋白质**在大脑中积累时，它们会缠绕在神经周围，那就是**阿尔茨海默病**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: is [ __ ] It's awful, right? And interestingly enough, during the one stage of sleep that alcohol knocks out, which is stage three and four sleep, what's the most interesting is that dur during that particular stage of sleep, there's something called the glimpmphatic system that comes in and scoops out these proteins that have a tendency to accumulate in your brain. And when proteins accumulate in your brain, they wrap around the nerves and that's called Alzheimer's disease.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 所以第四阶段睡眠对于避免**阿尔茨海默病**至关重要。当您饮酒时，您会破坏第四阶段睡眠。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: So stage four sleep is imperative to avoid Alzheimer's disease. And when you drink alcohol, you destroy stage four sleep. H.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 所以，如果没人喝酒会很棒，但我没那么傻。而且，我喜欢**波本威士忌**。我喜欢**威士忌**。我偶尔也喜欢喝一杯**香槟**。那么，您如何才能成功地继续饮酒，同时仍然获得一个像样的夜晚睡眠呢？我给您一个快速的方法，对吧？假设您在6:30吃晚饭，喝第一杯葡萄酒，然后喝一杯水，对吧？然后您的第二杯葡萄酒大约在7:00开始，对吧？然后您喝第二杯水。然后您在7:30之前停止所有饮酒。您等待3个小时，也就是10:30，然后您就可以上床睡觉了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So, it would be great if nobody drank alcohol, but I'm not so stupid as to think that. Plus, I like bourbon. I like whiskey. I enjoy a glass of champagne every once in a while. So, how can you successfully still drink alcohol and still get a decent night's sleep? I'm going to give you a quick one, right? Let's say you're having dinner at 6:30, have your first glass of wine, then have a glass of water, right? Then your second glass of wine starts at, let's say, almost 7:00, right? Then you have your second glass of water. Then you stop everything by 7:30. You wait 3 hours, which would be 10:30, and then you can go to bed.

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 为什么要喝水？为什么要等待？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Why the water? Why the weight?

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 所以，水有助于将其冲刷通过系统。它还会填饱您的胃，这样您就不会喝太多。所以，您体内有更多的液体，这样您就不会喝额外的葡萄酒。而且，它会让您想排尿，这也会冲刷系统。3小时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So, the water helps wash it through the system. Also fills your stomach up so you don't have too much. So, you you've got more fluid in there so that way you don't drink extra wine. Um, and it makes you have to pee, which flushes the system out as well. The 3 hours.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 而且它能补水。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: And it hydrates you.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 是的。好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: It does. Okay.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 绝对是。因为记住，葡萄酒会从您的系统中排出**镁**和大部分水分，因为它会让您想排尿。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Absolutely. Because remember, wine pulls uh both magnesium and uh most water out of your system because it makes you have to go pee.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 有助于缓解宿醉。所以，我想说有几件不同的事情。第一，这绝对有助于缓解宿醉，因为您摄入了水分。对于我的很多病人，我告诉他们，您能做的最后一件事是喝一点**椰子水**。**椰子水**富含**锌**、**镁**和**维生素B**。这些都是您饮酒时会从体内流失的一些东西。顺便说一句，您知道有针对您**睡眠类型**的“欢乐时光”吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Helps with the hangover. So, there's a couple of different things that I would say. Number one, this definitely helps with the hangover because you've got water going in. For a lot of my patients, what I tell them is the very last thing that you could do is have a little bit of coconut water. So, coconut water is loaded with zinc, magnesium, and vitamin B. And those are some of the things that get pulled out of your system uh when you're drinking. By the way, did you know that there are happy hours specific to your chronoype?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 不知道。没有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Didn't know that. No.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 是的。这很有趣。所以，它很酷的地方在于，您的身体会产生一种叫做**酒精脱氢酶**的东西，这是您代谢**酒精**的方式，但它会在特定的时间进行，而且每个**睡眠类型**的时间都不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Yeah. So, it's kind of interesting. So here's what's cool about it is your body produces something called alcohol dehydrogenase which is how you metabolize alcohol but it does it at a particular time and the time is different for each chronotype.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 所以您的身体在基本上下午4点到8点之间饮酒效率最高，这是很多人所知的“欢乐时光”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: So your body is most efficient at drinking between basically the hours of 4 and 8 happy hour as a lot of people know it.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 您如何看待晚上吃饭的时间？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And how do you think about what time you eat at night time?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 真是个好问题。所以睡前3小时，您要停止摄入液体，包括**酒精**和食物。您要在睡前3小时停止所有这些。所以您的身体大约需要那么长时间来消化，清除所有食物，然后让所有用于消化的机制现在能够重新集中到睡眠的恢复过程中。但是，我告诉您，我见过一些人，有些人声称如果他们在早上11点停止进食，那会极大地帮助他们晚上的睡眠。事实证明，这与您的**心率**有关。所以，一个非常重要的指标，我们所有的观众和听众都想知道的是，为了进入无意识状态，您的**心率**需要达到60或以下。当您的胃里有食物时，您的**心率**是上升的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Such a great question. So 3 hours before bed, you want to stop fluids including alcohol um and food. You want to just stop it all 3 hours before bed. So it takes your body about that level of time to number one digest, clear all the food, and then have all the mechanisms that are working towards digestion now be able to be refocused onto the recovery process of sleep. However, I I will tell you that there's this uh I've seen a couple people and there are people out there that are claiming that if they stop eating at 11:00 in the morning that it helps their sleep dramatically at night. And it turns out it has to do with your heart rate. So, one of the big metrics that is very important that all of our viewers and listeners want to know is you need a heart rate of 60 or below in order to enter into a state of unconsciousness. And when you've got food in your stomach,

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 您的**心率**会上升。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: your heart rate is up.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: That's right.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 所以，对。所以您等待的时间越长，您的**心率**就越低，就越容易入睡。所以当我们谈论，举个例子，让我们回到父母的话题，对吧？您让您的孩子早点吃饭，然后您做什么？哦，然后您回去和您的配偶吃晚饭，对吧？也许那不是最好的主意，因为您吃晚饭太晚了。也许您应该和您的孩子一起吃晚饭，对吧？享受与他们在一起的时光，早点吃饭，因为那会给您更多的时间在之后放松并上床睡觉。我说这很合理，因为我记得我以前讲过一两次这个故事。我记得当我在洛杉矶做一些播客时，我们请来了**塞斯·罗根**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So, right. So if the longer you can wait, the lower your heart rate is, the easier it gets into sleep. And so when we're talking about So a great example, let's get back to parents for a second, right? You feed your kids at an earlier time and then what do you do? Oh, then you go back and have dinner with your spouse, right? Maybe that's not the best idea because you're having dinner so late. Maybe you should have dinner with your kids, right? And and enjoy that time with them and eat earlier because that gives you more space later on to be able to relax and go to bed. I said that tracks because I remember I've told this story once or twice before. I remember when I was doing some podcasts over here in LA, we had Seth Rogan on.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 当然。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Sure.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 我住在酒店的前一天，我从迷你吧拿了一块饼干。我承认。我吃了饼干，然后很快就上床睡觉了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And the day before in the hotel before I lived here, I had a cookie from the mini bar. I'm going to admit it. I had the cookie and then I went to bed pretty quickly.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 它们太好吃了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: they're so good.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 是的。然后我第二天看了我的**Whoop**，我的**心率**在入睡后的前2到3小时内大约是75或80。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: It was And then I went to bed pretty quickly. Oh god, we were just terrible. And I was looking at my whoop the next day ad and it my heart rate was like 75 or 80 for the first 2 to 3 hours after I got into bed.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 这不是很疯狂吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Isn't that crazy?

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 我醒来时感觉糟透了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And I woke up feeling like hell.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Yep.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 第二天过得很糟糕。我在谈话中表现得很糟糕，我看着我的，哦，天哪，是那块饼干。它让我的**心率**升高了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Terrible day the next day. I was terrible during the conversation and I looked at my go, "Oh my god, it was that cookie. It put my heart rate high."

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 所以除此之外，还有**糖**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: So also on top of that is sugar.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 是的。我的意思是，是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Yeah. I mean, [ __ ] me. Yeah.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 对。所以**糖**实际上会减缓**褪黑素**的产生。记住，**褪黑素**是启动睡眠引擎的关键。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Right. So sugar turn so sugar actually slows production of melatonin. Remember melatonin is kind of the key that starts the Yeah. The key that starts the engine for sleep.

</details>

### 睡前放松技巧

**Steven Bartlett**: 那么，我还能做些什么来确保我上床睡觉时**心率**较低呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So is there anything else that I can do to make sure my heart rate is low as I get into bed?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 绝对可以。冥想。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Absolutely. Meditate.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Okay.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: **呼吸练习**。所有这些都能降低我的**心率**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Breath work. All kinds of brings my heart rate down.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 是的。绝对是。所以很多人没有意识到的是，仅仅因为我们在呼吸，并不意味着我们实际上是以一种对睡眠有帮助的方式、形式和形态在呼吸。所以，在我最近的书《**睡眠、饮水、呼吸**》中，我谈了很多关于**呼吸练习**，它是什么以及它如何对您起作用。但我很乐意教您我最喜欢的**呼吸练习**和冥想形式。我认为您会从中受益匪浅。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Yeah. Absolutely. So what a lot of people don't realize is just because we're breathing doesn't mean we're actually breathing in a way, shape, and form that can be helpful for us for sleep. So, in my most recent book, Sleep, Drink, Breathe, I talk a lot about breath work and what is it and how does it work for you. But I'd love to teach you my favorite form of breath work and meditation. Um, that I think you'll you'll get a lot out of. So,

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 我在睡前做这个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: and I do this before bed.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 完全正确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Exactly.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Okay.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 顺便说一句，如果您半夜醒来，您也可以这样做。对。所以，我们来谈谈如何入睡，并为此做一些放松练习。然后我将给您一些不同的练习，用于半夜醒来。所以，我们来谈谈夜晚的开始。所以，第一，您需要跑道来降落飞机。好的？很多人认为他们只是等着头在电视前摇晃，然后他们去刷牙，上床睡觉，然后突然他们就完全清醒了，他们不知道发生了什么，对吧？所以，您的系统需要时间来关闭。它不是一个开关。它更像慢慢地把脚从油门上移开，慢慢地把脚放在刹车上。有一个过程。您应该需要大约12到15分钟才能真正入睡。好的？所以第一，我要求人们做的是，把睡前一小时分成三个20分钟的片段，对吧？所以假设您晚上11点睡觉，从10点开始。顺便说一句，在您的手机上设置一个闹钟，告诉您现在是10点，因为很容易错过您的睡觉时间，然后突然一切都失控了。所以设置闹钟，20分钟做您必须做的事情。所以，在我们家，以前是为孩子们准备上学用的背包，找运动器材，也许为第二天的工作准备我的东西，或者发送最后一封电子邮件，类似的事情。20分钟用于个人卫生，对吧？刷牙，洗脸，也许洗个澡，类似的事情。然后20分钟用于某种形式的冥想、放松、祈祷。我不在乎您做什么，但它必须是能让您平静下来的事情。好的？所以，我最喜欢的一种技巧是**冥想**。现在，我实话告诉您。我是一个糟糕的**冥想者**。我从未能够做到。我甚至被**冥想静修营**赶出来过，因为我就是那种会说：“怎么回事？我做得对吗？”您知道，我就是那种人。所以，有人告诉我一个叫做**Muse头带**的工具。我们这里有一个。所以，这是我个人的**Muse**。我实际上是从家里带来的。您会注意到里面有传感器。耳塞旁边也有传感器。所以发生的情况是，您把它戴在头上，对吧？它会测量您的**脑电波**。所以当我们，是的。看看。所以当我们做的时候，我们正在测量**脑电波**。是的。完全正确。它戴在后面。是的。就是这样。所以它很酷的地方在于它连接到一个应用程序。然后当它测量您的**脑电波**时，您正在听特定的音乐。它可能是一个引导式**冥想**。它可能是任何这些东西。当您这样做时，音量会降低。然后您就知道您正在接近**冥想状态**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: And you can, by the way, you can do it in the middle of the night if you wake up as well. Right. So, let's talk about how to get how to fall asleep and do some relaxation exercises for that. And then I'm gonna give you some different ones for in the middle of the night. So, let's talk beginning of the night. So, number one, you need runway to land the plane. Okay? So many people think they're just waiting for their head to be bobbing in front of the TV and then they go brush their teeth and they get in bed and then all of a sudden they're wide awake and they don't know what's going on, right? So, you need time for your system to shut down. It's not an onoff switch. It's more like slowly pulling your foot off the gas and slowly putting your foot on the brake. There's a process. It should take you about 12 to 15 minutes to actually fall asleep. Okay? So number one, what I ask people to do is take the last hour before bed and chop it up into three 20 minute segments, right? So let's say you're going to bed at 11, starting at 10:00. And by the way, set an alarm on your phone to to tell you that it's 10:00 because it's really easy to slide by your bedtime and then all of a sudden it's like all bets are off. So set the alarm 20 minutes for [ __ ] you just got to do. So, in our house, it used to be getting backpacks together for school for our kids, finding sports equipment, maybe laying out my stuff for work the next day or getting last emails sent, something like that. 20 minutes for hygiene, right? Brush your teeth, wash your face, maybe take a shower, something along those lines. And then 20 minutes for some form of meditation, relaxation, prayer. I don't care what you do, but it has to be something that's calming to get you there. Okay? So, my one of my favorite techniques to do is meditation. Now, I'm going to be honest with you. I'm a terrible meditator. I have never been able to do it. I've actually gotten kicked out of meditation retreats because I'm the guy that's like, "What's going on?" Like, am I doing it right? You know, I'm kind of that that person. And so, I was I was told about this tool called a Muse headband. We have one right here. So, this is my personal Muse. I actually brought it from home. And um you'll notice on the inside there are sensors here. And there are sensors along the earpiece here. And so what happens is is you wear it on your head, right? And it's measuring your brain waves. And so when we're Yeah. Check it out. And so when we're when we're doing it and we're measuring brain waves. Yep. Exactly. And that goes on the back part. Yeah. There you go. So what's cool about this is it's attached to an app. And then while it's measuring your brain waves, you're listening to a particular music. It could be a guided meditation. It could be any of those things. And while you're doing this, the volume gets lower. And then you know you're getting closer to a meditative state.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 当音量降低时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: The volume comes down when

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 在应用程序上，当您的**脑电波**开始放松时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: on the app when your brain wave starts to relax.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 哦，好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Oh, okay.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 所以您会立即得到反馈。如果您想的话，我们可以试试。但这很有趣。当您进入**阿尔法状态**时，小鸟就会开始唱歌。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: So, you're immediately getting feedback. We can try it if you want. Um, but it's pretty interesting. And then when you get to the alpha state, little birds start chirping.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: **阿尔法状态**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: The alpha state.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是的。**阿尔法状态**是当您闭上眼睛，您的**脑电波**处于最放松的状态时。它被称为**阿尔法状态**。这正是人们在**冥想**时试图达到的目标。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Yeah. The alpha state is when your eyes are closed and you're at the most relaxed state of your brain waves. It's called the alpha state. And that's really what people are trying to get to for meditation.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 您与这家公司有任何关联吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And are you affiliated with this company in any way?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 我没有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: I am not.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 它的价格是多少？我想大约是275美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And how much does it cost? I think it's around $275

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 我想是头带。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: I think is the headband.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 好的。有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Okay. Interesting.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 这非常引人入胜。我对它们印象深刻。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: It's pretty fascinating. Um I I've been pretty impressed with them.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 所以那是**冥想**。您之前也谈到了**呼吸练习**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So that's meditation. You talked about breath work as well before.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是的。我们来谈谈它。所以我做的另一件事是，我做一些，这不是**呼吸练习**。这叫做**渐进式肌肉放松**。所以这是您从脚开始，一直向上，绷紧和放松肌肉。当您绷紧和放松肌肉时，您会感受到释放那种紧张后的放松，它有助于您入睡。实际上，您知道我可以做什么吗？我可以给您发送一个音频文件，里面有我引导您进行**渐进式肌肉放松**，如果您愿意的话，我们可以免费提供给大家。没什么大不了的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Yeah. Let's talk about it. So one of the other things that I do is I do something Well, this isn't breath work. This is called progressive muscle relaxation. So this is where you tense and relax muscles starting from your feet and going all the way up your body. And as you tense and relax the muscles, you feel that relaxation from releasing that tension and it helps you fall asleep. Um, actually, you know what I can do is I can send you a an audio file that has me walking through progressive muscle relaxation that we can make available for everybody if you want. We for free. It's no big deal.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 太棒了。我也会把它放在下面的描述里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Amazing. I'll put that in the description below as well.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是的。是的。人们会非常喜欢它。我认为他们会非常享受。所以，那是我们做的另一件事。但是现在，我们来谈谈半夜醒来，对吧？顺便说一句，您有这个问题吗？您以前发生过这种情况吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Yeah. Yeah. People will really dig it. I think they'll really enjoy it. So, that's another thing that we do. But now, let's talk about the middle of the night, right? So, by the way, do you have this as an issue? Have this has this happened to you before?

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 有时会发生，通常是当我的睡眠有些紊乱或被打断，或者当我真的有什么心事时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: It it happens sometimes and it's typically when like my sleep is somewhat disordered or disruptive or when there's really something on my mind.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是的。所以那种**预先焦虑**，比如在飞行前，如果我早上8点有航班，我前一晚会睡得很糟糕，因为我一直担心那个。对。但很多时候，人们通常会做的是，他们只是半夜醒来，无法再次入睡，他们真的不知道为什么。所以第一，这涉及生物学。所以您的**核心体温**会升高、升高、升高，当它达到峰值时，它会下降。这种下降是大脑释放**褪黑素**的信号。对吧？再次强调，这是启动睡眠引擎的关键。然而，您的**核心体温**会继续下降、下降、下降。顺便说一句，这就是我们告诉人们您应该在凉爽而不是温暖的环境中睡觉的原因。因为再次强调，您的**核心体温**正在下降。如果太热，您的**核心体温**就无法下降，您就无法入睡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Yes. So that that precipitatory anxiety like before a flight like if I have an 8:00 in the morning flight like I sleep like [ __ ] the night before because I'm constantly worried about that. Right. But a lot of times what people do normally is they just wake up in the middle of the night and they can't return to sleep and they're really not sure why. So number one there's biology involved. So your core body temperature rises rises rises and when it hits a peak it drops. That drop is then a signal to your brain to release melatonin. Right? Again, the key that starts the engine for sleep. However, your core body temperature continues to drop, drop, drop. By the way, this is the reason why we tell people you want to sleep in the cool, not the warm environment. Because again, your core body temperature is dropping. If it's too hot, your core body temperature can't go down and you can't get to sleep,

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 这与进化相符。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: which tracks with evolution.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 完全正确。所以，有趣的地方在于，它会一直下降、下降、下降，然后到某个时候，您的身体必须升温。如果它不升温，您就会**体温过低**。猜猜那是什么时候？凌晨1点到3点之间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Exactly. So, here's where it gets interesting is it keeps going, going, going, and then at some point in time, your body has to heat up. And if it doesn't heat up, you go hypothermic. Guess what time that is? Between 1 and 3 o'clock in the morning.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 哦，您的身体在1点到3点开始升温。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Oh, your body starts heating up at 1 1 and 3.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 地球上每个人的身体都会这样做。地球上每个人都会在凌晨1点到3点之间醒来。然而，大多数人会打个嗝，翻个身，舒服一下，然后在30秒内再次入睡。然而，有一小部分人最终成为我的病人，他们没有这种能力。问题就在这里。所以，以下是您半夜醒来时应该采取的步骤，以解决这个问题。所以第一，不要去小便。我知道，我知道，我知道人们会说：“什么？**迈克尔**，您在说什么？”所以，发生的情况是，当人们半夜醒来时，他们会对自己说：“嗯，我醒了。我不如去小便。”对吧？问题来了。记住我告诉过您，为了进入无意识状态，您需要**心率**达到60或以下，对吧？当您从躺着到坐着再到站立时，您的**心率**会发生什么变化？您走过房间，您的**心率**会立即上升。所以我们要做的是保持您的**心率**下降。所以，如果您真的不需要去洗手间，就不要去洗手间。75%的人侧卧睡觉，他们会蜷缩起来，这意味着他们会压迫膀胱。所以，我猜大多数人，如果您醒来时所做的只是躺下，然后仰卧大约25秒，看看您是否仍然需要小便。如果您不需要小便，就待在床上，保持您的**心率**下降。如果您需要小便，请去小便。对吧？如果您要去洗手间，在路上放置一个有策略的**夜灯**，这样您就不必打开洗手间的灯，因为如果您那样做，您就告诉您的大脑现在是早晨了，它就会停止产生**褪黑素**。但是假设您不需要小便。第二件事，不要看手机。现在，这对99%的人来说都非常困难，因为他们做的第一件事就是拿起手机去洗手间，对吧？他们要么查看电子邮件，要么看**Facebook**或**Twitter**，或者他们正在使用的任何社交媒体。

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Every single person's body on Earth does this. Everybody on Earth wakes up between 1 and 3:00 in the morning. However, most people burp, roll over, get comfortable, and fall back asleep in 30 seconds. However, there's a select group of people who end up being my patients who don't have that. And there here in lies the problem. So, here are the steps you want to take in the middle of the night to be able to solve this issue. So number one, don't go pee. I know, I know, I know people like, "What? What are you talking about, Michael?" So here's what ends up happening is when people wake up in the middle of the night, they say to themselves, "Well, I'm up. I might as well go pee." Right? Here's the problem. Remember I told you the big metric was in order to enter into a state of unconsciousness, you need a heart rate of 60 or below. Right? What do you think happens to your heart rate when you go from a lying position to a seated position to a standing position? You walk across the room, your heart rate goes straight up. So what we want to do is keep your heart rate down. So, if you don't really have to go to the bathroom, don't go to the bathroom. 75% of people sleep on their sides and they kind of squunch up, which means they're putting pressure on their bladder. So, my guess is is that most of those people, if all you did was when you woke up is lie and get on your back for about 25 seconds and see if you still need to pee. If you don't need to pee, stay in bed and keep your heart rate down. If you need to pee, please go pee. Right? If you're going to go to the bathroom, have a strategically placed nightlight along the way so you don't have to flip on the light in the water closet because if you do that, you just told your brain it's morning and it stops producing melatonin. But let's say you don't have to pee. The second thing, don't look at your phone. Now, this turns out to be very difficult for 99% of the people out there because the first thing they do is they grab their phone and they head to the bathroom, right? and they're either checking emails, looking at Facebook or Twitter or whatever social media they're on,

**Steven Bartlett**: 或者我们只是想知道现在几点了。

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 或者，问题就在于，一旦您看到时间，您就会立即进行心算，然后您就生气了，对吧？现在是凌晨3:30。我必须在6点起床。睡觉，睡觉，睡觉。您试图强迫您的大脑睡觉。伙计，在历史上，没有人能够强迫他们的大脑睡觉，好的？因为您的**心率**正在朝着错误的方向发展，对吧？它需要下降。所以，如果可以的话，不要看钟。好的，所以您没有小便，您没有看钟，但您仍然醒着，什么也没发生。这就是**呼吸技巧**发挥作用的地方。它叫做**478呼吸法**。我没有开发这个技巧。它是由**安德鲁·威尔德博士**开发的，他是一位**哈佛大学**培训的自然医生，非常聪明。他为军队开发了这个技巧，教他们在压力大的情况下如何降低**心率**。我们使用它是因为它有助于将我们的**心率**降低到60以下。而且它非常简单。我将让您尝试一下。所以，请坐直。好的。所以您要做的就是吸气数四下。您要屏住呼吸数七下。然后呼气数八下。我将引导您完成。我希望您闭上眼睛。我还希望您，通过鼻子吸气，通过嘴巴呼气。然后我还希望您在脑海中想象数字。所以当我说吸气二、三、四时，您应该在脑海中想象二、三、四。好的？

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: or and that's where the problem is is as soon as you see the time, you instantly do the mental math and now you're pissed off, right? It's 3:30 in the morning. I got to get up at 6:00. Sleep, sleep, sleep. And you try to force your brain to sleep. Dude, in the history of time, nobody has been able to force their brain to sleep, okay? Because your heart rate's going in the wrong way, right? It needs to be coming down. So, if you can, don't look at the clock. All right, so you haven't peed, you haven't looked at the clock, but you're still awake and nothing's going on. Here's where the breathing technique comes in. It's called 478 breathing. I did not develop this technique. It was developed by Dr. Andrew Wild, Harvard trained natural doctor, super smart dude. Um, and uh, he did it for the military to teach them how to lower their heart rate during stressful situations. We use it because it helps lower our heart rate past 60. And it's super simple. I'm going to get you to try it. So, go ahead and sit up straight. Okay. And so all you're going to do is breathe in for a count of four. You're going to hold for a count of seven. And you're going to breathe out for a count of eight. And I'm going to walk you through it. I want you to have your eyes closed. And what I also want you to do, you're going to go in through the nose, out through the mouth. And then what I also want you to do is picture the number in your head. So when I say breathe in two, three, four, you should picture the two, the three, the four in your mind's eye. Okay?

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 闭着眼睛。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: With my eyes closed.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 闭着眼睛。准备好了吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: With your eyes closed. You ready?

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 是的。吸气。2 3 4。屏住。2 3 4 5 6 7。呼气。2 3 4 5 6 7 8。很好。您要完成大约20个循环。它非常放松。我实际上在来这里做播客之前就做了这个，因为它有助于降低我的**心率**，让我集中注意力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Yep. Breathe in. 2 3 4. Hold. 2 3 4 5 6 7. Push. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. Good. You want to get through about 20 cycles of that. It's incredibly relaxing. I actually did it before I came out here to do the pod because it helps lower my heart rate and gets me centered.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 这相当了不起。现在，这个技巧有一些问题。第一，有时很难屏住呼吸七秒，有时很难呼气八秒。所以我告诉人们您可以做四、五、六，四、六、七，或者四、七、八。所以，慢慢来，对吧？如果屏住呼吸七秒太难，或者呼气八秒太难，您可以少做一点，直到您习惯了。然后另一个重要的事情是，很难弄清楚20个循环在哪里，因为您需要完成20个循环。所以我让人们做的是，在做这个的时候，握紧拳头。当他们完成一个循环时，他们伸出一根手指。再一个循环，伸出一根手指。不知不觉中，您就完成了10个。当您收回时，您就完成了20个循环。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: H. It's pretty remarkable. Now, there's some problems with the technique. Number one, sometimes it's hard to hold for seven, and sometimes it's really hard to push for eight. So, I tell people you can do this four, five, six, 4, 6, 7, or 478. So, just work your way up to it, right? If if it's too hard to hold your breath for 7 seconds or it's too too hard to push your breath for eight, you can do a little bit less just while you're getting used to it. And then the other big thing is it's hard to figure out where the 20 cycles is because you need to get to 20 cycles of this. So, what I have people do is take their hands and make light fists while they're doing this. And when they do one cycle, they put out a finger. Another cycle, put out a finger. And before you know it, you got 10. And when you bring it back, you've done 20 cycles.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 有趣的是。我刚做了两个，我就开始打哈欠了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: It's funny. I just did two and I start yawning.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 我知道。我刚看到了。我告诉您，伙计，这东西有效，对吧？所以，我让人们做这个技巧。最棒的部分是它避免了**猴子心**，对吧？那么，什么是**猴子心**？**猴子心**就是我在半夜毫无理由地思考一些我根本不应该思考的事情。比如购物清单上有什么，或者我对我的配偶说了什么，或者那个播客进行得顺利吗，或者任何可能在您脑海中浮现的事情？您不能同时数数和担心。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: I know. I just saw that. I'm telling you, dude, this thing works, right? And so, I have people do this technique. Here's the best part is it avoids monkey mind, right? So, what is monkey mind? Monkey mind is I'm thinking about stuff that I have no business thinking about in the middle of the night for absolutely no reason. Like what's on the grocery list or what did I say to my spouse or did that podcast go okay or any of the things that might be floating through your head? You cannot count and worry at the same time.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 为什么它有效？我的生理学发生了什么？嗯哼。您正在分散大脑对让您感到压力的事物的注意力，它正在降低您的**心率**，然后自然的睡眠过程就会随之而来。所以，所有这些都是分散注意力的技巧，明确地说。现在，有很多这样的技巧。我为我的一些病人使用的另一个技巧是，我告诉他们：“嘿，从300开始倒数，每次减3。”它在数学上如此复杂，您无法思考其他任何事情，而且它非常无聊。您会像灯一样熄灭。关于分散注意力这一点，很多人睡前会听播客或看电影。**杰克**刚才说，他需要听一些东西才能入睡。我也是。我听**连环杀手**之类的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: And why does it work? What's going on in my physiology? Uh-huh. You're distracting the brain from the thing that's stressing you out and it's lowering your heart rate and then the natural sleep process comes in after it. So, all these are are distraction techniques to be clear. Now, there's there's several of them out there. One of the other ones I use for some of my patients is I tell them, "Hey, count backwards from 300 by threes. It's mathematically so complicated you can't think of anything else and it's so damn boring. You're out like a light." On that point of distractions, a lot of people go to bed listening to podcasts or movies. Jack was just saying that, you know, he he needs to listen to something to fall asleep. I'm the same. I listen to like serial killer stuff,

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 很有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: which is, you know, that's interesting.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 别评判我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Don't don't judge me.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 等到我们谈到播客的梦境部分。我迫不及待地想听听您梦到了什么。我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Wait till we get to the dreams part of the podcast. I can't wait to hear what you dream about. I

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 我不知道，我总是在想为什么会这样。我的妹妹**阿曼达**也是一样，她听**连环杀手**的东西入睡。我想这是因为这只是一个假设。我妈妈总是让我放**法医档案**，那是一个关于**连环谋杀案**的纪录片，我们小时候她不会用遥控器。所以妈妈会把遥控器递给我，说：“放**法医档案**。”我就会给她调好频道，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: I don't I think I always try and figure out why it is. And I My sister's the same, my sister Amanda, and she she listens to serial killer stuff to fall asleep. I think it's because this is just hypothesis. My mom would always ask me to put on forensic files, which was this like serial murder documentary thing when we were younger cuz she couldn't use the remote. So my mom would say she'd pass me the remote, say, "Put on forensic files." And I'd like put on the number for her, right?

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 所以晚上我们家总是播放那个。我们卧室里都有电视，它们只是镜像楼下播放的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And so that was always playing in our house at night time. And we all had TVs in our bedroom that just mirrored what was ever what was playing downstairs, course.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 所以当我上床睡觉时，我会看电视入睡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: So when I got into bed, I'd watch fall asleep.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 这解释了您很多事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: This explains a lot about you.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 我知道，对吧？您对人们说这些，他们会觉得您是。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: I know, right? You say that to people, they think you're yours. Yeah.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 那么，让我告诉您我家里的情况。实际上，您和我有共同点。所以，在我家，我们有一个大屏幕电视。它整夜都开着。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So, let me tell you what it's like in my house. And actually, you and I have a commonality. So, in my house, we have a big screen TV. It's on all night long.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 在哪个房间？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Where? In which room?

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 在我的卧室里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: In my bedroom.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Okay.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 好的。当我遇到我的妻子时，她对我说：“**迈克尔**，如果您碰巧过夜，我想让您知道我睡觉时会开着电视。”我说：“别担心，**劳伦**。我将成为一名**睡眠医生**。我会解决这个问题的。”我们是在我30岁时认识的，所以我们认识了很长时间。您有没有尝试过改变您的床伴的某些习惯？是的，祝您好运。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Okay. When I met my wife, she said to me, "Michael, if you ever happen to spend the night, I want to let you know that I sleep with the television on." I said, "Don't worry about that, Lauren. I'm gonna be a sleep doctor. I'm gonna fix that." We we met when I was uh 30, so uh known her for quite a while. And uh you ever tried to change something in your bed partner? Yeah, good luck.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是的，祝您好运。所以我把电视拿走了。她说：“如果您还想再回到这里，我建议您把电视放回去。”然后我研究她，了解发生了什么。事实证明，她是在用我所说的“耳边余光”听电视。她的眼睛甚至没有睁开。一半时间是**宋飞正传**之类的剧集。我的妻子实际上喜欢**谋杀悬疑片**，所以通常是**法医档案**之类的东西。但对她来说，这是一个完美的分散注意力技巧。现在，我们卧室里还有第二件重要的事情，就是我们有两条狗。它们和我们一起睡在床上。我可是个该死的**睡眠医生**，伙计。这太疯狂了。但这里的重点是，睡眠是灵活的。好的？仅仅因为它对您有效，并不意味着它对您的床伴也有效。反之亦然，对吧？仅仅因为有些人不能开着电视睡觉，并不意味着开着电视会永远扰乱您的睡眠，因为它不会。顺便说一句，99%的电视都有内置定时器。如果您不知道那是什么，问问您的孩子。我不得不问我的儿子。他教我如何使用它。我们把它关掉了。这不是问题，对吧？所以，为自己和您的床伴创造一个有利于睡眠的睡眠环境，可以有很多变化。而且我认为人们没有一个硬性规定说：“嘿，没有人应该开着电视睡觉。”我的意思是，有些人会这么说，但坦率地说，每个人都开着电视睡觉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Yeah, good luck. So I took the TV out. She said, "If you ever want to come back in here again, I suggest you put the I put the TV back in." And then I studied her to learn what was going on. And it turns out that she's listening to it out of what I call the corner of her ear. Her eyes aren't even open. And half the time it's a episode of Seinfeld or something like that. My wife actually likes murder mysteries and so it's usually forensic files or something along those lines that's going on. But for her, it's a perfect distraction technique. Now, there's a second thing that's important uh in our bedroom that happens uh is we have two dogs. They sleep in the bed with us. I'm the freaking sleep doctor, dude. Like, it's insane. But the point here is sleep is flexible. Okay? Just because it works for you doesn't mean it works for your bed partner. And and vice versa is also true, right? Like just because some people can't sleep with the TV on doesn't mean that it's going to mess up your sleep forever to have the television on cuz it's not. And by the way, 99% of TVs have timers built into them. Like if you don't know what it is, ask your kid. I had to ask my son. He showed me how to use it. We turned it off. It wasn't a problem, right? So creating a sleep environment that is conducive to sleep for you and your bed partner can have a lot of variation to it. And I don't think people there's no hard and fast rule that says, "Hey, nobody should ever sleep with the TV on." I mean, there are people out there who say that, but quite frankly, everybody sleeps with the TV on.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 嗯，很多人都这样做。我不会在我们的卧室里开电视。我的意思是，我们做过一两次，因为我们在看东西，然后睡着了，我醒来时发现它开着，我就把它关掉了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Well, a lot of people do. I I I wouldn't put the TV on in our bedroom. I mean, we've done it once or twice or whatever, cuz we're watching something and we slip off to sleep and I wake up and I realize it's on and I turn it off.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 但我也真的认为这是一个重要的观点，就是人们会听像这样的播客。他们会听像**生物黑客**之类的东西，然后他们会变得如此严格地对待自己如何入睡，以至于会造成摩擦，因为伴侣不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: But I I also really think it's an important point to say that people will listen to podcasts like this. They'll listen to the like biohackers of the world and then they'll get so militant about how they fall asleep that it will cause friction because one partner is different.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 不要那样做。我在我的关系中遇到了这个问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Don't do that. And I had this problem in my relationship which was

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 我的女朋友在安静中睡觉，她做每件事都有一个光荣的例行公事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: my girlfriend sleeps in silence and is has like just such a glorious routine to everything she does.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 而我完全相反。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And I am completely the opposite

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 完全相反。我需要听**谋杀案**。我可能在看手机。就像当我查看我的**Whoop**分数时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: and the opposite like I need to like I want to listen to a murder. I could be on my phone. It's like when I look at my Whoop scores

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 对我有效。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: works for me.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Yeah.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 就像我正在获得，我睡得很好，即使我在听**连环杀手纪录片**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: It's like I am getting I have I get great sleep even if I'm listening to a serial killer documentary.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 所以。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: So

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 但如果您睡前吃饼干就不行了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: but not if you eat a cookie before bed.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 如果我吃饼干就不行。那就不行了。但我所做的是，我把一个**AirPod**放在我的右耳里。所以无论哪只耳朵不会放在枕头上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Not if I eat a cookie. That's that's gone. But I so what I do is I put one AirPod in in my right ear. So whichever ear is not going to be on the pillow

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 这意味着如果她说什么，我能听到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: and it means I can listen to her if she says something.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 但当安静时，我只听到我正在听的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: But when it's silence, all I hear is the thing that I'm listening to.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 所以我有一个诀窍给您。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So I've got a trick for you.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 我早上醒来，从床上找到掉落的**AirPod**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: And I wake up in the morning and dig the AirPod out of the bed where it ended up.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 对。所以现在我将帮助您解决挖**AirPod**的问题。所以首先，他们现在生产一种叫做**枕头音箱**的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Right. So now I'm going to help you with the digging of the AirPod. So first of all, they now make these things called pillow speakers.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 哦，有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Oh, interesting.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 对。所以它是一个**蓝牙音箱**，可以连接到您的手机，您可以把它滑到枕头下面，只有您能听到。所以，那是第一点。您可能想考虑一下。而且它们相当便宜。第二，他们现在专门生产用于睡觉的**耳塞**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Right. So it's a it's a it's a Bluetooth speaker that will attach to your phone that you can just slide and it's just under your pillow so only you can hear it. So, that's number one. You might want to consider that. And they're pretty inexpensive. Number two, they now make specifically earbuds designed to be slept in.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 哦，不错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Oh, nice.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 所以，有一家新公司叫做**Next Sense**。他们开发了一种**耳塞**，可以在您睡觉时实际测量您的**脑电波**。当您进入较浅的睡眠阶段时，它会发送一个频率信号，帮助您再次入睡或保持在那个睡眠深度。这是一家全新的公司。**Next Sense**。我与他们没有任何关系。我的意思是，这是一家我朋友拥有的公司，但我不在他们的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So, there's a a new company out called Next Sense. Um, and they have developed an earbud that actually measures your brain waves while you are sleeping. And when you move into a lighter stage of sleep, it sends in a frequency signal to help you go back to sleep or to stay in that depth of sleep. Brand new company. Next sense. I have nothing to do with them. I mean, it's a friend of mine who owns the company, but I'm not on their own.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 我想和他们有点关系。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: I would like something to do with them

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 我们会搞清楚的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: if we'll figure that out.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 那么，它也允许您播放音乐，或者您的播客，或者其他什么吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: So, does it allow you to play your music as well or your or your podcast or whatever?

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 我可以每晚听**CEO日记**入睡，它会确保我不会从任何梦境中醒来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: I can listen to Diary of a CEO every single night while I fall asleep and it will make sure that I don't wake up from any dreams.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 您仍然可以点赞和订阅之类的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: And you can still like and subscribe and stuff.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 当然，即使通过**耳塞**。我认为每个人都应该点赞和订阅。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Even through the earbuds, of course. I think everybody should like and subscribe.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 那是一个很好的功能，就像一个**AI代理**，帮助您订阅。好的，所以那是在半夜醒来。您没有小便。您没有看手机。您正在做这些**呼吸练习**。您没有给自己施加压力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: That's a good feature like an AI agent that helps you subscribe. Okay, so that's that's you woke up in the middle of the night. You don't pee. You don't check your phone. You're doing these breathing exercises. You don't give yourself a hard time.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 然后会发生什么？它不起作用。您该怎么办？是的。对。所以，有一种叫做**非睡眠深度休息**的新研究。我们称之为**瑜伽睡眠**。好的？它已经存在了几千年。当您像这样放松地躺着，像**尸体姿势**一样，您实际上正在做一些对您的睡眠有价值的事情。现在，我想明确一点。它与睡眠不同，但如果您躺在那里一个小时，就相当于20分钟的睡眠。所以每个人都应该知道，即使是放松和平静地躺着也非常有帮助，但如果您开始感到**焦虑**，您的**心率**开始加快，您就需要起床，因为那时您所做的只是认为这张床是让您感到**焦虑**和生气的地方。这不是睡觉的地方。所以只要您保持安静，**非睡眠深度休息**绝对是值得做的。我做的另一件大事是，顺便说一句，这偶尔也会发生在我身上，我不是免疫的，仅仅因为我是一名**睡眠医生**。您必须保持积极。我说的积极是什么意思？就是每个人在半夜醒来时，您的大脑都会倾向于消极。您凌晨3点起床，没有理由会发生什么好事，对吧？没有人会在凌晨3点进来祝您生日快乐。一定是发生了什么可怕的事情。您的大脑已经习惯了这一点。所以当它醒来时，它会立即转向消极，您开始思考不好的事情。您无法阻止您的第一个想法，但您可以阻止您的第二个想法，对吧？对吧？所以当您醒来并思考消极的事情时，我希望您用这个来代替：“好的，**迈克尔**，出于某种原因，您的身体决定在凌晨3点醒来，这不是我今晚想玩的游戏。然而，我想我会没事的。我只是躺在这里放松，让自然的睡眠过程接管。如果我感到**心率**加快，我就会去房子里的另一个房间，那里我已经准备好了一本书和一盏灯，这样我就可以稍微读一下书，然后回来睡觉。”我只是告诉自己，我允许自己放松，只是放松。然后您知道会发生什么吗？自然的睡眠过程就会到来。一旦您的**心率**开始下降，您的身体就想回到睡眠状态。所以这真的与**心率**有很大关系。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And then what happens? It doesn't work. What do you do? Yeah. Right. So, there's the new research on something called non-sleep deep rest. We call it yoga nidra. Okay? It's been around for thousands of years. When you lie relaxed in like a corpse pose like this, you're actually doing something that's valuable for your sleep. Now, I want to be clear. It's not the same as sleep, but if you lie there for an hour, it's like 20 minutes worth of sleep. So everybody should know that even lying relaxed and calm is very very helpful right but if you start to get anxious and your heart rate starts to tick up you need to get yourself out of bed because that's when because all you're doing then is thinking hey this bed is this place where I get anxious and pissed off. This is not a place to sleep. So as long as you stay nice and quiet the non-sleep deep rest absolutely the thing to do. The other big thing that I do and by the way this happens to me on occasion too like I'm not immune to it just because I'm a sleep doctor. You have to stay positive. And what I what do I mean by that is everybody when they wake up in the middle of the night, your brain is set to negativity. There's no reason you should be up at 3:00 in the morning that something good is going on, right? Nobody's coming in wishing you happy birthday at 3:00 in the morning. Something terrible has happened. And your brain has gotten accustomed to that. So when it wakes up, it immediately goes to the negative and you start thinking about bad things. You can't stop your first thought, but you can stop your second thought, right? Right? And so when you wake up and you think negative, what I want you to replace that with is, "Okay, Michael, for some reason, your body has decided to wake up at 3:00 in the morning, it's not the game that I wanted to be playing tonight. However, I think I'm going to be okay. I'm just going to lie here and relax and let the natural sleep process take over. If I feel my heart rate increasing, I'm going to go to another room in the house where I've already got a book and a light set up so I can do a little bit of light reading and then come back to sleep." And I just tell myself that I give myself permission to just chill, just relax. And then you know what happens? The natural sleep process comes over. As soon as your heart rate starts to go down, your body wants to get back to sleep. And so it really has a lot to do with heart rate.

### 全球睡眠危机与睡眠呼吸暂停

**Steven Bartlett**: 我喜欢在**Diio**上进行这些对话，因为我对那些睡眠不足的人充满了同情和担忧。我知道有很多人睡眠不足。我实际上认为，在某种程度上，这种情况正在增加，因为我们的生活方式。我查看了一些关于增长的统计数据，2025年和2026年初进行的一项研究显示，我们正处于一场**全球睡眠危机**中。

**Steven Bartlett**: I love having these conversations on the diio because I have a huge amount of sympathy and concern for people that don't get sufficient sleep. And I know there's a lot of people that don't. And I actually think it's to some degree it's somewhat increasing because of the way we live our lives. I was looking at some of the stats around the increase and there's a study done in 2025 and early 2026 that revealed we're in a global sleep crisis.

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 哦，是的，我们确实是。

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Correct. A 2026 survey by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine found that 93% of Gen Z admit to regularly losing sleep due to social media usage. And 71% of employed respondents globally have said that they sometimes call in sick at least once or twice due to poor sleep.

**Steven Bartlett**: 只是为了睡觉。是的。当我在**澳大利亚**工作时，很多**澳大利亚人**会休假，然后只是睡觉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Just to sleep. Yeah. When I was down in Australia doing some work down there, a lot of Australians they take holiday and they just sleep.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Yeah.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 只是为了补觉。这相当了不起。我们生活在一个非常睡眠不足的社会，我认为这有几个不同的原因。第一，您看到今天外面世界上正在发生什么了吗？外面相当疯狂。嗯，我能理解为什么人们会有点**焦虑**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Just to catch up. Like it's it's pretty remarkable. We're in a very sleep-d deprived society and I think there's a couple of different reasons why that is. Number one, have you seen what's going on outside in the world today? It's pretty crazy out there. Well, I can understand why people are getting a little anxious.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 我想可以说，历史上更疯狂，但我们从不知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: I think one could argue it's been crazier through history, but we never knew about it,

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 对吧？嗯，我的意思是，媒体如此迅速地向我们传递这些信息，我认为这绝对是您会同意的。在**第二次世界大战**期间，您知道，情况要疯狂得多。现在我们如此迅速地获得信息，人们对此如此紧张。我认为这与此有关。但如果我，我认为更大的罪魁祸首是人们**超重**。您知道，当您看**美国**，看**肥胖流行病**，看**超重**的人，大约有70%多的人**超重**。当您**超重**时，这会让您有可能患上**睡眠呼吸暂停**。现在，我想明确一点，不是每个患有**睡眠呼吸暂停**的人都**超重**，但很大一部分患有**睡眠呼吸暂停**的人体型较大。所以，当您看一个变得越来越大的社会，以及我们正在吃的所有不健康的食物，比如所有这些高度加工的食物，诸如此类，这些对任何人都没有帮助，它只会增加体重。具体来说，对于男性，我们会在脖子周围增重。我不知道您有没有注意到，但如果您曾经很胖然后减肥，人们说的第一件事是：“哦，您看起来瘦了，因为我能从您的脸上看出来，对吧？”他们会说：“哦，您的脖子看起来，您知道，现在不同了。”所以，我们从体重和食物的角度看到了世界上正在发生的事情，这可能是导致一些睡眠问题的原因。然后还有我之前提到的**焦虑**因素。我再次同意您的观点。我不认为我们有更多疯狂的事情发生。我认为我们知道更多正在发生的疯狂事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: right? Well, I mean, the media getting it to getting us this information so quickly, I think, is definitely what I would agree with you. It was much crazier during like World War II, you know, and stuff like that. Now we're getting information so quickly and people are getting so ratcheted up about it. I think that has something to do with it. But if I I think the bigger culprit is people being overweight. You know, when you look here in the United States and you look at the obesity epidemic and you look at people being overweight, it's something close to like 70s something percent of people in America are overweight. When you're overweight, that puts you in line for potentially having something called sleep apnea. Now, I want to be clear, not everybody with sleep apnea is overweight, but a a large percentage of the people with sleep apnnea are bigger people. And so, when you look at a society that's getting bigger and all the unhealthy food that we've got going on, like all this highly processed food, things of that nature, that isn't helping anybody, it's adding the pounds. And specifically, like for men, we gain weight through our necks. Like I I don't know if you've ever noticed it, but like if you ever were heavy and you lose weight, the first thing somebody says is, "Oh, it looks like you lost weight cuz I can tell from your face, right?" and they're like, "Oh, your neck looks, you know, different now." And so, we see a lot of what's going on in the world from a weight perspective and a food perspective could be driving some of the sleep problems. Then there's the anxiety perspective that I spoke of earlier that I think comes in. And again, I I agree with you. I don't think we have more crazy stuff going on. I think we know about more crazy stuff that's going on,

**Steven Bartlett**: 是的。那就会有问题，对吧？因为很多时候，顺便说一句，您需要在家里有隔断。比如，假设您住在一个**单身公寓**里，您的床就是您的沙发就是您的厨房，对吧？您没有专门的睡眠区域。您的身体需要知道，嘿，这是我可以放松并最终休息的地方。而且我认为很多时候我们的环境并不是那样的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Yeah. And and that becomes problematic, right? Because a lot of times also, by the way, you need to have dividers in your home. Like let's say you live in a studio apartment and your bed is your couch is your kitchen, right? You have no designated spot for sleep. Your body needs to know, hey, this is the spot where I can chill out and finally get some rest. And I think a lot of times our environments just aren't that way.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 我们应该从哪种**睡眠障碍**开始？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Which sleep disorder should we start with?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: **睡眠呼吸暂停**和**失眠**。对于那些可能不知道**睡眠呼吸暂停**是什么的人来说，它就是您晚上打鼾。几乎所有患有**睡眠呼吸暂停**的人都会打鼾。不是每个人，但几乎每个人都会。当您吸气时，您的舌头会向喉咙后部收缩，切断您的气流。您会真的停止呼吸几秒钟。然后突然您就会发出各种**咕噜声**、**呻吟声**，然后您就醒了。这种情况每晚可能发生数百次，而且问题非常严重，因为每次发生这些事件时，它都会把您吵醒，对吧？所以举个例子，我们测量每小时的事件次数。所以举个例子，患有**睡眠呼吸暂停**的人每小时可能会停止呼吸5到15次，这算是轻度的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Sleep apnea and insomnia. Sleep apnea, for folks out there who may not know what it is, is when you are snoring at night. Almost everybody who has sleep apnea snores. Not everybody, but almost everybody. And when you're sucking air in, you pull your tongue to the back of your throat and you cut off your air. And you literally stop breathing, right, for a few seconds. And then all a sudden you and you make all this kind of grunting, groaning noises. and then you wake up. This can happen hundreds of times a night and it can be very problematic because of course it wakes you up every single time that you have one of these events, right? And so as an example, we measure the events per hour. So as an example, somebody with sleep apnnea could have between five and 15 times per hour that they stop breathing and that's mild.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 那么他们如何才能进入清除大脑的深度睡眠呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So how are they going to get into the deep sleep that clears out their brain?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 那就是问题所在，对吧？所以**睡眠呼吸暂停**会阻止他们进入很多深度睡眠。所以他们的大脑无法清除，然后他们就有点麻烦了。所以归根结底，这里的目标是让尽可能多的人首先识别他们是否有**睡眠障碍**，然后能够尝试弄清楚该怎么做。在美国，未诊断的**睡眠呼吸暂停**患者比例相当高。大约在18%到20%之间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: That's the problem, right? And so apnea prevents them from getting into a lot of that deep sleep. And so their brain doesn't clear out and then they got they're they're kind of screwed. So at the end of the day, the the goal here is to get as many people to number one identify if they have a sleep disorder and then be able to try to figure out what to do about it. And the percentage of people in the US that have undiagnosed sleep apnea is pretty big. It's like somewhere between I think like 18 to 20%.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 这太疯狂了。我刚才正在看统计数据。它说根据2026年的数据，全球大约有9.36亿到10亿成年人患有**阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停**，这意味着每七个人中就有一个。

**Steven Bartlett**: 使其像**糖尿病**一样普遍。每七个听众中就有一个患有**睡眠呼吸暂停**。

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Yes.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 哇。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Wow.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 像**糖尿病**一样普遍。让这句话沉淀半秒钟。每个人都知道**糖尿病**是什么。几乎没有人知道**睡眠障碍**是什么。特别是**睡眠呼吸暂停**。它说80%到90%的这些人仍未被诊断。这是正确的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: As popular as diabetes. Let that sink in for like half a second. Everybody knows what diabetes is. Almost nobody knows what sleep disorders are. Specifically sleep apnnea. And it says 80 to 90% of those people remain undiagnosed. That is correct.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 所以现在有很多听众，实际上有很大一部分听众。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So there's people listening right there's actually a huge percentage of people listening right now

**Steven Bartlett**: 他们怎么会知道呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: How would they know?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 做**睡眠测试**。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Do the sleep test.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 这个东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: This thing here.

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Yeah.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 这会显示什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And what would this show?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 所以这会，这实际上会收集您整晚的**氧气水平**？您整晚的**心率**？您实际停止呼吸的次数？以及您的睡眠深度，您入睡时进入的睡眠阶段，诸如此类。这会显示什么？所以，您知道，因为人们会说：“我怎么知道我是否需要做测试？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: So this would this actually collects what is your oxygen levels throughout the night? What is your heart rate throughout the night? How many times do you actually stop breathing? And also the depth of your sleep, which stages of sleep you get when you fall asleep, things like that. And what would this So, you know, because people are going to be like, "How do I know if I need to do the test?"

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 真是个好问题。所以，您要考虑您可能有的症状。那么，您打鼾吗？您会喘着气醒来吗？有人告诉过您您的打鼾会短暂停止，或者他们听到您喘着气吗？您早上醒来时会头痛吗？您发现您的情绪起伏不定吗？所有这些都是**睡眠呼吸暂停**的迹象和症状。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So, great question. So, you want to think about the symptoms that you might have. So, do you snore? Do you wake up gasping for air? Has anybody told you that your snoring stops for brief periods of time or that they've heard you gasping for air? Do you wake up with a headache in the morning? Do you find your moods are up and down? All of those are signs and symptoms of sleep apnnea.

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 您与这家公司有任何关联吗？

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: So I' I'd put that there and like this.

**Steven Bartlett**: 是的。完全正确。就是这样。您上床睡觉，醒来，然后信息会传输到您的手机上，然后告诉我们到底发生了什么。现在，更棒的是。我知道，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Yeah. Exactly. And that's it. You go to bed, wake up, then the information ports over to your phone and then tells us exactly what's going on. Now, here's where it gets even better. I know, right?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 您能想象我带着我的未婚妻上床，然后说：“来吧，宝贝。让我们。”

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Can you imagine me getting in bed with my fiance and being like, "Come on, babe. Let's

**Steven Bartlett**: We're recording all kinds of good stuff. Who knows what she might like?

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 这会帮助我的性生活吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Is this going to help my sex life?"

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 绝对会，因为上床睡觉并了解您的睡眠质量，以及您是否有**睡眠呼吸暂停**，绝对会影响您的性生活。另外，顺便说一句，作为一名**睡眠医生**，我挽救的婚姻比作为一名婚姻治疗师处理半夜打鼾之类的事情要多得多。所以，您会感到惊讶。但它的好处是，它只需要一晚。您不必做很多晚。它非常简单。而且，再次强调，信不信由您，那是一次性的。您可以在所有事情结束后把它扔掉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: It's absolutely it will because getting into bed and knowing how well you sleep and knowing if you have sleep apnea or not will definitely affect your sex life. Also, by the way, I've saved more marriages as a sleep doctor than I ever would have as a marital therapist dealing with snoring in the middle of the night and things like that. So, you'd be you'd be surprised. But what's nice about this is it's one night. You don't have to do it multiple nights. It's super easy. Um, and again, believe it or not, that's disposable. You can actually throw that whole thing away after it's all said and done.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 在这一点上，在我们进一步深入**睡眠呼吸暂停**之前，我们应该和我们的伴侣一起睡在床上吗？我知道这是一个有趣的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: And on that point, before we just go a little bit further into sleep apnnea, should should we be sleeping in bed with our partners? And I know that's an interesting thing.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 好问题。好问题。您关系的强度与您在哪里睡觉无关。好的？所以，很多人会说：“我必须和我的伴侣一起睡，否则我的关系就会完蛋，一切都会变得很糟糕，我们永远不会有性生活，我们不是真的。”好的。所以，很多时候，对于我的一些病人，例如，他们患有**睡眠呼吸暂停**，他们使用一种叫做**CPAP呼吸机**的机器来帮助他们睡觉，对吧？而且，那种噪音对有些人来说可能会造成干扰，所以他们会睡在不同的房间里，对吧？那么，这会损害您的婚姻吗？不，不会。因为您可以这样做：周末在您的卧室里度假，对吧？我数不清有多少人在工作日分开睡觉，然后在周末一起睡觉。事实证明，他们在工作日睡得更好。然后您猜怎么着？周末的亲密关系来得更快，因为他们不那么累了。以前是：“今晚不行，我头痛。”现在是真的：“今晚不行，我太累了。”当您让您的伴侣在工作日获得良好的睡眠时，很有可能您在周末能够亲密，如果他们睡得好的话。所以，戴着那个上床睡觉可能不是世界上最性感的事情，但它总比患有**睡眠呼吸暂停**最终死亡要好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Great question. Great question. The strength of your relationship has nothing to do with where you sleep. Okay? So, lots of people are like, "I got to sleep with my partner otherwise my relationship's going to go to [ __ ] and everything's going to go terrible and we're never going to have sex and we're not true." Okay. So, a lot of times for people that I have, so for example, I've got people who um have sleep apnnea and they use a a machine to help them sleep called a CPAP machine, right? And um that noise for some people can be disruptive and so they sleep, let's say, in a different room, right? So, is that is that detrimental to your marriage? No, it's not. Because here's what you do is you vacation on the weekends in your bedroom, right? I can't count the number of people who sleep separately during the week and then together on the weekends. And it turns out that they get much better sleep during the week. And then guess what? Intimacy shows up much faster on the weekends because they're not so tired. Used to be, you know, not tonight I have a headache. It was really not tonight I'm exhausted. When you allow your partner to get good sleep during the week, there's a reasonably good shot that you're going to be able to be intimate over the weekend if they got good sleep. So, wearing that to bed might not be the sexiest thing in the universe, but it's better than having sleep apnnea and eventually ending up dead.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: **睡眠呼吸暂停**的症状对男性和女性来说不同吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Are the symptoms of sleep apnnea different for men and women?

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 是的。好问题。事实证明，男性和女性相当不同，但我们历史上一直以相同的方式对他们进行评分。所以女性倾向于不像男性那样打鼾。女性倾向于有更多的唤醒，她们会不断醒来。女性倾向于比男性更多地报告早上头痛。所以实际上，当涉及到**睡眠呼吸暂停**时，女性和男性的症状类型是不同的，以至于我们现在正在考虑使用不同的测试设备。所以这种测试设备不一定会测量**脑电图**，而在女性中，**脑电图**可能很重要。这就是我们正在学习的。所以，举个例子，我们公司正在寻找一种专门发送给女性的设备，这样我们就可以更准确地测量女性的**睡眠呼吸暂停**。现在，关于**睡眠呼吸暂停**的治疗有很多问题。没有人接受**睡眠测试**的最大原因是，他们害怕最终晚上要戴着**CPAP呼吸机**睡觉。所以，让我向您的听众描述一下那是什么。另外，完全披露，我患有**睡眠呼吸暂停**。我看起来不像患有**睡眠呼吸暂停**的人。我睡觉时会停止呼吸。我想是每小时26次。我知道，对吧？有点疯狂。我戴着**CPAP呼吸机**，它帮助我每晚睡觉。让我解释一下那是什么。所以，当您的喉咙在这里闭合时，**CPAP呼吸机**是一个小型的**空气压缩机**，带有一根管子和一个戴在您鼻子上的面罩，它会吹出一股细细的空气流，当它碰到那个阻塞时，它会轻轻地打开它，将空气直接射入您的肺部。现在，您可能会对自己说：“那听起来很野蛮。那太疯狂了。那就像一个**吹风机**整夜吹我的鼻子。”我能告诉您的是，当您患有严重的**睡眠呼吸暂停**时，这可以挽救生命。这可能是您能做的最重要的事情之一。现在，很多人说：“哦，我想我无法戴着面罩睡觉。”嗯，那不是唯一的治疗方法。还有其他治疗方法叫做**口腔矫治器**。这就像您看到足球运动员戴的**牙套**，但它有上下两部分。下部会慢慢地将您的下巴向前推，从而打开您的**后气道空间**。就像空气推开东西一样，**口腔矫治器**会结构性地将您的下巴稍微向前移动，从而打开您的气道。所以这很有效，而且您的脸上没有面罩。还有第三种设备，您可以戴在舌头上，它会振动，使您的舌头缩小几毫米，从而打开这个**后气道空间**，让您呼吸更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: They are. Great question. So, it turns out that men and women are quite different, but we've historically been scoring them the same. So women don't have a tendency to have as much snoring as men do. Um women have a tendency to have more arousals where they wake up constantly. Women have a tendency to report headaches in the morning more so than men do. So it's actually different types of symptoms for women versus men when it comes to sleep apnea to the point where we're now considering using different testing devices. So this testing device um would not necessarily measure EEG and in women EEG might be important. That's what we're learning. So, as an example, our company is finding a device specifically to send to women so that way we can more accurately measure sleep apnea in women. Now, there's a lot of questions about treatment for sleep apnea. And the biggest reason why nobody gets sleep tested is because they're afraid that they're going to end up sleeping with a CPAP machine on their face at night. And so, let me describe to your audience what that is. Also, full disclosure, I have sleep apnea. I don't look like somebody who has sleep apnea. I stop breathing in my sleep. I think it's 26 times an hour. I know, right? Kind of crazy. And I wear a CPAT machine and it helps me sleep every single night. Let me explain what it is. So, when your throat closes here, CPAT machine is a little air compressor with a tube and a mask that sits on your nose, pushes a just thin stream of just air, and when it hits that blockage, it ever so slightly opens it up, shoots air straight down to your lungs. Now, you might be saying to yourself, "That sounds barbaric. That is insane. That's a haird dryer blowing up my nose all night long. Here's what I can tell you is when you have a severe case of sleep apnea, this can be a lifesaver. This can be one of the biggest, most important things that you possibly do. Now, a lot of people say, "Oh, I don't think I could sleep with a mask on my face." Well, that's not the only treatment. There are other treatments called oral appliances. This is like a a mouthguard like you see the footballers wear, but it's an upper and a lower. and the lower slowly brings your jaw forward which opens up your posterior airway space. The same way that air pushes things aside, the oral appliance structurally moves your jaw slightly forward thereby opening up your airway. So that works well and there's no mask on your face. There's a third device that you can wear on your tongue that vibrates that shrinks your tongue by a couple of millimeters which opens up this posterior airway space and allows you to breathe better.

**Steven Bartlett**: I have as a matter of fact. And why did you choose the apnea machine?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 所以对我来说，**睡眠呼吸暂停机**效果最好，现在对我来说也最有意义。但说实话，我旅行时可能会使用**牙套**。有很多事情可以做。顺便说一句，还有手术，手术是一种更永久的解决方案。但是，在很多情况下，这些手术可以非常有效。另外，顺便说一句，他们正在研发一种治疗**睡眠呼吸暂停**的药丸。那只是**睡眠呼吸暂停**。我们甚至还没有谈到**失眠**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: So for me, the apnea machine worked the best and made the most sense for me right now. But I'll be honest with you, I will probably get the uh mouthguard for when I travel. There's a lot that can be done out there. And by the way, there's also surgeries and surgeries are a little bit more permanent fix. Um, but in many cases, those surgeries can be quite effective. Also, by the way, they're working on a pill for sleep apnnea now. And that's just apnea. We haven't even talked about insomnia yet.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 我刚才正在阅读关于**FDA**批准一种药物的消息。是的，这相当了不起。实际上有两家，我想实际上有三家不同的公司正在研发治疗**睡眠呼吸暂停**的不同药物。我的意思是，明确地说，当这种情况发生时，我认为**睡眠呼吸暂停**就差不多结束了，对吧？我的意思是，一旦我们能以药丸的形式获得它，这意味着依从性会大大提高，我们可以帮助很多人解决**睡眠呼吸暂停**问题，我认为这会非常棒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: I was just reading about the FDA approving a drug. Yeah, it's it's quite remarkable. And there's actually two I think there's actually three different companies that are working on different drugs right now for sleep apnea. And I mean to be clear, when that happens, I think it's pretty much game over for sleep apnea, right? I mean once we can get it in a pill form, which means compliance increases dramatically, we can help a lot of people with sleep apnea, which I think would be pretty amazing.

**Steven Bartlett**: 我想，您患**阿尔茨海默病**的几率会增加，对吧？因为您绝对患有**睡眠呼吸暂停**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: your chance of um getting Alzheimer's, I imagine, is going to increase, right? Because absolutely you have sleep apnnea.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是的。嗯，因为当您患有**睡眠呼吸暂停**时，它会阻止您进入深度睡眠阶段。深度睡眠阶段是**淋巴系统**进入并清除那些**蛋白质**的地方，这很可能是导致它的主要原因之一。所以这是我们一直希望人们理解的事情之一。但还有其他我认为重要的事情可能需要谈谈，那就是在另一方面，不是**睡眠呼吸暂停**方面，而是**失眠**方面，有很多人去药店购买非处方**安眠药**。现在我还没有谈到补充剂。如果您愿意，我们可以在一分钟内讨论补充剂，但我谈论的是像**PM药物**之类的东西，对吧？您知道，在美国，我们有**止痛药**加**PM**。所以有**泰诺PM**、**布洛芬PM**，它是一种**止痛药**，但他们添加了一种叫做**苯海拉明**的东西，它会让您感到困倦，让您入睡。**苯海拉明**实际上是一种**抗组胺药**，对吧？所以它用于**鼻塞**之类的。但现在有数据表明，长期使用这种药物的**PM部分**，而不是止痛部分，可能会直接导致**阿尔茨海默病**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Yeah. Well, because when you have sleep apnnea, it keeps you out of the deeper stages of sleep. the deeper stages of sleep is where that lymphatic system comes in and scoops out those proteins and that's really probably one of those big causes for it. So that's one of the things that we always want people to understand. But there's also something else that I think is important to maybe talk about which is on the other side not sleep apnnea side but on the insomnia side which is there's a lot of people who go and they go to the drugstore and they buy an over-the-counter sleep aid. Right now I'm not talking about supplementation yet. We can get into supplements in a minute if you want to, but I'm talking about things like the PM medications, right? You know, they so here in America, we have them where there's like there's like an analesic plus a PM. So there's Tylenol PM, Advil PM, and what it is is it's a pain reliever, but they add something called dyenhydramine and it makes you feel sleepy and it makes you fall asleep. Dyenhydramine is actually an antihistamine, right? So it's used for congestion and things like that. But there's now data to suggest that daily use of the PM part of this, not the pain relieving part, but the PM part can lead almost directly to Alzheimer's.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 哦，哇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Oh, wow.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 对。所以，如果人们能自然地入睡，遵循一些简单的规则，您会惊讶于您的世界会变得多么美好。**昆士兰大学**的**昆士兰脑研究所**发现，未经治疗的**睡眠呼吸暂停**患者患**阿尔茨海默病**的风险高出45%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Right. So, if people can just go to bed and follow a couple simple rules and go to bed naturally, you'd be shocked at how much better your world is going to be. The Queensland Brain Institute um at the University of Queensland found that people with untreated apnea have a 45% higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 就像我说的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Like I said,

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 这很疯狂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: which is crazy.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 所以，问题是，现在有很多正在看您节目的人。他们需要开始在脑海中思考，也许我患有**睡眠呼吸暂停**，也许没有，但也许我应该看看有哪些症状，看看这是否可能发生在我身上。因为再次强调，测试是可用的。明确地说，我不是唯一一个在那里测试人们的人。我的意思是，世界各地都有**睡眠医生**在测试人们。我鼓励人们，嘿，弄清楚它。如果您弄不清楚，您知道，给我们发电子邮件。我们会为您找到一个**睡眠中心**。但如果您认为有什么问题，那绝对值得检查，因为，顺便说一句，您可能一辈子都患有未诊断的**睡眠呼吸暂停**。它所做的只是基本上破坏体内的一切。那不是您想要的。记住，睡眠是恢复，对吧？这是您的身体仍然运作的方式。如果您想过上美好富裕的生活，您就需要睡觉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Soant here's the thing is we've got all these people who are watching your show right now. They need to start thinking in their head like maybe I have sleep apnea, maybe I don't, but maybe I should take a look at what are some of the symptoms and see if that's something that could be going on for me. Because again, testing is available. And to be clear, it's not like I'm the only guy out there testing people. I mean, there are sleep doctors all over the world that are testing people. My encouragement to people is, hey, figure it out. If if you can't figure it out, you know, shoot us an email. We'll find a sleep center for you to go to. But if you think there's something going on, it's definitely worth checking out because, by the way, you can stay with undiagnosed sleep apnnea for your entire life. And it all it does is basically break down everything that's going on inside. And that's not what you want. Like remember sleep is recovery, right? This is how your body still functions. Like if you want to lead a nice prosperous life, you want to sleep.

### 失眠与褪黑素的真相

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: **失眠**已经成为人们随口说出的一个词。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Insomnia has become a bit of a word that people throw around

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 当然。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: for sure,

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 对吧？他们有点自我诊断。我们有点把它看作是某一种特定的东西。我认为人们说“我**失眠**”时，他们只是睡不好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: right? They they kind of self diagnose themselves. We kind of think of it as this one specific thing. I think people say, "I have insomnia when they just don't sleep well."

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Right.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 什么是**失眠**，以及关于它的最大误区是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: What is insomnia and what's the big myth around it?

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 是的。所以，第一，**失眠**有几种不同的类型。有“我睡不着”的类型。有“我睡不稳”的类型，我们谈了很多。有“我醒得太早”的类型，然后还有“我醒来后感觉没有精神”的类型。所以，我们真的认为有四种**失眠**类型，对吧？而且，当人们，我想说很多人关于**失眠**的最大误区是，或者他们做的最大问题是，当一个人晚上睡得很糟糕时，他们第二天晚上会尝试早睡，试图补回一些他们错过的睡眠。所以明确地说，这是一个糟糕的主意，因为您的**昼夜节律**还没有准备好早睡。所以您躺在床上，您很累，但您睡不着。您处于我所说的“**疲惫而清醒**”的状态，对吧？所以我们希望人们做的是，如果您确实有**失眠**发作，即难以入睡或难以保持睡眠，第一，白天不要过度摄入**咖啡因**。很多人会说：“哦，我拖拖拉拉的。我得喝杯咖啡。”您知道，然后他们就不断地摄入**咖啡因**，然后他们摄入**咖啡因**太晚，导致他们晚上睡眠质量很差，现在我们就陷入了**洗衣机循环**，一遍又一遍。听起来您可能有点感同身受。所以我们想避免这种情况。我们想避免的另一件事是晚上过度刺激，对吧？所以很多人会感到那种**紧张的能量**，所以他们只是不断地做事情。再次强调，您需要跑道来降落飞机。所以给自己一些那样的空间。然后确保您有一定的规律性。对于我的**失眠**患者，但我坦率地说，对于任何正在观看此视频的人，我能给出的第一条睡眠建议是，每周七天都在同一时间醒来。而不是上床睡觉。我不太关心您什么时候上床睡觉。我知道有很多**睡眠专家**会说，您必须在同一时间上床睡觉和醒来。我不是那种人。我不太关心上床睡觉的时间。我只关心醒来的时间。让我解释一下原因。当您早上醒来时，阳光照射到您的眼睛，您的眼睛里有一种特殊的细胞叫做**黑视素细胞**，它会向您的大脑发送信号，关闭您头部的**褪黑素水龙头**。但它会设置一个精确的14小时计时器。这叫做**褪黑素相位响应曲线**。所以如果您早上6点醒来，**褪黑素**会关闭，直到晚上8点左右。然后它需要几个小时才能上升并起作用。所以您大约在9:30左右开始感到困倦，然后您上床睡觉。但如果您这样做，现在是周六，您睡到8点，**褪黑素**直到周六晚上10点才开始关闭。所以我的意思是，您醒来的时间直接决定了您体内**褪黑素**何时开始发挥作用。所以如果每个人每天都在同一时间醒来，每周七天，您就会自动在正确的时间感到疲倦，然后您就会开始睡觉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Yeah. So, number one, there's a couple of different flavors of insomnia. There's the I can't fall asleep. There's the I can't stay asleep, which we talked about quite a bit. There's the I wake up too early, and then there's just the I wake up from unrefreshing sleep. So, we really think that there are four sort of types of insomnia, right? And um when people I would say some of the biggest myths that a lot of people have surrounding insomnia is or like the biggest problem that they do is when somebody has a really crappy night then what they try to do is the next evening go to bed early and try to catch up on some of that sleep that they missed. So to be clear this is a terrible idea because your circadian rhythm isn't ready to go to bed early. So you lie in bed and you're exhausted but you can't fall asleep. you're what I call wired and tired, right? And so what we want people to do is if you do have a bout of insomnia where you have difficulty falling asleep or difficulty staying asleep, number one, don't overcaffeinate during the daytime. So many people are like, "Oh, I'm dragging. I got to get a coffee," you know, and and they and they caffeinate, caffeinate, caffeinate, and then they caffeinate so late into the day that they have shitty sleep that night, and now we're in the washing machine cycle going over and over and over. It sounds like you might be relating to this uh a little bit maybe yourself. And then so we want to avoid that. The other thing we want to avoid is over stimulation at night, right? So a lot of pimps people get that nervous energy and so they're just doing doing. Again, you need runway to land the plane. So give yourself some kind of that space. Um and then just make sure that you've got some level of regularity. I would argue for my insomnia patients, but quite honestly for anybody who's watching this, the number one sleep tip that I can give people is to wake up at the same time seven days a week. Not go to bed. I don't actually care when you go to bed that much. I know there's a lot of sleep specialists out there who are like, you got to go to bed at the same time and wake up at the same time. I'm not of that ilk. I don't really care that much about the going to bed time. I really only care about the wake up time. Let me explain why. When you wake up in the morning, sunlight hits your eye and you have a special cell in your eye called the melanopsin cell which sends a signal to your brain to turn off the melatonin faucet in your head. But it sets a timer for exactly 14 hours later. It's called the melatonin phase response curve. So if you're waking up at 6, melatonin turns off until about 8:00 p.m. Then it takes about a couple hours for it to get up and in. So then you start to get sleep around 9:30 and you go to bed. But if you did that and now it's Saturday and you sleep in until 8, melatonin doesn't kick off until 10:00 Saturday night. So what I'm saying is the time that you wake up directly determines when your internal melatonin kicks into gear. So if everybody woke up at the exact same time every single day, seven days a week, automatically you would get tired at the right time and you would start going to sleep.

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: **失眠**有两种不同的类型吗？有时我听到**原发性失眠**、**继发性失眠**。我想您的**YouTube**频道上有这个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: And is there two different types of insomnia? Sometimes I hear primary, secondary insomnia. I think you have that on your YouTube channel.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 所以当您看**原发性失眠**与**继发性失眠**时，我们分类的方式是，**继发性失眠**通常是由于您生活中正在发生的其他事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So when you look at primary insomnia versus secondary insomnia, the way we categorize that, secondary insomnia is usually due to something else that's going on in your life. So

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: **心理学**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: psychology,

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 所以可能是**咖啡因滥用**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: so maybe caffeine abuse.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 好的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Okay?

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 对吧？嗯，可能是类似的事情。而**原发性失眠**则没有其他原因。您唯一的问题就是**睡眠障碍**。**失眠**可能是**继发性**的另一个例子是**疼痛**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Right? Um maybe something along those lines. Whereas primary insomnia is there's nothing else. You the only thing you've got going on is sleep disorder. Another example of of something where insomnia might be secondary would be pain.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 对吧？所以如果您有**疼痛综合征**，如果您有**纤维肌痛**或**腰痛**，那可能会阻止您睡觉。那将是**继发性失眠**，继发于**疼痛**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Right? So if you have a pain syndrome, if you have fibromyalgia or low back pain, that could prevent you from sleeping. That would be secondary insomnia, secondary to pain.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 我听说**失眠**最常见的治疗方法是**CBT疗法**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And I hear that the most common treatment for insomnia is CBT therapy.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 所以，是也不是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: So yes and no.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Okay.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 所以我想说，**失眠**最常见的疗法是**酒精**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: So I would say that the most common therapy for insomnia is alcohol.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 喝**酒精**入睡的人比其他任何单一事物都多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: More people drink themselves to sleep than any other single thing out there.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 然后您就开始接触所有药物。有很多**药物**可供人们用于睡眠。我想强调一点，如果可以的话，就是需要药片才能入睡并没有错。好的？我想非常清楚这一点。有些人需要药片，对吧？各种各样的。谢谢。您和您的医生得出结论，**安眠药**对您有益，有很多原因。问题在于这些**安眠药**被过度开处方。所以**失眠**在睡眠界，我们称之为“**门把手诊断**”，因为当医生手握门把手即将离开时，病人会说：“哦，顺便说一句，我睡不着。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Um and then you start to get into the pharmacy of it all. And there's a lot of pharmaceutical drugs out there that people utilize for for sleep. And I want to make a point if I can is there's nothing wrong with needing a pill to sleep. Okay? I want to be very clear about this. There are people out there who need pills, right? All kinds of different ones. Thank you. There's a whole host of reasons why you and your doctor may have come to the conclusion that a sleeping tablet is good for you. The problem comes when those sleeping tablets are overprescribed. So insomnia is in the in the sleep world, we call it a door handle diagnosis because when the doctor has their hand on the door and they're just about to leave, that's when the patient says, "Oh, and by the way, I'm not sleeping."

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 然后医生通常会拿出**处方笺**，说，您知道，**安必恩**或**曲唑酮**之类的，写好，说：“拿去，30天后再回来。”嗯，您并没有真正为这个人做任何事情。您给了他们一颗药丸。顺便说一句，现在他们可能在心理上或生理上对这种药丸上瘾了。再次强调，如果您有严重的**精神健康问题**，我想我不在乎。我认为您可以服用您的**AMVN**并保持良好状态。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And then the doctor usually pulls out the prescription pad and says, you know, ambient or trazadone or something like that, writes it up, says, "Here, come back in 30 days." Well, you haven't really done anything for this person. You've handed them a pill. And by the way, now they're probably either psychologically or physiologically addicted to said pill right now. Once again, if you've got a major mental health issue, I don't think I care. I think it's okay for you to have your AMVN and be fine. And

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 很多患有**失眠**的人都患有**抑郁症**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: and a lot of people that do have insomnia have depression.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 哦，我认为这是我们看到的最大问题之一。但我会说**焦虑**可能比**抑郁症**更普遍。但是的，**焦虑**和**抑郁症**，我认为在任何给定时间都占**失眠**的75%。对吧？我与人们合作，我做一种叫做**失眠认知行为疗法**（CBTI）的事情，您正确地指出了这一点，对吧？所以我一直与病人合作。我们所做的正是重新安排他们的日程。所以那是行为部分。然后认知部分是，我们与他们谈论他们如何看待睡眠？因为很多人以灾难性的方式看待睡眠。他们会说，如果我睡不到八小时，我的一天就完蛋了，一切都会发生。这种情况很少发生。这叫做**灾难化**。您只会让事情变得越来越糟。所以我们审视那些**认知扭曲**，并在治疗中帮助纠正它们，通过我所说的“**做数学**”。所以我说：“嗯，您有没有睡过四个小时？”“有。”“您第二天做了什么可怕的事情吗？”“没有。”“那么您的证据在哪里？”对吧？您开始让人们挑战自己，然后突然他们就能达到那种状态。还有另一个领域，很多人会介于药片和疗法之间，那就是**补充剂**。所以有很多喜欢使用**补充剂**并试图理解如何通过**补充剂**来“治疗”**失眠**的人。所以，如果我们能，我们来谈谈**补充剂**，以及哪些是好的，哪些是坏的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Oh, I think it's one of the biggest things that we see. But I would argue anxiety might be a little bit more than depression. But yes, anxiety and depression, I would argue, make up 75% of insomnia at any given time. Right? I work with people and I do something called cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia which you correctly identified as CBTI, right? And so I work with patients all the time. Um, and that's exactly what we do is we reschedule them. So that's the behavioral part. And then the cognitive part is we talk to them about how do you think about sleep? Because a lot of people think about sleep in disastrous ways. They're like, if I don't get eight hours, my old day is screwed and everything's going to happen. It rarely happens that way. Like it's called catastrophizing. You just make it worse and worse and worse. And so we look at those cognitive distortions and we help fix them in therapy by really kind of what I call doing the math. And so I say, "Well, have you ever had four hours of sleep?" "Yes." "Did you do something terrible the next day?" "No." "So where's your evidence?" Right? And you start to get people to challenge themselves and all of a sudden they kind of they can kind of get there. There's also another area of that a lot of people go to somewhere in between the pills and therapy, and that's supplementation. So there's a lot of people out there who like to use supplements and try to understand how to fix quote their insomnia with supplementation. So if we can let's talk a little bit about supplements and sort of what's good and what's bad.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: **补充剂**和药丸有什么区别？或者您在这里说的是同一件事吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: What is the difference between a supplement and a pill or is it you talking about the same thing here?

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 所以在这次对话的背景下，**补充剂**是您可以在任何药店购买的非**FDA**监管的东西，而药丸是医生开的处方药。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So under the context of this conversation, a supplement is a non FDA regulated thing that you can purchase at any drugstore and a pill is a by prescription only from a doctor.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Okay,

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 这就是我们对这次特定对话进行区分的方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: that's how we're going to make the distinction for this particular conversation.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 好的，那么您面前的那些药丸。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Okay, so those pills that are in front of you there,

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 所以在我面前的这些，这些实际上都是**补充剂**。所以这些是不同的。所以这些不是**药物**。这些是不同的东西。所以，我们有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: so right in front of me, these are most these are actually all supplements. So these are different. So these are not pharmaceuticals. These are different things. So, we've got

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 我的意思是，在不同的国家，情况不同，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: I mean, in different countries, it's different, right?

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 很好的观点。那么，我们来谈谈**褪黑素**，因为那是很多人想了解的大问题。所以，第一，除了**美国**，**褪黑素**几乎在所有地方都只能凭处方购买，对吧？所以，在**英国**、**澳大利亚**、**欧洲**，您不能随便走进药店购买**褪黑素**。这有一个原因。很多人没有意识到，但**褪黑素**是一种**荷尔蒙**。您不能去**CVS**购买**睾酮**和**雌激素**，对吧？因为**荷尔蒙**会影响整个系统。它们会影响您体内几乎300种不同的东西。所以您不想让随便一个人随便拿一个**荷尔蒙**就开始服用，而没有人了解他们的情况。更重要的是，特别是**褪黑素**，以及我之前想提出的关于**抑郁症**的观点，**褪黑素**会与所有**SSRI药物**相互作用。**SSRI**是**选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂**，一种**抗抑郁药**。所以像**百忧解**、**左洛复**、**西酞普兰**，所有这些药物都会受到**褪黑素**摄入的影响，而没有人知道这一点。此外，**褪黑素**会影响**避孕药**。是的，您在这里听到了，**避孕药**。它会影响**血压药物**，它会影响**糖尿病药物**。所以，问题之一是人们走进当地药店，他们会说：“哦，我要买一些**褪黑素**，我要改善我的睡眠，因为我睡得很差。”所以，首先，**褪黑素**不是那样运作的。**褪黑素**是**睡眠调节剂**，而不是**睡眠启动剂**。**褪黑素**不影响**睡眠驱动**。**褪黑素**影响**睡眠节律**。所以，记住在我们对话的开始，我们谈论了两个系统。**褪黑素**只影响您的大脑告诉它何时该睡觉。它不会让您感到困倦。那是**腺苷**。我们已经谈过**腺苷**和**咖啡因**以及它们的分子结构有多么相似。所以当您看像**褪黑素**这样的东西时，您需要非常谨慎地使用它。第二，**褪黑素**不应该用于儿童。好的？所以很多人会说：“**迈克尔**，全国各地的儿科医生都告诉我给我的孩子服用**褪黑素**。”我将在这里当着大家的面说。那是我很长时间以来听到的最愚蠢的想法，因为您刚刚教您的孩子他们需要药片才能睡觉。通常，没有孩子需要药片才能睡觉。顺便说一句，大多数孩子产生的**褪黑素**量几乎是他们大脑所需量的四倍。所以，给他们额外的**褪黑素**对您没有任何好处。然而，有一组儿童，**褪黑素**确实有效，那就是**自闭症谱系**的孩子。我们不确切知道为什么，但至少我不知道，但有数据表明，服用五、六、七毫克对他们非常有帮助。剂量也是一个问题，比如如果您去药店，您几乎找不到适当的剂量。适当的剂量大约在半毫克到一毫克半之间。最多三毫克，但那已经是您想达到的最高剂量了。但当您去**CVS**时，您会发现10毫克和20毫克的**软糖**。人们总是告诉我：“哦，我不能服用**褪黑素**。它会让我做奇怪的梦。”过量服用**褪黑素**的头号副作用就是**奇怪的梦**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Great point. So, let's talk about melatonin since that's kind of the biggie that a lot of people like to know about. So, number one, melatonin is by prescription only almost everywhere other than the United States, right? So, in England, in Australia, in Europe, you can't just walk into the drugstore and buy melatonin. And there's a reason. A lot of people don't realize it, but melatonin is a hormone. There's a reason you can't go to the CVS and get testosterone and estrogen, right? Because hormones affect the entire system. They affect all three almost 300 different things in your body. So what you don't want to do is have somebody just willy-nilly grabbing a hormone and starting to pop it without somebody understanding what's going on with them. More importantly, melatonin in particular, and the point I wanted to make earlier about depression, melatonin interacts with all SSRI medication. An SSRI is a serotonin specific reuptake inhibitor, an anti-depressant. So things like Prozac, Zoloft, um, Selelexa, all of those are medications that will be affected by melatonin ingestion and nobody knows that it is. In addition, melatonin affects birth control. Yes, you heard it here, birth control. It affects blood pressure medication and it affects diabetes medication. So, one of the problems is that people go into the local drugstore and they're like, "Oh, I'm going to grab some melatonin and I'm going to make my sleep better because I'm sleeping poorly." So, first of all, that's not what melatonin does. Melatonin is a sleep regulator, not a sleep initiator. Melatonin doesn't affect sleep drive. Melatonin affects sleep rhythm. So, remember in the beginning of our conversation, we're talking about the two systems. Melatonin only affects your brain telling it when it's time to go to bed. It does not make you sleepy. That's a denisonin. We already talked about adenosin and caffeine and how similar their molecular structures are. So when you look at something like melatonin, you need to really be thoughtful about using it. Number two, melatonin is not to be used in children. Okay? So a lot of people are like, "Michael, I've got pediatricians all over the country telling my telling me to give my children melatonin." I'm going to say it right here in front of everybody. That is the dumbest idea I have heard in a long time because you just taught your child that they need a pill to sleep. Normally, no child needs pills to sleep. And by the way, most children make almost four times the amount of melatonin that their brain even needs. So, giving them extra melatonin doesn't do you any good. There is, however, one group of children where melatonin does work well, and that's in kids on the autism spectrum. um we don't know exactly why but um or at least I don't but there is data to suggest that at five six seven milligrams that that can be very helpful for them. Dosage also is a problem like if you go to the drugstore you can you almost can't find it in the appropriate dose. The appropriate dose is anywhere from about half a milligram to one and a half milligrams. Maybe top out at three but that's about as high as you want to go. But when you go to CVS you find a gummies in 10 and 20 milligrams. And people tell me all the time, "Oh, I can't take melatonin. It gives me crazy dreams." Number one side effect of overdosing on melatonin is crazy dreams.

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: On this point of going to a supermarket and picking some melatonin off the shelf,

**Steven Bartlett**: FDA approval and the lack of FDA approval in melatonin means that there's less clarity on what's actually in there. Right.

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 非常非常不同的东西。他们对市售的儿童**褪黑素软糖**进行了分析，发现实际的**褪黑素**含量从0%到标签上所列的667%不等。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Very very different things. They looked at an analysis of melatonin gummies marketed for children and found that the actual amount of melatonin ranged from 0% to 667% of what was listed on the label.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: right

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 在同一项研究中，一些**褪黑素软糖**根本不含**褪黑素**，而另一些则含有**CBD**等危险污染物，但标签上并未披露。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Yep. See it all the time. And in the same study, melatonin gummies, some melatonin gummies contained absolutely no melatonin, while others contained hazardous contaminants like CBD that were not disclosed on the label.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Yep.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 因为**褪黑素**在美国作为**补充剂**而非药物出售，**FDA**在它上架前不对其安全性或准确性进行测试。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Because melatonin is sold as a supplement in the US and not a drug, the FDA does not test it for safety or accuracy before it hits the shelf.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 您100%正确。那是一个巨大的问题。您就想一想。我的意思是，**褪黑素**的市场是巨大的。在**补充剂**世界中它是巨大的。然而，没有任何监管。没有人知道这些相互作用效应，它们非常非常大。顺便说一句，大多数人都在错误地使用它。实际上只有三到四种情况下**褪黑素**会有用。我会用**褪黑素**来治疗**时差**，我们应该谈谈**时差**。我会用**褪黑素**来治疗**轮班工人**，对吧？所以对于那些工作**夜班**，白天必须睡觉的人，他们是使用**褪黑素**的绝佳人选。**褪黑素缺乏**的人。很多人没有想到这一点，但大约在50岁左右，如果您要出现**褪黑素缺乏**，我们就会开始看到这种情况发生在人们身上，他们产生**褪黑素**的能力开始下降。所以，我认为这三种情况绝对应该使用**褪黑素**。信不信由您，有一些数据表明，在**ADD**和**ADHD**中，**褪黑素**有一些用途，然后也用于一种非常特定的**睡眠障碍**，叫做**快速眼动行为障碍**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: You are 100% correct. And that's a huge problem. Just think about that for a second. I mean, the market for melatonin is tremendous. It's huge in the supplement world. Yet, there's no regulation. whatsoever. Nobody knows about these interaction effects which are big, big, big. And by the way, most people are using it wrong. There's really only three maybe four different instances when melatonin would be useful. I would use melatonin for jet lag, and we should talk about jet lag. Um I I would use uh melatonin for shift workers, right? So for people who work, you know, night shift who have to sleep during the daytime, they would be excellent people to use melatonin. people with a melatonin deficiency. A lot of people don't think about that, but right around age 50 is when if you're going to have a melatonin deficiency, we start to see that happening for people is it their the ability to produce melatonin begins to decline. So, I think those three situations absolutely would be on board for melatonin. Believe it or not, there's some data to show that in ADD and ADHD there's uh some use for melatonin and then also for a very specific sleeping disorder called REM behavior disorder.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 我们社会对**褪黑素**简直是痴迷，不是吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: We're going melatonin crazy as a society, aren't we?

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 绝对是。我们不需要它。它完全没有必要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Absolutely. We don't need it. It's completely unnecessary.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 我查看了数据。1999年，0.4%的**美国人**表示他们使用**褪黑素**。今天，这个数字几乎是30%。所以，7000万**美国人**，伙计。那是有问题的。而且，他们再次不知道它对他们做了什么，对吧？他们还把它给他们的孩子。我想不出有什么比给一个年轻女性发育中的身体添加**避孕药**更糟糕的事情，当它没有必要时。我的意思是，这对我来说毫无意义。儿童因过量服用**睡眠软糖**而中毒的案例是**毒物控制数据**中增长最快的趋势。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: I was looking at the data. In 1999, 0.4% of Americans said they used melatonin. Today, it's almost 30%. So, 70 million Americans up, dude. That is problematic. And again, they have no idea what it's doing to them, right? And they're giving it to their kids. Like, I can't think of anything worse for a young female developing body than to add a contraceptive when it's not necessary. Like, it just doesn't make sense to me. The rise in children overdosing on sleep gummies is the fastest growing trend in poison control data.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 是的，我想大概增加了600%左右，或者类似这样疯狂的数字，对于那些过量服用**褪黑素**的孩子。大约一年前，一年半前，有一项研究表明，儿童过量服用**褪黑素**的案例增加了近600%。当您开始思考时，这相当糟糕。问题是，孩子们知道如何睡觉，对吧？您只需要停止。您只需要让他们睡觉，对吧？您需要给他们一些参数。这是您睡觉的时间。这是您醒来的时间。不要起床。您知道，不要进来要12杯水。您知道，所有这些事情。我的意思是，这并不难。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Yeah, I think it's like almost 600% increase or something crazy like that for kids who have uh gotten uh who've overdosed on melatonin like within there was a study that came out maybe a year ago, year and a half ago showed like almost 600% of uh increase in uh overdoses for kids. Like that's pretty messed up when you start to think about it. And here's the thing, kids know how to sleep, right? You just got to stop. You just got to let them sleep, right? You got to give them some parameters. Here's when you go to bed. Here's when you wake up. Don't get out of bed. You know, don't come in and ask for 12 glasses of water. You know, all the all the stuff that goes on there. I mean, it it this isn't hard.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 那么，何时以及如何？我一生中只使用过一次**褪黑素**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: So, when and how So, I used melatonin once in my life.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Okay.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 说实话，它确实有效。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: And I got to be honest, it [ __ ] worked.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 是的。哦，如果您使用得当，它就有效，兄弟。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Yeah. Oh, if you use it right, it works, bro.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 实际上大约一周前，因为我一直饱受**时差**的困扰。我从**英国**飞到**洛杉矶**，再到**英国**，再到**洛杉矶**，再到**开普敦**，再到**中东**，再到其他地方，我每晚都凌晨4点或5点才上床睡觉，但仍然必须在10点左右醒来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: And it was it was actually about a week ago because I'd been struggling with lots of jet lag. I'd flown from the UK to the LA to UK to LA to Cape Town to Middle East to wherever and I was getting to bed every night at like 4:00 or 5 a.m. and still waking up at, you know, having to wake up at about 10:00.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 所以，我想，我需要纠正这个问题。它已经持续了两周，我需要纠正它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So, I thought, I need to correct this. It's been going for two weeks and I need to correct this.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 绝对是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Absolutely.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 所以，我想，管他呢，我要屈服了。我服用了**褪黑素**，然后纠正了它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So, I thought, [ __ ] it, I'm going to cave. I g I took the melatonin and corrected it.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是的，它有效。那么，我们来谈谈**时差**。这有点像一个故事，但我参与了一家公司，他们有一个应用程序，这很有趣。好的。我没有任何，我没有投资这家公司，明确地说，但它是我一个亲密的朋友开发的。所以，我有点**太空迷**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Yes, it does. So, let's talk about jet lag. So, it's a bit of a story, but I got involved with a company that um has got an app, which is very interesting. Okay. Um I don't have any like I'm not invested in the company, just to be clear, but it's one of my close friends who developed this. So, I'm kind of a space nerd.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 不是**Time Shifter**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: It's not Time Shifter.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是**Time Shifter**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: It is Time Shifter.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 哦，真的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Oh, really?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: It is.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 我也喜欢与**Time Shifter**有联系。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: I also like an affiliation with Time Shifter

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 因为我以前。是的，我会给您那个。所以，有趣的是，整个**Time Shifter**的运作方式是，您也是个**太空迷**吗？您不是吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: because I used to Yeah, I will get you that. So, here's what's fascinating is the way the whole time shifter started was um so aren't you kind of a space guy? Like, aren't you

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 我是**SpaceX**的投资者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: I'm an investor in SpaceX and

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 好的。所以，我自己也是个**太空迷**，对吧？所以，您知道，**国际空间站**以每小时17500英里的速度绕地球运行。它在高速飞行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Okay. So, I'm a space nerd myself, right? So, you know, the the ISS is moving around at 17,500 miles an hour around the Earth. It's cooking.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: **国际空间站**。它在快速移动，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: ISS meaning the International Space Station. It's whipping around, right?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 您能想象他们一天能看到多少次日出和日落吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Can you imagine how many sunrises and sunsets they get in a given day?

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 哦，不。多少次？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Oh, no. How many?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 每两个小时。所以，他们基本上能看到12次。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Every two hours. So, they basically get 12.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 哇。想想他们的**昼夜节律**会因为看到日出日落而变得多么紊乱。它真的会变得非常紊乱，对吧？顺便说一句，您不想在**空间站**犯大错。比如您不想把**气闸**开着，您知道，或者类似的事情。那样事情会变得非常非常糟糕。所以他们打电话给**NASA**，他们说：“嘿，我们这里有问题。每个人都想同时使用实验室，人们看到太阳。怎么回事？”所以他们打电话给我一个在**哈佛大学**的朋友，名叫**史蒂文·拉克利**。**史蒂文**可以说是世界上最好的**昼夜节律研究员**之一。他非常聪明，他说：“嗯，我们送一套照明设备上去，在**空间站**上创建班次。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Wow. Think about how messed up their circadian rhythms would be from seeing the sunrise and seeing it go and see it gets really messed up, right? And by the way, you don't want to make big mistakes in the space station. Like you don't leave the air lock open, you know, or [ __ ] like that. Like that's when things get really really bad. So they called down to NASA and they were like, "Hey, we got a problem up here. Everybody wants to use the lab at the same time like people seeing the sun. Like what's going on?" So they called a buddy of mine named Steven Lachley over at Harvard. Stephen is arguably the one of the best circadian researchers in the world. um super smart dude and he was like, "Well, let's send up a lighting kit and let's create ships on the space station."

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 嗯哼。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Mhm.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 对。所以他们就是这样做的。他们送了一套照明设备上去。我想是在**哥伦比亚号航天飞机**退役之前。他们设置了照明，然后设置了照明时间。所以宇航员有早班、中班和夜班。一旦他们让算法运作起来，他们就把它带到地球上，并将其应用于**梅赛德斯-奔驰F1赛车队**。所以他们把它给了**刘易斯·汉密尔顿**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Right. So that's exactly what they did. So they sent up a lighting kit. I think it was on the Colombia um shuttle before it got decommissioned. And they set up lighting and then they set up timing for lighting. And so there was a morning shift, a midshift, and a night shift for the astronauts. Once they got the algorithm working, they brought it down terrestrially and they put it into the Mercedes-Benz uh Formula 1 race car team. So they gave it to Lewis Hamilton.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 嗯哼。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Mhm.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 对。因为当您想到它时，想想他必须做什么，对吧？他以百分之一秒的差距登上或离开领奖台，对吧？而且他每三周就在一个不同的国家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Right. Because when you think about it, think about what he has to do, right? He's on or off the podium on hundreds of a second, right? And he's in a different country every 3 weeks,

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 对吧？所以这个人有您难以置信的**时差**。所以一旦我们让它运作起来，我们就创建了**Time Shifter**应用程序。所以它是一个应用程序，您可以在手机上下载。您输入您的航班号，它会自动调出航班并知道您在哪里。这就是为什么我认为**时差**是一个数学问题。让我解释一下。我们大约20年前了解到，当您以某种频率和强度照射光线到某人的眼睛时，如果您愿意，您可以将他们的**昼夜节律**移动大约八小时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: right? So this guy's got jet lag like you wouldn't believe. And so once we were able to get it going there, then we created the time shifter app. And so it's an app you can get it on your phone. And what you do is you put in your flight number and it automatically pulls up the flight and knows where you are. This is why I think that jet lag is a math problem. Let me explain. We learned about 20 years ago that when you take a certain frequency and intensity of light and you shine it in somebody's eyes, you can move their circadian rhythm by about eight hours if you want to.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 那个**昼夜节律**再次是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: That circadian rhythm again being

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 那个内部的生物钟，您的身体想睡觉和想醒来的时间。我们实际上可以通过大约10000勒克斯的**蓝光**亮度水平，特定频率的光线，将其移动大约8小时。好的？所以当您达到那个，如果您从**洛杉矶**出发，您要去**曼彻斯特**，对吧？而且有很大的时差，您知道**洛杉矶**的时间，您知道**曼彻斯特**的时间，这是一个关于您何时获得光线的数学问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: being that internal biological clock, the time when your body wants to go to bed and wants to wake up. We can actually move that by about 8 hours with about 10,000 lux, which is the brightness level of blue light, particular frequency of light. Okay? So when you hit that, if you start in LA and you're going to Manchester, right, and there's a big time difference and you know what time it is in LA and you know what time it is in Manchester, it's a math problem of when do you get the light.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 所以**Time Shifter**就是这样，它决定了您何时需要光线，然后在您不需要光线的时候，它会让您使用**咖啡因**，对吧？或者让您保持清醒，或者如果到了睡觉时间，您就使用一点**褪黑素**。那时**褪黑素**变得如此有价值。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So that's what time shifter is, is it determines when do you need that light and then on the times when you don't need light, it has you use caffeine, right? Or to keep you awake or if it's time to sleep, then you use a little bit of melatonin. That's when melatonin becomes so valuable.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 它还会告诉您什么时候吃饭。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: It also tells you when to eat.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 是的。它会告诉您所有这些不同的事情。而且它很不错，因为它会在您的手机上显示出来。它会说：“嘿，那时做这个。那时做那个。”它真的非常有效。但是，是的，**Time Shifter**是我的最爱之一。我实际上已经使用了15年了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: It does. It tells you all of these different things. And it's kind of nice because it kind of shows up on your phone. It's like, "Hey, do this then. Do this then." And it works really, really well. But yeah, Time Shifter is one of my favorites. Uh I've been uh using it literally for 15 years.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 哇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Wow.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 它解决了**时差**问题，兄弟。我们会为您解决这个问题。毫无疑问。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And it solves jet lag, bro. Like we're going to fix that for you. No, no question.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 一个人应该多久服用一次**褪黑素**？有没有服用太频繁的情况？因为有些人每天都服用。是的，我认为那是个坏主意。所以，如果您有**褪黑素缺乏症**，当然，每天服用。但是，嗯，或者如果您是**轮班工人**，可能。但我自己只在**时差**时使用它。否则，我不会经常使用它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: How often should someone be having melatonin? Is there like too often? Because some people literally have it every day. Yeah, I would argue it's a bad idea. So, if you have a melatonin deficiency, sure, have it every day. But, um, or if you're a shift worker, probably. But I I use it only for jet lag myself. Otherwise, I'm not using it on the regular.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 每天服用有什么风险？是吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: And what's the risk there of having it every day? Is it?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 嗯，这是个好问题。所以，当您开始研究**褪黑素过量**以及长期服用**褪黑素**时，研究中存在一些争议。有一组人说，如果您长期服用**褪黑素**，您的身体就会停止产生它。另一组人研究了研究，并说实际上并非如此。所以，现在我们有大约一年左右的**褪黑素**研究。当您在他们服用**褪黑素**一年后停止其**褪黑素**产生时，他们的身体似乎能毫无问题地重新开始产生。这与**睾酮**不同，对吧？所以对于**睾酮**，我们知道当男性开始服用**睾酮**时，他们的身体实际上会停止产生它。对于**褪黑素**，似乎并非如此，但我们没有超过一年以上的研究。所以如果有人每天服用**褪黑素**5到10年，您知道，您就会开始怀疑会发生什么。另外，别忘了，那种**褪黑素**与您大脑中实际产生的**褪黑素**是不同的。我想是**安德鲁·休伯曼**，我几周前和他交谈过，他当时在说不要给孩子过量服用**褪黑素**。我想之后我做了一些研究，我读到一些东西说它可能对**青春期**有影响。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Uh, it's a good question. So, when you start to look at melatonin overdose and you start to look at melatonin on board for long periods of time, there's been some conflict in the in the research. Um, there's a group of people that say if you stay on melatonin for extended periods of time, your body stops producing it. There's another group of people that have looked at research and have said actually that's not the case. So, right now we have we have studies that lead out to about a year or so on melatonin. And when you stop their melatonin production after they've been taking it for a year, their body seems to start back up no problem. It's different than testosterone, right? So with testosterone, we know that when men start taking testosterone, their body actually stops producing it. With melatonin, that does not appear to be the case, but we don't have studies that go out past, you know, that yearong. And so if somebody's been taking melatonin every day for 5 10 years, you know, you you kind of start to wonder uh what's going to happen. Also, don't forget that that melatonin is different than the melatonin that's actually produced in your head. I think it was Andrew Huberman who I was speaking to a couple of weeks ago that was was saying about not giving kids an overdose of melatonin. And I think afterwards I I was doing some research on it and I read something that said it has an impact on puberty potentially.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 所以在高剂量下，**褪黑素**是一种**避孕药**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So in high dosages melatonin is a contraceptive.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 所以那会暂停**青春期**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: So that would pause puberty.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 完全正确。或者改变它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Exactly. Or change it

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 以我们可能知道或不知道的方式。所以，我同意**安德鲁**的观点，再次强调，**褪黑素**不是孩子需要的东西，除非您的孩子有**自闭症谱系**，那是我发现它有帮助的地方，我以前也治疗过这样的孩子，但一般来说，我不会给18岁以下的人服用**褪黑素**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: and ways we may or may not know. So, I agree with Andrew on that point that again, melatonin is not something that kids need unless you've got kids on the spectrum, which is again where I find it to be helpful and I've treated kids with that before, but generally speaking, I don't put melatonin on anybody under the age of 18.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 如果我服用大量**褪黑素**，我更容易做噩梦吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Am I more likely to have nightmares if I'm having lots of melatonin?

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 如果您过量服用，会的。所以，高剂量**褪黑素**的头号副作用是**超级生动的梦境**，然后最终是**噩梦**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: If you're overdosing, you are. So, the number one side effect of a high dose of melatonin is super vivid dreams and then eventually nightmares.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 为什么？我不太确定。如果我猜测的话，我会说，您从**褪黑素**中做**疯狂生动的梦**的部分原因可能是因为它确实会让您比平时更快地进入**快速眼动睡眠**，并且可能会让您在那里停留更长时间。我没有任何数据支持这一点。所以，我想明确一点。这更多是我的一个假设，但这对我来说可能在直觉上是合理的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Why? I'm not really sure. If I was garnering a guess, then what I would say is that part of the reason why that you have crazy vivid dreams from melatonin is because it probably does put you into REM sleep a little bit quicker than you normally would and might keep you there a little bit longer. I don't have any data to support that. So, I want to be clear. Um, this is more of a hypothesis on my end, but that might make intuitive sense to me.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 快速搜索一下，您说对了。它说它会让你在**快速眼动睡眠**中停留更长时间，而且更强烈。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Just on a quick search, um, Sure. You're right. It says it keep keeps you in REM sleep a little bit longer and more intensely.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 就是这样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: There you go.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 这会导致**生动**、**高度生动的梦境**或**夜惊**，这反而会让您醒来时感觉更疲惫。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: This leads to vivid highly vivid dreams or night terrors which paradoxically makes you wake up feeling more exhausted.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 对。我数不清有多少人告诉我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Right. I can't count the number of people who tell me

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 我需要回去睡觉，因为我的梦让我太累了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: I need to go back to sleep because I'm so exhausted from my dreams.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 哦，哇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: Oh wow.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Right.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 那么我们来结束这些**补充剂**的话题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So let's finish off on these supplements then.

</details>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: 是的。绝对是。所以我们稍微谈了一下**褪黑素**，就像我说的，选择性使用。我们这里还有一些其他的，其中一个是**瓦莱里安根**。对。所以当我们谈论**瓦莱里安根**时，它可能是研究最多的，它是一种根，它被称为**瓦莱里安根**，但明确地说，它是一种**抗焦虑药物**，对吧？所以它能帮助您降低**焦虑水平**，这就是它倾向于起作用的原因。有趣的是，当您查看数据时，它与**啤酒花**（就像您在啤酒中发现的那样）结合使用时效果更好，所以很多时候当您寻找一种制剂时，您应该寻找**瓦莱里安根**加**啤酒花**的制剂。另外，我们应该谈谈**补充剂**。很多人不理解这一点，但很多人会把一大堆不同的**补充剂**混合在一起，然后装进一个胶囊里。我不认为那是个好主意。我认为您应该使用**单一成分补充剂**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Michael Bruce**: Yeah. Absolutely. So we talked a little bit about melatonin which like
