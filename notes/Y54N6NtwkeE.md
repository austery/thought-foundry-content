### 稳定币：加密世界的真实存在与潜在风险

欢迎收听OddLots播客的又一期节目。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to another episode of the OddLots podcast.</p>
</details>

主持人Joe Weisenthal分享了他对**稳定币**（Stablecoins: 一种旨在将其价值与标的资产（如美元）挂钩的加密货币）的三个看法：首先，他认为在更广泛的加密货币领域中，稳定币是真实存在的，将持续发展并可能变得非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to another episode of the OddLots podcast. I'm Joe Weisenthal. Tracy, I have three thoughts about stable coins. One is I think within the broader realm of crypto, stable coins are real and here to stay and probably going to be important.</p>
</details>

其次，他认为有些稳定币似乎是绝对的“摇钱树”，因为它们无需向持有者支付任何收益，却能从其支持资产中获取收益，这看起来是一个绝佳的商业模式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Two, some of them seem like an absolute cash money maker because you don't pay any yield to the holders. You collect the yield for what you have backing it. It's a great business model. It seems amazing.</p>
</details>

第三，作为“大金融危机”一代的产物，Joe确信如果加密货币在未来的金融危机中受到牵连，那很可能与稳定币有关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And three, as the child of the uh great financial crisis generation, I'm convinced that if crypto is ever implicated in a future financial crisis, it might have something to do with stable coins.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway表示，Joe几乎说出了她所有的观点，她也曾记下笔记，认为发行几乎没有回报的负债是一种绝妙的商业模式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You stole all my talking points, Joe. Honestly, the same brain. I had like the note written down that, you know, issuing liabilities that mostly return nothing is a wonderful business model.</p>
</details>

Tracy补充说，稳定币是加密货币与受监管金融系统主要的接触点，因此人们可能会预期一些金融稳定问题会在此处显现。她还对稳定币与银行直接竞争的理念很感兴趣，尤其是一些稳定币开始提供收益，变得更像货币市场基金或存款产品时，这将如何影响金融格局。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, also I was thinking stable coins are basically the primary touch point of crypto to the regulated financial system. And so you would expect some of those financial stability concerns to potentially materialize there. And then the one thing you didn't mention that I'm interested in is also this idea of competition directly with the banks. And as stable coins get more money market fund like maybe more depositlike, we have some stable coins that issue yield. Now what does that actually look like for the financial landscape?</p>
</details>

Joe认为，对于各种传统支付公司来说，其网络使用费相当高昂。理论上，稳定币交易的成本几乎可以忽略不计，这看起来很有吸引力。然而，让人们大规模从借记卡或信用卡转向稳定币是一个棘手的“鸡生蛋，蛋生鸡”问题，但它确实是现有支付方式的有力竞争者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Totally. For traditional payment companies of all sorts, I mean we all know that legacy payment companies collect a pretty big rent so to speak for use of their network. In theory, there could be almost no cost at all for a stable coin transaction or virtually minimal. It seems appealing. On the other hand, getting people to switch on mass from using like a sort of debit card or credit card to a stable coin is sort of a tricky chicken and egg problem, but you know, it's a real competitor to an existing way of doing payments.</p>
</details>

Joe还指出，稳定币对美国财政部也变得日益重要。美国财政部长**斯科特·贝桑特**（Scott Bessant: 虚拟人物，此处可能为虚构或笔误）预计，所有新发行的稳定币将增加对美国国债（主要是短期国库券）的需求。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Also, the one thing we didn't mention is it's kind of becoming important from a fiscal standpoint for the United States. And you have Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant saying that he expects all this new stable coin issuance to basically increase demand for US debt for treasuries for mostly tea bills. And so there's a lot to talk about.</p>
</details>

### Circle的商业模式与USDC的全球扩张

今天，我们有幸邀请到**Circle Internet**（Circle Internet: 一家全球金融科技公司，专注于数字货币和区块链技术，是USDC稳定币的发行方）的联合创始人兼首席执行官**杰里米·阿莱尔**（Jeremy Allaire）。Circle最近于6月初上市，并经历了一次巨大的首次公开募股（IPO），市场对其公司表现出令人难以置信的需求和热情。Circle是**USDC**（USD Coin: 由Circle和Coinbase共同发行的与美元挂钩的稳定币）的赞助商，USDC是仅次于**泰达币**（Tether: 另一种主要的美元稳定币）的第二大稳定币。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There is a lot to talk about. We really do have the perfect guest today. We are going to be speaking with Jeremy. He is the co-founder and CEO of Circle Internet. They recently went public in early June and they've had a monster IPO. Incredible demand for this company. incredible enthusiasm. They are of course the sponsor of USDC, one of I think it's the second biggest stable coin out there after Tether. So Jeremy, thank you so much for uh coming in studio here on OddLots. I'm really excited to be here. As uh you guys laid out, there's a lot to talk about.</p>
</details>

Joe指出，稳定币似乎是一种令人难以置信的商业模式，因为人们持有不产生收益的代币，而这些代币通常由产生收益的资产支持。然而，在Circle的案例中，大部分收益都流向了**Coinbase**（Coinbase: 美国最大的加密货币交易所之一）。他请Jeremy解释Circle与Coinbase的关系，以便人们理解资金流入和流出的经济学原理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I said it in the beginning, stable coins seem like an incredible business model because here you have all these people holding a non-yield bearing token. They're backed by in many cases yield bearing assets that incorporate a lot. On the other hand, in Circle's case, a lot of the money that occurs to you goes straight to Coinbase. Explain to us your relationship with Coinbase and so people can understand sort of the economics of the money that you bring in and then how it goes out the door.</p>
</details>

Jeremy Allaire首先从一个更高层次的视角进行阐述。Circle的业务被视为一个互联网规模的平台和网络公用事业，它是一套建立在公共互联网上的软件，人们可以在其上进行构建和集成，提供全球范围内存储和转移价值的公用事业。这包括受监管的部分和技术部分。Circle的目标是建立全球最大的稳定币网络，拥有最多的使用量、交易量和实用性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, maybe I'll actually start with something a little bit higher level and then drill in. So when we think about our business and what we have built and what we operate is we think about it as an internet scale platform and network utility. So, we're a set of software on the public internet that people can build on and integrate to and it provides this utility which is this global utility for storing and moving value around the world. And there's a regulated part of it and there's a technology part of it. And so, as part of that, we want to build the largest stable coin network in the world with the most usage and the most transactions and the most utility. We can talk more about what that looks like.</p>
</details>

自2018年推出以来，Circle一直专注于建立前期实用性并发展良好的分销关系。衡量网络规模的标准是能够使用USDC的人数。目前，全球有超过6亿个账户可以访问和使用USDC，其中很大一部分是通过分销伙伴实现的，例如Coinbase和**币安**（Binance: 全球最大的加密货币交易所之一）。此外，USDC还可以在**Robinhood**（Robinhood: 一家提供免佣金股票、ETF和加密货币交易的金融服务公司）、**Kraken**（Kraken: 一家加密货币交易所）、巴西最大的新银行**Nubank**（Nubank: 巴西一家领先的数字银行）以及菲律宾的主流金融产品**GCash**（GCash: 菲律宾领先的移动支付和金融服务应用）等超级应用中找到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And as we built this, as we launched this back in 2018, we knew that we needed to really focus on building upfront utility and then building really good distribution relationships. And so in our business, we have sort of the scale of the network, which is measured by the number of people who can reach in their pocket and use USDC. There are over 600 million accounts that can access and use USDC around the world. A lot of that is through distribution partners that we have like Coinbase. Coinbase is one, Binance is another, and many, many more. You can find USDC on Robin Hood, on Kraken. You can find USDC in super apps in foreign countries like New Bank, the biggest NEO bank in Brazil, or in a product like GCash in the Philippines, which is the dominant financial product for many Filipinos. And so, we make that product available globally. And we have a philosophy of incentivizing, you know, distributors to grow with us. And so, I think that's really fundamental to the philosophy. And right now I think we're in the early stages of building this. You know, the the numbers in the aggregate are sizable, but when we think about what this can grow into and the volume of money storage and money movement that will happen in an internet native way, you know, we we think we're still in the very early stages of that.</p>
</details>

尽管Circle是全球第二大稳定币发行方，但Coinbase去年从其储备资产中获得了超过50%的收入，这似乎是一笔不小的分销费用。Joe询问这种合作关系是否总能保持合理性，以及协议续签的频率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, I understand that argument, but Coinbase also took, I think, more than 50% of your revenue from reserve assets last year, which seems like a lot to pay for distribution when you're already the second biggest stable coin in the world. Is that partnership, you know, will the math always make sense to you? And I guess how often do you actually renew that agreement?</p>
</details>

Jeremy回应称，Circle与Coinbase关系良好，Coinbase一直是重要的合作伙伴，很早就对USDC寄予厚望。他赞扬**布莱恩·阿姆斯特朗**（Brian Armstrong: Coinbase首席执行官）预见到USDC可能成为其整个业务的基础部分。Coinbase已将USDC整合到其所有零售和机构产品中，并围绕它开发新的支付产品。这种大型“锚定租户”对于推动网络实用性至关重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, so a couple things. So, first of all, we have a great relationship with Coinbase. They've been such a huge partner and really bet big on this way before anyone else. And so I think I give Brian a lot of credit for really seeing that USDC could be a fundamental part of their entire business. And really they've baked USDC into all their retail products, their institutional products. They're building new payments products around it. They're really betting not the entire company, but they're betting a lot on it. And that's amazing. And when you think about networks that were built in the past from the 70s or the 80s or in other times, you definitely need these big anchor tenants that really bet on it and help drive the utility.</p>
</details>

Coinbase的积极参与也帮助在其他地方创造了使用需求，例如Coinbase最大的竞争对手币安也是USDC的重要合作伙伴。随着**《Genius法案》**（Genius Act: 一项关于稳定币的联邦政策和监管法案）的通过和全球监管清晰度的提高，稳定币正进入一个新篇章。过去主要集中在加密交易市场，现在正迈向主流，支付公司、银行、金融机构、资本市场公司以及众多消费互联网公司都开始参与进来。Circle认为，市场份额将变得更加多元化，整个市场规模将不断增长，参与者的多样性也将随时间增加。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But to the degree that Coinbase has leaned in, that's really helped create demand for usage in other places. So Coinbase's largest rival, Binance, for example, is also a significant partner on this. And I think with the Genius Act passing, which I know we'll come back to, and regulatory clarity kind of happening around the world, we're entering a new chapter in all of this. We were sort of in the early adopter phase, which was really primarily anchored in like crypto trading markets and things like that. And now we're entering this kind of more mainstream phase where payment companies, banks, financial institutions, capital markets companies, lots of consumer companies, consumer internet companies are all getting involved. And so our view is that the sort of share of the pie as it were is going to be more and more diversified and grow the pie will grow and the diversity of the participants and that will grow over time as well.</p>
</details>

### 《Genius法案》：稳定币监管与金融体系整合

Joe询问《Genius法案》对Circle业务意味着什么，以及法案前后有何变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Real quickly, what is the genius act mean for your business? What changes pre and post Genius Act?</p>
</details>

Jeremy认为《Genius法案》意义重大。Circle自2013年以来一直在推动联邦政策和监管，以规范这种新型电子货币。该法案首先将Circle运营核心的许多原则写入联邦法律，包括透明度、主要审计以及安全稳健性要求。它确保储备金本身是有效的现金工具，并允许将其视为现金工具。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Genius Act is very significant in our view and it's actually in some ways we've been arguing for kind of federal policy and regulation around this new form of electronic money to some degree since I went to the capital in 2013 and started articulating a regulatory view on this but in a very significant way really for the last 5 years we've been pushing for federal regulation and what that does is first of all it enshrines in federal law, many of the things that we had made core to the way we operate, transparency, having major audits of our firm, safety and soundness requirements. It ensures that the reserve itself is effectively a cash instrument and allows this to be treated as a cash instrument.</p>
</details>

这个联邦框架以两种重要方式开启了机遇：首先，对于公司和金融机构而言，他们现在清楚稳定币的定义，可以将其作为现金持有在资产负债表上。这为支付稳定币在批发支付、零售支付以及作为资本市场场所的合格抵押品铺平了道路，极大地拓宽了稳定币的使用范围，并为金融机构和公司提供了明确的定义和信心，让他们知道可以与稳定币进行交互，并且其受到破产保护。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And by having that federal framework, it opens up opportunities in two significant ways. I think the first is now if you're a a corporation, a public corporation, or you're a financial institution, you now know what these are. You can hold these and treat these like cash on your balance sheet. This paves the way for the use of payment stable coins in wholesale payments, retail payments, as eligible collateral on capital markets, venues. So it really opens up the aperture of what people can use this for and it gives all those financial institutions and and companies the clear definition and the faith that they can interact with this and they know it's bankruptcy protected and all this good stuff.</p>
</details>

其次，将稳定币资金（Jeremy认为这是一种新型的**M1电子货币**（M1 electronic money: 狭义货币，指流通中的现金和活期存款，此处指一种新型的、可编程的数字现金形式））定义为美国金融体系的一部分，意味着它可以在国际上以非常重要的方式进行扩展。世界各国政府将能够制定自己的稳定币法律，并认可在美国联邦监管下的发行方，使其能够与各自市场互动。这极大地推动了稳定币在全球受监管金融体系内的采用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other big thing is that and this ties into one of the opening comments is having this as a defined part of the US financial system. So, stablecoin money, which in my view is a new form of M1 electronic money, having that as a defined part of the US financial system, means that it can be expanded internationally in very significant ways. Governments all around the world will be able to enact their own stable coin laws as they are, and I can talk about a dozen countries where that's the case, and they can recognize issuers that are under federal supervision in the US and enable those to interact with their markets. And so it opens up the global adoption here within the regulated financial system in a very major way. And so for us, all of that is we view as a tailwind to have more and more people building on top of this infrastructure that we've been building.</p>
</details>

Tracy询问，根据《Genius法案》，Circle是否仍然无法直接访问美联储的资产负债表。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So in terms of integration with the financial system and competition with the banks, of course, you still under the Genius Act, you do not have access to the Fed's balance sheet. Is that right?</p>
</details>

Jeremy确认了这一点，并解释说《Genius法案》并未具体规定谁可以访问美联储的资产负债表，但它确实允许稳定币的合格储备金包括美联储持有的现金、短期国库券以及回购协议等。Circle最近宣布已提交申请，成立一家名为**第一国家数字货币银行**（First National Digital Currency Bank: Circle计划成立的实体，旨在成为一家国家信托银行，受OCC监管）的新实体。该银行正在向**美国货币监理署**（OCC: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency: 负责监管美国联邦特许银行和联邦储蓄机构的独立机构）申请成为一家国家信托银行。根据《Genius法案》，作为一家发行规模超过100亿美元（目前约为640亿美元）的大型发行方，Circle将受到OCC的监管。Circle正努力使其基础设施与即将到来的监管体系保持一致，以确保为在其平台上构建的开发者提供最佳的基础设施。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's correct. So a couple things. So one is the Genius Act doesn't sort of specify who has access to the Fed's balance sheet. What it does say though is that uh uh eligible reserves in a stable coin can include cash at the Fed. It can include short duration T bills. It can include repo treasury repo facilities etc. And for us as circle, we actually just announced very recently that we had filed to establish a new entity called First National Digital Currency Bank. And First National Digital Currency Bank is in application with the OC to become a national trust bank. And under the Genius Act, as a large issuer, greater than 10 billion, you know, we're around 64 billion today, you know, we will come under OC supervision. And so we're trying to line up the kind of infrastructure of Circle against the kind of upcoming regulatory regime and we want to make sure we've got the best underlying kind of infrastructure there for people who would build on us.</p>
</details>

Joe表达了担忧，认为如果未来发生涉及加密货币的金融危机，很可能与稳定币有关，因为任何与美元挂钩但偏离美元的实体都可能引发问题。他提到2023年初**硅谷银行**（SVB: Silicon Valley Bank: 一家曾服务于科技初创企业的银行，于2023年倒闭）倒闭时，Circle曾短暂出现脱钩。他询问这种情况是否会再次发生，或者是否有办法确保其不再发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I said in the intro that my worry is that if there was ever a financial crisis that involves crypto connected, it's going to be somehow due to stable coins because I always think like entities that are pegged to the dollar that deviate from the dollar, that's where you get into trouble. People think this is a dollar and suddenly it's worth 95 cents. That actually did happen to circle in early 2023 very briefly with the collapse of SVB. Could that ever happen again or is there a way to say this could never happen again?</p>
</details>

Jeremy解释说，脱钩现象发生在二级市场交易中，当时银行被联邦政府接管，导致银行服务不可用。他认为核心问题在于，**全额准备金**（Full Reserve Model: 一种银行模式，要求银行持有与客户存款等额的准备金，而非部分准备金）模式是否比**部分准备金**（Fractional Reserve Model: 银行只保留客户存款的一小部分作为准备金，其余用于贷款）模式更安全。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, a couple things. So, secondary market trading is where we saw that. But you weren't able the desks weren't able to keep it at a dollar. Whatever it was that did happen. That's because the banks were seized by the federal government and so banking was not available over that time. But nonetheless, it's a really important question. It's a fundamental question, right? Which is the real question in my mind is is a full reserve model of money a safer model of money than a fractional reserve model of money.</p>
</details>

他指出，当前的金融体系中，**联邦存款保险公司**（FDIC: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation: 美国联邦政府机构，为银行存款提供保险）为部分准备金银行提供保险，但这主要针对小额储户。银行系统中绝大多数存款是无保险存款。虽然其中一些存款存在于所谓的“大而不倒”的金融机构，隐含着联邦政府的救助权力，但这仍然是理论上的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="p-text">And in our financial system today, we do have FDIC for the fractional reserve banks. Now, that's for small depositors. The vast majority of deposits in the banking system are uninsured deposits. Now, some of those sit with so-called too big to fail financial institutions, therefore implicitly have the bailout power of the federal government, like we'd never let them fail. But that's sort of theoretical. You could imagine a scenario where the federal government doesn't have the balance sheet or it doesn't want to create the inflation or or whatever it would be.</p>
</details>

Jeremy表示，缺乏政治意愿也可能是一个因素。他创办Circle的初衷，正是因为他对金融危机、货币本质、中央银行以及国际货币体系的运作方式感到着迷。他直觉上认为应该有更好的方式，并在2012年接触加密货币后看到了新的可能性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The lack of political appetite. Lack of political appetite. I mean, that was on the verge in the financial crisis that was jamming it through Congress, which was then challenged later. But I think and by the way this gets to the genesis of circle like why did I start this company? I spent a number of years like reading about what happened with the financial crisis how did this happen? What is the nature of money? What is the nature of central banking? How does the international monetary system work? All of these things were fascinating to me and I was running a completely different kind of business which was an online video technology business and I kind of thought intuitively that there had to be a better way and it was actually through my kind of introduction to crypto in 2012 that I sort of saw hey there might be a path here.</p>
</details>

尽管许多人关注比特币作为一种全额准备金的“健全货币”理念，但Jeremy更看重金融体系中不同的风险模型，特别是**全额储备美元数字货币**（Fully Reserved Dollar Digital Currency: 一种数字货币，其发行量完全由等值的美元储备支持）。他信奉**芝加哥计划**（The Chicago Plan: 一项在20世纪30年代大萧条后提出的货币改革方案，主张将货币发行权收归政府，并要求银行实行100%准备金制度），该计划在大萧条时期银行倒闭后被提出。该计划主张建立一个全额准备金模式，其中货币是政府义务或全额准备金形式的货币，由支付机构持有，而信贷业务则由独立的机构进行。银行不能凭空创造新货币，只能贷出全额准备金。这种理念旨在降低金融系统风险并平滑经济周期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And while a lot of people were obviously focused on Bitcoin as a full reserve sort of sound money philosophy and I'm sure you've had plenty of people to talk about that. Oh yes. Over the over the years, but for me at least the idea of sound money of kind of having a different risk model in the financial system was very appealing to me and in particular this idea of fully reserved dollar digital currency and you know I'm an adherent to the Chicago school and the Chicago plan I should say which was a particular philosophy that was advanced in the aftermath of all of the bank failures in the 1930. 1930s and there were really two responses. There was a group of prominent economists some of Irving Fischer who was at the Chicago school at the time and there was industry and the prominent economist said hey we could build a full reserve model where you have essentially government obligation money or this full reserve form of money that is in a payment type of institution a payment bank and then you have a separate institution which does credit and you can only you can't create new money out of thin air as banks do. you could only lend the full reserve money and the philosophy there was that that would sort of reduce risk in in the financial system and it would smooth out economic cycles and that's come and gone as a debate during the savings and loan crisis after the great financial crisis etc.</p>
</details>

Jeremy认为，数字货币的出现为这一理念带来了深刻的机遇，尤其是在互联网原生的货币方面。像USDC这样的数字货币，在《Genius法案》下被定义为现金工具，其储备金是完全储备的。数字货币的强大之处在于它继承了互联网的“超能力”，即互联网数据的速度和效率。这意味着存储和转移价值的边际成本趋近于零，货币流通速度可以显著加快。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I think the advent of digital currency in particular creates an opportunity for this that I think is really profound and when you think about native money on the internet. So take something like USDC which underrogenius sort of gets defined as this cash instrument the reserve instruments we can discuss are those you know safe in the sense of financial stability safe but you have a fully reserved instrument. What's powerful about digital currency is it inherits what I call the superpowers of the internet. Meaning it inherits the speed and velocity of data on the internet. And so all of a sudden the marginal cost of storing and moving value goes very close to zero and money velocity can accelerate significantly and that creates its own risks.</p>
</details>

这种高速流通的货币可以在互联网上，在任何人、实体、**AI代理**（AI Agent: 能够感知环境、做出决策并采取行动以实现特定目标的软件或硬件实体）和企业之间流动，甚至在机器互动中发生。Jeremy认为，互联网金融系统（一个正在从头开始构建的新金融系统）中的货币基础层需要是这种全额准备金形式的货币，因为它更安全，能够确保人们知道资金始终可用，且有可靠的监管和风险管理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But this high velocity money that's moving on the internet that can move literally from any person entity any AI agent any business all these sort of machine interactions all this stuff that happens globally it's kind of crazy to think about having that be the underlying on that to be like a bank's stack of lending risk and to have all of these lending risk IUS floating free circulating on the internet and so my view is that the base of money in the internet financial system which I think is a new financial system that's being built up from the ground up that the base layer of money needs to be this full reserve form of money that is actually safer that begs the question of how do you do credit and all that good stuff which I'm happy to give you my views on but I think the philosophy is actually how do you do something that's actually safer that people can look at and say I know that this is always available it's not that if the bank fails I might get my FDIC insurance cap. It's like I know what this is and there's a credential supervisor and there's actually this enforced risk management which improves and continues to improve over time.</p>
</details>

### 储备资产的安全性与透明度

Tracy提到《Genius法案》定义了稳定币应持有的储备资产，如国库券和高质量流动资产。她指出，金融系统几十年来一直面临安全资产短缺的问题，担心随着稳定币的增长，是否会有足够的国库券来满足1:1的储备要求，从而产生**挤出效应**（Crowding Out Effect: 指政府借贷增加导致私人投资减少的经济现象）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, you mentioned the safety of the reserve assets and this is something that is in the act. It kind of defines what you're supposed to hold. So things like tea bills, highquality liquid assets, all that good stuff. We've been talking about a safe asset shortage in the financial system for it feels like decades now, right? It feels like there is not enough good collateral to go around for everyone. And as stable coins ramp up, I'm really curious if you're worried about the crowning out effect, if there's going to be enough tea bills in the world to satisfy that 1:1 reserve requirement.</p>
</details>

Jeremy认为，如果稳定币完全依赖短期政府债务，并且规模达到数十万亿美元，那么可能会出现不匹配。然而，监管不会停滞不前。《Genius法案》的框架包括现金、超额抵押的回购贷款、最短期限的国库券以及金融系统中的现金和美联储的合格准备金。随着基础设施的扩展，这种组合提供了巨大的容量，足以支持数十万亿美元的价值。

<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, if it was exclusively on the basis of short-term government debt and this got to be tens of trillions of dollars or whatever, then then you might have a mismatch there. Now, obviously, regulation isn't going to stand still on this. So the genius act is a significant piece of legislation and it defines this framework. That framework is inclusive of cash that is overcolateralized lending with repo desks. It includes T bills of the shortest duration and it does include cash in the financial system and it includes eligible reserves at the Federal Reserve as cash as well. And so over time as this infrastructure scales I think that mixture gives us a huge amount of capacity that I think you know arguably could support many tens of trillions of of dollars of value.</p>

Joe追问Circle是否完全不接触非FDIC保险存款，是否完全脱离了该系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So wait just to be clear on one specific are you completely non-exposed to non-FDIC insured deposits? Are you completely extricated yourself from that system? No.</p>
</details>

Jeremy表示，Circle以最高的透明度运营，远超其他受监管的稳定币。他们通过两方面实现这一点：首先，他们创建了一个名为**Circle储备基金**（Circle Reserve Fund: 由BlackRock管理，旨在提供USDC储备金透明度的基金）的结构，旨在提供储备金的透明度。该基金与**贝莱德**（BlackRock: 全球最大的资产管理公司之一）合作，是一个在美国证券交易委员会（SEC）注册的**2A7基金**（2A7 Fund: 一种政府义务货币市场基金，受严格监管，要求高流动性和低风险），提供约90%储备金的每日透明度。人们每天都可以查询**USDXX**（USDXX: Circle储备基金的彭博终端代码），查看每张短期国库券的序列号，该基金的平均到期日约为23天。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and in fact, let me describe what we do. And we today by far operate with the greatest transparency of any other stable coin, any other, you know, regulated stable coin in the world. And we've done that through a couple of things. The first is we created a structure called the circle reserve fund, which is really designed to provide transparency into the reserves. So we did that with BlackRock and it's an SEC registered what's called 2A7 fund. So, it's a government obligation fund, but it gives daily transparency into essentially about 90% of everything in the reserves. And so, you can look every day. You can search USDXX. I pulled it up on my blue. There you go. And you can drill in and you can see exactly the serial numbers of every T bill, the short duration T bills, and we I think we have an average maturity of about 23 days in that reserve. And um Bloomberg says 13 right now, but I'm not I don't I you know, whatever. Is that what it says? That's what it says. I'm just looking I'm just looking at the screen. That may in fact I'm just looking at the screen. That may in fact be what it is today. That's that's what Bloomberg says. Great. Um</p>
</details>

其次，人们还可以看到Circle与之有回购关系的全球系统重要性银行。大约98%的现金由数量非常有限的全球系统重要性银行持有，这些银行是信用风险最低的现金托管银行。Circle需要这样做是为了确保日内流动性，保证在任何情况下都能随时提供50亿、100亿甚至更多的资金。此外，Circle还在不同地区的结算银行和储备账户中持有少量资金，以确保在新加坡、日本、欧洲等地都能轻松创建和赎回USDC。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and then you can also see like the global systemically important banks that we have repo relationships with and and that's there as well. So you can see that that's about 90%. And then there's cash and the cash about 98% of the cash is held with a very limited number of global systemically important banks. And these global systemically important banks are the sort of lowest credit risk kind of cash custodian type banks. And so we hold the reserves there. Now you can argue about how safe is that cash relative to, you know, kind of sharted out across all kinds of other stuff. But that's sort of what's there today. And we need to do that because we need intraday liquidity. We need to ensure that in the event of 5 billion, 10 billion, whatever it is, that's always available. And then there's a very very limited amount which we position in settlement banks uh and and reserve accounts in different geographies to ensure that it's easy to create and redeem USDC whether you're in Singapore or Japan or Europe and and other places.</p>
</details>

Circle还在欧洲单独发行USDC，并遵循欧洲的**Mika稳定币法规**（Mika Stablecoin Statutes: 欧盟《加密资产市场监管法案》（MiCA）中关于稳定币的规定），并已创建了跨这些法规的互换性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We also have a separate issuance of USDC and a a completely separate reserve mandate and supervision in Europe as well. So we dualissue USDC. We issue it under European rules under the Mika stable coin statutes and we issue it in the United States and we have created a way for kind of fungeibility across those.</p>
</details>

### 支付稳定币与代币化收益资产

Joe询问Circle的最终目标是否是与存款机构竞争，吸引大型企业客户，这些客户的资金可能无法完全获得FDIC保险，或者他们会将资金投入货币市场基金。他认为，实现这一目标的最大障碍可能是稳定币不支付利息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">H is the ultimate ambition to really take on and compete with the deposit taking institutions in the sense that you want to get big corporate clients maybe the type of clients that would put their money in uninsur well they have so much money some of it would end up being uninsured by FDIC or they might put it in a money market fund or something like that and if you're doing that doesn't it seem like the biggest hurdle is the lack of interest paid on stable coins</p>
</details>

Jeremy解释说，《Genius法案》以及欧洲、日本等市场的稳定币法律都将支付稳定币设计为用于支付的现金工具和支付系统技术，而非风险承担的存款和贷款工具，也不是投资产品。它们被狭义定义，且《Genius法案》对此进行了强制执行。他认为这是这种基础层现金工具的正确设计。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So a Couple things I think the first is that payment stable coins which is what the Genius Act governs it and in fact mirrors stable coin laws in Europe in Japan and in other markets that are bringing these online. These are designed to be cash instruments that are used in payments and as a as a payment system technology. They're not designed to be risk-taking instruments that you would say deposit and lend. And they're not designed to be investment products. You're not purchasing a security. you're not purchasing an investment. And so they're narrowly defined and Genius Act enforces that. And so I think that's the right design for this base layer kind of cash instrument.</p>
</details>

但这并不意味着不能构建产生收益的数字代币。虽然人们称之为稳定币，但这个术语可能会改变，未来可能被称为**代币化现实世界资产**（Tokenized Real World Assets: 将现实世界的有形或无形资产（如房地产、商品、股票等）通过区块链技术表示为数字代币）、**代币化货币市场基金**（Tokenized Money Market Funds: 将货币市场基金的份额代币化，使其可以在区块链上交易）或**代币化国库券**（Tokenized Treasuries: 将国库券代币化，使其可以在区块链上发行和交易）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now that doesn't mean that you can't build digital tokens that present yield. And while people call these stable coins, I think that term of art will probably change. People call them tokenized real world assets, tokenized money market phones, tokenized treasuries.</p>
</details>

Circle目前运营着一个大型的代币化货币市场基金产品，名为**USYC**（USYC: Circle发行的代币化货币市场基金产品）。USYC与USDC具有互换性，企业可以持有USYC以赚取典型的政府基金收益，同时能够即时创建和赎回现金及收益。Circle收购了**Hashnote**（Hashnote: 一家专注于代币化收益资产的公司），并将其整合到核心基础设施中。这种结构非常强大，因为它允许将代币化的收益抵押品即时用作现金进行结算、交易和消费。Circle能够独特地做到这一点，因为它拥有广泛采用的支付稳定币，并且USDC的储备金与USYC中的实际工具相互映射，从而实现了USYC和USDC储备金之间的互换性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we operate a sizable tokenized money market fund product called USYC and USYC is fungeible with USDC. So a business for example could hold USYC and earn the yield that would be your typical kind of government fund type yield but have the ability to instantly create and redeem cash and instantly create and redeem yield. And so we acquired a company called Hashnote and we've integrated that into our core infrastructure and we've just brought this online. It's it's a very powerful structure if you can have tokenized yield bearing collateral and then instantly uses as cash for settlement for trading for spending etc. And so I think that that's something that we can kind of do uniquely because we have this widely adopted payment stable coin and then kind of marrying those two together and and we can do it in a very very capital efficient way because essentially the reserves of USDC mirror the actual instruments in USYC and so there's a sort of fungeability between USYC and USDC reserves.</p>
</details>

### 竞争格局与网络效应

展望未来几年的竞争格局，Joe提到Circle与Coinbase的协议将重新审视。届时，**摩根大通**（JPMorgan: 一家全球领先的金融服务公司）可能推出自己的支付币，并希望成为Coinbase的首选币种，或者其他银行（如**花旗银行**（Citi: 一家全球性银行）和**美国银行**（Bank of America: 美国最大的银行之一））可能使用代币化的银行间结算币种来提高竞争力。此外，亚洲的**First Digital**（First Digital: 一家在亚洲运营的数字资产公司）等其他稳定币也在崛起。Joe询问，如果Circle仍需向Coinbase支付高额分销费用，那么在2028年，Circle的竞争优势将是什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So let's talk about the competitive landscape in a few years from now. So, at some point, you're going to revisit your agreement with Coinbase. Maybe JP Morgan will have a payment coin that they're going to want to be the preferred coin that sits there. And maybe they're going to be willing to give Coinbase a huge split for Pride of Place. Or maybe there'll be some other coin that they use for interbank settlements that'll be tokenized in some way to make their transfers with City and Bank of America and other banks more competitive. We have seen other coins rise, First Digital in Asia, for example. like if you're paying all this money to Coinbase still and you you know distribution is so important what is the competitive advantage that Circle has in say the year I don't know 2028</p>
</details>

Jeremy认为，理解Circle业务的关键在于它运营着一个互联网规模的平台和网络公用事业，拥有强大的互联网平台飞轮和开发者飞轮。其网络由成千上万的产品和服务组成，这些产品和服务已经实施并整合到Circle的网络中。每当开发者希望存储和转移数字美元时，他们会选择USDC，因为它拥有广泛且成熟的网络。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well I I think a couple things I think the first is that to understand circle's business is to understand that we operate an internet scale platform and network utility we have very powerful internet platform flywheels and developer flywheels we have a network that consists of thousands and thous thousands of products and services that have implemented and integrated to our network. And so every time a developer says, "Hey, I want to be able to store and move digital dollars, they choose to implement USDC because USDC has this really broad established network."</p>
</details>

这种**网络效应**（Network Effects: 指产品或服务的价值随着用户数量的增加而增加的现象）非常强大。例如，当巴西的Nubank增加USDC支持时，其1亿用户就可以与USDC互动，而世界其他地方也能从这个庞大的用户群中受益。在链上生态系统（有时被称为**DeFi**（Decentralized Finance: 基于区块链的金融服务，旨在通过智能合约提供传统金融服务））中，USDC占据了约75%的市场份额。Circle构建了协议，使得USDC在不同网络间的传输无缝、安全、高效。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so we have these really powerful flywheels and as that provides new utility to a user when say new bank in Brazil adds USDC, wow, there's like 100 million people at New Bank who can interact with USDC. Now the rest of the world can benefit from that user base of 100 million people. And so we have network effects that are there and those exist in in pretty powerful ways. So if you look at the movement of stablecoin in the onchain ecosystem, what sometimes people call DeFi, we have about I believe today around 75% of the market there. And we've built protocols that make it very seamless, safe, and secure and capital efficient to transmit USDC across all these different networks.</p>
</details>

此外，Circle还建立了非凡的流动性网络效应。多年来，他们在全球范围内建立了受监管的基础设施，并在新加坡、香港、日本、英国、欧盟、美国、巴西、墨西哥等地实现了金融系统整合，并宣布将在阿联酋上线。这意味着USDC在全球范围内都具有规模化的可用性和流动性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We've built developer platforms. We've built flywheels for adoption. And this is a classic internet platform model. The other is that we've built these extraordinary liquidity network effects. And this is really critical. So over the past number of years, we've built out on a regulated basis infrastructure where we're regulated and where we have integration into the financial systems of Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, the United Kingdom, the EU, the US. We've integrated into Brazil, Mexico, and we've just announced that we're coming online in UAE. So, we've built out these integration points, and we've built out primary liquidity in all of these markets. And so, USDC is available and liquid at scale all around the world. That's the primary liquidity side. And and so that's crucial. If you're going to use this, you need to be able to know I can get in, I can get out, and I can do that all around the world.</p>
</details>

Circle还创造了巨大的二级流动性，例如，在越南的电子货币产品与USDC之间的转换。因此，进入门槛实际上相当高。Jeremy认为，新的稳定币的边际价值目前几乎为零，必须具备已建立的网络实用性和规模化流动性。流动性产生流动性，网络速度扩展网络速度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then we've created very large secondary liquidity, and that's really important as well. So when you get down to the e-money product in Vietnam, can you go from that e-money product in Vietnam into USDC and back and all around the world? All these different payment methods and payment instruments and the actual secondary liquidity between those and USDC is huge. And so the barrier to entry is actually fairly high. We have these large network modes and right now, so it's not just like making a new ERC20, making a new coin. The marginal value of a net new stable coin right now is effectively zero. You have to have established network utility and then liquidity at scale. And essentially liquidity begets liquidity. Network velocity extends network velocity. And so you know we feel like that's a very very good position.</p>
</details>

Jeremy强调，联邦监管以及对基础设施的更高要求也至关重要。Circle不仅在美国，还在全球其他司法管辖区受到严格监管。他们专注于构建基础设施，使其易于被科技公司、金融科技公司和银行采用。他们与全球最大的核心银行基础设施公司建立了合作关系，例如最近与**Fiserve**（Fiserve: 一家全球领先的金融服务技术提供商）和**FIS Global**（FIS Global: 一家全球领先的金融技术公司）的合作。他们还将USDC作为创新产品整合到这些公司的基础设施中，甚至与**Visa**（Visa: 全球支付技术公司）和**Mastercard**（Mastercard: 全球支付技术公司）等卡网络合作，将USDC用作内部结算系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think the ability to be you know federally regulated and to have these higher bars on the infrastructure side and what's required of you is is also really important. That's not something for the faint of heart. and doing that all around the world, not just in the United States. There's a lot of focus on the United States, but we've been under significant regulatory regimes in other jurisdictions for for quite some time as well. Those are, you know, meaningful barriers. And I guess the bigger picture there is like we're just focused on building this infrastructure, making it easy to adopt by whether it's a technology company, a fintech company, a bank. We're building partnerships with some of the biggest core banking infrastructure companies in the world. We announced something recently with Fiserve. Just yesterday, we announced a broad partnership with FIS Global. And these are companies that service tens of thousands of banks. And we're plugging USDC as a innovation into their infrastructure. And so we even do it with the card networks, Visa and Mastercard, where they're using USDC as an internal settlement system to move money from issuers back to home base faster than the correspondent banking system. There's lots of places we're getting integrated.</p>
</details>

Jeremy认为稳定币网络是一个“赢者通吃大部分”而非“赢者通吃所有”的市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what I like to say is I believe that the stable coin stablecoin networks are a winner take most not a winner take all market.</p>

### 可编程货币的未来与互联网金融系统

Joe询问，十年后稳定币的格局会是怎样，以及不同稳定币之间的互操作性将如何发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This was going to be my next question. Can you talk about that a little bit more like 10 years from now what is the landscape actually look like and what is the interoperability of all these different stable coins actually look like? Yeah. So I think 10 years from now I don't think we have any idea what it's what it's going to look like. But I mean there there's several different components.</p>
</details>

Jeremy表示，十年后的情况难以预测，但有几个关键组成部分。他认为稳定币是迄今为止创造的最高效用的货币形式，不仅因为它拥有互联网的速度和成本效率等“超能力”，还因为它是有史以来第一个真正**可编程的货币**（Programmable Money: 能够根据预设规则自动执行交易和操作的数字货币）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. Several different components to this. So I think one is we take as a first principle that stablecoin money is the highest utility form of money that's ever been created. And it's it's the highest utility not just because it has internet superpowers of speed and it cost efficiency but because it's actually the first truly programmable form of money.</p>
</details>

如果有了可编程货币，软件中介和基于货币的软件创新将是前所未有的，这引入了一个全新的货币效用领域。他指出，**DeFi**（Decentralized Finance: 基于区块链的金融服务，旨在通过智能合约提供传统金融服务）的整个现象，即高度复杂的市场结构，实际上是互联网上自主运行的机器代码，这非常令人惊叹。当这种创新曲线被释放时，就像手机刚出现时一样，人们对移动设备充满热情，但早期的设备体验很糟糕，直到**iPhone**（iPhone: 苹果公司推出的智能手机，彻底改变了移动通信行业）的出现才真正开启了可编程应用程序的创新时代。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if you're going to have a programmable form of money where software intermediation and software innovation on top of money has not existed, open banking is like poor cousin. So you're introducing a new realm of money utility and we're at the very front edges of that. And we see that already today. I mean the entire phenomenon of DeFi, which is highly sophisticated market structures that are just autonomous machines effectively running in in code on the internet. That's pretty amazing. So when you unleash that and you unleash that kind of curve of innovation, like it's sort of like when mobile devices were out, people were into mobile for a really long time and they were like, "Hey, mobile's going to be huge and Mobile World Congress was like the biggest conference in the world." And you'd go there and there's like 100,000 people there and and yet it all sucked like like all the mobile phone devices, everything was everything was terrible, but everyone believed in mobile. And then obviously the iPhone came and that was the end. It wasn't the end. It was the beginning is the point is that like actual innovation with programmable apps on phones actually started then in a real way.</p>
</details>

Tracy分享了一个她最近遇到的用例，她希望能够将她的软件与**ChatGPT**（ChatGPT: OpenAI开发的大型语言模型）连接起来查询AI，但需要输入信用卡信息并复制粘贴代码，这非常麻烦。她希望能将她的软件与一个稳定币钱包连接起来，通过**AI**（Artificial Intelligence: 人工智能）按使用量付费，而无需注册账户。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I had a use case recently where I wanted there to be a stable coin use case and I think maybe this will coming. So I've tried to do vibe coding where I was like going on cursor and making software and I wanted to link up my software to chat GBT so that it could query the AI. Yes. And to access the API I had to like enter in a credit card with GPT and then I had to like copy and paste this code. It was really annoying. And I was like why can't I just have my cursor be linked to a stable coin wallet? it make the connection with Chad GBT's AI so that I don't have to make an account and it just pays per usage that is intelligence</p>
</details>

Jeremy认为这绝对会发生。他指出，当存储和移动信息的边际成本趋近于零时，全球信息产出呈百万倍增长；当软件可以通过浏览器分发时，全球软件产出也呈百万倍增长。他相信，未来十年，全球支付量将增长许多个数量级，因为成本和摩擦被消除，并且可编程性带来了新的效用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That is definitely what's going to happen and in fact this is where I was getting with my point actually in response to you Tracy which is like we think about the internet and like when the marginal cost of storing and moving information went to zero the net world output of information like millionxed or when software could be distributed to a browser the net world output of software was like up a millionx so we create these huge growth so my view is that over 10 years, we're going to use your 10-year, is that the total payment volume, which is a measure that people like to use, is likely going to go up by many, many, many orders of magnitude because you've taken that cost and friction out and because of the new utility that comes from programmability.</p>
</details>

他相信，未来世界中货币的流通规模将远超今日。这就像互联网基础设施真正触及金融系统，带来了巨大的货币流通速度和机器通过AI进行中介。因此，需要非常安全的**全额准备金工具**（Full Reserve Instruments: 储备金完全覆盖其负债的金融工具）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so my own belief is that the scale of money that moves in the world will be so much larger than where we are today. It's sort of the internet infrastructure actually hitting the financial system which is a scary thing because like wow you've got all this money velocity and you've got machines that are intermediating this through AI like oh my god that's one of the reasons why it needs to be very safe full reserve instruments.</p>
</details>

Jeremy认为，金融机构创造的贷款和投资场所将激增。他相信，由于区块链、代币化和稳定币，信贷中介和可投资资产的创新将迎来新的复兴。在一个全额准备金的系统中，需要能够利用这些资金进行信贷中介，并使其尽可能高效。他认为，可以在链上构建更安全、更透明、风险管理更可审计的信贷中介，并构建更易于全球更多人和机构访问的市场结构。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it also I think gets to the heart of your question which is are we going after all the deposits of the banks or all this is the the answer is no but my belief is that financial institutions who create either places where people can lend their money and then that money can be used for other investing purposes or where people actually make specific investments with their money like those will proliferate. In fact, I think innovation in both credit intermediation and in investable assets is about to go through a new renaissance because of blockchains, tokenization and stable coins. And so my own view is in a in a system of full reserve money, you need to be able to do credit intermediation with that full reserve money. And you need to make that credit intermediation be as efficient as possible. And I think you can build onchain credit intermediation in a way where you have greater safety, more transparency, more auditable risk management, and you can build market structures that are far more accessible to more people and institutions in the world.</p>
</details>

Joe认为，互联网作为我们所知的免费浏览模式可能会消亡。如果AI机器人可以搜索网络，网站将要求为其数据抓取付费。稳定币可以解决这个问题，但未来可能是一个完全不同的模式，即所有内容都根据数据拉取量进行计量收费。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tracy, I kind of think by the way, and we should maybe do a separate, I think the internet as we know it in terms of like internet that's free to browse is probably going to die because on a matter of time, you know, if you're like AI bot can like go search the web, those sites are going to want payment for having all their data scraped. And you know, stable coins could solve that, but it does feel like we're going to have a totally thing where like you don't just get to use the web for free. Everything is like metered based on the uh the data that you're pulling.</p>
</details>

Tracy也同意，流量已经开始下降，因为搜索引擎直接提供AI摘要，内容提供商不会长期容忍这种情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Well, we were talking about that earlier, right? This idea that we've already seen traffic start to collapse because the search engines are just providing AI summaries to individual pages. Yeah. How long are content providers like uh like us? How long are they going to stand for that? I don't know.</p>
</details>

Jeremy透露，Circle与Coinbase及其他公司合作实施了**X42**（X42: 一种协议，允许通过API进行无需注册的支付）。**马克·安德森**（Marc Andreessen: 著名风险投资家，网景浏览器联合创始人）多年前就曾谈论过这一点。这是一种已经存在于每个网络服务器、浏览器和客户端中的协议，它使用现有的HTTP传输。现在，当有人访问内容或数据时，可以要求他们付费，并通过区块链上的稳定币支付。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, can I say something on that which is we actually worked together with Coinbase and a couple of others on implementing some something called X42. Now, you're like, what is that? And Mark Andrees talks about this and he has over the years back in the early days of the web, you know. Oh yeah, there you go. Actually, pay via API without registration. That's what I want. That's what I want for my V code. So there exactly what I'm looking for. So it's actually a it already exists as a protocol that is built into the way that every web server, every web browser, every client that interacts with the internet works. It's a protocol that's there. It uses the existing HTTP transport. And now you can actually say, "Hey, I'm hitting my piece of content or data." And I can challenge whoever's accessing it and say, you know, to get to this, you need to pay me. And it can basically come back and say, you can pay me on a blockchain with a stable coin.</p>
</details>

Circle正在用USDC推广这种做法，并鼓励开发者使用。许多第三方正在为AI代理构建层来利用这一点。Jeremy认为，未来可能会有更多的订阅模式，例如像Spotify那样的“天体点唱机”，或者更广泛的“天体数据盒”，消费者前端可能是**OpenAI**（OpenAI: 一家人工智能研究公司，开发了ChatGPT）或**谷歌**（Google: 全球领先的互联网科技公司），通过订阅付费，然后后台通过按次付费或按使用量付费的模式来补偿实际的数据提供商和创作者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so we're doing that with USDC. We're encouraging developers to do that. There's lots of third parties that are building layers for AI agents to use this. And so I think that's one example, but I think it gets to the heart of what you're you're saying, which is there may be more of a subscription model. Spotify is probably the best example where you have the celestial jukebox and you pay your 15 bucks and you get access to everything. You know, there's a kind of question about could there be a celestial data box which is more broad and where the actual consumer frontends are companies like OpenAI or Google and you're paying a subscription and then there's like a behind the scenes either Pratta or usagebased model that is actually compensating the actual data providers and creators and so lots to be unfold here. Yeah.</p>

### Circle与Tether的竞争及行业成熟度

Joe提出了一个略显尴尬的问题，询问Jeremy对Tether的看法，因为Tether不仅是市场第一，而且多年来其储备金质量一直受到质疑，尽管透明度有所提高。此外，Tether的CEO几个月前曾表示将扩展到美国市场，这似乎将直接与Circle在其本土市场竞争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can I ask a slightly awkward question? It's a leading question. How much do you hate Tether given that not only are they number one, but you know, there's been questions over their reserve quality for many years, although I think some of their transparency has improved. But thirdly, you know, we had the Tether CEO on um a few months ago, and they're expanding into the US. So that would seem to, you know, directly be competing with you on your sort of home turf, although I understand you're also expanding elsewhere in the world. How do you feel about Tether?</p>
</details>

Jeremy表示，Circle的观点始终是着眼于长期发展，并从一开始就采取了不同的方法：监管优先、合规优先，广泛获得许可和监管，并不断倡导改进。这使得Circle能够建立一个强大的业务，并与银行等金融部门深度整合。作为一家公开上市公司，Circle拥有最高的治理和问责标准，并一直致力于提升这些标准。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I mean look, I think our view has always been that we're building for the long run and we've taken a different approach really since inception. We've taken a you know a sort of regulatory first approach, a compliance first approach, becoming widely licensed, widely regulated, always advocating to improve that. And that's allowed us to build obviously what we think is a great business. It's allowed us to have deep integration into the financial sector with banks. If you're a major institution partnering in this space, the probability of you doing that with Circle is reasonably high. And so we built a really great franchise and we are really well known for integrity, for trustworthiness. We're a publicly traded company with the highest standards of governance and and accountability that are out there. And we've always sought to uplevel that.</p>

他认为，如果正在构建一个新的互联网金融系统，并且这个系统将被主流公司、上市公司、金融机构和金融中介机构广泛使用和整合，那么他们会希望与值得信赖、受良好监管的公司合作。他指出，市场早期的采用者阶段主要由加密交易主导，而现在正进入一个不同的阶段。过去18个月，Circle的市场份额有所增长，并且业务的国际化程度越来越高。在许多其他市场，监管机构也制定了非常明确的稳定币发行方法规。例如，Circle是唯一在欧洲合法可用的大型全球美元稳定币。

<p class="english-text">And so my view is that if we're building a new internet financial system and that new internet financial system is going to be this incredibly broadly used infrastructure and it's going to be used by like mainstream companies and public companies and and financial institutions and financial intermediaries all around the world are going to integrate with that and build on that. They're going to want to do that with trusted well-reggulated companies. And so our view is that the early adopter segment of the market which has really been dominated by sort of the crypto trading side of things is that early adopter segment. We're now going into a different chapter. And if you actually look at over the last, you know, 18 months, we've taken market share, we've taken, you know, material market share and we're growing in many, many areas. And I would say also internationally, I would say the majority of our business now is international. So we're in many many markets and in many other markets as well the regulators are putting in place very clear regulations around what stable coin issuers need to be and so we are the only large global dollar stablecoin that's legally available in Europe as an example.</p>
</details>

Jeremy对Tether所取得的成就表示尊重，但Circle选择了不同的道路。他重申，稳定币市场很可能是一个“赢者通吃大部分”而非“赢者通吃所有”的市场，未来可能会有三到五个主要参与者，其中一些可能尚未出现。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And so I think we just keep doing what we're doing I think we're building great infrastructure for companies for enterprises for developers and we just got to keep doing that and we'll grow and this is a really significant size market and so I actually you know I have a lot of respect for what they've been able to build. We took a different path. We built something also I think really special and over 5 years 10 years as we said earlier right this is very likely a winner take most not a winner take all market and I actually don't think we know you know if there you know maybe three or five big players I don't know what that'll be in five years or 10 years but there's probably some that don't exist yet that that will show up too.</p>

Joe认为，稳定币的兴起是行业成熟的标志。过去人们只对“数字上涨”感兴趣，现在则对“数字持平”感到兴奋，如果稳定币能永远保持1美元的价值，那是一个非常好的信号。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I take it as a sign of maturity. Like years ago when it came to crypto, people were just excited about number go up, right? And then now it's like people are really excited about number go sideways. And so if it just stays at one forever, that's like a really good sign. And so I take it as a sign of maturity for the industry that there is all this interest in stable coins. Nonetheless, no pun intended. Nonetheless, you know, all those public chains are still out there and USDC is on a number of chains, 24.</p>
</details>

Joe询问，鉴于Circle的中心化性质（资金由BlackRock基金持有），为什么还需要为去中心化链支付费用。他认为，一旦接受了中心化的前提，用户就不再关心底层区块链，而只关心发行方的声誉和银行中的资金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When we talk about like who collects the profits from this and we've talked specifically about say your distribution with Coinbase and whether that do you see value acrewing to token holders of different chains in the future because it seems to me like for the most part as long as it's like really fast and cheap. It really doesn't matter if I'm sending something to Tracy. I care about your reputation and your money in the bank. I don't really care about what chain that you actually transact over at the end. If you want to do it under Salana or some layer three that gives almost no value back to the ETH chain or something like that, I don't really care. Do you see like token holders of the public chains collecting rents in your future or collecting a meaningful amount of rents from this onchain commerce?</p>
</details>

Jeremy回应说，公共区块链是一个通用层，许多应用程序可以在其上构建。稳定币无疑是杀手级应用，但还有许多其他类型的应用程序。这些计算平台需要创新，需要更高的速度、更大的隐私、更好的计算形式以及更多新的基础设施原语。公共网络需要支持大规模的消费者和企业应用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a great question. I I'd say a couple things and and I'm actually going to relate back to my my mobile commentary from earlier which is our mental model is that blockchain networks are internet operating systems and they provide a way to store data conduct transactions on that data and and provide compute around those transactions and data. That's what they do. They're public computing machines and there are a lot of them. There's actually, you know, thousands that have been that have been launched. We're on 23 or 24 today. And we see this as a space that is constantly evolving. And so there's constantly innovation on the layer ones. There's these layer twos. When I think about where we are relative to where we were with say iPhone, we're in the pre iPhone era of blockchain networks in my view, right? I I think um there's lots of operating systems out there just like there were lots of mobile operating systems and some of them got better than others and improved the user experience. Some of them started enabling consumer things. remember NT Docomo in Japan or or things like that. And so I think that we're still really early. And so that's one of the reasons why we've, you know, really tried to make sure we're trying to operate our own stable coin network on the best ones that are out there.</p>
</details>

他认为，这些网络需要一种费用模型。Circle已经创建了一种方式，使得许多区块链网络的费用可以直接用USDC支付。他预计，未来**Gas费**（Gas Fees: 在区块链网络上执行交易或智能合约所需的计算成本）将越来越少地以其他加密商品支付，而是直接用稳定币支付。这些网络具有价值，并且如果它们提供可扩展的基础设施，代币持有者很可能也会获得价值。稳定币只是其中一个应用层，未来还会有更多应用层。人们为共享的机器状态、数据状态、交易状态和计算状态付费，这本身就具有价值。

<details>

<p class="english-text">It just seems to me that decentralized chains, you pay them a rent because you want some advantage of decentralization. If I'm using USDC, I've already accepted the premise of centralization. You have money in black the black rockck fund. It's about it's about as centralized and legacy fi as you could probably get once I've already accepted this premise of centralization that my money is just backed by a bank. Why do I even care? Why why pay these rent to some network of computers? So this is this is it's a different layer is is essentially my thinking is that public blockchains are a general purpose layer that many many applications can be built on top of. Stable coins are the killer app for sure. I will say in my own opinion, but there are many many different kinds of applications that can be built on that. And we need innovation in those computing platforms. We need higher speed. We need greater privacy. We need better forms of compute. We need new and you know more primitives in that infrastructure and that needs to expand. We need to get to a point where these public networks are supporting huge scales of consumer applications and enterprise applications. And so there's like a a growth in that kind of infrastructure side of it and that's those are shared infrastructures that many people can can take advantage of. And so there needs to be a kind of fee model on those networks. We've actually created a way for the fees on many of these blockchain networks to actually just be paid in USDC. And so that's something that we see more of happening that like the notion of gas fees or the notion of gas fees in some other crypto commodity will will become less and less common and like fees will just be paid in in stablecoin. But I think there is value in these networks and I think that there's very likely value for token holders on these networks if these networks provide you know scalable infrastructure that that people can take advantage of. Again, stablecoin is one application layer there and there'll be many many other application layers on those and and so you kind of pay for the shared the shared state of the machine, the shared data state, the shared transaction state, the shared compute state. There's value in paying for that shared state.</p>

### 客户需求层次与用户体验

Tracy询问，在与客户或潜在合作伙伴交流时，他们最感兴趣的是从Circle获得什么。她希望Jeremy能提供一个USDC客户需求层次，例如他们是否关心技术速度、储备资产或公司治理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just on this note, can you tell us when you're talking to clients or potential partners like what is it that they are most interested in getting from you? Can you provide us with a sort of hierarchy of needs for you know USDC customers in the sense of are they worried about the speed of the technology? Are they worried about the reserve assets and I guess corporate governance and things like that? How would you prioritize what people are actually thinking about?</p>
</details>

Jeremy表示，Circle的合作对象范围广泛，从在新兴市场创建新产品的独立开发者，到构建链上协议的团队，再到寻求以不同方式使用或整合稳定币的大型金融机构。他们的关注点各不相同，但他认为信任、透明度和流动性对每个人都非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, we have a huge range of types of people that we work with from like individual developers that are creating a new product in some emerging market to you know people building onchain protocols to very large you know financial institutions that are looking at using this or integrating this in different ways and so the things that they you know care about do vary across those but I would say trust transparency liquidity are really really important to everyone, right?</p>
</details>

对于开发者来说，他们需要知道这是一种合法的数字美元，可以在他们打算服务的市场中访问，人们可以轻松访问和使用，并且基础设施良好，能够构建良好的产品和用户体验。他们关心开发者工具、链上基础设施、流动性和信任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If I'm a developer and I'm building a product, I need to know that this is a legitimate digital dollar, that it's accessible in the markets that I'm intending to serve, that people can easily access it and use it, and that the infrastructure is good. I can build good product experiences. I can build good user experiences and build an application or or or something for my own customers that works well. And so they care about the developer tooling, the onchain infra, the liquidity, the trust. They care about all those things as a startup.</p>
</details>

对于大型公司，例如大型金融科技公司，他们更关心Circle的法律和合规状况、公司自身的治理以及影响Circle的底层法规，因为他们在菲律宾、巴西或美国都面临同样的问题。他们还关心基础设施的准备情况，以及是否能带来大量用户。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But even a large company, say you're a big fintech and you're like, "Hey, I want to start leaning into this. I want to add stable coins for payments or I want to enable my customers to access DeFi or other things like that." They're going to care more about the kind of legal and compliance status of Circle. they're going to care about the governance of the company itself, but also of the the underlying regulation that affects us because they have to face those same issues whether they're in the Philippines or in Brazil or in the United States. So they care a lot about those things and then they also care about infra clearly like infrastructure readiness. Is this something like I could bring a large number of users to?</p>
</details>

最后，所有人都关心用户体验，即能否创造一种让加密货币“消失”的体验，让用户无需知道自己在哪条区块链上，也无需关心Gas费，只需轻松地存储和转移价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then everyone cares about user experience, right? Can I craft an experience where the crypto disappears, where I don't need to know what blockchain am I on I'm on and I don't need to know about gas fees and I I just want to create a way for I have a I have stored value. I want to enable people to move it around really easily. They care a lot about that whether you're the biggest company in the world or or a small startup.</p>
</details>

Joe感谢Jeremy Allaire的到来，并称赞Circle是第一家尝试通过监管途径并在此过程中没有被“摧毁”或“陷入困境”的加密公司，这令人印象深刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jeremy Alert, thank you so much for uh coming on. Thank you. My pleasure. probably the first crypto company I can think of that actually tried to go through the regulatory approach and didn't get destroyed and bogged down in the process. Very impressive and um yeah, great chatting with you. Thank you.</p>

### 稳定币的未来：机器支付与用户体验

Tracy和Joe在节目结束后讨论了他们未及提出的问题。Joe反思，他曾想问是否能用稳定币买咖啡，但现在认为这可能不是思考稳定币的正确方式。如果稳定币成为重要的支付工具，那将是机器对机器的支付，它们将融入互联网的内部运作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tracy, you know, one question I didn't get to ask or I forgot to ask is like the perennial like will I ever buy coffee with a stable coin at some point? Maybe I will, maybe I won't. But in the conversation, I started thinking that's probably the wrong way to think about it. It's going to be those machineto-achine payments that if stable coins become a real important payments thing, it's going to be like those like computer to computer payments that have to be seen, right? And they're sort of plugged into the inner workings of the internet. Yeah, that makes sense. Maybe the coffee thing will happen. Who knows? But like I don't know.</p>
</details>

Tracy同意，买咖啡已经是一个“已解决的问题”，而机器支付则是一个新问题，稳定币可以解决。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't find it that hard to buy a coffee right now. No, that's the thing. That's the problem, right? Exactly. Coffee is solying coffee is a solved problem as far as I'm concerned. Yes. But this is a new problem. You're right. it could be solved. That's interesting.</p>
</details>

Joe还认为，去中心化与传统金融之间的张力非常有趣。虽然人们谈论DeFi和区块链，但最终资金却由BlackRock这样的中心化机构持有。这表明，稳定币的价值在于解决软件支付层的问题，提供一个全球性的平台，任何人都可以轻松接入和编程，实现资金的便捷传输。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other thing I thought was really interesting was you hit upon the sort of tension in the decentralization versus like traditional finance and this idea that like okay it's all about DeFi and blockchain and all that stuff but ultimately like Black Rockck is holding the money. Yeah. No, totally. And this is like, you know, it's it goes back to those formative episodes we did with Austin Campbell, which is a big part of the story to the extent that this will be a thing is like just solving the sort of software payments layer because we could do a million episodes on legacy texts and why JP Morgans or whatever companies internal software will always be they'll be spending billions of dollars upgrading it, whatever it is, and the difficulty of integrations. But if you could just have like a oneoff like so like global platform that anyone can plug into and program where money can easily be transmitted that's very powerful.</p>
</details>

Tracy强调，用户界面和用户体验的重要性被低估了，这是竞争的关键战场，即与其他系统连接和互操作的能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. This is why I say user interface user experience is underrated. Right. That's like me saying Michael Jordan is underrated. It's but like that really that really is it right? Like that's where the battleground kind of is the ability to like plug in and interoperate with all these different systems.</p>
</details>

Joe和Tracy都表示希望未来能再次邀请Jeremy Allaire参与节目。
