title: 揭秘“幽灵舰队”：全球石油运输的隐秘网络
summary: 本期节目深入探讨了“幽灵舰队”或“暗影舰队”现象，即利用欺骗性手段运输受制裁石油的油轮。专家Christian Tbert详细介绍了这些船只如何通过关闭信号、伪造位置（欺骗）和更改船名、船旗等方式规避监管。节目还分析了美国及其盟友加强对这些船只的执法行动，以及其对全球石油市场和地缘政治可能产生的深远影响，包括保险市场的变化和潜在的报复行动。

### “幽灵舰队”的定义与运作

**Rachel Abrams**: 来自《纽约时报》，我是 Rachel Abrams，这是《每日播报》。总统特朗普说，美国已经在美国海岸附近扣押了一艘油轮，地点在委内瑞拉。自从十二月以来，美国一直在阻止和扣押进出委内瑞拉的油轮。这实际上是美国历史上最大的一次扣押。在特朗普总统对载有受制裁委内瑞拉石油的船只实施封锁之后。画面显示美国直升机包围着船只。你看到了吗？这些船只属于被称为“幽灵舰队”的一部分。这是美国海岸警卫队正在扣押另一艘“幽灵舰队”油轮。现在美国正在委内瑞拉附近追踪第三艘油轮。这些油轮试图秘密地运往世界各地。现在有四艘船只在美国的监管之下。还有几艘正在被追踪。这标志着美国扣押的第五艘油轮，以及第六艘油轮。现在是第七艘受制裁的油轮，为委内瑞拉、伊朗和俄罗斯等国家提供资金。今天，我的同事 Christian Tbert 将详细介绍这些“幽灵舰队”到底是什么，以及它们的末日是否即将来临。今天是星期二，一月二十七日。Christian，欢迎来到《每日播报》。

**Rachel Abrams**: From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams and this is the daily. President Trump says that the United States has now seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela. And so this is >> since December, the US has been stopping and seizing oil tankers traveling in and out of Venezuela. >> Largest one ever seized, actually. after President Trump imposed a blockade on ships carrying sanctioned Venezuelan oil. >> Showing US helicopters surrounding the ship. You see that there? >> Ships that are part of what's known as a ghost fleet. >> That's the US Coast Guard seizing another ghost fleet tanker. >> This now as the US is pursuing a third oil tanker near Venezuela. >> Oil tankers that try to secretly make their way around the world. >> Four vessels are now in American custody. Several more are being tracked. It marks the fifth tanker the US has seized a sixth oil tanker. Now >> a seventh sanctioned oil tanker >> funding pro states like Venezuela, Iran, and Russia. Today, my colleague Christian Tbert on what these ghost fleets are exactly and how their days might be numbered. It's Tuesday, January 27th. Christian, welcome to the Daily.

**Christian Tbert**: 谢谢。所以 Christian，美国几周来一直在阻止和扣押进出委内瑞拉的油轮。起初，这似乎是针对尼古拉斯·马杜罗总统的施压行动的一部分，但显然美国后来抓获了马杜罗。我想很多人认为，这项努力，这种对船只的压力会停止，但实际上它不仅仍在继续，而且还在扩大。你是新闻编辑室里关于这些油轮的常驻专家。你一直在追踪这一切，是我们视觉调查团队的一部分。那么，让我们从头开始。什么是“幽灵舰队”或“暗影舰队”？

**Christian Tbert**: Thank you. So Christian, the US has been seizing and stopping oil tankers coming in and out of Venezuela for weeks now. And at first this seemed like part of a pressure campaign against President Nicholas Maduro, but then obviously the US captured Maduro. And I think a lot of people assumed that this effort, this pressure on the ships would stop, but instead it's actually not only continued, but expanded. You are the newsroom's resident expert on these oil tankers. You've been tracking all of this as part of our visual investigations team. So let's start at the very beginning. What is a ghost fleet or shadow fleet?

</details>

**Christian Tbert**: 这是一个很好的问题。除了“暗影舰队”和“幽灵舰队”，还有一个词是“暗黑舰队”。所以，这很有趣，因为没有一个明确的定义。它基本上是指那些使用欺骗性手段来隐藏它们正在运输受制裁石油的油轮。这些石油是由美国制裁的。而这些船只想要隐藏它们正在装载和运送这些石油的事实。为什么我知道很多关于它的信息？是因为在 2022 年 2 月俄罗斯全面入侵乌克兰之后，出现了同样的兴趣激增，比如“幽灵舰队”、“暗黑舰队”、“暗影舰队”。我的经理问我，克里斯，你能查清楚这些舰队的船只到底是什么吗？所以，这就是我开始接触它的方式。但有数百艘油轮，甚至可能数千艘。我们真的不知道。基本上，这些油轮运载的是受制裁的俄罗斯石油，或者受制裁的伊朗石油和委内瑞拉石油。它们总是为这三个国家中的一个或多个国家运输石油。大部分石油运往中国，也有相当一部分运往印度。而这些船只已经决定这样做。如果你运输受制裁的石油，并且试图隐藏它，那么可以赚很多钱。

**Christian Tbert**: That's a very good question. Besides shadow fleet and ghost fleet, there's a third term which is dark fleet. So >> it's interesting because there's not a well- definfined definition. It's basically a term for oil tankers that use deceptive practices to kind of hide that they're transporting sanctioned oil. Oil that's sanctioned by the United States. And these ships want to hide that they're picking up this oil and delivering this oil. Why do I know a lot about it? Is because that after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022, there was this same sudden surge in interest like ghost fleet, dark fleet, shadow fleet. And my manager asked me like, Chris, can you find out what are actually the ships of this fleet? So that's how it started for me. But there are hundreds of tankers, maybe even thousands. We don't really know. And basically these tankers are shipping sanctioned Russian oil or sanctioned Iranian oil and Venezuelan oil. They're always shipping oil for either of these three countries and sometimes for all three. Most of the oil goes to China and a significant portion goes to India as well and these ships have decided to do that. There's a lot of money to make if you're shipping sanctioned oil and they're trying to hide that.

**Rachel Abrams**: 明白了。好的。那么，考虑到这被称为“暗影舰队”，你对有多少世界石油是通过这种方式运输的，有什么概念吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Got it. Okay. So, do you have any sense given the fact that this is literally called a shadow fleet of how much of the world's oil is transported this way?

</details>

**Christian Tbert**: 很难说，对吧？因为他们显然试图欺骗所有人，让他们以为他们真的在运输这些石油，但全球大约有 10% 到 20% 的油轮从事这种活动，这相当多了。但考虑到这只与俄罗斯、伊朗和委内瑞拉有关，根据现有数据，它们在全球市场上的石油份额约为 3% 到 9%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christian Tbert**: It's hard to say, right? Because they're obviously trying to deceive everyone that they're actually shipping this oil, but it's probably around like 10 to 20% of oil tankers worldwide that have engaged in this kind of activity, which is quite a bit. But given that it's only related to Russia, Iran, and Venezuela, the share of the oil on the world market is about 3 to 9% according to the data that's available.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 那么，显然制裁是为了在经济上打击这些国家，但在这些具体案例中，目标是什么？所以，这些美国制裁的目的是什么？基本上是限制流入克里姆林宫的收入，以资助他们在乌克兰的战争努力；对伊朗来说，美国说，你知道，他们利用石油收入资助他们与真主党和其他美国不喜欢的活动。委内瑞拉也是如此。它是在支持马杜罗政府。

**Rachel Abrams**: So obviously sanctions are meant to hurt countries economically, but what are the goals in these specific cases? So the point of these US sanctions is to basically limit the revenue that's going to the Kremlin to fund their war effort in Ukraine to Iran, which the US says, you know, they're using the revenue from oil to fund their activities with Hezbollah and other other activities that the US doesn't like. And the same with Venezuela. It's it's it's propping up the Maduro government at the time.

</details>

**Christian Tbert**: 但我们看到的是，他们成功地将这些石油运往世界各地，并且仍然从中赚取可观的收入。基本上没有人阻止他们，尽管理论上制裁
