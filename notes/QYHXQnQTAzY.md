### 最高法院裁决与关税政策演变

本周，主要股指基本原地踏步，尽管标普500指数收复了50日移动平均线，但拉长时间来看，各大指数已连续数月未有显著变动，动能正在减弱，这并非积极信号。

上周最重磅的新闻无疑是周五的**最高法院**（Supreme Court）裁决，认定总统无权依据紧急权力施加关税。回顾去年四月，总统曾高调宣布将对多国施加关税，引发市场恐慌。此后，许多国家与美国签署了谅解备忘录，并在某些情况下促成了具体投资，例如报道称日本作为美国盟友，正根据贸易协议进行投资。然而，公众普遍质疑总统是否真有此权力，认为其做法可能过于极端，并质疑是否存在如与加拿大之间的“边境危机”般，足以让总统宣布紧急状态并施加关税的理由。

周五，**最高法院**的裁决证实了公众的疑虑：总统无权依据《美国贸易竞争法》（AIPA）施加关税。法院指出，总统可以采取如禁运等措施，但关税属于国会的税收权力范畴。尽管国会拥有税收权力，但过去几十年通过立法已将大量关税权力下放给总统。因此，总统无法依据AIPA施加关税。

然而，总统在裁决后立即举行新闻发布会，宣布将通过**第122条**（Section 122）的法律依据，在全球范围内实施10%的关税，该条款在法律基础上更为稳固。随后，通过社交媒体，他进一步宣布将关税提高至全球15%。根据**第122条**，总统可以实施15%的全球关税，但最长仅限150天。此外，总统还可以通过其他更传统的途径施加关税，例如**第301条**（Section 301）。在其首个任期内，总统曾对中国实施**第301条**关税，此措施在拜登政府时期得以延续，并持续至今。**第301条**关税的实施需要经过调查和听证程序，但其法律基础更为坚实。因此，当前的策略似乎是，虽然失去了AIPA关税的依据，但将用为期150天的**第122条**关税取而代之，同时进行必要的调查，以便后续启动**第301条**关税。

根据**Bloomberg**的分析，最终整体关税税率可能保持不变，总统只是将其法律授权从AIPA转移到更不易被法院推翻的法律依据上。这意味着“关税壁垒”将继续存在，尽管过程中出现了一些波折，但总统最终将实现其目标。值得注意的是，拜登政府也延续了特朗普时期的大部分关税措施，这表明关税很可能将继续存在于民主党政府之下，这已成为美国的新的贸易政策。

Hello, my friends. Today is February 21st, and this is Markets Weekly. So, this past week, the major indexes basically went nowhere. We did have the S&P 500 regained the 50-day moving average, but when you zoom out a bit, it really looks to me that the indexes have gone nowhere for months, are losing momentum, and that is not good.

So the biggest news the past week of was of course the Supreme Court bombshell on Friday ruling that the president cannot impose tariffs under emergency powers. So today let's first talk about what happened there and what could be the next steps and secondly let's talk about some miscellaneous topics like data fed minutes ECB. All right starting with the tariffs. So, just for some context, remember last April Liberation Day? The president stood in the rose garden with this giant poster board with all sorts of random numbers on it and declared that he was going to impose tariffs bigly on many countries throughout the world unless they came and made a deal that panicked the markets. But in the months that followed, many countries did come and sign memorandums of understanding with the US. In some cases, uh they did result in concrete investment. There's reporting that Japan uh a very very good US ally is making investments according to their trade deal. However, many people were wondering does the president actually have authority to do that? That seems kind of uh excessive. I mean does is there really a fentinel crisis with Canada such that the president can declare an emergency and impose tariffs?

Well, we were all about to find out. On Friday, the Supreme Court ruled that actually no doesn't give the president power to impose tariffs. The president can do things like embargos, but a tariff is a taxation power resizing Congress. So the president can't do that. And the Supreme Court is completely correct. Congress has the power of the tax. But over the past few decades, Congress has through legislation delegated a lot of tariff power to the president. So whereas the president cannot we find out impose tariffs under AIPA. The president had a news conference right after the uh Friday ruling and declared that he would impose global tariffs of 10% through section 122 pars which is on much sounder legal grounds. On Saturday morning uh through uh truth social tweet he declared that he's actually going to raise them to 15% globally. Now under section 122 the president can have 15% tariffs globally but for a maximum of 150 days. However there that is not the only avenue where the president can impose tariffs. He can also impose tariffs through other more traditional means such as section 301. During his first term the president imposed section 301 tariffs on on China that continued under the Biden administration and continued to this day. The difference is that in order to impose tariffs under section 301, you have to have an investigation, a hearing, and then you can impose tariffs. However, tariffs under that section are under are on much sturdier legal ground. So the game plan seems to be that sure we're losing AIPA tariffs but we will replace them with section 122 tariffs for 150 days and in the meantime we'll conduct all the necessary investigations so that we can have other section 301 tariffs ready to go.

So according to analysis from Bloomberg it seems like at the end of the day overall the tariffs rates will basically be unchanged. the president would simply shift uh his legal authority from aipa to other legal authority that's um less likely to be overturned by the court. So it looks like we are going to have this tariff wall. It's going to continue. This has been a hiccup, but the president is ultimately going to get what he wants. Now I would also remind everyone that President Biden also continued a lot of the uh tariffs that Trump put on. So these tariffs will probably going to continue under a democratic administration as well. This really does look to be uh the new trade policy for the United States of America.

### 关税收入归属与退还困境

然而，关于过去一年依据AIPA征收的数千亿美元关税收入，其归属和退还问题浮出水面。**最高法院**并未就此作出裁决，因此这部分争议将留待下级法院审理。这可能引发一场关于谁有权获得退款的复杂法律拉锯战。

**纽约联邦储备银行**（New York Fed）的一项新研究表明，关税主要由美国的进口商和消费者承担，这与2017-2018年特朗普时期的情况类似。尽管出口商也支付了一部分关税，但影响有限。关税确实在重塑全球贸易方面产生了影响，例如来自中国的进口量有所减少。但需要注意的是，其中很大一部分是贸易路线的转移，例如中国企业在**墨西哥**、**泰国**和**越南**等地设厂，通过这些国家进行生产和出口，以实现某种形式的“关税套利”。

然而，在退还关税方面存在一个核心难题：当商品跨越国境时，进口商是实际支付关税的一方。但进口商往往会试图将成本转嫁给消费者或下一级买家。这种成本转嫁的程度很难量化，并且具有主观性，使得进口商难以提供明确的证据链来向消费者证明价格上涨是由于关税所致。因此，如果直接向支付关税的进口商退款，他们将获得巨额“意外之财”，因为他们既能保留因提高价格而获得的额外收入，又能拿回已支付的关税。这无疑将制造一个巨大的混乱局面，目前尚不清楚如何解开这个死结。最有可能的结果是，相关诉讼将持续数年，关税收入在短期内将无法得到退还。

周五，市场对关税裁决的反应是积极的，因为这被视为暂时移除了税收负担。但鉴于关税即将回归，这种积极情绪是短暂的。一些人曾担忧，若**最高法院**推翻关税，债券市场将因赤字上升而剧烈反应，但实际情况是收益率仅小幅上升，这可能只是风险偏好情绪的短期波动。利率走势很大程度上仍遵循美联储政策的预期路径，且国债发行方式尚不明朗。即便赤字因缺乏关税而增加数千亿美元，财政部也可能通过发行短期国债来应对，而短期国债收益率很大程度上跟随美联储政策。因此，预计收益率不会出现大幅变化。总而言之，关税似乎已成为常态，公众需要适应。

However, what about all those tariff revenue collected the past year? There were a few hundred billion under AIPA. Now surely those are illegal and they have to be refunded, right? Because the president could not impose tariffs under AIPA. Well, actually the Supreme Court did not rule on that. So, uh, that's going to be a decision, uh, that's going to be litigated in the lower courts. So, this kind of sets up this huge messy showdown because, well, who is going to get the refund? Now, some new data, new study from the New York Fed shows that uh, actually tariffs were mostly paid by US importers and US consumers. This is also what happened in 2017, 2018 when Trump did tariffs the first time around. Uh the exporters did pay some tariffs but not a whole lot. The tariffs did seem to successfully have an impact on rewiring global trade. Looking at New York Fed study, uh there is much less imports coming from China. But keep in mind that a lot of it was simply rerouting where for example Chinese companies setting up shop in Mexico, in Thailand and Vietnam and basically producing and exporting from those countries some kind of tariff arbitrage.

However, um you know, this the subs probably did seem to have some did have some impact likely. Now, the problem with giving tariff refunds is that when an item comes across the border, the importer is the one that concretely pays the tariff. However, in some cases, the importer turns around and raises the prices to the consumer or whoever he resells it to to try to pass along some of the cost. how much that is, you know, no, that's going to be um, you know, honestly a kind of a subjective thing, right? So, I think it's unlikely for an importer to actually have a paper trail and tell the consumer or whoever that, you know, we're raising your prices because of this uh by this much because of the tariffs. So, if we were to get a big tariff refund to whoever paid the the tariff invoice, which would be the easiest way of doing this, uh the importer would get a huge windfall of hundreds of billions of dollars, right? Because they would be able to keep the extra revenue they received from raising prices to consumers and they would also get their tariff payments back. So, that's going to be a big mess. So, we're not really sure how that's going to be untangled. So, uh the most likely outcome is that we are stuck in litigation for uh a few years and none of that tariff revenue um gets refunded uh at least for for some time. So, the impact on the markets on Friday was was unambiguously positive, right? Tariffs are a tax and now that we have the tax removed, at least um perceived removed for that one day, but again, tariffs are coming right back. So, it doesn't seem like that's something to be concerned of. Now, some people were were thinking that if we had the Supreme Court overturn tariffs, the bond market will revolt because that means the deficit would go much higher. Uh we did seem to have yields go up a little bit, but really that that could just be a risk on episode. And to be clear, rates are largely the expected path of Fed policy and we don't actually know how the Treasury was going to issue uh debt going forward. suppose that the deficit really is going to be a few hundred billion higher due to the lack of tariffs. You know, maybe they just issue more in the short end and the short end it largely follows very very strongly follows expected path of Fed policy. So, so you really wouldn't expect to see much of a change in yields there. So, all in all, tariffs are here to stay guys just have to get used to it.

### 经济数据波动与货币政策分歧

接下来，我们转向一些杂项话题。上周公布的**GDP**数据显著弱于预期，部分原因是政府关门导致许多人无法工作。通胀数据也意外地上升。然而，从更宏观的视角看，过去几个季度**GDP**和通胀基本保持稳定，通胀略低于3%，**GDP**增长率在第三季度强于预期，第四季度则弱于预期，平均下来仍接近2%左右。这种相对稳定表明经济状况并未发生剧烈变化。

这引出了对货币政策的疑问。令人意外的是，**美联储**（Fed）会议纪要显示，部分**FOMC**（Federal Open Market Committee）成员认为，利率是“双向”的，不仅可以降息，也可以加息，似乎认为通胀依然顽固，货币政策可能不够紧缩，并考虑在今年晚些时候加息，或至少保留这种可能性。

然而，演讲者认为这种加息的提议是“荒谬的”，因为失业率呈上升趋势，通胀呈下降趋势（尽管有所平台化）。考虑到当前的高利率环境、疲软的消费者信心，以及政府希望降低利率的立场，与2021年通胀为5%时许多人称其为“暂时性”的观点相比，这表明一些官员可能并不清楚自己在做什么。演讲者认为，货币政策的走向将更多地取决于背景事件，而非未来几个月通胀的短期波动。

All right. Secondly, let's talk about all sorts of miscellaneous things that happened last week. So, we did have GDP data and we did have some inflation data. GDP was notably weaker than expected, surprisingly weaker than expected, largely due to the government shutdown. Remember last quarter the government was shut down for several weeks and we had a whole lot of people not working. Now, inflation was also surprising to the upside. But zooming out really GDP inflation h has been where it's been for the past several quarters. So inflation a little bit below 3% and GDP you know stronger than some expected on third quarter but again weaker than expected fourth quarter you average that out still seems to be like we're around 2% and change. So uh it seems to me that really we're just kind of pretty stable here. Um and so what does that mean for monetary policy?

Well, surprisingly in the Fed minutes, there was some commentary from some, let's just say, Fed presidents uh that maybe we should talk about that uh rates are two-sided, that we can not just cut rates, but we could also raise rates as well, seemingly thinking that, you know, inflation is still stubborn, maybe that we are not being restrictive enough, maybe we should hike rates later on in the year, or at least have the possibility of doing so. Now, for context, the market is pricing in two cuts this year. And uh you know, I I think it's kind of ridiculous for for anyone on the FOMC to be suggesting that they would hike rates. I mean, the trend for the unemployment rate is clearly upwards. The trend for inflation is clearly downwards, although of course it has been plateauing. So uh it's a high rates in in that context given that uh the broader public is feeling down on consumer sentiment given that the administration is insisting on lower rates and and given that um you know back in 2021 when inflation was 5% many people were saying that hey it's transitory we shouldn't do anything and that's just too ridiculous and shows me that yeah these what what I actually already know that many of these guys have no idea what they're doing. So, I don't pay any attention to that. Honestly, the path of monetary policy is going to be more dictated uh by events that are happening in the background that are far more important than uh whatever happens with uh inflation in in the coming months uh which we'll talk about a little bit.

### 欧洲央行政治博弈与地缘冲突预警

最后，我们转向国际政治动态。**欧洲央行**（ECB）行长**克里斯蒂娜·拉加德**（Christine Lagarde）可能会提前结束任期，以便总统**埃马纽埃尔·马克龙**（Emmanuel Macron）能参与任命其继任者。这与法国银行行长提前辞职以便马克龙任命继任者的情况类似。文章担忧，若右翼民粹党派获胜，可能会任命其属意的人选担任**欧洲央行**行长或对任命产生影响。

这种政治博弈被比作美国最高法院大法官的任免策略，即大法官倾向于在与其政治立场一致的总统任期内辞职，以便由同一阵营的总统任命继任者。这种担忧在于，欧盟政治格局的变化可能会影响货币政策，尤其是在法国，当前通胀低于目标，经济表现不佳，财政状况亟需低利率支持。因此，这构成了影响**欧洲央行**未来走向的一个重要政治因素。

此外，文章还指出，与**伊朗**的战争似乎“非常可能”在近期爆发，可能在本周末或未来几天。这建立在过去一年中东地区持续冲突的背景之上，包括去年以色列对**伊朗**的袭击（美国参与了防御性行动）以及美国轰炸**伊朗**核设施。目前，大量美军空军资产已调往该地区，另一艘航母也将于本周日到位，为可能针对**伊朗**的大规模军事行动做好了准备。尽管谈判仍在进行，但正如第一次行动期间一样，谈判与冲突可能同时发生。当前局势被描述为“火药桶”，极易被点燃，强大的政治利益可能成为导火索。

一旦发生，这场冲突很可能主导全球关注，盖过贸易政策或**GDP**等经济议题。尽管总统在过往的军事行动中取得过成功，但如此规模的行动存在诸多未知数。这被认为是未来几周最值得关注的事件，并且将带来巨大的“风险规避”（risk-off）效应。

And the last thing, miscellaneous thing that I I'll I'll mention is that there's an interesting article in the Financial Times saying that uh Madame Lagard, president of the ECB, is going to enter term earlier than before it expires uh because she would like to have uh President Mcron play a role in appointing her successor. For contest, uh the president of the bank to France also resigned earlier than expected so that Macron can name his successor. So the fear is according to the article that um you could have someone from the right populist party uh win and then appoint someone of their choosing to be uh president of the monk trance or uh have a say in who becomes president of the ECB. So it's it's playing a political game that we see sometimes in the US when it comes to the Supreme Court. Uh as we know oftentimes um uh a liberal justice would like to resign during a democratic president so that the replacement named could also be a liberal justice and a conservative justice would also like to resign during the time when a when a republican president is in charge so that a Republican president can name a uh Republican successor. So there are many people for example uh suggesting that maybe Justice Thomas who is a very conservative justice should resign at the moment so that Trump can replace him otherwise he could you know suddenly pass away on of natural causes during a democratic administration and get replaced by um a democratic justice and and tip the balance of power. So that's a game that we play in the US for the Supreme Court and now it seems that they're playing the same game in the European Union. So I thought that was an interesting development and it does show that they are very worried about uh perhaps if you could have a different political makeup in the EU that would leak into monetary policy. In the case of France uh actually the inflation is very much below target. The economy is not doing well and we all know they have a fiscal situation that would uh really appreciate lower rates. So that that's an interesting political dynamic to think about when thinking about the ECB going forward.

Um so one thing to keep in mind and the last thing we'll talk about is that it does seem that war with Iran is very likely um maybe this weekend maybe in the coming days. Now um recall uh there was an Israeli attack against Iran last year that the US participated in in a defensive way and the US also through operation midnight basically flew a bunch of bombers to Iran and bombed uh their nuclear facility. So uh there has been ongoing conflict in the Middle East involving the US for for a year now. And now with all the US air force assets being moved there and there is a huge amount of assets we have uh another carrier who that will be in position uh this Sunday. So they are in uh in a position to have a major operation against Iran. Um again they say that negotiations on ongoing but negotiations were also ongoing during the first operation as well. So there's a lot of tinder there and all it needs is a spark and sometimes when you have powerful political interests those sparks can be created. So that is something that could if it happens really dominate and o overshadow anything that happens in u trade policy or GDP or whatnot. uh there's a potential for this to become very messy. The president has had tremendous success in um extracting Maduro um in bombing Iran last year, but again there's many many unknowns when it comes to an operation of this scale. So that's something I think uh is going to be the biggest event to watch in the coming weeks. It would be tremendously riskoff. Um so that's uh what I would focus on for the coming days. All right. So that's how I prepare for today. Thanks so much for tuning in. I'll talk to you guys next week.
