summary: 围绕“AI改变不了什么”这一主题，OpenCode的Dax深入探讨了产品成功的三个关键要素：营销、Aha时刻和用户留存。他强调，尽管AI技术发展迅速，但它无法替代人类在创意、深度理解和解决复杂问题方面的核心作用。成功的营销需要引发共鸣的创意，Aha时刻需要无情地消除用户体验中的摩擦，而用户留存则依赖于构建可扩展的“原语”以满足高级用户需求。这些都是需要大量努力和创造力的领域，AI目前无法提供实质性帮助，产品成功的核心仍在于人类的智慧与实践。

title: AI改变不了什么：产品成功的永恒法则
---

### 引言：AI时代不变的产品成功法则

我被告知这次演讲的时长可以在5到55分钟之间，范围相当大，而且我可以随意发挥，跑题也没关系。所以我提前告知大家，并解释一下这次演讲的风格。我的名字是Dax，我正在做一个名为**OpenCode**（Open-source coding agent: 一个开源的编程代理工具）的项目。它是目前使用最广泛的编程代理工具之一，完全开源，并且支持任何模型。其他公司都喜欢说他们拥有最智能的编程代理工具，而我们则拥有最热门的。你可以去看看，它提供了出色的体验，拥有绝佳的**UX**（User Experience: 用户体验），完全可定制、个性化，是一个非常有趣的项目。

<p class="english-text">So, I was told that this could be between five and 55 minutes long, quite a range, and that I could yap and go on whatever side tangent I wanted, and it'll be fine. So, I'm just prepping you and giving you some explanation for why this is the way it is. Uh, so my name is Dax. I work on a project called Open Code. It is one of the most used coding agents out there. Uh, it's fully open source, works with any model. Um, every other company likes to say we have the smartest coding agent. Well, we've got the hottest coding agent. You go take a look at it. It's a great experience. Uh, awesome UX, totally themeable, personalizable, fun fun project to use.</p>
</details>

好了，我的宣传就到此为止。现在让我们进入这次演讲的核心内容。今天我想谈谈为什么AI不会让你成为赢家。我们正在参加一个AI大会，市面上充斥着大量的AI内容，似乎每个人都在谈论它。很多人说这是未来，它将改变一切，比如软件开发的方式将改变，甚至软件开发将不复存在。关于一切都将变得不同的疯狂宣言层出不穷，似乎只要你搭上这趟车，就能从中受益。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, that's all the shilling I'm going to do for now. Um, but let's get into the meat of this talk. So, what I want to talk about today is why AI is not going to make you a winner. Um, we're at an AI conference. There's a ton of AI content out there. It's all anyone's ever talking about these days. You got lots of people saying that this is the future. It changes everything. The way like software development is going to change. Software development is not going to exist. You've got all these crazy proclamations about how suddenly everything is different and if you hop on, you're going to be able to get the benefits.</p>
</details>

在某种程度上，这些说法确实有一些道理。但我想把重点放在那些没有改变的事情上，那些AI无法帮助你的事情。对于打造一个人们会使用的成功产品至关重要的因素，它们从未改变，短期内也不会改变。坦白说，AI在这方面并没有真正帮助我们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and some of that is, you know, there's some truth to that to some degree, but I want to focus on the stuff that hasn't changed, the stuff that AI is not going to help you with. Uh, the things that are critical to make a successful product that people use, these things haven't changed. They're not going to change anytime soon. And to be honest, AI has not really helped us with them.</p>
</details>

我将从**漏斗模型**（Funnel: 描述用户从初次接触到最终转化的过程）的角度来谈论这些事情。如果你正在开发一款产品，你希望用户开始使用它。他们从一无所知，到听说你的产品，再到尝试它，喜欢它，然后完全转化。如果我们思考这个旅程，其中有几个关键时刻。我将指出你需要关注的三个关键时刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I'm going to talk about things in terms of funnel. If you think about I'm making a product, I've got users that I want to start using my product. They start from knowing nothing about you to hearing about you to trying your product to liking it to then like fully converting. Uh if we think about that journey, there are critical moments. I'm going to identify three critical moments that you need to focus on.</p>
</details>

这在我整个职业生涯中一直如此，从未改变。这些是我每天都在思考、都在努力解决的问题。尽管我经验丰富，但它们仍然极具挑战性，而AI在这方面对我帮助不大。那么，让我们从第一个关键时刻开始。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's this has been true since for I mean my whole career. It hasn't changed. It's the things that I think about every single day that I struggle with. uh despite all the experience I have, it's still very very challenging and the AI stuff really hasn't done much for me. So, let's yeah, let's get started with the first one.</p>
</details>

### 营销：吸引注意力

漏斗模型最顶端的部分是营销。我一开始就要说，我接下来要说的话，你可能会感到很大的抵触。所以我先声明这一点，因为我记得我当初也有这种感觉。为了做好这部分工作，我付出了很多努力来克服自己的心理障碍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the absolute top of the funnel is marketing. And I'm going to say off the bat that what I'm about to say, you're going to feel a ton of resistance to. So, I'm going to preface that off the bat cuz I remember when I felt that way. Uh and it took a lot of effort in getting over like my own psychology uh to do this part. Well, um,</p>
</details>

营销的理念很简单。有人正在过自己的日子，他们有自己的问题，有自己的烦恼，专注于自己的生活。他们根本不在乎你或你在做什么。你必须想办法让他们停下脚步，放下手头的一切，看向你，思考你，并研究你所提供的东西。这是一个非常非常高的门槛。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the idea behind marketing is simple. You have someone that's going about their day. They got their problems. They got their worries. They're focused on their life. They do not give a about you or what you're doing. You have to figure out how to get them to stop in their tracks, drop everything else that they have, and look at you and think about you and look into what you're offering them. This is a really, really high bar to clear. Um, and I think when I talk about it in this way, the reason people feel resistance is because most of us aren't good at this.</p>
</details>

我认为当我这样谈论它时，人们感到抵触的原因是，我们大多数人都不擅长这个。你知道，这就像其他任何技能一样，你不可能从第一天起就做得很好。它完全超出了你的舒适区。不幸的是，很多人对这个事实的反应是，他们觉得不应该处理这个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, it's a skill like anything else, you are not going to be amazing at it from day one. It's way outside your comfort zone. Unfortunately, a lot of people's reactions to that truth is that they feel like they shouldn't have to deal with this problem.</p>
</details>

有很多想法，比如“如果我的产品足够好，它就会自己销售出去。我不需要做营销。我不需要做那些花哨的事情。你知道，我高于那些。”事实是，有些人制作的产品比你一生中能做的任何产品都要好。即使是市面上最好的产品，他们仍然需要考虑这个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, there's a lot of thoughts like, "Hey, if my product is good enough, it'll sell itself. Um, I don't need to do marketing. I don't need to do things that are gimmicky. You know, I'm above that. The truth is, there's people that make products that are better than anything you're ever going to do in your whole life. Like the absolute best products out there, they still have to think about this problem.</p>
</details>

所以，如果他们都不能免于思考“我如何吸引人们的注意力？”这个问题，那么你也不能。我也不能。我们都必须这样做。所以我最好开始擅长它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, if they're not too good to think about, hey, how do I get people's attention? Neither are you. Neither am I. Like, we all just just got to do it. So, I might as well start to get good at it. Um, the way that I like to think about it is</p>
</details>

你需要做一些有可能被分享的事情。如果你考虑标准的营销方式，人们会写一篇关于新功能的博客文章，或者他们会雇佣一个网红来谈论新功能，或者只是做一些几乎任何人都可以做的事情。你知道，现在每个人都莫名其妙地购买广告牌。这些努力的意义在于，它们确实有道理，你是在告诉人们你创造的东西。但基本上没有人会看到这些，然后说：“哦，是的，我必须把这篇关于这个76个功能的产品发布博客文章展示给我的朋友！”没有人会为此感到兴奋。他们很可能会直接划过去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you need to do things that have a shot at being shared. So, if you think about standard marketing, people will write a blog post about a new feature or they'll hire an influencer to like talk about the new feature or just kind of the things that pretty much anyone can do. Uh, you know, everyone just buys billboards these days for some reason. The thing with these efforts are they make sense, you know, you're like telling people about the thing you built, but there's basically zero chance that somebody sees that and they're like, "Oh yeah, I got to show my friends this blog post about this 76 feature, this product release, right? No one's getting excited about that. They're probably going to scroll right past."</p>
</details>

我的意思是，你知道现在的人是什么样的。你们都在玩TikTok。我知道你们的注意力持续时间基本上已经退化到一无所有。没有人能专注于无聊的事情。所以，这些都不能算作顶级的营销。它们无法让一个不了解你的人开始思考你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, you know what people are like these days. You're all on TikTok. I know your attention spans are just basically deteriorating into nothing. Uh, no one can focus on something that's boring. Um, so none of these things really count as top level marketing. They're not stopping someone who doesn't know about you to start thinking about you.</p>
</details>

这里的关键是想出一些让人们看到后觉得非常疯狂、非常有趣、非常深刻，或者非常触动人心的东西，让他们觉得“我必须把这个展示给我的朋友、我的同事。你能相信他们做了这个吗？”你希望引发人们这种类型的情绪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, the key here is to come up with something that someone's going to see and they're going to think it's so crazy or so funny or so uh, deep or so, you know, it it strikes a chord where they're like, I got to show this to my friends, to my co-workers. uh can you believe that they did this? You know, you want to elicit that type of uh emotion from someone.</p>
</details>

这个门槛听起来很简单，你知道，判断一件事是否能达到这个门槛很容易。但想出能达到这个门槛的点子却极其困难。这就是挑战所在。你必须有创造力。你必须想出有效的点子。你会失败很多次。这就像开发产品一样，你瞄准一次成功，你会尝试很多次，很多时候你会失败。营销也是如此。不要费心去尝试那些根本没有成功机会的尝试，对吧？那只是浪费时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The as simple as that bar is, you know, it's very easy to tell whether something's going to clear that bar or not. It's extremely hard to come up with ideas that do clear that bar. Um so that's the challenge. You got to be creative. You got to come up with ideas that work. Uh and you're going to miss a lot. It's just like swinging at products. You're aiming for a hit. You're going to swing a lot and a lot of times you're going to miss. That's true of marketing as well. Don't bother taking shots that never have a chance of being a hit, right? That's just a waste of time.</p>
</details>

尝试九次令人尴尬或疯狂但不起作用的事情是可以的，但那一次成功的尝试，它将被数百万人看到，你的目标受众也会在那个群体中或与那个群体相关。如果你反复这样做，它会累积，你会变得越来越好。顶级的营销，非常棒。AI在这里没有帮助的原因是，它完全关乎创造力。我从未从AI那里得到过一个好点子。即使我把它当作头脑风暴的伙伴，它也变得超级老套。它就是想不出任何酷的东西。AI做不到酷。而顶级的营销就是关于酷。这听起来像是一种与生俱来的东西，但它是一种可以学习的技能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, it's okay to try nine times on something embarrassing or crazy and doesn't work, but that one that hits, it's going to be seen by a million people and your target audience is going to be in that group or connected to that group. Uh, and if you repeat this over and over, that compounds, you get better at it. Top level marketing, amazing. The reason AI doesn't help here is it's all about creativity. I have not had a single good idea come out of AI. Even [snorts] when I use it as like a brainstorming partner, it like just gets super corny. Uh just it just can't come with anything that's cool. Like it you can't do cool. Uh and top level marketing is about is about cool. And that sounds like an innate thing, but it is a skill that that you can learn.</p>
</details>

### Aha时刻：消除摩擦

好了。现在你已经吸引了某人的注意力，他们对你正在做的事情感兴趣。接下来要弄清楚的是如何让他们达到**Aha时刻**（Aha Moment: 用户首次体验到产品核心价值并被其吸引的瞬间）。如果你想到那些伟大的产品，总有一个时刻，你与产品进行了某种互动，然后它就“点击”了。你明白了它的核心价值，你被它说服了。你觉得“这太棒了”。即使它不适合你，你可能也会想：“这不适合我，但这足够酷，如果我认识适合它的人，我一定会推荐给他们。”这就是Aha时刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So now that you have someone that is interested in what you're doing, you got their attention. The next thing to figure out is how to get them to the aha moment. So, if you think about great products, there's a moment where you've had a certain interaction with the product where it clicked for you. You got what it was about. You were sold on it. Uh, and you're like, "This is awesome." And even if it wasn't for you, you might think, "This isn't for me, but this is cool enough that if I know someone that it is for, I'm going to recommend it to them." So, that is the aha moment.</p>
</details>

你需要弄清楚你的产品中独特的Aha时刻是什么，并无情地消除所有摩擦，以尽快让用户达到那个Aha时刻。所以这里的挑战是，你可能会觉得“哦，我的应用里有很多很棒的功能。我想让他们了解功能A、B、C。”你必须非常残酷。你必须忍痛割爱。你必须选择最重要的那个，并降低其他所有功能的优先级，审视用户到达那里所需的每一个步骤，并将其削减。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You need to figure out what is the singular aha moment in your product and eliminate friction ruthlessly to get someone to that aha moment as fast as possible. So the challenges here are you might feel like oh there's a lot of good features in my app. You know I want them to know about features A B C. You you have to be brutal. You kind of have to like you know kill your children here. You have to pick the one that matters the most and deprioritize everything else and look at every single step that it's going to take for someone to get there and cut it.</p>
</details>

当我使用产品时，比如有人给我发消息说“哦，我正在开发这个东西，让我试试看。”我感到一种极度的痛苦，因为我看到了在甚至理解他们在做什么之前，需要经历的所有步骤。我知道在每一步，他们都会流失10%或20%的用户。我知道最终能坚持下来的人数非常少，甚至在我们讨论你正在构建的东西是否有用之前。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When I use products, like when someone sends me like, oh, like I'm building this thing, let me try it. The feeling like I get this crazy amount of pain cuz I see all the steps that it takes before I even get to the point where I even understand what the heck they're doing. Uh, and I know that at each point they're losing 10% of their people, 20% of their people. And I know that the percentage of people making it to the end are so small before we can even talk about whether, hey, is the thing you're building that useful?</p>
</details>

这又是几乎没有公司能理解的一点，对吧？想想当你注册某个东西时，在你甚至不知道自己是否想要这个东西之前，他们就问一些愚蠢的问题：“你的公司有多大？你有多少员工？你的头衔是什么？”谁在乎这些？你必须把所有这些都删掉，才能让人们达到你关心的那个时刻。如果你能做到这一点，你就能打造出一个真正开始腾飞、真正开始自我增长的产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, this is another thing that almost no companies get, right? Like, think about when you're signing up for something, they ask such stupid up front before you even know if you want the thing. They're like, "How big is your company? Like, how many employees do you have? What's your title?" like who cares about any of this? You got to cut all of that out to get people to the moment that that you care about. And if you're able to do this, that's how you build a product that, you know, really starts to take off, uh, really starts to grow itself.</p>
</details>

你为顶级营销所做的一切工作，如果只有3%的人能达到Aha时刻，那么，你知道，那完全是浪费。另一个难点是，也许你甚至没有一个Aha时刻。这会让你深入思考：“我到底在建造什么？我在做什么？这值得我付出努力和痛苦去建造吗？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All that work you did for the top level marketing, if only like 3% of people are getting to the aha moment, uh, you know, that that's a total waste. The the hard part, the other hard part is like maybe you don't even have an aha moment. Um, that makes you think a lot about, hey, what am I even building? What am I doing? Is is this is this worth the effort and pain of trying to build something. Uh, and I think it's worth</p>
</details>

我认为值得看看有史以来最成功的一些产品。其中一些产品拥有非常非常疯狂的Aha时刻，对吧？想想**ChatGPT**，我认为它是我们有生之年出现过的最成功的消费级产品。它提供一个输入框，你可以输入任何内容，然后你会得到一个类似人类的回复。你可以输入世界上任何东西。那是一个令人难以置信的Aha时刻，对吧？当你看到那一刻，即使是世界上最笨的人也能使用它，他们会说：“是的，这太棒了。我明白了。”它非常有吸引力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">looking at some of the most successful products of all time. Uh, some of them have some like crazy crazy aha moments, right? You think about chat GPT, which is the most successful product, I would say, consumer product ever that has existed in in our lifetime. uh they give you an input box where you can type anything and you're going to get like a humanlike interaction as a response. Like literally anything in the world you can type. That's like an insane aha moment, right? The moment you see that, like the dumbest person in the world can use that, they can be like, "Yeah, this is awesome. I get it." Uh it's very very very compelling.</p>
</details>

在社交媒体方面，对吧？你有像**Facebook**这样的产品。你喜欢一个人，你可以给你的暗恋对象发送一个“戳一下”，这有点像调情但又可以否认。这是一个即时的Aha时刻，你被这个产品吸引了，你会继续使用它。所以这些都是非常极端的例子，但每个产品都应该有一个独特的时刻，让你觉得“这就是我存在的理由。这就是我们做这一切的理由。”体验过它的人都应该明白。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh on the social media side, right? You have something like Facebook. uh you have a crush and you can like send a poke to your crush where you're like kind of flirting but it's deniable. Instant aha moment like you are sold on this product. You're going to keep using it. Um so those are like very extreme examples but every product should have a singular moment where you're like this is the reason I exist. This is the reason why we're doing all of this. Uh people that experience it should get it.</p>
</details>

再说一次，AI无法帮助解决所有这些问题的原因，又回到了创造力和真正理解这个领域。花大量时间思考它，获得清晰的思路，思考定位，思考你正在做的独特之处，而其他人都没有做。所有这些都非常非常困难。你知道，仅仅因为我们有AI可以交谈，它并不会突然让你成为一个创造惊人Aha时刻的赢家。世界上很少有人擅长这一点，他们会继续这样做，并继续超越我们其他人。所以，这又是我们别无选择，只能努力擅长的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, again, the reason why AI doesn't help with any of this is, again, it goes back to creativity and really understanding this space. Uh, spend a lot of time thinking about it, [clears throat] like gaining clarity, like thinking about positioning, uh, thinking about what you're doing unique that nobody else is doing. All very, very hard. You know, just cuz we have AI that we can talk to, it's not suddenly going to turn you into a winner at making like, you know, amazing aha moments. the people that are good at that very very few people in the world are going to keep doing that and keep crushing the rest of us. Uh so again another thing that we have no choice but to try to get good at.</p>
</details>

### 用户留存：构建可扩展的原语

漏斗模型的最后一部分是留存。假设你已经吸引了某人的注意力。你成功地让他们达到了Aha时刻。他们喜欢你正在做的事情。他们现在正在使用你的产品。你如何让他们终身留存？你如何永远留住一个客户？如果你不能永远留住客户，你就会不断流失用户，你的业务就会达到瓶颈，那将不会有趣。当你一方面增长，另一方面却在流失时，这很令人恼火。你真的希望终身留住用户，这样你服务的客户数量会随着时间推移而复合增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the last part of this funnel is the retention side. So let's say you've gotten the attention of someone. You managed to get them to the aha moment. They like what you're doing. They're now like using your product. How do you retain them for life? Like how do you get a customer forever? Uh if you aren't getting customers forever, you're just leaking people through and you're going to hit a ceiling on your business and it's not going to be fun. Like it's it's annoying when you grow on one side but you're leaking on the other side. You really want to get people for life. So that number of customers you're serving is compounding over time.</p>
</details>

留存很有趣，因为你必须以与前两个阶段不同的方式来思考它，因为它完全关乎高级用户。对吧？它完全关乎那些使用你的产品一段时间，并不断突破其极限的人。他们希望产品更具可配置性。他们希望拥有更高级的功能。你有团队在使用它。你有大型企业在使用它。他们有非常具体的需求。你如何构建能够支持所有这些需求的东西，同时又不牺牲我们在前两个阶段所做的一切，即保持简单，拥有一个非常流畅的初始体验？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um retention is interesting because you have to think about it kind of differently than the last two phases because it's all about power users, right? It's all about someone that's using your product for a while that's pushing the limits of what they can do with it. They want things to be more configurable. Uh they want more advanced features. You have uh teams using it. You have larger enterprises using it. They have very specific needs. How do you build things that support all of that without sacrificing all the stuff we did in the first two phases of keeping things simple, having a very streamlined initial first experience? Uh it's hard to juggle both of these both of these things.</p>
</details>

我们之所以被迫思考这个问题，是因为我们一直在做开源工作，对我个人而言，这已经有五六年了。开源产品很有趣，因为它们既被随机的个人爱好者使用，他们只想要一些简单、免费且可用的东西。但开源项目也是大型企业公司的最佳选择之一，对吧？这些巨头公司通常希望自己运行一切。他们希望自己托管一切。他们对数据流向其他地方非常敏感。所以开源项目需要同时支持非常简单的情况和非常高级的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh we've kind of been forced to think about this because we have been doing open source work uh for me personally it's been like five or six years now. Um open source products are interesting because they are used by both like a random indiv individual hobbyists that just want something that they can use uh that's simple and free and whatever. Uh but also open source projects are some of the best choices for like mega enterprise companies, right? These giant companies uh typically want to run everything themselves. They want to host everything themselves. They're very sensitive about uh data going anywhere else. Uh so open source projects have this requirement of supporting both like the really simple case and both the really advanced case.</p>
</details>

我们处理这个问题的方式是，有一种误解认为产品要么简单，要么功能强大。他们会说“哦，我们像**Apple**一样，正在构建一个简单的体验”，但他们通常只是在构建一个功能不足的体验，然后说“哦，我们像Apple一样，因为它是一个简单的体验”。实际上，这两者之间没有取舍。你可以构建一个既简单又功能强大的体验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh the way we go about this is there's kind of this there's like this I would say misconception that products can either be simple or they can be capable and they'll say like oh we're like Apple we're building a simple experience but what they're usually doing is just building an incapable experience and they're saying that oh we're like Apple cuz it's the simple experience. There's actually no trade-off between these two things. You can build both a simple and capable experience.</p>
</details>

做到这一点的方法是，它只是前期需要更多的工作，对吧？你想到一个你想要构建的功能，它对用户很有意义。与其直接构建这个功能，你不如先构建一些可以组合成这个功能的**原语**（Primitives: 软件开发中可组合、基础且强大的功能模块）。所以你首先考虑原语层，让它们具有广泛的范围，让它们真正高级、真正强大。然后你利用这些原语来组装你的简单体验，这是99%的人会体验到的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh the way to do this, it's just it's just more work up front, right? You think about a feature you want to build that uh makes a lot of sense for users. Instead of building the feature, you kind of have to build primitives that can be assembled into that feature. So you think about the primitive layers first, make them uh pretty wide scoping, u make them really advanced, really powerful. Then you take those primitives and assemble your simple experience that 99% of people experience.</p>
</details>

按这个顺序做的好处是，当用户需求变得更复杂时，你可以让他们更直接地访问这些底层原语。他们可以变得更高级。他们可以灵活地调整你的产品，希望他们永远不需要“超越”你的产品，对吧？因为这里的关键是，你不想构建一个人们会“超越”的产品。因为你实际上是在为别人的产品充当漏斗，无论他们“超越”到什么产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh the what the nice thing about doing it in this order is when they get more complex, you can give them more direct access to these underlying primitives. They can get more advanced. They can flex and bend your product and hopefully they never need to outgrow it, right? Because the key here is you don't want to build a product that people outgrow. uh because you're effectively serving as a funnel for someone else's product, whatever they whatever they outgrow into.</p>
</details>

所以我真的很喜欢构建这样的东西：思考我们想要做的一切，并构建一套最终可以实现这些事情的原语，然后用这些原语来组装我们的产品。这也是AI对我帮助不大的另一个领域，因为它太难了，对吧？构建和尝试构建这些原语的过程，就是你如何弄清楚你需要哪些原语以及你正在尝试做什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh so I really like building things where think about like everything we ever want to do and build a set of primitives that can eventually do those things and assemble our product using those primitives. Uh this is another area where AI does not really help me because it's like so hard, right? the building and trying to build these set of primitives is how you even figure out what primitives to need primitives you need and what you're trying to do.</p>
</details>

这种探索过程，当然你可以再次与AI聊天、头脑风暴，但这并不是那种你甚至需要向AI传达你想要做什么的事情。你必须自己非常清楚地理解它，而理解你正在尝试做什么本身就是一项任务。所以，这又是打造成功产品的一个非常关键的部分。

<p class="english-text">uh that exploration process like sure you can like again chat with AI brainstorm but this isn't the type of thing that like you to even like communicate to AI what you want to do you have to understand it really well yourself and that's a task a task is to understand what you're trying to do really really well uh so this is a again a very critical part of making a successful product um</p>

AI不会突然让你在这方面变得出色，你就是做不到。这需要大量的努力、时间、精力，直到你的大脑能够完全理解你正在工作的领域，从而设计出能够适应所有这些情况的正确原语集。

<p class="english-text">AI is not going to suddenly make you amazing at it just it you just can't it takes a lot of work, time, energy, uh, until your brain can wrap its head around the space you're working to design the right set of primitives that can kind of scale to to all these situations.</p>

### 结论：伟大产品的艰辛与乐趣

好了，最后我想告诉大家的是，如果你去尝试OpenCode，并经历我刚才谈到的整个过程，你会发现很多值得批评的地方。你会觉得：“他在这里、这里、这里都没有遵循自己的建议。”之所以会这样，是因为即使我能理解所有这些东西，并且能够谈论和清晰地表达它们，但它就是很难。遵循这些建议非常困难。我认为它很容易理解。但要日复一日地很好地执行它，无法回避这样一个事实：它极其困难，需要一个人、一个团队付出巨大的努力才能让一切完美地协同工作。

<p class="english-text">All right, so the last thing I'll leave you all with is if you go and try out Open Code, uh, and you go through the full process that I just talked about, you're going to find a lot to criticize. You're going to be like, he's not following his own advice here, here, and here. And the reason that's happening is even though I can understand all this stuff and to the degree where I can talk about it and articulate it, it's just hard. It's very hard to follow this advice. It's simple to understand, I think. But executing it well daytoday, there's no getting around the fact that it's enormously difficult and it takes so much out of a person, a team to line everything up to get it all working perfectly right.</p>

AI很棒，它让我们能够做以前做不到的各种事情。但它并不能将我们从日常的痛苦中解救出来，那种努力创造伟大产品的痛苦。所以，是的，我本来想做一个关于AI的演讲，但我有点厌倦了人们觉得一切都会突然变得更容易。它们并没有变得更容易。我的生活一如既往地艰难。做一些了不起的事情一如既往地艰难。但这也是所有乐趣和意义的来源。人们担心“哦，人们会因为AI而失去任何目的。”不，那不会成为问题，因为，你知道，事情一如既往地艰难。所以我希望这能激励你，吓到你，我不知道，让你悲伤，让你快乐。我不知道你会对此作何感想，但这就是我所有想说的。谢谢大家聆听。

<p class="english-text">Uh AI is amazing and lets us do all kinds of things that we couldn't do before. Does not save us from that day-to-day pain uh in trying to make something that's great. So yeah, I wanted to do a talk that was about AI, but kind of I'm tired of people feeling like suddenly the tables are going to turn and things are going to be easier. They're not easier. My life is just as hard as it's ever been. It's just as hard as it's ever been to do something amazing. But it's also where all the fun comes from, where all the purpose comes from. And people are worried about like, oh, people are going to like not have any purpose with with AI. Uh, no, that's not going to be a problem because, you know, things are just as hard as as they ever were. So, I hope that inspires you, scares you, I don't know, makes you sad, makes you happy. I don't know how you're going to feel about this, but that's all I have. Thanks for thanks for listening.</p>
