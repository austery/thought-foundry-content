### 工作文化的现状与变革

那么，让我们从当前世界正在发生的一切以及它所带来的动荡感开始。现在似乎是一个重新评估我们与工作关系的好时机。所以，让我们先谈谈工作文化本身。您会如何描述当前的工作状态？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, let's just start with given the fact that everything is going on in the world and can feel so tumultuous. It seems like it's a great moment to just reassess our relationships with work. So, let's start by talking about work culture itself. How would you describe the current state of work?</p>
</details>

处于变动之中，而且是巨大的变动。是的。我认为，撰写这本书的部分灵感，正是认识到在过去五年里，我们都在全球范围内经历了一场相当深刻和前所未有的体验，而我们已经不同了。我们不再是以前的我们。我认为，我们所有人都在努力辨别自己希望与工作建立怎样的关系，以及希望以何种方式工作。当我们面对文化与技术、组织重组等所有正在企业机构以及我们的小型家族企业中发生的事情时，对于我们这些企业家来说，这个问题变得至关重要：我在哪里？在工作以及工作方式方面，我希望身处何处？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In flux and I would say massively in flux. Yeah. Um, and I think, you know, part of the inspiration for writing the book was really recognizing that over the last five years, we have all gone through a pretty profound and unprecedented experience on a global scale and we are different. We are not the same. Um, and there is a way in which I think all of us are trying to really discern what is the relationship I want to have with my work, what is the way I want to work. Um, and as we are, you know, sort of bumping up against all of the converging aspects of our culture with technology, with, you know, organizational restructuring, like all of the things that are happening within our corporate institutions as well as within our mom and pop shops, for our entrepreneurs out there, I think this question is front and center of like, you know, where am I and where do I want to be when it comes to my work and the way that I work?</p>
</details>

这便引出了您目前的新书《有意识的抱负》，我们今天正在讨论这本书。它在您所描述的这种格局中处于怎样的位置？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that brings us to your current book, your new book, Intentional Ambition, which we're talking about today. How is that situated in this landscape that you've laid out?</p>
</details>

所以，我把这本书称为是为那些知道自己不会走回头路，但仍在努力弄清楚如何前进的人而写的，对吗？许多人正在转型、过渡、重新调整、重组和重新组织。我们经历了一些非常根本性的转变，这些转变正在影响我们开始思考如何为进入职场培养新的条款和条件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, this is the book that I say is written for people who know they are not going back, but they're still kind of trying to figure out how to go forward, right? And many people are pivoting and transitioning and um realigning and restructuring and reorganizing. Um, and you know, there are some really fundamental shifts that we've gone through that are influencing the way in which we're starting to think about how we now, you know, cultivate these new terms and conditions for how we're going to come into the workplace.</p>
</details>

### 寻找工作中的喜悦与意图

“喜悦”是您书名中的一个词。鉴于我们许多人现在正在经历的恐惧、不确定性或焦虑，以及我们所处的工作背景，您认为我们应该如何驾驭在生活中寻找喜悦和意图？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Joy is in the title of your book. How do you think we should navigate finding joy and intention in our own lives? Um, given the fear and the uncertainty or anxiety that a lot of us are experiencing now, given the backdrop that we're working under,</p>
</details>

我认为这是一个非常根本性的问题，因为喜悦现在比以往任何时候都更成为一种优先事项。换句话说，如果我们审视疫情前后有什么不同，我们会认识到金钱并非一切。这并不意味着金钱不重要，但我认为我们的文化，以及金钱，常常是决定我们工作方式的首要驱动力，但现在它不再是首要的了。现在还有其他考量因素。其中之一是我们的健康和福祉。我们都知道，从许多人仍在与**长新冠**（Long COVID: 新冠病毒感染后持续数周、数月甚至更长时间的症状）作斗争，到我们开始更直接地谈论心理健康、福祉和焦虑，这种关于我们福祉的对话现在变得更加突出。即使对我们中的一些人来说，这仅仅意味着多做运动。另一个突出的因素是我们的幸福感。喜悦，对吗？我们又回到了这个词。我们与日常品质的关系现在比以往任何时候都更重要、更迫切。无论您是否在疫情期间找到了自己的节奏，因为您有机会居家避疫，或者您没有。换句话说，如果一切失控了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that's the big fundamental question because joy is now more of a priority than it's ever been. You know, in other words, if we sort of look at what's different between, I think even, you know, pre- pandemic versus post pandemic, uh, we are recognizing that money isn't everything. And this doesn't mean that money isn't important, but I think that there's a way in which our culture, um, has often dictated uh, and money has also been the sort of number one driver of dictating the way that we work and and it's not anymore in terms of being the number one. There are other considerations now that are also in here. Um, one of them is our health and well-being and we all know you know everything from understanding that many of us are still living with long co to understanding that there has been a um universal way in which we are starting to talk more squarely about mental health and well-being and anxiety. Um, you know, this conversation of our well-being is now more front and center. Even if for some of us it's just getting more exercise. The other thing that's front and center is our happiness. Joy, right? Here we go. Back to that word. Our relationship with the quality of our dayto-day is more important and imperative to us now than ever before. And that's whether you felt like you were able to find your groove during the pandemic because you had the opportunity to shelter in place or whether it is that you didn't. Like in other words, the wheels fell off</p>
</details>

您不得不因为倦怠、疲劳或在许多情况下是创伤而重新振作起来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and you had to kind of reel it back in because of burnout or fatigue or uh you know or trauma in many cases. And so</p>
</details>

幸福很重要，我们日常生活的品质很重要，健康和福祉很重要，目标和意义也很重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">happiness matters, quality of our day-to-day matters, health and well-being matter, purpose and meaning matter.</p>
</details>

是的，是的。但是要达到我们都追求的这些目标，显然首先要与自己进行一次重新谈判或谈判，您对此写得非常精彩。所以，我很想回到您自己的时间线，以及您是如何形成书中阐述的这个框架的。在书的早期，您分享了一个关于您在父亲去世后，为了应对悲伤而重新审视自己人生的觉醒故事。首先，您是如何回应的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. But to get to those ends that we all seek, obviously it starts with a renegotiation or a negotiation with ourselves, which you write so beautifully about. So, I'd love to go back to your own timeline and how you kind of got to this framework that is laid out in the book. Early on in the book, you share a story about an awakening that you had um that led to your own renegotiation in your life about following the grief um following the death of your father. Um and how you kind of well, first, how did you respond?</p>
</details>

### Rha Goddess的个人觉醒之路

是的，我的意思是，我的玩笑是，我在疫情之前就“辞职”了，因为我的父亲在2016年末去世了，我的姐妹和我照顾了他生命中最后的21年。所以，那对我来说是一个非常决定性的时刻。我为了避免悲伤，把自己投入到工作中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I mean, you know, my my joke is that I kind of quit before the pandemic in the sense of, you know, my father passed away in late 2016 and um you know, my sister and I had cared for him for the last 21 years of his life. So, it was a really defining moment for me and for us. And my response to avoiding the grief of that was to plunge myself into work.</p>
</details>

是的，我发现这并不是一个不常见的反应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. um which is I come to find out not an uncommon response.</p>
</details>

我只是不断地堆积工作，不断地堆积，直到我真的无法从沙发上起来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and I just kept piling it on and piling it on and piling it on and and it got to a point where literally I just could not get off the couch.</p>
</details>

我被迫真正审视是什么让我相信我不能停下来？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and I was forced to really look at what was it that had me believe that I could not stop?</p>
</details>

是什么让我相信我不能慢下来？是什么让我相信我的人性不是优先事项？这包括我是否吃饭、睡觉，以及所有我们在日常生活中需要做的基本功能性事情，以便我们能够有力地应对那些需要我们关注的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What was it that had me believe that I could not slow down? um what was it that had me believe that my humanity was not a priority? Um and that was everything from whether I ate or I slept or you know all of the sort of basic functional things that we need to do in order to even remotely show up powerfully for the things that are you know commanding and demanding our attention in the day-to-day.</p>
</details>

感谢上帝，在治疗师和教练的帮助下，当我开始解开并真正理解是什么在驱动我时，我惊讶地发现我一直无意识地背负着所有那些叙事。是的，关于我为什么必须出现、必须努力、必须证明自己、必须超越一切，以及所有那些事情，Elise。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And as I began, thank God, through the help of a therapist and a coach, as I began to unravel and really start to understand what was driving me, I was kind of floored to discover all of the narratives that I had been carrying unconsciously. Yeah. about why I had to show up and push and prove and overachieve and you know all of all of the things at least.</p>
</details>

对，对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. Right.</p>
</details>

并且要弄清楚这些信息来自何处，以及我将这些信息内化和深埋的程度，以至于我甚至没有意识到自己正在这样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and and to reckon where those messages came from and the degree to which I had so deeply ingrained and buried those messages such that I didn't even realize that that's what I was doing.</p>
</details>

### 重新定义成功

您必须重新协商的一个主要观念是成功。您能和我们谈谈这一点吗？您最初是如何看待它的，现在又是如何看待它的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of those major ideas that you had to renegotiate is success. and the idea of success. Can you talk a little uh talk us through that and how you first thought about it and how you've come to think about it now?</p>
</details>

是的，我认为对我来说，成功常常根植于成就，你完成了多少，你取得了多少，你积累了多少赞扬、荣誉、认可或支持。对我来说，有一个真实的叙事，关于我父亲的历史，他经历了**吉姆·克劳种族隔离**（Jim Crow segregation: 19世纪末至20世纪中叶美国南部各州实行的种族隔离法律和制度）的二十年，作为一名美国的黑人男性，有一个特定的叙事，关于人们会在多大程度上尊重、欣赏或看到你的努力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think for me success had often been rooted in achievement, how much you could get done, how much you could get accomplished, how much you could uh amass in terms of praise or accolades or or recognition or support. And um and there had been a real narrative for me in terms of my father's history um and coming through two decades of Jim Crow segregation that you know as a black man in America there was a particular narrative about the degree to which people would honor respect appreciate or see um you for your efforts</p>
</details>

而且它就在那里，我并不一定意识到它就在那里。我的母亲，一个南方浸信会的完美主义者，你知道，她要求一丝不苟，言谈举止得体，穿着打褶的裙子，所有这些，你知道，被压迫到极致。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and um and that was in there and I didn't necessarily realize that was in there. you know, my mother, you know, Southern Baptist perfectionist, you know, and you know, eyes dotted, tees crossed, speaking the king's English, pleated skirts, you know, all of those things, you know, pressed to within an inch of your life.</p>
</details>

哇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow.</p>
</details>

对。那就在那里。所以，我需要开始审视和调和所有我继承的关于成功意味着什么的东西，然后当然，在外部专业环境中，其他人也在机构或组织文化中设定标准，在某些情况下，有一个标准模型来指导我们，对吧，就它看起来是什么样子而言。所有这些都在那里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. That was in there. Um and so my need to start to reckon with and reconcile with you know all of the things that I had inherited about what success meant and then certainly being in external professional environments where somebody else is also in an institutional or an organizational culture setting the standard and um in some cases having a standard model to uh to us right in terms of what it looks like. All of those things were in there.</p>
</details>

是的。而且，这些都与我是否自我感觉良好无关。这些都与我是否感到某种安全感、保障感或扎实感无关。这些都与我是否感到任何归属感无关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Um, and none of it had anything to do with whether or not I felt good about myself. None of it had anything to do with whether or not I felt some sense of safety or security or grounding. None of it had anything to do with whether or not I felt any kind of sense of belonging.</p>
</details>

是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

而且，这些都与我是否觉得自己在按照自己的价值观行事、生活或工作无关。所以，我，你知道，而且，而且，而且没有休息日，对吧？所有这些都与休息日无关。所以所有这些都必须，你知道，回到本质，对吧？并且真正地，在与我的职业道德搏斗时，我必须真正地思考，对我来说成功是什么？我的幸福、我的内心平静、我的健康和福祉，包括身体、心理、情感健康和福祉，在多大程度上可以成为我考虑这个新定义时的一部分？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And none of it had anything to do with whether or not I felt like I was operating or living or working in alignment with my values. And so I, you know, and and and then no days off, right? None of it had anything to do with with any days off. And so all of that had to, you know, come back to the studs, right? And and really um in wrestling my work ethic to the ground. I had to really kind of go like what what is success for me and to what degree do I get to be a part or my happiness or my peace of mind or my health and well-being, physical, mental, emotional health and well-being. to what degree did those get to be a part of the equation when I consider this new definition?</p>
</details>

### 外部奖励与内在奖励的平衡

是的，是的。当我们谈论外部奖励与内在奖励之间的区别时，这与我们从一位TED会员那里收到的一个问题有关。所以，我很想问您Christie提出的问题，她写道：“我们如何判断自己正在追求别人的成功版本而不是自己的？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. As we talk about this distinction between external um rewards and intrinsic or internal rewards, it's related to a question that we receive from a TED member. So, I'd love to ask you the question from Christie who wrote, "What are indications we are pursuing someone else's version of success and not our own?"</p>
</details>

是的，我认为我们经常会发现自己与所取得的成就缺乏联系。所以即使我们取得了成就，你知道，我想到**冒名顶替综合症**（Impostor Syndrome: 一种心理现象，指即使有外部证据证明其能力，个体仍持续怀疑自己的成就，并害怕被揭穿为“骗子”）。我们谈论了多少冒名顶替综合症。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think one of the things that often shows up for us is we don't often feel connected so to whatever we're achieving. So even if we achieve it, you know, and I think about this in the context of imposttor syndrome and how much we've talked about imposttor syndrome,</p>
</details>

无论你是从无法内在看待自己以及你所取得的成就和付出的努力的角度来看，还是从外部角度来看，你无法在所处的环境中看到自己，这些都会引发关于归属感的问题，对吗？以及价值感。但在这种与自我连接的背景下，我们是否认识到每天出现的那个自己？我知道对我来说，我的“代表”非常活跃，你知道，就像假笑，一切都很好，一切都很好，你知道，当一切都分崩离析的时候。我认为我与真实感受的脱节程度，或者我与真实表达的脱节程度，是其中一个明显的指标，那就是什么都无法真正进入，如果这说得通的话。这是一种麻木。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">whether you're looking at it from the perspective of an inability to see yourself internally and what you accomplish and how hard you work or whether you're looking at it from the perspective of externally where you're not able to see yourself in the landscapes you're navigating and those cause questions of uh belonging, right? Um and worthiness. Um but in this context of you know being connected to ourselves do we recognize the person who's showing up every day? Um and I know that for me uh my representative was way alive and kicking, you know, like I mean the fake smile, the fine fine fine, everything's fine, you know, when it was all falling apart. Um and um and I think the degree to which I had disconnected from my true feelings or the degree to which I disconnected from my authentic expression was one of the blaring indicators in that nothing was sort of getting in if that makes sense. It was sort of the numbness</p>
</details>

对，无论发生什么，无论是美好的还是糟糕的，我在某种程度上都脱节和退出了。另一种方式，这在很多人身上都很常见，就是精疲力尽。哦，是的，我感同身受。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right no matter what was going on whether it was great or whether it was horrible in some way I had kind of disconnected and checked out. Another way and this shows up a lot for people is exhaustion. Oh yes, I relate.</p>
</details>

你知道，缺乏能量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, the lack of energy.</p>
</details>

是的。那么，接着，一旦你意识到这种区别，你就来到了这个时刻，这个你在2016年面对的十字路口。我们的TED会员Kelly S.问道：“您有什么建议？关于如何从追求他人眼中的成功转向专注于自己的定义，您有什么建议？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Well, to follow up, once you've realized this distinction, you've kind of come to this moment, this fork in the road that you confronted yourself back in 2016, our fellow TED member, Kelly S. asks, "What's your advice? What advice do you have on handling the pivot from achieving success from other people's eyes to focusing on your own definition?"</p>
</details>

### 找到你真正想要的

是的，我认为你首先要做的是弄清楚你真正想要什么。尽管这听起来像是一个简单的问题，但至少我知道对我来说，在2017年的那个时期，我不得不问自己这个问题几个月，并且真正地不断倾听，思考，哇，我到底想要什么？我之所以这样说，是因为我发现即使现在，当我与领导者交谈时，我们想要的东西常常被我们认为可接受的、可敬的、可负担的所过滤。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think the first thing you got to do is get clear about what it is that you really want. And as much as it sounds like it's an easy question, at least I know for me when I was in that period in 2017, I had to ask myself that question for a period of months and like really keep listening for like, wow, what is it that I want? And I say that because I find even now as I talk with leaders often what we want is filtered through what we think is acceptable.</p>
</details>

完全正确。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Totally.</p>
</details>

我们认为什么是值得尊敬的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What we think is respectable,</p>
</details>

我们认为什么是负担得起的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what we think is affordable.</p>
</details>

如果我们从经济稳定的角度来考虑。所以我们常常在过滤，而且，这需要时间，需要勇气，有时还需要空间来真正触及你真正想要的核心和真相。但这是最初的问题，因为一旦你能够提出并开始允许自己回答，你可能会对你发现的东西感到震惊。你想要的东西可能不像你可能正在追求的那么复杂、困难、令人不知所措或宏大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If we think about it from the context of our econ, you know, economic stability. Um, and so we're often filtering and um, and it takes time and it takes courage and it takes space sometimes to really get to the heart and the truth of what it is that you really want. But that's the beginning question because once you can ask and begin to give yourself the permission uh to answer um, you may be shocked at what you find. what you want may be not as complicated or difficult or as overwhelming or grandiose as what you may be reaching for.</p>
</details>

### 协商、放弃与再协商的框架

在您的书中，Rha，这是一个很好的过渡，因为在您的书中，您提出了一个寻找我们真正抱负、寻找我们真实自我的框架：协商、放弃和再协商。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And in your book, this is such a great segue to the book, Ra, because in your book you lay out a framework to finding our true ambition, finding our true selves, negotiation, resignation, and renegotiation.</p>
</details>

您想向我们介绍一下这些吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you want to talk us through those?</p>
</details>

是的。在我所看到的我们所经历的阶段中，特别是在我们与工作的关系中，当我们处于协商的初始阶段时，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. in the in the phases of what I've seen us navigate through, particularly in the context of our relationship to work, when we're in the beginning stage of negotiation,</p>
</details>

我喜欢称之为导航，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I like to call it aka navigation,</p>
</details>

我们是在别人的条件下谈判，我们真的在努力弄清楚如何在别人的标准下成功或取得进步。我们如何以最小的风险做到这一点？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we're kind of coming to the table on somebody else's terms and we're really trying to sort through how we can succeed or figure out how we can advance within the context of someone else's standard. And how do we do it with the least amount of risk?</p>
</details>

是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

对。这些是我们进行大量交易的地方，你知道，有些交易很小，有些交易更大，你知道，无论是我们时间或精力的交易，还是我们发型或名字发音的交易。我的意思是，我们可以一直说下去。你知道，最近有一篇**《哈佛商业评论》**（Harvard Business Review: 一本著名的商业管理杂志）文章，我记得谈到一位高管在企业界工作30年后，最终改回了她最初的名字。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. And these are the places where we're doing a lot of trading, you know, and some trades are small and some trades are bigger, you know, whether it's a trading of our time or energy or whether it's a trading of the way we part our hair or the way we pronounce our name. I mean, you know, we could go on and on and on. Um, you know, there was a recent Harvard article, I remember talking about a particular executive who finally went back to her original given name.

她一直使用一个不是她出生时的名字。所以我们一直在进行这些交易。所以，你知道，协商阶段就是导航。放弃阶段是我们要么放弃，认为事情就是这样，要么我们说再见，不再继续。我认为“再见”这一面是觉醒的阶段。然后，再协商阶段是我们开始真正考虑什么对我们来说是重要的。当我们开始审视我们真正想要什么以及什么真正重要时，什么对我们来说是必要的。我们开始审视我们真正希望对我们的家庭、我们自己、我们的社区、我们每天贡献的组织和基础设施做出什么贡献。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um going by something other than what her given name, what her birth name was. Um so these trades were making them all the time. And so you know the negotiation stage is the navigation. The resignation stage is where we sort of either give up like this is the way it is or we say peace out no more. And I think that that's the peace out side is sort of the stage of awakening. Um and then the renegotiation stage is where we start to really consider what is important to us. What is necessary for us as we start to look at what it is that we really want and what it is that really matters. And we start to look at the contribution that we really want to make to our families, to ourselves, to our communities, to the organizations and infrastructures that we uh that we, you know, contribute to on a day-to-day.</p>
</details>

当然，Rha，正如您所指出的，有时当我们重新协商或放弃时，对我们来说最难克服的障碍是那些我们内在化的障碍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But of course, RA, as you've pointed out, sometimes the barriers that prove to be the hardest for us when we are renegotiating or resigning. Um, some of the barriers that are hardest to overcome are the ones that we've internalized inside ourselves.</p>
</details>

改变我们自己的心态并接受改变可能性的第一步是什么？

<p class="english-text">What is the first step to changing our own mindsets and accepting the possibility of change?</p>
</details>

### 再协商的三个阶段：找回、重新调整与重新构想

是的。所以，在再协商过程中，我认为我们经历了三个阶段。第一个是找回，对吗？找回，这与故事息息相关。我继承了哪些故事？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, in the renegotiation process, there are three stages. that I say we move through. The first is reclamation, right? And reclaiming and that has everything to do with the stories. What are the stories that I've inherited?</p>
</details>

我采纳或自己创造了哪些故事？它们在多大程度上赋予我力量，让我以我想要的方式出现？它们在多大程度上支持我的幸福、我的福祉、我的茁壮成长？我们有机会真正决定哪些故事我们想继续传承，哪些故事我们可能想升级或更新。再协商的第二个方面是重新调整。这是一个非常重要的方面，因为它根植于我们的真实性，而真实性实际上是我们能量的一个功能。所以当我们发现自己精疲力尽时，通常在某种程度上，我们与自己脱节了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What are the stories that I've adopted or created myself? To what degree do they empower me to show up in the way that I want to show up? To what degree do they support my happiness, my well-being, my thriving? Um and we have the opportunity to really determine which ones we want to continue to carry forward and which ones we might want to upgrade or refresh. Um the second aspect of renegotiation is realigning. And this is a really important one because this is rooted in our authenticity which is actually a function of our energy. And so when we find that we are depleted, there's often some way in which we are out of alignment with ourselves</p>
</details>

并且与自己失去了完整性。我带着爱和同情心说这些，对吗？有些地方我们明知需要说“不”，却说了“是”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and out of integrity with ourselves. And I say this with love and compassion, right? There are places where we're saying yes where we know we really need to be saying no.</p>
</details>

有些事情我们在环境中容忍，但这些事情已经超出了限度，或者已经变得无法忍受。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There are things that we're tolerating in our environment that are really beyond or you know have become intolerable.</p>
</details>

有些地方我们不真实，或者我们没有说出真相。有很多原因和理由可以解释这一点。所以在重新调整的过程中，你和自己之间会有一种清算，它关乎回到你的价值观。它关乎回到你真实的自我，它关乎回到什么对你来说真正重要。然后，再协商的第三个阶段是重新构想，这就像一旦我们理清了思绪，一旦我们清理了桌面，我们与自己的价值观重新对齐，我们理解了什么重要，现在我们可以问自己，如果我们能如愿以偿，那会是什么样子？你知道，关于我们希望如何出现，特别是当我们思考我们最想在工作中以及工作方式上做出什么贡献时，它的谁、什么、何时、何地、如何以及为什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and there places where we are not in our truth or we're not speaking our truth. Um and you know there can be lots of reasons and justifications for that. So there's a reckoning with you and you that kind of happens in the realignment process and it is about coming back to your values. It is about coming back to your authentic self and it is about coming back to what really matters to you. And then the third phase of renegotiation is the reimagination, which is really like once we get clear, you know, once we've kind of cleared the deck, we've realigned with our values, we've understood what's important, now we get to ask ourselves, you know, if we had our way, what would it look like? You know, the who, what, when, where, how, and why of how we'd like to be showing up, particularly as we think about the contribution that we most want to be making when it comes to our work and the way that we work.</p>
</details>

### 寻求外部支持的重要性

既然这种再协商很大程度上需要一种清算，您通常会建议我们寻求外部帮助，比如执行教练或治疗师，来帮助我们度过这个过程吗？我会说，肯定会有一些地方你需要支持。无论是治疗师、教练，甚至只是一个社区，我发现当你与他人合作时，这项工作会非常强大。无论是亲密的专业朋友还是同事。被见证着分享你的对话，并感受到不孤独，这有一种非常强大的力量。我认为这是我最想强调的一点，对于那些可能因为目前的生活和工作状况而倾向于拿起这本书的人来说，那就是你一点也不孤独。在书中，我采访了从疫情核心时期工作的基本工人到跨国公司的首席执行官，我可以告诉你，他们的理解，他们达到的境地，他们进行再协商过程的方式，有趣的是并没有那么不同，尽管他们的背景看起来天壤之别。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Since so much of this renegotiation requires a reckoning, do you generally recommend that we seek outside help like an executive coach or a therapist to help us work through this? I would say definitely there are going to be places where you're going to want support. And whether that is a therapist, whether that is a coach, whether that just even as a community, I find that this work is really powerful when you're doing it in partnership and collaboration with others. whether that are close professional friends or colleagues. Um there's something very powerful about being witnessed as you share your conversations and feeling the sense of not aloneeness. And I think that's one of the biggest things that I want to underscore for people who might be inclined to pick up the book given where they are right now in their life and their work is that you are so not alone. In the book, I talked to everything from essential workers who were working during the heart of the pandemic to multinational CEOs and I can tell you that the uh understandings the places that they came to the ways in which they came to their own renegotiation processes interestingly were not that different even though their contexts would seem worlds apart.</p>
</details>

对吗？我们所经历的人性化本质，让我们都问自己同样的问题，让我们都审视同样的机会和挑战，当我们开始考虑这些新条款时。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right? There's something about the humanizing nature of what we experienced that had us all asking ourselves the same kinds of questions and had us all looking at the same kinds of opportunities and challenges as we start to consider these new terms.</p>
</details>

所以，获得支持是，你知道，很棒的，当然也是应该走的路。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So doing it with support is is is is you know is wonderful and certainly the way to go.</p>
</details>

### 有意识的抱负 vs. 受伤的抱负

Rha，这本书的标题是《有意识的抱负》。您能和我们分享一下您如何定义有意识的抱负与受伤的抱负吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Rob, the title of the book is intentional ambition. So would you mind sharing with us what you defined as intentional ambition versus wounded ambition?</p>
</details>

是的，受伤的抱负真的来自于采纳和遵循与你想要的东西无关的标准、条款和条件，有时甚至与你是谁无关。我们许多人在各种情境中都有过为了融入而做了一些后悔的事情，或者为了融入而做了一些我们认为长期会受益的事情。换句话说，我们做了短期牺牲，希望获得长期收益，但最终从未实现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, wounded ambition really comes from adopting and aligning with standards and terms and conditions that have nothing to do with what you want and have nothing to do even sometimes with who you are. And many of us have had experiences in various contexts where we've done things to fit in that we've regretted or where we've done things to fit in that we thought were going to benefit us in the long term. In other words, we made the short-term sacrifice hoping for the long-term gain that ultimately never arrived.</p>
</details>

所以这种内在的清算变得非常重要，因为当我们理解有时我们被给予的剧本，以及我们被教导的关于成功所必需的东西，不仅在于我们想要什么，对吧，就让它被支配而言，还在于我们如何去实现我们想要的东西。我们可能会发现，不幸的是，在这个过程中会发生很多伤害。我们对自己造成的伤害。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so this internal reckoning becomes really important because when we understand that sometimes the playbooks that we've been handed um and what we've been taught about what's necessary in order to succeed, not only in what we want, right, in terms of having that dictated to us, but also how we go about achieving what we want. We can find that unfortunately um there's a lot of harm that takes place in that process. Harm we do to ourselves,</p>
</details>

我们有意或无意地对他人造成的伤害。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">harm we do to others intentionally, sometimes unintentionally.</p>
</details>

而能够变得有意识、有觉知、真实地了解什么对我们来说是重要的，正是我们开始找回自我意识、找回自主感、找回力量的地方。这也是我们开始扩展能力，以能够以推动我们最热衷的事情发展的方式做出贡献的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and part of being able to become intentional and become aware and become true about what's important to us is where we begin to gain our sense of self back, where we begin to gain our sense of agency back, where we begin to gain our sense of power back. It's also where we begin to expand our capacity to be able to contribute in ways that move the needle on the things that we're, you know, that we feel most passionate about.</p>
</details>

是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

那么，在组织中充满激情、充满活力、真正准备好投入工作、热衷于推动事情向前发展并发挥自己的作用是什么感觉？我们能否将此视为现状的可能性，而不是我们现在正在经历的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, what is it to show up in organizations excited, turned on, really ready to get to the work at hand, passionate about wanting to move the ball forward and bringing what you bring? and and could that be could we see that as actually the possibility for the status quo instead of what it is that we're experiencing now?</p>
</details>

### 从生存驱动到喜悦驱动的抱负

当我们谈论抱负这个话题时，我们的TED会员Sofal E.提出了一个有力的问题。他写道：“当您最早的抱负是基于生存时，您如何重新定义抱负？在这种情况下，Sofal是移民、难民、第一代。”您如何才能改掉“喜悦和休息是奢侈品而不是权利”的信念？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">While we're on this topic of ambition, one of our TED members, um, Sofal E asks a powerful question. He writes, "How do you redefine ambition when your earliest ambitions were survivalbased? In this case, Sofal is immigrant, refugee, first generation." How do you unlearn the belief that joy and rest are luxuries instead of rights?</p>
</details>

是的，面对我们所继承的一切需要勇气。我在书中谈了很多这一点，因为对我来说，我的历史就是儿童奴役，对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it takes courage to confront what we've been given. And I talk about this a lot in the book because for me, my history would be child slavery, right?</p>
</details>

对。就我的祖先和长辈来到这个国家的方式而言。所以这有很多压力。而且，Elise，这甚至很困难，因为有时这种压力是由爱我们的人施加的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. In terms of exactly the way in which my you know uh ancestors and elders came came to this country. And so that's a lot of pressure. Um and and even it's difficult at least because sometimes that pressure is applied by people who love us.</p>
</details>

是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

通常是由爱我们的人施加的，他们希望我们成功，他们需要我们坚韧，需要我们有韧性，需要我们具备所有这些品质，因为他们所居住和不得不应对的世界的性质，以便生存和发展。所以摆脱生存模式，它需要什么，这不仅是心理上的对话，也是情感上的，生理上的对话。所以我们确实必须达到一个境地，即我们如何以自爱和自我关怀的方式滋养自己，使我们的神经系统摆脱战斗、逃跑和讨好模式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Often it's applied by people who love us who want us to succeed and they need us to be tough and they need us to be resilient and they need us to be all these things because of the nature of the world that they've inhabited and had to navigate in order to survive and thrive. And so getting out of survival and what does it require is not only a mental conversation, it is an emotional, it is a physiological conversation. And so we are we do have to come to the place of what are the ways in which we're nourishing ourselves in terms of self-love and self-care that enable us to move our nervous systems out of fight flight and fawn</p>
</details>

并进入扎根、平静、集中和清晰的状态。这不可避免地需要放慢速度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and into grounding and peace and centering and clarity. And that inevitably requires slowing down.</p>
</details>

所以当我说勇气时，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when I say courage,</p>
</details>

有勇气放慢速度，甚至在某些情况下有勇气停下来，是能够开始解脱的第一步，因为通常只有当我们能够放慢速度并停下来时，我们才能真正看到正在发生什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">having the courage to slow down and dare I say in some cases having the courage to stop is one of the first steps in being able to start to unhook because often it isn't until we can slow down and stop that we can actually even see what's operating.</p>
</details>

### 面对现实挑战的实用建议

让我们变得实际一些，因为现在有很多人正在挣扎。无论是他们正在努力找工作，觉得不得不接受任何能找到的工作，还是他们为了糊口而工作，觉得没有额外的时间来放慢速度、反思和理清思路，或者他们觉得因为经济原因不能辞掉一份讨厌的工作。您会给那些知道自己想要更多一致性的人什么建议？他们正在听这次对话，他们觉得“天哪，很多都与我有关”，但又害怕，你知道，这里有很多恐惧和实际问题，他们觉得他们无法克服。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's get practical though because so many people are struggling right now. Whether they're struggling to find a job and feel like they have to take anything they can get or they're working for jobs just to get by and feel like they don't have that extra time in order to slow down and get reflective and get clear or they feel as though they can't quit a job they hate because of finances. What what advice would you give to someone who knows they do want more alignment? they're listening to this conversation and they feel like gosh, a lot of this tracks for me, but fears, you know, there's lots of fears and practicalities around here um that they feel like they just can't um navigate around.</p>
</details>

是的。我认为首先要做的就是，在任何可能的程度上，开始相信这是可能的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I think the first thing is to even begin to let in to whatever degree that you can that it is possible</p>
</details>

因为这正是您所说的。我们被展示的很多东西都表明它不是。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because it's exactly what you're saying. So much of what we get shown is that it isn't.</p>
</details>

所以，关于变得实际、变得务实，对吧？让我们面对现实的对话，与我们放弃的深度以及我们对可能性的犬儒主义有关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so the conversation of get practical, get pragmatic, right? Let's get real has to do with the depth of our resignation and our cynicism about what's possible.</p>
</details>

对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right.</p>
</details>

对。所以其中一部分是，第一步是我们必须与自己在一起，并且照照镜子，与自己进行一次非常诚实的对话，关于你希望什么成为可能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. And so part of it is like the first step is we got to get with us and us and and like look in the mirror and have a really honest conversation with yourself about like what do you want to be possible</p>
</details>

你愿意相信什么有1%的可能性？你如何开始走向你认为可能的事情？放慢速度的恐惧也很普遍，因为我们害怕如果放慢速度，我们必须面对我们有多么害怕，或者我们对自己的生存有多么担忧。但事实是，不幸的是，除非我们能开始摆脱生存模式，否则很难相信或接受更多可能性。所以我常常告诉人们，就从走路开始。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and what are you willing to even like 1% believe could be possible and how do you begin to start to walk towards what you think could be possible? The fear of slowing down is also you know prevalent because we're afraid that if we slow down we have to confront how much we are afraid or how much we are concerned about our survival. But the truth of the matter is unfortunately until we can start to move out of survival it is hard to believe or open up the idea that more things are possible. So often I even tell people just start by walking.</p>
</details>

从生理上让你的身体从恐惧和惊恐中解脱出来，进入一个平静的地方。对吗？我们谈论正念。我们谈论冥想、瑜伽、亲近大自然。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Start by just phys physiologically moving your body out of a place of fear and terror into a place of calm. Right? We talk about mindfulness. We talk about meditation, yoga, time in nature,</p>
</details>

参与运动，对吗？我的丈夫对**匹克球**（Pickleball: 一种结合了羽毛球、网球和乒乓球元素的球类运动）非常着迷。所以，无论那些日常活动是什么，只要能让你摆脱思绪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">engaging in sports, right? My husband is crazy about pickle ball, right? Um, so whatever those daytoday activities are that get you out of your head,</p>
</details>

是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

进入你的身体，这可能是支持这个机会的开始，让你开始真正平静下来并扎根。然后是小步前进，你知道，所以其中一些可能从日记活动开始，你早上只是问自己，今天我能做一件事来为我的一天带来更多喜悦吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and into your body may be the beginnings of supporting this opportunity to start to really calm down and ground. And then baby steps, you know, so some of it may be starting with a journal activity where you're just asking yourself in the morning today, what is one thing I could do to bring more joy to my day?</p>
</details>

也许只是和你的孩子玩15分钟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Maybe it's just 15 minutes with your kids,</p>
</details>

在车道上来回扔球。

<p class="english-text">throwing the ball back and forth in the driveway,</p>
</details>

对吗？也许是今天好好吃顿午饭，比如你真的从办公桌前站起来，你知道我的意思，对吗？就像从非常非常简单的事情开始。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right? Maybe it's taking a real lunch today, like where you actually get up from your desk, you know what I mean, right? Like start with the very very simple things</p>

因为你越能开始滋养自己和呵护自己，你就越有空间和余地去真正想象新的可能性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because the more that you can begin to nourish yourself and nurture yourself, the more space and room you'll begin to have to really imagine new possibilities.</p>
</details>

### 挑战生产力迷思

我喜欢这一点。我们面临的挑战，以及我认为常常让人们紧抓不放的原因，Elise，是我们相信如果我们这样做，工作就会受影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I love that. The challenge we face and often what has people I think hold on so tight Elise is we believe that if we do this work is going to suffer.</p>
</details>

我们相信生产力会受影响。现在，我们有很多科学证据证明并非如此，对吗？换句话说，如果你看所有的报告，如果你看数据，如果你看GDP，对吗？就，你知道，有各种各样的研究表明，工作周较短的人实际上成就更多，对吗？如果你不是拖着自己到达终点线，生产力实际上更高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We believe that productivity is going to suffer. Now, we've got a ton of science out there that proves otherwise, right? Like we, in other words, if you look at all the reports, if you look at the data, if you look at the GDP, right? In terms of, you know, there's been all kinds of studies that people who have a shorter work week actually achieve more, right? Productivity is actually higher if you're not dragging,</p>
</details>

对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right,</p>
</details>

你自己穿越终点线。所以这关乎根深蒂固的思维，以及开始挑战那些根植于我们必须这样做，否则就完全不行的一些观念的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yourself across the finish line. And so it is about the ingrained thinking and the opportunity to to just begin to start to challenge some of those ideas that are rooted in the fact that we have to do it this way or no way at all.</p>
</details>

### 如何知道自己走在正确的道路上

我们之前谈到过，Rha，关于我们可能走错了路或脱离了正轨的迹象。我们还有一位TED会员Ryan S.提出的一个很棒的问题：“我想我知道我的职业生涯要去向何方，但我不知道如何到达那里。我怎么知道我走在正确的道路上？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We talked earlier RA about indications that we're on maybe the wrong path or out of alignment. Another great question that we have from TED member Ryan S is, "I think I know where I want my career to go, but I don't know how to get there. How do I know that I'm on the right path?"</p>
</details>

所以，我首先要说的是，一旦你有了那种清晰度，你就会开始让自己周围充满那些分享相同抱负、分享相同愿景的人。所以，一定要寻找机会获取新知识，寻找机会进行对话，无论是在线上社区还是实体社区。我认为开始分享的机会变得非常重要。但我也想说，你与谁分享也很重要。我将进一步解释我的意思。当我们有一个新想法，或者我们有一个梦想，或者我们有一个我们渴望的东西时，我们常常会找到生活中最愤世嫉俗的人去征求意见。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the first thing I'm going to say is this is that once you have that clarity, you want to be starting to surround yourself with people who share those aspirations, who share those visions. So definitely looking for opportunities to gain new knowledge, looking for opportunities to be in dialogue and whether that's in an online community or a physical community. I think the opportunity to start to share becomes really important. But I also want to say who you share with becomes important. And I'll say a little bit more about what I mean. When we have a new idea or we have a dream or we have something that we aspire to, we will often find the most cynical person in our life to go and run it by.</p>
</details>

对吗？我只是想说，你知道，我想到我们的孩子，对吧？你会让任何人抱你的新生儿吗？你知道，我们想考虑的是，当我们孕育新想法或开辟新道路时，获得水分和阳光真的非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right? And I'm just going to say like, you know, I think about this in in the analogy of of our baby like right like would you let anybody hold your newborn baby? You know, and and we want to consider that that when we're birthing new ideas or when we're charting new paths that it is really important that we get water and sunlight.</p>
</details>

绝对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely.</p>
</details>

对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right.</p>
</details>

并且我们周围都是会鼓励我们的人。即使他们不完全理解我们在做什么，如果他们愿意说：“我相信你，如果你对此充满热情，那就去做吧。”这会非常有帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that we surround ourselves with people who are going to encourage us. Even if they don't understand exactly what we're doing, if they're willing to say, "I believe in you and if you're passionate about it, go for it." Like that goes a really long way.</p>
</details>

它确实如此。我自己在生活中也确实发现过这一点。那么，当我们谈论协作和联系时，我们还没有谈到您使用的“稀缺恐惧”这个短语。我们太习惯于这种“不够”的叙事，不够的机会或工作。在没有这种稀缺心态的情况下，工作和竞争会是什么样子？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It absolutely does. I've certainly found that in my own life. Well, as we're talking about collaboration and connection, we have yet to talk about your phrase that you use called the scarcity scare. We're so conditioned to this narrative that there's not enough um and not enough opportunity or work to go around. What could work and competition look like outside of this scarcity mindset?</p>
</details>

### 摆脱稀缺心态

是的，我认为这是一个机会，可以放弃“一个人的损失就是另一个人的收获”这种信念。这是一种零和心态，不幸的是，我们仍然在许多方面受其影响。所以我们的一部分机会是真正开始思考，我们生活中“足够”的经历有哪些？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think it's the opportunity to let go of this belief that a loss for one is a gain for another. This is the zero sum mentality that unfortunately we still are in many ways navigating. And so part of our opportunity is really to start to consider like what of the experiences that we've had in our lives of enough.</p>
</details>

你知道，我在书中分享的一个故事是关于多年前我前往非洲参与一个创意项目。我们在内罗毕郊区的一个贫民窟工作，那是一个非常非常艰难的地区。我们大概有20位艺术家和音乐家挤在一个小小的三居室公寓里，对吧？正在制作这张合作专辑。到了吃饭的时候，只有一个慢炖锅。每天他们都会去市场。我们把钱凑在一起。他们会带回来几捆蔬菜、一些玉米粉。

<details>

<p class="english-text">You know, one of the things I share in the book is a story about traveling to Africa on a creative project many, many years ago. And we were working in a township outside of Nairobi, a really, really rough uh and difficult region and area. And we were, you know, probably 20 artists and musicians packed into this little like three room apartment complex, right? Working on this collaborative album. And when it came time to eat, there was like just this crock pot. And every day they would, you know, come in for the market. We pull our money and put all our money together. And they would come back with like uh a few bushels of uh greens, some cornmeal</p>

和一小块肉来调味。

<p class="english-text">And the magic that Anthony was was sort of our resident cook. and the magic that Anthony was able to create with that crockpot.</p>
</details>

但更深刻和感人的是，每个人都吃到了饭。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But what was even more profound and moving was the assurance that everybody ate.</p>
</details>

无论我们是否有足够的锅碗瓢盆，这都不重要，人们分享盘子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Whether we had enough pots or or dishes to go, it didn't m people shared plates.</p>
</details>

人们把食物舀到手上，确保圈子里的每个人都有东西吃。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">People spoon food into hands to ensure that everybody in the circle had something.</p>
</details>

是的。每当我们有过那种每个人都被看到、被关怀、被照顾的经历时，它们都改变了我们的人生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And anytime we've had those experiences where everybody's been seen and everybody's been cared for and catered to in some level, they've been lifech changing for us.</p>
</details>

所以我们的机会是，当我们进入我们所占据的空间时，当我们有能力以各种方式领导和影响时，即使没有头衔，我们如何为每个人创造空间，让每个人都能茁壮成长，并挑战“必须有赢家和输家”的叙事？这是我认为我们现在正在治愈和转变的最大问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So our opportunity is to start to look at as we come into the spaces that we occupy, as we have the ability to lead and influence in all of the ways that we can lead and influence outside of a title. How are we making room? How are we creating space where everybody can thrive and and challenging the narrative that there has to be winners and losers? That's the biggest thing that I think we're healing and transforming right now.</p>

### 职业生涯后期和退休后的目的重塑

好的，Rha，我有一个问题，是为那些处于职业生涯后期或即将退休的人准备的。有人写信说他们已经70多岁了，觉得好像自己已经没有什么故事可讲了。所以，我想知道您会如何回应这个问题，以及在工作生涯结束时重新构想自己人生目标的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, Ra, I've got a question for those who are listening in in later stages of their careers or entering retirement. Someone wrote in and said that they're in their mid70s and felt like they didn't really have a story anymore. So, I wonder how you would respond to this and to the question of having to reimagine your purpose at the end of a working life.</p>
</details>

是的，当我走遍全国时，除了有幸参与像这样的平台和舞台之外，我们还在社区举办晚宴。我可以告诉您，就在两周前，我们在洛杉矶的一个社区，圈子里的一位绅士即将80岁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, as I've been traveling the country, in addition to having the privilege to do platforms and stages very much like this one, we've been doing dinners in communities. And I will tell you just two weeks ago we were in Los Angeles with a community and one of the gentlemen in the circle was turning 80</p>
</details>

他正在思考同样的问题，因为人们一遍又一遍地问他，80岁感觉如何？他注意到自己会不自觉地想要谈论自己的病痛。你知道，那些昨天还管用但今天却不管用的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and he was pondering the very same question because people were asking him over and over again what what does it feel like to be 80? And he noticed the automatic sort of uh temptation to want to go to his aches and pains. You know the things that worked yesterday but are not working today.</p>
</details>

对吧，他就是这样描述的，就身体而言。但他认识到并说的一件事是，你知道，我意识到时间是我可以为自己做出的选择，我可以决定接下来的10年将是什么样子。70到80岁之间的过去10年非常棒。我认为这种观念，你可以拥有更多的生命。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right? The way he described it, right, in terms of the bodily um but one of the things that he recognized and said was, you know, I realize that time is a choice that I can make for myself and I can decide what what these next 10 years are going to be like. The last 10 years between 70 and 80 were amazing. And I think this idea that you can have more life</p>
</details>

你可以拥有更多的喜悦，你可以像孩子一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and you can have more joy and you can um you can be childlike</p>
</details>

即使在你的第二或第三幕中，这也是我认为我们至少现在正在考虑的另一个部分。所以他说他花了几周时间才想出一个好的答案。但他说：“你知道，现在当人们问他，80岁感觉如何？”他说：“等我90岁的时候再问我，因为那时我就可以告诉你过去10年我所做的所有伟大的事情了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">even in your second or third act is another part of where I think we are at least right now when we're considering. And so he said it took him a couple of like weeks to really come up with a good answer. But he said, "You know, when people now ask him, how does it feel to be 80?" He says, "Ask me when I'm 90 because then I can tell you all the great things I've done over the last 10 years."</p>
</details>

是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

对。所以每个时刻都在发现新事物。所以我想邀请您的冒险精神，现在比以往任何时候都更需要它，因为您有很多智慧可以分享，而且您可能还有很多世界要看。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. So each moment discovering new things. So I want to invite your adventure, your sense of adventure now more than ever because you got a lot of wisdom to share and you still probably have a lot of world to see.</p>
</details>

绝对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely.</p>
</details>

允许自己这样做。这次对话充满了故事，我们告诉自己的故事，我们继承的故事，以及我们在再协商之后为自己建立和塑造的故事。所以，在这次对话之前，Rha，您与我们分享了几个问题，供TED社区思考，您问道：“你告诉自己关于你在生活中或工作中地位的哪个故事不再为你服务了？你想要讲述的新故事是什么？你认为你在哪些方面正在努力实现它？”非常棒的提示，非常深思熟虑。在我们分享大家提交的一些内容之前，Rha，您介意简单分享一个您自己的故事例子吗？关于一个可能不再为您服务的故事，以及您是如何找到新故事的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Giving yourself permission to do that. This conversation has been full of stories and the stories that we tell ourselves, this the ones that we inherit, the ones that we build and shape for ourselves after a renegotiation. So, in the leadup to this conversation, Rah you shared a few questions with us for the TED community, and you asked, "What is a story you tell yourself about your place in life or at work that's no longer serving you? What is the new story that you want to be able to tell instead? In what ways do you think you're struggling to get there? Really great prompt, very thoughtful. And before we share some of what y'all submitted, Ra, do you mind just briefly sharing an example of your own story with us about a story that maybe stopped serving you and how you found your new one?</p>
</details>

### Rha Goddess的个人故事：从“修复一切”到“自我关怀”

是的。当我在2017年崩溃时，我清楚地意识到我一直秉持着一种叙事，认为我有责任修复周围所有错误的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. When I had my breakdown in 2017, one of the things that became really clear to me was that I was holding a narrative that said I was responsible for fixing everything that was wrong around me.</p>
</details>

我们中的一些人可能会有同感，对吗？你在家里被认为是负责任的人。在你的圈子里，你被认为是总能及时伸出援手，为每个人、每件事提供正确帮助的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And some of us may relate to this, right? You're known as the responsible one in your family. You're known as the one in your circle that always comes to the rescue with just the right thing for everything and everybody everywhere.</p>
</details>

而我必须对自己说实话的是，这太累了。无论我多么关心，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what I had to tell the truth about for myself was that it was exhausting. As much as I cared,</p>
</details>

以及我多么觉得我必须证明我关心，这正在为我创造一个无法管理的生活，因为我不可能同时出现在所有地方，对每个人都面面俱到。这根本不可能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um, and as much as I felt like I had to prove I cared, um, it was creating a life that was unmanageable for me because there was no way that I could be everywhere and be everything to everyone all of the time. It's just impossible.</p>
</details>

是的。所以我必须为自己创造的新故事是，承认关爱世界的一部分也包括关爱我自己。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And so the new story I had to create for myself was one that acknowledged that part of caring for the world is caring for myself, too.</p>
</details>

并确保我能拥有健康和茁壮成长所需的一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">And making sure that I could have what I needed to be healthy and thriving.</p>
</details>

是的。这样我就可以做出健康的决定，关于我会在哪里出现，以及什么是我的责任，同时尊重和敬重那些不属于我的责任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. so that I could then make healthy choices about where I would show up and what was mine while honoring re and respecting what wasn't mine.</p>
</details>

是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

对。所以这关乎设定界限。这关乎真正关爱自己。而那个新的口头禅，那个新的表达方式，那个新的叙事，正是给了我开始这样做的许可。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. So that was about setting boundaries. That was about really caring for me. And that new mantra, that new way of articulating that new narrative is what gave me the permission to start to do that.</p>
</details>

### 社区成员的提问与Rha Goddess的建议

多么强大的解锁。太棒了，Rha。非常感谢您的分享，也感谢我们的TED社区提交的问题。我们收到了许多深思熟虑的回答，我希望我们能分享所有这些，但Rha已经审阅了它们，并选择了一些她想回应的。所以，这是Ozgushi的第一个问题，他写道：

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What a powerful unlock. That's awesome, Ra. Um, thank you for sharing and thank you to our TED community for submitting. We had so many thoughtful answers to this prompt and I wish we could share them all, but Rah has reviewed them and chosen a few that she would like to respond to. So, here's the first one from Ozgushi who wrote,</p>
</details>

“我学的是健康专业，并成功毕业。在那个系学习时，我总是哭泣，因为我不快乐。但我只是因为家人希望我这样做而努力坚持。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">"I studied in the health department and graduated successfully. I've always cried when I was studying in that department because I wasn't happy. But I tried to keep going just because my family wanted me to.</p>
</details>

我为了他们的骄傲和认可而活。毕业后，我患上了重度抑郁症，并在医院住了一段时间。之后，我决定为自己而活。我开始为我梦想的专业学习。目前，我是一名26岁（11月将满27岁）的二年级大学生。我现在感觉自己是个负担，因为我没有赚钱。我没有工作，但在学习期间找不到任何工作。我想取得好成绩，但有时我觉得自己做错了什么，我应该放弃并开始做任何工作。所以，我主要因为经济问题和由此引起的心理问题而挣扎。尽管如此，我不想放弃，因为我觉得生活是一段旅程。即使我迟了，即使我做错了什么，我知道我会从中学习。最后，我想说我没有放弃。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was living for their pride and acceptance. After graduation, I had major depression and stayed at a hospital for a while. After that, I decided to live for myself. I started to study for my dream department. And currently, I'm a second grade university student at age 26, 27 in November. I feel like I'm a burden now because I'm not making money. I'm not working, but I can't find any job while studying. I want to have high grades, but sometimes I feel like I'm doing something wrong and I should just quit and start to work at any job. So, I'm mostly struggling because of economic issues and the mental problems that this causes. Still, I don't want to give up because I feel like life is a journey. Even if I'm late, even if I'm doing something wrong, I know that I will learn from it. And in the end, I want to say I didn't give up</p>
</details>

而且我正在做让我快乐的事情。嗯，是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and that I'm doing what makes me happy. Mhm. Yeah.</p>
</details>

所以，我将带着爱心提供给你的口头禅是，它邀请你相信你可以做你喜欢的事情，并且你可以很好地照顾自己，在你喜欢的事情中得到很好的照顾。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the mantra that I would lovingly offer to you is one that invites you to believe that you can do what you love and that you can take care of yourself like be well taken care of in what you love.</p>
</details>

这并不意味着你必须牺牲，你可以做你喜欢的工作。你可以追求你喜欢的领域，并且你可以得到很好的照顾。美妙之处在于你身处一个教育环境，你正在学习。所以其中一个机会可能是，与那些已经做到这一点、走过这条路并围绕它创造了职业或事业的人坐下来交谈，并对你所在领域中其他人的道路和旅程感到好奇。但再次强调，这始于开始使用那个新的叙事和新的对话，比如我可以做我热爱并打动我内心的事情。我可以在我想要工作的领域工作，并且我可以照顾好自己，并且在我这样做的时候得到很好的支持和关怀。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That doesn't mean that you have to sacrifice that you can do work that you love. You can pursue the field that you love and you can be well taken care of. The beauty is that you're in an environment, an educational environment where you're learning. So one of the opportunities might be is to sit with other people who have done it, who have walked that path and who have created a career or a field of endeavor around that and become curious about other people's paths and journeys who are in your field. But again, it starts with starting to work with that new narrative and that new conversation like I can do what's passionate uh and moves my heart. I can work in the field that I want to work in and I can take care of myself and I can be well supported and cared for as I do it.</p>
</details>

非常感谢。好的，下一个问题来自Kim H.，他写道：“我准备改变的旧故事是，我必须承担一切才能让它有意义。多年来，我一直相信我的影响力直接取决于我独自承担了多少。”这听起来像您，Rha。如果我放慢速度或寻求帮助，旧版本的您，当然，如果我放慢速度或寻求帮助，愿景就会缩小或停滞。这个故事推动了进步，但也导致了倦怠、孤立和一种无声的恐惧，即我总是落后一步。新故事是，我正在建立系统、团队和社区，让目标通过我实现，而不是依赖我。我想从一种与能量对齐的状态中领导，而不是义务。我希望我的工作感觉像与生活的协作，而不是与时间的赛跑。是什么阻碍了我？我擅长战略和执行，但放手控制、深度授权以及真正信任他人完成使命仍然感觉像是一种风险。我正在努力摆脱“烈士心态”，同时仍然保持高标准。这是我目前的挑战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you so much. Okay, our next one is from Kim H who wrote in and says, "The old story I'm ready to change. I have to carry it all to make it matter. For years, I've believed that my impact is directly tied to how much I shoulder alone." This sounds like you, Ra. that if I slow down or ask for help, the old version of you, of course, that uh that if I slow down or ask for help, the vision will shrink or stall. This story has fueled progress, but also burnout, isolation, and a quiet fear that I'm always one step behind. The new story, I'm building systems, teams, and communities that let purpose move through me, not depend on me. I want to lead from a place of aligned energy, not obligation. I want my work to feel like a collaboration with life, not a fight against the clock. What's blocking me? I'm good at strategy and execution, but letting go of control, delegating deeply, and truly trusting others with the mission still feels like a risk. I'm navigating how to release the martyr mindset while still holding the bar high. That's my edge right now.</p>
</details>

是的。所以你可以带着并开始使用的口头禅是：我从灵感中领导，并得到周围人的充分支持。我带着同情心和责任感领导，我能够以卓越的姿态站立，并被我的合作者充满爱意和喜悦地接纳。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So the mantra that you can walk with and start to work with is that I lead from inspiration and am fully supported by those around me. I lead with compassion and accountability that I can stand in excellence and be lovingly joyfully met by those I collaborate with.</p>
</details>

所以再次，利用这个口头禅和故事的背景也邀请你与你的合作者进行透明和明确的沟通。分享你的恐惧，但也分享你的愿景。你希望如何工作，你希望它是什么样子。你希望他们在哪些方面与你合作。倾听他们的愿景。他们对工作方式有什么希望，他们可以以何种方式与你合作？并创造一个共同的愿景、共同的承诺和一套共同的协议，使你能够释放更多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so again, the context in being able to utilize this mantra and story then also invites you to be in transparent communication and explicit communication with the people that you're collaborating with. Sharing your fears, but also sharing your vision. The way you'd like to work, the way you'd like it to be. The places where you'd like to have them partner with you. Hear their visions. What are their hopes around the way that they'd want to work and in what way could they partner with you? And creating a shared vision and a shared commitment and a shared set of agreements that enables you to release more.</p>
</details>

是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

</details>

太棒了。太棒了。好的。最后一个问题来自Jeannie J.，她写道：“不再为我服务的旧故事是，我意识到自己倾向于低估或贬低自己的专业知识和贡献，这有时限制了我在专业上获得认可和机会。”我想要讲述的新故事是：我正在踏入一个清晰、自信、有意义影响的专业叙事，我的专业知识和热情与丰富的机会、职业发展和职业成就无缝衔接。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wonderful. Wonderful. Okay. One last one is from Jeannie J who writes, "Story no longer serving me is, I've recognized a tendency to undervalue or minimize my own expertise and contributions which has sometimes limited the recognition and opportunities available to me professionally." New story I want to tell. I'm stepping into a professional narrative of clarity, confidence, and meaningful impact where my expertise and passion align seamlessly with abundant opportunities, career advancement, and professional fulfillment.</p>

</details>

有人听到我在说什么吗？然而，当涉及到想要吸引我们想要的机会，或者那些对我们有意义的机会时，我们能够分享我们所带来的东西，能够认识到，能够谦卑地尊重我们所带来的东西，这很重要。所以，任务是实际写下：我带来了什么。我想要带来什么，我的热情，我的技能，我的才能，然后坚持住。当我坚守我的价值时，我允许绝佳的机会流向我。

And yet, when it comes to wanting to attract the kinds of opportunities that we want or the kinds of opportunities will make a difference to us, it's important that we be able to share what we bring, be able to recognize, be able to humbly honor what we bring. And so, the assignment is to actually write out here's what I bring. Here's what I want to bring, my passion, my skills, my talents, and then stand in.

### 保持积极路径的根本实践

这是一种实践，我要对你们所有人说，当我们审视旧现实和新现实之间的桥梁时，有四件事我认为至关重要，我不想粉饰它们。首先是勇气。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is a practice and I'm going to say to you all like, you know, when we're looking at bridging between the old reality and the new reality, there are four things that I think are are crucial and I don't want to sugarcoat them. The first is courage.</p>
</details>

愿意走出我们的舒适区，为我们想要成长的领域做出贡献和荣耀。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">being willing to step outside of our comfort zone in contribution and in honor of the places where we want to grow.</p>
</details>

第二是耐心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second is patience.</p>
</details>

它可能不会一夜之间发生。有些事情会比其他事情进展得快。对吗？有些事情会更固执。但即使我们能朝着我们想要做出的改变迈出小步，我们仍在前进，对吗？任何进步都是进步。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It may not happen overnight. Some things are going to move quicker than other things, right? Some things are going to be a little bit more stubborn. But even if we can take baby steps in the directions of the changes we want to make, we're still moving, right? any progress is still progress.</p>
</details>

第三是许可。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The third is permission.</p>
</details>

我们在哪些地方告诉自己我们不能？我们有很多理由和经验来强化我们不能。但再次强调，我们可以在哪里给自己许可，走出任何将我们困在特定现实中的叙事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Where are the places we're telling ourselves that we can't? And we've got lots of justifications and lots of experiences that reinforce that we can't. But again, where is one place where we can give ourselves permission to step outside of whatever narrative that's been keeping us boxed into a particular reality. M</p>
</details>

Manoj，保持正直，按照你的价值观行事，是我们更真实地展现自己的方式。它赋予我们更大的领导能力，而且我们可以以一种不具对抗性的方式做到这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">having integrity operating in your values manoj is the way in which we get to really show up more authentically as ourselves. It gives us more capacity to lead and we can do that in a way that's not antagonistic.</p>
</details>

第四也是最后一点是实践。所以每天，我能练习什么能给我带来更多喜悦、更多平静、更多自由、更多清晰、更多成就感？每天一件事。我能练习什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The fourth and final thing is practice. So every day, what can I practice that brings me more joy, more peace, more freedom, more clarity, more fulfillment? One thing every day. What can I practice?</p>

<p class="english-text">[Music]</p>
</details>

所以，关于趋势的第一点是，真正扎根于对你最有意义的东西。有时趋势的某些方面可能非常鼓舞人心，有时趋势的某些方面我们知道可能非常疏远。所以其中一部分是真正审视，当我思考我自己的创造力，我自己的想象力时。有没有我想共同创造的东西，但我想找到自己的方式去做，这通常是我听到的，对吗？比如，我不一定对人工智能感到愤怒，对吗？尽管我们中的一些人可能会，但我想弄清楚如何以我的方式去做，你知道，对吗？我的方式是什么？所以，有些东西是关于给自己许可，以一种真正邀请你的真实性和清晰度的方式来对待任何新的、热门的或有趣的事物。第二部分是，我认为这将越来越成为常态，那就是回到社区，回到圈子里，我们尊重并欣赏社交媒体的作用。在网络世界中，我们以某种方式获得了我们无法获得的东西。但也有一些东西是关于坐在草地上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the first one in terms of trends is the opportunity to really ground in what is most meaningful to you. Sometimes there are aspects of trends that can be very inspiring and sometimes there are aspects of trends which we know can be very alienating. And so part of it is really looking at when I think about my own creativity and I think about my own imagination. Are there things that I want to co-create with, but I want to find how to do them my way, which is often what I hear at least, right? Like, I'm not mad at AI necessarily, right? Though some of us might be, but I want to figure out how to do it my way, you know, right? And what is my way? Um, so there's something about giving yourself permission to really approach whatever may be new or hot or interesting in a way that really invites your authenticity to the table and your clarity to the table. The second part is, and I think that this is going to become more and more the case, coming back to being in community, being in circle, we respect and appreciate that social has a role to play. There are ways in which we get access to things we wouldn't in an online world. But there also is something about sitting in the grass,</p>

对，和你的当地社区步行邻里小组在一起，对吗？与人们在共享空间中相处，这也是你生活中一个重要的方面，不要低估被看到和拥有人际面对面连接的价值。

<p class="english-text">right, with your local community walk neighborhood group, right? There's something about being with people in shared space that also is an important aspect to your life and not underestimating the value of being seen and the value of having that humanto human inperson connection.</p>

好的，太棒了。Jennifer S.问道：“取得成就可能很有趣。我们如何才能达到那种有趣的水平，而又不至于过度追求成就，达到不健康的水平？成就不足会让人感到不满足。”

<p class="english-text">Okay, lovely. Jennifer S asks, "Achieving can be fun. How do we aim for that fun level without spilling over to an unhealthy level of achievement? Underachchieving can feel unfulfilling.</p>

是的。关注你的能量。这是关于对齐的对话。有目的的努力没有错。鼓舞人心的追求没有错。但如果它达到了一个程度，你发现你在拖着自己，或者你发现你在责备自己，或者你发现你在给自己施加不必要的压力，并且它正在产生焦虑，或者它正在产生恐惧，或者它正在产生怀疑。我会说你有点过头了。这是一个美丽的区分，来自于Gail Stra和David Gerson的作品，他们称之为**成长边缘**（Growing Edge: 指个人在舒适区之外，但又未达到完全恐惧和退缩的区域，是学习和成长的最佳地带），即我们找到那个我们成熟并准备好改变的地方。换句话说，我们不是强迫任何事情，这会让我们感到恐惧和束缚，但我们也不是停留在舒适区。那么，那个恰到好处的伸展区域在哪里，对吗？你正在投入。这不舒服。这是新的。你正在弄清楚事情。有兴奋感。有冒险感。有好奇心。有敬畏感。有惊奇感。然后注意什么时候它向任何一个方向倾斜，你就有机会开始重新校准。

<p class="english-text">Yeah. Pay attention to your energy. This is the alignment conversation. There's nothing wrong with purposeful effort. There's nothing wrong with inspirational pursuit. But if it gets to a point where you find you're dragging yourself or you find you're beating up on yourself or you find you're putting undue pressure on yourself and it's producing anxiety or it's producing fear or it's producing doubt. I'm going to say you're a little over your edge. And this is a beautiful distinction that comes from the work of Gail Stra and David Gerson called the growing edge which is we find that place where we're ripe and ready for the change. In other words, we're not forcing anything which takes us into terror and constriction but we're also not hanging out in our comfort zone. So where's that place that's just enough of a stretch, right? where you're leaning in. It's uncomfortable. It's new. You're figuring things out. There's excitement. There's a sense of adventure. There's curiosity. There's awe. There's wonder. And then noticing when it tips for you either direction that you have the opportunity to start to recalibrate.</p>

是的。好的。我们还有时间问一个问题。所以，我将为Tara W.提问，她问道：“即使是通常乐观的人，现在要保持有意识的抱负也可能充满挑战。最根本的实践是什么才能保持积极的道路？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Okay. We have time for one more question. So, I will ask it for Tara W. who asks, "Staying intentionally ambitious right now can be challenging for even generally optimistic people. What might be the most fundamental practices to stay on a positive path?"</p>
</details>

所以，Rha，这也是您为我们总结的机会。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So, this is an opportunity for you to kind of recap for us too, Ra.</p>
</details>

是的。做那些让你扎根、让你集中、给你带来平静的事情。无论是编织、散步，还是只是望着窗外，凝视水面，或者在海滩边散步。那些给你带来视角感、扎根并集中你的能量、调节你的神经系统、邀请你真正进入一种宁静状态的小而简单的事情，在那里你可以真正倾听并听到自己的智慧和清晰。而这种指导常常来自于能够退后一步并重新集结的能力。重新集结是必不可少的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Do the things that ground you, that center you, that bring you peace. Whether that is knitting or walking or just looking out the window or staring at the water or walking by the beach. Those small simple things that give you a sense of perspective, that ground and center your energy, that regulate your nervous system, that invite you to really get to a place of quietude, where you can really listen and hear your own wisdom and clarity. and the guidance that often comes from the ability to step back and regroup. Regrouping is imperative.</p>
</details>

我怎么强调都不为过，对吗？至少重新集结是必不可少的。所以，我的日常练习是写日记、祈祷、冥想，我的晚间练习是亲近大自然。我沿着水边散步。我看着树。我看着花。我看着太阳。它给了我反思和从日常旋风中解脱的机会。我们越能扎根和集中，我们就越能获得所需的指导，从而在日常生活中做出我们需要做出的选择和决定。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I can't say that enough, right? At least regrouping is imperative. So, my daily practice journaling, prayer, meditation, my evening practice, time in nature. I walk along the water. I look at the trees. I look at the flowers. I look at the sun. Um, and it gives me the opportunity to reflect and decompress from the whirlwind of the day-to-day. The more that we can be grounded and centered, the more that we get the guidance we need to be able to make the choices and decisions we need to make in a day-to-day.</p>

### Rha Goddess的个人口头禅

Rha，最后一个问题，来自我，您现在坚持的口头禅是什么？您为我们的听众提供了这么多，但您自己呢？

<details>

<p class="english-text">Let's stay on you for one last question from me, Rah, which is what is the mantra that's keeping you going right now? You've offered so many to our listeners, but what about you?</p>
</details>

是的，我有很多便利贴。你们看不到，但我的墙上贴满了口头禅和不同的便利贴，我看着它们。其中我最喜欢的一个，特别是因为这对我来说是艰难的一周。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah, I have postits. You all can't see this, but on my wall I have mantras and different postits that I look at. And one of my favorite particularly because this was a tough week for me.</p>
</details>

喜悦永远是我的目的地。所以无论我身处何地，无论我有什么感受，我都允许自己去感受它，但我最终知道喜悦是我的目的地，这就是我前进的方向，这让我能够让经历流过并继续前进。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Joy is always my destination. M so like no matter where I'm at, no matter where I'm feeling and give myself permission to feel it, but I ultimately know that joy is my destination that this is where I'm going and that allows me to let the experience move through and keep on moving.</p>
</details>

美丽。美丽。
