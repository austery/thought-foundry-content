title: 金属超级周期：地缘政治、电气化与资本流动的十年展望
summary: 本期节目深入探讨了当前黄金、白银、铜等金属价格飙升的现象。嘉宾Jeff Currie指出，这并非短期波动，而是由去美元化、去全球化和电气化三大政策驱动的商品超级周期。他解释了新兴市场因地缘政治风险囤积贵金属、中国对白银的战略需求，以及资产轻型科技公司向资产重型实体经济的资本转移。Currie预测，这一周期将持续至少十年，伴随高波动性，并强调了长期投资和供应链重构的重要性。

### 金属价格飙升与超级周期开端

**Joe Weisenthal**: 大家好，欢迎收听新一期OddLots播客。我是**Joe Weisenthal**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Hello and welcome to another episode of the OddLots podcast. I'm Joe Weisenthal.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我是**Tracy Alloway**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: And I'm Tracy Aloway.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Tracy，金属。金属。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Tracy metals. Metals.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 就是这样，这就是本期节目。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: That's it. That's the episode.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 就是标题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: That's it. It's the title.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 不，你说得对。金属领域确实发生了很多事情。现在黄金价格超过每盎司5500美元，创下纪录。白银价格超过每盎司120美元，也是纪录。现在铜价超过每吨14400美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: No, you're right. There is a lot happening in the metals space. So, we have gold above 5,500 an ounce, which is a record. We have silver above $120 an ounce, also a record. And now we have copper at over $14,400 a ton.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的，这对我来说非常有趣，我认为这是一个非常重要的维度。铜是终极工业金属，对吧？“铜博士”告诉我们经济状况，虽然它的声誉可能有点被夸大了，但它确实是终极工业金属。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah. So, this is something that's super interesting to me and I think it's a very important dimension, which is that copper is the ultimate industrial metal, right? And for Dr. Copper tells us about the economy. Probably a little overstated, its reputation, but it's the ultimate industrial metal.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 黄金是终极的没有工业用途的金属，对吧？它主要是一种价值储存手段，一种存在了数千年的货币形式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Gold is the ultimate metal with no industrial uses, right? It's primarily a store of value, a form of money that's existed for thousands of years.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 而白银则介于两者之间。它更像是一种避险资产，但我们也知道它用于太阳能，用于摄影。虽然现在摄影用途已经不多了，但你明白我的意思。所以，有趣的是，为什么它们都在同一时间飙升？是的，我本来也想说同样的事情。历史上，每种金属都会告诉你关于经济状况的非常具体的信息。铜价飙升无疑是在预示人们看好经济增长。白银则介于两者之间。而黄金飙升，传统上你将其与金融系统或更广泛的全球经济中的压力点联系起来，然而现在它们都在同时上涨。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: And then silver is a little bit in the middle. It's more of a safe haven, but we know it has it's used in solar, it's used in photography. Not that that really exists anymore, but you know what I was saying. So, it's like it's interesting to see like why are they all flying at the exact same time? Yeah, I was going to say the exact same thing. So each of these metals historically would tell you something very specific about the state of the economy and copper certainly would be screaming people are bullish on economic growth. Silver, you know, something kind of in the middle and gold, gold soaring is something that you traditionally associate with stress points either in the financial system or the broader global economy and yet here we are. Yeah, it's all happening in once and like you could say, dollar debasement, right? And we know the dollar has been weak against other currencies. It's not like inflation as measured is raging hot. So, it's not just a simple story of the dollar becoming worthless. There's something going on with metals. Maybe they're just the new meme stocks. But we have to dig in.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 是的，我们开始吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yeah, let's do it.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 好的。我必须说，我们今天请到了最完美的嘉宾。我们正在1月29日上午录制这期节目，会尽快发布。但这个头条新闻——铜价飙升10%——真是令人难以置信。我们过去曾多次邀请他，他是一位**超级周期**的信奉者，他的许多预测都得到了证实。他曾在**高盛**工作很长时间。我们将与独一无二的**Jeff Currie**对话，他现在是**凯雷集团**的合伙人，他对大宗商品的了解不亚于我们采访过的任何人。Jeff，非常感谢你再次来到OddLots播客。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: All right. Well, I have to say we really do have the perfect guest on the perfect day. Again, we're recording this the morning of January 29th. We're going to try and get it out ASAP. But this headline, copper surging 10%. Unbelievable headlines. We've had him on multiple times in the past, a believer in super cycles, a vindicated man in many respects with many of his calls. He was a Goldman a long time. We're going to be speaking with the one and only Jeff Curry who is now a partner at Carile knows commodities as well as anyone else we talked to. So Jeff, thank you so much for coming back on the Outlaws podcast.

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 太好了。非常感谢你们邀请我。大宗商品现在又受到青睐了。至少可以说，过去几年是艰难的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: Great. Well, thank you for having me. You know, commodities are up and back in favor. It was a rough last couple of years to say the least.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我们应该问，这会是顶峰吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: What do uh what do we We should just ask is this going to be the peak?

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 是的，这是顶峰吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yeah. Is this the peak? Did we Is uh Yeah, that's the question. Is this the peak? Because

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 它们又回来了。每个人都会问，这是顶峰吗？哦，OddLots是不是抓住了顶峰？因为他们请来了Jeff Currie。所以，我们先把这个问题解决了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: they're back on. Everyone's going to ask is this the peak? Oh, did online get the peak? Cuz they called they ring Jeff Curry. So, let's just get this out of the way.

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 顺便说一句，我喜欢我们现在正处于喜马拉雅山脚下。所以，我们甚至还没有接近真正的山峰。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: By the way, I love that we're in the foothills of the Himalayas right now. So, we're not even close to the the real mountain peaks yet.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 真的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Really?

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: Yes.

</details>

### 金属价格同步上涨的驱动因素

**Tracy Alloway**: 好的。那么，我要问一个显而易见的问题，我们在开场时也提到了，为什么这三样东西会同时朝着同一个方向发展？当你观察整个大宗商品综合体时，任何具有原子序数的周期表中的元素，现在都在上涨。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Okay. So, I'm going to ask the obvious question, which we alluded to in the intro, but why are all three of these things moving in the same direction all at once? When you look at the commodity complex, you take anything that has an atomic number to it that's in the periodic table, it's going up right now.

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 甚至镍和锌也加入了这场派对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: Even nickel and zinc have joined the party.

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 如果它是一个分子，并且含有碳，一个碳氢化合物，一个CH，那么它一直在挣扎。这包括碳氢化合物以及玉米、小麦等碳水化合物。所以，分子领域一直在挣扎，然而那些主要是**关键矿产**的东西，周期表中的原子序数元素，都表现良好。铜的基本面并不比石油紧张多少。金属领域发生的事情是囤积，考虑到对这些关键矿产供应的担忧。你提出了**贬值**（debasement）的想法，我想再补充三个“D”：**去美元化**（de-dollarization）和**多样化**（diversity），与你的贬值一起。所以，贬值、去美元化和多样化是推动所有这些不同金属上涨的原因。当我们考虑去美元化时，这可以追溯到2022年，当时美国和欧洲冻结了**俄罗斯**的央行资产。每个新兴市场都想，“糟糕，我不想持有任何美元计价的资产，因为看看俄罗斯发生了什么。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: If it is a molecule and it has a carbon in it, a carbon hydrogen, a CH in it, it's been struggling. So that includes hydrocarbons as well as carbohydrates like corn, wheat, and so forth. So that space the molecules have been struggling yet you have the things that are primarily critical minerals things that are in the periodic table the atomic number have all done well and the fundamentals in copper are not that much tighter than what you have in oil. that what's going on in the metal space is hoarding given the concerns over having availability of these critical minerals and you you threw out the idea of debasement and I want to throw in three other D's dd dollararization and diversity to your debasement so debasement ddollarization and diversity is what's driving all of these different metals and when we think about the ddollarization and that goes back to 2022 when the US and Europeans froze the central bank assets of Russia. Every emerging market goes, uhoh, I don't want to be owning any dollar denominated assets because look what happened to the Russians.

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 结果是，他们正在尽可能快地从美元资产转向无法被扣押的资产。贵金属和金属就是其中的一部分。当全球地缘政治风险像现在这样高时，无论是美国切断**委内瑞拉**对中国、印度和欧洲的石油供应，还是中国切断对美国及其盟友的关键矿产供应，或者是俄罗斯切断天然气供应，依赖外国大宗商品供应都是一个危险的时期。因此，我们正在进行囤积。每个人都在谈论白银的挤压，使其价格飙升至每盎司120美元。现实是，这是**中国**民众的挤压。他们正在囤积白银，因为担心出口管制等问题。你刚才提到了中国，这正是我们想问你的，如果剔除中国正在发生的事情，黄金等商品的价格涨幅会消失多少？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: And as a result, they're moving as fast as they can out of dollar assets and into assets that cannot be seized. And precious metals and metals are part of that. And then when you have the geopolitical risk as high as they are right now on a global basis, whether it was US cutting off Venezuelan oil supply to China, India and Europe, or it was the Chinese cutting off critical mineral supply to the US and its allies, or it's Russia cutting off supplies of natural gas, it's a dangerous time to be dependent upon foreign commodity supply. And as a result, we have stockpiling. And we everybody talks about the squeeze in silver running it up to $120 an ounce. The reality is this is a squeeze by the population of the people in China. You know, they're hoarding the silver over concerns around, you know, export controls and things of that nature. So you mentioned China just then and this is exactly what we wanted to ask you about which is if you stripped out what's going on in China. How much of the rally would disappear in something like gold?

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 我的意思是，绝大部分涨幅不仅来自中国，还来自新兴市场央行的购买，他们基本上减少了西方债券的持有量，这些债券可能会像俄罗斯那样被冻结。所以，不要低估中国的影响。事实上，如果说有什么影响的话，那就是中国和其他新兴市场已经将黄金市场的其他参与者挤出去了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: I I mean the vast majority of it is not just China but emerging market central bank buying basically reduce their holdings of western bonds that can be frozen similar to what happened with the Russians. So, you know, do not underestimate the impact that China's had. In fact, if anything, China and the other emerging markets have squeezed other participants in the gold market out

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 而且还有很长的路要走。我喜欢指出，在1970年**尼克松**让美国脱离金本位时，央行的黄金储备约为40%。我上次计算，去年年底时约为27%到28%。但过去几天的大幅上涨可能已经达到30%。但我认为关键信息是，央行仍有大量购买空间，以实现美元资产多元化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: and you still have a long ways to go. I like to point out that in 1970 when Nixon took the US off the gold standard, central bank reserves of gold stood at around 40%. Last time I calculated late day in the last year was in that 27 to 28%. But the run up in the last couple of days could be as high as 30 by now. But I think the key message is there's still a lot more buying by central banks who diversify themselves out of dollars.

</details>

### 白银在中国的重要性

**Tracy Alloway**: 我还是有点困惑。为什么白银在中国民众中特别受欢迎？因为我们谈论囤积和一些问题，中国希望持有某些战略资产是完全可以理解的，对吧？它希望积累大量石油，部分原因是为了国防，因为一旦发生战争，无论出于何种原因，他们可能会被切断石油供应。所以他们需要大量石油。那么，在民众层面，白银的什么特质使其如此受欢迎？顺便说一句，我正在看一张图表，这是两天前的，但**上海白银溢价**显示，中国买家支付的价格比世界其他地方高出每盎司5美元以上。但请解释一下，是什么推动了中国民众的这种购买？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: I I'm still a little bit confused. What is it about silver particularly that's so desirable right now from the population in China? Because just let's talk about hoarding and some of these issues. It's totally understandable why China wants to hold certain strategic assets, right? It wants to accumulate a lot of oil in part because of defense purposes because in the event of a war for whatever reason, they may get shot out of oil. So, they need a lot. What is it about silver in the population context that makes it so desirable? And by the way, I'm looking at a chart. This is from two days ago, but the Shanghai silver premium buyers in China paying more than $5 an ounce versus everyone else in the rest of the world. But explain what is it that's driving this purchase from the public in China.

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 好的，首先我们来谈谈它作为**关键矿产**的作用。它用于生产**太阳能光伏**，正如你一开始指出的，这使其50%成为工业金属，另外50%则像黄金一样作为价值储存手段。所以，它具有这些双重用途，它是一种关键矿产，对全球的**电气化**进程至关重要。记住，它是一种**超导体**。实际上，让我回到回答你的问题，Tracy。我们说，黄金、白银和铜有什么共同点？它们都是超导体。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: Okay, first let's talk about its role as a critical mineral. It goes into the production solar PV and that makes it as you pointed out at the beginning 50% an industrial metal and then 50% of a store value like gold. So the fact that it has these dual uses, it's a critical mineral and important to the electrification process on a global basis. Remember, it's a superconductor. Actually, let me go back to answer your question, Tracy. We said, what do gold, silver, and copper all have in common? They're superconductors.

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 我知道人们会说，“Jeff，铜并不是严格意义上的超导体，它不如白银和黄金强，但它在电气化过程中占有一席之地。”所以，当我们考虑白银时，鉴于**太阳能电池板**在中国工业制造过程中的重要性，它对中国的工业基础至关重要。所以，如果你是中国人民银行或其他机构，你会非常关注确保中国内部有充足的白银供应。因此，它还具有像黄金一样的价值储存功能，并且对许多民众来说是可及的，因为即使在今天早上每盎司100美元或120美元的价格，它仍然是一种更实惠的价值储存手段。所以我认为中国和白银如此重要的两个关键点是它作为关键矿产和超导体的作用。鉴于太阳能电池板和其他类型的可再生能源投资对中国工业基础的重要性，拥有安全的白银供应对中国经济绝对至关重要。其次，当我们看白银的价格时，即使每盎司120美元，对于许多民众来说，它仍然是非常实惠的价值储存手段，类似于黄金。而且鉴于最近的价格趋势，人们持有它感到很安心。所以，它具有这两个使其对中国经济至关重要的组成部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: I know people say, "Well, Jeeoff, copper isn't exactly a definition of a superconductor. It's not as strong as silver and gold, but it sits up there in that electrification process." And so when we think about silver, it's critical for the industrial base of China, given the importance of solar panels as a part of the industrial manufacturing process in China. So you know whether if you're the PBOC or something like that, you we're going to be very focused on making sure there's adequate silver supplies inside of China. Um, so the fact that it also then has the store of value like gold and accessible by many parts of the population because even at you know hundred $100 an ounce, $120 an ounce as where we're this morning, it still makes it a much more affordable u you store of value. So I think the two key points for China and why silver is so important is its role as a critical mineral and as a superconductor. And given the importance of solar panels and other types of renewable investments to the Chinese industrial base, having a secure supply of silver is absolutely critical to the Chinese economy. Second of all is when we look at the price of silver, even at $120 an ounce, it is still very affordable to many of the population as a store of value similar to gold. And also given the recent price trends, people feel comfortable in holding it. So it has those two components that make it critical to the Chinese economy.

</details>

### 商品超级周期与资产重估

**Joe Weisenthal**: 有些人可能会说，你可以看到所有这些东西都在飙升，然后讲述一个关于贬值和电气化以及未来世界会是什么样的故事。另一些人可能会说，你可以讲一个更简单的故事，那就是这些市场中有一个是错的，对吧？也许铜看到了经济增长飞速发展，尽管这对我来说似乎不太可能。也许白银介于两者之间。也许黄金对贬值理论是错的，等等。我们怎么知道我们不是在看到投资者犯错？人们只是在追求贵金属的“**迷因币化**”？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Some people would say that like all right, you can look at all these things surging and tell a story about debasement and electrification and what the future world is going to look like. Some other people would say, well, you could tell an even simpler story, which is that one of these markets is wrong, right? So maybe copper sees economic growth going to the moon, although it seems kind of unlikely to me. Maybe silver is somewhere in between. Maybe gold is wrong about the debasement thesis, whatever. How do we know that we're just not seeing investors get this one wrong? People are just going for the meme coinification of precious met of metals. Well, I I do think when we talk about a commodity super cycle,

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 我确实认为当我们谈论**商品超级周期**时，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: the sword, which by the way is nothing other than a commodity capex cycle or a big global capback cycle. And we're seeing that, you know, whe it's an investment in defense, investment into AI, data centers, the list goes on. This is a worldcale capex boom we're now entering.

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 顺便说一句，它不过是一个**商品资本支出周期**或一个大型全球资本支出周期。我们正在看到这一点，无论是国防投资、**AI**投资、**数据中心**投资，不一而足。我们现在正在进入一个世界范围的资本支出繁荣期。这通常是你看到大型商品超级周期的时候，70年代有一个，2000年代有一个。我的意思是，仅仅看**欧洲**的国防开支，未来十年可能达到9万亿欧元。作为对比，2000年代中国的繁荣期是10万亿美元。今天大约是15万亿美元。所以，仅仅欧洲，我们甚至还没有把数据中心和AI考虑进去。因此，当这种情况发生时，我们通常会看到的是**资产重型行业**（old economy）在大宗商品领域的重新定价和重新评级。或者另一种思考方式是，短期来看，奇怪的是，当利率低时，每个人都认为你会进行资本支出周期，不，你是在利率高时进行，因为高利率告诉你，你需要投入资金。所以我们正在进入这些重新定价，转向资产重型行业，这就是为什么它最终将在整个大宗商品综合体中持续下去。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: which by the way is nothing other than a commodity capex cycle or a big global capback cycle. And we're seeing that, you know, whe it's an investment in defense, investment into AI, data centers, the list goes on. This is a worldcale capex boom we're now entering. And that typically is when you see the big commodity super cycles, one in the 70s, one in the 2000s. And we're I mean just take the defense spending in Europe alone. It's likely to be 9 trillion euros over the next decade. To put that in perspective, the Chinese boom in the 2000s was 10 trillion US. Today it's about 15. So even just Europe on alone, we haven't even factored in data centers and AI. So when that occurs typically what we see is a rericing a rerating towards asset heavy industries in commodities or another way to think about it is short duration is strangely is when interest rates are low everybody thinks oh you would be doing capex cycles no you do them when the interest rates are high because the interest rates are high they're telling you you need to put money into the ground and so we're moving into one of these repricing towards assets heavy industries which is why it'll ultimately be sustainable across the entire commodity complex.

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 我想退一步谈谈这些重新定价，因为在我的职业生涯中，我经历了两次。第一次是在2002年到2004年左右，那时我们创造了“**旧经济的复仇**”这个词。旧经济是资产重型的，新经济是资产轻型的。90年代末到2000年代的资产轻型经济主要是关于软件的可扩展性。你不需要投入大量资金就能实现增长。这就是整个资产轻型模式。但最终，我们需要投资的所有这些重型行业都耗尽了。然后中国出现了，很明显我们需要进行这些投资。这发生在那个十年。但那次重新定价和重新评级是一个剧烈的过程，因为它从新经济转向旧经济。下一次我们看到这种情况是在2014-2015年，我们从旧经济转向新经济。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: And I just want to take a step back and talk about these repricings because in my career I've lived through two. The first one was in that call it O2 through like 04 time period and that's when we coined the term revenge of the old economy. Old economy is asset heavy new economy is asset light. And that asset light in the late 90s 2000s was really about the scalability of software. You don't need to have put a lot of money into the ground to be able to create growth. And that was the whole asset light model. But eventually we ran out of all of these heavy industries that you need to make the investments in. And then China came on the scene and became clear we need to make those investments. And that happened over that decade. But that repricing rerating was a violent process as you moved out of new economy or into the old economy. The next time we saw that was in 1415 where we moved out of the old economy and into the new economy.

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 为什么？因为很明显，中国已经走到了尽头。如果你还记得那个时期，欧元从1.4左右跌至平价，历时约18个月。我记得那段时间，油价几乎每天都下跌7美元一桶。每个人都在问，发生了什么？发生了什么？但我想在这里强调一点，回到你的问题，为什么这在所有这些大宗商品中都是可持续的？当我们看2012年一份关于**加拿大石油资产**的私募股权推介书时，他们将该资产估值为每桶110美元。当时该油田的内部收益率（IRR）在110美元时为25%。现在快进到2016年，宏观重新定价之后。油价约为每桶40美元。现在我们重新计算该资产的IRR。你认为会是多少？即时反应是人们会说，“哦，IRR是负的。”不，它大约在18%到19%。它并没有下降多少。为什么？因为加元重新定价，所以工资下降了。资本成本也重新定价了。铜、铁矿石的价格都下降了，所以你的成本基础下降了，使得IRR在那次重新定价中更加稳定。这最终正是我们现在在这个领域开始看到的情况，我相信我们正处于这种重新定价之中，我们将重新回到资产重型领域。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: Why? Because it was clear China was at the end of the track. And if you remember that time period we go through there the euro went from like 1.4 to parody in the course of like 18 months. I remember the period oil was coming down $7 a barrel like every other day. Everybody, what's going on? What's going on? But I want to make a point here to get to your point about why is this sustainable across all these commodities? And when we look at I'm going to take a like a private equity pitch book in 2012 of a Canadian oil asset. They valued the asset at $110 a barrel. The irr of that asset that this oil field was 25% at 110. Now fast forward to 2016 after the macro repricing. Oil was sitting around $40 a barrel. Now let's go repric the irr of that asset. What do you think it is? Immediate response was people go, "Oh, it was negative IRR." No, it was around 181 19%. It didn't come down much. Why is because the Canadian dollar repric so wages went down. You had a repricing of the cost of capital. You had a repricing of copper, iron ore. they all came down and so your cost basis came down such that the irr was far more stable over that repricing and that's ultimately what we're starting to see happen across this space right now and I believe we're in one of these repricings where we're going to move back into the asset heavy space I want to make one last point before moving on this during this it's going to make this one really different from ones in the past

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 我想回到1960年代，因为它与今天相似，那是现代数据中第一次大的商品超级周期。60年代的资产轻型领域是像**可口可乐**这样的公司，事实上，所有“**漂亮50**”都是品牌。品牌与像**微软**这样的公司有什么相似之处？它们可以以零边际成本无限扩展。所以可口可乐当时是全球的宠儿，而所有大型商品生产商、矿业公司、石油公司都处于低谷。然后**阿拉伯石油禁运**成为了重新定价的催化剂。现在不同的是，今天的资产轻型领域正在进入资产重型领域，即这些**超大规模公司**正在投入实体建设。顺便说一句，你不再是一家资产轻型、无限可扩展的软件公司。你是一家矿业公司。你是一家石油公司。你是一个商品生产商。你的估值将会被重新评级。所以，我们看到的是，这次资产轻型领域正在转向资产重型领域，进行实体建设。这将是一个真正的剧烈转变。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: is I want to go back to the 1960s because it's similar to to today and that was at the at least in the modern data the the first big commodity super cycle the asset light space back in the 60s was companies like Coca-Cola in fact all the nifty50 were brands what do brands have similar to let's say Microsoft infinitely scalable at zero marginal cost and so Coca-Cola was the world's darling right now and all of the big commodity producers the miners the oil companies were at the bottom and then you had the Arab oil embargo create that catalyst to repric. Now what happened here is that that's different today. So you think about that asset light space was Coca-Cola then and then in then in in 2000 it was Microsoft and today it's Google and the hyperscalers. Now here's where it gets really different in the power. What's going to happen now is the asset light space is getting into the asset heavy space i.e. These hyperscalers are putting steel into the ground. And by the way, you're no longer a asset light infinitely scalable software company. You're a minor. You're a oil company. You are a commodity producer. Your multiple is going to get rerated. And so what we have is the asset light space this time is moving into the asset heavy space in putting steel in the ground. So this is going to be a real violent transition.

**Jeff Currie**: 所以你问铜、白银以及其他这些东西。它们庞大资本支出预算的限制是什么？是**变压器**的可用性。变压器是什么？大块的铜。所以，这次周期与过去的不同之处在于，资产轻型领域与实体领域在同一时间发生碰撞。这就是为什么我倾向于认为这次重新定价将更加剧烈、更可持续。你将看到的是，这回到了我在2000年代观察到的一个简单观点，当时石油价格首次上涨，因为投资者购买石油，它停留在每桶60美元。那不是超自然的回报。不，实际上在2004-2005年期间，资本从资产轻型领域转向石油领域，以至于成本基础实际上上升了，并没有超自然的回报。所以Tracy，回到你的观点，这有多可持续？我们看到的是所有资本都流入了这个资产重型领域，它将支撑这些价格，并从相对成本基础的角度支持它们。所以，当我们考虑每吨14000美元的铜价时，这并不意味着这些公司正在赚取超自然的回报，因为我们看到如此多的资本流入这个领域。

**Jeff Currie**: So you ask about copper and silver and the rest of these things. What are the restrictions on their big capex budgets? Is the availability of transformers. What are transformers? Big chunks of copper. And so we have a difference in this cycle than ones in the past is the asset light space is colliding in the physical space at the exact same time. Which is what I tend to think that this repricing is going to be more violent, more sustainable. And what you're going to see, and it goes to a simple point that I observed in the 2000s, was when oil first went up because oh, it's a bunch of investors buying oil, it sits at $60 a barrel. That's supernatural returns. No, you actually had capital rotate out of the asset light space and into the oil space during 0405 such that the cost basis actually rose and there was no supernatural return. So go Tracy, back to your point, how sustainable is this? Well, what we're seeing is all the capital flowing into this asset heavy space and it's going to fill the ground underneath these prices and support them from a relative cost basis. And so when we think about $14,000 a ton copper, doesn't mean these guys are earning supernatural returns because we see so much capital moving into the space.

### 超级周期的持续时间与政策驱动因素

**Tracy Alloway**: 我非常喜欢将软件公司与可口可乐进行比较，以及某些商业模式可以以极少的实体需求实现惊人规模扩展的观点。你构建这个观点的方式，我认为非常有助于理解。我们当然在播客中多次谈到超大规模公司进入实体业务，向上游发展，在某些情况下甚至进入电力生产，投资自己的核电站，并雇佣电力交易员。所以这一切都感觉非常真实。就像你说的，我们正处于一个超级周期中。你说我们正处于喜马拉雅山脚下。历史或你的研究表明，这个周期能有多大、能走多远？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: I absolutely love that comparison of the software companies to the Coca-Cas. and this idea that like there are certain business models that can scale incredibly with very little physical needs and I the way you frame that I thought was uh very helpful to understand and we've certainly talked a lot on the podcast about the hyperscalers getting into the real business of things and you know going up the chain and in some cases getting you know getting into the power production investing in their own nuclear plants and hiring power traders. So all of this feels very real. Let's just like you say we're in a super cycle. You say we're at the foothills of the Himalayas. What does history or your work say about how big and how far this can go?

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 嗯，我的意思是，历史上这些周期持续大约**12年**。70年代的周期是这样，2000年代的周期也是这样。70年代的周期从1968年到1980年。2000年代的周期基本上从2002年到2014年。很多人说，“哦，今天的世界与过去任何时候都不同。”但投入实体建设仍然需要大致相同的时间。无论有没有技术。我喜欢指出，这12年是从哪里来的？前三年是让人们相信它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: Well, I mean historically these cycles last somewhere around 12 years. The one in the 70s did. The one in the 2000s did. The one in the '7s from ' 68 to 1980. The one in the 2000s from essentially 2002 to 2014. A lot of people say, "Oh, the world's different today than any of those other points time." Putting steel in the ground still takes about the same amount of time. Technology or no technology. I like to point out where do you get the the 12 years? You the first three years are getting people to believe it

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 在他们真正认真投资之前。我会说这次周期始于2020年。所以，我们在2023年和2025年失去了两年，无论是铜还是石油，部分原因是**俄乌冲突**后价格上涨如此剧烈，以至于全球政策反应异常迅速。我想指出，2022年和2023年的政策反应与其说是利率上升，不如说是**供应的创造**。我之所以这样说，是因为全球范围内的通货膨胀同步下降。而且是在大宗商品需求创纪录和**美国GDP**强劲增长的情况下实现的。这说明了什么？这简单地说明不可能是利率和需求侧的原因。它必然来自供应侧。他们从哪里获得新供应？俄罗斯、伊朗、委内瑞拉。你知道，一些国家面临的问题，他们通过增加劳动力方面的移民来解决。他们通过很多方式在全球范围内创造了供应来应对。现在，这次的重点是，每个人都相信了石油供应过剩，我们没有问题，但那些简单的解决办法下次将不再可用。所以，这次周期将比正常情况持续更长时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: before they they start to really invest earnestly. And I would say this one started in 2020. And so the fact that we lost two years in 23 and 25 whether it was copper or oil and part of the reason for that was the rally in prices was so steep after that Russian Ukrainian invasion that the policy response globally was incredibly swift. I want to point out that policy response in 22 and 23 was not so much the rise in interest rates but the creation of supply. And I say that is because you had inflation come down everywhere in the world in a synchronous manner. And it did it against record commodity demand and really strong GDP growth in the United States. What does that tell you? It simply could not have been interest rates and the demand side. It had to come from a supply side. Where did they get new supply? Russia, Iran, Venezuela. you know, some of the issues that are facing a state, they got it through increased immigration on on the labor side. There was a lot of ways they created supply all over the world to be able to deal with that. Now, the point this time around, and everybody's bought into this oil supply gut, we don't have a problem, is that those easy fixes are not going to be available next time around. So, this one's going to take longer than normal.

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 但我也想解释为什么我对这次是超级周期感到放心，那就是所有这些事情都是**政策驱动**的。70年代的周期是由于**约翰逊总统**的“向贫困宣战”和大规模国防开支。听起来耳熟吗？然后是**阿拉伯石油禁运**。如果你看看2000年代发生了什么，那是决定让**中国**加入**WTO**，一个政策决定。这次的政策决定是**自由贸易战**，而且不仅仅是美国在做，每个人都在做，你知道，限制全球大宗商品供应。事实上，我们在2020年提出的三点，实际上是在这个节目中提出的，它们今天仍然非常有效，而且它们都是政策决定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: But I also want to go why I'm comfortable with this being a super cycle is all of these things are all policydriven. The one in the 70s was due to the LBJ's war on poverty, the big defense spending. Sound familiar? And then you had the Arab oil embargo. If you look at what happened in the 2000s, it was the decision to admit China and the WTO, a policy decision. um here the policy decisions is the war on free trade and it's not just the US doing it everybody's doing it you know curtailing commodity supply around the world in fact the three points we laid out in 2020 in fact it was on this show we laid them out they're still very much valid today and they were all policy decisions.

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 第一点是**去全球化**，即自由贸易战。我的意思是，如果说有什么变化的话，那就是它现在比五年前更加加速了。当我们思考它时，所有这些都是政策决定，而且不仅仅是在美国境内我们看到这种情况，中国正在切断关键矿产供应，欧洲人专注于保护自己，国防开支，不一而足。我们来看当时的第二点，**去碳化**或**电气化**。我知道很多人会说，“哦，美国不是因为最近的政治转变而在这方面退缩了吗？”答案是绝对没有。世界其他地方正在加倍推进电气化，当我们思考世界的电气化时，去碳化并不是当时的动力，现在也不是。再回到过去，我为什么这么说？为什么中国建造了尖端技术和核电、太阳能、风能、电池等等？他们是为了**能源安全**。这有点回到去全球化这一点，他们想要自己的安全能源供应。事实上，**卡特**总统在1977年创造了“能源转型”这个词，并希望从石油转向可再生能源，不是因为他们想拯救世界，而是因为能源安全。关于这一点，最后一点是，**法国**拥有世界上最低的碳足迹。它达到这个目标不是因为它想拯救地球。它达到这个目标是因为它想要核电，所以这是**戴高乐**总统摆脱石油贸易的决定。所以，无论政治上有什么阻力，这个故事都是成立的，而且我认为“绿色”可能从来都不是正确的措辞。你知道，它是可再生的。它是一个安全的来源。核电是一个安全的来源。把数据中心、AI都加进去。它比我们上次谈论时更加加速了。最后，第三点是**再分配**，或者说是**收入不平等之战**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: one was del globalization the war on free trade I mean if anything it's been turbocharged now from 5 years ago and when we think about it it's all policy decisions and it's not just inside the United States where we're seeing this, you know, the Chinese cutting critical mineral supply, you know, Europeans focused on, you know, protecting themselves, defense spending, the list goes on. Let's go to the second one at the time, decarbonization or electrification. And I know a lot of people are going to look at, oh, well, didn't the US backtrack on that with, you know, the recent political shifts? The answer is absolutely not. the rest of the world is doubling down on electrification for both when we think about the electrification of the world where it wasn't decarbonization was not the motivator today it wasn't then and then going back in time why do I say that why did China build cutting edge technologies and nuclear power solar wind batteries and the rest of it they did it for energy security kind of goes into the deglobalization point they want their own secure energy supply in fact Carter coined the term energy transition and wanted to transition out of oil into renewables in 1977 not because they wanted to save the world but because of energy security. One last point on this is France lowest carbon footprint in the world. It didn't get there because it wanted to save the planet. It got there because it wanted nuclear power so it could it was Charles de Gaul decision to rid itself of the oil trade. So this story regardless of what's going on in the political push back and I don't think green was ever probably the right way to phrase this. You know it's renewable. It's a secure source. Nuclear power is a secure source. Throw data centers AI all on top of it. It's turbocharged from the last time we talked about. And then finally the third point was redistribution or the war on income inequality.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的，K型经济。这仍然活跃着。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah K with the K economy. This is alive and kicking.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 等等，再多说说最后一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Wait, say more about that last point.

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 嗯，当我们谈论大宗商品时，实际上Tracy，我看到你甚至也提过我五年前提出的这个观点，那就是：

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: Well, when we think about commodities, and actually Tracy, you I've seen you even make this point that I made back five years ago was that

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 当你看到通货膨胀和大宗商品需求时，它必然来自**低收入群体**。我认为人们对这一点理解是反的，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: when you see inflation and you see commodity demand, it has to be coming from the low income groups. This is a point I think people get backwards, right?

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 通货膨胀对高收入群体不利。原因在于低收入群体。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: Inflation is bad for the high income groups. And the reason why is because the low

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 顺便说一句，你这个预测很棒。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: This was a great call that you made, by the way. Yeah.

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 低收入群体才是真正关心玉米的人。高收入者在任何时候都会消费相同数量的玉米。边际需求必须来自低收入群体。所以，当你给他们钱，比如财政转移支付，以及在某些情况下为了让大众满意，他们会怎么做？他们会花掉。他们会把钱花在大宗商品和实物商品上，这最终会造成通货膨胀。然后高收入者就会受苦，因为政策制定者对高利率的反应是财富下降。另一种思考所有通货膨胀的方式是，它是一种高收入群体和低收入群体之间的财富转移，然后低收入群体会把钱花掉。所以，当我们考虑这里的需求时，就是第三点，即这场**收入不平等之战**。它只会要求越来越多地向低收入群体进行转移支付，以应对社会动荡，而且它现在在全球各地都活跃着。所以，我想，如果你在2020年喜欢这些故事中的任何一个，你今天一定会更喜欢它们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: And the lowincome groups are the ones that actually think about this corn. A highinccome person will consume the same amount of corn at any point in time. The marginal demand has to come from the low income groups. And so when you give them money like fiscal transfers and you know to keep the masses happy in certain situations, what are they going to do? They're going to spend it. They're going to spend it on commodities and physical goods and that ends up creating that inflation. And then the high income people suffer because the visit the response by policy makers to the higher rates is wealth comes down. And another way to think about all inflation is is a wealth transfer between the high income groups and the low income groups and then they go out and spend it. And so when we think about the demand here is that third one which is this war on income inequality. is just going to demand more and more types of transfers to the lower income groups to be able to deal with the civil unrest and and it's alive and kicking everywhere in the world right now. And so I I would assume you know the you know if you liked any of these three stories back in 2020 you got to love them today.

### 供应响应与风险

**Tracy Alloway**: 回到超级周期理论和政策的作用，我们怎么知道这些金属的重要性，它们的战略重要性，不会导致供应增长比我们预期的更快？你知道，部分故事，特别是在铜方面，是现在开采它的人不多了。启动一个新矿需要很长时间。我们怎么知道政府不会只是让获取这些东西变得更容易，从而导致供应响应比你以前看到的更快？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Just going back to the super cycle thesis and the role of policy, how do we know that the importance of a lot of these metals, the strategic importance, how do we know that that won't end up increasing supply faster than we expect? You know, part of the story, especially in copper, is that it's not that many people are pulling it out of the ground anymore. It takes forever to get a new mine started. How do we know that governments aren't just going to make it easier to get this stuff and so you'll see a supply response faster than perhaps you saw previously?

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 让我们回到我的观点。你知道，这些是12年的周期。投入实体建设需要很长时间。即使你摆脱了所有官僚主义和繁文缛节，也需要时间。但我们来看看**关键矿产**。为什么中国主导这些？他们这样做是因为**苏联**和**美国**不想接触下游加工过程，因为“**邻避效应**”（NIMBY）的原因。我的意思是，即使是苏联，让我提醒你，我说苏联是因为这个决定是在70年代做出的。还记得**美国环保署**（EPA）、**超级基金**（Superfund）场地等等吗？美国人和苏联人以前都做过这些。他们停止了，并将其外包给中国人，因为他们不喜欢在自己的后院做这些。这些都是高度有毒的过程。所以，如果你要将它们重新本土化并带回来，你必须找出技术来以一种能够处理那些人们50年前不想处理的邻避问题的方式来做。所以这将非常昂贵，耗时。有办法绕过它，但是，你知道，我听说你可以在美国的军事用地上建造这些设施，这样你就不会遇到任何与环境问题相关的官僚主义。但即便如此，你最后做的这些事情，你知道，如果你在70年代不喜欢它，你今天仍然不会喜欢它。所以，这不是一夜之间就能解决的问题。它需要很长时间。它将需要巨额资本，创造新技术，重新规划全球供应链。这就是为什么我说我们现在只是冰山一角，需要做的事情还有很多，这也是为什么我认为它将持续至少十年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: Let's go back to my point. You know, these are 12 year cycles. It's just putting steel in the ground takes a long time. Even if you got rid of all the bureaucracy and red tape, it's going to take time. But let's go to the critical minerals. Why does China dominate these? They did it because the Soviets and the Americans didn't want to touch the downstream processes because of not in my backyard for nimi reasons. I mean, even the Soviets, let me remind I say the Soviets because this decision was made in the 70s. Remember when the EPA, the super fun sites and all of that, the Americans and the Soviets used to do this. They quit doing it and farmed it out to the Chinese because they didn't like doing it in their backyards. This these are really highly toxic processes. And so if you're going to onshore them and bring them back, you've got to figure out technologies to do this in a way that's going to deal with those nimi problems that people didn't want to deal with 50 years ago. Um so it's going to be very expensive, time consuming. There's ways to get around it, but it, you know, whether I heard, you know, you can build these facilities on army land in the United States, you don't get any of the bureaucracy around environmental problems. But even so, and the last thing you this stuff you do, you you know, if you didn't like it in the 70s, you're still not going to like it today. Um, so I it's not something that can be resolved overnight. It's going to take a long time. It's going to take an enormous amount of capital, new technologies, created, rerouting supply chains around the world. That's why I say that we're at just the tip of the iceberg on what needs to be done here, which is why I think it's going to go on, you know, for at least another decade.

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 我的意思是关于超级周期，70年代和2000年代的周期。它们是**价格飙升的序列**，而不是稳定的上涨趋势。73年有一次，77-78年又一次，80年还有一次。2000年代，04-05年有一次，08年又一次，然后是10年末和11年的最后高潮，当时是**利比亚**事件，然后铜价突破了11000美元。所以每个人都认为它们是价格和资产的稳定上涨趋势。现实是它们是价格飙升的序列，这次将更具**泡沫性质**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: And I mean one last point about the super cycle the 70s and the one in the in the 2000s. They were sequences of price spikes. They weren't a steady upward trend. You had one in 73, another one in 7778 and another one in 80. In the 2000s you had one in ' 0405, another one in ' 08, and then the final finale in 11 late 10 and 11. It was with Libya and then copper topped 11,000. So everybody thinks they're like this steady upward trend in prices and assets. The reality is their sequence of price spikes and this one will be more bubbly in nature.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Right?

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 我喜欢说它是一个**供需失衡的沸腾大锅**。部分原因在于围绕**净零排放2050**的**绿色投资**激增。我喜欢说那笔投资发生在2015年到2021-2022年左右。它创造了一个环境，你有很多可再生风能，比如在德国或西班牙，但你没有电池、电网等等。所以这造成了这些区域性的巨大转变，有时会出现负电价，有时又会出现爆炸性的高价。所以这次的一个特点是，它将在大宗商品领域造成更高的波动性。我认为白银，你会看到它在这些区域性波动中上下起伏。你知道，就像2000年代的**加州电力危机**，那个商品周期，这让我想起了今天白银的表现，你最终会面临一个波动性更高的环境。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: I like to say it's a bubbling cauldron of supply and demand imbalances. And in part of this is because of what happened with the surge in investment around let's call it the green investment around net zero 2050. I like to say that that investment occurred from around 2015 through about 2122. It created an environment where you have lots of let's say renewable wind in places like Germany or Spain, but you don't have the batteries, the grid and the rest of it. So what that creates is these pockets where you can see big shifts where you have negative prices of power at some point, explosive prices on the other side. So the one thing about this time around, it's going to create much higher levels of volatility across the commodity space. I think silver, you can see you're getting through these pockets where it'll go up and down. And you know, whether if it was California Power in the 2000s and that that commodity cycle, which sure reminds me what silver is doing today, is you end up with an environment in which the volatility gets higher.

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 波动性随后吓跑投资者。缺乏投资随后又加剧了更高的波动性。我认为这次这种供需失衡的沸腾大锅中的动态将比过去更加恶劣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: The volatility then scares investors away. The lack of investment then reinforces the higher volatility. And I think that that dynamic in this bubbling cauldron of supply and demand imbalances is just going to be that much more vicious this time around than in the past.

</details>

### 资本流动与市场低配

**Joe Weisenthal**: Jeff，你是我最喜欢的大宗商品谈话对象。但我第二喜欢的大宗商品谈话对象是我在2022年遇到的**优步**司机，他把我送到**彭博社**时，我之前在一期节目中提到过，他说：“哦，我有一个理论。长期看好白银，因为它有很多工业用途，但白银通常是铜生产的副产品，而目前没有大量新的铜生产，因此白银方面不会出现大的供应响应，所以你会看到这种大规模的挤压。”他是我的第二喜欢的人。那是2022年。现在是2026年1月。我的意思是，显然价格是对的，但他描述的这种现象，你觉得准确吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Jeff, you're my favorite person to talk to about commodities. But my second favorite person to talk to about commodities is the Uber driver that I had in 2022 who when he was dropping me off at Bloomberg, and I mentioned this on a previous episode, he's like, "Oh, I have a thesis. some really long silver because it has all these industrial uses, but silver is frequently mined as a byproduct of copper production and there isn't a lot of new copper production happening at this current state and therefore we're not going to see a big supply response be elicited on the silver side and so you're going to get this mega squeeze. So he's my second favorite one. That was 2022. now in January 2026. I mean clearly the price was right but this phenomenon as he described it does that sound uh pretty accurate to you?

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 绝对准确。我的意思是，所有这些，顺便说一句，你可以获得供应。这不是大宗商品的稀缺性，无论是关键金属，甚至是铜。它更像是获取途径。它是政治上获取资源的机会，但更重要的是，是**资本提供资金的意愿**。我喜欢说，这不是关于分子、公吨或蒲式耳的供需。它是关于用于创造生产的**资本的供需**。核心问题就在这里。而资本还没有流入。所以Tracy，回到你的观点，它会持续多久？我们甚至还没有让资本流入。资本仍然停留在新经济或资产轻型世界。而且回报，你知道，顺便说一句，我问过人们，大约在2023、2024年的时候，我说，嘿，你们为什么不想把钱投入这个领域？答案是，Jeff，我同意你的故事。问题是科技领域提供了如此好的回报，如果我低配这个领域，我就会有问题，我宁愿把钱投入摆在我面前的东西。2023、2024、2025年都是这种情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: Absolutely. I mean with all of these it's by the way you you can get the supply. It's not a scarcity of the commodities whether if it's critical, metal, even copper. It's like it's the access. It's it is the political access to where the resources, but more importantly, it's the willingness of capital to provide the money. I like to say it's not about the supply and demand of the molecules or of the metric tons or the bushels. It's about the supply and demand of the capital used to create the production. Therein lies the core problem. And the capital has not moved in. So Tracy, back to your point, how long does it go? We haven't even moved the capital in yet. The capital is still sitting in the new economy or asset light world. And the returns, you know, by the way, I've asked people, I go, like this was in like 23, 24. I go, hey, why don't you want to put money into these these this space? The answer was, Jeff, I agree with your story. The problem is the tech space is providing such very good returns that if I am underweight the space I got a problem and I rather be putting the money into what's out before me. That was the case in 23 24 25.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 澄清一下，自从我们上次和你谈话以来，在“让我们实际开始挖掘”方面并没有太多活动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Just to be clear since the last time we talked to you there has not been a ton of activity in terms of let's actually start digging.

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 不，因为2022年末和2023年初的下跌对整个领域都非常剧烈。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: No, because the pullback in late 22 and early 23 was so vicious across this entire space.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah.

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 那些资金看着它说，我被痛揍了。Curry，你告诉我2020年和2021年进去，工作了一年半，我被彻底烧毁了。我不会再那样做了。所以，他们在那段时间被痛揍了。他们重新进入并相信这个故事的意愿并不高。他们需要看到它。现在它移动得如此之快，就像2022年那样，他们会看着它然后说，“哦，我错过了。”我认为，就像Tracy的观点一样，这会走多远？它有多可持续？我认为关键点在于，波动性正在阻碍他们。是的。这就是为什么我倾向于认为，将资金强制投入这个领域的将是，资产轻型科技或你愿意称之为的任何世界的收益必须达到一个点，他们会看着旧经济说，我愿意承担那个风险并进入，因为那是唯一有回报的地方。当他们这样做时，你就会看到轮换。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: That the money they looked at it go, I got beaten up. You know, Curry, you told me to go in back in 20 and 21, worked for about a year and a half, I got absolutely cremated on the backside. I'm not going to do that again. And so, they got beaten up over that time period. Their willingness to go back in and believe the story is not that high. They're going to have to see it. And now that's moves so quick, so fast like it did in 22 that they're going to look at it and go, "Oh, I've missed it." And I think, you know, it's like Tracy's point is how how much further this go? How sustainable is it? And I think the key point there is it's got it's that volatility is discouraging them. Yeah. And that's why I tend to think what is going to force the money into this space is you're going to have to have the returns in the asset light tech or whatever you want to call it world get to a point that they're go looking at the old economy going I'm willing to take that risk and go in it because that's the only place that has returns. And when they do that that's when you're going to end up seeing the rotation.

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 我还想回到一点，那就是市场对所有这些东西都严重**低配**，因为它被厌恶了太久，所以当资金轮换时，它将是追赶性的。无论是**标普500指数**中能源的2.5%权重，还是营收的7%或8%权重，市值都太小了。无论是金属还是采矿，这些关键的东西都太微不足道了。就像我前几天说的，你把**FCX**和**Ivanhoe Mines**以及其他一些小型铜生产商加起来，它们的总市值是2000亿美元，而**英伟达**是4.5万亿美元。现在突然间，你把那笔钱拿出来，它必须去追逐这个领域。所以你问它能涨多高？它能涨得非常高，因为你谈论的是将数万亿美元从资产轻型领域转移到资产重型领域，而这个领域已经十多年没有人关注了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: And I also want to go back to a point here is the market is so severely underweight all of this stuff cuz it's been so hated for so long that when the money rotates anti- gold bug but when the money rotates it it's going to be playing catchup. Whether if it's, you know, the two and a half percent waiting of energy in the S&P 500 versus what a seven or eight percent waiting on revenues, the market cap is too small and whether if it's in metals and mining critical, these things are just so tiny. It's like we I was talking the other day, you take FCX and let's see Ivanho Mines and some of the other smaller copper producers and what is their market cap is is altogether 200 billion versus Nvidia at 4 a.5 trillion. Now all a sudden you take that money out there and it has to go chase this space. And so you're asking how high can it go? you can go really high because you're talking about moving trillions of dollars out of asset light into asset heavy when nothing's been here for over a decade.

### 超级周期理论的风险

**Joe Weisenthal**: Jeff，非常非常快地问一下，结构性超级周期理论有什么风险吗？你有没有关注什么指标表明它可能不会发生，或者可能不会在你目前预测的时间发生？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Jeeoff, very very quickly, are there any risks to the structural super cycle thesis? Is there any indicator that you're watching to suggest that okay maybe it's not going to happen or maybe it's not going to happen at the moment that you're currently predicting?

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 首先，我想谈谈股票和大宗商品之间的区别。大宗商品是由实际的**物理供需**驱动的，而金融市场中的股票是由**预期**驱动的。预期可能发生，也可能不发生。试图弄清楚下一个人会做什么以及他们会买什么，实际上是可以建模和思考的，但可预测性较低。大宗商品的长期供需平衡，你知道，当你遇到问题时。顺便说一句，人们不会反驳。我的意思是，我想我上次在这里说过，铜就基本面而言是我见过的最好的交易。**Stan Druckenmiller**最近也发表了同样的评论，他说，嘿，它很紧张。是的，它确实很紧张，但它可能今天、明天、后天都不会起作用。我知道如果我持有这个头寸足够长的时间，最终你会达到那个点，它会得到回报，因为，你知道，物理供需，真刀真枪的时候，你就会看到价格上涨。现在的问题是，在那个事件发生之前，你能否保持足够的流动性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: I I first I want to talk about the difference between equities and commodities. Commodities are driven by the real physical supply and demand and equities in financial markets are driven by expectations. Expectations can or cannot happen. I trying to figure out what the next person's going to do and what they're going to buy actually can be modeled and thought through, but it's less predictable. Long-term supply and demand balances of commodities, you know, when you have a problem. By the way, people don't push back. I mean, when I think I said on the last time here, copper is the best trade I've seen in terms of fundamentals. Stan Duck Miller recently, he made the same comment that, hey, it's tight. Yeah, it's really tight, but it may not work today, tomorrow, the next day. I know if I sit on the position and hold it long enough, eventually you'll get to that point where it does pay out because, you know, the physical supply and demand, the rubber meets the road, and you see the the rise in prices. Now the question is can you stay liquid long enough before that event occurs.

</details>

**Jeff Currie**: 所以首先，我之所以对这些故事如此自信，是因为这些市场的前景**极度不平衡**，无论是铜、工业金属、关键矿产还是石油，所有这些都非常不平衡。这就是我自信的理论基础。那么短期风险是什么？并不是说我们要电气化世界，而你没有足够的铜来电气化世界。风险在于，比如中国的住房需求崩溃，但这已经在2023年和2024年发生了。所以，你已经为此付出了代价。所以，当我思考你谈论的这些风险时，它们可能来自需求侧，因为你不能凭空创造供应。所以，必须是需求下降。但需求下降只会最终延迟你遇到问题的时间。铜在2023-2024年期间表现不佳的主要原因是我们低估了中国房地产收缩的严重性。部分原因是西方的高利率迫使中国保持过高的利率，因为他们必须阻止资本外流，结果严重损害了房地产行业。所以，这与金融市场不同，因为预期可能瞬间改变，而且难以预测。归根结底，你需要这种投资。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jeff Currie**: So first of all the reason why I'm so confident into these stories is the forward on these markets are incredibly unbalanced whether if it is in copper you know the industrial metals you know the critical minerals oil all of them are really imbalanced because so that's the thesis why my confidence now what is the near-term risk it's not that you know that you're going to because we're going to electrify the world you don't have enough copper to electrify the world the risk is like the demand for in housing demand in China collapses, but that happened in 23 and 24. So, you've already paid the price on that one. So, when I think about these risks that you're talking about, they might come from the demand side because you cannot create supply from thin air. So, it has to be demand coming down. But that demand coming down just ultimately delays how long it'll take before you run into problems. The main reason why copper didn't perform in that 23 24 time frame is we underestimated the severity of the property contraction in China. And part of that was the high interest rates west forced the Chinese to keep interest rates too high because they had to prevent capital outflow and as a result it really hurt that property sector. So that would be, you know, the it's it's different than the the the financial markets because the expectations can change on a moment and they're hard to forecast. Bottom line, you need this investment.

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: He's so good.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我很高兴我们今天能请到他。我应该提一下，我们是在1月29日录制的。金属价格上涨得如此之快，谁知道明天会怎样。我认为最有力的一点，我的意思是，有很多强大的想法和引人注目的概念。在我看来，其中一个最强烈的想法，我认为在讨论中被低估了，是大宗商品上涨与**自由贸易战**的交集。你知道，我们看到这里的东西变得有点贵，人们看起来像是在想，哦，关税是不是转嫁了等等。但这种更深层次的动态是，如果你没有一个相对开放的贸易世界，那么就会迫使每个人都囤积，迫使每个人都建立自己的版本。然后我在这里建一个芯片厂，在那里建一个芯片厂，因为我们都担心，你会有这种重复，正是自由贸易战，无论是公共还是私人，都推动了所有这些商品密集型支出。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I'm so glad we could get him on today in particular. I should just mention we're recording on January 29th. The price of metals is going up so quickly. Who knows what it's going to be tomorrow. I think the most po I mean there are so many powerful ideas and compelling notions. To my mind one of the strongest ideas that I think is sort of under discussed in the debate is the intersection of the commodity rally and the war on free trade right and you know we look at things they're getting a little bit more expensive here people sort of look like oh is the tariffs being passed through etc. But this deeper dynamic that if you don't have a world of sort of relatively open trade, then that forces everyone to stockpile and that forces everyone to build their own version. And that all I'm going to build a chip plant here and I'm going to build a chip plant there and I'm going to build a chip plant there because we're also worried you have that duplication that it's the war on free trade that whether it's public or private forces all of this commodity intensive spending.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 是的。我只想说，持有金银币是好事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yeah. All I'm going to say is it's good to hold gold and silver coins.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 别再炫耀了。别再炫耀了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Stop rubbing it in. Stop rubbing. Stop rubbing.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 嗯，问题是感觉很好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Well, the problem is it feels good.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 感觉很好。但是，这就是问题。我甚至不知道怎么卖。我得带着一堆金币穿过纽约，找个经销商什么的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: It feels good. But well, that's the thing. I don't even know how to sell. Like I would have to carry a bunch of gold coins through New York and find a dealer or something.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 你知道吗？我们需要再去一趟钻石区，那里有很多窗户上写着“我们收购黄金”之类的牌子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: You know what? We need to take another trip through the uh Diamond District where there are plenty of signs on their windows. We buy gold and so forth.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 嗯，我实际上会做一期关于购买实物黄金的节目。我们来做一期关于出售实物黄金的节目。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Well, I would actually do an episode on buying physical gold. Let's do an episode on selling physical gold. Yeah.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 比如，你到底怎么做？有没有某些方法比其他方法更好，等等？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Like, how do you actually do that? Are there certain ways to do it that are better than others and all of that?

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我完全会做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I totally do that.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我们做吧。听起来会是一期很棒的节目。

**Tracy Alloway**: I like uh I

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我会把它拿进来当镇纸，只是为了惹恼你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I'm going to bring it in and use it as a paper weight just to annoy you.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 嗯，我有我的，我的那个叫什么？不是那个，嗯，我有的那个金属是什么？我的**钨块**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Well, I have my uh I have my uh what's it called? The not the um what's that metal that I have my tungsten cube

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 你曾经痴迷但现在已经忘记的那个金属。我应该问那是不是我的，那是我对硬资产的主要投资，就是我用来当镇纸的那个钨块。我认为是的，我的意思是他说周期表中的每一个元素，他说，如果它是周期表中的一个元素，它的价格都上涨了。我实际上认为钨的价格也上涨了不少，但我并没有大量购买，我想我的钨块大概花了300美元左右。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: that metal that you were obsessed with and now you've forgotten. I should have asked if that's my one that's my main exposure to hard assets is that tungsten cube that I use paper weight I think so I mean he said every element in the he said the the story is that if it's an element in the periodic table it's gone up in price and I actually think tungsten has gone up quite a bit in uh price but I didn't exactly buy in size I think my cube cost about $300 or something like that but

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 好的，那我们就在这里结束吧。
