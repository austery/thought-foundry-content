### 重新定义快感：性教育的缺失与重要性

**Anna Martin**: 大家好，我是 Anna。在节目开始前，我想聊聊情人节，因为《**Modern Love**》已经在考虑这件事了。我们希望大家能帮个忙：我们想知道发生在你身上最浪漫的事，或者你见证过的最浪漫的事。无论是像浪漫喜剧那样在大雨中奔跑的宏大举动，还是像帮你挑走盘子里你不爱吃的橄榄这样的小事，只要让你感受到了浪漫，我们都想听听。请在 2 月 4 日前录制语音备忘录并发送至我们的邮箱。

好了，进入今天的节目。我想请大家做一个快速的思想练习——警告一下，接下来的内容会非常私人。请思考一下你自己的性生活。它是美妙的吗？是匮乏的吗？还是半好半坏？你上一次真正思考什么能让你兴奋、什么能让你的身体感到愉悦、以及你到底想从性中得到什么，是什么时候？

这些都是我今天的嘉宾希望我们自问的问题。她叫 **Nicole McNichols** 博士，是**华盛顿大学**的教授，她在那里开设了一门关于人类性行为的课程。正如你所料，这是校园里最受欢迎的课，总是在排队。现在她出了一本新书，名为《**You Could Be Having Better Sex**》（你可以拥有更好的性生活）。为了写这本书，McNichols 博士研究了多年的数据和无数关于如何获得高质量、充实性生活的调查。今天，她将带我们回到课堂，教我们如何拥有人生中最好的性爱。顺便提一下，这次对话非常直白，如果身边有孩子，请戴上耳机。Nicole McNichols 博士，欢迎来到《Modern Love》。

**Anna Martin**: Hey everyone, it's Anna. All right, before we start the show, I want to talk about Valentine's Day because of course we are already thinking about it over here at **Modern Love**. We're hoping you can help us out. We want to know the most romantic thing that's ever happened to you. Or if it didn't happen to you, the most romantic thing you've ever seen or witnessed. It could be something grand, a romcom style gesture. Maybe someone stood outside your window with a boom box or ran through the airport to stop you from leaving. Or it could be something small like someone knows you hate olives, so they always pick them off your plate before you dig in. Whatever made you feel that rush of romance from the big moments to the tiny ones, we want to hear about it and we want to know why it was so romantic to you. If you have a story in mind, record a voice memo and email it to us at modernlovepodcast@nytimes.com by February 4th and we might use your story on the show.

Now, here's today's episode. I want to do a thought exercise really quick and just a warning, I'm about to get extremely personal extremely quickly. I would like you to think about your own sex life. I'll pause. Think about it. Is it fabulous? Is it lacking? Is it kind of a mix? 50/50. When was the last time you really considered what turns you on? What actually makes your body feel good? And what you really want out of sex? These are all questions my guest today wants us to ask ourselves. Her name is **Dr. Nicole McNichols**. She's a professor at the **University of Washington** where she teaches a class all about human sexuality. As you might guess, this is the most popular class on campus. There's literally always a wait list. And now she has a new book coming out called **"You Could Be Having Better Sex"**. To write this book, Dr. McNichols has poured over years of data, countless studies on what leads to good, fulfilling sex. And today she's here to take us back into the classroom and teach us all how to have the best sex of our lives. And by the way, if it isn't obvious, this conversation is very explicit. So if you got kids nearby, maybe pop on some headphones or save this one till later. Dr. Nicole McNichols, welcome to Modern Love.

</details>

**Nicole McNichols**: 非常感谢，Anna。我很高兴能来到这里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicole McNichols**: Thank you so much, Anna. I'm so excited to be here.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: Nicole，你每年在华盛顿大学向 4,000 多名学生教授这门名为“人类性行为的多样性”的课程。如果我是本科生，我也会冲去报名的。你认为这种长期的排队现象说明了什么？人们好奇什么？他们想发现什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: So, Nicole, you teach the most popular course at the University of Washington to over 4,000 students each year. It's called the diversity of human sexuality. And I have to say, if I was an undergrad, I would be rushing to sign up for this class. What do you think that constant weight list, all those butts in seats, as it were, what does that speak to? What are people curious about? What do they want to find out?

</details>

**Nicole McNichols**: 我认为学生们带着对性的巨大好奇心而来，这很棒，因为**性好奇心**正是驱动我们获得更好、更具连接感的性体验的动力。他们在成长过程中，无论是在社区、老师还是学校里，通常都完全缺乏**性教育**。美国没有联邦强制性的性教育。事实上，许多州要求学校教授的信息甚至是错误的、带有污名化的，并引发了大量的羞耻感。

所以，我在这里是为了让他们放松，感到舒适。因为我认为最大的惊喜往往是——**快感**在我们的生活中是多么重要。我们倾向于认为快感是一种“奖励”。很多学生走进教室时，习惯于认为快感是做完所有作业、打完两份工之后才能享受的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicole McNichols**: I think students are coming in with so much curiosity about sex, which is wonderful because sexual curiosity is exactly what drives us all to be having better sex and more connected sexual experiences. And they have been brought up either within their communities or with their teachers or with the schools that they've been at with usually a complete lack of sex education. I mean, there's no federally mandated sex education. In fact, many schools, many states require schools to teach information. That's just wrong and that's stigmatizing and invoking a lot of shame. So, to be able to tell them, I'm here to make you relax, feel comfortable, because I think that's often the biggest surprise is just how important pleasure is in our lives, right? We tend to think of pleasure as being something that's a treat. And so many students, they come into my classroom, they are used to thinking of pleasure as something that they get to do after all their homework is done, after their two jobs that they're often holding basically.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 是的，就像甜点一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Yeah. Yeah. It's dessert.

</details>

**Nicole McNichols**: 没错，是甜点。我们都在这种非常**清教徒式**的文化中长大，把性当作甜点。甚至我们使用的语言也是如此。所以，首先要从研究的角度出发，大量的研究表明，**积极情绪和快感**对我们的福祉至关重要。不仅关乎福祉，还关乎我们进行创造性思考、解决问题、拓宽视野以及寻求社会支持的能力。所有这些都能帮助我们应对生活中不可避免的挑战和压力。所以，我们的出发点是：第一，快感很重要，性很重要；第二，你以前学到的大部分关于性的知识（如果你学过的话）很可能是错的。让我们重新开始吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicole McNichols**: I mean, we've all grown up in this very puritanical culture that treats sex like dessert. You get lucky. Even if the language that we use. So to be able to first start from the point of view that there is reams of research showing how critical positive emotions and pleasure are to our well-being. And not just to our well-being, but to our ability to think creatively, to problem solve, to broaden our perspectives, and seek out sources of social support. All of which are going to help us cope with the inevitable challenges and stressors in our lives. So just starting from the standpoint of a pleasure is important, sex is important, and b most of what you've been taught about sex, if you've been taught about sex, is likely wrong, right? Like let's start let's start over.

### 性满足：通往幸福关系的“机制”

**Anna Martin**: Nicole，请帮我报名。你把性描述为过上富有创造力、充实生活的核心。但我相信你并不总是这样看待性的，对吧？当你开始教这门课时，你的生活状态是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Nicole, sign me. I'm on the wait list. I mean, you're speaking about sex as central to living a creative, fulfilled life, pleasure as not just a treat that we relegate to a corner. But I have to believe you didn't always see sex this way, right? When you started teaching this course, what was happening in your life at the time that you stepped into teaching this course?

</details>

**Nicole McNichols**: 当时我正处于人生中极度需要性生活帮助的阶段。我是三个年幼孩子的母亲，还有一个丈夫和两只非常粘人的狗。我完全陷入了母亲的角色中——半夜醒来、精疲力竭。虽然从中获得了巨大的满足感，但也感到筋疲力尽。在那时，性开始感觉像是在履行另一个人的生理需求，这让我感到内疚。我知道我想和丈夫建立联系，知道性很重要，但不知道如何解决这个问题。那段时间很难，确实给我们的关系带来了一些压力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicole McNichols**: I was at a time in my life when I desperately needed help with my own sex life. I was a mother of three young children and, you know, a husband and two dogs, very needy dogs. And I was so thrown into motherhood and, you know, the waking up at night and the, you know, exhaustion, joy, I mean, incredible satisfaction and fulfillment from that, but just feeling exhausted and touched out and having sex at that point, it starts to feel like you're just fulfilling another person's physical needs, which is, you know, and just the guilt that came with feeling that way and feeling like I knew that I wanted to be able to connect with my husband and knowing sex was important but not really knowing how to work through that. It was it was hard and it definitely weighed on our relationship a bit at the time.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 而就在这时，你开始教授这门人类性行为课程。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: And this is the moment in your life when you step in to teach this human sexuality course.

</details>

**Nicole McNichols**: 是的。其实我很高兴你提到这一点，因为还有一个关键因素：当我第一次开始教这门课时，我不仅有两个年幼的孩子，还怀着第三胎，已经六个月了。我想系里选择我的部分原因是因为他们觉得，既然我都怀孕三次了，肯定对性有所了解。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicole McNichols**: Yes. Well, actually, Anna, I'm glad you mentioned that because one other critical factor about my condition when I started teaching for the first time this human sexuality course is that I was also I had two young children and I was 6 months pregnant with my third. So, I think I think part of the reason I got selected is because the department figured I probably already knew something about sex given that I was...

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 他们心想：“她至少做过三次。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: They were like, she's at least had it three times.

</details>

**Nicole McNichols**: 没错，看起来够格。当个人生活和职业生涯在这一刻交汇，我开始沉浸在研究中。我惊讶地发现，**性满足**对**关系满意度**是多么重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicole McNichols**: Yeah. So, she seems qualified. Exactly. Wow, what a confluence of personal and professional. I mean to to put it, you know, in a zoomed out way, but all these factors, you know, converging at this point when you step in to teach this course, I assume you're like soaking in the research. What are you discovering? What are you uncovering? Well, I was fascinated and completely blown away at just how important sexual satisfaction is to relationship satisfaction.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 直觉上这似乎说得通，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: I was going to say I feel like intuitively that makes sense, right?

</details>

**Nicole McNichols**: 是的，但看看 **Amy Muse** 博士对数千对伴侣进行的长期追踪数据，你会发现，并不是“拥有幸福的关系就会导致更好的性生活”，方向往往是相反的。通常是**性满足先于关系满意度**。我们可能认为“只要我努力改善关系，性生活就会变好”，改善关系确实至关重要，但数据证明，当性满足感提升时，关系中的快乐和满意度也会随之提升。性是通往关系满意度的一种路径，我认为人们对此重视不够。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicole McNichols**: Yeah. Yeah. But looking at longitudinal data from, you know, Dr. Amy Muse of thousands of couples over time finds that it's not just having a happy relationship is going to lead to necessarily better or more satisfying sex. That the direction of that is the opposite. That it's usually sexual satisfaction that's preceding relationship satisfaction. So we might assume okay well if I just work on my and trust me working on your relationship is critical and we can get into that. But just understanding that if you look at couples over time who are asked to keep daily diaries of how satisfied they feel in their relationships and what their mental well-being is and how happy and satisfied with life they feel overall and how satisfying their sex life is. What you see is that when an uptick in sexual satisfaction occurs, the joy and satisfaction in the relationship follows. So, it's a pathway in that people don't really appreciate enough, I don't think.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 我重复一遍以确保我理解正确。你的意思是，努力改善关系并不一定会带来更好的性生活。但数据证明，拥有更好、更充实的性生活是通向更高关系满意度的一种方式。性就像是一个“载体”——或者说，更好的词是“机制”？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: And I'm just I'm going to say it back mostly because I want to make sure I understand it. It's like, okay, yeah, good sex, good relationship, whatever. What you're saying is working on your relationship, that's not necessarily going to lead you to have better sex. What the data does prove is that having better, more fulfilling sex is a way to lead towards more relationship satisfaction. It's like the sex is the vehicle. The maybe that's the wrong word, but is that right?

</details>

**Nicole McNichols**: **机制**。我们喜欢这个词。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicole McNichols**: The mechanism. We love the word mechanism. Vehicle sounds better.

</details>

### 理想频率与“性爱蓝图”

**Anna Martin**: 既然你已经教了 15 年这门课，你是否将所学应用到了自己的性生活中？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Okay. Sex is the mechanism for relationship satisfaction. Now, that is really that is really interesting. I mean, you're you're learning this stuff. You're immersed in this as you're teaching this course. How many years has it been now that you're teaching this? 15. Over the course of that, have you implemented the things you've learned in your course to your own sex life, your intimate life with your husband?

</details>

**Nicole McNichols**: 绝对应用了。另一件给我希望的事是关于“频率”的。作为一个数据迷，我经常被问到一个私密问题：“那个**魔力频率**是多少？”换句话说，为了获得关系满意度，我们到底需要多频繁地进行性生活？

答案是——这是一个平均值——**每周一次**。这并不是一个天文数字，对吧？对于那些喜欢设定目标的人来说，知道目标是每周一次是很令人欣慰的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicole McNichols**: Absolutely. The other thing that really gave me sort of a sense of hope, right? Because you can think sex is super important, but oh my god, like how am I supposed to be carving out having sex all the time with my husband when I am so busy with all of my kids and my teaching load? And I was also really heartened to see, and you know, I'm a data nerd, so forgive this. But you know, one of the hush-hush questions I often get from other couples that I have had too was, "Okay, but like what's that magic frequency?" Right? In other words, we know sex is important, but like how often do you really need to be having it to see these benefits that we know it leads to with relationship satisfaction? And the answer, Anna, and this is a mean, an average. Once a week, which is not an astronomical amount of time, right? No, it is not. And it's not that, you know, couples who have sex more than once a week, that's fantastic if they want to do that. But when we look at the benefit of sex to relationship well-being, it doesn't increase after about once a week.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 我很喜欢这个说法，因为对很多伴侣来说，每周一次是可执行、可实现的，而且不会让人感到压力。那么，对于想要改善性生活的人，你会建议从哪里开始？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: I really like this because for many couples, I feel like hearing that number, one time a week, having sex one time a week is implementable and quite doable and not intimidating. Okay. So, a lot of us have questions about our sex lives, but not all of us can take your course, unfortunately. So for someone who wants to have better sex, where would you tell them to start?

</details>

**Nicole McNichols**: 我可以给你一个宏观的答案和一个具体的答案。宏观的答案是，遗憾的是我不能给你打一针 GLP-1 来改善性生活，但我可以给你一份**蓝图**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicole McNichols**: Well, I can give you the 10,000 foot answer and the specific answer to this. The 10,000 foot answer is that unfortunately I cannot offer you a GLP one shot to improve your sex life. But I can give you a blueprint.

</details>

### 重新审视随机性行为：动机与同意

**Anna Martin**: 让我们聊聊不同的场景。比如有人是单身，正在约会，会有**随机性行为**（Casual Sex），但体验总是不太好。你会问他们什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: I want to throw out some different scenarios that people could be experiencing. Let's say someone is single, they're dating, they're having casual sex, and they keep finding themselves having experiences that are just not great. Applying these sort of ways to have better sex to this situation. What would be your first question for them?

</details>

**Nicole McNichols**: 对于随机性行为，我的看法与媒体宣传的负面信息非常不同。媒体总是说它很可怕，尤其是对女性，会导致孤立和绝望。现实中确实可能如此，但随机性行为也可以很棒、很刺激、充满快感。有一项研究甚至显示，在合适的情况下，随机性行为可以提高 **GPA**（平均绩点）。

当你在全国代表性数据中调查人们上一次性体验时，结果通常分为三类：三分之一的人觉得不满意、感到空虚；三分之一的人觉得非常棒、是一场冒险；还有三分之一的人觉得两者兼有。有趣的是，男女之间的差异并没有你想象的那么大。很多女性也拥有美妙的随机性行为。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicole McNichols**: I will say that when it comes to casual sex specifically, I have a very different view than a lot of the messaging that we've seen about sort of the the types of impact that casual sex has on people and relationships, which has mostly been negative. Right? Most of what we see in the media is fearful messaging. It's terrible for women. It leads to a sense of isolation and despair. And the reality is that it absolutely can lead to those feelings. But casual sex can also be awesome. It can be exciting. It can be pleasurable. It can be a form of sexual adventure. There's a study I love that even shows that in the right context, casual sex can lead to an increased GPA. This is real data. When you really poll people about okay what was your last sexual experience truly like, it's very mixed. You see about a third of people who are like it was really unsatisfying and it left me feeling empty. But then we get another third who say it was awesome. It was pleasurable. It was an adventure. And then you get about another third that are like, eh, it was a little bit of both. And there is a small gender difference, but not nearly as big as you might think. In other words, there are a lot of women having a lot of fabulous casual sex.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 那么数据还显示了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: And what does the data show?

</details>

**Nicole McNichols**: 关键在于**动机**。你在这场体验中寻找什么？如果你追求的是冒险、玩乐、实验或压力释放，甚至是**性自我肯定**（即通过此举获得自信），这些被称为“**自主驱动动机**”的原因往往能带来极好的体验。相反，如果你是因为想要更深层的联系却不敢开口，结果往往很糟。

此外，我还要提到我的《**同意宣言**》（Consent Manifesto）。目前文化中对“同意”的定义非常局限，仅限于身体边界。我们需要引入对彼此**社交和情感边界**的尊重。这意味着要保持情感诚实，比如问：“如果这只是为了好玩，你可以接受吗？”或者“你现在感觉如何？”当两人的目的不一致时，体验就会变差。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicole McNichols**: It really comes down to motivation. In other words, what are you looking for in the experience? And are you looking for adventure and play and fun and experimentation and letting off stress or even sexual validation? When your motivation is those what we call autonomously driven reasons, it can be really exciting and hot and fun. On the contrary to that, when there is a sense that you're having it because you actually want something deeper, but you're not quite sure how to ask for that, it can lead to really poor results.

And this is where I think it's relevant to mention my consent manifesto. We have a very limited definition of consent right now in our culture which is mostly limited to our physical boundaries. We need to start bringing in not just respect for each other's physical boundaries but respect for each other's social and emotional boundaries as well. We need to have a sense of emotional honesty. We need to be normalizing things like saying, "Are you okay if this is just for fun?" Because when those two purposes are misaligned, that's what leads to a negative experience.

</details>

### 长期关系中的火花：微创新与计划性性爱

**Anna Martin**: 那么在长期关系中，如果火花已经熄灭，你会建议如何重燃？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Okay, so casual sex is one context. Another context is a long-term relationship. If someone's listening and they are in a long-term relationship where the sexual spark has faded, what would you recommend they do to reignite that spark?

</details>

**Nicole McNichols**: 我们可以从研究中总结出五个主要变量：
1. **营造氛围**：不要指望从处理工作邮件直接跳到床上就能拥有完美的性爱。调暗灯光、点上蜡烛。
2. **表达爱意**：研究发现，在性爱中说“我爱你”的伴侣满意度更高。还有**亲吻**，亲吻能增加高潮的机会，尤其是对女性，因为它能放慢节奏并增加情感亲密度。
3. **优先考虑高潮**：但要灵活看待。并不是每次都必须高潮才算完美。扩大对“性”的定义，它不只是插入，还包括各种活动。
4. **沟通**：使用一些简单的短语，比如“**引导我**”（Guide me）或“**做给我看**”（Show me）。
5. **尝试新花样**：也就是**新奇感**（Novelty）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicole McNichols**: There's sort of five major variables. The first one is set the mood. Don't just expect yourself to go from all those work emails to jumping into bed and having amazing sex. Lighting candles, lowering the lights. But couples who say I love you during sex are actually... I know. And kissing. Kissing during sex increases the chances of orgasm particularly for women. Researchers think it's because if you're kissing, it's likely slowing the pace of sex and increasing emotional intimacy. Second, prioritize orgasm, but with nuance. It's not the case that you have to have an orgasm in order to have an amazing sexual experience. There needs to be widening our definition of what sex is. It's not just penetration. Third, communicate. Using these phrases. "Guide me" is my favorite one. "Show me." Fourth, switch things up. Novelty.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 我们需要每次都尝试完全不同的东西吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Do I need to be doing something totally different every time we have sex?

</details>

**Nicole McNichols**: 不，数据表明，每月尝试一次新事物的伴侣就能达到满意的阈值。我喜欢称之为“**微创新**”（Micro-novelty）。它不需要你去成人用品店买一堆皮革装备，可以只是微小的改变。比如“**抬高式传教士**”——在女性臀部下垫个枕头，或者改变姿势的角度。也可以是换个房间、换个时间，或者在度假时进行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicole McNichols**: No. Data shows that couples who try to do something new once a month or more tends to be that threshold. I love to discuss this idea of micro novelty. It does not need to mean that you're going to a sex shop and buying a bunch of leather. It can be as subtle as instead of missionary, lifted missionary. You can either put a pillow underneath the woman's hips or her legs around her partner's neck, which is going to elevate the pelvis into an angle that is going to be more pleasurable. Or having sex in a different room, at a different time of day.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 你还提到了“**计划性性爱**”（Planned Sex）。这听起来和“新奇感”似乎是矛盾的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: You spoke about this idea in long-term relationships of how beneficial it can be to planned sex. Talk to me about how those two things can coexist because they seem potentially contradictory.

</details>

**Nicole McNichols**: 其实并不矛盾。数据证明，计划性性爱和自发性性爱一样令人愉悦。计划性性爱需要一个“**品牌重塑**”——它不是待办清单上的枯燥任务，而是一个预留的**情色空间**。它让你有时间去期待、去幻想、去给伴侣发调情短信。如果到了预定时间你实在没心情，**重新预约**（Rescheduling）也是正常的，只要别一拖就是两个月。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicole McNichols**: When we ask people which do you think is hotter, planned sex or spontaneous sex, everyone says spontaneous. But when you ask them to keep daily diaries, guess what? It's just as pleasurable when it's planned. It's the perfect pathway into introducing micro novelty because you have time to think about what might be fun to try, to anticipate, to fantasize. It just needs a rebrand. It's a regular erotic space where you can explore and be explored. And if the planned sex time comes and you're just not into it, normalize rescheduling. Put another date on the calendar. I have a 48-hour rule.

</details>

### 结语：掌控你的快感

**Anna Martin**: 如果有人想从今晚就开始行动，有没有什么座右铭或口号可以记在心里？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: I wonder if you have a sort of mantra or rallying cry that we could keep in mind if someone listening does want to start tonight. What's a mantra we can hold on to?

</details>

**Nicole McNichols**: **掌控你的快感**（Own your pleasure）。这意味着了解什么能让你进入性状态，感到有力量去表达自己的需求，并进行沟通。承担起这份责任，知道你有力量去实现它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicole McNichols**: Own your pleasure. It really is about owning your own particular brand of what makes you come to a sexual situation, feeling empowered to show up, assert your own needs, communicate, and have a mutually pleasurable experience. And it's really about taking ownership, right? Taking that responsibility into your own hands and knowing that you have the power to do it.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 我就知道你会有这么一个座右铭。Nicole McNichols 博士，非常感谢这次对话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: I knew you'd have a mantra right there at the front, Dr. Nicole McNichols. Thank you so much for this conversation. I really appreciate it.

</details>

**Nicole McNichols**: Anna，这真是一次愉快的谈话。谢谢邀请。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicole McNichols**: Anna, this was such a delight. Thank you so much for having me.

</details>
