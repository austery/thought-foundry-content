### 贸易战的幻想与现实

主持人 Jill: 大家好，欢迎收听《OddLots播客》的又一期节目。我是Jill Wisenthal。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to another episode of the OddLocks podcast. I'm Jill Wisenthal</p>
</details>

主持人 Tracy: 我是Tracy Alloway。Tracy，我不敢肯定，但我总觉得美国人或政府可能存在一种幻想，认为在这场贸易战中，非中国亚洲国家可以成为我们的合作伙伴，成为我们重要的贸易伙伴，而中国可以某种程度上被孤立。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I'm Tracy Aloway. Tracy, I don't know this for sure, but I kind of have this feeling that there's a bit of a fantasy perhaps on the part of Americans or the administration or so forth that in this trade war that non-China Asian countries, they could be our partner. They could be our big trading partner and that somehow China could be isolated from them.</p>
</details>

主持人 Jill: 也许吧。我的意思是，我知道很多人担心中国商品会大量涌入越南等地。所以我觉得情况比那要复杂一些。你知道，我觉得有一件事很有趣，虽然我对“有趣”的定义可能与很多人不同，但如果你看看实际汇率，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Maybe. I mean, I know there's a lot of concern about Chinese goods basically flowing over the border into places like Vietnam. So I think it's a little bit more nuanced than that. You know, one thing I find really funny and my definition of fun might differ to a lot of other people's, but you know, if you look at the real exchange rate,</p>
</details>

主持人 Tracy: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

主持人 Jill: 也就是根据通货膨胀等因素调整后的货币汇率，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so currency adjusted for inflation and stuff like that,</p>
</details>

主持人 Tracy: 自一月以来，美元的实际有效汇率上涨了约20%，而人民币（UN）的实际有效汇率则下跌了14%。所以，如果你想让自己的商品，即美国商品，具有竞争力，感觉我们正朝着相反的方向发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the real effective exchange rate for the dollar is up like 20% since January. And the real effective rate for the UN, the Chinese UN, is down 14%. So if you're trying to like make your own goods competitive, American goods competitive, it feels like we're heading in the opposite direction.</p>
</details>

主持人 Jill: 等等，这难道不是真的吗？即使美元兑所有这些货币的名义汇率大幅下跌，但在实际基础上，根据美国银行的数据，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wait, isn't that really true that even with the nominal the massive nominal decline in the US dollar against all these currencies that on a real basis to Bank of America,</p>
</details>

主持人 Tracy: 嗯，这太疯狂了。我肯定没想到会这样。而且这又回到了一个问题，就是关于关税和贸易战，我仍然不知道目标是什么，而且它变化很大。我不知道其中有多少是成功的，但在拜登政府时期，我曾觉得，好吧，我们在贸易政策和其他技术转让政策上有一个具体目标，那就是在某些关键领域达到或接近或领先于前沿。而在这个政府的贸易政策下，我觉得它完全是杂乱无章的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">huh, that's pretty crazy. I would not have I certainly would not have guessed that. And also this sort of gets back to the point that like with the tariffs and with the trade war, I still don't know what the goal is. And it changes a lot. I don't know the degree to which any of it was successful, but under the Biden administration, I had some sense of okay, we had the specific goal with trade policy and other tech transfer policies to be at or near or ahead of the frontier of cutting edge in a certain key areas. And when it comes to trade policy under this administration, it strikes me as all over the map.</p>
</details>

主持人 Jill: 是的。所以很明显，存在一个问题，即美国是否需要在国内生产玩具等物品，以及人们是否愿意从事这些制造业工作。最后，正如你所指出的，目标非常混乱，因为一方面，这似乎是为了将制造业带回美国，但另一方面，特朗普政府又表示，这是一种增加收入的方式。是的，也是。然后特朗普又说：“我要达成所有这些协议。”所以协议也被他视为胜利。但如果他需要增加收入，他真的会达成协议吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So there's the question obviously of whether the US needs to be manufacturing things like toys in America, whether people would be interested in taking those manufacturing jobs. And then finally, as you pointed out, the goals are so confusing because on the one hand, it seems like, all right, it's about bringing manufacturing back to the states, but on the other hand, the Trump administration has said that it's a way of raising revenue. Yeah. as well. And then you have Trump saying, "I'm gonna strike all these deals." So deals are seen as a win for him as well. But then if he needs to raise revenue, is he actually going to strike deals?</p>
</details>

主持人 Tracy: 完全正确。嗯，总之，有无数个问题，我们可能在有生之年还会围绕这个话题进行数百集节目。但我认为现在是时候从中国商界、中国制造业等角度，以及中国政策等方面，来了解一下中国对这些激进行动的看法和回应了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Totally. Well, anyway, there's a million questions and we will have hundreds of more episodes in our lifetime probably that revolve around this topic. But I think it's a good time to get some perspective from the perspective of the Chinese business community, Chinese manufacturing and so forth, Chinese policy, etc. and like how a lot of this is being perceived from the Chinese perspective and the response to the aggressive actions.</p>
</details>

主持人 Jill: 是的。因为美国的政策并非发生在真空中，对吧？中国正在对此做出反应，你知道，有时中国行动非常迅速，所以我们应该谈谈这个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Because US policy isn't happening in a vacuum, right? Like China is reacting to it and you know sometimes China can move pretty fast so we should talk about it.</p>
</details>

主持人 Tracy: 完全正确。嗯，我非常高兴地说，我想我们确实请到了一位完美的嘉宾。我们将与Cameron Johnson对话。他是Title Wave Solutions的高级合伙人。他常驻上海，但目前暂时在美国拜访我们。他是一位对中国商业和制造业脉搏了如指掌的人。Cameron，非常感谢你来到《OddLots播客》。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Totally. Well, I'm very excited to say I think we do have the perfect guest. We are going to be speaking with Cameron Johnson. He is a senior partner at Title Wave Solutions. He's based in Shanghai, but he's temporarily here in the US visiting us. Someone who has his finger on the pulse of Chinese business and manufacturing. Cameron, thank you so much for coming on Loblot. Thanks for</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 谢谢邀请，伙计们。很高兴能和你们一起在纽约。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">having me, guys. It's great to be here in New York with you.</p>
</details>

主持人 Jill: Title Wave Solutions是做什么的？你们具体业务是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's Title Wave Solutions? What do you do?</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 我们是一家专注于供应链、制造业咨询的精品公司。想象一下，如果你是一家需要供应链地图和风险评估的企业，也许你需要提高运营效率，也许你需要了解全球各国政府未来五年的政策路线图。这些就是我们关注的一些方面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it's a boutique firm focused on supply chain, manufacturing, advising, consulting. Think if you're a business that needs a supply chain map and a risk assessment, maybe you need some operational efficiencies, maybe you need to understand the policy roadmap for the next 5 years that the various governments around the world are doing. Those are some of the things that we focus on</p>
</details>

主持人 Tracy: 鉴于最近的事件，你们的业务有多繁忙？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">given recent events. How busy have you actually been?</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 你知道，有趣的是，四月份业务相当缓慢，因为我们最初以为第一季度会很正常，还不错。四月份开始时也像一个正常年份，但当关税出台后，一切都停滞了。所以基本上在中国，有几个星期供应链几乎没有任何流动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, interestingly enough, in April, business was quite slow because it it started off that we thought it was going to be kind of a normal Q1 was okay. April was kind of starting off to be a normal year, but then when the tariffs came in, everything stopped. And so essentially in China, what you had is you had a couple weeks where almost nothing moved in the supply chains.</p>
</details>

主持人 Jill: 沃尔玛（Walmart）最终站出来说：

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh Walmart came out</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: “让我们把一些东西动起来。”这有点疏通了局面。但四月份确实很艰难。然后日内瓦会议之后，就像水龙头开闸一样，所有人都开始思考：我们如何

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">eventually and said, "Let's get some stuff moving." And that kind of unclogged things. But April was really tough. And then after Geneva is kind of the fire hose came on and everything and everybody was how do we</p>
</details>

### 关税影响下的供应链调整

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 转移产品？如何转移生产？如何将人才转移到我们需要的不同区域？所以从那时起，业务一直非常繁忙。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">move products around? How do we move production around? How do we get talent in different areas that we need to get it into? So it's actually been quite a rampage since then.</p>
</details>

主持人 Tracy: 我们在7月16日录制这期节目，我不得不承认，我不知道目前对中国的关税税率是多少。我不知道最新的截止日期是什么。我像市场上的许多人一样，已经有点跟不上这些信息了。很多事情突然变成了噪音。但我想问，截至7月16日，根据目前已宣布的关税或其他各项措施，中国的商业状况与4月2日之前相比，是否有显著不同？或者你会说，大部分情况仍然差不多，只是在适应不同的关税税率？商品流动或供应链是否有重大变化？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we're recording this on July 16th and I have to admit I don't know what the tariff rate is on China these days. I don't know where things stand in terms of what the latest deadline is. I've sort of lost track of it all like many people in the market. A lot of this has suddenly become noise. But I can ask on July 16th from what's been announced so far, whether it's tariffs or various other actions, is the state of business in China meaningfully different than it was prior to April 2nd or would you say mostly things are kind of the same and adjusting to uh different tariff rates? Have there been some major shift in flows or supply chain?</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 不，没有。不过你确实看到很多零部件在四处移动。你知道，玩具、家具这类东西，如果以前在中国制造，现在肯定不是了。但这不一定意味着你要撤出工厂。我们看到的一个现象是，现在很多公司都在进行**技能升级**（Upskilling: 提升员工技能以适应更高价值工作），对吧？他们会把利润更高、水平更高的产品放在中国生产，而把低端产品放在中国以外的地方。想想越南和中国。中国可以生产你想要的任何**SKU**（Stock Keeping Unit: 库存单位），基本上是按需生产。越南则不能生产那么多。所以当你实际查看贸易流量时，越南生产的SKU种类要少得多，并将其运往美国。中国则将其运往世界其他地区。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, there hasn't been. What you do see though is a lot of moving around of pieces and parts. you know, toys, furniture, these kinds of things. If they were made in China before, they're definitely not now. But that doesn't necessarily mean you're pulling your factories out. One of the things we have seen is that a lot of companies now are upskilling, right? They they're going to put the higher margin and higher level products in China. They'll put the lower products outside of China. Think of Vietnam versus China. China can make any SKU you want known demand essentially. Vietnam can't make that many. So when you actually look at the trade flows, Vietnam produces far fewer SKUs and ships them to the states. China ships it to the rest of the world.</p>
</details>

主持人 Jill: 等等，再多谈谈将低质量生产转移到其他地区的问题，因为很多人想到中国时，仍然会想到基本商品的制造，对吧？而实际上，我认为自那时以来，它已经取得了很大的进步。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wait, talk more about shifting I guess lower quality production into other areas because again a lot of people when they think of China will still think of basic goods manufacturing, right? When in fact I think it's progressed quite a lot since then.</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 确实如此。而且通常，你知道，如果你回顾过去十年，简短的历史是，当第一次贸易战爆发时，很多公司都想做“中国+1”或“中国+2”的模式，对吧？你有一个主要的制造商在中国，然后你可能在东南亚、拉丁美洲等地有一个姊妹工厂。现在发生的情况是，这些中国以外的工厂也在进行技能升级，但它们也变得更加专业化。在中国，你仍然可以进行技能升级，因为当地的生态系统为你提供了世界上其他任何地方都无法比拟的优势，特别是对于某些产品。你会保留这些优势，并承担关税带来的利润损失。但在其他地方，它为你提供了更大的灵活性。所以现在，例如你在越南，当然你可能要面对美国20%的关税，但与中国相比，你仍然能获得利润，并且会没问题。现实情况是，当你实际查看关税总表时，它一团糟。没有人知道发生了什么。事实上，我们现在听到一些公司实际上正在将制造业**回流**（Reshoring: 将生产迁回本国）到中国，因为当你实际查看关税的运作方式时，20%的关税，然后转运时据说有40%的关税，在20%的关税下，某些商品即使承担关税，在中国制造也更具竞争力。基本上，情况会是这样：

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It has. And often, you know, when you look at kind of the last 10 years to a short history when when the first trade war came out, a lot of companies wanted to do China plus one plus two, right? You have a primary manufacturer in China, then you have, you know, a sister factory maybe in Southeast Asia, Latin America, that kind of thing. What has happened now is that those factories now outside of China are also being upskilled, but they're also being more specialized. In China, you can still upskill because of the local ecosystems that offer you far more advantage than anywhere else in the world, particularly for certain products. you'll still keep that and eat the margin within the tariffs. But in other places, it gives you more flexibility. So now if you're in Vietnam, for example, sure you might have a 20% tariff from the states, but when you compare with China, you're still getting that that margin and you'll be okay. The reality is when you actually look at what's happening overall in the tariff schedules, it's a mess. Nobody knows what's going on. And in fact, we're hearing now that some companies actually are reshoring manufacturing back to China because when you actually look at how the tariffs are working 20% than supposedly 40% on the trans shipment at 20% certain goods are more competitive to maybe made in China even with eating the tariffs. And essentially it would go something like</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 乔，你正在生产一种特定类型的杯子。也许是一个圣诞主题的杯子，对吧？所以你需要更专业的机器、人员和人才。好吧，从中国进口是50%的关税，从越南进口是20%。在越南可能很难获得，因为他们不够专业。所以，乔，作为制造商，你会去找给你纸板和塑料的包装供应商。你会去找你的原材料供应商，你会去找这个，去找那个，你会要求他们都从给你的销售额中扣除两三个百分点。突然之间，那55%或50%的关税自动变成了20%。这就是公司在微观层面开始应对这些挑战的方式。如果我现在想设计一个圣诞杯，我能多快获得一个制成品，然后却无法发货？不，我是认真的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Joe, you're making a certain type of cup. Maybe it's a Christmas branded cup, right? So you need a little bit more specialized machinery, people, talent. Okay, it's 50% from China, 20% from Vietnam. It's difficult maybe to get in Vietnam because they're not as specialized. So here's Joe. You as the manufacturer, you're going to go to the packaging supplier who gives you your cardboard and plastic. You're going to go to your raw material supplier, you're going to go to this to that, and you're all going to ask them to take two or three points off their sales to you. And all of a sudden, that 55% or 50% automatically becomes 20%. So that's how companies in the granular are starting to work around some of these challenges. If I did have a Christmas cup that I wanted to design right now, how quickly could I have a manufactured product that then couldn't ship? No, I'm serious.</p>
</details>

主持人 Jill: 你知道中国有一个专门生产圣诞商品的“圣诞小镇”吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you know there's a whole like Christmas town in China that specializes in Christmas good?</p>
</details>

主持人 Tracy: 听起来很熟悉。我能在今年圣诞季之前拿到一个杯子吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sounds familiar. Could I have a cup by this Christmas season?</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 你可以按需获得任何设计、任何材料的任何杯子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You could have any cup of any design of any material on demand.</p>
</details>

主持人 Tracy: 多快？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">How quickly?</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 嗯，这取决于设计。取决于你需要多少个生产环节。如果你已经有了设计，有了**CAD**（Computer-Aided Design: 计算机辅助设计）等所有东西，你可能需要两个月，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it depends on the design. It depends how many parts of the process you need. If you already have the design, you have the CAD and everything, you're looking at probably two months,</p>
</details>

主持人 Jill: 也许更短。例如，如果是大规模生产，你想把全国所有的星巴克都塞满，那当然会更长。但如果你只是寻找专业化的生产，也许你是一家公司，对吧？你想为员工提供圣诞礼品，可能几百个，几千个，那你可以很快完成。这实际上在之前与Sarah Laflur的一期节目中也提到过，当时我们谈论的是服装，但我认为它更广泛适用，她强调了中国在这方面的专业知识以及其建立的供应链网络的重要性。所以，如果你是外国投资者或美国公司或其他什么，你去中国，人们立刻就知道该怎么做，如果你要求建工厂的话。所以我很好奇，像越南这样的地方，能在合理的时间内复制这种模式吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">maybe less. If it's at scale, for example, you want to shove every Starbucks in the country, then of course it would be much longer. But if you're looking just for specialized runs, maybe you're a company, right? You want to Christmas giveaways for your staff, maybe it's a couple hundred, couple thousand, that you can do very quickly. This is something that actually came up in a previous episode with Sarah Laflur where we were talking about apparel, but I think it applies more broadly, but she emphasized the importance of basically just China's expertise in doing this and the supply network that it's actually built up. So if you are a foreign investor or a US company or whatever and you go to China, like immediately people kind of know what to do now if you're asking for a factory. So I'm curious, is that replicable in a reasonable amount of time by places like Vietnam?</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 是的。你确实看到它正在被全面复制。我认为供应链不是在**重新定位**（Relocating: 搬迁），而是在**扩张和复制**（Expanding and Replicating: 扩大和复制）。所以本质上，再次强调，如果你是中国的一个杯子生产商，现在你会在越南或泰国生产。所以你现在有了这个迷你生态系统。你去找你在中国的不同供应商，你说：“嘿，我需要这个产品在我胡志明市旁边生产。你需要想办法给我弄到。”哦，这个包装商。好吧，你可能在河内有一个姊妹公司。好吧，现在我需要想办法接触到它。所以，你看到供应链正在该地区复制。例如，我关注供应链生态系统和5G组件。首先是先进基础设施。它不仅仅是港口和铁路。它还包括5G、电网、下水道等。其次是人才和教育体系。你将从哪里获得工人？而且，随着事物的发展，例如人工智能，你将如何培训他们进入这些新领域？第三是政府支持，这有点显而易见。第四是原材料获取和/或加工能力。当你实际查看中国所做的事情时，它没有很多原材料，但它在加工方面拥有专业知识。第五是技术。现在，中国在大多数行业都拥有这些。例如，美国在航空航天领域拥有它。欧洲也有。但就此而言，这就是我评估供应链生态系统的方式。所以当我与客户甚至政策制定者合作时，他们会说，那越南呢？我会在那五个关键领域的背景下看待它，因为那会告诉我差距在哪里，以及我们需要实际改进的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is. And you are seeing you are seeing it being replicated overall. I argue that supply chains aren't uh relocating, but they're expanding and replicating. So essentially, again, if you're a cut producer in China, now you're going to make it in Vietnam or Thailand. So you have this now mini ecosystem. You go to your different suppliers in China, you say, "Hey, I need this product next to me in Ho Chi Min. You need to figure out how to get me that." Oh, this packaging guy. Okay, you have a sister company maybe in Hanoi. Okay, now I need to figure out how to access that. So, you're seeing the replication of supply chains around the region. For example, I look at supply chain ecosystems and 5G components. The first is advanced infrastructure. It's not just ports and railroads. It's also things like 5G, the electrical grid, sewers. Second is talent and educational apparatus. Where are you going to get the workers from? But also, as things evolve, for example, AI, how are you going to train them up into these new areas? The third is government support, which is kind of obvious. The fourth is raw material access and or the ability to process it. When you actually look at what China does, it doesn't have a lot of raw materials, but it has expertise in the processing. And the fifth is technology. Now, China has this in most industries across the board. The US has it for example in aerospace. Europe does too. But just in terms of so that's how I evaluate a supply chain ecosystem. So when I work with customers or even policy makers and they say well what do we what about Vietnam? I look at it in context of those five key areas because that will tell me where the gaps are and where we need to actually improve.</p>
</details>

### 中国制造业的规模与优势

主持人 Tracy: 谈谈这个过程。我的意思是，如果越南有能力超越中国，它就会是中国，或者达到那个规模。所以，显然存在差距，这以前也出现过。那好吧，假设有一家中国公司生产X或Y产品。比如说他们生产体育用品之类的。他们想在越南增加低端产品的产量，但大概在基础设施、原材料获取等这五个类别中仍然存在一些不足。他们如何才能在考虑到中国和越南之间的差距的情况下，让在越南的制造业变得经济实惠呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Talk about that process. I mean, if Vietnam had the talent to beat China, it would be China or be at that scale. So, obviously there's a gap and this is something that's come up before. What does All right, let's say there's a Chinese company that makes X or Y. Let's say they're making sporting goods or something like that. They want to have more production of the low-end in Vietnam, but presumably there is still some deficiency of some of these five categories including infrastructure, including access to raw materials. What is their process for making it such that given the gap between China and Vietnam that that manufacturing in Vietnam does become economical?</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 嗯，部分原因在于，再次强调，就是较低的SKU水平，对吧？所以如果你看看冰球杆是如何生产的，例如，冰球杆有五个等级，从最好到最差，你有五个不同的等级。所以在这方面，你会把几支，你知道，可能是五级和四级，也许是四级和三级的冰球杆送到越南生产。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh well, part of it is uh again just the lower SKU level, right? So if you look at how hockey sticks, for example, are produced, there's five levels of hockey stick, the best to the to the worst, and you have five different levels. And so in that regard, you'll send a couple, you know, probably level five and four, maybe four and three to Vietnam to be produced.</p>
</details>

主持人 Jill: 听起来你有一个冰球杆客户。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It sounds like you've had a hockey stick client.</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 我有很多客户。嗯，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've had multiple clients. Um,</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 但你知道，最终，你关注的是哪里能获得最大的产量，不是最便宜的价格，而是问题最少的地方，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but you know, ultimately, you look at where you can get the largest amount of volume, not just at the cheap, not at the cheapest prices, but at the least amount of problems,</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 对吧？如果你销售的是，比如说，五级冰球杆，你知道，它不是NHL（National Hockey League: 国家冰球联盟）级别的，成本会更低，关税的影响会更大，更痛。如果你生产的是NHL级别的冰球杆，中国确实生产，那么关税是多少在那一点上并不重要，因为它们是专业水平的。无论如何你都必须有那种质量。所以乔，关于中国与越南，以及几乎是中国与世界其他地区相比的另一点是。中国大约有2.2亿制造业工人，约占其人口的28%。越南有1500万，约占30%。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right? If you're selling, let's say, a level five hockey stick where, you know, it's not NHL grade, the cost is going to be lower and the tariffs actually hit more and bite more. If you're making NHL grade hockey sticks, which they do make in China, it doesn't really matter what the tariff is at that point because they are expertise level. You have to have that quality regardless. And so the other thing Joe to your point about China versus Vietnam and pretty much China versus the rest of the world. China has about 220 million workers in manufacturing about 28% of its population. Vietnam has 15 million about 30. Yeah.</p>
</details>

主持人 Jill: 所以规模本身就是一种质量。人们真的不明白，这种差异不仅仅是中国在技术和不同的商业方式上前进。所有这些都是真的。但它确实是人才能力的巨大规模，你可以打电话说：“我需要一个圣诞杯，三个月内。”而且无论尺寸、形状或材料是什么，他们都会想办法做到。世界上没有其他人能做到这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so the scale is equality all into itself. And people just really don't understand that the difference is not just China moving forward in technology and in different ways of doing business. All of that is true. But it really is just the massive scale of ability of talent where you can call and say, "I need a Christmas cup in 3 months." And it doesn't matter what the size, shape, or material is. They'll figure out how to do it. And nobody else in the world can do that.</p>

主持人 Tracy: Tracy，我突然想到一个有趣的教训，这与我们之前关于美国零食仓库的节目有关，那就是随着技术进步，我们可以拥有更多的SKU。所以，当美国的仓库变得更加自动化时，它们在特定时间可以容纳的种类数量变得合理。你可以让机器人去后面挑选它们等等。所以听到关于SKU多样性是中国与世界其他地区之间的一个主要差距，这很有趣。

<p class="english-text">Tracy, it just clicked to me that there's an interesting lesson here that relates to the episode we did on snack food warehouses in the US, which is that with technological advance comes the ability to have more SKUs. So, as warehouses in the US got more roboticized, the sheer variety that they could hold at a given time made sense. You can have robots go behind and pick them out and so forth. And so it's interesting to hear like about like skew diversity as being this major sort of gap between China versus the rest of the world.</p>

### 劳动力成本与生产力

主持人 Tracy: 好的。但就此而言，劳动力成本是如何融入整个过程的？你能不能比较一下越南和中国目前的情况？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. But on this note, how do labor costs actually fit into this entire process? And can you maybe compare and contrast Vietnam and China right now?</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 所以劳动力成本，它确实，再次强调，它真的取决于行业。例如，如果你在复合材料等某些行业工作，你的劳动力成本实际上是总成本的一小部分。它真的不是材料，对吧？也许是碳纤维或玻璃纤维，树脂系统，机器。所以它们不相等。你真正需要看的是工人的生产力和效率，因为在那一点上，成本真的没那么重要，特别是考虑到关税，对吧？美国征收关税的最终原因，是他们想让制造业回流，但他们也想解决中国的**产能过剩**（Overcapacity: 生产能力超出市场需求）或产业政策问题。但现实是，在亚洲，劳动力在整体上并不像拥有这个生态系统那么重要。我可以获得更便宜的原材料。我有充足的电力。你知道，亚洲面临的挑战之一就是电网的稳定性。随着中国不断建设更多的电力基础设施，你看到越来越多的这种溢出效应，例如，越南大约20%的电力最终来自中国。所以你看到越来越多的溢出效应。所以这更多地不是关于每个工人的成本，因为例如在中国，特别是对于入门级白领工人，十年前，你可能每月有2.5万到3万人民币，大约是4千到5千美元。那可能是你的第一份入门级工作。现在这个水平减半了。部分原因是经济面临挑战。每年有大约1千万毕业生。同时，企业只是将他们用于与过去不同的事情。所以劳动力并不是关键组成部分，对吧？它是那五个关键领域之一，即人才。你肯定需要考虑它，但图中还有很多其他部分。其他亚洲国家的政府如何看待，你知道，美国显然对中国制造业的崛起感到焦虑，这是一个古老的故事，这意味着我们曾经历过对美国制造商等的“中国冲击”或欧洲制造商。马来西亚等国家是否存在类似的焦虑？我不知道他们是否还在生产Proton Saga（宝腾汽车）这款车，但你知道，这些国家有自己长期以来的民族品牌等等。他们是否对中国日益增长的影响力感到焦虑，无论是作为进口商品，还是仅仅在中国本土设厂？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So labor costs, it really again it really depends on the industry. For example, if you work in certain industries like composits, your labor cost actually is a small component of the overall cost. It really isn't the materials, right? The maybe the carbon or glass fibers, the resin systems, the machinery. So it's not equivalent. What you have to look at really is what's worker productivity and efficiency because at that point the cost really doesn't matter as much particularly with tariffs, right? The reason for tariffs ultimately according to the US is they want to reshore but they also want to deal with Chinese overcapacity or industrial policy. But the reality is in Asia labor across the board is not as important as it is such as I have this ecosystem. I have access to cheaper raw materials. I have plentiful electricity. You know, one of the challenges in Asia overall is just the stability of electrical grid. And as China continues to build out more and more of its own electrical infrastructure, you're seeing more of this actually play, for example, a certain amount of I think it's about 20% of Vietnam's electricity ultimately comes from China. And so you're seeing more and more of the spillover. So it's less about what is the cost per worker because for example in China, particularly with entry- level white collar workers, 10 years ago, you might have 25 to 30,000 R&B per month, which is roughly $4 to $5,000. That would be maybe your first entry- level job. Now that level is half. And part of that is because the economy is challenged. There's more plentiful graduates every year about 10 million. And at the same time, businesses are just using them for different things than they were in the past. So labor is not it's a part of the key component, right? It's part of that key five key areas, the talent. You definitely have to look at it, but there's a lot of other parts in the picture as well. How do uh the governments of other Asian nations feel about you know there's obviously anxiety in the US about what the rise of Chinese manufacturing which is an age-old story means you know meant that we had the China shock for American manufacturers etc to the or European ones is there similar anxiety among Malaysia for example I don't know if they still make the proton saga the car but you know these countries have their own sort of longtime national champions and so forth. Do they feel anxiety about the growing presence of Chinese power both as imports but also just setting up a shop at home?</p>

### 中国在东南亚的影响力与战略

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 嗯，在某种程度上总会有些犹豫，但现实是，作为制衡力量的美国却什么都没做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh to some degree there's always a hesitation but the reality is that the counterbalance to that the United States is not doing anything.</p>
</details>

主持人 Jill: 当然。所以，例如，我们最近几个月看到的一个现象是，当你谈论中国与美国的关系时。例如，在东南亚，中国领导人正在走访东南亚各地，与他们讨论市场机遇，我们正在关注什么。而美国则说：“来华盛顿吧，然后我们再决定怎么做。”它们非常不同，而且存在很多犹豫。你知道，例如，中国，根据我的经验，我最近去了东南亚。他们基本上正在与这些不同的国家讨论六个关键领域。首先是中国企业将继续在你们国家进行**FDI**（Foreign Direct Investment: 外国直接投资）或投资。美国企业则不会。美国企业将撤回北美。想想苹果就是一个很好的例子。所以这基本上就削弱了美国外交和影响力的一个关键组成部分。其次是我们有大量的受过良好教育的年轻工人。他们随时准备并愿意去其他地方。他们想去海外工作。他们想获得经验。也许他们有更好的工作机会。第三是我们可以分享技术。再次强调，人们看到，昨天有一篇文章谈到中国正在限制技术。这实际上并不是正在发生的事情。如果你想要2025年的技术，你可能得不到。但如果你想要2023年的技术，没问题，因为我们领先好几代。所以当你看看该地区的讨论时，你只需要这些，因为你的技术可能停留在2020年或更低水平。你需要那几个额外的步骤来真正推动你的增长。第四是仍然有很多承诺在该地区进行基础设施建设，但这不会是“一带一路”那种模式，而是“嘿，你需要某些港口，我们会努力建设这些港口；你可能需要电网或铁路连接昆明到新加坡”，这些都是你将越来越多看到的事情，因为它们再次推动了发展，各国都在说：“听着，我必须实现经济增长，我必须能够不断提高我人民的生活水平。”第五是，最近中国外交部长王毅与东盟（Azian）国家进行了很多讨论，关于与东南亚达成更多的贸易协议、自由贸易协议。第六点，就你而言，这也是我最近一次东南亚之行中从未听过的事情，而我从小就去那里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure. So for example, one of the one of the things we've seen particularly in the last couple of months is when you talk about how is China versus the US. For example, in Southeast Asia, Chinese leaders are going all around Southeast Asia talking to them about, hey, here's the market opportunities. Here's what we're looking at. The US is saying come to DC and then we'll figure out what we're going to do. They're very different and there is a lot of hesitation. You know, for example, China, you know, my experience, I went to Southeast Asia recently. They're essentially discussing six key areas with these different countries. The first is Chinese firms will continue to do FDI or investments in your countries. American firms are not. American firms are going to retrench to North America. Think of Apple as a prime example. So that basically takes away a key component of US diplomacy and also influence. Second is we have legions of young educated workers. They're ready and willing to go other places. They want to work overseas. They want to get that experience. Maybe they have better job opportunities. The third is we can share technology. And again, what people look like there was a an article yesterday about how China is restricting technology. That's actually not what's happening. If you want the technology of 2025, you're probably not going to get it. But if you want the technology of 2023, no problem because we're a couple generations ahead. So when you look at what the discussions are in the region, all you need is that because you're probably at a 2020 or below in terms of technology. You need those couple extra steps to actually fuel your growth. The fourth is there's still a lot of commitment to do infrastructure in region but it's not going to be a barrier a belt and road kind of thing but it will be hey you need certain ports we'll work that we'll build those out you need again maybe electrical grids or uh railroads connected kuning now down to Singapore those are the things that you're going to start to see more and more of because again they fuel and countries are like listen I have to have economic growth I have to be able to continually raise the standard of my people the fifth is there's a lot of discussion and foreign minister Wangi We had a discussion recently with the Azian countries about doing more trade agreements, free trade agreements with Southeast Asia. And the sixth one, to your point, and this is one in my most recent trip to Southeast Asia. I had never heard this before and I've been going there since I was a kid.</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 本质上，人们理解这些国家存在本土制造业或产业，而中国人承认我们可能不感兴趣，我们不想摧毁它们。这是我的解读，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Essentially, there's an understanding that there are local manufacturing or industries that are indigenous to these countries and the Chinese are acknowledging that we may not we're not interested in blowing those up. Those that's my interpretation,</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 但本质上是我们将对当地的担忧保持敏感。现在就你而言，这是否意味着所有情况都会发生？我不知道。但现实是，人们理解这里存在机遇，因为美国正在撤退，但同时，在做生意时让人们不高兴并不是一个好生意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but essentially that we're going to be sensitive to local concerns. Now to your point, does that mean it that happens in all cases? I don't know. But the reality is is that there is an understanding of there's an opportunity here because the US is withdrawing, but at the same time, it's just not good business to make people unhappy when we're doing business.</p>
</details>

### 美国政策的不确定性与全球影响

主持人 Tracy: 你提到了去华盛顿，我们一开始就讨论了我们并不真正知道关税是什么，我认为对于任何试图追踪它们的人来说都很难。现在你提到生产已经在对此做出反应。有没有人担心，比如两个月后，特朗普会突然改变立场，关税会取消或修改，从而改变在越南等地设厂的经济计算？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You mentioned going to Washington and we opened this discussion by talking about how well we don't really know what the tariffs are and I think it's difficult for anyone who's trying to track them. Now you mentioned that production is already moving in response to this. Is there any concern that like in 2 months Trump is just going to reverse position and the tariffs are going to go away or be altered and that changes the economic calculation for setting something up in say Vietnam.</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 我认为总体上缺乏对我们前进方向的信心，而且没有任何明确性。你说得对，这种反复无常的情况确实存在，但又不是完全如此。供应链需要大约15到20年才能完全发展起来。你可能在几年内就能建好一家工厂，但这并不意味着你拥有原材料、人员和建立业务所需的其他关键组成部分。所以，是的，这不仅不确定，而且所有其他国家都在说，中国不会那样对我们。我给你举个例子，孟加拉国，对吧？人口比俄罗斯还多。他们对中国是0%的关税。他们对美国是35%的关税。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think there's just a lack of confidence overall of the direction we're going and there's no clarity whatsoever. And you're right, this kind of back and forth it is but it isn't. It is but it isn't. Supply chains take probably 15 to 20 years to fully develop. You may be able to build a factory in a couple, but that again that doesn't mean you have the raw materials, the people, and the other key components that you need to build out your business. And so, yeah, it's not only uncertain, but all these other countries are going, China's not doing that to us. I'll give you an example, Bangladesh, right? Population larger than Russia. They have a 0% tariff to China. They have a 35% to the US.</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 那么，你认为他们会更喜欢哪一个？他们显然会与中国做更多的生意。最终，这就是关税的问题。如果关税是：“听着，这是每个国家的标准税率。当然，它会根据市场需求等因素波动。我们希望美国产品能有更多的市场准入到你们国家。”人们普遍认为这可能会发生。也许并非所有情况都完美，但现实是，目前的做法基本上让美国处于非常糟糕的境地。而我们最需要的人，却是受苦最深的人。我们认为这种情况能持续多久，直到他们说：“够了。我们要和中国人合作。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, which one do you think they're going to prefer more? They're obviously going to do more business with China. And ultimately, this is the issue with the tariffs. If the tariff was, listen, this is the standard rate per country. Of course, it fluctuates depending on market need and so on. We want to have more market access into your own countries for American products. There's a general understanding that that's probably what could happen. Maybe not perfect in all cases, but the reality is is that the way it currently is, it basically puts the US in a horrible light. And the people who we need the most are the ones who are suffering the most. And how long do we think that's really going to be able to last before they're like, "That's enough. We're going to go with the Chinese."</p>
</details>

主持人 Jill: 中国从孟加拉国进口什么？因为我的印象是中国现在根本不怎么进口东西。不仅仅是从美国，而是现在任何东西的进口量都不大。部分原因是它在国内各种产品的生产能力已经大大提高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What does China import from Bangladesh? Because my impression that is that China just does not import that much period. Not just from the US, but is not a big importer of anything these days. In part because of how much it's been able to build out its domestic capacity in a range of things.</p>
</details>

主持人 Tracy: 也许是废金属。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Scrap metal maybe.</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 是的。你知道，服装，加工过的原材料，你知道，再次强调，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. You know, clothes, processed raw materials, you know, and again, it's</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 中国扩张1.0版本是我们直到2020年所拥有的。这意味着在国内，你在几乎所有方面都达到了世界级水平。现在我们看到的是中国2.0版本，即“中国走向世界”。所以这更多地不是关于孟加拉国向中国销售。这更多地是关于随着中国供应链和整体供应链的不断发展、复制和重新定位。现在孟加拉国也想在供应链的这个拼图中分一杯羹。这就是他们想要的。记住，中国正在与东盟和东南亚讨论的事情之一是，让你们的产品进入中国市场的准入。所以你可能会有中国制造商搬到孟加拉国，因为那里可能更便宜，或者他们有更好的原材料获取渠道，例如印度的棉花，然后他们可以在那里生产并销售回中国。所以供应链方面有很多事情可能会发生，我们甚至还没有经历过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">China expansion 1.0 0 was kind of what we had up until 2020. Meaning in the country you're world class at most everything you have. Now we're seeing China 2.0 which is China for the world. So it's less about Bangladesh selling to China. It's more about as the Chinese supply chains and supply chains in general continue to evolve, replicate, relocate. Now Bangladesh who wants a piece of that supply chain puzzle. That's what they want. And remember one of the things that China's discussing with Azion and Southeast Asia is market access for your products back into China. So you could have Chinese manufacturers who move to Bangladesh because maybe it is cheaper or they have better raw material access for India for cotton for example and then they could produce it and sell it back into China. So there's a lot of things that can actually happen across the board with supply chains that we haven't even experienced yet.</p>
</details>

主持人 Tracy: 你有没有看到任何中国公司可能将重心转移到国内市场销售？因为这当然符合政府的一个关键目标，那就是在一个储蓄一直很传统的经济体中，努力提振消费。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you see anyone maybe shifting focus Chinese companies shifting focus into selling domestically in the domestic market? Because of course that would dovetail with one of the government's key ambitions which is to try to boost consumption in an economy where saving has uh been pretty uh traditional.</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 我们确实看到了一些这种转变，但总体而言国内需求并不理想。**疫情**（COVID-19: 新型冠状病毒肺炎）时期留下了很多后遗症。一些西方产品仍然被视为比中国产品更好的选择。而且中国历来是一个储蓄型国家。中国人永远不会像美国人那样消费。这实际上是我与经济学家争论的一个问题，他们说中国人需要更多消费。当然。但这到底意味着什么？你必须达到实际的消费率是多少？因为如果你期望他们达到美国的消费率，那永远不会发生。所以你确实看到人们和公司仍在进行机器升级。他们仍然购买iPhone和华为，以及像美国人一样进行IT消费。而且他们比以前储蓄更多。再次强调，我认为这很大程度上是疫情时期造成的，但也与国内的其他挑战有关，社会福利的不确定性，以及人口老龄化等问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We do see some shift to that but domestic demand overall is not fantastic. There's a lot of hangover from the co years. Some western products are still seen as a better option than Chinese products. And also China historically is a saving nation. The Chinese are never going to buy like the Americans ever. And this is one of the actually debates I have with economists who say they need to buy more. Sure. But what does that actually mean? What is the actual rate you have to hit? Because if you expect them to do a US rate, that's never going to happen. So you do see people and companies are still spending on machinery upgrades. They're still buying iPhones and Huawei's and iT spending like Americans would spend. and they're saving more than they used to. Again, I would argue a lot of that's from the co years, but it's also has to do with other challenges inside the country, the social welfare uncertainty, these kinds of things as the population gets older.</p>
</details>

### 中国“产能过剩”的辩论与内部竞争

主持人 Jill: 实际上，谈谈中国正在进行的关于所谓“中国产能过剩”的辩论。因为美国经济学家喜欢谈论这个。有时我觉得这对我来说像是一种**“自欺欺人”**（Cope: 应对机制，此处指为无法竞争找借口）。就像是，哦，我们无法竞争，所以他们一定在作弊，对吧？所以他们一定是因为产能过剩而涌入我们的市场。另一方面，你确实不时看到北京领导人的评论，谈论各省之间进行无益、低效的**“逐底竞争”**（Race to the Bottom: 竞相降低标准以获得竞争优势），各省的龙头企业之间等等。请向我们解释一下，这个“产能过剩”的问题在中国是如何被“消化”的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Actually, talk about what is the sort of debate that's happening in China with regards to this idea of so-called Chinese over capacity because American econ economists love to talk about this. Sometimes it feels like cope to me. It's like, oh, we can't compete, therefore they must be cheating, right? Therefore, they must be flooding our market because they have this over capacity. On the other hand, you do see comments from leaders in Beijing from time to time talking about the provinces engaging in unhelpful, unproductive race to the bottom competition between each province's champion, etc. Explain to us like how this question of quote overcapacity is sort of metabolized in China.</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 嗯，产能过剩在很大程度上是“旁观者清”。如果你是消费者，在很多情况下，你喜欢产能过剩，因为价格会不断下降，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, over capacity is very much in the eye of the beholder. If you're a consumer, in many cases, you love over capacity because prices keep going down,</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 对吧？我认为你是对的。部分原因是，当你实际查看各项倡议和五年规划的建设情况时，很多都是“我们需要做X、Y和Z”。你知道，我们需要更多的AI数据中心。我们需要更多的电动汽车公司。因此，不同的地方政府或龙头企业将承担这些倡议。而这最终将导致产能过剩的论点。我认为需要认识到的另一点是，我们实际看待很多事情的完成方式。它的完成方式是为了弄清楚如何建立一个终极供应链，而不是一个最终产品。在这里，我们想制造一辆福特卡车。太棒了。这就是目标。但在中国，情况实际上是颠倒的。我们如何才能真正弄清楚每年如何制造一百万辆小米汽车？嗯，首先你必须弄清楚如何处理原材料、电池供应商或不同的零部件供应商等等。所以，这实际上是一个完整的分解。所以产能过剩实际上不仅仅存在于最终产品中。是的。它存在于整个国家的所有辅助产品，以及一级、三级、四级、五级、六级、七级供应商中。现在并非所有行业都一样。我不想让你的听众产生错误的看法，但以电动汽车为例。电动汽车的领导者不是**国有企业**（SOE: State-Owned Enterprise），它们都是私营公司。所以我们在中国看到的一个重大转变是，国有企业和传统汽车制造商现在在市场上拥有的不仅仅是主导地位，而是影响力都大大降低了。通常都是私营公司，所以这种产能过剩无疑是其中一个悬而未决的问题，也是一个挑战。你知道，我上周刚在欧洲，这是我一直与他们争论的问题之一。你们对德国和日本的产能过剩没意见，他们每年出口的商品比中国多得多。现在中国人也这么做，你们就有问题了，就像“拜托，伙计们，你们不能什么都要”。另一点是，在很多情况下，这就是你开发世界级技术的方式，例如在电动汽车领域，你拥有这种激烈的，这种**“内卷”**（nan: 形容内部激烈竞争），这种极其激烈的内部竞争，因为这就是你使用的词，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right? I I think you're right. Part of it is is that when you actually look at the buildout of initiatives and like a 5-year plan structure, a lot of it is we need to do X, Y, and Z. You know, we need to have more AI data centers. We need to have more EV companies. And so, different regional governments or champions will undertake those initiatives. And so, that ultimately will contribute to a buildout of the overcapacity argument. I think the other thing to realize is that we actually look at how a lot of this is done. It's done in a way to figure out how to build out an ultimate supply chain, not an end product. Here we want to make a Ford truck. Great. That's the goal. But in China, it's actually reversed. How do we actually figure out how to make a million Xiaomi cars every year? Well, first you have to figure out how to deal with the raw materials, the battery suppliers, or the different part suppliers and so on. So, it's actually a full breakdown. So the overcapacity actually isn't just in the final product. Yeah. It's in all the ancillary products in the tier 1, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh suppliers as well throughout the entire country. Now it's not the same in all industries. I don't want your listeners to get the wrong idea, but you take for example EVs. The leaders in EVs are not the SOEs, they're all the private companies. And so one of the significant shifts we've seen in China is that the S so ses and the traditional automotive manufacturers had now have a far less not just dominant position but influence in the market. It's all the private companies generally and so is that over capacity that's what definitely one of the overhangs for sure and one of the challenges you know I was just in Europe last week and this is one of the debates I keep having with them. you were fine with over capacity for Germany and Japan and they ultimately they're they're exported more much more every year than whatever China does. Now that the Chinese do it you have a you have an issue it's like come on guys like you can't have everything. The other thing is is that in many cases this is how you develop worldclass technology for example in EVs is you have this intense this nuan this extremely intense internal competition because that's what was the word you used</p>
</details>

主持人 Jill: 内卷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">nuan</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 是的，是内部，基本上是激烈的内部竞争，对吧？还有一个有趣的词最近经常出现，特别是由于最近针对**H20芯片**（H20 chips: 一种高性能计算芯片，可能是对H100的误称或特定型号）的举动，叫做**“掐脖子”**（chabodza: 形容扼制、卡住关键环节），基本上意味着你在扼杀我们。所以中国人用这个词来指美国人说：“嘿，你们用半导体管制和其他一切来扼杀我们的产业。”现在又有一个新的讨论，关于中国新的“掐脖子”是：“哦，我们有稀土，所以现在我们也可以这么做。”所以，当你谈论产能过剩时，这是一种有趣的现象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it's internal basically fierce internal competition right there's another interesting word that has come out a lot particularly because of the recent moves with the H20s is called chabodza basically meaning you're strangling us and so the Chinese have used this in terms of the Americans saying Hey, you're strangling our industry with semiconductor controls and everything else and now there's a new discussion about the new chab in China is oh we have rare earths so now we can also do it right so and this is kind of an interesting when you talk about over capacity</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 我讨论的一部分，当你审视供应链时，它确实取决于供应链，也取决于它在哪里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">part of my discussion when you look at supply chains it really depends on the supply chain but also where it is</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 例如，如果你是澳大利亚，产能过剩是件好事，因为你可以从中国获得便宜的汽车，对吧？日本人不喜欢，因为他们正在失去市场份额，举个例子。那么它到底在哪里发挥作用呢？关于产能过剩的一个有趣之处在于，它不仅仅是最终产品的产能过剩，而是整个供应链的产能过剩。所以这是导致中国在全球化的原因之一，因为这种“内卷”，这种激烈的内部竞争，很多公司如果不能赚很多钱，甚至根本赚不到钱，所以他们必须走出去。所以你现在看到的是，当他们走出去时，他们正在建立供应链。比亚迪（BYD）就是一个完美的例子，他们实际上正在将整个生态系统带出去。所以虽然这可能是中国内部的产能过剩，但对中国以外生态系统其他部分的好处是，你现在可以获得更便宜的技术和整体产品，你可以在当地生产。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">for example over capacity is great if you're Australia because you're getting cheap automotive cars out of China right the Japanese don't like it because they're losing market share as an example so where does it actually work out one of the interesting things about overcapacity is it's not just over capacity again in the final product it's the entire supply chain so this is one of the things that's contributing to China global in China because of this nan this fierce internal competition companies a lot of them cannot make very much money if any so they have to go out so what you're seeing now as they go out they're building supply chains BYD is a perfect example they're actually bringing that entire ecosystem with them so while it may be over capacity inside China the benefits to other parts of the ecosystem outside of China is now you got access to cheaper technology and products overall that you can build locally.</p>

### 中国在AI领域的领先地位

主持人 Tracy: 我有太多问题了，我必须集中精力，但好吧，总的来说，你认为对中国技术的打压是加速了中国的技术发展还是阻碍了它？我认为它绝对加速了它，因为再次回到前面提到的供应链生态系统的五个部分，它本质上将整个国家和所有公司都集中在一个目标上，那就是我们必须想办法让它奏效，对吧？因为它现在是对我们业务的生存威胁。我从小在中国学到的一件事是，永远不要让中国人专注于一个问题，因为他们会攻击并解决那个问题。与此同时，你也会看到大量的资源投入，而且它非常密集，有时会浪费，但最终结果非常明确。你拥有世界级的公司和技术。

<p class="english-text">I have so many questions I have to focus but okay net net would you say that the crackdown on Chinese technology has accelerated China's technological development or hindered it? I'd say it's definitely accelerated it because again referring to those five parts of the supply chain ecosystem earlier it essentially focused everything in the entire country and all the companies into this we have to figure out how to make this work right because it's now it's an existential threat to our businesses the one thing I've learned since I've been in China as a kid never focus the Chinese on a problem because they will attack and kill that problem and with that you also see the expenditure of massive amounts of resources and it is very intensive it is sometimes waste But the end result is pretty clear. You have worldclass companies and technology.</p>
</details>

主持人 Jill: 谈到资源，我记得我在香港的时候，中国政府打击了教育公司，以及他们所谓的“浪费性资本”。他们基本上公开表示，他们希望鼓励更多的资金投入高科技企业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Speaking of resources, so one thing I remember from my time in Hong Kong was the Chinese government cracked down on education companies and what they termed wasteful capital. And they basically came out and said they wanted to encourage more money to go into high-tech businesses.</p>
</details>

主持人 Jill: 这种情况还在发生吗？另外，你有没有看到资金，政府资金，也许是针对其他行业的贷款标准正在放宽？基本上，中国是否正在利用融资来鼓励其他类型的行业扩张、走向海外等等？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is that still happening? And then also, do you see money, government money, maybe lending standards being eased up for other industries? Basically, is China using financing to encourage other types of industries to be able to like expand, go abroad, things like that.</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 所以，他们不一定像美国那样使用融资，比如“嘿，这里有一个进出口银行给你”，例如波音公司。但他们正在做的是，特别是在各种激励措施方面，想想人工智能，例如，他们正在为整个生态系统提供不同程度的支持，也许这种支持是一些资金，也许这种支持是一种保证，即“我们将在X年内购买你X数量的产品”，也许是“我们将与大学合作，调整和改变我们的教育计划，以便我们能够以更有效的方式培训新工程师进入商业领域”，这就是我们看到变化的地方。十年前，更多的是金融刺激、金融激励，通过税收优惠等方式进入系统。但现在我们看到这些调整和变化，因为他们明白金钱不是万能的。你还需要建立所有这些其他组成部分，才能在一个行业中真正前进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, they're not necessarily using financing like, hey, here's an import export bank for you, such as the US, for example, with Boeing. What they are doing though is particularly on on you know with different incentives think AI for example they are providing the entire ecosystem different levels of support maybe that support is some finance maybe the support is a guarantee of we'll buy x amount of your product over x number of years maybe it's we're going to work with universities to tweak and change our educational program so we can actually train the new engineers in terms of a more effective way to go into business that's where we see the changes 10 years ago it would be more financial stimulus financial incentives going out into tax incentives and so on going into the system. But now we're seeing these tweaks and changes because they understand that money isn't everything. You also have to build out all these other components to actually move forward in an industry.</p>
</details>

主持人 Jill: 谈谈人工智能。你知道，显然我们今年早些时候经历了**DeepSeek**（DeepSeek: 一种人工智能模型）时刻。感觉就像是远古历史了。你试过**Kimmy**（Kimmy: 一种人工智能模型）了吗？你听说过这个吗？有一家公司叫Moonshot，他们有一个新模型叫Kimmy。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Talk to us about AI. You know, obviously we had a the Deep Seek moment that was just earlier this year. Kind of feels like ancient history. Have you tried Kimmy yet? Have you heard of this one? There's some company called Moonshot and they have a new model called Kimmy</p>
</details>

主持人 Jill: 有些人说它比DeepSeek更好。我不确定。所以，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and some people are saying it's better than Deep Seek. I'm not sure. So,</p>
</details>

主持人 Tracy: 你试过吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">have you tried it?</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 是的。你知道，它们看起来都挺好。看起来非常好。你知道，它们看起来都差不多。但人工智能竞赛在中国看起来是怎样的？我们知道它从你的DeepSeek时刻等角度看起来是怎样的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. You know, they all kind seemed fine. It seemed very good. You know, they all kind of look the same. But how does the AI race look for we know how it looks from the perspective of your deepseat moments etc. What does the AI race look like in China?</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 你知道，这很有趣。嗯，这真的取决于你和谁交谈，但我个人认为中国在人工智能方面领先，而且差距不小。当你看看

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know it's interesting. Um it really depends on who you talk to but my personal belief is that China's ahead in AI and it's not even close. When you look at</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 是的，当你看看DeepSeek时刻，那是一个分水岭，但有100个DeepSeek的同等产品正在上线。我们只看到了其中10个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah when you look at when you look at the deepseek moment it was a watershed but there's 100 deepseek equivalents that are coming online. We've only seen 10 of them</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 对吧？好吧。我不知道美国有什么同等产品，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right? All right. I don't know what the equivalents are in the states,</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 但当你再次看看基础设施等，中国拥有大量的电力可以建设。他们正在不断建设他们的电网。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but when you look at again things like infrastructure, China has copious amounts of electricity they can build out. They're constantly building out their electricity grid.</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 去年，也就是2024年，他们建设了380吉瓦的电力。美国只有60或80吉瓦，我不记得具体数字了，但本质上这给了他们巨大的空间来建设所有这些人工智能、所有这些数据中心和人才。我三月底在上海参加半导体展时，那里有一个**SEMIU**（SEMIU: 旨在帮助年轻毕业生进入未来领域的组织）的展位，这个组织的目标是帮助年轻毕业生进入未来的领域。去年我与他们交谈时，他们主要是在帮助年轻毕业生获得实习和介绍。今年他们说，将有10万名毕业生进入五个关键行业：人工智能、量子计算、机器人、半导体和电池。现在，每年10万人，这比所有西方国家的总和还要多。到本世纪末，他们希望达到50万人。这比全世界的总和还要多。当你实际看看中国是如何在人工智能领域进行建设时，我岔开一下，当你只看电池化学时，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Last year in 2024, they had 380 gawatts built out. The US only had 60 or maybe 80, I don't remember off the top of my head, but essentially that gives them a huge runway to build out all of these AI, all of these data centers, the talent. I was at the semiconductor show in Shanghai at the end of March and they had a booth there semiu and essentially this the goal of this organization is to help young graduates get into the fields of the future. Last year when I talked to them it was very much oh we're trying to help young graduates get internships and introductions. This year it was hey we're going to have 100,000 graduates go into five key industries. AI, quantum computing, robotics, semiconductors and batteries. Now, a 100,000 per year, that's more than all of the Western world combined. By the end of the decade, they want to have half a million. That's more than the entire world combined. And when you actually look at how China is building out again in this AI situation, and I'll sidestep a minute, when you just look at battery chemistry,</p>
</details>

主持人 Tracy: 是的，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah,</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 中国有50个电池化学和冶金研究生项目。美国并没有那么多。他们只有几个教授。所以当你再次看看人才、政府支持时，这不仅仅是“嘿，伙计们，我们想使用人工智能”。而是全国每个孩子，从幼儿园开始，一直到大学。我的孩子们现在都被要求从今年秋天开始接受人工智能教育。整个国家的整个体系。所以再次强调，当你看看这些不同的领域时，我就想：“嘿，等等，伙计们。这不具可比性。”我给你举个例子。我在中国南方的一家消费品制造商那里，我认识并与他们合作。他们的工厂里有DeepSeek。他们在中国有五家工厂，东南亚有几家。我就问：“你生产消费品，为什么会有DeepSeek？”他回答说：“Cameron，我们有很多不同的产品，我们想弄清楚如何使用它。我们有100多名研发和技术人员。由于贸易战，消费品业务进展缓慢。我正试图让他们在有时间的时候弄清楚如何使用它。”所以，我去找技术团队。技术团队正在与整个供应链讨论如何使用DeepSeek和这些不同的程序来更有效地开展业务和解决问题。所以他给我看了他的微信系统。他的微信群里有数百人。他们是塑料供应商。他们是原材料生产商、包装商。他们会说：“哦，是的，你知道，我看了微信动态。哦，这个没用。试试这个。那样做。我不知道这是什么意思。你在这里看到了什么？”整个供应链都在积累大量的知识，从原材料生产商一直到最终零部件制造商，即**OEM**（Original Equipment Manufacturer: 原始设备制造商）。然后他说，顺便说一句，这现在正在越南和泰国发生，因为那里有很多中国管理人员，现在他们的供应商是越南人或泰国人，所以你看到整个供应链都在大规模地复合增长。而这只是一个公司，乔，波音公司在这样做吗？陶氏化学（Dow Chemical）在这样做吗？宝马（BMW）在这样做吗？我认为没有，这就是为什么我认为中国在人工智能竞赛中遥遥领先。人们认为我们有突破，我们有这个那个。这绝对是真的。美国在这方面100%领先。但我称之为形而上学与有形。美国和西方将在形而上学的发现和所有其他方面表现出色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">China has 50 graduate programs of battery chemistry and metallergy in it. The US doesn't really have that. They have a couple professors. And so when you look at again the talent, the government support, it's not just, hey guys, we want to use AI. It's every kid in the country now from kindergarten all the way on up. I mean, even my own kids now, they are mandated starting this fall to have AI education. The entire apparatus in the whole country. And so again, when you look at these different areas, I'm like, hey, wait a minute, guys. Like this is not comparable. I'll give you an example. I was in uh southern China at a consumer goods manufacturer who I've known and I do work with. They have DeepSeek in the factory. They have five factories in China, a couple Southeast Asia. I'm like, why do you who make consumer why do you have Deep Seek? And he goes, Cameron, we have a lot of different products and we want to figure out how to use it. We have over 100 R&D and technical guys. Business is slow because consumer goods in the trade war. I'm trying to have them figure out while we have the time how to use it. So, I go talk to the technology team. The technology team is talking to the entire supply chain how to use DeepSseek and these different programs to do more efficient business and solve problems. So he shows me his WeChat system. He's got hundreds of people in a WeChat group. They're plastic providers. They're raw material producers, the packaging guys. And there's like, oh yeah, they'll say, you know, I looked at the the WeChat feed. Oh, this didn't work. Try this. Do that. I don't know what this means. What are you seeing here? was the entire supply chains are having this massive compounding knowledge throughout all of it from the raw material producer all the way down to the final component manufacturer the OEM then he says by the way this is now happening in Vietnam and Thailand because there it's a lot of Chinese management and now their suppliers which are Vietnamese are Thai so you're seeing this massive compound throughout all of the supply chains and that's just one company Joe is Boeing doing that is Dowo Chemical doing that is BMW doing that I would argue no and this is why in my And China is very far ahead in the AI race. People look at it as we have breakthroughs, we have this and that. And that's absolutely true. The US is 100% ahead in that. But I call it the metaphysical versus the tangible. The US and the West is going to be great at the metaph metaphysical discoveries and everything else.</p>

### 劳动力转型与机器人技术

主持人 Tracy: 你在这里提到了很多年轻人和教育系统，但我认为这仍然是劳动力的一次转变，对吧？所以，如果更多的工厂工作从中国转移到越南，这意味着国内的工厂工作会减少。所有这些，贸易战，中国私营公司的反应，在目前中国国内对青年失业等问题存在很多焦虑的时候，这会如何影响国内政治？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You mentioned young people and the education system quite a bit here, but I imagine this is still a shift in the labor force, right? So, if more factory jobs are going from China to Vietnam, that means fewer factory jobs domestically. How does all of this, the trade war, the responses from private companies in China, how does that play into domestic politics at a time when there's been a lot of anxiety within China about things like youth unemployment?</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 它更多地是团结而不是分裂。嗯，因为再次强调，它给了他们一个焦点。我们需要抵制我们正在遭受的攻击。它实际上在很多方面产生了相反的效果。我认为另一点是人们明白今天的行业不会是明天的行业。所以我们必须提升技能，我们必须培训我们的工人，我们必须更多地自动化。如果我们确实有一个对我们来说不盈利的零部件，我们可以把它送到东南亚，它就会盈利。所以我们需要探索这一点。所以你看到他们有不同的方式来解决这个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It unifies it more than disunifies it. Um because again, it gives them a focus. We need to stand up against the attacks that we're receiving. It's actually having the opposite effect in many ways. I think the other thing is people understand that the industry of today is not going to be the industry of tomorrow. So we have to upskill, we have to train our workers, we have to automate more. If we do have a part or component that really just isn't profitable for us, we can send it to Southeast Asia and it will be profitable. So we need to explore that. So you're seeing there different ways that they can attack that problem.</p>
</details>

主持人 Jill: 我还有一个问题，我也担心它会导向一个令人沮丧的答案，但我记得**邓小平**（Deng Xiaoping）曾将2049年设定为目标，比如，到2049年我们将建成一个现代化的社会主义国家，也许是一个现代化的共产主义国家之类的。而实现这一目标的一种方式似乎就是让机器人做所有事情。我知道中国在人形机器人方面投入了大量资金，如果你真的能拥有一个或多或少像人一样移动的机器人，那将带来令人难以置信的生产力提升。显然，美国也在努力，特斯拉（Tesla）就在这个领域。你能谈谈中国人形机器人产业的现状吗？它们对减轻人类劳动负担的贡献，以及这个行业的竞争愿景是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have one more question and I'm also worried it's going to be sort of leading to a depressing answer, but I think it was 2049 that Deng Xiaopang targeted for like, okay, by 2049 we'll have achieved a modern socialist state, maybe a modern communist state or something like that. And it seems like one way you could get there is just like have robots do everything. And I know there's a lot of investment in China in humanoid robotics, which if you could really have a, you know, a robot that more or less moved like a person, pretty incredible productivity gains. There's efforts here obviously and Tesla's in that space. Can you talk a little bit about like the state of the Chinese humanoid robotics industry, their contribution to essentially reducing the burdens of human labor and what the sort of competitive vision for that industry is?</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 我认为竞争愿景仍在构建中，因为我们仍然不确切知道它们能做什么和不能做什么。例如，人形机器人将非常擅长重复性任务，无论它们是在装配线上，还是也许我有一个

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the competitive the competitive vision is still being built out because again we don't know exactly what they can and can't do. For example, humanoid robots will be great at repetitive tasks, whether they're on an assembly line or maybe it's I have</p>
</details>

主持人 Tracy: 我看到一个视频，一个全自动加油站，机器人给油箱加满了油。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I saw a video of a full-ervice gasoline station where the robot filled up the tank.</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 当然。我的意思是，再次强调，那些是重复性的。你只能为它们编程一定数量的变量。但像，你知道，当我从事碳纤维工作时，我们做了很多纺织品生产，你必须将非常细的纤维穿入小孔，才能送入机器。这将在很长一段时间内由人类完成，因为它非常复杂，看起来很简单，但实际上非常复杂。我们必须将所有东西对齐，准确地绑好等等。我认为机器人技术总体上需要关注的领域是，你是否拥有供应链生态系统？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure. I mean, again, those are repetitive. You can only program them for a certain number of variables. But things like, you know, when I was working in carbon fiber, we did a lot of textile production where you had to essentially thread very thin fibers into eyelet holes to feed into the machine. that will be done by humans for a very long time because it's a very com it seems simple but it's actually very complex. We have to line everything up, tie everything in accurately and so on. I think the area to look at for robotics in general is again do you have the supply chain ecosystem?</p>
</details>

主持人 Tracy: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 中国拥有从原材料加工（例如磁铁）一直到安装的整个供应链。这就是为什么最终，再次强调，鉴于我们目前的状况，中国将继续领先发展。特斯拉这样做很棒。他们绝对应该这样做。竞争对每个人都更好，但你的磁铁仍然来自中国。现在，这在未来会成为问题吗？也许不会，也许会。我认为这有待商榷。最终，当你看看它将如何影响社会时，我们只是不知道。我认为需要关注的一点是，随着他们在这些领域不断发展供应链生态系统，无论哪个行业，无论是机器人、半导体还是造纸，现实是，因为你拥有国内所有这些，你可以比世界上其他地方更好地进行修修补补。所以当你实际谈论创新进步和即时修补的能力时，中国在这方面是世界级的，这通常是因为他们拥有所有不同的零部件。你之前谈到了圣诞城。那是因为你可以在那个城市买到所有圣诞节需要的东西。你可以买到螺丝、金银丝、红色、粉色，无论是什么。所有这些都因为那个生态系统存在。它在未来为你提供了更大的灵活性来构建一些东西。乔，你认为新泽西州会如何回应机器人加油？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And China has that from all the way from the raw material processing for example for the magnets all the way down into the installation. And that's why ultimately again given where we are currently China will continue to grow ahead. It's great that Tesla does it. They absolutely should. competition is better for everybody, but you still get your magnets from China. Now, will that become a problem in the future? Maybe not, maybe it will. I think that's to be debated. Ultimately, when you look at how it will affect society, we just don't know. I think the one thing to look at though is as they continue to grow the supply chain ecosystems in these areas and regardless of industry, whether it's robotics, it's semiconductors, it's making paper, the reality is is because you have all of that in your country, you can tinker with it a lot better than other places in the world. So when you actually talk about the innovation advancements and the ability to tinker on the fly, which China is world class at, it's often because they have all the different pieces and component parts. You talked about the Christmas city earlier. And that's because you can get everything for Christmas in that city. You can get the screws, you can get the tinsel, you can get a color red, you can get a pink, whatever it may be. And all of that because that ecosystem exists there. It gives you far more flexibility in the future to build something out. Joe, how do you think New Jersey would respond to gas pumping robots?</p>

主持人 Tracy: 哦，是的。

<p class="english-text">Oh, yeah.</p>

主持人 Tracy: 可能会有两种结果。可能会有两种结果。比如，强制性全方位服务加油对工人来说是一种福利，还是仅仅对司机来说是一种有保障的福利？我能说出我内心的想法吗？

主持人 Tracy: 说出我内心的想法，那就是我喜欢在新泽西州加油。当然。你知道，是的，我喜欢偷懒，我喜欢有一个理由，因为如果我不在新泽西州，我会自己加油以省钱。但我喜欢有一个借口，比如，哦，你知道，我不得不这样做，然后我就可以坐在车里。所以，我不会抱怨。

</details>

主持人 Jill: 乔，那没那么糟糕。嗯，没那么内疚。我还有一个问题，这是一个非常基本的问题，但也许你可以向我们解释一下，或者至少给我们一些关于这些关税的实际文书工作是如何运作的，比如公司为了将商品运到美国需要经历哪些繁琐程序，考虑到关税税率似乎每天都在变化。我会把他们推荐给我最好的报关行，因为我不处理那个，特别是就你而言，因为它不断变化和发展。规则也在变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's not that bad, Joe. Um, not that guilty. I have just one more question and it's a really basic one, but maybe you could walk us through or at least give us some color on how the actual paperwork works for these tariffs, like the hoops that companies are having to jump through in order to get goods to the US given that the tariff rate seems to change day by day. I would refer them to my best customs broker because I don't I don't deal with that because particularly to your point because it's constantly changing and evolving. The rules are changing.</p>

### 贸易政策的复杂性与未来展望

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 有一天你不能运输H20芯片，第二天你就可以，对吧？有一天你没有任何稀土，第二天你就可以，但它们仍然被征收关税和税款，但税率是多少？因为如果你从东南亚获得，它的关税税率与中国不同，但它们都来自中国。这实际上是如何运作的？现实是它现在如此复杂，以至于需要聘请专业人士，因为我就是这样做的。好吧，我想我再问你一个问题，它与对话的开头有关，关于中国制造商在越南和其他亚洲国家建立更多的供应链。你听到的一件事是，我们必须警惕所谓的**“转运”**（Trans-shipment: 货物通过第三国转运以规避关税），我理解的意思是，中国制造的东西在越南停下来喝杯咖啡，然后又装上另一艘船，突然之间，它就伪装成越南制造的进口商品。但听起来，这个愿景是，这变得无关紧要，或者说，这是一种不必要的行为，实际上它是一家中国公司，但它实际上是在越南制造的，最终，“转运”的概念，即商品只是通过越南，是一种暂时现象，但最终它将在越南制造，而且公司的愿景不是将越南用作中转站，而是将其用作来源地。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One day you can't move H20 chips and the next day you can, right? One day you don't have any rear earth, the next day you can, but they're still tariffed and taxed and but at what rate are they tariff and tax? Because if you get it out of Southeast Asia, it's now a different tariff rate than China, but they both come from China. How does that actually work? The reality is it's so complex now that hire a professional because that's what I do. Well, I guess I'll ask you one more question then and it relates to the very beginning of the conversation about Chinese manufacturers building out more of their supply chain in Vietnam and other Asian countries. And one of the things you hear about is we have to guard against so-called like trans shshipment which I just take to mean there's something made in China and then it stops for a cup of coffee in Vietnam and then puts on another boat and suddenly you know it's a disguised important made to look like Vietnam. It sounds like though the vision is that that just becomes irrelevant or that that's an unnecessary thing that actually it is a Chinese company but it's actually made in Vietnam and that ultimately the idea of like trans shipment the idea of just like something passing through Vietnam is like a temporary thing but in the end it will just be made in Vietnam and that the companies and that the vision is not to use Vietnam as a pass through the vision is to use Vietnam as the source.</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 不，你是对的。我认为转运的问题在于，现在使用的定义非常“2018年”。它并不是真正正在发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, you're correct. I think the issue with trans shshipment is the definition that is used now is very 2018. It's not really what's happening.</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 当然，偶尔仍然会发生。我并不否认这一点。但当你实际查看正在发生的事情时，是原材料和半加工的中间产品进入越南，然后进行加工并运出。现在，在哪个点上它是越南制造还是中国制造，你知道，这实际上是一个没有人知道答案的争论，我们也没有从政府那里得到关于这到底是什么的指导。是X数量的内容，就像**MSCA**（Mexico-United States-Canada Agreement: 美墨加协定）那样，还是其他什么？我们不知道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Of course, it still happens on occasion. I'm not denying that. But when you actually look at what's happening, it's the raw materials and semi-processed intermediate goods that are coming into Vietnam and then being processed and moved on. Now, at what point is that Vietnamese versus Chinese, you know, that actually is the debate that nobody knows the answer to and we haven't received guidance on from the government about what that actually is. Is it x amount of content like it it has been the MSCA or is it something else? We don't know.</p>
</details>

主持人 Jill: 你知道，你听到的一件事，我们也在播客中谈论过，那就是任何在中国待了10年、20年、30年的人，都看到了这段时间生活水平的巨大进步。我从未去过越南。考虑到所有这些投资，一个今天40岁或更年轻的越南人，你会说在过去10年里，这些其他国家的生活质量和基础设施是否发生了巨大变化？

<p class="english-text">You know, one of the things you hear and we've talked about this on the podcast is that anyone who's been in China for 10, 20, 30 years has seen extraordinary advances in standard of living over this period of time. I've never been to Vietnam. Given all this investment, would someone who's uh 40 years old in Vietnam today or younger like in the last 10 years, would you say the quality of life and the quality of infrastructure is massively changed in some of these other countries?</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 是的，我会说生活水平和就业机会也得到了改善，对吧？政府是否会在社会服务方面拥有更多资金，因为他们有更好的税收，因为有更多的资金流入。所有这些在该地区都得到了全面改善。绝对如此。我实际上还有一个最后一个问题，那就是这并不是我们第一次看到美国对中国征收关税。显然，在特朗普第一届政府期间，我们也有限制，尽管显然没有现在那么严格。我有点把它们看作是中国关税的“练习”。所以，我很好奇，从第一轮关税中，你学到或目睹或看到的最令人惊讶的事情是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I I would say that it's also that the standard of living, the job opportunities, right? Are the government's going to have more money in their coffers for social services because they have better taxation because there is more money coming in. All of that is improved across the board in the region. Absolutely. I actually have one last question, which is this isn't the first time that we've seen the US impose tariffs on China. Obviously, in the first Trump administration, we had restrictions, although clearly not as stringent as they are now. I kind of think of them as like maybe practice tariffs for China. So, I'm curious, what was the most surprising thing that you learned or witnessed or saw from the first round of tariffs?</p>
</details>

主持人 Tracy: 来自最初的贸易战关税。

<details>

<p class="english-text">From the original trade war tariffs.</p>
</details>

主持人 Jill: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 我认为最让我惊讶的是，美国不明白这基本上是在挤压一个气球。如果你把它们从中国挤出去，它们会去其他地方，特别是东南亚。通过这样做，**“除了中国以外的任何地方”**（ABC: Anywhere But China）的策略实际上已经巩固了中国在东南亚的影响力。而且它永远不会，我们永远不会回到相反的情况，特别是考虑到我们目前正在做的事情。所以对我来说，更令人惊讶的是美国方面，从战略上我们如何思考这些事情，以及我们如何预测未来5年、10年、15年、20年，即使这曾是一个考虑因素，它也没有得到足够的重视。这些是更让我惊讶的事情。当然，一家公司如果被征收关税，它会去外面建立工厂。当然，内部竞争激烈的公司会希望进入新市场，在那里他们可以获得更多利润。这会发生，这是商业。但当你实际审视地缘政治和地缘政治的演变，特别是关于中国，如果你再次试图将中国逼入困境，你不会期望得到预期的结果，对吧？而在这场贸易战1.0的特定案例中，结果是它巩固了中国在东南亚的影响力。贸易战2.0的结果，虽然我们不知道，但本质上正在巩固中国在亚洲、非洲和欧洲供应链中的领先地位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the thing that I was most surprised at is that the US didn't understand that it's basically squeezing a balloon. If you squeeze them out of China, they'll go somewhere else, but particularly to Southeast Asia. And that by doing that, the calculus of ABC anywhere but China has now actually cemented Chinese influence in Southeast Asia. And it will never we'll never go back to the opposite, particularly with what we're currently doing. And so the surprising things are more for me as on the US side of strategically how do we think about these things and how do we forecast out 5 10 15 20 years is that even if that was a consideration, it really wasn't given much credence. Those are the things that surprised me more. Of course, a company if they're tariffed is going to go outside and build somewhere else. Of course, companies that have internal intensive competition are going to want to go to new markets where they can make more profits. That's going to happen that's business. But when you actually look at geopolitics and the evolution of geopolitics, particularly in regards to China, if you again, if you try to force China into a situation, you're not going to expect the outcome, right? And the outcome in this particular case of trade war 1.0 is it cemented Chinese influence in Southeast Asia. The outcome of trade war 2.0, although we don't know it, is essentially now cementing China's lead in supply chains in Asia, Africa, and Europe.</p>

主持人 Jill: 当它在拉丁美洲，当它在我们的半球时，我们这个国家会真的吓坏的。而且它

<details>

<p class="english-text">We're going to get really freaked out in this country when it's LAM when it's like in our hemisphere. And it's</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 他们已经吓坏了。我的意思是，现实是，当你与中国企业，特别是中国以外的私营企业交谈时，他们知道他们必须遵守当地规则。所以最让我惊讶的一件事是，美国没有鼓励更多的中国企业，特别是在我们必须拥有电池等技术的行业中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">they're already being freaked out. And I mean, the reality is that when you talk to Chinese businesses, particularly private businesses outside of China, they know that they have to abide by local rules. And so one of the things that has been most surprising to me is that the US doesn't encourage more Chinese firms particularly in industries where we have to have the technology battery and so on.</p>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 一个美国人必须负责所有数据隔离，你知道，有些事情你可以做，那是唾手可得的成果。我经常使用的一个论点是，例如，对于这些先进的供应链，例如电动汽车，中国企业在过去20年里投入了数千亿美元来发展它，为什么美国或欧洲要花同样的钱？这很愚蠢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">an American has to be in charge all data silo you know there are certain things you can do that are low hanging fruit and one of the arguments that I use often is for example with these advanced supply chains for example with EVs China Chinese firms China has invested hundreds of billions of dollars in the last 20 years developing this out why does the US or Europe want to spend the same it's stupid</p>
</details>

嘉宾 Cameron Johnson: 如果你想把它发展起来，就邀请他们来做，支付他们特许权使用费，无论最终是多少。获取技术，然后分叉并使其本土化。所以，不是落后20年、10年，现在你只落后两年。这是一个非常不同的对话。而这些事情，Tracy，我们只是没有看到我们没有利用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">if you want to build it out invite them to do it pay them the royalty fee, whatever it comes out to. Take the technology and then fork it and make it indigenous. So instead of 20, 10 years, 20 years behind, now you're two. That's a much different conversation. And these are things to your point, Tracy, that we just don't see whether we're not taking advantage.</p>

### 总结与反思

主持人 Jill: 嗯，这确实是一次非常引人入胜的对话。我的意思是，有很多值得深思的地方。中国在人工智能方面领先，而且差距不小，这个观点非常有趣。是的，这是一个有趣的论点，因为我认为在美国，人们谈论人工智能的方式是，这仍然是一个我们保持某种“领先”的领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, that was certainly a very fascinating conversation. I mean, there's a lot to pick up from. This idea that China is ahead in AI and that it's not particularly close is like a really interesting contention. Yes, it's an interesting contention because I think here in the US the way people talk about AI is that this is still an area where we maintain some semblance of a quote lead unquote.</p>
</details>

主持人 Tracy: 是的。我也认为，嗯，我想强调中国公司这种迭代过程的重要性，因为中国确实有这种背景，即获取特定的技术或做事方式，然后对其进行改进。所以看起来人工智能可能只是加速了这一点，或者人工智能本身就是一个可以部署这种策略的地方。我还在想的另一件事是

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I also thought well I guess the emphasis on the sort of like iterative process of Chinese companies was important because China does have this like background of taking a particular piece of technology or a way of doing things and then improving on it. So it seems like maybe AI just kind of speeds that up or maybe AI itself is a place where it can kind of deploy that strategy. The other thing I was thinking about is</p>
</details>

主持人 Tracy: Cameron强调的供应链网络的重要性，以及复制它的难度。比如你能想象

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">just the importance of the supply network that Cameron was emphasizing and how difficult it is to replicate that. Like could you imagine</p>

主持人 Jill: 美国有一个圣诞村吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">a Christmas village in the US?</p>
</details>

主持人 Tracy: 不。或者一个鞋城，一个城镇，所有这些东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No. And or a shoe town and town and all of these things.</p>
</details>

主持人 Jill: 不。这几乎是无法想象的。你知道，我认为这是我们和Impulse Labs的Sam Demiko谈论过的事情。你知道，供应链就是产品，对吧？我认为听他谈论产能过剩，并不是指最终产品的产能过剩本身。而是指这种产能过剩，如果它是一个有意义的视角，它涵盖了整个链条，对吧？以及所有不同的供应商。我认为这是一个非常有趣的想法。你知道，我认为另一个重要的事情，听起来很微不足道，但抛开劳动力成本不谈，直到我们拥有完美的人形机器人，人口是无可替代的，对吧？所以仅仅是工人的数量，无论是潜在的工厂工人还是STEM（Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics: 科学、技术、工程、数学）毕业生的数量，在某种程度上可能与教育优先级有关，但在另一种程度上也仅仅与世界上的人口数量有关。这最终会产生有意义的质的差异。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No. It's almost impossible to imagine. You know, I think this is something we've talked about Sam Demiko of Impulse Labs. You know, the idea that the supply chain is the product, right? And I think hearing him talk about over capacity as in it's not about the cap over capacity of end products per se. It's about that over capacity to the extent that that is a meaningful lens of the entire the entire chain, right? And all the different suppliers. I thought that was like a really interesting idea. You know, another thing that I think is important and it sounds trivial, but setting aside the cost of labor until we have perfect humanoid robotics, there is no substitute for population, right? And so just the fact that the sheer number of workers, whether we're talking potentially factory workers or the sheer number of STEM graduates, which to some extent might be about educational priorities, but to another extent is also just going to be about the sheer number of people in the world. It ends up being a meaningful qualitative difference.</p>
