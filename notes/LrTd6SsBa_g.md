title: AAA级垃圾债：Tricolor与First Brands破产案揭示信贷市场真实风险
---

### 破产风波：信贷市场尽职调查的盲区

就在**First Brands Group**（一家汽车零部件进口商和分销商）宣布破产的几周前，它还被推销给投资者，被宣传为一个价值60亿美元的贷款机会。Jefferies公司当时正在推销这笔交易，该公司据称拥有近10亿美元现金。然而，它很快就崩溃了——这再次证明，“**尽职调查**”（Due Diligence: 投资前对目标公司进行的全面审查）有时只是推介材料中的一个空泛词汇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just weeks before its bankruptcy, First Brands Group was being pitched to investors as a $6 billion loan opportunity. Jefferies was marketing the deal. The company was said to have nearly $1 billion in cash. Then it imploded - proof, once again, that “due diligence” is sometimes just a phrase in a pitch deck.</p>
</details>

**Tricolor Holdings**（一家二手车经销商兼次级贷款机构）的倒闭速度更快。Tricolor既经营二手车经销业务，又是**次级贷款**（Subprime Loan: 发放给信用记录有限或没有信用记录的借款人的高风险贷款）机构，向信用记录有限或没有信用记录的借款人（其中许多是无证移民）提供高利率贷款。它将这些贷款打包成AAA级**证券**（Securities: 代表所有权、债务或权利的金融工具）并出售给投资者。当还款出现问题时，整个结构就瓦解了。其债权人之一**Fifth Third Bank**（第五三银行）指控Tricolor欺诈，声称该公司将同一抵押品质押给多个债权人。调查人员目前正在梳理一个可能已被篡改的贷款数据库，各银行已开始从美国西南部的经销商处收回车辆。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tricolor Holdings collapsed even faster. Tricolor operated as both a used car dealership and a subprime lender, offering high-interest loans to borrowers with limited or no credit history—many of them undocumented. It packaged those loans into AAA-rated securities and sold them to investors. When repayments faltered, the whole structure unraveled. Fifth Third Bank, one of its creditors, is accusing Tricolor of fraud, alleging that the company pledged the same collateral to multiple creditors. Investigators are now combing through what may be a corrupted loan database, and banks have begun repossessing vehicles from dealership lots across the Southwest.</p>
</details>

### 市场震荡：机构投资者面临意外损失

这些公司迅速倒闭的速度令投资者措手不及。就在几个月前，**First Brands**的债务还被**私有信贷基金**（Private Credit Funds: 向企业提供直接贷款的非银行机构）以接近面值的价格估值，有些甚至超过面值100美分。**Tricolor**的AAA级证券在破产前也以全价交易。如今，**First Brands**的顶级贷款仅值每美元33美分多一点，而**Tricolor**的低级别债券已暴跌至每美元12美分。这些本不应是疯狂的投资，它们存在于养老基金、保险公司和资产管理公司等机构的投资组合中，这些机构的目标是避免波动，而非承受波动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The speed of these collapses caught investors off guard. Just months ago, First Brands’ debt was marked near par by private credit funds—some even marked above 100 cents on the dollar. Tricolor’s AAA-rated securities were trading at full value before the bankruptcy. Today, First Brands’ top-tier loans fetch just over 33 cents on the dollar and Tricolor’s lower-ranking bonds have plunged to 12 cents on the dollar. These weren’t supposed to be crazy investments. They sat in the portfolios of pension funds, insurers, and asset managers—institutions that aim to avoid volatility, not absorb it.</p>
</details>

**Kroll**（一家债券评级机构）将部分**Tricolor**债券的评级从AAA级（19个级别）下调至双C级。据**Bloomberg**（彭博社）报道，该评级机构未能联系上**Tricolor**，甚至无法确认其业务的基本事实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kroll – a bond rating agency cut its bond rating on some Tricolor bonds from AAA - 19 levels to double C. According to Bloomberg - the rating agency wasn’t able to contact Tricolor and couldn’t confirm even basic facts about the business.</p>
</details>

这些违约事件暴露了信贷市场的弱点，导致投资者质疑贷款标准和**私有债务市场**（Private Debt Markets: 非公开交易的债务工具市场）的结构。它们也引发了关于所谓安全证券中隐藏了多少风险，以及是否有更多意外正在酝酿中的疑问。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">These defaults have exposed weaknesses in the credit markets, are leading investors to question lending standards, and the structure of private debt markets. They’ve also raised questions about how much risk is hiding in supposedly safe securities—and whether more surprises are waiting in the wings.</p>
</details>

**First Brands**倒闭时，暴露出一个120亿美元的负债网络，调查人员正在努力揭示该公司是否多次将同一资产质押给不同的贷款人，以借入巨额资金。投资银行**Jefferies**和全球最大的对冲基金之一**Millennium Management**（千禧管理）据说都面临损失。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First Brands revealed a twelve-billion-dollar web of liabilities when it collapsed - and investigators are working to unveil whether the firm pledged the same assets to different lenders several times over – in order to borrow these huge sums of money. Jefferies - the investment bank, and Millennium Management – one of the biggest hedge funds in the world, are said to be amongst those facing losses.</p>
</details>

### 公司业务模式与潜在压力

**Tricolor**和**First Brands**在汽车行业的不同领域运营。**Tricolor**向次级借款人出售二手车，其中许多是美国西南部的无证劳工。**First Brands**进口和分销刹车片、火花塞和雨刮器等汽车零部件，销售给**AutoZone**和**O’Reilly**等主要零售商。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tricolor and First Brands operated in different corners of the auto sector. Tricolor sold used cars to subprime borrowers, many of whom were undocumented workers in the Southwestern United States. First Brands imported and distributed car parts—things like brake pads, spark plugs and windshield wipers—which were sold to major retailers like AutoZone and O’Reilly.</p>
</details>

这两家公司都是私营企业，都严重依赖债务。**Tricolor**像许多经销商一样，从向客户提供的贷款中获得的收益多于汽车本身。据**Bloomberg**报道，他们经常收取超过20%的利率。这些贷款被打包成**资产支持证券**（Asset-Backed Securities, ABS: 以资产池为抵押发行的证券）并出售给投资者。**First Brands**通过收购建立起来，这些收购是通过借款融资的。其所有者**Patrick James**通过整合小型制造商来扩大公司，然后通过以发票和库存作抵押进一步增加杠杆，利用**私有信贷基金**和专业贷款机构。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Both companies were privately owned and both relied heavily on debt. Tricolor – Like many dealerships, earned more from the loans it made to its customers than from the cars themselves. According to Bloomberg – they regularly charged interest rates above 20%. Those loans were bundled into asset-backed securities and sold-on to investors. First Brands was built up through acquisitions – which were financed by borrowing. Its owner, Patrick James, expanded the company by stitching together smaller manufacturers - he then layered on further leverage by borrowing against invoices and inventory—tapping private credit funds and specialist lenders.</p>
</details>

他们的商业模式并非天生有缺陷。**Tricolor**服务于一个难以获得传统信贷的利基市场。**First Brands**通过收购和供应链金融实现了规模扩张。但两家公司都面临着近年来日益加剧的压力：移民执法、关税上涨、通货膨胀，以及因高利率和高昂车价而捉襟见肘的消费群体。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Their business models weren’t inherently flawed. Tricolor served a niche market with limited access to traditional credit. First Brands built scale through acquisitions and supply chain finance. But each was exposed to pressures that have intensified in recent years: immigration enforcement, rising tariffs, inflation, and a consumer base stretched by higher interest rates and elevated vehicle costs.</p>
</details>

**First Brands**的两家客户**AutoZone**和**O’Reilly Autoparts**持续报告强劲收益。这使得**First Brands**的倒闭更加引人注目。问题不在于需求，而在于公司的融资结构。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">AutoZone and O’Reilly autoparts – two customers of First Brands - have continued to report strong earnings. This makes First Brands’ collapse even more striking. The problem wasn’t demand—it was the structure of the company’s financing.</p>
</details>

### 消费经济分化与次级贷款风险

美国最大的二手车零售商**CarMax**上周的盈利未达预期，跌幅超过37%，导致其股价跌至五年来的最低点。单位销售额大幅下降，管理层称该季度“充满挑战”，理由是消费者需求疲软和定价失误。**CarMax**主要服务于中等收入买家。如果这个群体正在削减开支，这可能预示着更广泛的消费支出正面临压力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">CarMax, the country’s largest used car retailer, missed earnings expectations by more than 37% last week, sending its stock to a five-year low. Unit sales fell sharply, and management described the quarter as “challenging,” citing weaker consumer demand and pricing missteps. Carmax caters to middle-income buyers. If this group are cutting their spending, it might be a sign that broader spending is under pressure.</p>
</details>

美国消费经济似乎正在分化——我们最近在我的视频“**The Great Mortgage Divide**”（巨大的抵押贷款鸿沟）中讨论过这个观点。富裕的美国人感觉相当富有，许多人在疫情前以低利率贷款购买了房屋，现在房价已大幅上涨。这个群体在投资方面也表现良好，股市接近历史高点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The US consumer economy appears to be splitting – we discussed this idea recently in my video on the great Mortgage divide. Wealthier American households are feeling quite rich, many bought homes before the pandemic with low-interest rate loans and house prices are now up significantly. This group are also up on their investments – with the stock market sitting near all-time highs.</p>
</details>

另一方面，较贫困的家庭则落后了。持续不退的通货膨胀推高了日常必需品的成本。贫困美国人的贷款利率很高，而二手车价格等商品，尽管已脱离峰值，但仍高于疫情前水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Poorer households – on the other hand - are falling behind. Inflation – which refuses to go away - has pushed up the cost of everyday essentials. Interest rates on poorer Americans loans are high and things like used car prices, though off their peak, are still high relative to pre-pandemic levels.</p>
</details>

其他开支，如保险费和汽车维修成本——这些在低收入美国人的支出中占比较大——也超过了总体通胀。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Other expenses like insurance premiums and car maintenance costs – which make up a larger percentage of low-income Americans spending - have outpaced headline inflation too.</p>
</details>

虽然目前**优质汽车贷款**（Prime Auto Loans: 发放给信用记录良好借款人的低风险汽车贷款）看起来没问题，但据**Fitch**（惠誉评级）称，6.6%的次级汽车贷款逾期至少60天——这是该机构开始收集数据以来的最高水平。信用卡违约和学生贷款违约也大幅上升。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">While prime auto loans seem fine – at present – according to Fitch - 6.6% of subprime auto loans are at least 60 days past due – this is the highest level seen - since the agency began collecting data on them. Credit card defaults and student loan defaults have risen sharply too.</p>
</details>

**Tricolor**的倒闭反映了其中的一些压力。该公司专门向难以获得传统信贷的借款人提供贷款——其中许多是靠工资维持生计的无证劳工。一些分析师指出，移民执法是促成因素之一。对驱逐出境的担忧和劳动力流失可能扰乱了还款模式，尽管影响程度仍不清楚。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tricolor’s collapse reflects some of this pressure. The company specialized in lending to borrowers with limited access to traditional credit—many were undocumented workers who live paycheck to paycheck. Some analysts have pointed to immigration enforcement as a contributing factor. Deportation fears and labor force exits may have disrupted repayment patterns, though the extent of the impact remains unclear.</p>
</details>

**First Brands**也间接暴露在类似的消费群体中。其零部件通过面向预算有限的司机的零售商销售。**AutoZone**和**O’Reilly**报告了强劲的收益，表明汽车零部件需求依然旺盛。在这种情况下，问题可能不是客户群，而是业务的资本结构。**First Brands**曾大量借款用于收购，然后又以发票和库存作抵押再次借款。关税上涨进一步加剧了其商业模式的压力，增加了进口零部件的成本并挤压了利润。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First Brands was exposed to a similar consumer base, but indirectly. Its parts were sold through retailers that cater to budget-conscious drivers. AutoZone and O’Reilly have reported strong earnings, suggesting auto part demand remains intact. The problem in this case may not have been the customer base— it appears instead to have been the capital structure of the business. First Brands had borrowed heavily to fund acquisitions, then borrowed again against invoices and inventory. Rising tariffs added further strain to their business model, increasing costs on imported components and squeezing margins.</p>
</details>

### 商业部门的普遍疲软迹象

商业部门也出现了其他普遍疲软的迹象。半挂卡车的销量——这可以向投资者表明企业对未来几个月和几年业务繁忙程度的预期——自2023年5月以来下降了24%，达到五年来的最低水平。中型卡车的销量也下降了近30%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There are other signs of general weaknesses in the business sector too. Sales of semi-trucks – which can indicate to investors how busy businesses expect to be in the coming months and years - have fallen 24% since May 2023, to the lowest level seen in five years. Medium duty truck sales are down almost 30% too.</p>
</details>

劳动力市场数据又增加了一层不确定性。**ADP**（一家全球人力资本管理解决方案提供商）的私人就业报告显示，最近一个时期减少了3.2万个工作岗位。这个数字可能不准确，但由于美国政府停摆，**Bureau of Labor Statistics**（劳工统计局）已暂停报告，所以这是我们目前唯一的数据。失业率作为领先指标和触发因素都会影响信贷市场，因为显然，当工作岗位消失时，还款风险就会上升。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Labor market data adds another layer of uncertainty. ADP’s private payroll report showed a loss of 32,000 jobs in the most recent period. Now this number may not be accurate – but it is all we have right now as The Bureau of Labor Statistics has paused its reporting due to the US government shutdown. Unemployment affects credit markets both as a leading indicator and as a trigger – as obviously - when jobs disappear, repayment risk rises.</p>
</details>

这一切都发生在一个市场风险回报率暴跌的时期。公司债券收益率与同期限国债收益率之间的利差已降至2007年以来的最低水平。**The Economist**（经济学人）本周指出，**垃圾债券**（Junk Bonds: 信用评级较低、风险较高的债券）目前提供的利差仅为2.8%，远低于过去二十年4.5%的平均水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This all comes at a time when the reward for taking risk in markets has collapsed. The spread between yields on corporate bonds and the equivalent expiration treasury bonds has fallen to its lowest level since 2007. The Economist pointed out this week that junk bonds are now offering spreads of just 2.8 percent – which is well below the 4.5-percent average of the last twenty years.</p>
</details>

### 私有信贷市场的崛起与风险

这些公司的倒闭引起了人们对近2万亿美元**私有信贷市场**（Private Credit Market: 由非银行机构直接向企业提供贷款的市场）的关注，该市场推动了华尔街近期的繁荣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The collapse of these companies has drawn attention to the near two trillion-dollar private credit market that has fueled Wall Street’s recent boom.</p>
</details>

**Jim Chanos**（一位以揭露安然公司欺诈而闻名的**卖空者**），他在1990年代后期通过揭露**Enron**（安然公司: 一家曾利用表外融资隐藏巨额亏损的能源公司）的欺诈行为而声名鹊起，昨天告诉**Financial Times**（金融时报），**First Brands Group**的混乱破产可能预示着新一波企业倒闭潮。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The short seller Jim Chanos who earned his reputation from exposing fraud at Enron in the late 1990’s – a firm that used off-balance sheet financing to hide substantial losses - told the Financial Times yesterday that First Brands Group’s chaotic bankruptcy could augur a new wave of corporate collapses.</p>
</details>

政策制定者在过去十年中一直致力于将风险从银行转移到非银行贷款机构。这一策略降低了系统性风险敞口，但也使得追踪经济压力积聚的地点变得更加困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Policymakers have spent the past decade shifting risk away from banks and into the hands of non-bank lenders. That strategy will have reduced systemic exposure, but it‘s also made it harder to track where the pressure in the economy is building.</p>
</details>

全球金融危机后，面对更严格的监管，银行退出了风险较高的贷款业务，**私有信贷**随之膨胀；这些新的私有贷款机构试图在不透明的市场中获取高回报，并愿意承担随之而来的风险。这导致了异常复杂的金融安排，其中许多超出了监管机构甚至参与机构的视野。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Private credit ballooned when banks – faced with higher regulation - withdrew from riskier lending the wake of the global financial crisis; these new – private lenders sought to capture high returns in opaque markets, and were willing to put up with the risk doing so entailed. This has led to extraordinarily complex financial arrangements, many beyond the sight of regulators and even the institutions involved.</p>
</details>

**私有信贷**本应更智能。贷款机构编写定制合同，为每个借款人量身定制。他们避免公开披露，规避**按市值计价**（Mark-to-Market: 资产或负债按其当前市场价值进行估值）的波动性，并在双边关系中运作，承诺在经济下行时保持灵活性。这种模式被宣传为比银行贷款更安全，比公共债务市场更具纪律性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Private credit was supposed to be smarter. Lenders wrote bespoke contracts, tailored to each borrower. They avoided public disclosures, sidestepped mark-to-market volatility, and operated in bilateral relationships that promised flexibility in a downturn. The model was pitched as safer than bank lending and more disciplined than public debt markets.</p>
</details>

**First Brands**的案例展示了这种模式如何崩溃。该公司有多层融资——有些是银团贷款，有些是私有贷款，有些是**表外融资**（Off-Balance Sheet Financing: 不在资产负债表上列示的融资方式）。贷款机构对整体资本结构没有全面的了解。有些可能认为他们持有高级债权，结果却发现他们暴露在被多次质押的抵押品风险中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First Brands shows how that model can break. The company had multiple layers of financing—some syndicated, some private, some off-balance sheet. Lenders didn’t have a full picture of the overall capital structure. Some may have thought they held senior claims, only to discover they were exposed to collateral that had been pledged more than once.</p>
</details>

### 华尔街的连锁反应与审计质疑

**First Brands**和**Tricolor**倒闭的余波已深入华尔街，**Financial Times**对此撰写了一篇关于赢家和输家的精彩文章。**Jefferies**在**First Brands**倒闭前几周还在推销其债务，现在面临声誉受损。其投资部门也暴露在该公司的发票融资中——这种安排可能没有充分披露给其他贷款人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The fallout from First Brands and Tricolor has reached deep into Wall Street and the FT wrote an excellent piece on the winners and losers. Jefferies, which had been marketing First Brands’ debt just weeks before the collapse, now faces reputational damage. Its investment unit was also exposed to the company’s invoice financing—an arrangement that may not have been adequately disclosed to other lenders.</p>
</details>

全球最大的对冲基金之一**Millennium Management**是面临损失的机构之一。包括**PGIM**和**CIFC**在内的其他资产管理公司通过**抵押贷款债务**（Collateralized Loan Obligations, CLOs: 一种将各类贷款打包成证券出售的金融产品）持有**First Brands**的债务。其中一些**CLO**以接近面值的价格购买了这些债务，现在其交易价格仅为每美元33美分多一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Millennium Management, one of the world’s largest hedge funds, is among those facing losses. Other asset managers, including PGIM and CIFC, held First Brands debt through collateralized loan obligations. Some of these CLOs bought the debt near face value. It now trades at just over 33 cents on the dollar.</p>
</details>

**Tricolor**的倒闭直接打击了银行。**JPMorgan**（摩根大通）、**Barclays**（巴克莱银行）和**Fifth Third**向该公司提供了**仓储信贷额度**（Warehouse Lines of Credit: 银行向贷款机构提供的短期融资，用于持有贷款直至其被证券化），期望在汽车贷款证券化后获得偿还。然而，这笔偿还从未到来。**Fifth Third**指控**Tricolor**欺诈，声称该公司将同一抵押品质押给多个贷款人。该银行已发出2亿美元减值警告。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tricolor’s collapse has hit banks directly. JPMorgan, Barclays, and Fifth Third provided warehouse lines of credit to the company, expecting to be repaid once the auto loans were securitized. That repayment never came. Fifth Third has accused Tricolor of fraud, alleging the company pledged the same collateral to multiple lenders. The bank has warned of a $200 million impairment.</p>
</details>

债券持有人现在正争相保护自己的债权。**Clear Haven Capital**一直在联系其他投资者，敦促他们协调法律策略。据报道，位于达拉斯的银行**Triumph Financial**派员工前往**Tricolor**经销商处，收回被质押为抵押品的车辆。新闻报道并未明确他们是派律师还是拖车司机，可能两者都需要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Bondholders are now scrambling to protect their claims. Clear Haven Capital has been calling other investors, urging them to coordinate legal strategies. Triumph Financial – a Dallas based bank - reportedly sent employees to Tricolor dealerships to repossess vehicles that were pledged as collateral. It’s unclear – based on the news reports if they sent lawyers or tow trucks drivers. Possibly both – you would probably need both…</p>
</details>

审计师也受到审查。**BDO**在今年早些时候给了**First Brands**一份干净的审计报告，但该公司在几个月后就倒闭了，暴露出一个120亿美元的负债网络。**Deloitte**（德勤）受聘制作一份**盈利质量报告**（Quality-of-Earnings Report: 评估公司报告盈利可持续性和真实性的报告），但破产事件抢先一步。时机一如既往地重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Auditors are also coming under scrutiny. BDO gave First Brands a clean audit earlier this year and the company collapsed just months later, revealing a $12 billion web of liabilities. Deloitte was hired to produce a quality-of-earnings report, but the bankruptcy beat them to it. Timing, as ever, is everything.</p>
</details>

一些投资者预见到了麻烦。**Apollo Global Management**和**Diameter Capital**在**First Brands**倒闭前卖空了其债务。另一些投资者则在事后介入，以大幅折扣购买了不良贷款。**Goldman Sachs**（高盛）报告称，**First Brands**近10亿美元的债务在一天之内易手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some investors saw the trouble coming. Apollo Global Management and Diameter Capital shorted First Brands debt before the collapse. Others moved in after the fact, buying distressed loans at steep discounts. Goldman Sachs reported that nearly $1 billion of First Brands debt changed hands in a single day.</p>
</details>

### 私有信贷与银行系统的隐秘联系

**私有信贷**常被描述为独立于银行系统之外。这并不完全正确。非银行贷款机构——**私有信贷基金**、对冲基金、专业金融公司——都从银行借款。它们依赖于**循环信贷额度**（Revolving Credit Lines: 可重复使用的信贷额度）、**仓储融资**（Warehouse Facilities: 银行向贷款机构提供的短期融资，用于持有贷款直至其被证券化）和**过桥贷款**（Bridge Loans: 短期过渡性贷款）。这些安排不会出现在公开文件中，但它们很重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Private credit is often described as being outside the banking system. That’s not quite true. Non-bank lenders—private credit funds, hedge funds, specialist finance firms—borrow from banks. They rely on revolving credit lines, warehouse facilities, and bridge loans. These arrangements don’t show up in public filings, but they matter.</p>
</details>

银行对**非银行金融机构**（Non-Bank Financial Institutions, NBFIs: 不持有银行牌照但从事金融服务的机构）的贷款激增。今年银行贷款的所有增长都来自这一领域。据报道，一家区域性银行向**影子贷款机构**（Shadow Lenders: 提供信贷但不受传统银行监管的机构）提供了620亿美元的贷款，约占其贷款总额的五分之一。其中大部分被归类为“商业”、“私募股权”或“其他”，这在金融术语中意味着“别问”。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Bank lending to non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) has surged. It now accounts for all of the growth in bank lending this year. One regional bank reportedly has $62 billion in loans to shadow lenders—roughly a fifth of its loan book. Most of it is categorized as “business,” “private equity,” or “other.” which is finance-speak for “don’t ask.”</p>

风险不仅在于这些贷款机构可能倒闭，还在于它们可能在最糟糕的时机提取信贷额度。一家面临压力的非银行金融机构最有可能在其抵押品价值下跌时动用银行信贷。这就是银行家所说的“**逆向风险**”（Wrong-Way Risk: 借款人信用风险与抵押品价值之间存在负相关关系的风险）。

<p class="english-text">The risk isn’t just that these lenders might fail. It’s that they might draw down their credit lines at the worst possible moment. A non-bank financial institution under pressure is most likely to tap its bank credit just as the value of its collateral is falling. That’s what bankers call “wrong-way risk.”</p>

监管机构可以看到风险敞口，但投资者看不到。季度报告没有以有用的方式细分**非银行金融机构**贷款。这个系统在设计上就是不透明的。这种不透明性正是其脆弱性的一部分。

<p class="english-text">Regulators can see the exposures, but investors can’t. Quarterly filings don’t break out NBFI lending in useful ways. The system is opaque by design. That opacity is part of what makes it fragile.</p>

### 市场情绪与未来展望

华尔街似乎并未受到影响。就在**First Brands**倒闭几天后，**Electronic Arts**（一家收入平稳的成熟游戏公司）的**杠杆收购**（Leveraged Buyout, LBO: 通过大量借贷来收购一家公司的交易）宣布。如果市场存在恐惧，那它戴着降噪耳机。这笔价值550亿美元的交易是历史上最大的杠杆收购，在美元价值上超过了2007年**TXU**（一家德克萨斯州公用事业集团，后来申请破产）450亿美元的收购案。这笔交易包括200亿美元的债务，被**Financial Times**描述为“一场巨大的赌注，认为人工智能可以显著削减公司的运营成本，从而让股权投资者能够管理一家历史上净债务有限的公司的巨额债务负担。”如果**私有信贷市场**存在恐惧，它并没有体现在交易流中。

<p class="english-text">Wall Street doesn’t seem rattled. The leveraged buyout of Electronic Arts—a mature gaming company with flat revenue—was announced just days after First Brands collapsed. If there’s fear in the market, it’s wearing noise-cancelling headphones. The deal, valued at $55 billion dollars, is the biggest leveraged buyout in history - topping in dollar value the $45bn buyout of Texas utility group TXU in 2007- which later filed for bankruptcy. The deal includes twenty billion dollars in debt and is described by the FT as “a huge bet that AI can significantly cut the companies operating costs, allowing the equity investors to manage a large debt load on a company that historically carried limited net debt. If there’s fear in the private credit market, it’s not showing up in the deal flow.</p>

没有危机的迹象，但也没有真正的谨慎迹象。

<p class="english-text">There’s no sign of a crisis - but there’s no real sign of caution either.</p>
</details>

关于**First Brands**最深刻的调查并非来自评级机构或投资者推介材料，而是来自**Financial Times**的**Robert Smith**。**Smith**和他的团队通过查阅法院记录，揭露了该公司创始人**Patrick James**此前的欺诈指控——这似乎是许多贷款机构未能完成的工作。**Smith**发现的案件源于2008年金融危机期间的损失，涉及数百万美元，而非数十亿美元。这些案件已和解，而非撤销。

<details>

<p class="english-text">The most revealing work on First Brands didn’t come from rating agencies or investor decks. It came from Robert Smith at the Financial Times. Smith and his team uncovered prior fraud allegations against Patrick James, the company’s founder by digging through court records—work that – it would appear - many lenders failed to do. The cases Smith found came out of losses during the financial crisis in 2008 and were for millions of dollars – not billions. These cases were settled - not dismissed.</p>
</details>

**Smith**多年来一直报道信贷市场，并曾撰写过许多丑闻。他识别出了警告信号：关联方复杂性、表外债务以及贷款机构不了解其他贷款机构在做什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Smith has spent years covering credit markets and has written about numerous scandals in the past. He recognized the warning signs: related-party complexity, off-balance-sheet debt, and lenders unaware of what other lenders were doing.</p>
</details>

**Financial Times**对**First Brands**的报道是基于公共记录和财务报表。**Smith**在**LinkedIn**（领英）上指出，所有**保理费用**（Factoring Expenses: 将应收账款出售给第三方以获取即时现金的费用）都已披露。利差是可见的。一些投资者看到了问题并选择退出。另一些则不屑一顾。**Smith**的报道填补了投资者**尽职调查**本应涵盖的空白。

<p class="english-text">The FT’s coverage of First Brands was built on public records and financial statements. Smith has pointed out on LinkedIn that all of the factoring expenses were disclosed. The spreads were visible. Some investors saw the problem and walked away. Others didn’t bother to look. Smith’s reporting filled a gap that investor due diligence should have covered.</p>

信贷市场并非正在崩溃，但它们也没有真正补偿投资者所承担的风险。

<p class="english-text">Credit markets aren’t exactly melting down. But they are not really compensating investors for the risks they’re taking either.</p>
</details>

**First Brands**和**Tricolor**不具有系统重要性，它们的失败并未引发恐慌。但它们可能揭示了信贷市场某些角落的脆弱程度，尤其是在不透明性与杠杆相遇的地方。这些并非投机交易者持有的奇异工具，它们是AAA级证券，有抵押品支持，出售给重视稳定性的机构。

<details>

<p class="english-text">First Brands and Tricolor are not systemically important, and their failures didn’t trigger panic. But they possibly reveal how fragile some corners of the credit market have become, especially where opacity meets leverage. These weren’t exotic instruments held by speculative traders. They were AAA-rated securities, backed by collateral, sold to institutions that prize stability.</p>
</details>

自全球金融危机以来，风险结构发生了很大变化。如今，大部分次级债务和公司债务都由投资经理、保险公司和养老基金持有——这些实体由长期负债提供资金。这与曾经支撑上次危机的**资产支持商业票据**（Asset-Backed Commercial Paper: 以资产为抵押发行的短期票据）和银行存款相去甚远。但融资模式并非唯一值得关注的变量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The structure of risk has changed a lot since the global financial crisis. Much of today’s subprime and corporate debt sits with investment managers, insurers, and pension funds—entities funded by longer-term liabilities. That’s a far cry from the asset-backed commercial paper and bank deposits that once underpinned the last crisis. But the funding model isn’t the only variable worth watching.</p>
</details>

**私有信贷**增长迅速，其对银行融资的依赖也随之增加。**Robert Armstrong**在最近的**Financial Times**专栏中指出，**影子银行**目前占据了今年美国银行贷款的所有增长。他指出，**影子银行**贷款已达1.7万亿美元，占银行贷款总额的13%，在最大的机构中占比更高。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Private credit has grown rapidly and so has its reliance on bank financing. Robert Armstrong pointed out in a recent FT column that shadow banks now account for all of the growth in U.S. bank lending this year. At $1.7 trillion dollars – he points out that – Shadow Bank lending now represents 13 percent of total bank loans—and far more at the largest institutions.</p>
</details>

市场上没有恐慌的迹象——除了美元今年迄今下跌约10%。信贷利差收紧，股市活跃，历史上最大的杠杆收购案在**First Brands**倒闭几天后宣布。如果投资者担心，他们肯定没有表现出来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There’s no sign of fear in markets – other than the dollar being down about 10% year to date. Credit spreads are tight. Equity markets are buoyant and the largest leveraged buyout in history was announced – just days after First Brands collapsed. If investors are worried, they’re certainly not showing it.</p>
</details>

但问题不在于市场是否会崩溃，而在于投资者是否获得了足够的补偿来承担他们正在承担的风险。当利差微薄且结构不透明时，即使是一个稳定的系统也可能产生令人不快的意外。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the question isn’t whether the market will unravel. It’s whether investors are being adequately compensated to take the risks they’re assuming. When spreads are thin and structures are opaque, even a stable system can produce nasty surprises.</p>

### 轻松一刻：说唱新闻与狱中奇闻

评论区有些人说这个频道偏离了其既定的说唱新闻重点——**Ted**，你可以忘记冰茶和史酷比狗了。在**说唱新闻**中，**Bloomberg**本周报道称，一位加拿大对冲基金经理和**Meme股**（Meme Stocks: 因社交媒体关注而股价大幅波动的股票）投资者一直在多伦多说唱歌手**Drake**的房子外面站着，试图说服**Drake**对某只股票发表看法。许多人认为加拿大监管机构应该打击这种行为——如果它真的有效的话——其他加拿大投资者，比如**The Plain Bagel**，可能会开始骚扰**Barenaked Ladies**（一个加拿大乐队）为**Berkshire Hathaway**（伯克希尔哈撒韦）写一首歌。谁知道这一切将如何收场。

<p class="english-text">Some people in the comments have been saying that this channel has drifted from its stated focus on rap news – [Ted] you can forget about icey tea and scoopy scoopy dog dog. In Rap News - Bloomberg reported this week that a Canadian Hedge fund manager and meme stock investor has been standing outside the rapper Drakes House in Toronto - trying to convince Drake to say something about some stock. Many are arguing that Canadian regulators should crack down on this sort of thing - as if it actually works out – Other Canadian investors like The Plain Bagel – are likely to start harassing the Barenaked Ladies to write a song about Berkshire Hathaway. Who knows where this could all end.</p>

另据报道，**Financial Times**称，一名被定罪的中国诈骗犯**郭文贵**（又名**Ho Wan Kwok**），正在与**Sean John Combs**（又名**Diddy**、**Puff Daddy**、**Puffy**、**P Diddy**、**Brother Love**和**Frank Black**，请勿与**Pixies**乐队的**Black Francis**混淆）一起服刑，并在狱中教授一门名为“与**Diddy**一起玩转免费游戏”的自助课程。**郭文贵**形容**Sean John Combs**（拥有各种别名）非常有条理，他还表示，他和**Sean John Combs**讨论过在出狱后共同创建一个人工智能平台——所以我们对此拭目以待。
