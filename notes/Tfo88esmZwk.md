### 欢迎与Aviva首席执行官Amanda Blanc对话

Nicolola Tangen: 大家好，我是**挪威主权财富基金**（Norges Bank Investment Management: 负责管理挪威政府全球养老基金的机构）的首席执行官Nicolola Tangen。今天，我们有幸邀请到**Aviva**（英国领先的保险公司）的首席执行官Amanda Blanc。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hi everybody, I'm Nicolola Tangen, the CEO of the Norwegian Sover and Wealth Fund and in today we are in really good company with Amanda Blanc, the CEO of Britain's leading insurance company, Aviva.</p>
</details>

Nicolola Tangen: Aviva是一家为您的房屋、汽车提供保险，并帮助您储蓄养老金的公司。他们全球服务2500万人，仅在英国就服务2100万人。Amanda于2020年7月上任，并领导了一场被描述为彻底的转型，我们将详细了解这一切。Amanda，非常高兴您能参加我们的节目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now this is the kind of company that ensures your home, your car, and helps you save for retirement. They serve 25 million people globally and 21 million people in the UK alone. Amanda took over in July 2020 and has led what is described as a complete transformation and we're going to hear all about it. Uh so Amanda, wonderful to have you on the broadcast.</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 谢谢Nicolai，很高兴见到你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now thanks Nikolai, really great to see you.</p>
</details>

Nicolola Tangen: 在我们开始之前，能简单介绍一下Aviva主要做什么吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just briefly before we start, what does Aviva actually do in short? All right.</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 简单来说，我们主要保护个人和企业免受可能发生的坏事影响。此外，我们还在人们需要帮助时，以及他们希望退休时提供支持。所以，我们常说“今天与您同行，共创美好明天”，这就是我们的宗旨，我想它概括了我们所做的一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In short, well, I mean, basically, it protects people. It protects businesses um from bad things that can happen. And also, it looks after people in their hour of need and when they want to do things like retire. So, you know, we we say with you today for a better tomorrow. That's our purpose. And I suppose that encapsulates everything that we do.</p>
</details>

### Aviva的双重角色与独特优势

Nicolola Tangen: 你们既是保险公司，又是主要的投资者。您能解释一下这种双重角色吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, you're both an insurer and a major investor. How could you explain that dual role?</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 是的。作为一家保险公司，我们拥有庞大的资产负债表，超过4000亿英镑，因此我们需要将这些资产充分利用起来，我们通过投资来实现这一点。我们是英国的主要投资者，非常看好英国市场，因此我们投资于英国的基础设施、英国国债，也投资于私人资产，以及企业债券和其他领域。我认为这关乎在非常长的时间内为我们的股东和客户获取最佳回报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. So, so obviously um as an insurer we have a big balance sheet so over 400 billion pounds and so we need to put those assets to really really good use and we do that by investing. We're a big investor in the UK so you know we're we're a big believer in the UK so we invest in UK infrastructure in UK guilts I mean also in private assets but we also invest in in corporate debt and and in other things. So I think it's about getting the best return over a very long period for our shareholders and obviously also for our customers.</p>
</details>

Nicolola Tangen: 与其他保险公司相比，Aviva的独特之处在哪里？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When you compare Aviva with other insurance companies, what is it that make you special?</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 嗯，我想对我们来说，是什么让我们与众不同呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think for for us, what makes us special?</p>
</details>

Nicolola Tangen: 当然，除了拥有一位出色的首席执行官之外。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Apart apart, of course, from having a wonderful CEO.</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 哦，不不不。但我认为这确实关乎为Aviva工作的员工。他们带来了巨大的不同。如果你考虑一家保险公司，它并不真正销售像手袋或鞋子那样有形的产品，它基本上销售的是一个支付承诺。所以，我认为这让我们与众不同。但如果我们思考我们的独特卖点（USP），那就是多元化。我们基本上可以从您很小的时候开设**青少年储蓄账户**（Junior ISA: 英国一种免税的儿童储蓄账户），一直到您考虑晚年生活时的**房屋净值抵押贷款**（Equity Release Mortgage: 一种允许房主将房屋净值转换为现金的贷款），以及介于两者之间的一切。在英国，没有其他保险公司能做到这一点，在全球范围内，现在也很少有保险公司能做到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh no, no, no, no. But I I mean I think it is about the people that work for Aviva. They make a really big difference. If you think about an insurance company, it doesn't really sell anything tangible like a handbag or a pair of shoes. It basically sells a promise to pay and so I think you know that that makes us special but really if you think about what's our USP it is being diversified we will basically take you from your junior savings account your junior ISA at a very young age to your equity release mortgage when you know when you're thinking about your later stages of your life and everything in between and there are very very few there are no insurers in the UK that do that and there are very insure few insurers now across the world that do that</p>
</details>

### Aviva的转型与战略决策

Nicolola Tangen: 您和我担任这份工作的时间差不多正好五年。您彻底改变了Aviva，您做出了哪些关键决策？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now you and I we've been in the jobs for pretty much exactly the same time 5 years now you've totally transformed Aviva what are the key decisions that you have made</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 我认为关键决策实际上是在第一个月内做出的。我很幸运地在成为首席执行官之前在董事会任职了六个月。当时最大的决定是关于聚焦投资组合。当我审视Aviva时，我们业务遍布全球，但我们没有形成规模优势。我职业生涯的大部分时间都在与**Claude Bébéar**（AXA前首席执行官，以强调市场领先地位著称）共事，他的一大口头禅是，你必须在所处的市场中位列前三，才能获得影响力并享受规模效益。因此，我们很早就决定聚焦投资组合。我们在最初的12到24个月内出售了八项业务，总计80亿英镑。通过这样做，我们实现了第二个目标，即降低公司杠杆，并向股东返还部分资金。实际上，通过出售那些我们没有规模优势的业务，我们展示了英国、爱尔兰和加拿大核心业务的实力，以及作为市场规模参与者的真正优势开始显现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think the key decisions came with actually within the first month so I was in the fortunate position of being on the board for six months before I became the CEO and really the the big decision was around focusing the portfolio if I looked at Aviva and you know we had positions all across the world but we didn't have scale positions and coming from the background of working at for much of my career working with h onre dcast. You know, one of his big mantras was you you need to be top three in the market that you're in in a in order to be able to influence and to get the benefits of scale in that market. So, we took decisions very early on about focusing the portfolio. We sold eight businesses for8 billion pounds within the first sort of 12 to 24 months and by doing that we were able to meet our second objective which is about delevering the organization also returning some money to shareholders and actually what was good was by by selling off those businesses where we didn't have scale positions we basically showed the strength of the core business in the UK Ireland and Canada and and all you know all the real benefits of being scale players in our market really started to shine M</p>
</details>

Nicolola Tangen: Amanda，在接任首席执行官之前在董事会任职六个月，这真是个奢侈。您当时是不是坐着，拿着一张纸，想着“我要改变这个，我要改变那个”？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amanda, it's quite a luxury to be on the board 6 months before you take over SEO. So, were you sitting there with a piece of paper? It's just like I'm going to change this, I'm going to change that.</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 不，不，完全不是那样。我是在2019年12月开始的，然后我们很快就进入了疫情时期。我们任命了一位新的主席，然后首席执行官辞职了，所以出现了一个真正的机会。当然，当你坐在董事会里，作为一个前高管（我之前做了很长时间的高管），你总是会从“我能做什么不同？”的角度来审视问题。我真的觉得，通过对投资组合做出一些真正果断的决定，对我来说是显而易见的。我骨子里的一切都在告诉我，那是正确的做法。然后你看到了连接所有客户利益的真正机会，当时可能有2000万客户（当时可能没那么多），我觉得这非常有吸引力。但当你无法亲自动手时，总是会感到非常沮丧，不是吗？你总想能够做些什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, I mean, no, it it wasn't like it wasn't like that at all. Um so I started in the December 2019 and um obviously then we went straight into into co and the uh you know we we appointed a new chair and and then you know that the CEO stepped down and so there was a real opportunity and of course as you're sitting on the board you and as a pre and I'd been an executive for a long time before that you're always looking at it with an angle of you know what would I do what could I do differently um and you know I really felt that by making some real decisive decisions around the portfolio that to me was obvious, you know, everything in my DNA was telling me that that was the right thing to do. And then you saw the sort of, you know, 20 20 million customers or probably wasn't as many at that point. The real opportunity to sort of connect all of the benefits through the customer proposition and I felt that that was something really compelling, but yet it was it's always very frustrating, isn't it, when you haven't got your hands on something you want to sort of be able to do.</p>
</details>

Nicolola Tangen: 这次转型中最大的挑战是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What was the biggest challenge in this transformation? Um so I I mean COVID was</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 嗯，我认为新冠疫情是一个巨大的挑战，因为显然，我当时实际上是在运营一个只有我们少数几个人在圣海伦斯老办公楼里做决策，通过Teams电话等方式进行操作。所以这既是福也是祸。困难在于我喜欢深入业务，喜欢了解正在发生的事情，但同时这也意味着你可以真正集中注意力，把事情做好。所以，我认为那是一个挑战。当然，还有组织的文化。你知道，人们习惯了决策过程相当缓慢。所以，我们当时在加快节奏。然后，第三点，坦白说，感谢您成为Aviva的股东。当时是投资者的信心问题。当我与投资者交流时，他们基本上说：“Aviva一直让人非常失望。我们在2010年到2020年之间经历了三次股息削减，我们为什么要投资？有什么不同？”所以，我们真的需要确保能够讲好这个股权故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">a big challenge because obviously you know effectively I was running the operation where there were a few of us in the our old building in St. Helens in in in the city basically you know making making decisions and using teams calls and everything else. So that was a blessing and a curse. I mean it was difficult in that I like to be out in the business. You like to see what's going on but at the same time it also meant you could really focus your attention. You could really get things done. So I think that was a challenge. And then of course there's the culture of the organization. Um you know pe people were used it was quite slow in terms of its decision making. So you know there was sort of you know increasing the pace. Um and then look I think thirdly being absolutely honest and by the way thank you for being a shareholder uh in in Aviva. You know it was it was the investor confidence. You know when I was speaking to investors they were basically saying really you know Aviva's been a big disappointment. um we've sort we've sort of had three dividend cuts between 2010 and 2020 why would we invest you know what you know what's different and so it was really you know m making sure that we were able to tell that equity story</p>
</details>

Nicolola Tangen: 我总觉得在疫情期间做出改变比没有疫情时更容易，因为人们不总是在办公室，他们不能总和所有同事交谈。所以在企业文化方面，我可能觉得改变起来更容易一些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know I I somehow think it's easy it was easier to make change during covid than if co hadn't been there because you know people were not uh in the office all the time they couldn't talk to all their colleagues all the time and so in terms of corporate culture I probably think it was a bit easier to change but</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 嗯，我认为这并非不实。问题在于，如果你喜欢亲自与人坐在一起，倾听他们，了解情况，而我就是这样的人，我就必须找到新的方式来做这件事。比如，跳入Teams电话会议，举办虚拟的全体员工大会，通过这种方式了解组织情况。从某种程度上说，你必须信任一种不同的直觉。所以，我真的认为在决策方面，疫情绝对是有益的，因为你可以真正快速推进事情，特别是如果你考虑出售业务。以前，你可能需要跳上飞机去见人，而现在，你基本上可以通过团队会议，推进工作，达成文件协议，做出决策，这确实更容易。谈到决策，你们以37亿英镑收购了**Direct Line**。为什么这对你们来说很重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well I I I I I don't think that's untrue. I think that the problem was if you're if you like to physically sort of sit with people and listen to them and understand what's going on, which I do. Um I I had to find new ways of doing that. So, you know, jumping into teams calls, doing sort of virtual town halls, getting a sense of the organization that way. In a way, you had to trust a different instinct. So I I do genuinely think that in terms of decision making co was definitely beneficial because you could really just crack through things particularly if you think about selling businesses you know previously you'd have had to jump on planes go and meet people whereas this in this instance you were basically having team meetings moving on getting documents agreed getting decisions taken that was definitely easier. Talking about decisions, you um bought direct line for3.7 billion pounds. Why was that important for you to do?</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 是的。我想，当我们审视我们在英国的市场地位时，我们在大多数产品线上都拥有规模优势。但我们将零售家庭和汽车保险业务的机会视为一项以客户为中心的业务。当我们真正审视Direct Line时，我们真诚地认为我们可以更好地经营这项业务，因为我们拥有规模，有能力投资技术，有能力利用数字化以及我们已经进行的**人工智能**（AI: 模拟人类智能的机器）转型，我们可以重复利用这些。我们认为，通过自己经营这项业务，我们实际上可以为股东带来更好的回报。因此，正如您所料，我们当时也考虑了其他一些替代方案，但费用协同效应、资本协同效应和客户利益的实际优势都汇聚在一起，这真的成了一个无需多想的决定。所以，去年11月、12月，我们提出了收购要约，并于今年7月1日完成了交易。一些保险公司专注于单一产品线，而你们则覆盖了整个范围。这样做有什么优势？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So I think look when we looked at our position in the UK we had scale positions across you know most of our product lines but we looked at the opportunity as a customer focused business for uh in in the retail home and motor book and we really thought actually when we looked at direct line genuinely we felt that we could run that business better because we had scale because we had the ability to invest in technology because we had the ability to use digital and you know the the the AI transformation that we'd already undertaken, we could reuse that. We felt that we actually could deliver a better return for shareholders by running that business um ourselves. And so, you know, as as you would expect, we did look at a number of other alternatives at the time, but the actual benefits of the expense synergies, the capital synergies, and the customer benefits, they sort of all came together and it became a no-brainer really. And so, yeah, last last November, December, um we made the bid and and we completed the deal in the 1 of July this year. M some insurance companies focus in on one product line whilst you cover the whole spectrum. What are the advantages of doing that?</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 我认为在2020年，很多人对我说，单一产品线的业务是未来的方向。他们认为Aviva试图做太多事情，多元化业务不再可行。我对此持非常不同的看法。首先，拥有所有客户数据并贯穿客户生命周期对我来说很重要，但真正重要的是，当您拥有多条业务线时，资本的多元化效益是巨大的。我认为在过去五年中，多元化业务实际上表现更好。如果您考虑投资，例如**生成式人工智能**（Generative AI: 能够生成文本、图像或其他媒体内容的人工智能）带来的投资，能够将其分散到20条产品线而不是只投资于一两条，这绝对会带来巨大的不同。所以，我认为今天人们对多元化业务的看法与五年前可能大不相同了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think in 2020 a lot of people said to me um you know a monoline businesses are the way forward. You know effectively Aviva is trying to do too much diversified businesses you know they they don't work anymore. I I felt very differently from that. You know, for for one thing, having all of the customer data and having the customer through their life cycle felt to me important, but genuinely the diversification benefits for capital are significant when you have various lines of business. And I think what we have seen over the last five years is diversified businesses have actually done better. And if you think about investment, so if we think about the investment that will come with generative AI, you know, being able to spread that across 20 product lines and not just have to invest it in one or two definitely makes a big difference. So you know, I I I I think that people think very differently today about diversified businesses than they did maybe five years ago.</p>
</details>

### 领导力与企业文化

Nicolola Tangen: 您也有在其他保险公司工作的经验，对吗？在Aviva之前，您曾在苏黎世（Zurich）和安盛（AXA）工作过。您从这些公司中学到了什么并带到了Aviva？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now you have experiences from other insurance companies too, right? You've been at Zurich and and AXA before Aviva. What have you taken from those companies into Aviva? So I think I mean you definitely take something from every organization that you work in. I mean</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 我认为你肯定会从你工作的每个组织中学到一些东西。Aviva对我来说情感上比较特殊，因为我实际上是在**Commercial Union**（Aviva的创始公司之一）开始职业生涯的，所以从很多方面来说，我最终又回到了我开始的公司。但我的职业生涯大部分时间（如果按年份计算）是在安盛度过的，分两个不同时期，我从中学到了很多，比如经营全球化、多元化业务的好处。我认为，有机会与我认为最优秀的领导者之一**Claude Bébéar**合作，他确实改变了安盛，使其成为一家真正庞大的公司，然后**Thomas Buberl**（安盛现任首席执行官）又使其不断壮大。但我认为，能够与伟大的领导者合作，了解他们如何让一个组织变得伟大，这对我来说非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">actually aviva is quite an emotional one for me because I actually started in Commercial Union which was a founding company of Aviva. So you know in many respects it's I ended it up in the same company as I started with but I worked for most of my career if if we count it in year terms with AXA you know in two for two different periods and I learned a huge amount from that you know the business the benefit of running a global business a diversified business and I think the opportunity to work with I think what one one one of the best leaders which was on Dash I mean he certainly was he transformed AXA you know he made that into a really huge company and then Thomas has obviously taken it from strength to strength. But I think the ability to work with great leaders to understand, you know, what they do that makes makes an organization great. I think that that was that was really important to me.</p>
</details>

Nicolola Tangen: 保险公司会吸引特定类型的人吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do insurance companies attract a certain type of people.</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 我不这么认为。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't mean that.</p>
</details>

Nicolola Tangen: 我该怎么说呢？嗯，学习**精算学**（Actuarial Sciences: 运用数学和统计方法评估金融风险的学科）的人，他们不像，嗯，怎么说呢？不像摇滚明星那样的人，是吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How should I put it? Uh people who just put it just put it the way you want. I mean people who study actuarial sciences are not are not like what should we say? uh you know uh rock and roll type people are they</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 嗯，我该怎么说呢？首先，我是一名历史学毕业生，所以我想我打破了这种刻板印象。如果我看看我的执行委员会，我们有各种各样拥有不同学位和才能的人。我实际上认为人们不了解保险公司是做什么的。我们一开始就谈到了这一点，但本质上，你可以在市场营销、精算、会计、销售、承保、理赔、供应链等各个领域工作。你知道，一家保险公司几乎无所不包。所以当我出去和学生们谈论保险时，我总是说，这不仅仅是你在电视上看到的汽车保险广告，它远不止于此。当我看到Aviva的员工时，他们来自各种不同的背景和社会阶层，但今天人们对保险真的非常兴奋，Nicolai，我想是因为如果你考虑我们所处的这个世界，数字化和数据，保险公司拥有的数据可能比世界上大多数其他组织都多。如果我们考虑一个人的养老金、房屋保险、汽车保险，然后将所有这些数据连接起来，我们就能吸引真正有才华的数据科学家，以及真正有才华的数字化人才，他们可以将这些数据整合到为客户提供的方案中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well I mean I look so what should I say to that well first of all I'm a history graduate so you know I mean so I think I sort of break break the mold of that and if I look around my exco we've got all sorts of different people from with different degrees talent I actually think that people do not understand what an insurance company does you know we started off by talking about it but in essence you can be in marketing you can you can be an actury you can be an accountant You can be in sales, you can be in underwriting, you can be in claims, you can be in supply chain. You know, literally an insurance company does everything. And so when I'm out talking to school ch school kids about insurance, you know, I say try to say it's not about the motor insurance adverts that you see on TV, there's a huge amount more to it than that. And when I look at the people at Aviva, you know, they are they come from all different backgrounds, different social mobilities, but people are really excited about insurance today. Nikolai, I think because if you think about the world that we're operating in, digital and data, I mean, insurers have more data probably than most other organizations in the world. If we think about, you know, somebody's pension, somebody's home insurance, somebody's car insurance, and then connecting all of that data together, we're able to attract really talented data scientists, and then really talented digital people who can sort of put that together in propositions for customers. But do you</p>
</details>

Nicolola Tangen: 您认为Aviva的员工与苏黎世和安盛的员工更相似，还是与葛兰素史克（GSK）、帝亚吉欧（Diageo）或英国石油（BP）的员工更相似？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">think people in Aviva are more like people at Zurich and AXA than they are uh compared to people in let's say uh GSK, Diardio or BP? Um I don't know. I</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 我不知道。我认为保险肯定是一项不同的业务。你不是在销售实际的实体产品，本质上你没有制造任何东西。所以，我认为你确实会吸引更多，我想，你会看到更多的智力投入，因为你需要很多人深入思考。但我们这里也有很多人对客户充满热情。我认为这与葛兰素史克、英国石油等公司的员工没有什么不同。我们做的事情肯定不同，但实际上，在本质上，人们是相同的，不是吗？他们来工作，希望为客户、为他们所工作的组织做好工作，实际上，有时我认为我们可能会给人们贴上标签，说他们是这种类型或那种类型的人，但实际上，在本质上他们真的不是。他们真的只是想做好工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">mean look I think definitely insurance is a different business. I think you're not selling an actual physical product. So you're not manufacturing anything I in essence. So I think you do attract, you know, there is more, I guess, um, you see, you've got a lot more intellectual power in that, you know, you've got a lot of people that really need really need to think deeply, but we've also got a lot of people here who really care passionately about customers. And I think that's no different to people in GSK and and and and BP and all of those other companies. Definitely the things we do are different, but actually underneath it, people are genuinely the same, aren't they? you know, they come into work, they want to do a great job for their customers, for the organization that they work in, and actually sometimes I think we can sort of label people that they are this type of person or this type of person, but actually they're they're really not underneath it. They really just want to do a good job.</p>
</details>

Nicolola Tangen: 是的，我同意这种积极的态度。您面临的最重要的监管压力是什么？哪些监管压力让您有点恼火？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. No, I I share that uh I share that positive attitude. Um what what are the most important regulatory pressures you are facing? What what what kind of regulatory pressures are irritating you a bit? Ah, so I mean it's really</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 嗯，这真的很有趣，因为今年我们完成了Direct Line的交易，实际上得到了所有监管机构的大力支持。我知道你很少听到首席执行官这样说，但如果我们考虑**审慎监管局**（PRA: Prudential Regulation Authority，英国负责银行、保险公司和大型投资公司审慎监管的机构）、**金融行为监管局**（FCA: Financial Conduct Authority，英国金融行为监管局）和**竞争与市场管理局**（CMA: Competition and Markets Authority，英国竞争与市场管理局），能够在六个月内获得这三项批准，这确实是一项成就。我认为这显示了监管权力的一些变化，或者说监管态度的某些转变。但你看，如果我回顾过去几年，我们在**偿付能力英国规则**（Solvency UK rules: 英国脱欧后针对保险公司资本充足率和风险管理的监管框架）方面经历了重大变化。这是英国脱欧后最终确定的新偿付能力规则。我认为这些对保险公司来说是积极的。从FCA的角度来看，也就是行为监管机构，我认为我们遇到了一些挑战。例如，我们在实施新的**消费者义务**（Consumer Duty: 英国金融行为监管局推出的一项新规，要求金融服务公司以客户最佳利益行事）方面遇到了挑战。我认为这比所有人预想的要昂贵得多，也比所有人预想的要官僚得多。但我想我们现在已经度过了那个阶段。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">interesting because obviously having gone through um the direct line deal this year, we've actually had huge support from all of the regulatory authorities. I mean look I know that you don't hear CEOs saying that very often but if we think about the P, the FCA, the CMA, you know, to be able to get those three approvals within six months, you know, that was really quite an achievement. And I think it showed some of the regulatory um you know power coming coming through or some of the changes in the regulatory attitude coming through. But look you know if I think about the last number of years we've had big changes in terms of our solveny UK rules. You know this was the postrexit eventually we get to what the new solveny rules are. I think those have been positive for insurance companies from an FCA perspective the sort of conduct regulator. I think we have had some challenges. You know, we've had challenges around new the implementation of new consumer duty. It's been, I think, a lot more expensive than everybody thought it was going to be. It's been a lot more bureaucratic than everybody thought it was going to be. But I think we're through the end of that now.</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 但我确实认为我们看到了监管机构态度的转变。最近的一些公告，例如鼓励人们寻求建议，因为在英国，只有9%的人在退休问题上寻求建议。监管机构意识到，他们之前的一些做法可能阻止了人们寻求建议。我们现在正在就更多规则进行咨询，这将有助于解决这个问题。我是一个乐观主义者，我觉得这些变化将为客户带来积极的影响，也将为我们经营业务的方式带来积极的影响。

<p class="english-text">Um, but I but I I do think that we've definitely seen a change in attitude from the regulator. some of the most recent, you know, announcements around encouraging people to take advice because only 9% of people in the UK actually take advice when it comes to their sort of retirement. You know, the the regulator realizes that maybe some of the previous things that they had done had stopped people from taking advice. We've now got more more rules being consulted on that will help with that. I I look I'm an optimist and I feel that some of these changes are going to make a positive difference for customers and a positive difference for you know the way that we operate the business.</p>

### 英国消费者健康与退休储蓄

Nicolola Tangen: 您如何看待目前英国消费者的健康状况？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you read the health of the UK consumer now?</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 嗯，我认为英国消费者的健康状况，如果我考虑我们的经验，我们拥有最大的财富平台，管理着超过2000亿英镑的资产。我们是主要的职场养老金提供商，也是一个重要的储蓄平台。我认为对于我们的客户来说，我们看到了非常好的韧性。当然，保险是人们在困难环境中最后才会放弃的东西，但我们没有接到联系中心打来的电话说我们负担不起保险了，你们能帮帮我们吗？在疫情期间我们看到过一些这样的情况，但现在没有了。但我认为，本质上，如果我们考虑我们的目标市场，我们仍然面临一个问题，那就是英国有很多人没有车，他们处于非常绝望的境地。我们通过我们的社会行动工作看到了这一点。我们与**公民咨询局**（Citizens Advice Bureau: 英国一个提供免费、保密建议的慈善机构）以及**金钱咨询服务**（Money Advice Service: 英国一个提供免费、公正金钱建议的机构）合作。我们看到的是，那些没有储蓄的人，那些没有钱储蓄的人，以及那些没有储蓄养老金的人，他们正在挣扎，但他们一直都在挣扎。我认为我们正在努力帮助他们思考如何管理自己的生活。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So look I think the health of the UK consumer if I think about our our experience you know so we have a we have the biggest wealth platform over 200 billion pounds of the of of assets. So we're a big workplace pension provider and a and a big you know people save onto the um the advisor platform. I think for our customers they we have seen really good resilience. I mean there is also obviously the benefit that insurance is the last thing that people will sort of drop if they're in a sort of um in a challenged environment but we are not taking calls into the contact center of people saying we can't afford our insurance can you can you help us we were during periods of of COVID seeing some of that but we're not seeing that today but I think that I think in essence though what you know if we think about our as you know we are mass market you still have this issue in the UK that there there are lots of people that you know don't own cars that are in that are in a desperate desperate situation and we see that through the work that we do in our social action. So the work that we do with the citizens advice bureau the cit the work that we do the money with money advice service there what we see is that people who don't save you know who don't have money to save and those people who don't save into a pension they are struggling but they have always been struggling and I think you know what we're trying to do there is to really help them to think about how they can manage their lives.</p>

Nicolola Tangen: 如何让人们为退休储蓄更多？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you get people to save more for retirement? Well, I think there's a number of things. I think f first of</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 嗯，我认为有几件事。首先，在学校里，人们需要明白，如果你今天退休，你不会有**设定受益养老金**（Defined Benefit Pension: 退休金数额预先确定）。你只会拥有**设定缴费养老金**（Defined Contribution Pension: 退休金数额取决于缴费和投资表现）。在英国，有1500万人将无法安享退休。所以，我认为这种教育需要从小开始，然后贯穿他们的职业生涯。我认为政府可以提供帮助。从技术角度看，如果我们考虑像**自动加入养老金计划**（Auto-enrollment: 英国政府强制雇主自动为符合条件的员工加入职业养老金计划）的年龄，将年龄从22岁降到18岁开始储蓄，并将缴费比例从目前的8%提高到12%。这些都是我们知道会带来改变的事情。所以，我认为这需要个人承担责任、雇主通过教育提供帮助，当然，政府可以通过政策提供帮助。所以，我认为这是所有这些因素的结合。然后，我认为鼓励投资者不要只选择默认的养老基金并投资于最安全的资产，而是考虑投资于私人资产等，这些资产从长远来看会带来更好的回报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">all, understanding in schools that people need to understand that, you know, you're today if you are going to retire, you're not going to have a defined benefit pension. You're only going to have a defined contribution pension. And in the UK, 15 million people will not be able to retire well. So, I think getting that education, it needs to start young and then I think it needs to carry on through um through their working life. I think the government can help with that. technical eye if I think about you know things like autoenrollment age bring the age down from 22 to 18 where you start saving and increase the contribution from what it is today at 8% to 12%. These are things that we know will make a difference. Um, so I think it's a combination of taking individual responsibility, employers can help with education, definitely, you know, the government can help with policy. Um, so I think it's a combination of all of those things. And then I think encouraging investors to think about not just sort of taking the default pension fund and just investing in the safest assets, but thinking about investing in things like private assets that over the longer term will give a better return.</p>

### AI与气候变化对保险业的影响

Nicolola Tangen: 谈到我们现在看到的一些变化。人工智能如何改变保险业务？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moving on to some of the changes we're seeing just now. How is AI changing the insurance business?</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 天哪，影响巨大。如果我考虑Aviva，我们大约有150个人工智能用例。我们是人工智能的重度用户。例如，如果考虑我们的汽车定价，我们使用人工智能已经超过10年了，包括机器学习，我们零售产品的98%都是通过人工智能定价的。所以，举个例子，如果我18岁，买了一辆新的法拉利，我敢打赌我会支付很高的保费，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh my gosh, massively. I mean, if I think about Aviva, um, you know, we we've got about 150 use cases on on AI. I mean, look, we are very big users of AI. So, if we think about our motor pricing, we've been using AI for over 10 years, machine learning, and like 98% of our retail products are priced using AI. So for instance, if I'm 18 years old and I buy a new Ferrari, I bet I pay a high price, right?</p>
</details>

Nicolola Tangen: 是的。我想，你可能很难投保，Nicolai。一个18岁的年轻人开法拉利，这真的负责任吗？我不知道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean, you you probably would struggle to ensure that, Nikolai. I think an 18year-old driving a Ferrari, I mean, is that really responsible? I don't know, you know. Um, but yeah, I</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 但我们使用所有数据和机器学习已经很长时间了。如果你考虑英国市场的竞争力和活力，我们所有人都在不断使用不同的模型来获得最佳定价点。但如果我考虑一些更令人兴奋的事情，例如在我们的理赔领域，以前客户会打电话给我们查询理赔进度。他们会联系到一位处理人员。处理人员会从他们那里获取详细信息，查看所有不同系统的屏幕。现在，我们基本上使用了人工智能模型来预测客户打电话的可能原因，这样当客户打电话进来时，他们基本上是在与一位处理人员交谈，这位处理人员可以说：“我能看到您的理赔进度。”他们已经使用人工智能模型完成了所有欺诈检查，他们基本上可以帮助客户处理理赔，而不是在电话的前5到10分钟花费时间获取所有详细信息。所以，我认为这个用例可以应用于很多产品，因此这种结合使得保险业非常适合充分利用人工智能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">mean, we we've been using all of data and machine learning for a very very long time. If you think about how how competitive and dynamic the UK market is, we we everybody's sort of constantly using different models to get to your best pricing point. But if I think about some of the more exciting things, you know, in our claims world, for example, um, previously a customer would have been on calling us to check where a claim is in the process. They'd have got through to a handler. A handler would have taken details from them, looked through all the screens of all the different systems. Today we've we've we've basically used AI models to basic to to to predict the likely reason why the customer is calling so that when the customer gets through on the call they b they're basically speaking to a handler who can say I can see where you are in the claims process. You know they've done all the fraud checks using AI models and they can basically help the customer with the claim rather than spending the first 5 10 minutes of the call taking all of the details. So I think that that use case can apply to very many products and so that combination I think insurance is perfectly set to take real advantage of AI.</p>

Nicolola Tangen: 气候变化如何改变保险业务？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How is climate changing the insurance business?</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 嗯，我想**David Attenborough**（英国著名自然历史学家和电视节目主持人）最近说过，气候正在向世界发出求救信号。如果我们考虑我们在加拿大的业务，去年我们在大约四周内经历了六次**巨灾事件**（Catastrophe Event: 指造成大规模损失的自然灾害或人为事件）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well I mean look I think um I think David Atenburgh has recently said something that the climate is sending out distress signals to to the world and if we think about our business in Canada last year we had you know six cat events within about four weeks. cat event being</p>
</details>

Nicolola Tangen: 巨灾事件，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">catastrophe, right?</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 抱歉，是巨灾事件。抱歉，我用我的保险行业术语了，很高兴你懂。太棒了。所以，基本上，在四周内，你经历了野火、冰雹和洪水。这显然会影响保险公司，因为我们必须为此定价，必须能够建模。我们必须管理我们的风险敞口，必须真正考虑我们可以在哪些区域承保以及我们可以承保的容量。所以，它对我们来说非常重要。气候对我们来说真的非常重要，减轻一些气候变化的影响确实是我们工作的一部分。然后，如果我们把自己看作一个投资者，我们在Aviva投资者业务中拥有气候技术基金，这旨在为这些公司提供投资。我们正在努力帮助减轻气候变化的影响。所以，气候技术投资。我认为这很重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sorry, but being a catastrophe event. Sorry, talking in my insurance job and um good good that you knew. Fantastic. Um you know, so so essentially you had you had wildfires, you had hail storms, you had flooding all within, you know, the period of four weeks. So that obviously affects insurers because we have to price for that and we have to be able to model that. We have to manage our exposures and we have to really think about the zones in which we can underwrite and the capacity to which we can underwite. So effectively it matters a lot to us. Climate is really really important to us and you know mitigating some of that climate change is really part of of what we do. And then if we think of us as an investor we have you know climate tech funds in our Aviva investors business that's about offering I guess investment to those companies. We're trying to help with mitigating that. So climate climate tech um investments. So I think it matter it matters a lot.</p>

Amanda Blanc: 不，不，我理解这一点。我也理解，也许转型将以与我们2019年、2020年预期的不同方式发生，当时我认为每个人都非常积极。你知道，由于疫情，人们不开车，不坐飞机，所以每个人都认为转型会非常快。现在，我认为我们有了不同的看法。我们更加关注能源安全。但无论如何，转型迟早会发生。我认为问题只是何时发生，以及如何确保公司、国家、企业和个人开始思考如何减轻气候变化对他们的影响。我认为这一点不会改变。

I think now we have a different view. We have much more focus on energy security. But irrespective the transition will happen at some point. I think the question is just when and the question is ensuring that you know companies, countries, businesses, people do start thinking about how they can mitigate some of the impacts of climate change on them.

Nicolola Tangen: 你们将不再承保哪些类型的风险？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What are the type of risks you will you will no longer insure</p>
</details>

Nicolola Tangen: 因为气候原因？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because because of the climate</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 嗯，我认为在某种程度上，英国一直受到洪水的困扰。例如，如果我们考虑洪水，这是英国10到15年前的一个问题，发生了大量的洪水事件，人们发现他们无法获得保险。这是因为房屋建在洪泛区，或者建在生物多样性被破坏的地区，例如树木被砍伐导致河流泛滥。所以，我认为洪水是我们某些地区面临的挑战，因为洪水几乎是不可避免的，所以很难承保。在英国，我们有一个名为**Flood Re**（英国洪水再保险计划: 英国政府与保险业合作，为洪水高风险地区的房屋提供可负担的洪水保险）的计划，这是一个由保险公司和政府支持的计划，为这些地区提供保险，但有趣的是，不包括2001年（我不记得确切日期了，我想是2001年）之后建造的房屋，因为那时已经知道这些风险了。所以，我认为这些是您需要真正考虑的领域。然后，您显然必须管理您在其他领域的风险敞口，例如对于某些风险，我们可能不会承保前10万英镑（如果您认为这是一个企业），这样客户自己承担一部分风险。我总是举一个很好的例子，当我还在安盛工作时，坎布里亚地区发生了很多洪水事件。我们那里有很多客户，人们会重建他们的房屋，他们可能已经是第三次重建厨房了，但他们仍然会铺错地板，仍然会安装木制橱柜，仍然会在地板上设置插座。你会说，你必须更好地重建，这样才能更快地恢复。所以，我认为鼓励这一点也非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well I think to some extent the UK has struggled with flooding. So for example um if we think about about flooding and this was a 10 15 year ago issue in the UK lots and lots of flooding events and people were finding that they could not get insurance and that is because houses were being built on flood planes or being built in areas where biodiversity had been sort of you know trees had been taken away so rivers were flooding so so I think that flooding is some of the areas where we struggle in certain areas because of the almost inevitability of flooding happening to be able to ensure that and you know so in the in in the UK we have a scheme called flood which is a sort of insurer governmentbacked scheme to provide insurance for those areas but not interestingly for houses built after I can't remember the exact date I think it's 2001 because then at that point it was known so I think those are the areas where you have to really think about that and then you have to obviously manage your exposure in other areas to say you know for some risks you know we're not going to insure the first 100,000 if you think it's a business or something like in certain areas is so that customers take some of that risk themselves. You know, I use always a great example that when when I was um working at AXA, there were quite a lot of flooding events in the Cambria area. We had a lot of customers there and people would rebuild their houses and they'd be rebuilding it, you know, their kitchens for the third time, but they'd still be putting in the wrong flooring, they'd still be putting in wooden um kitchen units and they'd still be putting plug points down on the floor. and you know you you'd say you have to rebuild better and so that you can recover more quickly and so I think encouraging that is also really important.</p>

### 领导力、执行力与激励

Nicolola Tangen: 谈到领导力，对您来说，什么是好的领导力？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moving on to leadership uh what is good leadership to you? Um well f first of</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 嗯，首先，我认为是多听少说，能够很好地沟通，快速果断地做出决策，但更重要的是，要很好地贯彻这些决策。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">all I think uh listening as much as talking uh being able to communicate really well uh quick and decisive decision making but really importantly good follow through on that decision making</p>
</details>

Nicolola Tangen: 那么，最好的贯彻方式是什么？因为有人称您为“执行女王”。好的贯彻和执行意味着什么？您是如何做到的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and what's the best way to follow through because you you have been uh some people call you the execution queen. Um what does what is it what is good follow-up and good execution imply? How do you get there?</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 很多时候，你会看到，我不知道你是不是也经常看到，你听到领导力演讲，听到战略，人们说：“我有一个很棒的战略。”你看着幻灯片，心想：“是的，这听起来真的很棒。”然后，五年后你回过头来看，会想：“那件事后来怎么样了？”我认为战略很棒，但执行更重要。所以，如果你能很好地执行一个80%完善的战略，你可能会比拥有一个100%出色但未能贯彻执行的战略做得更好。这意味着什么？这意味着为业务中的每一个人，从我到联系中心的每一个人，设定非常明确的目标，以便真正实现贯穿。每个人都能理解业务的主要和核心目标吗？定期监控绩效。所以，我和我的首席财务官**Charlotte Jones**，她非常出色。我们与业务部门定期举行绩效管理会议，定期审查。你是否按照你说的去做了？如果没有，为什么？有什么变化？我们需要做些什么不同才能获得更好的结果？我认为这种持续的审查，真正的关心。我之前和你谈到客户。我们说客户是业务的核心。那么，业务中的所有行动都围绕着客户吗？我们每次执行委员会会议都以客户的投诉或赞扬开始。我们在执行委员会和董事会层面进行客户亲近会议，倾听客户的声音。所以，我认为这只是确保你的行动与你的言语一致。这听起来并不难，但我看到很多组织没有做到这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, so many times you see um I I don't know about you, you must see it all the time. You hear leadership presentations and you hear strategies and people say, "I've got this great strategy." Um and you look at the slides and you think, "Yeah, that sounds really, really good." And then, you know, you sort of look back five years later and go, I wonder what happened with that. You know, and um and I I think strategy is great, execution is better. Um, so you know I think you can if you execute well on a sort of 80% there strategy you would probably do better than you have you have a 100% brilliant strategy and don't follow through on the execution. What does it mean? It means you know having very clear objectives for absolutely everybody in the business from me to the you know to every single person in the contact center so that there's a real flow through can everybody connect with what the the principle and focus objectives of the business are regular monitoring of the performance. So, you know, with with my CFO, Charlotte Jones, I mean, she's phenomenal. You know, we have great performance management meetings with the business, regular reviews. Are you doing what you said you were going to do? If not, why? What has changed? What do we need to do differently to get to a better outcome? I think that constant review, really caring. So, I I talked to you about customer. We say the customer is at heart of the business. Are all the actions therefore in the business around the customer? We start every exco with a with a with a you know complaint or a compliment from customers. We do customer closeness sessions listening to our customers at an exco level at a board level. So I think it's just making sure that your actions match your words. I mean it doesn't sound that difficult and yet I see so many organizations that don't do that.</p>

Nicolola Tangen: 您如何激励员工？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you motivate people?</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 我认为成功是一个巨大的动力。通过小小的成功来展示这一点。所以在Aviva刚开始的时候，激励员工主要是给他们信心，让他们相信我们能做到，然后通过采取一些行动来表明我对此是认真的。如果人们看到他们为之工作的组织言出必行，那对他们来说是非常有动力的。人们关心客户，所以真正关注这一点。人们关心领导力，他们自己的发展，他们自己的职业生涯。我们是否关注这些事情？我们是否认真对待它们？然后是真正的同理心，理解他们正在处理的问题。如果我们考虑联系中心，你经常会去联系中心，和人们坐在一起，他们会说：“我正在尝试打电话给这个号码，连接这个电话，但没人接，没人听。”实际上，解决这个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well I think success is a big motivator you know show showing them that in small bits. So at the beginning in ter the motivation at Aviva was basically giving them the confidence that I believed that we could do this and then by starting to do some of the actions to show that actually I was serious about this. That's very motivating for people if they see that they're working for an organization that is doing what it said it's going to do. That's highly motivating. People care about customers really focusing on that. People care about leadership, their own development, their own careers. Are we focused on those things? are we taking them seriously? And then really empathizing, understanding the issues that they're they're dealing with. If we think of, you know, the contact centers, you'd often go to the contact centers and and you'd sit with people and they'd say, you know, I'm trying to phone this number, connect this call, nobody answers, nobody listens. Actually taking that problem away and solving it.</p>

</details>

Amanda Blanc: 哦，我想我喜欢用“每天都是学习日”这句话。我认为你的领导风格确实会改变。有些东西是相同的，比如沟通能力，沟通的愿望，简化故事。我认为这些是相同的。但你学到了很多，例如，你如何连接你的团队，选择你的团队。我想在29岁的时候，你可能需要更长的时间来做出人事决定，即使你已经知道正确的决定是什么，但你可能会花更长的时间。今天，我认为你必须更快地信任你的判断。你以前看过这部电影，你会想：“是的，我见过这部电影，这部电影结局不好，我们早点做决定吧。”我认为这些是你学到的东西。而且我认为，那种退一步，信任你周围团队的能力。你现在比那时更有赋权意识。我认为你可以识别出优秀的人才。你希望优秀的人才为你工作。你绝不会因此感到威胁，你只是让他们去做。我认为这与你29岁时不同。你当时可能对此有不同的看法。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Oh, I think I I I'd like I use the expression every day is a school day. And I think your leadership style does change.

But you learn so much you know uh you learn so much about for example you know the way you connect your te select your teams uh you know I think at the age of 29 you might take a little longer to make a people decision even though you sort of know the right decision to make but you might take a little bit longer today I think you have to you trust your judgment a lot more quickly you've seen the the movie run before and you're like yeah I've seen this movie run this movie doesn't end well let's make a decision you know early on I think Those are the things you learn. And I think also that ability to just step back. Um, you know, and trust the team around you. You you you are much I'm much more empowering today than I would have been then. You know, I think you can identify brilliant people. You want brilliant people working for you. You're not in any way threatened by that and you just let them get on with it. I think that's that's different to when you were 29. You probably were a you thought about it a little bit differently then.</p>

<p class="english-text">You're also known for your kind of direct communication style.

So, how do you how do you communicate in a direct manner in a in a society when where it's not very common?</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 但我认为你可以既友善又直接。所以，我不想变得刻薄。我只是觉得，通过刻薄或恶毒，你什么也得不到。实际上，当我给出反馈或我们在这里讨论事情时，我总是说，我们必须诚实，但我们必须以友善的方式进行。所以，要礼貌，要友善，但要诚实。如果一个问题确实存在，假装它不存在是没有意义的。所以我真诚地觉得，我和我的团队每月都会进行一对一的交流，他们也会和他们的团队进行一对一的交流，我们不断地说：“我们做得好的是什么？我们能做得更好的是什么？”我认为以这种方式构建对话，你总是知道会有一些好的方面，但也会有一些我们可以为未来发展而努力的方面。所以，我认为你可以用友善的方式做到这一点。你可以带着微笑做到这一点。但你确实要诚实，如果你绕弯子试图传达一个信息，那会花费很长时间，非常累人，人们也不理解，所以他们肯定会更欣赏你更直接。

Effectively, what you what when I give feedback or when we are talking about things here, I always say, you know, we have to be honest, but we have to do it in a nice way. So, be polite, do it nicely, but be honest. There's no point in pretending that something isn't an issue if it is an issue. So I I genuinely feel that you know when I I have oneto ones with my team every month and they have oneto ones with their team and we are we are constantly saying okay what did we do well and what could we do better and I think in in framing the conversation like that you know you always know there's going to be you know something something good but but but also something where we can we can we can work on our development for the future. So, I think you can do it in a nice way. You can do it with a smile on your face. Um, you can you can but you but you but you do honestly like if you're running around the houses trying to get a message through, it takes an awful long time.

Amanda Blanc: 你们也是。就金融界女性而言，很明显，英国金融服务业女性存在问题，政府在大约10年前就认识到了这一点，并设立了**金融界女性宪章**（Women in Finance Charter: 英国政府发起的一项旨在促进金融服务业性别平等的倡议）。然后他们显然一直在努力增加金融服务业女性的比例，因为他们相信，通过增加餐桌上的多样性，最终会做出更好的决策。现在，我从最广泛的意义上思考多样性，但当然，它也适用于性别。所以我们一直在与政府和其他金融服务公司非常努力地合作，以拓宽保险、银行、投资银行对女性的**可及性**（accessibility）。我认为正是通过拓宽这种可及性，我们才能引入更多元化的劳动力。

<p class="english-text">You are and now as far as the the women in finance was concerned. What was clear was that you know there was a that there was a problem there is a problem with women in financial services um in the UK which the government actually actually recognized about 10 years ago and set up the women in finance charter and then they you know obviously they have been trying to improve the number of women in financial services roles because the belief is was that by having more diversity around the table you get you ultimately get better decisions. Now I think about that that in diversity in its broadest form but certainly you know it def it will also apply to to gender and so we've been working really really hard with the government with other financial services firms to broaden um the the accessibility of insurance of banking of investment banking to women and it is by broadening that accessibility I think that we can we can bring um a more diverse workforce in</p>

Nicolola Tangen: 部分由于这项工作，您于1月4日被授予**女爵士**（Damehood: 英国荣誉制度中授予女性的最高荣誉之一，相当于男性爵士）称号。对于不了解的听众来说，这相当于女性被授予爵士头衔，对吧？这是一件大事，对吧？

<p class="english-text">partly because of this work um you were appointed at Dame in January 4. And for the uh listeners who don't know, it's uh uh it's the um it's kind of the um the equivalent of being knighted, right, for um for women. Um and it's a huge thing, right? Um</p>

Amanda Blanc: 是的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">yes.</p>
</details>

Nicolola Tangen: 在英国社会中，这对您个人意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In in the in the English society, what what did it mean for you personally?</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 嗯，首先，我出生在英国南威尔士的朗达谷。我的祖父母都是矿工。我上的是一所综合学校，然后作为一名毕业生培训生在Commercial Union开始工作，当时甚至不真正了解保险是什么，或者没有考虑过它。所以最终获得女爵士称号，这实际上是为了表彰我对商业、气候和性别平等这三方面的贡献。这对我来说意味着全世界。显然，对我来说，对我家人来说，那是一个非常非凡的日子。我的父亲当时已经去世了，我知道他一定会为此感到非常自豪。但想到我能从我来的地方走到这一步，真是太棒了。我对此绝不认为理所当然。而且我认为，对于像我这样的人，当我到学校去和孩子们交流时（我参加一个名为**学校演讲者计划**（Speakers for Schools: 一个慈善机构，旨在将各行各业的领导者与公立学校的学生联系起来）的活动），当我回到我以前上过的学校时，孩子们能够看到，你可以从我来的位置在商界取得成功。我认为这也很重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um well, first of all, you know, I I was born in the Ronda Valley in South Wales, uh in the UK. My both of my grandparents were minors. I went to a comprehensive school um and I started at commercial union as a graduate traininee not knowing even really what insurance was or thinking about it. So to end up with a damehood um which actually was for contributions to business for contributions to climate and for contributions to gender for those those three things. I mean it went meant the world to me obviously. It was a really it was a really phenomenal um day for me and my family and you know my mom and my my you know my dad had passed away at that point and and I I just know he would have been so proud of that. Um but to just think that you can come from where I came from um you know to to that was was just amazing. And um and I don't take that for granted at all. And you know and I do think that um you know that that that you know for somebody like me when I go out to schools and speak to to the kids and I'll go back to schools I do something called speakers for schools. when I go back to schools that like the school that I went to, you know, for kids to be able to see that it's you can make it in business, you know, from the position that I came from. I think that's really important, too.</p>
</details>

Nicolola Tangen: 我曾看到一项研究说，如果你被授予爵士或女爵士称号，公司的业绩会随后恶化，因为人们更多地考虑社会，更多地将自己视为国家人物，因此在解雇员工等方面会更加犹豫。您认为这其中有道理吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I saw a piece of research once which said that if you were kned or appointed a dame uh the results of the company uh deteriorated afterwards because people thought more because people thought more about society and uh uh saw themselves a bit more as a state person and therefore were more hesitant for instance to lay off people. Do you think there is a kernel of truth in that?</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 不。我思考问题的方式和以前没有任何不同。我实际上在办公室里从不使用这个头衔，也从不使用。我的意思是，如果我参加晚宴，其他人可能会使用，但我不会。如果有人叫我“女爵士Amanda”，我会说：“请不要那样叫我。叫我Amanda，那是我的名字。”而且我确实认为，这丝毫没有改变。如果你看看Aviva去年的业绩，它比前一年的业绩更好。我们将在未来几个月内继续做出艰难的决定，因为我们将不得不整合Direct Line和Aviva。你知道，决策仍然需要做出，这丝毫没有改变我的方法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No. I mean I I don't I don't think any differently to how I thought before. I mean I don't actually use the title in the office uh or or at all. I mean I you know I I it will get used if I go to dinners by other by other people but I don't I don't do that. If people call me Dam Amanda I will say please don't call me that. Call me Amanda that's my name. Um and and I do think that you know it hasn't one iota changed. If you look at the performance of Aviva, you know, last year, it was better than the performance of Aviva the year before. And we will continue to make the tough decisions as we'll have to make as we go through the integration of direct line and Aviva over the coming months. You know, decisions still need to be taken and it hasn't in one way changed my my approach.</p>

Nicolola Tangen: 没错。作为威尔士人意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely. What does it mean what does it mean to be Welsh?</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 嗯，我非常非常自豪能成为威尔士人。威尔士是一个非常小的国家，大约340万人。如果你想想它发生了什么，那里真的没有投资，采矿业是关键产业，显然矿井被关闭了，这是非常正确的。我的意思是，关闭的方式可能不是我希望的方式，但它们在1980年代被关闭了，而且没有任何东西取代它。所以，我认为作为威尔士人，来自那个背景，对我来说意义重大。我非常非常自豪。我的意思是，显然你非常自豪于橄榄球，非常自豪于音乐，这些都是威尔士人非常自豪的事情，但也自豪于我所来自的那个时代。以及我的背景，我的父母和祖父母所取得的成就。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Uh I I mean I'm incredibly proud uh of being Welsh. Um so you know Wales is a very small country um you know 34 million people. um which has actually if I think about you know what has happened to it you know there's been no investment really mining was the key industry and obviously the mines were closed quite rightly um you know I mean the way it was done was probably not the way I would have done it but they they were they were closed uh in the 1980s and and ne nothing ever replaced it and so I think you know being Welsh and and coming from that background that does mean a lot to me I'm very very proud of it um I mean obviously you very proud of rugby, very proud of music, um the things that Welsh people are very proud of, but also proud of just the the era that I came from.

Yes.</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 我认为驱动力是来自那个背景，看到那个社区发生了什么。而且知道那里被取代的工作没有任何东西来替代，这让我内心总有一种信念，那就是我会为自己做得更好，因为我能。当我看到那里很多人所遭受的一切，以及直到今天我的母亲仍然住在朗达谷，我经常回去，看到那里仍然没有恢复，这绝对是一种驱动力。是的。

<p class="english-text">You played a lot of instruments when you were younger. What uh what what's the function of music in your life?</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 嗯，好吧。我弹过钢琴和单簧管，当然，像所有优秀的威尔士人一样，我在当地的教堂和唱诗班唱歌。我认为音乐是一种真正的逃避。我喜欢各种各样的音乐。昨天我听了Chapel Rowan和Sabrina Carpenter的歌。然后我也听音乐剧。我周五要去听《汉密尔顿》。我只是觉得音乐对我来说真的很重要。我爱它。在很多方面，它是一种平衡。一些最有才华的音乐家，你知道，他们拥有那种真正的天赋，尽管我没有那种真正的天赋，我必须努力练习。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um all right. I mean, so I played the piano and the clarinet and of course like all good Welsh people, I sang in in the local chapel and in the choir. I think music is just it's a real escape. Um I I love all sorts of music. You know, yesterday I was listening to uh to Chapel Rowan and Sabrina Carpenter. Then I can be also listening to musicals. Um, I'm going to see Hamilton on Friday. I just I just think that music is really it's really important to me. I I love it. In many respects, it's a leveler. Some of the most talented musicians um and and you know, I just I have that real gift, though I don't have the real gift. I had to work hard at it.</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 但我真的很尊重这是一种天赋。所以，我们家里总是放着音乐。总是。你知道，我妈妈直到今天，早上五点起床做的第一件事就是放音乐，通常是一堆歌剧，或者音乐剧里的歌曲，或者其他什么。她会一整天都放着音乐。

Um I I I I really like that where you're sort of listening, you're listening to the debates. Um at the at the same time as you can sometimes be doing something else. I can be on the treadmill or I can be on my bike or doing something else. So I think it's quite an efficient use of time. So I I I really love that.</p>

### 对年轻人的建议

Nicolola Tangen: 最后，我们有很多年轻的听众。您对年轻人最好的建议是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Lastly, we got um many thousand young listeners. What is your best advice to young people?</p>
</details>

Amanda Blanc: 嗯，首先，我认为要培养你的韧性。我认为今天的年轻人很艰难。如果我们考虑他们成长的环境，社交媒体，持续的反馈，无论是气候变化还是转型，劳动力结构的变化，**生成式人工智能**（Generative AI: 能够生成文本、图像或其他媒体内容的人工智能），我认为他们需要非常有韧性。所以，他们应该真正思考如何培养自己的韧性。然后我想说的第二件事是，抓住摆在你面前的机会。很多人常常想太多。你知道，有时事情会成功，有时不会。但要抓住机会，因为你永远不知道它们会把你带到哪里。所以，无论是在学校，去不同的社团，尝试唱歌，尝试乐器，尝试不同的运动，只要抓住这些真正的机会，你永远不知道会发生什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well well first of all I think um build up your resilience. I think it's tough for young people today. If we think about, you know, the environment in which they're they're they're growing up in social media, you know, the constant feedback, um the, you know, whether it's climate or the transition, the change in workforce regenerative AI, I think they're going to need to be really resilient. So, they should really think about things that they can do to build their resilience. And then the second thing I would say is like take the opportunities that are given to you. There's so many times that people overthink things. You know, sometimes things will work out and sometimes they will not. But take opportunities because you just never know where they're going to end up. So whether that's at school, go to different clubs, try singing, try musical instruments, try different sports, just take those real opportunities and you just never know what might happen.</p>
</details>

Nicolola Tangen: 嗯，Amanda，您是抓住所有机会并从中取得巨大成就的绝佳典范。与您交谈非常愉快。非常令人印象深刻。谢谢您。
