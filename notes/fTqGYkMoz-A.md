### 阿拉斯加永久基金：独特的美国主权财富基金

**Joe Weisenthal:** 大家好，欢迎收听新一期的“Odd Lots”播客。我是乔·魏森塔尔。

<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to another episode of the OddLotss podcast. I'm Joe Weisenthal.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 我是特蕾西·阿洛韦。乔，我们回到了纽约市，这里温暖宜人，日落时间正常，我不需要遮光窗帘，但我们最近的阿拉斯加之旅非常愉快。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I'm Tracy Aloway. Tracy, we're back here in New York City where it's warm and the sun sets at a normal hour of the day and I don't need to have blackout curtains, but I had a really good time on our uh our recent voyage to Alaska.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 阿拉斯加很棒。我不知道为什么那里的总人口一直在下降。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Alaska was great. I don't know why the overall state population has been declining.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 是啊，我不知道，它很棒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I don't I don't It's great.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 你搬到那里，至少夏天天气很好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You move there, there's nice weather, at least in the summer.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 夏天，风景优美。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the summer, beautiful scenery. Yes.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 河里有取之不尽的三文鱼。而且每年你还能从州政府那里得到一些钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As much salmon as you can fish out of the rivers. And every year you get paid some money by the state.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 是的，没错。不，它有很多优点。我想它适合特定类型的人。它确实有很多值得称赞的地方。但它真的很棒。你知道，我以前对阿拉斯加了解不多。我对它的布局没什么概念。我对它的地理位置也没什么感觉。我真的觉得我好像身处帝国的最西边，非常非常遥远。而且……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, that's exactly right. No, there is a lot to like about it. I think it's for a type of person. It certainly has a lot going for it. But it was really nice. You know, I didn't really know much about Alaska. I didn't have much fuel for its layout. I didn't much have much feel for its geography. I truly did feel like I was sort of at the far western edge of the empire out there. Very, very distant. And</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 它有一种非常边疆的感觉。我的意思是，这就是为什么他们称之为“最后的边疆”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it has a very frontier feel. I mean, that's why they call it the last frontier.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 极强的边疆感。当然，我们和那里的各行各业的人都聊过。但正如你所说，人们对阿拉斯加了解的一件事是，那里有石油，而且那里还有一种类似**主权财富基金**（Sovereign Wealth Fund: 由政府拥有和管理的投资基金，通常由国家盈余或资源收入提供资金）的东西，而且每个年满18个月或10个月（或其他）的公民都能从州政府那里得到一张支票，这听起来相当不错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Extremely frontier feel. And of course we talked to people in all kinds of industry there etc. But as you mentioned one thing that people know about Alaska I mean people know there's oil and also people know that there is something that kind of resembles perhaps a sovereign wealth fund and also that every citizen over I think the age of like 18 months or whatever 10 months or something gets a check from the state which sounds pretty nice.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 这听起来不错。它也听起来像一个充满政治和金融争议的烫手山芋，对吧？我可以想象每年可能都会有大量的争论，关于到底要分配多少钱，这对基金的未来意味着什么，以及它如何与州和联邦资金互动。我很期待讨论它与更广泛的美国的新关联，因为现在有人讨论启动一个美国主权财富基金，而且特朗普政府也提出了给儿童（包括婴儿）支付款项的提议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It sounds nice. It also sounds like a loaded political and financial hot potato, right? And I can imagine every year there is probably lots and lots of debate about exactly how much is going to be dispersed, what it means for the future of the fund, how it interacts with state and federal funding. I'm excited to talk about that new relevance right to the wider United States of America because there is talk about starting a US sovereign wealth fund and there is also the payments for kids for infants from the Trump administration.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 没错，没错。联邦层面是否真的会设立一个类似主权财富基金或任何形式的基金，谁知道呢？但我们有所有这些事物的特定模型，值得更多地了解它们是如何运作的。我认为，为了结束我们对阿拉斯加的智力之旅和实际旅程，我们必须触及这个要素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's right. That's right. Whether anything at the federal level that resembles a sovereign wealth fund or any sort of fund would actually happen, who knows? But we have certain models of all this stuff and it's worth learning a little bit more how they work. And I do think to sort of conclude our our intellectual journey and our literal journey to Alaska, we sort of have to touch on this element.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 绝对如此。我们开始吧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely. Let's do it.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 好的。我很高兴地说，我们请来了两位最合适的嘉宾来谈论**阿拉斯加永久基金**（Alaska Permanent Fund）及其运作方式。我们将与马库斯·弗兰普顿（Marcus Frampton）对话，他是阿拉斯加永久基金的**首席投资官**（CIO: Chief Investment Officer），以及德文·米切尔（Devin Mitchell），他是阿拉斯加永久基金的**首席执行官**（CEO: Chief Executive Officer）。马库斯和德文，非常感谢你们两位来到“Odd Lots”播客。

### 阿拉斯加永久基金的起源与演变

**Joe Weisenthal:** 为什么我们不从你们中的一位开始，简单地告诉我们基金的规模是多少，以及它是何时、为何成立的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why don't we start with maybe one of you could just give us the very quick like what is the size of the fund and how when and why was it started?</p>
</details>

**Devin Mitchell:** 好的，我是德文·米切尔，我来回答这个问题。当你们想到阿拉斯加时，你们当然只看到了阿拉斯加的一小部分样本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So this is Devin Mitchell and I'll take the that question. When you think about Alaska and you guys have a just a small sample of Alaska, of course,</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 当你们想到它时，你们去了阿拉斯加最大的城市，但如果你们把阿拉斯加叠加到美国本土上，你们会发现……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when you think about it, you went to the largest city in Alaska, but if you superimposed Alaska over the continental US, you would have</p>
</details>

**Devin Mitchell:** 阿拉斯加会触及东西海岸以及南北边界。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">each of the coasts touched by Alaska as well as the southern and northern borders.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 所以，它是一个巨大的州。假设你们去了内布拉斯加州。所以，你们并没有真正体验到阿拉斯加所提供的一切，但听起来你们确实得到了一个很好的样本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it's a huge state. Let's say you went to Nebraska. So, you didn't really experience all that Alaska has to offer, but certainly, it sounds like you got a good sample.</p>
</details>

**Devin Mitchell:** 这个州是一个年轻的州。我们于1959年建州。当阿拉斯加建州时，人们非常担心阿拉斯加在经济上能否自给自足，因为人口相对较少，地理位置偏远，对这个州缺乏了解。因此，这个州被创建为一个资源州，这意味着州政府保留了在建州时选择的阿拉斯加土地的地下矿产权利。因此，在1968年，北美最大的油田**普拉德霍湾**（Prudhoe Bay）被发现。次年，即1969年，一次租赁销售为州政府带来了9亿美元的收入。这在当时州政府预算只有1.5亿美元的情况下，是一笔惊人的巨款。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The state's a young state. We became a state in 1959. And when Alaska became a state, there was a lot of concern about the ability of Alaska to support itself economically because of a relatively small population, remote location, lack of understanding about the state. And so the state was created as a resource state, meaning that the state retained the right the subservice mineral rights of the land in Alaska that it selected at statehood. And so in 1968, Prudo Bay was discovered, the largest oil field in North America. And the next year in 1969, there was a lease sale that generated $900 million of revenue for the state. And this is at a time when the state's budget was $150 million. And so an incredible amount of money for the day</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 对州政府来说。人们认为这笔钱太多了，他们不可能全部花完。它启动了一个过程，最终导致了**跨阿拉斯加输油管道**（Trans-Alaska Pipeline）的建设。但到了20世纪70年代中期，这笔钱显然将在跨阿拉斯加输油管道完工之前用尽。这使得人们认识到石油是一种一次性的有限资源，是一种收入来源。当时有一些有远见的人愿意将他们当年收入的一部分留给阿拉斯加的后代。这最终在1976年通过了一项宪法修正案，将25%的特许权使用费收入专门用于阿拉斯加州。它要求一旦节省下来的收入必须进行投资，并且要求基金的收益可供州政府使用。因此，我们随后启动了**永久基金分红**（Permanent Fund Dividend: 阿拉斯加永久基金向符合条件的居民支付的年度款项）计划，让居民在计划中拥有股份，如今它已发展成为我们最大的单一收入来源，约占州政府收入的60%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">for the state. People thought it was so much money they couldn't possibly spend it all. It initiated a process that resulted in the Trans Alaska pipeline being constructed. But by the mid 1970s, that money was clearly going to be finally expended before the Trans Alaska pipeline was completed. And that set the stage for people to recognize that oil was a one-time finite resource in a revenue generator. And there were forwardthinking people of that generation that were willing to set aside a portion of their current year revenue for the benefit of future generations of Alaskans. And that culminated with a constitutional amendment in 1976 that dedicated 25% of royalty revenues to the state of Alaska. It required that that that revenue once saved be invested and it required that the earnings of the fund be made available to the state. And so we've subsequently initiated the permanent fund dividend program to allow residents to have a stake in the program and it's evolved today to where it's our largest single revenue source at approximately 60% of the state's revenue.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 是的，那是一大笔钱。马库斯，你能不能从投资组合的角度，向我们谈谈基金是如何随着时间演变的？所以，1976年，基金成立了。最初的投资看起来是怎样的，今天又是什么样子？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, that's a that's a hefty chunk. Marcus, why don't you give us from the sort of portfolio standpoint, talk to us about how the fund has evolved over time. So 1976, you know, it gets set up. What do the initial investments look like and what do they look like today?</p>
</details>

**Marcus Frampton:** 是的，当然。我是马库斯·弗兰普顿，首席投资官。最初，基金成立时，我们正处于一个非常高的利率环境。70年代末，股票已经失宠，所以直到80年代中期，它基本上是一个**固定收益**（Fixed Income: 指能提供固定或可预测收入流的投资，如债券）基金。房地产在那个时候作为第二**资产类别**（Asset Class: 具有相似特征并受相同市场规则约束的投资组合）被引入。90年代初，首先是国内股票，然后90年代中期又加入了国际股票。2000年代初，我们增加了对冲基金、**私人信贷**（Private Credit: 直接向公司提供的非银行贷款）和**私募股权**（Private Equity: 对非上市公司或上市公司的非公开股权进行投资），并像我们的许多同行，如大学捐赠基金和养老金一样，发展了这些**另类资产**（Alternative Assets: 传统资产类别（如股票、债券）以外的投资，如对冲基金、私募股权、房地产等）。所以今天，基金本身的规模约为850亿美元。我们最大的资产类别是**公开股票**（Public Equities: 在证券交易所公开交易的股票）。这笔资金是根据“所有国家世界指数”（All Country World Index）进行管理的，这是一个非常全球化的指数。我们内部交易从高收益到投资级别的债券，然后另类资产和私募股权目前约占基金的40%。所以我们的资产配置与许多大学捐赠基金或养老基金今天的配置并无不同。我们的目标是实现通胀加5%的回报，目的是将基金约5%的资金分配给州政府，用于州支出和分红计划，然后让剩余部分维持其价值与通胀同步，这就是我们设定通胀加5%目标的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, sure. So this is Marcus Frampton. I'm the chief investment officer. Initially, when the fund was set up, we were in a very high interest rate environment. At the end of the 70s, equities had kind of fallen out of favor and so it was very much a fixed income fund up until the mid 1980s. Real estate was introduced at that point as the second asset class. In the early '9s, first domestic stocks and then later in the mid '90s, international stocks were added. In the early 2000s, we added hedge funds and private credit and private equity and have grown those alternative asset classes like many of our peers, the university endowments and pensions have grown. So today the fund itself is around $85 billion. Our largest asset class is is public equities. That money is managed against the all country world index. So a very global index. We trade bonds internally high yield through investment grade and then have alternatives and privates that are kind of 40% of the fund today. So our asset allocation is not unlike you know many university endowments or pension funds today. And we managed to an inflation plus 5% return with the aim of dispersing roughly 5% of the fund to the state both for state spending and the dividend program and then having the remainder maintain its value with inflation is why we target that inflation plus five.</p>
</details>

### 基金在市场下行期的管理

**Tracy Alloway:** 我很好奇，你知道，市场就是市场，有时资产估值在一年内会下降。那么，当遇到糟糕的一年时，比如2022年股市表现相当糟糕，或者2008年和2009年股市表现糟糕时，基金或阿拉斯加会发生什么？当你们无法满足州政府收入需求，或者部分分红需求时，会发生什么？基金在运作方式上以及州预算方面会发生什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm curious, you know, markets are markets and sometimes asset valuations go down in a year. What happens then for either the fund or Alaska when there's a bad year? Maybe it's like 2022 and stocks have a pretty rough year or 2008 and 2009 and stocks have a rough year. What happens when you can't satisfy the demand for state revenue or you know I guess partly those dividends? What happens both with the fund in terms of how and how the state budget works?</p>
</details>

**Marcus Frampton:** 是的。嗯，从宏观层面来看，我们有一个非常复杂的系统，包括受宪法保护的本金和积累已实现收益的**收益储备账户**（Earnings Reserve Account）。因此，在投资层面，我们正在进行再平衡。我们正在购买股票，并做所有投资者都会做的事情。但我会把它交给德文，让他谈谈我们如何考虑在这些情况下收益储备面临的压力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Well, at a high level, we've got a very complicated system with a constitutionally protected principle and then an earnings reserve that accumulates realized earnings. And so, at the investment level, we're rebalancing. We're buying stocks and doing all the things all investors do. But I'll hand it to Devon on how we think about the pressure on the earnings reserve in those situations.</p>
</details>

**Devin Mitchell:** 当然。正如我之前所说，宪法在建立基金时非常宽泛。然后在此之上还有一个法定叠加。这个法定叠加将可用于拨款的收益或收入定义为已实现收入。因此，当我们有未实现收入时，我们将其保留在本金或我们称之为收益储备账户中。我们在这里持有基金的已实现收益和未实现收益的按比例分配。所以，当你们分解马库斯之前提到的850亿美元时，你们会发现大约有590亿美元是永久基金受保护的本金。然后有大约130亿美元的未实现收益分配给本金。然后是收益储备账户，这是立法机构可以拨款的部分。目前，它有大约64亿美元可供拨款，还有大约23亿美元的未实现收益分配给它。这些加起来大约是90亿美元。然后我们还有当年的**市场价值百分比**（Percent of Market Value, PMV）。我们的PMV结构自2019年才开始实施。它是一个**历史五年平均5%提取结构**（Historical 5-year average 5% draw structure: 指基金每年从其过去五年平均市场价值中提取5%用于支出和分红）。正如我所说，自那时以来，它一直提供州政府的大部分收入，但在此之前，永久基金只为永久基金分红提供资金。所以这是我们在过去六七年经历的一个重大转变。至于我们在负收益年份会怎么做，如果我们有未实现亏损，它只会减少我们目前拥有的未实现收益的“战备金”。如果它侵蚀到超过那个水平，那么在某个时候，收益储备账户就会出现赤字，并且将无法向阿拉斯加州提供转账。这部分也是为什么我们基金根据受托人的指示一直在倡导，将基金从50年前创建的历史模型演变为更现代、更符合真正的捐赠基金或主权财富基金的模型，并认识到它现在对州年度收入流的重要性。所以，在像2025年这样的年份，如果乔和我当时在场，也许考虑到阿拉斯加，我们更像是房间里的蚊子，如果我们在场决定今年的分红金额，实际的对话会是怎样的？你们在宣布这个数字时会考虑哪些因素？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure. So, as I said earlier, the the constitution was pretty broad in how it established the fund. And then there's a statutory overlay on top of that. And the statutory overlay defines earnings or revenue that's available to appropriate as realized income. And so when we have unrealized income, we hold it in either principal or what we call the earnings reserve account. That's where we hold the realized earnings of the fund and a prata allocation of unrealized earnings. So, so when you break down that 85 billion that Marcus referred to earlier, you have about 59 billion that's actually protected principle of the permanent fund. Then you have about 13 billion of unrealized gains allocated to principal. And then you have the earnings reserve account which is the portion that the legislature can appropriate out of. It has about 6.4 billion that's available for appropriation at this point has about 2.3 billion of unrealized gains that are allocated towards it. And then that combined is around $9 billion. And then we have the current year's PMV. And our PMV structure has only been in place since 2019. It's a historical 5-year average 5% draw structure. and has like I said been providing the majority of state revenues since but prior to that the only thing funded out of the permanent fund were permanent fund dividends. So that was a big shift time frame that we've gone through in the last six or seven years. As far as what we would do in a negative earnings year if we had unrealized losses, it would just diminish that war chest of unrealized gains we currently have. If it were to erode beyond that level, then you would be in a situation at some point where the the earnings reserve account would be deficient and there wouldn't be a an ability to provide for a transfer to the state of Alaska. And that in part is why we've been advocating at the fund based on our trustees direction to evolve the fund from this historical model created 50 years ago to something that's a little more modern and more a little more in line with a true endowment or sovereign wealth fund and recognize the importance to the the state's annual revenue stream that it now represents. So, in a year like 2025, if Joe and I were flies in the room when you were maybe actually mosquitoes in the room, given that it's Alaska, if we were in the room when you were making the decision about what this year's dividend payout is actually going to be, what would the conversations actually sound like? What are the considerations that you're thinking about as you announce this number?</p>
</details>

### 分红决策与政治压力

**Devin Mitchell:** 首先，我们不是那些“苍蝇”。我们不决定永久基金分红的金额。我们只是赚取并向州政府提供年度转账。决定分红金额的决策者是立法机构和州长。因此，在2019年，当他们创建市场价值百分比的法定结构时，他们保留了历史的或遗留的永久基金分红法规，这是一个收益模型。它是过去五个已完成财政年度收益的21%。你取这个数字，然后分成两半。一半用于永久基金分红，一半理论上归州政府，尽管州政府总是把他们那一半放回基金。因此，我们的州长在他执政的每一年都提议遵循这个公式来确定永久基金分红。困难在于阿拉斯加州的石油收入已经减少。它们不再足够强劲，无法提供居民所期望的服务。因此，立法机构经历了一个过程，以确定他们能提供多少永久基金分红。同时，他们还要提供居民所期望的某种程度的服务。正如你可能预料到的，在选举年，奇迹般地他们会找到方法提供更大的永久基金，而在非选举年，他们可能会更加节俭。但这在过去六年里一直是一场斗争和更多的辩论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, first of all, we're not those flies. We don't decide how big the permanent fund dividend is going to be. We just earn and provide the annual transfer to the state. The policy makers that decide how much the dividend is going to be or the legislature and the governor. So in 2019 when they created the percent of market value statutory structure, they left in place the historic the historical or legacy permanent fund dividend statute which was an earnings model. It was 21% of the last five completed fiscal years earnings. You take that, you take split it in half. Half goes to the permanent fund dividend, half goes theoretically to the state, although the state always just put their half back into the fund. And so our governor has proposed each year of his administration that that formula be followed for purposes of establishing the permanent fund dividend. The difficulty has been that oil revenues have diminished for the state of Alaska. They're no longer robust enough to provide for the services that re residents expect. And so the legislaturator's gone through a process of determining how much can they provide for a permanent fund dividend. At the same time, they provide some level of services that the residents expect. And as you might be able to predict during an election year, miraculously they find ways to have a little bit larger permanent fund and during non-election years maybe they're a little more austere. But it's it's been a struggle and a more of a debate these last six years.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 是的。实际上，你能从你思考阿拉斯加州的长期健康、基金的长期健康等角度，多谈谈这个问题吗？政治民选领导人或像你们这样负责长期维护基金以造福阿拉斯加州的人，如何避免本质上“吃掉种子”（eating the seedcore: 指为了短期利益而消耗掉长期赖以生存的资源）？因为我们谈论的就是这个，对吧？当然，在选举年，无论是民主党还是共和党，都会主张保护或扩大分红，而不考虑业绩，不考虑石油特许权使用费的多少。你们如何保持，你知道，我认为在华盛顿特区也有类似版本的辩论。讨论如何保持这些选择在长期内财政负责？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And actually could you talk about that a little bit more from your perspective of thinking about the long-term health of the state of Alaska, the long-term health of the fund and so forth? How can either political elected leaders or people such as yourself whose job is to safeguard the fund for the long term for the benefit of the state of Alaska, you know, avoid essentially people eating the seedcore, right? Because that's what we're talking about, right? Of course, in an election year, everyone, Democrat or Republican, is going to be about protecting or expanding the dividend regardless of the performance, regardless of how big oil royalties are. How do you sort of keep, you know, I think there's versions of this debate that happen in DC. What is the discussions like to keep those choices essentially fiscally responsible for the long term?</p>
</details>

**Devin Mitchell:** 我认为任何金融系统所需的纪律是我们不断强调的。如果你们超出了我们尽最大可能确定的合理提取额——5%的历史提取额是一个合理的提取额，如果你们想确保未来有一个抗通胀的基金——那么，如果你们因为收益储备账户中有可用资金而偏离这个额度，那只是你们第一次超支，明年又会有另一个理由让你们超支，你们几乎是在确保这个系统会失败。我不断回到这个问题：这笔钱为什么会存在？它之所以存在，是因为在这一代阿拉斯加人之前，有50代阿拉斯加人没有花掉当年所有的收入。他们把一部分收入存了起来。他们这样做并不是为了2025年或2026年居住在阿拉斯加州的任何个人。他们是为了阿拉斯加州。这样阿拉斯加州才能拥有资源在未来生存下去。因此，过去几代阿拉斯加人的牺牲，确保了我们拥有这个令人难以置信的资源和收入来源，以便州政府不仅能提供服务。请记住，我们不仅仅是在争论学校资金、公共安全、道路和日常事务。我们正在争论要给我们的居民多少钱。是的。这是过去几代人给予这一代人如此令人难以置信的礼物。同样的礼物也需要为州的未来而保留。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the discipline that's required in any financial system is something that we circle around to continually that in the event that you exceed what we've determined to the best degree possible is a reasonable draw. the 5% historical draw is a reasonable draw. If you want to ensure that you have an inflation proof fund into the future that to the extent you deviate from that because there's available money in the stat in the earnings reserve account, that's just the first time that you're going to overspend and next year there's going to be another reason that you overspend and you're almost ensuring that the system's going to fail. And I I circle around to why does this money even exist? It exists because there were 50 generations of Alaskans before this generation that didn't spend all of the current year revenue that came in. They put some of that revenue aside. And they didn't do that for the benefit of any individual that was going to live in the state of Alaska in 2025 or 2026. They did it for the state of Alaska. So the state of Alaska would have the resources to survive into the future. And so that sacrifice of the past generations of Alaskans to ensure that we have this incredible resource and revenue source for the state to provide for not just services. Remember, we're not just arguing about school funding and public safety and roads and the normal things. We're arguing about how much money to give away. Yeah. That to to our residents. That that that's such an incredible gift that the past generations have given to this generation. And that same gift needs to be enshrined for the future of the state.</p>

### 石油收入下降与投资决策

**Tracy Alloway:** 马库斯，石油收入下降或石油业务的周期性波动如何影响你们的实际投资决策？你知道，如果原油价格下跌，那一年你们会投资风险更高、收益更高的东西吗？你们会以这种方式进行调整吗？

<p class="english-text">Marcus, how does declining oil revenue or just the cyclicality of the oil business feed into your actual investment decisions? You know, if the price of crude goes down, are is that a year where maybe you invest in riskier, higher yielding things, do you calibrate it in that way?</p>
</details>

**Marcus Frampton:** 是的，当然。目前，基金的特许权使用费收入每年不到10亿美元，而我们每年通过5%的提取额向州政府分配超过30亿美元。因此，石油价格的波动确实会影响我们的资金流入，但相对于基金的规模来说，影响非常微小。有时也有人争论我们是否应该投资石油和天然气，考虑到州政府的风险敞口。我们最终决定我们确实希望对石油和天然气投资有风险敞口。因此，在2020年和2021年这样的时期，我们倾向于投资能源、私募股权等。所以我们喜欢投资能源，但考虑到特许权使用费的规模，它对基金的现金流没有过大的影响。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah, sure. So, today the royalty income to the fund is less than a billion a year and we're dispersing over three billion a year to the state through the 5% draw. So, movements in oil do impact our inflows, but very marginally relative to the size of the fund. And there have been arguments at times of whether we should invest in oil and gas given the state's exposure. And we've ended up deciding that we do want exposure to oil and gas investments. And so in periods like 2020 and 2021 have leaned into energy, private equity, and things like that. So we like investing in energy, but it doesn't have a an outsized impact on the cash flows of the fund given the size of the royalties.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我对此非常感兴趣。你能多谈谈吗？因为我记得有时你会听到这些问题。金融界的人是否应该在他们的投资组合中持有银行股？有充分的理由说不，因为他们的职业生涯将与金融周期的周期挂钩，如果他们被解雇，那很可能是在银行股低迷的时候，等等。所以这是一个非常有趣的维度。你能多谈谈基金对能源的这种“双重风险敞口”的理由吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm actually really intrigued by that. Can you talk more about that? Cuz I remember sometimes you hear about these questions. Should people in finance have exposure to banks right in their portfolio? There's a good reason to say no because their career is going to be levered to the cycle of the financial cycle and if they get laid off, it's probably going to be at a time when bank stocks are low and so forth. So that's actually a very interesting dimension. Can you talk a little bit more about the reasoning for the sort of in a way double exposure to energy that the fund has? Yeah, I mean we feel like energy is</p>
</details>

**Marcus Frampton:** 是的，我的意思是，我们觉得能源是一个有吸引力的领域。许多投资者不想投资化石燃料，以至于即使在今天，我的意思是，在2021年，资本明显稀缺，当时有人评论说人们在10年内将不再使用化石燃料，这在我们看来显然与数据相矛盾。所以我们只是从机会主义的角度喜欢它。我的意思是，我认为它在**标准普尔500指数**（S&P 500: 由美国500家最大的上市公司股票组成的股票市场指数）和我们的私募股权基准中占的比例足够小，所以，你知道，如果指数是4%，我们是5%，这并不是一个过大的影响。我的意思是，你看到在谷歌工作的高科技人员，他们的整个投资组合都在科技股中，我会建议不要这样做，但我认为我们的规模是合理的，我们喜欢石油和天然气的未来前景。所以，我们在这方面很活跃。

<details>

<p class="english-text">an attractive area. So many investors don't want to be in fossil fuels that even today I mean in 2021 there was a clear scarcity of capital and there were comments being made that people weren't going to be using fossil fuels in 10 years which like clearly in our opinion contradicted the data. So we just liked it from an opportunistic standpoint. I mean, I think that it's a small enough portion of the S&P 500 and our private equity benchmark that, you know, if the index is at 4% and we're at five, it's it's not like an outsized impact. I mean, you see tech people that work at Google and their whole portfolios in in tech and I would advise against that, but I think our sizing is reasonable and we like the outlook for oil and gas. So, we're active there.</p>
</details>

**Devin Mitchell:** 只是为了让你们了解目前流入基金的特许权使用费的规模，过去10年的最高和最低值仅相差2亿美元。最低约为3.15亿美元，最高约为5.4亿美元。因此，与基金的收入和投资相比，这几乎是微不足道的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just to give you an idea of the magnitude of the royalties that are coming to the fund at this point, the high and the low over the last 10 years are only $200 million apart. 315ish for the low and 540ish for the high. And so in comparison to revenues and investments of the fund fairly inconsequential</p>
</details>

### 投资目标与本地偏好

**Tracy Alloway:** 除了产生回报并能够资助州政府和向公民支付一笔不错的奖金，这些本身就是两件大事。你们在投资方面还有其他目标吗？你们是否试图在阿拉斯加建设更多的基础设施？你们是否关注你们正在资助的具体项目？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">other than generating a return and being able to fund the state and pay out a nice bonus to citizens which you know in itself are two big things to be doing. Are there any other goals that you have in terms of investment? Are you trying to build out more infrastructure in Alaska? Are you conscious of the specific projects that you're funding?</p>
</details>

**Marcus Frampton:** 我们完全以财务视角进行投资，只有一个例外：有一条州法律或我们的法规规定，如果存在风险和回报相当的投资，我们应该优先选择阿拉斯加的投资。这很难衡量，比如如果你看股票市场，我认为只有一只股票**北岸银行**（Northrim Bank）是在交易所上市的阿拉斯加本地股票。所以，严格的解释是，我们必须将北岸银行与每一家社区银行进行比较。我喜欢北岸银行，我们也持有北岸银行的股票，但对于一家市值3亿美元的社区银行，你能持有的数量是有限的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We invest entirely with a financial lens and that was with the exception of one there's one state law that says if or in our regs that that say that if there's an investment of equivalent risk and return we should prefer the Alaskan investment. It's very difficult to measure that like if you look at the stock market I think there's one stock Northr Bank that's an Alaskanbased stock on an exchange. So, a strict interpretation would be that we have to like compare Northr Bank to every community bank. And I like Northr Bank and like we own stock at North Bank, but there's a limit to how much you can have in a 300 million market cap</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 社区银行。所以，它表现得相当不错。我刚刚查了一下图表。它是一家很小的银行，但看起来不错。反正……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">community bank. And so, it's done pretty well. I just pulled up the chart. It's a it's a pretty it's a small little bank, but it looks like this. It's a nice chart. Anyway,</p>
</details>

**Marcus Frampton:** 是的。我也有一个账户在那里。我喜欢北岸银行。所以，这并不是要诋毁北岸银行。我们喜欢北岸银行。但是，当阿拉斯加出现机会时，我们可能会比在其他州遇到随机机会时更频繁地关注。但我们的任务是追求最高的财务回报。我们的一些私募股权经理已经在州内完成了交易，我们在州内也有一些小的投资活动，但这就是我们整体的看法。再说一次，这又回到了发展基金模型与公共信托模型的争论。这是在1970年代，从76年到1980年发生的辩论。公共信托模型胜出，而不是我们打算把这笔钱投资在阿拉斯加并发展阿拉斯加。**艾伯塔遗产基金**（Alberta Heritage Fund: 加拿大艾伯塔省的主权财富基金，部分资金用于省内发展）实际上是一个很好的例子，可以说明如果它是一个发展模型，基金可能会如何表现。当你比较他们的基金表现与我们的基金表现时，从财务角度来看，阿拉斯加拥有公共信托并仅仅追求最佳投资（正如马库斯所描述的）无疑对阿拉斯加有利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah. And I have an account there. I like Northr Bank. But so, none of this is meant to denigrate North Bank. We love North Bank. But um so when there are opportunities in Alaska, we will take a look probably more frequently than we would if it was a random opportunity in another state. But our mandate is very much highest and best return financially. And some of our private equity managers have done deals in the state and we have some minor investment activity in the state, but that's the overall look that we take. And again, it goes back to the development fund model versus a public trust model. And that was the debate that happened in the 1970s from 76 to 1980. And the public trust model won rather than we're going to try to invest this money in Alaska and develop Alaska. Alberta Heritage Fund is actually a a good proxy for how you might expect a fund to have performed if it were a development model. And when you compare the performance of their fund relative to ours, it certainly financially is worked up worked out to Alaska's benefit to have the public trust and just looking for the best investment as Marcus described.</p>

### 私人资产市场展望

**Joe Weisenthal:** 马库斯，既然你在这里，你能告诉我们你对私人资产状况的看法吗？因为有两件事：第一，你总是听到这是私人信贷的黄金时代。我真的不知道那意味着什么。你只是总是听到私人信贷。但总的来说，对于私人资产，你听到，特别是在私募股权方面，也许在风险投资方面也听到，关于分配的稀缺等等，以及它们一直没有到来，以及对回报的质疑，比如你今天，2025年8月13日，你如何看待过去的业绩以及现在私人市场存在的机会？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Marcus, while we have you here, can you tell us a little bit about your sense of the state of private assets? Because two things, a you always hear it's the golden age of private credit. I don't really know what that means. You just hear about private credit all the time. But also with private assets in general, you hear particularly on the private equity side and maybe you hear it on the VC side too, the sort of posity of distributions and so forth and this idea that they haven't been coming and questions about returns like you sitting here on August 13th, 2025. How are you thinking about the past results but also opportunity set right now that exists in privates?</p>
</details>

**Marcus Frampton:** 是的，当然。我想说，总的来说，我对私人资产相当谨慎。我的意思是，我于2001年在**雷曼兄弟**（Lehman Brothers: 一家已倒闭的全球性金融服务公司，其破产是2008年金融危机的重要事件）开始我的职业生涯，我记得当时接受**杠杆收购**（LBO: Leveraged Buyout: 指通过大量借贷来收购一家公司，被收购公司的资产通常用作抵押）培训，你知道，你勾勒出典型的LBO，可能是息税折旧摊销前利润（EBIDA）的五六倍，杠杆率是三四倍，债务会偿还，到2000年代末，收购是EBIDA的八九倍，而现在平均美国中型市场收购的EBIDA**投资倍数**（EBITDA multiples: 企业价值与息税折旧摊销前利润的比率，常用于估值）是十几倍，而且大量资金已流入私人市场，所以我们从2010年到2020年受益于对私人市场的倾斜，我们只是在2021年觉得投资者不太可能获得回报溢价，我现在说的是私募股权，所以我们把对私募股权的承诺速度在2021年底削减了一半，并一直保持在这个水平，虽然略有提高，但我们仍然远低于五年前的部署水平。我们有私人信贷的配置。我认为这是我们定期辩论的事情，它可能占我们基金的4%。我认为，如果你看看中型市场直接贷款的无杠杆收益率与高收益或杠杆贷款相比，以及与五年前相比，我认为你今天可能获得100个**基点**（Basis Point: 衡量利率或百分比变化的基本单位，1个基点等于0.01%）的利差，而几年前是几百个基点。我的意思是，它不如以前有吸引力，这甚至无可辩驳。然后，如果你经历一个衰退周期、违约周期，我认为它将真正受到考验。所以我们在过去几年一直在对私人市场踩刹车，目前对前景相当谨慎。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, sure. I would say generally I'm quite cautious on privates. I mean I started my career at Lehman Brothers in ' 01 and I remember going through LBO training and you know you sketch out your typical LBO's maybe five six times EBIDA with three four times leverage and the debt pays down and by the end of the 2000s buyouts were 8 n times IBIDA and now on average US mid-market buyouts are mid- teens IBIDA multiples and a lot of money's gone into private so we're we benefited from leaning into privates from call it 2010 to 2020 and we just felt kind of in 2021 that it's unlikely that investors are going to get the return premium and I'm talking about private equity now so like we cut our commitment pace to private equity about in half in end of 2021 and we've kept it around there and ticked it up a little bit but we're still like well below where we were deploying 5 years ago. We have an allocation to private credit. I think that's something we debate regularly and it's maybe 4% of our fund. I think if you look at the unlevered yield on middle market direct lending versus high yield or levered loans versus where it was 5 years ago. I think maybe you're getting 100 basis point spread today versus several hundred a few years ago. I mean it's just not even debatable that it's less attractive than it was. And then if you go through a recession cycle, default cycle, I think it'll really get tested. So we're kind of been tapping the brakes on privates the last few years and are pretty cautious on the outlook right now.</p>
</details>

### 当前配置与宏观判断

**Tracy Alloway:** 你们今年在配置方面做了什么？因为“不确定性”这个词现在在对话中出现了很多次。政策存在不确定性，当然经济走向也存在不确定性。你们是更谨慎了，还是改变了你们传统的配置？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What have you been doing this year in terms of allocation because the word uncertainty seems to come up a lot in conversations nowadays. There's uncertainty over policy and of course uncertainty over the direction of the economy. Are you more cautious or are you I guess changing any of your traditional allocations?</p>
</details>

**Marcus Frampton:** 我认为现在是做出**宏观判断**（Macro Calls: 对经济或市场整体走势的预测）的非常困难的时期。我的意思是，你们有巨大的**财政赤字**（Budget Deficits: 政府支出超过收入的状况），短期内不会下降，而且明年**联邦基金利率**（Fed Funds Rate: 美国联邦储备银行设定的隔夜拆借利率目标）可能会随着新的美联储主席迅速下降。所以现在想要低配股票。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think right now is a really tough time to make like macro calls. I mean, you've got big budget deficits that aren't going to come down anytime soon and you probably have Fed funds coming down rapidly in the next year with a new Fed share. So to want to be like underweight equities right now.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 所以我们有点像紧跟基准，不想低配或超配股票，但市场就是很贵。所以，如果你没有利率下降的这种动态，我认为你现在会非常谨慎。但考虑到这个背景，你只能采取长远眼光，按照基准进行配置。正如我所说，在私人市场方面，我们肯定在踩刹车。我们每年都会部署资金，因为我们削减了部署速度，所以我们仍在部署，但只是少了很多。而且我们在私募股权投资组合中获得的分配和贡献更多，这很独特，也算是一种奢侈。所以即使我们与基准保持一致，我还是有点希望出现**资产错位**（Dislocation: 市场价格与基本面价值之间出现显著偏差的情况），因为我们通过减少私人市场部署速度，在流动性方面处于非常有利的位置。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So like we're kind of like hugging benchmarks on not wanting to be under or overweight equities, but it's just an expensive market. So if you didn't have that dynamic of rates coming down, you I think you'd want to be really cautious right now. But then given that backdrop, you kind of just have to take the long view, allocate in line with benchmarks. And like I said on privates, we're definitely tapping the brakes. We deploy every year and because we cut our pacing, we're still deploying, but just much less. And we're getting more in distributions and contributions on our private equity portfolio, which is unique and kind of a luxury. So even though we're kind of in line with our benchmarks, I sort of root for a dislocation because we're very well positioned from a liquidity standpoint with the reduced private pacing.</p>
</details>

### 基金的法律持久性

**Joe Weisenthal:** 德文，你能多谈谈基金的法律地位吗？阿拉斯加州宪法修正案确立了它。我必须想象，修正案对你们来说是一个非常法律上安全的保障。我不知道阿拉斯加的宪法程序，但宪法很难修改。但当你考虑超越你的任期，超越我们所有人的任期时，基金在法律上有多么持久？如果那些有进取心的政治家真的想改变基金的法律效力，那会有多难？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Devin, can you talk more about the sort of the legal status of the fund? Uh there was an amendment to the Alaska State Constitution that established it. I have to imagine that an amendment is like a very difficult is a very legally secure backing for you. I don't know the Alaska constitutional process, but constitutions are hard to change. But when you think about past your tenure, past all of our tenure, like how legally durable is the fund and how hard would it be? Yes, politicians are always going to one year try to give more away to the voters, etc. But how hard is it if enterprising politicians actually wanted to change the legal strength of the fund?</p>
</details>

**Devin Mitchell:** 想要以持久的方式改变基金的结构非常困难。从法律上讲，这并不难。那只需要州长同意的简单多数票，你就可以修改法规。创建永久基金之所以需要宪法修正案，是因为我们的宪法禁止专用收入。因此，为了获得专用收入承诺，必须进行修正案。这是压倒性的多数票。大约三分之二的州民投票支持。今天，将基金转变为我之前提到的真正的捐赠基金结构，采用5%的提取额，而不是我在收益储备中描述的噪音、提取失败的可能性、过度提取的可能性、通胀讨论以及代际契约讨论，我们确实需要一项宪法修正案才能达到那个目标。这将需要立法机构三分之二的投票，然后人民投票批准。由于我们已经有45年的人们获得分红，当他们想到永久基金时，他们不会真正考虑那些更大的问题。他们倾向于关注：“嘿，我去年收到了一张支票。我明年的支票会是多少？我的支票在哪里？为什么我的支票没有更大？为什么你们不遵循那个法定公式，我没有得到4000美元而不是1500美元？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's very difficult to change the structure of the fund in a durable way. Statutoily, it's not that difficult. The that's a simple majority in concurrence of the governor and you can change statutes. The reason it took a constitutional amendment to create the permanent fund is our constitution has a prohibition on dedication of revenues. And so in order to have a dedicated revenue pledge, there had to be an amendment. It was a overwhelming majority. It was just about twothirds of the people of the state voted for it. today. The idea of shifting the fund into what I alluded to earlier, a true endowment structure with a 5% draw rather than the noise that I described in the earnings reserve, the potential of a failed draw, the potential of an overdraw, the inflation discussion and the intergenerational compact discussion that that we really need a constitutional amendment to get to that point. And it would require a twothirds vote of the legislature and then a vote of the people to ratify it. And what quickly happens because we've had 45 years of people getting a dividend that when they think about the permanent fund, they don't really consider some of those larger issues. They tend to gravitate towards, hey, I got a check last year. What's my check going to be next year? Where's my check? How come my check's not bigger? How come you're not f following that statutory formula and I'm not getting four grand instead of 1,500?</p>
</details>

**Devin Mitchell:** 这就是人们正在进行的对话。一旦你深入了解，他们会说：“哦，哦，我明白了。它实际上是在资助我孩子的学校，或者它实际上是在保障我的道路安全。它现在正在做这些其他事情。”这就是教育过程一直以来的挑战。我们在两年一次的立法会议上取得了不错的进展。所以这是一个为期两年的会议，他们第一年开会，然后将这些法案延续到下一年。这是该会议的第二年。我们在上次会议上就宪法修正案的概念举行了多次听证会，而且……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's the conversation that people are having. And once you dive in, they go, "Oh, oh, I understand. It actually is funding my child's school or it's actually keeping me safe on the road. It's doing these other things at this point." And that's where that educational process is is has been the challenge. We have had decent traction in the we have a bianual legislative session. So a two-year uh session where they meet one year and then they carry forward those bills to the next. This is the second year of that session. We had a number of hearings last session on the concept of a constitutional amendment and there's</p>
</details>

**Devin Mitchell:** 我不知道，也许是五五开。也许我们能让立法机构考虑这样的事情的机会没那么好，因为你开篇讨论的“州的种子可能被吃掉”这个观点，我认为它吸引了右翼，而左翼喜欢确保每年都能为他们急需的项目或计划提供资金的想法。所以两者之间存在一种平衡。如何弥合分红问题，我认为是症结所在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know maybe it's a 5050. Maybe it's not quite that good shot that we'll be able to get the legislature to consider something like that because your your opening discussion about the seed corn of the state being potentially eaten that appeals to I think the right and the left likes the idea of making sure that you can fund your muchneeded project or programs every year. And so there's kind of a balance across the two. just how do you bridge that dividend question I think is the sticky wicket.</p>
</details>

### 分红的宏观经济与文化影响

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我不知道。我能想象，学校服务与购买新雪地摩托的首付，对一些阿拉斯加人来说可能是一个艰难的选择。但就此而言，我意识到这不一定是你们的专业领域，但你们是否注意到分红的任何宏观经济影响？或者更广泛的问题是，它如何融入阿拉斯加的整体文化？你知道，在分红发放的时候，你们是否开始看到关于如何花这笔额外资金的广告？它实际上如何影响阿拉斯加人的行为？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know. I could see school services versus down payment on a new snowmobile being a tough choice for some Alaskans. But on this note, I realize this isn't necessarily your wheelhouse, but do you notice any like macroeconomic impacts from the dividend? Or maybe a broader question would be how does it fit into Alaska's overall culture? You know, around dividend time, do you start to see advertisements for how to spend that extra money? How does it actually impact Alaskans behavior?</p>
</details>

**Devin Mitchell:** 哦，绝对有。你会看到，会有促销活动。服务阿拉斯加的航空公司都有永久基金分红促销。如果你在分红发放当天去好市多（Costco）购物，你将排很长时间的队。这对州经济绝对有影响，同样，用于州服务的转账也在州内循环。我的意思是，阿拉斯加的GDP仍然相对较小，它根据油价波动，每年400亿到700亿美元，所以当你把它与一些较大的州相比时，它相当小且高度集中。尽管从就业角度来看存在多样性，但从收入角度来看，仍然高度集中在石油和现在来自永久基金的投资收入。所以，考虑如果永久基金不存在，阿拉斯加会怎样，这很有趣。你刚才谈到人口萎缩，我认为这是由多种不同因素驱动的，其中一些是经济机会，也许与美国本土的经济机会更具可比性，而在某个时候，如果你搬到阿拉斯加，你期望赚的钱会比在美国本土赚的更多。我有一个以前一起工作的朋友，他搬到阿拉斯加在**通加斯国家森林**（Tongas National Forest: 位于阿拉斯加东南部的美国最大国家森林）当伐木工人。他说他一个月赚的钱足以买一辆全新的皮卡车。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, absolutely. You see, there will be sales. The airlines that serve Alaska all have permanent fund dividend sales. you have if you go buy a Costco on the day that dividends are distributed you will be waiting in line a long time there there is absolutely an economic impact on the state and similarly from the the transfer that's used for state services that cycles within the state as well I mean Alaska still has a relatively small GDP it vacasillates based on the price of oil but 40 to 70 billion a year and so when you compare that to some of the larger states, it's pretty pretty small and fairly concentrated. Even though there's diversity from an employment perspective, from a revenue perspective, still a lot of concentration in oil and now investment income from the permanent fund. And so it's interesting to consider if the permanent fund didn't exist. Alaska, you were talking about a shrinking population and I think that's driven by a number of different factors, some of which are economic opportunities, maybe being more comparable to what they are in the continental US where at one point if you moved to Alaska, you expected to make more than you would make in the continental US. I have a guy that I used to work with, he moved to Alaska to to work in the Tongas National Forest as a logger. He said that he made enough money in one month to buy a brand new pickup truck.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 哇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow.</p>
</details>

**Devin Mitchell:** 所以你现在想想，你需要工作多少个月才能买一辆全新的皮卡车，而他当时一个月就能赚到，你知道，假设那不是一辆很好的四驱皮卡，5万美元。现在的工资已经不一样了。当然，阿拉斯加也不再有那种工业规模的伐木业了。但即使是斜坡工人，一个月也赚不到5万美元。所以当你看看经济中的其他部门，虽然有一些亮点，但肯定也有一些挣扎。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so you you think about today and how many months you have to work to buy a brand new pickup truck and he would be making, you know, let's say it's a not that nice of four-wheel drive pickup. $50,000 he made that month, which wages aren't the same. And of course, logging isn't happening on that industrial scale in Alaska anymore either. But even a slope worker is not making $50,000 a month. And so when when you look at some of the other sectors in the economy that there are bright spots but certainly there's some struggles as well</p>
</details>

### 阿拉斯加的未来经济前景

**Tracy Alloway:** 还有一个问题，我想这有点展望未来，再次强调，这不一定是基金的专业领域，但只是思考阿拉斯加的经济。当我们在那里时，我们听到了几种不同的说法，比如，好的，你们正在谈论石油特许权使用费的总体长期下降。我们听到有人说，也许阿拉斯加有一天可以成为一个氢能中心，那里有很多机会可以利用太阳能、风能和波浪能将水转化为氢气，这可能成为阿拉斯加州的一个新机遇。我知道有人谈论也许有一天阿拉斯加可以成为数据中心的重要目的地，因为你可以在寒冷的气候下建造它们，从而节省冷却成本等等。当你思考阿拉斯加州或基金的未来时，你们是否会尝试思考阿拉斯加经济在未来10年、20年可能出现的积极上行情景？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">is another question I guess it's sort of looking forward and again not necess necessarily the wheelhouse of the fund per se, but just thinking about the economy of Alaska. When we were there, we heard a couple different things like, okay, so you're talking about the oil royalties in general, like sort of long-term decline. We heard someone talk about, well, maybe like Alaska could one day be a hydrogen hub, that there's a lot of opportunity to harness solar and wind and wave power to turn water into hydrogen, and that could be a new boon for the state of Alaska. I know there's talk maybe one day Alaska could be a important destination for data centers because you could save on cooling costs by just constructing them in a cold climate etc. When you think about either the state of Alaska or the future of the fund, do you try to think about possible right tail upside scenarios for what the economy of Alaska could look like 10, 20 years down the road?</p>
</details>

**Devin Mitchell:** 从基金的角度来看，我们倾向于只关注机构投资。从阿拉斯加的政策角度来看，这些显然都是非常有趣的事情。当你思考阿拉斯加时，再说一次，它是一个巨大的州，面积达58.6万平方英里。所以你可以把阿拉斯加分成两半，让德克萨斯州成为第三大州。它太大了。人们，你知道……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">From the funds perspective, we tend to just focus on institutional investing. From the policy Alaska perspective, those are obviously all very interesting things to consider. And when you're thinking about Alaska, and again, it's a huge state, 586,000 square miles. And so it you can cut Alaska in half and make Texas the third largest state. It's huge. It's people, you know,</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 每个人都用德克萨斯州的数量来衡量阿拉斯加。是的。德克萨斯州也对其他州这样做。所以这是一个俄罗斯套娃般的州，它们都在炫耀自己的平方英里数。反正，继续说。但我可能有点防御性，因为阿拉斯加在大多数地图上都以不同的比例显示。我们在太平洋上，看起来只有德克萨斯州的一半大小，所以也许这就是这种强调的原因。但从资源开发的角度来看，以及开放的天空，如果有人需要空间，阿拉斯加有令人难以置信的空间。显然，我们有很多美丽的空间，在国家和州层面都受到保护，以造福后代，但也有很多土地可用于其他用途。因此，当这些想法出现并具有经济意义时，我认为这对阿拉斯加来说是关键的障碍，那就是我们历史上一直梦想远大，州政府也有足够的收入、盈余收入来尝试刺激经济发展。事实证明，政府很难……

<p class="english-text">everyone measures Alaska in number of Texas. Yeah. And Texas do that to the other states, too. So it's this Russian nesting doll of states lording over lording their square miles over other states. Anyway, keep going. But I it's maybe we're a little defensive because Alaska is on a different scale on most maps. We're out in the Pacific Ocean and it looks like we're about half the size of Texas and so perhaps that's what drives that that emphasis. But certainly from a resource development perspective and the open skies are like if somebody needed space, there's incredible spaces in Alaska. Obviously, we have a lot of beautiful spaces that that are protected for both at the national and state level for future generations, but there's a lot of land that's available for other uses. And so as those ideas come along and they make economic sense, I think that's the critical hurdle for Alaska is that we have historically dreamed big and the states had enough revenue, surplus revenue to make attempts at at stimulating economic development. And it's proven to be very difficult for a government to</p>

**Devin Mitchell:** 强制经济发展。它必须更自然地发生。因此，当人们认识到阿拉斯加所代表的优势，也许距离不再那么重要，因为卫星通信或其他技术使得信息从其他地方无缝传递，就像你说的，低成本能源与寒冷气候相结合，可能会导致数据中心开发趋势。但我认为所有这些都还有待观察。从我们的角度来看，我们会支持，但我们只会专注于投资资金。

<p class="english-text">to force economic development. It has to happen more organically. And so as people recognize the strengths that Alaska represents and maybe there's the distances don't make as big a difference because of satellite communications or other technologies that make the delivery of information seamless from other locations and like you said then that with lowcost energy combined with colder climate could result in a data center development trend. But I think all of it's a little we're going to wait and see at this point. Be supportive from our perspective, but we're just going to focus on investing money.</p>

### 流动性溢价与市场错位

**Marcus Frampton:** 马库斯，我想再回到私人信贷一秒钟，因为你说的你自2020年以来已经减少了风险敞口，这让我觉得非常有趣。你知道，许多大型基金，许多捐赠基金会争辩说，他们的竞争优势之一是他们可以买入并持有非流动性投资，因为他们不一定面临像共同基金或类似基金那样的资金流出压力。你们实际上如何使用或部署你们的非**流动性溢价**（Illiquidity Premium: 投资者因持有难以迅速变现的资产而获得的额外回报）？这是你们会考虑的事情吗？如果你们不在私人信贷中这样做，你们是否在浪费这种竞争优势？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Marcus, I want to go back to private credit for one second because I found what you were saying really interesting that you've dialed down your exposure since 2020. You know, a lot of big funds out there, a lot of endowments would argue that one of their competitive advantages is that they can buy and hold ill liquid investments because they don't necessarily face the same outflow pressures as say a mutual fund or someone like that. How do you actually use your or deploy your I guess illiquidity premium? Is that something you think about? And if you're not doing it in private credit, are you sort of letting that competitive advantage go to waste?</p>
</details>

**Marcus Frampton:** 我不认为这是一种你得到的非流动性溢价。我认为这是一种你必须要求的非流动性溢价。我的意思是，在私人信贷方面，我们的配置大致保持不变。我们只是承诺的资金少了。所以，在整个行业中，你也看到投资者现在超出了他们的目标配置，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think of it as like an illquidity premium that you get. I think it's an ili liquidity premium that you have to demand. I mean like in private credit our allocation has stayed roughly the same. We've just committed less. And so across and private equity too and across the industry you see investors that are over their target allocation now, right?</p>
</details>

**Marcus Frampton:** 他们未来可能不得不降低部署速度。所以我感觉，如果你看看私人信贷，过去5年，在不调整违约的情况下，你获得的非流动性溢价已经下降了。所以我们对此的热情降低了。如果你调整违约，你今天在私募股权和私人信贷中甚至可能没有获得溢价。这就像一场辩论，你是否获得了适当的非流动性溢价？所以我认为这就像是“养精蓄锐”，等待一个不同的环境，那里有真正的机会主义情况，你可以要求非常高的回报溢价，以锁定你的资金10年。我不认为这是一种市场现象，在不同的市场中，你甚至可能得不到非流动性溢价，我们现在可能接近那种情况，在这些情况下，流动性应该被重视，我认为现在流动性应该被重视，而10年前，那是一个真正引人注目的环境，可以获取流动性溢价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And they may in the future have to reduce down their pacing. And so I feel like if you look at private credit, the illiquidity premium that you're getting without adjusting for defaults has declined in the last 5 years. And so we've been less enthusiastic about it. And if you adjust for defaults, you may not even be getting a premium in private equity and private credit today. It's like a debate like are you getting an appropriate illquidity premium? So I think of it as kind of like keeping our powder dry for a different environment where there is real opportunistic situations that you can demand a very high return premium for locking up your money for 10 years. I don't think it's like I I think it's a market thing that in different markets you may not even get an ill liquidity premium and we may be close to that now and in those situations liquidity should be valued and I think liquidity should be valued now whereas 10 years ago it was a real compelling environment for uh harvesting liquidity premium.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的，你之前提到过这个想法，你希望出现某种**市场错位**（Dislocation: 市场价格与基本面价值之间出现显著偏差的情况）来加以利用，我们是记者。我们喜欢事情发生，这样我们就有大量的话题可以谈论和撰写。但是你在这里设想的是什么样的错位呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, you kind of touched on this earlier the idea that you're hoping for some sort of dislocation to take advantage of which we're journalists. We like it when stuff happens and we have a lot to talk and write about. But what dislocation are you sort of envisioning here?</p>
</details>

**Marcus Frampton:** 嗯，这取决于资产类别。我的意思是，在固定收益方面，例如，我们长期以来一直保持非常紧密的利差，我们的固定收益团队有点只是想避免麻烦。如果你看看像四月这样的月份，市场在前两天就下跌了10%以上。大多数养老基金和捐赠基金每月进行再平衡，因为我们的基准每月进行再平衡。我们决定我们只是忽略这一点。所以我们积极地“逢低买入”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it depends on the asset class. I mean, in fixed income, for example, we've had like very tight spreads for a very long time and our fixed income team is kind of just trying to stay out of trouble. If you look at a month like April, the first two days the market was down over 10%. Most pension funds and endowments rebalance monthly because our benchmarks rebalance monthly. We've decided that we just are going to ignore that. And so we like bought the dip aggressive.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 恭喜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Congratulations.</p>
</details>

**Marcus Frampton:** 然后它如此短暂，以至于在业绩中只是一个小小的波动。但我的意思是，我认为私募股权可能潜藏着麻烦。商业房地产可能潜藏着麻烦。我不知道私人信贷会怎样。我并不是说它会走向灾难。我只是认为你没有获得一个真正引人注目的溢价来锁定你的资金。但在那些可能出现错位的领域，比如私募股权或商业房地产，我们希望在错位时成为拥有雄厚资金的买家，当你环顾整个行业时，那些超配私募股权的人，我认为他们会发现自己没有那种奢侈，而我们希望拥有那种奢侈，你知道，一个周期会到来。它可能不会是明年，因为利率正在下降。或者也许会是，因为没有人认为会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then it was so it was so brief that it's a blip in the performance. But I mean I think that there's could be trouble lurking in private equity. There could be trouble lurking in commercial real estate. I don't know on private credit. I'm not like making a call that it's headed for disaster. I just don't think you're getting a real compelling premium for locking up your money. But in some of those areas that could get dislocated like private equity or commercial real estate like we want to be the the buyer with deep pockets in a dislocation and when you look around the industry people that are overallocated to private equity I think will find that they don't have that luxury and like we want to have that luxury you know and a cycle will come. It may not be. It probably will not be next year with rates coming down. Or maybe it will be because no one thinks it will.</p>

### 基金经理的会面方式与自然资源投资

**Tracy Alloway:** 我有一个非常简短的问题，然后是一个真正的问题。简短的问题是，如果有一些另类基金经理，他们必须飞到朱诺来见你们，还是你们去美国本土48州，或者这些介绍是如何进行的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I have a real short question then a real question. The short question is if there's some manager alt manager of any sort, do they have to fly to Juno and meet you or do you go to the lower 48 or how does that how do those introductions work?</p>
</details>

**Marcus Frampton:** 是的，大约10年前我刚来这里工作时，我们正在大力发展私人市场，我们有一个想法，我们应该“考验”经理人，他们不仅应该来，还应该在一月份来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, when I started here about 10 years ago, we were really building out private markets and we had this idea that we should kind of haze managers and not only should they come out, they should come out in January and</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 并且乘坐冰川巡游，伴随着巨浪。反正……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and do a glacier cruise with high uh high waves. Anyway,</p>
</details>

**Marcus Frampton:** 当我们开始尝试进入真正的顶级风险投资基金等时，我们意识到那不是一个好的模式。所以，我们一直在使用我们的阿拉斯加航空里程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when we started trying to get into the real Premier Venture funds and stuff, we realized that was not a good model. So, we've we've been using our Alaska Air miles.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 好的，真正的问题。这是我的最后一个问题。我之所以提出这个问题，是因为你提到了伐木业，以及你之前提到了石油。著名的**戴维·斯文森**（David Swenson: 耶鲁大学捐赠基金的传奇首席投资官）在耶鲁大学将木材配置作为其投资组合的核心部分。人们普遍认为，像这样的**自然资源**（Natural Resources: 存在于自然界中，可被人类利用的资源，如石油、木材、矿产）投资可以发挥良好的多元化作用，它们在某些方面具有周期性，并且在捐赠基金环境中非常自然。你们身处一个资源开采州，所以我很好奇，撇开你提到的石油问题，以及2021年可能没有足够的资本投入，你对现代资源行业是否仍然能在长期投资组合中发挥作用有什么看法？它们是否能提供不一定与“风险资产”当年表现一致的回报？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, real question. This is the last thing for me. So it occurred to me and I bring this up because of the mention of logging and your mention of oil earlier. Famously David Swintson at Yale made timber allocation part a core part of his portfolio. And there's all this thinking that like natural resource envir investments like that could play a good diversifying role that they were sort of as cyclical in certain ways and they're very natural in the endowment setting. you're in a resource extraction state and so I'm curious if you have any thoughts today setting aside the point you made about oil and maybe there was s not enough capital exposed to it in 2021 whether you have any thoughts about in the modern era do resource industries can they still play that role in a long-term portfolio where they deliver returns that aren't necessarily in line with what like quote risky assets are doing in a given year?</p>
</details>

**Marcus Frampton:** 哦，我认为是这样。我认为**商品**（Commodities: 可互换的原材料或初级农产品，如石油、黄金、谷物）和资源一直是一个有趣的领域，但就像我最喜欢的投资名言之一是**巴顿·比格斯**（Barton Biggs: 摩根士丹利前首席全球策略师）的名言，他说没有一个投资理念是如此之好，以至于过多的资本无法摧毁它或毁掉所有人的机会。戴维·斯文森公开做任何事情后，通常很多人都会效仿他，所以木材投资变得不再那么有趣。但我的意思是，我认为资源开发和采矿是过去十年在美国至少投资不足的领域。所以我的意思是，这对我们的一些私人市场经理来说是一个非常有趣的领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, I think so. I think commodities and resources have always been an interesting area to look, but like one of my favorite investment quotes is Barton Big's quote that there's no investment idea that's so good that too much capital can't destroy it or ruin it for everyone. And that was definitely the case like once David Swenson publicly did anything usually a lot of people followed him and so timber kind of got uninteresting but I mean I think resource development mining are areas that have been like underinvested in in the United States at least the last decade. So I mean that's a that's a real interesting area for some of our private market managers.</p>

### 对美国联邦主权财富基金的建议

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我还有一个问题，我正在看白宫网站。现在我正在看一个页面，上面写着“建立美国主权财富基金的计划”。正如我们一开始讨论的，谁知道这是否真的会发生，但肯定有一些讨论。如果美国在联邦层面建立一个主权财富基金（SWF），你们对这种级别的基金有什么建议？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have one more question which is I am looking at the White House website right now. Now I'm looking at a page that says a plan for establishing a United States sovereign wealth fund. And as we discussed in the beginning, who knows if that's actually going to happen, but certainly there are some discussions around it. If the US at a federal level were to establish a sovereign wealth fund, an SWF, what advice would you have for something at that level?</p>
</details>

**Marcus Frampton:** 嗯，我的意思是，我认为建立一个具有明确**规则化投资政策**（Rules-based Investment Policy: 遵循预设规则和标准的投资策略，以减少主观判断和政治干预）的基金非常有意义。我的意思是，任何时候你投资公共资金，最重要的事情之一就是获得公民的信任，你的利益相关者对你如何做出投资决策，你如何进行尽职调查，你如何构建投资组合的信任。所以我鼓励他们考虑这样一个事实，即它很可能会超越本届政府，延续到未来的政府，并且拥有真正深思熟虑的治理、投资委员会流程等。我不知道。德文，你有什么要补充的吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I I mean I think setting up something with like clear rulesbased investment policy makes a lot of sense. I mean, anytime you're investing public funds, like one of the most important things to do is to get the trust of the citizenry, the your stakeholders in how you're making investment decisions, how you do due diligence, how you build a portfolio. So I would encourage them to think about the fact that it will likely live beyond the current administration to future administrations and just have real thoughtful governance investment committee process things like that. I don't know. Do you have anything Deon?</p>
</details>

**Devin Mitchell:** 我的想法也是如此。我可能会补充一点，当这个想法最初出现时，从个人角度来看，我有点难以理解为什么我们会在一个**经常性财政赤字**（Recurring Fiscal Deficit: 政府支出持续超过收入的状况）的情况下这样做。大多数主权财富基金存在的理由，或者说所有主权财富基金存在的理由，都是因为有**意外之财收入**（Windfall Revenue: 因意想不到的事件或情况而获得的巨额收入），

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Those were my thoughts as well. I might layer on I it's when the idea initially came out just from a personal perspective. I had a little bit of uh hard time understanding why we would be doing that when we're in a a recurring fiscal deficit situation. The reason that most sovereign wealth funds exist or maybe all is that there's windfall revenue y</p>
</details>

**Devin Mitchell:** 正如我之前所说，人们有一个愿景，即从一次性收入来源中永久地为他们的居民提供福利。因此，如果国家层面出现类似的情况，那可能是有意义的。但我想，你希望你有一个平衡的预算。你会有一些方法论，说明为什么你会在预算不平衡的情况下追求创建一个主权财富基金。是的，不过看起来全世界的主权财富基金都经常与石油相关，也经常与经济规模太小，无法在短时间内部署资金而不造成大量浪费或通胀的经济体相关。总之，德文和马库斯，这次对话非常精彩，非常感谢你们两位来到“Odd Lots”。我认为这是一个很多人都非常好奇的话题，非常感谢你们抽出时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that shows up that people like I said earlier have a vision of providing for their residents in perpetuity from a one-time revenue source. And so if there were something along that line that showed up at the national level, it might make some sense. But you would, I think, hope that you had a balanced budget. You would have some methodology for why you would be pursuing creating a sovereign wealth fund despite having a budget that was in imbalance. Yeah, it definitely seems though all around the world if you look at sovereign wealth funds they frequently associated with oil oil and frequently associated with economies that are too small for the money to be deployed in a short period of time without creating a lot of waste or inflation. Anyway, fascinating conversation Devon and Marcus, thank you both so much for coming on OddLots. I think a conversation a lot of people are very curious about and uh really appreciate you both taking your time.</p>

### 播客总结与反思

**Tracy Alloway:** 特蕾西，我喜欢这次对话。首先，我很高兴我们在从阿拉斯加回来之后才进行这次对话，因为我感觉，了解阿拉斯加是一个多么独特的经济体，阿拉斯加经济的具体需求等等，以及它那种奇怪的繁荣与萧条的暴露，以及一个如此偏远的经济体是否能够自给自足，这让我对为什么一个州会拥有相当于主权财富基金的东西，或者为什么它会拥有相当于小额**通用基本收入**（Universal Basic Income, UBI: 政府定期向所有公民无条件支付的收入）的东西有了更深刻的理解。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tracy, I love that conversation. First of all, I I'm glad we did that after after we had returned from Alaska cuz I just felt like understanding just what a distinct economy is Alaska is and the specific needs of the Alaskan economy, etc., and the sort of weirdness and the exposure to booms and busts and whether an economy that far-flung can even like support itself like gives me a deeper understanding of like why a state would have the equivalent of a sovereign wealth fund or why it would have the equivalent of like a a small like little universal basic income.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 是的。嗯，就此而言，我确实认为当我们问他们对联邦主权财富基金有什么建议时，他们说了一些基于规则的东西，这很有趣。是的，你知道，你坚持一个特定的支付公式，以使基金免受政治反复无常的影响，而政治反复无常是中期变化的。我想我发现那真的很有趣，它也让我想起了我们与**克劳迪娅·萨姆**（Claudia Sahm: 一位美国经济学家，曾任美联储高级经济学家）关于**萨姆法则**（Sahm Rule: 一项经济指标，用于预测经济衰退的开始）的对话，以及为什么你需要这些基于规则的经济公式或刺激公式，是为了使它们免受政治风险的影响。我觉得那很有趣。我还认为，我的意思是，听起来在阿拉斯加基金担任投资组合经理会是一份不错的工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Well, on that note, I did think it was interesting when we asked about what would their advice be for a federal sovereign wealth fund and they said something rules-based. Yes. where you, you know, you stick to a certain payout formula in order to insulate the fund from political whims which change on a sort of midterm basis. I suppose I thought that was really interesting and it also reminded me actually of the conversations we had with Claudia S about the SA rule and the idea that like one of the reasons you want these rules-based economic formulas is in order to or stimulus formulas is to insulate them from political risk. Thought that was interesting. I also thought I mean it sounds like being a portfolio manager at the Alaska Fund would be like a nice job I think.</p>

**Tracy Alloway:** 我还没有经历过阿拉斯加的冬天，所以我高度怀疑如果我在一月份而不是八月份在那里，我对居住在这个州的看法会发生剧烈变化。我能说一些不打算冒犯任何住在那里的人或我们请来的任何一位杰出嘉宾的话吗？

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 绝对不是为了冒犯任何人。是的。任何住在阿拉斯加的人？安克雷奇有很多酒吧。有很多潜水酒吧。我感觉有一个原因，我没有。是的，那也是。我怀疑所有这些酒吧和大约8个月的时间里，太阳在上午11点升起，下午4点落下，这两者之间存在联系。
