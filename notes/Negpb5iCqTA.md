### 科学思维与不确定世界

大家好，欢迎收听“In Good Company”。我是**挪威主权财富基金**（Norwegian S wealth fund: 挪威政府运营的全球最大主权财富基金之一）的首席执行官**尼古拉·坦根**（Nicolola Tangan）。今天，我很荣幸能与**索尔·佩尔穆特**（Saul Perlmutter）共度时光，他无疑是我们播客有史以来最聪明的人。**索尔**因发现宇宙正在以越来越快的速度膨胀而荣获**诺贝尔物理学奖**。他还撰写了一本名为《**第三千年思维**》（Third Millennium Thinking）的书，教导我们如何运用科学方法来驾驭这个日益不确定的世界。非常欢迎您来到我们的播客。

Hi everybody and welcome to in good company. I'm Nicolola Tangan the CEO of the Norwegian S wealth fund and today I'm in particularly good company with Saul Pearlmter who I would argue easily is the cleverest person we ever had on the podcast because Soul won the Nobel Prize in physics for discovering that the universe expands at an increasingly rapid pace. Now you also written a book called Third Millennium Thinking which teaches us how to use scientific method in order to navigate this increasingly uncertain world. So big welcome to to this podcast.

>> Thank you. It's good to be here.

### 第三千年思维的核心

**佩尔穆特**解释说，“**第三千年思维**”这个名字有些特别，它旨在捕捉科学思维的最佳风格如何帮助整个社会更好地共同解决问题。我们希望阐明这种思维方式的真正面貌，以便人们能够意识到，其中的许多元素都可以在日常生活中使用，也可以在与他人交流和共同解决问题时运用。在某种意义上，我们已经学会了如何解决世界上真正重大、困难和有趣的问题。他认为，唯一尚未解决但能带来巨大改变的问题，就是我们如何相互交流、共同解决问题，从而真正运用我们所学到的所有其他技术。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> I thought we could start with the book and kind of the scientific thinking. So what is third millennium thinking? Well, it's a bit of a of a odd name because what we really want to capture is the direction in which we think the best of our scientific style of thinking has been helping our whole society uh be able to do better in working through problems together. And we want to try to capture what does that really look like so that people um can realize that there's so many elements of it they could all be using in their daily life and also they could be using when they're talking to other people and working out problems together. M

>> and uh in some sense I'd say that we've learned by now how to solve really dramatic problems and and difficult problems and interesting problems in the world. The one that I feel is the leftover problem that we can make a huge difference if we can solve is just how to talk to each other, how to work problems out together so that we can actually use all these other techniques that we've learned
</details>

### 解决全球性挑战的潜力与障碍

**佩尔穆特**指出，我们生活在一个历史和宇宙史上都前所未有的时刻，我们是地球上第一批有能力解决全球规模问题的世代。例如，我们知道如何应对流行病；尽管地球人口比我们童年时增加了数十亿，但挨饿的人口比例已大大降低，我们知道如何养活地球。我们甚至知道如何稳定气候，而历史上气候变化曾多次摧毁文明。此外，我们甚至有能力应对彗星或小行星撞击地球的威胁，这曾导致地球上大多数物种家族灭绝。这是一个令人难以置信的起点，意味着我们本应能够共同建设一个我们都引以为傲的星球。然而，恰恰在这个关键时刻，我们在相互沟通和有效协作方面遇到了困难。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> because the first time I met when we when we spoke you said uh you know Nikolai we can now solve all the problems in the world uh you know climate how to feed people but we don't manage to because we don't talk to each other. I mean it's remarkable. I think we actually live at a incredible moment in in history and prehistory and uh and in fact you know maybe even cosmic history um where we are the first generations on this planet um who have the ability to solve planetary sized problems. I think you know the uh the idea that there could be a pandemic and we actually know what to do about a pandemic. Um, we have billions of people living on the on the planet, many more than when we were children. And we at the time when we were children, most of the world was going to bed hungry. Today, that's a very small percentage. And we've we now know how it's possible to feed a planet. Uh, we can even handle things like, you know, climate changes that have happened throughout history have wiped out civilizations at different points in different ways. Today, for the very first time ever, we know how you could stabilize a a climate. Um, and that we can actually manage that. We could even manage the uh the, you know, the thing that killed the dinosaurs, the the you know, possibility of a comet or asteroid hitting the earth. And and that one wiped out, you know, most of the families of species on the planet. That's something even that we have the possibility of of being able to solve that problem.

>> That's a pretty pretty pretty incredible starting point, right? So it seems like the one thing that we should all be enjoying today if we had had that a moment to just to breathe and ask each other what is the world that we want to live in this would be the moment where we could all be saying you know turn to each other and saying okay now finally we can build a planet that we just all be proud to live in and at that very moment we're having a hard time

>> interacting with each other and communicating well enough in a productive way so that we can do these work.

### 科学方法：概率思维的力量

**佩尔穆特**解释说，当我们谈论**科学方法**（Scientific Method: 科学家探索自然现象和获取知识的系统性过程）时，它不仅仅是学校里教授的假设检验。它是一整套思想的集合，共同构成了一种思考世界的方式。这包括**概率思维**（Probabilistic Thinking: 认识到事物并非绝对真或假，而是以不同概率存在的思维方式）。我们很少能绝对确定某事是真或假。通常，我们只是强烈地感觉到某事很可能是真的，或者我们愿意用生命去赌它为真，而另一些事情则不确定。这种区分非常有用，它不是非黑即白的“是”或“否”。例如，我们可能对某事有90%的把握，而对另一件事只有70%的把握。这种思维方式赋予我们强大的力量，因为事实证明，通过这种方式，我们能比仅仅区分“绝对已知”或“绝对未知”做更多的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> So what is a scientific method? It's a so when you say the scientific method I mean often many of us have been taught something called the scientific method in in in school which was just this hypothesis testing concept. Um but that's just one piece of this whole culture of a grabag of a whole bunch of different ideas that together make a an approach to think about the world. It includes things like thinking of the world probabilistically that um we don't tend to know we very rarely know anything absolutely true or absolutely false. Generally, we have a fairly strong sense that this is very likely to be true. Something else we would bet our lives on being true. Something else we're not sure is true. And that's actually a very useful differentiation. It's not uh black and white, yes or no. It's this one I'm going to bet 90% on, but this one I'm only going to give, you know, 70% uh bet on. And that makes us very powerful. It turns out we actually can do a lot more that way than than in just saying absolutely known or absolutely unknown. How do you think about your life in probabilistic terms?
</details>

### 日常生活中的概率决策

在我们的日常生活中，**概率思维**无处不在。有些决策我们已经习以为常，比如判断过马路是否安全，我们在这方面做得很好。另一些时候，我们被迫认真思考，例如在做出医疗保健决策时：是否应该服用某种药物？是否应该接受某种手术？在这些情况下，我们必须仔细权衡各种可能性和风险。这些是我们能清楚认识到的决策，但它也隐藏在我们许多其他的日常活动中。当我们作为一个群体做出决策时，我们通常不会记住这一点，也不会记住我们应该利用这种方式来避免过度执着于争论的任何部分，而是愿意考虑“我可能是错的”。例如，我可能有75%到80%的把握我是对的，但也有25%的几率我是错的，在这种情况下，也许你的观点才是正确的。这使得讨论更加流畅，也使得团队在不执着于自己立场的情况下，更容易共同解决问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Well, in our day-to-day lives, it comes up all the time. Uh we are having to make you know, well, some of them we just are we're very used to. We we make a bet on whether it's safe to cross the street and and you know, we are pretty good at that. Um some of them we occasionally are forced to think very hard about when we have to make a health care decision. So, you know, should you uh take this medicine? Should you uh you know, people have to decide whether to get a certain operation. um those you actually have to think through very carefully what the odds are and what the what the uh but and how much you should risk but those are things that we I think would so recognize that we do but it is hidden in many many of the other just day-to-day activities that we do and when we make decisions as a group we don't usually remember that and we don't remember that actually we should be using this as a way of not getting overly attached to any part of the of the argument but being willing to consider well I could be wrong I mean 75% 80% sure I'm right but there's 25% odds that I'm wrong in this one if in which case maybe your point might be the right point in this particular discussion and uh and it makes it a much more of a fluid discussion much more possible for groups to think through problems in a without being attached to the to their position
</details>

### 个人谦逊与集体傲慢

**佩尔穆特**谈到了**个人谦逊**（Individual Humility: 承认自己可能犯错并愿意接受批评的态度）和**集体傲慢**（Collective Arrogance: 团队坚信能够解决看似不可能的问题并坚持不懈的信念）。作为科学家，我们所做的大部分成功工作都源于考虑我们可能犯错的可能性。实验科学家95%的时间都在寻找实验中、理论中的错误。大多数测量都存在误差，我们必须弄清楚可接受的误差范围。但我们真正希望的是在基本理论中发现错误。例如，当我们发现对引力的理解有误时，那是非常令人兴奋的，这也是**爱因斯坦**（Albert Einstein）成名的原因之一。大多数科学家都在不断探索和突破我们自认为确定的边界，思考如果世界与我们想象的有所不同，那将是多么令人惊奇。这正是我们力量的来源——不断质疑的能力。虽然怀疑听起来像是弱点，但事实证明，这正是我们的**超能力**（Superpower: 卓越的能力或优势）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> you talk about something called individual humility and collective arrogance what do you mean by that

>> so the these parts of the story where you uh need to be able to understand that most of what we did as scientists that was has been has made successful is to consider the possibility that we're making a mistake and that we're getting something wrong. And that is probably 95% of an experimental scientist's life is looking for where are the mistakes this time in in the experiment they're running in the uh in the um theory that they're working with. Um if they're day-to-day, you know, most measurements have some error to them. You have to figure out what the amount of error is that's that is permissible for the particular measurement you're making. Um but and that's part of the mistakes that are there in front of you. what you're really looking for is you're really hoping you find mistakes in the fundamental theories that you're working with. So if when you find out there's something wrong with our understanding of gravity, that was really exciting. Um and that was, you know, what what made Einstein uh you know, one of the things that made him famous. Um and and most scientists, they're constantly trying to figure out and push the edges of what is it that we are fairly sure about, but what things would we be would be amazing if it turned out that the world was a little bit different than we thought. And that is actually where our strength comes from, that ability to be constantly questioning. Um, and it sounds like a weakness to always be doubting, but it it turns out I think that's really where our superpower lies.
</details>

### 团队协作的优势与挑战

在团队中工作更容易实现这种**个人谦逊**。团队协作有几个方面：独自一人很难跳出自己的思维定式，而与他人交流可以拓宽可能性。更困难但也更重要的是，与那些你持不同意见的人交流。科学界建立了一整套传统，将研究成果提交给那些会严苛审视并指出其中缺陷的人。这实际上是找出错误的最成功方法之一。然而，作为一个更大的社会，我们似乎已经失去了这种技能，或者说忘记了为什么需要与持不同意见的人交流以及其价值所在。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Now, that's easier if you work in a team, right? So, what's so special about teams?

>> There's a there's a couple aspects to this. One is that I think it's very easy, very hard to think outside of your own head when you're by yourself. And as soon as you start talking to other people, it opens up the range of possibilities. Even more difficult, but even more important is talking to people that you think that you disagree with. And so, science has built a whole tradition of taking your work and putting it in front of people who are going to give it a hard time and are going to show all the flaws in it. And that's actually one of the most successful ways to figure out where you may be going wrong. Our society as a larger society seems to have lost a lot of that skill um or or that memory of of why it is that you talk to people that you disagree with and where the usefulness of it comes in.
</details>

### 社会为何失去异议沟通能力？

**佩尔穆特**认为，社会之所以失去这种异议沟通能力，是因为我们在相互交流中经历了不同的浪潮，其中一些倾向于将人们限制在只与观点相同者交流的群体中。这导致他们觉得其他群体“可怕”，从外部看，很容易认为其他群体“不好”或“邪恶”，不值得信任。然而，当人们真正相互交流并共同思考问题时，几乎总是会发现，这些身处不同沟通“泡沫”中的人，实际上拥有几乎所有相同的宏大目标。他们之间的差异更多地在于对某些事实问题的看法，而非根本的优先事项完全不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Why has society lost this? I think we happen to go through different waves um in in our um in our communication with each other and some of them tend to be um oh they tend to corner people into um groups where they are only talking to people who already agree with them and then they find that the other groups sound scary and the other groups that from the outside it's very easy um for for a group that was that's talking among themselves and you're talking with a different for the other group to look like they're just bad in some way, evil or or out to do something that you that you don't trust. But when people actually communicate with each other and think through problems together, almost invariably they start discovering that the actual people themselves that may be in these separate bubbles of communication turn out to really share almost all of the same big goals. And the differences are much more just the question of what do they think the answer is to some factual question u rather than really their priorities being completely different.
</details>

### 科学中的抱负与现实：谦逊与傲慢的平衡

主持人提问，在科学领域，自我（ego）的空间是否比社会其他领域小？**佩尔穆特**回应说，他总是区分科学的**抱负层面**（Aspirational Aspects: 理想状态下科学应有的特质）和**日常实际情况**（What Actually Happens Day-to-Day: 现实中科学实践的状况）。在日常工作中，人们确实会犯错，不会总是遵循最佳科学理念的规范。然而，从整体来看，科学的抱负目标是乐于接受批评。这很难做到，并非每个科学家每次都能做到，但从大局来看，人们最终会听取论文审稿人的意见，听取会议报告中提出的异议。这最终会产生巨大影响，即使他们最初不愿听，但最终会意识到必须回答这些问题，从而磨砺他们的思维。

**佩尔穆特**认为，科学文化中有一种“傲慢”是很有趣的：它让你相信，甚至自欺欺人地认为，你可以解决难题，并坚持足够长的时间去解决它们。大多数人可能没有毅力坚持一个问题足够久。而科学文化则引导人们相信问题可以解决，即使一周内未能解决，也会继续努力，看到一些进展，然后尝试不同的方法，最终解决问题。这需要一种特殊的自信，一种可以称之为“傲慢”的特质，才能坚持足够长的时间去解决那些值得我们解决的问题。这是一种非常奇特的平衡：既要非常谦逊，愿意承认错误，又要非常自信，相信我们能够解决问题。这种“我们能做到”的信念，是科学成功的真正秘诀之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> But if you work with um somebody whose job is to shoot down your arguments um do do is there less room for ego in science than in other parts of society.

>> Well I always describe the the aspirational aspects of science as opposed to the what actually happens day-to-day.

>> Dayto day people do things wrong dayto-day. they they don't follow the prescriptions of of you know I think what this best idea of what science and this third millennium thinking that I'm describing has offered us um as a whole though um that's the aspirational goal to be open to being to listening when somebody gives you criticism and it's very difficult to do not every scientist does it every time but in the big picture eventually people listen to the the referee's comments on papers they they listen to the uh the objections raised in a conference when they're giving a talk um And it ends up actually making a big difference. It means that, you know, they they may not want to hear it the first three or four times, but eventually they think, you know, I've got to answer that question. And that sharpens up their thinking.

>> So, it's kind of tied into the whole confident humility.

>> Absolutely. Concept.

>> Absolutely. And, you know, I don't think of the the the typical image of a scientist as being a humble uh uh you person. But

>> are you humble?

>> In this particular respect, I think um I aspire to being as humble as I can, right? I know that I've done things wrong and I've figured things I've I've missed made mistakes and I've caught them sometimes myself but other times I've only caught them because somebody else was there. Um and which parts of you are less humble?

>> So so I think the part that that's less humble is is actually sort of an interesting one. Um I there's another side of the culture of science which I think has to be um arrogant in a very interesting way which is that you I think science has benefited by having a culture that allows you to believe or maybe even fool yourself into thinking that you can solve difficult problems

>> long enough to solve them. And and the problem is that most of us I don't think are built to stick to a problem as long as it really takes. And so I think we tend to um think well I tried very hard on that problem. I spent at least a day on it. Maybe I spent a week on it. Um and then you give up. Um whereas the culture of science has I think led people to think we can solve that problem and if we didn't figure it out that week we'll keep working on it and we see some progress maybe by you know a month or so from now we'll try something different and then another month and eventually people figure out these these problems. And it takes a certain kind of um confidence, a certain kind of of and I you can you can call it arrogance. I think I think to to manage to stay with a problem long enough to to do these problems that are worth that are worth our solving.

>> Well, you have to kind of you have to be a bit of a diehard believer in your own brilliance, right?

>> Exactly. And and it's a very strange thing because you want what you really want is this funny balance between being very humble and very willing to be wrong

>> and yet very can do that we're going to be able to figure this thing out so that you if it doesn't work you think there's got to be a different way we can do this and that is I think one of the real secrets of this of how science has worked this this in some sense it's the the breaks um of the of of making mistakes that so many of the things that science involves is the skepticisms and the doubts that keep you from falling into certain kinds of mental traps. But you can't drive a car with just brakes. You you need, you know, you need an accelerator pedal. And I think that accelerator pedal is this can do sense that we can figure this out. You know, it's a pro. It's a hard problem, but once you identify the problem, we have a reasonable chance of of figuring out how to solve it.
</details>

### 优秀团队的特质与科学协作的演变

**佩尔穆特**认为，一个优秀的团队需要具备多种技能的人员组合，但他们不能过于以自我为中心，而应乐于共同集思广益、相互倾听。这种能力强但又享受团队合作和共同思考的人，正是他在团队中寻找的特质。此外，团队成员还需要具备“我能做到”的精神，愿意与团队一起为问题投入额外的时间。

**诺贝尔奖**（Nobel Prize）越来越多地由团队获得。科学活动已不再是“孤独科学家”的个人行为。即使是相对较小的项目，也通常由团队完成。许多科学研究需要不同的专业知识和组成部分，而且规模已变得足够大，往往需要相当大的团队。例如，**佩尔穆特**自己参与的项目最初约有30人，而近年来，这些项目的下一阶段已发展到数百人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> What makes a good team? What I've seen that for me at least that that's been uh the thing that's made a huge difference is that combination of people who come in with a wide variety of skills um but who aren't so ego-driven that they can't uh just join a group together and bounce ideas with each other and listen to each other. And that combination of people who are very capable but are also able to to enjoy the the team nature and and and thinking together. That's the thing that I usually am looking for in a in in in a group along a little bit with that you know you always want the person to be very skilled and capable and but you also want them have a little that can do spirit that they think that it's worth staying in the room with the group of people and and worrying the problem for that extra time that you know most people wouldn't. Increasingly um Nobel prizes are worn by teams.

>> So the in general science has become less and less of a you know single person activity you know with the image of the lone scientist putting on their lab coat and going down to the lab and disappearing. Um that's never that's not been my experience at all. And uh and even rather small groups are still often groups um of of people doing projects. And a lot of science just requires enough different expertise and different parts and the scales have gotten big enough that they often are fairly big teams. They're you know the uh the projects I was doing were smallish in the sense of maybe 30 you know 30 people uh you know all working together on something. Um but the very next stage of those same projects in in more recent years are now hundreds of of people on those projects.
</details>

### 大型团队的协作平衡

管理大型团队的工作分配和整个过程非常棘手，需要各种平衡。一方面，我们希望团队成员能够共享许多方法和资源，例如共享软件进行协作。但另一方面，如果共享过多，就可能无法进行独立的比较，从而难以发现错误。因此，在某种意义上，我们需要鼓励“**分裂小组**”（Splinter Groups: 在大团队内部形成的小型独立工作组）在某些方面独立工作，同时整个团队又在达成共识。这种平衡贯穿于《**第三千年思维**》一书的整个故事中，即在大多数事情上，你都必须在同时追求的几个不同目标之间找到正确的平衡点，而这些目标并非总是显而易见的可以同时实现。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

What are the challenges in terms of splitting the work and managing that whole process?

>> It's very tricky because you you um have all sorts of balancing acts to do. So there's the the fact that you want groups of people to share a lot of of their approaches and other resources. They might share their software uh with each other to work on it. But there's a danger um then that if they've shared too much, then you don't get the um the independent comparisons that that you can often find the errors with. So you you in some sense need to encourage um sort of splinter groups to be working on things while the whole group is is coming to a consensus at the same time. And that these balancing acts actually go throughout the whole third millennium thinking story that in that book uh is that most things you're doing you're having to get that right ch balance between several different things you're trying to achieve that aren't necessarily obvious that you would do them at the same time.
</details>

### 室内乐与团队科学项目

**佩尔穆特**提到，他曾思考过生命中一些有影响力的老师。除了研究导师和某些课程的老师，那些教授乐器演奏的老师也对他影响深远。例如，他的小提琴老师**弗朗西斯·斯塔菲**（Francis Stuffy）教会了他极致的细致和精确，同时又充满精神和制作音乐的目标，而非仅仅是“做对”某事。他至今仍在演奏。

**佩尔穆特**一直对演奏弦乐四重奏和其他**室内乐**（Chamber Music: 一种由少数演奏者在小型空间中演奏的古典音乐形式）感兴趣，而非独奏。他认为，室内乐的乐趣与团队科学项目解决科学问题时的乐趣非常相似：一群人各司其职，但必须相互倾听，这种来回的专注使得整个过程充满活力，这也是团队科学项目充满乐趣的原因之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> How does chamber music come into this? Because that's one of your teams. So I was I was thinking about uh this from the point of view of um you know who have been some of my more influential teachers in in my life and uh and you know some of them you know it's obvious uh a my research adviser was you know very influential as when I was going my PhD in physics and and others you know are in that category of you know teachers that in certain courses that you've taken that that I I still remember but perhaps one of the more uh um interesting ones is for those people who've taken studied a an instrument um in their lives um your your teacher of that instrument has stayed with you for usually had stayed with you for many many years um while you were growing up. And so in my case my violin teacher was a was a very influential person. Her name her her name was Francis Stuffy and she um was able to teach a certain degree of this this mix of extreme care and and and precision but with a spirit and a and a and a goal of making music not of uh of of just doing something right, you know. And

>> do you still play?

>> And I do still play. And the and the thing that I was always interested in when I was playing was not solo music. I was interested in playing string quartets and other kinds of chamber music. And I think the pleasures in that are are very much some of the same pleasures as in group uh efforts for like science solving a scientific problem that you have a group of people who are all contributing something but they have to listen to each other and and the then the degree of of paying attention back and forth I think is what makes that so enlivening and it's also I think one of the things that makes a group science project fun.
</details>

### 盲法分析：对抗确认偏见的利器

**佩尔穆特**解释了**盲法分析**（Blind Analysis: 一种实验数据分析技术，分析人员在分析过程中不了解关键参数或结果，以减少偏见）的概念。他指出，我们都面临着**确认偏见**（Confirmation Bias: 人们倾向于寻找、解释和记忆支持自己已有信念的信息，而忽略或贬低与自己信念相悖的信息）这个经典问题。在日常生活中，我们很容易只阅读那些符合我们已有信念的新闻报道，而忽略那些提出不同观点的信息。即使偶然读到一篇与我们观点相悖的文章，我们也会倾向于寻找其中的错误，而对于支持我们观点的文章，则不会以同样的方式寻找其缺陷。

这种偏见不仅存在于政治和新闻阅读中，也存在于科学项目中。当科学家测量数据并绘制图表时，如果结果符合或不符合他们预期中的理论，他们会非常兴奋。然而，这里存在一个真正的危险：人们可能会接受那些符合他们预期的图表，而对那些不符合预期的图表则更倾向于寻找错误。这意味着，发表在论文中的图表往往带有偏见，因为它们更符合科学家的预期，而科学家们不会去寻找这些图表中的错误。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> What is blind analysis? One of the classic problems that uh that we that we've become aware of um actually in in the larger world, we see it in this thing called confirmation bias. Um where you it's very easy when you're let's say trying to see what uh what some news story is telling you. Um to fall into the danger of only reading the news stories that already tell you something that you believe and not reading the ones that are giving you um information that would disagree with something you believe. And when you do happen to read an article that says something that's disagrees with something that you that you think is right, um you would you look for all the things all the mistakes it's making. Whereas when you see an article that's saying, "Oh, somebody did a study and it and it agrees with something you that you like." You don't look for its flaws in the same way.

>> And this happens actually not only in like politics and and and when you're reading the newspaper, but in a science project. Um so when you're measuring some you know some uh you know graph the points for a graph and it's going to agree with a theory or disagree with a theory and you're very excited to see what the results are. Um there's a real danger that and you and you see it has happened now in in history. You can go back and look through the the uh graphs of of the past and you see that there's a danger that people accept the graph when it's when they think it's showing you what they were sort of expecting to see either because it confirmed a theory or it disagreed with theory whichever it was that they were kind of expecting it to show and they're more likely to look for the errors in that in that graph um if it's showing something that they don't expect. So that means that there's a real bias towards having graphs come out in papers that are just what the scientist was expecting to to get because those are the ones that they don't go hunting for the errors in
</details>

### 盲法分析的实践与挑战

近年来，物理学家们开始意识到这是一个陷阱，并将其视为科学的核心理念之一——识别陷阱并找出解决方案。物理学界开始采用**盲法分析**来解决这个特定陷阱。在这种技术中，研究人员在所有人都同意已经检查了测量中的所有错误之前，不会看到最终的图表结果。只有在所有错误都检查完毕后，才会“打开信封”，查看数字对应的真实值，从而判断结果是否符合预期或希望。这是一个颇具戏剧性的时刻。

**佩尔穆特**回忆起一次小组会议，当时一位学生即将“揭盲”他们一年半以来的数据。如果结果符合预期，她将获得一份出色的博士论文；如果不符合，结果将令人失望。一切都取决于揭盲的那一刻。他记得有一次，会议开到深夜，过了晚餐时间，大家还在争论是现在揭盲，还是等到第二天精神饱满时再揭盲，因为如果结果不理想，在一天结束时会非常令人沮丧。但最终，大家相互对视，决定“现在就看吧”，并准备接受任何结果。那次的结果是好的，虽然并非每次都如此。

>> the and in recent years that was that's become something where the physicists started to become aware that this was a trap that people were falling into and one of the whole ideas of science is to recognize these traps and then to figure out how to solve them. So the way the physics the physics community has started to solve this particular trap is they've started using this technique called blind analysis where you don't let your see let yourself see the results the the final graphs with the real uh you know the real uh values on the graph um until everybody has agreed that you've looked for all the errors in the measurement. And then when you've checked for all the errors, then you open the envelope and you see what the numbers correspond to and and you see whether the the answer is what you were expecting or what you wanted or if it goes against what you wanted or were expecting. And it's a it's a kind of dramatic moment. Um so uh you I've been in we've been in the group meetings where we were sitting there was the end of the day and one of our students had was about to unblind their data that they've been working over the last year and a half and if they came out a certain way they would have a wonderful PhD thesis. If it didn't, it would be a disappointing uh result. And uh and it was all going to depend on what happened when they opened this uh they opened this blind blinded result. And uh I remember one time particularly was like late at night. We had gone for a long long meeting and it was past dinner time and we were trying to decide okay are we going to open it now or should we wait in the morning and do it when we're fresh, you know, because if it comes out wrong it's going to be really devastating at the end of the day. Um uh maybe we should wait until we're you know sort of you know well rested etc. And we all looked at each and said each other and said, "Nah, let's look at it." And so we decided that was the time that we're going to unblind and we were going to have to accept whatever we got.

>> And was it good?

>> That time it was good.

>> Not every time, but that time it was it was

### 确认偏见在社会和投资中的危害

**确认偏见**的概念非常有趣。例如，如果你持有一种政治观点，就只看**福克斯新闻**（Fox News: 美国一家保守派新闻频道）；如果你持另一种观点，就只看其他媒体。这正是导致社会两极分化的原因。这是一个真正的问题。我们倾向于，如果你是**福克斯新闻**的观众，当你看到《**纽约时报**》（New York Times: 美国一份著名报纸）的文章时，你会非常怀疑；如果你是《**纽约时报**》的读者，当你看到**福克斯新闻**的报道时，你会认为其中有错误。我们倾向于在对方的报道中寻找错误，而不是在自己的报道中。

**确认偏见**对投资者来说也极具危害，因为当你进行一项投资后，你可能只会阅读那些证实你已有观点的消息。这显然是一个深层次的问题，我们所有人，在做几乎任何事情时，都可能陷入这个陷阱。**佩尔穆特**还以医疗为例：当你决定某种医疗方案是好是坏时，你很容易在网站上搜索，直到找到一个符合你期望的说法。他认为，真正需要做的是，首先不看网站对你具体情况的说法，而是先判断哪些网站在其他所有方面更值得信任。这样，你可以在“盲选”网站，不知道它会给出何种具体建议的情况下，做出选择，然后再阅读其推荐。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> the whole concept of confirmation bias is interesting, right? I mean, you got one political view and then you only watch Fox News, you got another point of view, you only watch something else.

>> Exactly.

>> You know, this is I guess what creates more of the polarization in society.

>> No, it's it's a a real problem. And and also we tend to, you know, if you are a Fox News watcher watcher, when you see a New York Times article, you assume that it was you're very skeptical about it. And if you're a New York Times reader and you watch a Fox News story, you assume that there's something something got something wrong in it. And you tend to look for all the errors um in the other but not in your own uh your own reporters. M and confirmation bias is very very problematic also for investors because you made an investment and the only piece of news you you you read is the stuff that's confirming your already existing you know view.

>> I mean I think it's you know clearly it's one of these deep problems that for all of us for almost anything we're doing we can fall into that trap. I I been describing it also, you know, like when you're trying to decide, let me use the medical example again. Um, you're trying to decide, you know, whether or not you something is a good idea, bad idea for medical treatment. And there's a real temptation to um hunt on the websites until you find uh one that that um says what you want to hear.

>> And I think that, you know, the really what you need to do is you need to first uh without looking at what it says about your particular case, look for which websites do you trust more about everything else besides that one. So that you choose your website blinded without knowing what it would say for your particular case and then you read what it recommends.

### 投资决策中的群体智慧与偏见规避

假设我们投资了100万美元的**苹果股票**（Apple stock），房间里有四个人，我们如何最好地分析、质疑和研究是否应该持有**苹果**股票？首先，房间里有四个人本身就是一种优势，因为他们可以带来不同的信息来源。但更重要的是，不能让他们都聚在一起，然后第一个人就开始说出所有推荐或不推荐投资的理由，接着第二个人、第三个人再发言。因为他们会受到前一个人发言的强烈影响，这存在“**群体思维**”（Herd Thinking: 群体中个体倾向于跟随多数人的意见，而非独立思考）的真正危险。人们可能会锁定一个听起来很好的论点，而不愿提出他们从其他来源获得的信息，也不想显得自己在争论或与他人冲突。

因此，更好的做法是让每个人独立地写下所有信息，然后汇总。之后，大家再一起审视这些信息，并思考如何同时处理所有这些信息。人们已经使用了一些工具来在不同类型的组织活动中进行这类“游戏”，以充分利用群体智慧。

>> So listen now I have bought a million dollars worth of Apple stock.

>> Yes.

>> Okay. And we have four people around in the room here. Uh what's the best way to analyze and question uh and research whether we should own Apple or not. So to begin with um the fact that you have four people in the room um could be a real asset, right? Because they they could um have different sources of information and be able to bring different

>> Well, I'm sorry. Should we have four people in the room? First of all, let's start from to let's start from total scratch.

>> Okay, so I I got a million million dollars of Apple stock. How should we decide whether that's a good investment? All right. So obviously um part of the story is what where is the information in in out in the world that would give you the most uh uh chance at doing good predictions in in this case and you know in this in this story of course you have to decide you know where do you expect the most information to lie. Is it going to be with the people who are doing the technology development? Is it going to be with the people who are doing the consumer uh research? Um will it be actual consumers themselves that are missed by the consumer research? And depending on what where you think the the you know the most information sits um you might want to bring different uh people to the table. Um my guess would be um that in many of these of these topics you you want a fairly broad range of sources of information some that you would not have even thought of and that actually you know requires reaching more people than you might typically uh do if you're trying to bring information in. You cannot have them all um get together and start uh walking around the room with the first person um saying uh all the best reasons for why it is that they would recommend the investment or not um or what form to do it in. Um and then have the next person talk and the next person talk because they will be so influenced by what the previous person says that there's a real danger that you just get heard thinking that people lock in on what sounded like a very good argument and they don't want to embarrass themselves by bringing in some other information that they have from a different source. nor do they want to sound like they're they're arguing. They don't want to sound like they're conflicting necessarily with the other uh people or the previous person, you know, in the room. So, it's much better to get all the information written down independently so people provide it separately and then aggregate it. Then people look at it together and try to figure out okay now how do we work with this all this information at the same time. Um so there are a number of tools that people have used for playing these games in different uh different kinds of organizational um activities that that get the best of that when they when when you can. Um I I particularly like um some decisions that need both some values in play as well as the factual issues. Um some of those um seem to be done very well with using random samples of the population which of course is a little bit different from uh from probably what you'll be doing in an investment case. Um but even there you never know. It could be that having a broader um random reach would reach the source of information that it never would have occurred to uh you know if you were just stepping back and and trying to choose your 10 people.

### 偏见的负面案例与情景规划

**佩尔穆特**举了一个偏见的糟糕例子：在**挪威最高法院**（Norwegian Supreme Court），最年长、经验最丰富的法官首先发言。结果，该法院的异议率据称是所有法院中最低的。这与我们讨论的理念完全相反。而在瑞典，最年轻的法官首先发言，结果异议率要高得多。这令人难以置信，但这种现象却能持续多年。我们经常听到这类故事，意识到这些偏见的存在，人们应该积极思考如何纠正它们。另一个例子是，有人比较了午餐前和午餐后的判刑情况：如果你饿了，你被判有罪入狱的可能性就会大大增加。这同样是荒谬的，却被允许长期存在。

针对投资案例，当收集到所有人的独立意见后，下一步就是如何有效地达成富有成效的共识。**佩尔穆特**推荐一种名为**情景规划**（Scenario Planning: 一种战略规划方法，通过构建多个未来可能的情景来帮助组织应对不确定性）的技术，这最初可能是为商业目的开发的。其目标是识别可能改变未来某个领域（例如消费计算领域）的**驱动力**（Driving Forces: 影响未来发展方向的关键因素）。例如，资源可用性、经济增长、收入差距、气候变化，甚至是**人工智能**（AI: Artificial Intelligence: 模拟人类智能的机器系统）以新方式的实现。团队成员会写下所有可能的驱动力，然后选择其中几个（有时甚至只有两个）看似完全不相关的驱动力，并考虑它们在所有四种极端情况下的组合。例如，停滞不前的经济与快速增长的经济，以及剧烈的气候变化与气候稳定。然后，针对每种组合，思考在这种情况下最佳的投资策略是什么。这迫使我们深入思考哪些因素是稳健的，哪些不是，无论这些特定的未来情景是否会成为现实。这是一种非常有用的方式，可以帮助我们考虑比通常情况下更广泛的可能性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

I think one of the one of the really uh bad examples of this bias is you know in the Norwegian Supreme Court uh the oldest and most experienced uh member of the court speaks first.

>> Ah yes

>> and you have the lowest supposedly disagreement of any court because of that.

>> Now it sounds like the exact uh opposite of this concept. Yeah. Because now you're

>> in Sweden just around the corner. Y

>> uh is the youngest person who speaks first. Is that right? Yeah. And you have much more disagreement.

>> That's fascinating.

>> Is that unbelievable? No.

>> That's really interesting. That's really very interesting.

>> But how can this last for years and years and years?

>> I mean you you you hear about all of these kinds of stories where you where you realize those biases people should be jumping on and asking how do how do we fix that? I mean the other one I was I remember reading about was I for where it was where you they compared the um I think the sentencing um after lunch and before lunch.

>> Yeah. Absolutely. Right. And it was

>> totally if you if you're hungry bang you are guilty in prison you go.

>> Yeah. Which is you know which is also crazy you know that that that would be allowed to go on for a long time. Yeah.

>> Incredible. Okay. So now we have we have this uh investment case potential. Uh we have people from all kind all over the place. They written down what they think. Okay. So nobody's biased by anybody. So what do you do then? How do you get some productivities agreement going here?

>> So I do think that um now this is the time where I think bringing people into a room and encouraging them to actually bounce ideas off each other and to be thinking very hard about um the possible ways in which the world could be different than they think. So here is a technique uh that we're was actually I think might have been developed actually originally for business purposes was this technique called scenario planning. Um this is something that uh uh that I've um been Peter Schwarz was somebody who I I came across who was teaching this uh and uh he's has has a book on this actually um but the their the goal was to try and identify driving forces that could change the future in in some topic area. Um I mean in this case you know I guess if we're talking about Apple stock right it's it's a presumably consumer uh computing you know um and then trying to uh just have a group of people that come from a wide a wide set of backgrounds just begin by just writing down all of the things that could drive the future um with respect to it. Is it you know going to be resource uh availability? Is it um is it going to be um economic uh growth? Um is it going to be economic disparity of you know different levels of income? Um will it be uh you know odd things like climate uh change? You know how could that possibly affect uh you know the consumer computing? Um will it be AI uh you know coming to fruition in some new way? Um and so they you write down a whole group of these and you choose a few of them even sometimes just two that look like they'd be um completely unrelated to each other. and and then consider the extremes of those two um in all four possibilities. So you know let's say um a stagnant uh economy where there is not much growth versus a very rapidly growing economy and then in the other direction maybe um you know you might have chosen you know climate uh uh strong you know large climate change and you know and and climate stasis you know where things stay roughly the same and use look at all four of those combinations and ask what would be our best in this case investment in each of those situations because it forces you to think through um the the logic of um of where where what things are robust and what things aren't robust, whether or not those particular futures are the right answer. It's it's a it's a very useful way of being able to consider a wider variety than you typically will do. I mean, if you're just stuck thinking about the future that everybody else is talking about that you all reading in the in the same newspapers,

### 鼓励异议与反直觉发现

如何激励人们提出异议、发现错误和缺陷？**佩尔穆特**认为，有意地允许不同群体竞争，而不是试图让所有人都处于一个协作群体中，会产生积极影响。因为这样自然会形成团队，而团队自然有动力去寻找其他团队可能犯的错误。这正是科学进步中一个非常有趣的方式：人们在能够发现别人没有发现的东西时，会感到真正的乐趣，其中一种表现就是他们会找出早期思维中的缺陷。如果在任何组织中，你都能鼓励这种友好的竞争，鼓励人们尝试新想法并相互提出异议，而不是将其视为不友好的行为，而是视为过程的一部分，那么这种文化将非常有帮助。

在投资领域，最好的投资通常是当你判断正确而没有人同意你的时候，这往往是反直觉的发现。在科学领域也是如此。**佩尔穆特**指出，他之所以获得**诺贝尔奖**，并不是因为他们做了一个非常棒的实验，而是因为实验结果出人意料。通常，在科学领域表现出色的人，是因为他们发现了别人没有看到的东西，这让所有人感到兴奋，因为他们意识到世界原来以这种特殊的方式运作，这非常重要。

>> how do you incentivize people to to disagree and to find mistakes and and flaws? Well, there's one of the reasons why I think um intentionally um allowing for different groups competing as opposed to trying to get everybody to be in one collaborative group um does make a difference because then you naturally get teams, you know, and the teams are naturally um they naturally have the incentive to look for the things that the others may have gotten wrong. And I think that's actually been one of the very interesting ways in which science has progressed that I think you've seen that people have some uh real pleasure in being able to find something that nobody else found and one of the way one ways that shows up is they they find the flaws in the earlier thinking. Um, and I think that if you can manage to do that in any organization where you you encourage there to be a bit of friendly competition going on, uh, where people are trying out ideas and that they're encouraged to be disagreeing with each other, that that's not seen as a as unfriendly thing to do, but it's just that's part of the the process. Um, I think it's a culture that really helps

>> Absolutely.

>> So what are some of the most counterintuitive

>> Well, I mean the uh well the only reason

>> right the only reason I won a Nobel Prize was not because we had done what was really fun great experiment. It was because it came up with a real surprising result.

>> Yeah. And it is very surprising and you know that's that's like a cliffhanger because you have to you have to continue to listen to get to that one.

>> Yes. Yes.

>> Okay. We'll leave that. We'll leave that. uh in the meantime

>> but but I will say that you know in general um the you know the people who do well in the sciences um usually are doing well because they come up with something that nobody else has seen um and that that excites everybody that that you know they all say wow you know we didn't realize that the world was working that particular way um and that's really important to know and that's where the excitement is not somebody usually um it's not somebody who was just showing more of the same of what people already thought

### 不确定性：爱恨交织的超能力

我们对**不确定性**（Uncertainty: 缺乏确定性或可预测性的状态）有着一种爱恨交织的关系。从某种意义上说，它正是人们热爱许多游戏和娱乐活动的原因。人们喜欢那种“可能这样，也可能那样”的感觉。没有人会想玩一场每次都知道结果的体育比赛。每个人都喜欢那种可能发生一些令人惊讶的事情的感觉，并期待这种惊喜的发生。

然而，我们也容易感到恐惧。我们很容易觉得，如果我们不知道下一步会发生什么，一切都可能变得糟糕：可能没有足够的食物，可能没有地方睡觉。**佩尔穆特**认为这可能是一种**进化优势**（Evolutionary Advantage: 某种特征或行为有助于生物体在环境中生存和繁殖）。如果你总是小心翼翼，确保不会失去生存所需的基本条件，那么你可能会足够早地进行狩猎和耕作，为下一个季节储备食物。所以，他可以想象这可能是一种非常有用的文化和心理进化。

但这种心态必须平衡。我们不能被恐惧驱使到不敢走出洞穴、不敢尝试新想法的地步。因为如果我们只使用旧想法，世界会发生变化，而旧想法不一定能跟上世界的步伐，它们甚至可能不是最好的想法。通常，它们只是在某个时刻，当有人提出它们时，对当时情况的足够好的模型。但可能存在更好的理解世界的方式，而我们不希望错过这些。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> why do we find uncertainty so hard.

>> I think that we have a a very lovehate relationship with uncertainty, right? Because uh in some sense it's what people love about so much so many games and so many uh things that they that they're going to do for fun. They they love that sense that it could go this way, it could go that way. Um nobody would would really want to, you know, play a sports where every single time you knew exactly how it was all going to come out. um that you en everybody enjoys that sense that something a little bit surprising could happen here and they look for that surprising thing to to occur. But we also are very easily scared. I mean it's very easy I think for us to feel like if we don't know that we're going to, you know, get to the next stage exactly the way everything is. Who knows? It could be bad. It could be that we wouldn't have enough to eat. Could be that we don't, you know, have a place to sleep. And and I think that that is probably an evolutionary uh you know deep down uh you know advantage um that if you if you are always being careful that you're not going to lose the fundamentals that that you need to live then probably you'll look out to you know what do your hunting and your farming early enough so you'll have food for the uh for the next season. Um, so I can imagine that that could have been a very useful cultural and and maybe even psychological thing to evolve,

>> but it's it's has to be balanced. You know, you you need uh to be u not driven by fear to the point that you don't step out of your cave and and out of your house and you don't try out ideas. Um because if you just just use the old ideas, the world changes. And the old ideas don't necessarily track um what we what what the world's doing. And they and they're not even the best ideas. Often they're they were good enough models of what was going on at the moment when somebody came up with them. But

>> there could be much better ways of understanding the world. And that is really what you want. You don't you don't want to miss those. And sometimes you need them

### 科学中的模式识别与直觉

主持人提到他在社会心理学领域的研究，特别是关于投资中的**直觉**（Gut Feel: 基于经验和直觉而非逻辑分析的判断）或**模式识别**（Pattern Recognition: 识别数据、事件或现象中重复出现或有意义的规律的能力）。**佩尔穆特**认为，科学中绝对有**模式识别**和**直觉**的空间。我们的大脑在理解世界时，会进行一种有趣的组合工作。一部分是逻辑性的、我们有意识地进行的思考，例如“我看到了这个和那个，所以我认为世界可能是这样的”。但另一部分则令人困惑，我们不明白事物是如何联系起来的。人们会不断思考，然后有一天睡醒后突然想到“嘿，我想我知道它是怎么运作的！”这表明**无意识思维**（Unconscious Mind: 不受意识控制的心理活动）也在解决问题中发挥作用，它可能更像**神经网络**（Neural Networks: 模拟大脑神经元连接方式的计算模型）那样，无法精确追溯模式识别的来源，但却能很好地识别我们平时无法察觉的模式。

**佩尔穆特**认为，将这两种思维方式结合起来非常重要。因为有些**模式识别**是错误的，我们可能会识别出我们认为存在的模式，但它并非真实。所以，我们需要用我们深思熟虑的理性思维去回顾和分析，并使用统计学等工具来判断这种模式是否仅仅是随机噪声。同时，有时也需要通过长时间专注于一个问题来“喂养”**模式识别**思维，最终似乎能迫使它在你睡觉时继续工作。他提到与国际象棋大师**马格努斯·卡尔森**（Magnus Carlsen）的播客，**卡尔森**就是用直觉选择三步潜在的走法，然后再进行严谨分析。这与**佩尔穆特**的观点非常相似。

<summary>Original English</summary>

>> in in um I did a a degree in social psychology and I did my dissertation on on gut feel in investing. Well, I mean gut feel, nobody believes in gut field, but we call it pattern recognition. They always say they believe in it. Is there a room for pattern recognition in science?

>> Oh, or gut feel.

>> Oh, absolutely. Right. Because we we know that that our brains are doing a a very interesting combination of work when they're trying to understand what's going on out in the world. Um, some of it is the logical stuff that we're very conscious of that we're very aware that, you know, okay, I've just seen this and I've seen that. So I'm putting them together and I'm betting that probably that means that uh you know this aspect of of the world must be the case. But some of it you you're really puzzled. You don't see how is it possible that this thing and this thing turned into this thing and people work on it and work on it work on it and then some days they go to sleep and they wake up in the morning they think hey I think I know how that works. And we we think and this is some evidence that uh that the unconscious mind also has part the it gives us other ways of solving problems maybe a little bit more like the way uh these neural networks do in you where you don't you can't really track down exactly which thing was the source of the pattern recognition but in fact it does a very good job of figuring out patterns that we otherwise wouldn't catch. I I I often think that it's it's really good to try to play these two against each other. So um you you because some of the pattern recognition is wrong that we just we recognize things that we think we see a pattern and it's not really true. So we use our very thoughtful rational mind to go back and analyze and and use things like statistics to tell whether that pattern could have come appeared just from random noise um and that the the randomness looked to us like a pattern. Um so that's very um useful to apply your rational mind to your you know your logical rational mind to the pattern recognition side of the mind to to weed out the good from the bad parts of what you've come up with. But also the other way around, sometimes you need to feed the um the uh the pattern recognition mind by focusing uh the the rational mind for a long time on a problem and eventually that it seems to force the uh the pattern finder to go working while you're sleeping.

>> Yeah. Interesting. Uh we uh did a podcast with Magnus Carson, the chess player.

>> Yes. And so he uses his um kind of gut feel to choose for instance three different potential moves and then he then analyze them properly.

>> Ah that's that's very similar in that

>> absolutely absolutely

>> now he thinks that uh you know spending more than 10 minutes on analyzing is more than that doesn't really add a lot uh which is interesting. Now that's then that's probably

>> but then he's very quick,

>> right? I was gonna say it probably gives you a sense of exactly where his where his depth level is for his analysis that you know at that point he realizes he's no longer adding uh adding enough information. Yeah.

### 批判性思维的教学与推广

**佩尔穆特**谈到如何教授**批判性思维**（Critical Thinking: 对信息进行客观分析和评估，以形成合理判断的能力）。最初他们并不确定这种能力的可教性。他与**公共政策学院**的社会心理学家**罗布·麦卡恩**（Rob McCun）和哲学家**约翰·坎贝尔**（John Campbell）三位教授，在**加州大学伯克利分校**（University of California, Berkeley）共同开设了一门课程。他们贴出告示：“你是否对社会做决策的方式感到尴尬？来帮助我们设计一门课程，来帮助拯救世界吧！”大约30名研究生和博士后每周五下午都会来参加会议，常常持续到晚餐之后，长达九个月。他们梳理了一系列思想，认为如果能清晰地掌握这些思想，将有助于思考世界上的问题。然后，他们开始思考如何教授每个思想，使其不仅适用于某个特定主题，而是在阅读报纸文章或日常生活中做选择时，都能自然地运用这些思想。这通常意味着他们会设计活动、游戏，有时只是好的讨论问题。这种混合教学方式最终被用于这门课程，事实证明既有趣又有效。这门课程随后被其他大学（如**哈佛大学**、**芝加哥大学**大学、**加州大学欧文分校**，现在**哥伦比亚大学**也在引入）复制推广。

**佩尔穆特**认为，这是科学真正包含的“秘密配方”之一，可以帮助所有人。世界比以往任何时候都更加不确定，因此我们需要更多的结构和严谨性。思考工具非常重要，就像我们教授说明文写作一样，虽然并非所有学生都将成为作家，但写作时如何思考问题是一种非常重要的思维工具。而这些批判性思维工具在当今这个技术化、科学化的世界中，甚至在需要与他人共同做出概率决策的世界中，都显得尤为重要。他希望这些思想词汇能被所有人共享，成为每所大学的标准基础课程。

>> How do you teach this? How do you teach critical thinking?

>> We were not really sure how teachable it was when we began all this. So um there was a group of u well three faculty. I had a there was a social psychologist in the public policy school. That was Rob McCun and then there was a philosopher John Campbell and the three of us um started meeting um we we put a sign up saying uh are you uh are you embarrassed watching our society make decisions? Come help invent a course, come help save the world and about 30 students, graduate students, posttos started showing up um every week at the end of a Friday and we

>> So this was how you spent Friday nights?

>> It practically was it was for how long? It was Friday afternoons uh and and often went past dinner. Um and and this went on for like like nine months uh that we were meeting and what we were doing is we we were walking through what would be like a whole collection of ideas where if you had all those ideas clearly enough um it would help you think about problems in the world and then for each of them we started asking how could you teach that idea? Is there a way that you could get it across so that it wasn't just for one topic that you taught it, but anytime you read a newspaper article or anytime you walked down the street and you had to make a choice, um you would find yourself using the ideas and often that meant that we came up with like activities and games and and uh sometimes just good discussion questions and that mixture um is actually the way we end up teaching the course and I and I think it ended up uh it ended up being both fun but I think also a little bit effective. They copied that course in other universities as well. Right.

>> Exactly. So now it's starting to spread to other universities. We began it at Berkeley. It's now been taught uh at Harvard and University of Chicago and Irvine. I think now Colombia is picking it up.

>> True to be mandatory across the world.

>> I think that it's one of the things that people have it's one of the secret ingredients of what science really consists of that I think could help everybody. And so I

>> because because the world is more uncertain than it's ever been. Right. So you need more structure and vigor.

>> Exactly. And and I think that you know we've known for a long time that thinking tools are really important. That's I think one of the reasons we teach expository writing to students everywhere. Um they're not all planned to be writers, but I think the focus of how you think about a problem when you write is a very important thinking tool. But these are a whole set of other thinking tools that I that feel like they're very important in this technological scientific world. um and even a world where you just have to make probabilistic decisions with uh with other people and that so much of this has to do with how you can think together with people um in a productive way that you want that vocabulary of ideas to be shared by everybody. So I would love it to be as a standard basic course in every university.

**佩尔穆特**的母亲是社会工作教授，父亲是工程学教授，而他本人则与一位人类学家结婚，这使得他的家庭背景极具跨领域特色。他回忆说，父亲作为科学家，其精确、有条理的思维方式对他影响很大。他喜欢观察父亲进行计算、绘制图表，并被那种能够精确、有条理地了解世界的感觉所吸引。同时，母亲作为研究公共政策和公共管理的社会学教授，她的工作常常涉及大型协作项目。观察母亲如何与合作者一起工作，对他来说是完全不同的教育，让他很高兴看到一群人享受共同解决问题和思考的过程。他认为，这与观察父亲作为科学家一样，对他成长同样重要。

关于**人工智能**（AI）是否会抑制批判性思维，**佩尔穆特**认为它是一把双刃剑。就像我们最初对计算器感到不确定一样，**AI**可能给人一种已经掌握了基础知识的错觉，而实际上并非如此。学生可能会过早地依赖**AI**，而没有自己进行智力工作，这是潜在的危险。然而，积极的一面是，当你掌握了各种思考问题的工具和方法时，**AI**可以帮助你找到所需的信息，从而更好地运用这些技术。理想情况下，他会要求学生们认真思考如何利用**AI**来更轻松地将批判性思维概念付诸实践，同时也要思考如何运用这些概念来判断**AI**是否在误导你，是否在给出正确的方向。因为许多批判性思维工具正是为了帮助我们识别何时被愚弄。当前的**AI**一代非常善于表现出过度自信，但我们需要像评估自己或他人言论一样，判断**AI**结果的信任度。

>> Now um your mother was a professor in social work, your father was a professor in engineering and you are married to an anthropologist. So it doesn't get more cross domainish than that. Hey, what what did disc I mean what do discussions look like at your you know uh family dinners? Well, well, I remember uh at one point somebody was asking me, you know, how much influence was there of of having parents in these in these areas and I was thinking, well, my father was obviously a very big influence just because as a a scientist, uh, and you know, he would be doing calculations and I'd, you know, be seen the graphs and the and the calculator and I and just and slide rules back in those days. Um and and I think I was attracted to the fact that you can learn things about the world um that are very precise and and and organized and uh and I think I was enjoyed watching and and I was attracted to that. But at the same time I realized that I think probably just as influential uh was watching my mother who was a social professor. She studied public policy and public administration. Um and and then in her case, the work was often done in larger collaborations and just watching how she would work with a collab with collaborators. Um I think was was a whole different education and and it was a real pleasure to see groups of people who really enjoyed figuring out problems together and thinking together. And I think that was one of the things that was as important for me growing up as watching my my father as a scientist. M

>> how does AI inhibit critical thinking or does it? I think of it as a as a two two-edged. I mean that it can do both and I mean much like you know we I think we might have felt that way about calculators you know originally that we weren't sure should every every student be using calculators because shouldn't they know how to do multiplication and you know division and and and in fact we still teach how to do additions, subtraction, multiplication, division um first but then we we send them loose with the calculators. The tricky thing about AI is that it can give the impression that you've actually learned the basics before you really have and that there's a little danger I think that students may find themselves just relying on it a little bit too soon before they know how to do the the the work themselves, the intellectual work themselves. So I think that's the the danger. Now, the positive is that when you know all these different tools and and approaches to how to think about a problem, AI can often help you find the bit of information that you need um to use these techniques that we're teaching. Um and uh and so I think you know ideally what I'm what I've been asking in this this round as we're teaching the uh this set of we have like you know 24 concepts that we're trying to teach in this critical thinking course that for each one of them I'm asking the students to think very hard about how would you use AI to make it easier to actually operationalize this concept to really use it in your day-to-day life

>> but also how would you use this concept to tell whether or not AI was fooling you and whether the AI was was was putting sending you in the right direction or the wrong because many of them are just tools for thinking about where are we getting where are we getting fooled um and we can be fooling ourselves the AI could be fooling itself and and then could fool us and as we know at least the current generation of AI is very good at being overly confident about uh about what it's saying uh to telling you and then you believe oh well it's a it's a it's typed right there right in the screen it must be right um and yet you need to have that same sense of of gauge of of how much do you trust this result as you would when you're trying to figure out how much do I trust a statement I'm making or a statement that somebody else is making.

>> And I think that's the the game that you have to play um at least with the current version of AI. Um now of course AI will be changing and we'll have to keep we are constantly having to keep asking ourselves is it helping us or are we getting fooled more often? Are we letting ourselves get fooled?

### 宇宙学与天体物理学：宏观与微观的交织

**佩尔穆特**表示，他很喜欢作为**宇宙学家**（Cosmologist: 研究宇宙起源、演化、结构和最终命运的科学家）的身份，因为这让他处于一个非常有趣的位置。他可以运用我们对最小的**基本粒子**（Elementary Particles: 构成物质和力的最基本粒子）和力的理解，来理解宇宙中最大、最宏观的结构。因此，他可以置身于尺度的中间，既能仰望比我们大得多的事物，又能俯视比我们小得多的事物。

主持人询问**宇宙学家**和**天体物理学家**（Astrophysicist: 研究天体物理过程和现象的科学家）的区别。**佩尔穆特**解释说，**天体物理学家**通常研究天空中几乎所有可见事物的物理学，而**宇宙学家**则专门研究宇宙的演化顺序，即事物是如何从过去一步步演变到今天的。**佩尔穆特**本人则兼顾两者。

>> So should we move out into space?

>> Glad to.

>> Is that where you enjoy living? So, I've I've been uh I've been really liking this the fact that um as a cosmologist, you get to you get to be in this really interesting place because you're you're using uh our understanding of the very smallest elementary particles and forces to understand the biggest largest structures um in the universe. And so you get to be sort of nestled right in the middle of scale while you look out at things that are tremendously larger than us and look down into into things that are tremendously smaller than us and and we're in that nice sort of middle place that we get we get to look at both.

>> Stupid question. What's the difference between a cosmo cosmopologist and an astrophysicist?

>> So the astrophysicists um are generally studying the physics and and or of of almost anything that you see in in the sky. Um and uh whereas the cosmologists are are specifically asking the question of um what was the evolutionary order? What how did things uh come about in this order from here to here to here that led to where we are today?

>> And you study both.

### 宇宙的视觉化与无限膨胀的奥秘

当**佩尔穆特**闭上眼睛思考宇宙时，他非常着迷于**爱因斯坦**（Albert Einstein）的**相对论**（Theory of Relativity: 关于空间、时间、引力以及宇宙结构的基本理论）允许三维空间可能存在奇特曲率的事实。这并非我们大脑进化出来能够想象的。所以，我们必须不断强迫自己去想象，看似无限的空间，你可以朝任何方向无限远地旅行，但其中可能存在曲率，最终你可能会回到原点。他喜欢这种“脑筋急转弯”的感觉，那种似懂非懂但又几乎能想象出来的感觉。

在他看来，当前的宇宙几乎完全是空的，在这巨大的空虚中，偶尔会看到一个小点。如果靠近看，你会发现这个点实际上是一个拥有数千亿颗恒星的**星系**（Galaxy: 由恒星、恒星遗迹、星际气体、尘埃和暗物质组成的巨大引力束缚系统）。然后你飞过它，它又消失在背景中，变回一个小点。最终，你会在遥远的未来地平线上看到另一个点，当你越来越近时，你会意识到那是另一个星系。这就是他想象中当前宇宙的景象。而如果回溯到遥远的过去，我们认为宇宙中所有星系之间的空间都被“吸走”了，它们越来越近，直到所有物质都堆积在一起，形成一个可能是无限的、由炽热致密的**基本粒子**组成的“**豌豆汤**”（Pea Soup: 形容早期宇宙物质分布均匀且致密的状态）。在这个时期，宇宙就像一碗非常浓稠的豌豆汤，里面有一些小团块，未来会形成星系，也有一些稍微空旷的地方，但基本上是这些**基本粒子**组成的连续等离子体。

主持人提出一个朴素的问题：一个已经是无限的东西如何还能进一步膨胀？**佩尔穆特**承认，这是一个令所有人困惑的经典问题。当听到“宇宙膨胀”时，首先想到的就是“宇宙是万物，它怎么能膨胀？”唯一的合理解释是，即使是无限的宇宙，你也要想象它在膨胀。今天，正如他所说，有星系，然后有很多空间，再有另一个星系，再有很多空间。在一个膨胀的无限宇宙中，所有这些距离都会变得更远一点。所以，它不是膨胀到任何其他东西中，而是我们正在所有点之间增加额外的空间。这就像从内部给它充气一样，我们只是在我和你之间、在这个星系和下一个星系之间、在所有更远的星系之间，不断地增加更多的空间，因此它稍微变大了。它仍然是无限的，只是所有点之间的空间更多了。

>> When you look at when you think about um space, how do you visualize it? If you close your eyes, just what does it look like? I think that for me I've been very interested in this the fact that Einstein's theory of relativity allows for a for three-dimensional space to possibly have a weird curvature to it. And this isn't something that our brains, you know, are evolved to to picture at all. And so you constantly are having to s force yourself to imagine that there's what looks like infinite space. You're traveling as far as you want some direction, but it's possible that there's curvature in it. You'll find yourself back somewhere where you were before if you just keep going in that direction. And and and I think I always have loved um boggling my own brain. I like I like that feeling of not quite getting something but almost being able to picture it. And I think that for me that's a bit of a of a of a of a odd pleasure, you know. So when you picture it, is it like black with with you like the planets being, you know, lights and suns or just how does it what does it look like? I mean in in some sense the current uh universe to me seems like it's almost entirely empty and every now and then um in this huge empty uh void um you see a little dot and if you go close up to it you realize that that dot is actually a whole pin wheel of a galaxy um with a hundred billion little points of light of stars in them and then you go wishing by it and you then it disappears into the background and goes back to being this little dot and then eventually you see another dot showing up way out there in the future in in in the horizon and you and you get closer and closer and you start realizing oh it's another galaxy and and I think that's for my picture of the current uh universe. Now, if you go way way back in time, um the universe we think was um the space was sucked out between all these galaxies and they were closer and closer and closer until everything was on top of each other and then eventually all the material was on top of each other and eventually you get to the point where it was this

>> possibly infinite soup of of elementary particles that are hot and dense and uh and during that period um it's it's like a a very thick uh almost like a pea soup because it has little clumps where where the galaxies someday eventually form and slightly emptier spots but it's you know basically a non-stop plasma of these of these elementary particles. So those are those are the two different extremes of of time.

>> But of course a naive kind of question is something how can something which is already in infinite expand further. How you

>> I mean that's one of the the biggest standard mindbggling questions that um everybody uh comes to and and you know I certainly have come to it over and over again. Um when you hear the words the universe expands um that's the first thing that comes to mind. Wait the universe is everything. How could it expand? And the only answer that that seems to make any sense is you have to picture even an infinite universe um and you ask yourself okay um today as I said there's galaxy and then there's a lot of space and there's another galaxy and there's a lot of space in another galaxy and in an infinite universe um that's expanding all those distances just get a little bit f further apart. So it we're it's not expanding into anything else. It's that we're adding extra space between all points. So, it's almost like inflating it from the inside. Um, that we're we're just putting more and more space between any two between me and you and between this galaxy and the next galaxy and the and the further galaxies everywhere. We're just adding a little bit extra space and it's slightly bigger um because of that. And uh it's still infinite. Um it's just now there's more space between all the points.

### 火星之旅与宇宙加速膨胀之谜

当被问及如果**埃隆·马斯克**（Elon Musk）邀请他去火星，他是否会去时，**佩尔穆特**表示，他很欣赏那些想去火星的人，但他自己绝不会去。因为他喜欢做很多事情，也喜欢与人一起探索，他不想为了去火星这一件事而放弃所有这些。特别是，如果不能确定能安全返回，那就更不会去了。如果能保证安全返回，并且能健康快乐地继续所有其他探索，那么他绝对会去火星。

关于**大爆炸**（Big Bang: 宇宙起源的理论，认为宇宙从一个极热、极密的状态膨胀而来）发生很久以前，为什么现在宇宙还在加速膨胀？**佩尔穆特**解释说，最初的设想是宇宙在经历快速膨胀后，由于引力作用，膨胀速度会一直减慢。如果真是这样，我们只需要测量减速的程度，就能了解宇宙的密度，从而预测未来。然而，当他们在大约25到30年前开始这个项目并最终进行测量时，却惊讶地发现宇宙不仅没有减速，反而正在加速。这导致了一种预期，即可能存在某种**暗能量**（Dark Energy: 一种假想的能量形式，被认为是导致宇宙加速膨胀的原因），它可能是空虚空间本身的某种属性，或者是一种弥漫在整个空间的新物质或新场，它推动了更快的膨胀和加速。这就是我们所说的**暗能量**。

**暗能量**是过去20年来的一个谜。科学家们一直在测量这种加速的性质，试图弄清楚**暗能量**到底是什么。有大量的理论，据估计，在过去20到25年里，平均每24小时就有一篇关于**暗能量**的新理论论文发表。因此，理论数量远多于约束条件和测量数据。他们花了大约20年时间开发这些项目，现在正准备在未来5到10年内进行所有他们希望在20年前就能进行的测量，以开始区分**暗能量**的可能性质。

>> If Ellen Musk asked you to go to Mars, would you go? I'm somebody who um loves the fact that there are people who would like to go to Mars, but I would never go and because I because there's so many things I enjoy doing that I'm I and I enjoy coming across and getting to explore with people that I would hate to give all that up just for this one thing uh you know the the one exploration of that of that of just going to Mars. Uh but especially because you don't get to know that you got to go back, you know, no,

>> right? I mean, if they promised,

>> you have to assume there was a drone ticket there,

>> right? Right. Right. If you promised that you could you that you could certainly get back and you' be and you'd be happy and healthy and you get to do all the other explorations, then absolutely I would go to Mars. You know,

>> given the big bang happened so long ago, why does it accelerate now?

>> So, the original picture um that we had started with when we were doing the measurements that that uh that we were talking about that led to our current uh understanding. Um the original picture had it that the universe begins um with a very rapid expansion that we can explain where we think it comes from but then has been slowing down ever since because gravity will attract everything else. And then if that were the case then the only thing that we really need to know about to to figure out the future is to measure how much it's slowing down because that tells us how dense the universe is and that's gravitationally slowing the expansion. So that's what we thought we were um setting out to measure back when we started that project. Oh, 25 no 30 some odd years ago. Um and then when we made when we actually finally got to the point that we could make the measurement um we found the surprise that actually the universe is not slowing down, it's speeding up. So what that led to is a expectation that there's some property um perhaps of empty space itself. But right at the moment, we're thinking uh it could be a new substance, a new field through that's spread throughout space that actually powers a a more rapid expansion and acceleration. And that's what we're calling dark energy.

>> And what is that?

>> And that's the mystery of the past 20 years. So we've seen uh that the this acceleration is happening. And so what we've been starting to do for the past 20 years is try to measure um properties of that acceleration to see if we can figure out what is what that dark energy could be. Um there there's well a huge number of theories. I think there was a I think it was estimating that in the last 20 years 25 years there's been a on average a new um theoretical paper about the dark energy written every 24 hours um published for you know um in the last 25 years. Um, and so there's way more theories than there is uh than there are constraints and measurements. And it's taken us 20 years or so of developing these projects to the point that we're just now um about to be entering the next 5 years or 10 years. Um we'll be making all the measurements that we were hoping to make for 20 years ago that we we're intending to start telling apart what could be the stark energy.

### 长期研究的动力与团队竞赛

**佩尔穆特**的研究项目历时长久，在1998年发表成果之前，他曾有三年没有任何突破。他解释说，这个项目实际上始于1987年，当时他们首次提出了测量方案。他们认为这将是一个艰难的项目，预计需要三年时间，并需要30颗**超新星**（Supernova: 某些恒星生命末期发生的剧烈爆炸，亮度极高）来完成测量。然而，三年后，他们一颗**超新星**都没有找到。直到五年后，他们才获得了第一个测量精确的优秀样本。但那时，他们已经学会了如何批量进行这些测量。所以在接下来的三年里，他们每年收集了十几颗甚至更多的**超新星**，直到最终获得所需的数据。

**超新星**是一种惊人的工具，因为它们可以在整个宇宙中被观测到，而且他们使用的这种类型亮度一致，是非常好的测量工具。但它们也是非常麻烦的研究工具，因为它们在任何星系中何时爆炸都没有预警，而且每个星系每隔几百年才会爆炸一次。它们在几周内亮度达到峰值，然后在约一个月内消退。所以，你必须在它们亮度上升期间捕捉到它们，才能测量其峰值亮度。因此，它们是你能想象到的最令人烦恼的研究工具。这就是为什么他们花了这么长时间才学会如何将它们作为一种非常标准的工具来使用，以便能够持续地大量发现和研究它们。

**佩尔穆特**的团队曾与另一个团队展开竞争。最初，他们鼓励大家参与这个伟大的项目，但很快另一个团队也加入了进来。这使得他们陷入了一场竞赛，因为世界上只有少数几台望远镜具备他们所需的能力，而两个团队都在申请使用相同的望远镜，甚至有时会在机场擦肩而过。这是一场非常激烈的竞争。尽管如此，两个团队的领导者会相互抱怨维持团队有效运作的困难。他们至少有两次在恶劣天气下相互帮助：一次是对方团队遭遇恶劣天气，他们帮助进行了观测；另一次是他们自己遭遇恶劣天气，对方团队帮助他们完成了观测任务。最终，两个团队在几周内相继公布了相同的结果，被认为是共同发现，并共同分享了**诺贝尔奖**。

>> We talked earlier about the importance of believing in yourself. Now you spent three years without any breakthroughs uh researching uh these kind of things before you published in 98. How do you keep a team motivated to just kind of go on and on?

>> Yeah. Yeah. No, it was worse than that. In fact, um we started the project. So the n the 98 result started in 80 87 was when we first proposed the measurement and we thought it was going to be a hard project. We thought that was going to take three years because we were going to need 30 of these exploding star supernova to make the measurement with. At the end of three years, we had zero supernova, not 30. Um, and it was only after five years that we had um really de excellent first one that was well measured. And then but by then we'd learned how to make the um how to make batches of of these measurements. And so for the next three years, we collected a dozen or or more a year until we finally had the numbers that we needed to to to get the answer. And when you have one of these, how long time do you have to measure it and to

>> Oh, the well the these exploding stars, the supernova, they're they're amazing tools because you can see them across the universe and they and the the kind that we're using is all the same brightness and they make a great measuring tool, but they're a terrible thing to work with because um they don't let no warning about when they're going to explode in any galaxy uh around. They only explode every few hundred thou a few hundred years um in any given galaxy that you're that you're looking at. Um and uh and they rise in just a couple weeks and they fade away within, you know, a month or so. And so, and you have to catch them during that rise. So, you can measure them at their peak brightness. And uh and so they're the the most annoying research tool that you can imagine. And that's why it took so long for us to get to the point of knowing how to work with them as a as a very standard uh tool where we could turn out many of them all all the time and and study them. Because we talked about because we briefly talked about this when we when we discussed the importance of having a backup uh you know for these books and you said well you knew when you when you look at these you know these explosions you better have film in your camera right because

>> exactly and we used to do uh you know all sorts of things to make sure that we were that we would be that you know on those rare nights that we happen to be there at the telescope and there was a supernova that everything was going to work and we had teams of people flying out you know from one part of the world to another because that's where the telescopes were at that time that we had to fly to and we had teams of people back at the lab who were collecting the data from the parts different parts of the world and giving instructions for what they were seeing and what they recommended. Um so it was it was a bit of a show uh during during that period.

>> Talking about show I mean you and you raced against another team right?

>> That's right. So how did that uh impact the process?

>> It well at the beginning we we were it was funny because in the early days um we were trying to say this is a great project. everybody should be doing this. And then pretty soon another team was doing it. And that meant that now we were in a bit of a race because um there were only a few telescopes in the world that had the capabilities of doing what we wanted. And we were now both applying to use the same telescopes. In fact, we would sometimes pass each other in the airports going to these telescopes. Um and so it was a very toughly fought uh uh you know race.

>> Were you were you friendly with them? I mean did you say hi when you passed them at the airport?

>> Well well yes. Um but there there was you know some parts of it that were very conflictual and very you know people give each other a very hard time at the conferences. Um um but the for example the other leader of the other team and myself we would commiserate with each other about how difficult it was to keep our whole teams working uh effectively um you know independently and uh and we did at least on two occasions uh where we had we all depend on the weather when we're doing astronomy from the ground. And so we, you know, one one time they uh had terrible weather and that meant they were going to lose um everything they've been working for for that that particular sequence of searching and then following. And so we took some observations for them um so they could keep going. And then there's another time where we got bad weather and we traded times, we traded nights with uh with my uh counterpart, the leader of the other team. Um so they could help us be able to stay on our uh trajectory of of how many nights we had to keep observing.

>> And then you and then you share the prize

>> and then and then at the end the two teams came up with the same result um and announced it within weeks of each other. and and so in the end it was accepted as a a joint discovery and so uh the two the two teams shared the prize.

### 客观真理与科学进步

**佩尔穆特**认为，科学之所以能够取得所有进步，是因为它非常认真地对待**客观真理**（Objective Truth: 独立于个人信念、情感或视角而存在的现实）的理念。存在一个我们试图理解的外部世界，我们无法直接接触它，只能通过眼睛、仪器、工具和测量来观察。我们建立模型来描述这个外部世界的**客观真理**。但无论我们是否理解，这个世界都会按照自己的方式运行。我们的模型不会完全正确，几乎永远无法捕捉到一切。它们必须是简化版本，以便我们的大脑能够理解外部世界的某个方面。我们可能无法一次性全面理解，所以我们总是通过小窗口、小模型来理解外部世界。

但与此同时，我们之所以能取得进步，是因为我们都相信**客观真理**的存在，无论我们怎么想。我们不能只是各自退到房间的角落，说“你相信你想相信的，我相信我想相信的”，然后科学就不需要达成一致。在科学中，我们需要达成一致，因为只有这样，我们才能发现错误，从而改进我们对外部世界现实的理解模型。因此，世界的**客观真理**实际上是我们不同项目之间的纽带，它让我们有机会找出哪些是更正确的，哪些是更可能错误的。

>> It's kind of beautiful. No,

>> I think I mean in some sense at the time, you know, everybody was saying to me, "Oh, you've got to you know, get you get yours out, you know, for first because otherwise you're going to have to share the prize and etc." And I and I was thinking, but in the end, you know, it was a relatively small community of people who were doing this kind of work and we were all dependent on each other in some sense for different things that we were contributing. And so it was the right it it was a very warm outcome in the end because it felt like it honored a big fraction of the community got honored by the by these two teams.

>> S is there an objective truth?

>> I think that the way science has been able to make all of its progress is by taking very seriously the idea that there is a world out there that is the thing that we're trying to figure out and that we don't get direct access to it. We get to see what we can see through our eyes, through our instruments, and through our tools and our measurements. And we build up our models of what that ex what that objective truth is of the world out there. Um, but it's going to do its thing whether we get it or not. And our models are going to be not quite right. They'll almost never capture everything. And for one thing, they've got to be simplifications just for our brains to understand some aspect of the world that's out there. We probably can't get it take it all in all at one time. So, we're always using little windows, little models of of what's going on out there.

>> But at the same time, um I think we make progress because we all believe that it's there no matter what we think. And that we can't just go to our separate corners of the room and say, "Okay, you believe what you want to believe and I'll believe what I want to believe." And you know, our science doesn't have to agree. Um in the science, there's a real need for us to agree because we have to um because that's where we figure out where we're making our mistakes. And it improves our picture of our model of what the reality is out there in the world.

>> And so the objective truth of the world is actually I think what provides the the link between our different uh our different projects that gives us the chance to figure out things that are more right and more likely to be wrong.

### 拥抱不确定性：年轻人的机遇

世界是否比以前更不确定？**佩尔穆特**认为，世界一直是不确定的，这在某种意义上是人类的境况。我们成长过程中不知道会发生什么，不知道自己会怎样，也不知道周围会发生什么。在某些方面，我们通过文明的进步，使越来越多的细小部分变得可控，从而能够相当确定地掌控它们。但世界总会给我们带来意想不到的“曲线球”，我们不知道会发生什么。我们的任务当然是足够灵活，能够管理所有这些不确定性，而不是让它们吓倒我们，而是让我们觉得那正是我们茁壮成长的地方，我们靠着管理不确定性而生存。

在科学领域，年轻人的优势在于，每一代新人都能带来巨大的优势。至少有一半的机会，他们不会陷入前人理解中的错误。他们也像**佩尔穆特**所说的，去寻找那些与你意见不合的人，让他们给你制造麻烦。年轻人通常乐于向长辈指出他们犯的错误。**佩尔穆特**承认，每当有人给他制造麻烦时，他的第一反应总是“哦，算了吧”。但有时，你不得不承认他们可能是对的。对于那些初出茅庐的年轻人，他们会说“现在轮到我们了，我们要接管并做这件事”，你可能会想“哦，算了吧，你不知道怎么做”。但最终，有时他们正是你当时需要的正确元素。

>> what's the benefit of being of youth in science

>> I think that you get so much advantage of having bringing in new generations year after year decade after decade um in into any field, any topic because um there's at least a half chance that they won't get stuck in the mistakes that the previous understanding made and they also are acting a little bit like when I said that it's very important to go find the people you disagree with and so they can give you a hard time. It's also true that there's a pleasure in usually in the young trying to show the the old uh the older that they that they made a mistake.

>> And do you never think hey who are you to teach me? I've got a Nobel Prize. I'm a superstar and you're just a youngster straight out of go, you know, university

You know, um first of all, you know, that that other team, they they don't know what they're talking about. They're giving me they're there's, you know, showing they're claiming I made a mistake. Um you know, I'm sure they made a mistake, you know, and then some of the time you you have to actually look at and go, you know, I think maybe they are right. Same thing with the, you know, fresh, you know, young Turk that comes into the thing and they they say, you know, okay, it's our turn. We're gonna we're gonna take over and do this thing and and you think, "Oh, come on. You you don't know how to do that." And of course, in the end, some of the time, they they're the right they're the right ingredient that you need at that moment.

### 给年轻人的建议：积极塑造未来

**佩尔穆特**给年轻人的建议是：尽可能抛开新闻中常常呈现的可怕方面，因为新闻的设计就是为了制造恐惧，以此吸引观众。相反，我们应该认识到，我们一直生活在一个复杂而不确定的世界中，而我们正在越来越善于驾驭和应对它。我们有机会与他人合作，共同创造我们想要生活的世界。他认为，对于这一代的年轻人来说，现在正是你们的时刻。不要被长辈们口中的“末日论”所吓倒。你们应该说，这些都是我们可以应对的挑战。我们现在知道如何处理各种规模的问题，这些问题与我们的恐惧和目标相匹配。这些都是我们可以管理的事情。所以，你们应该积极投入，并尝试带动长辈们一起参与。让他们少一些担忧，多一些建设性的参与，共同思考如何创造我们想要生活的世界。

>> And given that, what is uh what is your advice to young people? Oh, well I mean I my my sense is that if you can at all um put aside all of the scary aspects of the news that is often presented to you because the news is designed to be scary because I think that's how they make they get get you to watch. Um and if instead you can say we have always lived in a complicated um uncertain world and we are just getting better and better at learning how to ride on it and and work with it and we have this option opportunity and this option to work with other people to make a world that we that we want to live in. I think this is your moment. I mean, as as a a young person coming in this generation, you should not get turned off by all the doom and gloom that you might be hearing from the from the elders. I mean, you should be saying those are the challenges that we can deal with. We now know the how to do all sorts of things that are on the scale of these fears and these goals. Those are things we can we can manage. And so, you should jump jump in and join and try to bring the elders with you. I mean, try and get them to uh to be a little less worried but a little bit more constructively engaged, you know, in trying to think of how are we going to make the world the world we would like to live in.

>> Well, that's a perfect place to end. It's always been a privilege to be allowed to interview you. Big thanks.
