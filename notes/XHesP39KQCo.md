### 童年启蒙与星际探索的偶然交汇

Jill Tarter，作为SETI研究所的荣誉主任，其职业生涯始于对工程学的早期兴趣，并最终走向了地外智慧生命搜索（SETI）这一宏伟事业。她的童年生活充满了矛盾与平衡：父亲热爱户外活动，带她打猎、钓鱼、露营；而母亲则来自时尚零售业，喜欢把她打扮得漂漂亮亮。这种独特的成长环境塑造了她独立思考的性格。八岁那年，她与父亲的一次“洗衣机上的谈话”成为了她人生轨迹的关键转折点。面对母亲希望她多做“女孩的事情”的建议，Tarter坚定地表达了不愿受限的愿望，并立志成为一名工程师。尽管当时她对工程师的具体工作并不了解，但父亲工程师朋友们幸福的生活让她对这个职业充满了向往。

不幸的是，几年后父亲的离世，让她过早地领悟了**“及时行乐”**（Carpe Diem: 抓住当下，享受生活）的道理。这促使她更加坚定地追求工程学学位，并在康奈尔大学完成了五年的工程学教育。然而，在研究生阶段，她发现自己对传统工程学兴趣寥寥，甚至觉得教授们“无聊”。她决定利用所学的问题解决能力，寻找更有趣的领域。机缘巧合之下，她选修了**埃德温·萨尔彼得**（Edwin Salpeter）关于恒星形成与生命周期的课程，并被深深吸引，从此投身于天体物理学。她童年时在佛罗里达海滩仰望星空，想象着遥远星球上也有生命同样仰望星辰的经历，也为她后来的宇宙观奠定了基础。真正让她与SETI结缘的，是一系列“快乐的意外”。在加州大学伯克利分校读研期间，她学会了操作当时最先进的**PDP-8/S**（PDP-8/S: 第一台真正的桌面计算机，需直接编程二进制代码）计算机。多年后，这台被淘汰的设备被X射线天文学家**斯图尔特·鲍耶**（Stuart Bowyer）获得，他正寻求利用伯克利的射电望远镜进行地外生命搜索。鲍耶得知Tarter曾编程过这台机器，便邀请她加入SETI项目，即**SERENDIP**（SERENDIP: 早期SETI项目名称）项目，她也因此成为了该项目处理引擎的程序员。此后，她在NASA艾姆斯研究中心与**约翰·比林厄姆**（John Billingham）合作，正式开启了她致力于地外生命搜索的职业生涯，并自称是这项事业的“首席啦啦队长”。

- My name is Jill Tarter, and I'm officially retired, and so my title is Emeritus Director of SETI Research at the SETI Institute. And, of course, SETI's an acronym that stands for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. - [Narrator] Chapter 1. Origins of a Cosmic Detective. - Well, I actually didn't do a whole lot with electronics. I did a lot more hunting and fishing and camping with my dad. And then where all of these pictures in our photo albums from when I was a kid where I'll be standing there in a beautifully starched little dress with ruffled lace socks and Mary Janes on my feet holding up a big fish, right? Because these were the tensions in my life growing up. My dad was an outdoorsman and my mother had been involved in the fashion industry and retail, so she dressed me up and then I went out and went fishing with my dad. So I had a great childhood though. And maybe, let's see, I think I was about eight years old and my dad said, "We have to have a talk." Clearly my mother had talked to him the night before, and so we had this washing machine talk, when my dad and I wanted to talk, he'd set me up on top of a washing machine so that we'd be eye to eye. And he said, you know, "Your mom thinks that you're getting older and you should be spending more time doing girl things rather than spending time with me," and I just exploded. I mean, you couldn't have said anything that would've made me angrier. I said, "That's not fair. Why can't I do both? It's just ridiculous. You shouldn't have to choose one or the other." And, you know, of course, then I started to cry 'cause at eight years old, I knew if you wanted your dad on your side, right, the tears always help. And so we continued this conversation for a long time and he finally said, "Okay, all right, if you're willing to work really hard, then you can do anything you wanna do." And I said, "Okay, I'm gonna be an engineer." Now, I don't really think I knew what engineers did, but I knew my dad had a lot of friends, now friends who were engineers and they seemed to have happy lives. So I said, "Okay, I'm gonna be an engineer." Then sadly, my dad died a couple of years later and I learned a really important lesson, which is the carpe diem lesson that most people end up learning a bit later in life. But, you know, I always thought my dad was gonna be there and if I didn't ask him the question today, I could ask him the question tomorrow. Well, it doesn't always work that way. And then I had told my dad I was gonna be an engineer, and then I just got stubborn about it and I said, "Okay, I'm gonna be an engineer." And so I went through five years of engineering school at Cornell and got an engineering degree. I got a really good education in problem solving, but it turns out I didn't really like the engineering so much. And in addition, I looked around when I was thinking about graduate school and I said, "Hmm, if in general, engineers are as boring as my professors, I'm gonna find some other problems to work on with these great skills that I've acquired." And so then I started taking all kinds of different courses in graduate school and ended up taking a course from Edwin Salpeter on the star formation and the lifecycle of stars, and I was just hooked. I thought, stars live and die, right? I thought that was amazing, to be able to study the lifecycle of a star. And so that's what put me into astrophysics. I just had a lot of fortunate, lucky circumstances. I usually describe myself as the chief cheerleader for all things having to do with searching for life beyond Earth. And we have different ways of doing that. Astrobiologists look for what they call biosignatures, trying to discern some disequilibrium chemistry in the atmospheres of planets orbiting other stars. And in my case, teams that I've worked with looked for technosignatures. They look for evidence that someone or something out there has developed a technology and that we might be able to detect that technology even over the vast distances between the stars. And we've been doing this for a while now, and I've been cheerleading all the way and I don't intend to stop anytime soon. When I was about eight years old, I was down in the Florida Keys, the West Coast of Florida with my aunt and uncle who were literally beachcombers. And my dad was there and he was the center of my universe. And I remember one night walking along the edge of the gulf holding my dad's hand and looking up in the sky and seeing these magnificent stars because it was a very dark site. There were no streetlights back then. And I just had this idea that on some planet around one of those stars, there would be a creature walking along the edge of an ocean with their parent looking up and seeing our sun as a star in their sky. And I know what set of circumstances led me to have that particular worldview, but it's been with me for a long time. And then I did an engineering undergraduate degree and a PhD in astrophysics and was nowhere near SETI until a very happy accident happened. My first year in graduate school, UC Berkeley acquired the first real desktop computer that had ever been manufactured, the PDP-8/S. And it had no language. You had to program the 11 things that it could do by setting all the ones and zeros. We had to program it NODIL. And I learned to do that. It's kind of a weird skill, but I learned to do that my first year in graduate school. And much, much later as I was finally getting ready to finish my graduate degree, that piece of equipment, that computer was obsolete and it was given to an x-ray astronomer by the name of Stuart Bowyer, who had been following NASA's workshops on looking for life beyond the Earth. And he said, "Wow, UC Berkeley has a radio astronomy telescope, right, that's up at Hat Creek?" And my friend Jack Welch runs that. And so he figured out a way that we could take the data in parallel with the astronomers and we could analyze it, or that Stu could analyze it, looking for signals that were engineered as opposed to astrophysical. That's a great idea. But he had no money. And so he went begging and someone gave him this old computer and he said, "What the heck do I do with that?" And somebody said, "Ah, Jill's still here. Ah, she used to program that thing." And so he came and recruited me to work on his SETI project, which was called SERENDIP at Hat Creek Observatory. And I programmed that PDP-8 to be the processing engine for that search. So it was just a delightful accident. And, of course, then I went off to do a postdoc at NASA Ames, ran into John Billingham who was starting up the, what did he call it, the Interstellar Communication Committee at NASA Ames. And I said, "Hey John, there are more than 40 hours in a week and I'd like to volunteer with your group and see what you're doing," and so that was it. I've never had any other job except thinking about life beyond Earth. I mean, I never set out to have this as a career path, but I can't think of anything more exciting to work on. And there I was in the right place with the right set of skills, engineering and astrophysics, and we were off to the races.

### 克服性别偏见：女性科学家的成长之路

在康奈尔大学的求学生涯中，Jill Tarter作为一名女性工程师，面临着诸多挑战和不平等待遇。作为新生，她所在的女生宿舍晚上十点宵禁，早上六点才开门，这意味着她无法像男同学那样集体讨论作业，只能独自学习。然而，这种“被隔离”的状态反而让她在技术上获得了更扎实的教育，尽管社交上略显笨拙。在课堂上，作为唯一的女性，她备受关注。教授们都认识她，甚至会让她去为同学们争取作业延期。更令人震惊的是，她曾被要求不要参加核物理课程，因为课程将讨论辐射对男性生育能力的影响，认为她的在场会不便。她反驳道：“那女性生育能力呢？”这凸显了当时普遍存在的性别歧视。

另一个令人尴尬的经历发生在一次工程学课程上。她的母亲像小时候送她去夏令营一样，在她的所有衣服上都缝上了“Jill Cornell”的姓名标签，其中一个标签缝在她披在肩上的毛衣内侧。当她把毛衣搭在椅背上时，标签不小心翻了出来，上面原本写着“100% virgin wool”（100%纯羊毛），但母亲的姓名标签正好盖住了“wool”一词，结果变成了“100% virgin”（100%处女）。这让她在300人的课堂上成为了笑柄，感到无地自容。更严重的打击发生在大学三年级，她决定与实验室助教结婚后，原本资助她的**宝洁公司**（Procter & Gamble: 美国消费品巨头）奖学金被撤销。宝洁认为她结婚后会成为家庭主妇，不再认真从事科学研究，因此不愿继续资助。面对这一不公，Tarter找到了时任工程学院院长、后来成为康奈尔大学校长的**戴尔·科森**（Dale Corson）。科森院长深明大义，为她争取回了奖学金。二十年后，当她作为顾问委员会成员协助科森校长管理阿雷西博望远镜时，她再次向他表达了感谢，证明了他当年的信任对她人生的巨大影响。这些经历不仅塑造了她的韧性，也让她对性别平等有了更深刻的理解。

First of all, being a woman was the first part of it, which meant that at Cornell as a freshman in the dormitories, I was locked in at 10 o'clock at night and they didn't open the doors until six in the morning, which meant that I was sitting there by myself while all my male colleagues were over in their dorms or in restaurants or bars or something, doing all the problem sets as a group, you know, you take the evens, I'll take the odds kind of thing. But I didn't have that because I was locked in and working on my own. So I got a better education, technically. It didn't do me very well socially, right? I was a bit socially awkward. And then there were all kinds of interesting situations in the classroom. First of all, all the professors knew me 'cause I was singular. I was sitting there in this sea of male faces. They didn't know most of the male students, at least not early on. So if people wanted an extension on an assignment, they'd send me to go ask for the extension. And that was a little awkward, but I did get to know my professors a little bit better. And, you know, there was the day when I was asked not to come to my nuclear physics class the next day because they were going to discuss the dangers of radiation and male sterility and they just couldn't do that in my presence. And I went, what about female sterility? Come on guys. Oh, things like, I think I told Sarah Scoles first year engineering problems and methods, a required course, everybody had to take it, a lecture room with 300 people, and I was an only child. My mother was very protective of me as she sent me off to Cornell. And so just the way she used to do when she sent me off to camp as a younger person, she sewed little name tags "Jill Cornell" into all of my clothes, and in particular onto a label of a sweater that I had thrown over my shoulders. And then I flipped it off over the back of my seat and suddenly we hear this little ripple of tittering and laughter going back from me towards the back of the auditorium and then down the other side. And finally, the professor stopped his lecture and he said, "What's going on?" Thanks, mom. The label in the sweater had originally said 100% virgin wool, but my mother put my name tape over the word wool. And so they all then knew that I was 100% virgin. It was one of those moments where you just hope the floor would open up and swallow you whole, but of course it didn't and you got through it and got some laughs out of it later. It was a little... I got good grades 'cause I'm locked in my dorm room working by myself. And so there was a lot of tension because my grades were better than many of my other colleagues or students. And then in my junior year, I made a decision that I was gonna get married to the man who had been my lab instructor from my freshman physics class. And he was in graduate school and we knew that I was gonna go to graduate school and we sat down and we worked out all of our finances and we said we could do this, we could make this happen, partially because I was on a full scholarship from Procter & Gamble, one of those is given each year in the engineering school and one is given in the arts school. And I had the engineering scholarship and it was fantastic. Tuition fees, books, all of that kind of thing. And so we obviously counted on that. But when Procter & Gamble found out that I was planning on getting married at the end of my junior year, they took the scholarship away. They said, "You're not serious. You're not gonna be a scientist. You know, we're not gonna waste this money on educating you just to go be a housewife and have babies." Ugh, wow, that was a devastating blow. So I went to the dean of the engineering college, his name was Dale Corson, and who later became president of Cornell University. And I said, "Dean Corson, this isn't fair. I mean, I've been on dean's list every semester. I'm a good student and I intend to continue to be a student and a graduate student and a scientist or engineer." And he looked at me and he kindly said, "You know, you're right. It isn't fair. It isn't fair at all." And I have no idea what he said when he called up the folks at Procter & Gamble, but he got my scholarship back for me. It was wonderful, you know, and I thanked him profusely at that point. And then 20 years later when he was president of Cornell and had an advisory committee to help him decide how to run the Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico, which sadly we've just lost now, it's collapsed, but back then, I was on that advisory committee. And so I was able to come up to him all those years later and say, "See, President Corson, thank you for believing in me. I didn't just drop out and become a housewife and have kids. You know, I'm on your advisory committee for this fantastic telescope and I have to thank you once again," and that felt so good. It felt wonderful to be able to tell him that he'd made such a difference in my life.

### 宇宙视角：SETI的科学演进与深远意义

在Jill Tarter的职业生涯中，宇宙似乎变得越来越“生物友好”。过去，我们只知道太阳系有九大行星（后来冥王星被降级），而现在，我们发现银河系中的行星数量远超恒星。此外，**极端微生物**（Extremophiles: 在极端环境下生存的生命形式）的发现彻底改变了我们对生命存在条件的认知，证明生命可以在过去被认为完全贫瘠的环境中繁衍。这些发现使得“在所有这些潜在宜居的宇宙地产中，是否真的有生命存在？”这一问题变得自然而然。Tarter坚信，本世纪我们有机会回答这个问题，尽管她可能无法亲眼见证结局，但她对年轻一代科学家充满期待。

SETI的使命是寻找**技术信号**（Technosignatures: 证明地外文明存在的技术证据），而非直接定义或探测智慧本身。我们寻找的是自然界无法产生，但技术文明可以产生的独特信号模式。例如，在无线电波段，我们寻找集中在单一频率上的信号，而非像自然现象那样分散在多个频率上；在光学波段，我们寻找持续纳秒或微秒的明亮脉冲，这是激光技术所能产生的。为了区分这些潜在的**地外信号**（Extraterrestrial Signals: 源自地球以外的技术文明的信号）与地球自身的干扰（如卫星传输），SETI团队投入了大量计算资源。Tarter认为，最佳方法是使用相距数百甚至上千公里的两台望远镜同时观测同一天区，通过信号在两台望远镜之间因地球自转产生的**多普勒频移**（Doppler Shift: 由于发射源与接收器相对运动导致频率变化的现象）差异来验证其真实性。

展望未来，Tarter对将**人工智能**（Artificial Intelligence: 模拟人类智能的机器系统）引入SETI搜索充满期待。通过将数据可视化为二维图像（频率对时间），我们可以利用AI的图像识别技术，以无偏见的方式寻找数据中的任何非噪声模式，从而发现目前我们敏感度较低的各种调制方案，极大地拓宽搜索范围。SETI的最终目标是回答人类在宇宙中是否孤独的问题。Tarter认为，我们不太可能找到技术水平低于我们的文明，而更有可能探测到比我们先进得多的技术，因为银河系中的大多数恒星都比太阳古老十亿年。对她而言，SETI的真正意义在于，如果成功探测到信号，就意味着技术文明能够拥有长远的未来，这能激励人类克服当前地球面临的诸多挑战，实现可持续发展。

Over my career, I've been able to watch the universe appear to become more bio-friendly. We don't know that it is, that's what we're trying to find out. But over my career, we have discovered planets around other stars, exoplanets. When we started, we only knew about nine in our solar system. And then we demoted one of those. But now we know that in the Milky Way Galaxy, there are more planets than there are stars. And additionally, we now know about organisms that we call extremophiles, forms of life, not just microscopic, but a lot of them macroscopic, living in environments which when I was a student, I was taught utterly no chance. That's gonna be sterile. No reason to look for life there. But, of course, life is there and it's amazing. So exoplanets and extremophiles, right, two big game changers. And now it makes it just seem natural to ask the question. Well, with all that potentially habitable real estate out there, is any of it actually inhabited? And so that's just the most natural thing now that we have a different worldview of our cosmos than we did 40 years ago. And so I'm excited. We have a real opportunity in this century to answer that "are any of them inhabited" question. And so I find that really exciting. It makes me mad to be old because I probably am not going to be around long enough to see the end of that story or the beginning of the next phase of our searching. But young people, graduate students now are going to have a really exciting way forward in this century. SETI could succeed tomorrow, but the instruments that are needed for finding disequilibrium chemistry in the atmospheres of exoplanets, those are gonna take a while to build. And then it's gonna take another generation to be big enough to actually do the job. For me, the fun part was getting started with this, right? Helping to, you know, roll this rock up the mountain, right? So I've had the privilege of being in at the beginning, and because I'm a big frog in a small pond, I've had the opportunity to decide a lot of different things about what we should do. And you don't get out of bed in the morning saying, ah, you know, today, I'm gonna get a signal today, because you're probably gonna go to bed disappointed. But you do get out of bed in the morning saying, ah, today, I'm gonna figure out how to do this better. We're gonna do something that we couldn't do last week. We're gonna figure out how we can do it today and then how we can do it better next week. And so that's really satisfying. And I've known all along in this business that I'm probably gonna have to train my replacement because this is not a small task that we're undertaking. This is a really large search, and our tools for doing the search are getting better all the time and now exponentially faster because computing is improving so rapidly. So didn't go into this thinking that, well, you know, it'll be a good thing to do for the first five years of my career and then I'll find something else to do. Now, I've pretty much understood from the beginning and everybody who works on this program understands that we are probably in this for the long haul. And so we try and find ways to reach out to young engineers and students and excite them about the potential of doing this kind of work. It's not everybody's cup of tea, right? People sometimes approach their science as, I'm gonna do something, I'm gonna publish a paper, I'm gonna do something else, I'm gonna publish a paper, and I'm gonna be successful all along the way. And sometimes they're wise enough to think, and I'll do something wrong and I'll learn from that, but this idea of working on something that might not succeed during your career is a little dicey and it takes a certain kind of personality to be eager to do that. And then, of course, there's the other shoe, which is the funding for this activity is anything but stable. And so not only do I have to say, "Come join us," no, you might not succeed with finding a signal in your career, and hmm, maybe I can't make salary next month, right? So that's another challenge we'd like to, now in my cheerleading role, I'd like to work on establishing an endowment so that this kind of activity, this scientific exploration can be funded stably into the future because that's what it's probably gonna take. - [Narrator] Chapter 2: SETI The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. - SETI, the acronym is the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. But that's actually a misnomer. We don't know how to define intelligence. We certainly don't know how to detect it at a distance. What we can perhaps do is find evidence of someone else's technology that is detectable over these vast distances between the stars. So we should actually call it SETT, but SETI's has been around for a while and has brand recognition and we're not changing that anytime soon, but we are looking for evidence of technologies. And there are a couple of things that we've done in the past and new things that we're gonna be trying to do in the future. We've been looking for electromagnetic radiation, signals, either at radio wavelengths or at optical wavelengths. But we're specifically looking for the kinds of signals that as far as we know, nature can't produce, but our technologies do it all the time. So in the radio part of the spectrum, and that means that we're looking for frequency compression, for power that shows up at exactly one channel on the radio dial. It isn't spread out over many channels, which is what nature would do, but it's a single channel. And in the optical, we look for time compression. We look for bright pulses that last for a nanosecond or a microsecond. And again, this is something that as far as we know nature can't do, but lasers sure can. And so we build instrumentation to put behind radio telescopes or optical telescopes that split the incoming signal, which is voltage is a function of time, split it up into many, many different channels, or we sample the optical telescope very, very, very quickly so we can detect these compressions in frequency. We can see a signal that shows up at one frequency and it may over time change its frequency because the Earth is rotating and there's a Doppler shift between the transmitter and the receiver. And because of the rotation, there's also a Doppler drift and the frequency changes. So we write software that's looking for those particular patterns, and likewise in the optical. We look for bright flashes that show up only at one point and then may not show up again. So you have to be very careful in this kind of work about deciding whether or not what you have detected, what shows up in your data, is actually real, coming from the sky, moving the way the stars move on the sky at what we call sidereal rate, or whether what you're finding in your data is coming from your own equipment, noise that you generate, or that satellites orbiting the Earth generate. And so we have this problem of deciding whether what we've detected is us or them. And over time, that gets to be more and more problematic as there are more satellites orbiting, which not only make the night sky bright with flashes, but make it very loud in the radio because of the transmissions from those satellites. And so we've had to try and get clever over the years and we certainly spend a good half of our computing resources trying to discriminate between us and them. And I've long thought that the best way to do this is in the radio to use two telescopes, that are separated by hundreds of kilometers, sometimes even 1,000 kilometers, and they're both looking at the same place on the sky simultaneously. And then if you find a signal in your primary telescope, you look at the data from the secondary telescope and you look to see if that signal is also found by the other telescope with the appropriate shift in frequency and drift that would be due to the differential Doppler of the Earth's rotation. And then in the optical, because we're looking for single events, you know, a single bright pulse, you also want to use multiple telescopes and you want to use the simultaneity with the light travel time between the telescopes taken into account. You want to use that simultaneous detection as your verification that this is something that's really coming from the sky. And now we're on a threshold where we can begin to think about using artificial intelligence to help us with this search. So in my searches, we have done our signal detection always in near real time so that as soon as we have something, we can immediately follow up on it. This has turned out to be one of the best discriminants against interference for us. But now what we want to do is use, instead of saying, is there this particular narrow band pattern in the data, now we wanna use machine intelligence to look at the data in a bias-free way and say, not is there this pattern, but is there any pattern? Is there anything other than noise in these data? And that will open up the search to all kinds of different modulation schemes that we have very little sensitivity to at the moment. By displaying the data as frequency versus time, as a two-dimensional image, then we can use all of these wonderful techniques that are being developed for artificial intelligence, for image recognition. And I think that's going to open up a lot of new channels for SETI research in the future. Because we're interested in ourselves, we're infinitely interested in humans, right? And we want to know how we stack up against the cosmos. Are we unique? Are we one of many? And if we're one of many, how intelligent are we relative to somebody else or something else out there? You know, in terms of technology, we can't find anybody out there whose technology is less advanced than ours, but it's quite probable that what we do detect will be technology that is significantly more advanced than ours. Most of the stars in our part of the Milky Way Galaxy are about a billion years older than the sun. So there could be technologies out there that have a large headstart. And for me, the real reason to work on this question is to know whether it's possible for us to have a long future. Right? There are so many challenges on this planet today that would indicate that maybe, maybe our future is not very long because of mistakes that we have made in terms of living on this planet in a sustainable manner. However, if we detect a signal, then we know it is possible to have a long future. And the reason is statistical, right? We are not going to succeed in this project unless on average any technology out there is very long lived. And that's not long in human times, it's long in cosmic time. So a successful detection means that it's possible to have a long future as a technological civilization. And I think that that's really worth going after. I don't expect them to solve our problems, but I do expect if we succeed to be inspired by knowing that somebody else made it through this technological adolescence, and we can too. We simply have to find a way. But we know there's an answer. And that's inspiring for me.

### 科学探索的价值与宇宙文明的伦理考量

Jill Tarter强调，关于宇宙中是否存在其他生命的问题，不应停留在“相信”层面，而应通过系统性的科学探索来寻找答案。她认为，这是人类文明发展过程中一个正确的轨迹。针对**史蒂芬·霍金**（Stephen Hawking: 著名理论物理学家，曾警告人类不要主动联系外星文明）关于地外生命可能带来危险的担忧，Tarter提出了不同的看法。霍金曾将地外文明的到来比作哥伦布发现新大陆对原住民的影响，认为结果可能不妙。但Tarter反思道，如果一个文明能够发展到星际旅行的程度，那它们必然比人类更古老、技术更先进。一个古老的文明，是否已经超越了导致其智能进化的那些“不良行为和侵略性”？她倾向于**史蒂芬·平克**（Steven Pinker: 著名认知心理学家，认为人类文明正变得更温和）的观点，即文化进化将推动文明走向更温和、更友善的结局。

Tarter认为，SETI项目本身就具有改变人类视角的力量。当我们思考宇宙中是否存在其他文明时，我们会开始将自己视为“地球人”，而非仅仅是某个国家或地区的人。这种**宇宙视角**（Cosmic Perspective: 将人类和地球置于宇宙宏大背景下审视的视角）对于解决地球面临的全球性挑战至关重要，因为这些挑战不分国界，需要全球合作才能找到解决方案。哥伦比亚大学天体生物学系主任**卡莱布·沙夫**（Caleb Scharf）也曾指出：“在一个有限的世界里，宇宙视角是必需品，而非奢侈品。”Tarter相信，SETI能够帮助人们拓宽视野，改变观念，从而为人类文明的长期发展奠定基础。

When we used to ask the question, are we alone in the universe? We used to ask the priests and the philosophers or anybody else we thought was smart, we used to ask them what should we believe? But that's the wrong verb, right? There is an answer to that question, but what any of us believe isn't going to change the way the universe is. And so the appropriate thing is to do a scientific exploration to go and try and find out what is. So we've gone from belief to scientific exploration over the past 400 or actually much longer ago in terms of asking the question. And I think that's the right trajectory. This is an appropriate question to be tackled by scientific exploration in a very systematic fashion. Let's approach that by thinking about something that Stephen Hawking once said. He wasn't eager to have extraterrestrials find us because using the analogy to Columbus' discovery of the new world, Stephen said it didn't work out very well for the inhabitants when Columbus discovered the new world. Well, for me, I think there might be another answer, right? First of all, we're talking about them coming here, which means that they have technologies that we haven't yet developed, right? And that means that they're older than we are. And I wonder how you can become an old technological civilization unless you outgrow the bad behavior and the aggressiveness that probably helped you evolve intelligence in the first place? So I'm in the kind of Steven Pinker, kinder and gentler, better nature of ourselves school. And I think that cultural evolution when it begins to take hold will drive a civilization to a kinder and gentler end. Steven takes 900 pages to say that that's actually happening here, right? We are kinder and gentler now than we have ever been. And to the extent that we work on this project, SETI, and we talk to your mother or other people out there and tell them what we're doing, I think it actually has to change their perspective a little bit. They have to stop thinking of themselves as just a Californian, an American. I think SETI holds up a mirror to all the people on the planet and says to them, "Look, you look, in that mirror, you are all the same when compared to something, someone else out there that evolved orbiting a different star." And I think that that sameness, that understanding that we are all earthlings is incredibly important because these challenges that face the planet which are undeniable and which we have to find remedies for, these challenges don't respect national boundaries. And we're going to have to find global solutions to them. And so I think if we can shift our perspective to thinking about ourselves as earthlings, then that has got to be beneficial to finding a way to work together across the planet to come up with solutions to these problems that are very real. So that cosmic perspective is something that I'm eager to talk about, and I think SETI gives me an opportunity to do that. And if you think about the chairman of the astrobiology department at Columbia University, his name is Caleb Scharf, and Caleb has a wonderful way of stating this. He says that on a finite world, that's us, we're on this Earth, on a finite world, a cosmic perspective is a necessity and not a luxury. So to the extent that doing SETI can help us open people's minds, change their perspective, I think it will help us get to a long future.

### 望远镜技术革新与假阳性信号的启示

**艾伦望远镜阵列**（Allen Telescope Array: 由42个6米无线电望远镜组成的阵列）是SETI研究的重要工具，它由42个小型射电望远镜组成，旨在同时进行射电天文学和SETI观测。小型望远镜的优势在于能够同时观测广阔的天区，提高发现瞬变信号的可能性。在选择观测波长时，无线电、光学和红外波段各有优势。由于星际空间充满分子气体和尘埃，光学波段（短波长）容易被吸收和散射，因此我们无法直接观测到银河系中心。然而，红外和无线电波段（长波长）几乎不受尘埃影响，能够穿透更远的距离，这使得它们成为寻找地外信号的理想选择，无论是主动发射的信号还是技术泄漏产生的辐射。SETI的终极目标是实现全天候、全频率的宇宙观测，尽管目前仍面临技术挑战。

**哈特溪无线电天文台**（Hat Creek Radio Observatory）自20世纪60年代以来一直是加州大学伯克利分校的运营基地，见证了多种望远镜的迭代发展。艾伦望远镜阵列的建设，得益于计算能力的飞速提升，使得实时处理和组合大量小型望远镜数据成为可能，开创了射电望远镜建设的新模式。未来的国际项目，如**平方公里阵列**（Square Kilometre Array: 国际大型射电望远镜项目），也采纳了这种由大量小型天线组成的阵列设计。在SETI的探索过程中，误报和假阳性信号是常态。Jill Tarter分享了一次亲身经历：一次夜间飞行中，她和丈夫**杰克·韦尔奇**（Jack Welch: 发现星际介质中水分子的人）看到一个异常明亮的物体，地面雷达却毫无显示，让他们一度以为遭遇了**不明飞行物**（UFO: Unidentified Flying Object）。最终，他们发现那只是月光透过云层破洞的景象。这让她深刻体会到，当人们面对无法解释的现象时，那种困惑和不安，以及寻求科学解释的重要性。

另一次重要的假阳性事件发生在1998年，当时她在**国家射电天文台**（National Radio Astronomy Observatory: 位于西弗吉尼亚州的著名射电天文台）进行观测。由于第二台望远镜因雷击受损，她不得不采用“点头”观测技术（将望远镜在目标星体和非目标方向之间来回切换）来区分信号。她发现了一个具有等频率间隔的“栅栏状”信号，这显然不是自然现象。经过兴奋的初步分析，她误以为这是一个真实的地外信号，并通知了同事。然而，最终发现该信号并非来自目标星体，而是**SOHO航天器**（SOHO spacecraft: 太阳和日球层观测站，绕太阳轨道运行）进入了望远镜的微弱**旁瓣**（Side Lobes: 望远镜主波束以外的次级接收方向）所致。这些经历都强调了SETI工作中验证信号来源、排除干扰的复杂性和严谨性。

So the Allen Telescope Array is a collection of 42 six-meter radio telescopes. We had hoped it would be 350, but there was so much technology that we had to work out in order to build this array as a large number of small dishes the first time ever that we ran out of money. And 42, well, life, the universe, and everything, that's a pretty good place to stop. And the telescopes are built so that they can simultaneously do radio astronomy and SETI observations. Because the telescopes are small, they look at a large field of view on the sky, big patch of the sky at the same time. And so in that large patch of sky, there are likely to be objects, such as molecular clouds or supernova remnants or pulsars or quasars, that radio astronomers would like to study. At the same time, we're collecting data for SETI. And the question of using radio wavelengths versus optical wavelengths versus infrared wavelengths has a lot to do with how those waves pass through the great distances between the stars. Now, we think of space being a vacuum, but indeed, it's filled with some molecular gas and dust. And when you get to be a size, a wavelength is approximately the size of one of those little pieces of dust grain, then that wavelength is heavily absorbed and scattered. That's why at optical wavelengths, these short wavelengths like the size of a grain of dust, we've never seen the center of our galaxy in the optical because that radiation gets absorbed, scattered. But when you get to longer wavelengths into the infrared and then particularly much longer wavelengths in the radio, they essentially don't see the dust at all. So we can see vastly farther through our galaxy in the infrared and in the radio, which is why we think that those wavelengths make sense for someone who is either deliberately trying to create a signal to attract our attention or is using technologies that might very well leak or emit radio or infrared wavelengths. If it's warm, it's gonna glow in the infrared. So we just think that this is a good idea. We'd like to look, obviously, what we'd like to do is look at all the sky all the time at all frequencies. If you could do that, that would be the best way to, oh, and with more than one telescope, that would be the best way to find transient signals that last for only a short period of time. But we can't do that yet. We're beginning to be able to do it in the optical. So yes, our range, how far the signal can go through the interstellar medium, will be more limited. But indeed, the technologies that allow us to actually look at all the sky all the time have developed there rather than in the radio, but all the sky all the time all frequencies, that's the goal, and we'll see where technology takes us. The Hat Creek Radio Observatory where we built the Allen Telescope Array has been run by the University of California at Berkeley since the 1960s. And it just had a series of different types of telescope there. Originally, just a very large 85 foot dish for doing centimeter wavelength observations and then an array of dishes for working at shorter radio wavelengths in the millimeter. And now the Allen Telescope Array is there and it's, you know, it's really kind of nice to have your own telescope so that you can look at the sky 24/7. And indeed, in radio wavelengths you can. The sun is not a bright radio source. So as opposed to our optical counterparts who have to wait until it's dark, we can observe 24 hours a day. Having that facility and having the really bright folks at UC Berkeley and the SETI Institute be able to develop this new technology, which we could not have done much before we did it because it takes so much computing to combine all of the outputs of those small telescopes together in real time, it's been a fantastic opportunity to pioneer a new way of building radio telescopes. And now if you look at the plans for international projects like the Square Kilometre Array, which will be built in South Africa and Western Australia, you can see that those telescopes are all built now as a large number of small dishes. So we actually did something pretty spectacular, proving out this technology. My husband, Jack Welch, who's the gentleman who discovered water in the interstellar medium, we had an airplane that we used to fly from our home in Berkeley, California to Northern California to the Allen Telescope Array up near Mount Lassen. And on one of these flights, we were actually returning to the Bay Area at night and we're flying along and we're actually under positive control, we're talking to the ground and they're following us, and suddenly at two o'clock position, there's this bright light, amazing bright light, and we look at each other and we talk to the ground and we say, "What's at our two o'clock position?" And they say, "There's nothing on the radar," and yet we see this thing. And it was the most confusing feeling. You say, "Oh, a UFO? Really?" Not me. I'm the most skeptical person around, right? How can this be happening?" And it was, oh, it was weird. It was really weird for a good three or four minutes we're staring at this. And then suddenly the clouds, which we hadn't appreciated were there, the clouds broke apart a little more and we got to see the moon that was shining through a hole in the clouds. So I've had a UFO experience, but it became an explained object fairly quickly. And yet I know this unsettling, confusing feeling when you're seeing something, you don't understand it, you can't explain it, and hopefully you'll be lucky the way we were and come up with an explanation because certainly didn't have anything to do with extraterrestrials or little green men or flying saucers. It was really confusing looking at something, understanding that I really, because it was dark and there was no reference frame, I couldn't really tell how big it was, how far away it was, but it sure as heck was there. And then I thought, "Oh, you know, I've been telling people for years to bring me data, to bring me something that I can investigate with respect to their claims of UFOs. Let's get some data." And here I am thinking, well, I can take a picture of that, but that's not gonna do very much good 'cause there's no reference. And besides, the ground control is telling me that there's nothing in the sky on their radar at that position. And so it was just, this can't be happening to me, that was my feeling, and how am I going to explain this to someone and tell them what I experienced? But fortunately, we were able to keep watching and come up with an explanation. The moon shining through a hole in the clouds. Over the years, we've certainly had a number of false positives. Most of them, we can explain very quickly. But there was a time where I was in, I was observing at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia, I think it was in 1998. And our second telescope was in Woodbury, Georgia. And that telescope took a hit by lightning and that fried a disk drive. And it took FedEx a couple of days to get a new disk drive into this very rural area of Georgia. But we were at NRAO, we still had that telescope time, we'd actually rented it. This was back before we could build our own telescope, and we weren't gonna waste it, so we continued observing and instead of having a second telescope to validate the detection, what we did is we pointed our telescope in West Virginia at a star. And then we'd take data and then we'd point it off the star and take data and go back on the star and then off the star and then on the star, this is a standard radio astronomy technique called nodding. And an interesting signal would be one that was there whenever we looked at the star, but was absent when we looked in any other direction. And so early one morning, about five o'clock in the morning, I started tracking this one target. And lo and behold, there was clearly a signal. Now, we do our signal processing in near real time, so that we can in fact do the follow-up necessary to try and distinguish between interference. And in our two-dimensional display of the data with frequency being on the horizontal axis and time being on the vertical axis, what I saw was a series of signals that looked like a picket fence. So multiple signals and the frequency spacing between each signal was the same from one to the next. Well, that's not mother nature. That's pretty clearly an interesting signal. And so I started this nodding, and indeed, every time we moved the telescope, the signal went away and we came back and it was there. And I thought, oh, hmm. I had a very clever thought, although I was very excited and there was a lot of adrenaline going on at this point. Anyway, I thought I'll write a program and I'll ask this program to look at all the data we've collected here at the telescope in the last couple of weeks and see if we've ever seen a signal with that constant frequency spacing coming from some other direction on the sky, not the direction of this star. And I wrote the program and I was so excited. I was pretty sloppy and so I didn't format the output very well. And when I looked at the output, I missed the fact that indeed, we had seen that signal a couple of times before from different directions on the sky. And so now I got really excited and I called the dorm and woke up my colleague John Drayer and he came down and we just stayed on that star all day until it set in the west and we couldn't figure out right away what it was. But by the time the sun had set, the star had set, we knew that the signal wasn't coming from the star because the rate at which the frequencies were changing was appropriate to a source that was rising up to the zenith, not one that was setting in the west. So we knew that it was something else and it took us a while to figure out what it was. And it was, in fact, when you have a telescope, it's like the telescope has peripheral vision. It has what we call side lobes. So I can still see my fingers out here, although I'm looking straight ahead, and a radio telescope is like that. And this particular telescope had a side lobe that was very weak at exactly 90 degrees away from the boresight, the pointing direction. And what was happening was the SOHO spacecraft, which was orbiting the sun, not the Earth, in orbit around the sun, was getting into that side lobe. And every time we moved the telescope in a different direction, it fell out of that side lobe. I was a little disappointed when we quit tracking that star and went off for dinner. But actually, the worst thing was that we had told our colleagues back in Mountain View what we were doing because we had an identical setup there and so they could see the data that was being collected. And we went off to dinner, convinced that no, this wasn't really what we had hoped it would be. And I forgot to call the folks in Mountain View and say, "Sorry, no deal." So they stayed up until two o'clock in the morning at California when that source would rise again because they were sure we were gonna track it, continue tracking it. And so I had some fences to mend when I got home, right, for not being thoughtful enough to let them know that this was not it.

### 卡尔·萨根的遗产与SETI的未来愿景

**卡尔·萨根**（Carl Sagan: 著名天文学家、科普作家和SETI先驱）不仅是一位杰出的天文学家，更是一位卓越的传播者。他与**约瑟夫·什克洛夫斯基**（Joseph Shklovsky: 苏联天文学家，与萨根合著《宇宙中的智慧生命》）合著的《宇宙中的智慧生命》一书，首次以通俗易懂的方式探讨了SETI的科学可能性，极大地激发了学生和科学家们对这项事业的热情。他的电视节目《宇宙》更是将宇宙的壮丽带入千家万户，影响深远。Tarter提到，至今仍有许多年轻女性因萨根的电影《接触》而受到启发，投身科学。她本人也与萨根夫妇有过有趣的互动，电影《接触》中的女主角**艾莉·艾罗威**（Ellie Arroway: 电影《接触》中的女主角，由朱迪·福斯特饰演）的原型，部分灵感就来源于Tarter本人以及萨根接触过的其他女性科学家。与饰演艾莉的**朱迪·福斯特**（Jodie Foster: 著名演员，饰演艾莉·艾罗威）合作，也让她对科学家的人格特质有了更深的思考。

展望未来，Tarter相信，随着物理学和技术的不断进步，将会有更多新颖的手段来寻找地外生命，例如未来可能出现的**zeta射线**（zeta rays: 尚未发明但未来可能用于地外生命搜索的技术）。她期待着新一代大型天文仪器，如30米级地面望远镜和轨道望远镜，能在对其他行星系统成像时，偶然发现地外技术的迹象。例如，像**TRAPPIST-1**（TRAPPIST-1: 拥有七颗地球大小行星的红矮星系统）这样的行星系统，如果未来能对其进行成像，发现其中几颗行星的特征异常相似，这可能就是先进技术进行**地球工程**（Geo-engineering: 对行星环境进行大规模改造以适应特定需求的工程）的证据。在射电领域，**平方公里阵列**（Square Kilometre Array: 国际大型射电望远镜项目）等更大、更灵敏的望远镜将能探测到更微弱的信号；在光学和红外领域，**PANOSETI**和**LaserSETI**等项目正致力于实现全天候、全天空覆盖，以捕捉瞬变信号。Tarter认为，未来SETI将越来越多地以**共生方式**（Commensal Way: 利用非SETI专用天文仪器的观测数据进行SETI探索）进行，利用现有天文仪器收集的数据进行探索。最后，Tarter表达了她对人类向宇宙广播的谨慎态度。她认为，人类文明目前过于年轻，不适合进行广播。广播是一项艰巨且昂贵的任务，需要长期不间断地进行，才能确保当其他新兴文明发展出探测技术时，信号依然存在。她相信，人类应首先发展成为一个古老、稳定的技术文明，然后才能承担起这项永恒的广播任务。

Carl Sagan is not only a good astronomer, but he was a spectacular communicator. And he has the ability to talk to an audience about astronomy, and in particular, his interest in trying to find life beyond Earth. And he was just really compelling. So it's quite appropriate that Lisa Kaltenegger at Cornell University operates something called the Carl Sagan Center for the Study of Life in the Universe. Well, Carl wrote, along with Joseph Shklovsky of the Soviet Union, the first real book about modern SETI. It was called "Intelligent Life in the Universe," I think. And that book really did energize lots of students and scientists and engineers about the possibility of actually conducting a search. And it was the first time that at a popular level, there had been a scientific discussion of this idea. So he is early into this game of thinking about life beyond Earth. And he communicated the excitement of that idea and the fact that indeed, in the 20th century, we actually had some tools to be able to launch a systematic scientific exploration to try and answer this question. So he was very, very influential. And, of course, cosmos talked to the majesty of the universe and really resonated with the public. Carl was an absolutely brilliant communicator, and we miss him. Absolutely. There have been others that have come after him, but no one individual that still has the impact that he had. He would go out and lecture at a university and he would have students come up to him and say, "Cosmos, that's what made me a scientist. That's what inspired me to become a scientist." I get a little of that today because of "Contact," which is now over 20 years old. And particularly young women will come up and say, "Contact, that was my favorite movie, and it inspired me to become a scientist." So it's gratifying. But I sure miss Carl. I was back visiting Cornell for some symposium and Carl said, "Come on up to the house tonight, we're having a cocktail party," and so I did. That was always fun. And when I got there, Ann Druyan, Carl's wife, and Carl took me off to the corner and Ann said, "Carl's writing a science fiction book." And said I, "Yeah, I know. The New York Times told us last weekend what kind of an advance he got for this and we're all jealous as hell, right?" And Annie chuckled and she said, "Well," she said, "I think you might recognize one of the characters, but I think you're gonna like her." And so I said, "Oh, come on, Ann, look, just make sure that Carl doesn't have this female character eat ice cream cones for lunch and then nobody's gonna think it's me, right? Nobody will be confused." That story is because we were over at NASA Ames Research Center and there was no good food, but we could walk at lunchtime over to a Baskin-Robbins and get ice cream for lunch. I got teased a lot about that over the years. But indeed, Carl sent me a pre-publication copy of the book "Contact" and I was going, "Wait, wait! Carl doesn't know this about me. How did he, how, how?" And it turns out that when I was a fresh PhD, I got invited to a meeting in Washington and I walked into a room of 80 female PhDs in all kinds of STEM fields, a life-changing experience for me. I had never walked into a room full of women, very comfortable walking into a room full of men as the only woman, but never a room full of women who were so smart and bright. And we did a little bit of amateur demographics and it turned out that many of those women had their fathers die when they were young, just like me. Many of those women were competitive. And this was pre-Title IX, so there were no women sports teams that you could try out for. The only thing you could try out and compete at was baton twirling or cheerleading. And so an overwhelming number of the women had been drum majorettes or cheerleaders in their high school years. I was a drum majorette. The T-Bird, which is a 54 T-Bird, was America's first real sports car. I was in love with that and the character is as well in "Contact." It turns out that I told Carl about this meeting and we'd written a little report and I sent him the report. And I'm just very prototypical of all those women. And so Carl got many of these anecdotes or traits or characteristics out of that report I sent him. And because I'm so prototypical, I even thought it was me. I'm often introduced as being the woman who was the inspiration for Ellie Arroway played by Jodie Foster in the movie "Contact." And I am in a little way, but really that character is an amalgamation of traits of female scientists that Carl had worked with. And actually, I think the character is Carl himself, right? I think there's a lot of Carl in that character. Anyway, it was fun to be able to work on a set with Jodie Foster. She's very, very brilliant. She's also very kind. And that was a great privilege to work with her. She told us that she was never gonna teach anyone any science, but she was interested in the character of scientists. Were we passionate? Were we supercilious? Do we have big egos? All this kind of thing. And I think she did a grand job with that character. I'm sure that there's something that we haven't quite thought of yet. I'm sure there's physics and technology that we haven't yet understood or invented. So I can imagine that in the future, there will be other technologies that may make sense in terms of trying to find life beyond Earth. Certainly, we can look forward to these new astronomical instruments, very, very large telescopes, ground-based and in orbit. You know, we're now in the era of 10 meter telescopes. We're going into the era of 30 meter telescopes. And we can think and scratch our heads about when these telescopes make images of other planetary systems, what might they see that would be an indication of someone else's technology? Not just astrophysics, but actually what kinds of technology might these large optical and infrared telescopes be able to discover accidentally, serendipitously, right? I like to point out that there's this wonderful star system, called TRAPPIST-1, it's a tiny little red dwarf star, much fainter and smaller than our sun, but it has in orbit around it seven Earth-sized planets. And so one Sunday above the fold in the New York Times, there's this beautiful artist conception of these seven worlds orbiting these tiny red star and an artist had colored them all different. And they should all be different, at least in terms of their temperature because they're at different distances away from their star. But what if we finally get the ability to image those seven worlds and we find out that two or three or four of them are all the same when they shouldn't be. But perhaps some advanced technology has geo-engineered these planets to turn it into the type of real estate that they particularly prefer. So I look forward to that kind of exciting potentially serendipitous detection. And in the radio, we're building bigger telescopes, like the Square Kilometre Array, which will have more sensitivity and be sensitive to fainter transmitters. And then in the optical and the infrared, we're building these telescopes that can look at huge areas on the sky. Something called PANOSETI, something called LaserSETI. And this is their first opportunity to try and go towards that all the sky all the time coverage that will make us sensitive to transient signals. So I'm really excited, and eventually, we may build the Square Kilometre Array in South Africa. We may build the next generation of VLA telescope across the southwest of the United States. And we may orbit large optical telescopes, infrared telescopes that will allow us to do these studies of the atmospheres of distant exoplanets. And so I think that the future is really using astronomical instruments. We're talking about the future where some of these instruments actually might be usable for SETI in a commensal way, not dedicated to SETI, but we can use the data that they collect perhaps to do some SETI explorations. So I'm excited. And, of course, as I said, maybe what we should be looking for are zeta rays, right? Not radio or optical or infrared, but zeta rays. I don't know what a zeta ray is because we haven't invented it yet. But if we do in the future, and if it makes sense, then we should start looking for other technologies using zeta rays. In my opinion, and it's only an opinion, I think we're too young to start broadcasting. Broadcasting is a difficult and more expensive job, and it does no good to broadcast for 15 minutes, for two years, for five years, right? Because your signal is gonna go past your intended recipient in a few minutes, in a few years, in five years, right? If you're going to broadcast, you need to start and not stop. So that when another emerging technology out there begins to explore its universe with tools that are appropriate to detect your signal, the signal will be there for them to find. So I think we need to grow up first. We need to become an old, stable technological civilization. And then we should take on this hard job of broadcasting and do it forever. - [Narrator] Wanna support the channel? Join the Big Think Members Community where you get access to videos early ad-free.
