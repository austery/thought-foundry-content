title: 美国汽车贷款违约率创历史新高：K型经济下的消费者压力分析
---
### K型经济与财富分化

人们常谈论**K型经济**（K-shaped economy: 经济复苏中不同群体表现差异巨大，形似字母K）。这究竟是真实存在的还是一个误解？我坚信它是真实的，但情况更为复杂。去年底我们发现并持续追踪到今年的一点是，虽然我们不是第一个看到**K型经济**的人，但很多人都假设它是由收入水平驱动的。然而，当我们当时查看数据时，我们发现那些收入较高的人群（在我们这里指年收入**15万美元以上**的群体，这并非指对冲基金经理等顶级富豪，而是相对富裕的群体）实际上在当时经历了**最高的年度违约率增长**。所以我们意识到，情况并非如此简单。我们与许多银行进行了深入探讨和合作，试图理解真正的区别因素是什么。最终，**财富**似乎是其中的关键部分。很多人不一定会区分收入和财富，但它们是独立的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

People talk about this k-shaped economy. Is that real or is that a man? I absolutely believe so, but I think that it's a little bit more nuanced. And so, you know, one of the things that we spotted late last year and we're tracking into this year was that we weren't the first to see that it was a k-shaped economy, but a lot of people were making the assumption that the k-shaped economy was being driven by income levels. But when we were looking at the data at the time, we were seeing that those that had were in sort of the higher income level. In our case, that's 150,000 above. So that's not your, you know, people who were running hedge funds and music and, you know, but still it's the relatively better to do, cohort. They were actually seeing the highest year over year increases in delinquency rates at the time. So we knew that okay, hold on a second. It isn't as simple as this. So, you know, we spend a lot of time and thought a lot of banks and we kind of collaborated with them to try to understand what's what's really then the differentiator. And then what seemed to be a really a part of this is wealth. So, you know, a lot of people don't necessarily differentiate income and wealth, but they are separate. Yeah.

</details>

当审视高收入群体时，为了判断哪些人表现良好，哪些人表现不佳，**房屋所有权**是最大的区别因素，因为它提供了更大的缓冲，是他们可以依赖的东西。此外，股票所有权和小企业所有权等其他方面也发挥作用。但**房屋所有权**影响更大、更广，因为在美国经济中，拥有房产的人口总体上比拥有股票投资组合的人更多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And so, you know, when you're looking then at a high income cohort at a time to try to see like, okay, well which ones are doing well. Which ones weren't. Homeownership was the biggest differentiator because they had a bigger cushion something they can rely on, rely on. And then obviously other indicator other aspects as well like stock ownership and and small business ownership etc.. But homeownership is is the one that has the more and the bigger effect because there's more people in the US economy on a whole. And then let's say has a stock portfolio.

### 消费者情绪与经济现状

欢迎收听**《Odd Lots》播客**的又一期节目。我是**乔·魏森塔尔**（Joe Weisenthal），我是**特蕾西·阿洛韦**（Tracy Alloway）。我感觉自己现在对消费者状况完全没有把握。真的，一方面是**K型经济**，劳动力市场放缓，另一方面却是多年来最低的裁员率。你出门一看，一切都欣欣向荣。我就是摸不着头脑。我觉得情绪很糟糕，但消费者情绪糟糕了好几年，人们却一直在购物。我对此毫无概念。最近消费者情绪实际上好于预期，这确实令人惊讶。但我想问，你难道没有出去买圣诞礼物吗？太疯狂了，对吧？很多人都在买东西。但这恰恰说明了**K型经济**的观点：如果有一群富裕的人购买更多，这足以抵消低收入人群以更低价格购买更少商品的影响。所以，这真的很难判断。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Hello and welcome to another episode of the Odd Lots podcast. I'm Joe Weisenthal and I'm Tracy Alloway. I feel like I just do not have any feel right now, unlike the state of the consumer. Really. I mean, your k-shaped economy, labor market slowing down. Then there's like lowest layoffs in years. You go outside, everything looks booming. Like I just have no feel right. I think sentiment is terrible, but consumer sentiment is terrible for years and people keep shopping. I have no sense of it. Right? Well, consumer sentiment actually came in higher than expected most recently. True. Big surprise. But I was going to say are you not out shopping for Christmas presents? It's insane. Right? Yeah. There's a lot of people buying a lot of stuff, buying a lot of stuff. But I think this gets to the K-shaped economy point, which is if you have a cohort of wealthy people who are buying more, it more than offsets the lower income people who are buying less at lower prices. So it's really hard to tell. It's really hard to tell.

</details>

有一点确实感觉不同。如果你看家庭资产负债表的总体衡量标准，这与**全球金融危机**（Global Financial Crisis: 2008年爆发的全球性金融危机）之前的情况大相径庭。普遍的观点是，美国消费者或美国家庭拥有非常大的缓冲。那里积累了大量的**房屋净值**（Home Equity: 房屋当前市场价值减去未偿抵押贷款余额的差额）。这不是薄薄一层。显然，任何有钱或有投资账户的人都表现出色。我们录制节目的前一天，**标普500指数**（S&P 500 Index: 由标准普尔公司编制的500家美国大型上市公司股票指数）创下了历史新高。所以，如果你有任何形式的**房屋净值**积累或投资，你都做得很好。另一方面，当然，人们多年来一直受到通货膨胀的困扰。我们知道招聘已经放缓，我们也看到汽车违约率飙升的头条新闻。但我多年来一直在看到这些新闻，我完全不知道它们意味着什么，或者它们与过去相比有多大的可比性。我就是不知道，我非常困惑。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

One thing that, definitely feels different. You know, if you look at aggregate measures of household balance sheets, like this is something that is very different than sort of like pre grade financial crisis. The, the the general view is that the American consumer or the American household has a very big cushion. There is a lot of home equity built up there. It is not a thin layer. Obviously anyone with money and any sort of, you know, investment account has done phenomenally well. We're recording this December 12th yesterday, I think the S&P 500 hit yet a new all time high. So if you have any sort of home equity buildup, if you have any sort of investment, you are doing very well. On the other hand, of course, people are stretched from years of inflation. We know that hiring has, slowed down. We know that, you know, we see these headlines, delinquencies for cars have like shot up. But I've been seeing these headlines for years. I don't totally know what they mean or how apples to apples they are with the past. I just don't know. I just I'm very confused. Yeah.

</details>

从金融角度来看，一个非常有趣的点是，如果审视那些基于消费贷款发行的债券，目前表现最差的债券来自**2020年至2022年**期间。这很有意思，因为违约率等衡量标准，一方面是某个时间点的快照，反映了当时的健康状况；但另一方面，它也固有地反映了过去的情况，例如当时的贷款标准。那是一个低利率时期，华尔街的银行都在积极放贷，几乎是“见人就给钱”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

You know what's really interesting to me, just from a financial perspective? Yeah. If you look at some of the bonds that were actually built on consumer loans, the weakest ones are now from the like 2020 to 2022 period. Oh, was that so? See, this is another interesting element of measures like delinquencies and why I sort of wonder like how comparable they are. Because okay, partly a delinquency measure is a snapshot of a moment in time. Right? A snapshot of health. But it also inherently reflects something in the past because it reflects, you know, what were lending standards at the time. Right. Exactly. So, you know, and that was a period of low interest rates. Everything was turning on Wall Street banks. Yeah. Give money to anyone.

</details>

### 嘉宾介绍与VantageScore使命

因此，我们需要更清晰地了解当前的情况：消费者承受着多大的压力？这些违约率在多大程度上反映了贷款机构在利率极低的繁荣时期过度放贷的行为？尤其是在购物季期间，我们必须弄清楚这些问题。我们非常高兴能邀请到一位完美的嘉宾——**里卡德·班德博**（Rikard Bandebo），他是**VantageScore**（一家美国信用评分公司）的执行副总裁、首席战略官兼首席经济学家。里卡德，非常感谢您来到播客。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Anyway, we need to get a better picture of exactly what's going on. How stressed is the consumer? How much do these delinquencies just reflect the profligacy of lenders during the boom times when rates were nothing, etc.? And, yes, we need to figure this out. Especially we're in the middle of shopping season and all that stuff. So I'm very excited to say we really do have the perfect guest. We're going to be speaking with Rikard Bandebo He is the executive vice president, chief strategy officer, chief economist at VantageScore, a credit scoring company. Rikard, thank you so much for coming on the podcast.

</details>

**VantageScore**是美国最大的信用评分公司，约在20年前由三大信用局——**环联**（TransUnion）、**益百利**（Experian）和**艾可菲**（Equifax）共同创立。我们的创立宗旨非常明确：推动信用评分领域的更大竞争。在此之前，这个领域几乎没有太多选择。我们还致力于推动更多创新，创建最具预测性的评分模型，这是当时银行提出的重要需求。同时，我们也希望扩大信贷产品的覆盖范围，让数百万真正有信誉的人能够获得信贷产品。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Thank you for having me. It's an honor. What is VantageScore, a U.S. credit scoring company. What do you do there? So we're the largest credit scoring company in the United States. And we were founded almost 20 years ago by the three credit bureaus TransUnion, Equifax and Experian. And we sort of created, with a very specific mission in mind to to drive greater competition and credit scoring. Prior to us, that really wasn't a lot of choice in this space. We've also there to create sort of drive more innovation and create the most predictive scores. Which was a big ask from the banks at the time, and also to be able to expand access to millions to enable everyone who really is creditworthy to be able to get access to credit products.

</details>

### 信用评分的应用与数据来源

您刚才提到了银行。能否详细说明一下你们的客户群？当然，当人们想到信用评分时，首先想到的主要用途是贷款。当你申请贷款时，贷款机构会评估你是否能按时还款，通常会查看你的信用评分。但信用评分也用于许多其他阶段。例如，许多申请新公寓租赁的人可能也会被要求提供信用评分。在纽约，当你尝试获得水电煤气等公用事业服务时，肯定会被要求提供。是的，确实如此。水电费、电话费，以及任何涉及长期支付承诺的服务，现在通常都会要求你提供信用评分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

You mentioned the banks. Just then. Can you expound a little bit more on your customer base? Yeah. So, you know, we used obviously the primary use case that most people think about when it comes to credit scores, is for lending, right? When you know, you're applying for a loan and they want to evaluate whether or not you're going to be able to perform on that loan, they'll often pull your credit score as part of that process, but it's used in many other stages as well. So, for instance, many people who are applying to rent in a new apartment building may also get asked for it. When you are trying to get a utility. Definitely in New York, you get asked for it. Yes, you certainly do. And utility bills, telephones, anything that involves a long term commitment on payments generally. Now, you'll often get asked to provide your credit score.

</details>

所以，我刚才解释了你们是如何成立的，是由谁成立的？20年前，我们是由**益百利**、**艾可菲**和**环联**这三家全国性信用报告机构合资成立的。我不明白这些我们都听说过、提供信用评分的大公司和你们之间有什么区别？我的意思是，你们和他们有什么不同？他们负责收集贷款机构和其他方面关于你信用表现记录的所有数据，他们被称为信用局。他们收集这些数据并受到严格监管。但大多数贷款机构无法仅凭这些数据就做出判断，他们需要一些指导来解读这些数据意味着什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So I just explained for the way you were, you were started by whom? 20 years ago, we were a joint venture by Experian, Equifax and TransUnion, the three national credit reporting agencies. I don't understand what's the difference between these major companies that we've all heard of that provide a credit score, etc. that they such founded you like? I mean, what do you do differently than them? Well, so what they do is they're the ones who, who, collect all this data from lenders and others on your credit performance record. They call credit bureaus. They collect that they're highly regulated. But then most lenders can't just make sense of all of that data on its own. They need some guidance to help to translate that into a what does that mean? Right? Okay.

</details>

这就是我们的评分算法发挥作用的地方。我们的评分算法能够整合关于你的数百种不同因素，然后判断这对于你的**还款倾向**（Propensity to Pay: 借款人按时偿还债务的可能性）意味着什么。您还提到了**预测性分析**（Predictive Analysis: 利用数据、统计算法和机器学习技术识别未来结果可能性的分析方法）。那具体是什么，它基于什么？当信用评分被创建时，目标是评估一个人在未来24个月内违约的可能性。所以当你看到那个分数时，它实际上是概率的转化，用来评估风险。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And so that's where our scoring algorithm comes into effect. Right. And so the scoring algorithm helps to take in all these hundreds of different factors about you. Yeah. To try to then determine what does that mean about your propensity to pay okay. You mentioned predictive analysis as well. What exactly is that and what's that based on. Well so when credit scores are created right. The aim the goal is to try to evaluate what is the likelihood of somebody going to, default on a payment over the next 24 months. So when you see that score, the score is actually a translation of a probability. Yeah, I don't odds right. To evaluate what is that risk.

</details>

### FICO评分系统的历史与VantageScore的诞生

那么，美国的**FICO评分**（FICO Score: 美国最广泛使用的个人信用评分模型）系统是如何形成的呢？它有一段有趣的历史。早年间，**费尔·艾萨克**（Fair Isaac）公司创建了第一个广为人知的信用评分。他们是第一个意识到，在过去，贷款系统并不总是最公平的。贷款机构可能会打电话给你的前雇主、房东，或者只是四处打听。如果他们对你一无所知，贷款过程中就会涉及很多主观判断，甚至存在种族歧视。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And how did we end up with the system of Fico scores in the US because it has like an interesting history? Well, you know, back in the day, fair Isaac, you know, they created the first sort of known credit score. They were the first ones to realize that, you know, there was a free and fair Isaac. Is that focusing? Yes. Oh, okay. Yes. Keep going. Let's go back a bit. Right. So in the old days, you know, lending was not necessarily the most fair system that there was, right. You know, they may want to call up your previous employer, they may call your landlord, they may just ask around. And if they don't know anything about you, you know, there was a lot of judgment involved in lending a lot of racial discrimination as well. That certainly was built into that system. Right.

</details>

后来，**《公平信用报告法》**（Fair Credit Reporting Act: 旨在促进信用报告的准确性、公平性和隐私性的美国联邦法律）出台，规定不能再那样做。你需要一个更公平、更具量化能力来评估个人风险的系统。这催生了将所有量化信息整合起来，以便贷款机构易于使用的需求。当时，**FICO**是第一家创建这种系统的公司，并且做得非常成功。但后来，市场需要竞争和创新。大约20年前，人们普遍感到沮丧，因为市场上只有一种评分系统，而且它无法覆盖大约**20%的美国人口**（至今仍是如此）。许多贷款机构也感到不满，认为如果20%的人口无法评分，那就是个问题，我们需要不同的东西。于是，信用局采取了不同寻常的举动，联合起来创建了一个替代方案，这就是**VantageScore**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And so, then there was a law career, the Fair Credit Reporting Act. They said, like, you can't do that. You need a, you know, a better system that is fair. And that is a better quantitative ability to assess people's risk. Right. And that created than this, need to be able to consolidate all this quantitative information in a way that lenders could easily use it. So, you know, a Fico was the first fair Isaac at the time was the first to create that. And they did very well doing so. But, you know, then there was a need for, competition, innovation and there was a lot of frustration around the time of 20 years ago that there was only one game in town, and it and it didn't score about 20% of the US population. It still doesn't. And so and then a lot of lenders were felt frustrated. Like, like if it doesn't work for 20% of the population, there's a problem. We need something different. And so then and the bureaus took the unusual step of actually coming together to create an alternative. And that became Vantagescore interest.

</details>

### 消费者如何获取信用评分

作为消费者，我可以“货比三家”选择信用评分吗？首先，使用方式有所不同。贷款机构通常会选择他们用于贷款审批的信用评分。而且，通常他们会使用比简单信用评分更多的因素，特别是那些更复杂的机构。然而，当你试图了解自己的信用状况时，有很多不同的地方可以查询。你可以去信用局，也可以去像**Credit Karma**这样的服务平台。市面上有很多不同的服务。但我不能强迫贷款机构查看特定的评分，比如“看我这个分数，它很好”。恐怕不行，这不是它的运作方式。贷款机构会根据他们的产品来决定哪种评分最合适。市面上有很多不同的评分模型，有些是专门为特定产品（如汽车贷款）设计的，有些则是通用的，可用于任何类型的产品。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Can I, as a consumer, go, credit score shopping. So the, first of all, there's different ways to, to use it, right? So a lender will typically choose the credit score that they're going to use for being able to, underwrite alone with you. And often, you know, they'll use many more factors than just a simple credit score, right? Particularly the more sophisticated ones. However, when you're trying to understand what your situation is, you had lots of different places you can go. You can either go to the credit bureaus, you can go to the likes of Credit Karma. There are many different services out there, but I can't force the lender to look at a specific don't look at yeah, look at this one over here. It's great. You get a second opinion. No, I'm afraid not. That's not how it works. It's really, you know, the lenders try to determine what is the most appropriate score for their product and different. And there are many, many different schools out there that schools that are in some cases built specifically for types of products, like auto loans and the other schools that are schools that are generic, that can be used for any type of product.

</details>

### VantageScore的创新与覆盖范围

你们是如何收集更多数据的？您提到信用局未能覆盖很大一部分人口。除了他们之外，你们还做了哪些额外的工作来扩大覆盖范围，找到那些之前被遗漏的、潜在有信誉的借款人？信用局收集的数据质量和类型随着时间推移已经显著改善。当我们开始创建我们的算法时，例如目前用于抵押贷款的**VantageScore 4.0**版本，我们今年还将发布**5.0版本**。我们每次都会重写整个算法，以便每次都能根据当前可用数据和我们对消费者行为的理解，得出最准确的评估方式，因为消费者的行为会随着时间而变化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

What do you do? See, you collect more data. And you mentioned that there is this wide swath of the population that doesn't that that wasn't being captured by the credit bureaus. What do you do additionally, on top of them to expand the pool, find potentially creditworthy borrowers that the, that the, that they had been missing before. So, you know, the the the thing is that, the quality and the types of data that's been collected by the credit bureaus has improved significantly over time. Okay. And so when we started creating our algorithms were, you know, the current version that's now being adopted for mortgages, the version four, we're releasing version five this year. We obviously we actually go and rewrite the whole thing each time so that each time we can come up with the most accurate way based on the current data available and our current ability to understand how consumers are behaving, because that behavior changes over time.

</details>

其他公司可能很早以前就建立了一个模型，不愿透露其运作方式，也就是所谓的“秘方”。作为首席风险官，当出现新模型时，你希望它与旧模型非常相似，这样才能接受它；或者你需要对它的运作方式有高度透明的了解，才能对新模型感到放心。我认为这是一种巨大的战略分歧。我们每次都从头开始重新构建一切，但同时提供大量的透明度和工具，以便贷款机构能够非常清楚地了解它将如何运作以及在不同情况下的表现。他们可以进行测试。而其他模型仍然存在许多自最初模型以来就存在的局限性。正是由于这些局限性，我们能够为更多人评分，这是很大的不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

You know, other companies, what they've done is they built a model long time ago. They don't like to necessarily revealed everybody how it works. The secret sauce. Right. So when you're seeing that as a chief risk officer, and there's a new model coming along, either you want to understand that it's going to be very similar to the previous one to be okay with it, or you need to get a lot of transparency in how it works so you can get comfort in this new model. So I think there's the big divergence in strategy. We go back to boots and redo everything from scratch each time, but in the same time provide an awful lot of transparency and a lot of tools so that lenders can get a really good understanding of exactly how this is going to work and how it's going to behave in different situations. And they can test it out right. Whereas the other one is still working with many limitations that have been in place since the very first models. And because of those limitations, that's a big difference in why, we score a lot more people.

</details>

我给您举一个非常具体的例子。其他模型的一个限制是，如果你在过去六个月内没有任何信用活动，你就不会获得评分。你可以想象一下，一个军人被部署到海外或其他情况。但好消息是，大约15年前，信用局开始收集和存储数据，所以我们可以使用**时间序列数据**（Time Series Data: 按时间顺序排列的数据点集合），因为谁会想到时间序列数据在预测中会很有用呢？这听起来是个完全奇怪的想法，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So I give you a very concrete example. So for instance, one of the limitations that the others have is that if you haven't had any credit activity for the past six months, you're not going to get a score. So you could just imagine somebody that is, to watch the military been deployed overseas or anything else. Right. But the good thing is, you know, starting about, you know, 15 years ago, the bureau started collecting and storing data so we could use time series data, because who'd have thought that time series data could be useful in prediction, right. Completely strange idea. Right.

</details>

**VantageScore**很早就开始使用**趋势数据**（Trended Data: 记录信用账户随时间变化的详细数据）和**时间序列数据**。有了这些数据，我们显然可以看到大约24个月的情况。所以，如果历史记录中有六个月的空白，这很重要，但我们仍然能够看到之前发生了什么。这解决了数千万人无法获得评分的问题。还有其他限制，比如信用新手，如果他们没有完整的六个月历史记录，也不会获得评分；如果他们只有交易记录，也不会获得评分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So with with Vantagescore before we started and using trended data time series data. And with that obviously we can see about 24 months. So yes, if there's a gap in six months of history, it's important. But we're still able to see what happened before then. Right. And that gets rid of, you know, tens of millions of people when you have that constraint. There are other constraints in there too. So people that are new to credit. So if they haven't had a full six months of history, again, they won't get scored. And then if they only trade lines, they won't get scored. Right.

</details>

我们通过两种不同的方式解决了这些限制：一是使用**时间序列数据**，二是使用其他数据点。我们是第一家使用公用事业支付和租金数据进行评分的公司。谁会想到你支付租金的能力竟然也能用于评估你的风险呢？所以，通过纳入这些新的不同类型的数据，并意识到有了**时间序列数据**，这些限制可以改变。而且，数学也在不断发展。我们还意识到，如果你能非常聪明地使用一些新方法，比如一些**人工智能**（Artificial Intelligence: 模拟人类智能的计算机系统）方法，例如**聚类分析**（Clustering: 将数据集中的对象分组，使同一组内的对象比不同组的对象更相似），就能真正理解“这是一群人，他们以某种方式行事”。通过更好地做到这一点，我们就能找出衡量这群人与那群人的最佳方式。做得好就能建立更具预测性的评分模型。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And so what we've been able to do is to deal with those constraints in a different way by a using time series data, b using some other data points. So we were the first to use M utility payments and rent. I mean, who'd have thought that your ability to pay your rent could somehow, again, be useful in trying to assess your your risk? Right. And so, you know, including those new different types of data, realizing that these constraints can be changed now that you have time series data, but then also guess what? You know, math has evolved as well. Okay. And so, you know, what we realized too was that you if you can be really smart and use some new methods like, you know, some AI methods, for instance, like clustering to really understand, well, look, here's a group of people and they behave in a certain way. And by doing that in a better way, we can then figure out what is the best way to measure this group of people here versus this group of people here. And doing that well enables you to build much more predictive scores.

</details>

一个并非很多人都意识到的重要答案是，计算每个人的分数并非只有一个公式。人们会根据他们的信用档案和历史记录被划分为不同的细分群体，然后每个细分群体都会根据其特点进行评分。这再次提高了准确评分的能力，并能为更多人评分。以我们为例，我们能够额外为**3300万人**评分，这是一个相当可观的数字。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And so that's an important the answer to that. Not a lot of people always realize is that it's not one formula that's calculating everybody's score. You know, people will get depending on what their credit file looks like and the history looks like, they'll get divided into, you know, different segments, and then each segment is scored according to that. And that again increases the ability to score people accurately and score more people like in our case, it's 33 million more people that we're able to score. So it's quite substantial.

</details>

### 信用评分的相对性与外部经济因素

模型如何处理消费者模式的重大中断？因为我们近年来确实看到了一些重大的中断。例如，疫情过后，我们经历了异常紧张的劳动力市场，低收入人群的工资大幅增长，以及许多前所未有的消费行为。模型是如何将这种趋势的巨大转变纳入考量的？我认为这是一个非常重要但很多人不容易理解的问题。请给我一点时间，我来解释一下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

How did the models deal with, breaks in previous consumer patterns? Because we have seen, some major ones in recent years. So after the pandemic, we had phenomenal, a phenomenally tight labor market. And we saw a lot of wage growth for lower income, a lot of spending that was sort of unprecedented in many ways. How do models actually incorporate that sort of big shift in the trend? So I think that's something really important to try to understand. And it's and it's not easily understood by many. So give me a second here. I'll try to break this down. This is no we have when people say, give me a second, I have to break this down. Please break it down. You can have a minute. Have a minute. Honestly, that's kind of what I enjoy most about listening to your, podcast. Yeah.

</details>

首先要理解的是，信用评分不是衡量风险的绝对指标，而是**相对指标**。让我来详细解释一下。这意味着，如果一个人在一个月内获得720分，而另一个人三年后获得720分，他们的风险是不同的。我们评估一个人时，这种差异是故意为之的。根据**《公平信用报告法》**的规定，我们只能关注与你个人相关的信息，但同时经济中也存在影响整体人口风险的外部因素。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And so, like, the first thing to understand is that this credit score is not an absolute measure of risk. It's a relative measure of risk. And let me break that down for you. Right. So what it means is that, you know, a score, if somebody did score 720 in 1 month and then somebody else has score 723 years later, the risk will be different. And the reason for that is very deliberate when we are evaluating a person. Right. Because of the laws of the fair Credit Reporting Act. Right. We're allowed to look at the things that are about you, but there are things that are going out on at the same time in the economy that impact risk of the population as a whole. Right?

</details>

这就是为什么在查看信用评分时，了解该评分是在何时获得的非常重要。因为2017年的720分与2022年的720分具有非常不同的特征。但要记住的是，这是一个出色的**相对风险衡量标准**。所以在任何一个给定时间点，一个720分的人的表现会比630分的人好得多，而840分的人又会比这两者都好得多。这一点始终是成立的。因此，在做出贷款决策时，将其纳入考量仍然非常重要。

<summary>Original English</summary>

So that's why it's so important when you're looking at things like credit scores to understand when was that score pulled? Right. Because the score, 720 in 2017 had a very different characteristic, of a score of 720 in 2022. Okay. Now, but the thing to bear in mind is this is an excellent relative measure of risk. So at any one given point in time, you know, somebody with a 720 is going to be much better performing than somebody at 630. And the same time somebody at 840 is going to be much better than both of them. Okay. And that holds consistently true. And so that's why it's very important and still obviously very important to include when you're making lending decisions.

但贷款机构必须深思熟虑。他们在决定要批准多少人贷款以及如何考虑风险时，也需要开始考虑这些外部因素，以便他们能够设定承保标准，以满足他们愿意承担的风险水平。我以前从未想过这一点，但这确实很有道理。所以，即使我拥有出色的信用记录，有稳定的工作，按时支付所有租金，但如果经济正在衰退，我仍然可能是一个有风险的借款人，因为我随时可能失业。因此，这种相对性的概念是必要的，因为影响每个人的潜在条件是我们无法控制的，但对于贷款机构来说仍然很重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

But you know, lenders have to be thoughtful, right? They have to as they're making decisions about, you know, how many people they want to be to underwrite and how to think about risk. They need to also start thinking about these external factors as well, so that they can then, you know, set their underwriting criteria to meet the kind of level of risk that they're willing to take on this mixture. I had never thought about this, but of course, that makes so much sense. So it's like I could have an excellent credit history. I could have ex employment pay all my rent, but for example, if the economy is going down the tubes, I may still yet be a risky credit because I may lose my job at some point. And so this idea that it kind of has to be relative because the underlying conditions that affect everyone are they're outside of our control, but they are still important from the perspective of the lender.

</details>

没错。同时，如果你申请信用卡被拒，你不能被告知原因是失业率达到了5%。法律规定非常具体，你未能获得最高评分的原因必须得到解释，并且必须基于与你个人相关的属性和数据。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Exactly. And at the same time, you know, if you get declined for credit card, you can't be told that the reason you're getting declined is because unemployment has hit 5%. Okay, right. It's that doesn't work that the laws are very specific. The reasons for why you're not getting the top score have to be explained, and they have to be based on, on, attributes and data, obviously, that are specific to you.

</details>

### 影响信用评分的外部因素权重

在信用评分方面，最重要的外部因素是什么？我听说过关于劳动力市场、失业率、工资收入以及实际可支配收入的论点。你们如何权衡这些不同的因素？我认为，对于贷款机构来说，这真的取决于你向哪种类型的消费者放贷。特别是现在，我们看到消费者之间存在巨大的差异，有些人表现良好，有些人则不然。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

What's the most important external factor when it comes to credit scoring? Because I've heard arguments for obviously the labor market, the unemployment rate, but also wage income and therefore real disposable income. How do you weight those different factors? I mean, I think if you're a lender, it's going to really depend upon what types of consumers you're lending to. Right. And particularly now we're seeing such divergence across consumers in terms of who's doing well and who isn't.

</details>

例如，如果你是一个专注于**次优级**（Near Prime: 信用评分略低于优质借款人，但高于次级借款人的群体）或**次级**（Subprime: 信用记录较差，违约风险较高的借款人）以下人群的贷款机构，并且你专注于汽车贷款，又在德克萨斯州或某些特定地区，那么了解影响这些人的经济状况就非常重要。比如，这些人可能在某些特定行业工作，这些行业的就业状况如何？或者他们是**零工经济**（Gig Economy: 临时合同或自由职业者工作盛行的市场）中的人群？所以情况非常复杂，并非只有单一因素，而是取决于具体情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And so, for instance, if you are a lender focused on people that are kind of below prime, let's say that not completely subprime, but that near prime group and, and you're, you know, you're focusing on auto loans and you know, you're in regions like Texas or in certain areas, then obviously, the understanding the economic conditions that are affecting those people, like, you know, a lot of those people would be working in certain types of industries. What is employment like in those types of industries? Right. Or is it people that are in the gig economy? Right. And so, it is quite nuanced. It's not necessarily one thing and it's going to depend.

</details>

另一方面，如果你发放的是**黑卡**（Black Card: 通常指高端信用卡，面向极高净值客户），你的客户群体非常富裕，那么风险就不是主要考虑因素，因为他们的违约风险可能只有万分之一。所以他们只是想确保绝对没有风险。因此，在高度周期性行业工作的人，比如德克萨斯州的卡车司机，如果他们申请汽车贷款，可能会被视为风险较高，或者他们的劳动力市场状况会对其影响更大。而如果你申请的是**美国运通黑卡**（Black Amex Card: 美国运通发行的顶级信用卡，通常需要邀请才能获得），那么可能更多地取决于实际可支配收入。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Whereas on the other extreme, you know, if you're handing out black cards and your audience is incredibly affluent, then again, you know, it's it's less about the risk because at that point, your risk of default is probably 1 in 10,000, right. So they're they're just trying to make, you know, sure that it is absolutely risk free. All right. So someone in a highly cyclical industry, like, I don't know, truck drivers in Texas or something that we're taking out, auto loans would probably be seen as riskier or the labor market would depend more for them. Whereas if you're taking out, you know, a black Amex card or something like that, probably real disposable income. Yeah. Okay.

</details>

### K型经济的财富驱动因素

您提到了不同的细分市场。人们谈论的**K型经济**是真实的还是一个流行语？我绝对相信它是真实的，但情况更为复杂。去年底我们发现并持续追踪到今年的一点是，我们不是第一个看到**K型经济**的人，但很多人都假设它是由收入水平驱动的。然而，当我们当时查看数据时，我们发现那些收入较高的人群（在我们这里指年收入**15万美元以上**的群体，这并非指对冲基金经理等顶级富豪，但仍是相对富裕的群体）实际上在当时经历了**最高的年度违约率增长**。所以我们意识到，情况并非如此简单。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So you mentioned different segmentation. Is the, people talking about this k-shaped economy, is that real or is that a meme? I absolutely believe so. But I think that it's a little bit more nuanced. And so, you know, one of the things that we spotted late last year and we're tracking into this year was that we weren't the first to see that it was a k-shaped economy, but a lot of people were making the assumption that the k-shaped economy was being driven by income levels. But when we were looking at the data at the time, we were seeing that those that had were in sort of the higher income level. In our case, that's 150,000 above. So that's not your, you know, people who are running hedge funds and etc. and, you know, but still it's, it's the relatively better to do cohort. They were actually seeing the highest year over year increases in delinquency rates at the time. So we knew that okay, hold on a second. It isn't as simple as this.

</details>

我们花了很多时间与许多银行合作，试图理解真正的区别因素是什么。最终，**财富**似乎是其中的关键部分。很多人不一定会区分收入和财富，但它们是独立的。当审视高收入群体时，为了判断哪些人表现良好，哪些人表现不佳，**房屋所有权**是最大的区别因素，因为它提供了更大的缓冲，是他们可以依赖的东西。此外，股票所有权和小企业所有权等其他方面也发挥作用。但**房屋所有权**影响更大、更广，因为在美国经济中，拥有房产的人口总体上比拥有股票投资组合的人更多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So, you know, we spend a lot of time and sort of a lot of banks and we kind of collaborated with them to try to understand what's what's really then the differentiator. And then what seemed to be really a part of this is wealth. So, you know, a lot of people don't necessarily differentiate income and wealth, but they are separate. Yeah. And so, you know, when you're looking then at a high income cohort at a time to try to see like, okay, well which ones are doing well and which ones weren't homeownership was the biggest differentiator because they had a bigger cushion, something they can rely on, rely on. And then obviously other indicator, other aspects as well, like stock ownership and and small business ownership etc.. But homeownership is is the one that has the more and the bigger effect because there's more people in the US economy on a whole. And then let's say has a stock portfolio.

</details>

### 抵押贷款利率与住房市场前景

我们来多谈谈抵押贷款利率，这在讨论**K型经济**时非常关键。任何在**2020年**之前购买房屋的人，可能都是非常幸运的，因为他们锁定了较低的抵押贷款利率。我认为，即使在降息之后，抵押贷款利率仍然在6%左右，而疫情后一度降至3%，甚至有人达到了2.5%，这简直是疯狂。所以，如果你那时买了房子，你实际上就拥有了您所说的巨大缓冲，这与现在或过去几年买房的人形成了对比。从某种程度上说，我看到了住房市场的一线希望。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

I talk more about mortgage rates because this feels pretty key when you're talking about the k-shaped economy, which is if anyone, anyone who bought their house before 2020, is probably a very lucky person and, has locked in a low mortgage rate, I think mortgage rates are still even after the rate cut, we're at like 6% or something versus I think at one point they got down to like 3% right after the for people like 2.5%. Yeah. Crazy. Yeah. And so if you bought a house then you actually have this like massive cushion, as you put it, versus someone who's buying a house now or in the past couple of years in a way, I see there's a bit of a silver lining when it comes to housing, right?

</details>

我们看到本周利率有所下降。希望明年它们能继续下降。当然，即使在**美联储**（Federal Reserve: 美国中央银行系统）内部，对于降息速度也有很多争论。显然，还有许多其他因素会影响这一点。但我们看到一线希望有两个原因。首先，随着利率下降，对于房主来说，抵押贷款是他们最大的月供。目前，鉴于现有利率，许多人没有太多理由进行**再融资**（Refinancing: 用新的贷款替换现有贷款，通常是为了获得更低的利率或更好的条款）。但如果利率再下降一点，对于大量拥有较高利率的房主来说，进行转换将更有意义。所以我们预计，一旦利率达到某个水平，将会出现一波**再融资热潮**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

We we have seen rates come down this week. Hopefully they will continue to come down next year. Yeah, there's a lot of debate, obviously even within the Federal Reserve. Mr.. Exactly. The the speed at which that's going to be accomplished. And obviously there are many other factors that can impact that. But I the reason we see a silver lining is to for two reasons. Okay. As interest rates comes down, obviously for people to own homes, that's their biggest monthly payment. Right now there isn't much, point for many to refinance given what the interest rates are. But if it comes down a bit more, it'll be much more. It'll make much more sense for a large tranche of homeowners that have higher interest rates to be able to to make that switch. So we'd expect a bit of a refinancing boom as it hits a certain level.

</details>

### 抵押贷款信用评分规则的重大变革

关于房屋所有权领域正在发生的事情，另一个真正令人兴奋的是，今年**联邦住房金融局**（Federal Housing Finance Agency, FHFA: 负责监管房利美、房地美和联邦住房贷款银行的美国政府机构）改变了抵押贷款中可以使用哪些信用评分的规则。历史上，他们一直使用**FICO经典评分**（FICO Classic Score: FICO公司较早期的信用评分模型）的一个非常旧的版本，该版本可追溯到90年代，用于抵押贷款申请。这并非刻意为之，只是它被写入了规则，然后作为一项建议，但后来实际上成为了该领域的**事实垄断**（De Facto Monopoly: 尽管没有法律规定，但因市场主导地位而形成的垄断）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

But the other thing that's really exciting about what's happening in the homeownership space is that in the, this year, the FAA changed the rules about, what can be used, what credit scores can be used in mortgage. So historically, they've used a very old version. That's from the 90s, of the classic score, in, in mortgage applications. And that was actually not deliberately done. So it was just that it got written into the rules. And then since then, as a recommendation, but then it became kind of the de facto a monopoly, in that space.

</details>

问题在于，这个模型经历过上次危机，而**圣路易斯联邦储备银行**（Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis: 美国联邦储备系统中的一个地区性联邦储备银行）发现它在那种情况下根本不起作用。事实上，它在优质借款人中的违约率增长幅度甚至高于次级借款人。这种增长率是不符合模型预期运作方式的，这很令人惊讶。现在，他们已经允许使用**VantageScore 4.0**。我之所以提到这一点，是因为如前所述，它能让更多人获得房屋所有权，从而创造更多需求。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And the problem is that's a model that, went through the last crisis and the Federal Reserve, a Saint Louis actually found that it, it didn't work well at all in that situation. In fact, it saw a bigger rate of increase in delinquencies amongst those that were prime than it did amongst those that were subprime. So the rate of increase, which is not how a model supposed to work, surprisingly. Right. And so, what's happening now is that the, they have allowed for vantagescore for to be used. And the reason I say that is it's a because as I mentioned before, it a lot more people, when they have the ability to get access to homeownership. So that will create a bit more demand. Okay. Right.

</details>

另外，还需要考虑哪些人能获得这些机会。很多获得机会的人并不一定生活在房价飙升的地区。有很多农村社区，例如，如果你看哪个州在新评分下所有人的分数差异最大，实际上是**西弗吉尼亚州**。所以，这些经济体肯定会因为更多人拥有房屋而受益匪浅。其次，**抵押贷款支持证券**（Mortgage-Backed Securities, MBS: 以抵押贷款为抵押的债券）显然非常重要。它在2008年和2009年遇到了一些挑战。因此，拥有一个更好的计划非常重要，尽管这只是一个适度的方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And the other thing to think about too is who are these people that, that get access to this. Right? It's a lot of people that are not necessarily in the areas that have been, have been so crazy with house price increases. Right. There are a lot of rural communities, like. So if you look at the state where there's the biggest difference between score of all people with a new score, it's actually West Virginia. And so those economies could certainly do really well from a change to more people having home ownership. And then the second thing too, is obviously R&B is really important. Had some challenges back in 2008, 2009. Right. And so having a better plan is a very important, modest way.

</details>

我听说过那些挑战，它们似乎出现过几次。我在英国接受教育，我们倾向于轻描淡写，但拥有一个更新、更成熟的模型，一个在信用卡和其他领域过去八年里运作良好的模型，它已经成为许多其他领域最常用的模型。因此，拥有一个经过验证的、更新且更具预测性的模型，也应该有助于降低**抵押贷款支持证券**市场的系统性风险。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

I heard about those challenges. I think they came up a couple of times. I was educated in the UK. Pardon me. We have a tendency to understate things, but, you know, having a newer, more proven model, one that's, you know, worked so well and credit card and other things for the past eight years, it's become the most used model in, in many other segments. So having a proven model that's new and more predictive is should help as well with reducing the systemic risk in the arms market.

</details>

### 房贷政策调整：FICO最低分数限制的取消

请您快速澄清一下，这项规则的改变具体是什么，它如何能释放额外的需求来源？好的。以前，当你去银行并希望将贷款提交给**房利美**（Fannie Mae: 美国最大的住房抵押贷款机构之一）和**房地美**（Freddie Mac: 美国第二大住房抵押贷款机构）时，他们只能使用**FICO经典评分**来提交这些贷款。**FICO经典评分**实际上包含两到三个不同的分数，但我们可以在另一点上讨论。总之，过去有一个**620分**的最低分数限制，如果你低于这个分数，就无法提交。你可以申请**联邦住房管理局**（Federal Housing Administration, FHA: 美国住房和城市发展部下属机构，为低收入和中等收入购房者提供抵押贷款保险）贷款，但那些贷款更昂贵。你无法获得提交给**房利美**和**房地美**的普通**合规贷款**（Conforming Loan: 符合房利美和房地美规定的贷款）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Just just to go back very quickly because I don't I it sounded important. Can you just clarify a little bit more. What is this rule change such that could unlock additional source of demand? Okay. So, when you went to a bank before, wanted to submit loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Okay. They could only submit those loans using the Fico classic score. Okay, okay. Which is actually 2 or 3 different scores and go into that another point. But anyway, and and they used to be like a cutoff that if you'd have 620 then you couldn't, be able to submit it. You could go to an FHA, FHA loan. But those are more expensive. Right. But you couldn't necessarily get a, a, a normal conforming loan that goes to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

</details>

现在情况已经改变了。首先，**FICO**的最低分数限制已经被取消。现在，他们正在更新所有系统，允许贷款机构选择使用**VantageScore**。所以现在将会有选择。贷款机构可以选择他们想要使用的评分，并自行评估哪个表现更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So that's not changed. The first of all, that minimum limit of Fico been removed. And now, they are just updating all the pipes to allow them to use Vantagescore as a choice. So now there will be a choice. Lenders can choose which score they want to to use, and they can make their own evaluations about which one performs better.

</details>

### 疫情后的违约率趋势

好的，我们回到去年底，您看到了收入尚可的人群中违约率的上升，也许他们没有那么多的财富。请告诉我们具体数字。这些数字有多大？它们让人们感到多么惊讶？以及为什么会出现这种违约压力？好的，好消息是这些数据从去年底就已经可用了。但当我们审视这些数据时，高收入者的违约率确实低于中等收入者，而中等收入者的违约率又低于低收入者，这并不令人惊讶。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Okay, so let's go back to, starting at the end of last year. And you saw that increase in delinquencies among fairly, people with decent incomes. Maybe they didn't have as much. Well, talk to us about the numbers. How big were these numbers? How much did they catch people by surprise? And what is the story there about why there was this delinquency pressure? Well, so, you know, the good thing is it's available since the end of last year. But, you know, when we're looking at this data, then again, look, high income earners, not surprisingly, have lower delinquency rates than middle income earners. And that had themselves lower delinquency rates than the lower income. Right.

</details>

但很少有人关注这种同比趋势和动量。我总是关注动量，因为我试图及早了解事态的发展。当时，我们看到，让我们回顾一下，我认为这可以更好地解释经济中正在发生的事情。疫情发生时，大量刺激措施出台，许多**延期偿付计划**（Forbearance Programs: 允许借款人暂时停止或减少贷款支付的计划）也随之实施。因此，许多人的信用健康状况以及他们在信用档案中的表现都显著改善。他们还清了信用卡，积累了储蓄。这是一个良好的局面，虽然是暂时的，但确实不错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

But not a lot of people were looking at that kind of year over year trend and the momentum. Right. I'm always looking at momentum because I'm trying to get an early read on kind of how things are developing. And so at the time, you know, we saw actually let's go back a little bit because I think it can explain a little bit more about what's going on in the economy. Is that right? So, when the pandemic happens, right, a lot of stimulus comes in, a lot of forbearance programs are put in place as a result of that. So many people's, you know, credit, health and the way that they appear on the on the credit files improved dramatically. They're paying down their credit cards. They were building up their savings. It was a it was a good situation, temporary, but good.

</details>

但随后，2021年和2022年悄然来临，我们开始看到情况并非持续性的，而是一次性的。我们开始看到违约率再次上升。我们看到的情况并不令人惊讶，特别是考虑到当时通货膨胀正在大规模爆发，最初受到影响并出现最大增长的是低收入家庭。在最初的六到九个月里，这个群体经历了最大的同比增长。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

But then, you know, 20, 21, 22 starts creeping in and we start seeing that, okay. This is not a persistent situation. This was a one off. Right? And we started seeing delinquency rates starting to come up again. Right. What we saw, which shouldn't be too surprising, particularly given that that was when inflation was kicking in, in a, in a big way, was that those that were initially impacted and who are seeing the biggest rises were the lower income households. Right. So for the first sort of, you know, six months, nine months, that was the group that was seeing the biggest year over year increases.

</details>

但随后我们开始看到，进入**2023年**后，中高收入家庭也开始受到影响。这可能与低收入家庭可支配收入较少，储蓄也较少有关，所以他们最先感受到痛苦。但当你的收入和支出之间存在持续不平衡时，即使你有三万或五万美元的储蓄，也会开始耗尽。这就是我们开始在中高收入家庭中看到的情况，因为与此同时，他们也受到了许多压力的冲击。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

But then what we started seeing was that, you know, come 2023 forward, we actually started seeing that, then the middle and higher income households were starting being impacted, too. And that's probably related to the fact that lower income households had less, disposable or income, but they also had less savings put away so that, you know, they're the first to feel the pain. But then when there is this consistent imbalance between your inflows and outflows, right, you can even if you have, you know, 30,000 or 50,000 that's put away, that's going to start depleting. And that's what we started seeing happening even with these higher income households, because at the same time, you know, they were hit by so many pressures.

</details>

在疫情后的几年里，我们看到了有史以来最大的租金上涨。我们还看到汽车价格、汽车融资成本飙升，以及各种其他成本也大幅上涨。所以，高收入人群并非对这一切免疫。作为经济学家，很多人总是说，当通货膨胀来临时，它对低收入家庭的影响更大，因为面包、牛奶等生活必需品的价格上涨。高收入人群不会买贵一百倍的牛奶，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Right. Biggest rent increases I think we'd ever seen it came into, you know, came into effect those few years after Covid. Right. We saw things on, you know, car prices, the cost of auto financing going up through the roof and then various other things, you know, very other costs also went up substantially. And so, you know, it's not that higher income people were immune from this, right? Also, you know, as an economist, you know, a lot of people always talk about, hey, when inflation kicks in, it disproportionately impacts lower income households because the cost of bread, the cost of milk, etc.. You know, it's not like high income people buy milk. That's 100 times more expensive, right?

</details>

但现实是，如果你审视人们的大额开支，其中许多实际上是与收入挂钩的。例如租金，收入越高的人往往租金也越高。其他大额开支，如育儿、教育等，也越来越与收入挂钩。当然，收入达到一定水平后，情况就不再适用。但如果我们仍然讨论年收入在**15万到25万美元**左右的家庭，他们也确实感受到了痛苦。他们需要更长的时间才能感受到违约率的影响，但他们确实开始感受到了痛苦。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

But the reality is, is if you look at people's big outlays, right, many of those actually scale with income rent, for instance, people that earn more tend to rent higher. Other big outlays such as, you know, their, child care, education and other things. They also have been scaling more with income. Now, obviously there's a level of income that you know that that does not apply to. But if we still talk about that cohort, 150 to 250 or so of household income, they're definitely seeing that they felt the pain too. They it took them longer before it started impacting their delinquencies. But they did start feeling the pain.

</details>

### 违约率的积极信号与经济展望

好消息是，当我们开始审视今年下半年时，我们在今年上半年仍然看到高收入人群的违约率大幅上升。但自**7月**以来，根据我掌握的**10月**数据，自7月以来的四个月中有三个月，我们看到高收入家庭的违约率有所下降。这是一个好兆头。我之所以说这是一个好兆头，并不是因为我喜欢让**K型经济**更加突出，而是因为美国经济的很大一部分是由消费支出驱动的。您之前提到，高收入家庭对消费支出的影响不成比例，所以如果这部分支出枯竭，将对整个经济产生连锁反应。因此，我们看到这个群体的违约率开始下降，我认为隧道尽头出现了一线光明。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

The good news though is, that as we started looking at the second half of this year, right, so we still saw those delinquencies and high incomes rising very heavily at the beginning, the first half of this year. But since July, and I've got data from October. So, you know, of the three of the four months since July, we've seen that higher income households came down. So that's a good sign. And the reason I say that's a good sign is not because I'm a fan of making the k-shaped economy even more so. But the fact that so much of the U.S. economy is driven by spending, and you mentioned earlier that high income households disproportionately impact, that and so if that dries up, that has a knock on effect on the whole economy. So to the fact that we're seeing that cohort, that those delinquencies are starting to come down, I think there's some light at the end of the tunnel.

</details>

这让我想起，我一直想知道像**黑色星期五**（Black Friday: 感恩节后的第一个星期五，美国传统购物日）或圣诞节这样的大型购物活动，在衡量消费者情绪方面有多大用处？你总是会看到头条新闻，今年也肯定看到了，比如“黑色星期五消费创纪录”。但你也会看到有人分析这些消费，说“实际上是因为每个人都承受着巨大压力，他们真的需要低价，所以他们什么都买”。这样的活动对你来说有多大用处？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

that reminds me, actually, I always wondered, how useful are big shopping events like Black Friday or Christmas in terms of gauging consumer sentiment? So you you always see the headlines. You certainly saw them this year, you know, record Black Friday spending. But then you also see people break down that spending and say, well, actually it's because everyone is so pressured. They really need the low prices. So they're buying everything. Now, how useful is something like that to you?

</details>

你总是能看到趋势，对吧？所以从一个角度来看，关注**黑色星期五**、**网络星期一**（Cyber Monday: 感恩节后的第一个星期一，线上购物日）等各种数据总是好的，因为在过去20年里，人们在这些周末的消费方式存在细微差别。但如果你看过去三年，你就能开始看到正在发生的事情。但我一直无法理解的是，假日消费的同比增长中有多少是由商品价格上涨驱动的，而不是人们购买了传统上更昂贵的商品或更多地挥霍。这对我来说并不明显。我认为，在试图理解经济走向时，从消费角度来看，实际观察不同的商家非常重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

You know, you can always see trends, right? And so you know that from one perspective, it's always good to look at a number of different things, such as spending on Black Friday, Cyber Monday, etc., because, you know, there are nuances into how people have been spending for those weekends over 20 years. But still, if you look at the last three years, you can start to see things that are happening. But the thing that, you know, I haven't been able to get my head around is how much of that year over year increase in spending in the holidays is driven by the prices of the goods going up. Yeah. Versus people buying things that would have traditionally been more expensive or splurging more that for me isn't obvious. And I think that again, when trying to understand how the economy is going, it's so important if you're looking at from a spending perspective to actually look at the different merchants.

</details>

例如，**麦当劳**（McDonald's）表现如何，那里的趋势是什么？高端市场发生了什么？**路易威登**（LVMH）与**沃尔玛**（Walmart）相比表现如何？因为，尽管我说高收入消费者的情况正在好转，中等收入者的违约率有所下降，但仍在上升，而低收入者的违约率仍持续高企，同比上涨8%。所以，明年你可能会看到比今年更多的家庭入不敷出。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Right. So how is McDonald's doing and what are the trends there? What's happening in high end? How is LVMH doing versus, you know, Walmart, etc.. And so, because again, you know, even though I said that, you know, there's a silver lining in the high income, consumers are, you know, seeing declines, middle income have come down, but they're still increasing and low income are are staying persistently higher on 8% year over year increases, in their delinquency rates. And so again, there's we're probably next to you. You're going to see more more households struggling to make ends meet than we saw this year.

</details>

我仍然不认为仅仅看趋势就会出现任何重大的转折点。但需要记住的是，如果你看现在的情况，例如**摩根大通**（JPMorgan）发布的数据显示，人们支票账户中的现金正在减少。这意味着，如果系统在某个时候受到重大冲击，将面临更大的挑战。我无法预见任何系统性冲击，但这始终是需要警惕的一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

I still don't think that there is, you know, you know, just looking at the trends going to be any kind of major break point. But the thing to bear in mind with that, though, is that if you look at here the situation and you look at, for instance, JP Morgan published that, you know, the amount of cash people have in their checking accounts is coming down. So it just means that there is more of a challenge if there's a big shock to the system at some point. Not that I can foresee any shock to the system, but it's always something to be a little bit wary of.

### 收入与财富对违约率的影响

在我们继续之前，我想快速回到您刚才说的一点。您说，直观上，高收入人群的违约率会低于中等收入人群，而中等收入人群的违约率会低于低收入人群。这对我来说并不直观，因为我也会想象承保标准非常不同。对我来说，高收入人群违约率低于低收入人群并不明显，因为我猜想贷款机构了解他们的收入，并且会对低收入人群的贷款进行更严格的审查。那么，为什么会出现这种趋势，考虑到他们没有获得相同的贷款条款或相同的贷款可获得性？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

before we going, I want to go back to something you said very quickly. You said, okay, intuitively, people with higher incomes, they're going to have delinquencies at a lower rate than people's middle incomes, and they're going to have, delinquencies, a lower rate than people with lower incomes. That's not intuitive to me, actually, because I would also imagine that underwrite is very different, etc. it's not obvious to me why higher income people default less than lower income people, because I would imagine lenders know their income and they're going to have, you know, they're going to scrutinize the loan of a lower income person much more intensely, etc.. So why why should this trend exist, given that they are don't they don't get they don't don't get the same loan terms or same loan availability?

</details>

不，他们确实没有。而且，高收入家庭通常比低收入家庭拥有更昂贵的汽车。然而，高收入家庭往往有更多的能力存钱，或者他们拥有其他资产。贷款机构知道高收入家庭可能拥有更多的储蓄，而收入非常紧张的家庭可能几乎没有我们所说的**财富缓冲**。那么，为什么这没有直接纳入承保标准呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

No they don't. And you know, a high income household by typically is more expensive than a car than a low income household. Well, but higher income households tend to have more of an ability to squirrel some money away, or they tend to have, other assets that they can't or knows that the lender knows that the higher income, household is going to have likely more savings than the lender knows, that the household that's in a very tight income probably has very little, cushion in the form of what we call wealth. And so why doesn't that just get baked into the underwriting standards?

</details>

在某些方面，它确实被纳入了。当你为高收入且信用记录良好的人审批贷款时，你对他们违约的预期会非常低。所以这已经体现在定价中，而且你显然不仅仅看信用评分。你还会看他们的收入以及其他各种重要指标，以确定合适的贷款金额。但高收入消费者可能不需要像低收入家庭那样，承担与其收入比例而言那么多的债务来满足他们的需求。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Well, in in ways it does. Right. And so, you know, when you're, you know, you're underwriting a loan for, let's say, somebody who is high income and has a good credit history, your expectation of their default is going to be incredibly low, right? So that's built into the pricing and that's built into, you know, and you obviously don't just look at a credit score. You look at, you know, what their income is and various other important metrics to be able to determine the appropriate amount that you will lend them, etc.. Right. But higher income consumers may not need to take on as much debt as a proportion to their income as lower income households to make. But, you know, to to get through what they need to do. Right.

</details>

例如，如果你看一个高收入家庭，尽管住房和汽车成本可能是他们最大的开支，但从比例上讲，它们可能低于低收入家庭。所以，这很大程度上与比例有关。但同时，他们也往往拥有更多的储备，以便能够度过难关。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And so if you look at, for instance, a high income household, how much of their, even though, for instance, probably housing and car costs are some of the biggest outlays they have, proportionately, they're probably less than for lower income households. Right. And so you know, a lot of it has to do with that proportionality. But then also just that, again, they will tend to have a bit more reserves so that they can ride through situations.

### 汽车贷款违约率飙升的深层原因

请谈谈汽车贷款违约率。它们一直在上升。显然，现在有很多贷款正在进行。**特蕾西**提到了**2020年至2022年**期间的汽车。汽车价格本身也在上涨。所以不仅利率上升了，我们还看到了大量的**汽车通货膨胀**（Auto Inflation: 汽车价格的普遍上涨）。这在各个层面都造成了压力。我们看到数字在上升。这其中有什么引人入胜的故事吗？人们对汽车贷款投入了大量关注，因为在2022年，汽车贷款违约率突然开始比其他类型的贷款违约率上升得更快。这显然对汽车贷款机构和整个经济产生了深远影响。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Talk to us about auto delinquencies. Those have been rising. And obviously there's a lot of lending going on. Again, Tracy mentioned a sort of 2020 to 2022 vintage car prices themselves are going up. So not only have the rates gone up, but we've seen a tremendous amount of auto inflation. So sort of stress at every level. We see the numbers going up. One of those tell us as a fascinating story. There's been a lot of interest, that was paid attention to auto loans because, you know, suddenly in 2022, we started seeing this auto loan delinquencies going up much faster than other types of loan delinquencies. And it was having a profound effect, obviously, on auto lenders and the economy as a whole.

</details>

每个人都在试图解释。你看，我们在疫情期间和其他时候有点过于宽松，然后他们开始调整贷款标准。所以他们确实在**2023年**左右调整了贷款标准。但我们仍然看到，尽管如此，违约率仍在持续上升。当我们查看数据时，我们发现，通过调整贷款标准，他们确实产生了影响，次级汽车贷款的违约率在此之后大幅下降。所以他们确实产生了这种效果。但我们看到**次优级**和**优质级**的违约率继续上升。这就是导致整体增长的原因。所以我们意识到这里有更深层的原因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And, you know, everybody is trying explain. Well, you see, we got a bit too loose during the period of Covid and other things, and they started adjusting their lending criteria. Right? So they did adjust their lending criteria, around 2023 for most of them. But then we started, we still saw that despite that, the delinquency rates kept persistently increasing. And then when we looked at the data, we actually saw that, you know, when you they had actually had an impact by adjusting their landing, their lending criteria, we saw that the delinquency rates among subprime auto lenders, where auto loans reduced quite dramatically after that. So they did have that effect. But we saw that the delinquency rates on near prime and Prime continued to go up. And that was what drove that increase. And so we realized there's something more going on here.

</details>

而且为什么会如此不同呢？所以我们追溯了很久，回溯到**2010年**，试图了解发生了什么。因为很少有人从那个时间尺度来看待问题，但这实际上非常引人入胜，因为在2010年，汽车贷款是当时所有贷款产品中表现最好的，风险最低。这一直是人们的说法：美国人永远不会放弃他们的汽车。即使失业，他们也可以睡在车里，住在车里，这听起来很反乌托邦。但我记得一位银行家，一位当时正在打包电话贷款的银行家，亲口告诉我这个故事。他说，另一件事是，没有人会放弃他们的手机。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And also why is it it's so different. So we went back a long time. We went back to 2010 to try to understand kind of what's been going on. Because not many people look at it from that time scale, but it's actually quite fascinating because back in 2010, auto had the best performance of any loan product at the time, it was the least risky. This was always the narrative. The Americans will never give up their cars. Even if they lose their job. They can sleep in their car and live in the car, which is very dystopian. But that's I remember hearing that story literally from a banker, a banker who was actually working on bundling phone loans. And he was like, the other thing, right? Yeah. No one will give up their phone. Yeah.

</details>

所以，当时它的表现很好。人们在汽车贷款上的违约率不像其他产品那样高。但我们看到，在过去的15年里，它已经发生了转变，到了今年第一季度，它成为了市场上风险最高的信贷产品。随后，学生贷款问题也开始浮现，那是另一个故事了。学生贷款的违约率正处于历史最高水平。但在汽车贷款方面，我们追查了原因。我们发现有几个因素，有些是显而易见的，有些则比较微妙。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So, you know, so at that time it was, you know, it was a it performed well. Right. And people did not default as much on that as on other products. But then we've seen it has transitioned over that 15 year period to now, you know, being the first quarter of this year, it was the riskiest credit product out there. And then subsequently student loans started coming in. And that's another story. You know, those delinquency rates are at historic levels. But on the auto loan side, we then trot out what's causing this. Right? And so what we've seen was that, there's a number of factors, some of them obvious, some of them a little bit more subtle, right.

</details>

汽车的平均成本大幅上涨。我们看到，汽车贷款的平均贷款价值增长超过了任何其他贷款价值。这听起来可能没什么，但如果你想想，抵押贷款通常是导致增长最多的，因为房价随着时间大幅上涨。所以，在过去的15年里，平均汽车贷款的增长超过了平均抵押贷款，这很有说服力。其次，显然存在**双重打击**（Double Whammy: 指同时受到两种负面影响）。汽车不仅更贵了，而且最近的利率也更高了。所以，他们不仅要支付更多的本金，还要支付更多的利息。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

The average cost of a car has gone up an incredible amount. And what we've seen is then the average loan value for, auto loans has increased more than any other loan value. And that may sound like okay, but if you think about it, mortgages tend to be the one that caused the most because house prices have appreciated so much over time. So the fact that the average auto loan has grown more than the average mortgage has over that 15 year period is telling. Okay. Secondly, obviously there is this you know, there's this double whammy. So not only is the car more expensive, but then more recently interest rates have been higher. Right. And so you know, they're not going to have to pay more, not just for the principal but also the interest.

</details>

但我认为，让许多消费者措手不及的一点是，他们在经销商那里看到了一些数字，有些人理解了，觉得“好的，我们仍然可以做到，我们可以勉强凑合”。因为我认为人们试图购买与之前相同或稍好的汽车，我认识很多人都在**降级**（Downgrading: 购买比之前更便宜或功能更少的商品）。所以他们认为，“这是同一辆车，是的，贵了一点，但我们能应付。”但他们经常忘记的是，保险费大幅上涨，拥有成本也大幅上涨。维修成本也大幅上涨。所以当所有这些费用都压下来时，他们可能会发现自己无法应付。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

But I think one of the things that has caught many, consumers off guard is, okay, so they're in the dealership, they're being shown some numbers, some people get it and they go like, okay, yes, we can still do that. We can make it work. We can just about mix and stretch. Because also I think people are trying to buy either the same that they had before or slightly better. I know many people like downgrading okay. And so they think, well, it's the same car and yes, there's a little bit more, but we can make ends meet, right? By looking at these numbers. But what they often forget about is that insurance has gone up significantly, as have just the cost of ownership. Repair costs have also gone up substantially. And so when all those things then hit them, they can be in a situation where we just can't make it work.

</details>

所以，这不好。好消息是，在所有贷款产品中，抵押贷款表现相当不错。它们正在增加，但仍然远低于2010年，也远低于2008年至2009年。但如果你拖欠抵押贷款，需要一段时间才会真正发生什么。而汽车贷款，他们会来把你的车开走。考虑到很多人依赖汽车去上班、赚钱、购物或送孩子上学等重要任务，人们不会轻易拖欠汽车贷款。所以我认为，这表明越来越多的家庭正在努力维持生计。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And so, you know, that's that's not good. And, you know, the good thing is, of all the loan products, mortgages are performing pretty well. Okay. That's they are increasing, but they're still much, much lower than they were back in 2010 and obviously much lower than 28 to 29. So, but if you default on a mortgage, it takes some time before anything really happens, right? With an auto loan, they they will come and they will take that car away from you. And given that, you know, so many people rely on that car to go to their job, to make their income to, you know, to do other tasks, they're important, like they're shopping or taking their children to the school or other things that they need to do. People don't willingly just default on these auto loans. And so I think it is a sign that correlates with the fact that, you know, more households are struggling to make ends meet.

</details>

### 杠杆率与“先买后付”的隐形风险

你们对杠杆率有多少了解？我之所以问这个问题，是因为我们看到**“先买后付”**（Buy Now Pay Later, BNPL: 一种允许消费者分期付款的短期融资方式）项目爆炸式增长。现在你几乎在每个网站上都能看到三种不同的小额贷款选择，而据我所知，其中只有少数会向信用局报告。而且我还可以想象，如果你是一个可能承受更大压力的低收入人群，你可能会向家人求助，比如“嘿，能借我500美元撑到月底吗？”信用评分机构不可能了解这种非正式贷款。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

How much insight do you have into leverage? And the reason I ask is because we've seen an explosion in buy now pay later. Programs, virtually every site you go to now has three different options for getting a loan for a small amount, and only a few of those. My understanding is are actually reporting to the credit bureaus. So and I can also imagine if you're a lower income person who is perhaps more pressured, you're probably going to turn to a family member and say something like, hey, can you loan me, I don't know, 500 bucks to make it to the end of the month? And there's no way that credit scoring bureaus are going to have insight into things like that. Informal loans.

</details>

来自信用局的信用数据仍然非常具有生产力和实用性，但它并不能捕捉所有信息。例如，**Alex**最近提到，**Affirm**（一家BNPL公司）已经开始向信用档案提供数据，这很棒，但并非所有BNPL公司都这样做。所以，我认为仍然有很多信息是不可见的，这无疑是贷款机构关注的问题。我们听到了他们对**堆叠贷款**（Stacking: 消费者同时从多个BNPL提供商处获得贷款）等问题的担忧。显然，这些公司之所以能发展到今天，是因为他们自己对风险有一定的了解。所以他们不一定会让一个表现不佳的借款人再申请五笔BNPL贷款。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

There's, you know, the credit data that comes from the credit bureaus is still incredibly productive and useful, but it doesn't capture everything. Like Alex was on I think recently, a firm has is done to provision data to the credit file, which is great, but that not all of them are there. And so, you know, I think there is still a lot that's not visible. And that is definitely a concern to lenders. We've been here their concerns about stacking and and things of that nature. Obviously, you know, these companies haven't got to where they are without having some understanding of risk themselves. Right. So they're not going to necessarily just let someone who's not performing a loan take out another five Bnpl loans.

</details>

消费者去所有不同的BNPL提供商那里使用这些服务，这需要一定的努力和复杂性。当然，我相信会有一些人这样做，但我不知道有多少人属于这一类。尽管如此，更多信息不可见仍然是一个问题。这就是为什么我认为，能够获取信用档案数据之外的更多信息，例如**现金流数据**（Cash Flow Data: 记录资金流入和流出的数据），变得非常重要。我们看到越来越多的贷款机构正在寻求将**现金流**纳入审批流程，因为这样他们就能更好地了解资金的进出情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Right. And the ability of a consumer to go to all different Bnpl providers and use that. There's a level of effort and sophistication required to do that there. Certainly I'm sure there going to be some, but I don't know how many people fall into that category. Nevertheless, it is a concern that more is invisible. And that's why I think, you know, being able to pull in more than credit file data, such as cash flow data becomes really important. And so what we're seeing is that there are more and more on, that are looking to incorporate cash flow into the process because then they can have a better understanding of the ins and outs.

</details>

例如，他们的支票账户余额是随着时间增加还是减少？他们的收入看起来稳定吗？还是更零星？所以我们现在已经开始构建也包含这类数据的信用评分。我认为这在未来会变得更加重要，因为消费者借款的方式会越来越多。所以这可能是获得全面视图的更好方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Right? Is their checking balance, going up or declining over time. You know, are there is that does our income look like it stable? Does it look like it's more sporadic. And so we still have started building now credit scores that also incorporate that type of data. And that I think is going to become even more important, as we go forward, because there are going to be more and more ways that consumers can borrow. So that's probably the better way to get that holistic view.

</details>

### 贷款违约率的最新趋势与未来展望

那么，汽车贷款违约率现在是否处于历史最高水平，或者接近？是的，它们确实是。而且它们还在继续上升。然而，我们看到信用卡等其他类型的贷款违约率大幅上升，例如信用卡违约率在2023年和2024年大幅上升，但现在已经开始下降。我们也看到个人贷款违约率开始下降。所以这是一个非常细致的局面。我们看到**证券化贷款**（Securitized Delinquencies: 经过证券化处理的贷款的违约率）的违约率今年同比开始下降。但我们仍然看到抵押贷款和汽车贷款的违约率持续上升，这在某种程度上是令人费解的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

so quickly. Auto delinquencies, are they are they at their highest level ever right now or close like. Yep. I mean they are. Yes. And so you know and and they're continuing to to go up. So what we have seen though is that credit cards, for instance, they went up a lot. So they went on to delinquencies. Credit card delinquencies went up a lot in 2324. But they've started coming down and we started seeing personal loans coming down as well. So it's a very nuanced picture. So we've seen the and securitized, delinquencies have started coming down this year, year over year. But we're still seeing mortgage and auto loans continue that, you know, to continue to increase, which is pretty topsy turvy when you kind of think about it.

</details>

现在正在发生的另一件事是保险费率上涨。我想是因为之前的补贴没有延长。你在社交媒体上到处都能看到人们发布他们**2026年**的新保险费率。我看到了一些疯狂的例子，比如每月从**600美元涨到1800美元**。您预计明年这样的上涨会对消费者造成多大压力？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So the other thing happening now is, insurance rates going up. Because of the, I guess non extension of previous subsidies. And one thing you're seeing all over social media is people posting their new insurance rates for 2026. And I've seen some crazy ones, you know, something going from $600 to like $1,800 a month. How much pressure would you expect something like that to exert on the consumer for next year?

</details>

对于许多人来说，这可能是压垮骆驼的最后一根稻草。特别是汽车保险，对许多家庭来说可能是一笔非常大的开支。但还有其他保险，比如房主保险也在上涨。特别是在加利福尼亚州或佛罗里达州等地区，自然灾害导致保费上涨高于全国平均水平。所以，我仍然不认为会有任何单一事件导致整个系统崩溃。但与此同时，越来越多的家庭会因为那一次意想不到的上涨而陷入困境，导致他们无法支付当月或数月的款项。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

It's you know, for many it's going to be the straw that could break the camel's back, right? It's just, you know, particularly if it's just like car insurance can be a very significant outlay for for many households. But, you know, there's other insurance for homeowners. Homeowner's insurance is going up. And particularly if they're in areas like California or Florida where, you know, natural disasters have led to, you know, an increase in premiums above the national average. And so, again, like, I don't see that there's any one thing that is going to cause a, the house to fall down. But at the same time, just there's more and more households where that that one unexpected increase puts them in a, in a, in a situation that then makes it impossible for them to make, their, their payments that month or for a number of months.

</details>

### 学生贷款偿还恢复的影响

请谈谈学生贷款支付的恢复。您提到了刺激措施的重要性，以及所有这些**延期偿付**。所有这些事情中，唯一一个不断被推迟的就是学生贷款的恢复偿还。当这些数字重新启动，或者说这些支付重新开始时，产生了多大的影响？我们看到了学生贷款违约率的什么情况？是的，它产生了非常大的影响。如果我们回顾疫情之前，平均学生贷款违约率大约在**10%**左右，在**9%到11%**之间波动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Talk to us about the resumption of student loan payments. I mean, you mentioned the importance of the it's not only the stimulus, but all that sort of forbearance. And so all this stuff is the one thing that just kept getting pushed forever was the resumption of student loans. How much when that when those numbers turned back on or those payments turned back on. How what kind of impact did that have? And what are we seeing with student loan delinquencies? Yeah, it had a very big impact. And so, you know, if we look back before Covid, the average, student loan delinquency rate was around that 10% was sort of wavering around between 9 and 11% in that sort of range.

</details>

然后，在这五年的**延期偿付**期间，由于在2024年至2025年之间有一年的时间，他们开始需要付款但没有被报告。所以这基本上是一段很长的时间，人们习惯了不需要支付这笔款项。而且，很大一部分学生贷款借款人从未支付过款项，因为他们在**延期偿付**期间完成了学业或处于该时期。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And then obviously in this five year period, of, of forbearance, as I know, reporting, because you had a period of a year between 24 and 25, through 24 where, they were starting to need to make payments, but they just weren't being reported. So that's a basically a long period of time where people just got used to not having to make that payment. And also a very substantial part of student loan borrowers who never had ever made a payment because they, you know, they finished their their studies or they, you know, in a period when there was forbearance.

</details>

随后发生的是，他们从今年**2月中旬**开始陆续重新出现在信用档案中。然后我认为第一批真正出现是在**5月**。那时你看到未延期学生贷款的违约率超过了**20%**。所以它们是历史正常水平的两倍多，达到了有史以来最高水平。这是我们追溯很久以来看到的最高水平。请记住，在它不是联邦强制执行和私人拥有时，发生了很多变化。所以我无法追溯那么远，但至少在近期历史上，这绝对是最高水平，而且幅度非常大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And so what then happened was they started trickling back onto the credit file sort of mid-February of this year. And then I think you got the first batch really kind of come in by May. And at that point you saw that the delinquency rates on the student loans that were not in deferment was over 20%. So they were over double what the historical norm was since then. And at the highest level ever, it is the highest level that we've seen going back a long, long time. So remember, there's been a lot of changes when it was not federally mandated and privately owned. So I don't have visibility going back as that far, but at least in recent history, is absolutely the highest by a very substantial amount.

</details>

这并不太令人惊讶。但我们看到的一点是，我们预计会有一部分人并非故意违约。有些人搬家了，没有收到地址变更通知，或者很多人因为收到了太多混杂的信息而感到困惑，比如“我们会被赦免”，但事实并非如此，或者“我们有某个项目”，但现在这个项目已经不存在了。所以，有些人已经能够解决这个问题。因此，违约率已经下降到**17%或17.5%**，这是一个好兆头。所以情况正在改善。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And that's not too surprising. But one of the things that we've seen is that we expected that there would be some people who go into delinquency not because they intended to. Right. And so there were some people who they moved and they didn't get the addresses or a lot of people that were confused because there's so many mixed messages like, we're going to be forgiven, but there were not and we're not certain program. But now that program doesn't exist anymore. So, you know, some people have been able to then address that. And so it's come down to this or 17, 17.5%, which is a good sign. And so that's improving.

</details>

但仍然有一些人正在参与已被取消的项目，比如**SAFE项目**。所以他们明年将不得不要么参加另一个**延期偿付计划**，要么开始支付款项。所以，我们可能还没有看到学生贷款恢复偿还的全部影响。我们看到了最大批次的还款，但仍然有一些消费者借款人，他们的现有计划将到期，或者尚未被报告，因为服务商正在努力弄清楚具体情况，然后才会向信用局报告。所以，在信用服务商方面，仍然存在一些可见度不足的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

But there still are people who are on programs that have, that have been killed, like the, the Safe program. And so they are going to next year, have to either get on to another forbearance program or start making payments. And so it's maybe we haven't seen the full effect. Then basically of the resumption of student loans, which we've seen the biggest batch come through, but there still are some more, cohorts of consumer borrowers. That will either have their existing program expire, or that aren't being reported yet because, and the servicers are trying to figure out exactly what's going on before they report to the credit bureau. So there still is a little bit of lack of visibility there from on the credit servicer side.

</details>

### 总结：消费者信贷的脆弱性

**里卡德**，非常感谢您来到**《Odd Lots》**。这很棒。谢谢，非常感谢。**特蕾西**，它总是回到保险问题上，不是吗？那总是美中不足的地方。你知道，你买了这辆车，然后说：“好的，这是车，这是利息支付。我想我们能算得过来。”但你无法控制保险费会是多少。你根本不知道会是多少。这是我的理论：保险公司秘密地操控着这一切。他们操控着世界。他们确实如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Rikard, thank you so much for coming on Odd Lots That was great. Thank you. Thank you so much. Tracy, It always comes back to, insurance doesn't it? That's always like the thing the there's, the little fly in the ointment is, you know, you buy this car and it's like, okay, here's the car and here's the interest payment. Oh, I think we can make the math work, but you can't control what that insurance payment is going to be. You have no idea what it's going to be. This is my theory. Insurers secretly run this. They were on the run. The world. They really do.

</details>

你知道，我还在想另一件事，我们在时事通讯中也写过，但我们当前经济时刻的困难之一是，总体数据中存在如此多的分歧和差异。如果你只看一个单一的数字，一个总数，比如你看美国人的平均**FICO评分**，现在它几乎什么都不能告诉你，因为个体差异太大了。是的，这确实归结为**财富**。财富是经济中如此重要的一个因素。我们总是谈论收入和收入不平等，当然那是一个真实存在的现象。但财富是任何事物如此重要的预测因素和驱动因素。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

You know, the other thing I was thinking, and we've written about this in the newsletter, but one of the difficulties of our current economic moment is there is so much division and difference built into the aggregate. If you're just looking at a single number, a total, like if you looked at the average Fico score of an American, it tells you almost nothing now because the the individuals are so disparate. Yeah. And it really does come down to, you know, wealth. Right. And there's this this is what wealth is just such an important factor in the economy. We always talk about income and income inequality and of course that's a real phenomenon. But wealth is such an important predictor driver of anything.

它也再次表明了金融市场和资产价格对实体经济的重要性。它再次给了我一个机会说：**股市就是经济**，因为我们生活在一个由财富驱动的经济中。你知道，有人曾经给我写信，我写了一些关于低收入人群压力的文章，有人回信说：“为什么低收入人群不拥有更多资产呢？如果他们有，他们的处境就会更好。”你有没有试过不穷？你为什么不试着变得富有？你为什么不试着20年前买**英伟达**（NVIDIA: 一家全球领先的图形处理器和人工智能芯片制造商）？你为什么不在2009年经济危机后在加利福尼亚买房？就这么简单。别再穷了。真的。

And it also goes to show like how important like financial market and asset prices are to the real economy. And it gives me once again an opportunity to say the stock market is the economy, because we live in such a wealth driven economy. You know, someone once wrote into me, I wrote something about pressures on lower income people, and someone wrote into me saying, well, why don't the lower income people own more assets? If they did, they'd be in a better position. Have you tried not being poor? Why haven't you tried just being rich? Why haven't you tried buying in video 20 years ago? Why have you tried buying a house in California in 2009 after the bust? It's that simple. Stop being poor. Seriously.

关于汽车违约率，我还在想**“降级消费”**（Trade Down: 消费者购买更便宜或功能更少的产品以节省开支）的故事也是一个重要部分。我的意思是，十年前的汽车现在也相当不错。我这么说是因为我本人就拥有一辆大约2011年的**丰田RAV4**。是的，它非常可靠，我真的不觉得有必要买一辆花哨的新车。我想，如果你在汽车贷款方面承受压力，找到一辆相对可靠的旧车可能并不那么困难。

The other thing I was thinking just on auto delinquency is I also think the trade down story is a big piece here, which is, I mean, a car from ten years ago now is pretty decent. And I say that as someone who owns, I think it's a, Toyota Rav4 from like 2011 or something like that. Oh, yeah. Like it's pretty dependable and I don't really feel the need to get like a fancy new car. And I imagine if you're under pressure on your car loan, it's probably like not that difficult necessarily to find an older car that is somewhat reliable.

你知道，有一件事。我有一辆2015年买的车。它运行得非常好，我一点也不惊讶它会继续这样，完全没问题。但它没有**CarPlay**（苹果公司开发的车载系统）。是的，旧车和新车之间的一个区别是，新车有很好的界面，比如一个小扬声器。但它没有那种带有地图的漂亮界面。我知道这听起来有点小问题，但它就像“哦，你有地图吗？”它有一个非常糟糕的内置地图，不是那种非常清晰的**谷歌地图**（Google Maps），也没有**逐向导航**（Turn-by-Turn Navigation）。我知道这听起来有点小，但这非常烦人。当我开一辆有现代漂亮界面的车，有漂亮的**谷歌地图**或**苹果地图**（Apple Maps）以及**Spotify**（一家全球领先的音乐流媒体服务平台）集成时，感觉非常好。而且显然我们把它送到经销商那里，他们就是无法升级。是的，它无法升级。出于某种原因，无法安装新的仪表盘。

I don't know, you know, the one thing though. So I have a car, that I bought in 2015. It runs, perfectly. Well, I would not be surprised if it continued like, no issues at all. It doesn't have CarPlay integration. Oh yeah. The one difference between an older cars and newer cars is that it's very nice. Like having that know that that interface where you have like, got a little speaker or something. Yeah. But what it doesn't have is that like really nice interface with the map. Like, and I know that to minor, but it's like, oh, do you have a map. It has a really it has it's a Subaru. For those curious, and it's like, you know, it's like they're in-house to crappy map. It's not the really nice like Google Maps where it's, like, really clear and it doesn't have turn by turn navigation. I know this sounds like kind of minor, but it is very annoying. And like when I am in a car that has like a modern, I have a little tangent here when I am in a car that has like a really nice interface with, a nice Google Maps or Apple Maps and the Spotify integration. It's very nice. And apparently we've taken into the dealer, they just cannot. It is on. Oh really? Yeah, it's on upgradable. There's no for some reason there is no way to put in a new dash. Oh, sorry. I thought you meant un upgradable in terms of trading it in for. No no no don't. Upgradeable is like we cannot like this. We could never install CarPlay or whatever. Yeah.

我和我丈夫租了一辆那种又大又豪华的皮卡车。我被它的便利设施惊呆了。是的，包括加热座椅，我个性化的加热座椅。是的，那很高级。你知道，冬天有加热座椅非常舒服。我们再多聊一会儿汽车吧。但问题是，即使是那样的车，我无法想象花**10万美元**加上实际利率去买。我记得2010年左右有一个流行语，说没有人会这样做。是的，那是一个大问题。汽车和手机，确实是两样人们总会想办法支付的东西。

You know, my husband and I rented one of those, like, big fancy trucks, pickup trucks. And I was amazed by the amenities that are actually. Yeah, including, like, the heated seats I personalized heated, heavy heated what? Yeah. That's fancy. You know, it is very nice in the winter. Heated seats. We just talk about cars for, yeah, maybe a while longer. But the thing is, like, even for a car like that, I just. I cannot imagine spending like, $100,000 plus whatever the interest rate actually is on something like that. I remember that, meme from like, 2010 was like, no one will ever do. Yeah, that was a big thing. And the phone, it really was two things that people will always find a way to make a payment for the car and the phone, I forget. Right?

这就是为什么我认为你必须寻找一些结构性的转变。我怀疑这可能是因为有很多旧车可供选择。但最后一点，我认为**里卡德**说得很有趣，他说没有明显的灾难性催化剂。没有明显的迹象表明“哦，我们正处于消费者信贷崩溃的边缘”。但这只是一个压力稳步积累的故事，对吧？以至于如果出现某种火花或情况，就会产生很大的压力。

Which is why I think you have to look at something structural that's shifted. And I suspect maybe it's the availability of, you know, lots of older cars, but just, just one last point. It's I thought it was very interesting. Ricardo was saying it's like there's no obvious catalyst for classic cataclysms. There's not obvious like, oh, here is something we are on the verge of consumer credit collapse. But it is a story of just like steadily building pressure, right, such that if there is some sort of spark or something, there is a lot of stress, not, you know, the resumption of student loans after five years, the fact that the total loan price of the car has gotten so high relative to people's income, all of these different things see you like have all these upwards dresses on prices.

例如，学生贷款在五年后恢复偿还，汽车贷款总价相对于人们收入变得如此之高，所有这些不同的因素都给价格带来了上涨压力。你显然依赖于积累的财富，最显著的是股市和房屋净值。所以有很多事情汇聚在一起，它们不一定是灾难性的，但压力的汇合点并不在那里，情况可能会变得糟糕。对吧？消费者比以前脆弱得多。是的，可能比几年前脆弱得多。好的，我们就到此为止吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

You have all of this reliance, obviously, on accumulated wealth, most notably stock market and home equity. So you have a lot of things coming together that are not necessarily disaster or anything like that, but the, the, the alignment of pressures isn't there where things could potentially get bad. Right? The consumer is much more fragile. Yeah, than they used to be. They might have been a few years ago. Yeah. All right. Shall we leave it there. Let's leave it there.
