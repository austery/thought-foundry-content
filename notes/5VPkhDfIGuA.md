### 极端主义的吸引力与根源

**主持人**: 我们随处可见新闻头条，包括在安大略省这里。关于**新纳粹团体**、关于**伊斯兰国 (ISIS)** 招募人员的新闻。这些组织显然有不同的目标和**意识形态**，但它们是否会吸引那些有相似心理需求的人群？我们探讨了为什么极端主义团体可能吸引那些孤立的人，尤其是男性，以及我们如何更广泛地应对**孤独感**。欢迎来到‘The Rundown’。新纳粹团体、伊斯兰国、**QAnon**。它们可能看起来没什么共同点，但它们都承诺**联系**、**社区**和**目标**。这些东西今天是否供不应求？如果是这样，我们是否生活在一个越来越可能产生极端主义者的世界里？‘The Rundown’的制作人埃里克·邦比西诺将探讨这些问题以及更多关于极端主义的内容。研究员阿玛纳特·阿玛拉辛伽姆。

**Host**: We see the headlines everywhere, including here in Ontario. Headlines about Neo-Nazi groups, about ISIS recruits. These organizations obviously have different goals and ideologies, but do they appeal to certain kinds of people with similar psychological needs? We look at why extremist groups may appeal to those who are isolated, especially men, and at what we can do more broadly to combat loneliness. Welcome to The Rundown. Neo-Nazi groups, ISIS, QAnon. They may not seem to have much in common, but they all promise connection, community, purpose. Are those things in short supply today? And if so, are we living in a world that's more and more likely to produce extremists? 'The Rundown' producer Eric Bombicino tackles those questions and more with extremism. Researcher Amarnath Amarasingam.

**主持人**: 我想感谢令人愉快的阿玛纳特来到我们这个小小的、小小的地牢里。感谢你的到来。

**Host**: I want to thank the delightful Amarnath here for coming to hang out in our little our little dungeon here. Thanks for coming.

</details>

**阿玛纳特·阿玛拉辛伽姆**: 谢谢邀请我。很高兴回来。

**Amarnath Amarasingam**: Thanks for having me. It's good to be back.

**主持人**: 他是宗教学院的教授，并兼任**女王大学**政治学系的职务。所以我们今天将讨论所有关于极端主义的话题。但我想首先从最根本的问题开始，那就是为什么有人会收拾行李，飞往叙利亚为‘伊斯兰国’而战？为什么有人会加入一个极端主义团体？它的诱惑或吸引力是什么？它能提供给他们什么？所以让我们从那里开始。在理解极端主义的吸引力时，我们首先应该提出什么问题？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: He is a professor in the School of Religion and is cross-appointed to the Department of Political Studies at Queen's University. So we're going to talk all things extremism today. But the first thing I wanted to start with is I think at the tippy top for folks, which is why why would someone pack their bags, fly to Syria and fight for ISIS? Why would someone join an extremist group? What's the allure or the appeal? What does it offer them? So let's let's start there. What's the first thing we should put on the table when it comes to understanding the appeal of extremism?

</details>

**阿玛纳特·阿玛拉辛伽姆**: 嗯，我认为很多人都有不满之处。他们可能有经济上的不满、社会上的不满、文化上的不满，但并非所有这些都会立即转化为加入极端主义团体，甚至觉得这些团体有吸引力。我认为这就是**意识形态**发挥作用并做一些工作的地方。对吧？意识形态的作用是，它倾向于为你解读这些不满，以回答几个关键问题。你知道，我生活艰难或者我经济上、文化上遇到了什么事情，这很好。但谁该负责？我该怎么做？我个人需要做什么才能做对？所以，意识形态赋予了不满以意义、目标感和价值感。我认为，这在所有我们研究过的不同团体中都是基础，比如‘伊斯兰国’、‘基地组织’、以及极右翼。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Amarnath Amarasingam**: Well, I think a lot of people have grievances right there. They might have economic grievances, social grievances, cultural grievances, but not all of that will immediately translate to being part of an extremist group or even finding some of these groups attractive. I think that's where the ideology comes in and does a little bit of work. Right. The what ideology does is it tends to interpret grievances for you to show the to answer a few pivotal questions. You know, it's great that I'm struggling or something's happened to me economically, culturally. But who is responsible? What do I do about it and what's required of me personally to do it right, and so that it ideology gives grievance, sense of purpose, sense of meaning. And I think that that's kind of at the base of it across different groups that we've all looked at, you know, the Islamic State, al Qaeda, the far right.

</details>

**阿玛纳特·阿玛拉辛伽姆**: 所以，这种对**意义**的追寻是其中一个重要部分。这样说公平吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Amarnath Amarasingam**: So there is this quest for meaning that that is one big part of this. Is that fair to say?

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**阿玛纳特·阿玛拉辛伽姆**: 我是说，很多人都说在追寻意义，但这句话说得太多了，有时感觉它正在失去力量。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Amarnath Amarasingam**: I mean, a lot of people say quest for meaning, but it's been said so many times that it sometimes feels like it's losing.

</details>

**主持人**: 它意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: What does it mean?

</details>

**阿玛纳特·阿玛拉辛伽姆**: 是的，就像，但这对很多人来说是根本的驱动力。对吧？你可能会达到一个点，日常生活的事件无法回答你生活中更深层次的问题。而成为这些运动的一部分是非常令人兴奋的、革命性的、乌托邦式的。因此，它确实能给日常生活的枯燥注入一种**目标感**。对吧？但这必须基于你感受到的某种不满和损失。否则，它就无处可去。它必须基于这样的想法：要么我的族群文化被剥夺了，我的族群权利被剥夺了，我或我的团体、我的‘**内群体**’遭受了社会经济的损害。然后，所有这些都必须通过意识形态的解读，来推动人们加入这些运动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Amarnath Amarasingam**: Yeah, like but that is the fundamental driver for a lot of people. Right? I think it is. You get to a point where just everyday occurrences in life are aren't answering the more deeper questions in your life. And being part of these movements is very exciting, very revolutionary, very utopian. And so it does infuse kind of the boredom of everyday life with with a sense of purpose. Right. And that but that has to kind of be grounded in something that you're feeling in terms of grievances and loss. Otherwise it tends to go nowhere. It has to be based in this idea that either my people's culture has been taken away, my people's rights have been taken away, socioeconomic damage has been done to me and my group, my in-group. And then all of that has to be reinterpreted with, with the, with the, with the use of ideology to kind of push people into some of these movements.

</details>

**主持人**: 你还能获得一群朋友，你就能获得一个现成的**社区**。这是其中的一个重要部分吗？人们感到孤独，需要社区。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: You also get a bunch of buddies, you get you get a ready-made community. Is that is that a big part of this? People are feeling lonely and there's a need for community.

</details>

**阿玛纳特·阿玛拉辛伽姆**: 社区是巨大的。这可以发生在现实生活中，也可以发生在网上。我以前会观察一些‘伊斯兰国’的支持者在网络空间里的活动，人们总是倾向于认为网络社区不如现实生活社区重要。但观察它们一段时间后，你会发现，哦，他们愿意为彼此承担风险。他们互相寄钱。他们建立了友谊。所以，这种线上的联系感和线下的联系感一样真实。然而，即使是这种联系，有时也受到意识形态的调节，因为谁属于‘内群体’，谁是我社区的一部分，这取决于你是否同意我的观点。你属于‘内群体’还是不属于，对吧？我有一个朋友，她的儿子去了叙利亚和伊拉克，加入了‘伊斯兰国’，她曾讲过一个故事，说有一天他回家后会说：‘我再也不能用你们的餐具吃饭了，我再也不能用你们的盘子吃饭了，因为你们是那个被污染的、不信教的家庭的一部分。现在我属于被选中的、精英的、被拣选的。’所以，一旦你划定了‘我们’和‘他们’之间的界限，这就决定了你的社区是谁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Amarnath Amarasingam**: Community is huge. That can happen offline and online. I used to watch some of these ISIS supporters in the online space, and people always tended to dismiss the online community as less important than the real life community. And just watching them for a while, you tend to see that, oh, they're they're willing to take risks for each other. They're sending money to each other. They're doing they have friendships there. So that that sense of online bonding is just as real as the offline bonding. And even that, though, is sometimes mediated by ideology, because who who belongs in the in-group, who is part of my community, well, that's going to be determined by whether you agree with me or not. You're part of the in-group or not, right? There was a a friend of mine who's a son went off to fight in, in Syria and Iraq with the Islamic State, and she used to tell a story of how one day he would come home and say, I can no longer eat from utensils, I can no longer eat from your plates because you are part of the polluted, kind of non-believer family. Now I'm part of the elect, the elite, the selected, the chosen. And so once you create those boundaries between us and them that determines who your community is.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以，我认为可以说，世界正变得越来越令人眼花缭乱的复杂。灰色地带变得越来越灰，这会造成很多不确定性，会给人们带来焦虑。那么，极端主义在这种**非黑即白思维**中，是否是一种出路？这听起来可能有点奇怪，但极端主义是否能带来慰藉？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So I think it's fair to say the world's getting increasingly dizzyingly complex. The grey area is getting greyer and greyer, and that can create a lot of uncertainty, that can create anxiety for folks. So does extremism in that black and white thinking. Is that like a way out is extremism? And this may sound a little weird to say, but is extremism comforting?

</details>

**阿玛纳特·阿玛拉辛伽姆**: 我的意思是，我认为世界越复杂。你知道，德国社会学家**乌尔里希·贝克**曾称之为‘**风险社会**’，其理念是世界变得如此复杂，以至于我们甚至不知道这些风险的参数是什么，对吧？比如在中国武汉发生了一件事。突然之间，我在多伦多的孩子们就不能去上学了，对吧？当前的风险没有界限。一旦你把它放出来，就收不回来了。它会蔓延开来，包罗万象，你不知道原因是什么。在这种情况下，当一种意识形态或一群人出现并说：‘我知道这一切都是混乱，但让我来解释原因。’这很简单，对吧？就是‘你是好的，他们是坏的，是他们造成了这一切，你需要与他们斗争’，对吧？它能从混乱中创造意义，并赋予你目标感。这可能是。所以你可以从这种混乱中创造出‘内群体’。而**阴谋论**非常有用。意识形态也非常有用，因为它们是那些能够将混乱塑造成某种东西的工具，让你不再仅仅是受害者，而是能够采取行动。控制。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Amarnath Amarasingam**: I mean, I think the the more the world gets complicated. You know, German sociologist named Ulrich Beck used to call it the Risk society, which is the idea that the world is getting so complicated that we don't even know what the parameters of that of these risks are, right? Like something can happen in Wuhan, China. And all of a sudden my kids in Toronto aren't going to school, right? There are no boundaries to current risks. You once you let it out of the bag, it's not putting it back. And it kind of takes over and it's all encompassing and you don't know where the cause is. And so within that scenario, when an ideology or a group of people come in and say, we know this is all chaos, but actually let me explain why. It's very simple, right? It's you are good and these people are bad, and they're the ones who caused this, and they're the ones you need to fight, right? It creates a very meaning out of out of that chaos and gives you a sense of purpose out of that chaos. And so that could be. So you can create those kind of in-groups out of that chaos. And, and this is where conspiracy theories are very useful. And this is where ideology is very useful, because those are the ones those are the things that do the work of molding that chaos into something that you're not just a victim of, but now you're now you can do something about it. Control. Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。那么，在不确定性更大的时期，比如我们刚刚经历的三年大流行，你是否会看到阴谋论的兴起，这些坚定的信念来让你对某事感到确定？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. So would you. So in times where there is greater uncertainty, which we just went through one for about three years, the pandemic, will you see a rise in conspiracy theory, these firm handholds to feel certain about something?

</details>

**阿玛纳特·阿玛拉辛伽姆**: 是的，我认为是这样。我的意思是，我认为所有的阴谋论，所有与阴谋论相关的极端主义运动都源于某种形式的混乱。对。或者某种无法解释的事件。对吧？学者们称之为‘**比例性偏见**’，即当发生大事时，我们心理上会渴望一个与之匹配的重大原因。对。对吧？当，当，比如，美国总统被暗杀时，你会觉得，嗯，这只是一个在图书仓库里的家伙，这并不令人满意。是的。对吧？但说**CIA**在背后操纵，或者，你知道，**苏联**在背后操纵，或者别的什么，会更令人满意。同样的事情，类似的动态也发生在疫情期间，就像，哦，世界戛然而止，对吧？而你告诉我，是因为某个偏远地区的实验室实验？这说不通。对。所以实际上，我们需要一个‘人’。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Amarnath Amarasingam**: Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think all conspiracy theories, all conspiracy linked extremist movements come out of some form of chaos. Yeah. Or some some form of event that is, is beyond explanation. Right. And academics call this proportionality bias, which is like when big things happen, we kind of desire psychologically a big cause for those big things. Yeah. Right. And when, when, when like the, when president of the United States gets assassinated and you're like, well, it's just one guy in a book depository, that's not very satisfying. Yeah. Right. So but it's more satisfying to say the CIA was behind it or, you know, the USSR was behind it or whatever. And so that similar thing, similar dynamics happened with the pandemic, where it's just like, oh, the world came to a screeching halt, right? And you're telling me because it was some lab experiment in the middle of nowhere? That doesn't make sense. Right. And so actually, we need a man.

</details>

**主持人**: 那是混乱。那是混乱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: That's chaos. That's chaos.

</details>

**阿玛纳特·阿玛拉辛伽姆**: 我们需要一个更宏大、更庞大的解释来解释原因。或者解释这个事件。所以，有时你会出现阴谋论，因为那是天生的‘阴谋论思维’。对。并且说出谁在幕后操纵这一切，他们为什么这样做。总有一个‘影子精英’在制造混乱，在控制一切。你可能会想，嗯，这应该让我们更害怕，但实际上，至少你可以识别出来。是的，至少你可以识别出来。对。这让人们感到一种安慰，可以这样说：‘好吧，我知道谁在幕后，我知道他们为什么这样做，我知道我该做什么。我必须唤醒所有人，让他们了解真相。’对。这种思维模式是‘QAnon’运动背后的原因。这也是许多其他与疫情相关的阴谋论背后的原因。所以，这种‘锁定原因并参与其中’的做法，有时自然会导致极端主义运动，因为我总是说，并非所有的阴谋论都一样。并非所有的阴谋论都带有**道德成分**，以同样的方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Amarnath Amarasingam**: We need a massively bigger as big an explanation to explain explain the cause. And so I think or explain the event. And so out of that, sometimes you do have conspiracy because that's naturally conspiratorial thinking. Right. And to say who's behind all of this and why are they doing that. There's always this kind of shadowy elite who's who's out for chaos, who's controlling things. And you might think, well, that should make us more scared, but actually, at least you can identify. Yes, at least you can identify it. Right. And that that gives people a sense of comfort to say, okay, I know who's behind it, I know why they're behind it, and I know what I have to do. I have to wake everybody up to to the truth. Right. And so this kind of thinking was behind QAnon, the QAnon movement. This was behind a lot of the other pandemic related conspiracy theories and so on. So this kind of pinpointing a cause and getting involved, and sometimes that naturally leads to extremist kind of movements, because I always say not every conspiracy theory is the same. Not every conspiracy theory has a moral component to it, in the same way.

</details>

**主持人**: 几乎就像一个行动号召。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: As a call to action, almost.

</details>

**阿玛纳特·阿玛拉辛伽姆**: 作为行动号召。而‘QAnon’就非常适合这一点，对吧？比如好莱坞和民主党精英正在经营一个**秘密的恋童癖团伙**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Amarnath Amarasingam**: As a call to action. Whereas if I whereas QAnon was perfect for that, right? Where it's like Hollywood and the Democratic elite are, are are operating a clandestine pedophile ring.

</details>

**主持人**: 对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Right.

</details>

**阿玛纳特·阿玛拉辛伽姆**: 这和说‘地球是平的’或‘登月是假的’不一样，因为这个（恋童癖团伙）带有道德号召。你有。你告诉我孩子们被奴役和折磨？这会让我坐立不安。比‘登月是假的’或‘地球是平的’之类的可能性大得多，对吧？是的。所以，并非所有的阴谋论都能以同样的方式动员人们。我认为我们越来越多地看到，这些阴谋论的性质正在转向那些能够动员人心的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Amarnath Amarasingam**: It's not the same as saying the earth is flat or the moon landing was faked because this one has a moral call to action. You have. You're telling me kids are being enslaved and tortured? That's not that's going to get me out of my seat. Much more likely than the moon landing was faked or the Earth is flat or whatever, right? Yeah. So not all conspiracy theories can galvanize in the same way. And I think we've seen more and more the nature of those conspiracy theories shift to galvanize to those that are galvanizing.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的，我想问一个宏大而不公平的问题。它有点像我们在反复提及，但我觉得我们已经稍微触及了它，那就是我认为你和我已经讨论这个问题十多年了。我曾经是一个在‘Agenda’节目中紧张的年轻制作人。我曾打电话给你，我认为由联邦政府资助的‘**去激进化**’项目已经存在了十多年了。在这十年里，就这些条件而言，我们谈论的是对意义的需求、对目标的追求、孤独感、对社区的需求，我们现在是否生活在一个越来越可能创造和产生极端主义者的世界里？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Okay, so I wanted to ask a big and unfair question. And it's sort of looking at we've I think we've been nibbling at it a little bit, but it's that I think it's really been you and I have been talking about this for over a decade. I used to as a nervous young producer on the agenda. I would call you up, I think derailment programs funded by the federal government have been around for just over a decade now. In that sweep of ten years, in terms of those conditions, we're talking about the need for meaning, the need for purpose, loneliness, the need for community has have we are we now in a world that is more and more likely to create and produce extremists?

</details>

**阿玛纳特·阿玛拉辛伽姆**: 这是个好问题。这有点不公平。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Amarnath Amarasingam**: That's a good question. It is a bit of an unfair question.

</details>

**主持人**: 我，我是说，我公平地设置了这个问题，因为我认为这是公平的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I, I mean, I fairly set it up as I'm fair, which I think is fair.

</details>

**阿玛纳特·阿玛拉辛伽姆**: 我认为我们正处于一种境地。我的意思是，这在某种程度上是一种‘鸟瞰式’的视角，就像我一直在观察的这些运动一样，一些研究人员现在称之为‘**现代性的终结**’。‘现代性’意味着现代性已经走到了尽头。换句话说，现代性的承诺是，我们将让你成为中产阶级。你将拥有一栋带栅栏的漂亮房子、一辆车、一个妻子和一个孩子，一对妻子和孩子，一切都会很美好。这将是和平的。不会有战争。权力将和平转移。你将获得养老金。就像，这就是**自由主义现代性**的承诺，即我们将让你的生活摆脱混乱，对吧？但我想我们现在看到的是它的局限性，那就是‘风采’、目标感、意义感都消失了。所以，你会有很多人对‘带栅栏的房子’的故事感到满意。对。他们对此感到高兴。但也有一些人发现，这剥夺了生活的意义和价值，你需要超越它来找到自己的目标。对。所以，我认为当你问，我们是否处于一个可能产生更多极端主义运动的境地，当现代性的平静走到尽头，或者出现像大流行病那样刺破它的时刻，这扰乱了我们的‘常态感’，或者你现在在美国看到的一切，就像那些‘**墙纸**’一样。他们生活中的制度正在被侵蚀，人们意识到，哦，我以为我们不需要这些东西，因为自由主义现代性，它的作用是，它运行得非常顺畅。对吧？它很无聊，很官僚，很制度化。它会给你任何你想要的东西。而它的作用是，它在你周围创造了一种‘墙纸’，以至于你实际上不记得你需要这些东西，对吧？所以你开始认为这是理所当然的。你开始认为和平与宁静是理所当然的。你偶尔需要一个像**特朗普**那样的人物出现，说：‘让我暂时拿走你的医疗保健。让我，让我派军队和边境官员来，在你的日托中心出现，让我谈谈窃取选举之类的事情。’然后人们说，哦，‘墙纸’还在。哦，我们曾经认为理所当然的一切。哦，我们实际上需要所有这些，对吧？对。极端主义运动进入这种情景的方式是，它们会让你需要一个解释，为什么会出现新的混乱。对。所以极端主义团体将非常擅长向你解释这种混乱的来源，谁该为此负责，对吧？以及你该怎么做。所以，当那种和平的局面结束时，暴力和混乱的机会就出现了。而极端主义团体喜欢暴力和混乱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Amarnath Amarasingam**: I think I think we are at a situation. I mean, this is this is kind of very bird's eye in a way, like what I've been seeing across some of these movements is what some researchers now call like the the end of modernity. Meaning means like modernity has kind of run its course. In other words, the promise of modernity is we're we're going to you're going to be middle class. You're going to have a nice house with a picket fence and a car and a wife and a child, a wife and children, and everything's going to be great. It's going to be peaceful. There's not going to be any war. It's going to be peaceful, transfer of power. You're going to have a pension. Like like that was the promise of liberal modernity is to say, we're going to make your life chaos free, right? But what I think we're seeing now is the limits of that, which is the sense of the sense of flair, purpose, meaning is all lost. And so you're you have a lot of a lot of people are fine with the, with the, with the white picket fence story. Right. They're happy in it. But there are individuals who find that that strips life of purpose and meaning and that you need to kind of go beyond it to find a purpose for yourself. Right. And so that I think when you say, are we in a situation where you might create more extremist movements when that calmness of modernity runs its course, or there are moments that pierce it, like the pandemic, which which kind of upended our sense of normalcy or what you're seeing in the United States right now, which is all of the wallpaper. Institutions of their life are being eroded, and people are realizing that, oh, I thought we were we didn't need these things because liberal modernity, what it does, it functions very smoothly. Right? It's boring, it's bureaucratic, it's institutional. It'll give you whatever you want. And what it does is it it creates a kind of wallpaper around yourself, to the point where you don't actually remember that you need these things, right? And so you start to take it for granted. You start to take the the peace and serenity for granted. And you need a kind of Trump figure once in a while to be like, let me take away your healthcare for a bit. Let me, let me send in the military and border agents to come and just show up at your Day-care let me talk about stealing elections and stuff like that. And then people say, oh, the wallpaper lives. Oh, all that stuff we took for granted. Oh, we actually need all that, right? Right. And the way extremist movements come into that scenario is they'll you need an explanation for why there's renewed chaos in Y. Right. And so extremist groups will be very good at explaining to you where this chaos came from, who's to blame, right? And what you need to do about it. And so when, when that kind of peaceful setup ends you, there's an opportunity there for violence and chaos. And extremist groups love violence and chaos.

</details>

**主持人**: 我们正在谈论 **2026** 年。但让我们回到大约，我想，**86** 年前。这是来自**奥威尔**对一本名为《**我的奋斗 (Mein Kampf)**》的书的评论。我认为这是设置这个话题的一种奇怪方式。我认为它真正抓住了你正在谈论的要点。事实是，奥威尔写道，**希特勒**身上有某种深刻的吸引力。希特勒知道，人类不仅想要舒适、安全、短工作时间、卫生、节育，以及总的来说，常识。他们也，至少是间歇性地，想要斗争和自我牺牲，更不用说鼓声、旗帜和忠诚游行了。然而，它们可能就像经济理论一样。**法西斯主义**和**纳粹主义**在心理上比任何**享乐主义**的生命观都更健全。这是 85 年前说的，那么，**自由主义**的本质是否一直存在这种缺陷？这也许既是优点也是缺点，即自由主义并没有为你提供任何意义。它只是一个容器。它是一个让人们拥有**宗教自由**的容器。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: We're talking about 2026. But let's go back about, I guess, 86 years. This is from Orwell's review of a book called Mein Kampf. And I think it's a weird way of setting that up. I think it gets I think it really gets at what you're talking about here. So the fact is, Orwell writes that there is something deeply appealing about him. Hitler knows that human beings don't only want comfort, safety, short working hours, hygiene, birth control, and in general, common sense. They also, at least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice, not to mention drums, flags and loyalty parades. However, they may be as economic theories. Fascism and Nazism are psychologically far sounder than any hedonistic conception of life. This was 85 years ago, so is there always been this kind of defect at the heart of liberalism? That's maybe both a strength and a weakness, where liberalism doesn't come packaged with any meaning for you. It is a container. It's a container for people to have freedom of religion in.

</details>

**阿玛纳特·阿玛拉辛伽姆**: 是的，我忘了是谁说的了，但有句话是：“自由主义会告诉你如何生活，但它不会告诉你你为什么而活。”我认为，这句引语也触及了核心。对吧？就像，是的，如果你对‘常态’感到满意，自由主义会给你‘常态’。但偶尔，如果你需要盛大的场面，如果你需要一位魅力四射的领导人，如果你需要有人在讲台上‘发号施令’，自由主义就不会这样做。它会让你在几十年里和平地、非常无聊地转移权力，并确保没有人侵犯你，你知道，它会让你过得安宁而平静。但有些人，我现在在电视上听到他们，在特朗普政府时期，在世界其他地方也是如此，他们渴望一种能打破这种沉闷、触动你灵魂的魅力四射的领导人，这种方式比仅仅是制度化的沉闷要强。是的，对。即使一切都非常和平、安静和稳定，偶尔，你们这些人也会在非混乱中茁壮成长，而是在比他们自身更伟大的事物中茁壮成长，以感受作为‘人’的感觉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Amarnath Amarasingam**: Yeah, I forget who said this, but the was something like liberalism will tell you how to live, but it doesn't tell you what you're living for. And that, I think, is at the heart of that quote too. Right? It's like, yeah, if you're happy with normalcy, liberalism will give you normalcy. But once in a while, if you need the pageantry, if you need the charismatic leader, if you need someone hitting the shoot at the podium, that's not what liberalism will do. It'll give you the peaceful transfer of very boring power over decades and make sure that no one invades you and you know, and it'll be nice and quiet. But there there are people. And I've heard them on TV now with the Trump administration, with the with in other parts of the world, too, where there is a thirst for kind of a charismatic leader who bursts through that boredom and gives you some kind of touches your spirit in a way that that's more than just this kind of institutional boredom. Yeah, right. Even if it's very peaceful and things are quiet and stable once in a while, you people thrive on not chaos, but something greater than themselves to feel like they're feel like they're human.

</details>

**主持人**: 好吧，关于自由主义还有一个问题。我保证之后就没了。是的，我认为我们开始看到政治对人们来说变得有点宗教化了。政治即宗教。总的来说，自由主义是否需要宗教，来满足对意义的需求，而又不至于变成‘政治即宗教’？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right, one more question on liberalism. I promise no more after this. Yeah, I think we're starting to see politics becoming a little bit religious for people. Politics as religion. Does liberalism need religion in general, that that contains that need for meaning without it becoming politics as religion?

</details>

**阿玛纳特·阿玛拉辛伽姆**: 我的意思是，自由主义不需要宗教，但它有时倾向于创造‘**公民宗教**’，对吧？所以，再次，再提几个名字。**罗伯特·贝拉**曾写过一篇非常重要的文章，题为‘公民宗教’，他说美国，尽管它自称不是一个宗教国家，比如一个国家，一个宗教国家，宗教自由等等，但它的爱国主义确实有很多宗教般的特质，对吧？货币上有‘我们信仰上帝’的字样。有国旗，有 21 响礼炮，有宪法中对第二修正案的‘崇拜’等等。它有一种‘公民宗教’的成分，而美国政治的实践本身就是一种宗教冲动。对。我不知道其他国家是否真的有这种东西，除了印度可能存在的‘**印度教民族主义**’，或者一些地方已经将这些融合在一起。但美国在这方面一直很特别，那就是他们对自己‘建国’的承诺。你知道，他们谈论‘建国先辈’或‘建国文献’的方式。那里有一种对世俗人物的敬畏，这在其他国家有时是复制不了的。所以，这种情况有时会发生在自由主义中，即国家本身被神圣化，但它不一定需要宗教，除非发生那种情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Amarnath Amarasingam**: I mean, liberalism doesn't need religion, but what it tends to do sometimes is create civil religion, right? And so again, name drop some more. Robert Bellah wrote this very important article back in the when ever it was called Civil Religion, where he says America, even though it presumes to not be a religious country, like a, like a state, religious country, religious freedom, etc. does have a lot of religious qualities to its patriotism, right? There's a 'In God we trust' on the currency. There's a flags, there's 21 gun salutes, there's the, the, the worship of the Second Amendment in the Constitution and all of these things. There's a kind of civil, religious component to it, which the practice of politics in the United States is itself a kind of religious impulse. Right. And I don't know that any other country really has that, except maybe like Hindu nationalism in India or where where some of that has been fused together. But the US has always been kind of peculiar for that, which is the kind of commitment that they have to their own founding. You know, the way they talk about their founding fathers or the founding documents. And it's a kind of reverence there which to to secular figures that doesn't sometimes get replicated in other countries. So that can happen sometimes with, with liberalism, where the kind of state itself is sacralized, but it doesn't necessarily require like religion unless unless that kind of thing happens.

**主持人**: 加拿大不与我们的建国历史建立这种联系，这对加拿大是好事吗？因为我认识一些人会说，他们希望我们与这段历史有更多的联系。他们希望我们更扎根于那段历史。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Is it good in Canada that we don't have that relationship with our founding in past? Because there are some people I know that would be like, they want us to have more of that relationship. They want us to be more rooted in that history.

</details>

**阿玛纳特·阿玛拉辛伽姆**: 嗯，这就是挑战，对吧？我们是一个**多元文化**、多元主义的社会。每当政治领导人被问及加拿大的身份是什么时，他们都会说我们的**加拿大身份**是多元文化主义。这对一些人来说很好，比如我，我在多元文化主义的鼎盛时期来到这里。但如果你是‘**本土主义**’导向的，如果你，你知道，如果你再次有这些不满，那么加拿大正在消失，正在被剥夺，这就不够好了，对吧？多元主义作为一种身份认同是不够的，因为它没有给你一种‘真相’感。有 100 个人相信 100 件不同的事情。你。而你说我应该在多样性中找到价值。那么，我曾经认为加拿大代表的是什么呢？它正在消失，人们没有同化，他们把自己的世界观带了进来。有些东西正在被侵蚀，我们需要重新夺回它。对。所以这可能导致。我认为我们正在看到一些本土主义团体或极右翼团体对多元主义和多元文化主义，或者围绕它们的缺乏成熟度的反应，即加拿大身份的核心有些东西正在丢失。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Amarnath Amarasingam**: Well, this is the challenge, right? Is like we're a multicultural, pluralist society. And whenever political leaders are asked what our Canadian identity is, they say our Canadian identity is multiculturalism. And that's great for some people who, like me, who arrived here during during the height of multiculturalism. But if you're kind of nativist oriented, if you're, you know, if you, again, have these grievances, that's something about Canada's being disappeared and taken away from you. That's not good enough. Right? Pluralism as an identity isn't good enough because because it's not giving you a sense of truth. It's 100 people who believe 100 different things. You're. And you're saying I should find value in that diversity. Well, what about, like, what I thought Canada stood for? And it's disappearing and people aren't assimilating and they're bringing their world views in here. Something's being eroded and we need to reclaim it. Right. And so it can lead. I think we're seeing a reaction to pluralism and multiculturalism or the lack of sophistication around it from some of these more nativist groups or far right groups that, that that there's something at the core of Canadian identity which is being lost.

### 社会疏离、心理健康与激进化

**主持人 (丹)**: 显然，这场对话还没有结束。下周请继续收听我们与阿玛纳特·阿玛拉辛伽姆的第二部分讨论。届时我们将讨论一种令研究人员困惑的新型极端主义。孤独感会为**激进化**创造肥沃的土壤。总的来说，它会对身心健康产生严重影响。一种叫做**社会处方**的东西能否提供部分答案？让我们深入探讨它是什么以及它如何能增强**社会联系**。凯特·穆里根是**达拉·拉纳公共卫生学院**的副教授，也是**加拿大社会处方研究所**的创始科学主任。凯特，很高兴你能来节目。你怎么样？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Dan)**: Obviously, that conversation is not over. Tune in next week for part two of our discussion with Amarnath Amarasingam. When we talk about a new form of extremism that's baffling researchers. Loneliness can create fertile ground for radicalization. And just generally, it can have serious effects on mental and physical health. Could something called social prescribing hold part of the answer? Let's dig into what that is and how it could boost social connection. Kate Mulligan is an associate professor at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health, and the founding scientific director of the Canadian Institute for Social Prescribing. Kate, great to have you on the program. How are you doing?

</details>

**凯特·穆里根**: 非常感谢，丹。我做得很好。你呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kate Mulligan**: Thanks so much, Dan. I'm doing really well. How are you?

</details>

**主持人 (丹)**: 我做得很好。让我们来谈谈关于**孤独感**的数据。在加拿大，它显示了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Dan)**: I'm doing great. Let's talk about the data that talks about loneliness. What does it show here in Canada?

</details>

**凯特·穆里根**: 嗯，至少有五分之一的加拿大人正在经历孤独感，四分之一的人正在经历**精神疾病**或**心理健康挑战**。有时这些可能高度相关。对于年轻人来说，发病率高于平均水平。我们知道，这部分原因在于他们正处于人生的一个非常重要的形成时期，有很多变化正在发生，但同时也是当今世界一个形成和变化中的时期，充满了不确定性和对他们现在及未来角色的迷茫。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kate Mulligan**: Well, at least 1 in 5 Canadians is experiencing loneliness and 1 in 4 is is experiencing mental illness or mental health challenges. And sometimes those can be really correlated. For young people, the rates are higher than average. And we know that that's partly because they're at a really formative time in their lives, with much change going on, but also a formative and changing time in the world right now, with a lot of precarity and a lot of uncertainty about what their roles are now and what they might be in the future.

</details>

**主持人 (丹)**: 我想深入探讨一下它的人口统计学特征。我们经常听到关于孤独感流行病特别影响年轻男性的说法，我们是更有可能感到孤独的男性吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Dan)**: I want to dig a little bit into the demographics of it. We hear a lot about loneliness epidemic affecting young men specifically, are we more likely to be lonely men?

</details>

**凯特·穆里根**: 不。现实情况是，年轻女性和年轻男性都在经历**社会孤立**和孤独感。事实上，更多的年轻女性正在经历**焦虑**和**抑郁**。但这些经历的后果因性别而异，年轻女性仍然更有可能从医疗系统中寻求社会支持或健康帮助，而年轻男性则不太可能这样做。我们还知道，男性更有可能将这些经历转化为物质滥用、暴力，甚至自杀，在加拿大的自杀事件中，约有 75% 是男性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kate Mulligan**: No. The reality is that young women and young men are both experiencing social isolation and loneliness. And in fact, many more young women are experiencing anxiety and depression. But the consequences of those experiences are quite different by gender, so young women are still more likely to seek social support or health help from health systems, whereas young men are less likely to do so. And we also know that men are more likely to channel some of these experiences into things like substance use, violence, and even suicide completion, which is at about 75% of suicides in Canada, are from from men.

</details>

**主持人 (丹)**: 让我们，你在之前的回答中稍微提到了这一点。你提到的导致他们孤独的特定原因是什么？我的意思是，如果我们看看过去几年，我们可以指出一些原因。但是的，让我们来分析一下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Dan)**: Let's you alluded to it a little bit in your previous answer. Are there particular causes for their loneliness you had mentioned? I mean, there's a lot of if we look at sort of the last couple of years, we can point to a few things. But yeah, let's break it down.

</details>

**凯特·穆里根**: 是的。所以孤独感不是个人的失败。这是一个政策问题。它源于我们在这个世界上为自己创造的结构。在新冠疫情之前，我很难将孤独感、社会脱节和缺乏社会凝聚力视为健康问题，而在疫情期间，我们都亲身体验了在更孤立的环境中生活的感受，而且作为一个社会，我们尚未完全恢复到疫情前的社会参与和互动水平。当然，这只是其中一个驱动因素。我们不再拥有像过去那样在信仰团体或服务俱乐部等方面的社区参与和支持水平。年轻人的屏幕使用时间大大增加，他们也越来越多地转向**AI聊天机器人**等工具，而不是向其他人寻求心理健康和社会挑战的帮助。所以这种情况似乎在加速。有许多不同的原因和诱因，但所有这些背后最重要的潜在因素之一是，这些年轻人以及许多其他年龄段的人都有一种‘我们不重要’的感觉。例如，我们在加拿大的医疗保健系统中可以看到这一点，当我们去预约时，我们可能会觉得我们可能在‘打扰’，或者我们认为我们可能有什么需求，因为我们知道我们的医疗系统多么紧张和压力重重，而且这是我们共同面临的问题。但这加起来就是一种‘官僚冷漠’，确实对我们产生了巨大影响。而对于年轻人，尤其是处于人生形成期的年轻男性，他们希望感到自己很重要。他们希望感到自己对社会有所贡献。他们希望感到自己有能力掌控自己的生活，有独立性，有能够为自己带来改变的选择。这些都是我们需要改变我们对这些年轻人（包括年轻男性）的结构性支持的潜在原因，让他们拥有归属感和价值感。再次。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kate Mulligan**: Yeah. So loneliness is it's not an individual failing. It's a policy problem. And it comes from the structures that we've created for ourselves in this world. It used to be a bit of a tough sell for me to talk about loneliness and social disconnection and lack of social cohesion as health issues prior to Covid and then during the pandemic, we all experienced for ourselves what it is like to really live in more socially isolated circumstances, and we've still never really fully recovered as a society in terms of the level of social participation and interaction that we had prior to that time. And of course, that's only just one of the drivers. We don't have the same levels of community engagement and support that we once had in things like faith communities or service clubs. We have a lot more use of screen time by young people, who are also increasingly turning to things like AI chatbots instead of other humans for help with their mental health and social challenges. So it seems to be accelerating. There are a number of different reasons and causes, but really one of the most important underlying factors beneath all of those is the feeling amongst those young people and many people of other ages as well, that we don't matter. And we see this in Canadian health care systems, for example, when we sort of feel like maybe we're imposing when we go for an appointment or we think we might have something of a need because we know how strained and stressed our health system is and that it's something shared between us. But that adds up to a level of sort of bureaucratic indifference that really, really impacts us. And for young people, young men at that formative time in their lives, they want to feel that they matter. They want to feel that they're making a contribution to the to this society. They want to feel that they have some competence and mastery over their own lives and some independence and some choices that are going to make a difference for themselves. Those are those underlying reasons that we need to change some of our structural supports for these young people, including young men, to give them a place of belonging and mattering. Again.

</details>

**主持人 (丹)**: 说到这里，我想从公共卫生的角度来看。人们未能维持亲密联系和关系，这对社会造成了怎样的伤害？‘**涓滴效应**’看起来是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Dan)**: With that, I want to put the public health lens on here. How are people's failures to maintain close connections, relationships hurting society? What is the trickle down effect look like?

</details>

**凯特·穆里根**: 我认为有几点。首先，医疗保健成本增加。所以我们开始去看医生，因为我们缺乏其他地方来表达我们的社会需求。我们去看医生也是因为我们的社会需求正在通过我们的身体表现出来。所以我们有更高的**全因死亡率**，所有死亡原因都与长期的、日益增长的孤独感和社会脱节有关，因为我们是生物体。我们天生就应该与他人在一起。正如我提到的，我们患有精神疾病的几率更高，但患有身体健康挑战、心脏病、中风的几率也更高。许多类型的脑部疾病，以及其他由这种孤独感引起或加剧的挑战。所以它体现在我们的身体上，体现在我们的医疗系统中，我们可以治疗它，并且可以在其他地方更有效地预防它。它也体现在我们缺乏‘**能动性**’，即我们作为邻居，在我们自己的社区，在我们自己的社会中照顾彼此的能力，我们不必依赖大型外部机构来获得那些曾经存在于社区中的基本支持。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kate Mulligan**: I think there are a few things. I mean, one, there are increased health care costs. So we start going to our health care providers because we lack other places to go to express our social needs. We also go because our social needs are being literally expressed in our bodies. So we have higher rates of all cause mortality, all reasons for death that are that because of extended and growing loneliness and social disconnection, we're biological creatures. We are meant to be around other people. We have higher rates of these mental health disorders, as I've mentioned, but also higher rates of physical health challenges, heart attack, stroke. Many kinds of brain disorders, and other challenges that are either caused or exacerbated by this loneliness. So it's showing up in our bodies, it's showing up in our health systems, and we can treat it, and we can prevent it much more effectively in other places. It's also showing up in our lack of sense of agency that we can take care of one another as neighbours, in our own communities, in our own societies, that we don't need to rely on big external institutions for some of those basic supports that used to just be in community.

</details>

**主持人 (丹)**: 好吧，让我们来谈谈其中一些支持。你是加拿大社会处方研究所的创始科学主任。你做什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Dan)**: Well, let's talk about some of those supports. You are the founding scientific director of the Canadian Institute for Social Prescribing. What do you do?

</details>

**凯特·穆里根**: 嗯，我寻找那些将医疗保健和社会问题联系起来的良好实践，并试图将它们发掘出来，在全国乃至全世界分享，使它们成为我们常规医疗保健系统和政府常规实践的一部分。到目前为止，看到‘社会处方’在全国范围内的发展真是令人惊叹。我们在 2018 年和 2019 年在安大略省的 11 个社区卫生中心启动了一个试点项目。现在，‘社会处方’正在全国每个省份实施，通常由政府资助，但并非总是如此。我工作的一个重要部分是帮助建立证据基础，帮助那些创新者找到彼此，并帮助他们的故事被记录下来，以便我们能够将‘社会处方’纳入我们常规的医疗保健系统。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kate Mulligan**: Well, I look for good practices where people are connecting these health care and social issues, and I try to surface them and share them around the country and the world to make them part of our regular health care system and our regular government practice. And so far, it's been amazing to see the growth of social prescribing all across the country. We started with a pilot project in 11 community health centres all across Ontario back in 2018 and 2019. We now have social prescribing happening in every single province across the country, often government funded, but not always so. A big part of what I'm doing is helping to build the evidence base, helping those innovators to find one another and helping to get their story on the record so that we can make this a regular part of our health system.

</details>

**主持人 (丹)**: 我们正在进行的对话之一，尤其是在本期节目中，是关于孤独感与激进化、极端主义之间的联系。我很好奇，它能否帮助预防激进化？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host (Dan)**: One of the conversations that we're having, especially on this episode, is sort of the connection from loneliness to radicalization, extremism. I'm curious, could it help prevent radicalization?

</details>

**凯特·穆里根**: 嗯，我认为是的，可以。所以，我们在‘社会处方’中关注的一些事情是，再次，进行干预，让人们感到自己很重要，而对年轻人进行干预意味着一生的预防。对吧？我们可以‘向上游’进行干预，帮助年轻男性保持对社区的参与、对工作的投入以及对自己健康和关怀的认知，从而节省数百万美元的上游医疗成本，同时也增加社会和经济参与，成为日常生活的一部分，这实际上是这一切的基础，它真正在于让人们重新融入社区，这样我们才能接触到他们，你知道，年轻男性会感到‘不重要’。他们将有两个选择。他们可以听取这种充满希望的、面对面的、实践性的愿景，或者他们可以听从算法的指引，走向一条更黑暗的道路，但这条道路也为他们提供了‘能动感’和‘归属感’。以及我一直在谈论的许多相同因素。所以我们确实需要干预。我们可以更早地进行干预，并且在全省和全国有许多很好的例子。例如，在**斯特吉恩湖**，有针对年轻**原住民男性**的项目，让他们尽早重新连接到文化上适当的‘**男子气概**’、身份和遗产，并与他们的文化建立联系。我们在全省都有以黑人社群为中心的‘社会处方’项目，帮助年轻的黑人男性以及黑人社区的其他成员运用‘**非洲中心原则**’来支撑他们的集体和个人健康。全省还有许多其他例子正在发生，但我们真正需要做的是将它们编织成一个更系统的整体，而这正是我们现在正在努力的方向。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kate Mulligan**: Well, I do think so, yes. So some of the things that we focus on in social prescribing are around, again, intervening so that people feel that they matter, and intervening for young people means a lifetime of prevention. Right. We can intervene upstream and help young men stay engaged in their communities, in their employment and in their own sense of health and care, saving millions of dollars in those upstream health costs, but also increased social and economic participation, being part of everyday life, which is really underlying all of this, what it's really about getting people back engaged into community so we can get to them, you know, younger men feeling that sense of not mattering. They're going to have two options. They can hear from this hopeful, in-person, hands-on vision, or they can hear from the algorithm that takes them to a much darker path, but also offers them a sense of agency and a sense of belonging. And many of those same factors that I've been talking about. So we do need to intervene. We can intervene earlier, and there are many good examples of this happening all across the province and the country. So in Sturgeon Lake, for example, there are programs for young indigenous men to reconnect with culturally appropriate sense of masculinity and identity and heritage early on to connect with their culture. We've got black focused social prescribing programs across the province that are helping young black men, and other members of the black community use Afrocentric principles to underpin their collective and individual health. Many other examples are happening all across the province, but what we really need to do is knit those together into more of a system, and that's what we're on our way to doing now.
