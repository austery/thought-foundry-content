### 真人秀的持久魅力

《摩门妻子们的秘密生活》、《爱岛》、《几乎所有你听过的城市的真人家庭主妇》等等。在真人秀（**Reality TV**: A genre of television programming that documents unscripted situations.）这一类型真正兴起三十多年后，它依然比以往任何时候都更加强大。那么，究竟是什么让真人秀节目让我们欲罢不能，一再回归呢？

<details>

<p class="english-text">There's The Secret Lives of Mormon wives, Love Island, The Real Housewives of practically every city you've ever heard of. More than 30 years after the reality TV genre really got going, it's stronger than ever. So, what is it about reality TV that keeps us coming back for more?</p>
</details>

我采访了 Proper Television 的联合总裁 Kathy James，她也是《加拿大厨神》等节目的执行制片人和节目总监；以及《The Thai》的副编辑 Sarah Cresell。我们探讨了在现实生活难以应对时，如何在真人秀中寻找逃避的出口。

<p class="english-text">I talked to Kathy James, co-president of Proper Television, executive producer and showrunner of Master Chef Canada, among other shows, and Sarah Cresell, associate editor at The Thai, about finding escape in reality TV when reality itself is hard to handle.</p>
</details>

>> Kathy，Sarah，欢迎来到节目。你们感觉怎么样？

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Kathy, Sarah, welcome to the program. How are you guys doing?</p>
</details>

>> 很好。非常感谢邀请我们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Great. Thank you so much for having us.</p>
</details>

>> 谢谢。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Thank you.</p>
</details>

>> 两种类型的娱乐观看正在兴起：真人秀，以及怀旧电视和电影。我想先从真人秀开始。Kathy，你认为人们在观看，可能在我看来是“ binge-watching”（沉迷观看）真人秀时，在寻找什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> There are two types of entertainment watching that's on the rise. reality TV and then we have nostalgia TV and films. I want to start with reality first. Kathy, what do you think people are looking for when they are watching perhaps binging in my case reality TV?</p>
</details>

>> 我不确定真人秀是否真的在兴起。我认为它已经是一个拥有 25 年历史的类型了，而且它已经存在了。我甚至不认为它一定很受欢迎。我认为它已经根植于娱乐界和我们的文化中，但确实有一些节目做得极其出色，并且处于时代精神（**Zeitgeist**: The defining spirit or mood of a particular period of history as shown by the ideas and beliefs of the time.）之中。我明白你是其中一个节目的粉丝。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Um, well, I don't know actually that reality TV is on the rise. I think that it is a a like a 25 year old genre now and that it's had it it I think that I don't even think of it necessarily as popular. I think of it as entrenched in the entertainment world and in our culture, but there's certainly certain shows that are doing extremely well and are in the zeitgeist. And I understand that you're a fan of one of those.</p>
</details>

>> 我是《日落豪宅》（Selling Sunset）的粉丝。[笑声] 承认了。也在看。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I am selling sunset. [laughter] Guilty. Also watching.</p>
</details>

>> 好的，很好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Okay, good.</p>
</details>

>> 我也承认。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Also guilty.</p>
</details>

>> 那么，我们在看这些节目时，到底在寻找什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, what are we looking for when we're we're watching these shows?</p>
</details>

>> 我认为每个人都在寻找不同的东西。我认为我作为一个制作人，观看它的方式可能与你们两人观看它的方式略有不同。所以，我想把话题转回给你们。因为作为制作人，我真的很想听听你们喜欢它的什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think that everybody's looking for something different. Um, I think the way that I might watch it as a producer of of um unscripted television (<strong>Unscripted television</strong>: Television programming that is not scripted, though it may be heavily produced or edited.) might be a little differently different than the way that that you two watch it. Um, so I'd like to turn it back to you two. Like I cuz as the producer it's really interesting for me to hear what you like about it.</p>
</details>

>> 好的。Sarah，你写了一篇关于你沉迷《日落豪宅》的文章，你说：“最重要的是，它那奢华的（<strong>Opulence</strong>: Great wealth and luxuriousness.）铺张浪费淹没了许多让我不适地面对我周围现实生活中的贫富差距的时刻。”我希望你能带我们回顾一下你的《日落豪宅》追剧历程，这似乎是一段从爱到可能有点爱恨交织的关系。对于不熟悉《日落豪宅》的人来说，它是什么样的节目？然后带我们走过你的追剧过程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Okay. Well Sarah you had written an article about your selling sunset habit and you wrote more than anything it's outsiz opulence drowns out the many moments when I'm uncomfortably confronted with the real life wealth disparities all around me. I'm hoping you could take us through sort of your selling sunset journey because it was sort of a a love maybe a love love relationship but sort of turns into a lovehate relationship. So for people who aren't familiar with Selling Sunset, what is the show and then walk us through your journey.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，《日落豪宅》是一种有点“软脚本”的“纪实肥皂剧”（<strong>Docu-soap</strong>: A hybrid genre combining elements of documentary and soap opera.）系列。它讲述的是房地产经纪人的故事，她们穿着华丽的服装，随着季度的推进，服装也越来越华丽。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, so Selling Sunset is kind of a softly scripted uh docu Soap series. Um it follows real estate agents who dress up in glamorous outfits, increasingly glamorous as the seasons go on.</p>
</details>

>> 星期二是 Met Gala（纽约大都会艺术博物馆慈善晚会）级别的着装。是的，说清楚点。是的。[笑声] 完全正确。这也是乐趣的一部分，对吧？嗯，是的，她们偶尔会卖房子，但我觉得，你知道，你不可能五分钟不看到 Chriselle 和 Emma 坐在价值数百万美元的豪宅边缘，谈论发生在“Girls Giving”（节目中的一个活动）的事情，而这些正是我期待的时刻。嗯，是的，我和《日落豪宅》的这段旅程，它确实是一段旅程。我记得我发短信给朋友说：“我开始了《日落豪宅》的追剧之旅”，因为它的受欢迎程度在疫情期间真正爆发了，它最早是在 2019 年发布的。嗯，是的，我在看《日落豪宅》时，基本上处于两种状态之一：要么是完全沉浸在剧情、心理分析和那些有趣的尴尬时刻中，要么就是我当时正经历一些事情，想彻底关掉大脑。嗯，我认为让我感觉幻想破灭的时刻是今年早些时候，一月份，推出了一部新的衍生剧，叫做《Selling the City》，背景设定在纽约市。我不知道，我有点认出了纽约市的暴露管道、支撑物和混凝土丛林，这和我自己所在的城市多伦多很像。我开始感觉自己有点脚踏实地了。是的，幻想不再那么奏效了。我开始想起，你知道，住房负担能力问题、无家可归者危机，以及人们无法支付房租和购买食品的问题。所以，这些人离我们并不遥远。他们就在我们身边。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Tuesday is the Metball for that. Yes, let's be very clear. Yes, [laughter] absolutely. And and that's part of the fun, right? Um and yeah, they kind of just they sell houses once in a while, but I think, you know, you can't go five minutes without uh Cricelle and Emma sitting on the edge of a multi-million dollar mansion and talking about what happened at Girls Giving, which are the moments that I'm waiting for. Um and yeah, my journey with with Selling Sunset, it truly was a journey. I remember texting friends being like, I have started the selling sunset journey because its popularity really exploded um during the pandemic because it first released in 2019. Um and yeah, I I was kind of in one of two states while watching Selling Sunset. I was either, you know, entrenched into the drama and into the psychoanalyses and into the funny awkward moments or, you know, I was going through it and looking to absolutely turn my brain off. Um, I think the moment that the fantasy sort of shattered a little bit for me was earlier this year in January, a new spin-off came out, which was Selling the City, which takes place in New York City. And I don't know, I kind of recognized, you know, the the exposed pipe and the and the pylons and the concrete jungle of New York City in in my own city of Toronto. And I I started to just feel like I was coming down to earth a little bit again. and and yeah, the fantasy wasn't wasn't so much working anymore. And I kind of remembered, you know, all the the issues of of housing unaffordability and the homelessness crisis and, you know, people's inability to pay rent and buy groceries. So, these people aren't that far off from us. They're they're they're around us.</p>
</details>

>> 有些人会谈论电视真人秀作为一种逃避现实（**Escapism**: The tendency to seek distraction and relief from unpleasant realities, especially by engaging in fantasy.）的方式，他们可能会认为这有点懒惰，是一种“罪恶的快乐”。但如今，还有一个词叫做“烂日”（Rot Day）。那是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Some [laughter] people will talk about uh unscripted TV reality shows as a form of escapism and they may make some associations that it is you know perhaps a bit lazy uh some guilty pleasure watching uh but these days there's also this term of rot day.</p>
</details>

>> 好的，“烂日”基本上就是当你允许自己尽可能长时间地“横躺”着。你可以毫无愧疚地 binge（沉迷）任意数量的剧集。嗯，你知道，喝你最喜欢的巧克力热饮或茶，或者任何你想要的东西。嗯，然后就是休息，并拥抱一种如今被认为是“激进”的休息方式。嗯，你知道，我认为这是 Z 世代的方式。这种趋势反映了我们对“奋斗文化”（<strong>Hustle Culture</strong>: A lifestyle and mindset that prioritizes constant work and productivity.）和“生产力文化”的集体拒绝。嗯，尤其是在我们应对“晚期资本主义”（<strong>Late-stage capitalism</strong>: A concept suggesting that capitalism is in its final phase, characterized by extreme inequality and exploitation.）的症状，以及因无意义的工作而筋疲力尽，并日益孤立于我们个人的生活方式——比如在家工作、完善健身习惯、观看我们喜欢的电视节目，然后上床睡觉，日复一日。我认为这反映了我们这一代人缺乏社区感，缺乏目标感和成就感。这并非对所有人而言。“烂日”是美好的、健康的、必要的。嗯，但是的，我认为有时它反映了一个更大的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Okay, so the rot day is basically when you are absolutely allowing yourself to be horizontal as long as you need to be. Binge as many episodes guilt-free as you need to. Um, you know, have your favorite hot chocolate or tea or whatever it is you want. Um, and just and and kind of rest and lean into um a level of rest that is considered radical these days. Um, you know, I think this is Gen Z's way. This trend is a reflection of our greater collective rejection against hustle culture and productivity culture. Um especially in a time when we're dealing with symptoms of you know latestage capitalism and and being exhausted from meaningless jobs and and being increasingly isolated in our individual lifestyles of you know working from home and perfecting our gym routine and watching our little prestige television show and then going to bed and doing it over and over again. And I think it's kind of a reflection of um our our lack of community and our lack of uh of touch with purpose and fulfillment in in our generation. That's not for everybody. Rot days are beautiful and and healthy and and necessary. Um but yeah, I think it's a reflection of of a greater problem sometimes.</p>
</details>

Kevin，我想听听你的看法，因为你提到了，你制作这类电视节目，不是《日落豪宅》，而是像《加拿大烘焙大赛》（The Great Canadian Bake Show）、《加拿大厨神》（Master Chef Canada），我们还有《Listing Large》，这是一个房地产节目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kevin, I want your take on this as as someone who as you mentioned who makes this television, not selling Senset, but you know, if we're mentioning shows, The Great Canadian Bake Show, Master Chef Canada, we've got Listing Large, which is a real estate show.</p>
</details>

>> 听了 Sarah 的话，你制作这些节目时，是否会考虑这些因素？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Listening to uh what Sarah has to say, does that is that something that is in your brain thinking about when you're producing some of these shows?</p>
</details>

>> 嗯，我肯定想创造一种愉快的体验。我认为，无论是阅读还是电影，所有娱乐都是一种逃避。你知道，在 19 世纪，人们因为读太多书而被责骂。而现在，你想想“烂日”，你只是沉浸在更多的“烂”中，因为真人秀、数字文化、好奇心和抱负的循环贯穿了整个文化。当你沉浸在《日落豪宅》中时，你并没有逃避它。你实际上是在拥抱它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Um, well, I I definitely I I definitely want to create an enjoyable experience. I think that, you know, all entertainment, whether it's reading or movies, is a form of escape. You know, in the 19th century, people were scolded for reading too much. And now, you know, it's interesting to think of a rot where really you're just immersing yourself in more rot because the cycle of reality TV and digital culture and inquisitiveness and aspiration is all cycled throughout the culture. You're not escaping it when you immerse yourself in selling sunset. You're actually embracing it.</p>
</details>

>> 我认为，关于真人电视，以及“现实”这个词，用来描述任何形式的娱乐，甚至是纪录片，都是一个糟糕的说法。一旦你编辑并将其压缩成一个小时或两小时的节目，它就不再是真实的了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Um I think that you know the interesting thing about reality television and reality is a terrible you know way to to talk about any any form of entertainment even documentary. Nothing is real once you edit it and and you know contract it into an hour or a twohour package.</p>
</details>

>> 但我认为，关于非脚本电视（unscripted television）有趣之处在于，它实际上可以在一个高度构建的包装中保持高度的真实性。当它奏效时，即使像《日落豪宅》这样精心设计的节目，正如你所提到的，女性们穿着去参加晚宴的服装，却要去展示一栋房子，而且是在下午三点。这太荒谬了。那个节目在拍摄和灯光上，以及参与者们，尽管他们是真实的人，在自己的生活中表现得像自己，但它仍然是完全制作出来的，这与大多数非脚本电视节目不同，因为坦率地说，我们没有那样的预算，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> But I think that um what what's interesting about unscripted television is that it is actually can be highly authentic within a very constructed package. And when it works, even with something as contrived as selling sunset where, as you mentioned, you know, women are dressed, you know, to go to, you know, like for like a, you know, a black tie party when they're going to show a house at like, you know, 3:00 in the afternoon. I mean, it's absurd. the that show is is shot and lit and and the and the participants even though they are real people behaving and acting as themselves in their own lives it is all fully produced in a way that most unscripted television isn't because frankly we don't have the budget for that right</p>
</details>

>> 但我想说的是，真人秀之所以能成功，或者说非脚本电视之所以能成功，即使是在《日落豪宅》这样的节目中，也是因为尽管有种种的刻意安排，它触及了人们内心深处的东西，是人们正在与之产生共鸣的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> but what I would say is that you know reality TV works or unscripted television works even on selling sunset because despite all the contrivance it gets at something that people are connecting to.</p>
</details>

### 选角与风险：什么让节目引人入胜？

我希望你能为我们揭开一点面纱，谈谈你参与制作的节目的选角。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm hoping you can pull the curtain for us a little bit in terms of considering casting for shows that you work on.</p>
</details>

>> 什么造就了一个好角色？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> What makes a good character?</p>
</details>

>> 这真的取决于你想要达到什么目的。比如，对于《加拿大烘焙大赛》，我认为对于一些烹饪节目来说，因为那个节目的目标是“这将改变你的人生”，我们想看到人们互相竞争。我们想看到一些冲突，这可能确实会模仿一家高端厨房里的真实环境。我们可能会为《加拿大烘焙大赛》选择性格和烹饪技巧兼具的人。显然，我们会寻找加拿大人会喜欢的观众。我们会考虑我们如何代表整个国家，从地理和人口统计学上来说，但你真的需要是一位出色的烘焙师。我是说，对于那个特定的节目，观众想看到的是艺术家。我们花大量时间与他们交谈、测试他们并采访他们，以了解他们的技能水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> It really depends on on what you're going for. Yeah, for Well, at for the Great Canadian Baking Show, you know, I think that for some culinary shows, um, because the objective of that particular show is that this is going to change your life. We want to see people sort of battle it out. We want to see, you know, some some conflict which might actually mimic an authentic uh environment on the on the line at a at a high-end kitchen. We we may we may cast for a mix of personality and cooking skill for something like The Great Canadian Baking Show. Obviously, we look for people who Canadians are going to love. We look at at how we represent the country as a whole geographically, demographically, but you really really need to be a great baker. I mean, if for that particular show, that audience wants to see people who are</p>
</details>

>> 艺术家，我们花了很多时间与他们交谈、测试他们并采访他们，以了解他们的技能水平。嗯，对于像《Listing Large》这样的节目，这是一个关于多伦多北部地区房地产经纪人的节目，它是由一对分分合合的情侣支撑起来的，他们最终走到了一起，结婚并有了两个孩子。我是说，谢天谢地，因为他们生活中发生的事情确实推动了节目的故事线。但是，你知道，这一切都是在美丽的多伦多房地产背景下发生的。但是，他们如果没有如此出众的外表和极具魅力的个性，他们就不会有机会让自己的生活呈现在镜头前。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> artists and we we spend a great deal of time um you know talking to them, testing them and and interviewing them to get a sense of their skill level. um for something like Listing Large, which was a group of real estate agents based in uh um I think the northern part of uh Toronto, we it it was anchored by a onag again off-again couple that ended up coming together and getting married and having two kids at the end of the show. I mean, thank God for that because that real life thing that was happening really drove the story of the show. But, you know, it was against the background of of beautiful Toronto real estate. But the, you know, the would not have have had the chance to have their lives um, you know, on camera if they weren't also extraordinarily good-looking and very charismatic,</p>
</details>

>> 对吧？这一切都很重要。我想谈谈节目中的竞争元素。我们在约会节目中也能看到这一点。我们可以举出很多例子。但是，是什么让提高赌注（upping the ante）创造了更高的收视率，当有东西在“赌注”上时？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> right? That all plays in. I want to pick up on sort of the competition aspect of it. We see this even in dating shows. Uh, we can name a bunch of them. Um but the there is what is it about sort of upping the ante that has created or or does it create a higher viewership uh when there is a something at stake?</p>
</details>

>> 这是个好问题。是的，我认为在我看来，在我经验中，有两种风险：要么是消费这些故事，要么是尝试写它们。我认为有外部风险，比如在《日落豪宅》的案例中，他们会卖掉这栋数百万美元的豪宅吗？我的客户想以 7500 万美元的价格卖掉他的房子，如果我没有以高价卖掉，他会生我的气吗？然后是内部风险，我们认识并喜爱的角色。我认为 Chriselle 成为了那个节目中非常受欢迎的角色，她有一种完美的叙事方式，可以在一个充满财富和奢华的空间里做出贡献。她有一种与无家可归相关的经历，这与许多观众关于“美国梦”的价值观相符——摆脱困境，并且有可能成为我们屏幕上那些人一样，看起来也像他们。这是幻想，但它会在潜意识层面触动你。所以，是的，我认为像这样提高风险，无论是外部的还是情感上的，都是让我们如此与之产生联系的原因，正如 Kathy 所说。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> That's a good question. Yeah, I think you know there's there's two kinds of stakes in in my view in my experience either consuming these kinds of stories or even trying to write them sometimes. I think there's the external stakes, which is, you know, are they gonna, in the case of selling sunset, are they going to sell this this million-dollar mansion, is my client who wants to sell his house for $75 million going to um be mad at me if I don't sell his house for an exorbitant amount of money? Um, and then there's the internal stakes, you know, there's the characters that we come to know and love. I think um Cricelle has become such a fan favorite on that show and she kind of has a perfect um narrative to contribute in a space where you know we see a lot of wealth, a lot of opulence. um she kind of has this experience with homelessness and it kind of aligns with um a lot of viewers values around you know the American dream and and getting out of um a tough situation and that it is possible um to aspire to to to be like and look like the people who are on our screens and it is fantasy but it kind of does get to you on that subconscious level. So yeah, I think I think upping the stakes like that um both externally and emotionally is what makes us connect to it so much as Kathy said</p>
</details>

>> 伴随着这种联系，社交媒体上也建立了一个社区。但这对我们有什么代价呢？当我们观看这类节目时，在现实社区中是否会付出代价？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> with that connection there is also a community uh that is built on social media perhaps for example but how might and I'll bring back the rot but you know how might that be costing is there a cost to it in in sort of real life community when we are watching shows like this</p>
</details>

>> 我认为是的。我对自己沉迷《日落豪宅》及其衍生节目的经历进行了很多思考。你知道，我真的很投入，就像我之前提到的，有一段时间我给了自己一个“烂日”，但那并不是一个很好的“烂日”。那是我 binge-watched（沉迷观看）了太多集的一天。嗯，我开始质疑，如果我不是一直在追逐真人电视带来的慰藉，我是否可能正在面对我真实现实中的不适和困境？如果我更多地关注它，而不是逃避它，如果我们不总是渴望转向如今源源不断的娱乐，我们会做些什么呢？我开始质疑，我可能会成为谁？或者我会以什么方式更多地了解自己？我会以什么方式更多地了解自己的价值观，甚至将这些价值观付诸行动？无论是社区组织，还是仅仅是关心你的邻居，或者更清晰地思考我想要如何利用我有限的额外时间。嗯，是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think so I I thought a lot about this with my own journey with selling uh selling sunset and and its spin-off shows. You know, I I got really into it and and like I mentioned earlier, there was a time when I I gave myself a rot, but it wasn't it wasn't a great rot day. It was one of those days where I think I binge watched too one too many episodes. Um, and I started to kind of question, you know, if I wasn't constantly chasing the comfort of reality television, um, I might be facing the uncomfortable and discomfort of, um, my actual reality. Um, and if I was present with that more, if I wasn't so avoidant with it, and if we didn't have um, the urge to constantly run to this, you know, no shortage of entertainment that we have these days, what would we be doing instead? And I started to question, you know, who might I be or what sort of um what what ways would I get to know myself more and what ways would I maybe get to know my own values more and even pour those values into action, whether that's community organizing or or just showing up for my next door neighbor or or thinking more clearly about what I want to spend my my very little extra time doing. Um, yeah.</p>
</details>

>> 很快，在我问最后一个问题之前，你认为围绕这些节目建立的社区是怎样的？这些节目引起了很多人的共鸣。我们刚才在开拍前谈到了《加拿大烘焙大赛》以及其中的联系。但你从你通过这些节目培养起来的社区中看到了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Very quickly, I uh before I get to my last question too, what do you see in terms of the community that's built behind some of these shows? Some of these shows resonate with a lot of people. We talked just before we rolled about uh you know, the great Canadian Boff just all the connection there. But what are you seeing from the community uh that you've sort of cultivated with these shows?</p>
</details>

我认为粉丝们自己培养了它，我们对此控制不多，这很有趣。在《日落豪宅》这样的节目中，我认为所谓的风险是关于卖房子，我不知道有多少房子真的卖出去了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I you know I think the fans really cultivate it themselves and it we don't have a lot of control over that and it's a really interesting thing to see and you know it's interesting on on something like selling sunset I think the stakes supposedly as you say are about selling homes I don't know that a lot of homes get sold</p>
</details>

>> 我也不这么认为。[笑声]

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I don't think so [laughter]</p>
</details>

>> 我认为那些女性之间真正的风险，以及为什么它如此真实且观众能产生共鸣，是因为它是一场争夺社交媒体人气的血战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think the real stakes among among those women and why it is authentic and it or this is the authent authenti authenticity I think that the audience relates to is it is a blood match for social media popularity</p>
</details>

>> 并且节目中发生的许多事情都与她们的社交媒体后台紧密相关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and so many of the things that play out on that show are really connected to what is going on behind the scenes in their social media.</p>
</details>

### 怀旧与更简单的时代

>> 好了，我们不到一分钟了。给你们俩一个问题。我想把注意力转向怀旧。从电视到黑胶唱片和模拟技术（<strong>Analog world</strong>: A world or system that relies on physical, non-digital processes or interactions.），我们正在看到这一切被记录下来。谈谈 Z 世代的怀旧。作为一个千禧一代，看看现在的孩子们在做什么、喜欢什么，这是一种很好的了解方式，我们也知道什么在流行。但在艰难时期，似乎每个人都想回到他们认为是更简单的时代，一个更简单的过去。我很好奇，你最喜欢的怀旧或逃避式 binge（沉迷观看）是什么？为什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> All right, we have less than a minute. One question for both of you. I want to turn our attention to nostalgia. Um from TV to vinyl records and analog technology, we are seeing this being documented. talk about Gen Z's for as a millennial it's a nice little pulse check to see what you know what the kids are up to and into these days and we know that we're you know what's trending uh but in tough times it seems like everyone wants to go back to what they think as a simpler time a simpler past and I am just curious what is your go-to nostalgia or escape binge perhaps and why</p>

>> 我必须说，《吉尔莫女孩》（Gilmore Girls）。我就是那种去新闻学院学习，但仍然痴迷于那部剧的人。我是说，我以前在周六或周日早上在 W 频道和妈妈一起看《吉尔莫女孩》。当剧集内容对我当时的年龄来说有点不合适，或者我的父母很严格时，如果我爸爸在房间里，我妈妈就会换台。但是，你知道，那部剧就是典型的舒适。它发生在美丽的四季中，在一个小镇上。嗯，我每个秋天都会看一遍，它让我想起了和妈妈一起看这部剧的时光，剧中充满了搞笑的对话和标志性但有缺陷的角色。嗯，每个周末都和我的妈妈和姐姐一起看，是的，它每次都能触动我。我不知道该怎么说。每个秋天，它从不失约。

<p class="english-text">>> I've I've got to say Gilmore Girls um I am that person who went to journalism school and is still obsessed with that show. I mean, I watched Gilmore Girls, you know, Saturday mornings or Sunday mornings on, I think it was the W channel with my mom and when uh the episode got a little too inappropriate for my age and for my strict parents, my mom would change the channel if my dad was in the room. Um, but you know, that show is just quintessential comfort. It it takes place uh you know, throughout the beautiful seasons in this small town. Um, and I watch it every single fall and it just reminds me of, you know, watching this show with hilarious banter and iconic flawed characters. Um, every every weekend with my mom and my sister and yeah, it just hits every time. I don't know what to say. Every single fall, it never misses.</p>

好了。[笑声] Kathy，作为一名电视从业者，我不知道，也许我猜想你也在看什么，但也许有什么别的东西能带回一些怀旧感，同时也让你回到更简单的时代？

<p class="english-text">All right, [laughter] Kathy, as someone who works in TV, I don't know, maybe I'm assuming that it's it's something, you know, that you're watching, but perhaps something else that uh that brings back uh some nostalgia, but also takes you back to simpler times.</p>

>> 你知道，最近怀旧对我来说的体现方式是我们正在开发的节目类型。我现在正在开发的一个节目是一个约会节目，它将人们带回大学校园，让他们沉浸在一个时间胶囊里。而且，我认为它真的……而且你知道，这很有趣，因为它涉及到像 X 世代的人回到 80 年代的大学校园，但当我与年轻人交谈时，他们喜欢这个想法，因为约会、建立社区以及在模拟世界（analog world）中认识人的想法，确实契合了对更简单时代的这种怀旧之情。

<p class="english-text">>> You know, the way that nostalgia is playing out for me lately is in the kinds of shows that we are developing. And um one of the shows that I'm I'm developing right now is a dating show that takes people back in time to uh a university campus in which they're immersed in basically a time capsule and and and I think that it really and and you know it's interesting because it involves people like Gen Xers going back to an 80s college campus but when I talk to younger people they love the idea idea because the idea of dating and and and having community and meeting people in an in an analog world is really plays into this nostalgia for a simpler time.</p>

>> 好了，我们就到这里。我们会密切关注[笑声]那个节目。拭目以待。好了，Kathy，Sarah，非常感谢你们。非常感谢你们的见解。
