<p class="english-text">Hi everybody, tune in to this short version of the podcast, which we do every Friday. For the long version, tune in on Wednesdays. Hi everybody, I'm Nikola Tangen, and today I'm here with one of the most incredible tech entrepreneurs of all time, who started off in his freshman dorm room and built his company into one of the largest technology companies in the world. Now, one-third of you will have a PC with his name on: Michael Dell. Welcome. Thank you so much, great to be with you.</p>
</details>

**Michael Dell:** 非常感谢，很高兴能和大家在一起。

### 早期洞察：拆解IBM电脑的发现

**Nikola Tangen:** 迈克尔，通常我会从现在开始谈起，但我觉得谈到您，我们必须追溯到最初。您当时非常年轻，买了一台**IBM**（International Business Machines: 国际商业机器公司，美国一家跨国科技和咨询公司）电脑。大多数人会开始用它来做电脑相关的事情，但您却把它拆开了。这是怎么发生的？您在电脑里看到了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Normally, Michael, I would start with the present, but I think when it comes to you, we have to go all the way back to the beginning. You were very young and you bought an IBM computer. Most people would start to do computer things, but you took it apart instead. How did that happen? What did you see inside that computer?</p>
</details>

**Michael Dell:** 嗯，那时候你确实可以学到很多东西，因为当时还没有我们今天这种由许多小芯片融合而成的大型芯片。所以，你真的可以拿到一本书，它会解释每个芯片的功能，你就能理解电路。正如我所说，我当时在升级电脑，让它们能做更多事情：更多的内存、更多的存储空间，让它们运行得更快。我在那台IBM个人电脑里发现，所有的部件都不是IBM制造的。然后我发现，他们对电脑的定价大约是部件成本的六倍。我觉得这个价格太贵了，很不公平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, back then, you could actually learn a lot because you didn't have these large chips that we have today that are an amalgamation of lots of small chips. And so, you could literally get a book that would explain what each chip did, and you could understand the circuits. As I said, I was upgrading computers to make them do more: more memory, more storage, make them go faster. What I found in this IBM personal computer was that none of the parts were made by IBM. Then I discovered that the price they were charging for the computer was roughly six times the cost of the parts. It didn't really seem fair to me that it was that expensive.</p>
</details>

**Michael Dell:** 在那个阶段，IBM是世界上最有价值的公司，而您当时才16岁。他们是世界上最有价值的公司，占据了当时被称为“科技”行业的约80%的价值。所以，他们在自己的行业中比历史上任何时候的任何公司都更具主导地位。我的意思是，今天有任何公司能占据**S&P 500**（Standard & Poor's 500: 美国500家大型上市公司股票指数）某个行业80%的份额吗？不，根本没有。所以，是的，他们当时是一家非常成功的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">IBM was the most valuable company in the world at that stage, and you were 16 years old. They were the most valuable company in the world, and they were about 80% of the value of the sector called technology at the time. So, they were more dominant in their sector than any company, maybe, in any time in history. I mean, are there any companies today that are 80% of one sector of the S&P 500? No, not even close. So, yeah, they were an incredibly successful company.</p>

### 戴尔的诞生与早期成长

**Michael Dell:** 后来我去了大学，在德克萨斯大学。我主修生物学，本该成为一名医生，因为我父母希望我学医，这算是家族生意，你知道，成为一名医生。父母对此非常鼓励。所以，我不再住在父母家里，而是在宿舍里，我有很多时间。德克萨斯大学是一所大学校，有些课程规模庞大，你来不来上课他们不一定会注意到。所以，我开始做电脑相关的事情，而且规模越来越大。我父母发现了，他们非常生气，让我停下来。我停了10天，就在那时我决定这实际上是更重要的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then I went off to college, to the University of Texas. I was a biology major; I was supposed to be a doctor because my parents wanted me to study Pre-med, sort of the family business, you know, to be a doctor. Strong encouragement from the parents. So, I'm not in my parents' house anymore; I'm in the dorm room. I've got a lot of time. The University of Texas is a big school; some of the classes are enormous. If you show up or you don't show up, they don't really notice all the time. So, I'm kind of doing this computer thing, and it's getting bigger and bigger. My parents found out about it, they got very upset, and they kind of made me stop. I stopped for 10 days, and that's when I decided that this was actually something more.</p>
</details>

**Michael Dell:** 所以，在1984年5月初，公司注册成立了：**Dell Computer Corporation**（戴尔电脑公司: 迈克尔·戴尔创立的个人电脑制造商）成为一家公司。那是在我大一期末考试前一两周。第一年，我们实现了600万美元的收入，第二年大约是3300万美元。在最初的八年里，我们每年复合增长率约为80%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, in early May of 1984, the company was incorporated: Dell Computer Corporation became a corporation. It was about a week or two before my final exams of my freshman year. The first year, we had $6 million in revenue, and the second year was about $33 million. We grew about 80% per year for the first eight years compounded.</p>

### 美国创业文化与风险接受度

**Nikola Tangen:** 您认为为什么美国的创业者比其他地方多？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why do you think there are more entrepreneurs in America than elsewhere?</p>
</details>

**Michael Dell:** 我认为文化中有一种特质，那就是以一种好的方式接受甚至拥抱风险。它会说：“好吧，如果你尝试了某件事，但它不太奏效，你失败了，没关系，再尝试别的。”也许这种观念在其他地方并不那么被接受。我认为这是多种因素的结合：这种风险接受度，愿意为此投资的资本，以及你可以借鉴的其他企业家的历史——我借鉴过，其他人也借鉴过，他们会说：“嗯，他们做到了，也许我也可以做到。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think there's something in the culture that is accepting, even embracing, risk in a good way. It says, 'Well, okay, if you try something and it doesn't quite work, and you fail, it's okay, try something else.' And maybe that's not as accepted everywhere. I think there's a combination of factors: it's this risk acceptance, it's capital that will invest behind that, and there's a history of other entrepreneurs that you can look to—that I look to and others look to—and say, 'Well, yeah, they did it, so maybe I could do it.'</p>
</details>

**Nikola Tangen:** 当时您觉得有风险吗？您有过恐惧吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Did you think it was a risk at the time? Did you ever have fear?</p>
</details>

**Michael Dell:** 不，没有。如果你一无所有，就没什么可失去的，对吧？所以，这看起来不是一个很大的风险。我的意思是，对我来说，风险是如果它不成功，我就回大学继续读书。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, no. If you have nothing to lose, right? So, it didn't seem like a big risk. I mean, the risk for me was if it didn't work, I'd go back to college.</p>
</details>

### PC创新与AI的未来

**Nikola Tangen:** 您的收入有三分之一来自商用PC，就像我桌上这台一样。现在这里正在发生哪些重要的创新？它们看起来变化不大，对吧？我的意思是，它们看起来有点像我去年和前年用的那台。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, a third of your income is from commercial PCs, like the one I have on my desk. What are the important innovations taking place here? Now, they look a bit like they don't change that much, right? I mean, they look a bit like the one I had last year and the year before.</p>
</details>

**Michael Dell:** 嗯，实际上，PC的功能已经和以前大不相同了，所以我们不断要求它做更多的事情。现在，PC领域正在发生的大事是人工智能（AI）。我们以前有**CPU**（Central Processing Unit: 中央处理器），然后有了**GPU**（Graphics Processing Unit: 图形处理器），现在我们有了一种叫做**NPU**（Neural Processing Unit: 神经网络处理器）的东西。它是处理器的一部分，能够以惊人的速度加速PC上发生的人工智能活动。几乎所有你正在使用的软件都在被重写，以便在任何时候出现提示或用户交互时，都能利用AI增强和优化体验。大部分AI，可能85%到90%的AI，都将在你的PC上本地运行，这可能是正在发生的最大变化。此外，还有更长的电池续航时间。我们现在有超过24小时的电池续航，还有超亮显示屏、超薄、超轻、非常安全——所有你希望在新机器中拥有的东西，来取代用了好几年的旧机器。所以，如果你想走在时代前沿，我们基本上会继续购买新机器。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, actually, what the PC does is very, very different than it used to do, and so we keep asking it to do more and more things. Right now, the big thing that's going on in the PC is AI. We used to have the CPU (Central Processing Unit: 中央处理器), then we had the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit: 图形处理器), and now we have something called the NPU (Neural Processing Unit: 神经网络处理器). It is a part of the processor that speeds up the AI activities that occur on the PC to an incredible degree. Pretty much all the software you're using is being rewritten so that anytime there's a prompt or some user interaction, that experience is enhanced and made better using AI. Most of that AI, maybe 85-90% of it, will run locally on your PC, and that's probably the biggest thing that's going on, in addition to longer battery life. We have more than 24-hour battery life, super bright displays, super thin, super light, very secure—all the things you'd want in a new machine to replace one that's several years old. So, we will continue to buy new ones, basically, if you want to be in the future.</p>

### 戴尔的私有化与转型之路

**Nikola Tangen:** 您的公司在证券交易所上市了25年，然后在2013年，您将戴尔**私有化**（将上市公司股权全部收购，使其退市）以退出股市，对吗？您为什么要这样做？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You were listed on a stock exchange for 25 years, and then in 2013, you took Dell private to get off the stock exchange. Correct? Why did you do that?</p>
</details>

**Michael Dell:** 大约在2010年，我们开始将公司发展到新的领域。我们进行收购，并构建了云、数据中心、网络和存储能力。我们做得越多，市场就越不喜欢。与此同时，另一件事正在发生：智能手机和平板电脑正在崛起。很多人看到智能手机和平板电脑后说：“嗯，这是新事物；我们不再需要PC了，因为我们有这些其他设备。”而戴尔，尽管它有所有这些其他业务，但它仍然被视为一家PC公司，所以“PC已死，因此戴尔也死了”，对吧？所以股价持续下跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Around 2010, we started evolving the company into new areas. We were making acquisitions and building cloud, data center, networking, and storage capabilities. The more we did that, the less the market liked it. At the same time, something else was going on: the smartphone and the tablet were on the rise. A lot of people looked at the smartphone and the tablet and said, 'Well, that's the new thing; we don't need the PC anymore because we have these other things.' And Dell, even though it has all these other businesses, is kind of a PC company, so 'the PC's dead, therefore Dell's dead,' right? So, the stock kept going down.</p>
</details>

**Michael Dell:** 有一次，股价非常低，我心想这有点疯狂。这家公司每年产生数十亿美元的**自由现金流**（公司在支付运营费用和资本支出后所剩的现金）。在其生命周期中，它已经产生了1500亿美元的现金流。“我们干脆进行一次大规模回购吧；把所有股票都买回来。”所以我们就是这么做的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At one point, the stock was really low, and I thought, 'This is kind of crazy.' This company is generating lots of free cash flow (自由现金流: 公司在支付运营费用和资本支出后所剩的现金), billions of dollars of free cash flow every year. It had generated $150 billion of cash flow in its lifetime. 'Let's just do a huge buyback; let's buy back all the shares.' So, that's what we did.</p>
</details>

**Nikola Tangen:** 但在私有化之后，您还收购了**EMC**（易安信: 一家领先的数据存储和信息管理公司），那是一笔非常大的交易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But when it was private, you also acquired EMC (易安信: 一家领先的数据存储和信息管理公司), a very big deal.</p>
</details>

**Michael Dell:** 是的，我们当时花费了大约670亿美元，对吧？这是当时全球最大的科技收购案。所以，当我们把戴尔私有化时，那是科技史上最大的一次私有化交易。然后，一家私有公司又收购了一家670亿美元的上市公司并将其私有化，这很有趣。那次收购极大地加速了我们的转型。后来我们又有点像一家上市公司了，因为我们拥有与EMC在**VMware**（威睿: 一家提供云计算和虚拟化软件及服务的公司）所有权相关的**追踪股票**（旨在追踪母公司特定业务部门业绩的股票）。最终，我们在2018年底再次成为一家完全的上市公司。我认为这是有史以来最赚钱的私募股权交易，我是这么听说的。它进展得很顺利；本来可能会更糟，但结果很好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We spent like $67 billion, right? The biggest technology acquisition the world had seen. So, when we took Dell private, it was the largest take private (私有化: 将上市公司股权全部收购，使其退市) ever in technology. And then a private company bought a $67 billion public company and took it private too, which was kind of fun. That significantly accelerated our transformation. We then kind of became like a public company because we had a tracking stock (追踪股票: 旨在追踪母公司特定业务部门业绩的股票) associated with EMC's ownership in VMware (威睿: 一家提供云计算和虚拟化软件及服务的公司). Ultimately, we became a fully public company again at the end of 2018. It's the most profitable private equity deal ever, I think that's what I'm told. It worked out well; could have been a lot worse, but it worked out well.</p>

### 戴尔的企业文化：赢与幽默

**Nikola Tangen:** 戴尔的核心文化是什么？您会如何描述它？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is the core culture at Dell? How would you describe it?</p>
</details>

**Michael Dell:** 它是关于胜利的。它是关于为我们的客户创造价值的。它是关于理解他们的需求并解决这些需求的。它是一种结果导向。它是一种“友善竞争但求胜”的精神。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's winning. It's delivering value for our customers. It is understanding their requirements and solving them. It is a results orientation. It is 'play nice but win.'</p>
</details>

**Nikola Tangen:** 您提到了几次“乐趣”，很明显您比大多数首席执行官更有趣。这非常清楚。幽默在您的公司中扮演着怎样的角色？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You mentioned 'fun' a few times, and clearly, you are more fun than most CEOs. That's very clear. What place does humor play in your company?</p>
</details>

**Michael Dell:** 我认为幽默非常重要。我的意思是，如果你不能开怀大笑、开玩笑、捉弄别人，那你就做错了。所以，你必须能够自嘲，能够开怀大笑。幽默非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think humor is very important. If you can't laugh, joke around, play tricks on people, you know you're doing it wrong. You have to be able to laugh at yourself and laugh. Humor is incredibly important.</p>
</details>
