title: 加拿大放宽中国电动汽车关税：市场影响与安全考量
summary: 加拿大与中国达成协议，将中国电动汽车的关税从100%降至6.1%，允许进口49,000辆。此举旨在解决两国贸易紧张关系，并可能刺激加拿大本土的汽车及电池制造投资。访谈深入探讨了该协议对加拿大电动汽车市场的潜在影响，分析了当前加拿大电动汽车销量低迷的原因（主要是价格和联邦补贴取消），并指出中国电动汽车填补了市场价格空白。同时，讨论也触及了对中国电动汽车数据安全和国家安全的担忧，以及加拿大实现2035年零排放汽车销售目标的挑战。

### 加拿大电动汽车新政

**主持人**: 加拿大总理**马克·卡尼**和中国国家主席**习近平**最近宣布，在两国关系紧张多年后达成了一项协议。中国电动汽车的关税将被取消，最多可达49,000辆，以换取中国降低其对菜籽的关税。安大略省省长**道格·福特**最初对这项协议并不满意，非常不满意，但与总理的会面似乎缓和了紧张气氛。战略上，成立了一个工作组与安大略省就战略和就业保护进行协商。那么，中国电动汽车在这里的市场潜力有多大？这个国家的司机们会接受它们吗？我与加拿大汽车记者协会前主席**斯蒂芬妮·伍德克罗夫特**进行了交谈，讨论了更便宜的电动汽车将在安大略省和加拿大其他地区如何推广，以及这将如何颠覆市场。斯蒂芬妮，很高兴你能来节目。你好吗？

**Host**: Prime Minister Mark Carney and Chinese President XI Jinping recently announced they'd struck a deal after years of tension between their two countries. Tariffs on Chinese EVs will be lifted on up to 49,000 vehicles in exchange for China lowering its tariffs on canola. Premier Doug Ford wasn't initially happy about the deal. Not happy at all, but a meeting with the Prime minister seems to have brought the temperature down. The strategy a task force with Ontario to consult on strategy and job protection. So how big could the market here be for Chinese EVs? Will the drivers of this country embrace them? I sat down with Stephanie Woodcroft, former president of the Automotive Journalists Association of Canada, to talk about how cheaper EVs will roll out in Ontario and the rest of Canada, and how much this will shake up the market. Stephanie, great to have you on the show. How are you doing?

</details>

**Stephanie Woodcroft**: 很好。谢谢。很高兴来到这里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephanie Woodcroft**: Doing great. Thanks. Very happy to be here.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。我们要谈谈**道格·福特**。首先，他的态度有所转变。自从会见总理**马克·卡尼**和工业部长**梅兰妮·乔利**以来，他没有呼吁抵制中国电动汽车。你认为他们可能告诉了他什么计划？我知道我们还有很多细节想了解，但你认为是什么让他稍微平静下来了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. We're going to talk about Doug Ford. First off a bit of a change of tune. He hasn't called for a boycott of Chinese EVs since he met with Prime Minister Mark Carney and Industry Minister Melanie Joly. What do you think? They might have told him about the plan? I know there's lots of details that we'd like to know about it as well, but what do you think has kind of settled him a little bit.

</details>

**Stephanie Woodcroft**: 我不比其他人更了解内情，但我的猜测是，在那间房间里发生的事情，让**道格·福特**看到了**美元的符号**。是的，我认为这项中国-加拿大安排的某些方面涉及将一些**汽车制造**带到加拿大，可能还有**电池**制造。这非常有意义。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephanie Woodcroft**: And I'm not any more privy to information than anybody else, but my guess is not whatever happened in that room where it happened. I think Doug Ford was shown some dollar signs. Okay. Yes. I have a feeling that there are aspects of this China-Canada arrangement that involve bringing some manufacturing of vehicles to Canada, vehicles, possibly also batteries. It makes a lot of sense.

</details>

**主持人**: 这正是他想要的，对吧？回想一下卡尼总理在达沃斯说过的话，加拿大拥有世界所需的东西。当我们谈论加拿大拥有汽车行业所需的东西时，那就是**关键矿产**，对吧？所以这在财政上说得通，或者看起来是这样，因为我们现在看到其他汽车制造商也在争夺有利位置。**大众汽车**正在**圣托马斯**郊外建造一个电池厂。本周早些时候，我们得知韩国、中国和加拿大签署了一份谅解备忘录，可能将一些电池和汽车制造带到加拿大。这与**潜艇交易**有关，那是另一个话题了，对吧？但回到中国，这些都联系起来，使得在矿产来源地建造电池和汽车比将它们运往世界各地更有财政意义。所以我猜想，这项协议中有一部分尚未公开，可能涉及随着时间的推移扩大进入加拿大的**配额**。同时，中国也进行一些**制造投资**，这当然会带来**就业**并提振经济。考虑到安大略省北部正在开发的**环火带**，这非常有意义，制造将会在安大略省进行。这又回到了**道格·福特**成为一个快乐的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: What he wants, right? Speaking back to the point that Prime Minister Carney made in Davos that Canada has what the world wants, when we're talking about what Canada has that the auto industry wants, that's critical minerals, right? So it makes fiscal sense or it seems to because we're now seeing other automakers jockeying for position on this as well. Volkswagen is building a battery plant outside of St. Thomas. We just earlier this week learned that South Korea and China and Canada signed a memorandum of understanding around possibly bringing some manufacturing battery and vehicle to Canada. And that's related to the submarine deal, which is a whole other topic, right. But bringing that back to China, that those dots all connect to making it seem as though it makes fiscal sense to build the batteries and build the cars where the minerals are coming from, rather than shipping them around the world. So I would imagine there's a portion of this deal that hasn't gone public yet that may involve scaling up the the quota that comes into Canada over time. And with that, also China making some manufacturing investment, which of course brings jobs and just bolsters the economy. It makes a lot of sense with the Ring of fire being developed in northern Ontario, that that would end up being in Ontario, where that manufacturing would take place. And that brings us back to Doug Ford being a happy man.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。我们暂时离开头条新闻。我想谈谈去年的**数字**。2025年，加拿大**电动汽车**的销量暴跌。但看看**欧洲**、**非洲**、**中东**、**中国**，它们都在增长。为什么加拿大的电动汽车销量如此之低？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. Well, let's get away from the headlines for a minute. I want to talk about some numbers from last year. Sales of electric vehicles in Canada plummeted in 2025. Not the story. When we look at Europe, across Africa, the Middle East, China, they rose. Why are EV sales in Canada so low?

</details>

**Stephanie Woodcroft**: 很大程度上是**价格**问题，这也是我们讨论整个主题的原因，对吧？为了让任何不熟悉加拿大-中国协议的人都能了解情况，加拿大已承诺从中国进口49,000辆电动汽车，并降低关税。之前有**100%的关税**，以与美国相匹配。现在是**6.1%**，这是一个显著的下降，对吧？回到你的观点，欧洲、中东和其他市场已经在获得这些便宜的电动汽车。这49,000辆配额的50%旨在以至少低于**35,000美元**的价格出售。这是否会转化为实际到经销商处的价格是另一回事。但确实说明了我们目前市场上没有这个价位的车型。这创造了提振市场的潜力，尤其是在联邦政府取消了**电动汽车补贴**之后，而这些补贴是唯一能让一些汽车接近那个价位的因素。这恰好与你提到的销量下降同时发生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephanie Woodcroft**: A lot of that comes down to price, which is why we're talking about this entire subject, right to to recap, for anybody who's not familiar with the the Canada-China deal, it's 49,000 EVs that Canada has committed to bringing in from China at a lower tariff. There was a 100% tariff that was in place to match with the United States. This is 6.1% a significant drop, right? And to come back to your point, Europe and the Middle East and other markets are already getting those those cheap EVs. 50% of that allotment of the 49,000 is meant to be priced off the boat, at least under 35,000. Whether that's going to equate to that when it gets to dealership lots is a different story. But that does speak to the point that we don't have anything at that price point in our market right now. And this this creates the potential to to bolster that, especially in the wake of the federal government having cancelled the EV rebates, which were the only thing that were bringing some of those cars even close to that level. And that coincided exactly with that drop in sales that you were talking about.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么，可以说从中国进口的汽车在中国市场上不一定有竞争对手。目前在加拿大，存在一个明显的**缺口**。能否给我们一个大概的数字，比如目前一辆电动汽车的价格是多少？加拿大目前电动汽车的平均成本是多少？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So fair to say the cars that would be imported from China here don't necessarily have competition. Right now in Canada, there is a glaring gap. Or give us an idea of sort of maybe what is the price of an EV right now? An average cost of an EV right now in Canada.

</details>

**Stephanie Woodcroft**: 确实存在一个明显的缺口。嗯，是否说它“明显”取决于很多背景。目前，我们看到一辆**2027款雪佛兰Bolt**，有趣的是，它已经停产了。好吧，这是完全不同的主题，但它的**MSRP**（制造商建议零售价）略低于**40,000美元**，不含税费。这离我们谈论的35,000美元并不远。而且，某些省份和地区仍然提供**补贴**。所以，在国内有些地方你可以以更便宜的价格买到那辆车。所以，并非不存在，只是它不像可能的那样普及。这个故事的另一方面是，我们是否会立即看到来自中国制造商的便宜电动汽车？是的。这是我在新闻首次爆出时就谈过的事情。49,000辆不算什么。相对于整个加拿大汽车行业来说，这只是杯水车薪。我们每年销售约**190万辆**汽车。所以，电动汽车占其中的约5%。因此，我们谈论的是，从这项中国交易中，我们进口了大约占整个市场**2.5%到2.6%**的份额。在早期阶段，这不足以引起巨大的波澜。但它确实给其他汽车制造商带来了压力，迫使它们开始降低价格。补贴的初衷就是为了弥补电动汽车最初更昂贵的成本，并且原本打算在价格降至与**内燃机汽车**相当时取消补贴，它们从未打算永久存在，对吧？所以，这使得那些中国电动汽车，特别是中国品牌，能够填补这一损失，并将电动汽车的价格拉回到可以与内燃机汽车直接竞争的水平。我们会立即看到那些售价35,000美元的**比亚迪（BYD）**或**小鹏（Xpeng）**，这些中国品牌吗？我不知道这是否会立即发生，因为你谈论的是一个汽车制造商必须进入这个国家，设立总部，建立经销商网络。这需要时间，对吧？而一些加拿大人没有意识到的是，加拿大道路上已经有了中国制造的电动汽车。是的。我们谈论中国电动汽车时，会想到我刚才提到的那些品牌，但中国制造的电动汽车已经在我们的道路上行驶了一段时间了。是的。**特斯拉（Tesla）**，仅在2023年就进口了44,000辆**Model Y**。这几乎接近我们谈论的49,000辆了，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephanie Woodcroft**: There is a glaring gap. Well, whether I'd call it glaring depends on a lot of context. Right now, we're looking at a 2027 Chevrolet Bolt, which interestingly, has already been discontinued. Okay, it's a different subject entirely, but that is priced at an MSRP manufacturer's suggested retail price of just under 40,000 before fees. That's not that far off, that 35,000 that we're talking about. And certain provinces and territories still do offer rebates. So there are places in the country where you can get that car for cheaper. So it's not that it doesn't exist, but it's more that it's not as widespread as it could be. The other aspect of that storyline is do we immediately see those cheap EVs coming from Chinese manufacturers? Right. This is something that I spoke to when the news first broke. 49,000 is not. It's a drop in the bucket relative to the Canadian auto industry in general. We sell about 1.9 million cars a year. So that and the EV portion of that is about 5%. So we're talking about roughly 2.5 2.6% of the full market is what we're bringing in from this deal from China. And that's not enough to make huge waves at any level at this early stage. But it does put pressure on other automakers to to start bringing those prices down, which is the rebates were always meant to just make up for the fact that EVs were more expensive initially and were meant to. The rebates were meant to be removed when those prices came down to be at par with internal combustion engine vehicles, they were never meant to be permanent, right? Right. So what this does is sort of bring those Chinese, those Chinese EVs in particular back. They make up that loss and bring cars back, those EVs back down to a level where they can compete directly on price with internal combustion engine vehicles. Will we see immediately those $35,000 BYDs or Xpeng, those Chinese brands? I don't know if that's going to be an immediate thing, because you're talking about an automaker having to come into the country, set up a head office, set up a dealership network. That takes time, right? And what some Canadians don't realise is there are already Chinese built EVs on Canadian roads. Right? We talk about Chinese EVs in terms of those brands I just brought up, but there are Chinese built EVs that have been on our roads for a while. Right? Tesla, Tesla built, imported 44,000 just Model Ys in 2023. So that's pretty darn close to that.

</details>

**主持人**: 49,000辆，我们正在谈论的这个数字，对吧？一些人一直很担心，我不知道这是否是基于你的专业知识的真正担忧，但加拿大对中国访问**加拿大电动汽车用户数据**的担忧，是否比对北美汽车制造商的担忧更大？因为我认为当我们谈论电动汽车时，我们很容易想到**安全**问题。但这里有北美制造的电动汽车，它们可能存在同样的担忧，但我们却没有发出那些危险信号。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: 49,000 that we're talking about, right? One of the things that a few people have been concerned about, and I don't know if it's a genuine concern from from your expertise, but what worries does Canada have about Chinese access to Canadian EV user data that it doesn't have already with North American automakers? Because I think when we talk about EVs, we jump right to security concerns. But there are EVs here in North America. North American made that that potentially could have the same concerns. But we don't have those red flags.

</details>

**Stephanie Woodcroft**: 我不知道这是否是电动汽车本身成为讨论焦点。我认为更多的是这些汽车来自中国，并且它们拥有大量的**软件**和**技术**。有趣的是，**黑莓（BlackBerry）**实际上为**比亚迪（BYD）**提供软件。所以，那里已经存在加拿大-中国之间的联系，加拿大深度参与其中。那么，这是杞人忧天还是事实？很难说，但确实有一些关于非常高级别的**国家安全**问题的讨论，这听起来很疯狂，但中国曾被指控在中国制造的车辆中植入**关停操作**，以便他们能够远程阻止车辆运行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephanie Woodcroft**: I don't know that it's the fact that it's EVs specifically that are the discussion point there. I think it's more that the cars are coming from China, and they have an awful lot of software in them, a lot of technology in them. Interestingly, it's BlackBerry that actually supplies the software for BYD. So there's already a Canada-China connection there, and Canada is deeply involved in that. So is it tinfoil hat or not? It's hard to say, but there has been some discussion of, you know, really high level national security things like it's it sounds crazy, but China has been accused of putting shut down operations in, in Chinese built vehicles so that so that they would have a way to remotely just prevent them from.

</details>

**主持人**: 车辆停止工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: The vehicle from working.

</details>

**Stephanie Woodcroft**: 目前，在宣布成立汽车工作组时，乔利部长确实谈到了这一点，并表示**国家安全**问题已在他们的关注之列。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephanie Woodcroft**: Right now, in the announcement of the the auto working group, Minister Joly did address that and said that that national security concern is on their radar.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。在我们剩下的最后30秒里，加拿大仍然计划在2035年实现**100%零排放汽车销售**。没有中国制造的电动汽车，我们能实现这个目标吗？还是说它们必须是其中的一部分？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. In the last 30 seconds that we have, Canada is is still aiming to hit 100% zero emission vehicle sales by 2035. Are we going to get there without made in China electric vehicles or is that have to be part of the equation?

</details>

**Stephanie Woodcroft**: 我认为目前我们根本无法实现。我们原本应该在2026年达到20%，但这个目标被推迟到了2027年。即使有这项协议，我们谈论的也只占市场份额的2.6%。到2035年实现100%的目标似乎非常非常不可能。我的意思是，那是零排放汽车。所以也可以包括插电式混合动力汽车，但这似乎还很遥远。我不会感到惊讶，如果卡尼政府不撤回这个目标，作为正在进行的讨论的一部分，随着行业的发展。但这并不意味着它不是一个值得追求的目标。无论我们何时能在未来实现它。还有很多工作要做。这个讨论还有其他方面，比如**充电基础设施**，说服加拿大人他们不需要平均每天驾驶超过**400公里**，对吧？你不会每周都开车去落基山脉。这些心态上的改变对普通加拿大人来说似乎还有点距离。所以这是一个持续的讨论。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephanie Woodcroft**: I don't think we're going to get there at all at this point. We were supposed to be 20, 20, 20% by 2026 and that got pushed to 2027, even that, even with this deal. Again, we're only talking about 2.6% of the market here. That seems very, very unlikely to get to 100% by 2035. I mean, that's zero emission vehicles. So it can also include plug in hybrids, but it seems really, really far off. And I would be shocked if we don't see the Carney government pull back on that as part of this ongoing discussion situation as the industry evolves. But it doesn't mean it's not a worthwhile goal. It's whatever point in the future we can we can get there. There's a lot of work to be done. There's other aspects to this discussion, like charging infrastructure, convincing Canadians that they don't need to drive more than 400 kilometers on the average day, right? You're not going picking up and driving to the Rockies every week. Those kinds of mindset changes are still they still seem to be a little ways off for the average Canadian. So it's an ongoing discussion

</details>

**主持人**: 持续的讨论。也许当我们获得更多信息和时间时，我们会再次邀请你进行一次关于这个话题的谈话。
