### 美伊核谈判与地区紧张

**Tracy Mumford**: 来自《纽约时报》，这是今日头条。我是 Tracy Mumford。今天，星期二，2月17日。我们今天报道以下内容：美国与伊朗之间的核谈判即将启动，双方的军事力量展示导致紧张局势升级。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Tuesday, February 17th. Here's what we're covering today. Nuclear talks between the US and Iran will kick off and tensions are high as both countries have been flexing their military power.

</details>

**>>**: 我认为他们想达成协议。我认为他们不想要不达成协议的后果。他们想达成协议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: I think they want to make a deal. I don't think they want the consequences of not making a deal. They want to make a deal.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 特朗普总统，他已经派遣了他所谓的“舰队”前往中东，并威胁称，如果伊朗不放弃其核野心，将发动空袭。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: President Trump, who has sent what he's called an armada to the Middle East, has threatened air strikes if Iran doesn't give up its nuclear ambitions.

</details>

**>>**: 我希望，嗯，我希望他们能更理性一些。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: I hope uh I hope they're going to be more reasonable.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 伊朗方面，昨天在霍尔木兹海峡举行了实弹军事演习。这是一个狭窄的水道，连接着波斯湾和海洋。分析人士称，这显然是一次武力展示，意在表明如果需要筹码，伊朗愿意采取关闭海峡的行动，该海峡是石油和天然气的重要航运通道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Iran, for its part, held live military exercises in the Strait of Hormuz yesterday, a narrow waterway that connects the Persian Gulf to the ocean. Analysts say it was an apparent show of force meant to demonstrate that Iran would be willing to go as far as closing the strait, which is a key shipping lane for oil and gas if it needed leverage.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 去年，美伊官员曾试图就核设施问题谈判达成协议，但未获成功，美国还加入了以色列对伊朗的袭击，派遣隐形轰炸机打击了那些核设施。这一次，伊朗官员表示愿意讨论其核计划，但如果谈判破裂，该地区仍处于对美国可能发动袭击的戒备状态。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Last year, US and Iranian officials tried to negotiate a deal around nuclear facilities, but that was unsuccessful, and the US joined an Israeli attack on Iran, sending stealth bombers to strike those nuclear sites. This time, Iranian officials have said they're willing to discuss their nuclear program, but the region remains on alert for the possibility of an American attack if negotiations collapse.

### 美国秘密遣返争议

**Tracy Mumford**: 《纽约时报》获悉，特朗普政府上个月秘密将九人遣返至喀麦隆，尽管他们都不是来自这个中非国家。其中几名移民告诉《纽约时报》，在被戴上手铐、脚镣并送上遣返航班离开路易斯安那州之前，他们并不知道自己将被送往那里。一位在美国生活了15年的男子说，他们被扔在喀麦隆，“就像 UPS 的包裹一样”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: The Times has learned that the Trump administration secretly deported nine people to Cameroon last month, even though none of them are from the Central African country. Several of the migrants told the Times they didn't know they were being sent there until they were chained, handcuffed, and put on a deportation flight out of Louisiana. One man, who had lived in the US for 15 years said they were dropped in Cameroon, quote, like UPS packages.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 几乎所有这些移民都获得了法院命令，禁止他们被遣返至原籍国，因为他们声称自己是在逃离战争或迫害。对于特朗普政府来说，将他们送往喀麦隆似乎是一种“变通”方式。自被遣返至那里以来，他们中的大多数人一直被关押在一个营地，并被告知除非同意返回原籍国，否则不能离开。这是白宫越来越普遍的一种策略，即安排第三国遣返协议。根据最近的一项参议院调查，美国已支付了超过4000万美元来安排此类协议，将人员遣送至萨尔瓦多和赤道几内亚等国，即使他们并非来自这些国家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Nearly all of the migrants had been granted court orders preventing them from being deported to their home countries because they said they were escaping war or persecution. For the Trump administration, sending them to Cameroon appears to be a kind of workaround. Since being deported there, most of them have been held in a compound and told they can't leave unless they agree to go back to their original countries. It's part of an increasingly common strategy by the White House to arrange third country deportation agreements. According to a recent Senate investigation, the US has paid upwards of $40 million to arrange these kinds of deals, sending people to countries like El Salvador and Equatorial Guinea, even if they are not from there.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 批评者表示，政府正利用这些安排来规避法院命令，一位前 ICE 官员（来自拜登政府时期）称这种做法“简直是非法的”。喀麦隆和国务院的官员拒绝置评。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Critics have said the administration is using the arrangements to get around court orders, with one former ICE official from the Biden administration calling the practice quote flatly illegal. Officials from Cameroon and the State Department declined to comment.

### 民权领袖杰西·杰克逊逝世

**>>**: 我的选区是绝望者、被诅咒者、被剥夺者、被不尊重者和被鄙视者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: My constituency is the desperate, the damned, the disinherited, the disrespected, and the despised.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 民权领袖杰西·杰克逊（Jesse Jackson）已去世，享年84岁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: The civil rights leader, Jesse Jackson, has died at 84 years old.

</details>

**>>**: 民主党必须向他们发出一个我们关心的信号。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: The Democratic Party must send them a signal that we care.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 他是几十年来推动美国民权运动中最具影响力的人物之一。他是马丁·路德·金（Martin Luther King Jr.）核心圈子的一员，并在金博士于1968年遇刺时也在场。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: He was one of the most influential figures in the push for civil rights in the US for decades. He was part of Martin Luther King Jr.'s inner circle and was there when King was assassinated in 1968.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 随后，杰克逊成为家喻户晓的人物，在20世纪80年代两次竞选总统。他是第一位成为全国性竞选中严肃竞争者的黑人候选人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Jackson then became a household name of his own, running for president twice in the 1980s. The first black candidate to become a serious contender in a national contest.

</details>

**>>**: 我们绝不能投降。美国会变得越来越好。保持希望。保持希望。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: WE MUST NEVER SURRENDER. AMERICA WILL GET BETTER AND BETTER. Keep hope alive. Keep hope alive.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 他在全国民主党代表大会上发表了鼓舞人心的演讲，阐述了党派的愿景，吸引了有色人种和其他边缘化群体。直到2021年，79岁高龄时，他仍然活跃。他曾与其他抗议者一起在华盛顿被捕，当时他正在抗议共和党推动的投票限制措施。多年来，杰克逊也面临一些个人争议，批评者指责他在金博士去世后试图抢占聚光灯。他的全部政治抱负从未完全实现。但一些历史学家认为，杰克逊帮助在20世纪60年代投票权取得进展后，为该国第一位黑人总统的最终当选铺平了道路。一位历史学家说：“你不会因为杰西·杰克逊所做的事情获得诺贝尔奖，但这需要大量的才华、主动性、精力、想象力和魅力，而他拥有这一切。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: He gave galvanizing speeches at national democratic conventions articulating a vision for the party that drew in people of color and others who'd been marginalized. And he remained active as recently as 2021 when he was 79 years old. He was among protesters arrested in DC while speaking out against voting restrictions that were being pushed by Republicans. Over the years, Jackson also faced some personal controversies, and critics accused him of trying to seize the spotlight after King's death. His full political ambitions were never fully realized. But some historians credit Jackson with helping to pave the way after the voting gains of the 1960s to the eventual election of the country's first black president. One historian said, quote, "You're not going to get a Nobel Prize for what Jesse Jackson did, but it took a lot of talent, initiative, energy, imagination, and charisma, and he had those in full supply."

### 爱泼斯坦案余波显现

**Tracy Mumford**: 从曼哈顿到挪威，从好莱坞到迪拜，越来越多的富豪和有权势的人物，其名字出现在爱泼斯坦（Epstein）案卷中，现在正因与这位被定罪的性犯罪者的关联而面临后果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: From Manhattan to Norway, from Hollywood to Dubai, a growing number of the wealthy and powerful figures whose names surfaced in the Epstein Files are now facing consequences for their associations with the convicted sex offender.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 就在上周，**高盛（Goldman Sachs）**的首席律师，也是奥巴马政府时期的前白宫法律顾问，在与爱泼斯坦的关系程度变得清晰后，辞去了她的职务。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: In just the past week, the top lawyer at Goldman Sachs, who was a former White House counsel in the Obama administration, resigned from her position after the extent of her relationship with Epstein became clear.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 她在超过10,000份文件中被提及，称爱泼斯坦为“sweetie”和“uncle Jeffrey”，并就如何回应有关他性犯罪的问题向他提供建议。作为交换，爱泼斯坦向她赠送了奢侈礼物。在挪威，前首相因涉嫌收受爱泼斯坦的礼物而被指控严重腐败，其多处房产被搜查。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: She was mentioned in more than 10,000 of the documents, calling Epstein sweetie and uncle Jeffrey and advising him on how to respond to questions about his sex crimes. In exchange, Epstein showered her with luxury gifts. In Norway, the former prime minister was charged with gross corruption and had several of his property searched over accusations that he might have received gifts from Epstein.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 另外，就在昨天，另一位辞职的是亿万富翁**托马斯·普里茨克（Thomas Pritsker）**，他辞去了**凯悦酒店集团（Hyatt Hotels Corporation）**执行主席的职务。2018年，爱泼斯坦曾请普里茨克帮助他的女友卡琳娜·舒拉克（Karina Shulak）安排一次东南亚之行，舒拉克也插话说，她“要去为杰弗里找个新女友”。普里茨克则回复了一个笑脸。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And in another resignation just yesterday, the billionaire Thomas Pritsker stepped down from his role as executive chairman of the Hyatt Hotels Corporation. In 2018, Epstein asked Pritsker to help his girlfriend Karina Shulak arrange a trip to Southeast Asia with Shulak chiming in to say she was quote going to try to find a new girlfriend for Jeffrey. Pritsker responded with a smiley face.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 在**哥伦比亚大学（Columbia University）**，两名与牙科学院有关联的人员因绕过正常招生程序帮助舒拉克（爱泼斯坦的女友）入学而受到惩罚。她最初被拒绝，但在爱泼斯坦表示考虑向该校捐款后，几位有影响力的人士出面帮助她入学。哥伦比亚大学表示，已确认收到来自“与爱泼斯坦有关联的实体”的超过20万美元捐款，并表示将把这笔款项捐赠给支持性侵犯和人口贩运幸存者的人道组织。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And at Columbia University, two people affiliated with the dental college have been punished for bypassing the normal admissions process to help Shuliaak, Epstein's girlfriend, get into the program. She had initially been rejected, but after Epstein said he was considering a donation to the school, several influential people there moved to get her admitted. Colombia says it's identified over $200,000 in donations from what it called entities related to Epstein and said it would be donating that amount to groups that support survivors of sexual abuse and human trafficking.

### 冬奥会上的无人机

**>>**: 然后，现在看他去...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: And finally, >> but now look at him go

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: ...今年冬季运动会上。赛场上的声音不仅仅是欢呼的观众和气喘吁吁的解说员。还有无人机发出的高频嗡嗡声。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: ...at the Winter Games this year. The soundtrack isn't just cheering fans and breathless announcers. It's the high-pitched wine of drones.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: Never had a medal, John, in this event. They have, of course.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 这些装有摄像机的小型嗡嗡作响的机器，在滑雪赛道上紧随高山滑雪运动员，在溜冰场周围追踪速度滑冰运动员，并为在家观看的观众带来奥运会比赛的近距离第一视角。感觉就像在你肩上一样。无人机在十多年前的俄罗斯冬季运动会上首次亮相，但现在它们无处不在，由赛场边白色帐篷里的飞行员控制。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: The tiny buzzing machines with all their cameras are racing down slopes behind alpine skiers, tracking speed skaters around rinks and bringing viewers at home, up close firsterson views of the Olympic action. It can feel like you're right over the athletes shoulder. Drones made their debut more than a decade ago at the Winter Games in Russia, but now they're everywhere, controlled by pilots in a little white tent off to the side of the finish line.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 比赛中的一位无人机飞行员说，他的团队在比赛开始前与运动员进行了试飞，以便奥运选手能够适应，并且他说，如果他们担心分心，可以拒绝使用无人机拍摄的画面。然而，对于一些观众来说，无人机本身已经成为了表演。人们在比赛结束后会留下来观看无人机返回基地，并为它们精准着陆而欢呼。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: One of the drone pilots at the games said that his team had done test runs with athletes before the game started so the Olympians could get used to the and he said that they could decline drone footage if they were worried about being distracted while they're competing. For some of the spectators though, the drones themselves have become the show to watch. People have stuck around after races to see the drones navigate back to home base, cheering as they stick their landings.
