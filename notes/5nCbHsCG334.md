### 访谈开场与个人经历

**主持人**: 好的，各位。我们非常荣幸能邀请到独一无二的**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**，**微软**的第三任CEO，与AI和加密领域的**David Saxs**进行一场即兴炉边谈话。**萨蒂亚**是**微软**的第三任CEO，出生在印度，这是一个令人难以置信的故事。他大学毕业后就来到了这里，为了接妻子回来，他还特意回了一趟印度。能简单给大家讲讲当时的情况吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: All right, everybody. We're thrilled to have the one, the only **Tata Nadella** here, the third CEO of **Microsoft** for a impromptu fireside chat with **David Saxs**, Arzar of AI and crypto. **Satia** third, CEO of **Microsoft**, born in India. What an incredible story. came here right after college and you had a little round trip to pick up your wife in your book to to bring her here. Tell everybody briefly how that occurred.

</details>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: 嗯，这是一个关于美国移民政策迷宫的精彩故事。我和我的妻子在印度上的大学。我来这里读研究生，然后我们结婚了。我拿到了绿卡，但她因为我们结婚了就不能来团聚。所以，基本上我不得不放弃我的绿卡。有趣的是，我去了美国驻德里大使馆，问他们放弃绿卡的队伍在哪里，他们说没有这样的队伍。在90年代，那会是一件很疯狂的事。所以，放弃绿卡，拿到H1签证，让她能来团聚，这很奇怪，但最终都解决了。这已经是很久以前的记忆了，但这是一种解决问题的方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: Well, um, you know, so that's that's a great story of the the labyrinth that is the immigration policies of the United States I think. Um, I my wife and I went to college together in India. I came here for grad school. We then got married. I got my green card. Um, and she couldn't come join because we got married. So the story goes basically I had to give up my green card. So the funny thing is I went to the American embassy in Delhi

</details>

**David Saxs**: 那会是90年代一件疯狂的事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: and I said where's the line to give up my green card? And they said there is no such line. Um, that would be a crazy thing to do in the '9s. So it was a strange thing to give up your green card, get an H1 so that she could join, but it all worked out. So, um, you know, it's a long lost memory but it was you know, a way to work around it. Um, I wanted to ask you, uh, having

</details>

### AI与知识工作者的未来

**David Saxs**: 我想问你，**微软**先在**GitHub**推出了**Copilot**，然后又在桌面端推出了**Copilot**。**微软**做了一个非常大胆的举动，把它放进了**Windows**产品中，我每天都在桌面上使用它。但你在它真正能识别文件系统并与应用程序交互之前就这么做了，当时反响有点平淡。但现在你一直在加倍投入，在我看来，知识工作者有三种模式：**Elon**正在**XAI**构建他们所谓的“人类模拟器”，如果你看到了这周的泄露消息。他们正在构建员工，并把他们放入聊天室和电子邮件中。然后**Claude**这周推出了**Co-Work**，功能强大得令人难以置信，人们都为之疯狂。我过去40小时一直在玩它，确实令人印象深刻。你对**微软**的愿景是什么？知识工作者将如何实际应用它？因为在玩**ChatGPT**并获得一些有趣结果与获得商业成果之间似乎存在差距。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: I wanted to ask you, having launched a **Copilot** first with **GitHub** then having a **Copilot** on the desktop. You made a very bold move for **Microsoft** to put that in the **Windows** product, which I use every day, on the desktop, but you did that before it really could recognize the file system and interact with applications. Got a little bit of a lukewarm reception, but now you've been doubling down, doubling down, and there seems to be, in my estimation, three modalities for knowledge workers. **Elon**'s building at **XAI**, what they're calling a **human emulator**, if you saw that leak this week. Yeah. where they're just building employees and just putting them into their chat rooms and email. Then you have **Claude** came out with **Co-Work** this week. Incredibly powerful. People are kind of losing their minds over it. I've been playing with it for the last 40 hours. Truly impressive. What's your vision for **Microsoft** and how knowledge workers will actually put this to use because there seems to be a gap between you know playing around with **ChatBT** and getting some interesting results and getting business results.

</details>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: 是的，我认为理解这些不同形式因素最具说明性的例子之一是看编程，这显然是一种知识工作，或者说是知识工作最好的例子。如果你想想编程的历程，它始于“下一个编辑建议”，那是第一次，事实上，我对整个这一代技术的信念就是在那时形成的，当时我开始看到，我想那是**Codex**模型，在**GPT-3.5**之前，那时“下一个编辑建议”开始以相当高的准确性工作。然后我们转向了聊天，然后转向了动作，现在是完全自主的**智能体**。这些自主**智能体**可以是前台的、后台的、在云端的或本地的。所以，这些是今天编程时存在的所有形式因素，有趣的是，你会使用所有这些，对吧？它不是只有一种形式因素。所以，我认为这可能是另一个教训。例如，当我在CLI中时，我可以使用前台**智能体**、后台**智能体**，然后直接在**VS Code**中编辑。它们都在并行发生，对吧？所以这展示了这些形式因素是如何组合的。

然后你将它带到知识工作中，正如你所说。我们从聊天开始，带有推理的聊天超越了简单的请求-响应，因为你现在有了“思维链”，你可以看到它在工作。现在它们是动作，本质上是通过计算机使用或通过API，基本上是技能和**智能体**调用，所以你可以执行动作。这就是今天**Copilot**的状态。现在，有一种方式可以思考“心智理论”的演变，对吧？因为你需要，如果你记得，**乔布斯**对PC或计算机最好的描述是“思想的自行车”。**比尔·盖茨**也有一个我喜欢的说法，那就是“信息触手可及”。我们现在需要一个新的概念或隐喻来描述在AI时代我们如何使用计算机。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: Yeah. So I think it one of the most um perhaps illustrative examples um of trying to understand these various form factors is looking at coding which is obviously a form of knowledge work or uh probably the best example of knowledge work and if you think about the journey coding has been it started with u essentially uh uh the next edit suggest right that was the first time in fact my own belief in this entire uh generation of tech really sort of got formulated where I started seeing I think it was G you know there's a **Codeex** model back in the day it was pre**GPT35** uh that's when next edits started working with some real accuracy then we went to chat then we went to actions and now to full autonomous agents and then the autonomous agents can be both foreground background in the cloud or local right so that's all the form factors that exist today when you're coding and interestingly If you look at it, you use all of them, right? It's not like there's only one form factor. So that's I think probably one of the other lessons. So for example, when I'm in a CLI, I can you go a foreground agent, background agent, and then just literally go edit in **VS Code**, right? There all happening in parallel, right? So that sort of shows how these form factors even composed. So then you bring that to knowledge work to your point. We started with chat. chat with reasoning sort of goes beyond just request response because you now have that chain of thought uh where you can see it work now they're actions right essentially either through computer use or through uh AP you know basically skills uh and agent calls so you can do actions so that's kind of the state of the **Copilot** today now there is a way to think about you know the the theory of the mind evolution Right? Because you need like if you remember you know **Jobs** had the best line I would say for PCs or computers was to say if you it's a bicycle for the mind. **Bill** had a line which I liked as well which was it's information at your fingertips. We kind of need now a new concept metaphor for how we use computers in the AI age. And you have one

</details>

**David Saxs**: 你有一个吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: and the one I like actually came from

</details>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: 我喜欢的一个实际上来自**Notion**的CEO，你知道，那个管理者...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: and the one I like actually came from the CEO of **Notion** which I you know that manager of

</details>

**David Saxs**: 令人难以置信的产品。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: incredible product. Yeah.

</details>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: 你还没买它吗？我还没拿到。但它既是管理，基本上是“无限思维的管理者”。这是一个很好的思考方式，当你真正审视所有你正在合作的**智能体**时。你需要理解什么，事实上，我喜欢的另一个术语是“宏观授权和微观引导”。事实上，你在编程中确实需要它。所以你进行宏观授权，然后我可以在它工作的同时并行地给出指令。所以，这就是今天**Copilot**或类似工具的状态。你提到了我非常兴奋的一种形式因素，你会在下周看到我们做一些事情，那就是当我使用**GitHub Copilot**时，软件开发者并不是孤立工作的，对吧？我不是只在我的代码库上工作，我参加会议，我编写规范，或者其他人编写的规范我正在实现，我需要我的代码库与此保持一致。这意味着使用一个简单的MCP服务器或一个技能，我希望能够调用我的工作AI，也就是**Copilot**，将其引入。这就是知识工作的组合方式。安全领域也是如此，假设你是一名安全专业人员，你有很多日志，你如何真正分析它们？你把它们放到文件系统中，然后在上面编写代码，创建一个仪表板等等。这些都是我们可以实现的知识工作类型。

我认为你还提到了另一件事，那就是你是否可以创建所谓的“数字员工”或“数字同事”？这都与凭证有关，对吧？所以今天你可以，你可以真正地分配...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: You haven't bought it yet? I've not got that. Uh, but the it's both management of you know basically a **manager of infinite minds**. That's a nice way to think about it right when you sort of really look at all the agents that you are working with. You kind of need to understand what I in fact the other term I like is we **macro delegate and micro steer**. In fact you kind of need that in in in coding you kind of have it right. So you do a macro delegation and then I can in parallel give it instructions while it is doing work. So that's sort of the state even today of **Copilot** or what have you. you bring up a little bit of what one of one of the form factors I'm very excited about and you'll see us even in the next week even uh do things is while I'm sitting in **GitHub Copilot** what it's not as if software developers sit in isolation right it's not like the only thing I work on is my repo I attend meetings um I write specs or others have written specs that I'm implementing uh I need to have my repo be consistent with that so that means using either a straightforward MCP server or a skill I want to be able to call into my work IQ which is the **Copilot** bring that in that's the type of composition uh of knowledge work that'll happen same thing with security say you're a security professional you have lots of logs uh how do you sort of really analyze them you drop them into a file system then write code on top of it create a dashboard what have you those are the types of knowledge work that we can enable there I think you bring up one more thing which is can you create quote unquote **digital employees** **digital co-workers** or what have you and it's all about credentials right so the I today you could like you can literally assign

</details>

**David Saxs**: 你们也在做这个吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: are you working on that as well

</details>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: 是的，事实上，我们推出了一个叫做**Agent 365**的产品，作为一种赋予身份的方式，实际上是扩展我们今天为人类拥有的身份，以及我们为他们的计算设备提供的端点保护，延伸到**智能体**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: yeah so in fact we introduced something called **Agent 365** as a way to give identities in fact extending the identities we have for humans today uh and the endpoint protection we have for their compute devices to agents so

</details>

**David Saxs**: 所以你可能会克隆一个在人力资源部或市场部工作的我，并在Office内部拥有一个虚拟的、正确的版本？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: so you might clone me working in the HR department or working in the marketing department and have a virtual correct version of me inside of office.

</details>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: 正是如此。所以，这里有两种模式。一种是你赋予每个知识工作者“无限思维”。这是一种，然后你甚至可以创建独立于你身份的“无限思维”，因为身份是你需要正确处理的关键之一，即使是为了让它工作。对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: That's correct. So, so there are two sort of modalities there. One is you give every knowledge worker **infinite minds**. That's kind of one and then you create even **infinite minds** independent of the your identity because the identity is one of the key things you got to get right even for it to work right. Right. So

</details>

**David Saxs**: 权限。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: permissions

</details>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: 还有决策。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: and decision making

</details>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: 权限、决策，以及一个关键点是“谁对谁做了什么”，这是组织中最重要的查询。归根结底，组织需要了解完成了什么工作，这项工作的来源是什么，以及如何追溯。因此，你希望，如果是一个拥有大量**智能体**的人类，那么它实际上是人类进行的“宏观授权”和“微观引导”，其身份被传递。所以这是授权与独立身份的区别。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: permissions decision- making and like one of the key in things is who did what to whom is sort of the most important query in an organization right at the end of the day the organization needs to understand what work got done h and what's the provenence of that work uh and how do you trace it back right so therefore you kind of want either what if it's a human with a lot of agents then it's really macro delegation micro steering by the human whose identity was passed on. So it's delegation versus a separate identity.

</details>

### 组织结构与效率提升

**David Saxs**: 而这正是你、**Alphabet**和**Meta**四年前开始在组织中淘汰的管理层级、产品管理层级所做的事情。你现在**微软**的员工数量与四年前相同，但在此期间，你的营收增加了900亿美元，收入翻了一番。这是怎么发生的？是这些工作的自动化吗？还是你们之前有点人浮于事？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: And that was done by a level of management, product management that you've eliminated, that **Alphabets** eliminated. **Meta** has started to eliminate in their organization four years ago. You had the same number of employees you have at **Microsoft** now, but you put a $90 billion onto the top line of the revenue in that time and you doubled your income during that time. So how did that happen? Is that automation of those jobs? Is it you were a little bit overstaffed?

</details>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: 展开说说。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: Unpack.

</details>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: 我认为你实际上触及了一个非常有趣的问题，那就是在某种程度上，需要发生什么大的结构性变化。事实上，我会说这可能是自**PC**以来知识工作领域最大的变化。我总是思考工作是如何精确发生的，对吧？想想我们这样的跨国公司如何进行预测。传真满天飞，内部备忘录四处发送，然后你才能创建一个预测。然后突然**PC**成为标准配置，你用**Excel**电子表格输入一些数字，通过电子邮件发送，每个人都输入数字，然后你就有了预测。所以工作、工作成果和工作流程都改变了，这就是正在发生的事情。

举个例子，在**LinkedIn**，我们以前有产品经理、设计师、前端工程师，然后是CIS后端工程师等等。我们所做的是将前四个角色合并，实际上增加了他们的职责范围，并表示他们都是“全栈构建者”。我喜欢这一点，因为这是一种结构性变化，它使我们能够增加这些功能之间工作和工作流程的变化，我猜也能提高速度，因为你不需要四个人沟通，思想的流通更快，只需要一个人进行编码。正是如此。而且有一个新的工作流程。所以，与此同时，你可以想象，如果要构建一个AI产品，今天有一个全新的工作流程，它从评估开始。所以基本上，有一个从评估到科学再到基础设施的流程。评估由这些“全栈构建者”和新形式的产品经理完成，基础设施由后端系统工程师构建，因为他们支持科学，而科学又支持产品。所以在某种意义上，有一个新的循环，你必须进行结构性改变。所以，科技领域正在发生很多这样的变化，我认为这将是非常巨大的。与此同时，像我们这样的公司，我必须做所有事情。我不能只活在未来。我必须确保我们高质量地完成**Windows**的热补丁工作，同时构建改进**Copilot**质量的评估。对吧？所以这两者都必须做到一流。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: I think it's it's actually you're pulling on a very interesting thread which is at some level what's the big structural change that needs to happen. In fact, I would say this is probably the biggest change in knowledge work since **PCs**. I mean I always you know think about like how did work happen precise right? I mean think about a multinational company like ours trying to do a forecast. uh right faxes went around, inter office memos got sent and then you kind of created a you know uh a forecast then suddenly you know **PCs** became standard issue uh you put an **Excel** spreadsheet put some numbers sent it in email everybody entered numbers and you had a forecast so the work the work artifact and the workflow all changed that's what's happening so for example I'll give you uh at **LinkedIn** uh we used to have product managers we had designers uh we had front-end engineers and then we had CIS backend engineers and so on. So what we did is we sort of took those first four roles and combined them in fact increased scope and said let's they're all **full stack builders**. So I like that because that's a structural change that allows for us to increase the change both the work and the workflow between these functions and I would assume the velocity because you don't have four people communicating and that throughput of ideas it's just one person and vibe coding. Exactly. And there's a new workflow. So what at the same time as you can imagine if to build an AI product today there's a complete new workflow right it starts with **eval** right so basically there's this **eval to science to infrastructure** and so eval are done by these **full stack builders** and what have you and product managers in the new form the infrastructure is built by the systems engineers at the back end because they support the science that supports the product. So in some sense there's a new loop uh and you have to structurally change and so a lot of what is happening inside a tech is that change uh which is I think going to be pretty massive uh and at the same time a company like ours I have to do everything. It's not like I can just so go live in the future. I have to make sure we're doing a fantastic job of doing hot patching on **Windows** is done with quality uh while at the same time building the evals that are improving **Copilot** quality. Right? And so both of those have to be first class.

</details>

### 竞争格局与市场增长

**David Saxs**: 我认为这是你职业生涯中最具挑战性的时刻，因为**微软**在某些领域曾是如此主导的双头垄断。但你现在面临的竞争水平是前所未有的。我曾和**Elon**聊过，他说“造车相当容易，因为我面对的是传统汽车制造商，但现在我面对的是……”看看你现在面临的竞争对手，这是一个相当紧张的时期。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: I assume this is the most challenging moment of your career because **Microsoft** was so dominant duopoly in some spaces. Um but you really weren't up against the competition level you're up against now. I was talking to **Elon**, you know, and he was sort of saying, well, building cars was pretty easy. Uh because I was up against the legacy car makers and now I'm up against just look at the set you're up against. Yeah, it's it's a pretty intense time. I

</details>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: 是的，这是一个相当紧张的时期。我的想法是，每十年都有一批全新的竞争对手总是很有帮助的，因为这能让你保持活力。如果你想想看，我是在92年加入**微软**的，当时我们面临的最大生存竞争对手是**Novell**。现在我们来到了2026年，你完全正确，这是一个相当紧张的时期。我很高兴有竞争。说实话，归根结底，当我审视它时，五年后科技占GDP的百分比会是多少？它会更高。所以我们很幸运能在这个行业，竞争非常激烈，但它不像有些人说的那样是零和游戏。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: mean, so the way I I I always think is it's always helpful uh when you have a complete new set of competitors every decade because that keeps you fit. Uh if you think about it, I joined **Microsoft** in '92 when I had **Noel** as the big existential competitor we had. Um and here we are in 2026. Uh and it you're absolutely right, it's a pretty intense time. I'm glad there's the competition. uh it's it's quite honestly at the end of the day when I look at it right as a percentage of GDP 5 years from now where will tech be right uh it will be higher so we're blessed to be in this industry it's lot of intense competition but it's not so zero sum as some people make it out

</details>

**David Saxs**: 它正在变得越来越大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: it's getting much bigger

</details>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: 市场总额（**TAM**）和这项技术的影响将是如此巨大。当然，问题是，**微软**的品牌标识是什么？我们拥有品牌许可，客户对我们有什么期望？有时我们有点想太多，认为每个客户都希望从所有竞争对手那里得到同样的东西。我们需要找出这一点，对吧？这有点像**彼得·蒂尔**（Peter Thiel）观点的不同解读，即你必须通过真正理解客户对你的真正需求来避免竞争，而不是认为每个人都是竞争对手。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: much the **TAM** and the you know just the impact of this tech is going to be so massive um the question then of course is what is like I I always go back to what's the brand identity **Microsoft** has brand permission. We have what do customers expect from us. It's sometimes we kind of overthink somehow that every customer wants the same thing from all of the competitors and finding that out, right? It's kind of a different take on the **Peter Theal** thing which is you got to avoid competition by really understanding what customers really want from you uh versus thinking everybody's a competitor.

**David Saxs**: **David**。

### AI的全球扩散与生态系统

**David Saxs**: 是的。在**达沃斯**，显然有很多国家元首以及财富500强公司的CEO。我想你昨晚在晚宴上被问到一个问题，关于他们应该如何看待AI以及如何取得成功。我记得你用了“扩散”这个词，我想知道你是否能就这些评论进行阐述，因为这与我一直在做的一些政策工作产生了共鸣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Yeah. So there are a lot of heads of state here obviously at **Davos** as well as CEOs of Fortune 500 companies and I think you got asked a question last night at the dinner about how they should think about AI and how to be successful and I recall they used the word **diffusion** and I was wondering if you could expand on those remarks because that really resonated with some of the policy work I've been doing.

</details>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: 不，绝对如此。事实上，你们一直在做的工作，确保在美国科技栈的背景下，它能在全球范围内广泛使用并受到信任，因为我认为，回顾过去，**David**，对我来说，归根结底，你创造了技术，但真正的好处只有通过深入使用才能实现。事实上，我最喜欢的研究之一是**达特茅斯**的一位经济学家**迭戈·科曼**（Diego Comman）所做的研究，他研究了工业革命期间发生的事情，国家是如何领先的？简单的结论是，任何将最新技术引入本国，然后在其之上进行增值技术创新的国家。对吧？所以，这就像不要重复造轮子。引入最新的，然后在其之上进行构建。对我来说，这就是当你实现“扩散”时会发生的事情。

所以，特别是对于像AI这样的通用技术，它需要像野火一样蔓延。在我们自己的国家，在美国，我们现在拥有这项技术。问题是，它是否被用于医疗保健？它是否被用于金融服务？它是否被用于经济的每个部门，无论是大型企业、小型企业还是公共部门？所以对我来说，除非我们看到这种“扩散”和深入使用，否则我们不会取得成功。所以，这就是我们所处的阶段，它正在更快地扩散。因此，你所做的一些政策工作，以及总的来说，好消息是技术已经存在，围绕云和移动设备铺设的基础设施使得这项技术能够传播，对吧？获取令牌并非不可能，问题是使用场景是什么，以及如何管理所有这些变化。

例如，在**达沃斯**至少有一个问题是，这适用于西方和发达国家。那全球南方呢？我认为全球南方也有巨大的机会，坦率地说，因为对我来说，比如说，大多数全球南方国家GDP的40%到50%是公共部门。所以，想象一下这项技术如何改变政府将其纳税人的钱转化为公民服务的方式，如果能提高效率，那可能就是几个百分点的GDP增长。所以我非常乐观，认为会有一种拉动作用，我们作为美国，鉴于我们拥有的技术栈，应该在欧洲、亚洲、南美洲、非洲和世界各地广泛部署它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: No, absolutely. In fact, what you all have been doing to make sure in in this context of the American tech stack um is broadly used around the world and is trusted around the world because I think uh when I look back **David** to me um uh at the end of the day you create the technology but really the benefits come only by intense use. In fact, one of my favorite studies has always been this work that uh an economist I think out of **Dartmouth** did uh his name is **Diego Comman** where he studied uh basically what happened during the **industrial revolution** um how did countries get ahead? Um and the simple sort of takeaway from that was any country uh that brought the latest technology into their uh country and then did value add technology on top of it. Right? So it's like don't reinvent the wheel. Bring the latest and then build on top of it. That's to me uh what happens you know when you have **diffusion**. So especially with general purpose technologies like AI it needs to spread like right in our you know in our own country in the United States we now need we have the tech. The question is is it being used in healthcare? Is it being used um in financial services? Is it being used in every sector of the economy by large businesses, small business, public sector? Um so to me un unless and until we see that **diffusion** and intense use uh we're not going to have the success. Um uh and so that's the phase we are in it's f you know it's diffusing faster um and so some of the work policy work you have done um and in general all you know the good news here is the technologies there the rails around cloud and mobile that were laid out make it possible for this thing to spread right it's not you know impossible to get the tokens the question is what are the use cases how do and how do you manage the change in all of that um you know like one of the questions at least in **Davos** is it's one for the west and the developed nations. What about the global south? Um I think global south has a huge opportunity too quite frankly because to me like let's say you know 40% 50% of the GDP of most global south countries is public sector. So just imagine this tech making a difference in how the governments uh really parlay their taxpayer money into services for citizens and there's if there's efficiency gains that's probably couple of points of GDP growth right there and so I'm very optimistic that there's going to be a pull uh and that we should as the United States given the technology stack we have uh in Europe in Asia in you know in South America in Africa and everywhere get it to be broadly deployed.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 关于AI竞赛，我经常被问到的一个问题是，你如何知道自己是否正在获胜，或者美国是否领先于其全球竞争对手？我给出的答案是市场份额。如果你在五年后环顾世界，看到美国公司、美国技术拥有80%的市场份额，这意味着我们做得很好。如果我们五年后环顾世界，看到到处都在使用中国芯片和中国模型，那么我们可能就输了。所以，最终，使用是检验布丁的唯一标准。在这种情况下，你成功的标志就是市场份额，就是使用量。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: You one of the questions I get asked a lot about the AI race is how do you know if you're winning or how do you know if the United States is ahead of its global competitors? And the answer I give is **market share**. You know, if we look around the world in 5 years and we see that American companies, American technology has say 80% market share, it means we did a good job. If we look around the world in five years and see that it's say Chinese chips and Chinese models that are being used all over the world, well means we probably lost. So you know ultimately usage is the proof of the pudding is in the eating of it. I mean the in this case the way that you know that you're succeeding is through **market shares** through usage.

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: 我同意这一点。但是**David**，既然你也在**微软**工作过几年，你知道，我非常坚信**比尔·盖茨**关于“平台”的说法。所以，我总是思考的一点是，这不仅仅是市场份额，还有“生态系统效应”。你看，美国一直以来所做的，不仅仅是关于我们的市场份额，甚至也不是美国公司的收入。事实上，我在**微软**学到的一件事是，每当我进行国家访问时，我首先会研究的数据是，比如说在英国或瑞士，我们渠道中创造的总就业人数是多少？这曾经是我们国家报告中的头号关注点，对吧？以及总数。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: I and I I would agree with that. But **David**, since you even worked at **Microsoft** for a few years, um you you know, one of the things that I'm very grounded on is always uh that **Bill Gates** line of a **platform**, right? So, one of the things that I always think about is it's **market share**, but it's also **ecosystem effects**, right? See, what the United States always has done is not just about our market share or even um the revenues to US companies. In fact, one of the things I learned at **Microsoft** is whenever I did a country visit, the data I would first study is in let's say in the UK or in Switzerland or what have you is what is the total employment created in Switzerland uh in our channel that used to be like the number one thing uh in our country reports right and the total number

</details>

**David Saxs**: 那就像IT员工的数量，数量...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: that be like the number of IT workers the number

</details>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: 办公室员工，渠道，所以渠道合作伙伴，我们有多少ISV。所以我们曾经有一个完整的指标，衡量平台周围的生态系统是如何一个国家一个国家地建立起来的，这正是美国一直以来所做的。事实上，美国的技术栈，包括在中国，之所以能够建立起来，是因为其他人在我们的技术栈周围进行构建。同样的事情也将发生。所以这就是为什么我认为你围绕“扩散”所做的工作，是为了真正扩大蛋糕的规模，增加对平台的信任，从而带来真正的经济机会，坦率地说。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: office workers channel so channel partners we so number of ISVs uh who were there. So we used to have a complete marker of how did the ecosystem around the platform get built one country at a time and that is what the United States has always done. In fact the US tech stack including in China got built because others built around our tech stack the same thing is going to happen. So that's why I think the work you're doing around **diffusion**, right, is about really increasing the size of the pie, the trust in the platform so that there is true economic opportunity quite frankly.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 是的，你说的对，我记得这让我想起了大约十年前，我的公司**Yammer**被**微软**收购时的一些回忆。我们是**SharePoint**团队的一部分，我记得那里的产品经理非常自豪，因为**SharePoint**生态系统（即非**微软**的咨询社区、那些进入公司实施**SharePoint**的实施者）的收入，我认为大约是**微软**自身软件收入的七倍。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Well, you're right and and I remember actually you you brought back some memories from this is about a decade ago when my company **Yammer** was acquired by **Microsoft**. we were part of uh the **SharePoint** group and I remember that the um the product managers there were very proud of the fact that the revenue from the **SharePoint** ecosystem meaning non-**Microsoft** the um the consulting community the implementers who would go into companies implement **SharePoint** I think their revenue is something like seven times greater than **Microsoft**'s own software revenue and I think

</details>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: 总计。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: in aggregate

</details>

**David Saxs**: 总计。我认为**比尔·盖茨**曾说过一句话，大意是，除非你的平台之上的收入是你自身收入的某个倍数，否则你就不算是一个生态系统或平台。我认为，当我们谈论“扩散”时，这一点非常重要。我们显然希望美国拥有领先地位，但这并不意味着对世界其他地方来说是坏事，因为他们可以在这些平台之上进行构建，创造更多的价值。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: in aggregate and I think and I think **Bill** had a line about you're not an ecosystem or platform until the revenue on top of your platform is some, you know, factor of your own revenue. And and I and I think that I think what's really important about this is when we talk about **diffusion** and obviously want the United States to have this leading position, it doesn't mean it's bad for the rest of the world because they're able to build on top of those platforms and create even more value.

</details>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: 100%正确。事实上，这才是最重要的。所以这并不是关于美国科技和美国收入。它实际上是在各地利用新平台创造机会。事实上，你知道，我记得我在90年代曾从事我们的数据库产品工作，与**SAP**合作。事实上，**SQL Server**和**R3**的结合对双方都取得了成功。人们谈论了很多**Intel**和**微软**，但我成长过程中另一个对我看待世界产生基础性影响的事情是，我们与一家至今仍是巨头的欧洲软件公司所做的工作。所以，谁知道下一个大型AI应用会是什么，会在哪里发生，会发生什么。但我抱持的态度是，即使是基于美国的技术栈，全球各地也可能涌现出科技公司，甚至可能是前五名的科技公司。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: 100%. In fact, that's sort of the most important point, right? So this is not that this is not about American tech um and America revenues to the United States. It's actually creating opportunity using a new platform everywhere. And in fact you know the you know like I remember I worked on our database products uh in the '90s u you know with **SAP** in fact the combination of uh **SQL Server** and **R3** were successful on both sides. There's a lot talked about **Intel** and **Microsoft**, but one of the other things that I grew up in which has sort of been foundational in how I look at the world is what we did with a European software company that is still uh you know a giant. And so that you know who knows what the next big AI app will be and where and what will happen. But uh I I sort of go in with the attitude that there will be tech companies uh maybe even top five tech companies that could emerge everywhere with even the American tech stack.

### OpenAI合作与微软的AI模型策略

**David Saxs**: 你做了一些惊人的收购，除了作为一名技术专家，你也是一位相当出色的交易撮合者。这可能是你辉煌任期和巨大增长中最少被报道的方面。但你与**OpenAI**达成了协议，**Sam Altman**可能是史上最精明/最具争议的交易撮合者之一。这笔交易被看作是，你将获得一笔意外之财，而**微软**并不需要现金。如果他们上市，这总是好事，我猜。但你是否可能，这也是当时受到的批评，为**微软**创造了一个终极竞争对手？你如何看待这个问题？**微软**错过了**史蒂夫·鲍尔默**（Steve Ballmer）最大的遗憾——错过了移动革命，你如何才能不拥有自己的**Gemini**、**XAI**、**Claude**？或者在你看来，你已经拥有了，因为你拥有**OpenAI**的源代码？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: you have um done some amazing acquisitions and you're quite a dealmaker on top of being a technologist. It's probably the least reported aspect of your spectacular tenure and the massive growth you've had. But you did a deal with **OpenAI** and probably one of the most savvy slashcontroversial dealmakers of all time, **Sam Alman**. That deal was looked at as you you you're you're set up to get a windfall in cash which you don't need as **Microsoft**. always nice I'm guessing if they IPO but did you create potentially and this was the criticism of it an ultimate competitor to **Microsoft** and how do you think about that and how can **Microsoft** which missed **Steve Bombber**'s biggest regret missing the mobile revolution how can you not have a **Gemini** an **XAI** a **claude** that is your own or in your mind do you have that because you have the source code of **OpenAI**

</details>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: 是的，我认为这是对的。所以当人们问“你们的基础模型在哪里？”我的意思是，归根结底，我们确实拥有IP。但话虽如此，我认为你提到了几个不同的方面。首先，对我们来说，当我审视**微软**今天的战略时，最重要的一点是我们要构建“令牌工厂”。所以我们今天最大的业务是**Azure**业务，考虑到将要发生的事情，**Azure**业务的市场总额（**TAM**）是如此巨大，以至于我们现在需要非常擅长构建这些“令牌工厂”。这意味着异构的基础设施，每个超大规模提供商都一直在做的事情，那就是利用软件最大限度地利用它，以实现总拥有成本（TCO）和利用率。所以这是一方面。

然后是应用服务器业务，对吧？每个人，你谈到，如果每个人都要构建**智能体**，拥有“无限思维”，拥有这些强化学习（RL）训练场，进行评估等等，就会有一个完整的应用服务器，就像每个平台都有一个应用服务器一样，这个平台也有一个应用服务器。这就是我们正在用**Foundry**等产品做的事情。所以有一个应用服务器业务。在这个应用服务器中，现在结构上非常清楚的一点是，任何构建任何应用程序或任何公司的开发者，都不会只使用一个模型，而是会使用所有模型。对吧？我为什么不呢？事实上，对于任何给定的任务，我甚至会协调多个模型。我们医疗保健实践中有一个很好的产品叫做“决策协调器”。它证明了通过分配角色，比如调查员、数据分析师、领域专家，即使只是给模型分配提示角色，然后协调它们，也能比任何单一的前沿模型获得更好的结果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: yeah I think that that's right so when when people say uh where is your foundation model? I mean at the end of the day we do have the IP but that said I think you bring up a couple different things right one is to us the most important thing when I look at what is **Microsoft**'s uh strategy today one is we want to build **token factories** right so our biggest business today is **Azure** business and the **Azure** business the **TAM** given what's going to happen is is so huge that we now need to be fantastic uh at building these **token factories** and um that's means a heterogeneous fleet of infrastructure and that every hyperscaler has always done which is use software to make maximum use of it and for TCO and utilization. So that's one side of it. Then there's the **app server business** right which is everybody we you talked about like if everyone's going to be building agents have **infinite minds** have these RL gyms have eval what have you there's an entire just like every platform has had an app server this one has an app server that's what we're doing with **Foundry** and what have you right so there's an **app server business** in that app server one of the things that structurally now is pretty clear is anyone building any application or any company is going to use not one model but all the models Right? Why would I not? Right? Which is in fact I will orchestrate for any given task even multiple models. Right? There's this one nice thing that we came out in our healthcare practice called the **decision orchestrator**. What it proves is that by assigning roles, right? So investigator, data analyst, domain expert, just giving even prompted roles to models and then orchestrating them gets better results than any one single frontier model.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 我是否可以理解为，你对开源模型持乐观态度，并认为大型语言模型将主要被商品化，而价值不会在那里产生？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Am I right to read into that then that you're bullish on the open- source models and think large language models will largely be commoditized and that's not where the value will occur.

</details>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: 事实上，我的看法是，就像过去发生的那样...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: In fact, the way I think about it is that just like what happened

</details>

**David Saxs**: 顺便说一句，**苹果**也这么认为。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: and **Apple** thinks that too by the way.

</details>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: 顺便说一句，你如何看待数据库市场发生的事情？我以前认为一切都只是**SQL**数据库，直到它不再是。我的意思是，想想看，有文档数据库，有NoSQL数据库。数据库的激增，对吧？谁会想到数据库市场会有如此丰富的多样性？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: By the way, what the way you think about what happened in the **database market**, right? You know, I used to be like everything is just a **SQL database** until it was not, right? There was I mean, think about it. There dock databases, there is no **SQL databases**. The proliferation of databases, right? Who would have thought that the **database market** would have such a richness to it

</details>

**David Saxs**: 或者它可能永远是开源的？那是...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: or that it could ever be open source? That was

</details>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: 这是真的。我的意思是，谈到**PostgreSQL**或甚至发生的事情，它是开源的，但甚至有公司支持它。所以对我来说，这就是将要发生的事情。对我来说，一个模型就像数据库市场，它会有差异，但我总觉得，肯定会有闭源的前沿模型，也会有开源的前沿模型。事实上，如果说有什么的话，我认为在明年，讨论的一个重要部分可能是“公司的未来是什么？”一家公司应该能够将其拥有的隐性知识嵌入到他们控制的模型权重中。对吧？所以当有人问我应该有多少个模型时，我会说，世界上有多少家公司，就应该有多少个模型。对吧？这有点极端。因为对我来说，这就是我认为这个知识经济如何成为AI经济的方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: that's true. I mean talk about **Postgress** or what has happened even with which is open but there are even companies that have backed it and so so to me that's what's going to happen and to me a model is like the **database market** you know it's it's got it's going to differences but I sort of somehow think that uh it's not there are definitely going to be frontier models that are closed source you know there going to be open source models that are going to be uh uh frontier class in fact if anything I think in this next year what'll be probably a big part of the discussion is what's the future of a **firm**? A **firm** should be able to take the tacet knowledge it has and embed it inside a weights in a model that they control. Right? So when somebody asks me how many models should be there, I'll say as many models as **firms** in the world. Right? That's sort of the an extreme way. Uh because because to me that's how I think this you know this knowledge economy becomes an **AI economy**.

### 本地LLM与桌面AI

**David Saxs**: 你是否正在秘密地，你可以在这里说，因为我们都在**All-In**上，开发一个用于**Windows**桌面的LLM？因为你已经有了，就像今天有一个**Phi-2**模型，它完全驻留在本地，使用**NPU**s，当然也使用**GPU**s。事实上，最大的安装...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Are you secretly and you can say it here since we're on **allin** working on an LLM to exist on the **Windows** desktop because that you are you have it like today there's a **five silica model** which is completely resident using **NPU**s and of course using **GPU**s in fact the largest installation

</details>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: 高功率的最大安装。事实上，最令人着迷的一点是，工作站又回来了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: um of high power in fact it's one of the fascinating the workstation is back I'm one of the most if you went to see

</details>

**David Saxs**: 这对**微软**来说太棒了，因为你们有很好的桌面业务。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: which is great for **Microsoft** because you you have a nice desktop business.

</details>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: 绝对如此。所以我们，事实上，我们认为这种形式因素，特别是，我总是说，我是在命令行上开始我的职业生涯的。谁知道呢，我可能也会在命令行上结束它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: Absolutely. And so we and in fact we think that that form factor especially I mean I I always say this which is u you know I started my career on a command line. Who knows I may just end it in a command line.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 你在**Sun**公司开始工作，那是最初的5000到10000美元的工作站。你是否预见到有一天你会在这里与客户会面，并倡导一台1万到2万美元的桌面机器，它内置LLM和硬件？你可以放一张**DGX**卡，你可以拥有一台非常棒的机器和模型。顺便说一句，我们距离拥有某种分布式模型架构，甚至是一种知道如何真正分发自身的架构，只差一个架构调整。这就是那种可以完全改变“混合AI”面貌的突破。但我们绝对致力于并专注于使**PC**成为本地模型和那些可以进行大量提示处理并调用云端的本地模型的好地方。所以有很多工作可以做，这绝对正在进行中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Well you started at **Sun** which was the original 5 $10,000 workstation. Do you see a time where you'll be meeting with your customers here and advocating a 10 $20,000 desktop machine that has an LLM and the hardware? You can you can put a **DGX** card and you can have like just a fantastic machine and the models I and by the way you know we are one architecture tweak away from even having some kind of a **distributed model architecture** right even ane architecture that shows knows how to really distribute itself right that's the type of breakthrough that can completely change uh what **hybrid AI** may look like but we're absolutely committed and focused on making the **PC** a great place for local models uh and local models that then do even a lot of the prompt processing and call into the cloud, right? So there's a whole lot of work that can happen and that's sort of definitely something that's underway.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 是的，我认为**Claude Co-Work**已经展示了利用本地文件驱动器并能够使用它的力量。这又引出了另一点。你让我思考**Yammer**，对于不了解的人来说，**Yammer**大约在15年前声名鹊起，因为它开创了许多消费者增长策略来攻击企业软件。我想知道，当你思考企业对AI的采用时，你认为它在未来一年会如何传播？感觉我们正处于一个关键时刻。你认为它会是自上而下的吗？会是CEO指导团队，给他们一个战略转型项目，然后他们会进行RFP（提案请求）吗？还是你认为它会在企业中自下而上地传播，通过那些适应性强、在自己生活中使用工具、并将这些东西带到工作中并开始完成惊人成就的AI原生员工？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Yeah, I think that the **cloud co-work** has kind of shown the power of tapping into the local file drive and be able to use that. That that brings up another point. you you got me thinking about **Yammer** and for people who don't know um you know **Yammer**'s claim to fame this is about 15 years ago was that it pioneered a lot of um well it used a lot of consumer growth tactics to attack enterprise software I'm wondering as you think about enterprise adoption of AI how do you think it's going to spread over the next year it feels like we're at sort of a a a critical point do you think it's going to be top down is it going to come from the CEO directing a team giving them a strategic transformation project and they're going to do an RFP or do you think it's going to spread bottom up in the enterprise through AI native employees who are adaptable who are using the tools in their own lives and they start to bring these things to work and start accomplishing amazing things.

</details>

### AI的企业采纳与未来劳动力

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: 是的，我认为，就像所有事情一样，**David**，我认为它是自上而下和自下而上兼而有之的。我之所以说自上而下，是因为如果我审视AI在客户服务、供应链或HR自助服务中的应用投资回报率，这些都是IT和CXO可以做出决策的简单项目，你会在这些地方看到AI的首次真正采用。但自下而上才是最终会发生的事情。我的意思是，即使是PC，如果你回想一下，律师带来了Word，然后财务部门带来了**Excel**，然后电子邮件出现了，然后它就成了标准配置。这就是现在正在发生的事情。

例如，当我谈论每个人都在构建**智能体**时，这些**智能体**正在找出一种方法来创建这些改变工作流程、消除工作中繁重任务的东西。这就是自下而上转型开始的标志。事实上，我最兴奋的是这种自下而上的变化。即使在**微软**，例如，我们今天在**Azure**管理着大约500名光纤操作员。顺便说一句，我自己并没有意识到，很多时候，这被称为**DevOps**，但它是一个物理资产，东西会被切断。当你谈论**DevOps**时，这意味着你实际上是在给人们发电子邮件，询问光纤断裂发生了什么，我们如何修复它。所以有很多来回沟通。所以，运行我们全球网络的人基本上已经构建了，正如你所说的，这些**数字员工**，他们本质上正在做所有这些**DevOps**工作。所以这是一个完全自下而上的过程，你看到了工具。这有点像，“嘿，我有了构建**智能体**的新方法，它就在那里，我将用它来创建自动化级别，消除繁重任务，提高效率，提高质量。”这最终是一个技能提升的问题，这是一个大问题。技能提升并非神秘，它只是通过实践来实现的。所以，这不像我去上课，而是工具的“扩散”和工具的使用，我认为这才是真正会发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: Yeah. No, I think you know like all things **David** I think it's both the **top down bottom up** right. uh the that the reason I say that top down is if I look at the ROI uh of uh applying AI in customer service uh or in supply chain or in HR self-service those are the easy projects where uh IT and CXOs can make calls and that's where you'll see the first drop of uh real AI adoption but the **bottom up** is what ultimately will happen right I mean with even with the **PCs** in fact if you think back at the lawyers brought word in and then finance bought **Excel** in and then email came and then it became standard issue. That's what's happening right now. So for example, these agents when I sort of talk about everybody's building agents, they are figuring out a way to go create these things that are changing workflow and removing drudgery in their work. Right? That's sort of the beginning of what is a **bottomup transformation**. Um I you I was in fact the thing that I'm most excited about is this **bottomup change** even at **Microsoft** for example we manage something like 500 odd fiber operators around the world in in **Azure** today and by the way I not myself realized it a lot of it you know it's called **DevOps** but it's a it's a physical asset things get cut and when you sort of say **DevOps** that means you literally are emailing people and saying hey what happened to that fiber cut how do we repair it so there's a lot of back and forth so this network the the person who runs our global network basically has built to your point about these person they're just **digital employees** essentially that are doing all of that **devops** uh and so that's and there's a completely bottoms up uh where you see the tools it's kind of like hey I have the new way to build agents it's there I'm going to use it to create levels of automation uh that remove drudgery improve efficiency improve quality and that ultimately is a **skilling** thing which is sort of the big issue which is um and **skilling** is not mystical it's just by doing right so it's not like I go to a class per se it's like the **diffusion** of the tools uh and using the tools and that I think is what's really going to be happening

</details>

**David Saxs**: 我们正处于一个非常有趣的时刻，用这些工具赋能现有员工比招聘、指导和培养下一代要容易得多。所以感觉我们正处于一个消化不良的时刻。在**微软**，你认为如果公司规模保持不变，谁会在30或40年后接替你的工作？因为考虑到你技术优先的方法，按照这种速度，似乎没有理由再增加**微软**员工，而且你已经四年没有增加了。你可能进行了一些人员调整和结构变化。那么，你如何看待下一代？你对那些现在可能没有**微软**工作机会的大学毕业生有什么建议？你曾经花很多时间建立这个群体，但现在你可能没有那种奢侈了。你有没有想过这个问题？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: and and we're in a very interesting moment empowering an existing employee with these tools is so much easier than hiring and mentoring and bringing up the next generation so it feels like we're in a little bit of an indigestion moment at **Microsoft**, do you think who's going to have my job in 30 or 40 years, if the company stays the same size? Because given your technology first approach, there's really no reason to ever add another **Microsoft** employee at the pace this is going and you haven't for four years. So, how you may have swapped some in and out and changed the texture of it. So, how do you think about maybe this next generation? What advice would you have for these college graduates who maybe don't have an offer for **Microsoft** right now? And you used to spend a lot of time on that building that group, but maybe you don't have that luxury now. Do you think about it ever?

</details>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: 不，我的意思是，这是一个很好的问题。你知道，关于职业早期和大学招聘会发生什么，有一些争论。我仍然坚信大学招聘，因为归根结底，这将改变任何人掌握代码库熟练度的曲线。假设只是常规的CS招聘，变化的是，对于一个新加入团队的人来说，由于所有的Markdown、技能以及我可以去问**智能体**的事实，他们能够更快地适应。我的意思是，想想看，这就像有一个令人难以置信的导师，让你更快地融入代码库。所以在某种意义上，大学毕业生的生产力曲线将比以往任何时候都更陡峭。所以我想可能会有所不同。事实上，我们正在尝试的一种是不同类型的学徒制，即你找一个IC高级开发人员，让他们带领一群大学毕业生，因为这是一种新的工作方式。我记得，所有加入**微软**的人都会说，“**Cutler**是如何实现**Malik**的？”或者类似的问题，他们会去阅读他的代码，以理解什么是伟大的工艺。现在，我认为这种伟大的工艺是通过观察10倍甚至100倍工程师如何使用AI来构建高质量产品而获得的。这就是这些新的大学毕业生将学习并更快学习的东西。所以这对我们这样的公司来说是一件有益的事情，因为归根结底，除非我们看到长寿或类似的东西，否则我们需要人们进入劳动力市场，在**微软**取得成功。所以我们非常致力于此，但我们也在确保工作范围与当前劳动力和即将进入劳动力市场的人们的抱负相符。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**萨蒂亚·纳德拉**: No, I I mean it's a great question. I you know there's a little bit of a debate what happens to early in career and how is college recruiting. I still am a big believer in uh college recruiting because at the end of the day um this is going to change the curve by which anyone can pick up proficiency in a codebase. Let's just it takes sort of just regular CS hiring. uh what has changed is perhaps for someone who comes in new into a team and to be able to ramp up thanks to all of uh the markdowns, the skills, uh the fact that I can go ask the agent. I mean, think about it, right? It's like having an unbelievable mentor who is getting you onboarded onto a codebase faster. So in some sense the **productivity curve** uh of a college hire is going to be much steeper than it ever before. So I think there might be a difference. In fact, one of the things we're experimenting with is a different type of **apprenticeship**, right? Which is you take somebody who's an IC senior dev have like a cohort of college uh hires working with them because it's a new way of working. It's like I remember like all you know everybody who joined **Microsoft** would say go how how did you know whatever um **Cutler** implement **Malik** or what have you right he would go try to read uh his code to understand uh what great craftsmanship looks like nowadays I think that great craftsmanship uh comes by looking at even how the 10x 100x engineers use AI to build great quality products uh and that is what these new college grads will learn and learn faster and so that's a beneficial thing for a company like us because at the end of the day you know until we saw longevity or something we need people to come into the workforce be successful at **Microsoft** so we are very committed but we are also making sure that the scopes of the jobs make sense for what the aspirations of people are going to be both who are currently in the workforce and people who are entering the workforce.
