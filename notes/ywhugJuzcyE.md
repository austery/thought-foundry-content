title: Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev：让每个人都成为所有者，打造普惠金融的未来
---

### 引言：所有权经济与信息噪音
几个月前我发表了一个声明，我认为**预测市场**（Prediction Markets: 允许参与者就未来事件结果进行交易的市场）是真相机器。我们不断被各种信息和噪音轰炸。任何人都可以成为网红，任何人都可以拥有播客。你如何筛选这些信息，找出真正会发生什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I came out with a statement a couple months ago about how I think prediction markets are truth machines. Like we're constantly being bombarded by all this information and noise. Anyone can be an influencer. Anyone can have a podcast. How do you sift through that and figure out what's actually going to happen?</p>
</details>

>> 马萨诸塞州曾禁止其居民购买苹果公司的 **IPO**（Initial Public Offering: 首次公开募股）股票。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Massachusetts banned their residents from buying into the IPO of Apple. Yeah.</p>
</details>

>> 因为它风险太高了。其他 49 个州都没问题，没有那种“保姆式国家”的干预，但马萨诸塞州不行，太危险了。而苹果的股价大概上涨了 10%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Because it was too risky. 49 other like states, you're okay. Like no nanny state there, but Massachusetts, uh-uh, too dangerous. And like Apple's gone up in like 10%.</p>
</details>

>> 顺便说一句，他们同时还拥有规模最大、最健全的州立彩票之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And by the way, they have like one of the largest and most robust state lotteries at the same time,</p>
</details>

>> 这简直太疯狂了。有一个有趣的网站叫“1971 年到底发生了什么”，那一年我们脱离了**金本位制**（Gold Standard: 一种以黄金为本位货币的货币制度）。工资水平基本停滞，但资产价格却大幅上涨。如果你拥有资产，那很棒。你可以从所有这些惊人的新事物中受益，比如 iPhone，对吧？你现在是一个所有者，你参与了所有权经济。如果你只拿现金工资，即使有些人拿的现金很多，他们也只会被甩在后面。我认为我们学到了很多宝贵的教训。一个简单的谎言远比一个复杂的真相更有力量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> which is which is so bonkers. There's a funny website called uh WTF happened in 1971 when you decoupled from the gold standard. Wages were kind of stagnant, but asset prices went up a lot. If you own an asset, that's great. You benefit from all of these amazing new things like the iPhone, right? Like you're now an owner. You participate in the ownership economy. If you just get paid cash, and some people get paid a lot of cash, they just get left behind. I think we learned a lot of valuable lessons. A simple lie is much more powerful than a complicated trigger.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，比如“Robinhood 与对冲基金勾结”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So yeah, the Robin Hood's colluding with hedge funds, right?</p>
</details>

>> 这是一个非常引人入胜的故事。就好像，“啊，Robinhood，看，他们实际上是在劫贫济富”，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> It's very compelling story. It's like, ah, Robin Hood, look, they're actually stealing from the poor and giving to the rich, right?</p>
</details>

>> 这个故事简直不言自明。如果我负责竞争对手的市场营销，我可能也会想出这样的说辞，对吧？这会是个好点子。如果你把人工智能（AI）看作一个类别，你会发现它拥有历史上最快的产品普及速度。但与此同时，它也是最受憎恨的类别。你去采访人们，他们对 AI 的看法比对社交媒体还差，因为没人担心社交媒体会抢走他们的工作。但人们内心深处有一种恐惧，认为这些公司正在自动化一切，而“我的工作在那个列表的什么位置？”人们对此感到恐慌。我认为我们可以找到一种在所有权方面更平等的方式。它不应该只被一小部分**风险投资家**（Venture Capitalists, VCs: 投资于初创企业和小型企业的投资者）所拥有。事实上，我们应该确保有办法将其分配出去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> It just writes itself. Like if I was in charge of marketing for a a competitor, I'd probably come up with that, right? It would be a good one. If you look at AI as a category, you have the fastest product adoption of any products in history. And at the same time, it's the most hated category. Interview people and their perception of AI is worse than social media because nobody's worried social media is going to take their jobs. But there's this underlying fear that these companies are automating everything and you know, where's my job in that list? People are freaked out about that. And I think we could figure out how to be a little bit more egalitarian in the ownership. Like it shouldn't just be owned by a small fraction of of VCs. In fact, we should make sure that there's ways to distribute it.</p>

### Robinhood 的独特之处：有机增长与产品驱动
>> Vlad，欢迎来到我们的播客。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Vlad, welcome to the podcast.</p>
</details>

很高兴能和各位交流。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> It it's a pleasure to join you gentlemen.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。Alex，我们 a16z 从种子轮到后期，在 Robinhood 发展的各个阶段都进行了投资。Alex，你为什么不分享一下，为什么即使经历了高潮和低谷，你仍然持续认为 Robinhood 是一家如此引人注目的公司？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Um, Alex, so we at ACZ, we've uh invested in Robin Hood from seed to, you know, much later stage at various stages of the of the of the company. Alex, why don't you just give some perspective on why you've continuously found Robin Hood to be such a compelling company even through the highs and lows?</p>
</details>

>> 嗯，我真的不能把种子轮的功劳归于自己，原因有二。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, I really can't take credit for the seed for two reasons. Numbered you.</p>
</details>

>> 没错。第一……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Exactly. Number one,</p>
</details>

>> Johnny Conway。第一，那是在我之前。第二，当时的情况就像是“你也能拿到钱”，有点像奥普拉·温弗瑞的“你也能得到一辆车”。那时候我们在种子轮投资了很多公司，因为金额很小。再说一次，我很想揽功，说……我记得我们投资的时候，作为一个局外人，我其实并不理解。但事实证明，有一点我要说，金融服务公司非常非常少。第一，因为建立金融关系与拥有一个 Pinterest 看板大不相同。我不是针对 Pinterest，或者拥有一个 Facebook 账户，而是说，真正把你的金融生活和钱托付给某人。这是一种更高层次的承诺，就像是同居的男女朋友那样。门槛更高了。第二，很少有公司能获得真正的有机增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Johnny Conway. Number one, it predated. And then number two, it was just like you get money. It's like the Oprah Winfrey like you get a car. It was a little bit of like we just invested in a lot of companies back then at see because it was a small amount of money. Again, I I would love to take credit and say um so I remember we invested um and I didn't really get it as an outsider. Um but it turns out like here here's one thing that I'll say um there are very very few financial services companies number one because having a financial relationship is a lot different than having like a Pinterest board. Nothing against Pinterest, right? or having like a Facebook account, but like really trusting somebody with your financial life and money. That's a higher level of commitment for that's like the the live-in girlfriend or boyfriend kind of thing. It's like you're you're like the bar is up higher for that. And then number two, it's very rare to see companies that just get organic traction. Yeah.</p>
</details>

>> 所以，我喜欢说，尤其是在金融服务领域，建立关系的门槛很高，你或许应该直接买谷歌或 Facebook 的股票，而不是投资大多数公司。因为所有的钱最终都流向了那里。就像你融了 A 轮或 C 轮，然后你会想，“哦，糟了，我需要获取用户。”然后你就把所有的钱都花在谷歌广告上。最后你没钱了，谷歌赚得盆满钵满，谷歌赢了，你输了。我想说，Robinhood，你显然比我更了解这个故事。但很少有公司能真正以一种非常有意义的方式破解有机分销的密码。而 Robinhood 可能是其中最成功的一个。所以，我知道这并不是想作弊。还有围绕产品建立的其他一切。我和 Eric 事先讨论过的另一件事是，金融界有很多非常聪明的人，但他们不进入“产品金融”领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, I like to say, especially in financial services with that high bar to having a relationship, uh you should probably just buy Google stock or Facebook stock versus investing in most companies because like that's where all the money goes. It's like you like you raise an A round or a C round, you're like, "Oh, shoot. I need to get users." And then you just spend like all of your money on Google ads. And then you have no more money left. Google has lots of money and then Google wins and you lose. And I would say like Robin Hood, I mean, you obviously know the story so much better than I do. But there were very very few companies that really figured out how to hack organic distribution in a very meaningful way. Um, and Robin Hood is probably the most successful of of them all. And so that that I mean I I know that that's not meant to cheat. and everything else that has been built around the product. I mean, the other thing that Eric and I were talking about in advance, which is a lot of really smart people in finance go into finance, but they don't go into like product finance.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

>> 他们会想，“我要去一家**高频交易**（High-frequency trading, HFT: 利用强大计算机系统进行极速交易的策略）公司工作，赚大钱”，而不是“我了解一切运作的方式，我要免费获取客户，我要打造一个好一千倍的产品，然后我要主宰世界。”而你们三样都做到了。所以，我认为 Robinhood 非常独特。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, it's like, I'm going to go to work at a high frequency trading firm and make lots of money as opposed to I understand the way that everything works. I'm going to get customers for free. I'm going to build a thousand times better product and I'm going to dominate the world. And you've kind of done all three. So, that's why I think Robin Hood's pretty unique.</p>
</details>

### 创业之初：在怀疑声中开创金融科技
是的，我认为当我们刚开始时，**金融科技**（Fintech: Financial Technology的缩写，指利用科技手段革新金融服务）这个类别还不存在。你可以看看谷歌趋势，在 a16z 进行种子投资的时候，大概是 2013 年中，没人真正在谈论金融科技。我们得到的批评是，你们正在进入一个受监管的领域，你们还没有拿到牌照。存在很多不确定性，我们当时陷入了一种**第22条军规**（Catch-22: 源自同名小说，指一种无论如何选择都无法摆脱的困境）的境地，一方面是我们能否拿到牌照存在不确定性，另一方面监管机构又希望我们有钱，这让事情变得非常非常困难。他们不希望一家券商在一年后就带着客户倒闭。所以我们处在这种困境中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. I think when we got started uh fintech as a category didn't really exist. I mean you can look at the Google trends uh and around the time A16Z made their seed investment which I think was 2013 mid 2013 nobody was really talking about fintech right and the criticism we would get is well you know you're you're entering a regulated space you don't have your license yet um there was a lot of uncertainty and we were kind of in this catch22 situation where you there was uncertainty about whether we would get the license and also um the regulators wanted us to have money which made it very very difficult you know they they don't want a brokerage to go out of business after one year with customers so we were in this catch22 situation and juxtapose that against the climate which was just</p>
</details>

>> 当时人们普遍怀疑是否会有人愿意进行交易。很多投资者也相信，**交易所交易基金**（ETFs: Exchange-Traded Funds 的缩写，是一种在证券交易所交易，追踪特定指数的基金）和指数化投资已经颠覆并吞噬了消费者投资领域。所以，我们有一个强烈的观点，认为情况并非如此，实际上人们只是缺少好的工具。但除了亲手去做并证明它可行之外，没有别的方法来证明这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> there was skepticism that people would want to trade like there there was this belief by a lot of investors too that ETFs and indexing had kind of disrupted and eaten the consumer investing landscape. And so, you know, we we had a strong point of view that that wasn't the case and that actually people were just missing good tools. Um, but there was no way to demonstrate that besides just doing it and showing that, you know, it could be done.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。我记得 Wealthfront，如果你了解 Wealthfront 的历史……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. I mean, I the I remember Wealthfront, if you know the history of Wealthfront,</p>
</details>

>> 哦，是的。它最初是一个叫 Kaching 的网站。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Oh, yeah. It started off as a site called Kaching.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

>> 你知道这个，对吧？Kaching 是一个很棒的想法，但超前了时代。Andy Rachleff 创办了这家公司，因为我记得他当时在宾夕法尼亚大学的董事会，他们有很多公开的对冲基金经理，做多做空的公司，表现都优于市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> You know this, right? So Kaching was kind of a brilliant idea that was ahead of its time which was there. So Andy Rackliff started this company because I think he was on the board of Penn uh University of Pennsylvania and they had all of these public hedge fund money managers, long short firms that would outperform the market.</p>
</details>

>> 为什么不能将这种能力大众化呢？有两个方面。第一，也许 Eric 是一个了不起的基金经理，但从未得到管理基金的机会。第二，如果他有一个很棒的基金，为什么不让街上的普通人也来投资他，模仿他的交易呢？这就是 Wealthfront 最初的想法，非常非常积极，相信人们可以战胜市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And why can't you democratize that? And twofold. One is maybe Eric is an amazing money manager but never got handed a fund. Um, and then number two is if he has a great fund, why not let other people just off the street go invest with him and kind of copy their trades? And that was the original idea of Wealthfront was really kind of very very active like believing that people could beat the market.</p>
</details>

>> 然后出于各种原因，它转型成了……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Um, and then for a variety of reasons that pivoted into like being</p>
</details>

>> 完全相反的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> the exact opposite.</p>
</details>

>> 完全相反。是的，这很有趣，因为它变得高度同质化了。因为有很多其他人也会说，我也可以为你做被动指数化投资。相比之下，建立一个网络来发现那些未被发掘的人才，然后让任何人都能将资金投入到这些围绕主动投资的未被发掘的人才背后，这实际上是一个相当革命性的想法，可能只是超前了时代，或者我不知道，也许它本来就不可行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> The exact opposite. Yes. which which is quite funny which is which is highly commoditized because there are so many other I mean Wealthfront's doing very very well but there are so many other people that will say I will do passive indexing for you as well versus the idea of having a network for finding this undiscovered talent and then allowing anybody to put money behind the undiscovered talent around active investing like that was actually a pretty revolutionary idea that probably just was ahead of its time or I don't know maybe it wasn't</p>
</details>

### Robinhood 成功的三大支柱
我认为 Robinhood 同时做了三件具有挑战性的事情，这帮助我们取得了成功。第一件事是，我们从一开始就有一个非常简单的价值主张。当时其他所有人对一笔股票交易收费 7 到 10 美元，我们做到了零。我们在三到四年的时间里基本独享了这个优势，直到现有的大公司赶上来，不得不复制我们的模式，因为他们注意到自己正在加速流失客户。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think Robin Hood did three simult simultaneously challenging things uh that helped make us successful. I think the first thing was we actually had a pretty simple value prop from the very beginning. You know, everyone else was charging $7 to $10 for a stock trade. we went to zero and we had that basically to ourselves for a period of three to four years before the the incumbents kind of caught up and had to replicate that because they noticed they were losing all their customers and it was accelerating.</p>
</details>

>> 这是其一，背后需要大量的技术支持，要建立一个能够可持续实现这一点的业务并非易事。第二是搞定移动端。在我们创业时，这实际上是逆势而为，因为你交谈的大多数人都在手机上玩游戏。想象一个你的手机成为你主要金融设备的世界，这在当时有点跳跃。但我记得一件事，我在高中的时候，对在亚马逊上买东西很感兴趣，而我的父母就会说，“你怎么能把你的信用卡信息输入电脑呢，会被黑客攻击的。”这简直是昨日重现。当我和人们谈论在手机上交易股票时，得到的反馈也是一样的，比如“你怎么能把你的财务托付给这个设备？它这么小。如果被黑了怎么办？如果你弄丢了怎么办？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So that was one and there was a lot of technology and just it it was it it wasn't trivial to actually build a business that could make that happen sustainably. The second was figuring out mobile and you know when we started this was actually contrarian because most people that you talk to were playing games on their phones, right? And it was a little bit of a leap to imagine a world where your your phone is your primary financial device. But I remembered something which was that when I was in high school, I was like interested in buying stuff on Amazon and my parents were just like, yeah, how could you put your credit card onto the computer, you know, it's going to get hacked and it was just deja vu. When I would talk to people about, you know, trading stocks on on their phone, it was the same sort of feedback, like how could you how could you trust your finances with this device? It's it's so small. What if it gets hacked? What if you lose it?</p>
</details>

>> 所以这在当时听起来不合逻辑。我们当时就赌了一把，认为移动端会成为主流，因为它有很多优势。很多人在工作日进行交易，你不能真的把你的投资信息放在工作电脑上，这有点禁忌。所以你可以随身携带这个设备，确保在市场波动时能随时掌握情况。然后我认为第三件事是品牌。我相信你们都听过彼得·蒂尔说过，公司的名字非常重要，对吧？他把 Uber 这个名字和 Airbnb 对比，Uber 听起来就像一个会被监管审查狠狠打击的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, it just didn't make sense. So, we we kind of made a bet that that would actually be primary cuz there's so many advantages. A lot of people trade during the working day. You can't really have your investments on your work computer. It's a little taboo. So you can just have this device with you to make sure you're on top of things when things are moving. And then I think the third thing was actually the brand. And um I'm sure you guys have heard Peter Teal say this thing that you know the name of a company is very important, right? you know, he juxtaposed sort of like Uber the name and it's like h it just sounds like this company that's going to get slammed hard by regulatory scrutiny</p>
</details>

>> 而 Airbnb 听起来则轻盈飘逸，他们可能会过得轻松得多。在金融危机之后，人们对金融业普遍感到幻灭，而我正是在那个时候进入我的职业生涯。我 2008 年从斯坦福毕业，在雷曼兄弟倒闭前一个月开始了研究生学习。我记得我很多找到第一份工作的朋友，有些人感到非常安稳。那些通过雷曼兄弟实习拿到正式录用通知的人，他们觉得，“我稳了。我知道我未来十年会是什么样子。我会在这里工作两年，然后可能去读个 MBA，然后转到另一个助理职位，一步步往上爬。”但那些感觉最安稳的人，却是第一批收拾纸箱离开工位的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> versus Airbnb which sounds like this light airy like they'll probably have a much easier time. Um but yeah, there was this whole um disillusionment with finances in the wake of the financial crisis which is basically when I entered my professional career. You know, I I graduated Stanford 2008 and started grad school uh a month before Lehman Brothers went under. And I remember a lot of my friends who were taking their first jobs, some of them felt very secure. You know, the the ones that had their Lehman Brothers internship leading to a Lehman Brothers return offer, they were like, I'm set. You know, I know what my next 10 years is going to be like. I'm going to work here for two years. is then I might go get an MBA and then, you know, I'll transition to this other, you know, associate role and work my way up. But, but I'm good. The ones that felt the most secure were the first ones to be packing up their cubicles and those cardboard boxes. Um,</p>
</details>

>> 不仅如此，很多人，尤其是在我的圈子里，金融服务曾是热门专业。当时你想进入这个行业，那是在计算机科学火起来之前。由于他们无法理解和控制的外部力量，不仅是他们自己的工作，还有他们父母、家人的工作都受到了影响。然后我认识的很多研究生和大学同学实际上参加了“占领”抗议活动。这为新品牌的诞生奠定了基础。人们对现状感到幻灭，他们认为金融体系不是为他们服务的。我认为在很多方面，Robinhood 是一个实际的解决方案。我们知道这个系统是有效的，我们不能 просто把它烧掉，那样做可能会非常危险。但如果你能让它为更多人服务……我们通过品牌，用一个简单的信息提供了这一点。我认为，这一点，加上移动端，加上免佣金以及实现这一切的技术，让我们得以迅速成长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> so, and not just that, but a lot of people, especially in my circle, you know, financial services was like the hot major. You wanted to get into the industry back then. It was pre computer science. and you know by by forces outside of their comprehension and control uh not just their own jobs but their parents, their family members and and then a lot of the folks that I knew in grad school and in college actually participated in these Occupy protests. So this kind of set the stage for a new brand and people were disillusioned with the state of affairs. they thought that the financial system didn't work for them and and I think in many ways Robin Hood was um the practical solution. you know what we know that it works and we can't just burn the system down and doing so would probably be quite dangerous but if you can make it work for more people um we sort of offered that in in a simple message with the brand and I think that along with mobile along with commission free and the technology that enabled that uh allowed us to grow very quickly</p>
</details>

### 零佣金的诞生：一个无需辩论的决定
>> 但我想象要达到这三点，肯定经历了一些曲折，它们就像嵌套的 if 语句，最终都成真了。但最初的起源是什么？比如，你们决定创办一家公司，最初的版本是什么样的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> but I imagine there was some meandering to kind of get to all three of those those almost like nested if state like they all they all turned out to be true but what what was the I think we should know this what was the origin like you decide to start a company like what was Vzero</p>
</details>

最初的版本是，我们之前在做一家公司，是一家为对冲基金和银行提供高频交易软件的软件公司。我们在那里注意到了两件事。一是我们的客户每天交易量巨大，数十亿美元的交易额，但支付的费用基本为零。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> well so Vzero was we we were working on a previous company which was a software firm that provided highfrequency trading software to hedge funds and banks and what we noticed there well well two things one was our customers were trading many yards a day, many you know billions of dollars of trading volume and pay paying basically nothing.</p>
</details>

整个行业已经从那种依赖人力的交易大厅模式——在那里块头最大的橄榄球运动员会有优势——转变为一种大规模的、几乎像呼叫中心的模式。然后，高频交易颠覆了机构交易市场，因为突然之间，两个来自麻省理工或斯坦福的人，在我们的案例中，只要会写代码，就能颠覆一切，并以十分之一或百分之一的成本运营一个极其复杂的交易部门。所以我们看到了这种情况在机构领域上演，并开始思考，我们能否将为机构创建的软件，让任何人都能创建交易算法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So uh and the entire industry had moved from kind of this heavy in-person trading pit model where the biggest kind of football players would have an advantage to this massive almost like call center situation and and then you had high frequency disrupt this institutional trading market because suddenly two guys out of MIT or Stanford in our case who could just write code could just disrupt everything and and run the trading book of an extremely sophisticated operation at basically onetenth or 1/100th of the cost. And so we kind of saw this playing out in institutional and we started thinking about okay can we take this software that we've created for institutions and make it so that anyone can create a trading algorithm.</p>
</details>

所以那里萌生了一个想法的种子。然后我们尝试了免费这个想法，并且没看到不这么做的理由。与此同时，我从我们前一家公司所在的纽约搬到了旧金山，开设西海岸的工程办公室。原因是我们根本在纽约招不到工程师。好的工程师都在为高频交易公司工作。我们有一个优势，就是我们毕业于斯坦福，所以我们与那里的社区有联系，我们会去招聘会。所以我们说，与其说服我们的斯坦福朋友搬到纽约，为什么我们不直接开设一个工程办公室，实现东西海岸办公呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh so so there was a seed of an idea there and and then we kind of played around with the idea of making it free and we didn't see a reason not to do it and simultaneously I had moved from New York which is where our previous company was based to San Francisco to start the West Coast Engineering Office and and the reason for that was we just couldn't hire engineers in New York. I mean they were all working the good ones were working for high frequency firms and and we had this one angle which was we went to Stanford so we were kind of plugged into the community there and we would go to the career fairs so we said okay why don't we rather than trying to convince our Stanford friends to move to New York why don't we just open up our engineering office and and be by coastal</p>

当我搬回旧金山时，大约是 Uber 在旧金山推出黑车服务、Instagram 刚刚起步的时候。所以你可以看出移动端将成为一件大事，但它还没有被均匀地分布。尽管当时距离应用商店的创建可能已经有 4 年了。我想我们只是把这两个想法结合在了一起。我们在正确的时间把它们结合起来，我认为它们最终被证明是正确的。期间有一些曲折，但我想，虽然我们可能有些地方可以做得更好，但愿景一直很清晰，那就是我们只想在移动端提供免费的股票交易。

<p class="english-text">and when I moved back to San Francisco it was around the same time that Uber had launched black car uh up in SF Instagram had just gotten started. So, you could tell that mobile was going to be a big thing, but it was not yet evenly distributed, right? Even though it was probably like, you know, 4 years since the the creation of the app store. And I think we just put these two ideas together. We put them together at the right time and I think they ended up being correct. And there was a little bit of meandering. Um, but I I think the and there were probably things we could have done better, but the vision was pretty consistent, which is we just wanted to offer free stock trading on mobile.</p>
</details>

>> 你们有没有争论过，为什么不收费一美元？当时是不是一直很明显，免费是最具颠覆性的，即使任何价格都比 Schwab 便宜？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> John, did did you ever debate just like why not make it a dollar? I mean, was it kind of like always obvious at the time like free is the most disruptive even though anything would be cheaper than Schwab or like it's kind of</p>
</details>

>> 是的，你们是从一开始就拥抱“零”这个概念，还是对这个决定有过辩论？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. You kind of embraced the zero from the very beginning or did you debate that decision?</p>
</details>

我们没有辩论过那个决定。是的，基本上有两个定价决定是 Beiju 和我在我们红木城办公室的午餐桌上做出的。零佣金的决定几乎是在这个想法诞生之初就有了。我们当时想，“哦，如果我们真的把它做成免费的呢？”那将会非常非常有力量。所以那个决定几乎没有变过，因为我认为我们直觉上很清楚，免费在市场上会更有力，比 99 美分甚至 1 美元都更有吸引力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> We didn't debate that decision. Um yeah, there were basically two pricing decisions that uh Beiju and I made at the the lunch table in our Redwood City offices. Um well actually the the the zero commissions decision was almost there at the genesis of this idea. We're like oh well what if we actually made it free? Um that would be very very powerful. So it was almost like that one didn't change because I think it was intuitively clear to us that free would be much stronger to market like it would be a much better hook than even 99 cents or $1.</p>
</details>

有一个我们需要做的决定是关于账户最低限额。这个就有点复杂了，因为当时大多数券商都有某种形式的账户最低限额。你必须存入 2000 美元才能开户，这是一个很常见的门槛。我们当时想，支持设置门槛的理由是，如果你有一堆账户里只有 5 美分的人，服务他们会产生成本，你可能永远也赚不到钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh there was a a decision that we had to make about account minimums. And this one was a little bit more complicated because most brokerages at the time had some sort of account minimum. You had to put in $2,000. That was a pretty common one to open up an account. And we were like, well, the the argument for it is if you have a bunch of people with 5 cents in their account, it's going to cost you some amount to service them and you'll probably never make any money.</p>
</details>

但是，赚钱在当时还很遥远。那不是我们近期的考虑。我们只是想让产品能用起来。我们赌了一把，嘿，我们就把它设为零，看看会发生什么，问题以后再解决。我记得当时想，如果有什么好处的话，这应该能迫使我们真正审视我们的服务成本，确保我们运营精简，并且自动化流程，因为你别无选择，对吧？你的账户服务成本必须足够低，才能处理这些只有五美分的账户而不会破坏你的商业模式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But uh yeah, making money was pretty pretty far. Uh it wasn't it wasn't a near-term consideration at that point. We just wanted to get something to work. And we made the bet that hey, let's just let's just set it at zero, see what happens, you know, solve the problems later. And I remember thinking, well, if anything, this should force us to look at our cost of servicing and make sure we're running a tight ship and we're automating things because you just can't get away with it, right? like your cost of servicing an account has to be low enough that you can handle these, you know, five-cent accounts without just breaking your model.</p>

正是。是的。那一轮融资本身……我是说，融资是好的部分。我对整个事件的记忆是相当负面的。所以我们称之为“1 月 28 日”，因为对我们来说，那不是“哦，我们有了一次很棒的融资经历”。我们基本上记得所有严重事件的日期，所有的大危机。对我们来说，那就像……

>> 但我当时在一家大型高频交易公司 KCG 的董事会，你知道的。它之前是 Knight Capital，也曾有过自己的小交易问题。但我当时非常非常有信心。

<p class="english-text">>> Um, but I um there was I I was on I mean, you know this, but I was on the board of a large high frequency trading company called KCG.

</details>

>> 不，不是那个。是代码出了问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> No, it wasn't that. It was bad code. Mhm.</p>
</你> Knight Capital 遇到的问题是，他们不断地……你知道，如果你以特定价格下一个订单，对于券商客户来说，你会得到市价单，一切正常。但如果你是一个成熟的投资者或交易公司，人们会……这是一个对抗性的过程。所以他们不断地说，有一个无限循环，我们会把价值 50 美元的东西以 5 美元卖出。你猜怎么着，人们……在 5 分钟内，公司就完全耗尽了资本。这是一家大型上市公司，后来被 Getco 拯救了，如果你还记得 Getco，它是最早的高频交易公司之一，然后它变成了 KCG。所以 Knight Capital 和 Getco 合并了。但因此，我非常了解 **Reg NMS**（Regulation National Market System: 美国证券交易委员会旨在改善美国股票市场公平性和效率的一套规则）以及做市和**订单流支付**（Payment for order flow: 券商将客户订单发送给特定做市商执行以换取报酬的做法）是如何运作的，以及为什么它实际上不像听起来那么可怕，因为它是在内部消化交易。通常你会把交易单发到交易所，但如果我同时看到买单和卖单，并且可以当场撮合它们，你实际上可以给客户提供比在交易所更好的价格。所以我当时非常非常有信心，这个商业模式是好的。清算所的模式是愚蠢的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, Night Capital had this issue where they kept, you know, if you post an order at a particular price, like there's not really, I mean, for a brokerage customer, like you're going to get the market order, everything out, but if you are a sophisticated investor or trading company, you people will just, it's kind of an adversarial process. So, they kept saying, uh, there was like this infinite loop of we'll sell something that's like $50, we'll sell it for 5. And guess what people like in 5 minutes the company completely ran out of capital. Um and this was a large public company and then it was rescued by Gecko if you remember Gecko which was one of the original high frequency trading companies and then that became KCG. So, Night Capital Get this merger, but I as a consequence to this, I understood Regge NMS pretty well, um, and how marketmaking works and how payment for order flow works and why it's actually not like it sounds like this scary thing, but it's not because you're internalizing trades. Like, normally you would post a trade to an exchange, but if I see the buy and the sell and I can kind of match them on the spot, you can actually offer the customer a better price than if it showed up on the exchange. So I was just very very confident that the business model was a good one. Um the clearing house model was stupid.</p>
</details>

>> 给你点背景信息，大概在 1970 年代，我们是 **T+5 结算**（T+5 Settlement: 指交易日后的第五天完成资金和证券的交割）。需要 5 天，因为如果我从你这里买股票，并不是我一下单我就拥有了股票，你拥有了现金。它看起来是那样的，对吧？看起来我有了股票，你有了现金，但实际上需要 5 天才能正式结算。然后变成了 T+3，那大概是十年后的事了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And to give you context on this um like I think in the 1970s we were at T+5 clearing. It took 5 days because if I buy a stock from you, right? It's not like as soon as I put that order in like I own the stock, you have the cash. It looks like that, right? It's like it looks like I have the stock. It looks like you have the cash, but actually it takes 5 days for that to formally settle. And then it went to like T+ 3. That happened like after a decade. Yeah.</p>
</details>

>> 然后变成了 T+2。现在我们是 T+1。

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Then it went to T+2. Now we're at T+1.</p>

<p class="english-text">>> But it's just kind of comical how long it takes um to settle a trade, which I think is a great way to talk about tokenization a bit.</p>

顺便说一句，如果不是我推动 T+0，它就不会变成 T+1。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And by the way, it wouldn't have gone to T+1 if I hadn't pushed for T plus Z.</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, it should be T plus like it it's just this absurdity. And then because there is risk,</p>
</details>

那是整个 GameStop 事件带来的一个好的积极后果。他们采纳了我缩短结算时间的政策提议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> that was one good positive consequence of the whole GameStop fiasco. They they went behind my policy proposal to shorten settlement times.</p>
</details>

>> 但这件事之所以荒谬，而且向不了解的人解释起来很复杂，是因为我要卖给你股票，你要给我现金，但在那一天、两天、三天或五天里，股票的价值可能会发生很大变化。所以除了说我要给你股票，这是我的股票凭证之外，我还必须为此提供抵押品。你看到的成功越多，你必须提供的抵押品就越多。但这有点傻，因为你已经有了底层的现金或股票。这才是完全没有道理的部分，对吧？我的意思是，清算所就是这样运作的。但不存在偿付能力问题，对吧？没有……就像……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> But but the reason why this is ridiculous and it's it's again it's complicated to explain to people that don't get this. But I am going to sell you stock, you're going to give me cash, but the value of the stock can change a lot in those one or two or three or five days. So beyond just saying I'm going to give you the stock and here's here's my stock certificate, I have to post collateral for that as well. And the more success that that you see, the more collateral you have to post. But it's kind of dumb because it's all you have the underlying cash or the you have the underlying stock. And that was the part that just didn't make any sense, right? Um I mean it it's how the clearing houses function. But there was no solveny issue, right? There was no it's like</p>

>> 而不是有什么问题。这不像，你知道，我创办了一家公司，我们遇到了危机，我称之为 2020 年 3 月的危机，想象一下，当每个人都失业时，你是一家面向消费者的贷款公司，这意味着他们未来不会购买，过去也不会偿还贷款。所以那看起来就像是游戏结束了。我们在新冠疫情刚开始时为一家公司进行了一轮紧急融资，因为情况是，没人会付账单了，而我们对此负有责任，然后没人会买东西，那将是灾难性的。但那是商业模式的真正问题，当每个人都失业时。而当人们在交易，处理抵押品的方式有点傻时，那是可以解决的。所以那基本上是我的分析。你可能有一个更贴近实际的分析，比如“哦，哇，这是糟糕的一天。”是的。但实际上，Micky Malka 是我非常亲密的朋友，我非常爱他。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Um versus anything that was wrong. It's not like, you know, I started a firm and we had a crisis, uh I would call it the March of 2020 crisis where imagine being a lending company to consumers when everybody loses their job, right? Which means that they're not going to buy in the future and they're not going to pay off their loans in the past. So that seemed like cat like game over. Like we had an emergency round for a firm right around the same like right around like the beginning of COVID because it's like well nobody's going to pay their bills. Um and like we're kind of on the hook for that and then nobody's going to buy stuff and like that's going to be catastrophic. Um but that was like a real problem with the business model when everybody loses their job as opposed to like if people are trading and the way that collateral is handled is just kind of dumb like that's that could be solved. So that that was kind of like my analysis. I mean you probably had a much closer to the metal analysis. It's like oh wow this is a bad day. Yeah. Um but it was like there's actually like and Mickey Mika is a very close friend of mine. I love that guy to death</p>

>> 他正在做这件事，我相信他。我相信 Robinhood。这几乎是显而易见的。我是说，那是一笔很大的投资，投在一个看起来不妙的项目上。但事后看来，它显然成功了，但当时似乎公司没有系统性问题，而那才是你作为投资者会更紧张的地方。但我很想听听你的看法，因为你显然是在内部。

Um, but it in hindsight it obviously worked out, but it seemed like there wasn't really a systemic issue with the company and that that's where you get a little bit more nervous as an investor. But I would love your take because you were obviously in the in the inside.</p>

我的意思是，在当时，在那一天结束时，很明显我们正在避免流动性和偿付能力风险，这可能是你最大的担忧。通过我们的行动以及市场，我认为我们能够避免这种情况。与此同时，我们在应用商店中排名第一，不仅是金融类第一，而是总榜第一，领先于 Instagram 和 TikTok。

### 重建信任：从品牌危机中漫长恢复
当我们的紧急问题尘埃落定后，我可能花了接下来的两到三年时间……而且情况非常清楚。人们常说，信任一天之内就能失去，但需要很长时间才能赢回。你可以非常缓慢地赢回它。我认为我们经历了这一点，即使是现在，当我在推特上发文时，你仍然会看到有人说，“哦，但我们永远会记得 1 月 28 日。”他们中的大多数人并不了解清算机制和结算的细节。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> when the dust settled on our acute issue, I probably spent the next two to three years um and it was very very clear. You know, they always say that trust can be lost in a day and and and takes a long time to to earn. You can earn it rather slowly. I think we experience that even now when we post when I tweet, you'll have the people saying, "Oh, but you know, we'll always remember January 28th." And most of them don't get into the details of clearing mechanics and settlement.</p>
</details>

他们中的大多数人可能甚至没有直接受到影响。他们没有交易 GameStop 或 AMC，但他们只是从某人那里听说了某件事，而那个人又从另一个人那里听说 Robinhood 与对冲基金勾结，与小散户作对。所以这是最难应对的部分。我认为当时有很多肾上腺素，我们必须在 1 月 28 日解决眼前的问题，我们挺过来了。之后，就是两年的时间，慢慢地从这个品牌深坑中爬出来。我想我们现在基本上已经走出来了。就在几个月前，我们能够说，如果你看我们的 **NPS**（Net Promoter Score: 净推荐值，一种衡量客户忠诚度的指标），我们已经超过了 GameStop 事件之前的水平。所以那是一个重大的时刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Most of them were probably not even affected directly. Like they weren't trading GameStop or AMC, but they just heard something from someone who heard something from someone that Robin Hood's like in cahoots with hedge funds and going going against the little guy. And so that that's been the hard part to to navigate. And I think that, you know, there was a lot of adrenaline. We had to solve the immediate issues on January 28th, which we got past. And then after that, there was just a two-year period of slowly clawing our way out of this uh brand hole um that I think we're, you know, now mostly out of. I think we just a couple of months ago, we're able to say that if if you look at our NPS, um we were sort of like ahead of where we were pre GameStop. So, that was a momentous occasion.</p>
</details>

<details>

<p class="english-text">Besides time, what do you think are the actions that contributed most to the to to the brand getting back to where you wanted to be?</p>

是的，我的意思是，很少有向上的突增。GameStop 就像一个向下的尖峰，对吧？我认为时间是迄今为止最重要的因素。人们会忘记，有新的年轻人、新用户进来，取代了那些非常不满的人。然后就是看看人们抱怨什么，哪些是你可以解决的，然后去解决它们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I mean really there's very few spikes upward. GameStop was like a downward spike, right? Um I think time is by far the biggest element. People forget, you know, you have new young people, new users coming in, replacing the ones that really upset. Uh, and then it's just looking at what things people complain about that you can resolve and addressing those.</p>

然后我认为几年前，我们开始举办这些产品活动，我认为这不仅有实际价值，而且也培养了一个股东和客户的社区。在我们举办活动期间，我们注意到实际上有相当大的增长。如果我们确实获得了几个百分点的微小增长，那通常是在这些活动前后。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Oh, yeah. like they all they eventually got there and it wasn't because but it's just it's hard to explain to somebody who's not a lay person because it's like well wait a minute I sell you stock right I get cash you get stock well it's done well and it's like no no no there's this like deposit trust clearing corporation it's like what are you talking about you crazy conspiracy theorists no no this is how it works and it just it's so complicated to explain because there's all it's like the duck that paddles furiously behind you know underneath the surface like I have the cash you have the stock what are you talking about and It's like, "No, no, no.

是的。我认为你完全正确。我的意思是，加密世界里也发生了一些奇怪的事情，对吧？实际上，如果你看看偿付能力和流动性问题，你有 Celsius 和 BlockFi 以及那整个流动性紧缩，几个月后最终导致 FTX 的崩溃。几周前，你还看到了强制平仓。我的意思是，即使几天前比特币跌破 10 万美元时，也引发了一连串的强制平仓。这有点小众，对吧？

是的，通过通证化，如果做得对，你肯定可以防止那个特定的问题。你还可以获得节假日和周末的 24/7 交易，这非常酷。还有一件事，谈论它可能不符合我的利益，但在某些方面是的。如果你对你的股票进行**自我托管**（Self-custody: 指用户自己保管私钥，完全控制自己的加密资产），你就不会受到券商宕机的影响。你可以轻松地更换券商，你不需要……只有区块链本身宕机，你才会失去交易能力，我认为这非常强大。

<p class="english-text">>> uh yeah with tokenization I think certainly if done right you can prevent that specific issue. You also get 247 trading through holidays and weekends which is very cool. There's also uh something that I probably it's not in my interest to talk about, but in some ways it is. If you self-custody your stocks, you're immune to outages from the broker. You can just sort of like easily replace one brokerage for the other and you don't have to the blockchain would have to be down for you to lose the ability to trade, which I think is very powerful.</p>

更不用说你可能熟悉的事情了，**证券借贷**（Securities lending: 将证券借给其他投资者或公司的行为，通常用于卖空）领域，这是券商和交易对手的一个巨大收入来源，它非常不透明且效率低下。很多这些交易仍然通过彭博终端进行，点对点。

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and they'll want it because our customers want or like um why would it</p>
</details>

我给你举个我认为非常贴切的类比。在 2021 年，我们推出了一个名为 IPO Access 的产品，想法很简单。IPO 从一开始就被机构投资者主导，我们要做的是让散户也能参与 IPO，不仅是私人财富客户，而是真正的大众市场散户。我们当时有一个很大的筹码，就是我们自己要上市。所以我们至少可以保证他们能参与我们的 IPO。当时我们拥有我认为在我们这个规模的 IPO 中肯定是最大的散户配额，大约在 20% 到 25% 之间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I'll give you um I'll give you an analogy that I think is actually pretty close. Um so in 2021 we launched this product IPO access and and the idea is pretty simple. IPOs have been dominated by institutional investors since the dawn of time and we're going to to just make it so that retail can participate in IPOs and and not just private wealth but actual mass market retail and we had this big chip which was we were going public. So we we at the very least could guarantee that they'll get access to ours and and so we at the time had the largest retail allocation I think certainly of any IPO of our size. um it was between 20 and 25%</p>
</details>

然后，当然，我们为自己建立了所有这些伟大的技术。让我们让其他所有人都来做这件事。所以我们让很多其他公司参与了散户 IPO。他们中的大多数，我们都得求人情或者稍微强硬一点，或者利用我们的银行家，因为他们不理解。他们觉得，“这是件奇怪的事。我只是想让我的公司上市，这样我就可以专注于经营我的业务了。每个人都告诉我这是个坏主意。”我们当时并没有真正参与到为散户争取配额的讨论中，银行家们倒是参与了。所以这花了很多功夫，我们得到的配额也很小。就像，“好吧，我们让这些家伙高兴一下。给他们一两个百分点吧。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then of course we had built all this great technology for ourselves. Let's get everyone else to do it. So we got a bunch of other firms to participate in retail IPO. Most of them we kind of had to ask for favors or strongarm a little bit or use our bankers cuz they didn't get it. They were like this is a strange thing. I'm just trying to get my company public so I could focus on running my business. Everyone's telling me this is a bad idea. We weren't really in the room to advocate for retail allocation much like the bankers were. Uh so it took a lot of work and the allocations we got were also quite small. It was like okay well we'll we'll make these guys happy. Let's give them one or two%.</p>
</details>

然后在 2021 年底，市场关闭了。没有人再上市了。然后在 IPO 市场重新开放之间的这段时间里，发生了一件有趣的事情。人们开始清楚地看到，拥有散户追随者的股票实际上会得到更高的估值倍数。你有 Palantir，还有其他一些公司。有人也把我们归入这一类，作为拥有大量散户追随者的股票。所以人们开始打电话给我，询问他们的散户策略。现在你看看过去几个月，几乎所有有影响力的 IPO 都在 Robinhood 上，而且配额越来越大。我们有 Bullish，他们把 20% 的 IPO 配额给了散户。我想 Gemini 也非常相似，我们很幸运地得到了其中的一大部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And then the market shut down at the end of 2021. Nobody was going public anymore. And then something interesting happened uh in the middle between the reopening of the IPO market. Um it started becoming clear that stocks that had retail followings were actually being rewarded with higher multiples. I mean you had Palunteer, you had some others. Um somewhat put us in that category as well as a big retail following uh stock. And so people started calling me to ask about their retail strategy. And now you look in the in the past couple of months, pretty much every IPO of consequence is is on Robin Hood. And with increasing allocations, you know, we had Bullish that gave 20% of their IPO to retail. I think Gemini was very similar and we were fortunate to get a big chunk of that.</p>
</details>

所以，这件事从一件奇怪的事情，一件我们必须很烦人才能让人们参与的事情，变成了现在每个人都理解并想要，甚至有兴趣在 IPO 后做更多的事情。所以，当你问到私募市场准入时，它有非常相似的属性。如果你和这些私营公司的 CEO 交谈，他们通常都认同这个意图和使命。每个人都说，“是的，我很乐意让普通人成为股东，而不仅仅是这些三层结构的**特殊目的实体**（SPV: Special Purpose Vehicle）。”至少比三层 SPV 要好。所以他们基本上同意。他们会说，“哦，是的。权力归于人民。”至少没有多少人会板着脸告诉我，“不，我只想持有股权，然后把它给大机构。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it went from this being from this being this weird thing um that was a little bit I mean we had to be annoying to get people to participate to now everyone kind of gets it and wants it and is like interested in even doing more post IPO. So, I think when you when you ask uh private markets access is is has very similar properties. If you talk to these C CEOs of private companies, they generally are aligned with the the intent and the mission. Everyone's like, "Yeah, I would love normal people to be shareholders and not just these like three layer SPVS. It's at least better than the three layer SPV." So, they kind of agree with it. They're like, "Oh, yeah. Power to the people, you know." um at least not very many people with a straight face have told me no I just want to hold the equity and give it to just the big institutions right you know um and and I think it's genuine most people don't actually love that</p>
</details>

所以是实际操作上的问题阻碍了他们，比如“这是件新事物，我不想在向散户提供私募市场准入方面成为创新者，那不是我业务的重点。我不想当小白鼠。”这让我非常有信心，它会以同样的方式发展。他们会开始慢慢看到它的好处，它会变得常态化，然后优势会变得清晰，比如你会拥有作为私营公司的散户粉丝，他们中的许多人可能是你的客户，或者至少是你的拥护者。然后一切都会变得更加清晰。

<p class="english-text">>> and and so it's the practicalities that get in the way like this is a new thing I don't want to be an innovator in giving private access to uh retail that's not the point of my business. I don't want to be a guinea pig. Which makes me very confident it's going to evolve in the same way too where they'll start to see it a little bit. It'll become normalized and then the advantages will become clear like you'll have retail fans as a private company many of whom could be your customers or at least your advocates. um and then it'll become much more clear and and I actually think for</p>

### AI 时代的挑战：让大众成为所有者
我认为对于 AI 公司来说，这是最关键的。因为如果你把 AI 看作一个类别，你会发现 ChatGPT 和所有这些产品，比如 Cursor 等等，拥有历史上最快的产品普及速度，最快的收入增长。但与此同时，它们也是最受憎恨的类别。你去采访人们，他们对 AI 的看法比对社交媒体还差，因为没人担心社交媒体会抢走他们的工作，对吧？但人们内心深处有一种恐惧，认为这些公司正在自动化一切，“我的工作在那个列表的什么位置？是容易被自动化还是难？”人们对此感到恐慌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">AI companies it's the most critical because if you look at AI as a category you have the fastest product adoption of any products in history with chat GPT and and all these you know cursor and all that fastest revenue ramps and at the same time uh they're kind of the it's the most hated category you interview people and their perception of AI is worse than social media media because they're wor no nobody's worried social media is going to take their jobs right but there's this underlying fear that you know these guys these companies are automating everything and you know where is my job in that list is it easy to automate is it hard um people are freaked out about that</p>
</details>

我认为如果我们不找到一种在所有权方面更平等的方式，我们最终可能会陷入一个非常糟糕的境地。它不应该只被一小部分风险投资家所拥有。事实上，我们应该确保有办法将其分配出去。因为正如我们在公开市场上看到的那些散户股票一样，不与某物对抗的最好方式，就是成为它的所有者。如果你拥有它，你会捍卫它。现在没有多少公众在捍卫 AI 公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and and I think we could end up in a very bad place if we don't figure out how to be a little bit more egalitarian in the ownership like it shouldn't just be owned by a small fraction of of VCs in fact, we should make sure that there's ways to distribute it because the best way to not fight against something as as we've seen in public markets with uh these retail stocks, if you're an owner of it, you'll defend it.

And I think it's a little bit of a back to the future thing, which is I think when Amazon went public, they had like a $600 million market cap, like 25 years ago or 30 years ago, like the normal like there was no such thing as a series D,</p>

And this is a big one, right? which is like to your point it's like oh you got to have like Tro and Fidelity like buy into your IPO and that's that's what's going to give you like a great multiple and actually no no no that's completely false like the fact that Palunteer is like a runaway tech favorite or sorry retail favorite uh and trades at a very high multiple and like it's not just about like trading at a high multiple like that's beneficial if you're a CEO of a company you want to hire and reward talent.</p>

<p class="english-text">>> It was a little earlier, right? 1981.</p>

>> 哦，是的。大概是在 80 年代，但你只要谷歌一下“危险 马萨诸塞州 华尔街日报 苹果 IPO”就能找到。所以其他 49 个州都没问题，没有那种“保姆式国家”的干预，但马萨诸塞州不行，太危险了。而苹果的市值大概上涨了 10%。顺便说一句，他们同时还拥有规模最大、最健全的州立彩票之一。

<p class="english-text">>> Oh yeah. It was like in the 80s, but you can just Google like dangerous Massachusetts, Wall Street Journal, Apple IPO. So 49 other like states, you're okay.

By the way, they have like one of the largest and most robust state lotteries at the same time,</p>
</details>

>> 这简直太疯狂了。但令人难过的是，过去公司会更早上市。**萨班斯-奥克斯利法案**（Sarbanes-Oxley Act: 旨在加强公司治理和财务披露以保护投资者的美国联邦法律）让这变得更难了。所以在安然事件之后，就变成了“好吧，我们必须有更多的控制措施。”成为一家上市公司成本很高。所以你不想在达到一定规模之前上市。因此，没有人会在收入达到……可能现在的传统智慧是至少三四亿美元之前上市，然后才可能值得。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> which is which is so bonkers. But uh and it's just sad that you used to be able to like companies would go public so much earlier and DoddFrank actually not DoddFrank Sarbain Oxley made this a little bit harder. So like coming out of Enron, it's like okay, we have to have more controls. It's expensive to be a public company. So you don't want to go public until you get to a certain level and therefore nobody goes public until probably conventional wisdom right now is like three $400 million minimum revenue and then it might be worth it.</p>
</details>

>> 实际上，对于最好的公司来说，这有点像逆向选择，因为在三四亿美元收入时上市的公司，实际上可能比那些收入达到十亿美元的公司要差。那些增长迅猛的公司，有动力保持私有更长时间。

</details>

>> 为什么要承受这种波动性呢？我最喜欢的一种描述**私募股权**（Private Equity: 投资于非上市公司的股权）公司做什么的方式是——我不会说风险投资，我会说私募股权公司——他们“洗白”波动性。

</details>

>> 因为每天，一项资产的价格是多少？就是任何人愿意支付的价格。但如果你是私募股权公司的投资者，你会觉得，“哇，那天发生了崩盘。我在这只私募股权基金里的价值一点都没跌。”但这并不完全是真的。让这些东西具有流动性，而不是波动性，实际上是有好处的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> because every day what is the price of an asset? It's like whatever anybody will pay for it. But if you're an investor in a private equity firm, it's like wow, like this crash happened on this day. Like my value in this private equity fund didn't fall at all. It's like that's not really true. And there's actually a benefit to having these things be liquid and not the volatility.</p>
</details>

是的。但这很吸引人，实际上这也是公司喜欢保持私有的原因之一，他们不喜欢实时价格的想法，如果股票被通证化，这就是一个因素。但我们正在努力通过在欧盟的通证化以及在美国通过 Robinhood Ventures 来解决这个问题，这是一个我们准备上市的封闭式基金。那里的想法是，是的，利用我们拥有的任何必要手段，我们能否通过我们的零售渠道获得这些资产的敞口。

<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. But yeah, that's it's compelling and that's actually one of the reasons why companies like to stay private and don't like the idea of a realtime price, you know, which is an element if if a stock is tokenized. But um we're working to solve this problem through tokenization in in the EU and also through Robin Hood Ventures in the US which is a closed end fund that um we're going to be taking public and the idea there is yeah using whatever means we have necessary can we get through our retail channels exposure to these assets um and and I think I'm I'm personally uh very involved in this and like driving it forward.

### 资产通胀时代的“所有权经济”
>> 是的。让每个人都成为所有者。有一个有趣的网站叫“1971 年到底发生了什么”。那大概是你脱离金本位制以及其他一些事情的时候。但工资基本停滞，而资产价格却大幅上涨。所以你会说，人们都同意 2022 年有通货膨胀。这就是为什么我们有……美联储不断加息，但那是像牛奶和鸡蛋这类你每天购买的东西的通货膨胀。但与此同时，几十年来，资产价格一直在大幅膨胀，如果你站在拥有资产的那一边，那很棒。但如果你只拿现金……我写了一篇关于这个的小博客，你认为过去 25 年湾区的房价是变贵了还是变便宜了？你猜是什么？过去 25 年，从 2000 年开始。

<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Have everybody be an owner. I mean this is one of there's a there's a funny website called uh WTF happened in 1971. This is kind of when you decoupled from the gold standard amongst other things. But wages were kind of stagnant but asset prices went up a lot. So you would say I mean people agreed that there was inflation in 2022. That's why we had all the, you know, the Fed kept raising interest rates, but that was like inflation for like milk and eggs, like things that you buy every day. But meanwhile, for like dozens of years, the price of assets have been inflating massively, which is great if you're on the side of that that per like if you own an asset, that's great. But if you just get paid cash, I I did a I wrote a little um blog on this where do you think home prices in the Bay Area have gotten more expensive or cheaper in the last 25 years?

### Robinhood 的战略：深度与广度的平衡
>> 同意。Alex，我们想问一下公司战略。我知道你有一个关于做深还是做广的问题。也许我们可以让你来提问。我想到的是，当你们创建这个公司时，也许这可以追溯到某种程度的起源故事，但 Robinhood 现在对很多人来说实际上就像一个银行账户，对吧？这并不是最初的故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Agreed. Alex, we wanted to ask about company strategy. Uh I know you had a question you ask about going deep versus going broad. Maybe we'll tee you up for it. I kind of think of when you were building this and maybe this goes back to the origin story of sorts, but uh Robin Hood is is effectively like a bank account for a lot of people now, right? Which is not the origin story.</p>

<p class="english-text">>> Who hooks you up with the gold one?</p>
</details>

>> 我得去弄张金卡。这在我的待办事项清单上。但你们从一个相当窄的领域开始，然后与客户建立了更深的金融关系。我就是这么想的。我现在可以直接把我的薪水存入我的 Robinhood 账户。我可以把它当作一个银行账户来用，但它好得多，也便宜得多。但也有不同类型的交易者。你们可以在交易领域提供的产品类型上做得非常非常广。我想知道你们是如何在深度和广度之间导航的？是深入挖掘你现在拥有的所有客户，还是同心圆式地扩展到不同类型的客户？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I got to get the gold one. It's on my to-do list. Um, but you can you you started off with this kind of narrow thing and then you've built a deeper financial relationship with customers. That's kind of how I thought about it, which is I can now direct deposit my paycheck into my Robin Hood account. I can I can I can use it as effectively a bank account, but it's much much better. It's cheaper. Um, but also there are different types of traders. Like you could go very very broad in terms of the types of products that you offer in the trading landscape. And I guess how have you navigated depth versus breath? Like go deep with the customer, all the customers that you currently have right now or concentrically expand to different types of customers?</p>
</details>

是的，这是个很好的问题，答案是我们正试图两者兼顾。我们可能是唯一一家寻求广度，但在追求广度的同时，也在每一个领域寻求深度的公司。比如股票交易，我们做得非常深入。我们是第一个引入 24/5 交易的。我们实现了自我清算，所以我们实际上建立了自己的清算技术栈，并且我们在基础设施上进行创新。期权交易也是如此，加密货币也是如此。我们不只是像许多新银行或那些只把加密货币作为一种资产的公司那样做现货加密货币交易。我们在欧盟做永续期货，在美国有加密货币期货，我们有质押，有通证化，对吧？所以我们也在寻求深度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Um, yeah, it's it's a great question and the answer is we're trying to do both. We're probably the only company that is looking to go broad, but as we're going broad, we're looking to deepen in in each of those things. So you know equities trading we're very deep in we we do 24 we were the first to introduce 245 trading uh we went selfcleing so we literally built our own clearing stack and we we actually innovate on the infrastructure there same with options trading same with crypto you know it's not just spot crypto trading like many of the neo banks or folks that are just adding crypto as a asset we're doing perpetual futures in uh the EU, we've got crypto futures in the US, we've got staking, um tokenization, right? So, so we're looking to to go deep as well.</p>
</details>

我认为它之所以能行，是因为我们不能同时在所有地方都做深，但我们必须选择那些对我们来说最具增值效应和杠杆作用的领域，那就是活跃交易者。活跃交易者就像业务的引擎室。在这里，新产品功能能最快地转化为收入。如果你将活跃交易产品改进了 0.5%，你会立即在底线上看到效果，然后我们可以用它作为引擎来进行进一步的投资。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think the reason it works is we can't go deep everywhere simultaneously, but we have to kind of pick the areas where it's most accreative and and highest leverage for us, which is active traders. Active traders like the engine room of the business. It's where new product features translate to revenue most quickly and you know if you improve the active trading product by half of a percent you immediately see that in the bottom line and then we can use that as a engine to make further investments.</p>
</details>

所以是的，对于活跃交易者，我们正在做深。但如果我们着眼于将你所有资产都引入平台的最终目标，我们运行着一个算法，那就是我们如何让存款变得尽可能容易，并消除你所有可能取款的理由。然后我们可以看看人们为什么取款，钱去了哪里，把钱转入 Robinhood 到底有多容易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So yeah active trader is very much we're going deep. Um but then you know we if we look at the end goal of getting all of your assets into the platform there's a kind of an algorithm that we run which is how do we make it as easy as possible to deposit and remove all reasons you you would have from withdrawing your money then we can kind of look at why are people withdrawing money where is it going how easy is it to actually bring that in Robin Hood</p>
</details>

我们这个行业的伟大之处在于，有太多事情可以做，以至于即使你看到我们有很棒的产品迭代速度，我们正在推出新东西，你有时还是会惊讶于我们连一些基本的东西都没有。比如直到几年前，你还不能进行 AAD 转账。我们在 2022 年才加上这个功能。我们只有一种账户类型，个人经纪账户。直到几年前我们加上了 IRA。我们仍然没有信托账户和托管账户。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> um and you know the the great thing about our industry is there's so much to do that even though you see this great product velocity and we're shipping new stuff, you'll some you'll sometimes be surprised at the basic things that we don't have. Like up until a couple years ago, you couldn't actually do an AAD transfer in. We added that in 2022. We had one account type, individual brokerage account. Up until a couple years ago when we added IAS, we still don't have trust accounts and custodial accounts.</p>
</details>

所以，当我和高净值人士交谈时，顺便说一句，这是件新鲜事。过去，当我和我们最好的客户通电话时，他们可能是账户里有几十万或一百万美元的人。后来变成了和有数千万美元的客户交谈。而现在，我经常和那些希望转移数亿美元并存入 Robinhood 的客户交谈。所以，对于一个高净值人士来说，我们还有很多事情要做。但目标是，如果你有一个家族办公室，你应该能够在 Robinhood 上运营它，或者我们可以为你自动化运营，你可以在上面放数百亿美元，并且感觉使用任何其他实体或其他基于券商的解决方案都是一种劣势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, you know, when I talk to high netw worth individuals, and this is, by the way, a new thing. It used to be that when I'm on the phone with our best customers, it was someone that had maybe a couple hundredk or maybe a million in their accounts. Then it went to talking to customers that have tens of millions. And nowadays, I'm routinely talking to customers that are looking to move hundreds of millions and and have that in Robin Hood. And so, you know, for a high net worth individual, there's just tons of things that that we have to do. But the goal is if you have a family office, you should be able to to run that family office on Robin Hood or we can automate the running of that for you and you can have tens of billions on there and feel like you're actually at a disadvantage using any other brickandmortar or or other brokeragebased solution.</p>

>> 有时存在巨大的不确定性。比如，谁能两年前猜到预测市场会成为我们增长最快的业务？所以，很多时候这只是我和总经理以及领导团队之间的对话，我们讨论是否要优先考虑某件事。这就像，我们有合适的人来做这件事吗？我们有多大的信心？你知道，有那些我们知道我们缺失的简单东西，产品差距，但你不能只填补产品差距。你还必须有只有在 Robinhood 上才能找到的东西。因为如果我们只是填补产品差距，我们可能永远也赶不上，然后我们总是会落后。但我喜欢确保在我们的部分产品组合中，我们做一些你在别处找不到的事情。因为你可以指着那些东西，比如 24 小时市场，比如预测市场，比如通证化，你知道那是一个尝试 Robinhood 的强大动力，如果你在别处得不到我们的产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> and sometimes there's great uncertainty. Like who would have guessed two years ago that prediction markets would be our fastest growing business. So you know it's a lot of this is just conversations with me and the GMs and the leadership team where we're we make discussion we we make decisions about whether we prioritize something over something else and it's like do we have the right person to take on this thing? How much conviction do we have? Um, and you know, uh, there there's the there's the easy stuff that we know we're missing, the product gaps, but you can't just build product gaps. You also have to have things that are available uniquely on Robin Hood cuz if we're just building to product gaps, we'll in some we'll we'll probably never catch up fully and then we'll always be we'll always be behind. But I like to make sure across some of the product portfolio, we're just doing things you can't find elsewhere because you can point to those things like 24-hour market, like prediction markets, like tokenization, and you know that that's a strong incentive to try Robin Hood if you can't get our offering anywhere else.</p>

### 赢得所有世代：从婴儿潮到 Z 世代

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

>> 对吧。但最终他们不会一直拥有所有的钱。然后你有千禧一代，他们会用最好的产品。我这么说不只是因为我是 Robinhood 的骄傲所有者。这就像……你试试用 Schwab。我在一家公司的董事会，我的股票是在 Morgan Stanley E*TRADE 里。他们收购了 E*TRADE，但 Morgan Stanley 的网站和 E*TRADE 的不互通。这简直滑稽得可笑。所以年轻一代会用这些好的东西。他们会选择更好的产品，而你们有更好的产品。但现在的问题是，你们得把资产争取过来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Right. But eventually they won't have all the money. Um, and you have this millennial generation that they're going to use the best product. And I'm not just saying this because I'm a proud owner of Robin. Like it's like you're it's just so like try using Schwab. Like I'm on the board of a company where I get my stock grant in Morgan Stanley Erade. It's like they they bought Erade, but the Morgan Stanley site doesn't interoperate with the Erade. It's just it's so comically bad. So the younger generation are going to use these things that are good. They're going to pick the better product and you have the better product. But now it's like you got to get the assets.</p>
</details>

是的。顺便说一句，我经常谈论“巨大财富转移”，有 120 万亿美元将从婴儿潮一代和沉默一代手中转移到年轻一代手中，我认为我们可以成为其中的主要受益者。但那不是我们唯一的策略。我也认为我们可以在婴儿潮一代还活着的时候争取到他们，我们正在为此非常努力地工作，而且我认为我们实际上相当成功。

And by the way, uh I talk a lot about the great wealth transfer 120 trillion moving into the hands of younger generations from the baby boomers and silent uh which I think we can be the the prime beneficiary of.

>> 你看看那些七八十岁使用 Robinhood 的客户，他们超级开心。对他们来说，这就像魔法一样。他们习惯了糟糕的实体银行体验。而你的 Z 世代或 Alpha 世代客户，他们习惯了 Instagram 和 TikTok，他们会说，“为什么这个应用这么卡顿？它应该瞬间加载，我应该……”在某种程度上，他们的期望要高得多，这使得我们必须努力工作来服务他们。但如果我们能让一个 70 多岁的人克服障碍开始使用 Robinhood，那对我们来说就是一个很棒的客户。我们有更多的工具。一是我们正在大力投入家庭金融。如果你使用我们的银行应用，家庭是一个一级标签，这使得管理你的伴侣、你的孩子，所有财务都在一个地方变得非常容易。然后是我们正在进行的这些匹配活动，因为我们有更好的经济模型，我们可以和用户分享更多，这对账户里有很多钱的人非常有吸引力。你想象一下，我们给你 3% 的匹配，而你是一个离退休还有 5 年的人，你的 IRA 里有 1000 万美元。那就是 30 万美元。你可以马上买一辆不错的新款克尔维特，我们立刻就给你。所以这对我们客户的父母，甚至在某些情况下是他们的祖父母，都是一个非常强大的价值主张。

>> 没错。有一小部分人会提出这样的论点。我认为这是一个懒惰的论点，一个反资本主义的论点，但我很好奇最好的反驳是什么。他们基本上会说，像预测市场、加密货币、交易这样的东西，尤其是在年轻人中，他们会称之为“金融虚无主义”之类的。这是一小部分人。最好的反驳是什么？这不是虚无主义，那它是什么？

<p class="english-text">>> Exactly. You know some pe a small subset of people um will will say this argument. I think it's a lazy argument. I think it's an anti- capitalist argument but I'm curious for the best comeback to it. They'll basically say things like prediction markets, things like crypto, things like trading. Especially among younger set, they'll call it something like a financial nihilism or something. It's small subs. What what is sort of the best comeback to it's not nihilism, but what is it?</p>
</details>

你能提醒我一下金融虚无主义的定义吗？我记得我前段时间研究过这个。我想他们是在说，年轻人因为在别处没有选择，所以进入了预测市场或加密货币，这是一种“赚钱赚钱”的心态，但他们指责这一系列活动是某种形式虚无主义的证据。

<p class="english-text">>> Could you remind me what financial nihilism is defined as? I remember I looked into this a while ago. I think they they're sort of making this argument that young people because they don't have options elsewhere are getting into sort of you know either prediction markets or crypto and is this kind of like make money make money but I don't know they're sort of accusing this pool of activities as like evidence of some nihilism in some form.</p>

是的。我想我首先会说，所有东西都在增长，我们的退休金业务也看到了创纪录的增长。很多人把这看作是两种不同的用户。你有你的活跃交易者或虚无主义者或堕落者，然后是那些做着体面事情的人。但实际上，参与度最高的用户会使用我们更多的产品，拥有更多的账户。所以一个人使用 Robinhood 的路径通常是，他们因为想买一只股票或一种加密货币而进来，然后他们中的一些人更活跃，另一些人则不是，但矛盾的是，活跃的人是那些会采纳退休产品、采纳策略类产品的人。他们和我们一起成长的方式不一定是更多的交易，而是扩展到更多的账户，把更多的资产放到平台上。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. I mean the the first thing I would say is uh everything is growing like we're seeing record growth and retirement too. I I think a lot of people sort of like look at this as two different users. Like you have your active traders or nihilists or degenerates and then the folks that are doing respectable things. But in reality um the most engaged users actually use more of our products and have more accounts. So the path uh the path that someone takes when they use Robin Hood typically they come in because they want to buy one stock or one crypto and then some of them are more active others are not but the active ones are the ones that paradoxically adopt retirement adopt products like strategies and the way they grow with us is not necessarily more trading but just expanding into more accounts and putting more assets onto the platform. form. Um,</p>

所以我们没有看到这种情况。我认为没有一个巨大的趋势表明，我们经济中作为保证金或高风险投资的资产比例在增长。整个蛋糕在增长。我认为这也带动了投机活动。现在，很多人会说，有很多投机，这是好是坏？我对此的看法是，预测市场可能是一个很好的例子，现在的大争论是，“等等，这不就是赌博吗？”我们一直被问到这个问题。每一种新的可交易金融资产都会被问到。当期货作为一种资产被创造出来时，就有一场大辩论，人们是否只是在这里投机。这是因为投机对每一个金融市场的运作都至关重要。没有投机，你就不可能有一个正常运作的市场。

<p class="english-text">so we we don't see it. I I think there's not a huge trend where, you know, the percentage of our assets as an economy that are margined or in high-risk investments is growing. The whole pie is growing. Um, and I think that takes with it the speculative activity. Now, now a lot of people will will say, well, you know, there's a lot of speculation and is this is this good? Is this bad? So my take on that and prediction market is probably a great example where the big debate now is well wait a minute is this is just gambling that that's what we get asked all the time. It's been asked about every new financial asset that gets traded. There was a big debate when futures uh was created as an asset whether people are just speculating here and it's because speculation is just critical to the functioning of every financial market. You can't have a working market without speculation. Um,</p>

我不是说每个人都应该用他们所有的钱去投机，对吧？我认为大部分钱应该被动管理，或者用于退休，或者投资于风险较低、波动性较低的投资。但我认为你应该有一个篮子。大多数人确实有一个篮子，他们在那里进行投资并行使自由裁量权。我认为对于那个篮子，我们竞争的是谁能提供最多样化的产品，以及我们是否能为你提供那个理想的产品，让你能够交易你精确的观点。

<details>

<p class="english-text">and I'm not uh not to say that everyone should speculate with all of their money, right? Um, I think that probably most of it should be either passively managed or or retirement or in sort of lower risk, lower volatility investments, but I think you should have a bucket. Um, and and most people do have a bucket where, you know, they invest and and they exercise discretion. And I think for that one we compete over who can offer the the highest diversity of products and can we give you that ideal product for you that allows you to sort of like trade your precise point of view.</p>

我认为预测市场就是一个很好的例子。因为如果你有一个观点，比如你认为特朗普会赢得选举，在预测市场出现之前，你可能不得不购买股票和加密货币，对吧？你会说，“好吧，特朗普，我相信特朗普会赢得选举，而特朗普支持加密货币，所以比特币会上涨。”这在某种程度上是可行的，但有点间接。很多人对公司的财报也有同样的看法。他们认为，“好吧，我很确定特斯拉本季度的交付量会大超预期，所以我要买它的股票。”但然后你会遇到奇怪的事情，比如他们交付量大超预期，或者一家公司每股收益和收入都超预期，但股价却下跌了。

<p class="english-text">I think prediction markets are are a great example of that because if you if you had a view that you know Trump was going to win the election before prediction markets you would have had to maybe buy equities in crypto, right? Yeah. you'd say, "Okay, Trump, I I believe Trump's going to win the election and Trump is pro crypto, so Bitcoin is going to go up." And that somewhat worked, but it's a little bit indirect. And a lot of people have the same view on companies with earnings. They think, "Okay, I'm pretty sure Tesla is going to blow out, for example, blow out their deliveries in a given quarter, so I'm going to buy the stock." But then you have weird things like they blow out their deliveries. Maybe a company beats on EPS and revenue and the stock goes down, right?</p>

对我来说，对于一个交易者来说，这是一种低效率。因为我有一个观点，我想交易那个观点。而这些代理工具让它变得有点低效。预测市场解决了这个问题。这就是为什么我认为对于交易者来说，它有潜力成为一个非常大的市场。而对于大众市场消费者来说，它可能是一个更好的新闻和预测来源。我几个月前发表了一个声明，说我认为预测市场是真相机器。是的。我们不断被各种信息和噪音轰炸。任何人都可以成为网红，任何人都可以有播客。你如何筛选这些信息，找出真正会发生什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and to me, for a trader, this is an inefficiency because I have a point of view. I want to trade that. And these proxies make it a little bit less efficient. And prediction markets solve that. Which is why I think for traders, it has the potential to become a really big market. And for mass market consumers, it could be a better source of news and forecasting. Like I I I I came out with a statement a couple months ago about how I think prediction markets are truth machines. Yeah. Like we're constantly being bombarded by all this information and noise. Anyone can be an influencer. Anyone can have a podcast. How do you sift through that and figure out what's actually going to happen?</p>

>> 嗯，预测市场实际上利用了所有这些力量，整合成一个更准确的预测。那不是猜测。那不是民意调查。那是……一个由真正投入了真金白银的人们形成的价格。

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. which you know they're regulated and and I think that's the best argument for doing prediction markets inside a regulated framework because if if we don't um they could go offshore much like a lot of the crypto business and you know if it's offshore um it's much difficult to to contain the negative externalities.</p>
