### 大脑健康的重要性

如果你想在2026年有一个良好的开端，那么每个人都应该听听这一集。今年我学到并一直铭记在心的一件事，是与世界上一些顶尖的专家讨论我们的大脑。大脑可能是我们所有人拥有的最强大的资产。如果你正在收听《**一位首席执行官的日记**》（Diary of a CEO），你可能是在寻求信息、灵感或娱乐，所有这些都是为了实现某种目标。今年我采访了许多杰出的神经科学家，我意识到这一切都始于拥有一个**健康的大脑**。因为我们所有的思想、情感、人际关系、记忆以及对未来的展望都始于大脑。所以，在这个特别的圣诞节目中，我们将重点关注大脑，探讨如何拥有一个最根本健康的大脑，从而过上最有意义的生活。我回顾了所有我们讨论过大脑的节目，并找出了你们分享和重播最多的时刻，以及那些为你们生活带来最大价值的时刻。今天，我将所有这些内容都整合到了这一集中。

I think everybody needs to listen to this episode if they want to start 2026 properly. If there's one thing I've learned that's really stayed with me this year, it's from speaking to some of the world's leading minds about our brain, which might just be the most powerful asset that we all have. You know, if you listen to the Diary of a SEO, you're probably listening because you're trying to get something, whether it's information, inspiration, maybe entertainment, all of which because you're striving towards some kind of goal. And it's dawned on me this year because I've interviewed so many incredible neuroscientists that this all starts with having a healthy brain. Because all of our thoughts, our feelings, our relationships, our memories, our chance of having a future start in the brain. So, in this special Christmas episode, we're going to focus on the brain. How you can have the most fundamentally healthy brain so you can live the most fundamentally meaningful life. I've been through all the episodes where we've talked about the brain and I've looked at the moments that you shared and replayed the most. and the moments that added the most value to your life. And I've put all of them into this episode today.

### 运动对大脑的益处

你还记得第一次看到人类大脑的情景吗？它改变了你对自身大脑的看法吗？对我来说，那改变了我的人生，我当时就想，我要研究它，那是我一生中见过最酷的东西，它改变了我的生活。我们大多数人都不重视我们的大脑，很多人甚至没有意识到它在那里。但有一天，我做了**脑部扫描**（Brain Scan: 对大脑结构和功能进行成像检查），看到自己的大脑，那次扫描真的改变了我的生活。它给了我所需的动力，让我开始更关心自己的决策和行为如何影响大脑。那么，我们如何才能让大脑变得超级健康、饱满、蓬松呢？所有研究表明，最好的运动是任何能让你心率加快的**有氧运动**（Aerobic Activity: 提高心率和呼吸频率的运动）。无论是快走、足球还是其他活动，只要能让你的心率上升，就非常有效。这种有氧运动水平至关重要，因为它能最大限度地释放**生长因子**（Growth Factor: 促进细胞生长和分化的物质），进入你的**海马体**（Hippocampus: 大脑中负责记忆和学习的区域），从而促进新的脑细胞生长。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Do you remember the first time you saw a human brain? I do. Did it change how you think about your own brain? It changed my life because I was like, I want to study that. That is the coolest thing that I've ever seen in my whole life. It was life-changing. I say that because we, you know, at the start of this conversation, we said that most of us don't appreciate our brain. A lot of people don't even realize it's there. But the minute I had a brain scan one day, and that brain scan really changed my life because seeing my own brain for the first time, it was the push that I needed to start caring more about how my decisions and behaviors are impacting it. So, let's talk about how I can make that ball of tofu in my head, super healthy, big, fat, and fluffy. You talked about exercise earlier on, but we didn't really dig dig into exactly what you mean by exercise cuz exercise, I think, is multifaceted in its definition. What kind of exercise should I be doing to make my ball of tofu in my head great? Yeah. Optimal. Mhm. Well, all the research shows that the best kind of exercise that you can do is anything that gives you aerobic activity that is getting your heart rate up. So that that goes for, you know, power walking will get your heart rate up. So soccer, so many different things. Name your activity. So many people want to say, "Oh, my favorite activity, will that work?" And I always just say, "Is it is your heart rate up when you're doing it?" If the answer is yes, then yeah, that that works great. We know that that level of aerobic activity is critical because that's going to release that growth factor maximally to get into your hippocampus. Uh that will grow those new brain cells. how much?

### 运动量与认知改善

我们实验室进行了两项不同的实验。一项针对那些很少运动（过去三周内运动时间少于30分钟）的**低体能人群**（Low-fit People: 身体素质较差的人群）。我们让他们每周进行两到三次有氧运动，并与**动感单车课程**（Spin Class: 一种高强度室内单车运动）合作。结果发现，那些成功每周进行两到三次45分钟有氧运动的人，他们的情绪显著改善，记忆功能提高，并且转移和集中注意力的能力也显著增强。这为低体能人群提供了一个指导：每周两到三次运动就能开始带来认知上的改变。对于那些经常运动的人，我们去了另一个动感单车工作室，提供免费课程，让他们可以每周运动多达七次，对照组则保持不变（每周运动两次）。结果发现，基本上**每一次流汗都算数**。你运动得越多，大脑的变化就越大，包括海马体功能、**前额叶功能**（Prefrontal Function: 大脑前部区域的功能，涉及决策、规划和注意力）以及情绪都有所改善。即使你已经每周运动两次并从中受益，但运动得越多，大脑的变化就越大。所以，我喜欢告诉大家，**每一次流汗都对构建你想要的大脑有益**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So, I have an answer to that. So, we did two different experiments in my lab. One in low-fit people, people that are really not exercising very much at all, less than 30 minutes in the last three weeks you've moved your body. And we asked what could we see any behavioral improvement in your memory function from your hippocampus or your ability to shift and focus attention if we ask you to move your body in an aerobic way for two to three times a week and we collaborated with a spin class. So clearly very aerobic. And what we found was in those people that did successfully do two to three times a week of 45-minute aerobic activity, their mood got significantly better, their memory function got better, and their ability to shift and focus attention got significantly better. So that gives a little bit of a guideline for low-fit people. Two to three times a week can start to give you some of those some of those cognitive changes. But you don't look low-fit. So let me let me answer the question you're about to ask me with like what about me? I exercise pretty regularly and how much how much do I need? So to answer that question, we went to another spin studio and we said look, we're going to give you free classes. You could exercise as much as you want in this in this at this studio and go up to seven times a week. And the control was just stay the same. You know, you they were they were working out twice a week at at the studio and Troll was the other group that what you were testing them against. Yes. Exactly. And so what we found was basically every drop of sweat counted. The more you exercise, the more change in your brain. We noted both your hippocample function, prefrontal function, and mood. if you you were already getting benefit, you know, you're already going twice a week, but the more you did, the more brain changes you got. So that that doesn't give the formula that I would like, but we were heading in that direction, which is part of one of the questions that I want to answer. But I love to leave people with the idea that every drop of sweat counts for building your brain into the big fat fluffy brain that you really want.

### 运动对心态和认知表现的影响

在现实世界中，运动如何改变我们的表现？如果你允许，它会对你的心态产生积极影响。例如，你可以早起30分钟去散步，或者接受邻居的邀请一起遛狗。这不应该是一种义务，而是你为自己做的事情。它将直接有益于你大脑中的“豆腐球”，让它更好地运作。我认为，我每天都能从中受益的最直接的一点是，每次运动时释放的**血清素**（Serotonin: 一种神经递质，影响情绪和幸福感）、**多巴胺**（Dopamine: 一种神经递质，与奖励和动机有关）和**去甲肾上腺素**（Noradrenaline: 一种神经递质和激素，影响警觉性和注意力）带来的情绪提升。我经常做播客，非常依赖大脑和嘴巴的协调，有时会发现它们不同步。有时我也会在舞台上演讲。我曾看到演讲者**托尼·罗宾斯**（Tony Robbins）在登台前在蹦床上跳跃。我常问自己，在大型演讲或演示前，我是否应该在休息室里锻炼一下？答案是肯定的。这在科学和神经科学中的依据是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And then in the real world, again, making it super real for people. Yeah. How how does that change how I show up? Yeah. if you allow it to should have a beautiful effect on your mindset. Um that your mindset around um how often should I take wake up and 30 minutes early and do that walk before I start my day or uh accept the the invitation to go uh walk the dog with with a neighbor. Um it's not an obligation. It is something that you're doing for yourself. It is going to have direct benefits on that ball of tofu, as you call it, in your head. It's going to make it work better. And and I mean, I think the most immediate thing that I benefit from every single day is the mood boost that you get from that serotonin, dopamine, nor adrenaline that gets released every time you move your body. I always think that because obviously I do a lot of podcasting and it's I'm super reliant on my brain being attached to my mouth and sometimes I notice that it's not. You know what I mean? like sometimes I'm notic from from your and also I speak on stage sometimes. So I've often asked myself cuz I saw Tony Robbins the speaker one day on a trampoline before he goes up on stage. I ask myself okay should I be doing a workout in my green room before I go up on stage for a big talk or presentation? You think I should? Oh yeah absolutely. What's the basis of that in science and neuroscience?

</details>

### 运动的即时神经科学效应

运动的即时效应是其科学基础。每次你活动身体，都会产生三个关键效应。首先是**情绪**：你的多巴胺和血清素水平会升高。其次是**专注力和注意力**：虽然一次运动不会在前额叶皮层产生更多突触，但前额叶皮层使用多巴胺，所以即使是单次运动也能让你的前额叶皮层在专注力和注意力方面表现更好，这在演讲时也非常重要。第三是**反应时间**：当你活动身体时，你的**运动皮层**（Motor Cortex: 大脑中控制身体运动的区域）会工作，单次运动后，你的反应时间会显著缩短。因此，在站起来演讲之前进行锻炼是非常有益的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Uh it's the basis is that immediate effect. So there's three key effects that we know happen every time you move your body. First one is mood. You're going to get your dopamine, your serotonin up. Um second is focus and attention. So so a single workout isn't going to make more synapses in your prefrontal cortex, but the prefrontal cortex uses dopamine. And so um it's clear that even a single workout can make your prefrontal cortex work better in terms of focus and attention. Also very important anytime you're speaking. And the third is reaction time. Your reaction time, you know, motor your your your working your motor cortex when you move your body. And your response and reaction time is significantly shorter after a even a single workout compared to if you just don't work out and sit sit um alone. So great great things to do. A great thing to do before you you stand up and speak.

</details>

### 咖啡与大脑健康

关于咖啡，我一直在思考它对大脑是好是坏。我听到了关于其影响的一些不同说法。**咖啡因**（Caffeine: 一种中枢神经系统兴奋剂）是一种兴奋剂，人们对其反应各不相同。咖啡因过度刺激不利于你组织语言。我的书《**健康大脑，快乐生活**》（Healthy Brain Happy Life）中的一个主要主题是**自我实验**（Self-experimentation: 通过个人实践来测试某种方法或物质的效果）。你可以调整咖啡的摄入量，看看哪种水平最适合你的播客或演讲。另一个与咖啡效果类似，我每天早上都在做的事情是**冷热交替淋浴**（Hot-cold Contrast Showers: 轮流使用热水和冷水淋浴）。冷水淋浴后，它会刺激你体内产生**肾上腺素**（Adrenaline: 一种激素和神经递质，能提高警觉性和能量），这是一种天然的肾上腺素，能让你清醒。刚开始尝试时会有些痛苦，但之后你会上瘾。我有时会忘记做，然后又回到淋浴间用冷水冲自己，因为早上这样做让我感觉更好。所以，有很多不同的方法可以探索。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

What about coffee? I I I'm trying to figure out if coffee is good for my brain, bad for my brain. I've had a couple of mixed messages around the impact it might be having. Yeah. You know, caffeine is a stimulant and uh people respond to that kind of stimulant uh in different ways. Over stimulation with caffeine is is not good for your be able your ability to put words together. You know, this is where I turn to a a main theme in in my book healthy brain happy life with this which is self-experimentation for you. How what can you titrate your coffee to see what level of coffee is best for whatever your podcast or you're giving a talk? The other thing that can work similarly to coffee that that I've started uh and that I do every morning is um hot cold contrast showers because that cold that you shower on yourself after the heat um stimulates adrenaline in you. a natural adrenaline. It wakes you up and okay, it was painful the first kind of few times I tried it, but then you get addicted to it and I have forgotten to do it and gotten back in the shower just to douse myself with cold water because I feel better when I do that for for you know first thing in the morning. So, lots of different things that one can explore with.

### 损害大脑的行为：久坐与睡眠不足

那么，反过来说，人们有哪些行为会损害他们的大脑呢？**久坐行为**（Sedentary Behavior: 缺乏身体活动的生活方式）是其中之一。**睡眠不足**（Not Getting Enough Sleep: 缺乏充足的睡眠）也至关重要。我们还没有谈到睡眠，但睡眠对大脑的正常运作非常重要。我喜欢通过吓唬我的学生来强调这一点：在酷刑中，如果一个人长时间被剥夺睡眠，他们真的会死亡。如果连续数小时被剥夺睡眠，你就无法正常运作，它就是如此关键。然而，我们却乐此不疲地熬夜看Netflix，只睡5个小时，而本可以睡8个小时。那么，到底发生了什么？为什么睡眠如此重要？原因有很多，我将说两点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Okay, on the other side of the coin then, what are some of the central behaviors that people do that destroy their brain? Well, sedentary behavior is one of them. Um, not getting enough sleep is critical. We haven't talked about sleep yet. Sleep is so important for normal functioning of the brain. I like to scare my students by saying that um you know in torture situations if you deprive a person of sleep for too long they literally die. They they they die. You cannot function if you are deprived of sleep for too many hours in a row. It's that critical. Yet we don't we we happily, you know, watch too much Netflix at night and and and and get only 5 hours of sleep when we could have had eight. So um what's happening exactly? Why is it so important? Well, there's um there's so many different things. I'm gonna I'm gonna say two.

</details>

### 睡眠对记忆巩固和废物清除的重要性

首先，我们知道在正常的健康睡眠中，**海马体**（Hippocampus: 大脑中负责记忆和学习的区域）会进行活动，帮助你巩固前一天形成的记忆。这被称为**记忆巩固**（Consolidation: 将短期记忆转化为长期记忆的过程），它非常重要。如果你缩短睡眠时间，睡眠不足，你就无法巩固日常记忆。其次，睡眠是我们大脑清除所有**代谢废物**（Metabolites: 生物体内新陈代谢产生的物质）的时间。所有生物细胞都会产生废物，这些“垃圾”通过流经大脑的**脑脊液**（Cerebral Spinal Fluid: 环绕大脑和脊髓的液体）被清除。如果你睡眠不足，大脑中就会堆积这些代谢废物，就像你的大脑变得“黏糊糊”的。当你睡眠不足时，你是否会感觉大脑里有“垃圾”？这正是实际发生的情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

One is that we know that in regular healthy sleep, there is activity in the hippocampus that helps you strengthen the memories that you have formed in that previous day. It's called consolidation and it's so important. If you shorten that, if you don't get enough, you are not consolidating your normal everyday memories. And second, it is uh the time during sleep when all the metabolites, all that garbage that your brain is producing because all biological cells produce garbage, it gets kind of um cleaned up um through the cerebral spinal fluid that that is flowing through your brain. And if you do not get enough sleep, you build up garbage metabolites in your brain. It's like you have a gunky brain. And do you feel like I feel like I have gunk in my brain when I don't sleep enough. That is exactly what is what is happening.

</details>

### 饮食对大脑健康的影响

当我们考虑食物、饮料、酒精等摄入物时，如果我想拥有一个最佳的大脑，我应该吃什么或不吃什么？我认为最有力的证据支持**地中海饮食**（Mediterranean Diet: 一种以蔬菜、水果、全谷物、豆类、坚果和橄榄油为基础的饮食模式）的益处。它基本上是所有健康的、未经加工的、色彩丰富的食物。有大量证据表明它对大脑非常有益，这是我的首选。如果你吃的东西符合地中海饮食，那就吃吧。如果加工过多，就少吃一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Well, when you think about um things that we consume, you know, like food and drink and alcohol and all these kinds of things, is there is there anything that if I'm trying to have an optimal brain, I should be Yeah. having or not having? Yeah. Well, so um I think the most evidence is around the benefit of the Mediterranean diet which is basically all healthy uh um kind of organic not organic but nonprocessed is the word I was trying to think of things to eat that are very very colorful. There is so much evidence about how good that is generally for the brain that that is my go-to. Like what should I eat? Well, is it on the Mediterranean diet? If it is, then go ahead. If it's too processed, only do it just a little bit.

</details>

### 社交连接与大脑健康

如果我们的朋友较少，人际关系不那么牢固，或者感到孤独，我们的大脑会萎缩，更容易患上**痴呆症**（Dementia: 一种进行性认知功能障碍）和**阿尔茨海默病**（Alzheimer's: 一种进行性神经退行性疾病，导致记忆力、思维和行为问题）吗？是的，我们是社会性动物。有非常有力的研究表明，社交连接的数量与寿命之间存在关联，这包括仅仅向**星巴克**（Starbucks）的咖啡师打个招呼。这不一定是你30年发展起来的亲密友谊，而是你与多少人互动和打招呼。你定期互动的人越多，你的整体寿命就越长。如果谈到大脑健康，社交连接也绝对对你非常有益，它还能带来幸福感。我的朋友兼同事**罗伯特·沃林格**（Robert Wallinger）研究了什么能让人快乐。这项研究始于1920年代的**哈佛大学**（Harvard），经过几十年的研究，答案是：**社交连接的强度能带来幸福感**。所以，它让你更快乐，让你活得更久。反之，孤独会引起压力，长期的压力会损害大脑，从长远来看，会使大脑变小，变得不那么健康。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Is it true that if we have less friends, if we have less strong relationships, if we're lonely, then our brain will shrink and is more prone to dementia and Alzheimer's and things like that. Yes, we are social creatures and um there are uh really powerful studies that have shown the correlation between the number of social connections that we have including just saying hello to the barista at Starbucks. It's not a close friendship that you develop over 30 years. It's it's just how many people you interact with and greet and longevity. The more people you are regularly interacting with, the longer you are living overall longevity. But if you go into brain health, absolutely it's also very very healthy for you. It also brings happiness. So uh friend and colleague of mine um Robert Wallinger uh studied um what makes people happy. The study started in the 20s, the 1920s and in Harvard. And after all of those many many many decades, the answer is what brings happiness is the strength of your social connections. So it makes you happier. It makes you live longer and and uh yes, loneliness on the on the um flip side causes stress uh long-term stress that that damages the brain and uh yeah, in the long term can can make it smaller and uh less healthy.

</details>

### 肌酸：大脑的能量助推器

这是第五个被重播最多的时刻。当我问你目前最兴奋的事情时，你的回答中有一项让你眼前一亮，那就是**肌酸**（Creatine: 一种天然存在于肌肉细胞中的化合物，有助于产生能量）。肌酸已经存在了几十年，在我看来，它一直是一种健身人士的补剂，我当时觉得我不需要变得肌肉发达，不需要肌酸。这个想法持续了很多年。但在过去五年左右，肌酸对大脑的影响开始真正引起我的兴趣。任何影响大脑的事物都会让我非常感兴趣，这也是肌酸让我最兴奋的原因。同时，我也开始进行大量的**阻力训练**（Resistance Training: 通过对抗阻力来增强肌肉力量和耐力的运动）。肌酸以**磷酸肌酸**（Phosphocreatine: 肌酸的一种高能形式，在肌肉中储存能量）的形式储存，主要用于产生能量。因此，它结合阻力训练可以增加肌肉质量和力量，因为它能更快地再生和产生能量。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Here's the fifth most replayed moment. When I asked you before this conversation started rolling what you're really excited about at the moment, your response to me was there was a few things, but one of them which lit up your face was creatine. Yes. And it's funny because it lit up your face again. Yeah. It's it's funny because creatine has been around for I mean ever for decades and it's always been in my mind it was like one of those gym bro things. I'm like I don't need to be swole. Yeah. I don't need creatine get get swole. And you know this is this was the thought for for many many years. And then over the last five years or so, the effects of creatine on the brain started to really get my interest. Anything that affects the brain, I really become interested in. And so that's kind of what did get me the most excited about about creatine. But also, I started doing a lot of resistance training. And so I was like, "Okay, here I am now. I'm like one of those gym guys. I'm doing I'm doing the barbells. I'm doing the, you know, the squats and the deadlifts and all that and so, so why not give myself some of the creatine? Well, what is creatine, right? Why is it important? You talked about earlier, you know, why doesn't our body just make more of these things that are so beneficial? We do make creatine. We make about, I don't know, our liver makes about 1 to three grams a day of creatine. And our brain also makes creatine and those are the two organs that make it. Creatine gets consumed by other tissues like the muscle is probably the one that's the greediest because creatine is stored as phosphocreatine but it's used to make energy essentially. So it can increase muscle mass, it can increase muscle strength in combination with resistance training because you're able to regenerate and make energy faster.

</details>

### 肌酸的肌肉与大脑效应

例如，我通过阅读研究发现，补充肌酸并进行阻力训练的人能够获得更多的**瘦体重**（Lean Body Mass: 身体中除脂肪外的所有组织质量）和力量，并增加训练量。你可以多做一到两次重复训练，它似乎还能缩短组间恢复时间。任何能增加训练量的东西都会带来下游效应，比如增加肌肉质量或力量。我大约一年前开始补充肌酸，每天摄入约5克，因为这被证明对肌肉健康结合阻力训练有益。重要的是要认识到，单独补充肌酸而不进行任何阻力训练，并不能增加肌肉或力量。你必须付出努力，因为肌酸的作用是帮助你更快地产生能量。更快地产生能量意味着你能更好地、更努力地进行锻炼，做更多。所以，它有点像给你的锻炼方案“**超级充电**”（Supercharging: 大幅增强性能）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So, for example, I became interested in it after reading studies where people that supplemented with creatine that were engaged in resistance training were able to gain more lean body mass. They were able to gain more strength. It was increasing their training volume. So, you can do one to two more reps, right, of of whatever exercise you're doing. And it seems to decrease the recovery time between those those sets as well. So, you're able to increase your training volume. Well, anything that's going to in increase your training volume is going to then have the downstream effect of, you know, increasing the adaptations like increased muscle mass or increased muscle strength. I started supplementing with creatine about a year ago and I started supplementing with it for that reason, for the my training and I was doing about five grams a day because that was really what was shown to to be beneficial for muscle health in combination with resistance training. And it's important for people to realize that supplementing with creatine by itself, without any type of resistance training, isn't going to grow your muscle. It's not going to make you stronger. You have to put in the effort because what creatine is doing, it's helping you make the energy quicker, right? And that and then being able to make that energy quicker means that you're able to then do that exercise better, um, harder, more of it, right? So, um, it's sort of sup supercharging your exercise routine.

</details>

### 肌酸在大脑压力下的作用

我之前已经知道肌酸对大脑的影响。大脑也消耗大量能量，所以它会自己制造肌酸。但事实证明，如果你能给大脑提供更多的肌酸，尤其是在任何导致压力的时期，比如睡眠不足、情绪或心理压力，或者像我这样认知负荷很高，每天都在学习复杂概念、记忆事物、整合想法并提出新假设，这是一种对大脑的认知压力。在这种压力条件下，肌酸在大脑中会发挥作用。**抑郁症**（Depression: 一种常见且严重的精神疾病，影响情绪、思维和行为）也是一种大脑压力，**神经退行性疾病**（Neurodegenerative Disease: 导致神经细胞功能丧失和死亡的疾病）也是。所以，在任何压力条件下，肌酸在大脑中都会大放异彩。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

I had already been aware of the effects on the brain. I thought maybe the five grams a day would do that. So what are the effects on the brain? Well, your brain also consumes a lot of energy, you know, needs a lot of energy. So it does make its own creatine. But it turns out if you can if you can give your brain more of that creatine particularly under a period of anything that's causing stress. So let's say lack of sleep or let's say emotional psychological stress or in my case high cognitive load where you're just every day learning concepts, complex things. you're trying to remember them. You're putting ideas together and coming up with new hypotheses and you know, you're just you're just you're studying a lot and it's very cognitively demanding and it's it's a type of stress on your brain. That's like my life, right? Um under this condition of stress, depression is another one that's a stress on your brain or neurodeenerative disease, that's a stress on your brain. So any kind of stressful condition, that's where creatine shines in the brain.

</details>

### 肌酸的补充剂量与认知功能

我认为我们所有人，谁能做到完美睡眠，从不感到压力？没有人，对吧？总会有某种压力存在。所以，我需要补充肌酸。许多不同实验室都进行了非常有趣的研究，其中一些来自**德国**（Germany）的研究考察了肌酸的剂量以及它如何增加大脑中的肌酸水平。这就是为什么我现在每天补充10克肌酸。德国的研究发现，如果你每天补充5克肌酸，你的肌肉会贪婪地消耗它，尤其是在你锻炼时。大约每天5克，特别是几个月后，你的肌肉就会饱和。超过这个量，多余的肌酸就会“溢出”到大脑。这项德国研究发现，**每天10克肌酸能增加大脑多个不同区域的肌酸水平**。这可能是最令人兴奋的证据，表明每天补充超过5克肌酸确实能将肌酸输送到大脑。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

I would argue that um all of us who who has the perfect amount of sleep never has stress nobody, right? There's always some sort of stress in the background. So, um that's when I was like, okay, so if you're the perfect person, you have no stress, you get the perfect amount of sleep every night, your brain makes enough creatine to kind of do what it needs to do. I know that I'm constantly under stress. So, um I'm like, okay, well, I think I need a boost. And this is where a lot of very interesting studies have come out of many different labs. Um, some out of Germany that looked at the dose of creatine and how it increases creatine levels in the brain. And this is why I now supplement with 10 grams a day. So the study out of Germany found that five grams a day of creatine, if you're supplementing with five grams a day, your muscles are greedily consuming it. Particularly if you're working out, they want it. They want it. after about five grams a day, especially over a few months, like you're you're saturating your muscle and that's enough, right? Anything above that kind of spills over to the brain. And so they what this German study found was that 10 grams of creatine increased creatine levels in several different regions of the brain. And that was probably the most exciting, you know, I would say evidence that supplementing higher than five grams a day was actually doing something in terms of getting creatine into the brain.

### 肌酸与睡眠剥夺及抑郁症

现在已经有各种研究考察了不同的结果。如果你补充10克甚至更高剂量的肌酸，比如20克，它会如何影响**认知功能**（Cognitive Function: 大脑处理信息、学习、记忆和解决问题的能力）？**加拿大里贾纳大学**（University of Regina in Canada）的**达伦·坎多博士**（Dr. Darren Kandow）进行了一些研究，他们考察了**睡眠剥夺**（Sleep Deprivation: 缺乏充足睡眠的状态）等情况。研究发现，如果你让一个人睡眠剥夺21小时，然后给他们25到30克肌酸，它能完全抵消睡眠剥夺带来的认知缺陷。实际上，它不仅能抵消认知缺陷，还能让人们比休息充分时表现得更好。这让我意识到，在我旅行时差、睡眠不足，但又必须做播客或演讲等情况下，我会把肌酸剂量从10克提高到20克左右。例如今天，我虽然没有睡眠不足，但认知需求很高，这是一个很长的播客。所以我今天把肌酸剂量提高到了20克。即使是10克，我也不会感到下午的疲劳，即使没有进行**生酮饮食**（Ketogenic Diet: 一种低碳水化合物、高脂肪的饮食方式）。这对我来说非常明显，有时我只摄入5克，然后就会感到疲惫。这很有趣，也许是安慰剂效应，但肌酸确实能更快地再生能量，这对大脑也有益。

There have now been a variety of studies that have looked at different outcomes, right? So, if you supplement with 10 grams of creatine or even go higher than that, like 20 grams of creatine, how does that affect cognitive function, right? And so, um some of these studies have been been done by uh Dr. Darren Kandow. He's um at the University of Regina in Canada and it's looked they've looked at things like sleep deprivation and it's been found that if you take someone and you sleep deprive them for 21 hours and give them about 25 to 30 grams of creatine, it completely negates the cognitive deficits of sleep deprivation. Actually, not only does it negate the cognitive deficits of sleep deprivation, it makes people function better than if they were well-rested. That's where I was like, wait a minute, there's many times when I'm traveling, I'm jet-lagged. Uh lots of times when I'm sleepd deprived and I have to be doing a podcast or a presentation, whatever. And in those situations, I go up from my 10 grams to more like 20 grams. Today, for example, I wasn't really sleepdeprived, but you know, there's a lot of high cognitive demand. This is a long podcast. There's all that stuff. And so, I went up to 20 grams today on my creatine. And I well, I will say even at the 10 gram for me, we were talking about this with respect to being in ketosis. I don't feel that mid-after afternoon crash when I have the creatine, not being on a ketogenic diet, not being in ketosis. It's very clear for me and I've done this where sometimes I only do five grams and then if I do that I'll notice I'm like why am I tired right now? So there's something interesting and maybe it's placebo. I'm going to throw that out there. Very possible. But I don't know maybe the creatine is again it's able to regenerate that energy quicker and so that's also beneficial for the brain.

### 肌酸研究的新焦点与特殊人群

现在，许多肌酸研究人员正在将焦点转向大脑。过去，研究主要集中在肌肉上，但现在人们对肌酸对大脑的作用非常感兴趣，特别是当你补充更多剂量时。这对于处于压力状况下的人很重要，也对**素食者**（Vegans: 不食用任何动物产品的人）很重要，因为肌酸主要存在于肉类、家禽、鱼类、奶制品等动物产品中。许多素食者不吃这些食物。我让很多素食朋友开始补充肌酸，这改变了他们的生活，他们觉得这太不可思议了。想象一下，一个饮食中没有肌酸的人，突然开始补充5到10克肌酸，他们会感到精力充沛。有些人甚至说他们需要的睡眠更少，这很有趣，我听很多人说过，他们的大脑似乎不需要那么多睡眠，他们有更多的精力。所以，我一直是肌酸的忠实粉丝，不仅因为它对肌肉有益，更因为它对大脑也有益。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And now I I would say all these creatine researchers a lot of them are shifting to the brain. It used to be all muscle focused and now people are super interested in what creatine is doing to the brain, especially if you're supplementing with more of it. And you know, this is important for people that are under a stressful situation, but also for vegans because creatine is found in food, mostly in animal products like meat and poultry and fish, dairy. A lot of vegans don't eat that. And I've had so many of my vegan friends, I've got them on the creatine, and it's changed their lives. I mean, they're like, "This is like incredible." You know, can you imagine someone who's not getting any creatine from their diet cuz they eat no meat and all of a sudden they start supplementing with 5 10 grams of creatine and it's like they have energy. Some people say they they require less sleep, which is kind of interesting. That's kind of a comment I've heard many many times from people is that it's like their brain doesn't need as much sleep. They have more energy. So, um, I've been a big fan of the creatine, um, not only for the muscle especially because, you know, working out is something that's very important, but for the brain as well.

### 肌酸的“负荷期”与即时效应

我一直认为肌酸需要“**负荷期**”（Loading Phase: 在补充剂开始阶段摄入较高剂量以快速饱和体内储存的过程），然后经过几周或几个月才能见效。但你告诉我，如果我早上服用肌酸，当天就能体验到认知功能的改善，前提是剂量足够大。这是一个很好的问题。你提到的许多研究都是在运动和肌肉表现的背景下进行的。人们需要进行负荷期（例如20克），然后进入5克的维持期，是因为大约需要一个月左右的时间才能使肌肉中的肌酸储备饱和。这意味着肌酸以**磷酸肌酸**（Phosphocreatine: 肌酸的一种高能形式，在肌肉中储存能量）的形式储存在肌肉中，并随时准备用于产生能量。同样，这大约需要一个月的时间，除非你给肌肉高剂量。所以，每天5克肌酸需要很多天才能饱和。当你进行负荷期时，你只是加速了整个过程。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

I always thought of creatine as something that you you took and you kind of had to load up on and then over a couple of weeks or months, the effects would kick in. But you're telling me that if I had creatine in the morning, that same day, I would experience potentially improved cognition if I have a big enough dose. Yes. So, um, great question. A lot of studies that have been done that you're referring to have been done in the context of exercise and muscular performance. And the reason why people have to load up on like they do a loading phase, let's say 20 grams and then they go down to this sort of maintenance phase of 5 g is because it takes I don't know, I think it's about a month or so before you can saturate your muscular stores of creatine. And then what does that mean? It means that um the creatine which is actually stored in your muscle as phosphocreatine is there and ready to be used to make energy. So so it takes again it takes about a month or so to do that unless you are really giving your muscles a high dose, right? So the five grams a day it only it can only do it for so many days and then finally you get saturated. When you do this loading phase you kind of just accelerate that whole process.

### 肌酸对大脑压力的帮助

这就是为什么当人们进行实验测试肌酸效果时，他们希望参与者能快速达到高水平的肌酸，因为他们不想进行长达一个月的实验，他们希望实验持续几周或一周。这就是负荷期背后的概念。如果你不是要参加某种比赛，比如**CrossFit**（CrossFit: 一种高强度综合健身训练），如果你已经每天补充5克肌酸大约一个月，你就不需要负荷期。当肌酸对大脑产生作用时，如果你的摄入量超过5克（大部分已被肌肉消耗），血液中会有些残留，大脑会吸收它。肌酸真正发挥作用是在压力条件下，对我来说，每天都充满认知挑战，因为我不断学习新知识，处理各种事情。所以我的大脑承受着很大的认知压力，我感觉自己一直处于这种压力之下。在这种情况下，肌酸进入大脑有助于你更快地产生能量。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And so that's why when people are doing these experiments where they want to test the effects of creatine, they want they want the participants to have really high levels of creatine in their muscles quick because they don't want to do a month-long experiment, right? They want the experiment to be like a couple of weeks or a week. So that was kind of the whole concept behind this loading phase. If you're not someone who's going to some kind of competition, you know, like your CrossFit games or something, you don't really need to do that loading phase if you've already been supplementing with five grams a day for like a month. When it comes to the brain, what's happening if you get above that 5 g, that's pretty much all consumed by the muscle. You're having some leftover in circulation and the brain takes it up and it takes it up, right? When it re what it really shines is under that stressful condition, which again for me, I feel like every day is this is is like cognitively demanding for me because I'm constantly, you know, learning new material or learning new information or working on things, right? And so there's a lot of cognitive stress on my brain. And so I feel like I'm constantly under that stress. And that's where getting the creatine in your brain helps you make that energy quicker.

### 肌酸与抑郁症及阿尔茨海默病

这就是为什么我曾经历时差、睡眠不足，却必须在早上5点（我的生物钟时间）进行演讲，我服用了25克肌酸。它对我的帮助简直不可思议。当然，这可能是**安慰剂效应**（Placebo Effect: 因预期治疗效果而产生的实际生理或心理改善），这没关系，安慰剂效应是真实存在的，而且很棒。但也有证据表明肌酸确实有效，它有助于缓解睡眠剥夺和压力状况。我读到一项2025年的研究，他们给患有抑郁症状的人服用肌酸，并结合**认知行为疗法**（CBT: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: 一种心理治疗方法，帮助人们识别和改变消极思维模式）。结果发现，同时服用肌酸和接受认知行为疗法的人，其抑郁症状的改善程度远大于只接受认知行为疗法的人，这令人难以置信。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And so that's why like I've done I've had, you know, been jetlagged and have have to give a talk at you, you know, like 5:00 a.m. in the morning, my my biological time after not getting sleep. And I've done like 25 grams of creatine. And it it's insane how much it helps me. Again, it could be placebo because I'm anticipating that effect, which is fine. Placebo is a real thing. It's great. I'm all about it. But there's some evidence also that this works, right? That the creatine is helping with under that sleep deprivation and that stressful condition. I was reading about a study in 2025 where they gave creatine to people that had depressive symptoms alongside CBT training. And the people that had creatine and the cognitive behavioral therapy training experienced a greater improvement in their depression symptoms than those who just received the cognitive behavioral therapy, which is which is incredible.

### 肌酸的抗炎作用与未来研究

这太令人着迷了。抑郁症是一种大脑压力，我们知道**炎症**（Inflammation: 身体对损伤或感染的自然反应）和**氧化应激**（Oxidative Stress: 体内自由基和抗氧化剂失衡导致细胞损伤的状态）在抑郁症中都扮演着角色。现在有一些动物研究表明，肌酸似乎具有**抗炎作用**（Anti-inflammatory Effect: 减轻炎症反应的作用）。这还没有完全弄清楚，所以我不知道这是否完全是其能量成分的作用，也可能是肌酸在抗炎方面扮演着新发现的角色。我对此了解不多，也不知道是否有足够的研究。但我确实知道它存在，而且这很吸引人，因为肌酸在大脑中真正发挥作用的地方，一项又一项研究表明，是在某种压力条件下，比如抑郁症或睡眠剥夺。最近还有一项研究，大约一个月前发表，虽然是一个非常小的初步研究，没有安慰剂对照组，但它确实表明，给**阿尔茨海默病**（Alzheimer's Disease: 一种进行性神经退行性疾病）患者服用肌酸（我相信是每天20克）确实改善了他们的认知功能。所以，这是一个全新的领域，我们现在正在研究肌酸在大脑中的作用，而不仅仅是健身人士的肌肉效应，而是它如何影响大脑，对认知、大脑老化和抑郁症有益。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

It's fascinating. I mean, depression is a type of brain stress, right? I mean, we know inflammation plays a role in in depression. We know oxidative stress plays a role in depression. And there have now been some animal studies that have shown creatine is somehow having an anti-inflammatory effect. I that hasn't all been worked out. So I don't know if it's all just the energy component of it. It could also be this other sort of newly identified role that creatine is playing in sort of having an anti-inflammatory effect. And I don't know much enough about that. I don't know that there's enough even known about that. But I do know that it exists. And it's fascinating because again I think where creatine really shines in the brain and it's been shown study after study is under some kind of stressful condition depression or sleep deprivation or there's a new study that came out it was published I don't know a month ago or so showing that it was a very small pilot study and I want to caveat this there was no placebo control but it did show that giving people with Alzheimer's disease creatine I believe it was 20 grams a day did improve their cognition. And so again, this is a whole new field where now we're looking at creatine in the brain, not just the gym bro Bros and not just the muscular effects, but in the brain and how it's affecting the brain and being beneficial for cognition, for brain aging, for depression.

### 神经可塑性：大脑改变的潜力

这是第四个被重播最多的时刻。在你的工作中，我听到的最鼓舞人心、最具解放意义的观点之一是**神经可塑性**（Neuroplasticity: 大脑根据经验和学习改变其结构和功能的能力）这个概念。因为如果大脑可以根据我的行为进行生理上的改变，那就意味着我现在的身份，那个16、19岁时与雪貂一起睡在睡袋里的我，不一定是我必须永远成为的样子。我真的可以改变。我们已经讨论了一些关于什么会引起改变的动机，但知道我的大脑真的会改变，这两件事对我来说非常鼓舞人心，因为这意味着我所陷入的任何困境不一定是永久的。你说改变的动机来源于恐惧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Here's the fourth most replayed moment. One of the most inspiring and I think liberating things that I've heard in your work is this idea of neuroplasticity. Because if you're if the brain can physiologically change based on what I'm doing, then it means that who I am now, my identity, that 16 that 19-year-old who's sleeping in the mummy thing with the ferret isn't who I always have to be. I can literally change. Um, we've spoken a little bit around like what causes the motivation to actually change, but knowing that there's a my brain will actually change. Those two things are really inspiring for me because it means that whatever rut I'm stuck in isn't necessarily a permanent one. Now, you said that the motivation to change comes from fear.

</details>

### 恐惧与爱的驱动力

在我的案例中，确实是恐惧，害怕成为一个永久的失败者，才激发了巨大的改变。我相信，我们最出色、最有创造性的工作来源于对技艺的热爱。但有时，为了找到你真正热爱的东西，你必须被恐惧驱使，踏上一条寻找它的道路。所以，**神经可塑性**绝对是真实的。如果问题是：一个人能否改变？你能否学习新事物？你能否改掉某些习惯？你能否在任何年龄克服创伤？答案是绝对肯定的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Well, in my case, it took a a fear circumstance, fear of becoming a permanent failure. Yeah. To motivate immense change. And um uh that was that circumstance. I I do believe however that the best work, our most creative and best work comes from a love of craft. But sometimes in order to find what you truly love, you have to be scared into setting off on a path to find it. So neuroplasticity is absolutely real. But if the question is can a person change, can you learn new things? Can you unlearn certain patterns? Can you overcome traumas at any age? The answer is absolutely categorically yes.

</details>

### 大脑改变的机制与成年人学习

如何改变？很明显，在儿童时期直到大约25岁左右，仅仅是被动经验就能塑造大脑，无论是好是坏。大约25岁以后，我们仍然可以改变大脑，但这需要**神经化学环境**（Neurochemical Environment: 大脑中神经递质、激素等化学物质的平衡状态）发生显著变化。这就是为什么任何创伤事件都会永远被记住的原因之一，尽管你可以消除创伤的一些情感负荷，它不一定永远是创伤性的。这是因为当我们看到或经历非常强烈、恐惧性质的事情时，会释放某些**神经调节剂**（Neuromodulators: 调节神经元活动的化学物质），如**肾上腺素**（Epinephrine: 一种神经递质和激素，能提高警觉性和能量）和**去甲肾上腺素**（Norepinephrine: 一种神经递质和激素，影响警觉性和注意力），这些物质会引起我们身体和大脑的状态转变。神经系统将其识别为异常，因此在随后的几天里，连接会重新排序，以便大脑为再次发生此类事件做好准备。这就是为什么我们有所谓的**一次性学习**（One-trial Learning: 仅通过一次经验就能形成持久记忆的学习方式）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

How? Well, it's very clear that as a child until about age 25, more or less just passive experience will shape the brain for better or worse. After about age 25, and again these are not strict cut offs, we can change our brain. But what's required is a marketked shift in the neurochemical environment under which something happens. So one of the reasons why any traumatic event will forever be remembered although by the way you can remove some of the emotional load of that trauma does not have to be traumatic forever is because when we see or experience something very intense of a fearful nature there is the release of certain what we call neurom modulators things like epinephrine adrenaline and other neurom modulators that cause a state shift in our broad body and brain And the nervous system recognizes this as unusual and as a consequence in the subsequent days there's reordering of the connections so that the brain can prepare for that event should it happen again. This is why we have what's called one trial learning.

</details>

### 注意力与神经化学变化

你去某个地方，那里发生了可怕的事情，你就会永远将那个地方与可怕的事情联系起来。但有一些工具，比如疗法，可以消除这种情感负荷，让你能够平静地去那个地方，不再感到恐惧。好消息是，只要神经化学环境发生变化，你也可以学习任何你想学的东西。这就是为什么当我们对某事非常感兴趣并专注于某事时（这是神经可塑性的两个主要要求），我们必须保持警觉和专注。作为成年人，我们不能被动学习。我们不能只是在房间里播放关于**人工智能**（AI: Artificial Intelligence: 模拟人类智能的机器系统）和**大型语言模型**（Large Language Model: 基于海量文本训练的 AI 系统）或神经科学的讲座，然后知识就能通过**渗透**（Osmosis: 知识被动吸收的比喻）进入大脑。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

You go to a certain location, something terrible happens there, you will forever associate that location with something terrible. But there are tools, therapy and other tools that can allow the emotional load to be removed from that so that you could go to that location and feel calm, no fear whatsoever. The good news is you can also learn anything you want to learn provided there's a shift in this neurochemical environment. This is why when we are very interested and focused on something, two of the main requirements for neuroplasticity, we have to be alert and we have to be focused. We can't learn passively as adults. We can't just play um you know a a lecture about AI and large language models or neuroscience in the room and then it just the knowledge doesn't just sink in by osmosis.

</details>

### 学习、睡眠与大脑重塑

但如果我们集中注意力并保持警觉，当我们集中注意力时，与注意力相关的**神经化学物质**（Neurochemicals: 神经系统中的化学物质，如神经递质）会发生变化。我们称之为**儿茶酚胺**（Catacolamines: 一组神经递质，包括多巴胺、肾上腺素和去甲肾上腺素）。这包括三种分子：**多巴胺**、**肾上腺素**和**去甲肾上腺素**。所有这些都会增加警觉性和专注力，收紧我们的视觉和听觉范围，就像注意力的锥形。然后，它会启动一系列生物过程，只要我们当晚（甚至可能第二天晚上）获得充足睡眠，神经连接就会重新排序，从而将这些知识和新经验巩固在大脑中。你将永远因这种经验而改变。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

But if we pay attention and we're alert when we pay attention there's a shift in the neurochemicals associated with that attention. What we call the catacolamines. It's three molecules dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine. All which cause an increase in alertness. all which cause an increase in focus, a tightening of our visual field and our auditory field. So like cones of attention is one way to think about it. And then it sets in motion a bunch of biological processes such that if we get adequate sleep that night, maybe the next night as well, there's reordering of neural connection so that that knowledge, that new experience is consolidated in your brain. You are forever changed as a consequence of that experience.

</details>

### 大脑改变的条件与成年人学习

所以，当我们听说大脑不断变化，我们遇到的每件事都会改变我们的大脑时，这并不完全正确。除非有必要，否则大脑为什么要改变呢？对吧？作为儿童，大脑基本上是为改变而设计的模板，它试图理解环境并做出预测。所以，神经可塑性是儿童期、青春期和青少年时期的主要特征。想想你青少年时期听的音乐，没有其他音乐能有那么大的意义。那是因为青少年时期，你的身体充满了**荷尔蒙**（Hormones: 由内分泌腺分泌的化学信使）和**神经调节剂**，这使得青少年时期看似微不足道的事件也具有巨大的意义。那首歌意义重大，就是因为你体内产生的神经化学环境。但作为成年人，正如我们所说，需要更强的刺激。神经系统在这方面非常高效。除非必须改变，否则它不会改变，但如果需要为了你的安全而改变，它总会改变。这就是为什么恐惧的影响比单纯的兴趣更能改变我们的大脑。但很高兴知道爱、兴奋和欣赏也是改变大脑的强大刺激。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So when we hear that the brain is constantly changing, everything that we encounter changes our brain, that's not true. Why would the brain change unless it needed to, right? As a child, the brain is basically a template for change. It's it's trying to understand the environment and make predictions. And so that's true. Neuroplasticity is is a cardinal feature of of childhood and adolescence and the teen years. Just think about the music you listen to when you were a teen. No other music will ever have as much significance. And that's because as a teen your body is flooded with hormones and neurom modulators that the amount of meaning that comes from now seemingly trivial events when you're a teenager or adolescent is immense. That song meant so much and it's because of the neurochemical meu it creates in you. But as an adult it takes a stronger stimulus as we say. The nervous system is very um efficient in that way. It doesn't change unless it has to and it always changes if it needs to in order to keep you safe. This is why there's an asymmetric influence of fear as opposed to um just interest in terms of what will shift our brain. But it's nice to know that love and excitement and appreciation are very strong stimula for changing the brain.

</details>

### 神经可塑性与终身学习

从我们所了解的神经科学来看，很清楚的是，无论你是90岁、70岁还是50岁，如果你想学习，你就能学习。这种学习通过**神经可塑性**发生，即神经连接的重新排序，某些连接的加强，另一些连接的减弱，在少数情况下，还会增加新的神经元。你绝对可以改变你的大脑，但你必须专注于你想融入大脑的事物。你必须在做这件事时保持警觉。然后，你绝对必须去休息，因为大脑的实际重新布线发生在睡眠、冥想状态和休息期间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

From everything we know about neuroscience, it's clear that doesn't matter if you're 90 years old, 70 years old, 50 years old, if you want to learn, you can learn. And that learning occurs through neuroplasticity, which is the reordering of neural connections, strengthening of certain connections, weakening of others, and in some rare cases, the addition of new neurons. But you absolutely can change your brain, but you have to pay attention to the thing you want to incorporate into your brain. You have to be alert while you do that. And then you absolutely have to go get some rest because it's during sleep and during meditative states and during rest that the actual rewiring of the brain occurs.

这是第三个被重播最多的时刻。对于那些刚刚点击收听这个对话的人，你能告诉他们你的使命以及为什么它如此重要吗？非常感谢你与我进行这次对话。我认为这说明了问题所在，对吧？像你这样见多识广的人，竟然不知道**一氧化氮**（Nitric Oxide: 一种气体分子，在人体内作为信号分子，调节血流和氧气输送）。所以，我们必须区分**一氧化氮**（NO）和**一氧化二氮**（Nitrous Oxide: N2O，俗称笑气，用作麻醉剂）。一氧化二氮是一种麻醉剂，是一种气体，被称为笑气。我们谈论的是一氧化氮，一个氮原子，一个氧原子。这个分子是人类健康和长寿的基础。

Here is the third most replayed moment. For those people who have just clicked to listen to this conversation, can you tell them the mission you're on and why it's so important? Yeah. Well, thanks so much for having this conversation with me. I think that illustrates the problem, right? someone as informed as you don't know anything or never heard of nitric oxide. So, it's important for us to just make a distinction between um like nitric gas that people, you know, inhale and that used if you played like uh some of those racing car games, you press a button and the car goes really fast. If you That's nitrous nitrous. These are two separate things. No, very Yeah, very good point. So, this is not nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide is I mean a medicine is a dental anesthetic, right? It's a gas. It's called laughing gas. That's N2O. That's the chemical formula. What we're talking about is nitric oxide or NO. One nitrogen, one oxygen. This molecule is is foundational for human health and longevity.

### 一氧化氮的功能与心血管健康

**一氧化氮**是一种气体，是一种天然产生的分子，是人体内的**信号分子**（Signaling Molecule: 在细胞之间传递信息的分子）。它调节血流和氧气输送，动员我们自身的**干细胞**（Stem Cells: 具有自我更新和分化能力的细胞）帮助我们恢复、修复和替换功能失调的细胞。它能改善细胞内的能量产生，并调节血流。一氧化氮是一种气体，在**内皮**（Endothelium: 血管内壁的单层细胞）中产生。内皮是遍布全身所有血管内壁的单层细胞。这些**内皮细胞**（Endothelial Cells: 构成血管内壁的细胞）的功能是调节血管张力，调节溶质交换以及分子穿过内皮层的外渗或转运。当你的内皮细胞无法再产生一氧化氮气体时，它们就不再扩张。于是血管会收缩，你开始出现炎症，动脉变硬，斑块沉积，这就是**心血管疾病**（Cardiovascular Disease: 影响心脏和血管的疾病）或**动脉粥样硬化**（Artherosclerosis: 动脉壁上斑块积聚导致动脉硬化和狭窄的疾病）的开始。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So nitric oxide is a gas. It's a naturally produced molecule. It's a signaling molecule in the human body. And so it's it regulates things like blood flow and oxygen delivery. And it mobilizes our own stem cells to help us recover and repair and replace dysfunctional cells. it uh improves energy production inside the cell and it regulates blood flow. So nitric oxide is a gas. It's produced in the endthelium. So the endothelium is the single layer of cells that line every blood vessel throughout the body. So the function of these endothelial cells is to regulate vascular tone and to regulate you know solute exchange and extravisation or transport of molecules across that endothelial layer. And so when your endthelial cells can no longer make nitric oxide gas, they no longer dilate. So the blood vessels become constricted. You start to get inflammation. You get stiff arteries, plaque deposition, and that's what starts cardiovascular disease orthoscerosis.

### 一氧化氮缺乏的后果

所以，一氧化氮是一种化学物质，存在于我身体所有的血细胞中，它能让我的血细胞扩张，打开，让血液流过。它能扩张**平滑肌**（Smooth Muscle: 构成内脏器官和血管壁的非随意肌），所以它不直接影响细胞本身，而是扩张血管周围的平滑肌，从而导致放松和扩张。我的血管会扩张，更多的血液会流过。但如果我缺乏一氧化氮，这种机制就无法运作，我的血管就不会扩张，最终通过肌肉放松而扩张。因此，我的血压会升高，这可能导致一系列下游疾病和后果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So let me get this straight. I'll repeat back to you what I think I understand about nitric oxide. And you tell me if it's accurate. So this nitric oxide is a chemical that is in all the blood cells of my body and it allows my blood cells to basically expand open up so blood can flow through there. So if I it dilates it dilates the smooth muscle. So it's not affecting the cells per se but it's dilating the smooth muscle that surrounds the blood vessels which leads to re relaxation and dilation. Fine. So my blood cells would then expand your blood vessels and more blood would go through there. But if I'm deficient, that mechanism doesn't work and my blood cells wouldn't expand ultimately expand through the relaxation of the muscles. That's right. And therefore, I would have higher blood pressure, which can lead to a series of downstream diseases and consequences.

### 一氧化氮缺乏与慢性疾病

我们看到，20岁左右的年轻人体内**一氧化氮**水平是最佳的。然后从30岁到70岁，一氧化氮水平会急剧下降80-90%。一氧化氮水平下降会导致一系列慢性疾病。你能列举一些与一氧化氮缺乏相关的慢性疾病吗？我们已经提到过，比如**勃起功能障碍**（Erectile Dysfunction: 男性无法达到或维持勃起）。男性和女性的勃起都依赖于血管扩张以增加血流量。我们称之为“**煤矿里的金丝雀**”（Canary in the Coal Mine: 早期预警信号），因为多年来人们认为这是一种生活方式疾病。但现在，它被认为是**一氧化氮缺失**的症状，实际上是**心血管疾病**加速发展的一种形式，导致**高血压**（High Blood Pressure: 血压持续高于正常水平）、**代谢疾病**（Metabolic Disease: 影响新陈代谢过程的疾病）和**糖尿病**（Diabetes: 一种慢性代谢疾病，以高血糖为特征）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And so when we look at the graph that I showed a second ago where we're seeing for anyone that can't see this graph because you're listening on audio, we're seeing nitric oxide levels in young people up to the age of roughly around 20 are optimal. And then from about 30 to 70, there's this tremendous sort of 80 90% drop. in terms of chronic disease that is downstream from me losing nitric oxide level. Can you give me a bit of a menu of chronic disease that is associated with this nitric oxide deficiency? Yep. We've touched on them. So erectile dysfunction. So in erections in both men and women are dependent upon dilation of the blood vessels to get engorgment to get increase in blood flow. And that's what an erection is. And we call that the canary in the coal mine because for years people thought it was a lifestyle disorder. Right. Well, erectile dysfunction. Yeah. But now it's recognized that it's a symptom of loss of nitric oxide and really an accelerated form of cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, metabolic disease, and diabetes.

### 一氧化氮与阿尔茨海默病

另一个是**阿尔茨海默病**，因为阿尔茨海默病是一种**血管疾病**（Vascular Disease: 影响血管的疾病）。一氧化氮能纠正我们所知的所有关于阿尔茨海默病的问题。它能改善大脑的血流量，提高葡萄糖摄取，从而克服阿尔茨海默病的代谢方面问题。它能减少炎症，实际上，我的许多专利都涉及一种减少炎症的方法。它能抑制我们在阿尔茨海默病和神经系统疾病中看到的**氧化应激**（Oxidative Stress: 体内自由基和抗氧化剂失衡导致细胞损伤的状态），并预防**免疫功能障碍**（Immune Dysfunction: 免疫系统功能异常）。当你做到这些，当你恢复血流，输送营养和氧气，并清除代谢废物时，就不会出现蛋白质错误折叠，你就不会出现**淀粉样斑块**（Amyloid Plaque: 阿尔茨海默病患者大脑中发现的异常蛋白质沉积）和**神经纤维缠结**（Neurofibrillary Tangles: 阿尔茨海默病患者大脑中发现的异常蛋白质缠结）。所以，我绝对相信**一氧化氮气体**这个简单的分子将根除并治愈阿尔茨海默病。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And then the other one is uh obviously Alzheimer's because Alzheimer's is a vascular disease. And nitric oxide corrects every single thing we know about Alzheimer's. It improves blood flow to the brain. It improves glucose uptake. So, it overcomes the metabolic aspect of Alzheimer's. It reduces inflammation. In fact, a number of my patents on a method of reducing inflammation. It inhibits the oxidative stress we see in in Alzheimer's and neurological disease. And it prevents the immune dysfunction. And when you do that, when you restore blood flow and you get nutrients and oxygen in and you take out the metabolic waste products, there's no misfolding of protein. So, you don't get the amaloid plaque, you don't get the tangles. So this simple molecule nitric oxide gas I'm absolutely convinced will eradicate and cure Alzheimer's

### 一氧化氮治疗阿尔茨海默病的挑战

真的吗？因为它解决了阿尔茨海默病的每一个生理根本原因。如果能足够早地对患者进行治疗性给药。我认为这非常关键，因为任何临床试验中任何药物的成功或失败都取决于临床试验的设计，以及你招募的患者处于疾病的哪个阶段。所以，纳入标准和排除标准很重要。每种疾病，无论是心脏病、肾病还是阿尔茨海默病，都有一个不可逆转的阶段。一旦疾病发展到不可逆转的状态，就真的没有医疗疗法能逆转它了。所以，我认为我们要做的是在早期阶段治疗患者，我们称之为**血管性痴呆**（Vascular Dementia: 由脑部血管问题引起的痴呆）、**轻度认知障碍**（Mild Cognitive Impairment: 介于正常衰老和痴呆之间的认知问题）和**早期阿尔茨海默病**。因为我想证明两件事：第一，一旦疾病开始，我们能否阻止其进展？第二，我们希望招募足够晚期的患者，以显示疾病的**逆转**（Regression: 疾病症状或进展的减轻）。所以，这是一个非常具体和有限的患者群体。在设计临床研究时，最坏的情况是阻止疾病进展，最好的情况是显示疾病可以逆转。这就是治疗的目标：你理解疾病的机制，从而能够治疗、预防、逆转和治愈它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

really because it it addresses every physiological root cause of Alzheimer's if you can get it administered therapeutically to patients early enough or no I think that's a very key because the success or failure of any clinical trial any drug in any clinical trial is dependent upon the design of the clinical trial and what patients at what stage of disease that you enroll these patients. So what are the inclusion criteria and what are the exclusion criteria and there's a stage in every disease whether it's heart disease, kidney disease, Alzheimer's where you've reached a point of no return. There's really no medical therapy that's going to reverse that disease because it's progressed to a state that's irreversible. So I think what we try to do is take take patients early in the process what we call vascular dementia mild cognitive impairment early Alzheimer's because what I want to be able to demonstrate is two things number one can we stop the progression of disease once it's started can we stop the progression and then number two is we want to enroll patients far enough along to where we can show regression so can you move can you move the needle back and so That's a very kind of a specific and finite patient population. When you design a clinical study, number one, at the at the absolute worst, we want to stop progression. At the absolute best, we want to show that we can regress disease. And that's the goal of therapy is that you understand the mechanism of disease to the extent that you can treat it, you can prevent it, you can reverse it, and you can cure it.

### 饮食与一氧化氮生成

当我思考食物在我的**一氧化氮**生成中扮演的角色时，我应该吃什么来增加或保持健康的一氧化氮水平？我认为答案也是一样的。与其说我们应该吃什么，不如说我们不应该吃什么。首先，你必须避免糖和**高血糖指数食物**（High Glycemic Index Foods: 导致血糖快速升高的食物），因为糖是一种毒素。想想糖是什么。当我们吃糖或喝含糖饮料时，无论是蔗糖、果糖还是**高果糖玉米糖浆**（High Fructose Corn Syrup: 一种常见的甜味剂），最终结果是人体内的葡萄糖增加。血糖或血葡萄糖升高就是糖尿病，对吧？现在有**连续血糖监测仪**（Continuous Glucose Monitors: 实时监测血糖水平的设备），随处可见，每个人都在用。所以，如果你吃了某种食物导致血糖升高，你就应该避免它，因为葡萄糖，顾名思义，就是“胶水”，它很黏。如果你把汽水洒在台面上，第二天回来，它会很黏，对吧？这就是身体内部发生的情况。糖会粘附在所有东西上，粘附在蛋白质上，粘附在酶上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

When I think about the role that food plays in my nitric oxide production, what should I be eating to increase um my nitric oxide levels or to keep them at a healthy level? I think it the same answer is for that too. It's it's not so much what we should be eating, it's what we should not be eating. Okay, so we we'll we'll cover those step by step. Number one, you have to avoid sugar and high glycemic index foods because sugar is a toxin. It's a poison. And let's think about what sugar is. So when we eat sugar or drink sugar beverages, right? Whether it's sucrose, whether it's fructose, whether it's high fructose corn syrup, the end result inside the human is we see an increase in glucose. So elevation in blood sugar or blood glucose is diabetes, right? And now there's continuous glucose monitors that you can get anywhere and everybody does this. So if you eat something and it causes an increase in your blood sugar, blood glucose, then you should avoid that because glucose as the name implies is glue, right? It's sticky. And if we if you have a soda and you spill it on your countertop, you come back the next day, it's sticky, right? Well, that's what happens inside the body. That sugar sticks to everything. It sticks to proteins. It sticks to enzymes.

### 糖对一氧化氮生成和健康的危害

糖会降低**一氧化氮**的生成。没错。这就是为什么糖尿病患者心脏病发作、中风和全因死亡率高出10倍的原因。这就是为什么他们会发展出神经或**周围神经病变**（Peripheral Neuropathy: 影响周围神经的疾病）。这就是为什么他们会有难以愈合的伤口，因为没有一氧化氮。这就是为什么他们会发展出**糖尿病视网膜病变**（Diabetic Retinopathy: 糖尿病引起的视网膜损伤）、**黄斑变性**（Macular Degeneration: 导致中心视力丧失的眼部疾病）和**胰腺炎**（Pancreatitis: 胰腺炎症）。所有这些都可以追溯到一氧化氮生成不足，因为糖粘附在酶上。糖会破坏**口腔微生物组**（Oral Microbiome: 口腔内的微生物群落），完全改变细菌生态，并完全关闭一氧化氮的生成。那么，我们应该吃什么呢？我认为你必须适度地均衡饮食。美国人营养过剩。你只需四处走走，就能看到肥胖症的流行。高质量的蛋白质，高质量的脂肪，以及少量或不含碳水化合物。就这么简单。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And it lowers nitric oxide production. Absolutely. That's why diabetics have a 10 times higher incidence of heart attack, stroke, all cause mortality mortality. That's why they develop neur neurological or peripheral neuropathy. That's why they have non-healing wounds. There's no nitric oxide. That's why they're developing diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, pancreatitis. I mean, all of that can be traced back to a lack of nitric oxide production because the sugar is stuck to the enzyme. The sugar destroys the oral microbiome and completely changes the the ecology of the bacteria and completely shuts down nitric oxide production. Right? But I think to answer your question, what should we be eating? I think you've got to eat a balanced diet in moderation. You know, Americans are overfed. All you got to do is walk around and see the the epidemic of obesity. good high quality protein, good quality fats, and little or no carbs. And it's really that simple.

### 协调性运动与大脑健康

这是第二个被重播最多的时刻。当你想到目前流行和时髦的行为和习惯时，有没有哪些你认为对大脑特别好或特别坏的？我脑海中浮现了几个想问你的。目前在英国非常流行的一种运动是**板式网球**（Paddle: 一种类似网球的球拍运动），我想你们这里称之为**匹克球**（Pickleball: 一种结合网球、羽毛球和乒乓球元素的球拍运动）。它对我的大脑是好是坏？它对你的大脑非常好，因为它能锻炼你的**小脑**（Cerebellum: 大脑中负责协调和平衡的区域）。当你通过协调性练习激活小脑时，它会进一步激活你的**额叶**（Frontal Lobes: 大脑中负责决策、规划和高级认知功能的区域）。这是否意味着不协调的人有小脑问题？是的。真的吗？是的。你做得越多，协调性就越好。这就是为什么儿童需要协调性练习。所以，我们谈到儿童时，你希望他们从小就进行这些练习。让他们参加体育运动，但不是那种会造成头部受伤的运动。

<summary>Original English</summary>

Here's the second most replayed moment. When you think about behaviors and habits that are popular and trendy at the moment, are there any that stand out to you as being particularly good for the brain or particularly bad for the brain? Cuz I had a couple come to mind that I wanted to throw at you. I mean, one of them that's exploding in the UK at the moment is paddle, which is kind of I think you call it pickle ball here. Good for my brain, bad for my brain. It's so good for your brain because it's working your cerebellum. And I told you that because yours was sleepy and as you activate this and you do that with coordination exercises, it then activates your frontal loes. Does that mean that people that are uncoordinated have a cerebellum issue? Yes. Oh, really? Okay. And the more you do it, the better coordination you develop. And that's why coordination exercises for kids. So, we talked about kids is you want to do that with them early. Play sports, but not sports where they're going to get a head injury, right?

### 运动与新学习的结合

我们必须比现在更聪明。我年轻的时候，我93岁的母亲是社区的乒乓球冠军，她非常厉害，从不让我们赢，直到我们能打败她。但她总是鼓励我们。我一直在思考目前对大脑好或坏的不同趋势，其中一个大趋势是**神经可塑性训练**（Neuroplasticity Training: 旨在改善大脑可塑性的训练）。很多人在玩游戏，使用其他东西，比如有神经可塑性训练应用程序。这些东西有效吗？有些有效。例如，如果你在玩记忆游戏，可以在骑自行车时玩。不是在街上，而是在固定自行车上玩这些游戏。研究发现，运动能增加流向**海马体**的血流量，这意味着你更有可能记住它，并在过程中强化你的大脑。所以，**运动与新学习相结合**，效果惊人。如果你想学习新东西，应该在走路或运动时进行，对吧？例如，如果你在听语言学习应用程序，可以在走路时听。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

I mean, we have to be smarter than we are. Um, but when I was young, my mother, who's now 93, was the pingpong champion in the neighborhood, and she was really good, and she never let us beat her until we could and but she was always encouraging. I've got um I was looking then as you were speaking about different trends at the moment that are either good or bad for the brain and one big trend at the moment is neuroplasticity training. Lots of people are doing games and using other things to like there's apps you can get that are neuroplasticity training apps. Does any of that stuff work? Some of it some of it works. And if you're so for example, if you're doing memorization games, do them while you're on the bike. Now, not in the street, but if you're on a stationary bike and you're doing those games, it's been found that exercise increases blood flow to the hippocampus, meaning you're more likely to remember it and you're strengthening your brain in the process. So, exercise with new learning, stunning. So if I want to learn something, I should do it while walking or moving in motion, right? So if you're listening to a language app, for example, do it while you're walking.

### 正念冥想与工作对大脑的影响

**正念**（Mindfulness: 专注于当下，不加评判的意识状态）和**冥想**（Meditation: 通过专注或放松来训练注意力和意识的实践），对大脑是好是坏？非常好。我发表了三项关于一种名为**Kirtan Kriya**（Kirtan Kriya: 一种昆达里尼瑜伽冥想形式）的**昆达里尼瑜伽**（Kundalini Yoga: 一种结合呼吸、体式、手印、唱诵和冥想的瑜伽形式）冥想形式的研究。这是一种12分钟的冥想。我总是说它是完美的**注意力缺陷多动症**（ADD: Attention Deficit Disorder: 一种神经发育障碍，表现为注意力不集中、多动和冲动）冥想，因为它只有12分钟。在这12分钟里，你做“Sa Ta Na Ma”的唱诵。两分钟大声唱，两分钟低声耳语，四分钟默念，再两分钟低声耳语，两分钟大声唱，就完成了。**Sa Ta Na Ma**代表出生、生命、死亡、重生。我们研究的这个冥想能激活你的小脑，激活你的额叶，并平静你的**情绪大脑**（Emotional Brain: 大脑中处理情感的区域）。那些坚持12分钟冥想8周的人，他们的静息额叶功能更强。这很简单。我认为这是专注的注意力加上协调性冥想。热爱你的工作对大脑是好是坏？绝对对大脑非常好，如果你在学习新事物。那些工作不需要新学习的人，患阿尔茨海默病的几率更高。所以，如果你的工作停滞不前，患阿尔茨海默病的风险就更高。

Mindfulness and meditation, good or bad for the brain. Great. I published three studies on a condundolini yoga form of meditation called kin crea. It's a 12minute meditation. I always say it's the perfect ADD meditation because it's only 12 minutes. And for 12 minutes you do this. Sa m saw saw. It's two minutes out loud, two minutes whispering, four minutes silently to yourself. 2 minutes whispering, 2 minutes out loud, you're done. Satan ma, birth, life, death, reborn. Birth, life, death, reborn. But the one we studied is sat na ma. And so if they look it up, kitin crea um activates your cerebellum, activates your frontal loes, calms down your emotional brain. People who did that for 12 minutes for 8 weeks, their resting frontal lobe function was stronger. So simple. What the hell is going on there? I think it's the focused attention plus you're doing a coordination meditation s no s loving your job good or bad for the brain absolutely great for your brain if you're learning new things people who are in a job that does not require new learning have a higher incidence of Alzheimer's disease So if you're stagnant in your work, you have a higher risk of Alzheimer's.

### 工作压力与大脑健康

如果我整天只看脑部扫描，虽然我知道怎么做，但我没有学到任何新东西。所以我会做这些，但我也会写一些我不了解的东西，或者学习一些新东西。如果你与人合作，但你爱这份工作，但与人合作呢？对大脑不好。**慢性压力**（Chronic Stress: 长期持续的压力）会增加**皮质醇**（Cortisol: 一种由肾上腺分泌的激素，与压力反应有关）。我认为每个人都应该了解自己的基础皮质醇水平，因为皮质醇会使**海马体**萎缩，并在腹部堆积脂肪。这对你的大脑来说是两件非常糟糕的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And like if I just read brain scans all day, well, I know how to do it. I'm not learning anything new. So I do that, but I also am writing about something I don't know about. Um, or I'm learning something new. What if you're working with I'm sorry. I love the job, but I'm working with Bad for your brain. Chronic stress increases cortisol. And I think everybody should sort of know their baseline cortisol level and cortisol shrinks the hippocampus and puts fat on your belly. So that's two very bad things for your brain.

### 呼吸法与社交媒体

**呼吸法**（Breath Work: 通过控制呼吸来影响身心状态的练习），这是一个很大的趋势。非常棒。你想打破恐慌发作吗？**15秒呼吸法**：吸气4秒，屏住1.5秒，呼气8秒，屏住1.5秒。你只需做四五次，你的整个神经系统就会平静下来。研究表明，呼气时间是吸气时间的两倍。这就是为什么吸气4秒，呼气8秒。它会改变你的神经系统，对吗？是的。它会增加一种叫做**迷走神经张力**（Vagal Tone: 迷走神经的活性水平，与放松和恢复有关）的东西。那么，一些不好的事情呢？**社交媒体使用**。长期使用社交媒体，对大脑是好是坏？对大脑不好，因为你不断地将自己与不真实的人进行比较。

And the research shows take twice as long to breathe out as you breathe in. That's why 4 seconds in, 8 seconds out. It shifts your nervous system, doesn't it? Yes. It increases something called veagal tone. Okay. Some bad things then. Social media usage. Chronic social media usage. Good for the brain, bad for the brain.

### 工作狂、微塑料与噪音污染

**工作狂**（Workaholism: 对工作过度沉迷）和**内卷文化**（Hustle Culture: 一种强调过度工作和不断追求成就的文化）呢？我热爱我的工作。我是否沉迷于它？我不知道。但我热爱它。当人们说工作狂对大脑不好时，那是因为他们正在做自己不喜欢的工作，或者只是为了钱而工作，没有其他目的。**微塑料**（Microplastics: 小于5毫米的塑料碎片），这是一个大问题。对大脑非常糟糕。它是**荷尔蒙紊乱**（Hormone Disruption: 激素平衡被干扰）和癌症的主要原因之一，以及其他环境问题。谢谢你没有给我塑料水瓶。是的，没关系。想象一下，如果我们这样做。我们现在花了很多时间讨论微塑料和其他环境毒素，我认为人们现在越来越意识到这些，这是好事。**噪音污染**对大脑不好，如果它损害你的听力，**听力损失**（Hearing Loss: 听力受损）实际上是阿尔茨海默病的风险因素之一。为什么？因为你没有获得输入，对吧？如果你没有获得适当的输入，你的大脑就会开始萎缩。如果你听不到别人在说什么，并且你有很多负面想法，你就会有很高的**负面偏见**（Negativity Bias: 倾向于更关注和记住负面信息），你实际上可能会变得有点偏执，并用负面情绪填补空白。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

What about workcoholism and hustle culture? So, I love my work. Am I addicted to it? I don't know. But I love it. When they say people are workaholics and it's bad for the brain, it's they're working with or doing something they don't like or doing it for the money but without other purpose. Microplastics, that's a big awful for the brain. One of the major causes of hormone disruption and cancer. and other environment. Thank you for not giving me a plastic water bottle. Yeah, it's okay. Imagine imagine if we did that when we spend a long a lot of time these days talking about the microplastics and other environmental toxins that I think people are becoming more aware of now which is good noise pollution bad for the brain and if if it hurts your hearing hearing loss is actually one of the risk factors for Alzheimer's. Why is that? I did a I did a Because you're not getting input, right? And if you're not getting appropriate input, your brain starts to atrophy. And if you don't hear what other people are saying and you have a lot of ants, you have a high negativity bias is you can actually begin to get a bit paranoid and fill in the empty spaces with negativity.

### 听力损失与阿尔茨海默病风险

我刚买了一副新的**Apple AirPods**（Apple AirPods: 苹果公司生产的无线耳机），当我连接到手机时，它问我是否想做听力测试。所以我做了听力测试，然后我问我女朋友，我说：“你也应该做这个听力测试。”因为我需要一些东西来比较。我有点震惊。它说我还没有失去任何听力，但我的听力明显不如她。我当时想，天哪，这……但我完全不知道它与阿尔茨海默病有关。所以我现在第一次调低了音量，因为我认为无论你做什么，听力都会随着年龄的增长而下降。但正如你之前所说，从更好的基线开始，在谈论**大脑储备**（Brain Reserves: 大脑应对损伤和衰老的能力）时，我认为这才是老化的关键。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

I just bought some new Apple AirPods and when I connected them to my phone, it said, "You want to do a hearing test?" So, I did the hearing test and then I asked my girlfriend, I said, "You should do this hearing test as well." Cuz I needed something to compare it to. And I was a little bit shocked. Um, it said I hadn't lost any hearing yet, but my hearing was significantly not as good as hers. And I remember thinking, gosh, you know, this is, but I didn't have any idea that it was linked to Alzheimer's at all. So now I've turned down the volume for the first time in my life because I think your hearing declines regardless really of what you do with age anyway. Um but as you said earlier like starting from a better baseline when you're talking about the brain reserves is really the game I think with aging.

### 人工智能对大脑的影响

我的最后一个问题似乎与此无关，但世界正走向一个由**人工智能**驱动的世界。如果你上网，现在到处都在谈论它。人们谈论他们将失去工作。所有这些新工具都允许我们以各种不同的方式优化我们的生活。当你想到我们正在进入的人工智能世界时，我想象它在很多方面都会让你的工作更容易，比如作为一名大脑扫描师等等。但你认为人工智能对我们的大脑是好是坏？我认为短期内它会是坏的，因为你的大脑会做得更少，这对大脑不好。我认为观察接下来会发生什么很有趣。最终，用我的朋友**拜伦·凯蒂**（Byron Katy）的话说：“与现实争辩，欢迎来到地狱。”我们需要弄清楚如何利用它来提升我们的生活，而不是窃取大脑的发展。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

My last point is uh my last question is a bit of a seems to be uncorrelated but the world is heading towards a world that's driven by artificial intelligence. It's like all the all the rage at the moment if you log on the internet. People talking about they're going to lose their jobs. All of these new tools that allow us to optimize our lives in a variety of different ways. When you think about the world of AI that we're heading into, there's so many ways that I imagine it's going to make your job easier as someone who's doing scans of brains and so on. But do you think artificial intelligence is going to be good or bad for our brains? I think in the short run it's going to be bad because your brain is going to do less and that's bad for the brain. I I think it's fascinating to watch what's going to happen. And ultimately, in the words of my friend Byron Katy, argue with reality, welcome to hell. We need to figure out how to use it to enhance our lives rather than to steal brain development.

### 姜黄素与大脑健康

这是第一个被重播最多的时刻。2007年的一项研究表明，**姜黄素**（Curcumin: 姜黄中的活性成分）能上调抗氧化防御，下调氧化应激。2016年的一项研究，这是一项随机对照试验的**荟萃分析**（Meta-analysis: 对多项独立研究结果进行综合分析的方法），发现姜黄素在缓解疼痛方面与**布洛芬**（Ibuprofen: 一种非甾体抗炎药，用于止痛和消炎）相当。是的，关于姜黄素和**姜黄**（Turmeric: 一种香料，含有姜黄素）有很多研究。我说过，很多人会混淆，他们认为只有吸收到血液中才有效，但我说实际上并非如此。你需要与**微生物组**（Microbiome: 特定环境中所有微生物的集合）合作，使其发挥作用。目前正在进行早期的临床前研究，探讨它对癌症的影响。也有有前景但早期的研究表明，来自姜黄的姜黄素对大脑健康有影响。

Here's the first most replayed moment. There was a study done in 2007 that showed Can't even say it. Curcumin. That shows curcumin upregulates anti-oxidant defenses and downregulates oxidative stress. Yeah. There was a study done in 2016 which is a meta analysis of random control trials found curcuminium comparable to ibuprofen in terms of pain relief. Yeah, there there's a lot of work on kurcamin and turmeric. As I said, a lot of people get confused because they think the it only works if you absorb it into the blood and I'm saying that actually you don't. What you do is you work with the microbiome to make it useful. And there's early preclinical studies taking place around the impact it can have with cancers. And there's promising but early studies showing the impact that curcumin that comes from turmeric can have on brain health.

### 血脑屏障与植物性食物

是的，研究重点正在转向大脑的血液供应，我们称之为大脑的**血管效应**（Vascular Effects: 血管对器官功能的影响）。我们过去称之为**血脑屏障**（Blood-brain Barrier: 保护大脑免受血液中有害物质侵害的屏障），你可能听说过，它被认为是阻止许多物质进入大脑并可能扰乱大脑的地方。我们现在知道，这个血脑屏障是一个非常动态有趣的界面，介于大脑组织和我们身体的其他部分之间。它现在被称为**神经血管单元**（Neurovascular Unit: NVU: 构成血脑屏障的细胞和血管结构），这非常令人兴奋。我们越是研究它，就越发现帮助神经血管单元、血脑屏障的东西是**植物**。我们有**绿茶**。如果你真的想帮助我们的大脑健康，定期饮用绿茶被证明非常有用。

Yes. Well, that's uh focus is switching on to the blood supply to the brain. What we call the vascular effects on the brain. And there's something that we used to call the blood brain barrier which you've probably heard of which is seen to be the place where the barrier that stops a lot of stuff entering the brain and potentially upsetting it. We now know this bloodb brain barrier is a very dynamic interesting interface between the brains tissue and the rest of us. It's now called the neurovvascular unit, NVU. And it is so exciting. And the more we look at it so far, the more we find that the things that help the neurovvascular unit, the bloodb brain barrier are plants. And we have green tea. And you know we can if you if you really want to help um our brain health regular drinking of green tea you know is has been shown to be really useful.

### 绿茶与迷迭香

绿茶富含**多酚**（Polyphenols: 植物中发现的具有抗氧化作用的化合物）。多酚就是这些颜色，在这种情况下是绿色。绿茶只是未经熏制加工的茶叶部分，它来自一种叫做**茶树**（Chameleia Senses: 茶叶的学名，即山茶属）的植物。绿茶中含有多种多酚，似乎在调节血脑屏障方面特别有效。我们讨论了大脑和身体其他部分之间的神经血管单元。有各种原因表明，经常饮用绿茶似乎与减少这类问题有关。什么样的问题？**痴呆症**类型的问题，以及随着年龄增长而出现的**认知衰退**（Cognitive Decline: 随着年龄增长，认知能力下降）。在那些大量饮用绿茶的文化中，他们发现痴呆症的发病率较低吗？是的。但这并不意味着存在因果关系。所以你需要其他一些东西来证实这一点。我们发现其他植物也可能在这方面有强大的作用。我提到了**迷迭香**（Rosemary: 一种香草植物）。现在，你只需按压并闻一下迷迭香，就能体会到它的美妙。

<summary>Original English</summary>

Not that rather than the supplement by the way is the drink that you have um oh I put it in here right so we can make it. So as you make that can you explain to me why green tea is a good idea because it contains a number of again polyphenols and polyphenols are those are these colors these colors yeah in this case it's green obviously and me green tea is just the smoked unprocessed part of the tea leaf so it's a plant called chameleia senses um so this is nice Japanese teapot. That's the sort of thing you'd have green tea in. And these are the mugs, but we've filled these up already with uh ginger and cinnamon. So, let's let's leave it for a moment, but we can while it's sitting there for a while. There are a number of these polyphenols in green tea that seem to be particularly effective in modulating that barrier. We talked about the neurovvascular unit between the brain and the rest of us. And um there's all sorts of reasons why regular consumption of green tea seems to be linked to less of this sort of trouble. What what sort of trouble? The dementia type problems, the cognitive decline as they get older. Do they find that in cultures where they drink a lot of green tea, they have less dementia? Yeah. But that doesn't mean there's a cause and effect. So you need a few other things to establish that. What we're finding is that other plants have very likely powerful effects in this area. And I mentioned the rosemary. Now all you need to do to appreciate rosemary is to press it and sniff.

### 迷迭香与记忆力

它闻起来真香。那不仅仅是好闻，因为你吸入的是**挥发油**（Volatile Oils: 具有芳香气味的植物提取物），它们散发出气味。当你吸入时，它们实际上会进入你的大脑，因为大脑的一部分实际上与外界相连，这被称为**嗅叶**（Olfactory Lobe: 大脑中处理嗅觉信息的区域）。当你吸入某种东西时，它会直接进入大脑，然后从那里进入**边缘系统**（Lymbic System: 大脑中与情感、记忆和动机相关的区域）。莎士比亚戏剧《**哈姆雷特**》（Hamlet）中有一句台词，年轻的**奥菲莉亚**（Ophelia）说：“迷迭香，那是为了记忆。”因为每个人都知道它能改善认知功能。当我在**马里兰州**（Maryland）的校园工作时，我们实际上对那些随着年龄增长在填字游戏方面遇到困难的人进行了迷迭香的临床试验，发现虽然这不是一项结论性研究，但有迹象表明它能改善这些人的认知或表现。此后还有其他研究强化了这一点。我想说，迷迭香是长期大脑健康值得关注的植物之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Oh, it smells so good. Really nice. That's not just nice because what you're doing there is you're inhaling volatile oils, the things that give the smell. And when you're inhaling, they're literally going into your brain because part of the brain actually reaches the outside world. It's called the alactory lobe. And when you inhale something, it literally moves into the brain and from there into the lyic system. Remember there's a line in a Shakespeare play called Hamlet Ailia the young lady says rosemary that's for remembrance because everyone knew that this improved cognitive functions and when I was in working on our campus in Maryland we actually did a clinical trial with rosemary in people with struggling with their crosswords you know as they get older and found that although it wasn't a conclusive study there were pointers to it's improving cognitive or performance in those people and there's been other studies since that re that reinforce that. I would say that rosemary is one of the ones to watch in terms of long-term brain health.

### 可可与大脑和心血管健康

还有一种叫做**GKO**的疗法，很多人都知道，它在欧洲被用作治疗心血管问题的处方药，已被证明可能有用，并使用与我们在这里和绿茶中看到的相同的机制。绿茶富含**多酚**，这些多酚与心脏和大脑健康、脂肪减少和癌症预防等益处相关。它有一种很好的薄荷味。你可以接受这种味道，对吧？我女朋友又来了，她对这些东西了如指掌。她总是对的。我早就学到了这个教训。我知道，对吧？我总是在播客上说，但她总是领先两三年，然后某个非常非常聪明的人来告诉我，而我却花了那两三年时间否认。别提**可可**（Cacao: 可可豆的原始形式，富含抗氧化剂）。如果你开始跟我谈论可可，不不不不不。她一直在告诉我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

There's another remedy called GKO that a lot of people know about which is used as a prescription medicine in Europe uh for cardiovascular problems and that's been shown to be likely useful and using the same sort of mechanisms as as we've seen here and with the green tea. I'll check it here. Yeah, that looks all right. You see, it's more yellow than green, but uh and this is flavored with a little bit of mint to make it a little more agreeable. Sometimes people find green tea is not their favorite taste. Green tea is rich in polyphenols, um which are linked to benefits ranging from heart and brain health to fat loss and cancer prevention. It's got a nice minty flavor. Yeah. You can live with that, couldn't you? Yeah. Yeah, my girlfriend again, she she's all over this stuff. She's always bloody right. Well, you know that learned that lesson a long time ago. I know, right? Like I say it all the time on this podcast, but she's always like 2, three years ahead of what then someone really, really smart comes and tells me and I spend those two or three years in denial. I'm like, what the is she like doing over there? Don't get me started on cacao. If you start talking to me about cacao, no, no, no, no, no. She's been telling me I'm gonna I'm gonna nail this because there's a lot of people listening who will want to hear this.

### 黑巧克力：一种“药物”

可可。是的，**巧克力**，**黑巧克力**（Dark Chocolate: 可可含量高的巧克力）是一种药物。结束。最好的药物之一是50克或100克75%或更高可可含量的黑巧克力。你知道我刚刚意识到什么吗？我女朋友会活到150岁，因为她吃的都是90%或80%的黑巧克力。她整天喝绿茶。她整天喝姜和肉桂饮料。她吃的是**彩虹般的食物**（Full Rainbow: 指摄入多种颜色丰富的蔬果）。她应该代替你来做节目。我知道。我完全知道。没错。不，可可。说真的，对大脑健康和心血管健康都有益。他们只是做研究，给志愿者（通常是学生，也就是年轻人）服用可可，他们能够显示在食用可可几分钟内，肯定在一小时内，血流量就发生了变化。对你的血流量有益的变化。他们称之为**心脏药物**。是的。不，心脏循环，大脑。

Okay, Coco. Yeah, chocolate, dark chocolate is a medicine. End of one of the best medicines around is 50 g or 100 g of 75% or more dark chocolate. Do you know what I've just realized? My girlfriend, she's going to live till she's 150 because she all she eats 90% or something 80% dark chocolate. She drinks green tea all day. She has the ginger and cinnamon drinks all day. She eats the the full rainbow. She should be stepping in for you. I know. I I know. Exactly. No, Coco. Seriously, brain health as well, cardiovascular health. I mean, they just they do studies where they've put coco into volunteers. That means students usually um you know so young kids and they were able to show changes in the blood flow within minutes certainly within an hour of eating cocoa beneficial changes in your blood flow. They call it the heart medicine. Yeah. No heart circulation brain.

### 可可的提神作用与选择

所以，我女朋友非常注重精神层面。她经营一家名为**Bali Breathwork**（Bali Breathwork: 一家呼吸法业务）的公司。如果我必须说的话，这算是个广告。但在她的公司里，她做的其中一件事是，在与来自世界各地的女性进行静修会话开始时，她会为她们制作**可可**。你会立刻注意到人们喝了一杯热可可后是如何改变的。她说这几乎能“打开她们的心扉”。我想那是因为血液循环的原因。是的，确实如此。但我们也知道它还含有其他一些有益的兴奋作用，有点类似于咖啡的效果，咖啡当然也是一种药物。但可可和巧克力确实有提神作用，这就是我们喜欢它的原因。我们必须明确，我们说的不是那种袋装的热巧克力。我们希望它的可可含量尽可能高。糖越少，脂肪越少越好。所以我们说的是75%或更高可可固形物的黑巧克力，它的味道会更像药，没那么甜。但我告诉我的许多病人，每天吃50克。它是一种药物。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So she's um my girlfriend's very spiritual. She runs a business called Bali Breathwork. Um #ad if I have to say that. But in her business, one of the things she does at the very start of the session with women all over the world that come to her retreats is she makes cacao for them. And you notice instantly how people change when they've had a hot cup of cacao. It's and and she says it like almost brings out their heart. And I guess that's because of the circulation reasons. Yes, it is. But it also of course we know it contains a few other beneficial stimulate stimulating effects sort of similar to the effects with coffee which in certainly as I've already said is a medicine as well. Uh but cocoa and chocolate does have a uplifting effect which is why we love it. So and we have to be clear here we're not talking about hot chocolate that comes from a packet or something necessarily. We would like it to be as dark as possible. Okay. Sorry, the less sugar, the less fat. Um, so we talk about 75% cocoa solids, you know, so it's dark chocolate and it tastes a bit more medicinal, doesn't it? It's not as sweet. Um, but I'm saying to many of my patients, take 50 g a day. It's a medicine.

### 绿茶的认知益处与连接的重要性

天哪，她是对的。我的冰箱里全是黑巧克力。我倾向于避免它，但我冰箱的抽屉里都是她的黑巧克力，她喜欢90%的。如果她能买到90%的，她就会买。是的。90%现在相当不错了。是的。是的。看看绿茶。2008年的一项研究支持了它如何改善认知功能、记忆力、注意力准确性，根据2011年《**营养生物化学杂志**》（Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry）的报道，长期饮用与较低的认知衰退和阿尔茨海默病风险相关。很高兴有人能重复你所说的。是的，但它确实如此。我没有意识到这一点。我完全不知道。那些她给我时我拒绝的次数。你不能说抱歉。我真的，真的，我得到了一个哇。心脏健康、大脑功能、脂肪燃烧和新陈代谢、癌症预防（早期证据）、血糖和胰岛素敏感性、肠道和口腔健康。

Damn, she's right. My fridge is full of dark chocolate. I tend to avoid it, but the drawer of my fridge has all of her dark chocolate in, and it's she she likes it 90%. If she can get a 90% she'll take it. Yeah. 90% is quite good now. Yeah. Yeah. Having a look at the green tea. There was a study done in 2008 which supports how it improved cognitive function, memory, attention accuracy and um long-term consumption associated with lower risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease according to the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry in 2011. It's nice to have somebody else just say what you said. Yeah, but it's it's ex exactly. I didn't realize that. I didn't I had no idea. I had no idea. All those times I turned it down when she offered it to me. You can't say sorry. I have literally literally I've got a Wow. heart health, brain function, fat burning and metabolism, cancer prevention, early evidence, blood sugar and insulin sensitivity, gut and oral health.
