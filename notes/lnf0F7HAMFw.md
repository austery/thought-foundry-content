title: AMD财报深度解析：在市场抛售与加密货币崩盘中的关键考验
---

### 市场概览：加密货币崩盘引发的抛售潮

好了，大家好。欢迎回到频道。我们现在进入市场收盘时刻。今天是一个非常特别的财报日。SMCI、Tempest、Arista、Rivian、Zeta、Axon、Pinterest，当然还有那家公司——当它股价远低于100美元时，这两位分析师就一直在分析它。他们当时就说：“嘿，我认为这值得买入。”而听了他们话的人肯定从中赚了些钱。AMD，Neil、Jose，你们好吗？

<p class="english-text">All right, hello everybody. Welcome back to the channel. We are here on the market close. We got a very special day of earnings. SMCI, Tempest, Arista, Rivian, Zeta, Axon, Pinterest, and none other than the company that both of these guys have been analyzing since it was well below $100. And they've been saying, "Hey, I think it's a buy." And the people that listen to them definitely made some money off that. AMD, Neil, Jose, what's up?</p>
</details>

>> 你好，你好。一切都好。只要我们不看市场，我想一切都很好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Hello. Hello. All good. All good. As long as we don't look at the market, I think everything's fine.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，我还没打开我的投资组合，所以我现在还是一脸笑容，但我很确定，当我们听到现在市场的情况时，这张笑脸很快就会消失。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I haven't opened up the portfolio yet, so I still have a happy face, but I'm pretty sure we're about to change that really quickly as we hear what's going on with the market right now.</p>
</details>

>> 今天市场确实很难看，AMD不得不在这样的一天发布财报，这很糟糕，但无论如何，情况确实不容乐观。标普500指数今天下跌了1%。盘中曾有过一点反弹，出现了一个小小的V形回升，但随后又跌了回去。AMD下跌了约3%。股价一度达到257美元，最低跌至247美元，现在处于250美元区间。你知道，现在发生的部分原因是加密货币市场的清算。我不知道具体发生了什么，但加密货币市场已经蒸发了2500亿美元。比特币跌破了10万美元，一直在99500美元附近徘徊。现在是100700美元。以太坊跌破了3200美元，现在就在3200美元下方。但显然，所有与加密货币相关的衍生品股票，比如Bitmain、MicroStrategy、Coinbase、Robin Hood，今天也都受到了冲击。所以这显然是一次难看的抛售。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> It is definitely a ugly market today and it sucks that AMD has to be reporting on a day like this, but nonetheless, it is pretty ugly. S&P 500 down 1% on the day. There was a bit of recovery in the middle of the day, a little bit of a V-shape, then it kind of went right back down. AMD right there down about 3%. It got to 257. Low was at 247 and now it is in that 250 range. And you know, part of what's happening right here is a liquidation of the crypto markets. I don't know what exactly is going on, but 250 billion has been wiped out from the crypto markets. Bitcoin got below 100,000. It's been bouncing off 99.5. It's at 100.7 right now. Ethereum got below 3200. Right now it's just below 3200. But obviously all the crypto derivative names like a bit mine, Micro Strategy, Coinbase, Robin Hood, all those have been getting hit on the day as well. So obviously an ugly sell-off.</p>
</details>

我认为不能说这必然是一次恐慌性抛售，因为**VIX**（Volatility Index: 衡量市场恐慌情绪的波动率指数）并没有飙升。VIX确实有很大的波动，但并不是那种让你觉得“好了，这是恐慌顶峰”的大规模波动，因此我们可以认为这事过去了。尽管如此，“恐惧与贪婪指数”显示我们正处于极度恐惧状态，这表明恐慌已经达到顶峰，但鉴于这次下跌不像以往那么迅速，可能会有更持久的影响。那么，在我们讨论AMD之前，Neil，我先问你。对于我们今天看到的情况，你有什么简短的宏观看法吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think one could say this is necessarily a panic sell because the VIX is not spiking. You have a big move on the VIX, but it's not some massive move where you would say, okay, it's peak fear and therefore we can kind of move on from it. Nonetheless, the fear and greed index is signaling that it is peak fear because we're at extreme fear, but there might be something potentially more prolonged given it's not as rapid as previous decline. So, real quick before we get into AMD, Neil, I'll ask you first. Any just quick macro thoughts about what we're seeing today?</p>
</details>

>> 不，我想我不知道加密货币那件事。我记得上次我们看到这种情况是什么时候？是周五，对吧？一个崩盘的周五清算事件。可能是全面的追加保证金通知。但今天，我想政府关门再次延长可能在当前的市场情绪中扮演了角色。再加上上周鲍威尔的言论也确实没帮上忙，他说12月降息并非板上钉钉等等。政府关门的延长意味着我们不会从美国获得太多宏观数据。这也没有帮助。然后出于某种奇怪的原因，即使在所有大银行、大科技公司都报告了相当不错的业绩之后，人们仍然对现在发生的事情持怀疑态度。所以，情况就是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> No, I guess I mean I didn't know about the crypto the crypto thing. I guess the last time we saw that was uh what was it? A Friday, right? A crash Friday liquidation event. Margin cold probably across the board. Um but today I guess maybe the government shutdown being again extended might play a role is probably playing a role in this in this sentiment right now. Um plus Jean Pow last week didn't really help with his comments right when he said that the December cut is not a given etc etc. Uh the government shutdown being extended means that we're not really going to get a lot of uh macro data from from the US. So that doesn't help either. And then for some strange reason, even after all the big banks, big tech companies reported quite good reports, for some strange reason, people are still skeptical about what's going on right now. So, I mean, it is what it is. It is what it is.</p>
</details>

>> Jose，对加密货币市场的红色有什么看法吗？

>> 红色，没什么特别的。只是在今天我们看到的一些高增长的AI基础设施需求方面，我想说我今天稍微试了下水。没什么太疯狂的，但我抓住了一些机会，投资了像CoreWeave和Nebu这样的公司。所以，长期来看，我仍然对AI基础设施领域非常兴奋和看好。短期内的波动性，我忘了那句名言，是我们为在股市中享受这趟美妙旅程所付出的代价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Jose, any thoughts on this red on the crypto market? Red, not really. Um, just in some of the high growth AI infrastructure needs that we did see today, I would I would say I did get my toes a little wet today. uh nothing too crazy but I I took a bit of an opportunity uh in certain players like Cororeweave and Nebu. So uh long-term still super excited bullish long-term trend for the AI infrastructure space. Uh shortterm the volatility is uh I forget the quote the fee we pay for for this great ride here in the stock market.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。你看，我的看法是，我们经历了一个不可思议的十月。人们忘了我们在十月份上涨了2.5%。这是一个巨大的涨幅。2025年连续六个月都是上涨的。所以，可能会有一些获利回吐，出现一些抛售。你可能会有一些**CTA**（Commodity Trading Advisor: 商品交易顾问，通常指遵循趋势的量化基金）在过去几个月达到最大多头头寸后开始平仓。所以，我认为没有任何一个全国性的头条新闻可以解释这一切，除了今天有选举这个事实。也许这导致了一些波动，但这不像特朗普发了关于大豆的推文然后市场就抛售。所以这真的可能只是那种你必须捏着鼻子逢低买入，然后继续前进的日子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And look I mean my take on this is we had an incredible October. People forget we were up two and a half% in October. That's a massive move. six month six month in a row in 2025 of being green and so potentially consolidating some of those gains getting a bit of a sell-off. You might have some CTAs uh also unloading if they went max long over the past couple months. So I mean I don't think there's a a national headline that anyone can point to outside of the fact that we do have elections today. Maybe that's causing some of the volatility but it's not like Trump tweeted about soybeans and the market selling off. So this really might be just one of those days where you have to uh hold your nose by the dip and kind of keep it going from there.</p>
</details>

### AMD 财报前瞻：OpenAI 合作是关键

我们来谈谈AMD吧。AMD的财报将在4:15公布，各位。所以我们还有大约25分钟。市场一收盘，我就会过一遍所有其他公司的财报，因为我们还有很多其他公司。我会在聊天区为AMD发起一个“涨还是跌”的投票。华尔街期望的**EPS**（Earnings Per Share: 每股收益）是1.17美元，营收87.5亿美元。Neil，我从你开始。我认为这只股票从150美元涨到250美元，客观上是因为与OpenAI的合作。你认为今天Lisa Su需要谈论什么才能继续维持这个估值倍数？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um AMD, let's get into it. AMD will be out at 4:15, guys. So, we have about 25 minutes. As soon as the market closes, I will get through all the other earnings because we got a lot of other companies and I'll put a pump or dump poll for AMD in the chat. Street wants a $1.17 of EPS, revenue of 8.75 billion. Neil, I'll get started with you. Uh, the reason this stock moved from 150 to 250, I think objectively is this OpenAI partnership. What do you think Lisa Sue needs to talk about today in order to continue having that multiple?</p>
</details>

>> 是的。当然，股价的大幅上涨，我想你可以在图表上看到，是在那次巨大的OpenAI与AMD的交易之后。我知道很多人都有疑问，包括我自己，他们从哪里搞到钱的。我不会问这个问题，因为也许Sam会生气然后告诉我，如果你不想要你的股份，你可以卖掉它们。我会给你找个买家。好吧，Sam，你开玩笑吧。我没有任何股份可以卖。所以就这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. So the of course the big jump I think you can see this on the on the chart is of course after that huge open AAI AMD deal which again I know a lot of people have questions myself included where do they get the money from. I'm not going to ask that question cuz maybe Sam will get angry and tell me if you don't want your shares you can sell them. I will find you a buyer. Well jokes on you Sam. I don't have any shares to sell. So there you go.</p>
</details>

>> 你让他无话可说了，Neil。你让他无话可说了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> You showed him Neil. you showed him.</p>
</details>

>> 但是，是的，我想听到的是——我今天早上和Jose谈过了——我想听到的是一个实际的AI收入指引。因为他们总是说，“哦，我们看到了一些增长等等。我们预计这项业务将为我们创造数百亿美元的收入。”我想，好吧，很酷，但我们已经进入第三季度了，所以你不妨告诉我们你对全年的预期。我们知道巨大的影响将在2026年及以后出现，但我希望，也许能有一个今年的指引数字，然后或许能提供一些关于他们明年为OpenAI和Oracle能多快地提升MI450系列产量的说明，因为Oracle也是他们的大客户。我确实认为其他方面，比如客户端、游戏和嵌入式业务，都会表现得相当不错。所以我预计这个季度会非常非常轻松地超出预期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> But yeah, I mean what I want to hear is I I I spoke with Jose this morning. What I want to hear is an actual AI revenue guidance because it has always been oh we we are seeing some growth etc etc. We expect this business to be generating tens of billions of dollars for us. I'm like okay cool but I mean we are already in Q3 so you might as well tell us what you are expecting for the full year. We know that the big impact is going to be 2026 and onwards, but I'd like I'd like maybe a number for for guidance for this year and then maybe maybe some color on how fast they can ramp up the MI450 series uh next year for OpenAI also for Oracle as well because Oracle is also a big a big client of theirs. Um I do think that the other side right client side gaming and embedded are all going to do quite well. So I'm expecting a very very easy beat for this quarter.</p>
</details>

>> 好的，Jose，你有什么期待？你认为指引需要大幅提高才能让这个OpenAI的潜在收入显得合理吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Okay, Jose, what are you expecting getting us? And do do you think do you think guidance has to go a lot higher to kind of make sense of this OpenAI potential revenue?</p>
</details>

>> 我是说，理论上是这样，但我们必须记住，MI450，也就是合同的主要来源，预计要到2026年下半年才会发布。所以理论上，这不应该真正影响到下一季度的指引。现在，我今天早些时候和Neil聊过，我说每个季度都有一个关键问题。当DeepSeek事件发生时，所有问题都围绕着DeepSeek领域。然后我们又遇到了关于微软在数据中心业务放缓的问题。这个问题被问到了所有主要参与者，所有芯片公司。我认为这次财报季，对于像AMD、Broadcom、Marvell、Nvidia这样尚未报告业绩的半导体公司来说，问题将是OpenAI将如何支付。这是他们都会关注的问题。而且我不认为他们中的任何一个会有正确的答案。所以，我不知道市场是否会喜欢这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I I mean in theory it does, but we have to remember that the MI450, which is a lot of what the contract is coming from, the OpenAI is not expected to be released until 2026, in the second half of 2026. So in theory shouldn't really impact like guidance for next quarter. Now I I I talked with Neo earlier today and I was like every quarter there's a question that's the question to ask this quarter. When the deepseek moment happened it was all about the deepseek space. Then we kind of had that question about Microsoft slowing down in data center. Um and and that was the question asked on all major players on all chip companies. I think the question for these earnings for semiconductor companies that still haven't reported like AMD, like Broadcom, like Marvel, like Nvidia is going to be how is Open AI going to pay it. That's the question that they're all going to be focusing on. And I don't think any of them are going to have a right answer. So, I don't know if the market is going to like that.</p>
</details>

不过，总的来说，短期内，所以我长期非常看好这只股票。我相信与OpenAI的交易，与Oracle的大宗交易，是让这家公司成为万亿美元公司的机会，虽然不是保证。但在短期内，我们确实从台积电和英特尔的财报中得到了一些很好的信息。台积电继续看到AI加速器和高性能计算领域的强劲需求，这通常包括AMD涉足的消费级GPU和CPU。其次，英特尔也报告说他们在服务器端和消费端都面临供应限制。而英特尔目前整体上正在失去市场份额，却还供应受限。我无法想象作为技术领导者的AMD正在经历什么样的增长。所以，短期内我很兴奋。问题是这种兴奋有多少已经被计入股价，但长期来看，我非常非常看好这家公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Overall though, in the short term, so long term, I'm very bullish on the stock. I believe the OpenAI deal, the Oracle massive deal is a opportunity for this to be a trillion dollar company, not a guaranteed. Um, but in the short term, we did get some great insight from TSMC and Intel that reported earnings. TSMC continues to see strong demand in AI accelerators and kind of the high performance computing which typically involves consumer GPUs and CPUs which uh AMD plays in. The second thing, Intel also reported that they were supply constraint in both the server side and the consumer side. And Intel is one that's losing market share overall right now and their supply constraint. I can't imagine what's happening with AMD who is right now the tech leader. Um, what type of growth they're seeing. So, um, shortterm I'm excited. The question is how much of that excitement has been priced in, but long term very, very bullish on the company.</p>
</details>

>> 你认为很多已经被计入股价了吗？

>> 我认为是的。股票市值从3000亿美元跃升至近5000亿美元。我想我们现在接近4000多亿？我认为很多已经被计入了。我希望Lisa能采取比她通常更激进一些的做法。如果不是这样，短期可能会很疯狂，但我认为长期的机会仍然存在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Do you think a lot of it has been priced in? I mean the stock jumped from 300 billion market cap to nearly 500 billion. I I I think what are we close to 400 and something? Um I think a lot has been priced in and I hope Lisa uh does take a little bit more aggressive approach than she usually does. Um if not short term could be crazy but I think the long term the opportunity is still there.</p>
</details>

>> 我觉得这很公平。我同意。我认为她需要一个像拉里·埃里森那样的季度，而那种季度意味着增加剩余履约义务，因为正如你所说，收入要到最早2026年第三季度才能确认。所以，如果你今天不能给华尔街一个收入数字，你可以给他们一个收入预期。而华尔街对那些能够展示AMD收入最终会到来的预期的公司给予了重奖。亚马逊昨天在他们的交易中也得到了这个。所以Neil，我想你也会认为指引必须强劲，因为如果他们没有那个指引，而是给出了14%的增长——根据台积电的财报和Jose的说法，我认为不会是像上个季度那样的14%——那么这只股票的表现可能不会太好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think that's fair. I agree. I think she needs a Larry Ellison type of quarter and that Larry Ellison type of quarter would mean to increase remaining performance obligations because as you said the revenue can't be collected until latest Q3 2026 or sorry earliest Q3. So it's like if you can't give the street a number of revenue today you can give them the expectation of revenue and the street has heavily rewarded companies that have been able to show the expectation of this AMD revenue eventually coming. That's what Amazon got yesterday in their deal as well. So Neil, I would imagine you think that guide it just has to be strong because if they don't have that guide and they come up with 14% growth, which I don't think it will be 14% like it was last quarter based on TSM earnings as as Jose said, then the stock's probably not going to do the best.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。再加上，来自中国业务不再存在的最大冲击已经过去了。那件事的最大影响已经过去了。但是，是的，指引很重要。我再次认为我们不应该关注像甲骨文的**RPO**（Remaining Performance Obligations: 剩余履约义务，代表未来可确认的合同收入）这样的东西，RPO不是合同锁定的担保收入，所以那个巨大的数字也可能永远不会实现，这还有待观察，是一个很大的问号。但对于AMD，是的，指引需要一个实际的数字，因为他们给出的指引一直没有具体数字，比如“哦，我们预计会实现两位数增长”，是高两位数还是强劲两位数？我和Jose试图解读这个，这可能从20%一直到90%。这都是强劲和高两位数。我们不知道那是什么。就像“哦，数百亿美元”。我想，好吧，但是对于一个财年来说，那是100亿、120亿、150亿还是160亿？也许给我们一个数字，特别是今年的，因为你们已经接近财年年底了。所以对他们来说预测可能会更容易些。但是，他们喜欢保守行事。但是，是的，当你，再次，以溢价交易不是他们的错，但对于投资者来说，是的，当你以溢价交易时，你希望管理层能更清晰或更激进一些，这么说吧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Plus the biggest hit from that China non-existing business anymore is behind us. The biggest hit for that uh is behind us. But yeah, guidance is important. Again I don't think we should be focusing on on what like an Oracle's RPO again the RPO are not contracted secured revenue so that huge number might also never happen I mean remains to be seen that's that's a big uh question mark but with AMD yeah guidance actual number for guy because guidance has been given without an actual number like okay we expect to grow double what is it high double digit or strong double digit I mean me and Jose were trying to decrypt this this thing this can go from 20% all the way to 90%. That's strong and high double digits. We don't know what that is. It's like the oh tens of billions of dollars. I'm like, okay, but for a fiscal year, is that $10 billion, 12, 15, 16? Maybe give us a number, especially for this year because you're already towards the end of the of their fiscal year. So, might be easier for them to project something. But, uh, they like to play it safe. But yeah, when you are, again, it's not their fault that they're trading at a premium, but for investors, yes, when you are trading at at a premium, you would like the management to actually be maybe a bit clearer or a bit more aggressive, let's say.</p>
</details>

同意。这是个公平的观点。我们确实看到AMD的看跌期权有大量的期权金流入。242美元行权价，有250万美元的价外看跌期权。我的意思是，在这一点上，当市场下跌时，你显然会看到很多交易员和对冲他们AMD多头头寸的人买入大量看跌期权来保护自己。那么，隐含波动率，有人知道吗？我想大概是8.4%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Agree. That's a fair point. We do have a lot of option premium coming in on puts on AMD as well. 242 strike, 2.5 million in OTM puts. I mean, at this point, when the market's dumping, you're obviously going to go get a lot of traders and people that are hedging their long AMD positions with a bunch of puts to protect to protect themselves. So, the implied move, does anyone know the implied? I think it's about 8.4%.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，我们今天早上查了，8.4%，8.3%。所以，它可以，Jose，我想它可以一直到，是的，230和271，基于现在的价格。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, we did. We checked this morning 8.4 8.3. So, it can Jose um I think it goes all the way. Yeah, 230 and 271 based on the price of right now.</p>
</details>

好的，就这样。230或271。我们会密切关注。离市场收盘还有三分钟。我们还有很多其他的宏观头条，我们会在财报后讨论。我今天看到的一件事，与劳动力市场的论点相符，据彭博社报道，美国航空公司将裁减数百个公司职位。所以，再次，很多这样的裁员都发生在白领领域，也就是一些人可能认为更官僚的中层管理职位。这可能也是因为人工智能。我不知道美国航空公司的确切原因，但我们确实看到了更多这样的趋势。这也可能是我们看到一些抛售的原因之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, there you go. 230 or 271. We will keep an eye on it. We got three minutes until this market closes. We got a bunch of other macro headlines that we'll talk about after the earnings. Uh, one thing that I did see today going in line with this argument about the labor market, American Airlines will be cutting hundreds of corporate jobs as per Bloomberg that was announced today. So again, a lot of these jobs are happening in the uh white collar space, aka middle management jobs that some people may argue are typically more bureaucratic. Um, and potentially that's happening because of AI. I don't know the exact reason from American Airlines, but we are seeing a bit more of a trend on this. That might also be a reason why we're seeing a little bit of a sell-off,</p>
</details>

但坦白说，就像Neil说的，我们没有数据。我们本应在今天早上得到JOLTS数据。但我们没有，因为政府关门而延迟了。今天有几位参议员出来说，政府关门可能在本周末得到解决。但我的意思是，市场对关门的忽视是有限度的。到某个时候，它开始产生实际影响，并开始产生心理影响，比如“嘿，劳动力市场怎么样了？”“嗯，我们不知道。”“好吧，如果我们不知道，我们该如何配置我们的资本？”希望这能在年底前，或者至少在本周末前得到解决，以便我们能更好地了解情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but quite frankly, as as as uh Neil said, we don't have data. So we were supposed to get jolts this morning. We don't have that data. It's delayed because the government shut down. You had a couple senators coming out today saying that government shutdown maybe will be resolved by the end of the week. But I mean the market can only ignore the shutdown for so long. At some point it starts having a tangible effect and it starts having a psychological effect of like hey how is the labor market doing? Well we don't know. It's like okay well how are we supposed to allocate our capital if we don't know and hopefully that gets resolved by the end of the year or at least the end of the week to get a better understanding of it.</p>
</details>

AMD 250，收盘前下跌。我们还有两分钟。Neil和Jose，涨还是跌？你们猜什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">AMD 250 dumping into the close. Uh, we got two minutes left. Neil and Jose, pump or dump? What would you guess?</p>
</details>

>> 我猜我们会到230。我会选到230。所以，我们下跌了。我们会下跌8%。好吧，Jose，你现在必须站在另一边了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I'd go with we go to 230. I'd go we go to 230. So, we're down. We're going down the 8%. Well, Jose, you have to take the other side now.</p>

>> 是的，我正想说我恨死Neil了。所以，我会选择相反的一边。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I was going to say I hate Neil with my whole life. So, um, I'm going to go with the opposite side.</p>

>> 不，不，不。你们俩都可以选跌，然后我选涨，成为对抗你们两个AMD多头的群众宠儿。老实说，我其实更喜欢这个剧本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> No, no, no. You both can go dump and then I'll go pump and be the crowd favorite against the two AMD bulls. I actually like that scenario way better to be honest.</p>

>> 对我来说可以。对我来说可以。如果它涨了，我赚钱。如果它跌了，我是对的。所以，

<p class="english-text">>> Works for me. Works for me. If it goes up, I make money. If it goes down, I'm right. So,</p>

</details>

我们拭目以待。我们今天就会知道结果。所以，感谢大家来到这里。离AMD财报还有15分钟。在此之前我们还有很多公司。我会把所有数据都过一遍，让大家看到我们的即时反应，然后一旦AMD财报出来，我们就会深入讨论，并且我相信我们会在东部时间下午5点收听电话会议。所以如果你想留下来听电话会议，我们今天也会收听。

>> 哦天哪。好吧，那比摇铃还费劲。好了，AMD今天下跌3.7%。标普下跌1.16%。英伟达下跌3.8%。英伟达市值蒸发了约1500亿美元。特斯拉下跌5%。顺便说一句，今天特斯拉社区的投资者之间有很多争议。一些非常有影响力的投资者说他们要离开嘉信理财（Schwab），因为嘉信理财投票反对董事会给埃隆的薪酬方案。甚至Robinhood的CEO Vlad今天也评论说，他们可能会给转户到Robinhood的特斯拉投资者一些奖励。

<p class="english-text">>> Oh goodness. Okay, that that's even more effort than the bell. All right, AMD down 3.7% on the day. S&P down 1.16. Nvidia down 3.8. Nvidia lost about 150 billion in market cap. Tesla down 5%. By the way, lots of controversy today around investors in the Tesla community. Some very influential investors saying they're going to leave Schwab because of how Schwab is acting, voting against the board for Elon's pay package. Even Vlad, the Robinet CEO, commented today saying that we might give Tesla investors a match for coming over to Robinet.</p>

<p class="english-text">>> The genius marketing move.</p>
</details>

>> 绝对是天才之举。但这显示了需求可能有多大。如果Robinhood真的给出2%或3%的奖励，让人们离开嘉信理财，只为了把他们的特斯拉股票转过来。我的意思是，这对Robinhood来说可能是一笔大买卖，对特斯拉投资者来说显然也很好，如果他们不想留在一个投票反对董事会的机构。特斯拉今天下跌了约5%。Robinhood下跌7%。Palantir在经历了我有史以来见过的上市公司最好的季度之一后，今天下跌了8%。Grab在今天收盘前有所回升。它曾跌至5.36美元，现在是5.80美元，但仍然下跌了4.5%。谷歌下跌2%。所以下跌4%，AMD下跌4%，Reddit下跌8%，亚马逊下跌2%，Meta下跌2%，Salesforce下跌3%，PayPal下跌3%，ELF下跌2%，SMCI下跌6%，以太坊下跌11%，然后比特币今天下跌5.8%。Applovin下跌3%，Circle下跌5%。我的意思是，无论你走到哪里，几乎都是一片血洗，这只是每个人都必须面对的日子之一。这是今天收盘时的热力图。医疗保健是绿色的，金融是绿色的，消费防御是绿色的。科技、软件、半导体等其他所有板块几乎都是红色的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Absolutely genius move. But it goes to show how much demand there might be. And if Robinet does give two or 3% to leave Schwab to just bring over your Tesla shares. I mean, that could be a really big deal for Robin Hood and obviously very good for Tesla investors if they don't want to stay with an organization voting against the board. Tesla right there down about 5% today. Robin Hood down 7%. Palant here after one of the best quarters I've ever seen from a stock market company in in history as a public market company down 8% on the day. Grab right here did get a little recovery towards the end of the day. It was at 536 now at 580 but still down four and a half%. Google down 2%. So down 4%, AMD down 4%, Reddit down 8%, Amazon down 2%, Meta down 2%, Salesforce down three, PayPal down three, ELF down two, SMCI down six, Ethereum down 11, and then Bitcoin down 5.8% on the day. Apploven down three, Circle down five. I mean, it was a blood bath pretty much everywhere you went and it was just one of those days that everyone had to deal with. Here was the heat map to end out the day. Healthcare was green, financials were green, consumer defenses were green. Pretty much everything else in tech, uh, software semis, etc. Those were red on the day.</p>
</details>

好了，财报。我们开始吧。我们有很多不同的公司。SMCI、Rivian、Cava、Zeta、Upstart、Pinterest、AET、Axon、Tempest、Toast、Kratos。我会尽快找到这些数字。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, earnings. Let's get into it. So, we got a lot of different companies. Uh, SMCI, Rivian, Cava, Zeta, Upstar, Pinterest, AET, Axon, Tempest, Toast, Kratos. I will be looking for the numbers as soon as we can get them.</p>
</details>

>> 我想Astera Labs是另一个今天公布财报的热门公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Ster Labs, I think, is another popular one does reporting today.</p>
</details>

>> 是ALAB，对吧？好的，让我把它调出来。是的，ALAB。然后我们开始。让我们看看有没有任何数字出来了。再次提醒，AMD将在大约15分钟后公布。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> That is ALAB, right? Okay, let me pull that up. Yep, ALAB. And then we'll get into it. So, let's see if we get any numbers that are coming out yet. Again, AMD is going to be in about 15 minutes.</p>
</details>

>> 我想Tempest可能出来了。也许。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Think Tempest is maybe out. Maybe.</p>
</details>

>> 好的。是的。Tempest。给你。每股收益超出预期40%。华尔街认为他们会亏损18美分，结果他们亏损了11美分。营收3.34亿美元，预期为3.28亿美元。营收同比增长85%。每股收益增长56%。Tempest盘后交易相对平稳，没什么动静。但你再次看到，公司们在顶线和底线上持续表现。Axon，他们的每股收益未达预期24%。1.17美元对1.54美元，营收7.1亿美元对7.04亿美元。所以他们营收超预期，但每股收益未达预期。Axon盘后看起来在下跌。Axon，哇，下跌了7.9%。是的，Axon受到了重创。每股收益大幅未达预期。这只股票今年涨了很多。这往往会带来一些痛苦。所以，Axon下跌了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Okay. Yep. Tempest. Here you go. Beat by 40% on EPS. Street thought they would lose 18 cents. They ended up losing 11 cents. uh 334 versus 328 million. Revenue is up 85% year-over-year. EPS is up 56%. Tempest after hours relatively flat, not really making a move. But again, you are seeing companies continue to be on the top of the bottom line. Axon, they missed by 24% on EPS. 117 versus 154, 710 million versus 704. So they beat by revenue, missed on EPS. Axon looks like it's heading down after hours. Axon is wow down 7.9%. Yeah, Axon's getting hit. Axon is getting hit. Missed by EPS by a wide margin. The stock was up a lot this year. That tends to create some pain. So, Axon, that's down.</p>
</details>

SMCI出来了吗？SMCI我还没拿到。我们有Amgen，他们的每股收益超出预期13%，营收超出预期7%。对他们来说还不错。我想最近也有个政客买了这只股票。Amgen盘后实际上涨了。所以那只股票在Amgen上有点动静。但是其他一些股票仍然在下跌。还没拿到AMD。SMCI也还没有。Tempest看起来下跌了。让我看看我们有没有财报。我们有财报。哦，是的。我们刚刚说了，超出预期39%。Tempest盘后下跌了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">SMCI is that out yet? SMCI don't have it yet. We have Amgen, they beat by 13% on EPS, beat by 7% on revenue. Not too bad for them. I think a politician also bought the stock recently. Amgen's actually up after hours. So, that one getting a little bit of a move right there on Amgen. Uh, but that but some of these other names are still down. Don't have AMD yet. SMCI still don't have that yet either. Tempest is down it looks like. Let me see if we have earnings. We do have earnings. Oh, yeah. We just just said it beat by 39%. Tempest after hours is down.</p>
</details>

>> 下跌了7%。是的。所以今天总共下跌了12%。所以那只股票确实受到了打击。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Is down 7%. Yep. So, down 12% for the day. So, that one is indeed getting hit.</p>
</details>

>> 好的。所以，让我们看看其他一些。所以，Tempest在顶线和底线上都超预期。下跌了7%。Axon未达预期24%，营收超预期1%。下跌了7%。Amgen在顶线和底线上都超预期。Skyworks每股收益超预期15%，营收超预期5%。所以你看到Skyworks，1.76美元对1.53美元，11亿美元对10.5亿美元。每股收益同比增长14%。营收同比增长7%。Skyworks，白天是红色的，盘后有点绿色。Skyworks盘后上涨了约0.5%。但仍然是红色的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> okay. So, let's see some of the other ones. So, Tempest beat on the top and bottom. That's down 7%. Axon missed by 24%, beat by 1% on revenue. That's down 7%. Amjen beat on the top and the bottom. Uh, Skyworks beat by 15% on EPS and beat by 5% on revenues. So, you got Skyworks right there, 176 versus 153, 1.1 versus 1.05. EPS is up 14% year-over-year. revenue is up 7% yearover-year. Skyworks, which was during the day, red getting a little bit of green after hours. Skyworks is up about half a percent. After hours, but still red.</p>
</details>

Zeta，Zeta还没出来。还在等。还没看到。AMD马上就出来了。Kratos我还没有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Zeta Zeta is not out yet. Uh, still looking for that one. Don't see it yet. AMD again is going to be in a second. Kratos I don't have yet.</p>
</details>

>> Rivian刚报告了。我不知道你是否在关注那个。是的。让我看看我能不能拿到Rivian的数据。是的。好的。Rivian，他们未达预期12%。营收超预期3%。营收同比增长78%。每股收益同比增长11%。顶线未达预期相当难看。Rivian盘后平盘，没什么动静。他们仍然没有实现GAAP盈利。我想，你知道，我想他们有毛利，但没有GAAP利润。也许那是2026年的事，但你得深入了解Rivian，看看他们是否有任何提高运营杠杆以实现盈利的迹象。Rivian盘后有点绿，但仍然相对是红色的。SMCI在动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Caribbean just reported. I don't know if you're covering that one. Yes. Let me see if I can get Rivian's numbers. Yep. Okay. Rivian, they missed by 12%. Beat by 3% on revenue. Uh revenue is up 78% year-over-year. EPS is up 11% year-over-year. That's a pretty ugly miss on the top line. Rivian's flat after hours, not really making a move. They are still not gap profitable. I think, you know, I think the gross profits I think they have, not gap profits. Maybe that's a 2026 thing, but you got to look under the hood for Rivian to see if they do have any level of increased operating leverage for profitability. Rivian going a little green after hours, but still relatively red. SMCI is moving.</p>
</details>

>> Zeta也在上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Zeta is moving on the way up as well.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，Zeta正在变绿。Zeta真的变绿了。好的，Zeta上涨了7%，触及18美元。SMCI。我想我们也有结果了。哦，天哪。难看。SMCI每股收益未达预期10%，营收未达预期13%。是的。SMCI正在暴跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, Zeta is going green. Zeta's going real green. Okay, Zeta uh 7% move on Zeta to the upside touching 18. SMCI. I also think we have the results. Uh, super Whoa, boy. Ugly. SMCI missed by 10% on EPS, missed by 13% on revenue. Yep. SMCI is tanking.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，但这不就像他们两周前给我们的初步结果吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, but wasn't that like the the preliminary results that they gave us two two weeks ago or something?</p>
</details>

>> 哪个分析师在他们给出数字后没有正确预测？他们应该把那些家伙解雇了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> What analyst didn't project correctly after they gave us the number? They should get those guys fired.</p>
</details>

>> 不，你说得对。每个人都知道这些数字。SMCI直截了当地说了。所以股票仍然因此下跌，这简直太搞笑了。不过那是个很猛的下跌，伙计。43。下跌了8%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> No, you're right. Everyone knew these numbers. They SMCI flat out said it. So the fact that the stock is still going down on this is just hilarious. That's a nasty dump though, dude. 43. That's down 8%.</p>
</details>

>> 上次也是投资者们觉得，“啊，不，他们在骗我们。实际上是5.8，他们只是想现在骗我们。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Last time it's also the investors like ah no they're lying to us. It's really like 5.8 that they're they're just trying to trick us right now.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，这太不可思议了。上次我们到43美元是10月3日，大约一个月前。再上一次是8月5日。所以实际上，它正在回到几个月没见过的水平。但SMCI也往往反弹得很快。所以你可能会看到一些人进来逢低买入。AMD现在是249美元。离财报公布还有大约8分钟。Pinterest。哦我的天。Pinterest怎么了？哦我的天，下跌了13%。这有点难看。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, it's quite incredible. Last time we were at 43 was October 3rd, so about a month ago. And the time before that was August 5th. So realistically, it's getting back to levels that it hasn't seen in a couple months. But SMCI also tends to rebound pretty quickly. So you might have some people coming in and buying the dip. AMD right here, still 249. We got about 8 minutes until those earnings come out. Pinterest. Uh this is Oh my goodness. What is going on with Pinterest? Oh my 13% down. That's a little ugly.</p>
</details>

我还没有他们的数字。不，我有吗？是的。第四季度营收预计在13亿到13.4亿美元之间。月活跃用户6亿。我稍后会拿到顶线和底线数据，但Pinterest下跌了。Arista超出预期6%，超出预期2%。每股收益超出预期，75美分对71美分。营收23亿美元对22亿美元。Arista在动。股票代码是AET。他们在双双超预期的情况下下跌了12%。这有点难看，但尽管如此，你还是看到了一个相当难看的波动。天哪。再次，这对任何公司来说都是一个糟糕的报告日，但仍然。然后是Astera。他们超出预期26%。49美分对预期的39美分。营收2.3亿美元对2.06亿美元。Alab，那只股票上涨了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, Pinterest, I don't have their numbers yet. No. Do I? Yes. Fourth quarter revenue 1.3 to 1.34 billion on their estimates. Monthly active users 600 million. I'll get the top and the bottom line in a second, but Pinterest is down. Arista beat by 6%, beat by 2%. EPS beat 75 versus 71. Revenue 2.3 versus 2.2. Arista are removing. That's ticker symbol AET. They are down 12% on a double beat. It's a little ugly, but nonetheless, you're getting a pretty ug nasty move right there. Goodness gracious. Again, this is just a horrible day to report for any company, but still. Then you have Astera. They beat by 26%. 49 cents versus 39 cents expected. Revenue 230 versus 206. Alab, that stock is up.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，那只是绿色的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, that one's green.</p>
</details>

>> 好的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Okay.</p>
</details>

>> 非常好。所以ALAB上涨6%，Arista下跌13%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Very nice. So ALAB's up six, Arista's down 13.</p>
</details>

>> 我刚才很快地看了一下Super Micro。我的意思是，尽管他们这个季度只做了50亿美元，但他们确实给出了大约100到110亿美元的指引。我不知道市场是不是在想，“别骗我了。你们告诉我们100到110亿，但然后在财报前一周的初步结果里，你们会给我们另一个数字。”但他们确实给出了第二季度非常强劲的指引，并预计2026年将达到约360亿美元。所以，如果这些数字是真的，看起来还挺酷的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Uh I was just looking really quickly at Super Micro. I mean, even though they only did 5 billion this quarter, they did guide for about 10 to 11 billion. I wonder if the market's just like, "Don't lie to me. You're going to tell us 10 to 11 billion, but then preliminary results, you're going to give us some other number a week before earnings." But they they gave some nice strong guidance for quarter 2 and they expect about 36 billion for 2026. So, uh, if those numbers are true, it it looks pretty cool.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。而且他们的财年预期，即使季度营收发生了变化，也与分析师的预期基本保持一致。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And their fiscal year, their fiscal year stayed relatively the same for what analysts expected, even if the the quarterly revenues changed.</p>
</details>

>> 我的意思是，两个季度前，这个财年本应是400亿美元，现在是360亿。少了40亿，10%。我们就给他们这个吧。只要他们按时提交文件，应该就没问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I mean, two quarters ago, this fiscal year was supposed to be $40 billion, and now it's 36. That's a small four billion, 10% less. We'll give them that. We'll give them that. As long as they file on time, should be fine.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，你得为了适当的会计处理放弃40亿美元，我想这就是权衡。Zeta在这里表现出色。20美分对18美分。这是一个11%的超出。营收3.37亿美元对3.25亿美元。我的意思是Zeta，我对这家公司了解不多，但我知道X上的很多人都喜欢它，认为它是一个数字分析营销广告公司。它确实触及了18美元。现在股价回到了16.95美元。所以真的没有太大的波动。上涨了约1%。它之前涨得更多。但现在是平的。Upstart我想正在上涨。Upstart上涨了4%。不是很大的波动，但是有波动。我没有他们的数字。哦，不。我有的。每股收益超出预期24%。营收未达预期1%。每股收益52美分对42美分。这还不错。一点也不差。营收同比增长71%。他们未达预期1%。Upstart盘后基本持平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, you got to give up four billion for for proper accounting, I guess, is the is the trade-off. Uh Zeta right here crushed it. 20 cents versus 18 cents. That's an 11% beat. Uh revenue 337 versus 325. I mean Zeta, I don't know enough about this company, but I know a lot of people on X are fond of it as a digital analytics marketing advertising play. Uh did touch 18. Stock is now back to 1695. So really not making too much of a move. Up about 1%. It was up a bit more. Uh but that's flat. Upstart I think is making a move higher. Upstart is up4%. Not a big move, but it is a move. Uh, don't have their numbers. Oh, no. I do. Beat by 24% on EPS. Missed by 1% on revenue. 52 versus 42 on EPS. That's decent. Not bad at all. Revenues up 71% year-over-year. They missed by 1%. Upstart basically flat after hours.</p>
</details>

我们也有Pinterest的官方数据了。Pinterest。哦，那太难看了。每股收益未达预期10%。作为一家科技公司，尤其是有像Pinterest这样在广告领域有良好利润率的公司，如果你在每股收益上未达预期，你不会给投资者太多信心，尤其是在人工智能时代。10%的未达预期。38美分对42美分，10.49亿美元对10.5亿美元。营收未达预期是无关紧要的，但每股收益未达预期可能不是最好的。这就是为什么那只股票盘后下跌了约10%，不，是近15%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We also have Pinterest officially. Pinterest. Oh, that's ugly. missed by 10% on EPS. As a tech company, especially with good margins like Pinterest and the advertising space, if you're missing on EPS, you're not going to give investors a lot of confidence, especially in the age of AI. Uh 10% miss right there. 38 cents versus 42, 1.049 versus 1.05 billion. The revenue miss is inconsequential, but the EPS miss probably is not the best. That's why that stock's down about 10%, never mind almost 15% after hours for Pinterest.</p>
</details>

>> 人们现在还用Pinterest吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Do people still even use Pinterest?</p>
</details>

>> 我是说，我从来没用过，但我不认为我是它的目标用户。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I mean, I never used it, but I don't think I was the demographic for it.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，他们大约有五个人在用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, they have about five using it.</p>
</details>

>> 不。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Nope.</p>
</details>

>> 我的意思是，他们大约有5.7亿月活跃用户。他们预计第四季度将达到6亿。所以，我的意思是，有相当一部分人在使用它。理论上，它应该是最好的广告平台之一，因为当你把东西钉到你的板上时，你就有购买意图。但它还是受到了打击。Rivian在这里盘后有所回升。Rivian现在上涨了3.4%。它在白天下跌了约5%。所以很多这些在盘后有任何波动的股票，它们只是在一点点地弥补白天的跌幅。ALAB获得了一些绿色，然后我不知道为什么AET在双双超预期的情况下下跌得这么厉害。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I mean, they have about 570 million monthly activives. They're expecting 600 million in Q4. So, I mean, there are a decent chunk of people that use it. And theoretically, it should be one of the best advertising platforms out there because like you have the intent to buy when you're like pinning stuff to your board, but still that one getting hit. Rivian right here is making a bit of a recovery after hours. Uh Rivian now 3.4%. It was down during the day by about 5%. So a lot of these stocks that are getting any level of move after hours, they're they're kind of just inching away at some of the red they had during the day. ALAB getting some of the green and then I don't know why AET is down this badly on a double beat.</p>
</details>

>> 我看到聊天室里有人说Apps，我忘了那是什么股票，是Digital Turbine吗？不，那是什么股票？Apps也报告了，而且涨幅不错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I'm seeing chat um apps I forget what is that digital turbine. No, what is stock is that? Apps also report it and up a nice amount.</p>
</details>

>> 我想你说的对。Apps是Digital Turbine，它上涨了。是的。我没有他们的数据，但那只股票上涨了。我确实有Cava的数据，我还没试过，我家附近就有一家，但我就是没去过。每股收益未达预期8%，12美分对预期的13美分。然后营收2.92亿美元对2.91亿美元。营收同比增长20%。每股收益同比下降8%，这不太好看。Cava盘后基本持平，下跌约0.3%。Cava在Chipotle之后下跌了吗？我觉得它们的价格有点相似。也许Cava贵一点，但我知道Chipotle受到了重创。所以我想知道市场是不是已经预料到了什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think you're right. It's apps is a digital turbine that is up. Yes. I don't have their numbers but that stock is up. I do have the numbers for Cababa, which I still haven't tried yet. And there's one near me, but I just haven't gone there. Beat by 8% or missed by 8% on EPS, 12 cents versus 13 cents expected. And then 292 versus 291. Revenues up 20% year-over-year. EPS is down 8% year-over-year, which is not that pretty. Cava is basically flat after hours, down about.3%. Did Cava drop after Chipotle? I feel like they're kind of similar price. Maybe Cava is a little bit more expensive, but I know Chipotle took a huge hit. Um, so I wonder if the market was just already expecting something here.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，我的意思是Cava曾经一度交易到140美元。现在是50美元。所以它在过去一年里确实受到了打击，但也许没有得到与Chipotle相同的反应。让我们多关注一下Pinterest和Cava，然后我们继续。各位，AMD还有大约三分钟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I mean Cabba did Cava was turning at 140 at one point. Now it's at 50. So I mean it definitely took a hit over the past year, but maybe not getting that same Chipotle reaction. Let's get a little bit more coverage on Pinterest and Cava and then we'll keep going from there. We got AMD in about three minutes, folks.</p>
</details>

>> Pinterest的财报也出来了。该股在盘后交易中大幅下跌。该公司每股收益未达预期，为每股36美分。而预期为每股42美分。该公司营收与预期相符。Pinterest报告全球月活跃用户达到历史新高的6亿，同比增长12%。6亿的用户数高于预期。尽管如此，该股目前仍下跌14%。

>> 是的，现在略有下跌，John。Cava报告每股收益12美分，营收2.92亿美元。基本符合预期，但似乎同店销售额未达到分析师预期。他们增长了1.9%，而预期为增长2.8%。但请记住，这是与去年同期一个非常强劲的季度相比。该公司还下调了全年同店销售增长的指引，现在预测增长在3%到4%之间，而之前的范围是4%到6%。这是我们连续第二次看到指引下调。它还下调了餐厅利润率预测和调整后的EBITDA预测。我与首席财务官Trisha Tolivar交谈过，她就预测表示：“我们当然考虑到了当今行业中许多人看到的消费者压力，当我们进入第四季度时，我们看到整体需求有所下降，并希望确保……”

p class="english-text">> Yeah, just fractionally lower now, John. So, Copper reporting EPS of 12 cents on revenues of 292 million. Essentially right in line, but it seems store sales falling short of analyst estimates. They were up 1.9% versus estimates of up 2.8%. Remember though, comping against a very strong quarter this time last year. The company also cutting its guidance for full year. Same store sales growth now forecasting it to be up between 3 and 4% uh from a prior range of up four to 6%. This is the second guidance cut we've gotten in a row. Uh, it's also cutting its restaurant margin forecast and adjusted Ebonoff forecast. I did speak with CFO Trisha Tolivar who said regarding the forecast, quote, "We were certainly taking into account the consumer pressures that many are seeing in the industry today and as we moved into the fourth quarter, we saw a bit of a decline in overall demand and wanted to be sure,</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I mean, great beat on revenue there. I'm pretty excited about that. Um I see the strong guidance. Excuse me. So, I just want to see what I'm comparing it to with my numbers.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，我会读一下新闻稿，然后听听你们的看法。所以，Lisa Su说：“我们交付了一个出色的季度，营收和盈利能力创下纪录，反映了我们高性能EPYC和Ryzen处理器以及Instinct AI加速器的广泛需求。我们创纪录的第三季度业绩和强劲的第四季度指引，标志着我们增长轨迹的明显提升，因为我们不断扩大的计算业务和迅速扩展的数据中心AI业务推动了显著的营收和盈利增长。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I'll read this the press release and then we'll get your thoughts on it. So, Lisa Sue, we delivered an outstanding quarter with record revenue and profitability reflecting broad-based demand for our high performance EPYC and Ryzen processors and instinct AI accelerators. Our record third quarter performance and strong fourth quarter guidance makes a clear step up in our growth trajectory as our expanding compute franchise and a rapidly expanding data center AI business drive significant revenue and earnings growth.</p>
</details>

“我们实现了创纪录的季度营收92.2亿美元，同比增长36%，产生了自由现金流，反映了我们领先产品组合的实力和严谨的执行力。我们对AI和高性能计算的持续投资正在推动显著增长，并使AMD能够创造长期价值。”再次强调，营收同比增长36%。毛利润增长40%，利润率从50%上升到52%，净收入增长61%，从7.71亿美元增至12亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We delivered record quarterly revenue of 9.2 2 billion, up 36% year-over-year, generating free cash flow, reflecting the strength of our leadership portfolio and disciplined execution. Our continued investments in AI and high performance computing are driving significant growth and position AMD to deliver long-term value creation. Again, revenue is up 36% year-over-year. Gross profits up 40%, margins are up 2%, 50 to 52, net income is up 61%, 771 million to 1.2 billion.</p>
</details>

我稍后会公布第四季度的指引。数据中心营收从14%加速增长到22%。这还不错。我认为低于20%是人们担心的，现在高于20%，达到了22%。AMD股价目前仍然略有上涨，为252美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, Q4 guidance I'll get in a second. data center revenue accelerated from 14 to 22. That is not bad. Uh below 20 I think was the fear. It's above 20 22%. AMD stock right here still up a little bit at 252.</p>
</details>

>> 第四季度96亿美元，正负3亿美元。所以是93亿到99亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Um Q4 9.6 billion plus or minus 300 million. So 9.3 to 9.9.</p>
</details>

>> 这正是市场所预期的。他们预期的中点大约是96亿美元。总的来说，我认为短期内很棒。显然，长期的机会仍然在于MI450，就像他们提到的，那是在2026年下半年。所以，很想听到一些相关的评论，希望Lisa Su能告诉我们一些情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> That's what the market was expecting. They were expecting about 9.6 billion at at midpoint. Um, overall, I mean, I think shortterm is great. Uh, obviously the long-term opportunity is still with the MI450, um, which like they mentioned is the second half of 2026. So, would love to hear some commentary in there and hopefully Lisa Sue tells us something about it.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，我的意思是，这次财报在营收方面并不差。Jose，Neil，对这些数字有什么初步反应吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I mean, this isn't a bad earnings on the top line. Jose, uh, Neil, any raw reactions to these numbers?</p>
</details>

>> 不，到目前为止都很好。我的意思是，如果你看客户端和游戏部门，那也是40亿美元，同比增长73%。客户端占了其中的28亿美元，同比增长46%。游戏增长了181%。这是一个面临很多阻力的部门。现在，正如我们上个季度看到的，我们也从英伟达那里看到了一些顺风。而嵌入式业务似乎仍然存在一些阻力。同比增长了8%，但这是一个利润率非常非常高的业务。所以，总而言之，我们超过90亿美元并不奇怪。我想Jose和我今天早上谈到了指引。再次，这是市场预期的指引，这可能意味着他们会超出预期。可能意味着他们会再次超出预期。因为他们一直以来都相当轻松地超出预期。相当轻松。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> No, so far so good. I mean, if you look at the climb and gaming segment, that's also $4 billion, and that's up 73% year-over-year. Client is $2.8 billion out of the four. That's up 46% year-over-year. Um, gaming was up 181. That's a segment that was facing plenty of headwinds. Now, as we've seen last quarter, we've seen that also with Nvidia, some some tailwinds right there. And Embedded seems to still be a business with some headwinds. that was on 8% year-over-year, but that's one with very very high margin uh margin. So, all in all, I'm not surprised that we're above $9 billion. I think Jose myself talked about this morning for the guidance. Again, it's guidance as expected by the market, which probably means they beat it. Uh which probably means they beat it again. Um because they've been beating it quite easily. Quite easily.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。我看到的另一件事是毛利率保持在54%的水平。与去年同期持平。如果你把他们上个季度因中国业务产生的费用加回来，仍然是54%。所以这给你一些迹象，表明虽然他们在卖更多的产品，但他们并没有以更便宜的价格来获得那些收入，收入保持了他们一贯的定价。所以总的来说，在我看来，对于AMD的长期机会，我仍然非常看好。所以作为一名AMD股东，我认为到目前为止，从我们看到的情况来看，没有什么可怕的。我正想问，你看到任何危险信号吗？我想你没有，尤其是在毛利率方面，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. The other thing I'm seeing here is gross margins is staying at a 54% rate. um same place as same time last year and if you add back kind of the expense they had last quarter with the China's still 54%. So it's giving you some indication that while they're selling more they're not selling it at a like at a cheaper price to kind of get that revenue that revenue is staying them with the consistent pricing that they have. So overall still pretty bullish in my opinion for long-term opportunity for AMD. So as a AMD shareholder I I I don't think there's anything scarier so far from what we're looking at. I was just going to ask, do you see any red flags? And I don't think you do, especially with gross mortgages, right?</p>
</details>

>> 自由现金流也相当不错。本季度自由现金流为15亿美元。上个季度是11亿。去年同期仅为4.96亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> free cash flow was also quite good. Free cash flow for the quarter 1.5 billion. Last quarter was 1.1. Um same quarter last year was barely 496 million.</p>

>> 顺便说一句，现在是**13F**（Form 13F: 美国证券交易委员会要求机构投资者披露其持仓的季度报告）披露季，亚马逊已经披露了他们的13F。我们应该在未来两周内看到大部分公司的13F。他们已经卖掉了NQ和AMD。

<p class="english-text">>> By the way, it's 13F season and Amazon has disclosed their 13F. We should be getting most of them in the next two weeks. They have sold out of NQ and AMD.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，我猜他们会卖掉那个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I figured they would have sold out of that one.</p>
</details>

>> NQ和AMD，他们不再持有了。他们仍然持有Marvell、Astera、一家生物技术公司、Owlet、Rivian，显然还有Smart Trend和Vital Farms，但AMD和OQ他们已经出清了。

<p class="english-text">>> Oo NQ and AMD, they no longer hold. They still have Marll, Astera, a biotech, Owlet, Rivian, obviously Smart Trend and Vital Farms, but AMD and OQ they are out of.</p>
</details>

好的。所以，我的意思是，股票的反应是平的，这当然是意料之中的，因为在大家都预期股价会到230或270的日子里，它当然会平盘。但我认为，如果你是AMD的股东，你不会太失望，对吧？我的意思是，你很可能是在低于250美元的价格买入这只股票的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So, I mean, this is like I mean, the stock reaction is flat, which of course it's going to go flat on a day where everyone's anticipating either 230 or 270, but I think look, if you're an AMD shareholder, you can't be that upset, right? I mean, um, you're you probably bought this stock below 250 for the most.</p>
</details>

>> 我希望如此。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> I hope so.</p>

>> 我认为如果你是AMD的股东，你应该会欣喜若狂。这只股票从150美元涨到了250美元。它保持着它的估值倍数。它没有下跌。是的。也许现在不是，是的，它不是267美元。

<p class="english-text">>> It's not, you know, it's not like it's back down to 180.</p>

>> 是的。不，我的意思是，如果我们看自由现金流利润率，本季度是17%，去年同期仅为7%。所以他们在增长。自由现金流利润率在扩大。所以，是的，我很高兴。我们会看看电话会议会带来什么，因为我很确定当Lisa Su讲话或者我们的朋友Jean开始讲话时，这只股票会波动，也许通常的情况会发生，就是股票会下跌一点。但我们拭目以待。

### AMD 财报电话会议核心内容

>> 股票下跌约6%，每股收益为35美分，而预期为40美分。营收也未达预期，为50亿美元，而预期接近60亿美元。第二季度每股收益展望也低于预期，但该公司表示其订单量正在迅速扩大，其中包括130亿美元的Blackwell Ultra订单。AMD的财报也出来了，同样是AI基础设施领域，每股收益为1.20美元，略高于预期。你可以看到它略有上涨，营收为92.5亿美元，也超过了预期。这得益于好于预期的数据中心营收。同时，第四季度营收也高于市场共识。CEO Lisa Su将此归功于快速增长的数据中心业务。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Stock is down about 6% earnings at 35 cents a share compared to an estimate of 40 cents. Also a miss on revenue 5 billion versus the estimate of nearly 6 billion.

</details>

转向我们的业务部门，数据中心部门营收同比增长22%，达到创纪录的43亿美元，这得益于我们Instinct MI350系列GPU的增长和服务器市场份额的增加。服务器CPU营收创下历史新高，因为第五代Epic Turin处理器的采用迅速加速，占本季度整体Epic营收的近一半。我们上一代Epic处理器的销售在本季度也非常强劲，反映了它们在各种工作负载中的强大竞争地位。

<details>

好了，那是AMD的2025年第三季度财报电话会议。盘后股价仍然下跌，虽然没有之前那么严重，但从250美元跌至242美元。Neil，我先问你。你对那次电话会议的初步反应是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, that was AMD's Q3 2025 earnings call. Uh stock after hours still down, not as down as it was before, but 242 down from 250. Um I'll start with you Neil. What was your raw reaction to that call?</p>
</details>

嗯，不幸的是，据我所理解，我们再次没有得到那么多额外需要的信息，但话又说回来，我们只需要再等一周就能获得更多信息，因为下周有那个分析师日。我不知道他们为什么非要这样做，但好吧。你有一个财报电话会议，为什么不现在就告诉我们一些事情，然后在下周再详细阐述呢？因为在这种情况下，有些问题他们并不想真正回答。所以他们把那留到下周，好吧，我想好吧，我们再等一周。然后是一些关于数据中心服务器方面的具体问题，我的意思是，最后的来回讨论，我不知道，也许Jose，你得到了答案，但我真的没有从那整个来回问答中得到答案，我不记得那个分析师叫什么名字，但我很确定三个月前他就在试图得到同一个问题的答案，Stacy。是的，完全正确。这是我……

<p class="english-text">Well, unfortunately, I mean, from what I understood is again, we did not get that much extra needed information, but then again, we only have to wait one extra week to get a lot more information because there is that analyst day next week, which I don't know why they have to do this, but okay. Um, you have an earnings call. Why not already tell us something and then maybe expand more next week? Because in this case they there were some questions where they didn't really want to answer. So they were leaving that for next week which okay I guess fine we we'll wait we'll wait an extra week and then some specific question with regards to data center server site I mean the the back and forth there in the end I don't know maybe Jose maybe you got the answer but I did not really get an answer from from that uh from that whole back and forth question which I I can't remember what anal what's the name of the analyst but I'm pretty sure that three months ago he was trying to to get an answer on the a exact same question, Stacy. Yeah, exactly. Um, this is something I I</p>
</details>

>> 你能澄清一下吗，Neil？当他来回追问时，他究竟想弄清楚什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Can you Can you clarify, Neil? What What exactly was he trying to figure out when he went back and forth?</p>
</details>

>> 哪个业务线增长得更快，对吧？是服务器端还是……另一个是什么，服务器和数据中心？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Which which business line was growing faster, right? Is was it the server side or um was which one was the other server and uh and data center?</p>
</details>

>> 服务器。是的。不，他只是在谈论服务器CPU或Instinct数据中心GPU。所以他想知道哪个增长速度更快。然后他确实暗示了，我的意思是，他试图说出我们都想要的那个数字，65亿美元，也就是他计算出的全年所谓AI收入，这是他三个月前的计算结果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Server. Yeah. No, he was just talking about server CPU or just the instant data center GPU. So, he was trying to find out which one was growing at a faster level. And then he did indicate I mean he tried to say the number that we all want the $6.5 billion which the $6.5 billion of so-called AI revenue for the year which is what his calculated calculations told him 3 months ago</p>
</details>

>> 这非常低，非常低。因为去年那个数字超过了50亿美元，进入2025年，分析师们曾预测是121亿，120亿美元，一个季度后降到了84亿美元。现在如果他的数字显示是65亿，那真的不多，但显然根据AMD管理层的说法，那些数字是不正确的。所以希望它们不正确，因为它们会更多。但是……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> which is very low very low because last year that exceeded $5 billion going into 2025 analysts had it at I think 121 12 billion that dropped to $8.4 billion after a quarter. And now if his numbers show 6.5, uh, that's really not that much, but apparently those numbers are not correct according to AMD's management. So hopefully they're not correct because they're going to be more. But, uh,</p>
</details>

>> 你是否担心他们没有直接回答那个问题，还是你本来就没指望他们回答？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> are you are you concerned at all that they didn't really give a direct answer to that or you didn't expect them to?</p>
</details>

>> 如果下周我从分析师那里得不到任何答案，我会更担心。我会告诉你。但他们确实告诉我们，2026年他们会加速增长，而且他们没有供应问题。所以那应该很好。但再次，我认为大部分重要答案将在下周给出，不幸的是。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I'll be more concerned if next week I get zero answers from the analyst. They I'll tell you that much. But it's they did tell us that 2026 they are going to ramp ramp faster and they have no issues like no supply issues. So that should be that should be good. But again I think most of the big answers will be given next week unfortunately.</p>
</details>

>> 我认为这次电话会议我没有学到任何新东西。我认为投资逻辑仍然成立，这不一定是坏事，对吧？我认为逻辑仍然是，2026年随着MI450的推出，将是他们真正强劲的一年。尽管很多人可能讨厌Stacy，但那是个很好的问题，对吧？我不介意有人咄咄逼人地试图从AMD那里得到正确的答案。现在，我生气吗，或者我认为他们不回答是看跌信号吗？如果我不像现在这样了解AMD和Lisa Su，我可能会这么认为，但他们从来不回答那个问题。所以他们在这方面是一贯的。现在，我同意Neil的看法，我们下周会有更多更新。我希望至少能看到TAM（总目标市场）的增长，因为那是他们真正承诺的。除此之外，我不知道他们是否会给出任何关于实际GPU数量的更新。所以，再次，我认为对于长期投资者来说，我们知道的一切，我们并没有期望在450系列之前有太多增长。MI355似乎做得不错。我们预计下个季度会有不错的营收增长。我们预计2027年会有大幅增长。幸运的是，下周他们可能会给我们更多关于OpenAI交易的更新。因为看起来他们确实给出了那些信息。所以，不幸的是，我们似乎必须再等一周才能得到正确的答案。而且，我同意Neil的看法。我希望这是财报电话会议。我们应该从他们那里得到那些信息。但这是典型的AMD做法。他们每当几周后有活动时，就会说，“哦，我们会在那里分享更多信息”，也许只是为了给那个活动带来更多关注。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I mean I thought the call I didn't learn anything new. Right. I think the thesis is still intact where and that's not necessarily anything bad, right? I think the thesis is still intact that 2026 with the MI450 is going to be the really strong year for them. Um, even though many people might hate Stacy, it is a great question, right? I think I I don't mind someone being aggressive trying to get the right qu the right answers from AMD. Now, am I mad or do I seem or or um do I think it's bearish that they didn't answer? If I didn't know AMD and Lisa Sue like I do, I probably would, but they never give the answer to that. So, it's it's they're consistent with that. Um, now I agree with Neo that um they uh we have next week to get a lot more updates. Uh I'm hoping to see at least the TAM growth uh because that's what they really promised. put us outside of that. I don't know if they're going to give us any updates on the actual um on maybe any actual GPU numbers. Uh so again, I think for long-term investors, everything we knew, we didn't expect much growth into the 450s. The MI 355 seems to be doing okay. We're expected to see a nice revenue growth next quarter. We're expected to see heavy growth in 2027. They're going to give us luckily next week maybe more updates on the Open AI deal as well. Uh because it does seem like they gave that information. So um unfortunately it seems we have to wait another week to kind of get the right answers and like again I agree with Neil. I wish this is the earnings call. We're supposed to get that information from them. Uh but this is usually typical AMD stuff. They um whenever you have an event coming up in a a few weeks they're like oh we'll share a little bit more there uh maybe just to get some more views. um into that event,</p>
</details>

>> 但现在压力在他们身上，因为他们现在不想分享，下周就必须分享。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> but the pressure is on them now because yeah, they didn't want to share it now, they have to share it next week.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，我确实觉得Lisa Su至少让我们明白了他们下周要发布的东西会是利好消息，比如总目标市场。根据她的说话方式，我期待从她有限的兴奋中，她通常分享的，我期待TAM会增加。他们给了我们，我忘了2028年预计是5000亿美元，我想是上一个数字。如果他们不给我们2028年的数字，而是给我们2029年的数字，我预计它会以一个不错的快速复合年增长率持续增长。所以，虽然她没说太多，但我认为她说至少要对下周感到兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And and I mean I I feel like Lisa Sue at least gave us the understanding that what they're going to release next week is going to be something bullish like the total addressable market. I based on how she talked, I'm expecting um from from her limited um excitement that she usually shares um I'm expecting TAM to increase. They gave us I forget 2028 was expected to be $500 billion I think was uh the last number I if they're not giving us the number for 2028 and they give us the number for 2029, I expect it to continue at some nice rapid compounded annual growth rate over time. So, while she didn't say much, I think she said at least be excited for next week.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。因为每次她谈到那个数字，顺便说一句，那个数字一开始是4000亿美元，对吧？然后变成了5000亿美元。每次她谈到那个数字，她总是说，“是的，有些人认为我对那个数字太保守了”，这可能意味着如果她想的话，她有空间增加那个数字。当然，她必须用她的实际收入来支持它。但如果那个OpenAI的合作关系真的成功了，那就是未来几年他们将获得的千亿美元收入。所以我猜，钱应该是会来的。但是，是的，总而言之，长话短说，没看整个直播的人，好报告，好数字。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Cuz every time she talks about that number, which by the way, that number was $400 billion at first, right? And then it went to $500 billion. And every time she talks about that number, she always like Yeah. And some people think I'm too conservative with that number, which probably means she has some room to increase that number if she wants. Of course, she has to back it up with with her actual revenue. But if that open AI partnership does work out, that's a hundred billion dollars in revenue that they will make for the next couple of years. So I guess I guess there is money that should be coming in. But yeah, all in all, too long didn't watch the whole stream. Good report, good numbers.</p>
</details>

>> 下周见。

<details>

好的，就这样。感谢大家来到这里。那是AMD的财报。我知道盘后市场仍然有点血腥。我们确实看到加密货币有小幅反弹，但显然一切仍然很难看。我们今晚有一个相当重要的选举，所以我们将看看会发生什么，这可能会对本周余下的时间产生影响。比特币现在略高于101000美元，考虑到它曾跌至98000美元，这还不错。然后以太坊……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, there you go. Thank you everybody for being here. That was AMD. I know the after hours markets is a bit bloody still. We did get a little bit of a crypto rebound, but obviously everything is still ugly. We do have a pretty big election tonight, so we're going to see what happens with that and that could have implications throughout the rest of the week. Bitcoin right there just above 101, which is nice given it was at 98 and then Ethereum almost below.</p>
</details>

>> 一个不错的反弹。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> A nice rebound. Yeah.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，我的意思是，至少守住3200美元的水平，也不是世界上最糟糕的事情。好了，就这样。Jose和Neil的YouTube频道，我正在聊天区里放，至少在我的直播里。所以请务必订阅他们。Neil，Couch Investor。我无法言说我有多喜欢他们的频道。我的意思是，我看他们的视频，我把它放在后台听。我特别听Neil的分析。他仍然涵盖了各种各样的股票。所以听很多不同的观点是非常鼓舞人心的。然后是Jose，如果你关心半导体，那就是要听的频道。还有，Neil，恭喜你的美光，伙计。那是……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I mean at least holding the 3200 level is uh is not the worst thing in the world. Um there you go. That's what we got. Jose and Neil's YouTube, I'm putting in the chat, at least on my stream. So, please make sure to subscribe to them. Neil right there, Couch Investor. Uh I I cannot say how much I am a fan of their channels. I mean, I watch their videos. I put it on in the background. I listen to Neil's analysis in particular. still covers a variety of stocks. So, it is very encouraging to listen to a lot of different perspectives. And then Jose, if you care about semiconductors, that is the channel to listen to. Also, uh Neil, congrats on Micron, dude. That's uh</p>
</details>

>> 另一个命中的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> another one that hit.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，相当疯狂。相当疯狂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, quite quite crazy. Quite crazy.</p>
</details>

>> 是的，我前几天在聊天室里问。我说，“谁一直看好美光？”每个人都开始刷屏Neil。我说，“哦，我记得你做过一个视频，那时候那东西才80块钱，你一直持有得很坚定。”所以，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I was asking in the chat the other day. I was like, who's been bullish micron? Everyone started spamming Neil. I was like, "Oh I remember you made a video back when that thing was like 80 bucks and you've been holding it pretty strong." So,</p>
</details>

>> 是的。我的意思是，说法总是，“哦，内存是周期性的。别碰它。”我想，“是的，好吧。”但我不知道你怎么想，但数据中心、GPU，所有这些。你需要大量的HBM，而只有三个主要参与者，其中之一的三星远远落后。美光仍然做得很好。另外，它真的是唯一的美国公司。所以，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> yeah. I mean, the narrative was always, "Oh, memory cyclical. Don't touch it." I'm like, "Yeah, okay." But I don't know about you, but data centers, GPUs, all of that. You got to need a lot of HBM and there are three main players and one of the three Samsung was very much behind. Micron was still doing very well. Plus, it's the only really US player. So,</p>
</details>

同意。

</details>

>> 是的，但我想我今晚不睡了，因为我们有AMD、Astera Lab、Super Micro，而且我很确定我错过了很多其他的，所以最好去喝点咖啡，通宵达旦。

<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, but I don't think I'm sleeping tonight because I mean, we have AMD, Astero Lab, Super Micro, and I'm pretty sure I missed uh so many others that um so better go get some coffee and stay up all night.</p>
