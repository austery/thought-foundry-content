title: 蓝色起源首次载人飞行：太空旅行的商业化与未来展望
---

### 商业太空旅行的可能性

The whole idea here is that you can buy a ticket and cross the Von Karman line, which is the agreed to dotted line over the Earth's surface at which you become, you know, in outer space. And you can call yourself an astronaut. It's a suborbital flight. And if you've got another four or $500,000 burning in your pocket, you can buy a ticket. That's the purpose of this flight.

整个想法是，你可以买一张票，越过卡门线——地球表面上方那条公认的虚线——然后你就算进入了外太空。你可以称自己为宇航员。这是一种亚轨道飞行。如果你还有四五十万美元闲钱，你就可以买一张票。这就是这次飞行的目的。

### 科学探索与成本效益

But it also when there's stop people on board, they can fly it up and do experiments in the same exact capsule. They look at the same capsule and they can do science up there with suborbital exposure to microgravity far cheaper than the U.S. can do it. So they do both things, but it never is. This is not a rocket that's going to take you around the earth. That was never the plan. This is sort of like a Gilligan's Island, like a three hour tour.

但当有乘客在上面时，他们可以在同一个舱内进行飞行并做实验。他们看着同一个舱，并可以在那里进行亚轨道微重力暴露的科学研究，其成本远低于美国目前的方式。所以他们同时做了这两件事，但这永远不是。这不像是一枚能让你绕地球飞行的火箭。那从未是计划。这有点像《吉利根岛》中的“三小时旅行”。

### 私人太空探索的科学和航空视角

Well, Keith, what is what's the purpose from a scientific perspective, from an aeronautical perspective, of some of these privatized flights from Mr. Musk and Mr. Bezos? Well, back in the day, I mean, we hear a lot of people saying there's either commercial space or government space. Companies have always built our rockets, mostly, especially the big important ones, but they've done so under government contract. And the government has pretty much stipulated what they look like or called everything.

那么，基思，从科学角度、从航空角度来看，马斯克和贝佐斯先生的这些私人飞行有什么目的呢？嗯，过去，我们听到很多人说，要么是商业太空，要么是政府太空。公司（主要是大型重要公司）一直都在制造我们的火箭，但它们都是在政府合同下完成的。政府基本上规定了它们的样子或称谓。

### 政府合同向市场驱动的转变

Now, there's been a shift more towards saying, hey, I need to put X amount of stuff, whether it's people, food or science, into space. Hey, rocket companies, can you come back with a way to do this that's more effective in terms of using my money? And so far it seems to be working. The Falcon nine that Musk has developed is exceptionally efficient. It's very cheap. And now we're seeing the Blue Origin again. He has Jeff Bezos. He's got a big rocket, too. He's already launched it once, and he's going to try again very soon to send two missions to Mars. Mike finally, different approaches. Overlapping markets at the end of the day is how can you put more stuff up for more people with less money?

现在，已经出现了一种转变，更多地是说：“嘿，我需要把 X 数量的东西，无论是人、食物还是科学设备，送入太空。嘿，火箭公司，你们能不能想出一个更有效地利用我的钱的方法？”到目前为止，这似乎是奏效的。马斯克开发的猎鹰九号效率极高，而且非常便宜。现在我们又看到了蓝色起源。杰夫·贝佐斯也有一个大火箭。他已经成功发射过一次了，并且很快将再次尝试发送两次火星任务。迈克，最终，不同的方法。归根结底，重叠的市场是如何以更少的钱为更多人运送更多东西？

### 宇航员安全与高昂的票价

Okay. Is what's the safety to the astronauts? I mean, we got a list of people going up. It says here one is anonymous. Paul, is it is it Taylor Swift going up and Blue Origin at least to tell us? Vitaly Ostrovsky, I think is with the Amazon. These are all people that wrote out a big check. Is it like a Saturn five where there's a real propulsion and fuel risk to the launch?

好的。那么，宇航员的安全如何？我的意思是，我们有一份名单，上面是上去的人。这里说有一位是匿名的。保罗，泰勒·斯威夫特要上去吗？蓝色起源至少能告诉我们吗？维塔利·奥斯特洛夫斯基，我认为他在亚马逊。这些人都是掏了大笔钱的人。这像土星五号那样，发射存在真正的推进剂和燃料风险吗？

### 火箭飞行的固有风险与乘客体验

Yeah. Any time you get in a rocket, you're risking it. Whether it's a little rocket or a big rocket, whether it's of the world you play with as a little kid or the ones that these people will ride on a bee. This was designed specifically to take six people or some stuff into space, but I've done the training pretty much that they've done. A brilliant centrifuge is up to six G's, and I've done the microgravity and when it takes off, you're being pulled back by about three, four times your weight. So you your brain says, we are going somewhere and it lasts for a few minutes until the engine shut off and then you're weightless. So it's quite a ride. I mean, this this rival's amusement park rides except in of you're going up. That's a hell of an amusement park. I love Emmet Keith on Fox. It's an amusement park ride. Folks are ready. I feel like Walter Cronkite or T-minus 4 minutes. We going very away from the launch of Blue Origin here with astronauts. This is a manned spaceflight.

是的。任何时候你乘坐火箭，你都在冒险。无论是小火箭还是大火箭，无论是你小时候玩的模型，还是这些人将要乘坐的。这个（New Shepard）是专门设计用来将六人或一些物品送入太空的，但我已经接受了他们所做的绝大部分训练。一个很棒的离心机可以模拟高达六倍的重力，我也体验过微重力，当它起飞时，你会感受到大约三四倍于你体重的拉力。所以你的大脑会告诉你，我们要去某个地方了，这会持续几分钟，直到引擎关闭，然后你就失重了。所以这真是一次刺激的旅程。我的意思是，这堪比游乐园的游乐项目，只不过你是向上飞。那是一个了不起的游乐园。我喜欢福克斯频道上的埃米特·基思。这真是一次游乐园的体验。大家准备好了。我感觉像沃尔特·克朗凯特一样，还剩 T-minus 4 分钟。我们即将从蓝色起源的这次载人航天发射。

### NASA 在太空计划中的角色

Paul, Keith, what's the role of NASA these days in our space program? Well, since we're talking about Blue Origin, what they did is a lot of the technology that you see in this rocket or Elon Musk rockets or rocket lab or any of these other companies derive from all the basic research that Nassar was chartered to do. They were chartered to come up and do these things first and then, like a lot of government agencies, hopefully hand that off to the private sector, say, Hey, we just figured out how to do this. Now you go do it and build our economy and do cool stuff. Right now with this flight here, NASA's involvement is minimal. They buy flights to do some suborbital research because it's much cheaper. They can literally walk up to the launch pad, right? Well, metaphorically, but very close to the launch and say, hey, I want you to fly this thing to see what happens. And you spend a few tens of thousands of dollars to do that on their own would cost much more and you had to wait longer. So NASA's a customer on Blue Origin. NASA is a customer on space.

保罗，基思，美国宇航局（NASA）在我们目前的太空计划中扮演着什么角色？嗯，既然我们在谈论蓝色起源，他们所做的很多技术，你看这枚火箭上的技术，或者埃隆·马斯克的火箭，或者火箭实验室（Rocket Lab）或其他公司的技术，都源于 NASA 最初被授权进行的所有基础研究。他们被授权首先来做这些事情，然后，就像许多政府机构一样，希望将这些技术交给私营部门，说：“嘿，我们已经弄清楚怎么做这个了。现在你们去把它做好，发展我们的经济，做些酷的事情。”目前，对于这次飞行，NASA 的参与是最小的。他们购买飞行服务来进行一些亚轨道研究，因为这要便宜得多。他们可以（字面上）走到发射台，对吧？嗯，这是一个比喻，但非常接近发射现场，然后说：“嘿，我想让你把这个东西飞起来，看看会发生什么。”你只需要花费几万美元就能做到，而他们自己做的话成本会高得多，而且还要等待更长时间。所以 NASA 是蓝色起源的客户。NASA 也是太空（探索）的客户。

### 宇航员的生活方式变迁

Interesting. Keith, I watched a little bit of for All Mankind, and this is where like it's like fake how the Soviets get to the moon first and there's a whole plot to it. I don't want to get into. But Keith, what upset me about it is basically these astronauts, Wally Schirra, Neil Armstrong, the rest of them are guys in Corvettes who drink a lot. What's the reality of the astronaut life at Cape Canaveral? 40, 50 years ago or now? Well, I was I was down there in 1981 when the first shuttle took off and a lot of the places were boarded up. But it was still the had that sixties look to it. I didn't see the Corvettes. I've met most of those guys. They've more or less passed on by now. I have a lot of I can say this I have a lot of friends who are astronauts, and there's a little bit of the silk scarf left with the pilots, but a lot of them are adventurers. And yeah, I mean, one of the people lead the woman who's flying today is a mountaineer. I mean, I spent a month at Everest Base camp while my friend, who's an astronaut, climbed up to the summit. And I've other friends who've been submariners and done a lot of exploration stuff. You're moving more now towards people who do science and also the people who know how to do the stuff that's all filled with the big words science when they get to the moon to go to Mars. So it's shifting. I think maybe a few them. I know a couple of them have Corvettes, maybe have airplanes, but they're not driving around picking up young girls and getting speeding tickets and carrying

有趣。基思，我看了《For All Mankind》的一点点，里面就像是苏联人先登月一样是虚构的，还有很多情节。我不想深入探讨。但基思，让我感到不安的是，这些宇航员，像沃利·希拉、尼尔·阿姆斯特朗，以及其他人都像是开着雪佛兰科尔维特、并且酗酒的人。40、50年前或者现在的卡纳维拉尔角，宇航员的生活真实情况是怎样的？嗯，1981年我曾在那儿，当第一架航天飞机起飞时，很多地方都关门了。但它仍然带着那个60年代的风格。我没看到科尔维特。我认识其中大多数人，他们差不多都已过世了。我有许多朋友是宇航员，其中一些人还保留着飞行员的那种飘逸气质，但他们中的许多人是冒险家。是的，我的意思是，今天飞行的那位女性领导者是一位登山家。我曾在珠峰大本营待了一个月，而我的宇航员朋友则登上了顶峰。我还有些朋友当过潜艇员，做过很多探索性质的事情。现在你们越来越多地转向从事科学研究的人，以及那些懂得如何在登月或登陆火星时处理复杂事物的人。所以情况正在发生变化。我想也许有少数人。我知道有几个人有科尔维特，也许还有飞机，但他们不会开车到处去接年轻女孩、吃超速罚单、还带着……

### 太空探索的下一个重大里程碑

giving us perspective here that only he can do with NASA's watch. We're T minus 2 minutes. Excuse me, T minus one minute, 56 seconds and counting. Paul from Cape Canaveral. He puts the next big, big milestone for just the overall space program. Do you think Is it the moon? Is it Mars? What is it? Well, you know, there's a pendulum that goes back and forth, and I sort of have a neck ache over these years, like watching a tennis match. Are we going to the moon? Going to Mars? Both Neither are going, yeah. Right now, it seems the Trump administration is going to cut back on the go to the moon thing. Look at your wife's thing. Go to Mars. They seem to have sped up or shrunk the timeline here. But the problem is, of course, with the government as a whole, the budgets to do this. Oh, and we're going to be China. So, you know, that seems to be the thing right now is we're going to go to the moon, be China, then we're going to go to Mars, be China there, except they're firing a quarter of the workforce that NASA's gutting the budget. So I'm not sure how they can accomplish the political means if their budgetary realities simply don't match up. But, you know, just stay with us. Keep going with us here of NASA. Watch as he watches the liftoff as well. We're less than one minute away from the launch. 50 seconds and counting, as they say.

他（指嘉宾）为我们提供了只有他能以 NASA 的视角才能给出的见解。现在是 T-minus 2 分钟。抱歉，T-minus 1 分钟 56 秒，正在倒计时。保罗从卡纳维拉尔角发回报道。他提出了整个太空计划下一个非常非常重大的里程碑。你认为会是月球吗？是火星吗？是什么？嗯，你知道，就像钟摆一样来回摆动，这些年来我脖子都酸了，就像看一场网球比赛。我们要去月球吗？去火星吗？两者都不是，都不去，是的。目前，特朗普政府似乎要削减去月球的计划。看看你妻子的事（指代某个节目或言论）。去火星。他们似乎加快了步伐，缩短了时间表。但问题是，当然，就整个政府而言，这笔预算。哦，我们还要和中国竞争。所以，你知道，现在似乎是这样的：我们将要登月，成为中国，然后我们将要去火星，在那里也成为中国，只是他们正在解雇 NASA 四分之一的员工，削减预算。所以我不知道他们如何在预算现实与政治目标之间取得平衡。但是，你知道，请继续关注我们。继续关注 NASA。观看他（指记者）观看发射。离发射还有不到一分钟。正如他们所说，还有 50 秒。

### New Shepard 载人发射进行时

This is Cape Canaveral. Blue Origin is a manned spaceflight. Well, Jeff, Virgin Dan occurs because of a Clint Kelly who has flown before, Erin Newman, Vitaly Ostrovsky, and an undisclosed six crew member who asked to remain anonymous. Paul, you and I love the windows in the capsule. It wasn't like that. An Apollo to the moon was that little tiny window on the door, 20 feet. Let's listen. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four. Command engine start. Two, one. Right here. Shepherd has cleared the tower. If you look on the bottom right hand side of your screen, you'll be able to follow along for the timing as Ness 36 Chamber Crusher Looks Good on Bloomberg Radio. Across the nation, on radio, the images are, as you'd expect, 10,000 feet and climbing.

这是卡纳维拉尔角。蓝色起源正在进行载人航天飞行。嗯，杰夫，丹·维尔京（Dan Virgin）……（此处口误，信息不明确）……克林特·凯利（Clint Kelly），他之前飞过，艾琳·纽曼（Erin Newman），维塔利·奥斯特洛夫斯基（Vitaly Ostrovsky），以及一位未公开身份、要求匿名的第六名乘员。保罗，你和我都很喜欢太空舱里的窗户。以前不是这样的。阿波罗登月时，只有一个那么小的窗户，在门上，离得很远。我们来听听。十，九，八，七，六，五，四。指令引擎启动。二，一。就在这里。牧羊人号（Shepherd）已通过发射塔。如果你看屏幕的右下角，你就可以跟着时间同步，正如彭博电台（Bloomberg Radio）报道的那样，36 号舱压碎机看起来不错。Across the nation，在广播中，画面正如你所料，一万英尺，并且还在攀升。

### 飞行高度与引擎特性

To me, what's so important here? Going up 66 miles. It's not the big, huge flames now associate with a nest. You get different kind of ignition there and launch of another a little rocky day on the clouds. You can still hear ordered clouds or clouds here. It's Florida. No, actually, it's Texas. They're in west Texas. Excuse me for the launch surveillance correction. And that was my error is well, looking at original Blue Origin flights, again, up only 66 miles. There you come in line the the imagery on YouTube above the clouds. It's about as high as you get coming out of New York. Yeah. Things that you can watch. So speed in the altitude climb easier. They had no time to wait so I don't right up right on time. So there you go. We welcome all of you who will wait to see how this works out here. We're one minute, 30 seconds into the flight as well. He's coming with us. So let's go back to him for a few more insights here.

对我来说，这里最重要的是什么？上升 66 英里。它不像“巢”（Nest，此处可能指代其他火箭）那样伴随着巨大、熊熊的火焰。你会在那里看到不同类型的点火，以及在云层中又一次有些颠簸的发射。你仍然可以听到有序的云或者这里的云。这是佛罗里达。不，实际上，这是德克萨斯州。他们在西德克萨斯。抱歉，发射监控有误。这也是我的错误，再次看看蓝色起源最初的飞行，只上升了 66 英里。在那里，你在 YouTube 上可以看到云层之上的景象。这差不多和你离开纽约时的高度一样。是的。你可以看到这些东西。所以速度和爬升高度更容易。他们没有时间等待，所以我……准时升空。好了，欢迎所有等待看这次飞行结果的各位。我们已经飞行了 1 分 30 秒。他（指主持人）还在和我们在一起。所以我们再回到他那里，听取更多见解。

### 蓝色起源的可靠性与市场定位

Where does this lead, Keith? Where does Mr. Bezos take Blue Origin? Well, this this here was I don't want to say it's J.V. practice, but they built a launch system that's very reliable, very safe. And he started from scratch. And that's given him a company that, you know, has some confidence in being able to do that. And, of course, then the next step was they kind of went from riding a bicycle to writing, which is learning how to fly a jet fighter. They just said, all right, we know how to do this and bam, we're going to build a big rocket because there's a market out there. And so they've had a lot of success, some delays. It's it always takes longer sometimes to do things. And it's it's a tired example. But I often use it back in the day when you and I, our parents said, oh, it's too expensive to fly to the right, the Far East, that Pan-Am pioneered the idea of flying there. And after that became popular, some said, Hey, I can make a bigger plane that could do it cheaper. But it's always somehow the rich people or the folks with a little spare cash that they can do things first. That's to find out what's happening here. This is home. As matter of fact, the day when they said we're going to launch one of these, I typed it on Keith. Jim Paul's Sweeney's good question. What does Mr. Musk want to do? What is the Keith Cowing timeline of what Elon Musk is being more ambitious about?

这会导向何方，基思？贝佐斯先生将把蓝色起源带向何处？嗯，我想说，他们建立了一个非常可靠、非常安全的发射系统。他白手起家。这让他拥有了一家有信心能做到这一点的公司。当然，下一步是他们从骑自行车过渡到……就像学习驾驶喷气式战斗机一样。他们只是说：“好吧，我们知道怎么做，然后，砰，我们要造一个大火箭，因为那里有市场。”所以他们取得了很多成功，也遇到了一些延误。做事有时总会花费更长的时间。这是一个老生常谈的例子，但我想起过去，当我和我的父母说，“哦，飞往远东太贵了，”泛美航空（Pan-Am）开创了飞往那里的先河。在那变得流行之后，有人说：“嘿，我可以造一架更大的飞机，成本更低。”但总是富人或者有闲钱的人，他们能先去做这些事情。这是为了找出这里正在发生什么。这是家。事实上，就在他们说我们要发射其中一个的时候，我在凯斯的（节目中）打出这句话。（此处引用一位记者的问题）吉姆·保罗·斯威尼（Jim Paul's Sweeney）问了一个好问题：马斯克先生想做什么？基思·科温（Keith Cowing）关于埃隆·马斯克更宏伟计划的时间表是什么？

### SpaceX 的迭代式开发与火星目标

Well, next week, Monday, apparently, we're going to see another starship attempt. And they're trying to you know, they take the approach that NASA doesn't NASA's takes years. They launch. They make sure it's absolutely perfect. They spent a lot of money to do that. Whereas with Musk, they launch if something blows up, they learn something, they expect things to blow up. They build upon its its product development cycles at a fast pace. Now, they got to get to the point. They've cut some deals with the ACA to say, Hey, we're going to use this rocket to land your guys in the moon. And the last couple of times it hasn't exactly done everything it's supposed to do. So the NASA folks are biting their fingers. But but, you know, out of all the fire in the strumming, the drone and all the explosions, you get a good rocket. And I think that's where they're heading now. They have an improved version where it's much more as though he wants to go to Mars. But this money apparently, and doing other things that helps build the cash reserves to pay to go to Mars. So ultimately, he wants to go to Mars. Full stop.

嗯，下周一，据称，我们将看到另一次星舰（Starship）的尝试。他们采取的是一种方法，你知道，NASA 需要很多年。他们会发射，确保一切绝对完美，为此花费大量资金。而马斯克则不同，他们会发射，如果有什么东西爆炸了，他们就能学到东西，他们预期东西会爆炸。他们以快速的步伐进行产品开发。现在，他们需要达到一个阶段。他们与美国宇航局（NASA）达成了一些协议，表示：“嘿，我们将使用这枚火箭将你们的人送上月球。”而过去几次，它并没有完全达到预期。所以 NASA 的人们都在焦急等待。但是，你知道，在所有的火焰、轰鸣和爆炸之后，你会得到一枚优秀的火箭。我认为这就是他们现在的方向。他们已经有了一个改进版本，看起来更像是他想去火星。但显然，他们通过这些花钱的方式，并做其他事情，来积累支付去火星的现金储备。所以最终，他想去火星。一锤定音。
