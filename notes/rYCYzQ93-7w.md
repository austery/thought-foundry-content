### 多伦多交通拥堵与公共交通的未来

**主持人**: 多伦多的交通问题众所周知。有人在多伦多拍过电影，也有朋友在那里。多伦多的交通到底是怎么回事？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Toronto's traffic problems are well known. Made movies in Toronto. And I visited Toronto and friends in Toronto. What's up with the traffic in Toronto?

</details>

**主持人**: 我不知道。你可能认出了那个人，是汤姆·克鲁斯几年前谈论多伦多出名的一件事，但不是好事。我们一直在谈论它，抱怨它，有时为之咆哮，感觉像是永远。去任何地方有多难，需要多长时间，街道有多拥挤。我们知道，不仅仅是沮丧感很糟糕。交通堵塞还会带来巨大的经济损失。那么，我们的领导人是否终于开始采取行动来解决这个问题了呢？然后，让更多汽车离开道路的一种方法是：良好的公共交通。别只听我说的，听听 Metrolinx 的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I don't know. You probably recognize that guy. It's Tom Cruise a couple of years ago talking about one of the things Toronto is famous for, but not in a good way. We've been talking about it, complaining about it, sometimes yelling about it for what feels like forever. How hard is it to get anywhere, how long it takes to get anywhere, how congested the streets are. And we know it's not just the frustration that's bad. Gridlock also takes a huge economic toll. So how much does it cost us and our leaders finally shifting into high gear to do something about it? Then one way to get more cars off the road. Good public transit. Don't take my word for it. Here's Metrolinx.

</details>

**主持人**: 扩大公共交通将通过减少道路上的汽车来缓解拥堵。每天该地区有 700,000 更多高峰时段的出行，我们确实扩大了 GO 服务。安大略线即将到来，备受期待的 Eglinton Crosstown 轻轨预计将于 2 月份开放。我们拭目以待。但这会带来多大改变呢？我们来看看在 2026 年及以后，通勤者是否能期待一次更顺畅的旅程。这是 The Rundown。交通拥堵不仅仅是通勤者的巨大头痛，它还伴随着高昂的代价。研究表明，它可能每年给大多伦多和汉密尔顿地区带来 447 亿的经济和社会价值。我与多伦多地区商会会长兼首席执行官 Giles Gershon 谈了谈其中的经济风险，以及他认为我们应该采取什么路线来摆脱这种困境。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Expanding public transit will ease congestion by getting cars off the road. With 700,000 more rush hour trips on transit each day throughout the region, and we do have expanded GO service. The Ontario line is on the horizon, and word is the long, long anticipated Eglinton Crosstown LRT is supposed to open in February. We'll see about that. But how much of a difference will that make? We look at whether transit users can look forward to a smoother ride in 2026 and beyond. This is The Rundown. Traffic congestion isn't just a massive headache for commuters, it also comes with a hefty price tag. Research suggests it could be costing the Greater Toronto and Hamilton area 44.7 billion a year in economic and social value. I talked to Giles Gershon, president and CEO of the Toronto Region Board of Trade, about the financial stakes and what route he thinks we should take to get out of this mess.

</details>

**主持人**: 让我们来谈谈那个价格标签。当我们谈论 400 亿时，价格相当高昂。但请帮助我们理解，当我们谈论经济和社会价值时，这对城市来说究竟意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Let's talk about that price tag. Pretty hefty when we talk about $40 billion. But help us understand what does that actually mean for cities when we talk about economic and social value.

</details>

**Shoshana Sachs**: 很多事情。正如你所描述的，它确实是这样，但这里有两个因素：经济和生活质量。这两者结合起来，城市才能繁荣、发展并充满活力。出行便利性是其中的核心。或者说连接性，如果你想用这个词的话。当我们面临当前的交通拥堵危机时，它确实阻碍了这种连接性。这意味着，如果我需要在城市内或跨城市运送产品或服务，或者进出城市，这将花费我更长的时间。这就是成本，对吧？如果我是一名水管工或电工，我需要进行服务呼叫。我能完成的服务呼叫会少得多。这会减少我的收入，或者我会收取更高的费用。所以这变成了一个生活成本问题，对吧？由于出行困难，你看到成本在上涨。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shoshana Sachs**: A whole bunch of things. So it and it's kind of as you described it, but you've really got two factors here. You've got the economy and you've got quality of life. And the two kind of come together for a city to be prosperous and grow and be vibrant. Mobility is at the heart of that. Or connectivity, if you want to use that word. And when you've got the congestion crisis that we have, it really impedes that connectivity. So it means that if I'm delivering a product or service around the city or across the city or out of the city or into the city, that's taking me a lot longer. That's cost, right? If I'm a plumber or an electrician, I'm doing service calls. I'm going to do far fewer calls. That's going to reduce my income or I'm going to charge more. So it becomes a cost of living problem, right? You're seeing costs rise because of the difficulty of getting around the city.

</details>

**Shoshana Sachs**: 在另一个层面上，是公司是否会来这里扩张、在这里发展、在这里投资，或者因为发现难以雇佣员工（因为他们无法出行）而离开这座城市，或者仅仅是运送货物和服务太困难而选择搬到别处。所以，作为商会，我们知道有许多大型国际公司曾将多伦多列入扩张名单，但最终没有选择这里，就是因为交通拥堵。而且，全世界都知道多伦多有严重的交通拥堵问题。我们是全球交通拥堵问题最严重的十个城市之一。这本不该如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shoshana Sachs**: At another level, it's companies coming to expand here, to grow here, to invest here or not, or leave the city because they find it too hard to get employees here because they can't get around, or that it's just to get back to the delivery of goods and services is too difficult. Move to another place. So so we know as a board of Trade that there are a number of large international companies that, you know, that put Toronto on their short list for an expansion for, you know, and they didn't come because of because of congestion. And it's kind of well known around the world that Toronto has an acute congestion problem. And it's one of, you know, we're in the top ten globally of, you know, of congestion problem. And it shouldn't be.

</details>

**主持人**: 当然，这不值得我们骄傲。好吧。我想谈谈。我们现在位于 Yonge 和 Eglinton 的拐角处。Eglinton Crosstown 备受关注。还没有确切的日期。我们不必深究。但你认为这条跨城线能否帮助缓解你刚才提到的这些成本？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Something we should be proud of, of course. All right. I want to talk. We are at the corner of Yonge and Eglinton. Lots of attention on the Eglinton Crosstown. Still don't have an exact date. We don't need to get into that. But do you see the crosstown helping alleviate some of these costs that you just talked about?

</details>

**Shoshana Sachs**: 完全可以。我的意思是，我认为这条跨城线不会是“改变游戏规则的因素”。我认为安大略线加上 Eglinton，你知道，还有通勤铁路，GO 的大规模扩张和电气化，这将提高全天候双向 GO 服务的速度，区域铁路，这些项目将在未来 8 到 9 年内汇集。这还需要一些等待，但它们将是彻底的改变者。但即使是跨城线本身，你知道，在核心区的北部，那将是一个显著的改善。但我必须说，如果它要产生它需要产生的改变，它就不能出现像刚开通的 Finch West 那样的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shoshana Sachs**: Absolutely. I mean, I think the crosstown will be I'm not going to say a game changer. I think the Ontario line plus Eglinton, you know, but also when you look at commuter rail, the massive expansion that's coming to go and electrification of go, which will speed up service, you know, all day, two way go, regional rail, these projects coming together over the next 8 or 9 years. That's a bit of a wait, but that will be those will be a game changer altogether. But even the crosstown itself will, you know, in the northern part of the northern part of the core, that will be that will be a significant improvement. But I will say this, if it is going to make the kind of difference that it needs to make, it can't have the same problems that Finch West has, which is just opened.

</details>

**Shoshana Sachs**: 我在圣诞节前在巴黎参加了一个会议，我不得不乘坐类似 Eglinton 或 Sinclair 的交通工具。有一条轻轨沿着一条叫做 Berthier Boulevard 的街道中心运行。Berthier 看起来非常相似。我们停下来让人们上下车，然后我们穿过交通信号灯，速度达到了大约……可能看起来比实际快，但时速大约是 40 到 50 公里。哦，哇。所以我们实际上很快就从 A 点到达了 B 点。我之所以选择它，是因为我有一个表亲住在那里，但我来回去了很多次，这太棒了。我当时想到了 Saint Clair，并想到了 Finch，当然还有 Eglinton，我们是否会有信号优先系统，例如，让你更快地通过交通信号灯到达 B 点？那样人们就会选择它，对吧？可靠性和速度是公共交通的核心。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shoshana Sachs**: I was in Paris before Christmas, at a conference, and I had to take a kind of almost like Eglinton or Sinclair. There's an LRT running down the centre of a street called Berthier Boulevard. Berthier looks very similar. We stopped to let people on and off, and then we whizzed through traffic lights and we got to speeds of about. Probably seems like faster than it probably was, but it was maybe 40 to 50 km an hour. Oh, wow. So we actually got from A to B very quickly. I took that because I had a cousin living there, but I went back and forth quite a lot and it was amazing. And I kind of thought back to Saint Clair and I wondered about the, you know, I thought about Finch and, and of course, Eglinton and are we going to have signal signalling priority, for example, that will take you through traffic lights and get you A to B much more quickly? Then people will take it, right? Right. Reliability and speed are core to to transit.

</details>

**Shoshana Sachs**: 谈到速度，你曾说过，通勤者乘坐公共交通，他们就知道自己需要等待。当我们谈论 Eglinton Crosstown 15 年的建设工期，比原定开放的 Finch West 晚了 6 年，大约 4 年。这类项目的建设延误只是常态。当我们谈论公共交通，或者你规划 GO 和安大略线时，我们应该知道吗？那里有很多承诺，有很多兴奋。但这伴随着漫长、漫长的等待。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shoshana Sachs**: Speaking of speed, you had talked about sort of it's kind of like commuters in transit. Riders just know that they're going to have to wait. When we talk about the Eglinton Crosstown 15 years to construct, six years later than when it was originally supposed to open Finch West, approximately four years. Our construction delays in these types of projects just par for the course. Are we supposed to know when we talk about, you know, transit or kind of you lay out the go and you lay out Ontario line. There's a lot of promise there. There's a lot of excitement there. But it comes with this, this large, long, long wait.

</details>

**Shoshana Sachs**: 我认为这里的常态，或者说过去一直是常态。我认为过去不是序章。当你与那些正在参与安大略线项目或 GO 电气化扩张项目的人交谈时，他们正在使用截然不同的技术。我们在一年前左右发布了商会的一份报告，名为《进步的代价》。我们发现，多伦多每公里建设交通的成本存在巨大、巨大的差距，接近 8 亿美元，而欧洲城市，如米兰、巴黎、伦敦、巴塞罗那、伊斯坦布尔，成本在 1 亿至 3 亿美元之间。为什么？他们规划项目的方式？这完全是关于规划。你必须非常仔细地规划，你知道吗？所以一切都源于规划。我认为我们目前的新项目比我所认为的当前项目规划得要好得多，我们仍在处理项目的治理问题。看看 Eglinton，那里的争议，各方之间、其他国家之间的纠纷。现在我们正在转向一种联盟模式，将所有各方聚集在一起，明确谁具体做什么？谁具体负责什么？我们如何具体合作？这样你就不会出现这些纠纷？这是造成延误的一个巨大因素。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shoshana Sachs**: You know, I think par for the course here or has been par for the course here. I don't think past is prologue. When you talk to the folks who are on the Ontario working on the Ontario Line or on the go electrification expansion, they're using very different techniques. We did a report out of the Board of Trade about a year and a bit ago called The Price of Progress. And what we found was this massive, massive gap in the cost of building transit in Toronto per kilometre, like nearly $800 million versus Europe, European cities, Milan, Paris, London, Barcelona, Istanbul, where it's between 100 and $300 million. Why? The way they plan their project? It's all about planning. You got to plan very carefully, you know? And so every thing kind of emanates from planning. Our new projects are being much better planned than I think the current ones that we're kind of still addressing the governance of the project. Look at Eglinton, the disputes right there, legion between the various parties, other countries.

</details>

**Shoshana Sachs**: 然后是技术的使用。我们使用技术的效果远不如欧洲人，例如数字孪生技术，我们在规划过程中现在正在使用它。欧洲人已经使用了一段时间了。我们过去没有使用过。隧道和车站的标准化对我们来说是新的，但他们在欧洲一直在这样做。然后，另一个关键因素可能是，在多伦多和安大略省，我们通常只做零散的项目。你启动一个项目，用那个团队完成它，解散它，过段时间再启动另一个项目，一个全新的团队，全新的工作方式。这在欧洲需要很长时间。它是一个项目流，连续的流动。你从过去的项目中学习，并将这些经验应用到下一个项目中。这有很大的不同。我们在安大略省的核能领域也在这样做，对吧？巨大的成果。是的。所以这些是我们现在正在做的一些以前没有做过的事情。这应该在加快项目方面产生巨大影响。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shoshana Sachs**: And now we are moving to an alliance model where you pull all the parties together and who does what exactly? Who's responsible for what exactly? How are we going to collaborate exactly? So you don't end up with these disputes? That's a huge factor in the delays. And then it's the use of technology. We haven't been using technology nearly as well as the Europeans digital twin technology, for example, when in the planning process we're using it now. The Europeans have been using it for a while. We haven't used it in the past. A standardization of tunnels and and stations new to us, but they've been doing that in Europe. And then probably another key factor is in Toronto and in Ontario we've typically done episodic projects. You start a project, you finish it with that team, you collapse it, start another one some other time, a whole new team, whole new way of working. That takes a lot of time in Europe. It's a flow of projects, continuous flow. You learn from the past projects, you apply those learnings to the next project on you go. And that has a big difference. We're doing that in nuclear in Ontario, right? Huge results. Right. And so those are some of the things that we are now doing that we didn't do before. That should make a big difference in speeding up the projects.

</details>

**主持人**: 在此之上，当我们谈论资助公共交通时，商业是否发挥作用？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: On top of that, is there a role for business when we talk about funding transit?

</details>

**Marco D'Angelo**: 嗯，我的意思是，商业，显然，你知道，我们商业有员工，员工使用公共交通，他们支付公共交通费用。你知道，我不认为应该有任何特别的税收，如果你是这么说的。我认为公共交通是我认为，多伦多的房产税，60% 的房产税用于公共交通。谁支付商业房产税？但我们在工业和商业地产方面的税率比北美其他地方要高。所以商业正在为公共交通买单。话虽如此，它却资金严重不足，建设也严重不足。但这并不是商业的角色。我认为有一些方法，例如 TTC，可以进行财务重组，拥有更好的资本基础并为其运营提供资金。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Marco D'Angelo**: Well, I mean, I mean business, obviously, you know, we business has employees, employees use transit, they pay for transit. You know, I don't think there should be any special levy, if that's what you're saying. I think transit is something that I mean, property taxes pay in Toronto, 60% of property taxes go to transit. And who pays the commercial property tax. But we have higher rates here for industrial and and commercial property than other places in North America. So business is paying for transit. Having said that, it is woefully underfunded and it's woefully underbuilt. But that's not a role for business.

</details>

**Marco D'Angelo**: 目前，它在为其运营提供资金方面存在巨大问题。事实上，当 Eglinton 上线时，TTC 的运营成本将大幅增加。维护、修理，一切都如此。我不确定他们是否有这笔资金。哦，好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Marco D'Angelo**: I think there are ways that the TTC, for example, could be restructured financially to have a better capital base and to and to fund its operations. Right now, it's got a huge problem with funding its operations. In fact, when Eglinton comes on stream, that's going to lift the operating cost of the TTC substantially. Maintenance, repair, everything else. I'm not sure they have the funds for it. Oh, okay.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。在我们最后几分钟里，有一些建议，当我们谈论的不仅仅是这里的公共交通，还有拥堵，我们的交通堵塞问题，你有什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Something we'll have to to watch for in terms of in the last couple of minutes that we have recommendations when we talk about not just transit here but congestion, our gridlock problem, what do you have?

</details>

**Shoshana Sachs**: 嗯，我们发布了一份名为“行动计划”的报告。实际上去年被市政府采纳了。我们对此非常满意。市长采纳了它，议会也采纳了。我们的建议之一是设立交通专员，拥堵专员。他们刚刚任命了一位拥堵专员。但我们确实认为，我们需要市府一位非常高级别的联络人，能够跨部门工作，并专注于如何解决这个大问题。这个人必须拥有重要的权力，因为你知道，一切都是权衡。过去我们做了多次权衡，但拥堵问题并未解决。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shoshana Sachs**: Well, we put out a report called an action plan. Actually last year was adopted by the city. We were very pleased with that. The mayor adopted it and so did council. One of our recommendations was have a traffic commissioner, a congestion commissioner. They've just appointed a congestion commissioner. But we really thought that was we needed a point person at a very senior level at City Hall who would be able to work across the departments and focus on how do I solve this big problem. That person has to have significant authority because, you know, everything is a trade off. And in the past we make multiple trade offs and congestion does not get resolved.

</details>

**Shoshana Sachs**: 所以你将不得不为了交通流量而做出权衡。但这些包括实施智能信号系统，如人工智能赋能的信号系统，这是其他城市广泛使用的。我们一直非常缓慢地采用。我们现在有试点项目，可以在没有交叉交通的情况下自由移动交通，你不会坐在红灯前而没有人来。你知道，所以你有这个，然后你有像我们有主要动脉这样的事情。作为一个大城市，我们拥有相对较少的主要动脉。我们需要恢复到双车道交通，对吧？我们过去是这样的。但现在它们常常因路边停车而减少。也许是轻轨或有轨电车、轨道、咖啡馆和自行车道。所有这些事物现在都基本上关闭了我们的一些主要动脉，使拥堵变得更糟。拥堵专员应负责制定一项缓解这些主要动脉拥堵的计划。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shoshana Sachs**: So you're going to have to make trade offs in favour of traffic flow. But those are things like putting in place smart signalling like AI enabled signalling, which other cities are using in abundance. We've been very slow to adopt. We have pilot projects now that you can that would move traffic freely where there is no cross traffic coming, you don't sit there at a red light and nobody's coming. Why you know, so you've got that, then you've got things like we've got major art. We have relatively few major arteries as a big city. We need to get back to two lanes of traffic, right? Which we had in the past. But often now they're reduced by on street parking. Maybe, maybe LRT or streetcars, track, cafe and bike lanes.

</details>

**Shoshana Sachs**: 还有一件事，我们进行了大量的建设，大量的建筑项目，建造公寓等等。通常会有一条车道停止服务，对吧？你可以在一条主要动脉上行驶，并在进出城市的路线上遇到 3 或 4 个这样的情况。这种情况经常发生。但实际上，当你仔细想想，过去城市对占用一条车道收费很少。其他城市要么禁止，要么收费很高。所以你减少了那条车道停止服务的时间，因为它会让你花费很多钱。因此，我们建议城市大幅提高成本，特别是在主要动脉上，以减少其频率并缩短占用时间。这些是城市现在已经采纳为政策的事情，但现在我们需要看到它们得到实施。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shoshana Sachs**: All of those things have now really shut down, essentially some of our major arteries making congestion a lot worse. The the congestion commissioner should have responsibility for a plan for easing congestion on those on those major arteries. One other thing, we've had a lot of construction, a lot of a lot of construction projects, building condos and so on. Often a lane is taken out of service, right? And you could go down a major artery and have 3 or 4 of those on your route into, into the city or out. Happens a lot. But but really, you know, when you think about it, the city has charged in the past relatively little to take a lane out of service. Other cities either ban it right or charge a lot. So you reduce the amount of time that that lane is taken out of service because it costs you a lot of money. And so we recommended that that the city massively increase the cost, particularly on major arteries, so that you reduce the frequency of those and you reduce the time taken. Those are things that the city has now adopted as policy, but now we have to see them implemented.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。看起来要达到我们的目标还有一段颠簸的路要走。但那里有很多希望。所以，期待着。这对城市的未来至关重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. Seems like a bumpy road to to get us to where we need to. But there's a lot of promise there. So looking.

</details>

**Shoshana Sachs**: 期待着。这对城市的未来至关重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shoshana Sachs**: Forward to it. It's critical to the future of the city.

</details>

**主持人**: 我们就到这里。非常感谢。非常感谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: We're going to leave it there. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it.

</details>

**Gio Petti**: 不仅仅是司机抱怨出行困难。公共交通用户也一直在忍受漫长的等待时间、不可靠的服务和充满压力的通勤。但安大略省的情况可能开始有所改变。他们正在加强多伦多的区域 GO 服务，安大略线，以及终于，Eglinton Crosstown 轻轨也即将投入使用。渥太华，其轻轨系统至少可以说经历了一段坎坷的旅程，正在扩大其 O-Train 服务。这是一个令人印象深刻的名单，还有一些漂亮的地图，但宏大的计划和新闻稿并不总意味着实际的改变正在发生。那么，现在公共交通用户应该感到乐观吗？我问了多伦多大学土木与矿业工程系的副教授 Shoshana Sachs，她也是纪录片《A Train to Nowhere》关于渥太华交通的播客和制片人，以及加拿大城市交通协会会长兼首席执行官 Marco D'Angelo。非常感谢你们两位来到演播室，Marco 感谢你加入我们的电话连线。Shauna，我先问你。根据昨天的新闻，Eglinton Crosstown 轻轨有望最终投入运营。我不会承诺具体日期，因为我知道这还不确定。TTC 的首席执行官当然不会承诺 2 月 8 日的日期，但从这个项目的历史来看，城市能从中吸取什么教训吗？15 年的建设，比原定交付时间晚了 6 年？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gio Petti**: It's not just drivers who complain about getting from A to B. Transit users have been struggling long wait times, unreliable service, stressful commutes. But things could be starting to change in Ontario. They're beefing up regional GO service in Toronto, the Ontario Line, and at long last, the Eglinton Crosstown LRT are on their way. Ottawa, where the light rail system has had a bumpy ride, to say the least, is expanding its O-Train service. That's a pretty impressive list, and some pretty maps, but big plans and press releases don't always mean real changes on the way. So should transit users be feeling optimistic right now? I asked Shoshana Sachs, associate professor in the University of Toronto's Department of Civil and Mineral Engineering Gio Petti, podcaster and producer of documentaries like A Train to Nowhere about Ottawa Transit and Marco D'Angelo, president and CEO of the Canadian Urban Transit Association. Thank you, too, for joining us in studio and Marco for joining us on the line. Shauna, I'm going to start with you. Based on yesterday's news, there's hope that the Eglinton Crosstown LRT will finally be operational. I'm not going to commit to a date because I know that's sort of up in the air. The TTC CEO, of course, won't commit to the February 8th date, but is there a lesson here for cities just about its history that we can take away from how this whole project started? 15 years of construction, six years later than when it was supposed to be delivered?

</details>

**Shoshana Sachs**: 哦，有太多教训了，很难只挑一个，但我认为我会选择这个。你不能将责任外包。在公私合作伙伴关系开始时，有一种想法认为，我们签订合同的方式会让其他人来为我们交付。而当我们真正想要某样东西时，我们不能让它成为别人的问题。我们必须保持参与。我们必须承担责任。所以，那种认为公私合作伙伴关系模式只会让别人来解决问题的幻想，我们就能得到我们想要的。一切都不会再昂贵了。我们不能购买这些幻想。伟大的事业需要辛勤工作、承诺和坚持。这才是我们在城市中完成更多公共交通的唯一途径。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shoshana Sachs**: Oh, there's so many lessons that it's hard to pick one, but I think I'll go with that. You can't contract out responsibility. There was this idea at the beginning of the public private partnership that the way we made the contract would make it other people's problems to deliver for us. And when we really want something, we can't make it other people's problems. We have to stay involved. We have to keep responsibility. And so the fantasy that the OPP model was just going to make it other people's problems, we're going to get what we want. Nothing would ever be expensive again. We can't buy into those fantasies. Big things require hard work, commitment and follow through. And that's the only way we're going to get more transit done in our cities.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的，Marco，同样的问题问你。我们 Eglinton Crosstown 的历史对其他城市有什么教训吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right, Marco, same question to you. Is there a lesson here for other cities about our history here with the Eglinton Crosstown?

</details>

**Marco D'Angelo**: 嗯，我的意思是，加拿大在过去十年中一直在进行大规模的交通建设。当然，安大略省是最明显的例子之一。而且，你知道，这需要被注意到。你知道，渥太华市去年也开通了两条轻轨线路。准时率在一年中有所提高。现在，冬季在 TTC 开通时出现了一些挑战。Finch 我认为是一个很好的进步。当然，安大略省和全国其他主要项目的进展，比如温哥华的百老汇地铁，蒙特利尔蓝线的延伸，全国各地都在进行大型项目，每个项目都面临独特的挑战。但它们共同点在于，资金的确定性确实有助于确保这些项目能够向前推进。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Marco D'Angelo**: Well, I mean, Canada is in the major transit build out over the last decade. And of course, Ontario is one of the the clearest examples. And, you know, it's it's it goes I think it needs to be noted. You know, the two LRT lines opened in the city of Ottawa last year as well. The the on time percentage improved through the year. Now, there have been challenges during the winter at TTC opening. Finch I think was a very good step. And certainly the advancement on other major projects across the province of Ontario and across the country as well, like the Broadway subway in Vancouver, the extensions of the Blue Line in Montreal, there's there's big projects that are happening across the country, each of which face unique challenges. But where they come together is that funding certainty is really what helps to ensure that these projects are able to move forward.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。我们稍后会谈钱的问题。但我想问你，作为一个交通系统的使用者和倡导者，你看到了什么与渥太华的 O-Train 相似之处？我确定你肯定听说过，即使你在渥太华，你也听说过 Eglinton Crosstown 和 Finch 线，但你看到了哪些与渥太华的 O-Train 的相似之处？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. We'll talk about the money a little bit later. But I want to come to you as someone who uses the transit system as an advocate, what parallels do you see with sort of I'm sure you've heard, even though you're in Ottawa, you've heard about the Eglinton Crosstown, you heard about the Finch line, but what parallels do you see with the O-Train in Ottawa?

</details>

**Gio Petti**: 嗯，有趣的是，最大的问题之一就是项目的周期。讽刺的是，如果我们回顾得更早，回到 2000 年，或者实际上是 90 年代，当时 Mike Harris 是安大略省的省长，省长，安大略省省长，抱歉，他“常识革命”的削减资金阻止了渥太华交通走廊的扩张，并填埋了当时正在挖掘的轻轨隧道，也就是我们现在终于得到的 Eglinton 轻轨。讽刺的是，这导致渥太华采用了交通系统。但这真的很令人失望。这种持续不断的，你知道，交付日期，你知道，我所说的，第一次就把工作做好的情况，就像我们看到 Finch 线那样，比公交车还慢。对于一条独立的交通线路来说，这简直是疯了，它应该比公交车快，你知道吗？而在渥太华，你知道，情况非常相似，第二条线，大约一年多前开通了。太棒了。但很多地方是单轨的，这意味着火车无法以最快的速度运行，而且载客量也比应有的要少。所以，在这两个项目中，我们都看到了在建设时本应完成的事情所带来的影响。但现在被推迟到“我们以后再修复”。

**Gio Petti**: Well, it's funny, I, I one of the, the biggest things is just the time of the projects. Ironically, if we go even further back in time to 2000 or actually the 90s, back when Mike Harris was Prime Minister of Ontario, Premier, Premier of Ontario, excuse me, his common sense revolution funding cuts were what stopped expansion of Ottawa's transitway and what originally filled in the tunnel that was being dug for the the LRT, the Eglinton LRT that was going to be built that we're finally getting now. And ironically, that's what led to Ottawa adopting a transit system. But it is really disappointing. This, this constant stream of, you know, delivery dates, you know, and what I would say, jobs not being done right the first time like we saw with the the the Finch line is slower than a bus. And that's insane for an independent transit line where it should be faster than a bus, you know. And with Ottawa, you know, very similar in a very similar vein, the line two line, which opened about a little more than a year ago now. Fantastic. But a lot of it was single tracked, so which means that the trains cannot run at the fastest speeds possible, and with a lot more capacity than it should.

</details>

**Gio Petti**: 我想在你的纪录片中问一件事，你带我们经历了一次政治、资金的历程，最后你接触到了使用公共交通的人，包括你自己。除了速度和单轨之外，你认为 O-Train 还有哪些问题？我住在渥太华郊区一个叫 Riverside South 的地方，基本上就在渥太华的边缘。多年来，这里的交通服务一直很差。我经常被告知，这是我住在 Riverside South 的错，就像，哦，你不能住在那儿还指望交通好。但随着这条火车的加入，我们看到这里可以有好的交通，但它仍然没有达到完美的水平。我经常从人们那里听到的一件事，也是我试图表达的，是因为交通服务太差了。所以很多人不得不开车出行，而不是乘坐公共交通。所以 O-Train 有一个绝佳的机会，就是将这些开车通勤的人转化为公共交通使用者。但这做得并不好。缺乏停车场。车站交通不便。所以当人们看到乘坐火车的选择时，很多人都放弃了，或者只是觉得，好吧，这不错，但对我来说开车还是更方便。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gio Petti**: And with both of these projects, we're seeing effects of things that should have been done when they were being built. But now it's being pushed to be a we're going to fix that later. One thing I do want to ask in your documentary, you kind of you, you take us through a journey of the politics behind it, the funding, but then at the end, you kind of get the the people who use transit, including yourself. And outside of the speed and the single track, what would you say are some of the issues with the O-Train?

</details>

**Gio Petti**: 所以有很多事情本可以做得更好，比如增加停车场，增加公交车到车站的连接，以及增加火车班次，以至于很多人都因此望而却步。这很不走运。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gio Petti**: Well, I live in a suburb called Riverside South, which is basically on the edge of Ottawa. For years it has been badly served by transit. I've often been told that it's my fault for living in Riverside South, that it's like, oh, you can't live there and expect transit to be good. But with the addition of this train, we've seen that we can have good transit here, but it's still not at a level where it's perfect. The thing that I hear a lot from people and where I was trying to go with that, is because transit was so badly served. So many people were led to, you know, using cars to get around rather than using public transit. So what the O-Train had the perfect opportunity to do was to convert these car commuting people into using transit. But it hasn't been done very well. There's a lack of a park and ride. There's a lack of easy access to the station. So when people see the option to take the train, a lot of people have dismissed it or just thought, okay, this is nice, but it's still easier for me to drive. So there's a lot of things that could have been done, like addition of parking, ride more connections to the stations as far as buses go, and just more frequency on the train that so many people just get turned off from it. And it's unfortunate.

</details>

**Shoshana Sachs**: Shoshana，我们再补充一点，OCTranspo 声称双轨化需要到大约 2046 年才能实现，这对于通勤者来说。我认为有巨大的承诺，有很多兴奋。然后我们看到了那种……我不想称之为代价，但这是最后的小事，就像，好吧，我们得等，你知道，好几年。请帮助我们理解，为什么像双轨化这样简单的事情需要这么长时间？你知道，当 Geo 第一次乘坐那趟火车时，可能想开得更快一点。风景优美，我敢肯定。但你知道，为什么需要这么长时间才能完成？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shoshana Sachs**: Shoshana, let's add on that OCTranspo is claiming that doubling the track will take about I think it's 2046 when it comes to transit users. I think we there's these great promise. There's a lot of excitement. And then we see the sort of I don't want to call it a price tag, but it's that little thing at the end that's just like, all right, we're going to have to wait, you know, several years. Help us understand why does it take so long for something as doubling a track that, you know, when Geo was on that train the first time, probably wanted to go a little bit faster. Lovely views, I'm sure.

</details>

**Gio Petti**: 嗯，有很多事情在进行。2046 年的日期不是建设时间，对吧？没有承诺为双轨化提供资金。没有计划。那里不是。我们将在未来 20 年里非常缓慢地进行挖掘。当你看到这样的日期时，它在我们的计划中只是象征性地表示，也许有一天会有资金。他们说的是，这目前不是我们的优先事项。当你查看数字时，不进行双轨化的决定是基于对乘客量和成本的预测。而且有些地方很难进行双轨化，因为你在 Rideau Canal 上方的桥梁上，你必须完全重建桥梁，或者你处于一个相当狭窄的沟渠中。这会涉及大量的建设。所以基本上这是一个财务选择，说这会很昂贵，而且我们认为我们没有钱或对未来乘客量的预测来调整它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gio Petti**: But, you know, why does it take so long to get that done? Well, so there's a bunch of things going on. The 2046 date isn't construction, right? There's no money committed to the doubling. There isn't a plan. It's not that there. We're going to be doing shovels really slowly for the next 20 years. When you have dates like that, it's saying fictionally in our plan to maybe one day have money. What they're saying is this isn't currently a priority for us. And when you look into the numbers, the decisions not to double the track were made based on predictions of ridership and how expensive it would be. And there are places where it can be very hard to double track, because you're on a bridge over the Rideau Canal that you would have to completely rebuild the bridge, or you're in quite a narrow trench. That would involve quite a lot of construction.

</details>

**Gio Petti**: 在关于公共交通的讨论中，经常出现的一个问题是，我们都希望我们的公共交通快速、便捷、质量极高，并且随时随地都能到达。但问题是，我们该如何支付这笔费用？我们认为谁应该支付？我们应该多贵？它应该补贴多少？政府应该承诺多少资金用于公共交通？而在 Riverside 这样的社区，出现的一个问题是，我们是否愿意建设能够服务于更高等级交通的密度？我们是否愿意优先考虑车辆在我们街道上的行驶方式，优先考虑移动最多的人，这总是通过公共交通实现的？我们是否愿意支付建设真正拥有卓越交通、真正拥有任何形式的卓越出行（包括汽车、步行、公共交通）的场所所需的税款？他们说，是的，我们愿意。我们想足够快地出行，以至于我们愿意做需要做的事情。在安大略省，则不然。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gio Petti**: And so basically it was a financial choice to say this would be expensive, and we don't think we have the money or the prediction of the future ridership to adjust for it. Something that comes up all the time in these discussions about transit is, of course, we all want our transit to be fast and convenient and super high quality and go everywhere all the time. But there's a question of, well, how do we pay for that? Who do we think should be paying? How expensive should we be? How subsidized should it be? How much money should the government commit to public transit? And one of the things that comes up, like in neighborhoods like Riverside, is are we willing to build the density that can serve higher order transit? Are we willing to prioritize how vehicles move on our street that prioritize moving the most number of people, which is always by transit? Are we willing to pay the taxes that are required to build transit places that have really excellent transit, really excellent mobility of any kind, including cars, walking, public transit? They say, yes, we do. We want to move around fast enough that we're willing to do the things that it takes. In Ontario, not so much.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的，Marco，我们来谈谈钱。为什么稳定的政府资助如此重要？我知道去年的联邦预算有一个变化，取消了每年约 30 亿美元、持续约十年的稳定资金流。现在已经改为一种更大的资金池，将用于多个项目，但请帮助我们理解，这种稳定的资金将用于什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Well, let's talk about the money there, Marco. Why is it why is stable government funding so important? I know last year's federal budget had a change that removed a steady flow of about $3 billion per year for about ten years. That's changed to sort of a bigger pot of money that would go to a number of projects, but help us understand what that stable funding would go to.

</details>

**Marco D'Angelo**: 是的，我的意思是，我们与联邦政府密切合作，在十年内获得了 300 亿美元的永久交通基金，每年提供 30 亿美元。而 11 月 4 日的预算确实让这笔金额变得不确定。这是一个问题，因为项目已经规划好，技术上已经准备就绪。而缺失的是这种稳定、长期的资金。而且我们知道，市政当局无法独自资助如此规模的项目。因此，这些是国家利益，因为它们可以减少通勤时间，减少拥堵，提高可负担性，并连接住房。因此，联邦政府重返谈判桌非常重要，我们正在与他们合作，以确保那个更大的基金涵盖更多的市政基础设施领域，我们希望确保交通能够继续拥有一个专门的资金流，以兑现联邦政府的承诺，然后这些承诺将通过各省和城市来制定十年计划，围绕来自渥太华联邦政府的资金的确定性和稳定性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Marco D'Angelo**: Yeah, I mean, we had worked very closely with the federal government to secure $30 billion over ten years in a permanent transit fund that would provide $3 billion a year. And the November 4th budget did put that amount into into doubt. And that's an issue because projects are planned, they're technically ready. And what's missing is this stable, long term funding. And we know municipalities cannot fund projects of this magnitude on their own. And so these are national interests because they reduce commute times, they reduce congestion and they improve affordability and they connect housing. So it's really important that the federal government come back to the table, and we are working with them to ensure that that larger fund that covers more areas of municipal infrastructure, we want to ensure that that transit will continue to have a very dedicated stream that will deliver on the commitments of the federal government, and then those have flowed through the provinces and cities to make ten year plans around the certainty and the stability of that funding from Ottawa, the federal government in Ottawa.

</details>

**Marco D'Angelo**: 是的。十年计划和大型项目确实很重要。我们将需要继续这样做。但我们也需要实际的一年、两年和三年计划，对吧？我不想等到我 50 岁或 60 岁才看到交通得到改善，而且我们可以通过利用现有街道来改善我们的公共交通，只要省政府目前允许。在过去一年里，省政府可能已经使公共交通和所有人的出行变得非常快速变得非法。因此，例如，我们可以做的最快、最有效的措施是为我们的城市快速移动许多人，就是建立专门的公交车道，以及在公交车非常繁忙的地方。多伦多有五个优先路线他们想做。你可以告诉我渥太华是否有他们想做的路线。如果我们有决心去做，我们可以在一年内完成。它非常便宜。你不需要联邦资金。它是一种可以通过增加乘客量来支持自身的项目。对企业有利。在每一个指标上。我们可以关注速度、金钱、空气质量。这些都是三赢的项目。但省政府却让它们变得非法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Marco D'Angelo**: Yep. Ten year plans and heavy projects are really important. We're going to need to keep doing that. But we also need practical one year, two year and three year plans, right? I don't want to wait until I'm in my 50s or 60s before I see transit improve, and there is a huge amount that we can do through how we use our existing streets to make our public transit better, as long as at the moment the provincial government will allow. The provincial government has made it potentially illegal over the last year to make public transit and just mobility for everybody really fast. So, for example, the fastest, most effective thing we could do to move many people quickly around our cities would be to make dedicated bus lanes and places where the buses are really busy. Toronto has five priority routes they want to do. You can tell me if Ottawa has routes that that they want to do.

</details>

**Marco D'Angelo**: 但其中许多事情是可以解决的，在市政管辖范围内。我的意思是，我们看到了，你知道，Bathurst 上的公交专用道曾引起争议。多伦多市政府还是推进了。所以也有信号交通信号优先。我的意思是，市政当局在工具箱里也有很多工具可以优先考虑交通而不是汽车，在安大略省的城市中。你知道，我们在滑铁卢地区一直很有创新精神，确保 Ion 列车能够获得优先权。城市本身在许多方面都能够进行改进，无论是为了自行车还是为了积极的交通，这都是一个优先事项。但确实，政府高级别需要参与进来提供资金，并且不要通过立法或其他附加条件来阻碍这些项目资金的努力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Marco D'Angelo**: We could do this in less than a year if we had the gumption to do it. It's very cheap. You don't need federal funding. It's the kind of thing that supports itself with more riders. It's good for businesses. On every metric. We could care about speed, money, air quality. These are win win win projects. But the provincial government made them illegal. But many of those many of those things are. Fixable under municipal jurisdiction. I mean, we saw, you know, Bus Lane dedicated on Bathurst that was controversial. That went ahead by City of Toronto. So there's also signal transit signal priority. I mean, there are a lot of tools that municipalities do have in their toolbox as well to to to prioritize transit over cars and cities across Ontario. You know, I have been have been innovative in doing that in the region of Waterloo in terms of making sure that the that the ion train is able to to have priority. There have been a number of things where cities on their own have been able to enhance, whether it's for, for, for bicycles or for active transportation, that that has been a priority. But it's true that that that senior levels of government need to be at the table to help fund that and also not to block efforts to to engage in that via legislation or other strings attached to project funds.

</details>

**Marco D'Angelo**: 我知道你想继续，但这并不是公共交通优先于汽车。这是为了所有人的出行。当更多人更快地移动时，对公共交通乘客和汽车司机都有好处。这真的很重要，因为我们有一种错误的观念，认为这是一场斗争，但实际上我们可以创造对任何道路使用者都更好的系统，但我们必须停止想象这是一场零和游戏。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Marco D'Angelo**: I know you want to move on, but it's not transit over cars. It's mobility for everybody. When more people move faster, it is better for transit riders and better for car drivers as well. This is really important because we have this false opinion that it's a fight, and actually we can make systems that are better for any road user, but we have to stop imagining that it's a zero sum game.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。我想让你加入进来。你知道，作为一个经常使用公共交通的人，一个被记录在案的人，一个与人交谈过的人，某种程度上。如果你能接上现在正在进行的对话。但也要为现在感到沮丧的公共交通用户提供建议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Okay. I do want to get you in here. You know, as someone who uses transit on a regular, who is documented, who has spoken to people, kind of. If you were able to pick up on this conversation that's happening right now. But also advice for for frustrated transit users right now as well.

</details>

**Gio Petti**: 嗯，关于讨论，我认为就像你说的，我认为短期计划和一两年计划很重要，因为如果我们看到最近 OC Transpo 的情况，尽管他们开通了新的火车线路，但在过去几周里，公交车方面遇到了巨大的困难。我们有了新的运营商 Troy Charter，他们基本上承认我们没有提供优质服务。我们取消了太多的班次，他们甚至实施了一项计划来争取更多的公交车，因为他们旧的车队正在报废，而且他们承诺使用电动公交车，但电动公交车的交付速度并不如预期。所以他们现在陷入了困境。我认为拥有这些短期解决方案，就像他们现在正在做的，是引进更多翻新的公交车，聘请更多机械师来修理坏掉的公交车，以确保它们对通勤者来说是可用的。我认为看到他们正在努力改进，这真的很好。但就通勤者能做什么而言，我认为我们处于一个非常有利的位置，因为渥太华今年将举行 2026 年市长选举。所以作为通勤者，你有权力说，我认为，无论是你的市议会还是市长，你可以投票选出你认为将为交通做出最好工作的人。我真的恳请那里很多人，直视镜头，就像，出去投票。如果你住在渥太华，这是一次非常重要的选举，它可能会在未来几年内决定交通系统的质量。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gio Petti**: Well, just on the discussion, I think that like as you were saying, I think short term plans and like one two year plans are important because if we've seen how OC Transpo recently, although they've opened these new train lines, they've had incredible difficulties over these past couple of weeks with buses. We had the new their new operator, Troy Charter, basically admit we are not delivering great service. We're cancelling way too many trips, and they've even implemented a plan to try to get more buses because their old fleets are breaking down and they've committed to electric buses, but the electric buses aren't shipping as fast as they should be. So they're in a rut right now. And I think having those short term solutions, as in what they're trying to do now, is getting in more refurbished buses, getting more mechanics to fix the broken buses, to make sure that they're accessible to commuters. I think that's that's, you know, really great to see that they're trying to improve. But as far as what commuters can do, I think we are in a very good position because Ottawa is having their 2026 mayoral election this year. So as a commuter, you have the power to say, I think, I think whether it be your city council or whether it be mayor, you can vote who you think is going to do the best job for transit.

</details>

**Gio Petti**: 而且交通将成为全省选举的一个议题，但肯定要考虑到 2019 年公交车的平均车龄是八年半。而今天几乎是 11 年了。所以从停运和维护成本以及不在路上运行的角度来考虑这一点。所以真的更新车队，这是一个极好极好的观点。而这正是联邦资金应该用于的。而且这可以在所引用的 1 到 2 年时间范围内发生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gio Petti**: And I really implore a lot of people out there, look straight to the camera, like, go out and vote. If you live in Ottawa, this is a very important election and it could really dictate the quality of the transit system for the next couple of years. And transit will be an election. Issue across the province, but certainly recognizing the average age of a bus in 2019 was eight and a half years old. And today it's almost 11 years old. So think about that in terms of out of service and maintenance costs and being off the road. So really renewing the fleet, that was an excellent and excellent point. And that's something that, that, that, that federal funding is meant to, to do. And that's something that can happen within that 1 to 2 year time frame that was cited.
