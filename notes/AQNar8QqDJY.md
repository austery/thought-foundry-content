title: 特朗普的报复，中东和平协议，诺贝尔奖与气候危机：一周头条新闻回顾
---
### 以色列与哈马斯达成协议，美国增派部队

From the New York Times, it's The Headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Friday, October 10th. Here's what we're covering.
这里是《纽约时报》的“头条新闻”，我是特雷西·芒福德。今天是10月10日星期五。以下是我们今天将报道的内容。

People have spent the last day in the streets celebrating news of a deal.
过去一天，人们走上街头，庆祝一项协议达成的好消息。

There are no words to describe the feeling today: spontaneous joy, excitement, tears.
今天的心情无法用言语形容：自发的喜悦、兴奋和泪水。

The agreement between Israel and Hamas calls for all the remaining Israeli hostages to be set free and could pave the way for an end to the conflict after two years of brutal war.
以色列与**哈马斯**（Hamas: 巴勒斯坦逊尼派伊斯兰政治军事组织）之间的协议要求释放所有剩余的以色列人质，并可能为这场持续两年残酷战争的结束铺平道路。

It's something that nobody thought was possible, and we're going to end up having peace in the Middle East. Who would have thought?
这是没有人认为可能发生的事情，我们最终将在中东实现和平。谁会想到呢？

President Trump, who helped broker the deal, said he'll head to the Middle East in the next few days to attend a signing of the agreement and to see the hostages returned.
特朗普总统帮助促成了这项协议，他表示将在未来几天前往中东，出席协议的签署仪式并见证人质归还。

That'll be a day of joy. I'm going to try and make a trip over. We're going to try and get over there.
那将是充满喜悦的一天。我将努力前往那里。我们都会努力去。

Still, a lot of crucial issues have yet to be resolved.
然而，许多关键问题仍有待解决。

If Hamas carries out its part of the agreement, is this the end of the war? Well, it's the implementation of the first phase.
如果哈马斯履行了协议中的部分，这是否意味着战争的结束？嗯，这只是第一阶段的实施。

We don't have any intention to renew the war, but parts of the commitment is, for example, the disarmment of Hamas.
我们无意重新开战，但承诺的一部分，例如，是哈马斯的解除武装。

But we will, we will first have a ceasefire.
但我们首先会实现停火。

In an interview on Fox News, Israel's foreign minister said some questions still need to be answered, like whether Hamas will agree to disarm, which the group has refused to do in the past.
以色列外交部长在福克斯新闻的采访中表示，有些问题仍需解答，例如哈马斯是否会同意解除武装，该组织过去曾拒绝这样做。

The initial agreement doesn't appear to have addressed that or the issue of who will control Gaza after the war ends.
初步协议似乎并未解决这个问题，也没有触及战争结束后由谁控制**加沙**（Gaza: 位于中东地中海沿岸，巴勒斯坦飞地）的问题。

In terms of next steps, the US announced it's sending 200 troops to Israel to help coordinate and monitor how the deal is implemented.
至于下一步，美国宣布将向以色列派遣200名士兵，协助协调和监督协议的执行情况。

That will include specialists in logistics and security, who will join other soldiers from Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, and the UAE.
其中包括后勤和安全专家，他们将与其他来自埃及、卡塔尔、土耳其和**阿联酋**（UAE: United Arab Emirates，阿拉伯联合酋长国）的士兵一同行动。

US officials said there's no plan to send American troops into Gaza.
美国官员表示，没有计划派遣美军进入加沙。

Meanwhile, aid organizations are also gearing up. The United Nations is preparing to rush in food, medicine, and other aid that's desperately needed in the territory, where many Gazans are facing starvation, and where basic services like medical care and clean water have been decimated.
与此同时，援助组织也在加紧准备。联合国正准备向该地区紧急运送急需的食物、药品和其他援助物资，因为许多加沙居民正面临饥饿，医疗保健和清洁饮水等基本服务已被摧毁。

For a behind-the-scenes look at how the deal between Israel and Hamas finally came together, and how President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, played a major role in that, listen to today's episode of The Daily with Times investigative reporter Mark Misetti.
要了解以色列和哈马斯之间的协议如何最终达成，以及特朗普总统的女婿贾里德·库什纳在其中扮演的关键角色，请收听今天由《纽约时报》调查记者马克·米塞蒂带来的《The Daily》节目。

### 特朗普对纽约州总检察长的政治报复

Last night, Letitia James, the attorney general of New York, was indicted on charges of bank fraud after President Trump demanded that she be prosecuted.
昨晚，纽约州总检察长**莱蒂西亚·詹姆斯**（Letitia James: 纽约州现任总检察长）在特朗普总统要求对其起诉后，被指控犯有银行欺诈罪。

It's a striking escalation of a very public, years-long conflict between the two.
这是两人之间长达数年的公开冲突的一次惊人升级。

Donald Trump may have authored "The Art of the Deal," but he perfected "The Art of the Steal."
唐纳德·特朗普或许是《交易的艺术》的作者，但他却完善了“盗窃的艺术”。

It started in 2018 when James ran for attorney general, vowing to investigate Trump's financial dealings, which have long been under scrutiny.
这始于2018年，当时詹姆斯竞选总检察长，誓言要调查特朗普的财务交易，这些交易长期以来一直受到审查。

For years, Donald Trump engaged in deceptive business practices and tremendous fraud.
多年来，唐纳德·特朗普一直从事欺骗性商业行为和巨额欺诈。

After she was elected, she quickly followed through, opening a civil investigation into the Trump Organization, and she followed it up with a sweeping lawsuit that accused Trump of fraudulently overstating his wealth.
她当选后迅速兑现承诺，对**特朗普集团**（Trump Organization: 特朗普家族拥有的房地产和投资公司）展开民事调查，并随后提起了一项全面的诉讼，指控特朗普欺诈性地虚报其财富。

It's a witch hunt. We have a corrupt attorney general in this state. You see how she does?
这是一场政治迫害。我们这个州有一个腐败的总检察长。你们看看她是怎么做的？

The scale and the scope of Donald Trump's fraud is staggering.
唐纳德·特朗普欺诈的规模和范围令人震惊。

This is a disgrace, and you're to go after this attorney general because she's attorney.
这是一种耻辱，你们要追究这位总检察长，因为她是总检察长。

From the first day of his trial, in which he was eventually found liable, Trump vowed to go after her, calling James corrupt.
从他被判有罪的审判第一天起，特朗普就誓言要追究詹姆斯，称她腐败。

Since returning to office, he's put intense pressure on prosecutors to indict her, and ultimately, federal investigators narrowed in on accusations that she falsified financial records when she purchased one of her homes.
自重返白宫以来，他一直向检察官施加巨大压力，要求起诉她，最终，联邦调查人员将重点放在她购买自己一套房屋时伪造财务记录的指控上。

James has called the charges baseless.
詹姆斯称这些指控毫无根据。

The indictment is the latest example of how Trump has shattered presidential norms by openly calling for the government to go after his political enemies.
这项起诉是特朗普如何通过公开要求政府打击其政治对手来打破总统规范的最新例证。

Along with James, his list of top targets has included former FBI Director James Comey, who pleaded not guilty this week to charges of lying to Congress.
除了詹姆斯，他的主要打击目标名单还包括前**联邦调查局**（FBI: Federal Bureau of Investigation，美国主要联邦执法机构）局长詹姆斯·科米，后者本周对向国会撒谎的指控表示不认罪。

Trump has posted on social media that they are both, quote, "guilty as hell" and that "justice must be served."
特朗普在社交媒体上发帖称，他们两人都“罪该万死”，而且“必须伸张正义”。

Notably, the indictments against James and Comey were signed by just one prosecutor, Lindseay Halligan, Trump's former personal lawyer.
值得注意的是，对詹姆斯和科米的起诉书仅由一位检察官签署，即特朗普的前私人律师林赛·哈利根。

He appointed her to the position just last month after other prosecutors raised doubts that there was enough evidence to bring the charges.
上个月，在其他检察官对是否有足够证据提出指控表示怀疑后，他才任命她担任此职。

### 委内瑞拉民主斗士荣获诺贝尔和平奖

In Oslo this morning, the Nobel Peace Prize for 2025 goes to a brave and committed champion of peace, to a woman who keeps the flame of democracy burning amidst the growing darkness.
今天早上在奥斯陆，2025年诺贝尔和平奖授予一位勇敢而坚定的和平倡导者，一位在日益增长的黑暗中保持民主火焰燃烧的女性。

The Nobel Committee announced that the winner of this year's peace prize is Maria Corina Machado, a pro-democracy politician in Venezuela.
诺贝尔委员会宣布，今年的和平奖得主是**玛丽亚·科丽娜·马查多**（Maria Corina Machado: 委内瑞拉反对派政治家），一位委内瑞拉的亲民主政治家。

She's been living in hiding for the last year after trying to rally voters against the country's longtime authoritarian leader, Nicholas Maduro.
在过去一年中，她一直过着隐居生活，此前她曾试图团结选民反对该国长期执政的独裁领导人**尼古拉斯·马杜罗**（Nicholas Maduro: 委内瑞拉现任总统）。

The committee cited her, quote, "tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy."
委员会引用了她“为委内瑞拉人民争取民主权利的不懈努力，以及她为实现从独裁到民主的公正和平过渡而进行的斗争”。

Under the Maduro regime, authorities in Venezuela have crushed protests and arrested dissidents.
在马杜罗政权下，委内瑞拉当局镇压了抗议活动并逮捕了持不同政见者。

The country's been plunged into an economic crisis, and there's been a mass exodus.
该国陷入经济危机，并出现了大规模人口外流。

In the last few years, more than 8 million people have fled the country.
在过去几年里，超过800万人逃离了该国。

In recent months, tensions between Venezuela and the US have escalated as President Trump has called Maduro's government a "narco-terror cartel," and some of Trump's top aides have discussed plans to try and force Maduro out of power.
近几个月来，委内瑞拉和美国之间的紧张关系升级，因为特朗普总统称马杜罗政府为“贩毒恐怖集团”，特朗普的一些高级助手也讨论了试图迫使马杜罗下台的计划。

### 气候变化：斯瓦尔巴群岛的警示

And finally, so this is the record we call it. It's in a storage facility.
最后，这就是我们所说的记录。它在一个储存设施里。

A team of Times reporters recently traveled to the world's northernmost settlement on a cluster of islands near the North Pole.
《纽约时报》的一组记者最近前往北极附近一个岛屿群上，那是世界上最北端的人类定居点。

It's a research station in **Svalbard**, Norway.
那是挪威**斯瓦尔巴群岛**（Svalbard: 位于北极地区的挪威群岛，以其独特的自然风光和科研价值闻名）的一个研究站。

When they let you on the ice, please stay away from the ice edge because the ice is often a bit thinner at the ice edge.
当他们允许你踏上冰面时，请远离冰缘，因为冰缘的冰通常会薄一些。

And the team spent five days talking to researchers stationed there, where the region is warming as much as seven times faster than the rest of the planet.
团队在那里与研究人员进行了五天的交流，该地区变暖的速度是地球其他地方的七倍。

That's because of a kind of feedback loop: When ice melts, it exposes dark seawater.
这是因为一种反馈循环：当冰融化时，它会暴露出深色的海水。

Dark seawater absorbs more heat, which melts more ice, and so on.
深色海水吸收更多热量，从而融化更多冰，如此循环。

The scientists say those conditions in Svalbard give them an early look at how fast and how dramatically the changing climate can change everything.
科学家们说，斯瓦尔巴群岛的这些条件让他们得以提前了解气候变化能以多快的速度和多么剧烈的方式改变一切。

You see on this ice here, there's actually very little snow. It's only in patches and a few centimeters.
你看这里的冰面上，实际上雪很少。它只是一小块一小块的，只有几厘米厚。

The scientists are looking at how changing weather patterns affect species living in that environment and how they're desperately trying to adapt to this incredibly fast-paced change.
科学家们正在研究不断变化的天气模式如何影响生活在该环境中的物种，以及它们如何拼命适应这种令人难以置信的快速变化。

So they're looking at everything from microorganisms to polar bears.
所以他们正在研究从微生物到北极熊的一切。

My colleague Sarah Herz was one of the reporters on the trip.
我的同事莎拉·赫兹是这次行程的记者之一。

She says that reindeer, for example, used to roam widely across the landscape, using frozen fjords to reach better grazing grounds.
她说，例如驯鹿过去常常在广阔的景观中漫游，利用冰冻的峡湾到达更好的牧场。

Now, with the ice melting, they've started to get cut off and stranded, and they've begun eating seaweed, which one researcher described as "survival food."
现在，随着冰层融化，它们开始被隔断和困住，并开始食用海藻，一位研究人员将其描述为“生存食物”。

The scientists have also seen how polar bears are having to adapt, which has sometimes brought the bears and humans uncomfortably close together as the polar bears have moved more inland, even raiding people's cabins in Svalbard.
科学家们还观察到北极熊如何适应，由于北极熊更多地向内陆移动，甚至袭击斯瓦尔巴群岛的人类小屋，这有时使得熊和人类之间出现了令人不安的近距离接触。

Sarah says there's now even a brochure for people who come to the remote research station about what to do if you come face to face with a polar bear.
莎拉说，现在甚至有一份小册子，为来到这个偏远研究站的人们提供了遇到北极熊时该如何做的指南。

"Stay calm. Do not run," it says. "And if the bear charges, quote, be prepared to use any possible deterrence: shovels, ski poles, rocks, blocks of ice, water in a thermos, etc."
上面写着：“保持冷静。不要奔跑。”“如果熊发起攻击，引用原文，准备使用任何可能的威慑物：铲子、滑雪杖、石头、冰块、热水瓶里的水等等。”

You can find videos and pictures of life at the Svalbard Research Station at nytimes.com.
您可以在nytimes.com上找到斯瓦尔巴研究站生活的视频和图片。

### 新闻问答：诺贝尔奖得主、世界杯门票和邦德电影

Those are the headlines, but if you would like to play the Friday news quiz, stick around.
以上是头条新闻，但如果你想玩周五新闻问答，请留下来。

It's just up after these credits. This show is made by Will Jarvis, Jessica Mezer, Yan Stewart, and me, Tracy Mumford.
它就在这些片尾字幕之后。本节目由威尔·贾维斯、杰西卡·梅泽、严·斯图尔特和我，特雷西·芒福德制作。

Original theme by Dan Powell. Special thanks to Isabella Anderson, Lissa Anderson, Jake Lucas, Zoe Murphy, Katie O'Brien, and Paula Schuman.
原创主题曲由丹·鲍威尔创作。特别感谢伊莎贝拉·安德森、莉莎·安德森、杰克·卢卡斯、佐伊·墨菲、凯蒂·奥布赖恩和葆拉·舒曼。

Now, time for the quiz. Every week, we ask you a few questions about stories the Times has been covering. Can you answer them all?
现在是问答时间。每周我们都会问你几个关于《纽约时报》报道过的故事的问题。你能全部回答出来吗？

First up, will you get the Nobel Prize? Absolutely not. They'll give it, they'll give it to some guy that didn't do a damn thing.
首先，你会获得诺贝尔奖吗？绝对不会。他们会把奖颁给那些什么都没做的人。

As mentioned, the Nobel Peace Prize was announced this morning, and despite President Trump openly campaigning for it for his role mediating international conflicts, he did not win it this year.
如前所述，诺贝尔和平奖于今天上午公布，尽管特朗普总统因其在调解国际冲突中的作用而公开争取该奖项，但他今年并未获奖。

In total, four American presidents have won it. Your question, how many can you name?
总共有四位美国总统获得过此奖。你的问题是，你能说出多少位？

Little hint, the committee only started giving out the prize in the early 1900s. So you can scratch like the first 25 presidents off the list.
一个小提示是，委员会直到20世纪初才开始颁发这个奖项。所以你可以把前25位总统从名单上划掉。

The answer, here they are: Teddy Roosevelt won in 1906 for helping end the Russo-Japanese War.
答案在这里：**西奥多·罗斯福**（Teddy Roosevelt: 第26任美国总统）于1906年因帮助结束日俄战争而获奖。

Woodrow Wilson won in 1919 for promoting world peace after World War I.
**伍德罗·威尔逊**（Woodrow Wilson: 第28任美国总统）于1919年因在第一次世界大战后促进世界和平而获奖。

Jimmy Carter won in 2002 for his decades of work promoting democracy and human rights, and Barack Obama won in 2009 for what the Nobel Prize Committee called his "extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples."
**吉米·卡特**（Jimmy Carter: 第39任美国总统）于2002年因其数十年致力于促进民主和人权的工作而获奖，**巴拉克·奥巴马**（Barack Obama: 第44任美国总统）于2009年因诺贝尔奖委员会所称的“为加强国际外交和人民间合作所做的非凡努力”而获奖。

He was less than nine months into his first term when he won. And Obama said when accepting it that he felt his, quote, "accomplishments were slight" compared to past winners.
他在上任不到九个月时就获得了该奖项。奥巴马在接受时表示，与过去的获奖者相比，他觉得自己的“成就微不足道”。

Next question. Oh my god. Okay, this is exciting. I'm definitely going to buy some more tickets.
下一个问题。哦，天哪。好的，这很令人兴奋。我肯定会再买一些票。

A bunch of tickets for a big, big, big event just went on sale this month, even though it doesn't happen until next year.
一个非常非常盛大的活动的许多门票本月刚刚开始发售，尽管它要到明年才会举行。

So, I won the lottery for the tickets. I'm starting to get a little nervous. People have been scrambling to get seats.
所以，我中了门票的彩票。我开始有点紧张了。人们一直在争抢座位。

Like, these ticket prices are crazy. If these are the prices, ladies and gentlemen, we're in trouble.
比如说，这些票价太疯狂了。如果价格是这样，女士们先生们，我们就有麻烦了。

Your question, what event has caused all of this ticket madness?
你的问题是，什么活动导致了所有这些疯狂的抢票现象？

If you need a hint, the event is set to be held in three countries: Canada, the US, and Mexico.
如果你需要提示，这项活动将在三个国家举行：加拿大、美国和墨西哥。

The answer, the 2026 FIFA World Cup. A lot of fans are not happy because **FIFA** (Fédération Internationale de Football Association: 国际足球联合会) announced that unlike with past World Cups, it's not capping the resale prices this time for tickets in the US and Canada.
答案是2026年**国际足联**（FIFA: International Federation of Association Football，国际足球联合会）世界杯。许多球迷都不高兴，因为国际足联宣布，与过去的世界杯不同，这次不再对美国和加拿大的门票转售价格设限。

Critics say that has encouraged scalpers to go wild and put the games way out of reach for a lot of fans price-wise.
批评者表示，这鼓励了黄牛肆意炒作，使得许多球迷在价格上根本无法负担观看比赛。

For example, a ticket to the final match in the way upper corner of a stadium in New Jersey jumped from about $2,000 originally to more than $25,000 just a day later on resale.
例如，一张新泽西州体育场最上层角落的决赛门票，最初价格约为2000美元，但在一天后的转售中就飙升至超过25000美元。

So basically, you're going to have to choose World Cup tickets or midsize sedan.
所以基本上，你将不得不在世界杯门票和一辆中型轿车之间做出选择。

And last question, Amazon, which earlier this year got creative control of the James Bond franchise, recently put out new artwork to showcase the films on its streaming service.
最后一个问题，亚马逊在今年早些时候获得了詹姆斯·邦德系列的创意控制权，最近发布了新的艺术作品，以在其流媒体服务上展示这些电影。

But pretty quickly, Bond fans noticed one big thing had been photoshopped out of the promo images for classics like Dr. No, GoldenEye, and Casino Royale.
但很快，邦德的粉丝们注意到，像《诺博士》、《黄金眼》和《皇家赌场》等经典电影的宣传图片中，有一件重要的东西被**Photoshop**（Photoshop: 一款图像处理软件）修掉了。

Your question. What was scrubbed out? I'll give you a little hint here.
你的问题是。什么东西被删除了？我给你一个小提示。

The answer. I mean, you can't have James Bond without guns. No.
答案是。我的意思是，没有枪就不能有詹姆斯·邦德。不。

The new images were missing Bond's gun. Fans quickly criticized Amazon for cropping out or digitally removing the weapons.
新图片中缺少了邦德的枪。粉丝们迅速批评亚马逊裁剪或数字移除武器的行为。

Sometimes I truly think streaming services are out there to ruin franchises.
有时我真的觉得流媒体服务就是为了毁掉特许经营权。

The company didn't say why it made the change, but it then reversed it after the uproar.
该公司没有说明为何做出这一改变，但在引起轩然大波后又将其撤销。

It seems to be a part of a trend in recent years in which streaming services have edited out guns, nudity, and cigarettes from posters and even from the movies themselves.
这似乎是近年来的一种趋势，流媒体服务从海报甚至电影本身中删除了枪支、裸体和香烟。

These kinds of digital tweaks aren't entirely new. For a 20th-anniversary release of E.T., Steven Spielberg swapped out federal agents' guns for walkie-talkies.
这类数字修改并非全新。在《E.T.外星人》20周年发行版中，史蒂文·斯皮尔伯格将联邦特工的枪支换成了对讲机。

He later regretted that decision and put the guns back in for the 30th anniversary.
他后来后悔了这个决定，并在30周年纪念版中将枪支放了回去。

He said he realized that movies are supposed to capture, quote, "where we were when we made them and what the world was like."
他说他意识到电影应该捕捉，“我们制作它们时的状态以及当时的世界是怎样的”。

That is it for this week's quiz. Our email, as always, is theheadlines@nytimes.com if you want to send us your score or challenge a friend, share the quiz with them, see how they do.
这就是本周问答的全部内容。一如既往，如果你想把你的分数发给我们，或者挑战朋友，和他们分享这个问答，看看他们表现如何，我们的电子邮件地址是theheadlines@nytimes.com。

We'll see if they know what Teddy Roosevelt was up to with the Russo-Japanese War. I'm Tracy Mumford. The Headlines will be back on Monday.
我们将看看他们是否知道西奥多·罗斯福在日俄战争中做了些什么。我是特雷西·芒福德。《头条新闻》将于周一回归。
