### 2025年诺贝尔经济学奖：人类经济增长之谜

大家好，欢迎收看夸克说。我是夸克。本期节目我们将探讨今年的**诺贝尔经济学奖**（Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences: 瑞典皇家科学院颁发的经济学奖项），以及从中可以解读出的对包括中国在内的众多经济现象的解释。相信我，看完这期节目，尤其是后半部分的论述，有可能会颠覆一些你此前深信不疑的观念。废话不多说，我们马上开始。

<p class="english-text">Hello everyone, welcome to Quark Says. I am Quark. In this episode, we will talk about this year's Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences and the explanations it offers for numerous economic phenomena, including those in China. Believe me, after watching this episode, especially the latter half of the discussion, some of your previously deeply held beliefs might be overturned. Without further ado, let's begin.</p>
</details>

2025年的诺贝尔经济学奖颁给了三位经济学家。为了方便大家记忆，我们分别称这三位为老乔、菲利普和彼得。其中老乔是一拨，菲利普和彼得是一拨。他们三人共同研究了一个困扰人类的重大且古老的问题：为什么人类历史上大多数时间经济都停滞不前，而**工业革命**（Industrial Revolution: 18世纪后期至19世纪初，以机器生产取代手工劳动为标志的社会经济变革）后，人类世界的**GDP**（Gross Domestic Product: 国内生产总值，衡量一个国家或地区经济活动总量的指标）却能持续增长，生活水平也水涨船高？

<details>

<p class="english-text">The 2025 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded to three economists. For ease of memory, we will refer to these three as Old Qiao, Philip, and Peter. Old Qiao is one group, and Philip and Peter are another. Together, they researched a major and old problem that has puzzled humanity: why did the economy stagnate for most of human history, while after the Industrial Revolution, the world's GDP has continuously grown, and living standards have risen?</p>
</details>

工业革命以前的人其实是不会提出这种问题的。道理很简单，在那长达数千年的时间里，人类的**生产力**（Productivity: 单位时间内生产的产出量）、财富积累和**人均GDP**（GDP per capita: 人均国内生产总值，衡量平均生活水平的指标）长期都是停滞不前的。那个年代，大家对于财富的理解还是**零和博弈**（Zero-sum game: 参与者一方的收益必然意味着另一方的损失）思维。例如，北宋熙宁元年，**王安石**和**司马光**就曾在宋神宗面前进行过一次辩论。王安石认为理财是当务之急，因为朝廷财政吃紧，而他可以做到“民不加富而国用足”，即不用增加老百姓的负担也能增加财政收入。而反方司马光则说：“你这是大忽悠！天下的产出是固定的，财富不在民就在官，政府有钱了那不就等于折腾老百姓吗？”应该说，在那个年代，司马光的看法还是有道理的。后来王安石变法搞得天怒人怨也侧面印证了这一点。我们今天经常谈增量思维，但这个增量思维的前提是“增”；如果“增”都不“增”，生产力一直停留在同一个水平，那确实就只能零和博弈了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">People before the Industrial Revolution wouldn't have asked such questions. The reason is simple: for thousands of years, human productivity, wealth accumulation, and per capita GDP were stagnant. In that era, the understanding of wealth was still a zero-sum game mentality. For example, in the first year of Xining in the Northern Song Dynasty, Wang Anshi and Sima Guang once debated in front of Emperor Shenzong. Wang Anshi believed that financial management was an urgent priority because the imperial treasury was tight, and he could achieve "the people are not enriched, but the state's expenditure is sufficient," meaning he could increase fiscal revenue without burdening the common people. On the other hand, Sima Guang said, "You are a great deceiver! The world's output is fixed; wealth is either with the people or with the officials. If the government has money, doesn't that mean tormenting the common people?" It should be said that in that era, Sima Guang's view was reasonable. The later failure of Wang Anshi's reforms, which caused widespread resentment, also indirectly confirmed this point. Today, we often talk about incremental thinking, but the premise of this incremental thinking is "growth"; if there is no growth and productivity remains at the same level, then it can indeed only be a zero-sum game.</p>
</details>

关于工业革命以来财富增长的秘密，此前的很多学者都提出过不同的观点，并由此产生了许多流派。而我们今天提到的这三位——老乔、菲利普和彼得，他们也是靠对这个问题的解释拿的奖。以下我简单介绍一下。

<p class="english-text">Regarding the secret of wealth growth since the Industrial Revolution, many scholars have previously put forward different views, leading to various schools of thought. The three economists we are discussing today—Old Qiao, Philip, and Peter—also won their award by explaining this very problem. I will briefly introduce their work below.</p>
</details>

### 老乔的洞察：从随机试错到系统性创新

先说老乔。他是一位经济历史学家，在研究14到18世纪英国和瑞典海量的经济数据后发现，这几百年间两国的经济发展几乎停滞。虽然偶尔会有些小发明出来，但社会的整体财富基本是原地踏步，没什么变化，直到1760年工业革命以后才突飞猛进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's start with Old Qiao. He is an economic historian who, after studying massive economic data from England and Sweden between the 14th and 18th centuries, found that economic development in both countries was almost stagnant during these centuries. Although occasional small inventions emerged, the overall wealth of society largely remained static, with little change, until the Industrial Revolution in 1760, after which it advanced by leaps and bounds.</p>
</details>

这里稍微补充一点，就是财富的定义是什么？图中是**维基百科**（Wikipedia: 一个自由内容、公开编辑且多语言的网络百科全书）上的说法，我稍微念一下：财富包括自然财富、物质财富、精神财富。这里我们主要聊物质财富，指的是所有具有货币价值、交换价值或者经济效用的财产或者资源，包括货币、不动产、所有权等等，有时还包括对基础服务的享受，比如医疗卫生，对农作物、家畜的拥有权。你可能注意到了，整个社会的财富总量是和生产力有关的。比如说，这有一万亩荒地，你要是自己种自己耕，可能你们一家也就能种十亩，一年可能也就收4000公斤小麦，其他的9000多亩你都得荒着，对吧？可你要用现代化的农业机械呢？可能两三个人就搞定了，产量是原来的1000倍。相应的，社会总财富和你自己的总财富是不是就比原来多了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here, I'll briefly add: what is the definition of wealth? The image shows the definition from Wikipedia, which I'll read out: wealth includes natural wealth, material wealth, and spiritual wealth. Here, we mainly discuss material wealth, which refers to all property or resources that have monetary value, exchange value, or economic utility, including currency, real estate, ownership, etc., and sometimes also includes the enjoyment of basic services like healthcare, and ownership of crops and livestock. You might have noticed that the total wealth of society is related to productivity. For example, if there are ten thousand acres of wasteland, and you cultivate it yourself, your family might only be able to cultivate ten acres, harvesting perhaps 4,000 kilograms of wheat per year, leaving the other nine thousand-plus acres fallow, right? But what if you use modern agricultural machinery? Perhaps two or three people could manage it, and the yield would be 1,000 times the original. Correspondingly, wouldn't the total wealth of society and your own total wealth be greater than before?</p>
</details>

同理，因为你产出粮食的平均成本下来了，那市场上的相对粮价是不是就更便宜了？比如原来一个剪头发的Tony哥一天的工资能买20斤大米，可能现在能买100斤了。那相对而言，他的个人财富是不是也增加了？因为同样的工作时长，他现在能买到更多物资了。这就是过去200年在世界各地发生的财富增长的奇迹。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Similarly, because your average cost of producing grain has decreased, wouldn't the relative price of grain in the market become cheaper? For example, a hairdresser named Tony, whose daily wage used to buy 20 catties of rice, might now be able to buy 100 catties. Relatively speaking, hasn't his personal wealth also increased? Because for the same working hours, he can now buy more goods. This is the miracle of wealth growth that has occurred worldwide over the past 200 years.</p>
</details>

这种异乎寻常的财富增长在老乔看来是源于创新方式发生的变化，也就是从原来的随机试错变成了系统性推进。这里稍微解释一下，老乔首先将知识分成了两类：一类是**命题知识**（Propositional knowledge: 关于“为什么”和“怎么回事”的知识，如科学定律），也就是为什么和怎么回事，比如常见的物理定律和化学生物学知识等等；第二类是**规范知识**（Prescriptive knowledge: 关于“该怎么做”的使用技巧，如技术），也就是该怎么做的使用技巧，比如铁匠该怎么打铁、怎么造纸。我们可以粗略地将前者理解成科学，后者理解为技术。工业革命以前，这两者是分开的。更具体地说，主要是前者不够发达，也就是搞技术发明的人一直存在，但那些系统性、抽象的、可重复验证的科学理论还没发展起来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">According to Old Qiao, this extraordinary wealth growth stemmed from a change in the mode of innovation, transitioning from random trial-and-error to systematic advancement. To elaborate, Old Qiao first categorized knowledge into two types: one is propositional knowledge, which addresses "why" and "how things work," such as common physical laws and chemical-biological knowledge; the second type is prescriptive knowledge, which pertains to "how to do things," such as how a blacksmith forges iron or how to make paper. We can roughly understand the former as science and the latter as technology. Before the Industrial Revolution, these two were separate. More specifically, the former was underdeveloped; that is, people engaged in technical invention always existed, but systematic, abstract, and verifiable scientific theories had not yet developed.</p>
</details>

结果就是，搞发明的人完全是靠经验瞎猜、随机试错，既没法改进也很容易失传。举个例子，假设你天赋异禀，发现烧水的时候水蒸气会把壶盖给顶开，于是自己搞了个简易蒸汽机。那接下来你如果想继续改进它，就面临一个问题：你需要懂一些最基本的**力学**（Mechanics: 研究物体运动和受力关系的物理学分支）、**热力学**（Thermodynamics: 研究热能与其他形式能量之间转换关系的物理学分支）知识，了解温度、气压、输出的动力之间的数学关系。但假如你生活的这个时代没有热力学，没发明温度计，甚至连**牛顿三定律**（Newton's three laws of motion: 经典力学的三大基本定律）都没出现呢？那就意味着你没法精确计算、明确改进方向，只能凭经验一遍遍试错，跟瞎摸碰死耗子的概率差不多。同时，因为你不懂里面的科学原理，即便搞成了，你也没法把这个设计思路传授给其他人。一旦你死了，或者原始图纸失传，后来人也很难复刻你的发明。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The result was that inventors relied entirely on empirical guesswork and random trial-and-error, making it difficult to improve their creations and easy for them to be lost. For example, suppose you are exceptionally gifted and discover that steam pushes open a kettle lid when water boils, leading you to build a simple steam engine. If you then want to improve it, you face a problem: you need to understand some basic knowledge of mechanics and thermodynamics, knowing the mathematical relationships between temperature, pressure, and output power. But what if you live in an era without thermodynamics, without thermometers, or even before Newton's three laws of motion were discovered? That would mean you couldn't precisely calculate or define directions for improvement; you could only rely on experience, repeatedly trying and failing, much like blindly stumbling upon a dead mouse. At the same time, because you don't understand the underlying scientific principles, even if you succeed, you can't pass on this design idea to others. Once you die, or the original blueprints are lost, it would be very difficult for future generations to replicate your invention.</p>
</details>

工业革命之前，包括中国在内的世界各国大量发明都是昙花一现，最终失传。其中最重要的原因就是缺少理论知识。因为只要有了成体系的理论，有了精确的测量工具，哪怕原始的图纸丢了，后来人只要知道功能和原理，早晚也能复刻或者重新发明出来，并且一代代持续改进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Before the Industrial Revolution, a large number of inventions in various countries, including China, were fleeting and eventually lost. The most important reason for this was the lack of theoretical knowledge. Because once there is a systematic theory and precise measuring tools, even if the original blueprints are lost, future generations, as long as they know the function and principle, will eventually be able to replicate or reinvent it, and continuously improve it generation after generation.</p>
</details>

### 创新落地：制度与环境的不可或缺

以上说的还只是科技部分。而一个创新想要落地，还需要完善的配套环境。咱们以**达芬奇**（Leonardo da Vinci: 文艺复兴时期意大利的博学者，以其艺术和科学发明闻名）为例，早在15世纪他就已经画出了飞机和直升机的图纸。当然，这会儿还没有出现**空气动力学**（Aerodynamics: 研究空气运动及其与物体相互作用的科学），但就算他懂空气动力学，设计出来了也造不出飞机。为什么？你有适合现代飞机的航空材料吗？有动力足够强劲的航空发动机吗？有燃油吗？有橡胶轮胎吗？都没有。你会发现，以上任何一个配件背后其实都是一整套庞大的工业生产体系，不可能一蹴而就。除此以外，你可能还需要投资人，需要成熟的、能够变现的**商业模式**（Business model: 描述企业如何创造、传递和获取价值的框架），用户对于该产品的接受度。缺任何一样，你的飞机都搞不出来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The above only covers the technological aspect. For an innovation to be realized, it also requires a complete supporting environment. Let's take Leonardo da Vinci as an example; as early as the 15th century, he had already drawn blueprints for airplanes and helicopters. Of course, at that time, aerodynamics had not yet emerged, but even if he understood aerodynamics and designed them, he still couldn't build an airplane. Why? Do you have suitable aerospace materials for modern aircraft? Do you have powerful enough aero-engines? Do you have fuel? Do you have rubber tires? None of these. You'll find that behind any of these components is actually a vast industrial production system, which cannot be built overnight. In addition, you might need investors, a mature and monetizable business model, and user acceptance of the product. Lacking any of these, your airplane cannot be made.</p>
</details>

上面这些还只是硬件方面的配套环境，更重要的还在于软件环境。设想一下，假设生活在几百年前的你突然有了一项了不起的发明，比如说电报吧。过去通信都是靠驿站，600里加急也得半个月，再快一点信鸽也得好几天。但有了电报，你这一发送，那边就收到了，效率提升杠杠的，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The above are just the hardware-related supporting environments; more importantly, there's the software environment. Imagine that you, living several centuries ago, suddenly had a remarkable invention, say, the telegraph. In the past, communication relied on post stations, where even a 600-li urgent message would take half a month, and carrier pigeons would still take several days. But with the telegraph, you send it, and the other side receives it instantly, a significant improvement in efficiency, right?</p>
</details>

但这是不是就意味着你可以靠这项发明发家致富、走上人生巅峰呢？得看情况。假如你生活在一个文明法治的社会，有成熟的**专利**（Patent: 保护发明创造的独占权利）法保护**私有产权**（Private property rights: 个人或实体对其财产拥有排他性控制和使用的权利），并且有成熟的**金融体系**（Financial system: 促进资金流动和分配的机构、市场和工具网络）、投融资环境和商业氛围，那就没问题。你可以先注册专利，拿了这项专利你就可以找到银行贷款或者找风险投资。由于在专利保护期内这是独门生意，谁侵权了你都可以告他，会有很多人抢着借钱或者投钱给你。然后你就能靠着这笔钱创建自己的研发部门，搭建生产线，提高良品率，同时雇一大批销售去推销你的产品。一开始你的电报机可能会卖得很贵，因为成本很高嘛。但慢慢的，你能够大规模生产了，价格也打下来了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But does this mean you can get rich and reach the pinnacle of your life with this invention? It depends on the circumstances. If you live in a civilized and law-abiding society with mature patent laws protecting private property rights, and a mature financial system, investment and financing environment, and business atmosphere, then there's no problem. You can first register a patent, and with this patent, you can get a bank loan or seek venture capital. Since this is an exclusive business during the patent protection period, you can sue anyone who infringes, and many people will rush to lend or invest money in you. Then, with this money, you can establish your R&D department, set up production lines, improve yield rates, and hire a large sales force to promote your product. Initially, your telegraph machine might sell for a high price because the cost is high. But gradually, as you achieve mass production, the price will come down.</p>
</details>

但与此同时，你的销量和市场占有率也火速攀升，你赚得盆满钵满。有这些钱，你就能开始研发新品了，比如电话甚至是可视电话。但反过来，如果你生活在一个很糟糕的社会，以上那几条都没有呢？会发生什么？首先没有专利保护法，也就意味着一旦你的产品面世，很快就能有人复制，所以你只能动作快点，争取在别人反应过来以前占领市场。同时因为金融体系很落后，你只能去庙里借钱，因为没有专利又没有资产抵押，你又不是政府官员，大概率借不到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At the same time, your sales and market share will rapidly climb, and you'll be raking in profits. With this money, you can start developing new products, such as telephones or even video phones. But conversely, what if you live in a very poor society where none of the above conditions exist? What would happen? First, without patent protection laws, it means that once your product hits the market, someone can quickly copy it, so you can only act fast to capture the market before others react. At the same time, because the financial system is very backward, you can only borrow money from temples, and since you have no patent and no asset collateral, and you are not a government official, you are unlikely to get a loan.</p>
</details>

有人给你介绍了一个富豪。在你介绍完自己的发明以后，对方毫不犹豫地拒绝你。他说：“你这玩意是挺好的，但你没有任何背景。假设我投钱给你，东西造出来了，你有能力搞定政府采购吗？要知道你这玩意一上市会触动多少人利益，造成多少人失业？这中间的关系盘根错节，人家不弄死你就不错了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Someone introduces you to a wealthy individual. After you present your invention, they refuse you without hesitation. They say, "Your invention is indeed good, but you have no connections. Suppose I invest money in you, and the product is made, can you handle government procurement? You must know how many people's interests this thing will affect and how many people it will put out of work once it hits the market. The relationships involved are complex; it would be good if they don't kill you."</p>
</details>

再者说，就算整个社会慢慢接受你的发明，但那个钱能到你腰包里吗？工部尚书的儿子有个商号就是专做邮政生意的，信不信你的电报一上市，他立马就能挖你的人过去，搞出仿品？然后人家能搞定政府采购，有钱建厂，跟你打价格战。你卖50两，人家卖40。最后他随便打个招呼，衙门的捕快就上门了，随便给你安个偷税漏税之类的罪名，抄家流放那是轻的。最终富豪没有投你，但你还是不信邪，愣是找亲戚朋友凑钱把公司干起来了。结果刚卖了五部电报机，你就在市面上看到了同类产品，是之前那个富豪和尚书家的公子的买卖。你气不过想去找对方理论，结果刚到门口就看到一个告示，说经内阁开会讨论，觉得电报这玩意太危险，容易泄露国家机密，属于关乎国家安全、国际民生的重大行业。即日起电报业只能国营，尚书儿子去了新建的国家电报公司当老总，而你的厂子则直接收归国有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Furthermore, even if society slowly accepts your invention, will that money end up in your pocket? The son of the Minister of Works has a business specializing in postal services. Believe it or not, the moment your telegraph hits the market, he can immediately poach your people and create a counterfeit product. Then, they can secure government procurement, have money to build factories, and wage a price war against you. You sell for 50 taels, they sell for 40. Finally, with a simple word from them, the yamen constables will come to your door, arbitrarily accuse you of tax evasion or similar crimes, and confiscation and exile would be getting off lightly. In the end, the wealthy individual didn't invest in you, but you were still unconvinced and managed to raise money from relatives and friends to start your company. As a result, after selling just five telegraph machines, you saw similar products on the market, sold by that wealthy individual and the Minister's son. You were furious and wanted to confront them, but as soon as you arrived at their doorstep, you saw a notice stating that after cabinet discussions, it was deemed that the telegraph was too dangerous, prone to leaking state secrets, and belonged to a major industry concerning national security and international livelihood. Effective immediately, the telegraph industry could only be state-owned, the Minister's son became the general manager of the newly established national telegraph company, and your factory was directly nationalized.</p>
</details>

了解了以上这些，你就明白了，创新从来就不是靠着一个或者几个天才发明家的灵光乍现，它背后依赖的是现代科学、工程学和配套的法律、金融、商业环境。而这一切的背后，归根结底还是制度。你所在的社会必须得是个相对自由开放的环境。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Understanding all of this, you realize that innovation is never merely the flash of genius from one or a few brilliant inventors; it relies on modern science, engineering, and a supportive legal, financial, and business environment. And behind all of this, ultimately, are institutions. The society you are in must be a relatively free and open environment.</p>
</details>

### 熊比特的创造性破坏：财富增长的魔法师

以上大概就是老乔的主要观点了，没什么出奇的，对吧？别着急，因为今年的经济学奖最精彩的部分还在后面。这两位菲利普和彼得，我在之前的一期节目里曾经简单提到过奥地利经济学家**熊比特**（Joseph Schumpeter: 20世纪重要的经济学家，提出“创造性破坏”理论）的**创造性破坏**（Creative destruction: 资本主义经济中，旧的产业和生产方式不断被新的取代，从而实现经济增长的动态过程）理论。这里可以稍微多说两句。简单说，就是熊比特认为**资本主义**（Capitalism: 一种经济和社会制度，其特点是生产资料私有制和以利润为目的的生产）能够持续创造财富的根本性动力在于创造性破坏，也就是企业家们会不停地创新，研发出更好的产品和服务。在这个过程中，他们会打破现有的平衡，也就是在创造新的更好的同时破坏旧的落后的。而在他暂时领先对手这段时间，就能获得垄断带来的超额利润。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's roughly Old Qiao's main point, nothing too surprising, right? Don't rush, because the most exciting part of this year's economics prize is yet to come. I briefly mentioned the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter's theory of creative destruction in a previous episode when discussing Philip and Peter. Here, I can elaborate a bit more. Simply put, Schumpeter believed that the fundamental driving force for capitalism's continuous wealth creation lies in creative destruction. That is, entrepreneurs constantly innovate, developing better products and services. In this process, they disrupt existing balances, creating new and better things while destroying old and outdated ones. During the period they temporarily lead their competitors, they can obtain excess profits from their monopoly.</p>
</details>

创造性破坏理论是1912年提出的，当时在学界产生了极大的震撼。一个重要的原因就是它相当于从根本上“刨了”**马克思**（Karl Marx: 19世纪德国哲学家、经济学家，共产主义理论的奠基人）的祖坟。我们都知道，**马主义**（Marxism: 马克思主义，以马克思和恩格斯思想为基础的哲学、社会、政治和经济理论）最核心的理论是**剩余价值**（Surplus value: 马克思主义经济学概念，指工人创造的、超出其工资价值的那部分价值），就是他认为资本家是不劳而获，没有任何贡献的。社会财富百分之百是由工人的劳动创造，而且跟劳动时间挂钩，劳动时间越长，创造财富就越多。鉴于资本家几乎不怎么劳动，就相当于没有创造价值，你拿的那部分就是压榨工人得来的剩余价值。这个理论错得多么惨绝人寰，这里就不多说了，以后有机会单做一期。总之，马克思认为创造财富的唯一源泉是工人们的劳动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The theory of creative destruction was proposed in 1912 and caused a tremendous shock in academia at the time. A significant reason for this was that it fundamentally challenged the core tenets of Karl Marx. As we all know, the most central theory of Marxism is surplus value, which posits that capitalists gain without labor and make no contribution. Social wealth is 100% created by the labor of workers and is linked to working hours; the longer the working hours, the more wealth is created. Given that capitalists hardly labor, they essentially create no value, and the portion they take is surplus value extracted from exploiting workers. How terribly wrong this theory is, I won't elaborate here; perhaps in a future episode. In short, Marx believed that the sole source of wealth creation was the labor of workers.</p>
</details>

而熊比特则跟他唱了个反调。按照老熊的理论，创造财富，尤其是工业革命以来社会总财富爆发式的增长，根源不在于工人的劳动，而在于企业家的创新。打个比方，马克思觉得资本主义就是个榨汁机，是靠压榨工人发展起来的。而熊比特觉得资本主义更像是个魔法师，在不停创造新的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Schumpeter, however, sang a different tune. According to Old Schumpeter's theory, the root of wealth creation, especially the explosive growth of total social wealth since the Industrial Revolution, lies not in the labor of workers but in the innovation of entrepreneurs. To illustrate, Marx believed capitalism was a juicer that developed by exploiting workers, while Schumpeter saw capitalism more as a magician constantly creating new things.</p>
</details>

那两者究竟哪个更接近事实呢？其实很好判断。根据荷兰格罗宁根大学著名经济史学家**安格斯·麦迪逊**（Angus Maddison: 英国经济史学家，以其对世界经济增长和发展历史的量化研究而闻名）的研究，从1750年到现在200多年间，人类每年创造的财富总额大概增加了300多倍，而人口只增加了10倍左右。推算下来，人均GDP增加了大约29倍。但今天工人们的平均工作时长总不可能是1750年的29倍吧？相反，现代人还有了8小时工作制、双休和各种节假日，工作时间只会比那会儿更短。这说明什么？说明生产效率提高了。那生产效率提高得益于什么？得益于发明创新和改进管理方式，而这些绝大多数时候都是企业家而不是工人发明的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, which of the two is closer to the truth? It's actually easy to judge. According to the research of Angus Maddison, a renowned economic historian from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, over the past 200-plus years, from 1750 to the present, the total amount of wealth created by humanity annually has increased by about 300 times, while the population has only increased by about 10 times. This translates to an approximate 29-fold increase in per capita GDP. But surely, the average working hours of today's workers cannot be 29 times that of 1750, can they? On the contrary, modern people have an 8-hour workday, weekends, and various holidays, meaning working hours are only shorter than they were then. What does this indicate? It indicates that production efficiency has increased. And what is this increased production efficiency due to? It's due to inventions, innovations, and improved management methods, which, in the vast majority of cases, are invented by entrepreneurs, not by workers.</p>
</details>

有人可能要抬杠说：“你凭什么说发明创造都是企业家的功劳？无产阶级就没有那个聪明才智吗？你这是傲慢污蔑。”其实原因很简单，前面咱们论证过了，在一个保护专利和私有产权、金融体系成熟的社会，一旦某人搞出了一个天才的发明，那即便他原来是工人，也大概率会华丽转身变成老板、股东或者公司合伙人，而不再仅仅是打工人了。因为市场会奖励并且兑现他的这部分贡献。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some might argue, "Why do you claim that all inventions and creations are the credit of entrepreneurs? Don't the proletariat possess such intelligence and talent? This is arrogant slander." The reason is actually very simple: as we've demonstrated earlier, in a society that protects patents and private property rights and has a mature financial system, once someone comes up with a brilliant invention, even if they were originally a worker, they would very likely transform into an owner, shareholder, or company partner, rather than just a wage earner. This is because the market rewards and monetizes their contribution.</p>

而只有在什么情况下，工人的发明创新才得不到奖励和承认，发明完了依然还拿那么点工资呢？社会主义国家的国企。因为它不保护专利和私有产权嘛，你有任何发明创造都是所谓的“集体贡献”，领导指挥有方。也就是说，在创造性破坏理论的框架下，企业家们不仅不是寄生虫，反而是创造财富最主要的源泉。至于老马和老熊的理论哪个更对，我相信这200年的现实已经很说明问题了。

<p class="english-text">And under what circumstances do workers' inventions and innovations not get rewarded or recognized, leaving them with the same meager wages after inventing? In state-owned enterprises in socialist countries. Because they don't protect patents and private property rights, any invention or creation you make is considered a "collective contribution," with leadership providing effective guidance. In other words, within the framework of creative destruction theory, entrepreneurs are not parasites; on the contrary, they are the primary source of wealth creation. As for which theory, Marx's or Schumpeter's, is more accurate, I believe the reality of the past 200 years has largely answered that question.</p>

### 菲利普与彼得的模型：量化创新与垄断的新视角

说完了熊比特，咱们再看看今年的菲利普和彼得。他们给老熊的创造性破坏理论发展出了可以精确测量的数学模型。简单说，之前老熊的观点是创新型破坏会带来繁荣和经济增长，但这个过程到底是怎么发生的，他没有展开讲。因为新的发明，比如蒸汽机的出现，也会毁掉原来的马车业，导致一大批人失业，对吧？你怎么证明这一增一减能够获得正向收益呢？虽然从直觉上讲我们知道火车取代马车、轮船取代木船应该是好事，但这个过程还需要论证清楚。

<p class="english-text">Having discussed Schumpeter, let's now turn to Philip and Peter this year. They developed a mathematically measurable model for Schumpeter's theory of creative destruction. Simply put, Schumpeter's earlier view was that innovative destruction leads to prosperity and economic growth, but he didn't elaborate on how this process actually occurs. Because new inventions, such as the steam engine, also destroy the existing horse-carriage industry, leading to a large number of job losses, right? How do you prove that this increase and decrease result in a net positive gain? Although intuitively we know that trains replacing horse carriages and steamships replacing wooden boats should be a good thing, this process still needs to be clearly demonstrated.</p>

而这两位老兄干的事就是补足了这块拼图，并且把一个困扰大家多年的问题，也就是**垄断**（Monopoly: 某种产品或服务的唯一提供者，缺乏竞争）给讲清楚了。需要说明的是，他俩的原始论文论证过程很复杂，用到了**微分方程**（Differential equations: 涉及未知函数及其导数的数学方程），要原原本本列出来估计大部分观众直接就气了。以下我做了一些简化处理，尽量用初中以内的数学知识把这个过程讲清楚，保证您秒懂。

<details>

<p class="english-text">What these two gentlemen did was complete this puzzle and clarify a long-standing problem that has bothered many: monopoly. It's worth noting that the original papers' argumentation process is very complex, involving differential equations, and listing it out verbatim would likely frustrate most viewers. Below, I've made some simplifications, trying to explain the process using mathematics no more advanced than junior high level, ensuring you grasp it instantly.</p>
</details>

首先，你可以将经济设想成一条条产品线，各自生产着不同的产品。比如这条线是造手机的，那条是造飞机的。然后每条产品线都有一个领头羊的公司，拥有业界最先进的技术。咱们以电脑**CPU**（Central Processing Unit: 中央处理器，电脑的核心组件）这个赛道为例，市场上有两个主要玩家：**英特尔**（Intel）和**AMD**。英特尔是领头羊，技术更领先，而AMD处于追赶的位置。假设英特尔目前最好的产品**质量**（Product quality: 产品满足用户需求和期望的程度）是Q，AMD想通过创新升级超过英特尔，做出质量为EQ的产品。这里的E大于1，比如说是1.5吧，意思就是做出质量比英特尔目前最好的产品还好50%的CPU。一旦AMD达成这个目标，就等于实现了一次创造性破坏。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First, you can imagine the economy as a series of product lines, each producing different products. For example, one line makes mobile phones, another makes airplanes. Each product line then has a leading company with the industry's most advanced technology. Let's take the computer CPU sector as an example; there are two main players in the market: Intel and AMD. Intel is the leader with more advanced technology, while AMD is in a catching-up position. Suppose Intel's current best product quality is Q, and AMD wants to surpass Intel through innovative upgrades, creating a product with quality EQ. Here, E is greater than 1, say 1.5, meaning creating a CPU that is 50% better in quality than Intel's current best product. Once AMD achieves this goal, it amounts to an act of creative destruction.</p>
</details>

那AMD实现这个目标的可能性我们管它叫Z，也叫**破坏率**（Disruption rate: 现有领先技术被新创新取代的可能性）。比如Z等于20%，就是一年之内它有20%的概率能够超过英特尔，做出质量为EQ的产品。那么有哪些因素共同决定了这个破坏率呢？菲利普和彼得给出了这样一个计算公式：Z等于X乘以W除以Q。其中X是**研发经费**（R&D expenditure: 研发投入的资金），W是**研发效率**（R&D efficiency: 研发投入转化为创新成果的效率），Q前面说了是产品质量。也就是说，在研发经费和效率一定的情况下，英特尔目前的产品质量越好，通过破坏式创新超过它的概率就越低。反过来，其他条件相同的情况下，你投入的研发费用X越高，超过它的概率就越高。需要说明的是，这个破坏率Z不一定来自于竞争对手，也可以是公司内部的下一代产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The probability of AMD achieving this goal is what we call Z, also known as the disruption rate. For example, if Z equals 20%, it means there's a 20% chance within a year that it can surpass Intel and produce a product with quality EQ. So, what factors collectively determine this disruption rate? Philip and Peter provided the following formula: Z equals X multiplied by W, divided by Q. Here, X is the R&D expenditure, W is the R&D efficiency, and Q, as mentioned before, is product quality. This means that, given constant R&D expenditure and efficiency, the better Intel's current product quality, the lower the probability of surpassing it through disruptive innovation. Conversely, with other conditions being equal, the higher your R&D expenditure X, the higher the probability of surpassing it. It should be noted that this disruption rate Z does not necessarily come from a competitor; it can also be the company's own next-generation product.</p>
</details>

了解了上面这几个概念，咱们再来看看怎么计算一下公司的价值。他们给出的公式是V=L/(R+Z)。其中V是这家公司的**市值**（Market capitalization: 公司所有股票的市场总价值），L是公司这一年的**净利润**（Net profit: 公司在扣除所有成本、费用和税收后的最终盈利），R是当前央行的**基准利率**（Benchmark interest rate: 央行设定的利率，作为其他利率的参考）或者**国债利率**（Treasury bond interest rate: 政府发行债券的利率，通常被视为无风险利率）。Z还是上面提到的破坏率。大学期间选修过经济学同学可能都知道，给一家公司估值的时候，有时候会用到一个公式就是V等于L除以R。没选修过也没关系，很简单。假设英特尔今年的净利润为100亿美金，美国的国债利率为5%，那英特尔市值就是100除以5%等于2000亿美金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Having understood the above concepts, let's look at how to calculate a company's value. The formula they provided is V=L/(R+Z). Here, V is the company's market capitalization, L is the company's net profit for the year, R is the current central bank's benchmark interest rate or the treasury bond interest rate. Z is still the disruption rate mentioned above. Students who took economics in college might know that when valuing a company, a formula sometimes used is V equals L divided by R. If you haven't taken it, it's simple. Suppose Intel's net profit this year is 10 billion USD, and the US treasury bond interest rate is 5%, then Intel's market capitalization would be 100 divided by 5%, which equals 200 billion USD.</p>
</details>

它的逻辑是这样的：假设你有2000亿美金，全都买了美国国债，那每年的利息收入就是100亿。而英特尔每年的利润也是100亿。这说明英特尔这家公司合2000亿美金的存款等值。但你可能注意到了，这个算法稍微有点问题，那就是风险不同。通常来说，美国国债的风险几乎等于0，也就是你这个利息收益非常稳定。但英特尔就不同了，它属于高科技产业，随时可能被竞争对手取代，也就是破坏。今年赚了100亿，明年可能就亏损甚至倒闭了。所以你还得考虑个风险问题。于是这两位老兄调整了一下，给这个公式的分母增加了一个Z。我们假定Z等于20%，也就是一年之内英特尔有五分之一的概率会被AMD翻盘，失去领先地位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The logic is as follows: suppose you have 200 billion USD and you invest all of it in US treasury bonds, then your annual interest income would be 10 billion USD. Intel's annual profit is also 10 billion USD. This suggests that Intel, as a company, is equivalent to 200 billion USD in deposits. However, you might have noticed that this calculation has a slight problem: the difference in risk. Typically, the risk of US treasury bonds is almost zero, meaning your interest income is very stable. But Intel is different; it belongs to a high-tech industry and could be replaced, or disrupted, by a competitor at any time. It might earn 10 billion this year and then incur losses or even go bankrupt next year. So, you also need to consider the risk factor. Thus, these two gentlemen adjusted the formula by adding a Z to the denominator. We assume Z equals 20%, meaning there's a one-fifth probability that Intel could be overturned by AMD within a year, losing its leading position.</p>
</details>

考虑这个因素，你再算一次：V等于100亿除以（5%加20%）等于400亿美金，只有原来的五分之一了。所以你明白了，如果一家公司随时可能被竞争对手超越，那它的估值会大打折扣。但反过来，假如这家公司处于垄断地位，Z接近于0，又或者它自己就是创新方面的领跑者，只有它取代别人，人家很难取代它，比如**特斯拉**（Tesla）这种，会有另外一套计算方法，这里就不详述了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Considering this factor, calculate again: V equals 10 billion divided by (5% plus 20%), which equals 40 billion USD, only one-fifth of the original. So you understand that if a company can be surpassed by competitors at any time, its valuation will be significantly discounted. Conversely, if a company holds a monopoly position, with Z close to 0, or if it is itself a leader in innovation, only it replaces others, and others find it difficult to replace it, like Tesla, there would be a different set of calculation methods, which I won't detail here.</p>
</details>

### 垄断的悖论：创新驱动与社会财富增长

结果就是，作为企业家的你，为了保持公司更值钱，自己的财富不至于缩水，就得持续加大研发投入，尽可能确保是你先搞出创新，破坏别人，而不是竞争对手来破坏你。一个典型的例子就是这两年**AI**（Artificial Intelligence: 人工智能）的异军突起。在**OpenAI**出现以前，**Google**、**微软**（Microsoft）、**Meta**都是各自赛道里的垄断企业，毫无争议的老大。结果其他**GPT**（Generative Pre-trained Transformer: 一种基于深度学习的语言模型）横空出世，差点给这几家掀翻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The result is that, as an entrepreneur, to keep your company more valuable and prevent your wealth from shrinking, you must continuously increase R&D investment, ensuring as much as possible that you are the one who innovates and disrupts others, rather than competitors disrupting you. A classic example is the sudden rise of AI in recent years. Before OpenAI emerged, Google, Microsoft, and Meta were undisputed leaders, monopoly enterprises in their respective fields. Then, other GPT models burst onto the scene, nearly overturning these giants.</p>
</details>

这也是为什么**苹果公司**（Apple Inc.）已经这么强了，还是得不停地研发新品，确保每代的**iPhone**性能都会有一定幅度提升的原因。因为如果你原地踏步，用户就可能转头选择更好的安卓机，比如**三星**（Samsung）。那为什么这个破坏式创新的过程能够增加社会的财富总量呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is also why Apple, despite being so powerful, must continuously develop new products, ensuring that each generation of iPhone has a certain degree of performance improvement. Because if you stand still, users might turn to better Android phones, like Samsung. So, why does this process of disruptive innovation increase the total wealth of society?</p>
</details>

我举两个最容易理解的例子。以苹果手机为例，2007年iPhone横空出世，几年内就把当时的行业霸主**诺基亚**（Nokia）和**摩托罗拉**（Motorola）给干趴下了。这事大家都知道啊。那它是怎么做到的呢？当时的诺基亚旗舰价格在550美元左右。然后苹果推出了初代iPhone，用户们一上手发现各方面体验秒杀诺基亚，感觉简直就不像是一个时代的东西。现在问题来了，假设回到那个年代让你选，你会愿意为这部体验好得多的iPhone付多少钱呢？反正如果是我的话，价格比诺基亚高两三倍，比如1500美金，我是可以接受的。那它实际的定价是多少呢？499美元，比诺基亚还便宜！你要是消费者，是不是觉得超值啊？这里我们引入一个概念，叫**消费者剩余**（Consumer surplus: 消费者愿意支付的最高价格与实际支付价格之间的差额），也就是消费者愿意为某个产品支付的最高价格减去实际支付价格之间的差额。通俗地说，就是你买东西时占的便宜。它可以用来衡量技术进步所带来的幸福感提升。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'll give two easy-to-understand examples. Take the Apple iPhone as an example: in 2007, the iPhone burst onto the scene and within a few years, it brought down the then-industry giants Nokia and Motorola. Everyone knows this. So, how did it do it? At that time, Nokia's flagship phone was priced around 550 USD. Then Apple launched the first-generation iPhone, and users immediately found its experience far superior to Nokia's, feeling like it belonged to a completely different era. Now, the question is, if you were transported back to that era and asked to choose, how much would you be willing to pay for this much better iPhone? Personally, I would accept a price two or three times higher than Nokia's, say 1500 USD. But what was its actual price? 499 USD, even cheaper than Nokia! As a consumer, wouldn't you feel it was an incredible value? Here, we introduce a concept called consumer surplus, which is the difference between the maximum price a consumer is willing to pay for a product and the actual price they pay. In layman's terms, it's the bargain you get when buying something. It can be used to measure the increase in happiness brought about by technological progress.</p>
</details>

类似的情况在另一个案例里可能更加明显。假定你是一个古代进京赶考的举子，按以前的法子你得坐马车，路上走三个月，全程花费50两银子。现在有人发明了一种东西叫火车，进京用不了三个月，几个小时就到了。这张票卖你多少钱你能接受？可能卖你500两你都觉得值，因为它不仅快还安全，能避开路上车匪路霸什么的，而且相当于延长你的生命，来回路上这半年你干点啥不好是吧？但实际情况是，高铁车票的实际售价才5两，相当于你用原来十分之一的价格买到了比原来快几百倍的服务，是不是瞬间觉得幸福感拉满啊？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A similar situation might be even more evident in another case. Suppose you are an ancient scholar traveling to the capital for imperial examinations. By old methods, you would have to take a horse carriage, traveling for three months, costing 50 taels of silver for the entire journey. Now, someone invents something called a train, and you can reach the capital in just a few hours, not three months. How much would you be willing to pay for this ticket? You might find it worth 500 taels, because it's not only fast but also safe, avoiding highway bandits and such, and it's equivalent to extending your life—what couldn't you do with that half-year saved on travel, right? But in reality, a high-speed rail ticket costs only 5 taels, meaning you get a service hundreds of times faster than before for one-tenth of the original price. Doesn't that instantly fill you with a sense of happiness?</p>
</details>

有人可能会说：“技术进步带来幸福感提升这个我认，但财富总量还是没变，无非是从张三转到李四手里了。比如苹果是赚到钱了，但诺基亚不是倒了吗？火车公司是起来了，但马车夫们集体失业了。虽然也增加了一些火车司机、乘务员之类的新工种，但减少的工作岗位肯定比增加多，因为马车时代一个马车夫对应一个乘客，而火车可能是一个乘务员服务30个乘客，工作岗位明显变少了。你怎么证明财富在增加呢？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some might argue, "I agree that technological progress brings an increase in happiness, but the total wealth hasn't changed; it's merely transferred from one person to another. For example, Apple made money, but didn't Nokia collapse? The train company rose, but the coachmen collectively lost their jobs. Although some new jobs like train drivers and attendants were created, the number of jobs lost must be greater than those gained, because in the horse carriage era, one coachman served one passenger, while a train attendant might serve 30 passengers, so jobs are clearly fewer. How do you prove that wealth is increasing?"</p>
</details>

但上面这个算法其实是有问题的，是静态的算法。实际情况是，技术进步带来的是全社会经济运转效率的提高。比如在马车时代，因为出行成本过高，除非进京赶考这种大事，95%的普通人可能一辈子都没机会出门。这导致整个出行市场的规模就很小，提供的岗位也很有限。而火车出现以后，大幅度降低了出行门槛，大家就不仅仅是赶考才出行了，平时也能出去旅行、探亲访友、移居到其他地方。人均年出行次数可能增加了一千倍。这种情况下，它提供的就业岗位可能反而比以前多得多。这个其实很好理解，您就琢磨，在汽车出现以前，城市内的短途出行得靠坐轿子吧？一个官员上朝得四个轿夫。那你说是乾隆时期的轿夫人数多，还是今天的出租车、网约车司机人数多？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, the above calculation is actually problematic; it's a static calculation. The reality is that technological progress leads to an increase in the overall efficiency of economic operations. For example, in the horse carriage era, due to excessively high travel costs, 95% of ordinary people might never have had the chance to leave home unless it was for a major event like traveling to the capital for imperial examinations. This resulted in a very small overall travel market and limited job opportunities. After the advent of trains, the barrier to travel was significantly lowered, and people no longer traveled only for examinations; they could also go on trips, visit relatives and friends, and move to other places. The average annual number of trips might have increased a thousandfold. In this situation, the number of jobs it provides might actually be much greater than before. This is actually easy to understand: just consider, before the advent of cars, short-distance travel within cities relied on sedan chairs, right? An official going to court required four sedan chair bearers. So, would you say there were more sedan chair bearers during the Qianlong era, or more taxi and ride-hailing drivers today?</p>
</details>

并且，出行效率的提高不仅提供了乘务员这种工作岗位，还大幅提高了人员流动频率。而这种人员流动会带来大量的商业机会，比如旅游、餐饮、住宿、跨区域贸易和商务合作等等。这些产业链上自然而然就会产生很多就业岗位和经济增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Furthermore, the improvement in travel efficiency not only created jobs like attendants but also significantly increased the frequency of people movement. This movement of people brings about a large number of business opportunities, such as tourism, dining, accommodation, cross-regional trade, and business cooperation. These industrial chains naturally generate many job opportunities and economic growth.</p>
</details>

这么说可能还是在抽象，我举个具体的例子。比如说苹果，它每代的iPhone都比上一代贵那么一点，上一代1000美金，这一代就卖1100，价格提升了10%，但性能可能提升了30%。你综合一比较，还是划算，于是就买了。表面上看起来每次换手机的花费都比以前更多，似乎吃亏了。但您别忘了，您的消费就是别人的收入。您花的越多，苹果公司的收入和利润就越高，苹果员工的收入也越高。这些人会带动更多的消费，最后可能你的收入也增加了。结果算下来，你买下一代的iPhone可能反而更容易了。当然，在这个过程中，整个社会会产生一定程度的通胀，但扣除这个因素，经济还是增长的，你的实际收入和幸福感也还在增加。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This might still be abstract, so let me give a concrete example. Take Apple, for instance: each generation of iPhone is a little more expensive than the last. If the previous generation was 1000 USD, this generation sells for 1100, a 10% price increase, but performance might have improved by 30%. When you compare them overall, it's still a good deal, so you buy it. On the surface, it seems like each time you upgrade your phone, you spend more than before, seemingly at a loss. But don't forget, your consumption is someone else's income. The more you spend, the higher Apple's revenue and profit, and the higher Apple employees' incomes. These people will drive more consumption, and eventually, your income might also increase. As a result, you might find it easier to buy the next generation iPhone. Of course, during this process, society will experience a certain degree of inflation, but even after accounting for this factor, the economy is still growing, and your real income and sense of happiness are still increasing.</p>
</details>

不信你想一下，2007年的初代iPhone卖500美金，现在是1000美金，价格涨差不多两倍。但这将近20年下来，iPhone的性能提升多少？社会平均工资又涨多少？买一个iPhone是不是更容易了？关于这个**经济增长率**（Economic growth rate: 衡量一个国家或地区经济产出随时间增长的速度）的算法，菲利普和彼得搞出了一个计算公式叫G等于Z乘以**自然对数**（Natural logarithm: 以常数e为底的对数）E。其中G是每年的经济增长率，Z是前面提到的破坏率，E还是前面说过的质量提升的倍数。这里我们可以代入稍微计算一下，假设某个国家Z等于10%，你可以理解为每年全社会有10%的落后产能被替换。E等于1.3，也就是全社会产品的平均质量是去年的1.3倍。自然对数1.3等于0.262，乘以10%就是2.62%。这就是该国的年经济增长率。根据这个公式我们可以得出，要想提高经济增长率，也就是G，关键在于Z和E，也就是创新破坏率越高，每次的质量提升幅度越大，经济增长也就越快。

<details>

<p class="english-text">If you don't believe me, consider this: the original iPhone in 2007 sold for 500 USD, and now it's 1000 USD, roughly doubling in price. But over these nearly 20 years, how much has the iPhone's performance improved? How much has the average social wage increased? Isn't it easier to buy an iPhone now? Regarding the calculation of the economic growth rate, Philip and Peter developed a formula: G equals Z multiplied by the natural logarithm of E. Here, G is the annual economic growth rate, Z is the disruption rate mentioned earlier, and E is still the multiple of quality improvement discussed previously. We can plug in some numbers to calculate: suppose a country has Z equal to 10%, which you can understand as 10% of outdated capacity being replaced annually across society. E equals 1.3, meaning the average quality of products across society is 1.3 times that of the previous year. The natural logarithm of 1.3 is 0.262, multiplying by 10% gives 2.62%. This is the country's annual economic growth rate. From this formula, we can conclude that to increase the economic growth rate, G, the key lies in Z and E; that is, the higher the innovation disruption rate and the greater the magnitude of quality improvement each time, the faster the economic growth.</p>
</details>

### 经济增长的公式与垄断的类型

但根据前面的公式Z=X*W/Q，X=Z*Q/W。在研发效率W和Z不变的情况下，研发投入的资金X是和产品质量Q成正比的，也就是技术越先进，想要更上一层楼，需要投入的研发资金就越高。举个例子，**台积电**（TSMC: 台湾积体电路制造股份有限公司，全球最大的专业集成电路制造服务公司）从7纳米工艺提升到5纳米可能需要投入100亿的研发资金，但从5纳米提升到3纳米，可能就要投入300亿。同时我们也知道，一个企业的研发投入是和公司利润相关的，多数情况下你不可能保持利润才一个亿，结果研发投了100个亿，这也不健康，对吧？所以要确保持续创新，Z足够高，你就得让企业保持足够高的利润。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, according to the previous formula Z=X*W/Q, which implies X=Z*Q/W. With R&D efficiency W and disruption rate Z constant, R&D investment X is directly proportional to product quality Q. This means the more advanced the technology, the higher the R&D funds required to reach the next level. For example, TSMC might need to invest 10 billion in R&D to upgrade from 7-nanometer to 5-nanometer process, but from 5-nanometer to 3-nanometer, it might require 30 billion. At the same time, we also know that a company's R&D investment is related to its profit; in most cases, you cannot maintain a profit of only 100 million while investing 10 billion in R&D—that's unhealthy, right? Therefore, to ensure continuous innovation and a sufficiently high Z, you must allow companies to maintain sufficiently high profits.</p>
</details>

那企业怎么才能获得高利润呢？在技术上保持领先优势，垄断。所以你发现了吗？菲利普和彼得的理论给我们提供了一种看待企业垄断的全新视角。过去我们通常认为垄断企业是邪恶的、有害的，所以各国才会纷纷出台反垄断法嘛。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So how can companies achieve high profits? By maintaining a leading technological advantage, a monopoly. Do you see now? Philip and Peter's theory offers us a completely new perspective on corporate monopolies. In the past, we generally believed that monopolies were evil and harmful, which is why countries have successively introduced anti-monopoly laws.</p>
</details>

但这两位老兄告诉我们，这个看法可能是错的。什么意思呢？我们假定一家企业完全不垄断，也没有任何领先同行的技术，那他就无法获得高于行业平均水平的利润，说白了不赚钱。而不赚钱就意味着他没有能力增加研发投入，对整个社会的创新也没有任何贡献。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But these two gentlemen tell us that this view might be wrong. What does that mean? Let's assume a company has no monopoly whatsoever and no technology superior to its peers; then it cannot earn profits above the industry average—in short, it doesn't make money. And not making money means it has no ability to increase R&D investment, making no contribution to overall social innovation.</p>
</details>

这就是为什么专利和版权保护如此重要的原因。你想一下，一家药企十年投入了100亿研发出了一款能够治疗心脏病的药物，结果刚一问世就被其他药企给仿冒了，售价只有你的十分之一。还有些无良企业不仅仿冒，还把药粉掺进中药里高价出售，宣传这是“纯天然老祖宗的智慧”。长此以往，还有谁乐意投钱搞研发呢？直接抄就行了呀！

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is why patent and copyright protection are so important. Imagine a pharmaceutical company that invests 10 billion over ten years to develop a drug that can treat heart disease. The moment it's released, other pharmaceutical companies counterfeit it, selling it for only one-tenth of your price. Some unscrupulous companies not only counterfeit but also mix the drug powder into traditional Chinese medicine, selling it at a high price and promoting it as "pure natural ancestral wisdom." If this continues, who would be willing to invest money in R&D? They could just copy it!</p>
</details>

但反过来，如果一家企业永远保持垄断也不行。因为如果你的地位完全无法撼动，躺着就能赚大钱，那你就没有动力搞研发、搞创新，技术也就停滞了。所以最好的企业应该是自由竞争下的适度阶段性垄断，也就是每次你搞出了破坏式创新，社会应该通过制度安排保证你在一定期限内享受这个垄断利润。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Conversely, if a company maintains a monopoly forever, that's also not good. Because if your position is completely unshakeable and you can make big money effortlessly, then you have no incentive to engage in R&D or innovation, and technology will stagnate. Therefore, the best scenario for a company is a moderate, phased monopoly under free competition. This means that each time you achieve disruptive innovation, society should, through institutional arrangements, guarantee that you enjoy this monopoly profit for a certain period.</p>
</details>

你有了一定的利润，又担心竞争对手会超过你，就会努力搞研发，争取在下个阶段继续保持领先，赚取新的垄断利润。在这个过程中，没有哪个企业能够一直垄断，破坏式创新始终存在，技术也会持续进步。这也是我们一开始探讨的工业革命以来人类社会财富呈指数级增长的动力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">With a certain level of profit, and fearing that competitors might surpass you, you will strive to invest in R&D, aiming to maintain your lead in the next phase and earn new monopoly profits. In this process, no single enterprise can maintain a monopoly indefinitely; disruptive innovation always exists, and technology continues to advance. This is also the driving force behind the exponential growth of human social wealth since the Industrial Revolution, which we discussed at the beginning.</p>
</details>

当然，以上说的是自由竞争出来的垄断企业，比如**微软**（Microsoft）、**谷歌**（Google）这种。但非自由竞争环境下的垄断企业，比如不是靠技术创新而是靠公权力或是暴力维持、禁止竞争对手进入该行业的垄断企业，比如**中石油**（PetroChina）、**中石化**（Sinopec）、**中国烟草**（China Tobacco），包括一些国家的贩毒集团等等，就很糟糕了。那基本都属于社会毒瘤。
