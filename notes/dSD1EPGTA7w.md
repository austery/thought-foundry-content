### 每日回顾：市场动态与个人思考

大家好，欢迎回到本频道，我们又带来了一期每日回顾节目。希望大家度过了一个愉快的感恩节。说实话，过去几天我完全没有考虑市场，甚至可以说什么都没想。这是我很久以来最长的四天假期，没有直播也没有制作视频。所以，我认为这次休息是必要的，我花了一些时间陪伴家人。希望大家也享受了假期。正如你们所见，我的胡子还在继续生长，我真的长了白头发。我不知道该怎么形容这种感觉，我才28岁，不知道这是否是长白发的年纪。我也不知道是不是市场让我老了，但我不会因为长了白头发就刮掉胡子。不过，它确实很明显，非常显眼，就像圣诞老人一样。

<p class="english-text">Hey everybody, welcome back to the channel. We are back on another episode of the daily recap. I hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving. You know, I legitimately did not think about the markets and quite frankly anything over the past couple days. It's the longest 4-day break that I've had from even streaming or making videos in a while. And so, uh, I think it was a need a refresher. Spent some time with family. Hopefully, you guys got to enjoy. As you can see, the beard is continuing to grow out. I legit have gray hair. Like, I like I don't even know how to feel about it. I'm 28. I don't know if that's the age you're supposed to get gray hair. I don't know if the market has aged me. I'm not going to shave my beard just cuz I have gray hair. But it's like it's obvious. It's very visible. It's like freaking Santa Claus. Like [laughter] this is I told you guys I'm becoming an you guys say I'm still young. I'm getting older. But lot to talk about today.</p>
</details>

我告诉过你们我正在变老，你们说我仍然年轻，但我确实在变老。今天有很多事情要谈。黄仁勋（**Jensen Huang**: 英伟达CEO）终于回应了谷歌的**TPU**（Tensor Processing Units: 谷歌开发的专用人工智能加速器）与英伟达（Nvidia）之间的问题。所以我们将深入探讨人工智能领域正在发生的事情以及黄仁勋的看法。消费者状况方面，零售公司如科尔士（Kohl's）、百思买（Best Buy）、阿伯克龙比（Abercrombie）等发布了非常好的财报，过去两天我们得到的“黑色星期五”分析数据也显示消费者表现相当强劲。所以，我们将详细讨论这些。然后是加密货币，加密货币到底发生了什么？日本出现了一些问题。我知道人们可能听说过**日元套利交易**（Yen Carry Trade: 借入低利率日元投资高收益资产的策略）。我们今天需要再次讨论它，因为它正在影响加密货币市场，坦率地说，它也可能影响股市。让我们开始吧。

<p class="english-text">I told you guys I'm becoming an you guys say I'm still young. I'm getting older. But lot to talk about today. Jensen finally addressing the issues with Google's TPUs versus Nvidia. So we'll get into what's going on in the world of AI and what Jensen had to say. uh state of the consumer, lots of new updates in regards to the retailer companies, Kohl's, Best Buy, Abocram, etc. that have put up some really good earnings and the Black Friday analytics that we got over the past two days are looking pretty strong for the consumer. So, we'll talk more about that. Uh and then crypto, what the hell is happening in crypto? Got some issues with Japan. I know people have heard about the yen carry trade. We're going to have to talk about it again today because it's affecting the crypto markets and quite frankly, it might affect the stock market. Let's get into it.</p>

### 英伟达的投资与对谷歌的回应

好的，让我们从英伟达开始。今天黄仁勋发布了一个重要公告，向Synopsis投资了20亿美元。说实话，我对这家公司了解不多。然而，它在半导体制造的芯片设计方面是更重要的公司之一。他们是**EDA**（Electronic Design Automation: 电子设计自动化软件）的领先供应商。基本上，它对于设计和验证复杂芯片及系统的集成电路至关重要。英伟达投入了20亿美元，当天股价上涨了7%。英伟达为什么要投资？嗯，他们有很多现金，需要将这些现金投入使用。因此，黄仁勋继续对Synopsis进行了另一项投资。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, let's get started with Nvidia. Uh, big announcement today from Jensen, $2 billion investment into Synopsis. Going to be honest, I don't know everything about that company. However, it is one of the more important companies when it comes to semiconductor manufacturing for chip design. They're a leading provider of electronic design automation, which is EDA software. Uh, basically, it's essential for designing and verifying integrated circuits for the creation of complex chips and systems. Nvidia put in two billion. and the stock was up 7% on the day. Why did Nvidia invest? Well, uh they've got a lot of cash. They need to put that cash to use. And as a result, Jensen continued to make another investment into Nvidia or into synopsis.</p>
</details>

在我们讨论他关于谷歌和TPU的言论之前，快速提一下，因为我知道那是更受关注的评论。今天很多人再次谈论“循环融资”的论点，但对我来说，这真的没什么道理。黄仁勋就对Synopsis的投资发表评论说，Synopsis正在帮助设计非常复杂的芯片系统架构。英伟达是一家芯片公司。所以，英伟达当然会受益于像Synopsis这样的公司采购英伟达的服务并购买芯片。但**CUDA**（Compute Unified Device Architecture: 英伟达开发的并行计算平台和编程模型）也有其非常特殊之处，有人会认为它是英伟达的软件模式，而Synopsis与此独特地交织在一起。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Real quick before we get into what he said about Google and the TPUs because I know that's the more interesting comment here. A lot of people once again today are talking about this circular financing argument and again it really just doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Jensen made [clears throat] a comment on the investment in Synopsis by saying Synopsis is helping design the architecture of very complex chip systems. Nvidia is a chip company. So yes, will Nvidia benefit from uh a company like Synopsis procuring the services from Nvidia and buying chips? Of course, but there's also something very very special to CUDA, which is one would argue Nvidia software mode that synopsis is uniquely intertwined in. </p>
</details>

所以，如果Synopsis有实际的业务，而不仅仅是向英伟达购买或出售产品，那么英伟达向他们提供20亿美元并参与其股价上涨的收益，以及Synopsis可能从英伟达购买产品，从而帮助英伟达的营收增长，这对我来说并不构成循环。Anthropic和OpenAI的情况也是如此。如果这些公司有实际的商业模式，即使它们获得了像英伟达这样的投资，或者像英特尔（Intel）那样获得了英伟达50亿美元（现在是80亿美元，所以黄仁勋在这笔投资上上涨了70%）的投资，如果它们在投资方之外的其他方面也能赚钱，并且投资方（在本例中是英伟达）能够通过股价升值获得收益，那就不算是循环。那是英伟达投资了一家碰巧是其客户的公司，但这家公司向世界提供产品和服务，从而增加了自己的收益，然后英伟达分享了该公司实际收益增长带来的股价升值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the idea that Nvidia is giving them $2 billion and participating in the upside of their stock going up and Synopsis potentially buying products from Nvidia, which also helps Nvidia's revenue growth being circular to me doesn't make a lot of sense if Synopsis has an actual business outside of just buying from Nvidia, selling to Nvidia, which is where the sort of circular loop comes in. Same thing with Enthropic, same thing with OpenAI. If these companies have actual business models, even if they get an investment from an Nvidia like an Intel, which got a $5 billion investment from from Nvidia, which is now eight billion, so Jensen's up 70% on that. If they make money on other things outside of the investment from the investor and the entity that that that is creating the the the share price appreciation aka in this case Nvidia and that's not circular. That's Nvidia making an investment in a company that happens to be a client but that company going out providing products and services to the world and then increasing their earnings and then Nvidia sharing the upside of the price appreciation if the company is able to use that investment to grow their actual earnings.</p>
</details>

所以我真的不认为这是循环的。我认为“循环”的论点有点老套了。迈克尔·伯里（**Michael Burry**: 知名投资者）又发布了几篇Substack文章。我认为他最新的文章是关于英伟达的股权激励是看跌的。我的意思是，越来越多的论点被抛出来。说实话，我晚上抱着我的英伟达股票睡得像个婴儿。我的意思是，上周我真的思考了谷歌TPU这件事，我还在做更多的研究，但我不认为这是什么大问题。我真的不这么认为。上周谷歌DeepMind的研究人员说，市场抛售英伟达是愚蠢的，而他正是帮助设计TPU的人。而且，我们即将讨论的整体AI数据中心市场仍在持续巨大增长。这让我觉得，即使谷歌能够抢占一些市场份额，英伟达以25倍的市盈率进行交易，并且第四季度营收可能超过650亿美元，这仍然是愚蠢的。我认为市场最终会认识到这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I really don't think this is circular. I think the circular argument is starting to be a bit stale. Uh you've got Michael Bur putting out more substacks. I think his latest substack now was about Nvidia stockbased compensation being bearish. I mean, it's just more and more arguments that are being thrown out there. Genuinely, I am starting to sleep like a baby at night holding my Nvidia. I mean, last week I really thought about this TPU Google thing and I'm still doing more research on it, but I don't think it's a big deal. Like, I really don't. You had the Google Deep Mind research guy last week say the market selling off Nvidia is stupid and he's a guy who helps design TPUs. And then you have the growth of the overall AI data center market that we're about to talk about continuing to just be tremendous. Which makes me think even if Google was able to take some market share, Nvidia training at 25 times earnings with a quarter that they're likely going to beat on $65 billion in revenue in Q4 is stupid. And I think eventually the market will catch up to that. Catch up to that as well.</p>
</details>

以下是黄仁勋今天对谷歌的评价：

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's what Jensen said about Google today.</p>
</details>

“听着，我们与**ASICs**（Application-Specific Integrated Circuits: 专用集成电路）竞争已经很久了，谷歌也拥有ASICs很长时间了。英伟达就是英伟达，他们做得非常出色，正如你们所知，我一直都对此赞不绝口。英伟达所做的更具通用性，我们的技术更具可互换性。请注意今天的公告：加速Synopsis的设计工具，包括EDA、SDA、CAE工具，需要像CUDA这样的计算机架构。这在ASICs上是不可用的。因此，英伟达能够应对更广泛的市场，而不仅仅是聊天机器人。我们无处不在，我们存在于每一个云平台，每一个OEM厂商，我们有本地部署，也在边缘计算领域。因此，英伟达的机会要大得多。你们现在看到的是一个真实、具体的例子，展示了我们平台能够实现而其他任何人都无法实现的机会。所以这对我们来说是一个非常大的机会，一个巨大的机会，可以重塑Synopsis以及整个行业的EDA、设计和工程领域，也是我们增长的机会，因为这需要大量的计算。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, listen, we've been uh we've been competing with AS6 now for quite a long time and Google has A6 for a long time. Nvidia's Nvidia and they did a great job as you know and I've always been complimentary >> always. >> What NVIDIA does is much more versatile. Our technology is much more funible. Notice the announcement today. Accelerating synopsis design tools, the EDA, the SDA, the CAE tools requires a computer architecture like CUDA. It's not available for AS6. And so NVIDIA can address markets that are much much broader, not just chatbots. We are also everywhere. We're in every cloud. We're in every single OEM. We're on prem and we're also at the edge. And so the NVIDIA opportunity is much much larger. And you're now seeing a real tangible experience example of an opportunity that we could do with our platform that nobody else can. And so this is a very big opportunity for us, huge opportunity to reinvent the EDA industry, the design and engineering industry for Synopsis and the rest of the industry and a growth opportunity for us because this is so computationally intensive.</p>
</details>

所以黄仁勋的回应相当不错。他对谷歌表示尊重，祝贺他们取得成功，但他表示谷歌拥有ASICs已经很久了，而英伟达所做的更具通用性。我们无处不在，我们存在于每一个云平台。英伟达的机会要大得多。我认为黄仁勋基本上是在争辩说，是的，这些TPU很棒，是的，我们很高兴谷歌成功了，但这并不是英伟达的末日，那些说这是英伟达末日的人有点言之过早。摩根士丹利今天也发布了一份报告，称他们预测如果谷歌在未来两年内销售大约1200万个TPU，这将是他们估计的620万个的两倍。每50万个TPU可以为谷歌在2027年单独增加130亿美元的收入和每股40美分的收益。这看涨谷歌，而不是看跌英伟达。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So pretty nice response from Jensen. He uh you know respectful to Google congratulates them on the on their success but he says Google's had them for a long time when he's talking about them he means A6 and what Nvidia does is much more versatile. We are everywhere. We are in every cloud. The Nvidia opportunity is just much larger. I think Jensen's basically making the argument that yes these TPUs are awesome and yes we're happy that Google is successful but this is not the death of Nvidia and people saying it's the death of Nvidia is a bit premature. Morgan Stanley put out a report today as well saying that they forecast if Google sells approximately 12 million TPUs over the next two years, which would be double their estimate of 6.2 million. Every 500,000 TPUs could add 13 billion in revenue and 40 cents to Google earnings per share in 2027 alone. Bullish, very bullish Google, not bearish Nvidia.</p>
</details>

所以我今天没有再买英伟达股票。它短暂下跌了一点，然后反弹，收盘价在179美元左右。我上次购买是在170美元。如果跌破170美元，我将继续买入。我不知道今年的“圣诞老人行情”是否一定会发生。我们将更多地讨论宏观经济正在发生的事情，但如果它确实发生，或者我们获得任何程度的广泛市场动能，标普500指数距离7000点还有2.5%。顺便说一句，自1950年以来，75%的时间里，标普500指数在12月份平均上涨1.5%。所以也许这次也会发生。然后我认为英伟达可能会更接近190美元的年度高点。如果出现广泛的市场反弹，甚至可能更高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I didn't buy more Nvidia today. It dipped for a little bit and then it kind of rebounded, closed at around 179. Uh last time I bought was at 170. If we go below 170, I will be buying more. I don't know if the Santa Claus rally is necessarily going to happen this year. We'll talk more about what's going on in the macro, but if it does happen or, you know, we get any level of broad-based market momentum, two and a half% away from the S&P 500 getting to 7,000, which by the way, since 1950, 75% of the time, the S&P 500 has averaged a 1.5% move in the month of December. So maybe that happens this time as well. Then I think Nvidia probably is closer to that 190 range standout of the year. Maybe even higher if we're able to have a broad-based rally.</p>
</details>

关于英伟达的最后一件事，我看到了摩根士丹利（Morgan Stanley）的这份报告，我觉得也非常有趣。所以，摩根士丹利对Alphabet及其TPU非常看好，但他们再次表示：“我们不看跌英伟达。我们继续认为英伟达将保持主导市场份额，因为威胁被夸大了，尽管我们不确定什么会扭转市场情绪。我们基于行业联系的信念是，英伟达将为大多数应用提供最佳经济效益，这是坚定不移的。”我认为最重要的一句话是：“公司未来12个月最大的担忧是他们能否获得足够的英伟达产品，特别是**Vera Rubin**（英伟达下一代GPU架构）。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Last thing on Nvidia right here, I saw this note from Morgan Stanley that I thought was also very interesting. So again, they Morgan Stanley super bullish on Alphabet and their TPUs, but once again, they said, "We're not bearish Nvidia. We continue to see Nvidia maintaining dominant market shares as threats are becoming overstated, though we aren't exactly sure what will turn sentiment around. Our belief informed by industry contracts is that Nvidia will have the best economics for most applications, and that is unwavering. And here's the sentence that I thought was the most important. company's biggest anxiety for the next 12 months is their ability to procure enough Nvidia product generally and Vera Rubin specifically."</p>
</details>

所以市场说这都是泡沫，而摩根士丹利则表示，我们与之交谈的客户最关心的问题是，他们担心没有足够的芯片，或者他们无法排队获得最新的芯片，而不是芯片过多或数据中心过多的泡沫。因此，我认为从这个角度来看，我们将每天在节目中继续关注这一点，因为数据正在引导我得出这个结论。我正在努力保持非常客观，如果我对英伟达的投资不好，我会希望在其他人之前知道，这样我就可以卖掉它，对吧？我正在努力非常客观地说，这到底是真实的还是不真实的？根据我们正在查看的所有数据，根据我正在查看的数字，它看起来非常非常真实。因此，它似乎不会去任何地方。英伟达似乎将继续增长并保持这一势头。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you've got the market saying that this is all a um all a bubble and Morgan Stanley is like well the customers we're talking to their biggest concern is anxiety that they don't have enough chips or that they won't be next up in line to get the latest chip not that there's a bubble in too many chips or too many data centers. And so I think when you look at it from that perspective, and we'll keep covering it every single day on this show because that is the side of the argument that the data is leading me to believe. And I'm trying to be super objective here, if I've got a bad investment in Nvidia, I would want to know first before anyone else so I could sell it, right? Like I'm trying to be very objective and say, is this real or is it not? And based on all the data we're looking at, based on the numbers that I'm looking at, it seems very, very real. And as a result, it does not seem like it's going anywhere. And it seems like Nvidia is going to continue to grow and maintain this moment.</p>
</details>

关于英伟达的最后一件事。这是他们现在的13F文件。Synopsis的估值为20亿美元，或者说英伟达持有其20亿美元的股份。Coreweave曾价值33亿美元，现在是18亿美元，然后是英特尔（Intel），大约85亿美元。所以我认为英伟达也正在成为有点像伯克希尔哈撒韦（Berkshire Hathaway）那样的控股公司，持有许多股权。这很合理。他们有太多现金。回购股票无济于事，派发股息也无济于事。他们需要将这些钱重新投入到生态系统中，而不是以芯片销售的形式收回这些钱，而是让这些公司能够真正利用这些钱来增长自己的收益。我认为如果英伟达继续这样做，那是他们如何在不采取任何行动的情况下增长每股收益的另一个角度，只是让这些公司继续增长，因为这些股权将在十年后影响英伟达的收益。这是另一种思考方式，即这只股票明年仍以25倍市盈率交易，相当便宜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Last quick thing on Nvidia. This is what their 13F looks like now. Synopsis, $2 billion valuation or $2 billion stake. Coreweave was worth 3.3 billion. Now it's 1.8 billion and then Intel at about eight and a half billion. So I think Nvid is also becoming a little bit of a Birkshire Hathaway, you know, kind of a holding company for a lot of these equity stakes. And it makes sense. They have too much cash. Buying back the stock's not going to help. Giving a dividend is not going to help. they need to put that money back into the ecosystem and not get that money back in terms of chip sales, but get these companies to be able to really use that money to grow their own earnings. And I think if Nvidia continues to do that, that's another angle on how they can grow earnings per share without having to do anything, just letting those companies continue to grow as the equity stakes will uh influence Nvidia's earnings a decade from now. And that's another way to think that this stock continues to be at 25 times earnings next year, pretty cheap.</p>

### 日元套利交易与加密货币市场

好的，下一个话题。让我们来谈谈日本。那么，昨晚发生了什么？比特币从91,000美元跌至85,000美元。这种下跌今天继续影响着比特币。MicroStrategy、BMR、以太坊（Ethereum）等所有这些股票都受到了严重打击。比特币目前在86,000美元。那么，为什么比特币会下跌，为什么它在过去24小时内遭受了如此大的痛苦？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, next topic. Let's get into it. We got Japan. So, what happened last night? Bitcoin fell from 91,000 to 85,000. That carnage has continued to affect Bitcoin today. Uh Micro Strategy, BMR, Ethereum, all those stocks getting hit badly. Bitcoin right now at 86,000. So why is Bitcoin selling off and why is it having as much pain as it has been having over the past basically 24 hours?</p>
</details>

日本国债收益率再次上升。日本国债收益率上周在所有刺激措施公布后就开始上升。基本上，当债券收益率上升时，意味着债券的价值下降。投资者正在抛售这些债券，因为他们害怕某些事情。在这种情况下，债券收益率往往预示着对通货膨胀、一个国家的信贷状况或一个国家偿还债务能力的担忧。原因有很多，但最主要的原因是，人们不完全确定政府正在实施的货币政策是否有效。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, Japanese bond yields are rising again. Now, Japanese bond yields were rising last week after the announcement of all the stimulus. And basically, when bond yields go up, that means the value of bonds go down. Uh investors are um selling off those bonds because they are afraid of something. In this case, bond yields tend to be signaling afraid of uh well, I mean, when you're selling off bonds, it tends to be signaling you're afraid either of inflation, you're afraid of the credit situation in a country. You're afraid of the ability for a country to pay back its debt. I mean, there's a variety of reasons, but the number one reason is you're not fully sure that the monetary policy that the government is engaging in is effective.</p>
</details>

那么，昨晚真正引发了大量关注，但这种关注最终对比特币的价格走势来说并不那么令人兴奋的是，日本10年期国债收益率达到了自2008年4月以来的最高水平。各位，日本市场的10年期国债收益率最终上升到1.8%。所以，这并不是一个好现象。而这并不是一个好现象的原因是，这些收益率不能以天文数字的水平飙升。它们飙升得越多，投资者对该国正在发生的事情的信心就越感到担忧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, what really sparked a lot of excitement last night, and that excitement ended up being not as exciting for the price action of Bitcoin, is that the 10-year Japanese yield, 10-year bond, uh, ended up yielding its highest percentage since April of 2008. Folks, the 10-year on Japanese markets ended up going up to 1.8%. So, this was not good to see. And and the reason this was not good to see is because you cannot have these yields spiking at astronomical levels. The more they spike, the more investor confidence gets scared about what the heck is going on in the country of the yield or the bond that is spiking.</p>
</details>

而该国目前在宏观层面遇到问题的一部分原因是，日本是美国国债最大的持有国之一。因此，如果人们不信任日本债务，并说：“我们要抛售你们的债券，因为我们认为你们在货币政策方面做得不对。”那么，这个国家就必须以某种方式获得资金来履行其义务。显然，大多数国家都是通过债务来融资的。美国显然发行了大量债务。我们通常能为我们的债务找到市场的原因是，人们知道我们是美国，每个人都会购买我们的债务，或者我们至少会信守我们的债务，所以人们愿意购买。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and and and part of the reason why the um country is having some issues right now from a macro perspective is that Japan is one of the largest owners of US treasuries. So, if people aren't trusting Japanese debt and and and saying, "We're going to sell off your bonds because we don't, you know, we don't think what you're doing is right when it comes to monetary policy." Well, that country has to get the money to finance their obligations in some capacity. Obviously, most countries are financing it through debt. Uh, the United States obviously issues a lot of debt. The reason we usually get a market for our debt is because people know that we're the United States and everyone's going to buy our debt or we're at least going to be good for our debt, so people want to buy it.</p>
</details>

人们开始担心日本可能无法支付其债务利息，或者至少投资者会说：“嘿，如果你要拿走我们的钱，我们需要更多的利息。我们需要这些债券有更高的收益率。所以，我们将抛售这些债券，直到你给我们这个收益率，也就是说，这些利率对我们来说更高，我们才会更兴奋地购买你的债券。”现在，如果日本不得不出售其资产负债表上持有的1.1万亿美元美国债券，以资助他们正在做的事情，那对我们的债券市场来说也不是最好的事情，因为那样我们的债券收益率就会飙升，然后这会在美国的各种资产中制造问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um you are starting to get some fears that Japan might not be good for the interest that they owe on the debt or at least investors are saying, "Hey, if you're going to take our money, we need a lot more interest. We need a lot more yield on these bonds. So, we're going to sell these bonds until you give us this yield, aka these rates go higher for us to be more excited to buy your bonds." Uh, now if Japan had to sell the 1.1 trillion of US bonds that they have on their balance sheet to be able to finance whatever they're doing, that would also not be the best thing in the world for our bond markets because then our bond yields would spike and then that would create issues in a variety of uh assets in the United States.</p>
</details>

那么，这如何影响股市呢？这又回到了日元套利交易。我想现在人们应该已经听说过这个了。2020年4月或2024年8月，这种交易首次开始。但是，做空日元（即日元这种日本货币）一直是对冲基金做多美国科技股的最佳方式之一，因为日元和美元之间的套利可以很容易地被利用，因为日本一直试图确保其日元兑美元贬值。现在，日元正在升值，不仅因为他们在国内发行刺激措施，这让债券市场觉得“这里到底发生了什么？”你们负担不起这样做。而且日本也提高了利率，他们很可能在12月19日再次提高利率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, how does this affect the stock market? It goes back to the yen carry trade. I think people have heard about this by now. April 2020 or August 2024 is when this kind of first started. But the yen and shorting the yen, which is the Japanese currency, has been one of the best ways for hedge funds in particular to go long US tech stocks because the arbitrage between the yen and the dollar is something that could easily be exploited because Japan always has tried to make sure their yen depreciated against the dollar. Now, the yen is appreciating because not only are they uh issuing stimulus in the country, which is getting the bond market to be like, "What the hell is going on here?" Like, you guys can't afford to do this. Um, but Japan's also raised rates and they're likely going to raise rates again on December 19th.</p>
</details>

我试图理解他们为什么要这样做，因为这似乎有点反直觉。你为什么要同时印钞和加息呢？但是，日本在通货紧缩、利率、劳动力市场、过去20年停滞的工资以及基本上20年通货紧缩后开始出现的通货膨胀之间存在着独特的关系。所以他们必须同时做多件事情。我不是完全了解他们如何应对的专家，但市场显然对他们正在做的事情并不满意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I I've tried to understand why they're doing this because it kind of seems counterintuitive. Why would you print money and then raise rates at the same time? Uh, but there's a unique relationship Japan Japan has between deflation, interest rates, their labor market, their stagnant wages over the past 20 years and the rising inflation that has started to happen after basically 20 years of deflation. And so they kind of got to do multiple things at once. I'm not fully, you know, an expert on exactly how they're navigating it, but the market's obviously not the happiest about what they're doing.</p>

除此之外，日本还面临着巨大的人口危机。顺便说一句，日本首相之所以是现任首相，第一位女首相，是因为前任首相试图增加移民，因为他认为“人们正在变老。年轻人不想做这些工作。我们需要一些移民来支撑日本的工人阶级。”所以他想从尼日利亚和印度引进50万移民到日本。结果国家非常愤怒。日本人起来反抗。首相不得不耻辱地辞职。这真的是一件事。他被羞辱了，不得不向全国道歉。然后出现了一位新首相，他承诺不会有大规模的疯狂移民，并会提供大量刺激措施。所以市场现在并不真正相信日本正在发生的事情。

<p class="english-text">On top of that, Japan has a massive population crisis. The reason the Japanese prime minister, by the way, even is the current prime minister right now, the the first woman prime minister, is because the previous prime minister tried to increase immigration because he was like, "People are getting older. Young people don't want to do these jobs. We're going to need some immigration to to to bolster up the working class of Japan." So he wanted to import 500,000 Nigerians and Indians into the country. Country got really mad. Japan people revolted. The prime minister had to resign out of disgrace. That's like a real thing. He like was disgraced. He had to apologize to the country. And you had a new prime minister that promised no massive crazy immigration and lots of stimulus. So the market's not really buying exactly what's going on right now in Japan.</p>

如果日元继续兑美元升值，那些做空日元并做多比特币等资产的对冲基金，因为在日本借贷成本远低于美国，他们就不得不卖掉他们的比特币，或者卖掉他们的英伟达，或者卖掉他们做多的任何科技股，然后回购他们的空头头寸，如果利率走高，就平仓他们的空头头寸。这种套利是导致比特币等高风险资产下跌的潜在原因。现在，英伟达有一个优势，那就是在我看来，英伟达在基本面基础上是便宜的。如果你看它的收益，比特币纯粹是投机。我这样说并不是看跌比特币。事实上，恰恰相反。但是，你没有任何收益可以说比特币比英伟达便宜，或者比特币比苹果便宜。不，它只是纯粹的直觉情绪和人们的感觉。

<p class="english-text">If the yen continues to appreciate against the dollar, hedge funds that were short the yen long something like Bitcoin because the cost of borrowing is significantly cheaper than the cost of borrowing in the United States, they have to sell their Bitcoin or sell their Nvidia or sell whatever tech stock they're long on and buy back their short, cover their short position if rates go higher. And that arbitrage is what's potentially creating the decline in very heavy risk on assets like a Bitcoin. Now, the one thing Nvidia has going for it is that Nvidia is cheap on a in my opinion fundamental basis. If you look at the earnings, Bitcoin is pure speculation. Now, I don't say that as someone who's bearish Bitcoin. In fact, quite the opposite. But, um, quite lit legitimately, you don't have any earnings to say Bitcoin's cheap compared to Nvidia or Bitcoin's cheap compared to like Apple. It's like, no, it's just like it's pure gut emotion and how people feel.</p>
</details>

如果他们需要获得流动性的首要任务是出售高风险资产，而比特币是一个24小时开放的流动性非常高的市场，那么与英伟达相比，英伟达也是一个高风险资产。但如果你认为英伟达便宜，那么人们可能会持有他们的英伟达股票，而出售他们最具投机性的头寸，比如比特币、以太坊或Solana。这就是造成加密货币市场混乱的原因。再加上汤姆·李（Tom Lee）提出的去杠杆化理论。我知道你把这两者结合起来，也许这个理论完全正确，也许不完全正确，但这些加密资产上肯定存在保证金和杠杆，而现在由于日本正在发生的事情，这些杠杆不再那么容易获得。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if the number one thing they need to do to get liquidity, which it's a very liquid market open 24 hours, is sell a risk-on asset versus Nvidia, which is also a risk on asset. But if you think Nvidia is cheap, then maybe people are holding on to their video and they're selling their most speculative positions like a Bitcoin or Ethereum or Salana. That is what's creating the carnage in the crypto market. that along with the deleveraging uh thesis that Tom Lee has had. I know you put those two together, maybe that thesis is fully correct, maybe it's not fully correct, but there's definitely margin and leverage on these crypto assets that's now not as easily accessible based on what's happening in Japan.</p>
</details>

这会引爆美国股市吗？我不这么认为。但我也不完全清楚。我的意思是，我绝对不认为日元套利交易会平仓到足以让整个美国标普500指数股市大幅下跌的程度。它是否影响了许多高风险资产的投资者情绪？当然。但标普500指数距离高点不到1%。所以对我来说，这对于比特币这种具有全球流动性的高风险资产来说是一个问题。不一定是对于一个正在创造创纪录收益、并且美联储准备降息的股市。我的意思是，有很多不同的因素正在发生，这就是为什么我认为美国股市会没事的，但我认为这正在造成加密货币市场的混乱。希望这不会蔓延到股市。如果蔓延了，我们将不得不看看美国如何应对。

<p class="english-text">Is this going to blow up the US stock market? I don't think so. But I don't fully know. Well, I mean, I I I definitely don't think the yen carry trade is something that can unwind to the point where the entire United States S&P 500 stock market takes a meaningful draw down. Has it affected kind of the investor sentiment around a lot of these risk on assets? Sure. But the S&P 500 is less than 1% away from high. So, so, so to me it's it's it's something that's an issue for particularly risk on assets that have global liquidity like a Bitcoin. Not necessarily a stock market that is putting up record earnings that's getting a Fed that's ready to cut. Like, you have a lot of different things going on for why I think the US is going to be okay in terms of our stock market, but I think that's creating the carnage in crypto. Hopefully, that doesn't bleed into the stock market. And if it does, we're going to have to see how the United States deals with this when it comes to</p>

### 宏观经济更新：美联储、量化紧缩与消费支出

好的，我们要讨论的最后一件事是一些宏观经济头条新闻。首先，鲍威尔（JPA）今天正在讲话。事实上，在我录制这段视频的时候，他可能正在讲话。我怀疑他会说出任何对市场有意义的话。我的意思是，也许他会。如果他说了，我们明天在开盘时会讨论。但如果他没有，那可能就不是那么重要的事情。美联储会议是在2月10日。不，是12月10日，也就是一周后。实际上，2月没有美联储会议。是1月、3月，然后是4月。所以，有87.66%的可能性，这是几周以来的最高点。看起来我们将会降息，这非常看涨，因为如果日本加息，那么我们肯定需要降息。总的来说，我认为这个市场并没有为我们不降息的情况定价。所以我们需要以有意义的方式降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, last thing we're going to talk about is some macro updates in terms of headlines. First of all, JPA is speaking today. In fact, he's probably speaking right now as I'm recording this. Um, I doubt he's going to say anything that meaningful around the markets. I mean, maybe he will. If he does, we'll talk about it tomorrow on the market open, but uh if he doesn't, then it's probably not going to be something that's going to be that important. The Fed meeting is on February 10th. I will February 10th. Maybe there is a Fed meeting on February 10th as well. December 10th, which is a week from now. Um, there is actually no Fed meeting in February. It's January, March, and then April. So, uh, 87.6 6% chance, highest it's been in weeks. It looks like we are going to get this rate cut, which is super bullish because again, if Japan's hiking, then we definitely need to be cutting. And in general, I think this market is not priced for us not getting the rate cut. So, we're going to need to get that rate cut in a meaningful way.</p>
</details>

所以降息即将到来。顺便说一句，**QT**（Quantitative Tightening: 量化紧缩，央行通过出售资产或停止再投资来减少货币供应的政策）今天，也就是12月1日正式停止，这是美联储出售其资产负债表上的抵押贷款支持证券。希望降息和QT的结束能有更多的流动性进入系统，这对像比特币这样需要表现更好的资产来说也非常重要。顺便说一句，我最后要说的是，我忘了提到日本。他们正在对加密货币实行20%的统一税率。所以，你又看到了他们如何在国内推行刺激措施的更多细微之处。但这理论上可能看跌加密货币，因为人们知道他们不必支付大量税款，所以会抛售；或者看涨，因为知道他们出售获利时不必支付巨额税款，会有更多资金流入系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, so rate cuts on the way. QT, by the way, quantitative tightening officially stops today, December 1st, which is the Fed selling off mortgage back securities on their balance sheet. more liquidity entering the system from rate cuts hopefully and from the end of QT which is also going to be very very important for assets like Bitcoin that need to do better. By the way, last thing I got to say, I I forgot to mention this on Japan. Um they're moving to a 20% flat tax on crypto. So again, you got even more nuance to kind of how they're navigating the the stimulus in the country. But that could theoretically be bearish crypto because then people are selling because they know they don't have to pay a lot of taxes or that's bullish because you get a lot more money coming into the system knowing that they're not going to have to pay massive taxes whenever they do sell for a profit.</p>
</details>

所以加密货币市场正在发生这些事情。Vanguard也允许人们从明天开始购买比特币ETF。Vanguard的首席执行官几个月前或一年前曾表示，他们绝不会允许人们在其平台上购买比特币。他们不得不适应，这种适应开始对像比特币这样的资产非常有帮助。其他宏观数据，VO在11月份创下了月度资金流入记录，达到208.8亿美元，是过去四年中的第二高，也是连续第五个月的资金流入。今年迄今为止，VO的净流入已增长17%，达到1240亿美元，有望创下自成立以来最大的年度资金流入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so you've got that happening in crypto. Vanguard is also allowing people as of tomorrow to start buying the Bitcoin ETF. The Vanguard CEO said a couple months ago or a year ago, they would never let people buy Bitcoin on the platform. They've had to adapt and that adaptation is starting to be very helpful for an asset like Bitcoin. Other macro stats, VO monthly record flows in November 20.8 8 billion, second highest in the last four years, fifth consecutive monthly inflow. And year to date, VO net inflows are now up 17% to 124 billion on track for its biggest yearly inflow since inception.</p>
</details>

当市场担心人工智能泡沫时，投资者仍在继续购买美国股票，押注全球最大的科技公司，并相信这些科技公司将继续做好它们需要做的事情。所以，我认为关于人工智能泡沫有很多噪音。我听黄仁勋讲话，我看收益，我看资金流向。顺便说一句，高盛（Goldman Sachs）上周表示，他们在过去几天的低点买入，创下了过去几年来的最高纪录，那是在两周前的周四和周五，标普指数触及650点左右。我的意思是，你开始看到越来越多的数据表明，这些机会是人们想要抓住的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As the market worries about an AI bubble, you have investors that continue to buy essentially America betting on the biggest tech companies in the world and that these tech companies will continue to do what they need to do. So, I think a lot of noise is out there around AI bubble. I listen to Jensen speak. I look at the earnings. I look at where the money is being allocated to. Hedge funds. By the way, Goldman Sachs said last week that they bought the dip at the highest record over the past couple years in the in the last two days, which was like the last two days of the week where the S&P hit like 650. Um, so I think that was that Thursday and Friday of two weeks ago. They bought the dip. I mean, you're just starting to see more and more data come out saying that these opportunities end up being opportunities that people want to take advantage of.</p>
</details>

这是瑞安·迪特里希（Ryan Dietrich）的图表，我也觉得非常重要。很多人一直在问：“嘿，埃米特，圣诞老人行情什么时候发生？”首先，我不知道圣诞老人行情是否一定会发生。关于这部分数据，有一点需要记住的是，通常圣诞老人行情，也就是12月份平均1.4%的上涨，自1950年以来有75%的时间发生，历史上是基于9月和10月的糟糕表现。所以你会看到9月和10月糟糕表现的反转，进入年底。你还有基金经理追逐市场。还有很多其他不同的论点。也许这次不会发生，因为9月、10月和11月都是上涨的。即使11月经历了所有的痛苦，也勉强上涨了0.3%。所以我确实认为人们应该记住，这次12月可能不会有圣诞老人行情，因为我们已经连续三个月上涨了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is a chart from Ryan Dietrich right here. I also thought was really important. A lot of people have been asking, "Hey Emit, when does the Santa Claus rally happen?" First of all, don't know if the Santa Claus rally is definitely going to happen. One thing to remember about that piece of data is that usually the Santa Claus rally, which is a 1.4% rally the month of December, uh, happening 75% of the time since 1950, historically is based on September and October sucking. So you get a lot of the sort of reversal of September and October sucking going into the end of the year. You also have fund managers chasing. There's a bunch of different other arguments. Um maybe that doesn't happen because September, October, and November were all green. Even November inched out a 03% green month with all the pain that we had to go through. So I I do think people should just remember December this time might not be a Santa Claus rally because we had three green months in a row.</p>
</details>

当然，有很多原因让我认为它可能会发生，比如降息、财报等。但从历史上看，是9月到11月期间的波动性创造了12月的动能。如果我们要迎来圣诞老人行情，它应该在年底的最后两周发生。所以，正如你所看到的，12月1日到12月15日相对平稳。然后从12月15日到31日，你才会看到真正的走势。所以，如果它确实发生，我们应该在接下来的几周内期待它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now granted, there's a lot of reasons why I think it could happen. The rate cut, earnings, etc., But historically, it's been the volatility around September through November that creates that December momentum. If we were to get a set and close rally, it should happen by the last two weeks of the year. So, as you can see, December 1st to December 15th, relatively flat. And then December 15th to the 31st is when you get your real move. So, if it does happen, we should be expecting it over the next couple weeks.</p>

### 2026年展望与投资思路

然后我们进入2026年，我认为这将是微妙且充满变数的一年。我很快会制作更多关于如何应对2026年以及投资组合构建的视频，包括我对2026年走向的看法，以及我持有的进入新年的头寸。我想我现在可以给你们一点预览。我认为Meta、微软（Microsoft）、亚马逊（Amazon）和英伟达。如果我必须从中选择三家，Meta、亚马逊和英伟达，我认为它们在2026年是很容易的选择。我们将对此进行更多讨论。我甚至不认为说这些有什么争议。亚马逊是我最喜欢的，因为英伟达我已经持有大量头寸，Meta也有头寸，但不是大量头寸。亚马逊，我只是认为**AWS**（Amazon Web Services: 亚马逊云计算服务）的增长加上机器人技术将提高运营利润率。它是下一个达到300美元的公司。我们看到谷歌做到了。我认为亚马逊明年也会做到。所以，我认为这三家公司将是进入2026年的一些明显的多头选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then we get into 2026, which I think is going to be something that is, I think, nuanced, has a lot of variables. I'm going to be making a lot more videos soon on uh navigating 2026 and kind of just portfolio construction, my ideas for where 2026 is going, uh positions I have going into the year. I I think I give you guys a little preview right now. I think Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Nvidia. And if I had to pick three of those, Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia, I think those are easy in 2026. And we'll we'll we'll talk a lot more about it. I don't even think it's controversial saying that. Amazon being my favorite of them because Nvidia already have a big position and Meta have a position, not a massive position. Amazon, I just think AWS growth plus robotics increasing operating margins. It's it's it's the next one to go to 300. We saw Google do it. I think Amazon's going to do it next year. So, I think those three are going to be some obvious longs going into 2026.</p>
</details>

最后一件事，“网络星期一”和“黑色星期五”，消费者的业绩绝对是惊人的。我的意思是，我没想到会这么好，但它确实非常非常好。所以，看看“黑色星期五”的数据。Shopify的首席执行官托比·卢特克（Tobi Lütke）。顺便说一句，Shopify今天下跌了5%。我认为是因为他们出现了一点故障，这实际上有点看涨，因为这意味着他们的平台需求量巨大。黑色星期五期间，商家同比增长了25%。销售额达到62亿美元。峰值时每分钟处理4.8亿次请求。数据库查询峰值每秒5300万次。API在峰值时每分钟处理超过3100万次请求。我的意思是，这个疲软的消费者在哪里？因为有Abercrombie、Kohl's、Best Buy、Burlington。我们上周看到了Urban Outfitters。我们明天会看到American Eagle的情况。但我没想到这些服装公司会有如此创纪录的第三季度业绩。我的意思是，这真的就像这些东西是从哪里来的？但它仍然强劲。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, last thing, Cyber Monday, Black Friday, absolutely monster monster results from the consumer. I mean, I didn't expect it to be this good, but it's pretty freaking good. So, take a look at this for Black Friday. Uh, Toby Luke, the CEO of Shopify. Shopify, by the way, it was down 5% today. I think because they had a little bit of an outage, which means actually kind of bullish because it means that they have so much demand on their platform. 25% yearover-year growth for merchants on Black Friday. 6.2 billion in sales. Edge peaked at 480 million requests per minute. Peak database queries 53 million per second. API process over 31 million requests per minute at the peak. I mean, where is this weak consumer? Because you had Abberrombi, Kohl's, Best Buy, Burlington. We'll see Urban Outfitters last week. We'll see tomorrow with American Eagle what ends up happening. But I did not expect these clothing companies to have these record Q3s. I mean, it really it's just like where is this stuff coming from? But it continues to be strong.</p>
</details>

如果所有这些公司都出来展示这种对他们继续证明消费者不像某些人认为的那么疲软非常重要的收益增长，即使消费者可能不完美，而消费者显然100%不完美。如果消费者表现好于预期，那么我们正在放松货币政策，企业收益良好。正如你在这里看到的，根据Adobe Analytics的数据，“黑色星期五”销售额创下历史新高，达到118亿美元。Salesforce报告“黑色星期五”总支出为180亿美元。我们明天可能会得到亚马逊的数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if all these companies are coming out and they're showing the types of earnings growth that is very very important for them to continue proving that the consumer is not as weak as some people think, even though the consumer might not be perfect, which 100% the consumer is obviously not perfect. If the consumer is better than expected, well, and we're easing and corporate earnings are good. And as you can see right here, Black Friday sales hit a record high 11.8 billion as per Adobe Analytics. Salesforce reported 18 billion in total Black Friday spending. We'll get Amazon's numbers probably tomorrow.</p>
</details>

顺便说一句，亚马逊确实表示，他们的**LLM**（Large Language Model: 大语言模型）Rufus实际上影响了他们的“黑色星期五”销售，并使其对客户更高效。所以这是人工智能为其电子商务销售带来的顺风。感觉如果消费者不像我们想象的那么糟糕，也许明年我们不会有那么多次降息，尽管一旦特朗普（Trump）重新掌权，可能会有更多降息。但如果消费者不是那么糟糕，它确实糟糕，但不是那么糟糕。这里有一个微妙之处，那就是我们可以降息，劳动力市场不会崩溃。我们也许可以避免劳动力市场崩溃。如果我们降息，消费者情况不那么糟糕。所以他们可以继续消费。公司收益可以继续显示出动能和增长。然后利率下降，这应该会总体上创造更多的流动性和金融系统的宽松。然后，如果这些人工智能技术提高了生产力、利润率，也许我们不得不担心通货紧缩，而不是通货膨胀。我的意思是，2026年可能会发生很多事情，但“消费者疲软”的说法正在受到挑战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And by the way, Amazon did come out and say that Rufus, their LLM, has actually influenced how their Black Friday sales have gone and just made it more efficient for customers. So that's AI being a tailwind for their e-commerce sales. Um it it it does feel like if the consumer is not as bad as we think, maybe we're not going to get that many rate cuts going into next year, although once Trump replaces power, get a lot more rate cuts. But if the consumer is not that bad, it's bad, but it's not that bad. There's this nuance of okay, we can cut rates, the labor market doesn't collapse. We can probably save the labor market from collapsing. If we cut rates, the consumer is not horrible. So, they can keep spending. Company earnings can keep showing uh momentum and growth. And then you've got rates coming down which should overall create more liquidity and easing in the financial system. And then if this AI stuff increases productivity, margins, maybe we have to worry about deflation, not inflation. I mean, there's a lot of things that can happen in 2026, but this consumer's week narrative is being challenged.</p>
</details>

Chipotle和星巴克（Starbucks）告诉我们消费者很疲软。Urban Outfitters和Abercrombie & Fitch，这些销售75美元连帽衫的公司，却告诉我们消费者很好。现在，也许是消费者的一部分补贴了另一部分。这是一个合理的观点，但上周有大约七家公司。**XRT**（SPDR S&P Retail ETF: 标普零售业ETF）创下了自2025年5月以来最好的两天涨幅。今天上午的**ISM PMI**（Institute for Supply Management Purchasing Managers' Index: 供应管理协会采购经理人指数）数据不尽如人意，我们未能达到预期，但这些零售商的收益相当不错。所以，我认为我们需要更多数据来了解零售业正在发生什么，但如果我们在挑战“消费者疲软”的说法，这对企业来说并不是最糟糕的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Chipotle and Starbucks told us the consumer is weak. Urban Outfitters and Abbercrombrian Fish, which sells $75 hoodies, are telling us the consumer is fine. Now, maybe it's one part of the consumer that's subsidizing the other part of the consumer. That's a fair point, but it was like seven companies last week. XRT, the retailer ETF, had its best two-day stretch since May of 2025. ISM PMI data this morning was not necessarily the best. We we missed on expectations, but these retailer earnings are pretty good. So, I think we're going to need more data to see what's happening in the world of retail, but if we're challenging this consumer's week narrative, that's not the worst thing for corporate.</p>
