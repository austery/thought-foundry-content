title: 自闭症诊断的困境：不断扩大的定义与资源分配的挑战
---

### 自闭症诊断率的惊人增长与误解

来自《纽约时报》，我是瑞秋·艾布拉姆斯，这里是《The Daily》。小罗伯特·F·肯尼迪多次将自闭症发病率的飙升视为其作为卫生与公众服务部部长的核心使命。他将责任归咎于从泰诺到疫苗的一切，最近他指示疾病控制与预防中心（**CDC**：美国疾病控制与预防中心）放弃其长期以来的立场，即疫苗不会导致自闭症。然而，尽管近几十年来自闭症的发病率有所增加，但其原因比肯尼迪所呈现的更为复杂。

<p class="english-text">From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams and this is the Daily. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has repeatedly cited the skyrocketing autism rates as central to his mission as Health and Human Services Secretary. He's laid the blame at the feet of everything from Tylenol to vaccines, and he recently instructed the CDC to abandon its long-standing position that the latter do not cause autism. But while the rates of autism have increased in recent decades, the reasons are more complicated than what Kennedy has presented.</p>
</details>

今天，阿津·古雷斯解释了真正推动诊断数量增加的原因。今天是11月24日星期一。阿津，特别是“让美国再次健康”运动和RFK，确实让自闭症成为了焦点。小RFK当然称自闭症为一种流行病。我认为公平地说，他已经让人们对自闭症的根本原因产生了很大的恐惧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Today, Azen Gures explains what's really driving the increase in diagnosis. It's Monday, November 24th. So Azine, the Make America Healthy Again movement and RFK in particular have really put autism in the spotlight. RFK Jr. of course has called autism an epidemic. And I think it is fair to say that he has instilled a lot of fear in people about what the root causes of autism are.</p>
</details>

你作为记者，花了很多时间思考这个问题。所以我想从这里开始，特别是我想谈谈这些数字。是的，在美国，儿童自闭症的诊断率几十年来一直持续上升。在2000年，也就是CDC开始收集这方面数据的第一年，他们发现美国每158名8岁儿童中就有一人被诊断出自闭症。这个数字在他们发布报告的每一年都持续上升。他们今年发布的最新数据显示，每31名8岁儿童中就有一人被诊断出自闭症。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you've spent a lot of time thinking about this as part of your reporting. And so that's where I'd like to start. And in particular, I want to talk about the numbers. Yeah. So, autism diagnoses among children in the United States have been rising pretty consistently for decades. In the year 2000, which is the first year that the CDC started collecting data on this question, they found that one in 158-y olds in the United States had an autism diagnosis. That number has risen consistently every year that they have published their report. And the most recent data that they published, which came out this year, found that one in 31year-olds has an autism diagnosis.</p>
</details>

所以这个比例从150分之一上升到每31个孩子中就有一个。是的，我的意思是，这是一个巨大的增长，对吧？RFK真的把它描述成一场流行病。他说，你知道，我们的环境中有什么东西正在导致自闭症像野火一样蔓延，但这具有误导性。你知道，我采访过的所有专家都承认，环境因素可能与我们的基因相互作用，共同导致自闭症的增加。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it goes from 1 in 150 to one in every 31 children. Yeah. And I mean, that's a huge increase, right? And RFK really frames this as an epidemic. He says, you know, there's something in our environment that is causing autism to spread like wildfire, but that's misleading. You know, from all the experts that I've spoken to, they've acknowledged that there are environmental factors that likely interact with our genetics that are contributing to the rise in autism.</p>
</details>

例如，有污染，人们选择晚育等因素，但这些最终只占这一增长解释的一小部分。我们所知的导致这一增长的最大原因实际上与我们如何定义自闭症有关。而且这个定义在过去几十年里一直在扩大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, there's things like pollution, for example, people choosing to have children later in life, but those are ultimately a really small part of the explanation for this rise. And the biggest reason that we know of that is driving this increase actually has to do with how we define what autism is. And that definition has been expanding over the last several decades.</p>
</details>

### 自闭症定义的演变：从狭窄到广谱

所以基本上，你是说这个“帐篷”变得更大了，但并不一定是因为患有自闭症的人数真正地从根本上增加了，即使这只是其中一部分原因。而是有更多的人被纳入了这个不断扩大的定义之中。是的。但是，关于这个“帐篷”是否变得过大，争论也越来越多。这些争论关乎资源，关乎研究优先级。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So basically, you're saying that the tent has gotten bigger, but not necessarily because there is a true fundamental increase in the number of people who have autism, even if that's part of it. It's that more people are being captured within this expanding definition. Yes. But there has been a growing fight over whether this tent has grown too large. These are fights over resources. their fights over research priorities.</p>
</details>

研究此问题的家长、活动家、医生和科学家们开始真正思考，鉴于这个非常宽泛的“帐篷”下人们的需求可能非常不同，社区中的每个人是否都得到了他们所需的东西。我一直在与一位名叫凯西·洛德的心理学家讨论这些日益紧张的局势。她的职业生涯基本上追踪了我们对自闭症的理解。她是一位传奇的自闭症研究员。她一直积极参与定义这种疾病的标准。所以，她确实一直处于许多这些变化的中心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Parents, activists, doctors, scientists who are researching this are starting to really grapple with whether everyone in the community is getting what they need given that the needs of people under this very broad tent can be very different. And one of the people I've been talking to for a while about these rising tensions is this psychologist named Kathy Lord. Her career basically tracks our understanding of autism. She is a legendary autism researcher. She has been actively involved in defining criteria for the disorder. So, she's really been at the center of a lot of this change.</p>
</details>

给我讲讲她和她的背景故事。她是一名临床心理学家。嗨，凯西。你好。她在加州大学洛杉矶分校（**UCLA**：加州大学洛杉矶分校）。她整个职业生涯都在研究和与自闭症患者一起工作。是什么让你最初进入自闭症领域？我想我喜欢这些孩子。我只是觉得他们太有趣了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tell me a little bit about her and sort of her backstory. So, she is a clinical psychologist. Hi, Kathy. Hello. She's at UCLA. She has spent her whole career studying and working with people with autism. What What drew you to the field of autism in the first place? I think I like the kids. I just thought they're so interesting.</p>
</details>

凯西在1970年代作为本科生开始与今天我们称之为自闭症的儿童一起工作。我当时看到的那些孩子，我们认为他们不会说话。我们认为他们不能说话。他们不看我们。凯西当时看到的孩子，许多都有智力障碍。有些孩子会来回摇晃，避免眼神交流。他们中的许多人不会说话，不能说话，甚至只会重复别人对他们说的话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kathy in the 1970s as an undergrad started working with children who had what today we would call autism. The kids that I saw then, we assumed they were not verbal. We assumed they couldn't talk. They did not look at us. The kids that Kathy was seeing, many of them had intellectual disabilities. Some of the kids would be rocking back and forth, avoiding eye contact. Many of them wouldn't talk, couldn't talk, or even would just repeat what was said back to them.</p>
</details>

我们不明白为什么一个孩子会以不寻常的方式移动他们的手指，像海星一样，或者为什么当他们看到有人把东西放在一个他们意想不到的地方时会感到不安。当时，心理学家和精神病学家认为这可能是一种精神分裂症。所以，最初它被认为是儿童精神分裂症或婴儿精神病。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We didn't understand why would a child be moving their fingers in an unusual way like starfish or why were they upset when they, you know, someone put something down in a place that they hadn't expected it to be. And at the time, psychologists and psychiatrists thought maybe this was a form of schizophrenia. So, originally it was both considered childhood schizophrenia or infantile psychosis.</p>
</details>

他们为什么认为它符合精神分裂症或精神病的特征？我想部分原因是当人们做出我们不理解的事情时，我们就会使用“精神病”这个词。临床医生当时告诉家属什么？他们建议什么样的治疗？他们当时没有建议什么？是的，当时家长们基本上被告知无能为力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why did they think why did they think it fit the profile of schizophrenia or psychosis? I think part of it is that we use the term psychosis when people do things that we don't understand. And what were the clinicians telling the families like telling the parents and what kind of treatment were they suggesting that they hadn't? Yeah. So at that time parents were basically told that there was nothing that can be done.</p>
</details>

你知道，甚至不要尝试。就把他们送走。他们应该把孩子送走，过自己的生活，因为他们永远也做不了任何事，这不是真的。但那是人们告诉他们的。那确实是精神病学史上一个相当黑暗时期的鼎盛时期，当时**机构化**（institutionalization：将精神疾病患者送入专门机构进行长期照护的做法）非常普遍。孩子们被送往通常由国家运营的机构，在那里他们基本上被社会隐藏起来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, don't even try. Just send them away and that they should send their kids away and live your life because they'll never be able to do anything, which is not true. But that is what people were telling them. It was really in the heyday of a pretty dark period in psychiatry history where institutionalization was very common. kids were sent off to often state-run institutions where they were basically hidden from society.</p>
</details>

那么，这种状况何时以及如何开始改变的？是的，当凯西进入这个领域时，正是一个转变的时期，人们不再认为这些孩子无法被帮助，而是意识到心理学家实际上可以做一些事情来帮助这些孩子。我如何既调整他们周围的世界，又如何给他们工具，例如，让他们能够沟通，从而学习？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when and how does that start to change? So yeah, when Kathy was entering the field, this is a time when there was a shift away from thinking that these kids could not be helped to realizing that actually there were things that psychologists could do that could help these kids. How do I both adjust the world around them, but also how do I give them tools for example to communicate that would allow them to learn?</p>
</details>

随着这一转变的进行，在1980年，自闭症被纳入了《**精神疾病诊断与统计手册**》（Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders，简称**DSM**：美国精神医学学会出版的、用于诊断精神疾病的标准手册）。这被认为是精神病学的“圣经”。那一年将这个诊断纳入其中，意义重大。这是自闭症首次被正式认定为一种诊断。从那时起，它又走向何方？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And as this shift is underway in the year 1980, autism gets added to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders. And this is considered the bible of psychiatry. The fact that the diagnosis was added in that year was really significant. So this is the first time autism is officially recognized as a diagnosis. Where does it go from there?</p>
</details>

是的。所以当时自闭症的定义非常狭窄。DSM指出，其基本特征是缺乏对其他人的反应、语言问题，以及对环境各个方面的“怪异反应”。所有这些都必须在他们生命的前30个月内发展出来。DSM明确指出，自闭症被认为非常罕见，估计每10,000名儿童中只有大约2到4名会得到这个诊断。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So at the time the definition for autism was very narrow. The DSM said that the essential features were a lack of responsiveness to other people, language problems, and quote bizarre responses to various aspects of the environment. And all of that had to develop in the first 30 months of their lives. The DSM specifically said that autism was considered very rare and it estimated that something like 2 to four kids in every 10,000 would have this diagnosis.</p>
</details>

但几乎从一开始，关于自闭症到底是什么、应该如何定义就存在疑问。我们当时在想，等等，有些人没有语言迟缓，但他们却有自闭症儿童所面临的一些相同的社交困难。临床医生们正在提出关于自闭症到底是什么的非常尖锐的问题。他们问，如果一个孩子没有语言迟缓怎么办？如果他们能说话但说话方式不同怎么办？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But pretty much from the get- go there were questions around what autism actually was, how it should be defined. We were thinking that wait a minute there are people that don't have language delays but who actually have some of the same social difficulties that autistic kids have. Clinicians were asking really sharp questions about what autism really was. They were asking what if a kid does not have a language delay? What if they are able to speak but they speak differently?</p>
</details>

而且我认为人们也更加意识到，认知障碍，比如智力障碍，是自闭症的一个特征，但并非总是存在。不是每个自闭症患者都有智力障碍。当有各种各样、表现形式似乎相同但又不同的孩子时，我们该如何划定这种疾病的界限呢？我们当时说：“等等，我们需要把这个范围扩大。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think also people were more aware that cognitive disabilities like intellectual disabilities are a feature but they're not always there for autism. Not everybody with autism has an intellectual disability. How do we sort of draw lines around this disorder when there seem to be all sorts of kids with sort of different manifestations of what seems like the same thing? We then said, "Wait a minute. we need to make this broader.</p>
</details>

这大概就是**自闭症谱系**（autism spectrum：指自闭症表现形式的多样性和连续性，从轻微到严重）的概念首次被引入的时候，也许这是一种特质的连续体，我们对自闭症的定义思考得有点过于狭隘了。所以医学界在1994年处理这个问题的方式是发生了两个非常大的变化。第一，他们放宽了自闭症本身的诊断标准；第二，他们创建了一个新的相关诊断，叫做**阿斯伯格综合征**（Asperger's：一种神经发育障碍，属于自闭症谱系障碍的一种，通常没有明显的语言或认知发展迟缓）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's sort of when this idea of the autism spectrum gets introduced for the first time that maybe this is sort of a continuum of traits and we're thinking a little too narrowly in the definition of autism that we have. So the way the medical community deals with this is in 1994 two really big changes happen. one they loosen the criteria for autism itself and second they create a new related diagnosis called Asperers and that sort of captures a lot of the edge cases that we were just talking about.</p>
</details>

这大概捕捉了我们刚才谈到的许多边缘案例。所以这是真正扩大我们对自闭症“星座”认知的第一个步骤。那么，扩大定义并同时涵盖这另一类儿童，这是否有助于解决自闭症是什么和不是什么的问题呢？我的意思是，它本应如此，但随后凯西进行了这项研究，试图了解人们实际上是如何被诊断的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it's the first step in really a broadening of what we think of as the sort of constellation of autism. So does broadening the definition and also capturing this other group of kids does that help settle the question of what autism is and isn't? I mean, it was supposed to, but then Kathy does this research that attempts to look at how people are actually being diagnosed.</p>
</details>

我们做了一项研究，数千名儿童接受了相同的诊断测试。她发现，特别是阿斯伯格综合征，是一个非常“模糊”的诊断。决定一个孩子是否会被诊断为阿斯伯格综合征，更多地取决于他们看的是哪位临床医生，而不是他们符合了哪些标准。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We did a study where thousands of kids were seen and all given the same diagnostic batteries. And she finds that asberers in particular is a really squishy diagnosis. that what determines whether a child would get diagnosed with Asberers had more to do with, you know, what clinician they saw than what criteria they met.</p>
</details>

但是中西部的诊所会说某人有自闭症，而东海岸的诊所会说他们有阿斯伯格综合征。这清楚地表明，这些定义仍然不够具体，也不够可靠。这非常令人困惑，导致孩子们在一生中，可能先被诊断为自闭症，然后是阿斯伯格综合征，有时又不得不回到自闭症的诊断。所以，这在科学上似乎真的没有用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the clinic in the Midwest would say somebody had autism and a clinic in the East Coast would say they had Asperers. It made clear that these definitions are still not specific enough and they're not reliable. It was very confusing and resulted in kids who often over a lifetime might get an autism diagnosis, then an asberers diagnosis, and then sometimes have to come back to an autism diagnosis. So, it really seemed like scientifically this is not useful.</p>
</details>

诊断很重要，因为诊断是获得所需特定医疗关注、获得学校特定服务以帮助支持你的关键。诊断也是行为疗法保险覆盖的关键，而且它们还在个人及其家庭如何看待自己以及他们正在挣扎的问题的层面上发挥作用。所以听起来这既具有个人意义，又在资源方面具有相当大的意义，正如你所提到的，对于相关人员来说，无论是医疗保健还是学校资源，甚至更广阔的领域，都存在着重要的利害关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Diagnoses matter because diagnoses are the key to getting the specific medical attention that you need to getting the specific services at school that are going to help support you. A diagnosis is also key for insurance coverage for behavioral therapy and then they also matter at the level of how a person and their family conceives of who they are and what they're struggling with. So it sounds like it's both meaningful personally but also quite meaningful in terms of resources as you mentioned like there are meaningful stakes here for the people involved in terms of what they get access to whether it's healthcare or school resources or beyond.</p>
</details>

是的，没错。因此，这导致医学界再次重新思考他们如何定义自闭症。所以在2013年，凯西实际上是制定这项改变的委员会成员。基本上他们决定的是，我们正在划定的这些界限并不可靠，也不一致。他们决定解决这个问题的方法是将所有内容合并在一个单一的诊断之下：**自闭症谱系障碍**（Autism Spectrum Disorder，简称**ASD**：涵盖了过去多种独立诊断，如自闭症、阿斯伯格综合征等）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, exactly. And so that led to the medical community rethinking once again how they are defining autism. And so in 2013 Kathy was actually on the committee that made this change. Basically what they decided was these lines that we're drawing are not reliable. They're not consistent. And the way that they decided to resolve this issue was to fold everything together under one single diagnosis. So autism spectrum disorder.</p>
</details>

这意味着那些严重残疾的孩子，那些可能无法说话或可能有智力障碍的孩子，与那些以前被诊断为阿斯伯格综合征的人，现在拥有相同的诊断。所以基本上，阿斯伯格综合征作为一个类别被取消了。自闭症的定义正在扩大，整个“帐篷”基本上变得更大了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that meant that the kids who were severely disabled, the kids who maybe couldn't speak or maybe had an intellectual disability had the same diagnosis as someone who would have formerly been diagnosed with Asperers. So basically Aspberers as a category is getting eliminated. The definition of autism is expanding and the whole tent basically is getting bigger.</p>
</details>

嗯。而且它被认定为一个单一的“帐篷”。你知道，以前我认为人们认识到这些事物是相互关联的。现在它被视为一件事，一群人。与我们一直在讨论的变化并行的是，**神经多样性运动**（neurodiversity movement：主张神经发育差异（如自闭症、多动症等）是人类自然多样性的一部分，而非疾病）也随之发展起来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mhm. And it's being recognized as a single tent. You know, before I think there was recognition like these things are related to each other. Now it's being viewed as one thing, one group of people. And sort of in parallel to the changes that we've been talking about, there was also the growth of what became known as the neurodiversity movement.</p>
</details>

这项运动的真正意义在于开始以不同的视角看待自闭症，并拒绝将其视为一种需要治愈的疾病的观念。我想我先从简单介绍一下自闭症到底是什么开始。自闭症是一个非常大的连续体。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This movement was really about beginning to view autism through a different lens and rejecting the idea that it was a disease in need of a cure. I think I'll start out and just talk a little bit about what exactly autism is. Autism is a very big continuum.</p>
</details>

通常，神经多样性运动中的倡导者，比如**坦普尔·格兰丁**（Temple Grandin：美国著名的动物科学家、自闭症倡导者，本人患有自闭症），处于谱系的较轻一端，或者你知道，他们以前会被诊断为阿斯伯格综合征。爱因斯坦、莫扎特和特斯拉今天可能都会被诊断为自闭症谱系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Often the advocates in the neurodiversity movement like Temple Grandon were on the milder end of the spectrum or you know would have formerly had an Asberger's diagnosis. Einstein and Mozart and Tesla would all be probably diagnosed as autistic spectrum today.</p>
</details>

他们强调，这些特质不应被视为病理，而应被视为差异。你知道，有时他们甚至称之为“超能力”，这些特质可以使一个人，一个自闭症患者，以不同的方式看待世界，而这种方式实际上对社会非常有价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And they emphasized that many of these traits instead of being seen as pathologies, they could be seen as just differences. You know, sometimes they even referred to them as superpower that they could be things that made a person, an autistic person, see the world in a different way that was actually really valuable to society.</p>
</details>

在我们的投资委员会会议上，我们实际上会讨论这位创始人是否拥有恰当的“RZ”和“Tis”平衡。马克·扎克伯格的妹妹曾说，你知道，要在科技行业取得成功，你需要一点“RZ”和一点“Tis”。“RZ”代表魅力，“Tis”代表自闭症。神经多样性是一种超能力。我们寻找那些生活方式不同的人。我认为它也代表着一种强度和直接性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Literally in our investment committee meetings, uh, we talk about whether or not this founder has the right balance of RZ and Tis. Mark Zuckerberg's sister is quoted as saying that, you know, to succeed in the technology industry, you need a little bit of the RZ and a little bit of the Tis. rez being charisma and tis being autism. Neurode divergence is a superpower. Uh and we look for people that live their lives differently. And I think it also represents uh an intensity and directness.</p>
</details>

这些早期活动家努力的下游效应是社会对自闭症有了更广泛的认识和接纳。我今晚实际上正在创造历史，成为第一个主持《周六夜现场》（**SNL**：Saturday Night Live，美国一档深夜直播喜剧节目）的阿斯伯格综合征患者。你可以在埃隆·马斯克登上《周六夜现场》的层面上看到这一点，他当时说自己被诊断出患有阿斯伯格综合征。或者至少是第一个承认的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Downstream from the efforts of those early activists was just a broader awareness and embrace of autism in society. I'm actually making history tonight as the first person with Asberers to host SNL. You have that at the level of Elon Musk going on Saturday Night Live and saying at the time that he had an Asperger's diagnosis or at least the first to admit it.</p>
</details>

所以，我们今晚会和演员们进行很多眼神交流。社会对自闭症有一种文化上的接纳，这种接纳延伸到媒体和电视。我们有《生活大爆炸》。我意识到你今晚也独自一人。所以，如果你在某个时候发现自己无事可做，请不要打扰我。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, we'll make a lot of eye contact with the cast tonight. There's sort of a cultural embrace of autism that, you know, extends to media and TV. We have, you know, the Big Bang Theory. I realize you're also on your own tonight. So, if at some point you find yourself with nothing to do, please do not disturb me. [laughter]</p>
</details>

《爱在谱系》（Love on the Spectrum）。我不能，我不能想，不能想出任何话来说，但我仍然玩得很开心。我也是。你认为《芝麻街》上有一个自闭症角色吗？茱莉亚不怎么说话。没错。而且她可能不会像你期望的那样做，比如给你一个击掌。是的。她做事就是有点不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Love on the spectrum. I can't I can't think can't think of anything to say about but I'm still having a good time. Me too. Do you think we have a character with autism on Sesame Street? Julia doesn't say a lot. That's right. And she may not do what you expect like give you a high five. Yeah. She does things just a little differently.</p>
</details>

所以这确实是一场远离污名化自闭症的运动，在某些情况下，人们甚至以自闭症这个标签为荣。阿津，自闭症这个标签在我的有生之年发生了如此巨大的变化，这真的很令人震惊。是的，我认为这都是神经多样性运动的胜利。污名开始消退，以至于对于许多家庭来说，如果他们的孩子有这些困难，获得诊断在某些方面实际上变得可取。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it's really this movement away from stigmatizing autism and being in some cases proud of autism as a label. It's really striking, Azine, how the label autistic has really changed so dramatically just in my lifetime. Yeah, I think this is all really a victory for the neurodiversity movement. And the stigma begins to fade so much that for a lot of families, it actually becomes desirable in some ways to have a diagnosis for your kid if they have some of these struggles.</p>
</details>

它实际上成为他们获得认可的一种方式，并且再次，你知道，能够获得可能帮助他们的资源。但是所有这些变化，诊断的增加以及意识的真正提高，所有这些最终都给自闭症社区本身带来了许多意想不到的后果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it actually becomes a way for them to be validated and again, you know, be able to access resources that might be able to help them. But all of these changes, the increase in diagnosis and and the really increased awareness, all of this ends up leading to a lot of unintended consequences for the autism community itself.</p>
</details>

### 诊断扩大化的意外后果：资源分配的困境

我们马上回来。阿津，在休息前你提到，被诊断为自闭症的人群扩大带来了意想不到的后果。请解释一下这些后果是什么。所以，虽然扩大“帐篷”确实为大量人群扩大了获得帮助的途径，但也带来了许多不同类型、需求各异的人。这引发了关于在资源有限的世界中，哪些需求应该优先的紧张局势。我们在两个非常大的领域看到了这一点。第一个是学校。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We'll be right back. So Azim, before the break, you mentioned that the widening group of people diagnosed with autism had unintended consequences. Explain what those were. So while broadening the tent did expand access to help for a huge number of people, it also brought in many different kinds of people with many different kinds of needs. And that has raised these tensions over which of those needs get prioritized in a world where there's a really limited pile of resources to help. And there's two really big areas where we see this. And the first is schools.</p>
</details>

你知道，我采访了很多有重度自闭症孩子的家庭，他们说，随着这些年来残疾程度较轻的儿童数量大幅增加，他们的孩子更难获得专门针对他们需求的学校服务。他们的孩子需要更多的帮助和支持才能度过一天。我采访了一些家长，他们说他们的孩子被多所学校开除。基本上，他们被告知，他们的孩子自闭症程度太高，不适合在专门为自闭症儿童设计的教室里学习。

<p class="english-text">you know I spoke with a lot of families who had kids with severe autism who said that as the number of kids with less severe disabilities has increased so much over the years. It's made it harder to access school services that are actually geared towards their kids. Their kids needing a lot more help and a lot more support to get through the day. I talked to parents who said that their kids had been kicked out of multiple schools. Basically, they're being told their kids are too autistic to be in the classrooms that are actually designated for kids with autism.</p>
</details>

我采访了另一位家长，她谈到不得不把儿子从一所学校接走，因为他有**走失行为**（eloping：指自闭症儿童或有认知障碍的人离开安全环境，可能导致危险），这是重度自闭症儿童的常见问题。而那所学校没有大门。那对他来说根本不是一个安全的环境。实际上，**全国重度自闭症委员会**（National Council for Severe Autism）进行了一项调查，他们发现，在他们调查的800名家长中，80%的人表示他们被告知自己的孩子甚至对于专门针对自闭症儿童的项目来说也过于具有破坏性。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I spoke with another parent who talked about having to actually pull her son out of a school where he was aloping, the word for running away, which is a common problem among kids with severe autism. And the school didn't have gates. It was just not a safe environment for him. Um, and there was actually a survey that was conducted by the National Council for Severe Autism that found that, you know, of the 800 parents that they surveyed, 80% said that they had been told that their kid was actually too disruptive even for programs that were geared towards kids with autism.</p>
</details>

所以这些家庭非常沮丧，因为资源池的扩张速度跟不上自闭症儿童数量的扩张速度。他们实际上发现，为孩子获得所需帮助变得更加困难，而他们的孩子需要大量的帮助。这里让我感到震惊的是，多年的努力旨在消除自闭症的污名化，而最终结果是，越来越多的人被纳入社会的各个方面，被纳入学校，被纳入课堂，更自豪地公开谈论自己的状况。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So, these families are really frustrated because the pool of resources is not expanding at the same rate as the number of children with autism is expanding. and they're actually finding it harder to get the help that they need for their kids and their kids need a lot of help. What is striking me here is that years of work went into dstigmatizing autism and the end result of that is that you have people increasingly being included in different aspects of society, included in schools, included in classes, being prouder to talk openly about their condition.</p>
</details>

然而，这也意味着更多的人在争夺有限的资源。讽刺的是，其净效应似乎是，需求最严重的学生被排除在教室等场所之外，正如你所提到的，因为他们被告知我们根本没有资源在这种环境中支持你，你需要去其他地方。是的，绝对是。我从无数重度自闭症儿童的家长那里听到了这样的说法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, that has also meant more people competing for a finite number of resources. And the irony of this is that the net effect seems to be that the students with the most severe needs are being excluded from places like the classroom as you mentioned because they are being told we simply do not have the resources to support you in this environment and you're going to need to go elsewhere. Yeah, absolutely. And I've heard that from countless parents of kids with severe autism.</p>
</details>

在自闭症研究方面，我们也看到了非常相似的情况。尽管每年用于自闭症研究的资金大幅增长，但我们实际上看到，专注于重度障碍人群的研究却减少了。我采访了波士顿的一位儿童精神病医生，他实际上对1991年至2013年间的所有治疗研究进行了回顾，他发现，包含重度自闭症参与者的研究比例从约95%下降到仅35%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we've seen a really similar thing play out in terms of autism research. Even as the amount of money that has gone towards researching autism has grown substantially year-over-year, we've actually seen a decrease in studies that are focused on people with the most severe impairments. I spoke with a child psychiatrist in Boston who actually did a review of all treatment studies from 1991 to 2013 and he found that the proportion of studies that included participants with severe autism declined from something like 95% of the studies to just 35%.</p>
</details>

这受到一些非常实际的因素和对研究方法的一种观点的影响。你知道，一个患有严重**重度自闭症**（profound autism：指自闭症谱系中最严重的一端，患者通常伴有严重的智力障碍、语言障碍和需要全天候照护）的人无法上网填写调查问卷。你知道，获取大量人群数据的一个非常简单的方法就是让他们填写在线调查问卷。他们也无法在一个持续嗡嗡作响的脑部扫描仪中坐上一个小时。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And this is being driven by some very sort of logistical factors and a sort of perspective on how this research should be approached. You know, a person with severe profound autism can't go online and fill out a survey. You know, that's a really easy way to get data on large groups of people is to have them fill out online surveys. They also can't go sit in a brain scan machine that is loudly humming for an hour.</p>
</details>

同时，围绕自闭症患者生活的研究重点已经从寻求自闭症的治愈或治疗的问题，转向对谱系较轻一端的人群更为重要的问题和关注，比如心理健康或就业问题。你知道，我采访的重度自闭症儿童的家长说，这些担忧与他们孩子的生活没有任何关系。你知道，他们的孩子正在与进食或学习说话等问题作斗争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And at the same time, the research priorities around autistic people's lives have moved away from the sort of questions that are seeking a cure or or a treatment for autism and more towards the sorts of questions and concerns that are of a lot more importance to people on the milder end of the spectrum. So questions around mental health or or employment. And you know, the parents of the severely autistic kids who I spoke with said those concerns do not relate in any way to their kids' lives. You know, their kids are struggling with things like eating or or learning how to talk,</p>
</details>

对吧？就业对这些家庭来说不是一个选择。他们有不同的担忧。对于他们中的许多人来说，确实不是。所以，将这群人归为一类导致了在如何解决这些问题上的许多分歧。听起来你所描述的许多讨论实际上并不是关于试图理解自闭症是什么。它实际上是关于这些分类为家庭解锁了什么样的资源。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right? Employment is not going to be an option for these families. They have different concerns. For a lot of them, it won't be. So, this group being lumped together has led to a lot of disagreements over how to approach these problems. It sounds like a lot of the discussion that you're describing is actually not about trying to understand what autism is. It's actually about what kind of resources those designations unlock for families.</p>
</details>

我可以想象这可能会让家庭之间相互对立。这是否有点过头了？不，我认为这绝对是一种正在发生的情况。我认为社区内部的分界线比这更复杂，因为现在是重度自闭症儿童的家长与自闭症患者本身的自我倡导者之间存在分歧，后者说，你知道，作为自闭症社区的成员，我们有你无法理解的共同经历。我认为这确实是这个社区中一个非常困难的动态，即当存在如此广泛的需求时，谁能代表社区发言，而谱系最严重一端的人往往无法为自己发言。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I can imagine that that could maybe pit families against one another. Is that going a step too far? No, I think that is definitely a dynamic that is playing out. I think the dividing line in the community is a little more complicated than that too in that it's really these parents of the kids with severe autism who are now at odds with activists who are self- advocates who are autistic people themselves who say you know we have a shared experience as members of the autistic community that you can't understand and I think that is a really difficult dynamic that has played out in this community is who gets to speak for the community when there are such broad needs and the people on the most severe end of the spectrum often cannot speak for themselves.</p>

### 重新审视诊断：重度自闭症的提议

凯西，在你自己的实践中是否有那么一个时刻，你意识到这种扩张可能存在负面影响？比如这正在产生一些我们没有预料到的负面后果。是的，我想是的。凯西在委员会中也有这样的经历，他们正在讨论自闭症患者的住房问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Kathy, was there sort of a moment in your own practice where you realized there might have been a downside to this expansion? Like this is having some negative consequences that we didn't prepare ourselves for. Yes, I I think so. And Kathy has this experience as well on a committee where they are discussing housing for autistic people.</p>
</details>

有一个自闭症自我倡导者，还有一群来自不同机构的人。她和一位自闭症自我倡导者在委员会中，这位倡导者强烈反对**集体之家**（group homes：为需要支持的残疾人提供共同居住和照护的住所）的理念，认为这基本上是把我们带回了精神病机构化的黑暗时代，而我们已经真正摆脱了那个时代。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there was an autism self- advocate and then a bunch of other people from different agencies. and she is on the committee with an autistic self- advocate who is really pushing against the idea of group homes, arguing that basically it's taking us back to the dark days of psychiatric institutionalization that we've really moved away from.</p>
</details>

当我说集体之家时，我想到的是四五个人住在一所房子里，还有另外两个人帮助照顾他们。她有了这个认识。我觉得他们不明白这些人无处可住，只能和他们年迈的父母住在一起，而父母已经无法照顾他们了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When I say group home, I'm thinking of like four or five people who live in a house with like two other people who are helping take care of them. And she has this realization. I felt like they didn't understand that these are people that have nowhere to live except with their parents who are getting older and can't take care of them.</p>
</details>

她觉得这位自我倡导者不明白这是为了那些需求最严重、需要全天候照护、无法独立生活的人。但我认为，他们将自闭症描绘成仿佛他们是所有形式自闭症的专家，这确实让我难以接受，我不会忘记。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">She felt like that the self- advocate did not understand that this is for people who have the most severe needs, who do need roundthe-clock care, who cannot live independently. But I think the idea that they were representing autism as if they were experts on all forms of autism, that was certainly something that I had a hard time with that I won't forget.</p>
</details>

她谈到那次经历如何让她真正担忧谁能代表自闭症的经历发言，谁能为这个社区做出选择，谁能被代表，谁能获得资源，这些都因为这个诊断所包含的经验范围变得如此之广而变得更加困难。那么，当凯西看到这些意想不到的后果正在发生时，她认为解决方案是什么？你能谈谈**重度自闭症**（profound autism：指自闭症谱系中最严重的一端，患者通常伴有严重的智力障碍、语言障碍和需要全天候照护）这个类别的提议吗？它是何时出现的，以及你对此的参与。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And she talks about how that experience really made her worry about who gets to speak for the experience of autism, who gets to make choices for that community, who gets represented, who gets resources has been made much more difficult by just how broad the range of experience contained in this diagnosis has now become. So, as Kathy sees these unintended consequences playing out, what does she see as the solution? Can you talk about the the proposal of this category of profound autism? Sort of when that came to be and then obviously your involvement in it, too.</p>
</details>

是的。我的意思是，柳叶刀杂志为我们提供了一个机会，成立一个跨学科的国际委员会。凯西和一群其他研究人员、临床医生和自闭症倡导者在过去几年里一直在提议，也许需要为那些有最严重残疾的人设立一个单独的类别。所以她在2021年领导了这个名为**柳叶刀委员会**（Lancet Commission：由国际医学期刊《柳叶刀》发起或支持的专家委员会，旨在就特定健康问题提供权威报告和建议）的项目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, we were I mean, Lanced offered us the opportunity to set up an international commission across disciplines. Kathy and a group of other researchers and clinicians and autism advocates have actually been over the last several years proposing that perhaps there needs to be a separate category for the people with the most severe disabilities. So she in 2021 is leading this thing called the Lancet Commission.</p>
</details>

哇。所以基本上听起来她正在推翻她几十年来支持的扩大类别的努力。是的，在某种程度上。然后关于我们到底该如何称呼这个类别，有很多讨论。这群专家最终提议设立一个单独的类别，称为“重度自闭症”。他们将其定义为：语言能力极低或没有，或智商低于50，或两者兼有，并且需要24小时照护者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wow. So basically it sounds like she's undoing the work that she's backed for decades in order to broaden the category. Yes, in a way. And then there was a lot of discussion about what on earth we call this. What this group of experts ends up proposing is a separate category that is called profound autism. And the way they defined it is having minimal or no ability to speak or an IQ of less than 50 or both and requiring 24-hour access to a caregiver.</p>
</details>

所以，这确实是为了认识到这部分人群有非常严重的需求，并有一个标签，以便能够识别这群人。所以，本质上，在多年扩大这个定义之后，凯西现在提议再次将谱系划分开来。但是，将这另一群人分离出去，实际效果会是什么呢？首先，这并不是一个已经提出的实际诊断。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it's really about recognizing that there is a part of this population with very severe needs and and having a label so that that group of people can be identified. So, essentially after years of expanding this definition, Kathy is now proposing something that would chop up the spectrum once again. But what would the practical effect of that be of that cleaving off of one other group? First, this is not a actual diagnosis that has been proposed.</p>
</details>

“重度自闭症”是一个多年来在非正式使用中逐渐增多的标签。我经常听到临床医生使用它。我认为，拥有这个标签的最终原因归结为认可。也就是说，认可这是一个需求非常严重的个体群体。定义中包含的24小时照护需求，我认为，说明了很多问题。我认为由此产生的希望是，这将是一个能够获得更多服务的群体，这些服务是他们的家庭多年来一直努力为他们争取而未果的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Profound autism is a label that has casually grown in use over the years. I hear clinicians using it all the time. The reason to have this label, I think, ultimately boils down to recognition. So, recognition that this is a group of individuals with really severe needs. The roundthe-clock care being right there as part of the definition, I think, tells you a lot. And I think flowing out from that is the hope that this will be a group that will be able to get more in terms of the services that their families have really struggled to get for them over the years.</p>
</details>

但至少目前，即使他们将此划分为一个单独的类别，它也不会直接将资源导向那些最需要帮助的人。是的，我认为这当然是希望，但我不认为我们知道。而且，你知道，这肯定不清楚这是否会是一个神奇的解决方案，能够解决凯西和其他人已经发现的这些问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But for now at least, even if they were to cleave this off into a separate category, it's not like it would direct resources to some of these people that need it most. Yeah, I I think that's certainly the hope, but I don't think we know. And you know, it's definitely not clear that this is going to be a magic solution that fixes these issues that Kathy and others have identified.</p>
</details>

考虑到我们已经讨论过的所有这些后果，以及一些家长指出的资源分配不均，凯西是否认为扩大诊断是一个错误，特别是考虑到她现在正试图纠正其中的一些问题？我问她是否以任何方式后悔她在扩大诊断方面所扮演的角色。我确实认为这在某种程度上适得其反了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Given all of these consequences that we have talked about and this lopsided allocation of resources that some parents have pointed toward, does Kathy think it was a mistake to broaden the diagnosis just especially given that she's trying to undo some of that now? I asked her if she regretted in any way the sort of role that she played in expanding the diagnosis. I do think it has backfired to some degree.</p>
</details>

我认为人们普遍认识到，凯西当然也认识到，将所有东西都归入一个诊断之下并没有奏效。自闭症意识的整个理念，这些都是非常好的事情。但我确实认为，我们无意中促成了一种非常复杂的诊断。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think there's broad recognition and Kathy certainly also recognizes that folding everything under one diagnosis hasn't worked. The whole idea of autism awareness, those are things that are really good. But I do think that we have contributed unwittingly to having diagnosis that are very complicated.</p>
</details>

不清楚的是什么会奏效，什么会解决他们最初试图解决的问题，而不落下任何人。重度自闭症儿童的家长也许会因为拥有一个明确的诊断而感到满意，但这仍然留下许多需求广泛的人群。凯西也担心，我的意思是，我不知道该怎么办，你知道，如何解决这个问题，因为我认为解决方案不是线性的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is not clear is what will work and what will fix the problems that they were trying to solve for in the first place without leaving anyone behind. The parents of kids with profound autism maybe will be satisfied by having a distinct diagnosis, but that still leaves a lot of people with wide range of needs. Kathy is also worried about I mean I I don't know what to do, you know, how how to solve this because I think the solution is not linear.</p>
</details>

它不会是“你属于这一组，你属于那一组”。我的意思是，没有两组。我也不认为我们能就三组或四组达成一致。我还采访了自闭症自我倡导者，他们非常担心如果诊断被拆分，这会传递一个信息，即那些没有重度自闭症的人根本就没有自闭症。我认为人们真的担心这种支持会因此而丧失，然后我们会将谱系划分为“真正的自闭症”和“非真正的自闭症”人群。我认为这也是一个真正的担忧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's not going to be you're in this group, you're in that group there. I mean there there aren't two groups. I don't think we could agree on three groups or four groups. I also spoke with autistic self- advocates who are really worried about if the diagnosis is split apart. The message that that sends is that the people who don't have profound autism don't have autism at all. And I think there's a real fear about that support being lost that then we will be dividing the spectrum up into people with real autism and not real autism. And I think that's a real concern too.</p>
</details>

我们该如何前进？我不知道。凯西，非常感谢你抽出这么多时间，并向我们详细解释了这一切。不，谢谢你。这感觉有点像一个悲伤的讽刺，有那么多像凯西这样的人努力帮助人们，在这个过程中消除了自闭症诊断的污名，并扩大了它的含义，但这样做，他们现在担心这项工作可能伤害了那些最需要帮助的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do we how do we move forward? I I don't know. Kathy, thank you so much for taking all this time and for walking us through all of this. No, thank you. It feels a little bit like a sad irony that there have been so many people like Kathy who worked so hard to get people help and in the process destigmatized this diagnosis of autism and expanded what it means and in so doing they now fear that that work might have harmed some of the people who needed it most.</p>
</details>

而且，目前尚不清楚这个社区中每个人的真正解决方案会是什么样子。是的，你知道，为重度自闭症设立这个单独的类别，也许会解决我们一直在讨论的一些问题，但它仍然留下许多悬而未决的问题：残疾和差异之间的界限在哪里？谁应该代表这样一个广泛的社区发言？诊断何时有帮助？何时在某些情况下会造成伤害？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it is not clear what any real solution for everybody in this community could look like. Yeah, you know, having this separate category made for profound autism will maybe solve some of the problems that we've been talking about, but it still leaves a lot of unanswered questions about where's the line between a disability and a difference. Who should be speaking for a community that is as broad as this one? Where are diagnoses helpful? And where can they in some cases cause harm?</p>
</details>

我认为这些都是精神病学领域目前普遍面临的许多问题，而且我认为这些问题仍然没有答案。阿津，非常感谢你。是的，谢谢你邀请我。
