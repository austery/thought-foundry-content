title: 吴石案、白色恐怖与麦卡锡主义：冷战时期国共美三方历史交织
---

### 吴石案：国共内战后的关键共谍

**吴石**（Wu Shi: 中华民国高级将领，后被证实为中共间谍）是谁？如果说**郭汝瑰**（Guo Ruguai: 中华民国高级将领，国共内战期间中共间谍）是国共内战期间最著名的共谍，那么吴石就是1949年以后最著名的共谍。考虑到吴石早在1948年**徐蚌会战**（Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign: 亦称淮海战役，国共内战三大战役之一）时就开始谍报活动，称他是国民党历史上破坏力最大的共谍也无不可。
<details>

<p class="english-text">Who was Wu Shi? If Guo Ruguai was the most famous Communist spy during the Chinese Civil War, then Wu Shi was the most renowned Communist spy after 1949. Considering that Wu Shi began his intelligence activities as early as 1948 during the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign, also known as the Huaihai Campaign, it is also fair to say that he was the most destructive Communist spy in Kuomintang history.</p>
</details>

有人认为，吴石应该与**白色恐怖**（White Terror: 台湾在戒严时期对异议人士的政治压迫）那段历史做切割。然而，在禁书笔记看来，白色恐怖的政策目的就是为了反共，就是为了给美国的亚洲反共阵营交上**投名状**（Pledge of Allegiance: 比喻为加入某个团体或阵营所做的表忠心行为）。因此，国共内战失败、**麦卡锡主义**（McCarthyism: 20世纪50年代美国反共政治运动）、吴石案、韩战以及白色恐怖之间，并非孤立事件，而是一个历史因果链条。吴石和白色恐怖不能切割，硬性切割只会造成认知混乱。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some people believe that Wu Shi should be separated from the history of the White Terror. However, from the perspective of Forbidden Books Notes, the policy objective of the White Terror was to oppose communism, to serve as a pledge of allegiance to the U.S.-led anti-communist bloc in Asia. Therefore, the failure of the Chinese Civil War, McCarthyism, the Wu Shi case, the Korean War, and the White Terror are not isolated incidents but rather a chain of historical cause and effect. Wu Shi and the White Terror cannot be separated; forcibly doing so would lead to cognitive confusion.</p>

### 历史论述的对比：大陆与台湾

中国天安门广场上的**人民英雄纪念碑**（Monument to the People's Heroes: 纪念为中国革命和解放事业牺牲的英雄）碑文刻着这样一句话：“1919年以来，在人民解放战争和人民革命中牺牲的人民英雄永垂不朽。”这个纪念碑纪念的对象，不仅包括了在内战中牺牲的解放军，还包括了抗日战争中牺牲的国军将士。从**毛泽东**到**习近平**，历代中共领导人都曾去人民英雄纪念碑前鞠躬、默哀、悼念过。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The Monument to the People's Heroes in Beijing's Tiananmen Square bears an inscription: "Eternal glory to the people's heroes who sacrificed their lives in the people's war of liberation and the people's revolution since 1919." The monument commemorates not only the People's Liberation Army soldiers who died in the civil war but also the Kuomintang soldiers who sacrificed their lives in the War of Resistance Against Japan. From Mao Zedong to Xi Jinping, successive Chinese Communist Party leaders have bowed, observed a moment of silence, and mourned before the Monument to the People's Heroes.</p>
</details>

反观台湾，现在的政治人物在历史论述上全部都在炒短线。他们遇到难题时，就用“**异次元切割刀**”（Dimensional Cutting Knife: 比喻为不顾历史连贯性，强行将不利部分割裂开来的做法）切掉那些会让自己丢票的历史，只留下选战中能得分的历史。当需要吴石时，他就是白色恐怖的受难者；当不需要他时，他就是危害台湾国家安全的叛徒。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In contrast, political figures in Taiwan today are all focused on short-term gains in their historical narratives. When faced with difficulties, they use a "dimensional cutting knife" to sever parts of history that might cost them votes, retaining only what helps them in elections. When Wu Shi is needed, he is a victim of the White Terror; when he is not, he is a traitor who endangered Taiwan's national security.</p>
</details>

如果你站在负面立场去批判吴石，那就意味着你也认可白色恐怖是那个冷战年代的“**必要之恶**”（Necessary Evil: 指为了达成某个重要目标，不得不采取的负面或不道德的行动）。反过来说，如果你要反对白色恐怖，那首先就必须抛开冷战时的反共意识形态，以现代社会普世价值观的视角去看待吴石案。在现代文明社会中，间谍也有人权。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you criticize Wu Shi from a negative standpoint, it implies that you also accept the White Terror as a "necessary evil" of the Cold War era. Conversely, if you want to oppose the White Terror, you must first abandon the anti-communist ideology of the Cold War and view the Wu Shi case from the perspective of modern society's universal values. In a modern civilized society, spies also have human rights.</p>
</details>

2019年，台湾**监察院**（Control Yuan: 台湾的最高监察机关）官方已经认定，当年吴石案中的司法程序存在重大瑕疵。说“重大瑕疵”都算是客气的，当年吴石案怎么判，不就是**蒋介石**一句话的事情吗？今天，禁书笔记将以国共之外的第三方境外势力的角度，来解读吴石案这段历史。政治没有中立，历史没有旁观，别忘了先点赞，把这期节目加入你的YouTube个人中心。

<p class="english-text">In 2019, Taiwan's Control Yuan officially determined that there were significant flaws in the judicial procedures of the Wu Shi case back then. To say "significant flaws" is being polite; the verdict of the Wu Shi case was essentially Chiang Kai-shek's word, wasn't it? Today, Forbidden Books Notes will interpret the history of the Wu Shi case from the perspective of a third-party external force, beyond the KMT and CCP. Politics has no neutrality, and history has no bystanders. Don't forget to like this episode and add it to your YouTube personal center.</p>

### 吴石案始末与地缘政治背景

吴石在1949年随着国民党败退台湾，最高官至国防部参谋次长。他也是中共早在1947年就安插在南京政府高层内的最高级别间谍之一，中共方面给他的代号是“密使一号”，意味着这是中共最重要的一笔情报资产。当时与他对接的**女特务**（Female Agent: 特指从事间谍活动或秘密任务的女性）也非同小可，是中共的美女间谍**朱枫**。你一听她这个名字，就知道是个狠角色。中共当时网罗了一批左倾的知识女青年，稍加培训就可以变成朱枫这样的交际花。但反过来，国民党培养的女间谍却很难跑到延安给毛泽东做一碗爱心红烧肉。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wu Shi retreated to Taiwan with the Kuomintang in 1949, eventually rising to the rank of Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Ministry of National Defense. He was also one of the highest-ranking spies the CCP had planted in the upper echelons of the Nanjing government as early as 1947. The CCP's codename for him was "Special Envoy No. 1," signifying him as one of the CCP's most crucial intelligence assets. The female agent who liaised with him, Zhu Feng, was also extraordinary, a beautiful CCP spy. Just hearing her name, you know she was a formidable figure. The CCP at that time recruited a group of left-leaning intellectual young women, who, with a little training, could become socialites like Zhu Feng. Conversely, it would have been difficult for female spies trained by the Kuomintang to go to Yan'an and cook a loving braised pork for Mao Zedong.</p>
</details>

吴石来台湾后，将台湾的防务部署、作战计划等高级机密都一股脑地交给了女特务朱枫。朱枫再通过香港，把情报转送给了中共。1949年年底，现在唱从从容容的立委**王世坚**的父亲，为了追求学校的女生，无意中泄露了中共在台湾的一份地下报纸《**光明报**》。顺着《光明报》的线索，**保密局局长**（Director of the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics: 国民党政府的情报机构负责人）**毛人凤**抓到了中共在台湾的间谍**蔡孝乾**。最后顺着这条线，就查到了吴石和朱枫。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">After Wu Shi arrived in Taiwan, he handed over high-level secrets, such as Taiwan's defense deployments and operational plans, to the female agent Zhu Feng. Zhu Feng then transmitted the intelligence to the CCP via Hong Kong. At the end of 1949, the father of Wang Shijian, now a relaxed legislator, inadvertently leaked an underground CCP newspaper in Taiwan, "Guangming Daily," while pursuing a schoolgirl. Following the clues from "Guangming Daily," Mao Renfeng, Director of the Bureau of Investigation and Statistics, apprehended Cai Xiaoqian, a CCP spy in Taiwan. This trail ultimately led to Wu Shi and Zhu Feng.</p>
</details>

1950年年初，吴石在台湾被捕。朱枫此时已辗转逃回浙江舟山。当时浙江舟山还在国民党控制下，朱枫被国民党从浙江舟山抓回了台湾。其实再过几个月后，蒋介石就被迫把**汤恩伯**的部队从舟山撤回台湾了。自此，国军也就失去了在大陆的全部据点。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In early 1950, Wu Shi was arrested in Taiwan. Zhu Feng had by then managed to escape back to Zhoushan, Zhejiang. At that time, Zhoushan, Zhejiang, was still under Kuomintang control, and Zhu Feng was captured by the Kuomintang from Zhoushan and brought back to Taiwan. In fact, just a few months later, Chiang Kai-shek was forced to withdraw Tang Enbo's troops from Zhoushan back to Taiwan. From then on, the KMT military lost all its strongholds on the mainland.</p>
</details>

1950年6月，国军刚刚从舟山撤回来的时候，这时候**韩战**（Korean War: 1950-1953年朝鲜半岛爆发的国际冲突）还没有爆发，台湾这个孤岛似乎很快就会被共军攻占。**蒋经国**当时的一个讲法是“先挺过后面100天”。由此可见，1950年台湾的情势已经非常危急了。这个时候，重判吴石案就变成了蒋介石对内树立威信的一个最好手段。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In June 1950, when the KMT forces had just withdrawn from Zhoushan, the Korean War had not yet broken out, and it seemed that the isolated island of Taiwan would soon be captured by the Communist army. Chiang Ching-kuo's statement at the time was to "first survive the next 100 days." This shows that Taiwan's situation in 1950 was already extremely critical. At this point, a heavy sentence in the Wu Shi case became Chiang Kai-shek's best means to establish internal authority.</p>
</details>

1950年6月10日清晨，吴石和朱枫等4人在台北**马场町刑场**（Machangding Execution Ground: 台湾白色恐怖时期重要的政治犯刑场）被行刑枪决。行刑前，年近56岁的吴石挥笔写下绝命诗，感叹：“一生殚力唯忠善，如此收场亦太悲。”这句话意思是：他一生竭尽全力，只求忠诚和行善，最后却落得身败名裂的下场。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On the morning of June 10, 1950, Wu Shi, Zhu Feng, and two others were executed by firing squad at the Machangding Execution Ground in Taipei. Before his execution, Wu Shi, nearly 56 years old, penned a farewell poem, lamenting: "My life was dedicated solely to loyalty and goodness, yet such an end is too tragic." This means he had strived his entire life for loyalty and good deeds, only to meet a disgraced end.</p>
</details>

吴石被枪决后仅仅过去两个礼拜，**金日成**就冒险发动了韩战，彻底扭转了整个亚洲的地缘政治局势。在朝鲜战争爆发后，美国第七舰队进驻台湾海峡，美国恢复对台湾的军事援助。狂风暴雨中的蒋介石政权抓住了一根救命稻草。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just two weeks after Wu Shi's execution, Kim Il Sung risked launching the Korean War, which completely reversed the geopolitical situation in Asia. After the outbreak of the Korean War, the U.S. Seventh Fleet entered the Taiwan Strait, and the U.S. resumed military aid to Taiwan. The Chiang Kai-shek regime, caught in a storm, grasped a lifeline.</p>
</details>

### 白色恐怖的制度化与美国因素

美国从抗战时期就一直支持蒋介石政权，但国共内战末期，**杜鲁门政府**（Truman Administration: 1945-1953年美国总统哈里·S·杜鲁门领导的政府）已经对国民党内部的贪污腐败和派系内斗感到厌倦了。对国民党内斗历史感兴趣的观众，禁书笔记有一个关于国民党派系内斗的三集系列节目，大家可以先订阅本频道后自己去找找看。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The United States had supported the Chiang Kai-shek regime since the War of Resistance Against Japan, but by the end of the Chinese Civil War, the Truman administration had grown weary of the corruption and factional infighting within the Kuomintang. For viewers interested in the history of KMT infighting, Forbidden Books Notes has a three-part series on KMT factional struggles; you can subscribe to this channel and find it yourself.</p>
</details>

美国在韩战之前迫切希望从亚洲抽身。韩战发生后，虽然美国客观上需要台湾再次作为亚洲反共的支点，但蒋介石同时也要向美国证明自己有决心、有能力肃清中共对台湾的渗透。这个时候，白色恐怖就进入了下半场，从对内镇压**本省人**（Benshengren: 指1945年前已在台湾居住的汉族居民）叛乱，转变成了如何让台湾证明自己的反共价值。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Before the Korean War, the United States was eager to disengage from Asia. After the Korean War, although the U.S. objectively needed Taiwan to once again serve as a fulcrum for anti-communism in Asia, Chiang Kai-shek also needed to prove to the U.S. that he had the determination and ability to purge Communist infiltration in Taiwan. At this point, the White Terror entered its second phase, shifting from suppressing "Benshengren" rebellions internally to demonstrating Taiwan's anti-communist value.</p>
</details>

说实话，美国人根本就不关心本省人和**外省人**（Waishengren: 指1945年后从中国大陆迁居台湾的汉族居民）之间的冲突，有多少美国政治人物知道本省人外省人这个区别都很难说。美国关心的是台湾能否作为他主导的全球反共阵营中一个稳固的支点，而不是投入一大堆纳税人的美金后，台湾自己从内部瓦解了。所以这个时候，美国人就希望台湾的反共事业可以制度化、长期化。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">To be honest, Americans didn't care at all about the conflict between Benshengren and Waishengren; it's hard to say how many American politicians even knew the distinction between them. What the U.S. cared about was whether Taiwan could serve as a stable fulcrum in its global anti-communist bloc, rather than collapsing from within after a large investment of taxpayer dollars. Therefore, at this time, Americans hoped that Taiwan's anti-communist efforts could be institutionalized and long-term.</p>
</details>

二二八时期上半场的白色恐怖特征是混乱，缺乏法律秩序，逮捕时也没有逮捕状，枪决也不需要审判。相比之下，下半场的国家暴力就已经演变成了一个制度，明面上有全套的法律程序，包括逮捕、侦讯、起诉、判决，虽然看起来合法，但本质上还是暴政。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first half of the White Terror during the 228 Incident period was characterized by chaos and a lack of legal order, with arrests made without warrants and executions carried out without trials. In contrast, the state violence in the second half evolved into an institutionalized system, with a full set of legal procedures on the surface, including arrest, interrogation, indictment, and judgment. Although seemingly legal, it was essentially tyranny.</p>
</details>

下半场的白色恐怖法律体系有三个法律支柱，分别是1949年的《**戒严令**》（Martial Law Decree: 台湾在1949-1987年间实施的紧急状态法令）和《**惩治叛乱条例**》（Statute for the Punishment of Rebellion: 台湾戒严时期用于镇压叛乱的特别法），还有1950年的《**戡乱时期检肃匪谍条例**》（Regulations for the Purging of Spies during the Period of Communist Rebellion: 台湾戒严时期专门针对共谍的法律）。这些法律系统性地限制了集会、结社、言论等自由，将国安嫌疑人定义为叛徒。同时，政府还鼓励民众之间互相举报。《戡乱时期检肃匪谍条例》第14条规定，因匪谍案没收之财产，承办人员可得35%之奖金。这就为冤假错案打开了方便之门。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The legal system of the second half of the White Terror had three legal pillars: the 1949 "Martial Law Decree" and the "Statute for the Punishment of Rebellion," and the 1950 "Regulations for the Purging of Spies during the Period of Communist Rebellion." These laws systematically restricted freedoms of assembly, association, and speech, defining national security suspects as traitors. At the same time, the government encouraged mutual reporting among citizens. Article 14 of the "Regulations for the Purging of Spies during the Period of Communist Rebellion" stipulated that handling officers could receive 35% of the confiscated property in spy cases. This opened the door for wrongful convictions.</p>
</details>

1956年以前的审判采用“**会审制**”（Joint Trial System: 一种不公开、无上诉程序的秘密法庭审判制度），这是一个不公开的秘密法庭，没有上诉程序，说你有罪就是有罪。1956年后，国防部仍然是最高军事审判机关。蒋介石作为三军领袖，拥有最高军事司法覆议权。经过蒋介石覆议的案件，有八成以上加重刑期，其中三成改判死刑。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Trials before 1956 adopted a "joint trial system," which was a closed-door secret court with no appeal process; if you were declared guilty, you were guilty. After 1956, the Ministry of National Defense remained the highest military judicial authority. As the leader of the armed forces, Chiang Kai-shek held the supreme military judicial review power. Over 80% of cases reviewed by Chiang Kai-shek resulted in harsher sentences, with 30% being changed to death sentences.</p>
</details>

在所有的法律工具中，最可怕的就是《惩治叛乱条例》第二条第一项，简称“**二条一**”（Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Statute for the Punishment of Rebellion: 台湾戒严时期用于惩治叛乱的严苛条款）。“二条一”的核心内容是，它规定了只要触犯**刑法第100条**（Article 100 of the Criminal Code: 台湾刑法中关于内乱罪的条款），就会被判处死刑。这个100条又是什么呢？是“意图破坏**国体**（National Polity: 国家政权组织形式）”、“变更**国宪**（National Constitution: 国家根本大法）”。什么叫“意图”，那解释起来就很灵活了。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Among all legal tools, the most terrifying was Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the "Statute for the Punishment of Rebellion," abbreviated as "Article 2-1." The core content of Article 2-1 stipulated that anyone who violated Article 100 of the Criminal Code would be sentenced to death. What is Article 100? It refers to "intending to undermine the national polity" or "altering the national constitution." What constitutes "intent" could be interpreted very flexibly.</p>
</details>

“二条一”的恐怖之处就在于这个最终解释权。比如撰写文章、发表不同政见、阅读禁书、参加读书会，甚至是订阅禁书笔记这种违禁YouTube频道，那都算是意图谋反，最高可以判死刑。“二条一”实际上就是一个莫须有的思想罪，它将国家镇压的重点从实际发生的间谍或者叛乱行为，转向了审判政治异端。这就使得国民党政权可以用反共的借口，铲除所有潜在的异议分子、左翼同情者，或者是本省的台独支持者，无论他们是否真正构成了武力威胁，都一律法办。这种恐怖统治一直持续到了1987年**解严**（Lifting of Martial Law: 台湾于1987年解除戒严，结束了长期的军事管制）。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The terror of "Article 2-1" lay in this ultimate power of interpretation. For example, writing articles, expressing dissenting political views, reading banned books, participating in reading clubs, or even subscribing to prohibited YouTube channels like Forbidden Books Notes, could all be considered intentions to rebel, punishable by death. Article 2-1 was essentially a baseless thought crime, shifting the focus of state suppression from actual espionage or rebellious acts to prosecuting political dissidents. This allowed the Kuomintang regime to use anti-communist pretexts to eliminate all potential dissidents, left-wing sympathizers, or local Taiwanese independence supporters, regardless of whether they truly posed a military threat, prosecuting them all. This reign of terror continued until the lifting of martial law in 1987.</p>
</details>

大陆观众可能不理解，为什么前一阵几个蹭武统热点的**陆配网红**（Mainland Chinese Spousal Internet Celebrities: 指嫁到台湾的中国大陆配偶成为网络红人）就能引发台湾社会那么大争论。其实大家在争的，就是这几个阿猫阿狗在抖音上的言论，到底有没有真正危害到台湾的国家安全或社会安定。民进党政府认为是有，说你有就是有，所以民进党就根据危害国家安全来处理这件事。这就让一部分台湾民众回忆起戒严时期的“二条一”。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mainland Chinese viewers might not understand why a few "Mainland Chinese spousal internet celebrities" who recently capitalized on the "unification by force" trend could spark such a huge debate in Taiwanese society. In reality, the debate centers on whether the remarks made by these individuals on TikTok genuinely endangered Taiwan's national security or social stability. The Democratic Progressive Party government believes they did, asserting that if they say you did, you did, and thus the DPP handled the matter based on national security concerns. This reminded some Taiwanese citizens of "Article 2-1" from the martial law era.</p>
</details>

### 美国麦卡锡主义：远东政策的清洗

最后，我们来看一下美国当时的**红色恐怖**（Red Scare: 指对共产主义或社会主义的广泛恐惧和镇压），即**麦卡锡主义**（McCarthyism: 20世纪50年代美国反共政治运动），一场和吴石案同时发生在美国的反共政治猎巫。与台湾的白色恐怖集中于肃清内部匪谍不同，麦卡锡主义的一个核心攻击点是集中攻击在杜鲁门政府内的外交政策专家，特别是那些负责远东事务的技术官僚。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Finally, let's look at the "Red Scare" in the United States at the time, namely McCarthyism, an anti-communist political witch hunt that occurred simultaneously with the Wu Shi case in the U.S. Unlike Taiwan's White Terror, which focused on purging internal Communist spies, a core target of McCarthyism was attacking foreign policy experts within the Truman administration, especially technocrats responsible for Far Eastern affairs.</p>
</details>

1949年中共在内战中的胜利，在美国历史中被称为“我们失去了中国”。这个失败被参议员**约瑟夫·麦卡锡**（Joseph McCarthy: 20世纪50年代美国参议员，以反共言论闻名）归咎于美国国务院内部存在着大量的共产主义同情者（communist sympathizers）。麦卡锡指控说，这些人蓄意破坏美国政府。杜鲁门虽然公开反驳说麦卡锡是“散播恐慌的煽动者”，但是因为美国在亚洲确实接连失败，当时的社会舆论已经被恐怖情绪主导了，政府在媒体声量上完全处于下风。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The CCP's victory in the civil war in 1949 is known in American history as "the loss of China." This failure was attributed by Senator Joseph McCarthy to the presence of numerous communist sympathizers within the U.S. Department of State. McCarthy accused these individuals of deliberately undermining the U.S. government. Although Truman publicly refuted McCarthy, calling him a "fear-mongering demagogue," the U.S. had indeed suffered successive failures in Asia, and public opinion at the time was dominated by fear, leaving the government at a complete disadvantage in terms of media presence.</p>
</details>

在同一时期，蒋介石在忙着抓共谍，麦卡锡则在美国散布红色恐怖阴谋论。麦卡锡主义清洗的主要受害者是美国国务院中一批经验丰富、真正了解中国的外交官，他们被称为“**中国通**”（China Hands: 指对中国文化、历史和政治有深入了解的美国外交官和学者）。比如美国历史上著名的汉学家、哈佛大学教授**费正清**（John Fairbank: 著名美国汉学家，哈佛大学教授），就是麦卡锡主义迫害的目标之一。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">During the same period, Chiang Kai-shek was busy apprehending Communist spies, while McCarthy spread Red Scare conspiracy theories in the United States. The primary victims of McCarthyism's purges were a group of experienced diplomats in the U.S. Department of State who truly understood China, known as "China Hands." For example, John Fairbank, a famous American sinologist and Harvard University professor, was one of the targets of McCarthyism's persecution.</p>
</details>

在麦卡锡主义者的偏执逻辑下，这些中国通到底犯了什么罪呢？很简单，就两条。第一，作为其外交职责的一部分，他们曾在二战期间代表美国政府与延安的中共政权有过接触。第二，他们利用自己的专业知识，在国共内战期间准确预测了国民党政权的军事和政治崩溃。在麦卡锡主义的偏执逻辑下，准确预测了中共的胜利被扭曲成为“希望中共胜利”。这些科学、理性、务实的中国通，因此被怀疑对美国国家不忠，被打成了中共同路人。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Under the paranoid logic of McCarthyism, what crimes did these China Hands commit? Simply put, there were two. First, as part of their diplomatic duties, they had contact with the CCP regime in Yan'an during World War II on behalf of the U.S. government. Second, they used their expertise to accurately predict the military and political collapse of the Kuomintang regime during the Chinese Civil War. Under McCarthyism's paranoid logic, accurately predicting the CCP's victory was twisted into "hoping for the CCP's victory." These scientific, rational, and pragmatic China Hands were therefore suspected of disloyalty to the United States and branded as Communist sympathizers.</p>
</details>

经过麦卡锡主义的清洗，到了1950年，美国国务院的22名核心中国通里面，大部分人都被解雇或者被调离岗位，只有两个人还在处理中国事务。当时美国的《**时代杂志**》（Time Magazine: 美国著名新闻周刊）就指出，这场清洗运动在美国亚洲政策制定层中制造了一个巨大的知识真空。谁能填补这个真空，谁就可以获得政策话语权。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">After the McCarthyist purges, by 1950, most of the 22 core China Hands in the U.S. Department of State had been fired or reassigned, with only two remaining to handle Chinese affairs. "Time Magazine" at the time pointed out that this purge created a huge knowledge vacuum in the U.S. Asian policy-making circles. Whoever could fill this vacuum would gain policy discourse power.</p>
</details>

在中国通被清洗的同时，华盛顿的另一股力量——**中国游说团**（The China Lobby: 旨在影响美国对华政策的非正式团体）正日益壮大。中国游说团是一个国民党政府代表和同情台湾的美国政治人物组成的非正式网络。这个团体的最初目标是在二战和中国内战期间为国民党争取到更多的美国军事和经济援助。到了冷战时期，他们的核心论述就变成了将中国内战定义为美国对抗国际共产主义全球斗争的一部分，而不是发生在遥远东方的一场亚洲国家内战。
<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">While the China Hands were being purged, another force in Washington, "The China Lobby," was growing. The China Lobby was an informal network composed of Kuomintang government representatives and American politicians sympathetic to Taiwan. The group's initial goal was to secure more U.S. military and economic aid for the Kuomintang during World War II and the Chinese Civil War. By the Cold War, their core narrative shifted to defining the Chinese Civil War as part of the U.S.'s global struggle against international communism, rather than an Asian civil war occurring in the distant East.</p>

当1950年6月25日韩战爆发后，杜鲁门政府急需一份东亚政策。此时，华盛顿内部那些中国通专业官僚已经被麦卡锡扫地出门了，剩下的就只有中国游说团的声音。他们把残忍但高效的蒋介石政权推上了亚洲反共的舞台。蒋介石则通过白色恐怖来证明自己的反共价值。

<p class="english-text">When the Korean War broke out on June 25, 1950, the Truman administration urgently needed an East Asia policy. At this point, the professional China Hands bureaucrats within Washington had been swept out by McCarthy, leaving only the voice of The China Lobby. They propelled the ruthless but efficient Chiang Kai-shek regime onto the stage of anti-communism in Asia. Chiang Kai-shek, in turn, used the White Terror to prove his anti-communist value.</p>

通过对吴石案的高调处置，蒋介石重新塑造了国民党政权的形象，从一个很容易被共产党渗透的松散政党，转换为一个残忍但高效的**列宁式政党**（Leninist Party: 指以列宁主义为指导，强调高度集中、纪律严明和先锋队作用的政党）。吴石案也确实对台湾内部民众证明了是真的有共谍，是真的有中共同路人，所以白色恐怖就借此大行其道，在台湾社会延续的时间长达40年。吴石一条命，换来了台湾40年密不透风的社会控制。

<p class="english-text">Through the high-profile handling of the Wu Shi case, Chiang Kai-shek reshaped the image of the Kuomintang regime, transforming it from a loose party easily infiltrated by the Communist Party into a ruthless but efficient Leninist party. The Wu Shi case indeed proved to the Taiwanese public that Communist spies and sympathizers truly existed, which allowed the White Terror to flourish and persist in Taiwanese society for 40 years. Wu Shi's life was exchanged for 40 years of airtight social control in Taiwan.</p>

### 当代台湾的“共谍”争议

禁书笔记认为，现在台湾已经没有那么多共谍了，大部分都是小鱼两三只，因为现在的**人民解放军**和当年**古宁头**（Guningtou: 1949年国共内战末期在金门岛发生的一场重要战役）的解放军已经不同了。现在两岸军力差距巨大，中共最大的敌人早就不是台湾，而是美国了。对美国的情报渗透才是中共现在最重要的工作。

<p class="english-text">Forbidden Books Notes believes that there are not many Communist spies in Taiwan now; most are just small fry, because the current People's Liberation Army is different from the PLA at Guningtou back then. The military disparity across the Taiwan Strait is now huge, and the CCP's biggest enemy is no longer Taiwan, but the United States. Intelligence infiltration against the U.S. is now the CCP's most important work.</p>

台湾最近20年抓共谍抓来抓去，抓到的最大咖是谁呢？和吴石一样，也是一个中将。这个叫做**高安国**的退役中将，涉嫌收受中国资金，在台湾建立一个叫做“**反独促统联军**”（Anti-Independence and Pro-Unification Alliance: 台湾一个被指控接受大陆资金，旨在推动统一并反对台独的组织）的武装组织，企图为解放军登陆时做内应。然后整个事件中，反独促统联军一共收了多少资金呢？一共6个人瓜分了总共100万人民币的预算，相当于435万台币、14万美金。就这点钱，连维持一个黑社会组织都困难。这个反独促统联军有什么实际的武装能力啊？更像是一个诈骗集团的套路，400万台币做一个诈骗的项目倒是足够了，行骗的目标就是中共呗。

<p class="english-text">Who is the biggest "Communist spy" caught in Taiwan in the past 20 years? Like Wu Shi, he was also a lieutenant general. This retired lieutenant general, named Gao Anguo, was suspected of receiving funds from China to establish an armed organization in Taiwan called the "Anti-Independence and Pro-Unification Alliance," aiming to act as an inside agent for the PLA during a landing. So, how much funding did the Anti-Independence and Pro-Unification Alliance receive in this entire incident? A total of 6 people shared a budget of 1 million RMB, equivalent to 4.35 million NTD or 140,000 USD. With such a small amount of money, it would be difficult even to maintain a gangster organization. What actual armed capability does this Anti-Independence and Pro-Unification Alliance have? It seems more like a scam, 4 million NTD would be enough for a scam project, with the CCP as the target of the deception.</p>
