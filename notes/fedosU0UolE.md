title: 收盘分析：贸易担忧、银行财报与市场波动
---

### 市场收盘概览与贸易紧张局势

All right. We are about 2 minutes away from the end of the trading day. Katie Greifeld and Matt Miller, in for Romaine Bostick, are here to help take us through the closing bell. We're joined by a global simulcast, Carol Massar and Isobel, filling in for Tim Stenovec. Carol, we were just talking about how we were so close to seeing another green finish for the S&P 500, but those trade tensions coming back in a big way just in the last 15 minutes or so.

好的。距离交易日结束还有大约两分钟。凯蒂·格雷菲尔德和马特·米勒（他代替罗曼·博斯蒂克出席）将带我们了解收盘情况。全球同步直播连线了卡罗尔·马萨尔和伊莎贝尔（她代替蒂姆·斯特诺维克出席）。卡罗尔，我们刚才还在讨论，**标普500指数**（S&P 500: 由标准普尔公司编制的、衡量美国500家大型上市公司股票表现的指数）差点就能再次以上涨收盘，但在过去的15分钟左右，贸易紧张局势又大幅升温。

Carol: Yeah, the president putting out on our show about soybeans and China. And so the tit for tat continues.

卡罗尔：是的，总统在我们的节目中提到了大豆和中国。所以这种针锋相对的局面还在继续。

Katie: Yeah, keeping an eye on that.

凯蒂：是的，我们会持续关注。

### 银行股表现与加密货币下跌

Katie: Having said that, guys, with big banks starting to report, not everybody got a warm reception on Wall Street. You do see the KBW bank index up about 1.7%. So we are seeing some outperformance as a whole when it comes to the bank names.

凯蒂：话虽如此，各位，随着大型银行开始发布财报，并非所有银行都在华尔街受到热烈欢迎。你们确实看到**KBW银行指数**（KBW Bank Index: 衡量美国主要银行股表现的指数）上涨了约1.7%。因此，就银行股整体而言，我们看到了一些超预期的表现。

Katie: And I've been driving Carol crazy by talking about crypto all the time, but there is also red on the screen: Bitcoin is down by almost 3%. Ethereum is leading the broader downturn after Friday when the industry saw one of the worst sell-offs in history. They're also all down. It's basically red on the screen if you type CEO wipe go.

凯蒂：我一直和卡罗尔聊加密货币都快把她逼疯了，但屏幕上也有红色：**比特币**（Bitcoin: 一种去中心化的数字加密货币）下跌了近3%。在周五经历历史上最严重的抛售之一后，**以太坊**（Ethereum: 一种开源的、基于区块链的平台，其原生加密货币为Ether）正在引领更广泛的下跌。它们也都下跌了。如果你输入“CEO wipe go”，屏幕上基本上就是一片红色。

### 黄金上涨与市场指数回顾

Matt: That's interesting. You do have gold actually rising, and I look at that because when you say Bitcoin, now I think debasement trade, but gold is actually up three quarters of 1%, so spot is at 4141, which if I'm not mistaken, would be yet another record high for the yellow metal. It has been just nuts trying to follow gold so far this year. I mean, you've had twin rallies when it comes to gold, when it comes to equities, and that's certainly what you're seeing today.

马特：这很有趣。黄金实际上是在上涨的，我之所以关注它，是因为当你提到比特币时，我现在会想到贬值交易，但黄金实际上上涨了0.75%，现货价格为4141美元，如果我没记错的话，这将是这种贵金属的又一个历史新高。今年迄今为止，追踪黄金走势简直是太疯狂了。我的意思是，在黄金和股票方面都出现了双重上涨，这正是你今天所看到的。

Katie: Or you had been relative for 15 sentiment anyway. The S&P 500, it will finish just slightly lower, just about a tenth of a percent. We are very close to all-time highs, even with that piece that we did see on Friday. The Nasdaq down a bit more, down about 7/10 of a percent when it comes to the Nasdaq. The Dow Jones, we look at that for some reason, higher by about half of a percent. It's a price-weighted index, so I don't know how much salt you want to put there. But in any case, Carol, it looks like we did see that decline, but very, very tepid losses overall.

凯蒂：或者你之前也曾相对15点情绪化。**标普500指数**最终将小幅下跌，跌幅约为0.1%。即使有周五我们看到的那一部分跌幅，我们仍然非常接近历史高点。**纳斯达克指数**跌幅稍大，下跌了约0.7%。**道琼斯指数**出于某种原因上涨了约0.5%。它是一个价格加权指数，所以我不知道你对此有多大的信心。但无论如何，卡罗尔，看起来我们确实看到了下跌，但总体而言，损失非常非常轻微。

Carol: Katie, hitting on the Dow. Again, I'm just going to put it out there. I know. I know. S&P 500. Let's go back there, folks, despite our down for the day overall. You look inside the index, Matt, and you've got 389 names actually in the S&P 500 gaining ground today, 113 to the downside, one unchanged.

卡罗尔：凯蒂，关于道琼斯指数。我再说一遍。我知道。我知道。各位，让我们回到**标普500指数**，尽管我们今天整体下跌。马特，你看看指数内部，你会发现标普500指数中有389只股票今天实际上是上涨的，113只下跌，1只持平。

### 华尔街实习经历与市场技术分析

Matt: I was a young buck doing my first Wall Street internship at Tucker Anthony.

马特：我年轻时在塔克·安东尼做我的第一次华尔街实习。

Katie: Tell me more. John Hancock coming back when the Dow crossed through 6000. What did you do? How do you celebrate?

凯蒂：多说点。道琼斯指数突破6000点时约翰·汉考克回来了。你做了什么？你怎么庆祝？

Matt: And you know what? I was the guy in the office. I was the kid who could use the Bloomberg terminal.

马特：你知道吗？我是办公室里那个孩子，会用**彭博终端**（Bloomberg Terminal: 一种计算机软件系统，投资者用它来访问实时金融市场数据、下达交易指令以及获取新闻和分析）。

Katie: Wow.

凯蒂：哇。

Matt: And so that was like my only skill, and I didn't do much else.

马特：所以那几乎是我唯一的技能，我没做太多其他事情。

Katie: They call you Maddie back then? I just called you Maddie on air.

凯蒂：他们那时叫你麦迪吗？我刚刚在节目里叫你麦迪了。

Matt: I don't think so. Here's the I map, which is a look at the industry group breakdown on the S&P 500. You can see that the tech stocks are not saving the day, down about one and a half percent. All of the index is only down by two tenths of 1%. So you did have more groups winning than losing. And as Carol points out, the financials are the biggest gainers, up about 1.2%, even though JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs both fell after earnings that beat analysts' estimates.

马特：我想不是。这是I-map，它展示了**标普500指数**的行业分组细分。你可以看到科技股并没有力挽狂澜，下跌了大约1.5%。整个指数只下跌了0.2%。所以，上涨的板块多于下跌的板块。正如卡罗尔所指出的，金融股是最大的赢家，上涨了约1.2%，尽管摩根大通和高盛在超出分析师预期的财报发布后都下跌了。

Katie: Right. Kind of impressive to see that.

凯蒂：没错。看到这种情况挺令人印象深刻的。

### 个股表现：银行与科技

Katie: All right. So let's get to Matt kind of setting me up really well. Let's get to some of the individual gainers, if I may. So we know that JPMorgan and Goldman not having such a great day and not getting such a warm reception on Wall Street. Having said that, Citigroup and Wells Fargo certainly did. They showed some outperformance. Citi at the close here, up 3.9%. Wells Fargo a gain of more than 7%, some real outperformance. Wells Fargo, by the way, the top gainer in the S&P 500 today. You did have them beating Wall Street revenue estimates across all five of its major business lines, total revenue jumping 9%.

凯蒂：好的。那么，马特为我做了很好的铺垫。如果可以的话，我们来谈谈一些个别上涨的股票。我们知道摩根大通和高盛今天表现不佳，在华尔街没有受到热烈欢迎。话虽如此，花旗集团和富国银行确实表现出色。它们显示出了一些超预期的表现。花旗收盘上涨3.9%。富国银行上涨超过7%，表现非常出色。顺便说一句，富国银行是今天标普500指数中涨幅最大的股票。它的五个主要业务线都超出了华尔街的营收预期，总营收增长了9%。

Katie: Markets, banking services. These companies are really some outperformance for Wells Fargo. We talked to Alison Williams here on Bloomberg Businessweek Daily. And, you know, finally, it seems like they are just kind of getting their house in order, and their metrics really impressive. And because we know that they've had a couple of years where it's been really, really tough. So anyway, real outperformance in those, and we get ready for some more big banks tomorrow.

凯蒂：市场、银行服务。富国银行在这些方面表现确实出色。我们在《彭博商业周刊日报》上采访了艾莉森·威廉姆斯。而且，你知道，他们似乎终于把内部事务处理好了，他们的指标也确实令人印象深刻。因为我们知道他们过去几年非常非常艰难。所以，无论如何，这些股票表现非常出色，我们准备迎接明天更多大型银行的财报。

Katie: Advanced Micro was up 4%, finishing the day with a gain of about 0.8%, top gainer in the stocks today. AMD coming out saying Oracle will deploy a large batch of its forthcoming AMD 1450 chips next year. So Oracle is going to put about 50,000 of those semiconductors and data center computers starting in the third quarter of 2026. So we've just seen a lot of announcements between chip companies and other companies involving AI.

凯蒂：**超微半导体**（Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., AMD: 一家全球领先的半导体公司）上涨了4%，收盘时上涨了约0.8%，是今天涨幅最大的股票。AMD宣布甲骨文明年将部署大量其即将推出的AMD 1450芯片。所以甲骨文将在2026年第三季度开始，将大约5万个这种半导体应用于数据中心计算机。因此，我们看到了许多芯片公司与其他涉及人工智能的公司的合作公告。

Matt: Even knows, like Black knows how much that is? 50,000. Is that a lot of chips or is that a little? I don't know, throwaway. We throw around these massive numbers. Right. About gigawatts of power, and I now I no longer know. 50,000 chips is a lot.

马特：甚至知道，就像布莱克知道那有多少吗？5万个。这是很多芯片还是很少？我不知道，随口一说。我们总是抛出这些巨大的数字。对。关于千兆瓦的电力，我现在也不知道了。5万个芯片是很多了。

Katie: It does make your head spin. I've just got to say, Ian King, I'm watching a monitor and he's just getting ready and set up and sitting down. We're going to actually ask that question to him in just a moment.

凯蒂：这确实让人头晕。我不得不说，伊恩·金，我正看着显示器，他正准备就绪坐下。我们稍后会把这个问题抛给他。

### 零售巨头沃尔玛与OpenAI合作

Katie: And Walmart, could I mention them up about 5% in today's session? Stock on pace. I think they closed maybe at a record high today, and that's after an announcement from the retail giant, which we will get to. More on that in just a moment.

凯蒂：还有沃尔玛，我可以说他们今天上涨了大约5%吗？股价正在加速。我想他们今天可能以创纪录的高点收盘，那是在这家零售巨头发布公告之后，我们稍后会详细介绍。稍后会提供更多信息。

Katie: This story we've been talking about here at Bloomberg: Walmart partnering with **OpenAI** (OpenAI: 一家致力于人工智能研究和部署的美国人工智能研究实验室和公司), who isn't partnering with OpenAI at this point, to offer shopping on **ChatGPT** (ChatGPT: OpenAI开发的一款基于人工智能的大型语言模型聊天机器人). So users will be able to basically shop Walmart's assortment directly on chatbots by clicking a buy button with the catalog, including apparel and or team at package food and other products. But I just do feel like we need to think about chatbots as just our new search engine or cloud record in Germany or like, right.

凯蒂：我们彭博社一直在讨论的这个故事：沃尔玛与**OpenAI**（OpenAI: 一家致力于人工智能研究和部署的美国人工智能研究实验室和公司）合作，现在谁不和OpenAI合作呢，在**ChatGPT**（ChatGPT: OpenAI开发的一款基于人工智能的大型语言模型聊天机器人）上提供购物服务。用户将能够通过点击购买按钮，直接在聊天机器人上购买沃尔玛的商品，商品目录包括服装、包装食品和其他产品。但我确实觉得我们需要把聊天机器人看作我们新的搜索引擎，或者像德国的云记录一样，对吧。

Isobel: My main gripe here is that fresh food isn't included in the offering, partly because consumers buy similar products weekly. But that's exactly why it should be. Because I do my shopping online, grocery shopping, and I forgot to order eggs last night. I mean, I want to remind me that every week you need to order eggs. So it's come it should include that it's coming. But I also use chat chip to cook. Do you not use do you not use it for recipes?

伊莎贝尔：我主要抱怨的是，这项服务不包括生鲜食品，部分原因是消费者每周都会购买类似的产品。但这正是它应该包含的原因。因为我在线上购物，购买杂货，昨晚我忘了订鸡蛋。我的意思是，我希望它能提醒我每周都需要订鸡蛋。所以它应该包含进来，它会来的。但我也会用聊天芯片做饭。你不用它来找食谱吗？

Matt: I don't cook or use Chat's helpful. So in that case, I agree with you as well. I will say it is amazing to see Walmart shares react so strongly to this news, closing up at a record high, up nearly 5%. If only OpenAI was a public company, we could check in on those shares as well. I would imagine they'd be skyrocketing.

马特：我不做饭，也不用聊天机器人帮忙。所以在那种情况下，我也同意你的看法。我要说的是，看到沃尔玛股价对这条消息反应如此强烈，收盘创历史新高，上涨近5%，真是令人惊讶。如果OpenAI是一家上市公司，我们也可以查看它的股价。我想它们会暴涨的。

### 蛋白质食品趋势与健康考量

Katie: But when you say fresh food, does that include Pop-Tarts? Oh, Doritos. I don't know if Pop-Tarts count as fresh food.

凯蒂：但是当你提到生鲜食品时，那包括Pop-Tarts吗？哦，多力多滋。我不知道Pop-Tarts算不算生鲜食品。

Isobel: Definitely not. Good news. They're going to have more protein. This is a really interesting story coming out of Céline over that is your Pop-Tart maker that apparently the new versions of Pop-Tarts will have ten grams of protein per serving in three different flavors, which is exciting for the subset of the population that is really into protein right now. I am among them. I don't know if I will be trying protein Pop-Tarts, but you saw Starbucks, for example, recently introduced protein lattes and protein cold foam. It's everywhere.

伊莎贝尔：肯定不算。好消息是，它们将含有更多的蛋白质。这是一个非常有趣的故事，来自Pop-Tart制造商Céline，显然新版Pop-Tarts每份将含有十克蛋白质，有三种不同口味，这对于目前非常热衷于蛋白质的人群来说是令人兴奋的。我就是其中之一。我不知道我是否会尝试蛋白质Pop-Tarts，但你看到星巴克最近也推出了蛋白质拿铁和蛋白质冷萃泡沫。它无处不在。

Matt: Have you tried a protein latte?

马特：你尝过蛋白质拿铁吗？

Isobel: Of course I have.

伊莎贝尔：当然尝过。

Matt: Is it too much money?

马特：太贵了吗？

Isobel: They're not bad. I have to say, this is dusty to me. I'm just going to point out in this story, it says that the sugar content will be similar to regular Pop-Tarts, which have about 30 grams of sugar per serving, depending on the flavor. That's roughly 60% of the recommended daily intake. So the health food, but 200 can look 200 calories a serving, ten grams of protein in 200 calories. That's pretty good relative to the benchmark, which is a normal Pop-Tarts.

伊莎贝尔：它们不赖。我不得不说，对我来说这有点过时了。我只想指出，这个故事中提到，糖含量将与普通Pop-Tarts相似，后者每份含有约30克糖，具体取决于口味。这大约是每日推荐摄入量的60%。所以，健康食品，但200卡路里一份，200卡路里中含有10克蛋白质。相对于普通Pop-Tarts这个基准来说，这已经相当不错了。

Matt: Not that. But it. Maybe we should get protein from real protein.

马特：不是那个。但是，也许我们应该从真正的蛋白质中获取蛋白质。

Isobel: Yeah, Maybe we should do it in those eggs that Isabella forgot to buy.

伊莎贝尔：是的，也许我们应该从伊莎贝尔忘了买的那些鸡蛋里获取。

Matt: Tuna. Like eggs.

马特：金枪鱼。像鸡蛋。

Isobel: Like eggs. Egg. Exactly. Thank you. Just going to say.

伊莎贝尔：像鸡蛋。鸡蛋。没错。谢谢。我只是想说。
