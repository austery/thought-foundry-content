### 课堂中的政治言论：挑战与应对

主持人: 教师和学生如何处理敏感议题的讨论？学校里是否存在政治偏见问题？我邀请了**安大略省中学教师联合会**（Ontario Secondary School Teachers Federation: 简称OSSTF，代表安大略省中学教师的工会）约克区主席Muna Kadri，以及刚毕业的高中生Sarah Mora，分享他们在学校谈论政治的经历。Muna、Sarah，非常感谢你们加入我们的节目，也感谢你们来到我们临时搭建的演播室。你们最近怎么样？

<p class="english-text">How do teachers and students handle discussing sensitive issues? Is political bias a problem in schools? I asked Muna Kadri, York Region president of the Ontario Secondary School Teachers Federation, and Sarah Mora, a recent high school graduate, to share what it's like to talk politics at school. Muna, Sarah, thank you so much for joining us on the program and thanks for joining us in our makeshift studio. How are you guys doing?</p>
</details>

Muna: 很好。谢谢你们邀请我们。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Great. Thank you for having us. It's wonderful. Thank you so much for having us.</p>
</details>

主持人: 好的，我们今天在这里讨论如何在课堂中处理政治言论。我想从教师的角度了解，教师们是否觉得在课堂上讨论某些内容时会受到限制？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so we're here to talk about sort of navigating political speech in the classroom. Um, I want to know from a teacher's perspective, do teachers feel a chill on what they can discuss in a classroom?</p>
</details>

Muna: 嗯，我们讨论的内容是受课程大纲指导的。所以，教育部会告诉我们要在课堂上讨论什么，但这取决于当时的社会氛围。举个例子，在**COVID**（Coronavirus Disease 2019: 2019冠状病毒病）期间，有一些两极分化的问题。课程大纲指导我们教学，但我们知道当社区出现外部问题时，会存在一些压力。因此，由于这些压力，处理某些问题变得很困难。但我们仍然必须教授课程大纲规定的内容，这就是我们所做的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, what we discuss is guided by curriculum? So, the ministry tells us what it is that we're discussing in the classroom, but depending on the climate. So, to give you an example, during COVID, there were some polarizing issues. The curriculum guides what we teach, but we know that there are some pressures when there's external issues in the community. And so it it's difficult to navigate some issues because of those pressures. But again, we still have to teach the curriculum and that's what we do.</p>
</details>

### 教师视角：课程、压力与批判性思维

主持人: 你提到了COVID作为一个例子。我很好奇，在政治上，这是一个非常有争议的时期。政治方面，你们如何处理像我们边境以南（美国）以及加拿大正在发生的一些重大事件？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You bring up CO as one example. I am curious um politically a very contentious time. Um politics, how do you navigate something as big as what we're seeing sort of south of the border and sort of what's happening here in Canada?</p>
</details>

Muna: 我们以课程大纲为基础。所以我还是会给出同样的答案。你提到现在是一个特别有争议的时期，这很有趣。你知道，我教书快20年了，每个时期都曾是特别有争议的时期。所以我们鼓励学生评估信息来源，批判性思考，并以课程大纲为基础。有时学生处理新材料会很困难，因为它们可能与他们从小到大的认知不完全一致。但当他们能够根据课程大纲的指导，体验新的思想和观点时，那是非常棒的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're grounded in curriculum. So I come back to the same answer and it's funny you say that right now is a particularly contentious time. You know I've been teaching for almost 20 years now. Every time was a particularly contentious time and so we encourage students to evaluate sources, think critically and we ground ourselves in the curriculum. So sometimes it's tough for students to deal with new materials because they are not particularly in line with what they've known for life. But it's great when they get to experience new thoughts and ideas based on what we are guided by through the curriculum. All right,</p>
</details>

### 学生视角：政治参与与健康辩论

主持人: 好的，Sarah。你现在已经高中毕业，正在上大学。但在高中时期，那些不一定完全属于课程大纲，也许只是与课程大纲相关的对话，你是如何处理和讨论的呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sarah. Now, you've graduated uh but uh and you're in university now, but what was it like in high school uh around sort of those conversations that weren't necessarily curriculum uh maybe curriculum adjacent perhaps, but how did you sort of navigate those conversations and how would you talk about them in the classroom?</p>
</details>

Sarah: 这是一个非常好的问题，我认为你们两位都提出了很好的观点。就像每个时期都是一个特别有争议的时期一样，政治上总会有事情发生，总会有冲突或危机。我的意思是，教育本身就具有固有的政治性。所以，即使是在如何与学生沟通等方面做出决定，那本身就是政治性的。我认为我个人比我的一些同学更倾向于政治。所以，当我在历史、地理或经济学等课程中时，这绝对是我高中时期关注的重点。我很感激能遇到那些非常乐于促进这类对话的老师。例如，去年美国大选期间，我担任历史社团的负责人。所以我们组织了一次课后讲座，内容是关于美国政治如何运作，美国大选如何运作，以及对这次选举的预期。我的历史老师实际上是主讲人，他非常乐于进行这些对话。我认为所有这些对话中最重要的是，你必须认识到你无法将自己与偏见分开。但同样，学习如何批判性思考，这绝对是我的所有老师都做得非常出色的一点，他们会指出，你知道，努力将偏见与我们赋予这些事物的价值分开，并在一个非常主观的背景下，尽可能地给我们最客观的立场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's a really great question and I think that like both of you guys made really good points. Like every every time is like a particularly contentious time. there's always going to be something going on politically and some conflict or crisis and I mean like education itself is inherently political. So even making decisions within um how you communicate with your students and things like that that is inherently political. Um I I think that I am a more particularly politically um oriented person than some of my classmates. So that was definitely something that I focused on in high school when I was in uh classes like history or geography or economics that was definitely at the forefront of my mind. Um I think I was I'm very grateful to have had teachers who were very open to fostering these kinds of conversations. Um during the US election for example um last year I was um like head of the history club. So we organized um a kind of lesson after school about how US politics works, how the election works in the US um and what to expect for this election. And my history teacher actually was the one who led it and he was very open to these conversations. And I think that what was most important about all of those conversations is that you recognize that you can't separate yourself from bias. But again, like learning how to think critically, that is definitely something that all of my teachers did a really great job at pointing out, you know, like trying to um separate the bias from the value that we ascribe to these things and and just giving us the most um objective stance in a very subjective um landscape.</p>

### 政治言论的界限与教育部的备忘录

主持人: Muna，我想了解一下，是否有教师因为在课堂上的政治言论而受到纪律处分？**OSSTF**又是如何提供帮助的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Muna, I want to understand, have there been teachers who have been disciplined um for, you know, political speech in the classroom and how has the OSTF helped?</p>
</details>

Muna: 嗯，我无法就安大略省的纪律处分和我们对纪律的定义发表评论，但我们是否与教师就课堂上被视为政治言论的问题进行过讨论？我认为你提出了一个很好的观点，那就是一切都是政治性的。因此，就我们**OSSTF**的角色而言，我们支持教师如何在某个话题可能具有挑战性的时候处理课程大纲。我将告诉你，在约克区支持3500名会员的经验，他们都在努力做到正确，以帮助学生做出自己的决定，帮助学生评估资源，帮助学生处理困难的对话。所以，就像你说的，在不同时期，不同问题上会有一种寒蝉效应，我们作为联合会的角色是帮助我们的同事以最佳方式支持学生来完成课程大纲。你可以看到坐在我旁边的这位学生就是这种努力的成果，她正在做着令人难以置信的工作，部分原因就是她在公共教育环境中接受的教育。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I I can't speak to all of Ontario in terms of discipline and our definitions of discipline, but have there been conversations with teachers about concerns about what is deemed political speech in the classroom? And so I think you brought up a great point is everything is political. And so in terms of our role as OSSTF, we support teachers in terms of how do you navigate curriculum during times where a topic might be challenging. And I'm going to tell you from supporting 3,500 members in York Region. They're all trying to get it right in terms of helping students make their own decisions, helping students assess resources, helping students navigate difficult conversations. And so, while like you said, there's a chill at different times over different issues, our role as a federation is to help our colleagues work through the curriculum in a way that supports students in the best way possible. And you can see a product of that sitting beside me who's doing incredible work partly because of the education that she received in a public education setting.</p>
</details>

主持人: 就支持而言，你们从会员那里听到了哪些诉求？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In terms of the supports, what are some of the calls that you were hearing from some of the members?</p>
</details>

Muna: 好的，我举个例子。安大略省社会科学课程大纲的很大一部分都涉及讨论时事。所以我们会接到电话，询问我们如何将A、B、C作为时事来讨论。我们总是回到一个问题：它是否在你的课程大纲中？好的，如果在你的课程大纲中，那么我们就会讨论你是否引入了各种资源，你是否引入了学生的生活经验，你是否试图培养学生带来自己的资源并批判性评估这些资源的方式。我们希望帮助学生成为能够融入世界并以建设性和富有成效的方式进行政治讨论的成年人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I'll give you an example. Much of the Ontario curriculum in the social sciences talks about talking about current events. So we'll get a call saying how do we talk about AB and C as a current event and so we always come back to is it in your curriculum okay yes it's in UI curriculum then we talk about are you bringing in a variety of resources are you bringing in students lived experiences are you trying to foster ways so that students can bring their own resources in and critically assess those resources we want to help students become adults who can integrate in a world and have political discussions in a way that's constructive and productive for society</p>
</details>

主持人: 我想更好地了解。我上高中时，手机还不普及，它们虽然存在，但教室里通常不允许使用。人们不会录制视频。现在你可以看到教室里发生以前从未见过的事情。我很好奇，在你上学的时候，学生们是否会录下老师的视频并发布到社交媒体上？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to have a better When I was in high school, cell phones weren't really around, you know, uh they were around, but they weren't really allowed in the classroom. People weren't recording uh videos. You can see things that are happening in the classroom that you would never see before. And I I am curious, do do students ever record teachers at the time that you were in school and post videos on social media?</p>
</details>

Sarah: 嗯，好的。我个人从未见过那样的事情。我理解那可能是一个担忧，尤其是在进行一场带有政治色彩的对话，或者与学生进行一些可能更脆弱的交流时，你明白我的意思吗？我从未见过我的任何同学或同伴做那样的事情。当然，我们有时会和老师合影，或者有时会互相分享一些东西，但我从未见过有人故意去损害别人的形象。我并不是说这种情况不会发生。当然，我的视角是基于我的高中经历和我一起长大的人，所以是比较狭隘的。但在我的经验中，我没有见过那样的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, okay. So, I personally I've never seen something like that. like I I understand that might be a concern, especially when you're having a politically charged conversation um or something that that might be a little bit more vulnerable with your students, you know what I mean? And I I've never seen any of my peers or classmates doing something like that. Of course, like there have been times where we'll take photos with our teachers or sometimes like share things amongst each other, but I've never seen anyone try and um go out of their way to harm someone's image like that. Um now, I'm not saying that this doesn't happen. Of course, I have very like myopic lens based on my high school experience and the people that I grew up with. Um but in my experience, I haven't seen something like that.</p>
</details>

Muna: 请不要这样做，这是我的第一个想法。我的第二个想法是，我们非常努力地在学期开始时建立所谓的课堂规范，以便学生们感到安全，能够在课堂上进行良好的对话。想到有人可能会在学生们尝试思考和提出想法时录像，作为一名保护课堂学生的老师，这让我感到恐惧。不幸的是，我们的系统资金不足，我班上有30或40个孩子，我们正在努力进行对话，而你却在混乱的某个瞬间捕捉到片段，这对我要保护的学生来说是如此没有成效和有害。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Lena, please don't would be my first thought. Uh my second thought is is we work really hard to create what we call classroom norms at the beginning of a semester so that students feel safe to be able to have really good conversations in classroom. And to think that somebody could videotape as students are experimenting with thoughts and ideas as a teacher who's protective of the students in my classroom. It it terrifies me that that's a thought they could have. And and we have unfortunately an underfunded system where I have 30 or 40 kids in a class and we're trying to have a conversation and you catch a snippet in a moment of chaos that's so unproductive and harmful to the students I'm meant to protect in my class.</p>
</details>

主持人: 那会给教学内容带来限制吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Does that put the a chill on what to teach?</p>
</details>

Muna: 是的，这绝对会。我作为老师的首要职责是保护我课堂上的学生，而做这种违反——我猜是每项校董会政策（我知道在我所在的校董会，这违反了校董会政策）——的事情，确实会让学生们觉得他们无法在学习过程中进行脆弱的对话，因为他们担心有人会拍摄。所以，我很高兴看到我们对手机采取了更强硬的立场，以确保这类事情不会在课堂上发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it absolutely does. And my primary role as a teacher is to protect the students in my classroom and doing something like that which violates I'm going to guess every single board policy. I know in my board it violates board policy really puts students in a place where they don't feel like they can have vulnerable conversations as they're learning because they're worried someone's going to f uh film. So, I'm really pleased to see that we're taking a stronger tone on cell phones to make sure things like that aren't happening in class.</p>
</details>

主持人: 在这种特定情况下，当技术导致你无法进行这些对话时，谁会是受害者？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Who who loses out um in that in what sort of technology can create in that particular example where you can't have these conversations?</p>
</details>

Muna: 学生。你知道，我前几天读到一位记者的推文，他发了一条关于某事的细致入微的推文，结果却遭到了恶毒的攻击，没有细致的对话。我心想，我们正在失去进行政治讨论的能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Students. And you know, I I read a tweet from a reporter the other day about he put out a tweet and it was nuanced about something and then there was vitrial that came at him. No nuanced conversation. And I thought to myself, we're losing the ability to have political discourse</p>
</details>

Sarah: 因为我们找不到可以安全练习的地方。如果我们说：“好吧，你在学校不能谈论这个。”那么，如果你不能在课堂这个安全的环境中学习如何进行尊重、细致和有分歧的对话，你又能在哪里学呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because we're not finding places where we can practice it in a safe way. If we say, "Well, you can't talk about this in school." Where are you going to learn to have a respectful conversation with nuance and disagreement if it's not in the safe environment of a classroom?</p>
</details>

主持人: 是的，我同意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, pick up on</p>
</details>

Sarah: 这是一个非常好的观点。我认为学校，以及整个教育，是你成长以及作为社会一员开始思考和运作的基础。你知道，我是一名刚入学的大一新生，人们谈论**象牙塔**（Ivory Tower: 指脱离实际生活、专注于学术研究的环境），以及它如何像一个真空、一个封闭的空间。我认为这可能是一件好事，我认为高中也是学生们促进对话的好地方，他们可以在那里自由开放地表达自己的观点，并在那个环境中感到安全。这是一种公共领域，你可以在其中分享任何你想分享的东西，并进行富有成效的讨论，不受未来作为成年人可能限制你表达真相和为自己观点辩护的任何社会经济因素的限制。我认为这是培养批判性思维能力、评估周围时事能力的好方法，它就是。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that is such a good point. I think that um schools like and and just education as a whole is like the foundation for how you grow up and how you begin to think and function as a member of our society. And you know even I I I'm a fresh university student so I'm in my first year and people talk about the ivory tower and how it's a very like it's a vacuum. It's a secluded space and I think that that can be a great thing and I think that's high school is also a great place for students to facilitate conversation where they can share their opinions freely and openly and and be safe in that environment. It's a kind of public sphere where you are able to share whatever you want and have productive discourse not limited to whatever um like social economic factors that might confine you in the future as an adult to speak your truth and advocate for yourself in your own views and I think that's a great way to foster critical thinking abilities the ability to evaluate the current events going on around you it's just</p>
</details>

Muna: 这就是进行这些对话的地方，所以它们受到威胁，并且在某种程度上受到压制，这没有道理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it is the place to have those conversations so it doesn't make sense that they're under threat and that they are um being you know there is a chill like in some ways.</p>
</details>

主持人: 我想接着Muna的一个评论，但我想更好地了解你在高中时想进行但未能进行的对话。无论是和你的同学，因为他们觉得不舒服，还是和你的老师。你当时渴望谈论哪些事情，比如“我们能谈谈吗？周末发生了什么事，或者发生了什么事，我真的很想谈谈。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to pick up on a a comment that Muna had made but I want to get a better understanding of the conversations that you felt that you wanted to have in high school but that you couldn't have. Um whether it's with your classmates because they felt uncomfortable around having that conversation or whether it was your teachers. What were some of the things that you were yearning to just like can we talk? Something happened over the weekend or something happened. I really want to talk about it.</p>
</details>

Sarah: 嗯，我的意思是，就像我说的，我想我特别幸运，遇到了我的老师们以及其他一切。我认为，存在很多政治冷漠，尤其是在我这一代，甚至比我大几岁的人群中。我认为部分原因是这类对话没有得到足够的鼓励，而且政治两极分化非常严重。我认为，在没有任何指导的情况下进行这些对话真的很难。这就是为什么我觉得能有像Muna这样的教育工作者来鼓励这种对话真的很好。我的意思是，我会自由地表达我的想法。我没有觉得我被阻止进行我想进行的对话。但当然，当你进行带有政治色彩、人们情绪激动的对话时，这确实会带来后果。你可能会陷入争论等等。我认为，我的学校里最激烈的时候，或者围绕任何特定对话的时候，是美国大选之前和之后。当然，我的老师们没有试图公开告诉我们他们的观点，但围绕美国大选确实存在很多分歧和很多讨论。我认为那是一个很好的时期，我和我的同学们经历了健康的政治讨论，因为我们也被教导如何理解呈现给我们的信息，以及如何以正确的方式消化它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I mean I like I said I I think I got particularly lucky with who my teachers were and everything like that. I think that um there is a lot of political apathy um especially in um my generation and um even in like like a few years older than me. And I think it's partially because conversations like this are not being encouraged as much and there's so much political polarization. And I think it's really hard to have those conversations when you don't have any guidance. Which is why I feel like it's really great to have educators like Muna who are like encouraging that that that conversation. And I mean I I would freely speak my mind. I I did not I did not feel like I was being blockaded from having the conversations that I wanted to have. But that does come with consequence of course when you have when you have conversations that are um politically charged that people are emotional about. You might get into arguments and things like that. And I think I mean I I I think the most heated time at my school um or surrounding any particular conversation was the US election prior to and afterward. Um, of course, my teachers didn't try to to um outwardly tell tell us their opinions, but um there were a lot of disagreements and and a lot of discourse um surrounding the US election. And I think that that was a great time where me and my classmates experienced healthy political discourse because we were also being taught um how to understand the information that was being presented to us and how to consume it in the proper way.</p>
</details>

### 教育部备忘录的解读与教师的信任

主持人: 好的，我想读一份备忘录。这是前教育部长**Jill Dunlop**（前教育部长）去年在10月7日袭击事件一周年之际发给全省各校董会的，我将部分宣读。备忘录中写道：“我们学校的重点必须始终是学习。这意味着我们的学校和与学校相关的活动绝不能被用作政治抗议的工具，以传播煽动性、歧视性和仇恨内容。虽然每个人都有权持有自己的政治观点，但他们无权将政治偏见传播到我们的课堂中。”我们确实联系了教育部征求意见，但在录制前没有收到回复。Muna，你如何解读教育部这份备忘录？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, I want to read a memo. Uh this was sent out by the former education minister Jill Dunlop last year to school boards across the province around the time of the first anniversary of the October 7th attack which I will read in part. The focus in our schools must always be on learning. This means our schools and school related activities should never be used as vehicles for political protests that enable inflammatory, discriminatory and hateful content. While everyone is entitled to their own political opinions, they are not entitled to disseminate political biases into our classrooms. We did reach out to the Ministry of Education for comment, but we did not hear back in time for this taping. But Muna, how do you interpret this memo from the ministry?</p>
</details>

Muna: 嗯，有时不清楚。所以我理解他们试图促进一个安全的学习环境，这是每位教育工作者都致力于实现的。那是我们的目标，尽可能地保障学生的安全。但是，如果能有更多的清晰度，我们会非常感激，因为我举个例子，我是一名政治老师。我们必须教授的很多内容都是政治偏见。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, unclear at times, and so I understand that they're trying to promote a safe learning environment, which every educator is committed to. Like that is our goal, keeping students safe as much as possible. Um, but more clarity would have been appreciated because I'll give you an example. I'm a politics teacher. Much of what we have to teach is political biases.</p>
</details>

主持人: 完全正确。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Exactly. And we have to talk about, you know, some of some very difficult topics and some terrible things that happened historically. And so, does that memo direct us not to teach curriculum?</p>
</details>

Muna: 我希望不是。我希望部长不会抛弃课程大纲。这只是缺乏清晰度的问题，对于如此重要的事情来说，这是一个问题。我认为部长有机会，你知道，召集专家、教师和教育工作者一起，让我们深入探讨学校正在发生的事情，并找到在课程大纲框架内工作的方法，以确保学生的需求得到满足，并且没有人会在课堂上感到不安全，因为这才是目标，对吗？你知道，安全和学习是齐头并进的，要信任教师，我们把学生的需求放在第一位。如果教育部长信任我们，我认为他们会对这个系统有更多的信心，作为教育部长，他们应该有这种信心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm I'm hoping not. I I wouldn't I would hope that the minister isn't sort of sort of throwing away curriculum. It's just um a lack of clarity is an issue and for something that's so important. I think that there's an opportunity for the minister, you know, bring experts to the table, bring teachers and education workers to the table. Let's unpack what's happening in schools and finding ways where we can work within the curriculum to make sure that students are having their needs needs met in a way that nobody feels unsafe in the classroom because that's the goal, right? You know, safety and learning hand in hand and trust teachers like we put student needs first. If the Minister of Education would trust us, I think that they would have a lot more faith in the system, which they should have as the Minister of Education.</p>
</details>

### 偏见、信任与教育系统的未来

主持人: 你在你的经历中稍微提到了这一点。你似乎有很多很棒的老师。我们都有自己的偏见。关键在于我们如何处理它。作为记者，作为老师，我们身兼多职。你有没有觉得老师有偏见？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you've touched on this a little bit um in your experience. It seems like you had a a number of great teachers. Um we all have our biases. It's how we approach it. We are wearing many hats as a journalist, as a teacher. Uh did you ever feel like teachers had a bias?</p>
</details>

Sarah: 嗯，我认为很多人都非常担心政治叙事和偏见在课堂中的传播，尤其是在学校谈论政治言论时。我只是觉得认为你可以拥有一个没有偏见的课堂有点无意义。我认为每个人天生都有偏见。如果你认为某事有价值并值得谈论，那就是你对该主题的偏见。你赋予它价值，因此你对它有偏见。所以我确实认为我的所有老师都有偏见。我也有偏见。每个人都有自己的偏见。但我认为这取决于你如何处理它，以及你是否让你的学生，你交谈的人意识到，你所说的并不一定是客观的，也不是普遍的，或者，你知道，双方都可能做出某些判断。我认为这在任何对话中都非常重要，不仅仅是在政治言论方面，而且，例如，我在高中时上了很多历史课，这一点被反复强调，尤其是在我们阅读不同作者、不同来源等等时。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I think that it's a lot of people are so worried about um the dissemination of political narratives and biases in classrooms, especially when it comes to talking about political speech in schools. Um, and I I just find it a bit senseless to think that you can have a biasless classroom. I think that everyone inherently has bias. If you decide that something is valuable and worth talking about, that is your bias toward that subject. You're ascribing it value and therefore you are biased towards it. So I I do think of course all my teachers had bias. I'm a I am biased. Everyone has their biases. But I think it depends on how you approach that and if you make your students aware, the people that you're talking to aware um that what you are saying is not necessarily objective and that it's not universal or um you know there is there are certain judgments that can be made on either side. I think that that is really important um in any conversation, not even just in terms of political speech, but um for example, I took a lot of history classes in high school and that is something that was stressed so much um to us, especially when we were reading from diff different authors, different sources and and things like that.</p>
</details>

Sarah: 嗯，所以我确实认为老师们当然会有政治偏见。他们会有自己的个人经历，这些经历会影响他们的观点，但我也认为，如果处理得当，这些对话可以非常富有成效，他们仍然可以在不一定将自己的叙事或观点强加给学生的情况下，与学生进行对话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um so I I do think that of course teachers would have political bias. they will have their own personal experiences that in influence their opinions, but I also think that if if handled well, those conversations can be extremely productive and they can still um navigate conversations with students without necessarily imposing their own narrative or opinions on them.</p>
</details>

主持人: Muna，对于将要观看和收听此节目的教育工作者，关于他们如何在课堂上处理敏感话题，有什么建议吗？

<p class="english-text">Muna, um, for the educators who are going to be watching this and listening to this, what is a a takeaway, um, in terms of how they handle sensitive topics in the classroom?</p>

Muna: 继续做你们正在做的事情，因为你们做得非常好。当我和一位从我们公共教育系统毕业的学生坐在一起时，她各方面都表现出色，这证明了安大略省6万名**OSSTF**会员所做的出色工作。所以，请继续以关怀和友善的态度对待公共教育，继续做那些把学生放在第一位的优秀课程专家。所以我的信息与其说是给我们省的老师们，我知道他们把学生放在第一位，不如说是给教育部长，是关于建立对一个为我们的学生运作良好的系统的信心，并为其提供适当的资金，这样你就可以在课堂上进行这些对话，而班上没有40个其他学生。你能想象一场辩论吗？你和40个学生讨论一些非常，你知道，非常困难的事情。请为我们的学校提供适当的资金，减少班级规模，信任你们的教育工作者，并在家庭中建立信心。我送我的孩子去学校，因为我热爱我们的公共教育系统。所以，这不是给我同事们的信息，而是给教育部长的。

<p class="english-text">Keep doing what you're doing because you're so good. You're so good at it. And when I sit beside a student who graduated from our public education system who's absolutely rocking it in every way, it's a testament to the incredible work that the 60,000 OSSTF members in Ontario do. And so keep approaching public education from a place of caring and kindness and keep being those incredible curriculum experts who put students first. And so my message isn't so much to the teachers in our province who I know are putting students first. It's to the Minister of Education is to build confidence in a system that's working so well for our students and to fund it appropriately so that you can have these conversations in your classroom without 40 other students in the class. Can you imagine a debate? you experienced it with 40 students discussing something really, you know, you know, really difficult. Fund our schools appropriately, smaller class sizes, trust your educators, and build confidence among families. I send my child to school because I love our public education system. So, message not to my colleagues, it's the minister of education.</p>

### 大学环境中的言论自由

主持人: 好的，Sarah，最后一个问题。正如我们提到的，你现在正在上大学，你明确表示你在高中时并没有感到被压制或被噤声。但是，你现在在大学里，在言论方面是否感到更自由？

<p class="english-text">All right, Sarah, you got the last question. uh you're in university now as we mentioned and you made it very clear that you were you didn't feel like you um you know were uh silenced or or anything in high school but do you feel freer now that you're in university in terms of what you can say?</p>
</details>

Sarah: 嗯，我认为在大学里，你身处一个更集中、对你所上的任何课程都非常感兴趣的人群中。所以我正在上四门伦理课。我们每天都在辩论各种话题。

<p class="english-text">Um I think that um just being in university um you are in a much more concentrated group of people who are very interested in whatever um class you're in. So I'm taking like four ethics classes. We are debating every single day topics.</p>
</details>

Sarah: 嗯，这正是高中和类似学校里那些被视为禁忌的对话，以及教育部或**福特政府**（Ford government: 指由道格·福特领导的安大略省政府）不希望你谈论的事情。我刚从高中毕业，我看到所有这些事情，比如可能罢免校董，以及试图决定学生或老师在学校里可以谈论什么，不可以谈论什么。这真的让我很担忧，因为我在教育方面有很好的经历，我不想看到学生或老师在这方面失去他们的自主权和言论自由。但就大学而言，我确实认为我周围有很多志同道合的同伴，他们对政治感兴趣，对辩论这些事情感兴趣。所以，如果你把自由定义为人们更愿意谈论他们感兴趣的事情，那么是的。

<p class="english-text">Um and it it is exactly the kind of conversations that are taboo in in in schools in high school and things like that and things that the Ministry of Ed education or the Ford government that they don't want you to talk about and and things like that. And I I'm watching as I just graduated from high school and I'm seeing all of these things like the potential removal of school trustees and and you know like um trying to decide what students or teachers can and cannot talk about in schools. And that's really concerning to me because I did have a great experience um in terms of my education and I don't want to see students or teachers lose their autonomy in that in that sense and what they can talk about in their freedom. Um but yeah, in terms of university, I I do think that I'm I'm surrounded by a lot of like-minded peers, people who are interested in politics, people who are interested in um debating these things. So I I do think that if you constitute freedom as what people are more willing to talk about because that's what they're interested in, then yes.</p>

主持人: 好的，我们就到这里。Sarah，Muna，非常感谢你们的时间。我想我们都同意，我们正处于良好的掌控之中。未来无忧。我们很好。谢谢。
