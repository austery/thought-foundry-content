### 埃普斯坦文件风波

**Will Jarvis**: 来自《纽约时报》，这是新闻头条。我是 Will Jarvis，代替 Tracy Mumford。今天是 2 月 2 日星期一。以下是我们今天关注的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: From The New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Will Jarvis in for Tracy Mumford. Today's Monday, February 2nd. Here's what we're covering.

</details>

**Will Jarvis**: 这项审查已经结束。我的意思是，我们审查了超过 600 万页文件，数万张图片，这正是法律规定的我们必须做的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: This review is over. I mean, we reviewed over 6 million pieces of paper, tens of thousands of images, and which is what the statute required us to do.

</details>

**Will Jarvis**: 你知道，这很有意思。**特朗普政府**正在为其处理**埃普斯坦**文件的方式辩护，此前其于周五发布的数百万页新文件遭到了**杰弗里·埃普斯坦**虐待幸存者的强烈抗议。**司法部**未能按时在 12 月份发布所有与这位被定罪的性交易者相关的文件。数百名政府律师在上个月争分夺秒地审查和编辑这些文件。但编辑工作有时显得杂乱无章，18 名幸存者在一份声明中表示，他们的姓名和身份信息被泄露了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: You know, it's interesting. The **Trump administration** is defending its handling of the **Epstein** files after its release of millions of new pages on Friday was met with outrage from survivors of **Jeffrey Epstein's** abuse. The **Justice Department** had missed a December deadline to release all of its files related to the convicted sex trafficker. And hundreds of government lawyers spent the last month scrambling to review and redact the documents. But the redactions sometimes appeared to be haphazard, and a group of 18 survivors said in a statement that they exposed names and identifying information of Epstein's victims.

</details>

**Will Jarvis**: 当然，这种审查的性质以及审查材料的数量之大，意味着这种情况有时会发生。因此，我们正努力确保我们已纠正了这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: Of course, the nature of this type of review was so the volume of materials that were reviewed, there would be times when this happened. And so we're working hard to make sure that we fixed that.

</details>

**Will Jarvis**: **副总检察长托德·布兰奇**告诉 ABC 新闻，司法部正在采取措施，一旦发现敏感信息，就追溯性地将其清除。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: Deputy Attorney General **Todd Blanch** told ABC News that the DOJ is moving to retroactively scrub sensitive information as it's made aware of it.

</details>

**Will Jarvis**: 周末期间，《泰晤士报》的记者在审查这些文件时，发现了数十张未被编辑的年轻女性（可能是青少年）的裸照，这些照片在发布期间被该部门发布到了其网站上。照片包含了她们的身体和面部。一位曾在法庭上就埃普斯坦的虐待行为作证的女性告诉《泰晤士报》：“很难想象还有比让她们的全身裸照供全世界下载更恶劣的保护受害者的方式了。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: Over the weekend, Times reporters reviewing the documents flagged dozens of unredacted nude images of young women, possibly teenagers, that the department posted to its website during the release. The photos included both their bodies and their faces. One woman who's testified in court about Epstein's abuse told the Times, quote, "It's hard to imagine a more egregious way of not protecting victims than having full nude images of them available for the world to download."

</details>

**Will Jarvis**: 与此同时，在《泰晤士报》审查周五发布的文件时，我的同事们发现了数千份提及**特朗普**总统的文件，他多年来一直是埃普斯坦的密友。在提及特朗普的文件中，有一份**FBI**的备忘录称该机构掌握了关于他的“耸人听闻的信息”。其中一些信息似乎来自 FBI 收到的线报，包括对特朗普和埃普斯坦性虐待的指控。该备忘录未包含任何佐证信息，且《泰晤士报》未能核实这些线报。副总检察长昨日表示，司法部已调查了针对特朗普的性行为不端指控，但未发现可信信息。特朗普否认与埃普斯坦有关的任何不当行为，并表示新文件“使他清白”。除了特朗普，这些文件还强调了埃普斯坦与其他知名男士的联系，即使在他于 2008 年成为被定罪的性犯罪者之后。例如，文件似乎显示**埃隆·马斯克**在 2012 年渴望访问埃普斯坦的私人岛屿，并写信给他：“你岛上最疯狂的派对会在哪天/哪个晚上举行？”同年，现任商务部长的**霍华德·鲁特尼克**给埃普斯坦发邮件，安排与妻子和孩子一同前往该岛。英国亿万富翁**理查德·布兰森**在 2013 年会面后给埃普斯坦发邮件，写道：“你来附近的时候，我们很乐意见到你，只要你带上你的‘herm’。”布兰森的代表回应称，他们的会面主要集中在商业事务上。鲁特尼克表示他与埃普斯坦没有共度任何时间，而马斯克则表示他拒绝了多次访问该岛的邀请。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: Meanwhile, as part of the Times review of Friday's document release, my colleagues found thousands of files that mentioned President **Trump**, who was a close friend of Epstein's for years. Among the Trump mentions, an **FBI** memo that said the agency had quote salacious information about him. Some of that information appeared to be from tips the FBI had received, including accusations of sexual abuse by Trump and Epstein. The memo didn't contain any corroborating information and the Times was not able to verify the tips. The deputy attorney general said yesterday that the DOJ looked into sexual misconduct allegations against Trump but did not find credible information. Trump, who's denied any wrongdoing in connection to Epstein, said the new files quote absolved him. And beyond Trump, the files underscore Epstein's ties to other prominent men who were in his orbit, even after he became a convicted sex offender in 2008. For example, the documents appear to show that **Elon Musk** was eager to visit Epstein's private island in 2012, writing to him, quote, "What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?" That same year, **Howard Lutnik**, now the Secretary of Commerce, emailed Epstein to arrange a trip with his wife and kids to the island. And **Richard Branson**, the British billionaire, emailed Epstein in 2013 after a meeting saying, quote, "Anytime you're in the area, we'd love to see you as long as you bring your herm." In response to the documents release, a Branson representative said their meeting had been focused on business. Lutnik said he spent zero time with Epstein, and Musk said he'd declined repeated invitations to visit the island.

### 特朗普政府与肯尼迪中心

**Will Jarvis**: 现在，关于**特朗普政府**还有两个快速更新。在昨天的意外宣布中，特朗普总统表示，他计划从今年夏天开始关闭**肯尼迪中心**两年，进行一项重大的重建项目。特朗普表示，这将包括“彻底重建”，但他没有说明成本多少或资金来源。自上任以来，总统将自己的名字添加到大楼上，在董事会安插亲信，并致力于重塑其节目。作为回应，一批知名艺术家已抵制该场所，国家交响乐团的入场人数也下降了 50%。这个人毁了这个地方。他让它在经济上破产。他把它变成了一个表演者不想去表演的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: Now, two more quick updates on the **Trump administration**. In a surprise announcement yesterday, President Trump said that he plans to shut down the **Kennedy Center** for 2 years starting this summer for a major reconstruction project. Trump said that will include a quote complete rebuilding, though he did not say how much that would cost or where the money would come from. Since taking office, the president added his name to the building, installed loyalists on the board, and worked to reshape its programming. In response, a slate of high-profile artists have boycotted the venue, and attendance at the National Symphony Orchestra there has plummeted 50%. This man has destroyed the place. He has run it into the ground financially. He's made it a place where performers don't want to perform.

</details>

**Will Jarvis**: 作为回应，包括负责该中心资金的民主党议员在内的民主党议员表示，他们对该计划一无所知，并指责特朗普试图掩盖他在此造成的“财务灾难”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: In response, Democratic lawmakers, including one who oversees funding for the center, said they've been kept in the dark about the plan and accused Trump of trying to cover up the quote financial disaster he's created there.

### 特朗普加密货币公司与阿联酋交易

**Will Jarvis**: 新的报道显示，就在特朗普总统去年就职前几天，一家与**阿拉伯联合酋长国**有关的投资公司收购了特朗普家族加密货币公司近一半的股份。这家与阿联酋有关的公司悄悄向**World Liberty Financial**注资约 5 亿美元，这一举动最早由《华尔街日报》报道，并得到《泰晤士报》的证实。这笔巨额投资是去年涉及特朗普加密货币公司和阿联酋政府的两笔大型交易之一。特朗普上任几个月后，阿联酋与白宫达成协议，获得了数十万枚先进的**AI芯片**。尽管存在国家安全担忧，白宫和 World Liberty Financial 都否认了这笔投资与芯片交易之间存在任何联系。但特朗普家族企业与政府之间的界限模糊，引起了道德专家的警觉，并引发了民主党议员的严厉批评。参议员**伊丽莎白·沃伦**在昨天的声明中表示：“这是赤裸裸的腐败。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: And new reporting has shown that just days before President Trump was inaugurated last year, an investment firm tied to the **United Arab Emirates** purchased nearly half of the Trump family's cryptocurrency company. The UAE tied firm quietly poured around $500 million into **World Liberty Financial**, a move that was first reported by the Wall Street Journal and confirmed by the Times. The major investment was one of two large transactions last year involving Trump's crypto firm and the Amiradi government. And a few months after Trump took office, the UAE secured a deal with the White House to get hundreds of thousands of advanced **AI chips**. Despite national security concerns, both the White House and World Liberty Financial have denied any connection between the investment and the chips deal. But the blurred lines between Trump's family business and the administration have set off alarm bells for ethics experts and sparked sharp criticism from Democratic lawmakers. In a statement yesterday, Senator **Elizabeth Warren** said, quote, "This is corruption, plain and simple."

### 最高法院加强保密

**Will Jarvis**: 在**最高法院**，一项《纽约时报》的调查发现，**首席大法官**正通过让书记员和工作人员签署**保密协议（NDA）**来加强法院对信息的控制。这种加强保密的举措始于 2024 年 11 月，当时有新闻报道对大法官们提出了道德质疑。此前还发生了一系列不同寻常的内部文件泄露事件，包括推翻堕胎权的决定。传统上，法院工作人员被期望对幕后发生的事情保持沉默，但这些保密协议似乎更进一步，可能威胁对泄露机密信息的员工采取法律行动。最高法院的大法官们长期以来一直认为保密性对法院的审理过程至关重要，让他们能够在不受公众审视的情况下处理重大问题。但批评者认为，这种保密性会损害公众对该机构的信任。根据去年**皮尤研究中心**的一项调查，约一半的美国人对最高法院持负面看法，这几乎是历史性的低点。法院的一位女发言人拒绝就保密协议发表评论。您可以在 ny times.com 上阅读完整调查。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: At the **Supreme Court**, a New York Times investigation has found that the **Chief Justice** has been tightening the court's hold on information by making clerks and staff sign **non-disclosure agreements (NDAs)**. That push for more secrecy started back in November 2024 amid news reports that raised ethics questions about the justices. There had also been a series of unusual leaks of internal court documents, including the decision overturning the right to abortion. Court staff have traditionally been expected to keep quiet about what's happening behind the scenes, but the NDAs appear to go further, potentially threatening legal action against staff who reveal confidential information. Supreme Court justices have long said confidentiality is crucial to the court's process, letting them wrestle with big questions without public scrutiny. But critics say that secrecy can undermine trust in the institution. According to a survey last year from the **Pew Research Center**, about half of Americans have an unfavorable view of the Supreme Court, an almost historic low. A spokeswoman for the court declined to comment about the NDAs. You can read the full investigation at ny times.com.

### 西部暖冬威胁水资源

**Will Jarvis**: 我们需要雪。我们需要雪。我们需要雪。这不正常。太疯狂了。在美国西部，一个异常温暖的冬天伴随着创纪录的低积雪量，正威胁着全年剩余时间的水资源。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: We need snow. We need snow. We need snow. This is not normal. It's crazy. Across the western US, an unusually warm winter with record low snow cover is threatening water resources for the rest of the year.

</details>

**Will Jarvis**: 是的，那些知名度假胜地如今像沙漠一样干涸，在以深厚天然积雪闻名的地区，如犹他州的帕克城和科罗拉多州的维尔。大部分地面呈棕色且光秃秃的，该地区的居民仍在 50 至 60 华氏度的天气里徒步和骑行。例如，科罗拉多州正经历自 1895 年以来最温暖的冬天。冬季的积雪通常会为水提供天然储存，并在全年融化径流。但今年的降雪干旱是西部地区长达数十年的干旱期中的一个令人担忧的数据点。这导致科罗拉多河两大水库的水位极低。4000 万美国人依赖这条河流获取水源，它对农业至关重要。尽管如此，一些水资源专家仍试图保持乐观，希望有春雪和夏雨。亚利桑那州的一位研究人员告诉《泰晤士报》：“怪事可能会发生，所以让我们希望怪事会发生。否则，情况将非常糟糕。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Will Jarvis**: Yes, the good well-known resorts are cooked dry as the desert in places famous for deep natural snow like Park City, Utah and Veil, Colorado. Much of the ground has been brown and bare, and people across the region are still hiking and biking in 50 to 60° weather. Colorado, for example, is having its warmest winter since 1895. A winter snow pack would normally provide natural storage for water that would melt and run off throughout the year. But this year's snow drought is a troubling data point in what is now a decades-long dry spell in the West. That's led to extremely low water levels in the two largest reservoirs on the **Colorado River**. 40 million Americans rely on that river for water and it's crucial for agriculture. Some water experts are trying to be optimistic though, hoping for spring snow and summer rain. One researcher in Arizona told the Times, quote, "Weird things can happen, so let's hope weird things happen. Otherwise, it's going to be pretty awful."

### 格莱美奖创历史

**Will Jarvis**: 最后，昨晚在**格莱美奖**颁奖典礼上，一位又一位艺术家创造了历史。“我不太擅长谈论自己，但我通过音乐来表达。”**肯德里克·拉马尔**获得了五项奖杯，以总共 27 个奖项成为格莱美历史上获奖最多的说唱歌手。来自 Netflix 热门剧集《鬼灭之刃》（Demon Hunters）的歌曲《Golden》获得了 K-pop 类型音乐的首个格莱美奖。而**坏痞兔（Bad Bunny）**则成为首位赢得该奖项最高荣誉的西班牙语艺术家，凭借其融合了波多黎各本土声音和强劲电子节拍的专辑获得了年度专辑奖。“在我感谢上帝之前，我要说‘眼睛睁大’。”他是颁奖典礼上发表明确政治声明的表演者之一，与穿着徽章批评白宫移民镇压政策的比莉·艾利什（Billy Isish）、贾斯汀·比伯等人一同出现。“我们不是野兽。我们不是动物。我们不是外星人。我们是人类。我们是美国人。”颁奖典礼还标志着**史蒂文·斯皮尔伯格**成为娱乐界最稀有俱乐部之一的成员。凭借一部关于他长期合作者**约翰·威廉姆斯**的纪录片获得最佳音乐电影格莱美奖，斯皮尔伯格正式成为**EGOT**（艾美奖、格莱美奖、奥斯卡奖和托尼奖）得主，集齐了这四个奖项。他是包括安德鲁·劳埃德·韦伯、詹妮弗·哈德森和奥黛丽·赫本在内的仅有的 22 位获得此殊荣的人之一。以上是新闻头条。我是 Will Jarvis。明天再见。

**Will Jarvis**: And finally, at the **Grammy Awards** last night, one artist after another made history. "I'm not good at talking about myself, but I express it through the music." **Kendrick Lamar** took home five trophies to become the most decorated rapper in Grammy history with 27 total awards. The song Golden from the Netflix mega hit K-pop Demon Hunters became the first ever Grammy for the K-pop genre. And **Bad Bunny** became the first Spanish language artist to win the ceremony's top prize, taking the award for album of the year for his mix of native Puerto Rican sounds and booming electronic beats. "Before I say thanks to God, I'm going to say eyes out." He was one of a number of performers who made explicit political statements at the awards, joining Billy Isish, Justin Bieber, and others who wore pins criticizing the White House's immigration crackdown. "We're not savage. We're not animals. We're not aliens. We are humans. And we are Americans." The awards ceremony also marked the moment **Steven Spielberg** became a member of one of the rarest clubs in the entertainment industry. By winning the Grammy for best music film for a documentary about his longtime collaborator **John Williams**, Spielberg officially became an **EGOT** winner, locking in the G part of Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony. He's one of just 22 people, including Andrew Lloyd Weber, Jennifer Hudson, and Audrey Hepburn, to have ever earned that bragging right. Those are the headlines. I'm Will Jarvis. We'll be back tomorrow.
