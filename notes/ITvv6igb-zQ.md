John Michael McGrath: 今天在播客中，新民主党（**NDP**：New Democratic Party，加拿大主要政党之一，通常代表劳工和社会民主利益）已正式要求**廉政专员**（Integrity Commissioner：负责调查省议员行为操守的独立官员）调查劳工部长，因为**技能发展基金**（Skills Development Fund：一项旨在资助劳动力培训和技能提升的省级拨款计划）的争议仍在继续。

John Michael McGrath: 但是你今天为什么穿这个？

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> But uh why are you wearing that today?</p>
</details>

Jessica Smith Cross: 这不是因为我是球迷。因为约翰，我不是曲棍球球迷。甚至不是因为你喜欢痛苦和折磨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> It's not because I'm a fan. Because John, I am I'm not a hockey fan. Not even because you enjoy pain and suffering.</p>
</details>

不，我们今天将讨论技能发展基金。这与枫叶队有关。所以，当我们说我们应该穿一件有趣的衬衫时，我选了一件有趣的衬衫。

<p class="english-text">No, we're going to talk about the skills development fund today. And there's a Maple Leafs tie-in. So, when we uh said we should do a fun shirt, I picked a fun shirt.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 好的。嗯，我也把我的衬衫和我的哥斯拉T恤联系起来了。就是这样。嗯，我有很多哥斯拉T恤。我想我可能得制定一个规则，就是每周只要有那种我称之为经典的道格·福特（**Doug Ford**：安大略省省长）式的爆发，我就会穿一件哥斯拉T恤，因为他总是喜欢横冲直撞。

<p class="english-text">>> Okay. Well, uh I am also tying uh my shirt into and I'm wearing one of my Godzilla t-shirts. Uh there we go. Um I I own many Godzilla t-shirts. And I think I might have to adopt a rule that uh every week where there is um an outburst of the kind that I think of as as classic Doug Ford uh that I will wear a Godzilla t-shirt um because of the way he tends to sort of traml through</p>

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Um and we will discuss that a bit later. But yes, the the the premier had an outburst this week. Um and uh yeah, we we will uh discuss that uh in one of our later segments. Uh so without further ado, let's get to issue one.</p>
</details>

### 技能发展基金丑闻持续发酵

政府的技能发展基金丑闻本周仍在继续，新民主党领袖**马里特·斯泰尔斯**（Marit Stiles）向该省的廉政专员提出了投诉，指控劳工部长**戴维·帕奇尼**（David Pacini）在监督省级拨款分配时可能违反了省法律。不过，在我们谈论这个故事之前，我很想了解一下这个故事背后的故事。杰西卡，**《三叶草报》**（The Trillium：一家专注于安大略省政治新闻的数字媒体）几周来一直在主导这个故事的报道，我希望你能告诉我们一些背景信息。是什么让你开始走上这条路的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The government's skills development fund scandal continues this week with NDP leader Marit Stiles filing a complaint to the province's integrity commissioner that alleges Labor Minister David Pacini may have broken provincial law while overseeing the distribution of provincial grants. Before we get to that story though, I would love to get to the story behind the story if we can. Uh Jessica Trillium has really been leading a lot of the coverage uh for the story for weeks now and I'm hoping you can tell us a bit of the background here. Uh what got you started down this road?</p>
</details>

Jessica Smith Cross: 我想有两件不同的事情。首先，我们的一位记者**查理·平克顿**（Charlie Pinkerton）提出了一项**信息自由请求**（FOI request：Freedom of Information request，公民有权要求政府提供信息的法律程序），要求获取与另一个故事相关的一些文件，但这些文件却揭示了关于技能发展基金以及一个获得资助的团体的某些通信。邮件显示，公务员表示该项目在他们的评估中得分很低，但部长办公室仍然决定资助它。几个月后，**审计长**（Auditor General：负责审查政府支出和运作的独立官员）会就此发布一份完整的报告，这成了一件大事。但那时我们只知道这一个团体，他做了一个报道。大约在同一时间，我们从消息来源那里听到了一些信息，比如“这有点像一个**秘密基金**（slush fund：用于非法或不正当目的的资金）”。“你们应该调查一下。”在上次选举中，你可以看到许多支持**进步保守党**（PC：Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario，安大略省执政党）的劳工团体也获得了技能发展基金，并且他们对此非常公开。比如，我在温莎参加了竞选启动仪式。我与当天站在省长身后的一位男士交谈。我问：“你为什么支持省长？你为什么支持进步保守党？”那个人说：“哦，他们给了我们一大笔钱，对吧？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I guess there were two different things. Uh the first uh one of our reporters, Charlie Pinkerton, had done an FOI request, a freedom of information request for some documents related to a different story, but they turned up some communications about the skills development fund and a group that was awarded funding. And what the email showed was that the civil servants said that it had the project had been scored low in their assessment, but the minister's office had decided to fund it anyways. And this is something that like months and months months later, the auditor general would do a whole report on became a big deal. But then it was just this one group that we knew of and he did a story. Now at around the same time, we were hearing from sources stuff like this is a bit of a slush fund. You guys should be looking into this. And in the last election, you could see that a lot of the labor groups that endorsed the PCs also had gotten skills development fund and and then were very open about that. Like I was at the campaign launch in Windsor. Talked to one of the guys who'd been standing behind the premier that day. It's like why are you supporting the pre the premier? Why are you supporting the PCs? And the guy was like, "Oh, they gave us a bunch of money, right? Just</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 这就够了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> that'll do it."</p>
</details>

Jessica Smith Cross: 所以我们同意这一点。这很棒。这就是我们想要的。所以这很公平。但我们开始调查。我们基本上把它作为一个夏季项目。第一步是获取一份全面的清单，列出谁获得了多少钱，我们实际上还没有完全做到。我们不得不就最新几轮提出信息自由请求。这真是一个巨大的麻烦。但我们获得了第四轮和第五轮的资金，以及早期获得资金的团体名单。然后就是做研究。谁管理这些团体？他们是谁？他们与进步保守党或政府有什么联系？他们的游说者是谁？他们是如何向党派捐款的？正是这类故事真正开始滚动。然后审计长的报告出来了，然后线索开始涌入。所以关于枫叶队比赛、帕奇尼部长和巴黎婚礼等等，这些都是在我们开始做关于谁获得了资金以及他们可能与政府有什么联系的基本故事之后才出现的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So we agree with that. Like that's great. This is what we want. So that's fair enough. But so we started to look into it. We made it basically a project over the summer. Uh the first step was getting a comprehensive list of who got how much money, which we still haven't actually quite hit. Um we had to FOI for the latest rounds. Um and it just it was a huge headache. But we got rounds four and five and the list of funders fund the groups that got funding earlier. And then it was a matter of doing the research. Who runs these groups? Who are they? Uh what connections do they have to the PCs or the government? um have they who are their lobbyists? Uh how have they donated money to the party? And it was that kind of story that really got got rolling. Then the AG's report came out and then tips started flowing in. So the stuff about the Leafs game and Minister Pacini and the the wedding in Paris and all that that that came after we started just doing the basic story about who got the money and what connections they might have to the government.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 对。你提到还没有完整的清单。你已经提出了信息自由请求。《三叶草报》已经发起了一项众筹活动，试图弥补部分成本。公众可能并不总是理解，当媒体机构提出信息自由请求时，政府通常会回复说：“如果你想要所有这些文件，你必须支付X美元。”你被告知的金额非常大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Right. Uh you mentioned the uh not having the complete list quite yet. You've foied it. uh you the trillium has uh launched a a bit of a crowdfunding effort to try and cover some of the costs. Public may not always understand that when media outlets file for a freedom of information requests, it is very common for the government to come back and say, "Well, if you want all of these documents, you have to pay, you know, x dollars, you've been uh quoted a very large sum."</p>
</details>

Jessica Smith Cross: 是的。所以，我们做了很多信息自由请求。我们经常做信息自由请求。其中大部分我们没有预算来处理，但我们做了一系列请求，寻找与此相关的通信和文件。比如，我们很早就了解到，有少数几个获得资助的团体与政府有联系，这些是我们报道的重点。这少数几个请求的费用超过10,000美元。所以我们发起了一项众筹活动，我们请求选民、民众、读者捐款，如果他们想看到这些文件曝光。我们的承诺是，这些钱将只用于信息自由请求，并且当我们获得文件时，无论它们是什么，我们都会将其公开，我们撰写的任何相关报道也将免费阅读。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yes. Some So, we've done a lot of FOI requests. We do a lot of FOI requests. Most of them we haven't a budget to handle, but we did a series of requests looking for communications uh and documents related to it. Like a handful of these groups that got funding that we had learned early on had connections to the government and stuff that had been the focus of some of our reportings. Uh the cost over $10,000 for this handful of requests. So we launched a crowdfunding campaign where we're asking voters, people, readers to to send in some money if they want to see these documents come to light and the our commitment is to spend the money only on fo the foi requests uh and to make them public if when we get documents whatever they happen to be and any stories that we write on them will also be unpayweld.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 哦，太好了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Oh very nice.</p>
</details>

Jessica Smith Cross: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 好的。当然，正如我之前提到的，新民主党领袖马里特·斯泰尔斯已经向廉政专员提出了投诉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> All right. Now of course as I mentioned earlier uh the NDP leader Mart Stiles has filed a complaint to the integrity commissioner.</p>
</details>

此前向廉政专员提出的投诉并没有取得太大成果，原因很充分。廉政专员实际上不能对省议员施加惩罚，即使他们确实发现有违法行为。人们可能还记得**绿带丑闻**（Greenbelt scandal：安大略省政府将受保护的绿带土地开放用于开发，引发了利益冲突和环境担忧的争议），**史蒂夫·克拉克**（Steve Clark）在2023年被发现违反了《**议员廉政法案**》（Members' Integrity Act：规范安大略省议员行为和利益冲突的法律）。但任何对议员的惩罚都需要立法机关投票决定。这样的投票从未发生过。然后我们举行了一次选举。我认为现在可以说这是一个已经解决的问题了。到目前为止，你有没有感觉到省长是否真的想与这位劳工部长保持距离？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Previous complaints to the integrity commissioner uh haven't amounted to much for a very good reason. Uh the integrity commissioner cannot actually impose uh penalties on MPPPS even if they do find breaches of the law. Uh folks might remember from the green belt scandal that Steve Clark was found to have breached the Members Integrity Act in 2023. But it is up to the legislature to hold a vote for uh any punishments for a member. No such vote ever occurred. Then we had an election. I think it's safe to say that's a dead issue now. So far, do you get any sense of whether the premier is actually looking to distance himself from this labor minister?</p>
</details>

Jessica Smith Cross: 我会回答这个问题，我发誓。但首先，我想不同意你关于这个观点的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I will get to that, I swear. But first, I I want to disagree with you about the idea, okay,</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 关于廉政专员的报告，不是说我同意你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> about the integrity commissioner reports, not like I agree with you.</p>
</details>

Jessica Smith Cross: 你说得对，他们不会让任何人下台。你绝对正确。嗯，但是当你看看绿带报告时，我们所知道的关于整个绿带事件中发生的事情，很多都来自于廉政专员的调查。廉政专员有权传唤人员和文件，可以进行宣誓下的采访，并且可以获取很多事实，这是记者无法做到的，而且审计长会对此进行更宏观的审视。所以我认为这是值得的，我理解为什么反对党最近如此强调试图促成另一份廉政专员报告。但至于福特是否支持帕奇尼的问题，绝对支持。他现在坚定地支持他。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You're right that they're not going to see anybody kicked out of office. You're absolutely right. Um, but when you look at the green belt report, a lot of the things that we know about what happened in the whole Green Belt affair came from the Integrity Commissioner's investigation. the integrity commissioner has the power to like subpoena people in documents, can do interviews under oath and can just get to a lot of the the facts of the matter that uh journalists just just can't do and that the auditor general just takes a bigger broader look at it. So I think it it is worthwhile and I and I understand why um why there's been such an emphasis from the opposition parties lately on trying to spur another integrity commissioner report. But as to the question about Ford standing by Pacini, absolutely. He's uh he's standing by him firmly right now.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 是的。不，没有任何迹象表明有任何隔阂。嗯，如果我们在接下来的几个月里进行内阁改组，这并非不寻常，但是，嗯，我当然，所有公开露面都表明省长正在支持这位部长。当然，我的意思是，即使我们以前也见过这种戏码，对吧？当政府想要开始让一位部长淡出公众视线时，他们就会停止在质询环节中回答问题，而帕奇尼仍然在那里回答质询环节中的问题。所以，我怀疑，至少目前，他会留在原位。嗯，新民主党当然不是立法机关中唯一的反对党，在回应自由党**约翰·弗雷泽**（John Fraser）的过程中，福特省长在周三对政府的一些批评者发出了以下威胁，我相信我们有一段剪辑。你知道我们还要审计什么吗，议长女士？所有这些向**ACORN**（Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now：加拿大社区组织改革协会，一个倡导低收入居民权利的左翼草根组织）输送资金的伟大组织，比如**皇后公园**（QP：Queens Park，安大略省议会的所在地，常代指安大略省政府）和所有其他组织。但我们给机构钱，他们悄悄地把钱输送给这些左翼激进团体，他们并没有按照我们认为他们会使用的方式使用这些钱。但我向新民主党承诺，我们将审计所有这些所谓的慈善组织，它们正在输送资金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. No, there's there's been no no sign of any daylight. Um it wouldn't be uh unusual if we did get a cabinet shuffle in uh the next, you know, few months, but um I I certainly uh all public appearances are that uh the premier is is is backing uh the minister. Certainly, I mean, even like we've seen this play before, right? when the government wants to start um moving a minister out of the spotlight like they stop answering questions in question period and no pacini is still there answering questions in in question period. So I I I suspect that uh at least for now uh he's staying where he is. Uh the NDP of course are not the only opposition party in the legislature and in the course of responding to uh Liberal John Fraser uh Premier Ford on Wednesday made the following threat to some of his government's critics and I believe we've got a clip. And you know what else we're going to audit, Madam Speaker? All these great organizations that funnel money to ACORN like QP and all the rest of them. But we give money we give money to agencies and they funnel it quietly to these left-wing radical groups and they aren't using it for what we thought they're going to use it. But I promise the NDP we will be auditing all these so-called charitable organizations that are funneling money.</p>
</details>

请继续关注。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just stay tuned on that one.</p>
</details>

那是福特省长本周早些时候说的。他说请继续关注。我们确实继续关注了，甚至在当天结束之前，他们就开始收回那份声明了。但你对此有何看法，杰西卡？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Uh that was Premier Ford earlier this week. Uh now he said stay tuned on this one. We did stay tuned uh even before the day was out. They started walking that statement back. But what did you make of it, Jessica?</p>
</details>

Jessica Smith Cross: 嗯，这就是你今天穿哥斯拉衬衫的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Uh that this is the reason you wore a Godzilla shirt today.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 确实如此。正如我所说，这是经典的道格·福特式案例，省长有点虚张声势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yes indeed. This is uh the case of, as I say, classic Doug Ford, a bit of bluster from the premier.</p>
</details>

### 省长福特的“哥斯拉式”审计威胁

Jessica Smith Cross: 是的。不，我确实看到了。我认为这只是他被ACORN的嘲讽激怒了。他的评论，“找份工作吧，伙计。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. No, I I see that for sure. Uh this, I think, was just him getting ticked off by by being heckled by ACORN. Uh his comment uh you know, get a job, buddy. That</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yes,</p>
</details>

Jessica Smith Cross: 他在这一切之中回应了。你知道，这成了国际新闻。我想他被激怒了。而且，他似乎想威胁审计那些获得公共资金的人，也许是新民主党的盟友，并发现他们一直在滥用这些资金。但正如你所说，他收回了，这从未完全清楚，他在可能对负责任的政府造成损害之前就收回了。你知道，一个负责任的政府不会审计它的敌人并试图寻找问题，对吧？是的，他有点暗示了这一点，但后来又说：“不，不，这只是我们定期进行的审计。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> he replied to in the midst of all this. You know, it made international news. I think he was ticked off. Uh, and the it seemed like where he was going with this was a threat to audit uh people who get public funding, maybe allies of the NDP, and find they'd been misusing it. But then, as you said, he walked it, it was never quite clear, and he walked it back before it could be uh damaging to the responsible government. You know, a responsible government doesn't audit its enemies and try to find things, right? Yeah, he sort of suggested that but then was like, "No, no, this is just a regular course of audits that we do."</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 是的。你知道，也许只是为了让大家了解一下幕后情况，那天他在发表声明后，我在立法机关，我们都聚集在议会厅外的走廊里，新闻记者们都在问省长的工作人员：“他那句话是什么意思？”但他们没有给出答案。我想他们听到省长说的话可能和任何人一样惊讶。正如你所说，一个负责任的政府不会发出这种威胁。我们这周不会做你的专栏，我的专栏这个环节，但我只想说，我确实为TVO写了关于这件事的文章，因为这种威胁令人担忧，正是因为政府拥有如此广泛的权力来调查人们。我们在福特政府执政初期学到的一件事，至少我直到2018年福特政府成立时才知道，你可能还记得他们用来调查**公平水电计划**（Fair Hydro Plan：安大略省前自由党政府推出的一项旨在降低电费的计划）的那个特别委员会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And and you know, maybe just to give people a bit of a behind the scenes here, you know, I was at the legislature that day after he made that statement and and we were all gathered in the uh hallway outside the chamber and the members of the press gallery were asking members of the premier staff like what did he mean by that? And it it was not forthcoming. It was I I think maybe they were as surprised as anybody to hear what the premier had said. Um, as you say, like a a a responsible government would not make these kinds of threats. And we're not going to do a your column, my column uh segment this week, but I I will just say that I did write for TVO about this because uh these kinds of threats are are worrisome precisely because the government has such incredibly broad powers to uh investigate people. One of the things we learned very early on in the Ford government, at least I did not know this until 2018 when the Ford government uh created, you may remember that um select committee that they used to investigate the fair hydro plan.</p>
</details>

我在那些程序中了解到的一件事是，加拿大公民在议会委员会面前没有保持沉默的权利。如果你不回答议会委员会的问题，你就构成了藐视议会，这可能面临非常严重的惩罚。政府、立法机关拥有巨大的权力。人们不应该发出空洞的威胁。我将把这个话题留在这里。现在，为什么省长对QP和ACORN如此激动呢？因为正如你所提到的，他们是周一在立法机关抗议某项法案通过的团体之一。那是哪项法案呢？为此，我们将进入第二个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Something I learned during those proceedings is that um Canadian citizens do not have the right to remain silent before a parliamentary committee. If you do not answer a question from a a parliamentary committee, uh you are in contempt of parliament and that can face very serious penalties. the the government, the legislature, they have enormous powers. People should not make idle threats. Uh I I will leave that uh uh there. Um now, why of course was the premier so exercised about QP and ACORN? Uh because they were among the groups, as you mentioned, protesting the uh passage of a particular bill uh at the legislature on Monday. And which bill was that? For that, we will go to issue two.</p>
</details>

### 《第60号法案》与皮尔区水务争议

《**第60号法案**》（Bill 60：Fighting Delays Building Faster Act，旨在加快住房建设和基础设施项目的法案），即《应对延误，加快建设法案》，于周一在立法机关通过了三读。我们之前已经讨论过《第60号法案》对租房者的影响，包括在上周的播客中，但该法案的一个部分与**皮尔区**（Peele region：安大略省的一个区域自治市，包括布兰普顿、密西沙加和卡利登）的水务基础设施有关，这让一些人敲响了警钟。现在，杰西卡，你将做一些通常是我的工作的事情。试着让市政政策变得有趣。那么，谁对布兰普顿和密西沙加的下水道如此激动呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Bill 60, the Fighting Delays Building Faster Act, passed its third reading at the legislature on Monday. We've talked about the impact of Bill 60 on renters before, including in last week's podcast, but one section of the bill has to do with water infrastructure in Peele region, and it's got some people raising alarm bells. Now, Jessica, you get to do uh something that is usually my job here. Uh try to make municipal policy interesting. So, who is so exercised about sewers in Bmpton and Missaga?</p>
</details>

Jessica Smith Cross: 是的，我做不到你做的那样，那只是你的特长，但很棒。我能说的是，新民主党和其他团体正在对这项法案的这一部分表示担忧。他们担心这可能导致水务私有化，比如将水务服务出售给私人公司，谋取暴利，然后引发水安全问题，提到了**沃克顿**（Walkerton：安大略省的一个小镇，曾于2000年发生严重的水污染事件，导致多人死亡和生病，成为公共卫生领域监管不力的代名词）。政府表示：“不，绝对不会。绝不可能。我们没有这样做，也不会这样做。这是关于为水和废水输送创建一个公有公司模式，重点是公有，而不是私人公司。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I can't do what you do as you do it. That's just a you thing, but it's great. Uh what I can say, uh the NDP and other groups are raising concerns about this part of this bill. They are worried that it could re result in privatizing water and like selling off water services to private companies, profitering, and then water safety issues, bringing up Walkerton. Um the government is saying, "No, absolutely not. No way, no how. That is not what we're doing and it's not where we're going. This is about creating a publiclyowned corporate model for water and wastewater delivery with an emphasis on publiclyowned, not a private company.</p>

John Michael McGrath: 有些人可能不记得沃克顿是什么，但那是在90年代，我相信是布鲁斯县的一个小镇，那里发生了水安全、水处理的故障。许多人生病了，现在，你知道，我认为我们通常用它来简称公共卫生领域监管不当的危险。所以，正如你所说，政府一直坚持这不是关于私有化，水系统将保持公有。但这里提出的一个担忧，一个《第60号法案》中奇怪的小细节是，安大略省的市政法律中已经有一个条款允许创建这类公司来处理政府在这里为水系统考虑的工作。而《第60号法案》要求这家将要成立的新水务公司，它将处理皮尔区的水和下水道服务，将根据《**商业公司法案**》（Business Corporations Act：规范公司成立、运营和解散的法律）注册成立。现在，一家公司可以根据《商业公司法案》注册成立，但仍然是公有的。所以这并不能证明最终目标是私有化任何东西，但这正是批评者在这里提出的细节。比如，如果你的最终目标不是邪恶的，为什么要重新发明轮子呢？再说一遍，我不认为这能证明情况，但这是正在提出的担忧之一。听众可能不清楚的一件事是，为什么是皮尔区？为什么我们现在对皮尔区如此兴奋？

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Some people may not actually remember what Walker uh was, but this was in the '90s, a town in Bruce County, I believe, and uh there there was a failure of uh water safety, water treatment there. uh many people were made sick and uh it's it's now the you know I I think we we commonly use it as a shorthand for uh the perils of uh not properly regulating uh things in uh the public health uh sphere. So, as you say, the government has always maintained that this is not about privatization, that uh the the water system would remain publicly owned. But one of the concerns that has been raised here, one of the the the odd little specific details of Bill 60 is that there was already a section in Ontario's municipal law that allowed the creation of these kinds of corporations to to handle the kind of work that the government is looking at for the water system here. Whereas bill 60 requires that this new water company that will be created and it will handle the water and sewer services in Peele region uh that will be incorporated under the business corporations act. Now a company can be incorporated under the business corporations act and still be publicly owned. So it doesn't prove that the ultimate goal is to privatize anything but that is like the kind of detail that the critics are raising here. Like why reinvent the wheel if your aim is not ultimately uh something nefarious? Uh again I don't think that that proves the case but that's one of the concerns that is being raised. One of the things that might not be clear to to listeners here is why in Peele region? Why are we so excited about Peele region right now specifically,</p>
</details>

Jessica Smith Cross: 对吗？所以，让我们回顾一下，做一个非常简短的胶囊历史。我们当然记得福特省长曾向已故的**黑兹尔·麦卡利恩**（Hazel McCallion：密西沙加市的长期市长）承诺，他将解散皮尔区。然后，当**邦妮·克朗普比**（Bonnie Crombie）成为自由党领袖时，他食言了。但是他们启动了这个过程，真正重新思考皮尔区的所有市政治理。所以现在，皮尔区有点像这个省的实验室，可以进行实验，因为这种奇怪的历史。那么，我们为什么关心皮尔区的水务服务呢？答案是，水务基础设施是**开发费用**（development charges：市政当局向开发商征收的费用，用于支付新开发项目所需的基础设施成本）的主要驱动因素之一。嗯，你知道，我很久以前查过这个，我很抱歉我忘记了，但肯定我认为在区域层面，下水道和水务服务是皮尔区新住宅开发费用征收中最大的一部分。所以这是一方面。显然，开发费用的价值是这个政府一直在讨论的一个大问题，你知道，试图减少开发费用之类的。但同时，水务基础设施建设的延误也会阻碍新住宅的建设。所以，你知道，这是政府试图至少部分解决住房问题，并可能创建一个可以在该省其他地方复制的模型。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> right? So, let's go back and just do very brief capsule history here. We can remember of course Premier Ford made a promise to the late Hazel Mallen uh longtime mayor of uh Missaga that he would dissolve Peele region. Uh then he reneged on that promise when Bonnie Krombi became leader of the Liberal Party. Um but they set up this process of really rethinking all of the the the municipal governance in Peele region. And so now at the moment Peele is a bit of this lab for the province to experiment on because of that kind of odd uh history. Uh so but why do we care about water services in Peele region? And the answer there is because water infrastructure is one of the big drivers of development charges. Um it is what uh you know I I I did look this up a while ago and I I apologize because I've forgotten it but certainly I think at the the regional level sewer and water services are like the biggest part of the development charge uh levy uh for new homes in Peele region. So that's one side of it. Obviously the the uh value of development charges a big issue that this government has talked about uh you know trying to reduce development charges that kind of thing. uh but also just the delays in building water infrastructure can hold up the uh construction of new homes. So, you know, uh this is uh the government trying to address uh at least in part uh a a housing issue and potentially create a model that might be replicated elsewhere in the province.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 所以，基本上，这个想法是看看这种他们将尝试的新模式在皮尔区是否奏效，看看这是否能帮助我们更快、更便宜地获得水务基础设施。我不知道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, basically the idea is see if this works in Peele region, this new mount model that they're going to try, see if that helps us get the water infrastructure faster, cheaper. I don't know.</p>
</details>

Jessica Smith Cross: 是的。更快、更便宜，而且还有一些政治价值。希望是将其从房产税基中剥离出来。这里的想法是，一家公司，就像你知道的，一家公司运营你的电话服务、互联网服务、电力一样。与其让这家水务公司从房产税收入中获得报酬，不如完全由用户付费和一些附带成本来支付。所以，它确实又回到了住房问题上，就像大多数事情一样，不是吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Faster, cheaper, and also uh some political value. Probably the hope is in taking it off of the property tax base. Uh and the idea here is that a a a single company in much the same way that like you know a a company runs your phone service, your internet service, uh your electricity. um instead of having this water company paid for out of property tax uh revenues that it would be paid for purely um uh by uh user charges and some of the costs on the side. So it does come back to housing with mo as most things do with you don't they?</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 是的，我无法摆脱它，我也停止了尝试。但是，是的，一切总是回到住房问题上。接下来是第三个问题。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Yeah I I cannot escape it and I have stopped trying. Uh but yes it all comes back to housing always. And with that on to issue three.</p>

### 展览广场的未来与《第68号法案》

在《**第68号法案**》（Bill 68：Plan to Protect Ontario Act，一项关于安大略省土地使用和规划的法案）的文本中，即《保护安大略法案》，有一些关于**展览广场**（Exhibition Place：位于多伦多市中心的一个大型会展和娱乐综合体）的细节。本质上，该文本将赋予省政府对该场地的控制权。这引起了反对党的警报，他们称之为“土地掠夺”。政府此后明确表示，该立法将仅用于更换水管和电线等基础设施。杰西卡，我们还需要知道什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Within the text of bill 68 the plan to protect Ontario act were some details about exhibition place. Essentially the text would give the province control over the grounds. This has raised alarm bells with the opposition who called it a land grab. The government has since specified that the legislation will be used just to replace infrastructure like water pipes and wires. What else should we know here, Jess?</p>
</details>

Jessica Smith Cross: 嗯，这个故事让我想起了我们之前讨论的那个故事。听我说完。我们时不时会在安大略省的政治中遇到这些问题，这些故事中存在着巨大的鸿沟，即政府可以通过一项立法做什么，它正在以某种方式赋予自己做什么的权力，以及它实际想做什么，然后它的批评者和反对党认为它的最终目标实际上是什么。作为记者，我们有点挣扎着想知道现实在哪里？这里发生了什么？所以这是其中一个故事。而且我认为，当政府与反对党以及那些敲响警钟的团体之间缺乏信任时，我们就会看到这些巨大的鸿沟，这些鸿沟存在于实际可能发生的事情的不同版本之间。所以，我们来了。嗯，一位新民主党省议员发布了一份相当激动的新闻稿，称政府将夺取展览广场的控制权。所以这立即导致人们认为，他们这样做唯一的目的就是最终建造我们一直知道他们计划建造的那个赌场。这方面没有太多证据，但你知道，这种怀疑已经存在很长时间了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, this story reminds me of the last story that we talked about. Hear me out. Every so often we get these issues, these stories in Ontario politics where there's a massive gap between what the government could do with a piece of legislation, what it's empowering itself to do in some way and what it actually wants to do and then what its critics and the opposition parties believe its end goal is actually to do. And we're as journalists sort of left struggling to be like where's the reality? What's what's going on here? So this is one of those stories. Uh, and I think we get this these huge gaps between what is actually versions of what might be happening when there's not a lot of trust between the government and the opposition parties and the and the groups that are ringing alarm bells. So, here we go. Uh, an NDP MPP came out with a fairly breathless press release saying that the government was going to seize control of exhibition place. And so immediately that led to people being like the only way they're doing it that's finally gonna finally build that casino that we've always known that they've been planning to build. Not a lot of evidence for that but you know that's been the suspicion for a long time. Right. So</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 对，该法案确实为省议员提供了依据，可以说政府可以利用这一点来控制安大略广场。它确实赋予了政府更多的权力，抱歉，是在安大略广场重建的背景下，对展览广场的权力。它允许政府做更多它声称想做的事情，而不仅仅是，你知道，在铺设管道和电线以及加快开发时让事情进展更快。所以，我们又来了，政府说：“我们只是为了这个目的。”但法案说他们可以做更多，而且人们对政府是否会仅仅按照他们所说的目的来使用这项立法缺乏信任。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> right the bill there is grounds for the MPP to say that the government could use this to to take control of Ontario place. really does give the government more power, sorry, over exhibition place uh in the context of the Ontario place redevelopment. It it allows it to do more than it has said it wants to do, which is just, you know, make things go faster when they're doing things like laying pipes and and wire and expediting development. So, here we are again, the government saying, "We just want it for this." the bill says they could do much more and there's not a lot of trust in the government for only doing what they say they want to do with this legislation that they're doing.</p>
</details>

Jessica Smith Cross: 而且你知道，当新民主党提出他们的主张时，政府并没有及时或迅速地澄清事情，不是吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And you know, when you know the the NDP uh made their claims and then the government didn't exactly clarify things uh promptly or or quickly as fast as they could have, did they?</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 是的。不，那有点混乱。我们问了诸如“你为什么需要这个？”之类的问题，得到的回答是：“等等，我们会给你一个模糊的声明，但实际上并没有回答任何问题。”当这种情况发生时，它不会产生很多信任。而且他们也没有与市政府沟通，市政府对此措手不及。而且市政府显然是展览广场所有事情的重要合作伙伴。所以，不，这并没有帮助平息恐惧和混乱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. No, it was a bit of a mess. We asked questions like, "Why do you need this?" And it was like, "Hold on, we'll get back to you vague statement that didn't actually answer any of those questions." And when that happens, it doesn't breed a lot of trust. And they also hadn't looped in the city, which was caught off guard. Uh and the city's obviously a huge partner in all things exhibition place. So no, that didn't help with this keeping down the the the fear and confusion.</p>
</details>

现在，你提到这一切都发生在**安大略广场**（Ontario Place：位于多伦多湖滨的一个娱乐和文化场所，目前正在进行大规模重建）重建的背景下。上周《三叶草报》的查理·平克顿报道称，安大略广场的重建实际上可能比政府声称的要长得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Now, uh you mentioned this is all happening in the context of the Ontario Place redevelopment. Uh Charlie Pinkerton at the Trillium reported last week that that redevelopment, the Ontario Place redevelopment, could actually take substantially longer than the government has been claiming.</p>
</details>

Jessica Smith Cross: 是的，他做了一些信息自由请求，获得了一些简报文件，其中提到**温泉水疗中心**（Thurma Spa）的建设期应为24个月，并有可能延长至9年，这要长得多。这是否意味着需要更长的时间，11年，9年或更长时间？不一定。但政府正在为如果真的需要那么长时间会发生什么做计划，结果是这将花费一些钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, he he did some uh FOI requests and got some briefing documents that said the construction period for the Thurma Spa should be 24 months with potential extensions up to 9 years, which is a lot longer. Does that mean it's going to take more time, 11, nine years or something? Not necessarily. But the government is planning for what would happen if it does take that long and it would cost the some money is the upshot of that.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 对。我想在这里补充一个背景信息。你提到他们没有与市政府沟通，这很重要，因为多伦多市拥有展览广场。当省政府在天哪，那是什么时候，2011年或2012年关闭安大略广场时，这个决定最终非常简单，因为省政府在安大略广场上亏钱。没有人真正相信，至少在当时的麦金蒂政府内部，没有人相信一个政府运营的游乐园有盈利的途径。嗯，从那以后，安大略广场故事中的所有曲折，我认为，很大程度上是因为温德政府想方设法利用这块土地赚钱，你知道，多伦多市中心的海滨土地。嗯，你知道，我当然知道省长正在从财政部获得建议，关于如何将其变成一项能为安大略省人民带来收入的资产。当然，这发生在温德执政期间巨额赤字的背景下。嗯，但是，你知道，她受到了各种交叉压力，对吧？一方面，你希望以一种赚钱的方式重建安大略广场，但另一方面，投票给自由党的市中心多伦多居民不想要赌场。他们不想要公寓。嗯，一旦你排除了该空间的大部分住宅或商业用途，你就没有太多事情可做了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Right. Uh one additional point of context that I I want to throw in here. You mentioned that like they didn't loop in the city and that's kind of a big deal because the city of Toronto owns Exhibition Place when the province shut down Ontario Place in gosh what was that 2011 2012. You know the the decision was ultimately very simple because the province was losing money on Ontario Place. Nobody really believed, at least in government, uh, in the then McGinty government, uh, nobody believed that there was a path back to profitability for a a government-run amusement park. Um, and all of the twists and turns in in the Ontario Place story since then, I would argue, you know, were largely because the wind government wanted to try and figure out some way to make money off of this land, you know, waterfront land in downtown Toronto. Uh it it you know certainly I I know the premier was getting advice from the the the finance ministry about how to you know turn that into uh an asset that would produce money for the people of Ontario. Of course this is in the context of big deficits uh during the win years. Um, but you know, she was she was getting all sorts of cross pressure, right? On the one hand, you want to uh redevelop Ontario Place in in a way that makes money, but on the other hand, uh downtown uh Toronto residents who vote liberal did not want a casino. They did not want condos. Um and once you rule out a lot of the either residential or commercial uses for that space, you just there's not a lot left to do.</p>
</details>

Jessica Smith Cross: 所以安大略广场没有发生太多事情。然后道格·福特在2018年获胜，很多不同的事情开始发生。总之，所有这些背景都说明，这并不是展览广场正在发生的事情。多伦多市拥有展览广场，我不知道它是否每年都从展览广场赚钱，但总的来说，它是一项为城市带来收入的资产。会议中心非常繁忙。我认为它是加拿大最大，如果不是最大的会议中心之一。这与安大略广场完全不同。这是市政府非常清楚自己想做什么，并希望保留的资产。所以当你开始对省政府可能接管展览广场敲响警钟时，多伦多市政府，并非不合理地，会非常恐慌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And so not a lot happened at Ontario Place. And then Doug Ford wins in 2018 and a lot of different things start happening. Anyway, that is all context to say this is not what is happening at Exhibition Place. The city of Toronto owns Exhibition Place and I don't know if it makes money off of Exhibition Place every single year, but in general it's it is a a asset that pays money into the city. Uh the convention center is very busy. It's I think the one of the largest, if not the largest convention center in Canada. It is just a totally different story from Ontario Place. That is a a an asset that the city very much knows what it wants to do with, wants to hang on to. And so when you start ringing alarm bells about uh the the potential provincial takeover of Exhibition Place, the city of Toronto, not unreasonably, freaks right out.</p>

### 安大略省的游说文化：旧疾还是新常态？

<p class="english-text">If you've got a burning question or insightful comment, you can always send it along to us at onp politicsvo.org. And uh this week, Jessica, you get to read uh the letter uh uh guests privilege. What do we have?</p>
</details>

Jessica Smith Cross: 这是来自贝尔维尔的听众**斯科特·朱鲁**（Scott Juru）发来的邮件，他写信给我们，内容是关于一篇《三叶草报》的文章。我在这里真是太巧了。你好。我是这个节目的忠实粉丝。这是一篇来自《三叶草报》的有趣文章，内容是关于市政当局在2024年使用福特/进步保守党游说者为其市政当局办事。这似乎与技能发展基金以及其他省级项目的方法/行为相当一致。我的问题是，安大略省一直都是这样运作的吗？使用以前在政府工作过的游说者，或者省议员/影子省长萨吉·坎德拉的朋友，是办事的最佳方式吗？你能比我更好地解释这个问题，并深入挖掘史蒂夫的记忆，看看这种游说方式是否是过去政府的常态，还是这在很大程度上是前所未有的？——来自安大略省贝尔维尔的斯科特·朱鲁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Here's an email from listener Scott Juru in Belleville who writes to us about a Trillium article. How convenient that I'm here. Hello. Big fan of the show. Here is an interesting article from the Trillium on municipalities using Ford/PC lobbyists to get things done for their municipality in 2024. This seems to be rather consistent methods/behavior with the skills development fund as well as other provincial programs. My question is, is this the way things have always worked in Ontario that using lobbyists formerly of the government or friends of MPP/theshadow Premier Saj Kandra's friends is the best way to get things done. Could you explain the issue better than I and dig deep into Steve's memories to see if this style of lobbying is the norm for past governments or is this mostly unprecedented from Scott Juru in Belleville, Ontario?</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 所以，我们今天无法深入挖掘史蒂夫的记忆，但我们可以深入挖掘我们自己的记忆。但在那之前，我们实际上可以深入挖掘《三叶草报》的报道。再次，我们将引用超级明星查理·平克顿。这是他大约一年前的一个故事。杰西，你能给我们讲讲这个故事吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, we can't dig into Steve's uh memories today, but we can dig into our own. But before we do that, we can uh actually dig into the Trillium's reporting here. Uh again, we're going to reference uh superstar Charlie Pinkerton. This is a story of his from about a year ago. Um, Jess, can you take us through the story?</p>
</details>

Jessica Smith Cross: 是的，我们这里需要第三把椅子。这个故事是关于安大略省布莱顿的。该市需要基础设施资金来解决水系统问题。它决定聘请一家游说公司，**阿特拉斯战略顾问公司**（Atlas Strategic Advisers）。这是一家由**阿明·马苏迪**（Amin Massudi）经营的公司，他曾是道格·福特的得力助手。所以这些议员们在议会中公开讨论这件事，好像没有人听到一样。但有人听到了，实际上不是查理。他不会随意收听市政委员会会议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, we need a third chair here for uh the story was about Brighton, Ontario. The city needed infrastructure funding to fix issues with its water systems. Uh, and it decided to hire a lobbying firm, Atlas Strategic Adviserss. Uh, that's a firm run by Amin Massudi, who was once Doug Ford's right-hand man. Uh, so what they did, these counselors, is they talked about this openly in council as if no one was listening. Um, but someone was, and it actually wasn't Charlie. He doesn't just listen in to random city council meetings.</p>

<p class="english-text">>> we should keep that thread out there.</p>
</details>

Jessica Smith Cross: 有一个当地人，他有一个时事通讯，并在那里的政治中有所参与，她把他们的评论曝光了，这些评论是安大略省政府在光天化日之下说的，说该镇正在聘请一名游说者来做幕后工作，而不是聘请具有技术专长的人。不，我们有这个，这是一个幕后人员，因为安大略省的事情就是这样办成的。这些议员们就是这么说的。所以在**皇后公园**（Queens Park：安大略省议会的所在地，常代指安大略省政府）引起了很大的争议。你知道，你需要聘请一家与省长关系密切的公司才能办成任何事情的想法，是反对党抓住不放的，而政府则极力否认。最终，该镇和阿特拉斯停止了合作。该镇在那一轮中没有获得所需的资金。但关于读者来信中提出的这个问题是否是新问题。嗯，政府出现道德丑闻并不是什么新鲜事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There was uh a local person who had like a newsletter and had some involvement in politics there and she brought their the comments to light which was stuff that the the Ontario government shed in light saying that the town was hiring a lobbyist to work the backroom not somebody for their technical expertise is no we have that this is a backroom guy because this is how stuff gets done in Ontario. That's what these counselors were saying. So big controversy at Queens Park. Uh you know the idea that you need to hire a firm close to premier to get anything done was something the opposition latched on to and the government vehemently rejected. Uh ultimately the town and Atlas stopped working together. Uh the town didn't get the funding it wanted in that round. But the idea of whether this is new that the reader that the letter writer asked about. Um it's not new for a government to have an ethics scandal.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 嗯，在安大略省要办成事情，你需要一个关系网很广的人，或者你自己就是这样的人，这与政府因技能发展基金而陷入困境的原因是同一种想法。对于这个政府来说，这自其执政初期就一直是一个问题，从整个**迪安·弗伦奇**（Dean French：道格·福特的前幕僚长，曾因裙带关系丑闻辞职）的裙带关系事件开始。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Um the the idea that to get something done in Ontario, you need a well-connected person or to be a well-connected person is the same kind of idea that the government's getting in trouble for over the skills development fund. And it's sort of been an issue for this government since its early days with the whole Dean French patronage.</p>

<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>

Jessica Smith Cross: 嗯，但总的来说，这对于任何政府来说都不是新鲜事。比如，我来到皇后公园时，正是自由党政府因当时的**现金换取接触丑闻**（cash for access scandal：指政党通过举办高价晚宴等活动，让企业捐助者有机会与部长级官员直接接触，从而影响政策）而受到抨击的时候。这涉及与企业捐助者举行大型晚宴，让他们有机会与部长们面对面交流，自由党因此在筹款方面占据主导地位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um but no, in general, this is not new for any government ever. Like I came to Queens Park when it was the Liberal government under fire for what they called the cash for access scandal of the day. This was big dinners with corporate donors getting facetime with ministers and the liberals dominating fundraising because of this.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 是的。部长们被赋予明确的筹款目标，甚至，你知道，匿名向媒体抱怨他们的筹款目标有多么繁重之类的。嗯，不，正如你所说，你知道，我甚至可以，你知道，即使你只想狭隘地谈论游说。我记得其中一个让我印象深刻的是，嗯，一位前自由党交通部长的前助手去特斯拉工作，过了一段时间，政府修改了其**电动汽车补贴**（EV subsidies：政府为鼓励电动汽车销售而提供的财政激励措施），以一种有利于特斯拉的方式，对吧？嗯，这些事情并非闻所未闻，并非新奇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. Ministers being given like explicit fundraising targets uh and and even you know complaining to the press anonymously about how ownorous their fundraising uh targets were that kind of thing. Um, no, as you say, like, you know, I I could, you know, even if you want to just talk narrowly about lobbying. I remember one of the ones that sticks in my mind was, um, a former aid for a Liberal Minister of Transportation went to go work for Tesla and some interval later, the government revised its EV subsidies uh, in a way that benefited Tesla, right? um these things are not uh unheard of, not novel.</p>
</details>

但我想说两点。第一，我的感觉是，嗯，它至少没有那么明目张胆，而且还没有渗透到市政当局，你知道，我不记得温德时代有任何故事，例如，市政当局在议会公开会议上说，你知道，与政府做生意的唯一方式就是聘请游说者。嗯，我认为另一件更有趣的事情是，展望未来，嗯，对于进步保守党和坦率地说，对于全国各地的保守党来说，这些事情正在与政府一起上演的方式。与游说者的亲近，嗯，不仅仅是一个，嗯，一个关于良好公共治理、公平和透明度以及所有这些事情的问题，我们作为记者显然会继续关注，但它也是进步保守党内部的一个问题，对吧？道格·福特党内有些人对政府的这一整个元素非常反感，嗯，你知道，其中一些是个人恩怨，对吧？你知道，有些人不喜欢那些最接近省长的人，诸如此类，然后，你知道，总会有那种抱怨，嗯，但有些人确实觉得，你知道，嗯，政策正在被省长与这些游说者的亲近所扭曲，你知道，我想如果我们前段时间邀请马特·斯波克（Matt Spoke）来播客，嗯，你知道，我称他为**保守党异见者**（Tory dissident：指对保守党主流路线或领导层持不同意见的成员），嗯，他试图，你知道，嗯，让党朝着不同的方向发展。嗯，是的，政府与游说者之间的关系绝对是这个问题的全部内容，即，你知道，保守党希望他们的党成为什么样的保守党，有些人正在审视道格·福特的成果，并且不喜欢他们所看到的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">But I guess I would say two things. one, my sense is that um it it at least was not quite so blatant and it it had not percolated all the way to municipalities where that you know I I don't remember any stories um from the from the wind era for example where municipalities were saying uh in open meetings at council certainly uh that you know the only way to to you know do business with the government was to uh hire a lobbyist. Um and the other thing that I think is going to be more interesting looking forward uh both for uh the PC party and and for conservatives frankly around the country is the way that these things are playing out with the government. the the the proximity to lobbyists um is not just a uh uh a question of you know good public government and and and fairness and transparency and all uh those things which obviously we as journalists will continue to to keep an eye on but it is also an issue within the PC party right there are people within Doug Ford's party who are very put off by uh this whole element of government um and uh you know some of this is personalities right you know there are people who don't like some of the the people who are closest to the premier that kind of thing and then you know there's always that kind of grumbling um but there are people who sort of genuinely feel like you know uh policym is being dis distorted by the the the proximity of uh the premier to these lobbyists and you know I think if we had Matt spoke on the podcast a while back uh you know he's I would call him like a Tory dissident uh trying to you know um move the party in a different direction. Uh and and yeah, like the the relationship between the government and lobbyists is absolutely all in this mix of this question of what you know, what kind of conservatives do conservatives want their party to be and there are some who are looking at the results of Doug Ford and and not liking what they're seeing.</p>

Jessica Smith Cross: 是的。**安大略项目**（Project Ontario：一个保守派团体，旨在推动安大略省的保守主义原则）的人们，他们会把自己描述为比进步保守党政府更保守。是的。他们对他们的道德非常批判，就像你可能会发现新民主党的评论一样批判，这总是很有趣。
