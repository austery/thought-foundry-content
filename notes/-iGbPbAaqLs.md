### 校园急需重新设计。以下是方法｜Aylon Samouha｜TED

### 打破围墙的真实学习

你从未见过这样的学校。在布鲁克林海军造船厂的中心，被起重机、初创公司和设计工作室环绕着，年轻人们不只是坐在教室里。他们正在为小企业策划数字营销活动，正在为真实的房屋铺设电路。在大厅的另一头，一位名叫 Natalia 的学生正在网络安全专家的指导下，安全地进行网站攻防演练。这些学生是 **Brooklyn Steam Center**（布鲁克林STEAM中心：一所位于纽约的创新型公立高中，侧重于职业技术教育）的一员。这所公立高中看起来、感觉起来更像是一个工程工作室，而不是传统的教室。在这里，他们不仅能获得大学预科文凭和行业证书，还在建立职业人脉，同时发掘自己在现实世界中的特长。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

You've never seen a school like this. In the middle of the Brooklyn Navy Yard, surrounded by cranes, start-ups, design studios, young people aren't just sitting in classrooms. They're creating digital marketing campaigns for small businesses, wiring real houses. Down the hall, a student named Natalia is hacking websites, safely, with the guidance of cybersecurity pros. (Laughter) These students are part of the Brooklyn Steam Center, a public high school that looks and feels more like an engineering studio than a traditional classroom. They're earning college-ready diplomas and industry credentials. They're building professional networks while discovering what they're good at in the real world.

</details>

这一切并非偶然发生。我领导着一个名为 **Transcend** 的学校设计组织。当我们开始与布鲁克林社区合作时，我们的第一步并不是引入一套现成的方案，而是倾听。学生、家庭、教育工作者和当地雇主都告诉了我们同样的事情：我们想要那种能真正连接孩子们未来将要进入的世界的学习方式。因此，我们与学校的创始人一起，将数十年的实践与研究、职业关联学习、项目式学习以及目标发展（purpose development）编织在一起。结果如何？一种严谨、相关且引人入胜的学习体验诞生了。它不是关于死记硬背内容，而是关于解决实际问题；不是问“为了考试我需要知道什么？”，而是问“我能构建什么有意义的东西？”当你亲眼看到它时，会觉得显而易见：学校当然应该长这样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And none of it happened by accident. I lead a school design organization called Transcend. And when we began working with the Brooklyn community, our first step wasn't to bring in a program. It was to listen. Students, families, educators, local employers all told us the same thing: we want learning that actually connects to the world kids are growing into. So with the school's founders, we stitched together decades of practice and research, career-connected learning, project-based learning, purpose development. The result? A learning experience that's rigorous, relevant and engaging. Not about regurgitating content but about solving real problems. Not "What do I need to know for the test?" But "What can I build that matters?" And when you see it, it feels obvious. Of course, school should be like this.

### 告别“工厂模式”

但如果这如此显而易见，为什么我还要站在这个舞台上告诉你们这些？当大多数学生从未有机会以这种方式学习时，我们付出了什么代价？Transcend 最近对全美 70,000 名学生进行了调查。只有不到一半的人说他们喜欢学校，三分之二的人说学校很无聊。只有不到 4% 的人表示他们有机会探索并掌控自己的学习。而且学生年龄越大，情况越糟糕。近四分之三的三年级学生说他们喜欢学校，但到了高中，只有勉强四分之一的人这么说。数据只是告诉了我们每个家长都已经知道的事情。你问：“今天学校怎么样？”你只听到一个词：“还行（Fine）。”但“还行”并不代表真的好，那是潜力在悄然消逝的声音。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

But if it's so obvious, why am I on this stage telling you about it? And what does it cost us when most students never get to learn this way? Transcend recently surveyed 70,000 students across the US. Less than half said they loved school. Two thirds said it's boring. Less than four percent said they get a chance to explore and be in charge of their own learning. And the older students get, the worse it gets. Nearly three quarters of third-graders say they love school, but by high school, barely a quarter say they do. And the data is just telling us what every parent already knows. You ask, "How was school today?" And you hear one word. "Fine." But "fine" isn't fine. It's the sound of potential quietly fading.

</details>

这里有一个我们大多数人没有大声说出来的真相：学校并没有坏。它正在精确地执行它在一个多世纪前被设计出来的任务。它是为工业时代建立的，旨在标准化、分流并让年轻人为可预测的工作做好准备。它在那个时代是奏效的：识字率上升了，中产阶级壮大了。但今天，我们的毕业生不再是走向流水线。他们正步入一个被 AI 重塑的世界，在这个世界里，能否蓬勃发展取决于你知道你是谁，能否辨别事实与虚构，是否懂得如何持续学习、创造、协作，以及确实地与他人共存。这就是为什么我相信，我们的任务不仅仅是改善学校，而是为了一个新的目的重新设计它们。这个目的要配得上每个年轻人在 K-12 教育中花费的 15,000 小时，这个目的将塑造我们的民主本身。正如我的导师所说，今天在课堂上发生的事情，就是明天社会将要发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Here's the truth most of us don't say out loud. School isn't broken. It's doing exactly what it was designed to do over a century ago. It was built for the factory age to standardize, sort and prepare young people for predictable jobs. It worked for the time. Literacy rose, the middle class grew. But today, our graduates aren't heading to assembly lines. They're stepping into a world being reshaped by AI, where thriving depends on knowing who you are, discerning fact from fiction, knowing how to keep learning, creating, collaborating and, indeed, co-existing with others. That's why I believe our task isn't merely to improve schools, it's to redesign them for a new purpose. A purpose worthy of the 15,000 hours every young person spends in K-12 schooling. A purpose that shapes our very democracy. Because, as my mentor puts it, what happens in classrooms today is what will happen in society tomorrow.

### 社区共创设计

但这从未是一件容易的事。几十年来，我们一直被困在两个极端之间：要么是可能忽视当地实际情况的自上而下的改革，要么是往往依赖于英勇却精疲力竭的教育工作者的自下而上的努力。但还有第三条路：**基于社区的设计**（Community-based design：一种将社区成员纳入设计过程，结合本土经验与专业研究的方法）。基于社区的设计汲取了两种方法的精华。它将生活经验的智慧与研究的智慧结合在一起，将社区的资产与经过验证的工具和实践的资产结合在一起，从而做出既人性化又持久的改变。这是将设计思维、研发（R&D）和社区参与应用于学校生活的最佳体现。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

But realizing this vision has never been easy. For decades, we've been trapped between two extremes: top-down reforms that can ignore local realities or bottom-up efforts that often depend on heroic and exhausted educators. But there's a third way. Community-based design. Community-based design takes the best of both approaches. It brings together the wisdom of lived experience with the wisdom of research. The assets of communities with the assets of proven tools and practices to make change that's both human and enduring. It's the best of design thinking, R and D, and community participation applied to the life of a school.

</details>

这就是 Brooklyn Steam 诞生的方式。这也是华盛顿特区的 **Van Ness Elementary**（凡尼斯小学）如何围绕一个简单的理念重新设计学校的方式：当孩子们感到被看见时，他们学得最好。我们汇集了家庭、教育工作者和学区领导，设想一所真正以“全人”（whole child）为中心的学校。在滋养心智、身体和人际关系的同时，直面许多学生带入学校的真实创伤。因此，我们整合了其他环境中的有效实践：用晨圈（Morning circles）代替点名，在严谨的课程中穿插正念休息，将学生归属感看得与考试成绩一样重要。经过数月的试点和迭代，这些碎片汇聚成一个连贯的模型，让每个学生都感到安全、被连接并准备好学习。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

That's how Brooklyn Steam came to be. It's also how Van Ness Elementary in Washington, DC redesigned school around a simple idea. Kids learn best when they feel seen. We brought together families, educators, district leaders to imagine school that truly centered the whole child. Nurturing mind, body and relationships while confronting the real trauma that many students carried into school. So we integrated effective practices from other settings. Morning circles replaced roll call, mindfulness breaks alongside rigorous lessons, measures on student belonging that matter as much as test scores do. After months of piloting and iterating, these pieces came together into a coherent model where every student feels safe, connected and ready to learn.

</details>

当我访问那里时，我看到一个名叫 Jalissa 的七岁孩子在教室里情绪爆发。她的朋友 Amara 温柔地引导她到一个平静的空间，在那里她们一起练习呼吸。几分钟内，Jalissa 就恢复了状态。没有紧张，没有惩罚，对她们俩来说都是一次学习。这就是为什么，即使其他特区学校每年发布数十次甚至更多的停学处分，Van Ness 却一次也没有，并且在阅读和数学方面超过了学区平均水平。今天，四分之一的特区小学正在采用这种方法，并且它正在扩展到全国 100 多所学校。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

When I visited, I saw a seven-year-old named Jalissa who had an emotional outburst in the classroom. Her friend Amara gently guided her to a calming space where they practiced breathing together. Within minutes, Jalissa was back on track. No tension, no punishment, just learning for both of them. That's why, even as other DC schools issued dozens or more suspensions each year, Van Ness issued none and exceeded district averages in reading and math. Today, one in four DC elementary schools is adopting this approach, and it's spreading to more than 100 schools across the country. Yeah. (Applause)

### 激发内在的火花

基于社区的设计在截然不同的地方同样奏效。这就是北达科他州农村的高中生 Matthew 的故事，他在发现锻造工艺后，从在课堂上打瞌睡转变为在各个意义上开辟自己的道路。他的学校已经做好了准备，因为它已经围绕现实世界的学习进行了重新设计，他拥有结构和自由将好奇心转化为手艺，应用数学、科学和设计来建立自己的小企业。现在想象一下，将基于社区的设计与今天的技术相结合。**人工智能**（AI）可以帮助我们加速学习并促进沉浸式体验，激发每个学生的热情，以便成千上万个像 Matthew 这样的学生能够找到他们的目标——只要我们是有目的地进行设计。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And community-based design works in places that couldn't be more different. It's how Matthew, a high school senior in rural North Dakota, went from dozing through class to forging his own path in every sense of the word, after discovering blacksmithing. His school was ready because it had been redesigned around real-world learning, he had the structure and freedom to turn his curiosity into craft, applying math, science and design to building a small business of his own. Now imagine pairing community-based design with today's technology. AI can help us accelerate learning and facilitate immersive experiences that spark every student's passion so that thousands more Matthews can find their purpose. If we design on purpose.

</details>

从布鲁克林到华盛顿特区再到北达科他州，在全国 500 所学校中，我们看到了当社区围绕年轻人实际的学习和生活方式来设计学习时会发生什么。当你把学生体验、参与度和动力放在中心位置——不是作为额外的奖励，而是作为驱动原则——一切都会改变。数据支持了这一点。经历过引人入胜、高质量学习的学生成绩更高，出勤率更强，行为问题更少。但魔法不在于数字。它在于当你看到学生意识到以下几点时眼中的火花：“我属于这里”，“我能做到”，“我正在带着目标学习”，“我可以创造出有意义的东西”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

From Brooklyn to DC to North Dakota, in 500 schools across the country, we've seen what happens when communities design learning around how young people actually learn and live. When you put student experience, engagement, motivation, in the center, not as a bonus, but as a driving principle, everything changes. The data backs it up. Students who experience engaging, high-quality learning have higher grades, stronger attendance, fewer behavior issues. But the magic isn't in the numbers. It’s in the spark you see when a student realizes: "I belong here," "I can do this," "I'm learning with purpose." "I can make something that matters."

</details>

我知道我也希望我的孩子能拥有这些。当然，我并不孤单。每一位家长、教育工作者、每一个社区都希望学校能随着周围的世界不断成长。学校不能是我们一个世纪才重新设计一次的东西。我们需要将“基于社区的设计”作为一种肌肉能力，而不是一个项目或倡议；它是内置的（built in），而不是生硬附加的（bolted on）；它是我们共同办学的一种持续进化方式。所以当我们问：“孩子们怎么样了？”让我们确保答案不再是“还行”。让答案成为：“他们很投入，他们正在茁壮成长，而且他们正在改变世界。”谢谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

I know I want that for my own kids. And of course, I'm not alone. Every parent, educator, every community wants schools that keep growing with the world around them. School cannot be something we redesign once a century. We need community-based design as a muscle, not a program or an initiative. Something built in, not bolted on. A continuous way of evolving how we do school together. So when we ask, "And how are the children?" Let’s make sure the answer isn’t “fine.” Let it be, "They're engaged, they're thriving, and they're transforming the world." Thank you. (Cheers and applause)
