title: Affirm创始人Max Levchin深度解析“先买后付”：颠覆传统信贷的创新之路

### 传统信用卡行业的财富转移与“先买后付”的崛起

**Max Levchin:** 说实话，我花了很多时间思考“生态系统”这个词，主要是对此感到愤怒，因为它是一种记录不那么充分的财富转移。顺便说一句，信用卡行业总体上是一种累退的财富转移，那些从不循环交易的人，比如你们两位和我，当我们使用信用卡时（现在已经很少了），我们月底会付清账单，一分钱利息都不付。我想Joe曾公开表示你从未支付过任何利息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So for what it's worth, I spend a lot of my time contemplating the word ecosystem, mostly raging against it because it is one of the less documented wealth transfers. And by the way, the credit card industry in general is a regressive wealth transfer where people who never evolve transactions, like probably both of you and me, when I use credit cards, which is really rare these days, we're paying our bills. At the end of the month, we're not paying a penny of interest. I think Joe on the record saying you've never paid any interest.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 所以我认为，如果你能负担得起，那是一个很好的状态。但告诉人们他们不应该借钱，而应该在月底还清，对于21世纪的支付领域来说，这相当于“何不食肉糜”的说法。美国有很多人会循环欠款。一半的美国人循环着1万美元的债务。所以，这些人会关心奖励的想法是荒谬的。他们不关心奖励，他们关心的是如何支付最低还款额。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I think that's a that's a nice place to be if you can afford it, telling people that they should just not borrow and pay it off at the end of the month is an incredibly let them eat cake equivalent for the 21st century, payments. Lots of people in America revolve. Half the country revolves in a $10,000. And so the idea of those people caring about rewards is sort of preposterous. They do not. They care about making their minimum payment.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 大家好，欢迎收听《Odd Lots》播客的又一期节目。我是Joe Weisenthal。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to another episode of the Odd Lots podcast. I'm Joe Weisenthal and I'm Tracy Alloway.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** Tracy，感觉每个人，无论他们是否想攻击银行，都存在这种努力。我们的许多节目，无论是谈论加密货币、私人信贷还是支付，都有一个目标，一个梦想，那就是削弱一些银行的业务，或者那些与某些传统机构相关的业务。银行似乎仍然做得很好。但人们有一个梦想，认为它们都可以被某种方式“去中介化”（disintermediated away），或者说，它们所做的每一个功能都可以由其他地方做得更好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tracy, it feels like, everybody, whether, they want to come after the banks right there is this effort. So many of our episodes, whether we're talking about crypto, whether we're talking about private credit, whether we're talking about payment, it's this goal, this dream of like, let's chip away at some of these bank businesses or these businesses that were associated with some sort of legacy institutions. The banks, they mostly seem to be doing pretty well still. But there's this dream that they can all be sort of like disintermediated away, or that someone could. Each one of these functions that they do can be better done somewhere else.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 是的。我从事金融新闻工作已经快20年了，这有点疯狂。这让我觉得自己很老，但据我所知，总有人试图重塑银行贷款或支付领域。我想我能看到几个原因。例如，有些支付架构确实很老旧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So let's see, I have been in financial journalism for almost 20 years now, which is kind of crazy. It makes me feel very old, but for as long as I can remember, someone has been trying to either reinvent bank lending or reinvent the payments space. And I guess I can see a few reasons. So like, genuinely, some payment architecture is really old fashioned.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 是的，尤其是在美国，有时你仍然需要写支票来支付某些东西，这让我感到惊讶。美国很长时间都没有芯片卡。信用卡上的芯片等等。但如果你从整体来看支付、借贷和金融市场，它是最大的市场之一，对吧？你谈论的基本上是所有的经济活动。所以如果你能从总的交换或费用中获得一小部分，你就能明白为什么人们对这个领域非常感兴趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Especially in the US where, you know, sometimes you still have to write a check for something. Yeah, blows my mind. And the U.S. didn't get chips for a really long time. Chips and credit cards and stuff like that. But also, if you think about the payment and lending and financial market just in general, it's one of the biggest out there, right? Like you're talking about all the economic activity basically. And so if you can get a tiny slice of that total interchange or fees, then you can see how people, you know, people are really interested in that space, know completely.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 完全正确。我们知道有很多像**金融科技**（Fintech: 利用技术改进或自动化金融服务）公司已经存在很长时间了。我的意思是，一些最早的互联网成功案例，就是关于这个的，这绝对不是什么新鲜事。当然，最早的之一是**PayPal**（一家在线支付系统公司），它认识到互联网将带来各种新的支付机会，以及准点对点和真正的点对点交易等等。PayPal当然仍然是支付基础设施中极其重要的一部分。但确实有很多事情正在发生。但正如你所说，许多公司已经获得了这些小份额，并赚取了巨额财富。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we know that there are a lot of like fintech companies for a long time. I mean, some of the most, you know, the earliest internet success stories, period, were, you know, this is definitely nothing new. And of course, one of the first ever was PayPal, which recognized that with the internet was going to come, all kinds of new opportunities for payments and sort of quasi peer to peer literal, peer to peer, transactions, etc.. PayPal is still, of course, extremely important part of the payments, infrastructure, etc.. But yeah, there's so much going on. But to your point, lots of companies have gotten those little slices and made an incredible fortune.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 是的。我们几个月前也做了一期关于**先买后付**（Buy Now, Pay Later, 简称**BNPL**: 一种允许消费者分期付款的短期融资方式）的节目。这个领域的扩张显然带来了一些有趣的问题。你我讨论过，现在无论你上网去哪里，都会看到至少两三个小按钮，提供分期付款。显然，人们担心的是消费者是否正在承担不必要的信贷。对此有很多讨论。还有他们所承担信贷的透明度问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. We also did an episode on Buy now, pay later, a couple months ago. And there are clearly some interesting questions brought up by the expansion of that space. And you and I talked about how wherever you go on the internet nowadays, you get like, you know, probably at least 2 or 3 little buttons that offer you installment loans on your purchases. And obviously, the concern is whether or not people are taking out credit that they shouldn't necessarily be. There's a big discussion about that. And also the transparency of the credit that they're taking out.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 是的。我们有，你知道，我们稍后会深入探讨，相对于信用卡，BNPL有利有弊。但信用卡的一个特点是，有几十年的数据，我们知道它们是如何使用的，有非常好的风险分析和评分，以及所有这些信用评分等等。BNPL则相对较新。因此，我们对它作为一种资产或功能在不同周期中的表现了解多少？我们对使用BNPL的人群的了解，是否像我们对使用信用卡的人群那样充分？至少，这似乎有点模糊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. This is we have, you know, and we'll get into this there, there are pros and cons, I guess, relative to credit cards. But one thing with credit cards is that there is decades and decades of data on them, and we know how they're used, and there's really good risk profiling and scores and all this and credit scoring and all this stuff. Bnpl is sort of more novel. And so therefore, to what degree do we know how is as an asset or as a function it performs across different, cycles? Do we know the cohort cohort of people who use Bnpl as well as we know the people, the types of people who use credit cards? It seems a little bit, at a minimum, a bit more ambiguous.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 绝对是。我们已经暗示了我们将要谈论的内容。我提到了PayPal，我们谈到了BNPL，我们将与**PayPal Mafia**（PayPal早期员工和创始人组成的非正式团体，后来许多人创办了其他知名科技公司）的原始成员之一进行对话。我们将与Max Levchin交谈。他是Affirm的创始人兼CEO，Affirm是最大的BNPL上市公司之一。Max，非常感谢您来到《Odd Lots》。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Absolutely. Well, we've sort of hinted at what we're going to be talk about. I mentioned PayPal, we talked about Bnpl, we are going to be speaking with one of the original members of the PayPal Mafia. We're going to be speaking with Max Levchin. He's the founder and CEO of Affirm, one of the biggest Bnpl companies publicly traded. Max. Thank you so much for coming on Odd Lots</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 谢谢邀请。我是这个节目的忠实粉丝。谢谢。能来到这里是我的荣幸。谢谢您在录音中这样说。我们总是喜欢听到这些，但我们更喜欢它作为节目的一部分被公开记录。所以，非常感谢。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Thank you for having me. I'm a big fan of the show. Thank you. It's a bit of a privilege to be here. Thank you for saying that on the recording. So we always love hearing it, but we love when it's on the public record as part of the episode. So, thank you so much.</p>

### Max Levchin的个人经历与Affirm的创立初衷

**Joe Weisenthal:** 您是从哪里得到创办Affirm的想法的？是什么促使您这样做的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Where did you get the idea to start a firm? Why did you what what what prompted it?</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 这是一枚双面硬币，两面都源于糟糕的个人经历，实际上与PayPal的故事紧密相连。我16岁时从苏联来到美国。你可以想象，我对借贷和信用之类的东西知之甚少。所以我在18岁上大学时拿到了我的第一张信用卡。我完全不明白我签的是什么，当然也没有阅读细则，上面写着0%星号，不用担心。我借了一大笔钱，用那张信用卡资助了我的第一家初创公司。很快我就陷入了无法负担的债务。初创公司失败了，最终我接到了催收员的恶劣电话，还清了债务。四年或五年后，我把PayPal这家小公司上市了，基本上是一夜之间变得独立富有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But a two sided coin. Both sides bad of personal experience, actually tying neatly to the PayPal story. So I came to the US at 16 from Soviet Union. And so you can imagine I understood very little about borrowing and credit and things like that. And so I got my first credit card on campus at college at 18. Didn't fully understand what I was signing up for, certainly didn't read the fine print where it said 0% asterisk, don't worry about it. Borrowed a bunch of money, financed my first startup from that very same credit card. Promptly got into more that I could afford to pay for. Startup failed, eventually got some nasty calls from collectors, paid it off, and four years later, or five years later, took this little company. PayPal public was basically independently wealthy overnight.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 我去买了一辆我当时觉得理所当然的豪车。在23岁的时候，我想向我当时的女朋友（现在的妻子）炫耀。我是信贷客户。我不仅在发现我应该支付最低还款额时感到完全被欺骗，而且利息会累积到本金中，这个看似很低的**年利率**（Annual Percentage Rate, 简称**APR**: 贷款或投资每年产生的利息率）实际上并非如此。因为我错过了一些特定金额的还款日期，五年后它又一次困扰了我，就像是“哦，顺便说一句，你的信用评级也毁了，所以你什么贷款都拿不到”，即使你自豪地指着报纸上的文章说“公司上市了，最年轻的创始人”等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Went to buy a fancy car that you know, as I originally deserved. At the ripe age of 23, I wanted to show off to my my then girlfriend, now wife, and was the client for credit. And not only did I feel completely screwed by the moment when I found out that you're supposed to make the minimum payment. And by the way, interest accrues into principle, and this seemingly low Apr is actually not what it seems to be. Because I missed some date of the specific amount that I was supposed to pay, it sort of bit me again five years later was like, oh, by the way, wreck your credit rating too, so you can't get a loan for anything, even as you sort of proudly sticking a finger at the article and newspaper saying, you know, the company, public, youngest, whatever, whatever.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 所以这件事在我心里留下了很多年。我的朋友们会在餐馆里恶作剧我，他们会让服务员告诉我我的信用卡被拒了，那时候我已经换了另一张信用卡，我就会脸涨得通红，基本上会想“天哪，又发生了！怎么回事？”你知道，最终我知道那是个玩笑，但我在30多岁的时候才意识到，这更可能是一个玩笑，而不是18岁时信用评分带来的打击。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so that was the thing that stayed with me for years. My friends would prank me at restaurants. They would ask the waitstaff to tell me that my credit card was declined, which by then was a different credit card, and I would turn beet purple and basically be like, oh my God, like it happened again. Like what? And you know, eventually I knew it was a joke, but I was in my mid 30s when I realized that that's now more likely a joke than that credit score bite from 18.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 所以在我30多岁快40岁的时候，我坐下来和一位高中、大学的朋友以及我刚来美国时认识的许多朋友交谈。最终，我们共同建立了一家了不起的公司，并向他们提出了一个显而易见的问题，虽然晚了20年：“我们为什么不尝试解决年轻人使用信用卡时带来的不快呢？”他说：“我不知道，但我们在PayPal在打击欺诈和做所有这些令人惊叹的事情上取得了巨大的成就。我们肯定能更好地为像你18岁和23岁时的年轻人进行信用评分，比现在的情况做得更好。”那就是一个开创性的时刻。几年后，我们创办了Affirm。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so in my late 30s, I sat down with a friend from high school, college and people, you know, I've many of these friends who'd sort of I met when I was just getting my feet wet in America. And ultimately we, you know, we built this amazing company together and asked them the sort of the obvious question, 20 years too late, why didn't we try to fix the yuck that comes with having credit cards? As a young person? And he said, you know, I don't know, but we built so much great. I at PayPal fighting fraud and doing all these really stunning things. Surely we could do a better job scoring credit for young people like you were at 18 and then 23. Then what currently happens? That was sort of the seminal moment. And, you know, a couple of years later we started a firm.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我已经有很多问题了。首先，那是什么车？您买到了吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I have a bunch of questions already. Firstly, what kind of car was it? Did you get it in? And,</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 我不得不付现金。我实际上是电汇的钱，结果是早上8点去经销商那里，最后到了下午5点，你的电汇还没到账，你不能把车开走。当时确实很戏剧化。别评判我，那是一辆黑色的硬顶奔驰敞篷车。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I had to pay cash for it. I actually wired money, and it would begin like an 8 a.m. visit to a dealership. Ended up like, it's 5 p.m.. Your wired hasn't cleared up. You can't drive off this lot. And it did. You know, drama, at the time. Don't judge me. It was a black hardtop Mercedes convertible.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 哦，一点都不评判。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, and no judgment at all.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我有点评判。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm judging a little bit.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 我当时很年轻，非常想给那个现在是我妻子和孩子母亲的女孩留下深刻印象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was really young. I was very much trying to impress the girl who's now my wife and the mother.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 嗯，显然奏效了。奏效了，奏效了，奏效了。好的，另一个问题。我只是想说，我喜欢那些老款奔驰。我想那是我粗略印象中设计很棒的汽车之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it clearly works. It works, it works, it works. Okay, Another question. So I just want to. I love those old those Mercedes. I think that there's one of the if I, if I have some rough conception, no judgment. I think those those are great design cars. Anyway.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我们应该只谈汽车吗？是的，我们可以。好的。您提到了承保过程，在我看来，这应该是BNPL模式与众不同之处，对吧？承保过程更多地由技术驱动，可能更细致入微。请告诉我们，您与信用卡公司或银行等机构有什么不同之处？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Should we just talk about cars? Yeah, we could. Okay. Well, you mentioned the underwriting process, and this, in my mind, is supposed to be what makes the buy now, pay later. Bnpl model different, right? Like the underwriting process is more technologically driven, perhaps more nuanced. Talk to us about what you do differently versus, you know, a credit card company or a bank or someone like that.</p>
</details>

### Affirm的独特承保与商业模式：透明与对齐的利益

**Max Levchin:** 当然。您正在拉动一根需要很长时间才能解开的线。我尽量简洁，但这就是我愤怒的根源。信用卡的核心问题之一是，它们告诉你一些它们实际上不希望你做的事情。信用卡业务模式是利息累积到本金中。所以，你签署的年利率X的指数函数，但你实际上不知道它会让你花费多少，所有这些事实都意味着，当你支付最低还款额或任何你正在支付的款项时，你尚未还清的利息会直接计入本金，并不断复利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure. And you're you're pulling on a thread that's going to take a long time to unwind. I'll try to be pithy, but, this is where the the rage kicks in. So one of the things that happens with credit cards at the very core, they tell you a bunch of things they don't actually want you to do. So a credit card business model is accrual of interest into principle. So this exponential function of your signing up for Apr x, but you don't actually know what's going to cost you, is all the fact that as you make the minimum payments or whatever the payments you're making, whatever you haven't paid off, the interest that you've accrued folds right into the principal and it compounds and compounds and compounds.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 所以你还款的时间越长，成本就越高，这似乎很明显，但对于大多数普通人来说，这是无法预测的。他们喜欢你逾期，因为有固定的滞纳金。你花的钱越少，滞纳金所占的百分比就越高。所以这是一种令人惊叹的商业模式，这就是为什么你们最近有一期节目对这些利率为何如此之高感到困惑。利率本身其实不是问题。问题在于结构。当你将利息计入本金并支付滞纳金时，它可能会异常昂贵。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so the longer you take to pay it back, the more it will cost, which seems obvious, but it's impossible for most mere mortals to predict. And they love it when you're late, because there are late fees which are fixed. And so the less you spend, the higher the percentage the late fee represents. So it's the sort of amazing business model, which is why, you know, one of your recent episodes puzzled over how are these rates so high. The rates themselves are actually not the problem. The problem is the structure. As you fold interest into principle and pay and pay and pay late fees, it can be extraordinarily expensive.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 所以从Affirm成立之初，我们就提出了一个问题：我们如何才能创造一个产品，避免这种奇怪的利益错位，即贷款人告诉你“请按时支付账单”，但他们实际上想说的是“但不要太按时，最好尽可能拖延，因为那样我们才能赚最多的钱”？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so from the very beginning of a firm, we asked the question, how can we make a product where you don't have this weird misalignment of interests, where the lender tells you, please pay your bills on time? But what they're saying sort of is, but not to on time and ideally take as long as possible because that's when we make the most money.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 所以显而易见的答案当然是：制定一个你作为贷款人承诺永不改变的计划，并且不收取滞纳金。就是这样。如果你同意这些设计原则，那么如果有人逾期，你就不会赚更多的钱；如果他们拖延还款，你也不会赚更多的钱。显然，你会赚更少的钱，因为借钱来放贷也不是免费的。我们必须支付资本来源的成本。正如你们和其他所有人一样，这意味着它会立即让你旋转180度，你会说：“我只在非常有信心这个人会按时还款时才放贷，因为如果他们不还，我就会亏钱。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the obvious answer is, of course, obvious. Make a plan that you commit as a lender that you'll never change and don't charge late fees. And that's it. If you agree to those design principles, you are not going to make more money. If someone is late and you're not going to make more money if they take longer to pay you back, obviously you'll make less money because getting money to lend isn't free either. We have to pay for our sources of capital. As you know, as everybody else does, which means that it immediately rotates you sort of 180 degrees where you say, I only want to lend money when I have a lot of conviction. The person is going to pay me back on time, because if they don't, I am just going to lose money.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 所以我们很早就确立了这两个原则。它被字面意义上写进了公司的基石：我们不会与我们的借款人产生利益错位。由此产生了许多事情，比如：我们需要了解你的现金流。我们不关心你的信用评级是什么。也许你操纵了它，也许它不准确。也许你是一个18岁的移民，这都不重要。我们需要了解你实际的还款能力。我们必须有权告诉你，你正在过度消费，这不仅仅是每隔几年更新信用卡协议时才发生，而是对于每一笔交易，你都必须能够进行承保并决定是否批准每一笔你创建的支付计划。因为这能让我们不亏钱，因为我们与你利益一致。当你按时还款时，我们会赚一些钱。如果你不还，我们就会更糟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so we put those two principles down in the ground very, very early on. It's literally written down to the foundation of the company. We will not misalign ourselves with our borrowers. From that came a lot of things like, hey, we need to understand your cash flow. We don't really care what your credit rating is. Maybe you gamed it, maybe it's not accurate. Maybe your 18 year old immigrant does not matter. We need to understand what your actual capability is. We have to have the right to tell you you are overextending yourself, not just once every few years when you renew your credit card agreement, but for every transaction you have to be able to underwrite and decide yes or no for every single moment that you create these payment plans. Because that allows us to not lose money because we are aligned with you. When you pay us back on time, we'll make some money. If you don't, we're just going to be worse off.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 这就是Affirm对BNPL的看法基础。许多人后来也加入了这个领域，并稍微改变了模式。他们引入了滞纳金，各种其他费用，而我们从未这样做，将来也不会。但即使有这些修改，由于这种个性化的承保时刻，这个模式仍然比信用卡更好。在我们的案例中，没有任何形式的费用，这一点需要明确。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so that is the foundation of a firm's take on Bnpl. Many people have come along since and sort of change the model a little bit. They introduce late fees, all kinds of other fees we never have. And never will. But even with those modifications, the model is still better than credit cards because of this individual underwriting moment. In our case, no fees of any kind just to be clear.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 那么，假设我进入某个网站，可能想买一双耐克鞋之类的。我看到了Affirm的选项。您如何在那一刻知道我的信用状况有多好？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So let's say I wind up at some website and maybe I want to buy like some Nike's or something like that. And I see the affirm option. How does how do you know how good of a credit I am in that moment?</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 所以使用Affirm对你来说并非毫不费力。你需要点击Affirm，我们会询问你之前是否使用过。它会要求你提供一些信息。这些信息将允许我们访问信用局为你汇总的标准记录集。如果那里有足够的数据供我们使用自定义信用评分，我们将据此做出决定。如果没有，我们实际上会说：“嘿，我们不完全了解你的个人财务状况。我们想查看你的银行账户现金流，并根据你的现金流入流出情况以及你的还款能力来做出决定。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it's not a effort free thing for you to use affirm. You'll have to click on affirm, and we will ask you if you've ever seen you before. It will ask you to provide some information for us. That information will allow us to tap into the standard set of records that the credit bureaus aggregated about you. If there's enough data there for us to use our custom credit score, we'll render a decision based on that. If there's not, we'll actually say, hey, we don't fully understand your personal financial situation. We would like to have a peek at your bank account, cash flow, and decide how your cash ebbs and flows relative to your ability to pay us back.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 所有这些都得益于非常好的新技术，所以这只需要几秒钟，尽管描述它可能需要同样长的时间。但我们会查看你当前的个人财务状况，并做出决定，不仅是批准与否，还包括你的财务状况发生变化的风险有多大，这会影响信贷定价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All of this is made possible with really good new technology, so this takes seconds, even though it probably takes about as long to do as it takes to describe it. But we'll look through your personal financial state of right now and make a decision, not just whether it's a yes or no, but also how much of a risk you have of that financial situation changing and that price is the credit.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 您是否使用任何创造性的数据点？您提到了根据人们购买的商品类型进行检查。所以我猜这可能很有趣。比如，如果人们分期购买杂货，这是否意味着他们比那些购买电脑或大件商品的人有更高的信用风险？另外，我非常好奇的另一件事，我想我以前在《Odd Lots》上讲过这个故事，但我记得去看一家最终失败的初创公司，他们从事点对点借贷领域，他们描述了他们在承保方面所做的一些事情，比如他们试图通过人们移动贷款滑块的速度来衡量他们的冲动性，这当时让我有点害怕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you use any like, creative data points you mentioned? Checking against like the type of item that people are buying. So that's one thing I imagine could be interesting. Like if people are buying groceries on installment, does that mean they're more of a credit risk than someone who is, I don't know, buying a computer or a big ticket item? And then the other thing I'm very curious about, and I think I've told this story before on all lots, but I remember going to see, a startup that eventually failed, and they were in the peer to peer lending space, and they described some of the stuff they were doing with underwriting, where they were like trying to measure people's impulsiveness by how quickly they moved a slider for a loan and stuff like that, which freaked me out a little at the time.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 那也会吓到我。所以，不，我们不会将**遥测技术**（Telemetry: 远程收集和传输数据的技术）作为承保的输入变量。在我谈论我们实际使用的东西之前，值得一提的是，你在承保中使用的变量是一个受到高度监管的借贷和承保领域。有很多很多法律可以追溯到很久以前，比如《公平信贷法案》（Fair Credit Act）以及联邦和州一级法律的任何后续补充，这些法律禁止你使用一些你不想让人们使用的明显因素，比如你的种族、性别、年龄或信仰。这些都不能成为因素。这样做实际上是联邦罪行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It would freak me out, too. So, no, we do not do, telemetry as a input variable into underwriting. So before I get into what we do use, it bears mentioning that the variables you use in underwriting is a very, very highly regulated domain of lending and underwriting. There's lots and lots of laws going back quite far, things like Fair Credit Act and any other sort of subsequent additions to both federal and state level law that prohibits you from using kind of the obvious things you wouldn't want people to use, like your race or your gender or your age or your creed. Cannot be a factor. It's actually a federal offense to do that.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 所以我们不做任何这些事情。我们甚至会说，如果它与其中一些因素相关，我们也不能使用它。那也是一项后续法律。所以，首先，我们非常非常谨慎，确保我们不踏入**禁止基础**（Prohibited Basis: 贷款和承保中法律禁止使用的因素，如种族、性别等）的领域，这是行业中的专业术语。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so we don't do any of those things. We go as far as to say if it correlates to some of those things, we also couldn't use it. And that too is a subsequent law as well. So, so so first of all, we're very, very thoughtful about making sure we don't step into a prohibited territory. That's called prohibited basis as the, the fancy term in the industry.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 我们可以使用和确实使用的，正如你所提到的，商家会与我们分享正在购买的商品。尽管媒体有时会报道一些关于“墨西哥卷门”的负面新闻，但人们实际上并不会使用Affirm来为墨西哥食物或其他菜肴融资。他们有时确实会用Affirm购买杂货，但它主要或几乎完全用于像“我要举办一个大型派对，需要几百美元的食物，用我的借记卡支付太多了，所以我将使用Affirm”这样的情况。所以我们平均交易额大约是300美元。这让你对人们使用Affirm的用途有一个概念。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What we can use and what we do use, as you mentioned, merchants share with us what's being purchased despite the burrito gate that sometimes, comes back in the press, people don't actually use affirm to finance Mexican food or other cuisines. They do sometimes use affirm for groceries, but it mostly is, or almost entirely really is for things like I'm throwing a giant party and I need several hundred dollars worth of foodstuffs, and that's a lot to pay down with my debit card. So I'm going to use a firm instead. So the average sized transactions for us is roughly $300. So it gives you a sense for like what people use a firm for.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 所以这只是关于它被使用的场合。我们从购买信息中获取的洞察，一个好的心智模型（这是一个近似值，但还不错）是：如果商品的有用寿命明显短于你还清它的时间，你可能会在商品消失很久之后仍然质疑它的质量。所以我们应该问的一个自然问题是，我们对这个商品了解多少？以及这些商品过去的质量历史如何？在我们说“哦，是的，买这个六个月后就会坏掉的东西，然后分两年付款”之前。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that's just, you know, apropos apropos where it's being used, what we glean from the information about what's being purchased, one good mental model, which this is like an approximation, but but a decent one if the useful life of the item is meaningfully shorter than the time it takes you to pay it back, you may find yourself questioning the quality of the item long afterwards disappeared. And so a natural question we should be asking is what do we understand about this item? But also maybe these items history of quality. Before we say, oh yeah, sure, buy this thing that's going to be out in six months and pay for it over two years.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 所以我能说的最有用的事情是，我们引入承保的新变量中，绝大多数，实际上是全部，对我们决策的影响最多只有1%或2%。任何时候有人告诉你“我找到了这个神奇的变量，如果我只看它，承保效果就能提高30%”或者“违约率能降低5%”，他们都在撒谎，可能对自己撒谎多于对你，但他们肯定在撒谎。任何这样的东西，一旦宏观经济现实发生变化，或者人们突然不再关心这个商品，或者他们发现的任何“万能药”突然就失效了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So maybe the most useful thing I can say about actually what variables, what new variables we've introduced into our underwriting a vast, vast, vast majority of them, in fact, all of them actually in influence, a decision we make by 1 or 2% at most. Anytime someone tells you I found this magic variable, and if I just look at that, it's like 30% better underwriting or 5% better defaults. They're lying probably to themselves more than to you, but they're definitely lying. Anything like that just immediately becomes brittle as the macroeconomic reality changes, as people suddenly don't care about the item or whatever it is that they found. As this magic bullet of like, suddenly I know who's a good risk, it just disappears.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 所以你实际上需要大量细微的因素，这些因素也要符合各种规定，帮助你形成一个评分，告诉你这个人还款的可能性有多大。这就是我们所使用的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so you actually want lots and lots of subtle factors that are also compliant with all the various regulations helping you shape a score that will tell you how likely this person is to pay back. And that's what we use.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 让我们回到商业模式的核心。假设有一件100美元的衬衫，我有机会用Affirm购买。所以分四期支付，每期25美元，没有利息。对我来说，这几乎是免费的午餐，因为货币的时间价值等等。我将这笔钱分四期支付。您将获得这100美元，然后我将在第一次付款后获得额外的75美元。所以您赚钱是因为零售商支付给您一部分费用，因为您带来了客户。那么，这部分费用是如何确定的？他们支付给您多少？与其他潜在的BNPL公司或尚未进入市场的新进入者相比，这有多大的竞争力？请告诉我们这部分的定价情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's go back to the just the core of the business model. So let's imagine there is a shirt that costs $100 and I have an opportunity to okay, I'm going to buy it, with a firm. So to be for payments of $25 and there's no interest. And so for me, there is almost a free lunch because the time value of money, etc.. All right. I'm spreading this out over four payments. You're going to get that 100 in an index. And then I'm going to get that extra, that extra $75 after the first payment I'm going to know. And so you make money because the retailer is paying you a cut because that you've brought someone into the door. So talk about how is that gut determined? What how much are they paying you for that? And how competitive is that against other potential Bnpl companies, or perhaps new entrants that haven't come into the market yet? Talk to us about how that prices for them.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 这也是我的问题，因为当你结账时，你会看到按钮。我猜这些按钮对人们来说意义不大，你只是点击其中一个。那么你们如何区分自己呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is my question too, because when you go to check out, you see buttons. And the buttons, I presume don't mean that much to people. You just click one of them. So how do you differentiate yourself?</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 我们已经存在了将近15年，我们区分自己的方式是，我们基本上不打广告。当你结账时看到我们，那就是你了解Affirm的时候，然后你会回来再次使用。我们有令人难以置信的留存率。使用过Affirm几次的人，基本上有90%的概率会回来再次使用Affirm，不一定是在下周。事实上，我们平均每年有超过五笔交易。但当他们需要时，他们会使用Affirm。我们区分自己的方式是，当他们需要我们时，我们就在那里，如果他们遇到困难。我们最好的客户是那些给我们发邮件或打电话说：“嘿，我逾期支付账单了，发生了一些事情。滞纳金是多少？”我们告诉他们没有滞纳金。那一刻他们就明白了我们与行业其他公司有何不同，这可能就是他们如此频繁地回来的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We've been around for nearly 15 years, and the way we've differentiated ourselves by the way we basically don't advertise. When you see us a checkout, that's when you learn about a firm at some point and then you come back to use again. And we have incredible retention rates. People who have used a firm a couple of times, basically with 90% probability, will come back to use a firm again, not necessarily the next week. In fact, we average something like five plus transactions per year. But when it matters to them, they will use a firm. And the way we differentiate ourselves is we were there for them when they needed us and if they ever stumbled. Our best customers are the ones that email us or call us and say, hey, I was late to pay my bill, something happened. What's the late fee? And we tell them there isn't one. That's the moment when they grasp how we're different from the rest of the industry, and that that's probably why they come back to us as often, as much as they do.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 我们约有95%的交易来自回头客。这让你对我们在用户群中培养的忠诚度有一个概念，而我们从未在广播媒体上做出任何承诺。这就是他们回来的原因。回到商业模式这一点。首先，可能值得稍微扩大一下视野。我们提供免息和非免息贷款。Joe描述的支付方式正是如此。在我们的案例中，没有任何形式的费用。所以如果你看到一件100美元的衬衫，你说要分四期支付，每期25美元，就是这样。你不能拖延十年，如果你远远超过还款期限，你很快就无法再使用Affirm了。所以逾期太久的惩罚是：“嘿，你需要在再次使用之前还清我们。”我认为这比“让我们向你收取30美元的滞纳金”更合理。但这并非重点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Something like 95% of our transactions come from repeat customers. So just to give you a sense for the loyalty that we've engendered in our user base without ever making promises, you know, in on broadcast media, that's sort of why they come back to the business model point. So first of all, probably worth expanding the aperture a little bit. So we offer both interest free and not interest free loans. The paying for the Joe described is exactly as it sounds. So in our case there are no fees of any kind. So if you see $100 shirt and you say it's going to be for payments of $25, that is it. You cannot you can take a decade and you wouldn't be able to use affirm pretty soon after you went well past the window of repayment. So the punishment for for being late for too long is, hey, you need to pay us back actually, before you can do this again, which I think stands to reason much more than actually let us hit you with a $30 late fee. But that's beside the point.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 所以这是一种交易形式。我们还有所谓的长期零利率贷款，比如一件1000美元的华丽西装。你可能可以从Affirm获得24个月甚至36个月的贷款，这也将是零利率。在这两种情况下，实际上是零售商支付了你的利息，因为货币的时间价值在六个月后变得更加昂贵。所以你已经抓住了那里的商业模式。在某些情况下，零售商没有足够的利润，或者对支付你的利息不感兴趣。所以他们会说：“看，如果你使用信用卡，你会支付一些利息。如果你使用Affirm，如果消费者愿意向Affirm支付利息，我们就可以进行这笔交易。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that's one form of transaction. We also have what we call longer term zeros, which is for $1,000 fancy suit. You could potentially get a loan from a firm for 24 months or even 36 months, which will also be zero. In both of those cases, it's the retailer that's effectively paying your interest on value of money becomes even more expensive in six months. So you've sort of you've nailed the business model there. In some situations. The retailer just doesn't have the margin or isn't interested in paying your interest. And so they'll say, look, you're going to use credit card, you'll pay some interest. If you're going to use a firm, it's okay for for us to have this transaction happen. If you are willing to pay interest to a firm.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 在那种情况下，你会看到本金和利息，我们会为你计算利率和金额。我们会向你展示还款计划。在你承诺任何事情之前，你将看到并同意我们商定的计划。在后一种情况下，消费者会支付我们一些费用。商家支付给我们的费用可能远低于他们承担利息成本、货币时间价值时支付给我们的费用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And in that scenario, you will see both the principal and interest will calculate for you both the rate and the dollars. And we'll show you the schedule. And before you commit to any of that, you will see and agree to the schedule that we agree on. In the latter case, the consumer is paying us something. The merchant is probably paying us something significantly less than what they're paying us. If they're absorbing the cost of interest, the cost of time, value of money.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 我们的商业模式真的非常简单。在我们的案例中，价值是固定的，所以谁支付我们几乎不重要。这必须覆盖承保、服务所有常规部分的固定成本，为我们留出一点利润，使我们成为一家盈利公司，我们确实是。并且还要承担违约的可能性，顺便说一句，这又回到了激励措施的对齐和简单的检查。比如，这个“当人们遇到困难时你不会盈利”的整个想法奏效了吗？我们的逾期率大约是信用卡行业的一半。这应该让你明白，我们犯的错误并没有那么多。或者说，我们不愿意让人们逾期，因为我们从中得不到好处。回到商业模式，这就是它的运作方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The business model is really, really simple. In our case, to understand the value is fixed, so whoever is paying us almost doesn't matter. That has to cover the fixed cost of underwriting, servicing all the usual bits leave a little bit for us to actually be a profitable company, which we are. And also absorb the probability of default, which, by the way, sort of all the way back to this alignment of incentives and easy check. Like so did it work like this whole idea of like, oh, you know, you're just not going to profit when people stumble. Our delinquency rates are about half the industry of credit cards. That should give you a sense for we don't make nearly as many mistakes. Or perhaps we are not willing to let people go late because we don't benefit from it. Back to the business model. That's how it works.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 这个行业的竞争力就像任何其他支付行业的竞争力一样。支付行业以竞争激烈而闻名。实际上，支付领域从未出现过垄断。这是一个有趣的谜题，我以前在鸡尾酒会上会问：“说出一个支付领域的垄断者。”结果是从来没有过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The competitiveness of this industry is just like any other competitiveness of any payment. Industry payments are notoriously a competitive world. There's actually never been a monopoly in payments. Full stop is a fun puzzle. I used to do cocktail parties like name a monopoly in payments. It turns out there has never been one.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我去参加鸡尾酒会时会谈论这些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I go to talking to all about cocktail parties. Yeah,</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 是的，你知道，我喜欢这个节目是有原因的，对吧？我听你们热情洋溢地评论各种深奥的事情。所以我想这会告诉你们关于这个领域竞争力的所有信息。但我们从一开始就决定，我们希望与所有相关方，包括我们的借款人，保持透明和诚实。这就是为什么我们提前告知所有信息。这就是为什么我们告诉他们：“这是你们关于利率和还款计划的详细披露。”对于我们的商家，我们告诉他们：“这是你们必须支付给我们的价格，如果你们选择支付的话。如果你们不能或不想，那没关系。我们可能不适合你们。”我们不会在其他地方弥补损失。我们不会在消费者最不期望的时候从他们身上榨取。那不是我们的品牌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I, you know, there's a reason I'm a fan of the show, right? I listen to, to, to you opine and all sorts of esoteric things with, with great gusto. And so I think that's we'll tell you everything you want to know about the competitiveness of the, of the space. But we have decided from the very beginning that we want transparency and honesty with everyone involved, with our borrowers. That's why we say everything upfront. That's why we tell them, here's your disclosure on exactly the rates and the schedules with our merchants. We tell them, here is the price you will have to pay us if that's where you're paying. If you can't, don't want to, that's fine. We will probably not be the right one for you. We won't make it up elsewhere. We're not going to take it out of the consumers hide when they least expect it. That's just not the brand.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 市面上肯定有更便宜的供应商。有很多品牌会说“我们就像Affirm，但对商家来说便宜得多”。这实际上意味着“我们收取各种隐藏费用。我们有各种其他方式从消费者身上榨取钱财。”这实际上意味着，凭借15年的经验，消费者在浏览按钮列表时会说：“嗯，我想使用的那个是不会在我遇到困难时让我受损的。”这使得过去12个月内有2400万活跃用户。我们觉得我们信守了诺言，消费者也一直在回来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There are definitely cheaper providers out there. There are plenty of brands that will say we're just like a firm, but way less expensive for merchants. What that really means is that's because we charge all sorts of hidden fees. We have all sorts of other ways of taking it out of consumers skin. What this means practically, with 15 years of experience is consumers as they cast their eye over the list of buttons, they say, well, the one I want to use is the one that's not going to get me. If I stumble. And that makes for 24 million active users in the last 12 months. And we feel like we've we've kept our promise and the consumers keep coming back.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 只是再次重申Joe关于商家方面的问题，我想他们会收到来自许多不同分期贷款机构、BNPL公司的报价，而且我认为他们不太关心承保。那不是他们的问题，那是您的问题，对吧？所以我猜他们最关心的是费用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just reiterating Joe's question, though, on the merchant side again, I imagine they're getting offers from a bunch of different, installment lenders, Bnpl companies, and I don't think they do. They care much about the underwriting. It's not really their problem. It's your problem. Right. So I assume the thing they care most about is the fee,</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 他们实际上关心三件事。好的。所以他们绝对关心费用。如果没有费用，这部分费用可以低至低于信用卡。所以今天典型的信用卡利率大约在2.5%到3%之间，取决于商家的规模。但那是行业平均水平。我们绝对会在最低限度上达到这些数字，最高可达低个位数百分点，当你补贴消费者利息时。所以我们不是一个比信用卡更便宜的供应商。那不是，你知道，他们希望任何人有那种错觉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">which seems like they actually care about three things. Okay. So they absolutely care about the fee like that. Without it, which which can range from as low as less than credit card. So a typical credit card rate today is on the order of between two and a half and 3%, depending on the size of the merchant. But that's kind of the average in the industry. We will definitely meet you around those numbers at the absolute lowest, and goes up all the way to, let's say, low single digit percentage points when you are subsidizing consumer interest. So we are not a cheaper than credit cards provider like that. That's not you know, they want anybody to have that illusion.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 他们关心的是费率，而不是利率。他们关心的是增量销售。所以如果你的下一个边际买家要么说“不，谢谢”，要么会让你花费5%，如果你有超过5%的利润空间，你就不希望商品留在货架上。你会愿意支付这5%来让边际买家说“是”。所以因为这个激励，我认为这很容易理解，你确实有很多商家会说：“好吧，那么我真正关心的是批准率。”这是我们关心的第二个变量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They care about the rate more than the rates. They care about incremental sales. So if your next marginal buyer is either a no thanks or it will cost you 5%, if you have the margin of better than 5%, you don't want the item staying on your shelves. You would like to pay this 5% to get the marginal buyer to say yes and so because of that incentive, which I think is easy to follow, you do have lots and lots of merchants that say, all right, so what I really care about then is the approval rates, which is the second variable we care about.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 所以当人们过来并说“嘿，我不会使用信用卡，除非我有分期贷款，比如来自Affirm，否则我没兴趣购买”时。他们需要知道这个批准率会足够高。否则，为什么会有一个按钮只是放在那里好看呢？所以我们的批准率通常高于行业其他公司，因为我们对承保非常执着，因为我们没有任何拐杖，例如滞纳金。所以这个承保的事情，我们真的不试图向商家解释。我们说什么？我们说：“看看我们的批准率。如果你看到他们的批准率明显高于行业水平，你就知道你会从中获得价值。”这就是为什么值得支付比信用卡更高的费用。所以这是真的。他们也确实这么做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So as people come through and say, hey, I'm not going to use a credit card, not interested in buying unless I have an installment loan, let's say from a firm. They need to know that that rate is going to be high enough. Otherwise why have a button that just sits there and looks pretty? And so our rates are typically higher than the rest of the industry because we are so obsessed with underwriting, because we have no crutches e.g. late fees. And so this underwriting thing, I don't we don't really try to explain it to merchants at all. What do we do? Say, look at our approval rates. If you see their approvals reach a meaningfully higher than the industry, you know you're going to get value from this. That's why it's worth paying more than credit cards. And so that is true. And that's that's what they do.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 他们关心的第三点是，每个商家都知道，第二次交易。他们希望第一次交易的成本可能超过其中的利润。他们支付给Google，他们支付给Facebook。他们很快就会支付给**大型语言模型**（Large Language Model, 简称**LLM**: 一种基于深度学习的AI模型，能够理解和生成人类语言）提供商或聊天机器人提供商，以推动第一次交易。他们想向你销售另一种商品。所以他们非常关心，如果他们使用BNPL供应商完成了第一次交易，它最好不要损害他们的品牌，因为如果BNPL供应商骚扰消费者还款，或者有滞纳金，或者有意外费用。这会给商家的品牌带来负面影响。所以他们确实关心滞纳金，但这与财务后果关系较小，更多地与人们是否会回来再次使用我们的服务有关。或者他们会说：“哦，我讨厌那个商家。我遇到了一些糟糕的交易。”所以他们通过自己的视角关心所有这些事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The third piece they do care about every merchant knows that. The second transaction is they want they want the first transaction cost them probably more than the margin in it. They're paying Google, they're paying Facebook. They'll soon be paying an Elm provider or Chatterbot provider to drive that first transaction in. They want to sell you another thing. So they very much care about if they had sold that first transaction using a buy now, pay later provider, it better not harm their brand because if they buy now, pay later provider is harassing the consumer for paying them back, or has late fees or has unexpected fees. It's going to accrete negatively to the merchants brand. And so they actually do care about lead fees in a way that has less to do with financial consequences, be more with will people come back to us and use our firm again? Or will they be like, oh, I hated that merchant. I got into some bad transaction. So they care about all these things through their own lens.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 这很有道理。那么，假设我开始接受您的前提。好的，这本身就比信用卡更好。人们不能完全放弃信用卡的一个原因是，并非所有地方都接受BNPL。人们希望钱包里有东西，对吧？他们希望在餐馆和任何他们知道会被接受的地方有东西。现在，如果您正在推出一张卡，或者您已经有了一张卡，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That makes a lot of sense. So let's say I start accepting your premise. Okay? This is per se better than, credit card. One reason that people can't just sort of quit credit cards generally is not every place takes buy now, pay later. People want something in their wallet, right? They want something at the restaurant. And wherever it is that they know it's going to be accepted. Now, if you are launching a card or you have a card, right,</p>

**Max Levchin:** 我们有卡。

**Joe Weisenthal:** 好的，已经有几年了。所以您有卡。但我很好奇，您提到了我们最近与Andreessen Horowitz的合伙人Scott Kupor的节目。他谈到信用卡的一点是，它们的广告成本非常高。信用卡公司的营销支出非常高。您提到您不怎么做广告。但我好奇的是，具体到卡片部分，如果您想成为消费者“钱包首选”（top of wallet）——我第一次听到这个词，抱歉——

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">okay around for a couple years. So you have a card. But I'm curious, you know, you you mentioned you referenced that recent episode that we did with our Drexler. And one of the things that he said about cards is they're very costly to advertise. The marketing expenditure for the card companies is very high. You mentioned that you don't do a lot of advertising. I'm curious, though, on the card component specifically, is that going to be, you know, if you want to be, quote, top of wallet to consumers? The first thing I think I've heard that phrase, I sorry.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 没错。我笑是因为我真的在努力用行业术语来表达，你真是个圈内人。如果你这样做，那就是你。所以如果你想成为消费者钱包的首选，并且在卡片方面，您能用一种轻广告模式做到这一点吗？还是真的需要投入大量资金才能获得显著的市场份额？

<details>

<p class="english-text">That's right. I'm laughing because I'm really I'm trying to claim myself with the industry lingo, your true insider, that if you do that, that's, you. So if you want to be top of wallet for the consumer and in the card, can you do that with an advertising lite model, or do you really need to spend to get significant wallet?</p>
</details>

### Affirm Card：无广告推广下的用户忠诚度与创新

**Max Levchin:** 当然可以。这张卡对我们的用户开放。所以这不是你在时代广场广告牌上会看到的东西。这是你一旦成为借款人，一旦你的信用状况良好，就会从Affirm那里了解到的东西。你就有资格获得**Affirm Card**（Affirm推出的双模式支付卡），就像是说：“嘿，你真的很喜欢我们，不是吗？这太棒了。你每年交易五次。如果你想在零售购物、餐馆或其他场合带我们一起，我们有办法。”它被称为Affirm Card。它实际上非常神奇。这张卡是一张双模式卡。当你告诉它时，它会明确地从借记模式切换到信用模式。所以当你买墨西哥卷饼时，我们期望你使用借记模式，它只是从你的账户中取钱，就是这样。显然没有利息，它只是一笔即时支付交易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure you can. The card is available to our users. So this is not a thing that you'll see on times Square displays. This is a thing you find out from affirm once you are a borrower. Once you're actually in good standing, you qualify for the affirm card as the hey, you really liked us, didn't you? This was great. You're transacting five times a year. If you want to take us with you to your retail, shopping experiences, restaurant or otherwise, we have a way. It's called the affirm card. It's actually pretty magical. The card is a dual mode card. It switches from debit to credit explicitly as you tell it to. And so when you're buying a burrito, we expect you to use the debit mode, which just literally takes the money from your account and that's it. There's no interest, obviously, it's just a paynow transaction.</p>

**Max Levchin:** 如果你买电视，你现在就可以在App里用Affirm购买，你说：“嘿，我的下一笔交易，我希望它是12个月的0%贷款”，因为零售商希望你免息购买。也许你会支付一些利息，但你是在App里设置这笔交易，然后当你下次点击时，你的卡就准备好了，它会自动变成一笔贷款。这是一种非常神奇的体验。它非常受欢迎。我们不需要做广告，因为我们从“我们有这个卡片想法”到大约12%的用户拥有它，速度非常快，因为它确实是一个非常好的产品。

<p class="english-text">If you're buying a TV, you can buy it now with affirm in the app, you say, hey, my next transaction. I want that to be a 12 months to 0% loan because the retailer wants you to have it interest free. Maybe you're paying some interest, but you're setting up that transaction in the app and then your card is ready when you tap it. Next time it becomes a loan automatically. It's a pretty magical experience. It's super popular. It's a it's a thing that we haven't needed to advertise because we went from, we have this card idea to about 12% of our users having one very, very quickly because it's just a really, really good product.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 再次强调，我们的用户，他们的心态早已从“循环欠款没关系，我不懂，但我不在乎”转变为“我不喜欢循环欠款。我不想支付滞纳金。我不想支付过高的利息。这个Affirm的东西很棒。”这张卡是合乎逻辑的下一步。它代表着“我能拥有多少这种类型的金融生活？”

<p class="english-text">Again, our user, their mindset has long been changed from revolving is okay, I don't understand it, but I don't care to. I don't like revolving. I don't want to pay late fees. I don't want to pay excessive interest. This affirm thing is neat. The card is a logical next step. It's how much more can I have of this type of financial life?</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 您对人们从其他BNPL贷款机构借款的情况了解多少？所以这种“堆叠”问题，现在已经被讨论过很多次了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How much insight do you have into, how much people are borrowing from other Bnpl lenders? So the sort of stacking issue, which has been discussed multiple times now, it's a great question.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 这是一个很好的问题。我们有相当不错的洞察力，因为我们非常了解用户群之间的重叠。所以这个答案有两个方面，值得深入探讨，因为这是我们与行业其他公司显著不同的地方。在我谈到“堆叠”部分之前，我将先谈谈重叠。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have a decent insight in the sense that we understand pretty well the overlap between user basis. So there's two prongs to his answer, and this one, it's worth delving into pretty deeply, because this is where we differ from the rest of the industry pretty significantly. So before I get into the stacking part, I'll address the, the overlap.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 我们通过外部调查做了很多研究。另外，当我们登录你的银行账户，或者我们要求供应商登录你的银行账户并提取你的一些交易数据时，我们就能瞥见你还在哪里花钱。所以我们对你可能还在哪里使用BNPL有相当不错的了解。到目前为止，我们与其他供应商的用户群重叠非常小，所以“堆叠”的可能性很小，仅仅因为使用Affirm的人倾向于继续使用Affirm。他们有时会转向使用其他供应商，但数量非常小，交易金额也明显较低。我认为我们的平均交易额明显高于行业其他公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we do a lot of studying just externally through surveys. Also because when we log into your bank account or we ask a provider to log into your bank account and pull in some of your transactional data, we get a glimpse into what else you're spending money on. So we have a decent sense for where else you might be using buy now, pay later. And to date, the user base overlap with other providers is quite minimal, so there's not a whole lot of stacking possibility simply because people who use affirm tend to state with affirm they sometimes straight and use other providers, but it's quite minimal for a meaningfully lower transactional amount. I think we average a significantly higher average transaction relative to the rest of the industry.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 到目前为止，这还没有成为问题。从长远来看，你当然可以争辩说：“当然，现在你们都还很小。你们增长得很快。每个人都在从信用卡行业分一杯羹。五年后，当每个人都注册了他们最喜欢的交易，现在又注册了第二个时，会发生什么？”解决这个问题的正确方法，而且这确实是正确的方法，尽管我有点传统主义，但我真的相信正确的方法是每个人都向信用局报告。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So far, that's not been a problem in the long term. You, of course, can make the argument like, sure, right now you guys are all still tiny. You're growing really quickly. Everybody's taken a bite out of the credit card industry. What happens five years from now when everyone has signed up for their favorite deal, and they're now signing up for a second one? The right way to address this problem, and this is the right way. And it's it's traditionalist of me, but I really do believe is the right way is for everyone to report to the credit bureaus.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 今天，当我们访问三大信用局之一时，我们能看到你从其他传统信贷来源借款的情况，以及你借款的相对当前状态。这也是我们自己承保时使用的一个变量。Affirm是目前唯一一家**提供数据**（Furnishes: 向信用机构报告借贷数据，包括正面和负面信息）的公司。这是另一个行业术语，它将按时还款和未按时还款的正面和负面数据提供给信用局。我们的大多数竞争对手，一般来说，不这样做。尽管每个人都从一开始就进行了一些尝试，但我们认为为按时还款的人建立信用历史和提高信用评分，是为我们的借款人提供的一个关键价值主张。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Today, when we tap into one of the three major credit bureaus, we see what you're borrowing and relatively current state of your borrowing from other traditional sources of credit. And it is a variable that we use inside of our own underwriting. A firm today is the only one that furnishes. That's another fancy industry term, delivers the data of both positive and negative as you're on time, you're not on time to the credit bureaus. The rest of our competitive set, generally speaking, does not. Although everyone has experimented a little bit from the very beginning, we saw the idea of building credit history and improving credit scores for people who are on time as a key value proposition for our borrower,</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 比如，我们不会是消费者唯一的贷款人，他们每个人都可能需要一张卡，有一天他们需要借钱买房。这意味着他们与我们所做的一切，特别是如果他们做得很好，我们97%的消费者都做得非常好，他们总是按时还款。这必须以某种方式反映在他们的永久记录中。所以我们基本上从一开始就一直在提供数据。说服信用局以及提供传统信用评分的公司理解我们提供的数据并以正确的方式处理它，以便当你按时还款时，分数上升，当你未按时还款时，分数下降等等，这花费了很长时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">like we are not going to be the only lender for our consumers that each bar for a card they need to borrow for a house one day. That means whatever they're doing with us, especially if they're doing well, which 97% of our consumers are doing really, really well. They're on time all the time. It has to reflect in their permanent record somehow. So we've been furnishing basically from the very beginning. It took a long time to persuade not just the credit bureaus, but also the companies that provide traditional credit scores to understand the data we furnish and treat it in the right way, so that when you are on time, the scores go up, when you're not on time, the scores go down, etc..</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 所以我们基本上在过去十年里都是自愿做这些工作的。今天，行业现状是，如果你是一个BNPL供应商，并且你不提供数据，你简直没有借口。我们开创了这项工作，我们做了所有的事情，我们与评分机构和信用局合作，我们现在正在发送所有数据。所以我们希望每个人都加入我们。因为大多数人确实按时还款，他们的信用历史应该反映他们的良好还款情况，但那些不应该借款的人也应该被反映出来。我认为这真的非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so we did all that work basically on a volunteer basis over the last decade. And today, right now, the state of the industry is if you are a Bnpl provider and you're not furnishing data, you kind of have no excuse. Like, we pioneered this, we did all the work, we worked with the score builders and the credit bureaus, and we're now sending all of our data. And so we want everyone to join us. Because most people do pay on time, their credit histories should reflect their good repayment, but also people who should not be borrowing should be reflected. And I think that's just really, really important.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 如果我能在你们节目上做一点广告，那不是为Affirm，而是为你们所有人。如果你在BNPL行业，请提供你们的数据。这会帮助消费者，最终也会提升你们的品牌。但目前，我们是唯一一家主要的提供者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If I can, if I can do one bit of advertising on your show, it won't be for a firm. It will be all of you out there. If you are in a buy now, pay later industry, furnish your damn data. It will help consumers and it will eventually agreed to your brand too. But for now, we are the only major one.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 那么阻力是什么呢？因为这似乎很明显。如果每个人都关心承保，你会希望有更多的数据。那么为什么不提供呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wait, what's the resistance then? Because it seems kind of obvious. If everyone cares about the underwriting, you would want more data out there. So why not provide it?</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 我不想假装我理解所有的动机，但我认为一个基本的推断性想法可能会出现：如果你从滞纳金中赚了很多钱，那么告诉你的消费者“别担心，你可以还清我，它不会记录在你的永久记录中”是一件很酷的事情。而如果你从滞纳金中赚不到钱，你就没有动力告诉你的消费者“哦，没关系，付给我一些钱，我们不会告发你”。滞纳金与缺乏报告之间的联系，不幸的是，其根本事实是，因为我们不从滞纳金中赚钱，因为我们不收取任何费用，所以我们非常支持报告。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I don't want to pretend that I understand all the motivations, but I think a basic inferential thought might occur that if you're making a lot of money from late fees, it's a cool thing to tell your consumers, don't worry, you can just pay me off and it won't go on your permanent record. And if you don't make any money from late fees, you have no incentive to tell your consumers, oh, it's okay, just pay me some sum and, we won't tell on you. The connection between late fees and lack of reporting is unfortunately, the, the underlying fact that because we don't make any money from late fees, because we don't charge any, we're very pro reporting just out of curiosity.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 只是出于好奇。所以如果你谈论滞纳金和信用等等，我们正在2025年12月2日录制这个节目。您能为我们评估一下消费者的情绪吗？您是否看到任何逾期付款增加的迹象？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if you're talking about late fees and credit and all that stuff here we are recording this on December 2nd, 2025. You have any, you take the temperature of the consumer for us. I don't think you're doing seeing any signs of growing missed payments or anything like that.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 截至2025年12月2日，没有。理解这一点很重要，我经常被问到这个问题。Affirm是了解北美消费者财务状况和思维的一个绝佳窗口。我们在美国、加拿大和现在的英国运营。这是一个特定的人群。这些人更具财务责任感。他们做出了有意识的选择。他们选择我们不仅仅因为是分期付款，而且很方便。还因为我们告诉他们我们不收取滞纳金。还因为我们告诉他们0%旁边没有星号。我们没有任何星号。我们的核心价值观之一是“没有细则”。我们言出必行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Not as of December 2nd, 2025. The important thing to understand I I'm asked this question fairly often. I am a great I am a firm is a great lens into the financial hearts and minds of North American consumer. Operate in the US, Canada and now UK. It is a specific set of people. These people are more financially responsible. They made a conscious choice. They picked us not just because it's installment pay. And yeah, it's convenient. It's also because we told them we don't charge late fees. It's also because we told them he'd be asterisk next to the 0%. We don't have any asterisks. And one of our core values is no fine print. And we mean it. And on and on and on.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 所以，Affirm的消费者很可能在任何宏观经济“地震”到来时，都会更晚受到影响。但就目前而言，我们对我们的账簿和美国消费者都感觉相当良好。

<p class="english-text">And so it stands to reason that affirm consumers will be probably much later into any kind of a macro economic earthquake territory. If there was one to come. But as of right now, we're we feel quite good about our book and also about the U.S. consumer.</p>

### 应对成本变化与AI在Affirm的应用

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我要问您一个问题，我会提到一个竞争对手。我不会让您说出竞争对手的名字，但我会先提出我的问题，然后再问您。您的一家竞争对手Klarna最近宣布推出一种与美元挂钩的**稳定币**（Stablecoin: 一种加密货币，其价值与美元等稳定资产挂钩）。我非常愤世嫉俗。所以当我看到像随机公司宣布一些加密货币相关的东西时，有时它有道理，但通常会觉得：“这可能只是一个好的新闻稿吗？”我还没有真正研究过Klarna的那个。但是对于您，Affirm，现在，当您作为一个在互联网支付领域摸爬滚打了几十年的人，您认为稳定币或任何加密货币现在能为您解锁什么吗？当您思考未来和那些传统渠道无法实现的机会时？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm going to ask you a question and, I'm going to mention a competitor. I won't make you name the competitor, but I'll just say it my question and then I'll ask you about. So one of your competitors, Klarna, recently announced a new dollar pegged stablecoin. And I'm very cynical. And so when I see, like, random companies announcing some crypto thing, like sometimes it makes sense, but, but often it's like, well, maybe is this just a good press release or something like that? And I haven't really looked at the Klarna one. The but for you affirm right now, when you look at and you as someone who has been in the internet payment trenches for literally decades right now, does do stablecoins or anything crypto unlock anything for you right now? When you think about the future and you think about opportunities that you can't do with traditional rails,</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 简短的回答是，我认为不能。我也非常愤世嫉俗，所以我想你很不幸地触及了我完全相同的思维流程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the short answer is I don't think so. Now, I'm also very cynical, so I think you're unfortunately tapping into the exact same mind flow that that you have.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 这是我们邀请他们上播客并让他们反驳我们的方式，但请继续，继续。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is our way of asking them to want to come on the podcast and have argue against it, but keep going, keep going.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 我相信新闻稿中肯定有一些思考。所以我认为它不是纯粹的新闻稿。所以我会，我会尝试告诉我们，我不会让您猜测竞争对手，但请从不同的角度告诉我们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I, you know, I, I am confident that there is some thought that went to the press release. So I don't think it's a pure press release. So I will, I will I get I try to tell us about I won't make you. We're not going to make you speculate on a competitor, but just tell us about from different perspective.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 当然，我会用稻草人论证（strawman）的方式来解释原因。为什么不这样做是显而易见的，我想你可能比我做得更好。为什么这样做呢？有几个原因。第一，一般来说，如果你有很多跨境商务，外汇，以及从制裁到储备账户等各种尽职调查的复杂性，你可能会稍微眯着眼说：“你知道吗？如果我们在所有地方都使用与美元挂钩的稳定币，那会容易一点。”我认为这是真的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure I will strawman the reasons why. Yes. So why not is obvious. I think you probably can do a much better job than I can. The why? Yes. So there are a couple of reasons. One, in general, if you have a lot of cross-border commerce, foreign exchange, the complexity of just diligence around, you know, everything from sanctions to reserve accounts, etc., you can sort of squint a little and say, you know what? If we just lived in dollar pegged stablecoins everywhere all at once, it would be a little bit easier. And I think that's true.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 电子商务并不是一个非常显著的跨境领域。所以在你说“哦，如果我从桑给巴尔买很多东西，然后用Affirm支付，但他们以稳定币作为结算货币，那不是很好吗？”他们会很高兴，因为他们想要美元，而这东西本质上等同于美元。这是一个好故事。只是美国大多数人不会从桑给巴尔买很多东西。他们会在其他国家买一些东西，但大多数时候，因为我们都希望商品很快送到我们手中，我们很可能是从美国某个靠近美国的仓库的子公司购买的，所以这还不是一个很大的市场。但如果五年后你看到我发布新闻稿，那不是因为我终于意识到我错过了什么。那是因为我们的规模已经有足够的跨境商务，足以产生影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">E-commerce is not a very significantly cross-border discipline. And so before you sort of say, oh, wouldn't it be amazing if I bought lots of things from Zanzibar and just paid them with a firm, but they got stablecoin as a settlement currency, they'll be very happy because they want dollars in this thing is essentially dollar equivalent. It's a good story. Just most people in the US don't buy a lot of things from Zanzibar. They buy some things in other countries, but most of the time, because we all want things shipped to us very, very quickly, we're probably buying it from a US subsidiary that's warehouses somewhere pretty close to the US, and so it's not that big of a market just yet. But in like five years, if you see me putting out a press release, it's not because I finally realized that I'm missing out. It's because there's enough cross-border commerce in our scale where it starts to make a difference. That's the best I got in terms of why would you want to do this?</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 为什么不这样做的明显原因，就像是：“嗯，也许你想在人与人之间转移资金，但那不是我们的业务。”也许你相信有一天Joe的钱包里会装满稳定币。我真的很难想象你会支持一大堆不同品牌的、与美元挂钩的、实际上等同的稳定币，就像一本优惠券簿，我有我的Affirm稳定币和我的XYZ品牌稳定币，然后我要在这两者之间选择，这些都没有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The obvious of why nots. It's like, well, maybe you want to move money around person to person, but that's not our business. Maybe you want to believe that one day Joe will have a wallet full of stablecoins. I really have a hard time imagining you supporting a whole bunch of different kinds of brand. A dollar pegged, effectively equivalent stablecoins like a coupon book of I got my affirm stablecoin and my brand XYZ stablecoin, and I'm going to choose between the two like none of that.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 也许有些，比如说，奖励呢？你知道，这是信用卡目前拥有的一点，比如“哦，我获得了里程”。如果我使用稳定币，我能获得回扣吗？但我不知道。我只是随便说说。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Maybe some of the like. What about for like rewards? Like, you know, that's one thing that credit cards currently have that like, oh, I get miles. Like, could there be something with if I use the stablecoin, I get remitted, but I don't know. I'm just I'm just throwing stuff out.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 说实话，我花了很多时间思考“生态系统”这个词，主要是对此感到愤怒，因为它是一种记录不那么充分的财富转移。顺便说一句，信用卡行业总体上是一种累退的财富转移，那些从不循环交易的人，比如你们两位和我，当我们使用信用卡时（现在已经很少了），我们月底会付清账单，一分钱利息都不付。我想Joe曾公开表示你从未支付过任何利息。所以我想，如果你能负担得起，那是一个很好的状态。但告诉人们他们不应该借钱，而应该在月底还清，对于21世纪的支付领域来说，这相当于“何不食肉糜”的说法。美国有很多人会循环欠款。一半的美国人循环着1万美元的债务。所以，这些人会关心奖励的想法是荒谬的。他们不关心奖励，他们关心的是如何支付最低还款额。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So for what it's worth, I spend a lot of my time contemplating the word ecosystem and mostly raging against it because it is one of the less documented wealth transfers. And by the way, the credit card industry in general is a regressive wealth transfer where people who never evolve transactions, like probably both of you and me, when I use credit cards, which is really rare these days, we're paying our bills. At the end of the month, we're not paying a penny of interest. I think Joe on the record saying you've never paid any interest. And so I think that, that, that, that that's a nice place to be, if you can afford it, telling people that they should just not borrow and pay it off at the end of the month is an incredibly let them eat cake equivalent for the 21st century, payments. Lots of people in America revolve half the country involved in a $10,000, and so the idea of those people caring about rewards is sort of preposterous. They do not. They care about making their minimum payment.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 那些正在研究他们想要参与哪种奖励计划的人，我只是不太相信他们会扩展他们的视野去拥有更多的稳定币，因为最终他们得到的是美元。在Affirm的世界里，我们每天服务的2400万用户，他们真的非常关心他们支付的利率，因为他们很多人明白，另一种选择是循环欠款。所以对他们来说，被告知“嘿，你的奖励是0%贷款”是非常有力的。所以在我们把辛苦赚来的收入投入稳定币之前，我们会以无息的形式把它还给消费者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">People who are figuring out which reward scheme they want to be a part of. I, I'm just not so convinced that they're going to be expanding their horizons to have more stable coins, because ultimately they're they're getting dollars in the world of a firm people that are people that we serve every single day, 24 million of them in the last 12 months. They really, really care about the interest rates they pay, because a lot of them understand that the alternative is revolving. And so for them being told, hey, your reward is a 0% loan is incredibly powerful. And so before we get into using our hard earned revenue into stablecoins, we will just give it back to the consumers in the form of no, no interest.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我们谈了您如何赚钱，但我们也应该谈谈您的成本方面。您之前提到了资金。所以您必须从某个地方获得资金，并且您为此支付费用。如果资金成本上升，您有什么杠杆可以利用？我再次意识到我们是在12月初录制这个节目，每个人都预计利率会很快下调。但理论上，如果利率上升，您能做些什么来抵消额外的成本？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we talked about how you make money, but we should talk a little bit about your cost side as well. And you mentioned funding earlier. So you have to get money from somewhere and you're paying for that money. What levers do you have to pull if the cost of money goes up? And again, I'm aware that we're recording this in early December and everyone expects an imminent rate cut. But in theory, if interest rates were to go up, what could you do to offset that additional cost?</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 关于我们业务中资本来源部分最重要的一点是，每个人都明白利率不是超级波动的。但是，如果你回顾几年前，它们在短暂而不那么光辉的时刻确实非常波动。所以我们都知道这是可能的。因此，我们与各种贷款人以及购买我们贷款的人签订的所有合同，都会在相当长的一段时间内相当温和地调整。所以问题不是我们能否应对信贷成本的上升，而是它们对我们来说变化有多快？当然，我们明白它们可能会迅速变化。因此，我们的大多数合同都规定，如果它们确实上升，我们成本的调整将在一段时间内相当缓慢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the most important thing to understand about our business, from the capital sourcing part of the game, everyone understands that rates are not super volatile. But, you know, if you look back a couple years, they were very volatile. If for for a brief, not so shining moment. And so we all knew it was possible. So all of our contracts with various lenders of money to us, but also people who will buy our loans, the all adjust fairly gently over a course of a fairly long period of time. So it's not about can we deal with rising costs of credit for us, it's how quickly do they change for us? And of course, we understand that they might change quickly. Therefore, a lot of our contracts stipulate that, hey, if they do move up, the adjustments to our cost will go fairly slowly over a period of time.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 因此，12月更可能的结果是当前利率的下行。或者它们保持稳定，但就像我描述的那样，我们不会在一觉醒来就获得全部25或3个基点的增量收入。它最终会以累积利润的形式来到我们这里，但这需要时间，因为这些合同的调整，无论是上升还是下降，都相当缓慢。我们在行业中绝非独一无二。每个人都这样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the more likely outcome in December is probably a downward motion of the current rates. Or perhaps they stay steady, but just the same as I described, we're not going to wake up to all 25 three basis points of incremental revenue. It will eventually come to us in a form of accrual margin, but it'll take its time because these contracts adjust both up and down quite slowly. And we're in no way unique in the industry. Everybody does that.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 我们应对这种成本变化的杠杆正是你所期望的。所以我们要么将其转嫁给消费者，以25个基点的增量上升或下降并不那么显著。大多数人，我认为，通常不太关心。在某些情况下，我们实际上选择告诉商家X：“您免费提供这些利率。您应该继续这样做，但您的成本会稍微增加一点，因为现在利率变化了。”因为货币时间价值，商家实际上是在交易完成时实时支付我们的费用，所以他们的真实成本确实是微不足道的。因此，在这两种情况下，只要波动不是非常剧烈，它就不是我们业务的一个主要组成部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The levers we have to deal with such cost changes are exactly what you would expect. So we will either pass it through to the consumers and moving up in the increments or down of 25 basis points is not that significant. Then most people, I think, generally don't care that much. In some cases, we actually choose to tell, hey merchant X, you are providing these rates for nothing. You should continue doing so, but the cost to you will go up a tiny bit because the rate of change now, because of time value of money, the merchants pay us in real time, essentially as a transaction is consummated, the true cost to them is truly de minimis. And so in either of these two cases, so long as the movements are not very violent, it's not that major a component of our business.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 我只剩最后一个问题。撇开承保技术不谈，我确信它是一个非常高科技、数据密集型的应用程序，也撇开您的大多数工程师可能正在使用代码生成技术。就您的技术主管身份而言，作为一个监督大型组织的人，人们正在寻找大型语言模型（LLM）如何在Affirm的生产能力中得到部署。今天，这些技术是否正在生产中使用，并在某些方面节省了人力工时？

<p class="english-text">I just have one last question. I so setting aside the technology for the underwriting, which I'm sure is very high tech, data intensive application and setting aside that, probably many of your engineers on staff are using code generating for that. Just putting your tech hat on. As someone who oversees a large organization, people looking for how large language models in particular are being deployed in productive capacity at a firm today, is any of this technology in use in production and saving human hours in some respect or another?</p>

**Max Levchin:** 是的。非常肯定。我们刚刚结束了“网络周末”——“火鸡五日”、“黑色星期五”、“网络星期一”等等，随便你怎么称呼。我还没有具体数据，因为我会在播客录制结束后立即收到报告，但我一直在……嗯，我可能无法提前公布我们明年年初报告的结果，但我们已经处理了数万次消费者联系。人们提出的问题从“嘿，我刚从你这里借了钱，我不明白我的第一笔付款何时到期”，你知道，也许是因为他们没有清楚地阅读电子邮件，到“我刚借了钱，我意识到我需要退款，因为我根本不打算买这个东西”等等。

I don't actually have the stat yet because I will get the report immediately after this podcast is recorded, but I'm constantly, well, I probably can't, pronounce the results we report early next year, but we will have handled tens of thousands of consumer contacts, people saying everything from, hey, I just borrowed money from you and I don't understand when my first payment is due. And, you know, maybe it's because they hadn't read the emails clearly or everything all the way down to I just borrowed money and I realized that I need a refund because I actually have no intention of buying this thing and all this stuff, and a lot of it.</p>

**Max Levchin:** 我们尝试在他们交易时实时为他们提供服务，但很多人在购买后立即或有时在购买后联系我们。其中很大一部分完全由AI处理。现在，这并没有导致我们解雇我们优秀的客户服务人员。它让我们能够深入专业化。AI在处理基本问题方面非常非常出色。它可以做一些很酷的事情，比如查询你的账户并说：“不，你没有逾期，你弄错了。别担心。”或者“是的，你逾期了，但我们不收取滞纳金。所以请尽快还清，我们就会继续。”所有这些都可以由AI出色地处理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We try to serve them in real time as they're transacting, but plenty of people contact us right after or maybe sometime, you know, after the purchase. A huge percentage of that is handled entirely by AI. Now, now, that has not caused us to lay off our wonderful customer service staff at all. What it has allowed us to do is to go really deep into specialization. AI is very, very good today at handling basic questions. It can do cool things like look up your account and say, no, you're not late, you're mistaken. Don't worry about it. Or yes, you're late, but we don't charge late fees. So just please make yourself current and we'll move on. All of that can be handled by AI wonderfully.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 如果是像“我改了名字”或者“我在完成这笔交易时搬家了”这样的事情，会有各种各样奇怪的事情发生，这些事情需要人工处理。AI模型目前还不够智能，无法处理其中一些事情，而且通常，我们不希望**幻觉**（Hallucination: AI生成不准确或虚假信息）的可能性破坏良好的客户关系。所以我们已经能够将我们的人工助手转移到更复杂、更专业的角色中。所以我们去年客户服务的主题是专业化、专业化、专业化，我们现在培训人们去解决非常非常具体的问题子集，因为这样他们可以更有效率，行动更快。所以这些工具实际上让他们更有效率，让他们专注于他们擅长的非常具体的事情。

<p class="english-text">If it's something like I changed my name or, you know, I changed where I live, right as I was consummating this transaction, there's all sorts of crazy things that come up out of that is something that a human can handle. AI models are not smart enough yet to handle some of these things, and also frequently, if we wouldn't want the possibility of hallucination to derail what is a good customer relationship. So we've been able to move our human helpers into a much more sophisticated, much more specific role. So the theme in our customer service for last year has been specialization, specialization, specialization where we train people now to serve very, very specific subset of problems because they can be effective and move faster. And so these tools are actually making them more efficient by letting them focus on just a very specific thing that they're good at.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 这就是一个例子。我们跟踪内部AI工具使用的各种有趣指标。有趣或有点随机的事实是，我们的工程部门并不是AI工具最大的消费者。我不会透露具体是谁。顺便说一句，绝大多数，或者说不能透露是谁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that's one example. We track all sorts of interesting metrics about AI tool usage internally. The interesting or sort of random factoid, our engineering group is not the single largest consumer of AI tools. I will not reveal exactly who it is. And by the way, the vast majority or cannot reveal who it is.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 给我们一点提示。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Give us a hint or something.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 实际上是财务部门。我们的财务部门痴迷地使用这些工具。我在这里有点作弊。很长一段时间以来，现在已经不是这样了，但很长一段时间以来，因为我们是一家重度依赖AI和机器学习的公司。对任何员工，尤其是财务部门的员工，核心要求之一是，你必须知道如何阅读代码，并且可能还要编写代码。所以我们财务部门所做的大部分工作实际上看起来很像编码和大量的软件工程。但也许是因为他们平均而言是一个较小的团队。但他们是这些工具的优秀采用者。我们的法务团队一直都在使用它。我们有几十万份非常定制化的合同。每次商家为你支付利息时，他们都签订了合同。那是一份定制合同。想象一下管理五十万份这样的东西。它们都经过精心编写和措辞，所以我可以阅读并发现错误和更正等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's actually finance. Our, finite finance group uses these tools obsessively. I'm cheating a little bit here. So for a very long time it's not the case anymore, but for a very long time, because we are so AI and ML heavy company. One of the core requirements for any employee, but certainly in finance, was you have to know how to read code and probably write code. And so huge percentage of what we do in our finance group actually looks a lot like coding and a lot of software engineering. And so but there's some how maybe because the smaller group on average. But, they're great adopters of these tools. Our legal team uses it all the time. We have literally hundreds of thousands of very custom contracts. Every time a merchant pays your interest for you, they signed up for it. Contractually, that's a custom contract. Imagine managing half a million of these things. They're all carefully written and spoken, so I can read and find errors and corrections, etcetera, etcetera.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 我们使用。作为一家受监管的企业，我们的一项职责是，我们不能允许商家不正确地宣传我们的服务。当商家说“万岁！Affirm对每个人都免息”之类的话时，我们实际上要承担责任。这不是真的。有些人有时确实会支付一些利息。所以我们必须。我们有责任发现这一点，并告诉商家：“请停止说不完全真实的话。”AI工具在阅读大量广告文案并指出“嘿，这个词不准确”方面非常出色。我们必须立即发送电子邮件，告诉商家纠正它。所以你可以想象，当ChatGPT出现时，我们涌现了大量的想法，并在过去几年中将其付诸实践。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We use. So one of the things we're responsible for as a regulated business is we cannot allow merchants to advertise our service incorrectly. We're actually on the hook when a merchant says something like hooray! Affirm interest free for everyone. It's not true. Some people will actually pay some interest sometimes. And so we have to. We are responsible for finding that and telling the merchant, please stop saying things that aren't. Strictly speaking, true. AI tools are amazing at reading boatloads of advertising copy and saying hey, this second, that is inaccurate. We got a fire off an email and tell this merchant to fix it so you can sort of imagine a flood of ideas that we had with the ChatGPT moment happen, and put it to work for the last few years.</p>

### 理想支付系统的愿景与Affirm的未来

**Joe Weisenthal:** 我将以一个理论问题，一个宏观理论问题来结束。如果您可以从零开始设计一个理想的支付系统，完全从零开始，使用今天的技术，没有传统的卡网络，甚至可能没有传统银行。它会是什么样子？Affirm当前的商业模式有多少会在那种环境中幸存下来？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm going to end with, a sort of theoretical question, big picture theoretical question. But if you could design the ideal payment system from scratch, complete scratch, you know, using today's technology, there's no legacy card networks, maybe not even legacy banks. What would it look like, and how much of a firm's current business model would sort of survive in that environment?</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 嗯，我想它会非常像Affirm。Affirm是我个人尝试建立一个我能引以为傲的系统。我们告诉加入我们的人的核心理念之一，也是我们如此黑白分明，没有滞纳金，没有复利，没有递延利息，没有任何不愉快的原因，是因为我希望那些本可以去华尔街在量化基金交易的最聪明的人加入我们，建立一个他们可以引以为傲的系统。很难为一个一半收入来自滞纳金的东西感到骄傲，这就是我们不这样做的原因。所以我们建立的东西，尽管我有偏见，但它确实非常棒。它确实是我非常引以为傲的东西。我认为整个团队都为我们建立这个系统的方式感到非常自豪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think you would look an awful lot like a firm. A firm is my personal attempt to build a system that I can be proud about. One of the core things we tell people who join us, one of the reasons we had this such a black and white, no late fees, no compounding, no deferred interest. None of the yuck is because I wanted the smartest people that would have otherwise gone to Wall Street and traded in quant funds to join us and build the system that they could be proud about. It's very hard to be proud about a thing that makes half its money and late fees, and that's why we don't do it. And so what we've built is biased as I am. It's pretty darn great. It really is something that I'm very proud about. And I think the totality of the team here takes an enormous amount of pride in how we went about building this.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 它依赖于并与传统系统交织在一起。但即使我们通过**护栏**（Guardrails: 在行业中指为确保系统或流程安全、合规和稳定运行而设置的限制或指导原则），使用另一个行业术语，或者许多其他已经存在的系统，当我们进入资本市场时，这些市场在我们出现之前就已经存在了很久，以及介于两者之间的一切，我们始终保持产品及其DNA的道德完整性。如果我们借钱放贷，我们可能会支付滞纳金。我们没有，因为显然我们在这里管理得非常严格。它不会转嫁给消费者。我们对系统内部的尽职调查感到无比自豪，甚至不惜为我们的合作伙伴留下一点点利润，因为我们拒绝赚取比我们承诺的更多的钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is dependent, intertwined with the legacy systems. But even as we go through guardrails to use another industry jargon or many other systems that have existed, when we tap into capital markets, which are certainly been here long before we came about, and everything else in between, we maintain the moral integrity of the product and its DNA all the way through. We might pay late fees if we borrow money to lend. We haven't, because obviously we're on a pretty tight ship here. It will not be pass through. We take an incredible amount of pride in the diligence we exercise within the system, all the way down to leaving a penny on the table for our partners to keep because we refuse to make more money than we said we would.</p>
</details>

**Max Levchin:** 所以我很乐意进行一次关于支付的白纸设计练习。但我认为最终会出现一个非常像Affirm的系统，只是没有一些1980年代的粗糙之处。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I would love to have a blank sheet design exercise in payments. But I think what would emerge is a system that looks a lot like a firm, just doesn't have some of the 1980s craft in it.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** Max Levchin，Affirm的创始人兼CEO。很高兴与您交谈。这是一次非常有启发性、有帮助的对话，感谢您来到我们的节目。Tracy，我觉得这很棒。我觉得这真的很有趣，有助于理解BNPL公司与信用卡公司在赚钱方式和不同之处方面的真正细节。对我来说，这是一次非常有帮助的对话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Max Levchin, founder and CEO of a firm. So great chatting with you. Very illuminating, helpful conversation, and I appreciate you coming on our lot. Tricia I thought that was great. I thought that was really interesting and just sort of understanding the real nuts and bolts about how the money is made and what's different about the Bnpl companies from the credit card companies, to my mind, very helpful conversation.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 是的，我觉得关于其他BNPL公司为什么不想向信用局报告等等的讨论真的很有趣。你知道，我想知道这是否会很快改变。也许随着这个领域的扩张，政治家们和监管机构会开始对此感兴趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I thought it was really interesting, the discussion about why other Bnpl companies don't want to report. Yeah, the credit bureaus and things like that. You know, I wonder if that'll change, anytime soon. Maybe politicians will start getting interested in it. Regulators as the space expands.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 听Max讲话时我有一个想法，他提到了积分系统的累退性。对吧。所以像我们这样很少循环使用信用卡，但能获得常旅客里程或其他奖励的人。但这笔费用是由那些循环欠款的人支付的，对吧？或者抱歉，是由那些循环欠款的人支付的。现在，如果Affirm的目标是那些不考虑积分的人。对吧。他们考虑的是那些真正需要延长付款期限或隐性循环欠款的人，并说我们有更好的选择。所以这有点像是在分割。你知道，如果Affirm这家市值只有220亿美元的公司继续增长，你就会想，如果在一个最大化的版本中，你已经分割了大量循环欠款的人，那么像我们这样的人的积分生态系统会发生什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A thought that I had listening to Max was, he mentioned the sort of the regressive ness of the point system. Right. So there's people like us who rarely roll their credit card, but get frequent flier miles or other rewards, etc. but that's paid for by the people that roll, right? Or sorry, that's paid for by the people who roll. Now, if affirm is targeting, they're not they're clearly targeting people who are not thinking about points. Right. They're thinking about people who really do need to extend their payments or implicitly roll and say, we have a better option. So it's sort of cleaving off if, you know, if this grows, the firm is still just a $22 billion company, by market cap. Whatever this grows, you gotta wonder, like if in the maximal version where you've cleaved off a significant number of people who roll, what happens to the point ecosystem for the people like us?</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 当然，我不会想“哦，可怜的常旅客和你们获得的丰厚奖励怎么办”，但总有人会想到积分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, granted, I don't think like, oh, what about the poor freaking flier and all the great rewards you're getting, but you just someone think the point?</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 嗯，请有人想想那些从不负债或从不循环债务的积分累积者。但思考一下，如果你能分割出那一部分，那么信用卡，传统信用卡公司商业模式的很大一部分可能会变得不稳定，如果循环欠款者转向这种替代支付模式，那么提供大量奖励的任何信用卡的吸引力可能会下降，这确实很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, someone please think about the points accumulators who never go into debt or who never, like, roll their debt. But it is interesting to think about, if you could, like, cleave off that, then a big part of the business model of credit card, the legacy card companies could potentially be unstable and part of the appeal of going to any credit card that offers a lot of rewards could decline if revolvers moved to this alternate payment model. Yeah, it's a really good point. Yeah, it's a really good point on points.</p>
</details>

**Joe Weisenthal:** 好的。谢谢。那个有点太明显了，抱歉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Thank you. That one was a little obvious I'm sorry.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 不，很好，我喜欢它直截了当。我确实理解了这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No it's good I like that it was straightforward. I actually got this one. Okay.</p>
</details>

**Tracy Alloway:** 实际上你知道吗？我还非常欣赏Max对他们正在用AI做的事情给出了实质性的答案，而不仅仅是代码生成。即使听起来财务部门可能仍然在用它进行代码生成，这很有道理。比如能够主动扫描网站，找出谁在声称关于Affirm的不实信息等等。所以也许所有这些技术都有生产性用途，或者正在自动发送数百万份合同。完全正确。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Actually you know what? I really also appreciated that Max had substantive answers for things that they're doing with AI that aren't just code generation. Even if it sounds like the finance department is probably still using it for code generation, like that makes a lot of sense. Like being able to proactively scan websites to say who is sort of, claiming something that's not true about a firm, etc.. So maybe there are productive uses of all this technology or is sending out millions and millions of contracts automatically. Totally.</p>
