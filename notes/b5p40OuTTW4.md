### 开场与奥兹医生加入公共服务

**主持人**: 好了，各位，欢迎回来。这里是达沃斯的“全力以赴”。我的好友**David Saxs**在这里。我们玩得很开心。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: All right, everybody. Welcome back. It's all in at Davos. My bestie, David Saxs, is here. We're having a great time.

</details>

**主持人**: 你们能看到背景吗？太棒了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Can you guys catch this in the background? Amazing.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 太美了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: It's stunning.

</details>

**主持人**: 这就是达沃斯的体验。它看起来很真实。我知道。嗯，从这里看有点像绿幕，因为它太如画了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: This is the Davos experience. It looks real. I know. Well, it kind of looks like a green screen from here cuz it's just so picturesque.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 它简直就像一个...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: It's literally like a

</details>

**主持人**: 绿幕。是的，它是真实的，真材实料。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: green screen. It is. It's the real the real deal.

</details>

**主持人**: 我们会在这里俯瞰边缘。你们会看到所有那些宣扬美德的ESG、DEI高管。嗯，你们会看到，这种氛围弥漫在整个区域。他们在这里的每栋建筑上都安装了太阳能电池板，但没有一个插电的，只是为了美观。但**David**和我非常兴奋，嗯，能在这里做很多采访。哇，今天我们为大家带来了一场精彩的访谈。我们将和**奥兹医生**（Dr. Midas）谈论健康和医疗系统。他现在是**CMS**（医疗保险和医疗补助服务中心）的行政长官。可以说，你从“美国医生”变成了像我朋友**David Saxs**一样的公务员。你为什么选择在事业巅峰时期投身这样的公共服务呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And we'll we'll look over the ledge here. And what you'll see is all of the virtue signaling ESG DEI executives. And uh you'll you'll just it's emanating from this entire area. And they've put solar over every single building here. None of it's plugged in. It's just for aesthetics. But uh we're really excited, David and I, um to do a bunch of interviews here. Wow. Today we've got a great one for you. And we're going to talk about health and we're going to talk about the health care system with none other than Dr. Midas. Uh you're the administrator now for CMS. You've gone from being America's doctor, dare I say, to being a civil servant like my friend David Saxs. Why did you choose really height of your powers career to to go into public service like this?

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 我从事变革工作，你们也是。如果你从事变革工作，而你所追求的项目没有带来重大改变，那么你就会想转向其他能产生你所期望影响的事情。尤其是在医疗保健领域，我们没有奢侈地浪费数年生命去追求那些无法真正改变生活质量和美国人民机会的兴趣。所以，尽管我热爱做电视节目主持人，我做了13年，我热爱外科手术，我一生都在做直到最近。嗯，这是我做过的最好的工作。这是我做过的最好的工作，因为我能与那些人一起工作，也因为你确实能实现我渴望的改变。我认为很多人看播客的原因是他们也想改变一些事情。我鼓励大家，你知道，大胆尝试，偶尔会搞砸一些事情。但如果你想有意义地改变基础设施，无论什么困扰你，嗯，你都必须全力以赴。而本届政府为我们提供了独特的机遇来实现这一点。这很有趣，**David**。嗯，你以前也习惯了相当快的节奏。然后我想我们的期望是，嘿，你进入公共服务，那将是关于建立共识，需要很多时间。无论你怎么说**特朗普**，有些人可能不同意他的每一项政策，但他办事。他就像一个创始人，快速地推出产品。这也是你的经验。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: So, I'm in the change business. You guys are as well. And if you're in the change business and the project you're pursuing is not making a significant change, then you want to move on to something else that could make the impact you desire. And especially in healthcare, we don't have the luxury of fooling around for years of our lives pursuing uh interests that don't result in meaningfully changing the the quality of life, but also the opportunity that the American people have. And so although I loved being a TV host, did it for 13 years, I love practicing surgery, which I've done my whole life till recently. Uh this is the best job I've ever had. And it's the best job I've had because of the people that I get to work with, but also because you truly do get to make the change that I desire. And I think a lot of folks, the reason they watch the podcast is they they want to change stuff, too. And I encourage everybody to, you know, take some big swings and you'll break things once in a while. But if you want to be able to change meaningfully the the infrastructure, whatever's bothering you, uh, you got to go at full speed. And this administration offers us a unique opportunity to do that. It is interesting, David. Um, you were used to going at a pretty fast pace as well. And then I think our expectation was, hey, you get into public service, it's going to be about consensus building and it's going to take a lot of time. Say what you will about Trump. Some people might not agree with every policy, but he ships. He's like a founder who ships and ships product fast. That's also been your experience.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 是的，他很难跟上。我的意思是，他行动非常快，这让他成为一个非常有趣的老板，因为他想把事情做好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Yeah, he's hard to keep up with. I mean, he moves incredibly fast and it makes him really fun to work for because he wants to get things done.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 他每天都想把事情做好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Every day he wants to get things done.

</details>

**主持人**: 有一种紧迫感。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: There's a sense of urgency.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 是的。你知道，你会和总统在椭圆形办公室开会，你会告诉他一个问题。他的第一反应是拿起电话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Yeah. And you know, you'll be in a meeting with the president in the Oval Office and you'll tell him about a problem. His first instinct is to pick up the phone

</details>

**主持人**: 然后立刻打电话解决。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: and call and fix it right then and there.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 他开完一个又一个会，一个小时又一个小时，一天又一天，一周又一周地这样做。当你把这种想把事情做好的愿望和他立刻采取行动结合起来时，它会产生巨大的影响。他似乎很乐意把人们聚集在一起，尤其是在本届政府中，我认为这与他第一届政府明显不同。他刚接触政治时，引入了很多职业政客，我认为也许人们告诉他这些人是合适的人选。这次他明确地去寻找那些有专业知识、在各自领域被证明是赢家的人，包括你自己。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: And he does that meeting after meeting, hour after hour, day after day, week after week. And when you compound that desire to get things done and he acts on it right there, it has a huge impact. and he seems to get great pleasure in bringing together especially in this administration which I think is distinctly different than the first first administration he was new to politics and he brought in a lot of career politicians that I think maybe people told him were the right people this time he has explicitly gone and looked for people with expertise who are proven winners in the field yourself included

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 他希望我们能承担责任。我认为在政府的各个部门，他都希望个人不必总是依赖总统来讲述故事，因为媒体中反映的很多叙述都完全偏离了事实。我甚至不是说他们是故意的。他们根本不理解你所做决定的次级和三级影响。因此，我们的工作是不仅要告诉媒体，还要告诉美国人民我们在努力做什么。如果你以非正统的方式执政，这一点尤其重要。这至少在**CMS**是一个根本性的重要现实。**David**，我不知道在**AI**开发领域情况如何，那里以前可能根本就没有规则手册，但在医疗保健领域，你知道，自从人类五万年前离开非洲以来，医生就一直存在于营地中。所以有一套行事方式。在政府中也存在这种方式，但它并非总是正确的行事方式。所以，举例来说，我们有能力制定法律。政府的每个部门几乎都可以。我们让国会做一些事情。结果并不总是如你所愿，而且需要很多时间。谈判的最终结果有时会差强人意。你有规章制度，这是第二个大领域，也就是像我们这样的行政实体可以制定每个人都必须遵守的规则。我们会付给你这么多钱。我们不会再让这些人做那些事了。嗯，这确实需要一些时间。嗯，而且它容易受到法律战的影响。我的意思是，如果你所监管的人不喜欢你所说的，他们可以起诉你，他们可以阻止你。在本届政府中，如果对方不喜欢你正在做的事情，即使那是最好的事情，我们有一项可以减少欺诈的规则，但蓝州城市不喜欢它，因为它来自他们不喜欢的人，总统。所以他们阻止了它，现在这事被卷入了法庭。现在，我们会赢，但这可能需要数年时间。所以，这是第二种主要方式，对吧？所以，你制定法律，你通过规则。第三种方式，历史上政府我认为没有尽可能有效地使用过。而这位总统，因为他是一位伟大的谈判者，能够以历史上从未有过的方式推动我们，那就是仅仅利用召集的力量。美国政府可以把通常不会交谈的人聚集在一起。他们可以为行业提供一个安全的港湾，让他们聚集在一起讨论历史上他们会回避的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: he wants us to carry the water and this I think across the different parts of the administ ministration. He wants individuals that don't have to rely on the president to tell the story all the time because so much of the narrative that is reflected in the media is just completely off. I'm not even saying that they're doing it on purpose. They literally don't understand some of the secondary and tertiary impact of the decisions you're making. And it's our job to therefore tell not just the media, but the American people what we're trying to do. And that's especially important if you're unorthodox in how you govern. And this is a fundamentally important reality, at least at CMS. David, I don't know how it is in developing AI where there probably wasn't a rule book before anyway, but in healthcare, you know, there have been doctors since the dawn of of, you know, since humans left Africa 50,000 years ago, there were doctors in the encampment. And so there is a way of doing things. And in government, that exists as well, but it's not always the right way to do things. So, for example, we have the ability to make laws. Every part of the administration pretty much can. We get Congress to do stuff. It doesn't always turn out the way you want it to turn out, and it takes a lot of time. and the negotiated final result uh sometimes falls short. You have rulemaking, second big area, which is, you know, administrative entities like ours can write the rules that everyone has to follow. We're going to pay you this much. We're not going to let these people do that anymore. Uh it does take some time. Uh and it's prone to lawfare. By that, I mean the people you're regulating, if they don't like what you're saying, they can sue you and they can stop you. And in this administration, if the other party doesn't like what you're doing, even if it's the best thing, we had a a rule that would reduce fraud, but the blue cities didn't like it because it was coming from someone they didn't like, the president. So, they enjoined it, and that's now caught up in court. Now, we'll win, but it could take years. So, that's the second big way, right? So, you make laws, you pass rules. The third way, which historically government has not used, I don't think as effectively as possible. And this president, because he's a great negotiator, is able to to push us in ways that historically not been done, is to just use the power to convene. The US government can bring people together who would not normally talk. They can give safe harbor to industry to come together and discuss problems that historically they would shy away.

### 药品定价与医疗投资

**主持人**: 最好的例子是什么？我很好奇是不是那些制药公司，他们会蒙受损失，因为**特朗普总统**一直非常明确：“嘿，我希望这些价格降低。我们为什么要在牌桌上当冤大头？我们支付的价格是加拿大支付的10倍。”这是你目前为止最好的例子吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What's the great example of that? I'm I'm wondering if it's the drug companies who they have something to lose because Trump's been President Trump has been very clear. Hey, I want these prices lowered. Why are we the sucker at the poker table? We're paying 10 times what Canada's paying. Is that the best example in your experience so far?

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 这是一个很好的例子。最惠国药品定价。它专门解决了你概述的问题，那就是我们为在美国同一家工厂生产的完全相同的产品支付的费用，比我们在欧洲的同行高出很多。所以总统说我们需要改变这一点。所以他说去和制药公司谈谈，嗯，为他们创造一些风险机会，你知道，制定一些规则，创建一些项目，如果我们采取行动，真的会伤害他们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: It's a great example. Most favored nation drug pricing. It specifically addresses the problem you outlined, which is we just pay a bunch more for the exact same product made the same factory often in America than our counterparts do here in Europe. So the president says we need to change that. So he says go talk to the drug companies uh create some opportunities for risk for them you know make some rules create some pro projects that if we were to act on them would really hurt them

</details>

**主持人**: 一点点压力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: a little pressure

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 一点点压力，你知道，造出撬棍和棒球棒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: little pressure you know build the crowbars and the baseball bats

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: okay

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 砍下一些树，打磨木头，但不要使用它们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: cut some trees down hone the wood but don't use them

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 他非常明确地表示，不要损害制药业的创新性质，它们对我们国家很重要，它们能拯救生命。嗯，我们希望拥有世界上最具创新性的产业，因为那是我们实现差异化的机会所在。这也是我们国家命运的一部分，要做到最好。所以，不要损害这个行业，但要从中挤出一些“肥肉”，把它拉回来，回馈给美国人民。此外，这也是公平的做事方式。打个比方，当你想到北约，总统对北约国家说，我们都在一起保护自己免受外部威胁。你们必须投入更多的钱。我们也会投入更多，嗯，但要按比例更多。这必须是公平的。他们几乎都做到了，除了一两个例外。他对制药业也做了同样的事情。他说存在外部威胁，比如俄罗斯或外国政府。也存在内部威胁，比如癌症。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: and he's very specifically said do not hurt the innovative nature of pharmaceuticals they are important to our nation they save lives uh We want to have the most innovative industries in the world because that's where the opportunities are to differentiate ourselves. It's also part of our national destiny. Be the best. So don't hurt the industry, but take some of the fat out of it. Pull it back and give it to the American people. Plus, it's the fair way of doing things. And metaphorically, when you think about NATO and the president saying to NATO countries, we're all in it together to protect ourselves against external threats. You guys got to put up more money. We'll put up more uh but proportionally more. It's got to be fair. And they all did that pretty much with one or two exceptions. He did the same thing with pharmaceuticals. He said there's an external threat which is Russia or you know foreign governments. There's internal threats like cancer.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 所以我们希望每个人都出力。在美国，我们GDP的8%用于药品。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: So we want everyone to chip in. We pay in United States 8% of our GDP towards pharmaceutical products.

</details>

**主持人**: 8%？我们GDP的1%用于药品。那不是医疗系统，我认为医疗系统是17%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: 8% 1% of our GDP goes to drugs. That's not the health care system which I think is 17%.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: Right.

</details>

**主持人**: 其中1%，我们医疗保健总费用的整整6%直接流向了制药公司。所以我们希望...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: 1% of it a full 6% of our healthcare goes just directly to the drug companies. So we want

</details>

**David Saxs**: 你的数学怎么回事？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: What's with your math?

</details>

**主持人**: 相当相当令人印象深刻。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It's quite quite impressive.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 是的，谢谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Yeah. Thank you.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 我之所以提到这一点，是因为这里的百分比很重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: So point I only bring this up because the percentages make a difference here. 08%

</details>

**主持人**: 来自我们玩二十一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: comes from us playing blackjack.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 计算器。我知道你来自我们一起玩二十一点和扑克。我在这里输了很多钱，两个小时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Calculator to this. I know you comes from us playing blackjack and poker together. You I've lost a lot two hours over here.

</details>

**主持人**: 我，嗯，我输给这家伙很多钱，我不再和他下棋了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I Well, I've been I've lost a lot of money to this guy and I don't play him in chess anymore.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 弯曲但不折断。你希望他们稍微弯曲一点，合理一点，但你不想作为一个医生去摧毁这个行业。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: Bend but don't break. You want them to bend a little bit. Be reasonable but you don't want to break the industry as a doctor.

</details>

**主持人**: 这有什么结果呢？因为你经常听到“可负担性”这个词。所以普通美国人将为他们的药品支付更少的钱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What's the upshot of this? Because you hear this term affordability a lot. So the average American's going to pay less for their drug prices.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 我们将支付更少。欧洲人，我们正在告诉所有国家，我们正在进行这些讨论。我们刚刚让英国同意了，其他国家也在和我们谈论他们支付的费用。他们支付0.3%。所以他们花费的百分比不到我们支付的一半。他们之所以能做到这一点，是因为他们的人民没有意识到，如果你在欧洲得了癌症，更晚期的癌症，你的生存率远低于美国。如果你无法获得药物，他们平均要比美国晚几年才能获得，是的，你可以以更便宜的价格获得，但你的人民正在为此付出代价。这是我今天将要传达的最重要的信息。最重要的信息是，不要把医疗保健看作是一种开支。把它看作是一种投资，因为如果我能让普通美国人多工作一年，因为我以更好的价格为他们提供了药物，他们没有在药店里转身离开，或者因为我们能够做其他正确的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: We're going to pay less. The Europeans, we are telling the all the countries, we're in the middle of these discussions. We've just gotten the British to say yes and other countries are talking to us about the fact that they pay.3%. So less than half of what we paid percentwise is being spent by them. And and they get away with it because their people don't realize that if you get cancer, more advanced cancers in Europe, your survival rate's way below the US. And if you don't if you don't get access to the drugs, which they don't for several years on average that we get in the US, yes, you can get it for cheaper, but your people are paying a price. And this is going to say the most important message I'm going to deliver today. The most important message is don't think about healthcare like an expense. Think of it as an investment because if I can get the average American to work one year longer because I got them a medication at a better price, they didn't turn away at the drugstore or because we able to do something else correct

</details>

**主持人**: 无论环境如何，无论运动如何。我们会谈论所有这些，但如果你能让普通美国人多工作一年，那对美国经济来说价值3万亿美元。这是巨大的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: whatever the envir the movement. We'll talk about all this, but if you can get the average American to work one year longer, that is worth $3 trillion to the US economy. It's massive.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 所以，我们需要让人们感觉最好，让他们对自己的未来有掌控感，有信心能在世界上有所作为，这样他们就会想继续在工作场所努力。而这额外的一年，顺便说一句，也让他们更接近**Medicare**（联邦医疗保险），这也有助于应对我们国家面临的其他金融危机。所以，这是正确思考问题的方式。降低实际的医疗成本。不要只是向系统投入更多的钱。降低实际的医疗成本，这样我们花的钱就能获得更多的价值。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: So, we we need to get people feeling their best, feeling that they have agency over their future with confidence that they're going to make a difference in the world so they want to keep trying to do it at the workplace. And that extra one year, which gets them closer to Medicare, by the way, also helps deal with other financial crises that we're facing as a nation. So, this is the way to think about it the right way. Get the actual cost of care down. Don't just pay more money into the system. Get the actual cost of care down so the money we're spending gets us more value.

</details>

**主持人**: 我们花费是那些拥有全民医保的国家两倍。现在，你确实指出他们获得服务的时间较晚。所以我们有一个更好的系统，但我们为此付出了巨大的代价。这会是描述当前状况的准确方式吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: We're spending twice as much as these other countries who have universal healthcare. Now, you did point out that they get things later. So, we have a better system, but we pay through the nose for it. That that would be an accurate way of describing the current state of affairs.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 精确的表述。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: Precisely stated. Yes.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。那么，我们如何让每个美国人都能获得医疗保健呢？因为我相信我们很多的紧张情绪都来自于那些可能不像现在播客上的人那么富裕的人的恐惧，他们生活在这种恐惧中。我们没有这种恐惧。我们知道如果我们需要医疗保健，我们会想办法解决。我们会自己支付，或者保险会支付。但有些人因此破产。我相信你作为一个医生，会支持全民医保。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Okay. So, how do we get every American healthcare? because I believe a lot of the tension we have comes from a fear from people maybe who are not as well off as as the people on the pod right now and they live with that fear. We don't live with that fear. We know if we need to get healthcare, we're going to figure it out. We'll be able to pay for it out of pocket or insurance will pay for it. But there are people who go bankrupt because of this. You believe in universal healthcare. I would assume as a doctor.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 我希望每个人都能获得医疗保健。但我们如何支付是这里的决定性问题。你如何保持系统有动力来照顾你？如果我告诉美国每个人你们有医疗保健，然后我告诉医生，给他们医疗保健，但他们不处理财务成本，那么你就会突然开始限制获得医疗服务的机会。所以你可以像在社会化医疗国家那样获得医疗保健。你只是需要等待6个月或一年或更长时间，或者你根本无法获得医疗服务。当你开始和美国人讨论这个问题时，他们会说：“等等，等等，等一下。是的，我当然希望以可负担的价格获得医疗保健。”但根本问题是，我到底要等多长时间才能真正获得医疗服务？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: I want everyone to have access to health care. But how we pay for it is the defining issue here. How do you keep the system incentivized to take care of you? If I tell everybody in America that you have healthare and then I tell the doctors, give them healthare, but they don't deal with the financial costs of then you all of a sudden start to restrict the access to care. So you can get the health care like you do in socialized medicine countries. You just have to wait 6 months or a year or longer or you don't get the care at all. And when you start having that discussion with Americans, they say, "Wait, wait, hold on a second. Yes, of course I want uh to get the healthcare for an affordable price." But the question the fundamental question is how long till I actually get the care there

</details>

**主持人**: 被拒绝是他们生活中的一部分。所以他们抱怨他们的全民医保。我们抱怨没有全民医保。那两者有什么区别呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: being denied is something they live with. So they complain about their universal healthcare. We complain about not having universal healthcare. What are the two or

</details>

**David Saxs**: 我会关注的是国际上寻求治疗的患者流动情况。我听到很多关于加拿大人来美国接受治疗的故事，因为他们不想等两年才能做某个手术，不是最新的那种，就是某个普通手术，因为他们可能两年内就死了。所以他们来这里。我没听说有美国人谈论去加拿大接受治疗。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: the thing I would look at is the flow of patients who seek treatment internationally. So I hear lots of stories about Canadians coming to the US to get treatment because they don't want to wait two years for some proced not just the latest to get some procedure because they could be dead in 2 years. So they come here. I don't hear any Americans talking about going to Canada to get treatment.

</details>

**主持人**: 实际上，我们确实有一些例子，在需要自费的手术和治疗方面。美容、牙科，人们会去，这已经成为一种旅游。确实有人会改变地点，是的，为了电子手术。你提到了美容手术，这绝对是一个趋势。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: We actually do have uh a number of examples of that in surgeries and treatments that you have to pay for out of pocket. Cosmetic, dental, people are going and this has become tourism and there are people who do change locations. Yes. for electron procedures. You mentioned cosmetic surgery. That's definitely a trend.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 嗯，而且美国也有一些我们不做手术。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: Uh and also there's some procedures that we don't do in America.

</details>

**主持人**: 干细胞。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Stem cells,

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 但你的干细胞还在通过监管程序。但更大的问题是**David**提出的那个，那就是大多数美国人抱怨医疗系统崩溃了。几乎没有人会为了危及生命的问题而离开美国寻求顶级医疗服务。所以我们有这种奇怪的机会。我确实认为这是一个机会。我们如何才能以可持续的价格，为需要它的人提供顶级医疗服务？这就是我认为你的专业领域发挥作用的地方。在本届政府之前，我认为因为我们没有合适的技术来令人信服地承诺我们可以做到这一点，所以人们对做出重大改变犹豫不决。我们正在大胆尝试，因为我们认为**AI**已经准备好了。我们认为医疗保健领域可能发生的技术转型值得补贴。我的意思是，让顶级企业家能够构建应用程序，帮助你应对糖尿病等医疗危机，我们可以在系统中投入资金，让这些事情变得值得你去做。这样你就可以获得投资者的支持。你可以获得公平的估值。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: but your stem cells there that they're still going through the regulatory process. But the the the bigger issue is really is the one David's raising, which is most Americans complain that the health care system is broken. Almost none would leave the country to get top tier health care for a life-threatening problem. And so we have this sort of bizarre opportunity. I do think it's an opportunity. How do we make the top tier health care available to to folks who need it but do it at a price that is sustainable? And that's where I think your specialty area comes into play. Before this administration, I think because we didn't have the right technologies to promise convincingly that we could do this, there was a hesitancy to make big shifts. We're taking big swings because we think AI is ready. We think the tech transformation that's that's that could happen in healthcare is worth subsidizing. And by that I mean making it possible for top tier entrepreneurs who are building apps that can help you deal with the medical crisis that you're dealing with their diabetes. We can put money into the system to make that worth you doing. So you can get investors to support you. You can get a fair valuation.

### AI赋能医疗与自我导向健康

**主持人**: 降低成本的技术。显然这是一个巨大的胜利。让我问你一个医生会遇到的难题。最近有研究表明，**大型语言模型**（LLMs）目前不仅能提供比普通全科医生更好的建议，它们还有更好的医患沟通方式，患者更喜欢**LLM**而不是全科医生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: The technology to lower the price. Obviously that's a huge win. Let me ask you the the difficult question as a doctor. There have been studies that came out recently that not only do LLMs currently give better advice than the average general practitioner, they have better bedside manner and the customers or the patients enjoy the LLM more than they enjoyed a GP.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 你在哪里看到的？我没见过。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: Where did you see that? I haven't seen that.

</details>

**主持人**: 这是哈佛或麻省理工学院最近发布的一项研究。我会把它放在节目笔记里，但这相当具有开创性。如果你要去一个新社会，你会怎么想？这种你必须去看全科医生，他们问你一堆问题，然后他们查阅医学文献，找出建议，这是最好的方式吗？或者对于普通感冒、脚踝扭伤，像大多数没有保险的美国人或自我导向的人那样，他们使用**大型语言模型**，它会说“这是你处理这些问题的方法”，然后他们自己处理，可以解决一些问题，这样会不会更好？难道不应该让他们自己做这些事情，然后再决定是否去看全科医生吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: This is a study that came out of either Harvard or MIT. I I'll put it in the show notes, but this is a pretty groundbreaking. What are your thoughts if you were going to a new society? Is this idea that you have to go to the GP, they ask you a bunch of questions, then they go on their medical text, figure out what their advice is, is that the best modality or would it be better for the common cold for an ankle sprain to do what most Americans without insurance are doing or people who are self-directed? They go on a large language model. It says here's how you deal with these issues and they do it themselves and they can take care of a couple things. Wouldn't it be better to just have them do this stuff and then decide if they should go see their GP?

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 我认为这有一个混合模式，可以在早期稍微降低风险。**幻觉**等问题确实存在，美国人对此非常不容忍。我们实际上理解拥有医学博士学位的人犯错。我们认为**AI**是完美的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: I think there's a hybrid of that that derisks it a little bit early on. There are definitely problems with hallucination and the like that that Americans we very intolerant to. We actually understand if a human being who has an MD degree makes a mistake. We think AI is perfect

</details>

**主持人**: 并且完全无法容忍哪怕是轻微的违规行为。你之前说的没错，这些研究现在已经做了好几次了。**大型语言模型**在委员会考试中表现更好。所以，在一般知识方面，它们比医生更好。它们比医生更有耐心。如果你和一个**AI**驱动的虚拟形象交谈，它们会整天回答关于糖尿病的同样10个问题，而不会感到厌烦。和一位全科医生交谈，在他们和10个问了同样10个问题的糖尿病患者交谈之后，你会发现他们的回答会有点不耐烦。这只是人性。我不想每次都回答同样的问题，但那是患者需要你做的。所以我认为我们有机会，我们研究了一些这样的模型。事实上，**John Door**邀请了一群非常有思想的企业家来到大楼，讨论我们是否有可能让普通全科医生的效率提高五倍，甚至十倍。现在，重点来了。美国的全科医生不够。我们可能需要两到三倍的全科医生才能跟上欧洲的水平，仅仅是人均而言。我们远远低于这个水平，因为我的儿子刚刚医学院毕业。在他去的哥伦比亚大学医学院，没有多少孩子会成为全科医生。他们都想成为眼科医生和骨科医生，因为那些专业的收入更高。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: and are completely intolerant of even a minor uh transgression. What you said earlier is true and these studies have been done several times now. the the the large language models do better on board exams. So, ab general knowledge, they're better than a doctor. They're more patient than a doctor. If you talk to an AI uh informed avatar, they'll answer the same 10 questions on diabetes all day long and not get bored. Talk to a general practitioner after they've talked to 10 patients with diabetes who've asked the same 10 questions, you get a little tur in your responses. That's just human nature. I don't want to answer the same question every time, but that's what patients need you to do. So I think we have the opportunity and we looked at some of these models. Uh in fact John Door brought a bunch of very thoughtful entrepreneurs into the building to talk about the possibility of us taking the average general practitioner and making them five times maybe even 10 times more efficient. Now here's the big deal. There are not enough GPS in America. We probably need two to three times more just to keep up with Europe just per capita. We're way below because my son just finished medical school. There aren't many kids in medical school at Colombia where he went who are going to become GPS. They all want to be opthalmologists and, you know, orthopedic surgeons because they pay a lot more

</details>

**David Saxs**: 而且他们有大笔贷款。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: and they got big loans for their uh

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 是的。他们负债累累。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: Yeah. And they're in debt. They're in debt.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。即使哥伦比亚大学是免费的。如果你没有钱，你不需要支付哥伦比亚大学的学费。他们这样做是为了让孩子们从事全科医疗，但尚未达到预期的效果。但更广泛的问题是，在这个过渡时期，我们如何让**AI**发挥作用，让人们感到自信？一种方法是让它完成大部分工作，然后，特别是通过**代理式AI**，消除文书工作和繁琐的工作，并向医生提供关键信息。我作为医生最重要的事情是什么？我看着你的眼睛，我解读你，我试图与你建立联系。我们大脑皮层50%的高级认知功能是用来解读你的面部表情的。我们天生就是社会性动物。要理解那些细微之处，**David**感到无聊了，你没有。我必须改变节奏。我必须回到他那里。他正在脑子里做算牌。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. And this is even Colombia is free. If you don't, if you don't have money, you don't have to pay tuition at Colombia. They did that so that kids would go into general practice and hasn't had the desired impact yet. But the broader question is how do we allow AI to play a role as this transition period happens so people feel confident and one way of doing it is to allow it to do most of the work and then especially with agentic AI take the paperwork out of it the busy work out of it and feed the doctor the key information. What's the most important thing I do as a doctor? I look at you in the eyes and I read you and I try to connect with you. 50% of our cortex of our co high cognitive function 50% of it is to read your face. We're hardwired to be social animals. To understand the subtle little David's bored, you're not. I got to change the pacing. I got to get back to him. He's doing card calculations in his head.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 公平地说，**David**昨晚一直忙到凌晨一点。他们拖着他参加了四个会议。我晚上睡在床上。我睡得很好。我有我的**Whoop**。我有我的睡眠分数。我是一个像你一样的“枕头公主”，**奥兹医生**。我听说你对睡眠非常讲究。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: He was, in fairness to David, he was out till 1:00 a.m. They dragged him to four meetings. I was in bed at night. I have good sleep. I got my Whoop. I got my sleep score. I am a pillow princess like you, Dr. Oz. I hear that you're extreme about your sleep.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 嗯，我睡得很好。我妻子是世界级的睡眠者。她带着自己的枕头。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: Well, I'm a good sleep. My wife is a world-class sleeper. She brings her own pillows.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 顺便说一句，你妻子很可爱。在你上台之前，我采访了**Lisa**一个小时。我当时想，“哇，她真令人印象深刻。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Your wife is delightful, by the way. I I did an hour interview with Lisa before you even got on stage here. I was like, "Wow, she's impressive."

</details>

**主持人**: 补充这一点，我的意思是，我认为这很有趣。我认为我们将拥有更聪明的医生和更聪明的患者，他们每个人都将使用自己版本的**AI**。

<details>
<summary>主持人**: To build on this point, I mean, I think it's interesting. I think we're going to get smarter doctors and smarter patients, and they're each going to use their own version of AI.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 所以，你知道，患者将使用的是消费产品，**GPT-4o**、**Grock**等等。我认为有趣的是，当他们可以导入他们的血常规报告时，因为**AI**非常擅长阅读PDF，你知道，只是非结构化数据。所以，你把所有东西都导入进去。你要求诊断，你变得更聪明。你可以研究自己的病情。你坦率地说，不会因为问一些基本的消费问题而浪费医生的时间。你是一个更好的客户。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: So, you know, what patients are going to use is a is a consumer product, JBT, Grock, you know, and so forth. What's interesting, I think, is when they can dump in their blood panels cuz cuz AI is so good at reading PDFs, you know, just unstructured data. So, you dump all your stuff in it. You ask for a diagnosis, you get smarter. You can research your own condition. You're not wasting frankly the doctor's time by asking basic consumer. You're a better customer.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以你带着更多的知识去，然后医生他们可以使用**ChatGPT**或者其他什么，但实际上他们使用的是我见过的更专业的工具。它们会直接给你一个医学期刊的引用，你可以带去。这对医生来说非常重要。所以，你知道，它不会产生**幻觉**。只是从**Joe Rogan**播客上获得答案，你需要知道来源是什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So you go more educated and then the doctors they can use chat GBT or what have you, but actually they're using specialized much more specialized tools that the ones I've seen. They will give you a citation directly to a medical journal that you can bring. That's very important to doctors. So, you know, it's not hallucinating. Just getting the answer from a, you know, from a was on Joe Rogan podcast, you need to know what the source is,

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 这很好。如果你从**Joe**那里获得信息，然后追溯到受人尊敬的医学期刊。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: which is fine. If you if you get information from Joe and backwards to respected medical journal,

</details>

**主持人**: 让我问你关于这个趋势。这是**自我导向医疗**。有**Function Health**在做血液检测，**Superpower**，**Whoop**刚刚开始提供。**Aura**，**Apple Watch**，**HLEP**，我是那个的投资者。完全披露，它做得很好。这些东西现在把所有这些数据整合在一起，开始告诉你你的寿命，你的健康寿命，你的，你知道，你的实际年龄和你的健康年龄。我不确定那个指标是什么，但人们现在正在测量事物，并从中获得一些知识，然后去看全科医生。我遇到的问题是，我不是价格敏感型的人。我可以找任何我想要的私人医生。目前很少有医生愿意这样工作。这必须改变。但你如何看待这群新的从事**自我导向医疗**的人，他们每年做两次血液检测，将其放入数据库？嗯，**POVA**的3D扫描，**Nico**，**Daniel X**，一家新公司在做300美元的全身扫描。所有这些会是范式转变吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: let me ask you about this trend. This is self-directed healthcare. There's function health doing blood labs, superpower, whoop just started offering them. Aura, Apple Watch, HLEP, I'm an investor in that one. Full disclosure, it's doing great. These things are now putting all that data together and starting to tell you your life, your health span, your, you know, your actual age versus your health age. I don't sure what that metric is, but people are now measuring things and getting some knowledge of this and then going to a GP. The problem I'm having is, and I'm not price sensitive. I could get any concierge doctor I want. There's very few doctors who want to work like this at the moment. That's something's got to change. But what do you think of this new group of people who are doing self-directed healthcare doing two blood labs a year putting it into a database? Uh POVA with the 3D scans, Nico, Daniel X, new company doing a $300 full body scan. All of this is this going to be the paradigm shift?

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 80/20法则。如果20%的美国人像你说的这样做，他们会的，是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: 8020 rule. If 20% of Americans do what you're saying, and they will, yeah,

</details>

**主持人**: 这将使整个医疗系统运作得更好。我实际上更担心光谱的另一端。告诉我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: it'll make all of medicine function better. I'm actually concerned about the other end of the spectrum. Tell me

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 那些不去看医生的人，**Medicaid**（医疗补助）患者，**Medicaid**患者的可能性是两倍。**Medicaid**是那些脆弱的、收入较少的人，嗯，他们正在获得政府医疗保险，对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: the people who don't go to their doctors, Medicaid patients, Medicaid patients are twice as likely. Medicaid is the folks who are vulnerable, who are, you know, have made less money, uh, they're getting government health insurance, right?

</details>

**主持人**: **Medicare**（联邦医疗保险）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Medicare,

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 那是我们的全民医保，对吗？那是我们需要帮助的地方。**Medicaid**患者，因为他们没有能力支付医疗费用，他们取消医生预约的可能性是**Medicare**患者的两倍。所以，很难照顾他们。现在，他们有两份工作。如果他们提前下班，他们就会被解雇。他们没有调整日程的灵活性。他们没有交通工具。他们不出现的理由有很多。但如果我无法为他们提供医疗保健，那对我们来说是一个重大危机。因此，**AI**真正的机会在于**医疗保健的民主化**。是的。看，你们已经很聪明了。你们刚刚随口列举了十多家公司，它们都在做着出色的工作。大多数人根本不知道这些公司存在，也不知道它们做什么，对吧？所以，如果我能把我的实验室数据输入**AI**，而我对医疗保健知之甚少，我就可以以一种我能处理的方式，在我准备好听的时候，获得信息。现在我再给你一个可能有用的数据点。所有**Medicare**患者，所有65岁以上的老年人，每年都会获得一次免费的健康检查。有多少人接受了他们的免费体检？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: that is our universal healthare, right? That's that's where we need help. The chance of a Medicaid patient who doesn't pay for their health care because they don't have the means to do it. The chance of them canceling their doctor's appointment is twice that of a Medicare patient. And so, it's hard to take care of them. Now, they they have two jobs. They'll get fired if they leave the job early. They don't have the the the flexibility of moving their calendar around. They don't have transportation. There's lots of reasons they don't show. But if I can't get healthcare to them, that's a major crisis for us. And so the real opportunity for AI is democratizing healthcare. Yes. See, you guys are already smart. You just listed off top of your head a dozen companies all doing great work. Most people have no idea these companies exist or what they do exist, right? And so if I can put into to AI my labs and I don't know much about healthare I can get information sent to me in a way that I can process it and at the time I'm ready to hear it. Now I'll give you one more data point that might be useful. All Medicare patients, all seniors over 65, all of them are given a free wellness exam every year. What percentage of people take their free medical exam with?

</details>

**David Saxs**: 少于5%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Less than 5%.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 不，没那么糟。少于50%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: No, it's not that bad. It's less than 50%.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 少于50%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Less than 50%.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 好的。但大多数人不做。它就在那里。我们认为发生这种情况的部分原因是你不重视它。这里有一个更重要的数据点。那些真正去看医生的人认为自己病得更重，但他们实际上比不去看医生的人健康得多，因为无知是福。那些不去看医生或寻求任何健康建议的人认为自己做得很好。而实际上，客观地说，他们的情况要糟糕得多。所以，我们有机会通过说：“好的，我会在你所在的地方与你见面。你不在乎去看医生，即使它是免费的。它属于你，在这个我们正在构建的新健康科技生态系统中。我与**Amy Gleason**在一起，她也管理着**Doge**，你知道，帮助推广这一切。我们正在让每个科技公司更容易参与。600家公司签署了一项承诺，同意**互操作性**和**数据透明度**，并为美国人民构建这些工具，以便他们能够使用。现在，一旦我授权你更好地照顾自己，你就会改变系统。因为当你向医生提问时，第一次你是唯一的病人，他们不会注意。第二个问同样问题的病人，我们就会改变。作为一名医生，我告诉你，有病人推动我们关注，例如，在医生办公室里**环境信息收集**，这有助于我们。所以，我得到一份关于你告诉我的医疗报告。为什么？因为医生告诉病人的50%在病人离开办公室之前就被忘记了。所以，当你的孩子问你，嘿，医生怎么说的？你不记得了。你很紧张。你很焦虑。医生说得很快。用大词。把所有这些都分解开来。然后突然之间，信息就能轻松流动。现在你有了更多的利益相关者。谁是最终的利益相关者？病人。所以，历史上被医疗记录公司劫持的医疗记录。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: Okay. But most people don't do it. It's there. And part of the reason we think that's happening is you don't prioritize it. And here's the more important data point. People who actually see their doctor think they're sicker, but they're actually much healthier than people who don't see their doctor because ignorance is bliss. People don't go to their doc or seek any kind of health advice think that they're doing great. And actually, objectively, they're doing much worse. So, we have an opportunity to democratize this by saying, "Okay, I'm going to meet you where you are. You don't care about going to see a doctor even though it's free. It's yours in this new health tech ecosystem we're building out. I'm with Amy Gleason who also ran Doge, you know, helping to to to roll this all out. We're making it easier for every tech company to participate. 600 companies have signed a pledge agreeing to interoperability and data transparency and to build these tools for the American people to be able to use them. Now, once I a deputize you to be better equipped to take care of yourself, you change the system. Because when you ask a doctor a question, the first time you're the only patient, they don't pay attention. The second patient who asks the same question, we change. As a physician, I'm telling you, it helps us to have patients pushing us to pay attention to, for example, ambient collection of information in the doctor's office. So, I get a medical report on what you told me. Why? Because 50% of what a doctor tells the patient is forgotten before the patient leaves the office. So, when your kid asks you, hey, what happened with the doctor? You don't remember. You're nervous. You're anxious. The doctor spoke quickly. Use big words. Break all that down. And all of a sudden, information gets flowing easily. Now you've got a lot more stakeholders. And who's the ultimate stakeholder? The patient. So the medical records who historically have been hijacked by medical record companies

</details>

**主持人**: 而且被隐藏了。

**主持人**: 比如你如何才能拿到它们？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: like how do you ever get them?

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 是的。所有这些公司现在都说：“好吧，我们明白了。”这又回到了总统。他在这方面不是开玩笑的。当他告诉你他希望你分享数据时，你知道如果你不处理这个问题，他就会来找你麻烦。所以他们都来了，说：“好吧，我们现在不是在开玩笑。”制药公司在我们谈判最惠国待遇时。你知道当我们挑战他们，说：“你们对同样的产品收取高出好几倍的价格。”他们说什么？他们说：“好吧，我们知道有一天你会来敲门。”我们知道他们会。所以，我们实际上认为总统会做些什么，所以我们准备谈判。你不想放弃那种权力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: Yeah. And all those companies now are saying, "All right, we get the joke." And this is again back to the president. He's not fooling around in this stuff. When he tells you he wants you to share data, you know he's going to come after your ass if you don't deal with this problem. And so they've all come and all right, you know, we're not on the joke now. The pharma companies when we're negotiating most favored nation. You know what they said when we challenged them and said, "You're you're charging several times more for the same products." They said, "All right, well, we knew one day you'd come knocking." We knew they do. So, and we actually think the president would do something to us, so we're going to negotiate. And you don't want to throw away that power.

</details>

**主持人**: 你知道，不要乞求宽恕，要推动行动。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You know, don't beg for forgiveness. Push for action. Yeah.

**Dr. Oz**: 你知道，去把事情搞定。如果搞不定，也没关系。你会有更多机会。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: You know, go make things happen. And if they don't work out, fine. You you you'll get more more bites at the apple.

**David Saxs**: 就在那个承诺点上，因为我有幸参加了白宫的那次活动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Just on that point about the pledge because I got to attend that event at the White House.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 你组织了它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: You organized it.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 嗯，别谦虚。我的意思是，那会有点过誉了，但说实话，那是你和**Amy Gleason**以及**肯尼迪部长**。你们不知何故邀请了我，但这真的很有趣，因为这是我作为门外汉的理解，那就是法律赋予我们拥有自己医疗记录的权利，但在实践中，我们却拿不到它们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Well, don't be modest. I mean, that's going to be a little bit too much credit, but it was honestly it was you and Amy Gleason and Secretary Kennedy and you guys just happened to invite me for some reason, but it was it was really interesting cuz so this is my kind of layman's understanding of it, which is the law gives us the right to our own medical records, but in practice, we don't get them.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: **HIPAA**（健康保险流通与责任法案）规定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: HIPPA regulated.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 嗯，那是因为存储健康记录的公司，是的，它们以专有格式存储，我们不知道如何获取这些数据，即使获取了也不知道该怎么办。所以关键是让这些健康记录共享给所有我们可能想使用的其他医疗公司。因此，这个承诺的力量在于让这600家公司达成协议。但我认为**AI**是这里的神奇粘合剂，因为**AI**非常擅长读取不同格式的数据并进行翻译。所以你不再需要一个完美的API。你只需导入非结构化数据，现在它就能正常工作了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Well, it's it's because the the companies that store the health records Yeah. do it in proprietary formats and we don't really know how to get that data and what would we do with it even if we did. So the key is to get those health records shared to all the other medical companies in the space that we might want to use. Hence the power of the pledge get these 600 companies agreeing. But I think that AI is kind of the magic glue here because AI is so good at reading data from different formats and translating it. So you don't need like a perfect API anymore. You just get the unstructured data, dump it in, and now it just works.

</details>

**主持人**: 这正是我们开始看到的。我正在把我的**Eight Sleep**数据、我的**Whoop**数据、我的血液检测结果，全部输入到四个主要的平台中，询问它们。我拍下我每一种补充剂或饮料的照片。这会产生什么影响？这会对睡眠产生什么影响？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Which is what we're starting to see. I'm taking my eight sleep data, my Whoop data, my blood panels, and I'm putting it into all four of the major ones, asking it. I take pictures of every one of my supplements or drinks. What impact will this have? Which impact will this have on sleeping?

</details>

**David Saxs**: 我认为这是一个巨大的胜利。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: I think that's like this gigantic win.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。你能够实现法律赋予你的拥有自己医疗数据的承诺，但要以一种可用的格式获取它，现在你可以再次使用聊天界面来理解它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. you being able to realize the promise that the law gives you to actually own your own medical data, but to get it in a usable format that now you can use again a chat interface to understand it.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 这是技术性的模糊化。我们直说吧。他们总是试图利用这些专有格式来获得技术优势，并在他们的业务周围建立护城河。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: It's technological obscurification. Let's call it what it is. They're trying to use these proprietary formats always to get a technological advantage and to have a moat around their business.

</details>

**主持人**: **AI**只是解码了这些，使其可用，现在你就可以与之互动了。我能再举一个例子吗？所以，医生。你提到了**民主化**。你和我都曾讨论过某些州实际上正在试图禁止在治疗中使用**AI**。我认为你对我提出的观点是，你知道，全国各地有很多地方，比如农村地区，那里没有精神科医生，也没有精神科护理。所以至少**AI**提供了一个基本的服务水平。它的第一个版本可能不完美。可能有一些**幻觉**，但它每年都在变得越来越好。如果你禁止它，那么很多人就什么都没有了，对吗？我的意思是，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: AI just decodes that and makes it usable and now you can you can interact with it. Can can I bring up one other example? So, Dr. You mentioned democratization. And you and I have had a conversation about certain states are actually trying to ban the use of AI to be used in therapy. And I think the point you made to me is you know what there's a lot of places all over the country like rural areas where there aren't psychiatrists or there isn't psychiatric care. So at least AI provides a baseline level of service. It version one may not have been perfect. There may have been some hallucination but it is getting better and better every year. If you ban it, then a lot of people are just going to have nothing, right? I mean,

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 说得太好了。让我们来稍微展开一下，但我想在高层次上说，**AI**正在走向你附近的社区。你无法阻止它。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: beautifully stated. Let's just go over let's unwrap that a little bit, but I'd be just at a high level say AI is coming to a neighborhood near you. You're not stopping it. Yeah.

**主持人**: 所以，它会存在，病人会使用它。所以，你必须参与其中，而不是逃避它。你知道，嗯，你知道，我们不能在这个问题上把头埋在沙子里。有些事情你可以拖延，但我鼓励每个州长全力以赴，但要以正确的方式去做。让专业人士发挥他们的最大能力。我们为什么不更好地利用药剂师呢？大概有7万名药剂师，对吧？这样想：几乎所有美国人，95%的人都住在离药店五英里以内。他们通常不住在离医院五英里以内。所以，我们在很多方面都无法获得医疗服务。如果我们只是利用**AI**，让药剂师和医生、全科医生发挥更高的水平，这本身就值得这个机会。所以，我甚至不是说完全主张让一个我们无法控制的**AI代理**来做。也许，你知道，其他国家会参与其中。在非常实际的层面上，我们没有足够的从业人员。根本没有足够的人来照顾美国农村地区。6000万生活在美国农村地区的美国人无法获得心理健康服务。我们的退伍军人自杀率高得惊人，比我们在战争中损失的还要多，因为他们无法获得心理健康服务。他们中的许多人确实生活在美国农村地区。所以，如果我们要解决这些耗时的问题，你不会让公园大道的精神科医生去行医。每小时800美元。

**主持人**: So, it's going to be there and patients are going to use it. And so, you have to engage it running from it. You know, uh, you know, we we we cannot stick our head in the sand on this one. There's other things you can sort of delay, but I I've encouraged every governor go full boore at this, but do it in the right way. Allow professionals to function at the height of their lensure. Why don't we use pharmacists better? There's probably 70,000 pharmacists, right? And think about this way. Almost all Americans, 95% live within five miles of a pharmacy. There's they don't live near five, you know, near a hospital usually. So, we don't have access to care in many ways. If we just took AI and allowed pharmacists and doctors, GPS to function at a higher level, it itself would be worth the opportunity. So, I'm not even saying advocate at all to a to a to an AI agent that doesn't really understand you. we can't control. Maybe, you know, some other country gets involved in it. At its very practical level, we do not have enough practitioners. There just aren't enough people to take care of rural America. 60 million Americans living in rural America don't have access to mental health services. Our vets commit suicide at a crazy high rate, more than we lose in war because they don't have access to mental health services. Many of them do live in rural America. And so, if we're going to fix those kinds of problems, which are timeconuming, you're not going to get Park Avenue psychiatrists to go practice medicine. $800 an hour

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 在阿拉斯加北坡，在冬天，每小时800美元。这根本不可能发生。所以，我们国家刚刚投入的这500亿美元投资，这笔钱是农村医疗保健和工薪家庭减税立法的一部分，那是总统推动的，国会也支持了。500亿美元，通过我们机构对农村医疗保健进行的有史以来最大的一笔投资，在日历年结束前就分配出去了。所有州长都拿到了这笔钱，我们要求他们在社区中发挥作用。你知道，你的社区，他们几乎都带回了一些**AI**元素。他们都知道，要想真正在美国农村地区获得医疗保健，你必须**调整系统规模**。调整系统规模意味着，你知道，医院将以不同的方式运作。医生将以不同的方式相互合作。但**AI**是如此多事情的核心要素。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: at $800 bucks an hour in the North Slope of of Alaska in the winter. It's just not going to happen. And so this $50 billion investment that we as a country just made just just I the money was part of the rural health the the working families tax uh cut legislation uh that the president pushed through and Congress got behind. $50 billion the largest investment ever made in rural healthcare through our agency was given up by the end of the calendar year. All the governors have the money and we charge them to make a difference in their communities. You know, your communities, they almost all came back with some AI element. They all know to really be able to get healthcare in rural America, you've got to rightsize the system. Right sizing the system means, you know, you have hospitals going to work out differently. Doctors will work differently with each other. But AI is the core element of so much

</details>

**David Saxs**: 这些微型医院就像人们在自己家后院建造**ADU**（附属住宅单元），以获得额外的公寓给爷爷奶奶住，或者作为**Airbnb**。我的理解是，有很多初创公司正在开发类似的微型医院，一个房间里有中央服务，也许还有一个护士执业医师，他们更容易找到。然后你可以通过**远程医疗**，将医疗服务带到这些地区，而无需建造一个巨大的医院，这也是一个胜利。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: and these micro hospitals just like people are putting ADU units in the back of their homes to get an extra, you know, apartment for grandma and grandpa or as an Airbnb. My understanding is there's a bunch of startups working on the equivalent building a micro hospital a room with the central services perhaps a nurse practitioner uh who there's more available and then you tele medicine in just bringing the medicine to those areas without having to build a giant hospital is also a win yeah

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 我认为**微型诊所**是提供顶级医疗服务的巨大机会，但这超出了范围。我们有**AI**支持的机器人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: the micro clinics I think a huge opportunity to provide top tier care but this goes beyond that we have AI supported robots

</details>

**David Saxs**: 它们将在阿拉巴马州的一些地方进行超声检查，那里没有妇产科医生，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: that are going to be doing ultrasounds in parts of Alabama where there are no OBS, right?

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 我们有无人机向阿拉斯加北坡运送处方药，那里没有道路。我们有自动售货机可以智能分发药物。顺便说一句，这在其他国家正在发生。所以，我们希望这在美国发生。为什么不利用这个机会，通过**农村健康转型基金**的500亿美元巨额资金流入，开始在国家的基础组成部分——农村地区做一些创新工作呢？这些价值观会影响到我们其他人。我还认为各州现在正在以不同的方式相互交流。现在，既然有了可以用来改变世界的资金，他们开始以非常不同的方式谈论**AI**和技术。现在，它不再是稀疏的研究。我们生活在一个富足的世界。如果我们正确使用**AI**，它会使这个世界更加富足。这不会在今天发生，但我们相信，到本届政府完成这项工作时，我们将极大地改变美国人在医疗保健系统中处理信息的方式。其中一些只是**基本操作**，就像你说的，让医疗记录公司不要**数据封锁**。其中一些是强制**健康信息系统**以更舒适、更优雅、更公平的价格共享数据。其中一部分是我们向系统投入资金，以正确的方式播种。嗯，但最重要的是要让外出变得安全。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: We have drones delivering uh prescription medications to the North Slope of uh of Alaska, where there are no roads, we have you have vending machines that can dispense smart dispensing of medications. By the way, this is happening in other countries. So, we want this to take place in America. Why not take advantage of of an opportunity through with a huge massive inflow of money which the rural health transformation fund does $50 billion to start to do some innovative work in rural parts of the country which are the the foundational element of who we are as a nation. Those values ripple up to the rest of us. I also think that states now are talking to each other differently. Now now that you got money that's out there that can be used to change the world. They start talking about AI and technology generally very differently. Now, it's not a it's it's it's not a sparse research. We live in a world of abundance. And AI makes it that much more abundant if we use it correctly. And it's not going to happen today, but we believe by the time the administration has completed this work, we will have dramatically changed the face of how Americans work with information in the health care system. Some of it's just blocking and tackling, as you said, make medical record companies, not data block. Some of it's forcing uh health information systems to share data more comfortably and elegantly at a at a fair price. And part of it's us putting money into the system. seeding it the right way. Um but the most important thing is to make it safe to go outside.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Yeah.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 我们希望让人们能够舒适地承担财务风险，投资于这些领域。这就是为什么600家公司已经投资了。每一家主要的**AI**公司，每一家主要的**基础技术公司**，以及我承诺的许多外科医生，他们都蜂拥而入。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: We want to make it comfortable to take financial risk to invest in these areas. That's why 600 companies have invested. Every major AI company, every major foundational technology company, but all a bunch of these surgeons that I that I promised, they're all rushing in.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 企业家一直不愿承担风险去开发新产品和服务的三个领域是：教育、住房、医疗保健。这些也恰好是受政府监管最多、控制最多的领域。所以，如果你能让他们获得机会并加快速度，它就会奏效。我们在这方面唯一做过的投资是直接面向消费者的，因为我们知道通过政府，这些公司没有足够的跑道来达到彼岸。让我问你关于...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: The three places entrepreneurs have been reticent to uh take on uh to build new products and services. Education, housing, healthcare. These also happen to be the ones most regulated, most controlled by the government. So to the extent you can give them access and make it go faster, it's going to work. The only investments we've ever made in those spaces are ones that go direct to consumer because we know going through the government, there's just not enough runway for those companies to get to the other side. Let me ask you about

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 我们欢迎合作。我在这里必须强调这一点。我们希望与行业合作。我们相信私营部门会提出更好的想法。来和我们一起工作吧。我们也在寻找人才，我们有九名工程师。当我们进来时，整个**CMS**只有九名工程师，我们的**Cobalt**基础设施建于70年代，我们没有工程师。

### 减肥神药与公共健康

**主持人**: 天哪，我们可以永远谈论欺诈。但我想问你关于这种**神奇药物**。四年前，我听我的朋友**Tim Ferris**和**Kevin Rose**，他们是生物黑客，总是走在这些事情的前沿。**Kevin**身材很好，他想减掉一些内脏脂肪。他听说了一种糖尿病药物**Ozempic**（奥美普林），他想试一试。他把注射笔调到最高，吐了，又调低，减掉了内脏脂肪。我听说了，当时我40岁，213磅。我去看医生。他说：“我不知道你在说什么。你没有糖尿病，但你很胖。”我想他说，“你这个胖混蛋。”我想我说了那句话。我每年只增加了两三磅，持续了20年。我以前是马拉松运动员。我以前是165、170磅。所以现在172磅，现在就像羚羊一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: God, we could go on about fraud for forever. But I want to ask you about this wonder drug. Four years ago, I was listening to my friend uh Tim Ferris and Kevin Rose who are biohackers and they're always on the edge of this stuff and he wanted to lose some visceral fat. Kevin was in great shape and he heard about this diabetes drug OMIC and that he was going to give it a shot. He dialed the pen all the way up, puked, dialed it back down, lost his visceral fat. I heard that I was like 40. I was 213 pounds at the time. Went to my doctor. He said, "I have no idea what you're talking about. You're not diabetic, but you are fat." And I think he said, "You're a fat bastard." I think I said that. And I had just gained like two or three pounds a year for 20 years. And I used to be a marathon runner. I used to be 165, 170 lbs. So now 172 gazelle right now by the way.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 嗯，我也增加了一点肌肉。谢谢你，**奥兹医生**。你看起来也很棒。嗯，但这是一种**奇迹药物**。在我看来，现在理论上已经有数千万美国人体验过它了。它将以药丸的形式出现。**末日四骑士**：心脏病。

**Dr. Oz**: Well I add a little muscle too. Thank you Dr. O. You look great too. Um but this is a miracle drug. This in my mind we now have theoretically tens of millions of Americans have experienced it. It's going to be in pill format. The the four uh horsemen of the apocalypse, heart disease,

**主持人**: 肾衰竭、肝病、痴呆症。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: kidney failure, liver disease, dementia.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 痴呆症。这四种都受到肥胖的影响。这些**GLP-1**类药物似乎正在影响它们。我当时想，你知道吗？如果**特朗普总统**只是宣布全国范围内任何人都可以获得这种药物，如果他们想要的话，我想他会赢得选举。他反正赢了。嗯，你认为强制所有美国人都能获得这种减肥药怎么样？那会是...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: Dementia. These are all four of four are impacted by obesity. and these GOP ones seem to be impacting them. I was like, you know what? If Trump just President Trump just gave a national anybody can get this drug if they want it, I think he'd win the election. He won anyway. Um, what do you think about a mandate to make it available to make the fat drug available for all Americans? Would that be

</details>

**主持人**: 所以，我很高兴你今天来上班了。所以，嗯，大约两个月前，在椭圆形办公室，总统基本上就是这样做的。他说我们将把这些药物的价格，现在对许多美国人来说高得令人望而却步，现金支付1200美元。这太疯狂了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So, I'm glad you came to work today. So, uh, about two months ago in the Oval Office, the president basically did that. He said that we're going to take the prices of these drugs, which are now prohibitively high for many Americans, $1,200 cash pay. It's

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 疯狂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: crazy.

</details>

**主持人**: 起始价格将在200美元左右。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It's going to be a starting price of around $200.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 容易。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: Easy.

</details>

**主持人**: 而且，嗯，药丸是150美元，药丸将会上市。嗯，第一批**FDA**批准的药丸将于本月开始上市。嗯，所以我们相信以这个价格。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And u with the pills, it's $150 and the pills will come out. Uh the first FDA approved pills will start this month. Um and so we believe at that price

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 天。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: day

</details>

**主持人**: 因为仔细想想。没错。基本上你每天喝一杯咖啡。以这个价格，我们将在两年内为美国纳税人省钱。它将为我们节省大量资金，通过减少高血压、糖尿病以及你提到的**末日四骑士**等下游疾病，我们将节省我们花费在这些由肥胖引起的慢性疾病上的医疗费用的一半以上。所以，无论是直接还是间接，因为你超重伤了膝盖，或者你得了自身免疫问题，甚至癌症也与肥胖有关，因为你处于代谢活跃状态。所有这些都将急剧下降。我们有相当好的内部建模数据。所以我们与两家主要公司**Novo Nordisk**（诺和诺德）和**Eli Lilly**（礼来）达成了这些价格协议。我们下周将推出。我不知道这个播客何时播出，但下周将推出**Trump RX**，提供这些产品，这样你就可以以完全负担得起的价格现金支付。好消息是，每个**Medicare**患者只需支付50美元的共同支付。每个**Medicaid**患者免费获得。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: because think carefully. That's right. It's a basically you get coffee a day. At that price, we will within two years return money to the American taxpayer. It's going to save us so much money from reducing hypertension, diabetes, and the downstream illnesses, the four horsemen of the apocalypse that you mentioned that we will save money that we spend over half the money we I believe within health care on these chronic illnesses driven by obesity. And so either directly or indirectly because you hurt your knees because you're overweight or you get autoimmune problems or even cancer is linked to obesity because you have a metabolically active state. All of these are going to drop precipitously. We have pretty good data on this from an internal modeling. So we agreed to those prices with the two major companies Novo Nordisk and Eli Liy. We will launch next week. I don't know when this podcast airs but launch next week Trump RX with those products so you can cash pay at a price that is completely affordable. And here's the good news. Every Medicare patient gets it for $50 co-pay. Every Medicaid patient gets it for nothing.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 太棒了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: Amazing.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以那些最需要它的人，那些最脆弱的人，这就是当人们说总统不想保护**Medicaid**，他不爱惜**Medicare**时，这让我抓狂，因为他为服务不足的美国人所做的事情比任何其他总统都多。让肥胖流行病存在的美国人，服务不足的美国人，那些脆弱的**Medicaid**美国人，免费获得这些药物。这真正地**民主化**了减肥问题，因为现在减肥药的头号邮政编码是什么？头号邮政编码是曼哈顿上东区。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So the people who need it the most, the folks that are most vulnerable, this is what it when people say the president doesn't want to protect Medicaid, he doesn't love and cherish Medicare. It drives me bonkers because he's doing more for underserved Americans than any other president ever has. Giving Americans where the obesity epidemic lives, underserved Americans, you vulnerable Americans who are on Medicaid access to these drugs for no out-of-pocket costs. truly democratizes the weight loss issues because right now what's the number one zip code for weight loss drugs. Number one zip code upper east side of Manhattan.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 我正要说，肯定是曼哈顿或洛杉矶。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Okay.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 因为人们负担得起，或者...

<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Cuz people can afford it or

**主持人**: 因为他们爱慕虚荣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: because they're vain.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 他们爱慕虚荣。他们想在女儿婚礼前减掉两磅，而且他们负担得起。1200美元，一个大概的数字。是的。没错。但对于一个不赚钱的人来说，1200美元。你不会去服用这种药，而他们是那些早逝的人。美国农村地区，我再回到他们那里，弱势群体的预期寿命比你们在同一个国家短9年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: They're vain. They want to lose two pounds for their daughter's wedding and they can afford it. $1,200 a rounding area. Yeah. Right. But $1,200 for someone that's not making money. You're not you're just not going to take the drug and they're the ones that die early. The life expectancy in rural America, I'll go back to them in vulnerable populations 9 years shorter than yours in the same country.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 这真是出人意料。这告诉我们未来的医学会发生什么？因为**GLP-1**类药物，它的发展历程有多长？然后上市，然后你知道，这种**超说明书使用**从糖尿病患者开始。那是什么？那是什么？这如何启发你我们如何在未来产生更大的影响？我们如何像**特朗普总统**那样，发现并实施另一个**GLP-1**类药物？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: It's something that came out of left field. What does that tell us about what's going to happen in medicine going forward? Because GLPS, how long of a journey has that been and then getting to market and then you know this off label use starting with people with diabetes. What is that? What is that? How does that inform you of how we can make even more impact in the future? How do we make another GLP-1 like discovery and implement it the way President Trump has?

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，你知道，这种药物实际上来自一种有毒的化学物质，一种毒液，它被破译并发现对身体食欲系统中的一些核心细胞有影响，这对于我们是谁来说是如此基础，以至于很难**破解食欲**。但**GLP-1**类药物只是冰山一角。我们有越来越多复杂的方法来解决的不仅是食欲，还有成瘾，**GLP-1**类药物能降低成瘾行为。所以新药将在这方面更有效。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Well, this, you know, the drug actually came, it's a poisonous uh chemical, a venom actually, that was uh deciphered and found to have an impact on some of these core cells in the in the the appetite system of the body, which is so fundamental to who we are that it's very hard to hack the appetite. But GLP-1s are just the tip of the iceberg. There are more and more sophisticated ways for us to be able to address not just appetite but addiction, addictive behavior drops at GLP-1s. So the newer drugs are going to be even more effective at that.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: **Red True Tide**就是其中之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: Red True Tide is the one you

</details>

**主持人**: 举个例子，**Red Tide**。但我想说的另一件事是，**剂型**很重要。给某人注射，在温暖的天气下会变质，浪费很多，而且你不知道确切的剂量。药丸使其像大多数其他药物一样，现在药物的价格也低得多。所以我们更容易大规模地将其提供给美国人民。所以它确实让我们超越了今天的问题，这是我们政府的一个重要主题。如果你们正在建设的世界没有管道，就不要费心去修理今天破裂的管道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: for example, Red Tide. But the other thing I would say is the form factor matters in sending someone an injection that's that goes bad in the warm weather that a lot of wastage and you don't know the exact dose. the pills make it like most other drugs and now the drug the price point is much lower as well. So it's easier for us to deliver that at scale to the American people. So it does leapfrog us beyond today's problems and this is a big theme of our administration. Don't bother fixing today's broken pipes if the world you're building doesn't have pipes

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 这就是我们正在用**司美格鲁肽**（semaglutide）和**替西帕肽**（tirzepatide），也就是**礼来**的产品所做的事情。我们还在让这些公司**将生产设施迁回美国**，雇用美国工人，保持创新。这就是为什么总统不希望我们损害创新。在我们举行第一次**最惠国药品**活动的那天，我们发布了一项关于**儿童癌症**的行政命令。20个漂亮的孩子，笑容灿烂，眼睛明亮，他们本该都已不在人世。他们之所以幸存下来，是因为获得了技术，这些技术在世界其他地方并不存在，以维持他们的生命。这就是我们的目标。但我需要，如果我不谈论其他方面，那我就做得不好。我听到钟声敲响了。

**Dr. Oz**: and that's what we're doing with drugs like semagutide and interzepide which is the the lily product. We're also getting these companies to unshore their production facility hire American workers stay innovative. This is why again the president doesn't want us hurting innovation. With the same day we did the first most favored nation drug um event, we had an executive order on childhood cancer. 20 beautiful children, smiley bright eyes, all of whom all of whom should have been ghosts. They survived because technologies were afforded to them. Don't exist in other parts of the world to keep them alive. That's our goal. But I need to I'd be poorly served.

**Dr. Oz**: 当然。首先，让我来告诉你，这是一个好问题。你为什么会允许欺诈发生？根据联邦法律，如果你给病人提供福利计划，**SNAP**（补充营养援助计划）、**Medicaid**，你还必须让他们能够注册投票。所以你基本上在提供免费政府服务的同时招募选民，这可能会让你招募到不同类型的选民。比如，你没有一条法律规定，如果你去参加**NRA**（全国步枪协会）大会，嗯，为了枪支倡导者，你必须注册选民，对吧？你可以去那个活动，不注册投票。显然，他们可能会倾向于右翼。所以这里有一个问题。我们还有工会的积极作用，尤其是在加州，我们有一个大问题，因为工会似乎，这都是我从与当地人交谈中听到的，似乎参与了，例如，招募**家庭护理人员**和**个人护理服务**。我相信，提供这些**居家服务**的美国人可能比美国零售业的员工还要多。我们已经把整个就业经济转向了这些服务。风险在这里。如果你真的想了解为什么美国存在欺诈，当我给你提供你家人曾经给你的东西时，我们就会有欺诈。所以，你的家人曾经开车送你去看医生。你出院后，你的家人会带你回家，确保你得到良好的营养和照顾。你的家人会帮你把杂货搬上楼。你的家人会帮你和房东谈判合同。猜猜怎么着？**健康与人类服务部**现在为你做所有这些。你所要做的就是提出要求。在一些州，这太容易了，结果导致了严重的欺诈。我们...

**Dr. Oz**: Of course. First of all, let me just I'll tell you that's a good question. Why would you let fraud happen? It is by federal law, by federal law mandated that if you give a patient a welfare program, SNAP, uh, Medicaid, you must also give them the ability to sign up to vote. So you're basically recruiting voters at the same time you're giving them free government services which then you might actually end up recruiting a different kind of voter like you don't have a law that if you go to an NRA convention uh right for for you know gun advocates that you sign up voters right you can go to that event not get signed up to vote obviously they would be probably skewing to the right so there is an issue there we also have an active role of unions especially in California where we have a a major problem because the unions have seemed This is all what I'm hearing from talking to people on the ground seem to have gotten involved in, for example, signing up home health care workers and and personal care services. There are more Americans, I believe, providing some of these homebased services that maybe might exist in retail in America. We've shifted the entire employment economy towards some of these services. And here's the risk. If you really want to understand why we have fraud in America, when I give you things that your family used to give you, we are going to have fraud. So, your family used to drive you to the doctor's office. Your family would take you home after you got home back from the hospital to make sure you got well nourished and taken care of. Your family would carry the groceries up the stairs. Your family would negotiate your contract with the landlord. Guess what? Healthy human services does all that for you now. All you got to do is ask. And in some states, it's so easy to do that you end up with significant fraud. We

**David Saxs**: 所以，他们拦截了交易。因此，那里可能会发生**贪污**和**欺诈**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: So, they have intercepted the transaction. Therefore, that's where grift can occur and fraud.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 嗯，政府在为此买单，对吧？所以当消费者自掏腰包时，他们有自己的动力去为交易获得价值。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: Well, the government's paying for it, right? So when the consumer is paying for it out of their own pocket, they have their own incentive to get value for the transaction.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 但当政府为此买单时，谁真正有动力确保所提供的价值与金钱相符呢？是的。这就是明尼苏达州发生的事情，那里有一个亚文化。你知道，大多数被起诉的人都是索马里人。所以索马里社区意识到，嘿，天哪，没人管。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: But when the government's paying for it, who really has the incentive to make sure that value has been provided in exchange for that money? Yeah. And this is what happened in Minnesota where you had a subculture. It was prim, you know, just the mathematically most of the indictments with are with Somalians. So the Somalian community realized, hey, my goodness, no one's watching.

**主持人**: 现在有一句格言，你知道，只有傻瓜才会在医疗欺诈中被抓，因为它太容易了。如果你在**Medicare**或**Medicaid**中偷了500万美元，你只会被判18个月的监禁。我的意思是，对很多人来说，这笔交易相当划算。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Now there's an adage, you know, that only the morons get caught in healthcare fraud because it's so easy to do. And if if you get you steal $5 million uh in medic in Medicare Medicaid, you go to jail for 18 months. I mean, for many people, that's a pretty good deal.

**David Saxs**: 是的。

**David Saxs**: Yeah.

**Dr. Oz**: 解决方案是什么？肯定有非常实用、简单的解决方案。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: what's the solution? There's got to be really practical, easy solution.

</details>

**主持人**: 有，但我会分享，但让我先给你另外两个，因为你会记得这些。加州的**临终关怀**数量是七倍。**临终关怀**是为生命末期的人提供的。七倍于五、六、七年前的**临终关怀**数量。七倍。加州没有那么多人死亡。更重要的是，**临终关怀**的生存率，再次强调，它是为六个月内去世的癌症患者设计的。大多数这些**临终关怀中心**的生存率是100%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: There are, but and I'm going to share that, but let me just give you two others because you would remember these. We have seven times more hospice in California. Hospice is for people at the end of their life. Seven times more hospice than was there five, six, seven years ago. Seven times more. We don't have that many people dying in California. And more importantly, the survival rates on hospice, again, designed for cancer patients dying within six months. The survival rate for most of these hospice centers is 100%.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 等一下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Wait a second.

</details>

**主持人**: 他们不应该去**临终关怀**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: They shouldn't have gone to hospice.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Exactly.

</details>

**主持人**: 政府在为此买单吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Is the government paying for it?

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 是的。完全由政府支付。但没有人死亡，因为你不应该死。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: Yes. Completely paying for it. But no one's dying because you're not supposed to.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 政府什么时候开始支付这个费用？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: When did the government start paying for that?

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 哦，40年前。好的。它是被设计的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: Oh, 40 years ago. Okay. It was designed.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 那么在过去的七年或十年里发生了什么，欺诈行为就蔓延开来了？外国政府参与了洛杉矶的**临终关怀**？**临终关怀**是由俄罗斯亚美尼亚帮派主导的。他们是外国公民。他们飞回俄罗斯。今年早些时候，我们对这些人进行了150亿美元的大规模打击。再次强调，他们都逃脱了。另一件事是，没有人监管，因为如果你进入这些行业，就有机会赚大钱，它就变成了，我给你讲一个关于**举报人**的真实故事。再次强调，我无法证明这一点，但这是他说的。他说他，嗯，他正在建造一座美丽的豪宅。他拥有所有这些**临终关怀机构**。他是一名医生，但他是一个骗子。嗯，所以他建造了这座豪宅。水管工来了，说：“嘿，你知道，我听说你从事**临终关怀**领域。”那个人说：“是的，我在**临终关怀**领域赚了钱。”水管工说：“你知道，我有一个副业。我也拥有一家**临终关怀机构**。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: And then what happened in the last seven or 10 that the fraud just went foreign governments got involved in LA? The hospice is driven by the Russian Armenian gangs. They're foreign nationals. They fly back to Russia. We had a big $15 billion bust on these guys earlier in the year. Again, they all escape. The other thing is no one's watching because there's a opportunity if you get into these businesses to make a lot of money and it becomes I'll give you I'll just tell you a true story about uh a whistleblower. Again, I I can't prove this, but it's what he said. He said that he uh he was building a beautiful mansion. He owns all these hospices. He's a doctor, but he's a fraudster. Uh and so he built this puer house. They the plumber comes in and says, "Hey, you know, I hear you in the hospice space." The guy says, "Yeah, I made my money in hospice." that the plumber says, "You know, I've got a side hustle. I own a hospice, too."

</details>

**主持人**: 对吧？然后木匠听到了，他说：“我也是。我也在**临终关怀**行业。我们都在**临终关怀**行业。”绝对是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Right? Then the carpenter hears him and he says, "Me, too. I'm in the hospice business. We're all in the hospice business." Absolutely.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 然后那个人说：“好吧，他意识到他必须超越这些人。”所以他去了洛杉矶一家大医院，医院里的一位医生，一家非常著名的医院，大家都听说过，说：“嘿，听着。如果你每个月给我1000美元，我就会把**临终关怀病人**送到你那里。”顺便说一句，洛杉矶就是这样做的。你拿到钱，你就把病人送过去。所以那个人说：“好的，但是那些实际的住院病人呢？比如住院的人？我能得到他们吗？”他们得到了，医生说：“我不能那样做，因为事实证明，董事会的一些成员拥有**临终关怀机构**，他们喜欢让病人去他们的中心。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: So then the guy says, "Okay, well, he realized he's got to get ahead of these guys." So he goes to a a major hospital in LA and a doctor at the hospital, very prominent hospital that everyone's heard of, says, "Hey, listen. You, if you give me $1,000 a month, I'll send hospice patients to you." Which is how it's done in LA, by the way. You get paid, this you send patients over. So the guy says, "Okay, but what about the actual inpatients like the people hospitalized? Can I get them?" They got and the doctor says, "I can't do that because it turns out the members some there are some members of the board that own hospice and they like the patients to go to their centers."

</details>

**主持人**: 你看，腐败始于有组织犯罪，但如果你容忍它，它就会毒害整个系统。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You see that the corruption starts in in organized crime, but if you tolerate it, it poisons the whole system.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 这就是我们遇到更大问题的原因。那么我们正在做什么？我们有一个**反欺诈作战室**。嗯，我将暂停一些这些服务。我们不会让新人注册。嗯，我们将积极主动地停止支付**Medicaid**，嗯，如果我们能证明各州没有履行他们对美国人民的**信托责任**，因为各州管理**Medicaid**。我在**CMS**支付账单。所以，如果我们认为你没有妥善管理资金，我们将停止代表纳税人支付。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: And that's the bigger reason we've got a problem. So what are we doing? We have a fraud uh war room. Uh I'm going to put a moratorum on some of these services. We're not going to let new people sign up. Uh we're going to actively and aggressively stop paying Medicaid uh if we can prove that states are not obliging their fiduciary responsibility to the American people because states administer Medicaid. I pay the bills at CMS. So, we're going to stop paying on behalf of the taxpayer if we don't think you're taking care of the money.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 人们应该知道有**举报人法律**，你可以获得举报金额的一定比例，他们应该调查一下。事实上，现在政府中有这么多人都在传达，嘿，我们希望你向我们举报欺诈，这改变了一切。举报欺诈的人数肯定增加了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: And people should know there are whistleblower laws where you get a percentage of whatever is reported and they should look into that. And the fact that we have so many people in the administration now communicating that, hey, we want to have you report fraud to us has changed everything. The number of people reporting fraud must have gone up since

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 急剧增加。政府里的人，这可能是我觉得最有成就感的部分。许多政府工作人员是民主党人。可能大多数。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: dramatically. People in the government, this is probably, you know, the part that's most rewarding to me. Many government workers are Democrats. Probably most

</details>

**David Saxs**: 他们一遍又一遍地告诉我，他们来政府只是为了做他们的工作。他们想做正确的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: what they tell me again and again is they just came to government to do their job. They wanted to do the right thing

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 他们被告知不要做他们的工作。他们被告知不要关注欺诈，而是要关注让更多人注册。但如果你不处理欺诈，这是一个重要的信息。你将摧毁这个系统。最终，你将摧毁**Medicaid**。我们不会让这种事情在我们任期内发生。正如**休伯特·汉弗莱**所说，**Medicaid**是为了保护那些生命初期的人，也就是我们的孩子。53%的孩子出生在贫困中。我们照顾他们。那些生命暮年的人，那些老年人，对吧？我们欠他们的。每个伟大的社会都照顾最脆弱的人。我们是伟大的人民，会这样做。**休伯特·汉弗莱**说，你必须照顾那些生活在阴影中的人。我们不会让他们受到伤害。当你让有组织犯罪分子大规模窃取联邦政府的钱时，你就是在扼杀这些项目。我们现在有太多孩子被虚假地诊断为**自闭症**，以至于真正的自闭症儿童无法获得医疗服务。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: and and they were told not to do their job. They were told not to focus on the fraud, to focus on getting more people signed up. But if you don't take care of the fraud, this is an important message. You will kill the system. Eventually, you will destroy Medicaid. And I'm not going to let that happen on our watch. Medicaid, as Hubert Humphrey said, is there to protect those at the dawn of life, which are our children. 53% of kids are born into poverty. We take care of them. Those at the twilight of life, those are the seniors, right? We owe it to them. Every great society takes care of the most vulnerable. We're great people will do that. And he Hubert Humphrey said you got to take care of those living in the shadows. We are not going to let them get hurt. When you let organized criminal elements steal at scale from the federal government, you are killing those programs. We now have so many kids signed up falsely for autism that the kids with autism aren't getting access to care.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 是的。这真是令人沮丧。和一些千禧一代、Z世代的年轻父母交谈过，他们去工作。他们有两份工作。他们很想有**儿童保育**，但**儿童保育**的资金被盗了。因此，他们无法获得这些服务。同样的事情正在整个系统中发生。我认为这可能是美国的一个决定性时刻，因为另一方面，我们有一些社会主义者、疯狂的共产主义者在管理这些城市，他们想**没收人们的资产**，想在解决欺诈之前**加税**。这就像把水倒进一个漏水的桶里。嗯，你正在谈论加州。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Yeah. This is the incredibly frustrating thing. Having talked to some young parents who are millennials, Gen Z, they're going to work. They got two jobs. They would love to have child care, but the child care dollars are being stolen. Therefore, they can't access them. And the same thing's happening across the system. I think this could be just such a defining moment for America because on the other side, we have socialists, lunatic communists running some of these cities who want to seize people's assets, want to raise taxes before fixing fraud. This is like pouring water into a a leaky bucket. Well, you're talking about California

**主持人**: 和纽约。

### 加州医疗欺诈与移民问题

**David Saxs**: 是的。我忍不住注意到**加文·纽森**（Gavin Newsome）昨天抵达达沃斯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Yeah. And I couldn't help but notice that Gavin Newsome arrived here at Davos yesterday.

**David Saxs**: 是的。他鼓励欧洲领导人对抗**特朗普总统**，这对于一个州长来说，来这里做这种事很奇怪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Yeah. He was encouraging European leaders to defy President Trump, which is a weird thing for a governor to come here to

**主持人**: 但我认为，老实说，这都是一种**干扰**，因为加州现在真正发生的事情是，每个人都知道那里存在大规模欺诈。你在网上看到那张图片，那是一座冰山。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: but I think honestly it's all a distraction because the the real thing happening in California right now is everybody knows there's massive fraud there you see that image on the internet where it's an iceberg and

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 冰山一角是明尼苏达州，但加州是世界第四大经济体，所以我们知道那里存在大规模欺诈。我认为**纽森**也知道那里存在大规模欺诈，这就是他否决**审计**的原因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: the tip is Minnesota but California is the fourth largest economy in the world so we know there's massive fraud I think Newsome knows there's massive fraud too that's that's why he's vetoed

**David Saxs**: 审计。

**Dr. Oz**: 否决审计。没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: veto audits Right.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 谁会否决审计？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Who would veto an audit?

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 不想被抓的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: Someone doesn't want to get caught.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 罪犯。罪犯会否决它。我不是说他是罪犯，但是...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: A criminal. A criminal would veto it. I'm not saying he's a criminal, but

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 不，这对于政府开支来说，就像禁止**选民身份识别**对于选举一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: No, this is to government spending what the ban on voter ID is to elections.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 你为什么不这样做？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Why wouldn't

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 你只做那个？你禁止了有助于你发现欺诈的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: you only do that? You you you're banning the thing that helps you catch the fraud.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Yeah.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 那么你为什么要这样做，除非你希望欺诈发生？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: So why would you ever do that unless you want the fraud to happen?

</details>

**David Saxs**: 没错。是的。它仍然...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Exactly. It's it's Yeah. It's still

</details>

**主持人**: 现在，甚至...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: now and now even

</details>

**David Saxs**: 像我们这里说的，分散注意力。但加州的预算是3500亿美元，是迄今为止最大的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: distraati as we say here. But California the budget's $350 billion by far the biggest.

</details>

**主持人**: 在过去十年里翻了一番。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It has doubled in the last decade

</details>

**David Saxs**: 而且人均是三倍。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: and it's like three times per capita

</details>

**主持人**: 通货膨胀率的两倍半。好的。他们仍然面临巨大的赤字。这就是为什么他们现在通过这项拟议的**资产没收**，将所有**就业创造者**赶出该州。太疯狂了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: two and a half times the inflation rate. Okay. And they're still running a huge deficit. And that's why they're now driving all the job creators out of the state with this proposed asset seizure. Wild.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 如果他们只是严厉打击欺诈，他们的预算就不会出现这个漏洞。仅洛杉矶县，仅在**临终关怀**和**家庭医疗保健**方面，我们认为大约是35亿美元。仅在这两个项目在一个城市中，可能占美国所有**家庭医疗保健**开支的10%。所以，有很多事情可以做来改善这个系统，这将恢复信心。当州长不愿意履行职责时，这确实让人们认为，听着，当聪明人不作为时，那不是偶然的，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: If they just clamp down on the fraud, they wouldn't have this hole in their budget. Just LA County alone, just in hospice and home health care, we believe it's about three and a half billion dollars. Just in those two programs in one city, there's probably 10% of all home healthcare expense in America is in LA. So there's so much to do to improve the system that would restore confidence. And when you have governors who are unwilling to do their job, and it does make people think that listen, when smart people don't do things, it's not an accident. right?

</details>

**David Saxs**: 他们不做这些事情，是因为他们有**不可告人的动机**，这些动机对你来说不透明，或者他们认为你不够聪明，无法弄清楚。我们必须问这些问题。这位总统不会容忍，但美国人民也不应该容忍。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: They're not doing these things because they have ulterior motives that either aren't transparent to you or they think you're not smart enough to figure out. We had to ask those questions. This president is not going to tolerated, but the American people shouldn't either.

</details>

**主持人**: 我们经历了一个有趣的时刻。嗯，我们的朋友**埃隆·马斯克**（Elon Musk）在他收购**Twitter**（现在的**X**）后，曾要求我们去看看账单，试图弄清楚这家公司是如何以一种似乎不可能的程度**亏损现金**的。其中一件事是，他们刚刚订阅了大量的软件，你知道，基本上是订阅服务。嗯，首席财务官进来了，审计师进来了，我们都在努力弄清楚，**埃隆**说**Twitter**和**埃隆**说，嗯...

<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 但你的意思是，看，当没有人管理商店时，坏事就会发生。当几十年来没有人管理商店，而且政府还在为此买单时，你甚至没有私营部门的利润动机来提高效率。那么想想欺诈是如何**扩散**的。它一定是...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: But your point is, look, when when no one is minding the store, bad things are going to happen. And when no one has minded the store for decades and the government's paying for it, you don't even have that private sector profit motive to basically be efficient. Then think about how the fraud just metastasizes. It's got to be

**主持人**: 只需要一个带着摄像机的**YouTuber**实际出现。是的。

**David Saxs**: And that's one program in one state. And these aren't low lives doing this. The lives are involved obviously, but these are politically connected groups.

</details>

**主持人**: 精密的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Sophisticated.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 是的。这就是我强调这些有时是政府、外国政府支持的努力的原因，但做这些事情的人当然往往是**外国公民**。我们正在被利用，因为我们就像一头**大河马**。你知道，你只需要一个**受益人号码**就能渗透**Medicare**和**Medicaid**。他们可以购买这些号码，然后你就可以开始行动了。所以，解决方案，我不是说它们很简单，但它们绝对可行，但你必须对你的领导人有所期望。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Yeah. And that's why I'm emphasizing these are government, foreign governmentbacked efforts at times, but certainly the people doing them are often foreign nationals. And we are being taken advantage of because we're like a big hippopotamus. You know, all you need to penetrate Medicare and Medicaid is a beneficiary number. they can buy those and you're off to the races. So, the solutions are I'm not claiming they're simple, but they're eminently doable, but you have to expect it of your leaders.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 这里会有一些**低垂的果实**。我可以告诉你，你切断付款，然后非常简单地说，嘿，我们已经切断付款了。你所要做的就是签署这份证明你提供了服务的声明，我希望你附上你的驾驶执照和护照，嗯，顺便说一句，你被随机选中来办公室。我们想听听你正在做的一切，并加入**Zoom**会议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: There's going to be some low hanging fruit here. I can tell you you cutting off payments and saying very simply, hey, we've cut off payments. All you have to do is sign this attestation that you delivered the service and I would like you to attach your driver's license and passport to it and um by the way, you've been randomly selected to come into the office. We want to hear all about what you're doing and jump on a Zoom call.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 没错。所以，你是说取消信用卡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Right. So, you're saying cancel the credit cards.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: Yeah.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 然后...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: And then

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 然后让他们重新开户或者告诉你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: and just let them then reopen the account or tell you.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 是的。进来。是的。我们只是想重新核实正在发生的事情。字面上是...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Yeah. Come in. Yeah. We just want to reverify what's going on. Literally

</details>

**主持人**: **零基预算**。不是说项目结束了。这就是**埃隆**在做**Doge**时发现的，这些付款每年都是**自动续费**的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: zero baseline budgeting. Not saying the program is over. And that's the thing that that I think Elon found when he was doing Doge is these payments were just on recurring autopay every year.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 自动续费等于...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Autopay equals

</details>

**主持人**: 没有代码解释钱去了哪里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: with no with no code explaining what the money was going to.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 自动续费就等于欺诈。你只需要知道这一点。如果你看看一些伟大的，我的意思是，如果你想谈谈**莉娜·汗**（Lena Khan）做的一些好事，我反对其中大约80%。她做得非常好的一件事是，她说如果你注册了一项服务，你必须能够以你注册的相同方式取消它。所以报纸，这些**美德的堡垒**，你会订阅《华尔街日报》。你可能也有过这种经历。你试图取消它。他们会说给我们打电话，然后你会在电话上等一个小时，只是想取消它。我问那个女人，我说：“呃，嘿，我能问你一个简单的问题吗，嗯，我为什么不能在线取消？”他们说：“哦，嗯，因为欺诈。”我说：“但是你通过网站收了我的钱，所以欺诈实际上会发生在那里。”她说：“是的，这有点道理，但我只是一个接线员，**Calacanis先生**。”他们说：“好的，没关系。”但这是相同的概念，那就是如果你想要钱，嘿，你为什么不来办公室，我们很想听听项目进展如何。我们这里有你的支票。亲自来取。想听听。嗯，你能拍一张你提供的服务的照片吗？只需拍一张你提供的服务的照片，然后发送过来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Autopay equals from that. That's all you have to know. And if you look at like some of the great I mean if you want to talk about like some of the good stuff Lena Khan did and I was opposed to about 80% of it. One of the things she did that was really well was she said if you sign up for a service you have to be able to cancel it the same way you signed up. So newspapers these bastions of virtue you'd sign up for Wall Street Journal. You probably have had this experience. You try to cancel it. They're like give us a call and then they you're on the phone for an hour just want to cancel it. And I asked the woman, I said, "Uh, hey, can I ask you just a simple question, um, why can't I just cancel online?" They're like, "Oh, well, because of fraud." I'm like, "But you took my money through the website, so that's where the fraud would actually occur." She's like, "Yeah, that kind of makes sense, but I'm just an operator, Mr. Calican." They said, "Okay, fine." But that this is the same concept, which is if you want the money, hey, why don't you come into the office and we'd love to hear how the program's going. We got your check right here. Come pick it up in person. Want to hear about it. And uh can you just take a picture of the service you provided? Just taking a picture of the service you provided and then send it in.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: Yeah.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 这有什么难的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: How is this hard?

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 就像你说的，你如何为自己辩护？加州已经拥有全国最高的税率之一。现在你却在争取更多的税收，新颖的税收，前所未见的税收。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: And like you said, how do you argue for you? California already has some of the highest tax rates in the nation. And now you're arguing for more taxes, novel taxes, taxes that no one's ever seen.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 违宪的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Unconstitutional.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 可能违宪。而且需要一个庞大的新执法机制。在你做这些之前，你甚至还没有把系统中明显的欺诈清除掉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: Unconstitutional probably. And will require a massive new enforcement mechanism. Before you do that, you haven't even rung the obvious fraud out of the system.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 是的。听着，我们最大的盟友是**州审计员**。我见了明尼苏达州的**州审计员**。她坦言，你知道，她一直试图让这件事引起关注。嗯，只是人们不想听。我与**健康与人类服务部**内部的人交谈。你被推来推去。嗯，一名女性因为提出存在欺诈的现实而被护送出大楼。这发生了好几年。最终，如果你有道德，你就会离开，否则你就会保持沉默，因为你不想被解雇。你创造了一个如此恶劣的环境，让任何人都不敢说实话。这让我想起我的一个朋友，他现在是亿万富翁。**托马斯·佩蒂**（Tomas Pedy），你可能认识他，**Interactive Brokers**（盈透证券）。嗯，真是个很棒的人。他说他小时候在匈牙利长大，他说他小时候就知道每个人都在骗他。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Yeah. Listen, our biggest allies, our state auditors. I met with the state auditor in Minnesota. Uh confided that, you know, she's been trying to get this on the radar. Uh just people didn't want to listen. And I talked to folks within the agency, Healthy Human Services. U you were shuttled around. Uh one woman was actually escorted out of the building for raising the reality that there was fraud. And this happened over several years. And eventually either you leave if you're ethical or you be you're quiet because you don't want to get fired. And you make it such a a harsh environment for anybody to just tell the truth. This reminds me of a friend of mine who was uh he's a billionaire now. Tomas Pedy, you probably know him, Interactive Brokers. Uh really really great guy. And he said he was growing growing up in Hungary and he said when he was young he knew that everyone was lying to him.

</details>

**主持人**: 但那不是大问题。大问题是他知道他们知道他知道他们在骗他。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: But that wasn't the big problem. The big problem is he knew that they knew that he knew that they were lying to him,

</details>

**David Saxs**: 对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: right?

</details>

**主持人**: 所以很快我们都知道有一个弥天大谎。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So pretty soon we are all in on the fact that there's a big lie.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 整个事情都是腐败的。所以，在这些机构工作，好人被淘汰了。剩下的人要么不在乎，要么不是好人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: The whole thing is corrupt. And so working in these agencies, the good people are weeded out. The people who are left either don't care, aren't good people,

</details>

**主持人**: 或者同谋。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: or complicit.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 他们中的一些人是同谋。但我认为从根本上说，价值观存在错位。这实际上可能是我们去年在**工薪家庭减税立法**中必须做的最重要的事情。我们必须让总统与州长保持一致。有太多方法可以从联邦政府那里获得不属于你的钱。**合法洗钱计划**，各种各样聪明顾问多年来想出的东西，我们估计仅**Medicaid**就会损失5.4万亿美元，这就是为什么我经常开玩笑说，我们正在变成一个巨大的医疗系统，附带一个小国家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: And some of them are complicit. But I think fundamentally there was a misalignment of values. And this actually was probably the most important thing we had to do in that legislation last year, the working families tax cut legislation. We had to align the president with the governors. There were so many ways of getting this the federal government to give you money that wasn't really yours. legalized moneyaundering schemes, all kinds of things that clever consultants had figured out over the years that we estimated we would have lost 5.4 trillion dollars just for Medicaid, which is again why I often joke we were becoming one massive health care system with a small country attached.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，如果长期来看它不起作用，如果我们不采取大胆行动，这又是总统正在做的很多事情的一个重要信息，如果你不就这些问题采取大胆行动，你就会给下一代留下一个**烂摊子**。他们再也无法修复它了，因为火车已经完全脱轨了。是的。想想这种彻头彻尾的**虚伪**。像**曼达米**这样的人说他想增加服务，为公民提供更多，但他们不做审计。他们不打击欺诈。**加文·纽森**谈论想为社会底层提供更多，但也不做审计。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Well, and if it doesn't work long term, if we don't take bold action, which again a major message on a lot of things the president is doing, if you don't take bold action on some of these issues, you're leaving our the next generation with a train wreck. They can't fix it anymore because the train's gone way off the rails. Yeah. And just think of the absolute hypocrisy. You have someone like Mandami who says he wants to increase services, provide more for the citizens and they're not doing the audits. They're not fighting fraud. Gavin Newsome is talking about wanting to provide more for the bottom half of society, but not doing the audits.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 坦率地说，这个导致现在**资产没收税**的整个预算漏洞，都始于2022年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: And frankly, this whole budget hole that is causing this now acid seizure tax, it all started in 2022

</details>

**主持人**: 当**纽森**承诺为所有人，包括非法移民提供医疗服务时。所以发生的事情是，在一项漂亮的大法案中，总统说，听着，我们不会报销非法移民的费用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: when Newsome promised medical for all including illegal aliens. And so what happened is in big beautiful bill president said listen we're not going to reimburse for illegal aliens like

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 想想那里的激励机制。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: think about incentives there

</details>

**主持人**: 没错。所以**SEIU**，嗯，**医疗工会**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: right so then the SEIU uh the health worker union

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 他们很生气，因为他们不想削减那笔资金，因为它间接影响到他们。所以整个事情就是这样发生的。想想那里的欺诈层层叠叠，你知道，加州政府正在为**非法移民**支付费用，这可能不应该这样做。我的意思是，如果你问美国人民，也就是你们两位为之工作的人，有多少美国人认为**非法移民**应该获得全民医保，我想你会得到98%的人会说绝对不。而伯克利那2%有紫色头发的人想要。我...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: they're upset because they don't want that funding cut because it indirectly impacts them. So that's how this whole thing happened. Think about the layers of fraud there that you've got you know the the government the government of California is paying for illegal aliens probably shouldn't be doing that. I mean, if you ask the American people, which is who you both work for, how many Americans believe that illegal aliens should get universal healthcare, I think you're going to get like 98% are going to say absolutely not. And the 2% with purple hair in Berkeley who want it. I

</details>

**David Saxs**: 我不知道他们的动机是什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: I don't know what what their motivation is.

</details>

**主持人**: 支持他们。只是为了完成这个观点，如果你要推行**加文·纽森**的政治主张，并且你要说本州所有人，包括**非法移民**，都能获得福利，这难道不意味着你有责任审计这个系统，并确保它没有被滥用吗？当你然后对欺诈视而不见，你拒绝承认它，你只是假装它不存在，并且你否决了审计。那是双重错误。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Support them. Just to finish the point, if you are going to have the politics of a Gavin Newsome and you're going to tell Benal for all in the state, even illegal aliens, doesn't that create a responsibility on you to audit the system and make sure it's not being abused? When you then turn a blind eye Yeah. to the fraud and you refuse to even acknowledge it, you just pretend like it doesn't exist and you veto the audits. That's doubly wrong.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 但它不会伤害加州。这是故事中令人愤怒的部分。你不在加州审计账目，因为联邦政府反正会支付。那么我为什么要审计账目，以发现我的人民没有从联邦政府那里获得免费资金呢？我们来谈谈**非法移民**。所以**加文·纽森**因为我们威胁**非法移民**的医疗保险而给我们制造麻烦。非常透明地说，如果你有**Medicare**，你没有免费牙科。你没有免费视力。但如果你是加州的**非法移民**，你就有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: But but it doesn't hurt California. This is the the part of the story that's so infuriating. You don't audit the books in California because the federal government's paying anyway. So why would I audit the books to find out that my people aren't getting free money from the federal government? Let's talk about illegal immigrants. So Gavin Newsome was given us a hard time for threatening the health insurance of illegal immigrants. Just to be very transparent, if you're on Medicare, you don't get free dental. You don't get free vision. You do if you're an illegal immigrant in California.

</details>

**主持人**: 这就是劣势。所以，你们新墨西哥州的纳税人，对吧，这是一个蓝州，但也是一个穷州，支付额外的税款给联邦政府，这些钱又被回收到洛杉矶，用来处理我正在谈论的欺诈。所以**非法移民**，他很生气。他很生气。他很生气。他很生气。我们是糟糕的人。我们是共和党人。你没有良心。你没有爱心。一旦我们明确表示我们不再为加州的**非法移民**支付费用，他做了什么？他把他们从**Med-Cal**（加州医疗补助计划）中移除了。现在，他没有把他们移除。他把他们转移到了联邦层面。理论上，加州的**非法移民**只能获得**紧急服务**的支付，这是一项全国性法律。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: This is the inferior. So anyway, so you've got taxpayers in New Mexico, right, which is a blue state but a poor state, paying extra tax dollars to the federal government that are recycled back into LA to deal with the fraud that I'm talking about. So illegal immigrants, he's mad. He's mad. He's mad. He's mad. We're horrible people. We're Republicans. You have no conscience. You have no heart. As soon as we made it clear we were no longer going to pay for illegal immigrants in California, what did he do? He took them off Medcal. Now, he didn't take them off. He took them up on the federal side. In theory, only emergency services are going to get paid for for illegal immigrants in California, which is a national law

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 这是合理的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: and is and is reasonable.

</details>

**主持人**: 合理的。现在，我，我们希望有婴儿出生，车祸受害者受伤，当然要获得医疗保健，但不是选择性的**疝气手术**、**白内障**，你知道，你必须是为系统付费的美国公民才能获得这些。所以，无论如何，我们处理了这个问题。**加文**说：“我们只会通过我们自己的州级系统为**非法移民**支付费用。”我们已经审计了他。现在，这些数据本周将公布。我们现在已经发现超过15亿美元的资金被错误地使用了。我们已经审计了它。他们甚至没有争辩。加州向联邦政府收取了15亿美元的**非法移民**费用，而他们不允许向我们收取。他们必须自己支付。他不高兴。但他们正在支付我们，因为他们知道我们是对的。所以，你将看到加州发生一些非常有趣的事情。一旦资金由加州政府官员支付，他们就会开始更认真地对待这个问题。这就是为什么我们说：“我们不再参与其中了。我不会让阿拉巴马州和密西西比州、新墨西哥州，你知道，我们最贫困的州的纳税人为世界第四大经济体支付费用。”而且他们得到的更少。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Reasonable. Now, I'm I'm all we want babies delivered, car accident victims hurt, get of course get healthcare, but not elective hernia surgery, cataracts, you know, you have to be an American citizen who paid into the system to get these. So, anyway, so we we deal with this. Gavin says, "We're only going to pay for illegal immigrants through our own state-based system." We've audited him. Now, this data is coming out this week. We have now found over $1.5 billion dollar of money spent wrongly. We've audited it. They're not even arguing. $1.5 billion dollars from uh that California charged the federal government for illegal immigrants that they're not allowed to pay charge us for. They have to pay for it themselves. He's not happy. But they're paying us because they know we're right. So, you're going to see something happen very interesting in California. As soon as the money is being paid by California government officials, they're going to start getting more serious about this. And that's why it's so important for us to say, "We're not into this anymore. I'm not going to let taxpayers in Alabama and Mississippi, New Mexico, you know, our poorest states pay for the fourth largest economy in the world." And they get less.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 而且他们得到的更少。你知道，移民，我们是一个移民国家。你绝对可以相信合法移民，并希望关闭边境。我认为这是上次选举中决定性的问题。我的意思是，他们也选了一个糟糕的候选人，而且没有初选。抛开这些不谈。如果你...

**David Saxs**: And they get less. And you know, the immigr we're a country of immigrants. You could absolutely believe in legal immigration and want the border closed. That's what we saw in the last election. That was the deciding issue, I think, at the end of the day. I mean, they also picked a terrible candidate on the other side and didn't have a primary.

**David Saxs**: I'm minimizing.

</details>

**主持人**: 我只是说。我的意思是，你有点对抗了一个我们。无论如何，抛开这些不谈。你知道，我认为非常重要的一点是**激励机制**很重要。你在我们的谈话中多次提到这一点，尽管没有明确说出来。人们非法来到美国的动机是为了过上更好的生活，找到工作，获得这些社会服务。如果社会服务不可用，你知道，一些人就会留在原地。如果工作不可用，那么你为什么要冒险呢？你为什么要付给这些**蛇头**5到2.5万美元呢？你不会的。你会排队合法地做这件事。这是一个非常简单的解决方案。你只需要改变**激励机制**。让**非法移民**不可能为了这两件事来到这里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I'm just saying. I mean, you kind of went up against a we Anyway, put it aside. You know, the the thing that I think is super important is incentives matter. You you've said this many times without explicitly saying it in our conversation. The incentive for people to come to America illegally is to make a better life for themselves and to have a job, employment, and these social services. If the social services aren't available, you know, some number are going to stay back. And if the jobs aren't available, then why would you risk it? Why would you pay one of these coyotes 5 $25,000 across the board? You wouldn't. You would get in the line to do it properly. And that's a very simple solution here. You you just change the incentive. make it impossible for an illegal alien to come here for those two things.

**Dr. Oz**: I'm not going to make you guess.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 嗯，我本来想说对于雇主来说，插入你与员工的关系是非常重要的，因为员工不会离开一家公司。他们会根据医疗保健选择他们工作的公司，他们不会为了追求更好的机会而离开一家公司，以保留他们的医疗保健，这是功能失调的，因为你希望人才流动。这是一种独特的**硅谷创业思维**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Well, I was going to say for the employers I can say it's very acute to insert yourself into the relationship with your employees because employees will not leave one company. They'll pick the company they work for based on the healthare and they will not leave a company to pursue a better opportunity in order to keep their healthare which is dysfunctional because you want talent to move. That's a uniquely Silicon Valley entrepreneurial way to look at it.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 从雇主市场来看，嗯，我们认为钱应该跟着病人走，但广义上讲，因为我不监管商业保险。对于**非法移民**，对于你的家庭，这价值大约3万美元。所以，如果我们给你世界级的医疗保健覆盖，你没有充分的理由再回家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: From the employer market, uh we we think the money should follow the patient, but broadly speaking, because I don't I don't regulate commercial insurance. For illegal immigrants, for your family, it's worth about $30,000. So, there is no good reason for you to go back home again if we give you worldass healthcare coverage.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Yeah.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 所以，这是我们处理移民问题的一个主要问题，因为你不能合法地遣返1000万非法滞留在这里的人。总统说过这一点，你知道，我想他公开说过，但我认为他会。我们需要200年的法律操作才能遣返那些非法来到这里的人。所以，没有合法的途径来驱逐那些非法来到这里的人。你必须消除留在这里的动机。免费住房，免费食物，免费医疗。当然，你会留下来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: So, this is a major issue for us dealing with the immigration problem because you cannot send 10 million people back legally who are here illegally. The president has said this, you know, I think he said it publicly, but I think he would. It would take us 200 years of legal machinations to send back people who came here illegally. So, there is no legal path to expelling people who came here illegally. You have to remove the incentives to stay here. Free housing, free food, free healthcare. Of course, you're going to stay.

**主持人**: 给我一个激励，我就会给你结果。如果你看看**毒品战争**，嗯，它是多么不成功，嗯，人们去旧金山是有原因的，为了他们的**芬太尼**，因为他们可以买到，而且没有警察。这正是更多警察执法的功能，意味着这些毒品的价格上涨，这意味着消费下降。不仅在旧金山缺少这种动态，因为没有执法，你可以以5或10美元的价格买到**芬太尼**，他们还以每月800美元左右的价格提供住房。所以**无家可归者产业综合体**现在创造了一种激励，那个，你知道，真正悲惨的**瘾君子社区**里的每个人都知道这一点，他们离开德克萨斯州，离开其他州去那里，然后他们承受着后果，他们实际上正在增加痛苦。你对这些新的超级毒品和毒品重新分类有什么看法？嗯，**奥巴马**在他的第二个任期内想做这件事。他没有政治意愿或决心去做。而**特朗普**现在说：“嘿，也许对于**大麻**，我们应该重新考虑，并像加拿大和其他现代国家那样做。”你如何看待这些特定的毒品？**芬太尼**，在高峰期旧金山每天有9到12人过量吸毒。嗯，然后是**甲基苯丙胺**，那只是另一种...

**主持人**: Show me an incentive. I'll show you the outcome. If you look at the war on drugs, um how unsuccessful it's been, uh people go to San Francisco for a reason for their fentinel because they can buy it and there's no policing. And it is exactly a function of more policing means the price of those drugs go up, which means consumption goes down. Not only is there that dynamic missing in San Francisco because there's no enforcement and you can get fentinel for5 or $10 a hit, they also give you housing at $800 or something to that effect per month. So the homeless industrial complex has now created an incentive and everybody in that you know really tragic junky community knows that and they leave Texas they leave other states to go there and then they bear the brunt of it and they are actually increasing the suffering. What's your take on these new super drugs versus the the rescheduling of drugs? Uh Obama wanted to do it in his second term. He didn't have the political willpower or will to do it. And Trump now is saying, "Hey, maybe for cannabis we should rethink that and do what Canada's done in other modern nations." How do you look at those specific drugs? Fentinyl, 9 or 12 overdoses a day in San Francisco at the peak. Um, and then methamphetamine, which is just another

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: We have good substance use disorder medications. We can't get people into the programs. Uh this is why homelessness is an industrial complex and the states that have done it well. I mean I know Mayor Suarez in Miami dropped the number by 90%. And he did it just by making sure that you got arrested every time you peed publicly. And they don't put you in in jail. They put you in in rehab. But it takes four, five, six efforts. You can't give people free showers, great accommodations, lots of food, and then expect them to stop using drugs because you're enabling that behavior and not expecting bad outcomes, which is what happened. But I was in the in Kensington, Philadelphia, which is the drug capital of the East. And

</details>

**David Saxs**: 哦，这就是他们有那种其他超级毒品的地方。我忘了它的名字了。它非常有害。**Tran**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: oh, this is where they have that other super drug. I forgot the name of it. It's very pernicious. Tran.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 是的。**Tran**是一种可怕的药物。它会在你身体上造成大面积溃疡。所以我当时在那里，你知道，我只是在街上走着，和人们交谈，比如：“你为什么在这里？你从哪里来？你为什么不回家？”等等。我遇到了一个人，他刚刚用吸入器**纳洛酮**救了一个人的命。他是一名救护车司机。我说：“嗯，你知道发生了什么吗？”他说：“嗯，他们过量吸毒了。我给了他们**纳洛酮**。”我说：“嗯，他们醒来后怎么感谢你？从濒死状态，从那黑暗的深渊中醒来后，他们怎么感谢你？”他说，他们几乎总是对我非常愤怒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: Yeah. Tran is a terrible drug. It it creates massive ulcers on your body. And so I I was there and you know I I I I just walked the streets just talk to people like, "Why are you here? Where'd you come from? Why don't you go home, etc." And I I ran into a guy uh who had just saved someone's life giving them the lock zone as an inhaler. And he's an ambulance driver. And I said, 'Well, you know what happened? He says, 'Well, they odied. I gave it to them. And I said, 'Well, what did they tell you? How do they thank you when they awaken from near death, from that dark abyss of darkness? And he said, they're almost always livid at me.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 是的，你毁了他们的**快感**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Yeah, you ruined their high.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 嗯，不，你毁了他们的逃避。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: Well, not and you ruined their their escape.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 哦，他们实际上是希望结束这种痛苦。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Oh, they're they're actually hoping to end this suffering.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 痛苦太大了。这就是为什么它看起来很好。这就是为什么我告诉我在明尼苏达州的朋友，明尼苏达州的好人很好，当你真正真心实意的时候。但好人并不意味着允许你的公共卫生系统被强奸。它不意味着允许人们自我虐待，期望与历史上发生的不同结果。你需要，如果你真的爱一个人，你可能不喜欢他们，但如果你真的爱他们，你就会做一些超越那种事情的事情，最终让你赢得对他们的尊重，对你和你的尊重。有一个非常简单而艰难的道理，如果你从**基督教**的角度来看待它，嗯，如果你和任何一个父母交谈，这些可怜的父母正在为一个吸毒的孩子而痛苦，他们的成年孩子流落街头，你对他们说：“我们可以逮捕他们，把他们关进监狱。嗯，我们可以非常严厉地对待他们，并试图，你知道，只是把他们关起来，直到他们说：‘谢谢你。请这样做。’”但是有一群疯子认为你正在骚扰一个倒霉的无家可归者，你侵犯了他们的自由。但父母和家人会说：“请把他们关起来。那是我们最后的努力。”所以这不是**同情**。这根本不是**基督教**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: The pain was so bad. That's why it seems nice. And that's a that's why I was telling my friends in Minnesota, Minnesota nice is great when you really really mean it. But nice does not mean allowing your public health system to be raped. It's not allowing people to abuse themselves expecting a different outcome than what historically has happened. You need to if you really love people, you might not like them, but if you really love them, you'll do something that actually goes beyond like that makes you ultimately gain respect for them for you and you. There's a very simple tough and if you were to take a Christian view of it um and you were to talk to any of the parents, these poor parents who are suffering with a child addicted to drugs and their adult child is on the street and you said to them, "We can arrest them and put them in jail. Uh we can treat them incredibly severely and try to, you know, just lock them up until they they say, "Thank you. Please do that." But there are a bunch of lunatics who think you're harassing a homeless person who had a bad beat and you're infringing on their freedom. But the parents and the family would say, "Please lock them up. That's our last stitch effort." So it's not compassion. It is not Christian at all.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 我认为那是一场教员休息室的讨论，你穿着花呢夹克。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: I That's a faculty lounge discussion with your tweed jacket on. Yeah.

</details>

**Dr. Oz**: 还有你的护肘，当你滔滔不绝地谈论你读到的人时，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Oz**: And your elbow protectors when you're pontificating about people that you read about, right?

</details>

**David Saxs**: 嗯，我指出这一点是因为我在教员中，你知道，我一直...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Uh and I point that out because I'm on the facult, you know, I' I've been

</details>

**主持人**: 你有那种花呢夹克，你和那些花呢夹克的人交谈过。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You got one of those tweet you you talked to those tweet.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 是的。我把我的花呢夹克扔掉了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: Yeah. I got rid of my tweet jackets.

</details>

**主持人**: 肘部补丁，反正看起来也很糟糕。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: The elbow patches, they look terrible anyway.

</details>

**David Saxs**: 但你知道，你坐在那里，你表现得，这就是关于**智力**的疯狂之处，人们。你越聪明，你就越擅长欺骗自己和周围的人，因为你可以把几乎任何数据解释成某种实际上不存在的意义。我们容忍这种情况太久了。我实际上认为这是**特朗普总统**吸引力的重要组成部分。他**直言不讳**。不要告诉我那些违背常识的事情，因为**常识**并不那么常见。我认为...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: But you know, you sit there and you act and this is the the crazy thing about intelligence is people. The more intelligent you are, the better you are to lying to yourself and to others around you because you can construe almost any data into something that has, you know, a meaning that's not really there. And we have tolerated that for too long. I I actually think that's an important part of President Trump's appeal. He cuts through all that BS. Don't tell me stuff that just defies common sense because common sense is not so common. I think

</details>

**主持人**: 你不必接受它。我认为这是**特朗普**我认为教给一些人的另一件事。我们不必接受那种现状。你也不必接受它的框架。我们直说吧。你知道，我在这里的播客上用过“瘾君子”这个词，因为我是在70年代和80年代的纽约长大的，我们就是这样称呼那些吸毒成瘾的人的，**瘾君子**。这不是贬义词。它只是表明这种疾病有多严重。称之为**无家可归**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: you you don't have to accept it. I think that's the other thing that I think Trump has has I think taught some folks. We do not have to accept that state of affairs. You don't have to accept and the framing of it. Let's just call it what it is. You know, I've used the term here on our podcast and say junkies because I grew up in New York in the 70s and ' 80s and that's what we call people who are addicted to smack, junkies. It's not derogatory. It's an indication of just how bad that disease is. Calling it homelessness

</details>

**David Saxs**: 意味着你试图解决错误的问题。把一个**瘾君子**安置在一个家里。他们有很多家可以去。这与此无关。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: means you're trying to solve the wrong thing. Putting a junkie in a home. They have plenty of homes to go to. It's nothing to do with that.

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Saxs**: And uh he was looking for for uh names of AI experts in Silicon Valley to build his advisory panel and just impressed me right away with the the energy that you bring, the knowledge, the passion. You really do care about improving health outcomes for all Americans and I think we are very lucky to have you in this administration. uh from the president on down and I think the country is very lucky to have you could be doing many many different things but you really care about this job and I think it's really incredible what you're doing. Thank you for your service.

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Big fan obviously of your work in part because you brought a sense of clarity to many of the issues you discussed and I want to thank you David for being a you first of all using your ability to get people together. the power to convene is remarkably effective, but you've also demystified a lot of this and allowed the administration to embrace AI and technology in general. So, God bless you.
