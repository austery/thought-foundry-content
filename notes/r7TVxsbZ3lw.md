### 11月市场开局：重大新闻与财报前瞻

大家好，欢迎回到周日市场期货节目。我们已经进入了2025年的最后两个月，11月正式开启。10月份股市跌宕起伏，我们上周报道了美联储和大型科技公司财报等大量事件。现在，我们又迎来了新的一周，有很多值得讨论的话题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the Sunday market futures. We are live. We are three minutes early. I was like, you know what? I'm ready to go. we might as well get started. And we are here. Thank everybody for being here. Hope everyone had a great weekend. We've got November officially starting, folks. It's kind of crazy. It really is kind of crazy. We got two months left of 2025. It is November 2nd. Uh this year has gone relatively quick. I mean, October was up and down in regards to the stock market. We had a ton of stuff to cover last week with the Fed and big tech earnings, but October is done and we're here. We are live.</p>
</details>

本周末，一些新的访谈内容在网上疯传，特别是围绕Sam Altman和Satya Nadella的对话。我们将会讨论这些内容。此外，特朗普正在接受CBS《60分钟》的专访，因此在整个节目过程中，可能会有大量引述涌现。事实上，我们已经拿到了一些采访片段。特朗普五分钟前刚发推文说，如果不实施关税，我们将变成一个第三世界国家。最高法院本周将审理关税案，这将非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We got a lot to talk about. We have a bunch of different things that went viral over the weekend in regards to new interviews, particularly around Sam Alman and Satia Nadella. So, we're going to talk about that. Uh, we got Trump who's doing a CBS 60inut special interview right now. So, there's likely going to be a ton of quotes coming in uh throughout the course of this uh market future show. I mean, we're already getting quotes right now. We have a couple of clips already from the interview. So throughout the entire hour, you're probably going to get a bunch of different quotes and I will put them on the screen and we'll analyze what's going on. Trump already tweeted like five minutes ago that we will be a third world country without the tariffs going into effect. The Supreme Court will be looking at the tariffs case this week. So that's going to be really important. So we'll talk about that.</p>
</details>

我们还收到了巴菲特的一些更新，他的伯克希尔·哈撒韦公司公布了财报，这是沃伦·巴菲特和伯克希尔·哈撒韦的最后一个第三季度。我们将讨论他们的一些举措。此外，还有一系列宏观数据和图表需要关注，以预测11月的市场走势。明天，Palantir将发布财报，所以我们会做一个简短的预览。这确实是Palantir财报前夜，这应该是我报道Palantir的第18个季度了，坦率地说，这可能是最好的一个季度。我们还会谈到Grab。所以，这将是内容满满的一周。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh and then we got some updates from Buffett. He had earnings with Bergkshire Hathway. This is the last Q3 ever for Warren Buffett and Birkshshire Hathway. So we'll talk about some of the stuff they did. We have a bunch of different macro stats to look at, some charts in regards to what to expect in November. And then tomorrow, you've got Palunteer earnings. So, we're going to do a little bit of a preview on that. It is indeed happy Palunteer Eve. This is what this is the uh 4812 uh 15. This is I think the 18th quarter I've covered for Pounder. Just kind of crazy. And quite frankly, it might be the best quarter. So, we're going to talk about that. And then we got Grabby Grab as well. So, I mean, this is going to be a jam-packed week. Tomorrow is going to be absolutely insane with Palunteer and Grab, and we'll do a preview on what's going on with that. But, we have a lot a lot a lot to talk about.</p>
</details>

### 对 Nebius 和 Grab 的深度分析

在开始之前，我发布了两篇新的深度分析文章，分别是关于Nebius和Grab。Grab是我大约三个月前写过一篇17页深度分析的公司。我在周末对它进行了修订，并正式发布在了Substack上。大家可以免费订阅查看。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, thank you everybody for being here. Before we get started, deep dives are out. Two new deep dives. We have Nebas and Grabby. Grab is a uh company that I I did a 17page deep dive on about three months ago. I I I refined the deep dive over the weekend and I officially published it on Substack. Uh, and so there's the link right there. You guys can check it out. Free to subscribe. Uh, no payw wall, anything like that.</p>
</details>

很多人都在问关于Nebius的情况。我研究了Nebius，并且很难不对它持乐观态度，原因很简单：它提供了一种全栈集成的数据中心解决方案。我认为那些在股价20美元时就理解了这一论点的多头们已经获得了丰厚的回报。我在文章的前几段谈到了我为什么可能错过了这个故事。但在130美元的价位，我计算了一下，数字其实并不可怕。当然，他们能否获得另一个**超大规模云服务商**（Hyperscaler: 指的是像亚马逊AWS、微软Azure和谷歌云这样提供大规模云计算服务的巨头公司）的合同存在很大的执行风险。但我确实认为这家公司拥有**护城河**（Moat: 指的是公司能够保护其长期利润和市场份额免受竞争对手攻击的可持续竞争优势），而这是我一直以来最关心的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then Nebius, a lot of people were asking for it. And I looked at Nebas and I'll talk about it more tomorrow. Maybe we can talk about at the end of the show if people have some questions. Uh, look, it is really hard to not be bullish on Nebus Nebius from the simple perspective that it is a full stack integrated approach to data centers. And I think the bulls that understood that argument back when it was $20 have been supremely rewarded for it. Uh, I obviously did not understand that thesis, nor did I really pay attention to it. And then the first half of the the Substack or I guess the first kind of like eight paragraphs of the article, I talk about why I likely missed the story. Uh, but at 130, look, I did the numbers. The numbers are in the chat or in in the in the chat in the substack. It's not that scary. It really isn't. Now, there is a large execution risk on if they can get another hyperscaler deal, but I mean at 94 it was a really good buy and unfortunately I just sold puts on it. But at 130, honestly, it's not that scary. The execution is the biggest risk. But I do think the company has a moat. And I think that's the biggest thing I've been concerned about, Neb, is like, do they have a moat or are they just another data center plate? I think they have a moat. And as a result, uh, it's exciting.</p>
</details>

我目前还没有仓位，我在文章中解释了原因，但它已经进入我2026年的观察名单。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I don't have a position yet. I talk about why I don't have a position in the article, but it is on my list for 2026, and we're going to see what goes on from there.</p>
</details>

### 市场期货与中美关系动态

好了，让我们开始吧。期货市场即将开盘。我认为我们将迎来一个相对绿色的开盘，目前上涨了0.3%。特朗普已经确认中美之间达成了一项协议，我们稍后会讨论具体情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, let's get started. Thank you everybody for being here. In 14 minutes, we are going to get the overnight markets to open and uh we're going to see what happens in overnight. futures. First of all, for those that haven't seen it, I think we're going to open up relatively green. We are up 0.3%. Trump has confirmed there is a USChina deal and so we'll talk about what's going on with the US China deal.</p>
</details>

期货市场是绿色的。特朗普确认中美之间应该会有一项协议正在进行中。我不知道中国方面是否已经确认了有正式的协议，这可能就是我们市场上涨的原因。但一旦隔夜市场开盘，我们会得到更多细节。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, futures are green. Trump confirmed there should be a China deal going on. Uh I don't know if China has confirmed that there is an official China deal and that's why I think we are green, but we're going to get some details on that uh once the overnight markets open and we'll talk about that.</p>
</details>

我们还有一些关于劳动力市场的新图表需要关注。过去几周我们一直在讨论劳动力市场，上周最大的事件是裁员数量，特别是亚马逊裁员3万人。我们将讨论这一点及其对劳动力市场的影响。但总的来说，我认为隔夜市场上涨的原因是特朗普和中国之间的关系似乎出现了一些稳定。他们在周四会面，这在周五提振了市场。10月份我们连续第六个月收涨，当月上涨了2.4%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have some new charts on the labor market. That's also really important to look at. We've been talking a lot about the labor market over the past couple weeks. The biggest thing that we looked at was the amount of layoffs that we had last week, especially with Amazon with those 30,000 layoffs. So, we're going to talk about that and some implications on the labor market. But overall, I think the reason we're green right now overnight is because it looks like there's some some stability between Trump and China. again they met back on Thursday and that helped the markets on Friday. We did close green for the sixth month in a row in October. So we closed out October up 2.4% for the month.</p>
</details>

通常情况下，11月份市场表现也相对不错。10月份有些波动，比特币和以太坊在10月份表现不佳，也许11月情况会有所改变，如果真是这样，那将是利好。现在以太坊有了一些提振，曾一度冲向4000美元，现在回落到3883美元。比特币也一度突破11万美元，而上周某个时候还在10.4万美元。我认为，如果说有哪个月份比特币和以太坊会表现良好，那很可能就是11月，因为比特币在11月的表现通常比10月要好一些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and then overall, you know, November is relatively green usually and so we had a bit of a choppy October. Bitcoin and Ethereum kind of sucked in October. Maybe that changes for November and if that does that would be bullish. Now Ethereum is getting a little bit of a boost. It was pushing 4,000. Now it's back to 38.83. Bitcoin as well pushing above 110. It was at 104 at one point last week. So, I mean, I think if there was any month for Bitcoin and Ethereum to do well, it would be November, as Bitcoin actually tends to do a little bit better in November than October. But, we're going to see how these turn out as we get into the end of the month.</p>
</details>

### Sam Altman 的争议性回应

好了，在隔夜市场开盘前，我们先来看看这个视频，因为它已经彻底火了。Sam Altman和Satya Nadella一起上了Brad Gersonner的播客。Brad Gersonner问了一个相对简单的问题：我一直听说你们有130亿美元的收入，但你们却承诺要支出1.4万亿美元。我想我们每个人每天都在质疑，如果OpenAI无法兑现这些支出承诺，这会不会是一个会爆炸的泡沫？以下是Sam Altman先生对这个问题的回答。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so in about 12 minutes, we are going to have the overnight markets open and then we'll get into all the topics I've lined up after the overnight markets open. Before that, let's just take a look at this video because it has absolutely gone viral. Sam Alman was on the Brad Gersonner podcast with Satia Nadella and Brad Gersonner asked a relatively simple question which is hey I keep hearing you have 13 billion in revenue but you've committed to spend 1.4 trillion I think every day all of us question could this be a bubble that explodes if open AAI isn't able to officially spend on these commitments that they've committed to spend on and here is what Mr. Sam Alman had to say to that question.</p>
</details>

>> Brad Gersonner: 你知道，一家年收入130亿美元的公司怎么能做出1.4万亿美元的支出承诺？你也听到了那些批评。

>> Sam Altman: 首先，我们的收入远不止那个数。其次，Brad，如果你想卖掉你的股份，我可以帮你找个买家。[笑声]

>> Brad Gersonner: 我只是觉得，你知道，有很多人想买OpenAI的股票。我不认为你想要……

>> Sam Altman: 包括我自己。那些对我们的计算资源等问题表现出极大担忧的人，会很乐意购买股份。所以我想我们可以很快就把你的或其他任何人的股份卖给那些在Twitter上对此事大声嚷嚷的人。我们确实计划收入会急剧增长，而且收入正在急剧增长。我们正在做一个前瞻性的赌注，即它将继续增长，不仅ChatGPT会持续增长，我们还将能够成为重要的人工智能云之一，我们的消费设备业务将成为一个重要且有意义的业务，能够自动化科学的人工智能将创造巨大的价值。所以，你知道，我很少想成为一家上市公司，但为数不多的吸引人的时候之一，就是当那些人写着那些荒谬的“OpenAI即将倒闭”之类的文章时。我很想告诉他们可以直接做空股票，我很想看到他们因此被烧得体无完肤。但是，我们有周密的计划，我们了解技术和能力将走向何方，以及我们能围绕它构建什么样的产品并产生收入。我们可能会搞砸，这是我们正在下的赌注，并且我们为此承担了一定的风险。一个确定的风险是，如果我们没有计算资源，我们将无法产生收入或制造出这种规模的模型。

>> Brad Gersonner: 完全正确。

>> Satya Nadella: Brad，让我说一件事，作为合作伙伴和投资者，我从未见过OpenAI提出的任何商业计划而他们没有超额完成的。所以在某种意义上，这是他们在增长甚至业务方面表现出令人难以置信的执行力的地方。坦率地说，我的意思是，显然OpenAI的成功、使用率等等都被大家谈论，但即使是整体的业务执行力也相当令人难以置信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> How, you know, how can a company with 13 billion in revenues make 1.4 trillion of spend commitments? You know, and and and you've heard the criticism.
>> First of all, we're doing well more revenue than that. Second of all, Brad, if you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. [laughter]
>> I just enough like, you know, people are I I think there's a lot of people who would love to buy OpenAI shares. I don't I don't think you want,
>> including myself. including myself
>> who talk with a lot of like breathless concern about our comput stuff or whatever that would be thrilled to buy shares. So I think we we could sell you know your shares or anybody else's to some of the people who are making the most noise on Twitter whatever about this very quickly. We do plan for revenue to grow steeply. Revenue is growing steeply. We are taking a forward bet that it's going to continue to grow grow and that not only will chache keep growing but we will be able to become one of the important AI clouds that our consumer device business will be a significant and important thing that AI that can automate science will create huge value. So, you know, there are not many times that I want to be a public company, but one of the rare times it's appealing is when those people are writing these ridiculous open AI is about to go out of business and you know, whatever. I would love to tell them they could just short the stock and I would love to see them get burned on that. Um, but
you know, I we carefully plan, we understand where the technology, where the capability is going to grow, go and and how the products we can build around that and the revenue we can generate. we might screw it up like this is the bet that we're making and we're taking a risk along with that. A certain risk is if we don't have the compute, we will not be able to generate the revenue or make the models at these at this kind of scale.
>> Exactly. And
>> let me just say one thing uh Brad as both a partner and um an investor there is not been a single business plan that I've seen from OpenAI that they have put in and not beaten it. So in some sense this is the one place where you know in terms of their growth and just even the business it's been unbelievable
execution quite frankly I mean obviously openai everyone talks about all the success in the usage and what have you but even um I would say all up uh the business execution has been just pretty unbelievable.</p>
</details>

### 对 Altman 回应的深度解读

这个片段之所以在周末疯传，原因如下：首先，这是一个合理的问题。博通、甲骨文、AMD、英伟达，根据《华尔街日报》上周的一篇文章，仅凭他们与英伟达达成的交易公告，市值就增加了6300亿美元。AMD股价之所以能达到250美元，唯一的原因就是与OpenAI的这笔交易。这凸显了这笔交易和OpenAI的支出承诺是多么重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, so the reason that went so viral over the weekend, we got about nine minutes till the overnight markets open and uh then we'll get into all the other topics. But the reason that went viral and when I saw it, I was quite surprised as well is number one, it's a legit question. Okay, Broadcom, Oracle, AMD, Nvidia, there was an article last week from the Wall Street Journal have gained 630 billion in market cap just from the announcements of the deals that they have uh committed to Nvidia. I mean AMD probably will be stuck at $158 a share for everyone. I know there's a big retail army in AMD. The o the literal only reason that stock is at 250 is because of this opening eye deal. That's it. And if someone else has a different reason, let me know. But that was the reason that got the stock to break out. So it is so and the reason is not to downplay the significance of that deal. It's rather to un to underwrite how important the deal is and the spending commitments that are necessary to get AMD to that $400 billion market cap or to get Oracle to that $800 billion market cap which is pledged from OpenAI.</p>
</details>

当Brad Gersonner，作为OpenAI早期最大的投资者之一，问你一个简单的问题时，他其实是在给你一个轻松得分的机会，而不是想刁难你。他想给你一个机会来简单地解释。如果是我，我会说：“看，很多人以为我们年收入130亿美元，实际上我们远超于此。”（估计接近250亿美元）。“其次，我们预计到2027年，收入可能会达到千亿级别。” 这样一来，1.4万亿美元的支出承诺（大约是预期收入的14倍）就不会显得那么疯狂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when Brad Gersonner who by the way is one of the bigger investors from the previous two years he was early in 2023 in the private rounds of OpenAI so he knows the company very well. When your biggest supporter is asking you a very simple question he's basically giving you a layup. He's not trying to give you a gotcha question. this guy has a ton of your stock. Why would he be trying to make you look bad? He's trying to give you the opportunity to simply say this is if obviously I'm all I would be like look a lot of people think we're doing 13 billion in revenue. We are doing significantly more than that which he wouldn't be lying about. I think the estimate is closer to 25 billion in revenue. Number two, our estimates are that by 2027 we're probably going to be hitting triple digits. So about 100 billion in revenue, which Sam Alman mentions a little bit later in the podcast, but he does it in kind of like a an egotistic way, right? He makes like he he kind of says it he says it in a way that's bragging when in reality he could have just answered the question be like look we're projecting we don't know if it's going to happen but we think by 2027 we could get to 100 billion revenue which makes the 1.4 4 trillion spend, which is only about 14 times the amount of revenue they're they're bringing in. Not look as crazy as the $1 13 billion annual run rate.</p>
</details>

然后他本可以说：“我们有像你Brad、Satya、Jensen和Lisa Su这样优秀的人支持我们，因此我们非常有信心能够兑现我们的支出承诺。” 这就够了。这是一个绝佳的机会，让他向所有信任他公司的人表示感谢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then he could have said, you know, let people say whatever they want to say. We have amazing people like you, Brad, that support us. We have amazing people like Satia and Jensen and Lisa Sue that support us. And because we have all these really smart people supporting our company and our growth, we are very confident that we're going to be able to commit to the spending that we have said that we're going to commit to publicly. That's it. That's all you have to say. That's literally all he It was such a layup for him to give a compliment to all the people that are trusting that his company's going to succeed. He could give them a compliment back and say because they believe in us so much, you know, we're so excited to continue working on this journey. And that would have been the end of it.</p>
</details>

相反，他变得自恋起来，说什么“我希望我们是上市公司，这样我就可以告诉人们去做空股票”。他试图模仿Karp（Palantir CEO）的风格，但很少有人能模仿Karp的行为而仍然保持魅力。大多数人这样做只会显得像个混蛋。我认为这是一个奇怪且过度防御的回应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Instead, he turns into this like narcissistic, oh, I wish we were a public company so I could tell people to short the stock. He tried to pull a Karp moment and it's like there's a reason Karp is Karp. Very few people can emulate what Karp does and still be relatively charismatic. Most people that try to do that are not going to be charismatic. They're going to just seem like dicks. And uh you know that's that's what he ended up doing. So I thought it was a a weird response. I think it was overly defensive.</p>
</details>

讽刺的是，即使你讨厌Sam Altman，如果你投资了这个市场，你也必须相信OpenAI会赢。他们已经“大到不能倒”了。AMD、Oracle、Nvidia的市值增长都与OpenAI息息相关。除非像Gemini或XAI这样的公司能大规模超越ChatGPT每周8亿的活跃用户，否则OpenAI似乎必须赢。所以你不得不为他们的成功加油，尽管运营它的人在回答问题时并不那么有魅力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But like at the end of the day, if Sam is acting like that to one of his biggest supporters, aka Brad Gersonner, I wonder how he acts to other people, you know? in an age where every single AI company is depending on this company, OpenAI, which is the catch 22. It's like even if you hate Sam Alman, even if that clip pissed you off so much, even if you think this guy is squirmy and you just want nothing to do with him, if you are invested in this market, you have to believe OpenAI is going to win. It is just that simple. And I would love any analysis from someone telling me that OpenAI can lose and the AI bull market can continue because I've looked at the numbers. I'm working on a Substack piece about this coming out next week and it it there is no way OpenAI essentially they're too big to fail. It's just that simple. They're too big to fail given this. And you can say, "Oh, well, what about XAI Gemini?" Sure. But the reason AMD is at a $400 billion market cap is because of OpenAI. The reason Oracle is pushing 700 800 billion is because of OpenAI. The reason Nvidia to an extent has added the level of market cap that's added is because of OpenAI. So, at the end of the day, it's like unless a company like Gemini or or uh XAI massively overtake the 800 million weekly activives that CHABT has, feels like opening eye is too big. And as a result, they kind of have to win. So you kind of have to root for their success if you're invested in the AI ecosystem. But the guy who's running it is obviously not the most charismatic in terms of how we answer that question.</p>
</details>

### 市场开盘动态

隔夜市场已经开盘。标普500指数上涨0.37%。SoFi上涨约0.74%，AMD上涨1.12%。Palantir上涨1.2%，达到203美元。英伟达上涨0.7%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, 5 seconds. Let's see what we got. Overnight markets for November are officially open. Here we go. S&P that's up 7% 684. We got a green S&P. SoFi is up about 74% as well. AMD that's up 1.12%. Hoodie 148 that did have a 6% move on uh on Friday which was very nice to see. Palunteer 203 that's up 1.2%. We will do a little bit of a pounder preview. Nvidia, that's up n7%.</p>
</details>

我很高兴看到英伟达上涨，因为特朗普在CBS的采访中说，他和Jensen谈过，并同意Blackwell芯片不应该卖给我们的最大竞争对手。这可能意味着Blackwell芯片短期内不会进入中国市场。尽管如此，英伟达股价还是上涨了，这很好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, I I'm I'm happy that Nvidia is up almost 1% because Trump did say in that CBS interview that um I talked to Jensen and essentially he said that we agreed that Blackwell should not be going well, he agreed. I don't know if Jensen agreed that Blackwell should not be going to our biggest competitors. I don't know what that necessarily means for Blackwell chips and I definitely don't think we're getting China revenue anytime soon. Jensen did have another interview that will look at it. well in a little bit. But, uh, Trump did kind of signal that, you know, maybe Blackwell is not going to be going to China anytime soon. So, the fact that Nvidia is actually up and not going down on that, I think is nice to see.</p>
</details>

Meta股价目前在652美元左右，本周我会做更多研究来理解它的估值。我倾向于认为这次下跌在一年后会显得很愚蠢，但**资本性支出**（Capex: Capital Expenditure，指的是公司用于购买、维护或升级固定资产（如设备、建筑）的资金）方面确实存在执行风险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Meta I am doing a lot more work to understand meta is multiple it's up about 1%. I really am leaning towards this dip is going to look stupid in a year but then again there is an execution risk on this capex stuff that I keep thinking is stupid but then I keep thinking well you know maybe the market's right about it. So I'll have some updated thoughts on Meta throughout the week but I don't know I my gut says it's a buy at these and even if it goes back to 600 okay you DCA at 600 and uh you hold on for the long term.</p>

微软上周因为对OpenAI计提了40亿美元的减值费用而股价受挫，从540美元跌至520美元。考虑到其业务的其他部分，尤其是Azure 40%的增长，都非常火爆，我不明白为什么市场对此反应如此激烈。目前在隔夜市场中基本持平。

<p class="english-text">Microsoft the ICE. I mean, look, the reason Microsoft got hit last week is because they took a $4 billion impairment charge for OpenAI, which I don't know why the street is that upset about given the rest of the business was absolutely on fire, including Azure going at 40%. But you did get Microsoft fall from about 540 to 520. That one is basically flat in the in the overnight markets.</p>

### Jensen Huang 谈美国制造与中国市场

让我们来听听Jensen的采访，这为我们接下来的讨论奠定了基础。他在福克斯新闻上谈到了中国、特朗普以及当前局势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, cool. So, let's get into it. I think we'll start off with uh this Jensen interview because this probably frames a lot of stuff that we got to talk about. So this was Jensen. He was on Fox this morning and this is everything that he had to say about China, Trump, what's going on.</p>
</details>

>> 主持人: Jensen，在亚利桑那州制造这款Blackwell芯片有多困难？将如此重要的芯片生产带回美国有多难？

>> Jensen Huang: 首先，人工智能是一场工业革命，这是我们这个时代最重要的技术。特朗普总统刚上任时，他希望我们将这些关键技术放在本土制造。他希望重新工业化美国，希望能源增长，并确保美国在人工智能领域处于领先地位。为了做到这一点，我们需要在能源、芯片、构建AI基础设施和工厂方面领先。他希望以光速实现这一切。我告诉他，通过与台积电、富士康、纬创、Amcor和Spill等优秀伙伴合作，我们将在9个月内将制造业带回美国。现在，我们已经在美国亚利桑那州实现了全球最先进AI芯片的量产。

>> 主持人: 在美国制造比在台湾贵很多吗？

>> Jensen Huang: 是的，在美国制造更贵，但我们会随着时间的推移做得更好。将制造业迁回本土，建立首个此类工厂，成本会高一些，但这没关系。国家安全、供应链韧性、在美国创造就业机会等好处是巨大的。这些AI超级计算机将进入AI工厂，被美国的每一个行业使用，这将创造数百万个高质量的就业机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Tell me about manufacturing this Blackwell chip in Arizona Jensen. How difficult was that to achieve to bring such an important chip production here to America?
>> Well, first of all, AI is a industrial revolution and this is the most important technology of our time, potentially the most important technology of all time. And when President Trump first took office, uh he wanted us to manufacture these critical technologies on shore. He wanted to re-industrialize the United States. He wants to have energy growth. He wants to make sure that United States is a leader in artificial intelligence. And in order to do in order to do so, we need to lead in energy. We need to lead in chips. We need to lead in building AI infrastructures and factories including lead in building AI models of course, but also using AI in all the different applications in various industries from healthcare to manufacturing to robotics to you know science and and industry. So uh he wanted he wanted that uh in his administration and he wanted it at the speed of light and so I told him that we would bring manufacturing back within 9 months with the partnership of TSMC which is an incredible partner for the United States Foxcon Wistron Amcor and Spill we've been able to manufacture now the most advanced AI chip in the world completely in the United States and Arizona the the the the the workers worked incredibly hard the mechanical engineers, the mechanical, the electricians, the plumbers, the construction workers, they all worked around the clock. Nine months later, we're now in volume production of the most advanced AI chip in the world. I
>> Is it much more expensive to do it in the United States versus Taiwan?
>> It is. It is more more expensive to do in the United States, but we're going to get better over time. you know, reman reonshoring manufacturing and the first uh plant of its kind. It's going to cost a little bit more money, but that's okay. the the uh the national security benefits uh the supply chain resilience benefits the job creation benefits here in the United States you know we're going to manufactured chips systems and those systems are going these these AI supercomputers are going to go into what are going to be AI factories which are going to be used by every single industry in the United States and so this is going to create over time you know my guess is millions of jobs, millions of jobs and really really high quality jobs, you know, from high really skilled trade craft. And</p>

当被问及这对英伟达的中国业务意味着什么时，他是这样回答的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's what he had to say specifically when he was asked about what this means for the China part of Nvidia's business.</p>
</details>

>> 主持人: 这项协议对你和英伟达向中国销售产品意味着什么？

>> Jensen Huang: 这是一次里程碑式的会议和交易。两位总统之间建立的友好关系，以及两国之间的关系都非常了不起。我希望这能为英伟达重返中国市场竞争创造条件。在特朗普第一届政府期间，他为美国引领技术设定了完美的基调，确保美国公司拥有最好和最先的技术，并让美国科技公司走向世界竞争并获胜。但在过去四年里，本届政府的政策适得其反。我们在中国市场的份额从特朗普总统离任时的95%降至现在的0%。所以现在是时候重置，回到特朗普45届政府的政策，让美国AI公司能够去中国竞争，在全球推广美国的技术标准，这样我们就能引领世界。我希望我们能够恢复到特朗普45届政府的政策，重返市场并参与竞争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> We'll suspend the implementation of relevant export controls. What does this agreement mean for you and Nvidia with regard to selling to China?
Well, what an achievement. This is a milestone meeting, a milestone deal, a historic deal. And the readouts uh from from all the news that I've read uh just the respectful uh the friendly relationship that they've built uh between the two presidents and of course between the two countries. Therefore, uh the the post from Secretary Heg Heath and uh and all the readouts from uh Secretary Bessant have have all been extraordinary. You know, this really creates the conditions I hope uh for Nvidia to be able to go back and compete in market in China. Trump 45 in the in President Trump's first administration. Uh he set the tone perfectly for America to lead in technology and make sure that America American companies have the best and first but for American technology companies to go around the world to compete and win. In the last four years, the administration really set us on a path that really backfired. the policies have really backfired from a 95% market share in in the China market which is one of the most important markets in the world when President Trump left office and video's market share in China is now 0%. And so this is really time and it's a great great opportunity for us to reset back to the Trump 45 policies for the Trump 45 policies where AI American AI companies are able to go around go to China compete for compete in the marketplace and be able to diffuse and and proliferate American technology standards around the world so that we could set global standards so that uh the world is built on American standards so that we could lead the world. And so I I think uh creates the conditions for us to do that. I hope we're able to to um revert back to the policies of the Trump 45 administration and and um get back get back into the market and compete.</p>

### 特朗普对Blackwell芯片和中美协议的立场

很多人将Jensen的评论解读为中国市场即将回归。但他只是说“希望”协议的影响能让英伟达重获中国市场份额。然而，20分钟前，特朗普的言论让我很惊讶英伟达股价竟然上涨了。这是他对Blackwell芯片的原话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that was the comment by Jensen. A lot of people interpreted that as China's coming back. Obviously he did not say China's coming back. He's saying hopefully the uh implications of the Trump and Xi deal will lead to China revenue or will will lead to China market share hopefully coming back for Nvidia because right now their market share is zero. And then 20 minutes ago you had this from Trump which is why I was surprised Nvidia is actually up in the overnight markets. But this is exactly what he said about Blackwell.</p>
</details>

>> 主持人: 关于英伟达呢？

>> 特朗普: 我经常和他（Jensen）见面，他很棒。这是一家伟大的美国公司，现在是世界上最大的公司。新的Blackwell芯片比其他任何芯片都领先10年。但我们不把那个芯片给其他人。

>> 主持人: 我们不把那个芯片给其他人？

>> 特朗普: 我们不把那个芯片给其他人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Nvidia smoke. What about it?
>> So are you planning to meet with him? you said when you were
>> I meet with look he's one of the great geniuses of our time his chips are 10 year years ahead of anybody else's and you know I meet with him all the time he's a great it's a great American company it's now the biggest company in the world
uh so what would you like to know is a is really just a brilliant company the chips are 10 years the new blackwell that just came out it's 10 years ahead of every other chip
But there's nothing to meet with other than say congratulations.
>> But no, we don't give that chip to other people.
>> We don't give that ship to other people.
>> Are you meeting with the Syrian president at the White House?
>> That last sentence, we don't give that chip to other people.</p>
</details>

他明确表示：“我们不把那个芯片给其他人”，这意味着如果特朗普对英伟达保持类似立场，Blackwell芯片的收入可能不会来自中国。尽管特朗普对英伟达大加赞赏，但如果他不准备把Blackwell芯片给中国，而中国方面又明确表示不想要次级产品，那么问题就来了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, look, maybe Trump is just saying that because he wants to get a little bit more of a negotiation on what we get with China. Uh, but as you can see, he clearly said, "We don't give that chip to other people." which means the blackwell chip is likely not coming back in terms of revenue if this is the similar stance that Trump is going to have on Nvidia. So even with the praise of Nvidia, even with Jensen bringing GTC to DC, even with Jensen obviously praising the Trump administration and saying that he believes in this whole American re-industrialization, if Trump is not ready to give the Blackwell chip to China, I would imagine China wants the chip and China has already said back in the summer they don't want anything less than Blackwell because if you give them something less than Blackwell, then they might as well just build their own chip, which creates the entire problem that Jensen's been talking about for American technology not being the foundation for overall AI technology around the world.</p>
</details>

那么贸易关系到底发生了什么？根据美国政府网站昨晚发布的内容，中国将暂停新的稀土出口管制，发放稀土出口通用许可证，采取重大措施阻止芬太尼流入美国，并暂停自3月4日以来的所有报复性关税和非关税措施，同时购买至少1200万吨美国大豆。美国则将关税降低10%（从57%降至47%），并将**301条款关税**（Section 301 tariff: 指的是依据美国《1974年贸易法》第301条款，美国政府用来应对外国不公平贸易行为而征收的关税）豁免期限延长至2026年11月。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now what actually happened with the trade relations? So this came out last night. This was published on the US.gov website and this is exactly what they said. The Chinese are going to suspend new rare earth export controls. They're going to issue general licenses for exports of rare earths. They're going to take significant measures to end the flow of fentinel to the US. They're going to suspend all retaliatory tariffs since March 4th. suspend all retaliatory non-tariff measures since March 4th and purchase at least 12 million metric tonses of US soybeans. The US is going to lower tariffs by 10% from uh 57 to 47, extend the expiration of section 301 tariff exclusions until November 2026 published by the White House yesterday.</p>
</details>

其中没有提到中国将正式获得Blackwell芯片，但我认为这让市场松了一口气，因为年底可能爆发的大规模贸易战似乎得以避免。当然，这还需要中方确认，但他们似乎已经购买了一些大豆以示诚意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So nothing in that says that China will officially get Blackwell, but I think it's giving the market a lot of ease now that there's not this massive trade war that might break out towards the end of the year. Obviously, the Chinese have to confirm this, but I think they already bought some soybeans as a sign of good faith. And, you know, given the negotiations that happened last week that we covered, it seems like everything is relatively okay and the export controls on rare earths that kind of really got everyone scared globally might not be happening and as a result, you know, that might be the good thing.</p>

### 分化的经济：消费股疲软与财富效应

现在，让我们谈谈经济的总体状况。上周很多股票受到冲击，特别是面向消费者的股票，这表明实体经济可能存在一些问题，即便华尔街尚未感受到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Having said that, let's talk about Basent. So, here is Bent talking about the general state of the economy right now. And the reason this is important is because a lot of stocks last week took a hit. And we're going to talk about those stocks in a second. But a lot of those stocks are more consumer oriented stocks showing maybe there's some issues on Main Street, even if not on Wall Street yet.</p>
</details>

看看这些重要消费股的年初至今回报率：Chipotle，其CEO直言年收入低于10万美元的25至34岁人群进店次数减少；Wendy's今年下跌44%；Lululemon下跌54%；惠而浦下跌35%；梅西百货下跌27%。当你看到这些消费股时，情况有点难看。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so take a look at this right here. These are the year-to-ate returns on some very important consumer stocks. Chipotle, we all saw last week what happened with their earnings. The CEO literally said people making less than 100,000 from ages 25 to 34 are not entering the store as much. Wendy's was down 44% this year. I didn't even know that was the case. Lululemon, that's been a train wreck, down 54%. Whirlpool down 35%, although they did have good earnings. Macy's down 27%. Caesars down 38%. Under Arour down 36. I mean, it's a little ugly when you look at these consumer stocks.</p>
</details>

另一张图表显示了更多情况：金宝汤、通用磨坊、卡夫亨氏、高露洁、宝洁，这些都是今年表现最差的股票。这引出了一个问题：消费领域到底发生了什么？人们确实在受苦。即使我们是资产持有者，也不能忽视经济中有人正在挣扎的事实。这就是为什么需要降息，以缓解低端消费者的压力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's another chart that shows even more. the Camples company, General Mills, Craft Hind, Colgate, uh, Proctor and Gamble. These have been the worst performing stocks of the entire year. So, there's two kind of nuanced points around this. Number one is has has have these companies been the best companies in the world. Probably not. I would imagine Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, etc. are executing a lot better [snorts] than Proctor and Gamble and and Lululemon. So, that that's the first point. But second of all, the reason I think people are starting to wonder what's going on with the consumer is because these are consumer oriented companies and it's not just Chipotle. There's a lot of other fast food brands. And I don't think even if we are asset holders, we can ignore the fact that obviously people are hurting in this economy. Which is why Bent was asked this question. Wait a second. If we don't cut rates and you're seeing Chipotle take a 45% draw down this year, 20% in a week, like what's going on for the low end of the consumer that likely needs to get a little bit of relief on their personal loan payment to refinance it or their auto loan payment?</p>
</details>

然而，这也引出了关于**财富效应**（Wealth Effect: 指的是当人们持有的资产（如股票、房产）价值上升时，他们会感觉更富有，从而倾向于增加消费的经济现象）的讨论。以下是《The Compound and Friends》周末节目中关于这个话题的一段剪辑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Having said that, this leads into the conversation around the wealth effect. Here is a two to three minute clip from the compound and friends this weekend talking about this idea of the wealth effect because again that is why it looks like the economy is holding up.</p>
</details>

>> 我认为财富效应是经济中最重要的因素，没有之一。它决定了就业、工资增长，甚至资本支出项目。没有什么比股价下跌30%更能迅速阻止AI资本支出了。因此，我认为我们低估了股市影响实体经济的能力。福特和通用汽车本周创下52周新高。为什么？因为财富效应让人们走进经销商购买新的F-150。需求从未减弱，因为每个人的股票投资组合都处于历史高位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I want to double click on that because like this is the hill that I like to die on every week. I'm a wealth effect truther. I think it's the number one most important factor in the economy, bar none. It decides employment. It decides whether or not people get wage increases. I think it decides capex spending projects. Nothing will halt AI capex in its tracks faster than a stock price that falls 30%. Nothing. And so, as a result, I really think we underpric the ability of the stock market to influence things that happen in the real economy. Ford and GM made 52 week highs this week. The story there is the wealth effect is what sends people to the dealership to buy a new F-150. Not trade war [ __ ] These companies have handled this tariff war handled this this tariff situation so well, not because they're in control of the prices of of the supplies they buy, but because the demand never let up. The demand never let up because everyone's stock portfolio is at a record high.</p>
</details>

这是一个很好的观点。一个有趣的数据是：现在35岁左右的人，股票占其净值的比例是23%。而婴儿潮一代在35岁时，这个比例只有7%。这是一个巨大的差异。当科技股领涨市场时，35岁及以下的年轻人大多投资于他们理解的公司，如英伟达、特斯拉、亚马逊，这些公司表现良好，从而放大了财富效应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, look, I think it's a good point. I think it's something we cannot ignore. And what's really important is another stat from the show that was that was just very intriguing to me. People in their early 30s or I think it's mid-30s, 35 years old, they their percentage of uh equities as a percentage of their net worth in this generation. So I guess millennials you can call it 23%. So if you are around 35 in that you know early 30s range, mid-30s range, 23% of your net worth on an aggregate is in equities. For the boomers when they were 35 years old, it was 7%. That is a massive difference, right? And so when you have a stock market with technology stocks that are leading the way, most people 35 and younger, right? Nvidia, Tesla, Amazon, the companies that they actually understand, the companies that they can see the technology in front of their face, those are the companies they're investing in, those are the companies that have gone up, those are the companies that have done well. So when 7% decades ago as a result of your net worth was in equities versus 23% it makes a vast difference on the level of wealth or at least the perception of wealth that people think that they have.</p>
</details>

这就是为什么尽管消费品牌表现不佳，但股市上涨，人们仍然愿意花钱。因为像亚马逊、谷歌、苹果和微软这样的大型科技公司执行力极强，在过去12个月里，它们的总收入达到了创纪录的1.8万亿美元。大多数人将资金配置在这些公司，而不是宝洁或Lululemon。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that is why when you look at a chart like this is all these consumer brands are down but the stock market's up and people are willing to spend even more. It's because these companies are executing at such a high level and they have so much allocation to these companies. Take a look at this. The combined revenues of the big four US tech companies, Amazon, Google, Apple, and Microsoft, hit a record 1.8 trillion over the last 12 months. Amazon at 691 billion, Apple 416, Google 386, Microsoft 294. I'm working on a Substack piece coming out in the next week about how the big tech companies might be the easiest investments of our lifetime. And when you see charts like this and then when you see that most people have allocation to these companies, not Johnson and Johnson or Proctor and Gamble or Lululemon, but rather Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft.</p>

### AI 对劳动力市场的影响

另一个在周末疯传的图表非常重要，它又回到了关于劳动力市场的争论。这张图显示，自2022年11月ChatGPT推出以来，标普500指数一路上扬，而总职位空缺数量却在下降。这让人们开始思考：这个该死的AI会不会让股东变富，却让其他人因为没有工作而变穷？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, there's another chart that's been going quite viral over the weekend that I think is uh pretty important to look at. And, you know, it goes back to this argument about what's going on with the with the labor market. So, take a look at this. Uh S&P 500 in in the black and then chatbt or sorry, total job openings in the blue. Uh CHBT is in the middle right there. November 2022 when it officially launched. As you can see, the S&P 500 is going higher, and for all of us that own assets, we are getting richer. The job market is getting worse, even though employment is still below 5%, which is historically not bad. Uh, but as you can see, total job openings are going down. And as a result, it's one of those things where people are starting to wonder, wait a second, is this damn AI thing going to make shareholders rich, but going to leave everybody else poor because no one's going to have a job, which eventually will hurt shareholders at some point. And I don't know, but based on a chart like this, it seems rather obvious that this is playing out.</p>
</details>

看看亚马逊和微软的员工数量，自2021年以来都在下降。大型科技公司雇佣的员工总数似乎已经达到顶峰。我认为它们未来雇佣的员工数不太可能超过2021年的水平。原因有二：一是在疫情期间过度招聘；二是在AI时代，它们根本不需要那么多人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's another thing right here to take a look at. So, Amazon.com employees, this is from the Wall Street Journal. As you can take a look right there, along with Microsoft is down. Amazon is down from 2021 after the recent round of layoffs, which likely some more layoffs are coming. And then Microsoft is down 6% from the peak. It seems like the total amount of jobs that the big tech companies have used to employ has reached the peak and I think it is very unlikely like I'm just you know just looking at these charts and then anecdotally looking at what's going on in the world of AI it seems very unlikely that the big tech companies are ever going to have more employees than they had back in 2021. Uh for two reasons. Number one they overhired during the pandemic. So that was one thing that contributed to that many new employees. Number two is like they just don't need that many people.</p>
</details>

另一张图表也印证了这一点。如今在加州，科技岗位的占比甚至低于2008年金融危机时期。虽然这背后有比AI更复杂的宏观原因，比如公司迁往德州或外包，但很难否认AI可能在其中扮演了角色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's another chart that exemplifies this. So, this is the ongoing share of uh US tech jobs that are located in California, which is the tech capital of the world. There are fewer tech jobs in California today in 2025 than during the 2008 great financial crisis. Now in 2008 uh the tech companies were just starting right u well not just starting I mean like a lot of them had just IPOed. Google IPOed in 2005. Meta was just you know evolving from a startup. I think it raised the series A back in 2007. So the tech companies were hiring aggressively in 2008. But you would think in 2025 the percentage of US tax jobs in California should be way higher than what it was 17 years ago. And that's not the case. And there's probably more macro arguments to explain that than just AI. But it's hard to undermine the fact that AI could be playing a role right here. And why there's just not that many tech jobs that's needed as a percentage of the overall jobs in California.</p>

### 财报前瞻：Palantir 与 Grab

好了，让我们来谈谈Palantir。明天就是财报日了，我很兴奋。华尔街的盈利预期是10.9亿美元，这基本上就是Palantir给出的指引。分析师们并没有提高预期，他们基本上在赌公司会符合指引。但在过去10个季度里，Palantir每次都超预期并上调指引。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, Palinger, let's talk about it. Let's talk about it. First of all, who's excited? Who's excited? We'll talk about Grab after, but Palanteer is tomorrow. I think this is officially the 18th quarter I'll be covering publicly on the channel. It's kind of crazy, dude. Um, but I am pretty excited for it. Now, the reason I am excited for it is because I looked at the numbers over the weekend. Seeking Alpha that I'm pulling up right here has the earnings estimates and the estimates from Wall Street is 1.09. 9 billion. Pounder basically guided for 1.09 billion. So, uh, the analysts aren't really raising the estimate from the company. They're basically betting that the company is going to come in line with guidance. And they've done this for basically the past 10 quarters. And what has Palanteer done? They've uh beat and raised to such a degree that the analysts completely got it wrong.</p>
</details>

现在的问题是，股价已经先行上涨了。过去几周我一直在170到185美元的区间买入，因为我认为当市场看到50%的增长时，股价会走高。现在这已经发生了。所以，问题变成了财报到底要有多好，才能让股价涨得更高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if they can, I think it's going to be an exciting quarter. Now, what's going to happen to the stock? I have no idea because the stock already made a run. I mean, I really for the past couple weeks, the reason I've been buying pounder around that 170 to 185 range is like, hey, I think when the street sees 50% growth, uh, they're going to be excited and the stock probably makes a move higher. That has already happened. So, the anticipation of the move has already taken place. The question now becomes how good is the quarter going to be to get the move to be even better than what we see right here.</p>
</details>

我认为他们会达到12亿美元的收入，比预期高出1亿美元。如果他们能做到，并且每股收益接近25美分（而不是17美分），增长率接近55%到57%，我认为华尔街会再次惊叹。这是唯一一家增长如此之快的公司，也是唯一一家真正将AI付诸实践并使其有用的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think they're going to come in to 1.2 billion. I think they're going to beat by 100 million. And I think if they beat by a hundred million and we get 1.2 billion and we get closer to 25 cents versus 17 cents, again, I I just like if they grow anywhere near 55 to 57% right now, they're got to get 50%. So they would have to have a little bit of a 7 to 8% beep. I mean, dude, like I Wall Street, I think once again, will say, "Wait a second. This is the only company that's growing as fast as they're growing. This is the only company that's actually implementing AI to make it useful."</p>
</details>

此外，如果他们新增100个客户（这将是首次单季度新增客户数达到三位数），并且新增了更多百万美元级别的大合同，再加上55-57%的营收增长，我认为股价会更高。但我不想让大家的期望太高，因为股价已经涨了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This might be the first quarter where they add 100 customers. They've never added a triple digit number of customers. I think last quarter they added 77. If they add uh 100 and they have more deals of at least a million that was added. I think last quarter they have like 150. If that gets closer to like 175 and they have that topline revenue growth of 55 to 57%. I think the stock can go higher and I think the street will really like it. Now am I expecting that? No. I really want to calm people's expectations down. If the stock was at 170 180, I would be gung-ho of like, hey, I think there's going to be a move. Stock made the move already.</p>

现在谈谈Grab。我对明天的Grab财报很兴奋。我的直觉告诉我，他们会有一个很棒的季度，会超预期并上调指引，EBITDA指引会接近5亿美元，股价会涨到6.8到6.9美元的区间。但理智告诉我，财报在美东时间晚上7:30发布，之后只有30分钟的盘后交易时间，交易量很小，可能不会有大的波动。

<p class="english-text">All right, Grabby Grab. We'll end off the show with Grabby Grab. Um, I'm excited for Grab tomorrow. I posted on my Substack, the deep dive. I disclosed on that Substack. I now have over 40,000 shares. So, your boy's walking in with a pretty heavy bag for uh for this earnings. Look, dude. The thing about Grab, and I've been thinking about this all weekend. I've been thinking about this all weekend. I don't know what's going to happen to the stock. I really don't. My gut, like like like like my gut is telling me they're going to have a great quarter. They're going to beat and raise. Ebida guidance is going to get closer to 500 million and the stock's going to go much higher than where it is today. I'm thinking around that 680 690 range. Maybe it crosses seven. seven might be psychological, but I think we get above 650, but that's what my gut tells me. What my mind tells me is that the earnings come out at 7:30. None of the brokerages care about Grab. There's not a massive retail community. You have 7:30 to 8:00 p.m. in the overnight markets or in the after hours markets that are highly illquid for any massive move to happen up or down. And so, I kind of think that the stock's going to be flat or it's going to be red because there's just not a lot of volume that's going to be coming in because you're going to have 30 minutes to make a move on the stock because the earnings come out at 7:30 and overnight markets close at or overnight markets open at 800 p.m., but after hours close at 8 p.m. and grabbers and trade in the overnight markets.</p>

最终，如果财报很糟糕，我会坦率承认。如果财报很好但股价不动，我也会直说，我长期持有这只股票，我相信它，财报很好，股价不动我无能为力。除非出现明显的危险信号，否则我不会质疑我的投资逻辑。到目前为止，Grab还没有给我任何理由去质疑。

<p class="english-text">If the earnings suck, I will I will open the show by saying, look, I thought the earnings sucked, and I don't think the stock deserves to get a move. If the earnings don't suck and the stock still doesn't make a move, I will flat out say I own this stock long. I believe in it long. The earnings were good. The stock's not moving. I cannot do anything about that. There has to be a glaring red flag for me to see the disconnect between the stock price and the actual opportunity. And so far, Grab hasn't given me a reason. But we're going to see on the earnings and uh if that reason can continue.</p>

<p class="english-text">That's what we got, folks. That's what we got. It's going to be an exciting exciting day tomorrow. And Sam says, "Imagine $10." Dude, if we pump to 10 bucks by the end of the year on Grab, I just I I can't find that realistic, dude. Even if like we pump to like 750, which I think is possible, but to see that actually happen would be amazing. Anything above that to me would be like aggressive unless the company, you know, puts out an earnings that warrants that level of aggression. So, it'll be exciting. It will be exciting. November is officially starting. I got the almond cissant. It's going to be a great month. Almond croissant. And I will see you guys tomorrow morning. Love you all. Thank you everybody. See you guys tomorrow for the market open. Bye everyone. Have a good one.</p>
