### 十一月市场开局：热点事件纷至沓来

大家好，欢迎回到新一期的周日市场期货节目。我们提前三分钟开始了直播，因为我已经准备就绪，所以觉得不如早点开始。感谢大家的到来，希望各位度过了一个愉快的周末。朋友们，十一月已经正式开始了，这感觉有点疯狂。2025年只剩下两个月了，今天是11月2日。今年过得真快。十月份的股市跌宕起伏，上周我们讨论了美联储和大型科技公司财报等大量事件，但十月已经结束，我们迎来了新的月份。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the Sunday market futures. We are live. We are three minutes early. I was like, you know what? I'm ready to go. we might as well get started. And we are here. Thank everybody for being here. Hope everyone had a great weekend. We've got November officially starting, folks. It's kind of crazy. It really is kind of crazy. We got two months left of 2025. It is November 2nd. This year has gone relatively quick. I mean, October was up and down in regards to the stock market. We had a ton of stuff to cover last week with the Fed and big tech earnings, but October is done and we're here. We are live.</p>
</details>

我们有很多内容要谈。这个周末，有很多新访谈在网上疯传，特别是围绕 Sam Altman 和 Satya Nadella 的。所以我们会讨论一下。特朗普正在接受哥伦比亚广播公司（CBS）的《60分钟》特别访谈，因此在整个节目过程中，可能会不断有新的言论爆出。实际上，我们已经开始看到一些言论了，已经有几个采访片段流出。所以在接下来的一个小时里，你可能会听到很多不同的引述，我会把它们显示在屏幕上，并分析当前的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We got a lot to talk about. We have a bunch of different things that went viral over the weekend in regards to new interviews, particularly around Sam Alman and Satia Nadella. So, we're going to talk about that. We got Trump who's doing a CBS 60inut special interview right now. So, there's likely going to be a ton of quotes coming in throughout the course of this market future show. I mean, we're already getting quotes right now. We have a couple of clips already from the interview. So throughout the entire hour, you're probably going to get a bunch of different quotes and I will put them on the screen and we'll analyze what's going on.</p>
</details>

特朗普大约五分钟前发推文说，如果不实施关税，我们将变成一个第三世界国家。最高法院本周将审理关税案，所以这将非常重要。我们会谈到这一点。然后我们还有巴菲特的一些最新消息，他的伯克希尔哈撒韦公司公布了财报。这是沃伦·巴菲特和伯克希尔哈撒韦公司有史以来最后一个第三季度财报。所以我们会讨论他们的一些举措。我们还有一系列不同的宏观数据和图表需要关注，以预测十一月份的走势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Trump already tweeted like five minutes ago that we will be a third world country without the tariffs going into effect. The Supreme Court will be looking at the tariffs case this week. So that's going to be really important. So we'll talk about that. And then we got some updates from Buffett. He had earnings with Bergkshire Hathway. This is the last Q3 ever for Warren Buffett and Birkshshire Hathway. So we'll talk about some of the stuff they did. We have a bunch of different macro stats to look at, some charts in regards to what to expect in November.</p>
</details>

明天，Palantir 将公布财报。所以我们会对此做一个简短的预告。今天是名副其实的“Palantir前夜”。这应该是我为 Palantir 做的第18个季度的财报分析了，真是疯狂。而且坦白说，这可能是最好的一个季度。我们也会谈到 Grab。所以，这将是内容极其丰富的一周。明天有 Palantir 和 Grab 的财报，绝对会非常疯狂，我们会对即将发生的事情做一个预告。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then tomorrow, you've got Palunteer earnings. So, we're going to do a little bit of a preview on that. It is indeed happy Palunteer Eve. This is what this is the 18th quarter I've covered for Pounder. Just kind of crazy. And quite frankly, it might be the best quarter. So, we're going to talk about that. And then we got Grabby Grab as well. So, I mean, this is going to be a jam-packed week. Tomorrow is going to be absolutely insane with Palunteer and Grab, and we'll do a preview on what's going on with that.</p>
</details>

### 深度研究分享：Nebius 与 Grab

在我们开始之前，我发布了两篇新的深度分析文章，分别是关于 Nebius 和 Grab 的。Grab 这家公司，我大约三个月前写了一份17页的深度报告。这个周末我完善了这份报告，并正式发布在了 Substack 上。链接就在那里，大家可以去看看，免费订阅，没有付费墙。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But, we have a lot a lot a lot to talk about. So, thank you everybody for being here. Before we get started, deep dives are out. Two new deep dives. We have Nebas and Grabby. Grab is a company that I did a 17page deep dive on about three months ago. I refined the deep dive over the weekend and I officially published it on Substack. And so there's the link right there. You guys can check it out. Free to subscribe. No payw wall, anything like that.</p>
</details>

很多人一直在问关于 Nebius 的分析。我研究了 Nebius，明天可能会更详细地谈谈，或者如果大家有问题，我们可以在节目最后讨论。坦白说，很难不看好 Nebius，原因很简单，它提供了一种全栈集成的数据中心解决方案。我认为那些在股价20美元时就理解了这个论点的看涨者，已经获得了丰厚的回报。显然，我当时没有理解这个逻辑，也没有真正关注它。在 Substack 文章的前半部分，大约前八段，我谈到了我可能错过这个投资机会的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then Nebius, a lot of people were asking for it. And I looked at Nebas and I'll talk about it more tomorrow. Maybe we can talk about at the end of the show if people have some questions. Look, it is really hard to not be bullish on Nebus Nebius from the simple perspective that it is a full stack integrated approach to data centers. And I think the bulls that understood that argument back when it was $20 have been supremely rewarded for it. I obviously did not understand that thesis, nor did I really pay attention to it. And then the first half of the the Substack or I guess the first kind of like eight paragraphs of the article, I talk about why I likely missed the story.</p>
</details>

但在130美元的价位，我计算了一下，数据都在 Substack 文章里，其实并没有那么可怕。当然，他们能否再获得一个超大规模云服务商的合同存在很大的执行风险。但在94美元时，这确实是一个很好的买入点，可惜我当时只是卖出了看跌期权。不过说实话，在130美元时，情况也并不可怕。最大的风险在于执行力。但我确实认为这家公司有护城河。这是我一直以来对 Nebius 最关心的问题：他们是否有护城河，还是只是又一个数据中心公司？我认为他们有。因此，这很令人兴奋。我还没有持仓，我在文章中解释了原因，但它已经进入我2026年的观察名单，我们会看看后续发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But at 130, look, I did the numbers. The numbers are in the in the substack. It's not that scary. It really isn't. Now, there is a large execution risk on if they can get another hyperscaler deal, but I mean at 94 it was a really good buy and unfortunately I just sold puts on it. But at 130, honestly, it's not that scary. The execution is the biggest risk. But I do think the company has a moat. And I think that's the biggest thing I've been concerned about, Neb, is like, do they have a moat or are they just another data center plate? I think they have a moat. And as a result, it's exciting. So, I don't have a position yet. I talk about why I don't have a position in the article, but it is on my list for 2026, and we're going to see what goes on from there.</p>
</details>

### 市场开盘：中美协议提振市场情绪

好了，我们开始吧。感谢大家的到来。再过14分钟，隔夜市场就要开盘了，我们会看看情况如何。首先，对于那些还没看到的人来说，我认为我们将以相对上涨的态势开盘。我们上涨了0.3%。特朗普已经确认中美之间达成了一项协议，所以我们将讨论这项协议的具体情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, let's get started. Thank you everybody for being here. In 14 minutes, we are going to get the overnight markets to open and we're going to see what happens in overnight. futures. First of all, for those that haven't seen it, I think we're going to open up relatively green. We are up 0.3%. Trump has confirmed there is a USChina deal and so we'll talk about what's going on with the US China deal.</p>
</details>

期货市场是绿色的。特朗普确认中美之间应该会有一项协议正在进行中。我不确定中国方面是否已经确认有正式的协议，我认为这就是我们目前上涨的原因。但一旦隔夜市场开盘，我们会得到更多细节，并进行讨论。我们有一些关于劳动力市场的新图表，这也很重要。过去几周我们一直在讨论劳动力市场。我们关注的重点是上周的裁员数量，特别是亚马逊裁员3万人。所以我们会讨论这一点及其对劳动力市场的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, futures are green. Trump confirmed there should be a China deal going on. I don't know if China has confirmed that there is an official China deal and that's why I think we are green, but we're going to get some details on that uh once the overnight markets open and we'll talk about that. We have some new charts on the labor market. That's also really important to look at. We've been talking a lot about the labor market over the past couple weeks. The biggest thing that we looked at was the amount of layoffs that we had last week, especially with Amazon with those 30,000 layoffs. So, we're going to talk about that and some implications on the labor market.</p>
</details>

但总的来说，我认为我们隔夜市场上涨的原因是，特朗普和中国之间的关系似乎出现了一些稳定。他们在周四会面，这在周五提振了市场。十月份我们连续第六个月收涨，当月上涨了2.4%。通常情况下，十一月市场表现也相对不错。十月份有些波动。比特币和以太坊在十月份表现不佳，也许十一月情况会有所改变，如果真是这样，那将是利好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But overall, I think the reason we're green right now overnight is because it looks like there's some some stability between Trump and China. again they met back on Thursday and that helped the markets on Friday. We did close green for the sixth month in a row in October. So we closed out October up 2.4% for the month. Um and then overall, you know, November is relatively green usually and so we had a bit of a choppy October. Bitcoin and Ethereum kind of sucked in October. Maybe that changes for November and if that does that would be bullish.</p>
</details>

现在以太坊有了一些提振，一度冲向4000美元，现在回落到3883美元。比特币也一度突破11万美元，而上周某个时候还只有10.4万美元。所以，如果说有哪个月份比特币和以太坊会表现出色，那很可能就是十一月，因为比特币在十一月的表现通常比十月要好一些。但随着月底的临近，我们将拭目以待。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now Ethereum is getting a little bit of a boost. It was pushing 4,000. Now it's back to 38.83. Bitcoin as well pushing above 110. It was at 104 at one point last week. So, I mean, I think if there was any month for Bitcoin and Ethereum to do well, it would be November, as Bitcoin actually tends to do a little bit better in November than October. But, we're going to see how these turn out as we get into the end of the month.</p>
</details>

### OpenAI 万亿支出承诺引发争议

好了，大约12分钟后，隔夜市场就要开盘了，之后我们会讨论所有我准备好的话题。在此之前，我们先来看看这个视频，因为它已经彻底火了。Sam Altman 和 Satya Nadella 一起上了 Brad Gersonner 的播客，Brad Gersonner 问了一个相对简单的问题，他说：“我一直听说你们有130亿美元的收入，但你们承诺要花费1.4万亿美元。我想我们每个人每天都在质疑，如果 OpenAI 最终无法兑现这些支出承诺，这会不会是一个会破裂的泡沫？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so in about 12 minutes, we are going to have the overnight markets open and then we'll get into all the topics I've lined up after the overnight markets open. Before that, let's just take a look at this video because it has absolutely gone viral. Sam Alman was on the Brad Gersonner podcast with Satia Nadella and Brad Gersonner asked a relatively simple question which is hey I keep hearing you have 13 billion in revenue but you've committed to spend 1.4 trillion I think every day all of us question could this be a bubble that explodes if open AAI isn't able to officially spend on these commitments that they've committed to spend on and here is what Mr. Sam Alman had to say to that question.</p>
</details>

Brad Gersonner 问道：“一家年收入130亿美元的公司，如何能做出1.4万亿美元的支出承诺？你也听到了那些批评的声音。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> How, you know, how can a company with 13 billion in revenues make 1.4 trillion of spend commitments? You know, and and and you've heard the criticism.</p>
</details>

Sam Altman 回答说：“首先，我们的收入远不止那个数。其次，Brad，如果你想卖掉你的股份，我会帮你找个买家。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> First of all, we're doing well more revenue than that. Second of all, Brad, if you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer.</p>
</details>

Brad Gersonner 补充道：“我想有很多人都想买 OpenAI 的股票。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I just enough like, you know, people are I I think there's a lot of people who would love to buy OpenAI shares. I don't I don't think you want,</p>
</details>

Sam Altman 继续说：“包括我自己。那些对我们的计算能力等问题忧心忡忡的人，其实会很乐意购买我们的股票。所以我想我们可以很快就把你的或者其他任何人的股份卖给那些在 Twitter 上对此大声嚷嚷的人。我们确实计划让收入急剧增长，而且收入也正在急剧增长。我们正在做一个前瞻性的赌注，即它将继续增长，不仅 ChatGPT 会持续增长，我们还将成为重要的人工智能云之一，我们的消费设备业务也将成为一项重要业务，能够自动化科学研究的人工智能将创造巨大价值。所以，虽然我很少想成为一家上市公司，但有一个难得的吸引人的时刻，就是当那些人写着‘OpenAI 即将倒闭’之类的荒谬言论时。我很想告诉他们，他们可以直接做空我们的股票，我很乐意看到他们因此被烧得体无完肤。但我们是经过仔细规划的，我们了解技术和能力将如何发展，以及我们能围绕这些构建什么样的产品并产生收入。我们可能会搞砸，这是我们正在下的赌注，并为此承担了一定的风险。一个确定的风险是，如果我们没有足够的计算能力，我们将无法产生收入或制造出这种规模的模型。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> including myself. including myself who talk with a lot of like breathless concern about our comput stuff or whatever that would be thrilled to buy shares. So I think we we could sell you know your shares or anybody else's to some of the people who are making the most noise on Twitter whatever about this very quickly. We do plan for revenue to grow steeply. Revenue is growing steeply. We are taking a forward bet that it's going to continue to grow grow and that not only will chache keep growing but we will be able to become one of the important AI clouds that our consumer device business will be a significant and important thing that AI that can automate science will create huge value. So, you know, there are not many times that I want to be a public company, but one of the rare times it's appealing is when those people are writing these ridiculous open AI is about to go out of business and you know, whatever. I would love to tell them they could just short the stock and I would love to see them get burned on that. Um, but you know, I we carefully plan, we understand where the technology, where the capability is going to grow, go and and how the products we can build around that and the revenue we can generate. we might screw it up like this is the bet that we're making and we're taking a risk along with that. A certain risk is if we don't have the compute, we will not be able to generate the revenue or make the models at these at this kind of scale.</p>
</details>

Satya Nadella 补充道：“Brad，作为合作伙伴和投资者，我只想说一件事。我所见过的 OpenAI 提出的每一个商业计划，他们不仅完成了，而且都超额完成了。所以在某种程度上，在增长和业务方面，他们的执行力简直令人难以置信。坦白说，大家都谈论 OpenAI 在使用率等方面的成功，但我想说，总的来看，他们的商业执行力也同样令人惊叹。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> let me just say one thing uh Brad as both a partner and um an investor there is not been a single business plan that I've seen from OpenAI that they have put in and not beaten it. So in some sense this is the one place where you know in terms of their growth and just even the business it's been unbelievable execution quite frankly I mean obviously openai everyone talks about all the success in the usage and what have you but even um I would say all up uh the business execution has been just pretty unbelievable.</p>
</details>

这个片段之所以在周末如此火爆，原因有几点。当我看到时，我也相当惊讶。首先，这是一个合理的问题。博通、甲骨文、AMD、英伟达——《华尔街日报》上周有篇文章指出，仅仅因为宣布了与英伟达的交易承诺，这些公司的市值就增加了6300亿美元。我知道 AMD 有庞大的散户军团，但那只股票之所以能涨到250美元，唯一的原因就是这个 OpenAI 的交易。就是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, so the reason that went so viral over the weekend, we got about nine minutes till the overnight markets open and uh then we'll get into all the other topics. But the reason that went viral and when I saw it, I was quite surprised as well is number one, it's a legit question. Okay, Broadcom, Oracle, AMD, Nvidia, there was an article last week from the Wall Street Journal have gained 630 billion in market cap just from the announcements of the deals that they have uh committed to Nvidia. I mean AMD probably will be stuck at $158 a share for everyone. I know there's a big retail army in AMD. The o the literal only reason that stock is at 250 is because of this opening eye deal. That's it.</p>
</details>

如果有人有不同看法，请告诉我。但这正是让股价突破的原因。我这么说不是要贬低那笔交易的重要性，而是要强调这笔交易以及 OpenAI 承诺的支出对于将 AMD 的市值推向4000亿美元，或将甲骨文推向8000亿美元是何等重要。所以，当 Brad Gersonner——顺便说一句，他是过去两年里最大的投资者之一，早在2023年就参与了 OpenAI 的私募轮，对公司非常了解——问你一个非常简单的问题时，他基本上是在给你送分，而不是想刁难你。这个人持有你大量的股票，他为什么要让你难堪呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if someone else has a different reason, let me know. But that was the reason that got the stock to break out. So it is so and the reason is not to downplay the significance of that deal. It's rather to un to underwrite how important the deal is and the spending commitments that are necessary to get AMD to that $400 billion market cap or to get Oracle to that $800 billion market cap which is pledged from OpenAI. So when Brad Gersonner who by the way is one of the bigger investors from the previous two years he was early in 2023 in the private rounds of OpenAI so he knows the company very well. When your biggest supporter is asking you a very simple question he's basically giving you a layup. He's not trying to give you a gotcha question. this guy has a ton of your stock. Why would he be trying to make you look bad?</p>
</details>

他是在给你一个机会，让你简单地说：很多人以为我们年收入130亿美元，实际上我们远不止于此——他这么说也不会是撒谎，我估计实际收入接近250亿美元。第二，我们预计到2027年，收入可能会达到三位数，也就是大约1000亿美元。Sam Altman 后来在播客中也提到了这一点，但他用一种有点自负的方式说的。他本可以就事论事地回答这个问题，比如：“我们预计，虽然不确定能否实现，但到2027年我们可能达到1000亿美元的收入。” 这就使得1.4万亿美元的支出——仅仅是他们届时收入的14倍——听起来不像相对于130亿美元年收入那样疯狂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He's trying to give you the opportunity to simply say this is if obviously I'm all I would be like look a lot of people think we're doing 13 billion in revenue. We are doing significantly more than that which he wouldn't be lying about. I think the estimate is closer to 25 billion in revenue. Number two, our estimates are that by 2027 we're probably going to be hitting triple digits. So about 100 billion in revenue, which Sam Alman mentions a little bit later in the podcast, but he does it in kind of like a an egotistic way, right? He makes like he he kind of says it he says it in a way that's bragging when in reality he could have just answered the question be like look we're projecting we don't know if it's going to happen but we think by 2027 we could get to 100 billion revenue which makes the 1.4 4 trillion spend, which is only about 14 times the amount of revenue they're they're bringing in. Not look as crazy as the $1 13 billion annual run rate.</p>
</details>

然后他本可以说：“让别人说去吧。我们有像你 Brad 这样了不起的人支持我们，有像 Satya、Jensen 和 Lisa Su 这样了不起的人支持我们。正因为有这些非常聪明的人支持我们公司和我们的成长，我们非常有信心能够兑现我们公开承诺的支出。” 就这样，他只需要说这些。这对他来说简直是轻而易举，既能称赞所有信任他公司会成功的人，又能回馈他们的信任，说因为他们如此相信我们，我们才如此兴奋地继续这段旅程。这样事情就结束了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then he could have said, you know, let people say whatever they want to say. We have amazing people like you, Brad, that support us. We have amazing people like Satia and Jensen and Lisa Sue that support us. And because we have all these really smart people supporting our company and our growth, we are very confident that we're going to be able to commit to the spending that we have said that we're going to commit to publicly. That's it. That's all you have to say. That's literally all he It was such a layup for him to give a compliment to all the people that are trusting that his company's going to succeed. He could give them a compliment back and say because they believe in us so much, you know, we're so excited to continue working on this journey. And that would have been the end of it.</p>
</details>

但他却变成了一个自恋狂，说什么“我真希望我们是上市公司，这样我就可以叫人去做空股票了”。他想模仿 Alex Karp 的风格，但问题是，Karp 之所以是 Karp 是有原因的。很少有人能模仿 Karp 的做法而依然显得有魅力。大多数尝试这么做的人只会显得像个混蛋。而他最终就是这样。所以我认为这是一个奇怪的回应，反应过度了。你能看出来 Gersonner 都被他搞得措手不及。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Instead, he turns into this like narcissistic, oh, I wish we were a public company so I could tell people to short the stock. He tried to pull a Karp moment and it's like there's a reason Karp is Karp. Very few people can emulate what Karp does and still be relatively charismatic. Most people that try to do that are not going to be charismatic. They're going to just seem like dicks. And uh you know that's that's what he ended up doing. So I thought it was a a weird response. I think it was overly defensive. You could tell Gersonner was taken back for it.</p>
</details>

Gersonner 后来在推特上公开评论说：“我觉得 Sam 因为这个受到了太多抨击。” 但从大局来看，这事重要吗？不重要。但说到底，如果 Sam 对他最大的支持者之一，也就是 Brad Gersonner，都这样，我很好奇他对别人会怎么样。这确实是那种让你深思的事情，思考这一切是如何发展的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and Gersner you know publicly commented on Twitter. He was like I think Sam is getting too much flack for that. I mean look in the grand scheme of things is this going to matter? No. But like at the end of the day, if Sam is acting like that to one of his biggest supporters, aka Brad Gersonner, I wonder how he acts to other people, you know? I really do. And and it's one of those things where it really makes you think in terms of how this is playing out.</p>
</details>

### OpenAI：AI 市场的“大到不能倒”

Gersonner 试图为他辩护，说人们的解读是“我太好斗了”，他们还为此笑了。我说，当然。但在一个每家 AI 公司都依赖 OpenAI 的时代，这就是一个悖论。即使你讨厌 Sam Altman，即使那个片段让你非常生气，即使你觉得这家伙油滑，不想和他有任何瓜葛，但如果你投资了这个市场，你就必须相信 OpenAI 会赢。就这么简单。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So again, Gersonner tried to defend him right here, saying that people are reading it to say I'm being too feisty. We laughed about it. I'm like, sure, but in in an age where every single AI company is depending on this company, OpenAI, which is the catch 22. It's like even if you hate Sam Alman, even if that clip pissed you off so much, even if you think this guy is squirmy and you just want nothing to do with him, if you are invested in this market, you have to believe OpenAI is going to win. It is just that simple.</p>
</details>

我很想听听任何人的分析，告诉我 OpenAI 可以输，而 AI 牛市还能继续。因为我看过数据，我正在写一篇关于这个的 Substack 文章，下周会发布。这根本不可能。OpenAI 基本上是“大到不能倒”，就这么简单。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I would love any analysis from someone telling me that OpenAI can lose and the AI bull market can continue because I've looked at the numbers. I'm working on a Substack piece about this coming out next week and it it there is no way OpenAI essentially they're too big to fail. It's just that simple. They're too big to fail given this.</p>
</details>

你可能会说，“哦，那 XAI 和 Gemini 呢？” 当然。但 AMD 市值达到4000亿美元是因为 OpenAI。Oracle 冲向七八千亿美元也是因为 OpenAI。Nvidia 市值能增加到现在的水平，在某种程度上也是因为 OpenAI。所以说到底，除非像 Gemini 或 XAI 这样的公司能大规模超越 ChatGPT 每周8亿的活跃用户，否则 OpenAI 似乎太大了。因此，他们必须赢。所以如果你投资了 AI 生态系统，你就得支持他们成功。但运营这家伙的人，从他回答问题的方式来看，显然不是最有魅力的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And you can say, "Oh, well, what about XAI Gemini?" Sure. But the reason AMD is at a $400 billion market cap is because of OpenAI. The reason Oracle is pushing 700 800 billion is because of OpenAI. The reason Nvidia to an extent has added the level of market cap that's added is because of OpenAI. So, at the end of the day, it's like unless a company like Gemini or or uh XAI massively overtake the 800 million weekly activives that CHABT has, feels like opening eye is too big. And as a result, they kind of have to win. So you kind of have to root for their success if you're invested in the AI ecosystem. But the guy who's running it is obviously not the most charismatic in terms of how we answer that question.</p>

不过，他在采访后期确实说了一件事，我们稍后会听听其他部分，那就是他们有望在2027年前实现1000亿美元的收入，这是件大事。我认为这改变了很多人的预期。如果他们对这1000亿美元的预测是保守的，实际上可能会达到2000亿左右，那么 OpenAI 5000亿美元的估值可能就显得低估了。到那时，它的市销率只有5倍，这很便宜。如果是这样，那么未来几年 OpenAI 很可能会获得更多发展动力。

<p class="english-text">The one thing he did say though later in the interview and we'll listen to some other parts of it in a bit is uh that we are on track to get 100 billion of revenue by 2027 which is a big deal. Uh I think that changed a lot of estimates. If they're underounting that 100 billion and it's actually going to be like 200 billion something like that. It really makes OpenAI at 500 billion probably look undervalued. At that point it's trading at 5x sales which is cheap. And you know, if that's the case, then you're likely going to get some more momentum out of OpenAI over the coming years.</p>

### 隔夜市场动态与特朗普言论

好了，市场开盘前3分钟。感谢大家的到来。隔夜市场开盘后我们还有很多要谈。我认为我们会看到一些大的波动，但标普期货上涨了0.3%，所以没什么太疯狂的预期。比特币和以太坊试图有所动作，但幅度不大。所以我们将在接下来的两分钟里看看市场如何开盘。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, that's what we got. All right, 3 minutes until the market opens. Thank you everybody for being here. We got a lot to talk about after these overnight markets. I think we're going to get some big moves up and down, but S&P's up.3% in the future, so there's nothing too crazy to expect. Uh, Bitcoin Ethereum tried to make a little bit of a move, but you know, they're not making too much move. So, we're going to see in the next two minutes how this market opens.</p>
</details>

特朗普刚刚结束了他的 CBS 采访，所以我会给你们一些采访的引述。我不能播放任何片段，因为 CBS 在版权方面非常严格，但我会给你们一些关于特朗普最新言论的数据，他谈了很多关于中国的话题，所以市场可能正在消化更多地缘政治稳定而非不稳定的因素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Trump just finished his CBS interview, so I'll get you some quotes from the interview. I can't play any clips because CBS is like really strong on the copyright, but I'll get you some data on uh the new quotes that we have from Trump, he talked a lot about China, and so the markets could be pricing in a little bit more of geopolitical stability versus instability.</p>
</details>

关于中国，说实话，十一月最重要的事情甚至不是隔夜市场即将开盘，不是巴菲特的现金储备，不是 OpenAI，也不是英伟达。真正重要的是，我们迎来了十一月的全新开端。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In regards to China as well, honestly, the most important thing about November, it's not even really that the overnight markets are about to open. It's not Buffett's cash pile. It's not uh it's not OpenAI. It's not Nvidia. It's it's really not anything other than the fact that we have a new candle for November, folks.</p>
</details>

十一月的隔夜市场正式开盘了。顺便说一下，如果对很多人来说我迟到了，很抱歉。美国实行了夏令时，我知道这会打乱世界上很多国际地区朋友的时间。所以现在我们每周日都会在这个时间正式开始。标普指数上涨0.7%至684。我们看到了一个上涨的标普。SoFi 也上涨了约0.74%。AMD 上涨1.12%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Overnight markets for November are officially open. Here we go. By the way, sorry if I'm late for a lot of people. We had daylight savings in the United States. I know that kind of messes up the time for a bunch of people in the uh the international parts of the world, but yeah. So now we will officially be starting every Sunday at this time for you guys. S&P that's up 7% 684. We got a green S&P. SoFi is up about 74% as well. AMD that's up 1.12%.</p>
</details>

Palantir 203，上涨1.2%。我们会做一个简短的 Palantir 预览。英伟达上涨0.7%。我很高兴看到英伟达上涨了近1%，因为特朗普在 CBS 的采访中说，“我和 Jensen 谈过了”，他基本上是说他们都同意 Blackwell 芯片不应该卖给我们最大的竞争对手。我不知道 Jensen 是否同意这一点。我也不确定这对 Blackwell 芯片意味着什么，而且我绝对不认为我们短期内能从中国获得收入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Palunteer 203 that's up 1.2%. We will do a little bit of a pounder preview. Nvidia, that's up n7%. Now, I'm happy that Nvidia is up almost 1% because Trump did say in that CBS interview that um I talked to Jensen and essentially he said that we agreed that Blackwell should not be going well, he agreed. I don't know if Jensen agreed that Blackwell should not be going to our biggest competitors. I don't know what that necessarily means for Blackwell chips and I definitely don't think we're getting China revenue anytime soon.</p>
</details>

Jensen 还有另一个采访，我们稍后也会看看。但是，特朗普确实暗示，Blackwell 可能短期内不会进入中国。所以，英伟达股价实际上涨了而不是跌了，我认为这是个好现象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jensen did have another interview that will look at it. well in a little bit. But, uh, Trump did kind of signal that, you know, maybe Blackwell is not going to be going to China anytime soon. So, the fact that Nvidia is actually up and not going down on that, I think is nice to see.</p>
</details>

### 英伟达在中美关系中的微妙处境

好了，我们开始吧。我认为我们应该从 Jensen 的采访开始，因为它可能为我们接下来要讨论的很多事情定下了基调。这是 Jensen 今天早上在福克斯新闻上的采访，这是他关于中国、特朗普以及当前局势的全部言论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, cool. So, let's get into it. I think we'll start off with uh this Jensen interview because this probably frames a lot of stuff that we got to talk about. So this was Jensen. He was on Fox this morning and this is everything that he had to say about China, Trump, what's going on.</p>
</details>

Jensen Huang 谈到：“首先，人工智能是一场工业革命，这是我们这个时代最重要的技术，甚至可能是所有时代中最重要的技术。当特朗普总统刚上任时，他希望我们在本土制造这些关键技术。他想让美国再工业化，他希望能源增长，他希望确保美国在人工智能领域处于领先地位。为了做到这一点，我们需要在能源、芯片、构建AI基础设施和工厂方面领先，当然也包括在构建AI模型方面领先，还要在医疗、制造、机器人、科学和工业等各个行业应用AI。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, first of all, AI is a industrial revolution and this is the most important technology of our time, potentially the most important technology of all time. And when President Trump first took office, uh he wanted us to manufacture these critical technologies on shore. He wanted to re-industrialize the United States. He wants to have energy growth. He wants to make sure that United States is a leader in artificial intelligence. And in order to do in order to do so, we need to lead in energy. We need to lead in chips. We need to lead in building AI infrastructures and factories including lead in building AI models of course, but also using AI in all the different applications in various industries from healthcare to manufacturing to robotics to you know science and and industry.</p>
</details>

“他希望在他的政府中实现这一点，而且要以光速进行。所以我告诉他，通过与台积电（TSMC）的合作，我们将在9个月内将制造业带回美国。台积电是美国一个了不起的合作伙伴。还有富士康、纬创、Amcor 和 Spill。我们现在已经能够在美国完全制造出世界上最先进的AI芯片。在亚利桑那州，工人们非常努力，机械工程师、电工、水管工、建筑工人，他们都夜以继日地工作。九个月后，我们现在已经量产了世界上最先进的AI芯片。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So uh he wanted he wanted that uh in his administration and he wanted it at the speed of light and so I told him that we would bring manufacturing back within 9 months with the partnership of TSMC which is an incredible partner for the United States Foxcon Wistron Amcor and Spill we've been able to manufacture now the most advanced AI chip in the world completely in the United States and Arizona the the the the the workers worked incredibly hard the mechanical engineers, the mechanical, the electricians, the plumbers, the construction workers, they all worked around the clock. Nine months later, we're now in volume production of the most advanced AI chip in the world.</p>
</details>

当被问及这对于英伟达在中国的业务意味着什么时，Jensen 说道：“这是一个里程碑式的会议，一个里程碑式的协议，一个历史性的协议。我读到的所有新闻都显示，两位总统之间，以及因此在两国之间，建立了一种尊重和友好的关系。这确实为英伟达创造了条件，我希望我们能重返中国市场进行竞争。在特朗普总统的第一届政府期间，他为美国在技术领域领先定下了完美的基调，并确保美国公司拥有最好和最先的技术，同时让美国科技公司走向世界去竞争和取胜。在过去四年里，本届政府的政策确实适得其反。当特朗普总统离任时，我们在中国这个世界上最重要的市场之一拥有95%的市场份额，而现在英伟达在中国的市场份额是0%。所以现在是时候重置，回到特朗普第45届政府的政策，让美国AI公司能够去中国，在市场上竞争，并能够在全球推广美国的技术标准，这样我们就可以设定全球标准，让世界建立在美国标准之上，从而引领世界。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, what an achievement. This is a milestone meeting, a milestone deal, a historic deal. And the readouts uh from from all the news that I've read uh just the respectful uh the friendly relationship that they've built uh between the two presidents and of course between the two countries. Therefore, uh the the post from Secretary Heg Heath and uh and all the readouts from uh Secretary Bessant have have all been extraordinary. You know, this really creates the conditions I hope uh for Nvidia to be able to go back and compete in market in China. Trump 45 in the in President Trump's first administration. Uh he set the tone perfectly for America to lead in technology and make sure that America American companies have the best and first but for American technology companies to go around the world to compete and win. In the last four years, the administration really set us on a path that really backfired. the policies have really backfired from a 95% market share in in the China market which is one of the most important markets in the world when President Trump left office and video's market share in China is now 0%. And so this is really time and it's a great great opportunity for us to reset back to the Trump 45 policies for the Trump 45 policies where AI American AI companies are able to go around go to China compete for compete in the marketplace and be able to diffuse and and proliferate American technology standards around the world so that we could set global standards so that uh the world is built on on American standards so that we could lead the world. And so I I think uh creates the conditions for us to do that. I hope we're able to to um revert back to the policies of the Trump 45 administration and and um get back get back into the market and compete.</p>
</details>

这是 Jensen 的评论。很多人将其解读为中国市场即将回归。显然，他没有说中国市场会回归，他说的是希望特朗普和习近平的协议能为英伟达带来中国市场的收入，或者说希望英伟达能重新获得中国市场的份额，因为现在他们的市场份额是零。然而，20分钟前，特朗普发表了这样的言论，这就是为什么我对英伟达在隔夜市场上涨感到惊讶。但这就是他关于 Blackwell 芯片的原话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So that was the comment by Jensen. A lot of people interpreted that as China's coming back. Obviously he did not say China's coming back. He's saying hopefully the uh implications of the Trump and Xi deal will lead to China revenue or will will lead to China market share hopefully coming back for Nvidia because right now their market share is zero. And then 20 minutes ago you had this from Trump which is why I was surprised Nvidia is actually up in the overnight markets. But this is exactly what he said about Blackwell.</p>
</details>

特朗普在采访中说：“我经常和他（Jensen）见面，他很棒，这是一家伟大的美国公司，现在是世界上最大的公司。芯片领先十年，新出的 Blackwell 芯片比其他任何芯片都领先十年。但除了说声‘恭喜’，没什么好谈的。不，我们不把那个芯片给别人。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I meet with look he's one of the great geniuses of our time his chips are 10 year years ahead of anybody else's and you know I meet with him all the time he's a great it's a great American company it's now the biggest company in the world uh so what would you like to know is a is really just a brilliant company the chips are 10 years the new blackwell that just came out it's 10 years ahead of every other chip But there's nothing to meet with other than say congratulations. But no, we don't give that chip to other people.</p>
</details>

最后一句话，“我们不把那个芯片给别人。” 所以，也许特朗普这么说只是为了在与中国的谈判中获得更多筹码。但正如你所见，他明确表示，“我们不把那个芯片给别人”，这意味着如果特朗普对英伟达保持类似立场，Blackwell 芯片的收入很可能不会回来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> That last sentence, we don't give that chip to other people. So, look, maybe Trump is just saying that because he wants to get a little bit more of a negotiation on what we get with China. Uh, but as you can see, he clearly said, "We don't give that chip to other people." which means the blackwell chip is likely not coming back in terms of revenue if this is the similar stance that Trump is going to have on Nvidia.</p>
</details>

### 中美贸易协议细节公布

那么，贸易关系到底发生了什么？这是昨晚发布的消息，公布在美国政府官网上，内容如下：中方将暂停新的稀土出口管制，将为稀土出口颁发通用许可证，将采取重大措施阻止芬太尼流入美国，将暂停自3月4日以来的所有报复性关税，暂停自3月4日以来的所有报复性非关税措施，并购买至少1200万公吨的美国大豆。美方将把关税降低10%，从57%降至47%，将301条款关税豁免的有效期延长至2026年11月。这是白宫昨天发布的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now what actually happened with the trade relations? So this came out last night. This was published on the US.gov website and this is exactly what they said. The Chinese are going to suspend new rare earth export controls. They're going to issue general licenses for exports of rare earths. They're going to take significant measures to end the flow of fentinel to the US. They're going to suspend all retaliatory tariffs since March 4th. suspend all retaliatory non-tariff measures since March 4th and purchase at least 12 million metric tonses of US soybeans. The US is going to lower tariffs by 10% from uh 57 to 47, extend the expiration of section 301 tariff exclusions until November 2026 published by the White House yesterday.</p>
</details>

所以，协议中没有任何内容表明中国将正式获得 Blackwell 芯片，但我认为这让市场松了一口气，因为年底可能爆发的大规模贸易战现在看来不会发生了。当然，中方还需要确认这一点，但我认为他们已经购买了一些大豆以示诚意。考虑到上周我们报道的谈判情况，似乎一切都相对平稳，而那种让全球都感到恐慌的稀土出口管制可能不会发生，这或许是个好消息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So nothing in that says that China will officially get Blackwell, but I think it's giving the market a lot of ease now that there's not this massive trade war that might break out towards the end of the year. Obviously, the Chinese have to confirm this, but I think they already bought some soybeans as a sign of good faith. And, you know, given the negotiations that happened last week that we covered, it seems like everything is relatively okay and the export controls on rare earths that kind of really got everyone scared globally might not be happening and as a result, you know, that might be the good thing.</p>

### 美国经济的双速现实：财富效应与消费疲软

现在，为什么理解这一点非常重要？好吧，我马上要展示一些东西，对于那些没有看过这些汇总数据的人来说，看一看真的非常非常重要。看看这个，这些是一些非常重要的消费类股票年初至今的回报率。Chipotle，我们上周都看到了他们财报的情况，CEO 亲口说，年收入低于10万美元、年龄在25到34岁之间的人进店消费的次数减少了。Wendy's 今年下跌了44%，我甚至都不知道是这样。Lululemon 简直是一场灾难，下跌了54%。Whirlpool 下跌了35%，尽管他们的财报不错。Macy's 下跌了27%。Caesars 下跌了38%。Under Armour 下跌了36%。当你看到这些消费类股票时，情况有点难看。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Now, why is that really important to understand? Well, I'm about to show something right here and uh for those that haven't seen this aggregated data, it's actually really really important to to take a look at. So, so take a look at this right here. These are the year-to-ate returns on some very important consumer stocks. Chipotle, we all saw last week what happened with their earnings. The CEO literally said people making less than 100,000 from ages 25 to 34 are not entering the store as much. Wendy's was down 44% this year. I didn't even know that was the case. Lululemon, that's been a train wreck, down 54%. Whirlpool down 35%, although they did have good earnings. Macy's down 27%. Caesars down 38%. Under Arour down 36. I mean, it's a little ugly when you look at these consumer stocks.</p>
</details>

这里有另一张图表显示了更多信息。金宝汤公司、通用磨坊、卡夫亨氏、高露洁、宝洁。这些是全年表现最差的股票。所以这里有两个微妙的观点。第一，这些公司是世界上最好的公司吗？可能不是。我想英伟达、微软、亚马逊、谷歌等的执行力要比宝洁和 Lululemon 好得多。这是第一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's another chart that shows even more. the Camples company, General Mills, Craft Hind, Colgate, uh, Proctor and Gamble. These have been the worst performing stocks of the entire year. So, there's two kind of nuanced points around this. Number one is has has have these companies been the best companies in the world. Probably not. I would imagine Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, etc. are executing a lot better than Proctor and Gamble and and Lululemon. So, that that's the first point.</p>
</details>

但其次，我认为人们开始思考消费者到底怎么了，因为这些都是面向消费者的公司，而且不仅仅是 Chipotle。还有很多其他的快餐品牌。比如 Shake Shack，虽然它不算是低端消费，但它的股价全年都在受挫。而 Shake Shack 在中产阶级消费者中通常表现不错，但现在也不太好了。所以问题是，经济到底怎么了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But second of all, the reason I think people are starting to wonder what's going on with the consumer is because these are consumer oriented companies and it's not just Chipotle. There's a lot of other fast food brands. I mean, Shake Shack, which is, you know, not really for the low end of the consumer, but uh their stock has been hit all year. And, you know, Shakes Shack tends to do relatively well uh even with middle class consumers, that's not been doing that great. So, the question is what's going on in the economy?</p>
</details>

我们作为投资者不能忽视经济中有些部分在2026年表现不佳的事实。必须要有某种程度的转变，要么是这些公司内部的转变，如果这真的只是公司自身的问题。但当你看到像这样的图表时，这些都是消费品牌。而且很多这些消费品牌不是路易威登，它们不是试图以1万美元的价格卖一件衬衫的公司。这些公司销售的是相对便宜的产品，但它们的股价却一直表现不佳。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we as investors cannot ignore that there are factions of the economy that are not doing well in 2026. There's going to have to be some level of turnaround either internally with these companies if it really is just a company thing. But when you look at a chart like this, these are all consumer brands. And a lot of these consumer brands are not Louis Vuitton, you know, these are these are not brands that are trying to sell a shirt for $10,000. These are companies that are selling relatively cheap products that have not been able to get their stock to do well.</p>

### “财富效应”支撑下的市场

这引出了关于**财富效应**（Wealth Effect: 指资产价格上升让人们感觉更富有，从而更愿意消费的经济现象）的讨论。这是本周末《The Compound and Friends》节目中一个两到三分钟的片段，讨论了财富效应这个概念，因为这正是经济看起来还能支撑的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Having said that, this leads into the conversation around the wealth effect. Here is a two to three minute clip from the compound and friends this weekend talking about this idea of the wealth effect because again that is why it looks like the economy is holding up.</p>
</details>

“我想深入探讨一下，因为这是我每周都愿意为之辩护的观点。我是财富效应的忠实信徒。我认为这是经济中最重要的因素，没有之一。它决定了就业，决定了人们是否能加薪，我认为它还决定了**资本支出**（Capital Expenditure: 资本支出，指公司用于购买、维护或升级固定资产的资金）项目。没有什么比股价下跌30%更能迅速阻止AI领域的资本支出了。因此，我认为我们严重低估了股市影响实体经济的能力。现在有比以往任何时候都多的美国人拥有**401k**（401(k) plan: 美国的一种由雇主赞助的退休储蓄计划）。我理解住房对中产阶级来说是更大的资产，等等。这些我都明白。但那些为别人工作的人，他们关心的是自己所在公司的股票期权。我就是认为这是一个巨大的驱动力。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I want to double click on that because like this is the hill that I like to die on every week. I'm a wealth effect truther. I think it's the number one most important factor in the economy, bar none. It decides employment. It decides whether or not people get wage increases. I think it decides capex spending projects. Nothing will halt AI capex in its tracks faster than a stock price that falls 30%. Nothing. And so, as a result, I really think we underpric the ability of the stock market to influence things that happen in the real economy. Um, more Americans than ever are in 401ks. I understand housing is a bigger asset for the middle class, blah blah blah. I get all that. The people that work for people though, those people, they care about their stock options in the companies they work for. I just I think it's a huge driver.</p>
</details>

“福特和通用汽车的股价本周创下52周新高。这背后的故事是什么？是财富效应促使人们去经销商那里购买新的F-150，而不是贸易战的那些破事。这些公司处理这场关税战处理得如此之好，不是因为他们能控制采购物资的价格，而是因为需求从未减弱。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Ford and GM made 52 week highs this week. Yeah. What's the story there? The story there is the wealth effect is what sends people to the dealership to buy a new F-150. Not trade war [ __ ] These companies have handled this tariff war handled this this tariff situation so well, not because they're in control of the prices of of the supplies they buy, but because the demand never let up.</p>
</details>

我认为这是一个非常重要的观点。福特和通用汽车的表现甚至超过了特斯拉。福特基本上在两年高点交易。为什么？因为他们能卖出更多的车。为什么能卖出更多的车？因为人们有更多的钱，不仅仅是因为他们的薪水，还因为他们持有资产。即使只是他们的401k，他们也感觉更富有了。这就是财富效应的整个概念。他们能买更多的车，而且这些车相对比特斯拉便宜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I I and I I think this is a really important point. Ford and GM have out or GM has at least outperformed Tesla this year. Ford's basically trading at a two-year high. Why? They're able to sell more cars. Why are they able to sell more cars? Because people have more money, not just because of their paychecks, but because they're holding on to assets. Even if it's just their 401k, they feel richer. That's the whole concept of the wealth effect. And they're able to buy more cars and those cars are relatively cheaper than a Tesla.</p>
</details>

所以，这就是股市财富效应的力量。我认为这是一个很好的观点，我们不能忽视。节目中还有另一个数据让我非常感兴趣。35岁左右的人，他们净资产中股票的比例是23%。而对于婴儿潮一代，当他们35岁时，这个比例是7%。这是一个巨大的差异，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Um, and so my point is that's the power of the stock market wealth effect. And so, look, I think it's a good point. I think it's something we cannot ignore. And what's really important is another stat from the show that was that was just very intriguing to me. People in their early 30s or I think it's mid-30s, 35 years old, they their percentage of uh equities as a percentage of their net worth in this generation. So I guess millennials you can call it 23%. So if you are around 35 in that you know early 30s range, mid-30s range, 23% of your net worth on an aggregate is in equities. For the boomers when they were 35 years old, it was 7%. That is a massive difference, right?</p>
</details>

所以，当股市由科技股引领时，大多数35岁及以下的人投资的正是英伟达、特斯拉、亚马逊这些他们真正理解的公司，是他们能亲眼看到技术的公司。这些公司股价上涨，表现良好。几十年前，当净资产中只有7%是股票时，与现在的23%相比，人们对财富的感知或至少是感觉，有着天壤之别。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so when you have a stock market with technology stocks that are leading the way, most people 35 and younger, right? Nvidia, Tesla, Amazon, the companies that they actually understand, the companies that they can see the technology in front of their face, those are the companies they're investing in, those are the companies that have gone up, those are the companies that have done well. So when 7% decades ago as a result of your net worth was in equities versus 23% it makes a vast difference on the level of wealth or at least the perception of wealth that people think that they have.</p>

### 十一月市场展望

让我们来看一些关于十一月的图表。十一月通常表现相当不错。看看这个，自1927年以来，标普500指数在59%的十一月份都是收高的。这个比率实际上远高于十月。在这些年份里，该指数平均回报率为1%。纳斯达克100指数平均回报率为2.4%。罗素2000指数为2.64%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's get into some charts about November. So November tends to be pretty damn good. Take a look at this. Since 1927, the S&P 500, uh the S&P 500 has ended higher 59% of November. So 59% of the time you tend to get a higher November that is actually a much higher rate than October. During these years, the index averages an average of one or returned an average of 1%. The NASDAQ 100 has seen 2.4%. The Russell 2000 2.64.</p>
</details>

在美国总统周期的第一年，也就是我们现在所处的2025年，十一月也一直很强劲，标普500指数有67%的时间是上涨的。自1950年以来，当标普500指数在进入十一月时年初至今涨幅超过15%时，它在十一月的平均回报率为2.7%。目前，标普500指数上涨了18%。所以，从历史上看，我们可能会在十一月迎来一个2.5%的月度涨幅，这将使我们远超7000点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In year one of a US presidential cycle, which we are in right now, 25, November has also been strong with the S&P 500 going up about 67% of the time.

So, historically, we could get a two and two two and a half% month going into November, which would put us well over 7,000.</p>
</details>

Tom Lee 仍然认为我们会达到7000点。他确实认为在此之前会有些颠簸。他认为十一月的前两周，涨幅需要消化一下，这是有道理的，因为英伟达的财报在十一月下半月。所以可能需要一些时间，在英伟达的财报结果被市场消化之前。但如果市场出现波动，这很可能是一个逢低买入的机会，就像今年以来一直如此，因为十一月通常表现良好，而且我们很可能会迎来降息。所以，有很多理由对十一月保持乐观，看起来十一月不一定会很糟糕。

<p class="english-text">Tom Lee still thinks we're going to get to 7,000. He does think it's going to be a bit choppy before we get there. The first two weeks of November, he thinks the gains have to kind of settle in, which makes sense because you have Nvidia at the back half of November. So, it might take some time before we end up getting the uh earnings results from Nvidia to bake in, but if it is choppy, it likely is a buy the dip scenario like it has been all year as November tends to do well and as we're probably going to get that rate cut. So, I mean there there there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic around November and it doesn't look like November necessarily has to go bad.</p>

### 特朗普最新采访言论摘要

在我们进入其他话题之前，先来看看特朗普的言论，我正在接收它们。采访者问：“你会提出一个医疗保健计划吗？”特朗普说“不”。采访者说：“自2015年以来，你一直说你会解决它。”特朗普说：“我们差点就做到了。”所以，至少目前还没有医疗保健计划。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Okay, before we get into some other topics, Trump quotes, I'm getting them in right now. So, uh, let me give you guys some of these quotes. Again, we can't play these clips because CBS gets like super aggressive with copyrighting, but uh, interviewer says, "Will you pull forward a healthare plan?" Trump says no. Interviewer says, "Since 2015, you've said you fixed it." Trump said, "We almost did it." So, no plan on healthcare at least yet.</p>
</details>

关于如果最高法院在关税问题上做出对他不利的裁决，特朗普说：“我认为我们的经济会完蛋。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh Trump on if the Supreme Court rules against him on tariffs. He says, "I think our economy will go to hell."</p>
</details>

采访者问：“你为什么赦免了币安的CZ？”特朗普说：“我不知道他是谁。”采访者说：“他的加密货币交易所币安帮助促成了一笔20亿美元的世界自由金融稳定币的购买，然后你赦免了他。”世界自由金融是特朗普子女的代币。特朗普说：“事情是这样的，我对此一无所知。”我真的认为特朗普根本不知道CZ是谁。他只是被告知要赦免他，然后他就说：“好吧，加密货币，酷。这可能就是我们该做的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um interviewer, why did you pardon Binance's CZ? Uh Trump says, "I don't know who he is." Interviewer says his crypto exchange Binance helped facilitate a $2 billion purchase of World Liberty Financial stable coin and then you pardoned him. World Liberty Financial is the Trump uh the Trump uh kids uh coin. Trump says, "Here's the thing. I know nothing about it. I genuinely think Trump has no freaking clue who CZ is. He just he got told to pardon him and he was like, "All right, crypto. Cool. That's probably what we got to do."</p>
</details>

采访者又问：“中国有多大的威胁？”特朗普说：“就像其他所有人一样。我们对他们也是威胁。你说的很多我们对他们做的事，他们也会对我们做。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh interviewer then says, "How big of a threat is China?" Trump says, "It's like everybody else. We're a threat to them, too. Many of the things you say we do to them, they would do to us."</p>
</details>

关于习近平和普京，特朗普说他们都是非常强硬的领导人，是不能掉以轻心的人，必须非常认真地对待他们。他们不是那种走过来说“哦，今天天气真好”的人。他们是严肃的人，强硬的领导人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is the exact transcript from the interview that I'm looking at right here on Xi and Putin. Uh Trump said they're both very strong leaders. These are people not to be toyed with. You have to take them very seriously. They're not walking in saying, "Oh, isn't it a beautiful day?" These are serious people, tough leaders.</p>
</details>

关于第三个任期，采访者问：“你能澄清一下吗？你会竞选第三个任期吗？”特朗普说：“我甚至没想过。但我告诉你，很多人希望我竞选。”特朗普已经更明确地告诉人们他并没有真正考虑第三个任期。所以，我知道有这样的谣言，但我不认为特朗普在认真考虑竞选。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On a third term, interviewer says, "Can you set the record straight? Are you going to run for a third term?" Trump says, "I don't even think about it. I will tell you a lot of people want me to run." Trump's been more explicit about telling people he's like not really thinking about a third term. So, I know that's a rumor that's out there, but I don't think Trump is like seriously thinking of uh of making that run.</p>

### AI 对劳动力市场的影响

有另一张图表在周末也流传甚广，我认为看一下非常重要。它回到了关于劳动力市场现状的争论。看看这个，黑色的是标普500指数，蓝色的是总职位空缺数。中间是ChatGPT于2022年11月正式发布的时间点。如你所见，标普500指数在走高，对于我们这些持有资产的人来说，我们变得更富有了。但就业市场在变差，尽管失业率仍低于5%，这在历史上不算糟糕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, there's another chart that's been going quite viral over the weekend that I think is uh pretty important to look at. And, you know, it goes back to this argument about what's going on with the with the labor market. So, take a look at this. Uh S&P 500 in in the black and then chatbt or sorry, total job openings in the blue. Uh CHBT is in the middle right there. November 2022 when it officially launched. As you can see, the S&P 500 is going higher, and for all of us that own assets, we are getting richer. The job market is getting worse, even though employment is still below 5%, which is historically not bad.</p>
</details>

但如你所见，总职位空缺数在下降。因此，人们开始思考，等等，这个该死的AI会不会让股东们变富，却让其他人变穷，因为没人有工作了？这最终在某个时候也会伤害到股东。我不知道，但根据这样的图表，这似乎是显而易见的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, but as you can see, total job openings are going down. And as a result, it's one of those things where people are starting to wonder, wait a second, is this damn AI thing going to make shareholders rich, but going to leave everybody else poor because no one's going to have a job, which eventually will hurt shareholders at some point. And I don't know, but based on a chart like this, it seems rather obvious that this is playing out.</p>
</details>

这是另一件值得关注的事情。亚马逊公司的员工数量，这是来自《华尔街日报》的数据。如你所见，与微软一样，亚马逊的员工数量自2021年以来有所下降，尤其是在最近一轮裁员之后，而且可能还会有更多裁员。微软的员工数量也从峰值下降了6%。看起来，大型科技公司曾经雇佣的员工总数已经达到了顶峰。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's another thing right here to take a look at. So, Amazon.com employees, this is from the Wall Street Journal. As you can take a look right there, along with Microsoft is down. Amazon is down from 2021 after the recent round of layoffs, which likely some more layoffs are coming. And then Microsoft is down 6% from the peak. It seems like the total amount of jobs that the big tech companies have used to employ has reached the peak.</p>
</details>

我认为，仅仅从这些图表和对AI世界正在发生的事情的观察来看，大型科技公司的员工数量极不可能再超过2021年的水平。原因有二。第一，他们在疫情期间过度招聘。第二，他们根本不需要那么多人了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I think it is very unlikely like I'm just you know just looking at these charts and then anecdotally looking at what's going on in the world of AI it seems very unlikely that the big tech companies are ever going to have more employees than they had back in 2021. Uh for two reasons. Number one they overhired during the pandemic. So that was one thing that contributed to that many new employees. Number two is like they just don't need that many people. They just don't need that many people.</p>
</details>

在AI时代，我很难想象我们还会像历史上那样有那么多的职位空缺，这将是我们所有人都要经历的一个有趣的实验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I don't know in the age of AI, it seems very difficult for me to imagine that we are actually going to have the amount of jobs that we've had open historically and it's going to be an interesting experiment for all of us to kind of play out.</p>

### 关键财报前瞻：Palantir 与 Grab

好了，Palantir，我们来谈谈它。首先，谁感到兴奋？明天就是 Palantir 的财报日。我想这正式是我在这个频道上公开报道的第18个季度了，真是有点疯狂。但我确实很兴奋。我兴奋的原因是，我周末看了数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, Palinger, let's talk about it. Let's talk about it. First of all, who's excited? Who's excited? We'll talk about Grab after, but Palanteer is tomorrow. I think this is officially the 18th quarter I'll be covering publicly on the channel. It's kind of crazy, dude. Um, but I am pretty excited for it. Now, the reason I am excited for it is because I looked at the numbers over the weekend.</p>
</details>

Seeking Alpha 上的盈利预期是10.9亿美元。Palantir 的指引基本上就是10.9亿美元。所以分析师们并没有真正提高公司的预期，他们基本上是在赌公司会符合指引。过去10个季度他们基本上都是这么做的。而 Palantir 做了什么？他们超预期并上调了指引，以至于分析师们完全搞错了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Seeking Alpha that I'm pulling up right here has the earnings estimates and the estimates from Wall Street is 1.09. 9 billion. Pounder basically guided for 1.09 billion. So, uh, the analysts aren't really raising the estimate from the company. They're basically betting that the company is going to come in line with guidance. And they've done this for basically the past 10 quarters. And what has Palanteer done? They've uh beat and raised to such a degree that the analysts completely got it wrong.</p>
</details>

分析师们并没有说，“哦，也许下个季度他们不会超预期和上调指引了。”他们继续低估，这意味着 Palantir 能否再次做到这一点完全取决于他们自己。如果他们能做到，我认为这将是一个激动人心的季度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's not like the analysts have really said, "Oh, well, maybe next quarter they're not going to beat and raise." continue to underestimate, which means it's totally in Palunteer's hands for if they can do the same tomorrow. And if they can, I think it's going to be an exciting quarter.</p>
</details>

现在，股价会怎么样？我不知道，因为股价已经涨了一波了。过去几周，我在170到185美元区间买入 Palantir 的理由是，我认为当华尔街看到50%的增长时，他们会感到兴奋，股价可能会上涨。但这已经发生了。对上涨的预期已经兑现。现在的问题是，这个季度的业绩要好到什么程度，才能让股价涨得比我们现在看到的更高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, what's going to happen to the stock? I have no idea because the stock already made a run. I mean, I really for the past couple weeks, the reason I've been buying pounder around that 170 to 185 range is like, hey, I think when the street sees 50% growth, uh, they're going to be excited and the stock probably makes a move higher. That has already happened. So, the anticipation of the move has already taken place. The question now becomes how good is the quarter going to be to get the move to be even better than what we see right here.</p>
</details>

我认为他们会达到12亿美元的收入。我认为他们会超出预期1亿美元。如果他们超出1亿美元，我们得到12亿美元的收入，每股收益接近25美分而不是17美分，而且他们的增长率接近55%到57%——他们需要达到50%的增长，所以需要有7%到8%的超预期——那么，华尔街会再次说：“等等，这是唯一一家增长如此之快的公司。这是唯一一家真正将AI付诸实践并使其有用的公司。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think they're going to come in to 1.2 billion. I think they're going to beat by 100 million. And I think if they beat by a hundred million and we get 1.2 billion and we get closer to 25 cents versus 17 cents, again, I I just like if they grow anywhere near 55 to 57% right now, they're got to get 50%. So they would have to have a little bit of a 7 to 8% beep. I mean, dude, like I Wall Street, I think once again, will say, "Wait a second. This is the only company that's growing as fast as they're growing. This is the only company that's actually implementing AI to make it useful."</p>
</details>

现在轮到 Grab。我为明天的 Grab 感到兴奋。我在我的 Substack 上发布了深度分析。我在那篇 Substack 上披露，我现在持有超过4万股。所以，我带着一个相当重的仓位迎接这次财报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, Grabby Grab. We'll end off the show with Grabby Grab. Um, I'm excited for Grab tomorrow. I posted on my Substack, the deep dive. I disclosed on that Substack. I now have over 40,000 shares. So, your boy's walking in with a pretty heavy bag for uh for this earnings.</p>
</details>

听着，关于 Grab，我整个周末都在想。我不知道股价会发生什么。我真的不知道。我的直觉告诉我，他们会有一个很棒的季度。他们会超预期并上调指引。**EBITDA**（Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization: 未计利息、税项、折旧及摊销前的利润）指引会接近5亿美元，股价会比现在高得多。我预计会在6.80到6.90美元的区间。也许会突破7美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look, dude. The thing about Grab, and I've been thinking about this all weekend. I've been thinking about this all weekend. I don't know what's going to happen to the stock. I really don't. My gut, like like like like my gut is telling me they're going to have a great quarter. They're going to beat and raise. Ebida guidance is going to get closer to 500 million and the stock's going to go much higher than where it is today. I'm thinking around that 680 690 range. Maybe it crosses seven.</p>
</text>

但这是我的直觉。我的理智告诉我，财报在7:30发布。没有券商关心 Grab。没有庞大的散户社区。从7:30到8:00，在流动性极差的盘后市场，任何大的波动都很难发生。而且这是一家在新加坡时间早上8点发布财报的国际股票。所以，可能在美国都没有足够多的人知道明天有财报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but that's what my gut tells me. What my mind tells me is that the earnings come out at 7:30. None of the brokerages care about Grab. There's not a massive retail community. You have 7:30 to 8:00 p.m. in the overnight markets or in the after hours markets that are highly illquid for any massive move to happen up or down. Uh, and then it's a it's an international stock that's reporting earnings at 8 am Singapore time. So, like there might not be enough people in the United States that even know that the earnings is happening tomorrow.</p>
</details>

所以我有点觉得股价会持平或者下跌，因为成交量不大。你只有30分钟的时间来对股票做出反应，因为财报7:30出来，盘后市场8:00结束，而 Grab 不在隔夜市场交易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, I kind of think that the stock's going to be flat or it's going to be red because there's just not a lot of volume that's going to be coming in because you're going to have 30 minutes to make a move on the stock because the earnings come out at 7:30 and overnight markets close at or overnight markets open at 800 p.m., but after hours close at 8 p.m. and grabbers and trade in the overnight markets.</p>
</details>

最终，关于这只股票，这是我将自己的品牌与内容创作金融游戏联系起来的第三个名字。这真的是最酷的游戏之一，但也有起有落。好处是，你公开地将自己与一个名字联系起来，向世界提出一个论点，说：“嘿，我认为这只股票被低估了，我认为它可以走高。”这个行业的神奇之处在于，如果股价上涨，很多人会为你分析公司的能力感到兴奋，他们会开始尊重你的分析和技巧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ultimately on the stock, this is the third name that I associated my brand with in this content creating finance game. I it's actually, you know, it's it's it's one of the coolest games ever, but it's also with its ups and its downs. The ups are you associate yourself with a name publicly. You put out a thesis out there into the world as a human being and you say, "Hey, I think this stock is undervalued. I think the stock can go higher." And the magical thing about this industry is that if the stock goes higher, a lot of people get excited about the way you can analyze a company and they start to respect your analysis and and your skills on your analysis.</p>
</details>

但是，你不能只是一炮而红。所以，我认为过去几年，除了 Palantir 之外，最重要的事情就是找到了第二个，也就是 Hood。这甚至无关公众对我的看法，而是我内心对自己的看法，能够说：“嘿，你能做到一次，你就能做到两次，也许你能做到三次。”这非常重要。但你确实把自己置于险境，这很可怕，因为“万一你错了呢？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, you cannot be a one-hit wonder. And so I think over the past couple years the the the the most important that has happened outside of Palinger is finding that second one which is hood which really just even forget the public perception of myself the the internal perception of myself being able to say hey you know you can do it once you can do it twice maybe you can do it three times it's really important but you do put you put yourself out there on a limb right and when you're putting yourself out there it's scary because it's like what if you're wrong</p>
</details>

我找到了 Grab。这是我找到的那一个。今年它上涨了25%，所以跑赢了标普500。现在这个季度的问题是，他们能否真正跑赢标普？因为标普上涨了18%。所以如果我们今年收在6美元，标普收在7000点，那么标普将上涨21%，Grab将上涨26%。这是一个不错的领先，5%，但不是一个巨大的领先。所以这就是为什么这个季度必须是一个好季度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I found Grab. That's the one that I found. And that's the And look, it's up 25% this year. So it's beating the S&P 500. The question now for this quarter is can they really outperform the S&P? Because the S&P is at 18%. So if we end out at six this year, you know, S&P ends out at like 7,000. S&P will be up 21%. Grab will be up 26%. It's a it's a decent beat, 5%, but it's not like a substantial beat. So, that's why this quarter's got to be a good one. This quarter's got to be a good one.</p>
</details>

但再说一次，我反复研究了数据。我相信它被低估了。我看了多个**DCF**（Discounted Cash Flow: 现金流折现法，一种评估投资价值的估值方法）模型，我认为公允价值接近9到10美元。我看了机构持仓量，这只股票84%由机构持有。我不理解为什么机构一直在大量买入，而股价却一直低迷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But again, I've gone through the numbers over and over again. I believe it's undervalued. I've looked at multiple DCFs. I think fair value is closer to 910 bucks. I've looked at the institutional volume. This thing is owned by 84% of the institutions. It does not make sense to me for why the institutions have been buying as much uh and for the stock to stay depressed.</p>
</details>

好了，各位，就是这些了。感谢大家的到来。希望大家度过了一个愉快的周日。我们正在进入今年的最后两个月，这有点疯狂。明天市场开盘见。明天是重要的一天，有 Palantir，有 Grab。本周有很多财报。我们将看看这一切如何发展。

再次提醒，关于 Grab 和 Nebius 的两篇深度分析已经发布。关于 BMR 和 Duolingo 的文章也在 Substack 上。如果你还没读过，我真的很喜欢写作的过程。接下来的两篇深度分析将是 Reddit 和 Irenix。所以接下来的两周我会专注于此，希望11月15日能发布。
