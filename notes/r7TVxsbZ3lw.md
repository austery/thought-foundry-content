### 市场开盘：11月伊始，展望未来

大家好，欢迎回到新一期的周日市场期货节目。我们提前三分钟开始了直播，因为我已经准备就绪，所以觉得不妨早点开始。感谢大家的到来，希望各位度过了一个愉快的周末。朋友们，11月已经正式开始了，这感觉有点疯狂。2025年只剩下两个月了，今天是11月2日。今年过得相当快。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the Sunday market futures. We are live. We are three minutes early. I was like, you know what? I'm ready to go. we might as well get started. And we are here. Thank everybody for being here. Hope everyone had a great weekend. We've got November officially starting, folks. It's kind of crazy. It really is kind of crazy. We got two months left of 2025. It is November 2nd. Uh this year has gone relatively quick.</p>
</details>

就股市而言，10月份可谓跌宕起伏。上周我们有很多内容要讨论，包括美联储的动态和大型科技公司的财报。但10月已经结束，我们现在进入了新的月份。我们有很多话题要谈，整个周末有很多不同的事情在网上疯传，特别是关于 Sam Altman 和 Satya Nadella 的新采访，我们稍后会讨论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, October was up and down in regards to the stock market. We had a ton of stuff to cover last week with the Fed and big tech earnings, but October is done and we're here. We are live. We got a lot to talk about. We have a bunch of different things that went viral over the weekend in regards to new interviews, particularly around Sam Alman and Satia Nadella. So, we're going to talk about that.</p>
</details>

此外，特朗普正在接受 CBS《60分钟》的特别采访，所以在我们这个市场期货节目的过程中，可能会有很多他的言论流出。实际上，我们现在已经开始收到一些引述了，已经有几个采访片段。所以在整个小时里，你可能会听到很多不同的引述，我会把它们显示在屏幕上，并分析正在发生的事情。特朗普五分钟前刚发推文说，如果没有关税生效，我们将成为一个第三世界国家。最高法院本周将审理关税案件，所以这将非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, we got Trump who's doing a CBS 60inut special interview right now. So, there's likely going to be a ton of quotes coming in uh throughout the course of this uh market future show. I mean, we're already getting quotes right now. We have a couple of clips already from the interview. So throughout the entire hour, you're probably going to get a bunch of different quotes and I will put them on the screen and we'll analyze what's going on. Trump already tweeted like five minutes ago that we will be a third world country without the tariffs going into effect. The Supreme Court will be looking at the tariffs case this week. So that's going to be really important.</p>
</details>

我们还会谈到巴菲特的一些最新动态，他的伯克希尔·哈撒韦公司公布了财报。这是沃伦·巴菲特和伯克希尔·哈撒韦有史以来最后一个第三季度财报。所以我们会讨论他们的一些举措。我们还有一系列不同的宏观数据和图表要看，以了解11月份可以期待什么。然后，明天 Palantir 将公布财报，所以我们会对此做一个简短的预告。没错，今天是 Palantir 财报前夜。这应该是我为 Palantir 做的第18个季度的报道了，这有点疯狂。坦白说，这可能是最好的一个季度。我们稍后会详细讨论。此外，还有 Grab 的财报。所以，这将是内容非常丰富的一周。明天有 Palantir 和 Grab，绝对会非常疯狂，我们会对即将发生的事情做一个预告。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we'll talk about that. Uh and then we got some updates from Buffett. He had earnings with Bergkshire Hathway. This is the last Q3 ever for Warren Buffett and Birkshshire Hathway. So we'll talk about some of the stuff they did. We have a bunch of different macro stats to look at, some charts in regards to what to expect in November. And then tomorrow, you've got Palunteer earnings. So, we're going to do a little bit of a preview on that. It is indeed happy Palunteer Eve. This is what this is the uh 4812 uh 15. This is I think the 18th quarter I've covered for Pounder. Just kind of crazy. And quite frankly, it might be the best quarter. So, we're going to talk about that. And then we got Grabby Grab as well. So, I mean, this is going to be a jam-packed week. Tomorrow is going to be absolutely insane with Palunteer and Grab, and we'll do a preview on what's going on with that. But, we have a lot a lot a lot to talk about.</p>
</details>

### 市场开盘：特朗普确认中美协议框架

期货市场方面，我认为我们将以相对上涨的态势开盘。我们上涨了0.3%。特朗普已经确认存在一项中美协议，所以我们将讨论这项协议的具体情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um futures. First of all, for those that haven't seen it, I think we're going to open up relatively green. We are up 0.3%. Trump has confirmed there is a USChina deal and so we'll talk about what's going on with the US China deal.</p>
</details>

目前期货市场是绿色的。特朗普确认了中美之间应该会有一项协议。我不知道中方是否已经确认有正式的协议，这可能也是我们市场上涨的原因，但一旦盘前市场开盘，我们会得到更多细节。我们还有一些关于劳动力市场的新图表，这也很重要。过去几周我们一直在讨论劳动力市场，最引人关注的是上周的裁员数量，特别是亚马逊裁员3万人。所以我们会讨论这一点及其对劳动力市场的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, futures are green. Trump confirmed there should be a China deal going on. Uh I don't know if China has confirmed that there is an official China deal and that's why I think we are green, but we're going to get some details on that uh once the overnight markets open and we'll talk about that. We have some new charts on the labor market. That's also really important to look at. We've been talking a lot about the labor market over the past couple weeks. The biggest thing that we looked at was the amount of layoffs that we had last week, especially with Amazon with those 30,000 layoffs. So, we're going to talk about that and some implications on the labor market.</p>
</details>

但总的来说，我认为目前盘前市场上涨的原因是，特朗普和中国之间的关系似乎出现了一些稳定迹象。他们在周四会面，这在周五提振了市场。10月份我们连续第六个月收涨，当月上涨了2.4%。通常情况下，11月份市场也相对乐观。10月份有些波动，比特币和以太坊在10月的表现不佳，也许11月情况会有所改变，如果真是这样，那将是利好消息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But overall, I think the reason we're green right now overnight is because it looks like there's some some stability between Trump and China. again they met back on Thursday and that helped the markets on Friday. We did close green for the sixth month in a row in October. So we closed out October up 2.4% for the month. Um and then overall, you know, November is relatively green usually and so we had a bit of a choppy October. Bitcoin and Ethereum kind of sucked in October. Maybe that changes for November and if that does that would be bullish.</p>
</details>

现在以太坊有了一些提振，一度冲向4000美元，现在回落到3883美元。比特币也一度突破11万美元，而上周某个时候还只有10.4万美元。所以，如果说有哪个月份适合比特币和以太坊表现出色，那很可能就是11月，因为比特币在11月的表现通常比10月要好一些。但我们将拭目以待，看看月底情况如何。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now Ethereum is getting a little bit of a boost. It was pushing 4,000. Now it's back to 38.83. Bitcoin as well pushing above 110. It was at 104 at one point last week. So, I mean, I think if there was any month for Bitcoin and Ethereum to do well, it would be November, as Bitcoin actually tends to do a little bit better in November than October. But, we're going to see how these turn out as we get into the end of the month.</p>
</details>

### OpenAI 的万亿赌注：Sam Altman 的争议性回应

好的，大约12分钟后，盘前市场就要开盘了，之后我们会进入所有我准备好的话题。在此之前，让我们先看看这个视频，因为它已经彻底火了。Sam Altman 和 Satya Nadella 一起上了 Brad Gerstner 的播客，Brad Gerstner 问了一个相对简单的问题，他说：“我一直听说你们有130亿美元的收入，但你们却承诺要花费1.4万亿美元。我想我们每个人每天都在质疑，如果 OpenAI 无法兑现这些支出承诺，这会不会是一个会爆炸的泡沫？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so in about 12 minutes, we are going to have the overnight markets open and then we'll get into all the topics I've lined up after the overnight markets open. Before that, let's just take a look at this video because it has absolutely gone viral. Sam Alman was on the Brad Gersonner podcast with Satia Nadella and Brad Gersonner asked a relatively simple question which is hey I keep hearing you have 13 billion in revenue but you've committed to spend 1.4 trillion I think every day all of us question could this be a bubble that explodes if open AAI isn't able to officially spend on these commitments that they've committed to spend on and here is what Mr. Sam Alman had to say to that question.</p>
</details>

> **Brad Gerstner:** 一家年收入130亿美元的公司，如何能做出1.4万亿美元的支出承诺？你也听到了那些批评。
>
> **Sam Altman:** 首先，我们的收入远不止那个数。其次，Brad，如果你想卖掉你的股份，我可以帮你找个买家。
>
> **Brad Gerstner:** 我只是觉得，有很多人……
>
> **Sam Altman:** 包括我自己。那些对我们的计算资源等问题忧心忡忡的人，会很乐意购买股份。所以我想我们可以很快就把你的或者其他任何人的股份卖给那些在Twitter上对此事大声嚷嚷的人。我们确实计划收入会急剧增长，而且它正在急剧增长。我们正在做一个前瞻性的赌注，认为它会继续增长，不仅ChatGPT会持续增长，我们还能成为重要的AI云服务商之一，我们的消费设备业务将成为一项重要业务，能够自动化科学研究的AI将创造巨大价值。所以，我很少有想成为上市公司的时刻，但当那些人写着“OpenAI即将破产”之类的荒谬文章时，上市就显得很有吸引力了。我很想告诉他们可以直接做空股票，然后看他们被烧得体无完肤。我们经过了仔细的规划，我们了解技术和能力将如何发展，以及我们能围绕这些构建什么样的产品并产生收入。我们可能会搞砸，这是我们正在下的赌注，并为此承担着一定的风险。一个确定的风险是，如果我们没有计算能力，我们就无法产生收入，也无法制造出这种规模的模型。
>
> **Satya Nadella:** Brad，作为合作伙伴和投资者，我只想说一件事。我所见过的OpenAI的商业计划，没有一个他们没有超额完成的。所以在某种程度上，在增长和业务方面，他们的执行力令人难以置信。坦白说，大家都谈论OpenAI在用户和使用上的成功，但我想说，他们的整体业务执行力简直是不可思议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> How, you know, how can a company with 13 billion in revenues make 1.4 trillion of spend commitments? You know, and and and you've heard the criticism.
>> First of all, we're doing well more revenue than that. Second of all, Brad, if you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer.
>> I just enough like, you know, people are I I think there's a lot of people who would love to buy OpenAI shares. I don't I don't think you want,
>> including myself. including myself
>> who talk with a lot of like breathless concern about our comput stuff or whatever that would be thrilled to buy shares. So I think we we could sell you know your shares or anybody else's to some of the people who are making the most noise on Twitter whatever about this very quickly. We do plan for revenue to grow steeply. Revenue is growing steeply. We are taking a forward bet that it's going to continue to grow grow and that not only will chache keep growing but we will be able to become one of the important AI clouds that our consumer device business will be a significant and important thing that AI that can automate science will create huge value. So, you know, there are not many times that I want to be a public company, but one of the rare times it's appealing is when those people are writing these ridiculous open AI is about to go out of business and you know, whatever. I would love to tell them they could just short the stock and I would love to see them get burned on that. Um, but you know, I we carefully plan, we understand where the technology, where the capability is going to grow, go and and how the products we can build around that and the revenue we can generate. we might screw it up like this is the bet that we're making and we're taking a risk along with that. A certain risk is if we don't have the compute, we will not be able to generate the revenue or make the models at these at this kind of scale.
>> Exactly. And
>> let me just say one thing uh Brad as both a partner and um an investor there is not been a single business plan that I've seen from OpenAI that they have put in and not beaten it. So in some sense this is the one place where you know in terms of their growth and just even the business it's been unbelievable execution quite frankly I mean obviously openai everyone talks about all the success in the usage and what have you but even um I would say all up uh the business execution has been just pretty unbelievable.</p>
</details>

这个片段之所以在周末疯传，原因有几点。当我看到时，我也很惊讶。首先，这是一个合理的问题。博通、甲骨文、AMD、英伟达，根据《华尔街日报》上周的一篇文章，仅凭与英伟达达成的交易公告，它们的市值就增加了6300亿美元。AMD的股价之所以能达到250美元，唯一的原因就是与OpenAI的这笔交易。这凸显了这笔交易和OpenAI承诺的支出对这些公司的重要性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, so the reason that went so viral over the weekend, we got about nine minutes till the overnight markets open and uh then we'll get into all the other topics. But the reason that went viral and when I saw it, I was quite surprised as well is number one, it's a legit question. Okay, Broadcom, Oracle, AMD, Nvidia, there was an article last week from the Wall Street Journal have gained 630 billion in market cap just from the announcements of the deals that they have uh committed to Nvidia. I mean AMD probably will be stuck at $158 a share for everyone. I know there's a big retail army in AMD. The o the literal only reason that stock is at 250 is because of this opening eye deal. That's it. And if someone else has a different reason, let me know. But that was the reason that got the stock to break out. So it is so and the reason is not to downplay the significance of that deal. It's rather to un to underwrite how important the deal is and the spending commitments that are necessary to get AMD to that $400 billion market cap or to get Oracle to that $800 billion market cap which is pledged from OpenAI.</p>
</details>

所以，当 Brad Gerstner，作为 OpenAI 早期最重要的投资者之一，问了这样一个简单的问题时，他其实是在给 Sam Altman 一个轻松得分的机会，而不是想刁难他。他本可以简单地回答：“很多人以为我们年收入130亿，实际上远不止于此。”（估计接近250亿）。“我们预计到2027年收入可能达到千亿级别。” 这样一来，1.4万亿美元的支出承诺（大约是预期收入的14倍）就不会显得那么疯狂了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when Brad Gersonner who by the way is one of the bigger investors from the previous two years he was early in 2023 in the private rounds of OpenAI so he knows the company very well. When your biggest supporter is asking you a very simple question he's basically giving you a layup. He's not trying to give you a gotcha question. this guy has a ton of your stock. Why would he be trying to make you look bad? He's trying to give you the opportunity to simply say this is if obviously I'm all I would be like look a lot of people think we're doing 13 billion in revenue. We are doing significantly more than that which he wouldn't be lying about. I think the estimate is closer to 25 billion in revenue. Number two, our estimates are that by 2027 we're probably going to be hitting triple digits. So about 100 billion in revenue, which Sam Alman mentions a little bit later in the podcast, but he does it in kind of like a an egotistic way, right? He makes like he he kind of says it he says it in a way that's bragging when in reality he could have just answered the question be like look we're projecting we don't know if it's going to happen but we think by 2027 we could get to 100 billion revenue which makes the 1.4 4 trillion spend, which is only about 14 times the amount of revenue they're they're bringing in. Not look as crazy as the $1 13 billion annual run rate.</p>
</details>

然后他本可以感谢像 Brad、Satya、Jensen 和 Lisa Su 这样的支持者。他可以说：“因为有这些聪明人的支持，我们对兑现支出承诺充满信心。” 这就足够了。这是一个绝佳的机会，让他向所有信任他公司的人表示感谢。但他没有，反而表现得像个自恋狂，说什么“我真希望我们是上市公司，这样我就可以让人们做空我们的股票了”。他试图模仿 Alex Karp 的风格，但很少有人能模仿 Karp 的魅力而不显得像个混蛋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then he could have said, you know, let people say whatever they want to say. We have amazing people like you, Brad, that support us. We have amazing people like Satia and Jensen and Lisa Sue that support us. And because we have all these really smart people supporting our company and our growth, we are very confident that we're going to be able to commit to the spending that we have said that we're going to commit to publicly. That's it. That's all you have to say. That's literally all he It was such a layup for him to give a compliment to all the people that are trusting that his company's going to succeed. He could give them a compliment back and say because they believe in us so much, you know, we're so excited to continue working on this journey. And that would have been the end of it. Instead, he turns into this like narcissistic, oh, I wish we were a public company so I could tell people to short the stock. He tried to pull a Karp moment and it's like there's a reason Karp is Karp. Very few people can emulate what Karp does and still be relatively charismatic. Most people that try to do that are not going to be charismatic. They're going to just seem like dicks.</p>
</details>

我认为这是一个奇怪且过度防御性的回应。你能看出来 Gerstner 也被吓了一跳。虽然 Gerstner 后来在推特上为他辩护，说大家反应过度了，但这并不重要。重要的是，如果 Sam 对他最大的支持者之一都这样，我很好奇他对别人会是怎样的态度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And uh you know that's that's what he ended up doing. So I thought it was a a weird response. I think it was overly defensive. You could tell Gersonner was taken back for it and Gersner you know publicly commented on Twitter. He was like I think Sam is getting too much flack for that. I mean look in the grand scheme of things is this going to matter? No. But like at the end of the day, if Sam is acting like that to one of his biggest supporters, aka Brad Gersonner, I wonder how he acts to other people, you know? I really do. And and it's one of those things where it really makes you think in terms of how this is playing out.</p>
</details>

但讽刺的是，即使你讨厌 Sam Altman，如果你投资了这个市场，你也不得不希望 OpenAI 成功。它已经“大到不能倒”了。AMD、Oracle、甚至英伟达的市值增长都与 OpenAI 息息相关。除非像 Gemini 或 XAI 这样的公司能大规模超越 ChatGPT 每周8亿的活跃用户，否则 OpenAI 似乎必须赢。所以，如果你投资了 AI 生态系统，你就得为他们的成功加油，尽管其掌舵人并不总是最有魅力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But in in an age where every single AI company is depending on this company, OpenAI, which is the catch 22. It's like even if you hate Sam Alman, even if that clip pissed you off so much, even if you think this guy is squirmy and you just want nothing to do with him, if you are invested in this market, you have to believe OpenAI is going to win. It is just that simple. And I would love any analysis from someone telling me that OpenAI can lose and the AI bull market can continue because I've looked at the numbers. I'm working on a Substack piece about this coming out next week and it it there is no way OpenAI essentially they're too big to fail. It's just that simple. They're too big to fail given this. And you can say, "Oh, well, what about XAI Gemini?" Sure. But the reason AMD is at a $400 billion market cap is because of OpenAI. The reason Oracle is pushing 700 800 billion is because of OpenAI. The reason Nvidia to an extent has added the level of market cap that's added is because of OpenAI. So, at the end of the day, it's like unless a company like Gemini or or uh XAI massively overtake the 800 million weekly activives that CHABT has, feels like opening eye is too big. And as a result, they kind of have to win. So you kind of have to root for their success if you're invested in the AI ecosystem. But the guy who's running it is obviously not the most charismatic in terms of how we answer that question.</p>
</details>

不过，Sam Altman 后来在采访中确实提到，他们有望在2027年前实现1000亿美元的年收入。这是一个重磅消息，改变了很多人的预期。如果他们真的能实现甚至超越这个目标，那么 OpenAI 目前5000亿美元的估值可能还被低估了，因为它只相当于5倍的市销率，这很便宜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The one thing he did say though later in the interview and we'll listen to some other parts of it in a bit is uh that we are on track to get 100 billion of revenue by 2027 which is a big deal. Uh I think that changed a lot of estimates. If they're underounting that 100 billion and it's actually going to be like 200 billion something like that. It really makes OpenAI at 500 billion probably look undervalued. At that point it's trading at 5x sales which is cheap. And you know, if that's the case, then you're likely going to get some more momentum out of OpenAI over the coming years.</p>
</details>

### 英伟达的中国困境与美国制造

现在，让我们看看盘前市场的情况。标普500指数期货上涨了0.37%。英伟达上涨了近1%，我对此感到高兴，因为特朗普在CBS的采访中说，他和Jensen谈过，并同意像Blackwell这样的芯片不应该卖给我们的最大竞争对手。我不知道这对Blackwell芯片意味着什么，也不认为我们短期内能从中国获得收入。但特朗普确实暗示了Blackwell可能短期内不会进入中国。尽管如此，英伟达的股价还是上涨了，而不是下跌，我认为这是个好现象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nvidia, that's up n7%. Now, I I'm I'm happy that Nvidia is up almost 1% because Trump did say in that CBS interview that um I talked to Jensen and essentially he said that we agreed that Blackwell should not be going well, he agreed. I don't know if Jensen agreed that Blackwell should not be going to our biggest competitors. I don't know what that necessarily means for Blackwell chips and I definitely don't think we're getting China revenue anytime soon. Jensen did have another interview that will look at it. well in a little bit. But, uh, Trump did kind of signal that, you know, maybe Blackwell is not going to be going to China anytime soon. So, the fact that Nvidia is actually up and not going down on that, I think is nice to see.</p>
</details>

现在，让我们来听听 Jensen Huang 的采访，这为我们接下来要讨论的很多事情奠定了基础。这是 Jensen 今天早上在福克斯新闻上的访谈，他谈论了关于中国、特朗普以及当前局势的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, cool. So, let's get into it. I think we'll start off with uh this Jensen interview because this probably frames a lot of stuff that we got to talk about. So this was Jensen. He was on Fox this morning and this is everything that he had to say about China, Trump, what's going on.</p>
</details>

> **主持人:** Jensen，在亚利桑那州生产这款Blackwell芯片有多困难？将如此重要的芯片生产带回美国，实现了怎样的成就？
>
> **Jensen Huang:** 首先，AI是一场工业革命，这是我们这个时代最重要的技术，甚至可能是所有时代中最重要的技术。当特朗普总统刚上任时，他希望我们在本土生产这些关键技术。他想让美国再工业化，他希望能源增长，他希望确保美国在人工智能领域处于领先地位。为了做到这一点，我们需要在能源、芯片、构建AI基础设施和工厂方面领先，当然也包括构建AI模型，以及在医疗、制造、机器人、科学和工业等各个行业应用AI。他希望在他的任期内以光速实现这一切。所以我告诉他，我们将在9个月内与台积电（TSMC）合作，将制造业带回美国。台积电是美国了不起的合作伙伴，还有富士康（Foxconn）、纬创（Wistron）、安靠（Amkor）和日月光（Spill），我们现在已经能够在美国完全生产世界上最先进的AI芯片。亚利桑那州的工人们非常努力，机械工程师、电工、水管工、建筑工人，他们夜以继日地工作。九个月后，我们现在已经量产了世界上最先进的AI芯片。
>
> **主持人:** 在美国生产比在台湾贵很多吗？
>
> **Jensen Huang:** 是的，在美国生产成本更高，但我们会随着时间的推移做得更好。将制造业迁回本土，建立首个此类工厂，成本会高一些，但这没关系。国家安全的好处、供应链弹性的好处、在美国创造就业的好处……我们将生产芯片、系统，而这些AI超级计算机将进入所谓的AI工厂，被美国的每一个行业使用。所以，随着时间的推移，我猜这将创造数百万个就业机会，而且是非常高质量的工作岗位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Tell me about manufacturing this Blackwell chip in Arizona Jensen. How difficult was that to achieve to bring such an important chip production here to America?
>> Well, first of all, AI is a industrial revolution and this is the most important technology of our time, potentially the most important technology of all time. And when President Trump first took office, uh he wanted us to manufacture these critical technologies on shore. He wanted to re-industrialize the United States. He wants to have energy growth. He wants to make sure that United States is a leader in artificial intelligence. And in order to do in order to do so, we need to lead in energy. We need to lead in chips. We need to lead in building AI infrastructures and factories including lead in building AI models of course, but also using AI in all the different applications in various industries from healthcare to manufacturing to robotics to you know science and and industry. So uh he wanted he wanted that uh in his administration and he wanted it at the speed of light and so I told him that we would bring manufacturing back within 9 months with the partnership of TSMC which is an incredible partner for the United States Foxcon Wistron Amcor and Spill we've been able to manufacture now the most advanced AI chip in the world completely in the United States and Arizona the the the the the workers worked incredibly hard the mechanical engineers, the mechanical, the electricians, the plumbers, the construction workers, they all worked around the clock. Nine months later, we're now in volume production of the most advanced AI chip in the world. I
>> Is it much more expensive to do it in the United States versus Taiwan?
>> It is. It is more more expensive to do in the United States, but we're going to get better over time. you know, reman reonshoring manufacturing and the first uh plant of its kind. It's going to cost a little bit more money, but that's okay. the the uh the national security benefits uh the supply chain resilience benefits the job creation benefits here in the United States you know we're going to manufactured chips systems and those systems are going these these AI supercomputers are going to go into what are going to be AI factories which are going to be used by every single industry in the United States and so this is going to create over time you know my guess is millions of jobs, millions of jobs and really really high quality jobs, you know, from high really skilled trade craft.

当被问及这对英伟达的中国业务意味着什么时，Jensen 这样回答：

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's what he had to say specifically when he was asked about what this means for the China part of Nvidia's business.</p>
</details>

> **Jensen Huang:** 这是一次里程碑式的会晤，一项里程碑式的、历史性的协议。我读到的所有新闻都显示，两位总统之间，以及两国之间建立了相互尊重和友好的关系。这为英伟达创造了条件，我希望我们能重返中国市场竞争。在特朗普总统的第一届任期内，他为美国引领科技设定了完美的基调，确保美国公司拥有最好和最先的技术，并让美国科技公司走向世界去竞争和获胜。但在过去四年里，本届政府的政策适得其反。当特朗普总统离任时，我们在中国这个全球最重要的市场之一拥有95%的市场份额，而现在英伟达在中国的市场份额是0%。所以，现在是时候重置，回到特朗普45届政府的政策，让美国AI公司能够去中国，在市场上竞争，并能够在全球推广美国的技术标准，以便我们能设定全球标准，让世界建立在美国标准之上，从而引领世界。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, what an achievement. This is a milestone meeting, a milestone deal, a historic deal. And the readouts uh from from all the news that I've read uh just the respectful uh the friendly relationship that they've built uh between the two presidents and of course between the two countries. Therefore, uh the the post from Secretary Heg Heath and uh and all the readouts from uh Secretary Bessant have have all been extraordinary. You know, this really creates the conditions I hope uh for Nvidia to be able to go back and compete in market in China. Trump 45 in the in President Trump's first administration. Uh he set the tone perfectly for America to lead in technology and make sure that America American companies have the best and first but for American technology companies to go around the world to compete and win. In the last four years, the administration really set us on a path that really backfired. the policies have really backfired from a 95% market share in in the China market which is one of the most important markets in the world when President Trump left office and video's market share in China is now 0%. And so this is really time and it's a great great opportunity for us to reset back to the Trump 45 policies for the Trump 45 policies where AI American AI companies are able to go around go to China compete for compete in the marketplace and be able to diffuse and and proliferate American technology standards around the world so that we could set global standards so that uh the world is built on American standards so that we could lead the world. And so I I think uh creates the conditions for us to do that. I hope we're able to to um revert back to the policies of the Trump 45 administration and and um get back get back into the market and compete.</p>
</details>

很多人将 Jensen 的评论解读为中国业务即将回归。但他并没有这么说，他说的是希望特朗普和习主席的协议能为英伟达重返中国市场创造条件。然而，就在20分钟前，特朗普在采访中明确表示：“我们不把那种芯片（Blackwell）给别人。” 这意味着，如果特朗普对英伟达的立场不变，Blackwell 芯片很可能不会回到中国市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So that was the comment by Jensen. A lot of people interpreted that as China's coming back. Obviously he did not say China's coming back. He's saying hopefully the uh implications of the Trump and Xi deal will lead to China revenue or will will lead to China market share hopefully coming back for Nvidia because right now their market share is zero. And then 20 minutes ago you had this from Trump which is why I was surprised Nvidia is actually up in the overnight markets. But this is exactly what he said about Blackwell.
>> We don't give that ship to other people.
>> That last sentence, we don't give that chip to other people. So, look, maybe Trump is just saying that because he wants to get a little bit more of a negotiation on what we get with China. Uh, but as you can see, he clearly said, "We don't give that chip to other people." which means the blackwell chip is likely not coming back in terms of revenue if this is the similar stance that Trump is going to have on Nvidia.</p>
</details>

即使特朗普对英伟达赞不绝口，如果他不愿意将 Blackwell 芯片给中国，问题就依然存在。中国想要这款芯片，并且夏天时已经表示，他们不想要任何低于 Blackwell 的产品。否则，他们还不如自己造芯片，这就产生了 Jensen 一直在谈论的整个问题——美国技术无法成为全球AI技术的基础。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So even with the praise of Nvidia, even with Jensen bringing GTC to DC, even with Jensen obviously praising the Trump administration and saying that he believes in this whole American re-industrialization, if Trump is not ready to give the Blackwell chip to China, I would imagine China wants the chip and China has already said back in the summer they don't want anything less than Blackwell because if you give them something less than Blackwell, then they might as well just build their own chip, which creates the entire problem that Jensen's been talking about for American technology not being the foundation for overall AI technology around the world. it comes down to Blackwell and you know when we create Vera Rubin when that officially goes live with Nvidia and then we give them Blackwell I'm sure the Chinese are not going to be happy about that. So I mean we don't fully have any details on what's going on with Nvidia but at least the market so far because of the $500 billion opportunity that Jensen talked about last week and uh excluding any of the guidance from China over the next five quarters. I think the market's overlooking that which is like a good thing to see rather than a bad thing to see.</p>

### 中美协议细节与地缘政治稳定性

那么，贸易关系究竟发生了什么？这是昨晚在 US.gov 网站上发布的内容。中方将暂停新的稀土出口管制，为稀土出口发放通用许可证，采取重大措施阻止芬太尼流入美国，暂停自3月4日以来的所有报复性关税和非关税措施，并购买至少1200万公吨的美国大豆。而美国将把关税降低10%（从57%降至47%），并将301条款关税豁免的有效期延长至2026年11月。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now what actually happened with the trade relations? So this came out last night. This was published on the US.gov website and this is exactly what they said. The Chinese are going to suspend new rare earth export controls. They're going to issue general licenses for exports of rare earths. They're going to take significant measures to end the flow of fentinel to the US. They're going to suspend all retaliatory tariffs since March 4th. suspend all retaliatory non-tariff measures since March 4th and purchase at least 12 million metric tonses of US soybeans. The US is going to lower tariffs by 10% from uh 57 to 47, extend the expiration of section 301 tariff exclusions until November 2026 published by the White House yesterday.</p>
</details>

协议中没有任何内容表明中国将正式获得 Blackwell 芯片，但我认为这让市场松了一口气，因为年底可能爆发的大规模贸易战似乎不会发生了。当然，中方还需要确认这一点，但他们似乎已经购买了一些大豆以示诚意。这似乎表明情况相对稳定，对稀土的出口管制可能不会发生，这对全球市场是件好事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So nothing in that says that China will officially get Blackwell, but I think it's giving the market a lot of ease now that there's not this massive trade war that might break out towards the end of the year. Obviously, the Chinese have to confirm this, but I think they already bought some soybeans as a sign of good faith. And, you know, given the negotiations that happened last week that we covered, it seems like everything is relatively okay and the export controls on rare earths that kind of really got everyone scared globally might not be happening and as a result, you know, that might be the good thing.</p>

### 分化的经济：财富效应与消费疲软

现在，让我们谈谈经济的总体状况。上周有很多股票，特别是面向消费者的股票，遭受了重创，这表明实体经济可能存在一些问题，即便华尔街尚未感受到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Having said that, let's talk about Basent. So, here is Bent talking about the general state of the economy right now. And the reason this is important is because a lot of stocks last week took a hit. And we're going to talk about those stocks in a second. But a lot of those stocks are more consumer oriented stocks showing maybe there's some issues on Main Street, even if not on Wall Street yet.</p>
</details>

看看这些重要消费类股票的年初至今回报率：Chipotle 的 CEO 亲口说，年收入低于10万美元、年龄在25至34岁之间的人进店消费减少了。Wendy's 今年下跌了44%。Lululemon 简直是一场灾难，下跌了54%。Whirlpool 下跌35%，Macy's 下跌27%，Caesars 下跌38%。当你看到这些消费类股票时，情况有点难看。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, so take a look at this right here. These are the year-to-ate returns on some very important consumer stocks. Chipotle, we all saw last week what happened with their earnings. The CEO literally said people making less than 100,000 from ages 25 to 34 are not entering the store as much. Wendy's was down 44% this year. I didn't even know that was the case. Lululemon, that's been a train wreck, down 54%. Whirlpool down 35%, although they did have good earnings. Macy's down 27%. Caesars down 38%. Under Arour down 36. I mean, it's a little ugly when you look at these consumer stocks.</p>
</details>

另一张图表显示了更多情况：金宝汤公司、通用磨坊、卡夫亨氏、高露洁、宝洁，这些都是今年表现最差的股票。这引出了两个观点。第一，这些公司本身可能不是世界上最好的公司。第二，人们开始怀疑消费者到底怎么了，因为这些都是面向消费者的公司，而且它们销售的都是相对便宜的产品，但股价却表现不佳。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's another chart that shows even more. the Camples company, General Mills, Craft Hind, Colgate, uh, Proctor and Gamble. These have been the worst performing stocks of the entire year. So, there's two kind of nuanced points around this. Number one is has has have these companies been the best companies in the world. Probably not. I would imagine Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, etc. are executing a lot better than Proctor and Gamble and and Lululemon. So, that that's the first point. But second of all, the reason I think people are starting to wonder what's going on with the consumer is because these are consumer oriented companies and it's not just Chipotle. There's a lot of other fast food brands. And, you know, these are companies that are selling relatively cheap products that have not been able to get their stock to do well.</p>
</details>

这引出了一个关于**财富效应**（Wealth Effect：指资产价格上涨让人们感觉更富有，从而增加消费的经济现象）的讨论。以下是《The Compound and Friends》播客中关于这个话题的一段剪辑，它解释了为什么经济看起来还能撑住。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Having said that, this leads into the conversation around the wealth effect. Here is a two to three minute clip from the compound and friends this weekend talking about this idea of the wealth effect because again that is why it looks like the economy is holding up.</p>
</details>

> **播客主持人:** 我是财富效应的忠实信徒。我认为这是经济中最重要的因素，没有之一。它决定了就业，决定了人们是否能加薪，甚至决定了资本支出项目。没有什么比股价下跌30%更能迅速阻止AI领域的资本支出了。因此，我认为我们低估了股市影响实体经济的能力。福特和通用汽车本周创下了52周新高。为什么？因为财富效应让人们走进经销商，购买新的F-150。需求从未减弱，因为人们持有资产，即使只是他们的401k，他们也感觉更富有了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I want to double click on that because like this is the hill that I like to die on every week. I'm a wealth effect truther. I think it's the number one most important factor in the economy, bar none. It decides employment. It decides whether or not people get wage increases. I think it decides capex spending projects. Nothing will halt AI capex in its tracks faster than a stock price that falls 30%. Nothing. And so, as a result, I really think we underpric the ability of the stock market to influence things that happen in the real economy. The story there is the wealth effect is what sends people to the dealership to buy a new F-150. Not trade war [ __ ] These companies have handled this tariff war handled this this tariff situation so well, not because they're in control of the prices of of the supplies they buy, but because the demand never let up.
>> I I and I I think this is a really important point. Ford and GM have out or GM has at least outperformed Tesla this year. Ford's basically trading at a two-year high. Why? They're able to sell more cars. Why are they able to sell more cars? Because people have more money, not just because of their paychecks, but because they're holding on to assets. Even if it's just their 401k, they feel richer. That's the whole concept of the wealth effect. And they're able to buy more cars and those cars are relatively cheaper than a Tesla. So, I mean, from that perspective, you ask yourself, how is GM going up 20% in a day like it did two weeks ago? It might be because of this wealth effect. The demand never let up because everyone's stock portfolio is at a record high.</p>
</details>

另一个非常重要的数据是：现在35岁左右的人，股票占其净资产的比例是23%。而在婴儿潮一代35岁时，这个比例只有7%。这是一个巨大的差异。当股市由科技股引领时，35岁及以下的年轻人大多投资于他们理解的公司，如英伟达、特斯拉、亚马逊。这些公司股价上涨，让他们感觉更富有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what's really important is another stat from the show that was that was just very intriguing to me. People in their early 30s or I think it's mid-30s, 35 years old, they their percentage of uh equities as a percentage of their net worth in this generation. So I guess millennials you can call it 23%. So if you are around 35 in that you know early 30s range, mid-30s range, 23% of your net worth on an aggregate is in equities. For the boomers when they were 35 years old, it was 7%. That is a massive difference, right? And so when you have a stock market with technology stocks that are leading the way, most people 35 and younger, right? Nvidia, Tesla, Amazon, the companies that they actually understand, the companies that they can see the technology in front of their face, those are the companies they're investing in, those are the companies that have gone up, those are the companies that have done well. So when 7% decades ago as a result of your net worth was in equities versus 23% it makes a vast difference on the level of wealth or at least the perception of wealth that people think that they have.</p>
</details>

这就是为什么我们看到消费品牌股价下跌，但股市整体上涨，人们仍然愿意花钱。因为大型科技公司执行力极强，而且很多人都持有这些公司的股票。美国四大科技公司——亚马逊、谷歌、苹果和微软——在过去12个月的总收入达到了创纪录的1.8万亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that is why when you look at a chart like this is all these consumer brands are down but the stock market's up and people are willing to spend even more. It's because these companies are executing at such a high level and they have so much allocation to these companies. Take a look at this. The combined revenues of the big four US tech companies, Amazon, Google, Apple, and Microsoft, hit a record 1.8 trillion over the last 12 months. Amazon at 691 billion, Apple 416, Google 386, Microsoft 294.</p>

### AI 时代下的就业市场变局

现在让我们看看劳动力市场。这张图表显示，自2022年11月ChatGPT推出以来，标普500指数一路上扬，而总职位空缺数量却在下降。这让人们开始思考：AI这东西是不是会让股东越来越富，而其他人因为没有工作而越来越穷？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, there's another chart that's been going quite viral over the weekend that I think is uh pretty important to look at. And, you know, it goes back to this argument about what's going on with the with the labor market. So, take a look at this. Uh S&P 500 in in the black and then chatbt or sorry, total job openings in the blue. Uh CHBT is in the middle right there. November 2022 when it officially launched. As you can see, the S&P 500 is going higher, and for all of us that own assets, we are getting richer. The job market is getting worse, even though employment is still below 5%, which is historically not bad. Uh, but as you can see, total job openings are going down. And as a result, it's one of those things where people are starting to wonder, wait a second, is this damn AI thing going to make shareholders rich, but going to leave everybody else poor because no one's going to have a job, which eventually will hurt shareholders at some point.</p>
</details>

看看亚马逊和微软的员工数量，它们都从2021年的峰值下降了。大型科技公司雇佣的员工总数似乎已经见顶。我认为，它们未来雇佣的员工数量不太可能超过2021年的水平。原因有二：一是疫情期间过度招聘，二是它们根本不需要那么多人了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amazon.com employees, this is from the Wall Street Journal. As you can take a look right there, along with Microsoft is down. Amazon is down from 2021 after the recent round of layoffs, which likely some more layoffs are coming. And then Microsoft is down 6% from the peak. It seems like the total amount of jobs that the big tech companies have used to employ has reached the peak and I think it is very unlikely like I'm just you know just looking at these charts and then anecdotally looking at what's going on in the world of AI it seems very unlikely that the big tech companies are ever going to have more employees than they had back in 2021. Uh for two reasons. Number one they overhired during the pandemic. So that was one thing that contributed to that many new employees. Number two is like they just don't need that many people.</p>
</details>

另一张图表也印证了这一点。今天，加州的科技工作岗位数量占全美科技工作岗位的比例，甚至比2008年金融危机时还要少。这背后可能有比AI更宏观的原因，比如公司迁往德州或外包到其他国家，但很难否认AI可能在其中扮演了角色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's another chart that exemplifies this. So, this is the ongoing share of uh US tech jobs that are located in California, which is the tech capital of the world. There are fewer tech jobs in California today in 2025 than during the 2008 great financial crisis. Now in 2008 uh the tech companies were just starting right u well not just starting I mean like a lot of them had just IPOed. Google IPOed in 2005. Meta was just you know evolving from a startup. I think it raised the series A back in 2007. So the tech companies were hiring aggressively in 2008. But you would think in 2025 the percentage of US tax jobs in California should be way higher than what it was 17 years ago. And that's not the case. And there's probably more macro arguments to explain that than just AI. But it's hard to undermine the fact that AI could be playing a role right here. And why there's just not that many tech jobs that's needed as a percentage of the overall jobs in California.</p>

### 11月市场展望与宏观趋势

从历史上看，11月份的市场表现通常相当不错。自1927年以来，标普500指数在59%的11月份都是上涨的。在美国总统周期的第一年，也就是我们现在所处的2025年，标普500指数在11月份上涨的概率更是高达67%。目前标普500指数年初至今已上涨18%，历史数据显示，在这种情况下，11月份可能会有2.5%左右的涨幅，这将使我们远超7000点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So November tends to be pretty damn good. Take a look at this. Since 1927, the S&P 500, uh the S&P 500 has ended higher 59% of November. So 59% of the time you tend to get a higher November that is actually a much higher rate than October. During these years, the index averages an average of one or returned an average of 1%. The NASDAQ 100 has seen 2.4%. The Russell 2000 2.64. In year one of a US presidential cycle, which we are in right now, 25, November has also been strong with the S&P 500 going up about 67% of the time. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has been up more than 15% year-to date. Heading into November, it's returned 2.7%. Right now, the S&P 500 is up 18%. So, historically, we could get a two and two two and a half% month going into November, which would put us well over 7,000.</p>

谈到黄金，印度今年已成为最大的黄金进口国之一。过去三个月，印度的黄金进口额飙升至78亿美元，创下历史第二高纪录。印度储备银行也在增持黄金，2025年迄今已增加25吨，总持有量达到880吨，创历史新高。

<p class="english-text">Speaking of gold, India has been one of the largest gold importers this year. India's gold imports surged 7.8 billion over the last three months, the second largest on record. This is triple the amount recorded in the prior 3-month period. And the Reserve Bank of India, we talked a lot about these central banks uh increasing their their allocation to gold. Has increased its gold holdings by 25 tons so far in 2025, reaching 880 tons, an all-time high.</p>

### 本周财报前瞻：Palantir 与 Grab

最后，让我们来谈谈 Palantir。明天他们就要公布财报了。华尔街的盈利预期是10.9亿美元，这基本上就是 Palantir 自己给出的指引。分析师们并没有提高预期，他们基本上是在赌公司会符合指引。但在过去10个季度里，Palantir 每次都超出了预期并提高了指引。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Palinger, let's talk about it. Let's talk about it. First of all, who's excited? Who's excited? We'll talk about Grab after, but Palanteer is tomorrow. I think this is officially the 18th quarter I'll be covering publicly on the channel. It's kind of crazy, dude. Um, but I am pretty excited for it. Now, the reason I am excited for it is because I looked at the numbers over the weekend. Seeking Alpha that I'm pulling up right here has the earnings estimates and the estimates from Wall Street is 1.09. 9 billion. Pounder basically guided for 1.09 billion. So, uh, the analysts aren't really raising the estimate from the company. They're basically betting that the company is going to come in line with guidance. And they've done this for basically the past 10 quarters. And what has Palanteer done? They've uh beat and raised to such a degree that the analysts completely got it wrong.</p>
</details>

问题是，股价已经上涨了很多。过去几周，我一直在170到185美元的区间买入，因为我认为当市场看到50%的增长时会感到兴奋。但这种预期已经反映在股价中了。现在的问题是，财报到底要有多好，才能让股价进一步上涨？如果他们公布的业绩只是符合预期，股价可能会回落到185美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, what's going to happen to the stock? I have no idea because the stock already made a run. I mean, I really for the past couple weeks, the reason I've been buying pounder around that 170 to 185 range is like, hey, I think when the street sees 50% growth, uh, they're going to be excited and the stock probably makes a move higher. That has already happened. So, the anticipation of the move has already taken place. The question now becomes how good is the quarter going to be to get the move to be even better than what we see right here. And if pounder drops to 185 tomorrow, like I can't be that upset about it.</p>
</details>

我认为他们会达到12亿美元的收入，比预期高出1亿美元。如果他们能实现55%到57%的增长，华尔街会再次意识到，这是唯一一家增长如此之快且能有效实施AI的公司。此外，这可能是他们首次单季度新增100个客户。如果他们能做到这些，我认为股价会继续上涨。但我也想降低大家的期望，因为股价已经涨了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think they're going to come in to 1.2 billion. I think they're going to beat by 100 million. And I think if they beat by a hundred million and we get 1.2 billion and we get closer to 25 cents versus 17 cents, again, I I just like if they grow anywhere near 55 to 57% right now, they're got to get 50%. So they would have to have a little bit of a 7 to 8% beep. I mean, dude, like I Wall Street, I think once again, will say, "Wait a second. This is the only company that's growing as fast as they're growing. This is the only company that's actually implementing AI to make it useful." This might be the first quarter where they add 100 customers. They've never added a triple digit number of customers. I think last quarter they added 77. If they add uh 100 and they have more deals of at least a million that was added. I think last quarter they have like 150. If that gets closer to like 175 and they have that topline revenue growth of 55 to 57%. I think the stock can go higher and I think the street will really like it. Now am I expecting that? No. I really want to calm people's expectations down.</p>
</details>

关于 Grab，我明天也很期待。我不知道股价会怎样。我的直觉告诉我，他们会有一个很棒的季度，会超出预期并提高指引，股价会涨到6.8或6.9美元。但理智告诉我，财报在盘后7:30公布，交易非常不活跃，而且这是一家国际公司，可能没有足够的美国投资者关注，所以股价可能会持平或下跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, Grabby Grab. We'll end off the show with Grabby Grab. Um, I'm excited for Grab tomorrow. I don't know what's going to happen to the stock. I really don't. My gut, like like like like my gut is telling me they're going to have a great quarter. They're going to beat and raise. Ebida guidance is going to get closer to 500 million and the stock's going to go much higher than where it is today. I'm thinking around that 680 690 range. Maybe it crosses seven. seven might be psychological, but I think we get above 650, but that's what my gut tells me. What my mind tells me is that the earnings come out at 7:30. None of the brokerages care about Grab. There's not a massive retail community. You have 7:30 to 8:00 p.m. in the overnight markets or in the after hours markets that are highly illquid for any massive move to happen up or down. Uh, and then it's a it's an international stock that's reporting earnings at 8 am Singapore time. So, like there might not be enough people in the United States that even know that the earnings is happening tomorrow. And so, I kind of think that the stock's going to be flat or it's going to be red because there's just not a lot of volume that's going to be coming in</p>
</details>

但我对 Grab 的基本面充满信心。它拥有70亿美元现金，收入增长23%且在加速，调整后EBITDA创历史新高，自由现金流和GAAP盈利能力都在改善。机构持股比例高达84%。如果财报很好但股价不动，我不会抱怨，也不会质疑我的投资逻辑，除非出现了明显的危险信号。

<p class="english-text">With Grab, you have a company with 7 billion in cash growing 23% reacelerating their revenues, adjusted EBA hitting all-time highs, free cash flow, gap profitable, you know, the company's embracing media for the first time in five years. All these things coming together to me, if the stock doesn't move tomorrow and the earnings are just in line with expectations and probably beating and raising like they have for the past couple quarters, I'm not going to complain about it and I I'll take all the shots that people want to take about the stock not moving. That's fine. But I'm not going to sit here and question my thesis unless there is a reason to question it. And so far, Grab hasn't given me a reason. But we're going to see on the earnings and uh if that reason can continue.</p>
