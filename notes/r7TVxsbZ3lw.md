title: 特朗普确认中美协议，市场展望11月：OpenAI争议与Palantir财报前瞻
---

### 11月市场开局展望
大家好，欢迎回到新一期的周日市场期货节目。我们提前三分钟开始了直播，因为我已经准备就绪，不如直接开始。感谢大家的到来，希望各位度过了一个愉快的周末。朋友们，11月正式开始了，这感觉有点疯狂。2025年只剩下两个月了，今天是11月2日。今年过得相当快。10月份的股市跌宕起伏，上周我们讨论了美联储和大型科技公司财报等大量事件。但10月已经结束，我们进入了新的月份。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the Sunday market futures. We are live. We are three minutes early. I was like, you know what? I'm ready to go. we might as well get started. And we are here. Thank everybody for being here. Hope everyone had a great weekend. We've got November officially starting, folks. It's kind of crazy. It really is kind of crazy. We got two months left of 2025. It is November 2nd. Uh this year has gone relatively quick. I mean, October was up and down in regards to the stock market. We had a ton of stuff to cover last week with the Fed and big tech earnings, but October is done and we're here. We are live.</p>
</details>

我们有很多内容要谈。周末期间，有几件事在网上疯传，涉及一些新的访谈，特别是关于 Sam Altman 和 Satya Nadella 的。我们稍后会讨论。特朗普正在接受哥伦比亚广播公司（CBS）的《60分钟》专访，所以在我们节目进行期间，可能会有很多他的言论流出。实际上，我们已经拿到了一些语录和采访片段。因此，在整个小时内，你们可能会看到很多不同的引述，我会把它们显示在屏幕上并进行分析。特朗普五分钟前刚发推文说，如果不实施关税，我们将变成一个第三世界国家。最高法院本周将审理关税案，这将非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We got a lot to talk about. We have a bunch of different things that went viral over the weekend in regards to new interviews, particularly around Sam Alman and Satia Nadella. So, we're going to talk about that. Uh, we got Trump who's doing a CBS 60inut special interview right now. So, there's likely going to be a ton of quotes coming in uh throughout the course of this uh market future show. I mean, we're already getting quotes right now. We have a couple of clips already from the interview. So throughout the entire hour, you're probably going to get a bunch of different quotes and I will put them on the screen and we'll analyze what's going on. Trump already tweeted like five minutes ago that we will be a third world country without the tariffs going into effect. The Supreme Court will be looking at the tariffs case this week. So that's going to be really important.</p>
</details>

我们还会谈到巴菲特的一些最新动态，他的伯克希尔·哈撒韦公司公布了财报。这是沃伦·巴菲特和伯克希尔·哈撒韦公司有史以来最后一个第三季度财报。我们会看看他们的一些操作。此外，我们还有一系列宏观数据和图表，来预测11月份的市场走势。明天，Palantir 将发布财报，所以我们会做一个简短的预告。没错，今天是 Palantir 财报前夜。这应该是我为 Palantir 做的第18个季度财报报道了，有点疯狂。坦白说，这可能是他们最好的一个季度。我们还会聊聊 Grab。所以，这将是内容非常丰富的一周。明天有 Palantir 和 Grab 的财报，绝对会非常疯狂，我们会对即将发生的事情做个预览。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we'll talk about that. Uh and then we got some updates from Buffett. He had earnings with Bergkshire Hathway. This is the last Q3 ever for Warren Buffett and Birkshshire Hathway. So we'll talk about some of the stuff they did. We have a bunch of different macro stats to look at, some charts in regards to what to expect in November. And then tomorrow, you've got Palunteer earnings. So, we're going to do a little bit of a preview on that. It is indeed happy Palunteer Eve. This is what this is the uh 4812 uh 15. This is I think the 18th quarter I've covered for Pounder. Just kind of crazy. And quite frankly, it might be the best quarter. So, we're going to talk about that. And then we got Grabby Grab as well. So, I mean, this is going to be a jam-packed week. Tomorrow is going to be absolutely insane with Palunteer and Grab, and we'll do a preview on what's going on with that. But, we have a lot a lot a lot to talk about.</p>
</details>

### 公司深度分析与市场动态
感谢大家的到来。在我们开始之前，我发布了两份新的深度分析报告，分别是关于 Nebius 和 Grab 的。Grab 这家公司，我大约三个月前写了一份17页的深度报告。周末我完善了这份报告，并正式发布在了 Substack 上。订阅是免费的，没有付费墙。很多人也在问关于 Nebius 的情况。我研究了 Nebius，明天可能会更详细地谈谈，或者节目最后如果大家有问题也可以讨论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, thank you everybody for being here. Before we get started, deep dives are out. Two new deep dives. We have Nebas and Grabby. Grab is a uh company that I I did a 17page deep dive on about three months ago. I I I refined the deep dive over the weekend and I officially published it on Substack. Uh, and so there's the link right there. You guys can check it out. Free to subscribe. Uh, no payw wall, anything like that. And then Nebius, a lot of people were asking for it. And I looked at Nebas and I'll talk about it more tomorrow. Maybe we can talk about at the end of the show if people have some questions.</p>
</details>

简单来说，很难不看好 Nebius，因为它提供了一种全栈集成的数据中心解决方案。我认为那些在股价20美元时就理解了这个论点的多头们，已经获得了丰厚的回报。显然，我当时没有理解这个逻辑，也没有太关注。在 Substack 文章的前半部分，我谈到了我可能错过这个投资机会的原因。但在130美元的价位，我做了计算，数字都在 Substack 里，其实并不可怕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, look, it is really hard to not be bullish on Nebus Nebius from the simple perspective that it is a full stack integrated approach to data centers. And I think the bulls that understood that argument back when it was $20 have been supremely rewarded for it. Uh, I obviously did not understand that thesis, nor did I really pay attention to it. And then the first half of the the Substack or I guess the first kind of like eight paragraphs of the article, I talk about why I likely missed the story. Uh, but at 130, look, I did the numbers. The numbers are in the chat or in in the in the chat in the substack. It's not that scary. It really isn't.</p>
</details>

当然，他们能否再获得一个超大规模云服务商的合同存在很大的执行风险。但在94美元时，它确实是一个很好的买入点，可惜我当时只是卖出了看跌期权。不过说实话，在130美元，风险也并不可怕，最大的风险在于执行力。但我确实认为这家公司有护城河。这是我一直以来对 Nebius 最关心的问题：他们到底有没有护城河，还是只是又一个数据中心公司？我认为他们有。因此，这很令人兴奋。我还没有持仓，文章里也解释了原因，但它已经进入我2026年的观察名单，我们会继续关注进展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, there is a large execution risk on if they can get another hyperscaler deal, but I mean at 94 it was a really good buy and unfortunately I just sold puts on it. But at 130, honestly, it's not that scary. The execution is the biggest risk. But I do think the company has a moat. And I think that's the biggest thing I've been concerned about, Neb, is like, do they have a moat or are they just another data center plate? I think they have a moat. And as a result, uh, it's exciting. So, I don't have a position yet. I talk about why I don't have a position in the article, but it is on my list for 2026, and we're going to see what goes on from there.</p>
</details>

### 中美协议与市场开盘情况
好了，让我们开始吧。感谢大家的到来。再过14分钟，隔夜市场就要开盘了，我们会看看情况如何。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, let's get started. Thank you everybody for being here. In 14 minutes, we are going to get the overnight markets to open and uh we're going to see what happens in overnight.</p>
</details>

目前来看，我认为我们会相对高开，股指期货上涨了0.3%。特朗普已经确认中美之间达成了一项协议，所以我们会谈谈这个协议的具体情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think we're going to open up relatively green. We are up 0.3%. Trump has confirmed there is a USChina deal and so we'll talk about what's going on with the US China deal.</p>
</details>

我不知道中国方面是否已经确认了有正式的协议，这可能也是我们目前期货上涨的原因。但一旦隔夜市场开盘，我们会得到更多细节。我们还有一些关于劳动力市场的新图表需要关注，这一点也非常重要。过去几周我们一直在讨论劳动力市场，其中最引人注目的是上周的大规模裁员，特别是亚马逊裁员3万人。所以我们会讨论这一点及其对劳动力市场的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know if China has confirmed that there is an official China deal and that's why I think we are green, but we're going to get some details on that uh once the overnight markets open and we'll talk about that. We have some new charts on the labor market. That's also really important to look at. We've been talking a lot about the labor market over the past couple weeks. The biggest thing that we looked at was the amount of layoffs that we had last week, especially with Amazon with those 30,000 layoffs. So, we're going to talk about that and some implications on the labor market.</p>
</details>

但总的来说，我认为隔夜市场上涨的原因是，特朗普和中国之间的关系似乎出现了一些稳定迹象。他们在周四会面，这在周五提振了市场。我们在10月份连续第六个月收涨，当月上涨了2.4%。通常情况下，11月份的市场也相对乐观。10月份有些波动，比特币和以太坊在10月的表现不佳，也许11月会有所改变，如果真是这样，那将是利好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But overall, I think the reason we're green right now overnight is because it looks like there's some some stability between Trump and China. again they met back on Thursday and that helped the markets on Friday. We did close green for the sixth month in a row in October. So we closed out October up 2.4% for the month. Um and then overall, you know, November is relatively green usually and so we had a bit of a choppy October. Bitcoin and Ethereum kind of sucked in October. Maybe that changes for November and if that does that would be bullish.</p>
</details>

现在以太坊有了一些提振，一度冲向4000美元，现在回落到3883美元。比特币也一度突破11万美元，而上周某个时候还在10.4万美元。所以，如果说有哪个月份比特币和以太坊会表现出色，那很可能就是11月，因为比特币在11月的表现通常比10月要好一些。但我们还要看月底的情况如何。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now Ethereum is getting a little bit of a boost. It was pushing 4,000. Now it's back to 38.83. Bitcoin as well pushing above 110. It was at 104 at one point last week. So, I mean, I think if there was any month for Bitcoin and Ethereum to do well, it would be November, as Bitcoin actually tends to do a little bit better in November than October. But, we're going to see how these turn out as we get into the end of the month.</p>
</details>

### OpenAI的争议时刻：Sam Altman的傲慢回应
好了，大约12分钟后，隔夜市场就要开盘了，之后我们会讨论所有我准备好的话题。在此之前，我们先来看看这个视频，因为它已经彻底火了。Sam Altman 和 Satya Nadella 一起上了 Brad Gersonner 的播客，Brad Gersonner 问了一个相对简单的问题，他说：“我一直听说你们有130亿美元的收入，但你们却承诺要花费1.4万亿美元。我想我们每个人每天都在质疑，如果 OpenAI 无法兑现这些支出承诺，这会不会是一个会破裂的泡沫？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so in about 12 minutes, we are going to have the overnight markets open and then we'll get into all the topics I've lined up after the overnight markets open. Before that, let's just take a look at this video because it has absolutely gone viral. Sam Alman was on the Brad Gersonner podcast with Satia Nadella and Brad Gersonner asked a relatively simple question which is hey I keep hearing you have 13 billion in revenue but you've committed to spend 1.4 trillion I think every day all of us question could this be a bubble that explodes if open AAI isn't able to officially spend on these commitments that they've committed to spend on.</p>
</details>

以下是 Sam Altman 先生对这个问题的回答。

> Brad Gersonner: 一家年收入130亿美元的公司，如何能做出1.4万亿美元的支出承诺？你也听到了这些批评。
> Sam Altman: 首先，我们的收入远不止这个数。其次，Brad，如果你想卖掉你的股份，我可以帮你找个买家。
> Brad Gersonner: 我只是觉得，有很多人……
> Sam Altman: 包括我自己。
> Brad Gersonner: ……很多人都想买 OpenAI 的股票。那些对我们的计算支出等问题忧心忡忡的人，其实会很乐意购买股份。所以我想我们可以很快就把你或其他任何人的股份卖给那些在 Twitter 上对此事大声嚷嚷的人。我们确实计划收入能急剧增长，而且收入也正在急剧增长。我们正在做一个前瞻性的赌注，认为它会继续增长，不仅 ChatGPT 会持续增长，我们还将成为重要的人工智能云之一，我们的消费设备业务将成为一项重要业务，能够自动化科学的人工智能将创造巨大价值。所以，我很少有想成为上市公司的念头，但有一个罕见的吸引我的时刻，就是当那些人写着些荒谬的文章，说 OpenAI 即将倒闭之类的时候。我很想告诉他们，他们可以直接做空股票，我很想看到他们因此被烧得体无完肤。但是，我们有周密的计划，我们了解技术和能力将如何发展，以及我们能围绕这些构建什么样的产品并产生收入。我们可能会搞砸，这是我们正在下的赌注，我们同时也承担着一定的风险。一个确定的风险是，如果我们没有计算能力，我们就无法产生收入，也无法制造出这种规模的模型。
> Satya Nadella: Brad，让我说一句，作为合作伙伴和投资者，我从未见过 OpenAI 提出过任何一份他们未能超越的商业计划。所以在某种程度上，这是唯一一个在增长和业务方面都表现出令人难以置信的执行力的地方。坦白说，很明显，每个人都在谈论 OpenAI 在使用率等方面的所有成功，但我想说，总的来说，他们的业务执行力简直令人难以置信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and here is what Mr. Sam Alman had to say to that question. >> How, you know, how can a company with 13 billion in revenues make 1.4 trillion of spend commitments? You know, and and and you've heard the criticism. >> First of all, we're doing well more revenue than that. Second of all, Brad, if you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. >> I just enough like, you know, people are I I think there's a lot of people who would love to buy OpenAI shares. I don't I don't think you want, >> including myself. including myself >> who talk with a lot of like breathless concern about our comput stuff or whatever that would be thrilled to buy shares. So I think we we could sell you know your shares or anybody else's to some of the people who are making the most noise on Twitter whatever about this very quickly. We do plan for revenue to grow steeply. Revenue is growing steeply. We are taking a forward bet that it's going to continue to grow grow and that not only will chache keep growing but we will be able to become one of the important AI clouds that our consumer device business will be a significant and important thing that AI that can automate science will create huge value. So, you know, there are not many times that I want to be a public company, but one of the rare times it's appealing is when those people are writing these ridiculous open AI is about to go out of business and you know, whatever. I would love to tell them they could just short the stock and I would love to see them get burned on that. Um, but you know, I we carefully plan, we understand where the technology, where the capability is going to grow, go and and how the products we can build around that and the revenue we can generate. we might screw it up like this is the bet that we're making and we're taking a risk along with that. A certain risk is if we don't have the compute, we will not be able to generate the revenue or make the models at these at this kind of scale. >> Exactly. And >> let me just say one thing uh Brad as both a partner and um an investor there is not been a single business plan that I've seen from OpenAI that they have put in and not beaten it. So in some sense this is the one place where you know in terms of their growth and just even the business it's been unbelievable execution quite frankly I mean obviously openai everyone talks about all the success in the usage and what have you but even um I would say all up uh the business execution has been just pretty unbelievable.</p>
</details>

这个片段之所以在周末疯传，原因如下。当我看到时，我也很惊讶。首先，这是一个合理的问题。博通、甲骨文、AMD、英伟达，根据《华尔街日报》上周的一篇文章，仅凭与英伟达的交易公告，它们的市值就增加了6300亿美元。AMD 的股价可能一直停留在每股158美元，我知道 AMD 有庞大的散户军团。这只股票能涨到250美元，唯一的原因就是和 OpenAI 的这笔交易。就是这样。如果有人有不同意见，请告诉我。但这正是让该股突破的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, so the reason that went so viral over the weekend, we got about nine minutes till the overnight markets open and uh then we'll get into all the other topics. But the reason that went viral and when I saw it, I was quite surprised as well is number one, it's a legit question. Okay, Broadcom, Oracle, AMD, Nvidia, there was an article last week from the Wall Street Journal have gained 630 billion in market cap just from the announcements of the deals that they have uh committed to Nvidia. I mean AMD probably will be stuck at $158 a share for everyone. I know there's a big retail army in AMD. The o the literal only reason that stock is at 250 is because of this opening eye deal. That's it. And if someone else has a different reason, let me know. But that was the reason that got the stock to break out.</p>
</details>

这么说的目的不是要贬低那笔交易的重要性，而是要强调这笔交易以及 OpenAI 承诺的支出对于让 AMD 市值达到4000亿美元，或者让甲骨文市值达到8000亿美元是多么重要。所以，当 Brad Gersonner，顺便说一句，他是过去两年里最大的投资者之一，他在2023年早期就参与了 OpenAI 的私募轮，所以他非常了解这家公司。当你最大的支持者问你一个非常简单的问题，他基本上是给你一个轻松得分的机会，而不是想刁难你。这个人持有你公司大量的股票，他为什么要让你难堪？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it is so and the reason is not to downplay the significance of that deal. It's rather to un to underwrite how important the deal is and the spending commitments that are necessary to get AMD to that $400 billion market cap or to get Oracle to that $800 billion market cap which is pledged from OpenAI. So when Brad Gersonner who by the way is one of the bigger investors from the previous two years he was early in 2023 in the private rounds of OpenAI so he knows the company very well. When your biggest supporter is asking you a very simple question he's basically giving you a a layup. He's not trying to give you a gotcha question. this guy has a ton of your stock. Why would he be trying to make you look bad?</p>
</details>

他想给你一个机会，让你简单地说：“很多人以为我们年收入130亿美元，实际上我们远不止于此。”他这么说并不会撒谎，因为据估计，实际收入接近250亿美元。第二，他可以说：“我们的预测是，到2027年，我们可能会达到三位数，也就是大约1000亿美元的收入。”Sam Altman 在播客后面确实提到了这一点，但他用一种自负的方式说的。他本可以简单地回答这个问题，说：“我们预测，虽然不确定能否实现，但我们认为到2027年，我们能达到1000亿美元的收入。”这使得1.4万亿美元的支出（仅为他们收入的14倍）看起来不像相对于130亿美元年收入那样疯狂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He's trying to give you the opportunity to simply say this is if obviously I'm all I would be like look a lot of people think we're doing 13 billion in revenue. We are doing significantly more than that which he wouldn't be lying about. I think the estimate is closer to 25 billion in revenue. Number two, our estimates are that by 2027 we're probably going to be hitting triple digits. So about 100 billion in revenue, which Sam Alman mentions a little bit later in the podcast, but he does it in kind of like a an egotistic way, right? He makes like he he kind of says it he says it in a way that's bragging when in reality he could have just answered the question be like look we're projecting we don't know if it's going to happen but we think by 2027 we could get to 100 billion revenue which makes the 1.4 4 trillion spend, which is only about 14 times the amount of revenue they're they're bringing in. Not look as crazy as the $1 13 billion annual run rate.</p>
</details>

然后他本可以说：“让别人说去吧。我们有像你 Brad 这样出色的支持者，有像 Satya、Jensen 和 Lisa Su 这样优秀的人支持我们。正因为有这些非常聪明的人支持我们公司和我们的成长，我们非常有信心能够兑现我们公开承诺的支出。” 就这样，他只需要这么说。这对他来说是一个绝佳的机会，去赞美所有信任他公司会成功的人。他可以回敬一句赞美，说因为他们如此相信我们，我们非常兴奋能继续这段旅程。这样事情就结束了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then he could have said, you know, let people say whatever they want to say. We have amazing people like you, Brad, that support us. We have amazing people like Satia and Jensen and Lisa Sue that support us. And because we have all these really smart people supporting our company and our growth, we are very confident that we're going to be able to commit to the spending that we have said that we're going to commit to publicly. That's it. That's all you have to say. That's literally all he It was such a layup for him to give a compliment to all the people that are trusting that his company's going to succeed. He could give them a compliment back and say because they believe in us so much, you know, we're so excited to continue working on this journey. And that would have been the end of it.</p>
</details>

相反，他变成了一个自恋狂，说什么“我希望我们是上市公司，这样我就可以叫人做空股票了”。他试图模仿 Karp 的风格，但问题是，Karp 之所以是 Karp 是有原因的。很少有人能模仿 Karp 的做法而仍然显得有魅力。大多数尝试这样做的人不会有魅力，只会显得像个混蛋。而他最终就是这样。所以我认为这是一个奇怪的回应，反应过度了。你能看出来 Gersonner 都被他搞得措手不及。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Instead, he turns into this like narcissistic, oh, I wish we were a public company so I could tell people to short the stock. He tried to pull a Karp moment and it's like there's a reason Karp is Karp. Very few people can emulate what Karp does and still be relatively charismatic. Most people that try to do that are not going to be charismatic. They're going to just seem like dicks. And uh you know that's that's what he ended up doing. So I thought it was a a weird response. I think it was overly defensive. You could tell Gersonner was taken back for it</p>
</details>

### OpenAI：AI生态中“大到不能倒”的存在
Gersonner 在 Twitter 上公开评论，试图为他辩护，说：“我觉得 Sam 因为这个受到了太多抨击。”他说人们把他的话解读为过于好斗，他们事后还笑了。我说：“当然。”但在一个每家 AI 公司都依赖 OpenAI 的时代，这就是一个悖论。即使你讨厌 Sam Altman，即使那个片段让你非常生气，即使你觉得这家伙油滑，不想和他有任何瓜葛，但如果你投资了这个市场，你就必须相信 OpenAI 会赢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and Gersner you know publicly commented on Twitter. He was like I think Sam is getting too much flack for that. I mean look in the grand scheme of things is this going to matter? No. But like at the end of the day, if Sam is acting like that to one of his biggest supporters, aka Brad Gersonner, I wonder how he acts to other people, you know? I really do. And and it's one of those things where it really makes you think in terms of how this is playing out. So again, Gersonner tried to defend him right here, saying that people are reading it to say I'm being too feisty. We laughed about it. I'm like, sure, but in in an age where every single AI company is depending on this company, OpenAI, which is the catch 22. It's like even if you hate Sam Alman, even if that clip pissed you off so much, even if you think this guy is squirmy and you just want nothing to do with him, if you are invested in this market, you have to believe OpenAI is going to win.</p>
</details>

就这么简单。我很乐意看到任何分析告诉我 OpenAI 可以输，而 AI 牛市还能继续，因为我看过数据。我正在写一篇关于这个问题的 Substack 文章，下周会发布。根本不可能。OpenAI 基本上是“大到不能倒”。就是这么简单。他们太大了，不能倒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is just that simple. And I would love any analysis from someone telling me that OpenAI can lose and the AI bull market can continue because I've looked at the numbers. I'm working on a Substack piece about this coming out next week and it it there is no way OpenAI essentially they're too big to fail. It's just that simple. They're too big to fail given this.</p>
</details>

你可能会说：“哦，那 XAI 和 Gemini 呢？”当然。但 AMD 市值能达到4000亿美元，是因为 OpenAI。甲骨文能冲向7000、8000亿美元，也是因为 OpenAI。英伟达市值能增加到现在的水平，在某种程度上也是因为 OpenAI。所以，归根结底，除非像 Gemini 或 XAI 这样的公司能大规模超越 ChatGPT 每周8亿的活跃用户，否则感觉 OpenAI 太大了。因此，他们必须赢。所以如果你投资了 AI 生态系统，你就得为他们的成功加油。但运营这家公司的人，在回答那个问题的方式上，显然不是最有魅力的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you can say, "Oh, well, what about XAI Gemini?" Sure. But the reason AMD is at a $400 billion market cap is because of OpenAI. The reason Oracle is pushing 700 800 billion is because of OpenAI. The reason Nvidia to an extent has added the level of market cap that's added is because of OpenAI. So, at the end of the day, it's like unless a company like Gemini or or uh XAI massively overtake the 800 million weekly activives that CHABT has, feels like opening eye is too big. And as a result, they kind of have to win. So you kind of have to root for their success if you're invested in the AI ecosystem. But the guy who's running it is obviously not the most charismatic in terms of how we answer that question.</p>
</details>

是的，Altman 说我们想让那些 GPU 增加100倍。有一点你必须佩服 OpenAI 的是，如果你投资了 IEN 或 Nebius 或所有这些数据中心公司，它们都需要有人签订大量的 GPU 支出合同，大量的计算能力。而最终，OpenAI 就是那些承诺了1.4万亿美元的公司之一。我没听说过有多少其他公司承诺在未来10年内投入1.4万亿美元，说实话，这个数字可能还算便宜的。所以，这只是 AI 整体结构演变的方式之一。但很明显，那次采访之所以疯传，是因为 Sam 的言行有点像个混蛋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Alman said we want to 100x those GPUs. And the one thing you have to commend OpenAI for is that look, if you're invested in IEN or Nebus or like all the all these data center plays need someone to contract massive amounts of GPU spend, massive amounts of compute capacity. And at the end of the day, uh, OpenAI is one of those companies that is again committed 1.4 trillion. Like I haven't heard a lot of other companies commit 1.4 trillion in the next 10 years, which honestly might be cheap. So, it's just one of those ways that the the overall structure of AI seems to be playing out. But obviously, that interview went viral because, you know, Sam kind of sounded like a dick.</p>
</details>

不过，他在采访后期确实说了一件事，我们稍后会听听其他部分，那就是我们有望在2027年前实现1000亿美元的收入，这是件大事。我认为这改变了很多人的预期。如果他们对这1000亿美元的预测是保守的，实际上可能会达到2000亿左右，那么 OpenAI 5000亿美元的估值可能看起来被低估了。到那时，它的市销率只有5倍，这很便宜。如果是这样，那么未来几年 OpenAI 可能会获得更多动力。

<details>

<p class="english-text">The one thing he did say though later in the interview and we'll listen to some other parts of it in a bit is uh that we are on track to get 100 billion of revenue by 2027 which is a big deal. Uh I think that changed a lot of estimates. If they're underounting that 100 billion and it's actually going to be like 200 billion something like that. It really makes OpenAI at 500 billion probably look undervalued. At that point it's trading at 5x sales which is cheap. And you know, if that's the case, then you're likely going to get some more momentum out of OpenAI over the coming years.</p>

### 市场开盘表现与特朗普最新言论
好了，市场还有3分钟开盘。感谢大家的到来。隔夜市场开盘后，我们还有很多话题要谈。我认为市场会有一些大的波动，但标普期货上涨了0.3%，所以没什么太疯狂的预期。比特币和以太坊试图有所动作，但幅度不大。所以我们将在接下来的两分钟里看看市场如何开盘。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, that's what we got. All right, 3 minutes until the market opens. Thank you everybody for being here. We got a lot to talk about after these overnight markets. I think we're going to get some big moves up and down, but S&P's up.3% in the future, so there's nothing too crazy to expect. Uh, Bitcoin Ethereum tried to make a little bit of a move, but you know, they're not making too much move. So, we're going to see in the next two minutes how this market opens.</p>
</details>

特朗普刚刚结束了他的 CBS 采访，所以我会给你们一些采访的引述。我不能播放任何片段，因为 CBS 在版权方面非常严格，但我会给你们一些关于特朗普最新言论的数据，他谈了很多关于中国的话题，所以市场可能正在消化更多地缘政治稳定而非不稳定的因素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Trump just finished his CBS interview, so I'll get you some quotes from the interview. I can't play any clips because CBS is like really strong on the copyright, but I'll get you some data on uh the new quotes that we have from Trump, he talked a lot about China, and so the markets could be pricing in a little bit more of geopolitical stability versus instability.</p>
</details>

关于中国，说实话，11月最重要的事情甚至不是隔夜市场即将开盘，不是巴菲特的现金储备，也不是 OpenAI 或英伟达。真正重要的是，我们迎来了11月的全新开端。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In regards to China as well, honestly, the most important thing about November, it's not even really that the overnight markets are about to open. It's not Buffett's cash pile. It's not uh it's not OpenAI. It's not Nvidia. It's it's really not anything other than the fact that we have a new candle for November, folks.</p>
</details>

好了，5秒倒计时。让我们看看11月的隔夜市场将如何开盘。顺便说一下，如果对很多人来说我迟到了，很抱歉。美国实行了夏令时，我知道这会打乱世界上很多国际地区朋友的时间。所以从现在开始，我们每周日的直播都会在这个时间开始。标普指数上涨0.7%，报684点。我们看到了一个上涨的标普。SoFi 也上涨了约0.74%。AMD 上涨1.12%。Robinhood 报148美元，周五上涨了6%，表现不错。Palantir 报203美元，上涨1.2%。我们会做一个简短的 Palantir 预览。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, 5 seconds. Let's see what we got. Overnight markets for November are officially open. Here we go. By the way, sorry if I'm late for a lot of people. We had daylight savings in the United States. I know that kind of messes up the time for a bunch of people in the uh the international parts of the world, but yeah. So now we will officially be starting every Sunday at this time for you guys. S&P that's up 7% 684. We got a green S&P. SoFi is up about 74% as well. AMD that's up 1.12%. Hoodie 148 that did have a 6% move on uh on Friday which was very nice to see. Palunteer 203 that's up 1.2%. We will do a little bit of a pounder preview.</p>
</details>

英伟达上涨0.7%。我很高兴英伟达上涨了近1%，因为特朗普在CBS的采访中说，“我和Jensen谈过，我们都同意Blackwell不应该卖给我们的最大竞争对手。”我不知道Jensen是否同意Blackwell不应该卖给我们的竞争对手，我也不知道这对Blackwell芯片意味着什么，而且我绝对不认为我们短期内能从中国获得收入。Jensen在另一次采访中也有一些言论，我们稍后会看。但特朗普确实暗示，Blackwell可能短期内不会进入中国。所以，英伟达股价实际上涨而不是下跌，我认为这是个好现象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nvidia, that's up n7%. Now, I I'm I'm happy that Nvidia is up almost 1% because Trump did say in that CBS interview that um I talked to Jensen and essentially he said that we agreed that Blackwell should not be going well, he agreed. I don't know if Jensen agreed that Blackwell should not be going to our biggest competitors. I don't know what that necessarily means for Blackwell chips and I definitely don't think we're getting China revenue anytime soon. Jensen did have another interview that will look at it. well in a little bit. But, uh, Trump did kind of signal that, you know, maybe Blackwell is not going to be going to China anytime soon. So, the fact that Nvidia is actually up and not going down on that, I think is nice to see.</p>
</details>

### Jensen Huang谈美国制造与中国市场
好了，让我们深入探讨。我认为我们应该从 Jensen 的这次采访开始，因为它可能为我们接下来要讨论的很多事情定下基调。这是 Jensen 今天早上在福克斯新闻上的访谈，他谈到了关于中国、特朗普以及当前局势的所有事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, cool. So, let's get into it. I think we'll start off with uh this Jensen interview because this probably frames a lot of stuff that we got to talk about. So this was Jensen. He was on Fox this morning and this is everything that he had to say about China, Trump, what's going on.</p>
</details>

> 主持人: Jensen，在亚利桑那州生产这款 Blackwell 芯片有多困难？将如此重要的芯片生产带回美国，实现了怎样的成就？
> Jensen Huang: 首先，人工智能是一场工业革命，这是我们这个时代最重要的技术，甚至可能是所有时代中最重要的技术。当特朗普总统刚上任时，他希望我们在国内生产这些关键技术。他想让美国再工业化。他希望能源增长，希望确保美国在人工智能领域处于领先地位。为了做到这一点，我们需要在能源、芯片、构建AI基础设施和工厂方面领先，当然也包括构建AI模型，以及在医疗、制造、机器人、科学和工业等各个行业应用AI。他希望在他的政府任期内以光速实现这一切。所以我告诉他，通过与台积电（TSMC）的合作，我们将在9个月内将制造业带回美国。台积电是美国一个了不起的合作伙伴。还有富士康、纬创、安靠和日月光，我们现在已经能够在美国完全生产世界上最先进的AI芯片。在亚利桑那州，工人们非常努力，机械工程师、电工、水管工、建筑工人，他们夜以继日地工作。九个月后，我们现在已经量产了世界上最先进的AI芯片。
> 主持人: 在美国生产比在台湾生产要贵得多吗？
> Jensen Huang: 是的，在美国生产成本更高，但我们会随着时间的推移做得更好。将制造业迁回国内，建立首个此类工厂，成本会高一些，但这没关系。国家安全的好处、供应链弹性的好处、在美国创造就业的好处……我们将生产芯片系统，这些AI超级计算机将进入所谓的AI工厂，被美国的每一个行业使用。所以，随着时间的推移，我猜测这将创造数百万个就业岗位，而且是真正高质量的岗位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Tell me about manufacturing this Blackwell chip in Arizona Jensen. How difficult was that to achieve to bring such an important chip production here to America? >> Well, first of all, AI is a industrial revolution and this is the most important technology of our time, potentially the most important technology of all time. And when President Trump first took office, uh he wanted us to manufacture these critical technologies on shore. He wanted to re-industrialize the United States. He wants to have energy growth. He wants to make sure that United States is a leader in artificial intelligence. And in order to do in order to do so, we need to lead in energy. We need to lead in chips. We need to lead in building AI infrastructures and factories including lead in building AI models of course, but also using AI in all the different applications in various industries from healthcare to manufacturing to robotics to you know science and and industry. So uh he wanted he wanted that uh in his administration and he wanted it at the speed of light and so I told him that we would bring manufacturing back within 9 months with the partnership of TSMC which is an incredible partner for the United States Foxcon Wistron Amcor and Spill we've been able to manufacture now the most advanced AI chip in the world completely in the United States and Arizona the the the the the workers worked incredibly hard the mechanical engineers, the mechanical, the electricians, the plumbers, the construction workers, they all worked around the clock. Nine months later, we're now in volume production of the most advanced AI chip in the world. I >> Is it much more expensive to do it in the United States versus Taiwan? >> It is. It is more more expensive to do in the United States, but we're going to get better over time. you know, reman reonshoring manufacturing and the first uh plant of its kind. It's going to cost a little bit more money, but that's okay. the the uh the national security benefits uh the supply chain resilience benefits the job creation benefits here in the United States you know we're going to manufactured chips systems and those systems are going these these AI supercomputers are going to go into what are going to be AI factories which are going to be used by every single industry in the United States and so this is going to create over time you know my guess is millions of jobs, millions of jobs and really really high quality jobs, you know, from high really skilled trade craft. And</p>
</details>

所以你可以看到 Jensen 对美国制造业和再工业化部分非常兴奋，而这正是特朗普想听到的。当被问及这对英伟达的中国业务意味着什么时，他是这样具体回答的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> so you got Jensen obviously very excited about the American manufacturing and re-industrialization part and that is what Trump wants to hear. Here's what he had to say specifically when he was asked about what this means for the China part of Nvidia's business.</p>
</details>

> 主持人: （协议）将暂停相关出口管制的实施。这项协议对你和英伟达向中国销售产品意味着什么？
> Jensen Huang: 这真是一项了不起的成就。这是一次里程碑式的会晤，一项里程碑式的协议，一项历史性的协议。我读到的所有新闻报道都显示，两位总统之间，以及两国之间建立了相互尊重和友好的关系。这确实为英伟达创造了条件，我希望我们能重返中国市场进行竞争。在特朗普第45届政府期间，他为美国引领技术设定了完美的基调，确保美国公司拥有最好和最先的技术，并让美国科技公司走向世界去竞争和获胜。在过去的四年里，本届政府让我们走上了一条适得其反的道路。这些政策确实事与愿违。当特朗普总统离任时，我们在中国这个世界上最重要的市场之一拥有95%的市场份额，而现在英伟达在中国的市场份额是0%。所以，现在是时候了，这是一个绝佳的机会，让我们重置回特朗普第45届政府的政策，让美国AI公司能够去中国，在市场上竞争，并能够在全球范围内传播和推广美国的技术标准，以便我们能够制定全球标准，让世界建立在美国标准之上，从而引领世界。所以我认为这为我们创造了条件。我希望我们能够恢复到特朗普第45届政府的政策，重返市场并参与竞争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> We'll suspend the implementation of relevant export controls. What does this agreement mean for you and Nvidia with regard to selling to China? Well, what an achievement. This is a milestone meeting, a milestone deal, a historic deal. And the readouts uh from from all the news that I've read uh just the respectful uh the friendly relationship that they've built uh between the two presidents and of course between the two countries. Therefore, uh the the post from Secretary Heg Heath and uh and all the readouts from uh Secretary Bessant have have all been extraordinary. You know, this really creates the conditions I hope uh for Nvidia to be able to go back and compete in market in China. Trump 45 in the in President Trump's first administration. Uh he set the tone perfectly for America to lead in technology and make sure that America American companies have the best and first but for American technology companies to go around the world to compete and win. In the last four years, the administration really set us on a path that really backfired. the policies have really backfired from a 95% market share in in the China market which is one of the most important markets in the world when President Trump left office and video's market share in China is now 0%. And so this is really time and it's a great great opportunity for us to reset back to the Trump 45 policies for the Trump 45 policies where AI American AI companies are able to go around go to China compete for compete in the marketplace and be able to diffuse and and proliferate American technology standards around the world so that we could set global standards so that uh the world is built on American standards so that we could lead the world. And so I I think uh creates the conditions for us to do that. I hope we're able to to um revert back to the policies of the Trump 45 administration and and um get back get back into the market and compete.</p>
</details>

这是 Jensen 的评论。很多人将其解读为中国业务即将回归。显然，他并没有说中国业务会回归，他说的是希望特朗普和习主席的协议能为英伟达带来中国市场的收入，或者说希望英伟达能重获中国市场份额，因为现在他们的市场份额是零。然后，20分钟前，你听到了特朗普的这番话，这就是为什么我对英伟达在隔夜市场上涨感到惊讶。但这就是他对 Blackwell 芯片的确切说法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So that was the comment by Jensen. A lot of people interpreted that as China's coming back. Obviously he did not say China's coming back. He's saying hopefully the uh implications of the Trump and Xi deal will lead to China revenue or will will lead to China market share hopefully coming back for Nvidia because right now their market share is zero. And then 20 minutes ago you had this from Trump which is why I was surprised Nvidia is actually up in the overnight markets. But this is exactly what he said about Blackwell.</p>
</details>

> 主持人: 你打算和他（Jensen）会面吗？
> 特朗普: 我经常和他见面，他是我这个时代最伟大的天才之一。他的芯片比任何人都领先10年。他是一家伟大的美国公司，现在是世界上最大的公司。新出的 Blackwell 芯片比其他任何芯片都领先10年。但除了说声祝贺，没什么好见的。我们不把那款芯片给别人。
> 主持人: 我们不把那款芯片给别人？
> 特朗普: 我们不把那款芯片给别人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Nvidia smoke. What about it? >> So are you planning to meet with him? you said when you were >> I meet with look he's one of the great geniuses of our time his chips are 10 year years ahead of anybody else's and you know I meet with him all the time he's a great it's a great American company it's now the biggest company in the world uh so what would you like to know is a is really just a brilliant company the chips are 10 years the new blackwell that just came out it's 10 years ahead of every other chip But there's nothing to meet with other than say congratulations. >> But no, we don't give that chip to other people. >> We don't give that ship to other people. >> Are you meeting with the Syrian president at the White House? >> That last sentence, we don't give that chip to other people.</p>
</details>

所以，看，也许特朗普这么说只是因为他想在与中国的谈判中获得更多筹码。但正如你所见，他明确表示：“我们不把那款芯片给别人。”这意味着，如果特朗普对英伟达保持类似立场，Blackwell 芯片的收入很可能不会来自中国。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, look, maybe Trump is just saying that because he wants to get a little bit more of a negotiation on what we get with China. Uh, but as you can see, he clearly said, "We don't give that chip to other people." which means the blackwell chip is likely not coming back in terms of revenue if this is the similar stance that Trump is going to have on Nvidia.</p>
</details>

所以，即使特朗普赞扬英伟达，即使 Jensen 把 GTC 大会带到华盛顿，即使 Jensen 明显赞扬特朗普政府并表示他相信整个美国再工业化，如果特朗普不准备把 Blackwell 芯片给中国，我想象中国是想要这款芯片的。中国在夏天就已经表示，他们不想要任何比 Blackwell 差的东西，因为如果你给他们比 Blackwell 差的，他们还不如自己造芯片。这就造成了 Jensen 一直在谈论的整个问题，即美国技术不能成为全球 AI 技术的基础。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So even with the praise of Nvidia, even with Jensen bringing GTC to DC, even with Jensen obviously praising the Trump administration and saying that he believes in this whole American re-industrialization, if Trump is not ready to give the Blackwell chip to China, I would imagine China wants the chip and China has already said back in the summer they don't want anything less than Blackwell because if you give them something less than Blackwell, then they might as well just build their own chip, which creates the entire problem that Jensen's been talking about for American technology not being the foundation for overall AI technology around the world.</p>
</details>

### 中美贸易协议细节
那么，贸易关系到底发生了什么？这是昨晚发布的消息，公布在美国政府官网上，内容如下：中国将暂停新的稀土出口管制，将为稀土出口发放通用许可证，将采取重大措施阻止芬太尼流入美国，将暂停自3月4日以来的所有报复性关税，暂停自3月4日以来的所有报复性非关税措施，并购买至少1200万公吨的美国大豆。美国将把关税降低10%，从57%降至47%，将**301条款**（Section 301: 美国《1974年贸易法》中的一个条款，授权美国总统对被认定为不公平或歧视性的外国贸易行为采取报复措施）关税豁免的到期日延长至2026年11月。这是白宫昨天发布的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now what actually happened with the trade relations? So this came out last night. This was published on the US.gov website and this is exactly what they said. The Chinese are going to suspend new rare earth export controls. They're going to issue general licenses for exports of rare earths. They're going to take significant measures to end the flow of fentinel to the US. They're going to suspend all retaliatory tariffs since March 4th. suspend all retaliatory non-tariff measures since March 4th and purchase at least 12 million metric tonses of US soybeans. The US is going to lower tariffs by 10% from uh 57 to 47, extend the expiration of section 301 tariff exclusions until November 2026 published by the White House yesterday.</p>
</details>

所以，协议中没有任何内容表明中国将正式获得 Blackwell 芯片，但我认为这让市场松了一口气，因为现在看来年底不会爆发大规模的贸易战。当然，中国方面还需要确认这一点，但我认为他们已经购买了一些大豆以示诚意。考虑到上周我们报道的谈判情况，似乎一切都相对平稳，而那种让全球都感到恐慌的稀土出口管制可能不会发生了，这或许是件好事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So nothing in that says that China will officially get Blackwell, but I think it's giving the market a lot of ease now that there's not this massive trade war that might break out towards the end of the year. Obviously, the Chinese have to confirm this, but I think they already bought some soybeans as a sign of good faith. And, you know, given the negotiations that happened last week that we covered, it seems like everything is relatively okay and the export controls on rare earths that kind of really got everyone scared globally might not be happening and as a result, you know, that might be the good thing.</p>
</details>

### 分化的美国经济：消费疲软与“财富效应”
现在，很多人在问：“中国从这个协议中得到了什么？”这是一个很好的问题，因为除了关税降低，我真的不知道中国从中得到了什么。他们获得了进入美国消费市场的机会，这非常重要，他们的经济也需要这个，因为过去几年他们一直处于衰退中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, a lot of people are saying, "What does China get from that deal?" I mean, it's a good point because outside of the tariff reduction, I don't really know what China is getting from that deal. I mean, they get access to the US consumer, which is very important, and their economy needs that because they've been in a recession over the past couple years.</p>
</details>

这引出了关于经济状况的讨论。上周很多股票都受到了冲击，其中很多是面向消费者的股票，这表明实体经济可能存在一些问题，即便华尔街尚未感受到。

> 主持人: 你是否同意美国面临衰退风险？
> 嘉 宾: 我认为我们正处于一个过渡期。我们看到特朗普政府削减了政府开支。在政府停摆期间，一个被忽视的事实是，截至9月30日的财年，政府支出比前一年要少。由于GDP增长，赤字占GDP的比重从6.4%-6.5%（这是我们在非战争、非衰退时期有史以来的最高水平）降至5.9%。所以我们正在削减政府开支。我认为美联储会希望协助这一过程，因为麻省理工学院刚发布的一项研究表明，2022年大通胀的42%来自过度的政府支出。因此，如果我们正在收缩开支，那么通胀应该会下降。如果通胀下降，那么美联储就应该降息。
> 主持人: 如果劳动力市场疲软，人们失业，他们就不会花那么多钱，这也应该有助于创造更多的通缩，这是美联储应该降息的另一个原因。
> 嘉 宾: 我认为我们状况良好，但我认为经济的某些部门正处于衰退之中。美联储的政策造成了很多分配问题。我们看到，对住房最大的阻碍是抵押贷款利率。所以，如果美联储降低抵押贷款利率，他们就可以结束这场住房衰退。在拜登总统任下，低收入消费者受到了沉重打击，这些高利率正在伤害他们，因为他们有债务，而不是资产。所以我认为经济的某些部分可能会陷入衰退。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Voted to lower interest rates another quarter of a point to its lowest level in three years. However, the central bank's newest official, Steven Myron, is is warning that if the Fed doesn't continue to lower interest rates rapidly, the US could face a recession. Do you agree that the US is at risk of facing a recession? Uh I I believe that we are in a transition period here as we are seeing the Trump administration has cut back on government spending. Jake what has gone unnoticed during the shutdown is the for the fiscal year that in September 30th the government spent less than it did the year before and because the GDP grew the GDP which had been 6.4 the deficit to GDP which had been 6.4 4 6.5% deficit, the highest when we weren't at war, weren't in a recession ever. We were able to bring it down to 5.9%. So, we are bringing down government spending. And I would think that the Fed would want to assist with that because if we go back and look, MIT just published a study that said 42% of the great inflation of 2022 came from excess government spending. So if we are contracting spending then I would think inflation would be dropping. If inflation is dropping then the Fed should be cutting rates. >> Also if the labor market is weak and people are losing jobs they're not spending as much which should also help to create a little bit more deflation which is another reason the Fed should be cutting rates. >> But do you think that the US is at risk of a recession if the Fed does not continue to drop rates? Uh I I think that we are in good shape, but I think that there are sectors of the economy that are in recession and you know the Fed has caused a lot of distributional problems the with their policies. I you know I wrote a 7,000word essay on that. You know we've seen the the biggest hindrance for housing here that are are mortgage rates. So, you know, if the Fed brings down mortgage rates, then they can end this housing recession. Low-income consumers who have gotten killed under President Biden, the these high rates are hurting them because they have debt, not assets. So, I think that there are sections of the economy that could go into recession. All right.</p>
</details>

为什么要理解这一点？看看这些数据。这是一些非常重要的消费类股票年初至今的回报率。Chipotle，我们上周都看到了他们的财报，CEO亲口说，年收入低于10万美元、年龄在25到34岁之间的人进店次数减少了。Wendy's 今年下跌了44%。Lululemon 简直是一场灾难，下跌了54%。Whirlpool 下跌35%，尽管他们的财报不错。Macy's 下跌27%。Caesars 下跌38%。Under Armour 下跌36%。当你看到这些消费股时，情况有点难看。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Okay. Now, why is that really important to understand? Well, I'm about to show something right here and uh for those that haven't seen this aggregated data, it's actually really really important to to take a look at. So, so take a look at this right here. These are the year-to-ate returns on some very important consumer stocks. Chipotle, we all saw last week what happened with their earnings. The CEO literally said people making less than 100,000 from ages 25 to 34 are not entering the store as much. Wendy's was down 44% this year. I didn't even know that was the case. Lululemon, that's been a train wreck, down 54%. Whirlpool down 35%, although they did have good earnings. Macy's down 27%. Caesars down 38%. Under Arour down 36. I mean, it's a little ugly when you look at these consumer stocks.</p>
</details>

这里有另一张图表显示了更多信息。金宝汤公司、通用磨坊、卡夫亨氏、高露洁、宝洁。这些是今年表现最差的股票。这里有两个微妙的观点。第一，这些公司是世界上最好的公司吗？可能不是。我想英伟达、微软、亚马逊、谷歌等公司的执行力要比宝洁和 Lululemon 好得多。但第二点，我认为人们开始怀疑消费者状况的原因是，这些都是面向消费者的公司，而且不仅仅是 Chipotle。还有很多其他快餐品牌，比如 Shake Shack，虽然它不完全是低端消费，但它的股票今年一直受到冲击。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's another chart that shows even more. the Camples company, General Mills, Craft Hind, Colgate, uh, Proctor and Gamble. These have been the worst performing stocks of the entire year. So, there's two kind of nuanced points around this. Number one is has has have these companies been the best companies in the world. Probably not. I would imagine Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, etc. are executing a lot better than Proctor and Gamble and and Lululemon. So, that that's the first point. But second of all, the reason I think people are starting to wonder what's going on with the consumer is because these are consumer oriented companies and it's not just Chipotle. There's a lot of other fast food brands. I mean, Shake Shack, which is, you know, not really for the low end of the consumer, but uh their stock has been hit all year.</p>
</details>

所以问题是，经济到底怎么了？我们一直在讨论这个问题。正如 Gerald 在这里所说，人们确实在受苦。我认为即使我们是资产持有者，也不能忽视经济中有人在受苦这个事实。这就是为什么有人会问，如果我们不降息，而你看到 Chipotle 今年下跌了45%，一周内下跌了20%，那么那些需要通过再融资来减轻个人贷款或汽车贷款压力的低端消费者会怎么样？汽车贷款违约率，尤其是次级贷款，一直不容乐观。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the question is what's going on in the economy? And we've been talking about this for a long time. As Gerald says right here, people are definitely hurting. And I don't think even if we are asset holders, we can ignore the fact that obviously people are hurting in this economy. Which is why Bent was asked this question. Wait a second. If we don't cut rates and you're seeing Chipotle take a 45% draw down this year, 20% in a week, like what's going on for the low end of the consumer that likely needs to get a little bit of relief on their personal loan payment to refinance it or their auto loan payment? Auto loan delinquencies have, you know, not been the best, especially subprime.</p>

这引出了关于“财富效应”的讨论。以下是本周末《The Compound and Friends》节目中一个两到三分钟的片段，讨论了财富效应这个概念，因为这似乎是经济得以支撑的原因。

<p class="english-text">This leads into the conversation around the wealth effect. Here is a two to three minute clip from the compound and friends this weekend talking about this idea of the wealth effect because again that is why it looks like the economy is holding up.</p>
</details>

> 嘉宾: 我想深入探讨一下，因为这是我每周都愿意为之辩护的观点。我是财富效应的忠实信徒。我认为它是经济中最重要的因素，没有之一。它决定了就业，决定了人们是否能加薪，我认为它还决定了资本支出项目。没有什么比股价下跌30%更能迅速阻止AI资本支出了。所以，我认为我们低估了股市影响实体经济的能力。比以往任何时候都多的美国人拥有401k。我理解住房对中产阶级来说是更大的资产，等等。我都明白。但那些为别人工作的人，他们关心自己所在公司的股票期权。我认为这是一个巨大的驱动力。
> 嘉宾: 福特和通用汽车本周创下了52周新高。这背后的故事是什么？是财富效应让人们去经销商那里买一辆新的F-150，而不是贸易战的胡说八道。这些公司处理这场关税战处理得非常好，不是因为他们能控制采购物资的价格，而是因为需求从未减弱。

<p class="english-text">>> I want to double click on that because like this is the hill that I like to die on every week. I'm a wealth effect truther. I think it's the number one most important factor in the economy, bar none. It decides employment. It decides whether or not people get wage increases. I think it decides capex spending projects. Nothing will halt AI capex in its tracks faster than a stock price that falls 30%. Nothing. And so, as a result, I really think we underpric the ability of the stock market to influence things that happen in the real economy. Um, more Americans than ever are in 401ks. I understand housing is a bigger asset for the middle class, blah blah blah. I get all that. The people that work for people though, those people, they care about their stock options in the companies they work for. I just I think it's a huge driver. To that point, Sean and I uh on my research team, we write this column for CNBC Pro every week, uh best stocks in the market, and we're always looking for charts that invalidate things that we believed or things other people believed. We love that more than anything. We did a spotlight on Ford and GM today. Ford and GM made 52 week highs this week. >> Yeah. What's the story there? The story there is the wealth effect is what sends people to the dealership to buy a new F-150. Not trade war [ __ ] These companies have handled this tariff war handled this this tariff situation so well, not because they're in control of the prices of of the supplies they buy, but because the demand never let up.</p>
</details>

我认为这是一个非常重要的观点。福特和通用汽车的表现，至少通用汽车今年已经超过了特斯拉。福特的股价基本上处于两年来的高位。为什么？因为他们能卖出更多的车。为什么能卖出更多的车？因为人们有更多的钱，不仅仅是来自薪水，还因为他们持有资产。即使只是他们的401k，他们也感觉更富有了。这就是财富效应的整个概念。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I I and I I think this is a really important point. Ford and GM have out or GM has at least outperformed Tesla this year. Ford's basically trading at a two-year high. Why? They're able to sell more cars. Why are they able to sell more cars? Because people have more money, not just because of their paychecks, but because they're holding on to assets. Even if it's just their 401k, they feel richer. That's the whole concept of the wealth effect.</p>

### 科技巨头与市场展望
这背后有一个重要的数据。35岁左右的人，他们净资产中股票的比例是23%。而对于婴儿潮一代，当他们35岁时，这个比例是7%。这是一个巨大的差异。所以，当股市由科技股引领时，大多数35岁及以下的人投资的正是英伟达、特斯拉、亚马逊这些他们真正理解的公司。这些公司的股价上涨，表现良好。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And what's really important is another stat from the show that was that was just very intriguing to me. People in their early 30s or I think it's mid-30s, 35 years old, they their percentage of uh equities as a percentage of their net worth in this generation. So I guess millennials you can call it 23%. So if you are around 35 in that you know early 30s range, mid-30s range, 23% of your net worth on an aggregate is in equities. For the boomers when they were 35 years old, it was 7%. That is a massive difference, right? And so when you have a stock market with technology stocks that are leading the way, most people 35 and younger, right? Nvidia, Tesla, Amazon, the companies that they actually understand, the companies that they can see the technology in front of their face, those are the companies they're investing in, those are the companies that have gone up, those are the companies that have done well.</p>
</details>

看看这个数据。美国四大科技公司——亚马逊、谷歌、苹果和微软——在过去12个月的总收入达到了创纪录的1.8万亿美元。亚马逊6910亿，苹果4160亿，谷歌3860亿，微软2940亿。我正在写一篇 Substack 文章，下周发布，主题是大型科技公司可能成为我们一生中最简单的投资。当你看到这样的图表，再看到大多数人配置的都是这些公司，而不是强生、宝洁或 Lululemon，而是亚马逊、苹果、谷歌和微软，这就很能说明问题。苹果上周创下历史新高，考虑到他们的增长并不快，这简直太疯狂了，但因为它是苹果，估值就被接受了。

<p class="english-text">Take a look at this. The combined revenues of the big four US tech companies, Amazon, Google, Apple, and Microsoft, hit a record 1.8 trillion over the last 12 months. Amazon at 691 billion, Apple 416, Google 386, Microsoft 294. I'm working on a Substack piece coming out in the next week about how the big tech companies might be the easiest investments of our lifetime. And when you see charts like this and then when you see that most people have allocation to these companies, not Johnson and Johnson or Proctor and Gamble or Lululemon, but rather Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft. Apple hit a new all-time high last week, which is just wild given that they're not growing that much, but still the multiple gets baked in because it's Apple at the end of the day. It's just incredible to see.</p>

所以，当有人说美联储可能需要继续降息，当我们都开始想12月是否会降息时，我认为上周鲍威尔在新闻发布会开始时就强调12月不会降息，这简直是可笑的。目前，12月10日会议降息的概率是69.3%。在鲍威尔上台说“别指望12月降息”之前，这个数字是90%。降息是板上钉钉的事。我们知道劳动力市场疲软，知道底层消费者显然在挣扎，他们需要某种形式的救济，也就是降息。

<p class="english-text">And so, as a result of that, uh, you know, when Bent says the Fed's probably got to keep cutting and when all of us start wondering, are we going to get this December cut? I mean, I think it was laughable and I genuinely think it was laughable last week that Bent or not Benta Powell started off the press conference by trying to stress that this December cut is not going to happen. Right now, the probability for a December cut, it's going to be December 10th is the meeting is 69.3%. That number was 90% before Powell uh went on stage and said, you know, don't expect a December cut is in the books. It's in the books. We know the labor market is weak. We know that the bottom end of the consumer is obviously struggling and they're going to need some type of relief aka rate cuts.</p>

### 11月市场历史表现与前瞻
让我们看一些关于11月的图表。11月通常表现相当不错。自1927年以来，标普500指数在59%的11月份都收高。在这些年份里，该指数平均回报率为1%。纳斯达克100指数平均上涨2.4%。在美国总统周期的第一年，也就是我们现在所处的2025年，11月也一直很强劲，标普500指数有67%的时间是上涨的。自1950年以来，当标普500指数进入11月时年初至今涨幅超过15%，那么11月的平均回报率为2.7%。目前，标普500指数上涨了18%。所以从历史上看，我们可能会在11月迎来一个2.5%的涨幅，这将使我们远超7000点。

<p class="english-text">Let's get into some charts about November. So November tends to be pretty damn good. Take a look at this. Since 1927, the S&P 500, uh the S&P 500 has ended higher 59% of November. So 59% of the time you tend to get a higher November that is actually a much higher rate than October. During these years, the index averages an average of one or returned an average of 1%. The NASDAQ 100 has seen 2.4%. The Russell 2000 2.64. In year one of a US presidential cycle, which we are in right now, 25, November has also been strong with the S&P 500 going up about 67% of the time. Uh, or it's up 67% 67% of the time. I know the 67s, I get it. I'm going to see thousands of those in a second. But, uh, ironically, the S&P rise is 67% of the time. up 067% on average in November. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has been up more than 15% year-to date. Heading into November, it's returned 2.7%. Right now, the S&P 500 is up 18%. So, historically, we could get a two and two two and a half% month going into November, which would put us well over 7,000.</p>

### 关键财报前瞻：Palantir
好了，Palantir，我们来谈谈。首先，谁感到兴奋？我们稍后会谈 Grab，但 Palantir 的财报就在明天。我想这应该是我在频道上公开报道的第18个季度了，有点疯狂。但我确实很兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, Palinger, let's talk about it. Let's talk about it. First of all, who's excited? Who's excited? We'll talk about Grab after, but Palanteer is tomorrow. I think this is officially the 18th quarter I'll be covering publicly on the channel. It's kind of crazy, dude. Um, but I am pretty excited for it.</p>
</details>

我之所以兴奋，是因为我周末看了数据。Seeking Alpha 上有盈利预期，华尔街的预期是10.9亿美元。Palantir 的指引基本上就是10.9亿美元。所以分析师们并没有真正提高预期，他们基本上是在赌公司会符合指引。过去10个季度他们基本都是这么做的。而 Palantir 做了什么？他们每次都超出预期并上调指引，以至于分析师们完全搞错了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the reason I am excited for it is because I looked at the numbers over the weekend. Again, if you haven't watched Paler Weekly, make sure to check that out. We went pretty deep onto the numbers and, you know, tried to give as much of an explanation as we can for what we think is going to happen. Seeking Alpha that I'm pulling up right here has the earnings estimates and the estimates from Wall Street is 1.09. 9 billion. Pounder basically guided for 1.09 billion. So, uh, the analysts aren't really raising the estimate from the company. They're basically betting that the company is going to come in line with guidance. And they've done this for basically the past 10 quarters. And what has Palanteer done? They've uh beat and raised to such a degree that the analysts completely got it wrong.</p>
</details>

那么股价会怎么样？我不知道，因为股价已经涨了一波了。过去几周，我在170到185美元区间买入 Palantir 的理由是，我认为当华尔街看到50%的增长时，他们会很兴奋，股价可能会上涨。但这已经发生了。对上涨的预期已经兑现。现在的问题是，这个季度的财报要好到什么程度，才能让股价涨得比现在更高。如果 Palantir 明天跌到185美元，我也不会太难过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, what's going to happen to the stock? I have no idea because the stock already made a run. I mean, I really for the past couple weeks, the reason I've been buying pounder around that 170 to 185 range is like, hey, I think when the street sees 50% growth, uh, they're going to be excited and the stock probably makes a move higher. That has already happened. So, the anticipation of the move has already taken place. The question now becomes how good is the quarter going to be to get the move to be even better than what we see right here. And if pounder drops to 185 tomorrow, like I can't be that upset about it.</p>
</details>

我认为他们会达到12亿美元的营收，也就是超出预期1亿美元。如果他们能超出1亿美元，我们看到12亿的营收，每股收益接近25美分而不是17美分，如果他们的增长率能接近55%到57%，而他们现在的指引是50%，那将是7%到8%的超出。老兄，我认为华尔街会再次说：“等等，这是唯一一家增长如此之快的公司。这是唯一一家真正将AI付诸实践并使其有用的公司。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think they're going to come in to 1.2 billion. I think they're going to beat by 100 million. And I think if they beat by a hundred million and we get 1.2 billion and we get closer to 25 cents versus 17 cents, again, I I just like if they grow anywhere near 55 to 57% right now, they're got to get 50%. So they would have to have a little bit of a 7 to 8% beep. I mean, dude, like I Wall Street, I think once again, will say, "Wait a second. This is the only company that's growing as fast as they're growing. This is the only company that's actually implementing AI to make it useful."</p>
</details>

如果 OpenAI 想要万亿美元的估值，我知道他们的增长指标从总收入美元角度看更好，但从影响力角度看，有人可能会说 Palantir 的影响力更大。而且 Palantir 只有900个客户。这可能是他们第一个季度新增100个客户。他们从未新增过三位数的客户。如果他们新增100个客户，并且新增了更多至少100万美元的合同，再加上55%到57%的营收增长，我认为股价可以更高，华尔街会非常喜欢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If OpenAI wants a trillion dollar valuation, I mean, I know their metrics are better from a growth perspective than from a total dollar revenue perspective, but from an impact perspective, one could say that Pounder is having more of an impact. And Pounder only has 900 customers in terms of customer count. We talked about this a lot on the weekly. This might be the first quarter where they add 100 customers. They've never added a triple digit number of customers. I think last quarter they added 77. If they add uh 100 and they have more deals of at least a million that was added. I think last quarter they have like 150. If that gets closer to like 175 and they have that topline revenue growth of 55 to 57%. I think the stock can go higher and I think the street will really like it.</p>
</details>

### 关键财报前瞻：Grab
好了，Grab。我们用 Grab 来结束今天的节目。我为 Grab 明天的财报感到兴奋。我在我的 Substack 上发布了深度分析报告，并在其中披露我现在持有超过4万股。所以，我带着一个相当重的仓位迎接这次财报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, Grabby Grab. We'll end off the show with Grabby Grab. Um, I'm excited for Grab tomorrow. I posted on my Substack, the deep dive. I disclosed on that Substack. I now have over 40,000 shares. So, your boy's walking in with a pretty heavy bag for uh for this earnings.</p>
</details>

听着，关于 Grab，我整个周末都在想。我不知道股价会怎么样，真的不知道。我的直觉告诉我，他们会有一个很棒的季度，会超出预期并上调指引。**EBITDA**（Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization: 税息折旧及摊销前利润，是衡量公司核心盈利能力的指标）指引会接近5亿美元，股价会比现在高得多，我想到达6.8到6.9美元的区间，也许会突破7美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look, dude. The thing about Grab, and I've been thinking about this all weekend. I've been thinking about this all weekend. I don't know what's going to happen to the stock. I really don't. My gut, like like like like my gut is telling me they're going to have a great quarter. They're going to beat and raise. Ebida guidance is going to get closer to 500 million and the stock's going to go much higher than where it is today. I'm thinking around that 680 690 range. Maybe it crosses seven. seven might be psychological, but I think we get above 650,</p>
</details>

但这是我的直觉。我的理智告诉我，财报在7:30发布，没有券商关心 Grab，没有庞大的散户社区。从晚上7:30到8:00，在流动性极差的盘后市场，很难有任何大的波动。而且这是一家在新加坡时间早上8点发布财报的国际股票。所以，可能美国没有足够多的人知道明天有财报。因此，我有点觉得股价会持平或者下跌，因为成交量不大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but that's what my gut tells me. What my mind tells me is that the earnings come out at 7:30. None of the brokerages care about Grab. There's not a massive retail community. You have 7:30 to 8:00 p.m. in the overnight markets or in the after hours markets that are highly illquid for any massive move to happen up or down. Uh, and then it's a it's an international stock that's reporting earnings at 8 am Singapore time. So, like there might not be enough people in the United States that even know that the earnings is happening tomorrow. And so, I kind of think that the stock's going to be flat or it's going to be red because there's just not a lot of volume that's going to be coming in because you're going to have 30 minutes to make a move on the stock because the earnings come out at 7:30 and overnight markets close at or overnight markets open at 800 p.m., but after hours close at 8 p.m. and grabbers and trade in the overnight markets.</p>
</details>

我认为财报必须非常出色，才能让股价真正突破7美元。根据数据，我认为这种走势是可能的。但话又说回来，我可能错了。如果明天没有发生，那也不会改变我的投资逻辑，这只是一个关于公众对 Grab 看法的认知问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I I think the earnings would have to be so substantial to get the stock to really make the move above $7, which I like I look based on the numbers. If you look at that substack, I went through even more numbers over the weekend. I I really do think that move is possible. But then again, I could be wrong. And if it doesn't happen tomorrow, then it doesn't really change my thesis. It's just a question of, you know, the public perception of what's going to happen in the context of graph.</p>
</details>

但最终，关于这只股票，这是我将自己的品牌与之关联的第三只股票。我一遍又一遍地研究了数据，我相信它被低估了。我看了多个**DCF**（Discounted Cash Flow: 现金流折现法，一种通过预测公司未来现金流并将其折现到当前价值来评估公司价值的方法）模型，我认为公允价值接近9到10美元。我看了机构持股量，这只股票84%由机构持有。我不明白为什么机构一直在买入，而股价却一直低迷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But again, I've gone through the numbers over and over again. I believe it's undervalued. I've looked at multiple DCFs. I think fair value is closer to 910 bucks. I've looked at the institutional volume. This thing is owned by 84% of the institutions. It does not make sense to me for why the institutions have been buying as much uh and for the stock to stay depressed.</p>
</details>

Grab 拥有70亿美元现金，增长23%，收入重新加速，调整后 EBITDA 创历史新高，自由现金流为正，GAAP 盈利，公司五年来首次拥抱媒体。所有这些因素加在一起，如果明天股价不动，而财报只是符合预期，甚至可能像过去几个季度一样超出预期并上调指引，我也不会抱怨。除非有明显的危险信号让我看到股价与实际机会之间的脱节，否则我不会质疑我的投资逻辑。到目前为止，Grab 还没有给我理由去质疑。但我们将在财报中见分晓。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">With Grab, you have a company with 7 billion in cash growing 23% reacelerating their revenues, adjusted EBA hitting all-time highs, free cash flow, gap profitable, you know, the company's embracing media for the first time in five years. All these things coming together to me, if the stock doesn't move tomorrow and the earnings are just in line with expectations and probably beating and raising like they have for the past couple quarters, I'm not going to complain about it and I I'll take all the shots that people want to take about the stock not moving. That's fine. But I'm not going to sit here and question my thesis unless there is a reason to question it. And so far, Grab hasn't given me a reason. But we're going to see on the earnings and uh if that reason can continue.</p>
</details>

好了，各位。这就是我们今天的内容。感谢大家的到来。希望大家度过了一个愉快的周日。我们正在进入今年的最后两个月，这有点疯狂。明天早上市场开盘时我会回来。明天是重要的一天，有 Palantir 和 Grab 的财报，本周还有很多财报。我们将看看这一切如何发展。

<p class="english-text">All right, guys. That's what we got. That's what we got. Thank you everybody for being here. Hopefully, everyone had a good Sunday. We are getting into the last two months of the year, which is kind of crazy. Any expectations for Tesla November 6. I think the shareholders will vote with Elon. And I do not think Elon's going to miss out on this trillion dollar compensation package. And it's going to be very exciting to watch Elon go to work over the next 10 years and try to take Tesla literally to the moon and become one of the most valuable companies on the planet. But I think he'll get an overwhelming amount of the votes. I'm not too worried about what should be happening with uh with Tessie. All right, guys. That's it. Thank everybody. I'll be back tomorrow morning. Market open. Big day tomorrow. We got Palenteer. We got Grab. Got a lot of earnings this week. We're going to see how this ends up playing out.</p>
</details>

再次提醒，关于 Grab 和 Nebius 的两份深度分析报告已经发布。BMR 和 Duolingo 的报告也在 Substack 上。如果你还没读过，我真的很喜欢这次的写作。接下来两份深度报告可能是 Reddit 和 Iren。我将花接下来两周时间研究它们，希望11月15日能发布。

<details>

Took me a lot of time. I think the next two deep dives are going to be Reddit and Iran. So, I'm spending the next two weeks on those and hopefully those are out November 15th.</p>
