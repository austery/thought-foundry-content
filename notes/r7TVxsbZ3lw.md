### 十一月开局与市场展望

大家好，欢迎回到新一期的周日市场期货直播。我们提前了三分钟，因为我已经准备好了，所以我们不妨直接开始。感谢大家的到来，希望各位度过了一个愉快的周末。朋友们，十一月正式开始了，这感觉有点疯狂。2025年只剩下两个月了，今天是11月2日。这一年过得相当快。十月份的股市跌宕起伏，上周我们有很多内容要讨论，包括美联储和大型科技公司的财报。但十月已经结束，我们进入了新的月份。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the Sunday market futures. We are live. We are three minutes early. I was like, you know what? I'm ready to go. we might as well get started. And we are here. Thank everybody for being here. Hope everyone had a great weekend. We've got November officially starting, folks. It's kind of crazy. It really is kind of crazy. We got two months left of 2025. It is November 2nd. Uh this year has gone relatively quick. I mean, October was up and down in regards to the stock market. We had a ton of stuff to cover last week with the Fed and big tech earnings, but October is done and we're here. We are live.</p>
</details>

我们有很多话题要谈。周末期间，有很多新访谈在网上疯传，特别是关于 Sam Altman 和 Satya Nadella 的。我们将会讨论这个。特朗普正在接受 CBS《60分钟》的特别采访，所以在这期市场期货节目进行期间，可能会有很多他的言论流出。实际上，我们已经开始看到一些言论了，已经有几个采访片段。所以在整个小时里，你可能会听到很多不同的引述，我会把它们放在屏幕上，我们一起分析。就在大约五分钟前，特朗普发推文说，如果没有关税生效，我们将成为一个第三世界国家。最高法院本周将审理关税案件，所以这非常重要。我们也会谈到这个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We got a lot to talk about. We have a bunch of different things that went viral over the weekend in regards to new interviews, particularly around Sam Alman and Satia Nadella. So, we're going to talk about that. Uh, we got Trump who's doing a CBS 60inut special interview right now. So, there's likely going to be a ton of quotes coming in uh throughout the course of this uh market future show. I mean, we're already getting quotes right now. We have a couple of clips already from the interview. So throughout the entire hour, you're probably going to get a bunch of different quotes and I will put them on the screen and we'll analyze what's going on. Trump already tweeted like five minutes ago that we will be a third world country without the tariffs going into effect. The Supreme Court will be looking at the tariffs case this week. So that's going to be really important. So we'll talk about that.</p>
</details>

然后我们还有巴菲特的一些更新。他的伯克希尔·哈撒韦公司公布了财报。这将是沃伦·巴菲特和伯克希尔·哈撒韦的最后一个第三季度财报。所以我们会谈谈他们的一些举措。我们还有一系列宏观数据和图表需要关注，以预测十一月份的市场走势。明天，Palantir 将公布财报。所以我们会对此做一个简短的预览。没错，今天是 Palantir 财报前夜。这应该是我第18个季度报道 Palantir 的财报了，感觉很疯狂。而且坦白说，这可能是他们最好的一个季度。我们也会谈到 Grab。所以，这将是内容非常丰富的一周。明天有 Palantir 和 Grab 的财报，绝对会非常疯狂，我们会对即将发生的事情做一个预览。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh and then we got some updates from Buffett. He had earnings with Bergkshire Hathway. This is the last Q3 ever for Warren Buffett and Birkshshire Hathway. So we'll talk about some of the stuff they did. We have a bunch of different macro stats to look at, some charts in regards to what to expect in November. And then tomorrow, you've got Palunteer earnings. So, we're going to do a little bit of a preview on that. It is indeed happy Palunteer Eve. This is what this is the uh 4812 uh 15. This is I think the 18th quarter I've covered for Pounder. Just kind of crazy. And quite frankly, it might be the best quarter. So, we're going to talk about that. And then we got Grabby Grab as well. So, I mean, this is going to be a jam-packed week. Tomorrow is going to be absolutely insane with Palunteer and Grab, and we'll do a preview on what's going on with that.</p>
</details>

### 公司深度分析：Nebius 与 Grab

在我们开始之前，我发布了两篇新的深度分析文章，分别是关于 Nebius 和 Grab 的。Grab 是我大约三个月前写过一篇17页深度分析的公司。我在周末对它进行了修订，并正式发布在了 Substack 上。链接就在那里，大家可以去看看，免费订阅，没有付费墙。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But, we have a lot a lot a lot to talk about. So, thank you everybody for being here. Before we get started, deep dives are out. Two new deep dives. We have Nebas and Grabby. Grab is a uh company that I I did a 17page deep dive on about three months ago. I I I refined the deep dive over the weekend and I officially published it on Substack. Uh, and so there's the link right there. You guys can check it out. Free to subscribe. Uh, no payw wall, anything like that.</p>
</details>

很多人都在询问 Nebius。我研究了一下 Nebius，明天会更详细地谈论它。也许我们可以在节目最后，如果大家有问题的话，再聊聊。从一个简单的角度来看，真的很难不看好 Nebius，因为它是一个全栈集成的数据中心解决方案。我认为那些在它股价20美元时就理解了这个论点的多头们，已经获得了丰厚的回报。显然，我当时没有理解这个逻辑，也没有真正关注它。在 Substack 文章的前半部分，大约前八段，我谈到了我可能错过这个投资机会的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then Nebius, a lot of people were asking for it. And I looked at Nebas and I'll talk about it more tomorrow. Maybe we can talk about at the end of the show if people have some questions. Uh, look, it is really hard to not be bullish on Nebus Nebius from the simple perspective that it is a full stack integrated approach to data centers. And I think the bulls that understood that argument back when it was $20 have been supremely rewarded for it. Uh, I obviously did not understand that thesis, nor did I really pay attention to it. And then the first half of the the Substack or I guess the first kind of like eight paragraphs of the article, I talk about why I likely missed the story.</p>
</details>

但在130美元的价位，我计算了一下，数字就在 Substack 的文章里，其实并没有那么可怕。当然，他们能否再获得一个**超大规模云服务商**（Hyperscaler: 指的是像亚马逊AWS、微软Azure和谷歌云这样提供大规模计算和存储服务的公司）的交易存在很大的执行风险。但在94美元时，它确实是一个很好的买入点，不幸的是我当时只是卖出了看跌期权。但老实说，在130美元，它并没有那么可怕。执行力是最大的风险。但我确实认为这家公司有护城河。我认为这是我一直以来对 Nebius 最关心的问题，他们是否有护城河，还是只是另一个数据中心公司？我认为他们有。因此，这很令人兴奋。我还没有持仓，我在文章中谈到了为什么我还没有持仓，但它已经进入我2026年的观察名单，我们会看看后续发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, but at 130, look, I did the numbers. The numbers are in the chat or in in the in the chat in the substack. It's not that scary. It really isn't. Now, there is a large execution risk on if they can get another hyperscaler deal, but I mean at 94 it was a really good buy and unfortunately I just sold puts on it. But at 130, honestly, it's not that scary. The execution is the biggest risk. But I do think the company has a moat. And I think that's the biggest thing I've been concerned about, Neb, is like, do they have a moat or are they just another data center plate? I think they have a moat. And as a result, uh, it's exciting. So, I don't have a position yet. I talk about why I don't have a position in the article, but it is on my list for 2026, and we're going to see what goes on from there.</p>
</details>

### 盘前市场动态与中美协议

好了，我们开始吧。感谢大家的到来。再过几分钟，隔夜市场就要开盘了，我们会看看情况如何。我还没看 IREN，它和 Reddit 都在我的观察名单上。我想接下来几周可能会深度分析这两家公司。我知道在分析完 Nebius 之后，Nebius 和 IREN 之间存在一些奇怪的争议。Nebius 的多头讨厌 IREN，而 IREN 的多头也讨厌 Nebius。所以我想我现在必须对 IREN 做一个深度分析了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, let's get started. Thank you everybody for being here. In 14 minutes, we are going to get the overnight markets to open and uh we're going to see what happens in overnight. I have not looked at IN yet. I is on the list. Reddit is on the list. I think the next two might be Ian and Reddit uh uh in like a couple weeks. So, those I am looking at deeply and we're going to see what we get. I know after Nebius I there's some weird controversy between Nebius and Iran. It's kind of turning. Guess I have to do a deep dive on Iran now because the Nebius bulls hate Iran and Iran bulls hate Nebius. But yeah, we will uh we will see what we get going and then I'll publish that as well.</p>
</details>

首先，对于那些还没看到的人来说，我认为期货市场开盘会相对乐观。我们上涨了0.3%。特朗普已经确认了中美之间有一项协议，所以我们将讨论这项协议的具体情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um futures. First of all, for those that haven't seen it, I think we're going to open up relatively green. We are up 0.3%. Trump has confirmed there is a USChina deal and so we'll talk about what's going on with the US China deal.</p>
</details>

目前期货市场是绿色的。特朗普确认了中美之间应该会有一项协议。我不知道中国方面是否已经确认了有正式的协议，我想这就是我们市场上涨的原因。但一旦隔夜市场开盘，我们会得到更多细节，并进行讨论。我们还有一些关于劳动力市场的新图表，这也很重要。过去几周我们一直在讨论劳动力市场。我们关注的重点是上周的裁员数量，特别是亚马逊裁员3万人。所以我们会讨论这一点及其对劳动力市场的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, futures are green. Trump confirmed there should be a China deal going on. Uh I don't know if China has confirmed that there is an official China deal and that's why I think we are green, but we're going to get some details on that uh once the overnight markets open and we'll talk about that. We have some new charts on the labor market. That's also really important to look at. We've been talking a lot about the labor market over the past couple weeks. The biggest thing that we looked at was the amount of layoffs that we had last week, especially with Amazon with those 30,000 layoffs. So, we're going to talk about that and some implications on the labor market.</p>
</details>

但总的来说，我认为目前隔夜市场上涨的原因是，特朗普和中国之间的关系似乎出现了一些稳定。他们在周四会面，这在周五提振了市场。我们在十月份连续第六个月收涨，当月上涨了2.4%。通常情况下，十一月市场也相对乐观。十月份有些波动，比特币和以太坊在十月份表现不佳。也许十一月情况会有所改变，如果真是这样，那将是利好。现在以太坊有了一些提振，一度冲向4000美元，现在回落到3883美元。比特币也一度突破11万美元，而上周某个时候还在10.4万美元。所以，如果说有哪个月份比特币和以太坊会表现出色，那很可能就是十一月，因为比特币在十一月的表现通常比十月要好一些。但我们将拭目以待，看看月底情况如何。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But overall, I think the reason we're green right now overnight is because it looks like there's some some stability between Trump and China. again they met back on Thursday and that helped the markets on Friday. We did close green for the sixth month in a row in October. So we closed out October up 2.4% for the month. Um and then overall, you know, November is relatively green usually and so we had a bit of a choppy October. Bitcoin and Ethereum kind of sucked in October. Maybe that changes for November and if that does that would be bullish. Now Ethereum is getting a little bit of a boost. It was pushing 4,000. Now it's back to 38.83. Bitcoin as well pushing above 110. It was at 104 at one point last week. So, I mean, I think if there was any month for Bitcoin and Ethereum to do well, it would be November, as Bitcoin actually tends to do a little bit better in November than October. But, we're going to see how these turn out as we get into the end of the month.</p>

### Sam Altman的争议性采访：OpenAI的豪赌与傲慢

好了，大约12分钟后，隔夜市场就要开盘了，之后我们会进入所有我准备好的话题。在此之前，我们先来看看这个视频，因为它已经彻底火了。Sam Altman 和 Satya Nadella 一起上了 Brad Gersonner 的播客，Brad Gersonner 问了一个相对简单的问题，他说：“我一直听说你们有130亿美元的收入，但你们承诺要花费1.4万亿美元。我想我们每个人每天都在质疑，如果 OpenAI 无法兑现这些支出承诺，这会不会是一个会爆炸的泡沫？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so in about 12 minutes, we are going to have the overnight markets open and then we'll get into all the topics I've lined up after the overnight markets open. Before that, let's just take a look at this video because it has absolutely gone viral. Sam Alman was on the Brad Gersonner podcast with Satia Nadella and Brad Gersonner asked a relatively simple question which is hey I keep hearing you have 13 billion in revenue but you've committed to spend 1.4 trillion I think every day all of us question could this be a bubble that explodes if open AAI isn't able to officially spend on these commitments that they've committed to spend on and here is what Mr. Sam Alman had to say to that question.</p>
</details>

>> 你知道，一个年收入130亿美元的公司怎么能做出1.4万亿美元的支出承诺？你也听到了那些批评。
>>
>> 首先，我们的收入远不止那个数。其次，Brad，如果你想卖掉你的股份，我会帮你找个买家。
>>
>> 我只是觉得，你知道，有很多人想买 OpenAI 的股票。我不认为你想要……
>>
>> 包括我自己。包括我自己。
>>
>> 那些对我们的计算能力等问题忧心忡忡的人，或者其他什么人，他们会很乐意购买股份。所以我认为我们可以很快就把你的股份或者其他任何人的股份卖给那些在 Twitter 上对此事大声嚷嚷的人。我们确实计划收入会急剧增长，而且收入正在急剧增长。我们正在做一个未来的赌注，赌它会继续增长，不仅 ChatGPT 会持续增长，我们还能成为重要的人工智能云服务商之一，我们的消费设备业务将成为一项重要且有意义的业务，能够自动化科学的人工智能将创造巨大价值。所以，你知道，我很少想成为一家上市公司，但少数有吸引力的时刻之一就是当那些人写着那些荒谬的“OpenAI 即将倒闭”之类的文章时。我真想告诉他们，他们可以直接做空股票，我乐于看到他们因此被烧得体无完肤。嗯，但是，你知道，我们经过了仔细的规划，我们了解技术和能力将走向何方，以及我们能围绕它构建什么样的产品并产生收入。我们可能会搞砸，这是我们正在下的赌，我们同时也承担着风险。一个确定的风险是，如果我们没有计算能力，我们就无法产生收入，也无法以这种规模制造模型。
>>
>> 没错。
>>
>> 让我说一件事，Brad，作为合作伙伴和投资者，我看到的 OpenAI 提出的商业计划，没有一个他们没有超额完成的。所以在某种程度上，这是唯一一个在增长甚至业务方面，他们的执行力都令人难以置信的地方。坦白说，很明显，每个人都在谈论 OpenAI 在使用率等方面的所有成功，但即使是……我会说，总的来说，业务执行力也相当令人难以置信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> How, you know, how can a company with 13 billion in revenues make 1.4 trillion of spend commitments? You know, and and and you've heard the criticism.
>>
>> First of all, we're doing well more revenue than that. Second of all, Brad, if you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer.
>>
>> I just enough like, you know, people are I I think there's a lot of people who would love to buy OpenAI shares. I don't I don't think you want,
>>
>> including myself. including myself
>>
>> who talk with a lot of like breathless concern about our comput stuff or whatever that would be thrilled to buy shares. So I think we we could sell you know your shares or anybody else's to some of the people who are making the most noise on Twitter whatever about this very quickly. We do plan for revenue to grow steeply. Revenue is growing steeply. We are taking a forward bet that it's going to continue to grow grow and that not only will chache keep growing but we will be able to become one of the important AI clouds that our consumer device business will be a significant and important thing that AI that can automate science will create huge value. So, you know, there are not many times that I want to be a public company, but one of the rare times it's appealing is when those people are writing these ridiculous open AI is about to go out of business and you know, whatever. I would love to tell them they could just short the stock and I would love to see them get burned on that. Um, but
>>
>> you know, I we carefully plan, we understand where the technology, where the capability is going to grow, go and and how the products we can build around that and the revenue we can generate. we might screw it up like this is the bet that we're making and we're taking a risk along with that. A certain risk is if we don't have the compute, we will not be able to generate the revenue or make the models at these at this kind of scale.
>>
>> Exactly. And
>>
>> let me just say one thing uh Brad as both a partner and um an investor there is not been a single business plan that I've seen from OpenAI that they have put in and not beaten it. So in some sense this is the one place where you know in terms of their growth and just even the business it's been unbelievable execution quite frankly I mean obviously openai everyone talks about all the success in the usage and what have you but even um I would say all up uh the business execution has been just pretty unbelievable.</p>
</details>

这个片段在周末之所以如此火爆，并且当我看到时也感到非常惊讶，原因有几点。第一，这是一个合理的问题。博通、甲骨文、AMD、英伟达，根据《华尔街日报》上周的一篇文章，仅仅因为宣布了与英伟达的交易承诺，它们的市值就增加了6300亿美元。我知道 AMD 有庞大的散户军团，但那只股票之所以能达到250美元，完全是因为这个 OpenAI 的交易。就是这样。如果有人有不同意见，请告诉我。但这正是让该股突破的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, so the reason that went so viral over the weekend, we got about nine minutes till the overnight markets open and uh then we'll get into all the other topics. But the reason that went viral and when I saw it, I was quite surprised as well is number one, it's a legit question. Okay, Broadcom, Oracle, AMD, Nvidia, there was an article last week from the Wall Street Journal have gained 630 billion in market cap just from the announcements of the deals that they have uh committed to Nvidia. I mean AMD probably will be stuck at $158 a share for everyone. I know there's a big retail army in AMD. The o the literal only reason that stock is at 250 is because of this opening eye deal. That's it. And if someone else has a different reason, let me know. But that was the reason that got the stock to break out.</p>
</details>

这么说的目的不是为了贬低那笔交易的重要性，而是为了强调这笔交易和 OpenAI 所承诺的支出对于将 AMD 的市值推向4000亿美元，或将甲骨文的市值推向8000亿美元是多么重要。所以，当 Brad Gersonner，顺便说一句，他是过去两年里 OpenAI 最大的投资者之一，早在2023年的私募轮就已入局，他对公司非常了解。当你最大的支持者问你一个非常简单的问题时，他基本上是在给你送分，而不是想给你设陷阱。这家伙持有你大量的股票，他为什么要让你难堪？他是在给你一个机会，让你简单地说清楚。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it is so and the reason is not to downplay the significance of that deal. It's rather to un to underwrite how important the deal is and the spending commitments that are necessary to get AMD to that $400 billion market cap or to get Oracle to that $800 billion market cap which is pledged from OpenAI. So when Brad Gersonner who by the way is one of the bigger investors from the previous two years he was early in 2023 in the private rounds of OpenAI so he knows the company very well. When your biggest supporter is asking you a very simple question he's basically giving you a layup. He's not trying to give you a gotcha question. this guy has a ton of your stock. Why would he be trying to make you look bad? He's trying to give you the opportunity to simply say this</p>
</details>

如果是我，我会说：“看，很多人认为我们的收入是130亿美元。实际上我们远不止于此。”他这么说并不会撒谎，我估计实际收入接近250亿美元。第二，“我们的预测是，到2027年，我们可能会达到三位数，也就是大约1000亿美元的收入。”Sam Altman 后来在播客中也提到了这一点，但他用一种有点自负的方式说的。他本可以就事论事地回答这个问题，比如：“我们预测，虽然不确定能否实现，但我们认为到2027年，我们能达到1000亿美元的收入。”这使得1.4万亿美元的支出承诺（仅为他们预期收入的14倍）听起来不像相对于130亿美元年收入那样疯狂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">is if obviously I'm all I would be like look a lot of people think we're doing 13 billion in revenue. We are doing significantly more than that which he wouldn't be lying about. I think the estimate is closer to 25 billion in revenue. Number two, our estimates are that by 2027 we're probably going to be hitting triple digits. So about 100 billion in revenue, which Sam Alman mentions a little bit later in the podcast, but he does it in kind of like a an egotistic way, right? He makes like he he kind of says it he says it in a way that's bragging when in reality he could have just answered the question be like look we're projecting we don't know if it's going to happen but we think by 2027 we could get to 100 billion revenue which makes the 1.4 4 trillion spend, which is only about 14 times the amount of revenue they're they're bringing in. Not look as crazy as the $1 13 billion annual run rate.</p>
</details>

然后他本可以说：“让别人说去吧。我们有像你 Brad 这样出色的支持者，我们有像 Satya、Jensen 和 Lisa Sue 这样优秀的人支持我们。正因为有这些非常聪明的人支持我们的公司和成长，我们非常有信心能够兑现我们公开承诺的支出。” 就这样，他只需要这么说。这对他来说本是一个绝佳的机会，去称赞所有信任他公司会成功的人。他可以回馈一句赞美，说因为他们如此相信我们，我们非常兴奋能继续这段旅程。那样事情就结束了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then he could have said, you know, let people say whatever they want to say. We have amazing people like you, Brad, that support us. We have amazing people like Satia and Jensen and Lisa Sue that support us. And because we have all these really smart people supporting our company and our growth, we are very confident that we're going to be able to commit to the spending that we have said that we're going to commit to publicly. That's it. That's all you have to say. That's literally all he It was such a layup for him to give a compliment to all the people that are trusting that his company's going to succeed. He could give them a compliment back and say because they believe in us so much, you know, we're so excited to continue working on this journey. And that would have been the end of it.</p>
</details>

相反，他变成了一个自恋狂，说什么“哦，我真希望我们是上市公司，这样我就可以告诉人们去做空股票了。”他试图模仿 Karp 的风格，但问题是，Karp 之所以是 Karp 是有原因的。很少有人能模仿 Karp 的做法而仍然显得有魅力。大多数尝试这样做的人不会有魅力，只会显得像个混蛋。而他最终就是这样。所以我认为这是一个奇怪的回应，反应过度了。你可以看出 Gersonner 都被他弄得措手不及。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Instead, he turns into this like narcissistic, oh, I wish we were a public company so I could tell people to short the stock. He tried to pull a Karp moment and it's like there's a reason Karp is Karp. Very few people can emulate what Karp does and still be relatively charismatic. Most people that try to do that are not going to be charismatic. They're going to just seem like dicks. And uh you know that's that's what he ended up doing. So I thought it was a a weird response. I think it was overly defensive. You could tell Gersonner was taken back for it and</p>
</details>

Gersonner 后来在 Twitter 上公开评论，试图为他辩护，说：“我觉得 Sam 因为这个受到了太多抨击。”他还说：“我们对此一笑而过。” 我想，好吧，但在这样一个每家 AI 公司都依赖 OpenAI 的时代，这就成了一个两难的境地。即使你讨厌 Sam Altman，即使那个片段让你非常生气，即使你觉得这家伙油滑，不想和他有任何瓜葛，但如果你投资了这个市场，你就必须相信 OpenAI 会赢。就这么简单。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Gersner you know publicly commented on Twitter. He was like I think Sam is getting too much flack for that. I mean look in the grand scheme of things is this going to matter? No. But like at the end of the day, if Sam is acting like that to one of his biggest supporters, aka Brad Gersonner, I wonder how he acts to other people, you know? I really do. And and it's one of those things where it really makes you think in terms of how this is playing out. So again, Gersonner tried to defend him right here, saying that people are reading it to say I'm being too feisty. We laughed about it. I'm like, sure, but in in an age where every single AI company is depending on this company, OpenAI, which is the catch 22. It's like even if you hate Sam Alman, even if that clip pissed you off so much, even if you think this guy is squirmy and you just want nothing to do with him, if you are invested in this market, you have to believe OpenAI is going to win. It is just that simple.</p>
</details>

我很想听听任何人的分析，告诉我 OpenAI 可以输，而 AI 牛市还能继续。因为我看过数据，我正在写一篇关于这个的 Substack 文章，下周会发布，结论是没有办法。OpenAI 基本上是“大到不能倒”。就这么简单。他们已经大到不能倒了。你可能会说，“哦，那 XAI 和 Gemini 呢？”当然。但 AMD 市值达到4000亿美元是因为 OpenAI。Oracle 冲向7000-8000亿美元也是因为 OpenAI。Nvidia 市值增加到现在的水平，在某种程度上也是因为 OpenAI。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I would love any analysis from someone telling me that OpenAI can lose and the AI bull market can continue because I've looked at the numbers. I'm working on a Substack piece about this coming out next week and it it there is no way OpenAI essentially they're too big to fail. It's just that simple. They're too big to fail given this. And you can say, "Oh, well, what about XAI Gemini?" Sure. But the reason AMD is at a $400 billion market cap is because of OpenAI. The reason Oracle is pushing 700 800 billion is because of OpenAI. The reason Nvidia to an extent has added the level of market cap that's added is because of OpenAI.</p>
</details>

所以，归根结底，除非像 Gemini 或 XAI 这样的公司能大规模超越 ChatGPT 每周8亿的活跃用户，否则感觉 OpenAI 已经太大了。因此，他们必须赢。所以如果你投资了 AI 生态系统，你就得为他们的成功加油。但运营这家公司的人，在回答那个问题的方式上，显然不是最有魅力的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, at the end of the day, it's like unless a company like Gemini or or uh XAI massively overtake the 800 million weekly activives that CHABT has, feels like opening eye is too big. And as a result, they kind of have to win. So you kind of have to root for their success if you're invested in the AI ecosystem. But the guy who's running it is obviously not the most charismatic in terms of how we answer that question.</p>
</details>

不过，有一点你必须佩服 OpenAI，那就是如果你投资了 IREN 或 Nebius，或者所有这些数据中心公司，它们都需要有人签订大量的 GPU 支出合同，需要大量的计算能力。而最终，OpenAI 就是承诺了1.4万亿美元的公司之一。我还没听说有几家公司承诺在未来10年投入1.4万亿美元，老实说，这个数字可能还算便宜了。所以，这就是 AI 整体格局的演变方式之一。但显然，那次采访之所以疯传，是因为 Sam 的言论听起来有点像个混蛋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Alman said we want to 100x those GPUs. And the one thing you have to commend OpenAI for is that look, if you're invested in IEN or Nebus or like all the all these data center plays need someone to contract massive amounts of GPU spend, massive amounts of compute capacity. And at the end of the day, uh, OpenAI is one of those companies that is again committed 1.4 trillion. Like I haven't heard a lot of other companies commit 1.4 trillion in the next 10 years, which honestly might be cheap. So, it's just one of those ways that the the overall structure of AI seems to be playing out. But obviously, that interview went viral because, you know, Sam kind of sounded like a dick.</p>
</details>

不过他在采访后期确实说了一件事，我们稍后会听听其他部分，那就是我们有望在2027年前实现1000亿美元的收入，这是一个大新闻。我认为这改变了很多人的预期。如果他们对这1000亿美元的预测是保守的，实际上可能会达到2000亿左右，那 OpenAI 5000亿美元的估值可能就显得被低估了。到那时，它的市销率只有5倍，这很便宜。如果是这样，那么未来几年 OpenAI 可能会获得更多动力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The one thing he did say though later in the interview and we'll listen to some other parts of it in a bit is uh that we are on track to get 100 billion of revenue by 2027 which is a big deal. Uh I think that changed a lot of estimates. If they're underounting that 100 billion and it's actually going to be like 200 billion something like that. It really makes OpenAI at 500 billion probably look undervalued. At that point it's trading at 5x sales which is cheap. And you know, if that's the case, then you're likely going to get some more momentum out of OpenAI over the coming years.</p>

### 隔夜市场开盘与初步反应

好了，距离市场开盘还有3分钟。感谢大家的到来。在隔夜市场开盘后，我们有很多话题要谈。我认为市场会有一些大的上下波动，但标普期货上涨了0.3%，所以没什么太疯狂的预期。比特币和以太坊试图有所动作，但幅度不大。我们将在接下来的两分钟内看到市场如何开盘。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, that's what we got. All right, 3 minutes until the market opens. Thank you everybody for being here. We got a lot to talk about after these overnight markets. I think we're going to get some big moves up and down, but S&P's up.3% in the future, so there's nothing too crazy to expect. Uh, Bitcoin Ethereum tried to make a little bit of a move, but you know, they're not making too much move. So, we're going to see in the next two minutes how this market opens.</p>
</details>

特朗普刚刚结束了他的 CBS 采访，所以我会给你们一些采访中的引述。我不能播放任何片段，因为 CBS 在版权方面非常严格，但我会给你们一些关于特朗普最新言论的数据，他谈了很多关于中国的话题，所以市场可能正在消化更多地缘政治稳定而非不稳定的因素。关于中国，老实说，十一月最重要的事情甚至不是隔夜市场即将开盘，不是巴菲特的现金储备，也不是 OpenAI 或英伟达。真正重要的是，我们迎来了十一月的全新开端。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Trump just finished his CBS interview, so I'll get you some quotes from the interview. I can't play any clips because CBS is like really strong on the copyright, but I'll get you some data on uh the new quotes that we have from Trump, he talked a lot about China, and so the markets could be pricing in a little bit of more of geopolitical stability versus instability. In regards to China as well, honestly, the most important thing about November, it's not even really that the overnight markets are about to open. It's not Buffett's cash pile. It's not uh it's not OpenAI. It's not Nvidia. It's it's really not anything other than the fact that we have a new candle for November, folks.</p>
</details>

好了，5秒倒计时。让我们看看十一月的隔夜市场将如何开盘。顺便说一下，如果对很多人来说我迟到了，很抱歉。美国实行了夏令时，我知道这会打乱世界上很多国际地区朋友的时间。所以从现在开始，我们每周日都会在这个时间开始。标普上涨0.7%，报684点。我们看到了一个上涨的标普。SoFi 也上涨了约0.74%。AMD 上涨1.12%。Robinhood 报148美元，周五上涨了6%，表现不错。Palantir 报203美元，上涨1.2%。我们会做一个简短的 Palantir 预览。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, 5 seconds. Let's see what we got. Overnight markets for November are officially open. Here we go. By the way, sorry if I'm late for a lot of people. We had daylight savings in the United States. I know that kind of messes up the time for a bunch of people in the uh the international parts of the world, but yeah. So now we will officially be starting every Sunday at this time for you guys. S&P that's up 7% 684. We got a green S&P. SoFi is up about 74% as well. AMD that's up 1.12%. Hoodie 148 that did have a 6% move on uh on Friday which was very nice to see. Palunteer 203 that's up 1.2%.</p>
</details>

英伟达上涨0.7%。我很高兴英伟达上涨了近1%，因为特朗普在CBS的采访中说，他和Jensen谈过，他们一致认为Blackwell芯片不应该卖给我们最大的竞争对手。我不知道Jensen是否同意这一点，但这对于Blackwell芯片意味着什么，我也不确定。我绝对不认为我们短期内能从中国获得收入。Jensen还有另一个采访，我们稍后会看。但特朗普确实暗示，Blackwell可能短期内不会进入中国。所以，英伟达股价实际上涨而不是跌，我认为这是个好现象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nvidia, that's up n7%. Now, I I'm I'm happy that Nvidia is up almost 1% because Trump did say in that CBS interview that um I talked to Jensen and essentially he said that we agreed that Blackwell should not be going well, he agreed. I don't know if Jensen agreed that Blackwell should not be going to our biggest competitors. I don't know what that necessarily means for Blackwell chips and I definitely don't think we're getting China revenue anytime soon. Jensen did have another interview that will look at it. well in a little bit. But, uh, Trump did kind of signal that, you know, maybe Blackwell is not going to be going to China anytime soon. So, the fact that Nvidia is actually up and not going down on that, I think is nice to see.</p>

### 英伟达的中国策略：Jensen Huang的解读

好的，我们开始吧。我想我们先从 Jensen 的采访开始，因为这可能为我们接下来要讨论的很多事情定下基调。这是 Jensen 今天早上在福克斯新闻上的采访，这是他关于中国、特朗普以及当前局势的所有表态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, cool. So, let's get into it. I think we'll start off with uh this Jensen interview because this probably frames a lot of stuff that we got to talk about. So this was Jensen. He was on Fox this morning and this is everything that he had to say about China, Trump, what's going on.</p>
</details>

>> 告诉我关于在亚利桑那州制造这款 Blackwell 芯片的情况，Jensen。将如此重要的芯片生产带回美国有多困难？
>>
>> 嗯，首先，人工智能是一场工业革命，这是我们时代最重要的技术，甚至可能是所有时代中最重要的技术。当特朗普总统刚上任时，他希望我们在本土制造这些关键技术。他想让美国再工业化。他希望能源增长。他希望确保美国在人工智能领域处于领先地位。为了做到这一点，我们需要在能源领域领先，在芯片领域领先，在建设人工智能基础设施和工厂方面领先，当然也包括在构建人工智能模型方面领先，还要在医疗、制造、机器人、科学和工业等各个行业的不同应用中使用人工智能。他希望在他的政府中实现这一点，并希望以光速实现。所以我告诉他，通过与台积电的合作，我们将在9个月内将制造业带回美国。台积电是美国一个了不起的合作伙伴，还有富士康、纬创、安靠和日月光。我们现在已经能够在美国完全制造出世界上最先进的人工智能芯片。在亚利桑那州，工人们非常努力，机械工程师、电工、水管工、建筑工人，他们都夜以继日地工作。九个月后，我们现在已经量产了世界上最先进的人工智能芯片。
>>
>> 在美国制造比在台湾制造要贵得多吗？
>>
>> 是的，在美国制造更贵，但我们会随着时间的推移做得更好。你知道，将制造业迁回本土，并且是同类工厂中的第一家，成本会高一些，但这没关系。国家安全的好处、供应链弹性的好处、在美国创造就业的好处……我们将制造芯片、系统，而这些系统，这些人工智能超级计算机，将进入未来的人工智能工厂，被美国的每一个行业使用。所以，随着时间的推移，我猜这将创造数百万个就业机会，而且是非常高质量的就业机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Tell me about manufacturing this Blackwell chip in Arizona Jensen. How difficult was that to achieve to bring such an important chip production here to America?
>>
>> Well, first of all, AI is a industrial revolution and this is the most important technology of our time, potentially the most important technology of all time. And when President Trump first took office, uh he wanted us to manufacture these critical technologies on shore. He wanted to re-industrialize the United States. He wants to have energy growth. He wants to make sure that United States is a leader in artificial intelligence. And in order to do in order to do so, we need to lead in energy. We need to lead in chips. We need to lead in building AI infrastructures and factories including lead in building AI models of course, but also using AI in all the different applications in various industries from healthcare to manufacturing to robotics to you know science and and industry. So uh he wanted he wanted that uh in his administration and he wanted it at the speed of light and so I told him that we would bring manufacturing back within 9 months with the partnership of TSMC which is an incredible partner for the United States Foxcon Wistron Amcor and Spill we've been able to manufacture now the most advanced AI chip in the world completely in the United States and Arizona the the the the the workers worked incredibly hard the mechanical engineers, the mechanical, the electricians, the plumbers, the construction workers, they all worked around the clock. Nine months later, we're now in volume production of the most advanced AI chip in the world. I
>>
>> Is it much more expensive to do it in the United States versus Taiwan?
>>
>> It is. It is more more expensive to do in the United States, but we're going to get better over time. you know, reman reonshoring manufacturing and the first uh plant of its kind. It's going to cost a little bit more money, but that's okay. the the uh the national security benefits uh the supply chain resilience benefits the job creation benefits here in the United States you know we're going to manufactured chips systems and those systems are going these these AI supercomputers are going to go into what are going to be AI factories which are going to be used by every single industry in the United States and so this is going to create over time you know my guess is millions of jobs, millions of jobs and really really high quality jobs, you know, from high really skilled trade craft. And</p>
</details>

显然，Jensen 对美国的制造业和再工业化感到非常兴奋，而这正是特朗普想听到的。当被具体问及这对英伟达的中国业务意味着什么时，他是这样回答的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> so you got Jensen obviously very excited about the American manufacturing and re-industrialization part and that is what Trump wants to hear. Here's what he had to say specifically when he was asked about what this means for the China part of Nvidia's business.</p>
</details>

>> 我们将暂停实施相关的出口管制。这份协议对你和英伟达向中国销售产品意味着什么？
>>
>> 这真是一项了不起的成就。这是一次里程碑式的会晤，一项里程碑式的协议，一项历史性的协议。我读到的所有新闻报道都显示，两位总统之间以及两国之间建立的尊重和友好的关系。因此，这确实创造了条件，我希望英伟达能够重返中国市场进行竞争。在特朗普总统的第一届政府期间，他为美国在技术领域领先定下了完美的基调，确保美国公司拥有最好和最先的技术，但同时也让美国科技公司走向世界，去竞争并获胜。在过去的四年里，本届政府让我们走上了一条适得其反的道路。这些政策确实事与愿违。当特朗普总统离任时，我们在中国这个世界上最重要的市场之一拥有95%的市场份额，而现在英伟达在中国的市场份额是0%。所以现在是时候了，这是一个绝佳的机会，让我们重置，回到特朗普第45届政府的政策，让美国的人工智能公司能够走向世界，去中国竞争，在市场上竞争，并能够在全球范围内传播和推广美国的技术标准，这样我们就可以设定全球标准，让世界建立在美国标准之上，从而引领世界。所以我认为这为我们创造了条件。我希望我们能够回到特朗普第45届政府的政策，重返市场并参与竞争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> We'll suspend the implementation of relevant export controls. What does this agreement mean for you and Nvidia with regard to selling to China?
>>
>> Well, what an achievement. This is a milestone meeting, a milestone deal, a historic deal. And the readouts uh from from all the news that I've read uh just the respectful uh the friendly relationship that they've built uh between the two presidents and of course between the two countries. Therefore, uh the the post from Secretary Heg Heath and uh and all the readouts from uh Secretary Bessant have have all been extraordinary. You know, this really creates the conditions I hope uh for Nvidia to be able to go back and compete in market in China. Trump 45 in the in President Trump's first administration. Uh he set the tone perfectly for America to lead in technology and make sure that America American companies have the best and first but for American technology companies to go around the world to compete and win. In the last four years, the administration really set us on a path that really backfired. the policies have really backfired from a 95% market share in in the China market which is one of the most important markets in the world when President Trump left office and video's market share in China is now 0%. And so this is really time and it's a great great opportunity for us to reset back to the Trump 45 policies for the Trump 45 policies where AI American AI companies are able to go around go to China compete for compete in the marketplace and be able to diffuse and and proliferate American technology standards around the world so that we could set global standards so that uh the world is built on American standards so that we could lead the world. And so I I think uh creates the conditions for us to do that. I hope we're able to to um revert back to the policies of the Trump 45 administration and and um get back get back into the market and compete.</p>
</details>

这是 Jensen 的评论。很多人将其解读为中国市场即将回归。显然，他并没有说中国市场会回归，他说的是希望特朗普和习的协议能为英伟达带来中国收入，或者说希望英伟达能重获中国市场份额，因为现在他们的市场份额是零。然后，20分钟前，你听到了特朗普的这段话，这就是为什么我对英伟达在隔夜市场上涨感到惊讶。但这就是他关于 Blackwell 芯片的原话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So that was the comment by Jensen. A lot of people interpreted that as China's coming back. Obviously he did not say China's coming back. He's saying hopefully the uh implications of the Trump and Xi deal will lead to China revenue or will will lead to China market share hopefully coming back for Nvidia because right now their market share is zero. And then 20 minutes ago you had this from Trump which is why I was surprised Nvidia is actually up in the overnight markets. But this is exactly what he said about Blackwell.</p>
</details>

>> 我们不把那个芯片给别人。
>>
>> 那最后一句，“我们不把那个芯片给别人。”看，也许特朗普只是这么说，因为他想在与中国的谈判中获得更多筹码。但正如你所见，他明确表示，“我们不把那个芯片给别人”，这意味着如果特朗普对英伟达保持类似立场，Blackwell 芯片的收入可能不会回来。所以，即使特朗普对英伟达大加赞赏，即使 Jensen 把 GTC 大会带到华盛顿，即使 Jensen 明显称赞特朗普政府并表示他相信整个美国再工业化，但如果特朗普不准备把 Blackwell 芯片给中国，我想中国是想要这款芯片的。中国在夏天就已经表示，他们不想要任何低于 Blackwell 的东西，因为如果你给他们低于 Blackwell 的产品，他们还不如自己造芯片，这就造成了 Jensen 一直在谈论的整个问题——美国技术无法成为全球 AI 技术的基础。
>>
>> 问题的关键在于 Blackwell。当英伟达正式推出 Vera Rubin 芯片，然后我们给他们 Blackwell，我敢肯定中国人不会高兴。所以，我们还没有关于英伟达情况的全部细节，但至少到目前为止，市场似乎忽略了这一点，这得益于 Jensen 上周谈到的5000亿美元的机会，以及未来五个季度不包括任何来自中国的指引。我认为市场忽略了这一点，这是好事而不是坏事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> We don't give that ship to other people.
>>
>> That last sentence, we don't give that chip to other people. So, look, maybe Trump is just saying that because he wants to get a little bit more of a negotiation on what we get with China. Uh, but as you can see, he clearly said, "We don't give that chip to other people." which means the blackwell chip is likely not coming back in terms of revenue if this is the similar stance that Trump is going to have on Nvidia. So even with the praise of Nvidia, even with Jensen bringing GTC to DC, even with Jensen obviously praising the Trump administration and saying that he believes in this whole American re-industrialization, if Trump is not ready to give the Blackwell chip to China, I would imagine China wants the chip and China has already said back in the summer they don't want anything less than Blackwell because if you give them something less than Blackwell, then they might as well just build their own chip, which creates the entire problem that Jensen's been talking about for American technology not being the foundation for overall AI technology around the world.
>>
>> it comes down to Blackwell and you know when we create Vera Rubin when that officially goes live with Nvidia and then we give them Blackwell I'm sure the Chinese are not going to be happy about that. So I mean we don't fully have any details on what's going on with Nvidia but at least the market so far because of the $500 billion opportunity that Jensen talked about last week and uh excluding any of the guidance from China over the next five quarters. I think the market's overlooking that which is like a good thing to see rather than a bad thing to see.</p>
</details>

### 中美贸易关系的最新进展

那么，贸易关系到底发生了什么？这是昨晚发布在美国政府官网上的内容，具体如下：中方将暂停新的**稀土**（Rare earth: 一组具有特殊光电磁性质的金属元素的总称，对高科技产业至关重要）出口管制，将为稀土出口颁发通用许可证，将采取重大措施阻止芬太尼流入美国，将暂停自3月4日以来的所有报复性关税，暂停自3月4日以来的所有报复性非关税措施，并购买至少1200万公吨的美国大豆。美方将把关税降低10%，从57%降至47%，并将**301条款**（Section 301: 美国《1974年贸易法》中的一个条款，授权美国总统对被认定为“不公平”或“歧视性”的外国贸易行为采取报复措施）关税豁免的到期日延长至2026年11月。这是白宫昨天发布的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now what actually happened with the trade relations? So this came out last night. This was published on the US.gov website and this is exactly what they said. The Chinese are going to suspend new rare earth export controls. They're going to issue general licenses for exports of rare earths. They're going to take significant measures to end the flow of fentinel to the US. They're going to suspend all retaliatory tariffs since March 4th. suspend all retaliatory non-tariff measures since March 4th and purchase at least 12 million metric tonses of US soybeans. The US is going to lower tariffs by 10% from uh 57 to 47, extend the expiration of section 301 tariff exclusions until November 2026 published by the White House yesterday.</p>
</details>

其中没有任何内容表明中国将正式获得 Blackwell 芯片，但我认为这让市场松了一口气，因为现在似乎不会在年底爆发大规模的贸易战。显然，中方还需要确认这一点，但我认为他们已经购买了一些大豆以示诚意。考虑到上周我们报道的谈判情况，似乎一切都相对顺利，而那种让全球都感到恐慌的稀土出口管制可能不会发生，因此，这可能是件好事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So nothing in that says that China will officially get Blackwell, but I think it's giving the market a lot of ease now that there's not this massive trade war that might break out towards the end of the year. Obviously, the Chinese have to confirm this, but I think they already bought some soybeans as a sign of good faith. And, you know, given the negotiations that happened last week that we covered, it seems like everything is relatively okay and the export controls on rare earths that kind of really got everyone scared globally might not be happening and as a result, you know, that might be the good thing.</p>
</details>

现在，很多人在问：“中国从这个协议中得到了什么？”这是一个好问题，因为除了关税降低，我真的不知道中国还得到了什么。他们获得了进入美国消费市场的机会，这非常重要，他们的经济需要这个，因为过去几年他们一直处于衰退中。但这确实令人困惑，过去几个月一直如此。比如六月份，特朗普说我们达成了中国协议，但显然没有。那个协议的核心是允许中国学生去哈佛，这在当时毫无道理。这怎么能成为协议的基础？所以，我认为我们在中美问题上还没有完全走出困境。市场对此确实冷静了一些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, a lot of people are saying, "What does China get from that deal?" I mean, it's a good point because outside of the tariff reduction, I don't really know what China is getting from that deal. I mean, they get access to the US consumer, which is very important, and their economy needs that because they've been in a recession over the past couple years. Uh, but yeah, it is confusing, right? And it's been confusing for the past couple of months. Like back in June, Trump said we had a China deal. We obviously didn't. And that China deal was centered around like allowing Chinese students to be able to effectively go to Harvard, which made no sense at times. Like, how is that the basis for a a deal? So, I don't think we're out of the woods yet on this USChina situation. The markets are definitely a bit more calm about it.</p>
</details>

### 美国经济的双重景象：消费疲软与财富效应

现在，让我们看看这些非常重要的消费类股票的年初至今回报。Chipotle，我们上周都看到了他们的财报发生了什么。CEO 亲口说，年收入低于10万美元、年龄在25到34岁之间的人进店次数减少了。Wendy's 今年下跌了44%，我甚至都不知道。Lululemon 简直是一场灾难，下跌了54%。Whirlpool 下跌了35%，尽管他们的财报不错。Macy's 下跌了27%。Caesars 下跌了38%。Under Armour 下跌了36%。当你看到这些消费类股票时，情况有点难看。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, so take a look at this right here. These are the year-to-ate returns on some very important consumer stocks. Chipotle, we all saw last week what happened with their earnings. The CEO literally said people making less than 100,000 from ages 25 to 34 are not entering the store as much. Wendy's was down 44% this year. I didn't even know that was the case. Lululemon, that's been a train wreck, down 54%. Whirlpool down 35%, although they did have good earnings. Macy's down 27%. Caesars down 38%. Under Arour down 36. I mean, it's a little ugly when you look at these consumer stocks.</p>
</details>

这里有另一张图表显示了更多信息。金宝汤公司、通用磨坊、卡夫亨氏、高露洁、宝洁。这些是今年以来表现最差的股票。这里有两个微妙的观点。第一，这些公司是世界上最好的公司吗？可能不是。我想英伟达、微软、亚马逊、谷歌等公司的执行力要比宝洁和 Lululemon 好得多。这是第一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's another chart that shows even more. the Camples company, General Mills, Craft Hind, Colgate, uh, Proctor and Gamble. These have been the worst performing stocks of the entire year. So, there's two kind of nuanced points around this. Number one is has has have these companies been the best companies in the world. Probably not. I would imagine Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, etc. are executing a lot better than Proctor and Gamble and and Lululemon. So, that that's the first point.</p>
</details>

但第二点，我认为人们开始思考消费者到底怎么了，是因为这些都是面向消费者的公司，而且不仅仅是 Chipotle。还有很多其他快餐品牌。比如 Shake Shack，它并不完全是针对低端消费者的，但它的股价今年一整年都受到了冲击。Shake Shack 在中产阶级消费者中通常表现不错，但现在也不太好。所以问题是，经济到底发生了什么？我们已经讨论这个问题很长时间了。正如 Gerald 在这里所说，人们确实在受苦。我认为即使我们是资产持有者，也不能忽视经济中确实有人在受苦这个事实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But second of all, the reason I think people are starting to wonder what's going on with the consumer is because these are consumer oriented companies and it's not just Chipotle. There's a lot of other fast food brands. I mean, Shake Shack, which is, you know, not really for the low end of the consumer, but uh their stock has been hit all year. And, you know, Shakes Shack tends to do relatively well uh even with middle class consumers, that's not been doing that great. So, the question is what's going on in the economy? And we've been talking about this for a long time. As Gerald says right here, people are definitely hurting. And I don't think even if we are asset holders, we can ignore the fact that obviously people are hurting in this economy.</p>
</details>

这就是为什么有人问了这个问题。等一下，如果我们不降息，而你看到 Chipotle 今年下跌了45%，一周内下跌20%，那么对于那些可能需要通过再融资来减轻个人贷款或汽车贷款还款压力的低端消费者来说，到底发生了什么？汽车贷款违约率，尤其是次级贷款，一直不太好。显然，美联储能采取的措施就是降息。所以我认为，这一点，再加上劳动力市场的情况，并不是说经济处于可怕的境地，而是说我们作为投资者不能忽视经济中有些部分在2026年表现不佳。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Which is why Bent was asked this question. Wait a second. If we don't cut rates and you're seeing Chipotle take a 45% draw down this year, 20% in a week, like what's going on for the low end of the consumer that likely needs to get a little bit of relief on their personal loan payment to refinance it or their auto loan payment? Auto loan delinquencies have, you know, not been the best, especially subprime. um in regards to how they're going to navigate their expenses. And obviously the answer is that at least what the Fed's disposal is going to have is lowering rates. So I think this along with what's going on with the labor market is is is not to say that the economy is in a horrible situation. It's just to say we as investors cannot ignore that there are factions of the economy that are not doing well in 2026.</p>
</details>

这种情况必须有所转变，要么是这些公司内部的转变，如果这真的只是公司的问题。但当你看到像这样的图表时，这些都是消费品牌。而且很多这些消费品牌不是路易威登，它们不是试图以1万美元的价格卖一件衬衫的公司。这些是销售相对便宜产品的公司，但它们的股价却一直表现不佳。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's going to have to be some level of turnaround either internally with these companies if it really is just a company thing. But when you look at a chart like this, these are all consumer brands. And a lot of these consumer brands are not Louis Vuitton, you know, these are these are not brands that are trying to sell a shirt for $10,000. These are companies that are selling relatively cheap products that have not been able to get their stock to do well.</p>
</details>

这引出了关于**财富效应**（Wealth Effect: 指的是当人们持有的资产（如股票、房产）价值上升时，他们会感觉更富有，从而增加消费支出的经济现象）的讨论。这是本周末《The Compound and Friends》节目中一个两到三分钟的片段，讨论了财富效应这个概念，因为这似乎是经济能够支撑住的原因。

>> 我想深入探讨一下，因为这是我每周都愿意为之辩护的观点。我是财富效应的忠实信徒。我认为这是经济中最重要的因素，没有之一。它决定了就业，决定了人们是否能获得加薪。我认为它还决定了资本支出项目。没有什么比股价下跌30%更能迅速阻止人工智能领域的资本支出了。所以，我认为我们严重低估了股市影响实体经济的能力。比以往任何时候都多的美国人拥有401k养老金计划。我理解住房对中产阶级来说是更大的资产，等等。我都明白。但那些为别人工作的人，他们关心的是自己所在公司的股票期权。我就是认为这是一个巨大的驱动力。
>>
>> 是的，故事是什么？故事就是财富效应驱使人们去经销商那里买一辆新的 F-150。而不是贸易战的胡说八道。这些公司处理这场关税战、处理这种关税情况处理得非常好，不是因为他们能控制所购物资的价格，而是因为需求从未减弱。
>>
>> 我认为这是一个非常重要的观点。福特和通用汽车的表现，至少通用汽车今年的表现超过了特斯拉。福特的股价基本上处于两年来的高点。为什么？因为他们能卖出更多的车。为什么能卖出更多的车？因为人们有更多的钱，不仅仅是因为他们的薪水，还因为他们持有资产。即使只是他们的401k，他们也感觉更富有了。这就是财富效应的整个概念。他们能够买更多的车，而且这些车相对比特斯拉便宜。所以，从这个角度看，你问自己，通用汽车怎么可能在一天内上涨20%，就像两周前那样？可能就是因为这个财富效应。需求从未减弱，因为每个人的股票投资组合都处于历史高位。

<p class="english-text">>> I want to double click on that because like this is the hill that I like to die on every week. I'm a wealth effect truther. I think it's the number one most important factor in the economy, bar none. It decides employment. It decides whether or not people get wage increases. I think it decides capex spending projects. Nothing will halt AI capex in its tracks faster than a stock price that falls 30%. Nothing. And so, as a result, I really think we underpric the ability of the stock market to influence things that happen in the real economy. Um, more Americans than ever are in 401ks. I understand housing is a bigger asset for the middle class, blah blah blah. I get all that. The people that work for people though, those people, they care about their stock options in the companies they work for. I just I think it's a huge driver.
>>
>> Yeah. What's the story there? The story there is the wealth effect is what sends people to the dealership to buy a new F-150. Not trade war [ __ ] These companies have handled this tariff war handled this this tariff situation so well, not because they're in control of the prices of of the supplies they buy, but because the demand never let up.
>>
>> I I and I I think this is a really important point. Ford and GM have out or GM has at least outperformed Tesla this year. Ford's basically trading at a two-year high. Why? They're able to sell more cars. Why are they able to sell more cars? Because people have more money, not just because of their paychecks, but because they're holding on to assets. Even if it's just their 401k, they feel richer. That's the whole concept of the wealth effect. And they're able to buy more cars and those cars are relatively cheaper than a Tesla. So, I mean, from that perspective, you ask yourself, how is GM going up 20% in a day like it did two weeks ago? It might be because of this wealth effect. The demand never let up because everyone's stock portfolio is at a record high.</p>

### 劳动力市场的警示信号

这里有另一张图表，一直在周末疯传，我认为非常值得一看。它又回到了关于劳动力市场现状的争论。请看这里，黑色线是标普500指数，蓝色线是总职位空缺数。中间是 ChatGPT 于2022年11月正式发布的时间点。如你所见，标普500指数在走高，对于我们这些持有资产的人来说，我们变得更富有了。而就业市场却在恶化，尽管失业率仍低于5%，这在历史上不算糟糕。但总职位空缺数在下降。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, there's another chart that's been going quite viral over the weekend that I think is uh pretty important to look at. And, you know, it goes back to this argument about what's going on with the with the labor market. So, take a look at this. Uh S&P 500 in in the black and then chatbt or sorry, total job openings in the blue. Uh CHBT is in the middle right there. November 2022 when it officially launched. As you can see, the S&P 500 is going higher, and for all of us that own assets, we are getting richer. The job market is getting worse, even though employment is still below 5%, which is historically not bad. Uh, but as you can see, total job openings are going down.</p>
</details>

因此，人们开始思考一个问题：这个该死的人工智能会不会让股东变得富有，却让其他人变得贫穷，因为没人有工作了，而这最终也会在某个时候伤害到股东。我不知道答案，但根据这样的图表，这似乎正在明显地发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And as a result, it's one of those things where people are starting to wonder, wait a second, is this damn AI thing going to make shareholders rich, but going to leave everybody else poor because no one's going to have a job, which eventually will hurt shareholders at some point. And I don't know, but based on a chart like this, it seems rather obvious that this is playing out.</p>
</details>

这里还有另一件事值得一看。这是来自《华尔街日报》的数据，显示了亚马逊公司的员工数量。如你所见，与微软一样，亚马逊的员工数量在下降。在最近一轮裁员后，亚马逊的员工数比2021年有所减少，而且可能还会有更多裁员。微软的员工数也比峰值下降了6%。大型科技公司曾经雇佣的员工总数似乎已经达到了顶峰。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's another thing right here to take a look at. So, Amazon.com employees, this is from the Wall Street Journal. As you can take a look right there, along with Microsoft is down. Amazon is down from 2021 after the recent round of layoffs, which likely some more layoffs are coming. And then Microsoft is down 6% from the peak. It seems like the total amount of jobs that the big tech companies have used to employ has reached the peak</p>
</details>

我认为，大型科技公司未来拥有的员工数量极不可能超过2021年的水平。原因有二。第一，他们在疫情期间过度招聘。第二，他们根本不需要那么多人。在人工智能时代，我很难想象我们还会像历史上那样有那么多的职位空缺。这将是我们所有人都要经历的一个有趣的实验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I think it is very unlikely like I'm just you know just looking at these charts and then anecdotally looking at what's going on in the world of AI it seems very unlikely that the big tech companies are ever going to have more employees than they had back in 2021. Uh for two reasons. Number one they overhired during the pandemic. So that was one thing that contributed to that many new employees. Number two is like they just don't need that many people. They just don't need that many people. And and you know, a after these day in the life videos went viral from some of these product managers that sip their my ties at the pool of the company office and respond to two Slack messages. And I don't mean to undermine a product manager's job, but that's what some of these videos that went viral were about. And you know, you probably have Zuckerbergs looking at these videos and being like, "Huh?" First of all, they're posted on TikTok, not even Instagram. So Zuck's like, "All right, so you're posting on our competitor." Number two, Zucks is like, "Well, do we really need that person? Do we really need that?" You know, and so I don't know in the age of AI, it seems very difficult for me to imagine that we are actually going to have the amount of jobs that we've had open historically and it's going to be an interesting experiment for all of us to kind of play out.</p>

### 财报前瞻：Palantir 与 Grab

好了，Palantir，我们来谈谈它。首先，谁感到兴奋？我们稍后会谈 Grab，但 Palantir 的财报就在明天。我想这正式是我在频道上公开报道的第18个季度了，感觉有点疯狂。但我确实很兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, Palinger, let's talk about it. Let's talk about it. First of all, who's excited? Who's excited? We'll talk about Grab after, but Palanteer is tomorrow. I think this is officially the 18th quarter I'll be covering publicly on the channel. It's kind of crazy, dude. Um, but I am pretty excited for it.</p>
</details>

我之所以兴奋，是因为我周末看了数据。Seeking Alpha 上有盈利预测，华尔街的预测是10.9亿美元。Palantir 基本上给出的指引就是10.9亿美元。所以分析师们并没有真正提高公司的预期，他们基本上是在赌公司会符合指引。他们在过去大约10个季度里都是这么做的。而 Palantir 做了什么？他们以一种让分析师完全搞错的方式超出了预期并提高了指引。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the reason I am excited for it is because I looked at the numbers over the weekend. Again, if you haven't watched Paler Weekly, make sure to check that out. We went pretty deep onto the numbers and, you know, tried to give as much of an explanation as we can for what we think is going to happen. Seeking Alpha that I'm pulling up right here has the earnings estimates and the estimates from Wall Street is 1.09. 9 billion. Pounder basically guided for 1.09 billion. So, uh, the analysts aren't really raising the estimate from the company. They're basically betting that the company is going to come in line with guidance. And they've done this for basically the past 10 quarters. And what has Palanteer done? They've uh beat and raised to such a degree that the analysts completely got it wrong.</p>
</details>

分析师们似乎并没有说，“哦，好吧，也许下个季度他们不会超出预期并提高指引了。”他们继续低估，这意味着 Palantir 能否再次做到这一点完全掌握在自己手中。如果他们能做到，我认为这将是一个激动人心的季度。那么，股价会发生什么？我不知道，因为股价已经上涨了。过去几周，我在170到185美元区间买入 Palantir 的原因就是，我认为当华尔街看到50%的增长时，他们会感到兴奋，股价可能会走高。但这已经发生了。对股价上涨的预期已经兑现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's not like the analysts have really said, "Oh, well, maybe next quarter they're not going to beat and raise." continue to underestimate, which means it's totally in Palunteer's hands for if they can do the same tomorrow. And if they can, I think it's going to be an exciting quarter. Now, what's going to happen to the stock? I have no idea because the stock already made a run. I mean, I really for the past couple weeks, the reason I've been buying pounder around that 170 to 185 range is like, hey, I think when the street sees 50% growth, uh, they're going to be excited and the stock probably makes a move higher. That has already happened. So, the anticipation of the move has already taken place.</p>
</details>

现在的问题是，这个季度的业绩要好到什么程度，才能让股价涨得比我们现在看到的更高。如果 Palantir 明天跌到185美元，我也不会太难过。我知道大家会不高兴，会觉得烦，因为它已经涨到204美元了。但尽管如此，如果这么多利好已经被计入价格，而他们又没能超出预期，那就像两个季度前发生的那样。记得吗，我们当时涨到125美元，然后第二天跌到108美元。那就是我第二天上彭博社谈论 Palantir 财报的时候。所以我们见过那样的季度。但在第二季度，这种情况没有发生，因为 Palantir 确实超出了预期，并且以一种实质性的方式提高了指引。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The question now becomes how good is the quarter going to be to get the move to be even better than what we see right here. And if pounder drops to 185 tomorrow, like I can't be that upset about it. I know everyone's going to be upset and just like annoyed because it got all the way to 204. But nonetheless, it's like if so much was priced in and they weren't able to deliver beyond expectations, which is basically what happened two quarters ago. Remember, we ran up to like 125 and then we fell to 108 the next day. Uh that's the that's when I went on Bloomberg the day after to talk about pound earning. So, like we've h we've seen a quota like that before, but in Q2 that didn't happen because Palenter like really beat the estimates and they and they raised guidance in in a in a substantial way.</p>
</details>

我认为他们会达到12亿美元，超出预期1亿美元。如果他们超出1亿美元，达到12亿，并且每股收益接近25美分而不是17美分，那么如果他们能实现接近55%到57%的增长——他们需要达到50%，所以需要有7%到8%的超预期——那么，华尔街会再次说：“等一下，这是唯一一家增长如此之快的公司。这是唯一一家真正将AI付诸实践并使其有用的公司。”如果 OpenAI 想要万亿美元的估值，我知道他们的增长指标和总收入美元指标更好，但从影响力角度看，有人可能会说 Palantir 的影响更大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think they're going to come in to 1.2 billion. I think they're going to beat by 100 million. And I think if they beat by a hundred million and we get 1.2 billion and we get closer to 25 cents versus 17 cents, again, I I just like if they grow anywhere near 55 to 57% right now, they're got to get 50%. So they would have to have a little bit of a 7 to 8% beep. I mean, dude, like I Wall Street, I think once again, will say, "Wait a second. This is the only company that's growing as fast as they're growing. This is the only company that's actually implementing AI to make it useful." If OpenAI wants a trillion dollar valuation, I mean, I know their metrics are better from a growth perspective than from a total dollar revenue perspective, but from an impact perspective, one could say that Pounder is having more of an impact.</p>
</details>

Palantir 只有900个客户。我们周报里谈了很多，这可能是他们第一个季度增加100个客户。他们从未增加过三位数的客户。上个季度他们增加了77个。如果他们增加100个，并且新增了更多至少100万美元的合同——上季度好像有150个，如果这次接近175个——再加上55%到57%的营收增长，我认为股价会更高，华尔街会非常喜欢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And Pounder only has 900 customers in terms of customer count. We talked about this a lot on the weekly. This might be the first quarter where they add 100 customers. They've never added a a triple digit number of customers. I think last quarter they added 77. If they add uh 100 and they have more deals of at least a million that was added. I think last quarter they have like 150. If that gets closer to like 175 and they have that topline revenue growth of 55 to 57%. I think the stock can go higher and I think the street will really like it.</p>
</details>

现在，我是否期待这样？不。我真的想降低大家的期望。如果股价在170到180美元，我会非常肯定地说，嘿，我认为会有一波行情。但股价已经动了。所以，最聪明的人明天可能是在财报前卖出的人。人们可以在财报前卖出看涨期权，也许那会奏效。我不知道在财报前进场买看涨期权是不是最好的主意。预期的波动是10%。是的，他们在盘后下午4点报告。所以，10%的波动会让你接近220美元或180美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now am I expecting that? No. I really want to calm people's expectations down. If the stock was at 170 180, I would be gung-ho of like, hey, I think there's going to be a move. Stock made the move already. It happens. So, the smartest people tomorrow could be the people that sell before earnings. People could sell calls before earnings. Maybe that ends up working out. I don't know if buying calls going into earnings is the best idea. The expected move is 10%. Yes, they are reporting after hours 4 p.m. So, you know, a 10% move gets you closer to 220 or 180.</p>
</details>

现在来谈谈 Grab。我对明天的 Grab 感到兴奋。我在我的 Substack 上发布了深度分析。我在那篇 Substack 上披露，我现在持有超过4万股。所以，我这次是带着相当重的仓位迎接财报的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, Grabby Grab. We'll end off the show with Grabby Grab. Um, I'm excited for Grab tomorrow. I posted on my Substack, the deep dive. I disclosed on that Substack. I now have over 40,000 shares. So, your boy's walking in with a pretty heavy bag for uh for this earnings.</p>
</details>

看，关于 Grab，我整个周末都在想。我不知道股价会怎么样，真的不知道。我的直觉告诉我，他们会有一个很棒的季度。他们会超出预期并提高指引。EBITDA 指引会接近5亿美元，股价会比现在高得多。我预计在6.8到6.9美元的范围，也许会突破7美元。我认为我们会超过6.5美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look, dude. The thing about Grab, and I've been thinking about this all weekend. I've been thinking about this all weekend. I don't know what's going to happen to the stock. I really don't. My gut, like like like like my gut is telling me they're going to have a great quarter. They're going to beat and raise. Ebida guidance is going to get closer to 500 million and the stock's going to go much higher than where it is today. I'm thinking around that 680 690 range. Maybe it crosses seven. seven might be psychological, but I think we get above 650,</p>
</details>

但那只是我的直觉。我的理智告诉我，财报在晚上7:30公布。没有券商关心 Grab。没有庞大的散户社区。从晚上7:30到8:00，在流动性极差的盘后市场，任何大的波动都很难发生。而且，这是一家在新加坡时间早上8点报告财报的国际股票。所以，美国可能没有足够多的人知道明天有财报。因此，我有点认为股价会持平或者下跌，因为成交量不会很大，因为你只有30分钟的时间来对股价做出反应，财报在7:30出来，盘后市场在晚上8点关闭。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but that's what my gut tells me. What my mind tells me is that the earnings come out at 7:30. None of the brokerages care about Grab. There's not a massive retail community. You have 7:30 to 8:00 p.m. in the overnight markets or in the after hours markets that are highly illquid for any massive move to happen up or down. Uh, and then it's a it's an international stock that's reporting earnings at 8 am Singapore time. So, like there might not be enough people in the United States that even know that the earnings is happening tomorrow. And so, I kind of think that the stock's going to be flat or it's going to be red because there's just not a lot of volume that's going to be coming in because you're going to have 30 minutes to make a move on the stock because the earnings come out at 7:30 and overnight markets close at or overnight markets open at 800 p.m., but after hours close at 8 p.m. and grabbers and trade in the overnight markets.</p>
</details>

所以我认为，财报必须非常出色，才能让股价真正突破7美元。根据数据，如果你看那篇 Substack，我周末又看了更多数据，我真的认为这种走势是可能的。但话又说回来，我可能错了。如果明天没有发生，那也不会改变我的论点。这只是一个关于公众对 Grab 的看法的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I I think the earnings would have to be so substantial to get the stock to really make the move above $7, which I like I look based on the numbers. If you look at that substack, I went through even more numbers over the weekend. I I really do think that move is possible. But then again, I could be wrong. And if it doesn't happen tomorrow, then it doesn't really change my thesis. It's just a question of, you know, the public perception of what's going to happen in the context of graph.</p>
</details>

最终，关于这只股票，这是我将自己的品牌与内容创作金融游戏联系起来的第三个名字。这实际上是有史以来最酷的游戏之一，但也有其起伏。好处是，你公开地将自己与一个名字联系起来，你向世界提出了一个论点，你说：“嘿，我认为这只股票被低估了，我认为股价可以更高。”这个行业的神奇之处在于，如果股价上涨，很多人会为你分析公司的能力感到兴奋，他们开始尊重你的分析和你的分析技巧。然而，你不能只是一炮而红。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So look, ultimately on the stock, this is the third name that I associated my brand with in this content creating finance game. I it's actually, you know, it's it's it's one of the coolest games ever, but it's also with its ups and its downs. The ups are you associate yourself with a name publicly. You put out a thesis out there into the world as a human being and you say, "Hey, I think this stock is undervalued. I think the stock can go higher." And the magical thing about this industry is that if the stock goes higher, a lot of people get excited about the way you can analyze a company and they start to respect your analysis and and your skills on your analysis. However, you cannot be a one-hit wonder.</p>
</details>

我找到了 Grab。这是我找到的那一个。看，它今年上涨了25%，所以它跑赢了标普500指数。现在这个季度的问题是，他们能否真正跑赢标普？因为标普上涨了18%。所以如果我们今年收在6美元，标普收在7000点左右，标普将上涨21%，Grab 将上涨26%。这是一个不错的超越，5%，但不是一个实质性的超越。所以这就是为什么这个季度必须是一个好季度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Still doesn't make sense to me. I found Grab. That's the one that I found. And that's the And look, it's up 25% this year. So it's beating the S&P 500. The question now for this quarter is can they really outperform the S&P? Because the S&P is at 18%. So if we end out at six this year, you know, S&P ends out at like 7,000. S&P will be up 21%. Grab will be up 26%. It's a it's a decent beat, 5%, but it's not like a substantial beat. So, that's why this quarter's got to be a good one. This quarter's got to be a good one.</p>
</details>

但再说一次，我反复研究了数据。我相信它被低估了。我看了多个 DCF 模型，我认为公允价值接近9到10美元。我看了机构的交易量，这只股票84%由机构持有。我不明白为什么机构一直在大量买入，而股价却一直受压。它在九月份的成交量达到了十亿股。我可以列举一百万个不同的理由，但除非股价上涨，否则没人会真正关心。所以，明天，我们就能看到财报是否足够好，能让股价上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But again, I've gone through the numbers over and over again. I believe it's undervalued. I've looked at multiple DCFs. I think fair value is closer to 910 bucks. I've looked at the institutional volume. This thing is owned by 84% of the institutions. It does not make sense to me for why the institutions have been buying as much uh and for the stock to stay depressed. It had a billion shares of volume in September. I mean, I can go through a million different reasons, but no one's really going to care unless the stock goes up. And so, tomorrow, we get to see if the earnings are good enough for the stock to go up.</p>
</details>
