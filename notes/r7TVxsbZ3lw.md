### 本周市场展望：十一月开局与关键事件

大家好，欢迎回到新一期的周日市场期货节目。我们提前三分钟开始了直播，因为我已经准备就绪，所以觉得不妨早点开始。感谢大家的到来，希望各位度过了一个愉快的周末。朋友们，十一月已经正式开始了，这感觉有点疯狂。2025年只剩下两个月了，今天是11月2日，今年过得真快。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the Sunday market futures. We are live. We are three minutes early. I was like, you know what? I'm ready to go. we might as well get started. And we are here. Thank everybody for being here. Hope everyone had a great weekend. We've got November officially starting, folks. It's kind of crazy. It really is kind of crazy. We got two months left of 2025. It is November 2nd. Uh this year has gone relatively quick.</p>
</details>

就股市而言，十月可谓跌宕起伏。上周我们有很多内容要讨论，包括美联储的动态和大型科技公司的财报。但十月已经结束，我们现在进入了新的月份。我们有很多话题要谈，整个周末有很多事情在网上疯传，特别是关于 Sam Altman 和 Satya Nadella 的新采访，我们稍后会讨论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, October was up and down in regards to the stock market. We had a ton of stuff to cover last week with the Fed and big tech earnings, but October is done and we're here. We are live. We got a lot to talk about. We have a bunch of different things that went viral over the weekend in regards to new interviews, particularly around Sam Alman and Satia Nadella. So, we're going to talk about that.</p>
</details>

目前，特朗普正在接受哥伦比亚广播公司（CBS）的《60分钟》特别采访，因此在本次市场期货节目进行期间，可能会有大量引述流出。实际上，我们已经开始收到一些引述了，并且已经有几个采访片段。所以在整个小时内，你可能会看到很多不同的引述，我会把它们显示在屏幕上，并分析当前的情况。特朗普五分钟前刚发推文说，如果不实施关税，我们将变成一个第三世界国家。最高法院本周将审理关税案，所以这将非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, we got Trump who's doing a CBS 60inut special interview right now. So, there's likely going to be a ton of quotes coming in uh throughout the course of this uh market future show. I mean, we're already getting quotes right now. We have a couple of clips already from the interview. So throughout the entire hour, you're probably going to get a bunch of different quotes and I will put them on the screen and we'll analyze what's going on. Trump already tweeted like five minutes ago that we will be a third world country without the tariffs going into effect. The Supreme Court will be looking at the tariffs case this week. So that's going to be really important.</p>
</details>

此外，我们还有来自巴菲特的一些更新，他的伯克希尔·哈撒韦公司公布了财报。这是沃伦·巴菲特和伯克希尔·哈撒韦公司有史以来最后一个第三季度财报，所以我们会谈谈他们的一些举动。我们还有一系列宏观数据和图表需要关注，以预测十一月的市场走势。明天，**Palantir**（Palantir Technologies: 一家专注于大数据分析的美国软件公司，为政府和商业客户服务）将公布财报，所以我们会对此做一些前瞻分析。没错，今天是 Palantir 财报前夜。这应该是我为 Palantir 做的第18个季度的报道了，这很疯狂。坦白说，这可能是最好的一个季度，我们稍后会讨论。此外，还有 Grab 的财报。所以，这将是内容极其丰富的一周。明天有 Palantir 和 Grab，绝对会非常疯狂，我们会对即将发生的事情做个预览。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we'll talk about that. Uh and then we got some updates from Buffett. He had earnings with Bergkshire Hathway. This is the last Q3 ever for Warren Buffett and Birkshshire Hathway. So we'll talk about some of the stuff they did. We have a bunch of different macro stats to look at, some charts in regards to what to expect in November. And then tomorrow, you've got Palunteer earnings. So, we're going to do a little bit of a preview on that. It is indeed happy Palunteer Eve. This is what this is the uh 4812 uh 15. This is I think the 18th quarter I've covered for Pounder. Just kind of crazy. And quite frankly, it might be the best quarter. So, we're going to talk about that. And then we got Grabby Grab as well. So, I mean, this is going to be a jam-packed week. Tomorrow is going to be absolutely insane with Palunteer and Grab, and we'll do a preview on what's going on with that.</p>
</details>

### 深度分析：Nebius 的投资逻辑与护城河

在开始之前，我发布了两篇新的深度分析文章，分别是关于 Nebius 和 Grab 的。Grab 这家公司，我大约三个月前写了一份17页的深度报告。周末我对它进行了修订，并正式发布在了 **Substack**（一个允许独立作家和播客直接向订阅者发布内容的在线平台）上。链接就在那里，大家可以去看看，免费订阅，没有付费墙。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But, we have a lot a lot a lot to talk about. So, thank you everybody for being here. Before we get started, deep dives are out. Two new deep dives. We have Nebas and Grabby. Grab is a uh company that I I did a 17page deep dive on about three months ago. I I I refined the deep dive over the weekend and I officially published it on Substack. Uh, and so there's the link right there. You guys can check it out. Free to subscribe. Uh, no payw wall, anything like that.</p>
</details>

很多人都在问关于 Nebius 的文章，我也研究了它。明天我会更详细地谈论，或许节目最后如果大家有问题我们也可以聊聊。简单来说，很难不看好 Nebius，因为它提供了一种全栈集成的数据中心解决方案。我认为，那些在股价20美元时就理解了这个论点的看涨者已经获得了丰厚的回报。显然，我当时没有理解这个逻辑，也没有真正关注它。在 Substack 文章的前半部分，大约前八段，我谈到了我可能错过这个投资机会的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then Nebius, a lot of people were asking for it. And I looked at Nebas and I'll talk about it more tomorrow. Maybe we can talk about at the end of the show if people have some questions. Uh, look, it is really hard to not be bullish on Nebus Nebius from the simple perspective that it is a full stack integrated approach to data centers. And I think the bulls that understood that argument back when it was $20 have been supremely rewarded for it. Uh, I obviously did not understand that thesis, nor did I really pay attention to it. And then the first half of the the Substack or I guess the first kind of like eight paragraphs of the article, I talk about why I likely missed the story.</p>
</details>

但在130美元的价位，我计算了一下，数字就在 Substack 的文章里，其实并没有那么可怕。当然，他们能否再获得一个**Hyperscaler**（超大规模数据中心提供商，如亚马逊AWS、微软Azure和谷歌云）的合同存在很大的执行风险，但在94美元时确实是一个很好的买入点，可惜我当时只是卖出了看跌期权。不过说实话，在130美元时，情况也并不可怕，最大的风险在于执行力。但我确实认为这家公司拥有**Moat**（护城河：巴菲特推广的投资术语，指公司能够保护其长期利润和市场份额免受竞争对手攻击的可持续竞争优势）。我认为这是我一直以来对 Nebius 最关心的问题：他们到底有没有护城河，还是仅仅是另一个数据中心公司？我认为他们有。因此，这很令人兴奋。我目前还没有持仓，文章里也解释了原因，但它已经进入我2026年的观察名单，我们会看看后续发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, but at 130, look, I did the numbers. The numbers are in the chat or in in the in the chat in the substack. It's not that scary. It really isn't. Now, there is a large execution risk on if they can get another hyperscaler deal, but I mean at 94 it was a really good buy and unfortunately I just sold puts on it. But at 130, honestly, it's not that scary. The execution is the biggest risk. But I do think the company has a moat. And I think that's the biggest thing I've been concerned about, Neb, is like, do they have a moat or are they just another data center plate? I think they have a moat. And as a result, uh, it's exciting. So, I don't have a position yet. I talk about why I don't have a position in the article, but it is on my list for 2026, and we're going to see what goes on from there.</p>
</details>

我知道在 Nebius 之后，Nebius 和 Iran 之间出现了一些奇怪的争议。Nebius 的支持者讨厌 Iran，而 Iran 的支持者讨厌 Nebius。看来我现在必须对 Iran 做一个深度分析了。我会研究一下，然后也发布出来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I know after Nebius I there's some weird controversy between Nebius and Iran. It's kind of turning. Guess I have to do a deep dive on Iran now because the Nebius bulls hate Iran and Iran bulls hate Nebius. But yeah, we will uh we will see what we get going and then I'll publish that as well.</p>
</details>

### 特朗普确认中美协议，市场迎来喘息之机

首先看一下期货市场。对于那些还没看到的人来说，我认为我们将以相对上涨的态势开盘。我们上涨了0.3%。特朗普已经确认存在一项美中协议，所以我们将讨论这项协议的具体情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um futures. First of all, for those that haven't seen it, I think we're going to open up relatively green. We are up 0.3%. Trump has confirmed there is a USChina deal and so we'll talk about what's going on with the US China deal.</p>
</details>

我不确定中国方面是否已确认有正式的协议，我认为这就是我们目前市场上涨的原因。但一旦隔夜市场开盘，我们会得到更多细节，并进行讨论。我们有一些关于劳动力市场的新图表，这也很重要。过去几周我们一直在讨论劳动力市场，最引人关注的是上周的裁员数量，特别是亚马逊裁员3万人。所以我们会讨论这一点及其对劳动力市场的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know if China has confirmed that there is an official China deal and that's why I think we are green, but we're going to get some details on that uh once the overnight markets open and we'll talk about that. We have some new charts on the labor market. That's also really important to look at. We've been talking a lot about the labor market over the past couple weeks. The biggest thing that we looked at was the amount of layoffs that we had last week, especially with Amazon with those 30,000 layoffs. So, we're going to talk about that and some implications on the labor market.</p>
</details>

但总的来说，我认为目前隔夜市场上涨的原因是，特朗普和中国之间的关系似乎出现了一些稳定迹象。他们在周四会面，这在周五提振了市场。我们在十月份连续第六个月收涨，当月上涨了2.4%。通常情况下，十一月市场也相对乐观。十月份有些波动，比特币和以太坊在十月的表现不佳，也许十一月情况会有所改变，如果真是这样，那将是利好消息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But overall, I think the reason we're green right now overnight is because it looks like there's some some stability between Trump and China. again they met back on Thursday and that helped the markets on Friday. We did close green for the sixth month in a row in October. So we closed out October up 2.4% for the month. Um and then overall, you know, November is relatively green usually and so we had a bit of a choppy October. Bitcoin and Ethereum kind of sucked in October. Maybe that changes for November and if that does that would be bullish.</p>
</details>

以太坊正在获得一些提振，曾一度逼近4000美元，现在回落到3883美元。比特币也一度突破11万美元，而上周某个时候还在10.4万美元。所以，我认为如果说有哪个月份比特币和以太坊会表现出色，那很可能就是十一月，因为比特币在十一月的表现通常比十月要好一些。但我们还要看月底的具体走势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now Ethereum is getting a little bit of a boost. It was pushing 4,000. Now it's back to 38.83. Bitcoin as well pushing above 110. It was at 104 at one point last week. So, I mean, I think if there was any month for Bitcoin and Ethereum to do well, it would be November, as Bitcoin actually tends to do a little bit better in November than October. But, we're going to see how these turn out as we get into the end of the month.</p>
</details>

### OpenAI 争议：Sam Altman 的傲慢与AI的“大到不能倒”

好了，在隔夜市场开盘后，我们将深入探讨所有我准备好的话题。在此之前，让我们先看看这个视频，因为它已经彻底火了。Sam Altman 和 Satya Nadella 一起上了 Brad Gersonner 的播客。Brad Gersonner 问了一个相对简单的问题，他说：“我一直听说你们有130亿美元的收入，但你们却承诺要支出1.4万亿美元。我想我们每个人每天都在质疑，如果 OpenAI 无法兑现这些支出承诺，这会不会是一个会爆炸的泡沫？” 以下是 Sam Altman 先生对这个问题的回答。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so in about 12 minutes, we are going to have the overnight markets open and then we'll get into all the topics I've lined up after the overnight markets open. Before that, let's just take a look at this video because it has absolutely gone viral. Sam Alman was on the Brad Gersonner podcast with Satia Nadella and Brad Gersonner asked a relatively simple question which is hey I keep hearing you have 13 billion in revenue but you've committed to spend 1.4 trillion I think every day all of us question could this be a bubble that explodes if open AAI isn't able to officially spend on these commitments that they've committed to spend on and here is what Mr. Sam Alman had to say to that question.</p>
</details>

> **Brad Gersonner:** 一家年收入130亿美元的公司，如何能做出1.4万亿美元的支出承诺？你也听到了那些批评。
> **Sam Altman:** 首先，我们的收入远不止这个数。其次，Brad，如果你想卖掉你的股份，我可以帮你找个买家。
> **Brad Gersonner:** 我只是觉得，有很多人想买OpenAI的股票。
> **Sam Altman:** 包括我自己。那些对我们的计算资源等问题忧心忡忡的人，会很乐意购买股票。所以我想我们可以很快就把你的或其他任何人的股份卖给那些在Twitter上对此事大声嚷嚷的人。我们确实计划收入会急剧增长，而且收入正在急剧增长。我们正在做一个前瞻性的赌注，即它将继续增长，不仅ChatGPT会持续增长，我们还将成为重要的人工智能云之一，我们的消费设备业务将成为一项重要事务，能够自动化科学的人工智能将创造巨大价值。所以，我很少有想成为上市公司的时刻，但有一个难得的吸引人的时候，就是当那些人写着那些荒谬的“OpenAI即将倒闭”之类的文章时。我很想告诉他们，他们可以直接做空股票，我很乐意看到他们因此被烧得体无完肤。但我们有周密的计划，我们了解技术和能力将走向何方，以及我们能围绕它构建什么样的产品和创造什么样的收入。我们可能会搞砸，这是我们正在下的赌注，并随之承担一定的风险。一个确定的风险是，如果我们没有计算能力，我们将无法产生收入或制造出这种规模的模型。
> **Satya Nadella:** Brad，作为合作伙伴和投资者，我只想说一件事。我所见过的OpenAI提出的商业计划，没有一个他们没有超额完成的。所以在某种意义上，在他们的增长甚至业务方面，这是个执行力令人难以置信的地方。坦白说，很明显，每个人都在谈论OpenAI在用户和应用方面的所有成功，但我想说，总的来说，他们的业务执行力简直令人难以置信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> How, you know, how can a company with 13 billion in revenues make 1.4 trillion of spend commitments? You know, and and and you've heard the criticism.
>> First of all, we're doing well more revenue than that. Second of all, Brad, if you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer.
>> I just enough like, you know, people are I I think there's a lot of people who would love to buy OpenAI shares. I don't I don't think you want,
>> including myself. including myself
>> who talk with a lot of like breathless concern about our comput stuff or whatever that would be thrilled to buy shares. So I think we we could sell you know your shares or anybody else's to some of the people who are making the most noise on Twitter whatever about this very quickly. We do plan for revenue to grow steeply. Revenue is growing steeply. We are taking a forward bet that it's going to continue to grow grow and that not only will chache keep growing but we will be able to become one of the important AI clouds that our consumer device business will be a significant and important thing that AI that can automate science will create huge value. So, you know, there are not many times that I want to be a public company, but one of the rare times it's appealing is when those people are writing these ridiculous open AI is about to go out of business and you know, whatever. I would love to tell them they could just short the stock and I would love to see them get burned on that. Um, but you know, I we carefully plan, we understand where the technology, where the capability is going to grow, go and and how the products we can build around that and the revenue we can generate. we might screw it up like this is the bet that we're making and we're taking a risk along with that. A certain risk is if we don't have the compute, we will not be able to generate the revenue or make the models at these at this kind of scale.
>> Exactly. And
>> let me just say one thing uh Brad as both a partner and um an investor there is not been a single business plan that I've seen from OpenAI that they have put in and not beaten it. So in some sense this is the one place where you know in terms of their growth and just even the business it's been unbelievable execution quite frankly I mean obviously openai everyone talks about all the success in the usage and what have you but even um I would say all up uh the business execution has been just pretty unbelievable.</p>
</details>

这个片段之所以在周末疯传，原因在于，当我看到它时也感到非常惊讶。首先，这是一个合理的问题。博通、甲骨文、AMD、英伟达，根据《华尔街日报》上周的一篇文章，仅凭与英伟达达成的交易公告，它们的市值就增加了6300亿美元。AMD 的股价之所以能达到250美元，唯一的原因就是与 OpenAI 的这笔交易。就是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, so the reason that went so viral over the weekend, we got about nine minutes till the overnight markets open and uh then we'll get into all the other topics. But the reason that went viral and when I saw it, I was quite surprised as well is number one, it's a legit question. Okay, Broadcom, Oracle, AMD, Nvidia, there was an article last week from the Wall Street Journal have gained 630 billion in market cap just from the announcements of the deals that they have uh committed to Nvidia. I mean AMD probably will be stuck at $158 a share for everyone. I know there's a big retail army in AMD. The o the literal only reason that stock is at 250 is because of this opening eye deal. That's it.</p>
</details>

所以，当 Brad Gersonner，顺便说一句，他是过去两年 OpenAI 最大的投资者之一，在2023年的私募轮中早期进入，他对公司非常了解。当你最大的支持者问你一个非常简单的问题时，他基本上是在给你送分，而不是想给你设陷阱。这家伙持有你大量的股票，他为什么要让你难堪？他是在给你一个机会，让你简单地解释。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it is so and the reason is not to downplay the significance of that deal. It's rather to un to underwrite how important the deal is and the spending commitments that are necessary to get AMD to that $400 billion market cap or to get Oracle to that $800 billion market cap which is pledged from OpenAI. So when Brad Gersonner who by the way is one of the bigger investors from the previous two years he was early in 2023 in the private rounds of OpenAI so he knows the company very well. When your biggest supporter is asking you a very simple question he's basically giving you a layup. He's not trying to give you a gotcha question. this guy has a ton of your stock. Why would he be trying to make you look bad? He's trying to give you the opportunity to simply say this</p>
</details>

如果是我，我会说：“看，很多人以为我们年收入130亿美元，实际上我们远不止于此。”他这么说并不会撒谎，我估计他们的收入接近250亿美元。其次，“我们的预测是到2027年，我们可能会达到三位数，也就是大约1000亿美元的收入。”Sam Altman 后来在播客中也提到了这一点，但他用一种有点自负的方式说的。他本可以简单地回答问题，说：“看，我们预测，虽然不确定能否实现，但我们认为到2027年可以达到1000亿美元的收入，这使得1.4万亿美元的支出看起来就不那么疯狂了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">is if obviously I'm all I would be like look a lot of people think we're doing 13 billion in revenue. We are doing significantly more than that which he wouldn't be lying about. I think the estimate is closer to 25 billion in revenue. Number two, our estimates are that by 2027 we're probably going to be hitting triple digits. So about 100 billion in revenue, which Sam Alman mentions a little bit later in the podcast, but he does it in kind of like a an egotistic way, right? He makes like he he kind of says it he says it in a way that's bragging when in reality he could have just answered the question be like look we're projecting we don't know if it's going to happen but we think by 2027 we could get to 100 billion revenue which makes the 1.4 4 trillion spend, which is only about 14 times the amount of revenue they're they're bringing in. Not look as crazy as the $1 13 billion annual run rate.</p>
</details>

然后他本可以说：“让别人说去吧。我们有像你这样了不起的人支持我们，Brad。我们有 Satya、Jensen 和 Lisa Su 这样了不起的人支持我们。正因为有这些非常聪明的人支持我们公司和我们的成长，我们非常有信心能够兑现我们公开承诺的支出。” 就这样，他只需要说这些。这对他来说是一个绝佳的机会，去称赞所有信任他公司会成功的人。他可以回敬一句赞美，说因为他们如此相信我们，我们非常兴奋能继续这段旅程。那样事情就结束了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then he could have said, you know, let people say whatever they want to say. We have amazing people like you, Brad, that support us. We have amazing people like Satia and Jensen and Lisa Sue that support us. And because we have all these really smart people supporting our company and our growth, we are very confident that we're going to be able to commit to the spending that we have said that we're going to commit to publicly. That's it. That's all you have to say. That's literally all he It was such a layup for him to give a compliment to all the people that are trusting that his company's going to succeed. He could give them a compliment back and say because they believe in us so much, you know, we're so excited to continue working on this journey. And that would have been the end of it.</p>
</details>

但他却变成了一个自恋狂，说什么“我真希望我们是上市公司，这样我就可以告诉人们去做空股票了”。他想模仿 Karp 的那一套，但问题是，Karp 之所以是 Karp，是因为很少有人能模仿他的做法而依然保持魅力。大多数尝试这样做的人不会有魅力，只会显得像个混蛋。而他最终就是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Instead, he turns into this like narcissistic, oh, I wish we were a public company so I could tell people to short the stock. He tried to pull a Karp moment and it's like there's a reason Karp is Karp. Very few people can emulate what Karp does and still be relatively charismatic. Most people that try to do that are not going to be charismatic. They're going to just seem like dicks. And uh you know that's that's what he ended up doing.</p>
</details>

这是一个进退两难的局面。即使你讨厌 Sam Altman，即使那个片段让你非常生气，即使你觉得这家伙油滑，不想和他有任何瓜葛，但如果你投资了这个市场，你就必须相信 OpenAI 会赢。就这么简单。我很想听听任何人的分析，告诉我 OpenAI 可以输，而 AI 牛市还能继续，因为我看过数据。我正在写一篇关于这个问题的 Substack 文章，下周会发布，结论是 OpenAI 根本不可能输。他们基本上是“大到不能倒”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's like even if you hate Sam Alman, even if that clip pissed you off so much, even if you think this guy is squirmy and you just want nothing to do with him, if you are invested in this market, you have to believe OpenAI is going to win. It is just that simple. And I would love any analysis from someone telling me that OpenAI can lose and the AI bull market can continue because I've looked at the numbers. I'm working on a Substack piece about this coming out next week and it it there is no way OpenAI essentially they're too big to fail. It's just that simple.</p>
</details>

你可以说，“那 XAI 和 Gemini 呢？” 当然。但 AMD 市值达到4000亿美元是因为 OpenAI。Oracle 逼近7000-8000亿美元也是因为 OpenAI。Nvidia 市值增加到那个程度，在某种程度上也是因为 OpenAI。所以，归根结底，除非像 Gemini 或 XAI 这样的公司能大规模超越 ChatGPT 每周8亿的活跃用户，否则 OpenAI 似乎是太大而不能倒。因此，他们必须赢。所以，如果你投资了 AI 生态系统，你就必须为他们的成功加油。但运营这家公司的人，在回答那个问题的方式上，显然不是最有魅力的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They're too big to fail given this. And you can say, "Oh, well, what about XAI Gemini?" Sure. But the reason AMD is at a $400 billion market cap is because of OpenAI. The reason Oracle is pushing 700 800 billion is because of OpenAI. The reason Nvidia to an extent has added the level of market cap that's added is because of OpenAI. So, at the end of the day, it's like unless a company like Gemini or or uh XAI massively overtake the 800 million weekly activives that CHABT has, feels like opening eye is too big. And as a result, they kind of have to win. So you kind of have to root for their success if you're invested in the AI ecosystem. But the guy who's running it is obviously not the most charismatic in terms of how we answer that question.</p>
</details>

### 英伟达的中国困境：Jensen Huang 与特朗普的博弈

我很高兴英伟达股价上涨了近1%，因为特朗普在CBS的采访中确实说过，他和Jensen谈过，并且他们一致认为**Blackwell**（英伟达公司推出的一款旗舰级人工智能芯片架构）不应该卖给我们最大的竞争对手。我不知道Jensen是否同意这一点，也不知道这对Blackwell芯片意味着什么，我绝对不认为我们短期内能从中国获得收入。

<p class="english-text">Now, I I'm I'm happy that Nvidia is up almost 1% because Trump did say in that CBS interview that um I talked to Jensen and essentially he said that we agreed that Blackwell should not be going well, he agreed. I don't know if Jensen agreed that Blackwell should not be going to our biggest competitors. I don't know what that necessarily means for Blackwell chips and I definitely don't think we're getting China revenue anytime soon.</p>
</details>

特朗普确实暗示，Blackwell 可能短期内不会进入中国。因此，英伟达股价实际上涨了而不是跌了，我认为这是个好现象。

<details>

<p class="english-text">But, uh, Trump did kind of signal that, you know, maybe Blackwell is not going to be going to China anytime soon. So, the fact that Nvidia is actually up and not going down on that, I think is nice to see.</p>
</details>

这是 Jensen。他今天早上在福克斯新闻上，这是他关于中国、特朗普以及当前局势的全部言论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, let's get into it. I think we'll start off with uh this Jensen interview because this probably frames a lot of stuff that we got to talk about. So this was Jensen. He was on Fox this morning and this is everything that he had to say about China, Trump, what's going on.</p>
</details>

> **Jensen Huang:** 首先，人工智能是一场工业革命，这是我们时代最重要的技术，甚至可能是所有时代中最重要的技术。当特朗普总统刚上任时，他希望我们将这些关键技术在国内生产。他想让美国再工业化，他希望能源增长，他希望确保美国在人工智能领域处于领先地位。为了做到这一点，我们需要在能源、芯片、构建AI基础设施和工厂方面领先，当然也包括在构建AI模型方面领先，以及在医疗、制造、机器人、科学和工业等各个行业应用AI。他希望在他的政府中实现这一点，并希望以光速进行。所以我告诉他，通过与台积电（TSMC）——一个对美国来说非常了不起的合作伙伴——以及富士康（Foxconn）、纬创（Wistron）、安靠（Amcor）和Spill的合作，我们将在9个月内将制造业带回美国。我们现在已经能够在美国完全生产世界上最先进的AI芯片。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, first of all, AI is a industrial revolution and this is the most important technology of our time, potentially the most important technology of all time. And when President Trump first took office, uh he wanted us to manufacture these critical technologies on shore. He wanted to re-industrialize the United States. He wants to have energy growth. He wants to make sure that United States is a leader in artificial intelligence. And in order to do in order to do so, we need to lead in energy. We need to lead in chips. We need to lead in building AI infrastructures and factories including lead in building AI models of course, but also using AI in all the different applications in various industries from healthcare to manufacturing to robotics to you know science and and industry. So uh he wanted he wanted that uh in his administration and he wanted it at the speed of light and so I told him that we would bring manufacturing back within 9 months with the partnership of TSMC which is an incredible partner for the United States Foxcon Wistron Amcor and Spill we've been able to manufacture now the most advanced AI chip in the world completely in the United States</p>
</details>

> **Jensen Huang:** 这是一次里程碑式的会晤，一项里程碑式的协议，一项历史性的协议。我读到的所有新闻报道都显示，两位总统之间，以及两国之间，建立了一种尊重和友好的关系。因此，我希望这能为英伟达创造条件，让我们能够重返中国市场竞争。在特朗普45届政府期间，他为美国在技术领域领先定下了完美的基调，确保美国公司拥有最好和最先的技术，并让美国科技公司走向世界去竞争和获胜。在过去四年里，本届政府让我们走上了一条适得其反的道路。这些政策确实事与愿违。当特朗普总统离任时，我们在中国这个世界上最重要的市场之一拥有95%的市场份额，而现在英伟达在中国的市场份额是0%。所以，现在是时候了，这是一个绝佳的机会，让我们重置回特朗普45届政府的政策，让美国AI公司能够去中国，在市场上竞争，并能够在全球范围内传播和推广美国的技术标准，以便我们能够制定全球标准，让世界建立在美国标准之上，从而引领世界。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, what an achievement. This is a milestone meeting, a milestone deal, a historic deal. And the readouts uh from from all the news that I've read uh just the respectful uh the friendly relationship that they've built uh between the two presidents and of course between the two countries. Therefore, uh the the post from Secretary Heg Heath and uh and all the readouts from uh Secretary Bessant have have all been extraordinary. You know, this really creates the conditions I hope uh for Nvidia to be able to go back and compete in market in China. Trump 45 in the in President Trump's first administration. Uh he set the tone perfectly for America to lead in technology and make sure that America American companies have the best and first but for American technology companies to go around the world to compete and win. In the last four years, the administration really set us on a path that really backfired. the policies have really backfired from a 95% market share in in the China market which is one of the most important markets in the world when President Trump left office and video's market share in China is now 0%. And so this is really time and it's a great great opportunity for us to reset back to the Trump 45 policies for the Trump 45 policies where AI American AI companies are able to go around go to China compete for compete in the marketplace and be able to diffuse and and proliferate American technology standards around the world so that we could set global standards so that uh the world is built on American standards so that we could lead the world.</p>
</details>

这是 Jensen 的评论。很多人将其解读为中国市场即将回归。显然，他并没有说中国市场会回归，他说的是希望特朗普和习近平的协议能为英伟达带来中国市场的收入，或者说希望英伟达能重新获得在中国的市场份额，因为现在他们的市场份额是零。然后，20分钟前，你听到了特朗普的这番话，这就是为什么我对英伟达在隔夜市场上涨感到惊讶。但这就是他关于 Blackwell 的原话。

<details>
<不>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So that was the comment by Jensen. A lot of people interpreted that as China's coming back. Obviously he did not say China's coming back. He's saying hopefully the uh implications of the Trump and Xi deal will lead to China revenue or will will lead to China market share hopefully coming back for Nvidia because right now their market share is zero. And then 20 minutes ago you had this from Trump which is why I was surprised Nvidia is actually up in the overnight markets. But this is exactly what he said about Blackwell.</p>
</details>

> **记者:** 你打算和他会面吗？
> **特朗普:** 我经常和他会面，他是我这个时代最伟大的天才之一。他的芯片比任何人都领先10年。这是一家伟大的美国公司，现在是世界上最大的公司。新出的 Blackwell 芯片比其他任何芯片都领先10年。但除了说声“恭喜”之外，没什么好谈的。我们不把那个芯片给别人。
> **记者:** 你会在白宫会见叙利亚总统吗？
> **特朗普:** 我们不把那个芯片给别人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So are you planning to meet with him? you said when you were
>> I meet with look he's one of the great geniuses of our time his chips are 10 year years ahead of anybody else's and you know I meet with him all the time he's a great it's a great American company it's now the biggest company in the world uh so what would you like to know is a is really just a brilliant company the chips are 10 years the new blackwell that just came out it's 10 years ahead of every other chip But there's nothing to meet with other than say congratulations.
>> But no, we don't give that chip to other people.
>> We don't give that ship to other people.
>> Are you meeting with the Syrian president at the White House?
>> That last sentence, we don't give that chip to other people.</p>
</details>

那最后一句话，“我们不把那个芯片给别人”。所以，也许特朗普只是这么说，因为他想在与中国的谈判中获得更多筹码。但正如你所见，他明确表示，“我们不把那个芯片给别人”，这意味着如果特朗普对英伟达保持类似立场，Blackwell 芯片的收入很可能不会来自中国。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, look, maybe Trump is just saying that because he wants to get a little bit more of a negotiation on what we get with China. Uh, but as you can see, he clearly said, "We don't give that chip to other people." which means the blackwell chip is likely not coming back in terms of revenue if this is the similar stance that Trump is going to have on Nvidia.</p>
</details>

那么贸易关系到底发生了什么？这是昨晚发布在美国政府官网（US.gov）上的内容，他们是这么说的：中方将暂停新的稀土出口管制，为稀土出口颁发通用许可证，采取重大措施阻止芬太尼流入美国，暂停自3月4日以来的所有报复性关税和非关税措施，并购买至少1200万公吨的美国大豆。美方将把关税降低10%，从57%降至47%，并将**Section 301 tariffs**（301条款关税：根据美国《1974年贸易法》第301条款，美国政府对被认为存在不公平贸易行为的国家的商品加征的关税）的豁免期限延长至2026年11月。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now what actually happened with the trade relations? So this came out last night. This was published on the US.gov website and this is exactly what they said. The Chinese are going to suspend new rare earth export controls. They're going to issue general licenses for exports of rare earths. They're going to take significant measures to end the flow of fentinel to the US. They're going to suspend all retaliatory tariffs since March 4th. suspend all retaliatory non-tariff measures since March 4th and purchase at least 12 million metric tonses of US soybeans. The US is going to lower tariffs by 10% from uh 57 to 47, extend the expiration of section 301 tariff exclusions until November 2026 published by the White House yesterday.</p>
</details>

其中没有任何内容表明中国将正式获得 Blackwell 芯片，但我认为这让市场松了一口气，因为年底可能爆发的大规模贸易战似乎不会发生了。当然，中方还需要确认这一点，但我认为他们已经购买了一些大豆以示诚意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So nothing in that says that China will officially get Blackwell, but I think it's giving the market a lot of ease now that there's not this massive trade war that might break out towards the end of the year. Obviously, the Chinese have to confirm this, but I think they already bought some soybeans as a sign of good faith.</p>

### 美国经济的双重景象：“财富效应”与消费疲软

现在，为什么理解这一点非常重要？好吧，我将在这里展示一些东西，对于那些没有看过这些汇总数据的人来说，仔细看看其实非常非常重要。看看这个，这些是一些非常重要的消费类股票的年初至今回报率。Chipotle，我们上周都看到了他们财报的情况，CEO亲口说，年收入低于10万美元、年龄在25到34岁之间的人进店消费减少了。Wendy's 今年下跌了44%，我甚至都不知道是这样。Lululemon 简直是一场灾难，下跌了54%。Whirlpool 下跌35%，尽管他们的财报不错。Macy's 下跌27%。Caesars 下跌38%。Under Armour 下跌36%。当你看到这些消费类股票时，情况有点难看。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Now, why is that really important to understand? Well, I'm about to show something right here and uh for those that haven't seen this aggregated data, it's actually really really important to to take a look at. So, so take a look at this right here. These are the year-to-ate returns on some very important consumer stocks. Chipotle, we all saw last week what happened with their earnings. The CEO literally said people making less than 100,000 from ages 25 to 34 are not entering the store as much. Wendy's was down 44% this year. I didn't even know that was the case. Lululemon, that's been a train wreck, down 54%. Whirlpool down 35%, although they did have good earnings. Macy's down 27%. Caesars down 38%. Under Arour down 36. I mean, it's a little ugly when you look at these consumer stocks.</p>
</details>

这里有另一张图表显示了更多信息。金宝汤公司、通用磨坊、卡夫亨氏、高露洁、宝洁。这些是今年表现最差的股票。所以，这里有两个微妙的观点。第一，这些公司是世界上最好的公司吗？可能不是。我想英伟达、微软、亚马逊、谷歌等的执行力要比宝洁和Lululemon好得多。但其次，我认为人们开始思考消费者到底怎么了，因为这些都是面向消费者的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's another chart that shows even more. the Camples company, General Mills, Craft Hind, Colgate, uh, Proctor and Gamble. These have been the worst performing stocks of the entire year. So, there's two kind of nuanced points around this. Number one is has has have these companies been the best companies in the world. Probably not. I would imagine Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, etc. are executing a lot better than Proctor and Gamble and and Lululemon. So, that that's the first point. But second of all, the reason I think people are starting to wonder what's going on with the consumer is because these are consumer oriented companies</p>
</details>

这引出了关于**Wealth Effect**（财富效应：指由于资产价格上涨，人们感觉自己更富有，从而倾向于增加消费的经济现象）的讨论。这是本周末《The Compound and Friends》节目中一个两到三分钟的片段，讨论了财富效应这个概念，因为这似乎是经济能够支撑住的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Having said that, this leads into the conversation around the wealth effect. Here is a two to three minute clip from the compound and friends this weekend talking about this idea of the wealth effect because again that is why it looks like the economy is holding up.</p>
</details>

> **主持人:** 我想深入探讨一下，因为这是我每周都愿意为之辩护的观点。我是财富效应的忠实信徒。我认为这是经济中最重要的因素，没有之一。它决定了就业，决定了人们是否能加薪，我认为它还决定了**Capex**（Capital Expenditure: 资本支出，指公司用于购买、维护或升级固定资产（如设备、建筑）的资金）支出项目。没有什么比股价下跌30%更能迅速阻止AI资本支出的了。因此，我认为我们低估了股市影响实体经济的能力。比以往任何时候都多的美国人拥有**401(k)**（401(k)计划：美国的一种由雇主赞助的退休储蓄计划，允许员工将一部分工资投入到投资账户中，通常享受税收优惠）。我理解住房对中产阶级来说是更大的资产，等等，我都明白。但那些为别人工作的人，他们关心自己所在公司的股票期权。我认为这是一个巨大的驱动力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I want to double click on that because like this is the hill that I like to die on every week. I'm a wealth effect truther. I think it's the number one most important factor in the economy, bar none. It decides employment. It decides whether or not people get wage increases. I think it decides capex spending projects. Nothing will halt AI capex in its tracks faster than a stock price that falls 30%. Nothing. And so, as a result, I really think we underpric the ability of the stock market to influence things that happen in the real economy. Um, more Americans than ever are in 401ks. I understand housing is a bigger asset for the middle class, blah blah blah. I get all that. The people that work for people though, those people, they care about their stock options in the companies they work for. I just I think it's a huge driver.</p>
</details>

> **主持人:** 福特和通用汽车的股价今年至少跑赢了特斯拉。福特基本上处于两年高位。为什么？因为他们能卖出更多的车。为什么能卖出更多的车？因为人们有更多的钱，不仅仅是来自薪水，还因为他们持有资产。即使只是他们的401(k)，他们也感觉更富有了。这就是财富效应的整个概念。他们能够买更多的车，而这些车相对比特斯拉便宜。所以，从这个角度看，你会问，通用汽车怎么可能在一天内上涨20%，就像两周前那样？这可能就是因为财富效应。需求从未减弱，因为每个人的股票投资组合都处于历史高位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I I and I I think this is a really important point. Ford and GM have out or GM has at least outperformed Tesla this year. Ford's basically trading at a two-year high. Why? They're able to sell more cars. Why are they able to sell more cars? Because people have more money, not just because of their paychecks, but because they're holding on to assets. Even if it's just their 401k, they feel richer. That's the whole concept of the wealth effect. And they're able to buy more cars and those cars are relatively cheaper than a Tesla. So, I mean, from that perspective, you ask yourself, how is GM going up 20% in a day like it did two weeks ago? It might be because of this wealth effect. The demand never let up because everyone's stock portfolio is at a record high.</p>
</details>

我认为这是一个很好的观点，我们不能忽视。另一个来自该节目的数据非常有趣：35岁左右的人，他们净资产中股票的比例是23%。而对于婴儿潮一代，当他们35岁时，这个比例是7%。这是一个巨大的差异。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, look, I think it's a good point. I think it's something we cannot ignore. And what's really important is another stat from the show that was that was just very intriguing to me. People in their early 30s or I think it's mid-30s, 35 years old, they their percentage of uh equities as a percentage of their net worth in this generation. So I guess millennials you can call it 23%. So if you are around 35 in that you know early 30s range, mid-30s range, 23% of your net worth on an aggregate is in equities. For the boomers when they were 35 years old, it was 7%. That is a massive difference, right?</p>
</details>

所以，当股市由科技股引领时，大多数35岁及以下的人投资的是英伟达、特斯拉、亚马逊这些他们真正理解的公司，是他们能亲眼看到技术的公司。这些公司正是那些上涨并表现良好的公司。因此，几十年前净资产中只有7%是股票，而现在是23%，这对人们的财富感或至少是财富认知产生了巨大影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so when you have a stock market with technology stocks that are leading the way, most people 35 and younger, right? Nvidia, Tesla, Amazon, the companies that they actually understand, the companies that they can see the technology in front of their face, those are the companies they're investing in, those are the companies that have gone up, those are the companies that have done well. So when 7% decades ago as a result of your net worth was in equities versus 23% it makes a vast difference on the level of wealth or at least the perception of wealth that people think that they have.</p>
</details>

### AI 时代下的劳动力市场：就业机会正在减少吗？

看看这个。黑色线是标普500指数，蓝色线是总职位空缺数。中间是ChatGPT于2022年11月正式推出的时间点。如你所见，标普500指数在走高，对于我们这些持有资产的人来说，我们变得更富有了。而就业市场却在恶化，尽管失业率仍低于5%，这在历史上不算糟糕。但总职位空缺数在下降。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, take a look at this. Uh S&P 500 in in the black and then chatbt or sorry, total job openings in the blue. Uh CHBT is in the middle right there. November 2022 when it officially launched. As you can see, the S&P 500 is going higher, and for all of us that own assets, we are getting richer. The job market is getting worse, even though employment is still below 5%, which is historically not bad. Uh, but as you can see, total job openings are going down.</p>
</details>

因此，人们开始思考，这个该死的AI会不会让股东们富裕，却让其他人变穷，因为没人有工作了，这最终也会在某个时候伤害到股东。我不知道，但根据这样的图表，这似乎正在发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And as a result, it's one of those things where people are starting to wonder, wait a second, is this damn AI thing going to make shareholders rich, but going to leave everybody else poor because no one's going to have a job, which eventually will hurt shareholders at some point. And I don't know, but based on a chart like this, it seems rather obvious that this is playing out.</p>
</details>

再看另一件事。这是《华尔街日报》的数据，亚马逊的员工数量，和微软一样，都在下降。经过最近一轮裁员后，亚马逊的员工数比2021年有所减少，而且可能还会有更多裁员。微软的员工数也比峰值下降了6%。大型科技公司曾经雇佣的总人数似乎已经达到了顶峰。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's another thing right here to take a look at. So, Amazon.com employees, this is from the Wall Street Journal. As you can see, take a look right there, along with Microsoft is down. Amazon is down from 2021 after the recent round of layoffs, which likely some more layoffs are coming. And then Microsoft is down 6% from the peak. It seems like the total amount of jobs that the big tech companies have used to employ has reached the peak</p>
</details>

我认为，大型科技公司未来拥有的员工数量极不可能超过2021年的水平。原因有二：第一，他们在疫情期间过度招聘。第二，他们根本不需要那么多人。在AI时代，我很难想象我们还能拥有历史上那么多的工作岗位。这对我们所有人来说，都将是一个有趣的实验。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I think it is very unlikely like I'm just you know just looking at these charts and then anecdotally looking at what's going on in the world of AI it seems very unlikely that the big tech companies are ever going to have more employees than they had back in 2021. Uh for two reasons. Number one they overhired during the pandemic. So that was one thing that contributed to that many new employees. Number two is like they just don't need that many people. They just don't need that many people. and so I don't know in the age of AI, it seems very difficult for me to imagine that we are actually going to have the amount of jobs that we've had open historically and it's going to be an interesting experiment for all of us to kind of play out.</p>
</details>

### 万众瞩目的财报前瞻：Palantir 与 Grab

好了，Palantir，我们来谈谈它。首先，谁感到兴奋？Palantir 的财报就在明天。我想这应该是我在频道上公开报道的第18个季度了，真有点疯狂。但我确实很兴奋，因为我周末看了数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, Palinger, let's talk about it. Let's talk about it. First of all, who's excited? Who's excited? We'll talk about Grab after, but Palanteer is tomorrow. I think this is officially the 18th quarter I'll be covering publicly on the channel. It's kind of crazy, dude. Um, but I am pretty excited for it. Now, the reason I am excited for it is because I looked at the numbers over the weekend.</p>
</details>

Seeking Alpha 上的盈利预测显示，华尔街的预期是10.9亿美元，这基本上就是 Palantir 自己给出的指引。所以分析师们并没有真正提高预期，他们基本上是在赌公司会符合指引。过去十个季度他们基本都是这么做的。而 Palantir 做了什么？他们每次都超出预期并上调指引，以至于分析师们完全错了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Seeking Alpha that I'm pulling up right here has the earnings estimates and the estimates from Wall Street is 1.09. 9 billion. Pounder basically guided for 1.09 billion. So, uh, the analysts aren't really raising the estimate from the company. They're basically betting that the company is going to come in line with guidance. And they've done this for basically the past 10 quarters. And what has Palanteer done? They've uh beat and raised to such a degree that the analysts completely got it wrong.</p>
</details>

这意味着，明天他们能否再次做到这一点，完全掌握在 Palantir 自己手中。如果他们能做到，我认为这将是一个激动人心的季度。现在，股价会怎么样？我不知道，因为股价已经涨了一波了。过去几周，我在170到185美元区间买入 Palantir 的原因就是，我认为当华尔街看到50%的增长时，他们会感到兴奋，股价可能会走高。但这已经发生了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">which means it's totally in Palunteer's hands for if they can do the same tomorrow. And if they can, I think it's going to be an exciting quarter. Now, what's going to happen to the stock? I have no idea because the stock already made a run. I mean, I really for the past couple weeks, the reason I've been buying pounder around that 170 to 185 range is like, hey, I think when the street sees 50% growth, uh, they're going to be excited and the stock probably makes a move higher. That has already happened.</p>
</details>

我认为他们会达到12亿美元的收入，也就是超出预期1亿美元。如果他们能超出1亿美元，达到12亿，并且每股收益接近25美分而不是17美分，如果他们的增长率接近55%到57%，那么华尔街会再次说：“等一下，这是唯一一家增长如此之快的公司。这是唯一一家真正在实施AI并使其发挥作用的公司。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think they're going to come in to 1.2 billion. I think they're going to beat by 100 million. And I think if they beat by a hundred million and we get 1.2 billion and we get closer to 25 cents versus 17 cents, again, I I just like if they grow anywhere near 55 to 57% right now, they're got to get 50%. So they would have to have a little bit of a 7 to 8% beep. I mean, dude, like I Wall Street, I think once again, will say, "Wait a second. This is the only company that's growing as fast as they're growing. This is the only company that's actually implementing AI to make it useful."</p>
</details>

如果他们能做到营收增长55%到57%，新增百万美元级别合同的客户数从上季度的150个增加到175个左右，并且首次单季度新增客户数达到三位数，我认为股价还能继续上涨，华尔街会非常喜欢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If they add uh 100 and they have more deals of at least a million that was added. I think last quarter they have like 150. If that gets closer to like 175 and they have that topline revenue growth of 55 to 57%. I think the stock can go higher and I think the street will really like it.</p>
</details>

现在，我是否期待这种情况发生？不。我真的想降低大家的期望。如果股价在170到180美元，我会非常肯定地说，我认为会有一次上涨。但股价已经动了。所以，明天最聪明的人可能是那些在财报前卖出的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now am I expecting that? No. I really want to calm people's expectations down. If the stock was at 170 180, I would be gung-ho of like, hey, I think there's going to be a move. Stock made the move already. It happens. So, the smartest people tomorrow could be the people that sell before earnings.</p>
</details>

接下来是 Grab。我对明天的 Grab 财报感到兴奋。我在我的 Substack 上发布了深度分析，并披露我现在持有超过4万股。所以，我带着相当重的仓位迎接这次财报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, Grabby Grab. We'll end off the show with Grabby Grab. Um, I'm excited for Grab tomorrow. I posted on my Substack, the deep dive. I disclosed on that Substack. I now have over 40,000 shares. So, your boy's walking in with a pretty heavy bag for uh for this earnings.</p>
</details>

我不知道股价会发生什么。我真的不知道。我的直觉告诉我，他们会有一个很棒的季度，会超出预期并上调指引。**EBITDA**（Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization: 税息折旧及摊销前利润，是衡量公司核心盈利能力的一个指标）指引会接近5亿美元，股价会比现在高得多，我想到达6.8到6.9美元的区间，也许会突破7美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look, dude. The thing about Grab, and I've been thinking about this all weekend. I've been thinking about this all weekend. I don't know what's going to happen to the stock. I really don't. My gut, like like like like my gut is telling me they're going to have a great quarter. They're going to beat and raise. Ebida guidance is going to get closer to 500 million and the stock's going to go much higher than where it is today. I'm thinking around that 680 690 range. Maybe it crosses seven. seven might be psychological, but I think we get above 650,</p>
</details>

但我的理智告诉我，财报在7:30发布，没有券商关心 Grab，没有庞大的散户社区。从7:30到8:00的盘后交易市场流动性很差，难以出现大幅上涨或下跌。而且这是一家在新加坡时间早上8点发布财报的国际股票。所以，可能美国没有足够多的人知道明天有财报。因此，我有点觉得股价会持平或者下跌，因为成交量不大。

<details>

<p class="english-text">but that's what my gut tells me. What my mind tells me is that the earnings come out at 7:30. None of the brokerages care about Grab. There's not a massive retail community. You have 7:30 to 8:00 p.m. in the overnight markets or in the after hours markets that are highly illquid for any massive move to happen up or down. Uh, and then it's a it's an international stock that's reporting earnings at 8 am Singapore time. So, like there might not be enough people in the United States that even know that the earnings is happening tomorrow. And so, I kind of think that the stock's going to be flat or it's going to be red because there's just not a lot of volume that's going to be coming in</p>

最终，关于这只股票，这是我作为财经内容创作者，与我的品牌关联的第三个名字。这是一场最酷的游戏，但也有起有落。好处是，你公开与一个名字关联，向世界提出一个论点，说：“嘿，我认为这只股票被低估了，我认为它能涨得更高。”这个行业的神奇之处在于，如果股价上涨，很多人会因为你分析公司的能力而兴奋，并开始尊重你的分析和技巧。然而，你不能只是一鸣惊人。

<p class="english-text">Ultimately on the stock, this is the third name that I associated my brand with in this content creating finance game. I it's actually, you know, it's it's it's one of the coolest games ever, but it's also with its ups and its downs. The ups are you associate yourself with a name publicly. You put out a thesis out there into the world as a human being and you say, "Hey, I think this stock is undervalued. I think the stock can go higher." And the magical thing about this industry is that if the stock goes higher, a lot of people get excited about the way you can analyze a company and they start to respect your analysis and and your skills on your analysis. However, you cannot be a one-hit wonder.</p>

我找到了 Grab。这是我找到的那一个。看，它今年上涨了25%，跑赢了标普500指数。现在这个季度的问题是，他们能否真正跑赢标普？因为标普上涨了18%。所以，如果今年我们收在6美元，而标普涨到7000点，那么标普将上涨21%，Grab将上涨26%。这是一个不错的领先，5%，但不是一个巨大的领先。所以，这就是为什么这个季度必须是一个好季度。

<p class="english-text">I found Grab. That's the one that I found. And that's the And look, it's up 25% this year. So it's beating the S&P 500. The question now for this quarter is can they really outperform the S&P? Because the S&P is at 18%. So if we end out at six this year, you know, S&P ends out at like 7,000. S&P will be up 21%. Grab will be up 26%. It's a it's a decent beat, 5%, but it's not like a substantial beat. So, that's why this quarter's got to be a good one. This quarter's got to be a good one.</p>

但话说回来，我一遍又一遍地看过数据。我相信它被低估了。我看过多个DCF模型，我认为公允价值接近9到10美元。我看过机构成交量，这只股票84%由机构持有。我不明白为什么机构一直在大量买入，而股价却一直受压。它在九月份有十亿股的成交量。我可以列举一百万个不同的理由，但除非股价上涨，否则没人会真正关心。所以，明天，我们就能看到财报是否足够好，能让股价上涨。

<p class="english-text">But again, I've gone through the numbers over and over again. I believe it's undervalued. I've looked at multiple DCFs. I think fair value is closer to 910 bucks. I've looked at the institutional volume. This thing is owned by 84% of the institutions. It does not make sense to me for why the institutions have been buying as much uh and for the stock to stay depressed. It had a billion shares of volume in September. I mean, I can go through a million different reasons, but no one's really going to care unless the stock goes up. And so, tomorrow, we get to see if the earnings are good enough for the stock to go up, which, look, here's my thing</p>

再次说明，关于 Grab 和 Nebius 的两篇深度分析已经发布。BMR 和 Duolingo 的文章也在 Substack 上。如果你还没读过，我真的很喜欢写作的过程。接下来的两篇深度分析可能是 Reddit 和 Iran。所以，我将花接下来两周时间研究它们，希望11月15日能发布。

<p class="english-text">Again, the two deep dives on Grab and Nebus are out. BMR and Dolingo are also on the substack. If you have not read those, I'm really liking the writing. I'm really liking it. Took me a lot of time. I think the next two deep dives are going to be Reddit and Iran. So, I'm spending the next two weeks on those and hopefully those are out November 15th.</p>
