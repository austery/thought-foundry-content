### 青少年精神病诊断率上升

**主持人**: 你有没有试过在床上辗转反侧，思绪万千，试图解决一个棘手的问题，然后醒来时答案就摆在眼前了？就像不知不觉中，你的大脑就想明白了，无需有意识的思考。这到底是怎么发生的？我们来看看科学界对那些构成梦境的素材有什么说法。我们仍然没有所有答案。这并不奇怪，因为大脑极其复杂。即使到现在，它的大部分仍然是科学家和哲学家们难以解开的谜团。但研究人员正在拼凑一些相当有趣的碎片，并提出新的一系列问题。例如，一项新的**安大略省**的研究发现，在过去几十年里，**14至20岁**人群中**精神病性障碍**的新诊断率增加了**60%**。我们将深入分析这些数据，以及它们可能意味着什么。欢迎收看《The Rundown》。

**Host**: Have you ever been tossing and turning in bed while your mind races trying to work out the solution to a tricky problem and then you wake up and the answer is just there? Like somehow while you were sleeping your brain figured it out, no conscious thought required. So how does that happen? We look at what science has to say about the stuff that dreams are made of. We still don't have all the answers. No surprise because the brain is incredibly complicated. And even now, much of it remains a mystery to scientists and philosophers alike. But researchers are putting together some pretty interesting pieces of the puzzle and raising new sets of questions. For example, a new Ontario-based study finds that rates of new diagnoses of psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia, increased by 60% in people aged 14 to 20 over the past few decades. We break down what the data shows and what it may mean. Welcome to the rundown.

</details>

**主持人**: 一项发表在《**加拿大医学协会杂志**》上的新研究称，在1997年至2023年间，**14至20岁**人群的**精神病性障碍**年发病率增加了**60%**。我与其中一位合著者进行了交流，以了解这些数字告诉我们什么，以及它们留下了哪些问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: A new study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal says that between 1997 and 2023, the annual incidence of psychotic disorders increased by 60% among people aged 14 to 20. I sat down with one of the co-authors to understand what the numbers are telling us and the questions they leave behind.

</details>

**主持人**: **保罗·库里亚克博士**是一位精神科医生和科学家，在**多伦多**的**成瘾与精神健康中心**工作，同时也是ICE（**成瘾与精神健康研究项目**）的高级科学家和负责人。他来到演播室。您好，医生？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Dr. Paul Kuriak is a psychiatrist and scientist at the Center for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto and a senior scientist and lead of the mental health and addictions research program at ICE and he joins us in studio. How are you sir?

</details>

**保罗·库里亚克博士**: 很好，谢谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Paul Kuriak**: Great. Thanks for having me.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。您的研究衡量了**安大略省**不同人群的精神病性障碍的发病率。当您退后一步审视这些发现时，最让您惊讶的是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. Your study measured the incidence of psychotic disorders across different groups in Ontario. When you stepped back and looked at the findings, what surprised you the most?

</details>

**保罗·库里亚克博士**: 嗯，我想，首先让我惊讶的是——我应该在开头说明，我是一名合著者——这项研究是由我在**渥太华大学**的同事**丹尼尔·迈因博士**领导的，他在这个项目上做得非常出色。当我们审视这些发现时，有几件事脱颖而出。一是发病率，也就是新诊断的个体比例，随着时间的推移在增加。二是，这种情况发生在越来越年轻的个体身上。第三点是诊断分类的方式。有不同类型的诊断属于我们所说的精神病性障碍，这是研究中一个比较细微的方面，但对我们来说是第三个有趣的点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Paul Kuriak**: Well, I think the the first thing that surprised me uh and I should say at the beginning that I was a co-author on this study um it was led by a colleague of mine at a University of Ottawa, Dr. Daniel Myin did a great job on this project. When we looked at the findings, the there are a couple things that struck out. one is that um that that the incidence which means the the rate of new newly diagnosed individuals is increasing over time. Uh it is happening in younger individuals over time. And then the third piece is the the the way that the diagnosis are breaking out. Uh, so there are different types of diagnoses that that are part of of what we call psychotic disorders and and that's a bit of a nuanced aspect of the study, but that was a third piece that was kind of interesting to us.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。那么，当我们说精神病性障碍时，我们指的是什么？我们有**精神分裂症**，也许是一个总称，然后我们还有精神分裂症和精神病。请帮助我们理解这些术语。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. Well, let's let's pick up on that. When you say psychotic disorders, what do we mean? We have schizophrenia in one room, an umbrella term perhaps, and then we have schizophrenia and we have psychosis. Help us understand uh sort of the terms there.

</details>

**保罗·库里亚克博士**: 是的。有精神分裂症和分裂情感性障碍，要被诊断为这些疾病，需要符合一定的标准。而这些诊断的发病率确实有所增加，但增幅不大。增加更多的叫做“**未特定的精神病**”（psychosis not otherwise specified）。这是一个诊断，像我这样的临床医生会在某人明显出现突出的精神病症状时使用，比如与现实脱节。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Paul Kuriak**: Yeah. So, so there's schizophrenia and schizopeeffective disorders and for people to be diagnosed with those uh conditions they they need to meet certain criteria and and that uh the the incident rate for those diagnoses did have increased a little bit but not that much. The the one that's increased more so is called psychosis not otherwise specified. And this is a diagnosis that clinicians like myself use when somebody is clearly presenting with prominent psychotic symptoms like a deviation from reality.

</details>

**主持人**: 抱歉，是幻觉？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Sorry, hallucinations,

</details>

**保罗·库里亚克博士**: 妄想。没错。而且，他们——但还有其他一些问题阻止我们直接断定是精神分裂症或分裂情感性障碍。所以，我们知道这个人有精神病，但可能还有其他因素最终导致了这种情况。比如，可能与**物质使用**有关，可能与**医学状况**有关，等等。所以，这有点像一个“保险”诊断。这绝对是一种精神病性障碍，而且这个诊断的大多数个体随着时间的推移确实会发展成精神分裂症的诊断。这只是表明，在初次诊断时，不确定这是否真的是精神分裂症。我不想过度简化，但可以说，正如您提到的，有一系列特定的症状，其中之一就是它是慢性的。精神分裂症是长期的，通常是六个月或更长。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Paul Kuriak**: delusions. Exactly. And uh but but they but there are other issues that prevent us from saying it is clearly schizophrenia and schizoeffective disorder. So, we know that the person's psychotic, but there could be other factors that that may ultimately be contributing to it. Um, like it could be related to substance use, it could be related to medical conditions, etc., etc. So, so it's kind of like a hedge diagnosis. It it is definitely a psychotic disorder and most individuals with this diagnosis do over time evolve to developing a diagnosis schizophrenia. just bel it it suggests a level of uncertainty that is truly schizophrenia at the time of first diagnosis. I don't want to simplify it but fair to say like you like you mentioned the specific set of symptoms one of them is it's chronic with schizophrenia that is long term that's about usually six months or more

</details>

**主持人**: 正确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: correct

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。我想看一张图表，来自这项研究。这张图显示了**精神分裂症谱系障碍**（深蓝色）、**未特定的精神病**（绿色）以及包括精神分裂症和精神病在内的**精神病性障碍**（黑色）的**发病率比率**。对于研究中的每个队列，这是与1975-1979年队列相比。对于精神病性障碍（黑线），从1985-1989年队列出生的人开始，诊断率逐渐增加。当研究人员分离数据时，显示精神分裂症的发生率略有上升，然后开始下降，但精神病的发生率却像滑雪坡一样增加。这说明了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: okay all right I want to look at a graph uh from this study this graph shows the incidence rate ratios for schizophrenia spectrum disorder which is in the dark blue color psychosis not otherwise specified in green and psychotic disorders which include both schizophrenia and psychosis in black. Now, for each cohort studied, this is comparing to the 1975 1979 cohort. For psychotic disorders, the black line, there is a gradual increase in the rate of diagnosis starting with those born in the 198589 cohort. When researchers separated the data, it showed that the rate of schizophrenia goes up slightly, but then starts to go down, but the rate of psychosis increases kind of like a ski hill. What is this telling us?

</details>

**保罗·库里亚克博士**: 是的。所以，如果我们回到“未特定的精神病”和真正是“精神分裂症谱系障碍”之间的区别。嗯，是那个——那个市场增长——在那个稍微不确定的类别中，即“未特定的精神病”，这意味着在初次诊断时，不确定这是否真的是精神分裂症。这意味着随着时间的推移，诊断的复杂性正在增加。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Paul Kuriak**: Yes. So, so if we return to the difference between psychosis not otherwise specified and and uh the something that is like truly a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Uh it is the the the market increase in in the sort of the slightly uncertain category. the psychosis not otherwise specified which means that uh at the time of first diagnosis there is is less certainty that this is truly schizophrenia which means that there are there's complexities in in in the diagnosis over time that is increasing the most

</details>

**主持人**: 有很多关于原因的头条新闻。这项研究并没有关注原因，但请帮助我们理解，有哪些联系被提出来了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: a lot of headlines in terms of what is causing it this study was not looking at what was causing this uh but help us understand what what are what are some links that have been sort of made

</details>

**保罗·库里亚克博士**: 是的。所以，我认为，首先重要的一点是，这项研究在设计上非常出色，能够描述发病率随时间的变化。这项研究本身并没有帮助我们理解为什么会出现我们所观察到的现象。所以，当我想到这些联系时，实际上是在推断这项研究之外的证据。但我想说的是，我们普遍观察到，在年轻人——通常是16至35岁的个体——中，他们比前几代人受到的污名化少得多，并且更倾向于寻求帮助。这可能部分解释了为什么我们看到更多（的诊断）发生在更年轻的群体中。另一个因素是，随着时间的推移，省内**早期精神病干预项目**的实施更加有力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Paul Kuriak**: yeah so I think the the The first important point is that this study was very well designed to characterize changes in rates over time. There's nothing about this particular study that helps us understand why we're observing what we're observing. So when I think about the links, it's really like extrapolating to evidence beyond this study. Um but I would say uh what we are observing generally amongst young people and these are 16 to 35 year old individuals typically uh what we're observing amongst young people is they are far less stigmatized than previous generations and much more inclined to seek help. So that may partly explain why we're seeing more and younger. Um the other factor is that uh over time there has been more robust um implementation of early psychosis intervention programs proincially.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Okay.

</details>

**保罗·库里亚克博士**: 所以，当你向一个省提供更多服务时，往往会吸引更多的病例。然后，第三点也是令人担忧的是，**大麻合法化**的时期，**未特定精神病**这种不太确定的诊断的上升幅度非常大。大麻合法化伴随着年轻人接触到**高浓度大麻**，而这项研究之外的证据表明，这会对精神病的发生构成严重风险。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Paul Kuriak**: So anytime you put more services into a province it that there's a tendency to pull in more more cases. And then the third piece that that actually is the cause for concern is is the um is the fact that the rise in the less certain diagnosis than not otherwise specified is is occurring dramatically at a time of uh cannabis legalization. And and what comes with cannabis legalization is the young people are exposed with high potency uh cannabis which uh evidence outside of this study suggests does pose a serious risk for the onset of psychosis.

</details>

**主持人**: 大麻，高浓度还是不？嗯，我们谈论的是年轻人的大脑。我们谈论的是他们大约25岁之前仍在发育的大脑。这对大脑有什么影响？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: What does cannabis high high potency or not? Uh these are young brains that we're talking about. We're talking um you know when they're still developing up until about the age of 25. But what what does it do to the brain?

</details>

**保罗·库里亚克博士**: 是的。有很多原因。目前还不完全清楚，但似乎有越来越多的证据表明，大麻中的**THC化学物质**会与大脑中的某些受体结合，从而导致一种生物学上的精神病倾向。所以，我的看法是——而且有很多比我更专业的人——我认为，如果你有发展精神病性障碍的易感性，接触高浓度大麻可能会增加你患精神病性障碍的可能性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Paul Kuriak**: Yeah. So, so there's lot So, it's not entirely clear, but that does seem to uh like there's a there's a aggregation of evidence that suggests that there's something about uh the THC chemical in cannabis that binds with certain receptors in the brain that causes a biological inclination to become psychotic. So the way I think about it and there are there are people who are more better experts than me on this is I think like if you are vulnerable to developing a psychotic disorder, exposure to high potency cannabis may increase your likelihood to develop a psychotic disorder.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。嗯，男性和女性之间有区别吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Okay. Um is there a difference between uh men and women?

</details>

**保罗·库里亚克博士**: 男性和女性在精神分裂症的发病方面一直存在基线差异。男性患精神病的年龄更小。他们往往因此疾病而导致更严重的残疾。男性与女性的比例在男性中略高。当然，就大麻风险因素而言，以及服务利用率而言，年轻男性在接受医疗保健方面出了名地困难。而且他们比女性更可能滥用药物。我们谈到了2018年的合法化。看看这些数据，当然这只是开始，这是正确的决定吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Paul Kuriak**: There's there's been a a baseline difference in men and women in the onset of of schizophrenia. So men develop it uh psychosis at a younger age. They tend to be more disabled as a result of the condition. Uh the ratio of men to women is a little higher in men. And of course uh as it relates to the cannabis risk factor uh and actually to the service utilization. Men, young men are notoriously difficult to engage in healthcare. Uh and they are much more likely to consume substances than women. uh we talked about legalization of course 2018 um looking at this data and of course this is just just the beginning here was that the right call

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，这是一个重要的问题。政策本质上是一种妥协。我认为，2018年的合法化是为了回应几个重要问题。一是，如果你在多伦多走走，很明显公众有休闲**娱乐性大麻**的需求。我是说，这就是人们想要的，所以政策通常会遵循人们的意愿。我也认为，这一点非常重要，当大麻非法时，其非法化的后果——因持有而被监禁——并非公平地发生。我们知道，边缘化群体更有可能被监禁，并因此承担所有负面后果，比如留下犯罪记录等等。所以，这是制定政策的一个非常好的、合法的理由。但现在，随着越来越多的证据出现——这就是我们想要做的，对吧？监测政策的意外后果。那么现在我们该怎么办？对我来说，就像，嗯，**烟草**可能比**酒精**是更好的例子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: yeah so so uh it's it's an important question um the policy is inherently a compromise and I think that the the legalization issue in 2018 responded to a couple of important issues one is that that I mean, if you walk around Toronto, there's clearly a a public interest in having ready access to marijuana recreationally. I mean, that that is just what what people want and so policy follows what what people want typically. I also think, and this is a really important piece, is that um when cannabis was illegal, uh the the consequences of it being illegal, incarceration for possession did not happen equitably. and that we know we knew and that more marginalized individuals were more likely to be incarcerated and have all the negative consequences of having a criminal record etc.

</details>

**保罗·库里亚克博士**: 烟草是一种合法物质，但受到高度管制和高税收。所以，我认为有政策解决方案可以找到这种妥协或平衡，即在维持政策最初制定的益处的同时，解决我们正在了解的一些风险。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Paul Kuriak**: Tobacco is a legal substance, but it's pretty highly regulated and highly taxed. So, you know, I think there are policy solutions to to find that compromise or balance between, you know, maintaining the benefits for which the policy was first enacted at the same time address some of the risks that we're learning about.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。接受这种诊断对很多人来说可能很可怕。您能解释一下这种诊断对个人或他们身边的人来说是如何具有挑战性的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. receiving this kind of diagnosis uh can be frightening for many. Um could you explain how this diagnosis is challenging for the indivi dual or for those who are in their lives as well?

</details>

**保罗·库里亚克博士**: 哦，这……你知道，我的临床工作是在**CAMH**的急诊科。这是那种让你真正为患者感到难受的情况之一。它如何表现出来？通常，它是一种缓慢发展的、与现实脱节的状况，同时也是一种缓慢发展的社交退缩。比如，一个高中男生，曾经完全融入社交，参与一切活动，然后开始退缩，开始回避学校，不愿去学校，家人开始注意到他可能在自言自语，有时会不恰当地发笑。这就是它的表现方式。而且，个体能够早期获得护理是极其重要的，因为我们知道，一个人未经治疗的时间越长，预后就越差。如果我们能让人们早期得到治疗，我们就能真正改变一个年轻人的生活轨迹。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Paul Kuriak**: Oh, this is you know my my clinical work is in the CAMH emergency department and this is this is one of those ones where you uh you really feel for the individual. Uh so how it manifests um it typically it is a it often a slowly evolving sort of uh deviation from reality and also often uh a slowly evolving uh social withdrawal that that uh so a young man uh in high school like totally social engaged in everything starts to withdraw from stuff then starts like like avoiding school, reluctant to avoid school, family starts noticing that that he might be sort of talking to himself, laughing inappropriately at times. Um, so that's kind of how it it it manifests. Um, and and it's incredibly important that individuals uh have access to care early because we know that the longer an individual goes untreated, the worse the prognosis uh is. like like if we can get people into care early the we can really change the trajectory of a young person's life.

</details>

**主持人**: 我想我知道答案，但是否有足够的**支持**来帮助那些寻求治疗的人？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I think I know the answer to this but are there enough supports uh in place for those seeking treatment?

</details>

**保罗·库里亚克博士**: 嗯，我想说的是，在我们省，我们知道我们没有足够的**心理健康服务**来帮助那些普遍患有精神疾病的人。在这种情况下，与其他心理健康系统领域相比，我们确实有一个强大的**早期精神病干预项目**体系。但我的研究团队的证据表明，尽管这个省级网络存在，但并非所有患有该疾病的人都能或确实能够获得这些服务。其中一些与资源不足有关，一些与**意识**有关。例如，如果你是由精神科医生诊断或在医院环境中诊断，你被转介到这些项目之一的可能性要大得多，而不是如果你在初级保健中得到管理。这可能只是一个意识问题。而且，这是一个大问题，因为我们知道，除了长时间得不到治疗之外，这是一种致命的疾病。你知道，在医院被诊断的16至35岁的年轻人中，有**25分之一**的人在5年内死亡。如果在门诊环境中诊断，则有**40分之一**。没有人应该在16至35岁之间死亡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Paul Kuriak**: So uh I would say that um throughout our province we know that we don't have enough services uh for individuals struggling with mental illnesses generally. In this case, we do have a in comparison to other areas of our mental health system, we do have a robust system of early psychosis intervention programs that currently exist. Um, but evidence that has come out of uh my research team suggests that even though this provincial network exists, um not not everybody with the disorder can can can or does access them. And and some of that has to do with inadequacy of resources. Some of it has to do with awareness. And so, for example, if you're diagnosed by a psychiatrist or diagnosed in a hospital setting, you're much more likely to be referred to one of these programs, excuse me, than if you were managed in primary care. And that's probably just an awareness situation. Um and and the the that's a big problem because uh what we know about the consequences in addition to like you know longer periods of no treatment uh this is a deadly illness that that um you know people who are diagnosed in a hospital these are 16 to 35 year olds uh one in 25 die within 5 years. If you're diagnosed in outpatient setting one in 40 nobody should be dying between the ages of 16 and 35. And

</details>

**主持人**: 他们是怎么死的？最常见的原因是**自杀**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: how do they how do they die? The most common cause is suicide.

</details>

**保罗·库里亚克博士**: 是的。自杀率非常高，这很合理，因为这些年轻人有自己的身份认同和人生规划，而这个诊断彻底颠覆了他们的一切。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Paul Kuriak**: Yeah. The suicide rate is is incredibly high and and it just makes sense because these are young people who have a sense of who they are and what they're going to be doing in their life and their whole identity gets rocked by this diagnosis.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。医生，我们就谈到这里，但非常感谢您的见解。谢谢您。当然，随着这项研究的深入，未来还会出现更多的研究和政策。我们期待着。非常感谢您。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. Uh doctor, we're going to have to leave it there, but really appreciate your insights. Uh thank you for this and of course um with this there will be more things to come out of this in terms of uh research and studies and policy. So, we look forward to that and uh thank you so much.

</details>

**保罗·库里亚克博士**: 非常感谢您邀请我。

### 梦境的科学

**主持人**: 当**凯伦·范坎彭**还是个孩子的时候，她经常在她父亲的实验室里玩耍，那是**北美**最早的独立睡眠实验室之一。现在，这位健康与科学记者将她对睡眠、梦境以及介于两者之间的一切的终生兴趣，转化为一本新书——《**大脑从不沉睡：我们为何做梦，以及它对健康意味着什么**》。凯伦·范坎彭是一位健康与科学记者。你好吗，凯伦？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: When Karen Ben Campin was a child, she hung out at her father's lab, one of the first independent sleep labs in North America. Now, the health and science journalist has turned her lifelong interest in sleep, dreams, and everything in between into a new book called The Brain Never Sleeps: Why We Dream, and What It Means for Our Health. Karen Vancampen is a health and science journalist. How are you doing Karen?

</details>

**凯伦·范坎彭**: 我很好，你呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Vancampen**: I'm well. How are you?

</details>

**主持人**: 我也很好。我们来聊聊。梦境非常复杂，包含情感和视觉元素。请帮助我们理解，大脑的哪些部分与做梦有关？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I am doing well. Let's talk. Dreams are quite complex. There's emotions. There's visual components to help us understand what parts of the brain are affiliated with dreaming.

</details>

**凯伦·范坎彭**: 大脑的不同部分在睡眠周期的不同时间是活跃的。大脑中在做梦时活跃的部分是你的大脑的**情绪中心**。所以，帮助处理情感、与我们的感受有关的大脑部分。在**REM睡眠**期间，**前额叶皮层**的活跃度比清醒时低。而那是真正负责做决定、理性思考的部分，在REM睡眠期间活跃度较低。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Vancampen**: So, different parts of the brain are active at different times in the sleep cycle. Um, one part of the brain that's active during dreaming is the emotional center of your brain. So, um the parts of the brain that help process emotions that um are involved in our feelings, uh the preffrontal cortex, uh during REM sleep, it's less active than when we're awake. And that's the part of the brain that really deals with making decisions, thinking rationally, and that's less active during REM.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。你提到了REM和周期。所以，REM简单来说就是**快速眼动**，然后是非快速眼动。你提到了我们做梦的周期。我们怎么知道你所知道的呢？有眼球运动，这很清楚，但我们怎么知道那就是我们做梦的地方？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. You mentioned REM and you mentioned cycle. So, REM to simplify rapid eye movement, and then there is non-rapid eye movement. Um you mentioned which cycles we dream in. How do we know what you know there there's eye movement that's very clear in when we talk about but how do we know that's where we dream?

</details>

**凯伦·范坎彭**: 我们通过非REM和REM睡眠做梦。非REM睡眠是第一到第三阶段。第一、第二和第三阶段是非REM睡眠。REM睡眠是第四阶段。所以我们实际上整晚都在睡眠周期中做梦。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Vancampen**: So we dream um through nonrem and REM. So nonREM sleep is stages one through three. Stages 1, two, and three is nonrem sleep. And REM sleep is stage four. So we actually dream all through the sleep cycle all through the night. Um so that's

</details>

**主持人**: 最生动、最强烈的梦境发生在哪个阶段？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: where are the best most vivid dreams?

</details>

**凯伦·范坎彭**: REM睡眠。通常我们最强烈、最生动、最情绪化的梦境发生在REM睡眠期间，而我们第一次进入REM睡眠大约在入睡90分钟后。我们每晚会经历四个或五个睡眠周期。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Vancampen**: REM sleep. So, it's typically our most intense, vivid, emotional dreams happen during REM and we get to our first REM. We go through four or five stages of the sleep cycle a night, right? And um so we get it's about 90 minutes into the sleep cycle that we have our first period of REM.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。读你的书，我发现你的童年相当不寻常，就你所经历的而言。是什么让你想更多地了解睡眠和梦境？我知道你父亲在这方面起了很大作用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Okay. Uh reading your book, you have I would say quite an unusual childhood in terms of what you were what you experienced. what drew you to understand more about sleep and dreams and I know your father had a lot to do with that.

</details>

**凯伦·范坎彭**: 我父亲是一位睡眠医生，所以我一直沉浸在睡眠的世界里。我把它看作是睡眠通往梦境世界的门户。我从小就一直思考睡眠，努力获得足够的睡眠。睡眠是我成长过程中非常重要的一部分。几年前，我读了一项科学研究，说我们睡眠不足的程度和做梦的程度一样。这让我思考，为什么梦境本身很重要，而不仅仅是睡眠？睡眠本身就是一个产业，我们非常关注睡眠，但梦境呢？然后这引起了我对梦境科学的兴趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Vancampen**: So my dad's a sleep doctor, so I was always immersed in this world of sleep. And I sort of look at it as sleep was kind of like this gateway to the world of dreams. And so I was always, you know, always thinking about sleep and trying to get enough sleep. And sleep was a really big part of growing up um my childhood. And then a few years ago, I read this uh scientific study that said we're as dreamd as we are sleepd deprived. And it's it made me think, you know, why do dreams matter on their own in, you know, not just sleep? Sleep is its own industry and we're very focused on sleep, but what about dreams? And then it got me it turned me on to uh the science of dreaming

</details>

**主持人**: 正如你提到的，以及我们谈到的关于大脑的，我们在理解大脑方面已经走了很远。是的。我们对梦境的理解更好了吗？我知道这个问题——我们为什么会做梦——已经被问了几十年了。但我们对这个问题有更好的理解吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: as you mentioned and what we've talked about in terms of the brain. We have come a long way in terms of understanding the brain. Yes. Uh do we better understand dreams? I know this is a question of why do we dream has been asked for decades. uh but do we have a better understanding of that?

</details>

**凯伦·范坎彭**: 有很多关于我们为什么做梦的可能性。一种观点是，我们做梦是为了帮助——梦境睡眠和梦境有助于**巩固记忆**。比如，我们在白天学到了新东西，或者有了新体验。人们认为，在睡眠和梦境中，它有助于加强这些记忆。所以，这是第一点：记忆巩固。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Vancampen**: So there's many possibilities of why we dream. So one idea is that we dream to help uh dream sleep and dreams help consolidate memories. Okay. So let's say we've learned something uh new during the day or we've had a new experience. It's thought that uh during sleep and during dreams it helps to strengthen these memories. So that's one thing is memory consolidation. Um,

</details>

**主持人**: 所以，就像一个你可以放进去的梦境储藏室？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: so a cabinet of of dreams that you can put in and

</details>

**凯伦·范坎彭**: 正是如此。而且，这真的很棒。所以，一种想法是，它被称为——它被称为“**下一站模型**”（next up model）的梦境。我发现这很迷人，因为我一直想知道，为什么我突然会梦到童年或多年前的事情？为什么我今晚会选择梦到它？这是什么？这个想法是，为了巩固记忆，比如最近的经历、最近的记忆，你会将它与大脑中已存储的记忆库中的记忆联系起来。所以，它通过这些联系、这些独特的联系来寻找可能性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Vancampen**: Exactly. So, and then uh it's really neat. Um, so one idea is it's called this ne it's called the next up model of dreaming. Okay. And I found this fascinating because I've always wondered, you know, why do I suddenly dream of something from my childhood or years ago? Why do I do I choose to say dream of it tonight? What what is it? And this idea is that in order to strengthen memories, say recent experiences, recent memories, you associate it with with memories from your catalog of memories that are already stored in your brain. So that's it's finding possibilities through these connections, these unique and um yeah, unique connections through these associations.

</details>

**主持人**: 另一种理论是将梦境视为一种“**夜间疗法**”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Uh another theory is sort of viewing dreams as sort of a night therapy.

</details>

**凯伦·范坎彭**: 给我讲讲，这很有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Vancampen**: Walk me through that. That's interesting.

</details>

**凯伦·范坎彭**: 非常有趣。嗯，是的。**马修·沃克**（Matthew Walker）——他的观点是梦境作为夜间疗法，以及其他梦境研究人员也研究过这一点——其核心思想是，它有助于**处理我们的情绪**。所以，它有助于我们接受，比如说，困难的情绪。**罗丝琳·卡特赖特**（Rosalind Cartwright）被称为“梦境女王”，她对经历**离婚**的人进行了研究，发现如果做关于离婚的令人不安的梦，一年后他们的应对能力会更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Vancampen**: It's so interesting. So um Yep. So Matthew Walker he uh so it's dreams as overnight therapy and the whole idea um about dreams as overnight therapy and other uh dream researchers have have also studied this is that it helps to process our emotions. So um it helps come to terms with say difficult emotions. Um Roslin Cartwright, she was known as the queen of dreams and she did these studies on people who were going through divorce and she found out if you dream you have these unsettling dreams about your divorce you actually they the subjects tended to cope better a year later.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以，这也意味着它有助于处理情绪，但保留记忆的细节。还有一种想法是，我们做梦。有些人可能认为，当我们清醒时和入睡时，梦境是两个独立的部分。但当我们醒来时，有时我们可能会解决了我们处理过的一些问题。请帮助我们理解梦境如何在我们醒来后帮助我们应对现实世界。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So that is also so it's it helps to um process the emotions but keep the details of the memory. There's also this thinking of our dreams. Some people may look look at them as two separate compartments when we're awake and we're falling asleep. But when we wake up sometimes we might have solved some of the issues that we dealt with. Help us understand perhaps how dreams kind of help us when we wake up in our real world.

</details>

**凯伦·范坎彭**: 有一种观点认为，当我们入睡时，我们会标记某些想法，以便在夜间晚些时候重新审视。比如，你正在思考一个问题，试图解决它。当你入睡时，你可能会思考它。所以在**睡眠开始**时，这是一个非常独特的时刻。它几乎就像一次梦幻般的头脑风暴会议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Vancampen**: So it's thought that when we're falling asleep, we sort of tag certain ideas to revisit later in the night. So let's say you're you're trying to, you know, you're noodling around. When you're thinking about a problem you're trying to solve, you might be thinking about it as you're falling asleep. So during sleep onset, it's this really unique time. It's almost like a dreamy brainstorming session.

</details>

**主持人**: 我本来要说，这就像一个待办事项清单，是另一个待办事项清单。对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I was going to say it's like a to-do list for it's another to-do list. All right.

</details>

**凯伦·范坎彭**: 正是如此。你可以，如果你想解决一个问题，或者想一个有创意的想法，当你入睡时，你可以思考这个想法，思考你想处理的这个问题，然后通常它会帮助引导你的梦境。所以，你正在思考的那些想法。**梦境工程**（dream engineering）利用技术来帮助你引导和塑造你的梦境。我做了一个梦境实验，非常有趣。基本上，**亚当·哈尔**（Adam Har）是一位梦境研究者，他帮我在家设置了这个临时的梦境实验。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Vancampen**: Exactly. So you can like if you you can even guide your dream thoughts. That's about dream engineering. Okay. And so let's say you want to work on a problem, you want to solve a problem or you want to think about a new creative idea. when you're falling asleep, you can think about this idea, think about this problem that you want to work on and then often times it will help guide your dreams. So those thoughts that you're thinking about and dream engineering um uses technology to um help you guide and shape your dreams. So I did this dream experiment and it was really fun. And so basically I um Adam Har he's a dream researcher and he helped me set it up this sort of ad hoc dream experiment at home

</details>

**主持人**: 然后，当我刚入睡时，睡眠开始的最初几分钟……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: and so as I was just falling asleep in sleep onset the first few minutes of sleep

</details>

**凯伦·范坎彭**: 嗯，我之前录制了一个录音，然后录音播放了，它说的是我的声音，并说“记住要想想一棵树”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Vancampen**: um a recording I did a recording before and then it would the recording played and it said it was my voice and it said remember to think of a tree.

</details>

**主持人**: 啊。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Ah

</details>

**凯伦·范坎彭**: 然后，它就帮助引导了我的梦境。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Vancampen**: and then so then that was help guide my my dreams.

</details>

**主持人**: 然后你梦到了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And what did you dream then?

</details>

**凯伦·范坎彭**: 我梦到了各种各样的树。起初它非常具体。我梦见了一棵柳树，就在我们家以前的那个小屋前面。然后，随着我进入睡眠状态，它开始变得更具创造性，不那么具体，也不那么合乎逻辑。然后我想到了我和我丈夫在树林里迷路的那段时间。然后树变成了波浪，变得非常抽象。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Vancampen**: I dreamt about all these different trees. First it was very concrete. Okay. And I was dreaming of there was this willow tree um in front of this cabin where um our family used to have this cabin. And then it started to get the farther I went into sleep onset, it started getting more creative and um not as concrete and not as logical. Okay. And then I thought of uh this time that my husband and I got lost in these woods and then the the trees became waves and so it got very abstract almost.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。说到抽象，让我们谈谈**清醒梦**。我敢肯定有很多听众可能做过这样的梦：他们正在奔跑，突然意识到，“等等，我正在做梦。我知道我正在做梦，然后可能会停下来。”请向我们解释一下清醒梦。你能告诉我们关于它们什么？为什么我们会有控制权？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. Um speaking of abstract, let's talk about lucid dreams there. I'm sure there are many listeners who have probably had a dream where they're running and then all of a sudden they're like, "Hold on, I am dreaming. I know I'm dreaming and probably stop." Um explain to us about lucid dreams. What can you tell us about them? Why do we have control?

</details>

**凯伦·范坎彭**: 清醒梦是指在梦境发生时，你开始意识到自己身处梦境。就是拥有这种意识，然后一旦获得意识，就能发展这项技能，真正学会你的梦境是你想象力的创造。所以你实际上可以掌控它。然后你开始控制你的梦境角色，或者情节。你可以选择你想做什么，你一直想做什么。有些人想尝试飞行。我读到过，我和一个梦境研究者谈过，他说有一位艺术家，他想象一个艺术画廊。他打开门走进这个艺术画廊，里面有所有美丽的画作，它们是他自己想象力和心灵的创造。然后他醒来，画出他梦到的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Vancampen**: So lucid dreaming is when it starts with to be aware that you're in a dream as the dream is happening. So it's to have that awareness and then once you gain the awareness, it's to develop that skill to actually learn that you your dream is a it's a creation of your imagination. So you actually can be in control. So then you start to control your dream characters or maybe the plot. You could choose, you know, what to do, what you've always wanted to do. Some people want to try and fly. Um I read about I talked to a dream researcher and he told me there's an artist and he imagines um an art gallery.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Okay.

</details>

**凯伦·范坎彭**: 他打开门，走进这个艺术画廊，里面有所有美丽的画作，它们是他自己想象力和心灵的创造。然后他醒来，画出他梦到的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Vancampen**: And he opens the door and goes into this art gallery and there's all these beautiful paintings and they're a creation of his own his own imagination and mind. Okay. So then he wakes up and and sketches out what he was dreaming.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。我觉得这里有很多力量可以被利用，如果我们能真正弄清楚的话。另一方面，你的书里提到了“**梦境广告**”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. I I'm going to I feel like there's a lot of uh a lot of power to harness here if we can really sort of figure it out. On the flip side, there's something that you talk about in your book called dream advertising.

</details>

**凯伦·范坎彭**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Vancampen**: Yes.

</details>

**主持人**: 帮助我们理解那是什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Help us understand what that is.

</details>

**凯伦·范坎彭**: 这个问题几年前被提出来了。基本上，我们在睡眠时更容易受到影响。所以问题是，如果我们有一个扬声器在我们卧室里，它是否能——如果我们容易受到想法和想法的影响，那么公司是否可以——你知道，在我们在睡觉时推广他们的产品？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Vancampen**: So it was brought up a few years ago and so basically we are more there we are vulnerable when we're sleeping and so the question was brought up let's say if we have um a speaker in our in our bedroom and it could you know if we're susceptible to ideas and thoughts could it then could we be um influenced say if a company wanted to um you know say push their product while we were sleeping.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，这就是它的含义。那么，这是可能的吗？这是可行的吗？这些都是技术上来说，如果我们容易受到暗示，在睡眠周期的某些时候，但它真的可能改变我们的购买和消费习惯吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. So that's kind of what it is. So, you know, the is it is it probable? Is it possible? These are sort of, you know, things where technically if we're susceptible to suggestion at certain times of the sleep sleep cycle, but is it really probable that this will change our say buying and consumer habits?

</details>

**凯伦·范坎彭**: 我认为梦境非常强大。我是说，这让我想到，我们一生中有三分之一的时间在睡眠中度过，而其中很大一部分时间在做梦。我们拥有一个精神生活，我们可以利用它来引导我们的梦境以获得创造力，解决问题，然后在早晨利用我们的梦境来更好地理解我们的担忧或顾虑，是什么在困扰着我们的思绪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Vancampen**: I think that dreams are so powerful. I mean it's it makes me think you know we spend a third of our lives asleep and a large portion of that time dreaming and there's this whole this mental life that we have there that we can tap into to try and you know guide our dreams for creativity to solve problems and then in the morning use our dreams to better understand say our preoccupations or our concerns what's sort of weighing on our minds.

</details>

**主持人**: 在制作这本书的过程中，你深入研究了许多研究。我很好奇，有没有一项研究让你觉得“哇，这太神奇了，关于我们的大脑在梦境方面的运作方式。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: During the production of this book, uh you have delved into a number of studies. I am curious what's one that kind of left you sitting back and being like that is like amazing to think how our brain works when it comes to dreams.

</details>

**凯伦·范坎彭**: 我研究过梦境，也研究过**麻醉梦**。**斯坦福大学**有一组研究人员，他们发现如果让病人保持在一种特定的脑状态下，即低于意识水平，他们会进入一种平静、放松的状态。这很棒，因为你可以重温可能困难甚至创伤性的经历和事件，但处于一种平静的状态。所以，你可以重温它们，然后几乎创造出关于它们的新的记忆。我与有过这些经历的人交谈过，他们说这些经历是**改变人生的**，是**转折性的**。所以，这简直令人难以置信。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Vancampen**: So the the work that I was so so dreaming for sure that I talked about and then also anesthesia dreams. So, it's a group of researchers at Stanford and they've discovered that if you keep a patient at a certain brain state just under the level of consciousness, they come to this calm, relaxed state. And it's wonderful because you can revisit potentially difficult and even traumatic experiences and events, but having this calm state. So, you're able to revisit them and then almost create new memories of them. And so, I spoke with people who had these experiences as well and they said they were lifealtering, transforming. So, um it's it's unbelievable actually.

</details>

**主持人**: 潜力巨大。是的，那里有太多东西了。我无法想象你的床头柜是什么样子，但我猜可能有一本书和一支笔。是的。我必须承认，在这个访谈之前，这个周末我一直在努力回忆我的梦。因为很多人分享梦境时，他们想要一些象征意义的解读。嗯，你认为我们如何充分利用我们的梦境？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: The potential is the potential. Yeah, there's so much there. Um, I can't imagine what's what your bedside table looks like, but I imagine there's probably a book and a pen there. Yes. Um, I will admit before this interview this weekend, I was trying to remember my dreams, right? Uh, because lots of people when they share dreams, they want some interpretation of the symbols. Um, what do you how do we take full advantage of our dreams?

</details>

**凯伦·范坎彭**: 我一直认为我们是自己梦境的最佳解读者。所以，我们如何挖掘它们，深入研究它们，以不同的方式看待它们。你知道，我们知道，比如有一个特定的主题，甚至一个人反复出现。我的看法是，就像我们的梦境在说，“嘿，多关注这个想法，或者也许是这个人。”这是你可以做的事情。我参加过一个**梦境沙龙**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Vancampen**: So, I always think we're the best interpreter of our own dreams. So we it's how we want to tap into them, delve into them, look at them differently. Um, you know, we know if let's say there's a certain theme or even a person keeps showing up. The way I look at it is it's like our dreams are saying, you know, pay more attention to this idea or maybe this person. That's something um that you can do. I did um a dream salon.

</details>

**主持人**: 我读过这个。是的。好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I did read about this. Yes. Okay.

</details>

**凯伦·范坎彭**: 那太有趣了。我以前从未分享过梦境，所以是和一群朋友以及梦境研究者一起。这太有趣了，因为我分享了一个梦，而其他人从不同的角度看待它。如果你分享你的梦，然后不同的人说，“如果这是我的梦，我可能会这样想”，这完全改变了我对梦境的看法。然后，你可以从别人的角度来看待它，看看什么对你有效。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Vancampen**: So it was so interesting. I've never shared a dream before and so it was with a group of friends and dream researchers and um it was so interesting because I shared a dream and the perspectives that other people had on so you you share your dream and then different people say you know if it was my dream I would maybe think about this and it totally changed my perspective on my dreams and then you know you can you can look at it from other people's perspectives and and see what works for you

</details>

**主持人**: 非常迷人，令人兴奋。这是一本非常精彩的书。正如我们所谈到的，有很多潜力。凯伦，非常感谢您。真的很感激。
