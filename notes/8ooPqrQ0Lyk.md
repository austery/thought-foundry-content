title: 多伦多警队腐败案规模有多大？
summary: 多伦多星报记者詹妮弗·帕廖拉深入报道了多伦多警队的一起大规模腐败案件。案件涉及七名现役警官和一名退休警官，指控包括贩毒、受贿、泄露警方数据库信息、协助保险欺诈、安装GPS追踪器骚扰他人，甚至阴谋谋杀。部分行为已导致严重犯罪，如针对狱警的谋杀阴谋和枪击事件。此案与多伦多的“拖车大战”有所关联，并引发了对警队监督、信息安全及公众信任的广泛担忧。安大略省警务监察处已启动审查。案件规模之大、性质之严重，被认为是多伦多警队历史上的“前所未有”。

### 追踪器与欺诈

**主持人**: 詹妮弗·帕廖拉是《多伦多星报》的犯罪记者，她一直在密切关注此案。她现在在演播室。你好吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Jennifer Pagliaro is the Toronto Star's crime reporter and has been following this story closely. And she joins me in studio. How are you doing?

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕廖拉**: 很好。非常感谢邀请我。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: Good. Thanks so much for having me.

</details>

**主持人**: 这里有很多需要揭露的。我们正在了解更多关于涉案警官和平民的信息。请给我们最新进展。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: There is a lot to uncover here. We are learning a bit more about the officers and the civilians involved. Give us the latest.

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕廖拉**: 我们刚报道称，一些警官涉及了更详细的指控。警方称，其中一名警官与一名同样被指控为该项目一部分的平民有关联，帮助她指导如何在一辆另一名妇女的车上安装 **GPS追踪器**。据称，这损坏了她的车，而且这名妇女在使用追踪器被跟踪时也感到被骚扰。最终，警方表示她担心自己的安全。现在，一名 **多伦多警官** 与一名平民一起被指控犯有此项指控，我认为这让很多人感到震惊。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: So we just reported that some of the officers were involved in a little bit more detailed allegations from the police that they, one of them was involved with a civilian who's also charged as part of this project, helping advise her on how to install a GPS tracker on another woman's car. It allegedly damaged her car, and that woman also felt harassed when she was followed using this tracker. And ultimately, police say she feared for her safety. Now, a Toronto police officer is charged jointly with a civilian in that allegation, which is, I think, shocking to a lot of people.

</details>

**主持人**: 我……如果我没记错的话，是不是还发现了一把枪？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And I'm. Correct me if I'm wrong. Was there a gun also found as well?

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕廖拉**: 是的。这名平民拥有一把非常老式的 **枪**，据称她将其存放在住所一个上锁的抽屉里，放在一个信封里，她因此被指控疏忽储存。我们不确定她是如何得到枪的。如果警官以任何方式帮助了她，他并没有因此被指控，但这当然仍然令人担忧。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: Yes. The civilian had a very old model gun that she was allegedly keeping in a unlocked drawer inside of an envelope in her residence, which she was charged with carelessly storing. We're not sure how she got the gun. If the officer participated in helping her in any way. He's not charged with that, but of course, concerning nonetheless.

</details>

**主持人**: 还有另一名警官，似乎与 **保险欺诈** 或与汽车有关。我们知道些什么？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And there was another officer, something closely related to insurance fraud or something with a car. What do we know?

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕廖拉**: 是的，有一名警官据称向他的一名同伙出谋划策，如何帮助偷走那辆车，以便那个人能够骗取被盗汽车的非法保险赔偿，这本质上是一个设局。我们知道，在法庭记录中出现名字的那个人，我们也知道他是 **皮尔地区警官** 之一，他已被停职但未被刑事起诉。没有人证实他们是同一个人。但当然，这个名字现在已经出现在法庭记录上，而那个人据称从未实施过盗窃保险欺诈的计划。所以那个人没有被刑事起诉。但涉案警官，**罗伯特·布莱克警督**，被指控教唆他进行保险欺诈。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: Yeah, there's an officer who allegedly counselled one of his associates on how he could help have that car stolen so that that person could claim an illegal insurance fraud on the stolen car, which would have been a setup, essentially. We know that the person whose name is on that court record, that name is also known to us as being one of the Peel Region police officers who is suspended but not criminally charged. No one would confirm that they're the same person. But of course, that name has popped up now on the court record, and that person allegedly never went through with the stealing insurance fraud scheme. And so that's why that person's not criminally charged. But the officer involved, Sergeant Robert Black, is charged with counselling him on how to commit insurance fraud.

</details>

### 警官指控

**主持人**: 好的。我们刚才评论说，感觉这就像一个洋葱，我们一层层地剥开。事情很多。我想退一步，确保我们掌握了此时的所有细节。有多少警官被起诉？他们被指控了什么？如果你能给我们一些更严重的指控和一些较轻的指控。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. We were making the comment that it feels like this is an onion just being, you know, we're peeling and seeing the layers. There's a lot to it. I want to take a step back just to kind of make sure we have all of the details here at the moment. How many officers have been charged and with what if you can give us sort of some of the more extreme charges versus some of the lesser ones?

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕廖拉**: 是的。所以有 **七名现役多伦多警官** 被起诉，还有一名退休警官。有趣的是，他和他的儿子是此案的共同被告。他的儿子在警队工作大约四年，他们被指控了一系列罪名。一些更严重的指控是，警官们本身被指控 **贩毒**，不仅仅是协助犯罪活动，还包括 **接受贿赂**，以及 **搜索警方数据库**，基本上是将这些机密数据库中的个人信息泄露给已知的所谓罪犯，然后由他们传播。我们知道这导致了一系列犯罪，包括针对一名 **多伦多狱警** 的 **谋杀阴谋**，以及在 **大多伦多地区** 对多处房屋进行枪击。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: Yeah. So seven active duty Toronto police officers were charged, as well as one retired police officer. The interesting bit there is he and his son are co-accused in this case. His son only has around four years on the force and they're charged with a host of things. Some of the more serious charges is the officers are actually charged themselves in trafficking drugs, not just in aiding in that criminal activity, as well as accepting bribes and searching police databases, essentially leaking personal information that's on these confidential databases to known alleged criminals who were then disseminating it. And we know that has led to a series of crimes, including conspiracy to commit a murder against a Toronto jail official and also a shooting various homes through the GTA.

</details>

**主持人**: 公平地说，**谋杀阴谋** 是这份名单上最严重的指控，对吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Fair to say the conspiracy to commit murder. The most serious charge on that list.

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕廖拉**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: It is.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。现在我们……你提到了 **皮尔地区警局**。有三名警官被停职，但未被刑事起诉。我们知道这是否会发展成什么吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. The now we do. You had mentioned Peel police as well. Three officers who have been suspended, not criminally charged. Do we know anything on that if that's going to turn into anything?

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕廖拉**: 是的。嗯，最近我们看到一个名字，可能与保险欺诈有关，这给了我们一点线索。我们不太清楚这些其他警官被指控做了什么，或者他们是否只是在此刻受到怀疑并被停职以待调查。我们只知道他们没有刑事指控，而且我们不确定他们是否会构成刑事指控，但我们正在密切关注。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: Yeah. Well, we got a bit of a clue recently with that name that we saw that may have been involved in the insurance fraud. We don't know too much about what these other officers are alleged to have done, or whether they're just under suspicion at this time and have been suspended pending investigation. We just know that they don't have criminal charges, and we're not sure if they will warrant criminal charges, but we're watching that very closely.

</details>

### 警员关联

**主持人**: 在警区方面，能否给出一些数字？当然，对于很多评论员来说，他们可能不知道这些地方在哪里，但能否对它们的大致位置进行一般性描述？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: In terms of the precincts, throw out some numbers. Obviously, for a lot of reviewers, they probably won't know where they are, but just a general description of where where they are.

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕廖拉**: 是的。所以，大多数这些警官，现役警官被分配到城市西北部的几个分局。所以在 **黑溪（Black Creek）** 和 **北约克（North York）** 地区，有一名警官被分配到一个市中心核心区域的分局。我们知道有些警官在同一个分局工作，即 **12分局**，它位于黑溪地区。所以我们还在拼凑这些警官是如何认识彼此的。过去，例如，我们曾发现一些警官，他们之间总共有19年的服务年限，可能一起从警校毕业。他们职业生涯早期也在12分局一起工作过。所以也许那些关系得以维持。我们仍在试图从大局上理解这些指控是什么，以及阴谋是什么。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: Yeah. So most of these officers, the active officers were assigned to divisions in sort of the northwest part of the city. So in the Black Creek North York areas, there was one officer assigned to a down like a right downtown core division. We know that some of the officers were working at the same divisions, 12 division that's in that Black Creek area. So we're still piecing together how all of the officers may have known one another or came to know one another. In the past, for example, we've been able to figure out that some of the officers who have all been sort of 19 years of service between them, may have graduated from police college together. And they also worked at 12 Division together early in their careers. So perhaps those relationships were maintained. We're still trying to understand what those allegations are and what the conspiracy is on at a big picture level.

</details>

### 巴恩哈特警官

**主持人**: 好的。我想谈谈一位名叫 **蒂姆·巴恩哈特警官** 的警官，他的名字一开始就浮出水面。他是谁？我们了解到他更多的情况吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. I want to talk about one constable whose name really surfaced in the beginning, Constable Tim Barnhart. Who is he? What have we learning more of?

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕廖拉**: 是的。他是12分局的警官之一。他在警队工作了19年。他一直是一名警员，这意味着通常在一个分局，你就像一个“游侠警察”，处理各种需要你关注的案件。他就是其中一名警官，他本人被指控 **贩毒**。我们知道他被指控泄露了那名 **狱警** 的地址，然后那些所谓的罪犯试图杀死他。而且我们还知道他参与了其他所谓的阴谋，比如试图保护城里的 **非法大麻店**。我们知道大麻已经合法化，但仍存在非法大麻问题，因此有许多指控，包括 **妨碍司法公正**、**诬告他人**、**贩毒**，正如我所说，以及参与最终的 **谋杀阴谋**。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: Yeah. So he's one of those 12 division officers. He's been on the force for 19 years. He's been a constable that whole time, which means typically at a division you're like a rogue cop. You go out to nine, 11 calls or anything that requires your attention. He is one of those officers who is himself charged with trafficking in drugs. He is an officer who we know is alleged to have leaked the address of the jail official, who then these alleged criminals tried to kill. Okay. And we also know that he is involved in other alleged conspiracies, such as trying to protect illegal pot shops in the city. We know cannabis was legalized. There are still issues with illegal marijuana, and so there's a whole host of allegations of obstructing justice, falsely accusing people trafficking in drugs, as I said, and that involvement in the eventual conspiracy to commit murder.

</details>

### 拖车战关联

**主持人**: 我知道在多伦多警方公布调查结果的新闻发布会上，有人问到 **“南线计划”（Project South）** 是否与 **“拖车大战”** 有关，这在GTA地区已经成为头条新闻很长一段时间了。我们知道些什么？这之间有更强的联系吗？我们知道些什么？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Now, I know at the press conference when Toronto police unveiled the investigation, there were questions posed to Project South ties to the tow truck wars that have been in the headlines for quite a while in GTA. What do we know? Is there is there a stronger connection there? What do we know about that?

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕廖拉**: 是的，新闻发布会发生时我们有些惊讶。我的同事艾比·奥布莱恩（Abby O'Brien）当时也在场，她一直在大量报道这个拖车问题，我们认出了其中一名平民的名字。此人曾因我提到的在GTA地区（包括旺市）枪击多处房屋的事件而被捕。其中一处房屋据称属于这个拖车行业的一个所谓“**头目**”。正如你提到的，你的观众可能已经看到，那里发生了大量的内斗，甚至可以说是一场“战争”。反复在这些地点、家庭住址、拖车场发生枪击事件。这确实是个大问题。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: Yeah, we were sort of surprised when the press conference happened. My colleague Abby O'Brien was there, and she's been covering this tow truck issue a lot, and we Recognized one of the names of the civilians. That person was previously arrested for the incidents. I mentioned shooting up various houses in the GTA, including in Vaughan. One of those houses allegedly belongs to a so-called kingpin in this tow truck industry, which, you know, your viewers may have seen, as you mentioned, that there's been a lot of infighting to the extent of, you know, calling it a war. Shootings back and forth repeatedly in these locations, home addresses, tow truck yards. It's been really problematic.

</details>

### 审查与影响

**主持人**: 不得不问。这也是在新闻发布会上被问到的一个问题。但由于对警察腐败的调查，是否有任何刑事案件受到影响？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: One has to ask. And this was a question that was asked at that press conference as well. But have any criminal cases been compromised because of the probe into police corruption?

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕廖拉**: 我们一直在积极调查此事。我们一直在与刑事辩护律师沟通以找出答案。到目前为止，我还没有听说有任何案件因此而瓦解，但我认为现在还为时过早。这显然是一个巨大的担忧。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: We've been actively searching that out. We've been talking to criminal defence lawyers to find that out. So far, I haven't heard of any cases falling apart, but I think it's still a little bit early days for that. And that is obviously a huge concern.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。我们提到了 **安大略省警务监察处** 正在对安大略省所有警察部门进行审查。这是否意味着问题不仅仅是几个“害群之马”？显然，这里的案件大部分都与大多伦多地区有关。但这个问题是否超出了这个范围？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. We mentioned Ontario's Inspectorate of Policing is launching a review into all police departments across Ontario. Does that mean the problem goes beyond just a few bad apples? Obviously this case here is really tied into the GTA for the most part. But does this problem go beyond that?

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕廖拉**: 是的，我认为这是一个有效的问题。我个人非常好奇 **警务监察长** 会发现什么。我认为目前没有超出这个多伦多警察部门的指控。而且，你知道，那三名皮尔地区警官也没有被刑事起诉。然而，关于监督、警察如何获取敏感信息以及他们与这些犯罪实体合作的激励机制等方面，存在一些更大的问题。我认为值得探讨。当然，我将非常感兴趣地想知道他们对多伦多警察部队的调查有多深入，以及他们是否会发现该部队存在更多系统性问题。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: Yeah, I think it's a valid question. I'm personally really curious to see what the inspector general finds. I don't think we have any allegations beyond this Toronto Police Department. And, you know, those three Peel officers who have not been criminally charged. However, there are some bigger questions about supervision, the way police have access to sensitive information and just overall, their ability to be incentivised to work with this, these criminal entities. And I think it's worth exploring. Of course, I'll be very interested to know how deeply they go on the Toronto police force and whether they uncover any more systemic issues with that force.

</details>

### 公众反应

**主持人**: 让我们谈谈反应。政治领导人当然很快就他们的想法发表了看法，**警察工会** 也是如此。到目前为止，他们是如何反应的？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Let's talk reaction. Political leaders, of course, have been quick to jump on sort of their thoughts on here, police unions as well. How are they reacting so far?

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕廖拉**: 嗯，有人质疑 **多伦多警察局长米龙·德姆基夫（Myron Demkiw）** 是否会面临领导力方面的质疑。到目前为止，与幕后人士交谈，我并没有看到来自市长办公室、负责监督该部队的警察局或警察工会（他们经常对警务管理发表负面看法）的强烈呼吁，甚至没有任何呼吁。所以，我认为目前德姆基夫局长不会因此承担责任。他似乎对此相当认真。但当然，正如我们所知，调查尚未结束。所以我们只能拭目以待，看政治上如何发展。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: Well, there were some questions about whether Toronto Police Chief Myron Demkiw was going to face questions of leadership so far, talking to people behind the scenes. I'm not seeing any strong calls or any calls at all, really, from the mayor's office, from the police board that oversees the force or from the union, who often has a lot of negative things to say about policing management. So I think for now, Demkiw is not taking the fall for this. He seems to be taking it relatively seriously. But of course, the investigation as we know, is not over. So we're just waiting to see how that plays out politically.

</details>

**主持人**: 你提到了德姆基夫局长。显然，这对 **公众信任** 是一个巨大的打击。所以我很好奇，公众在说什么？你知道，就在不久前，还有人呼吁削减警察经费。我们正在谈论预算。所以，你知道，当我们谈论分配给警察薪资的资金时，这些通常是排名很高的。但公众在说什么？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: You mentioned Chief Demkiw. Obviously this is a big hit to public trust. And so I am curious, what are members of the public saying? You know, it wasn't that long ago when there were calls for defunding the police. We are talking we are in the midst of budgets. So, you know, these are usually pretty high up there when we talk about the money allocated to salaries for police. But what are the public saying?

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕廖拉**: 是的，我认为就像我们过去十年，尤其是在过去五年里，看到人们对警务的态度发生了巨大的转变。我认为这次调查，对很多人来说，证实了他们一直以来感受到的警务腐败现象。现在，我认为没有人真正知道具体发生了什么，或者能够预测到这一点。我当然没有，但我认为它强化了许多对警务的负面看法。这对德姆基夫局长和整个警队来说是一个巨大的挑战，他们需要付出很多努力来修复已经破裂的警务信任。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: Yeah, I think like we've seen such a huge shift in attitudes toward policing over the last decade and especially over the last five years. And I think it this investigation, I think, for a lot of people, validates what they felt was already happening in terms of corrupt policing. Now, I don't think anyone really knew specifically that this was going on or could have predicted this. I certainly didn't, but I think it's reinforcing a lot of negative opinions about policing. And that's a huge mountain for Demkiw and the service as a whole to overcome. And they have a lot of work to do to already repair a fractured trust in policing.

</details>

### 前所未有

**主持人**: 你在这个犯罪报道领域已经有一段时间了。我得问问，在多伦多警察的历史上，或者在你报道过的故事中，有没有发生过类似的事情？我们才刚刚开始。你见过这样的事吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: You have been on the crime beat for a bit here. I got to ask, has there been anything like this in Toronto police history or in just in the stories that you have covered in general? We are just at the beginning here. Yeah. Have you seen anything like this?

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕廖拉**: 不，我真的无法想象会发生这样的事情。你知道，在我们开始听到最初的传闻，然后能够确认有七名警官卷入一项大规模的约克地区警方调查时，这种情况从未发生过。这是 **前所未有** 的。我们正处于未知领域，而且我们仍在等待看事态会发展到何种程度。我问过德姆基夫局长，他是否预计会有更多警员被捕，他说他不想猜测调查会带来什么。所以我们正在关注接下来会发生什么。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: No, I honestly couldn't have imagined anything like this. You know, the night that we were starting to hear the initial rumours and then were able to confirm seven officers accused as part of a massive York police investigation. It's just never happened. It's unprecedented. We're in uncharted territory, and we're still waiting to see how far this goes. I asked chief Demkiw if he expected more arrests of his members, and he said he didn't want to speculate on what the investigation would bring. So we're tuning in to see what happens next.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。我们也会关注。詹妮弗，非常感谢你。非常感谢你的时间。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. As will we. Jennifer, thank you very much. Really appreciate your time.

</details>

**詹妮弗·帕廖拉**: 非常感谢你的邀请。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Pagliaro**: Thank you so much for having me.
