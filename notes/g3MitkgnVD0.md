summary: 市场再度迎来“丑陋的一天”，以太坊领跌加密货币市场，价格跌破3000美元大关，引发广泛抛售。尽管AI投资的长期叙事依然强劲，但科技巨头通过债务融资进行资本支出的行为引发了市场对“AI泡沫”的担忧。更深层次的恐惧源于对私营信贷市场和劳动力市场前景的忧虑，有分析师甚至将其与2006年的次贷危机相提并论。此外，特朗普提出的“关税红利”刺激计划和美联储的降息不确定性，共同加剧了市场的动荡与不安。

title: 加密货币崩盘，市场再现恐慌：私营信贷会是下一个雷区吗？
---

### 市场全线溃败：加密货币首当其冲

好了，大家好。欢迎回到新一期的市场收盘节目。今天是11月17日，星期一，下午3点45分。今天又是一个糟糕的日子，似乎我每次开始这些节目时，都不得不说的第一个词就是“糟糕”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market close. It is a Monday, November 17th, 3:45 p.m. Ugly day once again, and it seems like every time I start off these shows, uh, that is the first word I have to say, which is that the day was ugly, but nonetheless, the day was ugly.</p>
</details>

以太坊今天完全崩溃了。截至本节目开始时，以太坊价格为2979美元。我们曾一度跌至2955美元，正式跌破3000美元大关。由于其价格低于3000美元，我们看到了巨大的痛苦，不仅在加密货币交易中，像BMR这样的资产也同样如此，当日下跌11%，收于303美元。BMR现在已经从高点下跌了超过50%。Robin Hood股价略有回升，超过112美元，但基本上仍在114美元以下，当日下跌7%。Palantir当日下跌2%。谷歌显然因为伯克希尔的投资而表现坚挺，这帮助了谷歌，股价上涨3%，达到285美元。英伟达下跌2.4%，一度触及184美元，之后有所反弹。Meta下跌2%，跌破600美元。Nebia不知何故保持上涨，涨幅2%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, Ethereum completely falling apart today. ETH right here as of the beginning of this show, 2979. We got to 2955. It is officially below $3,000 and as a result of it being below $3,000. I mean, you're seeing a lot of pain, not just in the crypto trade, but obviously as well also in an asset like BMR, $303, down 11% on the day. BMR now down well over 50% from its highs. Robin Hood got a little bit of relief above 112 but basically still uh down below 114 down 7% of the day. Palenter down 2% on the day. Google holding up obviously because of the Birkshire investment. So that's been helping Google and that's 285 that's up 3% on the day. Nvidia that's up or down 2.4%. Nvidia did get at 1 point to 184. So you got a little bit of a bounce right there. So down 3%. Meta down 2% below 600. Nebia somehow holding green up 2%.</p>
</details>

至于标普500指数，我开盘时还守在670点，现在已经跌到664点。我没记错的话，我们刚刚还到过662点，这比周五的水平还要低。周五我们最低跌到663点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the S&P I mean we were holding 670 when I left on the open and now we are at 664. I mean we were just at 662 if I'm not wrong which is uh yeah it's lower than where we were on Friday. 662 is lower than where we were on Friday. Friday we bottomed at 663.</p>
</details>

显然，市场上存在着一些紧张情绪，这与各种叙事有关，我将谈谈这些叙事，并分享一些其他人对当前局势的不同看法。但这正是导致你在整个股票市场看到的恐惧和恐慌情绪的原因。特斯拉曾冲向420美元，今天有可能收跌，目前在407美元。离收盘还有大约14分钟。特斯拉在404美元时挺住了，守住了400美元整数关口，但已经从早上的420美元水平回落。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Obviously, there is some tension going on in the market in regards to a variety of narratives that I'm going to talk about and I'll share some perspectives from some other people that have different ideas in terms of what's going on right now. But that is causing the level of fear and panic that you're seeing across the equity markets. Tesla was pushing 420. Tesla potentially going red on the day. It's at 407. You got about 14 minutes until until the market closes. Tesla, you're holding on. It was at 404. It's holding on to the single 400s, but um it was or it is down from that 420 level that we were at in the uh in the morning.</p>
</details>

### AI 投资热潮下的债务隐忧

那么，到底发生了什么？为什么市场会如此恐慌？首先，我想说我没有看到人工智能交易的结构性变化。我在周五谈到过这一点，我想很多人会同意。我没有看到从上周、上个月或三个月前到现在，在人工智能、资本支出周期、人工智能生产力、利润率提升等方面发生任何变化。如果说有什么不同的话，那就是过去几周我们获得了更多数据，表明这个更广泛的论点是合理的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, what's going on? What's happening? And why are the markets freaking out as much as they're freaking out? First of all, I just want to say I don't see the structural change in the AI trade. And I talked about this on Friday, and I think a lot of people would tend to agree. don't see the change from last week, last month or three months ago to now in regards to what's going on with AI and like the capex spending cycle, AI productivity, margin enhancements. If anything, we've gotten even more data over the past couple of weeks that shows that that is making a lot of sense or that broader thesis is making sense.</p>
</details>

最大的不同显然是一些**超大规模数据中心公司**（Hyperscalers: 指的是像亚马逊、谷歌、Meta这样运营着巨型数据中心的公司）所产生的债务。亚马逊今天早上发行的债券获得了800亿美元的需求。他们进行了一次六部分的债券销售，最终只需要150亿美元，但需求却达到了800亿美元，所以他们的债券需求远超所需。Meta获得了1250亿美元的需求，筹集了300亿美元。谷歌也获得了1000亿美元的需求。所以，这些超大规模数据中心公司借了几十亿美元的债务，这可能让市场有些恐慌，让他们质疑我们是否处于人工智能泡沫中，如果所有这些都是通过债务融资的。我猜这是一个合理的担忧。我不知道这是否从根本上摧毁了我们过去几年一直在讨论的关于人工智能的整个论点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The the big difference has been obviously the debt that has been incurred from some of these hyperscalers. Amazon got 80 billion of demand for the debt that they offered this morning. They did a six-part bond sale. uh that ended up resulting in uh 15 they only needed 15 billion but they had 80 billion in demand so they obviously had way more demand than they needed for their debt. Meta had 125 billion in demand. They raised 30 billion. Google also had 100 billion in demand. So you have some of the hyperscalers taking out a couple billion in in in uh debt which I guess is spooking out the markets a little bit and making them question are we in an AI bubble if all of this is being financed via debt which is I guess a fair concern to have. I don't know if it fundamentally destroys the entire thesis that we've been talking about over the past couple years at this point with AI.</p>
</details>

### 两大幽灵：私营信贷与劳动力市场

话虽如此，我认为这并不是我们过去几周看到的所有痛苦的根本原因。我认为这与**私营信贷**（Private Credit: 指非公开交易的债务，由非银行机构直接向企业提供贷款）有关，这个问题已经开始变得更受关注，我们今天会更多地讨论。然后是劳动力市场。这两件事同时发生，导致了这些我认为是相当随机的盘中抛售，每隔一天就发生一次，然后又出现反弹。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, having said that, I don't think that's the fundamental reason for all the pain that we've been seeing over the past couple of weeks. I think it's about private credit, which has started to become more of a concern, and we'll talk more about that today. and then the labor market. You have those two things going in tandem with each other that's causing these like what I would say is quite random sell-offs intraday every other day and then recoveries.</p>
</details>

因为市场会想：“好吧，我们害怕这些东西，但看看英伟达的财报”，然后我们就跳空高开。接着又出来一个头条新闻，市场又说：“啊，我们不在乎了，但现在我们又在乎了。”这显然对很多人来说是非常上下波动和情绪化的。但我认为正是这些来回摇摆的叙事导致了其中一些问题，一点点的稳定会有所帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because the market's like well you know like yeah we're afraid of this stuff but look at Nvidia's earnings and then we gap back up and then some another headline comes out the market's like ah well we don't care anymore but now we do care and it's like it's obviously very been very up and down and emotional for a lot of people to navigate but I think those are the narratives that are going back and forth which is causing some of these issues and a little bit of stability would help out.</p>
</details>

### Tom Lee 观点：以太坊的基本面依然稳固

我们有很多叙事和话题要谈。首先，Tom Lee，他上了一会儿CNBC。让我播放一下他关于以太坊的言论，然后我们再继续讨论其他一些头条新闻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We got a lot of narratives and a lot of things to talk about. First of all, Tom Lee, he was on CNBC for a little bit. Let me just play what he was saying about Ethereum and then we will keep going from there and get into the rest of some of these headlines.</p>
</details>

> **主持人：** 保持看涨。
>
> **Tom Lee：** 嗯，有关于在以太坊上构建的故事，我们知道正在发生很多事情。有稳定币的创建。拉里·芬克（Larry Fink）和贝莱德（BlackRock）以及华尔街希望将资产代币化，你知道，把股票、债券、房地产带到区块链上，他们必须找到一个中立的、100%正常运行时间的区块链。那就是以太坊。这就是基本面的故事。当然，以太坊的价格会波动，因为加密货币是高度波动的。事实上，这本身就是区块链的一个特点。我认为我们一直处于下降趋势中。不幸的是，很多人在质疑我们是否处于比特币的四年周期中。所以，我们在今天早上发布的主席致辞中谈到了这一点，你知道，与比特币价格最相关的因素，当你看到比特币处于峰值时，实际上是ISM（美国供应管理协会）指数。
>
> **Tom Lee：** 所以，我认为我们仍处于加密货币的修正阶段。你知道，加密货币正遭受10月10日那次清算事件的影响，但因为基本面故事完好无损，而且我们知道，加密货币会提前反映未来，这就是它波动的原因，但它在这里看起来仍然很有吸引力。
>
> **主持人：** 就我个人而言，我认为这次对于以太坊来说，因为你面临着这种普遍的市场避险心态。那么，在此期间，我们应该考虑哪些与以太坊相关的特殊因素呢？
>
> **Tom Lee：** 嗯，以太坊有几种方式来建立一个底部。一种是锁定在区块链上的所有资产的价值。这个数字在增长，但历史上，当这个比率达到约50%时，以太坊就会触底。所以，我想说我们非常接近那个水平。这就是为什么我认为以太坊可能在本周触底。但看待以太坊的另一种方式是看它与比特币的价格比率，甚至是网络价值比率。目前这个数字是0.032。长期平均水平，比如8年平均水平，如果我们只是交易到那个8年平均水平，以太坊的价格将在12000美元左右。所以，我认为以太坊被低估了，因为第一，它的故事相对于比特币今年正在增强，第二，由于锁定在以太坊区块链上的资产价值，我们正在获得这种内在的底部支撑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Stay bullish. >> Well, there's um the story of building on Ethereum and we know that there is a lot taking place. There are stable coin creations. Larry Frink and Black Rockck and Wall Street want to tokenize assets, you know, bring stocks, bonds, real estate onto the blockchain, and they have to find a neutral 100% uptime blockchain. That's Ethereum. Um, and that's the fundamental story. The price of course for Ethereum will fluctuate because crypto is hypervolatile. In fact, it's kind of the it's it's sort of a feature of the blockchain itself. And and I think we've been in a downtrend. Unfortunately, a lot of folks are kind of questioning if we're in a 4-year cycle um for Bitcoin. So, we talk about that in the chairman's message we published this morning that, you know, the the most correlated factor to Bitcoin prices when you see it at a at Bitcoin at a peak actually is the ISM. >> So, I I think we're still in the a correction phase of crypto. you know, crypto suffering from that liquidation event on October 10th, but because the fundamental story is intact and and we we you know, crypto discounts the future, that's why it's volatile, but uh it still looks pretty attractive here. >> And personally, I think this time for Ethereum because you've got this general market uh riskoff mentality. So what are some of the idiosyncratic uh elements that we should be thinking about as it pertains to Ethereum in the meantime? >> Well, Ethereum kind of has several ways that establishes a floor. >> One is that the value of all the assets locked onto the blockchain. Um and that number is growing, but historically Ethereum uh bottoms when that ratio is about 50%. So we're I'd say we're pretty close to that level. That's why I think Ethereum probably is bottoming this week. But the other way to look at Ethereum is really its price ratio or even its network value ratio to Bitcoin. It currently sits at this number is 0.032. The long-term average like the 8-year average if if we were just to trade to that 8-year average would put Ethereum at around 12,000. So, I think Ethereum is undervalued because number one, uh, the story is gaining relative to Bitcoin this year, but two, we're getting this sort of intrinsic floor because of the value that the assets locked onto the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
</details>

Tom Lee说以太坊本周将触底。这与他一直以来的论点基本相同。问题是，股票市场会相信他所说的话吗？在临近收盘时，我们看到了一点反弹，但随后反弹又被拒绝了。我的意思是，这种价格走势简直令人难以置信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> All right. Uh, Tom Lee saying that Ethereum is bottoming this week. >> Again, kind of the same argument Tom Lee's been making for a while. Uh and the question is just you know well the equity markets kind of believe what he's saying right there. You're getting a little bit of a bounce as we get into the close and then that bounce is getting rejected. I mean again this price action is just incredible.</p>
</details>

感觉上，加密货币世界里有人正在被大规模追加保证金。我们说的不是散户投资者被追加5万美元的保证金，而是那些杠杆过高的机构投资者，他们被追加数十亿美元的保证金，结果造成了这种系统性的下跌。这可能是正在发生的另一件事。但总的来说，我们得看看它在未来几天是否会稳定下来，以及稳定后的价格走势会是怎样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know what it also feels like and this is some other stuff I was reading today. It feels like someone in the world of crypto is getting margin called heavily. And we're not talking about a retail investor that's getting margin called for like 50,000 bucks. We're talking about some institutional investors that were heavily overlevered and you know are getting margin called for billions and as a result it's creating a lot of this systemic decline. That could be another thing that's happening. But overall we're going to have to see when it does stabilize if it does stabilize in the coming days for what that price action looks like.</p>
</details>

### 特朗普的“关税红利”：是刺激还是通胀？

就在我准备直播的时候，我们收到了特朗普的一些头条新闻。我还没有他这么说的视频片段，但显然他确实这么说了。他说，“2000美元的关税刺激支票将在2026年中期分发。”这是特朗普先生大约10分钟前的原话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, we got some headlines from Trump right when I was about to go live. Uh, I don't have the clip of him saying this yet, but apparently he did indeed say this. $2,000 tariff stimulus checks will be distributed by the middle of 2026. That is the quote from Mr. Trump about 10 minutes ago.</p>
</details>

首先，我不知道他如何在没有国会批准的情况下发出支票。我不知道国会是否会批准印制至少2000亿美元。第三，我的意思是，与偿还债务相比，这真的是我们想做的事吗？我能理解退税，我能理解税收抵免，这是通过关税回馈美国消费者的方式，但直接印2000美元……我的意思是，我们上次这么做是在全球大流行期间，当时每个人都失去了工作，人们需要钱。所以，我不知道现在情况有那么糟。我不是说情况完美，但显然，你有这些刺激想法来对抗可负担性叙事，问题是这会奏效吗？而且很方便的是，中期选举也快到了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, first of all, I don't know how he's going to be able to send out checks without congressional approval. I don't know if Congress is going to approve printing what would amount to be at least $200 billion. Uh, and number three, I mean, is this really what we want to be doing versus pay down the debt? You know, I can understand a tax rebate. I can understand a tax credit and like that's the way to give back to the American consumers via tariffs, but straight up printing $2,000. I mean, the last time we did that, we had a global pandemic where everyone lost their job and people needed money. So, like, I don't know if things are that bad. I'm not saying things are perfect, but obviously, you know, you got these stimulus ideas combating the affordability narrative and the question is just going to be is that going to work? And conveniently, you have the midterms coming up as well.</p>
</details>

### 私营信贷：下一个“次贷危机”？

市场对私营信贷的担忧正在加剧，我认为这造成了更多的痛苦。让我们听听这段关于私营信贷的分析，我认为这会让我们进入更广泛的讨论，了解正在发生什么，以及为什么某些投资者感到痛苦，或者至少认为会有更多的痛苦到来。这是关于Blue Owl Capital的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">a lot of it is starting to pop up in this private credit issue, which is, I think, creating a little bit more pain. So, let me pull up some analysis right here on private credit. Let's take a listen to this and I think it'll kind of get us into the broader discussion of what's going on and why certain investors are feeling certain pain or at least are thinking that there's more pain to come. This is with Blue Owl Capital. Let's take a listen to this and then we'll get deeper into some of the other headlines we have.</p>
</details>

> **主持人：** 《华尔街日报》写道，华尔街不顾泡沫担忧，为人工智能支出狂潮火上浇油。这是一家对数据中心寄予厚望的公司。它的增长故事在某种程度上与那个故事相关联。顺便说一下，Blue Owl是Meta数据中心融资的承销商之一。所以这就是为什么Blue Owl处于数据中心融资建设的中心。
>
> **记者：** 市场对此感到不安，因为什么？嗯，市场不安的是，这些私营信贷公司分享的按市价计价的估值，可能在每个时间点都不能完全反映表面之下的实际情况。我想补充一点，除了《华尔街日报》的文章，它加剧了人们已经对数据中心整体债务负担感到紧张的主题，Blue Owl今天的另一个头条新闻是《金融时报》的一篇报道，涉及两个基金的合并。这有点技术性，但请耐心听我说。Blue Owl基本上正在合并其最早的私营信贷基金之一，即拥有约10亿美元资产的Blue Owl Capital Corporation 2，该基金针对富裕个人，与一个名为OBDC的更大基金合并，后者拥有170亿美元资产。现在，由于这次合并，他们说，较小的基金将面临约20%的损失，因为OBDC正以20%的资产净值（NAV）折价交易。所以，如果这笔交易获得股东批准，两者的合并将使一些富裕投资者面临约20%的损失。
>
> **主持人：** 用外行人的话来说，私营信贷市场上有很多人不相信为这些数据中心和各种其他东西发行的债务。Blue Owl是全国最大的贷款机构之一。所以有很多不同的事情，但他们关注的是数据中心部分。我们通过甲骨文的信用违约互换看到了这一点。我们看到CoreWeave即使在积压订单同比增长100%达到550亿美元的情况下，仍在继续受到冲击。你有一系列本应对整个资本支出领域利好的事情，但同时又有人说，如果这没有按预期发展会怎样？你有关我们讨论过的AI泡沫的担忧，这可能导致数据中心市场出现更多痛苦，或者至少是感知到更多痛苦，以及围绕贷款的AI泡沫担忧。这些是真实的担忧吗？我不知道。我自己也需要对这些东西做更多的研究，但这些担忧足以让人们开始思考到底发生了什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Reads, Wall Street blows past bubble worries to supercharge AI spending frenzy. This is a firm that has high hopes around data center. Um, its growth story is leverage to that story in in some ways. Blue Owl, by the way, was one of the underwriters for Meta's uh data center financing. So, that's why Blue Owl is at the center of kind of this data center finance buildup. >> And the market is uneasy about this because of what? Well, the market is uneasy that the the marks uh the marktomarket that these private credit firms are sharing uh may not be fully reflective at each point in time of what's actually happening under the surface. Uh, and one thing I would add too, Scott, in addition to the Wall Street Journal article, which is kind of feeding into this theme that people are already kind of nervous about with regard to just the overall debt loads and data centers, another headline for Blue Owl today is one that's in the FT, which involves the merging of two funds. This is a little bit technical, but bear with me. So, Blue Owl is essentially merging one of its earliest private credit funds, uh, Blue Owl Capital Corporation 2, which has about a billion dollars in assets. targeting wealthy individuals with a larger fund called OBDC which has 17 billion. Now as a result of this they're saying that uh essentially the the smaller fund is going to be uh essentially the facing losses of about 20% because that is what is uh happening for OBDC which is trading at a discount of 20% to NAV. So essentially if the deal is approved by shareholders, the merging of the two would see some of those wealthy investors face uh about 20% losses there. >> But those at its core to kind of deduce what she's saying in layman's term, you got a lot of people in the private credit market that are not believing the debt that is being issued for these data centers and a variety of other things. Blue Owl's like one of the largest lenders in the country. So there's a lot of different things, but the data center part is what they're focusing on. And we're seeing that through the credit default swaps on Oracle. We're seeing that on uh Corewave continuing to get hit even with their, you know, 52 or 55% increase in backlog or 55 billion backlog increasing 100% year-over-year. Like you've just got a variety of things that should be bullish for the overall space around capex, but then you've got people saying, well, what if this doesn't play out the way it's going to play out? You've got the concerns about the AI bubble obviously that we've talked about and that's leading to more pain potentially or at least the the um the uh the perception of more pain potentially in the data center market AI bubble concerns around lending. Uh are those real concerns? I don't know. I mean I think I' I myself have to do a lot more research on this stuff as well, but they are enough concerns to get people to start wondering what the heck is going on.</p>
</details>

这是另一位相当大的投资者和他对当前情况的看法。这是一个一分钟的片段，他做了一个55分钟的播客，但这里是他说的私营信贷是下一个下跌的东西的一分钟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here was uh another pretty large investor and um his take on what's going on. This is a minute. He did a 55minute podcast, but here is a minute of him saying private credit is the next thing to kind of take a dip.</p>
</details>

> **投资者：** 关于私营信贷最荒谬的论点是，私营信贷属于每个投资组合，因为它能让你高枕无忧，帮助你度过公共信贷的波动。这只是对波动的重新包装。如果你不按市价计价，就没有波动。但如果价格在几周内从100跌到0，那就有不好的事情发生了。所以我对那些不透明的市场非常非常悲观。我大概已经说了两年了，金融市场的下一次大危机将是私营信贷。它具有与2006年次级抵押贷款重新包装相同的特征。现在，它花了几年时间才完全瓦解。所以这种事情不会在一周甚至一年内发生。但我对此非常悲观。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Ridiculous argument of all for private credit has been private credit belongs in every portfolio because it lets you sleep at night because it helps you ride out the volatility of your public credit. Again, that's just a repackaging of the volatility. If you don't market to market, there's no volatility. But if the price goes from 100 to zero in a matter of a few weeks, uh there's there's something something uh unoured is going on. And so I'm very very negative on those types of uh you know, non-transparent markets. It reminds me, I've been saying this for probably two years now, that the next big crisis in the financial markets is going to be private credit. Uh it's it's it it has the same trappings as subprime mortgage pack repackaging had back in 20 uh 2006. Now it took a couple of years for it to totally unravel. So this stuff doesn't happen in a week or a year even. But I'm very negative on that.</p>
</details>

这太不可思议了，对吧？我的意思是，他说私营信贷中发生的事情与2008年那些被打包再打包然后出售的债券，即**CDO**（Collateralized Debt Obligation: 债务抵押债券）有相同的特征。他说所有这些都是有问题的。他接着说，美国金融市场是他一生中见过的估值最高的金融市场。所以，你有一个在金融媒体领域相对受尊重的人，基本上声称这又是2008年。即使不是，当有人说出这样的话时，对于所有想知道为什么市场下跌的人来说，这会成为头条新闻，人们听到有人这么说时会立即采取行动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> It's quite incredible, right? I mean, he's saying what's going on in private credit has the same packages of the the sort of bonds that were packaged with other bonds and then sold on top of other different bonds with the CDOS's back in 2008. Uh, and says that all these are faulty. He went on to say that the US financial markets are the most overvalued financial markets I've seen in my entire lifetime. So, you got someone who's relatively respected in the financial media space basically making the claim that this is 2008 again. And but you know, even if it's not, someone's saying something like that for everyone wondering like, why are markets down? Well, because that's going to make headlines and people are going to take action immediately when they hear someone say stuff like that.</p>

### 美联储的困境：降息预期与经济现实

美联储主席沃勒发表了一些言论。首先，他说我们应该更关注劳动力市场，而不是当前的通胀超调。他说，“我听说公司正在通过不招聘来支付人工智能投资。”然后第三，他说，“降息25个基点不会让就业增长回到原来的水平。”

<details>

<p class="english-text">You had uh Fed President Waller say a couple things. So, number one, he said we should be paying more attention to the labor market than the current inflation overshoot.

好的，所以终于有人说，“是的，我们可能应该把重点放在劳动力市场上，而不是通货膨胀上。”我希望他的观点是整个美联储的观点。但他说了我认为最明显的三件事。第一，我们应该关注劳动力而不是通货膨胀。第二，25个基点甚至可能不足以使就业市场恢复到以前的水平。第三，他说了一件很多人一直在说的事，那就是“我听说公司正在通过不招聘来支付人工智能投资。”我的意思是，我想我们从各种不同的人那里听到了这个说法，公司支付所有这些人工智能支出的方式之一，即使他们不是世界上最大的公司，即使他们是像亚马逊这样刚刚解雇了3万人的公司，也是通过降低成本。

<p class="english-text">Okay, so finally, you have someone actually saying that, "Yeah, we should probably focus on the labor market over inflation. And I wish his opinion was the opinion of the uh entire Federal Reserve. But he says the three things that I think are the most obvious. Number one, we should be focusing on labor versus inflation. Number two, 25 bips might not even be enough to increase the job market back to levels to where it was. And then number three, he said something that a lot of people have been saying, which is that I'm hearing that firms are paying for AI investment by not hiring. I mean, I think we've heard this from a variety of different people, that one of the ways that companies are paying for all this AI expenditures, even if they're not like the biggest companies in the world, and even if they are, like an Amazon, which just fired 30,000 people, is by reducing costs.</p>

是的，沃勒是**鸽派**（Dovish: 在货币政策上倾向于降息和宽松政策以刺激经济）。他一直是鸽派。问题是，美联储中有相当一部分人不是鸽派，我认为这也给12月是否会降息的想法带来了更多痛苦。

<p class="english-text">Yes. So, Wall Yes. So, Waller is doubbish. He's always been doubbish. The problem is you have a decent chunk of people that are not doubbish um on the Fed and I think that's also creating a lot of more pain in uh in the idea for if we're going to get a rate cut in December.</p>

### 投资者如何应对市场动荡？

对于很多问如何应对这种情况或者我在想什么的人，我认为有三件显而易见的事情可以做，非常简单。第一是卖出一些激进的备兑看涨期权。举个例子，假设你拥有一千股Nebius，平均成本是95美元。你可以每周卖出激进的备兑看涨期权来产生一些权利金，以减轻Nebius下跌带来的冲击。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, for a lot of people asking kind of how do you navigate the situation or what are you thinking about? I think there's three obvious things you can do, right? Very simple things. Number one is you sell some aggressive covered calls. So, example, let's say you own a thousand shares of Nebius and your average is $95. You can be selling aggressive covered calls every week to generate some premium to soften the blow from Nebius getting hit.</p>
</details>

第二是你可以买入看跌期权。买一些看跌期权并不疯狂。你可以采取同样的策略，买入远期价外看跌期权。如果你想保护你的Robin Hood头寸，并且你持有2000股成本为70美元的Robin Hood股票，而今天Robin Hood股价是115美元，你可以根据整体头寸按比例购买一些看跌期权，比如行权价为85美元或95美元，或者你认为在Robin Hood可能遭受重创的情况下相对合理的任何行权价。

<p class="english-text">Number two is you can buy puts. Number two is you can buy puts. It's not crazy to buy some puts. You can do the same strategy. Buy far out the money puts. If you think you want to protect your Robin Hood position and you have 2,000 shares of Robin Hood at 70 bucks, Robin's at 115 today. you can buy a proportional amount of puts in relationship to the overall position for, I don't know, $85, $95, whatever strike that you think is relatively reasonable if you were to think Robin Hood were to get hit pretty bad if things were to get bad.</p>
</details>

第三个选择，也是最明显的选择，就是你可以卖出股票。很多这些股票今年迄今为止涨幅巨大。Nebius今年迄今仍上涨近2倍，Robin Hood上涨2倍，Palantir上涨1.5倍，英伟达上涨50%。我的意思是，说到底，另一个简单的选择就是你可以获利了结。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the third option, which is the one that is the most obvious, right? You can sell stock. A lot of these names are up a lot year to date. Nebas, you know, still up almost 2x year today. Robin Hood's up 2x, poundry is up 1.5x, Nvidia's up 50%. I mean, at the end of the day, the other simple option is you can take some profits, which you know, I I think a lot of retail has been pretty smart about taking profits this year, and we've seen that through the data that retail has actually been actively managing portfolios, but some profits are better than no profits.</p>

### 特朗普的“亲民”牌：在麦当劳峰会谈经济

这个可负担性问题，伙计，这个问题像一块砖头一样砸中了本届政府。我不认为他们预料到这个可负担性问题会如此严重。但它确实来了，伙计。就像彻底摧毁了他们正在取得的很多进展，因为一旦某件事成为一个叙事，它就成了一个叙事。

<p class="english-text">This affordability thing, dude, this thing hit the administration like a brick. I don't think they expected this affordability [ __ ] to come through. And boy did it come through, man. Like absolutely nuked a lot of the progress they were making because now once something becomes a narrative. I mean, it becomes a narrative and it's I mean</p>

特朗普计划在年底前在白宫举行竞选集会演讲，讨论经济问题。所以我们上周的头条新闻是他将周游全国进行这些演讲。显然他现在要在白宫做这件事，或者至少他们是这么计划的，这是他们试图论证经济状况良好的尝试。是的，特朗普将在年底前在国内举办大型室内集会，讨论经济。

<p class="english-text">Uh Trump is planning campaign rally speeches at the White House to talk about the economy towards the end of the year. So we we last week was the headline that he's going to travel the country for these speeches. Apparently he's doing it now at the White House or at least that's what they're planning and um that is their attempt to kind of make the argument that the economy is doing okay. Yeah. Trump to host large indoor rallies domestically before year end to discuss the economy.</p>

特朗普将在与麦当劳所有者的会议上谈论经济。在担心通货膨胀的美国人日益增大的压力下，美国总统唐纳德·特朗普将于周一会见快餐连锁店麦当劳的所有者、经营者和供应商，以宣传其政府为降低生活成本所做的努力。告诉我这个可负担性问题不是政府关心的事情。

<p class="english-text">Trump to talk up econ Oh wow. Trump to talk up economy and meeting with McDonald's owners. Under mounting pressure from Americans worried about inflation, US President Donald Trump will meet on Monday with owners, operatives, and suppliers of fast food chain McDonald's to tout his administration's efforts to drive down living costs. See, tell me that this affordability thing is not something the administration cares about.</p>
</details>

伙计，你是在开玩笑吗？你用电影预告片来宣传一个对麦当劳加盟商所有者关于可负担性的演讲，而我们还认为可负担性只是某种随机的策略。不，显然政府正在倾向于这个说法。如果特朗普不关心可负担性，他会认为这只是民主党的骗局或愚蠢的叙事。他不会说“让美国再次负担得起”。他不会在麦当劳做演讲。他正在试图改变叙事，因为我敢肯定他的政治顾问在说：“总统先生，如果我们不赢得这场辩论，我们就会输掉中期选举。”我觉得这就是他转变的原因。

<p class="english-text">Like, dude, are you kid? You're you're you're freaking using movie trailers to promote a speech to McDonald's franchisee owners around affordability, and we think affordability is still some random like tactic. It's like, no, obviously the administration is leaning into if if Trump didn't give a [ __ ] about affordability and he was he would think it's like some Democratic hoax or stupid narrative. He would not be saying make America affordable again. He would not be doing a speech at McDonald's. He's trying to change the narrative because I'm sure his political consultants are saying, "Mr. President, we're going to lose the midterms if we don't win this argument." Like, I feel like that's the reason for the pivot.</p>

总而言之，我讨厌一遍又一遍地重复，但我认为，如果你能得到降息，并且人工智能的盈利前景保持不变，那么年底仍然可以非常强劲。只是显然有越来越多的事情正在叠加，给这个整体的市场叙事制造了一些障碍。

<p class="english-text">Again, at its core, I hate saying this over and over again, but I think end of year can still be very strong if you get the rate cut and you have the AI earnings picture stay intact. It's just obviously more and more things are compounding to create some hiccups in this overall overall market narrative, I would say.</p>

但这就是市场的动态之处，对吧？几周前，我们以为有区域性银行业危机，然后我们忘了。三个月前，我们以为有穆迪的债券评级危机，然后我们又忘了。市场会思考一些事情，关心一些事情。谁知道呢？也许再过几天，就没人关心甲骨文的信用违约互换了，尽管他们今天很关心。这为市场上的买卖双方提供了机会。你需要这些相互冲突的叙事来回发生。对于每一个叙事，都有一个买家和一个卖家。我们的工作是试图识别正在发生的趋势。

<p class="english-text">And look, that happens that I mean that like that's that's that's why markets are so dynamic, right? I mean, a couple weeks ago, we thought there was a regional banking crisis, then we forgot about it. Three months ago, we thought there was a bond rating crisis with Moody's, then we forgot about it. Like, the market thinks about stuff. They care about stuff. Who knows? Maybe in another couple of days, no one cares about Oracle's credit default swaps, even though they're caring today. That's what gives opportunities to either buy or sell in the market. You need these conflicting narratives happening back and forth. And for every narrative, there's a buyer and a seller. Our job is to try to identify the trend that's taking place.</p>
