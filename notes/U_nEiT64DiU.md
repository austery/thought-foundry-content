### 金银市场剧烈震荡与投资新趋势

大家好，我是主持人Shout Down Filling In。欢迎收听《参考信息》第561期。此前持续飙升的贵金属价格，在国际金银价格触及历史高位后的交易日里，经历了戏剧性的暴跌。在1月31日北京时间凌晨，金银价格几乎回吐了过去半个月的所有涨幅。伦敦黄金当日收盘下跌9.45%，创下近40年来最大单日跌幅。纽约商品交易所黄金期货在盘中交易中一度下跌高达14%，从前一日创下的每盎司5626.80美元的历史高位，骤降至4700.40美元，最终收于4907美元。白银的波动则更为剧烈，纽约商品交易所白银期货在日内交易中一度暴跌38%，创下新的历史高点后回落。伦敦白银收盘下跌26.77%，同样是自1980年代初以来最大的单日跌幅。此外，现货黄金下跌18%，现货白银下跌15%。市场普遍认为，特朗普任命**鲍威尔**（Jerome Powell）——这位前美联储理事——为新任美联储主席，结束了持续半年的悬念，是此次暴跌的直接原因。2月1日，监管机构发布了高风险预警，建议投资者避免盲目追涨杀跌，理性控制仓位，防范市场波动风险。

黄金市场相关的社会新闻频频成为热点话题。一名在某省的男子在乘坐高铁前往湖北时，携带价值数百万的黄金被安保人员拦下。该男子是某金厂的员工。另一起事件中，一节火车车厢内遗落了12公斤黄金，在多方协助下，这批黄金最终物归原主。原来，这些是某珠宝公司的展品。列车乘务员表示，这是他20年工作中发现的最贵重物品。这箱黄金价值数千万美元。在一家金店，店员向警方报告称，一名顾客单次交易购买了超过300克黄金，怀疑可能涉及洗钱（AA - Anti-Money Laundering checks）。该顾客的付款被警方拦截，揭露了欺诈行为。更令人担忧的是深圳某黄金交易公司“GO Rowe”的动荡。该公司倒闭及老板失联的消息持续发酵。该平台约有15万注册用户，其中许多人投资了数十万甚至上百万美元的黄金或等值资金。据报道，涉及金额可能超过一亿元人民币。深圳市某区已成立工作组，并发布多份声明以稳定情绪，敦促“GO Rui”处置资产并启动还款，同时表示报告的金额已严重失实。世界黄金协会报告称，到2025年，全球黄金需求将首次突破5500吨，达到5020吨的新高。投资需求已取代实物消费，成为最大的需求来源，个人和机构投资者成为中长期主导力量。尽管美联储的货币政策趋于谨慎，但并未改变长期对地缘政治风险的担忧。在全球“去美元化”的背景下，全球主流机构将持续增加对贵金属的配置，且多国央行的购金需求依然强劲，为金价提供了中长期的上行潜力。有分析师担忧，黄金24小时的价格波动幅度高达14%，与比特币在高峰期时的波动类似，它是否还能被视为避险资产？

随着全球黄金市场持续了三年，贵金属的价值发生了显著变化。黄金及其他贵金属的价值已溢出至其他贵金属。2025年，白银价格的涨幅超过了黄金。主要原因之一是白银具有更强的工业属性，更广泛的工业应用以及供需缺口导致了白银更大的价格弹性。其他贵金属如铂、钯，以及稀有的工业金属，供应量极其有限且供应链脆弱。结合其不可替代的工业属性和不断扩大的工业应用场景，需求具有更大的弹性。这种涉及铜条的非传统投资趋势近期出现，吸引了一些企业和客户的注意，包装成“穷人的黄金”。其市场价格飙升，伦敦洲际交易所七个月期铜价格在12月上涨了11.69%，1月6日价格达到20美分。今年1月6日，价格强力突破了每吨13407美元的关口，创下历史新高。深圳市场也出现了铜条投资的短暂飙升，一千克铜条以每克180至299元的价格售出。即使是商家也觉得难以理解，指出加工费比铜本身的价格还高，回收也只能通过废金属经销商。一些商家表示只卖不收回。大约在1月20日，深圳市场紧急叫停了铜条的公开销售。为何铜条会成为热门投资狂潮？首先，贵金属的高价触发了对替代品的需求。随着金银价格飙升，普通投资者难以承受，但又害怕错过潜在收益，因此寻求低价替代品。其次，商家受利润驱动。一些商家承认，销售铜条是为了吸引客户，进而推广白银和黄金销售。值得注意的是，“投资铜条”的话题在社交媒体平台获得了显著关注，内容的发酵效应进一步刺激了对铜条的投资。当市场情绪被点燃时，商家通过线上推广和私下订单迅速清空库存，将风险转移给投资者。然而，与黄金拥有成熟的回收体系和较小的价差相比，铜条本质上是工业原材料，加工费高昂。以每吨10万的价格为例，分解为1000个1公斤的铜条，每个成本应为100美元，但它们却以超过180美元的价格售出，涨幅超过50%。铜的期货价格超过每吨10万多美元，加工成铜条后，价格涨至每吨12万至13万美元。这意味着普通投资者需要铜价翻倍才能回本。然而，即使在2025年铜价飙升的情况下，累计年增长率也仅约30%，价格翻倍的可能性极小。如果购买价格为每公斤180美元，但你想卖掉它，废品回收站只认铜锭价格，目前为30美元，买卖将立即使你的资本损失超过50%。业内人士提醒，许多散户投资者认为，既然买不起金条，购买铜条是一种消费降级下的资产配置，这是一个误解和逻辑谬误。投资的本质是购买流动性和预期的升值，而不是购买铜本身。

hello，
everyone。
i'm shout down filling in is the host for this eeisode de。
welcome to the five hundred sixty first issue of reference information，
the continuously soaring，

the gold bold market issued a related social news frequently became a hot topic。
a man in an on province was called by security personnel，
while taking a high speed train to hubez with million new wan worth a gold。
the man was an employee of a gold factory。
separately，
twelve kilogrims of gold were left behind in a spespetrain carriage，
arriving in shanghai with the help of multiple parties，
the gold was finally returned its owner。

the train conductor said。
it was the most valuable item he had found in his twenty years of working。

can it still be considered a safe haven？
asasthe gogolball market has lasted for three years，
and the value of precious medals has undergone significant changes。
the value of gold and other precious medals has spilled over into other precious medals。
in twenty twenty five，
the increase in silver prices exceeded that of gold。
one of the main reasons been that silver has stronger industrial properties，
wider industrial applications and origent supply gap lead to greater price elasticity for silver，
other precious medals such as platanum and poladium，
as well as rare industrial medals have extremely limited supply and weak supply chains。
couple ed as rrereplaceable industrial properties as industrial application scenario continued to expand demand has greater lastiity。
this unconventional investment trend involving in copper bars has recently emerged，
attracting the attention of some businesses and customers packaged popoor mans gold。
its market price has surged the london ddexexchange seven monmonth copper price rose by eleven point six，

the shenjen market also saw a brief surgein copper bar investment with one thousand gracocoper bars being sold for one hundred eighty to two hundred ninety nine。
new on a price，
even merchants found in comprehensible，
noting the processing fees were more expensive than the corporate cell recycling was only possible through scrap metal dealers。
some merchants stated they would sell but not buy back the bars around january twenty eoth。
the chinjen market urgtly ally alted，
the public public sale of copper bars。
why did copper bars become a popular investment craze？
firstly，
the high price of precious medals trigger to demand for alternatives with gold den silver prices，
soaring ordinary investor space。
the demma not be able to four gold，
but fearing missing out on potential gains，
thus seeking low pressuld alternatives 是不有回据。
secondly，
businesses were driven by profit。
some merchants admitted that selling copper bars was a way to attract customers and then promote silver and gold sales。
notably，
the topic investing in copper bars，
gain significant attraction on social media platforms and the immplification effect of this content，
further stimulated investment in copper bars。
when market sentiment was ignited，
merchants quickly sold off their stock through online promotion in private orders，
shifting the risk to investors。
however，
compared to gold，
which has a well established recycling system with small small price spreads。
copper bars are essentially industrial ramaterials with high processing fees as on a copper price around one hundred thousand u。
one and broken down into one thousand one kilogram coppbars。
each should cost one hundred d on，
but they were sold for over one hundred eighty unon mark。
up over over fifty percent。
the futures price of coper is over one hundred thousand u，
one per ten，
and after processing into copper ars ars，
the rises to one hundred twenty thousand to one hundred thirty thousand d one per tent。
this means the ordinary investors would need the copper price to double to break even。
however，
even in the soaring coppu on per twenty twenty five，
the cumulative annual increase was only about thirty percent，
making a double in price highly unlikely if the purchase pris one hundred eighty u on per kilogram，
but if you want to sell it，
the scrap hello recycling station only recognizes the boilpoint price price is currently tly NEDU on buying and selling would instantly reduce your capital by more than fifty percent。
industry insiders remind that many retail investors think that since they can't afford goal，
bars，
buying copper bars is an acid allocation under consumption downgrading，
which is a misconception and a logical fallacy。
the essence of investment is buying liquidity and expected appreciation not buying copper。

### 金融欺诈与跨境劫案

近期，香港发生了两起涉及天文数字伪造支票的离奇案件。1月27日，香港某银行西部支行的一名银行职员向警方报案，称有两男两女持一张要求提取100亿美元的支票前来，怀疑是伪造支票。经过调查，警方以涉嫌使用伪造文件逮捕了四人。这四人均自称是同事。其中一名66岁、姓李的男子持澳门旅行证件从内地入境。两名23岁的女子持护照从内地入境，另一名77岁的香港居民姓朱。警方表示，银行职员当天接待了这四位顾客，他们声称要在该银行开户，并出示了一张面值100亿美元的支票要求提取。由于金额巨大，该职员仔细检查后怀疑是伪造支票，遂报警。这是香港近20天内的第二起类似案件。1月8日，在香港某太平洋广场的一家银行，一名自称是女商人的顾客出示了一张要求提取160亿欧元的存款单，怀疑是伪造文件。经调查，警方也以涉嫌使用伪造文件将其拘留。这位65岁的乔姓女子持澳门旅行证件从内地入境。此外，1月15日，一名女性加密货币中介和三名男子携带一张面值1.6亿港元的支票到某商业银行进行鉴定。银行经理发现该支票已被兑现，并发现其可疑之处，遂报警。经过调查，警方将这些案件列为刑事调查，涉案人员被带走问话。香港旺角也发生过类似的伪造文件案件。去年10月，两名内地女子在香港某银行办理支票相关业务时，出示了四份文件。银行工作人员发现文件可疑，怀疑是伪造的，遂报警。警方调查后，初步逮捕了两名女子，涉嫌使用伪造文件。根据香港《犯罪条例》第200条，制造、销售或使用伪造文件是严重罪行。任何制造、使用或持有明知或相信是伪造的文件，意图诱使他人接受为真，从而导致他人遭受损失的人，可被判处最高刑罚。

近期，香港还发生了一起涉及日本人的大规模抢劫案。1月30日上午9点30分，两名日本员工乘坐出租车前往香港岛一家外汇兑换店，携带1亿日元（约合850万人民币）兑换港元。下车后，两名劫匪突然靠近，抢走了其中一名员工背包里的5100万日元现金，并迅速逃入一辆等候的汽车。整个过程仅持续了数十秒。事故发生约六小时后，三名主要嫌疑人（两名日本男子为劫匪，一名内地女子参与了犯罪前的准备工作）已离开香港国际机场。警方还逮捕了该外汇兑换店的两名员工（一名28岁的香港男子和一名29岁的内地男子），他们涉嫌协助劫匪处理部分赃款。奇怪的是，其中一名受害者实际上是犯罪团伙安插的“内鬼”。更离奇的是，这笔钱在运往香港之前，已经在日本遭遇了一次未遂抢劫。据NHK报道，1月30日凌晨，一名50多岁的男子携带约1.91亿日元现金抵达东京羽田机场停车场。一辆白色私家车靠近，车内人员用催泪瓦斯袭击了他。然而，抢劫未遂，该男子随后携带现金飞往香港。日本警方调查认为，这两起案件的受害者很可能是同一个人。香港警方已追回约1100万日元，但剩余的4000万日元仍在追踪。此外，1月29日晚上9点30分，东京涩谷区也发生了一起类似的抢劫案。五名包括中国籍和日本籍人士在内的嫌疑人在运输装有4.2亿日元现金的三个手提箱时，遭到三名黑衣男子用催泪瓦斯袭击，所有现金被盗。劫匪乘车逃逸。这笔巨款据称也计划运往香港兑换港元。1月份，上海也发生了一起大规模日元抢劫案。一家从事虚拟货币和奢侈品业务的日本公司两名员工，携带1亿日元现金，在一家货币兑换店附近下车时，一辆七人座车辆突然靠近，三名持刀劫匪下车，抢走了装有现金的四个行李箱。整个过程约30秒。警方随后披露，已逮捕包括主谋和所有劫匪在内的15人，但赃款去向仍在调查中。这些案件的手法显示出高度的计划性、暴力袭击和明确的目标。情报分析表明，涉及的日本公司可能是将现金运往香港兑换港元，在香港购买免税商品，并从两地税收差价中获利。警方正在调查这些案件是否涉及洗钱等犯罪活动。4.2亿日元抢劫案的现金来自一家贵金属商店，香港警方调查还发现，5100万日元抢劫案受害者的公司也从事贵金属业务。日本对进口黄金、白银和其他贵金属征收10%的消费税。因此，犯罪分子经常将黄金从香港等免税地区走私到日本销售，从消费税差价中获利。去年，香港海关查获了数起从香港走私黄金到日本的案件。

### 跨国犯罪陷阱：电信诈骗园区与绑架案

1月中旬，一名中国公民在泰国芭提雅被同胞绑架的案件引发公众关注。一名35岁的中国女房地产经纪人在向一位中国客户展示房产时，该客户突然持刀抢劫并刺伤了她。幸运的是，在关键时刻发生了意想不到的转折，在路人的帮助下，她最终获救。警方已确认嫌疑人身份并展开追捕。受害者在危险面前的反应也引发了媒体的讨论。去年另一件引起媒体关注的事件发生在2022年8月，来自河北省的两位年轻男子（Ymoubing和Young Mumu）在云南旅游时突然失踪。他们后来出现在柬埔寨的一个电信诈骗园区，引发了他们被胁迫或贩卖的传言。今年1月19日，建水县公安局宣布两人已回国，并因非法越境和参与电信网络诈骗被拘留。央视《法治在线》节目2月22日披露，两人在非法越境的全过程中均系独立行为，并未被胁迫进入电信诈骗园区。他们以诈骗中国男性为目标，每天诈骗约五六人。Ymoubing和Young Mumu都20岁，居住在云南省曲靖市沾益区。2022年7月，Ymoubing在网上看到高薪招聘背包客的广告，被5万至10万的佣金诱惑，便与Young Mumu一起计划出国。7月30日，两人在试图非法越境云南边境时被边防战士拦截并劝返。三天后，他们前往广西，非法越境进入越南，随后进入柬埔寨，被带到一个电信诈骗园区。虽然他们不能自由离开，但在园区内可以自由活动。他们并未被强制参与学习电信诈骗技术，而是针对中国男性，通过诱导支付会员费、激活费等方式进行诈骗。Ye Mobin（Ymoubing）承认自己有外债，害怕被抓，但仍想赚钱。8月，两人的父母前往广西寻找儿子。Ebbon（Ymoubing）的母亲也在网上寻求帮助，引起了关注。随后，网络赌博园区的管理层联系了两位家长，告知他们不能再待下去，必须回去。今年1月16日，两人被园区送至中越边境，试图越境，但被警方逮捕。在Mbbouran（Ymoubing）和Young Mumu被捕后，网上流传着各种传言。一种传言称，Ebbon在与母亲视频通话时做了一个“OK”手势，被解读为求救信号。Ye Mbourn（Ymoubing）表示，视频通话是在网络不佳的情况下进行的，没有特殊含义，只是正常地指着脸并触摸。另一张被频繁分享的截图声称，Ebbon在不同园区之间被转卖和殴打，并配有一张有多处伤痕的人的照片。Ymbin（Ymoubing）说他从未穿过那些衣服，照片是假的。公安机关调查发现，他从未被转卖。这也支持了许多前往东南亚网络赌博园区的人是出于自愿的观点。

### 债务追讨骗局与风险识别

最后，我们来看看近年来出现的“催收债务”骗局。近年来，社交媒体上充斥着声称能帮助催收欠款的广告，宣称能在短短三天内收回你无法收回的债务。一些担心坏账的债权人因此上钩，但在支付了数百至数万人民币后，不仅债务未能收回，而且发现无法再联系到这些公司。仅在某平台就有数十起此类投诉。一位投诉者表示，2025年11月，他与一家法律咨询公司签订了法律服务委托合同，该公司员工以法律顾问的身份，分五期收取了1.7万人民币的协调费和程序费，但2000元的欠款至今未收回。2020年，四川省公安厅发布通告提醒公众，所谓的法律咨询公司、律师事务所、维权中心通常是市场监管部门注册的有限责任公司。而律师事务所是公司注册处或民政部门注册的社会组织，持有的是执业许可证，并非律师专业执业证书，律师也不在这些公司工作。我们提醒大家，要通过核查相关数据，正确识别并防范风险。中国目前有57.4万家法律咨询公司，但只有4.5万家律师事务所。正常律师事务所为一个案件收费数千元，而这些法律咨询公司却只收取几百元，因为它们的目的不是办案，而是骗钱。其伎俩是先以咨询吸引债权人，然后虚假承诺能以几百元收回百分之百的欠款。收到钱后，他们会以超过诉讼时效、对方转移资产等理由再次收费，直到债权人突然意识到是骗局或完全被骗。曝光后，一些法律咨询公司经营困难，会花钱与律师事务所合作，利用公众对律所的信任来获取更多客户。而律师事务所由于竞争激烈，难以接到案子，有时甚至会主动联系法律咨询公司。自2024年以来，司法和公安部门已多次联合打击以律师名义进行的诈骗和虚假承诺行为。今年1月6日，武汉某软件园一家从事法律咨询和催收业务的公司约200人被捕。普通人如何识别催收骗局？首先，核查资质。大多数律师的资质可在全国律师专业信息公共服务平台查询，律师执业证书与法律咨询公司的“工作证”有显著区别。其次，律师和律师事务所不会做出绝对的承诺。对于大多数民间借贷纠纷，难点不在于诉讼，而在于执行，执行成功率不到10%。因此，任何承诺百分之百追回的说法都值得怀疑。第三，警惕收费方式。正规律师事务所会在授权前提供详细的收费明细，明确各项费用的用途和标准。而法律咨询公司往往收费条款模糊，以低价作为诱饵，随后进行一系列收费。好的，以上就是本期全部信息，周四再见。
