### 特朗普国情咨文概览

**Michael Bubaro**: 大家好，我是**Michael Bubaro**，来自《**纽约时报**》，这里是The Daily。今天，**特朗普总统**在其第二任期的首次**国情咨文**中，描绘了一个乐观的国家图景，尽管这个国家已经对他失去了信心，并且他不断挑衅**民主党**，而**民主党**正试图在今年秋天赢回国会控制权。我的同事，首席华盛顿记者**David Sanger**将带我们深入了解现场情况。今天是2月25日星期三。**David**，晚上好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: From the **New York Times**, I'm **Michael Bubaro**. This is The Daily. Today, in **President Trump**'s first **State of the Union** of his second term, he offered a rosy portrait of a country that has lost confidence in his leadership and relentlessly baited **Democrats** as they try to win back control of Congress this fall. My colleague, Chief Washington correspondent **David Sanger**, takes us inside the room. It's Wednesday, February 25th. **David**, good evening.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 嘿，**Michael**，我们又见面了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: Hey, **Michael**. We're back again.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 我们又见面了。这应该是你两天内的第二集了。现在是周二晚上11点半左右，总统刚刚结束了他的**国情咨文**演讲，那是一次非常漫长的**国情咨文**演讲。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: We're back again. This is your second episode, I think, in 2 days. It's about 11:30 p.m. on Tuesday night, and the president just wrapped his **State of the Union** address, and it was a very long **State of the Union** address.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 哦，是的，足足1小时47分钟。你知道，多年来，我们一直认为**比尔·克林顿**以99分钟创下了纪录，对吧？人们都不敢相信他如此冗长。但**唐纳德·特朗普**一直表现出他能讲得更久。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: Oh, yeah. It was an hour and 47 minutes. You know, for years, we thought that **Bill Clinton** set the record at 99 minutes, right? And people couldn't believe how verbose he was. But **Donald Trump** has shown consistently he can go longer.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 他确实讲得更久了。根据《**纽约时报**》的计算，这是历史上最长的**国情咨文**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: And he did go longer. This was the longest by **New York Times** calculations **State of the Union** in history.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: Yep.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: **David**，你很清楚，每一次**国情咨文**，无论长短，都深深植根于它发表的当下。我想从那里开始谈起，谈谈**特朗普总统**在周二晚上发表这次演讲时的利害关系。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: **David**, as you know well, every **State of the Union**, no matter its length, feels deeply grounded in the moment in which it is delivered. And I want to start there with you with the stakes of this speech for **President Trump** as we went into this speech on Tuesday night.

</details>

### 演讲的背景与挑战

**David Sanger**: 他有很多事情要做，因为一年前，他刚从一次大选胜利中走出来。人们有点厌倦了**拜登**时代。现在，他发表这次演讲时，民意调查显示选民对**特朗普总统**的态度相当严峻，超过60%的人表示他的优先事项不是他们的优先事项。他们担心可负担性和通货膨胀。他们担心关税，当**最高法院**似乎介入并表示总统越权时，他们感到有些宽慰。他们担心我们已将大部分海军和空军部署到**伊朗**海岸，这可能是一场人们仍然非常担忧的入侵。而且中期选举迫在眉睫，许多支持**特朗普总统**的**共和党**人坐在听众席上，非常紧张，担心到11月他们会面临什么。所以他今晚有很多障碍要跨越。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: He had a lot to get done because a year ago, he was coming in fresh from a big electoral victory. People were kind of tired of the **Biden** years. Now, he came into this one with polls showing that voters have turned on **President Trump** pretty severely, that more than 60% are saying that his priorities are not their priorities. They're concerned about affordability and **inflation**. They're worried about **tariffs** and were a little bit relieved when the **Supreme Court** seemed to step in and say the president overstepped his authority. They're concerned that we've put a good percentage of our navy and air force off the coast of **Iran** for what may be an invasion that people are still pretty apprehensive about. And there's a midterm election looming and a lot of very nervous **Republicans** who have backed **President Trump** sitting in that audience worried about what it is that they'll be stuck with come November. So he had a lot of hurdles to go across tonight.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 是的。我想说，美国人对经济极度焦虑，**中东**地区潜在的战火一触即发，一项对他不利的关税裁决，所有这些都发生在一个选举年，这使得这次**国情咨文**的利害关系达到了你所能想象的最高点。那么，当演讲开始时，请带我们进入现场。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Right. I would say that an economy Americans are extremely anxious about, a tinderbox potential war in the **Middle East**, a tariff ruling that went against him. All in an election year makes for about as high stakes a **State of the Union** as you can really imagine. So take us into the room as this speech gets underway.

</details>

**President Trump**: 议长先生，美利坚合众国总统。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 总统在惯常的介绍声中走进来，每一次介绍都引来一阵掌声。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: So the president walked in with the usual introductions, each one of which leads to a burst of applause.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 一些**民主党**人发出了抗议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: There are protests among some of the **Democrats**.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 但你知道，他立即化解了一个大问题，那就是他将如何处理他几天前谴责为不爱国的**最高法院**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: But you know, he immediately diffused the big issue which was how would he deal with the **Supreme Court** that he had denounced as unpatriotic just days before.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Right?

</details>

**David Sanger**: 他走上前去，与几位大法官握手，就是他几天前说他们的家人会为他们感到羞耻的那些人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: And he went up and shook the hands of a couple of the justices, the ones who he said a few days ago their families would be ashamed of them.

</details>

**President Trump**: 好的，非常感谢大家。这真是一种荣幸。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: Well, thank you very much everybody. It's really an honor.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 接着，在那短暂的出人意料的外交时刻之后，他走上讲台。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: And then after that brief moment of surprise diplomacy, he takes to the podium.

</details>

**President Trump**: 不到五个月后，我们国家将庆祝美国历史上一个史诗般的里程碑，我们光荣的美国独立250周年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: Less than five months from now, our country will celebrate an epic milestone in American history, the 250th anniversary of our glorious American independence.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 他确实这样做了。他一开口就提到了美国250周年纪念日。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: He does. And you know, he opens up with an immediate reference to the 250th anniversary of the United States.

</details>

**President Trump**: 今年7月4日，我们将迎来自由与胜利、进步与自由的两个半世纪，在一个地球上曾存在过的最不可思议、最卓越的国家。你们还没看到什么呢。我们会做得越来越好。这是美国的黄金时代。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: This July 4th, we will mark two and a half centuries of liberty and triumph, progress and freedom in the most incredible and exceptional nation ever to exist on the face of the earth. And you've seen nothing yet. We're going to do better and better and better. This is the golden age of America.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 我当时想了一会儿，他真的要在这里围绕这个主题发表一个团结的演讲。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: And I thought for a minute there, well, he's going to really go do a unifying speech here built around that theme.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 这是一个经历过革命阵痛、曾经有过分裂但最终团结起来的国家的主题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: The theme of a country that was in the throws of revolution, has had divisions before and came together.

</details>

**President Trump**: 12个月前，当我上次在这个议事厅讲话时，我刚刚继承了一个处于危机中的国家，经济停滞，通货膨胀达到创纪录水平，边境大开。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: When I last spoke in this chamber 12 months ago, I had just inherited a nation in crisis with a stagnant economy, **inflation** at record levels, a wide open border. It's not quite what we got.

</details>

**President Trump**: 国内犯罪猖獗，世界各地战火纷飞，一片混乱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: Rampid crime at home and wars and chaos all over the world.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 然后他开始了他的演讲，结果分成了三个部分。第一部分是他认为自己成就的熟悉回顾。中间部分是对**民主党**的高度党派攻击，最后部分则回归到这些团结的主题：250周年纪念日、战争英雄、一个无所不能的美国。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: And then he launched into what turned out to be a play in three parts. Right. The first part was a familiar recitation of what he thinks his accomplishments were. The middle was a highly partisan attack on **Democrats** and the end was sort of a return to these unifying themes. It's the 250th anniversary. War heroes, an America that can do anything it wants to do.

</details>

### 特朗普的政绩宣称

**Michael Bubaro**: 好的，那我们先从第一部分，**特朗普**的成就开始。在他的叙述中，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Okay. Well, let's start with the first of those, **Trump**'s accomplishments. In his telling,

</details>

**David Sanger**: 在他的叙述中，美国从基本上在急诊室里“到院即死”的状态中复苏了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: In his telling, America has come back from being basically dead on arrival in the emergency room.

</details>

**President Trump**: 但今晚，仅仅一年之后，我可以自豪而庄严地说，我们实现了一场前所未有的变革，一场划时代的转变。这确实是一场划时代的转变。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: But tonight, after just one year, I can say with dignity and pride that we have achieved a transformation like no one has ever seen before and a turnaround for the ages. It is indeed a turnaround for the ages.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 毫不奇怪，**Michael**，他列举了一些夸大的说法，对于任何在集会或新闻发布会上听过**唐纳德·特朗普**讲话的人来说，这些说法都相当熟悉。他声称“经济正在以前所未有的速度咆哮”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: And not surprisingly, **Michael**, he ran through a number of inflated claims that are pretty familiar to anybody who listens to **Donald Trump** at rallies or at press conferences. The roaring economy is roaring like never before.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 他谈到了经济增长。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: He talked about economic growth.

</details>

**President Trump**: 在我的政府下创造的所有就业机会中，100%都来自私营部门。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: And 100% of all jobs created under my administration have been in the private sector.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 他谈到了私营部门创造了多少就业机会，却没有提到政府部门削减了许多职位，而且总体就业增长相当低。他谈到了胜利，特别是赢得了对美国的新投资。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: He talked about how many jobs were created in the private sector without mentioning the fact that Doge cut many in the public sector and overall job growth is pretty low. He talked about winning, particularly winning new investment in the United States.

</details>

**President Trump**: 在12个月内，我获得了超过18万亿美元的承诺，这些资金从全球各地涌入。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: In 12 months, I secured commitments for more than $18 trillion pouring in from all over the globe.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 过去一年里，根本没有接近这个数字的资金流入。看起来他是在把来自不同首席执行官关于未来一二十年投资的承诺加起来，甚至可能夸大了这些承诺。最重要的是，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: Well, nothing close to that has come in in the past year. It looks like he is adding together and maybe inflating commitments that came from different chief executives talking about their investment over the next decade or two. And most importantly,

</details>

**President Trump**: 几个月来，我的政府已将核心通货膨胀率降至五年多来的最低水平。在2025年最后三个月，它降至1.7%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: Months, my administration has driven core **inflation** down to the lowest level in more than five years. And in the last three months of 2025, it was down to 1.7%.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 他提出了**通货膨胀**最终得到控制的论点。这是他最接近可负担性论点的地方，我们知道他讨厌提出这个论点，因为他认为这是一个荒谬的论点，但他的每一个助手都告诉他必须解决这个问题。这是民意调查显示让所有美国人都感到愤怒的一件事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: He made his case that **inflation** was finally under control. And that was the closest he got to the affordability argument that we know he hates making because he thinks it's a nonsense argument, but that every one of his aids tells him he's got to address. It's the one thing that the polls show anger Americans of all stripes.

</details>

**President Trump**: 不久前，我们还是一个死气沉沉的国家。现在，我们是世界上最热门的国家，最热门的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: A short time ago, we were a dead country. Now, we are the hottest country anywhere in the world. The hottest.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 真正令人震惊的是，如果你将他的主张与人们的感受，与他们告诉民意调查员的说法进行比较，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: What was really striking about this was if you compare his claims to the way people feel, what they tell pollsters,

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 这其中存在着一种不真实感。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: There was an element of unreality to this.

</details>

**President Trump**: 我们国家惊人的经济好转的主要原因之一，是历史上最大的一次，**道琼斯指数**提前四年突破50,000点，**标普指数**达到7,000点，而它本不应该在多年内达到这个水平。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: One of the primary reasons for our country's stunning economic turnaround, the biggest in history where the **Dow Jones** broke 50,000 four years ahead of schedule and the **S&P** hit 7,000 where it wasn't supposed to do it for many years.

</details>

**President Trump**: 是关税。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: Were **tariffs**.

</details>

### 关税裁决与行政权力

**Michael Bubaro**: **David**，大约在这个时候，**特朗普**正式转向了一个我们知道他需要解决的问题，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: And it's around this point, **David**, that **Trump** formally turns to a subject we knew he would need to address,

</details>

**David Sanger**: **最高法院**大法官的关税裁决。就像你说的，他走进来时和他们握了手，但后来在实际演讲中，他似乎又“收回”了他们的手。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: The **tariff** ruling by the **Supreme Court** justices. Like you said, he had shaken their hands as he walked in, but then it seemed like he kind of unshook their hands in the actual speech.

</details>

**President Trump**: 就在四天前，美国**最高法院**做出了一项不幸的裁决。它刚刚公布。这是一项非常不幸的裁决。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: And then just four days ago, an unfortunate ruling from the United States **Supreme Court**. It just came down. It came down. Very unfortunate ruling.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 我实际上认为，**Michael**，与他上周对那些裁决他不利的个别大法官提出具体指控相比，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: Well, I actually thought, **Michael**, that compared to what he said last week when he was making specific accusations against the individual justices who had ruled against him,

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 他已经相当温和了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: He was pretty moderate.

</details>

**President Trump**: 所以，尽管裁决令人失望，这些强大的、拯救国家的措施，它正在为我们国家节省我们正在收取的资金。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: So despite the disappointing ruling, these powerful country saving, it's saving our country the kind of money we're taking in.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 但这并没有持续多久。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: But this didn't last long.

</details>

**President Trump**: 国会行动将不必要。它已经经过时间考验和批准。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: Congressional action will not be necessary. It's already time-tested and approved.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 他基本上提出了这样的论点：我将根据不同的权力重新征收所有这些关税。然后他就继续了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: And he basically made the argument, I'm going to reimpose all of those **tariffs** under different authorities. And he moved on.

</details>

**President Trump**: 展望未来，工厂、就业、投资，以及数万亿美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: Moving forward, factories, jobs, investment, and trillions and trillions,

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 对吧？我确实认为值得注意的是，总统在表示他将重新征收关税时，说他觉得不需要国会采取行动。因为背景当然是，他身处一个坐满了国会议员的房间，理论上这些议员应该渴望能够影响这项决定。**最高法院**说这是他们的职责，而不是总统的。然而总统却看着所有这些国会议员，基本上说：“我不需要你们。我反正会这么做。”你知道，这是他整个总统任期的一个主题。这位总统早上醒来不会想着要通过国会的法案。这位总统早上醒来会想着他拥有或可以声称拥有哪些权力，以便他可以通过行政命令来做事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Right? I did think it was notable that the president when he said he was going to reimpose the **tariffs** said he didn't feel like he needed congressional action to do that because the context of course is that he's in a room filled with members of Congress who in theory should covet the ability to influence this decision. The **Supreme Court** said it's their job, not the president's. And instead the president looks at all these members of Congress and basically says, "I don't need you. I'm going to do this anyway." You know, that's a theme throughout his presidency. This is not a president who wakes up in the morning and thinks about bills he's going to go push through Congress. This is a president who wakes up in the morning and thinks about what authorities he has or can claim to have so that he can do things by executive order.

</details>

**President Trump**: 因为我们终于有了一位把美国放在第一位的总统。我把美国放在第一位。我爱美国。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: Because we finally have a president who puts America first. I put America first. I love America.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 然后总统转向了**David**你所称的演讲的第二幕，即党派之争。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: And then the president turns to what **David** you have termed the second act of this speech, the partisan act.

</details>

**President Trump**: 在我上任之前的几十年里，我们恰恰相反。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: For decades before I came along, we had the exact opposite.

</details>

### 移民问题上的党派攻击

**Michael Bubaro**: 特别是当他转向移民话题时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Especially as he turns to the topic of **immigration**.

</details>

**David Sanger**: **Michael**，如果你认为第一部分是由“好**唐纳德·特朗普**”发表的，那个看起来有点和蔼可亲的人，那么他一进入中间部分，语气就变了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: Well, you know, **Michael**, if you think that the first part was sort of delivered by the good **Donald Trump**, the one who seemed sort of jovial, the tone changed as soon as he got into this middle section.

</details>

**President Trump**: 在**拜登**和他在国会及其他地方的腐败伙伴的领导下，它达到了一个临界点，伴随着“绿色新骗局”，对所有人开放边境。他们成千上万地涌入，来自监狱，来自精神病院。他们被谋杀了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: Under **Biden** and his corrupt partners in Congress and beyond. It reached a breaking point with the **Green New Scam**, open borders for everyone. They poured in by the millions and millions from prisons, from mental institutions. They were murdered.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 他立即开始建立这种修辞主题，攻击**民主党**城市，并开始列举他现在熟悉的、他认为**民主党**给美国带来的弊病。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: He immediately goes into setting up this kind of rhetorical motif in which he attacks **Democratic** cities and he begins to run through his now familiar list of ills he thinks **Democrats** have brought to the United States.

</details>

**President Trump**: 但谈到正在掠夺美国的腐败，没有比**明尼苏达州**更令人震惊的例子了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: But when it comes to the corruption that is plundering really it's plundering America, there's been no more stunning example than **Minnesota**.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 所以他指责**明尼苏达州**的**索马里**人欺诈。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: So he blamed the **Somali** in **Minnesota** for fraud.

</details>

**President Trump**: 这是一种撕裂国家结构的腐败，我们正在以你难以置信的方式努力解决它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: This is the kind of corruption that shreds the fabric of a nation and we are working on it like you wouldn't believe.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 他抨击了**庇护城市**。他将自己的移民努力定义为“清除最坏分子”的努力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: He went after **sanctuary cities**. He defined his **immigration** effort as an effort to get the worst of the worst out.

</details>

**President Trump**: 我们正在迅速把他们赶出去。我们不想要他们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: And we're getting them the hell out of here fast. We don't want them.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 他很快就略过了其他没有犯罪记录但被驱逐出境的人，当然还有**明尼阿波利斯**两名美国公民被枪杀的事件。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: Skimming over right away others with no criminal record who have been deported and of course the shootings of two American citizens in **Minneapolis**.

</details>

**President Trump**: 现在，站在美国人和大开边境之间的唯一障碍就是**唐纳德·J·特朗普总统**和我们在国会中伟大的**共和党**爱国者。谢谢。谢谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: The only thing standing between Americans and a wide open border right now is **President Donald J. Trump** and our great **Republican** patriots in Congress. Thank you. Thank you.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 对。感觉他是在试图重新夺回移民这个话题，这个话题对他来说已经从优势变成了劣势。但在过程中，他并没有如实呈现他领导下实际发生的情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Right. It kind of felt like he was trying to reclaim the topic of **immigration**, which has gone from being a strength into being a vulnerability for him. But in the process, he did not represent what's actually unfolded under his leadership.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 但他有一个更深层次的目标，那就是设法让**民主党**人难堪，当然，当**共和党**人对这些事情鼓掌时，**民主党**人却坐着不动。**国情咨文**的一大好处是它让美国人有机会清楚地看到他们的代表真正相信什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: But he had a deeper goal here, which was to set up the **Democrats**, who of course were sitting on their hands while the **Republicans** were applauding each one of these. One of the great things about the **State of the Union** is how it gives Americans the chance to see clearly what their representatives really believe.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 然后，在某个时刻，在他达到高潮之后，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: And then at one point after he has built up to this crescendo.

</details>

**President Trump**: 所以今晚我邀请每一位立法者与我的政府一起重申一个基本原则。如果你同意这个声明，那么请站起来表达你的支持。美国政府的首要职责是保护美国公民，而不是非法外国人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: So tonight I'm inviting every legislature to join with my administration in reaffirming a fundamental principle. If you agree with this statement then stand up and show your support. The first duty of the American government is to protect American citizens, not illegal aliens.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 他要求所有同意他的人站起来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: He asks everyone to stand if they agree with him.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Mhm.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 他知道他会得到**共和党**人站着而**民主党**人坐着的画面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: Knowing that he would get the image of **Republicans** who are standing and **Democrats** who remain sitting.

</details>

**President Trump**: 这不是很可耻吗？你们不站起来应该感到羞耻。你们应该感到羞耻。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: Isn't that a shame? You should be ashamed of yourself not standing up. You should be ashamed of yourself.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 所以，如果你想捕捉**特朗普共和党**人和**民主党**人之间的分歧，**特朗普总统**就在那里为摄像机创造了这一刻。然后**民主党**人最终上钩了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: So if you ever wanted a moment where you could sort of capture the division between the **Trump Republicans** and the **Democrats**, **President Trump** was creating it right there for the cameras. And then eventually the **Democrats** take the bait.

</details>

**President Trump**: 结束保护罪犯的致命**庇护城市**，并对阻碍驱逐犯罪外国人的公职人员实施严厉惩罚。在许多情况下，他们是毒枭。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: To end deadly **sanctuary cities** that protect the criminals and enact serious penalties for public officials who block the removal of criminal aliens. In many cases, drug lords.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 毫不奇怪，他曾多次攻击的众议员**Ilhan Omar**开始对他大喊大叫，他也和她进行了几次交锋。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: And not surprisingly, Representative **Ilhan Omar**, who he has attacked repeatedly, begins yelling at him, and he has a few exchanges with her.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 对。在某个时候，她说：“你杀害了美国公民。”她想区分他所争论的非法移民问题，和她所说的真正问题，即你们这些家伙过于热心，正在伤害美国公民。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Right. At one point, she says, "You killed American citizens." She wants to distinguish between what he's arguing, which is there's a problem with illegal **immigration**, and what she says is the problem, which is you guys are so overzealous that you're hurting American citizens.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 对吧？这正是**特朗普总统**想要提出的对比。这是他想要的摄像机时刻，因为当叫喊声平息后，他所要表达的是一句话，这句话可能会成为人们记住这次演讲的唯一一句话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: Right? This was exactly the contrast that I think **President Trump** wanted to bring up. This was the moment he wanted for the cameras because what he was building toward once the yelling laid down was this one line that may remain as the one that people remember from the speech.

</details>

**President Trump**: 这些人疯了。我告诉你们，他们疯了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: These people are crazy. I'm telling you, they're crazy.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 这些人疯了。我告诉你们。当然，他把这看作是中期选举的主题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: These people are crazy. I'm telling you. And of course, he's thinking of that as the theme for the midterm elections,

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 对吧？他没有试图为他的政府在**明尼阿波利斯**等地的所有行为辩护，例如，**ICE**执法在那里已经成为他的一个真正负担。他试图扭转局面，让这成为**民主党**的负担。这是否会奏效尚不清楚，但他正在说他们仍然不符合主流。这不是关于我，这是关于他们在选举年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Right? Instead of trying to justify all of his administration's conduct in places like **Minneapolis**, for example, where **ICE** enforcement has become a real liability for him. He is attempting to turn this around and make it a liability for **Democrats**. It's deeply unclear whether that will work, but he's saying they remain out of the mainstream. This is not about me. This is about them in an election year.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 对，**Michael**。但这也是脱节再次出现的地方，因为民意调查会显示，美国人大多同情驱逐暴力、有犯罪记录的非法移民等想法。但当你谈到那些在美国生活了很长时间、没有犯罪记录、自己创业或学生之类的人时，这种同情心就会很快减弱。当你问及我们所看到的**ICE**执法活动，包括美国公民被杀害的事件时，这种同情心就会完全消失。而他处理最后一点的方式就是根本不提。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: That's right, **Michael**. But it's also where the disconnect shows up again because polls will show that Americans are largely sympathetic with the idea of throwing out illegal immigrants who are violent, who have criminal records, and so forth. It tapers off pretty fast when you have people who've been in the United States for a long time, no criminal record, built their own businesses or students or something like that. And it completely falls off when you ask about the **ICE** enforcement activity that we've seen take place, including the killings of American citizens. And the way he dealt with the last was simply not to mention it.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 好的，**David**，我们休息一下。回来后，我们将讨论总统如何通过外交事务最终进入演讲的第三幕。所以，我们马上回来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Okay, **David**, we're going to take a quick break. When we come back, we're going to talk about how the president eventually gets to that third act of this speech by way of a journey through foreign affairs. So, we'll be right back.

</details>

**President Trump**: 我们自豪地恢复了美国人在国内的安全，我们也在恢复美国人在国外的安全。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: We're proudly restoring safety for Americans at home and we are also restoring security for Americans abroad.

</details>

### 外交事务与国际角色

**Michael Bubaro**: **David**，演讲进行了一个小时左右，**特朗普总统**转向了国际事务，以及他如何结束了许多冲突，正如他所说。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: So **David**, about an hour into this speech, **President Trump** turns to international affairs and his role in bringing about the end to a whole lot of conflicts as he puts it.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 是的，没错，**Michael**，因为

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: Well, yes, that's right, **Michael**, because

</details>

**President Trump**: 我们的国家从未如此强大。在我上任的头10个月里，我结束了八场战争，包括，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: Our country has never been stronger. My first 10 months, I ended eight wars, including,

</details>

**David Sanger**: 当然，他重复了他“单枪匹马结束了八场战争”这个有些可疑的说法。其中有几场他可以居功，但重要的是**民主党**人对此嗤之以鼻。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: Of course, he repeats the somewhat dubious claim that he has single-handedly ended eight wars. There are a couple he can take credit for, but what's important here is the **Democrats** kind of laughed at him.

</details>

**President Trump**: 他们是病态的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: They're sick people.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 而**共和党**人则都为他鼓掌。然后他转向了显然是他最大的成功。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: And the **Republicans** all applauded him on it. He then turned to what was clearly his biggest success.

</details>

**President Trump**: 根据我谈判达成的停火协议，所有的人质，无论是生是死，都已返回家园。你能相信吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: Under the ceasefire I negotiated, every single hostage, both living and dead, has been returned home. Can you believe that?

</details>

**David Sanger**: 他谈到了那项协议，它让所有活着和死去的人质都从**哈马斯**手中被解救出来。那确实是一项了不起的成就。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: He talked about the agreement that brought all the hostages, living and dead, out of the hands of **Hamas**. That was a truly remarkable accomplishment.

</details>

**President Trump**: 没有人认为这可能。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: Nobody thought it was possible.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 然后他夸大了随后的停火，那次停火一直相当不稳定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: And then overstated the ceasefire that has followed, which has been pretty rocky.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Mhm.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 然后他只是轻描淡写地带过了四年前**国情咨文**的主导话题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: Then he just glided by what four years ago was the dominant subject of the **State of the Union**.

</details>

**President Trump**: 我们正在非常努力地结束第九场战争，即**俄罗斯**和**乌克兰**之间的杀戮和屠杀，那里每个月有25,000名士兵死亡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: And we're working very hard to end the ninth war, the killing and slaughter between **Russia** and **Ukraine**, where 25,000 soldiers are dying each and every month.

</details>

**David Sanger**: **俄罗斯**入侵**乌克兰**，这发生在他发表演讲的四年前的同一天。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: The **Russian** invasion of **Ukraine**, which happened four years to the day before this speech.

</details>

**President Trump**: 如果我是总统，这场战争永远不会发生。永远不会发生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: A war which would have never happened if I were president. Would have never happened.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 当**拜登总统**四年前在那里获得两党掌声，承诺无论如何都会支持**乌克兰**时，这次总统只是说他正在努力，伤亡惨重，他只想结束战争。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: And while **President Biden** was out there four years ago getting bipartisan applause for his promise to stick with **Ukraine** thick and thin, in this case, the president simply said he's working on it, that there have been awful casualties and he just wants to bring the war to an end.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 对吧？他坚决拒绝向**乌克兰**提供任何真正的支持，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Right? He steadfastly refused to offer any real support to **Ukraine**,

</details>

**David Sanger**: 这正是**乌克兰**人在今天，即四周年纪念日，所期待的一件事。仅仅是“我们与你们同在”的信息。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: Which was the one thing the **Ukrainians** were looking for today on the 4th anniversary. Just the message that we're with you.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Mhm.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 但他们没有得到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: And they didn't get it.

</details>

**President Trump**: 作为总统，我将在力所能及的地方实现和平，但我绝不会犹豫在必要时对抗对美国的威胁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: As president, I will make peace wherever I can, but I will never hesitate to confront threats to America wherever we must.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 然后总统转向了我们所有人都想知道他是否会提及的国际话题，以及如果他提及，他会多么彻底地探讨它，那就是**伊朗**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: And then the president pivots to the international subject that all of us were wondering whether he would get to and if he got to it how thoroughly he would broach it, which is **Iran**.

</details>

**President Trump**: 几十年来，美国政策一直是不允许**伊朗**获得核武器。许多几十年了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: For decades, it had been the policy of the United States never to allow **Iran** to obtain a nuclear weapon. Many decades.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 没错。我想说，这在某些方面是这次演讲中失去的机会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: That's right. And I'd say this was in some ways the lost opportunity of the speech.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 嗯。请解释一下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Hm. Just explain that.

</details>

### 伊朗政策的模糊性

**David Sanger**: 他如此迅速地带过了**伊朗**这个话题，以至于如果你是一个随便听听的人，你根本不会知道我们有大约三分之一的美国海军和大部分可用的美国空军力量部署在**中东**地区，而且在几天之内，我们很可能就会陷入与**伊朗**的持久冲突。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: Well, he brushed by the topic of **Iran** so quickly that if you were a casual listener, you would never have known that we've got something like a third of the US Navy and a good deal of the American air power that's available around the globe parked off the **Middle East** and that within a few days we could well be in a situation where we're in an enduring conflict with **Iran**.

</details>

**President Trump**: 他们被警告不得在未来尝试重建他们的武器计划，特别是核武器。然而他们继续。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: They were warned to make no future attempts to rebuild their weapons program in particular nuclear weapons. Yet they continue.

</details>

**President Trump**: 重新开始。我们已经将其清除，他们又想重新开始。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: Starting it all over. We wiped it out and they want to start all over again.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 所以他列举了**伊朗**多年来的罪行。他提出了他们可能试图重建核计划的可能性，这相当引人注目，因为八个月前，他说他已经摧毁了核计划，他们几年内都无法重启。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: So he ran through **Iran**'s offenses over the many years. He raised the possibility that they were trying to reconstitute their nuclear program, which was pretty remarkable because eight months ago, he was saying he obliterated the nuclear program and they wouldn't be able to restart it for years.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 对。在之前的袭击中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Right. In a previous attack.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 没错。那是在6月对三个主要浓缩设施的袭击中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: That's right. That was in the June attack on the three major enrichment sites.

</details>

**President Trump**: 他们已经开发出可以威胁欧洲和我们海外基地的导弹，他们正在努力建造很快就能抵达美利坚合众国的导弹。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: They've already developed missiles that can threaten Europe and our bases overseas, and they're working to build missiles that will soon reach the United States of America.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 他谈到了他们的导弹发展。他谈到了上个月起义期间被杀害的32,000名**伊朗**抗议者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: He talked about their missile developments. He talked about 32,000 **Iranian** protesters who had been killed during the uprisings last month.

</details>

**President Trump**: 我们以严重暴力的威胁阻止了他们中的许多人被绞死。但是，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: We stopped them from hanging a lot of them with the threat of serious violence. But this,

</details>

**David Sanger**: 但奇怪的是，**Michael**，他从未利用这个机会解释他试图用部署在**伊朗**附近的所有军事火力来实现什么？他是想阻止核计划，还是推翻政权，还是保护抗议者？他根本没有说。而这正是所有人最想听到的。他说**伊朗**人没有给他他想听的一句话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: But what was strange about this, **Michael**, was he never used the moment to explain what he was trying to accomplish with all of that military firepower sitting off of **Iran**? Was he trying to stop the nuclear program or overthrow the regime or protect the protesters? He simply did not say. And that's the one thing that everybody was listening for the most. He said the **Iranians** had not given him the one thing he wanted to hear.

</details>

**President Trump**: 与他。他们想达成协议，但我们没有听到那些秘密的话。我们永远不会拥有核武器。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: With him. They want to make a deal, but we haven't heard those secret words. We will never have a nuclear weapon.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 我们永远不会拥有核武器。当然，**伊朗**人已经说过很多次了。事实上，他们的外交部长在演讲前几个小时就发了推特。但问题不在于**伊朗**人说什么。而在于他们过去几年在不同时间被发现做了什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: We will never have a nuclear weapon. Well, of course, the **Iranians** have said that many times. In fact, their foreign minister tweeted it out a few hours before the speech. But the problem isn't what the **Iranians** say. It's what they've been caught doing at various points over the past few years.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 我不得不说，**David**，我对听到演讲的这一部分有稍微不同的反应，我几乎从不与你意见相左，但我听到的感觉是总统在表达他对**伊朗**的厌恶时，提出了一个“以上皆是”的理由。总而言之，这确实感觉像是对**伊朗**采取军事行动的理由的开端。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: I have to say, **David**, I had a slightly different reaction to hearing this section of the speech, and I almost never differ with you, but I heard what felt like a all the above rationale from the president in stating his disgust with **Iran**. And taken together, it did feel like the beginning of a rationale for military action against **Iran**.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 他提出了一个或实际上四五个原因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: He came up with a cause of spell or actually four or five.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Mhm.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 但他从未告诉我们军事力量的应用，轰炸**伊朗**人将如何改变这一切。正如我们之前谈到的，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: But he never told us how the application of military power, how bombing the **Iranians** would change this. And as we've talked about before,

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 你知道，你可能能够摧毁一些设施，但通过投掷炸弹如何保护抗议者尚不清楚。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: You know, you might be able to destroy some facilities, but it's not clear how you protect protesters, for example, by dropping bombs in.

</details>

**President Trump**: 我们还在西半球恢复美国的**安全**和主导地位，采取行动维护我们的国家利益。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: We're also restoring American security and dominance in the Western Hemisphere, acting to secure our national interest.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 有趣的是，至少对我来说，总统选择将他对**伊朗**的含蓄威胁与他对**委内瑞拉**已经非常明确的行动并置。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: It's interesting, at least it was to me, that the president chose to juxtapose his implicit threats against **Iran** with his already very explicit actions against **Venezuela**.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: That's right.

</details>

**President Trump**: 美国的武装部队压倒了所有防御，彻底击败了敌人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: And America's armed forces overwhelmed all defenses and utterly defeated a enemy.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 他谈到了那次行动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: He talked about that operation.

</details>

**President Trump**: 这对美国的**安全**来说是一次绝对巨大的胜利，它也为**委内瑞拉**人民开启了一个崭新的开始。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: And this was an absolutely colossal victory for the security of the United States and it also opens up a bright new beginning for the people of **Venezuela**.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 然后他把**首席准尉5级Eric Slover**带进了大厅。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: He then brings into the hall **chief warrant officer 5 Eric Slover**.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 这位直升机飞行员曾参与**马杜罗**突袭行动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: The helicopter pilot who was part of the **Maduro raid**.

</details>

**President Trump**: 在准备降落时，敌人的机枪从四面八方开火，**Eric**的腿和臀部受了重伤，一发又一发的子弹他都承受了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: While preparing to land enemy machine guns fired from every angle and **Eric** was hit very badly in the leg and hip one bullet after another he absorbed.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 他承受了难以置信的火力，腿部粉碎。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: And who took incredible amounts of fire his leg was shattered.

</details>

**President Trump**: 然后，即使他鲜血直流，血流到了过道上。直升机以陡峭的角度降落。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: Then even as he was gushing blood which was flowing back down the aisle. Helicopter lands at a steep angle.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 尽管他流血不止，他还是降落了直升机。总统以某种血腥的细节描述了这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: He lands the helicopter despite the fact that he's bleeding. And the president describes this in somewhat gory detail.

</details>

**President Trump**: 所以，我们为**Eric**和**Amy**准备了一个惊喜，以表彰**Eric**超越职责范围的行动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: So, we have a surprise for **Eric** and **Amy** in recognition of **Eric**'s actions above and beyond the call of duty.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 然后，当然，他们当着国会所有人和所有观众的面，当场授予这位飞行员**荣誉勋章**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: And then of course they give the pilot the **Medal of Honor** right there in front of all of Congress and everybody who's watching.

</details>

**President Trump**: 凭借我们国家最高的军事奖项，国会**荣誉勋章**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: With our nation's highest military award, the Congressional **Medal of Honor**.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 所以那是一个有点巧妙的转折，因为**民主党**人怎么能不为授予这样一位勇敢的人奖章而起立呢？当他为一些百岁老兵颁发类似奖项时，他们又怎么能不站起来呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: So that was a little bit of a brilliant turn because how could the **Democrats** not stand for the awarding of a medal to somebody that courageous? And how could they not stand when he did similar awards for elderly veterans, some 100 years old?

</details>

**President Trump**: 海军战斗机飞行员**Royce Williams**曾服役于**第二次世界大战**、**朝鲜战争**、**越南战争**，执行了220多次任务。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: Navy fighter pilot **Royce Williams** served in **World War II**, **Korea**, **Vietnam**, flying more than 220 missions.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 他曾参加过**第二次世界大战**、**朝鲜战争**和**越南战争**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Who had fought in **World War II** and **Korea** and **Vietnam**.

</details>

**President Trump**: 但今晚，这位100岁的勇敢海军上尉终于得到了他应得的认可。他被指控。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: But tonight at 100 years old, this brave Navy captain is finally getting the recognition he deserves. He was alleged.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 所以在那一刻，他将自己的军事倾向与对伟大英雄主义的颂扬结合起来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: So at that moment, he sort of matched his marshall tendencies with a celebration of great heroism.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: **David**，我很好奇，作为**国情咨文**的老兵，以及曾经报道军事事务的人，你如何看待总统在这次演讲中颁发的所有军事奖项。我倾向于认为这些奖项通常是在庄重、更私密的仪式上颁发的。这是最公开的场合，总统的**国情咨文**，因此带有一点党派色彩。颁发了**紫心勋章**。颁发了国会**荣誉勋章**。这究竟是在颂扬美国英雄主义，还是在某种程度上利用它？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: I'm curious, **David**, as a veteran of **State of the Union**s and also as someone who's covered military affairs in your day, how you thought about all of the military awards that the president bestowed during this speech. I tend to think of those as awards typically given in solemn, much more intimate ceremonies. This is the most public possible venue. A president's **State of the Union** and thus has a bit of a partisan tinge. A **Purple Heart** was given out. Congressional **Medals of Honor** were given out. Was that celebrating American heroism or was that in some ways exploiting it?

</details>

**David Sanger**: 我认为这既有表演的成分，也有利用的成分，因为他正在将这些人在正义战争中的经历，例如**第二次世界大战**，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: I think there was an element of showmanship and an element of exploitation to it as well because what he was doing was combining the experiences of these people in just wars, **World War II**, you know, and so forth,

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: **朝鲜战争**，我们为民主而战。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: **Korea**, where we were fighting for a nent democracy,

</details>

**David Sanger**: 并试图将其与许多人认为不那么明确的美国权力使用，甚至可能是非法的行为融合在一起。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: And managing to try to merge that with what many would argue were less clear uses of American power potentially even illegal.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 而且可能是非法的，如果他继续下去，我们肯定会就**伊朗**问题展开辩论。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: And potentially illegal and we're headed to that debate about **Iran** for sure if he went ahead.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 所以这有点像借鉴了**罗纳德·里根**在**国情咨文**听众席上安排杰出嘉宾和英雄的想法，并将其提升到新的水平，在整个国会面前授予他们这些奖章。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: So this is sort of taking the **Ronald Reagan** idea of putting prominent guests and heroes in the **State of the Union** audience and moving it to the next level by awarding them these medals in front of the entire congress.

</details>

### 寻求团结的第三幕

**Michael Bubaro**: **David**，请带我们到演讲的结尾，第三幕，**特朗普总统**试图实现团结。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: So **David**, take us to the end of this speech. The third act when **President Trump** takes a stab at unity.

</details>

**David Sanger**: **Michael**，第三幕，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: Well, **Michael**, the third act,

</details>

**President Trump**: 250年对于一个国家的生命来说是很长的时间。但在另一个意义上，它在历史的眼中只是一个瞬间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: 250 years is a long time in the life of a nation. But in another sense, it's really a mere moment in the eye of history.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 他提到了美国250周年纪念日。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: Picked up on the 250th anniversary of America.

</details>

**President Trump**: 我们国家所做的一切，我们所取得的一切成就，都是那些少数伟大生命的工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: Everything our nation has done, everything we have achieved has been the work of those few great lifetimes.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 所以他把美国说成是一个年轻的国家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: So he talked about America as a young nation.

</details>

**President Trump**: 美国人以铝和钢的翅膀，将人类带入天空。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: Americans lifted humanity into the skies on the wings of aluminum and steel.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 然后他把美国说成是一个创新的国家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: Then he talked about America as an innovative nation.

</details>

**President Trump**: 所有这一切以及更多，都是那些建设和保卫这个国家，并仍然肩负着全人类希望和自由的勤劳爱国者的不朽遗产，无与伦比的荣耀。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: All of this and so much more is the enduring legacy, unmatched glory of the hardworking patriots who built and defended this country and who still carry the hopes and freedoms on all of humanity's backs.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 然后他把美国人说成是永远不会被打败的人，他们的思想和精神得以延续，可以在世界上做任何事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: Then he talked about Americans as people who could never be defeated, whose ideas and spirit sort of carried through and could do anything in the world.

</details>

**President Trump**: 没有美国人无法克服的挑战，没有我们无法征服的广阔边疆，没有我们无法追逐的宏伟梦想，没有我们无法企及的遥远地平线。因为我们的命运是由天意之手书写的，而这最初的250年只是一个开始。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: There is no challenge Americans cannot overcome, no frontier too vast for us to conquer, no dream too bold for us to chase, no horizon too distant for us to claim. For our destiny is written by the hand of providence and these first 250 years were just the beginning.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 这听起来像谁？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Who did that sound like?

</details>

**David Sanger**: **乔·拜登**，他过去在每次演讲中都会说：

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: **Joe Biden** who used to say at every speech,

</details>

**President Trump**: 没有美国人不能完成的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: There's nothing Americans can't accomplish.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 在某些方面，这不像**唐纳德·特朗普**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: And in some ways it was not like **Donald Trump**,

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 但他带着某种激情发表了这番话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: But he delivered it with some passion.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 这让你意识到他内心深处，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: And it made you realize that he has within him.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 拥有以团结的措辞讲话的能力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: The ability to talk in unifying terms.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 他就是忍不住。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: He just can't help himself.

</details>

**President Trump**: 我们的未来将比以往任何时候都更宏大、更美好、更光明、更大胆、更辉煌。谢谢你们。上帝保佑你们，上帝保佑美国。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**President Trump**: And our future will be bigger, better, brighter, bolder, and more glorious than ever before. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 所以最后，回想这一切的利害关系，在这个经济时刻，在这个国家的移民斗争时刻，以及潜在的新战争开始之际，他是否抓住了这个时机？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: So in the end, thinking back to the stakes of this all, at this moment in the economy, at this moment in the **immigration** battles in the country and potentially at the start of a new war, did he meet the moment?

</details>

### 演讲影响评估与民主党回应

**David Sanger**: **Michael**，我认为他没有改变局面。他必须在这次演讲中说服美国人，证据表明他们不需要感到经济不安全。我认为他没有做到这一点。他必须提出一个理由，说明我们为什么可能在未来几天内开战。他当然没有做到这一点。他必须证明**共和党**有一个完整的政策议程，准备在中期选举之前实施。而这次演讲中几乎没有政策内容。所以我的总体感觉是，**特朗普总统**谈论的是他认为国家应该如何看待他，而不是国家实际如何看待他。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: You know, I don't think, **Michael**, that he moved the needle. He had to go convince Americans in this speech that the evidence indicated that they didn't need to feel this economically insecure. I don't think he met that. He had to go lay out a rationale for why we may be at war in the next couple of days. He certainly didn't do that. He had to go make the case that the **Republican** party had a full policy agenda that was ready to go between now and the midterm elections. And there was very little policy in this speech. So my overall sense is **President Trump** talked about how he believes the country should view him rather than how it does view him.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 这就引出了一个问题，他是否与国家其他部分保持一致。好的，**David**，现在快凌晨1点了。你该睡觉了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: And that raised the question of whether or not he is yet in tune with the rest of the nation. Well, **David**, it is now almost 1:00 a.m. It's time for you to go to bed.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 确实如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: It certainly is.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 非常感谢你。很感谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

</details>

**David Sanger**: 非常感谢，**Michael**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sanger**: Thanks much, **Michael**.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: **特朗普总统**演讲后不久，新当选的**弗吉尼亚州**州长**Abigail Spanberger**发表了**民主党**的回应。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Shortly after **President Trump**'s speech, the newly elected governor of **Virginia**, **Abigail Spanberger**, delivered the **Democratic** party's rebuttal.

</details>

**Abigail Spanberger**: 你必须问，谁从他的言辞、政策、行动中受益，他通过这个**共和党**国会推动的法律清单很短。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Abigail Spanberger**: You have to ask, who benefits from his rhetoric, his policies, his actions, the short list of laws he's pushed through this **Republican** Congress.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: **Spanberger**将总统描绘成一个自私自利的自大狂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: **Spanberger** portrayed the president as a selfdeing egoomaniac.

</details>

**Abigail Spanberger**: 肯定有人受益。他正在为自己、家人和朋友谋取私利。腐败的规模是前所未有的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Abigail Spanberger**: Somebody must be benefiting. He's enriching himself, his family, his friends. The scale of the corruption is unprecedented.

</details>

**Abigail Spanberger**: 讨好外国王子以获得飞机，讨好亿万富翁以获得宴会厅，将自己的名字和面孔印在我们国家首都的所有建筑物上。这不是我们的开国元勋所设想的。远非如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Abigail Spanberger**: Cozying up to foreign princes for airplanes and billionaires for ballrooms, putting his name and face on buildings all over our nation's capital. This is not what our founders envisioned. Not by a long shot.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 她说，归根结底，总统和他的议程都与普通美国人严重脱节。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: And said that at the end of the day, both the president and his agenda are deeply out of touch with regular Americans.

</details>

**Abigail Spanberger**: 总统在为你工作吗？我们都知道答案是否定的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Abigail Spanberger**: Is the president working for you? We all know the answer is no.

</details>

**Michael Bubaro**: 我们马上回来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: We'll be right back.

### 其他新闻

**Michael Bubaro**: 以下是您今天还需要了解的其他信息。周二，众议院**共和党**人否决了一项法案，联邦监管机构称该法案可以防止致命的空中相撞，就像去年在华盛顿特区发生的那起导致67人死亡的事故。该法案要求飞机携带先进的位置跟踪技术，最初得到国防部的支持，并于12月获得参议院通过。但国防部此后撤回了支持，理由是担心国家**安全**和成本。这促使足够多的众议院**共和党**人投票反对该法案，从而阻止其通过。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Bubaro**: Here's what else you need to know today. On Tuesday, House **Republicans** voted down a bill that federal regulators said could prevent deadly midair collisions like the one last year in Washington DC that killed 67 people. The bill, which would have required planes to carry advanced location tracking technology, was originally endorsed by the Defense Department and adopted by the Senate in December. But the Defense Department has since withdrawn its support, citing concerns over national security and costs. That prompted just enough House **Republicans** to vote against the bill to block its passage.

</details>
