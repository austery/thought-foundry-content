### 移民执法射击事件争议

**Tracy Mumford**: 来自《纽约时报》，这是今日头条。我是 Tracy Mumford。今天，星期二，2月10日。我们正在报道以下内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Tuesday, February 10th. Here's what we're covering.

</details>

**Reporter**: 你可以看到驾驶员侧车门和乘客座位上的弹孔。开枪的警官是...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> You can see the bullet holes on the driver's side door and the passenger seat. The agent who opened fire was

</details>

**Reporter**: 在过去一年里，联邦移民执法人员在巡逻美国城镇时发生了 16 起枪击事件。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> Over the past year, there have been 16 shootings by federal immigration agents as they've been patrolling US cities and towns.

</details>

**Reporter**: 警方称，Brown 试图逃跑。在许多此类事件中，政府立即声称被枪击者应负全责。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> Police say Brown attempted to flee. In many of those, the government has immediately stated that the people who were shot at were to blame.

</details>

**Reporter**: **国土安全部**称，他用汽车撞了两名边境保护官员。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> Homeland Security says he struck two border protection officers with his car.

</details>

**Reporter**: **国土安全部**指控 Martinez 袭击，称她为国内恐怖分子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> Homeland Security accused Martinez of assault, labeling her as a domestic terrorist.

</details>

**Reporter**: 联邦调查人员指控 Buddus 在试图逃避逮捕时，将他的汽车用作武器。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> The feds accused Buddus of using his car as a weapon as he allegedly tried to escape arrest.

</details>

**Reporter**: 在 **Renee Good** 和 **Alex Prey** 的备受瞩目案件中，大量旁观者视频削弱了政府的说辞。而现在，《纽约时报》的审查显示，在其他一些案件中，政府的说法在法庭上已土崩瓦解。例如，10 月份在华盛顿特区，一名警官向一名坐在车里的男子开枪。**DHS** 的一位女发言人说，他试图开车冲撞警官，该男子被指控犯有重罪。然而，一名法官发现政府未能提供任何证据，并表示该警官开枪，“原因对我来说完全不清楚”。在芝加哥，政府指控一名女子袭击了一辆由移民执法人员驾驶的 SUV。撞车后，一名警官向该女子开了数枪。今年秋天，在更多证据浮出水面后，包括那名警官在一组发给其他警官的短信中吹嘘枪击事件，写道：“我开了五枪，她身上有七个洞。记住了，伙计们。”检方放弃了对她的指控。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> In the high-profile cases of Renee Good and Alex Prey, a barrage of bystander video undercut the government's narrative. And now a Times review shows how in some of the other cases, the government's claims have been falling apart in court. For example, in October in DC, an agent shot at a man in his car. A DHS spokeswoman said he tried to run officers down and the man was charged with a felony. A judge, however, found the government failed to present any evidence of that and said the agent had fired, quote, for reasons that are completely unclear to me. And in Chicago, the government charged a woman with assault for hitting an SUV driven by immigration agents. After the crash, an agent shot the woman multiple times. This fall, prosecutors abandoned the case against her after more evidence came to light, including that the officer bragged about the shooting in a group text to other agents, writing, "I fired five rounds and she had seven holes. Put that in your book, boys."

</details>

**Reporter**: 全国范围内，有四起类似案件，检方对被警官开枪射击的人提起了诉讼，但当证据不支持政府的初步说法时，这些案件都逐渐不了了之。**DHS** 的一位女发言人在回应提问时，坚持了她和该机构过去发表的声明，指责被警官枪击的人，并表示，“联邦执法官员正面临一场高度协调的暴力活动。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: Across the country, four cases like this where prosecutors brought charges against the people agents fired at have fizzled out when evidence didn't support the administration's initial claims. In response to questions, a DHS spokeswoman stood by past statements she and the agency have made blaming people shot by agents and said, quote, "Federal law enforcement officials are facing a highly coordinated campaign of violence against them.

### 马克斯韦尔拒绝作证

**Tracy Mumford**: 现在，来自华盛顿的另外两个快速更新。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Now, two other quick updates from Washington.

</details>

**Reporter**: 好的，我们开始记录。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> All right, we'll go on the record.

</details>

**Reporter**: 在国会山，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> On Capitol Hill,

</details>

**Reporter**: 请证人陈述姓名并拼写您的姓氏以供记录？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> can the witness please state her name and spell her last name for the record?

</details>

**Reporter**: Gilen Noel Marian Maxwell，M-A-X-W-E-L-L。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> Gilen Noel Marian Maxwell, M-A-X-W-E-L-L.

</details>

**Reporter**: **吉斯兰·马克斯韦尔**，**杰弗里·爱泼斯坦**的长期伴侣，因性交易被判处联邦刑期，她通过监狱的视频连线出现在众议院监督委员会面前。作为其爱泼斯坦调查的一部分，该委员会花了数月时间试图讯问马克斯韦尔。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> Gain Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's longtime companion who's serving a federal sentence for sex trafficking, appeared by video link from prison for a deposition in front of the House Oversight Committee. The committee had spent months trying to depose Maxwell as part of its Epstein investigation.

</details>

**Reporter**: 你是否知道**唐纳德·特朗普**曾与你或**杰弗里·爱泼斯坦**介绍过的人发生过性关系？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> Are you aware of Donald Trump ever engaging in sexual activity with an individual introduced to him by you or Jeffrey Epstein?

</details>

**Reporter**: 我援引我的**第五修正案**的沉默权。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> I invoke my fifth amendment right to silence.

</details>

**Reporter**: 但昨天，马克斯韦尔拒绝回答任何问题。她的律师暗示，只有在一种情况下，她的立场才会改变。如果该委员会和美国公众真的想听到关于所发生事件的 unfiltered 事实，那么有一条直接的途径。如果**特朗普总统**给予特赦，马克斯韦尔女士就准备好充分而诚实地发言了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> But yesterday, Maxwell refused to answer any questions. A stance her lawyer suggested would only change under one condition. If this committee and the American public truly want to hear the unfiltered truth about what happened, there is a straightforward path. Miss Maxwell is prepared to speak fully and honestly if granted clemency by President Trump.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: **特朗普政府**如何对待马克斯韦尔一直受到越来越多的审查。去年，在她会见**特朗普**的副总检察长几天后，她被转移到一个最低安全级别的监狱。民主党议员表示，已有十多人站出来提出举报人投诉，称马克斯韦尔在那里受到优待，例如可以不受监督地使用笔记本电脑，并获得瓶装水。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: How the Trump administration has treated Maxwell has come under increasing scrutiny. She was moved to a minimum security prison last year, days after she met with Trump's deputy attorney general. And Democratic lawmakers say that more than a dozen people have come forward with whistleblower complaints, saying Maxwell is getting preferential treatment there, like unsupervised access to a laptop and being given bottled water.

</details>

### 削减公共卫生资金

**Tracy Mumford**: 而根据《纽约时报》审查的文件，**白宫**计划从本周开始削减向四个由民主党领导的州提供的 **6000 万美元**公共卫生资金。**加利福尼亚州**、**科罗拉多州**、**伊利诺伊州**和**明尼苏达州**的计划都将受到影响，例如芝加哥一项旨在增加对非裔女性的 **HIV 预防疗法**的努力，以及旧金山一项旨在减少 **LGBTQ 老年人**的社会孤立的项目。**卫生与公众服务部**的一位发言人表示，这些拨款被终止是因为它们不符合该部门的优先事项。联邦卫生官员最近修改了他们公开声明的优先事项，表示他们正从关注主要影响少数族裔的疾病转向其他方面，称这项努力“常常破坏了核心的美国价值观”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And according to documents reviewed by the Times, the White House plans to slash $600 million in public health funds to four states led by Democrats starting this week. California, Colorado, Illinois, and Minnesota will all have programs affected, like an effort in Chicago to increase HIV prevention therapy among black women, and a project in San Francisco to reduce social isolation among LGBTQ seniors. A spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services said the grants are being terminated because they don't reflect the AY's priorities. Federal health officials recently revised their publicly stated priorities, saying they're moving away from focusing on diseases that predominantly affect minority populations, saying that effort has often quote undermined core American values.

### 德州反穆言论升级

**Tracy Mumford**: 在德克萨斯州，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: In Texas,

</details>

**Reporter**: “腐败的 Ken Paxton 对激进伊斯兰教软弱无力。”《纽约时报》一直在报道，在德州激烈的初选季中，共和党官员和候选人如何大幅升级反穆斯林言论。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> crooked Ken Paxton is soft on radical Islam. The Times has been covering how Republican officials and candidates are dramatically ramping up anti-Muslim rhetoric in the state's heated primary election season.

</details>

**Reporter**: “激进伊斯兰教是一种嗜血的意识形态。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> Radical Islam is a bloodthirsty ideology.

</details>

**Reporter**: 近年来，政客们通过谈论边境，警告移民车队之类的事情来煽动选民。但随着边境口岸的下降，这已不再是一个有共鸣的问题，现在他们越来越关注**伊斯兰教**。“停止**沙里亚法**，德州。”德州总检察长竞选的 Maize Middleton。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> In recent years, politicians had whipped up voters by talking about the border, warning about things like migrant caravans. But that's become less of a resonant issue as border crossings have plummeted and now they're increasingly focused on Islam. >> And stop Sharia law, Texas. Maize Middleton for Texas Attorney General.

</details>

**Reporter**: “那么我有一个问题是，你知道是什么在推动德州发生这种情况，而且州里发生的一个重大转变是，嗯，这个州已经成为穆斯林移居美国的一个真正中心。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> So the question that I had was you know what's driving this in Texas and and a major shift that has happened in the state is that uh the state has become a real hub for Muslims moving to the United States.

</details>

**Reporter**: **David Goodman** 是《纽约时报》德州分社社长。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> David Goodman is the Times Texas bureau chief.

</details>

**Reporter**: “在**达拉斯**和**沃斯堡**以外的地区，以及北德州那个区域的郊区，穆斯林人口真的在蓬勃发展，他们看到穆斯林居民的数量急剧增加。来自世界各地的人，但特别是来自**南亚**。所以是**巴基斯坦**、**印度**。我当时和那里的几个协会谈过，他们说他们以前可能只有几十个清真寺。现在已经超过 100 个了。所以至少对于一些选民来说，你知道，特别是基督教保守派共和党选民，他们看到这种人口变化，并认为这是对他们生活方式的威胁。所以他们告诉候选人和民意调查员，这是他们在此次选举中的首要关切之一。你知道，德州之所以成为许多穆斯林现在居住的地方，有一个非常简单的原因。那是因为这是一个他们感觉可以拥有一个社区、一个宗教社区，并且或多或少可以自由地实践其信仰的地方，就像，你知道，许多基督徒在德州所做的那样，并且已经利用了几代人的时间。他们真的觉得，那种德州承诺的更大的自由，是把许多人带到这里的。现在有很多恐惧和很多沮丧。你知道，德州穆斯林非常担心，很多这种言论来自政府的最高层。是州长，是总检察长，是州领导人，你知道，他们确实在煽动很多这种情绪，而不是试图平息它。这让他们对这个州的未来非常担忧。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> There's a really booming population particularly outside of Dallas and Fort Worth and in the suburbs in that area of North Texas they've just seen a massive increase in the number of Muslim residents. People coming from all over the world but particularly South Asia. So Pakistan, India, I was talking to some associations up there and they said they used to have, you know, maybe a couple dozen mosques in the area. Now they're up over 100. So at least for you know some number of voters, you know, particularly Christian conservative Republican voters, they're looking at this changing population and seeing it as a threat to their way of life. And so they are telling candidates and telling pollsters that this is one of their top concerns in this election. You know, there's a real simple reason why Texas has become a place where lots of Muslims now live. And it's because it's a place where they felt like you could have a community, a religious community that was more or less left alone to practice its faith, much like, you know, many Christians do in in Texas and have taken advantage of for, you know, for generations. And they really just felt like the kind of the general Texas promise of of greater freedom was what brought many of them here. And and now there's a lot of fear and a lot of frustration. You know, Muslims in Texas are really concerned that a lot of this rhetoric is coming from the very top of the government. It's the governor, it's the attorney general, it's it's state leaders, you know, who are really fanning the flames of a lot of the sentiment rather than trying to tamp it down. And that's made them very worried about the future in the state.

### 以色列与西岸局势

**Tracy Mumford**: 在以色列，政府已采取单方面措施以加强对**约旦河西岸**的控制，此举被广泛认为违反了**国际法**。这些变化部分围绕着让**犹太定居者**更容易在那里购买更多土地。在宣布新措施时，一位以色列高级官员表示：“我们正在深化我们在以色列土地所有地区的根基，并埋葬建立巴勒斯坦国的想法。”这是以色列不断升级的企图夺取更多约旦河西岸土地的最新一步。最近的军事行动导致了当地巴勒斯坦人的大规模流离失所，这是自 **1960s** 年代以来从未有过的。暴力事件也创下新高，因为犹太定居者对巴勒斯坦人及其财产发动了数百次袭击。专家表示，以色列的最新举措明显违反了该国几十年前签署的协议。昨天，该地区八个国家发表声明，指责以色列非法吞并。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: In Israel, the government has taken unilateral steps to get more control over the West Bank, a move that's widely considered to be a violation of international law. The changes revolve in part around making it easier for Jewish settlers to buy more land there. In announcing the new measures, a top Israeli official said, quote, "We are deepening our roots in all parts of the land of Israel and burying the idea of a Palestinian state." It's the latest step in Israel's escalating effort to seize more of the West Bank. Recent military operations have led to the massive displacement of Palestinians there, more than at any time since the 1960s. And there's been record high violence as Jewish settlers have carried out hundreds of attacks on Palestinians and their property. Experts say Israel's latest steps are a clear violation of agreements the country signed decades ago. And yesterday, a group of eight countries in the region released a statement accusing Israel of illegal annexation.

</details>

**Reporter**: “我们呼吁国际社会，包括特朗普先生，停止以色列在...的行为。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> We call on the international community, including to Mr. Trump, to stop what Israel is doing in the

</details>

**Reporter**: 巴勒斯坦权力机构的一位官员敦促美国介入，因为**特朗普总统**明确告诉以色列不要吞并约旦河西岸。特朗普定于明天在华盛顿与以色列总理**本雅明·内塔尼亚胡**会面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> An official from the Palestinian Authority has urged the US to step in as President Trump has explicitly told Israel not to annex the West Bank. Trump is set to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tomorrow in Washington.

</details>

### 奥运奖牌问题

**Tracy Mumford**: 最后，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And finally,

</details>

**Reporter**: ...还有**奥运会**的丝带。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> and there's the ribbon >> at the Olympics.

</details>

**Reporter**: 这是应该放在丝带里固定它的金属片。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> And here's the little piece that is supposed to go in the ribbon to hold it in the metal. And

</details>

**Reporter**: 美国高山滑雪运动员 **Breezy Johnson** 对其他获胜者有一个小小的提醒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> American Alpine skier Breezy Johnson had a little PSA for other winners.

</details>

**Reporter**: “别跳了。我兴奋地跳起来，结果它断了。”“小心你们的奖牌，因为它们开始散开了，有点坏了。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> Don't Don't jump in them. I was jumping in excitement and it broke. >> Be careful with your medals because they are coming apart. a little broken.

</details>

**Reporter**: Johnson 的金牌从丝带上掉了下来。美国花样滑冰运动员 **Alysa Leuse** 也是如此。德国**雪车队**庆祝的视频也显示了同样的情况。如果你为喜悦而跳，你的奖牌可能会断裂掉到地上。奥运组织者正在努力解决这个问题，他们说：“显然，这是我们希望做到完美的事情。”但意大利别太难过。2024 年**巴黎奥运会**的 100 多名运动员要求更换他们的奖牌，因为这些奖牌开始出现碎裂和剥落，一位游泳运动员将他的奖牌外观比作“鳄鱼皮”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter**: >> Johnson's gold medal came off its ribbon. US figure skater Alysa Leuse did, too. And footage of the German bobsled team celebrating shows the same thing. If you jump for joy, your medal can snap right off and fall to the floor. Olympic organizers are scrambling to figure out the problem, saying, "Obviously, this is something we want to be perfect. But don't feel too bad, Italy. More than a 100 athletes asked for their medals from the 2024 Paris games to be replaced after those started crumbling and flaking with one swimmer comparing the look of his to quote crocodile skin.

**Tracy Mumford**: 这些是头条新闻。我是 Tracy Mumford。明天再见。

**Tracy Mumford**: Those the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow.
