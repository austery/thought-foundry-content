### 人质谈判原则与特朗普策略

**主持人**: 美国总统 **唐纳德·特朗普** 喜欢将自己视为一个交易撮合者，但很多人对他的看法略有不同，更像是一个 **人质** 挟持者。这里的共同点是：利用 **杠杆** 和 **威胁** 来迫使人们给他想要的东西。那么，你该如何应对这样的人呢？答案可能并非来自政治理论或外交剧本，而是来自完全不同的领域：人质谈判。我们采访了一位危机沟通专家，了解他在高风险情况下的经验，以及这能教会我们什么关于在紧张时刻与特朗普打交道。通常的建议很简单：保持冷静。这说起来容易做起来难，尤其是在网上，尤其当你遇到像你猜的那样，来自唐纳德·特朗普这样的人的 **愤怒诱饵** 时。就在过去几天里，他攻击了我们的奥运选手、音乐巨星和加拿大政府。我们探讨了为什么 **愤怒** 在网上如此 **具有传染性**，以及政治家和其他人如何 **利用其力量**。这是《The Rundown》。唐纳德·特朗普毫不犹豫地发出威胁并承诺严厉的后果来达到他想要的目的。那么，在与这样的人打交道时，什么才真正有效呢？我们请一位经验丰富的危机谈判专家来发表看法。J. Paul Nadeau 是一位退休的警探和人质谈判专家，他今天在演播室与我同在。你好，Paul？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: US President Donald Trump likes to think of himself as a deal maker, but a lot of people see him a little differently, more like a hostage taker. The common thread here. Using leverage and threats to force people to give him what he wants. So how do you deal with someone like that? The answer might not come from political theory or diplomatic playbooks, but from somewhere else entirely. Hostage negotiation. We talked to a crisis communicator about his experience in high stakes situations, and what it can teach us about dealing with Trump in tense moments. The advice is usually simple stay calm. That's easier said than done, especially online, and especially when you come across rage bait from people like, you guessed it, Donald Trump. In just the past few days, he's gone after us Olympians, music megastars and the Canadian government. We look at why anger is so contagious online and how politicians and others harness its power. This is The Rundown. Donald Trump doesn't hesitate to issue threats and promise harsh consequences to get what he wants. So what actually works when you're dealing with someone like that? We asked an experienced crisis negotiator to weigh in. J. Paul Nadeau is a retired police detective and hostage negotiator, and he joins me in studio. How are you doing, Paul?

</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 我很好。Jan，你怎么样？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: I'm doing well. Jan, how are you doing?

</details>

**Jan**: 我很好。嗯，我们来谈谈吧。我们知道许多政治家和媒体在描述与唐纳德·特朗普的谈判时，使用了“被劫持”这个词。这只是夸张的说法，还是你会说，这是一个准确的描述？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jan**: I'm doing well. Well, let's let's talk about it. We know that numerous politicians and media have used the term taken hostage in describing their negotiations with Donald Trump. Is that just hyperbole, or is that, would you say, an accurate description?

</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 这将是一个准确的描述。不仅是与特朗普打交道，当今世界的状态，民主的不确定性以及出台的不同政策，都让人们感到非常、非常焦虑，并且觉得被挟持了。当人们想到人质时，他们会想到笼子里的人，他们会想到被武力劫持的人。但实际上，当我们审视世界状况时，我们仍然可能被挟持，即使我们周围没有笼子，因为掌权者可以让我们感到不稳定、担忧、忧虑。所以是的，这是正在发生的事情的一个非常准确的描述。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: That would be an accurate description. Not only is it just dealing with Trump, the state of the world right now with the uncertainties in democracy and in different policies that are coming out, are making people feel very, very anxious and a hostage to me. When people think about hostages, they think about people in cages, they think about people who have been taken by force. But really, when we take a look at the state of the world, we can still be taken hostage, even though there are no cages around us, because the people in control can make us feel unstable, worried, concerned. So yes, that's a very accurate description of what's happening.

</details>

**Jan**: 我们以前见过像唐纳德·特朗普这样的人吗？在世界舞台上？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jan**: Have we seen anyone like Donald Trump before? Sort of on the world stage before?

</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 哦，我们见过。是的。纵观历史，我们见过不同的人。我不会将唐纳德·特朗普与希特勒相提并论，但看看当年德国发生的独裁统治，不同的做法，被剥夺的权利。但纵观历史，我们有过那些真正将自己放在首位的领导人。其结果是，世界上充满了愤怒和不确定性。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: Oh, we have. Yes. Throughout history we have seen different people. I'm not going to compare Donald Trump to Hitler, but take a look at what happened back then in Germany with the dictatorships, the the different approaches, the rights that were taken away. But throughout history, we have had leaders who have really put themselves first. And consequently there's been there's been a lot of of anger and a lot of uncertainty in the world.

</details>

**Jan**: 好的。在你的书《**人质效应**》（The Hostage Effect）中，你提到唐纳德·特朗普的连任是促使你写这本书的催化剂。请帮我理解一下。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jan**: All right. In your book, The Hostage Effect, you speak about the re-election of Donald Trump as being sort of the catalyst for for why you decided to write this book. Help me understand that.

</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 当唐纳德·特朗普当选时，我开始觉得自己也像个人质。比如，接下来会发生什么？他谈论要接管加拿大，接管格陵兰，各种信息和不确定性涌来。我心想，接下来会发生什么？每天都有新的公告，我感到焦虑，我认识的一个人联系我说：“你也有这种感觉吗？”我说：“是的。”她说：“如果你要谈论世界感觉像人质的时候，就是现在了。”我认真想了想，觉得你说得对。我们感觉自己像人质，我们被俘虏了。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: When Donald Trump was elected, I started to feel like a hostage myself. Like, what's going to happen next? He was talking about taking over Canada, taking over Greenland, all kinds of information was coming out and uncertainty. And I felt, well, what's going to happen next? Every day there was a new announcement and I felt anxious, and someone I know quite well reached out to me and says, are you feeling this, too? And I said, yeah. She says, if there was ever a time for you to talk about how the world is feeling like a hostage, it's now. And I thought about that and I thought, you're right. We are feeling like hostages. We're being taken captive.

</details>

**Jan**: 你的书里显然有很多故事，我想进入谈判者的思维模式。你写到的，一个人在某种情况下开始成为人质的早期迹象有哪些？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jan**: There are obviously a number of stories in your book that you talk about, and I want to get sort of into the headspace of a negotiator. What are some of the early signs that a person is becoming a hostage in their situation, that you write about.

</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 当他们觉得自己的声音被压制时，当他们觉得随时可能危及自身安全、自身保障、失去工作时。当一个人感到自己被 immobilised，因为害怕我们的领导人会做什么、说什么或夺走什么而无法前进时。那就是一种人质状态。当我谈论人质效应时，它几乎就像一种病毒，一种条件反射。“你必须听我的，事情就会这样发生。”所以人们就是这种感觉。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: When they feel that their voices are being silenced, when they feel that at any time their safety can be jeopardised, their security can be jeopardised, their jobs can be gone. When a person feels that they are immobilised and unable to move forward from the fear of what our leaders will do or say or take away from us. That is a state of hostage. When I talk about the hostage effect, it's almost like a virus. It's a conditioning. You will listen to me and this is what's going to happen. So that's how people are feeling.

</details>

**Jan**: 准备进入 **危机谈判** 时，什么样的心态是最好的？我们不一定谈论政治家，而是谈论你自己，一位谈判专家。进入情况时，你的心态是怎样的？或者也许你有一个想分享的故事？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jan**: The what sort of mindset is best when preparing to enter a crisis negotiation? We won't talk necessarily as politicians in this case, but as a negotiator yourself. What does that mindset when you're entering into a situation? Or perhaps there is a story that you would like to share.

</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 当我准备谈判时，我会尽我所能去了解我要谈判的对象。我们有什么情报？我从人质谈判专家的角度出发。我们了解这个人吗？情况如何？他面前有什么障碍？我该如何着手？嗯，我首先要做的是，我将首先寻求理解，然后才被理解，因为人们希望被倾听，希望被看见，希望被感受。所以当你与某人在冲突中，甚至在政治局势中进行谈判时，你的方法必须是友好的，必须是开放的，并且必须是一个探究者，问：“我们能一起做些什么来克服这个我们都面临的困难局面？我们双方都想要什么，我们如何解决这个问题？”这就是人质谈判专家的心态。我理解你正在经历很多。嘿，Jeyan，我理解。我来帮忙。如果你有人质，我会这样接近你。我会说：“告诉我发生了什么，这样我才能更好地理解我能在哪里真正帮助你达到你想要达到的目标。”
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: When I'm preparing for a negotiation, I am trying to find out as much as I possibly can about the person I'm about to negotiate with. What intelligence do we have? I'm going from a hostage negotiators standpoint. What do we know about this person? What are the circumstances? What are the barriers in front of it? How am I going to approach? Well, the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to seek first to understand and then to be understood, because people want to be heard, they want to be seen, they want to be felt. So when you're negotiating with someone in a conflict or even in a political situation, your approach has to be amicable, has to be open, and has to be someone who's inquiring, what is it that we can do together to work throughout this difficult situation that we're both, you know, what is it that we both want and how can we resolve this? And that's the mindset of a hostage negotiator. I understand you're going through a lot. Hey, Jeyan, I understand. I'm here to help. That's how I would approach you. If you had a hostage. And I would say, tell me what's going on so that I have a better understanding of where I can actually help you to reach what it is that you're trying to reach.

</details>

**Jan**: 当我们说人质、人质谈判时，我认为我们倾向于想到电影，我们倾向于想到，嗯，谈判专家被叫来了。有一条电话线，对方远在天边。你现在被带进来，你知道，那种帐篷或临时设置。你走进去，拿起电话开始说话。请帮我理解一些故事。如果你有一个至今让你难忘的谈判，那是什么？你能帮助我们理解当时的情况吗？对你正在通话的那个人，以及你当时在做什么？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jan**: When we talk, when we when we say hostage, you know, hostages, hostage negotiations, I think we we tend to think of movies and we tend to think of, you know, the negotiator has been called in. There's a phone line, the person is far away. You are now brought in, you know, the sort of the tent or temporary sort of setup. You come in, you grab the phone and you start talking. Help me understand some of the stories. If there was one negotiation that sticks in your mind to this day. What is can you help us understand what that situation was on both ends for the person that you were talking to, but what you were doing?

</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 哦，当然。你描述的电影场景。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: Oh, absolutely. And what you described in the movies.

</details>

**Jan**: 很多是准确的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jan**: Many accurate.

</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 非常准确。好的。是的。在大多数情况下。这正是它本来的样子。当有人持武器时，我们不希望进行面对面谈判。因为危险性相当大。所以电话交谈，联系到某人。我记得曾与一个情绪失控的男人进行谈判，他劫持了他的分居妻子和四岁的女儿作为人质，他曾威胁要伤害她们，要她们的命，也要了自己的命。我只记得拿起电话，对他说：“嘿，我叫保罗，我是谈判专家。我来帮忙。”然后我们开始对话，我问他：“告诉我你脑子里在想什么？你现在在哪里？发生了什么？”然后我聚焦于他对女儿的爱。这成为了找到他最看重的东西的催化剂。你最看重什么？你想伤害你的女儿吗？有时你必须问那些艰难的问题。通过那次谈话，我让他敞开心扉，意识到什么对他来说才是真正重要的，然后与他一起努力，让他达到一个状态，这需要时间，但他明白，为了大家的最大利益，是时候释放孩子了。是时候释放他的妻子了。但首先我必须让他走到门口，幸运的是。那是一次非常、非常艰难的谈判。它成功了。所有人都活了下来。这就是我们努力的目标。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: Very. Okay. Yeah. For the most part. And that's exactly what it is. We don't want face to face negotiations when there's somebody holding a weapon. Because the danger is quite significant. So the telephone conversation and reaching someone I remember negotiating with a man who was distraught, and he had taken his his estranged wife and his four year old daughter hostage, and he had threatened to harm them before and to take their lives and to take his own. And I just remember getting on the phone with him and establishing that, hey, my name is Paul, I'm the negotiator. I'm here to help. And we then engaged in a conversation where I asked him to tell me what was going on in his mind, like, where are you right now? What's happening? And then focusing on the love he had for his daughter. And and that became a catalyst to find out what mattered to him the most. What matters to you here? And do you want to harm your daughter? Sometimes you have to ask the hard questions. And through that conversation, what I had him do is open up and realise what really was important to him, and then work with him to get him to a state where it took time, but where he understood that in everybody's best interest, it was time to release the child. It was time to release his wife. But first I had to get him to the door, which fortunately. And that was a very, very hard negotiation. It worked. Everybody lived. And that's what we're looking to do.

</details>

**Jan**: 让我们回到特朗普，从他的个性来看，他可能有点反复无常，也许有些人一天到晚都无法预测他的动向，你知道，如果你看他的社交媒体，你会发现一个深夜的帖子就能让世界陷入混乱。但根据我们对唐纳德·特朗普的了解，一位谈判专家在考虑他的性格时，最重要的方面是什么？正如你提到的，当你进入这些谈判时，你会提前了解对方是谁。我们对他了解多少？在你看来，哪些方面是他进入谈判时需要考虑的？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jan**: Let's return back to Trump in the sense of his personality might be a bit erratic, where maybe some people might not be able to to sense from one day to the next where he's going to be, you know, if you're on his, on his socials, it's, you know, a late night text sort of sends the world into a bit of chaos. But knowing what we know about Donald Trump, what are the most important aspects of his character for a negotiator to keep in mind? As you mentioned, when you go into these negotiations, you get a sense of who they are before. What do we know about him, and what are the ones that stick out to you as something, as someone who would go into a negotiation?

</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 他非常专注于获取各种东西，金钱是其中之一。他说他代表美国的最大利益，他提出了一些相当严厉的主张。他在许多方面都做得很好，但在其他方面，他似乎真的在dictating事情的发展方式。谈判者必须以开放的心态来处理，并建立融洽的关系，因为当一个人认识你、喜欢你并信任你时，他们更愿意与你合作。我们不一定总要同意我们正在讨论或谈判的对象，但我们 অবশ্যই 必须让他们说话，让他们感觉被倾听，感觉被理解。否则，就没有成功的可能。再次强调，这归结为信任、好感。这些是关键，能让你说：“好吧，我们如何一起努力让这件事奏效？”
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: He's very focussed on acquiring a number of different things, and and money is one of them. He he says that he has the best interests of the United States in hand, and he's making some, some pretty harsh claims. He's doing some good in many areas, but in other areas it feels like he is really dictating the way things are going to happen. A negotiator has to approach that with an open mind and establish a rapport, because when somebody knows you, likes you and trusts you, they're more willing to work with you. We don't always have to agree with the person that we're discussing or negotiating with, but we certainly have to let them speak and to have them feel like they're being heard and feel like they're being understood. Unless we do that, there is no way of succeeding. And again, it comes down to trust, likeability. And those are the important keys that will get you to say, well, how is it that we can work together to make this work?

</details>

**Jan**: 你想澄清一下，唐纳德·特朗普目前并不是字面意义上地劫持人质，对吧？我们当然是在谈论理论上的情况。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jan**: Do you want to clarify that Donald Trump is not literally taking hostages at the moment? We're talking theoretical ones, of course.

</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 不，绝对，绝对。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: No, absolutely, absolutely.

</details>

**Jan**: 我确实想了解一下你所受训和使用过的人质谈判原则。它们是否，比如，哪些原则真正适用于像唐纳德·特朗普这样的人？然后类比在哪里会失效，也就是说，你将不得不应用一些稍微不同的东西？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jan**: I do want to understand sort of the hostage negotiation principles that you have trained on that you've used. Do they like which ones genuinely transfer to someone like Donald Trump? And then where do the analogies break down, where, you know, this is someone where you're going to have to apply something a little different.

</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 人质谈判的方法在所有情况下都适用。我在商业领域和各处教授这一点。总有一种方法可以接近一个人，让他觉得自己被倾听。就像我之前说的。它会考虑到他们正在经历什么，因为每个人都在经历不同的事情。但除非我们有探究的精神并向人们询问这些问题，否则我们永远不会知道。所以方法是开放的，是愿意合作的。如果有冲突，愿意解决冲突。当人们停止沟通或举手说：“听着，我受够了，你不能理解我。”这时谈判就破裂了。这就像人质谈判。如果我有一个劫持了四名人质的劫持者，如果我不能好好相处，不愿意敞开心扉并花时间，这需要时间。但如果我到了那个地步，我说：“听着，约翰，好吧，我们就是合不来，你留两个，给我两个，我们就算了。”你不能那样做，对吧？你必须长期坚持，并尽可能有意义地工作，以保持谈判的进行。有时会很艰难。你必须回去，重新调整，重新思考，重新接近。我看不出这种情况会发生。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: The hostage negotiator approaches work in every circumstance. And I teach this in business. And everywhere there is, there is a way of approaching an individual that makes them feel heard. As I said earlier too. And it takes into consideration what they're going through because everybody is going through something different. But unless we have an inquiring mind and ask these, these things of people, we'll never know. So the approach is one of openness, one of willingness to to work. And if there is a conflict willing to work through that conflict, where it falls apart is where people stop communicating or put their hands up and say, listen, I've had enough of this, and you don't see things my way. It's like hostage negotiator. If I if if I had a hostage taker who had four hostages, if I wasn't getting along, wasn't willing to open up and take the time, it takes time. But if I was at that point where I said, listen, John, okay, we're just not getting along, how about you keep two hostages and you give me two hostages? We'll call it a day. You can't do that, right? You have to stay in for the long run and work as as meaningful as you possibly can to keep that negotiation going. Sometimes it's going to be rough. You have to go back and and regroup, rethink re-approach. I don't see that happening.

</details>

**Jan**: 我想，这可能与你提到的你的一些例子中的谈判有所不同，那些谈判是私下通过电话进行的，没有太多噪音。我们看到唐纳德·特朗普的情况是，正如我们提到的，社交媒体，我们看到新闻发布会。当你谈到“伏击”这个词时，我认为很多人会想到，你知道，泽连斯基在白宫会见唐纳德·特朗普，你知道，两位领导人面对面。那同样，也不是任何形式的谈判。但是，当谈判对象正在为观众、他们的支持者在媒体上表演时，谈判是如何改变的？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jan**: I want to what's a little bit different from perhaps some of the negotiations, as you mentioned, with one of your examples, these are done privately on a phone call. There's not a lot of noise. What we're seeing with Donald Trump is, as we mentioned, social media, we're seeing press conferences. When you talk about the word ambush, I think a lot of people think of, you know, Zelensky meeting Donald Trump in the white House and, you know, two leaders across from each other. And that was, again, not a negotiation of any sort. But what how does the negotiation change when the subject is performing for an audience, their supporters on media, for example?

</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 它改变了，因为我认为这是关于不被理解的问题，或者把自己抛出去说：“看，就是我，看我有多强硬。”在某些情况下，当一个人为了媒体而拍着胸脯说：“要么我的方式，要么滚蛋”，有时你就无法与处于那种思维状态的人进行谈判，至少在那时不行。然后，在幕后，必须有其他的方式和手段来尝试接触并重新谈判，并保持那种开放性和意愿。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: It changes because I believe it's a matter of not being understood or throwing yourself out there and saying, look, it's me, look how tough I am. And that's going to happen in certain situations where an individual for the media will strike their chest and say, it's my way or the highway, and sometimes you just can't negotiate with someone who is in that state of mind, not at that time. And then in the background, there has to be other ways and means of trying to reach out and renegotiate and have that openness and that willingness.

</details>

**Jan**: 有些人可能会说，这是唐纳德·特朗普在这些情况下试图获得 **杠杆**。你怎么看？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jan**: Some might say that this is Donald Trump trying to get leverage in some of these situations. What do you say to that?

</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 我说那是真的。是的，我说在他看来，那确实是真的。我无法回溯并确切告诉你这一切的起源，但是的，他确实想要杠杆。我们在许多情况下都看到了这一点，某些东西被剥夺了，几乎是从人们那里被剥夺了。这就是为什么他们感觉自己像人质。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: I say that's true. Yeah, I say that that that's very true in his mind. And I can't go back and tell you exactly where this all originated from. But yes, he does want leverage. And we're seeing that in many instances where certain things are being taken, almost taken away from people. That's why they're feeling like hostages.

</details>

**Jan**: 很多人想知道，为什么还要费心去打电话，甚至保持那条线畅通呢？为什么不干脆挂断呢？为什么，为什么还要费心与特朗普谈判？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jan**: There are many folks who wonder why even bother picking up the phone or even keeping that line active. Why not just hang it up? Why? Why even bother negotiating with Trump?

</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 想象一下不这样做。想象一下不站出来，不采取你可能采取的任何行动。正当的行动。想象一下就放弃，说：“好吧，你全拿去了。”当人们不以和平的方式表达他们的反对意见时，一切都会被剥夺。我们的权利，我们的声音，我们的特权。这就是为什么继续与像特朗普这样的人谈判，或者继续对你认为是 injustices 的事情进行 **和平抵抗** 至关重要，因为不这样做会让你成为我们所说的那种人质。你觉得自己现在是人质，那就放弃与特朗普谈判吧。放弃谈论你认为在你国家内部存在的不公。那么 **1984** 就近在眼前了。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: Imagine not. Imagine not standing up and and taking whatever action you possibly can. Rightful action. Imagine just giving up and saying, okay, you got it all. When people don't express their opposition and do it in a peaceful way, then everything will be taken away. Our rights, our voices, our privileges. This is why it's so important to continue to negotiate with someone like Trump, or to continue to do peaceful resistance as to what you see as an injustice, because not doing it makes you that hostage we're talking about. You think you're a hostage now give up on on negotiating with Trump. Give up on speaking about what you feel are injustices within your country. And 1984 is right around the corner.

</details>

**Jan**: 让我们谈谈我们国家的主要谈判代表，**马克·卡尼**。我来举个电影的例子。如果你发现自己和卡尼在一部电梯里，也许你有 30 秒的时间，在他离开之前。当你进入与唐纳德·特朗普的又一轮谈判时，你会给他什么建议？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jan**: Let's talk about our lead negotiator here in this country, Mark Carney. I'm going to play to the movies here. If you found yourself in an elevator with Carney, maybe you've got 30 seconds before he goes. What advice would you give him as he enters another round of negotiations with Donald Trump?

</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 学会谈判。学会如何说话，如何倾听，并表现出真诚的兴趣。我会说：你必须采取立场，并且必须以一定的权威来做，但你也必须愿意倾听。而且，我再次回到 **斯蒂芬·柯维** 多年来所说的，在他的书和演讲中：“**首先寻求理解，然后才被理解**”。知道你想要从交易中得到什么，但也要问对方。愿意参与并建立信任，而不是采取攻势。但我还没见过这样的谈判。这就是问题所在。我还没见过。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: Learn how to negotiate. Learn how to learn how to to speak, to listen and to show genuine interest. I would say. You have to take a stance and you have to do it with a certain amount of authority, but you also have to be willing to listen. And again, I go back to what Stephen Covey has said for many, many years. And in his books and his speaks, his talks seek first to understand, then to be understood. Know what you want out of the deal, but also ask the other individual. Be willing to engage and build that trust, not take an offensive. But I haven't seen a negotiation. That's the problem. I haven't seen that.

</details>

**Jan**: 好的，Paul，我们今天就到这里。我非常感谢你的时间。感谢你在这件事上的见解。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jan**: Okay, Paul, we are going to have to leave it there. I really appreciate your time. Thank you for your insights on this one.

### 网络愤怒的传播与‘愤怒诱饵’

**主持人**: 这些天，网上的 **愤怒** 和 **攻击性** 似乎比以往任何时候都更响亮、更尖锐、更难以逃避。然后，还有那些似乎专门为了触发强烈反应的人。那么，什么是 **愤怒诱饵**（rage bait）？为什么它如此有效？**克莱尔·韦斯纳**（Claire Weisner）是英属哥伦比亚大学奥肯那根分校的毕业生，她作为硕士论文的一部分，对愤怒诱饵进行了研究。她现在从埃德蒙顿与我们连线。你好吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: These days, anger and aggressiveness online seem to feel louder, sharper and harder to escape than ever. And then there are those who seem set on triggering those strong reactions. So what is rage bait and why is it so effective? Claire Weisner is a graduate of the University of British Columbia Okanagan, who led a study on rage bait as part of her master's thesis. And she joins us from Edmonton. How are you doing?

**Claire Weisner**: 是的。所以，实际上在 2020 年，当 **埃隆·马斯克** 接管了以前的 Twitter，现在的 X 时，很多人在网上给了他很大的压力。他很多时候都用一个笑哭的表情符号来回应。以至于人们开始指出这一点。我读了一篇博客文章，指出他使用了多少这个表情符号，与其他表情符号相比。如果你搜索“埃隆·马斯克 笑哭表情符号”，你会得到大量的关于他如何用这个表情符号回应某种争议的新闻文章。我很好奇，因为那不是我第一反应会想到的愤怒的反应。那是笑哭的表情符号，不是“生气”，对吧？所以我很好奇，在这个新的在线空间，在线空间和数字景观中，我们是如何表达和解读愤怒的？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire Weisner**: Yeah. So actually in 2020, when Elon Musk took over what's formerly Twitter now X, a lot of people were giving him a really hard time online. And he responded a lot of the time with a laughing, crying emoji. So much so that people started pointing it out. I read an article like a blog article pointing out how much he's been using it in comparison to other emojis. If you look up Elon Musk laughing crying emoji, you'll get like tons and tons of news articles about how he's responded to some sort of controversy with this emoji. And I was just really curious, because that's not what I would immediately think of as an angry response. That's a laughing, crying emoji. Not like GR, right? So I was really curious, how are we expressing, how are we interpreting anger in this new space of online like online spaces in digital landscapes?

</details>

**Jan**: 我甚至都不知道。我正在想我最后一次发帖或评论是什么，它正好是一个笑脸，然后是一个滚动的笑脸。所以现在我也需要重新思考了。请帮我们理解一下，嗯，我们中的许多人，包括我作为一名记者，我们都有过在网上发布我们认为无害或信息性的内容，突然发现，比如说，意想不到的愤怒反应的经历。请帮我们理解。人们在网上比在现实生活中更容易生气或反应更激烈吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jan**: I didn't even know that. And I'm trying to think of the last kind of post that I or comment that I had, and it was exactly a laugh and then a rolling smile. So now I need to rethink that as well. Help us understand, you know, many of us and as a journalist as well, many of us have experienced posting something we think is innocent online or something that's informative and suddenly finding, let's say, unexpected angry reactions help us understand. Do people tend to act or react more angrily online than they would perhaps in real life?

</details>

**Claire Weisner**: 是的。所以愤怒是一种高唤醒情绪，这意味着它是我们更倾向于采取行动的情绪之一。所以，即使你的帖子有 100 人看到，25 人觉得“酷，太棒了”，25 人觉得“哦，这让我难过”，然后 50 人觉得“哦，我生气了”。这 50 人比另外 50 人更有可能评论、互动、分享或谈论它。仅仅因为它是一种高唤醒情绪，意味着他们想要采取行动。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire Weisner**: So yeah. So anger is a high arousal emotion, which means that it's one of the emotions that we're more incentivised to act upon. So even if you have 100 eyes on your post, 25 people are like, cool, that's that's great. 25 people are like, oh, that bums me out. And then 50 people are like, oh, I'm. Those 50 people are more likely than those other 50 people to comment or engage or share or talk about it. Just because it's that high arousal emotion means that they want to act.

</details>

**Jan**: 现在，请帮我们理解一下 **数字环境** 本身。环境中的哪些因素会导致这些愤怒的反应？我猜当我们谈论愤怒的评论、愤怒的反应时，我首先想到的是全大写的那种尖叫和喊叫，但我们知道，即使在短信中，像在句子末尾加一个句号这样微妙的事情也可能引起误解。这可能只是一个代际问题。对一些人来说，可能是表情符号。但数字环境中存在哪些因素会导致这种情况发酵？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jan**: Now, help us understand the the digital environment itself. What factors in the environment contribute to these angry reactions? I'm assuming when we talk about angry comments, angry reactions, I'm thinking right off the bat all caps kind of screaming and yelling, but we know it's as subtle as something, even in text messages, as putting a period at the end of a sentence. That might just be a generational thing. For some people, it could be the emojis. But what are the factors in the digital environment that allow for this to to kind of fester?

</details>

**Claire Weisner**: 是的。所以主要的事情之一其实是它所在的平台。你已经提到了。在人际沟通中，在那种短信环境中，它更可能是我们所说的“冷愤怒”，在那里你更注重控制你的形象，表现得非常冷静、镇定。然后像 TikTok 更有可能是支持性的。那是我唯一找到的地方之一。当我期待愤怒的评论时，我发现很多人在改变叙事，积极地选择支持。然后有传闻说 Instagram 更容易引发愤怒。你更有可能根据 Reddit 的格式写出长篇博客。所以这再次取决于你所在的平台的实际环境，以及该平台的 **社会规范**。所以在 Instagram 上，互相欺凌有点更常见，而在 TikTok 上，采取主动并积极选择支持则更常见。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire Weisner**: Yeah. So one of the main things is actually the platform that it's on. So you already touched on that. So in interpersonal communication, in that texting environment it's more likely to be what we call cold anger, where you're a little bit more invested in controlling your image, coming across as very calm collected and then also like TikTok is more likely to be supportive. That's one of the only places that I actually found. When I expected angry comments, I found a lot of people changing the narrative, actively deciding to be supportive. And then there's anecdotal evidence that says that Instagram is more likely to be angry. You're more likely to get long blog posts based off of the format in Reddit. So it just again, it depends on the environment of the actual platform that you're on, and then also the social norms of that platform. So on Instagram, it's a little bit more common to bully each other, whereas TikTok it's a little bit more common to take that step and actively be choosing to be supportive.

</details>

**Jan**: 你能举一个例子吗？一个故事，在你说到的那些平台之间会被不同地看待？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jan**: Can you give us an example of a story that would be kind of viewed differently amongst some of those platforms that you, you had named?

</details>

**Claire Weisner**: 是的。我实际上对关于 **加拿大住房危机** 的帖子进行了研究。所以，其中一件事是，帖子本身在 Reddit 上很可能就是一种不同的形式。它通常是一个文章链接或文章的摘要。在 TikTok 上，它可能是，例如，那个有支持性的帖子，只是一个街头采访，他们问：“你拥有房子吗？”然后一位年轻女士说：“是的，我拥有房子。”但也有人只是在谈论他们的观点之类的。所以稍微更……不像 Reddit 那么正式，在 Reddit 上他们会说：“好吧，就像，这是事实。就像，这是我们要讨论的新闻文章，你知道，尽量保持真实。”而在 TikTok 上，则更随意一些，“我们只是在谈论我们的观点，我们的感受。”
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire Weisner**: Yeah. So I actually did my research on specifically posts that were about the Canadian housing crisis. So one of the things is that just the post itself was going to probably be a different format on Reddit. It was often a link to an article or a synopsis of an article on TikTok. It could be, for example, the one with the support that was just an interview on the street, and they were like, oh, do you own a house? And this young woman said, yes, I own a house. But then there's also people just talking about their opinions and stuff like that. So a little bit more. Not as formal as Reddit, where they're like, okay, like these are the facts. Like these are the news articles that we're going to be talking about, you know, try and keep it grounded, whereas TikTok is a little bit more, you know, loosey goosey. We're just talking about our opinions, how we feel.

</details>

**Jan**: 好的。除了人们如何回复帖子之外，一些媒体似乎是故意这样做的。有些账户就是所谓的 **愤怒诱饵**（rage baiting），据我所知，这是牛津词典 2025 年的年度词汇。为什么不是快乐诱饵或悲伤诱饵呢？愤怒诱饵是怎么回事？我不知道我是否刚创造了一个词，但是的，愤怒诱饵是怎么回事？为什么是关于愤怒的？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jan**: All right. Aside from how people reply to posts, some outlets appear to do this intentionally. Some accounts where what is known as rage baiting, which was, from what I understand, Oxford Dictionaries 2025 word of the year. Why not joy baiting or sad? What is it about rage baiting? I don't know if I just coined a term there, but yeah, what is it about rage baiting? Why is it about anger?

</details>

**Claire Weisner**: 是的，我喜欢快乐诱饵。是的。所以，再次回到高唤醒情绪，这只会带来更多金钱。所以我们更有可能获得点击、分享、评论，人们真正谈论它。文献表明，特别是与快乐相比，我们更倾向于以积极的方式参与愤怒，而不是快乐。所以最终，这是底线。什么能为我们带来最多的钱？尤其是在网红时代，你赚多少钱完全取决于你在帖子上的参与度有多高。激怒人们并让他们在那个层面上与你互动，这是非常有效的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire Weisner**: Yeah, I would love joy baiting. Yeah. So again, going back to that high arousal emotion, it's just going to make more money. So we're more likely to get those clicks, those shares, those comments, people actually talking about it. We there. The literature suggests that especially compared to Joy specifically, we're much more likely to engage in that active way with anger than we are with joy. So it's just at the end of the day, it's the bottom line. What's making us the most money, especially like in an era of like influencers, where what the money that you make depends quite literally on how much engagement you're getting on your post. It can be very effective to upset people and get them to engage with you on that level.

</details>

**Jan**: 你能举个例子吗？我想到了快乐诱饵。我想到了猫，我爱猫，我家里有猫，我想到了这些可爱的视频，然后是愤怒诱饵。什么？给我一些人们可能经常看到的愤怒诱饵的例子？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jan**: Can you give an example? I'm thinking of joy baiting. I'm thinking of cats, I love cats, I have a cat at home thinking of these cute videos and then rage baiting. What? Give me some examples of what people might be used to seeing when it's when when we consider something as rage baiting.

</details>

**Claire Weisner**: 是的，我遇到的很多愤怒诱饵都与 **移民** 有关，因为，再次强调，加拿大住房危机。所以只是笼统的说法，不一定基于现实，关于移民和政治，只是非常、非常笼统的说法，可以激怒任何人。不一定取决于你的政治立场，因为它是，你知道，不一定基于事实，但它是一个非常、非常情绪化的话题，而且常常有点冒犯性。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire Weisner**: Yeah, a lot of the rage bait that I encountered was about immigration, because, again, that Canadian housing crisis. And so just broad statements that aren't necessarily grounded in reality about immigration and politics, just really, really broad statements that can kind of make anyone angry. It doesn't necessarily matter where you land on the political spectrum just because it's, you know, not necessarily grounded in fact, but it is a very, very emotional subject and it often is a little bit offensive.

</details>

**Jan**: 好了，让我们以移民为例。你知道，正如你所说，它在网上发展起来了。但我们也看到了抗议活动，你知道，在这场对话的双方都有，在全国各地。我们在网上越来越多地暴露在激烈的愤怒中吗？这对我们的现实世界有什么影响？我认为我们中的许多人认为它在 .com 上是受到保护的。但有，我们看到 **溢出效应** 吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jan**: Well, let's talk about let's use immigration as an example. You know, something that, as you said, kind of grew online. But we did see protests, you know, on both sides of the coin on that conversation across the country, are we increasingly exposed to hot anger online? And what impact does that have? Sort of in our real world? I think a lot of us think that it is kind of protected, sort of on the, on the.com. But there is are we seeing spill-over?

</details>

**Claire Weisner**: 是的。所以我们，就像你说的，我们感觉有点受保护。这被称为 **社会隔离** 的想法，即我们看不到屏幕上的另一个人。所以他们就不再是真实的人了。后果是我们不会考虑他们。所以，虽然在人际交往中，我可能不太可能对一个不同意我的人大喊大叫，但在网上我更有可能这样做，因为他们如何看待我，我的社会地位，不会因为这次互动而受到威胁。我认为我们确实看到了一些溢出效应，但仍然存在那些社会习俗，阻止我们在人际交往中表现不佳，而在网络空间中则不然。所以很多人会说，就像在这些网络空间里，我以为这是很正常的。然后我走出来，和真人交谈，你知道，这比我最初想的要复杂得多。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire Weisner**: Yeah. So we like you said, we're a little bit we feel a little bit protected. It's called like a social isolation idea where we can't see the other person on the screen. So they kind of stop being real. And the consequences are we don't think of them. So whereas in person, I might be less likely to scream and yell at someone who disagrees with me. I'm more likely to do that online just because the consequences of how they perceive me, of my, you know, social standing is aren't in peril from this engagement. I do think that we are a little bit seeing spill-over, but there is still those social mores that inhibit us from behaving poorly in person in a way that we don't see in online spaces. So a lot of people will like, talk about like in these online spaces. I, I thought that this was really normal. And then I came out of it and it like and I talked to real people and you know, it's a lot more nuanced than maybe I'd initially thought.

</details>

**Jan**: 这么说来，我们社会变得越来越愤怒了吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jan**: With that being said, are we becoming an angrier society?

</details>

**Claire Weisner**: 我不能肯定地说，这有点超出了我的研究范围，但我们肯定在网络空间中变得越来越习惯于互相攻击。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire Weisner**: I couldn't say that's definitely a little bit out of the scope of my research, but definitely we are becoming more comfortable with being aggressive with each other in online spaces specifically.

</details>

**Jan**: 好的。我的最后一个问题是，你知道，对于很多人来说，他们可能正在用手机看这个节目，他们每天都感受到网络愤怒的重压。我们能做些什么？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jan**: All right. My last question to you is, you know, for someone for a lot of people who are on their phones probably watching this segment on their phones as well, what advice would you give to ordinary folks who are feeling the weight of online anger on a daily basis? What can we do?

</details>

**Claire Weisner**: 是的，绝对。第一，退一步。试着记住，屏幕另一端的人也是人。这是我总是要提醒自己的事，他们不一定有意伤害我。他们只是没有把我当人来看。他们把我当作一个互联网上的空白画布。另外，请记住，谁在从你的愤怒中获利？所以如果你看到某件事让你非常非常生气，谁从中赚钱？如果你能识别出来，那么也许它就不值得你去互动。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Claire Weisner**: Yeah, definitely. Number one, step back. Try and remember that the person on the other end is also a person. That's something that I always have to remind myself that they're not necessarily doing this with the intention of hurting me. They just aren't thinking about me as a person. They're thinking about me as this, you know, empty canvas of internet. And also just remember who's profiting off of what you are, what makes you angry. So if you see something and it really, really upsets you, who makes money off of that? And if it's if you can identify that, then maybe it's not worth engaging with.

</details>

**Jan**: 好的，Claire，我非常感谢你的见解。非常感谢你。是的，也许我们会看。我的手机一直在听，所以我希望在这个节目之后能收到很多猫咪视频。非常感谢。非常感谢你。祝你一天愉快。
