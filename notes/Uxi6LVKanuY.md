title: OpenAI的“红色警报”：AI巨头激战、Sacks反击《纽约时报》及美国贫困线新争议

### OpenAI拉响“红色警报”：AI市场进入白热化竞争

Jason Calacanis：好的，各位，欢迎回到世界第一播客 All-In Podcast。我们直接进入正题。Sam Altman 已经拉响了“红色警报”。他在周一发了一份备忘录，告诉员工们停止在广告等“支线任务”上耗费精力，转而专注于核心的 ChatGPT 体验，让它变得更快、更好。我想我们都知道原因，因为 Google 的 Gemini、马斯克的 Grok 和 Anthropic 的 Claude 最近表现都非常出色。ChatGPT-5，我们就这么叫它吧，可以说有点失败，没有达到预期。

<details>

<p class="english-text">All right, everybody. Welcome back to the number one podcast in the world, the AllIn podcast. First up on the docket. A code red has been called by Sam Altman. He sent a memo on Monday. He told employees to stop working on side quests, you know, like ads, etc., and focus on the core chat GPT, the core experience. Make it faster, make it better. And I think we all know why because Gemini and Grock and Claude from Anthropic have been crushing it. Chat GPT5, let's call it what it is, was a bit of a flop. It didn't perform to expectations.</p>
</details>

Jason Calacanis：从今年夏天开始，Anthropic 在企业收入方面已经开始超越 OpenAI。我之前也提过，我看到越来越多的创业公司倾向于使用 Anthropic 和 Google Gemini 的 API，他们本质上不相信 OpenAI 不会窃取他们的业务。所以，现在正发生着巨大的变化。数据显示，Anthropic 的大部分收入来自企业客户，而 OpenAI 的大部分收入则来自消费者。竞争非常激烈。Chamath，你对场上的局势有什么看法？对于不了解的人来说，我们行业的**红色警报**（Code Red: 科技行业术语，指公司召集所有员工，暂停次要项目，集中精力解决一个生死攸关的核心问题）就是指所有人都回到办公室，专注于一件事。显然，Sam 正在这么做。你如何解读？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Anthropic is beating OpenAI in enterprise revenue starting this summer. And I talked about how, you know, previous episodes on the streets. I'm seeing more startups want to use Anthropic API and also Google Gemini's API and and they don't essentially trust Open AI to not steal their business. So, it's big changes right now. Most of Anthropics revenue here is corporate. Most of OpenAI's as everybody knows is consumer. A lot of deals being made, but competition is fierce. Chimath, your thoughts here on the game on the field. Code red for people who don't know in our industry is when everybody reports to the office and gets focused on one thing. And uh that's apparently what Sam's doing. How do you interpret it?</p>
</details>

Chamath Palihapitiya：我认为可以从战略和战术两个层面来看。从战略层面看，这是一个极具活力和动态的市场，现在就断定赢家还为时过早，也太困难了，除了在芯片层面，那里的格局已基本确定。在模型市场，这让我想起了我们当年创建 Facebook 的时候。我记得我们六个高管围坐在一起，看着比我们大一个数量级的 MySpace。但在某个时刻，我们意识到，我们的产品在根本上就比他们的好。他们有一亿多用户，而我们只有大约一千五百万。但我们知道我们最终会击败他们。我觉得这个市场也在类似地演变，虽然有早期的赢家，但仍有太多工作要做，太多消费者的期望需要去定义，所以现在说谁会赢还太早。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look, I think that there are two things. Let's do the strategic lens and then the tactical lens. the strategic lens is that this is an incredibly vibrant and dynamic market and I think it's too difficult and too early to pick winners other than at the silicon layer where largely that die has been cast. But above it at the model market. It reminds me, frankly, a lot of when we were building Facebook. I remember sitting around our senior executive team, six of us, looking at MySpace, who was an order of magnitude bigger than us. And at some point, we were like, you know what, our product is just fundamentally better than theirs. And they had 100 million plus users and we had sort of 15. But we knew that we were eventually going to beat them. Nobody else knew. And I feel like this market is similarly evolving, which is that you have these early winners, but there's still so much work to do. There's still so many consumer expectations to define that it's too early to know who's going to win.</p>
</details>

Chamath Palihapitiya：我们最终学到的是，分发渠道仍然至关重要，这对 Google 有利，对 Meta 也有利，尽管 Meta 相当落后。现在，它仍然对 OpenAI 有利，因为他们有8亿月活跃用户。那么从战术上讲，在这样一个竞争激烈的格局中，你该怎么做？我认为你必须精简焦点，并试图将每个机会都变成一场危机。因为公司往往会自然增长，熵增效应导致各级都在招聘。我认为，如果 Sam 能利用不同时间点来收紧核心焦点，他们会做得更好。这正是 Google 不久前所做的。他们利用“黑人乔治·华盛顿”事件作为集结号，精简组织，集中精力，让最优秀、最聪明的人去从事杠杆效应最高的任务。现在你看到的是他们超乎寻常的表现。Gemini 令人难以置信。所以，我认为现在发生的就是这样。现在下结论为时过早，这是一场三到四匹马的比赛，Sam 需要做好准备。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And ultimately, what we are learning, especially as all these markets converge, is that distribution still matters a ton, which favors Google. It favors Meta, although Meta's quite behind. And now it will still favor OpenAI because they have 800 million monthly activives. So then the tactical thing is what do you do knowing that this dynamic is set up to have a lot of competition and I think what you have to do is streamline the focus and try to make a crisis out of every opportunity. I think if Sam can use different points in time to tighten the core focus, they'll be better off. And I think that is what Google did a while back. If you remember the whole black George Washington thing, they were able to use that as a rallying cry to streamline the organization and to focus and to get their best and smartest people to work on the most highly leveraged tasks. And what you see now is an incredible overperformance from where they were. I've said this before, but Gemini is is incredible. So, I think that that's what's happening. Too early to call. It's a three or four horse race and Sam needs to batten down the hatches.</p>
</details>

Jason Calacanis：是的，正如我们所见，Sergey Brin 亲自发起了“红色警报”，他说：“我必须到办公室去，我必须激励每一个人，因为如果我们失去了搜索业务，这对我们来说是生死存亡的问题。” 结果“红色警报”奏效了。David Friedberg，也许你可以谈谈“红色警报”作为一种管理技巧。你曾在 Google 工作，我不知道那时他们是否会启动“红色警报”，因为当时你们几乎没有竞争对手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And as we saw, Sergey called a personal code red. He said, "I have to get in the office. I have to inspire everybody because this is existential for us if we lose the search franchise, which they haven't. The code red works." So David Freeberg, maybe you could discuss a little bit code red as a management technique. You were at Google. I don't know if they were calling code reds back then because you didn't have any competition, but we're in a much different world here.</p>
</details>

David Friedberg：我认为 Google 在搜索领域曾一度领先，然后微软推出了自己的产品，这在 Google 内部形成了一种“红色警报”模式，代号为“加拿大项目”（Project Canada），用来指代微软。当时每周都有战情室会议，很多战略和产品决策都是围绕着来自微软的迫在眉睫的威胁制定的。这是一种非常强大的方法。美国就是在与俄罗斯的竞赛中登上了月球。我们现在也是在与中国的技术和人工智能霸权竞赛中。有一个迫在眉睫的威胁是一种非常强大的激励策略，它能让人集中精力，推动创新。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think Google had an early lead in search and then Microsoft launched and it formed a code red model at Google that was called Project Canada as the code word for Microsoft. And there was a weekly war room meeting and a whole bunch of strategy and product decision-making that was driven around the impending threat from Microsoft. It is a very powerful method. It is how the United States got to the moon in a race with Russia. It is how we are now in a race for supremacy in technology and AI against China. Having an impending threat is a very strong motivational tactic. It is a very focusing setting and it drives innovation.</p>
</details>

David Friedberg：ChatGPT 基本上是 AI 或 LLM 聊天界面市场的垄断者，所以它的市场份额只有一条路可走，那就是下降。Google 目前大约占有 14% 的市场份额。你可以看到 OpenAI 正在走下坡路。一年多以前，他们在生成式 AI 流量中拥有超过 90% 的市场份额，而今天 Gemini 已经达到了 14-15%。Google 建立的深度和飞轮效应给了他们巨大的优势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Chat GPT was basically the market monopoly in AI or LLM chat interface and it only had one way to go which was down. Google I think at this point has roughly 14%. So here you can see OpenAI is on the decline. Obviously a little over a year ago they were at 90% plus market share in generative AI traffic and today Gemini is at 14 15%. the depth, the flywheel that Google has built gives them such extraordinary advantage.</p>
</details>

Jason Calacanis：好的，我们来问问“帕尔帕廷皇帝”。David Sacks，这一切正如你所策划的那样发展。你希望看到充满活力的竞争，现在我们看到了。请从华盛顿的视角评估一下当前的竞争格局。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, let's go to Emperor Palpatine. Uh, this is coming together as exactly as you orchestrated you as thesar of AI and crypto. Thank you for your service, civil servant David Sachs. You wanted to see vibrant competition. Well, here we have it. Assess the playing field as you see it from DC.</p>
</details>

David Sacks：首先，我要赞扬 Sam 启动这次“红色警报”。CEO 们通常很容易说些场面话，忽视问题，尤其是在讨论问题会引发他们不喜欢的公关风波时。我认为硅谷的独特之处在于，创始人和 CEO 们确实以一种更关乎存亡的方式来对待公司的处境，因为我们确实面临着巨大的竞争。因此，每当有 CEO 愿意为了让团队专注于真正的业务问题而接受负面公关报道时，我认为他们都值得称赞。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, first of all, let me give credit to Sam for calling this code red, breaking the glass, and pulling the the alarm. I think it's so easy for CEOs in general to engage in happy talk and ignore problems, especially when discussing them is going to create a PR story that they don't like. And I do think one of the things that's unique about Silicon Valley is just that the founders and CEOs do treat the situation of their companies in a more existential way because we actually do have tremendous competition. And so anytime I think a CEO is willing to again take a bad PR story in order to focus their troops on a real business problem, I think they deserve credit for it.</p>
</details>

David Sacks：就整个生态系统而言，竞争非常激烈。我认为我们有五家主要公司，它们各有优势。ChatGPT 是消费者市场的领导者。但 Google 推出了新的 Gemini 3，并开始凭借其强大的性能以及与 Google 搜索的整合来抢占市场份额。然后是 Anthropic，他们的产品非常好，似乎拥有最好的编码助手，并在企业市场开辟了一个非常有利可图的细分市场。接着是 xAI，由于与 X 的整合，我认为它在时事方面做得最好。还有 Meta，虽然遇到了一些阻力，但他们将继续在 AI 领域进行巨额投资。你看到的是这些公司在互相超越，不断有新版本发布，在排行榜上交替领先。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now with respect to the a whole, it is very competitive and I think we've got five major companies and they all have their strengths. So chat GPT is the leader in consumer. But then Google came out with their new Gemini 3 and they were starting to take share. Then you've got anthropic like you mentioned where their products are very good. Everybody seems to say that they have the best coding assistant and they're carving out a very lucrative niche in enterprise. And then you've got XAI which I think is the best at current events because of the integration with X. And also Elon seems to be able to scale his data center, his training cluster the fastest. I guess Meta has sort of hit some headwinds, but they're going to continue investing tremendously in AI and they've got deep pockets to do it. So, you know what you see is all these companies are kind of leapronging each other. you get a new version and then they sort of leaprog each other in terms of the leaderboards.</p>
</details>

David Sacks：我把这描述为一种“金发姑娘”情景（Goldilocks scenario），即 AI 领域在取得巨大进步的同时，市场保持着非常激烈的竞争。理想情况下，它不会像我们在其他科技市场看到的那样，最终整合成一个垄断者。至于美中对比，竞争能激发出美国体系最好的一面。我认为这正是创造最大进步的原因，也是我们能赢得与中国 AI 竞赛的原因。中国也有很多竞争，但他们更倾向于指定“国家冠军”。毫无疑问，在美国体系中，是竞争带来了最好的结果，我们现在看到的就是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I've described this as sort of a a goldilock scenario where you're making a lot of progress in AI but the market is remaining very competitive ideally it does not consolidate just to on monopoly player like we've seen in other tech markets. Versus China. What does it say versus us versus China? Well, look, competition brings out the best in the American system. And I think that that is what creates the most progress and that's what's going to allow us to win the AI race against China. China has a lot of competition too, but they do tend to anoint national champions more. There's no question that in the American system, it's competition that brings out the best. And that's what we're seeing right now.</p>
</details>

Jason Calacanis：我现在的看法是“ChatGPT 对抗全世界”。36个月前，OpenAI 拥有 100% 的市场份额。但他们的市场份额下降速度正在加快。12个月前，他们还占有 84%，现在是 68%。Chamath 正确地指出了原因：分发渠道很重要。Meta 正在强迫你使用他们的 AI 搜索，就像 Slack 曾面临微软捆绑销售 Teams 的竞争一样。我预测未来四年，OpenAI 的市场份额将下降到约三分之一，其他玩家将占据三分之二。原因是专业化正在发生，而且 Sam Altman 树敌太多，从他的合作伙伴微软到前员工，都在试图击败他。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The way I'm sort of seeing this is now chat GPT versus the world 36 months ago, chat GPT, OpenAI had 100%, right? And their decline in market share is increasing in velocity. Uh if we were looking at just 12 months ago, they had 84% of the space and uh now they're at 68. So this is accelerating. You pointed out Chamath correctly why it's accelerating. Distribution matters. Meta is forcing you to use their AI search, just like Slack face competition from Microsoft Teams when it bundled. And so I just tracked this out and this is what I think is going to happen over the next four years. I think we're going to see Open AI go down to about a third of the market and I think the other players are going to take two/3s. The reason I think this is because to Sax's point, specialization's happening. I think what we're going to see here if we're sitting here in the next 12 to 24 months they're going to be under 50%. And these companies are explicitly trying to kill open AI. The amount of bad will that Sam has built is colossal.</p>
</details>

Chamath Palihapitiya：即使只占三分之一的市场，如果这个市场有五六十亿用户，那仍然非常有价值，足以支撑数万亿美元的市值。所以这绝不是 OpenAI 的丧钟。但这确实意味着很多项目可能需要被砍掉，因为你需要把几件事做得非常非常好。消费者会根据特定用途来分散他们的使用决策。比如，我可能会用 Grok Image 处理图像，用 Anthropic 写代码，用 Gemini 做深度研究，再用 ChatGPT 进行对话式搜索。这样一来，我同时使用了四种工具。这是非常现实的结果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They can still be in a good place. I think you're right that this market probably gets split up three or four ways. And so the winner probably gets a third of the market. But a third of a market can still be very valuable if that market has five or six billion people using it. And that can still support a multi-trillion dollar market cap. So I don't think it's by any means a death nail for open AI, but it does mean that a lot of these projects probably need to get shuttered because you need to just do a few things very very well because consumers will start to split their usage decisions across vertical things for specific purposes. So yes, I may use Grock image because I love that and it's just much better. But then I may use Enthropic for codegen while I use Gemini for deep research and then I use chat GPT for conversational search. Now all of a sudden I'm using all four. That's highly realistic that outcome.</p>
</details>

Jason Calacanis：Google 和其他公司正计划釜底抽薪，他们要拿走 OpenAI 的主要收入来源，让其窒息而亡，方法就是免费。目前 OpenAI 80% 的收入来自每月 20 美元的订阅费。我预测 Google 会让 Gemini 的最佳模型终身免费，Meta 也会紧随其后。为什么？因为他们已经有了广告网络。这和当年网景浏览器（Netscape）发生的事情非常相似。人们曾经为网景浏览器支付 50 美元，直到微软进来让它免费。同样的事情也会发生在 ChatGPT 身上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's what Google and other folks are planning. They're going to take the main revenue stream of OpenAI and they're going to suck the oxygen out of the room and they're going to try to strangle Sam and the team over there by making it free. That's my prediction for Google and I think Meta will be right behind them. Why? They have the ad network already built. I think this is going to be very analogous to what happened with Netscape. People used to pay 50 bucks for a Netscape browser and then the idea when Microsoft came in and made it free. Same thing's going to happen to Chat GPT. Right now 80% of the revenue comes from $20 subscriptions. That's going to get decimated to zero. I don't think consumers are going to pay for this product because Google and Meta will make it free.</p>
</details>

Chamath Palihapitiya：我认为原因不同。他们之所以会这么做，是因为他们拥有巨额现金，而这些现金躺在资产负债表上毫无价值。所以你要么花在并购上，要么花在回购上，要么就用来补贴产品，以维持你在更广阔市场中的领导地位。你会看到这些大公司以更激进的方式进行资本配置。股票回购的作用有限，远不如在某个产品类别中展现领导力更能提振股价。如果你想让 Gemini 更上一层楼，那就再给它注入十亿用户。如果这花费你 500 亿美元，没关系，因为你能换来一万亿美元的市值。这是个显而易见的选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's different reason actually. The reason why they will do it, is because they have such an inordinate amount of cash and that cash is valueless on the balance sheet. So you either need to spend it on M&A, spend it on buybacks, or spend it to subsidize a product so that you can maintain your leadership in the broader market. And so what you're going to see is these big companies do this capital allocation model in a much more aggressive way. It just doesn't lift the stock price the same way it does when you actually show leadership in a product category. So if you want to make Gemini even more incredible, just get pour another billion users into it. And if that cost you 50 billion, it's okay because you'll make a trillion of market cap. It's like a no-brainer.</p>
</details>

David Friedberg：我认为这场战斗的胜负不会仅仅取决于大语言模型（LLM）。我们在 AI 领域还处于非常早期的阶段。非文本模型，即非 LLM 模型，其复杂性和差异化程度比 LLM 要大得多。例如，在视频领域，需要多个模型协同工作来渲染视频。因此，在视频 AI 中可能实现的差异化，可以说比我们今天在基于文本的 AI 中看到的要大得多。随着这些技术变得更加主流，我们今天不一定想到的应用将成为我们花费时间的主要用例。到那时，你才会真正看到这场竞赛的走向与今天有所不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think that the battle is going to be won and lost on LLMs. I think that there's several fronts and we're so early in AI. It's not going to necessarily just be about textbased token production. These non-LLM models, the complexity to them and the differentiation is so much wider than it is in LLM. In video for example, right, there are multiple models that have to interact and work together to render video. And so the amount of differentiation that's possible in video AI is I would say this point today so much wider than the differentiation in textbased AI like what we see with LLMs. As those things start to become more mainstream, I think that applications that we are not necessarily thinking about today are going to become a bigger use case for how we spend our time. And that is really when you'll start to see this horse race start to kind of play out a little bit more differently than it does today where everything's all about usage on a chat interface.</p>
</details>

David Sacks：就在几个月前，很多人都在为 Google 唱挽歌。他们认为，即使 Google 能够迎头赶上，也永远无法在 AI 领域拥有像在搜索领域那样的统治地位。但现在，Sergey Brin 回归了，他们变得更加专注，并推出了似乎是最好或最好的模型之一。这说明了这些公司之间正在进行着大量的“蛙跳式”超越。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just a few months ago on this show we were all like giving eulogies for Google. A lot of people were basically saying that this was it for Google because obviously LLMs are so much better at web search than the 10 blue links. And the point that Brad and Bill were making is again, even if Google catches up, they'll never have the dominant position in AI that they have in search. But the point is just everyone was saying that Google was in deep trouble just 6 months ago and then I think Sergey came back and that gave them a major shot in the arm and they got more focused and now they've launched what appears to be the best or one of the best models. But look these other companies there's there's a lot of leaprogging going on.</p>
</details>

David Friedberg：我认为很重要的一点是，这不仅仅是 Sergey 回归的问题，而是他们给了自己承担风险的许可。Google 多年来没有在 AI 领域领先，尽管他们拥有技术，是因为他们担心会蚕食搜索业务，担心产品质量。然后他们改变了姿态，变得更愿意承担风险。这让他们获得了奔跑的许可。而过去几个月，OpenAI 的情况恰恰相反。他们现在表现得像一个 incumbent（在位者），害怕失去市场份额，害怕受到媒体和消费者的攻击。所以他们采取了一种防御姿态，我认为这从根本上损害了产品和品牌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think really importantly it's not just about Sergey coming back it's about giving themselves permission to take risk. The reason Google didn't lead into AI for years, even though they had the technology sacks, is because they were nervous about cannibalization to search, they were nervous about the the quality of the product. And then they changed their posture and they became a more risk-taking posture. And that gave them the permission to run, which by the way, I would argue is the opposite at OpenAI in the last couple of months. Chat GPT is now acting and OpenAI has been acting like an incumbent, fearful of losing market share and fearful of getting attacked in the media and attacked by consumers for saying the wrong thing. And so they've taken this kind of defensive posture that I think has fundamentally damaged the product and the brand.</p>
</details>

### Sacks vs.《纽约时报》：一场关于利益冲突与媒体公信力的交锋

Jason Calacanis：本周末还有另一个重大的科技新闻。《纽约时报》周日发表了一篇题为《硅谷在白宫的代言人正在为自己和朋友谋利》的文章，Sacks 显然就是他们所指的人。据我们所知，有五名记者花了大约五个月的时间来写这篇报道。报道试图将你，Sacks，描绘成有利益冲突的人。首先，你的公司 Craft 在一些公司有投资。其次，报道声称你通过政府职位提升了我们播客 All-In 的知名度。Sacks，很多人认为这篇报道带有偏见，是一次恶意攻击，而且反响平平。你怎么看？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The New York Times versus Mr. David Sachs. On Sunday, the New York Times published an article titled Silicon Valley's man in the White House is benefiting himself and his friends. Saxs are obviously the man they're referring to. Five reporters worked on this story for approximately 5 months is what we hear and the story attempted to frame you Sachs as conflicted first that your firm Craft has investments in companies. Second major claim, raising the profile of Allin. But Saxs, uh, obviously you got a ton of air cover. People thought the story was biased and a hit job and it fell pretty flat. What's your take on this? Maybe take us behind the story.</p>
</details>

David Sacks：我想一个好的起点是看看人们的反应。就像你说的，硅谷有大量的人发声，他们明白这篇报道是一篇恶意攻击，带有偏见，而且最重要的是，它甚至没有兑现自己标题的承诺。所以每个人都能看出来这是一次蓄意抹黑。看到这么多来自硅谷不同的人的支持，感觉很好，包括许多我们刚才谈到的正在激烈竞争的公司。我想这可能是 Sam 和 Elon 在过去一年里唯一达成共识的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think maybe a good place to start is with the reaction to it. Like you said, there was this huge outpouring of people in Silicon Valley who reacted in a way that showed that they understood that this story was a hit piece, that it was biased, and I'd say most importantly, it didn't even live up to its own headline. It didn't prove the thing that they were asserting in the headline. And so, everyone could just see on its face that it was a hatchet job. And it was nice to kind of get that outpouring of support from so many different people in Silicon Valley, including many of the companies who we just talked about are so vigorously competing with each other. I mean, I think this might be the only thing that Sam and Elon have agreed on in the last year.</p>
</details>

David Sacks：我认为这种支持浪潮确实说明了一个重要问题，那就是《纽约时报》失去了多少权力和尊重。十年前，如果《纽约时报》对某人进行恶意攻击，即使其他人不喜欢，他们也不敢说什么，因为他们害怕自己会成为下一个目标。那种神秘感和恐惧感已经完全瓦解了。人们现在能看清《纽约时报》的真面目，它基本上是一群伪装成记者的政治活动家，本质上只是在洗白他们匿名消息来源的观点——那些基本上是左翼民主党人——并试图将这些观点描绘成某种中立或客观的真相。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let me just say I do think that this outpouring of support does illustrate something important which is just how much power and respect the New York Times has lost. You know 10 years ago if the New York Times ran a hit piece on somebody even if other people didn't like it they wouldn't want to say anything because they'd be afraid that they would be the next target. And that mystique and that fear has completely broken down. people can kind of see the New York Times for what it is, which is basically a bunch of political activists who are pretending to be reporters and essentially they just launder the point of view of their anonymous sources who are basically left-wing Democrats and try to portray those viewpoints as somehow being neutral or objective truth.</p>
</details>

Jason Calacanis：有个说法是，你没有把所有投资都放入保密信托（blind trust）。州长 Newsom 昨天也在一个会议上重复了这一点。你能回应一下吗？当你决定接受这个职位时，你采取了哪些行动？法律要求你做什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let me ask you a question. So, one of the statements that was made and then Governor Nuome repeated it at Andrew Ross Orcen Steelbook Conference yesterday is that you did not put all of your investments into a blind trust. You should have done that is what Newsome said on stage. Can you just address that like and what actions you actually took when you chose to take the office? What were you legally required to take?</p>

Chamath Palihapitiya：Sacks，在你回答之前，我只想说一句，因为你自己不会说。我记得你经历这个过程时，你非常担心利益冲突的观感，以至于你采取了非常极端的措施来出售和处理资产，确保你能干净、纯粹地做好这份工作。我亲眼目睹了你做的这一切，我觉得你做得太过火了。我当时想：“天哪，你真的是为了国家在做这件事。” 我对此感到非常震惊和惊讶。

<p class="english-text">Sorry, S. Just give me a second. I just want to say this because you're not going to say this yourself, but I remember when you were going through this, you were so concerned about the perception of a conflict of interest that you took such extraordinary measures about the degree at which you were selling things and getting rid of things to make sure that you could do the job cleanly and holy. I watched you do this and I watched you do something that I thought was so over the top. I'm like, "Holy you really are doing this for the country." And I was so shocked and surprised by it.</p>

David Sacks：这篇报道的核心谎言在于，它不仅不真实，而且是反事实的。事实是，我剥离了数亿美元在有前途的科技企业中的头寸，这对我的净资产造成了巨大损失。所以这份工作不仅没有让我受益，实际上为国效力让我付出了很多钱。但我还是做了，因为被总统邀请服务国家是一种荣誉。关于保密信托的问题，我的伦理法律师说，这个想法很少被使用，而且在我的情况下行不通，因为我有未成年的孩子。冲突法规定，只有当你的孩子是成年人时，你才能使用保密信托让他们成为受益人。所以我没有创建保密信托，而是剥离了这些头寸。

<p class="english-text">That I think is the central lie of this piece. Not only is the piece not true, it's the anti-truth. Because the truth is that I devested hundreds of millions of dollars of positions in promising technology ventures at a substantial cost to my net worth. So not only is this job not benefiting me, it's actually cost me a lot of money to serve, but I did it because it's an honor to be asked by the president to serve. Now, to your question here, on the blind trust. My ethics lawyer who teaches a course on conflicts of interest at Harvard said that that reporter should really take his course because he would actually learn something about the the conflicts laws. The blind trust idea is rarely used and in my case it would not have worked because I have minor children. You can only use the blind trust to have your kids be beneficiaries if they're adults. That's the way the conflict laws work. So it just wasn't even applicable in my case. And what I did instead of creating a blind trust is I devested the positions.</p>

David Sacks：他们提到我有 449 项与 AI 相关的投资，并声称是他们的调查“揭露”了这一点。但他们没有揭露任何东西，这些都是我主动披露的，就放在白宫网站上我的道德信函里。在那封信中，**政府道德办公室**（Office of Government Ethics, OGE: 负责监督和指导美国行政部门道德规范的独立机构）的职业公务员、律师和会计师们批准了这封信，并得出结论，我没有任何冲突。所以，《纽约时报》真正不满的对象是 OGE 的职业公务员。

So really what the New York Times' beef is with the career civil servants at OG.</p>

Chamath Palihapitiya：这篇文章与事实无关。这里没有犯罪，没有烟，也没有火。你唯一说对的是，标题就是他们的目标。那个标题的目标是什么？是暗示和施压 Sacks，但更微妙的是，施压所有像 Sacks 一样的人。这意味着什么？你身处行业，你懂一些非常具体的东西，并且通过运用这些知识取得了成功。现在你突然有机会去积极影响美国的轨迹。这篇文章的作用就是试图恐吓这类人，让他们觉得“这不值得，太麻烦了”。

The goal of that headline is to insinuate and to pressure Sachs, but subtly it's to pressure everyone else that looks like Sachs. Now, what does it mean to look like Sachs? You're in industry. You know something very specific. You've done very well applying that knowledge. Now all of a sudden you're in a position where you could go and positively impact the trajectory of the United States. What this article does is it tries to intimidate those kinds of people to say, "Wow, this is not worth it. This is just too much of a headache."</p>

Chamath Palihapitiya：他们想要的是什么？他们想要的是可以与他们紧密合作并最终被他们收编的人。如果你看看像 Lina Khan 这样被《纽约时报》喜爱的人，共同点是什么？是完全缺乏经验。所以他们创造了一个非常简单的试金石：如果你有经验，我们就会把你描绘成有利益冲突的人，所以离远点。但如果你完全没有经验，我们就会和你合作，让你安然无恙。这就是这篇文章的要点，也是这里受到审判的东西。

Jason Calacanis：这说得太好了。我们现在面临一个选择：我们是想让没有实际经验的律师和学者在华盛顿制定政策，还是想让专家来做？我们想要更多像 Mike Bloomberg、Jeff Bezos、David Sacks 这样的人。我们国家的国父们希望人们短期任职，而不是像 Nancy Pelosi 或 Mitch McConnell 那样做几十年的职业政客。我们希望人们在职业生涯的巅峰时期去华盛顿，为我们服务四到八年，然后回来。你 Sacks 能去那里，是一份礼物。

Do we want to have lawyers and academics with no experience in the real world setting policy in Washington DC or do you want to have experts? Do you want more Mike Bloombergs?

We don't want career politicians like Nancy Pelosi or, you know, Mitch McConnell in there for 30, 40, 600 years. We want people in their prime of their careers to go in there and kick ass for us for four or eight years and then come back. It's a gift that you went there, Sachs. It's a gift.</p>

David Friedberg：托马斯·杰斐逊曾说过，他本性向往科学的宁静追求，但时代的暴行迫使他投身于波涛汹涌的政治激情海洋中。国父们坚信，担任公职是出于为国家服务的需要。看看那些职业政客积累的财富，他们攻击 Sacks 和其他在私营领域取得成功并出于爱国主义承诺而选择服务的人，就不足为奇了。这些人花时间不是为了在私营领域赚钱，而是为了让政府和国家走上他们希望的轨道。

<p class="english-text">There are two quotes from Thomas Jefferson. He said in a letter in 1788, I apprehend that the total abandonment of the principle of rotation in the elected offices will end in abuse. And then he also later said, nature intended me for the tranquil pursuits of science, but the enormities of the times in which I have lived have forced me to take a part in resisting them and to commit myself on the boisterous ocean of political passions. The founding fathers were vehemently committed to the United States being a place where people could pursue with absolute liberty their interests. And the action of political office was out of a requirement to serve out of civil service to this country. And if you look at the wealth that's been accumulated by these career politicians, it is no surprise that they are attacking Sachs and others who have had success in private life and who have chosen out of a commitment to patriotism to spend their time to try and get the government and the country on the track that they hope it will go on.</p>

### 重新定义贫困线：美国中产阶级为何感觉越来越穷？

Jason Calacanis：另一个热门话题是新的贫困线。投资人 Mike Green 上周因声称美国贫困线的计算方法大错特错而走红。历史上，贫困线被定义为 1963 年最低食物开销的三倍，并根据通货膨胀进行调整。基于此，2025 年一个家庭的贫困线设定为 31,000 美元。但 Green 说，真实数字要高出四倍多，达到 140,000 美元。他将育儿成本计算在内，该成本已超过住房成为最大的平均开支。他说，几十年来对这个数字的错误衡量悄悄地摧毁了美国，这或许可以解释为什么尽管 GDP 健康、失业率低，美国中产阶级却感觉越来越穷。Chamath，你的看法？

<details>

<p class="english-text">Another story that's been trending is the new poverty line. Mike Green, an investor and fund manager, went viral last week for claiming the US poverty line math is very wrong. Historically, the poverty line has been measured as three times the cost of a minimum food diet in 1963 adjusted for inflation. Based on that measures, the poverty line for a family is set at $31,000 in 2025. Green says the real number is over 4x higher at 140,000. He gets that number by factoring the cost of childare which has surpassed housing as the largest average expense. He says measuring this number for decades has quietly broken America and it could explain why America's middle class feels poorer despite healthy GDP and historically low unemployment. Chimath, your thoughts.</p>
</details>

Chamath Palihapitiya：我读了这篇文章，觉得他的说法相当惊人，所以我深入研究了一下。基本上，过去食物成本占生活成本的三分之一，所以用食物开销乘以三得出贫困线。但现在食物成本只占 5% 或 6%。所以如果按比例放大其他部分，贫困线是不是应该接近 14 万美元？这是个惊人的说法。后来他澄清了一些说法，比如他看的数据来自纽约市一个高成本的郊区。如果你看一个更具代表性的美国中位数城市，比如弗吉尼亚州的林奇堡，使用麻省理工学院的生活工资计算器，一个四口之家所需收入不是 14 万，而是大约 9.3 万美元。但这仍然是一个巨大的差异。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I read this I found his claim to be pretty shocking. So, I just I wanted to dig into it. Food costs used to be a third of living costs. And so, you would multiply it by three and say, well, the total cost of living is 33,000. That's the poverty line. But what this person was saying is like hey hold on a second food costs are now five or 6%. And so if you gross it up for the other components, shouldn't the poverty line be something closer to 140k? And that's a shocking claim. Now he has subsequently come back and refined some of the things he said. For example, he was looking at a bunch of data from a high-cost suburb of New York City. If you look at a median American city. The example that I think other people were using was Lynchburg, Virginia. You can use this thing called the MIT living wage calculator which we did. And if you are in Lynchburg, Virginia, the income required for a family of four to meet all expenses there is not 140k, but it's about 93k. That's still quite a big difference.</p>
</details>

Chamath Palihapitiya：当你深入研究这些差异的来源时，很多似乎都与住房和育儿有关。我没有意识到育儿成本变得如此昂贵，每月从 1000 到 3000 美元不等。不过，他文章中有一个观点值得我们关注，那就是年收入在 45,000 美元到 63,000 美元之间存在一个“停滞区”。在这个区间，每多赚一美元，往往会导致失去一美元的福利。这确实是我们政策上的失败之处。但好消息是，美国经济似乎在帮助人们不仅摆脱贫困，还摆脱那个“死亡谷”，进入一个收入是贫困线两倍以上的水平。

<p class="english-text">And when you double click into where these variances come, a lot of it looks like it's around housing and childare. And I didn't depreciate how much and how expensive child care has actually become. There is a very specific part of though what he said which I think we should focus on which is there is an area between $45,000 a year and $63,000 a year which actually looks like a bit of a stagnation zone. So to the extent that one is to read this article, the thing that is important is to narrowly focus on this one issue, which is that we do have some policy failures in this zone where earning an extra dollar often results in losing a dollar of benefits. But the good news is the American economy seems to be doing a good job of not just getting people out of poverty, but getting people out of that struggling bracket, out of that death valley, and into a place where they're making 200% of that poverty line.</p>

David Friedberg：这正是社会主义的螺旋。旨在提供支持的政府项目需要增税，税收最终导致该地区经济价值的流失，然后你不得不进一步增税，最终陷入螺旋式下降。我们现在不仅在纽约看到这种情况，整个西海岸都在发生。我们讨论过加州拟议的 5% 亿万富翁税。俄勒冈州州长正试图留住企业。在华盛顿州，一项对年薪超过 12.5 万美元员工征收 5% 工资税的法案正在提议中。微软、亚马逊等大雇主都在考虑对策。

<p class="english-text">This is the spiral of socialism. The government programs that are meant to provide support to people require an increase in taxation. That revenue has to come from somewhere. that taxation ultimately leads to an attrition of economic value in that region and then you have to increase taxation more and then you end up in this spiral and we're seeing this now not just in New York but across the entire West Coast. We talked about the 5% billionaire tax that's being proposed. There's also a major challenge underway in Oregon where the governor is now trying to figure out how to keep businesses in the state. And in Washington, there is a proposed bill right now to implement a 5% tax on the payroll of employees making over $125,000 per year. and Microsoft, Amazon, Costco, and some of the other big employers in that state are now trying to figure out what they should do.</p>

David Friedberg：一旦你依赖政府的某种福利，就很难摆脱。你不会放弃那个福利，所以你必须花越来越多的钱，而当你提高税收时，你最终会失去税基，这就成了一个赤字螺旋。这就是导致社会主义的原因。它不是一场大革命，而是悄然出现，然后变成咆哮，突然间你就像温水里的青蛙，没有意识到自己正在被煮沸。

<p class="english-text">Once you're hooked on the government for some sort of benefit, it's very hard to unhook yourself. You will not give up that benefit. And so you have to spend incrementally more and more and more and more and as you raise taxes, you end up losing the tax base and it becomes a deficit spiral. That's what leads to socialism. And we have seen it time and again. It's not a big revolution. Socialism emerges slowly. It's like a quiet sort of hum and then it becomes a roar and all of a sudden you're a frog in a pot and you don't realize you're being boiled.</p>

David Friedberg：民主制度的终结往往不是轰轰烈烈，而是悄无声息。进步的问题在于它是不对称的。一些人的进步速度远超大多数人，正是这种差距最终导致了制度的终结。虽然美国普通人甚至底层四分之一的人口比 50 年前过得更好，但顶层 1% 的人领先中位数的幅度更大了。正是这种差距被认为是这个治理体系不公平的地方，最终导致法西斯主义或社会主义。

<p class="english-text">I don't think democracies end with a bang. I think they end with a whimper. The problem with progress is that progress is asymmetric. You have some people who progress at a much greater rate than most. And and it is that delta that motivates the end of that system ultimately. While everyone in the United States or the average and even the bottom quartile of the population in the US is better off than they were 50 years ago. The top 1% of the US is further ahead than the median. And it is that delta that motivates the end of democracy. And it is that is which is then perceived to be be unfair about this governing system. And that ultimately results in fascism or or socialism.</p>

<p class="english-text">What do you think happens if Fitch just tax 5% of all net worth and you have a bunch of illquid private assets? What are you supposed to do?</p>

David Friedberg：问题不止于此。这项法案实际上赋予了加州立法机构未来以不同水平和税率重新制定这项财富税的权力和授权。想想这意味着什么。它现在赋予了加州立法机构财产扣押权。很快，任何净资产超过一亿美元，然后是一千万美元，再然后是一百万美元的人，州政府每年都可以拿走你 5% 的资产。这很快就会成为政府没收资产、实现社会主义化的过程。

<p class="english-text">And it doesn't it doesn't stop there. So, think about where this goes. In the proposed billionaire tax, it actually gives power and authority to the California state legislature that they can actually redo this wealth tax at a different level and a different rate in the future. Think about what that does. It now gives property seizure rights to the California state legislature to set a value level. So anyone now that's got over a hundred million net worth and then it becomes over 10 million and then anyone with a million dollar net worth and the state can take 5% of your assets every year. very quickly it becomes the process by which socialism and the socialization of assets that gets seized by the government is realized.</p>

Jason Calacanis：我理解人们的感受，财富差距确实存在。但我认为，如果我们解决了住房、教育和医疗保健这三大问题，情况会大不相同。在德克萨斯州和佛罗里达州，他们允许你建造房屋供应，人们就不会对自己的生活状况感觉那么糟糕。如果我们解决了学费问题，让贷款与成果挂钩。如果人们不担心因医疗而破产，我想我们的国家会大不相同。我认为 2028 年的公投将围绕这三个问题展开。

<p class="english-text">Let me give it to you. I understand that's how people feel and it is true that we have this disparity in wealth. I think the counterargument that most people would make is well what is our unemployment rate? If we didn't have the problem with housing and education and healthcare, those are the big three. That's what I think this is really about. If you solve housing, which was solved in Texas and Florida and Nevada, they let you build supply. People don't feel as bad about their lot in life. If we solved tuition and we paired it, like we've talked about countless times here, and the loans matched the outcomes, we would not have this. And if people felt didn't feel the fear of going bankrupt from healthcare, I think we would have a much different country. I think that's what the referendum is going to be in 2028 is those three issues.</p>
