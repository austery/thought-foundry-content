### 格陵兰岛主权争议

**Tracy Mumford**: 来自《纽约时报》，为您播报头条新闻。我是 Tracy Mumford。今天，星期四，1月22日。以下是我们要报道的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Thursday, January 22nd. Here's what we're covering.

</details>

**Reporter 1**: 美国所要求的一切，就是一个叫做格陵兰岛的地方，而我们已经拥有它了。昨天在达沃斯，一个汇聚了世界上最富有和最有权势人物的聚会上，特朗普总统承诺，如果美国不能完全拥有格陵兰岛，将会带来后果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter 1**: All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland where we already had it. At Davos yesterday, a gathering of the world's most rich and powerful, President Trump promised there would be consequences if the US doesn't get full ownership of Greenland.

</details>

**Trump**: 你们可以同意，我们将非常感激；或者你们可以拒绝，我们将铭记在心。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Trump**: You can say yes and we will be very appreciative or you can say no and we will remember.

</details>

**Reporter 1**: 不过，他以谈论一项协议结束了这一天。他说，他已经与**北约**就该岛的未来达成了协议框架。这是否还包括你曾说想要的美国拥有格陵兰岛的条款？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter 1**: He ended the day though with talk of a deal. He said that he'd reached the framework of an agreement with NATO over the island's future. Does it still include the United States having ownership of Greenland like you've said you wanted?

</details>

**Source**: 嗯，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Source**: Uh,

</details>

**Source**: 这是个长期协议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Source**: it's a long-term deal.

</details>

**Source**: 这是终极的长期协议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Source**: It's the ultimate long-term deal.

</details>

**Reporter 1**: 特朗普没有提供该框架的任何细节，但这一声明似乎让美国从公开对抗的边缘退了回来。特朗普撤回了他威胁要对那些反对他的国家征收关税的言论，并表示他不会使用武力从**丹麦**手中夺取格陵兰岛。**北约**也没有提供关于该协议的具体细节，但官员们告诉《泰晤士报》，本周早些时候，一些**北约**成员国一直在考虑一项可能的折衷方案，即给予美国对格陵兰岛部分地区的主权，用于建立军事基地。缺乏具体细节引发了一些人的困惑和担忧。一位格陵兰议员拒绝了特朗普关于达成协议的说法，并表示，“没有我们，就不能做决定。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter 1**: Trump didn't provide any details of what's in that framework, but the announcement seems to walk the US back from the brink of open confrontation. Trump withdrew his threat of slapping tariffs on countries that stood up to him and said he would not use force to take Greenland from Denmark. NATO didn't offer specifics about the deal either, but officials tell the Times that earlier this week some NATO members had been looking at a possible compromise of giving the US sovereignty over small pockets of Greenland for military bases. The lack of concrete details has sparked confusion and concern for some. One Greenlandic lawmaker rejected Trump's talk of a deal, saying, quote, "Nothing about us without us."

### 特朗普的“和平委员会”

**Reporter 2**: 与此同时，这个委员会有可能成为有史以来最具影响力的机构之一，我很荣幸能担任其主席。他们邀请我时，我感到非常荣幸。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter 2**: Meanwhile, this board has the chance to be one of the most consequential bodies ever created, and it's my enormous honor to serve as its chairman. I was very honored when they asked me to do it.

</details>

**Reporter 2**: 今天上午在瑞士，特朗普举行了一个他称之为“**和平委员会**”的签署仪式。虽然最初提议该委员会负责监督**加沙**的重建工作，但《泰晤士报》看到了拟议的章程，该章程显示其范围要大得多。章程规定，该委员会将确保受冲突影响或威胁的地区实现持久和平，使其有可能与**联合国安理会**的任务相匹敌。这将是总统拆除自**第二次世界大战**以来建立的国际体系并将其置于新体系中心的一个例子。根据章程，一个人拥有否决决定、邀请成员、指定其继任者或完全解散委员会的权力，那就是**唐纳德·特朗普**。一位美国官员也证实，即使在他总统任期结束后，特朗普仍可能发挥核心作用，并表示他可以继续担任该委员会的主席，直到他决定辞职。**沙特阿拉伯**、**以色列**、**白俄罗斯**以及其他几个国家已表示将加入。**俄罗斯**和**中国**也已被邀请。尚不清楚他们会怎么做。而包括**法国**在内的一些国家则表示拒绝。之后，特朗普威胁**法国**对其葡萄酒征收200%的关税。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter 2**: This morning in Switzerland, Trump held a signing ceremony for what he's called the Board of Peace. While it was initially proposed as a group that would oversee the rebuilding of Gaza, the Times got a look at the proposed charter, which shows a much bigger scope. It says the board will secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict, putting it on track to potentially rival the mission of the United Nations Security Council. It would be an example of the president dismantling the international system that's been in place since World War War II and putting himself at the center of a new one. According to the charter, one person has the power to veto decisions, invite members, designate his successor, or dissolve the board entirely, Donald Trump. A US official also confirmed Trump could play a central role even after his presidency is over, saying he can stay on as chair of the board until he decides to resign. Saudi Arabia, Israel, Bellarus, and several more countries have said they're joining. Russia, and China have also been invited. It's unclear what they'll do. And some countries, including France, have said no. After which Trump threatened France with 200% tariffs on wine.

### 特朗普支持率下滑

**Reporter 3**: 今天早上公布的一项新的**时代-锡耶纳民意调查**显示，特朗普总统的支持率正在下滑，只有大约三分之一的选民认为国家比他一年前上任时过得更好。近一半的人认为情况更糟。大多数选民不赞成他处理从移民到经济的一系列问题的方式。一半的美国人表示，特朗普的政策让他们生活负担更重。值得注意的是，特朗普在年轻选民和非白人选民中失去了大量支持，而这些群体曾帮助他赢得第二个任期。尽管如此，特朗普仍然在共和党人中保持着压倒性的支持。近一半的共和党人认为他是美国历史上最伟大的总统之一，一位选民告诉《泰晤士报》：“当有这么多人反对他时，他一定做对了什么。”你可以在 nytimes.com 上找到民意调查的完整结果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter 3**: A new Time Sienna poll out this morning shows that President Trump's approval rating is falling and that only about a third of voters think the country is better off than it was when he took office a year ago. Almost half think it's worse. A majority of voters disapprove of how he's handled a range of issues from immigration to the economy. Half of Americans say Trump's policies have made life less affordable for them. Notably, Trump has lost significant support among younger voters and non-white voters, groups who helped him clinch a second term. Still, Trump has managed to retain overwhelming support among Republicans. Almost half view him as one of the best presidents in US history with one voter telling the Times quote he must be doing something right when there are so many people opposed to him. You can find the full results of the poll at ny times.com.

### 缅因州移民执法

**Tracy Mumford**: 现在，关于联邦政府还有两个快速更新。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Now two more quick updates on the federal government.

</details>

**Reporter 4**: 人们感到害怕。他们很恐惧。想象一下，你是一位家长，你出门送孩子去坐校车。等你转过身来，你已经被**ICE**特工包围了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter 4**: People are afraid. They are scared. Imagine you are a parent and you step out to put your kid in a school bus. By the time you turn around, you are surrounded by ICE agents.

</details>

**Reporter 4**: **缅因州**的当地官员表示，该州的移民社区正处于紧张状态，因为特朗普政府已将该州作为其加强移民执法行动的最新重点。一位**ICE**官员告诉**福克斯新闻**，该机构在**缅因州**约有1400个“目标”。本周已开始逮捕行动。近年来，一些来自非洲国家的寻求庇护者已迁往该州，**《泰晤士报》**获悉，该州的**ICE**行动部分目标是来自**索马里**的移民。特朗普总统曾多次发表排外言论，称他们为“垃圾”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter 4**: Local officials in Maine say that immigrant communities there are on edge as the Trump administration has made that state the latest focus of its ramped up immigration enforcement operations. An ICE official told Fox News that the agency has approximately 1,400 quote targets in Maine. It started making arrests this week. A number of asylum seekers from African countries have moved to the state in recent years, and the Times has learned that the ICE operation there is aimed in part at immigrants from Somalia. President Trump has railed against them repeatedly in xenophobic comments, calling them garbage.

### 克林顿夫妇面临传唤投票

**Reporter 5**: 并且，委员会特此有利地报告并采纳本报告，建议众议院在藐视**国会**方面认定**威廉·J·克林顿**有罪。昨天在**众议院**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter 5**: And the committee hereby favorably reports and adopts this report, recommending that the House of Representatives find William J. Clinton in contempt of Congress. in the House of Representatives yesterday.

</details>

**Reporter 5**: 现在的问题是，是否要对**希拉里·R·克林顿**的藐视报告做出不利报告。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter 5**: The question is now unfavorably reporting the Hillary R. Clinton contempt report.

</details>

**Reporter 5**: 监督委员会采取了一项非同寻常的步骤，建议对**比尔和希拉里·克林顿**因拒绝在其**杰弗里·爱泼斯坦**调查中作证而对其提起刑事藐视**国会**的指控。克林顿夫妇指责该委员会的共和党主席出于政治目的针对他们。他们表示，他们已经提供了宣誓证词，并且不会同意在委员会面前作证。经过昨天一整天的激烈辩论，多名民主党人与共和党人一起支持将他们因拒绝作证而认定为藐视**国会**的努力。一些人表示，特别是**比尔·克林顿**应该回答关于他与**爱泼斯坦**社交的问题。他们的投票反映出一种不愿被视为是在为任何与被定罪的性犯罪者有关联的人辩护。然而，其他民主党人表示，该委员会实行双重标准，并且没有足够努力调查特朗普总统与**爱泼斯坦**的关系，也没有向司法部施压以发布所有**爱泼斯坦**文件，而司法部至今仍未做到。**众议院**全体现在将考虑是否将克林顿夫妇移交给司法部进行起诉。如果被定罪，他们可能面临高达10万美元的罚款和一年监禁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter 5**: The oversight committee took an extraordinary step in recommending that Bill and Hillary Clinton be charged with criminal contempt for refusing to testify in its Jeffrey Epstein investigation. The Clintons have accused the Republican chair of the committee of targeting them for political purposes. They said they'd already provided sworn statements and would not agree to testify before the committee. After a heated day-long debate yesterday, multiple Democrats joined Republicans in supporting the effort to hold them in contempt for that. Some said that Bill Clinton in particular should answer questions about the time he spent socializing with Epstein. Their votes reflected a reluctance to be seen as defending anyone associated with a convicted sex offender. Other Democrats, however, said that the committee was applying a double standard and not doing enough to investigate President Trump's ties to Epstein or to pressure the Justice Department to release all the Epstein files, which it has still failed to do. The full House of Representatives will now consider whether or not to refer the Clintons to the Department of Justice for prosecution. If convicted, they could face up to a $100,000 fine and one year in prison.

### 伊朗抗议活动被镇压

**Reporter 6**: 在**伊朗**，政府官员已宣布，一些人认为可能推翻威权政权的广泛抗议活动已被镇压。**伊朗**总检察长表示，“叛乱现在已经结束”，该国外交部长声称“我们街道上的暴力已经平息”。这场运动始于上个月，是对该国经济崩溃的回应，并导致了数周的动荡，大批**伊朗**人走上街头，焚烧政府大楼，高喊“打倒独裁者”。当局以残酷的镇压回应。在某些时候，视频显示他们向手无寸铁的抗议者开枪。据估计，有超过4500人被杀。但政府切断了互联网接入，使得难以获得事件的完整情况。现在，**伊朗**官员已誓言要惩罚那些他们声称对**伊朗**抗议活动负责的人。他们称他们为恐怖分子和煽动者，声称他们得到了**美国**和**以色列**等外国政府的支持。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter 6**: In Iran, government officials have declared that the widespread protests, which some thought might take down the authoritarian regime, have been crushed. Iran's prosecutor general said, quote, "The sedition is over now, and the country's foreign minister has claimed that the violence on our streets has subsided." The movement had kicked off last month in response to the country's collapsing economy and led to weeks of unrest with huge crowds of Iranians taking to the streets, burning government buildings and shouting death to the dictator. Authorities responded with a brutal crackdown. At some points, video showed them opening fire on unarmed protesters. By one estimate, more than 4,500 people were killed. But the government cut internet access, making it difficult to get a full account of what's happened. Now, Iranian officials have vowed to punish people who they say were responsible for the protests. They've called them terrorists and provocators, claiming they were backed by foreign governments like the US and Israel.

### AI 简历筛选诉讼

**Reporter 7**: 最后，最近申请过工作的人可能都知道那种提交申请后，却在想**人工智能**是否会在人类看到你的简历之前就将其过滤掉的感觉。也许你甚至在申请后10分钟就收到了拒绝通知，并想：“等等，为什么？怎么回事？”感觉就像一个黑箱。现在，一群求职者正在对此进行反击。他们对一家特定的招聘筛选公司提起了诉讼，该公司从**LinkedIn**等来源收集数据。然后，该软件会评估人们的技能，并对每位申请者进行1到5分的评分。诉讼声称，这基本上就像一个信用评分。因此，就像信用评分一样，人们有权知道它是什么。**国会**在1970年制定了《公平信用报告法》，以确保人们能够查询自己的分数并对错误进行争议。求职者想要同样的东西，特别是如果**人工智能**弄错了什么。一位原告告诉《泰晤士报》：“我认为我应该知道关于我的哪些信息被收集并与雇主分享。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter 7**: And finally, anyone who has applied for a job recently probably knows the feeling of hitting submit and wondering if AI is just going to filter your resume out before a human ever sees it. Maybe you've even gotten a rejection 10 minutes after applying and wondered, "Wait, why? How?" Can feel like a black box. And a group of job seekers is now pushing back on that. They filed a lawsuit against one particular screening company which pulls together data from sources like LinkedIn. The software then evaluates people's skills and scores each applicant on a scale of 1 to 5. The suit claims that's basically like a credit score. And so like credit scores, people have a right to know what it is. Congress put the Fair Credit Reporting Act in place back in 1970 to make sure people could ask for their scores and dispute them if there were any errors. The job seekers want the same thing, especially if AI is getting something wrong. One plaintiff told the Times, "I think I deserve to know what's being collected about me and shared with employers."
