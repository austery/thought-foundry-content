### 阿尔茨海默病：30岁开始的隐形杀手

**主持人**: 我们面前有这种白色粉末。你脸上带着大大的笑容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And we have this white powder in front of me. You got a big smile on your face.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的，因为我不在乎你是谁，你绝对应该服用这个。我们来谈谈**肌酸**。出色的研究表明，你可以通过服用肌酸来摆脱**睡眠不足**。它可以保护你的大脑免受**脑震荡**、**中风**和**压力**的影响。有一项针对**阿尔茨海默病**患者的研究发现，患者不仅保留了他们的**认知功能**，而且精力更充沛，能够进行更多的锻炼。我之所以知道这些，是因为我是一名临床医生，在过去十年里，我一直与世界上最伟大的神经外科医生一起研究大脑。我在这里要解决一个疾病，那就是**阿尔茨海默病**，因为它通常在30多岁时开始，全球有6000万人患有阿尔茨海默病，其中70%是女性。我感到愤怒和充满热情，因为女性一直被欺骗、被低估。她们轻视自己的症状，或者太害怕向医生寻求建议。人们真正不知道的是，这是一种可以预防的疾病，但它就像晚期癌症。一旦你得到诊断，就没有治愈方法。这么多人受制于一种可预防的疾病，这让我无法接受。我认为人们不理解这些事情。比如，人们不知道我们正变得越来越**久坐不动**，这本身就是一种疾病。有一项研究表明，如果你每小时做10个**空气深蹲**，这可以弥补你的久坐生活方式。此外，我们还有几种生活方式因素可以降低患阿尔茨海默病的风险，以及每天5分钟如何改善你的大脑表现，只需使用一个网球和一个眼罩。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: I do because I don't care who you are, you should definitely be having this. Let's talk about **creatine**. Phenomenal research shows you can creatine your way out of **sleep deprivation**. It can protect your brain against a **concussion**, **stroke**, from **stress**. And there was a study done on **Alzheimer's disease** patients. And they found that patients not only preserved their **cognitive functions**, but they had more energy and they were able to exercise more. And I know this because I'm a clinician and over the last decade I've been surrounded by the greatest neurosurgeons in the world studying the brain. And so I'm here to tackle one disease and that is **Alzheimer's** because it generally starts in our 30s and 60 million people worldwide have Alzheimer's. 70% being women. And I get angry and I get passionate because women have been lied to. They've been underrepresented. They downplay their symptoms or they're too scared to ask their doctor for advice. And what people don't really know is that it is a preventable disease, but it's like endstage cancer. Once you get the diagnosis, there is no cure. And the fact that so many people are at the mercy of a disease that is preventable is not okay with me. And I don't think people understand these things. Like people don't really know that we're becoming more **sedentary**, which is a disease. And there was a study that was done on this that showed that if you do **10 air squats** every hour, this can compensate for your sedentary lifestyle. And then we have several lifestyle factors that can lower your risk of getting Alzheimer's disease, as well as showing you what 5 minutes a day can do for your brain performance. Just using a tennis ball and an eye patch.

</details>

**主持人**: Louisa，简单来说，你是做什么的？最重要的是，你为什么要做这件事？为什么是现在？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Louisa, what is it you do in simple terms? And I guess most importantly, why is it that you do it? And why now?

</details>

**Louisa**: 在过去十年里，我一直在研究大脑。我既是临床医生也是学者。所以我既能观察大脑，也能研究它。我真正想解决的是一种疾病，那就是**阿尔茨海默病**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Over the last decade, I've been studying the brain. I'm both a clinician and an academic. So, I get to see the brain and I also get to research it. And I'm really here to tackle one disease and that is Alzheimer's disease.

</details>

**主持人**: 为什么现在这件事如此重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Why is this so important now?

</details>

**Louisa**: 现在很重要，因为全球有6000万人患有**阿尔茨海默病**。到2050年，这个数字将增加两倍。到2050年，将有1.1亿女性患有阿尔茨海默病。这种疾病会剥夺你的自我，你的完整身份。所以，我们马上深入探讨这个问题，因为我带了**Henry**来，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Right now because 60 million people worldwide have Alzheimer's disease. That number is going to triple by the year 2050. 110 million women will have Alzheimer's disease by the year 2050. This is a disease that robs you of who you are, your complete identity. So, we're going to get really into this straight away cuz I brought Henry with me, right?

</details>

**主持人**: 对于看不到的人来说，**Henry**是她手里拿着的一个大脑模型。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And for anyone that can't see, Henry is a model brain that she's holding in her hands.

</details>

**Louisa**: 这个大约有2磅重。如果你真正感受它，你知道，如果你真正感受一个真实的人脑，它感觉像豆腐，但这代表着你的一切。这么多人受制于一种可预防的疾病，这让我无法接受。这让我很不舒服。我们过去认为女性更容易受到**阿尔茨海默病**的影响，因为我们寿命更长，因为年龄在其中起作用。但我们现在有充分证据表明，这并非因为女性寿命更长，或者普遍人群寿命更长，因为**痴呆症**和阿尔茨海默病并非大脑自然老化过程的一部分。对于女性来说，她们与男性不同，我们可以将性别分开讨论，对于女性来说，仅仅因为是女性就是患上这种疾病的一个风险因素。现在，如果我们回顾一下所有目前患有**阿尔茨海默病**的人，其中95%的病例是可以预防的，因为这并非一种遗传性疾病，而是一种生活方式疾病。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: This is around 2 lb. And if you actually feel it and you know, if you actually feel a real human brain, it feels like tofu, but this is everything you are. And the fact that so many people are at the mercy of a disease that is preventable is not okay with me. It doesn't sit well with me. We used to think that women were disproportionately affected by Alzheimer's disease because we lived longer because age played a role in it. But we now have substantial evidence to show that it's not the fact that women live longer or people in general because dementia and Alzheimer's disease are not part of the natural brain aging process. For women, and they differ from men, and we can separate the sexes and talk about it, for women, it is purely because being a woman is a risk factor for getting this disease. Now, if we go through and we have a look at all of the people that currently have Alzheimer's disease, 95% of them could have been prevented because this is not a disease of genetics. It's a disease of lifestyle.

</details>

**主持人**: 95%的病例可以预防？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: 95% of it could have been prevented.

</details>

**Louisa**: 对吗？我们生来就带有自己的基因构成。这意味着，例如，如果你在4号染色体上有一个基因突变，你就会患上**亨廷顿病**。对此我们无能为力。你生来就是如此。但谈到**阿尔茨海默病**，大约有20到30个基因与这种疾病有关。目前只有大约3%的疾病病例是由这些基因突变引起的。你出生时就带有的基因突变，你从父母那里继承的，是**早老素1**、**早老素2**和**淀粉样前体蛋白**。所以如果你在这些基因中的一个有基因突变，你就会患上某种形式的**痴呆症**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Correct? We're we're born with our with our genetic makeup. Meaning that, for example, if you have a genetic mutation on chromosome 4, you will get **Huntington's disease**. There is nothing we can do about that. That's how you were born. But when it comes to Alzheimer's disease, there's around 20 to 30 genes involved in the disease. Only around 3% of the disease cases right now were driven through those genetic mutations. The genetic mutations that you are born with, you get them from mom and dad are **presinelin one**, **presinelin 2** and the **amaloid precursor protein**. So you if you have a genetic mutation in one of these genes, you will get some form of dementia.

</details>

**主持人**: 人们开始经历**阿尔茨海默病**的年龄范围是多大？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: What is the age range where people will start to experience Alzheimer's?

</details>

**Louisa**: 让我们先对**阿尔茨海默病**有一个全面的了解。好的。你可能听说过**痴呆症**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Let's just actually take a broad overview of what Alzheimer's disease is. Okay. So you've probably heard of dementia. Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以**痴呆症**是一个总称。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So dementia is the umbrella term. So

</details>

**Louisa**: 所以**阿尔茨海默病**属于这个总称之下。它是一种**痴呆症**。还有**额颞叶痴呆**，那是**布鲁斯·威利斯**所患的。还有**路易体痴呆**。还有**帕金森痴呆**。还有**血管性痴呆**。这种疾病，**痴呆症**或**阿尔茨海默病**，是一种中年疾病。所以它通常在我们的30多岁开始。它在我们的30多岁开始，但最初的症状出现在我们60多岁、70多岁及以后。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Alzheimer's disease is sits under the umbrella. It's a form of dementia. There's **fronttotemporal dementia** which is what **Bruce Willis** has. There's **dementia with Louis bodies**. There's **Parkinson's dementia**. There's **vascular dementia**. This disease dementia or Alzheimer's disease is a disease of midlife. And so it generally starts in our 30s. It starts in our 30s, but the first symptoms show up in our late 60s, 70s and beyond.

</details>

**主持人**: 当你说它开始时，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: When you say it starts,

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的，我们的大脑在大约25岁时完全发育。25到30岁。在那之后，如果我们不照顾好我们的大脑，这些功能就会开始下降。现在我们回到大脑。大脑有870亿个神经元，每个神经元大约有5000到10000个连接。我最喜欢的大脑区域是**小脑**。小脑内的**浦肯野细胞**每个细胞有超过50000个连接。所以它非常密集，发生着很多事情。它消耗你每天摄入总卡路里的20%来驱动这个器官。它是全身血管最丰富的器官。随着时间的推移，通过**睡眠不足**、**不良饮食**、**缺乏体育活动**、**环境毒素**等因素，大脑的功能会慢慢受损。随着时间的推移，这会开始累积，因为这就是生物学。一切都在累积。一晚上的睡眠不足会使你患**淀粉样β蛋白**的风险增加4%，淀粉样β蛋白是**阿尔茨海默病病理学**的标志之一。那只是一晚上的睡眠不足。想象一下一个新妈妈、一个轮班工人或一个住院医生日复一日地经历无数个夜晚的睡眠不足。想象一下所有这些累积起来。会发生什么？我们会出现**神经元损失**，这就像大脑某些部分的完全萎缩。这就是**轻度认知障碍**。轻度认知障碍是一种**痴呆前期**状态。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yeah, our brain fully develops at around 25 years old. 25 to 30. And after that that's when we if we don't take care of our brain we start getting a decline in these functions. Now let's go back to the brain. The brain is 87 billion neurons around 5 to 10,000 connections per neuron. The my favorite area of the brain is the **cerebellum**. And the **piking cells** inside the cerebellum have upwards of 50,000 connections per cell. So so tightly dense and there is so much happening. It takes 20% of the total calories that you consume every day to power this thing. And it's the most vascular richch organ in the entire body. Over time, through things such as **sleep deprivation**, **poor diet**, **lack of physical activity**, **environmental toxins**, this slowly erodess at the functioning of the brain. And over time, this starts to compound because that's what biology is. Everything is compounding. One night of sleep deprivation raises your risk of **amaloid beta**, which is one of the hallmarks of **Alzheimer's disease pathology**, by 4%. That's just one night of sleep deprivation. Imagine a new mother or a shift worker or a physician in their residency getting countless nights of sleep deprivation day in and day out. Imagine all of that compounding. And what happens? Well, we end up with either **neuronal loss**, which is like the complete atrophy of certain parts of the brain. And that's what is **mild cognitive impairment**. Mild cognitive impairment is a **pre-dementure** state.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么，我这里拿的这张大脑照片是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So, what is this that I have here? This photo um of a brain.

</details>

**Louisa**: 你现在看到的是大脑的**矢状视图**。我们看到的是一个健康的大脑。如你所见，我将在这里左侧展示它。你可以看到大脑很厚。我们可以看到**灰质**的完整性很厚。它很饱满。好的。我们可以看到**脑室**更小。我们再看这边，我们看到**皮层变薄**。你可以看到**脑回**之间有很大的空间。这些变厚是因为灰质已经萎缩了。它缩小了。你可以看到皮层本身和颅骨之间的空间变大了。你可以看到这里的**脑室**，这些蝴蝶状的脑室。这边更厚。这边更薄。我们可以在这里看到萎缩。所以本质上，大脑正在变得越来越小。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: You've got the **sagittal view** right now of the brain. And we're looking at a healthy brain on here. As you can see, I'm going to show it up here on the left hand side. You can see that the brain is thick. We can see that the integrity of the **gray matter** which sits out here is thick. It's voluous. Okay. We can see that the **ventricles** are smaller. We go over here and we see **thinning of the cortex**. You can see these big spaces between the **gy**. These are thick because the gray matter has atrophied. It's shrunk. You can see that the space between the cortex itself and the skull, there's a bigger space. You can see these ventricles here, these butterflyshaped ventricles. This is thicker. This is thinner. We can see atrophy down here. So essentially, the brain is getting smaller and smaller.

</details>

### 认知储备与生活方式

**主持人**: 如果我在30岁时做对了所有事情，我们把它绘制在图表上，看看我70岁时会是什么样子，我70岁时的结果会有多大差异？你知道，我的大脑对我来说非常重要。我确实很担心。我想，我担心一部分原因是我坐下来采访很多人，他们年龄各异，作为一名采访者，你会注意到一件事，那就是有些60岁的人思维非常敏锐。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: at the age of 30. If I do everything right, and we were to sort of plot this on a graph of where I land at 70, what is the variance of where I'll end up at 70? You know, my brain is quite important to me. And I do worry. I think like I think I worry in part because I I I sit and interview a lot of people at a lot of different ages and one thing you notice as an interviewer is some people at 60 have are razor sharp.

</details>

**Louisa**: 而有些60岁的人则不那么敏锐。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: and some people at 60 are not as razor sharp.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 他们表达词语的能力、记忆力、理解统计数据和故事的能力，所有这些。我坐在这里想，我想知道区别在哪里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Their ability to articulate their words, their memory recall, their ability to understand stats and stories, all of this. And I sit here and go, I wonder what the difference is.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的。这实际上很棒，因为它引出了神经科学中一个重要的概念，叫做**认知储备**。这是你的大脑抵抗压力、克服压力的能力。好的。你可能听说过，例如，我们用身体表现的类比，你的**V2 Max**，它是衡量你最大呼吸健康水平的指标。你知道你在高强度状态下如何有效地利用氧气。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yeah. And that's actually beautiful because it brings up this important concept in neuroscience called **cognitive reserve**. And that's your brain's ability to withhold capacity to overcome stresses. Okay. So you've probably heard for example, let's use the analogy of physical performance, your **V2 max**, which is a measure of your peak respiratory fitness. You know how well you can utilize oxygen.

</details>

**主持人**: 当你处于高强度状态时，你的身体如何有效地利用氧气？你越健康，你抵抗压力的储备就越多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: when you are at a at a high intensity state. How well does your body utilize oxygen? The the fitter you are, the more reserve you have to overcome stress.

</details>

**Louisa**: 压力，例如感染、日常压力、**睡眠不足**、手术，你银行里储备越多，就能克服越多。你的大脑也是如此。你拥有的**认知储备**越多，你年复一年训练的**认知能力**就越多，这将使你在60岁时免受有害的侵害，例如，一个80岁的女性可能大脑充满了**淀粉样β蛋白**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Stress such as an infection, everyday stresses, sleep deprivation, surgery, the more reserve you have in your bank to overcome that. The same is with your brain. The more cognitive reserve that you have, the more cognitive capacity that you have been training year on and year out will save you at 60 from harmful insults such as you can get a woman at the age of 80 with a head full of **amaloid beta**.

</details>

**主持人**: **淀粉样β蛋白**是？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Amaloid beta being

</details>

**Louisa**: 它是**阿尔茨海默病**的标志之一。你可以看到一个大脑充满**淀粉样蛋白**的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: the one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. You can get somebody with a head full of amaloid.

</details>

**主持人**: 它就像大脑上的斑块。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: which is like a plaque on the brain.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的，它是一种蛋白质，它实际上是一种存在于神经元内部的蛋白质，我们可以在稍后解释它是什么，但我只想告诉你，一个人可以大脑充满**淀粉样蛋白**，但他们保留了**认知功能**，而另一个人几乎没有淀粉样蛋白，但他们失去了认知功能，这都归结为**认知储备**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yeah. it it's a protein that's actually it's a it's a protein that lives inside the neuron itself and we can explain what that is which I will in a second but let me just tell you you can have a head full of amaloid in this person and they have retained their cognitive functions then you can have somebody else with hardly any amaloid but they've lost their cognitive functions and this all comes down to cognitive reserve.

</details>

**主持人**: **认知储备**存在于大脑的哪个部位？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: and cognitive reserve lives where in the head.

</details>

**Louisa**: 每个细胞大约有5000到10000个连接。随着时间的推移，这些连接会失效。这些连接负责你的思维和**处理速度**。每次你产生一个想法，你就会建立一个新的连接。你拥有的连接越多，你看到的事物越多，你给大脑的新奇刺激越多，它就越丰富，越稳定。所以，这些神经元的末端，我们有**树突**。从树突上长出这些小树。想象一根树枝。那是树突。所有从上面长出来的叶子，所有这些小的**树突树**，如果你愿意，它们连接到附近的细胞，10000个细胞，随着时间的推移，这些连接会断裂。这些连接会失效。它们失效是因为你没有利用它们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: you've got around 5 to 10,000 connections per cell. Over time, those connections fail. Now, those connections are responsible for your thinking, your **processing speed**. Every time you have a thought, you build a new connection. The more connections that you have, the more things that you see, the more novelty that you give your brain, the richer it gets, the more stable it gets. So, the ends of these of the neurons, we have **dendrites**. And coming off the dendrites are these little trees. Imagine a branch. That's the dendrite. And all of the leaves that come off it, all these little **dendritic trees**, if you will, and they connect to nearby cells, 10 10,000 cells over time, those are the connections that fall. Those are the connections that fail. They fail because you don't utilize them.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么，一个人在30岁时建立储备的方式是？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So, the way that one would build reserve at the age of 30 is to

</details>

**Louisa**: 是通过**锻炼**。我们可以通过多种不同的方式建立储备。事实上，最近有一项非常棒的研究，我刚刚读到，他们发现那些在75岁时保持**认知能力**的人，是因为他们坚持**手写和阅读**。所以，手写和阅读可以保持认知功能。**锻炼**是促进大脑健康、预防**阿尔茨海默病**和增加**认知储备**最有效的刺激之一。你锻炼得越多，你的大脑就越大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: is by **exercising**. We can build reserve in a number of different ways. In fact, there was a really wonderful study that just came out that I just read about and they found that those who preserved **cognitive capacity** at 75 years old were **handwriting and reading**. So, handwriting and reading preserves cognitive functions. **Exercise** is one of the most potent stimulus for brain health and Alzheimer's disease prevention and cognitive reserve. The more you exercise, the bigger your brain.

</details>

**主持人**: 刷社交媒体呢？如果我正在看视频，它能提高我的储备吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: What about scrolling on social media? Does it improve my reserve if I'm watching videos?

</details>

**Louisa**: 恰恰相反。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: It's in the opposite.

</details>

**主持人**: 为什么会这样？因为我还在学习东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Why would that be? Cuz I'm still learning stuff.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 当我在互联网上时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: When I'm on the internet.

</details>

**Louisa**: 因为你这样做时，你依赖的是短暂的**多巴胺**刺激。每次你滑动屏幕，你都在向大脑发送信号，表明你正在获得多巴胺刺激。你的大脑会习惯它。记住，你的大脑只为了两件事：生存和繁殖。所以每次你以最小的量刺激大脑时，你都在给它多巴胺刺激，这使得我们无法长时间地做其他事情，比如专注、阅读、交谈。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Because what you're doing then is you are relying on short **dopamine** hits. Every time you scroll, you're sending signals to your brain that you're getting a dopamine hit. And your brain gets used to it. Remember, your brain is only there for two things, survival and reproduction. So every time that you stress your brain in the smallest amount of times, you're giving it dopamine hits, it doesn't allow us to do other things for a sustained period of time like focus, read, have a conversation.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以写作和阅读有助于建立我的神经储备。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So writing and reading are good for building up my neurological reserves.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的，神经储备。它无法与**锻炼**对大脑的作用相比。这很令人难过，因为美国大约80%的人口每周至少锻炼30分钟，这实际上相当可怕。体育活动指南是每周150到300分钟的中度到剧烈体育活动。你遇到过的最令人信服的研究是什么，证明锻炼对预防**阿尔茨海默病**和大脑健康至关重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yeah, neurological reserves. It doesn't compare to what exercise can do for the brain. And it's so sad because around 80% of the US population don't exercise for at least 30 30 minutes a week, which is actually quite scary. The physical activity guidelines are 150 minutes to 300 minutes of moderate to rigorous physical activity per week. What's the most compelling study you've ever encountered that proves that exercise is central to Alzheimer's prevention and brain health?

</details>

### 运动与大脑健康

**Louisa**: 当我们查看所有数据时，我们可以看到最大的投资回报来自**阻力训练**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: When we look at all of the data, we can see that the biggest amount of return on investment is from **resistance training**.

</details>

**主持人**: **阻力训练**是指？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Resistance training being

</details>

**Louisa**: **力量训练**。最令人信服的研究之一可能是**SMART试验**，他们招募了一组患有**轻度认知障碍**的人，让他们每周进行两到三次**阻力训练**，他们不仅保留了**认知功能**，还提高了**处理速度**，增强了**流体智力**，并减缓了**灰质**的萎缩。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: **strength training**. One of the most compelling studies was probably the um the **smart trial** where they uh took a group of people with **mild cognitive impairment** and gave them two to three times per week of resistance training and they not only preserved their cognitive functions. They enhanced their processing speed. They enhanced their **fluid intelligence** and they had slowing of the **gray matter**.

</details>

**主持人**: **灰质**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: The gray matter.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的。你的大脑由**灰质**和**白质**组成。灰质是位于大脑外侧部分的细胞体，而白质则深藏于大脑内部，那里是我们所有**有髓神经元**的所在地。随着时间的推移，我们看到大脑白质中会出现小的病变。所以，很多时候人们会问我：“**Stephen**，我妈妈得了**阿尔茨海默病**，我担心我也会得。”我们之前谈过遗传学。还有一个我们没有谈到的遗传风险因素。**APOE E4基因**是患**阿尔茨海默病**最强的风险因素之一，但这并不意味着你一定会患病。例如，**Chris Hemsworth**接受了检测，他有两个这种基因的拷贝。你得到两个拷贝，一个来自妈妈，一个来自爸爸。它是**载脂蛋白E基因**，有三种主要变体：**APOE E2**、**ApoE3**和**ApoE E4**。我是一个33型携带者，我已经接受了检测，这是普通人群的普遍情况。他们是33型。所以它不会增加我患病的风险，但也不会保护我。如果你有一个**APOE E2基因**的拷贝，它会保护你免受疾病侵害。但如果你有一个**APOE E4基因**的拷贝，它会使你的风险增加两到三倍。如果你有两个该基因的拷贝，它会使你的风险增加10倍。如果你是男性，这里有一个毁灭性的事实：如果你是女性，带有一个该基因的拷贝，你的风险是男性的两倍。所以，女性带有一个**ApoE4基因**拷贝会使你的风险增加大约六倍，而两个拷贝则会使你的风险增加15倍。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yeah. So your brain consists of both **gray and white matter**. So gray matter are the cell bodies that lives on the outer side outer portions of your brain and the white matter is deep within the brain and that's where all of our **myelinated neurons** live and over time we see that we can have little lesions in the white matter of the brain. So, a lot of the times people will ask me, "**Stephen**, I'm scared my mother had Alzheimer's disease. I'm scared I'm going to get it." And we were talking about genetics before. And there's another genetic risk factor that we didn't talk about. The **APOE E4 gene** uh is one of the the strongest risk factors of getting Alzheimer's disease, but it is not a foregone conclusion that you're going to get it. So, **Chris Hemsworth** was tested and he has two copies of this gene. So you get two copies, one from mom, one from dad. It's the **apo lipoprotein E gene** and it comes in three main variants. So you've got **APOE E2**, **ApoE3** and **ApoE E4**. So I'm a 33 carrier. I've been tested and that's the general population. They're 33. So it doesn't raise my risk of getting the disease, but it also doesn't protect me. If you've got a copy of the **APOE E2 gene**, it protects you against the disease. But when you have a copy of the **APOE E4 gene**, it raises your risk by two to three times. If you have two copies of the gene, it raises your risk by 10 times. If you are a male, here's the devastating thing. If you are a female with one copy of the gene, you are at doubled the risk than your male counterpart. So one copy of the gene of **ApoE4 gene** for a female raises your risk by about sixfold whereas two copies raises your risk by 15fold.

They uh did better on different cognitive tests.

**主持人**: 为什么**阻力训练**会增加我的大脑尺寸？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Why is resistance training increasing the size of my brain?

</details>

**Louisa**: **阻力训练**对你的大脑有很多好处。首先，我们必须考虑我们正在进行的旅程，对吗？所以当你查看所有研究时，我想明确一点，所有研究都表明，为了产生阻力训练的神经效应，你需要举起你**一次重复最大重量（1RM）**的80%左右。所以是80%的1RM。这相当重。现在社交媒体上有很多争议。我应该举重还是举轻？当谈到**肌肥大**时，也就是增加肌肉、肌肉质量、肌肉细胞大小，你可以通过举轻重量、高次数来实现，也可以通过举重重量、低次数来实现。这取决于你是谁以及你有多少时间。但具体到大脑，你想举重的原因有几个。第一个原因是当我们举重时，当我们像这样收缩肌肉时，我们正在释放一整套化学物质。它们被称为**肌因子**。当它们从肌肉中释放出来时，它们会进入大脑，对我们的**认知表现**、**认知能力**产生有益的影响，并有助于**海马体**中新神经元的生长和增殖。而这正是**阿尔茨海默病**期间首先受影响的。它实际上会萎缩。海马体储存着我们的记忆。我们很多**记忆巩固**和学习都在这里发生，这就是为什么**短时记忆**是这种疾病期间首先消失的东西。好的？随着我们年龄的增长，我们发现你可以通过结构化和持续的锻炼在海马体中生长新的神经元。最大的生长将由于**BDNF（脑源性神经营养因子）**而发生。所以这是一种大脑的生长因子，它在我们锻炼时释放。当我们进行有氧训练、跑步、长距离骑行时，它会大量释放，但当我们进行阻力训练时也会释放。现在，这里是它的美妙之处。当我们进行阻力训练并释放所有这些肌因子时，这些肌因子是信号分子。它们协同作用。所以我们有一种叫做**鸢尾素**的肌因子。好的？它是一种信使分子。所以它的作用是帮助BDNF表达自身。所以当我们释放这种肌因子时，它会进入大脑，穿过**血脑屏障**，并告诉BDNF表达自身。然后BDNF进入并帮助海马体中生长新的神经元。但我们还有另一种肌因子。我们以**白细胞介素-6**为例。它来自**白细胞介素家族**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: **Resistance training** does so much for your brain. The first thing is we have to think about the journey that we're going on, right? So when you look at all of the studies, I want to make it really clear, all of the studies show that in order to produce the neural effects of resistance training, you need to be lifting at around **80% of your one repetition max**. So 80% of one RM. So that's quite heavy. There is so much controversy on social media right now. Should I lift heavy? Should I lift light? And when it comes to **hypertrophy** alone, so increase in muscle, muscle mass, muscle cell size, you can get there, men can get there, women can get there by lifting light, high reps, or you can get there by lifting heavy and low reps. It just depends on who you are and how much time you have. But when it comes to the brain specifically, you want to be lifting heavy for several reasons. The first one is when we lift heavy, when we literally like when we contract our muscle like this, we are releasing a whole set of chemicals. They're called **myioines**. And when they're released from the muscle, they go up to the brain and they do beneficial things for our **cognitive performance**, our **cognition**, and they help with the growth and proliferation of new neurons in the **hippocampus**. And it's the first thing to go during Alzheimer's disease. it actually shrinks. This holds our memory. This is where a lot of our **memory consolidation** and learning takes place, which is why **short-term memory** is the first thing to go during this disease. Okay? And as we get older and what we found is that you can grow new neurons in the hippocampus from structured exercise and consistent exercise. the biggest growth is going to occur because of **BDNF**, **brain derived neurotropic factor**. So this is a growth factor for the brain and it gets released when we exercise. It gets released abundantly when we are doing aerobic training, when we're running, when we're cycling for long distances, but also gets released when we do resistance training. Now, here's the beautiful thing about it. When we do resist resistance training and we're releasing all of these myioines, these myioines are signaling molecules. They work together. So we've got one called **irri**, okay? And that's a messenger molecule. So what it does is it actually helps BDNF express itself. So when we release this myioin, it goes into the brain, crosses the **bloodb brain barrier** and it tells BDNF to express itself. So then BDNF goes in and it helps grow new neurons in the hippocampus. But then we've got another mioine. Let's just take **isle 6**. **Interlucan 6** that comes from the **interlucan family**.

</details>

**主持人**: 那是什么？抱歉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: What is that? Sorry.

</details>

**Louisa**: **白细胞介素家族**是一类**促炎细胞因子**。所以这些在我们处于压力下，或者你感染了病毒时会释放。但当我们锻炼时，它取决于部位。**白细胞介素-6**不是作为促炎细胞因子，而是作为**抗炎细胞因子**。所以，它进入大脑并降低炎症。事实上，这是第一个被研究的**肌因子**之一，他们表明**白细胞介素-6**也负责下调**肿瘤细胞生长**。所以锻炼也是一种有效的**抗癌干预**，通过肌因子发挥作用。一个人需要做多少运动才能避免癌症相关的副作用，以及**阿尔茨海默病**问题？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: The **interlucan family** is a a class of **pro-inflammatory cytoines**. So these get released when we are under stress or you've got an infection or a virus for example. But when we exercise, it depends on where the site is. **Interlucan 6** instead of acting as a pro-inflammatory cytoine. Instead of creating inflammation, it acts as an **anti-inflammatory cytoine**. So, it goes into the brain and it lowers inflammation. In fact, this is uh one of this was one of the uh first ever myioines to be studied and they showed that **interlucan 6** is also responsible for the down reggulation of **tumor cell growth**. So exercise is a potent **anti-cancer intervention** as well by way of myioines. How much exercise does one need to do to avoid the uh cancer related um side effects but also the Alzheimer's problem?

</details>

**Louisa**: 嗯，每天30分钟的**有氧体育活动**可以下调13种癌症，其中最突出的是**乳腺癌**、**结肠癌**和**前列腺癌**。所以这三种癌症被研究得最多，你可以从**肌因子**的释放中获得抗癌效果。所以，当我们锻炼时，我们会大量释放一种叫做**自然杀伤细胞**的东西。当这些自然杀伤细胞进入血浆和血液中时，它们会进入肿瘤部位，做它们生来就该做的事情：杀死。所以它们会进入肿瘤部位并开始杀死肿瘤，这就是你获得抗癌效果的地方。但你也可以从**阻力训练**的抗炎效果、**有氧训练**的抗炎效果中获得。所以这些肌因子非常强大，事实上，制药公司正在花费数十亿美元试图复制这些肌因子。我希望男性和女性都进行大重量训练，因为你的大脑中有一些区域。就在这里是你的**运动皮层**。把你的大脑想象成房地产。你的大脑中有一部分房地产是为大重量训练保留的。所以每次你举起重物而不是轻物时，举起重物需要更多的神经房地产。所以你举得越重，神经驱动力就越大。神经驱动力越大，对你的大脑就越好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Well, just 30 minutes a day of **aerobic physical activity** can downregulate 13 types of cancers and the most prominent ones being **breast cancer**, **colon cancer** and **prostate cancer**. So these three have been studied most and you get your anti-cancer effects from the **myioine** release. So quite specifically when we exercise we're getting a robust release of something called **natural killer cells**. And when we get these natural killer cells into the plasma and into the bloodstream, they go into the tumor site and they do what they were born to do. They kill. So they go into the tumor site and they start to kill the tumor and this is where you get your anti-cancer effects of it. But you can also get it from the anti-inflammatory effects of resistance training, anti-inflammatory effects of aerobic training. So these myioind powerful in fact pharmaceuticals are spending billions of dollars trying to replicate these myioind. I want both men and women lifting heavy because you've got areas in your brain. Right across here lives your **motor cortex**. Think of your brain as real estate. There's real estate in your brain reserved for lifting heavy. So every time you lift a heavy weight as opposed to a lightweight, it takes more neural real estate to lift that heavy weight. So the heavier you lift, the greater the neural drive. The greater the neural drive, the better it is for your brain.

### 久坐与心血管健康

**主持人**: 根据**世界卫生组织**的数据，我们正变得越来越**久坐不动**。也就是说，我们运动得越来越少，部分原因是技术，但**克利夫兰诊所**也进行了一项非常有趣的研究，他们谈到了**主动久坐**的人。这让我感到有点个人化，说实话。它说2025年的一项主要发现揭示了主动久坐的危险，即那些每天锻炼30到60分钟，但其余10小时都坐着的人。如果你每天坐超过10小时，即使你达到了每周的锻炼目标，你患**心血管疾病**的风险也会增加，因为长时间坐着会关闭**脂蛋白脂肪酶**，这是一种燃烧脂肪和清除血液中葡萄糖的必需酶。读到这个很烦人，因为我觉得那就是我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: According to the **World Health Organization**, we're getting increasingly more **sedentary**. I we're moving less and less in part because of technology, but also there was this really interesting study done by the **Cleveland Clinic** where they talk about people who are **active sedentary**. And this this felt a little bit personal if I'm honest. It says a major finding in 2025 found a danger of being active sedentary, which is people who exercise for like 30 to 60 minutes but sit for the remaining 10 hours a day. If you sit for more than 10 hours a day, your risk of **cardiovascular disease** increases even if you meet weekly exercise goals because prolonged sitting shuts down **lipoprotein lipes**, an enzyme essential for burning fat and cleaning glucose from the blood. That wasn't that's annoying to read because I feel like that's me.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的。而**久坐不动**就是一种疾病。你可以通过每小时做10个**空气深蹲**来改变你的人生轨迹。有一项研究表明，如果你每小时做10个空气深蹲，这可以弥补你的久坐生活方式。因为不幸的是，这就是我们现在的生活。我们的日常生活中变得越来越久坐。我们坐得更多。我们出门的机会更少。有更小的孩子在玩电子游戏。他们在刷手机。有很多事情都涉及到我们的久坐生活方式，这显然，就像你说的，增加了我们患**2型糖尿病**、**心血管疾病**等的风险。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yeah. And being sedentry is a disease. You can change the trajectory of your life by doing **10 air squats** every hour on the hour. And there was a study that was done on this that showed that if you do 10 air squats every hour, this can compensate for your sedentary lifestyle. Because unfortunately, this is the life we're living in. We are becoming more sedentary in our day-to-day lives. We're sitting more. We're not going out as much. There's younger kids uh on video games. They're scrolling. There's so much happening that is involving our sedentary lifestyle, which is obviously, like you said, increasing our risk of **type 2 diabetes**, **cardiovascular disease**, etc.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。你可以这样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Every hour. Just get up or every 45 minutes get up and do an air squat. And this is primarily because have you heard that when you eat you get a massive spike of glucose. And the best way to bring that glucose spike back down is by doing any form of exercise. You can albe it go out and go for a a fast run, do an air squat, bring that uh bring that glucose level back to baseline. And do you think much about aerobic training as a preventative measure for Alzheimer's?

**Louisa**: 我喜欢**有氧训练**。女性在社交媒体上面临困境，因为她们获得了太多信息。关于是否应该进行**Zone 2运动**，存在巨大的争议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: I love aerobic training. Women are facing a dilemma on social media because they're being given so much information. There is this huge uproar of should I do **zone 2 exercise** or should I not do zone 2 exercise?

</details>

**主持人**: 什么是**Zone 2运动**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: What is zone 2 exercise?

</details>

**Louisa**: 我们可以将生理学分为不同的区域。**Zone 1**就是你我现在的状态，对吧？**Zone 2**是下一个级别，通常是我们以最大心率的60%左右进行锻炼，你可以慢跑但可以交谈，但会气喘吁吁。当我们锻炼时，我们需要产生能量，这种能量首先在**线粒体**中产生。所以我们需要所有的能量都被创造出来。我们产生**ATP**，这就是我们能够执行给定任务的方式。一旦我们离开那个区域，进入**Zone 3**、**Zone 4**和**Zone 5**，我们就会在线粒体外，在**细胞质**中产生能量。当我们这样做时，为了做到这一点，我们通过一个叫做**糖酵解**的途径快速分解葡萄糖。其副产品是**乳酸**。然后我们产生乳酸，这实际上是大脑的燃料来源。它也是一种**肌因子**，对吧？所以那是在Zone 3、Zone 4、Zone 5的时候。所以很多女性一直在做Zone 2。她们一直在健身房。她们一直在做Zone 2。我正在尝试推动女性摆脱Zone 2，原因有几个。不是因为它对你不好。我认为所有形式的锻炼都对你有益。你运动得越多越好，对吧？但老实说。很多中年人很忙。他们时间贫乏。男性通过做Zone 2可以获得更大的投资回报。女性通过做Zone 2无法获得相同的投资回报。所以，我正在尝试推动女性首先进行Zone 5、Zone 3、Zone 4、Zone 5。如果她们能做到，就只做Zone 5。然后每周进行两到三次**阻力训练**。如果你还有时间，那就是我刚才描述的大约4小时的锻炼。如果你还有时间，那么你就可以进行Zone 2。现在，Zone 2很棒。如果你要出去长跑，你正在做很多事情。你正在分泌大量的**BDNF**，这是我们需要的。它是一种大脑的生长因子。你正在获得大量的血液流入大脑，这也很好。持续的血液向大脑输送氧气和营养。你正在做很多事情，对吧？但你没有做的是对心脏腔室产生完整的影响。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: So we can think of uh physiology in zones. **Zone one** is what you and I are in right now, right? **Zone two** is that next level up and that's generally when we're looking at exercising at around 60% of our maximum heart rate and it's where you can where you're jogging but you can have a conversation but where you're huffing and puffing. When we're exercising we need to produce energy and that energy firstly starts in the **mitochondria**. So we need uh all of our energy gets created. We create **ATP** and that's how we are able to perform the given task. As soon as we get out of that zone and we go into **zone 3**, **zone 4** and **zone 5**, we're producing energy outside of the mitochondria in the **cytoplasm**. And when we're doing that, in order to do that, we're breaking down glucose so fast via a pathway called **glycolysis**. The byproduct of that is **lactate**. And then we produce lactate and that's actually a fuel source for the brain. It's also a myioine, right? So that's when we're in zone 3, zone 4, zone 5. So a lot of women have been doing zone 2. They've been going to the gym. They've been doing zone 2. And I'm trying to push women to get out of zone 2 for several reasons. Not because it's not good for you. I think all forms of exercise are good for you. The more you move, the better, right? But let's be really honest. A lot of people in midlife are busy. They're time poor. Men actually get a greater return on investment by doing zone 2. Women don't get the same return on investment from doing zone 2. So, I'm trying to push women to first work on zone five, zone 3, zone 4, zone 5. If they can, just do zone five. Then do two to three sessions of resistance training a week. And if you have time left over, that's right there. I've just described around 4 hours of exercise. If you have time left over, then you can work in zone 2. Now, zone 2 is great. If you're going to go out and go for a long run, you're doing many things. You are secretreting a lot of **BDNF**, which we need. It's a growth factor for the brain. You're getting a massive uh amount of blood that's going into the brain which is great as well. It's sustained blood delivers oxygen and nutrients to the brain. You're doing a lot of things, right? But what you're not doing is having a complete effect on the chambers of your heart.

**主持人**: 我在跑步机上跑5公里还是在外面跑更好？我会说，为了大脑健康，你最好做少量但强度更高的运动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Is it better for me to do 5 km on a treadmill or outside? I would say it's better for you for the brain to do a smaller amount of exercise and a higher threshold.

</details>

**Louisa**: 因为我，我想我曾经在哪里读到过，在外面跑步对大脑更好，因为它能刺激大脑。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: because I I was I think I read somewhere one time that running outside is better for the brain because it stimulates the brain.

</details>

**Louisa**: 嗯，你在外面，所以你周围有很多东西。想象你的大脑，我告诉过你它拥有黄金地段。大脑的每个部分都负责不同的功能，从你看到的东西到你听到的东西。你走到外面，可以看到很多东西。你有**向前运动**。所以这会帮助你产生动力、动机、**多巴胺**，但你也会接收到声音、感官。它会下调炎症。所以你从这样做中获得很多其他好处。是的。但是，与20分钟的高强度有氧运动相比，在外面跑5公里，哪一个对大脑更好？我会说Zone 5对大脑更好。**Zone 5训练**对你的心脏腔室也有很多好处。现在，我来拿这个。我们这里有一个小模型，我们可以看到我们有一个左心室。我们有一个右心室，我们实际上有心脏的四个腔室，但心脏中有一个叫做**心室**的东西。我们有一个**左心室**，我们有一个**右心室**。现在，左心室将富氧血液输送到全身。这非常有趣，因为左心室的腔室就像一块肌肉，对吧？它负责将血液泵送到全身。它首先将血液输送到大脑，这意味着它是你身体最重要的部分。在它完成向大脑输送血液后，它会流向身体的其他部分。随着我们年龄的增长，这些动脉会变硬。好的？心脏所有动脉的**硬化**。我们会患上一种叫做**左心室肥大**的疾病。所以当心室，左心室开始变厚时，这意味着我们不能，它不像年轻时那么强壮，不能像年轻时那样泵送那么多血液到身体的其他部分。**Ben Lavine博士**，他是一位运动心脏病专家，他做了一项里程碑式的研究，改变了我对**Zone 5训练**的看法。他招募了一组久坐不动的男性，平均年龄，我想大约是47到55岁，也就是大约50岁，他扫描了他们的心脏。他做了，你知道，他看了，他做了**超声心动图**，他拍了心脏的照片。他尽一切可能去观察他们刚开始协议时，他们的心脏是什么样子。然后他让他们每周进行大约4小时的锻炼。这与他每周进行一次**阻力训练**相结合。其中一次是高强度体育活动，心率达到最大心率的90%左右，即**V2 Max**心率。然后在这之间，他还进行了一些长时间的训练，对吧？但所有这些都是中度到剧烈的运动，持续了两年。在这两年结束时，他发现他将心脏重塑了20年。所以他将与年龄相关的心脏效应和缺陷逆转了20年。本质上，仅仅通过体育活动，将50岁的心脏变成了30岁的心脏。

**Louisa**: of well you're outside so you've got so many things around you. Imagine your brain I told you it's got prime real estate. Every part of the brain is responsible for a different function from what you see to what you hear. You go outside and you can see so many things. You've got **forward ambulation**. So that's going to help you with drive, motivation, dopamine, but then you're also taking in the sounds, the senses. It downregulates inflammation. So you get so many other things from doing that. Yes. But 5 km outside compared to 20 minutes of high aerobic physical activity. What is better for the brain? I would say that the zone 5 is better for the brain. The **zone 5 training** does a lot for the chambers of your heart as well. Now, I'm going to grab this. We've got a little model here, and we can see that we have h a left chamber. We have a right chamber, we have actually four chambers of the heart, but we have something in the heart called a **ventricle**. We've got a **left ventricle**, and we've got a **right ventricle**. Now, the left ventricle delivers oxygenated blood to the entire body. It's really interesting because the chamber of the left ventricle is like a is like a muscle, right? It's responsible for pumping blood to your entire body. It first gives blood to the brain, which means it's the most important part of your body. After it's done giving blood to the brain, it goes through to the rest of the body. As we get older, we get **stiffening of these arteries**. Okay? Stiffening of all of the arteries in the heart. and we get we get something called **left ventricular hypertrophy**. So that's when the ventricle the left ventricle it starts to get thicker and when it gets thicker that means that we can't it's not as strong it can't pump a lot of blood as much as it could when it was younger to the rest of the body. **Ben Lavine**, **Dr. Ben Lavine**, he's a sports cardiologist and he did this landmark study which changed how I thought about zone 5 training. He took a group of sedentary males, average age, I think it was around 47 to 55, so around 50 years old, and he scanned their hearts. He did, you know, he looked at, he did **echo cardiograms**, he took photos of the heart. He did everything he could to see when they was first starting the protocol, what does their heart look like? He then subjected them to around 4 hours of exercise per week. And that was stratified against he did one resistance training session a week. One was highintensity physical activity at around 90% of the maximum heart rate, the **V2 max heart rate**. And then in between he did some long sessions as well, right? But it was all moderate to rigorous exercise and that was done over two years. At the end of those two years, what he found was that he remodeled the heart by 20 years. So he reversed the age related effects and defects of the heart by 20 years. Essentially turning the 50-year-old hearts into 30-year-old hearts just from physical activity alone.

**Louisa**: 所以他让他们做，比如说，其中一个方案是以最大心率的90%进行锻炼。所以当我们这样做时，我们通常会寻求提高我们的**V2 Max**。你可能听说过V2 Max和力量，但V2 Max是**全因死亡率**最强的预测因子，对吧？所以如果你想提高你的V2 Max，如果你想获得他所做的心脏相关改变，你需要做的是每周进行20分钟的V2 Max训练，只是为了保持你的V2 Max，因为它确实会年复一年地下降。从大约35岁开始，我们就会看到V2 Max的下降。所以，如果我们想提高我们的V2 Max，我们想做的是我们称之为**挪威4x4训练法**。它是提高V2 Max的黄金标准。所以，你需要让你的心率升高到90%到95%，持续4分钟，休息4分钟，重复四次。那么，我怎么做呢？我实际上每周做两次，因为做得越多越好。我在**踏步机**上做这个。我在健身房做这个，我把我的踏步机调到，我想我大概在14级，我正在努力提高，我会在上面待4分钟，然后完全停止，完全休息4分钟，然后重复四次。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: So he got them to do like let's say for example one of the um one of the protocols was exercising at 90% of your maximum heart rate. So when we do this, we're generally looking at increasing our **V2 max**. So you've probably heard that V2 max along with strength, but V2 max is the strongest predictor of all cause mortality, right? So if you want to improve your V2 max and if you want to get the heart related changes that he did, what you want to do is you want to do 20 minutes of V2 max per week just to keep your V2 max because it does decline year on and year out. Starting at the age of around 35, we start to see a decline in V2 max. So, if we want to work on our V2 max, we want to be doing a what we call the **Norwegian 4x4**. It's the gold standard of increasing your V2 max. So, you want to get your heart rate elevated to 90 to 95% for 4 minutes on, 4 minutes off, repeat four times. So, how do I do this? Well, I actually do this twice a week because the more you do, the better. I do this on a **stepper**. I do this at the gym and I put my stepper onto I think I'm at like a level 14 and I'm working my way up and I'm staying on there for 4 minutes and then I'm having a complete stop and a complete rest for 4 minutes and I'm repeating that four times.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Mhm.

</details>

**Louisa**: 所以我那时所做的，我不仅让大量的血液涌向大脑。好的，这很好。我不仅让大量的**肌因子**和**外泌体**释放到大脑。我还重塑了心脏。我下调了**肿瘤细胞生长**。我提高了我的**认知表现**。我做的不仅仅是锻炼。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: So what I'm doing in that moment, I'm not just getting a massive shunting of blood to the brain. Okay, which is good. I'm not just getting a massive release of myioines and exocines to the brain. I'm also remodeling the heart. I'm downregulating tumor cell growth. I'm improving my cognitive performance. I'm doing so much more than just exercising alone.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以在**Lavine**的研究中，每周一次就让这些人的心脏年轻了20岁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So that's once once a week in Lavine's study that reversed these guys hearts by 20 years. Y

</details>

**Louisa**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: um

</details>

**主持人**: 你每周做一次。你只需要每周做一次，但他还做了大约每周2小时的70%最大心率的运动。他还加入了一次**阻力训练**。所以**持之以恒**是关键。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: that you do that once a week. you only have to do that once a week, but he also did um he did around 70% of maximum heart rate for around 2 hours a week. And he also threw in one resistance training session. So consistency is key.

</details>

**主持人**: 我正在看那项研究的一些发现，其中一个令人惊讶的地方是，它表明心脏的逆转存在一个生物学上的“保质期”。是的。心脏在65岁之前保持其**可塑性**，即自我重塑的能力。如果干预在65岁之后开始，心脏就太僵硬了，无法通过物理方式重塑以实现20年的逆转。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I'm just looking at some of the findings of that study and one of the surprising things is it showed that there is a biological exploration date per se for the reversal of the heart. Yeah. And then the heart retains its **plasticity**, the ability to remodel itself until the age of 65. If this intervention had started after the age of 65, the heart was too stiff to be physically remodeled to get that 20 year reversal.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 你必须在中老年时期开始。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: You have to start in late middle age.

</details>

**Louisa**: 完全正确。所以**中年**是改善大脑健康和延长寿命的机会之窗。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Exactly. So **midlife** is the window of opportunity for brain health and for longevity.

</details>

**主持人**: 我没想到你可以自己重塑心脏。这很有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I didn't realize you could sort of remodel the heart yourself. That's interesting.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的，你可以重塑心脏。心脏很神奇。好的。因为你看到的**主动脉**，对吧？主动脉向上，我们有，我们有两条，我们有大脑的主要血液供应存在于**椎动脉**中。好的？所以主动脉分支出来自心脏。椎动脉为大脑的后部和小脑供血。然后你有**颈动脉**。所以主动脉两侧各有一条分支，为大脑的额叶和中部供血。大脑是全身血管最丰富的器官。在**高血压**等压力时期，好的，那是血压升高。我们看到我们实际上可以杀死最小的血管部分，它们被称为**毛细血管**。你可以在这里看到毛细血管。它们甚至为**血脑屏障**供血。所以它们主要为大脑的外皮层供血。当我们血压升高时，我们开始杀死大脑中那些微小的毛细血管。这些毛细血管正在滋养大脑中不同的神经元，也滋养血脑屏障。所以当这些毛细血管断裂时，我们就会失去血液供应，失去氧合作用，我们就会出现血脑屏障本身的**破裂**，这很可怕。我们在患有**轻度认知障碍**的患者中看到了这一点。你可以称之为，你听说过**漏肠**，我们可以称之为**漏脑**。如果你有漏脑，最终会发生什么呢？你的血脑屏障是这样的。好的？那里有细胞，我们称它们为**周皮细胞**，它们通过**紧密连接**结合在一起。这就是血脑屏障。你可以把血脑屏障想象成夜总会的保镖。它们都像这样站在那里，负责谁可以进入，谁不可以。它们不允许某些分子进入。但随着时间的推移，当它开始降解并变得渗漏时，它们就会开始分开。当它们分开时，所有这些分子都可以被动扩散进入。这对你的大脑非常有害。所以，我们希望通过维持**毛细血管健康**来维持血脑屏障的完整性。我们不希望毛细血管死亡。它们只有一层细胞厚。任何类型的损伤都可能损伤并杀死它们。**高血压**。有一项非常棒的研究。它被称为**SPRINT试验**，它现在是120/80建议的黄金标准。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yeah, you can remodel the heart. And the heart is amazing. Okay. Because what you see with the **aorta**, right? So the aorta goes up and we've got we've got two we've got uh the main blood supply for the brain exist in the **vertebral arteries**. Okay? So there's branching off of the aorta comes from the heart. Vertebral arteries which supply the posterior part of the brain and the cerebellum with blood. And then you've got the **corroted arteries**. So one on each side branching off the aorta which supply the uh frontal and middle part of your brain with blood. The brain is the most vascular rich organ in the entire body. In times of stress such as **hypertension**, okay, that is elevated blood pressure. We see that we can actually kill off the tiniest parts of the blood vessels which are called the **capillaries**. You can see the capillaries up here. They supply even the **bloodb brain barrier**. So they supply mainly the outer cortex of the brain with blood. When we have elevated blood pressure, we are starting to kill off those tiny little capillaries of the brain. Those capillaries are feeding different neurons in the brain and also feeding the bloodb brain barrier. So when we get breaking off of these, we lose the blood supply, we lose the oxygenation, we get um a **breakdown of the bloodb brain barrier** itself, which is scary. And we see that in patients who have got **mild cognitive impairment**. You can call it, you've heard of **leaky gut**, we can call it **leaky brain**. If you have a leaky brain, what happens eventually is so your bloodb brain barrier sits like this. Okay? And there are cells and we call them **parasites** for example and they're bound together by **tight junctions**. That's what the bloodb brain barrier is. It's like a you think of the bloodb brain barrier as the bouncer of a nightclub. They are all standing there like this responsible for who can come in and who can't. and they don't allow some molecules to get in. But over time, when this starts to degrade and become leaky, they start to spread apart. And when they do, you can have the passive diffusion of all these molecules coming in. And that's really bad for your brain. So, we want to maintain the integrity of the bloodb brain barrier by maintaining the **capillary health**. We don't want the capillaries to die. They're one cell thick. Any type of damage can damage them and kill them. hypertension. There was a really great study. It was called it was actually the **sprint trial** and it was it's now the gold standard for the recommendation of 120 over 80. What's

</details>

**主持人**: 那是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: that?

</details>

**Louisa**: 所以当你测量血压时，我们得到**收缩压**和**舒张压**。你可能，我不知道你是否每天测量血压，但每天测量血压是维持良好大脑健康的一个非常棒、廉价且有效的工具。所以你测量你的血压，如果你有**高血压**，也就是任何超过135的收缩压，那就是问题开始出现的时候，那时我们的小而薄的**毛细血管**开始破裂。所以在这项试验中，在**SPRINT试验**中，他们发现当他们积极管理这些患者并降低他们的血压时，他们通过一种叫做**ACE抑制剂**的药物进行药理学干预。这是一种降血压的药物。当他们通过药理学方法降低血压时，这些患者保留了他们的大脑**灰质**和**认知功能**。所以我们现在有了一个黄金标准。这就是我向亚马逊上的任何人推荐的。一个自动血压计大约25美元。每天早上测量一次，并监测你的血压。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: So when you have your blood pressure taken, we get the **systolic** over **diastolic**. And you've probably I don't know if you take your blood pressure, but doing your blood pressure every day is a really great inexpensive and effective tool for maintaining good brain health. So you measure your blood pressure and if you are **hypertensive** this is anywhere over 135 okay systolic over 135 that's when things start to break down that's when we start to get the breakdown of those small one cell thick capillaries. So in this trial, in the **spring trial**, what they found was that when they aggressively manage these patients and they bring their blood pressure down, they did it pharmacologically through something called an **ACE inhibitor**. It's a medication to drive down blood pressure. When they bring it down pharmacologically, these patients preserved their brain gray matter and their cognitive functions. So we now have a gold standard. And this is what I would recommend anybody on Amazon. And it costs about $25 for a blood an **automatic blood pressure monitor**. Do it every single morning and watch your blood pressure.

</details>

**主持人**: 如果血压高，我该怎么办？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And then if it's high, what do I do about it?

</details>

**Louisa**: 嗯，除了药理学之外，如果我们不想服用药物，我们想变得更强壮。我们想通过**锻炼**来实现这一点。**压力**是导致高血压的最大因素之一。通过锻炼、睡眠以及大自然赋予我们的一切来管理压力、管理**皮质醇**、管理**慢性炎症**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Well, outside of pharmarmacology, if we don't want to take a medication, we want to get stronger. And we want to do this via exercise. **Stress** is one of the biggest things driving high blood pressure. manage stress, manage **cortisol**, manage **chronic inflammation** by way of exercise, sleep, all of the things that mother nature gave us.

</details>

**主持人**: 我刚才正在看那项让心脏年轻20年的研究，并试图弄清楚他们做了哪些运动。正如你所说，第一个是高强度训练，**4x4训练法**。然后他们做了一次长时间的**有氧运动**。同样，这都是每周一次。所以每周一次60分钟的长时间运动，比如徒步、网球或骑自行车。一次中等强度的训练，30分钟，他们做了**谈话测试**，你应该能出汗但仍能说话。所以那也是每周一次。最后，每周一次**力量训练**。所以这真的是多种多样的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I was just looking at the um the study that reversed the heart by 20 years and trying to figure out what exercises they did. And as you said, the first one was a highintensity workout, the **4x4**. Um then they did a long aerobic exercise. Again, this is all once a week. So 60 minutes once a week doing a longer exercise like it could be hiking or tennis or cycling. a moderate intensity workout, 30 minutes where they did the **talk test**, you should be able to break a sweat but still be able to speak. So that was once a week. And then lastly, strength training once a week. So it's really a variety.

</details>

**Louisa**: 运动对心脏产生了如此深远的影响。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: of exercises that caused such a profound impact on the heart.

</details>

**主持人**: 我认为**心血管疾病**是最大的单一杀手。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And I think cardiovascular diseases are the single biggest killer.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的。**心血管疾病**，**痴呆症**是英国女性的第一大杀手。第一大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yeah. **Cardiovascular disease**, **dementia** is the number one killer of women in the UK. The number one.

</details>

**主持人**: 真的吗？它是澳大利亚男性和女性的第一大死因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: really. It's the number one cause of death in Australia for both men and women.

</details>

**主持人**: 它是如何杀死你的？因为我们都想到**记忆丧失**之类的，但是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: How does it kill you? Because we all think about memory loss and stuff like that, but

</details>

**Louisa**: 这就是真正毁灭性的部分。我们并非死于**阿尔茨海默病**本身。随着时间的推移，这些患者会发生什么呢？你必须记住，阿尔茨海默病就像晚期癌症。一旦你得到诊断，就没有治愈方法。没有回头路。没有逆转。你患有这种疾病，这是最可怕的部分。**轻度认知障碍**，你可以减缓其进展。就像我告诉你的，它会持续20年。轻度认知障碍，你可以减缓轻度认知障碍的进展，但一旦你在那个可怕的日子被诊断出患有阿尔茨海默病，你的母亲或你的朋友被诊断出患有阿尔茨海默病，那是一个悲伤的日子。这些患者最终会发生什么呢？你可能会死于**窒息**。你可能会死于，你的大脑失去**吞咽**的信号。它失去信号，也许你会因为失去平衡而跌倒。这确实是一个非常可怕的时刻，但你并非死于阿尔茨海默病本身。如果你被诊断出患有阿尔茨海默病，这是一个有趣的反应。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: and so this is the actual devastating part. We don't die of **Alzheimer's disease** specifically. Over time, what happens is in these patients, you have to remember Alzheimer's disease is like endstage cancer. Once you get the diagnosis, there is no cure. There is no going back. There is no reversal. you have the disease and that's the scariest part. **Mild cognitive impairment**, you can slow the progression of that. Like I said to you, it goes for 20 years. Mild cognitive impairment, you can slow the progression of mild cognitive impairment, but as soon as you get diagnosed on that awful day that your mother or your friend gets diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, it's a sad day. And what ends up happening with these patients is you can die of **esphyxiation**. You can die of you. Your brain loses the signal to **swallow**. It loses the signal to maybe you fall because you've lost balance. It's really it's a really scary moment, but it's not like you die of Alzheimer's disease specifically. If you were diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, it's an interesting reaction.

</details>

**主持人**: 因为我将没有希望。我认为一个更好的问题是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Because I would have no hope. I think a a better question is.

</details>

**Louisa**: 你将没有希望。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: you'd have no hope.

</details>

**主持人**: 如果我被诊断出患有**阿尔茨海默病**，我将无能为力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: If I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, there is nothing I could do.

</details>

**Louisa**: 这会如何改变你的生活和你做出的决定？或者会改变吗？我会积极地、积极地锻炼。我会监测我的饮食。我会积极地监测我的饮食，我可能会采用**生酮饮食**，因为我们发现，在你的大脑中发生的这种**代谢危机**期间，好的？你失去了将葡萄糖作为主要燃料来源的能力。所以大脑不知道如何将葡萄糖作为其主要燃料来源。所以它受到了攻击。在**阿尔茨海默病**期间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: How would that change your life and the decisions you make? Or would it at all? I would aggressively aggressively exercise. I would monitor my diet. I would aggressively monitor my diet and I would potentially have a **ketogenic diet** because what we've found is that during this **metabolic crisis** that happens in your brain, okay? Where you lose the ability to use glucose as your primary fuel source. So the brain doesn't know how to use glucose as its primary fuel source. So it's under attack. during Alzheimer's.

</details>

**主持人**: 在**阿尔茨海默病**期间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: during Alzheimer's.

</details>

**Louisa**: 但也在这个窗口期，对于女性来说，也在**围绝经期**。所以当脑细胞受到攻击，无法有效利用葡萄糖，并且没有能量时，它就会开始思考生存。它开始思考我能做什么？我受到了攻击。所以它开始分解**髓鞘**。在那一刻，实际上是**星形胶质细胞**，它们是大脑细胞的支持者。所以它们开始思考，好吧，让我们分解髓鞘，从那里，星形胶质细胞产生**酮体**，然后酮体被输送到大脑，这就是我们大脑利用能量的方式。所以，在那种代谢危机状态下，我会确保我正在进行富含酮体的饮食，或者我可能会摄入**外源性酮体**。我会积极锻炼。我会积极管理我的血脂。我会大量摄入**Omega-3脂肪酸**，如果可能的话，我会通过与人交谈、外出、社交、进行艰难对话来保留任何形式的认知功能，如果我身体健全并且能够这样做的话。我会把网球扔到墙上。所以关于生酮饮食这一点，原因是酮体是葡萄糖的替代燃料来源。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: but also during this window in of for women as well in the **pmenopause state**. So the brain cell when it's under attack and it can't utilize glucose effectively and it doesn't have any energy it starts to think about survival. It starts to think what can I do? I'm under attack. So it starts to break down the **myelin sheath**. And in that moment it's actually the **aststerittes** they're the supporters of the brain so of the brain cells. So they start to think okay let's break down the myelin sheath from that the **astroytes** produce **ketone bodies** and then the ketone bodies get shuttled into the brain and that's how we use uh energy in the brain. So in that state of metabolic crisis I would make sure that I am having a **ketone rich diet** or I may be getting **exogenous ketones**. I would aggressively exercise. I would aggressively manage my my lipids. I'd have a high intake of **omega-3 fatty acids** and I would preserve if I could any form of cognitive function by way of talking to people by going outside, socializing, having hard conversations if I was intact and I could do so. I would throw tennis balls to the wall. So on that point of the ketogenic diet, the reason is because ketones are an alternative fuel source to glucose.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Y

</details>

**主持人**: 大脑喜欢**酮体**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: and the brain likes ketones.

</details>

**Louisa**: 大脑喜欢**酮体**，它实际上比葡萄糖更有效地利用酮体。但葡萄糖是大脑的主要燃料来源。这里有一个非常有趣且毁灭性的事情，如果你愿意的话，对于女性来说，在**围绝经期**开始时，对吗？当我们看到**雌激素**下降时，对吗？我们看到雌激素下降，会发生什么呢？大脑葡萄糖代谢会减少30%。所以，当这些受体开始死亡时，因为我们没有，我们血液中不再有大量的雌激素循环，会发生什么呢？嗯，我们无法有效利用葡萄糖。所以在那种状态下，我们开始分解**髓鞘**，将其作为**酮体**，作为替代的大脑燃料来源。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: The brain loves ketones and it actually utilizes them more effectively than glucose. But glucose is the primary fuel source for the brain. And here's what's really interesting uh and devastating if you will for females during the onset of **pmenopause**, right? when we see a decline in **estrogen**, right? We see a decline in estrogen, what happens is a **30% reduction in brain glucose metabolism**. So, when these receptors start to die because we don't have uh we don't have a lot of estrogen circulating in the bloodstream anymore, what happens? Well, we can't utilize glucose as effectively. So during that state, that's when we start to get the breakdown of the myelin sheath to use that as uh as ketone bodies as an alternative brain fuel source.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么你认为经历更年期的女性应该考虑**生酮饮食**吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So do you think women going through menopause should be considering a ketogenic diet?

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的，我确实这么认为。我认为经历**围绝经期**并处于这种**大脑能量危机**中的女性，如果可能的话，应该采用**生酮饮食**。它是大脑最好的饮食之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yes, I do think that I think that women who are going through pmenopause and who are at the mercy of this brain energetic crisis should be adopting if they can a ketogenic diet. It's one of the best diets for the brain.

</details>

**主持人**: 我真的不明白这个想法，即在更年期期间，大脑存在**葡萄糖缺乏症**或**代谢问题**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I didn't really understand this idea that during menopause there was a glucose deficiency or metabolism problem in the brain.

</details>

**Louisa**: 大脑葡萄糖代谢减少30%。这就是为什么女性报告有**脑雾**和各种类似问题的原因吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: **30% reduction in brain glucose metabolism**. Is this why women report to having **brain fog** and all these kinds of things?

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的，绝对是。因为当大脑无法有效利用其燃料来源时，会发生什么呢？嗯，代谢物开始转移。我们睡不好。大约60%到65%的更年期女性报告有**潮热**或**盗汗**。这让她们夜间醒来。这也会导致**认知能力下降**和**脑雾**。所以，我的意思是，这张图表相当令人震惊。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yeah, absolutely. Because when the brain can't utilize its fuel source effectively, what happens? Well, metabolites start to shift. We don't sleep properly. Around 60 to 65% of women in menopause report having a **hot flash** or **night sweats**. It wakes them up at night. That's also causing cognitive decline and brain fog. So, I mean, this graph is pretty shocking.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，你能解释一下它显示了什么吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Um, can you explain what it shows?

</details>

**Louisa**: 哦，这显示了从出生到女性经历的所有生命周期，**青春期**、**围绝经期**，然后最终是**更年期**的**雌激素水平**。有一件事是肯定的。在年龄之后，我之前提到过，作为女性是患上这种疾病的下一个最强的风险因素。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Oh, this is showing the um **estrogen levels** at birth going through all of the life cycles that a woman will go through, **puberty**, **pmenopause**, and then eventually **menopause**.

### 激素替代疗法与阿尔茨海默病

**Louisa**: 这就是争议所在。是也不是。所以我想让每个人都明白，我现在坐在这里。我的整个博士论文都专注于女性和**阿尔茨海默病**，而我现在在**激素替代疗法**方面是“瑞士”。也就是说，目前没有证据表明，我们没有大规模的随机对照试验来证明激素替代疗法可以预防**痴呆症**。所以我要告诉你的是：它是一个信号。它是一个支持者。它会帮助你做那些可以降低你患痴呆症风险的事情。我们多次看到，进行激素替代疗法可以将你患**阿尔茨海默病**的风险降低高达30%。我们知道这一点。但这并非因为**雌激素**本身降低了你的风险。而是因为当你拥有雌激素时，它有助于消除**潮热**。它有助于缓解**盗汗**，因为在更年期，当我们大脑中的雌激素调节失衡时，**下丘脑**会发生什么呢？下丘脑是大脑中控制我们体温调节的区域，当我们女性失去监测体温的能力时，会发生什么呢？当她感到一丝热意时，她的体温，你知道，会略微升高。下丘脑不知道该怎么办。所以它发出信号，我非常热。所以它会使你的体温急剧升高，那就是**潮热**。然后它会迅速降低。结果，这让女性夜不能寐。我们知道**睡眠不足**是**阿尔茨海默病**的一个风险因素。当然是。累积的睡眠不足会在你的大脑中积累**淀粉样β蛋白**。所以如果我们能替代，如果我们能使用**激素替代疗法**作为信号和支持来帮助我们夜间入睡，那么这是一件好事。另一件事是，雌激素对肌肉具有**合成代谢作用**。

So what I will tell you is this. It is a signal. It is a supporter. It will help you do the things that can lower your risk of dementia. We've seen multiple times that having hormone replacement therapy can reduce your risk of getting **Alzheimer's disease** by up to 30%. We know that. But it's not because **estrogen** alone is minimizing your risk. It's because when you have estrogen, it helps get rid of the **hot flashes**. It helps with the **night sweats** because during menopause when we actually have a disregulation of the of estrogen in our brain, what happens in the **hypothalamus** which is an area in the brain that controls our temperature regulation when we lose the ability to monitor our temperature for a woman. What will happen is when she feels the slightest bit hot, her temperature, you know, is rising a little bit. The hypothalamus doesn't know what to do. So, it signals, I'm super hot. So, it'll raise your temperature right up, and that's a hot flash. And then it'll bring it right down. And as a result, this is keeping women up at night. And we know that **sleep deprivation** is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Of course, it is. compounding sleep deprivation will accumulate **amaloid beta** in your brain. So if we can replace if we can use hormone replacement therapy as a signal and as a support to help us sleep at night then that's a good thing. Another thing estrogen is **anabolic to muscle**.

</details>

**主持人**: 那是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: What does that mean?

</details>

**Louisa**: 这意味着它有助于**肌肉蛋白质合成**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: It means that it helps with **muscle protein synthesis**.

</details>

**主持人**: 哦，它帮助我制造肌肉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Oh it helps me make muscle.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的。我们的骨骼上有**雌激素受体**。我们的肌肉上也有雌激素受体。所以如果**雌激素**对肌肉有合成代谢作用，如果雌激素有助于肌肉蛋白质合成，如果雌激素有助于**骨矿物质密度**，那么在更年期补充雌激素将有助于我们应对所有**阿尔茨海默病**的风险因素。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yeah. We've got **estrogen receptors** on our bone. We've got estrogen receptors on our muscle. So if estrogen is anabolic to muscle, if estrogen helps with muscle protein synthesis, if estrogen helps with **bone mineral density**, then replacing estrogen during that menopause state is going to help us with all of the risk factors of Alzheimer's disease.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么**雌激素**什么时候，我的意思是，在这张图中它真的急剧下降。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So when does estrogen I mean it really in this image drops off a cliff.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的。而且它因人而异。所以它通常平均发生在45岁左右，那个**围绝经期**阶段持续大约10年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: and Yeah. And it varies. So it tends to generally happen at around 45 years old as an average and that that pmenopause stage lasts around 10 years.

</details>

**主持人**: 但它在这张图上大约30岁时就开始下降了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: but it starts going down on this graph at about 30.

</details>

**Louisa**: 它开始下降，每个人都不同。好的，你可能有一个30多岁末的女性进入**围绝经期**，或者普遍年龄在42到45岁左右。我交谈过的大多数妇产科医生都说，你需要在40岁左右开始定期检查，以检查这个问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: It starts to go down and everyone's different. Okay, you can have a woman in her late 30s go into pmenopause or the general age is around 42 to 45. Most OBGYNS that I've spoken to say that you need to start checking in with your doctor at around 40 years old to check for this.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么，你现在在想我的未婚妻，你认为像她这样的人应该在40岁左右开始**激素替代疗法**吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So, do you thinking about my fiance now, do you think that someone like her should go on hormone replacement therapy at like 40?

</details>

**Louisa**: 嗯，所以这是一个大问题。这是一个房间里的大象。你是否应该进行**激素替代疗法**？这绝对是你和你的医生之间的对话。然而，我们现在有大规模的研究表明，我们不必害怕激素替代疗法。而且，不深入细节，有一项大规模研究，**妇女健康倡议**，它吓得女性不敢服用激素替代疗法，因为害怕。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Well, so that's the that's the big question. That's the elephant in the room. Should you go on hormone replacement therapy or should you not? And that's definitely a conversation between you and your physician. However, we've got largecale studies right now to show that we don't have to be afraid of hormone replacement therapy. And without going too deep into the weeds, there was a massive study that was done, the women women's health initiative, that scared women out of taking hormone replacement therapy in fear.

</details>

**主持人**: 患**乳腺癌**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: of getting breast cancer.

</details>

**Louisa**: 对。我们从40%的女性服用**激素替代疗法**下降到只有4%的女性服用激素替代疗法。我们知道，即使在更年期开始时，女性患**心脏相关事件**的风险也会增加三倍。女性患**阿尔茨海默病**的风险也会增加。所以这里有一些关于激素替代疗法益处的主张，我们还没有研究过。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Correct. We went from having 40% of women on hormone replacement therapy to just 4% of women on hormone replacement therapy. We know that even at the onset of menopause, a woman's risk of having a **heart related event** triples. A woman's risk of getting Alzheimer's disease increases. So there is something to posit here about the benefits of hormone replacement therapy that we still haven't yet studied.

</details>

**主持人**: 你会进行**激素替代疗法**吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Will you do hormone replacement therapy?

</details>

**Louisa**: 我肯定会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: I definitely will.

</details>

**主持人**: 哪种激素？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And what kind of hormone?

</details>

**Louisa**: 看，这真的很有趣。这是我朋友给我的，这是胶囊。所以这是**雌二醇**和**孕酮**。好的，所以孕酮是那种能帮助你夜间入睡的。这个是**阴道雌激素**。所以，这是一种乳膏，实际上，你知道，根据情况，它可以被插入，而且阴道雌激素，如果你把它涂在脸上，它可能是你能拥有的最好的护肤品。是的，我们的所有组织，包括皮肤，都有**雌激素受体**。这些是**雌二醇**插入剂。所以，那不是乳膏本身，但如果你得到乳膏形式的阴道雌激素，你可以把它涂在脸上，它有助于**皮肤弹性**、**胶原蛋白**、**真皮厚度**。这就是我最兴奋的原因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: And look, so this is really interesting. So um this was given to me by a friend and there's this is the um this is the capsule. So this is **estradile** and **progesterone**. Okay, so progesterone is that one that's going to help you sleep at night. This one here is **vaginal estrogen**. So, this is a cream that actually gets uh you know, depending on how it is, it can get inserted and the vaginal estrogen apparently if you put it on your face is probably the best form of skin care that you could ever have. Yeah, we have estrogen receptors all over our tissues, including our skin. These are **estradiol inserts**. So, that's not the cream itself, but if you get vaginal estrogen in the form of a cream, you can put it on your face and it can help with **skin elasticity**, **collagen**, uh **dermal thickness**. This is why I'm actually most excited about it.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以，我的意思是，这些是进行激素治疗的唯一方式吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So, I mean, is this are these the only ways that one can do hormone?

</details>

**Louisa**: 不，还有一种**贴片**，那是大多数女性选择的。**透皮贴片**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: No, there's also um a **patch**, and that's what most women are opting in for. The **transmal patch**.

</details>

**主持人**: 时机成熟时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: when the time comes.

</details>

**Louisa**: 嗯，我可能会使用贴片。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Uh I will probably do the the the patch.

</details>

**主持人**: 为什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Why?

</details>

**Louisa**: 因为它最简单。那是我研究最多的。嗯，我一点也不害怕**激素替代疗法**。你确实需要，你知道，每个人都必须咨询他们的医生，但我绝对认为这将是帮助解决正在发生的**阿尔茨海默病危机**的一件事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: because it's the the easiest. That's the one that um I've researched the most. Uh I'm not afraid of hormone replacement therapy in the slightest. You do have to, you know, everyone has to check with their doctor, but I definitely think that this is going to be one thing that is going to help with the Alzheimer's disease crisis that is occurring.

</details>

**主持人**: 请继续。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Go ahead.

### 阿尔茨海默病的生物学机制

**Louisa**: 我之前提到了**斑块**，对吧？所以很多人会问，是什么将**阿尔茨海默病**与其他**痴呆症**区分开来？这归结为两种蛋白质：**淀粉样β蛋白**和**Tau蛋白**。这里就变得非常有趣了，实际上可以追溯到1901年，第一位阿尔茨海默病患者**Augusta**，她52岁。她和她的丈夫去医院，抱怨**找词困难**、**词语流畅性**差，她记不起把钥匙放在哪里了，她丈夫说她**神志不清**。Augusta告诉船上的医生，他是一位精神病医生，名叫**Eloise Alzheimer**。她对他说，我引用她的话：“我不再知道我是谁了。”正如我所说，这种疾病会剥夺你的自我。1906年，Augusta去世了，她是第一位被记录患有**阿尔茨海默病**的患者。所以尸检时，他们切开她的大脑，发现她的大脑中有这些斑块，他们当时并不真正了解那是什么，但那是这种疾病在社会上首次被发现。从那时起，我们仍在努力解决这种疾病。在2000年代，我们有一种观点，认为阿尔茨海默病是**淀粉样蛋白级联假说**。意思是，患阿尔茨海默病意味着你的大脑充满了**淀粉样蛋白**，这种有毒蛋白质会积聚。所以我们当时将这种蛋白质妖魔化。我们妖魔化了这种在大脑中积聚的**肽蛋白**。然后就出现了药物，好的？以静脉注射药物的形式。所以你去医院，接受静脉注射，承诺它会清除淀粉样蛋白。太好了，我们有治愈方法了。但他们发现，当他们清除这些大脑中的淀粉样蛋白时，他们也带走了**脑组织**，并导致了**微出血**。在一些患者中，这导致了死亡。所以我们现在知道，这里的问题不是淀粉样蛋白。事实上，淀粉样蛋白是一种**抗菌肽**。所以，淀粉样蛋白实际上是件好事。**淀粉样β蛋白**是件好事，因为它保护脑细胞。现在，这是会发生什么。我们在深度睡眠期间有一个美妙的过程。我们激活了**胶淋巴系统**。好的？所以胶淋巴系统来自“胶质细胞”这个词。我们大脑中有**胶质细胞**。它们位于神经元外部，负责免疫。它们是我们的主要免疫反应细胞。在深度睡眠期间，它们会收缩，当它们收缩时，所有漂浮在**脑脊液**中的淀粉样β蛋白都会被冲洗掉。所以这就像你的大脑中发生了一次洗涤。对吗？但**阿尔茨海默病**患者通常会发生什么呢？他们没有机会冲洗掉淀粉样蛋白。在**围绝经期**和**更年期**，由于**潮热**，你无法进入深度睡眠，因为你的睡眠是片段化的，因为你因潮热和盗汗而醒来。所以这就是导致淀粉样蛋白积聚的原因。现在请听我说。我们还有另一种蛋白质，它是**阿尔茨海默病**的标志。它是**Tau蛋白**，Tau蛋白存在于细胞的**轴突**中。我说的那个被**髓鞘**覆盖的轴突，在压力时期会发生什么呢？会发生的是这种Tau蛋白会**磷酸化**。所以它会断裂，基本上Tau蛋白会稳定**微管**。好的，想象一下轴突中的这些铁路轨道，好的？它们只是沿着轴突上下移动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: I mentioned earlier **plaques**, right? So a lot of people ask well what distinguishes **Alzheimer's disease** from the rest of the dementias and it comes down to two proteins **amaloid beta** and **tow protein** and here's where it gets really interesting and actually dates back to 1901 the first ever Alzheimer's disease patient **Augusta** she was 52 years old and she went to the hospital her and her husband went complaining of difficulties of **word finding** **word fluency** and she couldn't remember where she put her keys and her husband said she is **delirious** and Augusta told the doctor on board he was a psychiatrist his name was **Eloise Alzheimer** she said to him and I quote I don't know who I am anymore as I mentioned this disease robs you of who you are in 1906 066 August busted died and that was the first ever patient to be recorded of having Alzheimer's disease and so postmortem they cut her brain open and they found that she had these plaques in her brain and they didn't really know they didn't really understand what it was but that was the first ever induction of this disease in society and ever since then ever since then we are still trying to tackle this disease in the 2000s We had this notion that Alzheimer's disease was the **amaloid cascade hypothesis**. Meaning that great Alzheimer's disease means when you get a head full of amaloid, this toxic protein that builds up. So we were demonizing this protein. We were demonizing this **peptide protein** that builds up in the head. And so then came the medications, okay? In the form of IV drugs. So you go to the hospital, you get an IV in the promise that it will clear out amaloid. Great, we've got a cure. But what they found was that when they were taking out the amaloid in these brains, they were taking with them **brain tissue** and causing **microhemorrhages**. And in some patients, it was resulting in death. So we now know that the problem here isn't amaloid. In fact, amalloid is a **antimicrobial peptide**. So, amaloid is actually a good thing. **Amalloid beta** is a good thing because it protects the brain cells. Now, here's what happens. We have this beautiful process during sleep that occurs when we get into deep sleep. We activate the **glimpmphatic system**. Okay? So, the glimpmphatic system comes from the word gals. Gal cells. We have **gleal cells** in the brain. They sit outside of the neurons and this is what uh is responsible for immunity. They're our chief um immune response cell. During deep sleep they shrink and when they shrink all of this amaloid beta that's floating around in the **cerebral spinal fluid** gets washed out. So it's like a washing machine that occurs in your brain. Right? But what tends to happen in Alzheimer's patients is they don't get a chance to wash out the amaloid. What happens in pmenopause and menopause due to the hot flashes, you don't get to get into deep sleep because you're having a fragmented sleep because you're waking up due to hot flashes and night sweats. So that is what's do that is what's causing the buildup of amaloid. Now stick with me. We've got another protein that is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. It's **towel protein** and towel lives in the **axon** of the cell. The one that I said is covered in the **myelin sheath** and what happens under times of stress. What happens is this tow protein **phosphorolates**. So it breaks off and basically tow protein stabilizes the **microtubules**. Okay, imagine these railro road tracks in the axon, okay? Just going up and down the axon.

</details>

**主持人**: **轴突**是在细胞里还是在大脑里？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: The axon's in the in the cell or in the brain.

</details>

**Louisa**: 所以脑细胞本身，神经元是神经元细胞体，而**轴突**就像树干。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: And so the the the brain cell itself, the neuron is the neuron cell body and the axon is like the trunk of the tree.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Okay.

</details>

**Louisa**: 对。所以支撑树的是**微管**，这些微管由**Tau蛋白**结合。Tau蛋白保持微管的完整性。所以树干是稳定的，它就坐在那里。为什么它需要稳定？因为那是思维速度传播的方式。信息处理速度在那里传播。当**Tau蛋白**磷酸化时，它开始形成**缠结**。它们被称为**神经原纤维缠结**。所以这发生在轴突中。当所有这些缠结聚集在一起时，我们就会看到这个轴突的崩溃，这些微管的崩溃。所以我们不仅在大脑的**脑脊液**中和大脑内部、细胞外部发生环境灾难的级联反应。我们还在细胞体内部发生这种级联反应。所以大脑在细胞内部和细胞外部都受到了攻击。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Right. So holding up the tree are **microtubules** and those microtubules are bound by **tow proteins**. The the tow proteins keep the microtubules intact. So the trunk of the tree is stabilized and it sits there. Why does it need to be stabilized? Because that's how speed of thought travels. Information processing speed travels up there. When the **tow protein** phosphorolates, it starts to form **tangles**. They're called **neuroiary tangles**. So that happens in the axon. And when all these tangles clump together, we get the collapse of this axon, the collapse of these microtubules. So we're not just having a cascade of environmental disaster inside the cerebral spinal fluid of the brain and inside the brain, outside the cells. We've also got this cascade happening inside the cell body itself. So the brain is under attack inside the cell and outside the cell.

</details>

**主持人**: 为什么？到底为什么？为什么会发生这种情况？因为我们对待大脑的方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Why? Why exactly? Why? Why does this happen? Because of how we treat our brains.

</details>

**Louisa**: 因为我们对待大脑的方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Because of how we treat our brains.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的。你的大脑**过度磷酸化**以及这些**Tau蛋白**过度磷酸化，原因有很多。其中之一是，我们一次又一次地看到，我们大脑细胞本身，在轴突中，有**雌激素受体**。所以当我们没有足够的雌激素时，雌激素实际上非常聪明，它正在阻断一种负责磷酸化Tau蛋白的酶。所以如果我们没有雌激素在那里，那么这种酶就会磷酸化Tau蛋白并将其分解，导致这些**神经原纤维缠结**。但假设你是一个男人，你不需要**睾酮**，你不需要雌激素在那里。尽管睾酮具有**神经保护作用**。睾酮实际上会芳香化为雌激素，这就是为什么你实际上在生活中拥有额外的保护。嗯，还有什么导致这种情况？嗯，**压力**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yes. The reason why your brain is **hyperphosphorilated** and the reason why these **tower proteins** are hyperphosphorilated is because of many things. One is we have seen time and time again that we have **estrogen receptors** that are on in the brain cell themselves in the axon. So when we don't have adequate estrogen, estrogen actually is so smart what it is doing, it's blocking an enzyme that is responsible for phosphorolating the towel. So if we don't have the estrogen there, then the towel, the enzyme is there to phosphorolate the towel and break it down and cause these **neuropiary tangles**. But let's just say you're a man and you don't have you don't need the testo you don't need the estrogen there. Although **testosterone** is **neuroprotective**. Testosterone actually aromatizes into estrogen which is why you actually have an extra added protection in your life. Um what else causes this? Well **stress**.

</details>

**主持人**: 你在那里谈到了睡眠。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: You're talking about sleep there.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的。所以**睡眠**，我认为，是迄今为止我们拥有的最被低估的**阿尔茨海默病预防工具**。它被低估了，因为我们一生都在做这件事，我们认为我们只要睡觉，奇迹就会发生。但我认为现在在2026年，我们实际上需要为睡眠进行训练。所以在**深度睡眠**期间，我们激活**胶淋巴系统**，可悲的是，我们大部分人都没有进入深度睡眠。所以睡眠是原因之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yeah. So **sleep** is, I think, by far the most underrated Alzheimer's disease prevention tool that we have. It's underrated because we have been doing it all our lives and we think that we can just go to sleep and the magic happens. But I think now in 2026, we actually need to train for sleep. So during **deep sleep** we activate the **glimpmphatic system** and sadly a large proportion of us aren't getting into deep sleep. So sleep is uh one of the reasons.

</details>

**主持人**: 你怎么睡觉？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: How do you sleep?

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的，我睡觉，我确保每晚睡7个半小时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yeah, I sleep I make sure I sleep 7 and 1/2 hours a night.

</details>

### 睡眠与大脑清洁

**主持人**: 很多人都与睡眠作斗争，他们只是习惯了。我从我的朋友那里听到，他们会说，你知道，我睡不好。我睡5个小时。他们只是习惯了。你认为这没关系吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: A lot of people struggle with sleep and um they've just kind of gotten used to it. I hear this from friends of mine that will say, you know, I'm a bad sleeper. I'll sleep for 5 hours. And they kind of have just gotten used to it. Do you think that's okay?

</details>

**Louisa**: 不。他们将在60多岁和70多岁时为此付出代价。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: No. And they will pay for this in their 60s and 70s.

</details>

**主持人**: 你怎么知道？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: How do you know?

</details>

**Louisa**: 因为我知道仅仅一晚的**睡眠不足**就会使你患**淀粉样β蛋白**的风险增加至少4%到5%。仅仅一晚。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Because I know that just one night of **sleep deprivation** is raising your risk of **amaloid beta** by at least 4 to 5%. just one night.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以你可以想象这种积累。不仅如此，我们知道你正在干扰负责饥饿和饱腹感的激素。我们知道睡眠不足会增加你患**2型糖尿病**的风险。但不仅如此，我们还看到这种复合效应无法逆转。这意味着很多人认为，我每晚睡6小时，然后在周末补回来。但遗憾的是，我们的大脑并非如此运作。它不像我们可以偿还给银行的债务。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So you can imagine the accumulation of this. Not only that, we know that you're interrupting with the hormones that are responsible for hunger and society. We know for hunger and satiety. We know that you're increasing your risk of type 2 diabetes with um sleep deprivation. But not just that, we also see that this compound effect can't be reversed. Meaning that a lot of people think, I'll just sleep for 6 hours a night and then just bank on it on the weekend. But sadly, that's not how our brain works. It's not like debt that we can repay to the bank.

</details>

**主持人**: 我前几天听**Matthew Walker**说，我们可以把它存起来。他说，你无法弥补失去的睡眠。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I heard from **Matthew Walker** the other day though that we can save it up. He said um he said you can't make up for lost sleep.

</details>

**Louisa**: 完全正确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Exactly.

</details>

**主持人**: 但是如果周一我知道我会被剥夺睡眠。他说在周末，比如周六和周日，如果我睡了很长时间，那就像。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: But if on Monday I've got something where I know I'm going to be deprived. He says on the weekends like Saturday and Sunday, if I got a huge amount of sleep, it's kind of like.

</details>

**Louisa**: 我可以用那个。是的，那就像。是的，那就像储备。是的，我实际上会这样做。我坐长途航班。从洛杉矶到纽约大约6小时，但也到澳大利亚。所以如果我知道我要坐长途航班，我会在航班前大约一周储存我的睡眠，因为我知道我会在飞机上**睡眠不足**。所以，如果你是那些与睡眠作斗争的人，现在正在听，并且他们有点担心，你知道，你谈到了这个**胶淋巴系统**，它在夜间出来清洁大脑。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: I can use that. Yeah, it's kind of like Yeah, it's kind of like the reserve. Yeah, actually I do this. I do long haul flights. I'll be it like 6 hours between LA and New York, but also to Australia. And so if I know I'm going on a long haul flight, I'll bank on my sleep for about a week leading up to that cuz I know I'm going to be sleepd deprived on the plane. So, if you were one of those people that struggles with sleep, that's listening right now and they're slightly concerned that, you know, you talked about this um **glimpmphatic system** which sort of comes out at night and cleans up the brain.

</details>

**主持人**: 他们听到，你知道，如果我睡不好，我的**胶淋巴系统**就不会处于最佳状态。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: and they're hearing, you know, my glimpy system isn't going to be optimal if I'm not sleeping.

</details>

**Louisa**: 如果那是你，无论出于何种原因，你开始睡不好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: If that was you, and for whatever reason, you start sleeping poorly.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Mhm.

</details>

**主持人**: 你会怎么做？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: What would you do about it?

</details>

**Louisa**: 我会非常认真地审视我前一天的生活方式。所以，这通常涉及两件事。你必须问自己，你是难以入睡还是难以保持睡眠？很多女性报告说难以入睡，这意味着她们思绪万千。男性也是如此，他们思绪万千。他们无法，你知道，停止那种**默认模式网络**和那些奔腾的思绪。这是一件事。然后是无法保持睡眠，这意味着我因为热而醒来。我因为压力大而做噩梦而醒来。你醒来的原因有很多。所以对于那些夜间难以入睡的人，我强烈建议引入一种叫做**GABA（γ-氨基丁酸）**的补充剂。它是我们主要的**抑制性神经递质**。当你服用它时，它真的有助于稳定所有这些思绪。它有助于平息思绪，并能帮助你在夜间平静下来。我接下来会做的是思考我吃什么。实际上，事实证明，吃**淀粉类蔬菜**，比如**红薯**，它会带来更好的益处，在夜间补充碳水化合物有助于你入睡。如果你开始为睡眠进行训练，就像睡眠是你的马拉松一样，并在晚上8点开始为此做准备，放下，你知道，不要发邮件，不要进行任何艰难的对话，不要在夜间看任何疯狂的东西，你会让你的思绪平静下来，你会让你的神经系统平静下来。但我认为大部分优化发生在你真正睡觉的时候。我还会努力进行**睡眠调节**。所以，我们知道，为了入睡和保持睡眠，我们的**核心体温**需要下降至少2度。我正在使用**温度控制床垫**来做到这一点，因为它正在进行**热调节**。很多人没有这种床垫，可以做几件事，比如把脚放在被子外面睡觉，或者打开空调，打开恒温器来冷却房间，以降低你的体温，核心体温。你可以补充的一种东西是**甘氨酸**，我认为它很棒，因为它通过**温度调节**来帮助睡眠。它可以降低你的核心体温。事实上，我对此机制了解不多，但甘氨酸本身具有改善寿命的最大**长寿益处**之一。所以服用甘氨酸也可以帮助这一点。现在，对于那些难以保持睡眠的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: I would get really serious about examining my lifestyle the day before. So, this generally involves two things. You have to ask yourself, are you having trouble falling asleep or are you having trouble staying asleep? A lot of women report trouble falling asleep, meaning they've got a **racing mind**. Men, too, they've got this racing mind. They can't, you know, just stop that **default mode network** and the the racing thoughts that happen. That's one thing. And then there's the I can't stay asleep meaning that uh I'm waking up due to heat. I'm waking up because uh I'm stressed and I'm having bad dreams. There's all different reasons as to why you wake up. So for the person who is having trouble falling asleep at night, I would strongly recommend introducing a supplement called **GABA**, which is **gamma aminoic acid**. It's our chief **inhibitory neurotransmitter**. And when you have this, it really helps stabilize all those thoughts. It helps with erasing mind and it can help calm you down at night. The next thing I'll do is I will think about what I'm eating. Actually, it turns out that um eating **starchy vegetables**, something that's going to make you like, you know, **sweet potatoes** for example, it's going to have a better benefit uh backloading uh your carbs at night for helping you sleep. If you start training for sleep as if sleep is your marathon and start preparing for that at 8:00 p.m. at night, getting off, you know, don't email, don't have any hard conversations, don't watch anything crazy at night, you'll settle your mind down, you'll settle your nervous system down, but where I think uh most of the optimization occurs is when you're actually in sleep. I would also work on um **sleep regulation**. So, what we know is that in order to fall asleep and stay asleep, our **core body temperature** needs to drop at least 2°. And I'm doing this with a **temperature controlled mattress** cuz it's working on **thermal regulation**. A lot of people who don't have that can do uh several things like sleeping with their feet outside of the sheets or turn turning the the air conditioning on, the thermostat on to cooling the room, to cooling down your body temperature, core body temperature. One thing that um you can supplement with is **glycine**, which I think is amazing because it helps with sleep by way of temperature regulation. It can bring down your core body temperature. And in fact, and I don't know too much about the mechanism behind this, glycine itself has one of the greatest **longevity benefits** for improving lifespan. So, taking glycine can also help with that. Now, in terms of the person who is having trouble staying asleep,

**主持人**: 这个呢？你没提到**南非醉茄**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: what about this one? You don't talk about the um the old ashwagandha.

</details>

**Louisa**: 哦，是的。**南非醉茄**很棒。好的。南非醉茄会帮助你缓解**压力**。你这里有**南非醉茄**和**红景天**。所以它们都是**适应原**。基本上，适应原很棒，因为它会进入你的身体并适应你身体正在发生的事情。所以假设你的**皮质醇**升高了。这通常发生在白天不同的周期，主要是在我们醒来的白天，皮质醇水平达到峰值，但也可能发生在夜间。服用这个实际上可以稳定皮质醇，因为它可以进入并与皮质醇结合并降低它。如果某个东西没有升高而是很低，它也可以升高它。所以它真的很好。它是一种适应原，研究表明你可以每天服用三次，你不会感到疲劳。它不会干扰任何事情，而且它与**咖啡因**搭配得很好，例如。**茶氨酸**也是如此。所以，这实际上是一个非常棒的补充剂。你真的谈到了你需要为入睡做准备或放松。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Oh, yeah. **Ashwagandha** is great. Okay. Ashwagandha is going to help you with **stress**. And you've got here **Ashwagandha rodeiola**. So, what they both are, they are **adaptogens**. And basically an adaptogen is great because it it goes in and it adapts to what is happening in your body. So let's just say you have elevated **cortisol**. And this tends to happen you know during different cycles during the day mainly during the uh daytime when we wake up where cortisol levels are at its peak but it can also happen at night. Having this can actually stabilize that cortisol because it can go in and combine to cortisol and bring it down. likely if something is not elevated and it's low, it can bring it up. So, it's really good. It's an adaptogen and studies show that you can actually take this three times a day and you won't feel fatigued. It doesn't disrupt anything and it pairs really well with **caffeine**, for example. So does **theineine**. So, this is actually a really great um adjunct to your supplement stack. And you really talk about how you need to sort of warm up to warm down or warm up to go to sleep.

</details>

**主持人**: 哦，是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Oh, yeah.

</details>

**Louisa**: 从晚上7点左右开始。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Starting at like 7:00 p.m.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的。从晚上8点左右开始。这与**昼夜节律**和**昼夜生物学**一致。当谈到睡眠和你的昼夜节律时，你有点想模仿太阳和大自然。太阳什么时候开始下山？它大约在晚上8点左右开始下山，这取决于你在世界的哪个地方。当这种情况发生时，我们也会自然释放**褪黑素**。所以褪黑素是那种在黑暗中释放的**睡意激素**。这可能也是导致某人难以入睡和保持睡眠的另一个原因。所以我们希望自然释放它。所以，现在发生的这些生物黑客，戴着我们的**红光**面罩睡觉，调暗灯光。看，调暗灯光很棒。嗯，我实际上已经把家里卧室里所有的灯泡都换成了红光灯泡。所以，我正在消除**蓝光**，那些垃圾光。我用红光代替它，以帮助下调神经系统。是的，我确实戴着**蓝光阻挡眼镜**，或者说眼镜。我是否认为它们提供了即时而巨大的益处？我不知道。但它们可能有一些小的益处。所以放松包括做这些有助于你下调神经系统的事情，这样你就能更快入睡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yeah. Starting at like 8:00 p.m. And that's in line with **circadian rhythm** and **circadian biology**. You want to try and when it comes to sleep and your circadian rhythm, you kind of want to mimic the sun and mother nature. And when does the sun start to go down? It starts to go down at around 8:00 p.m. depending on where you are in the world. And when this happens, we also get the natural release of I love that you're taking that, by the way. You must be stressed right now. You get the natural release of **melatonin**. So melatonin is that sleepy hormone that gets released in response to darkness. This may also be another reason why somebody somebody is having trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. So we want to get the natural release of that. So, these bio hacks that occur right now, sleeping with our **red light** mask on, dimming the lights. Look, dimming the lights is great. Um, I've actually replaced all of my light bulbs um at home with in my bedroom as well with red light bulbs. So, I'm getting um I'm getting rid of the **blue light**, the junk light. I'm replacing it with red light to help down regulate the nervous system. Yes, I do wear **blue light blocking goggles** or glasses, I should say. Do I think that they're providing an immediate and huge benefit? I don't know. But they could have a minor benefit there. So warming down involves doing these things that are going to help you downregulate your nervous system so you can fall asleep faster.

### 补充剂的作用

**主持人**: 接着谈谈补充剂。**Omega-3**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Sticking on supplements for a second. Omega-3.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yes.

</details>

**主持人**: 我这里有一些**Omega-3**。我有两瓶。嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Um I've got some omega-3 here. I've got two of them here. Mhm.

</details>

**Louisa**: 但当我把它们都拿出来时，你说我必须非常小心我买的品牌，还有一些关于温度的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: But when I brought both of them out, you said that I've got to be quite careful about what brand I buy, but also something about temperature.

</details>

**Louisa**: 所以，在所有补充剂中，**Omega-3**可能是唯一一个你必须确保查看补充剂标签的。有一项研究表明，美国大约95%最受欢迎的Omega-3补充剂，其中大约85种经过测试，超过了正常的**氧化水平**，这意味着这些药丸，因为它们是**Omega-3脂肪酸**，它们来自**鱼油**，它们是油，它们会变质和氧化。它们通常在受热环境中会发生这种情况。以下是经验法则。第一，你要寻找一个高度可信且经过**NSF认证**的制造商。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: So, by far out of all of the supplements, **omega3** is probably the only one that you have to make sure that you look at the supplement label for there. There was this study that was done that showed that around 95% of the most popular omega-3 supplements in the US, and there was about 85 of them that were tested, exceeded the normal **oxidation level**, meaning that these pills, because they're **omega-3 fatty acids**, they come from **fish oil**, they are oil, they can become rancid and oxidized. And they usually do this when they're in a heated environment. Here are the here are the rules of thumbs. One, you want to look for a manufacturer that is highly credible and that is certified.

</details>

**主持人**: 认证。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Certified.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的。所以是**NSF认证**。所以它是一个外部管理委员会，对它们进行认证，你知道，所有重金属。他们确保符合氧化水平，他们确保，你知道，胶囊里的东西确实在胶囊里。这是另一个可怕的事情。补充剂行业高度 unregulated。我对待我的**Omega-3**就像对待我的**橄榄油**一样。你想要在你所在地区采购的油。我们现在在加利福尼亚。所以，你可能想找一个在加利福尼亚采购的Omega-3。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yeah. So **NSF certified**. So it's an external governing uh board that certifies them on, you know, everything heavy metals. They make sure that the um oxidation levels are met and they make sure that, you know, what's in the capsule is actually in the capsule. That's another thing that is scary. The supplement industry is highly unregulated. And I treat my **omega-3s** the same way I treat my **olive oil**. You want to get oil that is sourced in the area that you are. We're in California right now. So, you might want to find an omega-3 that is sourced in California.

</details>

**主持人**: 我要把它放冰箱里吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Do I want to put it in the fridge?

</details>

**Louisa**: 你一拿到它就想把它放冰箱里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: You want to put it in the fridge the moment that you get it.

</details>

**主持人**: 真的吗？是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Really? Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 为什么没人谈论这个？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Why does nobody talk about that?

</details>

**Louisa**: 我不确定。但是，嗯，就像橄榄油一样。你不希望橄榄油变质，所以你不要把它放在炉子旁边。你想把它放在远离炉子的橱柜里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: I'm not sure. But, um, it's just the same as olive oil. You don't want the olive oil to become rancid, so you don't leave it near the near the stove. You want to put it in a cupboard away from the stove.

</details>

**主持人**: 这些对大脑有好处。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And these are good for the brain.

</details>

**Louisa**: 哦，**Omega-3**是迄今为止你对大脑最有效的刺激之一。它们有助于**细胞膜流动性**。所以，当你的细胞与神经元相遇时，它们会形成一个叫做**突触**的东西。为了发生这种情况，我们有大量的**神经递质**涌入，**多巴胺**、**血清素**。我们还有**钙**和**钾**。这些有助于我们的脑细胞进行交流。好的？我们希望确保我们的膜，细胞膜是流动的，并且它们能够滑动，以帮助**突触传递**。它们做的另一件事是，它们与**非甾体抗炎药（NSAID）**，一种**抗炎药物**相当。这些具有巨大的**抗炎作用**。事实上，我认为这些具有**FDA批准药物**的安全特性，而且只有益处。没有副作用。不仅如此，我们大脑的60%是由**脂肪**组成的。其中70%是由**DHA**组成的。而DHA来自**Omega-3脂肪酸**。所以为什么我不想用我的大脑或大脑中的脂肪来替代它是由什么组成的呢？这就是你服用Omega-3脂肪酸时所做的。事实上，已经有几项试验表明，Omega-3脂肪酸对**轻度认知障碍**患者、患有**APOE4基因**的人以及患有**阿尔茨海默病**的人最有益和最有效，因为当我告诉你我们的**血脑屏障**会破裂时，血脑屏障上的那些**周皮细胞**需要DHA。事实上，我们大脑外部有一个**转运体**，允许DHA进入大脑。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Oh, **omega-3** is by far uh one of the most potent stimulus that you could have for the brain. They help with **cell membrane fluidity**. So, where your cells meet neuron to neuron, they create something called a **syninnapse**. And in order for that to occur, we have a massive influx of all of these **neurotransmitters**, **dopamine**, **serotonin**. We've also got **calcium** and **potassium**. And these help our brain cells communicate. Okay? We want to make sure that our membranes, the cell membranes are fluid and they glide in order to help with that **synaptic transmission**. Another thing that they do is they are comparable to an **NSAID**, an **anti-inflammatory medication**. These have massive **anti-inflammatory effects**. In fact, I think that these have the safety profile of an **FDA approved drug** and there's only benefits from it. There's no side effects from it. Uh not just that 60% of our brain is made of **fat**. 70% of that is made of **DHA**. And DHA comes from **omega-3 fatty acids**. So why do I not want to replace my brain or the fat in my brain with what it's made of? And that's what you do when you have omega-3 fatty acids. In fact, there's been several trials um to show that omega-3 fatty acids are most beneficial and most effective for **mild cognitive impairment** patients, people who have the **APOE4 gene** and people who have got Alzheimer's disease because when I told you that our we get the breakdown of the bloodb brain barrier, those parasites on the bloodb brain barrier require DHA. In fact, there's a transporter on the outside of our brain that allows the um that allows the DHA to come in and get into the brain.

</details>

**主持人**: 我知道你也是**维生素D**的忠实粉丝，因为那里有一些非常令人鼓舞的研究。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And I know you're a big fan of vitamin D as well because there's been some very encouraging studies done there.

</details>

**Louisa**: **维生素D**非常棒。我们的大脑、脑干上都有**维生素D受体**，它们在**海马体**和我们大脑的**记忆中心**大量存在。中国对**百岁老人**进行了一项研究。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: **Vitamin D** is phenomenal. We have **vitamin D receptors** all over our brain brain stem and and they're abundantly found in the **hippocampus** and the **memory centers** of our brain. And there was this act there was actually a study done on **centinarians** in China.

</details>

**主持人**: **百岁老人**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Centinarians?

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的。那些活到100岁的人，但这项研究是在女性身上进行的。他们表明，那些保留了**认知功能**且没有患**阿尔茨海默病**的女性，体内**维生素D**水平很高。所以她们没有维生素D缺乏症。事实上，维生素D缺乏症会使你患**全因痴呆症**的风险增加40%。拥有高水平的维生素D，大约每分升60纳克，可以将你患**阿尔茨海默病**的风险降低大约80%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yeah. Those who lived to 100, but it was done in women. And they showed that the women who preserved their **cognitive functions** and who didn't get Alzheimer's disease had high levels of **vitamin D**. So they weren't vitamin D deficient. In fact, being vitamin D deficient can increase your risk of **all cause dementia** by 40%. likely being having a high level of vitamin D which is around 60 nanogs per deciliter can lower your risk of getting Alzheimer's disease by around 80%.

</details>

**主持人**: 然后我们面前有这种白色粉末。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And then we have this white powder in front of me.

</details>

**Louisa**: 你脸上带着大大的笑容。是的，因为这有很多好处。当然，这取决于你购买的品牌，但我对**肌酸**赞不绝口。我让我的父母服用肌酸。他们71岁了。我让我的父亲服用高剂量肌酸。我让我的母亲服用低剂量肌酸。它是市场上研究最广泛的补充剂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: You've got a big smile on your face. I do because there is just so much benefit to this. Depending on which brand you've bought, of course, but I can't say enough about **creatine**. I have my parents on creatine. They're 71 years old. I've got my dad on highdose creatine. I've got my mother on lowdose creatine. It's the most widely studied supplement on the market.

</details>

**主持人**: 我从未见过你如此兴奋。我太兴奋了，因为我认为这是一种非常便宜有效的方式，可以让你从生理和神经生理学上获得你想要的一切升级。所以，我们来谈谈**肌酸**，因为我知道它经常被提及，但女性和男性仍然害怕它。他们害怕它有两个原因。第一，他们害怕它会导致**肾脏损伤**。第二，他们害怕他们的头发会掉。我将解决这两个担忧。但首先，我们来谈谈它是什么。所以，肌酸是一种天然存在的分子。我们每天产生大约2到3克肌酸。它少量由大脑分泌，但大部分由肝脏分泌。每天2到3克很好，但不够。所以我们必须补充它。在90年代和2000年代，人们每天补充5克。就是这一勺。每天5克肌酸。现在我们对大脑健康研究越来越严格，我们发现肌酸对大脑有巨大的益处。但问题是。当你服用5克肌酸时，你正在使肌肉饱和。好的，记住肌肉非常饥饿，所以它们首先获得优先权，并吸收所有肌酸。所以大脑就没有了。当肌酸进入大脑时，我们也会失去一些**生物利用度**。它穿过**血脑屏障**，但当它进入大脑时，我们会失去一些。所以我们必须补充超过5克。去年改变我思维的一项研究是第一项针对**阿尔茨海默病**患者进行的试点研究。你谈论的是大脑受到攻击的患者。他们处于**能量危机**中。他们无法有效产生能量。**ATP**完全失衡。**大脑葡萄糖代谢**失衡。他们分不清左右。**认知功能**下降。他们让他们每天服用20克肌酸。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I've never seen you this excited. I'm so excited because I think that this is a really cheap and effective way to get everything you want from both your physiology, an upgrade on your physiology and your neurohysiology. So, let's actually talk about **creatine** because I know it gets a lot of air time, but women and men are still scared of it. And they're scared of it for two reasons. One, they're scared it's going to cause **kidney damage**. And two, it's they're scared their hair is going to fall out. And I'm going to address both of those fears. But first, let's talk about what it is. So, creatine is a naturally occurring molecule. We it's we get we produce around 2 to three grams of creatine per day. Gets secreted from a bit from the brain, but a lot from the liver. And 2 to three grams a day is great, but it's not enough. So, we have to supplement with it. And all through the 90s and all through the 2000s, people were supplementing with five grams a day. That is this scoop here. 5 g of creatine per day. Now that we're getting more uh rigorous with our brain health studies, we have found that creatine has enormous benefits for the brain. But here's the problem. When you have 5 g of creatine, you're saturating the muscles. Okay, remember the muscles are so hungry, so they get first dibs and they take up all of that creatine. So then there's none left for the brain. We also lose a bit of the **bioavailability** when the creatine goes into the brain. It crosses the **bloodb brain barrier**, but when it goes into the brain, we lose some of it. So, we have to supplement with more than 5 g. And one of the studies that changed my thinking came out last year. It was the first ever pilot study done on **Alzheimer's disease** patients. You're talking about patients whose brains are under attack. They're in an **energetic crisis**. They cannot produce energy effectively. **ATP** is all skewed. **Brain glucose metabolism** is skewed. They don't remember left from right. **Cognitive functions** are declined. They put them on at **20 g of creatine per day**,

</details>

**主持人**: 那是多少？我的意思是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: which is how much? I mean.

</details>

**Louisa**: 嗯，实际上那是这个的四倍。所以你想要一勺，我不知道他们是否一次性服用。那是两勺。或者他们是否像我一样，在一天中分四次服用。好了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: that well actually that is four of this. So you want to go one and I don't know if they did this all at once. That's two. Or if they did it like me over four separate intervals throughout the day. There we go.

</details>

**主持人**: 那很多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: That's a lot of.

</details>

**Louisa**: 那很多。这就是为什么你可能想把它分散在一天中服用，我就是这么做的。我今天服用了20克。我早上服用了5克，上午中段5克，然后我想我在来这里之前一次性服用了10克。所以一次性服用这么多。他们发现这些患者不仅保留了**认知功能**，而且精力更充沛，能够进行更多的锻炼。这让我大吃一惊，无论你多大年纪都无关紧要。它不分性别。**肌酸**不分年龄。它不分体重。它不分病理或疾病状态或种族。它就在那里。它在那里支持你。它是市场上研究最广泛的补充剂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: That's a lot. Which is why you probably want to have this skewed throughout the day, which is what I did. I had 20 grams today. I had five grams in the morning, five midm morning, and then I think I had 10 all at once before I got here. So that is a lot for all at once. And what they found was that these patients not only preserved their **cognitive functions**, but they had more energy and they were able to exercise more. And it blew my mind that it does not matter how old you are. It doesn't discriminate based on gender. **Creatine** doesn't discriminate based on age. It doesn't discriminate based on weight. It doesn't discriminate based on pathology or disease states or ethnicity. It is just there. It is there to support you. It's the most widely studied supplement on the market.

</details>

**主持人**: 而且它全是风险。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And it's all risk.

</details>

**Louisa**: 它全是回报。没有风险。它有助于**细胞能量代谢**。所以基本上，它有助于**ATP**产生能量。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: It's all reward. There is no risk. It's helping with **cell energy metabolism**. So basically, it's helping **ATP** create energy.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以如果你是一个精力不足的人，你绝对应该服用**肌酸**。我不在乎你是谁，你绝对应该服用肌酸。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So if you're someone that is low energy, you should definitely be having creatine. I don't care who you are, you should definitely be having creatine.

</details>

**主持人**: 有**脑雾**的人和。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: People with brain fog and.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的，有**脑雾**的人，你知道，我认为最大的益处之一是足球运动员。它实际上是一种保护性分子。所以，研究表明，高剂量的**肌酸**，大约每天30克，可以保护你免受伤害。伤害是指你头部受到撞击，比如**脑震荡**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: yeah, people with **brain fog**, you know, I think one of the greatest benefits are men who are in football, football players, you can actually, it's actually a protective molecule. So, what studies has shown is that at high doses of **creatine**, around 30 grams a day, it can protect you against insults. insults meaning you take a hit to the head like a **concussion**.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: H

</details>

**Louisa**: 它可以保护你的大脑免受**脑震荡**。它可以保护你的大脑免受**中风**。它可以保护你的大脑免受**压力**。关于**肌酸**最好的一点是，它在压力的背景下发挥作用。我认为那才是你获得最大益处的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: it can protect your brain against a **concussion**. It can protect your g brain against a **stroke**. It can protect your brain from **stress**. The best thing about creatine is that it works in the background of stress. I think that's where most that's where you'll get most of the benefits from.

</details>

**主持人**: 在这个播客上听了这么多关于**肌酸**的知识后，我开始向我生活中的所有人推荐它。实际上有一个特别的人，她现在可能在我家里，她经历了**癌症治疗**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: After hearing so much about creatine on this podcast, I started recommending it to all of the people in my life. There's one particular person actually that's probably out out there in my house at the moment who had gone through uh cancer treatments.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 她从**癌症治疗**中幸存下来，用她的话说，治疗后她不再是以前的自己了。我跟她谈了**肌酸**，她前几天对我说，我想原话是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And had survived cancer treatments and in their words wasn't the same on the other side of the cancer treatments. And I talked to her about um creatine and she said to me the other day she I think the exact quote was.

</details>

**Louisa**: 我感觉我的生活回来了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: I feel like I've got my life back.

</details>

**主持人**: 因为她过去5个月左右每天都在服用**肌酸**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: because it's she's been taking creatine every single day for the last I'd say 5 months or so.

</details>

**Louisa**: 你说得很有趣，因为就在最近两周，这项研究表明**肌酸**具有**抗癌作用**。如果我没记错的话，他们以每公斤体重0.36克的剂量进行给药。所以如果你是一个70公斤的人，如果我的数学计算正确，你每天大约需要25克肌酸才能产生抗癌效果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: It's funny you said that because just recently in the last two weeks uh this study was done to show the **anti-cancer effects of creatine**. And if my memory serves clear, they uh they dosed it at uh they dosed it at 0.36 g per kilogram of body weight. So if you are a 70 kilo person, if my mathematics is correct, you're looking at around 25 g of creatine per day that can have the effects, the anti-cancer effects.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以你提到的这项研究，我也会在屏幕上展示给任何想看的人。它是**NANS 2025研究**，这是一项涉及超过25000名成年人的大型研究，发现膳食**肌酸**与**癌症患病率**之间存在线性负相关。膳食肌酸摄入量每增加一个标准差，患癌症的风险就会降低大约5%到18%，具体取决于人群。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So the the study you're referring to, I'll put up on the screen as well for anyone that wants to see it. It's um the **NANS 2025 study**, which is a major study involving over 25,000 adults, found a linear negative association between dietary creatine and cancer prevalence. For every standard deviation increase in dietary creatine intake, the risk of having cancer decreased by roughly 5% to 18% depending on the demographic.

</details>

**Louisa**: 那太疯狂了。这种保护性关联在50岁以上的成年人中最为显著，这表明随着年龄的增长，维持较高的**肌酸**水平对于**细胞健康**和**免疫监测**可能更为关键。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: That is wild. This protective association was strongest in adults over the age of 50, suggesting that as we age, maintaining higher creatine levels might be more critical for **cellular health** and **immune surveillance**.

</details>

**Louisa**: 嗯，如果你思考生命和能量，嗯，我们需要能量才能生存。我们需要能量才能抵抗感染。我们需要能量才能抵抗压力，保持我们正常的身体功能。所以当我们处于**低能量危机**时，我们无法抵抗**肿瘤细胞**，我们无法抵抗这些**衰弱性疾病**。所以，更多的能量和更具功能的能量，意味着如果我们的细胞能更好地运作，那么癌症发病率的降低以及**阿尔茨海默病**发病率的降低是合理的。当我提到**肌酸**在压力的背景下发挥作用时。此外，还有一些出色的研究表明，你基本上可以通过服用肌酸来摆脱**睡眠不足**。如果你度过了一个漫长的夜晚，你睡眠不足，也许你睡了四、五、六个小时，你睡眠不足，你可以服用高剂量肌酸，大约每天15到20克，你可以逆转与睡眠不足相关的负面影响。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Well, if you think about life and think about energy, um we need energy to survive. We need energy to fight off infections. We need energy to fight off stress, preserve our normal normal bodily functions. So when we are at the mercy of a **low energy crisis**, we can't fight off **tumor cells**, we we can't fight off these uh debilitating diseases. So it actually makes sense that with more energy and with more functional energy, meaning like if our cells can function better, it makes sense that you can see a reduction in cancer incidents likely you can see a reduction in Alzheimer's disease incidents. when I said that creatine works in the background of stress. Also, there was uh there's been phenomenal research to show that you can basically creatine your way out of **sleep deprivation**. If you've had a uh if you've had a a long night and you you're sleep deprived, maybe you slept four, five, 6 hours, you're sleepd deprived, you can take uh you can take highdose creatine in the form of around 15 to 20 grams a day and you can reverse the negative effects associated with that sleep deprivation.

</details>

**主持人**: 服用**肌酸**的时间有关系吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Does it matter what time you take the creatine?

</details>

**Louisa**: 服用**肌酸**的时间无关紧要。它不会在热水中降解。你可以在一天中的任何时间服用，而且无论你是在锻炼前、锻炼中还是锻炼后服用都无关紧要，它的效果都非常出色。一些研究人员现在正在思考，如果睡前服用它是否有助于改善睡眠表现，我认为这是一个非常令人兴奋的领域。但我想告诉大家的一件事是，很多人害怕这种叫做**肌酐**的生物标志物。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: It doesn't matter what time you take the **creatine**. It doesn't degrade in hot water. it uh you can take it any time throughout the day and it doesn't matter whether you're taking it right before exercise, during exercise, after exercise, it works phenomenally. Some people uh researchers are now uh wondering if taking it at night before bed helps with sleep performance and I think that that's a really exciting area. But the one thing that I want to tell everybody because a lot of people are scared of this biioarker called **creatinine** meaning that.

</details>

**主持人**: 哦，我的医生对我说了那个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: oh my doctor said that to me.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的。所以这意味着你的**肌酐**水平很高。这是一个**肾功能**的标志物。但这就是我发现它真正宝贵的地方。这也是Instagram和社交媒体上很多废话的来源。很多人说：“嗯，我服用了太多肌酸，我的医生告诉我停用它，因为我的肌酐水平很高。”但肌酐水平在压力时期、剧烈体育活动时期会很高。而且肌肉量大的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yeah. So meaning that you've got a a high **creatinine** level. And this is a marker of it's one marker of **kidney function**. But this is where I find it uh really invaluable. And this is where a lot of the nonsense comes around on Instagram and social media. A lot of people say, "Well, I had so much creatine that my doctor told me to get off it because my creatinine levels were high." But creatinine levels are high during times of stress, during times of intense physical activity. Uh, and also people who have a lot of muscle mass,

</details>

**主持人**: 肌肉量越高，你的肌酐水平就越高。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: higher muscle mass, that's you have higher creatinine levels.

</details>

**Louisa**: 肌肉量越高，你的**肌酐**水平就越高。你想要测试一个更好的**肾功能**和**GFR**指标是**胱抑素C**。所以你只需要问，这真的很容易。问你的医生，我能请你在我的血液检查中加入**胱抑素C**吗？如果它升高且不在正常范围内，那么也许可以停用**肌酸**。但现在，我看不出有任何理由不每天服用肌酸。我认为每个人，无论你多大年纪，每个人都应该补充肌酸。现在，最近有一项关于**更年期女性**的研究。这是一项非常小的研究。这是一项随机对照试验，他们将女性分为四组，这些是**围绝经期女性**。他们将她们分为低剂量肌酸组，我想她们每天服用750毫克，中剂量组每天服用大约1.5克。然后他们让她们补充一系列**肌酸单水合物**和**肌酸盐酸盐**。这是一项肌酸盐酸盐研究。然后还有一个安慰剂组。他们发现，这是一项非常小的研究，非常小的群体。他们发现，中剂量组服用1.5克的女性，情绪和**认知功能**有显著改善。所以肌酸现在正在女性的整个生命周期中进行探索，因为它与围绝经期、怀孕、更年期和**痴呆症**有关。所以它就是，它就是，它太棒了。我只想指出一件事，当谈到**肌酸**时，在制造标准方面，你想要关注两件事。第一，它是否经过**NSF认证**？第二，你想要寻找它是否是**Creapure**？那是肌酸的黄金标准，它来自德国，而且很多。所以你手里的那个，我能看出来它不是Creapure。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: higher muscle mass, that's you have higher creatinine levels. What you want to test a greater marker of kidney function and **GFR** is **cyatin C**. So all you have to ask, it's really easy. Ask your doctor, could I please get **cyatin C** in my blood work? And if that is elevated and without not within normal range, then maybe get off creatine. But right now, I cannot see any reason as to not have creatine every single day. I think every single person, no matter what age you are, everybody should be supplementing with creatine. Now, there was this uh recent study that came out on **menopausal women** and it was a really small study. It was a randomized control trial and they split women into four groups and these were **permenopausal women**. They split them into lowd dose creatine where I think they were having 750 mg a day, medium dose which was around 1.5 g a day. Then they had them supplement with a range of both **creatine monohydrate** and **creatine hydrochloride**. This was a hydrochloride creatine study. And then there was a placebo group. What they found was a very small study, very small group. What they found was that those in the medium range having the 1.5 had substantial increases in their mood and their cognitive functions. So creatine is now being explored in females across the lifespan as it relates to permenopause, pregnancy, menopause, and dementia. So there's just there it's it's it's phenomenal. The only thing I want to point out, what you want to look for when it comes to creatine are two things when it comes to manufacturing standards. You want to look A, has it been **NSF certified**? And B, you want to look for is it **Creapure**? And that's the gold standard of creatine and it comes from Germany and a lot. So the one that you've got there, I can tell it's not Creapure.

</details>

**主持人**: 对不起。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Excuse me.

</details>

**Louisa**: 我懂我的**肌酸**。你一眼就能看出它是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: I know my creatine. How can you tell what it is by looking at it?

</details>

**Louisa**: 我一眼就能看出来。我敢打赌一百万美元，它就是我所想的那个品牌，因为它有这种粉状的糖粉物质。如果是纯正的黄金标准**Creapure**，它会是颗粒状的。它之所以是这样，是因为很多制造商想在里面添加这些不同的**助剂**，以便它能很好地混合。这个可能混合得很好。很多，嗯，人们也抱怨服用后感到**胃肠不适**。我只想说，这不是停止服用的理由。也许一次服用两克，也许一次服用三克，但不要停止服用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: I can just tell. I can I I I bet you a million dollars that it is the brand that I think it is because it's got this powdered icing sugar substance. If it was pure gold standard **Creapure**, it would be gritty. The reason why it's like this is because a lot of manufacturers want to add these different **agents** in there in order for it to mix well. This probably mixes really well. A lot of uh people also complain of feeling uh **GI distress** when they take it. And all I have to say is that's not a reason to stop taking it. Maybe take two grams at a time, maybe take three grams at a time, but don't stop taking it.

</details>

**主持人**: 你会测试自己的健康状况吗？多久测试一次？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: What do you test for with your own health and how frequently do you test?

</details>

**Louisa**: 我每3到4个月测试一次。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: I test every 3 to four months.

</details>

**主持人**: 你测试什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: What do you test?

</details>

**Louisa**: 哦，我做所有测试。嗯，哦，我刚做了，嗯，实验室检查。嗯，12月15日，我生日的前一天。我每年都会做，你知道，大约那个年龄。但每年，有趣的是，我都会测试我的**生物年龄**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Oh, I do everything. Um Oh, I've I I just did um lab work. uh December 15th, the day before my birthday. I do it, you know, around that age. But every year, funnily enough, I test my **biological age**.

</details>

**主持人**: 你的**生物年龄**是多少？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: What is your biological age?

</details>

**Louisa**: 结果是22岁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: It came back as 22.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。你认为他们通常不做的最重要测试是什么，每个人都应该做？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Okay. What's the most important test they don't typically do that you think everybody should be doing?

</details>

**Louisa**: **脂蛋白(a)**会增加你患**心脏相关事件**或**心血管疾病**的风险，但它是遗传性的。然后对于**痴呆症**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: **Lipoprotein little a** raises your risk of having a **heart related event** or raises your risk of getting **cardiovascular disease**, but it's hereditary. And then for for dementia,

</details>

**Louisa**: 这至少在美国是一个非常令人兴奋的部分。我们现在有一种可预测的方法来发现**轻度认知障碍**和这些**阿尔茨海默病标志物**。**Tau蛋白**、**PTA 217**，它在血液检查中被称为，以及**淀粉样β蛋白**。所以我们现在可以用90%的准确率通过血液检查发现这些，与**PET扫描**相当。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: this is a really exciting part at least in the US. We now have a predictable way of picking up on **mild cognitive impairment** and picking up on these Alzheimer's hallmarks. **Tao protein**, **PTA 217**, it's called on blood work and **amaloid beta**. So we can now pick up on this with 90% accuracy of a **PET scan**.

</details>

**主持人**: 那些卡片是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: What are those cards over there?

</details>

**Louisa**: 这些是用来测试你的**处理速度**的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: These are here to test your **processing speed**.

</details>

**主持人**: 粉色。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Pink.

</details>

**Louisa**: 所以。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: So,

</details>

**主持人**: 它上面写着粉色。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: it says pink on it.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的。所以，这实际上是衡量**大脑功能**的一个很好的指标。你的大脑处理视觉信息的速度比书面文字快15倍。所以，这将测试你的大脑功能。好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yeah. So, this is actually a great measure of **brain function**. Your brain processes visual information 15 times faster than written words. And so, this is going to test your uh brain function. Okay.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以，我希望你做的是，你会看到颜色。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So, what I want you to do is you're going to see the color.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 我希望你实际上说出卡片的颜色，而不是单词。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I want you to actually say the color of the card, not the word.

</details>

**Louisa**: 好的。让我先编程我的大脑。说颜色，而不是单词。好的。你准备好了吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Okay. Let me just program my brain. Say the color, not the word. Okay. Are you ready?

</details>

**主持人**: 绿色，橙色，黄色，绿色，橙色，绿色，橙色，黄色，粉色，橙色，绿色。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Green, orange, yellow, green, orange, green, orange, yellow, pink, orange, green.

</details>

**主持人**: 现在，我们反过来。我希望你说出单词。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Now, let's do the reverse. I want you to say the words.

</details>

**Louisa**: 等一下，让我。好的。黄色，蓝色，绿色，黑色，紫色。棕色。

<details>

</details>

**主持人**: 你让他措手不及，他没有**肌酸**。那在后面。拿肌酸。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: You caught him off guard and he hasn't got creepy. And that's behind there. Grabs a creep.

</details>

**Louisa**: 他。这不公平。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: He It's an unfair advantage.

</details>

**Louisa**: 好的，你准备好了吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Okay, you ready?

</details>

**主持人**: 等一下。那我该怎么做？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Wait. So, what am I doing?

</details>

**Louisa**: 只说卡片的颜色。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Just say the color of the card.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的，只说卡片的颜色。是的。好的。准备好了吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Okay, just the color of the card. Yeah. Okay. Ready?

</details>

**Louisa**: 绿色。呃，橙色，粉色，黄色，黄色。是的。橙色，粉色。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Green. Uh, orange, pink, yellow, yellow. Yeah. Orange, pink.

</details>

**主持人**: 现在，我们反过来。我希望你说出卡片上的内容。所以，只读它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Now, let's rolls reverse. I want you to say what's on the card itself. So, just read it.

</details>

**Louisa**: 好的。棕色，紫色，粉色，绿色，黑色，黄色。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Okay. Brown, purple, pink, green, black, yellow.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。所以，现在我们要进一步测试它。那是开始的。不好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Okay. So, now we're going to test it even more. That was the starting one. Not good.

</details>

**Louisa**: 没那么糟。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Not too bad.

</details>

**Louisa**: 那还不错。所以，我希望你。这实际上需要我们站起来，使用一个**网球**。所以，我们要训练你的**视觉皮层**，它位于大脑后部的**枕叶**。我们要训练你的，嗯，**处理速度**，你的**反应时间**，你的**手眼协调能力**。你能做的最好的锻炼之一，体育锻炼，实际上是**手眼协调训练**。**网球**，**球拍运动**。但我将向你展示每天5分钟如何改善你的**认知储备**和**大脑表现**，只需使用一个网球和一个眼罩。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: That was not too bad. So, I want you This actually involves us standing up and using a **tennis ball**. So, we're going to train your **visual cortex**, which sits at the back here in the **occipital lobe**. We're going to train your um **processing speed**, your **reaction time**, your **hand eye coordinations**. One of the best exercises that you can do, physical exercises, is actually **hand eye coordination drills**. **Tennis**, **racket sports**. But I'm going to show you what 5 minutes a day can do for your **cognitive reserve** and your **brain performance** just using a tennis ball and an eye patch.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。所以。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Okay. So,

</details>

**Louisa**: 首先。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: first things first,

</details>

**Louisa**: 我要给你这个**网球**。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: I'm going to give you this tennis ball. Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 整个过程中，我希望你用**上手握法**扔球。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And for the whole time, I want you to throw the ball with an **overhand grip**.

</details>

**Louisa**: 哦，像这样？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Oh, like this?

</details>

**主持人**: 对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yep.

</details>

**Louisa**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Okay.

</details>

**Louisa**: 所以，我希望你只用右臂扔球，用右臂接球。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: So, I want you to just throw it with the right arm and catch with the right arm.

</details>

**主持人**: 上手。我的意思是，这是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Over. I mean, what's this one?

</details>

**Louisa**: 下手。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Underarm.

</details>

**主持人**: 我只是检查墙壁。好的。好的。所以，像这样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I'm just checking the wall. Okay. Okay. So, like this.

</details>

**Louisa**: 所以，你可能想退到椅子后面。好的。不，你会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: So, you might want to move back where the chair is. Okay. No, you would.

</details>

**主持人**: 剪掉那个。剪掉那个。很好。现在用右手扔，用左手接，然后交替。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: cut that. Cut that out. Good. So now throw with the right and catch with the left and alternate.

</details>

**Louisa**: 对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yep.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Okay.

</details>

**Louisa**: 你做到了。所以我们正在做的，我们正在调动几乎所有的**执行功能**。现在你有手。你应该能这样做一分钟。好的。好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: You've got it. So what we're doing, we're engaging almost all the **executive functions**. Now you've got hand. You should be able to do this for a minute. Okay. Okay.

</details>

**主持人**: 现在我们要让它更难。这就像放置重量一样。嗯，我不会做戴眼罩的那个。我做下一个。好的。所以，基本上你想做的是，如果你用黑球做，它实际上，哦，甚至更好。所以，现在我们要让它有点难，有点神经要求高。我们要给你戴上**眼罩**，它会真正遮挡大约50%的视力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Now we're going to make it even harder. It's like placing weight as well. Well, I I'm not going to do the one with the eye patch. I'll do the next one. Okay. So, basically what you want to do, and if you do it with a black ball, it's actually Oh, even better. So, now we're going to make it a bit hard and a bit neurally demanding. We're going to put an **eye patch** on you, which is really going to block out like 50% of the vision.

</details>

**Louisa**: 好的。哪只眼睛？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Okay. Which eye?

</details>

**主持人**: 任何一只眼睛。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Any eye.

</details>

**Louisa**: 现在，我们看看你能做多少个。我想我们之前数了大约八个。一个海盗。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Now, let's see how many you can do. I think you we counted around eight before. a pirate.

</details>

**主持人**: 我只需要你看着。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I just need you to look at.

</details>

**Louisa**: 什么？等等，这不好看。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: what? Wait, this is not flattering.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。

**Louisa**: Oh, that's so different.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Louisa**: 哇。这感觉明显更难。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Wow. This feels significantly harder.

</details>

**主持人**: 我知道。来吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I know. Let's go.

</details>

**Louisa**: 这感觉。不，这感觉真的很难。让我再检查一下。地狱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: This feels No, this feels like really hard. Let me just double check. hell.

</details>

**主持人**: 那太难了。这。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: That's That's really That's so hard. This is.

</details>

**Louisa**: 你做到了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: There you go. You've got it.

</details>

**主持人**: 开玩笑。好的，现在我们交替。左手，右手。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Joking. Okay, let's alternate now. Left hand, right hand,

</details>

**Louisa**: 左手，右手，像这样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: left hand, right around like this.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。你正在训练你的视觉系统在负荷和压力下工作。所以，当你这样做时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah, you're training your visual system to work under load and under stress. So, when you do this,

</details>

**Louisa**: 我打断你了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: I'm interrupting you.

</details>

**主持人**: 不，没关系。你做到了。你做到了。你做到了。很好。很好。很好。然后为了让它更难。好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: No, it's okay. You got it. You got it. You got it. Good. Good. Good. And then to even make it even harder. Okay.

</details>

**Louisa**: 站立在你的右脚上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Stand on your right foot.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。把你的另一只脚放上去。好了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. And put your other foot. There you go.

</details>

**Louisa**: 或者单腿站立。对。单腿站立现在正在调动**小脑**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Or on one leg. Yep. Standing on one leg is now engaging the **cerebellum**.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Okay,

</details>

**Louisa**: 我们正在获得**空间意识**。来吧。姿势。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: we're getting **spatial awareness**. Let's go. Posture.

</details>

**主持人**: 左，右，左，右。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Left, right, left, right.

</details>

**Louisa**: 哦，天哪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Oh my gosh.

</details>

**主持人**: 你做到了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: You got it.

</details>

**Louisa**: 我想看你戴着眼罩做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: I want to see you do it.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。哇。我的意思是，我可以很棒。我的睫毛现在没了。没关系。我们可以用AI去除。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: with the eye patch on. Yeah. Wow. I mean, I can be great. My eyelashes have gone now. It's okay. We can AI that out.

</details>

**Louisa**: 这看起来很棒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: This actually looks great.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Mhm.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的，我们准备好了。嗯，我怪我的指甲。我怪我的指甲。我们来做吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Okay, we're ready. Well, I blame my nails. I blame my nails. Let's do it.

</details>

**Louisa**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Okay.

</details>

**主持人**: 很难。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: It's hard.

</details>

**Louisa**: 太难了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: It's so hard.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么，这在做什么？它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And so, what is this doing? It's.

</details>

**Louisa**: 这正在调动**执行功能**、**处理速度**、**手眼协调能力**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: This is engaging **executive functions**, **processing speed**, **hand eye coordination**.

</details>

**主持人**: 你和**NBA球员**一起做过这个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And you did this with NBA players.

</details>

**Louisa**: 我和**NBA球员**一起做过这个，以提高他们的**执行功能**，缩短他们的**反应时间**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: I did this with NBA players to improve uh their executive functions, decrease their reaction time,

</details>

**主持人**: 如果我经常做这个，这会改变我的大脑吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: and this will this will change my brain if I do this frequently.

</details>

**Louisa**: 不仅如此，你还在提高**认知储备**。你正在建立脑细胞之间的新连接。你正在加强**神经网络**，你正在做一些不可思议的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Not just that, but you're also improving **cognitive reserve**. You're building new connections between the brain cells. You're strengthening **neural networks** and you're doing something incredible.

</details>

### 意志力与大脑可塑性

**主持人**: 所以做困难的事情会改善大脑功能，贯穿一生。做困难的事情告诉你的大脑，你可以做困难的事情。意思是，你听说过大脑中的这个小区域吗，叫做**前扣带回中皮质**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So doing hard things is what is going to improve brain function over the lifespan. Doing hard things tells your brain that you can do hard things. Meaning have you ever heard of this um brain area a little area in the brain called the **anterior mid singular**

</details>

**Louisa**: **皮层**？是的，我听说过。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: **cortex**? Yes, I have.

</details>

**主持人**: 你对它了解多少？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: What do you know about it?

</details>

**Louisa**: 我让你来说。

**Louisa**: I'll let you say it.

</details>

**Louisa**: 嗯，研究表明它在所谓的**超级老年人**中更大，那些衰老得很好，能够保持大量**认知能力**的人，以及那些能够很好地饮食的人，它非常显著。当我们做困难的事情时，它会变大。所以，当我们做真正困难的事情时，大脑中的这个区域会变大。基本上，那是什么呢？那是当生活变得艰难时的储备。这意味着它基本上告诉你的大脑，无论发生什么，无论遇到什么事件，我都有能力去面对它，欢迎它，并克服它，无论它有多艰难。当你放弃或不做困难的事情时，这个小区域就不会生长。它不会变大。所以做我们刚才做的这些**神经激活训练**，去健身房，远远超出你的极限，努力推动自己，将有助于这个大脑小区域的生长。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Well, it's shown that it's larger in what we call **super ages** and people who age really well and who can uh withhold a lot of uh cognitive capacity and it's really profound in people who can diet well. It gets bigger when we do hard things. So, when we do really hard things, this area in the brain gets bigger. And basically what that is, it's reserve for when life gets hard. It means it basically tells your brain that no matter what happens, no matter what event comes my way, I have the ability to go in, welcome it, and push through it no matter how hard it's going to be. When you give up or when you don't do hard things, this little area doesn't grow. It doesn't get bigger. So doing these **neural activating** uh drills that we just did, going to the gym and pushing well above your threshold and pushing really hard is going to help uh grow this little area of the brain.

**主持人**: 他们称之为**意志力肌肉**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And they call this the willpower muscle.

</details>

**Louisa**: **意志力**。这就是为什么我认为，嗯，当人们在一年中设定目标时，他们会说：“我要减掉20磅。我要做这个。我只是要增加我的意志力。”我认为这不是意志力，而是**神经生物学**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: The **willpower**. This is why I think that um when people go out to set their goals during the year and they say, "I'm going to lose 20 pounds. I'm going to do this. I'm just going to increase my willpower." I think it's not willpower, it's **neurobiology**.

</details>

**主持人**: 我认为花一点时间谈论大脑的这个部分非常重要，因为当我发现它时，我发现它绝对令人着迷。我认为是**Andrew Huberman**说的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I think it's really important to just spend a little bit of moment talking about this part of the brain because when I discovered it, I found it absolutely fascinating. And I think it was **Andrew Huberman** who said.

</details>

**Louisa**: 要么是对我说，要么是公开说的，他认为这是上个世纪最令人着迷或最重要的发现之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: either to me or he said publicly that he thinks it's one of the most fascinating or important discoveries of the last century.

</details>

**Louisa**: 当然，嗯，你思考我们如何生活。我们因为无法读书，无法集中注意力而惩罚自己。有多少，你知道，人们现在正在诊断，自我诊断自己患有**多动症**，**注意力持续时间短**，他们将其归咎于环境？他们将其归咎于环境，而他们应该归咎于**神经生物学**，他们应该归咎于他们的大脑状态。大脑的这个区域如果你能推动它，这就是为什么这些**超级老年人**似乎拥有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Of course, well, you think about um how we're living our lives. We're we're punishing ourselves for not being able to read a book, for not being able to pay attention. How many, you know, people are now diagnosing, self diagnosing themselves with **ADHD**, **low attention spans**, and they're blaming it on environment? They're blaming it on circumstances when they should be blaming it on **neurobiology** and they should be blaming it on their brain state. this area of the brain if you can push it and this is why these **super aagers** seem to have.

</details>

**主持人**: 什么是**超级老年人**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: what's a superager.

</details>

**Louisa**: **超级老年人**是指那些衰老得很好的人，他们一生中**心血管疾病**发病率低，他们保持了**认知功能**，他们在80、90岁时拥有50或60岁年龄段的**V2 Max**水平，所以他们在生物学上衰老得很好。所以这些，你知道，超级老年人有很多不同的方面，其中之一就是更大的**前扣带回中皮质**。相反，**AMCC（前扣带回中皮质）**在那些久坐不动或回避挑战的人身上会萎缩。如果你在生活中过于保守，它就会萎缩。生长只发生在抵抗中。如果你喜欢洗冰浴，并且你洗了一次，你的AMCC不会改变。如果你讨厌寒冷，但无论如何都强迫自己去做，AMCC就会生长。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: a **superager** is somebody who is aging well so they're going through life uh low uh **cardiovascular disease** state they've maintained their **cognitive functions** they're at the age of 80 90 with a a **V2 max** profile of maybe a 50 or 60 year old so they're aging quite well biologically. So these you know super ages have many many different facets to them and one of them is a larger **mid singular cortex**. Conversely the **AMCC anterior midsular cortex** shrinks in people who live sedentary lives or avoid challenges. It literally atrophies if you play it safe in life too often. Growth only occurs during resistance. If you love taking ice baths and you take one, your AMCC doesn't change. If you hate the cold but force yourself to do it anyway, the AMCC grows.

</details>

**主持人**: 科学家现在将**AMCC**视为**求生意志**的所在地。它的大小和活动水平是预测一个人在生活中遭遇重大挫折（无论是健康挫折还是手术）后能存活多久的有力指标。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Scientists now view the **AMCC** as the seat of the **will to live**. Its size and activity level are strong predictors of how long an individual will survive after a major setback in their life, whether it's a health setback or a surgery.

</details>

**Louisa**: 这也有些哲学意味。你知道，如果你，我不知道你是否读过**斯多葛主义**或类似的东西，但它确实可以追溯到**斯多葛学派**如何生活，特别是**马可·奥勒留**，他能够克服艰难时期。他们当时并不知道，这是大脑中的这个小区域。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: There's something really philosophical about that as well. You know, if you I don't know if you read um **stoicism** or anything, but it it it really dates back to how the **Stoics** lived their life, especially **Marcus Aurelius**, with being able to push through hard times. Little did they know that it was this little area in the brain.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。是的，我想我前几天讲了**罗斯福**的故事，他年轻时发生的事情。有一天他在情人节回家，发现他的母亲和刚生下新生儿的妻子都去世了，一个在楼上，一个在楼下。他去了**恶地**，我想是两到四年。美国的恶地就是这样一个可怕的自然之地，他会在凌晨4点起床，在冰天雪地里骑马，马会因为太可怕而站着死去。他做了两年，来处理悲伤。但当他从恶地回来纽约市后，他所有的朋友都说他完全变了一个人。他拥有了，而现在从神经科学的角度来看，他们知道他不仅仅是锻炼了肌肉。他实际上重新连接了他的大脑。他成为了有史以来最年轻的美国总统。他在一次演讲中被枪击，但继续演讲。他领导了各种战争。他简直令人难以置信。我想他获得了**诺贝尔奖**。他们指出在恶地的那两年，说那实际上不仅塑造了他这个人，也塑造了他的大脑，他的**AMCC**。研究还表明，运动员始终表现出更大的AMCC体积，研究表明，与肥胖作斗争的个体通常AMCC较小，但一旦他们开始成功地进行具有挑战性的饮食或锻炼干预，它就开始生长。就是那个词“挑战”，因为当你对一个系统施加刺激时，它会适应和生长，这就是**神经生物学**最无限的来源。这就是为什么我们会看到这些**突触**的崩溃。这就是为什么我们会从5000到10000个连接变成2000个或没有连接。这些**树突棘**最终会崩溃，因为我们不做困难的事情。我还认为，深入**神经生物学**，你可以看到一切都是因果循环。如果你不做困难的事情，你就不会发展AMCC。你不发展AMCC，你就不会再做困难的事情。它只是一个循环，这就是为什么这么多新年决心在2月1日就结束了。这就是为什么我们有**肥胖流行病**。这在很大程度上也是为什么我认为我们面临着人们无法实现目标的危机。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. Yeah, I think I was telling the story the other day of **Roosevelt** and what happened in his life as a young man when he came home one day on Valentine's Day and found that his mother and his wife of who had just had his newborn baby had both died, one upstairs, one downstairs, and he went off to the **bad lands** for two I think it was 2 to four years. The Badlands in America were just this like horrific um natural place where he'd get up at 4:00 a.m. ride these like horses in the freezing cold where like the horses would literally die standing still because it was so horrific. He did that to two years to like deal with the grief. But when he came back to New York City after this two years in the Badlands, all of his friends said he was just a completely different man. He had and what they now know from a neuroscience perspective is that he didn't just build his muscles. He literally like rewired his his brain. He went on to become the youngest US president of all time. He got shot um during a speech and carried on doing the speech. He led the charge in various wars. He's just this unbelievable. I think he won the **Nobel Prize**. and they point at those two years in the bad lands and say actually that that forged not just the man but his his brain his **AMCC**. The studies also show that athletes consider consistently show much larger AMCC volume and studies show that individuals struggling with **obesity** often have smaller AMCC's but but it begins to grow the moment they start a successful challenging dietary or exercise intervention. that it's that word challenging because when you place stimulus upon a system, it adapts and grows and that is **neurobiology** at its most infinite source. And this is why we get the breakdown of these **synapses**. This is why we get into a place of going from 5,000 to 10,000 connections to 2,000 or no connections. these **dendritic spines** end up breaking down because we don't do the hard thing. And I also think being deep rooted in neurobiology, you can see that everything is cause and effect and it's a cycle. Uh if you don't do the hard thing, you don't grow the AMCC. You don't grow the AMCC, you don't do the hard thing again. And it's just this loop and it's this cycle which is why so many resolutions, New Year's resolutions end by February 1st. It's why we have the **obesity epidemic**. It's largely why I think we've got a a crisis of people not being able to uh meet their goals.

</details>

**主持人**: 我只是从进化论的角度着迷于为什么我们需要一个，以及为什么它不总是很大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I'm just fascinated from an evolutionary perspective as to why we needed one and like why it wasn't just always big.

</details>

**Louisa**: 在追求，你知道，进化上，在追求狩猎和外出寻找食物来源，以及在近乎饥饿的状态下，在艰难时期有动力去做这些事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: in the pursuit uh, you know evolutionarily uh in the pursuit of hunting and going out and and hunting for food sources and being motivated to do that in a near starvation state when times were tough.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以当生活变得更容易时，我们就不再那么需要它了，所以我们可以节省能量，所以我们可以在情况好的时候降低我们的意志力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: and so when times got easier we didn't need it as much so we could conserve I guess our energy so we could like scale down our willpower when times were good.

</details>

**Louisa**: 嗯，你这么说很有趣，因为这引出了整个**脑腐病**和**AI时代**。就像，你知道，在2024年，**牛津词典**，我想，将“脑腐病”命名为年度词汇。这很有趣，因为它与进化和这个**AMCC**正在发生的事情有关，意思是说我们只是每天漫无目的地浏览信息，训练我们的大脑从绝对什么都不做中获得这些小的**多巴胺**刺激，这些小的奖励。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Well, it's interesting that you say that because this brings up the whole **brain rot** and **AI era** just like with, you know, in uh 2024, **Oxford dictionary**, I think, named brain rot the word of the year. And it's interesting because it plays into evolution and what's happening with this **AMCC**, meaning like we're just there scrolling at mindless information every day, training our brain to get these small **dopamine** hits, these small rewards from doing absolutely nothing.

</details>

**主持人**: 你怎么看待现在大家都在用的这些**聊天机器人**，它们替人们写作、思考等等？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: What do you think of these uh chat bots that everybody's using at the moment to write for them and think for them, etc.?

</details>

**Louisa**: 哦，天哪。我认为它在令人难以置信的程度上，但也有毁灭性的危害。我自己就知道这一点。我曾是一名数学家。我获得了数学硕士学位，我当时能够用我的头脑和一支笔完成的**三角学**和**纯微积分**令人着迷。现在我出去，我用**ChatGPT**计算账单，账单上20%的小费是多少。它要花多少钱？我想我到底变得多笨了？所以我认为它既有好处也有坏处。我认为人们阅读书籍和锻炼大脑的速度正在下降。嗯，我们思考和运用认知的能力正在下降。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Oh my god. I think it's uh on the spectrum of being so incredible but being so detrimentally harmful. I know this with myself. So I was a mathematician. I did my masters of mathematics and I was able Steven to the **trigonometry** and **pure calculus** that I could do back then with just my head and a pen was fascinating. Now I'm going to I'm going out and I'm calculating on **chat GPT** the bill the the the 20% tip on top of this bill. How much does it cost? And I think how dumb am I actually getting? So I think it's both good and bad. I think the rate of decline we're seeing in people reading books and exercising their brain is declining. Um, and our ability to think and and use our our cognition is declining.

### 对社会与未来的展望

**主持人**: **Louisa**，我等了很久才问你一个特别重要的问题，那就是你显然对这些事情充满热情。有人可能会说你非常痴迷。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Louis, I've I've um waited uh a long time to ask you one particular question, which is I think is very important, which is you're clearly very passionate about this stuff. One might say you're pretty obsessed with it.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Do I?

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。为什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: You do. Yeah. Why?

</details>

**Louisa**: 我们生活在一个不允许女性要求她们想要什么的社会。我们生活在一个不允许女性要求她们需要什么的社会。当这种情况发生时，导致70%的**阿尔茨海默病**病例是女性。导致80%的**自身免疫疾病**是女性。这些都是很大程度上可以预防的疾病。当我问为什么，当我听到女性在学术文献中被严重误解，当我看到女性轻视自己的症状，或者她们太害怕向医生寻求建议，或者她们太害怕向其他人寻求建议，因为她们正在经历什么，或者她们对自己的某些症状感到羞耻时，我就会感到愤怒和充满热情。这让我想起了我的祖母，她是我最好的朋友。她的名字叫**Louisa**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: We are living in a society that doesn't allow women to ask for what they want. We're living in a society that doesn't allow women to ask for what they need. And when this happens, it results in **70% of all Alzheimer's disease cases being women**. It results in **80% of all autoimmune diseases being female**. And these are largely preventable diseases. And when I ask why and I hear that women are wildly misrepresented in academic literature, when I when I see women who downplay their symptoms or they're too scared to ask their doctor for advice or they're too scared to ask somebody else for advice because of what they're going through or they're ashamed of some of their symptoms, I get angry and I get passionate. And it reminds me of my grandmother who uh she was my best friend. Her name was **Louisa**.

</details>

**主持人**: 你是以她的名字命名的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: You're named after her.

</details>

**Louisa**: 我是以她的名字命名的。是的。我们每天都在一起。我现在很激动，因为我记得她。她不幸死于**胰腺癌**。是**卵巢癌**转移到了胰腺。她从不要求她想要什么。她从不要求她需要什么，那就是帮助。她不明白她的症状。她没有在需要的时候去看医生，因为她更倾向于照顾家人和家庭。当她被诊断出疾病时，我坐在她身边。那是在家里，医生来了。她做了家访，我的祖母看着她。她几乎不会说英语，她说：“求求你，我能做些什么吗？我不想死。”医生说：“很抱歉，你无能为力。”我每天都在医院里陪着她。我想起那件事，已经快20年了，但我想起那一刻，我责备自己，为什么我们没有给她做扫描？她多次告诉我们她的胃痛。她多次告诉她感到疼痛。她从不，她隐藏了她的症状。她一度几乎不吃东西，我们从没停下来思考为什么，她也从没停下来思考为什么。所以我每天都想起她。然后我也想起我的母亲，这些女性，你知道，第一代移民，我们从一个叫**塞浦路斯**的国家移民到澳大利亚，她们一直都是这样，她们把自己放在第二位，她们只照顾家人，我无法忍受这一点。当我看到女性作为患者或护理人员进来时，我心想，你难道不知道你有什么可以做的吗？大多数女性都不知道。我无法相信我们正在花费大量的金钱用于将我们送上火箭去火星，但我们还没有找到这种很大程度上可以预防的疾病的治疗方法。这让我无法接受。我不想看到女性经历这一切。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: I was named after her. Yes. And we spent every day together. And And I'm getting emotional now cuz I remember her. And she sadly died of **pancreatic cancer**. It was **ovarian cancer** that went to pancreatic cancer. And she never asked for what she wanted. And she never asked for what she needed, which was help. She didn't understand her symptoms. She didn't go to the doctor when she needed to because she was just more inclined to look after the family and look after the household. And when the time came that she was given her diagnosis, I was sitting there with her. It was um it was at home and the doctor came. She did a house call and my grandmother looked at her. She hardly spoke that much English and she said, "Please, is there something I can do? I don't want to die." And the doctor said, "There's I'm sorry, there's nothing you can do." And I spent every day with her in the hospital. And I think about that, it's been almost 20 years now, but I think about that moment and I kick myself thinking, why didn't we why didn't we get her a scan? She told us several times that her stomach was hurting. She told her several times that she felt pain. She never she hid her symptoms. She hardly ever ate at one point and we never stopped to think about why and she never stopped to think about why. So I think about her every day. And then I think about my mother too and these women, you know, first generation, they came uh we migrated to Australia from a country called **Cyprus** and they've just been so they put themselves second and they they just look after the family and I can't stand that. And when I see women coming in as patients or caregivers, I think to myself, do you not know that there is something for you to do? And most women don't. And I I can't believe the amount of money that we are spending that is going towards putting us on rockets to go to Mars, but we haven't yet found a cure for this disease that is largely preventable. It's just not okay with me. And I would hate to see women go through this.

</details>

**主持人**: 尽管已经过去了这么久，你的脸上仍然充满了情感。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: The emotion is still very present in your face even though it was so long ago.

</details>

**Louisa**: 已经很久了。我的意思是，我非常亲近她。我与我的母亲非常亲近。我每天检查她两三次。我只是觉得这不公平。我认为女性应该得到真相。她们被欺骗了。她们被低估了。我们需要改变这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: It was so long ago. I mean, I was very close to her. I'm very close with my mother. I I check in with her twice, three times a day. And I just don't think it's fair. I think women deserve the truth. They've been lied to. They've been underrepresented. And we need to change that.

</details>

**主持人**: **Louisa**，你的祖母，那些情感是如何转化为你现在这种不可思议的激情的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: with Louisa, your grandmother, what are those range of emotions that have turned into this incredible fire? You have.

</details>

**Louisa**: **愤怒**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: **anger**.

</details>

**主持人**: **愤怒**是其中一种情感。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Anger is one of the emotions.

</details>

**Louisa**: 对社会的**愤怒**，这个社会让女性承担一切。成为母亲、护理者、去工作、代表家庭。女性占总人口的51%。然后它变得，我觉得是政治性的，如果那是一种情感的话，因为你想到医疗保健，你认为医疗保健应该对所有人开放，但似乎尤其在这个国家，医疗保健只有高社会经济地位的人才能真正获得，这让我无法接受，所以它确实变得政治性，尽管医疗保健，是的，医疗保健是政治性的，因为政策已经制定，但一个有需要的女性是超越政治的。我的祖母是超越政治的，她的需求没有得到满足。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Anger at society that places women to be everything. To be a a mother, a caregiver, to go to work, to represent the family. women represent 51% of the total population and then it becomes I feel political if that's an emotion because you think about health care you think health care should be accessible to everybody but it seems as though especially in this country that health care is only really accessible by those with a high socioeconomic status and that I'm not okay with so it does become political even though healthcare I Yes, healthcare is political because policies have been set, but a woman in need is apolitical. And my grandmother was a-political and her needs just were not met.

</details>

**Louisa**: **愤怒**，对这个系统的**沮丧**，对我们仍然只有4%的女性服用**激素替代疗法**感到沮丧，因为她们害怕患上这种疾病，嗯，她们害怕患上**乳腺癌**，对那些承诺帮助你的行政部门的循环感到彻底沮丧。你仰望你的，你知道，你的政府和你的行政部门，当你看到**肯尼迪部长**在2014年上国家电视说：“**疫苗**完全安全。我所有的孩子都接种了疫苗。它们已经根除了世界上一些最致命的疾病。疫苗非常安全。”然后快进到2025年，说疫苗非常不安全。不要相信你的医生。你需要自己掌控自己的健康。你开始失去信任。这不是我们不了解情况。而是我们感到困惑，因为我们听到疫苗不好。哦，疫苗很好。疫苗真的很好。服用它们。不要给你的孩子接种疫苗。你这里有一些女性甚至不知道如何上网或预约血液检查。你期望她们自己掌控自己的健康。所以，看到如此脆弱的女性被兜售疫苗谎言，这让我很不安，而这些疫苗可能可以拯救她们免受疾病侵害，可能可以拯救她们或她们的孩子免受**流感**、**乙型肝炎**、**脑膜炎**的侵害，脑膜炎刚刚从疫苗接种计划中被根除。嗯，我不是，这不应该带有政治色彩。我是一个科学家。我不是。这不是宣传。这不是意识形态。这只是女性应该得到更好的对待。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: anger, **frustration** at the system, frustration at the fact that we still have only 4% of women taking **hormone replacement therapy** in fear that they're going to get this disease, uh that they're going to get **breast cancer**, utterly frustrated at the cycles of administration who vouched to help you. you look to your, you know, your government and your administration to look up to, to guide you when you have **Secretary Kennedy** in 2014 go on national television and say, "**Vaccines** are totally safe. I had all my kids vaccinated. They've eradicated some of the most deadliest diseases that have plagued this world. Vaccines are so safe." to fast forward to 2025 saying vaccines are so unsafe. Do not trust your medical doctor. You need to take your health into your own hands. You start to lose trust. And it's not that we're uninformed. It's the fact that we are confused because we hear vaccines are bad. Oh, vaccines are good. Vaccines are are really good. Take them. Don't get your kid vaccine. You've got women here who don't even know their they they don't even know how to get on the internet or order a blood testing. You're expecting them to take their health into their own hands. So, it upsets me that you see women who are so vulnerable being sold a a a vaccine lie which could potentially save them from a disease which could potentially save them or their child from getting the **flu**, **hepatitis B**, **menitis**, which was just eradicated from the vaccine schedule. Um, I'm not, this is not meant to be political. I am I am a scientist. I am not. This is not propaganda. This is not ideology. This is just women who deserve to be treated better.

</details>

**Louisa**: 哦，我当时大概18岁。

**Louisa**: Because when you know what the brain is that it is responsible for the life that we have and you can use it for your advantage to overcome any obstacle that comes your way you become obsessed with understanding it. **Metacognition** is thinking about your thoughts and every day if you can think about why you think about the things you think about you can challenge yourself to overcome any adversity.

**Louisa**: I'm still paying a cost. My health pays a cost. I've missed family events, traveling for my career. But I wouldn't have it any other way because the people that I've met have forged the way for me to live the life that I want. I'm surrounded by incredible thought leaders in health and medicine. And.

**主持人**: 那么，对你来说，在最深层次上，成功是什么？成功是什么？我们10年后再次见面。你说我的生活很成功，或者我感到成功。**Louisa**说我是一个成功的女性。那意味着什么？发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: so what is success to you then at the deepest possible level? What is success? We meet again in 10 years time. You say my life has been a success or I feel successful. I'm a Louisa says I am a successful woman. What does that mean? What happened?

</details>

**Louisa**: 能够控制我的**大脑状态**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Being able to control my **brain states**.

</details>

**主持人**: 能够控制你的**大脑状态**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Being able to control your brain states.

</details>

**Louisa**: 我认为成功和高效表现的终极形式，或者说能够发挥你的巅峰表现，就是能够从一种**大脑状态**切换到另一种大脑状态，然后能够恢复。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: I think that the ultimate form of success and high performance or being able to perform at your peak is being able to go from **brain state** to brain state and then be able to recover.

</details>

**主持人**: 你说**大脑状态**是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: What do you mean by brain state?

</details>

**Louisa**: 意思是，当你需要开启时能够开启，并调动其中涉及的**神经递质**。**去甲肾上腺素**、**肾上腺素**、**多巴胺**，但不要让它们持续过度活跃，并能够知道何时关闭。我认为这就是高效表现。改变我对此看法的书是**米哈里·契克森米哈伊**的**《心流》**，它实际上谈论了**心流状态**。所以能够知道如何在这种状态下区分自己。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: meaning like being able to get switched on when you need to be switched on and invite the **neurotransmitters** involved in that. **Norepinephrine**, **adrenaline**, **dopamine**, but not having that in constant overdrive and being able to know when to switch off. And I think that that is what high performance is. The book that changed my mind on that was **flow by Mihi Chicksimni**, which actually speaks about the **flow state**. So being able to know how to uh separate yourself in these states.

</details>

**主持人**: 除了你的职业目标之外，还有其他目标吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Any goals outside of your professional.

</details>

**Louisa**: 孩子、家庭、生活？爱孩子、家庭。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: kids, family, life? Love kids, family.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，当然。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah, definitely.

</details>

**主持人**: 很难，不是吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: It's tough, isn't it?

</details>

**Louisa**: 很难。我之前对我的朋友说，你知道，我有点以为我想要孩子的那一刻，他们就会出现。但这并不奇怪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: It's tough. I was saying earlier to my friend that, you know, I kind of just thought the minute I wanted to have kids, they would just appear. But it's not so strange.

</details>

**主持人**: 我也这么想，直到我意识到，哦，但我才是女人。我实际上也必须生孩子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: That's what I thought, too, until I realized, oh, but I'm the woman. I actually have to bear the the children as well,

</details>

**Louisa**: 这是一个巨大的牺牲，也是一种荣誉。这是一种荣誉、一种特权和一种牺牲，我认为每个人都，是的，我的意思是，我想我绝对想要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: which is a big sacrifice and an honor. It's an honor and a privilege and a sacrifice that I think everybody Yeah, I I mean I think I I definitely want.

</details>

**主持人**: 你对你所有的职业努力都抱有希望吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Are you hopeful for all of your professional endeavors?

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yes,

</details>

**主持人**: 你抱有希望。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: you are hopeful.

</details>

**Louisa**: 我掌控着。你认为我们作为一个社会会朝着好的方向发展吗，就**阿尔茨海默病**而言？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: I'm in control. you think we're going to move in a good direction as a society as it relates to Alzheimer's and.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的，我对此抱有希望。我对我正在传达的信息抱有希望。我认为，嗯，社交媒体正在提供一个免费教育的平台，让人们明白他们对自己的大脑有自主权。嗯，我不希望任何人来拯救我们，或者给我们一个轻松的前进方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yes, I I am hopeful for that. I'm hopeful for the message that I'm getting across. I think uh social media is providing the platform for free education and for people to understand that they have agency over their brains. Uh, I'm not hopeful for um anybody saving us or coming in and giving us a easy way forward.

</details>

**主持人**: 你有没有哪一天希望自己对自己的手艺不那么痴迷？有没有哪一天你觉得，你知道，我希望自己对这个不那么着迷？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Do you ever have days where you wish you were less obsessed with your craft? Has there ever been a day where you're like, you know, I wish I was just a little bit less captivated by this?

</details>

**Louisa**: 有时会。是的，我想如果我没有，嗯，我可能还在澳大利亚老家过着普通人的生活。我不是说那是什么。我只是说，你知道，也许我会以不同的方式度过我的生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Sometimes I do. Yeah, I think if I didn't, well, I'd be probably back home in Australia living an average person's life. I'm not saying that that's it. I'm just saying, you know, maybe I would have done it done my life differently.

</details>

**主持人**: 我也有那样的日子，我想，显然因为痴迷的大脑是做出这个决定的。所以很难脱离。但如果在我面前放一个旋钮，我能把它调低一点点，我会吗？现在，我痴迷的大脑是做出这个决定的。所以，我痴迷的大脑会说：“去他的，调高它。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I have days like that where I think if obviously cuz the obsessed brain is the one making this decision. So, it's quite difficult to detach. But like if you put a knob in front of me and I could just turn it down just a little bit, would I? Now, my obsessed brain is is the one making this decision. So, my obsessed brain is like, "Fuck it, turn it up."

</details>

**Louisa**: 但我想我有时会想。我就是我现在的样子，对吧？嗯，但我有时会想，如果我能把它调低一点点，我会不会整体上更快乐。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: But I think I do wonder sometimes. I am the way that I am, right? Um, but I do wonder sometimes if I would be happier overall if I could just turn it down a little bit.

</details>

**主持人**: 但生命的全部意义不就是认识你自己，并追求更大更好的东西吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: But isn't the whole point of life to know thyself and in pursuit of something bigger and better?

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的，是这样。但我有时只是担心我正在牺牲什么，以及在某个时候，我不知道，当我80岁躺在病床上时，我会不会回头说：“实际上，我做了一笔糟糕的交易。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yeah, it is. But I just sometimes worry about what I'm sacrificing and whether at some point, I don't know, when I'm on my deathbed at 80 years old, I'm going to look back and say, "Actually, I made a bad trade."

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，完全正确。但我们永远不会知道。我经常思考这个问题。我知道你经常思考这个问题，你会想，如果世界明天崩溃了，你今天会后悔没有做什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Well, exactly. And but we're never going to know that. I I think about that often. I know you think about that often and you think, well, if the world came to a a collapse tomorrow, what would you regret today not having done?

</details>

**Louisa**: 我想那会是和爱的人创造更多回忆。我想那是其中一个大的。我想。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: I think it would be like making more memories with people I love. I think that's one of the big ones. I think.

</details>

**主持人**: 你听到你刚才说的了吗？创造更多回忆。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: did you hear what you just said? Making more memories.

</details>

**Louisa**: 想象一下失去那些。想象一下一个充满。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: and imagine losing those. Imagine a life full of like.

</details>

**主持人**: 你知道创造这些经历和这些记忆，然后它们被从你身边夺走。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: you know creating these experiences and these memories to have them being taken away from you.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 无法认出你的妻子、你的孩子，照镜子时无法认出自己。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: To not being able to recognize your wife, your kids, and looking in the mirror and not being able to recognize yourself.

</details>

**Louisa**: 这就是为什么**阿尔茨海默病**如此令人厌恶、阴险、可怕，因为。是的。它只是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: That's why Alzheimer's is just such a disgusting, sinister, like horrific thing cuz Yeah. It's just.

</details>

**主持人**: 最令人心碎的事情是，当一个人还活着的时候却失去了他。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: the most heartbreaking thing to to lose someone while they're still alive.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的。而且失去你自己。我们有一位女性照镜子时说：“那是谁？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yeah. And to lose yourself. We've got this one woman who looks in the mirror and she says, "Who's that?"

</details>

**主持人**: 真的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Really?

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的。你知道，这很悲伤，因为两年前她认识我，现在她问：“你是我女儿吗？”当你每天都面对这种情况时，你会开始思考。你过着不正常的生活。你过着不平凡的生活，因为你确实会思考医学的方方面面。你思考历史。你思考疾病。然后你思考生活以及你花最多时间相处的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yeah. And you know, it's it's sad because two years ago she knew who I was and now she asks, "Are you my daughter?" And when you're confronted with that every single day, it gets you thinking. You don't live a normal life. You don't live an average life because you do think about every facet of medicine. You think about history. You think about diseases. And then you think about life and the people that you spend the most time with.

</details>

**主持人**: 我们有一个结束传统，上一位嘉宾会为下一位嘉宾留下一个问题，而不知道他们是为谁留下的。留给你的问题是，上帝对你来说是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: We have a closing tradition where the last guest leaves the question for the next not knowing who they're leaving it for. And the question left for you is, what is God to you?

</details>

**Louisa**: 上帝是那种你感受并信仰的，你看不见的力量。那种，嗯，基本上让你觉得有人在那里支持你，引导你，总是为你指明道路的力量。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: God is that power that you feel and have faith in that you cannot see. The power that um basically makes you feel like there is somebody there that has you and that is guiding you that always has a a path for you knowing.

</details>

**主持人**: 你相信上帝。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: you you believe in God.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的，我是，我是，我是基督徒。我是**希腊东正教**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yes, I'm I'm I'm a I'm I'm Christian. I'm **Greek Orthodox**.

</details>

**主持人**: 当你看到大脑以这种方式退化，你想到祈祷这个概念时，比如向上帝祈求帮助，难道不会觉得很，我的意思是，看着你的大脑退化就是绝望的定义。我想我从18岁起就与宗教作斗争，我来自一个非常虔诚的家庭，我看到了世界上的不公。似乎没有什么比看着一个人的大脑在家人面前退化更不公的了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: When you see the brain deteriorating in such a way and you think about this concept of prayer, like asking God to help me with something, doesn't it feel pretty I mean, it's the definition of like hopelessness is watching your brain deteriorate. And I think some part of my struggles with religion since I was an 18-year-old and I came from a very religious family was seeing injustice in the world. And there's doesn't seem to be much greater injustice than watching someone's brain just deteriorate in front of their family.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的。或者有人正在经历失去孩子，你开始思考上帝。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yeah. Or somebody going through losing their child and you start to think about God.

</details>

**主持人**: 人们祈祷我找不到钥匙。我希望我的足球队赢。我说那没用。如果祈祷**阿尔茨海默病**治愈的人都没有成功，那么也许我应该停止祈祷**曼联**赢球。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: People pray for I can't find my keys. I want my football team to win. And I go there's no point. If people praying for an Alzheimer's cure are having no luck, then maybe I should stop praying for **Manchester United** to win.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的。如果你理解我们是如何被带到这个世界上的复杂性，从受孕的那一刻起，从受孕到神经发育的那一刻，一个婴儿是如何形成的，以及一切必须多么精确才能让你以你现在的方式出生。它是如此美丽，如此奇迹，如此罕见。即使世界上有数十亿人，你也不能再只转向生物学了，你必须转向更宏大的东西。我过去，相信我，即使作为一个希腊人，作为一个读过圣经的基督徒，即使在我20岁出头的时候，当我进入医学和科学领域时，我也曾如此热情地认为我们生于肉体，死于肉体。但当你深入科学、医学和生物学的文献时，很难忽视上帝。很难忽视那里有一个更高的力量。为什么医院里有教堂？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yeah. If you understood the intricacies of how we were actually brought into this world from the point of conception, from the point of conception to the point of neural development, how a baby is formed and how precise everything has to be for you to come out the way you did. It is so beautiful and so miraculous and so rare. even though there are billions of people in this world that you cannot just turn to biology anymore, you have to turn to something bigger. And I used to, trust me, even as a as a a Greek, as a Christian who's read the Bible, I even in my early 20s when I was getting into medicine and science, I I I was so gung-ho about we we're born in a body, we die in a body. But then when you get so deep into the literature of science and medicine and biology, it's hard to ignore God. And it's hard to ignore that there is a higher power out there. And why is it that there are chapels in hospitals?

</details>

**主持人**: 因为人们想上天堂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Because people want to go to heaven.

</details>

**Louisa**: 因为人们想要一种替代方法来度过他们所能度过的一切。科学和医学无法提供的东西，相信一个不存在或尚未发生的事情就是拥有**信仰**。我在神经外科工作，有些病例你会觉得这个人不可能活着出来，而他们确实活着出来了，他们保留了**认知功能**，他们在切除了一个巨大的肿瘤后看起来几乎正常，这是一个真实的故事，肿瘤沿着一个78岁女性的脸部生长，她从法国来到这里切除肿瘤，她第二天怎么能走路，认知正常，甚至没有服用任何药物？这怎么可能？是上帝吗？仅仅是奇迹般的神经外科医生吗？有些事情是医学无法回答的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Because people want an alter an alternative method of getting through whatever it is that they can get through. Something that science and medicine cannot offer and believing in something that is not there or something that hasn't occurred yet is having **faith**. I work in neurosurgery and some of the cases you think this person's not coming out of here alive and the fact that they do and they preserve their cognitive functions and they look next to normal after they've had a massive tumor resected which is a true story from here the tumor was going all along this one woman's face who was 78 years old who traveled here from France to have the tumor reected how is it that she's walking and she's cognitively normal and she's not even on any medication the next day. How is that possible? Is it God? Is it just miraculous neurosurgeons? There's just some things that medicine can't answer.

</details>

**主持人**: 我同意。我，我，我认为我没有傲慢到说我知道，我很好奇，我想我永远不会知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I agree with that. I am I don't think I'm arrogant enough to say that I know and I'm curious and I think I'll never know.

</details>

**Louisa**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以，我想这就是我们需要有**信仰**的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So, I guess that's where we need to have faith.

</details>

**Louisa**: 对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Yep.

</details>

**主持人**: **Louisa**，非常感谢你。嗯，你所做的工作非常重要，因为，嗯，正是像你这样充满热情、如此痴迷且善于沟通的人，帮助那些无法接触到你所拥有的智慧、研究和信息的人理解所有这些事情。正是通过这种理解，我们才能做出更好的选择，保护我们的生命，保护我们的大脑，如果我们保护我们的大脑，我们就能保护所有重要的一切。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Louisa, thank you so much. Um it's very important that you do the work that you do because uh it's people like yourself that are so passionate, so obsessed and so good at communicating that um help average people who aren't who don't have access to the wisdom and the research and studies and information that you have understand all of these things. And it's through this understanding that we can make better choices and preserve our life, preserve our brains and if we preserve our brains, we preserve everything that matters.

</details>

**Louisa**: 对。谢谢你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Louisa**: Correct. Thank you.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以谢谢你所做的一切，我感谢你的热情和奉献，因为它非常非常重要。我知道它是有代价的。所以，我觉得有义务告诉你，作为一个不参与你领域的普通人，我们很感激。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So thank you for doing what you do and I appreciate your passion and dedication to it because it's very very important. I know it comes at a cost. So, I feel obliged to tell you that as a normal person who isn't involved in your field, we're grateful.

</details>

**Louisa**: 非常感谢你，**Stephen**。
