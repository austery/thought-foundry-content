title: Palantir CEO Alex Karp 猛烈回击空头 Michael Burry，解读AI泡沫与市场动荡
---
### Palantir CEO Alex Karp：我们是一家反常规的公司

早上好，很高兴见到你。我们之前在节目中请过你的传记作者，现在终于能和你本人对话了。Palantir 的财报可以说全面超预期，我们可以稍后讨论为什么股市的反应是这样。但昨天我听了电话会议，你提出了一些非常有趣的观点，关于为什么你认为这家公司，甚至你自己，被如此严重地误解了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is so good to see you this morning. We had your biographer on the broadcast before and we're speaking about you now in third person, but now we're doing it in first person. The earnings were a blowout, I think, across the board. we can talk about maybe why the stock market's reacting the way it is but you know I was listening to the call yesterday and I wanted to just for those who didn't get an opportunity to hear it I think you made some fascinating points about why you think this company and maybe even yourself are so misunderstood.</p>
</details>

嗯，有很多简单的方式可以误解我，我自己有时也误解自己。你知道，我们不是那种遵循传统剧本的公司。我们是一家反剧本的公司。如果谈论个人，我像是一个有阅读障碍、曾经并且我相信现在仍然是左翼的人，但我实际上捍卫的是进步价值观，这会激怒那些有“特朗普紊乱综合症”（TDS）的人，因为我认为民主党人已经不再进步了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well there are lots of easy ways to misunderstand me. I misunderstand myself and you know it's not like the super conventional playbook thing. Look we're an anti-playbook company. If you want to do the personal version. I'm like this dyslexic formerly and I believe currently still left of center who actually sticks up for progressive values which triggers you know TDS loving people because I think the Democrats aren't no longer progressive.</p>
</details>

而这家公司是以一种真正慷慨、独特的方式建立起来的，这只可能在美国实现，并且它实际上颠覆了专家们关于如何建立一家软件企业的所有假设。你对软件开发了解得越多，我们公司的崛起、成功以及在企业软件战场上的主导地位就显得越奇怪、独特和难以解释。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the company is built in a truly generous unique way which would only be possible in America and actually explodes every assumption of how an expert would build a software business. The more you actually know about building software, the more odd, unique and inexplicable our rise in success and I would say domination on the enterprise software battlefield looks and is.</p>
</details>

我想说，我的一个主要问题是，因为我们反对建制派观点——我们质疑了很多通常被视为“政治正确”的建制派观点，质疑了 Palantir 的每一个假设。涌入 Palantir 的投资者通常是那些用自己的钱投资的人，他们往往不属于投资者阶级，也不是专家。直到今天，专家们仍然袖手旁观，说“这不可能是真的”。而投资 Palantir 的普通美国人，可以说自二战以来第一次，获得了风险投资级别的回报。所以，在自己评估的普通人和仍然基于历史上不成立的假设进行操作的专家阶级之间，存在着巨大的鸿沟。如果你看看我们的财报，看看我们是如何发展公司的——如果你想看数据，我可以详细说明——我们取得了非凡的成果，而专家阶级却在观望，散户投资者则全力投入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and then I would say one of my main issues is Palanteer because we were anti we called a lot of things that are kind of establishment views that often are viewed as kind of being super woke into question in every single assumption of Palanteer. The people who piled in to Palanteer were people investing their own money often people who are not in the investor class non-experts and even till today the experts sit on the sideline and say hey this can't be true while the average American who invested in Palunteer and for the first time maybe arguably in since World War II average Americans got venture returns investing in Palunteer. So you have this massive divide between the average person who evaluated themselves and the expert class that still was working on assumptions that have historically not been true that obviously if you look at the earnings if you actually look at we grew the company I mean I'll go through if you want to get through the numbers but extraordinary results and then the expert classes we need and the retail people are all in.</p>
</details>

### 对决空头：Karp 猛烈抨击 Michael Burry

这正是我想要问你的关于误解的地方。很明显，存在一种误解。你看分析师，大多数分析师认为这只股票被高估了。还有像 Michael Burry 这样的人在做空它。到目前为止，所有做空这只股票的人都亏了。我想了解一下，如果你看增长轨迹、销售额——坦白说，很大一部分销售额甚至来自现有客户——在你看来，这家公司的最终规模会是怎样？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But that's what I want to ask you about in terms of the mis there because there is a misunderstanding. Clearly, you know, you look at the analysts, most analysts, you know, think that this stock is overpriced. You have people like Michael Burry out there shorting it. Everybody who's shorted this stock thus far has been on the losing end of it. And I'm trying to understand just if you look at sort of the growth trajectory, the sales, how much of the sales frankly I think actually even coming there was a huge part coming from even existing customers and just what the scale of this thing ultimately looks like in your mind.</p>
</details>

这里有两个部分。当然，当我听到卖空者攻击我认为显然是美国乃至全世界就影响力而言最重要的软件公司，仅仅是为了赚钱，并试图质疑我们拥有异常数据的 AI 革命时——比如 114 的 **40法则**（Rule of 40: 衡量SaaS公司健康状况的指标，即增长率与利润率之和应大于40%）等等——这让我非常愤怒。因为这些人可以挑世界上任何一家公司下手，他们偏偏要挑那个真正帮助人们、为普通人赚钱、支持我们战士的公司。他们为什么非要跟我们过不去？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, there are two parts. You know, of course, when I hear short sellers attacking what I believe is clearly the most important software company in America and therefore in the world in terms of our impact simply to make money and calling trying to call the AI revolution into question where we have these this anomalous numbers 114, rule of 40, etc., it just is super triggering because these people they could pick on any company in the world. They have to pick on the one that actually helps people that actually has made money for the average person. that that is actually supporting our war fighters. Why do they have to go after us?</p>
</details>

但我告诉你，这极具激励作用。因为我告诉你为什么卖空者总是被 Palantir 搞得焦头烂额：因为每当他们做空我们，我们就会加倍努力，拿出更好的数据，坦白说，部分原因就是为了让他们变得更穷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I'll tell you what though, it's crazy motivating because I'll tell you why the short sellers are constantly getting screwed by Palanteer because every time they short us, we just are like tripling down on getting the better numbers and part honestly to make them poorer.</p>
</details>

关于公司的实际实力和它到底值多少钱的问题？归根结底，你总是需要问一个问题：这个人是有说服力，还是他是对的？在各种运动中，无论是政治上的，还是民主党中那些倒退的部分，你都能看到这一点。我们可能即将面临一场彻底的灾难。我出生在纽约，但如果你真的问：“这些东西真的有效吗？”每个人都会说：“当然，我不会投票给那个。”但他们却问：“这在理论上可行吗？”对于那些理论家，你必须问，你有多经常是正确的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But okay, so the question of like the actual power of the business and what is it worth? I mean, at the end of the day, one of the things that is actually in the book, the biography, and that I actually think that you always have to ask to the is the person persuasive or are they right? And across all sorts of movements, political, I mean, you see this on the regressive part of the Democratic party. We're about to probably have a complete disaster. I was born in New York. Like, but if you actually said, "Do these things actually work?" Everyone's like, "Of course, I'm not going to vote for that." But instead, they asked, "Does it work in theory?" The theoreticians, you have to ask, how often have you been right?</p>
</details>

Palantir 关注的是务实的决策，为美国及其盟友创造不公平的优势。在这一点上，近 20 年来，我们在所有重大决策上都是正确的。我相信我们未来也会是正确的。现在，你可以争论估值问题。他们一直认为 Palantir 在 10 美元时被高估，在 20 美元时也被高估。我今天不是来谈论估值的。我只是想说，你去世界上找一家公司，它的 40 法则得分是 114，美国商业业务增长 121%，美国总增长 77%，产生的自由现金流异常充裕，并且与客户完全利益一致。你自己去计算它的价值。但他们从事的是怀疑和犯错的业务，而我们从事的是为美国工人、美国战士和我们的投资者提供不公平优势的业务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And Palanteer is about pragmatic decisions that create unfair advantages for America and its allies. And on that, we've been right for almost 20 years on all major decisions. And I believe we'll be right going forward. Now, you could argue, I don't know, like they're constantly like, but they they thought Palanteer was overvalued at 10. They thought it was overvalued at 20. I'm not even here saying what the valuation is. I'm just saying find a company in the world that has a rule of 114 that has US commercial growing at 121% that aggregate growth in the US is 77% that has throwing off free cash flow in a way that's anonymous and that is fully aligned with our customers and you figure out the value but they're in the business of being skeptical and being wrong and we're in the business of giving an unfair advantage to American workers, American war fighters and our investors.</p>
</details>

做空是一个非常困难的处境，因为你可能血本无归，对吧？你可以把这些人逼到绝境。Michael Burry 下了一个非常大的赌注，差不多有十亿美元，具体是 9.12 亿美元。对他来说，这是一笔巨大的投资。当你说你会加倍努力时，你具体会做什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Being short is is a very difficult place to be because you can lose everything, right? You can drive these people into the ground. Michael Burry put a really big bet on. It's almost a billion dollars. It's $912 million. That's a big step for him to put into that. What when you say you redouble your efforts, what do you do? What do you go back in?</p>
</details>

嗯，首先，他实际上是在做空 AI。我解读的是，他做空的是我们和英伟达。顺便说一句，做空这件事非常复杂。甚至不清楚他是不是在利用这个消息来平掉自己的仓位。我的意思是，这些人声称自己有道德，但他们实际上在做空世界上最伟大的企业之一。我并非从理论上反对做空，我只是说，去挑那些没有从事崇高事业的公司下手。现在是我们与他们对立，这对我们来说是个好位置。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, well, first of all, he's it's like he's actually putting a short on AI. So, the way I read it was us and Nvidia and it's like the biggest position is you though. I'm just thrilled. Okay. So, and and then by the way with the shorts is very complex. It's not even clear that I honestly I think what is going on here is market manipulation. We delivered the best results everyone anyone's ever seen. It's not even clear he's not doing this to get out of his position. I mean these people they claim to be ethical, but you know like they're they're actually shorting one of the great businesses of the world. And I'm not against shorting as a matter of theory, but I'm just saying pick something that is not doing a noble task. And you know, it's us against them and that's a good position for us.</p>
</details>

你看，当你交出一份 40 法则得分 114 的成绩单时——对于非技术背景的人来说，一个令人难以置信的、奥运级别的 40 法则分数大概是 50。如果你在 50 到 70 之间，你就是奥运选手。而我们这个分数就像迈克尔·菲尔普斯或迈克尔·乔丹级别的分数，没有这样的分数。美国商业业务在近 15 亿美元的运营率基础上增长了 121%，美国整体业务在 45 亿美元的总基数上增长了 77%。顺便说一句，我曾预测我们会达到这个水平。所以，如果你想做空这个，请便。我们只会继续做我们的事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean look when you're printing a rule of 114 again people who aren't technical I think roughly a an incredible score like an Olympic grade score on rule of 14 is like 50 I mean that's roughly like if you're between 50 and seven you're an Olympic athlete a unique implement athlete this is like Michael Phelps like score like Michael Jordan like there are no scores like this there and and 121 growth off of almost a 1.5 run rate in US commercial and a 77 77% growth in the US and an aggregate off of an aggregate base of of $4.5 billion. By the way, I predicted we'd get here. So, you know, it's like I if you want to short that, be my guest. You go ahead. We're just going to go do our things.</p>
</details>

### AI 泡沫之辩：增长的真实性与工人的未来

Alex，我们听到了很多来自 Michael Burry 等人的言论，更广泛地说是关于我们是否处于 AI 泡沫之中，以及其经济模式是否合理。显然，在 Palantir 的背景下，它们是合理的，因为你们在那里简直是在印钱。但并非 AI 领域的所有公司都在以同样的方式印钱，它们在芯片、数据中心等方面投入了巨额资金。你如何看待目前这个领域的整体发展情况？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Alex, we've heard a lot of talk from the likes of a Michael Burry, but more broadly about whether we're in an AI bubble, whether the economics make sense. Clearly in the context of Palunteer, they do make sense in so far as you're printing money over there. Um not everybody in the AI space is printing money in the same way and they're spending an enormous amount on chips, data centers and the like. How do you see the broader space right now in terms of just how things are are are developing?</p>
</details>

AI 领域有两个微妙的问题。什么是可触达市场？以及，在这些可触达市场中，哪些是真正有效的？所谓有效，是指你能赚更多钱，且钱的质量更高。也就是说，顶线和底线都能增长。Palantir 做的就是那部分有效的、可量化的可触达市场，无论是在商业上还是在战场上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There there are two subtle issues in AI. What is the addressable market and what is the addressable market for things that work? meaning you make more money and your the quality of money is higher. So top line and bottom line grow talent we're in the business of the a part of the addressable market where it works and it can be quantifiable either commercially or on the battlefield.</p>
</details>

随着时间的推移，你会看到**帕累托最优**（Pareto Optimality: 一种资源分配的理想状态，即不可能在不损害任何一方的情况下使另一方变得更好）的出现，这意味着技术栈的每个部分都必须创造比其收费更多的价值。这是显而易见的。如果做不到这一点，那就会是泡沫。很抱歉，卖空者分不清哪些产品有效，哪些无效，但这些数据应该能告诉你，市场中有一部分，用你的话说，是在“印钱”。而这部分市场，看起来正是我们所拥有的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you that clearly and and over time you're going to have trader optimality meaning that every part of the a stack is going to have to create more value than they charge. That's just obvious. And if that doesn't happen it will be a bubble. And you know, I mean, I'm sorry short sellers can't tell a difference between products that work and products that don't, but these numbers should show you that there's a part of the market that to you quote you is printing cash. And it looks like that part of the market is the park we own.</p>
</details>

另外还有一个同样重要的问题：GDP 增长中有多少是工人可以获得的？我们称之为“工人可获得 GDP”。Palantir 的独特之处在于，无论是在战场上编写复杂行动脚本的人，还是在工厂车间制造电池或从事其他工作的人，都在通过我们的产品得到增强。这两个问题可以说将决定这个国家的未来。AI 能否带来 GDP 增长？这只有在实现帕累托最优的情况下才能发生。我们看到的方式是，客户支付的费用低于他们创造的价值，这并不完全等于帕累托最优，但这是异常的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's a separate question, by the way, which I think is equally relevant. What part of the GDP growth is available for workers? What we call worker available GDP? And that's like one of the unique things about Palunteer is whether it's on the battlefield like the people writing the scripts for these very complicated operations or building batteries or doing things on the factory floor are being enhanced by our product. And those two it's really those two questions are going to define arguably the future of what happens in this country. Does GDP grow because of AI which only can happen if if there's prao optimality or and and what the way we see it the c the customer pays less than the value they create which is abnormal uh not exactly equal prao optimality and that it's unknown honestly.</p>
</details>

目前，据我所知，他做空的两家公司（Palantir 和 Nvidia）正是赚取所有利润的公司，这非常奇怪。做空芯片和本体论（ontology）的想法简直是疯了。但撇开这一点，还有一个更大的问题，那就是普通美国人相信 AI 正在发生。他们只是不确定这是否会发生在他们身上，还是仅仅是我在变富。这是我们必须打的一场仗，因为如果你想要一个理智的社会，你不能只有我们的 GDP 增长，而没有他们的 GDP 增长。所以，找出工人能获得什么，并证明他们能获得，将是至关重要的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You have this massive growth but you know currently as far as I can tell the two companies he's shorting are the ones making all the money which is super weird like the idea that chips and ontology is what you want to short is batshit crazy. But leaving that aside, there's a bigger question, which is the average American believes AI is happening. They're just not sure if it's going to happen for them or it's just me getting rich. And that's the battle we have to fight because if you want a sane society, you can't just have GDP growth for us and no GDP growth for them. So like finding out what is available for the worker and proving it's available for the worker is going to be absolutely crucial.</p>
</details>

### 社会安全与阶级鸿沟：科技的双刃剑

因为 AI 的出现，我们的社会比五年前更安全还是更不安全了？我曾和 Lansdale 讨论过不幸的体育场馆和无人机袭击等问题，他说这是我们迟早需要面对的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Are we safer as a society or less safe than we were 5 years ago because of AI? And I wanted to ask you, I talked to Lansdale about unfortunately packed stadiums and drone attacks and and things like that and and he said that's something that we need to at some point face.</p>
</details>

有很多复杂的问题。有趣的是，在这本书里，提到了“监视国家”。我和 Palantir 历史上一直主张最大限度的安全和最大限度的数据保护。尽管有人告诉你 Palantir 是用来监视你的工具，但实际上，我们的产品架构使得在增强安全性的同时减少监视成为可能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, you know, there's a lot of complicated questions because there's like I mean it's so funny because you know like I mean in this book which is there's like a lot of it's true but then it's like the surveillance state. So like interestingly I and Palanteer have historically been on maximal safety and maximal data protection and the product is actually built despite you know if you if you're being told Palunteer is easy is the product you use to surveil you you're the mark like you know we actually so how do you have maximum safety where you can still have a personal life.</p>
</details>

我们社会的一个事实是，如果你有钱，你就会很安全。如果你处于一个更贫穷的环境，无论是工薪阶层、黑人、白人还是西班牙裔，你都会身处一个人们口头上支持你，实际上却让你生活在战区的环境中。无论是内城还是边境，我们的社会基本上存在阶级鸿沟，下层阶级的人们——白人、黑人、西班牙裔，所有人——他们承受了政策的所有负面外部性，而我们这些有能力坐在这里的人则过着美好的生活。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The truth in our society is you're pretty safe if you have money. What happens to you if you're in an environment where you're poorer, working class, black, white, Hispanic, anything is you are then in an environment where people are espousing they believe in what they're saying while in facto letting you live in a war zone. Whether it's the inner cities or the border, we essentially have a class divide in this society where underclass people, white, black, Hispanic, everyone, they absorb all the negative externalities of policies and those of us who can afford to sit here have a great life.</p>
</details>

在我看来，我们社会和 AI 面临的真正问题是，我们如何确保人们能参与到 GDP 中，这也意味着他们可以安全回家，可以上学，可以从学校回来，可以去边境而不会被枪击。我们社会不能有芬太尼流入。去年死于芬太尼的人比二战以来所有服役人员的总和还要多，而这些人几乎都是工薪阶层，这就是为什么没人在乎。如果他们是耶鲁大学的毕业生，你早就看到炸弹落在某个南美国家了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the real question for our society in my view and for AI is how can we make sure people participate in GDP, which also means they can go home safely, they can go to school, they can come back from school, they can go to the border and not get shot. We don't have fentinol coming in our society and you know more people have died from fentinol in the last year than all service members since World War II and almost all those people are working class and that's why no one cares. If they were Yale grads you'd have a bomb being dropped on some South American country. It would stop and we have that's so there's a huge societal thing.</p>
</details>

我们应该用技术做的是，确保那些生活最糟糕的人能过上更接近我们生活水平的日子，并确保我们的生活也能进步。但绝不能抱着将犯罪率降至零的想法，因为要做到这一点，唯一的办法就是将异常行为降至零。我们谁都不想这样，因为我不是唯一一个怪人，我只是更坦率地承认这一点而已。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, and these are the what we should do with technology is make sure the people who are living the worst lives live lives closer to ours and make sure our lives advance as well. But never with the idea that we're going to reduce crime to zero because the only way to do that is to reduce deviant behavior to zero. And none of us want that because I'm not the only one who's a freak show. I'm just more open about it.</p>
</details>

### 市场开盘分析：为何财报强劲市场却下跌？

好了，我们有很多事情要谈。我们有大量的财报，昨天有 Palantir 和 Grab。我想最重要的是，大家可能都在关注的是，我们的盘前市场相当红。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We got a ton of earnings. We had Palunteer and Grab yesterday. And I guess most importantly, what everyone is likely paying attention to is that we've got a pretty red pre-market. We've got a pretty red pre-market.</p>
</details>

首先，我们为什么是红色的？我认为这是聊天区里排名第一的问题。这是一个公平的问题，因为我们确实相当红。标普500指数下跌了1%。我今天早上5:30醒来，看到了这场“屠杀”，我试图弄清楚到底发生了什么。我没有一个明确的答案，但我有几个理论要阐述。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First off, why are we red? I think that's the number one question I'm seeing in the chat. And, it's a fair question because obviously we are pretty red. S&P 500 right there is down 1%. I woke up at like 5:30 today and I saw the carnage. I was trying to figure out exactly what was happening. I don't have a definitive answer. I have a couple of theories that I'm going to lay out and and then we'll go through them and kind of see what's going on.</p>
</details>

第一，十一月的整体波动性。Tom Lee 昨天谈到，我们可能会对涨幅进行一些盘整。很多人会问，什么涨幅？嗯，我想人们忘了标普500指数在十月份上涨了2.5%。所以认为十月没有涨幅的想法，我觉得人们是在开玩笑。当你看到指数时，这是连续第六个月上涨，涨幅为2.5%。所以是有涨幅的，可能会有一些盘整，这很正常。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Number one is the overall choppiness of November. Tom Lee was talking about this yesterday that we are likely going to have some consolidation of the gains. A lot of people like what gains? Well, I think people forgot we were up two and a half% for the S&P 500 in October. So, the idea that there were no gains in October, like I think it's, you know, people are trying to be funny. Like, oh, there were no gains in October. Like, no. When you look at the index, it was the sixth green month in a row, up two and a half%. So there were gains and obviously there might be some consolidation in those gains and that's rather normal to happen.</p>
</details>

第二件事，在过去24小时里疯传的是，十月份办公楼的**商业抵押贷款支持证券**（Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities, CMBS）的违约率飙升了63个基点，达到了创纪录的11.8%。这比2008年金融危机后的峰值10.7%高出整整一个百分点。这似乎是商业房地产领域一个更广泛的问题，而不是住宅房地产。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second thing which I'm going to share right here. Delinquency rates on commercial mortgageback securities CMBBS for offices surged 63 basis points in October to a record 11.8%. This is a full percentage point above the post 2008 financial crisis peak of 10.7. This seems like a broader issue in commercial real estate, not in residential real estate.</p>
</details>

另一个原因，高盛和摩根士丹利的CEO们在香港的一个峰会上表示，预计未来12到24个月内股市将下跌10%到20%，但他们也形容当前环境是“建设性的”。摩根士丹利的CEO表示，投资者应该欢迎与重大宏观冲击无关的10%到15%的回调。Citadel的Ken Griffin也补充说，市场已经深入牛市，这意味着你可能会看到一些回调。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Another reason right here is Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley CEOs were at a summit in Hong Kong and they said expect a 10 to 20% equity drop over the next 12 to 24 months, but they also described the current environment as constructive. Morgan Stanley CEO said investors should welcome 10 to 15% corrections not tied to major macro shocks. and Citadel's Ken Griffin also added that markets are deep into a bull run, which means you might see a little bit of a pullback as well.</p>
</details>

所以，你有十一月的盘整，有这个潜在的商业房地产问题，还有华尔街的大佬们说，“嘿，我们认为股市下跌10%到15%并不奇怪，因为我们已经经历了一轮大牛市。”他们并不是因为任何特定的宏观问题或环境原因才这么说，他们只是说，“伙计，我们已经涨了很多了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you've got November consolidation, you've got this commercial real estate potential issue that's going on, and then you got big Wall Street executives saying, "Hey, we think, you know, expecting a 10 to 15% drop in equities would not be crazy given the massive bull run that they had." And they're not really saying it because of any specific macro issue or any specific thing that they're highlighting in terms of like a environmental reason for for what's going on in the broader macro environment. Rather, they're just saying, "Dude, we've had a massive run."</p>
</details>

所有这些原因，再加上今天是选举日，你会有选举日的波动性。我认为所有这些问题的组合造成了这种波动，这确实很烦人。但是，是的，标普500指数下跌了1%，这意味着Palantir在一个惊人的季度后下跌了8%。

<p class="english-text">I think the combination of all those reasons along with the fact that today is election day. You've got, as Doug says in the chat, election day volatility. you get just got a variety of issues that's going on which I think are creating this type of volatility and obviously it's annoying to deal with. But yes, S&P 500 is down 1% and that means Palanteer after a phenomenal quarter goes down 8%.</p>

### Michael Burry 的大空头：11亿美元押注 AI 巨头下跌

我认为可能导致抛售的最大原因之一，至少对散户投资者来说，是 Michael Burry 回来了。他的 **13F 文件**（13F Form: 管理超过1亿美元资产的机构投资者必须向美国证券交易委员会提交的季度报告）被提前披露，他对 Palantir 持有 9.12 亿美元的看跌期权头寸，对英伟达持有 1.87 亿美元的看跌期权头寸。这是一个名义价值 11 亿美元的赌注。

<details>

<p class="english-text">The biggest reason but one of the biggest kind of viral reasons you could be seeing a selloff right here because I do think this is affecting market psychology at least for retail investors is this Michael Burry is back. His 13F was disclosed early and he has taken a $912 million put position on Palunteer and a $187 billion put position on Nvidia. That is a $1.1 billion bet in notional value.</p>
</details>

我认为这肯定也吓到了不少人，因为归根结底，不管你喜不喜欢 Burry，认为他是一鸣惊人还是一无是处，当有人拿出11亿美元做空两家刚刚公布了史上最惊人数据的大型AI公司时，这意味着他认为政策顺风、特朗普政府、财报结果、增长、势头，所有这些都不足以阻止这两家公司股价的大幅下跌。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I think this is also definitely freaking people out because at the end of the day, whether you like Burry, you think he's a one hit wonder or whatever, someone taking a billion dollars short against two of the biggest AI companies that have just put up, you know, some some of the most phenomenal numbers ever means that he's thinking that the policy tailwinds, the Trump administration, the earnings results, the growth, the momentum, none of that stuff is enough to stop both of these companies from facing a dramatic decline in pricing.</p>
</details>

他言行一致，把钱投了进去，这一点我确实尊重。顺便说一句，Suchin 今天早上发了一条很棒的推文，说有很多看空 Palantir 和英伟达的人称之为 AI 泡沫，但他们没有胆量真正把钱投进去。Burry 正在用实际行动证明他的观点，他说：“看，我认为这些股票会下跌，因此我持有它们的看跌期权。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And obviously he's putting his money where his mouth is, which I do have respect for. By the way, Suchin had a great tweet this morning saying there's so many bears on Palunteer and Nvidia that are calling AI bubble, but they have zero guts to actually put their money where their mouth is, right? Bur's putting his money where his mouth is, and he's saying, "Look, I think these stocks are going to go down and as a result, that's why he has puts on them."</p>

### 财报深度解析：Palantir 与 Grab 的冰火两重天

现在，Palantir 为什么下跌 8%？这几乎就是我们昨天讨论过的情况。Palantir 的季度业绩非常出色，收入增长 63%，净利润率 40%，客户增长 45%，总合同价值同比增长 300%。我能列出的每一个数字都无法充分说明这个季度的非凡之处。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why is Paler down 8%. Because of pretty much exactly what we talked about yesterday. You could have had a phenomenal quarter for Pounder, which by the way, 63% revenue growth, 40% net income margins, 45% customer growth, TCV value up 300% year-over-year. I mean, just every single number I could read off right here doesn't do it justice to say how phenomenal this quarter was.</p>
</details>

然而，这家公司的市值接近五千亿美元。这就是我们昨天讨论的重点。股价已经消化了很多预期，它可能会有一个惊人的季度。股价已经从 170 美元涨到了一度 205 美元，财报出来时甚至达到了 221 美元。现在人们因为它跌到 189 美元而抱怨。等等，这只股票年初时才 60 美元，2024 年 2 月时才 15 美元。人们却因为它没到 200 美元而生气。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, the company is almost a half a trillion dollar market cap. And this is what we talked about yesterday. It's like a lot is baked into the price and they could have an amazing quarter. The stock already moved from 170 to 205 at one point. Got to 221 right when the numbers came out. And people are crying because it's at 189. It's like, hold on. The stock was at 60 in the beginning of the year. The stock was at 15 February of 2024. And people are mad that it's not at 200.</p>
</details>

真正的 Palantir 投资者，而不是那些只想看到价格上涨或投机的交易者，明白那个季度的变革性意义。坦白说，他们可能也明白，价格需要与盈利增长进行盘整，这对公司规模化发展是相当健康的。所以对我来说，看到价格下跌并不是什么大问题。这是我们很多人即使在数据非常出色的情况下也预料到的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I know the actual investors in Palunteer, not the people that are traders that just got in because they want to see the price go up or, you know, wanted to speculate on it, understand how transformative that quarter is. And quite frankly, probably understand that the price needs to get consolidated with the earnings growth and that's rather healthy for the company at scale. And so, you know, to me, it's not that big of a concern seeing the price come down. It's something that I think a lot of us expected even if the numbers were phenomenal.</p>
</details>

现在来谈谈 Grab。我认为这是一个非常出色的季度。我知道股价没有反映出来，没关系。如果你根据股价来判断每一只股票，那么在分析公司的职业生涯中，尤其是在宏观经济不佳的日子里，分析股票会变得很困难。但是，如果你忽略股价，真正去看数字——最终股价会跟上数字——我认为这是一个令人难以置信的季度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, Grab. Let's talk about it. First of all, I thought this was a phenomenal quarter. I know the price action is not reflecting that. That's fine. If you judge every stock based on its price action, then I don't think it's going to be easy to analyze stocks throughout the lifetime of a career when it comes to analyzing companies especially on a day where the macro's down. But, if you ignore the price action, actually look at the numbers, which is ultimately what the price action catches up to, I thought this was an incredible quarter.</p>

收入 8.73 亿美元，增长 22%。按需服务的商品交易总额（GMV）增长 24%，他们实现了盈利。贷款额 8.86 亿美元，同比增长 56%。月度交易用户 4800 万，同比增长 14%，创下历史新高，占东南亚总人口的 7%。公司还将他们的 **EBITDA**（Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization: 税息折旧及摊销前利润）指引提高到 5 亿美元，这正是我模型中期望看到的数字，以期在 2027 年底达到 10 美元的目标价。

And that is now reaching an all-time high and 7% of the entire population in Southeast Asia. The company also raised their EBA guidance to 500 million. This was the magic number I was looking for on 500 million. That's representing 60% year-over-year growth in adjusted EBA, which is what's necessary in my model to get to $10 by the end of 2027.</p>

### 加密货币市场疲软：制度化进展与价格脱节

以太坊和比特币，我不知道这两个资产类别到底发生了什么。我想做更多的研究，看看这是如何发展的，但加密生态系统的思维方式似乎出了问题。要么是加密寒冬周期即将来临，准备好迎接这些资产的冲击；要么是一群巨鲸现在觉得无法继续持有多头头寸，想要锁定一些收益，结果你看到了下行压力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ethereum and Bitcoin. I don't know what the heck is going on with these two asset classes. And I want to do a lot more research on kind of how this is playing out, but there is something broken in the mentality of the crypto ecosystem. Either it's this crypto winter cycle is coming up and get ready for these assets to get hit or there is a bunch of whales that are just like not feeling the ability to stay long right now and they want to capture in some gains and as a result you're seeing some downside pressure.</p>
</details>

尽管我们看到这两种资产在制度化方面都有宏观催化剂——即世界上最大的一些机构开始将这些资产商业化；以及在稳定币和代币化方面——这是以太坊最大的顺风之一；但在降息、量化宽松、比十个月前好得多的货币政策、更好的监管框架，以及美国总统因其大量净资产现在都在加密货币中而非常有动力在加密领域做得很好的情况下，你并没有看到这些资产受到追捧。

<details>

<p class="english-text">you're getting a ton of pain even if you're seeing macro catalysts on both of those assets from an institutionalization perspective i.e. the biggest institutions in the world are starting to commercialize these assets and from a stable coin tokenization perspective which is one of the biggest tailwinds for Ethereum. If you take a look at callshi right here, there's a now or poly market. In the face of rate cuts, in the face of quantitative easing, in the face of monetary policy that is a lot better than what it was 10 months ago, and in the face of better regulatory frameworks and and in the face of, you know, the president of the United States being very incentivized to do well in crypto because a lot of his net worth is now in crypto, you're not seeing these assets catch a bit.</p>

关于 Schwab 和特斯拉，发生了什么？Jason Debbolt，这家伙持有价值数百万美元的特斯拉股票，他公开向 Schwab 叫板。他说：“看，我需要这周和 Schwab 私人财富服务部门的人谈谈。原因很紧急。你们至少有六只 ETF 基金，持有约 700 万股特斯拉股票，投票反对了特斯拉的董事会。我的 24 万特斯拉投资者粉丝都在问，为什么 Schwab 会反对历史上最成功的公司董事会之一。”

<p class="english-text">Okay, Schwab and Tesla, what's going on? So Jason Debbolt, this guy has like I don't know how many millions of dollars of Tesla. He publicly is calling out Schwab.

At least six of your ETF funds around 7 million Tesla shares voted against Tesla's board. And my 240,000 Tesla investor followers are asking why Schwab would oppose one of the most successful corporate boards in history."</p>

他还说：“作为 ETF 股份的托管人，你们的信托责任是为股东的最佳利益投票。如果 Schwab 的代理投票政策不能反映股东利益，我和我的追随者们将把我们总计数千万美元的特斯拉股份转移到一家能够这样做的券商。”

关于消费者状况，Clorox 的 Linda Rendle 表示：“消费者持续承压，对波动和不确定性做出反应，这体现在他们的购物行为中。”然而，万豪 CEO Tony Capuano 则说，高端消费者对宏观不确定性表现出韧性，并继续优先考虑旅行。所以他们不优先考虑 Clorox 漂白剂，但优先考虑旅行。这是一种持续的趋势：高端和低端消费者的分化。

<p class="english-text">Linda Randelle of Clorox and this is where the consumer pain is really being felt in some of these staples companies. The consumer continues to be under stress. Definitely reacting to the level of volatility and uncertainty that's out there and we're seeing that in their shopping behaviors. Marriott CEO Tony Capiano high-end consumers he says have demonstrated resilience to macro uncertainties and continue to prioritize travel. So they're they're not prioritizing Clorox, bleach or whatever. Um and they are prioritizing travel. Um and that's kind of a a continued theme. high-end, low-end is also obviously obviously a big one as we get through some of these earnings.</p>

Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi 今天早上在 Squawkbox 节目中对他们从消费者那里看到的情况相当看好。他说：“当我们看我们的业绩时，无论是高端消费者还是预算型消费者，他们都在持续增长。我们实际上正在越来越多地渗透到大城市以外的地区，我们在这些地区的增长率是大城市的 1.5 到 3 倍。所以我们没有看到消费者趋势有任何变化，它们依然强劲。”

<p class="english-text">Uber CEO Darra Kasra Shahi was on Squawkbox this morning. I thought pretty bullish about what they're seeing from consumers. Listen, when we look at our results in terms of the high-end consumer or the more budget consumer, they both continue to grow. We're actually now penetrating increasingly outside of the of the large cities and our growth rates outside of the large cities and some of the sparser geographics that we're going after are one and a half to three times faster growth than in the big cities. Uh so we're not seeing consumer trends one way or the other change. They continue to be strong.</p>
