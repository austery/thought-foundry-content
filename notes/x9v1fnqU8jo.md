### 全球秩序动荡

**Tracy Mumford**: 来自《纽约时报》，这是今日头条。我是 Tracy Mumford。今天，星期三，1月21日。以下是我们今天报道的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Wednesday, January 21st. Here's what we're covering.

</details>

**Zolen Keno Youngs**: 我是 Zolen Keno Youngs。我是白宫记者。随时，我将前往瑞士达沃斯参加**世界经济论坛**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolen Keno Youngs**: I'm Zolen Keno Youngs. I'm a White House correspondent. Any minute now, I'll be heading to Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum.

</details>

**Zolen Keno Youngs**: 该论坛是世界上一些最富有和最有权势的领导人的聚会，但所有人的目光都将聚焦在**总统特朗普**身上，因为他预计将在对**跨大西洋联盟**的未来深感担忧的背景下发表主旨演讲。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolen Keno Youngs**: The forum is a gathering of some of the world's wealthiest and most powerful leaders, but all eyes will be on President Trump as he is expected to give a keynote address amid very deep concerns over the future of the transatlantic alliance.

</details>

**Zolen Keno Youngs**: 本来会是世界精英们的一次头脑风暴会议，现在却变成了一场紧急的、全体动员的努力，以缓和与一位日益强势的美国总统之间的紧张关系。这是因为特朗普总统对欧洲领导人进行抨击，并威胁要吞并**格陵兰**。你知道，我一直在与外交政策分析人士交谈，他们说这个时期是不同的，对吧？是的，特朗普总统以扰乱全球峰会和，你知道，不顾盟友而维护现有全球秩序而闻名。但吞并格陵兰的威胁真的让外交政策分析人士质疑美国与欧洲国家之间近80年的联盟是否可能面临风险。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolen Keno Youngs**: What normally would have been a brainstorming session amongst the world's elites has turned into this all hands emergency effort to deescalate tension with an emboldened American president. That's because of President Trump's lashing out at European leaders as well as his threats to take over Greenland. You know, I've been talking to foreign policy analysts who say that this this period is different, right? Yes, President Trump is known for disrupting global summits and, you know, brushing aside allies that make up the current global order. But these threats of a takeover of Greenland really have foreign policy analysts questioning whether or not the nearly 80year-old alliance between the US and European nations may be at risk.

</details>

**Zolen Keno Youngs**: 我直言不讳。我们正处于一次破裂之中，而不是一次过渡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolen Keno Youngs**: Let me be direct. We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.

</details>

**Zolen Keno Youngs**: 在特朗普总统发表讲话前，加拿大总理**马克·卡尼**在他的演讲中谈到了日益加剧的全球紧张局势。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Zolen Keno Youngs**: Ahead of President Trump's remarks, the Prime Minister of Canada, Mark Carney, addressed the rising global tensions in his own speech.

</details>

**Mark Carney**: 每一天，我们都提醒自己，我们生活在一个大国竞争的时代，基于规则的秩序正在消退，强者可以为所欲为，弱者必须忍受他们必须忍受的。虽然卡尼没有点特朗普的名字，但他在总统在社交媒体上发布一张美国国旗覆盖加拿大的**AI图像**后不久发表了讲话。这是特朗普持续嘲讽的一部分，暗示加拿大应该成为美国的第51个州。在演讲中，卡尼呼吁像加拿大这样的中等国家联合起来，以抵消美国等超级大国的力量。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mark Carney**: Every day, we're reminded that we live in an era of great power rivalry, that the rules-based order is fading, that the strong can do what they can and the weak must suffer what they must. While Carney didn't mention Trump by name, he spoke not long after the president posted an AI image on social media showing American flags superimposed over Canada. Part of Trump's ongoing jabs that the country should become the 51st US state. In his speech, Carney called on medium-sized countries like his own to band together to offset the strength of superpowers like the US.

</details>

**Mark Carney**: 强权拥有他们的权力，但我们也有东西。那就是停止伪装、直面现实、建设国内力量并共同行动的能力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mark Carney**: The powerful have their power, but we have something too. The capacity to stop pretending, to name reality, to build our strength at home, and to act together.

</details>

**Mark Carney**: 我们要求我们的联邦政府做得更多，要求更高的专业性、更多的问责制、更多的人性。我们要求合法的、尊重人类尊严的警务工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mark Carney**: We demand more from our federal government, more professionalism, more accountability, more humanity. We demand lawful policing that respects human dignity.

</details>

### 移民执法争议

**Tracy Mumford**: 在**明尼苏达州**，高级警官们正在批评联邦移民官员使用的策略，称许多居民害怕外出，并且这些官员正在破坏执法部门的信任。在昨天与两位警长和一位县治安官举行的新闻发布会上，官员们表示，他们知道有美国公民，包括至少一名在执勤外的警官，曾被拦下并盘问。他们说，这些人都是有色人种。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: In Minnesota, top police officials are criticizing the tactics being used by federal immigration agents, saying many residents are scared to go outside and that the agents are undermining trust in law enforcement. In a press conference yesterday with two police chiefs and a county sheriff, officials said they knew of American citizens, including at least one offduty police officer who'd been pulled over and questioned. They said they were all people of color.

</details>

**Police Official**: 如果我们的警官都遭遇这样的事，我真不敢想我们社区里有多少成员每天都在遭受这样的不幸。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Police Official**: If it is happening to our officers, it pains me to think of how many of our community members are falling victim to this every day.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 尽管官员们表示他们不反对移民执法，但他们指责部署到该地区的**ICE**官员过于强硬。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: While the officials said they are not opposed to immigration enforcement, they accused ICE officers deployed to the region of being too heavy-handed.

</details>

**Police Official**: 我们能否找到一种方法，确保我们在做这些事情的同时，不会吓坏我们的社区成员，不会让每个人都惊慌失措？人们现在很害怕。我理解。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Police Official**: Can we please find a way to make sure that we can do these things without scaring the hell out of our community members and and freaking everyone out? People are afraid right now. And I get it.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 作为回应，联邦官员为明尼苏达州移民官员的行为辩护，称他们的行动是合法、合乎道德且符合道义的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: In response, federal officials defended the behavior of immigration agents in Minnesota, saying their actions are legal, ethical, and moral.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 与此同时，特朗普政府加大了对明尼苏达州批评其强硬移民执法政策的民主党官员的调查力度。**司法部**现已正式向包括州长**蒂姆·沃尔斯**在内的五名官员发出传票，因为政府声称地方领导人密谋阻碍该州ICE特工的行动。在未提供任何证据的情况下，副总检察长指控沃尔斯和明尼阿波利斯市长犯有恐怖主义罪，称他们鼓励暴力对抗联邦特工。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Meanwhile, the Trump administration ramped up its investigation into Democratic officials in Minnesota who have been critical of the aggressive immigration enforcement push there. The Department of Justice has now formally served subpoenas to five officials, including Governor Tim Walls, as the administration has claimed that local leaders conspired to impede ICE agents in the state. Without citing any evidence, the deputy attorney general has accused Walls and the mayor of Minneapolis of terrorism, saying they'd encouraged violence against federal agents.

### 德州移民死亡案

**Tracy Mumford**: 在**德克萨斯州**，一名在**ICE**拘留中心死亡的**古巴移民**的家人声称，他被狱警杀害。在一份新的法庭文件中，该家庭要求政府阻止驱逐另外两名据称是证人的在押人员。根据文件，一名在押人员表示，他看到狱警将该男子勒死。另一名表示，他看到该男子在死亡前与狱警搏斗。两人此后都收到了驱逐通知。联邦官员给出了不同的说法。起初，ICE表示该男子“正在经历医疗急症”。后来，在**《华盛顿邮报》**报道了该家庭的说法后，**国土安全部**的一名官员表示，他是自杀，并且“抵抗了安保人员的干预”。据该男子家人称，**埃尔帕索法医办公室**的一名工作人员告诉他们，计划将死亡原因列为他杀。家人分享了一段该对话的录音，尽管《纽约时报》无法核实。该办公室拒绝就录音发表评论，称尸检正在进行中。该男子死亡的设施是该国同类设施中最大的，约有2700名在押人员。去年，多个**人权团体**敦促联邦官员关闭该中心，理由是虐待报告。国土安全部称这些说法“完全是谎言”。

**Tracy Mumford**: In Texas, the family of a Cuban immigrant who died while in custody at an ICE detention center earlier this month claims that he was killed by guards. In a new court filing, the family asked that the government be blocked from deporting two other detainees who they say are witnesses. According to the filing, one fellow detainee said he saw the guards choke the man to death. Another said he saw the man struggling with the guards before he died. Both have since been given deportation notices. Federal officials have offered a different account. Initially, ICE said the man had been quote experiencing medical distress. Later, after the Washington Post reported on the family's claims, a Department of Homeland Security official said he had died by suicide and quote, "resisted interventions from security staff." According to the man's family, a staffer at the El Paso Medical Examiner's Office told them it planned to list the manner of death as homicide. and the family shared a recording of that conversation, though the Times could not verify it. The office declined to comment on the recording, saying an autopsy is pending. The facility where the man died is the largest of its kind in the country with about 2700 detainees. Last year, several human rights groups urged federal officials to close the center over reports of abuse. The DHS called those claims categorically false.

**Tracy Mumford**: 恐怖分子心中充满仇恨，但他们手中也有高能步枪。我们正在同时处理这两者。

**Tracy Mumford**: The terrorists had hate in their hearts, but they also had highpowered rifles in their hands. We're taking action on both.

### 澳洲枪管与言论

**Tracy Mumford**: **澳大利亚**通过了新的、更严格的**枪支管制**法律，以应对上个月在那里针对**犹太教**庆祝活动的一次大规模枪击事件。该立法呼吁实行全国性的枪支回购计划。它还限制枪支进口并收紧背景调查。此举呼应了澳大利亚在90年代发生大规模枪击事件后的做法。几乎立即，它收紧了法律并进行了大规模回购。澳大利亚五分之一的枪支被移出了公共流通。自那以后，该国的枪支凶杀率一直处于人均最低水平之一，但枪支数量已回升，目前处于历史最高水平。新的回购计划如何运作的细节尚未最终确定。与此同时，为应对国内日益增长的反犹太主义，澳大利亚议会还通过了一项针对**仇恨言论**的法案。它赋予当局更大的权力，可以拒绝持有极端主义观点的人入境签证，并将组织指定为仇恨团体，尽管一些批评者警告说，这可能会对**抗议**和**公民权利**产生寒蝉效应。

**Tracy Mumford**: Australia has passed new, tighter gun control laws in the wake of a mass shooting targeting a Hanukkah celebration there last month. The legislation calls for a national gun buyback program. It also limits firearms imports and tightens background checks. The move echoes what Australia did back in the9s when a mass shooting shook the country. Almost immediately, it tightened its laws and did a massive buyback. A fifth of Australia's guns were taken out of public circulation. Since then, the country has had one of the lowest gun homicide rates per capita, but the number of firearms has climbed back up, and it's now at a record high. The details of how the new buyback program will work haven't been finalized. At the same time, in response to rising anti-semitism in the country, Australia's parliament also passed a bill targeting hate speech. It gives authorities more leeway to deny entry visas to people with extremist views and to designate organizations as hate groups, though some critics have warned it could have a chilling effect on protest and civil rights.

### 新州草书教学

**Tracy Mumford**: 最后，在他任期内的最后几项举措之一中，新泽西州州长本周签署了一项法律，要求该州所有小学学生学习**草书**。是的，草书。所以，练习你的连笔吧，因为它正在回归。虽然联邦政府在2010年将草书从共同核心标准中删除，但新泽西州加入了大约二十几个其他州，在近年恢复了它。草书的支持者指出，有研究表明手写与更好的信息记忆有关。新泽西州州长还表示，这有助于人们阅读原始的美国宪法。并非所有人都赞同。一位教育学教授告诉《纽约时报》，虽然手写很重要，但专门重视草书可能仅仅是一种怀旧情结。诚然，阅读旧式草书是一门正在消失的艺术。国家档案馆去年实际上曾发出求助呼吁，寻找能够解读旧文件上字迹的志愿者。那将是一项需要记住大写草书Q看起来像什么的任务。

**Tracy Mumford**: And finally, in one of his final acts in office, the governor of New Jersey signed a law this week requiring that all elementary school students in the state learn cursive. Yes, cursive. So, practice your loop-de-loops because it is making a comeback. While the federal government dropped cursive from the Common Core standards back in 2010, New Jersey joins roughly two dozen other states that have revived it in recent years. Proponents of cursive point to studies that link handwriting to better information retention. And New Jerseyy's governor also said it can help people read the original US Constitution. Not everyone is on board. One education professor told the Times that while handwriting is important, valuing cursive specifically might just be a nostalgia thing. It is true that reading old school cursive is a dying art. The National Archives actually put out a call for help last year looking for volunteers who could read the script on old documents. That is the kind of task that would require remembering what an uppercase cursive Q looks like.
