### 皮克斯的创始愿景与文化基石

皮克斯凭借《玩具总动员》、《海底总动员》、《超人总动员》、《赛车总动员》、《怪兽电力公司》等作品，在动画界占据了主导地位。这家公司已经赢得了27项奥斯卡金像奖。今天，我们非常荣幸地邀请到埃德·卡特穆尔，他与史蒂夫·乔布斯和约翰·拉塞特共同创立了皮克斯。埃德还写了我读过的关于创造力最好的书，那就是《**创造力公司**》（Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration）。如果你还没读过，你应该赶紧去买一本。埃德，非常荣幸能邀请您参加播客。

<p class="english-text">Pixar has dominated the world of animation with titles like Toy Story, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Cars, Monsters, Inc. The firm has won 27 Academy Awards, and today we are in the very, very good company with Ed Catmull, who started it with Steve Jobs and John Lasseter. Now, Ed also wrote the best book I have ever read about creativity, namely Creativity, Inc. If you haven't read it, you should run out and buy it. So, Ed, what an honor to have you on the podcast. It's my pleasure to be here.</p>
</details>

埃德，当您创立皮克斯时，您对公司的愿景是什么？最初，愿景只是制作第一部动画电影。在制作过程中，我和我们从技术愿景转向了管理和文化愿景。这花了一段时间才弄明白，经过多年的观察其他公司犯错并从中学习，同时也发现管理对我个人来说非常有趣。所以我从一个技术人员转变为一名管理者，但这个过程是逐步演进的，没有经过任何培训，一切都是在实践中学习。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ed, when you started Pixar, what was your vision for the firm? Well, initially, the vision was just to make the first animated film, and in the process of doing that, I and we transferred from like a technical vision to a management and a cultural vision, and it took a while to figure this out, many years of observing other companies, making mistakes and learning, but also finding that managing for me personally was extremely interesting. So I went from being a technical person to a manager, but evolved over time, no training, it's just all learning as you go.</p>
</details>

在您观察和工作过程中，您有什么样的文化使命？我很幸运，在我读研究生时，我的前两位老师后来都因完全不同的原因获得了**图灵奖**（Turing Award: 计算机科学领域的最高荣誉）。其中一位是艾伦·凯，他让我深刻理解到事物将以指数级速度变化。另一位是伊凡·萨瑟兰，他基本上是在说，你的宏大愿景是什么并不重要，你必须现在就解决问题。所以这是事情的两个方面，但更重要的一点是，我在读研究生时非常喜欢那里的文化，它充满支持，每个人都齐心协力，没有真正的阶级结构。当我离开时，我对自己说，这就是我余生想要拥有的环境。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Observing and learning from the mistakes. As you observe this and as you worked, what kind of cultural mission did you have? Well, I was fortunate in that when I started off in graduate school, my first two teachers later received the Turing Award for entirely different reasons. One of them was Alan Kay, who pretty much ingrained me the notion that things were going to change at an exponential rate, but the other one was from Ivan Sutherland, who was basically saying it doesn't matter what your big vision is, you got to solve the problem now. So these are the two sides of it, but one of the more important things was that when I was at in graduate school, I loved the culture. It was supportive, everybody was in this together, there was no real class structure, and when I left, I just said to myself, this is the kind of environment that I would like to have for the rest of my life.</p>

### 集体创造力的核心原则

在您的书中，您提到了关于实现集体创造力的三个重要观点。其中之一是，您应该将创意权力交给项目负责人，而不是高管。为什么这很重要？项目需要领导力，但同时，如果一切都是自上而下的，那就意味着公司最高层的人在做决定，但公司最高层的人实际上往往并不确切知道正在发生什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the things you talk about in your book, what actually about three important points in terms of getting collective creativity. One is that you should put the creative authority in the hand of a project leader rather than an executive. Why is that important? Projects need leadership with them, but at the same time, if everything is topped down, then that means the person who is at the top of the company is making the decisions, but the person at the top of the company actually often doesn't know exactly what what's going on.</p>
</details>

所以，从我的角度来看，这意味着那些负责运营的人，包括我们的董事长兼投资者史蒂夫·乔布斯，我们都没有假装自己是电影制作人。电影制作人就在那里，他们必须做出决定，但我们也知道这些决定很艰难。你本质上必须信任他们，因为当你开始时，什么都不会顺利。如果你不这样做，他们就不会解决问题。你不想成为他们的问题，你希望他们拥有制作电影的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, from my point of view, it meant that the people who are running, and this included Steve Jobs too, who was our the chairman of the investor, was that we didn't pretend to be filmmakers, that you have filmmakers there and they have to make the decisions, but we also know those decisions are hard, they're tough. You essentially have to trust them because nothing works when you start, and if you don't do that, then they're not solving the problems. You don't want to become their problem, you want them to own the problem of making the film.</p>
</details>

您还谈到了分享正在进行中的工作的重要性，这对许多人来说相当困难。为什么？请告诉我们为什么分享工作很重要。我认为这在生活中和项目中都是如此：如果你正在承担任何重要的事情，那么它需要很多人参与，你必须把他们视为共同创作者。如果你要像对待共同创作者一样对待他们，那么他们就必须参与到问题中来。这意味着，既然你知道一开始会有问题，我甚至无法判断某件事是否好，因为它有问题。我唯一判断任何项目的标准是团队是否运作良好。如果他们运作良好，如果他们在一起欢笑、一起奋斗，那么他们更有可能解决问题。如果他们相处不好，或者领导者失去了对团队的信任，那么他们就不太可能解决问题。所以衡量标准是团队的健康状况，而不是项目是否顺利，因为项目本身就是问题。所以他们可能会挣扎，我不是在看他们是否挣扎，而是他们是否在一起工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You also talk about the importance of sharing work in progress, which is for many people quite difficult. Why, tell us why it's important to just share your work? I think this true with life in general and with with projects is that if you're taking on anything that's important, then it requires a lot of people, they're all participating in it, and you have to think of them as co-creators. And if you're going to treat them like co-creators, then they have to be engaged in the problems, which means that since you know you're going to have problems at the beginning, that I can't even judge whether or not something is good because it has problems. The only judge that I have of of had of of any project was whether or not the team was functioning well together. If they're functioning well, if they're laughing and they're struggling with each other, then they are much more likely to solve the problems. And if they're not getting along with each other, or they or the leader loses the trust in the people, then they're not likely to solve the problem. So the the measure is the health of the group, not not whether or not the project's working, because the project is the problem. So they may struggle, and I'm not looking at the fact that they're struggling, it's are they going are they working together?</p>
</details>

您还谈到了拆除天然障碍和“筒仓”的重要性。请告诉我这方面的情况。组织中自然的倾向是优化某些东西，使其在工作组中发挥作用。换句话说，即使他们不喜欢“筒仓”，人们也倾向于制造它们，这是组织中一种自然的倾向。所以如果你指出他们正在做一些他们实际上并不特别喜欢的事情，那么他们就更愿意打破这些障碍。这意味着要关注小细节。以皮克斯大楼为例，我相信这是我一生中工作过的最好的建筑。大楼的中央是一个开放空间，人们必须穿过它才能在大楼里走动。所以它被设计成将所有社区活动都集中在中心：我们的剧院（我们有三个剧院用来放映制作中的电影）、我们的用餐区、我们的会议室、我们的洗手间都设在中心。所以每个人都有理由穿过那里。这只是关注这些细节，从而促成了不经意的相遇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You also talk about the the importance of dismantling natural barriers and and silos and so on. Tell me about that. Well, the natural tendency in organizations is to optimize something and make it work work group. In other words, even though they don't like silos, people tend to make them just a natural tendency in organizations. And so if you point this out that they're doing something that they don't actually particularly like, then they're more open to sort of breaking down those doors, and what it means is paying attention to little details. In the case of the Pixar building, which I believe is the best building I've ever worked in in my life, was the middle of the building was an open space where people crossed and had to cross to get around the building. So it was designed to have all the the community things at the center. Our theaters, we had three theaters to show films in process, our eating area, our meeting rooms, our bathrooms were all at the center, so everybody had a reason to cross. It's just paying attention to those kinds of details.</p>
</details>

您还喜欢这座建筑的哪些方面？装饰很简洁，但同时所有的墙壁，比如动画师房间的墙壁都漆成了白色，原因是为了鼓励和允许他们随意改造这些房间。他们做了一些奇怪的事情，有些人甚至在墙上挖洞，而设施部门也支持这样做。所以没有人会说“别碰这个”或“别画这个”，而是说“尽情发挥吧”。他们确实做了一些最奇怪的事情，这让建筑有了一种有机感，但这种有机感是指在空间中工作的人是做出改变的人。没有任何设施团队会说“别那样做”，他们的工作就是“去做吧”，唯一的要求是“不要违反消防法规”。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Which caused inadvertent encounters to take place. What were some of the other things that you liked with the building? The decor was clean, but at the same time, all the walls, like the walls to the animators were painted white, and the reason they were painted white was they were encouraged and allowed to do whatever they wanted to these buildings, I mean to these rooms, and they just did strange things. Some of them cut holes in the walls, and facilities supported that, so nobody was saying don't touch this or don't paint this, I like knock yourself out, and they did, they did some of the strangest things, and it gave an organic feel to the building, but organic in the sense that the people working in the spaces were the ones who made the changes. There isn't any facilities group that's saying don't do that, their job is do that, and the only requirement is don't break fire code laws.</p>
</details>

### 史蒂夫·乔布斯的领导力演变

您提到了史蒂夫·乔布斯。当您将他与其他首席执行官进行比较时，是什么让他与众不同？在我与他共事的一生中，我为史蒂夫工作的时间比任何人都长。当我第一次认识他时，他就像那种被苹果公司开除的人，行为不端。所以我认识他时，他就是那样，这也是人们写书和拍电影的内容。但史蒂夫非常聪明，我看着他从错误中学习，他的人生经历了一个弧线。大概在1991年到1995年间，他发生了巨大的变化：他结婚了，他的儿子里德出生了，皮克斯制作了第一部电影并取得了成功。当皮克斯在95年上市时，那是他被苹果公司赶走后的第一次成功。在这个过程中，他变得富有同情心，在他改变之后，那些和他在一起的人在他余生都留在了他身边。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, you mentioned Steve Jobs. When you compare him with other CEOs, what sets him apart? What set him apart? Over the course of my life with him, and I worked for Steve longer than anybody else, when I first knew him, he was like that kind of person who got kicked out of Apple, and which was not a good behavior. So I knew him when he he was there, and that's what people write about and make the movies about. But Steve was so smart that I watched him learn from his mistakes, and he went through an arc in his life, and probably in the years of 1991 through 995, he dramatically changed. He got married, his son Reed was born, Pixar made its first film and was successful. When Pixar went public in '95, it was his first success since being forced out of Apple, and in the process, he became empathetic, and after he changed, the people who are with him stayed with him for the rest of his life. So that's sort of like the arc part of the story.</p>
</details>

但另一个方面是他的纯粹才华和对变化的理解。正如我所提到的，他从未告诉我们在皮克斯如何制作电影，也从未告诉我如何进行技术开发或使用什么电脑、什么软件。那是我的领域。他只是我们工作的一个坚定保护者，我们与苹果公司非常不同。但另一件我认为人们没有意识到的事情是史蒂夫与他周围人的关系。这就是关于史蒂夫的神话与现实不符的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the other one was the sheer brilliance and the understanding of change. So as I mentioned, he didn't tell us how to make the films at at Pixar, never did, nor did he ever tell me how to do technology or what computers to use, what software to use, so that was my domain. He was just a fierce protector of what we were doing, and we were very different than Apple. But the other thing which I don't think people realized was Steve relationship with the people around him. This is where the mythology about Steve actually isn't doesn't match up with the reality.</p>
</details>

举个例子，在皮克斯，我们是一家上市公司，持续了10年。在这10年里，史蒂夫解雇了两名董事会成员，原因是他认为他们从不反对他。他说，如果他们不反对我，他们就无法为公司带来任何价值。他的人更喜欢手机而不是iPad，他们提出了异议，并说服了史蒂夫。他们认为他总是做出正确的决定，但正确的决定是拥有那些会与你意见相左但又志同道合的强有力的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So as an example, at Pixar, we were a public company for 10 years. During that 10 years, Steve fired two members of the board of directors, and the reason he fired them was they never disagreed with him, and he said if they don't disagree with me, they're not bringing any value to the company. His people favored the phone over the iPad, and they disagreed, and they convinced Steve. They think, well, he was always making the right decision. The right decision was to have strong people who disagreed with you, but you all had a common interest in mind.</p>
</details>

埃德，拥有与您意见相左的人在您身边有多重要？嗯，这是我在皮克斯最令人欣慰的事情之一。当我参加会议时，我只是众多提出想法的人之一。我们会进行激烈的讨论，之所以令人欣慰，是因为即使我们没有解决问题，也没有达成一致，当我走出会议室时，我仍然觉得我们所有人都拥有这个问题。他们没有看着我说：“我们该怎么办？你是领导者，做出决定吧。”而是觉得我们都在一起。我们在一起很多年，因为事实上，我们感觉就像一个争吵不休的家庭，但一个团结在一起解决难题的家庭。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How important has it been for you, Ed, to have people around you who disagree with you? Well, it's one of the those things that has been emotionally one of the most gratifying things I had at Pixar was when I go into a meeting, then I was just one of the people throwing out ideas. We'd have these intense discussions, and the reason it was emotionally gratifying was even if we didn't solve the problem and we didn't agree, when I walked out of that meeting feeling like that all of us own the problem, they weren't looking at me and saying what should we do? You're the leader, make the decision. It's like we're all in this together. I mean, we were together for years and years and years because in fact, we felt like a like a say like a squabbling family, but a family was holding together on you know, solving difficult problems.</p>
</details>

创建这种家庭氛围和允许人们以建设性方式表达异议的关键是什么？我认为部分原因在于真诚地欣赏他人的贡献，并建立一个让每个人都这样做的环境，也就是说，他们都想听听别人怎么说。所以当我们建立“**智囊团**”（Brain Trust: 皮克斯内部的创意评审小组）时，人们觉得这很有趣，但智囊团有几个关键点。其中之一是智囊团实际上没有任何权力。请解释一下智囊团是什么。我们一开始就明白，你会在自己的项目中迷失方向，失去客观性。所以有一个外部力量非常重要，这个外部力量了解业务或项目，并且会质疑你正在做的事情，但同时他们对你的成功有着既得利益。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's the key to creating that kind of family and that kind of atmosphere where people can disagree in a constructive manner? Well, I think part of it is is genuinely appreciating the contributions of others and setting up an environment where they're all that way too, that is they want to hear what the others have to say. So when we set up our Brain Trust, which people find kind of interesting, but there are a few keys to the Brain Trust. One of them is the the Brain Trust actually doesn't have any authority. Explain what the Brain Trust is. We understood at the beginning that you get lost in your own project, you lose objectivity, so it's very important to have an outside force who is understands the business or the project and will question what you're doing, but at the same time, they have a vested interest in your succeeding.</p>
</details>

所以我们从最初的几部电影开始，迪士尼的汤姆·舒马赫就是那个外部力量。他会挑战我们正在做的事情。我们经常不同意，但这不重要，他就是那个外部力量，我们很欣赏他。但总有一天他会离开。他去了纽约迪士尼的剧院部门，我们将会失去这个外部力量。所以我们认为我们需要创建自己的外部力量，那就是这个由领导者组成的团队，他们可以挑战其他人的电影。好吧，这没有奏效。原因是我们都在同一栋大楼里，我们并不是真正的外部人员。但我们在这个过程中发现，它在发现问题方面非常有效。所以我们只是不断演进，找出如何做到这一点。我们很快意识到的一条规则是，这个团队不能推翻导演的决定。他们所做的只是提供反馈和意见。但通过消除房间里的权力，现在讨论的重点是项目本身。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we started with our first few films, there was a person down at Disney's Tom Schumacher, who was that outside force. He would just challenge what we were doing. We didn't often didn't agree, didn't matter, he was the outside force, but we appreciated it. But at some point, he was going to go, he went up to the theatrical in Disney back in New York, we were going to lose the outside force. So we thought we need to make our own outside force, which was this group of the leaders who could then challenge other people people's films. All right, that didn't work. The reason it didn't work was we're all in the building together, we're not really outside, but what we did find in the process of doing that, that it was remarkably effective at surfacing problems. So we just evolved to figure out how to do this, and one of the rules we realized right away was that this group couldn't override the director. All they were was giving feedback and notes, but by removing the power from the room, it was now about the discussion of the project itself.</p>
</details>

我在那里的角色实际上是观察房间里的动态。我的工作是：这个团队运作良好吗？他们彼此诚实吗？如果他们不诚实，为什么人们害怕说出自己的想法？他们是不是不想在别人面前表现得不好？他们是不是想给别人留下深刻印象？但所有这些都是人类的反应，它们可能会阻碍事情的进展。好吧，那它们是什么？我们如何解决它们？最终我们有了一个总体上非常高效的团队，他们专注于问题，给出意见，然后继续前进。然后负责电影的团队稍后必须带着这些意见回去，思考它们的含义，并找出如何解决问题，但他们不必采纳所提供的解决方案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My role there was actually to look at the dynamics of the room. My job was is this group working well? Are they being honest with each other? And why if they aren't being honest? Why are people afraid to say what they think? Do they not want to look bad in front of others? Are they tried to impress each other? But there are all kinds of things that are human reactions that can get in the way. Okay, well, what are they and how do we address them? And we ended up with a a group that in general was extremely effective, focusing on the problem, giving their notes, and then moving on. Then the team that's over the film later has to go back with those notes and think about what they mean and and figure how to address the problems, but they don't have to take the solutions that were offered.</p>
</details>

您从不称任何事情为失败，您只是说它行不通。为什么？首先要注意的是，“失败”这个词真的很有分量，因为它有两个含义。其中一个是你搞砸了，你没有努力工作。你知道，在商业和政府中，失败被用作打击对手的武器。所以，失败本身实际上会带来非常负面的后果。但失败还有另一个含义，那就是我们都会失败，我们都会从中学习。但人们几乎不可能将失败的这两个含义分开。但如果你关注学习的部分，这正是我们真正想要关注的，那么它真正的含义是你尝试了一些东西，但它行不通。如果这是你的心态，那么你只是在说：“好吧，我们试试这个，那个行不通。”称之为失败并没有帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You never call anything a failure, you just say that it it doesn't work. How come? Well, one thing to not is the word failure is really loaded because it's got two meanings. One of them is that you screwed up, you didn't work hard, you know, can and in business and in government, failure is used as a bludgeon with which to beat opponents. So, there there's actually really negative consequences that can come with failure itself. But there's another meaning of failure, which is that we all fail, we all learn from it, but it's almost impossible for people to separate these two meanings of failure. But if you look at the learning part of it, which is what we're really trying to focus on here, what it really means is you tried something and it doesn't work, and if that's your mindset, then you're just saying, okay, let's try this, that didn't work, that calling a failure doesn't help.</p>
</details>

另一件事是，我们偶尔确实会遇到失败，比如有些事情真的搞砸了。但你把“失败”这个词留给真正的失败，而不是每个人都在尽力解决问题，他们不需要有人用它来打击他们。他们实际上需要信心，让他们可以尝试，而不会因此受到伤害。但是，如果你确实遇到了真正的失败，你是如何处理的呢？嗯，一个真正的失败，举个例子，就像我们尝试了又尝试去解决一个问题，比如我们在电影制作中遇到了领导力问题。好吧，人们对导演有问题，他们觉得导演不听取意见或不回应。换句话说，我们尽一切可能保护团队，但如果团队对领导者失去信心，那这就是一个问题。所以我们会尝试支持他们，我们会增加团队成员或做出一些改变，但最终如果行不通，我们就会替换电影的导演，而且我们确实替换过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other thing is that once in a while, we do have failures, like something is really got screwed up, but you reserve the word failure for a real failure, not for the fact that you're just everybody's trying to do their best to solve the problem, and they don't need somebody they're going to get bludgeoned with it, and they actually need the confidence that let's try this, and I'm not going to get damaged by it. But if you do have if you do have a proper failure, how did you how did you deal with it? Well, a a proper failure would be as an example, where after trying and trying to fix something, like we've got let's say a leadership problem on a film, all right, so people are having problem with a direct director, and they don't feel the director is listening or responding, and in other words, we do everything we can to protect the team, but if the team loses confidence in the leader, then that's a problem. So then we try to shore them up, we will add people to the team or make some changes, but in the end, if it can't work, then we will replace and have replaced the director on the film.</p>
</details>

事实是，当你让某人担任这个角色，并且你认为他们能做到时，你总是会冒风险。但你需要这样做，你需要新鲜的声音，你需要新的观点。但你也给了他们一个他们从未担任过的角色。有些人会胜任，有些人则不会。老实说，我无法提前判断，这意味着你偶尔需要介入，找出问题，或者任命一位新的领导者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The the truth is, when you put somebody in the role and you think they can do it, you are always taking a risk, but you need to do that, you need fresh voices, you need new viewpoints, but you're also giving them a role they've never had before. Some rise to it, some don't. Honestly, I can't tell ahead of time, which means every once in a while, you got to go in and and and figure out or or put a new leader in.</p>
</details>

在您的书中，您谈到了你们团队疯狂工作的时候，例如《玩具总动员2》，你们在创纪录的时间内完成了它。在那些压力巨大的时期，管理人员的关键是什么？关键在于每个人都真的希望它成功，他们对公司有既得利益。对我来说，最重要的事情之一是，这并不是我们这些领导者说这是一个疯狂的目标，而是我们有一个疯狂的问题需要解决，我们都需要齐心协力来解决这个问题。所以他们带着一种心态进来，而部分疯狂的工作是他们努力工作来解决问题。事实上，在那之后，那部电影确实相当疯狂，实际上是太疯狂了，因为它对人们的身体造成了很大的负担。但在那之后，有很多电影我们不得不设置限制，因为人们会过度工作，因为他们试图给人留下深刻印象，或者他们试图做超出电影需要的事情，这对他们或电影都不好。所以这是一个微妙的平衡，但我喜欢他们真的想做出伟大的作品，但我们是为了长远发展。所以这还有另一方面，那就是人们在不应该过度工作的时候过度工作。

<p class="english-text">In your book, you talk about periods where you you guys were just working insanely hard, and for instance, for Toy Story 2, you you finished that in record time. What's the kind of key to managing people during those super stressful times? Well, the key is that everybody really wants this to work, they have a vested interest in the company, and for me, it was one of the most important things is that it wasn't like we as the the leaders are saying this is the insane goal, it's like we've got an insane problem, we have to solve, and we all need to get together to solve this problem. So they come in with a a mindset, and part of the insane work was that they were working hard to solve the problem. In fact, after that one, that one was pretty insane, actually, it was too insane, because it was just physically hard on people, but there are a lot of films after that where we had to put of restrictions in place because people would overwork because they were trying to impress or they're trying to do more than was necessary for the film that wasn't good for them or good for the film, so that's a it was a tricky balance, but I like the fact they really wanted to do great work, but we were in this for the long haul, so there's another side to this, which is people overworking when they shouldn't be overworking.</p>

### 电影角色与讲故事的艺术

您创造了一些电影史上最令人难忘的角色。首先，您最喜欢的角色是什么？嗯，我不会说是某个角色。首先要注意的是，因为我在电影制作期间就在那里，所以我看待它们的方式与其他人不同。我无法成为客观的旁观者。所以这些电影中的每一部背后都有一个故事。对我来说，大概有四五部电影脱颖而出，不仅因为它们是电影，还因为它们背后的故事。当然，其中之一是《**料理鼠王**》（Ratatouille: 皮克斯动画电影），这是一个如此不可思议的故事。这也是一个最初的导演，一个可爱的人，他构思了这个想法，设计了角色，设计了场景，但他陷入了困境，我们不得不替换他。我们用布拉德·伯德替换了他，他基本上是一位才华横溢的编剧，他解决了电影的问题。所以如果你看最终的电影，它是最初构思的实现，这个构思来自别人，但如果没有布拉德的洞察力和他令人难以置信的对话感，它就不会成为一部伟大的电影，他把它提升到了一个完全不同的层次。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you have created some of the most memorable characters in the history of of film making. Well, first of all, what's the what is your favorite character? Well, I I would it's not so much a character. The first thing to note is that because I was there during the making the films, I don't see them in the same way that other people do. I can't I'm not the objective outsider. Um, so every one of these films has a story behind it. There are probably like four or five films which rise to the top for me, not only is films, but also the story behind them. So one of course is Ratatouille, which is such an an unlikely story. It's also one where the original director, who's a lovely man, he's the one that conceived the idea, he designed the characters, he designed the set, but he was stuck, and we had to replace him, and we replaced him with Brad Bird, who basically was a is a brilliant writer, and he solved the problem of of the movie. So if you look at the final movie, it's the realization of the original pitch, which came from somebody else, but it would not have been that great movie without this Insight that Brad had and his incredible sense of dialogue, and then it it took it to an utterly different level.</p>

讲好故事的关键是什么？嗯，讲故事通常来说，如果你想一想，就像你给孩子读一本书一样，重要的部分是你抱着孩子，给他们读书。这是一种个人联系。我们在生活中会看到各种各样的故事，有些写得很好，有些只是为了满足要求而敷衍了事。当你做播客时，你本质上是在讲述和聆听故事，故事是我们彼此交流最重要的东西之一。所以如果我们讲述一个故事，无论是书、电影还是百老汇戏剧，我们都真的想与人们交流。我知道有些故事只是为了提供信息，有些是为了娱乐，但最好的电影是那些能与人们产生共鸣的电影，让你走出影院时感觉很好，但也带走了一些你与之产生联系的东西。

<p class="english-text">What is the key to good storytelling? Well, um, the storytelling in in general, if you think about it, like if you read a book to a child, what's the important part is you're holding the child in your lap and you're reading to them. It's it's a personal connection, and we we see stories throughout our life, some are well written, some are just you know, locked off, filling a requirement. When you're doing podcasts, you're essentially telling and hearing stories, and stories are one of the most important things we have to communicate with each other. So if we're telling a story, or books, or movies, or Broadway plays, is we really want to communicate with people. Now, I know some stories are just to inform, some are to entertain, but the best movies are the ones which connect to people, that you walk out, you will had a good experience, but you also walk walk away with something that you've connected with.</p>
</details>

创造这种联系的关键是什么？我相信，这是由一两个人领导的，比如导演和编剧，他们有一个想要实现的概念。但你让其他人参与进来的原因是，你想要吸取其他人的经验，你想要周围的人讲述他们自己的生活故事，或者他们自己的经历，或者他们看到的事情。收集这些东西会带来丰富的内涵，然后找出：“好吧，什么能让它独一无二？”但好的讲故事和好的电影制作也需要引人入胜。所以必须关注娱乐性，既然我们制作的是家庭电影，就必须有一些幽默感，这能让人们长时间地投入其中，因为你希望所有年龄段的人都能观看。你将冒险、幽默、外观、灯光——所有这些元素结合在一起，这些都是优秀电影制作的一部分，它们能在一个半小时内传达一些想法。

<details>

<p class="english-text">What's the key to create that connection? Well, I believe that um it's you know, a couple of people who are leading this, like the director and the writer, who have got a concept that they want, but the the reason you have other people involved in it is you want to have the experiences from other people, you want other people around there telling stories from their own lives or their own experiences or things they see, and there's a richness with gathering each of these and then figuring out, okay, what is it that's going to make this unique? But good storytelling also and good movie making requires that it also be engaging, so one does have to pay attention to the entertainment, and since we have family films, there's got to be some humor involved with it that holds people long because you want to have all ages, you're combining the adventure, the humor, the looks, the appearance, the lightings, the lighting, all of these elements which are part of good movie making, something which conveys you know you a few ideas into an hour and a half.</p>

当您开发角色时，开发令人难忘的角色的关键是什么？我们有角色设计师，他们试图让角色具有吸引力，即使是反派也应该在视觉上具有吸引力。所以这是一个层面的角色，另一个是他们如何被动画化。你看着动画，会说：“嗯，他们只是在四处移动。”但动画师拥有令人难以置信的视觉感，也就是说，他们看到了我们大多数人没有在意识层面看到的东西，比如我们的眼睛看向哪里，我们脸上的抽搐，我们的肢体语言。这是我们确实能看到的东西，即使我们没有有意识地意识到它，我们仍然在潜意识中解读肢体语言正在发生什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when you develop characters, what is the key to developing memorable characters? Well, we have character designers, who are trying to make the characters appealing, even the villains are meant to be appealing just at a at a visual sense, so that's one level of the character, and the other is how they're animated. You look at the at the animation and and say, well, they're just moving around, but the animators have got incredible senses of vision, that is they're seeing things that most of us don't see at a conscious level, like where our eyes look, the twitches on our face, our body language, is something that we do see even if we're not aware of it, consciously aware of it, we're still subconsciously reading what's going on with body language.</p>
</details>

一个好的动画师确实能看到并将其融入角色中。我举一个《玩具总动员2》中的例子，其中女孩杰西在讲述她的生活，但她正在扭动她的辫子。几乎没有人会刻意记住她在扭动头发，但当你看到时，你知道那是她焦虑的迹象。这就是动画师所做的，他们从不同的层面捕捉事物。所以一部电影有三个不同的交流层面：肢体语言、实际的动画本身（也就是动作），以及他们所说的台词。有趣的是，当这些不同的层面相互矛盾时。如果你说你很高兴，但你的身体动作却表明你很紧张或害怕，那么你的大脑就会捕捉到这一点，并说：“好吧，现在这很有趣，因为他们说的与他们做的并不匹配。”但这在生活中也是如此，就像解读肢体语言一样：“好吧，我能看出他们说的并不是他们真正的意思。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And a good animator does see that and puts that into the character. I give an example this back from Toy Story 2, where the girl Jesse is talking about her life, but she's taking the braid and she's twisting it. Almost nobody consciously remembers that she was twisting her hair, but when you see that, you know, know that that's a sign of her anxiety. That's what what what animators do is to see things that are catches at a different level. So at a movie, you've got like three different levels of communicating, you've got the body language, you've got the actual animation itself, you know, the motion, and then you got the words that they say, and what it's interesting when those different levels are actually at odds with each other. If you say that you're happy, but you're doing physical actions with your body, which says you're nervous or you're afraid, then your brain picks up and say, okay, now it's interesting because what they're saying doesn't match what they're doing, but that's true in life, it's like let reading body languages is like, okay, I can tell that what they're saying is not what they really mean.</p>

### 培养人才与拥抱谦逊

在创意组织中，培养人才的最佳方式是什么？我们公布了我们所做的一切。我们有一些竞争对手没有这样做，因为他们认为他们想要保守秘密，而我们的观点是，我们希望参与社区。这并不是因为我们是开源的虔诚信徒，而是因为这完全是一场人才之争。如果你参与其中，并且你是人们想去的地方，那么你就会吸引最优秀的人才。所以我们去了卢卡斯影业，情况也是一样。乔治·卢卡斯完全支持我们公布一切，我们吸引了更多优秀人才。然后史蒂夫·乔布斯加入了。史蒂夫以保守秘密而闻名，但他从未质疑我公布一切的决定，因为他明白我们所做的一切都是为了吸引优秀人才。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why what's the best way to develop talent in a creative organization? We published everything we did. We had some competitors who didn't because they thought they wanted secrets, and our view was we want to participate in the community, and it wasn't because we were you know, religious believers in open source, it was because it's all a talent play. If you participate and you are the place that people want to go to, then you bring in the best talent. So we went to Lucasfilm, and it was the same thing. George completely supported the fact that we wanted to publish everything, and we brought in even more great talent. And then Steve Jobs came in. Steve is known for being secretive, but he never questioned my decision to publish everything because he understood that everything we did was about bringing good talent.</p>
</details>

然后我们达到了一个点，我们引进了约翰·拉塞特，约翰明白这一切都是为了吸引人才。所以他最初雇佣的两个人是皮特·多克特和安德鲁·斯坦顿，他们都非常有才华。所以本质上，你有两组人，他们都以“这一切都是为了吸引优秀人才”为出发点，我们需要引进非常优秀的人才。当你做得好时，你更有可能吸引优秀的人。但这意味着你必须对引进新人持开放态度。我只是喜欢您如何利用开放和透明来吸引人才，以及这比保守秘密更重要。你知道，我真的相信同样的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, then we reached the point where we brought in John, and John understood that this was all about getting talent, so his first two hires were Pete Docter and Andrew Stanton, who were incredibly talented. So essentially, you've got two groups who start off with the notion of this all about getting good talents, we need to bring in extraordinarily good people. Now, when you're doing good work, then you're more likely to attract good people, but it means you have to be open to bringing in new people. I just love how you used openness and transparency to attract talent, and and how that is more important than keeping secrets, you know, I'm I'm just a really believer in the same thing.</p>
</details>

您有时会说，聪明人比小玩意更重要。您这是什么意思？我的意思是，首先要承认我自己的局限性。我早就知道我大约一半的决定是错误的，一半是好的，我实际上没有办法衡量这一点。但我认为重要的是要明白我们犯错的次数比我们想象的要多。好吧，如果你经常犯错，那么你如何才能达到一个好的境地呢？嗯，你引进那些你知道你不知道的事情的人。这意味着如果你选择人，而你甚至无法判断他们是否能带来价值，你看，你正在衡量他们的道德、他们的工作，但你也在冒风险。但如果你以这种方式处理，成功率实际上非常高。所以那些能胜任的人数，我总是发现非常多。他们中的大多数都非常想成功，他们并非都成功，但大多数都成功了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You say sometimes say smart people are more important than gadgets. What do you mean by that? I mean, the first thing is just to to acknowledge my own limits. I learned early on about half of my decisions were a crock, half were good, and I don't actually have a way of measuring that, but I think it's important to understand that we are wrong more than we think we are, and okay, if you're wrong a lot, then how do you get to good place? Well, you bring in people who know things that you don't know, which means if you're picking people and you can't even judge whether or not they bring value, see, you're you're measuring their ethics, their work, but you're also taking a risk, but the success rate if you approach it this way is actually really high. So the number of people who rise the occasion, I've always found is very good. These have to be trusted, most of them really want to succeed, they don't all succeed, but most do.</p>
</details>

所以，如果他们很聪明，我指的是一个相当普遍的意义，比如他们非常有才华，你正在寻找潜力，你根据潜力而不是他们是否达到了某个水平来招聘。水平思维是他们已经达到了标准，他们可以胜任这份工作。不，关键是潜力是什么，因为潜力很好，他们实际上会很快赶上工作所需的能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, if they're smart, and I'm referring to that in a fairly general sense, like they're just really talented, and you're looking for the potential, and you hire based upon potential, not upon whether or not they reached a certain level. Think you know, level thinking is they've crossed the bar, they can do the job. No, it it's what is the potential because the potential is good, actually, they'll catch up to what they need for the job very quickly.</p>
</details>

您如何筛选潜力？以皮克斯为例，在我们的第二部电影《**虫虫危机**》（A Bug's Life: 皮克斯动画电影）中，电影的领导者雇佣了能胜任工作的人。那部电影的招聘失败率比任何其他电影都高，因为他们的标准是“他们能胜任这份工作吗？”所以我经常和他们谈论这个问题，那就是你知道，你要根据潜力来招聘。现在问题是，你如何根据潜力来招聘？所以我说：“好吧，我们来制定一个实习生计划。”所以他们第一年招募了八名实习生，他们都很棒。其中八名中的七名毕业后回来加入了我们，他们现在还在那里，而且表现出色。但他们工作了，他们做了真正的工作，他们不是那种只是旁观的学员。所以他们回来后说：“好吧，我们给他们真正的项目。”所以他们回到学校后说：“我可以在电影制作中工作。”所以第二年有更多人申请。你知道，我上次查看时，大约有10,000份申请争夺最多100个职位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you screen for potential? In the case of of Pixar, for instance, the Bug's Life, our second film, the leaders of the film hired people who could do the job. We had more hiring failures from that film than any other because that that was their criterion, could they do the job? So I I talk with them a lot about it, is know you hire for potential. Now the question is, how do you hire for potential? So I said, well, let's put together an intern program. So they took eight interns the first year, and they were amazing. Seven of those eight after they graduated came back and joined us, they're they're still there, and they're they're phenomenal. But they worked, they did real work, they weren't trainees in the sense they're watching as they came and so, well, let's give them real projects. So they went back to school and said, I get to work on a movie. So the next year, more people applied, and you know, I lost time, I checked there were like 10,000 applications for most 100 positions.</p>
</details>

所以从一开始，你就在招聘那些因为其他人得到了真正的工作并获得了良好体验而加入的人。所以现在你可以从相当优秀的人中进行选择，然后你观察他们，然后你看看他们是否能胜任。所以第一个筛选过程实际上非常容易，因为我们在这方面开了一个好头。这就是为什么我喜欢研究生和暑期实习项目，因为你只是看到了那些拥有巨大潜力和能力的人，他们只是交付了你从未想过可能的事情。我的意思是，你说得对，这很棒。我不知道为什么人们会抵制它，但这是一个观察和发现人才的绝佳方式。正如你所指出的，他们只是为任何组织带来了新的和新鲜的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So right to begin with, you're hiring people who come in as a result of other people having been given real work and having had a good experience, so now you can select from pretty good people, and then you You observe them, and then you see whether or not they work. So the first filtering process actually is is pretty easy because we got off I think to a good start on that. It's why I love you know, graduate and summer intern programs because you just you just see people who got tremendous possibilities and you know, abilities, and they just deliver things that you never thought was possible. I mean, you're right, that's it's um I don't know why people resist resistant to it, but it's an awesome way to look at people and find people incredible, and as you and as you point out, they just bring something new and fresh to any organization.</p>
</details>

您是我们播客中最谦逊的人。您一直都这么谦逊吗？我不知道答案。实际上，我很容易被吓倒，但即使我被有权势的人吓倒，这从未影响我判断某件事是对是错。在创意产业中，你需要谦逊才能成功吗？我认为理解这一点非常重要，而且我认为我一开始就理解了，那就是我确实经常犯错。我认为如果你能理解你犯错的次数比你想象的要多，并且你需要其他人，那么你就会处于一个更好的位置。如果你成功了，这并不意味着你做出了所有正确的决定，而是因为有很多人在那里努力工作。坦率地说，我见过一些人认为成功是他们自己做到的，你知道，这是一种消极的，是一种毒药，认为你的成功是因为你自己做到的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you are the the most humble person we ever had on this podcast. Have you always been this humble? I I don't I don't know the answer to that actually. I was easily intimidated, but even though I was intimidated by people in authority and EMP power, it never affected whether or not I thought something was right or wrong. Do you need to be humble to be successful in Creative Industries? I think it's very important to understand, and I think I did understand to begin with, is that I really am wrong a lot of the time, and I think if you sort of understand that you're wrong more than you think you are, and that you need other people, that you're in a better place, and if you're successful, it doesn't mean it's because you made all these right decisions, it's because there are a lot of people who were there making this work. You know, I frankly, I have seen people who think that it was them who did it, and it's you know, it's a it's a negative, it's a poison in the body to think that your success is because you did it yourself.</p>

### AI对动画的未来影响与核心价值观

您认为人工智能将如何改变动画？在我的一生中发生的一件事是，虽然**摩尔定律**（Moore's Law: 集成电路中晶体管数量每两年翻一番的观察）是一个重要的关键指标，但更重要的数字是性能/价格的复合年改进率。60年来，年复合增长率一直是每年40%。这令人震惊，而且还在继续，尽管摩尔定律已经基本趋于平稳。实际增长率甚至有所提高，因为随着**GPU**（Graphics Processing Unit: 图形处理器）等技术的使用，计算量令人难以置信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you think AI will change animation? The one thing that that's happened over the course of my life is that while Moore's law has been a great key indicator, the the the more important number is the the compound annual improvement of performance per price. So for 60 years, years, the annual compound rate has been 40% per year. All right, that's mindblowing, all right, and that's continuing even though Moore's law has essentially tailed off. And the actual rate is increased because with the use of of GPUs and so forth, the amount of computing is incredible.</p>
</details>

如果你看看过去10年，全球的总计算量增加了100万倍。在接下来的10年里，它还将增加100万倍。在接下来的10年里，你的便携设备或台式机中可用的计算量将增加40到100倍。所以当你看到这个速率时，这正是我们所经历的，对我来说，是过去50年，它将极大地改变事物，无论是好是坏。所以答案是，它会影响动画吗？绝对会。它也高度不可预测。所以这一直是整个过程的趋势，它会改变事物吗？绝对会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, if you look at the last 10 years, the aggregate computing in the world has increased increas by a factor of 1 million in 10 years, and in the next 10 years, it's going to increase by 1 million. The the amount of computing available in a either your portable device or your desktop will increase by a factor of 40 to 100 in the next 10 years. So when you look at that rate, which is kind of what we've lived through, you know, for me, it's been the the last 50 years, is it's going to change things dramatically for for good or for bad. So the answer is, will it affect animation? Absolutely. It's also highly unpredictable. So that's that's also been the course all along, is that is it going to change things? Absolutely.</p>
</details>

当互联网出现时，你可以看到它将改变一切，它将使信息民主化，它也使虚假信息民主化。毫无疑问，我们将经历巨大的变化，只是它非常不可预测。我认为对于这样的事情，我们的价值观很重要，我们如何对待他人很重要，而这些不仅仅是关于技术，而是关于我们的人性以及我们与人合作的方式，这些都将是至关重要的，就像它们一直以来一样。有些人擅长，有些人则不关心。

<p class="english-text">When the internet came along, you could see was going to change everything, was going to democratize information, it also democratized disinformation. We are going to go through dramatic changes without a doubt, it's just that it's pretty unpredictable, and I think that with something like this, our values matter, how we treat people matter, and those other things which just what which aren't just about the technology, but they're about our humanity and the way we work with people are going to be crucial as they've always been. Some people are good at it, and some don't care.</p>

### 给年轻人的建议

谈到人性并关注其他事物，您会不时地进行静默冥想。它们是关于什么的？嗯，我上周就进行了一次。当我这样做时，有点吓人，因为大脑中总是喋喋不休、说话的那一部分，我一直以为那就是我，但实际上，当它慢下来或停止时，我才意识到那不是真的。它只是我拥有的一个工具。但当我慢下来时，那是一个更平静的地方。所以我做了两次，每次持续一个月，有些人会做很长时间。这是一种很难描述的状态，很多人害怕安静的概念。所以部分原因是为了意识到：“哦，没什么好害怕的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Talking about humanity and focusing in on other things, you go on silent retreats from time to time. What are they about? Well, I was on one last week. When I did this, it was kind of scary because the that part of the brain which is always chattering and talking, I always thought was me, and it was it was actually in in slowing that down or stopping it to realize it isn't true. It's it's a tool I have, but when I slow that down, I it's a a calmer place to be. So I've done two of them that have lasted for a month, and some people do it for a very long period of time, and it's a hard to describe state. A lot of people are afraid of the concept of being quiet, and so part of it is to realize, oh, there's nothing to be afraid of.</p>
</details>

当您结束一个月的静默后，您感觉如何？那是一种平静。我通常有一些需要回去做的事情，但我可以更平静地去处理。我们的播客有很多年轻人收听。您对年轻人有什么建议？您有78年的经验，如果将这些经验浓缩成几条建议给年轻人，您会说什么？我最近关注的一件事是，有些人想快速致富，而我认识的大多数人，这并不是他们的目标。他们的目标实际上是拥有一个个人目标，一个让他们感觉良好的目标，这与财富或任何类似的东西无关。他们想为世界做出贡献，我认识很多人都是这样。他们想解决当今世界面临的一些严重问题。我们知道我们面临着非常严重的，甚至是极其严重的环境问题，以及我们新技术（如人工智能）带来的未知后果。我们可以看到它们的积极面，这将会发生，但我们不完全了解它们的负面影响。

<p class="english-text">What do you feel like when you come out of a month of silence? He's it's a a calm that's I I typically have things I need to return to do, but I can go out it with more equinity. We have a lot of young people on this listening to this podcast. What is your advice to young people? You have 78 years of experience. If you were to synthesize this down to a few pieces of advice for young people, the one thing I've paid attention to recently is that some people want to get rich quick, and for most people I've know who done just it wasn't their goal. It was actually to have a personal goal, which is one they feel good about, it has nothing to do with wealth or anything like that. It's like I want to make a contribution to the world, and I know a lot who are that way. They want to address some of the serious problems of the world today, and we know that we've got very serious, like extremely serious environmental problems that are coming. We've got unknown consequences of our newer technologies with AI. We can see the upside for them, which is is going to happen. We don't fully know the downside.</p>
</details>

那么，人们必须为这些即将到来的变化带来什么样的伦理或价值观呢？对于年轻人来说，他们正在进入一个充满重大变化的时代。所以这是一个机会，但在这样一个充满剧烈变化的机会中，要确保你在做事情的同时坚守一些核心价值观，思考什么是价值观，你想做什么，你不想做什么，以及你如何避免迷失。另一个是重视他人的才能，因为你正在进入一个有许多才华横溢的人的空间，但你也有同事。你如何与他人建立关系？我成长起来的社区之一实际上不是娱乐社区，而是**SIGGRAPH**（Special Interest Group on Graphics and Interactive Techniques: 计算机图形学和交互技术特别兴趣小组）社区，这是一个开发计算机图形学的团体，它产生了深远的影响。他们是我的朋友，之所以成为朋友，是因为当我年轻时，我与其他人一起解决其他问题，你知道，我们一生都保持着朋友关系。我将这一点传达给年轻人，因为我不知道会发生什么。你甚至无法重复我所做的事情，你无法重复过去。所以你从中学习，你观察，但你带走的是：“好吧，我们如何应对即将到来的变化？我们想要解决哪些有意义的挑战？”

<p class="english-text">And so what are the the the ethics or the values that people have to bring to these changes, which are coming? For those who are young, they're entering into a a time of significant change, so it's an opportunity, but in that opportunity, which is one of dramatic change, is to make sure you hold on to some core values while you do it, to think about what are values and what do you want to do and what do you not want to do, and how do you keep from getting lost? And the other is to value other people's talent because you are entering into a space where there other people who are very talented, but you also have colleagues with you. How do you establish relations with others? And it was one of the my community that I was growing up with actually is not the entertainment community, it's the the SIGGRAPH community, which is the group that developed computer graphics, which had such a profound impact. Those are my friends, and they're friends because when I was young, I joined with other people to solve other problems, and you know, we remained friends who participated my entire life. I value that to younger people because I don't know what's going to happen. You can't even repeat what I did, you can't repeat the past, so you you learn from it, you observe, but what you take away is, okay, how do we approach the coming changes, and what are the challenges that are meaningful that we want to work on?</p>
