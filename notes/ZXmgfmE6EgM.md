### 奇华顿简介与使命

**Nicolola Tangen**: 大家好，我是挪威主权财富基金的首席执行官**Nicolola Tangen**。今天我在瑞士，与一位非常棒的伙伴在一起，因为我来到了**奇华顿 (Givaudan)**，这家公司是全球香精、香料和气味的领导者，所有这些美妙的事物都围绕着我们。我身旁的是**Gilles Andrier**，他担任首席执行官已有20年。热烈欢迎。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Hi everyone. I'm Nicolola Tangen, the CEO of the Norwegian So Wealth Fund. And today I'm in Switzerland and in really really good company because I am at Jivoda, the world leader in flavors and tastes and smells and all these fantastic things which surround us. And I'm here with Jilan who has been the CEO for 20 years. And warm welcome.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 谢谢，也热烈欢迎来到瑞士，来到**奇华顿**，来到坎顿。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Thank you and warm welcome to Switzerland and to Jivon and here in Kent.
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 太棒了。来到你们的研发中心，这个世界气味和味觉的中心，真是不可思议。那么，我们开始吧。简而言之，**奇华顿**是什么？他们做什么？你们做什么？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Wonderful. And it's kind of incredible to be here at your R&D center, the center of the world's smell and taste. So, let's kick off. What is what is Jiva in brief? What do they do? What do you do?
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 嗯，我可以用不同的方式来看待它。我们让世界闻起来和尝起来都很好。但我们实际上在不久前认真思考了我们的宗旨，我们希望将业务扩展到香水和风味领域之外。所以，我们表达我们所做和应该做的事情的方式是让消费者更快乐、更健康，这让我们对除了味觉和嗅觉之外，还能为他们做什么有了更广阔的视角。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Um I can see it in different ways. We make the world taste and smell very good. But we actually we we we really thought about our our purpose a little while ago and we wanted to expand beyond just the world of fragrances and flavors. So the way we express what we do and what we are meant to do is to make consumers happier and healthier which gives us a broader perspective on what we could do for them beyond the taste and smell.
</details>

### 嗅觉与味觉的重要性

**Nicolola Tangen**: 为什么嗅觉和味觉在连接人方面如此重要？因为我们首先是动物。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Why is smell and taste so important in connecting people? because we are animals in the first place.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 完全正确。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Totally.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 是的，你知道，对我来说一直很有趣的一点是，即使担任首席执行官21年，在**奇华顿**工作了32年，我仍然对这个行业的魔力感到惊叹。首先，举个例子，在你的身体里，在我们的身体里，我们有2000个受体。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Yeah. You know, just something which is interesting which is for me always, you know, even after 21 years as CEO, 32 years at Jivido, I'm still amazed by how you know, this business is magic. So in the first place, for example, you know, in your body, in our bodies, we have 2,000 receptors
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 实际上有500个，也就是四分之一，专门用于味觉和嗅觉。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: and you actually have 500, so a quarter of them which are only dedicated to taste and smell.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 所以它首先是生存工具包。是的，它是为了拥有愉快的生活，闻到美好的事物等等，但首先它基本上是一个生存工具。它关乎，你知道，苦味是毒药，恶臭对你不好，但同时甜味是卡路里，对你更好。它关乎能量。所以所有这些东西显然是消费者的核心，而且我们显然在处理记忆，因为身体的设计方式使其与情感、记忆有着如此紧密的联系，而且它是从感官到记忆最快的方式，这就是为什么这些事物如此紧密相连。这就是我们业务的美妙之处，也是我们工作的基石。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: So it's basically the surviving kit in the first place. Yes, it's to have a pleasant life to you know smell beautiful things and so forth but in the first place it has basically where it's a survival kilt. It's about you know bitterness is poison foul is not good for you but at the same time sweet is is calories is better for you. It's about energy. So it's all those things that obviously is at the core of consumers and obviously we are dealing with memories because the the the body is designed in such a way that actually it has such a connection with the emotions with the memories and it's actually the fastest way to go from the senses to the memory and that's why those things are being so linked. So that's the beauty of our business and that's the cornerstone of what we of what we do.
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 嗯，你们做了很多事情，有很多方法可以深入了解这一点，但我很想从你们开发和使用气味的创意过程开始。首先，你们为谁创造？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: M m well you do many things and there many ways to kind of get into this but I just love to kick off with the creative process when you develop and use smell um who well first of all who do you who do you create it for
</details>

### 香水创意开发流程

**Gilles Andrier**: 所以我们是B2B业务。显然，**奇华顿**本身不是一个品牌，你不会在货架上找到**奇华顿**的产品，因为味觉和嗅觉实际上是消费者想要回购产品时的关键差异化属性。任何产品，它都排在包装、广告、价格或产品功能性之前。这不是我们说的，而是我们的客户说的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: So we are in a B2B business obviously Jivon is not a brand in itself where you will find Jivodon on the shelf because taste and smell is actually the key differentiating attribute when a consumer wants to repurchase a product any product it comes at the top of the list before packaging advertising pricing whatever the functionality of a product it's not us saying that it's our own clients
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 那么，假设我现在是**Tom Ford**，我来找你们，想创造一款新香水，我们该如何着手？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: so let's say now I'm Tom Ford I come to you I want to create a new perfume what do we how do we attack this
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 基本上，这就是所谓的“提案”。你会发布一个提案，你是**Tom Ford**的**产品经理**或**市场总监**，你会发布一个提案，并向我们以及其他香水公司提交提案，因为这是一个竞争性的提案，你希望从众多调香师的创意中获得最佳方案。这就是你们的运作方式。我们实际上可能会一起定义提案，因为我们可能会帮助你定义提案，例如目标消费者类型，它如何与你在**Tom Ford**品牌下的其他香水进行定位，你可能有一些想法。所以，我们通过提案一起进入一个共同开发过程。然后我们有200名调香师遍布全球，我们不会让200名调香师都参与**Tom Ford**的提案，但我们会让纽约、巴黎，也许还有其他地方的顶尖调香师参与。我们会创造一些想法，这就像一个漏斗，**Tom Ford**的团队会进行筛选和淘汰。他们也会与其他香水公司这样做，在某个时候，我们会找到几个方向，然后我们会一起进行消费者测试等等。这可能需要三周，如果客户很小，也可能需要两三年，这可能需要很长时间，最终优胜者胜出。但是当你说方向时，那是什么意思？我的意思是，我现在有现有的香水。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: So basically that's what's called a brief so you're going to issue a brief you are the product manager the the marketing director of Tom Ford at the Celodo and you're going to issue a brief and you're going to brief us but alongside other fragrance houses because it's a competitive brief and you want to get the best out of the creativity of a broad range of perfumers. So that's how you go about it. We might actually define the brief together because I might you know we might help you in defining the brief what type of consumers how does it position itself with the other you know perfumes that you have under the Tom Ford area you might have some ideas so it's really we enter a co-development process together through the brief and then we have so we have 200 perfumers around the world we're not going to have 200 perfumers working on the top four brief But we are going to have the fine finance perfumemers out of the New York, out of Paris, out of you know maybe some other places and we're going to create some ideas and it's going to be like a funnel with the team of Tom for to actually select eliminate and they're going to do that with the other fragrance houses and at some point we're going to find a few leads which with on which we're going to work together make some consumer test and so forth. And then that can take three weeks with a very small client two three years it can take a long time and the best the best wins but when you say lead what is that I mean so now I have my existing fragrances
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 那么它们会是哪种方向呢？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: and then what type of leads would they be
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 所以你可能在**Tom Ford**系列中已经有一些非常木质或果香的香水。我们可能会带着一些想法来找你，以填补某个空白，或者提供一些能与你现有香水系列相符，同时也能呼应**Tom Ford**品牌特性的东西。因为这个行业的美妙之处在于，任何品牌几乎都有一个嗅觉签名，它闻起来像**Tom Ford**，闻起来像**Gucci**。所以它需要基本符合产品组合中的战略，也要符合品牌的签名，这就是我们共同完成的工作。所以你可能会有，这真的取决于我们调香师的创造力，他们既能凭空想出新点子，也能更理性地思考这如何融入现有系列。所以，实际上，我们经常被投资者等归类为化工行业。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: So you might have a range already in the top four the you know which are very sort of woody or or some of the fruity or some of the and it might be interesting and that's going to be us coming to you with some ideas to fit maybe a gap or something that you know essentially is going to fit the the range of perfumes that you already have but which also needs to echo to what Tom Ford is as a brand you know because the beauty of this business is that any brand has almost like an alactive signature it smells like Tom it smells like Gucci so it needs to fit basically the strate strategic you know some some form of strategy in the portfolio but also to fit the signature of the of the brand and that's what we do together. So you might have and that's really based on the creativity of our perfumers finding ideas out of the blue as much as you know being a bit more rational in terms of of how does this fit in the in the range of the so that's there is actually you know very often we are we are fit by investors and so forth into the chemical industry
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 我们可以想象，我们与化工行业相距甚远，我们实际上更接近广告行业，尤其是在谈到高级香水时，它关乎定义品牌，定义品牌的属性，然后将其转化为信息以及如何传播。所以这个过程有点相似。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: we are as far as the chemical industry as you can imagine we actually closer to especially when we talk about fine factor also the advertising industry where it's all about defining the brand, defining the attributes of the brand and then translating that into a message and how you going to communicate about it. So it's a bit the same process.
</details>

### 香水市场趋势与创新

**Nicolola Tangen**: 气味如何融入时尚？时尚潮流和气味是如何运作的？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: How does smell fit into fashion? How how do the fashion waves and smell how does it work?
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 所以显然有趋势。例如，在过去的10年里，出现了一个巨大的**美食调**趋势。你知道，它关乎美食调的签名等等。你可能想抓住一些趋势，或者例如今天非常有趣的是，我们的高级香水业务在过去五年里一直蓬勃发展，实现了两位数的增长，这在很大程度上是由**Z世代**和**Alpha世代**推动的。突然之间，整个消费者群体发现通过**多层香水**来表达自己是如此令人兴奋。这真的是一种自我表达的方式。通过这种方式，很明显，因为这是一种表达方式，高级香水需要绽放并大量扩散，这与20、25年前可能不同，那时更多的是为自己使用香水。所以这些是随着消费者而演变的趋势，我们也会通过我们开发的新成分和新分子来创造一些趋势。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: So you have trends obviously you know for for example today you know over the last 10 years there's been an enormous trend around gourmand you know it's about um you know the gourman sort of signatures and so forth. you you might want obviously to jump onto the trend of some trends or for example today what's extremely interesting and and and you know our fine finance business has been booming for the last five years double digit it's been very much fueled by the Gen Z the genpha and know suddenly it's a whole cohort of consumers who found so exciting to actually express themselves with multi-layering fragrances and it's really a matter of expressing yourself And um through that you know it came out very clearly that because it's a matter of expression fine fragrances needed to bloom and to really diffuse very much so as compared maybe to 20 25 years ago where it was really about having fragrances for yourself and so forth. So those are trends which evolve with consumers and we also create some trends you know with with with newness with new ingredients that we develop. So
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 那么告诉我一些关于新事物的故事。什么是新事物？那么，在香水世界里，我应该穿什么才能显得现代？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: so tell me about something on new the new stuff. What's new stuff? So what should I wear to be modern in a fragrance world?
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 没有什么是唯一的，这真的就像时尚一样。你知道，时尚可以提供许多品牌。所以这真的取决于你对香水的感受。你知道，有如此多的香水家族，香水有无限的可能性，因此，这真的是关于探索，这真的是关于，这就是新消费者所做的。看到他们很有趣。他们会在实体店里度过周六下午，一起探索什么适合你。所以，这是一种表达方式。你喜欢什么音乐？我不能告诉你，你只能自己尝试。所以，在香水方面，有点像这样。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: There's not something it's it's really about well it's like in fashion you know you you there as many brands as fashion you know can can propose. So it's really about how you how you feel about the fragrance you know how you there are so many families there's an infinite possibility of fragrances and therefore it's it's really about exploring it's really about and that's what new consumers do. It's very interesting to see them. They spend their Saturday afternoons on in brick and shop, brick and mortar, you know, shops exploring together and what fits you. So, it's a matter of expression. What music do you like? I can't tell you just experiment. So, it's it's it's a bit like this in in fragrances.
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 好的。那么，假设我们已经有了提案。我们决定走柑橘路线。对吧。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Okay. So, say now we have had the brief. We decide that we want to go down the citrusy route. Right.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 没错。嗯，所以是清新感，带有柑橘前调，再配上木质琥珀调。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Exactly. Um, so the freshness with a citrus top note on top of a woody ambery note
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 就像**旷野香型**那种。那么我们该怎么做？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: like oavage type uh thing. So what do we
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 那么我们该怎么做？我们一起去实验室，你和我。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: So what do we do? So we go into the lab together, you and I. And
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 所以我们显然会去那里，然后呢？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: so we go obviously we we Yeah, we go there and then
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你们实验室里有什么？实验室是什么样的？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: what do you have what do you have in the lab? What does a lab look like?
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 所以核心是，你又回到了调香师，也就是那些“鼻子”。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: So you have at the core. So again you go back to the perfumemers. So the noses.
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Yeah.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 他们会写一个配方。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Uh you know they they're going to write a formula.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 是的。他们会表达，就像你会在电脑上写一首音乐一样，他们会写配方，他们知道配方闻起来是什么样子的，这也是一种魔力。你知道，这只是一种表达方式。显然，然后。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Yeah. They're going to express like you know you will write a piece of music on the computer they write the formula they know how the formula smells this is also a piece of magic you know they it's just a matter of expression obviously then
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 所以就像一个音乐家，他可以读懂音符，并在脑海中感受到它会是什么样子。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: so it's like a musician you can read the notes and feel in his head what it's going to look like
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 没错。但显然他们仍然需要闻到实际的味道，就像音乐家需要演奏音乐一样。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: exactly and then but obviously they needs to still smell the reality like a musician you need to play the music
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 所以你闻到了样品。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: so you smell the sample it's
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你们有样品吗？实验室里有很多不同的气味吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: where do you have the sample do you have you have lots of different smells in the in the lab
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 所以每个调香师都有一个技术员坐在20米外，旁边有一个由不同成分组成的“风琴”。这个成分调色板可以有500到2500种不同的成分。这些成分是配方的一部分。技术员制作配方，称量每一种成分，非常微小的滴剂，一些其他成分的量稍多一些，制作样品，与酒精混合，然后回到调香师那里。调香师闻一闻，放一个盘子，再闻一闻。然后调香师不是独自一人。她周围有人会帮助这个过程。**奇华顿**的人，你知道，他们被称为**评估师**。所以**评估师**的作用是连接调香师的工作与客户想要的东西，以及品牌在外部想要的东西，因为你也可能不是唯一一个参与这个提案的调香师。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: So you have for every perfume You have a technician sitting 20 m away with an organ of different ingredients. The pallet of ingredients which can be 500 to,500 different ingredients. And those ingredients are part of the formula. The technician makes the formula, weighs every single ingredient, very tiny drops, a bit more volume, some other ingredients, makes the sample, mix in the alcohol, go back to the perfumer. The perfumer smells, put a plate, smells, um, and then the the perfumer is not by himself or herself. She is surrounded with people who are going to help in the process. people at Jivodong, you know, so it's called evaluators. So the evaluators are there to actually bridge the work of the perfumemers with what the clients want, what the brand want on the outside because also you might not be the only perfumer working on this brief alge
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 这样我们就能最大限度地提高赢得提案的机会。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: so that we maximize the chances of winning the brief.
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你们有多少个评估师？所以在一个项目上，你们有一两个评估师，但在大型提案上，你们可能有两三个调香师在工作。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: How many evaluators do you have? So on a project you have one or two evaluators but you might have two or three perfumers working on big briefs.
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 所以他们竞争？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: So they compete
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 他们竞争，但那是。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: they compete but that's
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 是友好的竞争吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: it friendly competition or
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 这是一种非常友好的竞争，因为这是一种团队合作，最终每个人都希望自己的香水能赢，因为我们有激励计划。所以基本上，它的设计方式是，我们都有兴趣一起赢。显然，赢得比赛的调香师可能会比仅仅参与比赛的调香师更自豪，但是。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: it's a very friendly competition because it's a teamwork where every at the end of the day you have an interest into your perfume part to win because it's a it's it's we have incentive plans we have. So basically the way it's designed is that there is interest that we all win together. Obviously the perfumer wins might be a bit prouder than the one who has just participated in the race but
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 所以我们现在有了一瓶香水，里面的东西我们很喜欢，评估师也喜欢，接下来你们怎么做？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: so here we have so we now have a bottle the stuff in there we love it the evaluators like it what do you do then
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 那么显然，我们会回到客户那里。在法国有很多互动，所以客户会来办公室。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: so then obviously we go back to so the clan so they in France there's a lot of interaction so the clans comes to the office uh
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 我们一起闻这个想法，但我们也可能闻其他想法。然后，在客户方面，他们有非常擅长评估高级香水的人。它是否合适？他们感觉如何？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: we smell together we smell this this idea but we might might smell other ideas u and then in front of us. You know, at the client side, you have people who are very capable of evaluating the fine fragrance. How does it fit? How do they feel about it?
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 然后你可能会被选中进行测试，因为有些客户会测试香水，有些则完全凭自己的信念和直觉。但本质上，你可能会进入消费者测试。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Uh, and then you might be selected to go into tests because some clients test the fragrances, some others just go by their conviction and gut feeling. Uh but essentially you might go into a consumer test
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 因此，例如，我们会在不同国家向100名消费者展示香水，你会将这些想法与那些测试效果很好的基准进行比较。这是一种令人安心的方式，可以说这可能会成功。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: and therefore you know it's it's it's 100 for example consumers on which we're going to present the fragrances in different countries and you're going to test those ideas against benchmarks which are testing very well. So that's a comforting way of saying maybe that's going to be potentially a success. Mhm.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 这有一些局限性，因为你测试得越多，就越可能把自己锁定在消费者已经知道的东西上。大多数巨大的成功可能从未经过测试，因为实际上，创造出非常不同的东西的唯一方法是不要让消费者闻到他们习惯的东西。所以实际上，关于是否应该测试总是有争议的，但它可能是一个安慰因素。你可能会有一些测试效果不佳但最终会取得巨大成功的东西。所以有很多悖论，但那是。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: There is some limitations to that because the more you test, the more you're going to maybe lock yourself into something that consumers already know. Most of the big successes maybe were never tested because actually the only way to actually create something very different is not to have consumers smell things that they are used to. So actually um there is always a debate about should you test should you not test but it can be a um a comfort factor. You can have things which actually don't test very well but we are going to be huge successes. So you have a lot of paradoxes but that's
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 我们是否倾向于喜欢我们已经知道的东西？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: do we tend to like do we tend to like more the stuff we already know.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 没错。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Exactly. That's the
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 它的可预测性如何？所以现在我们有了一个产品，你们多久能真正预测一个产品的成功？嗯，尤其是在高级香水领域，你或多或少知道，如果测试结果真的很差，你知道它会失败，所以你最好不要推出它，但这并不是说你测试得很好就一定会取得巨大成功。因为还有其他因素，你知道，你需要有合适的包装、合适的组合、合适的广告。所以，嗯，所以有一定的可预测性，但是，你没有任何保证，就像任何事情一样，除了音乐。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: how predictable is it? So now we have something how how often are you really able to predict the success of a product? Well, that's the especially in fine fragrances that's that's you have a certain you know you know more or less you know if you have really poor test results you know it's going to be a flop so you better not launch it but it's not because you're testing very well that's going to be huge success. So because there are other elements you know you need to have the right packaging the right mix the right advertising. So um so there is a certain form of predictability uh but uh but you have no no assurance like in anything but music
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你知道，**红牛 (Red Bull)** 是有史以来测试结果最差的产品之一。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: you know one of the worst uh test results ever for a product was Red Bull.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 人们完全讨厌它。我的意思是它太糟糕了。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: People just totally hated it. I mean it was so awful
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 通常你会把它装在大瓶子里，免费出售。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: that normally you would have put it into huge bottles and sold it for nothing.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 相反，他们把它装在非常小的瓶子里，以高价出售，据说它是世界上第二畅销的饮料。对吧。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Instead they put it into very small bottles and sold it for a huge price and supposedly is the second bestselling beverage in the world. Right.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 所以你在行业中有这样的例子。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: So you have examples in the industry.
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 那么最大的惊喜是什么？对你来说最大的惊喜是什么？你认为什么不会畅销？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: So what's the biggest surprise? What's been the biggest surprise for you? That's something you didn't think was going to sell
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 很多年前我们做过一个商学院的案例。它叫做**Mugler**的**Angel**。那真的是非常非常具有颠覆性的。那是一款非常美食调的、扑面而来的、令人难以抗拒的香水。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: a business school one which we did many years back. It's called Angel by Muglair. Uh and that was really really really disruptive. That was a very gourman in your face overwhelming.
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 那么“美食调”是什么意思？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: So what does GMO mean? What does that mean?
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 美食调意味着它非常甜，像巧克力，非常可口。

**Gilles Andrier**: Gmon means it's a very sweety chocolate very edible.

**Gilles Andrier**: 通常，回到动物的故事，我们喜欢与食物相关的东西。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Usually again back to the animal story we like what is linked to food
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 在这种情况下，**Angel**相当两极分化。但当时的女性客户非常有信心，她们推出了这款香水，它被称为“慢热型产品”。所以实际上，它不一定一开始就成功，但随着时间的推移，它逐渐建立起来，并吸引了消费者。今天，我们在香水界称**Angel**为许多其他香水的“母亲”，这些香水都走向了美食调路线。所以，有时在高级香水领域，你需要冒险，需要有非常坚定的信念，才能创造出我们所说的**潮流引领者**。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: you know so in this case Angel was quite polarizing uh but the the woman at the time Vi you know had a huge conviction and they launched it and it's called what is called a slow builder. So actually you know it was not necessarily an initial success but over time it built up and it attracted consumers and today Angel we say in perfumery is the mother of many many many other fragrances which went into this gond root. So you need sometimes to take risks on on in in fine fragrances to have a very strong conviction to create what we call trends setters.
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 还有哪些“母亲”？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: What are some of the other mothers?
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 实际上，非常有趣的是，由于新成分、新分子的不断创造，丰富了我们刚才谈到的调色板，其中一些新分子就是在这个大楼里创造出来的。例如，**秋香木 (Akigalawood)** 就是几年前创造出来的，现在它已经成为许多高级香水成功的幕后推手，它本身就创造了一种趋势。所以你可以通过新成分和新分子来创造新趋势，以及新的“母亲”和“父亲”。这就是为什么拥有最优秀的人才、最优秀的调香师进行配方调配，同时辅以非常新颖的成分，这将有助于未来创造新的香水，这一点极其重要。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Actually what's very interesting is that because of new ingredients, new molecules which have been created in the meanwhile to enrich the palette that we just talked about and some of those new molecules are being created here in this building where you know Akiwood for example is something that has been created few years back which now has made is behind so many successes in fine finance that it actually created a trend by itself. So you can create new trends and new mothers and fathers through new ingredients and new molecules. And that's why it's extremely important to be to have the best talent, the best perfumers formulating but also helped by very novel ingredients which will help create new new fragrances down the road.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 那么，当你审视整个香水市场时，有多少是经典的旧款，比如**香奈儿五号 (Chanel No. 5)**、**鸦片 (Opium)** 这些，又有多少是新的、更时髦的东西？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: M so when you look at the whole fragrance uh market how much consists of the old classics you know the Chanel number five the opium these kind of things and how much is the new
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 更时髦的东西？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: more funky stuff
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 所以，为了我们听众的兴趣，在高级香水领域，如今市场增长如此之快，以至于高级香水的侵蚀率，当你市场增长率为5%时，你有25%的新品，20%的侵蚀率，所以你可以想象，更替速度相当快。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: so it's so so n just to for the interest of our people listening to us so um it's called the ch so basically in fine fragrances okay uh nowadays the the business the market has grown so much that the aero ion of fine frankers used to when you are at a market growth of let's say 5% you have 25% newness 20% erosion so you can imagine that the churn the replacement is is is quite fast
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 今天，因为**奇华顿**在高级香水领域的平均增长率约为15%，我们的侵蚀率约为10%，但新品率达到25%。是的。所以，基本上，我们仍然有很多经典老款，它们是基础，但是新品的出现。所以，每个品牌都试图在排行榜前10或前15名中占据一席之地。但是，这需要时间。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: today because jivven we are growing more like 15% on average in fine fragrances we are more at the pace of let's say 10% erosion uh but 25% newness Yes. So, so uh basically yes, we still have a lot of old classics which are a bit the foundation the uh but uh essentially the newness has come uh you know so yeah everybody every brand tries to hook it's called you know to put to place basically a perfume in the top 10 top 15 somewhere uh you know but it's it's um you need time to do this
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你用什么香水？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: what do you wear so
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 我通常不为品牌做广告，但我很乐意回答你的问题。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Uh I usually don't advertise for brands but I will answer very happily your question
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: **Prada**的香水，多年来一直是我的香水。我们为**Prada**做了很多香水，我正在用其中一款。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: by Prada which is my fragrance for many many years. Uh you know we have done a lot of fragrances for for Prada and I'm wearing one of them.
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 很好。调香师有多重要？因为你娶了一位调香师。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Very good. How important are the perfumemers because you are married to one.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Yes.
</details>

### 调香师的特质

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你需要具备什么样的技能？显然，你知道，**奇华顿**的核心是拥有一所调香学校。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: What what what kind of skills do you do you need to have? Obviously as you know um you know at the core of of Jividor we have a perfumery school. So the perfumery school
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 抱歉，你们培养了世界上很多调香师吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: and I'm sorry do you have you have educated very many of the world's perfumemers.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 是的，**奇华顿**的调香学校非常有名，因为它成立于近80年前。它实际上培养了世界上销售的香水中约40%的调香师。所以它享誉盛名。要描述一个调香师需要具备什么特质，就从那里开始。我们根据他们是否能闻到气味来选择他们，但这关于“鼻子”的魔力，每个人或多或少都有一个好的鼻子。我的意思是，但区别在于。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Yeah and and the perfumery school of jivor is very well known because it has been established more than almost 80 years ago. Uh it actually train created uh 40% of the let's say 40% of all perfumes were sold in the world were were created by perfumemers coming from the school of juvenile um so it's a well-renown so to characterize what needs to be a perfumer uh it starts there so we select them on the basis of yeah can they smell obviously but you know this magic about the nose everybody has more or less a good nose. I mean, but the difference between
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你说有“超级品尝者”，对吧？有些人有。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Well, you say that you have super tasters, right? You have people with
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 是的，是的，是的。嗯，准确性就像是，就像完美的耳朵等等。但即使你拥有完美的耳朵，它能让你成为莫扎特吗？我不知道。所以，这真的需要对它充满热情，因为你将会在接下来的40年里做这件事。你真的需要热爱它，因为它很艰难。你知道，纸面上看起来很美好，充满魔力。但我们讨论过提案过程。你处于竞争中。作为一名独立的调香师，你十有八九会输掉一个提案。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's the accuracy is like the it's like the perfect ear maybe and so forth. But even if you have the perfect ear, does it make you a mozzard? I don't know. Um, so it's really about having a lot of passion for it because you need you're going to do that for the next 40 years. You you really need to love it because it's tough. You know, it looks very nice on paper. It's magic. But we we we discussed about the briefing process. You are in competition. You as an individual perfumer, you're going to lose a brief nine times out of 10
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 或者十有八九。所以你会经历很多失望，很多挫折，你需要重拾信心去迎接下一个提案，并持续保持创造力。所以，**韧性**和**毅力**极其重要。然后显然，拥有这种创造力，这种新想法的产生等等，显然极其极其重要。所以这就是我们选择他们的方式。首先是韧性和毅力，这是最重要的特质。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: or eight times out of 10. So you have a lot of deceptions. You have a lot of setbacks and you need to grab all your confidence to go on the next brief and to be continuously creative. So resilience, persistence is extremely important. Then obviously having uh you know this this this creativity this uh you know generation of new ideas and so forth is is obviously extremely extremely important. So that's how we we we we select them. It's in the first place in the resilience the persistence that's the most important attribute.
</details>

### 风味业务与健康方案

**Nicolola Tangen**: 好的，我们来谈谈风味。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Okay let's move on to flavors.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 风味。所以它或多或少是相同的业务，但应用不同。我们刚才描述了高级香水，但香水显然也用于家庭护理、个人护理、头发护理，过程相同，提案相同，技能组合相同。然后风味也一样，应用可以是饮料、食物、甜点。因为大多数时候，食物本身提供了很多味道。但由于包装食品等因素，很多我们称之为**挥发性物质**的**前调**在加工过程中会消失。你需要重新加入一些这些**前调**，这些风味会创造出你期望从酸奶中尝到的真正新鲜的草莓味。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Flavors. So it's more or less the same business but the application uh is different. So what we described about fine fragrances but then obviously fragrances going into home care into personal care into hair care it's the same process the same briefing the same you know skill set and then you have the same for flavors where the application would be beverage would be food would be um uh you know sweets uh because most of the time yes the food provides a lot of taste But because of uh you know uh the sort of the the fact that you have packaged food and so forth a lot of what we call the volatile the top notes disappear in the process you need to put back some of those top notes those flavors which are going to create the really fresh strawberry that you expect from a yogurt. And when you say top notes,
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 前调。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: the top notes,
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 前调，它真的是你闻到的香气特征。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: the top notes it's really the the profile when you smell.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 所以你有前调、中调、后调，那是在香水领域。而在风味领域，当你吃东西时，你体验到的大部分味道实际上是**前调**，是**挥发性物质**。你不会咀嚼你吃的东西好几个小时。所以实际上，风味的影响只有几秒钟、几分钟。所以它真的是关于当你剥开一个橙子，当你闻到一个橙子时，那种最初的影响，所有那些挥发性物质扑面而来。然后，是的，然后你随着时间的推移体验到甜味等等。但风味和香水之间最大的区别在于，香水有前调，但当你使用香水时，你可能会佩戴几个小时。所以你期望后调，气味会随着时间持续扩散。而在风味方面，基本上，最初的影响非常短暂。所以这就是为什么。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Uh so you have top notes, middle notes, dry downs, that's in perfumery. Well, in flavors when you eat something most of what you experience in the taste are actually the top notes, the volatiles. You you don't you don't you don't chew your uh whatever you have to eat for hours. So actually the impact of flavors is is a few uh a few seconds a few minutes. So it's really about the first impact when you when you peel an orange when you smell an orange it's the top not all those volatiles which comes to you then you have yeah then you experience sweetness and so forth over over time. But the the big difference between flavor and fragrance is that in fragrance you have the top notes but then when you have a perfume you're going to wear it maybe for a few hours. So you expect the dry downs, the smells continuing to to to diffuse uh over time in in flavors. It's the basically the impact is very short at the beginning. So that's why
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你们制作的哪些著名风味是我们每天都在吃和体验的？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: what what are some of the famous flavors that you have made that we eat and experience every day.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 我们不引用它们。我们不提及它们的名字。我们是完美的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: We don't quote them. We don't name them. We are perfect
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 因为客户关系是秘密的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: because the client relationships are secret.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 没错。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Exactly.
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 但如果你必须说出一两个呢？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: But if you had to do one or two,
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 如果我必须说出一两个。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: if I had to do one or two,
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 如果你必须告诉我一两个。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: if you had to tell me one or two.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 好的，我可以告诉你一个。我可以告诉你一个，因为他们允许我们说。这是一个漫长的故事，它追溯到很久以前，非常有趣，因为它是一个真正的创新。在美国的**Snapple**，它是一个完整的系列。在2000年代初期，基本上有四个擦窗工人决定推出一种新的饮料方式，你知道，真正地在碳酸软饮料方面进行创新。它真的是关于这种非常天然的、基于茶的饮料等等。整个**Snapple**系列，你知道，我们做了。所以这是一个例子，你带着完整的产品来，这是一个有趣的例子，因为它不仅仅是风味，它真的是果汁与少量风味稀释在水中的完整组合，这是一种全新的饮料消费方式。所以那将是一个例子，但风味也用于光谱的另一端。例如，我们所有关于**植物蛋白**的工作，你知道，用**植物蛋白**替代**乳蛋白**，为素食者提供。你需要有基本上尝起来像乳制品的东西，你添加一些风味来提供浓郁感。所以这些东西是会增强风味。但我们还做其他非常有趣的事情，与健康相关。我们都知道糖、盐和脂肪至少过量是不好的。因此，一旦我们的客户去除盐、糖、脂肪或添加**功能性维生素**、**功能性成分**，你又回到了我们是动物的本质。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Uh okay I can tell you one uh I can tell you one because they allow us you know it's a long story it dates back very interesting because it was a true innovation Snapple in the US it was a whole range it's four window cleaners in the early 2000s basically who actually decided to launch a new beverage way of you know to to to really innovate on the side of CSZ carbonated soft drinks and it was really about having this sort of very natural uh beverage based on tea and so forth. or the whole Snapple range, you know, we we did that. Uh and uh so that's one example where you come with the full and it's an interesting example because it was not just the flavor, it was really the full combination of juice with a bit of flavor diluted in water and there was really a new way of consuming beverage. So that would be one one example, but you have flavors going into you know at the other end of the spectrum. Uh for example, all the work that we do on plant-based proteins, you know, the replacement of dairy proteins with plant-based proteins for vegetarians, you need to have basically something which is going to taste like dairy or and you're adding some some flavors which are going to to give the richness. So those things would be flavors which are going to enhance that. But we do other things which are very interesting which relate to health. We all know that sugar, salt and fat is not good for at least the excess of it. And therefore the minute our clients are removing salt, sugar, fat or adding functional vitamins, functional things, you need again back we are animals.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 从理智上讲，你不应该吃糖和盐等等。但你的胃会超越你为吃健康食品所做的任何决定。这意味着你会体验到它。所以如果它尝起来不好，你不会再吃第二次。这就是为什么味道极其重要。这就是我们通过风味和我们称之为**味觉调节剂**所做的工作，以模仿甜味、咸味或减少苦味。这就是我们在**味觉解决方案**中所做的工作。所以它超越了风味本身。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Intellectually you should not eat sugar and salt and so forth. But your belly is going to overtake whatever decisions you have taken to to to eat healthy food. So meaning that you experience that. So if it doesn't taste good, you're not going to do it a second time. So that's why the taste is extremely important. That's that we work on with flavors with what we call taste modulators to mimic to mimic for example the sweetness, the saltiness or to reduce the bitterness. And that's what we do in taste solutions. So it goes beyond flavors.
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 绝对。你谈到了前调。当你们吃东西时，你们还会感受到哪些你们正在研究的东西？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Absolutely. You talked about the top notes. What are the other things that you feel when you eat something that you are working on?
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 味蕾。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: The taste buds.
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 所以味觉的顶端，苦味、甜味、咸味、鲜味、辣味，你知道，可食性。这些都是我们正在研究的东西。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: So the taste top, bitterness, sweetness, saltiness, umami, cucumi, you know, the edibility thing. That's all the thing we work on.
</details>

### 商业模式与知识产权

**Nicolola Tangen**: 嗯，当你们为客户配置好这些后，客户的合同通常会持续多久？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Um when you have um configured this for a client, how long do the client the contracts typically work for?
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 所以这有点回到了香水和风味两方面。我们刚刚赢得了**Tom Ford**的高级香水提案。我们刚刚赢得了**Snapple**的提案。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: So that goes back a bit to to both fragrances and and and flavors, you know. So we just want our uh fine fragrance Tom Font brief. We just won a snapple one.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 嗯，这就是我们商业模式的魅力所在，因为你向我们以及其他公司提交了提案，实际上我们是免费为你工作的。所有这些都是免费的。我们实际上完成了整个工作。我们开发了整个配方。这可能持续了两三年。配方完成了。你决定就是这个。我们是免费工作的，因为。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Um that's a bit the beauty of our business model because you briefed us but along with other houses actually we worked for free for you. All of that is for free. We actually did the whole job. We developed the whole formula. It might me have lasted two or three years. The formula is finished. You decide it's this one. We have worked for free because
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 但现在我必须开始付费了。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: but now I have to start to pay.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 是的。但第一点是，因为我们是免费工作的，所以我们拥有配方的**知识产权 (IP)**。我们拥有这个配方。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Yeah. But the first point is because we were for free, we have the IP on the formula. We own the formula.
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 好的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Okay.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 配方没有专利。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: The formula is not patent.
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 知识产权就是**知识产权**。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: IP being intellectual property.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Yes.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 是的。所以你不能为配方申请专利，但我们拥有配方的秘密。我们拥有开展业务和为你生产这个配方的权利。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Yes. So you cannot patent a formula, but we own the secret of the formula. We own the right to do the business and to produce this formula for you.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 所以没有版税这种东西。我们不需要版税。只是因为我们生产香水或风味，我们基本上会以一定的利润卖给你，这笔利润将支付我们在提案上工作的费用，以及你下次可能发布的其他提案的费用。所以这就是它的运作方式。只要你的产品在货架上，我们就会供应风味或香水。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: So there is no such a thing as royalty. We don't need the royalties. It's just because we manufacture the fragrance or the flavor, we're going to basically sell it to you with a certain profit which is going to pay for the expenses to have worked on the briefs and maybe the other briefs that you might be issuing the next time. So that's how it works. So we we supply the flavor or the fragrance as long as your product is on the shelf.
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 嗯，我们喜欢**奇华顿**的原因之一是，你们生产的东西在客户成本中只占很小一部分。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: M now one of the reasons why we why we love Jiva is that what you uh produce is a small portion of the cost of the client.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Yeah.
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 到底有多大和多小？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: How big and small is it?
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 所以，平均而言，它大约占香水销售成本的4%到5%。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: So it's roughly on average four to 5% of the cost of goods sold on fragrances.
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Yeah.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 而在风味方面，是0.5%到0.6%。所以它在成本中只占非常微小的一部分。但它的美妙之处在于，它也是喜好度最大的驱动因素。所以我们有这种杠杆作用。你知道，这基本上是，因为它非常复杂，这也是我们面临的一个悖论，因为有很多复杂性，而这些复杂性不仅仅在于调香师和调味师。它存在于整个**供应链**中。我们供应17000种成分。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: And it's 0.5% 6% on flavors. So it's a very minuscule part of the cost. But the beauty is that uh it's also the biggest driver of liking. So we have a bit this leverage uh you know which basically uh and because it's so complex that's also the a bit the paradox that we have is that because you have a lot of complexities and complexities don't just lie on perfumemers and flavorists. Uh it's complexities in the whole supply chain. We we supply 17,000 ingredients. you have
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 我们必须为世界各地的客户提供服务。所以，悖论是，他们外包了最重要的喜好度驱动因素，因为它很复杂。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: we have to to to service our clients all around the world. So um the paradox is that they outsource the most important driver of liking because it's complex.
</details>

### 个性化与大众生产

**Nicolola Tangen**: 现在我们想要个性化和独特，然而在很多方面，这些气味和味道变得无处不在。它们无处不在。告诉我关于独特和批量生产之间的权衡。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Now we want to be individual and be special and yet uh in many ways these uh smells and tastes become ubiquitous. They are all over the place. Uh tell me about the kind of the the trade-off between being special and unique and mass production.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 嗯，我不会说这真的是一个冲突。我的意思是，是的，每个人，我的意思是，首先，正如你所说，因为它对品牌的成功至关重要，所以每个人都希望通过定义来与众不同。但这正是为什么它是一个提案系统，他们期望每次都能得到不同的东西，这正是我们商业模式的精髓，我们销售的任何东西，我们销售数千种不同的产品，数千种不同的配方，每一种都针对客户、针对品牌是特定的，我们从不将完全相同的香水出售给其他人，因为这是一个问题，你知道，基本上，是的，我们拥有**知识产权**，但这个**知识产权**是为你而设的。所以，是的，你可能会有一些看起来有点相似或闻起来有点相似或尝起来有点相似的东西，但美妙之处在于可能性是如此无限。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Well, it's not really a I would say it's not really a conflict. I mean uh um yes every I mean in the first place as you as you rightly so because it's so critical to the success of the brand everybody wants to be different by definition uh and but that's exactly why it's a briefing system where they expect having something different from every time and that's really at the essence of our business model that anything that we sell we sell thousands of different products thousands of different formula every one of them is specific specific to the client, specific to the brand and we never sell this same exact fragrance to somebody else because it's a question of um you know basically this yes we have the IP but this is this IP is for you um so um uh yeah you can have things which are looking a bit or smelling a bit tasting a bit but the beauty is that the the possibilities are so infinite
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 而且这种香水可能非常适合这个品牌，但可能不太适合或不太相关于另一个品牌。而且可能不适合这个市场。你知道，显然消费者，我的意思是，正如你所提到的，它与记忆、味觉和嗅觉、情感、你的感受、文化相关联。所以，在市场方面，趋势和差异与国家和民族一样多。所以多样性是如此广泛和巨大，以至于实际上，所有东西看起来都一样这种想法并没有发生。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: and uh this fragrance might be great for this brand but not might not be so suitable or so relevant for this other brand. So and maybe not relevant for this market. You know there's obviously consumers I mean as as you mentioned it's linked to memories, taste and smell, emotions, how you feel, culture. So there are as many trends and differences in terms of markets as there are countries and and ethnics and so on. So the diversity is so wide and so big that in fact uh you know this idea about everything looking the same is not uh is not happening.
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 现在我们有一位艺术家，她正在用气味进行创作。她叫**Sisil Tulos**。她是挪威人。她在德国工作。她正在创造一个房间，当你走进房间时，你会因为气味而哭泣。你觉得你们有时会用你们所做的事情来操纵人们吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Now we have an artist who is working on you know with smell. She's called Sisil Tulos. She's Norwegian. She works out of Germany. Uh and she's making for instance a room where you come into the room and you start crying you know on the back of the smell. Do you feel that you manipulate people sometimes with what you do?
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 不，我们让人更快乐。我们不操纵他们。我们，嗯，操纵是一个非常具有攻击性的词。我想换一种说法，当你想到我们所说的**消费品香水**时。所以你可以争辩说，当你使用地板清洁剂或织物时，它需要闻起来很好。所以是的，它是关于拥有宜人的气味。但在某种程度上，香水的作用是强化你的地板是干净的这个想法，强化你的头发是干净的这个想法，强化这个想法。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: No, we make people happier. We don't manipulate them. We we uh um manipulation is a very uh very aggressive word. Uh I would say in another world another way um in when you think about especially what we call fragrances for consumer products. So you could argue that when you do and use your floor cleaner or a fabric, uh it needs to smell very good. So yes, it's about having the pleasant smell. But in a way, the fragrance role is to reinforce the idea that your floor is clean and reinforce the idea that your hair clean and reinforce the idea. So
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 有时，当我的妻子不在家时，在她回家之前，我会在地板上洒一点，擦拭一下，这样她就会闻到很干净的味道，她会觉得我做得很好，对吧？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: sometimes sometimes when my wife is away I put a bit when before she comes home I put a bit of that on the floor wipe it out a bit so she should smell really clean and she thinks I've done a great job right
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 绝对。所以你可以说你在操纵你的妻子，也许吧。所以，这就是我的意思。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: absolutely so you can say are you manipulating your wife maybe so so that's where I'm coming from
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 绝对。这个行业现在是什么样子？你们有多少参与者？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: absolutely how does this industry look like now how many players are you
</details>

### 行业格局与竞争策略

**Gilles Andrier**: 嗯，是的，我们有四个主要参与者，但还有许多其他参与者，有中型参与者，也有非常小的参与者。我可以说，我自己在这个行业中成长，有四个主要参与者，他们被称为**FNF**（香精香料）核心**FNF**参与者。但在最近几年，你知道，行业发生了变化，其中至少有两家，即**芬美意 (Firmenich)** 与**帝斯曼 (DSM)** 合并，以及**国际香料香精公司 (IFF)** 与**杜邦 (DuPont)** 合并，它们改变了战略，通过与**杜邦**和**帝斯曼**联手，它们变得更像是我们所说的**大型成分集团**。所以这就是竞争格局发生变化的地方，而我们没有采取相同的战略。我们的战略更多是继续专注于我们的**FNF**领域，但同时通过进入我们所说的**相邻领域**的成分，不一定是香精和香料，而是那些实际上具有相同属性或与香精香料具有相同商业模式的东西。举个例子，**活性美容**。我们在八到十年前进入了这个领域，这些成分实际上能让护肤产品让你的皮肤更年轻、更美丽。所以，由创新驱动，护肤品中的**功能性成分**、**活性成分**对客户来说绝对是关键，它由大量的创新驱动。所以，在某种程度上，这种商业模式看起来与香水相似，而且在财务状况方面也相似。所以我们进入了这个领域，现在它是一个3亿美元的业务。我们最近在化妆品方面也做了同样的事情。我们在意大利收购了一家公司，该公司为高端市场提供化妆品解决方案，理念相同，这使我们能够参与更广泛的美容领域，包括护发、高级香水、护肤和化妆品。我们在味觉方面也做了同样的事情，进入了**天然色素**和我们所说的**植物活性成分 (phytoactives)** 等相邻领域，这些**植物活性成分**是植物性成分，能让人保持健康等等。所以这就是我们通过扩展到相邻领域来发展我们的商业模式的方式，但我们始终忠于我们对客户的承诺。

**Gilles Andrier**: Um well uh not really. So the Chinese uh they entered the market many years back but more on the what we call the ingredient side making through the you know they are good with with chemistry they're actually now good with biotechnology uh so making some of the ingredients that we use in fragrances um and we use them as suppliers to feed what we do we went into China 30 years ago we are we are Chinese ourselves we are 1200 people in China we have five big sites We deal with local Chinese clients, big clients. So we are really well established and we have not seen relevant sort of big Chinese competitors emerging.
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你们是否看到了新的竞争对手，例如来自中国的？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Are you seeing new competitors for instance from China?
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 嗯，嗯，不完全是。中国的公司在很多年前就进入了市场，但更多是在我们所说的**成分**方面，通过化学和现在的生物技术来制造我们用于香水的一些成分。我们把他们作为供应商来使用。我们30年前进入中国，我们自己就是中国公司，我们在中国有1200名员工，有五个大型基地。我们与当地的中国客户，大客户打交道。所以我们已经非常稳固，我们没有看到相关的、大型的中国竞争对手出现。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Um well uh not really. So the Chinese uh they entered the market many years back but more on the what we call the ingredient side making through the you know they are good with with chemistry they're actually now good with biotechnology uh so making some of the ingredients that we use in fragrances um and we use them as suppliers to feed what we do we went into China 30 years ago we are we are Chinese ourselves we are 1200 people in China we have five big sites We deal with local Chinese clients, big clients. So we are really well established and we have not seen relevant sort of big Chinese competitors emerging.

### 企业文化：绩效与关怀

**Nicolola Tangen**: 让我们谈谈企业文化。你如何定义**奇华顿**的企业文化？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Let's move on to uh to the corporate culture. How would you define the corporate culture at Jivoda?
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 嗯，这对我来说绝对是关键。所以，当我加入**奇华顿**时，我32年前偶然进入**奇华顿**。没有人知道产品背后有“鼻子”和调味师在创造它们。我真的是偶然发现了这个神奇的业务。但我也发现了一种吸引我的文化。所以**奇华顿**的文化非常强大。我认为它定义了**奇华顿**的成功，并且是其核心。但我基本上是在我的首席执行官任期内发展和丰富了这种文化。所以，是的，我们显然拥有巨大的多样性。是的，我们是一家瑞士公司，但瑞士只有800万人，所以它不能定义我们的文化。我们是一个真正的跨国文化，但这也是我们在过去20、25年甚至更早之前进行了多次收购和合并的结果，这使我们能够拥有一个非常包容、多元的文化，每个人都围绕着这种文化团结在一起。这种文化是什么？嗯，我们最终在几年前设法定义了它，因为说自己拥有强大的文化是一回事，但它到底是什么呢？所以我们能最好地阐述它的方式，让每个人都对此感到非常强烈，那就是它几乎是两个领域。一个是真正以**绩效驱动**。我们不仅仅因为我们是上市公司，不仅仅因为我们必须实现财务目标，而是简单地因为我们感到对客户负有极大的责任。这又回到了商业模式。他们将最重要的喜好度驱动因素外包给我们。我们最好能胜任这项任务。所以，**表现出色**、**挑战自我**、**鼓舞人心**、**富有创造力**绝对是关键，这也是让我们的员工充满热情，并始终准备好付出额外努力的原因。所以，绩效和挑战是其中的一部分。第二部分，我认为它更能定义我们，就是我们所说的**“心与灵魂”**。我们是一家**关怀型公司**。我们是一家**人性化公司**。不是因为我们喜欢说我们是**人性化公司**，而是因为首先，这就是我们的DNA，DNA的魔力是如何演变的，而人性每天都在经受考验。当你不得不重组公司，不得不解雇员工时，人性就会受到考验。你如何做？你是否玩弄手段？不，你带着关怀和人道去做。所以，当事情变得更加困难时，人性也会受到考验。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Well, this is something that is absolutely key to me. So um when I joined Jivodon, I bumped into Jivodon 32 years ago by by chance. Nobody knew that behind products you had noses and and flavories creating those. I really bumped into this magic this magic business by by coincidence and chance. But I also discovered a culture which basically attracted me. So the culture at Jividon is very strong. I think it defines and it's really core to the success of Jividon. But basically I've grown this culture. have enriched this culture all along my tenure as as cogn so the culture yeah we have obviously the this huge diversity yes we are a Swiss company but it's a Swiss company we have 8 million people in Switzerland so it doesn't define us as as a culture we are a multi- truly a multinational cultures but it's also the result of the fact that we have done many acquisitions many u mergers over the last 20, 25 years, but even before which has enabled us to have a very sort of um inclusive culture, diverse culture culture and really where everybody uh sort of joins around this culture and this culture what is it? Well, we we we we finally because we finally managed to define it a few years back because it's one thing to say I've got a strong culture but what what is it? So the best way we could articulate it where everybody felt really strong about that is that it's almost two spheres. One is really about performance driven. We are not not just because we are stocklisted company, not because um you know we have to def to to deliver on financials but simply because we feel I feel extremely obligated visa VR clients. It goes back to the business model. they are outsourcing the most important driver of lacking to us. We better uh be up to the task and um so being performing, being challenging, being inspirational, being creative is is absolutely key and that's what makes our people passionate about and always you know uh you know ready for the for the extra. So the performance the challenging is really one part of it. The second part which I think defines us even more so is really what we call the heart and soul. We are a caring company. We are a human company. Not because we like saying that we are a human company but because in the first place that's how that's how I would say our DNA the magic of the DNA has has evolved and the humanity is tested every day. is tested when you have to restructure jiu- you have to let go people you say what you do you do you say you don't play tricks you do it with caring with humanity so humanity is also tested when things you know are more difficult
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 在我们如何相互关联方面，领导层，我是**奇华顿**的首席执行官，我们都非常平易近人。所以这真的是一种存在方式，我认为这是文化魔力的一部分，总是很难定义魔力，它定义了化学反应，但在**奇华顿**非常强大。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: uh in how also we relate to each other the the leadership I'm I'm the CE jivon we are very we are all very accessible so it's really the way of being which is part of I would say the magic of a culture very always very difficult to define ind the magic, it defines the chemistry, but it's very strong at JIV.
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 所以你担任首席执行官已经20年了。所以我期望企业文化能反映你作为一个人。所以，如果我把这些特质读给你听，你知道，**绩效驱动**、**有创造力**、**有爱心**、**平易近人**，这些特质不也能用在你身上吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: So, you have been for 20 years. So, I would expect the corporate culture to reflect who you are as a person. So, if I read it back to you, you know, performance-driven, creative, caring, and accessible aren't those characteristics that we can put on you as well.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 是的。否则，它不可能运作21年。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Yeah. Otherwise, it could not have worked for 21 years.
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 这就是我的意思。所以。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: That's what I mean. So there
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 因为改变一种全球文化需要10年。你已经有20年了，所以我期望这家公司能真正反映你作为一个人。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: because it takes because it takes 10 years to uh change a global culture. You've had 20 years and so I expect this company to really reflect you as a person.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 是的。但你知道，我也是一个非常谦逊的人。所以这不是那种我一早醒来就说“这就是文化”的事情。我认为**奇华顿**的核心DNA和我这个人之间有一种神奇的契合。这种契合是存在的。所以是的，我将自己定义为一个**有绩效**、**有爱心**的人。你认为**奇华顿**与同领域其他公司最大的区别是什么？你认为主要的差异化因素是什么？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Yeah. But you know I'm also a very humble guy. So it's not such a thing where I said I woke up one morning and said here's going to be the culture. I think there was a magic fit between what Jivon had in its core DNA and who I was who I am and the match was there. So yes I define myself as this the performing guy and the caring guy. And what do you think the biggest difference between Jivoda and other companies in the in the same field? What do you think is the main differentiator?
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 我不能代表他们发言，因为我从未为他们工作过。我与他们竞争。但我唯一能说的是，我们的客户就是这样评价我们的。你知道，我刚才定义**奇华顿**文化的方式，实际上与我们被谈论的方式非常吻合。所以，我认为**人性化**的一面，**关怀**的一面，也许定义了我们。并不是说其他人不人性化，但本质上，这一点非常突出。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: I cannot talk on their behalf because I've never worked for them. I compete with them. Uh but the only thing I can say is that uh that's how our clients talk about us. you know the way I just define the culture of Jividon actually was something that we we really um really echoes the way we are being talked about. Uh so so uh I think the humanity side the caring side is something that maybe defines us um not that the others are not human but essentially that's what's come out very strongly.
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你们现在正在努力改进企业文化的哪个部分？或者特别关注哪个部分？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Is there anything any part of the copper culture you try to improve just now or working particularly on?
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 嗯，是的，因为我们永远不会完美。所以我们变成了一家非常大的公司。当我开始工作时，我们有4000人。现在我们有17000人。我们成长了，我们改造了公司，但始终非常勤奋地关注增长，但不能以牺牲**敏捷性**为代价。所以，总是寻找方法来提高**敏捷性**，接触非常小的客户，不被视为不关心小客户的“大**奇华顿**”，这对于快速执行非常重要。我们被认为在执行力方面非常出色，但同时，你知道，关于**敏捷性**等方面，我们还可以进一步改进。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Um yeah because we are never never perfect. So we became a very large company. When I started we were 4,000 people. We are 17,000 people. Um we grew we transformed the company but uh always being extremely u you know diligent about um growing but not at the expense of the agility. So finding always you know ways to improve the agility uh to reach out to very small clients to be not considered as the big big jivodon which is not going to take care of the small clients is super important to be fast on execution um we are considered very very good on execution but at the same time you know something around agility and so forth is something that we can further further improve.
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你们如何避免官僚主义？我想这几乎是文化的一部分，也许也是避免它的一部分。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: How do you avoid bureaucracy? I would say that's almost part of the culture and and maybe part to avoid it.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 嗯，不，但即使超越这一点，我也会非常直接。在**奇华顿**，官僚主义不会存活超过3秒。这意味着我们之所以能做到这一点，是因为我们都在这个行业中成长起来。我曾负责财务，曾负责运营，我曾是一名销售人员。我做过这份工作。向我汇报的人，那些负责部门和下一级的人，他们都在公司内部成长，做过业务。所以我们知道我们不能被牵着鼻子走。我们非常务实。我们非常具体。所以官僚主义是我们几乎天生就会避免的东西。现在我们仍然需要努力工作，确保我们不会被规模和流程过于复杂等因素所压倒。这就是我刚才谈到的工作。但这也是文化的一部分，我们仍然像一家大公司一样运作，但仍然像一家**小型创业公司**一样思考。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Well, no, but even beyond that, I will be very direct. Uh and hotel jivon doesn't survive more than 3 seconds. Meaning that we are because we have all grown in this business. I've been I've been running figures. I've been running operations. I've been a salesperson. I' I've done the job. And the people reporting to me, the ones who are running divisions and the next levels, they all grown within the company having done the business. So we know where we we cannot take be taken on a ride. We are very pragmatic. We are very concrete. Um so the bureaucracy is something that we we we almost by nature avoid. Now we still need to do hard work that we are not overwhelmed by by the size and the fact that processes are too complex and so forth. That's the work I was just talking about. But that's also part of the culture to really um we still live like we are large company but still think as a as a small entrepreneurial company.
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你们如何确保事情快速敏捷？你们如何提高速度？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: And how do you make sure that things are speedy and agile? How do you work on speed?
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 所以在速度方面，我们实际上做了相当重要的事情。举个例子，我们显然有很多**供应链**上的流程，这又回到了复杂性。几年前我们做了什么，你知道，我们全球大约有130个基地。所以我们将我们所有的流程，所有的**供应链**都整合到三个大型的**奇华顿**共享服务中心。这是一件非常重要的事情。我们从不外包这些。它们是**奇华顿**的一部分。但这实际上使我们在执行所有这些流程方面做得更好。你如何处理云端，你如何供应你的成分等等，这也使我们能够应用**人工智能 (AI)**，应用**数字化**。在三个基地上部署技术和改变事情比在130个基地上容易得多。所以这真的帮助了我们，我们通过容纳更多的流程来继续这样做。所以这我认为是我们自己在执行力方面实现差异化的部分方式。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: So on speed uh we actually have done uh quite uh significant things. Uh as an example we have uh obviously we have a a lot of processes you know on the supply chain again backs to the complexity what we did a few years back you know we have roughly 130 sites around the world. So we regrouped all our processes all the supply chains into three big shared services centers belonging to Jivodon. That's a very big important thing. We never outsource those. They are part of Jividon. But that allowed us actually to be much better on execution all those processes. How you deal with clouds, how do you supply uh your ingredients and so forth and that allowed us as well to apply AI to apply digital. it's much easier to put in place technology and change things on three sides than compared to 130 sides. So that has really helped us and we continue doing that by housing even more processes. So that's part of the way we've I think um differentiated ourselves on the execution.
</details>

### 领导力原则

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你最重要的领导力原则是什么？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: What are your most important leadership principles?
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 嗯，这有点回到了文化。我认为这真的是关于**绩效**和**关怀**。嗯，我想说，我们学会了，首先是，这有点像我们创造的**股权故事**，你知道，总是承诺非常雄心勃勃的目标，这在某种程度上，回顾过去，总是帮助我，帮助我们，不要羞于设定看起来令人生畏的雄心勃勃的目标。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Well, it goes back a bit uh you know to the to to to to the culture. I think it's really about uh back to the performing and caring. Um I would say that uh you know we have learned to uh first is to is to it's a bit the equity story that we have created you know committing on on very uh ambitious targets always that has really in a way looking backwards always helped me help help us that not being shy about setting ambitious targets which look intimidating
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 但那是你实现它们或接近它们的唯一途径。而且，我们所做到的，你知道，我们以五年为一个周期来运营公司。所以我们已经完成了四次五年的周期。我们总是兑现我们承诺的一切。所以这真的是我们工作中根深蒂固的一部分，就是要**兑现你的承诺**。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: uh but that's the only way you're going to get to them or close to them And uh the thing is that what we have managed you know I've done we we run the company with five years cycle. So it's been four five four times five year cycle which you've done. We have always delivered on everything that we've committed. Uh so this is something that is really ingrained uh in what we do is really to deliver on what you promise.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 第二件事是关于**成为企业家**。你知道，我认为通过**创新**寻找方法，我认为这极其重要。嗯，这是我们工作的核心。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Uh the second thing is really about being entrepreneurs. you know, I think uh finding ways to uh through the innovation, I think that's that's extremely important. Um, which is at the core of of of what we do.
</details>

### 个人生活与职业建议

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你的一天是怎样的？你什么时候起床？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: How does your day look like? When do you wake up?
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 嗯，我不会像很多首席执行官说的那样，早上5点起床。你知道，我不能早上5点起床。所以，嗯，实际上，我经常为了赶飞机而很早起床，但，是的，大概早上7点到7点半，然后我就开始了一天的工作。所以，是的，通常是紧张的一天。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Uh, so I don't wake up at 5:00 a.m. like a lot of CEOs say, you know, I I can't wake up at 5:00 a.m. So, well, well, actually, I wake up many times to patch the plane, but uh yeah, so say 7 a.m. 7:30 and and I go on for the day. Uh so uh yeah usually an intense day.
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 嗯，你如何放松？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: M and how do you relax?
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 所以放松我做几件事。我做，是的，我做一些运动，你知道，骑自行车。以前跑步，但膝盖有点不行了，所以骑自行车对膝盖更柔和。所以很多，实际上，你知道，骑几个小时的自行车非常有趣，因为它几乎是，当你骑车时，想法会突然冒出来，这是一种非常放松的，你知道，冥想时间，在自行车上。我有很多孩子，我有六个孩子，所以与他们互动，享受生活，从这个角度来说，我是一个非常幸运的人，我们有一个美妙幸福的家庭，一个美妙的妻子，这也是我享受和放松的一部分，但做了21年的首席执行官是很艰难的。是的，我知道你将成为同一家公司的董事长，所以这很好。但是，然后你和家人一起乘坐一艘大充气艇在欧洲旅行，对吧？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: So relaxing I do a few things. Uh I do uh yeah I do a bit of I do a lot of sports you know cycling uh running in the past but the knees gave up a bit so the cycling is softer for the knees. So a lot and that's actually uh you know cycling for uh for a few hours it's very interesting because it's almost uh thoughts come pop up as you cycle and it's a very almost uh uh you know relax how do you say meditation time on on the bicycling on the bicycle uh I've got many children I've got six children so uh interacting with them enjoying I'm a very lucky guy from that standpoint and we have a wonderful happy family um wonderful wife and that's also part of what I enjoy and relax but it's tough to be a CEO for 21 years. Yeah, I know you you are going to become the chairman in the same company, so that's good. But um and then you were um kind of traveling around Europe uh with a big uh rib, right, with your family, you know?
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 是的。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Yeah.
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 驾船穿越地中海。这是一种不同的度假方式。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: Driving through the Mediterranean. Uh it's a different type of holiday.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 是的。所以，是的，我年轻的时候经常航海，但你需要更多的时间来驾驶帆船、参加帆船赛等等。所以，我们全家都喜欢大海。所以多年来，我们，一艘充气艇是一种半充气船，进行冒险，你知道，两台发动机，把所有的孩子都放在船上，每人一个包，从法国南部海岸一直到西西里岛，再回到整个海岸线。我们连续做了五、六年、七年，中途在酒店停靠。嗯，这很有趣，因为它相当冒险。而且它关乎享受生活。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Yeah. So, uh yeah, I used to do a lot of sailing when I was much younger, but you need a bit more time to sell boats, riatas, and all of that. So, and we love the sea with the family. So, for many years we we A rib is a semi-inflatable boat and going adventure, you know, two engines putting all the kids on the boat, one bag each and going from the south coast of France all the way down to Sicily back to all the coastline of and we did that five, six, seven years in a row, stopping in hotels. Um, and it's a lot of fun because it's it's quite adventurous. uh and it's about you know enjoying enjoying life together.
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 那么，当你在餐厅里，你们是一个嗅觉和味觉世家，你知道，妻子是调香师，你听到，你们怎么吃饭？我的意思是，就像“嘿，闻闻这个罗勒”，“嘿，看看那个番茄和别的番茄不一样”。进来。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: So when you are in a restaurant and you are like a smell and taste family you know with a perfumemer as a wife and and you hear how do you how do you eat? I mean it's just like hey uh smell this uh basil uh hey look at that tomato is different than other tomatoes. come in.
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 不，不，不。这不是一种强迫症，你必须每天谈论你所做的一切的味觉和嗅觉。实际上很有趣的是，我的妻子是一位调香师。嗯，好吧，也许这与DNA有关，她的母亲是一位非常出色的厨师，所以也许这方面有一些传承。我的儿子也想成为一名调香师。所以也许有一些东西在那里。但我们，是的，我们尽量不在每顿饭都过多地谈论味觉和嗅觉。我们喜欢烹饪。我喜欢烹饪。这也是我放松的方式，尝试新事物，并享受乐趣。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: No, no, no. It's not an obsessive thing where you have you have to talk taste and smell every day on everything that you that you uh actually funny enough my my wife who is a a perfumer. Um okay, maybe it has to do with DNA and so forth, her mother was an absolutely outstanding cook and so maybe there is something around around that that went uh uh that went there. My my son, you know, would like to also be a perfumer. So there is something maybe in there. Um but we yeah we we we we try not to talk too much about taste and smell at every meal together. We we love cooking. I love cooking. That's how also I relax uh experimenting things and
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 玩得开心。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: having fun.
</details>

**Nicolola Tangen**: 你对你的六个孩子和所有听这个播客的年轻人有什么建议？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolola Tangen**: And what is your adi advice to your six children and to other young people who listen to this podcast?
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 嗯，是的，首先，你知道，当我转任**董事长**时，我想我会怀念什么，但我会确保我不会错过它，通过持续参与，就是真正地与人交往。你知道，我们从事的业务让我非常感激，因为客户的多样性巨大，你必须深入了解他们在做什么。但同样地，对待员工也是如此，我总是非常投入，通过互动，尝试提供建议，但也倾听年轻人，倾听那些在**奇华顿**发展的人。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: Well uh yeah first you know as I move uh to the German role you know what I think uh I will be missing but I will make sure that I don't miss it by continuously be engaged is um really being engaged with people you know we are in a business where I've been extremely grateful I'm extremely grateful because this huge diversity of clients where you have to go deep into what they are doing Um but in the same way with employees and I've always been extremely let's say engaged by interacting giving trying to give advice but also listening to the young to the to the ones who are developing uh at Jivodon
</details>

**Gilles Andrier**: 我也会对我的孩子们说同样的话，我确实这样做了，有几件事对我很有用，我不是那种很喜欢管理书籍、讲座和教条的人，关于他们应该做什么等等。我称之为“找到你自己的风格”。你知道，当我成为首席执行官时，有上千人告诉我作为首席执行官该怎么做。尽管我当时很年轻，但我真的，你知道，是的，倾听，但同时又想走自己的路，并对此充满信心，发展出自己的风格。所以，有几件事和几条建议。首先，不要通过说“我想成为首席执行官”来规划你的职业生涯。那是成为首席执行官的最佳方式。它本身不是一个目标。它从来都不是我的目标。驱动我的是享受我所从事的每一份工作。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gilles Andrier**: uh and the same way I would say that I would say the same thing to my kids which I which I do which is a few things which have worked out for me and I'm not somebody who is very much into management books and giving lectures and dogmas about you know what they should do and so forth. I call that find your own suit. You know, when I became a CEO, I had a thousand people telling me what to do as a CEO. And even though I was quite young, I really, you know, uh yeah, listen, but at the same time wanted to go my own way and be confident about that and and grow my own suit. So, a few things and a few advice. First, don't plan your careers by saying I want to be a CEO. That's the best way not to become a CEO. And it's not a goal by itself. It has never been a goal for myself. What has been driving me is to enjoy every day of any job I was given.

**Gilles Andrier**: 而且，要产生影响，而不是地位或其他东西。所以，我非常**好奇**。所以我认为这也帮助了我。**好奇心**是许多工作的最好朋友。我认为满足这种**好奇心**可以让你参与，可以让你学习，可以让你提问，也可以让你倾听。嗯，我认为这是我给的另一个建议。第三个建议是，是的，同样地，规划你的核心，我认为这不是正确的做法，但同时，**实验**非常重要。你知道，我的孩子们，我想许多年轻人也是如此。我怎么知道我想做什么，因为我从未做过。所以，这一切都关乎**实验**，通过将自己置于一个你会学到东西，你会学到关于你自己的东西，你喜欢什么，不喜欢什么，或者突然发现其他能力的情况来发现自己。我以为我是一个超级害羞的人。我永远无法卖出一公斤任何东西，直到我说“好吧，我去试试”，然后你自己去做，你参与其中，你发现你可能已经培养了这些技能。所以这关乎**实验**，因此也关乎**承担风险**。在我的职业生涯中，我承担了很多风险，在每一份工作中，你知道，跳进游泳池，并不知道自己将要做什么，只是运用我的信任、我的信心和我的大脑，并倾听以学习这份工作。所以，我认为这在很大程度上帮助了成长。但首先，享受你所做的事情，因为如果你享受你所做的事情，你就会有动力。如果你有动力，你你就会做得很好。它会显现出来，你就会成长。

**Gilles Andrier**: Um and uh having an impact uh rather than status or whatever things and so um I'm extremely curious. So I think that has also helped me. Curiosity is the best friend for many jobs. Um and I think fulfilling this curiosity allows to engage, allows to learn, allows to ask questions but allows to listen. Um and I think that's another advice I would give. Third advice is uh uh yeah in the same way planning your core is I don't think it's the right thing to do but at the same time it's very important to experiment. you know, my kids, and I guess it's the it's it's the case for many young people. How do I know what I want to do because I've never done it. So, it's all about experimenting, discovering yourself by by putting yourself into a situation where you're going to learn something, where you're going to learn something about you, what you like, what you don't like, or suddenly def discovering other muscles. I thought I was a super shy guy. I would never be able to sell one kilo of anything until I said okay I I'll I'll go and try and then you do it yourself you engage you and you discover that you you you maybe have grown the skills um so it's about experimenting and therefore it's about taking risks and I've in my career I've taken a lot of risk on every job you know uh jumping into the swimming pool by not really knowing what I was going to do but just using my trust my confidence and my brain and listening to to learn the job. So it's it's a lot about that I think which helps growing. But in the first place, enjoy what you do because if you do it if you do enjoy what you do, you're going to be motivated. If you are motivated, you're going to do a good job. It's going to show and you're going to grow.
