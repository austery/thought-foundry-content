### 冲突后的反思与新书发布

2023年10月7日之后，**《环球邮报》**（The Globe and Mail: 加拿大全国性日报）的**马莎·莱德曼**（Marsha Lederman: 加拿大记者和作家）开始分享她对这场冲突的看法。她在这第一年撰写的专栏文章已被收录到一本新书《10月7日：寻找人道主义中点》（October 7th: Searching for the Humanitarian Middle.）中。她的思想是如何演变的？她对未来又有哪些希望和担忧？马莎，很高兴你能来到我们的节目。你最近怎么样？

<p class="english-text">After October 7th, Marsha Lederman of The Globe and Mail began sharing her thoughts about the conflict. The columns she wrote during the first year have been gathered in a new book, "October 7th: Searching for the Humanitarian Middle." How has her thinking evolved, and what are her hopes and fears for the future? Marsha, it's great to have you on the program. How are you doing?</p>
</details>

我很好。非常感谢你们邀请我。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm okay. Thank you so much for having me.</p>
</details>

### 撰写冲突报道的内心挣扎

我想从你书中的一段引文开始。书中写道：“我当时想，无论我写什么，说什么，都会受到批评。我可能会受到来自各方的批评。人们会指出我是犹太人，并以此争辩说我带有偏见，不适合撰写此事。但我也是一个进步派自由主义犹太人，并且早已公开反对**本雅明·内塔尼亚胡**（Benjamin Netanyahu: 以色列总理）的政府。我自认为是一个人道主义者，一直以来都极度渴望与巴勒斯坦人实现和平，并为所有人争取尊严和安全。我感到，在这个棘手的议题上，我必然会激怒各方人士。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to start with a quote from your book. It reads: 'I thought, whatever I write, whatever I say, I am going to get criticism. I am possibly going to get it from all sides. It'll be pointed out that I am Jewish, and the argument will be that I'm too biased to write about this. But I am also a progressive liberal Jew who is already on record as being opposed to the government of Benjamin Netanyahu. I consider myself a humanist and have always desperately wanted peace with the Palestinians and dignity and security for all. It felt inevitable that I would anger people on all points of this tricky spectrum.'</p>
</details>

现在，马莎，在你之前的书《亲吻红楼梯》（Kiss the Red Stairs）中，你写到了你与身为**大屠杀幸存者**（Holocaust survivors: 指二战期间纳粹对犹太人进行种族灭绝的幸存者）的父母一起成长的经历。你谈到了随之而来的**代际创伤**（intergenerational trauma: 创伤经历对后代产生的影响）。鉴于这一切，你最初是如何考虑撰写10月7日事件的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, Marsha, in your previous book, "Kiss the Red Stairs," you wrote about your experiences growing up with your parents who were Holocaust survivors. You talk about the intergenerational trauma that came with that. Given all of that, what were your initial thoughts about your approach to writing about October 7th?</p>
</details>

是的，正如你刚才所读，我甚至不确定自己是否应该写这件事。那是第一个令人震惊的周末。当时正值感恩节，也是一个犹太节日，同时还是我儿子15岁的生日。所以，那本应是我家里一个非常快乐的时刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, well, I wasn't even sure if I should write about it as you just read about. I was, you know, that first shocking weekend. It was Thanksgiving. It was also a Jewish holiday, and it was my son's 15th birthday. So it was, you know, a very kind of happy time at my home.</p>
</details>

然后，我完全专注于以色列发生的事情。我把头埋在手机里，不断地查看信息，同时努力做一个不那么糟糕的母亲，因为我儿子正在过生日周末，我试图在那其中找到一些快乐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then I became completely focused on what had happened and what was happening in Israel. And I, you know, my head buried in my phone constantly while trying to be a not terrible mother to my son, having his birthday weekend and trying to find some joy in that.</p>
</details>

我满脑子想的都是我多么想写这件事，但我又不确定。我能从这个角度来写吗？这公平吗？我能将自己从自身的创伤、你提到的代际创伤中抽离出来，作为一个记者，恰当地撰写这些事件吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And all I could think about was how much I wanted to write about it, but I wasn't sure. Could I write from this perspective? Would that be fair? Could I remove myself from my own trauma, my intergenerational traumas you mentioned, and write about these events properly as a journalist?</p>
</details>

我当时也正在经历一种前所未有的创伤。我儿子正在举办生日过夜派对，我睡着了。有一次，我被敲门声惊醒。我当时想，他们来了。他们来抓我了。那种感觉非常迅速。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I was also experiencing that trauma in a way I had never experienced in my life. There was my son was having a birthday sleepover and I fell asleep. And at one point I was woken up by a knock on the door. And I thought, they're here. They've they've come to get me.</p>
</details>

当然，那是我儿子的一个朋友，但这是一种我经常做的噩梦，梦见我被纳粹追捕。突然间，这些纳粹变成了10月7日发动袭击的**哈马斯**（Hamas: 巴勒斯坦逊尼派伊斯兰政治军事组织）恐怖分子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that was quick. Of course, it was one of his friends, but this was, you know, it's a recurring dream that I have that I or nightmare that I'm being hunted down by Nazis. And suddenly these Nazis had become the Hamas terrorists who had led these attacks on October 7th.</p>
</details>

所有这些都在发生，都在我脑海中盘旋。但我最终意识到，在思考这件事并与我的编辑们深入交流后，我不需要将这些历史和当代的包袱从我将要写的内容中移除，甚至不需要为了写它而移除。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So all of this was happening and swirling. But what I came to finally realise, in thinking about it and really speaking with my editors, was that I didn't I didn't need to remove this historical and contemporary baggage from what I was going to write about it, or even in order to write about it.</p>
</details>

事实上，它为讨论带来了新的视角。所以那个周末，以及之后很多次，我确实写了这件事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I in fact, it brought something else to the table. So I did write about it that weekend and many, many times since.</p>
</details>

### 从初始反应到人道主义视角

那么，请你谈谈你的想法是如何从最初的几篇专栏文章发展到整整一年的？它在那段时间里改变了吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, give me a sense of how your thinking changed from sort of those first initial columns to sort of a full year. Did it change over over that period of time?</p>
</details>

哦，变化太大了，对吧？与其说是我的想法，不如说是我在观察这些正在发生的恐怖事件。随着加沙战争的日益恶化，我不再仅仅作为一个犹太人、一个大屠杀幸存者的孩子来回应以色列人民受到的袭击。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh well, so much changed, right? It wasn't even my thinking so much as I was observing these horrors that were going on. And as the war in Gaza got worse and worse, I was no longer writing. Just as a Jewish person and a child of Holocaust survivors who was responding to this attack on the people of Israel.</p>
</details>

我作为一个人类，一个母亲，也在关注加沙的苦难，并思考那些被扣押的人质，他们被扣押了很久很久。我觉得我的观察随着事件的演变而发展，我也能够从10月8日和9日开始写作时的那种情绪化的自我中稍微抽离出来，变得更像一个见证这一切的人类和记者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was writing as a human being, as a mother watching the suffering in Gaza as well, and thinking about the hostages who were being held and held and held. And I felt like my observations evolved through this time as events evolved, and also that I was able to step back a little from that emotional self that started on writing on October 8th and 9th and become more, you know, more of a human being and a journalist witnessing this.</p>
</details>

你书的副标题是“寻找人道主义中点”，这具体指的是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The subtitle of your book, "Searching for the Humanitarian Middle," what exactly is that?</p>
</details>

是的，我当时处于这样一个境地：我是一个犹太社区的成员，同时也是一个小写字母“l”的自由主义者，一个你所说的自豪的进步派。但我并不认同我从任何一方听到的所有言论。我越是思考，就越是不断地回到“我处于中间”这个想法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I was in this space where I, you know, I'm a member of the Jewish community. I'm also a small-L liberal, proud progressive, as you said. But I wasn't agreeing with everything I was hearing from either sort of quote unquote side.</p>
</details>

我为10月7日的受害者哀悼。我担心人质。我也为加沙的破坏，特别是不断攀升的死亡人数感到痛心，这些数字几乎达到了难以想象的高度。数万人丧生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the more I thought about it, the more I kept coming to this idea that I was in the middle. I was mourning the victims of October 7th. I was worried about the hostages. I was also devastated by the destruction in Gaza and especially the deaths and the the the numbers were mounting to almost well to unimaginable heights. Tens of thousands of people killed.</p>
</details>

我理解以色列政府需要做出回应。但随着事态的拖延，我开始将这场战争视为过度反应，我不同意以色列政府的行动，但同时，我也没有将以色列这个国家一笔勾销，认为它不配存在，或者将所有以色列人都视为怪物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I understood the need for the Israeli government to respond. But as things dragged on, I began to see the war as an over response, and I was disagreeing with the actions of the Israeli government, but at the same time, not writing off Israel as a country that doesn't deserve to exist. Or all Israelis, as you know, monsters.</p>
</details>

我关心巴勒斯坦人。我支持巴勒斯坦，但我鄙视哈马斯。这就是我得出“我处于中间”这种感觉的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I care for Palestinians. I'm pro-Palestinian, but I despise Hamas. So that's how I came to this feeling that I was in the middle.</p>
</details>

然后是“人道主义”这个词，我知道，考虑到所有发生的恐怖事件，这个词听起来很荒谬。但我一直认为，在成为其他任何身份之前，我首先是一个人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the term humanitarian, which, you know, I realise is, you know, sounds ludicrous when you consider all of the all of the horrible things that have happened. But I kept thinking of myself as being the human before I'm anything else.</p>
</details>

在成为犹太人之前，我是一个人。在成为一个在以色列有家人的人之前，我是一个人。在成为一个记者之前，我是一个人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm a human being before I'm a Jewish person. I'm a human being before I'm someone who has family in Israel. I'm a human being before I'm a journalist.</p>
</details>

所以，这就是我如何得出“处于人道主义中点”这个想法的，即承认并哀悼各方的悲剧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so that's how I sort of came to this idea of being in the humanitarian middle, recognising and mourning the tragedy on all sides.</p>
</details>

### 来自各方的反馈与仇恨的蔓延

我猜，处于中间意味着你也会收到来自各方的反馈。你能告诉我你从专栏文章和这本合集中收到的一些反馈吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I imagine being in the middle means that you are also getting feedback from either side. Can you walk me through some of the some of the feedback that you've received from your columns and from this compilation?</p>
</details>

嗯，我不会提及那些不适合播出的反馈，但我确实听到了很多。我收到了很多反馈，并且还在继续收到。其中很多都充满激情。人们像我一样，带着自己的感受来写作。他们非常沮丧，而且他们也常常带着自己的立场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I'll stay away from the feedback. That would not be safe for broadcast, but I listen. I have received a lot of feedback and continue to. A lot of it is very passionate. People are writing as I was with their feelings. They are so upset. They are and they often come to it with from a side as well.</p>
</details>

我曾遇到过来自双方的人，他们都对我非常非常不满。我曾遇到过犹太人因为我批评了本雅明·内塔尼亚胡和以色列政府而感到不满。我也遇到过那些自认为是支持巴勒斯坦的人（但我再次强调，我也认为自己是支持巴勒斯坦的），他们觉得我对以色列不够严厉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I've had people very, very upset with me from both sides. I've had Jewish people upset that I have called out Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli government. I have had people who are, you know, pro-Palestinian. But again, I consider myself pro-Palestinian who have felt that I wasn't hard enough on Israel.</p>
</details>

我收到了很多长篇的信件，人们解释他们的立场，解释他们正在经历什么。我真的被所有这些信息所影响，直到现在还在收到。其中一些非常恶毒，我努力去忽略和忘记那些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And very long missives from people explaining where they come from, explaining what they were going through. And I was affected, really affected by all of those notes that I still continue to get. Some of them were very, very nasty, and those I tried to dismiss and forget about.</p>
</details>

我想谈谈我们现在所处的这种氛围。**反犹太主义**（Anti-Semitism: 对犹太人的仇恨、偏见或歧视）和**反穆斯林仇恨**（Anti-Muslim hate: 对穆斯林的仇恨、偏见或歧视）正在上升。举几个例子：**多伦多**（Toronto: 加拿大安大略省首府）的一所全女子小学曾遭到枪击，**安大略省**（Ontario: 加拿大省份）的**奥沙瓦**（Oshawa: 加拿大安大略省城市）也有一所犹太学校遭到袭击。一名穆斯林妇女在一次围攻中头巾被强行摘下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I want to pick up on sort of the climate that we're in right now. Anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim hate is on the rise. A couple of examples. There was the all girls elementary school in Toronto that had been targeted, the Jewish one that was targeted with gunshots in Ontario and Oshawa. A Muslim woman had her hijab forcibly removed during a swarming.</p>
</details>

这样的例子在双方都有无数。我想更好地理解，在你看来，这会带来什么后果？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There are countless examples on either side of this, and I want to get a better understanding. In your view, what are the consequences of this?</p>
</details>

这太可怕了。不仅是这些事件本身，还有从反犹太主义的角度来看待它们。我只能谈论我所了解的，因为我显然没有经历过反穆斯林仇恨，但我看到了，这非常令人不安。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It has been awful. Not only these events themselves, but then being told from an antisemitism perspective. This is what I can speak to because, you know, I haven't obviously experienced anti-Muslim hate, but I see it and it's very upsetting.</p>
</details>

但这些事件发生后，我们被告知，这不是真正的反犹太主义，而是**反锡安主义**（Anti-Zionism: 反对犹太复国主义，即反对以色列作为犹太人民族家园的权利）。我同意，你可以批评以色列，你可以批评以色列政府。这并不意味着你就是反犹太主义者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But then, you know, these events happen and then we're told, you know, it's not really anti-Semitism, it's anti-Zionism. And I agree, you can criticize Israel and you can criticize the Israeli government. And that doesn't mean you're being anti-Semitic.</p>
</details>

但毫无疑问，两者之间存在界限模糊。然后，我们被告知：“哦，当战争还在进行时，你却在抱怨这些？”我明白。我在加拿大自己的家里很安全。我不在战区，但同时，作为一名加拿大人，我不应该因为我的民族、种族或宗教而遭受仇恨言论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But there has been a bleeding, there is no question. And then, you know, to be told, oh, you're complaining about this when there's a war going on, I get it. I am very safe here in my home in Canada. I'm not in a war zone, but at the same time, I, as a Canadian, should not have to be subjected to hateful remarks that are based on my ethnicity or race or religion.</p>
</details>

我说“我的”，但我个人除了在电子邮件或网上受到攻击外，并没有受到人身攻击，但犹太社区和穆斯林社区所经历的数字是惊人的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I'm saying my but, you know, I haven't personally been attacked other than on email or online, but I the numbers are staggering in terms of what the Jewish community is experiencing and the Muslim community.</p>
</details>

作为一名犹太人，我感觉自己几乎成了人们故事的“储存库”。有一段时间，我几乎每天都会收到电子邮件，人们向我讲述那些令人不安的故事，我无法总是把它们写出来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I as a Jewish person was I felt almost like I was a repository for people's stories. There was a point when I was getting, you know, emails almost every day, people telling me these stories that were so upsetting and I couldn't always write about them.</p>
</details>

我只写了其中很少一部分，但我真的深受影响。我想说的是，对于那些旁观者，那些既不是穆斯林也不是犹太人，不必为此担心的人，我认为，将这些事情不公平地驳斥为“小事”，感觉就像是**煤气灯效应**（gaslighting: 一种心理操控形式，通过否认事实或扭曲现实，使受害者怀疑自己的记忆、感知或理智）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I wrote about just a very few of them, but I was really affected by it. And I want to say that, you know, for the other people, like the bystanders who are seeing this, who are not Muslim or who are not Jewish and don't have to worry about it, I think, to be to dismiss it as unfair and to dismiss it as not a big deal feels like gaslighting.</p>
</details>

我必须说，在所有联系过我的非犹太人中，当发生可怕事件时，总是有一位穆斯林女性，一位我从未谋面的作家，她总是非常关心我的状况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I have to say, of all the people who have reached out to me who are not Jewish about, you know, how I'm doing when there's a terrible event, it's a Muslim woman, another writer who I've never even met in person.</p>
</details>

但我们在10月7日之后开始了电子邮件往来，她总是那么关心我的状况。这在非常黑暗的时期里，是一束小小的亮光。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But we started an email correspondence after October 7th, who was always been so concerned about how I'm doing. And that has been one little bright light in a very dark time.</p>
</details>

### 针对性抗议与和平的呼吁

今年，**多伦多**通过了一项**气泡区法**（bubble zone bylaw: 限制在特定敏感区域（如礼拜场所、学校）附近进行抗议活动的区域性法规），限制了城市中礼拜场所、日托中心和学校周围的抗议活动。你在一篇专栏文章中谈到，在早期，抗议活动发生在医院周围，你对这种针对性抗议有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This year, Toronto passed a bubble zone bylaw restricting protests around places of worship, daycares, schools in the city. One of your columns you talk about in the in the early days, protests happening around hospitals, what are your thoughts on on targeted protests?</p>
</details>

针对领事馆、大使馆、政府机构进行抗议？请便。但请不要针对礼拜场所。我的意思是，我甚至不需要解释为什么那是不对的。请不要针对儿童学校。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Target consulates, embassies, government entities? Please do not target houses of worship. That is. I mean, I don't even think I need to explain why that's not right. Please don't target kids schools.</p>
</details>

在多伦多，我有侄女和侄子就读一所犹太日校，每次我去探望，那里都有一个巨大的指挥所，因为安全措施是必需的。当我在我居住的**温哥华**（Vancouver: 加拿大不列颠哥伦比亚省城市）参加犹太教**高圣日**（High Holy Days: 犹太教赎罪日和新年期间的一系列重要节日）时，我必须像在机场一样通过安检。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, I have great nieces and nephews who attend a Jewish day school in Toronto, and every time I visit, there's a huge command post out there because the security is required. When I went to synagogue here for the in Vancouver, where I live for the High Holidays, I had to pass through security like I was at the airport.</p>
</details>

这不是我们应该被大喊大叫或被抗议的对象。如果你想在以色列领事馆或美国领事馆抗议，请尽管去。但请考虑一下。在你让一个本应安全的地方变得不安全之前，请仔细考虑一下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is not. We're not the ones who should be yelled at or protested. If you want to protest at the Israeli consulate, go ahead or the American consulate. But please think about. Think about it before you, you know, make make a place that should be safe, a place that feels unsafe.</p>
</details>

在你的书中，你谈到了很多公开信。你自己也写了一封，是写给本雅明·内塔尼亚胡的。你希望通过那封公开信实现什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In your book, you talk a lot about open letters. You yourself write one, and it is directed to Benjamin Netanyahu. What were you hoping to accomplish with that open letter?</p>
</details>

嗯，我不认为本雅明·内塔尼亚胡会读它。我从未想过他会读它，但那封信是在绝望、焦虑和沮丧中写成的。沮丧可能是最恰当的词。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I don't think Benjamin Netanyahu was read it. I never thought he was going to read it, but it was written out of desperation, anxiety, despair. That's probably the right word.</p>
</details>

恳求内塔尼亚胡先生停止战争。我知道不仅仅是内塔尼亚胡的责任。是哈马斯在10月7日发动了袭击，但他们是一个恐怖组织，而他领导的是一个所谓的民主政府。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Begging Mr. Netanyahu to stop the war. And I know it's not just Netanyahu. It was Hamas that attacked on October 7th, but they are a terrorist group, and he leads a supposedly democratic government.</p>
</details>

所以这就是我直接写信给他，恳求他停止加沙的杀戮，恳求他同意停火，并敞开心扉接受**两国方案**（two-state solution: 解决以巴冲突的提议，即建立一个独立的巴勒斯坦国与以色列国并存）。我相信这是解决这场绝对噩梦的答案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that's why I was writing to him directly imploring him to stop the killing in Gaza, imploring him to agree to a cease fire and to open his heart to a two-state solution, which I believe is the answer to this absolute nightmare.</p>
</details>

### 对和平未来的希望

又过了一年。我最后一个问题是，马莎，你对和平计划有什么希望？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And here we are, another year later. And my last question to you, Marcia, is, you know, what are your hopes for a peace plan?</p>
</details>

哦，这取决于具体哪一天，我的希望有多大。实际上，我仍然相信两国方案是可能的。这是我最终的希望。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, depends on the day. How hopeful I am. Actually, I still believe that a two-state solution is possible. That is my ultimate hope.</p>
</details>

实现它不会容易，但我确实认为它是可能的。自这场战争开始以来，它从未如此必要。我认为这里的答案是，犹太人拥有联合国在大屠杀后承诺给他们的国家，而巴勒斯坦人也拥有他们同样被承诺的国家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's not going to be easy to achieve, but I do think it's. It is possible. It has never been more necessary than since this war began. I think the answer here is for Jews to have the state they were promised by the UN after the Holocaust, and for Palestinians to have the state they were also promised.</p>
</details>

巴勒斯坦人应该拥有自己的国家、自己的土地、自决权、和平与安全、食物和教育，以及每个人都应享有的所有权利。我还想说，除非巴勒斯坦人也拥有这些，否则以色列无法真正自由、安全和有保障。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the Palestinians deserve their own state, their own land, self-determination, peace and security and food and education and everything that every person should have a right to. And I would also suggest that Israel cannot be truly free and secure and safe until Palestinians have this, too.</p>
</details>

所以，这就是我的希望。它可能只是空中楼阁，可能有些过于乐观，但我会坚持下去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that's my hope. It might be pie in the sky. It might be Pollyanna-ish, but I'm holding on to it.</p>
