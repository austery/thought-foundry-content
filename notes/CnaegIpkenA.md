### AI加速与工作模式变革

**Jason Calakanis**: 各位，欢迎回到全球第一播客《All-In Podcast》。我是Jason Calakanis，今天我们有满满的议程。好的，各位先生，第一个话题：AI加速。这对AI来说是重要的一周。2月9日周一，**《哈佛商业评论》（HBR）**发表了一项新研究，表明**AI工具**会强化工作强度，但并不会减少工作量。两名**加州大学伯克利分校（UC Berkeley）**的研究人员在一家拥有200人的科技公司进行了八个月的实地考察。所以，这是一家公司的经验。他们发现，使用AI的员工工作节奏更快，承担的任务范围更广，并且工作时间延长。员工们报告说感觉生产力更高，但也感到更多的压力和倦怠。萨克斯，你对这项研究有什么看法？显然，这只是一家公司的经验，但它确实与我的一些经历相符。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: All right, everybody. Welcome back to the number one podcast in the world, the all-in podcast. With me again, the core 4, the original quartet, David Sachs, David Friedberg, Chimath Polyhapatia. I'm Jason Calakanis, and we have a very full docket today. All right, topic one, gentlemen. AI acceleration. It was a big week for AI. New study published on Monday, February 9th, in the **HBR, Harvard Business Review**, suggesting that **AI tools** intensify work but do not reduce it. Two **UC Berkeley** researchers spent eight months embedded at a 200 person tech company. So, this is one company's experience. What they found, employees who use AI worked at a faster pace, took a broader scope of tasks, and extended work into more hours of the day. workers reported feeling more productive, but they also felt a little more stress and burnout. Saxs, your your hot take here, your quick take on this study. Obviously, it's just uh one company, but it does track, I think, some of my experiences.

</details>

**David Sachs**: 好的，有几点。第一，你可能还记得今年的预测节目中，我最反主流的观点是AI会增加**知识工作者**的需求，而不是让他们失业。我认为在这项**加州大学伯克利分校**的研究中，你看到了这种情况发生的原因：因为使用这些工具的员工，就像你说的，他们工作更快，承担了更广泛的任务，最终每天工作时间更长。所以他们做了更多的工作，而不是更少，甚至付出了更多的努力，而不是更少。不是因为他们被要求这样做，而仅仅是因为他们更有动力。我认为他们更有动力是因为他们的工作得到了提升，对吧？他们能够将更多**琐碎的任务**卸载给AI，这让他们的工作更有目的性和意义。所以，我认为我们正在从一些人，我想也许**Jensen**称之为**基于任务的工作（task-based jobs）**，转向**基于目的的工作（purpose-based jobs）**。我认为员工的一个关键技能将是为自己和他们的**AI代理**构建工作的能力。能够做到这一点的员工将比那些不能做到的人生产力高得多。这让我想到第二点，我认为今年对于这些工具的早期采用者，也就是所谓的**AI原生代（AI natives）**员工来说，有一个巨大的机会来向雇主展示他们的价值。他们将能够完成更多工作，他们将看起来拥有超能力。他们将是会议中那些能够把以前需要几天才能完成的任务，在两小时内完成的人，无论是演示文稿还是电子表格。人们会惊讶于他们完成这些事情的速度，因为他们将熟练地与AI协作。所以，我认为这里有一个巨大的机会。本周有一篇**Matt Schumer**撰写的文章《Something Big Is Happening》走红，他谈到了这种对**AI早期采用者**开放的职业机会。这让我想到第三点，我认为今年你将看到AI在企业中大规模应用，不仅仅是**聊天机器人**，还有**代理**。但我认为这将是由下而上推动的。它将由这些早期采用者员工进入工作场所，带来这些**消费级AI工具**，开始在工作中使用它们，而不是自上而下的倡议。我认为许多大型企业正在进行自上而下的公司转型倡议，CEO们已责成团队研究如何使用AI，如何通过AI改造业务。这些倡议将需要数月时间。他们将研究应该使用哪些工具，他们将进行RFP（提案请求）。我认为这最终会非常缓慢。当这些事情缓慢进行时，我认为这些早期采用者员工将通过再次将这些工具从下而上引入工作场所，使转型成为既成事实。所以，我认为就像你看到**消费级SaaS工具**在企业中从下而上普及一样，你也将看到**消费级AI工具**在企业中从下而上普及。我认为这最终将成为今年的重要主题之一。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sachs**: All right. Well, a few points here. Number one, as you may recall on the prediction show for this year, my most contrarian belief is that AI would increase demand for **knowledge workers**, not put them out of business. And I think you see in this **UC Berkeley** study, the reason why that might be the case is because the employees who use these tools, like you said, they worked faster. They took on a broader scope of task. They actually ended up working more hours in the day. So they did more work, not less, and even more effort rather than less. Not because they were required to, but just because they were more motivated. And I think they were more motivated because their work was getting upleveled, right? They're kind of able to offload uh more menial tasks to AI and it made their work more purposeful and meaningful. So I think we're kind of moving from what some people I think maybe **Jensen** has called um **task-based jobs** to **purpose-based jobs**. And I think a key skill of employees is going to be the ability to structure work for themselves and their **AI agents**. And the employees who can do that are going to be far more productive than those who can't. That kind of brings me to point number two, which is that I think there's a tremendous opportunity this year for employees who are **early adopters** of these tools, who are, you know, so-called **AI natives**, to demonstrate their value to their employers. They're going to be able to get a lot more done. They're going to appear to have superpowers. They're going to be the people in meetings who can take an assignment that would have taken days before and get it done in 2 hours. whether it's a presentation or a spreadsheet, people are going to be shocked at how quickly they can get these things done because they're going to be fasile at working with AI. So, I think there's a big opportunity there. And there was an article that went viral this week by **Matt Schumer** called "Something Big Is Happening" where he talked about this career opportunity that's going to be available to kind of **AI early adopters**. And I think that brings me to my third point, which is I think that you're going to see massive **enterprise adoption of AI**, not just **chatbots**, but **agents** this year. But I think it's going to be driven by the bottom up. It's going to be driven by these early adopter employees coming in to their workplaces, bringing in these kind of **consumerized AI tools**, start using them at work as opposed to top- down initiatives. I think there's a lot of top- down company transformation initiatives that are happening in large enterprises where the CEO has tasked a team with figuring out how to use AI, how to transform their business with AI. Those initiatives are going to take months. They're going to be studying what tools they should use. They're going to be doing RFPs. And I think it's ultimately going to be very slow. And while those things are trudging along, I think there's going to be these early adopter employees who just make the transformation of Feta Comple by again bringing these tools into the workplace from the bottom up. So, I think in the same way that you saw **consumerized SAS tools** spread from the bottom up in enterprises, I think you're going to see **consumerized AI tools** spread from the bottom up in enterprises. And I think it'll ultimately be one of the big themes this year.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 我完全同意。尼克，把我发的那个推文放出来。我发了一条推文，获得了200万次浏览。我基本上说，听着，如果你在过去两年被**亚马逊（Amazon）**或**微软（Microsoft）**裁员了，那就去学习**OpenClaw**，然后自动化你以前的工作。展示你知道如何使用这些工具。回到你的老板那里说：“嘿，我想回来自动化一切”，或者去初创公司。我认识的每家初创公司都在招聘这个职位，也就是知道如何构建和管理**代理**的人。目前还没有针对这个职位的招聘信息或头衔。我们应该想出这个人做什么，但它以前被称为**提示工程师（prompt engineer）**。现在它不再仅仅是**提示工程（prompt engineering）**了。它是管理、教育并将工作卸载给一个代理，然后确保它们确实在做。现在感觉我的组织里有20个人，其中有4个人专注于此。我会说他们的杠杆作用是其他16人的10到20倍。所以现在我正在从最技术性的员工到最不技术性的员工的斜坡上努力，并试图让每个人都采用并为他们创建一个代理。这可能需要六个月，但当我们做到时，我认为我们相对于竞争公司的杠杆作用将是10倍。举个例子，在播客领域，萨克斯，我们现在让它通过播客寻找最佳时刻，或者你可以给它一个时刻，它就会为你剪辑片段并放到**Google Drive**中。所以想象一下，我们都在，我不知道，我们的小组聊天中，你说：“哦，从上一集，你能给我一个第3分钟到第6分钟的片段吗？”然后它就直接在你的**iPhone**上。它就在群聊里。砰。没有人需要去寻找。它只是剪辑了。这就是它正在做的工作。然后我们让它查看我们的**YouTube**统计数据。我们让它查看我们的**Instagram**或**TikTok**统计数据，然后告诉我们哪些片段最容易走红，哪些评论最多，然后给我们如何让它们更走红的策略。这真的很奇怪，因为它提出了非常棒的建议，并消除了知识工作者所做的所有报告工作。查马特，你对此有什么看法？我知道你已经部署了**软件工厂**，我认为这显然与实时发生的这场革命是一致的。过去几周，随着**Claude Opus 4.6**的发布，**ChatGPT Codex**的发布，以及我连续做了七期播客的**OpenClaw**革命，进展都非常大。查马特，你有什么想法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Couldn't concur or agree more. Nick, throw up that tweet I did. I I did a tweet and it got 2 million views. Basically, I said, listen, if you got laid off by **Amazon** or **Microsoft** over the last two years, just learn **OpenClaw** and automate your previous job. Show you know how to use these tools. go back to your boss and say, "Hey, I want to come back and automate everything or go to startups." Every startup I know is hiring for this position, which is somebody who knows how to build and manage **agents**. There is no job wreck for this yet or a title. We should come up with what this person does, but it it used to be called **prompt engineer**. It's no longer just **prompt engineering**. It's managing and educating and offloading work to an agent and then making sure they're actually doing it. And right now it feels like the people in my organization have four of them who are focused on this out of 20. I would say that their leverage is between 10 and 20x the other 16. So now I'm going down the slope of employees from you know most technical you know to least and trying to get each one of them to adopt and create an agent for them. We'll pro it will probably take six months but when we do I think our leverage versus a competing firm is going to be 10x. As an example, in the podcasting space, Sax, we now have it going through podcasts looking for the best moments or you can just give it a moment and it will clip the clip for you and put it in the **Google Drive**. So imagine we were all in, I don't know, our little group chat and you said, "Oh, from the last episode, can you get me a clip of minute 3 to minute 6?" And then it's just on your **iPhone**. It's just in the group chat. Boom. Nobody has to go find it. It just clips it. That's the kind of work it's doing. And then we have it looking at our **YouTube** stats. We have it looking at our **Instagram** or **Tik Tok** stats and then trying to tell us which clips are going the most viral, which ones have the most comments and then giving us strategies to how to make them go more viral. It's really weird because it's coming up with really great suggestions and taking eliminating all the reporting work that knowledge workers do. Chimat, you have a take on this? I know you've deployed the **software factory** which is I think um you know aligned with obviously this revolution happening in real time. Last couple of weeks have been pretty big with **claude opus 4.6** coming out uh **chat GPT codeex** coming out lot of advances and obviously the **open claw** revolution that I've now done seven podcasts on in a row. What are your thoughts Jamal?

### AI数据隐私与本地部署的回归

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: 我认为现在有两个非常有趣的问题。第一个问题是，我今天早上发了推文，**本地部署（on-prem）**是新的**云（cloud）**吗？这听起来很奇怪，甚至可能吗？但我们自2008年以来一直将所有东西迁移到云端，因为存在规模经济。它创造了更好的利润，更低的运营成本（opex）和更低的资本支出（capex），因为你可以与其他公司共享基础设施。这就是**AWS**和**GCP**如何建立起如此庞大的业务。但与之相反的是，在AI革命中，我怀疑公司将为生存而战。我认为，公司是否应该允许其优势、机密和专有信息自然地泄露到外部，而不是通过**本地部署**获得控制权，这一点非常不清楚。这是一个非常重要的问题。我说的这一切是什么意思？一旦你使用这些工具，公司就很难控制其数据随后如何被使用。这意味着，如果我给了你Jason一份非常重要的战略文件PDF，或者一份PowerPoint演示文稿，或者一个非常关键的模型，而你正在用这些模型之一进行查询。如果你只是使用**ChatGPT**的主线实例，你就会将所有这些提示和响应元数据泄露回**ChatGPT**，泄露回**Gemini**，泄露回**Claude**。公司对此无能为力。如果你使用一组代理来处理所有这些信息，所有这些代理的轨迹都会返回给这些模型构建者。这对于某些人来说可能不是问题，但我怀疑对于其他人来说这是一个严重的问题，他们只是还没有发现。当他们意识到这是一个问题时，企业将不得不决定，我是放弃并继续在云端以共享体验运行所有这些东西，还是承担以更协调的方式在本地部署中运行这些东西的增量成本，而我拥有控制权？那将是一个疯狂的转变，完全回到我们20、30年前的状态。这不是一个显而易见会发生的事情。所以这是第一点。第二点，我也发了推文。有一个非常有趣的裁决，关于这些云环境内部发生的事情，一位法官表示没有**律师-客户特权（attorney-client privilege）**，并确认一旦你开始使用这些工具，所有这些内容都将成为完全的公共领域材料。如果你把这两件事放在一起，它会给企业带来一系列非常有趣的问题。你将需要AI才能生存。但如果你使用今天存在的公共端点工具，你将放弃你今天拥有的所有控制权、所有安全性、所有机密性以及跟踪和控制员工使用这些工具的能力。唯一的解决方案是让钟摆完全摆回来，拥有**私有供应网络（private provision networks）**，这会增加成本，但如果你因为AI节省了一大笔钱，也许一切都会平衡。这是我目前正在努力解决的大问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: I think there are two open questions that I find really interesting right now. The first question is, I tweeted it this morning, but is **on-prem** the new **cloud**, which is weird to think that that could even be possible, but we've spent since 2008 migrating everything to cloud because there were these economies of scale. And it created better margin and lower opex and lower capex because you could essentially share infrastructure with other companies. And that's how **AWS** and **GCP** have built such gargantuan businesses. The counterpoint to that though is that in the AI revolution, companies I suspect will be fighting for their lives. And I think it's very much unclear whether it makes sense for a company to allow the natural leakage of their edge and their **confidential and proprietary information** out into the wild versus the control that they would get if they ran on prim. That's a really important question. What do I mean by all that? Once you use these tools, it is very difficult for a company to be able to control how their data is used subsequently thereafter. Meaning if I gave you Jason a PDF of some really important strategy document or a PowerPoint deck or a really critical model and you're interrogating it with one of these models. If you're just using **chat GPT** the mainline instance of it you're leaking all of that prompt and response metadata back to **Chat GPT** back to **Gemini** back to **Claude**. And there's nothing a company can do about that. If you're using a set of agents to act on all that information, all those agent traces are going back to these model builders. That may or may not be a problem for some, but I suspect it is a deep problem for others and they just haven't uncovered it yet. When they realize that that is a problem, the enterprise will have to decide, do I just give up and keep running all of this stuff in the cloud in a shared experience or do I bear the incremental cost of running this stuff in a more coordinated manner that I control on prem and that would be a crazy shift just to completely go back to where we were 20 and 30 years ago. That's a non so obvious thing that may happen. So that's number one. And then number two, I also tweeted this. There was this really interesting ruling around what happens inside these cloud environments, which was a judge saying there is no **attorney client privilege** and confirming that once you start to use those tools, all of that stuff is complete public domain material. If you put these two things together, it creates a very interesting set of questions for enterprises. You will need AI to survive. But if you use the tools as they exist today at a public endpoint, you will give up all control, all security, all confidentiality that you today have and the ability to follow through and control what your employees do with it. The only solution is to have the pendulum swing all the way back and have **private provision networks**, which increases cost, but then if you save a bunch of money because of AI, maybe it all balances out. That is the big question that I'm wrestling with right now.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 很好的见解。我有一些关于本地部署的想法，因为我目前正在这样做。弗里德伯格，你对我们现在所处的这个时刻有什么看法，人们说它发生得更快，而且它变得**递归（recursive）**了。对于那些以前没听过这个词的观众来说，递归显然是一个花哨的词。这些模型和代理可以出去改进自己的工作。所以，在它们为你做了一些工作或任务之后，你可以让另一个代理说：“嘿，这是如何做得更好，或者去学习这些新技能。在过去30天里使用这项技能，去寻找过去7天或30天使用这个工具的最佳实践，并让自己变得更好，每天凌晨1点这样做。”弗里德伯格，你对我们现在所处的时刻有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Good insights there. And I have some thoughts on the um onrem because I'm actually doing it right now. Freeberg, your thoughts on this moment in time when we have people uh saying it's happening faster and it's become **recursive**. Recursive obviously fancy word for those in the audience who haven't heard it before. Just these models and these agents can go out and improve their own work. So after they do some work or a job for you, you can have another agent say, "Hey, here's how to do it better or go learn these new skills. Go use this skill last 30 days to go find the last seven days or 30 days of best practices with this tool and make yourself better and do that every night at 1:00 a.m. What are your thoughts, Freedberg, on the moment in time we are in right now?"

</details>

**David Friedberg**: 嗯，我认为历史上的想法是关于**递归模型开发（recursive model development）**，我们将不断改进实际模型，我们正在等待一个上下文窗口，你可以将模型反馈给它自己。所以，你实际上是在不断地重新训练模型，而且可能情况是**输出是递归的（output is recursive）**，这最终产生了每个人都在等待的效果。所以，这有点令人惊讶。我看到很多在AI领域工作了一段时间的计算机科学家，我认为，对我们现在所处的这个时刻感到有点惊讶，我们仅仅通过使输出递归就看到了模型性能上如此令人难以置信的进步。所以，让我们看看它能走多远。杰克，你还痴迷于**OpenClaw**吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Friedberg**: Well, I think the thinking historically was that it was going to be about **recursive model development** where we were going to continuously improve the actual model and we were waiting for a context window where you could feed the model back to itself. So, you're effectively retraining the model continuously and it may be the case that the **output is recursive** and that turns out is having the effect that everyone was waiting for. So, it's kind of a surprise. I saw a lot of computer scientists that have worked in AI for some time, I think, be a little bit surprised about this moment that we're in that we're seeing such incredible strides in model performance just by making the output recursive. So, let's see how far it goes. Are you still obsessed with **OpenClaw**, Jac?

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 我是。我们现在已经看到，我们风险投资公司内部每周有5%到10%的工作正在转移到**OpenClaw**上。我们称它们为**复制人（replicants）**。你可以把它们想象成**角色（personas）**。所以我们现在有三四个这样的复制人。我们给它们一个**Notion**账户，一个**Slack**账户，我们还给它们一个**Google Docs**账户。它们有自己的电子邮件。我认为所有这些技术一直都在这里。或者说，也许在过去的6个月里，有真正好的模型问世。但没有公司会把“王国钥匙”交给这些代理，让它们真正代表你行事。为什么？因为它们不想承担责任，如果它把你的**比特币密钥**或**密码**发送给其他人。所以，为了使用这些，你必须信任它们。如果你信任它们并监控它们，结果是令人难以置信的。查马特，就你所说，我们也启动了**Max Studios**。我们让**Kimmy**在上面运行。我们正在将所有工作转移到这些复制人上，然后它们将使用**Kimmy**处理大多数简单的工作，这是免费的。然后它们将使用**Claude 4.6 Opus**来协调事务。弗里德伯格，现在我们有四个复制人，我们还创建了**OpenClaw Ultron**，这是一个元复制人，它管理着其他四个，并检查它们的工作。它整天与它们交流它们正在做什么，然后进行总结。我们正在为每个复制人构建技能。所以其中一项技能是进行深度研究。其中一项技能是能够进入我们的销售数据库，该数据库位于**PipeDrive**中。我们获得的收益是，我能够审查我的**雅典娜助手（Athena assistant）**所做的一切，我能够将大约30%的雅典娜助手的工作交给复制人，让雅典娜助手从事更高层次的工作。我想说，在普通的投资团队个人中，我们现在大约有20%的工作是由代理实时完成的。最棒的是，它们不会忘记工作。它们不会犯错误。所以一旦你设置好，你就不需要清单了。它们每次都能完美地完成工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: I am. We have now seen that every week 5 to 10% of the work we're doing inside of our venture firm is being moved over to **OpenClaw**. We call them **replicants**. You can think of them as **personas**. So we now have three or four of these. Uh we give them a **notion** account, a **Slack** account, and we give them a **Google Docs** account. They have their own email. And I think all of this technology was here all along. It was really or maybe for the last 6 months, let's say, really good models out there. But no company would give the keys to the kingdom to allow these agents to actually act on your behalf. Why? because they don't want to be responsible if it ships your **Bitcoin keys** or your **passwords** to somebody else. So, in order to use these, you have to trust them. And if you trust them and then you are monitoring them, the results are unbelievable. We uh have also to your point Chamath fired up **Max Studios**. We have **Kimmy** on them. We are moving all of the work onto these and then they'll use **Kimmy** for most of their easy jobs, which is free. Then they will use **claude 4.6 opus** to orchestrate things. We also now that we have four of them freedberg we've created **openclaw ultron** which is one meta replicant that is managing the other four and it checks their work. It talks to them all day long about what they're doing and then summarizes it. And we're building skills into each one of these. So one of the skills is like doing deep research. One of the skills is being able to go into our sales database which is in **pipe drive**. The gains we're getting I was able to go through everything my **Athena assistant** was doing and I was able to take about and I know Chimath you have an **Athena assistant** too. I was able to take maybe 30% of the Athena assistants work and give it to the replicant that let the Athena assistant work on higher level stuff. I would say on the average investment team individual, we now have probably 20% of their work being done by agents in real time. And the best part about it is they don't forget to do work. They don't make mistakes. So once you put this in, you don't need to have checklists. They just do it perfectly every single time.

</details>

**David Friedberg**: 太疯狂了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Friedberg**: Crazy.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 而且它们还在工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: And they work.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 查马特，这太疯狂了。所以现在我正在构建，我一直在和**Benny Offal**聊很多，因为他有**Slackbot**。**Claude**有**Co-work**，但它们都没有“王国钥匙”。所以，我正在做的是升级到**Slack**的企业版。查马特，你职业生涯中我认为可能是第二大投资。那是一项多么惊人的投资啊。嗯，是第四大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: It's nuts, Jamal. So now I'm building and I've been talking to **Benny awful** a lot cuz he's got **Slackbot**. **Claude's** got **co-work**, but none of them have the keys to the kingdom. So, what I'm doing is I'm upgrading to the enterprise version of **Slack**. Shamat, you're I think probably your number two investment in your career. What an amazing investment that was. Um, it's number four.

</details>

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: 第四大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: Number four.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 好的。听着，继续努力。对你来说是前五大投资。我正在升级到最高级别，并且我正在将我们组织中的每一条**Slack**消息都摄入，然后我正在升级并为我们组织中的每一封电子邮件提供**API密钥**给**Ultron**。它们将了解组织中发生的一切。这进展的速度令人难以置信。最后，插播一下，我正在投资**OpenClaw**领域的10家初创公司，每家12.5万美元，让他们来参加加速器。如果你正在做这方面的工作，请访问**openclaw.co**，给我发电子邮件，告诉你在做什么，因为我们现在想投资至少10到20家这样的公司。这是我们公司100%的重点。这太疯狂了。你们认为企业何时会对此感到巨大的恐慌，并说：“哇，我们正在将所有最重要的信息泄露到外部。”但萨克斯，就你所说，那个勤奋的人为了领先，突然使用一个开放的端点来改进一个演示文稿。不知何故，所有这些东西都泄露到外部了。他们发现后，很快就会有一个恐慌的时刻。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Okay. Listen, keep grinding. Top five investment for you. I'm upgrading to the highest level and I'm ingesting every single **Slack** message and then I'm upgrading and giving the **API key** for every single email in our organization to **Ultron**. They will know everything going on in the organization. It is mind-blowing how fast this is going. And then finally, just a plug, I'm investing in 10 startups in **OpenClaw** space, 125K each to come to the accelerator. If you're doing work on this **openclaw.co**, email me what you're doing cuz we want to invest in in at least a 10 or 20 of these companies right now. Uh this is the 100% focus of our firm. It is insane. When do you guys think enterprises have a huge freakout around all of this and say, "Wow, we're leaking all of our most important information out into the wild." But Sachs, to your point, the industrious person trying to get ahead all of a sudden is using an open endpoint to like make a deck better. and somehow all of that stuff is out in the wild. They find out people are going to have a freakout moment here soon.

</details>

**David Sachs**: 我认为有一个巨大的机会来将**OpenClaw**这样的东西企业化、安全化等等。我在**Craft**的一位合伙人实际上创建了一个新工具，叫做**Lobster Tank**，它是**OpenClaw**的一个版本，但它有一些企业级安全措施。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sachs**: I think there's a big opportunity to take something like **OpenClaw** and make it enterprisegrade and secure and all that kind of stuff. One of my partners at **Craft** actually created a new tool called **Lobster Tank**, which is a version of **Open Claw** that's got some enterprise security wrapped around it.

</details>

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: 这就是我的意思。**本地部署**又回来了。它会发生的。它会发生的。这是成本节约，再加上我是否愿意将我们组织中的所有秘密，每一项**知识产权**都交给**Sam Altman**，他每年必须赚取10亿美元才能跟上他的开支，对吧？他将构建每一个应用程序。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: This is what I mean. **On-prem** is back. It's going to happen. It's going to happen. It's cost savings plus do I want to give all of the secrets in our organization, every piece of **intellectual property** to **Sam Alman** who's got to make a billion dollars a year to keep up with his spend, right? He's going to build every application.

</details>

**David Sachs**: 我们不要谈**Sam**。如果我是**GEICO**，

**David Sachs**: Let's not make it about **Sam**. Do I, if I'm **GEIGO**,

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: 我想让我的所有**精算师**在一个开放的**大型语言模型（LLM）**实例中使用我们所有专有的、私密的和机密的数据进行风险定价吗？答案是否定的。这很明显。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: want to have all of my **actuaries** using all of our proprietary, private, and confidential data on risk pricing in an open instance of an **LLM**? The answer is no. That's obvious.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Yeah.

</details>

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: 所以现在的问题是，你如何适应这种情况？在这种情况下，你如何实际生成**token**？在这种情况下，你如何进行推理？这是一个非常昂贵的技术问题。它不一定复杂，但它确实是技术性的。这将增加运营成本（opex），因为你回到了一个你曾说过不再有意义的地方。如果你听说一家公司是**本地部署**，感觉非常过时。但AI可能是你无法承受不进行本地部署的原因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: So now the question is how do you adapt to that? How do you actually generate **tokens** in that kind of a situation? How do you reason in that kind of a situation? That is a very expensive technical problem. It's not necessarily complicated, but it is technical. That will bloat the opex because you're going back to a place that you had said didn't make sense anymore. It felt very antiquated if you ever heard a company was on prem. But AI may be the reason where you can't afford to be not on prem.

</details>

**David Sachs**: 是的。而且它也会在你的桌面上，因为解决这个问题的一个方案就是给每个员工一台真正强大的**台式机**，能够运行本地**大型语言模型**，这目前需要一台拥有512GB内存的**Mac Studio**，或者将两台串联起来。这就是人们正在做的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sachs**: Yeah. And it's it's going to be on your desktop, too, because one of the solutions to this is just giving each employee a really powerful **desktop** that is capable of running a local **large language model**, which right now takes a **Mac studio** with 512 gig or or daisy chaining two of them. And that's what people are doing.

</details>

**David Friedberg**: 还记得那些**VAX终端**吗？我认为你实际上可能会看到这种想法的复兴。所以你有一台中央计算机，然后你有一堆**哑终端（dumb terminals）**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Friedberg**: Remember these **vax terminals**? I think that you could actually see a resurgence of that idea. So you have a centralized computer and you have a bunch of **dumb terminals**

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: y

</details>

**David Friedberg**: 并且你有一个**命令行界面（CLI）**，所以你可以通过这种方式与它交互。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Friedberg**: and you have a **CLI** and so you can interact with it that way

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 但它仍然将所有东西保留在内部。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: but again it keeps everything inside the

</details>

**David Friedberg**: 但你也可以在云端启动自己的实例并运行它。

**David Friedberg**: but you could also you could also fire up your own instance in the cloud and just run it

</details>

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: 规模化太昂贵了。例如，**8090**是**Bedrock**的前20名客户。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: too expensive at scale like for example **8090** is a top 20 customer **bedrock**

</details>

**David Friedberg**: 它已经太贵了，因为所有这些开销。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Friedberg**: it's too expensive already as it is because of all this overhead

</details>

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: 因为他们的利润。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: because of their margin

</details>

**David Friedberg**: 因为**AWS**内部所有那些你必须付费才能获得裸机访问的无稽之谈。所以你去了**CoreWeave**。好吧，没问题。但**CoreWeave**告诉你什么？他们是一家优秀的企业。A，全是训练。B，你面临的情况是，你所拥有的太多东西必须在未来得到保证，因为对他们来说，按现货价格定价没有意义。如果你按现货购买，你只会遇到这些激增。你无法处理。所以今天没有一个有意义的解决方案。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Friedberg**: because of all the nonsense that's inside of **AWS** that you have to pay for in order to just get access the bare metal. So then you go to **Cororeweave**. Okay, fine. But what does **Cororeweave** tell you? They're an excellent business. A, it's all training. B, you have the situation where too much of what you have has to be guaranteed into the future because for them, it makes no sense to price it on spot. And if you buy on spot, you just get these surges. You can't deal with it. So there is no solution today that makes any sense.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 查马特，这绝对正确。我简单地用一些数字来支持一下。我们使用我们的代理，每个代理每天花费300美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: It's absolutely correct, Jam. I'll just put some numbers behind it briefly. We with our agents hit $300 a day per agent.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 使用**Claude API**，几乎是即时完成的，那大概只完成了10%或20%的工作。这意味着每个代理每年花费10万美元。我们正达到一个地步，我们现在基本上必须说，我们愿意给最好的开发人员多少**token预算**？然后，如果你将所有人的总和加起来，你可以清楚地看到一个趋势，你会觉得，等一下，现在他们至少需要比另一个员工的生产力高两倍，这在我的业务中正在积极发生，因为否则我就会没钱了。是的，这是一个非常有趣的趋势，你不会听到其他人谈论，但**token**何时会超过员工的工资？因为你即将达到那个点。我即将达到那个点。我认为超级明星开发人员已经达到了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: using the uh **Claude API** like instantly and that was like doing maybe 10 or 20%. That's a h 100,000 a year per agent. We're getting to a place where we have to basically now say what is the **token budget** that we're willing to give our best devs and then if you aggregate it across all people you can clearly see a trend where you're like well hold on a second now they need to be at least 2x as productive as another employee that is actively happening inside my business because otherwise I'll run out of money. Yeah, this is a very interesting trend that I you you're not going to hear anybody else talk about, but when do **tokens** outpace the salary of the employee? Because you're about to hit it. I'm about to hit it. I think superstar developers are already there.

</details>

**David Friedberg**: 是的，我认为普通员工可能最多是10%到20%。更有可能的是，他们花费几千美元。普通的非技术员工可能在几百到几千美元之间。但就你所说，趋势才是最重要的。是的。所以除非我们在以今天十分之一的成本生成输出**token**方面有巨大的飞跃，我怀疑我们会有的。所以请大家再忍耐一段时间，因为我认为**英伟达（Nvidia）**、**Grock**、**谷歌（Google）**和**AMD**都受到激励，要大规模提高能源密度并大幅降低**token成本**。这将会发生，但这不会改变趋势，也不会改变保密性的激励。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Friedberg**: Yeah, I think the rank and file is probably 10 20% max. More than likely, they're spending a few thousand. The average non-technical employee is probably in the hundreds to low thousands. But to your point, the trend is what matters. Yeah. So unless we have some gigantic leap forward in generating output **tokens** at onetenth the cost of what they are today, which I suspect we will have. So bear with everybody for a while because I think **Nvidia** and **Grock** and **Google** and **AMD**, they're all incentivized to massively ramp up the energy density and massively push down the **token cost**. That's going to happen, but it doesn't change the trend and it doesn't change the incentives on confidentiality.

### 预测市场与内幕交易

**David Friedberg**: 各位，我们来谈谈**预测市场（prediction markets）**。上周末，它们在**超级碗（Super Bowl）**期间达到了临界规模。**Kshi**上投注超过10亿美元，**PolyMarket**上投注7亿美元，总投注额近20亿美元。媒体一直在关注市场操纵、**内幕交易（insider trading）**以及围绕预测市场（至少在这个规模上是世界上的新事物）的所有这些完全有效的问题。有两个具体的例子来自中场秀。一个一天大的匿名**PolyMarket**账户正确预测了20个中场秀投注中的17个，包括**Lady Gaga**、**Ricky Martin**的特别出场，但它只盈利了1.7万美元，金额很小。然后另一个在比赛前不到24小时创建的账户正确投注了**Bad Bunny**的歌单。今天早上**《华尔街日报》（Wall Street Journal）**发表了一篇文章，题为“以色列士兵被指控使用**PolyMarket**投注袭击”。以色列逮捕了几人，包括预备役军人，他们被指控使用机密信息对**以色列军事行动**进行投注。引用原文：“该账户在休眠6个月前赢得了超过15万美元，上个月恢复交易，投注以色列何时会袭击伊朗。”**PolyMarket**数据显示该账户名为**Rico Suave 666**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Friedberg**: Let's talk about **prediction markets**, gentlemen. They hit critical mass this past weekend at the **Super Bowl**. More than a billion bet on **Kshi**, 700 million on **poly market**, almost two billion dollars in wagering. The media has been obsessing a bit about **market manipulation**, **insider trading**, and all these issues that are totally valid to discuss around prediction markets, which are something new in the world, at least at this scale. two specific examples uh from the halftime show. A day old anonymous **Poly Market** account correctly predicted 17 out of 20 halftime show bets, including the special appearances by **Lady Gaga**, **Ricky Martin**, but it only profited 17K, a tiny amount. And then another account created less than 24 hours before the game correctly bet on **Bad Bunny** set list. **Wall Street Journal** this morning with an article titled, "Israeli soldiers accused of using **PolyMarket** to bet on strikes. Israel arrested several people, including Army Reserve, for allegedly using classified information to place bets on **Israeli military operations**." Quote, "The account in question rad in more than 150,000 in winnings before going dormant for 6 months. It resumed trading last month, betting on when Israel would strike Iran." **Poly market** data shows the name of the account **Rico Suave 666**.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: **Rico Suave**。这个账户的名字是**Rico Suave 666**。我想那也是你在拉斯维加斯酒店里用过一段时间的化名。**Rico Suave 666**。这些平台当然受到**CFTC（商品期货交易委员会）**的监管。但你知道，这里有一些关于社会如何适应这个新平台的问题。这是**Kali**的CEO在**CNBC**上谈论这个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: **Rico Suave**. The name of the account **Rico Suave 666**. I think that's also the alias that you were using in Vegas for a little while there uh at your hotel. **Rico Suave 666**. The platforms are regulated of course by the **CFTC**. But you know, questions here uh about society getting used to this new platform. Here's **Kali's** CEO uh talking about this on **CNBC**.

</details>

**Kali's CEO**: 假设有一个摄影师碰巧在彩排期间在体育场内。你可以说这就像酒店里有人在CEO演讲前看到了彩排一样。这些人通常可能需要签署**保密协议（NDA）**，因为公司会担心这些问题。但在这种情况下，他们可能不会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kali's CEO**: Let's say there's a a cameraman happens to be in the stadium during the rehearsals. You could argue that would be like somebody at a at a hotel who sees a rehearsal of a CEO given a presentation prior. Those guys would have normally probably had to sign **NDAs** by the company because they would be worried about these issues. But in the context of this, they probably wouldn't.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 要么是这信息可以公开，那没问题。要么是这信息不能提前公开，并且已经传达给工作人员了，对吧？摄影师或舞者。你不知道第一首歌会是什么，那不是公开的，也不是每个人都提前知道的。这有点像**超级碗**的惊喜。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: It's either one of two cases. Either this information can be public and that's okay. Or it's information that cannot be public beforehand and that's communicated to the staff, right? The cameraman or the dancer. The reason why you don't know what song is going to be played first that's not public and not everybody knows beforehand. It's a little bit of a surprise **Super Bowl**.

</details>

**Kali's CEO**: 是的。但这并非非实质性信息。这不是不能分享的实质性信息。你通过将其放在这个投注平台上使其成为实质性信息，但他们没有义务说我们不会告诉任何人我们的开场阵容，因为在其他地方可能会因此赚钱，而现在正在对此进行投注。责任不在他们身上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kali's CEO**: Yeah. But but it's not nonmaterial. It's not im it's not material information that can't be shared. you're making it that by putting it on this betting platform, but they have no obligation to say we're not going to tell anybody our opening lineup because there might be money made on this other place that's now betting on this. That's not the responsibility is not on them.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 你对社会如何适应这些新平台以及它们在思想市场中代表的意义有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Your thoughts just broadly on what I consider society getting used to these new platforms and what they represent in the marketplace of ideas.

</details>

**David Friedberg**: 我认为问题是，这真的是**内幕交易**吗？如果你和我进行一场私下投注，而我知道一些关于你的事情，我有一些优势，我与你打赌，这公平吗？政府应该在监管方面发挥作用吗？这有点回到**证券监管（securities regulation）**，即所有东西都需要注册，然后存在**内幕信息（insider information）**的概念。这是一个真正的挑战，也是一个真正的问题，即如何在保持任何交易的开放平台机会的同时，努力减轻人们所说的这些交易中的**内幕信息**风险。我们的小组聊天中有一张很好的图表，显示了账户的分布。少数账户拥有大量资金并获得几乎所有利润，而许多账户资金很少，很快就被烧光了。它们实际上没有优势。所以那些拥有大量资金的账户，它们通常只在有优势的地方进行交易，它们在那里做市。它们实际上有**套利（arbitrage）**，或者说是**高手（sharps）**，它们吞噬了所有资本。所以如果你是一个像这样的市场，你可能也需要深思熟虑，随着时间的推移，如果你平台上的所有客户，所有用户都在不断进行没有优势的交易，而所有资本，所有流动性都来自那些有优势并有效利用**内幕信息**进行交易的账户，那么你可能会耗尽所有客户。所以我认为这些东西最终会自食其果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Friedberg**: I think the question is, is it really **insider trading**? If you and I were making a side bet and I knew something about you and I had some edge or some advantage and I made a bet with you, is that fair? Should the government have a role in regulating that? This kind of goes back to **securities regulation** that everything needs to be registered and then there's this concept of **insider information**. It's a real challenge and a real question on keeping the open platform of opportunity for trading on anything while also trying to mitigate the risk of what people call **insider information** in these trades. There's a good chart that I think we talked about in our group chat that shows the distribution of accounts. There's a few accounts that have a huge amount of money and make almost all the profits and then a lot of accounts that have very little amount of money and they get burnt through very quickly. They actually don't have an edge. So the the accounts that have a lot of money, they generally only trade in things where they have an edge where they make markets. They actually have an **arbitrage** or yeah **sharps** and they eat up all of the the capital. So if you're a marketplace like this, you probably also want to be thoughtful about the fact that over time you could burn and churn through all of your customers, all of the users on the platform if they're constantly going to be making uh trades where they simply don't have an edge and all the capital, all the liquidity is coming from the accounts that do have an edge and effectively trade off of inside information. So just be that these things end up eating themselves up. I don't

**Jason Calakanis**: 查马特，我们以前有过**InTrade**，我相信你还记得，我不知道那是不是在21世纪初。这个想法一直存在，但不知为何现在才流行起来。你对这些平台对社会的价值有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Shabbath man, we had **in trade**. I'm sure you remember that in I don't know if that was in the early 2000s. This idea has been out there but it has clicked right now for some reason. What are your thoughts broadly speaking on the value of these platforms to society?

</details>

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: 首先，我们来定义一些术语。在投注中，有两种人。一种是**高手（sharps）**，他们对将要发生的事情有更好的了解，然后是**普通玩家（squares）**，也就是其他人，他们是炮灰。在传统的市场，比如**体育博彩市场（sports betting market）**，有一些边缘案例，你会试图操纵比赛或打假拳或控制比分，高手会参与其中。但这样做越来越难，因为**体育联盟**会通过分析密切研究这些事情，以确保这种情况永远不会发生。但你得到的是对将要发生的事情有更聪明理解的人，以及对将要发生的事情理解不那么聪明的人。**预测市场**的问题在于，它不仅仅是这些。会有这些事情。但也会有这些纯粹关于**内幕信息**的基本市场。问题是监管机构或社会能对此做些什么？我认为答案是不多。原因在于，如果你试图监管它，它看起来就像一个**证券市场**。我认为问题在于这些东西太流动、太动态、太短暂，无法像证券一样立法。那么为什么会发生这些事情呢？因为有太多这样的**预测市场**可以被这样操纵。有人知道一些别人不知道的事情。而且没有办法仲裁。这在**证券市场**中也曾存在。现在我可能会让很多人非常不高兴。在2000年，我们引入了**REG FD（公平披露规定）**这项法律。**REG FD**的目的是什么？它基本上是说，如果你是首席财务官，你不能与个别股票经理交谈，告诉他一些你没有告诉其他所有人的事情。本质上，**内幕信息**以前不是非法的。我不会说它是合法的。我只会说它以前不是非法的。你打电话给你的朋友，他说：“嘿，你怎么样？”他说：“伙计，这个季度太棒了。”你就会去买股票。从21世纪初开始，这变得非法了。以前存在利用这种信息套利的网络。现在，这是一个**沃伦·巴菲特（Warren Buffett）**在**REG FD**前后回报的例子。现在，你看到了什么？当这种信息共享合法时，他的回报是市场回报的两倍。而一旦它变得非法，你基本上必须像其他人一样在相同的优势下行动，他的回报就回到了市场回报。他创造了零阿尔法。事实上，他可能在边际上损失了一点。所以这是世界上最好的投资者。这就是当你拥有**信息对称（information symmetry）**时会发生的事情。所以这只是为了解释市场在存在**不对称（asymmetry）**时才会繁荣。数十亿美元将通过不对称赚取。今天的**预测市场**，除非它们被监管到不复存在或关闭，否则将看起来像自由的股票市场，我们除了选择不投注之外别无他法，因为否则你将会有大量**高手**利用大量**普通玩家**，我认为这就是最终状态。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: Let's define some terms first. So in betting there are two kinds of people. There are the **sharps** who know what's actually going to happen with a better edge and then there are the **squares** which is everybody else and they are grist for the mill. And in a traditional market like a **sports betting market** there have been edge cases where you try to throw a game or throw a fight or shave points and the sharps are involved in that. But it's increasingly harder and harder to do because the **sports leagues** analytically are studying these things so closely to make sure that that never happens. But what you get are people with a smarter sense of what's going to happen and people with less of a smart sense of what's going to happen. The thing with **prediction markets** is it's not just that. There will be those things. But then there are going to be these fundamental markets that are purely about **inside information**. And the question is what can a regulatory body or a society do about that? And I think the answer is not much. And the reason is is that if you try to regulate this, it looks like a **securities market**. And I think the problem there is that these things are too fluid and too dynamic and too ephemeral for them to be legislated like a security. And so why are these things happening? It's because there's too many of these **prediction markets** that can be manipulated this way. Somebody knows something that somebody else doesn't know. And there's no way to arbitrate that. This used to exist in the **securities market**, too. And this is where now I'm going to get a lot of people really upset with me. In 2000, we introduced the law called **REGGG FD**. And what was the point of **REGG FD**? It was basically that if you're a CFO, you cannot talk to an individual stock manager and tell him something that you then don't tell everybody else. Essentially, **inside information** that used to be not illegal. I won't say that it was legal. I would just say that used to be not illegal. You call your buddy, he says, "Hey, how you doing?" He goes, "Man, Quarter was a blockbuster. You would go and buy the stock." And starting in the 2000s, it became illegal. And there used to be these networks of information arbitrage that that took advantage of this. Now, this is an example of **Warren Buffett's** returns pre and postreg. Now, what do you see? His returns were double the market returns when this kind of information sharing was legal. And the minute that it became illegal and you had to basically act on the same edge as everybody else, his returns went to the market return. He generated zero alpha. In fact, he probably on the margins lost a little bit. So this is the single best investor in the world. This is what happens when you have **information symmetry**. So it's just meant to explain that markets thrive when there's **asymmetry**. billions and billions of dollars will be made in asymmetry. The **prediction markets** today unless they are regulated out of existence or shut down will look like the stock market free and there's nothing we can do except choose not to bet it because otherwise what you're going to have are a ton of sharps taking advantage of a ton of squares and I think that's the end state.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 查马特，这些平台的存在对社会是好是坏？你对此有什么看法？这些**预测市场**中有一部分是关于社会良好运作的，而**内幕信息**的使用可以更快地揭示真相，我认为这有价值，特别是如果它能揭露**腐败**或**不当行为**。所以，如果人们在此过程中赚钱，而这是促使人们绕过**举报人法律（whistleblower laws）**或其他方式来揭示真相并更快地传播真相的激励，那可能对社会有益。现在，还有许多其他情况，有些人会建立一个他们了解并能控制的市场，而其他人却一无所知。那不好。但不幸的是，无法辨别一个**预测市场**被创建时是A类还是B类。所以，你必须决定，是更快、更准确地理解这些时事更重要，还是不重要。我认为这就是必须做出决定的地方，也是政客和社会需要决定的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Jim, why is it good or bad for society that these exist? You have a take on that? There are a certain percentage of these **prediction markets** that are about the well functioning of society and the use of **inside information** gets to the truth faster and I think that has value especially if it uncovers **corruption** or **misdeeds** and so if people make money along the way and that's the incentive that it takes for folks to work around what would otherwise be **whistleblower laws** or something else to get to the truth and get it out there faster. That probably benefits society. Now, there's a bunch of other things where some people will just set up a market that they know about and that they can control that other people aren't unaware. That's not good. But unfortunately, there's no way to discern when a **prediction market** gets created whether it's A or B. And so, you have to decide whether it's more important that you can understand these current events faster with more accuracy or not. And I think that's where this decision has to come to and that's what politicians need to decide and society needs to decide.

### All-In播客“流动性”峰会

**Jason Calakanis**: 好的。我们很高兴我们正在举办另一场活动。是的。来自你们**All-In**朋友们的新活动。**Besties**正在举办一场新的会议，一个务虚会，一个峰会，在葡萄酒之乡，5月31日至6月3日。它叫做**流动性（liquidity）**。这是为**资本配置者（capital allocators）**、**有限合伙人（LPs）**和**普通合伙人（GPs）**准备的。查马特，也许你可以谈谈我们对这次活动的愿景。

This is for **capital allocators** and **LPs** and **GPS**. Chamatop, maybe you could talk a little bit about the vision we have here for the event.

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: 每年都会举办一些能赚钱的会议。我给你举几个例子。所有顶级的**市场交易员**每年都会被邀请参加一个叫做**Iris**的活动，在那里你会在大批观众面前展示你最好的多头或空头想法，你可以是**债务交易员**、**信用交易员**，也可以是**股票交易员**。我做过几次。**Aman**做过。**David Einhorn**做过。**Cliff Robbins**做过。这些都是令人难以置信的地方，你支付1万美元的门票，如果你采纳那些投资组合，它们往往表现得非常好。另外，还有一些**投资银行**组织的会议，这些会议是非公开的，不对公众开放，他们会邀请他们最大的交易员到一个房间，让他们每个人花几分钟时间展示他们最好的公开股票多头和空头想法。然后还有**投资银行**为**私营公司**举办的同等会议，最好的快速增长的私营公司会出席，CEO们上台进行演讲。所有这些活动都是封闭的。我想把它们彻底开放。那么我们会做什么？我们将召集**公共市场**中最好的投资者，最好的**对冲基金经理**，最好的**私人市场投资者**，最好的**增长型投资者**，最好的**信用投资者**，以及代表数万亿美元资本的最大批**有限合伙人**，以及科技领域增长最快、最重要的公司的CEO们。在几天的时间里，我们将进行一些演讲。我们将有最好的想法。我们将建立关系。可能会因此产生一些投资。我们将关闭整个**扬特维尔（Yountville）**。我们将关闭**法国洗衣店（French Laundry）**。我们将关闭所有这些地方。它将成为我们为期两天的游乐场，我们将在那里建立关系，分配资本，并可能因此赚取一些钱。所以，你需要申请。我们将为一些可能无法进入的人进行一些分配。我们将为一些可能需要筹集资本并扩大规模但能向我们展示良好回报的**新兴经理人**进行一些分配。随着时间的推移，我们将找到一种方法来增加其中很多，并使其越来越公开。但我们基本上将把所有我曾参与过的、在封闭房间里进行的这些事情整合起来，并将其开放。

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: There are a handful of conferences that happen every year where money is made. I'll give you a couple of examples. All the top **market traders** have been invited to this thing called **Iris** every year where you go in front of a large audience, present your best long or short idea and you can be a **debt trader**, a **credit trader**, you can be an **equities trader**. I've done it several times. **Aman** has done it. **David Einhorn** has done it. **Cliff Robbins** has done it. These are incredible places and you pay like $10,000 a ticket and if you take those portfolios, they tend to do really well. Separately, there are conferences that **investment banks** organize that are off the record, not publicly accessible where they ask their biggest traders to come to a room, and they'll give them each a few minutes to present their best long and short ideas of public stocks. Then there are these equivalent conferences that **investment banks** do for **private companies** where the best fast growing private companies show up and the CEOs get on stage and they give presentations. All of these things have been closed. I would like to blow that wide open. So what will we do? We will convene the best investors in **public markets**, the best **hedge fund managers**, the best **private market investors**, the best **growth investors**, the best **credit investors**, and the largest cohort of **LPs** representing trillions of dollars of capital, and the CEOs of the fastest growing and most important companies in technology. And what we will do over the course of a few days is we'll have some presentations. We'll have best ideas. We'll build relationships. There may be some investments that may happen as a result of that. We're going to shut down all of **Yianville**. We're going to shut down the **French Laundry**. We're going to shut down all of it. And it'll be ours for a two-day playground where we will build relationships, allocate capital, and maybe make some money as a result. So, you need to apply. We will make some allocations to some folks that may not otherwise get in. We'll make some allocations to **emerging managers** who may need to raise capital and scale up but can show us good returns. And over time, we'll find a way to increase a lot of this and make it more and more publicly accessible. We But we are going to essentially take all of these things that I've been a part of that have been in closed rooms and we're going to put them together and open it up.

**Jason Calakanis**: Good. I like it. I like it. You know, all great events, all great art is has some perspective behind it and we're excited to have your sharp perspective behind this one. **Liquidity** May 31st to June 3rd. **allin.com/events**. Okay, let's move on to our next topic. The new **CBO** report is out. Freeberg, you said we are in a **debt death spiral**. The **Congressional Budget Offer** released its long-term budget forecast on Wednesday, February 11th. Here are the numbers. 2026 deficit is 1.9 trillion. And that's nearly 6% of **GDP**, much higher than the 3% **GDP** target we heard from **Scott Besson** on this podcast. **Social Security**, I talked about that before. Freeberg Trust runs out in 2032, uh, one year earlier than previously expected. That's obviously going to trigger all kinds of discussions around **austerity measures** that folks will not like. The debt will now grow from 31 trillion today to 56 trillion in 2036. So, it is not stopping, folks. We are looking at an average of 2.5 trillion per year from 2026 to 2036. Also, currently we're at 120% **debt to GDP**. House Committee on Budget expects it to be 135%. So slightly up in 2036. For comparison, Japan is 237, Singapore 176, Venezuela 164, the Greeks 154, UK 94. 20 years ago, our **debt to GDP** was but 60%. Here's a direct quote from the report. The fiscal trajectory is not sustainable. Okay, Dr. Doom, what do you think? Freeberg, this is your story, your chance to shine.

**David Friedberg**: 嗯，没有达到3%**GDP**赤字的目标。

**Jason Calakanis**: There he is.

**David Friedberg**: 如果你看看这些假设，其中一个关键假设是短期利率（大部分债务的再融资方式）被模型设定在3.1%左右。但如果利率攀升到接近5%，正如我过去提到的，仅仅使用当前的债务水平，每年就会增加6500亿美元的利息支出，这将使利息支出几乎达到每年2万亿美元，仅仅是支付过去的债务利息。而且由于我们正在运行赤字，新的利息支出每年都会增加债务。所以债务会不断增加，仅仅通过增加过去债务的利息。因此，这变成了我们多次强调的**死亡螺旋**。所以这份报告中没有任何东西能改变我对前景的看法。这相当可怕。嗯，我想说，我越来越担心的一个触发点是，如果民主党赢得中期选举，并且在2028年白宫出现民主党总统，我认为会有一个更大的问题，那就是所有**州和地方的债务**。我们已经谈过**社会保障**看起来几年内就会耗尽资金。所以，他们将需要印更多的钱来资助**社会保障**的义务。嗯，他们不太可能大幅削减**社会保障**，因为如果他们那样做，没有人会当选，如果他们承诺那样做，也没有人会当选。嗯，在州和地方层面也有类似的问题，那就是**养老金义务**。我们已经广泛讨论过这个问题。**加利福尼亚州**有近1万亿美元的**未兑现养老金义务**，需要支付给其公共退休人员或即将退休的公共雇员。如果到2028年，众议院由民主党控制，总统也是民主党，你很可能会看到这种义务的联邦化，这意味着联邦政府将介入以救助或支持这些州和地方政府，因为否则将会出现一种真正的经济危机。所以当你把这种即将到来的负债加到这份**CBO报告**中（该报告在未来5到10年内不包括任何这些内容），我认为那可能不仅仅是压垮骆驼的最后一根稻草，而是压垮骆驼的混凝土。这是我最担心的事情。城市层面的**社会主义运动**，现在越来越多地在州层面，以及我们应该预期**美元**会发生什么，以及它与联邦支出、联邦赤字和联邦债务的关系之间存在着深刻的联系，这些都将在未来几年以这样或那样的方式将彼此拖入困境。所以，你知道，这就是我目前更担心的事情。看起来，如果很难削减开支或让国会批准我们需要的预算削减以摆脱这个**债务死亡螺旋**，想象一下，如果我们在未来几年必须救助或联邦化州和地方债务以及州和地方**养老金义务**，情况会变得多么糟糕。那将非常糟糕。所以，这是我最担心的事情。是的。

**David Friedberg**: And if you look at the assumptions, one of the key assumptions is that the short-term interest rate, which is largely how a lot of the debt is getting refinanced, is modeled to be around 3.1%. But if rates climb closer to 5%, as I mentioned in the past, just using the current debt levels, it adds another $650 billion a year of interest expense, which takes interest expense almost up to$2 trillion a year just paying the interest on the past debt. And because we're running a deficit, that new interest expense increases the debt every year. So the debt goes up and up and up just by adding interest on past debt. And so this becomes the **death spiral** that we've kind of highlighted many times. So there's nothing in this report that I think changes the outlook. It's pretty scary. Um, I'll say that the trigger point that I'm getting more and more concerned about, if the Democrats win the midterms and you end up with a Democrat in the White House in 2028, I think that there's a bigger problem at foot, which is all of the **state and local obligations**. We've talked about **Social Security** looks like it's going to run out of money in a few years here. And so, they're going to need to print a lot more money to fund **Social Security** obligations. uh it's very unlikely they're going to make a massive cut to social security because no one will get elected if they did that and no one will get elected if they promise to do that. Um and there's a similar problem at the state and local level which is that there's **pension obligations**. We've talked about this extensively. **California** has nearly a trillion dollars of **unfunded pension obligations** to its public retirees or public employees that are going to retire. If you end up with a Democratc controlled House and a Democrat president in 2028, you'll very likely see a federalization of that obligation, meaning that the federal government will step in to bail out or support those state and local governments because otherwise there's going to be a real kind of economic crisis a foot. So when you add that liability coming to hit this **CBO report**, which doesn't include any of that in the next 5 to 10 years, I think that could be not just the straw that breaks the camel's back, but the concrete that breaks the camel's back. And that's the thing I'm most worried about. There is a deep connection between what's going on with the **socialist movements** at a city level and now increasingly at a state level and what we should expect to happen with the **US dollar** and how it relates to **federal spending** and **federal deficits** and **federal debt** and these are going to be dragging each other into a bad place in the next couple of years one way or the other. So, you know, that's kind of what I'm more worried about at this point. It seems if it's very hard to cut spending or get Congress to approve budget cuts that we need to save ourselves from this **debt death spiral**, imagine how much worse it's going to be in the next couple of years if we have to bail out or federalize state and local uh debt and state and local **pension obligations**. It's going to be really nasty. So, that's the thing I worry about the most. Yeah.

**David Friedberg**: 正如我们所讨论的，我将再次提出，我将请我在政府部门工作的同事考虑这个想法，你知道，如果我们能找到一种方法宣布破产，以重组州和地方层面的财政义务或**养老金义务**，我们可能有一条出路，但除此之外，那将加剧这个联邦问题。萨克斯，你对**CBO报告**和这个**债务死亡螺旋**有什么看法？

**David Friedberg**: as we've talked about and I'll bring it up again and I'll ask my colleague who works in the administration to think about this idea that you know if we can find a way to declare bankruptcy to restructure the the fiscal obligations or the the **pension obligations** that sit at the state and local level we may have a way out but short of that uh that's going to pile onto this this federal problem. Sax, your thoughts on the **CBO report** and this uh **death spiral, debt death spiral**.

</details>

**David Sachs**: 嗯，我们都同意联邦支出、赤字和债务的问题，我们都对此感到担忧。然而，关于**CBO研究**，我只想指出，其中一个关键假设是**CBO**预测实际**GDP**今年在2026年只会增长2.2%。考虑到去年第三季度我们增长了4%以上，第四季度的初步数字是5%以上，这是一个非常低的假设。而且我认为我们对今年**GDP增长**的所有预测，在我们做预测节目时，都是5%以上。所以2.2%是一个相当低的数字。然后他们预测2026年之后会放缓到1.8%。所以再次，这些都是非常微薄、贫血的增长假设。如果你相信所有这些投资于**AI基础设施**的**资本支出（capex）**会带来回报，那么增长率可能会高得多。而这最终我认为是摆脱**债务螺旋**的方法，我们需要强劲的增长。没有这一点，我们将无法摆脱这个问题。所以，看，我认为如果你相信增长，那么情况就不那么严峻了。你知道我会怎么做吗？嗯，我的意思是，如果我能挥舞魔杖，你想看的两个关键图表是**联邦净支出占GDP的百分比（federal net outlays as a percent of GDP）**。这来自**Fred**，对吧？然后你想看**联邦收入（federal receipts）**，也就是**税收收入占GDP的百分比（tax receipts as a percent of GDP）**。你只是不希望这两条线相差超过3%。我认为**Besson部长**说的就是，努力将**联邦赤字**减少到**GDP**的3%。历史上，**税收收入**一直在17%左右波动。而**联邦净支出**一直在20%左右波动。所以，如果你回到那个水平，我们就会处于相当好的状态。在**新冠疫情（COVID）**之前，我们的**联邦净支出**，也就是支出占**GDP**的百分比，大约是20%。但随后在2020年，由于所有**刺激措施**以及经济因**新冠疫情**而萎缩，它飙升到30%。我们从未完全回到那个神奇的20%的数字。现在，它正在23%左右徘徊。所以，我们比**新冠疫情**期间做得好得多，但仍然高出几个百分点。我的意思是，如果由我决定，我只会冻结**联邦支出**，直到经济增长到**联邦支出占GDP的百分比**达到20%的水平。然后你可以让**联邦支出**随着经济增长而继续增长。我们甚至没有谈论削减。我们甚至没有谈论缩小政府规模。我们只是在谈论限制增长率，直到经济的整体规模能够赶上它。但看，正如我们所知，让华盛顿同意这一点非常困难，因为华盛顿存在巨大的支出压力。不过，我还是要说一点，我的意思是，只是为了给本届政府一些赞扬，那就是**联邦就业水平**处于1966年以来的最低水平。所以在**特朗普总统（President Trump）**的第二个任期内，我们已经从大约300万联邦雇员减少到略低于270万。所以，你知道，超过30万联邦雇员被裁减了。我认为这是一个好的开始。我的意思是，你

**David Sachs**: Well, we all agree about the problem of federal spending and the deficit and the debt and we're all concerned about that. With respect to the **CBO study**, however, I'll just note that one of the key assumptions here is that **CBO** projects that real **GDP** will only grow by 2.2% this year in 2026. That's a very low assumption given that we grew by over 4% in Q3 last year and the preliminary number for Q4 was over 5%. And I think all of our predictions for **GDP growth** this year when we did our predictions episode was 5% plus. So 2.2% is a pretty low number. And then they predict that it's going to slow to 1.8% after 2026. So again, these are very meager anemic growth assumptions. And if you believe that all of this **capex** that's being invested in **AI infrastructure** is going to have a payoff then the growth rates could be a lot higher. And that ultimately I think is the way to get out of the **debt spiral** is we need strong growth. Without that we're not going to get out of this problem. So look I think that if you believe in growth then the situation is not quite as dire. You know what would I do? Well, I mean, if I could wave a magic wand, the two key charts you want to look at are **federal net outlays as a percent of GDP**. This is from **Fred**, right? And then you want to look at **federal receipts**, which is **tax receipts as a percent of GDP**. And you just don't want those lines to be more than call it 3% apart. I think that's what **Secretary Besson** said is try to reduce **federal deficits** to 3% of **GDP**. Historically, **tax receipts** have bounced around 17%. And the **federal net outlays** have bounced around 20%. So, if you get back to that, we'd be in pretty good shape. And we were before **CO** our federal net outlays, which means spending as a percent of **GDP** was around 20%. But then with **CO**, it bounced all the way up to 30% in 2020 because of both a function of all the **stimulus**, but then also the fact that the economy shrank because of **CO** and we've never quite gotten back to that magic 20% number. Right now, it's trending around 23%. So, we're doing a lot better than we did under **CO**, but it's still just a few percent higher. I mean, if it was up to me, I would just freeze **federal spending** until the economy grew to the point where **federal spending as a percent of GDP** is 20%. And then you could let **federal spending** continue to grow as the economy grows. And we're not even talking about cuts here. We're not even talking about shrinking the size of the government. We're just talking about limiting the rate of growth until the overall size of the economy can catch up with it. But look, as we know, it's very hard to get Washington to go along with that because there is just a lot of spending pressure in Washington. One thing I will say though, I mean, just to give some credit to the administration here, is that the level of **federal employment** is at the lowest level since 1966. So during uh **President Trump's** second term here, we've gone from roughly 3 million federal employees to a little bit under 2.7 million. So, you know, over 300,000 federal employees have been cut. I think that is a good start. I mean, you

**Jason Calakanis**: 顺便说一句，我认为这非常重要，需要暂停一下，让人们明白这并不是什么伤害性的解雇。他们失去了工作。但当人们从政府劳动力转移到私人劳动力时，他们变得更有生产力。他们正在创造促进经济增长的东西。理论上，他们也应该赚更多的钱。所以从经济角度来看，将劳动力从公共部门转移到私人部门是积极的。它也符合我的观点，从历史上看，我认为避免**社会主义螺旋（socialist spiral）**非常重要，如果你有太多人受雇于政府，那么不雇佣政府人员就变得不可能，这最终会变成事实上的社会主义。查马特，你对此有什么看法？显然，政府规模缩小是件好事，这些人变得更有生产力，进入私营部门。这是一个巨大的胜利。我们都同意，第一年10%的成绩很棒。嘿，也许未来两三年5%会更好，但债务仍然是个问题。嗯，你担心吗？你认为这里有解决方案吗？如果你掌权，你会怎么做？

**Jason Calakanis**: by the way. I think that's I think that's really important to just pause on just so people understand this isn't like some hurtful thing about firing people. They lose their jobs. But when people move from the government workforce into the private workforce, they become productive. They're making things that grow the economy. And theoretically, they should also make more money. So this is positive from an economic point of view to move the workforce from public to private. It also to my point historically I think it's very important to avoid the **socialist spiral** that if you have too many people employed by the government it becomes impossible to not employ people by the government and that becomes ultimately deacto socialism. Shimath your thoughts here obviously great thing that we're shrinking the size of the government those people becoming more productive going into the private sector. That's a big win. We all agree 10% great job in the first year. Hey, maybe 5% the next two or three years would be even better, but the debt continues to be a problem. Uh, are you worried? Do you think there's a solution here? What would you do if you were running the show?

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: 我认为你必须从更广阔的历史背景来看待这个问题。**债务与GDP之比**重要吗？这取决于很多因素，但大多数情况下，我认为它不重要。人们很容易对此感到不安。现在，当你印太多钱时，有些事情确实很重要，那就是**美元**的价值、出口的价值、进口的成本，以及如何实际保护你的收入和财富。那是另一个问题。这是一个回顾大约300年来世界上最大功能经济体的**债务与GDP之比**的历史。现在，你看到了什么？你看到的是一个趋势，你知道，如果你平滑掉战争的影响（顺便说一下，战争有一个奇怪的效果，首先会使**债务与GDP之比**升级，但随后会以积极的方式严重影响它）。**拿破仑战争（Napoleonic War）**、**法俄战争（Franco-Russian War）**、**第二次世界大战（World War II）**，这些事情在战争结束后都对降低**债务与GDP之比**产生了积极影响。但自1700年至今的总体趋势是向上和向右的。关键的观察是，它同步移动，这些是相对问题。所以如果整个世界都像这样同步移动，那么有一个论点可以成立，那就是你最终可能会达到300%、250%、200%的**债务与GDP之比**。但如果每个人都处于这个水平，那么情况并不会改变太多。真正的问题是，如果一个国家能够脱钩，并且其经济产出与所有其他国家有如此显著的不同。所以，我对整个**债务与GDP之比**的第一个看法是，我认为你必须把它作为一个整体来看待。另外，控制债务重要吗？绝对重要。但原因是为了其他方面，为了收入，为了**通货膨胀（inflation）**，为了所有那些影响你日常生活的非常实际的原因。我们对此了解多少？我们知道**特朗普总统**以巨大的授权当选，一方面是为了确保边境安全，另一方面是为了关注浪费、欺诈和滥用。在那方面，他做了什么？他任命了世界上最重要、最多产的私人商人作为他的先锋。结果呢？他们识别出了数千亿美元。但当需要国会采取行动来巩固这些削减时，他们几乎什么也没做。这说明，如果美国历史上最保守的国会都没有为白宫和国防部识别出的这些削减做太多工作，那么正如弗里德伯格所说，如果民主党控制众议院和民主党总统，情况只会变得更糟。那么我们必须做什么？我认为我们必须承认，如果**债务与GDP之比**持续同步移动，那么音乐在很长一段时间内都不会停止。这只是一个观察。我不是说它是对是错。这只是观察。但你必须找到对冲和拥有真正耐用资产的方法，因为这些经济体中使用的基础货币，即使是相对而言，也会剧烈波动，并直接跌落悬崖，这意味着它将侵蚀你为自己和家人创造的价值。我认为这是所有这一切中最重要的启示，那就是我们可能会看到**黄金**等东西随着时间的推移表现得更好，因为人们会担心他们以**美元**计价的资源的持久性。但对于所有其他计价资源来说，情况也会如此。但我认为**债务与GDP之比**，老实说，如果我是一个赌徒，它将相对地向200、300、400、500、600%发展，对于所有国家都是如此，因为我只是认为这些国家的政府沉迷于支出，除非有其他行星物种入侵地球，否则没有理由停止。

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: I think you have to take a broader historical context to this. Does **debt to GDP** matter? It depends on many things, but mostly I would say it doesn't matter. And it's very easy for people to get agitated about that. Now, there are things that matter when you print too much money, which is the value of the **dollar**, the value of exports, the cost of imports, and how to actually protect your earnings and your wealth. That's a different question. This is a historical look back from about 300 years of **debt to GDP** of the largest functioning economies in the world. Now, what do you see? What you see is the trend where you, you know, if you smooth it out for wars, which by the way has this weird effect of first escalating the **debt to GDP**, but then severely impacting it in a positive way. The **Napoleonic War**, the **FrancoRussian War**, **World War II**, these things all had positive effects on bringing **debt to GDP** once the war was over. But the general trend since 1700 to now is up and to the right. And the key observation is that it moves in unison that these things are relative problems. So if the entire world moves in unison like this there is an argument to be made which is that you could end up at 300 250 200% of **debt to GDP**. But if everybody is there nothing really changes that much. The real question is if one country is able to decouple itself and its economic output is so meaningfully different than everybody else's. So my first take on this whole **debt to GDP** thing is I think you have to look at it together as a group. Separately, is it important to contain the debt? Absolutely. But for these other reasons, for earnings, for **inflation**, for all of those very practical reasons that impact your daily lived life. And what do we know there? We know that **President Trump** was elected on a massive mandate to secure the border on one hand, but to look at waste, fraud, and abuse on the other. And on that side, what did he do? He drafted the most important and prolific private businessman in the history of the world to be his tip of the spear. And what happened? They identified hundreds of billions of dollars. But when it came down to it and Congress had to act to solidify these cuts, they haven't done much of anything. Which is a way of saying that if the most conservative Congress in the history of the United States has not done much to solidify these cuts that were identified by the White House and Doge, then as Freeberg said, it'll only get worse if there's ever a Democratic House and Democratic control. So what do we have to do? I think we have to just acknowledge that if **debt to GDP** continually moves in unison, the music isn't up for a very long time. That's just an observation. I'm not saying it's right or wrong. It's just the observation. But you got to find ways of hedging and owning real durable assets because the underlying currency that is used in these economies even on a relative basis will fluctuate wildly and just fall off of a cliff which will mean that it will erode the value that you have created for yourself and your family. That I think is the most important takeaway from all of this, which is we probably see things like **gold** do much much better over time because people will be afraid about the durability of their **dollar** denominated resources. But it will also be true for all these other denominated resources. But I think **debt to GDP** quite honestly if I had to be a betting man will trend into the 2 3 4 5 600 on a relative basis for all countries because I just think the governments of these countries are addicted to spending and there is no reason to stop safe of some other planetary species invading planet earth.

**David Friedberg**: 是的。还有一个问题是，**美联储（Fed）**的行动将如何影响过度赤字支出的能力。所以，如果**Kevin Warsh**真的想收紧**美联储的资产负债表（Fed's balance sheet）**，而**美联储**实际上是**国债（treasuries）**的第一线买家，这意味着他们正在印钱来资助政府支出，如果他们放慢或积极放慢并停止这样做，那么国会和政府将需要采取什么行动就存在一个真正的问题，因为正如你所知，如果**美联储**停止购买**国债**，**国债收益率（Treasury yields）**就会上升。如果**国债收益率**上升，这意味着现有债务的利息将开始上升。如果这种情况持续一段时间，短期收益率曲线从3%上升到4%，再到4.5%，再到5%，那么资助这种水平的赤字支出就会变得过于昂贵，因为利息支出将开始攀升并吞噬所有资金。所以我想，**Kevin Warsh**的问题是，如果他真的要削减**资产负债表**，那会对利率产生什么影响？那最终会迫使国会、迫使政府在支出方面做什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Friedberg**: Yeah. There's also a question of what **Fed** action will do to the capacity for excess deficit spending. So if **Kevin Worsh** really does want to tighten the **Fed's balance sheet** and the **Fed** is effectively the first in line buyer of **treasuries**, meaning they are printing money to fund the government spending and they slow down or actively slow down and stop doing that, then there is a real um kind of question on what action will Congress and the administration need to take because what will happen as you know if the **Fed** stops buying **treasuries**, **Treasury yields** will go up. And if **Treasury yields** go up, that means the interest on the existing debt will start to go up. And if that lasts for a period of time and you start going from 3 to 4 to 4 12 to 5% on the short end of the the yield curve, then it starts to become way too expensive to fund this level of deficit spending because the interest expense will just start to climb and eat it all up. So I think like the **Kevin Worsh** question is if he really is going to reduce the balance sheet, what's that going to do to rates? What's that going to ultimately force Congress, force the administration to do with spending?

**Jason Calakanis**: 嗯，你知道，我们正处于一个**消费驱动型经济（consumer-driven economy）**中，这个国家的**就业率（employment rate）**绝对是棒极了。所以，这里有三张快速图表。你知道，这是**职位空缺（job openings）**的数量。即使我们在2022年从1200万个职位减少到700万个职位，我们仍然有大量的职位空缺。然后如果你看看我们的**失业率（unemployment rate）**，它仍然处于我们一生中的历史低点。如果你出生在1970年，这已经是最好的情况了。它一直在4.456%左右。它略有上升，但仍然是我们一生中的最低点。最后，**就业参与率（employment participation rate）**，我们社会中工作和能够工作的人数。它在**克林顿（Clinton）**执政期间达到了68%左右的峰值，现在仍然很低，只有62%。我们仍然有人可以参与。所以，如果更多的人参与并从事这些工作，所有这些问题都将得到解决。他们为什么不从事这些工作呢？有时是地理位置不匹配。有时是技能不匹配，但很多时候是工作薪水不够高。所以如果你想通过关闭边境来赞扬**特朗普**，你减少了那些从事地下工作的人数，然后企业将不得不提高他们的**最低工资（minimum wage）**。他们将不得不提高他们的招聘工资，这可能会让那些7%左右的旁观者去从事这些工作。一个疯狂的预测。如果**特朗普**（他显然是一个民粹主义者，我前几天在推特上发了关于这个的推文，获得了近50万次或40万次浏览）决定提高**最低工资**，我不会感到惊讶。我不是说我支持或反对，但它目前低得令人难以置信，每小时7美元。显然，在不同的城市和州，它是15到20美元。但如果**特朗普**说我们将在未来三年每年增加1美元或2美元呢？这将非常受欢迎，它会让一些人离开旁观者，也许会从事这些工作。所以，这只是一个疯狂的预测，但我认为这是一种可能性，我认为他们目前会输掉中期选举。看起来我认为这是普遍的共识，他们未能解决这种可负担性问题。嗯，我认为大多数美国人会说，如果你提高**最低工资**，那会增加可负担性。你可以反驳说这只会导致**通货膨胀**，但我认为大多数美国人会相信这一点。所以，如果**特朗普**在那里采取行动，我不会感到惊讶，因为他时不时会采取这种**民粹主义行动**。

**Jason Calakanis**: Uh, you know, we are in a **consumer-driven economy** and the **employment rate** in this country is absolutely fantastic. So, just three quick charts here. You know, this is the number of **job openings**. We still have, even after we burned off uh in 2022 from 12 million to 7 million jobs, we still have a ton of jobs available. Then if you look at our **unemployment rate**, it's still at historical lows for our lifetime. If you were born in 1970, this is as good as it gets. 4.456 is what it's been. It's ticking up modestly, but still lowest of our lifetimes. And then finally, the **employment participation rate**, number of people in our society who are working and able to work. It peaked at 68% or so during the **Clinton** years and this is still low 62%. We still have people who could be participating. So all of these problems will be solved if more people were to participate and take those jobs. Why don't they take those jobs? Sometimes it's a geographic mismatch. Sometimes it is a skills mismatch and but very often it is the jobs are not paying enough. So if you want to give uh **Trump** his flowers by closing the border, you've reduced the number of people taking the jobs uh off the books and then you have the businesses are going to have to raise their **minimum wage**. They're going to have to raise their offering wage, which then might get this 7% or so that are sitting on the sidelines to take their jobs. Crazy prediction. I wouldn't be surprised if we see **Trump**, who is obviously a populist, and I tweeted about this the other day, got almost a half million views or 400,000 views. What if um **Trump** decides he's going to raise the **minimum wage**? Not saying I endorse this or not, but it's incredibly low at seven bucks an hour. Obviously, in different cities and states, it's 15 to 20. But what if **Trump** said we're going to add a dollar to it or $2 to it over each year of the next three? this would be incredibly popular and it would get some of those people off the sidelines and maybe take these jobs. So, just a crazy prediction there, but I think it's a possibility and I think they're going to lose the midterms as it stands right now. It looks like I think that's the consensus opinion and they haven't been able to do something with this affordability. Well, I think most Americans would say if you raise the **minimum wage** uh that that would increase affordability. You can make the counter argument it's going to just be **inflationary**, but I think most Americans are going to believe in that. So, I wouldn't be surprised if you saw **Trump** take action there because he does take **populist actions** like this from time to time.

**David Friedberg**: 你实际上知道关于提高**最低工资**的经济学文献吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Friedberg**: You actually the economic literature on what raising the **minimum wage** does.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 是的。它会增加**通货膨胀**，它会降低企业的盈利能力。是的。还会把东西转移到海外。不，它所做的是，它使得雇佣那些劳动价值低于**最低工资**的人成为非法行为，因此它被证明会在经济的这些领域造成更高的**失业率**。这就像经济学家们的核心发现之一。所以是的，确实有些人会因为获得更高的**最低工资**而受益，但随后会有其他人失去工作，这会促使雇主将更多的劳动力转向**自动化**。所以如果你已经担心那些人会因为**自动化**而失去工作，那这是一个缺点。所以无论如何，如果**最低工资**是万能药，它只是提高了所有人的生活水平而没有缺点，那你为什么不把**最低工资**定为每小时100美元呢？你知道，为什么每个人都会无限地提高它？显然，它不起作用，因为如果你把**最低工资**提高得太多，也就是说超过了某个人的劳动价值，那么他们就会失业。看看不同城市或**澳大利亚**或其他国家发生的事情，他们有更高的**最低工资**，他们有更高的幸福感。企业和物价上涨大约10%到20%。所以在**澳大利亚**，如果你去餐馆，或者如果你去**斯堪的纳维亚国家**，东西可能贵10%到20%，但你有一个更幸福的人口。嗯，是的，它可能导致更多的**自动化**。我们解雇了收银员，因为在**纽约**支付15到20美元给收银员变得太贵了。当然。但我们有非常低的**最低工资**。我们现在有非常低的**失业率**。而且企业显然有能力支付额外的1美元或2美元每小时。所以有理论上的学术论点，你是正确的，我完全理解。然后有实际情况，那就是**西雅图**、**旧金山**、**纽约**、**洛杉矶**、**澳大利亚**等其他地方有更高的**最低工资**。他们的人口幸福感更高。我实际上不认为它会有任何影响，因为我认为它被人工压低了，但这只是我个人的看法。我认为它会改变美国的游戏规则，我认为它实际上会解决你弗里德伯格对**社会主义**的担忧。我认为如果人们觉得有一个，你知道，对这种低成本劳动的制止，它实际上可能会让人们非常兴奋，你知道，他们可以获得一份更高薪的按小时计酬的工作，它可能会消除一些这种紧张感，就像**全民医疗保健（universal healthcare）**可能做的那样。但再次，这只是我个人的看法。

**Jason Calakanis**: Yes. It can increase **inflation** and it can lower the it can raise **inflation** and it can lower the profitability of businesses. Yeah. And move stuff offshore. No, what it does is it makes it illegal to hire someone whose labor is worth less than the **minimum wage** and so it is shown to create higher **unemployment** in those segments of the economy. It's like one of those core findings of economists. So yeah, it's true that some people will be a beneficiary of getting a higher **minimum wage**, but then there'll be other people who just lose their jobs and it creates an incentive for those employers to shift more labor towards **automation**. So if you're already worried about those people losing their jobs to **automation**, that's a downside. So anyway, if the **minimum wage** were a panacea and it just increased everyone's living standards without having downsides, why wouldn't you make the **minimum wage** $100 an hour? You know, why would you know, everyone would just keep raising it infinitely? Obviously, it doesn't work because if you raise the **minimum wage** too much, which is to say more than the value of someone's labor, then they just get unemployed. looking at what happened in the different cities or in **Australia** or other countries, they have a much higher **minimum wage** and they have much more happiness. Businesses and prices go up about 20% 10 to 20%. So in **Australia**, if you go to a restaurant or if you go to a **Scandinavian country**, things might cost 10% 20% more, but you have a happier population. Uh and yes, it could lead to more, you know, **automation**. We got rid of cashiers because it became too expensive in **New York** to pay 15 to 20 bucks for a cashier. Sure. But we have really low minimum. We have very low **unemployment** now. And the businesses can clearly afford to pay an extra buck an hour or two bucks an hour. So there's the theoretical academic argument which you are correct on and I understand it fully well. And then there's the reality on the field which is **Seattle**, **San Francisco**, **New York**, **Los Angeles**, **Australia**, other places have a much higher **minimum wage**. they have higher happiness in the population. I don't actually think it will have any impact because I think it's artificially low, but that's just one man's opinion. I think it would change the game here in America and I think it would actually do something to your uh concern Freeberg about **socialism**. I think that if people felt that there was a, you know, kind of a backs stop against this low low cost of labor, it might actually make people pretty stoked, you know, that they could get a higher paying hourly job and it might take some of that edge off in the same way **universal healthcare** might do that. But again, just one man's opinion.

**David Sachs**: 我必须说，关于所有这些经济数据，我认为我们有点抓不住重点，那就是我们正处于一场**经济繁荣（economic boom）**的开端。再次，我们看到去年第三季度和第四季度的**GDP增长率**。第三季度超过4%，第四季度超过5%。我们刚刚发布了一月份的**就业报告（January job report）**，经济新增了17.2万个**私营部门就业岗位（private sector jobs）**。这远远超出了预期，预期大约是7万个。与此同时，政府削减了4.2万个**政府就业岗位（government jobs）**。这使得**失业率**降至4.3%。所以，我记得几个月前，JCL，你还在为**失业率**上升而担忧。现在它又降下来了，你看到**建筑业（construction）**，特别是非住宅**建筑业**，创造了大量就业机会。这与**数据中心（data centers）**、正在进行的**AI繁荣（AI boom）**有关。一月份新增了3.3万个**建筑业就业岗位**。我们看到在**特朗普总统**的第二个任期内，新增了61.5万个**私营部门就业岗位**。与此同时，正如我们所讨论的，超过30万个**政府就业岗位**被削减，这提高了经济的生产力，并且实现了**Besson部长**所说的经济私有化。所以我只是认为整体经济新闻非常好。再次，我们正在经历这场**AI繁荣**。有一张新图表显示，今年预计仅来自四大**超大规模厂商（hyperscalers）**的**资本支出**就达6000亿美元。这本身就为**GDP增长**带来了大约2%的顺风。这仅仅是**资本支出**。这还不包括你可能从该基础设施在软件、应用程序和生产力方面获得的**投资回报率（ROI）**。所以，我们正在经历一场繁荣，我觉得每个人都对此感到悲观。嗯，你知道，他们专注于这份

<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sachs**: I got to say on all this economic data, I I think we're kind of missing the lead here, which is we are at the beginning of an **economic boom**. Again, we saw it in the **GDP growth rates** in Q3 and Q4 last year. Over 4% Q3, over 5% Q4. We just had a **January job report** where the economy added 172,000 new **private sector jobs**. This blew away the expectation which was around 70,000. At the same time, the government shed 42,000 **government jobs**. The net of this was to bring the **unemployment rate** down to 4.3%. So, I remember a few months ago, JCL, you were ringing your hands about the fact that the **unemployment rate** had ticked up. Well, now it's back down and you're seeing a lot of jobs being created in **construction**, especially non-residential **construction**. Has to do with the **data centers**, the **AI boom** that's going on. 33,000 new **construction jobs** in January. We've seen in **President Trump's** second term, you've had 615,000 new **private sector jobs** been created. While again like we talked about over 300,000 **government jobs** have been cut which increases the productivity of the economy and it does what **Secretary Besson** says which is rep privatize the economy. So I just think that the overall economic news is really good. Again we have this **AI boom** going on. There's a new chart showing that the **capex** for this year that's expected just from the four leading **hyperscalers** is $600 billion just from four companies. That's a roughly 2% tailwind to **GDP growth** right there. That is just the **capex**. That doesn't include all the **ROI** that you might get from that infrastructure on the software side, on the application side, the productivity side. So, we have a boom going on and I feel like everyone's kind of blackpilling about this. Uh, you know, they're focusing on this

**David Sachs**: 所有的就业创造也都被本土出生的美国人享受了。所有的失业都发生在了非本土出生的美国人身上，这相当引人注目。所以，我认为这也将有利于更多的美国人。顺便说一句，关于失业问题，十月份略有上升，因为十月份的裁员。还记得国防部（Doge）创建了裁员计划吗？

**David Sachs**: all The job creation has been enjoyed by native born Americans as well. All the job loss has been on non-nativeborn Americans which is pretty remarkable.

**Jason Calakanis**: 更准确地说，在美国，非法移民工作的两大领域，大多数人不知道，第一是**建筑业**，第二是**休闲和酒店业（leisure and hospitality）**。所以这两个类别有250万人工作。这就是为什么我说，如果你想看到更多的美国人就业，你想看到工资上涨。如果你去那些企业，发现它们雇佣非法移民，这是世界上最容易做的事情，你只要出现在一个**建筑工地**，拍下所有非法工作的人的照片，这就是**ICE（移民及海关执法局）**以前的做法。他们会监视**建筑工地**，然后他们会找到建筑公司的人，然后他们必须雇佣美国人，否则那家建筑公司就会遇到大麻烦。过去20年里，专门针对**建筑工地**的罚款已经达到了数百万美元，这将促使更多的人提高**建筑工人**的工资，这将进一步降低**失业率**并提高**劳动力参与率**。这就是巨大的胜利所在。去**建筑工地**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: And to just put a finer point on it, the top two areas where illegal aliens are working in the United States, most people don't know this, **construction**, number one, and the second one is **leisure and hospitality**. So you got two and a half million people working in those two categories. Which is why I said if you want to see more Americans take jobs and you want to see wages go up. If you went to those businesses and you find those businesses for hiring illegal aliens, which is the easiest thing in the world to do, you just show up at a **construction site**, you take pictures of everybody who is working illegally, which is what they used to do in the **ICE agency**. They would then do um you know **surveillance of construction sites** and then they would go and find the construction person and then they had to hire Americans or that construction company would get in serious trouble. There's been multi-million dollar fines done over the last 20 years specifically on **construction sites** and that would drive more people to raise the wages of **construction workers** which would even lower **unemployment** more and increase **labor participation**. That's where the big win is. Go to **construction sites**.

The if there was not a job available in **construction** for 20, 30, 40 bucks an hour off the books and not paying taxes, those immigrants who are crossing illegally would not be here.

**Jason Calakanis**: 我实际上有统计数据。我可以给你一个统计数据。根据**《洛杉矶时报》（LA Times）**的这项调查，75%的移民来这里是为了更好的工作机会。非法来到美国的**移民**是为了经济原因。他们不是来这里犯罪的。他们不是来这里获得福利的。那在名单上排得很靠后。那只是一小部分。

<details>

**Jason Calakanis**: Actually have statistics. I can give you a statistic on. According to this **LA Times** survey, 75% of immigrants come here for better job opportunities. People coming to America illegally are coming here for economic reasons. They are not coming here to commit crimes. They are not coming here to get benefits. That is way down the list. That is a small percentage.

**David Friedberg**: 这将如何驱逐所有那些黑帮分子、强奸犯、杀人犯，那些不在农场工作的人？他们不这样做。

**David Friedberg**: How is this going to deport all the gang bangers, the rapists, the murderers, the ones who aren't working on a farm? They're not doing

**Jason Calakanis**: 那是完全不同的问题。他们应该去做那个。那是不同的问题。他们应该去做那些，去追查。

**Jason Calakanis**: That's a totally separate issue. They should go do that. That's a separate issue. They should go do those and go after

**David Friedberg**: 那就是**ICE**正在做的事情。他们试图围捕已知的罪犯，他们获得了逮捕令，然后逮捕并驱逐他们。那是另一个问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Friedberg**: that is what **ICE** was doing. They're trying to round up the known criminals for whom they get warrants and then they capture them and deport them. That's a separate problem.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 是的，那是两个不同的问题。我不是在谈论黑帮分子的问题。你可以处理黑帮分子。我是在谈论如果你真的想处理大量的人。黑帮分子是少数。在**建筑业**工作、在酒店工作的人是多数。是的，两者都同样重要。萨克斯，我们意见一致。好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Yeah, those are two separate problems. I'm not talking about the problem of gang bangers. You can do gang bangers. I'm talking about if you actually want to move big numbers. The gang bangers are small number. The people working in **construction** working at hotels are a big number. Yeah, they're both equally important. Saxs, we're in agreement. Okay.

</details>

**David Sachs**: 是的。我们没有大规模做的事情是追查那些为大多数来这里的人创造激励的企业。

### 法拉利电动车与汽车文化变迁

**Jason Calakanis**: **法拉利（Ferrari）**将推出一款新车。这将是他们的第一款**全电动汽车（all electric vehicle）**。非常两极分化。这是**《汽车与驾驶员》（Car and Driver）**杂志对这款车的插图。这不是准确的版本，因为它将在五月发布，但这是他们认为它会是什么样子。1000多马力，四个**电动马达**，0到60英里/小时加速不到2.5秒。续航里程330英里。这是有史以来最重的**法拉利**，5100磅，而标志性的**F40**只有3000磅。它将于2026年5月推出。但我们看到了内饰，这就是每个人都在议论纷纷的地方。它在互联网上走红了。前**苹果（Apple）**设计总监**Johnny Ive**和他的搭档**Marc Newson**（他也设计了标志性的**福特（Ford）021C概念车**）的团队参与了这款车的设计。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: **Ferrari** has a new car coming out. It's going to be their first **all electric vehicle**. Very polarizing. Here's an illustration of the vehicle from **Car and Driver**. This is not the accurate one because it's going to be revealed in May, but this is what they think it's going to look like. 1,000 plus horsepower, four **electric motors**, 0 to 60 in under 2.5 seconds. Uh 330 mi range. It's the heaviest **Ferrari** ever, 5100 lb compared to the iconic **F40**, which was but 3,000 lb. It's going to launch in May of 2026. But we got to see the interior, and this is what everybody's buzzing about. It's gone viral on the interwebs. former **Apple** design chief **Johnny IV** uh on his team with his partner **Mark Nuome** who also designed the iconic **Ford 021C concept car** were involved in this.

</details>

**David Friedberg**: 等等，那是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Friedberg**: Wait, what is that?

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 嗯，这就像如果你是个车迷，这就像是**福特**做的一个令人难以置信的创新设计时刻，但从未实现。它看起来非常像**苹果**产品。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Uh it's this is like if you're a car nerd, this was like this incredibly innovative moment in design that never happened that **Ford** did it. It looks very similar to an **Apple** product.

</details>

**David Friedberg**: 这是新车的钥匙。它看起来像动画电影《汽车总动员》里的角色，你知道。你有一把漂亮的方形玻璃钥匙，就像**iPhone**一样。你把它插进去，黄色的**法拉利**黄就会流出并进入换挡杆。这是一个人们认为非常漂亮的细节。屏幕看起来非常**Mac风格**，但与**特斯拉（Tesla）**不同的是，**特斯拉**没有按钮并移除了按钮。他们在这里增加了按钮，并使按钮非常触感。所有跑车爱好者都喜欢触感记忆式按钮，你可以随意玩弄和翻转，感觉自己像个战斗机飞行员。最后，启动汽车就像启动一架喷气式飞机。你有一个启动按钮，你扭动并按下，它会使整辆车变成**法拉利**橙色或红色。嗯，是的，那就是内饰，萨克斯。你买不买？你喜欢吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Friedberg**: Here's the key for the new looks like an animated character in cars or something like that, you know. You have this beautiful square glass key like an **iPhone**. You put it in and the yellow **Ferrari** yellow drains out and goes into the shifter. That was one nuance that people thought was very beautiful. The screen looks very **Mac inspired** except unlike **Tesla** which is uh no buttons and removing buttons. They're adding buttons here and making the buttons very tactile. All the sports car enthusiasts love tactile memory based buttons that you can just have fun with and flip and feel like you're a fighter pilot. Finally, the uh turning the car on is like starting up a jet. You have a launch button you twist and press and it makes the whole car turn **Ferrari** orange or red. And uh yeah, that's the inside sachs. You buying one or not? You like it?

</details>

**David Sachs**: 我看到每个人都在议论这个设计，我觉得有点不公平，因为我实际上总体上喜欢内饰。我认为它在**特斯拉**的全玻璃驾驶舱和完全模拟的老式**法拉利**内饰之间找到了一个折衷方案。就像你说的，它结合了屏幕和按钮。他们特意展示了这些按钮不仅触感很好，而且发出了悦耳的声音等等。它看起来非常坚固。所以，我认为内饰实际上相当不错。再次，在赛车内饰的简洁性、**iPad**屏幕的简洁性以及拥有足够多的按钮之间取得了很好的平衡，你可以围绕这些按钮形成肌肉记忆，知道所有控制在哪里。你不需要在菜单中寻找它们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sachs**: I saw I saw everyone just, you know, all over this design and I thought it was a little bit unfair in the sense that I actually overall like the interior. I thought it found a compromise between, you know, let's call it the all glass cockpit of a **Tesla** versus a totally analog old **Ferrari** interior. Like you said, it it had a combination of screens, but then also buttons. And they made a point of showing that the buttons were not only nicely tactile, but they also made pleasing sounds and that kind of stuff. It seemed very heavy duty. So, I thought the interior actually was pretty good. Again, nice balance between kind of the interior of a race car, the simplicity of that **iPad** screen, but also having enough sort of buttons that you develop muscle memory around where all the controls are. You don't have to go hunting for them through a menu.

</details>

**David Friedberg**: 我认为问题不在内饰上。我认为问题在外饰上。我讨厌这辆车的外观。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Friedberg**: I thought the missier wasn't on the inside. I thought it was on the outside. I hate the look of the outside of this car.

</details>

**David Sachs**: 在我看来，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sachs**: It looks to me,

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 顺便说一句，需要明确的是，那个外观是人们正在预测的。它不是最终版本。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: by the way, just to be clear, that look is what people are projecting. It's not the final version.

</details>

**David Friedberg**: 我认为这太糟糕了。在我看来，这看起来像一辆**科尔维特（Corvette）**，甚至像一辆**弗兰阿扎姆（Franazam）**。我的意思是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Friedberg**: I think this is terrible. This to me looks like a **Corvette** maybe or even like a **Franazam**. I mean

</details>

**David Sachs**: 它看起来像一辆**Model 3**。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sachs**: it looks like a **Model 3**. Yeah.

</details>

**David Friedberg**: 我不喜欢那个，那个黑色的部分在前面，甚至那个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Friedberg**: I don't like the What's that like the black part of the front or even the

</details>

**David Sachs**: 格栅？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sachs**: grill?

</details>

**David Friedberg**: 格栅。它看起来很糟糕，而且侧面那些东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Friedberg**: The grill. It looks terrible and the things going on on the sides

</details>

**David Sachs**: 然后车尾几乎看起来像一辆**掀背车（hatchback）**或什么的。它只是，你知道，一辆**法拉利**应该看起来更流畅。它应该看起来更圆润，并且部件应该更少。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sachs**: and then the back almost looks like a **hatchback** or something. It's just, you know, uh a **Ferrari** should look swoopier. It should look curvier and there should be fewer different pieces to it.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 100%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: 100%.

</details>

**David Sachs**: 所以，我不知道。在我看来，它不像一辆**法拉利**，但我认为内饰实际上还不错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David Sachs**: So, I don't know. Doesn't look right to me as a **Ferrari**, but I thought the inside actually was was fine.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 我喜欢它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: I like it.

</details>

**David Sachs**: 是的。

**David Sachs**: **全自动驾驶（Full Self-Driving, FSD）**让我再次成为一名司机，因为我只是设置了**全自动驾驶**。

**David Sachs**: 嗯，有了**FSD**。

**Jason Calakanis**: you you like uh you've always liked to drive Jamoth. I think you you drive yourself these days or you uh

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: 我开着一辆带有**FSD**的**Model Y**，或者我坐**Waymo**。两者之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: I drive myself in a **Model Y** with **FSD** or I take a **Whimo**. One of the two.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 是的，**Waymo**现在在山谷里。是的。在小便。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Yeah, **Whimo's** in the valley now. Yeah. On the piss.

</details>

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: 我开过**法拉利**。我想告诉你的是，有些东西非常独特。**法拉利**的体验与其他所有汽车都不同。我认为新任CEO**Benedetto Vigna**是一位非常有才华的**高管**，我认为他可能会带来一些美好的东西。问题是我们正在与时间赛跑。我以前说过，但**FSD**和**自动驾驶（autonomy）**将改变甚至知道驾驶意味着什么的人数。当人们看到有人真正拥抱纯种马赛车时，它会感觉只会在越来越小的地方，越来越不频繁地发生。这并不是因为这些汽车不漂亮，而是因为在大多数情况下，风险对大多数人来说没有任何意义。我认为这将是最大的变化。就像美国的**汽车文化（car culture）**是美国文化中深刻的一部分。你知道，度假时从A地开到B地，自由的感觉，**州际公路系统（interstate highway system）**的建设。这些都是使美国伟大的重要组成部分，也是所有这些生产力赖以存在的轨道。现在我认为这一切都将改变。所以我不知道。我的意思是，我认为这辆车可能会很漂亮。就像**法拉利**很漂亮一样。在**雷德伍德城（Redwood City）**有一家**法拉利经销商**。每当我开车经过时，我都会放慢速度，向外看。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: I've had a **Ferrari**. What I would tell you is that there's just something that's very unique. There's a **Ferrari** experience that's different from every other car. And I think that the new CEO, **Benedtovenia**, is a very talented executive and I think that he's probably going to land something beautiful. The thing is that we are racing against time. And I've said this before, but **FSD** and **autonomy** is going to shift the number of people that even know what it means to drive. It will feel like when we look at somebody who really embraces thoroughbed racing, it's just going to happen in smaller and smaller places and less and less often. And that's not because these cars aren't beautiful, but it's because the risk will not make any sense for most people under most conditions. And I think that's the big thing that's going to change. Like the **car culture** in America was a profound part of the American culture. You know, driving from A to B on vacation, the sense of freedom, the building of the **interstate highway system**. These were huge parts of what made America great and the rails on which all this productivity sat on top of. And now I think it's all going to change. So I don't know. I mean, I think the car will probably be beautiful. Like **Ferraris** are beautiful. There's a **Ferrari** dealership in **Redwood City**. And whenever I drive by it, I slow down and I look out.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 嗯，嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Yum, yum.

</details>

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: 他们制造漂亮的汽车。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: They make beautiful cars.

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 艺术品。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason Calakanis**: Piece of art. Yeah.

</details>

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: 我认为在**中国**和**印度**这样的地方，它们总是会有市场。但我认为在美国这样的地方，如果你自己开车，支付保险会变得非常昂贵。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: And I think in places like **China** and **India**, they're always going to have a market. But I think in places like the United States, it's going to become so expensive to pay for the insurance if you are driving yourself

</details>

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: 购买任何汽车的想法会变得越来越困难，仅仅因为我认为数学会很困难。但**法拉利**内部的体验是首屈一指的。所以很可能，会有很多像**法拉利**这样的高端汽车，你为体验付费，你有能力支付汽车费用，你会支付保险，奢侈品，所有这些，然后我们其他人将使用**FSD**或**Waymo**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath Palihapitiya**: that the idea that you would buy any car is going to feel tougher and tougher just because I think the math is going to be tough. But the experience inside of the **Ferrari** is second to none. So it probably is that there's going to be a bunch of high-end cars like **Ferrari** where you pay for the experience, you're in a position to pay for the car, you'll pay for the insurance, the luxury, all of it, and then the rest of us will be using **FSD** or **Whimo**

</details>

**Jason Calakanis**: 100%。

**Jason Calakanis**: 100%.

**Jason Calakanis**: 我们有两辆**Model Y**，我们必须再买一辆车，就像，嗯，我们还能买什么？我们别无选择。要么买最后一批**Model X**之一。

**Jason Calakanis**: I we have two **Model Y's** and we have to get another car and it's like, well, what else can we buy? We have no choice. It's either buy one of the last **X's**.

**David Sachs**: 我对**Model X**的贬值感到非常生气，我现在有一个真正的问题，我有五个孩子，所以**Model X**是唯一能容纳七个人的车，所以我需要一辆新的。
