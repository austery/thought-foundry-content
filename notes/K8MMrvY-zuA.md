大家好，我是克里斯汀。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hey there, it's Christine.</p>
</details>

这个季度，我们将推出一系列关于送礼的节目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This season, we're dropping a series of giftgiving episodes.</p>
</details>

你应该看看我们上一期节目，里面全是我们的专家员工提供的送礼建议。

</details>

今天，我们将聚焦于送礼世界中一个可能最具挑战性的场景，那就是为那些“难搞”的人挑选礼物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Today we're focusing on potentially one of the most challenging scenarios in the giftgiving world and that is people who are hard to shop for.</p>
</details>

我们生活中可能都有这样的人，也许他们非常挑剔，或者品味极佳，又或者他们似乎从不满意你送给他们的礼物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We all probably have someone like this in our lives. Maybe it's somebody who's really picky or they have really excellent taste or maybe they just never seem to be quite happy with what you've given them.</p>
</details>

所以，我们今天将接受这个挑战，努力为那些难以取悦的人想出好主意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, we're going to take on this challenge today and try to come up with great ideas for people who are hard to please.</p>

<p class="english-text">It's so great to have you.</p>
</details>

好的，如果有人正在考虑为某个特定的人购买礼物，他们知道这个人很难取悦，他们将开始购物之旅。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, so if somebody is thinking about a particular person that they want to buy a gift for, they know that they're hard to please. They're going to start the shopping journey.</p>
</details>

你建议人们问自己哪些问题，或者人们可以使用哪些参数呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What are the sort of questions that you recommend people ask themselves or you know maybe some parameters that people can use?</p>
</details>

### 如何为“难搞”的人挑选礼物

Hannah: 我真的会努力回想我最近与那个人的关系，思考我们最近的对话、短信交流或他们发给我的链接，以及我们在最近的通信中让他们感到充满活力的事物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I really try to think back on my relationship with the person as of late and think about like conversations we've had or texts we've exchanged or links they've sent me and things that have sort of like energized them in the most recent correspondence that we've had together.</p>
</details>

我的朋友李总是给我发关于珠宝的东西，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My friend Lee is always texting me stuff about jewelry, right?</p>
</details>

她总是问：“你喜欢这个吗？你喜欢这个吗？这个怎么样？那个怎么样？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">She's always like, "Do you like this? Do you like this? How about this? What about that?</p>
</details>

Christine: 她是在给你暗示吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is she Is she dropping your hints?"</p>
</details>

Hannah: 所以，我就是觉得，那对她来说是一种兴趣，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So like I'm like but she just that's like an interest for her right she has a lot of energy around that you know my partner the only thing I can get him to like really engage with me on conversation these days is about his garden like that is you will see no one more enlivened than Jim when his garden is at hand people give you hints people tell you you know what is it that they're interested and then that sort of helps me to like narrow in on okay Jim's feeling this garden moment how can I support that how can I acknowledge that how can I like show that I've been like listening to you over the past year or whatever And you'd be surprised even people that you're not in touch with so much. I think people do tell you what they're interested in and tell you where their hearts sort of lie at the moment.</p>
</details>

她在这方面有很多精力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">she has a lot of energy around that you know my partner the only thing I can get him to like really engage with me on conversation these days is about his garden like that is you will see no one more enlivened than Jim when his garden is at hand people give you hints people tell you you know what is it that they're interested and then that sort of helps me to like narrow in on okay Jim's feeling this garden moment how can I support that how can I acknowledge that how can I like show that I've been like listening to you over the past year or whatever And you'd be surprised even people that you're not in touch with so much. I think people do tell you what they're interested in and tell you where their hearts sort of lie at the moment.</p>
</details>

你知道，我的伴侣，这些天我唯一能让他真正和我聊起来的话题就是他的花园。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">my partner the only thing I can get him to like really engage with me on conversation these days is about his garden like that is you will see no one more enlivened than Jim when his garden is at hand people give you hints people tell you you know what is it that they're interested and then that sort of helps me to like narrow in on okay Jim's feeling this garden moment how can I support that how can I acknowledge that how can I like show that I've been like listening to you over the past year or whatever And you'd be surprised even people that you're not in touch with so much. I think people do tell you what they're interested in and tell you where their hearts sort of lie at the moment.</p>
</details>

当吉姆谈论他的花园时，你不会看到比他更充满活力的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you will see no one more enlivened than Jim when his garden is at hand people give you hints people tell you you know what is it that they're interested and then that sort of helps me to like narrow in on okay Jim's feeling this garden moment how can I support that how can I acknowledge that how can I like show that I've been like listening to you over the past year or whatever And you'd be surprised even people that you're not in touch with so much. I think people do tell you what they're interested in and tell you where their hearts sort of lie at the moment.</p>
</details>

人们会给你暗示，人们会告诉你他们对什么感兴趣，然后这有助于我缩小范围，比如，好的，吉姆现在正沉浸在花园的氛围中，我如何支持他？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">people give you hints people tell you you know what is it that they're interested and then that sort of helps me to like narrow in on okay Jim's feeling this garden moment how can I support that how can I acknowledge that how can I like show that I've been like listening to you over the past year or whatever And you'd be surprised even people that you're not in touch with so much. I think people do tell you what they're interested in and tell you where their hearts sort of lie at the moment.</p>
</details>

我如何认可这一点？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how can I acknowledge that how can I like show that I've been like listening to you over the past year or whatever And you'd be surprised even people that you're not in touch with so much. I think people do tell you what they're interested in and tell you where their hearts sort of lie at the moment.</p>
</details>

我如何表明我过去一年一直在倾听你的话？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how can I like show that I've been like listening to you over the past year or whatever And you'd be surprised even people that you're not in touch with so much. I think people do tell you what they're interested in and tell you where their hearts sort of lie at the moment.</p>
</details>

你会惊讶地发现，即使是你不太常联系的人，我认为人们也会告诉你他们对什么感兴趣，告诉你他们当下心之所向。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you'd be surprised even people that you're not in touch with so much. I think people do tell you what they're interested in and tell you where their hearts sort of lie at the moment.</p>
</details>

Christine: 这真是太体贴了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's so thoughtful.</p>
</details>

我认为这对于任何送礼来说都是一个很好的普遍建议，对吧，要体贴周到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that's just a good general tip, right, for any gift giving to be thoughtful.</p>
</details>

好的，现在我们进入这一集真正有趣的部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so this is where we get into the really fun part of this episode.</p>
</details>

我们有一些听众的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have some listener questions.</p>
</details>

哦，我喜欢这些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, I love these.</p>
</details>

我知道你也是，我也知道你会有一些很棒的建议给这些人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I know you do and I know you're going to have some great suggestions for these folks.</p>
</details>

那么，让我们听听苏的第一个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, let's listen to this first question from Sue.</p>
</details>

Sue: 大家好，**Wirecutter**。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hi, wire cutter.</p>
</details>

我希望得到一些送给我女儿的礼物建议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would love to have some gift suggestions for my daughter.</p>
</details>

我女儿是一名奥运水手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My daughter is an Olympic sailor.</p>
</details>

她在东京和巴黎都参加过帆船比赛，并希望能获得洛杉矶奥运会的参赛资格。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">She sailed at Tokyo and Paris and is hoping to qualify for Los Angeles.</p>
</details>

她不喜欢很多东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">She doesn't like a lot of things.</p>
</details>

她不喜欢很多物品，因为她住的公寓很小，而且她经常旅行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">She doesn't like a lot of stuff because she has a small apartment and she's traveling a lot.</p>
</details>

她在很多国家旅行和航海。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">She travels and sails in a lot of foreign countries.</p>
</details>

所以，她已经接触过所有这些东西了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, she's got access to all that.</p>
</details>

我当然也买不起一艘新船给她。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I certainly can't afford to buy her a new boat.</p>
</details>

所以，我希望能得到一些建议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I'd love some suggestions.</p>
</details>

非常感谢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you very much.</p>
</details>

Christine: 苏，你女儿真是太迷人了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sue, your daughter is fascinating.</p>
</details>

我有点想过她的生活，我希望我的女儿在18年后也能环游世界。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I kind of want to live her life and I hope my daughter is sailing the world in 18 years.</p>
</details>

好的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay.</p>
</details>

苏的女儿是一名运动员，经常旅行，非常热爱帆船运动，而且没有太多空间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Sue's daughter is an athlete, travels a ton, very into sailing, does not have much space.</p>
</details>

你有什么想法吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What are some things that come to mind?</p>
</details>

### 为奥运水手女儿挑选礼物

Hannah: 我首先想到的是，我曾为我们家的度假小屋做过这件事，那就是定制一幅她船只的小肖像。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first thing that came to mind for me was I've done this with this family cottage we have is commission a little portrait of her boat.</p>
</details>

我当时在想，也许是她赢得一场重要比赛的特别船只，或者只是她的第一艘船。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, I was thinking about maybe a really special boat to her that she won a big race on or just maybe her first boat.</p>
</details>

我相信你手头有一些照片。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm sure you have some photographs kicking around.</p>
</details>

有一个叫做**My Da Vinci**（My Da Vinci: 一项提供定制艺术肖像服务的在线平台）的服务，它的网站看起来像是1996年之后就没有更新过，但服务却令人难以置信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there's this service called My Da Vinci and the website looks like it hasn't been updated since 1996, but the service is incredible.</p>
</details>

他们雇佣了一批艺术家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They like sort of employ this stable of artists.</p>
</details>

你可以选择水彩或炭笔画，无论你喜欢哪种风格。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can choose watercolor or charcoal, whatever your vibe is.</p>
</details>

而且，我的画在36小时内就收到了校样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And within I mean, I feel like I got mine in 36 hours. you'll get a proof of this portrait of your I did like I said I did a cabin but you could do her boat and you could give feedback like oh you know um there was sort of like bushes that were over rot or whatever and I sort of gave that feedback they adjusted a little bit and then 2 weeks later or a week later I got this like beautiful watercolor portrait of a family cabin that's like so treasured now.</p>
</details>

你会收到这幅肖像的校样，我做的是小屋，但你可以画她的船，你可以提供反馈，比如，哦，你知道，有一些灌木丛长得太茂盛了等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you'll get a proof of this portrait of your I did like I said I did a cabin but you could do her boat and you could give feedback like oh you know um there was sort of like bushes that were over rot or whatever and I sort of gave that feedback they adjusted a little bit and then 2 weeks later or a week later I got this like beautiful watercolor portrait of a family cabin that's like so treasured now.</p>
</details>

我提供了反馈，他们做了一些调整，然后两周后或一周后，我收到了一幅如此珍贵的家庭小屋的水彩肖像。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you'll get a proof of this portrait of your I did like I said I did a cabin but you could do her boat and you could give feedback like oh you know um there was sort of like bushes that were over rot or whatever and I sort of gave that feedback they adjusted a little bit and then 2 weeks later or a week later I got this like beautiful watercolor portrait of a family cabin that's like so treasured now.</p>
</details>

所以我觉得这会很适合你女儿，而且它不占太多空间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I feel like that would be great for your daughter and it doesn't take up a ton of space.</p>
</details>

你可以把它装裱起来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You could frame it.</p>
</details>

酷的是你还会得到一个数字校样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The cool thing is you also get a digital proof of it.</p>
</details>

所以你可以用它来制作一套明信片，或者在你送给她原画后，在其他地方使用这张图片。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So like you could use that on like you could make her a set of postcards or you could use that image elsewhere in your life after you give her the original.</p>
</details>

这是一个主意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's one idea.</p>
</details>

Christine: 太棒了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Great.</p>
</details>

我喜欢这个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I love that.</p>
</details>

好的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay.</p>
</details>

还有其他建议给苏吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Any other ideas for Sue?</p>
</details>

Hannah: 我想到的还有她经常旅行，几乎是住在行李箱里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I guess it also comes to mind like her traveling so much and being just sort of almost living out of a suitcase.</p>
</details>

我认为你可以更新一些旅行用品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
</details>

有一种非常昂贵但很棒的产品，叫做**Cadence胶囊**（Cadence胶囊：一种用于分装洗漱用品的旅行收纳盒）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's these really expensive and amazing, they're called cadence capsules and it's for decanting your toiletries into and they're this beautiful matte texture and they tessellate together and they have this satisfying magnetism.</p>
</details>

它们是用来分装洗漱用品的，有着美丽的哑光质地，可以像拼图一样组合在一起，并且具有令人满意的磁性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">they're called cadence capsules and it's for decanting your toiletries into and they're this beautiful matte texture and they tessellate together and they have this satisfying magnetism.</p>
</details>

所以，我觉得她可能会喜欢这些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I think she might love those.</p>
</details>

**Cadence胶囊**。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Cadence capsules.</p>
</details>

我还认为，你知道，我们有一些非常好的**Kodapaxi收纳包**（Kodapaxi收纳包：一种用于旅行时整理衣物和物品的拉链袋），它们颜色鲜艳，价格也相当实惠。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I also think, you know, we have some really good Kodapaxi packing cubes that come in these really bright colors and are pretty affordable.</p>
</details>

我很乐意收到它们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would love to receive them.</p>
</details>

我有收纳包，但我的很糟糕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have packing cubes. Mine stink.</p>
</details>

也许她也有收纳包，而且她的也很糟糕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Maybe she has packing cubes and hers stink too.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为这些会很棒，可以支持她所过的旅行生活方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I think those could be awesome. thinking around supporting that travel lifestyle that she lives.</p>
</details>

Christine: 我也喜欢那些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I love those, too.</p>
</details>

对于任何喜欢旅行的人来说，这些都是很棒的礼物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For anyone who likes to travel, those are great gifts.</p>
</details>

对于不熟悉收纳包的人来说，它们基本上就是一些带拉链的小袋子，你可以把衣服、洗漱用品以及所有旅行用品放进去，让所有东西在手提箱或行李袋中保持井井有条。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And for people who aren't familiar with packing cubes, they're basically like these little zippered pouches that you can put your clothes and your toiletries and all the various things that you travel with and keep all that stuff organized in a suitcase or a duffel bag or whatever.</p>
</details>

Hannah: 而且它们还能稍微压缩一下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it compresses them a little bit.</p>
</details>

所以，我喜欢不托运行李旅行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, like I like to travel with no checked luggage.</p>
</details>

它只是以一种可实现的方式帮助你做到这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It just helps you to make that happen in a, you know, achievable way.</p>
</details>

Christine: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

我喜欢那些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I love those.</p>
</details>

太棒了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's so great.</p>
</details>

好的。

耶。

<p class="english-text">Yay.</p>
</details>

好的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay.</p>
</details>

我们收到了听众RM的类似问题。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So, we have a similar question from a listener RM.</p>
</details>

我来大声读出这个问题。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I'm going to read this one out loud.</p>
</details>

RM: 我的姐姐在华尔街赚了大钱后退休了，她什么都不缺。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My sister retired after making Fat Bank on Wall Street and wants for nothing.</p>
</details>

因为她喜欢个人手工制作的礼物，我曾送给她我手吹的玻璃器皿、我缝制的被子、不止一本带有手写书法的相册，甚至还有一顿需要层压面团的主菜的完整晚餐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As she loves personally handcrafted gifts, I've given her glassware I've hand blown, a quilt I stitched, more than one photo album with hand calligraphy, even a full dinner with a mane requiring laminated dough.</p>
</details>

今年，我不太可能有时间制作我设想的皮质斜挎包，尽管我已经买好了必要的工具。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This year, I'm unlikely to have the time to create the leather sling bag I envisioned, despite having already bought the necessary autumal.</p>
</details>

有什么至少是“伪个性化”的礼物可以凑合吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Any ideas for a gift that's at least pseudo personal that might suffice?</p>
</details>

顺便说一句，她自己不喜欢上工艺课或手工课。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">FYI, she herself doesn't care for taking craft lessons or classes.</p>
</details>

好的，这个问题很难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, this one's tough.</p>
</details>

### 为“什么都不缺”的亲友挑选礼物

Hannah: 我知道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I know.</p>
</details>

但我喜欢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I like it though.</p>
</details>

我首先想到的是，我们有一个**Etsy**（Etsy: 一个专注于手工制品、复古商品和独特礼品的全球在线市场）卖家，如果你有某个特别的人的一小段手写字迹，你可以把它刻在银或金色的手镯上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, the first thing that came to mind was we have an Etsy seller who if you have a little piece of handwriting from someone special, you can have it engraved onto a silver or gold cuff.</p>
</details>

就是手腕上的那种，它是一个小手镯，内侧会刻上你想要的任何手写字迹。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, for your wrist for your wrist, like it's a little it's a little cufflet and the interior would have this like script of whatever handwriting you want on it.</p>
</details>

也许是他们母亲或父亲的一些有趣的话，刻在手镯内侧会非常有意义，而且它有手工制作的感觉，因为它确实是手工制作的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Maybe something funny from their mother or from their father that could be really meaningful on the interior of a bracelet and has that handmade feel because it is handmade.</p>
</details>

这个不是手工制作的，但它是个性化的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This one is not handmade, but it's personalized.</p>
</details>

回到那些不是完全垃圾的塑料制品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Back to like plastic that isn't total junk.</p>
</details>

也许你听说过**Funko Pop**（Funko Pop: 一种流行的大头Q版收藏人偶）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Maybe you have heard of these things called Funko Pop.</p>
</details>

我们总是推荐**Funko Pop**。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We are always recommending Funko Pop.</p>
</details>

**Funko Pop**是你在商场里可以买到的小饰品，但你可以在网上找到一个非常棒的界面，在那里你可以个性化定制一个**Funko Pop**。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Funko Pop are these little trinkets you can get in the mall, but you can go online and they have this really great interface where you can personalize a Funko Pop.</p>
</details>

Christine: 对于听众来说，请给我们描述一下**Funko Pop**长什么样，因为我认为不是每个人都知道它们是什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And for listeners, give us a picture of what a Funko Pop looks like because I don't think everybody knows what they are.</p>
</details>

Hannah: 我觉得它们大约3英寸高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think they're like 3 in tall.</p>
</details>

它们有小小的、矮胖的、圆圆的脸。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They have little squat round little faces.</p>
</details>

它们就像一个小娃娃。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They're like a little doll.</p>
</details>

Christine: 一个小娃娃。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A little doll.</p>
</details>

一个小雕像。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A little figurine.</p>
</details>

Hannah: 但它们真的能激发快乐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But they really spark joy.</p>
</details>

我无法解释。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I can't explain it.</p>
</details>

我来这里不是为了解释它们为什么能激发快乐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That is not what I'm here to do is explain why they spark joy.</p>
</details>

我只会告诉你它们确实如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I will just tell you that they do.</p>
</details>

它们太可爱了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They are so cute.</p>
</details>

所以，他们在**Funko Pop**网站上提供的这个模块，你可以为你的姐姐或她的家人重新制作一个小雕像。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So this module that they have on the on the Funko Pub website, you could recreate a little figurine of your sister or of her family.</p>
</details>

它们真是太迷人、太令人愉快了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And they are just so charming and so delightful.</p>
</details>

它们装在一个很棒的盒子里，外面写着她的名字。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They come in sort of a great box that says her name on the outside.</p>
</details>

我真的从未见过我认识的人的**Funko Pop**。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've really never seen one of someone that I know.</p>
</details>

我们在办公室为一些员工制作过几个，我看到它们时就非常喜欢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We've done a few of them in the office for like staffers and I I just love them when I see them.</p>
</details>

所以，我喜欢这个在线模块的另一个原因是，它的步骤不多，你不会感到被困住，觉得“我做不了这个”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the other thing I like about the online module is that it's not so many steps that you're going to get like bogged down and be like, I actually can't do this.</p>
</details>

你可以在5分钟内制作一个绝对可爱的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You could make an absolutely adorable one in 5 minutes flat.</p>
</details>

所以，嗯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, um</p>
</details>

Christine: 我喜欢这个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I love that.</p>
</details>

这超级有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's super fun.</p>
</details>

我认为这也会是一个很棒的，也许有点贵，但会是一个很棒的秘密圣诞老人礼物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that would also make a great maybe a little bit expensive, but a great secret Santa or gift.</p>
</details>

是的，它们超级有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, they're they're super fun.</p>
</details>

Christine: 我们收到了来自缅因州迈克的一个很棒的问题，他正在为一对夫妇购物，这对夫妇非常慷慨，但又什么都不想要或不需要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have got a great question from Mike in Maine who is shopping for a couple who are at once very generous but don't want or need much of anything.</p>
</details>

让我们听听。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's listen.</p>
</details>

Mike: 大家好，**Wirecutter**。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello wire cutter.</p>
</details>

我有一对很棒的朋友，一对非常棒的夫妇，我们关系非常非常亲密。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have these wonderful friends, a terrific couple, and we are very, very close.</p>
</details>

然而，给他们买礼物是我做过的最困难的事情之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Buying them gifts, however, is one of the most difficult things I've ever had to do.</p>
</details>

他们非常富有，完全不装腔作势，见到他们时，你根本不会知道他们的财富，除了他们穿着得体、打理得很好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They are incredibly well off, totally unpretentious, and when meeting them, you'd have no idea of their wealth other than they are well-dressed and well-groomed.</p>
</details>

他们对我非常非常慷慨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They are very, very generous to me.</p>
</details>

他们为我的圣诞节或生日花费800美元或更多是很常见的事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's not unusual for them to spend $800 or more on me for Christmas or a birthday.</p>
</details>

顺便说一句，他们也非常慈善，对他们所信仰的事业非常慷慨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And by the way, they're also incredibly charitable and very generous to causes they believe in.</p>
</details>

我的经济状况远不如他们，我需要节俭。

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm nowhere near as well off as they are, and I need to be frugal.</p>
</details>

我努力想出一些他们自己想不到的东西，或者对他们来说独一无二的东西。

Christine: 迈克，这真是一个挑战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is such a challenge, Mike.</p>
</details>

我对此深有同感。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I actually identify with this one a lot.</p>
</details>

我曾遇到过这样的情况，我要给一个比我赚更多钱或者什么都不缺的人送礼物。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I have been in the situation where I'm gifting something for somebody who makes a lot more money than me or they don't want for anything.</p>
</details>

### 为富裕但低调的朋友挑选礼物

Hannah: 我们经常收到这样的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We get this one a lot.</p>
</details>

所以，我很高兴迈克打电话来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I'm happy that Mike called.</p>
</details>

而且，迈克，我也来自缅因州。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I also am from Maine, Mike.</p>
</details>

所以，如果你随时想把我介绍给你的朋友，我非常乐意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if you want to introduce me to your friends at any time, I'm really down.</p>
</details>

没问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's no problem.</p>
</details>

我们可以一起聚聚。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We can just get together.</p>
</details>

我们从那里开始。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We'll start with that.</p>
</details>

所以，这里有几件事我想到了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So a couple things come to mind here.</p>
</details>

当你给一个比你富有的人送礼物时，考虑那些真正值得信赖的**传统品牌**（Heritage Brands: 指那些拥有悠久历史、卓越品质和独特文化传承的品牌）是一个非常好的起点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thinking about really like trusted heritage brands is a really good starting point when you're gifting someone who has more money.</p>
</details>

我想到的是**Pendleton**（Pendleton: 美国著名的羊毛制品和服装品牌，以其高品质的毯子和传统图案闻名），我指的是**L.L.Bean**（L.L.Bean: 美国一家历史悠久的户外用品和服装零售商，以其耐用产品和经典设计著称）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I'm thinking Pendleton, I'm talking LLBAN. I'm talking these really trusted brands that you can go to and you could get a smaller item that still really has that sort of quality and value that people could really trust.</p>
</details>

我指的是这些真正值得信赖的品牌，你可以去那里买一件小件物品，它仍然具有人们真正可以信任的品质和价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm talking these really trusted brands that you can go to and you could get a smaller item that still really has that sort of quality and value that people could really trust.</p>
</details>

我认为另一件要考虑的事情是礼物的材质。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think another thing to think about is the material of the gift that you're giving.</p>
</details>

所以，我们谈论的是羊毛、棉花、铜、珐琅。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So like we're talking wool, we're talking cotton, we're talking copper, we're talking enamel.</p>
</details>

想想那些能持续很长时间，本身就具有内在价值的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Think about things that will like last a really long time that have sort of like an inherent value to them.</p>
</details>

这些东西不一定很贵。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Those things don't have to be expensive.</p>
</details>

对于迈克，我想到**Pendleton**有一款非常好的100美元棉质毯子，我们今年一直在测试，我们非常喜欢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For Mike, I was thinking about Pendleton has a really nice $100 cotton throw that we were testing this year that we really like.</p>
</details>

它有几种很棒的图案。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It comes in a couple great patterns.</p>
</details>

我当时在想那个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was thinking about that.</p>
</details>

我喜欢**Falcon Enamelware**（Falcon Enamelware: 英国著名的珐琅餐具品牌）的投手和杯子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I love the Falcon Enamel Wear pitcher and tumblers.</p>
</details>

所以，如果迈克发现自己和这些人有聚会，它们不贵，而且非常漂亮。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, like if Mike finds himself having like get togethers with these people, they're not expensive and they're so lovely to behold and you know, he could bring those over and it could be for like lemonade in the summer or it could hold flowers.</p>
</details>

你知道，他可以把它们带过去，夏天可以用来装柠檬水，或者可以插花。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know, he could bring those over and it could be for like lemonade in the summer or it could hold flowers.</p>
</details>

另一件事，迈克来自缅因州，显然**L.L.Bean**，我想不出谁不需要另一个船用手提袋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other thing, Mike being from Maine, obviously LLBA, like I can't think of anyone who couldn't use another boat tote with a you know,</p>
</details>

Christine: 你被要求至少有三四个，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you're you're required to have at least three or four as mayors, right?</p>
</details>

Hannah: 没错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's correct.</p>
</details>

就像你进入这个州时，他们会给你一个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's like when you come into the state, they give you um and then this really weird one came to mind, Mike, that we've seen this year that we have in a couple gift guides, which is the main shakers make a handmade parlor broom.</p>
</details>

然后，迈克，我想到一个非常奇怪的，我们今年见过，并且在几个礼品指南中都有推荐，那就是**Maine Shakers**（Maine Shakers: 缅因州一家以手工制作传统家具和家居用品而闻名的品牌）制作的手工客厅扫帚。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then this really weird one came to mind, Mike, that we've seen this year that we have in a couple gift guides, which is the main shakers make a handmade parlor broom.</p>
</details>

所以，它就是一把漂亮的手工扫帚。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it's just a beautiful handmade broom.</p>
</details>

你可以在网上购买。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can buy it online.</p>
</details>

我想大约100美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's around $100.</p>
</details>

所以，我只是觉得它会成为最可爱的礼物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, and I just think it would make the most lovely gift.</p>
</details>

几年前有人送给我一个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Someone gave it to me a couple years back.</p>
</details>

它制作得非常好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is so wellm made.</p>
</details>

它只是把一项繁琐的任务变成了一种，我不知道，有点高雅的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It just makes sort of like an arduous task into something like I don't know kind of elevated.</p>
</details>

所以是**Maine Shakers**客厅扫帚。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So main shaker parlor room.</p>
</details>

然后迈克，另一个想法是这个来自缅因州的**Bram Mountain**（Bram Mountain: 缅因州一家生产高品质棉毯的品牌）品牌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then another thought Mike for you is this Bram Mountain brand which comes from Maine.</p>
</details>

他们也制作棉毯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They make cotton blankets as well.</p>
</details>

他们的基础款毯子真的非常可爱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Their base level throw is really really lovely.</p>
</details>

我想不出你如此珍视的人如果还没有的话，他们会不喜欢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I can't think of if the people that you cherish so much don't already have one.</p>
</details>

我认为他们会喜欢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think they'd love one.</p>
</details>

Christine: 我喜欢你专注于一些缅因州的礼物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I like that you focused on some Maine gifts.</p>
</details>

所以这可能也是一个主意，因为几乎每个州都会有一些自己的**传统品牌**。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that might also be an idea because pretty much any state is going to have some kind of heritage brand coming out of it.</p>
</details>

所以我觉得这很好也很体贴。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think that's nice and thoughtful, too.</p>
</details>

### 当对方说“什么都不需要”时怎么办？

Christine: 当有人明确地说：“我什么都不需要。别送我任何礼物。我很好。”你会听他们的吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What do you do in the scenario when somebody just absolutely says, "I don't need anything. Don't gift me anything. I'm good." Do you listen to them?</p>
</details>

如果你仍然觉得有必要送礼物怎么办？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What if you feel compelled to give a gift still?</p>
</details>

我认为很多人都为此挣扎，当有人说：“我真的什么都不需要。”也许是姻亲或他们的父母，或者其他什么人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think a lot of people struggle with that where someone's saying like, "I don't really need anything." Maybe it's like an in-law or their parent or something,</p>
</details>

但他们仍然觉得有这种，我不知道，送礼的社会期望。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but then they still feel this, I don't know, societal expectation to give a gift.</p>
</details>

Hannah: 我确实会回到认真倾听，听他们说什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I do go back into really good listening, hearing what they're saying.</p>
</details>

我还会更进一步，那就是观察力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I also go into another level of that, which is like power of observation.</p>
</details>

所以，如果你在他们家里，我会四处看看。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, if you're in their home, I'm looking around.</p>
</details>

我看看他们有什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm seeing what they have.</p>
</details>

我看看也许我们可以对他们已有的东西进行一些升级，我们可以做得更好一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm seeing what maybe we could do like a little upgrade on something that they have, but we could do a little better.</p>
</details>

如果你在他们家吃饭，有一个托盘，上面有一个缺口，我们是不是要买一个新的托盘？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you're having dinner at their house and there's a serving tray and it has a chip in it, are we getting a new serving tray?</p>
</details>

他们是否注意到你有什么东西，然后说：“哦，天哪，我喜欢你的包。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Have they sort of noticed something that you have and been like, "Oh gosh, I love your bag."</p>
</details>

尝试升级他们可能已经拥有的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Try to get into upgrading things that they might already have.</p>
</details>

然后，对于那些说他们不想要礼物的人，我认为升级版的日常用品也是一个很棒的主意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then I also really for people that say they don't want a gift, I think a upgraded staple is another great idea.</p>
</details>

每个人都绝对会用的东西，但你可以给他们买那个东西的最好版本。

<p class="english-text">Things that absolutely everybody uses, but you could get them the very best version of that thing.</p>
</details>

Christine: 给我举些例子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Give me some examples.</p>
</details>

Hannah: 我只是觉得，我看到我的姐姐，愿她一切安好，他们家里有那么多劣质的咖啡杯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I just feel like I see like my sister, bless her little heart, they have so many junky coffee tumblers in their house.</p>
</details>

整个柜子里都是糟糕透顶的咖啡杯，我想都是通过工作或其他途径得到的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a whole cabinet of horrible, horrible coffee tumblers that I think have been gifted through work and through I don't know.</p>
</details>

我的姐姐难道不喜欢一个漂亮、完美、不漏水的咖啡杯吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wouldn't my sister love a beautiful, perfect, non-leaking coffee tumbler that could just be perfect, fit in any cup hold, not falling over every two seconds?</p>
</details>

它能完美地放入任何杯架，不会每两秒钟就倒下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">fit in any cup hold, not falling over every two seconds?</p>
</details>

所以，就像这样的东西，你可以给他们买**Wirecutter**推荐的日常用品中最好的那一款。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, like things like that where you could just get them the wire cutter pick of a sort of everyday item and just give them like the absolute best one.</p>
</details>

Christine: 汉娜，我们还有一个最后一个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hannah, we have one final question.</p>
</details>

这个问题来自唐，她正在询问如何为她的同事挑选礼物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, this one is from Don, who is asking about gifting for her colleagues.</p>
</details>

让我们听听。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's listen.</p>
</details>

Don: 大家好，我是来自华盛顿州西雅图的唐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hi, I'm Don from Seattle, Washington.</p>
</details>

当我做销售的时候，我的经理总是在假期期间送礼物，比如**Goldbelly**（Goldbelly: 一个在线美食平台，提供来自全国各地著名餐厅和食品商的特色食品）的蛋糕或者**Harry & David**（Harry & David: 美国一家著名的礼品篮和美食公司）的礼品盒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When I was doing sales, my manager always sent a gift around the holidays, and it was something like a cake from Gold Belly or a Harry and David gift box.</p>
</details>

感觉就像是从企业礼品目录里选出来的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, something that just felt like it was out of a corporate giving catalog.</p>
</details>

我一直以为那是公司支付的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I always assumed that it was paid for by my company.</p>
</details>

但现在我是一名经理了，我才知道没有送礼预算，任何我想送的东西都得自掏腰包。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But now that I am a manager, I've learned there is no budget for gift giving and anything I want to send comes out of my own pocket.</p>
</details>

而且我们工作上也发生了一些变化，以前的经理管理8到10人，而我管理30人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But we've also had some changes at work and where my previous managers have had 8 to 10 people that they manage and I manage 30.</p>
</details>

给他们每个人送一个80美元的礼品篮是不现实的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's just not reasonable to send them all an $80 gift basket.</p>
</details>

我感到很困扰，因为我知道每个人都在期待一些东西，而我做的任何比他们以前收到的礼物差的事情，他们都会觉得好像被剥夺了什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I feel stuck because I know everyone's expecting something and anything that I do that's less than what they've had before, they're going to feel like something is taken away.</p>
</details>

所以，任何帮助都将不胜感激。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
</details>

谢谢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you.</p>
</details>

Christine: 好的，唐，我们首先需要谈谈你为什么有30个下属？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, Don, we first need to talk about why do you have 30 reports?</p>
</details>

首先，这下属数量太多了，但我们会跳过这个问题，直接解决真正的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's way too many reports, first of all, but we will skip over that and get to the real problem.</p>
</details>

那么，汉娜，我们该为唐做些什么呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, Hannah, what do we do for Don?</p>
</details>

### 给同事挑选礼物

Hannah: 我很高兴唐打电话来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm so glad that Don called.</p>
</details>

正如唐提到的，你不想让它感觉很普通，或者像是从企业目录里选出来的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As Don brought up, you don't want it to feel generic or like from a corporate catalog.</p>
</details>

所以，我讨厌给出这个建议，但我们谈论的是知名品牌，唐。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, like I hate to give this advice, but like we're talking name brands, Don.</p>
</details>

我们谈论的是**Bagu**（Bagu: 一个以时尚、环保购物袋和配饰闻名的品牌），我们谈论的是**Stanley**（Stanley: 一个以其耐用保温杯和水瓶而闻名的品牌），**Hydro Flask**（Hydro Flask: 一个以其高质量保温瓶和水瓶而闻名的品牌）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're talking Bagu, we're talking Stanley, Hydro Flask.</p>
</details>

一个可识别的品牌对人们来说会是一件非常好的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A recognizable brand could be a really nice thing for people.</p>
</details>

我确实认为**Bagu**制作小袋子，每个人都可以使用这样的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I do think that Bagu makes like pouches and everyone can use things like that.</p>
</details>

我已经提到了咖啡杯和水瓶，但我确实认为人们会欣赏高质量的版本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've already mentioned coffee tumblers and water bottles, but I do think people appreciate high quality versions of that.</p>
</details>

我也在这个时候想到科技产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I also think about tech in this moment.</p>
</details>

有一种非常棒的旅行充电器，叫做**Travel Card One Word Charger Plus**（Travel Card One Word Charger Plus: 一款信用卡大小的便携式多设备充电器）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's this really great travel charger called the you know this one.</p>
</details>

你肯定知道这个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I just love it.</p>
</details>

我就是喜欢它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a great gift and if Don hasn't heard of it, she should do it.</p>
</details>

它是一个很棒的礼物，如果唐没听说过，她应该试试。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a great gift and if Don hasn't heard of it, she should do it.</p>
</details>

我认为它的价格很划算。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's a sharp price.</p>
</details>

**Travel Card One Word Charger Plus**我相信是他们现在使用的版本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The travel card one word charger I believe plus is the version that they're using now.</p>
</details>

它有多种颜色可供选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It comes in a range of colors.</p>
</details>

你可以为多种设备充电。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can charge a range of devices.</p>
</details>

它像信用卡一样薄。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's as thin as a credit card.</p>
</details>

那会是一个很棒的礼物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That would be an awesome gift.</p>
</details>

所以，考虑这样的小东西可以升级日常生活。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So thinking of small little things like that could upgrade everyday lives.</p>
</details>

我还认为旅行是一个非常好的思考方向，当你考虑为你的下属挑选礼物时，因为它承认了工作之外的日常生活。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I also think that travel is a really nice thing to think about when you're thinking about the people that work for you because I think it acknowledges a life outside of your day-to-day with work.</p>
</details>

几年前，我工作的杂志主编送给我一个护照夹，一个皮质护照夹。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Years ago, I was gifted by the sort of editor-in chief of the magazine. I was working a passport cover, a leather passport cover, and we recommend it to this day at Wire Cutter because I still carry it.</p>
</details>

我们至今仍在**Wirecutter**推荐它，因为我仍然在使用它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and we recommend it to this day at Wire Cutter because I still carry it.</p>
</details>

这个品牌是**Tusk**（Tusk: 一个以其高品质皮革制品，尤其是旅行配件而闻名的品牌）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The brand is Tusk.</p>
</details>

它也有多种颜色，漂亮的行李牌，万能旅行适配器，这些可爱的小旅行用品，我认为也是很棒的礼物。

<p class="english-text">comes in again a range of colors, nice luggage tags, universal travel adapters, little travel dudads that are lovely, I think are also a really good vein of awesome gifts.</p>
</details>

我喜欢这个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I love that.</p>
</details>

那消耗品呢，唐？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What about consumables for Don?</p>
</details>

你知道，她提到了过去收到的一系列礼品篮，我认为这在这种情况下是一种常见的礼物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, she mentioned a range of sort of gift baskets she's received in the past and I think that's a common gift in this kind of scenario.</p>
</details>

你有什么消耗品礼物可以推荐给她吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Are there any of our consumable gifts that you would recommend for her?</p>
</details>

我想到的是，也许是那些能解决她想要呈现一些看起来更高级、更昂贵，但实际上花费不多的礼物的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm thinking like maybe things that address this issue that she has of like wanting to present something that maybe seems nicer and more expensive than she's actually spending.</p>
</details>

与其送完整的礼品篮，不如送一些随机的、装有惊人美味的小罐子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Rather than going to like full on gift baskets, gifting random little tins of amazing things.</p>
</details>

去年我们推荐了一种薯片，每个人都为之疯狂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So last year we recommended this can of chips that everyone was going crazy for.</p>
</details>

今年有一种漂亮的法国罐装芥末。

它装在一个小桶里，你见过吗？

</details>

它真是太美味、有层次感、复杂了。

</details>

它是用香槟葡萄的压榨物制成的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's made with like the press from Champagne Grapes.</p>
</details>

它真的很可爱，而且不到20美元，也有管状包装。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's really lovely and under 20 bucks that also comes in a tube.</p>
</details>

我们有这些非常棒的凤尾鱼酿橄榄，人们都为之疯狂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have these really wonderful anchovy stuffed olives that people go crazy for.</p>
</details>

有一种令人难以置信的糖渍樱桃品牌，叫做**Luxardo樱桃**（Luxardo樱桃：一种意大利产的糖渍樱桃，常用于鸡尾酒和甜点）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's this brand of unbelievable merated cherries called Luxardo Cherries.</p>
</details>

所以，你喜欢**Luxardo樱桃**鸡尾酒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, um you love Luxardo Cherries cocktails.</p>
</details>

所以，与其送完整的礼品篮，不如送这些一次性的、非常高级、非常可爱的小罐子或小盒子里装的美味东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, rather than doing full-on gift basket, you could do these sort of like oneoff little very elevated, very lovely little jars or cans of delightful things.</p>
</details>

我认为这也是一个非常好的主意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that's an really nice idea as well.</p>
</details>

Christine: 汉娜，你的团队全年都在世界各地寻找好礼物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hannah, your team spends all year just canvasing the world for great gifts.</p>
</details>

我很好奇今年你有没有推荐一些让你非常非常兴奋的新礼物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm curious if there are any new gifts that you're recommending this year that you're really, really excited about.</p>
</details>

### 2025年最新推荐礼物

Hannah: 绝对有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely.</p>
</details>

很多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So many.</p>
</details>

我看到了这个**Block Design**（Block Design: 一个以其简约、功能性家居用品和礼品而闻名的品牌）品牌的可翻转玻璃花瓶。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I saw this block design is the brand reversible glass vase.</p>
</details>

所以，如果你把它朝一个方向放置，你可以在中间的小容器里放一朵花；如果你把它朝另一个方向放置，你就会有一个更宽的边缘，可以放一个更大的花束。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if if you sit it one way, you can put like a single bloom in the like little vessel down the center and if you set it the other way, you have like a wider rim with which to put a bigger bouquet.</p>
</details>

我只是觉得它的新颖性和实用性都非常棒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I just think the like novelty of that and the practicality of that is so great.</p>
</details>

而且它本身就足够漂亮，即使没有花也可以单独摆放。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's pretty enough that it could just sit on its own as well.</p>
</details>

我认为花瓶的另一个优点是，即使里面没有花，你仍然可以欣赏它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that's also nice with a vase is if it if you don't have flowers in it, you can still enjoy looking at it.</p>
</details>

对于儿童礼物，我们看到了这些**Japanese Craypaws**（Japanese Craypaws: 一种日本产的艺术材料，介于蜡笔和颜料之间，易于涂抹和混合）。

<p class="english-text">For a kids gift, we saw these Japanese cray paws.</p>

</details>

Hannah: 谢谢你问。

<details>

我也认为它们对成年人来说也很棒。

</details>

它们装在一个非常漂亮的小盒子里。

我认为任何有绘画或艺术表达欲望的人，这都是一个非常好的选择。

<p class="english-text">And I think anyone that sort of has this like desire to paint or sort of express themselves artistically, I think it's a really nice offering.</p>

而且它们可以在普通的唱片机上播放。
