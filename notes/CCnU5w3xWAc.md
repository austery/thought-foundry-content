### 节目介绍与新书《他一半的年龄》

**Anna Martin**: 大家好，我是来自《**纽约时报**》的**Anna Martin**，这里是“**现代爱情**”节目。今天我将与**珍妮特·麦柯迪**对话。珍妮特几乎是在观众的注视下长大的，她曾是**Nickelodeon**的明星，你可能从**iCarly**这部剧认识她。但在幕后，她一直在挣扎。她在2022年出版的畅销回忆录《**我很高兴我的母亲去世了**》中写下了这一切。现在，她出了一本新书，这是一部小说，名为《**他一半的年龄**》。故事讲述了一个名叫**沃尔多**的17岁女孩和她40岁的老师**柯基先生**之间的关系。关于《他一半的年龄》，最让我印象深刻的是沃尔多和柯基先生之间这种动态关系的复杂性。珍妮特没有美化他们的关系，但她也没有加以评判。珍妮特告诉我，她18岁时曾有过一段年龄差的恋情，而正是通过写作这本书，她才完全理解了当时发生的一切以及她从中吸取的教训。在深入探讨之前，请注意，本集内容可能会有些露骨。所以，如果孩子们在旁边，请稍后再听。珍妮特·麦柯迪，欢迎来到“现代爱情”。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: From the **New York Times**. I'm **Anna Martin**. This is **Modern Love**. Today I'm talking to **Janette McCertie**. Janette pretty much grew up in front of an audience. She was a **Nickelodeon** star. You probably know her from the show **iCarly**. But behind the scenes, she was struggling. And she wrote about all of it in her 2022 bestselling memoir, **I'm Glad My Mom Died**. Now, she has a new book out. It's a novel, and it's called **Half His Age**. And it's a story about a relationship between a 17-year-old girl named **Waldo** and her 40-year-old teacher, **Mr. Corgi**. What hit me about Half His Age is just how complicated this dynamic is between Waldo and Mr. Corgi. Janette does not sugarcoat their relationship, but she also doesn't pass judgment. Janette told me when she was 18, she had her own age gap relationship, and it took writing this book for her to fully come to terms with what happened and what she learned from it. A heads up before we get into it, this episode does get explicit. So, if you're listening with kids around, save this one for later. Janette Mccertie, welcome to Modern Love.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 嗨，安娜。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: Hi, Anna.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 珍妮特，你的第一本书是一本回忆录，在《**纽约时报**》畅销书榜上停留了80多周，书名叫《**我很高兴我的母亲去世了**》。现在你又写了一本新书，名叫《**他一半的年龄**》。这是一部小说，是虚构的，但其中融入了你生活中的一些元素，我们稍后会谈到。不过首先，你能给我介绍一下这本书吗？《他一半的年龄》讲的是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Janette, your first book was a memoir that spent over 80 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. It's called **I'm Glad My Mom Died**. And now you've written a new book called **Half His Age**. It's a novel. It's fiction, but there are elements of your own life that you brought into the story, which we'll get into. First though, why don't you tell me about this book? What is Half His Age about?

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 是的，《**他一半的年龄**》。哇，我现在变得好严肃。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: Yeah. **Half His Age**. Whoa. I got so serious now.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 我喜欢这样。我们可以涵盖所有这些不同的语调，请继续。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: I like that. We can We can span all these different tones. Please.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 我当时想：“这是《**纽约时报**》。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: I was like, "This is the New York Times."

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 为什么它也带点性感呢？有点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Why is it sultry, too? Kind of.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 我喜欢那种氛围。请继续。那感觉确实有点符合《**他一半的年龄**》的主题，对吧？有点性感的氛围。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: I like that vibe. Please. That That feels like it actually kind of fits with what is Half His Age is about, right? A bit of a sultry vibe.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 好的，告诉我吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: All right. Give it to me.

</details>

### 探索女性的愤怒、力量与欲望

**Janette McCertie**: 《**他一半的年龄**》通过一个非常孤独而“贪婪”的17岁女孩的视角，探索了女性的愤怒、力量和欲望。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: So **Half His Age** is an exploration of female rage and power and desire as told through the lens of a very lonely and ravenous 17-year-old girl.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: “贪婪”，这是一个很特别的词。你指的是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: ravenous. That is a specific word. Tell me what you mean by that.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 她极度渴望很多东西，非常非常多。她渴望能让她感觉不像自己的衣服，她渴望能让她感觉不像自己的美妆产品。她渴望一个她认为能让她感觉不像自己的伴侣。她真的非常渴望在生活的许多不同领域寻找身份、慰藉和舒适。她内心深处有这种强烈的渴望。是的，我们甚至可以进一步描述一下场景。主角**沃尔多**17岁，住在阿拉斯加。她的家庭状况如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: She wants desperately so many things. So many things. She wants clothing that will make her feel like someone other than she is. She wants beauty items that she thinks will make her feel like something other than she is. She wants a person who she thinks might make her feel like something other than she is. She's really desperately seeking identity and solace and comfort in many different areas of life. She wants there's this deep well of wanting. Yeah. And let's even sort of set the scene even more. She's she **Waldo**, the main character, is 17. She lives in Alaska. What's her family situation like?

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: **沃尔多**出生时，她的母亲只有16岁，是个青少年妈妈。她的童年是在各种拖车公园里度过的。因此，由于她的处境以及从各种人那里得到的各种信息，她的自尊心并不高。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: So **Waldo** was born to a teen mother. Her mother had her when she was 16 years old and she spent her childhood in various trailer parks. She has not great self-esteem as a result of her circumstances and various messaging that she's gotten from various people.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 她的母亲、社会，现在，当我们在书中见到她时，她正要进入高中最后一年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: her mother, society and now, when we meet her in the book, she's just going into her senior year of high school.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 正是在学校里，我们遇到了这本书的另一个主要人物，**柯基先生**。跟我说说柯基先生吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: And it's in school that we meet the other main character of this book **Mr. Corgi**. Tell me about Mr. Corgi.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 柯基先生，我……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: **Mr. Corgi** I I

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 停顿一下。我们从何说起呢？不，你知道，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: pause. Where do we begin? No, you know,

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 我可以用两种方式回答这个问题。一种是那种，你知道，抨击他、为**沃尔多**辩护并保护沃尔多，这是我的一种本能。另一种则是更多地去同情他，在他身上找到人性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: there's two ways that I could answer this. And one is this sort of, you know, skewering him and defending Waldo and protecting Waldo, which is one instinct that I have. And the other is to more to empathize with him and to find the humanity in him. And

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 尽管在写作过程中这很有挑战性，但这最终变得非常非常关键，这样他就不会显得过于邪恶或，你知道，完全是反派。所以，**柯基先生**，如果我试着去同情他，他是一个40岁的创意写作老师，有很多失败的梦想。他为自己设定的梦想都没有实现。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: as challenging as that was kind of throughout the writing process, that wound up being really really pivotal so that he wasn't too mustache twirly or, you know, on then villainous. So **Mr. Corgi**, if I try to touch into my empathy toward him, you know, he's a 40-year-old creative writing teacher who has so many failed dreams. None of his dreams for himself panned out.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 他带着很多悔恨和失望生活着。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: He's living with a lot of regret and a lot of disappointment.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 大部分都未经处理。他只是日复一日地勉强维持着，履行着作为丈夫、父亲和老师的职责和义务，努力让自己感觉良好，尽管他对自己未能达到人生期望感到羞耻。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: Most of that unprocessed. He's just kind of chugging along, going through the dayto-day, fulfilling his duties and obligations as a husband, as a father, as a teacher, and trying to feel okay with himself despite really feeling shame about not living up to his expectations for the life that he wanted for himself.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 很多人看不到这一点，但我很荣幸能看到你闭着眼睛。对我来说很清楚，你正在进入他的内心世界。你所说的同情心，我认为非常引人注目，也非常重要。因为17岁的**沃尔多**和40多岁的**柯基先生**，他们开始了一段性爱和浪漫关系，一段深刻的亲密关系，这本书的其余部分探索了这段关系的高潮、低谷以及对他们两人生活的影响。请再多告诉我一些你说的。你有两种方式看待他，一种是评判，另一种是你所体现的同情心，你说这在写作这本书时是一个挣扎。请再多告诉我一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: I mean, people, you know, can't see this, but I have the the pleasure of you're you're closing your eyes. I mean, it's clear to me that you're inhabiting his mind. And what you said about empathy, I think, is so striking and so important because **Waldo**, 17, **Mr. Corgi**, you know, 40some, they begin a a sexual and and a romantic relationship, a deeply intimate relationship that the rest of the book explore sort of the peaks and the valleys and the fallout of, you know, in in both of their lives. Tell me more about what you said. There's these two ways you could look at him as a you know what was the f it was like to really judge and then the other was this empathy that you embodied and you said that was a struggle when you were writing this book. Tell me a little bit more about that.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 是的，我写这部小说经历了许多草稿，在最初的草稿中，我把**柯基先生**写得过于直白，过于反派。我认为那是我作为作者的干预，因为我想保护**沃尔多**，因为我对她充满了爱和同情，而对柯基先生则没有那么多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: Yeah, I went through so many drafts of this novel and in the beginning drafts I really wrote Corgi as too on the nose, as too villainous. And I think that was me as a as an author interfering because I wanted to protect Waldo because I felt so much love and compassion for her and not as much for Corgi.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 我对他有那些评判，我认为那是一种非常容易产生的、你知道，当你遇到这种情况下的人时，你会有的第一稿的评判。然后当我回读那些草稿时，我意识到他读起来根本不真实，不可信。最终，因为他读起来是那样，那对作为叙述者的**沃尔多**来说是一种伤害。这让她显得不那么可信，让她变得不可靠，因为你会想：“她为什么会喜欢这个人？她喜欢他什么？”如果她被否定，我就会失去这部小说。所以，我必须深入其中，努力真正地同情他，真正地找到对他的同情心，真正地感受身处他那种位置的现实，以及身处**沃尔多**那种位置的现实。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: I had those judgments toward him that I think are the very easy kind of, you know, first draft judgments that you're going to have of a person in this kind of a situation. And then when I would read those drafts back, I realized he just did not read grounded. He did not read believable. And ultimately, because he was reading that way, that was a disservice to Waldo as a narrator. It made her less credible. It made her unreliable because you're going, "Well, why is why does she even like this person? What does she like about him?" And for her to to be discredited, if she were discredited, I would lose the novel. So, I had to go in and try to really empathize with him, really find that compassion for him, and really feel into the reality of being someone in his position and the reality of being Waldo.

</details>

### 17岁少女的内心世界

**Anna Martin**: 这本书是通过**沃尔多**这个17岁女孩的视角讲述的。我们真的置身于那个17岁的大脑中。我认为你非常出色地把握住了那个年龄段的特点。它非常有效，实际上让我感到很不舒服。你真的抓住了那种有趣的、充满活力的，既有虚张声势又有不安全感的混合体。你描述了沃尔多如何化妆，就像是一种保护，一种盔甲，但她从不满足。她通过网上购物尝试新的身份，她讨厌学校里的人，但又有点想成为他们。我们真的置身于青少年大脑这种强烈波动的状态中。为什么你认为通过沃尔多而不是一个第三人称叙述者来讲述这个故事很重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: This book is told through **Waldo**'s perspective, this 17-year-old. We're really in that 17-year-old brain. I think you did a remarkable job of inhabiting that age. It was so effective. It was actually quite uncomfortable for me. like you really hit that funny fizzy mix of like bravado and insecurity. The way that you describe how Waldo puts on her makeup like it's protection, like it's armor, but she's never satisfied. All the online shopping to kind of try on new identities, how she hates the people in school, but also sort of wants to be them. It's like we're really inhabiting this kind of intense fluctuation of the teenage brain. Why was it important for you to tell this story through Waldo's perspective instead of I don't know like a like a third person narrator telling this story?

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 我也想回到你的不适感。我非常好奇，每当有人提到不适感时，我都会感兴趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: I also want to circle back to your discomfort. I have I'm so curious about about anytime somebody brings up discomfort. I'm interested.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 哦，天哪。问我一个问题。我喜欢。是的，我的意思是，关于我为什么感到不舒服？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Oh my god. Ask me a question. I love that. What? Yeah. I mean in terms of like why was I uncomfortable?

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 是的。哦，天哪。嗯，我想就是我所指的。就像我记得自己在这个年纪时，会同时觉得自己很棒又觉得自己很糟糕。你明白我的意思吗？就像那真的是一种过山车般的时刻，不是日复一日，而是真真切切地在一天中的许多时刻，我都会想：

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Yes. Oh my gosh. Well, I think it's it's what I'm point it's. Like I remember being this age and kind of simultaneously thinking I was the [ __ ] and thinking I was [ __ ] Do you know what I mean? Like it was just this this real roller coaster moment to moment. Not even dayto day. Just like truly many moments in the day where I was like,

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 你知道，我懂很多。我很成熟。哦，天哪，我，你知道，我什么都不懂。就像这种对自我身份的不断摇摆。我感觉我没有一个核心或中心。而且，你知道，谈到你对**沃尔多**所说的渴望。天哪，我渴望很多。所以，我只是觉得你把我置于那种不稳定的状态，这是我脑海中出现的词，但我并不是以评判的方式说。我只是指那种，是的，那种不安全感和虚张声势的强烈感受。那把我带回了那个时候。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: you know, I know stuff. I'm mature. Oh my gosh, I'm you know, I don't know anything. Like this just this constant vacasillation of my identity. I feel like I didn't have a core or a center. And you know, speak about the wanting that you said with Waldo. My gosh, I wanted so much. So, I just I feel like you put me in that unstable is the word that comes to mind, but I don't mean that in a judgmental way either. I just mean like this kind of Yeah. electric feelings of of insecurity and bravado. That That's what it brought me back to.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: Yeah.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 太有趣了。我也觉得“不稳定”是完美的词。我觉得17岁时没有人是稳定的。有太多的内在不稳定和不确定性。你不知道一切会走向何方。17岁真的太不舒服了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: So interesting. I also I feel like unstable is the perfect word. I feel like nobody's stable at 17. There's so much inherent instability and uncertainty. You don't know where anything is going to land. It is so uncomfortable to be 17.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 是的。那么，你是怎么做到的？我只想问，你作为一个……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: It is. Well, how did you get Let me just ask like how did you as a

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 抱歉，对这个年纪的人来说有点粗鲁，但根据我的研究，你33岁，对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Sorry, rude to someone their age, but from my research, you're 33. Is that correct?

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 我31岁。好的，我们都是朋友。那么，回到17岁时的视角是什么感觉？你是怎么做到的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: I'm 31. Okay. So, we're all friends here. The What was it like to put yourself back in that 17-year-old perspect? How did you do it?

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 嗯，也许这就是我与17岁孩子最相关的方式，我总是说，如果情绪是1到10的量表，我真的感觉不到8以下的任何情绪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: Well, maybe this is the way I relate to a 17-year-old most is that I always say if emotions are on a scale of a 1 to a 10, I don't really feel anything beneath an eight.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 等一下，现在我们不是在说17岁的你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Like, wait, now we're not going 17-year-old you.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 不，现在我是一个感受者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: No, now now I'm a feeler.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Mhm.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 我是一个非常感性的人，你知道，我很敏感，为此挣扎了很长时间。现在，你知道，我对此感到释然，而且这并非没有挑战。它当然会有挑战，但我一直都是这样。所以，我认为这有点像17岁的一个元素。但那种极端的感受，我肯定不再有那种感觉了。感谢上帝。哦，天哪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: I'm such a feeler. I'm so you know, sensitive and fought that for a long time. Now I'm you know, I'm okay with it and and it's not that it's not ever challenging. It certainly can be, but I've always been this way. And so, I think that's kind of an element of being 17. But the the real extremes I definitely don't relate to anymore. Thank God. Oh my lord.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 嗯，那种感觉，你描述的日复一日的叙事鞭打感。我糟透了。我最棒了。你知道，是的。它，它……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: Um, and the feeling the the kind of what you're describing of the whiplash of narratives dayto day. I'm the worst. I I'm the best. You know, yeah. It's it's um

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 相当令人迷失，相当混乱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: quite disorienting, quite chaotic,

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 你知道，我，我，我不知道该怎么形容，除了我当时实际上，好的，我当时实际上正在写另一部小说。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: and You know, it's I I I don't know how to describe it other than it was just I was actually okay. I was actually writing another novel.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 哦，天哪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Oh my gosh.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 但那是一种，我觉得想法这种东西就是这样。就像做一个项目就像谈恋爱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: But it was something I feel like this thing happens with ideas. Um where it's like working on a project is like being in a relationship.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 刚开始是蜜月期，很棒，很性感，很火热，是最好的事情。然后它就变成了工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: And in the beginning, it's the honeymoon phase and it's amazing and it's sexy and it's hot and it's the greatest thing. And then it becomes work.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 完全正确。当它变成工作时，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Totally. And when it becomes work,

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 你所有其他的小想法都开始变得非常诱人，你会想：“嗯，如果我跟他们约会呢？我能不能很快地跟他们约一次会？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: all your other little ideas start looking real hot and you're going, "Well, what if I dated them? Could I just take them out on one date real quick?"

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 所以，我当时已经深入到另一部小说中，然后《**他一半的年龄**》就开始自己冒出来了。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: So, I was pretty deep in this other novel and then **Half His Age** just started pushing itself up on me. Yeah.

</details>

### 写作与未处理的愤怒

**Janette McCertie**: 我的意思是，**沃尔多**的声音开始特别强烈地向我涌来，她会说的话，以及这种压倒性的、几乎是愤怒的冲动会涌遍我的全身，我想，你知道，沃尔多的大部分特点是她压抑着自己的愤怒，我认为那是她故事弧线的一个关键元素。是的，你在整本书中确实感受到了沃尔多非常愤怒，我认为那是一种相当强大的情感，你知道，从沃尔多的角度来看。我们感受到了这种愤怒，对她的处境的愤怒，对**柯基先生**的愤怒。你知道，关于这个故事的另一件重要事情是，在与柯基先生的肉体关系中，是沃尔多先采取了行动。你能跟我谈谈这个选择吗？比如，这对你来说重要吗？如果重要，为什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: And what I mean by that is that **Waldo**'s voice specifically started really pushing itself up on me and lines that she would say and just sort of this overwhelming almost flush of anger kind of would surge through my body which is I think you know much of Waldo is really she's suppressing her anger and I think that's really a a a key element of her arc. Yeah, you do get that sense throughout the book that Waldo is very angry and I think that's a quite powerful emotion, you know, to to experience from from Waldo's point of view. We get this sense of anger, anger towards her situation, anger towards **Mr. Corgi**. You know, another thing too about this account that I think is important is that in this physical relationship with Mr. Corgi, it's Waldo who makes the first move. Can you talk to me about that choice? Like, was that important to you? And if so, why?

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 这对我来说非常重要，让**沃尔多**非常积极、主动、坚决、大胆，因为归根结底，她仍然只有17岁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: It was so important to me that Waldo be very aggressive, very forward, very adamant, very bold, because ultimately she is still 17.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 无论她以何种方式推动、坚持、将自己插入到这个人身上、这种动态中，她都只有17岁。我真的努力在写作这本书时，不带有道德说教或指责的意味。而现在我却要变得道德说教了。嗯，我设法写了300页，现在一切都出来了，我的朋友。现在一切都出来了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: This in whatever ways she pushes, asserts, inserts herself onto this person, into this dynamic, she's 17. And I and I really tried not to be, you know, moralistic or or finger waggy in the writing of the book. And here I am about to get moralistic. Um, I managed to go 300 pages and now it all comes out, my friend. Now it all comes out.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 但你知道，这就像，无论这个女孩做什么，无论她怎么做，她可以扑倒在他脚下，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: But you know, it is it's like no matter what this girl does, no matter how she she could throw herself at his feet,

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 他仍然40岁，他仍然是我们的老师。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: he's still 40 and he's still our teacher.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 如果**柯基先生**先采取行动，那个故事会有什么不同？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: If **Mr. Corgi** had made the first move. What would be different about that story?

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 我认为那会是一个更容易的故事。嗯，我认为那会是一个你可以更快地贴上评判标签的故事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: I think it would be an easier story. Um, I think it would be one where you can label judgment a lot quicker.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 你可以在某种程度上直接否定**柯基先生**和**沃尔多**，你可以立即把他们归类，然后说：“好的，我知道这个故事是什么了。我知道我知道这会是什么。”你知道，说实话，你那时就可以合上书了。你不需要读它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: and you can write off both Corgi and Waldo in a sense and you can kind of instantly put them into these boxes and go, "Okay, I know what this story is. I know I know what this is going to be." You know, you really I think you could close the book at that point to be honest. You wouldn't need to read it.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 是的。是的。那样在道德上会非常清晰，但相反地，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Yeah. Yeah. It would be very clear morally, but instead

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 你选择写了这本书，我们已经说过“不舒服”这个词，它更多地存在于一种灰色地带，因为**沃尔多**渴望，沃尔多渴望他，甚至在那些性爱场景中，我的意思是，那里有一种真正的相互性，对吧？不是一个人在追求另一个人。他们都渴望彼此。在《**他一半的年龄**》中有一段引文，沃尔多说：“性是唯一一个我的需求不会太大，我所有的渴望都被接受的地方。唯一一个我可以展示我内心深处有多么渴望的地方。唯一一个我可以乞求、抱怨和尖叫着让它被填满的地方。”所以，这就像性是她渴望的体现，是这种我们谈论过的永不满足的需求。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: you chose to write this book that I we've said the word uncomfortable that exists like much more in sort of a gray area because **Waldo** wants like Waldo wants him and and even in these sex scenes, I mean, there's like a real kind of mutuality there, right? It's not just one person pursuing the other. They're both hungry for each other. There's this quote from **Half His Age** where Waldo says, "Sex is the one place where my needs aren't too big and all of my yearning is acceptable. The one place where I can show how deep the well is within me. The one place I can beg and whine and scream to have it filled." So it's like sexes is is this representation of her wanting of this kind of unquenchable need as we've talked about.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 绝对如此。我认为这对于年轻女性来说是一种非常普遍的经历。这当然是我的经历。这当然是我所有女性朋友的经历。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: Definitely. I think that's such a common experience for young women. It was certainly my experience. It was certainly the experience of literally every one of my female friends.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 提出来吧。这非常，你知道，在那个年纪，我们不一定知道如何，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Bring it up. It's very and it's like, you know, at that age, we don't necessarily know how to

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 甚至承认我们的需求，更不用说向别人表达了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: maybe even acknowledge our needs, let alone articulate them to somebody else.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 情感需求，不是……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Emotional needs, not

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 情感需求。完全正确。完全正确。所以，我认为性就像一个替代品，或者说我们认为可以承载我们所有需求的东西。我们认为，好吧，你知道，我希望他对我好一点，多花点时间陪我，嗯，你知道，承认我的情感。嗯，相反，他能不能就满足我呢？因为那是我认为我唯一能得到的？也许那是我认为我唯一的价值。也许，也许我只是还不知道如何表达那些其他的需求。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: emotional needs. Exactly. Exactly. And so I think sex kind of acts as this placeholder or this thing that we think can house all of our needs that we think, okay, well, you know, I want him to treat me better, to make more time for me, to um, you know, acknowledge my emotions. Uh, instead, well, can he just [ __ ] me because that's all I think I can get? Maybe that's all I think I'm worth. Maybe maybe I just don't know how to vocalize those other needs yet.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 在其他采访中，你曾分享过你大约18岁时有过一段年龄差的恋情。写作《**他一半的年龄**》是你处理那段经历的一种方式吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: In other interviews, you shared that you had an experience with an age gap relationship that started when you were around 18. Was writing **Half His Age** a way to process that experience for you?

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 在某些方面，我想是的。你知道，我绝对认为那个重叠的种子是这部小说的起点。当然，你知道，**沃尔多**是她自己的角色，《**他一半的年龄**》也是它自己的故事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: In some ways, I think so. You know, I definitely think that seed of that overlap was the jumping off point for the novel. And then of course, you know, Waldo's her own character and and and Half His Age is its own story and and

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 我知道很多人会把我的经历投射到这本书上。我明白。我对此没意见。尽管我确实认为这是一种误读，因为，你知道，**沃尔多**确实是她自己的角色，值得被这样看待。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: I know so many people will project me onto this. I'm aware. I'm fine with that. Although I do think it is a misread because, you know, Waldo truly truly is her own character and deserves to be seen for that.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 但我确实发现写作是我处理那些我过去可能没有完全处理的事情的一种方式。我确实认为写作是我在那些没有得到解决的领域找到解决之道的一种方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: But I do find writing is a way for me to process things that I maybe hadn't processed fully from my past. I do think writing is a way for me to find closure in areas where I didn't have closure.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 嗯，你提到愤怒是吸引你写这本书、进入这个故事的核心情感。所以，似乎你过去的那段经历周围，可能甚至潜意识里，一直存在着愤怒，你可能需要通过写作来处理它。这种感觉真实吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Well, you mentioned that it was anger was the kind of anchoring emotion that pulled, you know, you towards this this book into this story. So, it seems like there must have maybe even, you know, subconsciously been anger around this experience that you perhaps needed to work through. Does that feel true?

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 是的。写了几稿之后，我真的不知道我为什么要写这本书，我不想分析，也不想弄明白。我只是想：“好吧，它通过我而来。太棒了。就顺其自然吧。”然后写了几稿之后，我回头看了一遍，你知道，我用红笔和荧光笔仔细审视，然后意识到：“哦，天哪，我对过去的一些情况有这么多未处理的愤怒。我想那就是让这本书得以产生的情感动力。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: Yes. Several drafts in, I literally did not know why I was writing this book and I didn't want to analyze. I didn't want to figure it out. I just thought, "Okay, this is coming through me. Great. Let's just go with it." And then a few drafts in, I looked back over it and, you know, I was looking over it with a red pen and a highlighter and realizing, "Oh my god, I have so much unprocessed anger about situations from my past. I think that is the emotional charge that is making this book happen."

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 噢。意识到这一点感觉如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Huh. How did it feel to realize that?

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 令人震惊，我想，因为，你知道，我在治疗中做了很多工作。我在个人成长方面做了很多工作，我真的非常重视个人成长，这不是我一直在思考的事情，这段关系已经是很久以前的事了，我没有思考它。我没有以任何方式感到它的负担。我没有想，你知道，我真的没有思考它。所以，很明显还有那么多需要处理的东西需要释放出来，这让我感到震惊。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: jarring I guess because, you know, I've I've done so much work in therapy. I've done so much you know personal work on myself and I really really value personal growth and it's something that I it's not like I'm thinking about this relationship is so far in the past I'm not thinking about it. I don't feel burdened by it in any way. I'm not thinking like, you know, I'm it's really not something that I think about. And so the fact that there was clearly so much left to process that needed to come out about it was shocking.

### 年龄差恋情与原生家庭影响

**Anna Martin**: 无论你觉得分享多少是舒服的，你能告诉我你大约18岁时发生的那段关系吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: However much again you feel comfortable sharing. Can you tell me about that relationship that happened when you were around 18?

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 是的，我当时18岁，他30多岁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: Yeah, I was 18. He was in his mid30s.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 我当时比**沃尔多**天真得多。沃尔多比我大胆得多。她也比我敏锐得多，而且……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: And I was a very I was so much more naive than Waldo. Waldo is so much bolder than I was. She's so much more perceptive and um

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 而且性经验丰富。那是很重要的一部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: and sexually experienced. That's a big part of the

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 完全正确。而且性经验丰富。嗯，我很有洞察力，但我会压抑自己的直觉，根本不去处理它们。**沃尔多**总是清楚地知道自己对一切事物的想法和感受。嗯，我尊重她这一点，但我当时非常压抑。我是在**摩门教**家庭长大的。尽管那时我的家人已经好几年没去教堂了，但我内心仍然深深植根着那种摩门教的价值观。所以，性是坏事，在结婚前我不会做。甚至性欲也被视为变态。我当时完全没有与男性的经验。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: Exactly. and sexually experienced. Um I was perceptive, but I would kind of shove down my instincts and not address them at all. Waldo's glaringly aware of how she thinks and feels about everything at all times. Um, I respect her for it, but I was very suppressed. I grew up **Mormon**. And though my family hadn't really been to church, you know, in a in a few years at that point, I still really had that kind of Mormon value system embedded in me. And so sex was bad and not something I was going to do until marriage. And even sexuality was sort of perverse and viewed as perverse. And and I I had literally no experience with men at all.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 甚至连吻都没有？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Well, like not even a kiss.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 让我想想。我吻过一次。我在**田纳西州纳什维尔的汉普顿套房酒店**吻过一次。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: Let's see. I had had one kiss. I'd had one kiss in a **Hampton Inn in Suites in Nashville, Tennessee**.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 大声说出来。

**Anna Martin**: Shout out.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 那很火热。好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: It was hot. Okay.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 所以你吻过，但仅此而已。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: So, you had a kiss, but nothing.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 吻过。完全正确。仅此而已。从未约会过。什么都没有。然后这件事发生了。这段关系，与这个人，最初他有女朋友。他和他女朋友住在一起。

**Janette McCertie**: Had a kiss. Exactly. Nothing beyond that. Had never been on a date. Like nothing. And then this happened. this relationship with this this person and and initially he was he had a girlfriend. He he lived with his girlfriend.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 哇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Whoa.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 是的。有几个月，他跟她在一起，而我们基本上也在一起。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: Yeah. And there were a few months where he was with her and and we were essentially together, you know, and

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 是的。我能问你吗？回到18岁时的你，他身上什么吸引了你？你和他在一起时感觉如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Yeah. C. Can I ask you like putting yourself back 18-year-old you, like what intrigued you about him? How did you feel when you were with him?

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 他对我来说很真实。你知道，在好莱坞长大，那个世界有它特定的运作方式。我从来没有真正理解过它的规则。感觉好莱坞有一个秘密代码，所有人都被告知了。所有人都被拍了拍头，被告知了好莱坞的规则。而我坐在这里想：“一点点。”我当时想：“任何时候，任何人在说什么？为什么没有人能拥有自己的观点？拜托，看在上帝的份上，谁能拥有自己的观点？”反正，我爱好莱坞。它很棒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: He seemed real to me. You know, growing up in Hollywood, there is just a certain way that world operates. And it's really never been one that I feel like I've understood the rules of. It feels like there is a secret code to Hollywood that everyone was told. Everyone was just tapped on the head with the rules of Hollywood. And I'm sitting here going, "A little." And I'm going, "What is literally anybody saying at any given time? Why can nobody own an opinion? Like, can we please somebody, for the love of God, own their opinions? Anyway, I love Hollywood. It's great.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 说出来。听起来会有有趣的派对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Say it. Sound like there'd be fun parties.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 嗯，是的。然后，你知道，我遇到了这个人，他看起来很真实，而且看起来……

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: It's um Yeah. And and and I then I you know, I met this person who just seemed real and seemed

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 他们也是吗？我听过另一次，你在工作中遇到他们，所以他们仍然是那个世界的一部分，但他们感觉……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: and were they I've heard another You met them at work, so they were still part of the world, but yeah, they felt

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 与那个世界不同。是的。他们对我来说不像是好莱坞的人。嗯，他们说话似乎没有那种代码。这不是眨眼和开枪，但好莱坞确实有点像眨眼和开枪。嗯，人们总是对你说话，但他就是感觉不同，他看起来很脆弱。他对自己和自己的生活看起来很诚实。我被他吸引了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: different from the world. Yeah. They didn't feel Hollywood to me. Um they didn't seem like they spoke in that kind of code. It's it's not a wink and a gun, but Hollywood really does kind of feel like a wink and a gun. Um, as people are just talking at you all the time, but he he just felt different and he seemed vulnerable. He seemed honest about, you know, himself and and and his life. I I was attracted to him.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 而且你对他有身体上的吸引力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: And you were physically attracted to him.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 是的。不过，你知道，我想这里有一些重叠，因为当**沃尔多**第一次见到**柯基先生**时，她真的很惊讶自己竟然会被一个不符合传统审美的人吸引。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: Yes. Although, you know, I suppose there is some overlap here cuz when when Maldo first meets **Mr. Corgi**, she's really shocked that she is attracted to someone who is not conventionally attractive.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Yes.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 在她生命中的这一点上，她只被有吸引力的人吸引过。是的。她指出，她会说，你知道，我可能会糟蹋你美丽的词句，但比如他脸上的毛孔，还有这些东西。她同时承认这些，又说，我想要他那皱巴巴的睾丸。我的意思是，那是你在书中提到的，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Up to this point in her life, she's only been attracted to people who are attractive. Yes. She calls out that she's like, you know, the what's it? I'm going to butcher your beautiful words, but like the pores on his face and the punch and the these types of things. She like acknowledges these at the same time as being like, I want his wrinkly balls. I mean, that's something that you mention in the book, right?

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 是的。她被他吸引，但真的不知道为什么，因为以前从未发生过这种事。嗯，你知道，我的经历中确实有一些重叠，我并没有觉得这个人特别有身体吸引力，但我却对他感到非常吸引。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: Yes. she's drawn to him and doesn't really doesn't know why because this has never happened before. And um you know that there there was certainly some overlap in my experience where this is not somebody who I I found you know particularly physically attractive and yet I felt very attracted to him.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 这是你第一次感受到那种强烈的身体吸引力吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Was this the kind of first time you'd felt that intense physical attraction?

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 100%。100%。那是一种渴望，一种我必须和这个人在一起的吸引力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: 100%. 100%. It was this hungry kind of I have to be with this person attraction.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 是的，我懂。我的意思是，我感受过，我也记得第一次。我们谈过他吸引你的地方，但他和你在一起时让你感觉如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Yeah, I know it. I mean, I felt it and I can also remember that first time. How did we talked about what drew you to him, but how did he make you feel when you were with him?

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 以一种别人无法真正理解的方式被看见。我想，我想大多数人只是把我当成一个乖乖女**摩门教徒**。我说话的方式都不一样。就像，嗯，是的，先生。那样令人讨厌，令人作呕。我想其他人把那些行为当作表面价值，并相信我就是那样的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: Seen in a way that others really couldn't. I think I think most other people were sort of taking my I mean, it was like a goody two shoes Mormon. I like I spoke in a different voice. It's like Mhm. Yes, sir. Like so annoying, obnoxious. And I think other people took those behaviors at face value and believed that I was that.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 而他身上有某种东西，就像，“到底发生了什么？那下面是什么？我知道你比你假装的更聪明。我知道你看到的比你假装的更多。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: And there was something in him that was like, what's really going on? Like what's underneath that? I know I know you're smarter than you're pretending to be. I know you're seeing more than you're pretending to.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 到底在发生什么？所以从这个角度看，这对我来说是一个机会，让我比以前通过别人更多地了解自己。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: What's kicking around? And so in that way, there was sort of an opportunity for me to learn more about myself than I had before through others.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 那对你来说，一个更真实的你被别人看到，一定是一种很大的肯定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: That must have been really validating for the for a realer version of you to be seen by someone.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 是的，就是这样。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: Yeah, it was. Yeah.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 是的。当然，我现在对那件事有复杂的感情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: Yeah. Of course, I have complicated feelings about that now.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 当然，我们稍后会谈到这些，但我想，存在于你18岁的大脑空间里很有趣，对吧？我的意思是，我们谈过这有多重要，再说一次，你不是**沃尔多**。沃尔多不是你。划清界限很重要。你知道，我们花了很多时间在沃尔多的大脑里。这很有启发性。现在你让我们进入你真实的经历，进入你的大脑，感觉就像，我被看见了。别人没有这样看待我。这个人感觉很真实。这个人感觉很不同。你提到，最初一段时间，当你们在一起时，这个男人有伴侣。所以，那是一个秘密吗？这只是你们两个之间的事吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Of course, when we will get to those, but in the I think it's interesting to sort of exist because in the space of of your 18-year-old brain, right? I mean, we talked about how important it is again, you are not Waldo. Waldo is not you. It's like important to make that distinction. You know, we spend so much time in Waldo's brain. It's illuminating. And now you're letting us into like what was actually your exper being in your brain being like, I'm I'm being seen. Other people don't see me in this way. This person feels real. This person feels different. For the first, you said bit of time while you were seeing each other. This man was in a relationship. So, was it a It was more of a secret. This was just between you two.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 是的，那是一个秘密。那是一个秘密，也是一个巨大的压力源。我想，你知道，现在回想起来，代际创伤和我的成长经历之间有着不可否认的联系，以及我当初为什么会被那种情况吸引。现在，当然，这看起来完全是疯了，会想，等等，这个人有一个同居的女朋友，就像，红旗遍地。但在当时，我的身体对这种关系带来的压力感到熟悉，并且在这种压力中找到了一种奇怪的舒适感。这听起来可能很恶心，可能令人困惑，但我认为任何在功能失调家庭中长大的人都完全明白我在说什么。我是在父母不断尖叫和争吵的混乱环境中长大的。所以我的身体，我想，期望并接受那种混乱作为常态，作为家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: Yes, it was a secret. And it was a thing that it was a secret and it was a massive stressor. And I think, you know, back on that now and the undeniable link between generational trauma and my experience in my upbringing and why I was attracted to that kind of a situation in the first place. Now, of course, it seems utterly insane to be like, wait, this person has a girlfriend that he lives with and like it just red flags on red flags on red flags on red flags. But at the time there was something that my body was familiar with in the stress that this relationship provided me and a strange comfort in that stress. This may sound gross. This may sound confusing, but I think anyone who grew up in a dysfunctional family knows exactly what I'm talking about. I grew up with, you know, parents screaming and and fighting and constantly and it was really chaotic. And so my body I think expected and accepted that kind of chaos as normaly as home.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 我的意思是，你们两人之间的亲密动态，性动态。你提到在这段关系之前你没有任何经验。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: I mean the intimate dynamic the sexual dynamic between the two of you. You mentioned that you were not experienced before this relationship.

**Anna Martin**: I'm trying to like think about like interest. Okay. Um and and what was it like to discover that's not a question I've ever asked on the show before. What was it like to discover what come was? But that is the question.

**Janette McCertie**: It was nasty.

**Anna Martin**: 而且这就像，嗯，我该怎么问呢？就像，因为在对话的早些时候，你谈到性对你来说如何成为关系中非常重要的一部分，或者说情感需求的容器。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: And and this is like a hm how do I ask this? It's like cuz cuz earlier on in the conversation you were talking about how you know sex for you became a really important part of relationships or like a container for emotional needs.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 以及我如何感受到价值。坦白说，我根本没有真正看到或理解我在其他领域的价值。是的，我真的相信我的价值来自性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: and how I felt value. Frankly, I didn't really see or understand my value in other areas at all. I yeah I I really believed that my value came from sex.

**Anna Martin**: 而这，这是什么？因为这是你的第一次性关系，对吗？所以这些神经通路就是这样连接起来的，如果可以这么说的话。性是如何影响这段关系的，以及它如何教导你这决定了你的价值？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: And this what was it this because this was your first sexual relationship, right? So it's where these sort of neural pathways were being connected if it were like how did sex factor into this relationship and how did it sort of teach you this is determinant of my worth?

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 嗯，我先跟你分享“射精”的故事，因为那只是冰山一角。对。

<details>

**Janette McCertie**: 他当时有女朋友。这可能是在八月左右开始的，然后到了十月、十一月，对我来说真的太难了，所以我当时说，我，我不想再这样下去了。然后当然，当你说了那句话的时候，他就会说，好吧，我要离开她。我要离开她。

And then there was this big kind of grand plan where he was going to go out of town to visit family for Christmas.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 他回来后会和她分手。所以他会去和女朋友分手，然后我应该去接他，对吧？所以我们要去我的公寓，但那时我妈妈病了。所以她带着我爸爸、我奶奶、我爷爷、我三个兄弟来到我的公寓。所以就像是一个庞大的**摩门教**呆板家庭在我的公寓里，而我却想把我的30多岁的男朋友带回家，对吧？所以我就想：“好吧。”

**Janette McCertie**: Worst case scenario. Exactly. So, then I I'm like, "Okay, I can I can problem solve here. I know what I'll do. I'll get us a room at the **Sherin Universal**."

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 不是你第一次接吻的**汉普顿酒店**，应该回去那里。他们对我很好。那些热乎乎的饼干很棒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Not the Hampton Inn where you had your first should have gone back. They've treated me well. Those warm cookies are great.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 所以，我在**环球喜来登酒店**订了一晚。我去接他。他喝得烂醉，而我当时滴酒未沾。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: So, I got a I got a a night stay at the **Sheran Universal**. I picked him up. He was drunk off his ass, which I had never had a sip of alcohol at this point. O

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 或者，嗯，是的，也许我那时喝过一口。我不知道具体时间，但我那时肯定没喝过一杯酒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: or um yeah, maybe I had had one sip at this point. I don't know the timeline, but I certainly had never had like a glass of alcohol at this point.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 所以，我不知道他完全醉了。现在我明白了，哦，他醉得一塌糊涂。我当时不知道他是否只喝了一杯，或者一个人醉了就是这个样子。他跌跌撞撞地走着。衬衫上全是啤酒渍。一团糟。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: And so, I didn't know that he was completely drunk. Like, now I get, oh, he was way way way drunk. I was I don't know if he'd had one drink and this is just what a person looked like. He's like stumbling around. There's beer stains all on his shirt. Just a mess.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 我在酒店大堂已经有点尴尬了，对吧？因为他只是跌跌撞撞地走着。他撞到电梯门上。我们到了房间。他甚至都，我记得他刷不了房卡。他弄不好。所以我拿过房卡。我们进去后，他开始抽泣，想知道自己是否做出了正确的选择，认为自己犯了个错误。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: And I'm like a little embarrassed already in the lobby, right? Cuz he's just stumbling around. He's like banging up against the elevator door. We get up to our room. He can't even I remember he couldn't swipe the key card on. He couldn't get it to work. So I take the key card. We go inside and then he's sobbing and wondering if he made the right choice, thinking he made a mistake.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 他分手了。他刚刚分手。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: He broke up. He just he just broke up.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 他刚从分手现场过来。所以他正处于那种情绪的漩涡中，非常情绪化，然后要求我为他做一些事，因为在那之前我一直说：“我结婚前不做爱。我不会那样做。我，我的意思是，我甚至都不知道。我不会知道怎么做。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: Literally just left this breakup. So, he's in the throws of that and and really emotional and then asks me to give him a [ __ ] because up to this point I have said, "I don't do sex till marriage. I'm not going to do that. I don't I mean, I didn't even really know. I wouldn't have known how to do it." Um,

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 所以在那之前一直只是亲吻。然后他说：“你知道，我需要知道你愿意做些什么。我不做爱没关系，但我需要知道你会做些什么，因为我需要，我需要我的，我必须满足我的需求。”他当时是这么说的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: and so it had just been sort of kissing up to that point. And then he says, "You know, I I need to know that you're comfortable doing something. I'm okay not having sex, but I need to know that you you'll do something because I need I need my I have to have my needs met." he had said.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 哇，这真是很有趣的措辞。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Wow, that is really interesting language.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 这措辞是不是很有趣？嗯，然后我感到一阵焦虑，全身火烧般的焦虑，只是想着，好吧，我必须弄清楚如何做这件我不知道怎么做的事情。所以我当时就像在问他……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: Isn't that interesting language? Um, and so I felt a flood of anxiety, like full body fire anxiety, and just thinking, okay, I have to figure out how to do this thing that I don't know how to do. So I was like asking him

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 否则我就会失去，否则。我的意思是，那就是那种状态。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: or else I'll lose or else. I mean, that's the state.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 完全正确。完全正确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: Exactly. Exactly.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 所以，一开始我拒绝了。我拒绝了几次，然后他说：“好吧，我要走了。”你知道，就是那种情况，那非常符合我们整体上不健康的关系动态。但是，嗯，当然我也包括在内。我不是只把责任推给他。但他开始告诉我怎么做。所以我正在为他做那件事。然后，你知道，他说他要“射精”了。我不知道那是什么意思。我想，射到哪里？你在说什么？你是坐起来吗？你知道，我不知道那是什么意思。然后它就射到我嘴里了，嗯，我说，有些东西出来了。有些东西出来了，我跑到水槽边，我以为他尿在我嘴里了。就像，一开始我以为，哦，天哪，他尿在我嘴里了，但后来我又想，这不像，我的意思是，我从未尝过尿，但这不像我以为尿的味道。嗯，那真是太多的困惑，太多的身体不适。嗯，现在看来，那真是太多的喜剧素材了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: So then, and at first I said no. I'd said no, you know, a couple times and then it was okay, I'm leaving, you know, that kind of thing, which was very much our our dynamic. um as a whole was just so unhealthy. But um of course I'm included in that. I'm not just putting that on him. But then he he starts telling me kind of how to do it. And so I'm giving him the [ __ ] And then you know he says I'm going to come. I don't know what that means. I figure like come where? What are you talking like? Are you sitting up? Like that you know I didn't know what that meant. And then it came in my mouth and um I said something came out. something came out and I like ran to the sink and I was I thought he peed in my mouth like like first I was like oh my god he peed in my mouth but then I'm like this doesn't I mean I've never tasted pee but it doesn't taste like what I think pee would taste like. Um and it was just so much confusion so much body discomfort. Um, and so much comedy gold now.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 我想说的是，我之所以发出这种有点悲伤的笑声，是因为，就像，这本书有些部分很有趣。就像这里有幽默。这里有那种“这是什么鬼东西？”的幽默。你知道，但你后来又跳出来，你理解并看到了这种情况发生的背景，以及其中运作的权力动态。所以，它就是这样，它就像幽默与这另一件事并存。我的意思是，这件事发生之后，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: I was going to say I mean I'm making these sort of like sad laughter because like there are parts of this just as there are parts of this book that are funny. Like there is humor here. There is humor and being like what the heck is this? you know, but but then you sort of zoom out and you understand you see the context in which you know this is happening and the power dynamics that are operating here. And so it is it doesn't it's like humor alongside of this other thing. I mean after this happened

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 嗯……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: um

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 你还记得你当时的感觉吗？你是不是觉得“我做到了，我抓住他了，我留住他了”？你当时的感觉是什么，如果你还记得的话？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: do you remember how you felt where you're like I did it like he's I've got him like I'm keeping him. What what was the what was your feeling if you can remember?

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 不，我想我感到非常不安和不确定。我没有觉得自己做得很好。就像，你知道，我从小就是一个取悦他人的人，我总是根据自己满足他人需求和欲望的表现来评价自己。所以，你知道，我在这件事上做得怎么样？哦，我觉得我做得不好，你知道，所以那时我就感到压力，觉得我没有做得很好。嗯，我后来进步了，别担心。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: No, I think I felt very shaky and uncertain and I don't I didn't think I had done a good job. Like I, you know, growing up as that people pleaser, I was really always rating myself in the performance of how much I was accommodating somebody else's needs and desires. So, it was, you know, how did I do on that [ __ ] Oh, I don't think I did well, you know, and so then it was just stress of thinking I I hadn't really done well. Um, and I got better, don't worry. Um,

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 我当时吓坏了，你知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: I was freaking out, you know.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 不，你别担心。但是，你知道，我很高兴你提到了幽默这一点，因为我认为，你知道，我认为这是所有这一切的重要组成部分。我认为在黑暗的题材中有很多幽默和轻松，假装没有实际上是在否认它的真相。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: No, you worry. Um, but you know, I I am I'm glad you you bring up this humor thing, too, because I think, you know, I I think it's an important piece of of all of this. I think there's so much humor and levity in dark subject matter, and to pretend there isn't is actually denying the truth of it,

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 我认为有一种方式，幽默可以使事情变得轻浮或削弱主题。我不喜欢那样。我不认为那样。我认为那是一种回避和防御机制。我通常不喜欢阅读或观看那些东西。它们就是无法引起我的共鸣。但我确实认为幽默和悲剧之间存在一种元素。它可以非常真诚，非常有价值。我认为否则事情可能会变得过于戏剧化，并且以那种方式显得不真诚。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: and I think there's a way of of there's a way where humor can make something flippant or undermine the subject matter. And I don't like that. I I don't think that. I think that's kind of deflective and a defense mechanism. And I I generally don't enjoy reading those things, watching those things. They just don't resonate with me. But I do think there is an element of of humor and tragedy. It can be really honest and really um valuable. I think otherwise something can just be too kind of melodramatic and and insincere in that way.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 噢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Huh.

</details>

### 幽默与悲剧的并存

**Anna Martin**: 你生命中的这段时间，这段关系中，还有没有其他让你带着一些幽默感去回想的时刻？还有没有其他让你想到的时刻？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Is there another moment from this time in your life, from this relationship that has that kind of that you think about with some amount of humor? Is there another moment that comes to mind?

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 我的意思是，那时我生活中发生的每一个元素。天哪。是的。我18岁，在**Nickelodeon**的节目中，和一个30多岁的人谈恋爱，而我妈妈正在去世。这种并置，那个世界的高潮和低谷，常常非常有趣。你知道，当时很难，但几乎在任何房间、任何时间，肯定都有幽默感。也许那时我无法看到，但我想现在，我想在我20多岁中期偏后的时候，它发生了转变，我可以在实时中更多地看到幽默。它不需要，你知道，10年的视角或其他什么来发现当下发生的事情中的幽默。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: I mean, literally every element of my life that was happening at that at that point. Um Jeez. Yeah. I was 18 on a on a **Nickelodeon** show in a relationship with a 30-year-old person while my mom was dying. And this sort of juxtaposition, the highs and lows of that world were were oftentimes really funny. You know, it was it was hard at the time, but there was certainly humor in almost any given room at any given time. And maybe I wasn't able to see it then, but I think nowadays, I think somewhere in my, you know, maybe mid late 20s, it shifted mid20s where I could kind of see the humor a little bit more in real time. It didn't take, you know, 10 years of perspective or whatever to find the humor in something happening currently.

</details>

### 结束关系与自我赋能

**Anna Martin**: 这种关系的结局。说到你当时的那段关系，你能描述一下你是如何离开它的吗？事情是如何结束或停止的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: The sort of ending. Speaking of this relationship that you were in, can you describe how how you left it? How things how things ended or stopped?

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 我甩了他。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: I left his ass.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Yeah.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 好的。太棒了。好的。我的意思是，你愿意分享多少就分享多少，我很想听听。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Okay. Hell yeah. Okay. I mean, as much as you want to share about that, I would be curious to hear.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 我那时还在演戏。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: I was still acting at the time.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 我要去**加拿大**拍戏，我想是**多伦多**。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: and I was going away on a shoot to **Canada**, I want to say, um, **Toronto**. Yeah.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 我当时在努力回想我是在纽约拍戏还是在多伦多拍不同的东西，但我想是多伦多的那次。我当时就有一种感觉，生活就在我面前。我其实之前和他分手过一次，你知道，他和我分手过几次，我也和他分手过几次，又是那种情况。但是，嗯，但是在我妈妈快去世的时候，我曾和他分手。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: I was trying to remember if I was doing a shoot in New York or if it was a different thing in Toronto, but I think it was the Toronto one. And I just had this feeling of of life is in front of me. I had actually broken up with him once before, you know, and there had been multiple he had broken up with me. I had broken up with it was again that kind of a thing. But um but I had broken up with him as my mom was dying.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 天哪，珍妮特。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Jeez, Janette.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 这有点发生在多伦多事件之前，但在我妈妈快去世的时候，因为我当时的想法是这样的：我会因为依赖他、期望他支持我、和他一起经历这段经历而与他产生过多的羁绊。这会让我与他产生过多的羁绊，以至于我不知道以后能否摆脱。我不知道我能否做到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: This was kind of before this Toronto situation, but as my mom was dying because I felt like my my thinking was this. I will bond with him too much by like leaning on him and expecting the support from him and going through this experience with him. That's going to bond me too much that I don't know if I'll get out later. I don't know if I'll be able to.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 你会在你妈妈去世的这段时间和他产生羁绊，你可能无法自拔。所以，最好现在就离开。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: You will bond with him during this time when your mom was dying and you might not be able to extricate yourself. So, better to get out now.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 我觉得我可能会被困住。我可能会被困住。我真的不喜欢以任何方式感到被困住或被束缚。我喜欢感到自由。你们俩总共在一起多久了，包括分分合合？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: I felt like I may be stuck. I may be trapped. that and that's a I really don't like to feel stuck or trapped in anyway. I like to feel free. How long were you two seeing each other all told with the ups and downs?

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 大概两年多一点，中间有几次短暂的分手。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: It would have been like maybe a little over 2 years with a couple like short breakups in between.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 在接下来的几年里，在那些关系中。我的意思是，你还有其他关系。你会想起这个人吗？会有什么线索让你想起他吗？不。完全没有。噢。你在摇头。是的。完全没有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: in the relationships in the years that followed. I mean, you had other relationships. Would you would you think about this guy? Would like something clue you? No. Not at all. Huh. You're shaking your head. Yeah. Not at all.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 不。我真的，我想当我决定放下一些事情时，我就是准备好放下了。我尝试了一切。我用尽了所有选择。我对我的决定充满信心，这适用于我能想到的所有关系和其他方面，一旦我放下了，我就不会回头。我已经在这上面浪费了足够的时间了。我很好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: No. I literally it was truly I think by the time I move on from things I am ready to move on. I have tried everything. I have exhausted all options. I am confident in my decision and that goes for literally I mean I can think of so many relational and otherwise that once I move on I'm going I'm not looking back. There's I've wasted enough time on this already. I'm good.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 噢。但后来这种愤怒又重新浮现了。你认为它为什么现在重新浮现了？是什么原因？或者不是现在，而是在写这本书的时候。为什么？是什么让它重新浮现？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Huh. But then this anger resurfaced. Why do you think it resurfaced now? Like what was it? Or not now in the moment of writing this book. Why? What brought it back up?

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 我思考过这个问题。我探索过这个问题。我认为原因在于，在我们30多岁的时候，我们女性终于有了这样的空间，以一种更富有同情心和理解的方式，重新审视我们与过去自我的关系。我说话的时候甚至有点起鸡皮疙瘩，这一定是真的，感觉就像，哦，我可以用比以前更多的同情心和理解来审视自己。你知道，我们的20多岁通常是模糊的，我们只是充满抱负，努力寻找自己的方向，那是一团糟，关系就是混乱，是有趣的混乱，是凌乱的混乱，是丑陋的混乱。但到了30岁，我们可能已经开始稳定下来，找到自己的立足点，安顿下来。有了反思的空间，这可能是在我们20多岁时没有的。我认为这确实以一种我们以前无法接触的方式，打开了我们与过去自我的关系。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: I've thought about that. I've explored that. I think what it is is that in our 30s, we as women, we finally have this space to reframe our relationship with our past self in a way to meet her with more I'm actually getting a little goosebumps as I'm saying this must be true where it feels like, oh, I can see myself with more compassion than I had for myself before and more understanding. And you know, our 20s are such a blur typically and we're just it's ambition and we're trying to find our way and it's a mess and relationship is just it's it's chaos and it's fun chaos and it's me messy chaos and it's ugly chaos. But then by, you know, by 30 we've kind of started to maybe land somewhere, find our footing, settle in. There's space to reflect in a way that maybe we didn't in our 20s. And I think it really opens up our relationship to our past self in a way that we didn't have access for previously.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 哦，天哪。从一个30多岁的女人到另一个，我心想：“是的，太对了。”但我认为你说的非常准确，至少与我的经历相符。这是我生命中第一次，在这个年纪，我觉得我有那个空间去反思、去处理、去回顾事情，你知道，而且似乎当你回顾这段关系时，愤怒是重新浮现的情绪。我想知道，在写这本书的过程中，你是否以不同的方式看待那段关系？你是否以一种新的方式看待它？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Oh my gosh. From one 30 something woman to I'm like, "Yes, it's it's so true." But I think what you're saying is is very spot-on, at least with my experience. This is the first time in my life, this age where I feel like I have that space, to reflect, to process, to look back at things, you know, and and and it seems like when you looked back at this relationship, anger was something that resurfaced. I guess I wonder like in writing this book, do you look back on that relationship differently? Like is that do do you see it in a new way?

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 是的，我想，我想那是写作的众多超能力之一，你知道，它确实能在没有解决的地方带来解决。我想我，我当时甚至没有意识到我对这件事没有解决，但我想我感受到了。而且，嗯，我想通过释放愤怒，让它，你知道，引导，可以获得一种柔软。现在有一种柔软，我敢说，也许是一种欣赏。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: Yeah, I think I think that's one of the many I think superpowers of writing is it, you know, it does lead to closure where there wasn't closure. And I think I I felt I I didn't even realize that I didn't have closure about this thing, but I think I felt that. And there's um I think there's a softness that's accessible through I think letting the rage out, letting it letting it, you know, lead. There's now kind of um a softness and dare I say, you know, an appreciation maybe.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 哇。对那段经历。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Wow. For that experience. Yeah.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 对那段经历。它当然非常复杂，而且，嗯，我有很多遗憾，它绝不干净。但我想，你知道，我既可以一直对它生气并抓住不放，也可以说，你知道吗，我已经放下了。我从中吸取了教训。它塑造了今天的我，以及我所做的选择，我如何从中获取价值。我想回到力量这个话题，那是一种寻找力量的方式，因为也许我当时真的没有感受到任何力量。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: For that experience. It's of course very complicated and um I have a lot of regret and it's not clean in any way. But I think you know I can either stay mad at it and hold on to that or I can say you know what I've moved on from it. I've learned from it. It's informed who I am today and the choices I've made and how can I take value from it. And I think circling back to power, that's a way of of finding power because maybe I I didn't really feel any at the time.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 我们说的这种愤怒。你对谁生气？他，你自己，还是这个世界？这种愤怒是针对什么的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: This anger we're speaking of. Who were you angry at? Him, yourself, the world? Like what what was that anger directed towards?

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 他和我自己。然后我想是我的处境，假设这些处境的某种版本可能，你知道，把我引向那条路，或者促使我走上那条路。嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: Him and myself. And then I think my circumstances, assuming that some version of those circumstances maybe, you know, led me down that path or contributed to me landing on that path. Hm.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 意思是，你知道，例如，在**摩门教**家庭长大，不断受到严格的指导和规则，你知道，在儿童电视节目中工作，总是觉得自己应该成为某一种样子。那就像一个压力锅。就像一个摇晃过的汽水罐。它总会在某个时候爆发。还有什么比这更好的爆发方式呢？一个取悦他人、**摩门教**徒、童星、妈妈的小天使，还有什么比这更好的爆发方式呢？那就是说：“猜猜怎么着？我的第一段恋情将是和一个30多岁的男人。大家看着吧。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Meaning like, you know, for example, growing up Mormon and having such such strict guidelines and rules constantly in regulations and, you know, being on kids TV and just feeling like I was supposed to be this one thing all the time. It's like a pressure cooker. It's like it's like a shaken soda can. It's like it's going to burst at some point. And what better way to burst? What better way for a people pleaser, Mormon, child actor, mommy's angel to burst than going, "Guess what? My first relationship is gonna be with a 30-some year old man. Take that everybody. Like

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 麦克风掉落。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: mic drop.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 噢。是的。是的。我的意思是，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: Huh. Yes. Yes. I mean,

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 我当时没有那么想。我当然没有想：“哦，我要这样做来报复别人。”但是，你知道，事后看来，我确实看到了这方面的元素。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: I wasn't thinking that. I of course wasn't like, "Oh, I'm going to do this to get back at people." But, you know, in in in hindsight, I I do see elements of that for sure.

</details>

### 愤怒的力量与行动

**Anna Martin**: 愤怒的另一面是什么？当你把它驱逐出去后，剩下的是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: What's on the other side of anger? Like, once you expel it, what's there? What's left?

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 嗯，我甚至不想驱逐它。我爱愤怒。我非常感谢愤怒。我认为它引导我做出了生命中每一个强大而正确的决定。嗯，愤怒让我克服了饮食失调。愤怒让我进入了正确的恋爱关系，就是我现在这段已经持续了9年的关系。你知道，愤怒让我辞去了演艺工作，说不再演了。愤怒让我得到了生命中所有美好的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: Well, I I don't even want to expel it. Like I love anger. I'm so grateful for anger. I think it's led me to make every strong good decision in my life that I've made. Um anger is what got me to get over an eating disorder. Anger is what got me to get into the right relationship, which is the one that I'm in now that I've been in for 9 years. You know, anger is what got me to quit acting and say no more. Anger is what's gotten me anything good in my life.

</details>

**Anna Martin**: 哇。我的意思是，这听起来有悖常理。我感觉我情感上理解，但请帮助我更多地理解。当你说愤怒让你进入了这段美好的关系时，愤怒是如何把你带到那里的？你指的是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Martin**: Wow. I mean, it it sounds counterintuitive. I feel like I emotionally understand, but but help me understand more. When you say like anger got me into this wonderful relationship, how did anger get you there? What do you mean by that?

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 因为我厌倦了以前的关系，厌倦了我在以前关系中的行为方式，厌倦了对方的行为方式，厌倦了那种动态。嗯，我只是想，你知道，我必须努力。我会看自助书籍，我会看治疗师的YouTube视频和约会建议，我只是想，我一定要弄明白。我太生气了。我一定要弄明白如何正确地、更好地去做。我将治愈我需要治愈的部分，这样我就不会重蹈覆辙。这很辛苦，但愤怒是如此具有驱动力，以至于它能让你完成任何程度的工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janette McCertie**: Because I was so sick of previous relationships and how I behaved in previous relationships, how the other person behaved, what the dynamic was. Um, and I just thought, you know, I've got to put in the work. And I would get, you know, self-help books and I would look at YouTube videos of therapists and dating advice and just I thought, I'm going to figure this out. I'm too mad. I'm going to figure out how to do it right and how to do it better. I'm going to heal my the parts that need healing so that I don't re re um create these patterns and it's it's hard work, but anger is so mobilizing that it can get you through I think any amount of of work.

</details>

**Janette McCertie**: 就像感谢上帝赐予愤怒。我想，你知道，悲伤对我来说真的会让我停滞不前，困在泥沼中，而焦虑会让我感到虚弱，哦，我因为太焦虑而无法做出决定。但天哪，愤怒会让我从椅子上站起来，做出一些决定，向前迈进，并努力工作。

**Janette McCertie**: I really would. I really would. You know, I mentioned earlier kind of an appreciation for the past and and I and I do feel that.
