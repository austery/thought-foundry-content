### CUSMA与中国电动汽车协议

**主持人**: 我们正处于一个破裂之中，而非转型。这是**马克·卡尼**上周在**瑞士达沃斯**世界经济论坛的一次演讲中说的。他呼吁像加拿大这样的中等强国建立新秩序，并举例说明加拿大如何应对这个日益不确定的全球格局。他谈到了新的联盟和新的伙伴关系，以及在国际上推行多元化的必要性。为了解决全球性问题，我们正在推行可变几何。换句话说，基于共同价值观和利益的不同联盟。那么，这一切将如何影响加拿大最重要的经济关系之一，即加拿大、美国、墨西哥协议，也就是**CUSMA**，该协议将于今年进行审查？我们将探讨它的生存机会，以及它在新世界秩序中的契合度或不契合度。然后，作为卡尼所谈到的多元化的一部分，加拿大和中国刚刚达成了一项协议，将降低多达 49,000 辆中国制造的电动汽车的关税。消费者会渴望驾驶它们吗？这是本期节目。

**Host**: We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition. That was Mark Carney last week during a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He went on to call on middle powers like Canada to build a new order and gave examples of how Canada is navigating this increasingly uncertain global landscape. He spoke of new alliances and new partnerships and the need to pursue diversification internationally. To help solve global problems, we're pursuing variable geometry. In other words, different coalitions for different issues based on common values and interests. So, where does this all leave one of Canada's most important economic relationships, the Canada, United States, Mexico agreement or KUSMA, which is up for review this year. We look at its chances of survival and how it fits or doesn't fit in this new world order. And then as part of that diversification Carney was talking about, Canada and China just struck a deal that'll see a reduced tariff on up to 49,000 Chinese-made electric vehicles. Will consumers be eager to get behind the wheel? This is the rundown.

</details>

**主持人**: 加拿大、美国、墨西哥协议已经生效近六年了，但自总统**唐纳德·特朗普**发动贸易战以来，两国关系至少可以说是跌宕起伏。就在最近，他警告说，如果加拿大与中国达成贸易协议，他将对加拿大征收 100% 的关税。而且他似乎不相信加拿大和墨西哥能提供多少。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: The Canada, United States, Mexico agreement has been in effect for almost six years now, but relations have been rocky to say the least since President Donald Trump started his trade war. Just recently, he warned he'd slap a 100% tariff on Canada if it made a trade deal with China. And he doesn't seem convinced that Canada and Mexico have much to offer.

</details>

**特朗普**: 你知道，我们不需要加拿大制造的汽车。我们不需要墨西哥制造的汽车。我们想在这里制造。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Trump**: You know, we don't need cars made in Canada. We don't need cars made in Mexico. We want to make him here.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么，他到底想不想保留 CUSMA？随着三国重返谈判桌审查协议，我们将在未来几个月内找出这个世界上最大的自由贸易区是否有未来。为了帮助大家理解，我采访了**加拿大全球事务研究所**的高级顾问兼研究员**科林·罗伯逊**。他曾参与 **NAFTA** 的实施团队；以及**卡尔加里大学**公共政策学院院长、前多伦多 Willowdale 自由党国会议员**玛莎·霍尔·芬利**。她们都是**卡尔顿大学**加拿大-美国关系专家组成员。科林，玛莎，很高兴你们来到节目。你们怎么样？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So, does he want to keep Kuzzma or not? With the three countries heading back to the table to review it, we're going to find out in the coming months whether the largest free trade region in the world has a future. To help break this down, I spoke with Colin Robertson, senior adviser and fellow at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute. He also served on the NAFTA implementation team and Martha Hall Finley, director of the school of public policy at the University of Calgary and former Liberal MP for the writing of Toronto Willowdale. They are both members of Carlton University's expert group on Canada US relations.

Colin Martha, great to have you on the show. How are you both doing?

</details>

**科林·罗伯逊**: 哦，很好。很高兴今天和您在一起。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Colin Robertson**: Oh, great. Good to be with you today.

</details>

**玛莎·霍尔·芬利**: 谢谢。很高兴来到这里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Martha Hall Finley**: Thank you. And it's great to be here.

</details>

**主持人**: 太棒了。我们开始吧。众所周知，即将举行的 CUSMA 联合审查是关于协议的变更以及可能将其延长至 202X 年的谈判。科林，如果加拿大怀疑美国可能在恶意谈判，它将如何应对这些谈判？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Awesome. Well, let's start off. As we know, the upcoming KUSMA joint review are talks about changes to the agreement and possibly extending it to 202. Colin, how does Canada approach these talks if it suspects that the US is negotiating perhaps in bad faith?

</details>

### CUSMA审查与贸易博弈

**科林·罗伯逊**: 嗯，你必须认真对待它们，即使我们认为他们在恶意谈判，因为这项协议占我们对全球出口的 75%，进口的约 60%。这是我们最重要的贸易关系，你知道我们正试图实现贸易多元化，但这仍然是我们最重要的市场，你无法改变地理位置，无论发生什么，它仍然是加拿大的一大市场。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Colin Robertson**: Well, you have to take them seriously even if we think they're negotiating in bad faith because this agreement accounts for 75% of our exports to the world and about 60% of our imports. It is our preponderant trading relationship and as you know we're trying to diversify trade but this is still the most important market for us and you can't change geography and whatever happens it's still going to be a major market for Canada.

</details>

**玛莎·霍尔·芬利**: 嗯，我有一个稍微不同的看法。我认为值得记住的是，这本来就不是一次重新谈判。这本来只是一个审查，以确定是否要进一步延长它。当然，这会打开讨论的机会，但唐纳德·特朗普一直把它当作不是法律来对待，而它就是我们两国的法律。所以，我们现在都接受这将是一次重新谈判的事实，感觉有点像我们落入了他们的圈套。而且，我认为这是唐纳德·特朗普上次说的“有史以来最好的协议”，对吧？所以，我认为在信任方面存在巨大的挑战。我不知道所谓的“重新谈判”能让我们得到多少可以依靠的东西。所以我们必须非常非常小心。我想，科林，你我可能都听过这句话。我们必须认真对待唐纳德·特朗普，但不能照字面意思理解他。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Martha Hall Finley**: um a slightly different perspective I think one I think it's worth remembering that this was not ever supposed to be a renegotiation. This was just supposed to be a review to determine whether to extend it even further than it otherwise would. Um, of course, you know, that would open the opportunity to have discussions, but Donald Trump has been treating this as if it isn't the law and it isn't the law of our two two countries, and it is. And so, the very fact that we're all now accepting that this is going to be renegotiation feels a little bit like we've fallen into their trap. Um, and I would argue this was the deal that Donald Trump the last time around said was the best deal ever, right? So I think there's a massive challenge in terms of trust. I don't know how much uh so-called renegotiation is going to get us anything that we can count on. So we have to just be really really careful. I think you know Colin you and I have both heard this. Um we must take Donald Trump seriously but we can't take him literally.

</details>

**科林·罗伯逊**: 嗯，但我和你可能有点不同的是，是的，这是与美国的关系，占我们出口的 75%，但你知道，在自由贸易协定签署之前，我们经济相当不错。我们与美国许多地方的人们都有着非常好的关系，如果你认识到这不仅仅是渥太华和华盛顿的事情。是的，这很重要。这对我们来说是一项非常重要的协议，但它不是世界末日。我认为我们必须非常清楚地认识到，加拿大不会因此而生或死。而且我认为，如果我们一直这么说，我们几乎会给特朗普更多……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Colin Robertson**: um but the other part of where I might differ a little bit is yeah it's the relationship with the United States 75% of our exports but you know we had a pretty decent economy before the free trade agreement was signed. We had a pretty good um uh we have great relationships with an awful lot of Americans in different parts of the country if you recog recognize that this isn't just an Ottawa DC thing. Um, yeah, it's important. It's a really important deal for us, but it's not the end of the world. And I think we have to be really conscious of the fact that Canada, you know, we're not we're not going to live or die um on this. And I think if we keep saying that, we're almost going to be giving Trump more

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，那样的话，会给他更多……如果你愿意的话，会给他更多余地。话虽如此，科林，我很好奇，你知道，如果这只是审查，而不是谈判，有些人可能会觉得是这样，并且好奇，你认为美国可能会 looking at 哪些改变或调整？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: well with that more leeway, if you will. With that being said, Colin, I am curious, you know, if these are just reviews and perhaps not negotiations, some people might feel that is the case and are curious, what are the changes or adjustments that uh you suspect the US might be looking at?

</details>

**科林·罗伯逊**: 哦，我认为美国人会来找我们。从他们举行的听证会以及美国贸易代表每年发布的“麻烦清单”来看，我们几乎都知道。所以，这是我们乳制品行业的供应管理。他们可能会攻击我们的银行服务。他们可能会攻击文化。他们可能想……他们肯定会攻击汽车贸易。他们已经开始了。请记住，我们已经就已施加的森林产品、钢铁、铝和汽车零部件关税进行了谈判。所以，我们知道他们的立场。而且我认为我同意玛莎的看法。我认为目前他们是在玩弄我们。但正如玛莎所说，我认为我们看到的，这都是一场游戏的一部分。而且我认为我们可以参考的最佳剧本是特朗普的《交易的艺术》。就是利用杠杆、恐吓、欺凌、骚扰，这就是我们看到的。所以，但就我们而言，因为这对我们太重要了，要保持冷静，继续前进，要有耐心，但要记住，这可能不会成功。因此，我们应该计划一个 B 计划。我认为总理已经提出了这方面的建议，即贸易多元化，在国内建设，特别是要做好国内工作。各省长今天正在开会。我认为他们需要解决国内贸易壁垒问题。这仍然是联邦制下未完成的业务，但我们仍然需要与美国达成某种安排，如果可能的话，但我们可能得不到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Colin Robertson**: Oh, I think the Americans are going to come at us. We we pretty much know from the hearings they've held and the United States trade representative comes publish a list every year of the irritants. So, it's our supply management for dairy products. It's uh they may go after our banking services. They may go after culture. Uh they may want to put they're certainly going to go after the auto trade. They've already begun this. Keep in mind, we're already engaged in negotiations as a result of tariffs already imposed on forest products, steel, aluminum, and auto parts. So, we know where they're coming from. And I think I would agree with Martha. I think for now they're playing us. But I think what we're seeing as Martha says, uh this is all part of a game. And I think the best playbook that we can look at is the art of the deal, Trump's art of the deal. It's it's to use leverage, intimidate, bully, harass, and that's what we're seeing. So, but we on our part because it is so important for us, keep calm, carry on, be patient, but keep in mind this may not work out. And so, we should be planning on a plan B. I think the prime minister's already put that forward in terms of trade diversification, building at home, and particularly doing it work at home. The premier are meeting today. I think they need to take on internal trade barriers. That's still unfinished business at Confederation, but we still have to have some kind of an arrangement with the United States if we can, but we may not get it.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，好吧，我们稍后会谈到各省长，但科林，我想先和你聊聊。你认为这个协议现在不会通过，是这样吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Uh, well, we'll get to the premers, but Colin, I do want to stick with you. You are you is it fair to say that you believe this deal won't go through

</details>

**科林·罗伯逊**: 现在？我很怀疑。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Colin Robertson**: right now? I'm doubtful.

</details>

**主持人**: 为什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Why?

</details>

**科林·罗伯逊**: 因为我认为我们不会接受一份糟糕的协议。而且我认为美国人今天向我们施压的方式，这会是一份糟糕的协议。欧洲人在四月份关税日之后经历了这种情况，他们现在都后悔了。我们以报复性关税作为回应。所以我们和中国人，我们后来部分取消了关税，以留在谈判桌旁，但这并没有给我们带来多大好处。我们再次撤回了数字服务税。我认为他是在玩弄我们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Colin Robertson**: Because I think we don't settle for a bad deal. And I think the way the Americans are pressuring us today, it would be a bad deal. The Europeans experienced this after tariff day in April and they're all have got bears remorse today. We responded with retaliatory tariffs. So we and the Chinese we've since lifted them in part to stay at the table and that hasn't really done us a lot of good. We pulled back the digital services tax again. I think he's playing us.

</details>

**主持人**: 玛莎，你认为 CUSMA 能否得以保留？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Martha say does Kuzma survive here?

</details>

**玛莎·霍尔·芬利**: 我认为两国之间的关系绝对会继续存在，无论最终看起来如何。正如我所说，在 80 年代自由贸易协定签署之前，我们有着非常非常密切的关系。嗯，那之后是 NAFTA，然后是现在的 USMCA CUSMA，这对两国经济都有好处吗？是的。所以，是的，能保留它会很好。这有两个方面。我认为时间是加拿大的盟友。我认为我们最大的盟友实际上是美国人，是美国企业。如果我们说 75% 的出口到美国，那么这意味着有很多人依赖加拿大的各种供应，在某些情况下是像钾肥和铀这样的重要物资，嗯，汽车是一个稍微独立的问题，因为汽车产业的整合。当然还有我们的能源和石油天然气。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Martha Hall Finley**: I think the relationship between the two countries absolutely survives what it ultimately looks like. As I said, we we had we had a a a very very close relationship before the free trade agreement was signed in the 80s. Um has that and then NAFTA and then now the USMCA koozma been been good for both economies. Yes. So yeah, it'd be great to keep it. There are two aspects to this. I think uh time is is Canada's ally. I think by far our biggest allies are in fact the Americans, the American businesses. If if you know we say 75% of our exports go to the United States, well that means we there are a whole lot of people relying on Canadian supplies of various things and in some cases really important things like potach and uranium and um uh cars is a bit of a separate thing because of the auto pack and of course our energy and oil and gas

</details>

**科林·罗伯逊**: 但这对许多美国人来说是一个重要的供应来源。美国企业在不得不以关税推高的价格购买铝或钢材时，会损害他们的业务。所以我的观点是，我们最大的盟友在这整个……我讨厌使用“谈判”这个词，因为它本不该是谈判，但在整个讨论中，时间站在我们这边，美国人和美国企业站在我们这边，因为这对他们有利。而且，你知道总理说过，我们不会签署一份糟糕的协议。宁可没有协议，也不能有糟糕的协议。我同意这一点。好的，玛莎，我想和你继续聊。科林提到了各省长今天与马克·卡尼的会晤。我意思是，我们听到了安大略省的省长相当直言不讳。我们听到了阿尔伯塔省的省长相当直言不讳。各省和各省长在这些谈判中扮演什么角色？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Colin Robertson**: but that's that's an important source of supply for so many Americans. Americans ans American businesses um when they have to buy aluminum or steel at an inflated price because of tariffs that hurts their business. So my view is um our our our be our biggest allies in this whole ne I hate to use the word negotiation because it's not supposed to be one but in this whole discussion um uh time is on our side and uh Americans and American businesses are on our side because it's beneficial to them and I I you know the prime minister has said we're we're not going to we're not going to sign a bad deal. Better to have no deal than have a bad deal. And I have to agree with that. All right, Martha, I want to stick with you. Uh Colin had brought up uh the premier's meeting with Mark Carney today. What role I mean we've heard uh the premier here in Ontario be quite vocal. We have heard the premier in Ottawa be uh in in Alberta rather be quite vocal. What role do the provinces and the premers play in these talks?

</details>

**玛莎·霍尔·芬利**: 嗯，他们不应该扮演的角色是单打独斗。这是一个挑战，我们偶尔会有不同的省长出去谈论国际事务，而实际上应该是一个协作的努力来支持我们所说的一切，但要有一个声音。我认为省长们在这里最大的作用有两个。一是继续努力维护我们已经拥有的关系，在这些关系中我们是供应商，我们是客户。例如，西部各州，农业，能源，你知道，与各州州长们合作，与他们对应的人合作。但这不一定是一场政治上的鼓吹，它只是意味着继续与那些理解这项安排重要性的人合作，并继续维持良好关系。并非所有美国人都支持唐纳德·特朗普的做法，所以我们需要继续维持这些关系。我认为省和省长们的另一个关键作用是，让我们把自己的家安顿好。我的意思是，我们仍然存在省际贸易壁垒。我的意思是，不点名的话，我们确实有一位省长站出来说，“我们将取消所有……你知道的，国内贸易壁垒”，然后在几周内通过了一项预算，给予本地啤酒厂优惠的税收待遇。我的意思是，你不能光说不做。所以我真的认为各省在这里可以发挥作用，你知道，稍微收敛一点，少些政治，多些“我们能不能解决这个问题”，这是一个时刻。如果我们现在不抓住这个机会来解决其中一些国内问题，那我们就太糟糕了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Martha Hall Finley**: Well, what role they shouldn't play is oneoffs? Um this is a this is a challenge and we do occasionally have different premers going out and you know speaking about things international when really it should be a collaborative effort to support whatever we say but with one voice. Um I would say the biggest role the premers have here is there's there are two big roles. One is to continue to work those relationships that we already have where we're a supplier where we're customer. um the western states for example the egg the energy the you know working with the governors their counterparts in the states working with you know but this doesn't have to be a political rahrah it just means continue to work with the people who understand the importance of this arrangement and continue to maintain those good relations not all Americans are supportive of what Donald Trump is doing so we need to continue to maintain those relationships and I think the other key role for the pro provinces and the provincial premers is to Let's get our own house in order. I mean, we still have interprovincial trade barriers. I mean, without naming names, we did have one premier get up and say, "We're just going to get rid of all of our, you know, internal trade barriers and within a few weeks passed a budget that gave preferential uh tax treatment to the local breweries." I mean, the the you just can't say and then not do. So I really think the provinces have a role to play here in you know a bit of water in their wine little bit of you know less politics and more can we just figure this out and it's a moment in time like if we don't take this opportunity now to address some of these internal problems then shame on us.

</details>

**主持人**: 科林，有很多关注点在于如果美国退出谈判会怎样，但有没有出现加拿大决定“这不适合我们，我们要退出谈判桌”的情况？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Colin, there has been a lot of focus on what happens if the US, pardon my language, negotiations, walk away from these negotiations, but what is there is there a situation where Canada uh decides, you know what, this is not for us. We're going to take a step away from the table.

</details>

**科林·罗伯逊**: 是的，我们在最初的谈判中就这么做了，当时**西蒙·里**是我们的首席谈判代表，主要是关于争端解决。所以我们退出了，然后时钟停止了。我们在最后一刻不得不停止时钟，因为再次涉及到争端解决，最终是**德里克·伯尼**和**迈克·威尔逊**说：“好吧，我们要走了。”然后当时的财政部长**詹姆斯·贝克**被告知他们将打电话给**布莱恩·马洛尼**，让他打电话给当时正在加州度周末的**罗纳德·里根**。然后贝克回来，说：“好吧，但你得让国会通过。”我们做到了。所以，不，这会很困难，而且可能会拖得很久。NAFTA 协议要容易得多，但正如我所说，加拿大-美国自由贸易协定，我们退出了好几周，然后最后，我们不得不停止时钟。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Colin Robertson**: Yes, we did that in the very first negotiations with Simon Ree as our chief negotiator really around dispute settlement. So we walked away and at the clock stopped. We had to stop the clock on the very last day because again it came down to dispute settlement and it ended up with Derek Bernie and Mike Wilson saying, "Well, we're going to walk away." And James Baker, then Secretary of the Treasury, being told that they were going to phone Brian Maloney and have him phone Ronald Reagan in California where he was spending the weekend. And Baker came back and said, "Okay, but you got to get this through Congress." Which we did. So, no, it's going to be difficult and it it'll probably go extra innings. The NAFTA was much easier to do, but certainly the Canada US free trade agreement, as I say, we walked out for several weeks and then at the end of the day, we had to stop the clock.

</details>

**主持人**: 玛莎曾提到 CUSMA 对加拿大经济的重要性。你提到了 75%，65%。如果这项协议不能维持，或者说没有被采纳，这对加拿大经济意味着什么，科林？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Martha had sort of touched on uh how important uh KUSMA is to the Canadian economy. You had mentioned the 75%, the 65%. just give us a sense if if this deal does not stand uh does not get picked up, what does it mean for the Canadian economy, Colin?

</details>

**科林·罗伯逊**: 嗯，这意味着我们要支付关税。无论如何我们可能都要支付关税。嗯，可能在 10% 到 15% 之间，具体取决于唐纳德·特朗普每天的心情，但我们……所以这意味着，我们仍然拥有邻近性和地理位置以及现有供应链的优势，但这意味着对美国消费者和加拿大人造成打击。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Colin Robertson**: Well, it means we're going to pay tariffs. We may be paying tariffs in any event. uh probably 10 to 15% depending on the capricciousness of Donald Trump in any day but we so that means uh we're we still have the advantage of proximity and geography and existing supply chains but it means attacks on American consumers and attacks on Canadians.

</details>

**玛莎·霍尔·芬利**: 嗯，我完全同意，但为了把事情说清楚，即使是我们现在征收的关税，也有一些行业明显受到影响，比如钢铁、铝，你知道，汽车方面的事情悬而未决，我的意思是，这个行业是如此的整合……一辆汽车，考虑到它的所有零部件，最终会多次跨越边境，所以这很复杂，但是……嗯，这很复杂。但为了我们的利益和美国的利益，我们无法改变地理位置。而且，尽管一些行业受到的打击更大，就像我说的，嗯，总的来说，经济学家们说，总体而言，关税对整个加拿大经济的影响不到 5%。嗯，而且我们在经济活动方面实际上一直在增长。我认为，拥有自信也很重要，它会发出非常强烈的信息。我再说一遍，我们需要与各州长合作。我们需要与商业利益合作。可以肯定的是，现在有重大的商业利益对唐纳德·特朗普的做法感到不满。总有一天，他将不得不认识到，这其中包含了许多选民。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Martha Hall Finley**: uh totally agree but to put things into perspective even with the tariffs that we have now there are some sectors that are clearly suffering steel aluminum you know who knows that auto stuff is so up in the air I mean that industry is so integrated a car given all of its components ultimately goes across the border a number of times so that's complicated but um it it it it's it's complicated But for our benefit and for the American benefit, we can't change geography. And even though some industries are have been hit harder, like I said, um overall the economists are saying that overall the tariff hit for the overall Canadian economy is less than 5%. Um and we've actually been picking up steam in terms of our economic activity. I think you know having a having a confidence in oneself is also really important that sends very strong messages. I go back to we need to work with the governors. We need to work with the the the business interests. Guaranteed there are significant business interests right now that are not happy with what Donald Trump is doing. And at some point he's going to have to recognize that that includes a lot of voters.

</details>

**主持人**: 玛莎，你提到了复杂。嗯，请帮我理解一下，加拿大如何看待……正如我们所见，它正在达成协议，正如马克·卡尼正在旅行……与中国达成协议。总理如何平衡达成这些协议，同时又清楚地知道，当他与唐纳德·特朗普打交道时，可能会有威胁……你知道，100% 的关税威胁。嗯，在努力实现多元化的同时，如何达成这些协议？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Martha, you mentioned complicated. Um I help me understand how does Canada as we've seen with you know the deals it is striking as as Mark Carney is traveling uh making a deal with China. How does how does the prime minister balance making these deals while knowing full well that there are threats uh that are probably looming when he touches back uh into North America from Donald Trump with you know 100% tariff threats. Uh how do you make those deals while while trying to diversify?

</details>

**玛莎·霍尔·芬利**: 嗯，这是，你知道，认真对待特朗普，但不要照字面意思理解。如果他真的要征收 100% 的关税，嗯，美国企业会群起反对。我的意思是，这根本不可能发生。而且请注意，他实际上并没有……没有兑现。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Martha Hall Finley**: Well, this is, you know, take Trump Trump seriously, but not literally. If he were if he were to impose 100% tariffs, uh the American businesses would be up in arms. I mean, it's just not going to happen. And notice he hasn't actually fallen uh uh followed through.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，嗯，而且，而且要强调多元化这一点，它有两个方面。一是政治定位，基本上是说，看，我们对加拿大有信心。我们将与其他合作伙伴合作。我们将扩大我们的经济……替代方案。我们永远不会只与中国而不是美国进行贸易。地理位置在那里。我们企业的相互联系。我们将继续保持两国之间的大规模贸易。嗯，对我来说，多元化努力不是替代品。它是一个附加项，因为坦率地说，我们的经济可以做得更多，而且我们可以不依赖一个客户或一个供应商。所以这些努力实际上是我们已经与美国拥有的东西的补充。它们不是为了……嗯……嗯……它们不是为了取代它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Um and and it and to stress the diversification thing, there are two aspects to that. One is a political positioning to basically say, look, we are confident in Canada. We're going to work with other partners. we're going to expand our economic uh alternatives. There will never be a day when we only trade with China instead of the United States. The geography is there. The interconnectedness of our businesses. We're going to continue to have massive trade between our two countries. Um for me, the diversification effort is it's not a replacement. It's an add-on because frankly, our economy could do with more activity and we could do with not relying on one customer or one supplier. So these are these efforts are actually in addition to what we already have with the United States. They're not to uh um uh they're not to they're not to replace it.

</details>

**玛莎·霍尔·芬利**: 嗯，而且，而且坦率地说，我认为这对加拿大人、加拿大企业和加拿大政治家来说是一个警钟。嗯，迫使我们寻找其他替代方案来实现多元化，嗯，而不是取代与美国的安排，但我认为这对我们来说是一件非常重要的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Martha Hall Finley**: Um and and frankly I think this has been as a wakeup call to Canadians and Canadian businesses and Canadian politicians. um forcing us to look at other alternatives to diversify um not to replace the American arrangement but to add to it I think is a very important thing for us to do.

</details>

**主持人**: 科林，加拿大能从欧盟和美国去年达成的贸易协议中学到什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Colin, what can Canada learn uh from the trade deal that was reached by the European Union and the US uh just last year?

</details>

**科林·罗伯逊**: 嗯，没必要的时候不要轻举妄动。我认为他们离开了，他们现在后悔了。但我想我们真正需要做的，所以应该是首先处理加拿大的国内贸易壁垒，其次是找出，让我们的资源出土，加工它们，然后销往国外。所以，我认为我们有很多国内工作要做。我认为游戏始于我们自己，然后我们才能处理其余的事情。贸易多元化是可以的，但正如玛莎所说，这是一次对我们自满情绪的震动，也是一个提醒，我们可以在国内自己做很多事情来提高生产力。

<details>

**Colin Robertson**: Well, don't jump when you don't have to. I think they they left and they have buyers remorse. But I think what we really have to do and so would be to first of all deal with the internal trade barriers in Canada and secondly find out get our resources out of the ground, process them and then sell them abroad. So I think we've got a lot of work to do at home. I think that the game starts with ourselves and then we can deal with the rest. The diversification of trade is fine, but as Martha says, this this is a shakeup of our complacency, but also a reminder that we can do an awful lot at home ourselves to make ourselves more productive.

### 加拿大内部改革与外部盟友

**玛莎·霍尔·芬利**: 为什么？是的。为什么现在加拿大面临买家……我认为我们目前面临的最大挑战是，嗯，重新陷入自满。这就是，这就是加拿大目前的状态和态度。这是一个巨大的机会。我们在所有政党之间都有共识，即我们需要实现多元化，我们需要建设我们的贸易基础设施，我们需要取消省际贸易壁垒，我们需要处理监管负担过重的问题，我特意这么说，我不会说有些监管实际上非常好而且非常重要，但我们有太多了，我们有重叠，我们有……在其中一些问题上，政治上有一致的意见。我们可能做的最糟糕的事情就是重新陷入自满，而没有真正抓住这个机会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Martha Hall Finley**: Martha, why? Yeah. Why buyers facing Canada right now? I think the biggest challenge facing us right now is um a slide back into complacency. This is this the state of attitude right now in the in in Canada is a huge opportunity. we have alignment and all across political parties um that we need to diversify that we need to build our trade infrastructure that we need to get rid of interprovincial trade barriers we need to deal with the regulatory overburden and I say that on purpose I'm not going to say some regulation is actually really good and really important but we have too much we have overlap we have an incredible time of political um agreement on some of these things the worst thing that we could do is to slide back into complacency without actually taking this opportunity.

**主持人**: 科林，我们还剩一分钟。最后一个问题给你。玛莎提到了一些加拿大需要去的地方，或者说需要看谁作为我们的盟友。如果加拿大希望 CUSMA 继续存在，在美国的盟友是谁？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Colin, we have uh one minute left. Last question to you. Martha had mentioned a little bit of sort of where Canada needs to go or who to look to uh in terms of our allies here. If Canada wants Koosma to continue, who are the allies in the US?

</details>

**科林·罗伯逊**: 哦，任何与加拿大做生意的人都是。既有买我们的，也有卖给我们的。我们的计算是，大约有 800 万个工作岗位。我们不能游说和捐款给竞选活动。我们可以做的是，进入每个选区的立法者，并指出这里有加拿大的投资，为你的选区创造了就业机会。这里是你选区内正在向加拿大销售或从加拿大购买零部件的公司，然后我们进一步制造。所以，正如玛莎所说，我们有各种各样的盟友，我们必须做的是进行全面的、全方位的努力，这不仅仅是大使馆，不仅仅是总理，还有各省长、立法者、商界人士。任何在美国做生意的人都必须提醒他们的供应商或他们购买的供应商和供应商，这很重要，并告诉他们去联系他们的国会议员。这个信息会传达给白宫，而这正是我们要关注的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Colin Robertson**: Oh, it's anybody who's doing business with Canada. It's both those who buy from us and those who sell to us. We our reckoning is there's about 8 million jobs. We don't can't lobby and give to campaigns. What we can do is go in and see each legislator by district and point out here are here's the Canadian investment in your district that creates jobs. Here are the companies in your district that are selling to Canada or buying parts from Canada which we then further manufacture. So, as Martha said, we've got all sorts of allies and that's what we have to do is have a full all court press and it's more than the embassy, more than the prime minister, it's the premers, the legislators, it's business people. Anybody doing business in the states has got to remind their suppliers or the people they're buying and vendors that they're this is important to them and tell them to address their congressman. That message will get through to the White House and that's where we're going to have to listen to.

</details>

**主持人**: 这就是我们要结束的地方。科林，非常感谢。玛莎，非常感谢你的时间。我们非常感谢你的见解。

**主持人**: 总理**马克·卡尼**和中国国家主席**习近平**最近宣布，在两国紧张关系多年后，他们达成了一项协议。中国电动汽车的关税将被取消，涉及多达 49,000 辆汽车，以换取中国降低其对菜籽油的关税。省长**道格·福特**最初对这项协议并不满意，非常不满意。但与总理会晤似乎使他冷静下来。策略是成立一个工作组，安大略省将就策略和就业保护进行咨询。那么，中国电动汽车在这里的市场有多大？这个国家的司机们会接受它们吗？我采访了**加拿大汽车记者协会**前主席**斯蒂芬妮·沃尔克拉夫特**，谈论了更便宜的电动汽车如何在安大略省和加拿大其他地区推出，以及这将如何颠覆市场。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Prime Minister Mark Carney and Chinese President Xi Jinping recently announced they'd struck a deal after years of tension between their two countries. Tariffs on Chinese EVs will be lifted on up to 49,000 vehicles in exchange for China lowering its tariffs on canola. Premier Doug Ford wasn't initially happy about the deal. not happy at all. But a meeting with the prime minister seems to have brought the temperature down. The strategy, a task force with Ontario to consult on strategy and job protection. So, how big could the market here be for Chinese EVs? Will the drivers of this country embrace them? I sat down with Stephanie Walcraft, former president of the Automotive Journalist Association of Canada to talk about how cheaper EVs will roll out in Ontario and the rest of Canada and how much this will shake up the market.

### 中国电动汽车涌入加拿大

**主持人**: 斯蒂芬妮，很高兴你能来节目。你怎么样？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Stephanie, great to have you on the show. How are you doing?

</details>

**斯蒂芬妮·沃尔克拉夫特**: 很好，谢谢。很高兴来到这里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephanie Walcraft**: Doing great, thanks. Uh, very happy to be here.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的，我们来谈谈……道格·福特。首先，他的态度有点转变。自从他与总理马克·卡尼和工业部长**梅兰妮·朱莉**会晤以来，他没有呼吁抵制中国电动汽车。你认为他们可能告诉了他什么关于这个计划？我知道有很多细节我们也很想知道，但你认为是什么让他稍微冷静下来了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right, we're going to talk uh about Doug Ford. First off, a bit of a change of tune. He hasn't called for a boycott of Chinese EVs since he met with uh Prime Minister Mark Carney and Industry Minister Melanie Jolie. What do you think they might have told him about the plan? I know there's lots of details that we'd like to know about it as well, but what do you think has kind of settled him a little bit?

</details>

**斯蒂芬妮·沃尔克拉夫特**: 我不比其他人更了解情况，但我的猜测是，在那间发生事情的房间里发生了什么，我猜道格·福特看到了美元符号。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephanie Walcraft**: And I'm not any more privy to information than anybody else, but my guess is not what whatever happened in that room where it happened. I think Doug Ford was shown some dollar signs.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Okay.

</details>

**斯蒂芬妮·沃尔克拉夫特**: 是的。我感觉，中国-加拿大安排的某些方面涉及将一些车辆制造带到加拿大。可能是车辆，也可能是电池。这很有意义……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephanie Walcraft**: Yes. I have a feeling that there are aspects of this China Canada arrangement that involve bringing some manufacturing of vehicles to Canada. Vehicles possibly also batteries. It makes a lot of sense

</details>

**主持人**: 他想要的……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: what he wants,

</details>

**斯蒂芬妮·沃尔克拉夫特**: 对吧？回想一下卡迪总理在达沃斯提出的观点，即加拿大拥有世界所需的东西，当我们谈论加拿大拥有汽车行业所需的东西时，那就是关键矿产。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephanie Walcraft**: right? Speaking back to the point that Prime Minister Cardi made in Davos that Canada has what the world wants when we're talking about what Canada has that the auto industry wants. That's critical minerals,

</details>

**主持人**: 对吧？所以，这在财政上是合理的，或者看起来是这样，因为我们现在看到其他汽车制造商也在争夺这个领域。大众汽车正在圣托马斯郊外建造一个电池厂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: right? So, it makes fiscal sense or it seems to because we're now seeing other automakers jockeying for position on this as well. Volkswagen's building a battery plant outside of St. Thomas.

</details>

**斯蒂芬妮·沃尔克拉夫特**: 我们本周早些时候了解到，韩国和加拿大签署了一份谅解备忘录，可能将一些制造、电池和车辆带到加拿大。这与潜艇交易有关，那是另一个话题，对吧？但回到中国，这些联系都表明，在矿产来源地建造电池和汽车比将它们运往世界各地更有财政意义。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephanie Walcraft**: We just earlier this week learned that um South Korea and uh and Canada signed a memorandum of understanding around possibly bringing some manufacturing battery and vehicle to Canada. And that's related to the submarine deal which is a whole other topic, right? But bringing that back to China, that those dots all connect to making it seem as though it makes fiscal sense to build the batteries and build the cars where the minerals are coming from rather than shipping them around the world.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以我想，这项协议中有一部分尚未公开，可能涉及随着时间的推移扩大进入加拿大的配额，对吧？同时，中国也在进行一些制造投资，这当然会带来就业机会，并提振经济。考虑到安大略省北部正在开发的“火环”，这似乎很有道理，制造将在安大略省进行。这就回到了道格·福特很高兴的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So I would imagine there's a portion of this deal that hasn't gone public yet that may involve scaling up the the quota that comes into Canada over time, right? And with that also China making some manufacturing investment which of course brings jobs and just bolsters the economy. It makes a lot of sense with the ring of fire being developed in Northern Ontario that that would end up being in Ontario where that manufacturing would take place. And that brings us back to Doug Ford being a happy man.

</details>

### 加拿大电动汽车市场分析

**主持人**: 好的。我们暂时离开头条新闻。我想谈谈……去年的一些数据。2025 年，加拿大电动汽车销量暴跌。这不是欧洲、非洲、中东、中国的故事，它们都在增长。为什么加拿大的电动汽车销量如此之低？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. Well, let's get away from the headlines for a minute. I want to talk about um some numbers from last year. Sales of electric vehicles in Canada plummeted in 2025. not the story. When we look at Europe, across Africa, the Middle East, China, they roast. Why are EV sales in Canada so low?

</details>

**斯蒂芬妮·沃尔克拉夫特**: 这很大程度上归结于价格，这就是我们讨论整个主题的原因，对吧？为了让任何不熟悉加拿大-中国协议的人都能理解，加拿大承诺从中国进口 49,000 辆电动汽车，关税降低。之前是 100% 的关税，以匹配美国的水平。现在是 6.1%，这是一个显著的下降，对吧？嗯，回到你的观点，欧洲、中东和其他市场已经获得了这些便宜的……对吧？电动汽车。这 49,000 辆配额的 50% 是要在船上定价低于 35,000 美元，至于这是否能转化为经销商处的价格是另一回事，但这确实说明了我们在这个价位上没有类似产品。在我们市场。而且这……这创造了提升的空间，尤其是在联邦政府取消了电动汽车补贴之后，而这些补贴是唯一能让其中一些汽车接近那个价格水平的东西，这恰好与你提到的销量下降同时发生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephanie Walcraft**: A lot of that comes down to price, which is why we're talking about this entire subject, right? To to recap for anybody who's not familiar with the the Canada China deal. It's 49,000 EVs that Canada has committed to bringing in from China at a lower tariff. There was a 100% tariff that was in place uh to match with the United States. This is 6.1% a significant drop right um and to come back to your point Europe and the Middle East and other markets are already getting those those cheap right EVs 50% of that allotment of the 49,000 is meant to be priced off the boat at least under 35,000 whether that's going to equate to that when it gets to dealership lots is a different story but that does speak to the point that we don't have anything at that price point in our market right And this this creates the potential to to bolster that especially in the wake of the federal government having canceled the EV rebates which were the only thing that were bringing some of those cars even close to that rep level and that coincided exactly with that drop in sales that you were talking about.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么，可以说从中国进口的汽车目前在加拿大并没有真正的竞争对手吗？是否存在一个明显的差距，或者……给我一个关于现在电动汽车价格的……现在在加拿大的电动汽车平均成本是多少？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So fair to say the cars that would be imported from China here don't necessarily have competition right now in Canada. There is a a glaring gap or give us an idea of sort of maybe what is the price of a of an EV right now? Now, an average cost of an Eevee right now in Canada,

</details>

**斯蒂芬妮·沃尔克拉夫特**: 存在一个明显的差距。嗯，是否称之为“明显”取决于很多背景。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephanie Walcraft**: there is a glaring gap. Well, whether I'd call it glaring depends on a lot of context.

</details>

**主持人**: 现在，我们看到一辆 2027 年款雪佛兰 Bolt，有趣的是，它已经被停产了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Right now, we're looking at a 2027 Chevrolet Bolt, which interesting has which interestingly has already been discontinued.

</details>

**斯蒂芬妮·沃尔克拉夫特**: 哦，好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephanie Walcraft**: Oh, okay.

</details>

[laughter]

**斯蒂芬妮·沃尔克拉夫特**: 完全是另一个话题，但它的建议零售价制造商建议零售价略低于 40,000 美元，不含税费。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephanie Walcraft**: Different subject entirely, but that is priced at an MSRP manufacturer's suggested retail price of just under 40,000 before fees.

</details>

**主持人**: 这离我们谈论的 35,000 美元不远。而且某些省份和地区仍然提供回扣。所以，在国内一些地方，你可以以更便宜的价格买到那辆车。所以，并不是说它不存在，而是它不像应该有的那样普及。这个故事的另一方面是，我们是否会立即看到来自中国制造商的廉价电动汽车？对吧？这是我第一次听到这个消息时谈论过的事情。49,000 辆相对于加拿大汽车行业的总体规模来说，只是九牛一毛。我们每年销售约 190 万辆汽车。所以……而电动汽车占其中的约 5%。所以我们谈论的是，从这项协议中，我们从中国进口的约占整个市场的 2.5% 到 2.6%。所以，在这个早期阶段，这不足以在任何层面上引起巨大波澜。但它确实给其他汽车制造商带来了压力，迫使它们开始降低价格，而回扣的初衷就是弥补电动汽车最初更昂贵的事实，并且 meant to be……当价格降至与内燃机汽车相当时，回扣就 meant to be 取消。它们从来都不是 meant to be 永久性的。对吧？对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: That's not that far off that 35,000 that we're talking about. and certain provinces and territories still do offer rebates. So, there are places in the country where you can get that car for cheaper. So it's not that it doesn't exist, but it's more that it's not as widespread as it could be. The other aspect of that storyline is do we immediately see those cheap EVs coming from Chinese manufacturers? Right? This is something that I spoke to when the news first broke. 49,000 is not it's a drop in the bucket relative to the Canadian auto industry in general. We sell about 1.9 million cars a year. So that and the EV portion of that is about 5%. So we're talking about roughly 2.5 2.6% of the full market is what we're bringing in in from this deal from China. And that's not enough to make huge waves at at any level at this early stage. But it does put pressure on other automakers to to start bringing those prices down, which is the rebates were always meant to just make up for the fact that EVs were more expensive initially and were meant to the rebates were meant to be removed when those prices came down to be at par with internal combustion engine vehicles. They were never meant to be permanent. Right. Right.

</details>

**斯蒂芬妮·沃尔克拉夫特**: 所以，这实际上是让那些中国……特别是中国电动汽车重新进入市场。它们弥补了损失，并将汽车……那些电动汽车的价格降至可以与内燃机汽车直接竞争的水平。我们会立即看到那些 35,000 美元的比亚迪或小鹏，那些中国品牌吗？我不知道这是否会立即发生，因为你谈论的是一个汽车制造商必须进入这个国家，建立一个总部，建立一个经销商网络。这需要时间，对吧？而且一些加拿大人没有意识到的是，中国制造的电动汽车已经在加拿大道路上行驶了，对吧？我们谈论中国电动汽车时，指的是我刚才提到的那些品牌，但中国制造的电动汽车已经在我们道路上行驶了一段时间了，对吧？特斯拉在 2023 年仅 Model Wise 就进口了 44,000 辆。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephanie Walcraft**: So what this does is sort of bring those Chinese those Chinese EVs in particular back. They they they make up that loss and and bring cars back, those EVs back down to a level where they can compete directly on price with internal combustion engine vehicles. Will we see immediately those $35,000 BYDs or Xpangs, those Chinese brands? I don't know if that's going to be an immediate thing because you're talking about an automaker having to come into the country, set up a head office, set up a dealership network. That takes time, right? And what some Canadians don't realize is there are already Chinese-built EVs on Canadian roads, right? We talk about Chinese EVs in terms of those brands I just brought up, but there are Chinesebuilt EVs that have been on our roads for a while, right? Tesla Tesla built imported 44,000 just Model Wise in 2023.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以这几乎接近我们谈论的 49,000 辆，对吧？嗯，一些人一直担心的一件事，我不知道这是否是你的专业领域内的真正担忧，但加拿大对中国访问加拿大电动汽车用户数据有何担忧，而对北美汽车制造商却没有这种担忧？因为我认为，当我们谈论电动汽车时，我们直接跳到了安全问题，但北美有……北美制造的电动汽车，它们也可能存在同样的担忧，但我们没有那些危险信号。我不知道是不是电动汽车本身是讨论的焦点。我认为更多的是汽车来自中国，而且它们里面有很多软件，很多技术。有趣的是，是黑莓……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So that's pretty darn close to that 49,000 that we're talking about, right? Uh, one of the things uh that uh a few people have been concerned about and I don't know if it's a genuine concern from from your expertise, but what worries does Canada have about Chinese access to Canadian EV user data uh that it doesn't have already with North American automakers? Because I think one when we talk about EVs, we we jump right to security concerns, but there are EVs here in North America, North American made that uh that potentially could have the same concerns, but we don't have those red flags. I don't know that it's the fact that it's EVs specifically that are the the discussion point there. I think it's more that the cars are coming from China and they have an awful lot of software in them, a lot of technology in them. Interestingly, it's Blackberry

### 电动汽车数据安全与未来

**斯蒂芬妮·沃尔克拉夫特**: 实际上为比亚迪提供软件。所以加拿大和中国之间已经有了联系，加拿大也深度参与其中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Stephanie Walcraft**: that actually supplies the software for BYD. So there's already a Canada China connection there and Canada's deeply involved in that.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么，这是阴谋论还是事实？很难说。但确实有一些关于……你知道，非常高级的国家安全问题的讨论，比如……这听起来很疯狂，但中国曾被指控在中国的车辆中植入关停程序，以便他们能够远程阻止车辆工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So is it tinfoil hat or not? It's hard to say. But there has been some discussion of you know really high level national security things like it's it sounds crazy but China has been accused of putting shutdown operations in in Chinese-built vehicles so that so that they would have a way to remotely just prevent them from the vehicle from working

</details>

**主持人**: 对，现在在宣布汽车工作组时，朱莉部长确实提到了这一点，并说国家安全问题正在他们的关注之中。非常感谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: right now in the announcement of the the auto working group uh minister Jolie did address that and said that that national security concern is on their radar. Thank you so much.

</details>

**斯蒂芬妮·沃尔克拉夫特**: 我很荣幸。
