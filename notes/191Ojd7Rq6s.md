### AI发展现状：乐观与悲观的交锋

似乎没有什么根本性的难题是世界上最聪明的人在未来五年内努力工作无法解决的。

<p class="english-text">Nothing seems fundamentally so hard that it couldn't be solved by the smartest people in the world working incredibly hard for the next five years.</p>
</details>

人类经历了农业革命和工业革命，我们正在经历另一场革命，我们现在无法称呼它，未来的人们会给它命名，但我们确实正在经历一些事情。这项技术将赋能的**独立创业者**（Solo Entrepreneurs: 独立经营自己业务的个人）数量将大幅增加，它极大地提升了个人所能做的事情。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Humanity went through the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution. We're going through another revolution. We will not be able to call it something. It's like future people will call it something. But we are going through something. The number of solo entrepreneurs that this technology is going to enable. It's vastly increased what a single person can do.</p>
</details>

机会首次大规模地向所有人开放，让更多人能够成为创业者的能力是巨大的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">For the first time, opportunity is massively available for everyone. Just the ability for more people to be able to become entrepreneurs is Yeah, it's massive.</p>
</details>

Adam D'Angelo表示，很多人最近对**大语言模型**（LLMs: Large Language Models，基于海量文本数据训练，能够理解和生成人类语言的人工智能模型）泼冷水，普遍存在悲观情绪，人们谈论LLM的局限性，认为它们无法将我们带到**通用人工智能**（AGI: Artificial General Intelligence，指能够理解、学习或执行任何人类智力任务的AI）的阶段，也许我们原以为只需几年就能实现的目标现在可能需要十年。然而，Adam D'Angelo似乎更为乐观，他分享了自己的总体看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Adam, welcome to the podcast. Thank you. Yeah, thanks for having us. So, a lot of people have been throwing cold water over LLMs lately. It's been some general bearishness. People talking about the limitations of of LLMs, why they won't get us to AGI. Well, maybe uh what we thought was just a couple years away is now maybe 10 years away. Adam, you seem a bit more optimistic. Why don't you share your broad general overview?</p>
</details>

Adam D'Angelo坦言，他不知道人们在谈论什么。他认为，如果回顾一年前，世界截然不同。仅从过去一年在推理模型、代码生成能力、视频生成等方面的进步来看，事情似乎比以往任何时候都发展得更快。因此，他不太理解这种悲观情绪从何而来。他认为，可能有人觉得我们曾希望LLM能够替代所有任务或所有工作，但现在看来，它可能只是解决了中间环节，而非端到端的问题，劳动力自动化可能不会像我们预期的那样迅速。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I mean I I actually honestly I don't know what people are talking about. I think I think if you look a year ago, the world was very different. And so just judging on how much progress we've made in the last year with things like reasoning models, um things like the improvement in code generation ability, um the improvements in video gen, it seems like things are going faster than ever. And so I I don't really understand where the the kind of bearishness is coming from. Well, I think there's some sense that we hoped that they would be able to um replace all of tasks or all all jobs. And maybe there's some sense that it's like middle to middle but not end to end. And maybe, you know, labor won't be automated in the same way that we we thought it would on the same timeline.</p>
</details>

Adam D'Angelo表示，他不知道人们之前设想的时间线是怎样的，但他认为，如果展望五年后，我们将生活在一个非常不同的世界。他觉得目前阻碍模型发展的并非智能本身，而是如何将正确的**上下文**（Context: 指模型在处理信息时可参考的相关背景信息或数据）输入模型，使其能够运用其智能。此外，像计算机使用这样的功能尚未完全实现，但他相信未来一两年内肯定会实现。一旦具备这些能力，我们将能够自动化大部分人类工作。他不知道这是否能称之为AGI，但他认为这将满足人们目前提出的许多批评，这些批评在一两年内将不再有效。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean, I I don't know what the previous timelines people were were thinking were, but you know, I think I think if you if you go 5 years out from now, we're in a very different world. I think I think a lot of what's holding back the models these days is not actually intelligence. It's getting the right context into the model so that it can be able to to use its intelligence. Um, and then there's some things like computer use that are still not quite there, but I I think we'll almost definitely get there in the next year or two. And when you have that, I I think we're going to be able to automate a large portion of what people do. I don't think I don't know if I would call that AGI, but I I think it's going to satisfy a a lot of the critiques that people are making right now. I I think they won't be valid in in a year or two.</p>
</details>

### AGI的定义与实现路径

关于AGI的定义，Adam D'Angelo认为每个人都有不同的看法。他比较喜欢的一种定义是，如果你有一个远程工作者，任何可以远程完成的工作，如果AI能够完成，那就是AGI。你可以进一步争论它是否必须在每项工作中都比世界上最好的人更出色（有些人称之为**超级人工智能**，ASI），或者是否必须比团队更出色。但Adam D'Angelo认为，一旦AI在典型远程工作者所做的工作中表现得更好，我们将生活在一个非常不同的世界。他觉得这是一个非常有用的定义锚点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is your definition of AGI? I don't know. Everyone everyone thinks it's something different. I think I mean you know one one definition I I I I kind of like is um if you say that you have a remote worker a human any job that could be done by someone whose job can be done remotely um that that's AGI you know you can you can then say does have to be better than the best person in the world at every single job some people call that ASI um does have to be better than teams of people you can you can argue with those different definitions. But I I think once we get to be better than a typical remote worker at the job they're doing, we're living in a a very different world. And I think that's that's effectively what people that that's a very useful anchor point for for these definitions.</p>
</details>

Adam D'Angelo总结道，他并未感受到其他人所说的LLM局限性。他认为LLM仍有很大的发展空间，我们不需要全新的架构或其他突破。他觉得，虽然记忆和持续学习等某些方面在当前架构下不太容易实现，但即使这些也可以通过某种方式“模拟”，并可能达到足够好的效果。他表示，我们似乎没有遇到任何限制，推理模型的进步令人难以置信，**预训练**（Pre-training: 指模型在大量数据上进行初步训练，以学习通用特征和知识）的进展也相当迅速。虽然可能没有人们预期的那么快，但足以在未来几年内取得巨大进步。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So in summary, you're not sensing the same limitations of LM that other people are. You think there's a lot more room that LMS can can go from here? We don't need like a brand new architecture or other breakthrough. I don't think so. I mean I I think there are certain things like memory and learning like continuous learning that are not very easy with the current architectures. I think even those you can sort of fake and maybe we're going to be able to to get them to work well enough. Um but we we just don't seem to be hitting any kind of of limits. The the progress in reasoning models is incredible. And I think the progress in in pre-training is is also going pretty quickly. Maybe not as quickly as people had expected, but certainly fast enough that you can expect a lot of progress over over the next few years.</p>
</details>

Amjad Masad对此回应称，他一直保持着相当一致的看法，甚至可以说是“一贯正确”。他表示，大约在2022-2023年AI安全讨论达到高潮时，他开始公开质疑一些观点，认为我们有必要对AI的进展保持现实态度。他担心过度炒作会吓到政客，导致监管机构介入并关闭一切。因此，他对“AGI 2027”之类的想法持批评态度，以及那些“炒作论文”——它们并非真正的科学，而只是一种“氛围”预测，例如“整个经济将被自动化”、“工作将消失”等等。Amjad Masad认为这些预测不切实际，不符合我们目前看到的进展，并且会导致糟糕的政策。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amad, what's your what's your reaction hearing all this? Yeah, I I I think I've been pretty consistent and consistently right perhaps dare I say consistent with yourself or consistent with what I'm saying with with um with myself and with I think how things are unfolding that uh you know I started being a bit of a more public doubter of of things around uh the time when the AI safety discussion was uh was reaching its height back in maybe 22 23. Um, and I I thought it was important for us to be realistic about the progress. Um, because, you know, otherwise we're going to scare politicians. We're going to scare everyone. You know, uh, DC will descend on Silicon Valley. We they'll shut everything down. So my criticism of the idea of like AGI 2027, you know, that paper that I think it's called Alexander, someone else wrote uh and then um and the situational awareness and all this uh hype papers that are not really science, they're just vibe. Here's what I think will happen. Uh you know, the whole economy will get automated. You know, jobs are uh are going to disappear. all of that stuff is that again is just I think um it's unrealistic. It is not following the kind of progress that we're seeing and it is uh going to lead to just bad policy.</p>
</details>

Amjad Masad认为LLM是了不起的机器，但它们并非完全等同于人类智能。他指出，LLM仍然可以通过一些简单的问题被“欺骗”，例如“这个句子中有多少个R？”。他曾在推特上提到，四个模型中有三个未能正确回答，即使是GPT-5在“高思考”模式下也需要思考约15秒才能回答此类问题。因此，他认为LLM是一种不同于人类的智能，它们有明显的局限性。我们正在通过各种方式（无论是LLM本身、训练数据还是围绕其的基础设施）来弥补这些局限性。这让他对我们已经“破解”智能的说法不那么乐观。他相信，一旦我们真正破解了智能，它会感觉更具可扩展性，并且可以通过投入更多的算力、资源和计算能力来自然地扩展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So my view is LMS are amazing amazing machines. Uh I don't think they are exactly human uh intelligence equivalent. You can still trick LMS with things like they might have solved the strawberry one, but you can still, you know, uh trick it with like single sentence questions like how many Rs are in this sentence. I think I think I tweeted about it the other day, which was like three out of the four four models couldn't didn't get it even. Um and then GP5 with high thinking had to think for like 15 seconds in order to get a question like that. So uh LMS are I think a different kind of intelligence than uh what humans are uh and also uh they have they have clear limitations and we're papering over the limitations and we're kind of working around them in all sorts of ways whether it's in the LLM itself and the training data or uh and the infrastructure around and everything that we're we're doing to make them work. Um but that that makes me less optimistic that we're we've we've cracked intelligence. And I think once we truly crack intelligence um it'll feel a lot more scalable and that you can uh and that the the idea behind the lesson will actually be true and that you can just pour more um more power, more resources, more compute into them and they'll they'll just scale more naturally.</p>
</details>

Amjad Masad指出，目前为了让这些模型变得更好，需要大量的人工工作。在真正的预训练扩展时代（如GPT-2、GPT-3、GPT-3.5，可能到GPT-4），感觉只要投入更多的互联网数据，模型就会变得更好。然而现在，似乎有大量的**标注工作**（Labeling work: 指人工对数据进行分类、标记或注释，以供AI模型训练使用）和**合同工作**（Contracting work: 指通过合同雇佣外部人员或公司完成特定任务）正在进行。许多人为设计的**强化学习环境**（RL environments: Reinforcement Learning environments，指为训练AI模型而创建的模拟或真实场景，模型通过与环境互动学习最佳策略）被创建，以使LLM擅长编码并成为编码代理。OpenAI也宣布将为投资银行领域做同样的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think right now uh there's a lot of manual work going into making these models better. In the pre in the true pre-training scaling era, you know, GPT2, 3, 3.5, maybe up to four, um it it felt like you you can just uh put more internet data in there and just it just got better. uh whereas now it feels like there's a lot of labeling work happening. There's a lot of contracting work happening. A lot of these uh contrived RL environments are getting created in order to make uh LLMs good at coding and becoming coding agents and they're going to go do that. I think the news from OpenAI that they're going to do that for for investment banking.</p>
</details>

Amjad Masad试图创造一个术语——“**功能性AGI**”（Functional AGI），其理念是，通过收集尽可能多的数据并创建这些强化学习环境，可以自动化许多工作中的大量方面。这需要巨大的努力、资金和数据。他同意Adam D'Angelo的观点，即未来3到6个月内情况会好转100%，例如Claude 4.5是一个巨大的飞跃，其进步程度可能未被充分认识。因此，进步是存在的，我们将继续看到进步。但他不认为LLM正走向AGI。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I uh try to coin this term I call functional AGI which is the idea that you can automate a lot of aspects of a lot of jobs by just going in and like collecting as much data and creating these RL environments. It's going to take enormous effort and money and data and all of that in order to do and I think we're yeah I I I agree with Adam that you know things are going to get better uh 100% over the next 3 months 6 months cloud 4.5 was a huge jump uh I don't think it's appreciated how much of a jump it was over over four there's really really amazing things about cloud 4.5 so there is progress we're going to continue to see progress I don't think LM as they can understand are on on the way to AGI.</p>
</details>

Amjad Masad对AGI的定义是，一台机器能够进入任何环境并像人类一样高效学习。例如，你可以让一个人玩台球，两小时内他们就能学会击球。而目前，机器无法即时学习这样的技能。一切都需要大量的数据、计算、时间和精力，更重要的是，它需要人类专业知识，这与“非**比特教训**”（Non-bitter lesson: 指某些知识无法通过简单的数据和计算规模化获得，需要人类的独特经验和洞察力）的理念相符，即人类专业知识是不可扩展的，而我们今天正处于一个依赖人类专业知识的时代。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And my definition for AGI is I think the old school RL definition, which is um a machine that can go into any environment and learn efficiently in the same way that a human could go into uh you can put a put a human into a a a pool game and you know within 2 hours they can like shoot pool and be able to do it. Uh right now there's no way for us to have machines learn skills like that on the fly. You know everything requires enormous amount of data and compute and time and effort and and and and uh and more importantly it requires human expertise which is the non bitter lesson uh idea which is you know uh human expertise is not scalable and we are relying today we are in a human expertise regime.</p>
</details>

Adam D'Angelo承认，人类在新的环境中从有限数据中学习新技能方面确实比当前模型更出色。但另一方面，人类智能是进化的产物，这本身就使用了大量的有效计算。因此，这是一种不同类型的智能。由于它没有大规模的进化等效物，只有预训练，而预训练效果不如进化，所以它需要更多数据来学习每项新技能。但他认为，从功能性结果来看，例如就业格局何时改变、经济增长何时到来，这更多取决于我们何时能生产出与人类智能一样好的东西。即使这需要更多的计算、更多的能源和更多的训练数据，我们也可以投入所有这些能量，仍然能得到与普通人做典型工作一样好的软件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I mean I I think that humans are certainly better at learning a new skill from a limited amount of data in a new environment than the current models are. I think that on the other hand, human intelligence is the product of evolution which used a massive amount of effective computation. And so this is a different this is a different kind of intelligence. And so because it didn't have this this massive equivalent of evolution, it just has pre-training for for that which is not as good. You then need more data to learn everything, every new skill. But I guess I think in terms of like the functional consequence. So like if if you're like when when will the world when will the job landscape change? When will the e economic growth hit? I think that's going to be more a function of when we can produce something that is as good as human intelligence. Even if it takes a lot more compute, a lot more energy, a lot more training data, we could just put in all that energy and still get to software that's as good as the average person at doing a typical job.</p>
</details>

Amjad Masad对此表示同意，认为我们确实处于一种“**蛮力**”（Brute force: 指通过穷举所有可能性来解决问题的方法，通常需要大量计算资源）的模式，但这也许是可以接受的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I don't disagree with that and and that's it is it feels like we're in a brute force type of regime, but but maybe that's fine. And yeah. Yeah.</p>
</details>

所以，分歧在哪里？Amjad Masad认为，除非我们破解智能的真正本质，理解并拥有并非蛮力算法，否则我们不会达到**奇点**（Singularity: 指人工智能发展到超越人类智能的临界点，可能导致社会发生不可预测的剧变），也不会进入人类文明的下一个阶段。他认为这需要很长时间才能实现。他对此持不可知论，但感觉LLM在某种程度上分散了注意力，因为所有人才都涌向了LLM领域，导致从事智能基础研究的人才减少。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, where's the disagreement then, I guess? So, there's agreement on that. Where is the deer? I I don't think that we'll get to the singularity or I don't think that I don't think we're going to get to the next level of human civilization uh until we um we we we crack the true nature of intelligence like until we understand and have algorithms that are actually uh not brute force and and you think those will take a long time to come? Uh I I'm sort of agnostic on on that. It just does it does feel like the LMS uh in a way are distracting from that because um all the talent is going there um and therefore there's less talent that are trying to do basic research on on intelligence.</p>
</details>

Adam D'Angelo指出，与此同时，大量原本不会进入AI领域的人才现在正投身于AI研究。因此，我们拥有一个庞大的产业、大量的资金，这些资金不仅用于计算，也用于雇佣人类员工。他认为，没有什么根本性的难题是世界上最聪明的人在未来五年内努力工作无法解决的。但基础研究是不同的，它试图深入探究基本原理，而不是像工业研究那样，只关注如何让这些技术更有用以产生利润。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mhm. Yeah. At the same time a huge portion of talent is going into AI research that used to previously wouldn't have gone into AI at all. Mhm. And so you have this this massive industry, massive funding, you know, funding compute but also funding human employees. And that is I guess I nothing seems fundamentally so hard that it couldn't be solved by the smartest people in the world working incredibly hard for the next 5 years on it. But but basic research is is different, right? like trying to um like trying to get into the fundamentals and as opposed to like there's a lot of industry research like how do we make these things more useful uh in order to generate profit and um so I I think that's that's different and often I mean Thomas [ __ ] this philosopher of science talks a lot about how these research programs end up you know becoming like a bubble and like sucking all the attention and ideas and like think think about physics and how there are like these industry of a string theory and like it pulls everything in and there's sort of a plug black hole of progress and you know</p>
</details>

Adam D'Angelo提到，托马斯·库恩（Thomas Kuhn）这位科学哲学家曾说过，你必须等到当前的人退休，才有机会改变**范式**（Paradigm: 指特定科学领域中被普遍接受的理论、方法和实践框架）。他对此非常悲观。但Adam D'Angelo认为，当前的范式相当不错，我们远未达到持续推进它的**边际收益递减**（Diminishing returns: 指在投入增加时，产出增长速度逐渐放缓的现象）的阶段。他相信，我们可以在当前范式内不断进行创新，以实现目标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. No, and I think I think one of his things was like you got to wait until the current people retire even have a chance at changing the paradigm. He's very pessimistic about paradigms. But I I guess I feel like the current paradigm, this is maybe our disagree, I think the current paradigm is pretty good and I think we're nowhere near the sort of like diminishing returns of continuing to push on it. Mhm. And I bet Yeah, I guess I would just bet that you can keep doing different innovations within the paradigm to to get there.</p>
</details>

### AI对经济与就业的深远影响

假设我们继续采用蛮力方法，并自动化大量劳动力，你估计GDP（国内生产总值）每年会增长4-5%，还是会达到10%以上？它会对经济产生什么影响？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So let let's say we continue to brute force it. um we're able to automate a bunch of labor. Do you estimate that GDP is is something you know four or five percent a year or are we going up to 10% plus or what does it do to the economy?</p>
</details>

Adam D'Angelo认为，这很大程度上取决于我们能达到何种程度以及AGI的具体含义。假设有一个LLM，以每小时1美元的能源成本，可以完成任何人类的工作。在这种情况下，GDP增长将远超4-5%。问题在于，我们可能无法达到那个阶段。LLM可能能够完成人类80%的工作，但成本高于人类，或者仍有20%的工作无法完成。他相信我们最终会达到那个目标，但这可能需要5、10、15年。在此之前，我们可能会在LLM仍无法完成的事情上，或者在建造足够的发电厂以供应能源，或者在供应链中的其他瓶颈上受阻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it it depends a lot on exactly where we get to and what what AGI means. But so so let's say you have let's say you have LLM that with with an amount of energy that costs $1 an hour, they could do a job of any human. Let's just just just take that as a as a theoretical point you could get to. I think you're going to get to much more than four to 5% GDP growth in that world. I think the issue is you may not get there. So it may be that the LMS that can do everything a human can do actually cost more than humans do currently or they can do kind of like 80% of what humans can do and then there's this other 20%. Um and and I I think I do think at some point you get to also like I I don't see a reason why we don't eventually get there. That may take five, 10, 15 years. But I think until you get there, we're going to get bottlenecked on the things that the LM still can't do or the, you know, building enough power plants to to supply the energy or other bottlenecks in in the supply chain.</p>
</details>

Amjad Masad担心LLM对经济可能产生有害影响，例如，LLM有效地自动化了入门级工作，但未能自动化专家级工作。以**质量保证**（QA: Quality Assurance，确保产品或服务满足特定质量标准的过程）为例，AI在QA方面表现出色，但仍无法处理所有长尾事件。因此，现在许多优秀的QA人员管理着数百个AI代理，这大大提高了生产力，但公司不再招聘新人，因为AI代理比新人更出色。他认为这是一种奇怪的平衡状态，很多人没有考虑到这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One thing I worry about uh is uh the delotterious effect of LMS in the economy in that say LM's uh you know effectively automate uh the entry level job but not but but but the but not the expert's job right so um let's take uh you know QA Q quality assurance um And uh it it's it's so good, but uh there's still all these longtail event uh you know events that it doesn't handle. And so you have a lot of uh really good QA people now like managing like hundreds of agents and you effectively increase productivity a lot. Uh but they're not hiring new people because the agents are better than new people. Uh and and and that that feels like a weird equilibrium to be in, right? And I don't think that many people are thinking about it.</p>
</details>

Adam D'Angelo表示同意，这确实正在发生，例如计算机科学专业的大学毕业生，工作岗位不如以前多。LLM在一定程度上可以替代他们以前会做的工作，这无疑是造成这种现象的原因之一。这意味着未来进入这个行业的人会减少，而公司过去曾投入大量资金雇佣和培训他们。他认为这是一个真正的问题，但这个问题也会创造经济激励来解决它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. For sure. Yeah. No, I I I think that's, you know, I think it's happening with um CS majors graduating from college, there's just not as many jobs as there used to be. And and um LLMs are a little more substitutable for what they previously would have done. And I'm I'm sure that's contributing to it. And then it means that you're going to have fewer people going up that ramp that, you know, companies paid a lot of money to to employ them and and and train them. Um and so I I think it's a real problem. I think it's going to I'm guessing you'll probably see some kind of like that problem also creates a economic incentive to solve the problem.</p>
</details>

Adam D'Angelo认为，这可能会为那些能够培训人才的公司创造更多机会，或者利用AI来教授人们这些技能。但目前这确实是一个问题。另一个相关问题是，由于我们依赖专家数据来训练LLM，而LLM开始替代这些工人，那么在某个时候，当所有专家都失业并被LLM取代时，如果LLM真的依赖于标注数据和专家强化学习环境，它们将如何在此基础上进一步改进？他认为这是一个经济学家需要认真思考的问题，即一旦实现了第一阶段的自动化，就会面临一些挑战，那么如何进入下一个阶段？他认为这很大程度上取决于能够创建多好的强化学习环境。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it may be that there's like more opportunities for companies that can train people or maybe use of AI to to teach people these things. Um but for sure that's that's an issue right now. Another related problem is that uh since we're dependent on uh expert data in order to train the LLMs and the LM start to substitute um those workers but but but you know at some point there's no more experts because they're all out of jobs and and and and they're equivalent to the LLMs. If the LMS is truly dependent on on labeling data, expert RL environments, then how would they improve beyond that? I think that's something question for an economist to really sit down and think about is like once you get the first tick of automation, I mean there there are some challenges there. And so how do you go how do you go how do you go to the next part? Yeah, I mean I I think it a lot of it is going to depend on how good of RL environments can be created.</p>
</details>

Adam D'Angelo举例说，极端情况下，像**AlphaGo**（AlphaGo: 谷歌DeepMind开发的人工智能围棋程序，通过强化学习超越人类顶尖棋手）这样的完美环境，AI可以轻松超越专家水平。但许多工作的数据是有限的，任何人都可以从中训练。因此，研究工作如何克服这一瓶颈将非常有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you know, in the one extreme you have something like Alph Go where just a perfect environment and you can just blast past expert level. Um, but I think a lot of jobs have limited data that anyone can can train from. And so I think it'll be interesting to see how how easy is it for research efforts to to overcome that that bottleneck.</p>

### AI时代的新兴职业：AI赋能者与创意工作

如果让你猜测未来哪些职业类别会涌现或爆发，有些人可能会说每个人都是**网红**（Influencer），或者从事某种护理领域的工作，或者每个人都受雇于政府，成为某种官僚，或者以某种方式训练AI。随着越来越多的事情被自动化，你认为越来越多的人会开始做什么？例如，从事艺术和诗歌创作？

<p class="english-text">If you had to make a guess on what job category is going to be introduced or explode in in the future um you know some people say it's like the you know everyone's an influencer you know or in some sort of caring um field or um you know everyone's employed by the government and some sort of bureaucrat thing or um you know maybe training the AI in in some way uh you know as as more and more things start to get automated you know what is your your guess as to what more and more people start to you know, doing art and poetry is</p>
</details>

Adam D'Angelo认为，在某个时候，当所有事情都自动化后，人们会从事艺术和诗歌创作。他举例说，自从计算机在国际象棋方面超越人类后，下国际象棋的人数反而增加了。所以，如果人们都能自由地追求自己的爱好，只要有某种财富分配方式让人们能够负担生活，他认为这不是一个糟糕的世界。但在短期内，这还有很长一段路要走，至少在未来十年内。

<p class="english-text">at some point you have everything automated and then I think people will do art and poetry and you know there's a data point that the people playing chess is up since computers got better at human than than humans at chess. So I don't think that's a bad world if people are all just kind of free to to pursue their their hobbies. uh as long as you have some kind of you know way to distribute wealth so that so people can afford to to live. Um but I you know in the near that that's a while away and in the near term well like 10 15 years out I I don't know how much but yeah in the in the I'll put it in the at least 10 years range. Um, I I think in the near term the job categories that are going to explode, the jobs that can really leverage AI and so so people who are good at using AI to to accomplish their jobs, especially to accomplish things that the AI couldn't have done by itself, there's just there's just massive demand for for that.</p>

Adam D'Angelo认为，在短期内，那些能够真正利用AI的职业类别将会爆发，即那些擅长使用AI完成工作的人，特别是完成AI本身无法完成的事情，对此将有巨大的需求。

</details>

Amjad Masad不认为我们会达到自动化所有工作的地步，至少在当前范式下不会。他甚至不确定这是否会发生。他认为，许多工作是关于服务其他人类的，你需要从根本上成为人类，才能理解其他人想要什么，你需要拥有人类的经验。因此，除非我们创造出真正的人类，除非AI真正融入人类经验，否则人类将永远是经济中思想的创造者。

<p class="english-text">I don't think we're going to get to a point where you automate every every job. Uh, definitely not in the current paradigm. I would uh I would doubt it happening. I I I'm not certain it would ever happen, but definitely not in the current paradigm. Now, here's why I think because a lot of jobs is about servicing other humans. You need to be fundamentally human in order to you need to be actually human in order to understand what other people want, you know, and so you need to have the human experience. So unless we're going to uh create uh human humans, unless the m unless AI is actually embodied in the human experience, then humans will always be the generators of ideas in the economy.</p>
</details>

Adam D'Angelo回应了Amjad Masad关于人类作用的观点。他指出，人类集体拥有大量知识，即使是单个专家，一生中积累的经验和见识，也常常包含许多未被记录下来的知识，这被称为**默会知识**（Tacit knowledge: 指难以通过语言或文字表达，主要通过经验、实践和直觉获得的知识）。他认为，人们通过分享知识，尤其是在LLM训练集中没有的知识，仍然可以发挥重要作用。至于他们是否能以此谋生，他不知道。但如果这成为瓶颈，那么所有的经济压力都会转向这个领域。

<p class="english-text">Adam, respond to Andre's point around the human part because you created one of the most, you know, the best wisdom of the crowds, you know, uh platforms in in the universe. Um and now you've gone, you know, all all in with Po. Um what are your thoughts on you know to what extent will we be relying on um humans versus will we be trusting AIs to you know be our therapists be our you know caretakers in other ways. Humans have a lot of knowledge collectively and you know even like one individual person who's an expert and has lived a whole life and had a whole career and seen a lot of things they they often know a lot of things that are not written down anywhere tacet knowledge and um you call it tested knowledge but also also what they're capable of writing down if you did ask them a question I think there's still an important role for for people to play in the by sharing their knowledge, especially when they have knowledge that that just wasn't otherwise in an LLM's training set. Um, you know, whether they will be able to make a full-time living doing that, I I don't know. But if that becomes a bottleneck, then then for sure that's going to mean that all the sort of like economic pressure goes goes to that.</p>
</details>

Adam D'Angelo质疑“必须是人类才能知道人类想要什么”的说法。他举例说，**推荐系统**（Recommender systems: 利用算法分析用户行为和偏好，向用户推荐可能感兴趣的商品、内容或服务的系统），例如Facebook、Instagram或Quora的推荐系统，在预测你感兴趣的内容方面已经超越了人类。无论你多么了解他，都无法与这些算法竞争，因为它们拥有关于他点击过的所有内容、其他人点击过的所有内容以及这些数据集之间所有相似之处的大量数据。他承认，作为人类，你可以模拟人类行为，这使得测试想法更容易，作曲家和艺术家在创作过程中也会这样做，或者厨师会烹饪并品尝。但与AI可以训练的数据量相比，他们拥有的数据非常少。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't in terms of the like you know you have to be human to know what humans want. I don't know about that. So like as an example I think I think recommener systems the system that ranks your Facebook or Instagram or Kora feed those recommener systems are already superhuman at predicting what you're going to be interested in in reading. Like if if if I gave you a task that was like make me a feed that I'm going to read, like there there's just no way. No matter how much you knew about me, there's no way you could compete with these algorithms that just have so much data about everything I've ever clicked on, everything everyone else has ever clicked on, what all the similarities are between all those those different data sets. And so I don't know, you know, it's true that as a human you can kind of like simulate being a human and that makes it easier for you to like test out ideas. And I'm sure that composers and artists are this is an important part of their their process for doing work is they or chefs or Yeah. Yeah. They they produce something and you know a chef will cook something and they taste it and it's important that they can taste it but I don't know you know they they just they have very little data compared to what AI can be trained on. So So I I don't know how that's going to shake out.</p>
</details>

Amjad Masad认为这是一个好观点，推荐系统最终是在聚合所有不同的品味，然后找到你在多维品味向量空间中的位置，并为你提供最好的内容。他觉得这比我们想象的要狭窄，虽然在推荐系统中确实如此，但他不确定这是否适用于所有领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's a that's a good point. I mean ultimately what recommended systems uh are they're like aggregating all the different tastes and then sort of finding where you sit in the sort of multi-dimensional taste vector space and like getting you the best content there. So I guess there's some of that. I think that's more narrow than we think like like yes it it's true in recommener systems but I'm not entirely sure it's true of of of everything. Um but so I I think the best prediction for where the world is headed and this is not a endorsement or necessarily like this is where I think the world's headed because I think part of it is uh will be slightly in uh instable unstable system but I think the sovereign individual continues to be I think a really good set of predictions for the future although it's not a scientific book or not. It's a very pyic book and um but but the idea is uh you know in the late 80s early 90s um are they economists? I'm not sure. I think they're economists or political science majors uh two people out of the UK um wrote this book about trying to predict what happens uh when computer technology matures, right?</p>
</details>

Amjad Masad认为，对世界未来走向的最佳预测来自《**主权个体**》（The Sovereign Individual: 一本预测数字时代社会、经济和政治变革的著作）。他认为这本书对未来做出了很好的预测，尽管它不是一本科学著作，而是一本非常具有预言性的书。其核心思想是，在80年代末90年代初，两位来自英国的经济学家或政治学家试图预测计算机技术成熟后会发生什么。他们认为，人类经历了农业革命和工业革命，现在正在经历另一场革命——信息革命，现在我们称之为智能革命，但未来的人们会给它命名。他们试图预测接下来会发生什么，得出的结论是，最终将有大量人口可能失业或在经济上不再有贡献。但**创业资本家**（Entrepreneur capitalists: 结合创业精神和资本运作能力，通过创新和投资推动经济发展的人）将获得极高的杠杆，因为他们可以利用AI代理非常迅速地创建公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They're like, you know, humanity went through the agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution. We're going through another revolution. Uh clearly, uh information revolution, now we call it intelligence revolution, whatever. I think we will not be able to call it something. It's a future people will call it something, but we are going through something. And so they're trying to predict, okay, what happens from here? And what they arrive at is that the um ultimately you're going to have large swaths of people that are potentially unemployed or economically not um contributing, but you're going to have the entrepreneur the entrepreneur capitalists going to be so highly leveraged because they can spin up these companies with AI agents very quickly.</p>
</details>

Amjad Masad解释说，这些创业者之所以能获得高杠杆，是因为他们具有很强的生成能力，拥有关于其他人想要什么的有趣想法。他们是人类，可以非常迅速地创建公司、产品和服务，并以特定方式组织经济。政治也将随之改变，因为今天的政治是基于每个人都在经济上有所贡献的理念。但当大规模自动化出现，只有少数创业者和非常智能的生成型人才能够真正发挥生产力时，政治结构也会随之改变。他们谈到**民族国家**（Nation state: 以民族为基础形成的国家，通常具有共同的文化、语言和历史）将逐渐衰落，取而代之的是国家之间争夺富裕人口的时代。作为“主权个体”，你可以与你喜欢的国家协商税率。这听起来有点像生物学，他认为这与未来发展方向不远。当人类不再是经济生产力的单位时，包括文化和政治在内的一切都必须改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, because they have this because they're very generative. They have interesting ideas. They're human. They've uh they have interesting ideas about what other people want. They can create these companies very quickly in these products and services and they can organize the economy in certain ways. And the politics will change because uh to you know today's politics is based on um every human being uh economically productive. Uh but when you have only uh when you have massive automation and then you have a few entrepreneurs and very intelligent generative people are actually uh able to be productive then the political structures also change. Um uh and so they talk about how the you know nation state sort of subsides and instead you go back to uh to an era where um states are like competing over people over wealthy people and like they you know uh as a sovereign individual you can like uh negotiate your tax rate with your favorite state and so it starts to sound like biology a little bit and I don't think it is far from where I where it might be headed. Now again, it's it's not a sort of a value judgment or or desire. Uh but but I do think it's worth thinking about when when people are not the the you know unit of economic productivity, things have to change, including culture and and politics.</p>
</details>

Adam D'Angelo认为，关于那本书以及更广泛的讨论，有一个问题是，一项技术何时会奖励“防御者”，何时会奖励“聚合者”？或者说，它何时会激励更多的**去中心化**（Decentralization: 权力、控制或功能从中心实体分散到多个参与者的系统）而非**中心化**（Centralization: 权力、控制或功能集中于一个中心实体的系统）？他提到Peter Thiel十年前曾说过，加密货币是自由主义的，更具去中心化，而AI是共产主义的，更具中心化。他认为这种说法并非完全准确。AI似乎确实赋能了许多个体，但加密货币最终也像金融科技一样，或者它确实赋能了民族国家。因此，关于哪种技术能更多地赋能“边缘”或“中心”，这是一个开放的问题。如果它赋能“边缘”，那么“主权个体”的理念似乎是成立的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I I think there's a question with that book and in some of this conversation more broadly of like when does a technology reward the uh you know the defender versus this the sort of aggregator or something or like the um when does it incentivize more decentralization versus centraliz like uh remember Peter Tiel had this quip a decade ago of like you know crypto is libertarian is more decentralizing AI is you know communist or more centralizing and it it um it's not obvious to me that that that that's entirely accurate. um on on either side AI does seem to empower a bunch of individuals as you were saying and then also you know crypto turns out is like fintech or it's like stable you know uh it does empower sort of uh you know in nation states we're talking about doing the sort of like you know the the China thing that they were going to do so yeah I think there's an open question as to you know which technology leads to who does it empower more the edges or the the center and I think if it empowers the edges it seems like the sovereign individual is is and and maybe there's a barbell uh where it's like both basically the big the incumbents just get much much much much bigger and there's like these edges but anyways that's</p>
</details>

Adam D'Angelo对这项技术将赋能的独立创业者数量感到非常兴奋。他认为它极大地增加了个人所能做的事情，许多想法从未被探索，因为组建团队、筹集资金并找到具备各种技能的合适人才需要大量工作。现在，一个人就可以将这些想法变为现实，他相信我们将看到许多令人惊叹的事情。他经常收到人们因为使用像Replit这样的工具赚了很多钱而辞职的推文，这非常令人兴奋。他认为，机会首次大规模地向所有人开放，这是这项技术最令人兴奋的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm I'm very excited for the um the number of solo entrepreneurs that this technology is going to enable. I think it's it's just greatly it's vastly increased what what a single person can do and there's so many ideas that just never got explored because it's a lot of work to get a team of people together and maybe raise the funding for it and get the right kind of people with all the different skills you need. Um and now that one person can can bring these things into existence, I I think I think we're going to see a lot of really amazing stuff. Yeah, I get these tweets all the time about people who like quit their jobs because they started making so much money. You're using tools like like rapid and um it's it's really exciting. I think uh if for the first time opportunity is massively available for for everyone uh and I think that that is to me the most exciting thing about this technology other than all the other stuff that we're talking about just the ability for more people to be able to become entrepreneurs is yeah it's massive</p>

### 颠覆式创新与既有巨头的应对

这种趋势在未来一二十年内显然会发生。你认为AI更可能带来**维持性创新**（Sustaining innovation: 指在现有产品或服务基础上进行改进，以满足现有市场需求）还是**颠覆性创新**（Disruptive innovation: 指引入全新的产品或服务，最初可能性能较差或成本较高，但最终会颠覆现有市场）？你认为大部分价值将由OpenAI出现之前就已经规模化的公司获取，还是由2015-2016年之后成立的公司获取？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that that trend is obviously going to happen as we look out of the next decade or two do you think that AI is more likely to be sustaining or disruptive in the Christian sense to ask it another Okay. Do you think that most of the value capture is going to come from companies that were scaled pre OpenAI starting? Um uh so is so replet still counts as the the latter and so does court to some degree or or do um do you think most of the value is going to be captured by companies that started you know after let's say 2015 2016? So there's a related question which is how much of the value is going to go to the hyperscalers versus everyone else and I think on that one we are I actually think we're in a pretty good balance where there's enough competition among the hyperscalers that the um there's enough competition that as an application level company you have choice and you have alternatives and the the prices are coming down incredibly quickly. Um, but there's also not so much competition that the hyperscalers and the you know labs like Anthropic and OpenAI, there's not so much competition that they are unable to raise money and make these long-term investments. And so I actually think we're in a in a pretty good balance and and we're going to have a lot of a lot of new companies and a lot of growth among the the hyperscalers.</p>
</details>

Adam D'Angelo认为，关于价值将流向**超大规模公司**（Hyperscalers: 指提供大规模云计算服务和基础设施的公司，如AWS、Azure、Google Cloud）还是其他公司，我们正处于一个相当好的平衡状态。超大规模公司之间存在足够的竞争，使得应用层公司有选择和替代方案，价格也在迅速下降。但竞争又没有激烈到让超大规模公司和像Anthropic、OpenAI这样的实验室无法筹集资金并进行长期投资。因此，他认为我们正处于一个相当好的平衡状态，将会有许多新公司出现，超大规模公司也将实现大量增长。

</details>

Amjad Masad认为Adam D'Angelo的看法大致正确。他解释说，“维持性”与“颠覆性”的术语来自《**创新者的窘境**》（The Innovator's Dilemma: 克莱顿·克里斯坦森的著作，探讨成熟企业如何被新兴技术颠覆）。其核心思想是，每当出现新的技术趋势时，都会有一个“**幂律曲线**”（Power curve: 指一种现象，其中少数实体占据了大部分资源或影响力，而大多数实体只占很小一部分）。新技术最初可能像个玩具，或者只能抓住市场的低端。但随着它的发展，它会沿着幂律曲线向上移动，最终颠覆甚至既有企业。最初，既有企业不关注它，因为它看起来像个玩具，但最终它会颠覆一切，吞噬整个市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that's that's about right. So the terminology of sustaining versus disruptive comes from uh uh the innovator's dilemma. Uh and uh it's it's this idea that uh whenever there's a new technology trend, it sort of there's this idea of a power curve. It starts as a toy almost or something that doesn't really work or captures the lower end of the market. But as it sort of evolves, uh it goes up the power curve and eventually disrupts even the incumbents. So originally the encompass don't pay attention to it uh because it looks like a toy and then eventually disrupts everything and eats the entire uh sort of market.</p>
</details>

Amjad Masad举例说，个人电脑（PC）的出现就是如此。当PC问世时，大型**大型机**（Mainframe: 早期大型计算机系统，通常用于企业和政府的大规模数据处理）制造商并未关注它，最初认为它只是给孩子玩的。但现在，甚至数据中心都在运行在PC上。因此，PC是一种巨大的颠覆性力量。然而，也有一些技术出现后，只让既有企业受益，而对新玩家和初创公司没有太大帮助。Amjad Masad认为Adam D'Angelo说得对，AI是两者兼而有之。这可能是第一次出现如此巨大的技术趋势，既能明显地为既有企业、超大规模公司和大型互联网公司带来巨大优势，又能催生出可能与现有模式对立的新商业模式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh and so that that was true of PCs. You know, when PCs came along, the big main mainframe manufacturers did not uh uh pay attention to it and and initially it was like yeah, it's for it's, you know, for kids or whatever. Uh but we we have to run these large computers or data centers or whatever, but now even data centers are running on PCs and so on. Um and and so PCs were just a hugely disruptive uh force. Uh but there are technologies that come along and really benefit the incumbents and really don't really benefit the uh the uh new players, the startups. Uh I think Adam's right. It's uh it's both. Um and maybe for the first time it's kind of both like a a huge technology trend cuz the internet was hugely disruptive. Um but but this time uh it feels like it is an obvious supercharge for the incumbents for the hyperscalers for the large uh internet companies but it also enables uh new business models that uh that is perhaps counterposition against the uh the existing existing ones.</p>
</details>

Amjad Masad指出，大家可能都读过《创新者的窘境》这本书，并学会了如何避免被颠覆。例如，ChatGPT从根本上与Google形成了**对立定位**（Counterposition: 指通过采取与竞争对手相反的策略来获得竞争优势），因为Google的业务运作良好。ChatGPT被视为一种会产生大量幻觉和错误信息的技术，而Google希望被信任。因此，Google内部有聊天机器人，但直到ChatGPT发布两年后才发布Gemini，而ChatGPT已经赢得了品牌认知度。所以，OpenAI在某种程度上以颠覆性技术出现，但现在Google也意识到其颠覆性并做出了回应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Al although the the you know I think what happened is everyone read that book and everyone learned how to not be disrupted. Uh for example Chad GPT was fundamentally counterposition against Google because uh Google had a business that that was actually working. Uh Chad GPT was seen as this uh technology that hallucinates a lot and creates a lot of bad information and Google wanted to be trusted and so Google had chatb internally. they didn't release Gemini until like two years after Chachup and Chachup had sort of already won the like at least brand recognition. Um and and so there there was in a way open AI came out as a disruptive technology uh but but now Google realizes it's a disruptive technology and kind of responds to it.</p>
</details>

Amjad Masad认为，与此同时，AI显然也会让Google受益。至少，其搜索概览功能已经大大改进，所有Workspace套件也因Gemini而变得更好，手机等一切都变得更好。所以，AI似乎是两者兼而有之。Adam D'Angelo非常同意，每个人都读过那本书，这甚至改变了理论的含义，因为所有公开市场的投资者都读过那本书，他们现在会惩罚不适应的公司，并奖励适应的公司，即使这意味着他们必须进行长期投资。他认为，所有公司的管理层和领导层都读过这本书，他们都处于最佳状态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At the same time it was always obvious that AI is going to benefit Google at minimum. It's uh you know overview uh search overview has gotten a lot better. um all its uh you know workspace suite is is getting a lot better with Gemini. Uh their mobile phones, everything gets better. So it's it seems like it's it's both. Yeah, I I really agree. Like everyone read the book and and that changes what the theory even means because you have you've like all the all the public market investors have read that book and they now are going to punish companies for not adapting and reward them for adapting even if it means they have to make long-term investments. I think, you know, all the the management leadership of the companies have have read the book and they're on top of their game.</p>
</details>

Adam D'Angelo认为，运营这些公司的人也比那本书所基于的上一代公司的人更聪明，他们处于最佳状态，其中许多公司由创始人控制，因此他们更容易承受打击并进行这些投资。他认为，如果是在90年代那样的环境，这实际上会更具颠覆性，而不是现在这种高度竞争的世界。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think also just like the people running these companies are in I I guess I would say smarter I think than like the the companies from the generation that that book was sort of built on. and they're they're on at the top of their game and they are a lot of them are founder controlled and so they can make it's it's easier for them to sort of take a hit and and make these these investments. So that's I actually, you know, I think if if you had an environment more like we had in say like the '90s, I think this would actually be more disruptive than than the the current hyper hyper competitive uh world that we're in now.</p>
</details>

Amjad Masad反思了公司过去几年犯的一个错误，即因为公司不是市场领导者或品类赢家而放弃投资。他们从Web 2.0时代吸取教训，认为必须投资于品类赢家，价值会随着时间积累。因此，如果第一个**基础模型**（Foundation model: 指在大量数据上预训练的超大型AI模型，可适应广泛的下游任务）公司已经领先，为什么还要做下一个呢？但现在市场似乎变得如此之大，以至于在基础模型和应用领域都有多个赢家，它们正在瓜分市场中所有具有风险投资规模的部分。他好奇这是否是一种持久现象，但似乎与Web 2.0时代的一个不同之处在于，更多类别中出现了更多赢家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One mistake that we as a firm have reflected on over the past few years, though of course I haven't been here for more than just a few months, is this idea of we've that we've passed on companies because we they weren't going to be the market leader or the or the category winner. And thus we thought, oh, you know, learning the lessons from from web 2, you have to invest in the in the category winner. That's where things are going to consolidate. Value is going to acrew over time. And um it seems so you why do the the next foundation model company if the first one already has a has a head start. Um but it seems like the market has gotten so much bigger that in foundation models but also in applications there's just multiple winners and they're kind of you know fragmenting you know and taking parts of the market that are all venture scale. I'm curious if this is a durable phenomenon or but um it that seems just one difference than than the web two era is just more winners um across more categories.</p>
</details>

Adam D'Angelo认为，**网络效应**（Network effects: 指产品或服务的价值随着用户数量的增加而增加的现象）现在发挥的作用远小于Web 2.0时代，这使得竞争对手更容易起步。尽管仍然存在规模优势，因为用户越多，就能获得更多数据，也能筹集更多资金。但这种优势并不会让小规模竞争对手完全不可能生存。它只是让竞争变得困难，但肯定有空间容纳比以前更多的赢家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think network effects are playing much less of a role now than they did in the web 2 era also and that that makes it easier for competitors to get started. There's still a scale advantage because you know if you have more users you can get more data. If you have more users, you can raise more capital. But that advantage is not it doesn't make it absolutely impossible for a competitor of smaller scale. It makes it hard, but it's there there's definitely like room for more winners than than there was before.</p>
</details>

Adam D'Angelo认为另一个不同之处在于，人们强烈感受到AI的价值，愿意在早期就付费，这与Web 2.0公司面临的“如何赚钱”的问题不同。像Facebook、Google等早期公司，人们会问它们如何变现。而现在的公司，包括Adam D'Angelo和Amjad Masad的公司，从一开始就在变现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I think another difference is that people are seeing the value um so strongly that they're willing to pay um early on in maybe a way that they the question with web two companies was how are they going to make money you know you were Facebook super early obviously you know Google etc was like oh how are they going to monetize and you know the companies here are monetizing from from the get-go you know your guys' companies included</p>
</details>

Adam D'Angelo补充说，早期公司的变现方式在某种程度上取决于规模。例如，你必须拥有数百万甚至数千万用户才能建立一个良好的广告业务。而现在，通过订阅模式，你可以立即收费，这要归功于Stripe等工具使其变得更容易。这使得新进入者更容易进入市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah yeah and the I I think with the earlier generation of companies the monetization kind of depended on scale. Like you couldn't build a good ad business until you got to millions, tens of millions of users. And now with subscriptions, you can just charge right away, I think, especially thanks to things like Stripe that are making it easier. Um, and so that that that's also made it a lot more friendly to to new entrance.</p>
</details>

Adam D'Angelo还提到了地缘政治问题。他认为我们显然不再处于全球化时代，情况可能会变得更糟。因此，投资欧洲的OpenAI或基础模型公司可能是一个好主意，同样，中国也是一个完全不同的世界。所以，地缘政治方面也很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's there's also uh questions of geopolitics like you know it seems clear that we're not uh in this um globalized era and perhaps it's going to get much worse and so investing in the foundation in the open AI of of Europe might be a good idea and like similarly China being an entirely different different world and so there's um sort of a geo aspect of it that interesting</p>
</details>

突然之间，我们对地缘政治的痴迷变得有用了。Adam D'Angelo，你之前谈到人类知识，你认为Po在某种意义上是在颠覆你自己吗？或者谈谈你对Po的押注以及其演变过程。

### Quora与Po： leveraging人类知识和模型多样性

Adam D'Angelo认为，他们将**Po**（Po: Quora推出的一个平台，允许用户与各种AI模型进行聊天和互动）更多地视为一个额外的机会，而非对**Quora**（Quora: 一个问答网站，用户可以提出问题、回答问题并编辑内容）的颠覆。他们之所以开发Po，是因为在2022年初，他们开始尝试使用GPT-3为Quora生成答案，并将其与人类答案进行比较。他们意识到GPT-3的答案不如人类，但独特之处在于你可以立即获得任何你想问的问题的答案。他们还意识到，这些答案不需要公开，用户更倾向于私下获取。因此，他们觉得这是一个让人们私下与AI聊天的全新机会。

<p class="english-text">You know, I I think we saw Po more as just an additional opportunity than than as disruption to to Kora. Um the the way we got to it was we in early 2022 we started experimenting with using GBD3 to generate answers for Kora and and we compared them to the the human answers and sort of realized that they weren't as good but what was really unique was that you could instantly get an answer to anything you wanted to ask about and we realized it didn't need to be in public. It actually was your preference would be to to have it be in private and so we felt like there was just a new opportunity here to to let people chat with with AI and in private.</p>
</details>

Adam D'Angelo表示，这也是对模型公司多样性的一种押注，这种多样性需要一段时间才能显现。但他认为现在我们正达到一个有很多模型的阶段，尤其是在跨模态（如图像模型、视频模型、音频模型）方面，有很多公司。特别是推理研究模型正在分化，代理（Agents）也开始成为多样性的来源。因此，他们很幸运能进入这样一个世界，有足够的多样性使得一个通用的接口聚合器变得有意义。

<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. So it was also a bet on diversity of of model companies which took a while to play out. But I think now we're we're getting to the point where there's there's a lot of models. There's a lot of companies especially when you go across modalities. You think about image models, video models, audio models. Um especially like the reasoning research models are are sort of diverging. Agents are starting to be their own source of diversity. Um, so, so we're lucky to to now be getting into this world where there's there's sort of enough diversity for a a general interface aggregator to to make sense. Um, but yeah, it was it was a bet early on. We kind of</p>
</details>

Amjad Masad发现，令人惊讶的是，即使是非技术型消费者也会使用多个AI。他没想到会这样，因为人们通常只使用Google，很少会同时查看Google和Yahoo。但现在，你和普通人交谈，他们会说：“是的，我大部分时间都用ChatGPT，但Gemini在处理这类问题时要好得多。”这很有趣，消费者的复杂程度提高了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it's surprising actually that um even uh not particularly technical consumers actually do use multiple AIS. Uh like I didn't expect that like you know people only used Google. they never like looked at Google and then Yahoo or like very few people do it. But now you talk to just average people and they'll say, "Yeah, I use CHP most of the time, but Gemini is much better at like these types of questions." And it's like, "Oh, interesting. The sophistication of consumers have gone."</p>
</details>

Adam D'Angelo补充说，甚至有人说不同的AI有不同的个性，他们更喜欢Claude。他想回到Adam D'Angelo之前提到的一个观点，即关于“暗物质”——人们拥有的许多知识尚未被分类。这不仅仅是默会知识，而是你可以向他们提问并让他们描述的知识。人们对LLM的一个疑问是：我们已经训练了整个互联网，还有多少知识存在？是10倍还是1000倍？如果我们真的采用蛮力方法，将所有人类知识提取到数据集中，我们能从中获得多大的提升？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And even people saying that they have different personalities and they, you know, you know, sort of resonate with Claude more, you know, or whatever. the um I want to return back to this point you said earlier Adam about you're kind of talking about like dark matter about how we're going to you know brute force there's a lot of knowledge that people have that's you know sort of not um sort of categorized yet and it's not just task of knowledge it's actually knowledge that you could you know ask them about and they could describe it how you know because one question people have with LMS is like how much we've already trained the whole internet how much more knowledge is there um and so is it like 10x is it like a thousand like what is sort of the what is kind of intuitive sense of if we do brute force it and build this whole you know machine that gets all the knowledge out of humans onto sort of you know a data set that we can then you know implement how do we think about the upside from there</p>
</details>

Adam D'Angelo认为这很难量化，但一个庞大的产业正在发展，旨在将人类知识转化为AI可以使用的形式。这包括像Scale AI、Surge、Merkore这样的公司，以及大量刚刚起步的其他公司。随着智能变得越来越便宜和强大，他认为瓶颈将越来越多地集中在数据上，以及你需要什么来创造这种智能。这将导致更多此类事情发生。人们可能会通过训练AI赚更多的钱，或者更多这样的公司会成立。或者可能有其他形式。但他认为，经济将自然地重视AI无法做到的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know I think it's very hard to quantify but there's a massive industry developing around getting human knowledge into for the form where AI can use it so this is things like scale AI I Surge Merkore, but there there's a massive long tale of other companies just getting started. And as you have, you know, as intelligence gets cheaper and cheaper and more and more powerful, the bottleneck, I think, is increasingly going to be on the data and what do you need to create that intelligence? And so that's going to cause this that's going to cause more and more of this to happen. It might be that people can make more and more money by training AI. It might be that more and more of these companies get started. Um or it might be it might be that there's there's other forms of it. But I I think I think it's going to be sort of like the economy is going to naturally value whatever the AI can't do.</p>
</details>

那么，AI不能做什么的框架是什么？Adam D'Angelo认为，你可以问AI研究人员，他们可能会有更好的答案。但对他来说，就是训练集中没有的信息。这是AI本质上无法做到的事情。AI会变得非常聪明，可以进行大量推理，甚至在某个时候可以证明所有数学定理，如果它从你给定的公理开始。但如果它不知道某家公司20年前是如何解决某个问题的，如果这些信息不在训练集中，那么只有知道此事的人类才能回答这个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what is the framework for what it can't like? what has meant a model for what it can't do? I don't, you know, you could you could ask a an AI researcher, they they might have a a better answer, but to me, there's just information that's not in the training set. And that is something that's inherently going to be, you know, going to be something AI can't do. There will be, you know, the AI will get very smart. It can do a lot of reasoning. It could prove every math theorem at some point. If it starts from, you know, some axioms that you that you give it, but if it doesn't know how did this particular company solve this problem 20 years ago, if that wasn't in the training set, then only a human who who knows that is going to be able to answer that question.</p>

那么，随着时间的推移，你如何看待Quora与AI的互动，或者说如何并行运行它们？

<p class="english-text">And so over time, how do you see Kora um interfacing with or like how are you running these in parallel? How how do you think about this?</p>
</details>

Adam D'Angelo表示，Quora的重点是人类知识，让人们分享他们的知识，这些知识对其他人有帮助，也对AI学习有帮助。他们与一些AI实验室有合作关系，Quora将在这个生态系统中扮演它应有的角色，即作为人类知识的来源。同时，AI也正在让Quora变得更好。他们已经在内容审核质量、答案排名以及产品体验方面取得了重大改进。因此，通过应用AI，Quora变得更好了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah, so I mean Kora, our focus is on human knowledge and and letting people share their knowledge and and um that knowledge may be helpful for you know it's it's it's helpful for other humans and it's it's also helpful for AI to to learn from. um we have relationships with some of the AI labs um and we're going to sort of play the role core will play the role that it is meant to play in this ecosystem which is a as a a source of of human knowledge. Um at the same time AI is making core a lot better. we've been able to make uh major improvements in moderation quality and in uh in ranking answers and in uh just just improving the product experience. So uh so it's gotten a lot better by applying AI to it.</p>

### Replit的愿景：AI Agent的十年

Amjad Masad谈到了Replit的未来。他提到，**Kpathy**（Kpathy: 可能是指某位行业思想领袖，但具体身份不详，此处保留原文拼写）最近说这将是“代理的十年”，他认为这绝对正确。与之前的AI模式不同，当AI首次应用于编码时，它是通过Co-pilot实现的**自动补全**（Autocomplete: 指在用户输入时自动预测并提供建议的功能），然后通过ChatGPT实现了聊天。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And and talk talk about your future as well. Obviously you know you had this business for for a long time you know focused on developers. Because at one point you're targeting you know u nonprofit. No exactly the edtech market I believe you did two or three million in revenue reported and then you know recently techrunch I know it's outdated but I think it reported something like 150 million. I know it's since you've had this incredible growth as as you've shifted the the business model um and and the customer segment. How do you think about the the future of replet? Um I think Kpathy uh recently said that it's going to be the decade of agents. Uh and I think that's absolutely right. It's um uh as opposed to like prior modalities of AI like when uh AI first came to coding it was autocomplete with co-pilot then it became sort of chat with chat</p>
</details>

Amjad Masad认为，Cursor在**组合器模态**（Composer modality: 指一种允许用户编辑大块文件而非逐行代码的交互模式）上进行了创新。但他觉得Replit的创新在于**代理**（Agent: 指能够感知环境、自主决策并执行任务以实现目标的AI实体）。其理念不仅是编辑代码，还包括配置基础设施（如数据库）、进行迁移、连接到云端、部署、拥有完整的调试循环（如执行代码、运行测试）。因此，整个开发生命周期循环都在代理内部发生，这需要很长时间才能成熟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">then I think cursor innovated on this composer modality which is like editing like large chunks of uh files but that's it. I think replet what Replet innovated is is is is the agent um and the idea of like not only editing code, provisioning infrastructure like databases, doing migrations, um you know connecting to the cloud, deploying uh having the entire debug loop like executing the code, running tests, um and so just like the entire development life cycle loop happening inside an agent and that's going to take a long time to mature.</p>
</details>

Amjad Masad提到，Replit的Agent测试版于2024年9月发布，是第一个同时处理代码和基础设施的此类产品，但当时相当不稳定。Agent v1大约在12月发布，它需要新一代模型，例如从Claude 3.5到3.7。Claude 3.7是第一个真正知道如何使用计算机和虚拟机模型。这些事物一直在同步发展。每一代模型，我们都会发现新的能力。Agent V2在自主性方面有了很大改进。Agent V1可以运行约2分钟，Agent V2可以运行20分钟。Agent 3宣传可以运行200分钟，但实际上可以无限期运行，他们有用户运行了28小时以上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we're agent in beta came September 2024 and it was the first of its kind that did this both code and infrastructure but it was you know fairly janky didn't work very well and then agent v1 around December um it took another um uh generation of models so you go from claw 3.5 to 3.7 3.7 was the first model uh that uh really knew how to use a computer, a virtual machine. So, unsurprisingly, it was the first also computer use model. Um, and these things have been moving together. Uh, and so with every generation of models, we see we find new capabilities. And, um, you know, um, Agent V2 improved on autonomy a lot. Agent V1 could run for like 2 minutes. Agent V2, uh, uh, ran for 20 minutes. Agent 3, we advertised it as running for 200 minutes. just felt like it should be symmetrical, but like it's actually runs kind of indefinitely. Like we've had users running it for 28 plus hours. Wow.</p>
</details>

Amjad Masad表示，主要思想是如果在循环中加入一个**验证器**（Verifier: 指用于检查AI模型输出或行为是否正确、符合预期或满足特定标准的机制）。他记得Nvidia的一篇论文提到他们如何使用DeepSeek编写CUDA内核，并通过在循环中加入验证器（例如运行测试）使其运行约20分钟。他当时想，我们可以加入什么样的验证器呢？显然可以加入**单元测试**（Unit tests: 针对程序最小可测试单元进行检查，以验证其行为是否符合预期的测试），但单元测试并不能真正捕捉应用程序是否正常工作。因此，他们开始深入研究计算机使用，以及计算机使用是否能够测试应用程序。计算机使用非常昂贵，而且仍然有很多bug，正如Adam D'Angelo所说，这将是解锁许多应用的重要改进领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and the main idea there was that if we put a verify on the loop. I remember reading Deepseek uh a paper from Nvidia about how they um used Deepseek to write CUDA kernels and they were able to run Deepseek for like 20 minutes if they put a verifier in the loop like being able to run tests or something like that. And I thought oh okay so what kind of verifier can we put in the loop? Obviously, you can put unit tests, but unit test doesn't really capture whether the app is working or not. So, we started kind of digging into computer use and whether computer use was going to be able to test apps. Computer use is very expensive and um it's actually kind of still very buggy and like Adam talked about that's going to be uh a big area of improvement that'll unlock a lot of applications.</p>
</details>

Amjad Masad最终构建了自己的框架，其中包含许多技巧和一些AI研究成果，他认为Replit的计算机使用测试模型是最好的之一。一旦他们将这个框架放入循环中，就可以让Replit以高自主性运行。他们有一个自主性等级，你可以选择你的自主性级别，然后它就会编写代码，测试应用程序。如果出现bug，它会读取错误日志，然后再次编写代码，并且可以运行数小时。他们看到人们通过长时间运行它构建了令人惊叹的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But we ended up building our own framework with like bunch of hacks and some some AI research and repless computer use I think testing models. I think one of the best. Um and uh and once we put that into the loop then you can put replet in high autonomy. So we have an autonomy scale. Uh uh you can you can you can choose your autonomy level and then it just writes the code goes and tests the applications. If there's a bug it reads the error log and like writes the code again and and can go for for for hours. And we've seen people build amazing things by letting it run for for a long time.</p>
</details>

Amjad Masad表示，这需要继续改进，变得更便宜、更快。所以，运行时间更长不一定是值得骄傲的事情，它应该尽可能快。他们正在为此努力。Agent 4将会有很多新想法。其中一个重要的事情是，你不应该只等待你请求的那个功能，而应该能够处理许多不同的功能。因此，**并行代理**（Parallel agents: 指多个AI代理同时工作，以加速任务完成或处理复杂问题）的理念对他们来说非常有趣。例如，你请求一个登录页面，但你也可以请求Stripe结账和管理仪表板。AI应该能够找出如何并行处理所有这些不同的任务，或者某些任务无法并行处理，但它也应该能够合并代码。因此，实现AI代理之间的协作非常重要，这样可以大大提高单个开发者的生产力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, that needs to continue to get better. That needs to um to get cheaper and faster. Uh so, it's not necessarily a point of pride to run for a lot longer. Like, it should be as fast as possible. So, we're working on that. Um a agent for there's a bunch of ideas that are going to be uh coming out. Agent 4, but one of the big things is you shouldn't be just like waiting for that one feature that you requested. you should be able to work uh on a lot of different features. So the idea of like parallel agents is very interesting to us. So you know you ask for a login page but you could also ask for a stripe uh checkout and and then you ask for an admin dashboard. The AI should be able to figure out how to paralyze all these different tasks or some tasks are not paralyzable but should also be able to do merge across the code. So being able to do collaboration across AI agents um is very important and that way the productivity of a single developer goes up by a lot.</p>
</details>

Amjad Masad认为，目前即使你使用Claude Code或Cursor等工具，并行性也不多。但他觉得生产力的下一个提升将来自于坐在像Replit这样的编程环境中，能够管理数十个代理，也许在某个时候是数百个，但至少是5、6、7、8、9、10个代理，它们都在你产品的不同部分工作。他还认为**用户界面**（UI: User Interface，用户与软件或硬件交互的视觉和操作部分）和**用户体验**（UX: User Experience，用户在使用产品或服务时的整体感受和满意度）在改进方面还有很多工作要做。目前，你试图将你的想法转化为文本表示，就像**产品需求文档**（PRD: Product Requirements Document，详细描述产品功能、特性和用户需求的文档）一样。但产品描述很难，你会在许多科技公司看到，很难就确切的功能达成一致，因为语言是模糊的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right now even when you're using clot code or cursor and others that there isn't a lot of parallelism going on but I think the next uh boost in productivity is going to come from sitting in front of programming environment like replet and being able to manage uh tens of agents maybe at some point hundreds but you know at least you know five 6 7 8 9 10 agents uh all different all you know working in different parts of your your product. I also think that um UI and UX uh could could use a lot of work in terms of um right now um you're trying to translate your ideas uh into this like textual representation. I'm just like like a PRD, right? The what product managers do, right? Just product descriptions. But product descriptions don't it's really hard and you see it in a lot of tech companies. it's really hard to align on the exact features because it's l language is fuzzy.</p>
</details>

Amjad Masad设想了一个世界，你可以以更**多模态**（Multimodal: 指AI系统能够处理和理解多种类型的数据，如文本、图像、音频等）的方式与AI互动。例如，打开一个白板，能够与AI一起绘画和绘制图表，像与人类一样工作。然后，下一个阶段是拥有更好的记忆，不仅在项目内部，而且跨项目。也许Replit代理会有不同的实例化，例如，某个代理非常擅长Python数据科学，因为它拥有关于公司过去所有信息、技能和记忆。所以，他会有一个数据分析型的Replit代理，一个前端Replit代理，它们在多个项目、时间和互动中拥有记忆，也许它们会像员工一样出现在你的Slack中，你可以和它们交谈。他可以继续谈论一个可能跨越3到5年的路线图，但他们目前所处的代理阶段还有很多工作要做，而且会非常有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I think there's a there's a world in which you're interacting with AI in a more multimodal fashion. So open up uh like a whiteboard and being able to draw and like diagram with AI and and and really work with it like you work with a human. Uh and then um then the next stage of that uh having uh like better memory better memory inside the project but also across project and perhaps having different instantiations of replet agent that uh you know that this this agent is really good at like um Python data science because um you know it has all the information and skills and memories of about my company what it's done in the past. So I'll have a data analysis like sort of rapid agent and I'll have like a front-end replet agent and they have memory over multiple projects and over time and over interactions and maybe they sit in your Slack like a like a worker and you can like talk to them. So again like I can I can keep going for another 15 minutes about a road map that could span like 3 to four to 5 years perhaps. and but but this this agent this agent phase that we're in is just there's so much work to do and it's it's it's going to be a lot of fun.</p>

### AI时代的文化与基础研究挑战

一位共同的朋友，也是一家大型生产力公司的联合创始人，负责很多研发工作，他表示现在工作日他甚至不怎么和人类交谈了，只是使用各种代理进行构建。所以，某种程度上，生活在未来已经成为现实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it's a I was talking to one of our mutual friends, one of the co-founders of one of these uh you know big productivity companies and he leads a lot of their R&D and he's like man uh during the week these days I'm not even talking to humans anymore as much. I'm just like it's just you know using all all these agents to to build. So it's living in the future to some degree is already in the present.</p>
</details>

Amjad Masad认为这很有趣，人们在公司里是否更少互相交流了？这是坏事吗？他开始更多地思考这些**二阶效应**（Second-order effects: 指一个行动或决策所产生的间接、长期或非预期的后果）。例如，这是否会让新毕业生感到尴尬？他为他们感到难过，如果人们之间不那么分享知识，或者因为“你应该能够使用AI代理”而难以寻求帮助，那么就需要应对一些文化力量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's something interesting about that and that are people talking to each other less at at companies and is that a bad thing? Um so it's a you know I think uh I I I'm starting to think more about these second order effects of of things like that. um uh you know will it make it awkward for like again the new grads I feel so bad for them like uh you know if if people are not sharing as much knowledge between each other or it's like it's not culturally easy to go ask for help because like you should be able to use AI agents uh there's something there's some cultural forces that I think need to be reckoned with.</p>

Adam D'Angelo认为，对于Z世代来说，现在确实面临许多艰难的文化力量。

### 未来投资领域与“Vibe Coding”潜力

Amjad Masad表示，他认为“**Vibe Coding**”（Vibe Coding: 指一种更直观、更具创造性、更少依赖传统编程语法和结构的编码方式，可能通过AI辅助实现）的潜力巨大得令人难以置信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um let's gearing towards closing here. Um obviously you guys are you know focused on running your companies but to stay current on the AI ecosystem. You you guys also make angel investments as well. Um where are you guys most uh most excited? Um you we haven't talked about robotics. Are you guys bullish on on robotics in the in the near term or any emerging categories or use cases or spaces that you're looking to make more investments in or you have made some? I just think vibe coding generally is just unbelievably like high potential. Um just the idea that all the you know this</p>
</details>

他认为Vibe Coding被低估了，它将软件的潜力开放给了主流大众。他觉得它被低估的一个原因是，目前的工具与专业软件工程师所能做到的还有很大差距。但如果想象它们能够达到那个水平（他认为没有理由不达到，可能需要几年时间），那么世界上每个人都将能够创造出原本需要100名专业软件工程师团队才能完成的东西，这将为所有人带来巨大的机会。因此，他认为Replit是一个很好的例子，但除了构建应用程序之外，它还会创造其他案例。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you think underhyped even still I think so I I I think you know just opening up the potential of software to the mainstream of you know every everyone. I think that and yeah and actually I think one reason I think it's underhyped is that the tools are still very far from what you can do as a professional software engineer and if you imagine that they're going to get there and I think there's no reason why they wouldn't might it'll take a few years but um then it's like everyone in the world is going to be able to create any things that would have taken a team of 100 professional software engineers that's just going to massive open up opportunities for for everyone. So I think Replet is like a great example of this, but I think it's also going to that there will be cases other than just like building applications that that this also creates.</p>
</details>

如果现在（2025年）进入斯坦福或哈佛大学，你还会主修计算机科学，还是只专注于构建一些东西？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By the way, just on that note, if you were going to Stanford or Harvard, you know, today 2025, just entering, would you major again in computer science or just focus on building something or</p>
</details>

Adam D'Angelo表示他会。他于2002年开始上大学，当时正是互联网泡沫破裂之后，普遍存在悲观情绪。他记得他的室友的父母告诉他不要学习计算机科学，尽管他非常喜欢。但他只是因为喜欢而做了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think I would. I mean I I I went to college starting in 2002 and it was right after the dotcom bubble had burst and there was a lot of pessimism and I remember my um my roommate his parents had told him like don't study computer science even though that was that was something he really liked. Um and I just kind of did it because I I liked it. And I think that I think that it's definitely like the job market is worse than it was a few years ago.</p>
</details>

Adam D'Angelo认为，尽管就业市场比几年前差，但拥有理解算法和数据结构基本原理的技能，实际上在管理AI代理时非常有帮助。他猜测这在未来仍将是一项有价值的技能。另一个问题是，你还会学习什么？你所能想象的每件事，都有理由认为它会被自动化。所以，你不如学习你喜欢的东西，他认为这和任何其他选择一样好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At the same time, I think having these skills to understand the sort of fundamentals of what's possible with algorithms and data structures, I think that actually really helps you in in managing agents when when you're using them. Um, and I I I'm guessing that it will continue to be a valuable skill in the future. I also think the other question is like what else are you going to study? And and every single thing you could imagine, there's an argument for why it's going to be automated. So, I think you might as well study what you enjoy and and and I think this is as good as as anything.</p>
</details>

Amjad Masad表示，有很多值得兴奋的事情。其中一件可能有点随机，但他看到像DeepSeek OCR这样的疯狂科学实验时会非常兴奋。他问Adam D'Angelo是否看到了，那真是太疯狂了。如果他没记错的话，通过文本的截图而不是纯文本，可以更经济地利用上下文窗口。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I um I think there's a lot to to get excited by. One thing is maybe kind of random, but like I get really fired up to see like mad science experiments like the uh Deepseek OCR that came out the other day. Did you Did you see it? It's It's wild where um correct me if I'm wrong cuz I only looked at it briefly, but basically you can um get a lot more economical with a context window if you like have a screenshot of the text instead of the [ __ ] text.</p>
</details>

Adam D'Angelo表示他不是纠正这个问题的合适人选，但确实有一些非常有趣的事情。他前几天在Hacker News上看到了另一个关于**文本扩散**（Text diffusion: 指一种生成模型，通过逐步去噪过程从随机噪声中生成文本）的东西，有人通过不进行去噪，而是使用单个BERT实例，遮盖不同的词，并预测这些不同的**令牌**（Tokens: 指文本被分解成的最小有意义单位，可以是单词、子词或字符）来创建了一个文本扩散模型。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I'm not I'm not the right person to be correcting you on. than that. But like it's there's there's definitely some some really interesting things.

Amjad Masad认为，我们有很多组件，人们可能没有充分思考。我们现在有基础预训练模型、所有这些强化学习推理模型、编码器-解码器模型、扩散模型，所有这些不同的东西，你可以用不同的方式混合它们。

他觉得这方面的工作还不够多。如果有一家新的研究公司出现，不试图与OpenAI等公司竞争，而是专注于探索如何将这些不同的组件组合起来，创造出这些模型的新“风味”，那将是很棒的。

<p class="english-text">Yeah. Uh I feel like there isn't a lot of that. I mean it' be great. It'd be great if like a new research company just like comes out and is like not trying to like compete with OpenI and things like that but instead uh is just trying to like discover how to put these different components together in order to create a new flavor of these models.</p>

Adam D'Angelo指出，在加密货币领域，人们谈论**可组合性**（Composability: 指系统或组件可以灵活地组合在一起，以创建新的功能或系统）以及混合基本元素。也许在AI领域需要更多的探索。

<p class="english-text">Yeah. In crypto they talk about composability and like mixing primitives together and and AI maybe there needs to be more exploation.</p>

Amjad Masad发现，现在“玩耍”的成分少了。他记得在Web 2.0时代，当他们还在探索JavaScript、浏览器和Web Worker能做什么时，有很多非常有趣和奇怪的实验。Replit就是在那样的背景下诞生的，Replit的最初开源版本（在公司成立之前）的兴趣点是“你能将C语言编译成JavaScript吗？”这在当时是一个非常糟糕的“**黑客**”（Hack: 指一种非正统、快速但可能不够优雅的解决方案），后来演变成了WebAssembly。但他认为，我们现在处于一个硅谷非常“**快速致富**”（Get-rich driven: 指以迅速获取财富为主要驱动力的心态或文化）的时代，这让他有点难过，这也是他将公司迁出旧金山的部分原因。他觉得旧金山的文化可能变得像互联网泡沫时代或加密货币热潮时期那样，过于追求快速致富。因此，他认为需要更多的修修补补，他希望看到更多这样的情况，以及更多致力于做一些更具创新性（即使不意味着全新的模型）的公司获得资助。

<p class="english-text">There's less playing around I found like there is like I remember in the like web 2.0 era when we were like playing around with JavaScript what browsers could do and what web workers could do whatever there was a lot of like really interesting weird experiments I mean replet was born out of that the original version of replet in open source pre pre the company which my interest was like can you compile C to JavaScript right that was like one of the interesting things that became WM by the time it was uh mcriptton and it was like such a such a nasty hack and um but I think there's so much I think We're in an era of Silicon Valley where it's like very uh very getrich driven and that makes me a little sad and that's partly why I moved the company out of SF. I feel like the culture in SF has has gotten maybe to maybe I I I wasn't there but like during the com era a lot of people talked about how it's sort of like get rich fast or the crypto thing. So I feel like there needs to be a lot more tinkering and I would love to see more of that and more companies getting funded that are trying to just do something a little more novel even if it doesn't mean like it fundamentally new new model.</p>

### 意识的难题与基础研究的价值

最后一个问题，Amjad Masad，你长期以来一直对意识感兴趣。你是否看好我们通过AI工作或其他科学进展，能在理解这个“**难题**”（Hard problem: 指意识如何从物理大脑中产生的主观体验问题，被认为是科学和哲学中最难的问题之一）方面取得一些进展？最近发生了一些有趣的事情，Claude 4.5似乎变得更能意识到其上下文长度。当它接近上下文末尾时，它会更经济地使用令牌，而且在被**红队测试**（Redteamed: 指对AI系统进行对抗性测试，以发现其安全漏洞、偏见或不当行为）或在测试环境中时，它的意识似乎显著增强。所以，那里发生了一些非常有趣的事情。

<p class="english-text">Last question. Um Amad you've uh been into consciousness for a long time. Are are you bullish that we will um via some of this AI work or just some you scientific progress elsewhere make some progress in understand in in uh you know getting across this this hard problem or you know something happened recently uh which is interesting um uh cloud 4.5 uh seemed to have to become more aware of its context length. So as it gets closer to the end of the context, it starts be becoming more economical with tokens, it also it looks like its awareness when it's being redteamed or in a test environment like jumped significantly. And so there's something happening there that's quite interesting.</p>

Amjad Masad认为，关于意识的问题，它仍然从根本上不是一个科学问题，我们已经放弃了尝试使其科学化。但他认为，这正是他之前提到的所有精力都投入到LLM中的问题。没有人真正尝试思考智能的真正本质、意识的真正本质。有很多非常核心的问题。例如，他最喜欢的一个是**罗杰·彭罗斯**（Roger Penrose: 英国数学物理学家、诺obel奖得主，以其对黑洞和意识的研究而闻名）的《**皇帝新脑**》（The Emperor's New Mind: 罗杰·彭罗斯的著作，认为人类意识无法完全用计算理论解释）。在这本书中，他试图表明大脑从根本上不可能是计算机，因为人类能够做**图灵机**（Turing machines: 一种理论计算模型，能够模拟任何算法，是现代计算机科学的基础）无法做到的事情，或者图灵机在某些方面会陷入困境，例如基本的逻辑谜题，我们能够检测到，但无法在图灵机中编码。例如，“这个陈述是假的。”这些都是古老的逻辑谜题。

<p class="english-text">Now I think uh in terms of you know the the question of of consciousness it is still fundamentally not a scientific question and there is a sort of uh we've given up on trying to make it scientific but I think it I think this is also uh the problem that I talked about with all the energy going into LMS um uh no one is trying to really think about the true nature of intelligence, true nature of uh consciousness. Um, and there's a lot of really core core questions. Like one of my favorite one is uh the uh Roger Penrose um Emperor's New Mind where he wrote a book about how everyone in the sort of philosophy of mind space uh and perhaps the larger scientific ecosystem start thinking about the brain in terms of a computer. And in that book he tried to show that it fundamentally is impossible for the brain to be uh a computer because uh humans uh are able to do things that touring machines cannot do or Turing machines like fundamentally get get stuck on such as um uh you know just uh basic logic um puzzles uh that we're able to kind of detect, but like there's no way to encode that in a in a in a cheering machine. For example, like this statement is false. You know, those like old logic puzzles.</p>

Amjad Masad表示，这是一个复杂的论证，但如果你读那本书或许多其他书，你会发现心智理论中有一系列核心论点，关于计算机与人类智能从根本上是不同的。他一直很忙，所以没有太多更新他的想法，但他认为那里有一个巨大的研究领域没有被研究。

<p class="english-text">Um and uh anyways it's like a complicated argument but uh if you read that book or or many others uh there's like a core strain of arguments in the theory of mind about how uh computers uh are fundamentally different from from human intelligence and uh and so yeah I I haven't really I've been very busy so I haven't really updated my thinking too much about that But but I think there's there's a there's a there's a huge field of study there that is not being studied.</p>

如果现在你是一名大学新生，你会学习哲学吗？

<p class="english-text">If you were a freshman uh entering college today, would you study philosophy?</p>
</details>

Amjad Masad表示他会。他肯定会学习心智哲学，他可能会进入神经科学领域。因为他认为这些是核心问题，随着AI在工作、经济等方面继续发展，这些问题将变得非常非常重要。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I would do that. I would definitely study philosophy of mind. I would probably go into neuroscience. Uh cuz I think those are the core questions that are kind of become very very important as AI kind of continues to see more of jobs and economy and things like that.</p>

这是一个很好的结束点。Amjad和Adam，感谢你们来到播客。
