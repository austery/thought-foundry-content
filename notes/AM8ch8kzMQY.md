### 总统周年庆募款

**Tracy Mumford**: 来自《纽约时报》，为您播报今日头条。我是 Tracy Mumford。今天是 2 月 9 日，星期一。以下是我们今天关注的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Monday, February 9th. Here's what we're covering.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 在我竞选总统期间，我曾承诺要为美国举办一场有史以来最盛大的生日派对，庆祝美国的 250 周年。而《纽约时报》的一项新调查发现，作为特朗普总统庆祝国家 250 周年计划的一部分，他的盟友们正以至少一百万美元的捐款为交换，提供接触总统和其他特权的机会，捐款对象是一家新成立的组织。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: In my campaign for president, I pledged to give America the most spectacular birthday party the world has ever seen for America's 250th anniversary. A new investigation from the Times has found that as part of President Trump's plans to celebrate the country's 250th anniversary. His allies are offering access to the president and other perks in exchange for donations of at least a million dollars to a new organization.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 为了帮助实现这些激动人心的计划，我们创建了一个新的公私伙伴关系，名为“**自由 250**”（Freedom 250）。它与各州、公司和组织合作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: To help carry out these exciting plans, we have created a new public private partnership. It's called Freedom 250. working with states, companies, and organizations across

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 该组织“自由 250”正计划举办一系列浮夸的活动和纪念项目，非常有特朗普的风格。这包括一座俯瞰华盛顿特区的巨大新**大理石拱门**，一场在首都街道上举行的**印地赛车比赛**，以及在特朗普生日当天，在**白宫草坪**上举办一场终极格斗锦标赛。虽然国会早在十年前就已成立了一个名为“**美国 250**”（America 250）的委员会来规划周年庆典，但新成立的“自由 250”拥有一个更为不透明的公司结构。并且，就像特朗普的“**白宫舞厅项目**”（White House Ballroom Project）一样，“自由 250”已成为人们和公司讨好总统的另一种方式。例如，根据我的同事们获得的一份募款宣传材料显示，捐款 250 万美元或以上的捐助者，将有机会在 7 月 4 日于华盛顿特区举行的一场活动中发表演讲。这是特朗普全力投入募款的最新例证，尽管大多数总统在第二个任期内通常会减少募款活动。过去一年里，他及其盟友已为他青睐的政治事业和“激情项目”筹集了约 20 亿美元。而《纽约时报》发现，许多捐助者要么从政府的行动或声明中获益，要么本身就参与了从中受益的行业。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: the group. Freedom 250 is planning flashy events and monuments that are very Trump. That includes a massive new marble arch overlooking DC, an indie car race through the streets of the capital, and an ultimate fighting championship match on the White House lawn on Trump's birthday. While there was already a commission called America 250 established by Congress a decade ago to plan anniversary celebrations, the newly formed Freedom 250 has a more opaque corporate structure. And like Trump's White House Ballroom Project, Freedom 250 has emerged as another way for people and companies to curry favor with the president. Donors who give 2.5 million or more, for example, are being offered speaking roles at an event in DC on July 4th, according to a fundraising pitch that my colleagues got a hold of. It's the latest example of how Trump has gone allin on fundraising, even though most presidents usually dial that back in their second terms. In the past year, he and his allies have raised roughly $2 billion for his favored political causes and passion projects. The Times has found that many of those donors have either benefited from or are involved in an industry that's benefited from the administration's actions or statements.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 针对这些问题，白宫和“自由 250”的代表们淡化了有关“出售接触权”的担忧。一位该组织的发言人表示：“总统非常感谢他的捐助者，但与过去的政客不同，他不会被任何人收买。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: In response to questions, representatives for the White House and Freedom 250 downplayed concerns about selling access with a spokeswoman for the group saying, quote, "The president is incredibly grateful to his donors, but unlike the politicians of the past, he can't be bought by anyone."

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 值得注意的是，早在 1976 年，国家上一次大型生日庆典也曾面临关于谁在“埋单”的质疑。尼克松总统被指控安插政治盟友进入规划委员会，而当时的活动有如此多的企业捐助者，以至于人们开始称之为“**买买百周年纪念**”（Buy Buy Centennial）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Notably, back in 1976, the country's last big birthday celebration also faced questions about who was footing the bill. President Nixon was accused of stacking the planning commission with political allies, and the events had so many corporate donors that people began to call it the by Buy Centennial.

</details>

### 基建拨款政治交易

**Tracy Mumford**: 现在，再带来三条关于政府的快速更新。一位联邦法官已命令**白宫**解冻一项在纽约的重大基础设施项目的数十亿美元联邦资金，该项目是一条横跨**哈德逊河**的铁路隧道。去年政府停摆期间，政府曾冻结这笔资金，当时的目标是民主党选区，以向议员施压。此后，《纽约时报》获悉，特朗普政府高级官员曾告知纽约州参议员**查克·舒默**（Chuck Schumer），他们将释放这笔资金，但前提是他同意将**宾夕法尼亚车站**（Penn Station）和**华盛顿杜勒斯国际机场**（Washington Dulles Airport）以特朗普总统的名字命名。舒默参议员对这两个设施均无直接管辖权，他拒绝了这一提议。白宫未回应置评请求。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Now, three more quick updates on the administration. A federal judge has ordered the White House to unfreeze billions of dollars in federal funding for a major infrastructure project in New York, a rail tunnel under the Hudson River. The administration had frozen the money during the government shutdown last year when it was targeting Democratic districts to turn up the pressure on lawmakers. Since then, the Times has learned that top Trump administration officials told New York Senator Chuck Schumer that they would release the funds, but only if he agreed to name Penn Station and Washington Dillis Airport after President Trump. Schumer, who has no direct oversight over either of those facilities, rebuffed them. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

</details>

### 特朗普种族歧视帖文

**Tracy Mumford**: 此外，还有共和党人呼吁您为那篇帖子道歉。您会这样做吗？不，我没有犯错。我的意思是，我看了成千上万的东西。周五，在包括党内一些人士在内的广泛批评之后，特朗普总统删除了他发布的一条种族主义社交媒体帖子，该帖子将**贝拉克·奥巴马**和**米歇尔·奥巴马**描绘成猿猴。**白宫**最初为该帖子辩护，然后将其归咎于一名未具名的工作人员，最后特朗普在政治压力下罕见地退让，将其删除。尽管他并未为最初分享该帖子道歉，但这又是特朗普宣扬冒犯性图像和诽谤言论的最新例证。参议员**蒂姆·斯科特**（Tim Scott），参议院中唯一的黑人共和党人，称其为“我见过来自这个白宫的最种族主义的东西”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Also, the number of Republicans are calling on you to apologize for that post. Is that something you're going to do? No, I didn't make a mistake. I mean, you give I look at a lot of thousands of things. On Friday, after widespread backlash, including from some within his own party, President Trump deleted a racist social media post he'd made, which showed Barack and Michelle Obama as apes. The White House originally defended the post, then blamed it on an unnamed staffer before Trump finally took it down in a rare moment of retreat under political pressure. Though he did not apologize for sharing it in the first place, it was the latest example of Trump promoting offensive imagery and slurs. Senator Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate, called it quote, "The most racist thing I've seen out of this White House."

### 移民执法对峙

**Tracy Mumford**: 在国会，关于特朗普总统强硬移民执法的对峙本周将达到高潮。我们需要积极推进，并确保作为任何国土安全部（DHS）支出法案的一部分，能够通过立法改革。因为民主党人坚持认为，如果没有对**美国移民及海关执法局**（ICE）特工行为的严格新限制，他们就不会为**国土安全部**（DHS）提供资金。如果没有达成妥协，**DHS**的资金将于周五到期。左翼已经完全失控，他们正在威胁我们特工的安全和保障，使他们无法履行职责。然而，共和党人迄今为止一直拒绝民主党的要求，例如要求特工在无法达成协议时必须表明身份。**DHS**的几个部门，包括**交通安全管理局**（TSA）、**联邦紧急事务管理局**（FEMA）、**海岸警卫队**和**特勤局**的资金都将耗尽。其中许多机构将继续运作，但员工将无法获得报酬。一些民主党人建议，在他们继续就**ICE**的限制进行谈判的同时，单独为这些机构提供资金。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And in Congress, the standoff over President Trump's aggressive immigration enforcement is going to come to a head this week. We need to press forward aggressively and ensure that there are legislative changes enacted as part of any DHS spending bill. Because Democrats have insisted they won't fund the Department of Homeland Security without strict new guard rails on the behavior of ICE agents. And without a compromise, funding for DHS will run out on Friday. The left has gone completely overboard and they're threatening the safety and security of our agents so that they cannot do their job. Republicans, however, have so far rejected Democrats demands like having agents unmask if they can't reach a deal. Several parts of DHS, including the TSA, FEMA, the Coast Guard, and the Secret Service will run out of funding. Many of those agencies would continue operating, but employees would have to go without pay. Some Democrats have suggested funding those agencies separately while they continue to negotiate limits on ICE.

### 美军弹药流入墨西哥

**Tracy Mumford**: 在墨西哥，警察甚至该国的军队发现自己被贩毒集团压制。贩毒集团已获得了重型火力，在某些情况下包括 50 口径弹药。这些弹药非常巨大，长度相当于一只手。它们最初是为了攻击坦克和飞机而开发的。贩毒集团的枪手用它们来暗杀政府官员、屠杀平民，甚至击落直升机。现在，《纽约时报》和**国际调查记者联合会**（International Consortium of Investigative Journalists）的一份新报告显示，部分弹药不仅来自美国，而且是为美军制造的。我的同事们获得了多起事件的文件，墨西哥当局称，弹壳上印有**湖城陆军弹药厂**（Lake City Army Ammunition Plant）的标记，该厂位于密苏里州堪萨斯城附近。它由美国政府拥有，由私人承包商运营，是五角大楼步枪弹药的最大供应商。但该工厂也允许进行商业销售给零售商。陆军发言人表示，这每年为美国纳税人节省数千万美元，因为它降低了政府的弹药成本。在某些情况下，从零售商那里购买弹药的平民随后将其转交给走私者。几乎任何年满 18 岁的美国人都可以购买任何类型、任何数量的步枪弹药，甚至是穿甲弹。数据显示，**湖城**尤其成为墨西哥贩毒集团冲突中使用的 50 口径弹药的主要来源。美国陆军未详细回应有关此事的提问。运营该工厂的现任承包商也未回应。当《纽约时报》采访一位曾发生贩毒集团使用 50 口径弹药进行残酷枪战的城镇的前市长时，他表示得知弹药的来源并不惊讶。他说：“毒品贩子可以拿到任何东西，他们从美国获得最好的武器。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Across Mexico, police and even the country's military are finding themselves outgunned by cartels. The cartels have acquired heavy firepower that in some cases includes 50 caliber ammunition. Those rounds are huge, as long as your hand. They were developed to attack tanks and aircraft. Cartel gunmen have used them to assassinate government officials, massacre civilians, and even down helicopters. Now, a new report from the Times and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists shows that some of that ammunition is not only coming from the US, but was made for the US military. My colleagues obtained files from multiple incidents where Mexican authorities said the casings were marked with the imprint of Lake City Army Ammunition Plant, which is just outside Kansas City, Missouri. It's owned by the US government, run by private contractors, and is the top supplier of rifle rounds to the Pentagon. But the factories also allowed to make commercial sales to retailers. An Army spokesperson said that saves US taxpayers tens of millions a year because it lowers the government's cost for ammunition. In some cases, civilians who bought rounds from retailers then pass them off to smugglers. Pretty much any American over the age of 18 can buy any type and any amount of rifle ammunition, even the armor-piercing variety. Data shows Lake City in particular is a major source of the 50 caliber ammunition being used in cartel battles in Mexico. The US Army did not respond in detail to questions about that. Neither did the current contractor operating the plant. When the Times talked with the former mayor of one town where cartels used 50 caliber rounds in a brutal gun battle, he said he wasn't surprised to learn where they'd come from. He said, quote, "The drug traffickers can get their hands on anything, and they get the best weapons from the United States."

### 体育赛事速递

**Tracy Mumford**: 最后，西雅图队高居榜首。这个周末适合宅在家里，看别人展现惊人的运动能力。**西雅图海鹰队**（Seahawks）击败**新英格兰爱国者队**（Patriots）赢得了超级碗，**坏痞兔**（Bad Bunny）奉献了一场充满活力的演出，基本上是对波多黎各的深情告白。而在意大利，奥运会带来了绝对的悲伤与辉煌的时刻。**林赛·沃恩**（Lindsy Vaughn），史上最伟大的复出之一。林赛·沃恩，即使能站在滑雪板上，也是一个巨大的时刻。41 岁的她试图成为奥运会历史上最年长的奖牌获得者。她带着撕裂的十字韧带在尝试。但在比赛开始约 13 秒后，她摔倒了，不得不被直升机从山上运走。观众起立为这位五届奥运选手鼓掌，这可能是她职业生涯的最后一场比赛。沃恩的队友**布里兹·约翰逊**（Breezy Johnson）赢得了该项目，为美国赢得了 2026 年奥运会的首枚金牌。美国队昨晚还在团体花样滑冰比赛中获得金牌，这在很大程度上要归功于 21 岁的**伊利亚·马里宁**（Ilia Malinin），也被称为“四周跳之神”。他是历史上唯一一位在比赛中完成四周跳（quad axle）的滑冰运动员。他在奥运会个人比赛中将面临的任何对手，都甚至没有尝试过做到这一点。

**Tracy Mumford**: And finally, and that will do it. Seattle reigns above them all. This was the weekend to sit on your couch and watch other people be really athletic. The Seahawks trumped the Patriots to take the Super Bowl with Bad Bunny putting on a joyful riot of a halftime show that was basically a love letter to Puerto Rico. And in Italy, the Olympics provided moments of absolute heartbreak and triumph. Lindsy Vaughn, the comeback of all comebacks. Lindsy Vaughn, even being on skis at all, was a huge moment. At 41, she was trying to become the oldest alpine Olympic medalist ever. And she was trying to do it with a ruptured ACL. But about 13 seconds into her race, I can TELL YOU. OH NO, VON'S GONE. VAN HAS CRASHED OUT. SHE CRASHED AND had to be airlifted off the mountain, the crowd rose to its feet to applaud the fivetime Olympian in what could be the last race of her career. Van's teammate Breezy Johnson won the event, earning the US's first gold medal at the 2026 games. The US also won gold last night in team figure skating, thanks in part to 21-year-old Ilia Malinin, aka the quad god. He is the only skater in history who has landed the quad axle in competition. None of the skaters that he'll be up against in the individual competitions at the Olympics have even attempted to do that.
