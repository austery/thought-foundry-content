### 开场：冥王星、怀旧与自由党历史

**Steve Paikin**: 欢迎大家收看 OnPoly 播客。我是 **Steve Paikin**，我是 **John Michael McGrath**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Paikin**: Welcome everyone to the OnPaly podcast. I'm Steve Pagan and I'm John Michael McGrath.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 在今天的节目中，看来省长 **Doug Ford** 不必再把更多的 **Crown Royal**（皇冠威士忌）倒进下水道了。他已经与该品牌的制造商达成了和解。此外，在批评者抱怨高等教育系统被“断粮”超过 7 年后，省政府正为学院和大学提供一线生机，但同时也对 **OSAP**（安大略省学生援助计划）做出了重大调整。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: Today on the pod, it looks like Premier Doug Ford won't have to pour any more Crown Royal down the drain. He's made peace with that brand's manufacturer. After critics complained about more than 7 years of starving the postsecondary system, the province is giving colleges and universities a lifeline but making significant changes to OSAP.

</details>

**Steve Paikin**: 但**学区委员会**的情况并非如此。有传言称教育部长打算废除他们，而他最近的任何行动都没有消除这种疑虑。在我们的专栏环节，我将主张重新禁止**在线赌博**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Paikin**: Not the case for school boards, however. Rumors persist that the education minister is going to get rid of them. And none of his recent actions is disabusing anyone of that notion. And in your column, my column, I will make the case for reprohibiting uh online gambling.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: “重新禁止”，这词儿挺新鲜。我则关注一个我认为依然重要且并非过时观念的话题：**公共生活中的文明礼仪**。今天是 2026 年 2 月 20 日，星期五。JMM，见到你真高兴。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: Rep-prohibiting. Okay, that's a neat word. And I'm focusing on something I still think is important and not some old-fashioned notion, and that is civility in public life. It's Friday, February 20th, 2026. So, let's get to it. JMM, good to see you, pal.

</details>

**Steve Paikin**: 我看到你穿着一件写着“**冥王星**，永不忘记 1930-2006”的 T 恤。我猜 1930 年是它被发现的年份，而 2006 年是它被判定不再是行星的年份。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Paikin**: Now, I see that you're in morning and you know it's a for those who are listening on podcast and can't see this. You are wearing a shirt. Which says Pluto, never forget 1930, which I presume was the year the planet was discovered. To 2006, which I presume is the year that it was determined it is no longer a planet.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 是的，那是天文学家对我们所有人“犯罪”并将冥王星从九大行星中降级的年份。这让我觉得自己老了。为了表达团结，也因为我们这里流行穿极客 T 恤，我今天穿了这件。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: Yes. the the year that astronomers sinned against us all and demoted uh Pluto from the the ranks of the the the nine planets. Uh you know... this August, will be 20 years since uh the the Astronomical Association uh stripped Pluto of its uh rightful god-given title. And uh and that made me feel really old. And uh so uh in a bit of solidarity, I thought I would wear this t-shirt. And also just because it's a nerdy thing and uh we we wear nerdy t-shirts here.

</details>

**Steve Paikin**: 我今天穿的是 **David Peterson**（安大略省第 20 任省长）。明天就是 1982 年 2 月 21 日 Peterson 赢得安大略省自由党党魁职位的 44 周年纪念。当时他只有 38 岁。他终结了进步保守党长达 42 年的统治。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Paikin**: We do. Well, okay. Time for time for me to plead guilty to that. Here we go. I am wearing David Peterson today... why am I wearing a a t-shirt with Ontario's 20th premier on it? Well, I'm going to tell you because there's a lot of talk these days about the Ontario Liberals who are in the midst of yet another leadership convention... David Peterson won the leadership of the Ontario Liberals when he was 38, right? He's the guy who ended the 42-year long PC dynasty, which ended in 1985.

</details>

### 省政府与酒业巨头 Diageo 的和解

**Steve Paikin**: 让我们进入第一个议题。在 **Doug Ford** 的第三个任期中，最标志性的画面之一就是他在镜头前痛斥英国酒业制造商 **Diageo**（帝亚吉欧），并将一瓶 **Crown Royal** 倒在地上，以抗议该公司关闭位于阿默斯特堡（Amherstburg）的工厂。但现在，双方似乎达成了一项 2300 万加元的“和平协议”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Paikin**: Let's get off to issue one. It was one of the most iconic images of Doug Ford's current third term as premier excoriating the British liquor manufacturer Diagio in front of all the cameras. Ford emptied a bottle of Crown Royal all over the pavement to indicate his opposition to Diagio's closing one of its plants in Ammerisburg... But it seems the premier and the manufacturer have found a $23 million peace offering.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 政府称 **Diageo** 同意在安大略省投资 2300 万加元，以抵消阿默斯特堡工厂关闭造成的就业损失。虽然工厂依然会关闭，但政府将其宣传为一场胜利，称如果没有省长的压力，这些投资就不会发生。作为回报，**Diageo** 的品牌将继续留在 **LCBO**（安大略省酒类管理局）的货架上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: Peace in our time, right? Uh the government says that Dagio has agreed to make $23 million in investments in Ontario to offset the jobs lost from the closure at the Amhersburg plant. Now to be clear, that closure is still going ahead... the government is touting this as a win... and for its part uh Ontario says that because of this settlement, DIO brands will stay on the shelves at the LCBO.

</details>

**Steve Paikin**: 这 2300 万加元都花在哪了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Paikin**: So 23 million bucks. Where are they spending it on on what?

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 只有 100 万加元直接用于阿默斯特堡。另外有 300 万用于多伦多的预调酒包装，200 万用于士嘉堡的包装合作伙伴。最离谱的是，其中 **1100 万加元**实际上只是 **Diageo** 从安大略省东部的一家工业乙醇厂（Greenfield Global）购买酒精的货款。这只是大宗商品采购，根本算不上通常意义上的“投资”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: There's $1 million in this package that is being spent on uh economic development and other community projects in Amherstburg itself... Then there's $3 million in a new ready-to-drink alcoholic beverage uh package that will be supplied via uh a Toronto partner company... fully $11 million of these so-called investments... is a single large purchase by Dagio of alcohol uh for blending in their products... This is not what you or I would normally describe as an investment.

</details>

### 高等教育拨款与 OSAP 政策重大调整

**Steve Paikin**: 八年前，进步保守党上台后做的第一件事就是冻结学院和大学的学费。结果导致课程取消、员工被裁。现在，政府似乎正在转向。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Paikin**: When the progressive conservatives took power nearly eight years ago, one of the first things they did was freeze college and university tuition rates, thereby starving the post-secary system of the money it needed to keep the lights on... Nearly eight years later, the government seems to be changing course.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 政府正在结束学费冻结，允许大学在未来三年内每年涨薪 2%。同时，省政府将每年的拨款从 54 亿加元增加到 70 亿加元。但最具争议的是 **OSAP** 的变化：以前学生获得的资助中，高达 85% 是无需偿还的**助学金（Grants）**，现在这个比例被降到了 **25%**。剩下的部分将全部变为需要偿还的**贷款**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: So, the government is uh allowing tuitions to uh increase again. They are ending the freeze... they are increasing the funding for universities and colleges from $5.4 billion to $7 billion annually... the most controversial uh change is almost certainly their changes to OSAP... Currently, the students uh who access OSAP are able to receive up to 85% of their assistance in uh the form of grants... that threshold is being lowered to 25%.

</details>

**Steve Paikin**: 对于那些对 OSAP 调整感到不满的学生，**Doug Ford** 省长是怎么说的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Paikin**: The premier had some things to say to students who are very unhappy with the changes to OSAP that are coming down.

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 省长说：“你们选了**编篮子（basket weaving）**课程，但外面没那么多篮子可卖。去学医疗保健，去学技工，去学未来的职业。”这种言论显然无助于推行政策。虽然增加拨款是好事，但安大略省的人均教育支出依然在全国垫底。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: Doug Ford: "you're picking basket weaving courses and there's not too many baskets being sold out there. Go into healthcare. Go into uh trades. Go into uh jobs of the of the future." ...that line from the premier about basket weaving maybe not helpful.

</details>

### 学区委员会面临被废除的传闻

**Steve Paikin**: 本周有更多证据表明，**学区委员会（School Boards）**深感忧虑，担心会被省政府立法废除。滑铁卢地区学区委员会主席已致信教育部长，要求在做出任何不可逆转的决定前进行全省咨询甚至全民公投。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Paikin**: Well, we've got some more evidence this week that school boards are deeply concerned that they're about to be legislated out of existence by this provincial government. Mith Radlin is the chair of the Waterlue Region District School Board and she has written the education minister formally requesting his ministry undertake a comprehensive provincewide consultation or even a referendum...

</details>

**John Michael McGrath**: 目前已有七个学区委员会处于省政府的监管之下。传言称省政府将保留具有宪法保护的**天主教委员会**和**法语委员会**，但会废除**英语公共学区委员会**。如果取消了民选的受托人（Trustees），家长在遇到学区官僚问题时将失去倡导者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: Yeah. So, this is builds on a number of signs we've seen from the government... many rumors that the province will simply as you say legislate the school boards out of existence... the minister... has always caveed it by saying that he is going to leave the Catholic boards alone and leave the French language uh school boards alone because they have uh constitutional protections...

</details>

**Steve Paikin**: 学区受托人是加拿大历史上最古老的民选职位，甚至早于联邦成立。如果你要废除一个存在了 158 年的东西，最好深思熟虑。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Paikin**: I think what we are saying is the position of school board trustee is the oldest elected position in Canadian history. They predate Confederation and if you're going to get rid of something that has existed for literally more than 158 years, uh you better have thought it through.

</details>

### 专栏讨论：禁止在线赌博与政治文明

**John Michael McGrath**: 我的专栏讨论了**在线体育赌博**的泛滥。证据显示这正在腐蚀体育运动，并对低收入人群（尤其是年轻男性）造成不成比例的财务伤害。安大略省每年从中仅获利约 2.5 亿加元，这在省预算规模中微不足道。我们不应该在口袋里装一个“赌场”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: ...not only do we have plenty of evidence that the explosion in online sports gambling is corrosive to sports, uh we know that it is uh disproportionately creating financial harms for people with lower incomes... we were never really meant to have casinos in our pockets and that is what we have now.

</details>

**Steve Paikin**: 我的专栏则关于**政治文明**。数据调查显示，尽管处于政治毒性极强的时代，各个党派和年龄层的民众依然渴望政治文明。例如，加拿大总理和反对党领袖在卑诗省大规模谋杀案悼念仪式上携手而立，这种团结的形象对人们意义重大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Paikin**: ...fresh data with us on whether the public cares about... namely civility in politics. And do we care about it, particularly in this age of political toxicity? And I am delighted to report that apparently yes, we do across all party stripes and supporters in all age demographics.

</details>

### 听众来信：省长参加付费活动的伦理争议

**John Michael McGrath**: 听众 Kathleen 问：省长 **Doug Ford** 参加《环球邮报》举办的门票高达 1000 加元的会议并担任演讲嘉宾，这是否合乎伦理？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**John Michael McGrath**: This is an email from listener Kathleen from Whitby who writes... "Doug Ford is going to be a speaker at this future-based dialogue and tickets are $1,000. Is this ethical? ...It seems like something you should do after you're done being the premier."

</details>

**Steve Paikin**: 省长办公室确认他没有接受任何演讲费。根据《议员诚信法》（Members Integrity Act），议员禁止接受与其职务相关的礼金或费用。当年 **Justin Trudeau** 作为后座议员时曾因收取演讲费引发风波，之后便停止了这种行为。在现行制度下，Ford 并没有违规。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Paikin**: ...the premier is not accepting any kind of speaking fee. They also emphasized he has never accepted any kind of speaking fee for these kinds of public engagements... this falls under the Members Integrity Act. And generally speaking, MPPPS are forbidden from accepting gifts or fees that are connected either directly or indirectly with their duties as NPPs.
