### 投票权法案争议

**主持人**: 来自《纽约时报》，这是今日头条。我是特蕾西·蒙福德。今天我们报道：**《拯救美国法案》并不复杂，真的不复杂，也不激进，它非常明确。如果你想在美国大选中投票，你只需要证明你是美国人。在华盛顿，《纽约时报》正在报道共和党议员们日益加剧的努力，以推动新的投票限制措施。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Wednesday, February 18th. Here's what we're covering. The Save America Act is not complicated. It's really not. It's not radical. It's crystal clear. If you want to vote in American elections, all you got to do is prove that you're an American. In Washington, the Times is covering an intensifying effort by Republican lawmakers to push for new voting restrictions.

</details>

**引述者**: 唯一反对它的人，是那些想作弊、想非法、不合法地参与我们选举制度的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> And the only people that oppose it are people who want to cheat our system, who want to participate in our elections uh illegally, unlawfully.

</details>

**主持人**: 就在上周，众议院通过了《拯救美国法案》，该法案要求投票时出示美国公民身份证明。现在，众议院共和党人正试图围绕另一项法案——一些人称之为“加强版的《拯救美国法案》”，即“让选举再次伟大”法案——来建立势头。这项法案将禁止普遍的邮寄投票，并禁止计算选举日后收到的选票，此外还有其他规定。它还将赋予**国土安全部**更多权力，从各州获取选民信息。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Just last week, the House passed the Save America Act, which would require proof of US citizenship to vote. And now, House Republicans are trying to build momentum around another bill some of them are calling the Save America Act, but on steroids known as the Make Elections Great Again. This bill would ban universal voting by mail and prohibit counting ballots received after election day, among other provisions. It would also give more authority to the Department of Homeland Security to get information about voters from states.

</details>

**主持人**: 这些并行举措的出现，正值共和党为可能在今年秋季中期选举中遭受重大损失做准备之际。对选举安全的担忧，可能为他们在失去任何选举后提出质疑奠定基础。但这些法案在参议院将面临艰苦的斗争。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

The parallel efforts come as Republicans are bracing for potentially significant losses in the midterms this fall. And raising concerns about election security could lay the groundwork for them to contest any races they lose. But the bills will face a steep uphill battle in the Senate.

</details>

**引述者**: 这简直是一项令人愤慨的立法。它把时钟拨回了一百年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> This is just an outrageous piece of legislation. It's turning the clock back a hundred years.

</details>

**引述者**: **少数党领袖查克·舒默**和其他民主党人已誓言要阻止它们。他们说，共和党人正试图为自己重塑选民结构。他们警告说，这些法律可能会剥夺低收入美国人、有色人种和其他群体的投票权，而这些人是民主党基础的重要组成部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Where Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Democrats have vowed to block them. They say Republicans are trying to reshape the electorate in their favor. And they're warning that the laws could disenfranchise low-income Americans, people of color, and other blocks, some of which are big parts of the Democratic base.

</details>

**引述者**: 如果你是数千万没有出生证明的美国人之一，或者你是没有护照的美国人中的一半，那么《拯救法案》可能会让你无法参与选举。民主党人表示，他们认为共和党在国会的努力是**GOP**（共和党）持续关注投票问题的更大一部分。这包括**特朗普总统**最近呼吁联邦政府接管地方选举。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> If you're one of tens of millions of Americans who does not have access to your birth certificate, or if you're one of the 50% of Americans who don't have a passport, the Save Act could make it impossible for you to participate in elections. The Democrats say they see the Republican efforts in Congress as part of the GOP's larger relentless focus on voting. That includes President Trump's recent calls to have the federal government take control over local elections.

</details>

### 华盛顿快讯

**主持人**: 现在，来自华盛顿的另外三个快速更新。五角大楼昨天宣布，它在加勒比海和太平洋地区炸毁了另外三艘涉嫌贩毒的船只，造成11人死亡。这是今年以来最致命的一天船只袭击事件。自9月份袭击开始以来，美国军方已打死140多人。用武专家称这些袭击是非法的，因为军方不能以平民为目标，即使他们违法。但五角大楼仍在继续袭击，上个月每3到4天就炸毁一艘船。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Now, three other quick updates from Washington. The Pentagon announced yesterday that it blew up three more alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean and the Pacific, killing 11 people. It was the deadliest day of boat strikes this year. The US military has killed more than 140 people since the attacks began in September. Experts on the use of force have called the strikes illegal since the military cannot target civilians who don't pose a threat, even if they're breaking the law. But the Pentagon has kept up the attacks, blowing up boats every 3 to 4 days in the last month.

</details>

**主持人**: 此外，民主党人要求限制联邦移民官员的最新要求昨天被白宫拒绝。他们表示，没有达成协议，他们仍然不会同意为**国土安全部**提供资金。DHS自周六以来一直处于部分关闭状态。共和党人曾提出反建议，其中细节尚未公开，但民主党人认为其“不严肃”而予以驳回。他们表示将继续坚持要求，例如限制移民官员的随意搜捕，以及禁止在学校、教堂和医院等场所进行逮捕。目前，尽管国会山上的辩论仍在继续，但大多数DHS工作人员，如TSA（交通安全管理局）特工和ICE（美国移民及海关执法局）官员，仍坚守岗位，尽管关闭时间越长，他们可能就越拿不到工资。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Also, Democrats latest demands to reign in federal immigration agents were rejected by the White House yesterday. Without a deal, they say they still will not agree to fund the Department of Homeland Security. DHS has been in a partial shutdown since Saturday. Republicans made a counter offer at one point, the details of which aren't public, but Democrats dismissed it, calling it unserious. They say they will continue to hold out for things like restrictions on random sweeps by immigration agents and a ban on arrests in locations like schools, churches, and hospitals. For the moment, while the debate on Capitol Hill continues, most DHS workers like TSA agents and ICE officers have remained on the job, though they may miss paychecks the longer the shutdown drags on.

</details>

**主持人**: 并且，一些民主党议员表示将抵制**特朗普总统**周二发表的国情咨文。取而代之的是，他们将在国家广场举行集会，称之为“人民国情咨文”。该活动将由自由派政治评论员**乔伊·里德**联合主持，并将邀请失业的联邦雇员和被白宫针对的移民参加。一位民主党议员表示，他预计特朗普总统将在官方演讲中撒谎并侮辱民主党人，这让他想跳过演讲，他说：“现在不是正常时期，我们必须停止做正常的事情。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And a number of Democratic lawmakers say they will be boycotting President Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday. Instead, they're putting on a rally on the National Mall and calling it the People's State of the Union. The event will be co-hosted by the liberal political commentator Joy Reid and will feature federal workers who've lost their jobs and immigrants who've been targeted by the White House. One Democratic lawmaker said he expects President Trump to lie and insult Democrats in his official speech, leading him to want to skip it, saying, quote, "These aren't normal times, and we have to stop doing normal things.

### 媒体监管与FCC

**主持人**: 给大家鼓掌，各位。欢迎回来，我的朋友们。哦，这真令人兴奋。本周《科尔伯特深夜秀》的一集节目中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Give it up for the band, everybody. Welcome back, my friends. Oh, this is exciting. >> On an episode of the Late Show this week.

</details>

**主持人**: 你知道，你知道今晚我的嘉宾里没有谁吗？德克萨斯州众议员詹姆斯·塔勒·里科。他本该来的，但我们的律师明确告知我们，我们不能让他上节目。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> You know, you know who is not one of my guests tonight? That's Texas State Representative James Taller Rico. He he was supposed to be here, but we were told in no uncertain terms by our network's lawyers who called us directly that we could not have him on the broadcast.

</details>

**主持人**: **史蒂芬·科尔伯特**说，**CBS**（哥伦比亚广播公司）禁止他播出对这位政治人物的采访，原因是**特朗普政府**关于政治候选人播出时间的**新指导方针**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Steven Colbear said that CBS had barred him from airing an interview because of new guidance from the Trump administration on airtime for political candidates.

</details>

**主持人**: 而且，因为我的网络显然不想让我们谈论此事，让我们来谈谈吧。这是深夜脱口秀节目首次更改其节目安排，以满足**联邦通信委员会（FCC）**更新后的要求。FCC上个月发布了新指导方针，这是对媒体公司因被认为存在偏袒保守派而进行日益严厉打击的一部分。该机构警告称，在地方电视台播出的娱乐导向型脱口秀节目，如果候选人争夺同一职位，则必须提供**平等的播出时间**。媒体公司长期以来一直认为深夜脱口秀节目不受该规则约束，但FCC负责人表示情况不再如此。该指导方针显然是针对那些经常惹恼**特朗普总统**的主持人，如吉米·坎摩尔、塞思·梅耶斯和科尔伯特。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> And because my network clearly doesn't want us to talk about this, let's talk about this. It's the first time that a late night talk show has changed its programming to meet the updated demands from the Federal Communications Commission. The FCC put out its new guidance last month, part of an escalating crackdown on media companies for perceived bias against conservatives. The agency warned that entertainment-oriented talk shows carried on local TV stations are required to offer candidates equal airtime if they're vying for the same office. Media companies had long considered late night talk shows exempt from that rule, but the head of the FCC said that is no longer the case. The guidance was clearly aimed at hosts who frequently anger President Trump, Jimmy Kimmel, Seth Meyers, and Colbear.

</details>

**主持人**: CBS对科尔伯特的说法提出了反驳，称他们并未禁止该采访播出，但“提供了法律指导，认为播出该采访可能会触发FCC规定”。由于“平等时间”条款仅适用于广播，科尔伯特因此将他与塔勒·里科的采访发布到了自己的YouTube页面上。科尔伯特目前正处于主持《科尔伯特深夜秀》的最后阶段，该节目将于五月停播。CBS表示，这纯粹是出于财务考虑。两位熟悉该节目预算的人士告诉《纽约时报》，该节目每年亏损数千万美元。但许多人继续猜测，该网络取消该节目是出于政治原因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

CBS has pushed back on Colbear's version of events, saying it did not prohibit the interview from airing, but quote provided legal guidance that broadcasting it could trigger the FCC rule. Because the equal time provision applies only to broadcast, Colbear posted his interview with Terico to his YouTube page instead. Colbear is in the final stretch of hosting the late show, which will go off the air in May. CBS has said it's purely a financial decision. Two people familiar with the show's budget told the Times it's been losing tens of millions of dollars a year. But many have continued to speculate that the network is cancelling it for political reasons.

### 塔霍湖雪崩搜救

**主持人**: 一个可怕的局面。搜救队目前正在**塞拉**（Sierra）地区，靠近**太浩湖**（Lake Tahoe）的一个偏远地区，与暴风雪天气作斗争。内华达县治安官办公室称，一群野外滑雪者卷入了事故。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

A scary situation. Search and rescue teams are dealing with white out conditions in the Sierra right now >> in a remote part of California near Lake Tahoe. >> The Nevada County Sheriff's Office says a group of backcountry skiers are involved.

</details>

**主持人**: 九名滑雪者在昨天遭遇雪崩后仍然失踪。他们是一个团队的一部分，其中包括一家旅游公司的几名向导。救援人员于昨晚晚些时候成功救出了六名幸存者。治安官办公室表示，他们能够通过幸存者的**紧急信标**找到他们。但强风、大雪和近乎零的能见度使得持续的搜救行动异常困难和危险。这里的**天气条件**是多年来最恶劣的。根据**中央塞拉雪实验室**（Central Sierra Snow Lab）的科学家称，两条主要高速公路的部分路段已关闭，直升机也无法安全抵达现场。仍有发生雪崩的警告。如果剩余的滑雪者未能被找到，这将成为美国几十年来最致命的雪崩事故之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Nine skiers remain missing after they were caught in an avalanche yesterday. They were part of a group including several guides from a tour company. Rescuers were able to reach six survivors late last night. The sheriff's office said they were able to locate them thanks to their emergency beacons. But high winds, heavy snowfall, and near zero visibility have made the ongoing search operation incredibly difficult and dangerous. The conditions are some of the worst there in years. According to scientists at the Central Sierra Snow Lab, parts of two major highways are closed and helicopters can't make it to the site safely. Warnings for more avalanches are still in effect. If the remaining skiers are not found alive, this would rank as among the deadliest avalanches in the US in decades.

### AI视频生成的影响

**主持人**: 最后，一段**汤姆·克鲁斯**和**布拉德·皮特**在摇摇欲坠的屋顶上打斗的视频正在疯传。两位明星拳打脚踢，被废墟环绕，身后是阴郁的日落。这段15秒的片段拥有大片电影的所有元素。但它不是预告片，也不是宣传片，甚至不完全是皮特和克鲁斯本人。它是由**AI视频生成工具Seed Dance**生成的，该工具属于**字节跳动**（Bite Dance）公司，也就是**TikTok**背后的公司。发布者，一位爱尔兰导演说，他用一个两句话的提示词制作了它，这极大地加剧了好莱坞对**AI视频**的担忧，担心随着AI视频的兴起，有多少工作岗位可能会消失，尤其是像这样的打斗场面如此逼真。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

And finally, a video has been making the rounds of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt duking it out on a crumbling rooftop. The stars punch, swing, and block, surrounded by ruins, a moody sunset behind them. The 15-second clip has all the bells and whistles of a big Hollywood movie. But it's not a trailer. It's not a promo. It's not even really Pit and Cruise. It was churned out by an AI video generation tool, Seed Dance, which is owned by Bite Dance, the company behind Tik Tok. The man who posted it, a director from Ireland, said he made it with a twosentence prompt that has supercharged fears in Hollywood about how many jobs could just disappear with the rise of AI videos, especially ones as convincing as this fight scene.

</details>

**主持人**: 《死侍》电影的编剧之一说，这让他脊背发凉。而这一切很可能会影响**美国演员工会**（Screen Actors Guild）和制片公司之间刚刚开始的谈判，谈判将包括要求对AI如何以及是否可以使用演员肖像设定**保障措施**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

One of the writers behind the Deadpool movies said it sent a cold shiver up his spine. And the whole thing is likely to loom large over the negotiations between the Screen Actors Guild and Studios, which have just started again and will include demands for guard rails on how and if AI can use an actor's likeness.

</details>

**主持人**: 尽管如此，并非所有人都对这段视频印象深刻。一位为《瑞克和莫蒂》系列工作的制片人和编剧说，她已经看到了大量类似的视频，并认为人们被这一切的喧嚣所迷惑。她说她“没见过任何让我惊叹的东西。没有发人深省的，没有挑衅性的，甚至没有。这都只是垃圾。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Still, not everyone was impressed with the clip. One producer and writer who works on the series Rick and Morty said she's seen a flood of videos like this and thinks people are getting swept up by the circus of it all. She said she has seen quote nothing that has taken my breath away. Nothing that is poignant, nothing that is provocative even. It's all just garbage.

</details>

### AI工具与工作未来

**主持人**: 这些是今天的头条新闻。机器人是否会来抢你的工作？即使你不是布拉德·皮特。《纽约时报》科技专栏作家**凯文·鲁斯**（Kevin Roose）谈论下一代AI工具。他认为：“这对我来说感觉不同，我认为对很多人来说也是如此，当你可以在不知道如何写代码的情况下实际构建有用的东西时。我认为这就是人们认为将使AI从仅仅是一个更炫酷的谷歌，变成真正改变人们工作方式的东西。”你可以在《纽约时报》应用程序或你获取播客的任何地方收听。我是特蕾西·蒙福德。我们明天再见。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Those are the headlines today on the daily. Are the bots coming for your job next? Even if you're not Brad Pitt Times, tech columnist Kevin Roose on the next generation of AI tools. This feels different to me and I think to a lot of other people when you can actually build something useful without knowing how to write code. And I think this is what people think is the thing that's going to take AI from just kind of being a fancier Google to something that genuinely changes how people work. You can listen to that in the New York Times app or wherever you get your podcasts. I'm Tracy Mumford. We'll be back tomorrow.
