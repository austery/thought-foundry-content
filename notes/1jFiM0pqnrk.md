### 市场收盘概览：在波动中收平

Amit: 好的，大家好，欢迎回到新一期的市场收盘直播。我们正在直播。今天真是跌宕起伏的一天，这一周也是如此。本周在股票市场中航行真是一段相当艰难的旅程，但我们最终以绿色收盘，至少看起来是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market close. We are live. What a day it has been. What a day. What a week. It has been quite the journey navigating the equity markets this week and we are ending green. At least that's what it looks like.</p>
</details>

Amit: 当然，现在的涨幅不如今天盘中高点时那么绿。标普500指数在672点。坦白说，我们今天非常接近收跌。正如我早上所说，收跌并非世界末日，只要跌幅不像盘前那么糟糕就行。标普500指数在672点，理论上可能会跌到668或669点，但那仍然比我们今天早上的663点要好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Now it's not as green as we were at the height of it today. 672 on the S&P 500. Quite frankly, we are very close to going red for the day, which as I said in the morning, it's not the worst thing in the world to end red as long as the red is not as bad as it was in the pre-markets. 672 on the S&P 500. could theoretically get to like 668, 69 and still that would be better than the 663 level that we had this morning.</p>
</details>

Amit: 特斯拉收绿，早上曾跌至382美元，现在是绿的。Robinhood一度达到114美元，现在是123美元。英伟达曾是191美元，现在是189美元。临近收盘时出现了一些抛售。有几条可能影响市场的头条新闻，我们稍后会讨论。AMD未能翻绿。Nebia仍然下跌5%。CoreWeave几乎翻绿，一度确实变绿了。Capp涨到80美元，现在又回到77美元，下跌了。Netflix因为市场担心其收购华纳兄弟探索公司而下跌。Palantir在174美元翻绿，一度达到176美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Tesla green it was at 382 in the morning. Right now it's green. Robin got to 114. It's at 123. Nvidia was at 191. Now it's at 189. You're getting a little bit of a selloff as we get to the close. Couple different headlines that could be affecting it that we'll talk about in a second. AMD could not go green. Nebia is still down 5%. CoreWeave almost it did go green for a bit. Capp to 80 now back at 77. That's down. Netflix down because of some concerns of them buying Warner Brothers Discovery. Palantir going green at 174. At one point, Palantir got to 176.</p>
</details>

Amit: 基本上，你可以看到很多这类资产要么收绿，要么微绿，要么微红，这并非最坏的情况。标普指数刚刚翻红，但仍在670点以上。BMR今天大跌，下跌了6.3%。以太坊在3100美元，下跌1%。比特币也一样，在过去30分钟里从97,000美元回落到94,000美元。所以，加密资产并未以有意义的方式配合市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: I mean, basically, you're seeing a lot of these assets either end green or end slightly green or end slightly red, which is not the worst thing in the world. S&P just going red right there, but still above 670. BMR wreck today down 6.3%. Why Ethereum right there at 3100, that's down 1%. Bitcoin as well did get back to 97 right back to 94 over the past 30 minutes. So, crypto assets really have not been cooperating in a meaningful way.</p>
</details>

Amit: 尽管我们在收盘时有所回落，但全天没有出现大幅度的下行震荡。不过，我们也没有看到大规模的反弹至历史新高。我认为，从盘前低点开始的复苏是稳定了许多投资组合当天表现的上涨，并可能消除了许多追加保证金通知和止损单等。但尽管如此，对大多数人来说，今天和本周仍然是艰难的一天和一周。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: We didn't get a big whipsaw to the downside throughout the day even if we are kind of going red towards the close. But we didn't get a massive massive massive whipsaw backside alltime highs. The recovery from the pre-market lows I think was the move higher that kind of stabilized a lot of portfolios for the day and potentially got rid of a lot of margin calls and stop losses etc. But nonetheless still an ugly day and ugly week across the board for most people.</p>
</details>

Amit: Robinhood股价123美元，Rocket Lab股价45.27美元。我们有很多宏观方面的事情要谈，有很多不同的头条新闻要讨论。下午4:30会有一家初创公司加入节目，我们将听到一些加密金融生态系统中的新产品。首先，我们有Tom Lee。让我们听听他要说什么，然后我们再继续。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Robin right there 123 Rock Lab at 4527. We got a lot of macro stuff to get into, a lot of different headlines to talk about. We'll be having a startup join the show at 4:30 and we'll get to hear from some of the new products that are out there in the crypto financial ecosystem. First off, we got Tom Lee. Let's hear what he has to say and then we will keep going from there.</p>
</details>

### Tom Lee解读：加密货币去杠杆与市场前景

Scott: 他也是Bitmine的主席。很高兴你能来。以太坊本周下跌了8.5%，比特币下跌了8%，Bitmine下跌了20%。这里发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Scott: >> Also the chairman of Bitmine. So, it's good to have you. Um, Ether's down eight and a half% this week. Bitcoin's down eight. Bit mine is down 20. What's happening here,</p>
</details>

Tom Lee: Scott，我认为我们仍在看到4月10日那次加密货币去杠杆事件的后续影响。你知道，那是史上最大规模的去杠杆事件。我认为，现在仍有一些做市商面临资产负债表问题，正在努力筹集资金。所以我认为这导致了市场的一种……你知道，每当我们稍有反弹，就会有资金试图被筹集。我认为这就是目前压制加密货币的原因。当然，这种情况很快就会结束。但我认为这就是自10月10日以来加密货币表现不及股票的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tom Lee: >> Scott? I think we're still seeing the repercussions of that April 10th crypto deleveraging event. You know, it was the biggest deleveraging event ever. And there are still, I think, some market makers that have some balance sheet issues that are trying to raise capital. So, I think that this is leading to a market that is kind of raised. You know, every time we get a bit of a rally, there's some capital trying to be raised. And I think that's what's suppressing crypto for now. That's of course going to end soon. But I think that's led to why crypto has underperformed equities since October 10th.</p>
</details>

Scott: 像你们这样的加密金库（crypto treasuries）能否与加密货币本身同步交易，还是说一个的交易必须以另一个为代价？如果我看到资金流入比特币或加密金库，那这些资金不就得从纯粹的加密货币本身流出吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Scott: Can can crypto treasuries uh like yours for example, can they trade as well uh or in tandem with a cryptocurrency itself or does one have to trade at the expense of the other? If I'm going to see money flow into Bitcoin or crypto treasuries, wouldn't it then come out of the actual pure play coin itself?</p>
</details>

Tom Lee: 不完全是这样，Scott。例如，当Bitmine有股东并且机构资本流入时，你知道，像摩根大通、景顺、贝莱德这些公司购买大量股份，那么这些资本就会被用来购买以太坊。所以它实际上是回流到生态系统中，但随后进入了像Bitmine这样的工具，它实际上是一个永久持有者。你知道，Bitmine拥有350万以太坊，超过供应量的2.9%。但现在这些以太坊不会受到清算的影响，因为持有它们没有使用杠杆。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tom Lee: Uh not exactly, Scott. For instance, when Bitmine uh has shareholders and institutional capital comes in and you know JP Morgan, Invesco, Black Rockck are buying big stakes, then that capital is then used to buy Ethereum. So it's it's actually going back into the ecosystem, but then it's going into a vehicle like Bitmine that's actually a permanent holder. You know, Bitmine owns three and a half million Ethereum, more than 2.9% of the supply. But now that is not going to be subject to liquidations because there's no leverage used to hold that Ethereum.</p>
</details>

Tom Lee: 然后在某个时候，这360万或350万以太坊将被质押，然后产生近4亿美元的净收入。这可以为股东创造回报。所以，在某种程度上，加密金库实际上是一个非常有吸引力的股权投资，因为它有收入部分，当然还有增加每股以太坊持有量的能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tom Lee: And then at some point that 3.6 million or 3.5 million Ethereum is going to be staked and then generate, you know, nearly $400 million in net income. Well, that can create returns for shareholders. So, in a way, a crypto treasury is actually a a pretty attractive equity because there's a, you know, income component plus there's, of course, that ability to grow your Ethereum holdings per share.</p>
</details>

Scott: 但是，如果加密金库变得比加密货币本身更受青睐呢？如果只是更多的钱涌向金库这一部分，对以太坊或比特币的交易方式没有任何负面影响吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Scott: But, well, what if what if crypto treasuries become more favored than than crypto itself? There's there's no negative impact for either the way that Ether or Bitcoin would trade if just more money floods towards the Treasury part of the story.</p>
</details>

Tom Lee: 嗯，首先它是一个渠道，因为你知道，许多股票基金经理，4000家中的许多家，不能直接拥有加密货币。所以他们必须通过购买像Bitmine这样的股票来获得以太坊的敞口，而Bitmine如今是美国第438大股票。这与有人想投资能源领域没什么不同。他们可以购买石油并交易商品，或者在家里储存油桶，也可以购买与石油相关的股票，比如一家大型石油公司或供应链中的某个公司。这就是加密金库的本质，它基本上是一种让你直接接触加密资产的资产类别。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tom Lee: Well, one it's it's a conduit because as you know equity managers uh many of them the 4,000 can't own crypto directly. So that so they have to get exposure to Ethereum by buying a stock like Bitmine and Bitmine is the 438th largest stock in America today. It's not that different than if someone wanted to have exposure to energy. They can buy oil and trade a commodity or they can take like oil barrels at home or they can buy an oil related stock, you know, either a major or something in the supply chain. That's that's what crypto treasuries are is essentially an asset class that gives you direct exposure to the crypto asset.</p>
</details>

Scott: 好的，让我们转向市场本身。你对我们目前所处的位置以及你认为年底行情的前景，在经历了本周的情况后，信心是否有所动摇？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Scott: All right, let's pivot to the market itself. Um, is your confidence at all shaken in in where we are and what you thought the prospects for an endofear run could be after what we've seen this week?</p>
</details>

Tom Lee: 嗯，看到市场摇摆，以及像人工智能、量子和核能这样相当受欢迎的股票大幅下跌，从来都不是件愉快的事。但这与我们到10月份已经连续上涨了六个月的观点是一致的。所以市场处于超买状态。我们预计会有两周的盘整，而这正是我们正在经历的。然后，当然，如你所知，还有美联储的鹰派言论。所以市场有点发脾气。但从现在到年底，我们仍然有非常好的季节性因素。财报一直不错。情绪已经转为负面，Scott，你可以看出来。我的意思是，AI指数已经跌到了负17.5。所以我认为，到年底，股票的风险回报仍然非常好。是的，我认为标普指数到年底会超过7000点。你知道，事实上，也许到本月底就会超过7000点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tom Lee: Well, it's never fun to see markets um wobble and then stocks that are quite popular like AI and the quantum uh and nuclear come down so hard, but it is consistent with the idea that, you know, we were up six months through October. So, the market's overbought. We expected two weeks of consolidation, which is what we're getting. And then, of course, as you know, there's hawkish Fed talk. So, there's a bit of a tantrum the market's having. But between now and year end, we still have really good seasonals. The earnings have been good. Sentiment has flipped negative, Scott, as you could tell. I mean, the AI went to negative 17.5. So, I I'd say the riskreward is still really good for equities into year end. And yeah, I think the S&P will be over 7,000 by the end of the year. You know, in fact, maybe over 7,000 by the end of the month.</p>
</details>

Scott: 假设12月不降息现在是基本情况。而人工智能领域仍然波动。本周有时，市场普涨的交易看起来相当不错，我们当时在想，好吧，也许我们会迎来一轮全面上涨。你认为这可能吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Scott: >> No cut in December. Let's just say that that's the now the base case. Uh and AI remains volatile. you know, the broadening trade looked pretty good at times this week to where we were thinking of, okay, maybe we're going to get an everything rally. You think that's possible?</p>
</details>

Tom Lee: 嗯，是的。我的意思是，我认为美联储对12月降息态度退缩的一个原因，不是因为他们对通胀正在加强更有信心。事实上，你知道，他们中的许多人说他们只是不知道，但总的来说，他们同意通胀可能没有加强。我认为是有迹象表明劳动力市场可能正在稳定。所以你实际上看到美联储因为一个好的理由而摇摆不定，那就是，如果就业市场保持稳定，美联储就不必降息。这对股市来说仍然是一个好环境。我不是想粉饰太平，但如果美联储开始有第二种想法，这并不是一个坏理由。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tom Lee: >> Uh, yeah. I mean, I think one reason the the Fed is backpedaling on a cut in December is not because they have more confidence that inflation is uh strengthening. In fact, you know, many of them said they just don't know, but in general, they agree it's probably not. It's I think that there are signs that the labor market is maybe stabilizing. So you actually have a Fed waffling for the right reason, which is look, if the employment market's holding up, the Fed doesn't have to cut. That's still a good environment for equities. I'm not trying to like spin it, but it's not a bad reason if the Fed is starting to have second thoughts.</p>
</details>

Scott: 好的，Tom，我得就此打住了。我感谢你。我有一些新闻必须报道。我们很快再见。那是Tom Lee。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Scott: >> Okay, Tom, >> I got to leave it there. I I appreciate you. I've got some news that I have to get to though. I'll see you soon. That's Tom Lee.</p>
</details>

### 美联储立场转向：12月降息希望渺茫

Amit: 在这样的一天，老实说，他能说的话不多，无法减轻人们的担忧。我的意思是，看，BMR的股票在过去几周基本上已经死了。说真的，我认为除非以太坊有所行动，否则他说什么都没用。所以，你可以深入探讨数字资产金库的技术细节，解释所有的细微差别。在这样的一天，没人在乎。然后当你说到月底7000点时，我的意思是，如果真的发生了，我想我们都会很高兴。但显然，这有点难以置信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: We are now getting The thing on a day like this is, you know, honestly, there's just not much that he can say that's going to alleviate the concerns that people have. I mean, look, BMR stock has basically been dead over the past couple of weeks. Uh, really, literally, I don't think he can say anything unless Ethereum makes a move. So, you can go into the technicals of a digital asset treasury and explain all the nuances. No one cares on a day like this. And then when you say 7,000 end a month, I mean, again, [laughter] if it happens, I think we'd all be happy. But obviously, it's a little tough to believe.</p>
</details>

Amit: 难以置信的原因是，不幸的是，12月的降息看起来就是不会发生了。如果你看一下新的美联储对12月降息的概率，我们现在已经低于50%。随着比特币下跌，我们早上至少还有51%，现在是45%。根据我听到的消息，我们稍后会讨论一些头条新闻，你看到很多美联储主席都站出来表态。甚至美联储的洛根今天也说，对于12月的会议，很难支持再次降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: And the reason it's tough to believe is because unfortunately, um, this December rate cut is looking like it's just not going to happen. If you look at the new Fed probabilities for a December rate cut, we are now under 50%. As Bitcoin goes down, we were at least at 51 in the morning. We're at 45. Uh based on what I've been hearing and we we'll discuss some of the headlines, you just got a lot of Fed presidents that are coming out. Even Fed Logan today said for December meeting it would be hard to support another rate cut.</p>
</details>

Amit: 我的意思是，在这一点上，几乎就像美联储主席们聚在一起，决定单方面地改变他们对劳动力市场与通货膨胀的立场。关于通货膨胀确实存在合理的担忧，我不是说没有。但是，这几乎是与我们几周前听到的完全180度的转变，我认为这会惹恼很多人。其中之一就是总统，他非常需要这个可负担的经济，而利率下降将有助于实现这一点。但是，我不知道，如果非要我猜，我会说很难想象我们会得到那次降息，仅仅是基于美联储的言论。你需要有更一致的共识，而现在你没有看到这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: I mean, at this point, it's almost like the Fed presidents kind of came together and decided they would unilaterally start pivoting from their stance on the labor market versus inflation. There are legitimate concerns about inflation. Not saying that there's not. Uh but but the but it's almost a full 180 from what we heard a couple weeks ago and I think that's going to piss off a lot of people. One of those is the president who really needs this affordable economy and rates going lower would help to make it affordable. But I don't know gun to my head I would say it's tough to imagine we're going to get that rate cut just based on how the Fed's speaking. You got to have a little bit more unanimous consent and right now you're not seeing that.</p>
</details>

Amit: 特斯拉股价404美元，Robinhood守住122.60美元，英伟达仍在190美元。Palantir当天收绿，标普指数轻微下跌，Palantir股价173.93美元。你知道，这就是为什么我认为下周会非常有趣。显然我们有英伟达的财报。英伟达今天获得了一系列评级上调，我们早上谈到了一些。所有这些上调，美国银行的目标价275美元，摩根士丹利的目标价220美元，都基于合理的盈利预期，如果你展望一两年后去理解市盈率应该是什么样子。顺便说一下，恐惧与贪婪指数在23。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Tesla right there 404 Robin Hood holding 12260. Nvidia still holding 190. Uh, Palunteer is green on the day and the S&P slightly selling off pound right there 17393. And you know that is why I think that next week is going to be really interesting. Obviously we've got Nvidia earnings. Nvidia got a bunch of different upgrades today and we talked about some of those in the morning. All those upgrades, Bank of America 275, Morgan Stanley 220, all those upgrades are rooted in just reasonable earnings estimates if you go out a year or two to try to understand what the multiples should look like. Fear and greed by the way at 23.</p>
</details>

Amit: 问题是，即使英伟达公布了良好的预期，这就是为什么Tom最后说“我不是想粉饰”，但其核心他就是在粉饰，对吧？这种粉饰的说法是，即使美联储不降息，也没关系。而你粉饰的方式是说，如果美联储因为劳动力市场健康而不降息，那么盈利就足够好，这意味着我们技术上不需要降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: The problem is even if Nvidia puts up good estimates and that's why Tom at the end he said I'm not trying to spin it but at its core he was trying to spin it right and and the spin is that even if the Fed doesn't cut rates it's okay and the way you make the spin is by saying well if the Fed's not cutting because the labor market is healthy then earnings are good enough which means we don't technically need to cut.</p>
</details>

Amit: 问题在于，我认为没有人相信劳动力市场是健康的。所以如果劳动力市场不健康，而美联储又不降息，盈利就会下降，你也得不到美联储的任何货币宽松支持。所以这就像一个双重打击，可能会严重扰乱年底进入第四季度的市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: The problem is I don't think anyone believes the labor market is healthy. And so if the labor market's not healthy and the Fed's not cutting it, earnings will go down and you're not going to get any monetary easing support by the Fed. So it's it's like a double whammy that could really really mess up the end of year going into Q4.</p>
</details>

Amit: 现在，我们不知道情况会如何发展，也许Tom Lee是对的，劳动力市场足够强劲，美联储更担心通货膨胀。因此，盈利会很好，因为劳动力市场会自我维持，他们技术上不需要降息。但很难想象标普指数7000点没有计入另一次降息。我的意思是，真的很难相信我们能像他说的那样达到7000点而没有降息。我想你可能会认为需要一次降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Now, we don't know how that's going to play out and maybe Tom Lee is right that the labor market is strong enough and the Fed is more worried about inflation. Therefore, earnings will be fine because, you know, the labor market will sustain itself and they don't technically need to cut. But it's hard to imagine$7,000 on the S&P not pricing in another rate cut. I mean, it's really hard to believe we go to 7,000 as he said, and you don't get a cut. Like I would imagine you think you would need to get a cut.</p>
</details>

Amit: 所以对于每个说“劳动力市场下滑这么明显，为什么美联储没有认识到？”的人，我不知道。我真的不知道这周他们是怎么得出通胀比其他一切都重要的结论的。但这就是我们从美联储那里听到的言论，而美联储未来的概率现在正在大幅度地降低12月降息的可能性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: And so for everyone saying, "Well, it's so obvious that the labor market is down. Why isn't the Fed recognizing that?" I don't know. I [laughter] I just I have no idea this week how they came to the conclusion that inflation matters way more than everything else. But that is the Fed speak we're getting and the Fed future pro probabilities are now heavily discounting the ability for a December recup.</p>
</details>

Amit: 只要我们拿不到就业数据，劳动力市场就没问题。是的，完全正确。如果我们拿不到数据，那就太神奇了。我不知道。我们得看看下周会得到什么数据。我唯一能说的是，至少在临近收盘时我们出现了一波反弹，指数回到671点。我们早上讨论了很多关于这个牛市的结构性基本面，在AI交易方面是否不完整。答案是否定的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Labor market is fine as long as we don't get jobs data. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. It's amazing if we don't get the data. I don't know. We're going to have to see what we get going into next week. The one thing I can say is at least we are getting a rebound as we get into the close 671. We talked a lot about in the morning is the structural uh fundamentals of this bull market incomplete in regards to the AI trade. The answer is no.</p>
</details>

Amit: 我们确实有一些关于阿里巴巴和甲骨文在人工智能方面的更新，我们稍后会谈到，但我认为那不是我们抛售的原因。我认为过去几天我们抛售的原因，你知道我们现在的位置和几周前差不多，但我认为我们抛售的原因是围绕降息的不确定性。我不认为这与AI交易有任何关系。也许我错了，但我真的认为这与我们不知道是否会降息有关。如果我们不知道，那么市场就会感到害怕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: We do have some updates on AI in regards to Alibaba and Oracle that we'll talk about in a second, but that I I don't think that's the reason we sold off. I think the reason we sold off over the past couple days and you know we are relatively where we were a couple weeks ago, but the reason I think we sold off is because uh of this lack of certainty around a rate cut. I don't think it has anything to do with the AI trade. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think it really does have to do with we don't know if we're getting a rate cut.

Amit: 比特币价格94,000美元，临近收盘时出现了一根难看的K线。我们之前一个多小时都守在96,000美元。以太坊不知何故一直保持在3,000美元以上。你可能会想，今天有这么多的清算和杠杆，以太坊应该会在2800-2900美元左右震荡，但它没有。以太坊现在是3132美元。

<p class="english-text">Amit: Bitcoin right there, 94. Nasty candle as we get into the close. We were holding 96 for the better part of an hour. Ethereum has somehow stayed above 3,000. And you would imagine today with all the liquidations and leverage that Ethereum would have kind of chopped below around that 2829 level, but it did not. 3132 right there on Ethereum.</p>

Amit: 这就是我们今天的情况。好的，各位。这是艰难的一周，艰难的一天。但今天本可以更糟。所以你得心存感激。盘前市场比我们收盘时要糟糕得多。基本上，我们今天将以平盘收场，我认为在671点，任何人都会接受。但无论如何，我们正在结束11月的第二周。感谢大家来到这里。11月14日，星期五。股市现已收盘。

<p class="english-text">Amit: And that is what we got. All right, folks. Been an ugly week, ugly day. It It could have been a much uglier day. So, you got to have a bit of gratitude here. Pre-markets were way worse than what we are ending on. Basically, we're going to be ending flat on the day, which I think anyone would take at 671. But, nonetheless, we are closing out the second week of November. Thank you everybody for being here. Friday, November 14th. The stock market is now closed.</p>

Amit: 好的，我们今天以标普指数平盘收场，报671.96点。特斯拉收于404美元。特斯拉曾跌至382美元，所以收在400美元以上不是最坏的情况。Robinhood早上曾跌至110美元，收于122.50美元。英伟达收于190.17美元，上涨1.77%。Nebius收于83.54美元，这只股票从80美元低点反弹，但未能进入90美元区间。它曾尝试在89美元突破，但再次受阻。CoreWeave收于77.36美元。MP Materials收于58.61美元，上涨1.862%。Hims收于37.02美元，上涨2.69%。美光上涨4%。比特币94,400美元，以太坊3100美元。Rocket Lab收于45.54美元，曾尝试冲击48-49美元区间，但在那里遭到拒绝。所以是45.50美元。它在盘前曾跌至41美元区间。

Robin Hood got to 110 in the morning. 12250. Nvidia 190.17. That's up 1.77%. Nebas right there 8354. This one did bounce off the low 80s but did not get into that 90 level.

</details>

Amit: 英伟达收于190美元，我认为这更多是市场对即将到来的英伟达财报感到兴奋。对于英伟达的财报，有很多值得兴奋的地方，因为它是世界上最好的公司之一。问题只是在于，即使宏观环境不佳，它能否像几周前那样在五万亿美元市值范围内交易。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Amit: Uh Nvidia gets a 190 close. I think that's more of the market being excited about Nvidia um earnings that are coming up. And there's a lot to be excited about for Nvidia earnings because it's one of the best companies in the world. It's just a question of can it trade, you know, in that five trillion dollar market cap range like it did a couple weeks ago, even with the macro being off tilts.</p>

Amit: Oklo收盘价低于100美元。量子计算公司D-Wave当天收盘时实际上是上涨的。这些股票在盘前都下跌了10%。IonQ当天上涨4%。Rigetti当天上涨1.1%。BMR下跌约5.8%。比特币94,000美元。然后是Palantir，当天收绿于174美元。

### 关键地缘政治新闻：阿里巴巴与英伟达的中国困境

Amit: 好的，让我们来看一些头条新闻，因为有很多不同的新闻正在爆出。首先，让我们看看今天关于阿里巴巴的头条新闻，因为这则新闻相当奇怪，但它确实让阿里巴巴的股价下跌了几个百分点。让我快速调出这个新闻，然后我们继续。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: All right, let's get into some of these headlines because we have a bunch of different things that are breaking in terms of news. First of all, let's just look at the Alibaba headline that we had today because this was a pretty weird one, but it definitely took Alibaba stock down a couple percentage points. Let me pull this up real quick and then we will keep going from there.</p>
</details>

Amit: 这是公司所说的。他们说：“文章中的断言和影射完全是虚假的。我们质疑这篇匿名泄露背后的动机，金融时报也承认他们无法核实。这次恶意的公关操作显然来自一个企图破坏特朗普总统最近与中国达成的贸易协议的流氓声音。”这是阿里巴巴集团发言人的声明。所以Scott，公司对金融时报的报道做出了激进的回应，正如你提到的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: >> Here's what the company is saying. They say the assertions and innuendos in the article are completely false. We question the motivation behind the anonymous leak, which the FT admits that they cannot verify. This malicious PR operation clearly came from a rogue voice looking to undermine President Trump's recent trade deal with China. That's the statement uh attributable to an Alibaba group spokesperson. So Scott, an aggressive response here from the company to that report from the FT, which as you mentioned</p>
</details>

Amit: 那么，《金融时报》说了什么？一份白宫官方备忘录声称，阿里巴巴正在向中国军方提供技术，以打击美国目标。根据一份白宫国家安全备忘录中研究的情报，阿里巴巴为中国针对美国目标的军事行动提供技术支持，这引发了对这家科技巨头的担忧。当然，阿里巴巴今天表示这是假的。提供给《金融时报》的官方备忘录包括解密的绝密情报，内容涉及这家中国集团如何向**中国人民解放军**（People's Liberation Army: 中国的国家武装力量）提供白宫认为会威胁美国安全的能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: >> now again, what did the FT say? Official White House memo claims Alibaba is supplying Chinese military with tech to target the United States. Alibaba provides tech support for Chinese military operations against targets in the US according to intelligence studied in a White House national security memo raising concerns about the technology giant. Obviously, Baba was saying that's false today. The official memo provided to the Financial Times includes declassified top secret intelligence on how the Chinese group supplies the People's Liberation Army with capabilities that the White House believes would threaten US security.</p>
</details>

Amit: 当我看到这个标题时，坦白说，我的反应是，“好吧，中国的科技公司不向中国军方提供打击美国的能力，这个想法……”我有点不觉得这是什么大新闻。就好像，他们当然会这么做。我认为人们对此没什么疑问。但阿里巴巴股价确实下跌了3.5%，消息一出就跌了大约2.3%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: When I saw this headline, quite frankly, I was like, "Okay, I [laughter] was like, the idea that the tech companies in China are not supplying the Chinese military with the capabilities to target the US." I I kind of didn't think it was that much of a story to be honest. It's like, of course, they are. Like, there there was really no doubt that I think people thought that was going to happen. But Baba did fall three and a half% and about 2.3% as soon as that news came out.</p>
</details>

Amit: 这件事更深远的影响实际上在于英伟达。原因在于，看，黄仁勋有一个梦想，那就是如果白宫允许他向中国销售，他就能从中国获得500到700亿美元的**潜在市场总额**（Total Addressable Market, TAM: 指一款产品或服务在特定市场中的总收入机会）。我的意思是，如果白宫的备忘录声称阿里巴巴在帮助中国军方打击目标，我完全不认为特朗普会说：“哦，是的，英伟达，把你的芯片卖给阿里巴巴吧，他们正好可以用这些最好的芯片来打击美国。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: The bigger implication from this realistically is on Nvidia. And the reason it's on Nvidia is because look, Jensen has this dream of, you know, getting that 50 to70 billion dollar TAM from China if the White House lets him sell into China. I mean, if the White House memo is claiming that Baba's helping Chinese military targets, there is no way that I think Trump's going to be like, "Oh yeah, Nvidia, sell your chips to BABA that's just going to use those chips, the best version of those chips to then target the United States."</p>
</details>

Amit: 所以，我认为我们极不可能看到英伟达在中国的收入恢复。似乎所有华尔街分析师对此都不太在意。黄仁勋表示国内需求如此之大，以至于这并不重要，但是，这类报道越多，我们获得中国需求的可能性就越小。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: So, I think it's very, very unlikely that we are going to get Nvidia revenue coming back to China. It seems like all the street analysts kind of don't care about that. And Jensen is stating so much domestic demand that it doesn't really matter, but um you know, more and more of these stories makes it unlikely that we're going to get that Chinese demand.</p>
</details>

### 13F报告揭秘：巴菲特巨资入股谷歌

Amit: 我们确实有一些**13F报告**（Form 13F: 美国证券交易委员会(SEC)要求管理资产超过1亿美元的机构投资经理每季度提交的持仓报告）。Druckenmiller，这是他的操作。新建仓了亚马逊、Meta和Chipotle。亚马逊、Meta和Chipotle是Druckenmiller新增的仓位。前五大买入是亚马逊、Meta、StubHub和围绕比特币的银行公司Figure。然后前五大卖出包括礼来和微软。再次强调，新建仓亚马逊和Meta。他退出了高盛和微软。退出了高盛和微软。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Uh we do have some 13Fs. Draen Miller, here's what he did. New positions in Amazon, Meta, and Chipotle. Amazon, Meta, and Chipotle. New positions is what Draen Miller added. Top five buys were Amazon, Meta, StubHub, and Figure, the banking company around Bitcoin. And then top five sales included Eli Lily and Microsoft. New positions again, Amazon and Meta. He exited Goldman Sachs and Microsoft. Exited Goldman Sachs and Microsoft.</p>
</details>

Amit: 我还没看到英伟达的13F报告，各位。让我看看是否能找到，如果已经披露的话。还有几家尚未披露，包括Altimeter。应该马上就会出来。所以应该随时都会出来。然后我们就能看到英伟达的持股情况。但这是我们从Stanley Druckenmiller那里得到的信息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: I don't see Nvidia's 13F yet, guys. Let me see if I can pull it up if it is disclosed. There's a couple that still haven't been disclosed, including Altimters. Um it should be coming out like now. So it should be coming out any second. Then we'll see what Nvidia has um in terms of their stakes. But this is what we have from Stanley Duck Miller.</p>
</details>

Amit: 在Stanley之后，是我们来自Tiger Global的老朋友Chase Coleman。他没有卖掉任何Graph的股票，他持有9200万股，没有动这些仓位。他确实增持了Netflix、MongoDB、Crowdstrike、礼来和诺和诺德。所以他增持了这些新仓位。再次强调，Tiger Global的Chase Coleman，管理着大约320亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Then after Stanley, you have our boy Chase Coleman from Tiger Global. Um he did not sell any of his graph. He has 92 million shares. Did not touch those positions. He did add Netflix, MongoDB, Crowdstrike, Eli Liy, and Novo. So, he did add those new positions. Again, Tiger Global, Chase Coleman about $ 32 billion.</p>
</details>

Amit: 正如我们在这里看到的，他增持了3%的亚马逊，减持了62%的Meta，减持了24%的Reddit，增持了Broadcom，增持了Flutter，增持了GE Veronova。他买了20.1万股Netflix，买了34万股MongoDB，卖掉了72%的Sherwin Williams，卖掉了22%的Zillow。他买了Bullish，Kathy也很喜欢那只股票。他买了Figure，这是继Stanley Ducken Miller之后又一个喜欢Figure的人。他买了17.5万股Klarna。他买了6万股Figma。这些是他投资组合中的一些主要买入。他保留了所有Weeble的股票，他有1100万股Weeble，还有1100万股New Bank。没有减持任何这些仓位。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Amit: As we can see right here, he added 3% to Amazon, reduced Meta by 62%, reduced Reddit by 24%, added to Broadcom, added to Flutter, added to GE Veronova. Uh, he bought Netflix 201,000 shares, bought MongoDB, 340,000 shares, sold 72% of Sherwin Williams, sold 22% of Zillow. Uh, bought Bullish, Kathy likes that one as well. Bought Figure, another person that likes Figure along with Stanley Ducken Miller. Bought Clara, 175,000 shares. He bought Figma, 60,000 shares. And those were some of the main buys that he had on his portfolio. He kept all of his Weeble. He has 11 million shares of Weeble, and he has 11 million shares of New Bank. Did not trim any of those positions.</p>
</details>

Amit: UNH。他持有UNH吗？是的，他保留了他的UNH仓位。43.8万股UNH。所以，这就是你从这些13F报告中得到的信息。英伟达的报告应该很快就会出来。还有，Altimeter的13F报告也应该很快出来。然后我们就能看到他们做了什么。是的，Altimeter的报告还没出来。Palantir股价174美元，标普500指数671.91点，盘后仍然持平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: UNH. Is he in UNH? Yeah, he kept his UNH. 438,000 shares for UNH as well. So, that's what you have from some of these 13Fs. And Nvidia should be coming out soon. Also, Altimter's 13F should be coming out soon. And um we'll be able to see what they did. Yeah, still not out yet for Altimter. Still not out yet for Altimter. pounder right at there 174 S&P 500 67191 and that one still flat after hours.</p>
</details>

Amit: 好的，甲骨文。甲骨文有什么大新闻？我们需要看Triple V的13F报告。你知道，他有时持有的股份大到必须向SEC正式披露。所以他肯定有过那样的时刻。甲骨文。好的，甲骨文怎么了？甲骨文的债务出了一些问题。我们谈过这个，这可能是我们临近收盘时出现一些抛售的另一个原因。顺便说一下，谷歌在德克萨斯州投资400亿美元建设数据中心。这个头条新闻刚刚出来。谷歌盘后因此上涨了吗？是的，谷歌上涨了2%。是这个原因吗？肯定还有别的原因。肯定还有别的原因。400亿美元的数据中心投资不可能让股价上涨2%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Okay, Oracle. So, what was the big news on Oracle? We need to see Triple V's 13F. You know, he's he's he's taken stakes sometimes where he actually had to legit disclose with the SEC. So, he's definitely had those moments. Um Oracle. Okay, so what's going on with Oracle? Uh Oracle's debt is having some issue. We talked about this and this is another reason probably we had a bit of a sell-off into the close. By the way, Google investing 40 billion in data centers in Texas. That headline just came out right now. Is Google moving after hours on this. Google's Yeah, Google's up 2%. Is this the reason? There's got to be something else. There's got to be something else. 40 billion in data centers can't be up 2%.</p>
</details>

Amit: 而且，这个消息是在收盘前不久出来的，所以我怀疑这不是我们上涨的原因。让我看看。也许有某个非常有影响力的人入股了谷歌。真的是那400亿吗？这真的是原因吗？它因为400亿的投资而上涨？我的意思是，那是他们在花钱。首先，这对AI交易非常利好，因为谷歌在花400亿。但为什么股票会因为他们花钱而上涨2%？事实上，如果他们需要发行一些债务来支付这笔钱，我们不知道，但如果他们这样做了，你会得到相反的反应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Also, that news came out right before the close, so I doubt that's the reason why we're pumping. Let's see. Did some Maybe someone took a stake in Google that's highly influential. Is there really the 40 billion? Could that really be the reason? Could that really be the reason why it's pumped at 40 billion for I mean, that's them spending money. First of all, super bullish for the AI trade because Google is spending 40 billion. But why would the stock go up 2% on them spending money? In fact, if they have to issue some debt to spend that money, which we don't know, but if they did, you would get the opposite reaction.</p>
</details>

Amit: 是的。我完全不知道。我不知道为什么谷歌会这样。我的意思是，难道是伯克希尔买了谷歌之类的？看到谷歌因为这个消息飙升真是奇怪。而且还在维持涨势。仍然上涨2%。Irene盘后也涨了一点。Nebius盘后也涨了。我的意思是，所有数据中心相关的股票都因为他们要花更多钱在数据中心上的消息而涨了一点。他们可能会把那400亿的一部分外包给这些其他公司。Druckenmiller没有买谷歌。从我看到的情况来看没有。如果伯克希尔买了谷歌，那将是相当疯狂的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Yeah. I have no idea. I have no idea why Google's there. Uh there's I mean, did did Birkshshire buy Google or something? That's that is weird to see Google spike on that. Still holding the spike, too. Still holding 2%. Irene after hours up a little bit. Nebius after hours up. I mean, all the data center plays up a little bit on the headline that they're spending more on data centers. They're probably going to outsource some of that 40 billion to these other players. Dracon Miller didn't buy Google. Not from what I see. If Birkshar brought Google, that would be pretty wild.</p>
</details>

Amit: Gemini。是的，但Gemini 3是有点旧的新闻了。我不知道这是否足以让它在周五盘后上涨。是伯克希尔吗？等等。我正在确认是不是伯克希尔。这也可能是假的。有很多人在说假话。我看到一张截图。不知道是否准确。我的意思是，它看起来很准确，但我可能完全错了。等等。是巴菲特买的伯克希尔吗？等等。我得自己确认一下。我拿到了持仓报告。让我看看。增持了。我得看看。如果他真的买了，那将是一个根本性的转变。新仓位。巴菲特。他增持了谷歌。他增持了1700万股谷歌。我的天哪。巴菲特进场了。伯克希尔进场了，1700万股谷歌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Gemini. Yeah, but Gemini 3 is a bit older news. I don't know if that's enough to pump it after hours on a Friday. Is it Birkshar? Hold on. I'm trying to confirm if it's Birkshshire. This could also be fake. Have a lot of people saying fake stuff. I see one screenshot. Do not know if that's accurate. I mean, it looks accurate, but I could be dead wrong. Hold on. Is it Buffett by Berkshire? Hold on. Uh, I have to confirm for myself. I got Okay, hold on. I got the holdings. Let me see. Added.

</details>

Amit: 天哪。伯克希尔现在开始拥抱科技了吗？哇。你可能会觉得谷歌应该涨得更多。伙计，如果这不是一个糟糕的一周，谷歌现在可能已经涨了7%了。这可是伯克希尔·哈撒韦。即使巴菲特不再管理它，伯克希尔这个品牌入股你的公司，其影响也是巨大的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Amit: [laughter] Holy crap. Is Birkshshire embracing technology now? Whoa. You would think Google would be up a lot more. Dude, if this wasn't a crappy week, Google would be up like 7% right now. Like this is Birkshar freaking Hathaway. the implications even if Buffett's not running it anymore of the brand of Birkshshire taking a stake in your company.</p>
</details>

Amit: 这是第三季度，对吧？所以他们的平均价格，我的意思是，我们还不知道，但很可能低于200美元。肯定低于200美元。谷歌在那段时间的交易价格在150到180美元之间。肯定是。天哪。这意味着他们已经盈利了。他们已经在一个相当大的程度上盈利了。哇。

<p class="english-text">Amit: This was Q3, right? So, their average price, I mean, we don't know yet, but it's got it's probably below 200. It has to be below 200. Google was trading between 150 and 180 that whole time. It has to be. Damn. That means they're already up on it. They're already up in a in a sizable way. Wow.</p>
</details>

Amit: 我不知道这是Greg Abel的决定，还是巴菲特的决定，但伯克希尔买了1780万股。40亿美元。没错。40亿美元。我的天哪。是的，这是盘后交易。所以，很明显，在周一开盘时，你可能会看到谷歌有不同的反应。

Amit: 伙计，再说一次，这些人的股东大会能坐满整个体育场。人们是伯克希尔哲学的信徒。当他们进行一笔交易，当他们做某件事时，全球有成千上万，甚至数以百万计的人关注伯克希尔的一举一动，并且当他们建仓时，会非常认真地对待。谷歌刚刚得到的这种认可，我的意思是，桑达尔现在肯定很高兴。顺便说一下，你知道，他们会长期持有。我的意思是，我不认为他们投入40亿美元只是为了好玩。你可能会想，他们会长期持有这只股票。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Dude, again, the these guys fill out arenas for their shareholder meetings. Like people are disciples of the Birkshar philosophy. when they take a trade, when they do something, I mean, there's hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people globally that follow every single thing that Birkshshire does and they take them very seriously when they initiate a position. The type of validation that Google just got, I mean, Sundar has got to be Sundar's got to be pretty happy right now. And by the way, you know, they're going to hold it for a long time. I mean, I don't think they're putting in four billion just for the hell of it. You would imagine they're going to hold this bad boy for a long time.</p>
</details>

Amit: 不要相信那个243美元的平均成本。你不会从任何这些网站上得到最准确的预测。该季度于9月30日结束。在9月30日之前，谷歌的价格有超过243美元，甚至超过200美元吗？我想是有的，但我怀疑他们是一次性买入的。9月30日。是的。好的。所以，谷歌在9月18日之前达到了250美元。所以他们可能是在7月到9月之间买入的。我的意思是，除非他们真的在9月底买入，否则他们的平均成本可能更接近190到200美元。但我们会随着时间的推移找到答案。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Amit: 1.7 29%. Don't believe the 243 average cost. You're not going to get the most accurate predictions from any of these websites. The quarter ended uh um what September 30th. Was Google above 243 before September 30th or even above 200? I think it was, but I doubt they bought all at once. September 30th. Yeah. Okay. So, Google got to 250 by September 18. So, they could have bought between July and September. I mean, unless they bought literally at the end of September, then they probably have an average closer to like 190 to 200. But, we'll find out over time.</p>
</details>

Amit: 市场价值是下一个。是的，但市场价值只是基于当前价格。它不是基于他们的平均成本。而且，这些网站，他们从不需要披露平均成本。所以，这些网站，你不能相信它们。我的意思是，我以前试过从这些网站计算平均成本。他们没有那个数据。他们有持仓和股数。他们不能给你确切的价格。当伯克希尔的8K报告出来以及所有那些东西出来后，你才能更好地了解他们实际支付的价格。

<details>

And also, these websites, they they never have to disclose the average. So, these websites, you can't trust them. I mean, I've tried calculating the average from these websites before. They don't have that. They have the position and they have the number of shares. They can't actually give you the exact price. When Birkshshire's 8K comes out and all that stuff, then you get a much better understanding of like the actual price they paid.</p>

Amit: 天哪，兄弟。1800万股谷歌。我不知道新领导层未来10年的理念会是什么。但Greg Abel，他多大了？Greg Abel的年龄，他是63岁。我的意思是，巴菲特大概95岁了吧？如果Greg未来25年都这么做，我的意思是，你认为他买50亿的谷歌是为了明天就卖掉吗？我的意思是，他们可能认为这里有他们必须长期认真投入的东西。

Amit: UNH，巴菲特没有卖出或买入，持有500万股UNH。他们保留了仓位。亚马逊，他们也保留了。亚马逊是前段时间买的。我将会非常感兴趣地听他们如何为购买谷歌辩护。我的意思是，他们将不得不谈论技术的影响，可能还有人工智能。我想他们将不得不谈论为什么人工智能对经济很重要，以及为什么谷歌是他们押注的选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: UNH, Buffett did not sell or buy 5 million shares of UNH. 5 million shares of UNH. They did not sell or buy. They kept it. Amazon, they kept it as well. Amazon was a while ago. I I am going to be very interested to hear how they justify buying Google. I mean, they're going to have to speak to the implications of technology and probably AI. I would imagine they're going to have to talk about why AI matters for the economy and why Google is their bet to play it.</p>
</details>

Amit: 哇。恭喜所有今年重仓谷歌的人。你们现在得到了史上最伟大的投资公司之一的深度认可，他们说正在入股谷歌。我的意思是，如果宏观环境不像现在这么不稳定，这只股票的涨幅会大得多。还有，我的意思是，巴菲特一直持有大量现金。所以，你告诉我，他们第一次决定动用他们3500亿美元现金时，选择的是一家科技公司，这难道是看跌吗？

<details>

<p class="english-text">Amit: Wow. Congrats to everyone who's heavy in Google this year. You got some deep deep validation right now by one of the greatest investment firms of all time saying that they are taking a stake in Google. I mean, the stock would be up a lot more if I think the macro wasn't as wonky right now. Also, I mean, Buffett's been holding on to a lot of cash. So, you're telling me the first time where they decide to deploy their 350 billion of cash is a tech company, and that's bearish.</p>
</details>

Amit: 比如，他们不买科技公司。他们持有的国债比整个美联储还多。他们说，“嘿，我们想投资50亿美元。”然后他们选择了一家科技公司。他们没有选择卡夫亨氏。他们没有选择银行。他们选择了一家科技公司。这对科技股来说不像是利空，而且你甚至不能说谷歌贵，你真的不能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Like, they they don't buy tech companies. They're they're sitting on more treasuries than the entire Federal Reserve. They say, "Hey, we want to take a five billion stake." And they pick a tech company. They don't pick Craft Hind. They don't pick a bank. They pick a tech company. doesn't feel bearish for tech and you can't even say Google's expensive like you really can't.</p>
</details>

Amit: 所以他们采取这个立场相当不可思议，而且这验证了很多东西。我的意思是，如果巴菲特或者伯克希尔说我们喜欢谷歌，那就意味着他们喜欢人工智能，他们喜欢像谷歌这样的公司在人工智能上获得的估值，这意味着为什么市场要怀疑整个人工智能的本质。你可以怀疑其中的个别公司，但怀疑整个概念就有点奇怪了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: So it's quite incredible that they're taking this position and it is validating a lot. I mean if if Buffett is saying or Birkshar is saying we like Google that means they like AI they like the multiple that a company like Google is getting on AI which means why should the market be doubting the entire nature of AI. You could be doubting individual names in it but doubting the entire concept is a bit weird.</p>

### 市场风险观察：甲骨文的信用违约互换飙升

Amit: 在谷歌新闻之前，我本想谈论这个头条新闻。甲骨文的信用风险正在被重新定价。5年期**信用违约互换**（Credit Default Swap: 一种金融衍生品，允许投资者将其信用风险与另一位投资者进行交换或对冲）利差。我们昨天看了甲骨文的图表。它跳涨了13.5个基点，达到约102个基点。这是自2021年以来最大的变动，因为投资者正在对冲数百亿美元与数据中心相关的AI债务。摩根士丹利现在预计，到2028财年，数据中心建设的净债务将达到2900亿美元，而之前是1000亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Now, here was the headline I was going to talk about before the Google news. Oracle credit risk is getting repriced. 5-year credit default swap spreads. We looked at the chart yesterday on Oracle. It jumped 13.5 basis points to about 102 bips. The biggest move since 2021 as investors hedge tens of billions in AI related debt for data centers. Morgan Stanley is now seeing the net debt for data center buildout by fiscal year 2028 to 290 billion versus 100 billion.</p>
</details>

Amit: 2900亿美元相对于承诺投资于数据中心的数万亿美元来说仍然很小，但它更高了，这就是为什么人们购买这些信用违约互换来对冲债务走错方向的风险。所以这就是甲骨文的情况。再次强调，我认为这就是为什么在今天收盘时，随着围绕AI和数据中心的信用违约互换开始飙升，给更广泛的股票市场带来了很多恐惧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: 290 billion would still be small relative to the the many trillions that have been pledged to be invested in data centers, but it is higher, which is why you've got people purchasing these credit default swaps to hedge against that debt going the wrong way. So that's what you got on Oracle. And again, I think that's why it was creating a lot of just like uh fear for the broader equity markets towards the end of the day as those credit default swaps started spiking around AI and data centers.</p>
</details>

### 更多巨头动向：Altimeter与Coatue跟进入股谷歌

Amit: Bill Ackman刚刚发布了报告。让我们看看。顺便说一下，Bill Ackman在90美元时买了谷歌。所以他持有谷歌已经有一段时间了。好的。让我们看看。Bill Ackman卖了一点优步，卖了一点Brookfield，保留了谷歌。不，卖了10%的谷歌C类股，保留了谷歌A类股。这就是我的意思，伙计们。你们说他的平均成本是243美元。看看Bill Ackman报告的价格。它说是243美元。这没有任何意义。Bill Ackman从90美元就开始买谷歌了。所以你真的不能相信这些报告的价格来估计他们的平均成本。比如Bill Ackman的持股成本不是243美元。他根本没有在第二季度买入。所以不可能是243美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Bill Aman just came out. Let's see. Bill Aman, by the way, bought Google at 90 bucks. So, he's been in Googs for a while. Um, okay. Let's see. Bill Aman sold a little bit of Uber, sold a little bit of Brookfield, kept Google. No, sold 10% of Google Class C, kept Google Class A. And this is what I mean, guys. You guys are saying his average is 243. Look at the reported price on Bill Aman. It says 243. That doesn't make any sense. Bill Aman bought Google since $90. So, you really can't trust these reported prices to estimate their average. Like Bill Aman stake is not $243. Like he he he did not buy at all in Q2. So there's no way it's possible for it to be 243.</p>
</details>

Amit: Altimeter的报告出来了。我们有吗？好的，让我看看。Altimeter。好的，我们来了。让我们把它调出来。这是Brad Gerstner。让我们从新仓位开始。谷歌，31.3万股谷歌，166万股Jimmy（一家加密公司），96.9万股阿里巴巴，74.4万股Broadcom，25.8万股Synopsis，130万股拼多多，然后我不知道NTSK和PTRN是什么，但他也买了几十万股。哇。谷歌，Broadcom，阿里巴巴和拼多多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Altimter's out. Do we have it? All right, let me see. Altimeter. Okay, here we go. Let's pull it up. This is Brad Gersonner. Let's start off with new positions. Um, Google, [laughter] [gasps] 313,000 shares of Google, 1.6 6 million shares of Jimmy which is a crypto company 969,000 shares of Baba 744,000 shares of Broadcom 258,000 of Synopsis Pinu Duo 1.3 million and then I don't know what NTSK is and PTRN is but he bought a couple hundred thousand shares of those guys as well. Wow. Google, Broadcom, Baba and Pin Duo Duo,</p>
</details>

Amit: Ackman，Gerstner和巴菲特都在谷歌。他清仓了Coreweave 65万股，IoT 290万股，DataDog 88.1万股。他增持了亚马逊7.2万股，增持了ARM 16.4万股，增持了微软10.3万股，增持了台积电20.1万股。减持方面，他们卖了65万股Hood，这是合理的，他们在30美元买的。他们卖了1.1万股Meta，卖了8000股Mercado Libre，卖了400万股Confluent，卖了140万股Coupang，卖了89.1万股Instacart，卖了60万股英伟达，还剩下766万股，但他们确实减持了。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Amit: Aman, Gersner and Buffett all in Google closed out he sold Coreweave 650,000 shares IoT 2.9 million shares data dog 881,000 uh added to he added to Amazon 72,000 shares added to ARM 164,000 added to Microsoft 103 3,000 added to TSM 200 1,000 no change or reduced let's do reduced reduced they sold 650,000 shares of Hood which is reasonable they bought it at 30 bucks uh they sold 11,000 shares of Meta sold 8,000 shares of Mardo Libre sold 4 million shares of Confluent sold 1.4 million shares of coupon sold 891,000 shares of Instacart sold 600,000 shares of Nvidia still have 7.6 6 million left, but they did trim.</p>
</details>

Amit: 卖出Hood是正常的。我的意思是，他们在40美元买的，现在涨了三倍。他们可能会获利了结。Meta。Gerstner持有Meta很长时间了。仍然持有180万股。所以这并不是一个大仓位。英伟达也不是什么大问题。他们持有14亿美元的英伟达。对他们来说是不错的仓位。Uber和Snowflake的卖出更激进一些。Zillow也更激进。然后是Instacart和Confluent。Confluent是最大的卖出，大约减少了420万股。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Selling Hood normal. I mean, they bought it at 40. It's up triple. They were probably going to take some profits. Meta. Gersonner has been in Meta for a long time. Still has 1.8 million shares. So, it's not like it's not a large position. Nvidia also not that big of a deal. They have $1.4 billion of Nvidia. Decent position for them. Uber and Snowflake a bit more aggressive on the sales. Zillow a bit more aggressive as well. And then Instacart and Confluent. Confluent the big one about 4.2 million down.</p>
</details>

Amit: 所以最大的新闻是每个人都爱上了谷歌。伙计，桑达尔现在肯定感觉自己是个人物了。谷歌因为这个消息涨得更多了吗？它只是因为今天是糟糕的一天或一周才持平。如果这是四周前，这个消息出来，你可以说谷歌现在已经超过300美元了。伙计，这可是天大的新闻。

</details>

Amit: Coatue Management，我们有他们的13F报告。最大的买入是谷歌。等等，让我把这个调出来。最大的买入是谷歌吗？让我看看。持仓。Coatue是一家相对较大的公司。哇。他们增持了200万股谷歌。我的天哪，伙计。209.1万股谷歌。他们增持了Figma。他们增持了应用材料、KLA、Snowflake和Synopsis。伙计，为什么每个人都喜欢Synopsis？我一直看到这个名字出现。

Dude, why does everyone like Synopsis? I keep seeing this name pop up.</p>

Amit: 他们卖掉了所有礼来的股票。他们卖掉了所有Yum China的股票。那是一个中国食品品牌。还有PM、GRNC和LX。增持了什么？他们增持了Marvell。他们增持了Weeble。他们增持了Trade Desk。他们增持了Spotify。他们增持了Oracle。增持了Meta、微软、阿里巴巴，他们增持了110万股。他们增持了iBit，增持了Enphase、DoorDash、Carvana、Broadcom、Applovin，然后他们继续增持谷歌。那是另一个谷歌C类股。所以他们现在两种都有。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Amit: Let's see what they closed out. Uh, they sold all their Lily. They sold all their Yum. That's a Chinese food brand. PM, GRNC, and then LX. What about added to?

Uh they added to iBit, they added to Nphase, Door Dash, Carvana, Broadcom, Applovin, and then they continue to add to Google. That was the other Google class C. So they have both versions now.</p>
</details>

Amit: 减持方面，他们卖掉了30.7万股特斯拉。他们卖掉了12.1万股GE Veranova。他们卖掉了160万股英伟达。卖掉了110万股New Bank。他们卖掉了150万股KKR。这真是太不可思议了，伙计。这真的太不可思议了。我的意思是，再次强调，购买谷歌是对这个更广泛的AI交易的强烈认可，如果你持有其他AI概念股，即使你没有持有谷歌，这也至关重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: Uh and then reduced, they sold 307,000 shares of Tesla. They sold 121,000 shares of GE Veranova. They sold 1.6 million of Nvidia. sold 1.1 million of new bank. Uh Tanner, I'm sending you the link on Twitter. Um and then they they sold 1.5 million shares of KKR. This is quite incredible, dude. This really is quite incredible. I mean, and again, buying Google is heavy validation for just this broader AI trade, which matters if you're in a lot of the other AI names, even if you're not in Google.</p>

### 深度对话：Palantir的独特护城河与宏观经济隐忧

Tanner: Brad Gerstner、Warren Buffett和Coatue Management持有相同的仓位。成长型和价值型投资者都说桑达尔做得对。这怎么可能？你完全没料到巴菲特会这么做吧？你甚至想过他们会这么做吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tanner: >> Brad Gersonner, Warren Buffett, and Kotu management hold the same position. [laughter] You [snorts] got growth and value all saying Sundar is doing the right thing. How's this possible? Did Did you at all expect Buffett to Did you even think they would they would do this?</p>
</details>

Amit: 没有。不，我没想过。我的意思是，这并没有……你知道，UNH的投资很有道理，但这个……这个相当有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: >> No. >> No, I wasn't thinking about it. I mean, it didn't you know, the UNH play made a lot of sense, but this is this is quite interesting.</p>
</details>

Tanner: 所以你认为这是巴菲特的决定，还是你认为这是Greg Abel在公司内部发起的一场范式转变？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tanner: >> So do you think this is a Buffett decision or you think it's a paradigm shift that Greg Ael is initiating in the firm?</p>
</details>

Amit: 不，我不知道这是不是巴菲特的决定，但我确实认为，我一直认为搜索可能是史上最好的商业模式之一。利润率高得令人难以置信，而且他们在那里没有失去市场份额，并且从AI概览和AI模式中获得了相同的抽成率。这可能只是向他们证实了他们会继续存在，这个业务还会持续20年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: No, I don't know if it's a a Buffett decision, but um I do just think that I I've always thought this search is probably one of the best business models there's ever been. Um the the the margins are incredible and the fact that they're not losing uh market share there and they're getting the same take rate from AI overviews and AI mode. It probably just confirms to them that they're sticking around and this business is going to last another 20 years.</p>
</details>

Tanner: 伙计，这也是一笔重仓。400万股可不是开玩笑的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tanner: >> Dude, it's a heavy position, too. four million shares is not a not a a joke. Like</p>
</details>

Amit: 我认为这就像……就像你说的，这对整个市场都有好处。我认为这有点像是巴菲特的认可印章，说“嘿，这笔资本支出没问题”。你会认为他们会完全站在这个交易的另一边。所有这些支出的投资回报率在哪里？你知道，他们会是最质疑这种支出的人。但他们没有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: >> I dude I think that this is like like you said uh this is kind of good for the entire market. I think this is sort of the seal of approval from Buffett to say hey this capex spend is fine. You would think that they would be on the complete other side of this trade. Where's the ROI on all of this spend? You know that they would be the most uh like like they would question this type of spend. But they're not.</p>
</details>

Tanner: 我不知道，伙计。是的。好的。所以，当巴菲特买苹果的时候，我知道你知道这段历史，你知道，他们把苹果看作是消费硬件。他们从来没有真正称它为科技公司。他们很难说它是一家科技公司。他们说这是消费硬件。你认为他们对谷歌是否也运用了某种不一定本质上根植于技术的哲学，而是他们看到了投资的更大图景？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tanner: >> I don't know, man. It is. Okay. So, when Buffett bought Apple, and I know you know the history of this, you know, they thought of Apple as a consumer hardware. They never really called it a a tech company. They struggled to ever say it's a tech company. They said it's consumer hardware. Do you think there's some philosophy they're using on Google that is not necessarily intrinsically rooted in technology, but there's a bigger picture they're seeing to the investment?</p>
</details>

Amit: 我想知道他们关注了多久，因为伯克希尔·哈撒韦处于一个非常独特的境地，只有少数几家公司他们可以投资，并且能对他们的投资组合产生相当大的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amit: >> I wonder for how long cuz um Bergkshire Hathway is in in a pretty unique situation where there's only a handful of companies that they can even invest in that's going to make a sizable change in their portfolio."</p>
</details>

Tanner: 是的。所以，他们关注谷歌多少个季度，多少年了，一直没有下手，而在过去3个月里发生了什么改变了他们的想法，让他们说……老实说，也可能是权力交接给了格雷格，格雷格说：“嘿，你知道吗？我过去5年都想要这只股票。”所以，但这确实……这只股票进入投资组合的时机很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tanner: >> Yes. So, how long, how many quarters, how many years have they had their eyes on Google and not pulled the trigger and something that happened within the last 3 months had changed their mind to say and and honestly, it could be that the keys going over to Greg and Greg says, "Hey, you know what? I've I've wanted this name for the last 5 years." So, but it does uh it is interesting the timing of this name going into the portfolio.</p>

</details>

Steve: 最重要的是，Chamath对市场了如指掌。他比大多数人更了解私营公司。他比大多数人更了解科技公司。他帮助建立了Facebook的早期阶段。在过去的二十年里，他参与了如此多的科技公司，所以当他说Palantir没有任何竞争对手时，你必须非常认真地对待这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steve: The bottom line is Chamath has his ear to the ground. He knows more than most people about companies that are private. He knows more than most people about tech companies. He helped build in the early stages Facebook. He's been involved in so many tech companies over the past two decades that when he says Palanteer does not have any competitors, you have to take that very seriously.</p>
</details>

Amit: 是的。我的意思是，看，几年前当Karp说我们没有竞争对手时，我相信了他。很高兴看到Chamath也这么说，但就像当他说MongoDB有上万个版本时，我不是一个技术专家，但即使我也知道这一点，而且我甚至没有每天在公司环境中使用那些软件，但即使我从我做的基础研究中也知道，这些不同公司有很多不同的版本，而Palantir确实是独一无二的。

<p class="english-text">Amit: >> Yeah. I mean, look, I believed Karp a couple years ago when he said we don't have competitors. It's nice to see Chamat say that, but like when he says there's a trillion versions of MongoDB, I'm not a big tech guy and even I know that and I don't even engage with those softwares every day in some corporate setting, but even I know from the basic research I've done, there's a lot of different versions of these different companies, whereas Palanteer really is a one of one.</p>

<p class="english-text">Amit: >> So, so then the question is, okay, so if the Fed's not going to cut and we have more layoffs, you're saying 10% correction, 5 to 10% end of this year, then let's paint the bearish case. Fed doesn't cut 5% correction. We have layoffs and then a shutdown again on January 30th.</p>

Steve: 这个怎么样？谁在乎政府是否关门？我的意思是，显然，是的，我们希望人们能拿到工资。我不认为会有政府关门。更重要的是我们进入衰退，失业率继续上升。我更担心那个，因为你可能为第二、第三季度的衰退埋下伏笔，因为我们现在可能就身处其中而没有意识到。我的意思是，白宫自己都说第四季度的GDP可能会因为政府关门而减少2%。

<p class="english-text">Steve: >> How about this? Who cares if there's a shutdown or not? I mean, obviously, yes, we want people to get paid. I don't think there's going to be a shutdown. The bigger thing is we go into a recession and unemployment continues to go up. I'm more worried about that because you can set the stage for a recession in Q2, Q3 because we could be in one right now and not realize it. I mean, literally, the White House said Q4's GDP could be cut by 2%. Because the shutdown,</p>

Amit: 我们现在可能正处于衰退或衰退的开端。股市不是经济的指标。我不在乎任何人怎么说。

Steve: 是的。而且，我意思是，你甚至……你今天看市场了吗，还是你有点忙？

<p class="english-text">Steve: >> Yeah. And I mean, did you even did you look at the markets today or were you kind of busy?</p>

Amit: 不，我完全不知道发生了什么。

Steve: 嗯，所以我们收盘时略微上涨，但在盘前市场是一场血洗。

<p class="english-text">Steve: >> Well, so we ended slightly green, but it was a bloodbath in the pre-markets.</p>

Amit: 好的。大约30分钟内，市场就反转了。但我的天哪，在盘前市场，如果你醒来查看你的投资组合……反弹，老实说，没有任何头条新闻。我认为市场只是觉得，我们不能在没有理由的情况下再跌那么多了。但这并不能让我对下周感到那么有信心，除非我们在关税和利率问题上得到一些明确的信息。看，我们真的需要利率下降，我们需要进行更深入的对话，停止为失业率的走向争吵和抱怨。我们必须降低失业率。

<p class="english-text">Amit: >> Okay. And within about 30 minutes, it reversed. But my goodness, in the pre-markets, if you woke up and checked your portfoly bounce, to be honest, there was no headline. I think the markets were just like, we can't go that much lower off no reason. But it doesn't really make me that confident for next week unless we get some clarity around the tariff and interest rate issue. Look, we truly need rates to come down and we need to have a bigger conversation and stop bickering and complaining about where we go with unemployment. We have to get unemployment lower.</p>
