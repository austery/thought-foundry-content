title: 麦肯锡如何应对AI挑战并重塑咨询业
summary: 麦肯锡全球总裁**Bob Sternfelds**探讨了AI对咨询行业的影响及公司应对策略。他指出，AI不仅推动了客户端的巨大变革，也促使麦肯锡内部进行组织重塑，包括将员工与AI代理结合，并从纯粹的咨询模式转向以成果为导向的合作模式。访谈还深入讨论了麦肯锡在人才招聘、领导力培养方面的演变，以及如何从过去的争议中吸取教训，加强合规与客户筛选，以期在未来十年成为客户的“影响力伙伴”而非仅仅是顾问。

### 咨询业的未来：AI与市场价值

**Bob Sternfelds**: 这将是下一个发展阶段，几年前我们为客户做的一大堆事情，现在客户将能够自己完成。因此，当务之急是转向更复杂的问题。正如你所说，客户会为我们支付什么？他们会付钱给我们，让我们找到方法使他们的**市值**翻倍。除非我们遇到那些说“我不想让我的市值翻倍”的CEO，否则我认为总会有更复杂的问题和机会存在。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bob Sternfelds**: This is just going to be that next evolution of there'll be a whole bunch of things that a couple years ago we did for our clients that our clients will do for themselves. And the imperative will then be to move to the even more complicated questions. And to your point, what are what are clients going to pay us for? They're going to pay us to find ways to double their market cap. And until we get to CEOs who say, "I don't want to double my market cap," I think there'll always be a more complicated set of questions and opportunities out there.

**主持人**: 我现在和**麦肯锡**全球总裁**Bob Sternfelds**在一起。Bob，谢谢你和我们在一起。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So, I'm here with Bob Sternfelds, the global managing director of McKenzie. And Bob, thank you for being with us.

</details>

**Bob Sternfelds**: 噢，很高兴能来到这里。我很高兴能和你聊聊。我想从**麦肯锡**开始，它正在迎来，或者说已经迎来了**百年诞辰**。顺便说一句，**HBR**（《哈佛商业评论》）是103年。所以欢迎加入“百年俱乐部”。你如何总结公司百年的传承？**麦肯锡**在多大程度上创造了塑造商业世界的思想，或者说它在多大程度上是关于识别和建议来自其他地方的**最佳实践**？我想我会从我们工作方式的本质开始。我们的理念是，我们与客户共同创造，当我们表现最佳时，我们是在找出如何帮助客户达到他们无法独自达到的境界。因此，在某种程度上，关于“你是否创造了新颖的东西”或“你是否提供了最佳实践”的功劳观念，我们可能将其定义为我们与客户共同创造，帮助他们提出他们自己可能没有想到的东西，或者我们自己可能没有想到的东西。我们显然在**专有IP**上投入了大量资金。我们每年在**创新**、**新思想**、**新理念**上投入超过**十亿美元**。例如，**麦肯锡全球研究院**是我们独立的**研究智库**，但我们现在也创建了**麦肯锡健康研究院**。我认为，如果你审视他们的历史，其中很多都是**新颖的思维**。例如，最近对**全球资产负债表**的审视，以及从资产和负债的角度看世界如何。这不是一个最佳实践，而是一个新颖的思考。但同样，我们之所以保持全球化的运营模式，部分原因在于在更微观的层面，我们服务的客户不希望只了解他们特定国家的**前沿创新**。他们希望了解世界各地的创新，甚至跨行业的创新，这是我们模式的一部分。所以，如果我不得不猜测，我认为这大概各占一半：一部分是真正新颖的**共同创造**，另一部分是关于如何将世界各地的创新带给那些可能因其所处现实而无法接触到这些创新的客户。

**Bob Sternfelds**: Oh, it's great to be here. I'm excited to have a chat with you. So I want to start, McKenzie is turning, maybe has turned 100. HBR, by the way, we're 103. So welcome to the Century Club. You know how would you summarize the company's 100-year legacy? To what extent has McKenzie created the ideas that have shaped the business world or to what extent is it about identifying and suggesting best practices that come from elsewhere? I guess I would start with the nature of how we do our work. And the idea is, look, we co-create with our clients and when we're at our best, it's figuring out how do we help clients get to places they can't get to themselves. And so, the whole notion in some ways of credit of did you create something novel or did you, you know, best practice is a bit of a maybe the way we frame is we're co-creating with clients to help them come up with things that they may not have come up with themselves or we might not have come up with themselves. And, you know, we clearly invest a boatload in proprietary IP. We invest over a billion dollars a year in innovation, new thought, new ideas. McKenzie Global Institute, for example, which is a bit of our independent research tank, but we've now created Mackenzie Health Institute. I think if you do look at their history, a lot of that is novel thinking. You know, the most recent looking at a global balance sheet and kind of saying how's the world when you look at assets and liabilities. That's not a best practice. That's, you know, new new thought. But equally part of the reason we stay global as an operating model is then at the more micro levels, the clients that we serve don't want to understand what the leading edge innovation is in their particular country. They want to understand innovation around the world and perhaps even cross sector, and that is part of our model. So I'd probably say it's if I had to guess it's probably half half on this around where are there truly novel co-creation and where is this idea of figuring out how do you bring innovation around the world to clients who may not have access to that innovation based on their, you know, the reality that they're in.

### AI对麦肯锡业务的影响

**主持人**: 显然，**AI**是创新领域之一，我相信你一直在向公司提供关于如何适应**AI驱动世界**的建议。我想谈谈这一点，但我更感兴趣的是**麦肯锡**内部正在进行的讨论。**AI**在多大程度上改变了你们行业的经济状况、员工人数、定价、生产力？利润是在改善还是面临压力？你们公司内部关于**AI**的讨论是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So, one area of innovation obviously is AI and I'm sure you're advising companies all the time on how to adapt to an AIdriven world. I want to talk about that, but I I'm interested in the internal discussions that are happening at McKenzie about this. You know, to what extent is AI shifting the economics of your industry, headcount, pricing, productivity, you know, are margins improving? Are they under stress? I mean, how what are the internal conversations about AI for your business?

</details>

**Bob Sternfelds**: **AI**？我们根本没谈过这个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bob Sternfelds**: AI. We haven't talked about that at all.

</details>

**主持人**: 你应该谈谈，它真的很酷。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: No, you should. It's really cool.

</details>

**Bob Sternfelds**: 你能给我科普一下吗？不，我只是开玩笑。现在，在任何情境下，都很难不谈到某种形式的**AI**。我认为关于**AI**以及它如何影响**麦肯锡**的问题，有两方面。一方面是面向客户的，另一方面是它对**麦肯锡**自身的影响。我总结的方式是，这是一个独特的时刻，可以帮助我们所有客户利用这项技术重新构想自己，而为了做到这一点，我们必须重塑自己以提供这种服务。我可能会先谈谈我实际从世界各地、各行各业和各个地区客户那里听到的情况。我真正在会议室里听到了两件事：一方面，人们对这波**技术变革**的潜力抱有巨大信念，这包括从客户服务或后台流程等领域的巨大**生产力提升**，也包括增长方面的事情。如果你想想**药物研发**时间的大幅缩短，以及这对**寿命**和**生活**的实际意义，那就是**营收增长**。所以人们很兴奋，他们是信徒。但与此同时，在我与CEO们的对话中，他们经常会说：“嘿，**Bob**，我现在是听我的**CFO**（首席财务官）还是我的**CIO**（首席信息官）的？”我的**CFO**在我耳边说，我们花了很多钱在技术上，但尚未从企业层面看到价值。所以，我们真的需要走在**前沿**吗？为什么我们不能做**快速追随者**？让其他人搞清楚方向，然后我们再快速采纳，因为追随者比领导者效率高得多。而**CIO**则说：“你疯了吗？这是一个关键时刻，如果我们不领先，我们就会被颠覆。”我们花了很多时间来研究我们认为的答案。有趣的是，我知道我们花了很多时间谈论技术，但我们发现，一半甚至更多的**秘诀**是**组织变革**，而不是技术实施。这对于大型企业来说是如此。例如，在实施数据之后，你的**组织结构**会是什么样子？你是否可以拥有一个更扁平的组织，削减大量中间层，让你的组织运行得更快？当你考虑真正复杂的工作流程时，想想**抵押贷款流程**。它有所有这些步骤，**贷款发起**、**信用评分**、**收款**、**售后服务**等等。这些在银行里都是不同的部门。那么，如果你能通过**AI**真正实现这些，为什么还要有四五个部门来处理一个流程呢？你不能打破这些壁垒吗？所以我们花了很多时间思考的不仅是**战略**和如何实施，还有如何改变组织？如何重塑组织以实现价值？如果你能做到这一点，**CFO**和**CIO**就会突然达成一致。但我们发现这比人们想象的要困难，也需要更长的时间。所以我确实认为我们将处于这样一个时期，即企业正在从根本上改变自己。是的，潜力巨大，但实现它还需要一段时间。那么你就会说，这对**麦肯锡**意味着什么？这正是你提出问题的起点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bob Sternfelds**: AI. We haven't talked about that at all. No, you should. It's really cool. Can Can you educate me on it? No, I'm just kidding. I mean, it's hard to have a conversation in any context right now that doesn't link back to some form of AI. I think this question around AI and how it impacts McKenzie, there's kind of two sides of that coin. There's a client-facing side and then there's a what are the implications on McKenzie and kind of the way that I summarize it is there's a unique moment to help all of our clients reimagine themselves leveraging this technology and to be able to do that we have to rewire ourselves to be able to deliver that. And I may just start with a bit of what I'm actually hearing from clients around the world across all industries and across all geographies. And I really hear in the truth room maybe two things. On the one hand, an enormous belief in the potential for this wave of technological change, and that's everything from enormous productivity gains in areas like customer care or back office processes, but also to growth things. If you think about radically shortening the time of drug discovery and what that actually means for longevity and life, and that's topline growth. So folks are excited and they're believers. But at the same time, from the conversations that I have with CEOs, they'll often say, "Hey Bob, so do I listen to my CFO or my CIO right now?" My CFO is in my ear that we're spending a lot of money on technology, but we're not yet seeing enterprise level value from this. And so, do we really need to be at the cutting edge or why can't we be a fast follower? Let other folks figure out where this is and then we'll adopt quickly because it's a lot more efficient to be a follower than a leader. CIO is saying, "Are you crazy? This is one of those moments and if we're not in the lead, we're going to get disrupted." We spent a lot of time looking at at least what we think the answer is here. And it's interesting. I know we spent a lot of time talking about technology, but what we're finding is half, if not more, of the secret sauce is organizational change as opposed to technology implementation. This is for large large enterprise. And, you know, it's things like, well, what does your organization look like after you're implementing data? Could you have, for example, a much flatter organization that cuts out a lot of middle layers and makes your organization faster? When you think about really complicated workflows, think about a mortgage process. You got all these steps, origination, credit scoring, collection, after service, etc. Those are all departments in a bank. Well, why do you have four or five departments in a process if you can really enable this through AI? Can't you break those walls down? And so we're spending a lot of time thinking through not only what's the strategy and how do you implement, but how do you change the organization? How do you rewire the organization to realize the value? And if you can get that right, all of a sudden the CFO and the CIO are actually on the same page. But we're finding that's harder and it's taking longer than people thought. And so I do think we're going to be in this period where really enterprise fundamentally changing themselves. Yes, enormous potential. It's going to take a little while to get there. So then you kind of say, okay, what does that what does that mean for McKenzie? Which is I think where you you started the question, Audi.

### 麦肯锡的内部AI转型与商业模式演变

**Bob Sternfelds**: 这对我们来说意味着几件事。第一，我们正在将**AI**应用于自身。我经常被问到：**麦肯锡**有多大？你们雇佣了多少人？我现在几乎每个月都会更新这个数字，但我最新的答案是**六万人**，其中**四万是人类**，**两万是AI代理**。一年半前，这个数字是**三千个AI代理**。我最初以为要到**2030年**才能达到**一个人对应一个AI代理**，但我认为我们将在**18个月内**实现这个目标。我们将让每位员工都至少配备一个或多个**AI代理**。我们将拥有一支**人类与AI代理共存**的劳动力队伍。我们如何驾驭这种局面？这是我们正在内部构建的**资产**和**技术**的一部分。另一个重要部分是它如何改变我们的**商业模式**。我们越来越坚信，我们正在迅速从所谓的**纯粹咨询工作**（这是我们公司最初的很大一部分，一种**按服务收费**的模式）转向**以成果为导向**的模式。在这种模式下，我们会说：“让我们共同确定一个**商业案例**，我们将**担保**该商业案例的成果。”这使我们的利益与客户的利益更加一致，我认为这将是未来的方向。现在，**AI**会变得越来越好，对吧？我们仍处于**生成式AI**的早期阶段。如果技术能够继续**商品化**，甚至包括**麦肯锡**长期以来提供的**分析**和**洞察**，那么当客户可以自己完成大部分工作时，他们还会为我们支付什么呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bob Sternfelds**: And it means a couple things for us. One, we're applying this to ourselves, and I often get asked, how big is McKenzie? How many how many people do you do you employ? And I now update this almost every month, but my latest answer to you would be **60,000**, but it's **40,000 humans** and **20,000 agents**. And a little over a year and a half ago, that was **3,000 agents**. And I originally thought it was going to take us to **2030** to get to one agent per human. I think we're going to be there in **18 months**. And we'll have every employee enabled by at least one or more agents. And we're going to have a workforce that is human and agentic. And how do we how do we kind of navigate that? That's kind of one piece of of what are the assets and and technologies that we're building in ourselves. The other big piece is how does it change our model? We're coming around to the conviction that we're migrating pretty quickly away from let's call it pure advisory work which was a lot of the origins of our firm and kind of a fee for service model etc. And what's it moving to? It's moving to much more of an outcomes-based model where we say look let's identify a joint business case together and we will underwrite the outcomes of that of that business case and it aligns our interests with our clients a lot more and I think will be the way of the future. Now, I mean, AI is is going to get better, right? We're still in the early early phases of generative AI. You know, if if technology can continue to commoditize, you know, even the kinds of analysis and insight that, you know, a McKenzie has long provided, you know, what what will clients actually be pay be paying for when they can probably do a lot of that themselves?

</details>

**主持人**: 在过去的一百年里，我们与客户共同解决的问题并非一成不变。它们发生了根本性的变化。即使是我，现在在我们公司里也被认为是“老古董”了，因为我已经和公司在一起超过30年了。但32年前我刚加入时作为助理所做的工作，我们现在根本不会考虑去做。为什么？因为客户现在可以自己完成那些工作。我们现在与客户一起解决的是更复杂、更相互关联的问题。我认为这意味着，这将是下一个发展阶段。几年前我们为客户做的一大堆事情，现在客户将能够自己完成。因此，当务之急是转向更复杂的问题。正如你所说，客户会为我们支付什么？他们会付钱给我们，让我们找到方法使他们的**市值**翻倍。除非我们遇到那些说“我不想让我的市值翻倍”的CEO，否则我认为总会有更复杂的问题和机会存在。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: The kind of problems that we have tackled with our clients over a hundred years has not been static. It has changed radically and even, you know, I'm now considered a dinosaur in our firm because I'm a little over 30 years with us, but the stuff that I did when I joined as an associate 32 years ago, we wouldn't consider even doing right now. Why? Because clients do that stuff themselves. And we are solving much more complicated interconnected questions with our clients. And I think what this is going to then mean is this is just going to be that next evolution of there'll be a whole bunch of things that a couple years ago we did for our clients that our clients will do for themselves. And the imperative will then be to move to the even more complicated questions. And to your point, what are what are clients going to pay us for? They're going to pay us to find ways to double their market cap. And until we get to CEOs who say, "I don't want to double my market cap," I think there'll always be a more complicated set of questions and opportunities out there.

### 管理咨询顾问的技能演变

**主持人**: 那么，**管理咨询顾问**的技能画像将如何演变？你们正在寻找什么？你们现在知道了吗？我的意思是，你们在招聘新人时看重什么？这肯定变化得很快。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What is the evolving skills profile then of a of a management consultant? You know, what are you and do you even know yet? I mean, what what are you looking for in new hires? And that must be evolving pretty quickly.

</details>

**Bob Sternfelds**: 我可以从我们现在确信的一些事情，以及我们正在探索的一些事情来阐述。四年多前我刚担任这个职位时，我问我们的**人才吸引团队**：“我们在吸引人才方面做得怎么样？”他们回答说：“**Bob**，我们做得很好，我们做得很好。”我问：“为什么？”他们说：“嗯，我们每年收到超过**一百万份申请**，我们雇佣**八千到一万人**。即使是这一百万份申请，也不是正态分布，对吧？其中有一些是世界上最聪明的人才。所以，实际上有什么问题呢？你为什么要问我？让我回去做我的工作吧。”我一直追问这个问题：“我们到底在寻找多少种人才画像？我们系统性地排除了哪些人？”结果发现，在全球范围内，真正能让你进入**麦肯锡**的途径只有**500种**。这与我们自己的**组织研究**结果不符，该研究表明**技能的半衰期**正在缩短，人们过于关注**纸面资质**，你是否有正确的**证书**。所以我们实际上对自身进行了**分析**，并使用了过去**20年**的数据，来确定哪些技能和特质最有可能让一个人在**麦肯锡**成为**合伙人**，因为这虽然不完美，但可以作为衡量成功的标志。你知道，每六名新员工中只有一名能成为**合伙人**。结果发现，我们的系统存在一些**偏见**。我只给你说最重要的三点，因为毕竟是**麦肯锡**，我们发现了大约**50种不同的影响因素**。

第一点是，我们过去过于关注你是否拥有**完美的成绩**，而不是你是否经历过**挫折并从中恢复**。经历过挫折并恢复的申请者更具**韧性**，更有可能在**麦肯锡**成为**合伙人**，而我们过去并没有筛选这一点。所以我们改变了流程，在申请过程中寻找**韧性**。

第二点，这听起来可能令人震惊，但我们过去没有足够重视你是否曾以重要方式与他人**实际合作**的经验。从根本上说，我们是帮助客户改变的。如果你参加过**团队运动**，或者在**零售业**工作过，或者在大学期间打工，你都必须与他人互动。这培养了一种**人际交往技能**，我们现在对此给予了更多重视。

第三点，也是最后一点，这很有趣：你是否具备**学习新事物的能力**，而不是你是否精通你选择学习的科目？我最小的儿子就曾用这一点来反驳我。当时我中间的儿子第三次换专业，我有点沮丧。他说：“但是爸爸，你发表过一篇论文说，如果你有学习新事物的能力……”我说：“是的，但是你必须在你选择的科目上表现出色，把你的简历发给我。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bob Sternfelds**: I might frame it in what are some things we're confident about now and then what are some things we're exploring. When I came into this role and it was a little over four years ago, I asked our talent attraction team, "How we doing on attracting talent?" And I got a we're doing great, Bob. We're doing great. I said, "Why?" And said, "Well, we get over a million applications a year and we hire anywhere between 8 and 10,000 people and even the million aren't a normal distribution, right? It's there's some of the brightest minds in the world that are applying. So effectively, what's the problem? Why are you asking me? Let me go back and do my job." And I kind of kept asking the question, but well, how many profiles are we are we really looking for? What what are we systematically screening out? And it turned out that really when you boil it down worldwide, there's really only 500 pathways that would lead you to McKenzie. And that wasn't tying with what our own organizational research was saying that the half-life on skills was getting shorter, that people were too focused on paper credentials, did you have the right credentials? And so we actually applied analytics on ourselves and took the last 20 years of data and said what are the skills and characteristics that are most likely to make partner in McKenzie because that's it's not perfect but it's kind of a marker of of success. You know only one in six hires make make partner. And it turned out we had some bias in our system. I'll just give you I mean it was McKenzie so we had like 50 different implications but I'll give you the biggest three. One was that we were too focused on did you have perfect marks versus did you have a setback and recover and the applicant who had a setback and recovered was more resilient and more likely to be a higher probability of making partner in McKenzie and we weren't screening for that. So we've changed the process to look for resilience in the in the application process. It may sound shocking, but we weren't indexing enough on had you had real experience in a significant way working with others. Fundamentally, we're about helping our clients change. And if you've worked if you've done a team sport or if you've worked in retail, working your way through college, you've had to engage with others. And it's built a skill, a human-to-human skill that we're now indexing a lot more on. And then the last one was interesting. Did you have the aptitude to learn new stuff versus had you mastered the subject that you chose to study? And my my youngest guy used this one against me actually when he was my middle guy was changing his major for the third time and I was a little frustrated with him and he's like but dad you published a paper that said you know if you have the aptitude to learn new stuff and I'm like yeah but you have to do well in the subject that you go to send send his resume to me.

</details>

**主持人**: 那是他唯一一次引用我的话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It's the only time

</details>

**Bob Sternfelds**: 是他唯一一次引用我的话。我当时想：“真的吗？”但这确实促使我们改变了**评估技术**，我们有意创造一个环境，在这个环境中，世界上任何人都不会有任何**模式识别**能力，然后我们评估你在一个没有**模式识别**能力的环境中表现如何。你只需要去找出问题。所以这些是我们现在知道正在转向的一些技能。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bob Sternfelds**: It's the only time he quoted me. I was like really? But it did get us to then change our assessment techniques where we purposely create an environment where you will no human in the world will have any pattern recognition in this environment and we figure out how well do you do in an environment where you have no pattern recognition. You just have to go figure things out. So those are some of the skills now we know we're moving to.

### AI时代人类领导力的核心价值

**Bob Sternfelds**: 我们现在已经启动了更具探索性的前瞻性研究，你会说：“好吧，如果每个人都通过这些**AI工具**变得**超人**了，那么除了**韧性**、**团队合作**、**学习新事物的能力**之外，你还想增加些什么？”我刚才告诉你的这部分，我感觉相当确定。我接下来要告诉你的这部分，我们更多地处于**探索模式**，我会坦诚相告。其中一点是，**模型不擅长什么**？对吧？**模型不擅长什么**？第一，它们没有**抱负**。它们不擅长设定正确的**抱负水平**。所以当你思考**伟大领导者**所做的事情时，他们会帮助组织设定正确的**抱负**：我们应该追求什么？所以我们如何开始寻找和发展**领导力技能**？在**后AI时代**，**领导力**将是持久的，因为领导者所做的伟大事情之一就是帮助设定**抱负**并激励人们去超越。所以我们正在关注这一点。第二是**判断力**。你一次又一次地看到，这些模型中没有**真相**，模型中没有**判断力**。人类需要施加这些参数。那么你如何培养**判断力**，如何建立这种能力？然后也许我们花了很多时间关注的最后一点是，这些**模型是推理模型**。它们擅长以**线性方法解决问题**，这正是我们过去一百年一直在教授的。它们不擅长的是**不连续的飞跃**，真正**新颖的思维**。所以我们开始思考，哪些背景的人会更具**创造力**，能够提出那些不关乎下一个逻辑步骤，而是关乎**不连续性**的事物。所以我们正在重新审视**文科**学位，并思考，嘿，让我们重新关注过去可能被**边缘化**的一些事物，看看我们能否获得更多**创造力**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bob Sternfelds**: We've launched more of an exploratory look now going forward where you say, "Okay, but if everyone gets super human with these AI tools, what do you want to add on top of this resilience, teamwork, ability to learn new stuff?" That part I just told you I feel pretty solid about. This part I'm going to tell you is is places we're more in exploration mode and just be be honest with you. And one of them is, well, what do the models not do well? Right? What do the models not do well? One, they don't aspire. They're not good at setting the right aspiration level. And so when you think about what great leaders do is they help an organization set the right aspiration, what should we aspire to? And so how do we start to look for and develop the skills of leadership? Leadership is going to be durable in a post-AI world because one of the great things leaders do is they help set an aspiration and get people to stretch. So we're we're kind of focusing on that. The second is judgment. And you've seen time and time again these models don't there's there's not truth in the model. There's not judgment in the model. Humans need to impose those parameters. So how do you build judgment and how do you build that capability? And then maybe the the last one we're we're we're spending a lot of time on is the models are inference models. They're great at a linear approach to problem solving, which is kind of what we've been teaching for the last hundred years. What they're not great is discontinuous leaps, truly novel thinking. And so we're starting to figure out where are backgrounds that are going to be more creative to come up with things that aren't about the next logical step, but are about a discontinuity. And so we're going back to liberal arts degrees and kind of saying, hey, let's come back to some of the things that might have been deprioritized in the past to see if we can get a little bit more creativity.

### 麦肯锡对过去争议的反思与改进

**主持人**: 我们回顾了过去，也展望了未来，你谈到了一些正在进行的值得庆祝的事情。但我需要问的是，近年来你们也经历了一些不受欢迎的**负面新闻**。我指的是**奥施康定（OxyContin）**事件、在**南非**的**贿赂指控**，以及在美国和其他地方的**利益冲突指控**。你如何解释这一切？你如何看待所发生的事情以及原因？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: We've sort of looked looked back, we've looked forward, you've talked about the some of the celebratory stuff that's going on. I need to ask though, you you've also had, you know, your share of unwelcome publicity in recent years. And I'm talking about OxyContin, bribery, bribery charges in South Africa, conflict of interest accusations in the US and elsewhere. How do you account for all of that? How do you look at what happened and and why?

**Bob Sternfelds**: 我很高兴你问了这个问题。我认为从大约四五年前开始，这对我们来说是一次真正的**灵魂拷问**，主要围绕两个问题。一方面，我们应该在哪里更加**谦逊**，从错误中学习？同时，我们又应该在哪里更加**勇敢**，直言不讳地说：“我们不同意你的看法，即使会面临批评，我们也要反击，因为这是我们所坚信的。”让我分别阐述这两点。

你看，你提到的一些事件显然属于**谦逊**的范畴。我认为我们从中获得了一些重要的教训，特别是与**阿片类药物**相关的工作以及我们在**南非**的合作。我们学到的是，我们必须对**客户选择**进行更高的**尽职调查**。我们建立了一个非常**健全的评估框架**，现在它会审视从国家、主题、机构、个人到运营环境的各个方面，以确定这是否是我们真正想引入公司的客户。因此，我与我们的**合伙人**们使用的一种说法是（你知道，在合伙企业中推动变革是很难的）：你们都从小就认为，作为**合伙人**的特权之一就是**代表公司做出承诺**。我并不是说现在情况不再如此，但你不能独自完成。你必须与**风险专业人士**一起。我们投入了大约**十亿美元**。我请来了**苹果公司**的**内部审计主管**和**沃尔玛公司**的**合规主管**，基本上是为了让我们在这些流程上实现**现代化**。这也是为什么我说，看，我们道歉。我们做错了那些事。但我们不想仅仅是为了**补救问题**。我们想努力为我们这个行业树立**专业标准**。所以我认为这是一个重要的教训：你如何从错误中学习？保持**谦逊**，但不要仅仅寻求修复它们，而是寻求真正让自己变得更好。我们在这方面学到了很多。**麦肯锡**从中吸取了大量教训，我们正在努力让自己变得更好。我一直努力向**监管机构**和客户开放自己，说：“看，这些是我们制定的新协议。你们有什么建议能让它们变得更好吗？”因为即使是我们已经制定的，我也不确定我们在这方面是否会有一个终点。所以，我只是想就此打住。我痴迷于我们必须踏上旅程，努力争取为我们这个行业树立**专业标准**。

但正如你所说，我们工作的**命脉**，以及为什么世界各地这么多优秀人才会来，是因为他们能够与客户产生**影响力**。我的意思是，从外部看，**麦肯锡**似乎致力于在全球各地市场尽可能快地增长，而且在设计上，**中央监督**相对较少。从外部看，这听起来就像是**麻烦的根源**。这是一个公平的分析吗？

**Bob Sternfelds**: Well, I'm glad you asked and this has been I think it's been a real soul-searching for us starting about four or five years ago of really two questions. On the one hand, where should we be more humble and learn from our mistakes and at the same time where should we be more courageous and just say look we disagree with you and we're even though we'll face criticism we're going to push back because that's what we believe in. And let me kind of parse each of those. Look that some of the ones that you mentioned fall clearly in the in the humble camp. And I think some of the great learnings that we had if I just take take two in particular the work with opioids and our partnerships in South Africa, what we learned is that we have to have a higher diligence around client selection and we put in place a framework that is a really robust assessment now that looks across every aspect from the country, the topic, the institution, the individuals, and the operating environment to say, is this a client that we actually want to bring in to the firm? And so one of the languages that I've used with our partners, and it's hard to drive change in a partnership is you all grew up with the idea that one of the privileges of a partner is to commit the firm. And I'm not saying that's not the case anymore, but you don't do it alone. You do it with risk professionals. And we invested about a billion dollars. I brought in the head of internal audit from Apple, the head of compliance from Walmart to basically kind of modernize us around these processes. And it's why I also said, look, we apologize. We got those wrong. And but we don't want to set out just to remediate the problem. We want to set out to try and set the standard for professionalism for our industry. And so I think that is an important lesson of how do you learn from your mistakes? Stay humble, but not seek to just repair them, but seek to actually make make yourself better. And we've had a lot of learnings around that. Mackenzie has learned a ton from this, and we're setting out to make ourselves better. And one of the things that I've tried to open myself up to both to regulators and to clients is look, these are the new protocols we put in place. Do you have any ideas on how we can make them better? Because even what we've put in place, I'm not sure we're ever going to be done on this front. So, I just wanted to close the loop on that. Like, I'm obsessed with we got to be a journey to try and aspire to set the standard for professionalism for our our our profession. But then, as you say, look, the lifeblood of what we do and it's why so many great talent from around the world come is the kind of impact that they can have with clients. I mean, from the outside, you know, it looked like McKenzie was committed to growing as quickly as possible in markets all over the world, you know, with with by design relatively little centralized oversight. And again, from the outside, that sounds like a a recipe for trouble. Is that is that a fair analysis?

</details>

**Bob Sternfelds**: 不，不完全是。从外部这样说很容易，但事实是这里有三四种力量在起作用。一方面，媒体和政府对所有机构的**审查**日益严格。因此，我们通过这个过程学到的一件事是，有些事情我们会受到批评，但我们会**反击**。我们因为在**难以减排的行业**的**转型问题**上的工作而受到严厉批评，有人说**麦肯锡**正在加速**气候退化**等等。我们反驳说，不，如果你致力于**气候转型**，你就必须与**最难减排的行业**合作。如果说没有这些行业你就能解决这个问题，那简直是天真。所以，这其中一部分是源于更多的**透明度**和更多的**批评**，我正在努力培养更强的**抗压能力**。另一部分是我们**组织模式**的演变，它表明，随着我们变得更大，随着世界变得更复杂，以及更多的要求被提出，我们确实需要更严格的**合规标准**。这就是为什么我们应该拥有与**上市公司**相同的**合规和问责标准**的理念，即使我们不是上市公司，我认为这是我们过去六年经历的最大变化之一。**增长**从来都不是我们的**目标函数**。我们是**私人公司**，没有**季度收益**。你不会看到**麦肯锡**谈论我们有多少**营收增长**，因为我们内部的**企业文化**是，我们是一个**专业机构**，而不是一个**商业公司**，这意味着我们希望将客户的利益置于我们自身利益之上，目标应该是我们是否在做**独特的工作**，而不是任何类型的工作。但如果没有正确的**控制措施**，你就无法保证这一点。所以，我认为我们学到的一件事是，即使我们有这样的**企业文化**，并且**目标函数**从来都不是不惜一切代价地增长，但如果你不建立**合规体系**，你就无法真正执行这些标准。放弃一部分**自主权**对**合伙企业**来说是痛苦的。但我认为这是我们现在已经相当迅速地达成共识的一点。在**合伙企业**中，你永远无法实现**100%的统一**。但我认为大家普遍认为，这些事情让我们变得更好，为了维护企业的**完整性**，放弃这种**自主权**是值得的。

**Bob Sternfelds**: Uh, no, not really. It's easy to kind of say that are you from the outside, but the truth of the matter is you have three or four forces that are going on here. On the one hand, there's an increasing scrutiny on the side of media, governments for for all institutions. And so one of the things that we learned through this process is there are some things that we're going to be criticized for that that we're just going to push back on. We got heavily criticized for our work in hard to abate sectors on their transition issues and it was McKenzie's accelerating climate degradation etc. And we pushed back and said no look if you're going to be committed to climate transition you have to work with the hardest to abate sectors. It's just naive to say that you're going to solve this problem without that. And so there's a portion of this that was rooted in just more transparency, more criticism. And I'm trying to build a bit of thicker skin. There's a portion which was an evolution in our organization model that said look as as we do get bigger and as the world gets more complicated and more requirements are thrown in, we do need tighter compliance standards. And this is where the idea that we should have the same compliance and accountability standards as a publicly traded company even though we're not publicly traded was I think one of the greatest changes that we've been through in the last six years. And growth has never been our objective function. We're privately traded. We don't have quarterly earnings. You don't see McKenzie talking about oh we had revenue growth of this or that because the ethos internally is that we're a profession not a business meaning that we want to put our clients interests ahead of ourselves and the objective should be are we doing distinctive work versus any kind of work but without the right controls you can't guarantee that and so one of the things I think we learned is even though we had that as our ethos and the objective function was never grow at all cost. If you don't put in place compliance, you're not going to actually be able to enforce those standards. And it's painful for a partnership to give up some of that autonomy. But I think it's one that we now have pretty immediate. You you never get 100% uniformity in a in a partnership. But I think there's pretty good agreement that these things have made us better and it's worth giving up that autonomy to actually preserve the integrity of the enterprise.

### 从“咨询顾问”到“影响力伙伴”

**主持人**: 我再给你抛出一个常见的批评论调，那就是人们会说**咨询顾问**开出**框架**，但不必承担后果。你如何确保**麦肯锡**的建议不仅仅是**PowerPoint战略**，而是能产生真正持久的**长期影响**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I'll throw one more, you know, sort of critical trope your way, which is, you know, that people would say consultants prescribe frameworks but don't have to live with the consequences. How do you ensure that McKenzie's advice is more than a PowerPoint strategy? You know, that it creates real lasting long-term impact.

</details>

**Bob Sternfelds**: 我希望有一天我们能完全摆脱**PowerPoint**，我带着对**微软**的爱说这句话。但这不仅仅是提供独特的洞察。它回到了我们真正渴望成为的理念，那就是成为客户的**影响力伙伴**。我们正在经历一场变革之旅，坦率地说，我们正从一种**咨询模式**转向一种**担保成果**的模式。今天，**Audi**，我们总收入的大约**三分之一**是**担保成果**。所以，这不再是“嘿，你给了我一个**PowerPoint**，太棒了。”而是我们共同承诺实现这个成果，并且我们在这段旅程中紧密相连，直到这个**影响力**得以实现。我希望在我担任全球管理合伙人期间，这能覆盖我们大部分的收入。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bob Sternfelds**: I hope we get out of PowerPoint entirely at someday, and I say that with love to Microsoft, but it's it isn't about providing a unique insight. It goes back to this notion of what we really aspire to be is to be impact partners with our clients and we're on a change journey of moving quite frankly from a model that was advisory to one that underwrites outcomes and and today Audi about a third of our revenues total are underwriting outcomes. So, it's not, hey, you handed me a PowerPoint, great. It's we collectively signed up for this outcome together, and we're tied on this journey all the way through until that impact is delivered. My hope is that that crosses a majority of the revenues by the time I'm done being the global managing partner.

### 领导者常犯的错误与新管理范式

**主持人**: 我们都存在了**一百年**，都在提出重要的想法。还有其他人也是如此。然而，这很难，对吧？经营企业很难。没有人真正永远破解了密码。你认为领导者最常犯的错误是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: We've been around 100 years, you've been around 100 years, we're all presenting important ideas. There are others as well. And yet, this is hard, right? Running a business is hard. Nobody really has has cracked the code forever. Where do you think leaders most consistently, you know, get things wrong?

</details>

**Bob Sternfelds**: 我认为有几件事，至少在我看来，正变得越来越重要。第一是这种对获取新信息的**渴望**和**求知欲**。当你变得过于自信，过于自负时，我认为负面的变化就会随之而来。所以，你如何拥有这种近乎**无情的探索精神**，不断质疑新事物，也许也包括组织中的所有层面。最好的想法往往隐藏在某个较低的层面。第二点，**Audi**，当你谈到我们两个组织时，你把它联系起来了，那就是你自己在多大程度上做这些事情，而不是考虑**合作关系**。我认为我们越来越多地看到，当人们在**价值链**中进行**协作**时，你会发现**不成比例的收益**。然而，我们的组织并没有很好地适应协作，我们就是没有。所以，对新事物的渴望，以及对**协作**的关注。最后，我想说，这可能是一种**时代标志**，也可能不是，但**速度**很重要。我们已经深入研究过的一件事是，**更快的组织**会超越**更慢的组织**，即使它们犯了更多的错误。然而，我们并没有被设计成这样做。大型企业中存在着如此大的**风险规避**。如果我们能在这方面多投入一点，我认为会发生伟大的事情。那么，在**管理问题**上，今天与公司如何适应**地缘政治**或**技术冲击**相比，根本性的不同是什么？你看到了哪些正在形成的新**管理范式**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bob Sternfelds**: I think there is some mix of a couple things that are, at least in my mind, increasingly important. One is this hunger and thirst to acquire new information. And whenever you get too confident, too overconfident, I think change for the negative is going to come. And so how do you have this almost ruthless quest for let me continue to question new things and maybe also from all levels in the organization. Often the best ideas are embedded somewhere lower down. The second and Audi you kind of linked it when you talked about both of our organizations is how much do you do this yourself versus do you think about partnerships and I think increasingly we're seeing when people collaborate across the value chain etc you you find disproportionate gain and yet our organizations aren't geared to collaborate well right we're just not and so thirst for new a focus on on collaboration. And then finally, I would say, and maybe this is kind of a sign of the times, maybe not, but speed matters. You know, one of the things that we've we've studied to death is faster organizations outperform slower organizations even if they make more mistakes. And yet, we're not wired to do that. There's such risk aversion in large enterprise. If we could lean in a bit more to that, I think great things happen. So on the issue of management, what what seems to be fundamentally different today, you know, versus how companies have to adapt to, you know, jolts in geopolitics or or with technology, you know, what are you seeing in terms of kind of new management paradigms that are taking shape today?

</details>

**Bob Sternfelds**: 我是从我所进行的讨论的角度来看待这个问题的，那就是CEO们关注什么？现在有哪些重要话题占据着**高级管理团队**的头脑，以及他们之间和与董事会的讨论？你可以想象，这会根据你在世界上的位置而有所不同。但**Audi**，你提出的问题中有一些似乎是**普遍存在的主题**。如果其中一个主题不是我们谈论过的“我如何从这项技术中获取价值，以及其他人都在做什么，因为这很难”，那我就是在撒谎。所以我会把这作为主题之一：我如何通过我们眼前正在发生的技术革命来**改造我的企业**。第二个大主题是，我如何建立更强的**机构韧性**？因为我越来越多地以CEO的身份思考，不幸的是，事情永远不会回到过去的样子，世界将充满**持续的冲击**。所以在这样一个充满持续冲击的世界里，我的组织是否拥有足够的**机构韧性**？当你深入探究这一点时，人们常说的是：我喜欢运动，我给你一个**运动类比**。我需要同时**进攻和防守**。所以，我需要防守，我需要足够的**缓冲**，足够的**余地**来抵御我意想不到的冲击。但我也不能只防守。我需要一些能力来**大胆下注**，即使我可能受到**外部冲击**。我能同时进攻和防守吗？这是我关于如何建立**机构韧性**的简单版本。

然后也许是最后一个，如果我只给你三个的话，那就是我还没有遇到一个认为自己的**组织模式**是完美的CEO。一个都没有。你知道，很多**开创性思维**实际上来自一些东西。我在这里要暴露我的年龄了，但我告诉过你我在研究历史。**Gil Cle**在1959年**HBR**上发表的一篇论文，这是在他成为全球管理合伙人之前。他是我的前任之一，但这篇论文是关于创建**全球组织**的，它是**矩阵式组织**的**前身思想**。如果你看看今天几乎所有的大型企业，都有某种版本的**矩阵式组织**。我从CEO们那里听到了不同的**紧张点**，关于为什么他们的组织是完成他们需要完成的工作的**瓶颈**之一。它太慢了，太笨重了，我无法**重新分配资源**，它无法帮助我做出复杂的**地理决策**。**Audi**，无论是什么，我听到了很多关于我的未来**组织模式**应该是什么样的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bob Sternfelds**: I kind of look at it from the lens of the discussions that I have, which is what are CEOs focused on, right? What are what are some big topics right now that that are occupying the minds of senior management teams and their discussions both amongst themselves and and with boards and and as you can imagine that that varies based on where you sit in the world. But there are some themes to your question Audi that seem to be transversal. I'd be lying if one of the themes wasn't one of the ones that we talked about, which is how do I get value from this technology, you know, and and what is everyone else doing because this is hard. And so I would put that as one of the the themes of how do I transform my enterprise through this this revolution in technology that we're seeing right before our eyes. The second big theme is how do I build more institutional resilience? Because I'm increasingly I'm talking now in the in the guise of a CEO of the mind that unfortunately things will never go back to how they were there's going to be a world of continuous shocks and so in a world of continuous shocks do I have enough institutional resilience in my organization. And when you burrow under that, what folks often say is I need I like sports I'll give you a sports analogy I I need to play offense and defense at the same time. So, I need defense that I need enough buffer, enough cushion to be able to withstand something that I don't see coming. But I also can't just play defense. I need some capacity to take some bold bets even when I may be getting hit with exogenous shocks. Can I play offense and defense at the same time? is my simple version of how do you build institutional resilience? And then maybe the last one, if I were to just give you three, is I haven't met a CEO yet that thinks that their organization model is perfect. Haven't met one. And a lot of the seminal thinking actually comes from some stuff. I'm going to date myself here, but I told you I was doing history. A 1959 paper in HBR by Gil Cle was a this was before he became a GMP. He was one of my predecessors, but it was about creating a global organization and it was the precursor thinking to the matrixed organization. And if you kind of look at almost every large enterprise today, there is some version of a matrixed organization. And I hear different tension points from CEOs about why their org is one of the bottlenecks in getting done what they need to get done. It's too slow. It's too cumbersome. I can't resource reallocate. It doesn't help me with complicated geography decisions. Whatever it may be, Audi, I hear a lot of questions about what should my future organization model be?

### 麦肯锡未来十年的愿景

**主持人**: 那么，十年后，你希望**麦肯锡**以哪些今天不为人知的事物而闻名？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So, in 10 years time, what would you like McKenzie to be known for that it is not known for today?

</details>

**Bob Sternfelds**: 我认为这必须是我们希望仍然为人所知的事物和一些新事物的结合，对吧？因为这不会仅仅是**麦肯锡**今天不为人知的事物。我希望它继续为人所知的部分是作为世界的**领导力工厂**，对吧？令人非常兴奋的一件事是，无论人们在我们这里待多久，他们去到哪里都表现得相当出色。我们培养的CEO比世界上任何其他机构都多，我希望十年后仍然如此。人们来到我们这里，抱歉，这是我的直白表达，也许这里的经历并不轻松，也许相当艰难，他们会得到很多严厉的反馈，但无论你在**麦肯锡**工作两年还是三十年，我们是否让你成为一个更好的领导者？我希望这一点能保持下去。我希望你所说的新部分是今天正在进行但尚未广为人知的事情，那就是我们完成了从**顾问**到**影响力伙伴**的转变。**麦肯锡**不再以“嘿，他们给了我很好的建议，如果成功了那是因为他们很聪明，如果失败了那是因为我没有执行”这种玩笑而闻名。而是转变为“我们共同设计了一个**商业案例**，这些人**担保**了我和董事会共同设定的成果，我们踏上了这段旅程，并且我们坚持不懈，直到我们达到了我原以为无法达到的地方。”我认为这是我希望在未来十年完全实现的部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Bob Sternfelds**: I think it's got to be a mix of what do I hope we're still known for and then what might be some new things, right? I because it's not going to be just stuff that McKenzie isn't known for today. I I hope the part that it's continued to be known for is leadership factory of the world, right? And and one of the things that's been very exciting is no matter how long folks stay with us, they tend to do pretty well wherever they go. And you know we produce more CEOs than any other institution in the world and I hope that's still the case in 10 years. Our are folks coming to us and sorry this is just my direct language, maybe the experience isn't easy and and maybe it's pretty hard and they got a lot of tough feedback but do we make you a better leader no matter how long you're in Mckenzie 2 years 30 years but do you leave Mackenzie a better I hope that remains. I hope the part that is new to your point is something that's inflight today but I think not really well known which is we complete this journey from being an adviser to an impact partner and that McKenzie is not known for hey they gave me great advice but you know if it worked that was because they were smart and if it didn't work it's because I didn't implement which is the you know the joke right but as it moved to you know what we designed a business case together and these guys underwrote the same outcomes that I took to the board and we went on this journey and we kept at it until we got to someplace I didn't think I could get to. I think that's the the part that I'd love to land fully in this next decade.
