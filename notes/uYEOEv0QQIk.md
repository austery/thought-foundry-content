title: 中美关系缓和推动市场走高，AWS大范围宕机引发开盘混乱
---
### 开盘前瞻：中美关系缓和带来看涨信号

大家早上好，欢迎回到新一期的市场开盘直播。感谢各位的到来。今天有很多话题要谈，我们看到**盘前交易**（premarket: 指在常规股市交易时段之前进行的股票交易）呈现绿色，这是一个非常好的迹象。希望从昨天夜间市场延续至今的这股涨势，能够持续到正式开盘。大约45分钟后我们就能见分晓。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. We are live. Thank you everybody for being here. Good morning. We had a lot to talk about. We got a green premarket which is very nice to see. Hopefully that green which is continuing from the overnight markets yesterday can continue into the actual market open and we're going to find out in about 45 minutes.</p>
</details>

我们收到一些关于中国的头条新闻，这些消息相对利好，我认为这也是盘前市场上涨的原因。预计今天全天我们还会获得更多关于中国方面的更新。希望在特朗普总统前往首尔与中国国家主席习近平于11月1日会晤之前，情况不会变得太糟。顺便一提，特朗普也可能在11月1日与金正恩会面。这是我们今天得知的一个新动态，所以我们将关注其是否会发生。特朗普总统是美国历史上唯一一位与朝鲜领导人会晤的总统，那是在2018年。所以，这可能会在10月底、11月初再次发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh we got some China headlines that are relatively bullish which is why I think the markets are actually green in the pre and we're going to get some more updates on that China stuff throughout the entire day. So hopefully that stuff is not as bad going into Seoul where President Trump will be meeting with Xi Jinping, the Chinese president on November 1st. By the way, uh Trump might be meeting with Kim Jong-un on November 1st as well. So that was a new update we found out about today. So we're going to see if that happens. President Trump was the only president in American history that actually met with the uh dictator in North Korea uh back in 2018. So, that might happen again going into the end of October, early November.</p>
</details>

本周将有特斯拉和Netflix的财报，这将是重要的一周。我们将看看这两家公司会发生什么。我们会做一个简短的财报预览，看看情况如何。盘前交易中，一些科技股有很多不同的更新，包括对苹果的一些评级上调。iPhone 17的预购数据以及实际订单数据开始出炉，而且相当可观。有一家公司甚至将苹果的目标价上调至275美元，另一家则上调至310美元，这是我们很长一段时间以来首次看到苹果的目标价达到300美元。所以我们会讨论这个，并深入一些细节。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We got Tesla and Netflix this week. It's going to be a big one, and we're going to see what happens with Tesla and Netflix. We'll do a little bit of an earnings preview and see what we've got going on there. We had a bunch of different updates for some of these tech stocks in the pre-marketing, including some uh upgrades on Apple, these iPhone 17 pre-order numbers, and then actual order numbers are starting to come in, and it's pretty damn juicy. You got one firm even raising Apple to 275 and another firm raising them to 310. first $300 up here on Apple that we've seen in a long time. So, we'll talk about that. We'll go through some of those details.</p>
</details>

接着我们会谈谈亚马逊，因为亚马逊在盘前交易中遇到了一些问题，不仅是股票，公司本身也出了状况，这影响到了Robinhood、Coinbase、Snapchat以及所有依赖**AWS**（Amazon Web Services: 亚马逊云服务，全球最大的云计算平台）的公司。所以我们会讨论这个问题，然后继续。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then we'll talk about Amazon because Amazon had some issues in the uh in the pre-market, not just the stock, but the actual company itself and that affected Robin Hood, Coinbase, Snapchat, all the companies that rely on AWS. So, we'll talk about that and keep going from there.</p>
</details>

### 美国内政与市场情绪

好的，感谢大家来到这里。我们开始吧，有很多内容要讲。Hassett现在正在CNBC上，我们稍后会提到他。他正在谈论政府停摆的问题。希望他能对停摆发表一些积极的看法。我这里有他的引述，他认为停摆很可能在本周某个时候结束，这大概也是很多人所期望的。如果停摆不结束，白宫将会考虑采取更强硬的措施。希望在未来几天内问题能得到解决。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, thank you everybody for being here. Let's get started. We got a lot to get into. Hassets on CNBC right now. We'll get to him in a second. He's talking about this government shutdown. Hopefully he's saying something positive about the shutdown. He does have the quote right here that I I think the shutdown is likely to end sometime this week, which is kind of what I think a lot of people were expecting. Uh and if the shutdown doesn't end, the White House will look at stronger measures. Hopefully, it ends up uh getting fixed in the next coming days.</p>
</details>

是的，也祝大家排灯节快乐。对于那些庆祝这个印度节日的人，我今晚要回家和家人一起过节。所以，如果你是印度人并且庆祝这个节日，也祝大家排灯节快乐。这个节日基本上是庆祝正义战胜邪恶。当然，正义战胜邪恶背后有很多故事，但其核心就是庆祝这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, happy Diwali to everybody as well. For those that do celebrate it, Indian holiday, I am going to be going back home tonight to uh see some family for Dvali. So, if you are Indian and you do celebrate it, happy Dvali to everybody as well. It's kind of a what is it? It's it's it's I mean it's basically a holiday that se uh that that celebrates good over evil if I had to sum it up. I mean there's a lot of backstory to what good over evil means but at its core it's a celebration of good over evil. So that's what we got on the Bali.</p>
</details>

### 中美关系缓和推动市场走高

好了，我们开始吧。我认为我们得从中国的消息开始，因为这是过去几天里最利好的消息，也是盘前市场上涨的原因。昨晚，特朗普基本上平息了许多关于中美关系降级的担忧，这是市场真正期待的。由于得到了这个消息，我认为这就是我们看到绿色势头的原因。标普500指数达到667点，如果我们能达到670点，甚至673点的历史高点，也并非遥不可及。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so let's get started. I think we got to start with this China news because this is the most bullish stuff we've had over the past couple of days and that is why the markets are green in the pre. Uh Trump last night basically calmed down a lot of concerns when it came to deescalation around um China and this was stuff that you know the market really was looking for and as a result of getting it I think that's why we are seeing this green momentum. S&P 500 667 if we can get 670 maybe 673 which is alltime highs is not that crazy to achieve.</p>
</details>

特斯拉上涨1%，Palantir上涨1%，Hoodie上涨3%。谷歌、Grab、Reddit、亚马逊都上涨了，即使亚马逊在盘前遇到了问题。Meta、Salesforce、AMD、SoFi也都在上涨。很多涨势都是基于特朗普昨晚关于中国的言论。他说了什么呢？基本上，他说他希望解决问题，不想与中国陷入大规模的贸易战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tesla's up 1%. Palanteer's up 1%. Hoodie up 3%. Google's up. Grab's up. Reddit's up. Amazon's up even with Amazon's issues in the pre-market. Meta's up. Salesforce, AMD, SoFi, a lot of this based on what Trump said last night uh around China. And what did he say? Well, basically he said that he wants to resolve things and he doesn't want to get into this massive trade war with China.</p>
</details>

特朗普表示：“现在他们向美国支付了难以置信的金额。他们可能付不了那么多。我对此没意见。我们可以降低一些，但他们也必须为我们做些事。这不再是单行道了。” 当被问及会降到多少时，他回答说：“这要看情况。我们得看他们想要什么。我们施加的其中一项惩罚是因为他们运送芬太尼，我们对此征收了20%的关税。但他们将要支付大约157%的关税，这是创纪录的。我不想让他们那样做。我想帮助中国，我不是想伤害中国，但他们也必须给我们一些东西。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Uh now they're paying an unbelievable amount of money to the United States. They probably can't pay that much. And I'm okay with that. We can lower that, but they have to do things for us, too. It's no longer a one-way street. Yeah. >> What would you lower it to, do you think? >> Depends. I mean, we'll have to see what they want. One of the penalties we have in because they're sending in fentinol, we have a 20%, as you know, a 20% tariff on that, but they'd be paying about 157% tariff, which is, you know, record setting type tariff. Uh, I don't want them to do that. I want to help China. I want to not looking to hurt China, but they have to give us things, too.</p>
</details>

正如你所看到的，这非常利好，对吧？“我想帮助中国，我不想伤害中国，但他们也必须给我们一些东西。” 他接着还谈到，他不想和中国玩稀土矿产的游戏，希望中国能真正合作。中国在过去几天也表示，他们准备好与美国合作，与美国脱钩是不理性的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Mr. President, >> as you can see right there, pretty bullish, right? I want to help China. I don't want to hurt China, but they have to give us some stuff, too. He also goes on to then talk about how he doesn't want to play the rare earth mineral game with China and he wants China to actually cooperate. China's also, you know, said over the past couple days that they are ready to work with the US and decoupling from them would be irrational.</p>
</details>

然后，周末发生了一件大事，但似乎没有引起太多注意。上周，Scott Bent对一位中国官员出言不逊。现在我们有了关于这位中国官员后续的更新。当时他提到一位“有点失常”的低级别贸易官员，名叫李康宫（音译），此人威胁说如果美国继续对中国船只征收停泊费，中国将给全球体系带来混乱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then here's the biggest thing that happened that kind of went under notice over the weekend. This was Scott Bent talking, for lack of a better word, talking smack about one of the Chinese officials uh last week and then we have an update on what happened to one of those Chinese officials. B and C. Therefore, we had to do D. And that that's not true. Is there there was a low lower level trade person who was slightly unhinged here in August. Uh I think his name is Lee Lee Kangong. and uh you know threatening saying that the chi China would unleash chaos on the global system if the US went ahead with uh our docking fees for Chinese ships and uh this is clearly something that they were planning all along. I I think that things can deescalate that we we don't want to have to escalate. Uh we have things that are</p>
</details>

昨晚，中国最高贸易谈判代表，也就是Scott Bent提到的那位李先生，被免去了世界贸易组织常驻代表的职务。这可以说是重大进展。不仅特朗普说我们希望与中国缓和关系，然后Bent点名批评的那位所谓“失常”的中国代表，作为他们的高级贸易谈判代表之一，也被免去了世贸组织的常驻代表职务。这意味着Bent将不再需要和这个人打交道，他将面对一个可能更理性的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think things can deescalate. we don't want to escalate. And then last night, China's top trade negotiator, Lee, the guy that descent just mentioned, was removed as a permanent World Trade Organization representative. So, I mean, you're talking about some major progress. Not only is Trump saying we want to deescalate with China, then Bent who's calling out the quote unquote unhinged representative from China as one of their top rep one of their top trade negotiators. He gets removed as a permanent representative with the World Trade Organization. Meaning Bent just is not going to have to deal with this guy anymore. He's going to have to deal with someone who's probably uh a bit more reasonable.</p>
</details>

是的，他被拉黑了。没错。也许Bent在这位官员被免职中也起到了一定作用。但重点是，局势正在降温，这是非常好的现象。只要这种情况持续下去，过去几周的中美争端可能就不是什么大问题了。因此，这对市场来说将是非常有利的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, he got a black guy. Exactly. Maybe Bent had a had a role in getting this guy removed. But the point is it's deescalating and this is very very nice to see and as long as that continues to happen maybe this China scuffle that has been taking place over the past couple of weeks is not that big of a deal and as a result that would be very good for markets.</p>

### 焦点个股：科技与加密货币动态

CleanSpark刚刚获得评级上调，股价上涨11%至21.83美元。消息称，CleanSpark聘请了AI计算领域的行业资深人士Jeffrey Thomas担任AI数据中心高级副总裁。这表明CleanSpark正在全面转型，从比特币矿商转向数据中心业务。我相信他们仍会从事比特币挖矿，但聘请行业人士来领导他们的AI计算数据中心业务，很可能意味着公司正在进行战略转型。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh CleanSpark getting an upgrade right here look at that 2183 up 11%. The headline right here is CleanSpark has hired a industry veteran in the AI compute space Jeffrey Thomas as the senior vice president of AI data centers. All right. So, Clean Sparks making the full-on pivot right here to a data center play outside of a Bitcoin miner. And I'm sure you know they will still engage in Bitcoin mining, but hiring someone from the industry to lead their AI compute data center businesses, that likely means you're getting a bit of a pivot.</p>
</details>

上周，许多比特币矿商表现不佳。今天，Cipher上涨6%，Terawulf、Bitfarms、Hive、Marathon、Riot和Galaxy也都在上涨，IREN在盘前交易中同样上涨。随着大盘转绿，这些股票都受到追捧，标普500指数上涨约0.41%。顺便说一句，美光（Micron）今天表现疯狂，早上获得了245美元的目标价上调。我知道并非所有投资半导体的人都持有美光，但还是有相当一部分人投资。美光股价上涨4%。它不是最热门的半导体股票，但也是一个拥有自己受众的股票。八个月前，这只股票还在105美元，现在已经到了210美元。所以表现还不错，我们看到了一些新的增长势头，而且这势头很可能不会减弱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, CleanSpark right there, that is up 11%. Again, a lot of the Bitcoin miners had a crappy week last week. Cipher is up 6%, Terolf is up, Bit Farm's up, Hive is up, Marathon's up, Riot's up, Galaxy up, and then IN is also up in the premarket. All of them getting some love as the broader market goes green and the S&P 500 up about 041%. Micron by the way going crazy. They got an upgrade to 245 this morning. I know not everyone there's not a majority of people that invest in semiconductors that are in Micron but there's a decent chunk. Micron right they're up 4%. I mean it's not the hottest semiconductor name but it is one of those names that has developed an audience and you know this thing was at 105 eight months ago. Now it's at 210. So not too bad. We are seeing some more momentum there. and that is likely not slowing down.</p>
</details>

现在让我们转向Hassett，看看他对政府停摆有什么看法，获取一些最新消息，然后我们会讨论一些关于英伟达的头条新闻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's transition over to Hasset, see what he's saying about the shutdown, see if we can get some updates on that and then we'll get into uh some headlines around Nvidia</p>
</details>

Hassett表示，参议院的许多朋友都说，在“无王集会”（no kings rally）之前让政府重新开门对民主党来说观感不佳。现在有机会在本周让事情回到正轨，温和派民主党人会迅速行动，让政府重新运作。届时，我们可以通过正常程序谈判任何他们想谈的政策。他提到，新罕布什尔州的参议员Shaheen，一位头脑清醒的民主党人，周五站出来支持政府开门，这表明舒默的阵营出现了裂痕。他认为“舒默停摆”很可能在本周结束。但如果情况并非如此，白宫将不得不与Russ Vought一起考虑采取更强硬的措施来促使他们回到谈判桌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">has been very active throughout this process. But it's also his position that this is a thing that the Senate needs to work out. Uh a lot of our friends in the Senate have said that it was just bad optics for Democrats to open the government before the no kings rally and that now there's a shot that this week things will come together and very quickly the moderate Democrats will move forward and get us an open government at which point we could negotiate whatever policies they want to negotiate with regular order. Now, I was very pleased to see that my friend Senator Shaheen from New Hampshire, a a very, you know, soundminded Democrat, came out and supported opening the government on Friday. So, it means that there sort of cracks in the Schumer armor. I think the Schumer shutdown is likely to end sometime this week. But, I can tell you that if it doesn't, if it doesn't, if the story that we've been basically hearing from moderates that look, we just can't do it in front of the no Kings rally. If that ends up not being true, then I think that the White House is going to have to look very closely along with Russ vote at, you know, stronger measures that we could take to bring him to the table.</p>
</details>

关于奥巴马医改的疫情超级补贴问题，Hassett认为这是参议院需要解决的问题。民主党通过了这项法律，作为应对新冠疫情的紧急措施，但现在因为成本太高而终止了。所以这是民主党的政策，是民主党的停摆，也是舒默的停摆，参议院需要自己解决。他指出，即将到期的补贴绝大多数不会影响到低收入人群，政策只是扩大到了贫困线四倍的人群。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, there would be negotiations about what to do. We're we're running out of time before November 1st. There would be negotiations about what to do with with the uh the pandemic u super subsidies for Obamacare. Well, well, that again is an issue for the Senate that you know we the Democrats passed that law. They uh it was in an emergency for COVID and they ended it now because it was such an expensive law and so it's the Democrats policy. It's the Democrats shut down and it's the Schuber shutdown and really the Senate needs to figure it out. >> But it it affects you know real people and people in red states and I mean we're we're subsidizing healthcare for a lot of but like it or not that's just the position we're in. So there are certain people that either wouldn't have health care or where the the premiums would go up so much. And not not to say that it's uh you know not Obamacare's fault because there's a lot of flaws, but do you see something where there would be some fixes put in to get Republicans to agree to do that? >> Again, that's up to the Senate to negotiate. But if you look at the expiring subsidies, you know, the vast majority of people, certainly lowincome people, aren't affected at all. It's just that uh the the policy was expanded to people up to four times the poverty level and so you get people who have you know much much higher incomes than were intended to be predicted by</p>
</details>

Hassett对政府停摆结束的看法提供了一些更新。到目前为止，市场似乎并不太在意这件事。如果停摆持续到Kalshi预测的11月16日（他们给出的概率是30%），那将是相当激进的。但如果本周能解决，我认为这将是利好消息。问题是，这会发生吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> All right. So Hassid giving us a little bit of an update right there on the idea of this government shutdown ending. I mean so far the market hasn't really cared that much about it. So, if it ends up lasting as long as Kalshi thinks it can last, which is, you know, up until November 16th, they're giving it a uh a 30% chance right there, then, you know, that would be pretty aggressive. But if it is resolved this week, then I do think that would be more bullish than not. The question is, will we end up seeing that happen?</p>
</details>

另一件非常重要的事情是，我们仍然缺少很多政府数据。不过，我们周五将得到**CPI**（Consumer Price Index: 消费者价格指数，衡量通货膨胀的关键指标）数据，所以至少能对通胀有所了解。这将在10月29日的**FOMC**（Federal Open Market Committee: 联邦公开市场委员会，负责制定美国货币政策）会议前几天公布，届时我们很可能会再次降息25个基点。获得CPI数据无疑是重要的，获得一些就业数据也同样重要。希望如果能避免或至少解决停摆问题，我们将开始获得更多数据。但本周我们将拭目以待。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and the other thing that's really important about this, Khi now has 40 days on the forecast. The other thing that's interesting about this is, you know, we still don't have a lot of government data. Now, we will be getting CPI. That's going to be happening on Friday. So, we'll at least be getting some gauge of inflation. And that's going to be happening a couple of days before the FOMC meeting on October 29th where more likely than not, we're getting another 25 basis point cut. But having that CPI definitely would be important. Having some job data would really be important. And, you know, hopefully if we can get the shutdown avoided or at least resolved, we're going to start to get a lot more of that data. But, we're going to see throughout the week if that ends up happening as well.</p>
</details>

另外，我昨晚在《Market Future》节目中也提到了，想在这里宣布一下：Cactus Jack已正式全职加入AK Media。你们很多人可能已经认识他了，他每天都在聊天室里，基本上就像我们的个人彭博终端。他现在全职加入了，这是AK Media的首次扩张。他会帮助我获取每天所需的所有新闻，包括节目前、节目后和节目期间。他已经做这件事大概一年了，所以我只是问他，既然你每天都在，愿不愿意全职做，他同意了。所以，以后你们看到Cactus Jack发布的消息，可以认为它很可能是真实的。当然，他可能会因为信源错误而偶尔出错，但绝大多数情况下，他发布的突发新闻都是最新且准确的。所以，如果你看到财报更新或目标价上调，可以相信你得到的是可靠来源的信息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">real quick as well. I said this on the uh Market Future show last night, but just want to announce it here. Uh Cactus Jack has officially joined AK Media Fulltime. So uh a lot of you guys probably already know him every day in the chat. He's he's basically like our personal Bloomberg terminal. And um yeah, he's joining full-time. So this is our first extension of AK Media. Going to have someone who helps me basically get all the news that I need every single day, pre-show, post show, during the show. and uh you know he's already been doing it for like a year so I just asked do you do you want to do it full-time if you're already gonna be here and he said yeah let's do it. So there he is. Whenever you see a post from Cactus Jack you can assume it's more likely true than not. I mean I'm sure there's some things he'll possibly get wrong maybe because the source is wrong. Uh but more likely than not he will be up to date and accurate on pretty much every piece of breaking news. So if you see an earnings update or a price target upgrade you can trust that you're getting it from a reliable source. All right, cool. So, that's what we got from Mr. Cactus.</p>

### 加密货币市场动态

让我们来看看BMR（Bitmine）。Tom Lee这家伙真是逢低就买。周末他买了20.3万个以太坊。Tom Lee表示，加密市场在上周经历了最大规模的去杠杆事件之一，这给ETH价格带来了下行压力。ETH的未平仓合约量与今年6月30日的水平相当。考虑到以太坊预期的超级周期，这次价格错位代表了极具吸引力的风险回报。过去一周，我们购入了20万个以太坊代币，使我们的ETH持有量达到324万，占总供应量的2.7%。我们现在已经朝着最初追求的5%“炼金术”目标走过了一半多的路程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's go to BMR. I mean, Tom Lee, this guy continues to buy the damn dip. He bought 203,000 Ethereum over the weekend. Tom Lee, the crypto market saw one of its largest deleveraging events last week, and this put downward pressure on ETH prices. Open interest for ETH sits at the same level as seen on June 30th of this year. Given the expected super cycle for Ethereum, this price dislocation represents an attractive riskreward. We acquired 200,000 Ethereum tokens over the past week, pushing our ETH holdings to 3.24 million, 2.7% of the total supply. We are now more than halfway towards our initial pursuit of the alchemy of 5%.</p>
</details>

大多数人甚至认为他不会止步于5%。B. Riley给BMR的目标价上调至90美元，并认为到2026年底，他们的持仓将达到7.2%。这很合理，因为他们为什么要停下来呢？只要他们能继续以高于其**资产净值**（net asset value (NAV): 指基金或公司总资产减去总负债后的价值）的溢价进行稀释，他们可能就不会因为以太坊价格上涨而停止购买。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Most people don't even think he's going to stop at 5%. B Riley with a $90 upgrade on BMR thinks they're going to get to 7.2% by the end of 2026. And it makes sense because why would they stop, right? like they're probably not going to stop just because the price of Ethereum goes up, especially if they're able to continue diluting at a premium to their net asset value.</p>
</details>

所以，如果你是以太坊的支持者，如果你相信它，我就BMR做过一次深度分析。这是我在Substack上分析的股票之一，另外一个是Duolingo。如果你读了那篇深度分析，你会更好地理解数字资产金库的运作机制，以及以太坊是否是一个值得投资的资产。如果你相信这两点，那么你就必须为这趟旅程的波动做好准备，但长期来看，这趟旅程可能会回报丰厚。

<p class="english-text">So, look, I mean, if you're on the Ethereum bandwagon, if you believe in it, I did do a deep dive on BMR. This was one of the stocks that was on the Substack. BMR and Duolingo were the two stocks that we uh that we did a deep dive on. And you know, if you read through the deep dive, it's it's it's trying to get to a better understanding of the mechanisms and mechanics of how a digital asset treasury should operate, but also if Ethereum is an asset worth operating on. And if you believe in those two things, then you got to be ready for the volatility of the ride, but the ride might end up rewarding people long term.</p>

Bitmine股价上涨5.52%，上周随着以太坊下跌一度跌至47美元。所以，这在很大程度上取决于以太坊。如果以太坊能维持在目前的4000美元以上，我们应该有希望保持在50美元的区间。上周，Devon Ryan对SSB给出了50美元的目标价，SSB是Bitmine的竞争对手之一。我对SSB了解不多，但我知道如果华尔街分析师开始看好ETH金库，这是个好兆头，我们绝对不应忽视。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Bit mine right there, 5.52% got all the way to 47 last week as Ethereum took a hit. So, I mean, a lot of this really is dependent on Ethereum. And if Ethereum can stay above 4,000 where it is right now, we should hopefully be able to stay in that uh in that $50 range. So that's what you have on Bitine and that's what you have on Ethereum. Now again, last week Devon Ryan initiated a price target on $50 on SSB, which is one of the competitors for Bitine. And you know, I I don't know that much about ESB, but I do know that if Wall Street analysts are starting to get bullish on ETH treasuries, that's a good thing. And that's definitely not something that we should ignite.</p>
</details>

顺便说一下，另一个以太坊金库FG Nexus已经失去了对NAV的溢价，现在交易价格低于NAV，和SSB一样。Bitmine是除MicroStrategy之外，唯一一个以高于NAV的溢价交易的数字资产金库。他们启动了2亿美元的回购计划。Bitmine已经有一个10亿美元的回购计划，以防股价跌破NAV。重点是不要跌破NAV，但他们还是启动了回购，以备不时之需。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By the way, FG Nexus, which is another Ethereum treasury, they lost their premium to NAV. They were now trading below Nav, same as ESB. Bitmine is one of the only digital asset treasuries outside of Micro Strategy that actually trades at a premium above NAV. And um these guys initiated a $200 million buyback. So, Bitmine already has a billion dollar buyback if they trade below NAV. The whole point is to not get below NAV, but these guys initiated a buyback for if they do get below NAV, which they are below below NAV.</p>
</details>

我的看法是，不要购买这个领域里除了赢家之外的任何东西。我认为赢家是BMR，对于比特币来说可能是MicroStrategy。其他许多金库都存在各种问题，筹集资金就是其中之一。你需要能够有效地做到这一点，我认为BMR正在大规模地做到这一点。至于ETHZilla，我不知道他们发生了什么。他们本应在一周前召开一次特别会议，我甚至不知道会议结果如何，但他们进行了反向拆股。这可能就是他们必须这么做的原因。这只股票之前大概是4美元吧？你必须选择这个领域的赢家，我认为BMR，尤其是有Tom Lee掌舵，将是赢家之一。Bitmine在盘前交易中上涨至52.51美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, it's just I wouldn't buy anything outside of the winners in the space. And I think the winners are BMR and probably Micro Strategy for Bitcoin. I think a lot of the other treasuries have a lot of different issues and raising capital is one of those issues. You need to be able to effectively do it and I think BMR is doing this at scale. ETHZilla, I don't know what's going on with them. They were supposed to have some special meeting a week ago and I don't even know what the outcome of that meeting was, but oh, they did a reverse split. Oh, that's probably why they had they had to do it. 1680. This thing was like $4, right? Yeah, they probably split. Again, you got to pick the winners in the space and I think BMR, especially with Tom Lee, is going to be one of those winners. Bit mine right there, 5251 as we're green in the pre-markets.</p>

### AWS大范围宕机：互联网的“脆弱时刻”

好了，我们来谈谈英伟达。不，在谈英伟达之前，我们先谈谈亚马逊。盘前交易中亚马逊发生了什么？AWS宕机了，而且宕得很严重。美国东北部依赖AWS的区域基本上瘫痪了。我当时在睡觉，凌晨5点醒来时看到了更新，但我没有在Robin Hood上进行隔夜交易，所以没有感受到人们的沮丧。但很多人对此非常不满，他们对Coinbase和Snapchat也很不满。所以这不是这些公司特有的问题，而是AWS出现了大规模的故障。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, let's talk about Nvidia. So, Nvidia, actually, let's do Amazon before we do Nvidia. So, what happened to Amazon in the pre-markets? Well, AWS got shut down, and it got shut down bad. the northeast sector of the country that runs on AWS uh basically fell apart. And I was sleeping when this happened. So, I woke up at like 5 a.m. and I saw the updates, but I wasn't like trading on the overnight markets on Robin Hood, so I didn't see like that much of the uh dismay that people had, but a lot of people were upset about it. Uh and they were upset about Coinbase, they were upset about Snapchat. So, it wasn't a specific issue to any of these companies. It was just AWS had a massive uh draw down.</p>
</details>

我们不清楚它崩溃的确切原因。是漏洞吗？是像CrowdStrike那样的时刻吗？还是像某个工程师忘了推送更新之类的事情？这种事以前发生过，工程师忘了推送更新或做某些事，然后整个系统就崩溃了。所以我们不知道具体细节，只知道它宕机了，相关的表情包绝对搞笑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, we don't know exactly why it fell. Was it a bug? Was it a crowd start strike moment? Was it one of these things where it's like, you know, some engineer forgot to push an update? Like it lit literally, this has happened before where engineers, you know, forgot to push updates or do certain things and then the entire system collapses. So, we don't know the exact details of what happened other than it ended up going down and the memes are, you know, absolutely hilarious of of what ended up happening.</p>
</details>

我认为，这件事的启示很简单，虽然我不想当那个说这种话的人，但这是事实。当CrowdStrike崩溃时，我也说了同样的话，并且买了一点，当时我应该买得更多。一家实际上运营着互联网的公司出现负面新闻——当AWS宕机时，至少半个互联网关闭了几个小时——这恰恰显示了世界对亚马逊的依赖程度有多高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the takeaway from this, it's now been resolved over the past like five hours, so it's not that big of a deal anymore. I think the takeaway from this is very simple, and I hate to be the guy to say it, but it is true. And I I was the same person who said this when CrowdStrike fell, and I bought a little bit. I should have bought a lot more during that time. Bad publicity on a company that literally runs the internet. At least half the internet shut off for a couple of hours when AWS went down. It just shows you how much the world relies on Amazon. It's just that simple.</p>
</details>

股票当时有点下跌，现在又转绿了。我知道股票波动不大，但归根结底，如果地球上每一家大公司，或者说很大一部分大公司都在使用AWS，那么当它因为任何原因——漏洞、代码、维护——而宕机，导致整个世界都停摆时，这恰恰说明了世界多么需要AWS和亚马逊。如果他们能展现出任何增长加速的迹象，我认为华尔街会重新看好这个故事，股票也会获得动力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, uh, you know, the stock was red a little bit, now it's green. I know the stock has not really moved that much but at the end of the day if every major company on the planet or you know a significant portion of every major company is using AWS. I mean if the thing shuts down and the whole world shuts down because of whatever reason bug code you know what whatever maintenance it just goes to show how much the world needs AWS and needs Amazon and if they can show any acceleration in growth then I think the street will get back on board to the story and the stocking gets momentum.</p>
</details>

自2021年以来，亚马逊的营业收入翻了四倍，而股价只上涨了12%。这只股票显然存在叙事问题，但这没关系，因为这正是你想买入的时候。叙事会改变，如果叙事迅速改变，股价也会随之迅速变化。有人说这种情况每年都会发生，而且还有其他选择。是的，这很公平。看空观点是，人们可能会离开，他们可能会说：“我们不能依赖一个会宕机的AWS，我们得转向GCP之类的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amazon has quadrupled their operating income since 2021. 4x operating income, stocks up 12%. There is obviously a narrative issue with this stock and that's okay because that's when you want to buy, but narratives change and if narratives change quickly, then the stock prices can also change very quickly as well. Eric says this happens to them like every year and there are other options. Yeah, that is fair. Look, the bare case on this, I don't want to say it's it's fully bullish just because they went down and you saw you saw how much the world relied on them. the bare cases, people might leave and they might say, you know what, we can't, you know, whatever Robin's like, dude, we cannot rely on AWS going down. We're gonna have to go to GCP or something like that.</p>
</details>

但如果这种情况每年都发生，而他们的营业收入还能翻两番，这可能意味着，归根结底，其他替代方案还不够好，无法让人们大规模转换。这就是亚马逊能保持领先地位的原因。你需要关注的是AWS的增长加速。我不想说我力挺亚马逊，因为我们可能会有一个糟糕的第三季度，AWS没有加速增长，利润率因为关税而略有下降，股价跌到195美元。这种情况完全可能发生。坦白说，如果股价跌破200美元，那将是真正买入并为2026年布局的机会。但我也认为，如果叙事朝相反方向发展，到年底股价很容易重新估值到230或240美元。我认为这是我们在考虑亚马逊时需要思考的基本情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, so that is the bare case. It's just, you know, if this has happened every year and they continue to quadruple operating income, it probably means that at the end of the day, the other alternatives just aren't good enough to get people to switch in a meaningful way. And that's what keeps Amazon at the top. 21408. Again, AWS acceleration, that's what you got to look like. I and again I don't want to say like I'm pounding the table on Amazon because we might have a crappy Q3 where AWS doesn't accelerate, margins go down a little bit because the tariffs and this stock is at 195. Like that is very possible. I would not be surprised if that happened quite frankly if we get under 200. That would be the opportunity to really buy and set up a position for 2026. Uh but I also think it could easily rerate to 230 240 by the end of the year if a narrative goes in the opposite direction. So I think that's the base case we have to be thinking about when it comes to when it comes to Amazon.</p>

### 英伟达动态：美国本土制造与AI资本支出前景

好的，英伟达有什么新动向？黄仁勋（Jensen）和台积电（TSM）在周末发布了一个相当重大的声明，他们正式揭晓了在美国制造的第一片Blackwell芯片晶圆。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, Nvidia, what do we got going on? So, uh, Jensen and TSM made a pretty big announcement over the weekend and it was that they officially unveiled the first wafer for their Blackwell chip that was created in the United States.</p>
</details>

黄仁勋说：“上周是历史性的一周。我们首次在美国，在世界上最先进的晶圆厂，制造了世界上最先进的AI芯片。这一切都始于特朗普总统希望让美国再工业化。他的关税政策是促成这一切以我们现在的速度发生的推动力。现在，在不到一年的时间里，我们正在美国制造用于AI的最先进芯片。这仅仅是个开始。通过与台湾供应链的合作，台积电是美国不可思议的战略合作伙伴，将最关键的技术领域的制造业带回美国。这只是起点，之后通过与富士康、Amkor、Spill、纬创等众多合作伙伴的合作，我们将把构建AI基础设施的整个供应链带回美国。在未来三到四年内，我们的目标是在美国制造约半万亿美元的AI超级计算技术并进行安装。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> This last week was a historic week. Uh, we manufactured the most advanced AI chips in the world in the most advanced fab in the world here in America for the first time. Uh all of this started with President Trump wanting to reindustrialize the United States. His terrorist was a pressing uh agent in making this possible at this at the at the speed that we're doing. And now at uh uh just in shortly after less than a year, we're now manufacturing the most advanced chips for AI here in the United States. This is just the beginning of it. uh with the partnership of the supply chain in Taiwan, TSMC is incredible partner in a strategic partner for the United States and in bringing manufacturing of the most in most critical sector of technology here to to United States. Uh this is just the starting point where after that with Foxcon, Amcor, Spill, uh Wistron, so many of our other partners, we're going to bring the entire supply chain of building AI infrastructure back here in the United States. By the end of uh the next uh three or four years, we'll probably manufacture, we're on on target to manufacture about half a trillion dollars of AI supercomputing technology to be installed here in the United States.</p>
</details>

这对英伟达和整个半导体生态系统都是非常利好的。黄仁勋在采访中接着说，我们并非处于泡沫之中，我们正处于**资本支出**（capex (Capital Expenditure): 指公司用于购买、维护或升级固定资产的资金）和资本支出周期的早期阶段。如果你相信黄仁勋，那么你就相信这确实只是开始。如果你不相信，那么你认为所有这些资本支出都将付诸东流。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Pretty cool stuff from Jensen. And obviously, you know, Trump loves hearing that the re-industrialization of semiconductors is beginning to happen in the United States. We did get the AMCOR mention, which is very nice. Not that many packaging companies that work as closely as AMC does with TSM and the fab that TSM have has in Arizona. 3215, right? They're up 2.75% for AMC. I mean, look, this is really bullish Nvidia and this is bullish the entire semiconductor ecosystem. Jensen goes on in that interview to basically say we are not in a bubble. We are in the beginning of the early cycles of capex and capex spend. If you believe Jensen, then you believe that this really is the beginning. If you don't believe it, then you think that all this capex spend is going to go for nothing.</p>
</details>

摩根大通今天早上发布了一份报告，称英伟达CEO黄仁勋预测AI资本支出将从6000亿美元增长到2030年的3.4万亿美元是可行的。该银行预计科技行业将通过运营现金流、私募股权和风险资本流入来资助这一增长，即使预计每年有1.6万亿美元的资金缺口。到2030年，私募市场每年可能贡献约5000亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Essentially, these companies are spending hundreds of billions of dollars for no reason. If that's not the case, then a lot of that manufacturing comes back to the United States, creates a lot of jobs, and ultimately continues the capex cycle um at the rate that it's going at right now. Now JP Morgan came out with a report this morning and they said Nvidia CEOs Jensen Huang's prediction of AI capex growing from 600 billion to 3.4 trillion by 2030 is feasible. The bank expects the tech sector to fund it through operating cash flow, private equity, venture capital inflows, even with projected 1.6 trillion annual funding gap. Private markets could contribute to about 500 billion per year by 2030.</p>
</details>

看起来私募市场已经准备好投资于此。有一家AI领域的公司在种子轮就筹集了1.33亿美元，他们正在构建另一个围绕空间推理的基础模型。许多这类公司都在追逐特定领域的**大语言模型**（LLM (Large Language Model): 一种人工智能模型，如ChatGPT），而更难的领域，比如Vlad正在做的数学超级智能，确实需要更多资本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it looks like the private markets are ready to invest in this. I mean there was a company that raised a 133 million seed round in the AI space. They're building another foundation model particularly around spatial uh reasoning is kind of how they call it. So there's essentially an LLM for a specific sector of the market which a lot of these companies are going after and the harder ones kind of Vlad is doing this with mathematical super intelligence do require more capital.</p>
</details>

显然，私募市场正在资助OpenAI和Anthropic。Anthropic将其收入目标提高到260亿美元，他们明年的目标是50亿美元。我的意思是，到2026年达到260亿美元是相当惊人的。但私募市场准备好以这种方式提供资金，这让摩根大通相信这是可能的。他们估计，新增债务中约40%（4300亿美元）将来自银行贷款，60%来自债券发行。这有点像甲骨文几周前发行的公司债券。即使债务增加，科技行业的净债务与现金流比率也只会从0.7上升到1.2，仍然低于全球平均水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh so you're going to have that going on. You've obviously got the private markets funding OpenAI and Anthropic. Anthropic raising their revenue targets to 26 billion. They're doing five billion right now for next year. I mean like 26 billion in 2026 is pretty damn incredible. But the fact that the private markets are ready to be funded in this way is leading JP Morgan to believe that it's going to be possible. They estimate roughly 40% of new debt, 430 billion would come from bank loans and 60% from bond issuance. This is kind of what Oracle did with their corporate bonds a couple of weeks ago. Even with this increase, the tech industry's net debt to cash flow ratio would rise only from.7 to 1.2, still below the global average.</p>
</details>

摩根大通确实提醒说，能源基础设施而非融资，将是下一个主要瓶颈，因为AI数据中心的增长将推动巨大的新增电力需求。换句话说，能源股很可能会受到追捧，即使融资问题需要一些时间才能解决。这就是为什么我们继续看到能源股获得动力。Oklo在盘前交易中又上涨了3%，许多稀土股也表现不错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now JP Morgan did say you should be cautioned for energy infrastructure not financing as the next major bottleneck as the AI data center growth drives massive new power demand aka the energy stocks are likely going to catch a bid even if the financing of it is going to take some time for it to play out. So that is why you continue to see the energy names get the momentum that they get. Oaklo right here in the pre-markets up another 3% and a lot of those rare earth stocks are also pretty green as they were green in the overnight markets after going through you know relatively ugly red.</p>

如果你的投资逻辑是基于这些比特币矿商转型为数据中心，或者像Nebius、CoreWeave这样的公司，那么你的逻辑是相当有力的。问题在于你想以什么估值进入，以及你的时间线是什么。并非所有这些公司都会成为赢家，但如果需求远大于供给，那么你需要大量剩余需求流向一些并非像CoreWeave那样的大赢家，但它们仍将获得部分市场份额，这最终可能有助于它们的股价。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but you know that's bullish for Ian that's bullish for clean spark again if you have a thesis on these Bitcoin miners turn data centers or the nebuses or their core reeves of the world I mean your thesis is pretty strong the question is what valuation do you want to get into these guys and what is your timeline but the and you know not all of these guys are going to turn out to be winners but if there is way more demand than supply then you're going going to need a lot of residual demand going to some of the winners that are not as big of a winner as like a corewave, but they're still going to get some part of that market and that ultimately could help their stock price as well.</p>
</details>

说到Nebius，今天早上有一些传言。Nebius股价上涨了3%。其联合创始人Roman发布了一张照片，看起来公司正准备宣布其新数据中心之一的启动，很可能在英国或以色列。新数据中心将部署4000个GB200芯片来开启合作。这又是更多的扩张。如果Nebius能再拿到一个像微软那样的交易，那将非常利好。问题是这是否会实现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Speaking of Nebius, uh there were some rumors this morning, Nebius, right? They're up 3%. Data center uh in Israel and as a result uh you got this right here. The idea is, well, Roman, the co-founder, posted this picture, and it looks like the company is preparing to announce the launch of one of its new data centers, most likely in the UK or Israel. There'll be 4,000 GB200s to begin the partnership uh in one of those new data centers. Again, just more and more expansion. Nebas, if they can get another one of those Microsoft deals, would be very bullish. Question is if that will end up playing out.</p>
</details>

SMCI在盘前交易中也转绿了，有传言称其获得了XAI的合同。哇，上涨了5.4%。看来这个交易或传言正在发酵。彭博社报道称，关于SMCI获得XAI合同订单的说法正在流传。

<details>

<p class="english-text">SMCI, that one's going green in the pre-markets as well. Rumors of an XAI contract. Look at that. Wow. Up 5.4%. 4%. Uh so looks like that deal is or that rumor is coming out right now. SMCI talk of contract order from XAI circulating as per Bloomberg.</p>
</details>

这几乎是不可避免的。Jason和Chris已经说了一段时间了，如果我们卖出更多的**GPU**（Graphics Processing Unit: 图形处理器，AI计算的核心硬件），就需要更多的服务器机架来容纳这些GPU。上周戴尔（Dell）将财务指引的营收和利润都翻了一番，我认为这对SMCI来说是一个信号，他们最终也会这样做。SMCI在利润率方面并非世界上最好的股票，但它很可能会增长。他们为全球GPU提供的服务器机架和液冷技术的绝对数量必须增长。这个市场主要是他们、戴尔和惠普。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. I mean look, this is inevitable. Jason and Chris have been saying this for a while, which is that if we're going to sell more GPUs, you're going to need more server racks to be able to handle those GPUs. and Dell increasing their financial guidance double on the top and the bottom line last week was I think a signal for SMCI to eventually do the same. And so, you know, SMCI is not the the best stock in the world in terms of its margins for every incremental dollar it gets, but it likely will have to grow. Like the pure volume of the amount of server racks and liquid cooling technology they're going to be serving to these GPUs across the entire world has to grow. I mean, you it's them, Dell, and HP.</p>
</details>

我们也在美光身上看到了类似的情况。美光曾被视为大宗商品，股价在100美元徘徊了一段时间，然后需求上升，增长加速，他们开始拿出业绩，美光的估值就完全重估了。如果这种情况发生在SMCI身上，那将是令人兴奋的。

<p class="english-text">So, and and we kind of saw this with Micron. You know, Micron was deemed as a commodity, was stuck at 100 for a while, and then demand went up, growth went up, they started showing results, and Micron completely rerated. So, if that does happen with SMCI, which largely hasn't moved that much since liberation day, that would be exciting.</p>

### 宏观视角：区域银行、黄金与地缘政治

上周我们遇到了一些区域性金融问题。Western Alliance和Zions报告了一些不良贷款，给系统带来了一些冲击。但有图表显示，区域性银行并未崩溃。与私人信贷基金相关的信贷问题是孤立的，而净利息收入、信贷损失和资本状况看起来是多年来最强劲的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Meta right there, 723, Amazon 213, Reddit, that's up 3.3% back above 300 or 200. And then Palenteer 180 as well in the pre-markets, which is what we've got. All right, let's talk about some macro stats. So, first of all, last week we had some regional financial issues. Uh, Western Alliance and Zions reported a couple of faulty loans and that kind of sent some shocks to the system. Uh, here's a chart right here showing that regional banks are not breaking. If you look at credit issues tied to private credit funds, they're isolated while net interest income, credit losses, and capital look the strongest in years.</p>
</details>

另一件非常重要的事情是，Truist和其他几家周五公布财报的银行，其信贷拨备损失表现出色，远好于预期，比预期少了1到2亿美元。这与摩根大通和花旗银行的情况非常相似。因此，我认为区域性危机仍然局限于少数几家银行的个别不良贷款，并非私人信贷整体结构的系统性问题。只要情况如此，我认为这不会成为打破本轮牛市的看空理由。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And this is one of the charts that shows lending to non-d depository financials, as you can see right there, doesn't look like it's it's in a bad situation compared to historical averages that we've had with non-depository financials. The other thing that's really important about this is that the uh credit provision losses in Truist and a couple other banks that reported on Friday, they were great. They were way better than expected. Like way better. Like we're talking about 100 to $200 million less than what expected. It was very similar to to what JP Morgan and City Bank said. So I think the regional crisis again still continues to be isolated to a couple of banks that were that produced a couple of faulty loans. It is not endemic of the broader structure of private credit and as long as that's the case I think that is not going to be the the bare case that breaks this bull market.</p>
</details>

我认为还有很多其他事情可能打破这轮牛市，而不是区域性银行。但这确实是需要关注的事情，因为私人信贷绝对可能让事情变糟。只是目前除了少数一两家公司显示出问题外，没有足够的证据。因此，我不认为我们在区域性银行方面会有太多问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean there's I think plenty of other things that could break this bull market versus the regional banks but it is something to care about because you know private credit is definitely something that could make things bad. It's just there's not enough evidence outside of, you know, one company or two companies showing that there are some issues. So, as a result of that, I don't think we should have too many problems with the regional banks.</p>
</details>

KRE（区域性银行ETF）上周下跌了10%，今天上涨约1%，周五反弹了3%。如果我们不打算在私人信贷生态系统中遇到太多问题，这可能是一个机会。这对SoFi也非常利好。所以我决定在财报前买一些SoFi。我现在没有任何SoFi的持股，我考虑买500股。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">KRE, this thing was down 10% last week. It's up about 1%, recovered 3% on Friday. This one might be the opportunity if we're not going to have too many issues in the private private credit ecosystem. SoFi, also very bullish for SoFi. So, I decided I will be buying some SoFi before earnings. I don't own any SoFi right now. Um, I'm thinking 500 shares.</p>
</details>

简单的逻辑是，如果股价上涨，我想参与其中；如果下跌，我也会分担痛苦。不开玩笑了，我认为Tanner说得对，这将是一个创纪录的会员季度。我认为这些会员可能会转化为高于华尔街预期的净收入。我认为Noto有机会实现35%的增长季度，而华尔街预期是29%。如果他们能达到40%，我认为这将非常利好。最后，除了两家区域性银行外，所有银行都在大放异彩。SoFi将会表现出色，因为摩根大通、贝莱德、摩根士丹利等都表现出色。SoFi的规模比他们小，但增长率会更快、更好，而且他们的承销能力非常出色。更不用说加密货币市场正在复苏。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the simple logic is, well, I want to have fun if the stock goes up and I'll share in the misery if the stock goes down. I mean, no, in all seriousness, look, I think Tanner is right that there's going to be a record member quarter. I think those members are probably going to translate into net income that's higher than expected from the street. I think not has a chance to put up a 35% growth quarter. Street's expecting 29%. If they get to 40%, I think that'd be very bullish. And then finally, the banks are crushing it across the board outside of two regional banks. SoFi crushed it. I mean, SoFi will crush it because JP Morgan, Black Rockck, Morgan Stanley, etc. crushed it. SoFi is going to crush it on a smaller scale than those guys, but their rate of growth is going to be faster. It's gonna be better. And their underwriting is phenomenal. Not to mention cryptos coming back.</p>
</details>

我真的看不到SoFi的看空理由，至少目前是这样。而且降息也即将到来。所以我认为这将是一次500股的财报“赌博”，但我不认为财报会那么糟糕。如果股价下跌，那也是因为某些原因。如果财报好，那很可能是逢低买入的机会。但我认为我们可能会再次看到一个“三好”财报（triple beat），应该不会有太多问题。

<p class="english-text">I don't see the bare case on SoFi. I really don't like at this moment. I I don't see. And then you have rate cuts coming up. So, I think it's going to be a 500 share earnings yolo, but I I don't think we get that ugly of an earnings. And if the stock drops, then the stock drops for whatever reason. It would probably be a buy the dip if the earnings are good. But I think you're probably going to get another triple B and we shouldn't have that many issues.</p>
</details>

看空的理由是它在三个月内上涨了70%，这很公平。如果你想从估值和价格行为的角度来看空，那完全可以。但当一只股票通常这样做时，意味着它的下一次财报必须是完美的。我不是说SoFi的财报会完美，但感觉也不会是世界上最糟糕的财报。希望这能带来更多动力。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So, we're going to see what happens with SoFi, but that earnings will be happening over the next week. The bare case is that it rose 70% in three months, that is fair. If you want to make the bare case about valuation and price action, then 100%. But when a stock usually does that, that that that means that their next earnings has to be perfect. I'm not saying so far it's going to have a perfect earnings, but it doesn't feel like it's going to have the worst earnings in the world. And hopefully that can lead to some more momentum.</p>
</details>

此外，他们的财报发布日就在美联储做出决定前一天。所以，如果他们公布一个好的季度财报，然后一天后就降息，这可能会引爆行情。这取决于Noto的表现。这只股票要真正涨到35-40美元，需要他们的金融科技AWS——Galileo产品——开始实现超过10-12%的增长。我不认为这个季度会实现，但我认为Noto有一些选择可以给我们一个好的季度。如果这与降息同时发生，我认为不会太悲观。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Also, we were above 30 for a little bit, right? So, you know, maybe if it can normalize above that 30 going into rate cuts. Also, their earnings are a day before the Fed makes their decision. So, I mean, you get a good quarter and then you get rate cuts a day later. It could it could set up for something explosive, dude. It depends on how well not I mean the way this thing really gets up to 3540 is if AWS of fintech their Galileo product starts getting some more growth more than 10 12%. I don't think that's going to be this quarter but I think notto has some options to really give us a good quarter and if it does coinciding with the rate cuts I don't think that would be too bearish.</p>
</details>

说到银行，我确实有一个关于一家我不知道的银行的更新。许多法国观众可能知道这家公司，即使你不是法国人，如果你在欧洲，也可能知道。法国巴黎银行（BNP Paribas）今天经历了自2023年3月以来最糟糕的一天，下跌了10%。原因是联邦陪审团裁定该银行通过违反美国制裁，在苏丹协助种族灭绝，这引发了巨额或有负债和法律风险升级的威胁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh speaking of banks we do have one update on a bank that I did not know about. A lot of the French people in the audience might know about this company and even if you're not French, you know, if you if you're in Europe, uh BNP Parabos, which I'm probably saying the name wrong, had its worst day since March 2023. Was down 10% today. Why? A federal jury found the bank complicit in aiding genocide in Sudan by violating US sanctions, triggering the threat of large contingent liabilities and escalating legal risk.</p>
</details>

我之所以提到这个，是因为我想问：这是一个结构性问题，导致银行业出现问题吗？不。这是一家银行资助了他们不应该资助的东西。因此，很多客户——顺便说一句，这是法国最大的银行——会说：“嘿，我们不希望我们的钱与此有关。”现在你可能会遇到人们取出资产转移到别处的问题。但这会摧毁银行系统吗？不会。上周美国的Zions和Western Alliance损失了10亿美元市值，摧毁了银行系统吗？没有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Of course, I said it wrong. Of course. Oh, I said it right. Parabis. Parabus. You don't pronounce the S. Oh, it's probably true. You You don't pronounce the It's French, right? But, uh, so, you know, you do have some global banks that are not having the best time in the world. But again, you know, the reason I'm bringing this up is like, is this a structural reason the banking sector isn't an issue? No. This is one bank that ended up financing something that they were not supposed to be financing. And as a result, you got a lot of customers. This is the biggest bank in France, by the way. You got a lot of customers saying, "Hey, like we don't want our money associated with this." And now you might have some issues in terms of people taking out their assets and leaving somewhere else. Is it something that collapses the banking system? No. Did Zions and Western Alliance last week in the United States collap the banking system, losing a billion dollars in market cap? No.</p>
</details>

所以，你没有这些大规模的中国结构性问题，也没有这些大规模的银行业问题。降息即将到来，然后我们希望本周特斯拉和Netflix以及其他公司的财报会相当不错。牛市的理由看起来仍然很强劲，尽管市场一直很震荡。只要牛市的理由还有继续的空间，我认为到年底前市场不会那么激进。坦白说，我认为这实际上让今年的超额表现周期变得更容易，因为现在股票不在历史高点，你需要股票不在历史高点才能再上一层楼。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So again, you don't have these massive China structural issues. You don't have these massive banking issues. You've got rate cuts coming up and then we're hopefully going to have a pretty damn good earnings going into this week with Tesla and Netflix and a variety of other companies. the the bullcase still looks pretty strong as choppy as it's been and as long as that bullcase has room to continue then I don't think it's going to be that aggressive going into going into the end of the year and I think quite frankly it's actually making this year uh or this cycle for outperformance way easier because now stocks aren't at all-time highs and you kind of need stocks to not be at all-time highs to you know get another leg up. So, we're going to see how that plays out as we get into the end the end of this earning cycle.</p>

### 市场开盘：AWS故障引发交易混乱

好的，我们开始吧。感谢大家的到来。今天是10月20日，星期一。本月还剩11天。上午9:30，股市再次开盘。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, here we go. Thank you everybody for being here. It is Monday, October 20th. We got 11 days left of the month. 9:30 a.m. The stock market is once again open.</p>
</details>

标普500指数开盘上涨0.5%，报667.91点。记住，周五它在一天内上下波动了近50次。现在出现了一根巨大的绿色蜡烛，标普500指数达到668点。我们将看看这股势头能否保持。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, wake your ass up. Let's get into it. S&P 500 opens up.5% on the day. Green 66791. Remember on Friday it was up and down within like almost 50 uh 50 different green red opens across the board. There's a massive green candle right there. 668 on the S&P 500. We'll see if that holds any momentum or if that continues.</p>
</details>

哦，天哪。我的观察列表消失了。你们刚刚看到它消失了。让我们去看看Weeble。也许是AWS的问题。等等，你们的Weeble现在也有问题吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um but last week on Friday it went up. It went down. It went up and went down and then it completely got rearranged. So we're going to see if that holds on. Oh, Legend. You guys just saw my watch list disappear. You guys just saw it disappear. Let's go to Weeble. Maybe AWS. Wait, Weeble's having problems for you guys now as well.</p>
</details>

哦，让我看看。那些AWS的问题可能又回来了，但我们去看看Weeble。好的，标普还在动，668点。所以我们是绿色的，当天上涨了0.5%。SoFi 27.33美元，上涨约3%。SoFi的图表加载不出来。Robinhood的图表也加载不出来。哦，它们都宕机了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, let me see. Let me see. Those AWS issues might be back, but let's go to Weeble. Okay, S&P still moving 668. So, there you go. We are green. That's up half% of the day. SoFi 2733. That's up about 3%. SoFi chart not loading. SoFi chart not loading. Robin Hood chart not loading. Oh, they're all down. They're all down.</p>
</details>

天哪，兄弟。AWS，我以为问题已经解决了。它们应该在一小时前就修复了。我们刚才还在看图表。好吧，我想Robinhood回来了，或者Weeble挂了。Weeble挂了。Robinhood应该回来了。好的，标普上涨0.5%。AMD上涨2%。SoFi上涨3%。谷歌上涨0.5%。Grab上涨2%。比特币和以太坊分别回到11万美元和4000美元以上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Damn, bro. AWS, I thought the problems were resolved. They should have been fixed like an hour ago. I mean, they were fixed an hour. We were literally just looking at the chart like 30 seconds ago. Okay, I think Robin's back. I think Robin's back or Weeble's done. Weeble's done. Robin Hood should be back. Okay, S&P that's up.5%. AMD, that's up 2%. SoFi, that's up three. Google, that's up half percent. Grab that's up 2%. Bitcoin and Ethereum back over 4,000 and 110,000.</p>
</details>

Rocket Lab，我们在盘前没谈到，但交通部长在CNBC上说，SpaceX在最初授予他们的重返月球合同上落后了。所以他正在向任何太空公司开放合同竞标，包括Blue Origin。我想这就是Rocket Lab上涨3%的原因，因为如果他们竞标重返月球，对他们这种规模的公司来说将是一份巨大的合同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">TLT, that's up a little bit. Circle, that's up 2.5. Uh, Micro Strategy, that's up 2.97. YouTube just crashed for you a minute ago. Wow. Yeah, you're getting a bunch of different issues throughout the day. Roblox, that's up 1%. Crowd Strike, that's up 1.3. Rocket Lab, okay, there was something we didn't talk about in the pre-markets, but the secretary of um the secretary of transportation came on CNBC in the pre-markets and uh he said that SpaceX is behind on the contract that was initially awarded to them to get back to the moon. And so, he is opening up the contract for any space company to bid, including Blue Origin. And I think that's why Rocket Lab is up 3% right here because if they bid to potentially get back to the moon, I mean that would be a massive contract for a company of their scale.</p>
</details>

很多券商都出了问题。很奇怪，但至少Legend现在没有太大的问题。英特尔37.93美元。迪士尼小幅上涨。Square小幅上涨。Duolingo刚刚转跌。DoorDash上涨约1%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know, Sean Duffy, he didn't hesitate to say that SpaceX is being slow and it was kind of a public call out for other companies to compete for this. So that could be a reason why Rocklab's getting some momentum. ESTs as well. This was 84 in the pre-markets. 8649 that is also green. A lot of you guys are having some issues across the brokerages. very weird, but at least Legend is not messing up too badly right now. Intel, that's at 37.93. Disney's up a little bit. Square is up a little bit. Duolingo just went red. Door Dash, that's up about 1%.</p>
</details>

难道所有东西都运行在AWS上吗？天哪。IREN股价61.49美元，上涨1.3%。区域性银行可能也是绿色的，但它们加载不出来。Weeble也加载不出来任何东西。天哪，AWS控制着互联网。这太疯狂了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Redcap, that's up 3.2. How about I the Bitcoin miners? It's barely searching for me, dude. It's not even pulling up a ticker. Yahoo's down, too. Does everything run on AWS? Goodness gracious. 61.49 on Iran. That's up 1.3. Regionals are, if they're ever going to load, probably green, but they're not going to load. Uh, let me go back to Weeble and see if we can load something up. Weeble is not loading anything either. Damn, bro. AWS controls the internet. This is wild. This is wild.</p>

### 市场观察：大盘反弹与“垃圾股”退潮的健康信号

标普指数，看那个。668点，朋友们。如果我们能回到670点，历史高点是673点，那是在整个中国灾难开始之前。那发生在两周前。我的意思是，673点并不遥远。如果我们能回到670点以上，那将是非常好的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">S&P though, look at that. 668, folks. If we get back to 670, all-time highs were 673 before this whole China disaster started in regards to the back and forth of rhetorical, I guess, insults towards one another, which have started to deescalate. That happened two weeks ago. I mean, 673 is not that far away. If we can get back above 670, that would be very nice to see.</p>
</details>

标普指数670点。即使今天有各种小插曲，她还是回来了。标普670点。再涨3美元，我们就回到历史高点了。好消息是，我们没有看到那些乱七八糟的股票上涨。我不是冒犯，只是说一些可能不应该在一年内上涨7000%的股票。Oklo下跌5%，而标普上涨1%。我认为这是健康的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">S&P, are we at 670? Wow. 670. S&P, she's back even with all the hiccups today. 670 on the S&P. Three more bucks and we are back to all-time highs. Uh, and the good thing is we're not really seeing stupid stocks run. And again, I I don't mean stupid in an offensive way. I just mean a little offensive, but not just saying like some of these names that probably didn't deserve to go up 7,000% in a year. Oaklo is down 5% while the S&P is up 1%. I think that's healthy.</p>
</details>

我认为这很健康。还有什么随机股票的名字？SMR，NuScale Power。是的，NuScale下跌4%。SMR下跌79%。还有哪些无缘无故上涨的股票，我们不希望看到它们上涨？所有的量子计算概念股都在下跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that is healthy. What's another name of a random stock? SMR. Nanuclear. Yeah, Nanuclear down 4%. SMR down 79%. What are what are some other names that ran up for no reason that we don't want to see them going up? I mean, all all the quantum names are down.</p>
</details>

伙计，这实际上非常利好。因为如果量子计算股在标普创新高的同时又开始疯涨，你会说，“好吧，每个人都在冲进去买所有东西，这又是一个小丑市场。”但看到那些股票保持下跌，而人们购买像标普、英伟达、谷歌这样的优质资产，这是利好的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Dude, this is actually really bullish because if freaking Quantum started going back to the moon at the same time as the S&P, you would say, "Okay, everyone's just running in to to buy everything and it's it's a clown market again." But seeing those names stay down and people buy quality like the S&P, like Nvidia, like Google, that's bullish.</p>
</details>

### 最后的思考与展望

好了，伙计们。今天就到这里。希望收盘时情况会好很多。我认为今天的故事是：苹果创历史新高，AMD创历史新高，英伟达试图突破回到185美元，标普指数复苏，而那些随机的、泡沫化的股票没有以与高质量公司相同的速度上涨，同时中国方面的情况从昨晚开始显著缓和。我认为这是利好的。考虑到九天后我们就要降息，这真的非常利好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, folks. Uh, I think that is it for the day. Hopefully during the market close, it'll get a lot better. I think story of the day is Apple all-time highs, AMD all-time highs, Nvidia trying to break out back to the 185 and then the S&P recovering while the random frothy stocks are not moving at the same velocity as high quality companies and the China stuff is deescalating pretty significantly from last night. I think that's bullish. I think it's really freaking bullish knowing that in nine days we get a rate cut.</p>
</details>

所以，本周有特斯拉和Netflix的财报，下周有降息，下周有特朗普和习近平的会晤，可能还有特朗普和金正恩的会晤。然后，基于我们看到的所有财报，更广泛的AI资本支出顺风似乎没有放缓。希望在未来几天，我们将看到这些财报继续向好，市场在没有大量泡沫股跟涨的情况下复苏。对我来说，这是进入财报季的一个相当不错的故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you got Tesla and Netflix this week. You got a rate cut next week. You got Trump and Xi next week, potentially Trump and Kim Jong-un. Um, and then you have the broader AI capex tailwind that doesn't seem to be slowing down based on all the earnings we've seen. And hopefully in the next coming days, we're going to see those earnings continue along with the market recovering without a lot of the frothy names going up with it. I mean, that to me is a pretty decent story going into earnings. Pretty decent story going to earnings.</p>
</details>

另外，Cactus Jack已经正式全职加入了AK Media。所以如果你们在聊天室看到他，他会帮助我准备节目主题和所有这些东西。他已经在聊天室里待了一年了，所以很高兴能有他全职加入，这有望让我更高效地获取突发新闻，也希望能帮助其他需要这些信息的人。

<p class="english-text">Three updates. I said this last night. I'll just say uh reiterate them here and then we'll be done for the day. Uh Cactus Jack again, he has officially joined the stream uh full-time or joined AK Media full-time. So, if you guys see him in the chat, he will be helping me with the show topics, prepping all this stuff and uh you know, he's been in the chat for the past year. So, really happy to have him full-time and it'll hopefully just make me a lot more efficient at getting breaking news and hopefully help everyone else who needs a lot of that breaking news to get through the day. So, we got Cactus on the team.</p>
</details>

第二，我昨晚说了，粉丝见面会将在2026年回归。我正在寻找一个能真正帮助我进行策划、安保、后勤、基础设施等所有环球旅行和举办活动所需事宜的组织。我想我找到了我想要的人。所以，如果事情敲定，我会在11月底告诉大家最新进展。

<p class="english-text">Number two, I said this last night, the meetups are coming back in 2026. I had a really good meeting with a management agency on uh Saturday and uh we have not officially signed a deal, but essentially I'm looking for an organization that can really help me with planning, security, logistics, infrastructure, all the stuff that it takes to travel across the world and throw these events. And uh I think I I think I found the people I'm looking for. So I will let you guys know updates on if that gets done probably end of November. But I have a pretty good feeling about it. And uh the person who set this up is someone that I met in Miami who has 40 years of event planning experiences. He owns multiple nightclubs. So it's it's a really good mix in terms of the type of people I'm looking for. And the meetup should be coming back next year. And I think it'll be really exciting because the meetups have been pretty successful in 2025 and I think we can take them to the next level next year.</p>
</details>

最后是关于Substack的更新。我非常感谢订阅的人，这对我意义重大。我爱上了写作，从未想过我会这么说，但出于某种原因，我非常享受写作的过程。这对我来说像是一个新的挑战。我想我已经说了这么多年话，正在寻找一种新的表达方式，而书面文字，我真的从未想过我会成为一个作家，它让我着迷。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And then um yeah, the final update is just the Substack. I really appreciate people subscribing to it. Really means a lot to me. I am falling in love with writing. I never thought I would say that, but for some reason I I really enjoy the process of writing. It's just like it's kind of a new challenge for me. I think I think I've been talking for so many years that I was looking for a new way to express myself and I guess the written word, which I genuinely never thought I would become a writer. It's it it's fascinated me. Absolutely fascinated me.</p>
</details>

我们在Substack上大约有12000人订阅，这意义重大。前两篇深度分析是关于Duolingo和BMR。我认为在这个平台上，除了深入分析公司，我还能发布更多内容。比如当Robinhood发布财报时，我想写下我对财报的所有想法，那将是对Robinhood财报的深度分析。所以，我认为有很多内容希望大家能喜欢。对于那些真正喜欢阅读研究报告的人来说，这是我们将要做的新的尝试。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, yeah, we have about 12,000 people that subscribed on Substack really means a lot. Dualingo BMR for the first two deep dives. I think there's a lot more content that I'll be able to put on this platform outside of just deep diving into companies. Like when Robin Hood has their earnings and I want to write up all my thoughts on those earnings, that'll be a deep dive into Robin Hood's earnings. So, I think there's a lot of content that hopefully people will be able to enjoy. And uh for those that really like reading research, this is uh this is the new one we're going to be doing. So, you guys can subscribe there. It is free. No payw wall. There won't never be a payw wall. And uh we'll keep going from there.</p>
</details>

我已经开始着手准备下两篇深度分析了。周六我就在想，“好了，是时候开始下一个了。”我不知道，兄弟，我正在进入我的作家时代。也许我会成为一个作家，也许我会写一本书。也许我需要写一本关于如何变得有趣的书。也许这就是未来的方向。谁知道呢？我们拭目以待。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I already started working on the next two deep dives. I already started working on it. Literally Saturday I was like, "All right, time to work on the next one."

Maybe that would, you know, maybe that's maybe that's where this takes me. Who knows? We're gonna see. We're gonna see what happens. But, um, no, I really do like writing and we're going to keep doing it over the coming years and see it see it go from there.</p>

好了，今天就到这里。感谢大家。我们收盘时再见。希望Robinhood、Weeble和AWS的问题能得到解决。澳大利亚总理将在大约30分钟后与特朗普会面，我们将关注进展。我们看看标普500指数今天能否收于670点以上。再次感谢大家。我们收盘时见。再见。
