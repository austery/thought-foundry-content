### 势场之争：从经典力学到量子谜团

在物理学的传统观念中，粒子行为的改变通常归因于电场、磁场或引力场等**力场**（Force Field: 描述空间中力分布的矢量场）的作用。然而，这一根深蒂固的认知在20世纪50年代受到了挑战。两位物理学家提出了一项巧妙的实验，揭示了即使在完全没有电场或磁场的区域，通过简单的开关操作，电子的行为也能被改变。这一发现震惊了物理学界，引发了关于**场**（Field: 描述物理量在空间中分布的物理概念）是否是基本实体，以及一个曾被视为抽象数学工具的**势**（Potential: 与力场相关的标量或矢量函数）是否更接近现实核心的深刻讨论。

追溯历史，**势**这一概念最初是为了解决物理学中最棘手的未解难题之一——**三体问题**（Three-Body Problem: 预测三个相互引力作用的物体运动轨迹的问题）而引入的。与牛顿在三百多年前轻松解决的**二体问题**（Two-Body Problem: 预测两个相互引力作用的物体运动轨迹的问题）不同，当引入第三个物体时，整个系统变得异常复杂。在二体系统中，力总是指向共同的质心，行为可预测；但在三体系统中，力的计算变得极其动态和混乱，不仅要考虑力的大小，还要顾及其方向，导致了长达一个世纪的失败尝试。直到18世纪70年代，**约瑟夫·路易斯·拉格朗日**（Joseph Louis Lagrange: 18世纪法国数学家、天文学家，拉格朗日力学的奠基人）提出了一种全新的方法来简化这一问题。他设想为恒星周围空间的每个点赋予一个数值，这个数值由恒星质量和与恒星的距离决定，可以将其想象成高度。通过将这些数值转化为等高线图，拉格朗日发展出了**引力势V**（Gravitational Potential V: 描述引力场中单位质量物体所具有势能的标量场）。值得注意的是，势是一个**标量**（Scalar: 只有大小没有方向的物理量），而非**矢量**（Vector: 既有大小又有方向的物理量）。拉格朗日的天才之处在于，他发现可以在任何一点绘制一个直接指向“下坡”的箭头，箭头的长度对应于该点的“坡度”。通过在每个点重复这个过程，并转换到二维视角，我们便得到了恒星的引力场。数学上，引力场G等于引力势V的负梯度，这提供了一种在矢量和标量之间切换问题的方法，极大地简化了计算。

Imagine you are in empty space and you fire off a stream of electrons. Well then according to most physics textbooks, the only way to change how those electrons behave is by applying an electric or magnetic or gravitational force to them. But most physics textbooks are wrong. In the 1950s, two physicists came up with a clever experiment. You could have electrons travel through a region with no electric or magnetic fields whatsoever, and yet by flipping a switch, you could change their behavior. The magnetic field could be just zero, and yet the presence of some quantity could actually lead to observable effects. That wasn't supposed to happen, right? This experiment split the physics community in two. It made them question whether fields are fundamental or whether something that was supposed to be just an abstract mathematical tool was actually more core to reality.

This tool was first introduced in an attempt to solve one of the hardest unsolved problems in physics. The three body problem. That is, if you have three bodies and you know their initial positions and velocities, how will they move under the influence of each other's gravity? It's a juicy, juicy problem, which has occupied literally generations, hundreds and hundreds of years of incredibly ambitious, talented mathematicians, physicists, and astronomers, and, and and beyond. The fact that this problem is so difficult to solve should at least be a little surprising because if you have just two bodies, then the solution is easy to find. In fact, the general case was already solved over 300 years ago by Newton himself. But when Newton added a third body, well, that's when everything fell apart. In the two body case, the forces behaved predictably, always pointing toward's the system's shared center of mass. But with three bodies, this is no longer the case. When you try to calculate the forces, they end up being extremely dynamic. In addition to worrying about the magnitude of the forces, you also have to worry about their direction. So you end up with this chaotic mess of vectors for the next hundred years, everyone who tried to solve this problem failed.

But what if there was some other way to approach it, a way to simplify the math and not have to worry about these three dimensional vectors? Well, that's where Joseph Louis Lagrange comes in. In the 1770s, he was also trying to solve the three body problem, and he came up with a new approach. It works something like this. Say you've got a single mass like a star Lagrange imagined assigning a value to each point in space around the star. The value is determined by the star's mass and the distance from the star. You can think of each value as a height, and if we then turn this into an altitude map, you can see how the star creates this sort of well. What Lagrange had developed was the gravitational potential V, and what's important to note is that V is a scalar. It has a magnitude but no direction. So the genius in Lagrange's idea is this. At any given point, we can draw an arrow pointing directly downhill where the size of the arrow corresponds to the steepness of the hill at that point, we can repeat this process at every point. And if we then shift our perspective to two dimensions, look, what we've got is the gravitational field of the star. Mathematically, we say that the gravitational field G is equal to the negative gradient of V.

### 拉格朗日力学与电磁势的演进

**拉格朗日**的方法提供了一种在矢量和标量之间转换问题的方法，使得矢量求和的复杂性被简化为标量求和的直观性。通过简单地叠加各个物体的势，可以构建出任何数量物体的组合势能景观，并根据需要从中推导出作用力。以地球绕太阳运行的二体系统为例，其组合势能景观中存在五个梯度为零的点，即**拉格朗日点**（Lagrange Points: 在两个大天体引力作用下，第三个小物体可以保持相对静止的五个空间点）。在这些点上，物体可以保持稳定的轨道，前提是不受外界干扰。尽管拉格朗日点未能直接解决三体问题，但拉格朗日在此过程中发展出了更为精密的工具，甚至开创了一种全新的力学方法——**拉格朗日力学**（Lagrangian Mechanics: 一种基于能量而非力的分析力学方法）。

要实现这种新力学，不仅需要**势**，还需要**势能**（Potential Energy: 物体因其在力场中的位置而具有的能量）和**动能**（Kinetic Energy: 物体因其运动而具有的能量）。虽然势和势能概念相似，但存在细微差别：势通常指单个物体周围的场，而势能则需引入第二个物体来计算。例如，太阳的引力势V等于-GM/r，而地球的引力势能U则是势V乘以地球质量。结合动能（1/2 MV²），我们可以构建出**拉格朗日量**（Lagrangian: 动能减去势能的物理量），并将其代入**欧拉-拉格朗日方程**（Euler-Lagrange Equation: 拉格朗日力学中的核心方程，用于推导运动方程），从而求解系统运动。例如，用传统力学方法预测双摆运动极其困难，因为一个摆的运动会影响另一个摆的参照系。但通过欧拉-拉格朗日方程，可以迅速得出数值解。这种基于能量的标量方法，使得即使不是顶尖物理学家也能推导出正确的运动方程。

尽管拉格朗日的方法极大地简化了许多问题，但它未能解决三体问题。1887年，数学家**海因里希·布伦斯**（Heinrich Bruns: 德国数学家，证明了三体问题在一般情况下不可解）最终证明三体问题是不可解的，因为未知数过多且无法简化。至此，最好的方法只能是计算机模拟，通过实时计算势来预测系统演化。然而，势的引入不仅简化了引力问题，也促使物理学家思考自然界中其他力是否也有对应的势，首当其冲便是**电力**（Electric Force: 带电粒子之间相互作用的力）。19世纪10年代，拉格朗日的学生**西蒙·丹尼斯·泊松**（Simeon Denis Poisson: 法国数学家、物理学家，在电磁学和力学方面有重要贡献）注意到电力公式与引力公式的相似性，并定义了**电势φ**（Electric Potential φ: 描述电场中单位正电荷所具有势能的标量场）。与引力不同的是，电荷既能吸引也能排斥，因此电势景观中既有“坑”也有“山”。

So Lagrange had found a way to switch the problem back and forth between one of vectors and one of scalars. And while adding up vectors is hard, adding scalars is a piece of cake. To find the combined potential landscape of any number of bodies, you just add up their individual potentials and then you can always use that to get back to forces if you want. For a simple two body system like the earth orbiting the sun, that combined potential looks something like this. If you look closely, you see that there are five points where the gradient is zero. And so Lagrange realized the forces there are also zero, which means that at each of these points, you could place a tiny third body and it would maintain a perfectly stable orbit. That is if it isn't disturbed. These points are now known as the Lagrange points. And while they didn't help solve the three body problem, Lagrange was developing more sophisticated tools. In fact, he developed an entirely new way of doing mechanics. But for that to work, he didn't just need the potential, he needed the potential energy and the kinetic energy too.

I think when people hear potential, they think potential energy. And while they're very similar, there is a subtle difference. If you have the potential that's basically the field corresponding to a single body, then it will have some potential field around it, which is described as V equals minus GM over r, where this is the mass of the sun. But to get the potential energy we need to add in a second body. So let's say that's the earth. The potential energy, let's call it U, is basically just the potential times the mass of the second body. So they're very similar, but they're slightly different. And the kinetic energy of the earth is simple. That's of course one half MV squared. So now we have everything we need to try this new method. In fact, we made a whole video on this over a year ago, but for now, all we need to know is that we can write down the kinetic minus potential energy to find what's known as the Lagrangian. Then you sub that into the so-called Euler-Lagrange equation, and out comes your solution. For example, predicting the motion of a double pendulum by using this standard forces approach is infamously hard. Because as one pendulum is swinging, it provides the attachment point for the pendulum hanging below it. And so that pendulum is in this moving reference frame as it's swinging. But if you plug the kinetic and potential energy into the Euler-Lagrange equation, then you can quickly get to a solution at least numerically. That's actually how we made this simulation. I remember thinking, man force is like hard to get the right answer. You can do it if you're good, and people who are good at mechanics can do it. But with the Lagrangian approach, you could just write down the energy, which is a scalar, not a vector, plug it into the Euler-Lagrange equation, and you get the right equation of motion and you don't have to be a good physicist.

But for all its usefulness, the potential wasn't enough to help Lagrange solve the three body problem. In 1887, mathematician Heinrich Bruns finally proved that the three body problem is unsolvable. There are simply too many unknowns and no way to simplify the problem to reduce them. So the best we've got are computer simulations, which compute the potentials from moment to moment, and use that to predict how the system will evolve in time. And so that's where we come to realize that the three body problem is beautiful for what it's taught us. Even though we now recognize that we can't actually solve for this exact problem as as many folks had hoped to do. And in doing that, they merely gave us the machinery of modern mathematical physics. So I'm pretty happy they tried. The potential helped simplify a wide array of problems. For many physicists it even replaced forces as their primary tool. It became so useful that people started to wonder if other forces in nature might have a corresponding potential, starting with the electric force. If you look at the formula for the electric force, you notice that it's remarkably similar to that for gravity, just with masses and charges swapped. In the 1810s, Simeon Denis Poisson, one of Lagrange's students, also noticed the similarity and he realized that you can define an electric potential phi in a very similar way. But there is one important difference, and that is while two masses can only attract, two charges can attract or repel. So now with the potential you don't only get pits, you also get hills.

### 磁矢量势与势的物理实在性争议

然而，**磁力**（Magnetic Force: 磁场对运动电荷或磁性材料施加的力）的势则更为复杂，因为它与引力和电力有着根本性的不同。磁场线是闭合的回路，没有起点或终点，这使得传统的标量势无法描述磁场。19世纪40年代，大学生**威廉·汤姆逊**（William Thompson: 后来的**开尔文勋爵**，英国物理学家，在热力学和电磁学方面有卓越贡献）取得了突破。他发现当时的数学工具无法描述磁场与其相关势之间的关系，于是他发明了一个全新的函数——**旋度**（Curl: 描述矢量场中一点旋转趋势的矢量算子）。通过旋度，汤姆逊将**磁矢量场B**（Magnetic Vector Field B: 描述磁场强度和方向的矢量场）定义为另一个**矢量场**——**磁矢量势A**（Magnetic Vector Potential A: 一个矢量场，其旋度等于磁场）的旋度。尽管A和B都是矢量场，但A通常比B更容易处理，就像引力势V和电势φ一样。汤姆逊的发现揭示了一种潜在的数学结构，能够简化计算，但他本人仍认为这只是一种有用的数学工具，而非物理实在的替代品。

随着**开尔文勋爵**（Lord Kelvin: 威廉·汤姆逊的爵位名称）的贡献，物理学中建立了三个基本方程，将势与其各自的场联系起来，极大地简化了问题求解。自此，专业物理学家在解决问题时，常常使用势而非力或场。势甚至出现在我们一些最优秀的宇宙物理理论中。但这引出了一个重要问题：如果势无处不在，它们是否真正代表了某种物理实在，即它们能否直接影响现实？对大多数物理学家而言，答案是响亮的“不”。以单个恒星的引力势为例，我们可以随意给势的每个值加上一个常数（例如10、100、100万），这会改变整个势能景观的绝对高度，但从一点到另一点的景观变化（即坡度）保持不变。因此，引力场、物体所受的力以及系统的演化方式都不会改变。对于任何引力场，我们都可以用无限多种方式来描述其引力势，而系统的演化结果却相同。电学和磁学也同样如此：场的数值和力是固定的，但势的数值却是任意的。基于此，大多数物理学家得出结论：势不可能具有任何物理意义，它只是一个简化数学的技巧。然而，这一普遍观点可能被证明是错误的。

But one force was much trickier to find the potential for, and that was the magnetic force. And that's because magnetism is a fundamentally different beast from the gravitational and electric force. Take a bar magnet, we can draw the magnetic field it produces. It looks something like this. Now at first glance, this looks very similar to the electric scenario where we have a positive and negative charge, but this picture doesn't look at what's going on inside the magnet. So if we reveal what's inside then you see that these lines actually continue, but now they point from south to north. So magnetic field lines are actually loops. They don't have an origin or endpoint, and that fundamentally changes things. So physicists need a new way to describe the magnetic potential. The breakthrough came in the 1840s from an undergraduate student named William Thompson. His day job as an undergraduate was to learn as much fancy calculus as possible. And then when he learned that he invented more. Thompson found that the mathematics of his day was unable to describe the relationship between a magnetic field and its associated potential. So he came up with an entirely new function, the curl. To see how this works, imagine the arrows of this vector field are like currents in a liquid. If we were to place a paddle wheel right here, it would start to rotate rapidly counterclockwise. As Thompson defined it, this spot has high positive curl, at this spot, it would rotate clockwise, but not as rapidly, so it has lower negative curl. And here the current pushes on it equally in both directions, so it wouldn't rotate at all. This spot has zero curl. Thompson realized that the magnetic vector field B could be defined as the curl of some other vector field, the magnetic vector potential A. Now, even though they're both vector fields, it turns out that A is often much easier to work with than the magnetic field itself, much like the other potentials V and phi, Thompson was showing there was a kind of underlying mathematical structure one could use that would streamline the calculations, but even Thompson thought this was a kind of device, a helpful device, and not a substitute for like the real physics.

Decades later, Thompson was elevated to the House of Lords for his contributions to science where he received a new title, Lord Kelvin, with Kelvin's latest edition. There were now three fundamental equations relating the potentials to their respective fields. Thanks to each of these, you could now solve problems much easier. And so ever since professional physicists often use potentials instead of forces or fields to solve the problems they're working on. Potentials even show up in some of our best physical theories of the universe. But that raises an important question. If potentials pop up everywhere, then do they actually represent anything physical, that is, can they have a direct influence on reality? Well, to most physicists, the answer was a resounding no. Take the gravitational potential of a single star, for example. Well, we could just add 10 to each value of the potential, and this would shift the overall landscape. But the change in landscape from one point to the next remains the exact same. So the field is the same as the one we had before, and the force and object would experience at any point would remain unchanged. In fact, we can add any constant 10, a hundred, a million, and the field doesn't change. And so the forces an object would experience going around it also don't change. There are an infinite number of ways we could write the gravitational potential for any gravitational field and get the system to evolve in the same way. And the same is true for electricity and magnetism. The value of the field and thus the force is fixed, but the value of the potential is arbitrary. So from this, most physicists concluded that potentials can possibly have any physical significance. It must just be a trick that makes the math easier, but most physicists might be wrong.

### 阿哈罗诺夫与玻姆效应的理论基石

1942年，23岁的**戴维·玻姆**（David Bohm: 美国理论物理学家，以其对量子力学的非正统解释和意识理论而闻名）正在撰写他的粒子物理学博士论文，却意外卷入了**曼哈顿计划**（Manhattan Project: 二战期间美国研发原子弹的秘密计划）。尽管他的导师**罗伯特·奥本海默**（Robert Oppenheimer: 美国理论物理学家，曼哈顿计划的科学主任）极力推荐，但由于玻姆曾短暂加入美国共产党，被**莱斯利·格罗夫斯将军**（General Leslie Groves: 曼哈顿计划的军事负责人）视为安全风险，禁止参与该项目。更糟的是，他的博士论文主题被列为机密，他甚至无法接触自己的研究成果。最终，在奥本海默的担保下，玻姆才于1943年获得博士学位。战后，玻姆在**普林斯顿大学**（Princeton University: 位于美国新泽西州普林斯顿的私立研究型大学）任教，但共产主义同情者的指控如影随形。1949年，他被传唤至众议院非美活动委员会接受质询，普林斯顿大学也因此暂停了他的教职。即使后来被判无罪，大学仍拒绝恢复他的职位。在奥本海默的建议下，玻姆离开了美国，先后前往巴西和以色列。尽管摆脱了政治压力，他却因其非正统的量子力学解释和人类意识理论，在学术界仍被视为异类。

然而，有一位学生对玻姆的理念深感兴趣，他就是**亚基尔·阿哈罗诺夫**（Yakir Aharonov: 以色列物理学家，与玻姆共同提出了阿哈罗诺夫-玻姆效应）。当玻姆再次迁居到英国**布里斯托大学**（University of Bristol: 位于英国布里斯托尔的公立研究型大学）时，阿哈罗诺夫也随他而去。正是在20世纪50年代的布里斯托，两人偶然发现了一个重大现象。根据**量子力学**（Quantum Mechanics: 描述微观粒子行为的物理理论），最小的粒子表现出波的特性，其行为由**薛定谔方程**（Schrödinger Equation: 量子力学中的基本方程，描述波函数随时间演化）支配。该方程的解是**波函数ψ**（Wave Function ψ: 描述量子系统中粒子状态的数学函数），其模的平方代表了在给定时间和地点找到粒子的概率密度。薛定谔方程的左侧描述波函数随时间和空间的变化，右侧则表明这种变化取决于**哈密顿量**（Hamiltonian: 描述系统总能量的算符）。当存在电势和磁势时，薛定谔方程的解包含一个描述**复相位**（Complex Phase: 波函数中的角度部分，影响波的干涉行为）的项。这个相位项中包含了磁矢量势A和电势φ。当磁矢量势A与电子运动方向相同时，波函数会伸展，相位随空间变化变慢；反之，如果势方向相反，波函数会压缩，相位变化加快。电势φ的变化也会产生类似的效果。

起初，大多数物理学家认为这并不令人震惊，因为在薛定谔方程中使用势只是为了简化数学，真正的变化仍由场引起。但阿哈罗诺夫对此持有不同看法。他认为，薛定谔方程中直接出现的是势而非电场E，这意味着势包含了场无法提供的额外信息。因为对于一个特定的电场，可以定义无限多个势（通过加上任意常数），而这些特异性信息在从势转换为场时会丢失。阿哈罗诺夫推测，每个量子系统实际上都是受势而非场的影响。为了证明这一点，他需要设计一个实验，让粒子穿过一个没有电场或磁场但存在势的区域。如果粒子波函数的相位开始变慢或变快，那必然是势本身直接作用的结果，因为没有场的存在。

In 1942, 23-year-old David Bohm was hard at work on his thesis in particle physics when one day he received an unexpected visit. Robert Oppenheimer, who was David Bohm's PhD advisor, wanted to bring him squarely onto the new Manhattan project efforts. This was a life-changing opportunity. Bohm would be working side by side with some of the top minds in physics, but there was a problem. The project's military director General Leslie Groves had to approve Oppenheimer's recruits. And when he ran a background check on B, he didn't like what he saw. He briefly joined the American branch of the Communist Party when he was in California by his own recollections, he quit pretty quickly 'cause he got bored. He said, these people just sit around talking all day and don't do anything. Even so Groves deemed Bohm a security risk and banned him from working on the Manhattan Project. But things got even worse just as he was about to finish his dissertation in Berkeley, the topic was then classified. He did not have clearance, so he couldn't even work on or even write up his own dissertation. So Oppenheimer had to certify that Bohm had done good work. And in 1943 in wartime, that was sufficient for Bohm to actually get a PhD. After the war, Bohm became an assistant professor at Princeton University, but fears surrounding his communist sympathies followed him wherever he went. In 1949, he was brought before the house on American Activities Committee for questioning. While Bohm was under investigation, Princeton let his professorship lapse, and even after he was acquitted, the university refused to reinstate him. It seemed that Bohm was destined for obscurity. And so Oppenheimer gave him a firm recommendation, leave the country and start fresh somewhere else. Oppenheimer was no stranger to political persecution, and he didn't want Bohm to suffer the same fate. So Bohm took the advice, his journeys brought him to Brazil and then Israel. And though he was free from the political pressures he had felt in America, he still found himself an outcast. Many of Bohm's academic peers were put off by his more unorthodox ideas, including his radical interpretation of quantum mechanics and his new theory of human consciousness. But there was one student who was enthralled by Bohm's approach, and that was Yakir Aharonov.

When Bohm relocated once more. This time, moving to the University of Bristol in England, Aharonov chose to come with him, and it was there in Bristol in the 1950s that Aharonov and Bohm stumbled upon something huge. According to quantum mechanics, at the smallest particles behave like waves, and this behavior is governed by the Schrodinger equation. The solution to this equation is called the wave function psi. If you take its modulus squared, you get the probability density of finding a particle at a given point, at a given time. The left side of this equation tells you how the wave function changes over time and space, and the right side tells you that this change depends on hitch, what is known as the Hamiltonian. It's basically just the total energy of the system. In the case where we have both an electric and magnetic potential, the solution to the Schrodinger equation looks something like this, where this is just a constant. And this term describes the complex phase. It looks complicated, but it's actually quite easy to get a feel for it. So let's plot it in two dimensions for an electron. Moving to the right, the different colors here represent the different phases, and you can see how the phase evolves over time and space. Thank you to Richard Behiel for inspiring this approach. Now, if you look closely at the original phase term, you see A and phi, the magnetic and electric potentials. So watch what happens if we add a magnetic vector potential that points in the same direction as the electron is traveling. You can see that the wave stretches out. So now the phase changes more slowly over space than it did before. And if the potential points the other way, then now the wave gets more compressed and its phase changes faster over space. And a similar thing would happen if you change the electric potential phi. Now, this by itself, I think wasn't shocking to most physicists, just as you would always use the potentials to make the math easier. That's also why you use it in the Schrodinger equation. But really what's responsible for these, you know, even phase changes were still the fields. But you spoke to Aharonov. Yeah And that wasn't his take. No. If you look at the Schrodinger equation, you can't just replace the potential phi with the electric field E. Why not? Because you're losing information. Okay? Because remember, you can define any number of potentials for a specific electric field because you can pick an arbitrary height, but that information is lost when you go and swap it out for the electric field. There's another way to think about it. Okay, okay, it's getting real. So if you have an expression like five x squared plus five, you'd think you could just write this as the integral of 10 X, right? Because the integral is five x squared plus C. C, right? C is a constant. So it includes five, but it also includes any other number. But importantly, C is not five, or at least not in every case. So you lose this specificity when you grow from a potential to an electric field. And Aharonov wasn't comfortable with that. So he thought, what if every quantum system was actually influenced by the potential and not by the field, right? So it's the potential that shows up in the Schrodinger equation. So it is what influences wave functions. He had to find a way to prove that what we're observing is always because of a potential and not because of the field. How do you do that complicated? See, Aharonov had to design an experiment that would send a particle through a region where there's no electric or magnetic field, but there is a potential in such a setup. If the phase of the particles wave function started changing slower or faster, that had to be the direct result of the potential itself because there are no fields,

### 阿哈罗诺夫-玻姆效应：无场区的相位之谜

直接测量粒子波函数的相位是不可能的，这给实验设计带来了挑战。**阿哈罗诺夫**（Aharonov）寻求导师**玻姆**（Bohm）的帮助，两人共同构想了一个理论实验：首先，一束电子被分成两束；在两束电子之间放置一个紧密缠绕的线圈，即**螺线管**（Solenoid: 一种通电后内部产生均匀磁场的线圈）。螺线管有一个特性：通电时，线圈内部产生强磁场，而外部磁场则非常弱，理想情况下，无限长的螺线管外部磁场为零。在理论实验中，电子束分别从螺线管两侧经过，然后被引导汇合，形成**干涉图样**（Interference Pattern: 由波的叠加产生的明暗条纹）。干涉图样取决于两束电子波的相位。

当螺线管关闭时，电子穿过的区域既没有磁场也没有磁势，两束电子的相位变化相同，产生一个基线干涉图样。然而，当螺线管通电时，情况发生了变化。由于磁场完全局限于线圈内部，电子穿过的外部区域仍然没有磁场，但却存在**磁势**。这听起来很奇怪，但关键在于磁场是磁势的旋度。在某些区域，即使磁势本身不为零，其旋度（即磁场）也可以为零。在螺线管外部，磁矢量势的方向与电子束的运动方向不同：上方的电子束路径中，磁势方向与电子束方向相反，导致相位变化加快；下方的电子束路径中，磁势方向与电子束方向相同，导致相位变化减慢。如果相位确实仅取决于势而非场，那么两束电子的相位演化应该不同，从而导致干涉图样发生偏移。这表明，即使磁场为零，磁矢量势的存在也能产生可观测的效应，这在传统物理学中是不可思议的。

**阿哈罗诺夫**和**玻姆**于1959年发表了他们的发现，但反响不一。量子力学创始人之一**尼尔斯·玻尔**（Niels Bohr: 丹麦物理学家，量子力学哥本哈根解释的创始人）都无法接受粒子在没有力的情况下受势的影响。但也有物理学家支持他们，例如**理查德·费曼**（Richard Feynman: 美国理论物理学家，量子电动力学创始人之一），他写道：“矢量势出现在量子力学的波方程中是显而易见的，回想起来，直到1959年玻姆和阿哈罗诺夫首次提出并使整个问题变得清晰之前，没有人想到讨论这个实验，这似乎很奇怪。”费曼甚至将自己也包括在内，他后来疑惑为何自己从未注意到这种效应。物理学家**维克多·魏斯科普夫**（Victor Weisskopf: 奥地利裔美国理论物理学家，在量子电动力学和核物理方面有贡献）也有类似的反应：“对这项工作的第一个反应是它是错的。第二个反应是它是显而易见的。”最终，解决争议的唯一方法是进行实验验证。

But that's where you run into a problem because there's no way to directly measure the phase of a particle's wave function. So how do you devise an experiment that can yield a measurable result? Well, Aharonov enlisted the help of his mentor Bohm, and together they came up with the following theoretical experiment. It starts with a beam of electrons, which is split into two. In the middle of these two beams is a tightly coiled wire known as a solenoid. Now, solenoids have an interesting property. When you run a current through one, it produces a strong magnetic field inside the coil and a very weak field outside the coil. The longer the solenoid, the weaker the field in the surrounding space. For simplicity, Aharonov and Bohm imagined a setup with an ideal, infinitely long solenoid. One where the magnetic field outside the coil is exactly zero. After traveling on opposite sides of the solenoid, the electron beams are redirected back towards each other by the researchers, and here at this point, they intersect. Now since electrons behave as waves, though waves from the intersecting beams overlap and produce an interference pattern, bright fringes with gaps in between them. The exact pattern depends on the phase of each of these waves. When the solenoid is off, there is no magnetic field in the region, the electrons are traveling through and there is no magnetic potential. The phase of the electrons changes in the same way across both beams, regardless of whether they pass above or below the solenoid. And so you get an interference pattern that looks like this, but when the solenoid is turned on, well, there is still no magnetic field because it's confined entirely within the coil, but there is a magnetic potential. That may sound strange, but remember, the magnetic field is the curl of the magnetic potential. The curl of the potential can be zero in some region, even when the potential itself is not. And that's exactly what's happening here. Now take a closer look at the vector potential, in the space the upper beam passes through, the potential points in the opposite direction as the beam. So here the phase changes faster, but below the solenoid it points in the same direction as the beam. So the phase changes slower. If the phase truly depends on the potential alone and not the field, then the phases of the two beams should evolve differently. So as a result, the interference pattern should shift when the solenoid is on versus when it's off. The magnetic field could be just zero, and yet the presence, some vector potential could actually lead to observable effects that wasn't supposed to happen, right?

What I love about this story is that it reminds me that individual people can challenge entire paradigms. For nearly 200 years, many of the smartest minds in history all believed that potentials were nothing more than mathematical tools. But then two outsider physicists came along and defied that interpretation, confident in their approach they took on the entire scientific establishment. That same belief in the power of the individual is what motivated me to partner with planet wild. Many of us can feel helpless when we look at the huge problems facing the earth today, deforestation, plastic pollution, and the extinction of entire species. The easy solution is just to wait around and hope someone else will do something about it. Planet wild gets boots on the ground to actually protect our planet, and they make it easy for anyone to join the cause, which is one of the reasons I became a member. Another reason is that every month we as a community fund new projects to clean up oceans, rewild, forests, protect endangered species and raise awareness. You can think of planet wild as crowdfunding for nature. My favorite part, I get to see the impact of my contributions through outstanding monthly videos, which are published right here on YouTube. Take this for instance. This is a planet wild mission in Mumbai. It's a scalable technology that stops plastic at the source, preventing 10 tons from reaching the ocean every month. Planet wild invested over a hundred thousand dollars in this, and that money didn't come from governments or corporations, it came from ordinary people like you and me. You can sign up for whatever amount feels right for you and cancel any time. The first 150 people to sign up using my code Veritasium one will get their first month paid for by me. Just scan this QR code or click the link in the description. If you're interested in the science behind their projects, then go check out their YouTube channel. I'm leaving the link to the plastic cleanup mission in the description and now back to the mystery of the potential. Aharonov and Bohm published their findings in 1959, and the reception was mixed. Even Niels Bohr, one of the founding fathers of quantum mechanics, found it impossible to accept that a particle could be influenced by a potential in the absence of any force. But some physicists supported Aharonov and Bohm Richard Feynman wrote "the fact that the vector potential appears in the wave equation of quantum mechanics was obvious from the day it was written. It seems strange in retrospect that no one thought of discussing this experiment until 1959 when Bohm and Aharonov first suggested it and made the whole question crystal clear." Feynman included himself that statement. He later wondered why he had never noticed the effect. Physicist Victor Weisskopf had a similar response. "The first reaction to this work is that it's wrong. The second is that it's obvious." Ultimately, there was only one way to settle the debate. Someone had to actually do the experiment.

### 决定性实验与效应的哲学解读

**阿哈罗诺夫**和**玻姆**在**布里斯托大学**的同事**罗伯特·钱伯斯**（Robert Chambers: 英国物理学家，进行了阿哈罗诺夫-玻姆效应的早期实验）率先尝试进行实验。钱伯斯的实验基本遵循了理论设想，但由于理想螺线管不可能无限长，他改用了一根微小的针状铁须，其磁场在金属内部很强，但在外部可忽略不计，同时在周围空间产生了磁势。钱伯斯首先在空区域发射电子束获得基线干涉图样，然后引入磁性铁须并再次发射电子束，结果干涉图样发生了偏移。这似乎证明了阿哈罗诺夫和玻姆的正确性，但批评者仍不买账，认为可能是杂散磁场而非势导致了效应。在随后的几十年里，实验物理学家反复测试**阿哈罗诺夫-玻姆效应**（Aharonov-Bohm Effect: 量子力学中，带电粒子在无电磁场的区域仍受电磁势影响的现象），但每次实验都存在缺陷，使得结果仍有争议。

直到1986年，由**外村彰**（Akira Tonomura: 日本物理学家，通过高精度实验证实了阿哈罗诺夫-玻姆效应）领导的日本研究团队提出了一种新的实验方法。他们使用一个微小的甜甜圈形磁体，形成一个完美的环形磁场，所有磁场都局限于环内，外部磁场绝对为零。为了提供额外的保护，团队还在整个磁体上涂覆了一层**超导铌**（Superconducting Niobium: 一种在低温下具有零电阻的金属，可屏蔽磁场），以阻挡任何泄漏的磁场。与以往开关磁场的方法不同，外村团队的磁体始终处于开启状态，但由于其独特的形状，环体外部的势与中心区域的势不同。他们发射一束足够宽的电子束，使其一部分穿过空旷区域作为对照，另一部分则掠过整个环体，部分电子束绕过环体，部分穿过环体。最后，通过**双棱镜**（Biprism: 一种光学元件，用于将光束分成两束并使其干涉）使电子束汇合，产生干涉图样。

如果阿哈罗诺夫-玻姆效应不真实，那么环体外部和中心的干涉图样应该匹配。但如果效应真实存在，那么穿过中心的电子会经历不同的势，导致其干涉图样发生半个相位的偏移。外村团队的实验结果清晰地显示了这种偏移：环体外部的波峰与内部的波谷对齐，这与他们的预测完全一致。这最终证明了阿哈罗诺夫-玻姆效应是真实存在的。然而，新的争议随之而来：如何解释这一效应？它究竟揭示了宇宙的何种本质？

如今，物理学家主要分为两大阵营：
1.  **势是物理实在论**：第一种观点认为，势不仅仅是数学上的便利工具，它们能够直接影响物理实在。这是阿哈罗诺夫和玻姆最初支持的观点，他们在论文摘要中写道：“与经典力学的结论相反，即使在所有场都消失的区域，势对带电粒子也存在影响。”一些人甚至更进一步，认为由于势出现在薛定谔方程中而场没有，因此势比场更基本。**理查德·费曼**也支持这一观点，他曾写道：“A（磁矢量势）和B（磁场）一样真实——甚至更真实，无论那意味着什么。”尽管势的任意性（可以加上任意常数而不改变场）曾困扰许多人，但通过**线积分**（Line Integral: 沿曲线对函数进行积分，常用于计算功或势差）的计算表明，这种任意性在可观测的相位差中完美抵消，因此势的物理实在性得以保留。
2.  **场的非局域作用论**：第二种观点则认为，势仍然只是数学对象，而场才是效应的真正原因。但为了解释外村实验中磁场完全局限于螺线管内部的情况，这一观点的支持者被迫断言场可以**非局域地**（Non-locally: 在没有直接物理接触或场存在的情况下，远距离影响事物）作用。这意味着场可以在其自身不存在的空间区域之外影响事物。许多物理学家发现这种非局域性难以接受，因为它违背了场论的根本原则——局部原因只产生局部效应。

有趣的是，阿哈罗诺夫本人的观点后来从第一种转向了第二种。尽管非局域性仍然是一个有争议的观点，但相当一部分物理学家支持阿哈罗诺夫的最新立场，这场辩论至今仍在继续。此外，还有第三种解释，即粒子同时探索所有可能的路径，通过**量子隧穿**（Quantum Tunneling: 量子粒子穿过经典上无法逾越的势垒的现象）效应，波函数可能短暂进入有场的区域，从而受到影响。这种基于**路径积分**（Path Integral: 量子力学中一种计算粒子传播振幅的方法，考虑所有可能的路径）的解释被认为是完全合理的。

The first to try was a colleague of Aharonov and Bohms at the University of Bristol, Robert Chambers. Chambers' experiment largely followed the setup. Aharonov and Bohm proposed with one notable exception, an ideal solenoid would have to be infinitely long, which is physically impossible. So instead, chambers used a tiny needle-like piece of iron, about a millionth of a meter thick, and 500 times as long. When this iron whisker was magnetized, it produced a magnetic field that was strong within the metal itself, but negligible outside of it, as well as a magnetic potential in the surrounding region of space. To get a baseline interference pattern, Chambers fired two beams of electrons around an empty region of space. Then he added the magnetic whisker. When he fired the beams, again, the interference pattern shifted. It seemed that Aharonov and Bohm were right, but critics were unconvinced Maybe a stray field was responsible for the effect, not the potential, And that's showing throwing no shade on their colleague who did these cool experiments. It's like it's hard, right? It's really hard. And so it went for several decades, experimentalists repeatedly tested the Aharonov-Bohm effect, but each trial had flaws that left the result open to debate.

Until in 1986, a team of Japanese researchers led by Akira Tonomura came up with a new way to do the experiment. See, they used a tiny donut shaped magnet to make their magnetic field with a perfect Taurus. All the magnetic field is contained within the loop. Outside it, it's absolutely zero. And as an added layer of protection, the team also coded the entire magnet in a layer of superconducting niobium, which would block out any leaking fields. Now, previous experiments relied on turning a magnetic field on or off, but Tonomura's team took on a different approach. In their case, the magnet is always on, but because of its unique shape, the potential outside the torus is different from the one in the center. It points towards us on the outside and away from us on the inside. And the team realized they could take advantage of this. They started by firing off an electron beam, which was actually wide enough to be treated as two separate beams. Part of it traveled along through empty space and functioned as the control, whereas the other part washed over the entire torus. And what's important here is that the beam is wide enough so that part of it passes around the torus and part of it passes through. Then at the end, a biprism deflects the electron beams toward each other. They intersect, and this is where they create an interference pattern. Now, think about what this interference pattern should look like. Well, for starters, there should be a shadow of the torus, so we can fill that in. But the rest, well, it depends on whether the Aharonov-Bohm effect is real or not. If it's not real, we'd expect to see an interference pattern that looks something like this, where the pattern outside the torus and in the center match up. But if it is real, then the electrons that traveled through the center would've experienced a different potential, which would've shifted their pattern by half a phase. So that should look something like this. Now here are the results from Tonomura's experiment. You see these are the interference fringes inside and outside the magnet. And then if you follow what is a peak outside the torus lines up with, Right? A trough inside the middle, and then it's a peak outside again. And that's exactly what they predicted. This is exactly what they predicted. So it's real. It's real.

And yet soon a new debate emerged. The effect is real. Sure, but how should we interpret it? What is it really telling us about the nature of the universe? Today Physicists largely fall into one of two camps. The first camp claims that potentials aren't just mathematical conveniences. They can influence physical reality. This is the perspective initially favored by Aharonov and Bohm, as they wrote in the abstract of their paper. Contrary to the conclusions of classical mechanics, there exist effects of potentials on charged particles even in the region where all fields vanish. Some take this position a step further, since the potentials show up in the Schrodinger equation and the fields do not. Well, they argue that the potentials are more fundamental to physics than fields are. Richard Feynman supported this idea. He wrote A is as real as B - realer, whatever that means. I mean, I kind of like that interpretation, but something about the potential bothers me. And that's the fact that you can set the potential at any arbitrary height. It can be plus infinity. It can be minus infinity, anything in between. So wouldn't that change? You know how the potential actually influences the way function? This bothered me too, so much so that I actually ended up asking a professor about this, but it turns out it can't. It's not just the potential that's that's entering the observable, it's the line integral. So it's only A that enters. It's not the magnetic field B vanishes. It's only A, but it's not A alone. It gets a little technical here, but you know, if I pull up, you know, As one does - As one does a flip chart, now we can actually run this. So if you look at how the potential shows up, then what's measurable is not the phase directly, but it's the phase shift. Call it delta theta. Then the phase shift is line integral of A over the path or dotted with the path. So you get this. Now you can imagine, okay, let's add a constant to this. And if our setup is roughly, you know, we start here, one electron beam goes like this, and the other one goes like this, and these are symmetric, then the potential here will point, let's say in this direction. But here it will point in that direction. Let's say instead of A, we do A plus C, some constant. Then when we're taking the path this way, we'll be adding that C and we'll be dotting it with dx. But because that path is the exact same when we go this way, we just subtract it. So it cancels out. So the potential, yeah, it does show up, but in such a way that all the arbitrariness of the potential, it cancels out perfectly. Okay? It's a geometrical quantity solving a that has taken care of for which all that residual ambiguity has has literally canceled out. The potentials, being physical might sound strange, but the second interpretation is even stranger physicists in camp two maintain that potentials really are just mathematical objects and the fields are responsible for the effect. But in Tonomura's experiment, the magnetic field was completely confined within the solenoid, for this interpretation to be true, its supporters are forced to assert that fields can act non-locally. That is a field can influence things outside the region of space where the field itself exists. Many physicists find this idea difficult to swallow. I think the idea of saying that these fields act non-locally undoes the reason why we have field theory, right? The great try of a field theory, which has served us so well for more than 100 years, is this notion, stubborn notion that local causes yield only local effects. And yet Aharonov's own perspective has shifted from camp one to camp two. While non-locality remains a controversial idea, a sizable portion of physicists do side with Aharonov, and the debate continues to this day, I maybe have a third interpretation. Good. And I would love to get your thoughts, and if it's bad, please tell me honestly. Okay So we did this other video about particles essentially exploring all possible paths all at once. And so right now we're saying either the potentials are real or fields are acting non-locally. But what if there's a third option where the fields are still local and it is the fields that are affecting the change, but rather it's the particles that are exploring all possible paths all at once. You could potentially even have some quantum tunneling effects going inside an area where there are fields, you know, as the electron or the wave function at least explores all possible paths, gets influenced by those slight bits where the wave function is inside the field. I actually don't think that's ridiculous, Casper. That's how, that's for a strong ringing endorsement. I think there's a lot to that. Okay, If we could think about these things as it is indeed the quantum phase that's being affected, Yeah We can describe that phase in terms of quantum mechanical path integrals. I think that's a perfectly reasonable way to to frame it. So yeah, I'd buy that. That's awesome. I'm pretty sure this isn't the complete answer, but one thing which would be cool is if someone else takes this idea, you know, or maybe it gets inspired by it and they're like, actually that doesn't work, but here is how it does work and now we're closer. That's right. That would be the best possible outcome. Well, the best possible outcome is, is you're just right. But the second best possible outcome is that, is that that nudges the community more broadly to ask those to ask new questions of familiar material. That's right.

### 引力阿哈罗诺夫-玻姆效应与物理学范式重塑

科学界的一个新问题是：是否存在**引力版阿哈罗诺夫-玻姆效应**（Gravitational Aharonov-Bohm Effect: 粒子波函数在无引力场区域受引力势影响的现象）？2022年，**斯坦福大学**（Stanford University: 位于美国加利福尼亚州斯坦福的私立研究型大学）的研究人员对此进行了测试。他们将超冷**铷原子**（Rubidium Atoms: 一种碱金属原子，常用于量子实验）射入管状真空室，顶部放置一块钨块。原子与电子一样，也受波函数支配。研究人员将每个铷原子的波函数分成两个不同的波包，并将其发射到不同的高度：一个非常高，接近钨块，另一个则较低。当这两个波包在底部碰撞时，产生了干涉图样。在排除所有其他效应后，他们清晰地观察到了与阿哈罗诺夫和玻姆预测一致的**相位偏移**（Phase Shift: 波的相位发生改变）。

如果这些结果经得起严格审查，这将是一个巨大的发现，因为它表明**电磁势**（Electromagnetic Potential: 描述电磁场中单位电荷或电流所具有势能的标量或矢量场）和**引力势**（Gravitational Potential: 描述引力场中单位质量物体所具有势能的标量场）可以在最基本的层面上影响现实，即使所有场都精确为零。这是否意味着大多数物理教科书是错误的，或者需要更新？答案并非全盘否定。教科书是美丽的，我们从中学习到很多，但这并不意味着科学探索已经结束。我们应该对新的发现保持开放态度。正如拉格朗日时代到阿哈罗诺夫-玻姆效应之间近200年的变化所示，物理学范式仍可能以美丽、令人惊讶且极具影响力的方式发生转变。阿哈罗诺夫本人也曾表示，他之所以研究阿哈罗诺夫-玻姆效应，正是因为他并不认为势仅仅是数学工具，这与大多数科学家的看法不同。

One new question the community asked was, is there also a gravitational version? In 2022, researchers at Stanford tested this. A simplified version of their experiment works something like this. They shut up ultra cold rubidium atoms into a tube shaped vacuum chamber at the top of which was a tungsten mass. Now, atoms like electrons are also governed by a wave function. So they split each rubidium atoms wave function into two distinct packets, and they launched them to different heights. One was sent really high and got close to the mass whereas the other didn't. And then when the two collided at the bottom, this created an interference pattern. And when they let this interfere and accounted for all other effects, they could clearly see the phase shift as predicted by Aharonov and Bohm So it seems like the gravitational Aharonov and Bohm effect is real. If the results hold up the scrutiny, this is a huge finding because it suggests that the electromagnetic and gravitational potentials can influence reality at the most fundamental scale, even when all the fields are exactly zero. So does that mean that most physics textbooks are wrong or need updating? Don't throw out all the textbooks. They're beautiful. We learn a lot, but that doesn't mean we're done and we should be open to surprise. And just because things haven't changed in let's say 200 years roughly between say Lagrange and Aharonov-Bohm, they still could change, right? And they can sometimes change in in beautiful and surprising and very powerful ways. I read somewhere that the reason you decided to do the AB effect was that you didn't really think potentials were something that was just a mathematical tool like most scientists believe.
