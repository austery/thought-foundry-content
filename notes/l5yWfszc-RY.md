### GLP-1药物的潜力

**主持人**: 让我们来谈谈关于GLP-1的新研究，以及像奥泽匹克和威格维这样的药物，它们表明可能能够治疗成瘾，甚至抑郁症。一项涉及阿片类药物使用障碍患者的研究发现，GLP-1药物在3周内将渴望减少了40%。另一项研究调查了超过一百万患有酒精使用障碍或阿片类药物使用障碍的人的健康记录。它发现服用GLP-1药物的人，酒精中毒的发生率降低了50%，阿片类药物过量的发生率降低了40%。我与斯坦福大学的Anna Lemi博士进行了交谈，以了解更多信息。

**Host**: Let's talk about new research on GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy that suggests they may be able to treat addiction and possibly depression. One study involving patients with opioid use disorder found that GLP-1 medication reduced cravings by 40% over the course of 3 weeks. Another looked at the health records of more than a million people with alcohol use disorder or opioid use disorder. It found people taking GLP-1s had a 50% lower rate of alcohol intoxication and a 40% lower rate of opioid overdose. I sat down with Dr. Anna Lemi, professor and medical director of addiction medicine at Stanford University to learn more.

**主持人**: Lemi博士，非常感谢您加入我们今天的Rundown节目。您今天怎么样？

**Host**: Dr. Lemi, thank you so much for joining us on the rundown. How are you doing today?

</details>

**Dr. Lemi**: 我很好。感谢您的邀请。

**Dr. Lemi**: I'm doing well. Thanks for having me.

**主持人**: 当然。嗯，正如我们所说，当我们关注GLP1和成瘾时，早期迹象确实很好。您如何评价GLP1s在治疗成瘾方面的潜力，以及奥泽匹克？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Of course. Um as we noted some really good signs early signs uh when we look at GLP1s and sort of addiction. How would you characterize the promise uh with GLP1s and say Ozempic uh when it comes to treating addiction?

</details>

**Dr. Lemi**: 首先，我认为值得注意的是，我们已经达到了人类历史上的一个阶段，我们实际上需要一种药物来帮助我们减少食量。在人类历史的大部分时间里，我们花一天的 대부분 시간을 충분한 음식을 찾는데 썼습니다. 现在，我们正在努力抵制食物。因此，像GLP1s这样的分子，是适应一个富足环境的一种方式。所以，我认为这本身就很有意思。GLP1s的潜力是巨大的。我们现在看到的信号，在帮助人们抑制食欲、减轻体重、规范血糖方面，真的非常令人兴奋。以及它在更广泛的治疗成瘾方面的潜力，包括酒精成瘾、阿片类药物成瘾、尼古丁成瘾。这真是一个令人兴奋的时刻，拥有了一个新的工具，在目前工具相对有限的情况下。帮助我们理解这里的科学原理。它实际上是如何起作用的？

**Dr. Lemi**: Well, first of all, I think it's worth noting that we reached a point in human history when we actually need a medication to help us eat less. For most of human existence, we have spent the majority of our day looking for enough food. Now, we're struggling to resist food. And as a result, uh, molecules like GLP1s are a way to adapt to a an environment of abundance. And so, I think that in itself is fascinating. Um, the promise of GLP1s is enormous. uh the signal that we're seeing now in terms of helping people curb appetite, lose weight, uh normalize blood sugar is is just really really exciting. Um as well as its potential promise in treating addiction more broadly, alcohol addiction, opioid addiction, nicotine addiction. It's it's just really an exciting moment to have a new new tool in what is um a pretty limited toolbox at this point. help us understand the science here. How does it actually work?

</details>

**Dr. Lemi**: GLP1s模拟我们身体在进食后释放到肠道中的一种分子，它向身体发出信号，好的，你已经吃饱了，可以停止进食了。同时，它还会导致胰岛素和其他降低血糖的激素的释放，并进一步促成饱腹感。因此，它们基本上增强或放大我们身体已经做的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lemi**: So, the GLP1s mimic a molecule that we make in our bodies that's released in the gut after we eat that signals to the body, okay, you've had enough food, you can stop eating. As well as leading to the release of insulin and other hormones which lower blood sugars and again contribute to that feeling of fullness. So they essentially augment or amplify something that our body does already.

**主持人**: 当我们谈到它的潜力及其有效性时，它们是否可能对某些类型的成瘾更有效？我们是在酒精方面看到效果吗？我们是在阿片类药物方面看到效果吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Are there any when we talk about the potential and its effectiveness, are they potentially more effective with certain types of addictions? Is there are we seeing it with alcohol? Are we seeing it with opioids?

</details>

**Dr. Lemi**: 好吧，请记住，它们最初是为了治疗2型糖尿病和相关肥胖症而开发的。嗯，而且，这有点出乎意料，或者说是一种次要的认识，哦，哇，它们帮助减少食物摄入的能力，可能也会帮助其他成瘾。因此，迄今为止，最强的早期信号来自酒精，这并不令人惊讶，因为酒精也是一种碳水化合物，对吧？这与卡路里有关。这并不是一个巨大的惊喜，虽然你知道，一个受欢迎的早期信号。令人惊讶的是GLP1s的其他潜在影响，例如它对阿片类药物成瘾、尼古丁成瘾，甚至我们所谓的行为成瘾的潜在影响。这些是我们做的事情，比如赌博成瘾或性成瘾。嗯，人们现在正在研究GLP1s在该领域的可能性。

<details>

**Dr. Lemi**: Well, remember they really originated to treat type 2 diabetes and related obesity. Um, and it's really kind of a serendipitous or secondary uh awareness that oh wow this their ability to help with uh decreasing food intake might actually help with other addictions as well. So the strongest early signal has been with alcohol, not surprisingly because alcohol is also a carbohydrate, right? And so that's calorie mediated. That wasn't really the hugest surprise, although you know, a welcome early signal. What has been surprising is some of the other potential effects of the GLP1s like its potential effect on an opioid addiction, a nicotine addiction, or even what we call behavioral addictions. These are like things that we do like, you know, a gambling addiction or a sex addiction. Uh, in that people are now looking at the possibility of GLP1s in that arena as well.
