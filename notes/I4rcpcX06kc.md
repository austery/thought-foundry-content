### AI数据中心热潮

**Natalie Kitroeff**: 大家好，我是《纽约时报》的**Natalie Kitroeff**，这里是《The Daily》。科技公司正竞相建造数千个大型数据中心，以推动**AI**革命。为了寻找所需的土地，它们正涌入美国各地的乡村社区。它们的宣传是，数据中心将带来好工作、收入，并在快速变化的经济中占据一席之地。但并非所有人都买账。今天，我的同事**Karen Wise**将讲述一个县抵制大型科技公司的故事，以及当**AI**降临小镇时会发生什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: From the New York Times, I'm Natalie Kitroeff. This is the Daily. Tech companies are racing to build thousands of massive data centers to power the AI revolution. And to find the land they need, they're barreling into rural communities across America. Their pitch is that data centers will bring good jobs, revenue, and a foothold in a rapidly changing economy. But not everyone's buying it. Today, my colleague Karen Wise tells the story of one county pushing back against big tech and what happens when AI comes to town.

</details>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: **Karen**，今天是2月16日星期一，很高兴你再次来到节目。我也很高兴能和你在一起。我们请你来是因为你报道美国一些最大的科技公司，最近这意味着报道**人工智能**。具体来说，你一直关注的是推动**AI**革命的基础设施，所有这些公司都参与其中，那就是数据中心。你一直在报道社区对这些数据中心的回应方式，这种回应充满了矛盾且往往很复杂，这就是我们今天想谈论的话题。但在我们深入之前，请你帮我们理解一下这场数据中心热潮。它到底是什么样子的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: It's Monday, February 16th, Karen. I'm so happy to have you back on the show. So happy to be here with you. Okay, we've come to you because you cover some of the biggest tech companies in America. And what that's meant recently is covering artificial intelligence. And specifically, what you've been focusing on is the infrastructure that drives the AI revolution, which they're all involved in, and that's data centers. You've been reporting on the conflicted and often complicated way that communities are responding to these data centers, and that's what we want to talk about today. But before we get there, just help us understand this data center boom. What does it actually look like?

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 是的，没错。我的意思是，当**ChatGPT**刚推出时，最初很多报道都集中在聊天机器人上，但很快，每当公司发布季度财报时，一个主要的主题就开始浮现。你开始看到越来越多的资金被用于在全国乃至全球各地建设数据中心。现在发生的情况是，数据中心变得越来越大，数量也越来越多。所以，这种规模真的很难让人理解。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: Yes, exactly. I mean, when ChatGPT first came out, initially a lot of the reporting was about chat bots, but very quickly this major theme started emerging every quarter when the companies would report their earnings. And what you started seeing is more and more money being spent building data centers all around the country and the globe. And what's happening is the data centers are getting bigger and there's more of them. And so the scale is just really hard to wrap your head around.

</details>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: 你说的“规模”是什么意思？我们这里谈论的是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: What do you mean by that? What are we talking about here?

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 去年，仅仅**Amazon**、**Google**、**Meta**和**Microsoft**这四家公司就在资本支出上花费了**4000亿美元**，其中大部分是数据中心。更具体地说，**4000亿美元**是一个巨大的数字。我的意思是，我们谈论的是国家GDP级别的资金。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: Well, in the last year, just four companies, Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft spent $400 billion on capital expenditures. And most of that is data centers. And just to put a fine point on it, like $400 billion is giant. I mean, like we're talking GDP of countries level money.

</details>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: 是的，没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: Yes. Exactly.

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 它实际上已经成为全国各地一股强大的经济力量。你看到人们在全国各地流动，建设这些项目。几乎你能想象到的每个行业都被卷入其中。有投机者、开发商、公用事业公司、能源生产商，他们联合起来在许多地方推动这些项目，因为目前对这些建筑物中存储的计算能力有巨大的需求。我们正处于这样一个时刻，尽管所有这些建设都在加速进行，但实际上可用的数据中心仍然不足以满足人们的需求。所以这些公司正在争分夺秒地尽快建成它们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: And it's actually become this powerful economic force across the country. You have people moving all over the country to build these projects. You have kind of almost every industry you can imagine is getting pulled into this. You have speculators, you have developers, utilities, energy generators that come in together and push these projects in so many places because there is such a big demand for the computing power that lives in these buildings right now. And we're at this moment where despite all of this building and all the speed, there's actually not enough data centers available for the demand that people have. So the companies are racing to get them up as quickly as they can.

</details>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: 那么，告诉我这种需求。为什么有这么多钱投入到数据中心？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: So tell me about that demand. Why is there so much money going into data centers?

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 这是为了**人工智能**，既是为了训练**人工智能**——这些是支撑我们使用的技术的系统和模型，比如当你向**ChatGPT**提问时，或者你公司幕后有一个系统在执行以前需要手动完成的流程——也是为了使用**人工智能**，因为它们实现想法的方式是同时运行大量计算。所以你需要更大的数据中心、更强大的芯片、更多的电力来冷却这些芯片。最大的**AI**数据中心可能消耗的电力相当于一百万个美国家庭的用电量。在数据中心领域，人们谈论的不是建筑物的占地面积，就像你可能考虑商业建筑那样。他们谈论的是电力需求，因为电力需求是最重要的，它真正象征着一个项目的真实规模。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: So it's for artificial intelligence and this is both to train artificial intelligence. These are the systems and models that underpin the technology that we use when you ask ChatGPT something or there's a system behind the scenes at your company doing some process that someone used to do manually. And some of it is to use artificial intelligence because the way they power their ideas is by running a lot of calculations at once. And so you need bigger data centers, more powerful chips, much more power to cool those chips. And the largest AI data centers could use as much power as a million American homes. In the data center world, what people talk about is not the square footage of a building like you might think about for a commercial building. They talk about the power demands because the power demands is what is most important and really symbolizes the true size of a project.

</details>

### 社区的抵制与地方自治

**Natalie Kitroeff**: 这种电力需求肯定需要大量的资源。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: And that power demand requires a lot of resources I have to assume.

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 是的。所以这里发生了很多不同的事情。你需要大量的建筑物来容纳数据中心本身。你需要电线和变电站来向它们输送电力。我们还看到新一代电力生产的蓬勃发展，因为这个国家的用电量在很长一段时间内相对持平，而现在我们看到需求大幅增长，这主要是因为数据中心。所以现在科技公司正在全国各地寻找建造地点。它们想要大片土地，有可用的电力，有良好的输电线路，良好的连接性，最好还有一个欢迎它们的社区。现在，全国各地的社区都在努力弄清楚，这是否是他们想要的？如果是，他们想从中得到什么？他们是否有能力支持它或阻止它？这真的导致了许多地方自下而上的抗议浪潮。实际上很难追踪有多少地方正在进行这些辩论，在县委员会会议室和公用事业委员会等各种古怪的小型市政空间里，因为它引发了所有这些关于我们希望我们宝贵的资源、空间、电力、水被用于何处的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: Yes. So you have a bunch of different things happening here. You need a lot of buildings for the data centers themselves. You need the power lines and the substations to transmit the power to them. And we're also seeing this kind of boom in new generation of power because electricity use was relatively flat for quite a long time in this country and now we're seeing this big growth in demand primarily because of data centers. So now the tech companies are scouring the country for places to build. They want big lots of land with available power with good transmission lines, good connectivity, and ideally a community that wants them. And now we have communities all over the place trying to figure out is this what they want? If so, what do they want to get out of it? And do they have power to support it or stop it? And it's it's really led to this kind of groundup swell in so many places. It's hard to actually keep track of the number of places that are now having these debates in all these kind of wonky small municipal spaces in like county commission rooms and in utility commissions because it drags up all of these questions about what do we want our valuable resources, our space, our power, our water. What do we want it to be used for?

</details>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: 好的，我想深入探讨这些争论。我想了解它们是如何在非常细致的层面上运作的。你访问过许多这样的地点，我想知道你是否会选择一个能帮助我们了解实际情况、如何演变的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: Okay, I want to dig in on these fights. I want to understand like how they work at a really granular level. You have visited many of these sites and I wonder if there's one that you would pick that would help us kind of get inside what this actually looks like, how it plays out.

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 是的，我会选择**印第安纳州圣约瑟夫县**。几年前，那里基本上没有数据中心。然后，在过去两年左右的时间里，你看到数百亿美元的资金涌入那里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: Yeah, I would look at St. Joseph County, Indiana, and it had no data centers a couple years ago essentially. And then in the past two or so years, you've seen tens of billions of dollars flow in there.

</details>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: 哇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: Wow.

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 一个社区从最初反应平平，到后来出现一股压倒性的反对这些项目的浪潮。所以我真的认为它展示了我们正在全国各地反复看到的这些动态。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: And a community that went from not much response to kind of an overwhelming tide shifting against these projects. And so I really think it shows some of these dynamics that we're seeing repeated all over the country.

</details>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: 好的。那里发生了什么？听起来这个开发项目进展得非常快。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: All right. What has happened there? It sounds like this development has happened really quickly.

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 是的。**圣约瑟夫县**位于该州的北部。**南本德**是最大的城市，但该县的其余部分主要是农业区，当地经济一直在寻找新的机会。它有点像美国中西部上游的城镇，那里曾经有很多工作，但后来都消失了。**Studebaker**公司曾设在那里，他们失去了所有那些汽车工作，对吧？该县长期以来一直致力于吸引工业客户。现在快进到2023年5月，公用事业公司带着**Amazon**找到了县经济发展办公室。这正是全国各地正在发生的事情：公用事业公司发现自己从事着一项业务，即将这些科技客户与他们在其辖区内了解到的、可用且非常适合此类项目的土地进行匹配。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: Yes. So St. Joseph County. It's in the northern part of the state. Southbend is the big city, but the rest of the county is primarily agricultural and the regional economy has been looking for new opportunities. It's kind of like the upper Midwest towns that saw a lot of work bottom out. Studebaker was based there and they lost all those automotive jobs, right? And the county has been working to attract industrial clients for a long time. Now flash forward to May 2023 and the utility comes to the county economic development office with Amazon and this is exactly what's happening around the country is the utilities found themselves in this business of matching the customers these tech companies with the lands they know of in their territory that are available and would be well suited for this type of project.

</details>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: 那么，他们认为**Amazon**以这种方式来到小镇会带来什么好处？请为我描绘一下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: And what do they see as the benefits of an Amazon coming to town in this way? Just sketch that out for me.

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 经济发展办公室认为这是一个很棒的项目。它规模巨大，至少**110亿美元**。从中，他们看到了税收来源。他们认为它能创造大量就业机会，尤其是在建设期间，也是利用他们的土地和资源，成为我们都听说过的未来经济的一部分，这种技术就是未来。结果发现，这是**Amazon**为一家领先的**AI**实验室**Anthropic**建造的旗舰**AI**数据中心。你可能听说过他们的聊天机器人**Claude**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: The Economic Development Office sees this as a great project. It is enormous. It's 11 billion at least. And from that, they see a source of tax revenue. They see it as a great jobs producer, particularly during construction and just a way of using their land and resources to be part of this future economy that we all hear about that this technology is the future. And it turns out that this was this flagship AI data center that Amazon was building for one of the leading AI labs called Anthropic. You may have heard of their chatbot called Claude.

</details>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: 他们正在建造这个数据中心，作为**Anthropic**的一个巨型计算机，用于训练其下一代模型，并最终能够用它来部署**AI**服务。所以对双方来说，这都成为一个非常有价值的机会。他们认为这是一个双赢的局面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: And they were building this data center to act as one giant computer for Anthropic to use to train its next generation of models and eventually to be able to use it to start deploying AI services as well. And so for both sides, this became a really kind of valuable opportunity. They see it as a win-win.

</details>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: 听起来对**Amazon**来说是个大项目。那么，社区此刻的感受如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: So huge project for Amazon, it sounds like. What is the community feeling at this point?

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 最初，没什么感觉。我的意思是，当地没有太大的争议。我相信县议会中只有两个人投了反对票，因为它当时并不是什么大事。人们对此知之甚少。所以他们就开始了，并且建造得非常快。我的意思是，在一年之内，他们就建起了大约十几座建筑物，很快每天就有数千名工人在现场工作。这既有好处也有坏处。有大量的资金流入。酒店住满了，酒店的住宿税也流回了县里。当地人获得了工作。学徒计划也发展壮大了。所有这些好处，但你也会面临很多缺点。那里交通确实非常糟糕。有关于事故的安全隐患。你知道，像这样的大项目会带来很多骚动。人们开始更多地关注电力和水的消耗。这些都是非常敏感的问题。与此同时，其他数据中心项目也开始在该县和更广泛的地区涌现。所以**Microsoft**在县的另一部分地区的一个地点签订了合同，然后当我们去那里时，不断有其他谣言四起。哦，我们听说这块地可能是**Meta**的项目。**Google**也在做些什么。新项目不断涌现，形成一种持续的增长态势，人们基本上对此感到不安，尤其是在他们亲身经历这一切的时候。然后去年又出现了一个新项目，甚至比**Amazon**的项目更大，可能达到**130亿美元**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: Initially, not much. I mean, there was not a huge debate locally. I believe only two people voted against it in the county council because it just wasn't a big deal. People didn't know much about it. And so they got going and they built very quickly. I mean within a year they had I believe it was like a dozen buildings up and very quickly you end up with thousands of workers on site every day and that is both a good and a bad. You have a lot of money flowing through that. The hotels are full and the occupancy tax for hotels is flowing back to the county. You have people locally getting jobs. The apprenticeships programs have grown. all of these benefits, but you also end up with a lot of downsides. There's legitimately terrible traffic around there. There's safety concerns about accidents. You know, there's just a lot of commotion that comes with a project this large. And people start wrapping their heads more around the power use and the water use. And those are very sensitive issues. And at the same time, other data center projects start popping up around the county and the region more broadly. And so Microsoft goes into contract on a site in another part of the county and then there's other rumors constantly swirling when we were there. Oh, we heard this parcel might be a Meta project. There's Google doing something. There's just this constant crescendo of new projects popping up and people are just unnerved by it basically, particularly as they're living through this. And then there comes this new project last year, even bigger than the Amazon project, potentially $13 billion.

</details>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: 哇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: Wow.

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 占地超过一千英亩。但这个项目有一个问题。他们需要改变分区才能建造这个大型数据中心。这意味着它需要提交给社区，提交给县议会决定，他们是否会批准这个项目？这意味着这些民选官员现在需要听取社区的意见，并决定他们是否想要更多的数据中心，或者他们已经受够了，是否要划清界限。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: Over a,000 acres. But with this one, there's a catch. They need a zoning change to be able to build this big data center. And that means that it needs to go before the community, before the county council to decide, will they approve this project or not? And that means these elected officials now need to listen to their community and decide, do they want more data centers or have they had enough and are they going to draw a line?

</details>

### 公开听证会：支持者与反对者

**Natalie Kitroeff**: **Karen**，你刚刚描述了**圣约瑟夫县**面临的重大选择：是批准这个新的数据中心，这个新的大型项目，还是说不。那么，结果如何？实际发生了什么？这个新项目，目前还不清楚是谁在背后推动。它是一家匿名的有限责任公司。世界上只有少数几家公司会使用如此多的计算能力，但没有人知道它是谁。这种匿名性确实加剧了人们对这个项目的焦虑。该项目需要县政府的分区批准才能继续。因此，数据中心的支持者开始发起自己的宣传活动，试图说：“是的，有些人不想要它，但有一种沉默的大多数人确实想要这个，并且想要我们急需的税收。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: Karen, you just set up this big choice facing St. Joseph County whether to greenlight this new data center, this new massive project or say no. So, how does that play out? What actually happens? So, this new project, it's not clear who's behind it. It's an anonymous LLC. There's only a handful of companies in the world that would use this much computing power, but no one knows who it is. And that anonymity really amplifies the anxiety over the project. And the project needs zoning approval from the county to continue. And so the supporters of the Dana Centers start mounting their own campaign trying to say, "Yes, some people don't want it, but there's kind of like a silent majority that really wants this and wants the tax dollars that we desperately need."

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 最终在12月举行了一场听证会，这基本上是对这次重新分区的最终决定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: And eventually there's a hearing in December that's kind of the final yay or nay on this resoning.

</details>

**发言人**: 各位女士先生，晚上好，欢迎大家。**圣约瑟夫县**议会2025年12月9日星期二的例行会议现在开始。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome. The regular meeting of the St. Joseph County Council for Tuesday, December the 9th, 2025 is now called to order. Please

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 这场听证会成为了所有支持和反对论点的集中体现。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: And it becomes kind of the capsule for all of this arguments for and against it.

</details>

**发言人**: 创世之神，我们深吸一口气。今晚我们祈求智慧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Creator God, we take a deep breath. We pray this evening for wisdom. We have

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 它在**南本德**，在主要的市政大楼里。那是一个没有窗户的房间，里面有很多座位。主大厅里至少有100人，此外侧大厅里也挤满了人，主房间里也挤满了人。这太惊人了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: And it's in Southbend. It's in the main municipal building. It's sort of a windowless room with a bunch of seats. There's at least 100 people in the main lobby in addition to the crowd that is out in the side lobby in addition to the crowd that's here in the main room. This is amazing.

</details>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: 现场完全爆满。他们让人们通过**Zoom**在线登录。他们的**Zoom**容量实际上都达到了上限。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: There is total overflow capacity. They have people signing on on Zoom. They actually max out their Zoom capacity watching.

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 挤满了人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: It's packed.

</details>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: 挤满了人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: It's packed. It's packed.

</details>

**发言人**: 各位，我本来想留到后面说，但现在就说吧。今晚我们保持秩序非常非常重要，因为我们要讨论一个非常情绪化的话题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Folks, I was saving this, but I'll say it now. It's going to be very very important that we keep decorum tonight because we have a very emotional topic we're going to be discussing

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 县议会一开始就恳求大家保持和平。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: And the county council starts out by really pleading for peace.

</details>

**发言人**: 我们将立即处理一些不实信息。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: We're going to address a number of misinformation items right off the bat.

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 首先是新项目的代表，他们站出来陈述他们的理由。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: First up are representatives for the new project and they come forth and try to make their case.

</details>

**发言人**: 这个项目不需要之前讨论的那么多水。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: As this project does not require the amount of water that has been previously discussed.

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 他们说他们已经解决了社区一直提出的水和能源问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: They say they've addressed the water and energy concerns that the community has been raising.

</details>

**发言人**: 根据基础设施和电力基础设施来看，你不可能找到比这个地点更完美的了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: You could not pick a a more perfect location based on infrastructure and electrical infrastructure than this site

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 并且项目应该获得批准。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: And that the project should be approved.

</details>

**发言人**: 说到这里，我暂时不说话了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: And with that, I will stop talking for a while.

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 然后，人们一直在等待的时刻到来了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: And then comes the moment that people have sort of been waiting for.

</details>

**发言人**: 我们将就第42-25号法案举行公开听证会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: We will open the public hearing on bill number 42-25,

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 这是公众作证环节，人们可以表达他们的担忧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: Which is the public testimony where people can voice their concerns.

</details>

**发言人**: 房间里有没有人想发言支持这项法案？请签名并报上您的姓名和地址以供记录。您有3分钟时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Is there anyone in the room who'd like to speak in favor of the bill? Please sign in and state your name and address for the record. You have 3 minutes.

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 他们向项目的支持者开放发言。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: And they open it up to supporters of the project.

</details>

**发言人**: **James Gardner**，国际操作工程师工会代表，也是州建筑行业的一部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: James Gardner, representative of the International Union of Operating Engineers and part of the state building trades.

</details>

**发言人**: 晚上好。我叫**Murray Mill**。我是劳工地方645的业务经理。**Jason Pianc**，IBW153的助理业务经理。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Good evening. My name is Murray Mill. I'm the business manager for the labors local 645. Uh Jason Pianc, assistant business manager with IBW153.

</details>

**发言人**: **Bob Buyers**，**印第安纳州南本德**钢铁工人地方292的业务经理。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Bob Buyers, business manager for Iron Workers Local 292 here in South Bend, Indiana.

</details>

**发言人**: 大家好，我叫**Nicholas Klein**。我是IU OE地方150的业务代表。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Hello, my name is Nicholas Klein. I'm a business representative with IU OE Local 150.

</details>

**发言人**: 我今天来是代表我们县所有行业工人，发言支持重新分区。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: I'm here to speak in favor of the resoning on behalf of trades workers all over our county.

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 所以，项目的大多数支持者要么是工会工人，要么是代表工会工人的人，他们说：

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: So, the majority of the supporters of the project are either union workers or people who represent union workers and they're saying

</details>

**发言人**: 这个工地帮助我通过稳定的工作和丰厚的福利来养活我的年轻家庭。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: The job site has helped me support my young family with steady work and great benefits.

</details>

**发言人**: 随着目前正在进行的项目，我们的学徒规模已经翻了一番多，如果这个项目获得重新分区并顺利进行，我们希望再次做到同样的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: With the projects that are going on currently, um we have over doubled the size of our apprenticeship and we look to do the same again if this gets reszoned and goes through.

</details>

**发言人**: 这对当地居民来说是一个巨大的福音。我19岁时被操作工程师地方150录用，没有学生贷款，收入丰厚。这只有通过像这些项目这样的经济发展才有可能实现。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: This has been a huge boon to the people that live locally. I was accepted to the operating engineers local 150 at 19 years old with no student debt, making great money. This is only possible through the economic developments like these projects.

</details>

**发言人**: 在**印第安纳州**开车转转。那些工厂倒闭或拒绝新开发项目的城镇变成了鬼城。不要认为这是理所当然的。县经济的改善是因为我们对新的发展机会说了“是”，而不是因为我们拒绝了它们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Take a drive around Indiana. Towns that have had a factory close or refuse new development projects become ghost towns. Don't take it for granted. The improved county economy happens because we have said yes to new development opportunities, not because we have turned them down.

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 然后还有另一批支持者，主要是商业领袖和倡导者，他们提出了更广泛的呼吁。他们基本上是在说，我们应该适应并成为这个未来的一部分。

**Karen Wise**: And then there's another group of supporters, primarily business leaders and advocates, who are making a broader appeal. They're basically saying we should adapt and be part of this future.

</details>

**发言人**: 这是关于明智规划，确保我们的土地利用与我们未来的需求相符，并为我们的社区提供在竞争激烈的经济中蓬勃发展的工具。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: It's about planning smartly, ensuring our land use aligns with our future needs and giving our community the tools to thrive in a competitive economy.

</details>

**发言人**: 这是一种技术上的必然。我们必须顺应潮流。我们必须接受它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: And this is a technological necessity. And we have to ride with that. We have to go with that.

</details>

**发言人**: 我们可以建造这个数据中心，我们都可以赢。谢谢大家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: We can do this data center and we can all win. Thank you.

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 所以，你看到县级的这些商业领袖在重复**硅谷**人士一直在说的话，即这是我们经济正在发生的一部分，我们只需要加入进来。与此同时，工会人士提出了一个非常具体的论点，说公司和我们地方官员对这些数据中心的承诺，实际上正在为我们带来回报。这对我们这些蓝领工人来说是一个巨大的好处。这些工作非常好，薪水很高。我的意思是，我曾和一些电工聊过，他们一年能挣**20万美元**。我的意思是，是的。是的，那是真金白银，如果人们不住在那里，他们也会搬到那里。酒店都住满了。有房车公园。我的意思是，人们正在感受到这一点，并融入到这个经济中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: So you have these business leaders at the county level kind of paring what the Silicon Valley folks have been saying that this is part of what's happening in our economy and we just need to get on board. And at the same time, you have the union folks making a very tangible argument saying that pitch that the company and our local officials made about the promise of these data centers, that's actually paying off for us. Like this is a huge benefit for those of us that are bluecollar workers. These jobs are very good. They pay a lot of money. I mean, I've talked to electricians that make $200,000 a year. I mean, it's Yes. Yes, it is real money and people are moving there if they don't live there already. The hotels are full. You have RV parks. I mean, people are feeling this and feeding into this economy.

</details>

**发言人**: 还有其他人在线上想发言支持这项法案吗？好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Is there anyone else online who would like to speak in favor of this bill? Okay.

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 但大约25分钟后，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: But after about 25 minutes,

</details>

**发言人**: 那我们就继续吧。房间里有没有人想发言反对这项法案？请签名。报上您的姓名和地址以供记录。您有三分钟时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: We'll move on then. Is there anyone in the room who would like to speak in opposition to this bill? Please sign in. State your name and address for the record. You have three minutes.

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 他们转向了反对者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: They turn to the opponents.

</details>

**发言人**: 我想说的是，68年前，一个家庭来到这里，是为了这里的宁静、安静和小镇的生活品质。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: What I want to say is a family 68 years ago came here for the peacefulness, the quiet, the small town quality of life.

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 从那时起，人们就开始了长达数小时的证词，讲述他们为什么不想要这个项目。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: And that's where you start hours upon hours of testimony of people talking about why they don't want this project.

</details>

**发言人**: 公众有权提前知道谁在争夺我们的土地和税收减免。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: The public has a right to know upfront who is vying for our land and tax abatements.

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 有些人谈论更多程序上的担忧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: Some people talk about more procedural concerns.

</details>

**发言人**: 我们的孩子值得拥有比混凝土和交通更多的东西。他们值得拥有一个可以自由奔跑、在安静的道路上骑自行车、仰望满天繁星的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Our children deserve more than concrete and traffic. They deserve a place where they can freely run, ride bikes down quiet roads, and gaze at a sky full of stars.

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 还有些人谈论生活质量问题，比如经历这种建设是怎样的感受。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: And other people talk about kind of quality of life issues of what it's like living through this construction.

</details>

**发言人**: 我在路边割草时，有汽车以高速从我身边反方向驶过。这不仅把我吓坏了，还把碎石溅得我全身都是，割草机也一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: I was mowing the grass beside the road when cars go in opposite direction at high speeds passed right beside me. Not only did it scare the hell out of me, it sprayed gravel all over me and all over the mower.

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 其他人谈论了环境问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: Other people talked about environmental concerns.

</details>

**发言人**: 数据中心是当地空气污染的重要来源，因为

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Data centers are significant contributors to local air pollution because

</details>

**发言人**: 是的，水井会干涸。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Yeah, wells are going to dry up.

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 主要是开放土地的流失。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: Primarily, it's the loss of the open lands

</details>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: 你还听到了对**人工智能**未来的担忧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: And you also heard concerns over the future of artificial intelligence.

</details>

**发言人**: 我已经做了研究，我知道技术正在发展，在未来几年，下一代数据中心将不需要那么多电力、水或空间。如果这些建筑物不再需要了，会发生什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: I have done my research and I know that technology is evolving and in the next few years, the next generation of data centers won't need as much electricity or water or space. What happens if these buildings aren't necessary anymore?

</details>

**发言人**: 当我们只剩下数百个巨大的空置货架时，我们该怎么办？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: What do we do when we are left with hundreds of big empty shelves?

</details>

**发言人**: 我们会被这些空置的建筑物困住吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Would we be stuck with all these empty buildings?

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 你也看到了更广泛的焦虑，即这是一个我们不确定是否想要的未来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: And you also just saw a broader anxiety that this is a future that we're not sure we want

</details>

**发言人**: 股票持续上涨，而就业率下降，这让所有者以牺牲工人阶级为代价变得更富有。这与**ChatGPT**的创建精确相关。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Where stocks continue to rise while employment falls allowing for the owners to get richer at the expense of the working class. This correlated precisely with the creation of chat GBD.

</details>

**发言人**: 我真的不认为人类灭绝即将到来，但那些比我们任何人都更了解这件事的人对此感到完全恐慌，这一事实确实应该让我们停下来思考。所以，担忧的范围从实际的、地方的、基层社区的问题，一直延伸到更宏大的图景：这一切到底是为了什么？我们为什么要争相支持它？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: I don't really think that human extinction is coming, but the fact that the people who know this way way better than any of us are totally freaked out about it really should give us pause. And so it really ran the concern from the kind of practical local kind of ground level community stuff to these bigger picture. What is this all even for? Why are we racing to support this?

</details>

**发言人**: 各位，他们来这里建造这个是有原因的。因为他们认为我们很蠢。他们认为没有人关心我们。他们认为我们很绝望。他们认为他们会逍遥法外。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: There's a reason they're coming here to build this, guys. It's cuz they think we're stupid. They think that no one cares about us. They think that we're desperate. And they think they're going to get away with it.

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 他们不信任摆在他们面前的未来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: They don't trust the future that is being presented to them.

</details>

**发言人**: 所以，你们唯一真正应该问自己的问题是，你们是否会再次相信工业的虚假承诺？谢谢你们的时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: So, the only real question that you should be asking yourselves is, will you once again believe the false promise of industry? Thank you for your time.

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 所以在所有这些证词之后，你来到了尾声。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: And so after all this testimony, you get to the end

</details>

**发言人**: 听完这些评论，我将接受一项动议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: And with those comments, I will take a motion.

</details>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: 已经是凌晨四点了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: It's like 4:00 a.m. WA

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 是的，这场会议开了一整夜。天哪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: And yes, this ran all night. Oh my gosh.

</details>

**发言人**: 否决动议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Motion to deny.

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 他们投票了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: They vote

</details>

**发言人**: 否决动议是7比2。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: It. The denial motion is 72 72 72 denial.

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 最终他们否决了这个项目。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: And ultimately they reject the project.

</details>

**发言人**: 动议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Motion.

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 他们决定够了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: They had decided enough,

</details>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: 也就是说，议会基本上已经说：“我们受够了。”所以，从社区的整体角度来看，这是**圣约瑟夫县**成功抵制这个数据中心的一场斗争。**Karen**，你是否看到了这种模式？我知道你正在关注全国各地的情况。其他地方是否也以这种方式联合起来，成功阻止了这些数据中心？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: Meaning the council essentially has said, "We're done with this." So, this was from the perspective of the community overall a successful fight against this one data center in St. Joseph County. Is that a pattern that you're seeing, Karen? I know you're looking at this across the country. Are other places coming together in this way and having success from blocking these data centers?

</details>

### 科技公司与政府的回应

**Karen Wise**: 是的，我的意思是这种情况正在发生。你看到社区拒绝项目，但在未来几年，建设量只会增加。你知道，所有公司都宣布了他们今年的投资计划，比去年多得多。我的意思是，我们今年将突破**5000亿美元**。所以现实是，公司需要这些项目发生，他们正在签署更多大合同。他们正试图同时在多个地方进行，因为他们确实面临着巨大的压力，需要尽快建成、供电并运营数据中心。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: Yes, I mean this is happening. You see communities reject projects, but the amount of building is only going to grow in the coming years. You know, the companies all announced their investment plans for this year and it is way more than last year. I mean, we're going to blow past half a trillion dollars this year. Wow. And so, the reality is the companies need this to happen. and they are signing more big deals. They are trying to go to multiple places at once because they they have a real pressure to get data centers built and powered and operational.

</details>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: 好的，我想谈谈这个。但首先，科技公司是如何应对这种抵制的？我的意思是，他们是否正在处理人们的担忧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: Okay, I want to talk about that. But first, how are the tech companies, if at all, responding to the push back? I mean, are they contending with the concerns people have?

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 是的。我的意思是，你开始看到他们更多地承认这些问题，有些是微妙的，有些则直接体现在品牌塑造上。所以，你越来越多地听到科技公司将数据中心称为**AI工厂**。每个人都喜欢工厂，因为它在经济中生产有用的东西，这当然是他们追求这个机会的原因，他们认为这是一个很好的机会，可以提高公司和个人的生产力。它可以，你知道，解决癌症等等所有这些问题，所以他们试图提升这种工业建筑的地位，并说它有助于这个未来。你还看到他们更多地承认社区可能想要什么。比如**Microsoft**发布了一项协议，称他们不会要求减免房产税。他们表示会在不同地点披露用水量。**Amazon**在**印第安纳州**的另一个项目中做出了非常可观的预付款承诺。我相信他们向他们计划建造新数据中心的一个小镇承诺了大约**1亿美元**。所以，你开始看到他们正在做出回应，而且他们也在积极参与政治活动。我的意思是，在这次听证会上就暴露出来了。人们说他们收到了短信，有人上门拜访，还有电视广告说要来支持这些项目。所以，他们正在传递一种信息，即这是未来。这是一个不可避免的未来，你应该成为它的一部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: Yes. I mean you're starting to see more acknowledgment of these issues and some are subtle some as literally branding. So increasingly you hear the tech companies talk about data centers more as AI factories. M everyone likes a factory in that it produces something useful in the economy and that is of course why they are trying to pursue this opportunity is they see it as a great opportunity that it can make companies and people more productive. It can you know solve cancer and all of these things and so they're trying to elevate this industrial building basically and say it contributes to this future. You also see more acknowledgments to what the community might want. Like Microsoft came out with a pact saying that they wouldn't ask for property tax breaks. They said that they would disclose water use in different locations. Amazon in a different project in Indiana made very substantial upfront financial commitments. I believe it was about hund00 million to this one town that they're looking to put a new data center in. So, you're starting to see ways that they're responding and they're also just activating politically. I mean, it came out in this hearing. People were saying they got text messages, they got doortodoor knockers, there were TV ads saying come support these projects. So, there's a sense that they're projecting of this is the future. This is an inevitable future and you should be part of it

</details>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: 你可以选择退出，但如果你选择退出，你可能会被抛在后面。你将无法获得那些税收。你将无法获得这些很棒的建筑工作，这些工作实际上可能更难被**AI**取代。你知道，你正在错过所有这些即将发生的机会，而你可以支持它们，你可以成为这样的人，因为这在你的社区里，你知道，我们在农村地区有更好的医生，你可以以一种奇怪的方式帮助解决癌症，因为这就是他们谈论的这些系统的潜在好处。所以他们正在推销这种说法，即这既是当地的经济利益，也是你正在参与的一场好的变革，你不想错过。对吧？所以这些公司正在明确地提高所有面临是否让这一切发生的决定的人的赌注。与此同时，联邦政府也在大力支持**AI**，并做了很多事情来加速这场**AI**革命。所以，这些社区也在与白宫和一位非常支持这一推动的总统抗争。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: And you can choose to opt out, but if you opt out, you could be left behind. you will not capture that tax revenue. You will not have these great construction jobs that actually maybe are harder to replace with AI. You know that you are missing out on all these opportunities that are going to happen and that you can support that you can be the person that because this is in your community, you know, we have better doctors in rural areas that you can help solve cancer in a weird way because that's what they're talking about of the potential benefits for these systems. And so they're making this cell that it is both an economic benefit locally but also you're part of a good transformation that is happening and you don't want to miss out. Right? So you have these companies kind of explicitly raising the stakes for all of the people that are now faced with the decision of whether to let this happen or not. And at the same time, you also have the federal government really doubling down on AI, too, and doing a lot to turbocharge this AI revolution. And so, these communities are also contending with a White House and a president that is very much behind this push.

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 绝对如此。是的。**特朗普**政府一直非常支持这一切。他们认为这是一个国家安全要务。这显然对于维持经济增长非常重要，他们也采取了一些措施，比如在联邦土地上快速审批数据中心。他们希望加快新电力来源和互联互通的建设，以及数据中心所需的类似设施。你甚至看到一些州开始考虑如何从地方政府手中收回权力，以避免这些分区问题或人们可以用来抵制它们的机制阻碍项目。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: Absolutely. Yeah. The Trump administration has been very supportive of all this. They see it as a national security imperative. It's obviously been very important for maintaining economic growth and they have done things like fasttrack data centers on federal land. They want to speed up the creation of new electricity sources and interconnections and things like that that you need for data centers. You've even seen some states start considering ways to claw back power from local governments over this and not wanting things to get held up by these zoning concerns or these mechanisms that people can use to resist them.

</details>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: **Karen**，我想知道你觉得这其中有多少是关于人们在**AI**革命中感到自己无法掌控。你知道，公司将其宣传为不可避免的。要么上车，要么火车就开走了。**特朗普**政府全力支持。如果你只是一个普通人，你可能会觉得**AI**总体上，特别是数据中心，所有这一切都像是强加给你的，你没有发言权。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Natalie Kitroeff**: You know, I wonder how much of this you feel, Karen, is about people feeling as though they don't have control in the middle of this AI revolution. You know, the companies are pitching this as inevitable. get on the train or the train's leaving the station without you. The Trump administration is fully behind it. And if you're just a regular person, you may feel like AI in general and data centers in particular, all of this is kind of just being imposed on you and you don't have a say in it.

</details>

**Karen Wise**: 我认为这是对的。你知道，你确实一遍又一遍地听到这些焦虑。但我也认为我们正在看到社区认识到自己的力量，他们确实拥有**地方自治权**。我的意思是，科技公司需要这些项目发生。这对他们来说至关重要。所以如果这些项目不断被叫停，对他们来说就是一个真正的问题，因为可以建造和做这些事情的地方就那么多。所以社区正在意识到他们确实拥有一些影响力。并非每个社区都如此，但你确实看到有些地方人们会退出项目，或者他们会搬迁或获得让步。这是一种新的动态，因为如果你有好的土地和电力，你现在实际上拥有极其宝贵的东西。所以人们正在学习如何在当地掌控局面。这不是通过联邦政策，而是通过那些小小的、没有窗户的房间，你坐在那里，听着数小时的社区听证会，说出你想要在社区中实现什么，这就是美国事物的结构方式，许多这些问题都有地方控制权，许多这些问题都有州控制权，人们正在找到这些施压点。这是**民主**在行动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Karen Wise**: I think that's right. You know, you you do hear those anxieties over and over again. But I also think that we're seeing ways communities are recognizing their own power and that they do have leverage. I mean the tech companies need these projects to happen. It is critical for them. And so it's a real problem for them if these keep getting shut down because there's only so many places where you can go and build and do this. And so communities are realizing that they do have some leverage. And it's not every community, but you do see places where people will pull out of projects, where they'll relocate or get concessions. And that is a kind of new dynamic because if you have good land and you have power, you actually have something extremely valuable right now. And so people are learning their way that locally they can take control. And it's not through federal policy. is through these like tiny little windowless rooms where you sit through hours and hours of community hearings saying what you want in your community and that is how things are structured in America and there is local control over many of these issues, state control over many of these issues and people are finding those pressure points. Democracy in action.
