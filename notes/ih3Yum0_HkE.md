### 市场概览与中国消费刺激政策

大家好，欢迎回到小崔时政财经。今天是美东时间2025年11月10日，欢迎收看本周的每日要闻节目。今天是一个令人振奋的日子，因为美国政府终于有望重新开门，资本市场普遍表现良好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello everyone, welcome back to Cui's Political and Financial Insights. Today is November 10, 2025, Eastern US time, and welcome to this week's Daily News program. Today is an exciting day because the US government is finally expected to reopen, and capital markets have generally performed well.</p>
</details>

我们先来看看A股市场表现。截至收盘，沪指上涨0.53%，深成指上涨0.18%，而创业板指下跌0.92%，呈现出逆势调整。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's first look at the performance of China's A-share market. As of the close, the Shanghai Composite Index rose by 0.53%, the Shenzhen Component Index rose by 0.18%, while the ChiNext Index fell by 0.92%, showing a counter-trend adjustment.</p>
</details>

在板块方面，大消费领域全面爆发，食品、白酒、免税店和旅游板块齐齐走强。化工股延续强势，硅能源概念股表现活跃。然而，CPO、铜缆、高速连接等算力硬件股开始调整，人形机器人概念股表现也不佳。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In terms of sectors, the broad consumer sector saw a comprehensive surge, with food, liquor, duty-free shops, and tourism sectors all strengthening. Chemical stocks continued their strong performance, and silicon energy concept stocks were active. However, computing power hardware stocks such as CPO, copper cables, and high-speed interconnects began to adjust, and humanoid robot concept stocks also performed poorly.</p>
</details>

消费板块之所以表现强劲，主要得益于11月7日财政部发布的《2025年上半年中国财政政策执行情况报告》。报告提到，将继续实施提振消费专项行动，对重点领域的个人消费贷款和相关行业经营主体贷款给予财政贴息。此外，路透社报道称，中国互联网平台正悄然恢复消费信贷业务，例如**蚂蚁集团**（Ant Group: 中国大型数字支付和金融科技公司）和**京东**（JD.com: 中国大型电商平台）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The strong performance of the consumer sector is mainly due to the "Report on the Implementation of China's Fiscal Policy in the First Half of 2025" released by the Ministry of Finance on November 7. The report mentioned that it would continue to implement special actions to boost consumption, providing fiscal interest subsidies for personal consumption loans in key areas and loans for operating entities in related industries. In addition, Reuters reported that Chinese internet platforms are quietly resuming consumer credit businesses, such as Ant Group and JD.com.</p>
</details>

然而，值得注意的是，今年前三季度个人消费贷款的不良率非常高。我观察到，银行打包出售的不良资产包主要都是个人消费贷款类。因此，我个人对网贷的再次崛起持保留态度，这可能导致更多人面临信用破产的风险。毕竟，刺激消费不应依赖贷款透支或补贴，而应通过增加人民收入来实现，但目前我们尚未看到中国政府在这方面有明确转变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, it is worth noting that the non-performing loan ratio for personal consumption loans in the first three quarters of this year was very high. I observed that the non-performing asset packages bundled and sold by banks were mainly personal consumption loans. Therefore, I personally remain reserved about the resurgence of online lending, which may lead to more people facing the risk of credit default. After all, stimulating consumption should not rely on loan overdrafts or subsidies, but should be achieved by increasing people's income, but currently we have not seen a clear shift in this regard from the Chinese government.</p>
</details>

明天就是“双11”购物节，相信近期关于“双11”的利好消息会较多，因此消费板块有望继续走强。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tomorrow is the "Double 11" shopping festival, and I believe there will be more positive news regarding "Double 11" recently, so the consumer sector is expected to continue to strengthen.</p>
</details>

### 存储芯片与中国机器人产业的“豪赌”

第二个重要消息是存储芯片大厂**闪迪**（SanDisk: 全球知名的闪存产品制造商）宣布上调**NAND闪存**（NAND Flash: 一种非易失性存储技术）合约价格，涨幅高达50%。美股方面，**美光科技**（Micron Technology: 全球领先的半导体公司）也因数据中心存储芯片销售强劲而大涨超过15%。今年内存行业异常火爆，三大模块制造商第三季度净利润均翻了好几倍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second important piece of news is that SanDisk, a major storage chip manufacturer, announced a contract price increase of up to 50% for NAND flash memory. In the US stock market, Micron Technology also surged over 15% due to strong sales of data center storage chips. The memory industry has been exceptionally hot this year, with the net profits of the three major module manufacturers multiplying several times in the third quarter.</p>
</details>

目前，晶圆厂正将更多生产线投入到用于**GPU**（Graphics Processing Unit: 图形处理器）和**AI加速器**（AI Accelerators: 专门用于加速人工智能计算的硬件）的尖端内存生产，导致消费级**固态硬盘**（SSD: 固态硬盘）和**嵌入式模块**（Embedded Modules: 用于特定功能集成的微型计算机系统）供不应求，从而使内存供应商利润暴涨。这背后都是**人工智能**（AI: 人工智能）技术发展的带动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Currently, wafer fabs are dedicating more production lines to the manufacturing of cutting-edge memory for GPUs and AI accelerators, leading to a supply shortage of consumer-grade SSDs and embedded modules, which in turn has caused memory suppliers' profits to surge. This trend is driven by the development of artificial intelligence technology.</p>
</details>

接下来我们关注机器人行业。今天，**高盛**（Goldman Sachs: 全球领先的投资银行和金融服务公司）发布了一份关于中国机器人的研报，其定调值得关注——“豪赌”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Next, let's focus on the robotics industry. Today, Goldman Sachs released a research report on Chinese robotics, and its characterization as a "gamble" is noteworthy.</p>
</details>

高盛在2025年11月3日至6日对中国的9家供应链企业进行了调研，其中包括著名的**三花智控**（Sanhua Intelligent Controls: 领先的制冷空调控制部件和汽车零部件制造商）。他们发现，大多数供应商正积极在海外（如泰国、墨西哥）规划产能，以支持潜在的**人形机器人**（Humanoid Robots: 具有人类形态和行为特征的机器人）大规模生产。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">From November 3 to 6, 2025, Goldman Sachs surveyed nine Chinese supply chain companies, including the renowned Sanhua Intelligent Controls. They found that most suppliers are actively planning production capacity overseas (such as in Thailand and Mexico) to support the potential mass production of humanoid robots.</p>
</details>

然而，**特斯拉**（Tesla: 美国电动汽车及清洁能源公司）曾表示，其机器人目前没有任何外部供应商，全部通过垂直整合自主制造。那么，像三花这样原先为特斯拉供货的公司，现在到墨西哥设厂，是否是为了进入特斯拉的机器人供应链？这尚不得而知。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, Tesla has stated that its robots currently have no external suppliers and are entirely manufactured in-house through vertical integration. So, are companies like Sanhua, which originally supplied Tesla, now setting up factories in Mexico to enter Tesla's robot supply chain? This remains unknown.</p>
</details>

这些供应商规划的产能规模在10万到100万台之间，显得相当激进。高盛自己预测，到2035年全球人形机器人的出货量也仅为138万台左右。而中国供应商提前10年布局，产能规模已达100万台左右，这无疑是一场基于预期的豪赌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The production capacity planned by these suppliers, ranging from 100,000 to 1 million units, appears quite aggressive. Goldman Sachs itself predicts that global humanoid robot shipments will only reach about 1.38 million units by 2035. Yet, Chinese suppliers are planning 10 years in advance, with a production capacity already around 1 million units, which is undoubtedly a speculative gamble based on expectations.</p>
</details>

高盛强调，在没有一家公司确认收到大规模订单或明确生产时间表的情况下，供应商应采取逐步爬坡的策略，而非像中国供应商这样“豪赌”提前扩大生产规模。这意味着存在一定的风险，即在生产尚未开始之前，就可能出现产能过剩。此外，这些供应商能否成功进入特斯拉等主要厂商的供应链也存在不确定性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Goldman Sachs emphasized that without any company confirming large-scale orders or clear production schedules, suppliers should adopt a gradual ramp-up strategy, rather than "gambling" on expanding production capacity prematurely like Chinese suppliers. This implies a certain risk of overcapacity even before production begins. Furthermore, there is uncertainty as to whether these suppliers can successfully enter the supply chains of major manufacturers like Tesla.</p>
</details>

中国在国家战略驱动下，往往会出现大量企业扎堆进入某一行业，电动车行业就是前车之鉴。目前，人形机器人尚未出现民用市场井喷的迹象，特斯拉自己的机器人也尚未量产并投入市场。在这种情况下，提前大规模布局可能面临利润压力，若市场未能进一步打开，仅靠国家补贴难以长期支撑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Driven by national strategies, China often sees a large number of enterprises flocking into a particular industry, with the electric vehicle sector serving as a precedent. Currently, there are no signs of a booming civilian market for humanoid robots, and Tesla's own robots have not yet entered mass production or the market. In this context, large-scale pre-emptive deployment may face profit pressures, and if the market does not further open up, relying solely on government subsidies will be difficult to sustain in the long run.</p>
</details>

### 黄金市场与港股动态

接下来是关于黄金的消息。今天黄金价格也上涨，这看似奇怪，但实际上反映了当前投资者的理性策略：在流动性注入时，风险资产和避险资产同时上涨，形成对冲。这延续了今年“股票和黄金齐涨”的投资逻辑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Next is news about gold. Gold prices also rose today, which seems strange, but in fact reflects the current rational strategy of investors: when liquidity is injected, both risk assets and safe-haven assets rise simultaneously, forming a hedge. This continues the investment logic of "stocks and gold rising together" this year.</p>
</details>

**中国黄金协会**（China Gold Association: 中国黄金行业的官方组织）公布数据显示，2025年前三季度黄金消费量同比下滑7.95%。其中，黄金首饰销量下降32.5%，但金条、金币等投资性黄金销量反而上涨24.55%，工业用金销量也上涨2.72%。前三季度国内黄金**ETF**（Exchange Traded Fund: 交易型开放式指数基金）增仓量同比上涨164%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The China Gold Association announced data showing that gold consumption in the first three quarters of 2025 fell by 7.95% year-on-year. Among them, sales of gold jewelry decreased by 32.5%, but sales of investment gold such as gold bars and coins increased by 24.55%, and industrial gold sales also rose by 2.72%. The increase in domestic gold ETF holdings in the first three quarters surged by 164% year-on-year.</p>
</details>

这表明中国人正从消费黄金饰品转向投资黄金。一方面，消费能力下降使得购买昂贵饰品的需求减少；另一方面，缺乏其他好的投资渠道，许多人选择投资今年表现良好的黄金。这从数据上反映出中国消费需求不旺，而从股市、银行理财等领域挤出的投资需求依然旺盛，投资者风险偏好较低。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This indicates that Chinese people are shifting from consuming gold jewelry to investing in gold. On the one hand, declining consumer spending reduces the demand for expensive jewelry; on the other hand, lacking other good investment channels, many choose to invest in gold, which has performed well this year. This data reflects weak consumer demand in China, while investment demand squeezed out from areas like the stock market and bank wealth management remains strong, indicating a low-risk appetite among investors.</p>
</details>

说完A股，我们来看看港股。截至收盘，恒生指数上涨1.55%，恒生科技指数上涨1.34%。具体来看，消费股领涨，白酒、旅游、零售板块与A股走势一致。科技股也表现良好，例如**腾讯**（Tencent: 中国领先的互联网科技公司）上涨2%。有分析认为，第三季度财报中，腾讯的盈利数据可能相对乐观。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">After discussing A-shares, let's look at Hong Kong stocks. As of the close, the Hang Seng Index rose by 1.55%, and the Hang Seng Tech Index rose by 1.34%. Specifically, consumer stocks led the gains, with liquor, tourism, and retail sectors moving in line with A-shares. Technology stocks also performed well, for example, Tencent rose by 2%. Some analyses suggest that Tencent's earnings data in the third quarter may be relatively optimistic.</p>
</details>

个股方面，**泡泡玛特**（Pop Mart: 潮流文化娱乐公司）上涨8%，**比亚迪**（BYD: 中国新能源汽车制造商）上涨4%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In terms of individual stocks, Pop Mart rose by 8%, and BYD rose by 4%.</p>
</details>

然而，对**小米**（Xiaomi: 中国智能手机和智能硬件制造商）有一个不利消息。**国家市场监督管理总局**（State Administration for Market Regulation: 中国负责市场综合监督管理的国务院直属机构）正在讨论虚假营销认定方案，后续将针对汽车行业的夸大营销和虚假宣传进行整治。小米在国内的口碑因夸大营销和虚假宣传而一落千丈，**雷军**（Lei Jun: 小米创始人兼CEO）的粉丝数量也大幅下降。市场监管总局的介入，明显是对小米的警示，因此我对小米的后市并不乐观。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">However, there is unfavorable news for Xiaomi. The State Administration for Market Regulation is discussing a scheme for identifying false marketing, and will subsequently crack down on exaggerated marketing and false advertising in the automotive industry. Xiaomi's reputation in China has plummeted due to exaggerated marketing and false advertising, and Lei Jun's fan base has also significantly decreased. The intervention of the State Administration for Market Regulation is clearly a warning to Xiaomi, so I am not optimistic about Xiaomi's future market performance.</p>
</details>

### 日本的“战狼外交”与财政新政

说完中国，我们来说说日本。今天日本发生了一起严重的“战狼外交”事件。11月7日，日本高市早苗在众议院接受质询时，针对“台湾有事”表态称，一旦台湾遭到中国动用军舰等武力攻击并危及日本存亡时，日本政府可能行使集体自卫权。她的表态本身并无问题，因为涉及国家存亡，行使自卫权是合理之举。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">After discussing China, let's talk about Japan. Today, a serious "wolf warrior diplomacy" incident occurred in Japan. On November 7, when asked in the House of Representatives about a "Taiwan contingency," Japanese official Sanae Takaichi stated that if Taiwan were attacked by China using military force, such as warships, and Japan's survival were endangered, the Japanese government might exercise its right to collective self-defense. Her statement itself was not problematic, as exercising self-defense is a reasonable action when the nation's survival is at stake.</p>
</details>

然而，中国驻日本大阪总领事**薛进**（Xue Jin: 中国驻大阪总领事），一位著名的“战狼”外交官，在社交平台引用日媒报道威胁称：“我们只好毫不犹豫斩下那擅自闯入的肮脏脖子，做好觉悟了吗？”此言论血腥且具有人身威胁意味，在日本民间引起极大震动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, Xue Jin, the Chinese Consul General in Osaka, Japan, a renowned "wolf warrior" diplomat, quoted a Japanese media report on social media, threatening: "We will have no choice but to unhesitatingly sever those dirty necks that trespass without authorization. Are you prepared?" This remark was bloody and personally threatening, causing great shock among the Japanese public.</p>
</details>

尽管薛进随后删除了该提问，但他继续发布其他恐吓言论，例如“台湾有事就是日本有事，是日本部分愚蠢政治家选择的死亡之路”，“违反作为战败国应该履行的义务，不要再遭受如同战败的民族性灭亡”等。这种威胁恐吓式的外交辞令，在以往中国外交中较为罕见，但在当前领导人任期内频繁出现，严重损害了中国的国际形象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Although Xue Jin later deleted the post, he continued to publish other intimidating remarks, such as "A Taiwan contingency is a Japan contingency, a path to death chosen by some foolish Japanese politicians," and "Violating the obligations that a defeated nation should fulfill, do not suffer national annihilation again as a defeated nation." Such threatening and intimidating diplomatic language was relatively rare in past Chinese diplomacy but has become frequent under the current leadership, severely damaging China's international image.</p>
</details>

战狼外交官们并非销声匿迹，而是在适当的时机，根据上层的意图再次出现。这种外交方式虽然迎合了某些喜好，但对中国的国际关系和人民形象都极为不利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wolf warrior diplomats have not disappeared; rather, they reappear at opportune moments, according to the intentions of higher authorities. While this diplomatic approach may cater to certain preferences, it is extremely detrimental to China's international relations and the image of its people.</p>
</details>

在经济方面，日本高市早苗暗示将削弱以往政府对财政整顿的承诺，表示将制定一项持续数年的新财政目标，以赋予政府开支更大的灵活性，但仍会强调财政纪律。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On the economic front, Sanae Takaichi of Japan hinted at weakening the government's previous commitment to fiscal consolidation, stating that a new multi-year fiscal target would be set to provide greater flexibility for government spending, while still emphasizing fiscal discipline.</p>
</details>

日本经济增长委员会专家小组建议，日本将致力于在不提高税收的情况下实现更高的财政收入，并考虑在经济方案中纳入芯片、关键矿物和国防领域。高市早苗还表示，不排除未来降低消费税的可能性。这符合她之前提出的财政政策，即先减轻日本民众的通胀负担，通过降税、补贴等措施稳定生活，再通过政府投资和带动关键产业来刺激经济增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">An expert panel of Japan's Economic Growth Council recommended that Japan would strive to achieve higher fiscal revenue without raising taxes, and consider including chips, critical minerals, and defense sectors in its economic package. Sanae Takaichi also stated that the possibility of future consumption tax cuts cannot be ruled out. This aligns with her previously proposed fiscal policy, which aims to first alleviate the inflation burden on the Japanese public, stabilize livelihoods through tax cuts and subsidies, and then stimulate economic growth through government investment and driving key industries.</p>
</details>

我们关注日本央行和财政之间的配合能力。如果高市早苗能在财政适当扩张但不影响货币稳定的情况下实现政策目标，她将成为一代传奇人物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We are closely watching the coordination capabilities between the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance. If Sanae Takaichi can achieve her policy goals with appropriate fiscal expansion without compromising monetary stability, she will become a legendary figure.</p>
</details>

### 美国政府重开、特朗普新政与医保争议

接下来是美国的消息。美国政府终于要开门了，今天股市和加密货币市场普遍大涨，主要受此重大利好消息影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Next, news from the United States. The US government is finally about to reopen, and today, both the stock market and cryptocurrency markets have seen broad gains, primarily driven by this significant positive news.</p>
</details>

11月10日，美国参议院正式通过了新的持续拨款法案，该法案将为政府提供资金至1月30日，以结束政府停摆。赞成票60票，反对票40票。政府关门40天，终于有望重新开门，尽管仍需众议院通过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On November 10, the U.S. Senate officially passed a new continuing appropriations bill, which will fund the government until January 30, ending the government shutdown. The vote was 60 in favor and 40 against. After 40 days, the government shutdown is finally expected to end, although it still needs House approval.</p>
</details>

政府关门已导致美国经济损失严重，并引发交通管制、人员短缺等秩序混乱，对航空安全影响巨大。最近取消了大量航班，甚至发生了一起飞机坠毁事件。因此，政府不能再继续关门，两党终于达成协议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The government shutdown has caused severe economic losses in the United States and led to chaos such as traffic control and personnel shortages, significantly impacting aviation safety. Numerous flights have been canceled recently, and there was even a plane crash. Therefore, the government could not remain shut down, and the two parties finally reached an agreement.</p>
</details>

政府开门对市场是重大利好，因为财政部**TJA账户**（Treasury General Account: 美国财政部在美联储的存款账户）中的大量资金将得以拨付，为股市注入流动性。此外，10月是美国新财年的第一个月，特朗普在7月推出的“大美利法案”（包括减税、补贴、放松监管等政策）因政府关门未能落地，现在政府开门后将持续实施。这意味着财政宽松将彻底落实，加上**美联储**（Federal Reserve: 美国中央银行系统）的货币宽松，未来股市将继续看好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The government reopening is a major positive for the market, as a large amount of funds from the Treasury General Account will be disbursed, injecting liquidity into the stock market. Furthermore, October marks the first month of the new US fiscal year, and the "Great American Act" (including tax cuts, subsidies, and deregulation policies) introduced by Donald Trump in July failed to materialize due to the government shutdown, but will now be continuously implemented after the government reopens. This means that fiscal easing will be fully implemented, and coupled with the Federal Reserve's monetary easing, the stock market is expected to continue its positive trend in the future.</p>
</details>

此次短期拨款法案中，民主党做出了较大妥协，未能实现延长**奥巴马医保**（Affordable Care Act: 美国前总统奥巴马推行的医疗改革法案）税收抵免政策的主要诉求。共和党坚决反对奥巴马医保补贴，民主党最终做出让步。该政策原定于12月底到期，预计将不再延续。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In this short-term appropriations bill, the Democratic Party made significant concessions, failing to achieve their main demand of extending the tax credit policy for the Affordable Care Act. Republicans firmly opposed ObamaCare subsidies, and the Democrats ultimately conceded. This policy, originally set to expire at the end of December, is not expected to be extended.</p>
</details>

协议还要求撤销政府关门期间的所有永久性裁员，并保护此类减员措施持续到2026财年结束，以确保所有联邦雇员在政府停摆期间都能获得正常工资。此外，还提供了补充营养援助计划（SNIP）和退伍军人事务所所需的资金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The agreement also requires the reversal of all permanent layoffs during the government shutdown and protects such reduction-in-force measures until the end of fiscal year 2026, ensuring that all federal employees receive normal wages during the government shutdown. Additionally, it provides necessary funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNIP) and the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>
</details>

我认为**唐纳德·特朗普**（Donald Trump: 美国前总统）政府对奥巴马医保的立场是坚决的，取消奥巴马医保是合理的。联邦政府每年需拨付巨额资金给奥巴马医保，这笔钱最终流向保险公司。特朗普认为，与其补贴保险公司，不如直接将钱发给人民，由人民自主决定是否购买保险。这体现了典型的右派观点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I believe the Donald Trump administration's stance on ObamaCare is firm, and its cancellation is reasonable. The federal government allocates a huge sum of money to ObamaCare annually, which ultimately goes to insurance companies. Trump believes that instead of subsidizing insurance companies, it is better to distribute the money directly to the people, allowing them to decide whether to purchase insurance independently. This reflects a typical right-wing viewpoint.</p>
</details>

左派（民主党）主张大政府，强制要求民众购买保险，由政府替民众做决定。然而，如果遵循市场经济规律，人民应该有选择不购买医疗保险的权利。美国的医保费用高昂，对普通中产家庭（年收入7-10万美元）而言，强制购买医保可能导致每年1万美元左右的支出，这还不包括自付、共付部分和药品费用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The left (Democrats) advocate for a large government, mandating that citizens purchase insurance, with the government making decisions for the people. However, if market economic principles are followed, people should have the right to choose not to purchase health insurance. Healthcare costs in the United States are exorbitant, and for an average middle-class family (earning $70,000-$100,000 annually), mandatory health insurance could lead to annual expenses of around $10,000, not including deductibles, co-pays, and prescription drug costs.</p>
</details>

高额医保负担曾造成“中产灾难”。例如，一些中产家庭为了避免高额医保支出，选择让其中一方不工作，从而使家庭收入降至贫困线以下，反而能获得免费的“白卡”（Medicaid: 美国联邦和州政府合作的医疗补助计划）及其他福利。这导致许多本不需要政府福利的中产家庭主动“降阶”，消灭了中产阶级，扩大了民主党的基本盘。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">High healthcare burdens once caused a "middle-class disaster." For example, some middle-class families, to avoid high healthcare expenses, chose to have one spouse stop working, thereby reducing household income below the poverty line, which then qualified them for free "white cards" (Medicaid) and other benefits. This led many middle-class families, who otherwise wouldn't need government welfare, to voluntarily "downgrade," thereby eroding the middle class and expanding the Democratic Party's base.</p>
</details>

如果一个政党一直声称代表穷人，它只会制造更多的穷人，因为这是它的票仓。相反，如果一个政党声称代表富人，它可能会制造更多的富人。民主党的福利政策存在漏洞，导致许多人发现工作不如领取福利，从而选择继续处于底层，永远依赖政府福利，并投票给民主党。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If a political party consistently claims to represent the poor, it will only create more poor people, as this constitutes its voter base. Conversely, if a political party claims to represent the rich, it might create more rich people. The Democratic Party's welfare policies have loopholes, leading many to find that working is less beneficial than receiving welfare, thus choosing to remain at the bottom, perpetually relying on government benefits, and voting for the Democratic Party.</p>
</details>

我认为奥巴马医保确实应该取消。在市场经济中，个人应该有权选择是否购买保险，并承担相应风险。美国的医疗系统问题重重，联邦政府的介入和兜底只会让问题变得更大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I believe ObamaCare should indeed be abolished. In a market economy, individuals should have the right to choose whether to purchase insurance and bear the corresponding risks. The American healthcare system is plagued with problems, and federal government intervention and backstopping will only exacerbate them.</p>

### 英伟达财报与AI产业展望

我们接着来说说个股情况，特别是**英伟达**（Nvidia: 全球领先的GPU制造商和AI计算公司）。上周英伟达股价小幅下跌，但跌幅有限，不像**AMD**（AMD: 另一家领先的半导体公司）跌幅更大。今天美股盘前大涨时，英伟达回涨约3%。本周英伟达将公布财报，多家投行纷纷看好并上调其目标价。

<p class="english-text">Let's continue with individual stock performance, especially Nvidia. Last week, Nvidia's stock price saw a slight decline, but the drop was limited, unlike AMD, which experienced a larger fall. Today, during pre-market trading, Nvidia rebounded by about 3% amidst a broad market rally. Nvidia is scheduled to release its earnings report this week, and several investment banks are optimistic, raising their price targets.</p>
</details>

上周末，**黄仁勋**（Jensen Huang: 英伟达创始人兼CEO）亲自前往台湾，向**台积电**（TSMC: 全球最大的专业集成电路制造服务公司）争取产能，并表示“没有台积电就没有英伟达”。他此前刚去韩国，随后又到台湾，足见其对产能的重视。台积电10月份销售额同比增长16.9%，环比大涨11%，产能供不应求。黄仁勋此行正是为了从台积电抢到更多产能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Last weekend, Jensen Huang, the founder and CEO of Nvidia, personally visited Taiwan to secure production capacity from TSMC, stating that "without TSMC, there would be no Nvidia." His prior visit to South Korea, followed by Taiwan, underscores his emphasis on production capacity. TSMC's sales in October increased by 16.9% year-on-year and surged by 11% month-on-month, indicating that demand outstrips supply. Huang's trip was precisely to secure more production capacity from TSMC.</p>
</details>

英伟达希望成为台积电3纳米制程的主要客户之一，预计将占据约30%的总产量。作为“卖铲子”和“造铲子”的强强联合，它们共同构成了AI行业的上游。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nvidia aims to be one of TSMC's primary 3-nanometer process customers, projected to account for approximately 30% of the total output. As a powerful alliance of "shovel sellers" and "shovel makers," they collectively form the upstream of the AI industry.</p>
</details>

我一直认为英伟达是一家非常优秀的公司。目前，七大科技巨头在AI赛道上主要依靠自有现金流，杠杆率极低。例如，英伟达的负债仅约10亿美元，而现金储备超过50亿美元，杠杆率几乎为零（0.1）。相比之下，**甲骨文**（Oracle: 全球大型企业级软件公司）的杠杆率高达四五倍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have always considered Nvidia an excellent company. Currently, the seven major tech giants primarily rely on their own cash flow in the AI race, with extremely low leverage. For instance, Nvidia's debt is only about $1 billion, while its cash reserves exceed $5 billion, resulting in almost zero leverage (0.1). In contrast, Oracle's leverage ratio is as high as four to five times.</p>
</details>

像**微软**（Microsoft: 全球领先的软件和科技公司）的杠杆率也仅为20%。除了甲骨文和**Meta**（Meta Platforms: Facebook母公司），其他公司尚未开始大规模加杠杆。这意味着这些公司未来仍有巨大的举债空间，可以筹集数千亿甚至上万亿美元资金。因此，AI行业还有很长的烧钱周期，目前无需担心泡沫问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Companies like Microsoft also have a leverage ratio of only 20%. Apart from Oracle and Meta, other companies have not yet begun to significantly increase leverage. This means these companies still have enormous room for future borrowing, capable of raising hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars. Therefore, the AI industry has a long cash-burning cycle ahead, and there is no need to worry about a bubble issue at this stage.</p>

### 特朗普的房地产与财政新政

说完股市，我们来说说宏观经济。未来几天，我们需要关注特朗普的一些财政政策。10月是美国新财年的第一个月，特朗普的“大美利法案”将落地。我曾提醒大家，今年年底特朗普会对房地产市场下手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">After discussing the stock market, let's talk about macroeconomics. In the coming days, we need to pay attention to some of Donald Trump's fiscal policies. October marks the first month of the new US fiscal year, and Trump's "Great American Act" will be implemented. I previously reminded everyone that Trump would target the real estate market by the end of this year.</p>
</details>

他推出的第一招让我有些意外：提议为美国人提供50年房贷。这有些哗众取宠，因为一旦房贷期限超过30年，月供下降幅度微乎其微，而利息会高得惊人。30年是房贷的最优选择，超过30年意义不大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">His first move surprised me: proposing 50-year mortgages for Americans. This is somewhat sensationalist, because once a mortgage term exceeds 30 years, the reduction in monthly payments is negligible, while the interest becomes astonishingly high. 30 years is the optimal choice for a mortgage; anything beyond that holds little significance.</p>
</details>

美国房价基本上不可能被打下来，因为一旦房子拥有了金融属性，其价格只会越来越贵。美元持续发行，资金必然流向资产。房地产的居住属性靠后，土地有限，因此房价上涨是底层逻辑，难以改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">US housing prices are essentially impossible to bring down, because once a house acquires financial attributes, its price will only become more expensive. With the continuous issuance of the US dollar, money will inevitably flow into assets. The residential attribute of real estate takes a backseat, and land is limited, so rising housing prices are a fundamental logic that is difficult to change.</p>
</details>

特朗普政府原先提出的一些解决房价问题的想法，例如增加土地供给、加速建商开发等，其实都很好，但尚未落地。他却先行推出了50年房贷，这可能会给年轻人一种错觉，认为特朗普没有能力打压房价，而只是用这种方式短期内“欺骗”民众。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some of the ideas the Trump administration originally proposed to solve housing price issues, such as increasing land supply and accelerating developer construction, were actually very good, but have not yet been implemented. Instead, he first introduced 50-year mortgages, which might give young people the false impression that Trump is unable to curb housing prices and is merely using this method to "deceive" the public in the short term.</p>
</details>

然而，在未来的AI时代，我们或许会看到房地产“去金融化”的一天，所有人都有房子住真的有可能实现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">However, in the future AI era, we might witness a day when real estate is "de-financialized," and it is truly possible for everyone to have a place to live.</p>
</details>

此外，特朗普还提到要给美国人发放2000美元的关税分红（高收入人群除外）。对此，美国财政部长**珍妮特·耶伦**（Janet Yellen: 美国财政部长）表示，这个想法可能更多是通过“大美利法案”的减税措施来实现，而非直接发钱。耶伦作为“管账的”，显然更倾向于减税而非直接发放现金，因为直接分红会大幅减少财政部的现金储备。这表明特朗普可能未与耶伦商量便发布了此消息，这2000美元的分红能否兑现尚不确定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Furthermore, Donald Trump also mentioned distributing a $2,000 tariff dividend to Americans (excluding high-income earners). In response, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stated that this idea might be realized more through the tax cut measures of the "Great American Act" rather than direct cash payments. As the "accountant," Yellen clearly prefers tax cuts over direct cash distribution, as direct dividends would significantly reduce the Treasury's cash reserves. This indicates that Trump might have announced this news without consulting Yellen, and whether the $2,000 dividend will materialize remains uncertain.</p>
</details>

### 中国其他政策与外资动向

我们再来说说中国。中国对**芬太尼**（Fentanyl: 一种强效合成阿片类止痛药）的出口管制确实已经实施。中国商务部调整了向特定国家出口易制毒化学品的管理目录，将美国、墨西哥、加拿大全部增列入特定国家行列，并单独增列了针对这三个国家的13种易制毒化学品。**美国联邦调查局**（FBI: 美国司法部的主要调查机构）局长**克里斯托弗·雷**（Christopher Wray: FBI局长）上周也访问中国，讨论芬太尼和执法问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's talk about China again. China's export controls on Fentanyl have indeed been implemented. The Ministry of Commerce of China adjusted the management catalog for exporting precursor chemicals to specific countries, adding the United States, Mexico, and Canada to the list of specific countries, and separately adding 13 types of precursor chemicals specifically for these three countries. FBI Director Christopher Wray also visited China last week to discuss Fentanyl and law enforcement issues.</p>
</details>

其次，中美原先贸易谈判商定的一些措施，中国现在陆续都在实施。例如，暂停对**韩华海洋株式会社**（Hanwha Ocean: 韩国大型造船公司）5家美国相关子公司的制裁。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">Secondly, China is now successively implementing some measures previously agreed upon in US-China trade negotiations. For example, sanctions against five US-related subsidiaries of Hanwha Ocean have been suspended.</p>
</details>

关于**ASML**（ASML: 荷兰半导体设备制造商）事件，我之前的判断再次得到证实。上周我曾说，ASML自己拉高股价，而荷兰方面根本没有妥协。今天商务部证实，中方注意到荷兰经济大臣的声明，但截至目前，尚未见到荷兰在停止侵害中国企业合法权利的实际行动。这表明荷兰只是口头表态，并未采取实际行动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Regarding the ASML incident, my previous judgment has been confirmed once again. Last week, I mentioned that ASML itself drove up its stock price, while the Netherlands had made no concessions. Today, the Ministry of Commerce confirmed that China noted the statement by the Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs, but as of now, has not seen any actual action from the Netherlands to cease infringing upon the legitimate rights of Chinese enterprises. This indicates that the Netherlands has only made verbal statements without taking concrete action.</p>
</details>

此外，**国家计算机病毒应急处理中心**（National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center: 中国国家级的计算机病毒应急处理机构）11月9日发布报告，分析了**柬埔寨太子集团**（Prince Group (Cambodia): 柬埔寨大型综合性企业集团）价值150亿美元的比特币被美国政府没收事件。报告结论称，这是典型的国家级黑客组织操盘的“黑吃黑”事件，这反映出中方对此笔资金被没收感到“肉疼”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In addition, the National Computer Virus Emergency Response Center released a report on November 9, analyzing the incident where $15 billion worth of Bitcoin belonging to the Prince Group (Cambodia) was confiscated by the US government. The report concluded that this was a typical "black-on-black" incident orchestrated by a state-level hacker organization, reflecting China's "pain" over the confiscation of these funds.</p>
</details>

另一个消息是**汉堡王**（Burger King: 全球知名快餐连锁品牌）将出售中国股份，这与**星巴克**（Starbucks: 全球知名咖啡连锁品牌）的操作非常相似。中国私募股权公司**CPE源峰**（CPE Yuanfeng: 中国领先的私募股权投资机构）买走了汉堡王中国83%的股份，而原母公司**餐饮品牌国际**（Restaurant Brands International: 汉堡王、Tim Hortons等母公司）保留17%股权。他们的计划是将汉堡王在中国的门店规模从目前的1250家扩展到2035年的4000家，这显然是引入中国私募基金，走低端扩张路线以适应中国市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Another piece of news is that Burger King will sell its Chinese stake, a move very similar to Starbucks' operation. Chinese private equity firm CPE Yuanfeng acquired 83% of Burger King China's shares, while the original parent company, Restaurant Brands International, retained a 17% stake. Their plan is to expand Burger King's store count in China from the current 1,250 to 4,000 by 2035, which clearly involves introducing Chinese private equity and adopting a low-end expansion strategy to adapt to the Chinese market.</p>
</details>

最后，**国务院办公厅**（State Council General Office of China: 协助国务院处理日常事务的机构）印发了《关于进一步促进民间投资发展的若干措施》，提出了13项针对性政策举措。其中有三条值得关注：

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Finally, the State Council General Office of China issued "Several Measures to Further Promote the Development of Private Investment," proposing 13 targeted policy initiatives. Among them, three are particularly noteworthy:</p>
</details>

第一，提到要用好支持小微企业融资协调工作机制，银行业金融机构应制定民营企业年度服务目标。这旨在强制银行向民营企业放贷，但由于不是出于市场行为，银行仍会考虑风险。因此，真正需要钱的民营企业依然难以获得贷款，这些资金只会流向那些大型、不缺钱的民营企业，以帮助银行完成指标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First, it mentioned the need to make good use of the coordinated working mechanism to support financing for small and micro enterprises, and banking financial institutions should formulate annual service targets for private enterprises. This aims to compel banks to lend to private enterprises, but since it is not driven by market behavior, banks will still consider risks. Therefore, private enterprises genuinely in need of funds will still find it difficult to obtain loans, and these funds will only flow to large, well-funded private enterprises to help banks meet their targets.</p>
</details>

第二，引导民间资本有序参与低空经济领域基础设施建设。为了让民营企业帮助政府搞基建，航空航天、卫星等原先由国企垄断的领域都向民企开放。这并非政府好心，而是因为缺钱，希望哄骗民企出资搞基建。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Second, guiding private capital to orderly participate in infrastructure construction in the low-altitude economy. To encourage private enterprises to help the government with infrastructure projects, sectors previously monopolized by state-owned enterprises, such as aerospace and satellites, are now open to private enterprises. This is not out of government goodwill, but due to a lack of funds, hoping to entice private enterprises to invest in infrastructure.</p>
</details>

第三，推出“创新积分制”引导金融资源精准聚焦服务科技型企业。中国政府试图通过这种计划经济式的打分和考核方式来扶持民营企业，例如要求政府采购必须有多少份额给到民企。然而，这很容易滋生腐败，例如国有企业可以设立民企“白手套”来完成指标，肥肉依然流不到外面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Third, launching an "innovation points system" to guide financial resources to precisely focus on serving technology-oriented enterprises. The Chinese government is attempting to support private enterprises through this planned economy-style scoring and assessment method, for example, by requiring a certain proportion of government procurement to go to private enterprises. However, this easily breeds corruption, as state-owned enterprises can set up private enterprise "fronts" to meet targets, and the benefits still won't flow outside.</p>
</details>

总而言之，中国政府这些扶持民企的方式都显得非常幼稚和反市场，充满了计划经济的余毒，不可能真正让经济复苏，只会消耗大量资源，最终可能将国家带向毁灭。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In summary, these methods used by the Chinese government to support private enterprises appear very naive and anti-market, full of the vestiges of a planned economy, making it impossible for the economy to truly recover. They will only consume vast resources and ultimately may lead the nation to ruin.</p>
</details>

### 问答环节

**问：** 给民企放贷，让他们投资各类大基建，好像可以闭环，最终民企帮买单？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Q:** Lending to private enterprises and letting them invest in various large infrastructure projects seems like a closed loop, with private enterprises ultimately footing the bill?</p>
</details>

**答：** 确实如此，这就像是骗他们的钱。如果民企没有利润，怎么会来投资呢？中国总是搞这种不务正业的政策，因为他们不太相信市场经济。特别是当前领导人，一路都在“倒车”，走回计划经济。计划经济模式不可能让经济复苏，只会消耗大量资源，将国家带向毁灭。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**A:** Indeed, it's like swindling their money. If private enterprises don't see profit, why would they invest? China constantly engages in such unproductive policies because they don't fully trust market economics. Especially the current leadership, who has been "reversing course" all the way, returning to a planned economy. A planned economy model cannot revive the economy; it will only consume vast resources and lead the nation to ruin.</p>
</details>

**问：** 今天黄金暴涨？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Q:** Gold surged today?</p>
</details>

**答：** 是的，我之前说过，因为流动性预期变好，财政部将倾倒大量资金。今年的投资逻辑一直是“一边对冲，一边买美股”。所以一旦流动性宽裕，无论是避险资产还是风险资产都会上涨。今年的投资逻辑就是一边避险，一边买风险资产，因此黄金和美股出现同步上涨的趋势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**A:** Yes, as I said before, because liquidity expectations have improved, the Treasury Department will inject a large amount of funds. This year's investment logic has consistently been "hedging while buying US stocks." So, once liquidity becomes abundant, both safe-haven and risk assets will rise. This year's investment logic is to hedge while buying risk assets, hence the synchronized upward trend in gold and US stocks.</p>
</details>

**问：** 人手2000美元？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Q:** $2,000 per person?</p>

<p class="english-text">**A:** It's not that easy to distribute; it might not materialize.</p>
</details>

**问：** **房利美**（Fannie Mae: 美国政府赞助的抵押贷款公司）最近还有消息会上市吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Q:** Is there any recent news about Fannie Mae going public?</p>
</details>

**答：** 据说还在谈。美国政府一定会托管，但最终脱手并重新上市，我觉得是可以看到的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**A:** Reportedly, discussions are still ongoing. The US government will certainly take it into conservatorship, but I believe its eventual divestiture and relisting are foreseeable.</p>
</details>

**问：** 哪天不看好**英特尔**（Intel: 全球领先的半导体公司）的时候？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Q:** When will you stop being optimistic about Intel?</p>
</details>

**答：** 目前都看好。AI这个赛道才刚刚开始，还不至于出现大的波动。我基本上都比较看好头部那几家企业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**A:** Currently, I'm optimistic. The AI sector has just begun, and it's not yet at a point where major fluctuations would occur. I'm generally quite optimistic about the leading companies in this space.</p>
</details>

**问：** 这段时间大规模查仓，电商补税？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Q:** There's been a large-scale inventory check and e-commerce tax补 lately?</p>
</details>

**答：** 是的，我今天看到**第一财经**（China Business News: 中国领先的财经媒体）发消息说，杭州、上海很多投资美股的人都收到电话要求补税。他们确实现在很缺钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**A:** Yes, I saw China Business News report today that many people in Hangzhou and Shanghai who invest in US stocks have received calls demanding back taxes. They are indeed very short on money right now.</p>
</details>

**问：** CPI数据基本上不用看？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Q:** CPI data is basically not worth looking at?</p>
</details>

**答：** 是的，CPI影响不大。我说过，今年“反内卷”什么的，稍微把数据抓一抓，波动只会在零点几，没有意义。经济都没有复苏，CPI根本就不会上去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**A:** Yes, CPI has little impact. As I said, this year's "anti-involution" and so on, just grab a bit of data, and the fluctuation will only be in the tenths of a percent, which is meaningless. The economy hasn't recovered, so CPI won't go up at all.</p>
</details>

**问：** 最近医改利空美国保险业吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**Q:** Is the recent healthcare reform bearish for the US insurance industry?</p>
</details>

**答：** 这种小的利空不太要紧。你看**沃伦·巴菲特**（Warren Buffett: 著名投资家，**伯克希尔·哈撒韦**（Berkshire Hathaway: 巴菲特执掌的多元化投资控股公司）董事长兼CEO）还在抄底**伯克希尔·哈撒韦**的保险业务呢。他们整个产业护城河太高了，联邦政府给不给钱都不要紧。所以你觉得这是利空，在我看来波澜不惊，不算什么利空。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">**A:** Such minor negative news is not very significant. Look, Warren Buffett is still buying the dip in Berkshire Hathaway's insurance business. Their entire industry has too high a moat; it doesn't matter whether the federal government provides money or not. So, what you perceive as negative news, in my view, is merely a ripple, not a significant bearish factor.</p>
