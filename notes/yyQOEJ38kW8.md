### 英国经济的“厄运循环”与全球压力

Joe Weisenthal：大家好，欢迎收听新一期的**OddLots播客**（OddLots podcast: 彭博社出品的经济与金融播客）。我是Joe Weisenthal。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to another episode of the OddLots podcast. I'm Joe Weisenthal.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway：我是Tracy Alloway。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I'm Tracy Aloway.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：Tracy，我们录制这期节目是在2025年8月26日。现在有很多事情正在发生，尤其是在世界上一些最富裕的国家，关于宏观经济、治理以及各种问题都有许多重大疑问。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tracy, we're recording this August 26th, 2025. There's a lot going on right now, particularly in I guess many big questions about macro and governance and all kinds of things in some of the richest countries in the world.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway：这当然是一种说法。就在一夜之间，我们看到了头条新闻，称特朗普将解雇美联储的丽莎·库克。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That is certainly one way to put it. So just overnight we had headlines saying that Trump was going to fire Lisa Cook from the Fed.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：这显然符合围绕**央行独立性**（Central Bank Independence: 中央银行在制定货币政策时不受政府干预的原则）以及政府对央行应有多大影响力的整个辩论。事实证明，这种辩论我们以前在其他国家也曾有过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And this obviously fits into the whole debate around central bank independence and how much influence governments should actually have on central banks. And it turns out this is a debate that we've had before in other countries.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway：完全正确。我认为特朗普关注美联储的部分原因在于高额的利息支付，他希望看到它们下降。说到利息支付，今天早上我看到头条新闻说英国30年期**金边债券**（gilt: 英国政府发行的长期债券）收益率达到了1989年以来的最高水平，并且还在持续攀升。所以，尽管我们这里面临着各种压力，包括财政压力和通胀压力，但其他地方的情况似乎可能更糟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Totally. And part of the reason I think Trump is focused on the Fed is the high level of interest payments and he'd like to see them come down. Speaking of interest payments, this morning I saw the headline that the UK 30-year guilt is like at the highest since 1989. It continues to elevate. So for all the stress that we have here, all the fiscal pressure, inflationary pressure, it actually seems potentially worse elsewhere. Although yes,</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：我会说英镑兑美元是上涨的，对吗？所以从货币角度来看，我们表现得更差。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I will say the pound is up against the dollar, right? So from a currency perspective, we're kind of doing worse.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway：从货币角度来看是这样，但这些事情是全球性的，我认为这就是重点。所有这些焦虑和压力，不仅仅是美国的故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">from a currency uh perspective, but there's a lot these things are global is I think the point and all of these anxieties and stresses, it's not just a US story.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：是的。显然，这正在影响债券市场，我无法告诉你我们每天收到多少关于政府如何减少债务、如何处理赤字等问题的报告。现在，2025年，每个人都在谈论这些。当然，在2022年英国金边债券收益率出现著名飙升之后，这引起了极大的关注，这也许预示着许多富裕国家将面临的问题。所以，我非常高兴地说，我们今天确实请到了最合适的嘉宾来谈论所有这些，以了解发达经济体所面临的一些压力。我们正在与尊敬的莉兹·特拉斯女士交谈，她是英国前首相，也是最近出版的《拯救西方十年》一书的作者。莉兹·特拉斯，非常感谢您来到OddLots。很高兴能邀请到您。

<details>

<p class="english-text">No. And obviously it's feeding into bond markets and I cannot tell you how many notes we get on a daily basis about how governments can reduce the debt, how they deal with deficits and things like that. Right now, everyone's talking about this these days here in 2025. It got a lot of interest, of course, in 2022 after there was a famous spike in yields in UK guilts and maybe this sort of premonition of what a lot of rich countries would be dealing with. So, I'm very excited to say we really do have the perfect guest to speak about all of this today to understand some of the pressures facing rich developed economies. We're speaking with the right honorable Liz Truss, former prime minister of the UK, author of the recent book 10 years to save the West. Liz Truss, thank you so much for coming on OddLots. Thrilled to have you here.</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：很高兴能来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good to be on.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：我有一个问题。当您看到30年期金边债券收益率远高于您担任首相时，以及当所有人因您的**迷你预算**（mini budget: 2022年9月英国政府提出的一系列大规模减税和支出计划，引发市场剧烈波动）而攻击您时，您是否感到某种程度的平反或高兴，还是对您国家的现状感到绝望？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have a question. You know, when you see like 30-year guilt yields higher substantially than when you were the prime minister and when everyone attacked you over the mini budget, do you feel some sense of like sort of vindication or happiness or is it all like despair for the state of your country? Well, I do feel despair for the state of my country and it's in fact why</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：我确实对我的国家现状感到绝望，事实上，这就是为什么我在2022年试图做我所做的事情，因为我能看到事态的发展方向。我能看到我们的经济停滞不前，税收不足以支付国家的开支。我们需要做些不同的事情才能摆脱负面螺旋。而我现在看到的是，我们进一步陷入了那个负面螺旋，并且正走向一场非常非常严重的危机。我去年说过，我认为我们正走向**IMF救助**（IMF bailout: 国际货币基金组织向面临严重经济困难的国家提供财政援助，通常附带严格的经济改革条件），就像英国在1970年代经历的那样。我认为现在比一年前更是如此。我们正处于高税收、低增长、高债务的经济**厄运循环**（economic doom loop: 指经济体陷入一种自我强化的负面循环，如高债务导致高税收，高税收抑制增长，低增长又导致更高债务）中。现在很难看到摆脱这种困境的政治出路。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I tried to do what I tried to do in 2022 because I could see the way things were going. I could see our economy was stagnant, that the tax revenue being generated wasn't enough to cover the amount of money the state was spending. And we needed to do something different in order to get out of a negative spiral. And what I see now is we're further down that negative spiral and we are heading for a very very serious crisis. I said last year I thought we were headed for an IMF bailout as Britain experienced in the 1970s. I think that's even truer now than it was a year ago. And we're in an economic doom loop of higher taxes, lower growth, higher debt. And it's very difficult now to see the political way out of that.</p>
</details>

### 政策制定与机构阻力

Joe Weisenthal：那么，政府应该如何宣布或推出大规模的政策转变呢？因为似乎存在一些体制上的限制，以及市场反应。我们今年在美国看到了这一点，在特朗普的“解放日”声明之后，很多人说这是特朗普的“特拉斯时刻”。政府应该如何平衡市场观点与大规模的政策变革呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So how should governments actually announce or unveil largecale policy shifts? Because there does seem to be a some institutional constraint and then b the market reaction. We saw that this year in the US after Trump's liberation day announcement. You know a lot of people were saying this was Trump's trust moment. How should governments actually go about I guess balancing the views of the market with you know big scale change in terms of policy? I think</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：我认为我面临的问题，也是唐纳德·特朗普在美国面临的问题，是许多主流经济建制派不认同我当时推行的政策，他们也不认同唐纳德·特朗普正在推行的政策。所以你是在一个充满敌意的环境中运作。就英国而言，我们有一些机构已经与政府政策严重脱节。1998年，戈登·布朗使英格兰银行独立。从那时起，我认为它基本上是不负责任的。因此，政治家对货币政策的控制非常少。而发生的情况是，货币政策驱动了财政政策。作为一个政府，你很难协调这两种政策，因为你无法控制这些杠杆。更甚的是，早在2010年，乔治·奥斯本成立了**预算责任办公室**（Office of Budget Responsibility, OBR: 英国的一个独立公共机构，负责对政府的公共财政进行独立分析和预测），它将巨大的权力交给了另一个非民选机构。它有点像美国的**国会预算办公室**（Congressional Budget Office, CBO: 美国国会的一个非党派机构，为国会提供经济和预算信息），但在英国体系中拥有更大的权力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the issue that I faced and it is also the issue that Donald Trump faces in the United States is a lot of the mainstream economic establishment do not agree with the policies that I was pursuing and they don't agree with the policies that Donald Trump is pursuing. So you're operating in a hostile environment. In the UK's case, we have institutions that have become very divorced from government policy. In 1998, the Bank of England was made independent by Gordon Brown. Since then, I believe it has been pretty much unaccountable. So, politicians have very little control over monetary policy. And what has happened is monetary policy has driven fiscal policy. It's very hard to coordinate between those two policies as a government because you don't have control of the levers. Even more so, back in 2010, George Osborne established the Office of Budget Responsibility, which handed over huge powers to another unelected authority. It's a bit like the Congressional Budget Office, but it has more power within the British system.</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：所以我在2022年面临的是强大的机构，它们不认同我的政策目标。我认为作为国家民选的领导人，我应该能够推行这些政策。这是我当选的基础。事实上，这也是保守党当选的基础。但我面临的是阻力。所以当你谈论政策宣布的时机时，你不是在一个平静的海面上运作。你是在一个波涛汹涌的海面上运作，那里有人希望你失败。不仅仅是你的政治对手，还有体制内的对手。这就是唐纳德·特朗普在“解放日”宣布关税政策时所面临的。许多经济学家说它们不会奏效。许多人说这会使美国的预算赤字恶化，而那些政策制定者对市场非常有影响力。因此，无论是英格兰银行，还是美联储的成员，或是财政部的公务员，这些人都正在制造自己的波澜。所以，我认为这就是你必须看待我当时试图做的事情的背景。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what I was facing back in 2022 was powerful institutions that didn't share my policy objectives. Now I believed as the democratically selected leader of the country that I should be able to pursue those policies. It was what I was elected on. In fact, it was what the Conservative Party elected on. But what I faced was resistance. So when you're talking about timing of policy announcements, it's not like you're operating on a a clear sea. You're operating in a stormy sea where there are people out there who want you to fail. Not just your political opponents, but also the institutional opponents. And that is what Donald Trump faced with his tariff policies that he announced on Liberation Day. A lot of economists said they wouldn't work. A lot of people say said it would make the budget deficits in the US worse and those policy makers are very influential with the markets. So in the case of the bank of England or the case of the people sitting on the Federal Reserve or civil servants within the Treasury, these people are out there creating their own waves. So I think that's the context you have to see what I was trying to do. First of all, I</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：首先，我完全理解您关于许多主流经济学家的局限性以及他们偏见的观点，我们节目中也经常邀请许多主流经济学的批评者。所以，这一点说得很好。当您公布您的迷你预算时，考虑到财政限制或感知到的财政限制，为什么是减税，而不是同时削减开支呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">totally take your point about the sort of limitations of many mainstream economists, the bias of many mainstream economists, and we have many critics of mainstream economics regularly on the show. So, that's a point well taken. When you unveiled your mini budget, given the fiscal constraints or the perceived fiscal constraints, why tax cuts specifically and not also spending cuts? You know, there's so many</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：你知道，英国的支出状况有许多不同的方面，无论是**三锁养老金**（triple lock pension: 英国政府养老金政策，保证每年按通胀、平均工资增长或2.5%三者中最高者上调）。Twitter上经常流传一个关于如何轻松获得免费汽车等福利的帖子。为什么不首先针对那些可能容易实现的目标，或者至少结合起来，削减开支呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">different aspects of the UK spending situation, whether it's the triple lock pension. There's this thing that goes viral on Twitter a lot about like how easy it is to get a free car, etc. Like, why not first take aim at potentially lowhanging fruit or at least in combination, you know, spending cuts.</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：嗯，那正是我努力去做的。我们提出的方案是一个组合。它实际上不是减税，而是逆转增税。我认为这是一个非常重要的区别。我们想采取的最大措施是将公司税保持在19%，而不是提高到25%。我当时相信，并且后来也证明我是对的，如果你将公司税提高到那个水平，你会减少商业活动，你会获得更低的增长，再加上已经实施的**非定居者税**（non-dom tax: 针对在英国居住但其永久住所不在英国的个人征收的税），或者取消非定居者福利。我们看到离开英国的百万富翁人均比世界上任何其他国家都多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, that is exactly what I sought to do. The package we were putting forward was a combination. It was actually not tax cuts. it was reversing a tax rise. And I think that's a very important distinction. The biggest measure we wanted to take was keeping corporation tax at 19%, not raising it to 25%. And I believed, and I've since been proven right, that if you raise corporation tax to that level, you get less business activity, you get lower growth, combined with the non-dom tax that's been put in place or the removal of the non-dom benefits. We've seen more millionaires leave Britain than any other country in the world per capita.</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：所以，我们当时在2022年那个关头提高税收本身就是一个糟糕的主意。我相信这会在长期内导致更低的经济增长和更高的赤字。一些经济学家同意我的观点，但为政府工作的经济学家，即预算责任办公室和英格兰银行的经济学家，不同意我的观点，他们热衷于那项政策，事实上，他们迫使我逆转了那项政策。所以这是第一点。关于开支的第二点是，我们确实试图控制开支。我特别想做的一件事是按工资而不是按物价增加福利，因为2022年是通胀非常高的一年。那将为政府预算节省70亿英镑，这是一个相当大的数目。我发现保守党议员不准备投票支持这项措施。因此，即使是一个相对较小的改变，仅仅是不像原计划那样大幅提高福利，也在保守党内部引起了巨大的强烈反对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what we were doing just on its own account, raising taxes at that juncture back in 2022 was a bad idea. I believe that it would lead to lower economic growth and a higher deficit in the long term. And some economists agreed with me, but the economists working for the government, the office of budget responsibility of the bank of England did not agree with me and they were keen on that policy and in fact they forced me to reverse that policy. So that's one point. Second point on spending is we did try to rein in spending. So a particular thing I sought to do was increase welfare by wages not prices because we were in a very high inflation year in 2022. That would have saved 7 billion pounds on the government budget which is a significant amount. What I found was that Conservative MPs were not prepared to vote for that. So even a relatively minor change which was simply not raising welfare as much as it was going to be raised created a massive outcry on on the conservative benches.</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：所以，关于开支的答案是，这在政治上是不可能的。现在，我个人本希望在开支方面更加强硬。我认为我们本可以随着时间的推移做到这一点，但我必须考虑政治上现实的可能性。所以我们当时的做法是限制开支，不让开支像之前计划的那样大幅增加，保持低税收而不是提高税收并扼杀经济增长，我认为这正是提高税收会做到的，也正是实际发生的情况。然后还有**供应侧措施**（supply side measures: 旨在通过提高生产效率和降低生产成本来刺激经济增长的政策），例如在英国合法化**水力压裂**（fracking: 一种通过向地下岩层注入高压液体来开采天然气和石油的技术），使北海钻探更容易，从而通过供应侧改革刺激经济。这就是整体方案，你知道发生了什么，你可以将我的财政方案与里希·苏纳克在新冠疫情期间的方案或雷切尔·里夫斯此后的方案进行比较。即使根据预算责任办公室的估计，我的方案也更小。然而，它却得到了非常不同的反应。这是因为经济建制派，财政部和英格兰银行的关键人物，对**凯恩斯主义**（Keynesian approach: 一种经济理论，主张政府通过财政和货币政策干预经济，以实现充分就业和经济稳定）方法抱有偏见。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the answer on spending is it was politically not possible. Now personally I would have liked to be even tougher on spending. I think we could have done that over time but I had to think about what was politically realistic. And so what we had is spending constraint, not raising spending as much as was previously planned, keeping taxes low rather than raising them and choking off economic growth, which is what I thought it would do and was what actually happened. And then also supply side measures such as legalizing fracking in the UK, making it easier to drill in the North Sea so that you stimulate the economy with supply side reforms. That was the overall package and you know what happened and you can compare my fiscal package with packages that Richie Sunnak did during COVID or packages that Rachel Ree did since. My package was smaller even according to the estimates of the office of budget responsibility. And yet it got a very different reaction. And this is because the economic establishment, the key figures in the Treasury and the Bank of England have a bias towards a more Keynesian approach.</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：所以，我认为重要的是要注意，这个财政方案并不比之前或之后的方案更大。它只是得到了不同的反应。我认为关于2022年9月和10月发生的事情，另一个重要的点是，在迷你预算前夜，英格兰银行宣布出售价值400亿英镑的金边债券。所以，在迷你预算前一天，中央银行发布了让我们的生活变得更加困难的公告。自2022年金边债券飙升以来，英格兰银行实际上已经发表了一份报告，称金边债券飙升的三分之二是由于他们未能监管养老金市场。所以当时还有很多其他事情正在发生，但将发生的一切归咎于迷你预算是非常非常方便的。正如您在节目开始时指出的，当时的金边债券飙升并没有现在这么高。所以，我认为现在正在发生的是，你可以看到一个高税收、高支出的工党政府与一个保守派政治家（在我看来，她试图推行更友好的税收冻结、供应侧改革和支出限制）所受到的不同待遇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I I think it's important to note that this this fiscal package was not any bigger than packages before or after. It just got a different reaction. I think the other the other important point to note about what happened in September and October 2022 is the night before the mini budget, the Bank of England announced the sale of 40 billion pounds worth of guilts. So I had a central bank who were making announcements that made our lives a lot more difficult the day before the mini budget. And since the guilt spike in 2022, the Bank of England have actually produced a paper saying that 2/3 of that spike in guilts was down to their failure to regulate the pensions market. So there were lots of other things going on at the same time, but it was very very convenient for the mini budget to be blamed for what happened. And as you pointed out at the beginning of the show, the guilt spike wasn't as high as it is now. So what I think is going on now is you can see the different treatment of a tax spending, high-spending Labor government from a conservative politician who's trying to pursue, in my view, laugher, curb friendly tax freezes, supply side reforms, and spending restraint.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：如果存在一种制度和市场对经济正统观念或凯恩斯主义的偏见，正如您刚才指出的，为什么不尝试调整您的预算或经济政策以适应这种现实呢？因为看起来，您似乎期望市场适应您的政策，而不是反过来。我想问的是，有没有更好的方法来传达您当时正在做的事情？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If there's an institutional and market bias towards economic orthodoxy or Keynesianism as you just pointed out, why not try to adapt your budget or your economic policy to that reality? Because it it did seem like, you know, you were sort of expecting the markets to adapt to your policy rather than vice versa. I guess I'm asking is just is there a better way to try to communicate what you were doing at the time?</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：嗯，我是一个民主的信徒，我认为政策应该由民选政治家决定，而不是非民选的中央银行。你知道，有一个网络，国际货币基金组织、世界银行、中央银行定期开会。在我看来，它们在决定一个国家的经济政策方面权力过大，而且它们并没有发挥作用。你知道，如果你看看英格兰银行过去十年在通货膨胀、经济增长等方面的记录，那是非常糟糕的。我从根本上认为，为什么民选政治家要屈服于非民选官员的意愿，而我们才是对政策的成功或失败负责的人？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I'm a believer in democracy and I think it's democratically elected politicians that should decide policy, not unelected central banks. And you know, there is a network, there's the IMF, the World Bank, the central banks meeting regularly. They are far too powerful in my view at deciding what country's economic policy should be and they have not been effective. You know, if you look at the Bank of England's record over the past 10 years on things like inflation, on economic growth, it's been extremely poor. And I fundamentally, you know, why should democratically elected politicians cow to what unelected officials want when we're the people who are held to account for the success of failures of the policy?</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：现在正在发生的是，雷切尔·里夫斯非常正统。她曾是英格兰银行的雇员。她基本上是在听从英格兰银行和财政部的指令，关于她应该做什么。我们可以看到这样做的结果。正在发生的是，我们将达到一个终点，国家将耗尽资金，然后我们将面临一场重大危机，我们将不得不以不同的方式思考。我只是觉得事情发展到这个地步非常令人遗憾。从2022年我们所处的位置来看，这本是显而易见的，但正如我所说，经济正统观念被证明非常强大。坦率地说，如果你只是随波逐流于已经让你的国家陷入困境的失败正统观念，那么成为首相的意义何在？这就是我们当时所处的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what is happening now is Rachel Reeves is very orthodox. She's a former Bank of England employee. She's essentially taking dictation from the Bank of England and the Treasury about what she should do. And we can see the results of that. And it what is happening is we are going to reach an end point where the country runs out of money and then we will have a major crisis and we will have to think differently. I just think it's very sad it's got to that point. This was obvious from where we were in 2022, but as I've said, the economic orthodoxy proved very powerful. And frankly, what is the point of wanting to become prime minister if you're simply going to go along with the failing orthodoxy that has put your country in the problems it is already, which is where we were.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：您提到英格兰银行直到戈登·布朗在1990年代担任财政大臣时才真正独立于财政部。您认为这种安排仍然有效吗？或者您是否会呼吁改革，让财政部重新获得对中央银行的一些影响力？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, you mentioned that the Bank of England wasn't really independent from HM Treasury until Gordon Brown's chancellorship in the 1990s. Do you think that arrangement still works or would you perhaps call for reform where maybe the Treasury regains some of its influence over the central bank?</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：我认为英格兰银行需要对政治家负责。我认为目前的体系行不通。这就是为什么我非常同情唐纳德·特朗普关于美联储的说法。货币政策极其重要。它决定了社会内部资产的分配。你知道，我们在英国看到的是，那些拥有房产、拥有资本的人，从英格兰银行过去15年创造的低利率和宽松货币中获益。而我们看到年轻人难以进入住房市场。我们正在经济中看到英格兰银行政策的实际影响。作为一个民主主义者，一个相信民主的人，我只是觉得由那些不对选民负责的人做出这些决定是错误的。而且，正如我担任首相时发现的，如果你不掌握其中一个杠杆，就很难将财政和货币政策结合起来。所以，是的，我认为它必须改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the Bank of England needs to be accountable to politicians. I think the current system doesn't work. This is why I'm very sympathetic to what Donald Trump is saying about the Fed. it. Monetary policy is incredibly important. It determines the allocation of assets within society. You know, what we've seen in Britain is we've seen people who have, you know, property, who have capital out of the low interest rates that the Bank of England and the easy money the Bank of England has created over the past 15 years. And we're seeing young people struggle to get on the housing market. We are seeing it real effects in the economy of the Bank of England's policies. And as a Democrat, you somebody that believes in democracy, I just think it's wrong that people should be making those decisions and not accountable to the electorate. And it's also very difficult, as I found as prime minister, to combine fiscal and monetary policy if you don't hold one of the levers. So yes, I think it's got to change.</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：我认为清算即将到来，不仅在英国，在美国，在欧洲央行也是如此。目前的体系行不通。我认为英格兰银行之所以（我想说）破坏我当时试图做的事情，原因之一是我在成为首相之前就是中央银行的批评者。我一直非常明确地表示，我认为英格兰银行的记录不佳，财政部应该在制定英格兰银行的职权范围方面发挥更大的作用，而他们不喜欢自己的权力受到挑战。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think there is a reckoning coming for the central banks, not just in Britain, but also in the United States, also the ECB. The current system does not work. And I think one of the reasons that the Bank of England, I would say, sabotaged what I was trying to do is I was a critic of central banks before I became prime minister. I'd been very clear that I thought the Bank of England's record was not good, that the Treasury should have much more of a role in setting the mandate for the Bank of England and they didn't like their power being challenged.</p>
</details>

### 财政紧缩、政治现实与危机

Joe Weisenthal：首先，我想说，您关于削减开支在政治上不可能或至少很困难的观点非常重要，而且您拥有保守党多数席位，即使您所描述的对支出增长率进行适度削减也无法获得选票，我认为这是一个非常说明问题的问题，并引发了对任何民主国家能否做困难事情的担忧。撇开下一届议会可能在政治上能够做的事情不谈，下一届议会是否应该重新审视诸如**三锁养老金**或**国民医疗服务体系**（NHS: National Health Service: 英国的公共资助医疗保健系统，提供免费医疗服务）免费使用等问题？

<p class="english-text">First of all, I want to say I think your point about the sort of the political impossibility of or the political at least difficulty of spending cuts is really important and the fact that you had the Tory majority obviously and even what you describe as sort of modest cuts to the rate of growth spending couldn't get the votes like I think there's a very telling issue and raises a stress about the ability of any democracies to do difficult things. Setting aside maybe what's politically capable in the next parliament should the next parliament revisit questions such as either the triple lock pensions or free point of use at the NHS.</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：所以，关于政治可能性，我认为目前唯一政治上可能的事情，或者说2022年肯定可能的事情，是尝试限制支出的增长。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So just on your point about political possibility I think the only thing that is politically possible at present or certainly was in 2022 was to try and restrain the growth of spending.</p>

Joe Weisenthal：并使经济增长快于此。我认为这就是……

Liz Truss：我认为你刚才说的关于实际削减开支的事情，只有在某种危机发生时才有可能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that is only possible what you've just said about actually spending cuts. Yeah. Is when there is some kind of crisis.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：嗯，这就是我说的。您去年提到，您担心英国可能需要另一次IMF救助。就在上周的新闻中，我记得有一些经济学家再次谈论这个问题。好的，如果这就是我们正在谈论的，我的意思是，如果这是真的，而且我们正在谈论英国基本上处于需要IMF救助的地步，那么现在是不是时候审视现有支出水平的这些核心支柱了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, so this is what I'm saying. So you mentioned you said last year that you were worried that the UK could need another IMF bailout. There were headlines I think in the news just in the last week of some economists talking about that again. Okay, like if this is what we're talking about, I mean, if this is real and we're talking about the UK essentially being at the point of needing an IMF bailout, is it time to look at these sort of core pillars of existing spending levels?</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：嗯，你可以看到议会里发生的事情，工党试图通过一些适度的福利削减，但工党议员却发生了大规模的叛乱。即使他们在议会中拥有巨大的多数席位，他们也无法通过一些相当小的改变。顺便说一下，这比我2022年提议的金额还要小。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, you can see what's been going on in parliament, which is the Labor Party tried to put through some modest welfare cuts and there was a massive rebellion by Labor MPs. Even though they have a huge majority in parliament, they could not get through some pretty minor changes. Smaller by the way, than the amount I was proposing in 2022,</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：我认为这只值大约40亿英镑。他们无法通过他们目前的议会党团，而所有证据，你知道希腊发生的事情，爱尔兰发生的事情，以及阿根廷是另一个很好的例子，这些地方的削减开支计划都是在危机之后才实现的。我认为这非常令人遗憾，但我看不到，至少在目前的议会中，在英国资金耗尽之前，会发生严重的削减开支。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it was only worth about4 billion pounds. They could not get that through their current parliamentary party and all of the evidence you know what happened in Greece, what happened in Ireland where spending cut programs have been achieved or Argentina is another good example have come after a crisis. I think that's deeply regrettable but I can't see certainly with the current parliament serious spending cuts happening until until Britain runs out of money.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway：我将以稍微不同的方式问Joe的问题，但如果您今天再次执政，并且金边债券收益率保持在目前的水平，您愿意在开支和税收、减税之间做出哪些具体的权衡？您认为哪些权衡在政治上是现实的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm going to ask Joe's question just in a slightly different way, but if you were back in government today and guilt yields are where they are, what specific tradeoffs between spending and taxes, tax cuts would you be willing to make? And what trade-offs do you think are actually politically realistic?</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：嗯，现在的问题是税收已经变得如此之高，以至于它们正在扼杀经济增长，我们看到百万富翁正在离开这个国家。我们看到企业正在倒闭。我认为最容易和最明智的立即做的事情是所有供应侧的事情。废除规划法规，应对环境**非政府组织**（NOS's: Non-governmental organizations），继续**水力压裂**，利用北海石油，也许利用我们的煤炭储备。我认为这些是可以相对较快完成并产生影响的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, the issue now is that taxes have got so high that they're choking off economic growth and we're seeing millionaires leaving the country. We're seeing businesses closing down. I think the easiest thing and the most sensible thing to do straight away is all the supply side stuff. Abolishing planning regulations, taking on the environmental NOS's, getting on with fracking, using North Sea oil, maybe using our coal reserves. I think those are the types of things that can be done relatively quickly and would have an impact.</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：在开支方面，当然，我们的福利国家需要改革。我认为英国预算的60%以上是**国民医疗服务体系**和福利的组合。而这两个领域需要解决。但我认为现在在税收方面已经没有回旋余地了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In terms of spending, of course, our welfare state needs to be reformed. I think something like over 60% of Britain's budget is a combination of the National Health Service and welfare. And those are the two areas that need to be fixed. But I don't think there's any room for maneuver now on taxes.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：嗯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mhm.</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：我认为提高税收已经被证明是适得其反的。做得更多只会让英国对投资者来说更没有吸引力。所以，你必须专注于供应侧，让建造东西变得更容易，让水力压裂变得更容易，让雇佣人员变得更容易，所有这些事情。你必须尽可能地削减开支。但是，正如我所说，我自己也曾试图通过议会削减开支。这并不容易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that raising taxes has proved already to be counterproductive. Doing it even more will simply make the UK even more unattractive for investors. So, you've got to focus on supply side, make it much easier to build things, make it much easier to frack, make it much easier to hire people, all of those kind of things. And you have to have spending cuts where you can. But, as I've said, I've tried myself to get spending cuts through parliament. It's It's not easy.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：我将问一个非常无知的美国式问题，有时会显得直白，如果这听起来很直白，请原谅我。我只是想把它说出来，但在英国，**NHS**（National Health Service: 英国的公共资助医疗保健系统，提供免费医疗服务）是否存在一种狂热崇拜？

<p class="english-text">I'm gonna ask a really ignorant American question that sometime so forgive me if this comes off as blunt. I just so I'm just getting it out there, but is there a cult at the NHS in the UK?</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There has been I think the cult is wearing thin,</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：但你知道，过去确实有过这种狂热。不过，我认为人们正在认识到结果并不好。你知道，如果你将英国的医疗健康结果与其他国家进行比较，我认为美国体系没有什么值得效仿的，但如果你看看德国这样的国家……

<p class="english-text">but you know there has been a cult.

<p class="english-text">True. That's what I would say.</p>
</details>

### 凯恩斯主义的盛行与机构捕获

Tracy Alloway：没错。我想回到您之前说的关于经济正统观念倾向于凯恩斯主义的观点。您认为这是为什么？为什么在目前，尽管您一直指出，很多人会认为它实际上并没有为发达国家带来好的结果，但它仍然是主导的经济政策框架？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">True. I want to go back to something you said about the economic orthodoxy uh leaning towards Keynesianism. Why do you think that is? Like why is that the dominant economic policy framework at the moment given that as you keep pointing out you know a lot of people would argue that it hasn't actually yielded good outcomes for the developed world in the 80s we had some very successful supply side policies both thatcher and Reagan increased economic growth increased the strength of our respective economies and when the Soviet Union collapsed I think we all thought free market capitalism had won. Low taxes, restrained spending, supply side economics.</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：我认为支持这些政策的人放松了警惕，这使得更多左翼经济学获得了影响力。从那时起，我认为我们在大学、财政部和英格兰银行都看到了凯恩斯主义经济学变得更加普遍。无论是预算责任办公室还是国会预算办公室，他们都在通过凯恩斯主义的视角看待经济学。我认为这是一个大问题，即在看到这些政策的成功以及现在看到凯恩斯主义政策的失败之后，任何人怎么可能认为这些政策是正确的。但它们被证明很难改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think people in favor of those policies took their foot off the pedal and that allowed more left-wing economics to gain traction. And since then I think we've seen it in universities in the Treasury in the Bank of England but the Keynesian economics has become much more prevalent and whether it's the office of budget responsibility or the CBO they're looking at economics through a Keynesian lens and I think it is a big question about how on earth after seeing the success of those policies and now seeing the failure of Keynesian policies, anyone could possibly think these policies are right. But they've proved very hard to shift.</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：我认为政治左翼在占领机构方面非常成功。我认为他们已经占领了大部分官僚机构、大学和大部分媒体。你知道，在英国，你知道，仅仅谈论2022年的事件，并没有对发生的事情以及英格兰银行做了什么以及这些机构如何表现进行真正的分析，这是一个不被谈论的话题。我认为媒体的经济素养水平也降低了，当然，英国政治只是被报道成一场哑剧，而不是对问题的分析。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think the left of politics have been very successful at capturing institutions. I think they've captured large parts of the bureaucracy, the universities, large parts of the media. you know there was you know in Britain there has not you know just talking about these the events of 2022 there's not been real analysis of what happened and what the bank of England did and how the institutions behaved you it's something that is not talked about and I think the level of economic literacy in the media is also got lower and certainly British politics just gets reported as a pantomime time rather than an analysis of the issues.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：您对媒体和报道方式的许多说法，我可能非常同情。您会加入改革党吗？如果保守党无法实现福利增长速度的适度放缓，如果工党显然有其问题，您会加入改革党吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's much you say about the media and the way reporting is done that I probably am quite sympathetic with actually. Would you ever join reform? If the conservatives can't p modest slowdowns in the pace of welfare increases if you know labor obviously has its issue issues, would you join reform?</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：我目前并没有真正考虑党派政治，因为我整个政府任职的经历，我在成为首相之前担任了10年的政府部长，就是权力不在政治家手中，权力在官僚手中。所以即使奈杰尔·法拉奇在2029年当选，目前他是博彩公司最看好的人选，如果官僚机构不改变，如果英国的运作方式没有根本性的改变，那么什么都不会改变。我的意思是，很多……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm not really thinking about party politics at the moment because my whole experience of being in government and I was a government minister for 10 years before I became prime minister was that the power was not in the hands of the politicians the h power was in the hands of the bureaucrats. So even if Nigel Farage gets elected in 2029, and currently he's the bookie's favorite to get elected, if the bureaucracy isn't changed, if there isn't fundamental change to the way Britain is run, nothing will alter. I mean, a lot of</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：大概，大概是解散……我的意思是，对吧，这就是想法，对吧？除非政治上真正发生一些新的事情，否则官僚机构就没有解散的可能。那将是他们的论点，对吧？一个全新的政党上台是实现某种深层体制改革的唯一途径。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">presumably presumably a break up of the I mean, right, like that's the idea, right? There's no prospect of breaking up the bureaucracy unless there's like genuinely something new that happens politically. Like that would be their argument, right? that a brand new party taking power is the only way that there could be some sort of deep institutional shakeup.</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：是的，在某些方面这是真的，或者可能是真的。保守党没有理由不能进行深层体制改革。但保守党必须承认过去14年出了什么问题。你知道，我们为什么没有解决移民问题？为什么没有解决增长问题？为什么没有解决言论自由等问题？答案是我们没有逆转托尼·布莱尔所做的体制变革。我谈到了他如何使英格兰银行不负责任。他还通过**人权法案**（Human Rights Act: 英国议会通过的法律，将欧洲人权公约的权利纳入英国法律）和**宪法改革法案**（Constitutional Reform Act: 英国议会通过的法律，改革了司法系统和上议院）使司法机构不负责任。所以，除非保守党承认这就是我们执政失败的原因，否则关于保守党的说法是正确的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, in some ways that's true or could be true. There's no reason why the Conservative Party couldn't do a deep institutional shakeup. But the Conservative Party has to acknowledge what went wrong for 14 years. You know, why didn't we solve the immigration problem? Why didn't we solve the growth problem? Why didn't we solve things like the free speech problem? The answer is we didn't reverse the institutional changes Tony Blair made. And I talked about how he made the Bank of England unaccountable. He also made the judiciary unaccountable with things like the Human Rights Act and the Constitutional Reform Act. So until the Conservatives acknowledge that that is why we failed to deliver in office, that is true about the Conservative Party.</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：但如果你看看特朗普的两届政府，特朗普一和特朗普二，你知道，在特朗普一时期，对美国所需的体制变革认识不足，而我们现在从特朗普那里看到了更多。所以我的观点是，无论谁在2029年执政，都需要明白英国的国家需要从根本上进行改革，否则什么都不会发生。我向所有政党提出这个论点。有趣的是，甚至工党后座议员中也有人说英格兰银行的独立性需要取消。他们说要废除预算责任办公室，因为他们可以看到他们希望推行的政策在目前的设置下是不可能实现的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But if you look at the two Trump administrations, Trump one and Trump 2, you know, in Trump one, there was less recognition of the institutional change that was required in the US and we're now seeing more of that from Trump. So my point is whoever is in office in 2029 needs to understand that the British state needs to be fundamentally shaken up otherwise nothing is going to happen. And I make that argument to all parties. Interestingly there are even people in the Labour party backbench MPs who are saying the Bank of England's independence needs to be removed. They're saying get rid of the office of budget responsibility because they can see the types of policies they want pursued are not possible with the current setup.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway：既然我们谈论到政党政治，就此而言，您指出，也许在某些经济政策上存在一些共识，但保守党和工党之间多年来一直存在反复。您如何才能围绕经济政策建立共识，尤其是在人们将我们当前环境描述为相对动荡，并且金边债券收益率居高不下的时期？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Since we're talking political parties and on this note, you know, there maybe there is some consensus on specific economic policies as you point out, but we've had this back and forth between conservatives and labor for many, many years now. How do you actually go about building consensus around economic policy especially at a time when you know people would describe our current environment as relatively turbulent and guilt yields are where they are.</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：我想说，目前工党和保守党之间存在一种糟糕的经济共识，那就是除了我和少数几个人之外，没有人说机构需要改变。保守党也把自己包裹在“我们需要尊重独立的英格兰银行”的说法中。我们需要听取预算责任办公室的意见。他们不准备挑战经济建制派。工党也不准备。我们正处于这样一种境地：这些机构所信奉的政策正在失败，而且明显失败。

<p class="english-text">I would say there's a bad economic consensus between Labor and the Conservatives at present which is nobody is saying apart from me and a few others nobody is saying that the institutions need to change.

They're not prepared to take on the economic establishment. neither are the Labor Party and it we're in a situation where the policies these institutions believe in</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：金边债券利率现在比2022年高得多。失业率上升。我们的能源价格是世界上最高的，而且工业正在关闭。这些政策明显失败。然而，没有人挑战经济机构的根本原则。

</details>

### 言论自由与英国的“两级社会”

Joe Weisenthal：你知道，我很高兴您提到了言论自由，我也对此很感兴趣。当然，你知道，在西方，我认为言论自由和自由言论规范是好的，所以我担心当我看到它们在各个国家或朋友和邻居那里失败时。**巴勒斯坦行动**（Palestine Action: 一个激进的亲巴勒斯坦组织，以直接行动和破坏活动抗议对巴勒斯坦的压迫）似乎是一群脾气暴躁的老嬉皮士，我知道他们破坏了一架飞机，但他们被列为贵国的恐怖组织。人们甚至仅仅因为表示支持他们就会被捕。我认为他们基本上处于与**ISIS**（ISIS: 伊拉克和叙利亚伊斯兰国，一个被广泛认定为恐怖组织的极端武装团体）相同的恐怖组织级别，我认为大多数人会说，是的，那是一个真正的恐怖组织。那里到底发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, I'm glad you brought up free speech because I'm interested in that as well. And of course, you know, again, in the West, I think free speech, liberal speech norms are good and so I worry about when I see them failing in various countries or friends and neighbors. Palestine Action seems like a bunch of like crusty old hippies and I know they defaced a plane, but they're listed as a terrorist group in your country. People can get arrested even just for saying support them. And I think they're like a terrorist group basically like on the same level of as like ISIS, which I think most people say, yes, that is a genuine terrorist group. Like what is going on there?</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：嗯，他们确实袭击了一个军事基地，而且他们正在英国鼓吹恐怖主义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, they did attack a military base and they are advocating for terrorism in the UK.</p>

Joe Weisenthal：他们破坏了一架飞机，而且人们因为说支持他们而被捕或惹上麻烦。

<details>

Liz Truss：他们显然是一个有问题组织，而且英国有很多组织是被允许的，但在许多阿拉伯国家却不被允许。所以我认为我们打击这些组织是正确的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They are clearly a problematic organization and there are lots of organizations in Britain that are allowed in the UK that aren't actually allowed in many Arab countries. So I think it's right that we crack down on these organizations.</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：我确实认为，当人们，你知道，我是一个支持言论自由的人。我希望英国能有**第一修正案**（First Amendment: 美国宪法修正案，保障言论自由、新闻自由、宗教自由等基本权利）。我支持我同意和不同意的人拥有更多的言论自由。我们刚刚看到露西·康利获释出狱，她发了一条推文，四小时后删除了，却被判处31个月监禁，这简直是荒谬的。我认为我们已经成为国际笑柄。这是当局试图压制人们谈论的内容，而且基尔·斯塔默对此非常清楚。我认为这对一个社会来说是非常危险的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I do think when people, you know, I am a pro- free speech person. I'd love to have the First Amendment here in Britain. I support both people I agree with and people I don't agree with having a lot more free speech. And it is a travesty that we've just seen Lucy Connley released from jail who put out a tweet, deleted it four hours later and was sentenced to 31 months in prison. You know, that that is absolutely ludicrous. And I think we become an international laughingstock. And it is an attempt and K star was very clear about this. It is an attempt by the authorities to suppress what people are talking about. And I think that's a very dangerous thing for a society for a society to go down.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：所有这些事情都让我非常担忧，尤其是露西·康利的例子。她发了一条推文，我理解她删除了，但她发推文说要放火烧一家酒店。我的意思是，这可以说是一种煽动暴力行为。这会有什么不同？如果有人说“我们应该放火烧一座犹太教堂”，您会有同样的感受吗？那是言论自由吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All of these things really worry worry me in the Lucy Connelly example. So she she tweeted and I understand that she deleted it, but she tweeted about setting a hotel on fire. I mean that is arguably a call to violent action. Like how would that be different? Would you feel the same way if someone said like, you know, we should set a synagogue on fire? Is that free speech?</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：嗯，我认为她所说的话在美国不会被视为违法，因为我相信她不是在谈论一个具体的，“现在就出去做这件事”。那是一个笼统的声明。那显然是一件糟糕的事情，她也为此道歉了。我认为有一个问题是，在美国这是否构成犯罪。即使是犯罪，是否值得判处31个月的监禁，而我们却让那些被发现持有儿童色情制品的人免于牢狱之灾。我的意思是，你可能听说过“两级英国”的说法，但正在发生的是，人们因儿童强奸等罪行很早就被释放，却因他们在Twitter上写的东西而被关进监狱。在我看来，这是两个不同的类别。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think what she said would not have been deemed a violation in the US because it wasn't I don't believe she was talking about a specific, you know, go out and do this now. It was a general statement. It was obviously a terrible thing to say and she has said sorry for that. I think there's a question about whether or not in the US that would have even been a crime at all. And even if it is a crime, whether it merits a 31 month prison sentence when we have people caught with child pornography being let off with no jail time at all. I mean, you probably heard the expression two-tier Britain, but what is happening is people are being let out very early for crimes like child rape and yet put in prison for things that they write on Twitter. And those are two different categories in my opinion.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：您刚才提到了第一修正案。如果您再次掌权，您将如何改革英国的言论权利？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You mentioned the first amendment just then. How would you reform I guess speech rights in the UK if you were in power again?</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：我们在1695年就提出了言论自由、新闻自由，这是一项历史性的英国自由。我们当然有1689年的**权利法案**（Bill of Rights: 英国议会于1689年通过的法律，限制了君主的权力，保障了议会的权利和公民的自由），美国在此基础上建立了他们的权利法案等等。所以这些自由存在于英国宪法中。问题是自那时以来通过的所有法律，最值得注意的是**在线安全法案**（Online Safety Act: 英国政府旨在监管互联网内容以保护用户的法律）。我们需要做的是通过一项“大复兴法案”来恢复英国的历史自由，该法案将废除所有这些将国家束缚的立法。我谈到了，你知道，我们有问题的机构，司法机构的问题，言论自由的问题。这一切都归结于非常糟糕的立法，这些立法本质上将曾经属于英国公民个人或英国议会的权力交给了非民选的官僚。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you we came up with free speech, freedom of the press back in 1695 and it was a historic British liberty. We had the bill of rights of course 1689 which then the United States you know built on that with your bill of rights and so on. So these liberties are there in the British Constitution. The problem is all of the laws that have been passed since most notably the online safety act. What we need to do is restore Britain's historic liberties with a great restoration bill that sweeps away all of this legislation that is tied the country in knots. And I've talked about, you know, our problematic institutions, the problems with the judiciary, the problems with free speech. This is all down to very poor quality legislation that is essentially handed power that used to sit in the hands of the individual British citizen or the British Parliament. It's handed those power to unelected bureaucrats.</p>

Joe Weisenthal：好的。好的。好的。嗯，你知道，中国有数亿人口从事制造业。但是，是的，我同意您的观点。没那么小。但是脱欧是否损害了规模产能？因为在我看来，如果我们考虑的是，好的，以高效水平进行大规模生产，使其真正具有竞争力，而不是某种政府补贴的累赘，仅仅作为一项权宜之计的产业。在我看来，市场的纯粹规模非常重要，而脱欧似乎缩小了英国市场的规模。

<p class="english-text">Okay. Maybe it just feels like it over here because it feels like a lot of the rot you describe or what the rot that you perceive in your country almost so much of it seems to have taken place under conservative government. Why is that? And why would anyone you know and they're thinking about the next election. Why would anyone think that if there so much rot was allowed to happen under the Tories that the Tories should be given another chance in power?</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：所以，我认为腐朽是随着时间积累起来的。我谈到了永久官僚机构的发展。艾德礼政府将土地国有化，创建了NHS，创建了福利国家。我们的许多问题都可以追溯到那个政府。但布莱尔政府非常重要的一点是，它将议会手中的权力转移到非民选机构、官僚机构、英格兰银行、司法任命委员会以及现在决定言论自由的所有这些机构手中。这些未经选举的机构现在实际上管理着我们的国家。保守党犯的最大错误是没有逆转这一点。这是因为当时戴维·卡梅伦说他想成为布莱尔的继承人，你知道，他想变得时髦。保守党想变得现代化。但我认为这是一个巨大的错误，保守党失去了它的灵魂。这就是在追求权力、追求现代化的过程中发生的事情，保守党失去了它的灵魂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think the rot has sort of built up over time. So I talked about the development of the permanent bureaucracy. You had the Atly government which socialized land which created the NHS which created the welfare state. A lot of our problems go back to that government. But what was very important about the Blair government is this taking power that was in the hands of Parliament and putting it in the hands of unelected bodies, bureaucracies, the Bank of England, the Judicial Appointments Commission, all of this plethora of people offcom who are now making the decisions about free speech. These plethora of people have not been elected now de facto run our country. And the big mistake the Conservative party made was not reversing that. And this was because at the time David Cameron said he wanted to be the heir to Blair, you know, he wanted to be fashionable. The Conservatives wanted to be modern. But I think it was a huge error and the Conservative Party lost its soul. That's what happened in the pursuit of power, in the pursuit of trying to be modern. The Conservative Party lost its soul.</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：我认为保守党能否找回它的灵魂或被取代，这是一个悬而未决的问题。但当然，你知道，我们现在所处的位置，没有足够多的人说过去14年真正出了什么问题。但保守党未能对抗官僚机构。这些不是保守党的政策。它们只是我们没有反对的政策。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think it's an open question about whether or not the Conservative Party can get its soul back or be replaced. But certainly, you know, where we are now, not enough people are saying what really went wrong over those 14 years. But the Conservative Party failed to take on the bureaucracy. These were not the Conservative Party's policies. they were just policies that we didn't object to.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway：关于Joe的观点，当您回顾英国经济史上的某些时刻，例如脱欧，当时的论点是，如果我们摆脱所有这些欧盟法规，英国经济将能够自由繁荣。我认为在1970年代，安东尼·巴伯也实施了一些减税措施，就在通货膨胀达到25%左右之前。为什么英国民众应该相信以增长为重点的经济政策，即以大幅减税和放松管制为特征的政策，会真正推动经济增长？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Related to Joe's point, when you you think back to certain moments in Britain's economic history, so for instance, Brexit, the argument then was that if we get rid of all this EU regulation, the UK economy will be free to flourish and prosper. And I think in the 1970s, you know, Anthony Barber instituted some tax cuts as well, right before inflation hit, I think 25% or something like that. Why should the UK population have confidence that a growth focused economic policy, one that features, you know, big tax cuts and deregulation, will actually drive economic growth?</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：嗯，我认为关于脱欧需要注意的重要一点是，我们并没有废除任何那些欧洲法律。它们仍然在英国的法规中。所以，保护蝙蝠和蝾螈的法律仍然在法规中。告诉你你的开罐器应该如何工作的法律仍然在法规中。我们仍然有**工作时间指令**（working time directive: 欧盟法律，规定了工作时间、休息时间等劳动标准）。我们仍然有所有这些法律。所以，这又回到了你之前谈论保守党的问题。保守党在那些希望英国成为一个自由贸易、积极进取的国家（就像新加坡）的人和那些希望英国成为欧洲一部分、拥有大量劳动法保护人民、环境繁文缛节等的人之间存在根本性的分歧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think the important thing to note about about Brexit is we haven't got rid of any of those European laws. They're still on the British statute books. So, laws that protect bats and nutes still on the statute books. Laws that tell you how your can opener should work are still on the statute books. We still have the working time directive. It we still got all of those laws. So, this goes back to the problem you were talking about the Conservative Party. The Conservative Party is fundamentally split between people who want Britain to be, you know, Singapore on terms, you know, a free trading, you know, go getting country and people who want it to be part of Europe and want to be part of the, you know, European lots of labor laws protecting people, you know, environmental red tape, all of that stuff.</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：而这个问题在保守党内部从未解决，这就是为什么，你知道，你看到首相被罢免，为什么保守党内部存在争论。我认为如果你看看英国的脱欧投票，52%的人投票支持脱欧，48%的人反对。所以脱欧并没有按照公众的意图实现。我的意思是，最大的例子当然是移民问题，鲍里斯·约翰逊政府未能，事实上允许移民大幅增加，这产生了非常负面的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that issue was never resolved within the Conservative Party, which is why, you know, you saw prime ministers being deposed, why you have the debate within the Conservative Party. And I think if you look at the Brexit vote in Britain, 52% voted for Brexit, 48% didn't. So Brexit was not delivered as the public intended. I mean the biggest case in point is of course immigration where the Boris Johnson government failed to in fact allowed immigration to increase huge amounts which has had a very negative effect.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：你知道，既然您提到了英国的党派政治以及保守党内部的分裂，我在这里再问一个无知的问题。我确实觉得保守党内部似乎比工党成员之间更互相憎恨，还有**1922委员会**（1922 Committee: 英国保守党议会党团的委员会，对党的领导人有重要影响力），我仍然需要时不时地查维基百科才能记住那是什么。他们总是互相算计。保守党内部是否存在比工党更深层次的内部仇恨文化？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, since you mentioned party politics in the UK and the split within the Conservative Party, again, ignorant question here. I do get the impression that the Conservatives just like all seem to hate each other more than the members of the Labor Party and the 1922 committee, which I still like have to Wikipedia every once in a while to remember what that is. And they're always like scheming against each other. Is there like a deeper culture of just internal hate in the Conservative Party than the Labor Party?</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：我想说，保守党的问题可以追溯到玛格丽特·撒切尔被罢免的时候，以及保守党温和派和撒切尔主义者之间的分歧。但如果你将其与美国政治进行比较，你知道，如果你看看特朗普这样的人和迪克·切尼这样的人或布什共和党人之间的分歧，这是一个非常相似的意识形态分歧。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I would say I would say the problems of the Conservative party go back to where Margaret Thatcher was defenistrated and the sort of Tory wets and the you know the Thatcherites. But if you compare it to American politics you know if you look at the split between people like Trump and people like Dick Cheney or the sort of Bush Republicans it's a very similar ideological divide.</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：但美国的不同之处在于，特朗普基本上已经掌控了共和党，而在英国，保守党内的左翼仍然掌控着它。这就是区别。

### 振兴英国制造业与全球贸易

Joe Weisenthal：目前许多发达国家似乎正在发生的一件事是，每个人都希望提振自己的国内制造业。我相信您之前也谈到过英国对这方面的需求。当我想到英国经济时，我通常认为在所谓的知识型工作方面存在相当大的垄断。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, one of the things that seems to be happening in many developed countries at the moment is everyone wants to boost their own domestic manufacturing sector. And I believe you've spoken about the need for this in the UK before. When I think about the British economy, I usually think there's a pretty big monopoly when it comes to, let's call it, intellectual jobs,</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：服务业、金融业、办公室和新闻业。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">services, finance, office, and journalism. Yeah,</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：那种事情。但当我想到英国制造业时，你知道，它是一个岛国，人口相对较少，与世界上其他一些地方相比，而且税收很高，正如您一直指出的那样。在每个人似乎都在同一领域竞争的时候，是什么能让英国在制造业方面真正具有竞争力呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that kind of thing. But when I think about British manufacturing, you know, it's it's an island with a relatively small population compared to some other places in the world and high taxes, as you've been pointing out. What would make Britain actually competitive when it comes to manufacturing at a time when everyone seems out to uh compete in the same field?</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：嗯，最重要的就是能源价格需要下降。你知道，它们是世界上最高的。它们是美国的四倍。如果你是一家汽车制造商，一家钢铁制造商，就很难竞争。所以，这一点必须改变。我们必须让在英国建造东西变得容易得多。如果你想建造一个新工厂，需要太长时间。所以，所有这些供应侧政策都需要改变。我认为英国，我们比任何其他国家都更早地去工业化。你现在可以看到德国和欧洲大陆也正在发生同样的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, the number one thing is energy prices need to come down. You know, they're the highest in the world. They're four times the United States. If you are a car manufacturer, a steel manufacturer, it's incredibly hard to compete. So, that's that has to change. We have to make it much easier to build things in Britain. if you want to build a new factory, it takes far too long. So, there are all of those sort of supply side policies that need to change. I think Britain, we de-industrialized pretty much earlier than any other country. You can see the same thing now happening in Germany and continental Europe.</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：我认为尽一切可能维持制造业基础非常重要，因为许多行业，例如人工智能，需要高水平的能源。它需要其他可以从中“汲取养分”的行业。所以，如果你只是成为……我之前谈到了新加坡，但新加坡是一个相对较小的国家，所以它可以成为一个贸易枢纽。英国是一个拥有7000万人口的国家。我认为你不能仅仅依靠服务业。我认为你必须生产全方位的商品。我非常担心我们正在失去我们的最后一个炼钢高炉。是的。我们在新冠疫情期间学到的是，如果你依赖中国生产药品，你就会面临严重的困境。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's important to do all you can to maintain a manufacturing base because a lot of industries like AI for example requires high levels of energy. It requires other industries that it can sort of feed off if you like. So if you just become I I talked about Singapore and TESS earlier but Singapore is a relatively small country so it can afford to be a trading hub. Britain is a country of 70 million people. I think you can't rely on services alone. I think you have to produce the full gamut. I'm very worried that we're losing our last steel blast furnace. Yeah. What we learned during co is you are seriously up against it if you are relying on you know China for pharmaceuticals.</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：这些是英国可以擅长并且确实擅长的行业。我的意思是，我们对美国最大的制成品出口是汽车。我们确实生产人们想购买的优质高端汽车。所以英国制造业是有机会的。只是高能源价格和我们的规划规定使其变得非常非常困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">These are the types of industry that Britain can excel in and does excel in. I mean our biggest manufactured export to the United States is cars. We do produce good high-end cars that people want to buy. So there are opportunities for British manufacturing. It's just been made very very hard by high energy prices and our planning rules.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：我当然同意您关于能源价格和规划规则的观点。许多人在这里也有同样的讨论，在我看来，Tracy提到了相对较少的人口。规模极其重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I take your point about certainly about energy prices and planning rules. Many people are having the same discussions here to my mind and Tracy mentioned the fairly small population. Scale is incredibly important.</p>

Tracy Alloway：仍然那么小。我的意思是1700万。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Still that small. I mean 17 million.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：好的。好的。好的。嗯，你知道，中国仅制造业就有数亿人口。但是，是的，我同意您的观点。没那么小。但是脱欧是否损害了规模产能？因为在我看来，如果我们考虑的是，好的，以高效水平进行大规模生产，使其真正具有竞争力，而不是某种政府补贴的累赘，仅仅作为一项权宜之计的产业。在我看来，市场的纯粹规模非常重要，而脱欧似乎缩小了英国市场的规模。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Okay. Okay. Well, you know, China has however hundreds of millions just in the manufacturing. But yes, I take your point. Not that small. But did Brexit harm scale capacity?

It strikes me that sheer scale of market is very important and it feels to me like Brexit has shrunk the scale of that market for the</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：我的意思是，没有证据表明脱欧后对欧洲的出口下降了。事实上，你知道，我们从欧盟获得的不同贸易协议为英国带来了一些机会，因为我们在某些领域对美国的关税低于欧盟。但我认为制造业的另一个重要因素是，它正在变得越来越自动化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, there's no there's no evidence that exports to Europe have gone down after Brexit. And in fact, you know, the different trade deal we got from the EU presents the UK with some opportunities because we have lower tariffs in some areas with the United States than the EU does. But I think the other big factor in manufacturing is so much of it is becoming automated</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：这使得商品在靠近市场的地方生产具有经济意义，因为你不再获得巨大的劳动力成本差异优势。所以，我认为这只是现代经济的自然发展进程，当你的自动化程度更高时，更多的制造业将在离家更近的地方完成。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that it makes economic sense for goods to be produced close to market because you're no longer getting the advantage of a massive labor cost differential. So, I think it's it's just a natural progression of modern economies that more manufacturing is going to be done closer to home when you've got a much more automated process.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway：既然我们谈论贸易和出口，英国是第一个与特朗普政府签署关税协议的国家之一。您会那么快签署吗？或者您会稍微多一些抵制吗？考虑到您强调在国内提振制造业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Since we're talking trade and exports, uh the UK was one of the first countries, I think, to sign an agreement with the Trump administration on tariffs. Would you have signed that so quickly or would you have perhaps uh pushed back a little bit more given, you know, your emphasis on boosting manufacturing domestically within the UK?</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：我当时确实赞扬了基尔·斯塔默的这项协议。我是少数几个赞扬它的人之一，我说这是因为我有与第一届特朗普政府的鲍勃·莱特希泽谈判的经验。所以我知道这有多困难，我认为英国获得了一项好协议，事实也证明欧盟获得的协议比英国获得的更糟。所以我认为他是对的。他这样做是对的。

<p class="english-text">I did actually praise Kier Stalmer for the deal at the time.

So I know how difficult it is and I thought the UK got a good deal and so it has proven that the EU is actually got a worse deal than the UK got. So I thought he was right. He was right to do that.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：为什么会这样？我想看看……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why is that? And I want to see</p>

Liz Truss：嗯，我们支付的关税低于欧盟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well we are paying lower tariffs than the EU is.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：所以只是相对而言，与其他国家相比，在绝对基础上您仍然在支付关税。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So just on a relative basis compared to others on an absolute basis you're still paying tariffs.</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：是的。但特朗普通过他与世界各地的所有贸易协议所做的，实质上是重塑了**世界贸易组织**（World Trade Organization, WTO: 旨在促进国际贸易自由化的国际组织）。我认为这是美国外交政策中最大的错误之一，当时克林顿允许中国以发展中国家条款加入世界贸易组织，这在我看来，帮助提振了中国经济。中国是一个专制威权政权。我认为那是一项灾难性的政策。特朗普正在努力做的是重置这一点。这不可避免地对美国的所有贸易伙伴产生了影响。但根据我对特朗普政府的了解，我认为基尔·斯塔默达成的协议是一项好协议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. But what Trump has done with the with all of his trade deals around the world is essentially reset the World Trade Organization. I think it was one of the biggest errors that of American for foreign policy when Clinton allowed China to join the World Trade Organization on developing country terms and that has had a in my view a it's helped boost China's economy. China is an autocratic authoritarian regime. I think that was a a disastrous policy. What Trump is trying to do is reset that. And that has inevitable consequences for all of America's trading partners. But knowing what I do about the Trump administration, I thought the deal Kiss Armor got was a good deal.</p>

Joe Weisenthal：可能有一件事可以……

<p class="english-text">Potentially one thing that could um</p>

<p class="english-text">and I don't praise him very often, by the way. I figured praise him.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：我想那很少见。嗯，理论上可以做的一件事是解决乌克兰战争，以降低许多地方的能源价格。我很好奇，当您审视特朗普的追求或基尔·斯塔默的言论时，您是否看到了其他途径？如果您现在是首相，您会在那场特定冲突中推动什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I figured that's rare. Um, one thing that theoretically could be done to lower energy prices for in many places would be a resolution of the war in Ukraine. And I'm curious what when you look at either Trump's pursuits or what Kirst has said, do you see other paths? Were you the prime minister now, what would you be pushing for in that particular conflict?</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：嗯，我希望那场冲突的结果是普京不会因为他对乌克兰的骇人入侵而得到奖励。所以我们不希望他，或者习近平，从乌克兰冲突的解决中得到这样的信号，即这次入侵在某种程度上是正当的或值得的。我希望俄罗斯被遏制，因为我仍然相信他们有扩张主义的本能。

I want Russia to be contained because I still believe that they have expansionist instincts.</p>
</details>

### 能源政策、市场反应与预测的局限性

Tracy Alloway：回到迷你预算一秒钟，其中一个组成部分是政府支持以抵消更高的能源价格。这也是似乎吓坏市场的事情之一。这种想法是，英国政府将在财政上承担责任，以补偿当时以惊人速度上涨的天文数字般的能源价格。如果您要重来一次，您是否会考虑包含某种机制来限制成本，或者避免英国基本上是在某种程度上救助其民众的感觉？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just going back to the mini budget for a second, one of the components of that was government support to offset higher energy prices. And that was also one of the things that seemed to spook markets. This idea that the UK government would be fiscally on the hook to compensate for astronomical energy prices at the time that seemed to be expanding at an enormous rate. If you were going to do it all over again, would you have possibly included some sort of mechanism to maybe limit the cost or, you know, avoid the sense that the UK was basically bailing out its population in some way?</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：重要的是要注意，能源方案是唯一没有被逆转的政策。所以，那不是政策。我被迫逆转的政策，现在对我来说已经很清楚了，是通过威胁，是公司税的增加。能源政策仍然存在。能源政策仍然存在。关于能源政策的重点是，它不是自动发生的补贴。只有当能源价格达到一定水平时才会发生。我相信政府这样做是正确的，因为政府未能确保提供足够便宜的能源。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's important to note that the energy package was one thing that wasn't reversed. So, that was not the policy. The policy that I was forced to res reversed now was made pretty clear to me pretty much you know through threats was the corporation tax increase. The energy policy remained in place. The energy policy remained in place. And the point about the energy policy was it was not a subsidy that happened automatically. It was only when energy prices reached a certain level. And I believed it was right for the government to do that because the government had failed to ensure adequately cheap energy was supplied.</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：但我当时与这项政策并行做的事情，即基本上确保人们免受高能源价格的影响，是继续进行**水力压裂**，许可新的北海天然气储备，这样价格就不会那么高。所以这是一种对价格上涨的保险，让消费者和企业有信心投资，同时我们解决了之前政府严重失败的供应问题。这就是这项政策的意图。正如我所说，这项政策没有被我的继任者逆转。被逆转的政策是继续进行水力压裂。所以你有了能源保险政策，但没有水力压裂政策。这些政策是协同设计的，这样我们就可以确保国内企业不会被高能源价格的威胁吓到。顺便说一句，如果能源价格真的那么高，无论如何都必须有某种方案来应对。我当时所做的是提前通知人们，这样他们就有信心投资。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But what I was doing in tandem with that policy of essentially ensuring people against very high energy prices was getting on with fracking, licensing new North Sea gas reserves so the prices would never get that high. So it was an insurance against prices going high to give consumers and businesses confidence to invest whilst we sorted out the supply that had been so badly failed by previous governments. That was the intention of the policy. And as I've said, the policy wasn't reversed by my successor. The policy that was reversed was getting on with the fracking. So you had the energy insurance policy, but not the fracking policy. Those policies were designed in tandem so that we can make sure that businesses in the country weren't spooked by the threats of having skyhigh energy prices. And by the way, if the energy prices had got that high, there would have had to be some kind of package to deal with them. Anyway, what I was doing is giving people notice so they had the confidence to invest.</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：能源方案实际上是在女王陛下非常不幸地去世之前几周宣布的。它不是在迷你预算时宣布的。经济建制派在迷你预算中真正反对的是税收。他们不喜欢的是不提高公司税。

<details>

It wasn't announced at the time of the mini budget. The thing that the the economic establishment really objected to in the mini budget was the taxes. It was the you know, it was not raising corporation tax. That's what they didn't like.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：我只有一个最后的问题。你知道，Tracy和我在公共领域工作，尽管不像担任英国首相那样公开。我们生活在一个故事疯狂传播，人们喜欢看到某人被公开羞辱的时代。在我看来，尤其是英国媒体，简直是一群豺狼。但这只是我在这里的印象，即使相对于这里的媒体。

I'm afraid they don't now. friends of mine who are journalists just say their editorial conferences about how many clicks their article gets and it's, you know, I just think that's pathetic.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：嗯，这些是现代记者面临的张力。但我还有一个问题。只是回到经济政策的一些技术方面。您批评了OBR的预测，这些预测最终影响甚至可能决定政府政策。我想我的问题是，你知道，当你考虑一个促增长的经济议程时，它也依赖于对未来增长的预测。当我们今年早些时候与特朗普政府的史蒂文·迈伦交谈时，我们谈话的一个收获是，特朗普政府多么依赖经济增长的提速来抵消它正在做的一些事情。

<p class="english-text">Well, these are the tensions of being a journalist in modern times. But I have one more question. It's just going back to um some technical aspects, I guess, of economic policy. So you've criticized the OBR for you know its forecasts that end up influencing or you know perhaps even dictating government policy. I guess my question is, you know, when you think about a progrowth economic agenda, that also relies on forecasts about future growth. And when we talked to uh Steven Myron from the Trump administration earlier this year, that was one takeaway from our conversation was how much the Trump administration was really betting on economic growth picking up in order to offset some of the stuff it was doing.</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：这是唯一的策略。这是唯一的策略。但为什么人们应该对增长预测有信心，却对OBR的预测没有信心呢？但关于OBR的重点，历史已经证明，他们高估了增税能带来多少收入，因为他们没有充分考虑经济活动的压抑，他们低估了规划或水力压裂等供应侧改革的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's the only strategy. It is the only strategy. But why should people have confidence in the growth forecast but not have confidence in you know OBR forecasts? But the point about the OBR, and this has been proven by history, is that they overestimate how much raising taxes will bring in in revenue because they don't take a full the full account of the depression in economic activity and they underestimate the impact of supply side reforms like planning or fracking or whatever else.</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：你知道，对此有两个答案。一是，有更好的经济学家。我认为政府，就像2010年之前的情况一样，政府应该有能力雇佣他们认为正确的经济学家。你知道，我不认为我的作业应该由一个不同意我观点的人来批改，而这正是当时发生的事情。我认为这根本是错误的。如果人们不喜欢我所说的，不喜欢这些政策，他们可以在选举中把我选下去。但我甚至不被允许尝试这些政策，因为批改我作业的人说不行。我的意思是，这就是底线。但第二点是，我认为我们过于依赖预测。你无法预测未来。试图说，就像英国体系所做的那样，五年后我们确切知道债务会是多少，这是胡说八道。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And you know, there are two answers to this. One is there are better economists out there and I think the government as was the case prior to 2010 the government should have the ability to hire the economists that you know they believe are right you know I don't think my homework should be marked by somebody who doesn't agree with me which was what was happening I think that's just wrong if people don't like what I'm saying and they don't like the policies they can vote me out at an election But I wasn't even allowed to try the policies because the people marking my homework said no. I mean, that's the bottom line.</p>
</details>

Liz Truss：你知道，我们不知道如果唐纳德·特朗普征收巨额关税会怎样。如果英国与印度达成贸易协议会怎样？你知道，如果发现一项彻底改变的新技术会怎样？你不知道未来会是什么样子。我的经济学是基于第一性原理的。我知道如果你把税收提得太高，人们就不会再去工作了。我知道如果你降低能源价格，企业更有可能在英国投资。这些预测的问题，这也是对英国经济媒体的另一个批评，预测的问题在于人们过于关注预测中的数字是否正确，而不是关注成功经济体的基本原则。

<details>

<p class="english-text">But the second thing is I think we're far too reliant on forecasts. You can't predict the future. And trying to say, which is what the UK system does, that five years out we know exactly what the debt is going to be is rubbish. You know, we don't know what if Donald Trump imposes huge tariffs. What if the UK strikes a trade deal with India? You know, what if there's a discovery of a new technology that totally transform? You don't know what the future's going to look like. And my economics is based on first principles. I know that if you put up taxes too high, people won't go out to work anymore. I know that if you make energy prices cheaper, businesses are more likely to invest in Britain. The problem with these forecasts, and this is another criticism of British economic media, the problem with forecasts is that people become focused on whether the numbers right in the forecast rather than the fundamental principles of what makes a successful economy.</p>

<p class="english-text">Tracy, I'm so glad we finally got to interview Liz Trust.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway：我们终于做到了。我认为现在是做这件事的好时机，因为目前特朗普政府和特拉斯在2022年经历的事情有很多重叠之处。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We finally did it. I think it was a good time to do it actually because there's, you know, there's a lot of overlap with the Trump administration at the moment and what Truss experienced in 2022.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：是的。是的。不，我的意思是，我发现有很多有趣的地方。你知道，我认为实际上对我来说最有趣的事情是，考虑到在美国我们有多个政府分支，对吧，所以总统想要什么，但国会会否决它，或者可以否决它，特别是如果执政党不同的话，显然这与英国的议会制度不同，然而即使在议会制度中，听到特拉斯描述的事实是，她所说的即使是对福利增长率的适度削减，她的党内成员也无法接受，更不用说反对党了，当然反对党永远不会投票支持，但在她自己的党内，我发现这是一个非常引人注目的评论，关于民选民主国家在削减开支方面所面临的困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. No, I mean there was a lot that I found to be interesting there. You know what I think actually maybe the most interesting thing to me is thinking that okay in the US we have these multiple branches of government right so the president wants something but congress is going to veto it or can veto it especially if it's a different party in power obviously that's not the dynamic of the UK with a parliamentary system and yet even in the parliamentary system to hear this trust describe the fact that what she describes as even modest cuts to the increase in welfare weren't palatable to the members of her party let alone the opposition which of course is never going to vote for but in her party I find that to be a very striking comment about the difficulty that you know electoral democracies have in reigning back cuts.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway：哦，绝对是。另一件引起我注意的事情是，当我们谈论关税时，莉兹说她赞扬了英国与特朗普政府达成的协议，因为它低于欧盟支付的关税。这对我来说很有趣，因为国家似乎在互相竞争。你知道，特朗普政府在某些方面是成功的，它让贸易伙伴互相竞争，以获得最低的协议，而不是在绝对基础上竞争更低的关税。我认为这很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh absolutely. The other thing that kind of caught my eye or my ear was when we were talking about tariffs and you know uh Liz said that she had praised um the deal that the UK struck with the Trump administration because it was less than what the EU was paying. And it's interesting to me that like countries seem to be competing with each other. You know, the Trump administration in some respects has been kind of successful in that getting its trade partners to compete with each other for the lowest deal rather than to, you know, try to compete on an absolute basis for lower tariffs per se. I thought that was interesting.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway：我还认为这很有趣，你知道，我对OBR或美国OM等实体的这种反民主方面深感同情，以及他们对政策运作方式的一套假设，以及他们拥有正式角色的想法，你知道，我认为这些机构存在某种不民主的成分，它们不一定拥有正式的否决权等等，而且它们不是民选的。我同情这种观点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I also think it's uh interesting you know this sort of I find myself having a lot of sympathy with this this sort of like anti-democratic aspects of entities like the OBR or in the US the OM and these idea that okay they have one set of assumptions about how policy works and the idea that like they have a formal role and you know there's there is a certain undemocratic element I think of these sort of institutions that either they not necessarily with a formal veto, etc. that aren't elected. I have sympathy for that opinion.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：这当然似乎可以作为对政府的体制制约，但有些人可能会认为这也许是件好事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It certainly seems like they can act as an institutional restraint on the government, but some people would argue that maybe that's a good thing.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway：不，对。就像今天，一个独立的机构审视经济政策和货币政策，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, right. Like today, an independent body looking at economic policy and monetary policy, right?</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal：是的。我的意思是，这就是问题所在。而且，非常引人注目的是，她说她真的不接受英格兰银行应该像现在这样独立的说法。而且，你知道，正如您所问的，将其重新纳入财政部的想法非常引人注目。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean, that's the thing. And look, it's very striking that she said really she does not accept the premise that the Bank of England should be as independent as it currently is. and that you know the idea as you to your question folding it back in with the treasury is very striking.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway：嗯，还有那句“不想让不相信它的人批改我的作业”。我相信我们所有学生都希望选择一个相信我们作业的老师来评分，但出于显而易见的原因，我们不能。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Well, also the line about you know not wanting to have her homework marked by someone who doesn't believe in it. I'm sure all of us as students would have liked to choose our own teacher who was grading our homework, but we don't get to for obvious reasons.</p>
