title: AI泡沫何时破裂？—— 深度解析资本主义与全球经济趋势
---

### 资本主义的现状与政府角色的演变

大家好，欢迎来到这次访谈。今天我们有幸邀请到一位特别的嘉宾—— रुचिर·夏尔马（Ruchir Sharma）。他是一位深刻的思想家，我们去年曾就他的著作《资本主义出了什么问题？》（What Went Wrong With Capitalism）进行过深入交流。

<p class="english-text">Hi everybody and welcome to this conversation with a very special person, Ruchir Sharma, and this looks like a fake background but it is real. They often use it with green screen. Yes, it is very beautiful. Now you are a very deep and wonderful thinker. And we met last year and talked about your book, What Went Wrong With Capitalism.</p>
</details>

又过了一年，世界发生了多少变化！那么，您认为在过去的12个月里，资本主义经历了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. Now another year has passed and wow how the world has changed. So what is your take that uh what has happened with capitalism in the last 12 months?</p>
</details>

总的来说，我认为这有点令人沮丧。因为到处似乎政府的角色都在增加。即使在我们美国这里，也有了新政府。然而，我认为那种“政府只需做好必要工作然后退居幕后”的旧观念，现在已经从根本上动摇了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well I think it's a bit disappointing. Isn't it? Because everywhere it seems the role of government is increasing. We have a new government here in the US as well. Yet I think that old thinking that the government should just do the necessary and get out of the way. That thinking has now fundamentally been shaken everywhere.</p>
</details>

当然，现任政府在去监管化（De-regulation: 减少政府对经济活动的干预和管制）方面做了很多工作，我认为这非常积极。但仍然存在一种观念，即在有人陷入困境时，政府应该在那里提供帮助。而且，联邦储备系统（Federal Reserve: 美国中央银行，负责制定货币政策和监管银行）似乎也总是在出现问题时倾向于降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now obviously the current government is doing a lot of work on de-regulation which I think is very positive. But still the thinking is that you should be there when someone is in trouble to help. And the Federal Reserve also wants to cut interest rates as soon as any problem is seen.</p>
</details>

我认为，正如我在书中多次遗憾地写到的那样，不平等现象依然存在：当有利润时，你可以从资本主义中获利；而另一方面，风险却是社会化的。我认为这种不对称性仍然存在于系统中，这让我感到担忧。但在那之前，您认为在过去12个月里，我们应该提及关于事件的哪些其他方面？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In my opinion, this is the inequality which I have written about many times with regret in my book, that when there are profits, you can profit from capitalism. On the other hand, the risks are socialized. I think that asymmetry still exists in the system and that's what worries me.</p>
</details>

### AI：全球经济的新焦点与潜在泡沫

看，人们总是关注特朗普。但我觉得，在过去的12个月里，有一件事变得比特朗普更重要，那就是人工智能（AI - Artificial Intelligence: 核心驱动技术，影响经济增长与市场估值）。它现在已经成为全球经济，特别是美国经济的焦点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But before that, what do you think are the other things we should mention about the events of the last 12 months? Look, everyone was after Trump. But I think in the last 12 months, there is one thing that has become bigger than Trump, and that is AI.</p>
</details>

美国经济现在押注于人工智能，因为除了AI之外，美国经济本身存在很多疲软。但AI正在不断推动一切向前发展。因此，美国在AI上投入如此巨大的赌注，其成功至关重要。否则，国家未来可能会面临困难。目前，一切似乎都围绕着AI展开。这是最主要的因素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It has now become a singular focus of the global economy and especially the US economy. The US economy is now a big bet on AI, because outside of AI, the US economy has a lot of weakness. But AI is constantly pushing everything forward. Therefore, the success of the huge bet that America has placed on AI is crucial. Otherwise, there could be difficulties for the country going forward.</p>
</details>

当您审视AI在社会和股市中的重要性时，您关注哪些方面？这里有几点。我认为其中一点是AI对经济增长的巨大影响。目前的数据显示，今年美国约40%的经济增长来自于AI相关的资本支出（CapEx - Capital Expenditure: 企业为购买、维护或升级固定资产（如厂房、设备）而进行的支出）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For now, everything revolves around AI. That is the biggest factor that has emerged. When you look at the importance of AI in society and the stock market, what things do you focus on? Here are a few things. Isn't it?</p>
</details>

我认为另一个影响同样重要但被低估了，那就是财富效应（Wealth Effect: 指资产价格上涨导致消费者财富增加，进而刺激消费支出的现象）。股市表现良好，金融资产表现良好。这显然增加了这个国家前10%人口的支出，而前10%的人口正是这个国家消费支出的主要驱动力。因此，股市今年约80%的涨幅来自于AI概念股。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think one of them is how much AI is already impacting economic growth. So current methods show that about 40% of economic growth in America this year has come from CapEx spending on AI. So that's one way. The second impact, I think, is also something that is important but underestimated. It's the wealth effect, meaning the stock market is doing well.</p>
</details>

所以，可以说，今天美国约60%的经济增长来自于AI。现在的问题是，这是否也存在泡沫的经典信号？作为金融历史学家，我们正在研究。但我们先不谈泡沫。美国60%的增长来自AI。但我们认为，这是否会反映在这些公司的股价上？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Financial assets are doing well. This is clearly increasing the spending of the top 10% of people in this country, and the top 10% of people are driving the entire consumer spending in this country. So the stock market's rally of about 80% this year has come from AI plays. So in a way, you can say that about 60% of economic growth in America today is coming from AI.</p>
</details>

AI的实际应用带来了什么经济效益？目前还没有。因为AI的普及仍处于早期阶段。因此，在过去两三年里，我们才在美国经济中看到生产力有所提高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now the problem with this is that there are also classic signs of a bubble. As financial historians, we are studying. But let's not talk about the bubble yet. So 60% growth in the US is coming from AI. But do we think its impact will be seen in the share prices of these companies? Isn't it?</p>
</details>

您认为这有多少是来自AI？我认为现在还太早了，贡献非常小。什么时候？您认为什么时候会看到？应该在未来两三年内。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. Now what economic benefits are you seeing from the implementation of AI? Well, not yet. Because the adoption of AI is still in its early stages. That's why we have seen some increase in productivity in the American economy over the last two or three years.</p>
</details>

因为如果看看互联网革命，它发生在20世纪90年代末，生产力的巨大飞跃就出现在那个时期，并且一直持续到21世纪初的衰退之后。也就是说，这些好处需要时间才能显现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What do you think? How much is coming from this? AI? I think it's too early yet. So it's very little right now. By when? By when do you think we will see this? It should happen in the next two to three years. Isn't it?</p>
</details>

而且，我们甚至还不知道AI最终会做什么。所以希望仍然很大。我们都在某种程度上开始使用AI，但我们不确定生产力是否会提高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because if you look at the internet revolution, which happened in the late 1990s, the big jump in productivity came at that time and continued even after the recession of the early 2000s. That is, these benefits take time to show.</p>
</details>

与以往大型科技革命的AI普及相比，有一个关键区别。坦白说，这是最令人讨厌的科技革命。这意味着，如果回顾过去，其他大型革命，甚至那些泡沫，如果以著名的类比来看，就像90年代末的互联网泡沫。所有调查都显示，90年代中期和末期，人们对互联网能为他们做什么感到非常乐观。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we don't even know yet what AI is ultimately going to do. So the hope is still very big. We have all started using AI in some form or another. But we are not sure if productivity will increase or not. And there is a very important difference in the adoption of this AI compared to the big tech revolutions that happened before. Frankly, this is the most hated tech revolution.</p>
</details>

今天的调查显示，大多数人对AI持相当负面的看法。原因有两个。首先，所有技术乐观主义者都在告诉我们，他们将夺走我们的工作，因为AI的主要好处将是降低劳动力成本。其次，人们担心我们会如何使用AI。每个人都在说AI已经来了，如果你不使用AI，你可能会失去工作，人们对此感到恐惧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what that means is, if you look back, the other big revolutions, even the bubbles that formed, if we talk about the famous parallel, which was in the late 1990s. All surveys show that in the mid-90s and late-90s, people were very optimistic about what the internet could do for them. There was a lot of hope.</p>
</details>

事实上，我看到的一些调查显示，只有35%的人对AI感觉良好。事实上，大多数人希望以某种方式对其进行监管，因为他们害怕AI的影响。所以，如果你看看过去的狂热泡沫，或者过去的重大革命，人们通常对它们将带来什么感到非常乐观。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Today, surveys show that most people are quite negative about AI. And there are two reasons for this. First, all the techno-optimists are telling them that we will take your jobs because the big benefit of AI will be reduced labor costs. And second, there is a fear of what we will do with this AI.</p>
</details>

比如电力、汽车，或者像日本那样，在80年代末充满信心。中国在十年前也是如此。但AI的重大区别在于，人们似乎真的害怕它会对自己做什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Everyone is saying that AI has arrived and if you don't use AI, you might lose your job, and people are afraid of it. So in fact, some surveys I've seen indicate that only 35% of people feel good about AI. In fact, most people want it to be regulated in some way because they fear the impact of AI.</p>
</details>

是的。也许很多人都害怕。我非常喜欢它。是的，我们在公司里非常积极地拥抱它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if you look at the past mania bubbles or the past big revolutions, people are generally very optimistic about what it's going to bring. Isn't it? Electricity, cars, or places like Japan, where there was a lot of confidence in the late 80s. China a decade ago, and so on. But the big difference with AI is that people genuinely fear what it will do to them.</p>
</details>

是的，但这是否也在导致失业？也许这对您来说是件大事。我们确保没有人失业。但它极大地增加了我们的工作量、工作难度和工作质量。我们能用同样的人员完成所有这些工作吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. Well, maybe many people are afraid. I like it very much. Yes, and we are embracing it very well in our company.</p>
</details>

但我能理解你的意思。那么，这是泡沫吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, but is it also causing job losses? Maybe that's a big deal for you. We ensure that no jobs are lost. But it greatly increases our workload, the difficulty of our work, and the quality of our work.</p>
</details>

### 泡沫的四重奏：过度投资、高估值与过度集中

我认为，如果你看看我称之为指导我们是否有泡沫的四种“O”因素，那么这四种“O”是什么呢？一种是过度投资（Over-investment）。如果你看看今天的AI投资，按GDP计算的科技投资水平，与我们过去泡沫时期，特别是2000年时看到的水平大致相同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I can understand what you're saying. So is this a bubble?</p>
</details>

今天，科技投资仍接近5%左右，与当时大致相同。所以，在某些方面，我们也看到了过度投资。泡沫的第二个典型迹象是过度估值（Overvaluation）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So is this a bubble? But I think if you look at the four types of 'Os' that guide you on whether we have a bubble or not. So what are these four 'Os' for me? One 'O' is over-investment. If you look at the investment happening in AI today, the tech investment as a percentage of GDP is roughly at the same level as we saw in past bubbles, especially in 2000.</p>
</details>

无论从哪个角度看，美国股市，尤其是AI相关股票，都已过度估值。有些人认为估值不像2000年那么高。是的，在某些指标上，比如市盈率（PE ratio），这是正确的。但如果你看市价自由现金流（Price to Free Cash Flow）或长期收益，这些指标显示我们正接近同一水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Today, tech investment is still around 5%, which is roughly the same as at that time. So, in some ways, we are also seeing over-investment. The second typical sign of a bubble is overvaluation. No matter from which angle you look, US stock markets, especially AI-related stocks, are overvalued.</p>
</details>

所以，这一点也说得通。第三个原因是人们过度集中于某件事。也就是说，所有相同的交易和想法。在美国，一个简单的衡量方法是，如今美国人的金融财富中，约有52%是股权，这比2000年还要高。而且人们像疯了一样交易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some people believe that valuations are not as high as in 2000. Yes, on some metrics, like PE ratio, this is correct. But if you look at price to free cash flow or long-term earnings, these metrics show we are approaching the same level. So this point also holds true.</p>
</details>

第四个原因是经常与过度杠杆（Over-leverage）相关，即整个系统中的杠杆水平过高。在这方面，证据有些混合。因为那些构建AI的公司，到目前为止，拥有相当多的现金。你知道，这些公司产生了很高的自由现金流。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The third reason is that people over-concentrate on something. That is, all the same trades and ideas. A simple way to measure this in America is that today, about 52% of Americans' financial wealth is in equities, which is higher than in 2000. And people are trading like crazy.</p>
</details>

但这种情况正在迅速改变。在过去几个月里，最大的债务发行者一直是Meta和Amazon等公司。所以它们正在迅速开始借贷，因为AI军备竞赛确实在加速。每个人都想保持领先地位，并认为最大的风险是，如果我们不能在AI领域领先，会怎么样？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The fourth reason is often related to over-leverage, meaning the leverage level in the entire system becomes too high. In this regard, the evidence is somewhat mixed. Because the companies building AI have had considerable cash until now. You know, these companies were generating high free cash flow.</p>
</details>

### 全球经济版图：美国、欧洲与中国的挑战与机遇

是的，我认为苏珊·皮查伊（Sundar Pichai）去年的声明是：“对我们来说，最大的风险不是投资过多，而是投资过少。”所以，我认为现在普遍的看法是，在AI上投资不足。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, I think Sundar Pichai's statement last year was: "For us, the biggest risk is not investing too much, but investing too little." So, I think the prevailing sentiment now is under-investing in AI.</p>
</details>

我注意到的一个有趣的区别是，20世纪90年代的科技投资周期是逐渐增长的。它从90年代初开始形成，然后逐渐增长。而这次看到的则是投资周期中最快的积累。两年前，AI和科技资本支出对GDP增长的贡献几乎为零，现在却贡献了约40%。这是一个巨大的积累，而且速度非常快。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And one interesting difference I've noticed is that the tech investment cycle in the 1990s grew gradually. It started forming from the early 90s and then grew. What is seen this time is the fastest build-up in the investment cycle. Two years ago, AI and tech CapEx contributed almost nothing to GDP growth, and now they contribute about 40%. This is a huge build-up, and it's happening very fast.</p>
</details>

当然，有些人会说，这次AI的普及速度也比以往更快。但投资的增长以及有多少资金是通过债务融资的，这些都在迅速变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Of course, some will say that the adoption of AI this time is also faster than before. But the increase in investment and how much money is being financed through debt, all these are changing rapidly.</p>
</details>

但这真的重要吗？我的意思是，现在很多人区分“好泡沫”和“坏泡沫”。他们说这是一个好泡沫，因为它将资本重新分配到能够提高社会生产力的领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But does that really matter? I mean, many people now differentiate between "good bubbles" and "bad bubbles." They say this is a good bubble because it reallocates capital to areas that will enhance society's productivity.</p>
</details>

是的，我认为这是正确的。大多数科技泡沫都是好泡沫，因为最终留下的东西可以让每个人受益。而坏泡沫则是房地产泡沫之类的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, I think that's correct. Most tech bubbles are good bubbles because what is left in the end is something that everyone can benefit from. And bad bubbles are things like real estate bubbles.</p>
</details>

那么，这是好是坏？在这个案例中，这是一个好泡沫。也就是说，它承诺在生产力和技术方面取得重大进步。所以，我认为从这个意义上说，这是一个好泡沫。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, is it good or bad? In this case, it's a good bubble. That is, it promises significant advances in productivity and technology. So, I think in that sense, it's a good bubble.</p>
</details>

我们回到您最初提到的观点：政府正在形成。你知道，官僚机构和国家等等。这是真的吗？我的意思是，我们是否正在看到，如果我们从美国开始，在美国，您是否认为官僚机构正在形成？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We return to the point you mentioned at the beginning. That is, governments are forming. You know, bureaucracy and the state, etc. Is this true? I mean, are we seeing, if we start from the US, in the US, do you think bureaucracy is forming?</p>
</details>

嗯，我认为在去监管化和其他方面确实有所放缓。但现在改变的是，美国政府直接入股公司的想法已经改变。这似乎是国家干预经济的一种更高级的形式。我的观点一直是，国家日益增长的干预削弱了生产力增长，破坏了活力，并加剧了不平等，因为它总是使既得利益者和建制派受益。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think there has been some slowdown in de-regulation and other aspects. But what has changed now is that the idea of the US government taking direct stakes in companies has changed. This seems to be a more advanced form of state intervention in the economy. My point has always been that the state's growing intervention has weakened productivity growth, undermined dynamism, and exacerbated inequality, as it always benefits the entrenched groups and the establishment.</p>
</details>

而且我认为，这个过程在任何重大层面上都没有逆转的迹象。所以，是的，有一些积极的迹象，比如去监管化和正在发生的事情。但另一方面，我认为，美国政府希望与所有科技巨头以及其他各方保持良好关系，因为他们不知道未来会发生什么，这似乎是他们的一种策略。所以，我认为这是一个你可以清楚看到政府作用增强的领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I don't think there are any signs of this process reversing on any major level. So, yes, there are some positive signs, like de-regulation and things that are happening. But on the other hand, I think the idea that the US government wants to maintain good relations with all tech giants and everyone else, because they don't know what will happen in the future, seems to be a strategy.</p>
</details>

我实际上来自印度。告诉我，有一件事我一直很喜欢，那就是印度和美国之间的区别。其中一点是，在印度，任何做生意的人都不会对政府说任何负面的话，至少在任何公开场合都不会，因为他们害怕，即使这是民主，如果你说政府的坏话，政府可能会利用其监管权力来对付你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I think this is an area where you can clearly see the increased role of government. I am actually from India. Tell me, one thing I always liked was the difference between India and America. One point was that in India, anyone doing business would not say anything negative about the government, at least not publicly, because they fear that even if it is a democracy, if you speak ill of the government, the government might use its regulatory power against you.</p>
</details>

我在印度见过这种情况。我见了大约40位商业领袖。没有人对政府说一句负面的话。尤其是在公开场合，没有出路。即使是私下里，是的。所以，我认为情况就是这样。现在，在美国，我们总是为能够说任何想说的话而自豪。人们会公开地成为民主党人或共和党人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have seen this in India. I met about 40 business leaders. Not a single one said a negative word about the government. Especially not publicly, there is no way. Even privately, yes. So, I think that's how it is. Now, in America, we always pride ourselves on being able to say whatever we want.</p>
</details>

今天，如果你留意并看看这些与美国政府举行的会议，人们围坐在桌子旁。它们都变成了“谁更胜一筹”的表演，每个人都在告诉对方他们多么爱特朗普，多么爱政府。这是美国发生的一个巨大变化，而且几乎和我以前在印度看到的一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">People will openly be Democrats or Republicans. Today, if you pay attention and look at some of these meetings held with the American government, where people are sitting around the table. They have all become one-upmanship shows, where everyone is telling the other person how much they love Trump and how much they love the government.</p>
</details>

您如何理解这一点？这意味着什么？我的意思是，对政府的恐惧是，如果你对政府说一些非常负面的话，他们可能会找你麻烦。任何事情都可能发生。我认为这让你了解了这一点，不是吗？这个转变是如何发生的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is a huge change that has happened in America, and it's almost the same as what I used to see in India. How do you understand this? What does it mean? Well, the fear of the government is that if you say something very negative about the government, they might come after you. Anything can happen.</p>
</details>

政府的深度干预，您是否也以同样的方式看待关税？这是否也是其作用之一？是的。这是因为关税政策非常主观。它背后没有客观性或科学性。这就像你可以决定给谁关税，对哪个国家或行业征收关税。如果你觉得有人做得好，想帮助他们，你就可以降低他们的关税税率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think this tells you about it, doesn't it? How this change has happened? The deep involvement of the government. Do you also see tariffs in the same way? Is this also one of its functions? Yes.</p>
</details>

所以，这显然是某种程度上的任意行为。即使你喜欢关税作为一种政策，作为一种创收方式，它的执行方式也是非常随意的。所以，这些都是国家主义（Statism: 指国家权力高于个人或社会利益的意识形态或政治体系）抬头和干预增加的迹象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is because tariff policy is very subjective. There is no objectivity or science behind it. It's like you can decide who to give tariffs to, which country or industry to impose tariffs on. And if you feel someone is doing well and you want to help them, you can reduce their tariff rate.</p>
</details>

所以，我很遗憾地说，在过去一年里，我认为我们没有在政府日益增长的作用中看到任何重大转变。所以，您在书中提到的其他因素，为什么资本主义不起作用？您追踪哪些因素？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So this is clearly something that is quite arbitrary. Even if you like tariffs as a policy, as a revenue generator, the way it is implemented is very arbitrary. So, these are all signs of rising statism and increasing intervention.</p>
</details>

对我来说，资本主义仍然有效。问题是，正如书中提到的，《资本主义出了什么问题？》我的回答是，资本主义并没有失败。是政府毁了它。但好消息是，世界上还有其他地方，正如书中提到的，资本主义仍然有效，有效的意思是它正在朝着正确的方向发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I regret to say that in the past year, I don't think we have seen any major shift in the growing role of government. So, the other factors you mentioned in your book, why capitalism doesn't work? What factors do you track?</p>
</details>

美国目前在很大程度上仍然是一个资本主义社会，只是不如以前了。随着时间的推移，它的衰落是显而易见的。但如果我去越南或台湾这样的国家，我看到的是人们仍在朝着提供经济自由的正确方向前进。对我来说，资本主义是什么？资本主义意味着给予人们更多的经济自由，增加更多的竞争，鼓励变革。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For me, capitalism still works. The issue is, as mentioned in the book, What Went Wrong With Capitalism? My answer is that capitalism has not failed. The government has ruined it. But the good news is that there are other parts of the world, as mentioned in the book, where capitalism is still working, and by working, I mean it is moving in the right direction.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为这些是我看到的一些特质，我不喜欢的是结果。实际上，资本主义不应该有利于现有的政府。它应该是一个变革的系统。但日益集中的公司正在占据主导地位。对我来说，这就是资本主义的弊端，不是好迹象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">America is still largely a capitalist society, just not as much as before. Its decline is evident over time. But if I go to countries like Vietnam or Taiwan, I see places where people are still moving in the right direction of providing economic freedom. What is capitalism for me? Capitalism means giving people more economic freedom, increasing competition, encouraging change.</p>
</details>

从美国到中国，让我们在欧洲停留一秒钟。您如何看待欧洲？正如我们去年所说，在许多方面，欧洲的资本主义状况更糟。当你看到法国这样的国家，GDP中的政府支出达到60%时，很难将这些国家归入任何资本主义定义。而且这种情况还在增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I think these are some of the traits I see, and what I don't like are the results. In fact, capitalism should not favor the existing government. It should be a system of change. But increasingly concentrated companies are dominating. For me, these are the shortcomings of capitalism, not good signs.</p>
</details>

欧洲唯一的好处是，正如我们所见，通常在全球范围内，政府只有在经济状况不佳时才会进行重大经济改革。我们在欧洲看到了一些迹象，至少在年初的德国。虽然大部分讨论是关于支出，但仍有一些关于劳动力市场改革和其他方面的讨论。所以，当情况变得糟糕时，改革就会发生。

<details>

<p class="english-text">From America to China, let's pause in Europe for 1 second. How do you see Europe? As we said last year, in many ways, the state of capitalism in Europe is worse. When you look at countries like France, where government spending in GDP reaches 60%, it's hard to classify these countries under any capitalist definition. And this is growing.</p>
</details>

南欧国家就是一个典型的例子。正如你所知，南欧国家在十年前被视为“猪”（指经济落后或管理不善的国家），但我们在过去五年里看到了它们表现得相当好。我认为它们被迫纠正错误，希腊、葡萄牙和西班牙等国的政府作用有所减弱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The only good thing about Europe is that, as we have seen, usually around the world, governments only undertake major economic reforms when their economic situation is poor. We have seen some signs of this in Europe, at least in Germany at the beginning of the year. Although most of the discussion was about spending, there was still some discussion about labor market reforms and other aspects. So, reforms happen when situations worsen.</p>
</details>

但我会稍微挑战你一下，因为我的意思是，它们面临的真正困难有多少？我的意思是，欧洲的生活现在很好。是的，但他们做到了，不是吗？是的，他们做到了。但你看德国、法国、意大利以及整个北欧，情况并没有那么紧张。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The Southern European countries are a classic example. As you know, Southern European countries were dismissed as "pigs" (referring to economically backward or poorly managed countries) a decade ago, but we have seen them perform quite well in the last five years. I think they were forced to correct their mistakes, and the role of government in Greece, Portugal, and Spain has somewhat diminished.</p>
</details>

我的意思是，他们没有面临任何迫在眉睫的危机。是的，生活通常很好。我们年初就看到了这种情况，因为有太多的绝望，特朗普和其他人真的给欧洲施加了压力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I will challenge you a bit, because I mean, how many real difficulties do they face? I mean, life in Europe is good now. Yes, but they did it, didn't they? Yes, they did. But look at Germany, France, Italy, and all of Northern Europe, the situation is not that tense.</p>
</details>

那么，情况需要变得多糟才能让他们觉得需要采取严厉措施？嗯，除非危机发生，否则没人会行动。但危机需要多大？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, they are not facing any immediate crisis. Yes, life is generally good. We saw this at the beginning of the year because there was so much despair, and Trump and others were really putting pressure on Europe.</p>
</details>

应该是花光了所有钱。对吧？这是基本定义。但我认为，年初时我感到一种存在主义危机。也就是说，在德国等地，在达沃斯等地，每个人都对欧洲感到非常沮丧，每个人都忽视了欧洲。这对投资者来说很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, how bad does the situation need to get for them to feel the need to take drastic measures? Well, unless a crisis occurs, no one acts. But how big should the crisis be?</p>
</details>

正如你所知，今年发生的事情很有趣。实际上，美国，至少在相对基础上，是全球表现最差的地区。欧洲非常令人惊讶，不是吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It should be that they run out of money to spend. Right? That's the basic definition. But I think at the beginning of the year, I felt something like an existential crisis. That is, in places like Germany, at places like Davos, everyone was very depressed about Europe, and everyone had overlooked Europe. And this is interesting as an investor.</p>
</details>

因为年初时，每个人都在谈论“美国例外论”交易。人们认为这是世界上唯一值得投资的地方。但实际上，我们今年看到的是，欧洲、新兴市场和中国都跑赢了美国。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As you know, what happened this year has been quite interesting. In fact, America, at least on a relative basis, has been the worst-performing region in the world. Europe is very surprising, isn't it?</p>
</details>

为什么？为什么会这样？我认为，这是因为年初时，所有资金都集中在一个地区，一个国家。可以说，就像你所知，美国在MSCI股票指数中的权重在年初达到了近70%。美元也严重高估。所以，其中一部分只是一个修正。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because at the beginning of the year, everyone was on the "American exceptionalism" trade. It was believed that this was the only place worth investing in the world. But in reality, what we have seen this year is that Europe, emerging markets, and China have all outperformed the US.</p>
</details>

而且，许多国家现在确实在采取措施推进必要的改革。我的意思是，再次，欧洲的期望仍然很低。但至少德国已经开始觉醒，并表示“好吧，我们必须在这里做些改变，无论是增加对正确事物的支出，关注劳动力市场，还是改善去监管化。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why? Why is this happening? I think it's because at the beginning of the year, all the money was concentrated in one region, one country. So to speak, as you know, America's weight in the MSCI equity index reached nearly 70% by the beginning of the year. The dollar was also severely overvalued. So, some part of it is just a correction.</p>
</details>

另一方面，在许多国家，比如中国，我认为发生了一个非常重要的转变。中国意识到，如果我们要与美国在AI领域竞争，我们就必须支持私营部门。中国发生的一个重大转变是，此前它对私营部门采取了敌对态度，这是习近平推行的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And many countries are now indeed taking steps to advance necessary reforms. I mean, again, expectations in Europe are still low. But at least Germany has started to wake up and say, "Okay, we have to make some changes here, whether it's spending more on the right things, focusing on the labor market, or improving de-regulation."</p>
</details>

但我认为，那里发生了一个重要的转变。现在，马云（Jack Ma）已经回到了阿里巴巴，阿里巴巴的股票今年翻了一番。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On the other hand, in many countries, like China, I think a very important shift has occurred. China has realized that if we are to compete with America in AI, we must support the private sector. A major shift in China is that previously it had a hostile attitude towards the private sector, which was promoted by Xi Jinping.</p>
</details>

您认为是什么导致了这种转变？是什么导致了这种转变？嗯，除了AI，中国的经济正面临巨大困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I think an important shift has happened there. Now, Jack Ma has returned to Alibaba, and Alibaba's stock has doubled this year.</p>
</details>

如果从中国剔除AI，经济表现并不好。房地产市场已经崩溃。有报道称，企业、消费者以及所有人都在承受巨大压力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What do you think caused this shift? What caused this shift? Well, apart from AI, China's economy is facing immense difficulties.</p>
</details>

我认为，中国整个想法也有点存在主义。也就是说，他们与美国竞争的方式是依靠AI和科技。而正是在这里，我们看到了巨大的追赶。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you remove AI from China, the economy is not doing well at all. The property market has collapsed. There are reports of how businesses, consumers, and everyone are feeling immense pressure.</p>
</details>

我认为，正如我们所见，1月份的DeepSea时刻是今年年初的一个非常重要的时刻。我认为在中国也发生了类似的事情。所以，这两件事是：一是经济面临巨大困难，二是习近平意识到AI很重要，科技很重要，他们有一个非常好的科技部门。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think China's entire idea is also a bit existential. That is, their way of competing with America relies on AI and technology. And it is here that we have seen a huge catch-up. I think, as we saw, the DeepSea moment in January was a very important moment at the beginning of the year. I think something similar has happened in China too. So, these two things are: one, the economy is facing immense difficulties, and two, Xi Jinping has realized that AI is important, technology is important, and they have a very good tech sector.</p>
</details>

您是否对DeepSea事件后没有看到更多后续感到惊讶？那是一个警钟。美国AI股票的反应非常剧烈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Are you surprised that we haven't seen more follow-up after the DeepSea event? That was a wake-up call. US AI stocks reacted very dramatically.</p>
</details>

是的。然后它们反弹了，我们又忘记了中国的能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. And then they recovered, and we forgot about China's capabilities again.</p>
</details>

绝对是。因为今天，他们并没有停止工作。不，坦率地说，在某些指标上，中国的LLM（Large Language Model: 大型语言模型，一种AI模型，能够理解和生成人类语言）模型已经接近美国水平。也就是说，已经实现了虚拟收敛。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely. Because today, it's not that they have stopped working. No, frankly, on some metrics, Chinese LLM models have reached almost the same level as the US.</p>
</details>

有趣的是，他们为此只花了大约五分之一的成本。因为美国的资本支出已接近半万亿美元。中国的AI资本支出约为1000亿美元。所以这很少。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That is, virtual convergence has been achieved. And interestingly, they are spending only about one-fifth of the cost for this. Because US CapEx spending has reached nearly half a trillion dollars. China's AI CapEx spending is around $100 billion. So this is little.</p>
</details>

但我认为，美国发生的情况是，对AI的信心如此之高，以至于人们愿意投入各种资本。这就是为什么我认为这个问题没有出现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I think what has happened in the US is that there is so much confidence in AI that people are willing to invest all kinds of capital. That's why I don't think this question is arising.</p>

### 利率、美联储政策与泡沫破裂的导火索

尼古拉，这个问题确实会出现，那就是当利率上升时。历史上，每一个泡沫或狂热都是因为同一个原因而破裂的，那就是当利率最终上升时。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nikola, this question will indeed arise, and that is when interest rates rise. Historically, every bubble or mania has burst for the same reason, and that is when interest rates eventually rise.</p>
</details>

为什么利率会上升？如果经济在这种规模上保持强劲。首先，这里的通胀已经相当高了。正如你所知，美联储2%的目标遥遥无期。美联储连续五年未能达到其2%的目标，明年通胀可能接近3%而非2%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why will interest rates rise? If the economy remains strong on this scale. Firstly, inflation here is already quite high. As you know, the Fed's 2% target is nowhere in sight.</p>
</details>

在这样的环境下，美联储为什么要降息，我完全不明白。但他们正在这样做。也许是在白宫的压力下，也许是美联储的历史反应函数。也就是说，他们会在遇到一点麻烦的迹象时做出反应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The Fed has failed to meet its 2% target for five consecutive years, and inflation next year is likely to be closer to 3% than 2%. Why the Fed is cutting interest rates in this environment, I completely fail to understand. But they are doing so. Perhaps under pressure from the White House, perhaps it's the Fed's historical reaction function.</p>
</details>

但当事情进展顺利时，从不做出反应。这很有趣，因为如果看看最近几天发生的事情，美联储已经开始质疑是否应该降息。这就是市场出现一些动荡的原因。但再次，一旦市场出现一些波动，美联储又发出了信号，表示12月份可能会降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That is, they will react at the slightest sign of trouble. But never react when things are going well. And it's interesting because if you look at what has happened in the last few days, the Fed has started questioning whether interest rates should be cut. This is why there has been some volatility in the market. But again, as soon as there was some market fluctuation, the Fed is again signaling that a rate cut might happen in December.</p>
</details>

这只是说明了反应函数是什么。但如果通胀从这里开始加速，因为经济在如此大的规模上仍然非常强劲，AI和其他方面的资本支出增加，而美联储表示“好吧，我们现在必须提高利率”，因为要么我们不能像他们希望的那样降低利率，因为这个国家有负担能力问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This just illustrates what the reaction function is. But if inflation accelerates from here, because the economy remains very strong on this scale, with increased CapEx spending on AI and other things, and the Fed says, "Okay, we must now raise interest rates," because either we cannot lower interest rates as they wish, because this country has affordability problems.</p>
</details>

我认为，那时整个过度投资的AI泡沫就会破裂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that's when the entire over-investment AI bubble will burst.</p>
</details>

关于不那么独立的联邦储备系统，您有什么看法？我认为，关于不那么独立的联邦储备系统，这里有两件事。美联储是否应该改革？我认为美联储确实需要改革。但我认为的是相反的方向。也就是说，美联储在这里有两个问题。一个问题是，它并不像我所说的“我们在这里是为了你的安全”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What are your thoughts on a less independent Federal Reserve? I think, regarding a less independent Federal Reserve, there are two things here. Does the Fed need reform? I think the Fed does need reform. But I think in the opposite direction. That is, the Fed has had two problems here. One problem is that it is not uniform, as I said, "We are here for your safety."</p>
</details>

好消息是，你可以做任何你想做的事。所以，你享受利润，而我们则将你的损失社会化。我认为这是一种需要改变的不对称性。第二点是，美联储应该负责。如果从2000年算起，美联储实际上已经远远偏离了其通胀目标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The good news is, you can do whatever you want. So, you enjoy the profits, and we will socialize your losses. I think this is an asymmetry that needs to be changed. The second point is that the Fed should be held accountable. If we count from 2000, the Fed has actually significantly missed its inflation target.</p>
</details>

如果以直线来看，即2%的通胀与美联储实际达到的目标相比，那么它应该为此负责。所以，这是美联储的改革。另一方面，有些人谈到需要消除任务蔓延（Mission Creep: 指机构或组织超出其最初设定的范围或目标，承担更多职责或活动）。也就是说，美联储不能做所有事情。比如干预所有市场，或者干预货币政策范围之外的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If we look at it in a straight line, i.e., 2% inflation versus what the Fed has actually achieved. Then it should be held responsible for this. So, this is the reform of the Fed. On the other hand, some people talk about the need to eliminate mission creep.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为，是的，美联储需要改革。但认为改革意味着一个不那么独立的联邦储备系统。我真的不知道这意味着什么。正如我所说，我不是美联储政策的忠实粉丝，所以我愿意改革美联储。但改革意味着你想降低利率，因为这将减轻你的债务负担。我认为这是一个错误的政策。所以，独立性和改革是不同的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That is, the Fed cannot do everything. Like intervening in all markets, or intervening in things outside the scope of monetary policy. So, I think, yes, the Fed needs reform. But thinking that reform means a less independent Federal Reserve. I really don't know what that means. As I said, I haven't been a big fan of Fed policy, so I'm open to reforming the Fed. But reform means you want to lower interest rates because it will reduce your debt burden. I think that's a wrong policy. So, independence and reform are different.</p>
</details>

您以前也曾警告过全球政府债务水平高企。您现在如何看待？嗯，今年，除了美国以外，各地都出现了这种情况。英国、日本，甚至法国。在所有这些地方，这些国家沉重的债务负担在某个时候都成了一个问题，迫使它们在所有这些地方做出反应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You have previously warned about high levels of government debt globally. How do you see it now? Well, this year, except for the US, this has happened everywhere. UK, Japan, even France. In all these places, the heavy debt burden on these countries has become an issue at some point, forcing them to react in all these places.</p>
</details>

为什么？为什么在美国不成问题？我认为有两个原因。一是人们对AI的巨大信心，这体现在两个方面。一是AI的信心，这使得大量资金仍然流入美国。二是押注美国在AI领域处于领先地位，因此美国将实现生产力的巨大飞跃。这些高生产力飞跃将有助于稳定债务与GDP之比。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why? Why is it not an issue in the US? I think there are two reasons. One is the immense confidence in AI, which is reflected in two ways. One is the confidence in AI, which causes a lot of money to still flow into the US. The second is the bet that because America is at the forefront of AI, America will achieve a huge leap in productivity.</p>
</details>

第三点，也是令我们大多数人最惊讶的是，尽管美国GDP赤字仍然很高，但实际上有所下降。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">These high productivity leaps will help stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio. The third point, and perhaps the most surprising to most of us, is that despite the high GDP deficit in the US, it has actually decreased.</p>
</details>

这在一定程度上是由于关税，不是吗？关税，绝对是。所以，我认为，是的，他们的关税是有利可图的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is partly due to tariffs, isn't it? Tariffs, absolutely. So, I think, yes, their tariffs are profitable.</p>
</details>

嗯，至少在短期内，表面上看，关税收入帮助将赤字减少了GDP的1%。那么，如果你取消关税，你认为这对市场是好消息还是坏消息？我认为，如果你取消关税，赤字的担忧就会稍微回来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, at least in the short term, on the surface, tariff revenue has helped reduce the deficit by 1% of GDP. So, now if you remove tariffs, do you think this will be good news or bad news for the market?</p>
</details>

就像对收益的积极影响，甚至比这更大。是的，但我认为关税不会完全消失。但我认为，并非今年关税没有任何负面影响。我所说的是，是的，关税对经济增长产生了负面影响。它只是被AI支出和其他方面的希望所抵消。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think if you remove tariffs, the concern about the deficit will come back a bit. Even more than the positive impact on earnings. Yes, but I don't think tariffs will be completely removed.</p>
</details>

所以，关税对经济增长有负面影响。我们只是不认为它有那么大的负面影响，因为从整体经济角度来看，AI带来的积极支出正在弥补关税造成的损失。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I don't think it has had such a significantly negative impact. I mean, what I'm saying is, yes, tariffs have had a negative impact on economic growth. It's just been largely offset by the hope around AI spending and other things.</p>
</details>

### 未来展望：AI泡沫的命运与投资新趋势

去年，中美之间的敌意发生了什么变化？我认为，人们意识到，尤其是在美国，他们对中国的依赖程度比预期的要大。因为年初时，大多数人的计算是，中国是一个大出口国，需要美国市场，无论如何。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, tariffs have a negative impact on economic growth. We just don't think it has had such a significantly negative impact because, from an overall economic perspective, the positive spending from AI is compensating for the losses from tariffs.</p>
</details>

所以，似乎美国拥有所有的谈判筹码。但我觉得，在过去的几个月里，我们了解到中国也拥有谈判筹码，无论是通过稀土带来的优势。所以，我认为改变的是，根深蒂固的不信任感依然存在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Last year, what has changed in the hostility between China and America? I think the realization has dawned that, especially in America, they are more dependent on China than they expected. Because at the beginning of the year, most people's calculation was that China is a big exporter and needs the American market, no matter what.</p>
</details>

但我认为，像特朗普这样的人是交易型的，而且他们也知道依赖性是什么？什么是共同依赖性？所以，我认为，两国之间发生的变化是，人们意识到存在巨大的相互依赖性，而你无法轻易摆脱它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it seemed like America had all the bargaining chips. But I think, in the past few months, we have learned that China also has bargaining chips, whether it's the advantage derived from rare earths. So, I think what has changed is that deep mistrust remains.</p>
</details>

最后，Ruchir，如果你要预测未来12个月会发生什么，最重要的因素是什么？我一直在思考这个问题。每年我都会写关于我年度十大趋势的文章，我一直在思考这个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I think people like Trump are transactional, and they also know what dependence is? What is codependence? So, I think what has changed in both countries is the realization that there is immense interdependence, and you cannot easily get rid of it.</p>
</details>

也许AI能持续多久？因为现在一切都围绕着AI。问题是，它能持续多久？AI泡沫会在2026年破裂吗？这是最大的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Finally, Ruchir, if you were to predict what will happen in the next 12 months, what are the most important factors? I've been thinking about this. Every year I write about my top 10 trends for the year, and I've been thinking about this.</p>
</details>

经过这么多年的实践，有一点很清楚，那就是预测泡沫何时破裂是不可能的。但是的，我们确实有一个检查清单。所以，一旦有任何迹象表明利率将上升，在我看来，那就是你应该明白“好吧，这个周期正在结束”的时刻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Perhaps how long will AI last? Because right now, everything revolves around AI. The question is, how long can it sustain itself, and will this bubble burst in 2026? That's the biggest question.</p>
</details>

你可以成为一个明智的投资者，并说“我将等待明确的信号。我将等待泡沫破裂，然后退出。”但还有一件事我注意到，我想稍微教一下。因为如果这是真的，有时你会觉得这是当前最好的投资理念。我一直在研究这个问题，我认为，要以一个大趋势来衡量，2026年将是购买优质股票的绝佳时机。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">After doing this for so many years, one thing is clear: it is impossible to predict when a bubble will burst. But yes, we do have a kind of checklist. So, as soon as there is any sign that interest rates are going to go up, in my opinion, that is the moment when you should understand that "Okay, this cycle is ending."</p>
</details>

事实上，在过去12个月里，优质股票的表现非常糟糕。质量作为一个因素，确实表现不佳。是的。通常，它以增长和更高的投资回报来衡量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can be a wise investor and say, "I will wait for a clear signal. I will wait for the bubble to burst, and then exit." But there is one more thing I have noticed, and I want to teach it a bit. Because if this is true, sometimes you feel that this is the best investment idea currently available, and I have been working on it.</p>
</details>

具有非常高的股本回报率（ROE - Return on Equity: 公司净利润与股东权益的比率）和杠杆，并且可以轻松地根据估值和增长等关键指标进行选择。但我发现，过去12个月是优质股票记录中最糟糕、最艰难的时期之一。所以，这可能是一个绝佳的时机。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think, measured as a big trend, 2026 will be an excellent time to buy quality stocks. In fact, quality stocks have performed very poorly in the last 12 months. Quality as a factor has really underperformed. Yes.</p>
</details>

我们行业中有太多的担忧，比如“好吧，我们应该买什么？”一方面是AI泡沫和其他因素，一切看起来都很昂贵。另一方面，一些保险，如黄金和石油，也大幅上涨。我们不能再投入更多资金。该怎么办？总有一种恐惧感。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Typically, it is measured by growth and higher returns on investment. With very high ROE and leverage, and you can easily select them based on key metrics like valuation and growth. But I have found the last 12 months to be one of the worst and most difficult periods on record for quality stocks. So, this could be an excellent time.</p>
</details>

好的。所以，一个预测。那么，这个预测是优质股票将再次受到青睐吗？我认为优质股票将再次受到青睐？在我看来，你只需要购买优质股。如果这是我必须做的唯一一件事，那么我认为，正如我所说，明年某个时候AI泡沫将以某种方式破裂，也许是因为利率更高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There is too much concern in our industry, like "Okay, what should we buy?" On one hand, due to the AI bubble and other factors, everything looks very expensive. On the other hand, some insurance, like gold and oil, have also risen sharply. We cannot invest more money in them. What to do? There is always a sense of fear.</p>
</details>

我不知道确切的时间，但我觉得购买优质股现在越来越受欢迎。第三件事是，国际市场跑赢美国市场的趋势，一旦开始，往往会持续多年。我不认为2025年只是昙花一现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So, a prediction. So, is this prediction that quality stocks will once again be favored? I think quality stocks will be favored again? In my opinion, you just need to buy quality stocks. If this is the only thing I have to do, then I think, as I said, the AI bubble will burst somehow next year, perhaps due to higher interest rates.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为国际公司跑赢美国市场的趋势，在我看来，将在2026年继续。太棒了。Ruchir，我期待着明年11月再次回来，我们将回顾这些预测，看看它们效果如何。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know the exact timing, but I feel buying quality stocks is becoming increasingly popular. The third thing is that the trend of international markets outperforming the US, once it starts, tends to last for many years. I don't think 2025 was just a fleeting moment.</p>
</details>

太棒了。谢谢你，尼古拉。太棒了。谢谢。嗯。
