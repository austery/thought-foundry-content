title: AI时代下的“护城河”：软件如何重塑市场与竞争格局
---
### AI时代下软件市场机遇的根本性转变

当前产品周期的根本不同之处在于，软件本身能够实际完成工作，因此，如今软件的市场机会不再仅仅是IT支出，而主要在于劳动力成本。这并非意味着所有工作都会消失，我实际上认为这根本不会发生。有很多任务，如果我能以一美元的价格雇人完成，我百分之百会这样做。但我从未能以一美元雇到人。现在，我可以用一美元“雇佣”软件。虽然了解模型能力和前沿技术发展很重要，但你仍然需要弄清楚如何应用这项技术。

<p class="english-text">The thing that is fundamentally different about this product cycle is that the software itself can actually do the work and therefore the market opportunity for software today is no longer just IT spend. It's largely labor. It's not like all the jobs will go away. I actually think that's not going to happen at all. There are a lot of things where if I could hire somebody for a dollar to do this task, I would 100% do that. I've never been able to hire somebody for a dollar. Now I can hire software for a dollar. While it is important to understand model capabilities and what's happening in the frontier, you still need to figure out how to apply that technology.</p>

我认为“护城河”（moats: 企业在竞争中保持优势的壁垒）依然像以前一样重要。唯一的变化是，在这个供需关系中，软件的供应在概念上增加了，因为创建这些东西的门槛已经大大降低了。

<p class="english-text">I think modes matter just as much as they did before. The one change is that in this supply demand equation, there's conceptually more supply of software on the because the barrier to creating this stuff has gone down dramatically.</p>

我认为AI是实现差异化的绝佳工具。例如，一个语音代理能够以50种语言全天候24/7地完全合规地进行交流，这无疑是高度差异化的，尤其与人类相比。但在我看来，这种能力的来源本身并不是防御性的来源，它更多地是差异化。软件产品的防御性，在我看来，在于拥有端到端的工作流程，在于其应用所处的上下文，在于成为“记录系统”（system of record: 存储关键业务数据的核心系统），拥有网络效应，以及深度嵌入客户内部。我认为这些一直是我们评估软件公司时会寻找的启发式（heuristics: 经验法则）。

<p class="english-text">I think AI is an incredible tool for differentiation. The idea that a voice agent can speak in 50 languages fully compliantly 24/7 highly differentiated you know certainly versus the human theess of that capability in my opinion is not a source of defensibility it is just so consensus like cloud was not consensus mobile was not consensus and that's why the incumbents kind of screwed up. We've spent a lot of time talking about moes and how moes have evolved and are there still even moes in in this new era. And so why don't you reflect and share some of the conversations we've been having or some of your your perspectives on this broader broader moat question. Maybe David we'll we'll start with you. Maybe just to jump right into it with with a hot take. I think moes still matter and I think a lot of the moes um still matter. Still matter. Exactly. Um and I think they're largely the same. Right. I think you know I often think about this between uh sort of differentiation and defensibility. I think AI is an incredible tool for differentiation, right? The idea that, you know, a voice agent can speak in 50 languages fully compliantly 247, highly differentiated, you know, certainly versus the human. Um, but the source, the AIS of that capability, in my opinion, is not a source of defensibility. It it's largely differentiation. The defensibility of a software product resides in my opinion you know from owning the end workflow you know from the context in which that it's it's applied you know becoming the system of record having a network effect you know deeply embedding yourself within your customer and I think these were the heruristics that were always you know things that we would always look for when evaluating software companies I think the thing that is fundamentally different about this product cycle is that the software itself can actually do the work right and therefore the market opportunity for for software today is no longer or just IT spend. It's it's largely labor.</p>

### 规模效应与“护城河”的挑战

挑战在于，每个人都可以在小规模上构建一些东西，而许多防御性的“护城河”——我不会称之为网络效应，但它们是某种防御性——只有在达到大规模时才会显现。例如，很多人会谈论很久很久以前，在AI时代之前的一个例子：如果我正在建立一家反欺诈公司，并且已经见过很多人，我是否会比一家刚刚起步、只见过少数人的新反欺诈公司做得更好？这就是所谓的“数据网络效应”（data network effect: 指产品或服务的价值随着用户数量的增加而提高，特别是通过积累更多数据来提升）。虽然我和Martine很久以前做过一个播客，讨论数据网络效应是否真实存在，但它确实像引力一样。一个原子确实对你施加引力，但你只有在非常大的尺度上才能真正感受到它，比如地球、太阳、木星，你会注意到它们的引力，但你不会注意到一个玻璃杯的引力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The challenge often has been that everybody can build something at small scale and a lot of the they kind of I wouldn't call them network effects but some of the defensibility modes only become uh apparent at large large scale. So like a lot of people talk about like okay take an example from like the the long long time ago pre prei era um if I am building an anti-fraud company and I've seen lots of people right am I going to do a better job than a net new anti-fraud company that's seen a few people and the reason why this would be called a data network effect although um there's another podcast that Martine and I did a long time ago debating whether or not data network effects are real but it's something that really it's almost like gravity gravity actually like one atom actually has exerts gravity on you but you only really see it at like very very large scale like the earth you notice the gravity the sun you you notice the gravity Jupiter you notice the gravity you don't notice it for like that glass and it's the same thing for a lot of these data network effects where at very very small scale when you have 20 companies that are all saying I'm going to stop fraud like all right they're all building the same things they all have the same algorithms but when you've seen four billion people and you know like these people are bad Now you can sell each incremental customer each customer of your anti-fraud technology to to use this example because you've seen more customers and you can get actually better results. But the challenge is that a lot of these these moes only really are evident at mega mega mega scale. And the same argument would apply. It's like oh like I've seen four customers. David's seen three. I've seen four. He's seen three. Pick pick my software. But it's like you've seen four customers. That means there are eight billion customers you haven't seen. there eight billion customers he hasn't seen like what's the difference whereas um at mega scale it's like all right I've seen four billion customers he's seen one billion customers well it's actually kind of easy to see that the results of my product will be better but that's at scale um and a lot of the question is like on the 0ero to one phase it's hard to make the argument that like I have better like if it's fraud I have better fraud underwriting if it's you know AI do the work like I've done more phone calls to a particular type of customer and therefore I do a job. It's hard to make that argument at subscale. So, and this is often the challenge is that it's kind of self-evident that if you become the biggest company in the world, then you have a moat. But how do you get to the scale where you actually could show that you can't get to that scale if you have 9 million ankle biters um and you are yourself an ankle biter of just we are trying to get to scale and nobody can because it's so easy to actually produce software. And that's kind of the that's the double-edged sword of AI is that it's very very easy to produce software. Um, everybody can go do something that is a very obvious idea because it's obvious everybody's going to go build it. But can you get to the type of scale where you actually could show a mode and that that has gotten, you know, arguably harder because you have a larger end count of potential c sorry uh potential competitors. Um, but if you get to mega scale, then you could show the moat and that that's kind of the zero to one versus one to end.</p>

对于许多数据网络效应来说也是如此，在非常小的规模下，当有20家公司都声称要阻止欺诈时，它们都在构建相同的东西，拥有相同的算法。但当你见过40亿人，并且知道哪些人是“坏人”时，你就可以向每个新增客户销售你的反欺诈技术，因为你见过更多的客户，并且可以获得更好的结果。但挑战在于，许多这样的“护城河”只有在超大规模下才真正显现。同样的论点也适用：我见过四个客户，David见过三个；我见过四个，他见过三个。选择我的软件吧。但问题是，你只见过四个客户，这意味着还有80亿客户你没见过，他也没见过，这有什么区别呢？然而，在超大规模下，比如我见过40亿客户，他见过10亿客户，那么我的产品结果会更好就很容易看出来。但这必须是在规模化之后。

很多问题在于，在从零到一的阶段，很难论证我拥有更好的东西。比如，如果是欺诈，我拥有更好的欺诈承保；如果是AI完成工作，我给特定类型的客户打过更多电话，因此我做得更好。在未达到规模时，很难提出这样的论点。所以，这通常是一个挑战：如果你成为世界上最大的公司，那么你拥有护城河，这似乎是显而易见的。但你如何达到能够展示出护城河的规模呢？如果你有900万个“小竞争者”（ankle biters: 指那些规模小但数量众多，不断蚕食市场份额的竞争者），你自己也是其中之一，都在努力扩大规模，但没有人能成功，因为生产软件太容易了。这就是AI的双刃剑：生产软件非常非常容易。每个人都可以去做一个非常显而易见的事情，因为显而易见，每个人都会去做。但你是否能达到那种可以展示出护城河的规模呢？这无疑变得更难了，因为潜在竞争者的数量增加了。但如果你达到了超大规模，你就可以展示出护城河，这就是从零到一与从一到N的区别。

### AI时代下企业防御性的变化与定价模式

那么，在AI时代，即使是大型公司，其防御性与Web 2.0时代相比有何不同？今天的公司是更具防御性，还是防御性更弱？我们应该如何看待这种实力？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And maybe talk about what's different about defensibility for even the the bigger players today in the AI era than it was in let's say the web two era. Are the companies today more defensible, less defensible, or how should we think about sort of the strength?</p>
</details>

我认为防御性更弱的部分，是很多企业软件在公开市场上受到打击的原因，这主要有两个。首先，如果你采用按席位（per-seat pricing: 按用户数量或席位收费的模式）定价，你如何提出一个人们觉得公平的定价模型？这很大程度上是心理作用。在过去的20年里，不知何故，按月按席位收费，就像我开玩笑说的，星巴克的“高、大、超大杯”模式（tall, grande, venti model: 指星巴克通过不同杯型进行差异化定价的策略）的软件收费方式，人们觉得这很公平。无论公平与否，人们会觉得“哦，每月每席位85美元，听起来合理”。然而，如果你在40年前提出这个定价，你会被嘲笑。所以，这只是成为了常态。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I don't know. I I think the the less defensible part I mean this is this is why a lot of enterprise software has gotten beaten up in the public markets. It's kind of two reasons. is number one is that if you're doing per seat pricing like how do you come up with a pricing model that people feel is fair and a lot of it is just psychology and for whatever reason for the last 20 years it's like per seat per month with like uh you know you you've heard my joke the the tall grande venty model of like software uh charging it's like somehow that felt fair and whether that is fair or not like I don't know but like people are like oh yeah it's like $85 a seat you know per month yeah okay that sounds reasonable whereas if you if you propose that pricing 40 years ago, you would have been laughed out of town. So, this just became the norm. Um, and the reason why, as I was saying, public software companies have been beaten up a little bit is like, uhoh, maybe you won't sell as many seats. Like, is Adobe going to sell as many seats if now you don't have to hire as many graphics designers? Or is Zenesk going to sell as many seats if the software just answers all the queries? Like, the answer is no. It doesn't mean that the companies are toast. they might actually quadruple their revenue because now they charge per outcomes as opposed to charging perceipats. But that's kind of part one.</p>
</details>

我之前提到，公共软件公司受到打击的原因是：“噢，也许你卖不出那么多席位了。”比如，如果现在不需要雇佣那么多平面设计师，Adobe还能卖出那么多席位吗？如果软件能回答所有查询，Zendesk还能卖出那么多席位吗？答案是不能。但这不意味着这些公司就完蛋了。它们实际上可能会使收入翻两番，因为它们现在是按结果收费，而不是按席位收费。这是第一部分。第二部分是，等等，现在每个人都可以“vibe code”（vibe code: 指利用AI工具或低代码/无代码平台快速、轻松地开发软件，甚至与现有产品竞争）出一个Zendesk的竞争对手。所以，也许公司会停止购买软件。这一点我认为我们还没有看到。但我认为存在这两个风险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Part two is wait a minute now everybody can vibe code up a Zenesk competitor. So maybe companies will just start they'll stop buying software. This one I don't think we've seen at all. Um but I think there is that like these two-sided um these two risks. But to answer your question, does defensibility change? Well, if you now are able to code your own software, like why am I paying like your margin is my opportunity. Well, look at the margin of software companies. Like Salesforce has like an 80% gross margin. Like they should have a 1% gross margin or you know nobody should use Salesforce anymore. That that would be the procase of Moes really starting to disintegrate. But I don't think we've seen that happen at all. Um because it turns out people um on on the one hand two things are actually happening. One is that this is kind of like Clay Christensen theory. It's like the incumbents overshoot the market. So the amount of features in Salesforce or Zenesk or Netswuite, it way exceeds the feature set that you need that any individual customer needs because it's meant to encompass. It's like all of these weird edge cases and you kind of see this if you use Microsoft Word. When was the last time you wrote a book? When? Never. Right. I haven't written a book. It has all of these things. They probably have 50 software engineers. Yeah. make make but but if you do write a book, guess what? Microsoft Word has all these features just for book authors to like make a table of contents or something. It's like I don't use that. So they they keep bundling more stuff in there so they overshoot the market and theoretically it's going to make it easier for somebody but you know so that but but kind of going back to what I where I started with this topic. Um like it turns out that this concept of I'm just going to vibe code Microsoft right it's like there are all these there there are these edge cases that you just don't know about. So it it's actually, you know, why don't you grow your own food or weld your own aluminum or build your own house. It's just it's kind of easier to use this concept of comparative advantage um and just say I'm going to buy something off the shelf. So anyway, so I think modes matter just as much as they did before. The the one change is that in this supply demand equation, there's conceptually more supply of software on the come um because the the barrier to creating this stuff has gone down dramatically. I I think the flip side to that too is that um while while there will be more software and and again the kind of marginal cost of producing software is you know declining asmtoically towards zero um the way that these companies are getting more deeply entrenched within their customers has has differed because again the software is doing the work and therefore in many cases it's actually replacing labor. And so if you've transitioned a team out that has now become, you know, your software, like you're now much more dependent on that product to run your business, um, you know, and again, you know, is it more difficult to to replace that software with another piece of software or to rehire that team? I think it's an open question, but again, the software is is doing more of the work and therefore, I think, getting more deeply embedded within their customers.</p>
</details>

回到你的问题，防御性是否会改变？如果你现在能够自己编写软件，那我为什么要付费？你的利润就是我的机会。看看软件公司的利润率，比如Salesforce的毛利率高达80%。他们应该只有1%的毛利率，否则就没人会再用Salesforce了。那将是“护城河”真正开始瓦解的有力证据。但我认为我们根本没有看到这种情况发生，因为实际上有两件事正在发生。

首先，这有点像**克莱·克里斯坦森**（Clay Christensen: 著名商业理论家，提出“颠覆性创新”理论）的理论：现有企业往往会“过度满足市场”（overshoot the market: 指产品功能过多、过于复杂，超出了主流客户的需求）。Salesforce、Zendesk或Netsuite的功能数量远远超过了任何单个客户所需的功能集，因为它们旨在涵盖所有这些奇怪的边缘情况。如果你使用Microsoft Word，你就会看到这一点。你上次写书是什么时候？从没写过，对吧？我没写过书。但它有所有这些功能。他们可能有50名软件工程师来开发这些功能。但如果你真的写书，猜猜怎么着？Microsoft Word有所有这些专门为图书作者设计的功能，比如制作目录之类的。我不用那些。所以他们不断地把更多的东西捆绑进去，从而“过度满足市场”，理论上这会让某些人更容易使用。

但回到我开始这个话题时所说的，事实证明，这种“我只是要vibe code一个Microsoft”的概念，存在所有你不知道的边缘情况。所以，这实际上就像你为什么不自己种食物，不自己焊接铝材，或者不自己盖房子一样。使用“比较优势”（comparative advantage: 指一个经济实体在生产某种产品或服务时，相对于其他实体拥有更低的成本或更高的效率）的概念，直接购买现成的东西会更容易。

所以，我认为“护城河”仍然像以前一样重要。唯一的变化是，在这个供需关系中，软件的供应在概念上增加了，因为创建这些东西的门槛已经大大降低了。我认为另一方面是，虽然会有更多的软件，而且生产软件的边际成本（marginal cost: 每增加一个单位产品所增加的总成本）正在渐近地趋近于零，但这些公司更深入地嵌入客户内部的方式已经有所不同，因为软件正在完成工作，因此在许多情况下，它实际上正在取代劳动力。所以，如果你已经将一个团队转变为软件，那么你现在就更依赖这个产品来运营你的业务。再次，用另一个软件取代它，或者重新雇佣那个团队，哪个更困难？我认为这是一个悬而未决的问题，但软件正在做更多的工作，因此，我认为它正在更深入地嵌入客户内部。

<p class="english-text">Well, part part of it is just like the Goldilock zone of pricing. So, um, and I I wrote some tweet or whatever it's called X thread about this a long time ago. I call it the janitorial services problem because if I went to you, you're the CEO of a giant company where you write your books, um, in the future. So, you have a 300,000 person company. I find you, I was like, Eric, I can get your toilets 9% cleaner and save you 1% on your toiletry spend or your your janitorial services spend. Not only do you not care, you don't even care enough. you don't you won't even like exercise the mental energy to find the person in the company who does care, right? And that means that your janitorial services spend will never change. And the problem is it's hard to get in. The good news is it it's hard to get out. Um whereas for something it's like 90% of my profits go to like you the or to I'm now 90% of your profits as the CEO of GE. They're going to me. Your number one priority is like getting the hell off of me, right? And like doing RFPs left and right. So part of it is also just like how relevant this is. And there are some companies that operate in this Goldilock zone of irrelevance like these janitorial services where even if you have 9 million competitors like they're just not going to go anywhere. Which is why like a lot of the strategy that we talk about internally is green field, right? It's like those companies are they're they're stuck for good. Um, is there a a high rate of new company creation that will not use the crappy old janitorial services company but will actually resonate like your pitch of like I will get your toilets cleaner and I will charge you less money that really resonates but that's that's not going to resonate to the people that are using the oldfashioned stuff.</p>

### 定价的“金发姑娘区”与“绿地”机遇

其中一部分就像定价的“金发姑娘区”（Goldilocks zone: 指一个恰到好处的范围，既不太高也不太低）。我很久以前写过一篇关于这个的推文或X帖子，我称之为“清洁服务问题”。因为如果我去找你，你是一家巨型公司的首席执行官，未来你在那里写书。所以你有一家30万人的公司。我找到你，我说：“Eric，我能让你的厕所清洁度提高9%，并为你的清洁服务支出节省1%。”你不仅不在乎，你甚至懒得花精力去公司里找那个会在乎的人，对吧？这意味着你的清洁服务支出永远不会改变。问题是，进入这个市场很难。好消息是，离开这个市场也很难。

然而，对于某些事情，比如我90%的利润都流向你，或者作为GE的CEO，你90%的利润现在都流向我。你的首要任务就是摆脱我，对吧？然后会到处进行“RFP”（Request for Proposal: 招标书，企业寻求供应商解决方案时发出的正式文件）。所以，其中一部分也与相关性有关。有些公司在这个“无关紧要的金发姑娘区”运营，就像这些清洁服务一样，即使你有900万个竞争对手，它们也不会消失。这就是为什么我们内部讨论的很多策略都是“绿地”（greenfield: 指全新的市场或领域，没有现有竞争者或传统解决方案）。那些公司已经“被困”住了。

是否存在大量新公司创建，它们不会使用那些糟糕的老式清洁服务公司，而是会真正引起共鸣？比如你的推销：“我能让你的厕所更干净，而且收费更低。”这确实会引起共鸣，但这不会对那些使用老式服务的人产生共鸣。

<p class="english-text">What are examples of of of company or space in the Goldilock zone and what was an example of companies or spaces in the green field zones? Well, like payroll companies, right? like um ADP and paychecks I mean these are companies that are collectively worth hundreds of billions of dollars um very very profitable and how does pay like you could do your own payroll actually it's kind of a good metaphor for software in general like why is it that you have to like why can't I just pay you you're my employee why can't I just like cut you a check well because I have to withhold taxes well how much tax do I have to withhold well it depends right and there is this like super complicated lookup table it's like well you live in this county but you spend this many days in New York and this that and the other thing oh and you you you you you owe like child support and the IRS is garnishing your wages, like all of these things that are very complicated. So, it turns out it's just cheaper to go to ADP and ADP just charges you like I don't know like 50 bucks a month per person that you might be paying 100. It's a it's a poultry sum compared to the overall amount of payroll. So, nobody really switches their payroll companies. Like that would be an example of one. On the other side, um I had a lot of companies in coming out of 2022 where the market really went through a downturn and they're like, "Wait a minute. I'm spending four I I had a thousand employees. Uh I downsized to 200 employees. I had a,000 licenses for Salesforce, right? What's a,000 time $100 a month times 12? That's $1.2 million a year. Wow. Like that's a lot of money because I only have 200 employees and I only have six months of cash. Like I got to save that." and they didn't do that for their payroll spent. So you see it um uh like a lot of companies do want to rationalize their overall software cost especially for these things where they recognize in aggregate like most people aren't actually using the seats. Um, so I'd say like, you know, Salesforce type stuff. Um, you know, some of the creative tools like if you like Adobe is very expensive and you might just do like a wall-to-wall license saying, why not? But then you look at if you're like, how do I save $5 million? Nobody's using this. Well, it's $5 million. Whereas for things where inextricably the delivery and the payment are linked, right, which is very very different than percemole. Like obviously I'm not going to pay for payroll services unless you were employed here. Whereas I might like we have 600 people that work at our firm. I think we have 600 licenses from Microsoft Office 365. Like we probably I bet there are a lot of people here who have not opened Microsoft Excel in a year. So why are we paying for that? And that would be the idea of kind of rationalizing software spend. Um so it it it kind of depends, but I think per seed pricing where it's like it's just easier to pay for the entire thing wallto-wall, you know, your in your entire organization, those are often the first to go versus things that are again inextricably linked to the actual usage.</p>

哪些公司或领域属于“金发姑娘区”，哪些属于“绿地”区？比如薪资公司，像ADP和Paychex，这些公司总市值高达数千亿美元，利润丰厚。你可以自己处理薪资，这实际上是软件的一个很好的比喻。为什么你不能直接支付你的员工呢？因为我必须预扣税款。预扣多少税呢？这取决于情况，对吧？有一个极其复杂的查询表，比如你住在这个县，但在纽约待了这么多天，还有其他各种情况，哦，你还欠子女抚养费，国税局（IRS: 美国国家税务局）正在扣押你的工资，所有这些都非常复杂。所以，结果是去ADP更便宜，ADP每月每人可能只收你50美元，而你可能要支付100美元。与总薪资金额相比，这只是一笔微不足道的费用。所以，没有人真正会更换他们的薪资公司。这会是一个例子。

另一方面，在2022年市场经历低迷之后，我有很多公司面临这样的情况：“等等，我花了四……我有一千名员工，我裁员到了200名。我有1000个Salesforce许可证，对吧？1000乘以每月100美元再乘以12个月是多少？那是每年120万美元。哇！那是一大笔钱，因为我只有200名员工，而且只有六个月的现金。我必须节省开支。”但他们没有在薪资支出上这样做。所以你会看到，很多公司确实希望合理化他们的整体软件成本，特别是对于那些他们总体上意识到大多数人并没有真正使用这些席位的产品。所以，我会说像Salesforce这类产品，以及一些创意工具，比如Adobe非常昂贵，你可能会直接购买一个全公司范围的许可证，心想为什么不呢？但当你审视如何节省500万美元时，你会发现没人使用这些。

然而，对于那些交付和支付密不可分的事物，情况就大不相同了。比如，我显然不会为薪资服务付费，除非你在这里工作。而我们公司有600名员工，我想我们有600个Microsoft Office 365许可证。我敢打赌，这里很多人一年都没有打开过Microsoft Excel。那我们为什么要为此付费呢？这就是合理化软件支出的想法。所以这取决于情况，但我认为按席位定价，即更容易为整个组织购买全套服务的产品，往往是首先被削减的，而那些与实际使用密不可分的则不然。

<p class="english-text">Yeah. So you mentioned earlier that we've seen you know basically you mentioned uh there was this concern that maybe instead of zenesk it will you know companies will you know there'll be a vibe coded version of it but we've seen none of that. So, so far is your mental model is we'll we'll see it to the in examples where the the cost is significantly high or in which there's sort of green field opportunities or what is sort of your mental model for the types of software that will replace? Yeah, I mean I think the green field one is always true but when you look at green field opportunities you need two things to be true. You need the entrepreneur to be very very patient and say I'm not going to try to sell to everybody who's if I'm if I'm starting a net new payroll company I'm not going to try to sell to GE because I recognize that they are they are hostages to ADP and that's never going to change. So one is that patience of entrepreneur and the other one is you just need a a high enough rate of new company creation to really make it work which is why um like to pick on one space of electronic health records or electronic medical records how many new hospital systems are created every day I mean it rounds to zero so if I'm trying to go build a new EHR system to go compete with Epic or Cerner I can do that um there are a lot of edge cases there but it's like and I might have patience as an entrepreneur but wait a minute like I need to sell $5 million deals to big hospital systems. Every single hospital on Earth is currently using an EHR system. Going to be really really hard to make that work. So I think I think both of those need to be true. Like the right type of entrepreneur who's willing to be patient because it's it's often a very lonely game of it's like I built this great product. Wait a minute. I don't have any customers yet. And you want to see high traction because you're seeing in the rest of the market like some companies are just going like this and my company's not and I'm in Silicon Valley and I need to recruit the best people. It's like they want to work at the company that has the graph like this, but you need this green field requires patience.</p>

### “绿地”机遇：耐心与新公司创建率

你之前提到，我们看到了一种担忧，即Zendesk可能会被“vibe code”版本取代，但我们并没有看到这种情况。那么，到目前为止，你的心智模型是，我们会在成本显著高昂或存在“绿地”机会的例子中看到这种情况，还是你对将被取代的软件类型有何心智模型？

我认为“绿地”机会总是存在的，但当你审视“绿地”机会时，需要满足两个条件。你需要创业者非常有耐心，并说我不会试图向所有人销售。如果我正在创办一家全新的薪资公司，我不会试图向GE销售，因为我认识到他们是ADP的“人质”，这种情况永远不会改变。所以，一是创业者的耐心，二是你需要足够高的新公司创建率才能真正奏效。这就是为什么，举个例子，在电子健康记录（EHR: Electronic Health Record，电子病历系统）或电子医疗记录领域，每天有多少新的医院系统被创建？几乎为零。所以，如果我试图建立一个新的EHR系统去与Epic或Cerner竞争，我可以做到，尽管有很多边缘情况。我可能作为一名创业者有耐心，但等等，我需要向大型医院系统销售500万美元的交易。地球上的每家医院目前都在使用EHR系统。要做到这一点真的非常非常困难。

所以，我认为这两点都必须成立：合适的创业者，愿意有耐心，因为这通常是一个非常孤独的游戏，就像“我开发了这个很棒的产品。等等，我还没有任何客户。”你希望看到高增长，因为你看到市场上的其他公司都在快速发展，而我的公司却没有，我在硅谷，我需要招募最优秀的人才。他们希望在增长曲线如此陡峭的公司工作，但“绿地”需要耐心。

### AI时代下竞争的加剧与创始人特质

我们正在讨论“护城河”依然重要，而且在很多方面它们看起来非常相似。让我们暂时从另一个角度来思考。为什么我们甚至会进行这样的对话，有些人会说：“嘿，品牌就是交付速度，或者因为这个时代不同了。”他们的论点是什么？

<p class="english-text">Well, look, I I think this market is noisier than ever, right? And so I think finding ways to sort of you know stand out from the crowd probably matters more today than it has you know in the past I would argue. I think the other thing is that the the underlying technology is changing so quickly. And so you know as a founder you want to be living on the frontier and understanding kind of what model capabilities look like because it can dramatically change the the efficacy or the the um you know the capability of your underlying product. Um and so I think you know um you know one of the things that's changed I think that's been really interesting in this sort of um you know current wave of especially vertical applications that we've seen is is the type of founder. You know I think founders today are often younger and more technical than we've seen in in prior generations. um you know and and so they're less often native to the particular industry but they're fluent in the tool set right and I think that's really important because you know to the same point you you got to you got to stay on the frontier and understand what's coming at the same time you know I wrote this piece that I call context is king you know while it is important to understand you know model capabilities and and what's happening in the frontier you still need to figure out how to apply that technology and so while the founders themselves are maybe less native to the particular industry they're still hiring for context, you know, very early in a company's life cycle. A good example of this that I I sit on the board of is a company called Eve. You know, the two founders of Eve were the earliest employees at Rubric, which is, you know, now a public infrastructure company. Um, you know, they built a legal AI company in the plaintiff law space. Neither of them had any particular background in in employment law or or personal injury, but they deeply understood, you know, how to apply, you know, document extraction technology and and sort of, you know, voice and LLMs more broadly to this very particular work, you know, uh, workflow. And they've hired plaintiff attorneys actually on staff. So anytime a new model is released, you know, they're understanding, you know, from people in industry the impact that it's having on on drafting on, you know, their ability to, you know, to reason through a case, you know, or a matter. Um and so again it's sort of this tension of like you know building the brand having momentum you know understanding what's happening on the frontier and yet you know figuring out ways to apply that technology in the context you know of your specific customer because again I I I deeply believe that that is where a lot of the sources of defensibility reside. You know I'm I'd love to find other examples of businesses is um where the technology like reinforces their business model. It doesn't compete with it. Meaning in lots of areas of legal um if you make your employee 50 times more efficient you're eroding your billable hour. In their business they operate at a contingency basis meaning you know they only get paid if they make if they win. So there's no sort of limit to the amount of AI that they want to adopt. Uh and if you can become 5x more efficient you can take on 5x more clients. Um anyway these are sort of characteristics that I think you know I'd love to find more of and hopefully that can be kind of a bad signal too. I think the other steelman is if you believe that brand matters which it almost taologically does because what do I buy? I buy the thing that I've heard of, right? So there's an advantage there. And if you believe that for a lot of companies and products, somehow having scale is effective, right? So not a network effect, but a scale effect. So if I'm Honey Nut Cheerios and I know that people are going to buy lots of my Cheerios, I can I can build a big factory and not, you know, hand crank out each Cheerio. I'm going to have these compounding advantages just in terms of economies of scale, right? Like Amazon is that does that really have a network effect? No. It's like it's kind of nice that everything that I buy will show up the next day or in two days and how can they do that at low cost because so many people are buying things. So there are some things that have scale and those things also benefit from brand. So if you can move the fastest, right? So if you can elomerate capital and labor so it's like I raise the most money. It's a very very generic idea, but somehow like most other things on planet Earth, if it's the biggest and like really really big kind of gravitational scale, then it's just going to work better. So, can I get there the most quickly? But there are 20 companies that are doing the exact same thing. And at that point, I wouldn't say that momentum is a moat per se, but momentum has the highest chance of getting you to gravitational scale where you do have a moat. And if you don't do that, by contrast, you're just going to get eaten alive because you can't hand crank out the Cheerios. You you have to get to the scale where you're able to build a factory. And with the you have the biggest factory, you can crank out the most things at the lowest cost. So, what is the trajectory? What is the slope of you versus all of your competition? And if you have not a good slope, um you're you're just not going to win that game.</p>

我认为这个市场比以往任何时候都更加喧嚣，所以，我认为找到脱颖而出的方法在今天可能比过去更重要。我认为另一件事是底层技术变化如此之快。因此，作为一名创始人，你希望生活在前沿，了解模型能力是什么样的，因为它能够极大地改变你底层产品的效能或能力。

我认为，在当前这波垂直应用浪潮中，一个非常有趣的变化是创始人的类型。今天的创始人通常比前几代更年轻、更具技术背景。因此，他们不常是特定行业的“原生居民”，但他们精通工具集，我认为这非常重要，因为你必须保持在前沿，了解即将发生的事情。同时，我写过一篇文章，叫做“上下文为王”（Context is King）。虽然了解模型能力和前沿技术发展很重要，但你仍然需要弄清楚如何应用这项技术。因此，虽然创始人本身可能不那么“原生”于特定行业，但他们仍然在公司生命周期的早期就雇佣具有行业背景的人才。

我担任董事会成员的一家公司Eve就是一个很好的例子。Eve的两位创始人是Rubrik（一家现已上市的基础设施公司）最早的员工。他们建立了一家在原告律师领域的法律AI公司。他们两人都没有就业法或人身伤害方面的特定背景，但他们深刻理解如何将文档提取技术以及更广泛的语音和大型语言模型（LLMs）应用于这个非常特定的工作流程。他们实际上雇佣了原告律师作为员工。因此，每当有新模型发布时，他们都会从行业人士那里了解它对起草、对他们推理案件或事项能力的影响。所以，这又是一种张力：建立品牌、保持势头、了解前沿技术，同时还要弄清楚如何在特定客户的背景下应用这项技术，因为我深信，许多防御性的来源就存在于此。

我希望找到更多这样的商业案例，即技术能够强化其商业模式，而不是与之竞争。这意味着在法律的许多领域，如果你让你的员工效率提高50倍，你就会侵蚀你的“可计费工时”（billable hour: 律师或其他专业人士向客户收费的时间单位）。而在他们的业务中，他们是按“风险代理”（contingency basis: 律师在胜诉后才收取费用，通常按赔偿金的一定比例）运作的，这意味着他们只有在胜诉时才能获得报酬。因此，他们对采用AI的数量没有限制。如果你能提高5倍效率，你就能承接5倍的客户。这些都是我认为我希望找到更多的那种特征，希望这也能成为一个不好的信号。

我认为另一个“稻草人论证”（steelman: 指将对方的论点以最强、最合理的形式呈现，以便更好地反驳）是，如果你相信品牌很重要——这几乎是同义反复的，因为我买什么？我买我听说过的东西，对吧？所以这里有一个优势。如果你相信对于很多公司和产品来说，拥有规模是有效的，对吧？所以不是网络效应，而是规模效应。如果我是Honey Nut Cheerios，我知道人们会买很多我的麦片，我就可以建一个大工厂，而不是手工制作每一片麦片。我将拥有这些复合优势，仅仅是规模经济（economies of scale: 随着生产规模扩大，单位产品成本下降）。比如亚马逊，它真的有网络效应吗？不。它只是很好，我买的所有东西都会在第二天或两天内送达，他们如何以低成本做到这一点？因为有很多人在购买东西。所以有些东西具有规模，这些东西也受益于品牌。

如果你能行动最快，对吧？如果你能聚合资本和劳动力，就像我筹集了最多的钱一样。这是一个非常非常通用的想法，但不知何故，就像地球上大多数其他事物一样，如果它是最大的，并且具有非常非常大的引力规模，那么它就会运作得更好。所以，我能最快地达到那里吗？但有20家公司正在做完全相同的事情。在那一点上，我不会说势头本身就是护城河，但势头最有机会让你达到具有护城河的引力规模。如果你不这样做，相比之下，你就会被活活吞噬，因为你不能手工制作麦片。你必须达到能够建造工厂的规模。而如果你拥有最大的工厂，你就能以最低的成本生产最多的东西。所以，你的轨迹是什么？你与所有竞争对手的斜率是什么？如果你的斜率不好，你就赢不了这场比赛。

<p class="english-text">One of the questions for defensibility in in web two companies was hey would Google you know would those will they some someday build this or or Facebook or name your incumbent um in in the AI era it's will open AI or will will some other you know major company how should compan how should we think about that that framework in the AI era you know I mean it's funny I feel like 18 months ago this uh you know GP GPT rapper was on everybody's lips and I think it was it was largely used as a projorative you know, it's like and I think, you know, to some degree, I think there are some spaces where like the model capability and the application capability, if they're very overlapping, I think you're in a in a risky spot, you know. Um, but the reality is that there's so many I think one of the remarkable things that's happened is there's so many markets that were never particularly interesting to sell software into that are now radically interesting spaces to build companies in. Again, in large part because, you know, the market is now labor, not just IT spend. plaintiff law being an example, you know, uh, you know, Alex has we have a company called Salient in uh, applying voice agents to autoloan servicing. Five, six years ago, would we be backed a software company selling to, you know, non-bank auto lenders? Probably not. The company's doing incredibly well. Again, in large part because, you know, the capability of being able to, you know, uh speak in 50 languages, you know, fully compliantly, you know, with with customers in 50 states working 247, um, you know, is just so differentiated, you know, uh, versus the individual. And they're finding that their ability to collect is meaningfully higher, you know, than than that labor that the that the kind of costbenefit trade-off is so dramatic. the company is getting a lot of you know revenue from those customers who may not have had um you know millions of dollars of of IT budget historically and are now very willing to pay for a product like that you know given the impact on the business</p>

### AI时代下巨头与初创企业的竞争格局

在Web 2.0公司中，关于防御性的一个问题是：Google、Facebook或任何现有巨头会不会有一天自己构建这个产品？而在AI时代，这个问题变成了：OpenAI或其他主要公司会这样做吗？我们应该如何看待AI时代的这种框架？

有趣的是，大约18个月前，“GPT包装器”（GPT wrapper: 指在GPT等大型语言模型之上构建的简单应用或界面，通常功能有限，缺乏深度集成）这个词被大家挂在嘴边，而且在很大程度上被用作贬义词。我认为，在某种程度上，如果模型能力和应用能力高度重叠，那么你所处的境地会比较危险。但现实是，有如此多的市场，以前从未特别适合销售软件，但现在却成为了建立公司的极具吸引力的领域。这在很大程度上是因为，市场现在是劳动力，而不仅仅是IT支出。

原告律师（plaintiff law: 代表原告提起诉讼的法律领域）就是一个例子。我们有一家名为Salient的公司，将语音代理应用于汽车贷款服务。五六年前，我们会投资一家向非银行汽车贷款机构销售软件的公司吗？可能不会。但这家公司现在做得非常好。这在很大程度上是因为，能够以50种语言、完全合规地与50个州的客户进行24/7沟通的能力，与个人相比，是如此的差异化。他们发现，他们的收款能力显著高于人工，这种成本效益权衡是如此巨大。该公司从那些历史上可能没有数百万美元IT预算的客户那里获得了大量收入，而现在，考虑到对业务的影响，他们非常愿意为这样的产品付费。

<p class="english-text">and and the way that we used to talk about this a long time ago is uh and this almost had a porative slant to it but it's like are you building a feature a product or a company and what's the difference between the three well a feature is like there's an existing product and you tweak that product to make it marginally better a product is, you know, not that. It's like some hopefully system of record or something that keeps track of something and then uh a company is probably the most defensible of those three where you have a product and you know maybe you own a platform like the platforms tend to be the most valuable companies but you know a feature is like I've built a Chrome plugin and that doesn't mean and there by the way there were a lot of Chrome plugins like Honey was a Chrome plugin that got bought by four for for$4 billion like I wish I had done that right that's that's a good feature but that was a feature you know, a product would be like, "Oh, I built my own browser." And a company is like, "All right, well, like my own browser company actually makes money." Like, you don't actually have a company, even if you have 10 products, if you don't have a sustainable path to have that company be around in 10 or 20 years. Um, and I think kind of another way of thinking about what David just said is that now the features, like, you know, the feature was the most porative and seemingly small of all of those three almost obviously. some of the features can be incredibly profitable because it's like wait a minute like this it feels like a feature um because it could get added to Salesforce right or could get added to one of these other things but the amount of money that I can charge for my feature is like orders of magnitude more because it's like hey I'm going to be the front office receptionist for your you know orthodontic clinic like that's my job like that's my that's that's that's the feature and it sits on top of whatever software you currently use, but the feature I can now charge $20,000 a year for because it is doing the job of labor. But uh-oh, will the existing product that my feature is riding on top of, will they go build those those pieces of functionality andor will another company show up that just says, "Hey, we're going to sell the green field with a new product that kind of has this feature set embedded." and you know feature product company it still is out there but um I've just never seen a world where the features if you will can can get to revenue scale as quickly and by the way you you kind of often have to start with the feature because a customer isn't like think of it from the customer's perspective the customer being the business buyer of software it's like I know I want to be locked into a piece of uh software company for 20 years that's what I'm looking for as a buyer no it's like oo I have a problem to solve my problem is I can't hire a front office receptionist for my orthodontic clinic or I can't call people in Mandarin or Cantonese to go like repay their auto loans. Like what do I do? Oh, something shows up and it offers that functionality. Boom, I'm a buyer. And then that functionality has to that that feature has to backfill product, backfill company as quickly as possible. So that's still true today as it was 10 or 20 or 30 years ago. Um but the difference again is that the feature the the revenue for the feature is just so high and the demand for it is so high because again in many cases you're just responding to help wanted ads effectively.</p>

我们很久以前谈论这个问题的方式——这几乎带有一种贬义的色彩——是你在构建一个“功能”（feature）、一个“产品”（product）还是一个“公司”（company）？这三者之间有什么区别？一个功能就像是，有一个现有产品，你对它进行微调，使其略微更好。一个产品则不是那样。它更像是一个有望成为“记录系统”或某种跟踪事物的系统。而一个公司可能是这三者中最具防御性的，你拥有一个产品，也许你拥有一个平台，平台往往是最有价值的公司。但一个功能就像我开发了一个Chrome插件，这并不意味着……顺便说一下，有很多Chrome插件，比如Honey就是一个Chrome插件，它以40亿美元的价格被收购了。我希望我当时做了那个，那是一个很好的功能，但它只是一个功能。

一个产品会像“哦，我开发了自己的浏览器”。而一个公司会像“好吧，我的浏览器公司确实能赚钱”。即使你有10个产品，如果你没有一个可持续的路径让这家公司在10年或20年后依然存在，你实际上就没有一家公司。我认为，思考David刚才所说的另一种方式是，现在的功能——功能在所有这三者中是最具贬义且看似微不足道的——有些功能可以带来惊人的利润，因为你会觉得“等等，这感觉像一个功能”，因为它可能会被添加到Salesforce或添加到其他某个产品中。但我可以为我的功能收取的费用要高出几个数量级，因为这就像“嘿，我将成为你的牙科诊所的前台接待员”，这就是我的工作，这就是那个功能。它建立在你目前使用的任何软件之上，但我现在可以每年收取2万美元，因为它正在完成劳务工作。

但问题是，我的功能所依赖的现有产品，它们会去构建这些功能吗？或者会不会有另一家公司出现，直接说：“嘿，我们将用一个嵌入了这套功能的新产品来销售‘绿地’市场。”功能、产品、公司，这些概念仍然存在，但我从未见过一个世界，功能能够如此迅速地达到收入规模。顺便说一下，你通常必须从功能开始，因为客户——从软件的商业购买者的角度来看——客户不会说“我知道我希望被锁定在一家软件公司20年”，这不是他们作为购买者所寻找的。他们会说“哦，我有一个问题要解决，我的问题是我无法为我的牙科诊所雇佣前台接待员，或者我无法用普通话或粤语打电话给人们让他们偿还汽车贷款。我该怎么办？”哦，有东西出现了，它提供了这个功能。砰！我是一个购买者。然后，这个功能必须尽快地“回填”产品，“回填”公司。所以，这在今天仍然是真实的，就像10年、20年或30年前一样。但不同之处在于，功能带来的收入非常高，对其需求也非常高，因为在很多情况下，你实际上只是在回应招聘广告。

<p class="english-text">Yeah. And so I think the effect of that is that there's been sort of like a Cambrian explosion of interesting markets to go after you know I think it's unrealistic to believe that like OpenAI is going to go build you know the the the you know front office assistant for the you know the dental clinic like as their core you know kind of business. They're not going to do that across every single market. I think the other dynamic is that for many of these companies, part of the product value is actually orchestrating the work across lots of different model companies. And so I think having one, you know, uh, you know, foundation model business, you know, going kind of up the stack, I think limits the actual impact of the actual of the application, you know, potentially as well.</p>

### AI时代的“寒武纪大爆发”与平台公司的策略

我认为其结果是，出现了“寒武纪大爆发”（Cambrian explosion: 指生物多样性在短时间内迅速增加的时期，此处比喻市场机会的爆发式增长）般的有趣市场。我认为，指望OpenAI将其核心业务扩展到为牙科诊所构建前台助理是不现实的。他们不会在每个市场都这样做。我认为另一个动态是，对于许多公司来说，产品价值的一部分实际上是协调不同模型公司之间的工作。因此，我认为拥有一个基础模型业务，并试图向上游堆栈发展，可能会限制应用程序的实际影响。

<p class="english-text">Well, I think that, you know, if you kind of think about this versus other platform companies. Um, so Facebook was the pre-eminent platform company of of web 2.0. So call it from when whenever they opened up Facebook platform which I think it was like 2007. Um people built their businesses on top of Facebook. Facebook would never do those particular things. Like so Facebook is never going to show up and say hey you know what we should build a farming game. Like they were like no we're going to have a platform that allows companies like Zingga to build these farming games. But what the platform normally does if they don't actually go compete with the the underlying products is they say, "I'm going to tax it, but I'm going to tax it in ways that are kind of at my fancy. So this week it's 10% taxes. That's my promise. Oh, wait. I changed my mind. Now it's going to be 40% taxes." So that's why it's always dangerous to build on somebody else's platform. So I think the two things to look at are number one is will the platform owner compete with what I'm doing? Um, and that's also another Goldilock zone question, right? Because why is it I I published this graph of VisiCalc versus Lotus 123 versus Excel. So VisiCalc invented the spreadsheet in 1979 had 100% of the market because they were the only player in town. Lotus built a better version of that. Uh Lotus got to like I think 70% market share by 1985 which was when Microsoft released Excel for uh a Mac. Um and then by 2000 uh Microsoft had 96% market share. And why is it because they owned Windows? Like the the platform owner normally wins. So, but that's because it was just such a hu like why do I buy a computer in 1997 because I want to use a spreadsheet like it was just so intrinsically linked. Like that was one of the main use cases for computers and business use, right? It's like using spreadsheets. So that was like violator of Goldilock zone. Whereas other things where it's like all you have to worry about from the platform owner is that they're going to tax you, but they might tax you in very very bizarre ways. But uh part of what David was saying in terms of like there are multiple model companies, which is great. Like the problem with Windows was that it was like 95% of the market. Like 95% of your customers used Windows. So if I'm going to go build a competing spreadsheet, I'm just toast because the platform owner is just going to drown me. Um now there are five model companies or you know more like when you include all the Chinese models and whatnot open source like I don't have to worry about that. But I do have to worry about them saying, "Wow, this is so relevant." Like, why is it that OpenAI got a public company CEO to quit her job and just to become the CEO of of applications at OpenAI? Maybe because they have a huge application opportunity. But this is the nice thing is that a lot of these things are so obscure, but they're still big. But I don't think OpenAI is going to go do them because it's like, are they going to do like dental care management? like they they could, but if they've done that, then I would be short Open AI because it's like they've run out of good stuff to do.</p>
</details>

如果你将此与其他的平台公司进行比较。Facebook是Web 2.0时代最杰出的平台公司。从他们开放Facebook平台开始算起，大概是2007年。人们在Facebook之上建立了自己的业务。Facebook永远不会做那些特定的事情。比如，Facebook永远不会出现并说“嘿，我们应该开发一个农场游戏”。他们会说“不，我们将拥有一个平台，允许像Zynga这样的公司开发这些农场游戏”。但如果平台不与底层产品竞争，它通常会做什么呢？它会说：“我要征税，但我要以我喜欢的方式征税。所以这周是10%的税。这是我的承诺。哦，等等，我改变主意了。现在是40%的税。”所以，在别人的平台上构建东西总是很危险的。

因此，我认为需要关注两件事：第一，平台所有者会与我正在做的事情竞争吗？这也是一个“金发姑娘区”的问题，对吧？我曾发布过一张VisiCalc与Lotus 1-2-3与Excel的图表。VisiCalc在1979年发明了电子表格，拥有100%的市场份额，因为他们是唯一的玩家。Lotus构建了一个更好的版本。到1985年，Lotus的市场份额达到了70%，当时Microsoft发布了Mac版Excel。然后到2000年，Microsoft拥有了96%的市场份额。为什么呢？因为他们拥有Windows。平台所有者通常会赢。但那是因为它太巨大了，就像我为什么在1997年买电脑？因为我想用电子表格，它就是如此内在的联系。那是电脑和商业用途的主要用例之一，对吧？就像使用电子表格一样。所以那违反了“金发姑娘区”的原则。

而其他事情，你只需要担心平台所有者会向你征税，但他们可能会以非常奇怪的方式征税。但David所说的，有多个模型公司，这很棒。Windows的问题在于它占据了95%的市场。你95%的客户都使用Windows。所以如果我要去构建一个竞争性的电子表格，我就会完蛋，因为平台所有者会淹没我。现在有五家模型公司，或者更多，如果你把所有中国模型和开源模型都算进去的话，我不需要担心这个问题。但我确实需要担心他们会说：“哇，这太相关了。”比如，为什么OpenAI能让一家上市公司CEO辞职，只为了成为OpenAI的应用部门CEO？也许是因为他们有巨大的应用机会。但好的一点是，很多这些事情都非常小众，但它们仍然很大。但我认为OpenAI不会去做这些事情，因为他们会去做牙科管理吗？他们可以，但如果他们做了，那我就会做空OpenAI，因为这意味着他们已经没有好事情可做了。

<p class="english-text">Um, that's something that they should do in 2029. And then this is I think I told you this this story before. This is I I this changed my outlook on life when I pitched this guy Dan Rose at Facebook who was running business development there. I'm like, "This is a huge opportunity. You should use us for payments. We're going to do this. We can make so much money for Facebook." And he was so patient and nice and I I love this guy. I'm on a board with him to this day. He was like, "Alex, that's such a great idea." I was like, "All right, I got the deal." Yes. He said, "It's a great idea, but we're not going to do it because you're pitching me a go. Like, we have gold bricks all around us." Like, and he was right. I mean, like Facebook in 2010, I mean, how much money Facebook has grown their revenue pro? They they have more profit every quarter today than they had revenue per year in 2010. It's just such an incredible company. And he's like, "You're pitching me a gold brick that's like 100 feet away." And it's real. like I love that gold brick, but we have like hundreds of gold bricks where I just have to like stoop down at my feet and pick them up. So, I'm just not going to do that one right there. And that's how these big companies think. Um but the nice thing is that these are gold brick. These gold bricks are bigger than they've ever been because you have software that can do the job of labor.</p>

### 巨头公司的“金砖”思维

那是他们应该在2029年做的事情。我想我以前给你讲过这个故事。这改变了我的人生观，当时我向Facebook负责业务发展的**Dan Rose**推销时，我说：“这是一个巨大的机会。你们应该用我们的支付服务。我们会这样做。我们可以为Facebook赚很多钱。”他非常耐心和友善，我至今仍和他一起在董事会。他说：“Alex，那真是个好主意。”我当时想：“好吧，我拿到这笔交易了。”是的。他说：“这是个好主意，但我们不会做，因为你给我推销的是一个‘金砖’。我们周围到处都是‘金砖’。”他是对的。Facebook在2010年，他们的收入增长了多少？他们今天每个季度的利润都比2010年全年的收入还要多。这真是一家了不起的公司。他说：“你给我推销的是一块100英尺外的金砖。”它是真实的，我喜欢那块金砖，但我们有数百块金砖，我只需要弯下腰就能捡起来。所以，我不会去做那一个。这就是这些大公司的思维方式。但好的一点是，这些“金砖”比以往任何时候都大，因为你有了能够完成劳务工作的软件。

### OpenAI的“金砖”选择：平台与水平应用

嗯，就此而言，如果你是OpenAI的负责人，你会考虑哪些“金砖”，或者你用什么心智模型来思考哪些事情应该优先做，哪些事情可以交给别人做？你会如何思考这个问题？

<p class="english-text">I mean I think a lot of it is where well it's it's two things. Number one is we want to be the backend for everybody like the platform. I think it's two things. Number one is can we be the platform for pretty much everybody who's building anything. So, we're not going to go in these into these obscure spaces like, you know, orthodontic care, uh, at least not until, you know, 2045. So, let's make sure that every single developer is using us. Um, and this is part of why Microsoft crushed Apple in the 1980s because Apple made it really hard to develop software. Um, and what's actually kind of interesting is that both Apple and Microsoft um, had like Microsoft started off as a compiler company. Like their very very first products, they were not Microsoft Office, it was not DOSs. They built a basic interpreter um for the programming language basic and they had a big business. Their their biggest competitor was Borland um which only made compilers and like the early rallying cry if you talk to any early Microsoft employee was beat Philippe. Philippe Khan was the CEO of Borland. So Microsoft was focused on that made a lot of money on that and Apple was like we should make money on that too and they had a product it was called MPW uh Macintosh programmers workshop. I remember I used to use it in the 1980s and uh it was like $2,000 I think in 1980s money to buy this you know IDE or you know programming uh thing and uh it's like how do you afford that? So like but it was like we have to make money on that. Microsoft's making money on this and then lo and behold there were like 10,000 times more you know DOSs and Windows software products than there were Macintosh software products. And of course, Apple corrected that mistake when the iPhone came out when they now like Xcode, which is the way that you build products for um for Mac products or Macintosh and and iPhone iOS, it's free. So like they they kind of corrected that mistake. Um but I'd say two things to answer your question. Number one is can we be the biggest consumer brand in the world? So Chat GBT has 800 million weekly active users. Like get that to five billion, right? Like is even if Gem Gemini 3 came out today, it might be five times better. But are people that are using chat GPT just as consumers, are they going to switch? Like maybe, but it's unlikely just because they kind of make that their their default and then be the backend for everybody who's building anything. And that way it's like kind of all the gold bricks kind of come to you. I think the other uh thing that we should anticipate, we're already beginning to see from some of these big model companies are like what are the big horizontal applications that they can likely sell to every you know large enterprise. And I think you know you saw today with you know Google's uh anti-gravity launch like the ID is going to be one of those things. I think like that you know if there's like product market fit for for LMS like you know coding is definitely you know one of the top categories. Um so I think that you know thinking about what are the big horizontal kind of applications in the enterprise. I think there's also to some degree and you know we'll I think this has been earlier to sort of play out. It's sort of the palunteer opportunity. I think we're still very early in in sort of the proliferation of this technology into large enterprise. Um at the same time you know unlike prior product cycles you know you know like the cloud if I'm the CEO of a large public company and I'm asking myself do I need to be in the cloud? It was sort of an esoteric idea. you know, today I can plug a, you know, prompt into any one of these models and intuitively understand the impact that it could have on my business, right? The the efficiency gains in my customer support organization, in my engineering organization, in all of my back office functions. At the same time, many of them don't know where to start. And so I think you will see sort of this consultative sort of forward deployed palunteer-esque sort of sale into very large enterprise from some of these, you know, big model companies. Again, I think we're early in that, but you've you've heard inklings of this with um you know, with Enthropic talking about wanting to build into financial services and and other markets. So, you know, I agree. I think the biggest opportunities are the one that Alex is describing, but I think you will see them selectively, you know, try to build kind of applications that cut cut across every one of those and then they'll probably choose, you know, a few sort of like lighthouse customers to build, you know, largely bespoke kind of custom integrations into these, you know, bigger enterprises. But where are the ACBs, you know, just really make sense.</p>

我认为这主要有两点。第一，我们希望成为所有人的后端，就像平台一样。所以，我们不会进入牙科护理等这些小众领域，至少在2045年之前不会。所以，我们要确保每一个开发者都在使用我们。这就是为什么Microsoft在20世纪80年代击败了Apple，因为Apple让软件开发变得非常困难。有趣的是，Apple和Microsoft都曾是编译器公司。Microsoft最初的产品不是Microsoft Office，也不是DOS，他们为BASIC编程语言开发了一个BASIC解释器，并拥有庞大的业务。他们最大的竞争对手是Borland，Borland只生产编译器。如果你和任何早期的Microsoft员工交谈，他们早期的口号就是“打败Philippe”（Philippe Khan是Borland的CEO）。所以Microsoft专注于此并赚了很多钱。Apple也想从中赚钱，他们有一个产品叫做MPW（Macintosh Programmers Workshop）。我记得我在20世纪80年代用过它，当时购买这个集成开发环境（IDE: Integrated Development Environment，集成开发环境）或编程工具需要2000美元。你怎么能负担得起呢？但他们觉得必须从中赚钱。Microsoft正在赚钱，结果DOS和Windows软件产品比Macintosh软件产品多了一万倍。当然，Apple在iPhone问世后纠正了这个错误，现在Xcode（用于为Mac产品、Macintosh和iPhone iOS开发产品的方式）是免费的。所以他们纠正了这个错误。

但要回答你的问题，我会说两件事。第一，我们能否成为世界上最大的消费品牌？ChatGPT拥有8亿周活跃用户。让它达到50亿，对吧？即使今天Gemini Flash（Gemini 3）问世，它可能好五倍。但作为消费者使用ChatGPT的人会切换吗？也许会，但不太可能，因为他们已经习惯了将其作为默认选择。然后，成为所有构建任何东西的人的后端。这样一来，所有的“金砖”都会向你涌来。

我认为我们应该预期的另一件事，也是我们已经开始从一些大型模型公司那里看到的，是它们可以向每个大型企业销售的“大型水平应用”（horizontal applications: 指可以应用于多个行业或业务领域的通用型软件）。我认为，就像你今天看到的Google的“反重力”发布（anti-gravity launch: 可能指Google在AI领域推出的具有颠覆性、改变行业格局的产品或服务，如Gemini等），ID将是其中之一。我认为，如果大型语言模型（LLMs）有产品市场契合度，那么编码无疑是顶级类别之一。所以，我认为要思考企业中大型水平应用是什么。

我认为在某种程度上，这也是Palantir的机会。我认为我们仍处于这项技术向大型企业普及的早期阶段。同时，与之前的产品周期不同，比如云计算，如果我是一家大型上市公司的CEO，我问自己是否需要上云？那是一个有点深奥的想法。而今天，我可以将一个提示词插入到任何一个模型中，直观地理解它可能对我的业务产生的影响，对吧？我的客户支持部门、工程部门以及所有后台功能的效率提升。同时，他们中的许多人不知道从何开始。因此，我认为你会看到一些大型模型公司向大型企业进行这种咨询式的、前置部署的Palantir式的销售。再次，我认为我们仍处于早期阶段，但你已经听到了一些迹象，比如Anthropic谈论希望进入金融服务和其他市场。所以，我同意Alex所描述的，最大的机会就在那里，但我认为你会看到他们有选择性地尝试构建能够跨越所有这些领域的应用程序，然后他们可能会选择一些“灯塔客户”（lighthouse customers: 指那些具有行业影响力，能够为新产品或服务树立榜样并吸引更多客户的早期采用者），为这些大型企业构建高度定制化的集成方案。但那些投资回报率（ACB: Average Cost Basis，平均成本基础，此处可能指投资回报率或客户获取成本）真正有意义的地方在哪里呢？

<p class="english-text">In in in web two, there was a lot of winner takemost. Um, you were talking about one of the benefits in AI is that there's multiple winners. To to what extent is is consolidation in in inevitable or how do you think sort of this this plays out? Well, I think if you have 20 companies that are all doing the same thing, um, what has historically happened is that it's a bad market if there are 20 companies doing it, but then I don't know, the bottom 15 just go bankrupt. Um, and then maybe there's some consolidation where number one buys number two, number two buys number three, and assuming that we have a functional FTC and whatnot, it's like all of this is approved because it's not like you're taking this is like orthodontic clinic answering software or something. Um so and then what was a bad market becomes a good market. Um and this kind of goes back to like why momentum is important because if you have 20 companies that are all at the exact same scale um then it's actually great for the customer which is like the the prices go to zero um or they converge on the price of electricity. Whereas if you this is not saying you want to go build a monopoly in orthodontic answering software or something but rather you can charge more if you get to a certain scale because whatever the the quality of the product that you're delivering at the end of the day is just higher um and you have to get to the critical scale to get there and sometimes you just need these markets to to work themselves out. I mean like when I was running my company trial pay we had I don't know 20 competitors and it was tough because it's like you know um everybody would be pricing their product at a loss you know this this loss leader only works if you end up leading with like you have to make money at the end and nobody really had a plan for that because the venture capital dollars were really subsidizing everything and that does not get a good market. what does become a good market at the end and sometimes this is what you know Vista the private equity firm would do is like we're going to buy one as our anchor we're going to go lowball um and put the other five out of their misery and now we end up with actually a pretty good product at the end or a pretty good business at the end pretty good company at the end so I think that will probably play out the same way here because you just can't have a market where you have everybody lossle leading um and nobody's big enough to get any kind of scale effects um is there going to be a world where the the 19th player survives. I mean, Jack Welch uh would always say you have to be number one or number two and there's no value to being number three through 100. I don't think that's changed.</p>

### 市场整合与“赢家通吃”的演变

在Web 2.0时代，存在很多“赢家通吃”（winner-take-most）的情况。你提到AI的一个好处是会有多个赢家。那么，市场整合在多大程度上是不可避免的，或者你认为这种情况会如何发展？

我认为，如果20家公司都在做同样的事情，历史上发生的情况是，如果20家公司都在做，那是一个糟糕的市场，但随后，我不知道，底部15家就破产了。然后可能会有一些整合，第一名收购第二名，第二名收购第三名。假设我们有一个运作正常的联邦贸易委员会（FTC: Federal Trade Commission，美国联邦贸易委员会）等等，所有这些都会被批准，因为它不像你正在接管牙科诊所应答软件之类的东西。所以，一个糟糕的市场就会变成一个好市场。这又回到了为什么势头很重要，因为如果20家公司都处于完全相同的规模，那么这对客户来说实际上是好事，因为价格会趋近于零，或者它们会趋同于电费的价格。

然而，这并不是说你想要在牙科应答软件或其他领域建立垄断，而是如果你达到了一定的规模，你就可以收取更高的费用，因为你最终提供的产品质量更高。你必须达到关键规模才能实现这一点，有时你只需要让这些市场自行发展。比如，当我经营我的公司TrialPay时，我们有大约20个竞争对手，这很艰难，因为每个人都会以亏损的价格销售他们的产品。这种“亏损领先”（loss leader: 指以低价甚至亏本销售某产品以吸引顾客，从而带动其他产品销售）只有在你最终能够盈利的情况下才有效，但没有人真正为此制定计划，因为风险投资的资金实际上补贴了一切，而这并不能带来一个好的市场。

最终会成为一个好市场的是什么？有时，像Vista（Vista Equity Partners: 一家专注于软件、数据和科技驱动型企业的私募股权公司）这样的私募股权公司会这样做：我们将收购一家作为我们的核心公司，然后以低价收购其他五家，让它们摆脱困境，最终我们得到一个相当不错的产品，一个相当不错的业务，一个相当不错的公司。所以我认为这里的情况可能也会以同样的方式发展，因为你不可能有一个市场，每个人都在亏损领先，而且没有人足够大以获得任何规模效应。会有第19名玩家生存下来的世界吗？**杰克·韦尔奇**（Jack Welch: 曾任通用电气GE的CEO，以其管理理念闻名）总是说，你必须是第一名或第二名，第三名到第一百名都没有价值。我认为这一点没有改变。

<p class="english-text">Right. Right. Even in the model provider example and I'm also curious if prices go down. Yeah. I I don't I don't see how like there actually are I mean people know XAI, Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, like they they know or Quen um they they know the big ones but there are actually there's a long tale of things that people haven't heard of um where it's like they've raised lots of money. It's just like not it it's it works fine, but how can you surv like the model company is the most cutthroat because like unless you're state if you're state-of-the-art minus minus minus and you're trying to earn a living, it's just like that that's just not going to work. So that game is super cutthroat. I think I think the one area where that um may have diverged and Martine talks about this a lot is like um you know when markets are growing so quickly you you end up having specialization and so I think in other kind of modalities you know in in some of the creative tools or you know people have specialized to like serve you know the up market you know like I'm I'm producing you know movies okay I want to create sort of like social you know quality content like these are different you know markets that that the models can kind of specialize in time will tell you know how sort of uh you defensible those become over time. But um maybe that's the optimistic take that like you know early on everything looks you know overlapping and competitive but we're still so you know the market is growing that everything can kind of expand and people can kind of specialize over time.</p>
</details>

### 模型提供商的竞争与专业化

即使在模型提供商的例子中，我也好奇价格是否会下降。我不知道这会如何发生。实际上，人们知道XAI、Anthropic、OpenAI、Gemini，或者Cohere，他们知道这些大公司，但实际上还有很多人们从未听说过的公司，它们也筹集了很多资金。它们运作良好，但你如何生存下来？模型公司是最残酷的，因为如果你不是最先进的，而且你还在努力谋生，那根本行不通。所以这场游戏非常残酷。

我认为有一个领域可能有所不同，Martine经常谈到这一点，那就是当市场增长如此之快时，你最终会出现专业化。所以，我认为在其他一些模式中，比如在一些创意工具中，人们已经专业化以服务高端市场。比如，我正在制作电影，我想创作一些社交性的高质量内容，这些都是模型可以专业化的不同市场。时间会证明这些市场随着时间的推移会变得多么具有防御性。但这也许是一种乐观的看法，即早期一切看起来都是重叠和竞争的，但我们仍然如此，市场正在增长，一切都可以扩展，人们可以随着时间的推移进行专业化。

<p class="english-text">Earlier when you were talking about the feature versus product didn't Steve Jobs once tell Drew Hston that Dropbox was was just a feature. Yeah. I mean that that's why it's always been this porative thing but that's that's kind of the point that I was getting to is that nobody wants to like oh I need this company. No, it's like I need this feature. Um, every now and then you see a product that is not a feature because it's just like so far out of left field. Like nobody was anticipating chat GPT dominating their daily workflow in 2022 in October. Um, but then once it came out, it was this like, holy crap, I this is incredible. And that's not a feature. You could argue it's a feature on top of your iPhone, but no, the iPhone is the delivery mechanism. That's a that's a product. Um, and they they've obviously turned that into a company. Whereas other things it kind of is like, you know, why is there anti virus software? That almost doesn't make any sense. Like, shouldn't the operating system stop you from getting viruses? Like, why do you need a third party tool to do synchronization between devices? But it turns out like the reason why Dropbox has survived and thrived since Steve Jobs made that comment is like it's really hard to do well. Um, and there's a lot of other things like once you've built that feature, you can backfill with all sorts of other product, which is what Dropbox has done a pretty good job of, but it is hard because this is the the danger of building on somebody else's platform is that, you know, I'm going to build this thing that they should have had, right, if they had the foresight. Um, and if it doesn't operate in the Goldilock zone, right, it's like, wow, this is so this will like triple Apple's profits. Let's just say that Dropbox would have tripled Apple's profits. Would they have dropped every would they have focused on building that versus the iPad or something, whatever like Steve's last gizmo was, like sure. But if it's kind of in this like Goldilock zone of irrelevance like janitorial services, it's like yeah, they should do that. But, you know, platform owners get lazy. Um, this is why like, you know, half the things on my iPhone don't really work if they're built by Apple. um try like any any parent that's listening to this if they've tried screen time it's just like an embarrassment upon humanity and because they don't have to go sell as a it's like they don't have to compete on feature they compete on the fact they don't even compete they just like they're the platform they roll it out it's going to be bad and that does create an opportunity for somebody to come up with the feature and actually out compete the um the platform but like you have to be careful because it's like obviously the platform owner is going to go compete with you and that's why often what I find very compelling about entrepreneurs when they know this like they've studied how is it that from every single platform shift from like you know we were talking about AC versus DC current like there have always been these battles for like who's going to be the underlying you know layer um the best entrepreneurs have studied this and they have a plan they're like I know I have a feature like Drew knew this he's like I know that like there's this stupid comment on Hacker News it's like oh this is just like our sync with this that and the other thing it's like yeah of course Drew knows that but he built this into a $10 billion company because like he had a plan and the best entrepreneurs they often like okay I know it's not this naive it's like oh I'm going to build this there's no way that they're going to build it because they're too dumb and stupid it's like no they're not like these companies if they get their act together they will marshall a lot of resources to go compete with you it might take them 5 years but they will 100% do it you have to backfill your feature with a product and you have to have a moat for that product as opposed to like oh yeah like the big company will never figure this out it's like that's not True. I I think what's also unique, I I wrote this piece a while ago called the messy inbox problem and [snorts] it was sort of a wedge strategy that we've been observing across lots of different industries and it's just this idea that um you hook into a bunch of your different unstructured data sources. Could be email, could be fax, could be phone. Um you know, Tenor as an example has trained a model to be able to extract all the relevant patient information from those data sources to plug it downstream into some system of record. in their case in EHR, but this exists in a CRM, an ERP, um, what have you. And I think that that wedge for that feature is interesting in large part because it lives upfunnel from software, right? You're replacing the kind of human level judgment of the individual. Like often that ad, you know, the secretary sort of like collecting the physical facts and then plugging it into the HR. And so now a bunch of AI companies can kind of, you know, wedge in and then eat away at all the downstream workflows that might have been their point solution software companies. And so, you know, Tener is no longer just doing, you know, the messy inbox. They're now doing scheduling and prior, you know, uh, prior and eligibility benefits. Um, and they've used that wedge to try to become, you know, kind of the endtoend platform. Eventually, maybe they become the system of record. Um but again because you can kind of replace the human labor now with software um I think it's creating opportunities for these you know features to actually become products and you know in in their case I think become you know whole companies. Well, I think I think this is the thing that in my mind is very dramatically different than every other platform shift is that the the it is just so consensus like cloud was not consensus, mobile was not consensus and that's why the incumbents kind of screwed up where it's like and then sometimes it was just like completely um I'll use the the Silicon Valley term orthogonal to their to their business model because it's like I sell $5 million a year products and wait a minute I'm going to charge $100,000 a month. like that's just hard like how do I pay my sales people? How do I make my quarterly numbers? So that's why like you know workday beat peopleoft um or that's why you know Salesforce beat Sevil. Um so all of these things played out but behind it was this concept of it's like that new thing that iPhone is stupid. Um like there's no version of the the famous Steve Ballmer clip of like him saying this nobody's going to buy an $800 phone with no keyboard. Um there's no version of that for AI. It's like how do you find a big CEO or even a small CEO is like nobody will use that tool that makes you a hundred times more productive of of course and this is why it's it's kind of a bonanza for most of the incumbents as well because anybody who has a system of record will add a button or a feature to use our parlance that will make them more money. Um so like they're just kind of gold bricks everywhere. And the challenge though is that there isn't this this kind of white space to occupy in the same way that there was for cloud or for mobile or for a lot of the web 2.0 things where it's like you just like the incumbents screwed up. They weren't paying attention. They scoff at this new technology. Like nobody's scoffing at this new technology. Like everybody's just trying to embrace it. But, you know, the opportunity often exists where a lot of the areas that just seem too small that don't have an incumbent at all. Like those actually might turn out to be like, you know, trillions of dollars of value. And that's kind of what makes it much more exciting than like last gen where it's like, oh, I'm just going to copy everything that was on prem and make it, you know, recurring billing cloud and I'm going to do that at a time when like the big guys say that's stupid and I don't get it. So some argue that you know mobile was was ultimately sustaining and that although there were you know net new companies and use cases that were you know hundred billion dollars like Uber and Airbnb etc that uh you know the incumbents you know some of them became trillion dollar companies you know guided by mobile when we look at the you know business impact of of the AI era um what's your mental model for thinking about sort of the incumbent startup or kind of net new company in terms of you know value capture</p>

### 功能、产品、公司：Dropbox与平台所有者的博弈

你之前谈到功能与产品时，**史蒂夫·乔布斯**（Steve Jobs: 苹果公司联合创始人）不是曾告诉**德鲁·休斯顿**（Drew Houston: Dropbox创始人）Dropbox只是一个功能吗？是的，我的意思是，这就是为什么它一直是一个贬义词，但这就是我想要表达的观点：没有人会说“哦，我需要这家公司”。不，他们会说“我需要这个功能”。

偶尔你会看到一个不是功能的产品，因为它太出人意料了。比如，在2022年10月，没有人预料到ChatGPT会主导他们的日常工作流程。但一旦它问世，人们就会觉得“天哪，这太不可思议了”。那不是一个功能。你可能会说它是iPhone上的一个功能，但不是，iPhone是交付机制。那是一个产品。他们显然已经把它变成了一家公司。而其他一些事情，就像“为什么会有杀毒软件？”这几乎没有意义。操作系统不应该阻止你感染病毒吗？为什么你需要第三方工具在设备之间进行同步？但事实证明，Dropbox之所以能在史蒂夫·乔布斯发表那番评论后生存和发展，是因为它真的很难做好。

还有很多其他事情，一旦你构建了那个功能，你可以用各种其他产品来“回填”，这也是Dropbox做得很好的地方。但这很难，因为在别人的平台上构建东西的危险在于，你会构建一个他们本应拥有的东西，如果他们有远见的话。如果它不在“金发姑娘区”内，你会觉得“哇，这太棒了，这会使苹果的利润翻三倍”。假设Dropbox会使苹果的利润翻三倍，他们会放弃一切，专注于构建它，而不是iPad或其他史蒂夫的最新小发明吗？当然会。但如果它处于像清洁服务那样“无关紧要的金发姑娘区”，他们会觉得“是的，他们应该做那个”。但平台所有者会变得懒惰。这就是为什么我iPhone上有一半的东西如果是由Apple自己开发的，就根本不好用。任何听这个节目的父母，如果他们试过“屏幕使用时间”（Screen Time: 苹果设备上的家长控制功能），那简直是人类的耻辱，因为他们不需要作为产品去销售，他们不需要在功能上竞争，他们甚至不竞争，他们只是作为平台推出它，它会很糟糕。

这确实为一些人创造了机会，让他们提出功能并真正超越平台。但你必须小心，因为平台所有者显然会与你竞争。这就是为什么我发现创业者知道这一点时非常引人注目，他们研究过每一次平台转变，比如我们谈论交流电与直流电，总是有关于谁将成为底层平台的争夺战。最优秀的创业者研究过这一点，他们有计划。他们会说“我知道我有一个功能”。就像Drew知道这一点一样，他说“我知道Hacker News上有一个愚蠢的评论，说这就像我们的同步功能加上其他东西一样”。是的，Drew当然知道，但他把它打造成了一家100亿美元的公司，因为他有计划。最优秀的创业者通常会说“我知道这不像那么天真，说‘哦，我要构建这个，他们不可能构建它，因为他们太笨太蠢了’”。不，他们不是。这些公司如果认真起来，他们会调动大量资源来与你竞争。这可能需要他们5年时间，但他们百分之百会这样做。你必须用一个产品来“回填”你的功能，并且你必须为那个产品建立护城河，而不是说“哦，大公司永远不会弄明白这个”。这不是真的。

我认为另一个独特之处，我很久以前写过一篇名为“凌乱的收件箱问题”（messy inbox problem）的文章，它是一种我们观察到在许多不同行业中存在的“楔子策略”（wedge strategy: 指通过一个小的、特定的功能或产品切入市场，然后逐渐扩展，侵蚀现有市场）。它的核心思想是，你连接到各种非结构化数据源，可以是电子邮件、传真、电话。例如，Tener公司训练了一个模型，能够从这些数据源中提取所有相关的患者信息，并将其下游插入到某个“记录系统”中。在他们的情况下是EHR，但这也存在于客户关系管理系统（CRM）、企业资源规划系统（ERP）等。我认为这个功能的“楔子”之所以有趣，很大程度上是因为它位于软件的上游，对吧？你正在取代个人的那种人类层面的判断。就像通常是秘书收集物理事实，然后将其输入到人力资源系统中。所以现在，许多AI公司可以“楔入”，然后蚕食所有下游工作流程，这些工作流程可能曾是他们的“点解决方案”软件公司。所以，Tener不再仅仅处理“凌乱的收件箱”，他们现在还在进行日程安排和之前的资格福利。他们利用这个“楔子”试图成为端到端平台。最终，他们可能会成为“记录系统”。但再次，因为你现在可以用软件取代人工劳动力，我认为这为这些功能创造了机会，使它们真正成为产品，并且在他们的情况下，我认为成为整个公司。

我认为，在我看来，这与所有其他平台转变都截然不同的是，它太具有共识性了。云计算不是共识，移动也不是共识，这就是为什么现有企业搞砸了。有时它与他们的商业模式完全“正交”（orthogonal: 指两个事物相互独立，互不影响），因为他们销售每年500万美元的产品，而现在却要每月收取10万美元。这很难，我怎么支付我的销售人员？我怎么完成我的季度业绩？这就是为什么Workday击败了PeopleSoft，或者Salesforce击败了Siebel。所有这些都发生了，但其背后是这样一个概念：iPhone是愚蠢的新事物。没有像**史蒂夫·鲍尔默**（Steve Ballmer: 曾任微软CEO）那个著名视频中说“没有人会买一个没有键盘的800美元手机”那样的AI版本。你找不到一个大公司CEO，甚至一个小公司CEO会说“没有人会使用那个能让你生产力提高一百倍的工具”。当然，这就是为什么这对大多数现有企业来说也是一场盛宴，因为任何拥有“记录系统”的公司都会添加一个按钮或一个功能，用我们的话说，这将使他们赚更多的钱。所以，到处都是“金砖”。

然而，挑战在于，不像云计算、移动或许多Web 2.0时代那样，没有这种可以占据的“空白空间”，当时现有企业搞砸了。他们没有注意。他们嘲笑这项新技术。现在没有人嘲笑这项新技术。每个人都只是在努力拥抱它。但机会通常存在于许多看起来太小，根本没有现有企业的领域。这些领域实际上可能会产生数万亿美元的价值。这就是它比上一代更令人兴奋的原因，上一代就像“哦，我只是要复制所有本地部署的东西，并将其变成循环计费的云服务”，而且是在那些大公司说“那很蠢，我不懂”的时候做的。所以有人认为，移动最终是可持续的，尽管出现了像Uber和Airbnb这样价值数千亿美元的新公司和用例，但现有企业中有些在移动的引导下成为了万亿美元公司。当我们审视AI时代的商业影响时，你对现有企业、初创企业或全新公司在价值捕获方面的心智模型是什么？

<p class="english-text">I I I think a lot of it is the same like unless you really screw up the the pricing model or like you know you're all per seat pricing it's very very hard to just get the market to adopt something that is just violently different and you're operating in the public eye and your technology team is bad there there are a lot of ants that need to happen I have a hard time believing that incumbents will really suffer um I mean there probably are some things like you know take take like one example of and this kind of goes back to distribution versus technology like all of these business process outsourcing companies these BPOS they're the largest employers on the planet. So like Tata, Whipro, Infosys. So if I'm JP Morgan and I say I need a call center and this call center needs to have access to like customer records and it needs to be safe and everybody needs to be trained like and I need to have like a 100,000 people that can answer the phone. You know who can do that for you? Infosys, right? Or Tata. Um Tata has already done the integration with JP Morgan in this case. they might just add AI and now they don't need a h 100red thousand people and they maintain that JP Morgan contract and they operate in the the area of the Goldilock zone where it's like they're going to make like a hundred times more money. That that's one case. That's the bull case for Tata. The bare case is like JP Morgan's like wait a minute like we should partner with the startup to do this or we should do this ourselves and now like Tata loses that relationship altogether. And it could go either direction. Like you I think a lot of these things are really up for grabs. But I I think the the default is that the incumbents probably will do well. But you can pick a lot of these cases. I mean this is why you see the public markets kind of don't know what to do where there is a case that is very very bad for a lot of software companies. But there's an alternative case which is like if you operate in the right goldilock zone um and you're you know you have the right momentum to actually build these things and embrace these new technologies like you'll maintain all of your customer relationships um and you're just going to have a more profitable business and it's not that you're going to do this like the the most compelling thing I think about AI that almost everybody gets wrong is like oh it's going to destroy all the jobs like our our beloved representative uh from Silicon Valley is like trying to like eliminate AI that's just so crazy that our elected representative wants to turn us back to farmers of of tangerines and whatnot in in Silicon Valley, but um which which again I think is crazy, but [snorts] uh it's not like all the jobs will go away. I actually think that's not going to happen at all. What's going to happen is there are a lot of things where it's like if I could hire somebody for a dollar to do this task, I would 100% do that. I cannot hire somebody for a dollar. I've never been able to hire somebody for a dollar. Now I can hire software for a dollar. So a lot of these tasks like you know look at how many people took taxis post Uber right and it's like did you hear people say like you probably took an Uber to get here today right would you have taken a taxi 20 years ago like no way right because it's like where would you find the taxi how would you arrange the tax it's just like way too complicated whereas once you make it very very abundant and less expensive like everybody's going to use this and I think that's the that's what Ro Kana and and his ilk are missing which is it's not like oh I'm going to go and say, "I'm going to like eliminate all the jobs." Like, think of it in that JP Morgan example that I just mentioned. It's like, wouldn't it be cool if every single customer of JP Morgan Chase could have their own personal friend that they could talk to every single day there that would help them with every single element of their financial life? Or it's like, I'm stuck downloading the app. I can't figure out how to get it set up. Oh, talk to somebody in real time that will help you about that. Why don't they do that? It's just like the cost is known. It's high. And then the value is probably low. And as soon as you can bring the cost down to zero, now you're going to start hiring AI in all of these different areas that you just would never bother hiring a human for because it's just like you can't train the human, you can't find the human, and the human's too expensive.</p>

### AI时代下就业与价值创造的重塑

我认为很多情况都是一样的，除非你真的搞砸了定价模型，或者你完全是按席位定价，否则市场很难接受一个截然不同的东西，而且你又在公众视野下运营，你的技术团队也很糟糕，需要发生很多“蚂蚁事件”（ants that need to happen: 指需要很多小而具体的条件或事件才能促成某个结果）。我很难相信现有企业会真正遭受损失。

我的意思是，可能有一些事情，比如以**业务流程外包**（BPO: Business Process Outsourcing，将非核心业务流程外包给第三方服务提供商）公司为例，这又回到了分销与技术的问题。所有这些BPO公司都是地球上最大的雇主。比如Tata Consultancy Services、Wipro、Infosys。所以如果我是JPMorgan，我说我需要一个呼叫中心，这个呼叫中心需要访问客户记录，需要安全，每个人都需要经过培训，而且我需要10万人能够接听电话。你知道谁能为你做到吗？Infosys，对吧？或者Tata。在这种情况下，Tata已经完成了与JPMorgan的集成。他们可能只是添加AI，现在他们不需要10万人，他们保持了与JPMorgan的合同，并且在“金发姑娘区”运营，他们将赚取一百倍的钱。这是一个案例，这是Tata的看涨情况。看跌情况是JPMorgan会说“等等，我们应该与初创公司合作来做这件事，或者我们应该自己做”，现在Tata完全失去了这种关系。这两种情况都可能发生。我认为很多事情都悬而未决。但我认为默认情况是现有企业可能会做得很好。

但你可以选择很多这样的案例。这就是为什么你会看到公开市场有点不知所措，因为有一种情况对很多软件公司来说非常非常糟糕。但还有另一种情况，那就是如果你在正确的“金发姑娘区”运营，并且你有足够的势头来实际构建这些东西并拥抱这些新技术，那么你将保持所有客户关系，而且你的业务将更加盈利。这并不是说你会这样做，我认为关于AI最引人注目但几乎每个人都理解错误的一点是，它会摧毁所有工作。比如我们硅谷受人爱戴的代表**罗·卡纳**（Ro Khanna: 美国国会议员，以对科技和经济政策的关注而闻名）试图消除AI，这太疯狂了，我们的民选代表竟然想让我们回到硅谷种植橘子之类的农民时代。这再次，我认为是疯狂的。

所有工作都不会消失。我实际上认为这根本不会发生。将会发生的是，有很多事情，如果我能以一美元的价格雇人完成这项任务，我百分之百会这样做。我无法以一美元雇到人。我从未能够以一美元雇到人。现在，我可以用一美元“雇佣”软件。所以，很多这些任务，比如看看Uber之后有多少人乘坐出租车，对吧？你会听到人们说，你今天可能乘坐Uber来到这里，对吧？你20年前会乘坐出租车吗？不可能，对吧？因为你会在哪里找到出租车？你怎么安排出租车？这太复杂了。然而，一旦你让它变得非常非常丰富且便宜，每个人都会使用它。我认为这就是罗·卡纳和他的同类人所忽视的，那就是它不像“哦，我要去说，我要消除所有工作”。想想我刚才提到的JPMorgan的例子。如果JPMorgan Chase的每一个客户都能拥有自己的私人朋友，每天都可以和他们交谈，帮助他们解决金融生活中的每一个问题，那岂不是很酷？或者，我卡在下载应用程序上，我不知道如何设置。哦，与一个能实时帮助你的人交谈。他们为什么不这样做？只是因为成本是已知的，而且很高。然后价值可能很低。一旦你能将成本降到零，你就会开始在所有这些你根本不会费心雇佣人类的领域雇佣AI，因为你无法培训人类，你无法找到人类，而且人类太昂贵了。
