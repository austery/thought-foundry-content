### 欢迎与背景介绍

**Nikolai:** 大家好，欢迎收听《**In Good Company**》（In Good Company: Norges Bank Investment Management制作的播客节目）。我是**Nikolai Tangen**（Nikolai Tangen: 挪威主权财富基金Norges Bank Investment Management的首席执行官），今天我们与壳牌（Shell）的首席执行官**Wael Sawan**（Wael Sawan: 壳牌现任首席执行官）进行对话。我们大多数人将壳牌与路边的加油站联系在一起，但壳牌是一家令人难以置信的公司，它从事勘探、生产、提炼、贸易和运输，涉及汽车、船舶、飞机等各种领域。事实上，我曾读到，壳牌一天提取的能源足以让一辆汽车往返月球超过18,000次。我们拥有该公司3%的股份，价值超过60亿美元。因此，Wael Sawan，欢迎您参加这次播客。

<p class="english-text">Hi everybody and welcome to In Good Company. I'm Nikolai Tangen, the CEO of the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund, and today we are talking to Wael Sawan, the CEO of Shell. Now, most of us associate Shell with a pit stop on the road, but Shell is an incredible company, exploring, producing, refining, trading, transporting things in cars, ships, planes, and so on. In fact, I've read that the amount of energy you extract in one day is enough to drive a car back and forth through the moon more than 18,000 times. We own 3% of the company, accounting for more than 6 billion US. So, Wael Sawan, welcome to this podcast.</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 非常感谢，Nikolai。

<p class="english-text">Thank you very much, Nikolai.</p>
</details>

### 多元文化背景与韧性

**Nikolai:** 您既是黎巴嫩人，也是加拿大公民。那么，您认为这两种背景是如何塑造您的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, you are both Lebanese and a Canadian citizen. So, tell me, how has this shaped you as a person, you think?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我认为思想和经验的多样性是我成长过程的核心。我实际上只在加拿大生活了五年，从未在黎巴嫩居住过，但当然，这两种文化都通过其文化对我有巨大的影响。它们让我能够接受人们在不同背景下拥有的不同观点，并从中学习。我认为最重要的是培养**韧性**（Resilience: 在压力、逆境或变化面前保持或恢复能力）。不幸的是，黎巴嫩人以韧性著称，因为这个国家经历了许多挑战。我认为，在当前我们所处的**地缘政治**（Geopolitics: 研究地理对国际政治和国际关系影响的学科）以及能源系统内外的变革时期，韧性是我们特别需要的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look, I think diversity of thought, diversity of experiences, is at the core, I suspect, of how I've grown up. I actually lived only five years in Canada, and I've never lived in Lebanon, yet, of course, both have had tremendous influence through culture. What they have done has made me accept the different perspectives that people have in different contexts and to learn from that. And I think most importantly, to build resilience. The Lebanese, unfortunately, are known for resilience, given the many challenges the country has had, and I think resilience is what we need in particular in times of change, as we currently have geopolitically, in the energy system and beyond.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 我们现在生活在一个许多情况下缺乏韧性的社会。您认为您的背景确实给了您更多的韧性吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, we live in a society now where there is in many cases very little resilience. Do you think that background really has given you more resilience?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我相信是这样。我认为不幸的是，人们只有在失去所拥有的东西时，才会真正懂得珍惜。我经常带我的孩子们回黎巴嫩看望我的父亲和妻子的父母。当他们在黎巴巴嫩时，他们才能体会到在欧洲、美国甚至中东其他地区生活时所享受的一些奢华。举个简单的例子，当他们乘坐电梯时，在黎巴嫩他们知道不要乘坐电梯，因为不幸的是，电梯通常会因为停电而停止运行。或者他们习惯了有时停电一两个小时，因为驱动大楼公用设施的发电机出了故障。他们已经习惯了更多这样的情况。我认为，这些对我们所拥有的一切，以及当今世界的能源系统能够提供我们所享受的舒适生活的小小感激，我们绝不应视为理所当然。这是我们所有人生活中，至少是我们大多数人生活中，我认为享受的核心部分。但仍有很多人无法获得能源。今天有7亿人没有电力供应，大约25亿人普遍无法获得可用的烹饪燃料等。所以，这些都是我认为我们不应忘记的一些因素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I believe so. I think unfortunately, one only gets to appreciate what one has when it's taken away from them. And often, I always take my kids back to Lebanon to see my father and my wife's parents. And it's when they are in Lebanon that they get to appreciate some of the luxuries that they enjoy, having lived in Europe, in the US, even in other parts of the Middle East. Simple thing, like when they take a lift, when it's in Lebanon, they know not to take the lifts because unfortunately, typically the lift gets stopped because of power cuts. Or they get used to, for example, sometimes the lights going out for an hour or two hours because the generator that has been driving the building's utilities goes down. But they've gotten used to a bit more of that. And I think those small elements of appreciation of what we have, what the energy system of today's world actually can do to be able to deliver the comforts that we all enjoy, we should never take for granted. It's such a core part of what we all, I think, enjoy in life, at least majority of us enjoy in life. But a lot of people still just do not have that access to energy. 700 million people today live without access to electricity, some 2 and a half billion in general do not have access to available cooking fuels and the like. So, those are some of the elements that I think we shouldn't forget.</p>

### 职业生涯与领导力转型

**Nikolai:** 您拥有化学工程背景，并且在壳牌工作了26年，然后突然成为了首席执行官。在接任之前，在一家公司工作这么长时间有什么优势？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, you have a background as a chemical engineer and you've been at Shell for 26 years, and bang, you are the CEO. What are the advantages of having spent so long time in a company before you take over?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我认为了解公司的背景、历史、现状以及未来的抱负非常重要。如果你没有真正从内部了解过公司，就很难做到这一点。正如您所说，我是一名化学工程师，这让我最大的收获也许是理解**系统思维**（Systems Thinking: 一种理解复杂系统的方法，强调各部分之间的相互关联和整体性）——端到端的系统，因为能源系统就是如此。你不能只看它的一端，无论是供应侧还是需求侧，而是要看从供应到中游基础设施，再到需求侧的整个集成价值链，以及它们如何协同运作。这涉及到技术、产品流，它贯穿整个领域。我认为化学工程是一个很好的领域，可以学习这些。我在壳牌工作了26、27年，曾在上游、天然气部门、下游零售部门以及可再生能源部门工作过，这让我能够开始看到各个部分如何组合成一个整体。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look, I think it's important to understand the context of the company, its history, its present, and the ambitions to go into the future. And it's tougher to do that if you haven't actually gotten to see the company from within. As you rightly say, I am a chemical engineer. That's allowed me, maybe the biggest learning I have from chemical engineering is to understand systems, end-to-end systems, because that's what the energy system is. You need to be able to look not just at one end of it, whether that's the supply side or the demand side, it's the whole integrated value chain from supply through the midstream infrastructure all the way to the demand side and how it all comes together. That plays in technology, that plays in product flows, it plays across the entire patch. And I think chemical engineering is a great field to be able to learn about that. And having been in Shell for some 26, 27 years now, and worked in the upstream, worked in the gas part of the company, worked in the downstream, in the retail part of the company, and worked in the renewables part of the company as well, it allows you to start to see how the pieces fit together into a whole.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 您担任首席执行官一年了，接管大权时最大的惊喜是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you've been CEO for one year. What was the big surprise taking over the reins?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我认为，随着你在公司中的成长，有些事情会发生根本性的变化。当然，你对时间投入和理解能力的需求会增加，但突然成为公司的内部和外部形象，我当然理解并理性认识到这一点，但当你真正身处那个位置时，感受是完全不同的。你会意识到每一个行动、每一句话是多么重要，因为人们都在关注着。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look, I think there is something fundamentally different as you grow through the company, where of course your overall requirement in terms of time spent and the need to be able to understand grow. But suddenly becoming the face of the company, both internally and externally, of course I'd appreciated it, I'd intellectualized, but it's very different when you actually get into that position and you recognize how important every action is, how important every word is, because people are looking at that.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 壳牌培养您担任这个职位多久了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How long did Shell groom you for the role?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我想，我是在2019年进入执行委员会，这当然改变了我在公司的形象。但我认为那是在此之前。我最决定性的时期可能是在2012年，当时我获得了领导我们在卡塔尔业务的机会。我当时在多哈，接手了一个职位，坦白说，Nikolai，我当时心想，他们是不是找错人了，这份工作太大了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I suspect, I mean, the day that I got onto the executive committee in 2019, of course, created a step change in the profile in the company. But I suspect it was before that. I mean, I had maybe my most defining period was in 2012, when I was given the opportunity to lead our Qatar business. I was in Doha at the time, and I stepped into a role which, if I'm honest with you, Nikolai, I thought to myself, I think they've gotten the wrong guy for this job. This is just too big.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 那么它真的太大了吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And was it too big?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 呃，前六个月，我瘦了大约四五公斤，因为我从早上五点到半夜都在不停地工作，努力去了解我们现场的1600名员工。在我接手那份工作之前，我管理着一个大约20人的商业和新业务团队，所以我还有很长的路要走。这不仅仅是通过演讲来了解他们，而是通过去了解他们的业务、他们的挑战、他们的困境，然后建立信任。我认为那段领导力旅程让壳牌有机会说，让我们看看这个人是否能成为众多优秀候选人之一，有一天可以领导壳牌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, the first six months, I lost around four, five kilograms because I was just from 5:00 in the morning to midnight, just working and working and working more to be able to get to know the people. We had 1,600 people on site. And before I took over that job, I was running the commercial and new business team of around 20 people. So, I had a long way to go. And not just getting to know them by giving speeches, getting to know them by going to understand their business, to understand their challenges, their dilemmas, and then building trust. And I think that leadership journey gave Shell the opportunity to be able to say, let's see whether this person can be one of the many terrific candidates that one day could lead Shell.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 最终他们为什么选择您？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And why did they pick you at the end?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我认为我在当时为壳牌带来了清晰的战略感，以及我过往的执行记录，这是董事会一直在寻找的重要部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think what I brought at this point in time in Shell is we felt our strategy was clear, and my track record of execution was an important part of, I think, what the board was looking for.</p>
</details>

### 领导力建议与壳牌的效率冲刺

**Nikolai:** 那么，当您被任命为首席执行官时，您会给那些处于类似情况的人什么建议？您最初做了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So then, you're appointed CEO. What advice would you give to people who get into those type of situations? What did you do in the beginning?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我很早就得到了一条非常重要的建议，尤其是我来自公司内部，并且已经在公司工作了26年。这条建议是：像一个外部聘请的首席执行官那样对待这份工作。不要对你成长过程中所习惯的范式和那些你在这26、27年里所接受的“神圣不可侵犯”的观念感到过于安逸。像一个外部首席执行官那样去处理它，这实际上是一个很棒的建议。回到基本面，真正审视比较对象，然后说我们究竟在哪里做得好，哪里做得不好。这也让我能够摆脱“这就是我们今天的组织结构，让我们继续下去”的思维，转变为“不，让我们挑战这种组织结构，让我们挑战我们正在走向的目标，并确保我们继续坚定不移地致力于这个目标。让我们挑战我们的执行方式，挑战我们公司如何执行。”所有这些都是我上任时的一个重要部分，我会向任何人推荐它。因为太容易陷入“一直以来都是这样，所以未来也必须这样”的安逸状态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A very important piece of advice I got early on was, in particular, coming from the company and having spent 26 years in the company, the advice was: approach it as if you were an external hire. Don't get too comfortable with what you've grown up in, the paradigms, the sacred cows that you have adopted in your 26, 27 years in the company. Approach it like an external CEO will. And that was great advice, actually. Just go back and look at the fundamentals, really look at the comparators and say, where are we actually winning and where are we not? And that allowed me as well to sort of lift myself from, "This is the organizational structure we have today, let's continue with it," to, "No, let's challenge that organizational structure. Let's challenge the destination that we're going and make sure that we continue to be absolutely committed to that destination. Let's challenge the way we execute. Let's challenge how we execute as a company as well." All of that was an important piece of coming in, and I would recommend it to anyone. It's just too easy to fall into the lull of, "This is how it's always been, this is therefore how it always needs to be."</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 您启动了一项效率计划，并开始削减成本。请您谈谈这个计划。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you launched an efficiency program and also started to cut some costs. Tell me about the program.</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我们称之为“冲刺”（Sprint），一个十个季度的冲刺。我们选择十个季度是因为在我们的行业中，考虑到许多项目的孕育周期，你很容易承诺五到十年后的事情。我们认为作为一个新的管理团队，我们不能简单地要求人们信任我们，我们需要向他们展示他们可以信任我们。因此，十个季度是可衡量的、清晰的，同时仍给我们足够的时间进行必要的改变。我们试图简化组织内外关注的焦点，强调我们正在努力做两件事：创造更多价值和减少排放。所以，每一个决定都需要反映我们如何能增强价值或减少排放，这应该相对直接。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We called it a Sprint, a 10-quarter Sprint. And the reason we chose 10 quarters is, in our industry, you could easily sort of promise things at five, 10 years, just given the gestation of many of our projects. We didn't feel that we, as a new management team, could simply ask people to trust us. We needed to be able to show them they can trust us. And therefore, 10 quarters was measurable, was clear, while still giving us enough time to be able to make the changes that we needed to make. And we tried to simplify the focus for the organization and for everyone outside to say there's a couple things we're trying to do: more value and less emissions. So, every decision needs to reflect on the impact we can have on either enhancing value or reducing emissions, which should be relatively straightforward.</p>
</details>

作为冲刺的一部分，我们简化了高层结构：我们将执行委员会成员从九人减少到七人。我们有多个目标，超过75个运营、财务和碳排放目标，我们将其减少到八个：四个财务目标和四个碳排放目标，这让组织非常清楚我们想要什么。我们提高了绩效节奏和速度，现在高层每两周和每月进行绩效评估，深入组织内部则更加频繁。这让我们能更清楚地了解：你是否有需要的数据来判断我们是否正在取得进展？这些数据是否显示我们正在取得进展？哪些地方需要干预？所以，这是一项全面而彻底的公司转型，一家拥有优秀文化的公司，但需要通过绩效纪律和简化这三个关键要素来补充。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, what we've done as part of that Sprint is we've simplified the top of the house. We had nine executive committee members, we've leveled that down to seven. We had multiple targets, we had over 75 operational, financial, and carbon targets. We've reduced that to eight: four financial and four carbon, making it very clear to the organization what it is that we want. We upped the performance cadence speed. We have gone now into bi-weekly and monthly performance cadences at the top of the house, and that is even more frequent as you go deeper into the organization, allowing us to become much clearer on, "Do you have the data that you need to be able to understand whether we're making progress? Is that data showing that we are making progress? Where are interventions required?" So, this is a belts and braces transformation of the company, a company that has a great culture, but one that needs to be supplemented with these three key elements of performance, discipline, and simplification.</p>
</details>

### 壳牌的优势与劣势：能源转型中的战略定位

**Nikolai:** 壳牌做了很多不同的事情，您在哪些方面是行业第一？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You do a lot of different things at Shell. Where are you the number one?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我认为我们在几个领域展现了领导力。首先是深水领域，我们对自己的地位感到非常满意，更重要的是，我们继续执行新项目的方式，例如在墨西哥湾，我们最近投产了Vito项目，我们正在推进Whale项目和Sparta项目。所以，这确实是我们的核心领域，巴西在深水领域也是如此。**LNG**（Liquefied Natural Gas: 液化天然气）是另一个我认为我们表现出色的领域。我们是继卡塔尔能源公司之后最大的LNG参与者，就国际石油和天然气公司而言，我们是最大的单一参与者。所以，这是一个我们拥有真正实力的领域，也是我们看到世界确实需要大量天然气，特别是LNG的领域，如果我们希望按照我们期望的方向脱碳的话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's a few areas that I think we have been able to demonstrate leadership. One is in deep water. We're very pleased with our position, and more importantly, in the way we continue to execute new projects, such as in the Gulf of Mexico. We've recently commissioned our Vito project, we're in the process of working up our Whale project, our Sparta project. So, that's a real heartland for us, as is Brazil in the context of deepwater. LNG would be another area that I think we have excelled at. We are, after QatarEnergy, the largest player in LNG, the single largest in terms of the international oil and gas companies. So, that's an area where we do have real strength and an area where we see the world really needing a huge amount of gas and LNG in particular, if we are to decarbonize in the direction we would hope we go.</p>
</details>

另一个我认为我们特别强大的领域是贸易。我们拥有能源行业中全球最大的贸易和优化公司之一。也许我最后要提到的是我们的营销组织。您一开始提到了品牌和加油站。我们在全球有46,000个加油站。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Another area I think we are particularly strong at is trading. We have one of the largest trading and optimization houses in the energy sector anywhere in the world. And maybe the last one I'd mention is our marketing organization. You started off by referencing the brand and the pit stop as you go around. We have 46,000 stations around the world.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 我不得不说，我在其中许多地方吃过热狗，它们味道不错，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I have to say, I've eaten hot dogs in many of them, and well, they're good, right?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 不错，这是一个重要的反馈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good. That's an important feedback.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 那么，您在哪里比较弱？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, where are you weak?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我们在哪里比较弱？我认为在某些领域，我们曾尝试涉足，但结果表明我们可能不是最好的参与者。例如，一个领域是纯粹的可再生能源发电领域。我们曾尝试过，但未能证明我们仅在可再生能源发电部分具有竞争力。为什么？因为我认为这不需要同样复杂的系统，它具有不同的风险特征，而且不一定能发挥我们的优势。我们通常带来的优势是大型项目管理能力以及价值链不同部分的整合。如果你考虑太阳能电池板安装，它是一个相对基本的环节。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Where are we weak? I think in certain areas we have tried to play, and we have shown ourselves that maybe we're not the best players. One area, for example, is trying to play purely the renewable generation space. We've tried there, we haven't been able to see that we can be competitive in just the renewable generation part. Why? Because I think this doesn't require the same complex systems, it's different risk profile, and it doesn't necessarily play to what we bring. And what we typically bring is big project management capability, integration of different parts of a value chain. If you take solar panel installation, it's a relatively basic element.</p>
</details>

但我可以给您一个更具体的例子。我们曾考虑在非洲提供能源，例如尝试在那里安装太阳能电池板，为那些无法获得电力的人提供服务。结果是，我们需要一辆运输太阳能电池板的车辆，周围还需要两辆安全车来遵循我们的安全协议。当安装人员爬到屋顶安装电池板时，我们还需要安全带。这与其他人会做的事情非常不同。所以，我们实际上在成本结构上产生了负协同效应。因此，我们说，我们不涉足那个领域，而是在整合价值链中发挥作用，并与其他人合作进行可再生能源发电。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I'll give you a more specific example in that context. We were looking at energy access in Africa, for example, trying to install solar panels there for folks who don't have access to it. What ended up happening is we would need, in essence, the vehicle that's transporting the solar panel to be surrounded by two safety vehicles to be able to follow our safety protocols. We needed harnesses by the time the person got to the roof of the house in which he was installing that panel. That's very different than what others would do. And so, we were actually dissynergizing on the cost structure. And so, we've said, look, let's not play in that space, let's play across the integrated value chain and partner in that part of the value chain, the renewable generation, with others.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 那么，这是否意味着您认为综合能源公司不应该做太阳能？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, does it mean that you think that the integrated energy companies should not be doing solar?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 不，我认为如果他们要做太阳能，就应该引入擅长太阳能的合作伙伴，并明确自己为何要涉足太阳能领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, I think if they're going to do solar, bring in the partners who are excellent at doing solar and decide why you want to play in the solar space.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 太阳能与其他类型的能源之间真的有协同效应吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is there really any synergies between solar and other types of energy?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我认为最大的协同效应在于更全面地看待能源系统。我们目前看到的情况是，以美国为例，我们是天然气和电力领域最大的参与者之一。我们希望能够实现该市场电力销售的脱碳，并同时实现天然气和电力的脱碳。您现在会发现，您无法获得绿色电力，因为绿色电力不足。因此，我们需要在绿色能源领域，在绿色电力领域充分发挥作用，进行开发。在某个时候，我们可以将其稀释，保持20%的股权，但随后获得不成比例的更大份额的绿色电力，我们可以将其纳入我们的系统。我们服务的许多B2B客户，我们为他们提供润滑油、天然气和各种能源产品，他们都要求获得绿色电力。作为最大的能源贸易商，如果说我们没有绿色电力，那将不是正确的方法。因此，我们正在努力利用我们的优势，将绿色电力引入系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the biggest synergy is when you look at the energy system more holistically. What we see at the moment is, take the US, where we are one of the largest players in gas and power. We want to be able to decarbonize our sales of electricity in that market, as well as decarbonize both the gas and the power. What you find right now is you cannot get access to green electrons because there aren't enough of them. So, we need to be able to play sufficiently in the green energy space, in the green electron space, develop it. At some point, we can dilute it down to keep a 20% equity interest, but then take a disproportionately larger amount of the green electrons, which we can put into our system. Many of our B2B customers, whom we serve with lubricants, we serve with gas, we serve with all sorts of energy products, are demanding green electricity to come to them. As the largest energy trader, to say, "Well, we don't have that," wouldn't be the right approach. And therefore, we're trying to leverage our strength to be able to bring green electrons to the system.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 风能是否应该由综合能源公司来完成？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Should wind be done by the integrated energy companies?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 再次强调，我认为在陆上风电方面，很难看出我们能带来什么特别的优势。但在海上风电方面，对于大型参与者来说，逻辑性更强，特别是考虑到我们的深水经验和海上风电更复杂的特点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, I think playing to one's strength on onshore wind, it's tougher to see what particular we would bring. On the offshore side, there's more logic to be had for the big players, in particular, given our deepwater experience and the more complex element of offshore wind.</p>

**Wael Sawan:** 我认为我们目前扮演的角色是成为一个多元能源参与者。因此，我们认为我们将继续生产碳排放越来越低的石油，我们认为我们将在主要公司中成为最大的**LNG**（Liquefied Natural Gas: 液化天然气）运输商。但随后，我们认为我们将在低碳解决方案领域发挥作用，包括低碳分子解决方案以及适当的低碳绿色电力解决方案。我指的是什么？我们认为我们将在未来涉足绿色氢能等领域。我们目前正在鹿特丹开发欧洲最大的绿色氢能设施。我们认为我们将在生物燃料领域发挥作用，生产低碳燃料。我们是当今世界上最大的**生物燃料**（Biofuels: 由生物质而非化石燃料制成的燃料）混合商。我们认为我们还将在其他领域发挥作用，例如**碳捕获与封存**（Carbon Capture and Sequestration, CCS: 捕获工业和能源生产中产生的二氧化碳并将其长期储存的技术），这是一个我们一直在努力的领域，包括在挪威的“北方之光”项目。我们认为我们能够为客户提供基于自然的解决方案，例如碳信用额等。因此，我们真正着眼于整体系统，但专注于我们拥有差异化能力和竞争优势的领域。

<p class="english-text">I think the role we play right now is to be a multi-energy player. So, we see ourselves continuing to produce lower and lower carbon oil. We see ourselves being the movers of the largest amount of LNG amongst the majors. But then we see ourselves playing across lower carbon solutions, both in terms of lower carbon molecular solutions and where appropriate, lower carbon green electron solutions. And what do I mean by that? We see ourselves playing in areas such as one day green hydrogen. We are developing the largest green hydrogen facility in Europe at the moment in Rotterdam. We see ourselves playing in the bio space, in low carbon fuels. We are the single largest blender of biofuels in the world today. We see ourselves playing in other areas as well, such as, for example, carbon capture and sequestration, which is an area we've been working, including, for example, in Norway, in the Northern Lights project. And we see ourselves as being able to offer our customers nature-based solutions, for example, carbon credits and the like. So, really looking at the holistic system, but focusing on the areas where we have differentiated capabilities and competitive strengths.</p>

**Nikolai:** 您尝试同时开发电动汽车充电和生物燃料，同时驾驭这两匹马有意义吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, you tried to develop both electrical vehicle charging and biofuel. Does it make sense to kind of ride both those horses?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我认为有意义。我认为归根结底，我们今天服务着两个主要行业：交通运输业（无论是乘用车、商用道路运输、航空还是航运）以及工业部门。这两个部门都需要不同的东西。例如，乘用车需要**EV 充电**（EV Charging: 电动汽车充电）。因此，虽然我们传统上销售汽油和柴油，但我们看到对电动汽车充电的需求不断增长，因此我们可以与我们现有的零售站点协同，并增加电动汽车充电的选择。而生物燃料则略有不同。我们认为生物燃料更适合服务于航运领域的客户、航空领域的客户（使用可持续航空燃料）以及商用道路运输领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it does. I mean, I think at the end of the day, there are two major sectors that we serve today: the transport sector, whether that's passenger vehicles, commercial road transport, aviation or shipping, as well as the industrial sectors. They both need different things. So, for example, passenger vehicles needs EV charging. So, while we have been selling traditionally gasoline and diesel, we see a growing pool of demand for EV charging, and so we can actually synergize with our existing retail sites and add the option of EV charging. Whereas biofuels are slightly different. Biofuels we see much more akin to playing to our customers in the shipping space, in the aviation space with sustainable aviation fuels, and in the commercial road transport space.</p>

### 市场反馈与股东沟通：平衡短期与长期战略

**Nikolai:** 许多公司正试图将自己重新定位为综合性可再生能源公司等等。我认为有趣的是，股市根据他们发布各种公告的时间，以不同的方式奖励他们。所以在某个阶段，花更多时间在可再生能源上非常好，然后公司改变策略，说他们会减少这方面的投入，然后股价就会上涨。您认为股市如何影响您的想法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, a lot of companies are trying to reposition themselves as integrated renewable companies and so on. And I think what's interesting is that the stock market is rewarding them in different ways depending on when they come with various types of announcements. So, at some stage it's very good to spend more time on renewables, and then companies change tack and say they're going to do less of it, and then the share prices go up on it. I mean, how do stock markets shape what you think?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我认为倾听股东的意见很重要，但最终我们也在推动一项长期战略，而且我认为两者并不冲突。股东们想说的是：“向我展示你们拥有可投资的商业模式，这些模式能让公司持续实现现金流增长，并带来适当的股东回报。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's important to listen to shareholders, but ultimately we are also driving a long-term strategy, and I don't think the two are in conflict. What shareholders are saying is, "Show me that you have investable business models that allow me to continue to see cash flow growth in this company, that allow me to have the appropriate shareholder returns."</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 是的，但那是他们现在说的，三四年前他们可不是这么说的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, but that's what they're saying now, but they didn't say that three, four years ago.</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我认为当时有一个更广泛的背景。您说得完全正确，三四年前，不仅是股东，实际上是社会上很大一部分人，尤其是在西北欧，我们听到了对任何石油和天然气生产的非常强烈的担忧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think there was a much broader context. You're absolutely right. Three, four years ago, the narrative, and not just by shareholders, by actually a significant portion of society, more acutely here in Northwest Europe, we heard very, very loud concerns around any oil and gas production.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 那么，如果我们现在回到那个时期，再次面临那种政治压力，您会改变您的目标和您所追求的吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, if we now go back to such a period and you get that same kind of political pressure back, will you change your targets and what you aim for?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我认为你不能成为一家本质上是全世界所有人所有要求的“蒸馏物”的公司，因为在今天这个地缘政治、经济和社会都高度两极分化的世界里，我们需要非常清楚我们作为一家公司想成为什么。但这并不意味着你不能根据你所看到的价值池和优势来发展你的战略。我们曾认为我们可以在家庭能源和向家庭售电方面发挥作用，但这并没有成功，所以我们不得不改变。我们不能简单地继续做那些对我们不起作用的事情，但我们需要对此保持透明。所以对我来说，最重要的事情是与我们的股东非常清楚地沟通我们的意图，尽可能多地给他们衡量我们进展的机会，然后让他们做出选择。我无法影响那些只想押注石油的人的决定，那不是壳牌这样的公司。我们也不是一家只会成为海上风电公司或太阳能公司的公司。我们希望成为能源转型中的投资案例，提供多种能源载体，这就是我们认为我们所代表的投资案例，也是我们希望能够吸引股东的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think you can be a company that's in essence the distillation of all the asks of everyone around the world, because in a world that is particularly polarized today, geopolitically, economically, socially, what we need to do is to be very clear on who we want to be as a company. But that doesn't mean that you do not evolve your strategy depending on where you see value pools and where you see strengths. We thought we could potentially play in home energy and selling power to homes. That didn't work out for us, so we had to change. We can't simply keep doing the things that are not working for us, but we need to be transparent around that. So, the number one thing for me is be very clear with our shareholders what our intent is, give them as much opportunity to be able to measure our progress as we can, and then let them make the choices. I cannot influence the decision of somebody who is simply wanting to bet on oil. That's not the company that Shell is, nor are we a company that's simply going to be an offshore wind company or a solar company. We want to be the investment case through the energy transition, offering multiple energy vectors, and that's what we think we are the investment case for, and that's what we hope to be able to appeal to our shareholders with.</p>

### 《通胀削减法案》与能源转型的现实挑战

**Nikolai:** 《**通胀削减法案**》（Inflation Reduction Act, IRA: 美国旨在通过投资清洁能源、降低医疗成本和增加税收来应对通胀的法案）的持续性有多重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How important is a continuation of the Inflation Reduction Act?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我认为这是一个关键因素，我之所以这么说，原因有二。首先，它在全球范围内制造了一种“**Fomo**”（Fear of Missing Out: 错失恐惧症），你知道，让许多其他国家感到错失良机。你看到《通胀削减法案》实际上启发了全球其他一些法案，例如欧盟的“Fit for 55”计划，它在《通胀削减法案》的推动下变得更强更好。但它也将是确保《通胀削减法案》的实施按计划进行的关键。风险在于，在漫长的投资周期中，财政和监管框架的重大变化可能会损害这些投资的信心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's a critical element. And the reason I say that is, one, it creates, allow me to say, FOMO, fear of missing out by many others around the world. And you see actually the Inflation Reduction Act has inspired a few other acts around the world. For example, the EU Fit for 55 that became stronger and better on the back of the Inflation Reduction Act. But it also is going to be critical to make sure that the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act continues as planned. The risk is, in what are long investment horizons, that significant change in the fiscal and the regulatory framework could undermine confidence in these investments.</p>

**Nikolai:** 沙特阿拉伯石油公司的首席执行官最近表示，是时候放弃逐步淘汰石油和天然气的幻想了。那么，认为我们会逐步淘汰石油和天然气是一种幻想吗？

<p class="english-text">Now, the CEO of Saudi Arabian oil company said recently that it's time to abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas. Is it a fantasy to think we'll phase it out?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我认为在未来几年，我们必须务实地看待现实。我们看到石油和天然气是能源系统的重要组成部分。事实上，今天化石燃料占能源系统的80%以上。所以，我们需要做的是继续寻找减少对化石燃料依赖的途径，但这必须是一个明智的能源转型，不能剥夺需要能源的人们的资源。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think in the coming years, one has to be pragmatic and look at the realities. We see oil and gas is a critical part of the energy system. In fact, fossil fuels today are over 80% of the energy system. So, what we need to do is to be able to continue to find pathways to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels, but it's going to have to be an informed energy transition that does not take away resources from people that need it.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 但这真的是一个转型吗？我们不是仅仅在现有能源基础上增加另一种能源吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But is it, but is it actually a transition? Aren't we just adding one energy source onto the other energy source we are today?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 是的，您说得对，我们今天就是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You're right, we are today.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 那么，您认为石油和天然气何时会开始下降？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when do you think oil and gas will start to decline?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我认为天然气还有很长的路要走。我认为在接下来的，至少到2040年代，我们看到天然气的作用会越来越大，无论是作为煤炭的替代品，还是作为可再生能源的补充，因为可再生能源具有间歇性。石油产品我认为在本十年内将继续增长，最早可能在下一个十年我们就能看到所有产品需求的峰值。但谁知道呢，这取决于需求水平。我们现在看到的是，出现了一些我们几年前没有预料到的新能源需求来源，比如生成式人工智能、加密货币挖矿，所有这些实际上都在增加能源需求，而不是减少它，这是一个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think gas has a long way to go. I think for the next, at least through the 2040s, we see a growing role for gas, as either a replacement for coal or critically as well as a support, as a supplement to renewables because of the intermittency of renewables. Oil products, I think, will continue to grow through this decade, and possibly by as early as the next decade, we could start to see a peaking of oil products demand. But who knows, that's going to depend on demand levels. What we see right now is there are new sources of energy demand that we hadn't anticipated just a few years ago, like generative AI, like crypto mining. All of that is actually enhancing the demand for energy rather than reducing it, and that's an issue.</p>

### 气候行动、法律诉讼与利益相关者沟通

**Nikolai:** 股东对话。我们与你们进行了很好的对话，我们很感谢你们真正与我们接触。那么，当涉及到你们最新的气候方案时，你们如何看待利益相关者的参与？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ownership dialogue. So, we have great dialogue with you guys, and we appreciate that you really engage with us. Now, how do you think about stakeholder engagement when it comes to things like your latest climate package?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我认为最重要的是在所做的一切事情上保持透明。我认为我们需要明确我们作为一家公司所代表的立场，然后与我们的股东分享。我认为与那些同意我们观点的人（其中有很多人）以及那些不同意我们观点的人（同样有很多人）进行对话至关重要。因此，在我们宣布能源转型战略报告的那天，也就是三周前，我专门安排了时间与公司各部门的员工进行交流，与股东进行交流，以及与我们称之为全球气候影响者、非政府组织进行交流，他们对能源转型有着非常非常强烈的看法，不一定总是与我们一致，但都是重要且不同的观点，我认为作为一家公司，倾听并从中学习至关重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's absolutely critical to be first and foremost transparent in everything one does. I think we need to be clear what we stand for as a company, and then to share it with our shareholders. I think then dialogue is critical with those who agree with you, of which there are many, and with those who disagree with us, again, of which there are many. So, on the day that we announced our energy transition strategy report, which was just three weeks ago, I had time dedicated to engagement with staff across the company, time dedicated to engagement with shareholders, time dedicated to engagements with what we would call climate influencers from around the world, non-governmental organizations who have a very, very strong view on the energy transition, not necessarily always an aligned view, but good, important, different views, which I think it's critical for us as a company to be listening to, to be learning from.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 在这个领域，法律活动越来越多，其中一个大问题是，个别公司是否需要承担国家在减排方面的法律义务。您正卷入一场大型诉讼，您认为这将如何发展？因为这对您的未来至关重要，对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's a lot of increasingly there's a lot of legal activity in this field, and of course the big one being whether individual companies need to share the legal obligations of states in terms of cutting emissions. And you're in the middle of a big lawsuit here. How do you think this will pan out? Because it's quite, it's quite key to your future, right?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 是的，我认为您提到了几个问题。我认为其中一个要素是，作为一家公司，您拥有什么？我们坚信我们对自己的排放负有责任，我们通常称之为**范围一**（Scope 1: 企业直接控制或拥有的排放源产生的温室气体排放）并将其扩展到**范围二**（Scope 2: 企业购买的电力、热力或蒸汽产生的间接温室气体排放）。这些是我们自身活动产生的排放，或者直接进入我们生产地的排放。我们还认为，像我们这样的公司对**范围三**（Scope 3: 企业价值链中所有其他间接排放）负有责任，这就是为什么我们采纳了范围三目标和抱负，认识到我们并非拥有所有杠杆来影响范围三的数字，但我们认为，如果我们能够投入其中并设定一些目标，这将使我们能够与客户合作，塑造我们销售的产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, so I think that you touch on a couple questions there. I think one element of this is, what is it that you own as a company? We are firmly of a belief that we have accountability for our own emissions, what we would typically call Scope 1 and extend it into Scope 2. Those are the emissions that we produce from our own activities or which come directly into the site where we produce. We also think there's a responsibility that companies like ours have towards Scope 3, which is why we adopted Scope 3 targets and ambitions, recognizing we don't have all the levers to be able to influence the Scope 3 numbers, but feeling that if we can lean into that and set some goals there, it'll allow us to work with our customers to shape those products that we are selling. So, that's an important element.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 那么，请您解释一下，范围三基本上是由您销售的石油造成的污染？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, just to explain here, Scope 3 is basically the pollution caused by the oil you sell?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 是的，它是我们销售给客户的任何产品的排放，但排放是在客户使用产品时实现的。所以不是你，而是客户？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's the emissions of any product we sell to our customer, but the emission is realized when the customer uses the product. So, it's not you, but the customers?</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Correct.</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 所以今天，如果我们向您出售汽油来为您的汽车加油，当您驾驶那辆车时，大约90%的排放实际上是产生的，而从生产石油到交付到您的汽车的整个价值链中产生的排放不到10%。所以问题是，我们如何与客户合作，支持他们的脱碳之旅？我刚才举的例子可能是，我们为客户设立一个电动汽车充电点，在他们想要投资电动汽车的时候。另一点可能是，我们为他们提供生物混合燃料，从而减少他们车辆的排放。我们可以向他们销售润滑油，这也能够减少车辆使用过程中的排放。因此，我们可能有多种杠杆可以应用，但我们并非拥有所有控制杠杆。只有Nikolai才能选择是否购买电动汽车，这些是客户必须做出的选择。这就是我们对此的看法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, today, if we sell you gasoline, for example, to fuel your car, when you drive that car, roughly 90% of the emissions are actually generated versus the less than 10% emissions generated in the entire value chain all the way from producing the oil to delivering it to your car. And so, the question is, how do we work with our customers to support them on their decarbonization journey? The example I just gave could be that we set up an EV charging point for our customers at the point that they want to invest in an EV. Another point could be we offer them a bio blend so that we reduce the emission of their vehicle. We can sell them lubricants that allow us to also reduce the emissions from the use of the vehicle. So, there are multiple levers we could potentially apply, but we don't have all the levers of control. Only Nikolai can choose if you want to buy an EV or not. Those are choices that the customers have to make. And so, that's how we think about that.</p>
</details>

现在，当谈到诉讼时，我认为最终我们都在努力实现的目标是脱碳，并确保我们紧急采取行动，应对气候变化最严重的影响，这些影响正在我们身边日复一日地发生。现在的问题是，最好的方法是什么？是把义务强加给欧洲的一家公司，还是由民选政府来决定如何为行业制定这些政策，然后行业再做出回应？这是我们诉讼中的一个核心争议点。仅仅让壳牌承担义务，而我们的客户没有同样的义务，这是不正确的。第二个关键要素是，法院来决定公司的战略是不正确的，这个问题必须留给董事会。所以，这些是我们正在讨论或支持的诉讼中的一些要素，我们希望在今年年底前能有更多了解。无论如何，我们都将继续专注于我们能控制的事情，即我们运营公司的方式，以及我们如何遵守我们承诺要做的一些关键要素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, when it comes to the lawsuit, I think at the end of the day, the end point we're trying to all drive towards is decarbonization and making sure that we urgently act on the worst impacts of climate change, which is happening around us. We experience it today, day in, day out. Now, the question is, what is the best approach? Is it right to put the obligation on a single company in Europe, or is it right to do it much more as elected governments choosing how they want to be able to set those policies for industries to then respond? That's a core point of contention that we have in our lawsuit. It's not right just for a Shell to have the obligation without our customers having that same obligation. The second key element is, it's not right for a court to actually determine the strategy of the company. That's a question that has to be left to the board. So, those are some of the elements that we are discussing in this, or that we are supporting in the lawsuit, and we hope to have a bit more insights. We're actually through the appeal process over the last week, and we expect to hear back towards the end of the year. Irrespective of that, we continue to focus on what we can control, which is the way we run the company and how we actually adhere to some of the key elements that we have committed to doing.</p>

**Nikolai:** 但我们在这个领域也有其他活动。埃克森美孚正在起诉激进股东，您正在起诉绿色和平组织。这是怎么回事？

<p class="english-text">But we also have some other activity in this space. Exxon is suing activist shareholders, you are suing Greenpeace. What is this about?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我可以谈谈我们正在做的事情。我们坚信每个人都有权抗议，只要它是合法的和安全的。具体到绿色和平组织，这不是一个新的诉讼，而是发生在2023年2月的事情。当时，一些抗议者非法登上一艘正在移动的船只，一艘72,000公吨的移动船只。法官表示，他们正在将自己的生命置于危险之中，也危及我们船员的生命。我完全不反对任何人抗议北海是否应该进行石油和天然气开采，但以那种方式进行抗议可能会严重伤害我们的人员。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look, I can talk about what we are doing. We fundamentally believe in everyone's right to protest, as long as it is lawful and as long as it's safe. What happened specifically with Greenpeace, this is not a new lawsuit, this is something that happened in February of 2023. What happened there was a number of protesters illegally mounted a moving vessel, a 72,000 metric ton moving vessel. The judge said that they were putting their own lives at risk and they were putting our crew's life at risk. I have no problem with anyone wanting to protest whether oil and gas should be taking place in the North Sea, but to do it in the way that it was done could potentially have significantly hurt our people.</p>

### 地缘政治与能源转型：全球化与碎片化的挑战

**Nikolai:** 谈到地缘政治，我们之前也提到了。您认为能源转型对地缘政治有什么影响？两者之间是如何相互作用的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moving on to geopolitics, we touched upon that earlier on. Now, what impact do you see the energy transition having on geopolitics? What is the interplay between the two?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 它们之间有着深刻的相互作用。我认为能源转型的核心在于，我们是要走向一个更加全球化的世界，还是会变得更加本土化、保护主义的世界？这些因素将发挥作用。能源流动的能源走廊和贸易走廊是否会开始转向盟友方，而不是自由流动的能源？当然，我们今天在红海及其他地区看到的干扰正在对能源流动产生影响。所以，我认为两者之间有着显著的相互关联。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's a heavy interplay. I think at the heart of the energy transition will be the difference between, are we going to be a much more globalized world, or are we going to become a much more localized, protective, protectionist world? Those will play up. Whether the energy corridors, the trade corridors of energy flows start to move towards allied parties, away from what is a free flow of energy. Of course, disruptions that we see today, for example, in the Red Sea and beyond, are having their own impact on energy flows. So, I think the two are significantly interlined.</p>

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what are the consequences of that? What will it lead to?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我认为最终它将导致比预期更慢的能源转型。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think at the end of the day, it's going to lead to a slower energy transition than would have been desired.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 抱歉，为什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm sorry, why?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 嗯，当今能源转型最大的推动力是进入市场的成本极低的中国产品。看看能源转型主要发生在哪里，去年超过50%的电动汽车在中国销售，超过50%的可再生能源发电在中国部署。这是因为你拥有低于1万美元的电动汽车，并且能够在中国采购廉价的太阳能电池板。当你转向世界其他地区时，负担能力限制开始显现。因此，随着我们看到越来越多的保护主义措施，这将产生影响。这当然意味着更多的本地生产，但这将是成本更高的本地生产，更难以与石油和天然气等低成本能源竞争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, the biggest enabler of the energy transition today has been the very low-cost Chinese products that are coming into the market. You look at the majority of where the energy transition is happening. Over 50% of EVs were sold in China last year. Over 50% of renewable generation was deployed in China. And that's because you have less than $10,000 EVs, and your ability to be able to source cheap solar panels is in China. As you move towards the rest of the world, affordability constraints start to kick in. And therefore, as we see more and more protectionist measures, that's going to have an impact. It will mean, of course, more local production, but it's going to be local production at higher cost that will be more difficult to compete against lower cost energy sources like oil and gas.</p>
</details>

这就是为什么我认为地缘政治两极分化存在减缓能源转型的风险。它还将意味着能源流动方式中越来越多的中断。至关重要的是，当我们看到可再生能源在能源领域扮演更大角色时，间歇性是不可避免的，因此能源领域的波动性只会增加。我们刚刚在过去几年中，在俄罗斯入侵乌克兰之后，看到了这种波动性如何影响从生活成本到投票模式等方方面面。当我们展望未来时，这是一个令人担忧的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's why I think there's a risk of the geopolitical polarization slowing down the energy transition. It will also mean more and more disruption in the way energy flows. And critically, as we look at a larger role for renewables in the energy sector, intermittency is inevitable, and therefore the volatility in the energy sector will only increase. And volatility we have seen just in the last few years after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, how that volatility plays and impacts everything from cost of living through to voting patterns and beyond. And that is a concern as we look into the future.</p>
</details>

### 壳牌的企业文化演变与未来愿景

**Nikolai:** 谈到企业文化，壳牌基本上是两家公司的合并：一家是英国公司壳牌，另一家是荷兰皇家石油公司。这可以追溯到1907年，已经有一段时间了。然后您将总部迁到了伦敦，您现在就住在那里。但当时也有关于您可能将其迁至美国的讨论。当您搬迁时，壳牌现在拥有什么样的企业文化？您会如何定义它？

But there were also talks about you potentially moving it to America, I guess, at the time. When you moved, just what kind of corporate culture do you have now at Shell? How would you define it?</p>

**Wael Sawan:** 我认为定义一种文化真的很难，除了将其追溯到文化所倡导的核心价值观。我们的价值观长期以来一直很明确，那就是诚实、正直和尊重他人。但您的问题当然确实反映了我们当初将壳牌的两部分合并时的情景，当然，这种文化也一直在演变。但我们仍然拥有我们一直以来作为一家公司所拥有的并享受的英荷核心。我们的英国和荷兰存在当然塑造了我们的历史。例如，2004年我们遇到了真正的挑战，我们的储量危机，以及此后在**Jeroen van der Veer**（Jeroen van der Veer: 壳牌前首席执行官）的领导下，这如何塑造了公司。所有这些实际上都创造了今天的壳牌文化。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I think it's really difficult to define a culture, other than to take it back to the core values that the culture espouses. And our values have been clear for a long, long time now. It's all about honesty, integrity, and respect for people. But your question, of course, indeed reflects all the way back to when we brought the two parts of Shell together. And of course, there's been an evolution of that culture, but we still have that Anglo-Dutch core that we have always had and always enjoyed as a company. Our English and Dutch presence, of course, shapes our history. We had some real challenges, for example, 2004, our reserves crisis, and how that shaped the company thereafter under the leadership of Jeroen van der Veer at the time. All of those actually, I think, create the culture of today's Shell.</p>
</details>

今天的壳牌，我认为被许多人视为一家高度技术驱动、创新驱动的公司。我们有时可能被视为复杂、官僚，这是我们正在努力解决的关键要素之一，以简化公司。所有这些都创造了独特的元素，我们必须从那里开始思考我们未来想走向何方。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Shell today, I think, is seen by many as being a heavily technology-based company, innovation-based company. We can sometimes be seen as complex, bureaucratic, which is one of the key elements we're looking to unwind, to simplify the company. All of that, I think, creates unique elements which we have to start there as we think about where we want to go into the future.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 您想走向何方？您想改变企业文化的哪一部分？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Where do you want to go? What part of the corporate culture would you like to change?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我认为这是关于文化演变，因为其中有很多我希望保留的部分：那种友爱、我们在公司中创造的令人难以置信的安全环境，同时确保我们能够引入绩效纪律和简化这些元素。当我在2001年大学毕业或开始攻读MBA时，我记得第一天有人对我说的一句话，那是在哈佛商学院，院长说：“最好的领导者是思想坚定但心地善良的。”思想坚定但心地善良。我认为我们已经拥有了心地善良的文化，现在我们需要在公司做出的选择上思想坚定，真正专注于那些重要的事情，以及我们能在价值创造和减少排放方面产生最大影响的领域。我认为这是我们改进的空间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look, I think it's about evolving that culture, because there's a lot of it that I'd like to keep held together: the camaraderie, the incredible sort of safe place that we have created in the company, while making sure that we are able to bring those elements of performance, discipline, simplification. When I came out of, or when I started my university, my MBA in 2001, I remember one statement that was said to me on day one. This was at Harvard Business School by the dean. He said, "The best leaders are tough-minded but kind-hearted." Tough-minded but kind-hearted. I think we have a kind-hearted culture already. Now we need to be tough-minded about the choices we make as a company to really focus on the things that matter in the areas where we can create the most impact, both on a value, more value perspective, as well as a less emissions perspective. That's, I think, our scope for improvement.</p>

### 领导力、安全文化与创新：平衡与变革

**Nikolai:** 您如何着手改变它？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you go about changing it?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我认为通过清晰明确。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think by being clear.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 您是一个非常善解人意的人吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Are you a very empathetic person?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我可以非常善解人意，但我也能意识到我可能会在某些领域固步自封。这就是身处“象牙塔”的危险。所以对我来说，最大的解脱就是走出去。我发现当我外出拜访我们的团队时，我能获得最大的能量，感觉最紧密。这从根本上改变了我的心情，因为很容易陷入无休止的会议和理论讨论中。当你身处前线，在海上与那里的员工交谈，建立联系，倾听他们的挑战和机遇时，感觉是完全不同的。所以我发现那是最大的能量来源。因此，我现在不仅将拜访融入日常，而且每个月我都会抽出时间与组织内的员工重新建立联系。我的团队会寻找组织中发生的一些精彩故事，我可以拿起电话打给某人，说：“能多告诉我一些吗？”或者“谢谢你所做的一切。”这些对我来说都非常重要，它们塑造了这家公司的DNA。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I can be incredibly empathetic, but I can also realize that I can lock in in certain areas. That's the danger of being in the Ivory Tower. And so, one of the biggest reprieves for me is getting out there. I find I take the most energy and I feel the most connected when I'm on the road visiting our teams. It fundamentally changes my mood because it's so easy to get stuck in meetings, meetings, meetings and great theoretical discussions. Fundamentally different when you're on the front line offshore, talking to folks there, connecting, listening to what the challenges are and where the opportunities are. And so, I find that that's the biggest energy. And therefore, now I've integrated it not just in terms of visits, but every month I find time to be able to reconnect with people across the organization where my team will look at what are some of the brilliant stories happening in the organization where I can just pick up the phone and call someone and say, "Tell me a bit more about this," or, "Thank you for doing what you're doing." Those areas for me are incredibly important, and that's what creates the DNA of this company.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 能源公司非常注重安全，这是必须的。在钻井平台是这样，但它常常会渗透到整个企业文化，整个集团。所以在总部的一些地方，你上楼梯时必须扶着扶手，因为这样风险较小。你进入停车场时，应该倒车入库，因为早上你没那么累，这样停车风险较小。所有这些事情都渗透到整个企业文化中。壳牌这样的大公司如何才能保持创新和敏捷？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, energy companies are very safety conscious, and you have to be, right? But you have to be it, you know, at the drilling platforms, but it often kind of takes over the whole corporate culture, the whole group, right? So, at the HQ, in some places, you have to hold the handrail when you go up the stairs because it's less risky, right? You come into the parking lot and you're supposed to park with your back to the wall because you are less tired in the morning, so it's less risky to park this way, right? So, all this kind of stuff is just like really permeating the whole corporate culture. How do you make sure that a big company like Shell continues to be innovative and agile?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 说实话，我们仍在学习如何做到这一点。顺便说一句，我们是要求扶着扶手的公司之一，其核心理念是：你扶扶手吗？当我自己扶扶手时，我的孩子们现在也扶扶手了。为什么？因为你很快就会明白，你不能要求一线人员做你自己不愿意做的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're still learning how to do it, if I'm honest with you. We are, by the way, one of the companies that are required to hold the handrail, with the key element of that ethos being, "Do you hold the handrail?" When I hold the handrail, and my kids hold the handrail as well now. And why? Because you learn very quickly that you can't ask the front line to do things that you are not willing to do.</p>
</details>

所以，如果你要求总部的人员扶扶手，我认为归根结底，扶手是其他东西的象征。扶扶手是我们对安全承诺的统一象征。但你的问题仍然成立：有时我们做的事情，在风险特征的背景下，是有限的，你不需要做那件事。扶手已经变得更具象征意义。但如果你有象征性元素，你就会创建一个极其复杂的组织，每个人都走向最低的共同点。那么我们正在为此做些什么呢？我们已经认识到，我们需要为公司的不同部门制定不同的控制框架。我们通常只有一个壳牌控制框架。我们现在正在采用我们称之为壳牌绩效框架的东西，它对业务来说非常独特。如果你在移动出行领域，如果你在销售燃料，那与你在深水钻井的风险特征不同，也与你销售润滑油的风险特征不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, if you're asking folks who should you be holding the handrail in the headquarter, look, I think at the end of the day, the handrail is a proxy for something else. The handrail, holding the handrail, is a proxy for how we are united around our commitment to safety. But your question still holds: sometimes we do things which are, in the context of the risk profile, are limited, you don't need to do that thing, right? And the handrail has become more symbolic. But if you have symbolic elements, you create an incredibly complex organization with everyone going to the lowest common denominator. And so, what are we trying to do around it? We've recognized that we need to have different control frameworks for different parts of the company. We have typically had one Shell control framework. We are now adopting what we call Shell performance framework that is very unique to the business. If you are in mobility, if you are selling fuel, that's a different risk profile to if you are drilling in deepwater, that's a different risk profile to if you are actually selling lubricants.</p>
</details>

所以，我们正在努力构建特定于风险特征的风险框架，了解你的关键风险是什么，然后解放组织。在过去几年中，我最引以为豪的事情之一是，我们过去在安全、环境和资产管理标准中，大约有1700项标准。我们挑战自己，并请专家进来，说你们必须真正减少这些标准，使其变得清晰高效。我们已经将其减少了70%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, what we are trying to do is to build frameworks, risk frameworks, that are specific to the risk profile that's there, understanding what your key risks are, and then liberating the organization. And one of the biggest things I take pride in over the last couple years, we used to have in our safety, environment, and asset management set of standards, we have around 1,700 standards. That's what we had. We have challenged ourselves and brought in the experts to say, "You have to go in and really reduce that to make it sharp and efficient." We've reduced that by 70%.</p>
</details>

这将允许人们说，哪些是必须有的，然后还有一大堆锦上添花的东西，但你需要决定你是否愿意承担。这说起来容易做起来难，因为我们仍然发现，即使我们这样说，人们仍然倾向于旧文化，即“以防万一，还是保留着吧”。所以，这也在于在组织中建立信心和勇气，能够承担自己的风险并管理自己的风险。这是关于真正承担责任并赋予我们员工权力。这不会在六个月内发生，也不会在两年内发生，这是一段多年的旅程，我们正在进行中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That will then allow people to say, "What are the must-haves?" And then here's a whole bunch of nice-to-haves, but you need to decide whether you are willing to take that on. Now, that's easier said than done, because what we still find is, even when we say that, people still defer to the old culture of, "Well, let's just keep them just in case." And so, this is also about building confidence in the organization, courage to be able to take on one's own risk and to be able to manage one's risk. This is about really becoming accountable and allowing our people to become empowered. That doesn't happen in six months, it doesn't happen in two years. This is a journey of multiple years, which we are on.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 但当您拥有一个像这样拥有如此多规则的官僚组织时，您能吸引到合适的人才吗？合适的人才愿意在这样的组织中工作吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But when you have a bureaucratic organization like that with so many rules, do you manage to attract the right type of people? Do the right type of people want to work in an organization like that?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我们是。我们一直很幸运的一点是，我们拥有杰出的人才，并且我们持续吸引着杰出的人才。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We are. One of the things we have been blessed with is we have outstanding people, and we continue to attract outstanding.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 您是如何吸引他们的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you get them?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我认为有几点。首先，壳牌品牌非常强大。我知道，当我加入壳牌时，壳牌品牌有一种吸引想象力的魔力。我们是能源行业的头号品牌。我认为除此之外，我们能够提供涵盖整个能源系统的职业发展机会，无论你是在天然气或石油领域，还是未来销售燃料零售，或在润滑油、化工或研发领域工作，所有这些机会都可获得。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think there's a few things. One is the Shell brand is very, very strong, right? I know it when I joined Shell. There is something about the Shell brand that captivates the imagination. We are the number one brand in the energy sector. I think beyond that, our ability to be able to offer careers that span the entire energy system, whether you are in gas or oil, or tomorrow you're selling fuel retailing, or working in lubricants, or in chemicals, or in research and technology, all of it is available.</p>
</details>

### 人才吸引、职业发展与卓越领导力

**Nikolai:** 好的，Wael Sawan，假设我申请了壳牌的工作，现在进入了最后一轮面试。我非常幸运，将由您这位大人物亲自面试。您会问我什么问题，以判断我是否适合壳牌？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, Sawan, while I have applied for a job in Shell, I'm now in the final interview. I'm really very fortunate because I'm going to be interviewed by the big cheese, and here you are. What do you ask me to see whether I'm fit for Shell?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我认为最重要的一点是，确保这是一家适合您的公司。您是否致力于像这家公司一样，致力于未来能源系统的转型？这是其一。您的价值观是否与公司契合？您所学到的一切对我们都很有趣。我们将培养您所需的所有技术能力，我们将为您提供商业能力，这些都不是我们担心的。我们担心的是文化契合度，以及您能否真正影响公司的发展方向，并确保我们与您契合，就像您与我们契合一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the number one thing is, make sure that this is the right company for you. Are you committed to a future to be able to transform the energy system as this company is trying to do? That's one. Do your values fit with the company? Your ability, everything you've learned is interesting for us. We will form all the technical capabilities that are required to help you. We will give you the commercial capabilities. That's not what we're worried about. It's culture fit and it's ability to be able to actually influence the direction of where this company goes and making sure that we fit you as much as you fit us.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 您让员工频繁调动工作，是每四年换一次新工作吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, you make people change jobs with frequent intervals. Is it every four years people are supposed to try out a new job?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 没有固定的标准，但四年并不罕见。有些人会做八年、九年、十年。例如，我们刚刚宣布我们的移动出行主管将离任，他担任那个职位十年了。这真的取决于具体情况，但四年对于轮岗来说并不罕见。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's no set measure, but four years is not atypical, right? So, some people will do their job for eight years, nine years, 10 years. We just announced, for example, our head of mobility is moving on, having done that job for 10 years. It really depends, but four is not atypical for a rotation.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 我认为这真的很令人印象深刻。您通过这种方式实现了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, which I think is really impressive. What do you achieve by that?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 这有利有弊，所以明确这一点很重要。每四年调动员工的好处是，你创造了真正学习、成长和体验公司不同部门的机会。因为我们是一家多元能源公司，最大的好处之一是让员工了解壳牌“森林”的不同部分，这样他们就能在公司中晋升到更高级别时，将这些部分连接起来。我认为这为年轻员工带来了兴奋感。我们的员工留存率在行业中名列前茅，所以我们知道我们能够留住员工，因为他们得到了激励。但对于某些工作，你需要任期，特别是那些与外部利益相关者相关的职位，你需要在一个国家被利益相关者所熟知；某些需要公司历史知识的职位，例如研发领域。所以，我们需要管理好这些不同的部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look, there's pros and cons to it, and that's why it's important to be very specific. The beauty of moving people out every four years is you create opportunities to really learn and to grow and to experience different parts of the company. And because we are a multi-energy company, one of the biggest benefits is allowing people to understand the different parts of the Shell forest so that they can actually connect those parts together as they become more senior in the company. I think it creates excitement for young staff. Our retention rates are amongst the highest in the industry, and so we know we're able to keep staff because they get motivated. But for certain jobs, you need tenure, particular jobs that are connected, let's say, to external stakeholders, where you need to be in the country and be known to the stakeholders. Certain jobs where corporate history is important, such as, for example, in research and development. So, there's different parts which we need to be able to also manage.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 谈到领导力，对您来说，什么是好的领导力？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moving on to leadership, what is good leadership to you?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我认为它始于拥有学习的渴望和谦逊。因为我认为这份工作最大的危险之一，随着你在大多数工作中变得越来越资深，就是你开始确信自己真的懂很多东西。那是一个危险的境地。我们周围的世界正以令人难以置信的速度发展。现在，改变是艰难的，但也是不可避免的。因此，领导者需要能够反映这种内部和外部的变化。所以对我来说，学习的渴望和意识，以及能够定期影响你所学习的生态系统，是领导力的一个关键要素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it starts with having the appetite and the humility to learn. Because I think one of the biggest dangers in this job, as you become more and more senior in most jobs actually, is the conviction that you start to actually know stuff. That is a dangerous space to be. The world around us is moving at an incredibly fast pace. Now, change is hard, but it's also inevitable. And therefore, leaders need to be able to reflect that change both internally and externally. And so, to me, the appetite to learn and the awareness to be able to then influence that ecosystem around which you are learning on a regular basis is a critical element of leadership.</p>
</details>

我认为另一个要素是，我在上任几个月后意识到，你有很多假设支撑着我们所有的观点。我在壳牌工作了26年，学到了很多东西，这些塑造了我对能源系统以及未来可能或不可能发展的技术的思考。你必须小心，不要让这些假设束缚你的思想，让你变得好斗，坚持“不，我的真理是唯一的真理”。这是我今天在许多讨论中看到的问题之一，不是我的真理，就是你的真理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think another element is, I recognized a few months into my job that you have a whole bunch of assumptions which underlie every view we have, right? I have 26 years in Shell that I've learned multiple things, and that that forms my own thinking on the energy system and on what are the likely technologies to evolve tomorrow or what will be unlikely to evolve. One has to be careful that those assumptions do not lock one's head in and you become almost combative in saying, "No, no, my truth is the only truth." That's one of the issues I see today in many of the discussions I have, it's either my truth or your truth.</p>
</details>

### 终身学习、使命感与从错误中成长

**Nikolai:** 如果您能在大脑中植入一套新的技能，那会是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you could implant a new skill set into your brain, what would it be?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我很想更多地了解核聚变及其发展方向。我在这方面没有太多背景知识，所以很多都是出于好奇，我正在学习。人工智能是另一个我花了很多时间研究的领域，就是阅读书籍。我刚读了**Mustafa Suleyman**（Mustafa Suleyman: DeepMind联合创始人，著有《即将到来的浪潮》）的《**The Coming Wave**》（The Coming Wave: Mustafa Suleyman所著，探讨人工智能和生物技术对人类未来的影响），它引人入胜，因为我们正处于一个将从根本上改变的不仅仅是能源系统，而是整个世界的临界点。所以我很想学得比现在快得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'd love to be able to get a lot more understanding of fusion nuclear and where that is going. I don't have a lot of background in that space, so a lot of it is curiosity, and I'm learning. AI is another one that I've been spending quite some time on, just reading books. I just read Mustafa Suleyman's The Coming Wave. It's intriguing because we're at the cusp of something that's going to fundamentally change not just the energy system, the entire world. So, I'd love to learn much faster than I'm currently learning.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 我们都一样。现在这些都是非常大的话题。您如何将这种使命感灌输给您的员工？因为内在动力是满足感和幸福感最重要的驱动力等等。您如何将这种动力植入公司？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Don't we all? Now, these are very big topics. Now, how do you get this sense of purpose into your employees? Because intrinsic motivation is the most important driver for satisfaction and happiness and so on. And how do you install that into the company?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我认为有两个要素。首先是确保公司的宗旨足够广泛和崇高，让人们能够与之产生共鸣。其次是认识到我们每个人都有不同的目标。我们能做的最重要的事情就是拥有优秀的团队领导者，因为团队领导者实际上帮助我们的员工与公司的宗旨建立联系，更重要的是，帮助个人找到自己的宗旨。我曾遇到过帮助我做到这一点的领导者，他们会说：“实际上，公司想走向这里，但先放一边，你想做什么？什么在驱动你？是你的孩子吗？你的孩子在驱动你走向什么？你想向他们证明什么？你想向自己证明什么？”所以我们花了很多时间来培养这支团队领导干部队伍，这是我们每年进行壳牌全体员工调查时关注的头号指标：我们的团队领导力质量如何，以及需要采取哪些干预措施来帮助这些团队领导者做得更好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's two elements, I think. One is making sure that the purpose of the company is broad enough and noble enough that people can connect to it. But then secondly, recognizing that each of us will have a different purpose. Biggest thing we can do is to have great team leaders, because team leaders actually help our employees connect both to the company purpose, but even more importantly, help individuals find their own purpose. I've had leaders who have helped me with that, to say, "Actually, here's where the company wants to go, but put that aside for a minute. What do you want to do? What is driving you? Is it your kids? And what is it about what your kids are driving you towards? What is it that you want to prove to them? What is it that you want to prove to yourself?" And so, we spend a lot of time building that cadre of team leadership, and that's the number one metric that we look for every single year when we do our overall Shell people survey results. It's, "How is the quality of our team leadership, and where are interventions required to help those team leaders be better?"</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 当人们犯错时，您如何反应？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you react when people make mistakes?</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 我认为你必须接受从错误中学习。我不得不说，我在工作中反应得更好，因为我已经习惯了，而在家里，当我的儿子做错事时，我就会说：“拜托，我们以前谈过这个。”但我知道那样是错的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think you have to embrace the learning around mistakes, right? I have to say, I react much better at work because I'm conditioned to than at home. When my son does something wrong, I'm like, "Come on, we've talked about this before." But I know that's wrong.</p>
</details>

**Nikolai:** 但您的黎巴嫩背景中不是有点脾气吗？那不是一种相当……

<p class="english-text">But is there not like a bit of temper in your Lebanese background? Isn't that quite a...</p>
</details>

**Wael Sawan:** 实际上恰恰相反。当你经历了很多事情之后，比如说，我曾在2006年不得不带着我的妻子和儿子从轰炸中撤离，1982年我们曾是难民，不得不穿越叙利亚边境。当你有了这些经历之后，如果有人因为财务问题或其他事情让你心烦，生活中还有比担心犯错或类似事情更大的事情。你每天都感谢上帝赐予你的一切，然后你会说：“好吧，我们能做些什么？”这就是我喜欢我们公司的地方，总的来说，当事情出错时，每个人都会齐心协力解决问题。对我来说，这是我留在公司的重要原因。我加入这家公司时，本打算把它作为简历上的一笔，学点东西，然后一年内就离开。结果26、27年后，我仍然在这里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Actually, it's the opposite. When you've gone through a lot, right? So, I've had to evacuate my wife and my son from reigning bombs in 2006. We were refugees in 1982 when we had to go through the Syrian border. When you've had those experiences and somebody upsets you with a financial issue or the like, life is there much bigger things than being worried about a mistake or the like. You thank God every day for what you have, and then you sort of say, "Okay, what can we do?" And that's what I like about our company. By and large, when something goes wrong, everyone comes together to be able to actually solve the issue. And that to me is a big reason why I stayed in the company. I mean, this is a company I joined with the idea of wanting to get it on my CV, learn a bit, and leave within a year. And 26, 27 years later, I'm still around.</p>

<p class="english-text">I do have time to read. I do my daily reading, I do my weekly reading, so publications and the like. And then I'll do my books typically when I'm traveling. I go back to my favorite Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet, which whenever I'm going through a phase where I just...</p>

**Wael Sawan:** 很高兴他来自一个离我母亲在黎巴嫩长大的村庄不远的地方。但更具体地说，那本书让我能够从自我中抽离出来，去思考社会以及我在塑造社会中的更广泛作用。特别是现在，当我反思自己的孩子时，他在书中谈到：“你的孩子不是你的孩子，他们通过你而来。”这非常有力。当我的儿子开始准备上大学时，你如何放手？现在你已经尽力了，他现在是自己的主人了，你努力支持他走过这段旅程。所以在那些反思的时刻，我认为那本书将我从硬核的数字、工程学带回到哲学和生活，这并不是一个坏主意。

<p class="english-text">It's nice that he comes from a village that's not too far away from where my mother grew up in Lebanon. But more specifically, that book to me was one where it allowed me to sort of move away from self to actually society and my broader role within shaping society. Particularly when I'm reflected, for example, now around my own kids, where he in his book he talks about, "Your kids are not your kids, they come through you." And that's very powerful. As my son starts to prepare to go to university, how do you let him go? Now you've done what you can, he's his own man now, and you try to support him through that journey. So, in those times of reflection, I think that book moves me from what is hardcore numbers, engineering, back to philosophy and life, which is not a bad idea.</p>

<p class="english-text">And, what is your best advice to your three sons and all the young people who listen to this podcast generally?</p>

**Wael Sawan:** 我想我的儿子们已经听腻了我说的这句话了，那就是如何让他们成为最好的自己。我的每个儿子都不同，实际上，我和我的妻子都对他们之间的差异感到震惊。所以，我最大的任务就是如何帮助他们每个人成为最好的自己。我认为我们能做到的最棒的事情是，如果你能让人们在几件事情上真正做到出色，那绝对没问题。会有其他人来补充他们的技能，但要确保他们在几件事情上是特别的。我最大的任务就是帮助他们每个人找到那一两件特别的事情。

<p class="english-text">My sons are, I think, sick and tired of hearing me say this. It's how to make them the best version of themselves. Every single one of my sons is different. Actually, it's shocking to me and my wife how different they are. So, my biggest job is, how do I help each one of them be the best version of themselves? I think what's great about what we can do is, if you can have people who are truly special at a couple of things, that's absolutely fine. You have others who will complement their skills, but make sure that they are special at a few things. And my biggest job is to help them find what those one or two things for each of them is.</p>
