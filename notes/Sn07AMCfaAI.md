title: 听觉错觉：大脑如何塑造我们所听到的世界

### 听觉的复杂性：不仅仅是频率检测

我想让你听听这两种声音，然后判断哪一个音调更高。这是声音A（发出嗡嗡声），这是声音B（发出嗡嗡声）。对我来说，声音A显然更高，但这很奇怪，因为声音A只是一个100**赫兹**（Hertz: 频率单位，表示每秒的周期数）的**正弦波**（Sine wave: 一种纯净的、单一频率的波形）。声音B也有相同的100赫兹频率，但还包含了150赫兹和200赫兹的频率。所以我们添加了更高的频率，但声音却更低了。这是怎么回事呢？

<p class="english-text">I want you to listen to these two sounds and decide which is higher. So this is sound A. (sample sound buzzing) And this is sound B. (sample sound buzzing) Okay, so to me, sound A is clearly higher, but that's strange because sound A was just a 100 hertz sine wave. Sound B had that same 100 hertz frequency, but also 150 hertz and 200 hertz. So we added higher frequencies, but the sound was lower. How does that work?</p>
</details>

我认为有一种观点认为，我们的耳朵只是简单地检测环境中20赫兹到20,000赫兹之间的振动频率。但听觉远不止于此。在这个视频中，我们将通过一系列听觉错觉来阐明我们的听觉是如何实际运作的。这些效果中的大多数都可以在手机或笔记本电脑扬声器上实现，但如果你手边有耳机，我建议你戴上它们以获得完整的体验。

<p class="english-text">I think there's this idea that what our ears do is simply detect the frequency of vibrations in our environment that are between 20 hertz and 20,000 hertz. But there is so much more to hearing than that. And in this video, we're gonna go through a series of audio illusions that illustrate how our sense of hearing actually works. Most of these effects will work on a phone or laptop speakers, but if you have headphones handy, well, I'd recommend putting them on for the full experience.</p>

### 悉尼市政厅管风琴与缺失的基频

这就像一个全身乐器，不是吗？是的，绝对是。这是悉尼市政厅的管风琴。它建于1890年，曾是世界上最大的管风琴。我以前没有意识到的是，管风琴旨在听起来像许多不同的乐器一起演奏。管风琴就像一个人的管弦乐队。听起来非常像长笛，对吧？是的，你可以听出来。把它和小号、双簧管的声音比较一下。所以你可以在管风琴上听到所有这些管弦乐的声音。我们也可以进入乐器内部。我们要去看看吗？我们去看看吧。好的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's like a whole body instrument, isn't it? - Absolutely yeah, yeah. - This is the Sydney Town Hall pipe organ. When it was built in 1890, it was the largest organ in the world. Something I didn't realize about organs is that they were meant to sound like many different instruments playing together. - Organs are sort of a one person orchestra. Very flutie, right? - Yeah. - You can tell. Compare that to a trumpet. Oboe sound. So you can hear all these orchestral sounds on the organ. We could get inside the instrument too. - Should we go look? - Let's have a look. Yeah. - Okay.</p>
</details>

对于每种乐器，管风琴中都有一系列风管，它们为该乐器演奏所有不同的音符。我的意思是，这架管风琴有8000根风管。8000根？8000根，是的。为什么需要这么多？为了创造管弦乐队所有不同的声音。你在外面看到的只是管风琴本身的一小部分。哇，看看这些。它们都藏在这里面。是的，有些是木制的，有些是金属的。有些底部有共鸣器，可以发出更像簧片的声音，更像铜管乐器的声音。但这些木制的则更多是深沉的长笛声。

<details>

<p class="english-text">For each instrument, there are a series of pipes in the organ which play all the different notes for that instrument. - I mean, there are 8,000 pipes in this organ. - 8,000? - 8,000, yeah. - Why do you need that many? - To create all the different sounds of the orchestra. - What you see on the outside is just a tiny fraction of the organ itself. Whoa look at all these. They're all hidden in here. - [Titus] They are, yeah. And some are wooden, some are metal. Some have resonators at the bottom of them to create the more reedy sounds, the brassy sounds. But then these wooden ones are more of the deep flutie sounds as well.</p>
</details>

这是一个键盘吗？是的，这是一个键盘。一个风管的键盘布局。非常好，你把自己摆放得很好。当两根相同长度的风管振动时，它们都会发出相同的音符。这是因为它们都产生相同的**基频**（Fundamental frequency: 声音中最低且通常振幅最大的频率），这是它们产生最低且通常振幅最大的振动。但如果风管由不同材料制成，它们听起来就会不同。所以你可以分辨出它们是不同的乐器，这是因为每一种乐器都产生一组独特的更高频率，称为**泛音**（Overtones: 比基频高的频率）。它们不像基频那么响亮，我们也不会把它们听成独立的音调，但它们会影响声音的质量，这被称为**音色**（Timbre: 声音的特质或品质）。这就是你如何区分小号和长笛的原因。它们有不同频率和相对振幅的泛音。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is like what a keyboard? - It's a keyboard. Yeah, that's right. A keyboard layout of pipes. - Very nice you position yourself well... - When two pipes of the same length vibrate, they both play the same note. That's because they're both producing the same fundamental frequency that is the lowest and usually highest amplitude vibration they produce. But if the pipes are made of different materials, they will sound different. So you can tell they are different instruments, and that's because each one produces a distinct set of higher frequencies called overtones. They're not as loud as the fundamental, and we don't hear them as distinct tones, but they affect the quality of the sound called timbre. It's how you can tell apart a trumpet from say a flute.</p>
</details>

对于许多乐器来说，最常见的泛音是基频的整数倍。这些被称为**谐波**（Harmonics: 基频的整数倍频率）。如果这是你的基音，你将听到的音符会是……所有这些音符都在那个基音之内。现在，当你试图演奏非常低的音符时，谐波会很有用。悉尼市政厅管风琴是世界上仅有的两架拥有64英尺长风管的管风琴之一。它实际上太大了，不得不折叠起来。64英尺的风管在哪里？我们能看到它吗？你问了一个我不知道的宏大问题。我知道它就在这里某个地方。就像这里有一大块木头。哦，是的。会是它吗？这根风管用于产生8赫兹的频率。当你达到那个水平时，你更多的是感觉而不是听到。当然。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They have overtones of different frequencies and relative amplitudes. For a lot of instruments, the most common overtones are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. These are known as harmonics. - If this was your fundamental note, the notes that you're gonna be hearing with it would be... So all of those notes are within that fundamental note. - Now, harmonics can be useful when you're trying to play really low notes. The Sydney Town Hall pipe organ is one of only two in the world that has a 64 foot long pipe. - It's actually so large that it has to be folded over itself. - Where is the 64? Can we see it? - You've got the grand question that I don't know. I know it's somewhere here. - Like that's a really big chunk of wood right here. - Oh, yeah. - Could that be it? This pipe is used to produce a frequency of 8 hertz. - When you get to that level, it's more something that you feel rather than something that you hear. - For sure.</p>
</details>

大多数大型管风琴能演奏的最低音是16赫兹，这刚好是人类听觉的极限。但即使这样也需要一根32英尺长的风管，这对于许多管风琴来说太大或太昂贵了。你知道32英尺的风管在哪里吗？嗯……它们是前面的那些吗？它们就是你前面看到的那些。那个。那就是32英尺的风管。是的。所以那将近10米。将近10米。是的。从顶部看，这实际上相当令人恐惧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The lowest note most big pipe organs can play is 16 hertz, which is just at the limit of human hearing. But even this requires a 32 foot pipe, which is too big or expensive for many organs. Do you know where the 32 footers are? - Well... - They're ones out the front? - They're the ones that you see at the front. That one. - That's the 32 footer. - Yeah. - So that's nearly 10 meters. - Nearly 10 meters. Yeah. It's pretty scary to think about from the top of it actually.</p>
</details>

在18世纪的欧洲，Georg Joseph Vogler是一位受欢迎的管风琴演奏家。他想巡演欧洲大陆，但这需要建造一个紧凑便携的管风琴，以便他可以随身携带。我们显然无法拖着巨大的32英尺风管来产生16赫兹的频率。那么，他如何才能仍然创造出使管风琴如此强大的低频声音呢？Vogler意识到，如果他使用较短的风管演奏16赫兹的谐波，你的大脑就会听到这个**缺失的基频**（Missing fundamental: 即使基频本身不存在，大脑也能根据谐波推断出的基音）。我们可以试试这个技巧，看看它听起来怎么样？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In 18th century Europe, Georg Joseph Vogler was a popular organist. He wanted to tour the continent, but that would require building a compact portable organ that he could take with him on the road. And we obviously couldn't haul around the huge 32 foot pipe required to produce 16 hertz. So how could he still create the low frequencies that make the organ so powerful? Well, Vogler realized that if he played the harmonics of 16 hertz using shorter pipes, your brain would hear this missing fundamental. Can we try the trick and see if it sounds?</p>
</details>

是的，当然。五度音是那种最常见的基频，你会听到它来获得低沉的声音，但基本上，五度音与16英尺的风管一起使用，它会产生更低的合成音。所以那只是16英尺的金属风管。这很有趣，因为你添加它，我却没有听到它升高。你演奏的是高五度音。是的。但我听到它下降了。就像你把它抽出来，我就觉得，哦，音符下降了。这就是诀窍。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, sure. The fifth is that sort of most common fundamental, which you're gonna hear to get the low sound, but basically the quint gets used with a 16 foot and it creates the lower resultant tone. So that's just the 16 metal. - It's so funny because you add it and I do not hear it going up. You're playing a fifth above. - Yes - But I'm hearing it go down. Like you just pull that out and I'm like, oh yeah, the note dropped. - That's the trick. Yeah.</p>
</details>

我一开始播放的两种声音，第一种是纯粹的100赫兹（发出嗡嗡声）。但第二种声音是由50赫兹的谐波组成的（发出嗡嗡声）。所以你实际上听到了这个基频，即使它不存在。这就是为什么如果高频是低基频的谐波，它们加在一起听起来会比低频更低。现在，这可能不像看起来那么奇怪。如果你看一下谐波的波形，你会发现添加高频会改变声音的周期。它使周期变长，从而实际上与缺失的基频相同。如果你重新创造一些谐波音高，你实际上会使声音的低音更突出。所以，你可以演奏谐波，即使你没有演奏基频，也能听到基频。没错，是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">With the two sounds I played at the beginning, the first was a pure 100 hertz. (sample sound buzzing) But the second sound was made up of the harmonics of 50 hertz. (sample sound buzzing) So you actually heard this fundamental frequency, even though it wasn't there. That's how higher frequencies together can sound lower than low frequencies if they are harmonics of a low fundamental. Now, this might not be as weird as it seems. If you look at the wave form of the harmonics, you find that adding the higher frequencies changes the period of the sound. It makes the period longer so that it's actually the same as the missing fundamental. - If you kind of recreate some of those harmonic pitches, you're actually gonna bring out more bass in the sound. - So, the idea of like you could play the harmonics and hear the fundamental even if you're not playing the fundamental. - That's right. Yeah.</p>

### 谢泼德音调：永无止境的上升

不同频率的声音可以结合起来创造出不存在的音符，但它们也可以做一些更奇怪的事情。你好，我是马里奥。在《超级马里奥64》中，有一个似乎永无止境的楼梯。玩家必须收集足够的金币才能升级。现在仔细听音乐。音阶听起来好像一直在上升，就像那个无尽的楼梯一样。这就是**谢泼德音调错觉**（Shepard tone illusion: 一种听觉错觉，使音高听起来永无止境地升高），这里是它本身的**谢泼德滑音**（Shepard Glissando: 连续的谢泼德音调）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So different frequency sounds can combine to make notes that aren't there, but they can also do something, even stranger. - Hello, it's me, Mario. - In Super Mario 64, there's a staircase that seems to go on forever. Players can't level up until they collect enough coins. Now listen carefully to the music. The scale sounds like it keeps going up and up and up, just like the endless staircase. This is the Shepard tone illusion, and here's a Shepard Glissando on its own. (music escalating)</p>
</details>

一个不断升高的音调应该是不可能的，因为我们无法听到超过20,000赫兹的极限，然而这种声音却一直在持续，不断上升。诀窍在于谢泼德音调不仅仅是一个音符。有多个频率在同时播放，所有这些频率都相隔八度。所有这些频率都在增加，但随着它们的增加，它们的音量也会改变。所以高音变得更安静，低音变得更响亮。高音很快就会消失，新的低音则会逐渐出现。这给人一种音高不断上升的错觉，就像理发店的旋转杆的音频版本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">An ever increasing tone should be impossible because we can't hear anything beyond the 20,000 hertz limit, and yet this sound keeps going, always ascending. The trick is a Shepard tone isn't just one note. There are multiple frequencies being played, all separated by octaves. All of these frequencies are increasing, but as they do, their volumes change. So the high notes get quieter, and the low notes get louder. High notes soon fade out, and new low notes are faded in. This gives the illusion of an ever rising pitch, like the audio version of a barbershop pole.</p>
</details>

谢泼德音调也可以在某些听众中引起情感或生理反应。2016年的一项研究发现，在听完谢泼德音调后，参与者报告感到紧张、焦虑和不安。也许这就是为什么在电影《敦刻尔克》中一场激烈的轰炸场景中，谢泼德音调出现在伴随的配乐中。希望这不会让你感到不安，但我想让你尝试找出这是哪首著名的曲子，所有音符都保持不变，但它们被混入了不同的八度音阶（发出蜂鸣声）。你认出这首歌了吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shepard tones can also evoke emotional or physical responses in some listeners. A 2016 study found that after listening to Shepard tones, participants reported feeling nervous, anxious, and disturbed. Perhaps that's why during an intense bombing scene in the film, "Dunkirk" Shepard tones feature in the accompanying score. Hopefully this won't make you uneasy, but I want you to try to figure out which well-known tune, this is, all of the notes have been kept the same, but they've been mixed up into different octaves. (sound beeping) Did you recognize the song?</p>

### 大脑的模式识别：幻影词与蒙德格林

嗯，这是未打乱的旋律（发出蜂鸣声）。但现在你听过之后，你能跟着打乱的版本吗（发出蜂鸣声）？对我来说，第二次听到打乱的旋律时，曲调似乎很明显，这与第一次听到的感觉非常不同。我们的大脑也能在随机的声音中找到模式。这是由Dr. Diana Deutsch创造的**幻影词错觉**（Phantom word illusion: 在重复的或模糊的声音中听到不存在的词语）。听这段音频，试着找出正在说的词。你可以在评论中写下你听到的内容。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, here is the unscrambled melody. (sound beeping) But now that you've heard that, can you follow the scrambled version? (sound beeping) To me, it's fascinating how the second time I heard the scrambled melody, the tune seemed obvious, which is very different from how it sounded the first time. Our brains can find patterns in random sounds too. This is the phantom word illusion created by Dr. Diana Deutsch. Listen to this audio and try to figure out which words are being said. You can put what you heard in the comments.</p>
</details>

当一个说话者说一个词时，第二个说话者同时说一个不同的词。根据Dr. Deutsch的说法，因为信号在到达你的耳朵之前在空气中混合，你得到了一堆声音可供选择，所以你可以在脑海中创造词语。我们听到的大部分内容不取决于声音的频率，而取决于我们的大脑如何处理它们。Dr. Deutsch注意到，当她在考试周附近播放这种错觉时，学生们报告听到“没脑子”、“我累了”或“没时间”之类的词。我们实际上可以**预设**（Prime: 通过预先接触某些信息来影响后续的感知或行为）大脑去听到我们想听到的东西。例如，使用文本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When one speaker plays a word, the second speaker plays a different word at the same time. According to Dr. Deutsch, because the signals are mixed in the air before they reach your ears, you're given a pile of sounds to choose from, so you can create words in your mind. A lot of what we hear depends not on the frequencies of sound, but on how our brains process them. Dr. Deutsch noticed that when she played this illusion near exam week, students reported hearing words like, "No brain," "I'm tired," or "No time." And we can actually prime the brain to hear what we want it to hear. For example, using text.</p>
</details>

以人群唱歌为例（人群唱歌）。你被预设去听到你看到的歌词。这些被称为**蒙德格林**（Mondegreens: 因误听而产生的歌词或短语），源于一首被误听的诗，其中有一句“他们杀害了阿穆雷伯爵和蒙德格林夫人”。然而在真正的诗中，伯爵独自死去，他的杀手实际上把他“放在草地上”（laid him on the green）。有时蒙德格林发生是因为声音被逻辑上但错误地划分了，例如听到“小鸡惊喜”（pullet surprise）而不是**普利策奖**（Pulitzer Prize: 美国新闻、文学和音乐领域的最高奖项）。语言的熟悉度会帮助你从一开始就听到正确的那个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Take the case of this crowd chanting. (crowd chanting) You're primed to hear the lyrics you see. These are called Mondegreens, after a misheard poem in which there's a line, "They have slain the Earl Amurray and Lady Mondegreen." Except in the real poem, the Earl dies alone and his killers actually laid him on the green. Sometimes mondegreens happen when sounds are divided logically, but incorrectly, such as hearing pullet surprise instead of Pulitzer Prize. Language familiarity would help you hear the correct one from the start.</p>

所以，虽然英国足球迷可能会听到常见的“那太令人尴尬了”的口号（人群喊叫：那太令人尴尬了），但美国足球迷可能不会。更令人惊讶的是，微妙的视觉线索如何影响我们所听到的。我在这段视频中说了什么？如果你听到“bear”（熊），那是因为我说的就是这个词。但我在这个视频中说了什么？现在我敢打赌你听到了“fair”（公平），但如果你不看画面回放这两个视频，你会发现它们的音频完全相同。我们只改变了嘴巴的动作，我可以通过同时播放这两个视频来向你证明这一点。你听到的内容会根据你关注哪个视频而改变。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So while UK football fans might hear the common chant that is embarrassing. - [Crowd] That is embarrassing. - An American football fan might not. What's even more amazing is how subtle visual cues can affect what we hear. What am I saying in this clip? If you heard the word bear, that's because that's what I was saying. But what am I saying in this clip? Now I bet you heard fair, but if you play back both those clips without looking, you'll find it's the exact same audio. All we changed was the mouth movement, and I can prove it to you by playing those two clips at the same time. And what you hear will change depending on which clip you focus on.</p>
</details>

所以我们看到的东西会影响我们听到的东西。反之亦然。在这个错觉中，如果没有声音播放，看起来两个圆圈是相互穿过的，但当它们相交时发出声音（球冲刺声），立刻就好像它们相互弹开了（球冲刺声）。我们看到和听到的东西是内在联系的。因为在现实世界中，一种感官可以可靠地告知另一种感官。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what we see affects what we hear. And the reverse is also true. In this illusion if no sound is played, it looks like the two circles are passing through each other, but at a sound when they intersect (balls dashing) and immediately it seems like they're bouncing off each other. (balls dashing) What we see and hear are intrinsically linked. Because in the real world, one sense can reliably inform the other.</p>

### 鸡尾酒会效应与声音定位

但如果没有视觉线索可供参考呢？在1950年代，空中交通管制员在同一个房间里同时与多名飞行员进行通信。不幸的是，所有飞行员的信息都从一个扬声器播放，重叠的音频使得很难只挑出一种声音。于是研究人员开始研究所谓的**鸡尾酒会效应**（Cocktail party effect: 在嘈杂环境中专注于特定声音的能力），因为这个问题类似于在嘈杂的房间里专注于一个声音。我们大多数人都能毫不费力地做到这一点，但这是怎么做到的呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But what if there are no visual cues to go on? In the 1950s, air traffic controllers were communicating with multiple pilots simultaneously in the same room. Unfortunately, messages from all of the pilots would play from a single loudspeaker, and the overlapping audio made it really difficult to pick out just one voice. So researchers started looking into the so-called cocktail party effect, because this problem resembled focusing on a single voice in a noisy room. Most of us can do this with little effort, but how?</p>
</details>

这有点像录下整个派对的声音，然后提取出特定声音的波形。声波在到达你的耳朵之前会相互干扰。所以这应该是一项困难的任务。在这段录音中，试着在这群人中找出谈论航班的声音（人群说话声）。我觉得这真的很难，但如果你先听到那个声音，那么接下来的对话就更容易理解了（人群说话声）。这要容易得多，因为你可以根据上下文和语言结构预测接下来会出现什么词。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's kind of like taking the recording of the entire party and pulling out a particular voices waveform. The sound waves interfere with each other before reaching your ears. So this should be a difficult task. In this recording, try to find the voice talking about a flight in this crowd. (crowd talking) I find that really hard, but if you hear the voice first, then the rest of the conversation is easier to follow, (crowd talking) This is much easier because you can predict what words will come next based on context and language structure.</p>
</details>

我们专注于一个声音的第二种方式是通过识别声音的来源。再听一遍，但这次专注于你左耳播放的飞行员声音（人群说话声）。在鸡尾酒会中，你可以通过忽略来自其他位置的声音来专注于你的朋友。一旦研究人员意识到这一点，他们就主张通过分散在控制室内的不同扬声器广播不同的飞行员声音。这使得空中交通管制员能够更成功地调谐到他们的飞行员。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second way we can focus on one voice is by identifying where the sound is coming from. Listen again, but this time focus on the pilot played in your left ear. (crowd talking) In a cocktail party, you can focus on your friend by ignoring sounds that come from other locations. Once researchers realized this, they advocated that different pilots be broadcast through different speakers, spread out throughout the control room. This allowed air traffic controllers to more successfully tune in to their pilot.</p>
</details>

但我们到底是如何定位声音来源的呢？嗯，我将蒙上眼睛，让我妻子在我周围走动并在不同位置拍手，我将尝试指向声音的位置。所以我们来试试看。通常你可以将声音精确定位到一两度以内。实际上有四个不同的线索可以帮助我识别声音的位置。怎么样？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But how do we actually locate the source of a sound? Well, I'm gonna put on this blindfold and ask my wife to walk around me and clap in different locations, and I am going to try to point to the location of the sound. So let's give it a try. Normally you can pinpoint a sound to within a degree or two. And there are actually four different cues that help me identify the location of the sound. How is it?</p>
</details>

第一个是音量。右边的声音在我的右耳会更响亮。我的头会在我的左耳上投下声音阴影。第二个线索是，这个阴影对高频的衰减比对低频的衰减更厉害。这有点像你的邻居在开派对。你听不到高频的声音，比如歌词，但你能听到低音，因为低频受距离和障碍物的衰减较小。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first is volume. A sound on my right will be louder in my right ear. My head sort of casts a sound shadow over my left ear. And the second cue is that this shadow attenuates higher frequencies more than low frequencies. It's kinda like when your neighbor is having a party. You can't really hear the high frequencies like the lyrics, but you can hear the bass because low frequencies are less attenuated by distance and obstacles.</p>
</details>

第三个是时间延迟。声音穿过你的头部需要半毫秒，所以声音通常会先到达一只耳朵，然后再到达另一只耳朵。听你左边的蜂鸣声（发出蜂鸣声），然后是你右边的蜂鸣声（发出蜂鸣声）。现在，随着这两个蜂鸣声之间的延迟缩短（发出蜂鸣声），它就不再是回声，而更像是一个真正来自你左边的声音（发出蜂鸣声）。我们用来识别声音来源的第四个线索是声音在波周期的哪个点到达每只耳朵，或者说波的相位。它是到达波峰还是波谷？一只耳朵的波相位通常会与另一只耳朵的相位不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The third is time delay. It takes a sound half a millisecond to cross your head, so sound will usually arrive at one ear before the other. Listen to a beep on your left. (sound beeping) and then on your right. (sound beeping) Now, as the delay between those two beeps is shortened, (ound beeping) it's less of an echo and more just one sound that's really on your left. (sound beeping) The fourth cue we use to identify the source of a sound is at what point in the wave cycle the sound arrives at each ear or the phase of the wave. Is it arriving at a peak or a trough? The phase of the wave at one ear will typically be different than the phase at the other ear.</p>
</details>

现在，当声音直接在你前方或后方，或者在你头部中间穿过的任何垂直平面上的任何点时，你会遇到一些麻烦。这是因为声音到你两只耳朵的距离是相同的。因此，那四个线索并不是很有用。猫头鹰通过不对称的耳朵解决了这个问题。它们的左耳实际上比右耳低。所以来自下方的声音在它们的左耳会更响亮。人类通常有对称的耳朵，但它们的形状很重要。这就是你耳朵的外部部分发挥作用的地方。我的意思是，我们通常称之为耳朵的部分。技术上这被称为**耳廓**（Pinna: 外耳，由软骨和皮肤组成）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now you run into a bit of trouble when the sound is either directly in front or behind you or on any point in a vertical plane that passes through the middle of your head. And that's because the distance from the sound to both of your ears is the same. And therefore, those four cues aren't very useful. Owls solve this issue with asymmetrical ears. Their left ear is actually lower on their head than their right ear. So sounds from below are louder in their lower left ear. Humans typically have symmetric ears, but their shapes are important. This is where the outer part of your ear comes in. I mean, what we'd normally just refer to as the ear. Technically this is called the pinna.</p>

根据声音的位置和频率，它会从你耳朵上的这些隆起和凹凸处反弹，最终进入你的耳内，实际上进入耳膜。这些反射实际上会根据位置不同地改变一些频率。科学家们在志愿者的耳朵内放置微型麦克风来测量这一点。他们可以看到，例如，一个位于你上方的6000赫兹的声音可能会被放大10**分贝**（Decibels: 声音强度单位），但同一个位于你下方的声音则会被衰减10分贝。这些数字取决于你耳朵中软骨独特的隆起和凹凸。所以每个人的耳朵对不同位置的不同频率都有独特的响应曲线。在我们的一生中，我们的大脑会学习不同频率如何从我们的耳朵反射，我们利用这些信息来识别声音的来源。

<p class="english-text">Depending on the location and the frequency of sound, it will bounce off these ridges and bumps on your ear and end up inside your ear actually going into the eardrum. And those reflections will actually change some frequencies differently than others depending on the location. Scientists placed tiny microphones inside volunteer's ears to measure this. They could see, for example, that a 6,000 hertz sound located above you might be amplified by 10 decibels, but that same sound below you would be attenuated by 10 decibels. These figures depend on the unique bumps and ridges of cartilage in your ear. So each person's ears have a unique response curve to different frequencies at different locations. And over the course of our lives, our brains learn the way different frequencies reflect off our ears, and we use that information to identify the source of the sound.</p>

现在，每个人的耳廓形状都是独一无二的。那么如果我们的耳朵改变了呢？在1998年的一项研究中，研究人员将小模具放入一组参与者的耳朵中，改变了他们耳廓的形状。这是一名受试者的数据。刚性背景网格代表声音实际播放的位置。点是受试者的猜测，深色扭曲网格是这些猜测的平均值。在研究之前，他们相当擅长定位声音，但在改变耳廓形状后，他们变得非常糟糕。经过几天和几周的适应，参与者都调整过来，变得更擅长定位声音。所以这是你的大脑可以适应的东西。

<p class="english-text">Now, every person has a unique pinna shape. So what if our ears changed? In a 1998 study, researchers placed small molds into the ears of a group of participants changing the shape of their pinnas. Here's one subject's data. The rigid background grid represents where sounds were actually played. The dots are the subject's guesses, and the darker warped grid is the averages of those guesses. Before the study, they were fairly good at locating sounds, but after changing their pinna shape, they were downright terrible. Over a series of days and weeks with their new pinnas, the participants all adjusted and became better at locating sound.</p>

值得庆幸的是，在移除模具后，参与者可以毫无困难地恢复到原来的耳朵。耳廓形状对于虚拟现实中的沉浸式声音体验至关重要，以至于像Apple和Sony这样的公司实际上会扫描你的耳朵，以创建个性化的空间音频。长期以来，人们一直试图利用和放大我们定位声音的能力。1880年，Alfred Mayer教授展示了一种名为**拓音器**（Topophone: 一种早期用于定位声音的设备）的装置，用于在雾中定位船只。它由两个可调节的听筒组成。通过改变它们之间的距离和角度，水手们可以缩小船只雾笛的方向。不幸的是，它们并不是很有用，因为声波会与雾相互作用。

<p class="english-text">So it is something your brain can adapt to. Thankfully, after the molds were removed, participants had no trouble reverting back to their original ears. Pinna shape is so key to an immersive sound experience in virtual reality that companies like Apple and Sony actually scan your ears to create personalized spatial audio. And for a long time, people have been trying to harness and amplify our ability to locate sounds. In 1880, professor Alfred Mayer presented a device called a topophone to locate ships in the fog. It was made from two adjustable hearing cones. By changing the distance and angle between them, sailors could narrow down the direction of a ship's foghorn. Unfortunately, they weren't very useful because sound waves interact with fog.</p>

但在第一次世界大战期间，定位接近的轰炸机至关重要。因此，军队开发了名为**声镜**（Sound mirrors: 一种大型声学设备，用于放大和定位远距离声音）的特殊设备来放大声音。在英国，声镜站协同工作，可以提前15分钟定位敌人。但随着飞机速度的加快，声镜无法足够早地探测到它们，最终在**雷达**（Radar: 一种利用无线电波探测目标并测量其距离、方向和速度的系统）发明后被废弃。但即使这项技术过时了，其系统却没有。雷达团队使用了最初由声镜项目开发的协调站理念。联动的雷达站是不列颠之战中的关键防御力量。

<p class="english-text">But then during World War I locating bombing planes on approach was of central importance. So armies developed special equipment called sound mirrors to amplify sound. In Britain, sound mirror stations coordinated together to locate an enemy up to 15 minutes in advance. But as planes became faster, sound mirrors couldn't detect them early enough, and they were eventually abandoned after the invention of radar. But even though the technology became obsolete, the system was not. The radar team used the coordinating station's idea that was first developed from the Sound Mirror program. Linked radar stations were a critical defense in the Battle of Britain.</p>

### 双耳节拍：大脑内部的频率混合

这是悉尼市政厅管风琴上的Vox Angelica。当两根风管略微失调时，声音会产生这种脉动效应。如果我播放纯音，你可以更明显地听到这种效果。这是一个纯粹的261赫兹正弦波（发出蜂鸣声）。和一个纯粹的263赫兹正弦波（发出蜂鸣声）。当这两个音调同时播放时，那些压缩波和折射波会相互干扰。有时波峰对齐会产生更响亮的声音，而当波峰与波谷对齐时，它们会相互抵消。因为这些频率相隔两赫兹，你每秒会听到两次更响亮的脉冲。这被称为**拍频**（Beating: 两种频率相近的声音混合时产生的周期性音量变化）。

<details>

<p class="english-text">This is the Vox Angelica on the Sydney Town Hall Organ. When two pipes are slightly out of tune, there's this pulsing effect to the sound. You can hear that in a more pronounced way if I play pure tones. Here is a pure 261 hertz sine wave. (sound beeping) And a pure 263 hertz sine wave. (sound beeping) When both of these tones play, those compression and refraction waves interfere with each other. Sometimes the peaks line up to produce a louder sound, and when a peak lines up with a trough, they cancel out. Because these frequencies are separated by two hertz, you hear two louder pulses every second. This is known as beating.</p>
</details>

现在拍频非常清晰，当两个波在空气中相互干扰时，这很合理。但如果一个261赫兹的音调在左耳播放，一个263赫兹的音调在右耳播放，会发生什么呢（发出蜂鸣声）？你听到了什么？嗯，这些音调没有机会相互作用，但你仍然可以听到一些微妙的拍频。你的大脑以与相位差对应的速率放电，从而产生拍频感知。当你的大脑将这些频率混合在一起时，这被称为**双耳节拍**（Binaural Beats: 左右耳分别听到不同频率的声音时，大脑感知到的虚拟节拍）。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Now the beats are really clear, and this makes sense when the two waves are interfering in the air. But what happens if a 261 hertz tone is played in one ear and a 263 hertz tone is played in the other? (sound beeping) What did you hear? Well, the tones never had a chance to interact, but you can still hear some subtle beating. Your brain is firing at a rate corresponding to the phase difference causing the beat perception. When your brain mixes these frequencies together, it's called Binaural Beats.</p>
</details>

也许你已经听说过双耳节拍，因为在YouTube上快速搜索会发现有些人声称它们可以提高专注力或记忆力。但2023年的一项评论没有定论，并强调需要更标准化的测试方法。

### 结论：大脑在听觉中的核心作用

听觉错觉并不是我们听觉有缺陷的迹象。我的意思是，世界是一个混乱、嘈杂的地方，我们的大脑已经发展出复杂的方法来处理模糊性。你用过去的经验或期望来填补空白。如果没有你的大脑进行这些潜意识的调整，鸡尾酒会听起来就永远只是一团糟。听觉错觉向我们展示了我们的感知何时出错，但整个系统在获取真相方面做得相当好（发出嘶嘶声）。

<p class="english-text">Audio illusions aren't a sign that our sense of hearing is faulty. I mean, the world is a messy, noisy place, and our brains have developed complex methods to deal with ambiguity. You fill in the gaps with your past experiences or expectations. Without your brain making these subconscious adjustments, a cocktail party would always just sound like a total mess. Audio illusions show us where our perception goes wrong, but the system as a whole is pretty good at getting to the truth. (static hissing)</p>
