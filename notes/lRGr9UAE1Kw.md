### 投资组合构建的挑战与尾部风险

Tracy: 大家好，欢迎收听《OddLots》播客的又一期节目。我是Tracy Alloway。

<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to another episode of the OddLots podcast. I'm Tracy Aloway</p>
</details>

Joe: 我是Joe Weisenthal。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I'm Joe Weisenthal.</p>
</details>

Tracy: Joe，我一直在反思今年。这是忙碌的一年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Joe, I've been reflecting on this year. It's been a busy year. Yeah, go on.</p>
</details>

Joe: 事实上，我们正在录制这期节目，又一次出差。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In fact, we're recording this. We're on yet another trip.</p>
</details>

Tracy: 是啊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I know.</p>
</details>

Joe: 我们在亨廷顿海滩参加今年的“未来验证大会”（Future Proof Conference），这总是很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're in Huntington Beach for this year's Future Proof Conference, which is</p>
</details>

Tracy: 总是很开心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">always a fun time.</p>
</details>

Joe: 我一直很喜欢这个活动，但我们确实经常在路上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">An event I always enjoy, but we have been on the road a lot.</p>
</details>

Tracy: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have.</p>
</details>

Tracy: 我觉得这一整年对我来说都开始变得非常超现实。由于各种原因，它与往年感觉非常不同。但我也在想，其中一个原因是因为现在进行**投资组合构建**（Portfolio Construction: 根据投资目标和风险偏好，选择和配置不同资产的过程）似乎越来越难了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I feel like the entire year is starting to feel very surreal for me. It feels just very different to prior years for many different reasons. But I was also thinking one of those reasons is because it seems harder and harder to do portfolio construction nowadays.</p>
</details>

Tracy: 我知道这听起来很奇怪，因为市场仍处于历史高位，一切似乎都进展顺利，尽管我们最近公布了糟糕的就业数据。但如果我回想起今年我们看到的大幅下跌，那看起来真的很可怕，因为基本上所有资产都同时下跌了，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I know that sounds really weird given that like markets are still at record highs and everything seems to be going reasonably well even though we had that terrible jobs number. But if I think back to the big leg down that we saw this year, it seemed really scary because basically everything sold off at once, right?</p>
</details>

Joe: 你知道我真正喜欢什么吗？我喜欢你以这种哲学性的方式开始。就像我们出门在外，诸如此类。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know what I really like? I like how you started this with this philosophical thing. It's like we're out on the road and all this</p>
</details>

Tracy: 然后我就在想，我该如何保护我的投资组合？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then I was like, how do I protect my portfolio?</p>
</details>

Joe: 思考着，时代的超现实感，现在我们又回到了投资组合构建。但确实如此，有几件事正在发生。所以，一个是跨资产类别的变动。另一件事，与此非常相关，是它的另一面，即相关性崩溃。然后还有另一个因素在起作用，至少可以说。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and reflecting and the surality of the times and now we bring it around to portfolio construction but no there's true and there's two a couple things going on so one is the sort of like cross asset class moves the other thing is and it's very related to that I mean it's the flip side of this which is correlation breakdown and then there is still this other element that I think is at play where at least like</p>
</details>

Joe: 我会说还有两件事，一是美国资产内部，赢家仍然是赢家，尤其是许多大型科技股。所以你还没有看到那种结构性的变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would say there's two more things which is that one within US assets the winners are still the winners right especially a lot of these big tech names so you haven't gotten the sort secular</p>
</details>

Tracy: 人们已经谈论估值过高很久了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and people have been talking about overvaluations for ages,</p>
</details>

Joe: 永远。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">forever.</p>
</details>

Joe: 此外，你承担波动性风险所获得的报酬不多，或者说波动性指标仍然很低。所以有很多困难且反直觉的事情正在发生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the fact that, you know, you're not getting paid much to take on volatility risk or volatility measures are still very low. So there's a lot of difficult unintuitive things going on</p>
</details>

Tracy: 我甚至不知道**尾部风险对冲**（Tail Risk Hedge: 针对市场极端事件或小概率事件造成的巨大损失进行保护的策略）现在到底是什么样子，因为我本以为，嗯，也许你会分散投资到**长期债券**（Long-duration bonds: 剩余期限较长的债券，对利率变化敏感度高）之类的，但今年四月我们大跌时，长期债券表现也不佳。所以，这让我百思不得其解，如果此时此刻你担心事情会从字面和比喻意义上“爆炸”，你会怎么做？现在尾部风险对冲到底是什么样子？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I don't even know what a tail risk hedge actually looks like at this point because I would have thought like well obviously maybe you diversify into longduration bonds or something like that but then in April when we had the big sell-off long duration did not do that well either. So, it kind of has me scratching my head about if you were worried about stuff both literally and figuratively perhaps blowing up at this point in time. What would you be doing? Like what does a tail risk hedge actually look like nowadays?</p>
</details>

Joe: 你会买黄金吗？它已经创下历史新高了。所以，是的，这很令人困惑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You like buy gold? That's already a record high. So, yeah, it's confusing.</p>
</details>

Tracy: 是的。好的。所以，说到这里，我很高兴地说，我们请来了最完美的嘉宾，来谈论尾部风险保险，以及一般的尾部风险。他是一位在华尔街工作了很长时间，职业生涯非常辉煌的人。有很多故事涉及你我肯定会认识的大人物。我们将与Veneer Benali对话。他当然是LongTail Alpha的创始人，之前曾在许多许多公司工作过。我们稍后会深入探讨所有这些。Veneer，非常感谢您来到《Hot Thoughts》。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. Okay. So, on that note, I'm very happy to say we actually have the perfect guest to talk about tail risk insurance and just tail risks in general. someone who's been working on Wall Street for a really, really long time and has a very storied career. Lots of stories involving big names that you and I would definitely recognize. We're going to be speaking with Veneer Benali. He is of course the founder of a longtail alpha and again has worked at many, many firms previously. We'll get into all of that. Veneer, thank you so much for coming on Hot Thoughts.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 谢谢你们邀请我。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you for having me.</p>
</details>

Joe: 那么我应该直接请您大致总结一下您的职业生涯，因为它确实有点令人惊叹。但重要的是，您并非以交易员身份起步，而是以数学家身份起步的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I should just go ahead and ask you to give a sort of fiveinut summary of your career because it is kind of amazing. But the important thing is you didn't start out as a trader. You started out as a mathematician.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 是的。我最初是一名理论物理学家。1991年，我正在哈佛大学完成我的博士学位。当时经济衰退刚刚来袭。我不知道经济衰退是什么。我想成为一名教授。但我的工作机会泡汤了，因为我原本要去超导超级对撞机（Superconducting Super Collider）工作，但它在1990年代被国会取消了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yep. I started out as a theoretical physicist. I was finishing my PhD at Harvard and this is 1991. The recession had just hit. I didn't know what a recession was. I wanted to be a professor. But my job evaporated because I was going to go work at the super colliders the superconducting super collider that got cancelled by Congress 1990s.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 我在法国有一个博士后职位，还有一个我想是在德克萨斯州奥斯汀。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I had a postoc lined up in France and one I think it was in Texas in Austin</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 我接到了华尔街高盛（Goldman Sachs）的电话。他们正在寻找像我这样的**量化分析师**（Quants: 运用数学和统计模型分析金融市场并开发交易策略的专业人士）来从事**期权交易**（Options Trading: 买卖期权合约的行为，期权赋予持有人在未来特定时间以特定价格买卖标的资产的权利），或者更确切地说，是期权模型构建。所以我去面试了，主要是因为这是一次免费的纽约之行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I got a call out of Wall Street out of Goldman. They were looking for quants like me to work on options trading or options model building rather I should say. So I went and interviewed mostly because it was a free trip to New York.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 我去了那里，一位年长的绅士面试了我，他边做笔记边说：“不懂任何金融。”完全披露，我当时确实不懂金融，对此也没有兴趣。面试我的人是费雪·布莱克（Fisher Black）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I went there, got interviewed by an elderly gentleman who was taking notes saying doesn't know any finance. Full disclosure, I knew no finance. I had no interest in it. It was Fisher Black who was interviewing me.</p>
</details>

Joe: 哦，哇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh wow.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 我决定，你知道，**布莱克-斯科尔斯模型**（Black-Scholes model: 一种用于计算欧式期权理论价格的数学模型，由费雪·布莱克和迈伦·斯科尔斯等人提出）的声誉。我当时并不知道，当我拒绝了高盛的工作后，我在花旗银行（Citibank）接受了另一份**衍生品**（Derivatives: 价值来源于标的资产（如股票、债券、商品等）的金融合约）交易的工作，因为在我看来，那是一次休假。我打算做六个月到一年，然后回到物理学领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I decided, you know, Black Scholes fame. Little did I know when I turned that job down from Goldman, I took another job at City Bank trading derivatives cuz in my mind it was a sabbatical. I was going to do this for about 6 months to a year and then go back to physics.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 嗯。我当时并不知道，我的整个生活将与期权交易紧密相连。所以，这就是我一直在做的事情。我们稍后会更多地谈论尾部风险对冲。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Mh. Well, little did I know that my whole life would become basically very deeply connected with option trading. So, that's what I've been doing. And we'll talk a lot more about Taylor sketching in a second.</p>
</details>

Tracy: 等等，我得问一下，既然费雪·布莱克亲自面试了你，你为什么决定拒绝高盛，而选择当时去花旗银行呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wait, I got to ask why did you decide to turn down Goldman given that Fischer Black himself was doing the interview and you chose to go to City at that time?</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 嗯，高盛那份是研究工作，而花旗那份实际上是衍生品交易。由于交易离我所知的领域太远了，而且这对我来说本来就是大约一年的假期，所以听起来像是一件好事，或者说一件有趣的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, one was a research job at Goldman and the job at city was actually trading derivatives and uh since trading was so far away from what I knew and this was really supposed to be a vacation for me for about a year like sound like a good thing to do or fun thing to do rather.</p>
</details>

Joe: 你有没有觉得，我总是很好奇物理学家早期进入华尔街的故事，有没有一段时间你觉得它有点不值一提？我的意思是，你称之为一种度假工作。它在一段时间内是否让你觉得在智力上有所欠缺，然后它最终是否变得像你当初预期学术生涯那样，在智力上真正令人满意？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Did you ever feel like I'm always so curious about stories from the early days of physicists going to Wall Street was there a period where you felt like it was a bit bene I mean you call it kind of a vacation job. Did it feel intellectually beneath you for a while and then did it eventually become sort of genuinely intellectually satisfying in the way that maybe you had anticipated an academic career to become?</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 很有趣。所以，当时的建模方法确实显得有些过于简单。举个例子，我们做的第一笔大额交易，我当时是银行家，那是一笔与美元/日元挂钩的日元利率上限期权。所以它基本上是一个双因子期权，被称为混合期权。结果发现，作为一名物理学家，这对我来说非常容易。我能够非常轻松地编写一个**蒙特卡洛模拟**（Monte Carlo: 一种通过随机抽样来估计数值结果的计算方法），来编写这个敲出式上限期权。但对于金融界的人来说，这有点难。所以数学部分非常简单。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So interesting. So the modeling certainly at those days seemed a little too naive. So for instance, I'll give you an example. Very first trade that we did large trade I was bank at the time and it was an interest rate cap on yen interest rates linked to the dollar yen. So it was basically a two-factor option called a hybrid option. And it turned out that as a physicist I was very easy. It was very easy for me and I was very able to write a Monte Carlo to write this knockout cap. But for the finance people it was kind of tough. So the math was very easy.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 但我也了解到，交易不仅仅是数学。交易涉及很多行为学的东西，诸如此类。这些我显然都必须学习。我有一些很棒的故事，关于我在1990-94年间做得非常糟糕的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I also learned that trading is not just math. Trading is a lot of behavioral stuff and so on. And that I just obviously had to learn. And I have some great stories of stuff that I did really badly back in 199094.</p>
</details>

Joe: 告诉我们你做得很糟糕的一个故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tell us the story about something you did badly.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 嗯，回到1994年，如果你还记得，1993年美联储放松了政策，利率相当低，每个人都在做多收益率曲线的前端，并购买欧元美元期货合约。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, to 1994, if you remember, you know, 1993, the Fed had eased and rates were quite low and everybody was long the front end of the yield curve and buying EUR dollar futures contracts.</p>
</details>

Joe: 等等，附近不是有个城镇破产了吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wait, didn't a town around here go bankrupt?</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 是的。是的。是的。我们稍后会谈到那个。没错。所以，1994年2月，美联储加息了25个基点。然后非常令人惊讶的是，同年4月18日，他们又进行了一次会议期间的加息，当时债券市场大幅下跌。我只是做了人类会做的事情，那就是押注**均值回归**（Mean Reversion: 资产价格或收益率倾向于回归到其长期平均水平的现象）。所以我试图买入债券市场，一次又一次地买入，直到我意识到有一种东西叫做**趋势跟踪**（Trend Following: 识别并跟随市场价格趋势进行交易的策略）和止损。我想债券市场下跌了整整15到20个点，最终我全部收复了，但那真是残酷的几个月，我简直是赔得一塌糊涂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. Yes. Yes. We'll get to that. Exactly. So, February of 1994, the Fed raised rates by 25. And then very surprisingly April 18th of that year they did an intermeating increase and at that time bond market really sold off quite a bit and I just did what human beings do which is bet on mean reversion. And so I tried to buy the bond market and tried to buy the bond market again and again and again until I realized that there's something called trend following and exit and I think the bond market sold off a good 15 20 points and finally I recouped it all but it was a brutal few months of literally getting my face ripped off.</p>
</details>

Joe: 还有一件事我很好奇，关于量化分析师的早期，当时这些大银行或大型交易公司在招聘科学家，无论是数学家还是物理学家时，他们到底会给出怎样的招聘说辞？因为，你知道，量化分析师在当时还处于早期阶段，尽管我们已经经历了1987年。所以我真的很好奇他们当时告诉你会做什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So one other thing I'm curious about the sort of early days of quants but what exactly was the pitch to scientists whether they're you know mathematicians or physics guys when these big banks or big trading firms are trying to recruit back then because you know like quant was in the I know we had 1987 by then but it was still relatively in the early days so I'm really curious like what they told you about what you would be doing.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 所以从建模方面来说，这相当直接，对吧？布莱克-斯科尔斯方程和随机微积分，随机金融，基本上就是物理学中的热方程或扩散方程，这是每个物理学家在研究生早期都会学到的东西。这就像求解偏微分方程。所以数学是完全相同的，金融数学。也许这实际上是一个问题，现在回想起来，我已经做了30多年，30多年了，并且幸存下来，也许这是一个问题，因为这种美感可能会某种程度上掩盖其底层的摩擦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So in the from the modeling side it's pretty straightforward right the black shields equation and stochastic calculus stoastic finance is basically what's called the heat equation or the diffusion equation in physics and that's something that every physicist learns when they're in early graduate school. It's like solving a partial differential equation. So the math is exactly identical the math of finance. And maybe that's a problem actually in in retrospect now that having done this for 30 years and 30 plus years and survived maybe that's a problem because the beauty can somehow hide the frictions that are underneath it.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 从交易方面来说，当我刚开始交易时，我认为这非常简单，就是数学上敏锐和快速，并且能够回答问题，这让面试官觉得他们正在招募到聪明的人才，可以在交易台上进行培训，对吧？可以说是一张白纸。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">From the trading side when I first started trading I think it was very simply being mathematically sharp and quick uh and being able to answer quizzes just made interviewers feel like they were getting smart people on the desk that they could train, right? The blank canvas so to speak.</p>
</details>

### 量化交易的兴起与市场反馈循环

Joe: 是的。那么一旦交易台的人员配备了拥有博士学位的物理学家，并且他们理解像**布朗运动**（Brownian Motion: 粒子在流体中做无规则运动的现象，在金融中常用于模拟资产价格的随机波动）这样的东西，这是否改变了实际市场的交易方式，从你的角度来看？比如，在这之前和之后，资产是否更符合模型的预期，因为模型对它们产生了影响？你对物理学革命前后实际市场行为的观察是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So once people on these desks got armed with PhD physicists and understanding of like Brownian motion and stuff like that, did that change how the actual markets traded from your perspective? Like sort of pre and post that did assets conform more to as models anticipated because of the model effect on them like what was your observation of actual existing market behavior pre and post the physics revolution?</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 哦，绝对如此。这是一个非常重要的问题，因为如果你快进到2018年，**波动率末日**（Volmageddon: 指2018年2月，VIX短期期货合约突然暴跌，导致大量做空VIX的交易策略和产品遭受巨大损失的市场事件）的大崩溃，以及现在发生的许多事情，实际上我们现在所做的，我现在所做的，都与模型和市场之间存在非常紧密的**反馈循环**（Feedback Loop: 系统中一个环节的输出又作为输入返回到同一环节，形成循环影响）这一事实有关。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, absolutely. And this is a very important question because if you fast forward to 2018, the big XIV debacle and the Volmageddon and a lot of things that happen now and actually fundamentally what we do now, what I do now is related to this fact that there's a very tight feedback loop between models and markets and models.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 举一个非常简单的例子，对吧？如果你卖给别人一个期权，你必须管理风险，当然，当你卖出期权时，你会获得波动率溢价。这就是你卖出它的原因。可以说，你获得了一笔保险费。但为了管理头寸，你必须进行**德尔塔对冲**（Delta Hedging: 通过调整标的资产的头寸来抵消期权德尔塔风险的策略）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So give you a very simple example, right? If you have an option that you've sold to somebody and you have to manage the risk, of course, when you sell the option, you're getting a volatility premium. That's why you sell it. You're getting an insurance premium, so to speak. But then to manage the position you have to delta hedge.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 但德尔塔对冲意味着你必须买卖标的资产，以及一些更高阶的**希腊字母**（Greeks: 期权定价模型中的敏感性指标，如**伽马**（Gamma: 德尔塔变化率）、**维加**（Vega: 波动率变化率）和**西塔**（Theta: 时间衰减率）），这些你都读过。但德尔塔对冲要求人们能够买卖，这样他们才能成为卖方。做市商当然是局部持平的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But delta hedging means that you have to buy and sell the underlying asset and some higher order Greeks as well. Gamma, Vega, theta that you've all read about. But delta hedging requires people to be able to buy and sell so that they are the seller. The market maker is locally flat of course.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 所以，做市商，这就是你所做的，这就是你赚取收入的方式。问题在于，在数学或数学金融中存在一种理想化，认为你可以无限量地进行这种操作，而且规模无关紧要，但事实并非如此。流动性实际上并不存在。布莱克-斯科尔斯模型的基本假设是你可以以几乎为零的交易成本进行连续交易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the market maker that's what you do and that's how you earn your keep earn your fees so to speak. The problem is that there's an idealization in mathematics or mathematical finance that you can do this at an unlimited size and size doesn't matter but it matters. Liquidity is actually not there. The basic assumption of black shores is that you can continuously trade with almost zero transactions costs.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 嗯，这在实际市场中根本不真实。事实上，即使在过去两年，你也会看到**E-迷你股指期货合约**（E-mini Futures Contracts: 芝加哥商业交易所交易的标准化、电子化的股指期货合约，通常以标准合约的五分之一规模交易）的流动性下降，这些合约可能是股票市场零阶对冲工具，其流动性相对于高位经常下降到原来的1/20或1/50。所以人们根本无法退出。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, that's just not true in real markets. As a matter of fact, in the last maybe two years even, you've seen liquidity in the E- mini futures contracts, which are possibly the I would say the zeroth order hedging instrument for the equity markets go down relative to the high levels frequently go down to maybe 120th or 150th of it level. So people just can't get out.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 所以发生的情况是，人们卖出期权，然后开始德尔塔对冲。德尔塔对冲导致期权市场对德尔塔做出反应，然后导致新的对冲进入。所以这个反馈循环变得越来越紧密，直到某些东西崩溃。当某些东西崩溃，并且机器人关闭时，这就是今天的环境。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what happens is that people sell options then they start delta hedging. Delta hedging results in the options market reacting to the delta then results in new hedges coming in. So this feedback loop gets tighter and tighter and tighter until something breaks. And when something breaks and the bot shut down, which is today's environment,</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 你实际上没有流动性。那时你就会看到像4月2日“解放日”（Liberation Day）那样的崩盘。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you actually have no liquidity. And that's when you get these crashes like Liberation Day on April 2nd.</p>
</details>

Tracy: 波动率末日（Volmageddon）绝对是市场中比较奇怪的事件之一，因为当**VIX波动率曲线**（VIX Curve: 反映不同到期日VIX期货合约价格的曲线，用于衡量市场对未来波动性的预期）实际倒挂时，每个人都能看到将会发生什么。就像你可以看到所有这些产品都将彻底崩溃，但似乎没有人对此做出反应，直到为时已晚。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Volageddon was definitely one of the more weirder events in markets because everyone could see what was going to happen when the VIX curve actually inverted. like you could see that all these products were going to go absolutely belly up and no one no one seemed to react to it until it was like much too late.</p>

### 波动率出售的演变与市场流动性危机

Tracy: 这让我想起来。所以，我们之所以在亨廷顿海滩采访您，其中一个原因是因为您曾在**太平洋投资管理公司**（Pimco: 全球最大的固定收益投资管理公司之一）与**比尔·格罗斯**（Bill Gross: 著名债券基金经理，Pimco的联合创始人）共事。我们上次与比尔·格罗斯对话，我想实际上也是两年前在亨廷顿海滩。我们当时与他讨论的一个话题就是**波动率出售**（Volatility Selling: 通过卖出期权来赚取波动率溢价的策略，预期市场波动性将低于期权定价所隐含的波动性）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That reminds me. So, one of the reasons that we are interviewing you here in Huntington Beach is because you used to work at Pimco with Bill Gross. And the last time we spoke to Bill Gross, I think was actually at Huntington Beach two years ago. And one of the things we spoke to him about was volatility selling.</p>
</details>

Tracy: 比尔在债券市场中，在2015年左右，也就是2010年代中期，一度成为了波动率出售的代表人物。我真的很好奇，现在谁在出售波动率，以及在您的职业生涯中，这种情况发生了怎样的变化？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And Bill kind of became the poster child for a little bit of volatility selling at least in the bond market in the sort of like guess it would have been 2015 around then, mid sort of 2010s area. I'm really curious who's selling V now and how has it changed over the course of your career?</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 是的，这是一个很棒的旁注。比尔和我一直是好朋友，事实上，我之所以去Pimco，是因为我在2000年听比尔在一次宣传他的书的演讲中发言。比尔是一位了不起的天才，一位伟大的投资者。我最近收到的最好的赞美之一，是我和他交流时，他说：“你的论文在我的阅读清单首位。”我问：“哪篇论文，比尔？”他说的是我与拉里·哈里斯（Larry Harris）合写的关于波动率出售生态系统的论文，这个生态系统基本上在2018年之前发展起来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, so great uh little side point there. So Bill and I've been great friends as a matter of fact I went to Pimco because I heard Bill speak at a talk when he was advertising in book back in 2000 and Bill's an amazing genius, great investor. And one of the best compliments I got recently, I was communicating with him and he said, "I have your paper at the top of my reading list." And I said, "Which paper, Bill?" and he said this paper that I wrote with Larry Harris on the volatility selling ecosystem that basically you grew up before 2018.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 所以是的，比尔在某种意义上开创了在固定收益领域出售波动率的整个理念，特别是通过购买抵押贷款或明确出售**跨式期权**（Straddles: 同时买入或卖出相同行权价和到期日的看涨和看跌期权）和**勒式期权**（Strangles: 同时买入或卖出不同行权价但相同到期日的看看涨和看跌期权）。我们意识到，而且我当时是Pimco的分析主管。在我在那里的15年左右时间里，我得以看到并帮助他管理这些投资组合的量化风险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So yes, so Bill actually in in a sense invented this whole idea of selling volatility in fixed income especially through buying mortgages or explicit selling of straddles and strangles. And what we realized and again I was head of analytics at Pimco. over the last over 15 years or so I was there I got to see and help him manage the quantitative risks of those portfolios.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 我们最终向当时的许多客户普及了波动率出售、收取波动率溢价等知识，这确实为Pimco的投资组合增加了相当多的，比尔称之为**结构性阿尔法**（Structural Alpha: 通过系统性地利用市场结构或行为偏差而获得的超额收益），每年20、30、40个基点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We ended up educating a lot of our clients at that time about volatility selling harvesting vault premiums and so on which did end up adding quite a bit of as Bill calls it structural alpha to the PIMCO portfolios and you know 20 30 40 basis points every year.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 后来发生的是，每个人都受到了教育，这成为了学术常识的一部分，每个人都意识到了。市场变得非常拥挤，这有点像出售保险，对吧？所以当你发现一种保险策略有效时，你就会说，为什么不成为一个多险种的保险提供商呢？于是你开始出售各种保险策略。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What happened is that everybody got educated and it became part of the academic lore and everybody realized it. There was a lot of crowding and it's a little bit like selling insurance right so when you find that one insurance policy selling works then you say why don't become multi-line insurance provider so you start selling insurance policy on everything and so what has happened now over my career it have gone from institutional selling where first it was hedge funds then it was large sophisticated mutual funds like pimco who could actually still fit it inside of the mutual fund complex because selling naked options is not really allowed unless you cash back it,</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right?</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 然后随着时间的推移，现在已经发展到所有自己动手（DIY）的投资者。所以所有的财富管理办公室、家族办公室和大型捐赠基金，以及现在被称为**另类风险溢价**（Alternative Risk Premiums: 传统风险溢价（如股票风险溢价）之外，通过特定策略（如波动率出售、趋势跟踪）获得的收益）的整个领域，都是基于这个理念。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then over time it has now gone to all the do-it-yourselfers. So all the wealth offices and family offices and large endowments and this whole area what's uh which is now called alternative risk premiums is based on this idea</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 你可以通过各种形式，无论是显性还是隐性的，出售波动率来产生收入。所以每个人都在这样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that you can go and sell volatility in various forms explicit forms or implicit forms to generate income. So everybody's doing it.</p>
</details>

Joe: 是的，这就是答案。越来越多的人都在做。所以当我们看到另类风险溢价时，它基本上就是波动率出售的叠加，是这样吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, that's the answer. everyone even more people are doing. So when we see alternative risk premia it's basically a wall selling overlay is that it</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 是的，我的意思是你可以让它更复杂或更简单。我的意思是，仅仅说是波动率出售有点天真，但波动率出售是其中一个非常重要的组成部分。AQR资本管理公司（AQR Capital Management）的一些人写了一些很棒的论文，他们研究了所有资产类别，如股票、债券、信用、外汇，然后还将其细分为各种策略风格、质量和动量等。他们构建了一个16x6的矩阵，然后重新创建了这种我认为听起来更复杂的波动率出售。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah I mean you can make it more or less sophisticated I mean it's a little bit naive to say it's only wall selling but wall selling is a very important component of it and there were some great papers by people from AQR who took every asset class so equities bonds credit foreign exchange and then also sliced it down in various types of strategy style and quality and momentum and so on they made like a 16x6 matrix and then they recreated did this what I consider to be more sophisticated sounding</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 但它确实是波动率出售，人们所做的，为了非常清楚地说明，它不仅仅是波动率出售，他们还在其上叠加了其他东西，比如**趋势跟踪**（Trend Following: 识别并跟随市场价格趋势进行交易的策略）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ball selling but it really is false selling and what people do just to to be very clear is it's not just ball selling they also layer on other things like trend following on top of it</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 以创造对波动率出售的制衡，因为趋势跟踪本质上是一种喜欢波动率或做多波动率的策略。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">to create a counterbalance to the ball selling because trend following is naturally a ball liking or ball long ball type of strategy</p>
</details>

Joe: 回到我之前没有意识到的E-迷你期货流动性下降或崩溃的问题，市场中是否存在某种，我不知道这是否是热力学定律或类似的类比，即当某种工具成为首选的对冲工具时，它越受欢迎，该工具的流动性容量就越小。这就是现在正在发生的事情吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">going back to I hadn't realized that about the declining or the collapsing liquidity within the e- mini futures but is there some sort of I don't know law of thermodynamics or something I don't know if that's the term or that's the analogy in markets where such that when some instrument becomes the hedging instrument of choice, the more popular that gets, the less capacity there is for liquidity in that instrument. Is that sort of what's going on here?</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 是的。所以，在这种情况下，E-迷你期货合约基本上是一种投机工具。它们是一种现金等价物工具。所以它们服务于许多不同的目的。但我认为这里正在发生的最大事情是。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, in this case, the e- mini futures contract are basically a speculation vehicle. They're a cash equization vehicle. So, they serve a lot of different purposes. But I think the biggest thing that's going on here</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 大约从十年前开始，并且有些隐蔽地，市场从人类**做市商**（Market Makers: 在金融市场中持续提供买卖报价，为市场提供流动性的机构或个人）转变为机器人做市商。所以，当我开始交易时，是人类做市商。我仍然记得在1990年代，芝加哥期货交易所（CBOT）交易大厅里的汤米·鲍德温（Tommy Baldwin），你知道，你做一笔交易，汤米·鲍德温，他是个传奇人物。显然，他会举起手，市场就会停止，转向，然后朝另一个方向走。人类可以做到这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">is that starting maybe about 10 years ago and somewhat surreptitiously, the market morphed from human market makers. So, when I started trading, it was human market makers. I still remember when I was, you know, in the 1990s, Tommy Baldwin on the pit of the CBOT floor, Chicago border trade floor, you know, you would do a trade and Tommy Baldwin and he was legendary. Obviously, he would lift his hand up and the market would stop and turn and go the other way. Human humans could do that.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 是的，在过去15年或10年里，奇怪的是，人类似乎离开了这个做市领域，90%以上的工作都是由机器人完成的。机器人非常清楚，自我生存对它们来说极其重要，一旦它们看到流动性海啸来袭，它们就会立刻避开，流动性变得非常间歇性。穆罕默德·埃尔-埃里安（Mohamed El-Erian）曾称之为**潜在流动性不足**（Latent Illiquidity: 市场在正常情况下看起来有流动性，但在压力或需要时流动性会迅速消失的现象），这正是当今市场的特征。它看起来有流动性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, what has happened surficially or you know very strangely over the last 15 or 10 years maybe is that the human beings have sort of left this market making area and 90 plus% is being made by bots and what bots know very well self-s survival is extremely important to them is as soon as they see a liquidity title wave coming tsunami coming at them they just get out of the way the liquidity just becomes very episodic and Muhammad Alaran used to call it latent illquidity which is just the fixture of the markets today. It looks liquid</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 而当你不需要它时，它就在那里，但当你需要它时，它却不在那里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and when you don't need it, it's there but if you need it, it's not there.</p>
</details>

Joe: 那么作为一名交易员，你如何应对这种情况呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So how do you actually deal with that as a trader?</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 是的。作为一名交易员，这又回到了期权的基本作用，对吧？那么期权有什么作用呢？我的意思是，在量化金融的世界里，你可以通过德尔塔对冲等方式复制一个期权。基本上是观察期权定价方程的偏导数，或者你可以说我直接买入期权。所以期权是你和期权提供者之间的**合同协议**（Contractual Agreement: 双方之间具有法律约束力的约定）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So as a trader, so this comes back to the role of options fundamentally, right? So what do options I mean in the world of quantitative finance, you can take an option, you can replicate it by doing delta hedging and so on. Basically looking at the partial derivatives of an option pricing equation or you can say I'll just buy the option. So an option is a contractual agreement between you and the option provider.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 所以如果存在流动性不足，并且你认为这是我们所处环境的一个固定特征，那么除了与某人签订合同协议之外，别无他法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if there's ill liquidity and you believe this is a fixture of the environment that we're going to live in, then there is no other way than to actually have a contractual agreement with somebody</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 你将流动性不足的风险委托给他们，所以你在溢价更便宜时买入。但试图自己进行德尔塔对冲，就像是试图让大象穿过针眼。人们根本无法做到。我的意思是，我就是无法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">where you're delegating the uh illquidity risk to them and so you are buying it when the premium is cheaper. But trying to delta hedge it yourself is like literally trying to you know put an elephant through the eye of a needle. There's just people just cannot work out. I mean, I just can't</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 我简直无法想象如今市场集体试图穿过那个针眼。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I just can't imagine the market collectively trying to get through that needle these days.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 根本没有。我们来谈谈四月，也许是4月2日到4月9日这段时间，因为那肯定是一次市场事件，也是一次真实的经济事件，发生了许多不仅仅是图表上的线条的事情。我们知道当时发生了什么，关税，然后一些关税的撤销等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There is just nothing there. Let's talk about April for a second and maybe that period like between April 2nd and April 9th because that was a a market event for sure and it was also a real economic event with many things going on that weren't just lines on a chart etc. and we know what sort of happened there with the tariffs and then the reversal of some of the tariffs and what so forth.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 从那时起，我们看到了一些相关性崩溃，我们以前的一些嘉宾也谈到过。从您的角度来看，无论是4月2日到4月9日，还是4月2日到现在，当时发生了什么，以至于也许这是一种新的**机制转换**（Regime Shift: 市场或经济环境发生根本性、结构性变化，导致旧有规律不再适用的情况）？那个月发生了什么变化？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Since then, we've seen some of these correlation breakdowns that some of our previous guests have talked about. From your perspective, you know, whether it's April 2nd through April 9th or April 2nd through now, what happened then such that maybe some maybe is it a new regime? What changed in that month? Yeah</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 我认为正在发生的事情之一是，我们正在缓慢经历一场机制转换，我喜欢总是描绘这样一幅画面，在我给你们描绘完这个宏观图景之后，我马上回答你的问题。从60年代到80年代，从60年代到80年代中期，你经历了通货膨胀上升、波动性上升、央行不可信的时期，事情有点失控，人们落后于曲线。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">though I think one of the things that is going on is we are slowly undergoing a regime shift and I like to always paint this picture and I'll come to your question right after I give you this big macro picture from the 60s to the 80s 60s to the mid 80s you had this period of rising inflation rising volatility noncredible central banks and stuff was kind of breaking and people were behind the curve.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 然后从1980年代开始，沃尔克（Volcker）提高了利率，直到大约2020年代末，2020年，新冠疫情是一个加速因素，你看到了负收益率和波动性下降，央行变得可信等等。我认为我们实际上又转了一个弯，所以从2020-21年开始，我认为我们可能会更像60年代到80年代，而不是1987年到2020年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">then you had the bulker increase of interest rates starting in the 1980s and until the maybe late 20s 2020 call it 2021 on covid was an accelerant you got negative yields and falling volatility credible central banks and so on and I think we've actually turned the corner again so starting in 202021 I think we are probably going to look more like the 60s to 80 than 1987 to 2020.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 现在有了这个背景，我认为问题确实回到了，是的，存在一种机制转换，无论是人们的反应函数还是事情发生的速度。所以我可以转述的一个数据点是，自从我开始交易以来，在过去，当危机发生时，即使包括我经历过的**全球金融危机**（GFC: Global Financial Crisis，指2008年爆发的全球性金融危机），而且我做得相当不错，事情通常需要几个月甚至几周才能纠正，你有时间计划和执行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now having put that backdrop you know in in front of us I think the issue really comes back to yes there is a regime shift both in terms of people's response function and how quickly things happen. So one data point that I can relay is since I started trading is in the past when crisis were would happen even including the GFC which I lived through and you know did fairly well it used to take months maybe weeks for things to correct and you had time to plan and time to execute.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 然后波动率末日（Volmageddon）可能只用了几天。2020年新冠疫情，可能只用了几天到几小时。然后从今年开始，感觉事情实际上是以小时甚至分钟为单位发生的。例如，在四月份，当大崩盘和调整发生时，所有的行动，包括我们的一些交易，都发生在盘前。所以市场甚至还没有开盘，如果你需要做些什么，你必须在夜间交易时段进行，因为所有的行动都在那里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then Volmageddon maybe took a few days. 2020 COVID it maybe happened in you know few days to few hours and then starting this year it feels like things are actually happening on an hourly to maybe minute basis. For instance in April when the you know big crash happened and the correction happened all the action including some of our trading happened in the pre- pre pre-market. So the markets had not even opened up and if you needed to do something you had to do it during the night session because that's where all the action was.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 所以我认为这是目前正在发生的一个特点，事情发生得更快，而且感觉天平倾向于更多的自动化交易，而不是人类驱动的交易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think that's one fixture what's going on right now is that stuff is happening much faster and it does feel like the balance is tilted in the favor of more automated trading rather than human-driven trading.</p>
</details>

Joe: 让我问一个关于尾部风险预测的哲学问题，那就是每当发生一次大崩溃时，我们突然就会听到各种关于尾部风险基金的故事，它们在上个月的混乱中表现出色，或者其他什么。然后接下来的三年里，就没有人再谈论它们了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let me ask a philosophical question about tail risk projection, which is whenever there's a blow up, we suddenly get all these stories about tail risk funds that have done phenomenally well out of last month's chaos or whatever it might be. And then no one talks about them for like the next three years.</p>
</details>

Tracy: 你不知道它们在其他月份是如何让你流血的，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You don't know how they're bleeding you dry during those other months, right?</p>
</details>

Joe: 没错。直到我们再次遭遇大崩溃，然后这个循环重复。在您看来，尾部风险保护的目的是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's right. Um until we get another blow up and then the cycle repeats itself. In your mind, what is the purpose of tail risk protection? Yeah,</p>
</details>

### 尾部风险对冲的本质与价值

Veneer Benali: 这非常简单，我一直在努力做这件事。这实际上是我创办公司以来的使命之一，不仅是管理风险，还要努力教育人们其目的何在。其目的与保险非常相似，并非每个人都需要它。如果你不住在加利福尼亚的地震多发区，或者佛罗里达的飓风多发区，你就不需要这种保险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">this is very simple and I've been trying to do this. This is actually one of my mission since I started our firm is not just managing the risk but also trying to educate people on what the purpose is. The purpose is very similar to insurance and not everybody needs it. If you don't live in California earthquake prone zone or in Florida hurricane prone zone, you don't need the insurance.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 但如果你要管理一个大型的股票重仓投资组合，顺便说一句，股票在过去100年里已经证明，而且可能在未来也是创造长期财富的唯一途径，因为人们会去工作。我在花旗银行时从我的老板那里学到的第一件事就是，看看GDP的对数与标普500指数的对数。图表是吻合的。基本上，如果人们工作，市场就会上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But if you're going to run a large equityheavy portfolio, and by the way, equities have demonstrated over the last 100 years and maybe going forward are the one way to create long-term wealth because people go to work. The first thing I learned when I was at City Bank from my boss told me was just look at log GDP versus log S&P. The charts are aligned. Basically, if people work, the market goes up.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 所以，这意味着你需要投资股票市场。你投资股票市场越多，你长期获得更高复合回报的可能性就越大。但同时，你也会遭受巨大的回撤。人们行为功能最大的问题之一是，当市场崩溃时，他们会忘记自己的计划，然后清仓。对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, what that means is that you need to be invested in the stock market. And the more you invest in the stock market, the more likely it is that you're going to make higher compounded returns over time. But also, you will suffer big draw downs. And one of the biggest problems with people's behavioral function is that when the markets collapse, they forget their plans and they liquidate. Right?</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 所以尾部风险从根本上来说，它不是一个你应该孤立地看待并说“这个基金表现好不好？”的基金。就像你不会回家说：“嗯，我的房屋保险保单的总回报是多少？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what tail risk fundamentally does, it's not a fund that you should look in isolation and say, is this fund a good performer or not? Just like you would not go back home and say, "Well, what the what was the total return on my home insurance policy?"</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 对吧？它只是每年正负100%。所以，你会停止购买保险吗？你不会，因为房屋保险或汽车保险不是一项投资。它是做生意的成本。所以，这就是人们应该思考尾部风险对冲的背景：它首先让你在糟糕事件中保护自己免受自身影响，其次，当市场下跌时。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right? It's just a positive negative 100%. Right? Every single year. So, would you quit buying insurance? You won't because home insurance or car insurance is not an investment. It is the cost of doing business. So that's the context in which one should think about tail risk hedging is it allows you to first protect yourself from yourself in the bad events and then secondly when the markets are down</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 这些对冲的价值上升，让你能够廉价购买资产，从而实现复合增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the value of those hedges going up allows you to buy assets on the sheep which results in compounded growth.</p>
</details>

Joe: 华尔街为什么没有创造一种工具，让你能够自动出售你的流动性来保护自己免受自身影响？我将投资这个基金，直到60年才能出售。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why hasn't Wall Street created an instrument where you could sell away your liquidity to protect you from yourself automatically? I'm going to invest in this fund and I cannot sell until the year60.</p>
</details>

Tracy: 那不就是所谓的锁定期吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Isn't that called lockups?</p>
</details>

Joe: 但那些基金真的存在吗？我能买到吗？然后有两件事直观上看起来是：A，你保护自己免受自身影响。B，你通过跨越时间自动实现多元化。然后C，这大概会更稳定，用于证券借贷并收取少量费用。华尔街是否创造了一种人们无法退出的基金？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But do those funds actually exist? Could I buy that? And then there's two things that intuitively seem that A you protect yourself from yourself. B, you diversify automatically by the fact that you're across time and then C presumably that would be more stable for securities lending and collect the little instrument. Has Wall Street created a fund that one can't get out of?</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 我想就像Tracy刚才提到的，对冲基金喜欢有锁定期，而且。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think like Tracy just mentioned uh hedge funds like to have lockups and and this</p>
</details>

Joe: 我应该能够购买一种我无法出售的**ETF**（ETF: Exchange Traded Fund，交易型开放式指数基金，一种在交易所上市交易的基金份额）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I just I should just be able to buy an ETF that I can't sell.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 是的。我想，如果你能通过监管机构的批准，我认为我们生活在一个ETF需要每日市值计价（Mark-to-market daily NAV）和完全透明的世界。但我确实认为，我认识的一位非常老练的机构投资者，也是我们的客户，他曾说，如果你能卖给我一个锁定期更长的产品，我愿意支付更多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Uh I think the if you can get over the regulators I think that we are living in a world where Marktomarket daily NAV etc for ETFs and full transparency is required. But I do think I mean one one very sophisticated institutional investor who was a client of ours actually said I would pay you more if you sold me a product that actually had a longer lock.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 因为这是我关于投资组合和一般多元化的问题，它回到了你提出的观点，即股票表现非常好，而且预期只要经济增长，股票就会继续表现良好一段时间。**60/40投资组合**（60/40 Portfolio: 一种传统的投资组合配置策略，将60%的资金投资于股票，40%投资于债券）曾经风靡一时，这是一个很好的投资组合，你的国债和股票相互平衡。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because this is a question I have about portfolios and diversification in general and it goes back to the point that you made about how stocks have done very well and the expectation is that as long as the economy grows stocks will continue to do well for a while 6040 was a craze right and this was a good portfolio of your treasuries and your stocks balance out.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 但撇开人们在低点抛售的行为因素不谈，多元化的理由是什么？当有一种资产类别长期表现如此出色时，多元化的理由是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but why should like what is the case for diversification let's say setting aside the behavioral fact that people sell at the lows What is the case for diversification when there is this asset class that does so well over time?</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 是的，这很棒。所以如果你能保证这种资产类别会一直增长，那么你就会100%只投资股票。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, so this is great. So if you could guarantee that this asset class would keep growing always then you would 100% be on stock only.</p>

Veneer Benali: 传统上，债券的作用是为你提供收入，当股票市场表现不佳时，至少你不会完全破产，因为你会有一些收益。

<p class="english-text">Now what bonds traditionally used to do was they provided you with income that when the stock market wasn't doing well at least you wouldn't go completely broke because you would have some yield.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 但我认为它走到了极端，对吧？我的意思是，最大的例子，我写了一整本书来讨论这个话题，就是欧洲中央银行效仿日本中央银行，然后他们开始以负收益率购买，并说服所有指数基金继续与他们一起购买债券。对吧？我的意思是，想想看。你当时在购买债券，这意味着你在借钱给别人，而且你在向他们支付利息。

<details>

<p class="english-text">But I think it got taken to an extreme right. I mean the greatest example and I wrote a whole book on this topic is is the European Central Bank followed the Japanese central bank and then they started buying at negative yields and they convinced all the indexers to keep buying bonds with them. Right? I mean think about this. You were buying bonds meaning you were lending somebody money and you were paying them interest</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 在那个时候，多元化是一种侮辱。我的意思是，你不会想和股票一起购买负收益率的债券，因为它对你没有任何帮助。我们今天正在承受其后果，因为债券市场在过去五年、七年甚至十年里，回报率绝对惨淡，为零。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and at that point diversification is an insult. I mean you don't want to buy a negatively yielding bond along with stocks because it does nothing for you. And we're living the consequences of it today because the bond market over the last five or seven or 10 years even has had absolutely dismal zero returns.</p>

<p class="english-text">I still think that I still don't think anyone is entitled to yield.</p>
</details>

Joe: 不，我不认为。如果你想承担风险，那就去争取。但是那种道德上的要求，政府必须为你提供收益，为了什么？为了不消费，不作为。饶了我吧。Joe，Joe花了一整年时间嘲笑你所谓的“收益虫”（yield bugs）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, I don't. If you want to take the risk, go get it. But the sort of moral demands that the government must provide you yield for what? For not spending and doing anything. Give me a break. Joe Joe spent a good year making fun of yield bugs as you call them.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 我不认为。这很棒。去吧，去获取你的收益。我为你感到高兴，但不要假装政府不提供无风险收益是一种道德侮辱。这只是我的唯一，这只是我的唯一观点。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I don't It's great. Go out, collect your yield. I'm I'm happy for you, but don't pretend that it's some sort of moral insult that the government isn't providing you risk-free yield. That is my only That is my only stamp.</p>
</details>

Joe: 我会认为那是美国政府最重要的角色。无论如何，我们回到刚才的话题。所以，这不仅仅是保险的概念。你提到了这一点，但它也是这样一种想法，即当市场崩溃时，你可以获得巨大的意外之财，然后你可以利用这笔钱在市场便宜而其他人现金短缺、无法做同样事情的时候大肆购买。你如何将这种做法付诸实践，以及如何根据你可能购买的资产类型来衡量预期的意外之财？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's I would argue the US government's most important role. Anyway, let's go back for a second. So, it's not just the insurance idea. you touched on this, but it's also the idea that like you can get a massive windfall when there's a market crash and then you can use that money to actually go on a buying spree at a time when markets are cheap and everyone else is, you know, short on cash and they can't do the same. How do you actually deploy that into practice and how do you scale for instance an expected windfall against the type of assets that you could potentially buy?</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 是的，我认为这就是第一性原理思维变得非常重要的地方。所以你必须看到每个投资组合都是不同的，对吧？所以我认为人们犯的另一个错误是，他们认为你可以随便拿起一本金融101的书，然后说每个投资组合都是一样的。它们都是风险中性的，每个人都完全相同。事实并非如此。一个资金比率为40%或50%的公共基金与一个90%或一个120%完全充足资金的银行非常不同。对吧？所以每个人都有不同的需求。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think this this is where the first principles thinking becomes really important. So you have to look at every portfolio is different, right? So one of the other mistakes I think people make is they think you can just pick up a finance 101 book and say every portfolio is identical. It's all risk neutral and everybody is exactly the same. It's just not the case. Public fund that has a 40% or 50% funded ratio is very different than a 90% or a you know bank that's 120% fully funded. Right? So everybody has different needs.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 你要做的第一件事是，查看底层投资组合的态势。你能承受多少损失？查看他们实际能承受的系统性风险冲击。所以你进行一次冲击测试，进行一次完整的分布分析，然后找出在何种结果下他们会承受如此大的困境或压力，以至于他们可能不得不清算资产。现在确实有相当多的这样的情况，如果股票市场下跌20%，私人市场也下跌大约20%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first thing that you do is you look at the underlying portfolio's posture. How much loss can you take? look at the systemic risk shocks that they can actually withstand. So you run a shock, you run a full distribution analysis and figure out what is the outcome under which they will be under so much distress or so much duress that they might end up having to liquidate assets. And there are actually quite a few like that right now where if the stock market went down 20%. And privates went down about 20%.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 为了筹集流动性进行分配，他们将不得不出售“种子资本”（seed corn）。对吧？所以情况真的非常糟糕。所以这是一个你想要量化的生存风险。所以你要做的第一件事是，找出那个风险是什么。一个完整的产出分布，然后你查看市场中可用的工具集，从最可靠的开始，令人惊讶的是，就像Joe已经提到的，最便宜的工具是股票期权波动率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In order to raise liquidity for distribution, they would have to actually sell seed corn, right? So it's really really bad. So that's an existential risk that you want to quantify. So the first thing that you do is you figure out what that risk is. A full distribution of outcomes and then you look at the instrument set that's out there in the marketplace starting from the most reliable and surprisingly enough like Joe mentioned already the cheapest one which is equity option volatility.

Veneer Benali: 你可以购买那些看跌期权，但那些不愿意支付大量持续溢价的人，你可以做更复杂的技巧，例如购买间接对冲，例如信用违约互换（credit default swaps）。今天，如果你不看图表，CDX指数实际上比全球金融危机（GFC）之前更紧，这是有史以来最紧的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">you can buy those put options but people who are not willing to pay a lot of continuous premium you can do more sophisticated tricks where you can buy indirect hedges for instance credit default swaps today the CDX index if you don't see the charts it's actually tighter than it was pre the GFC it's the tightest it's ever been</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 因为人们为了“表面收益”（cosmetic yield）而购买它，所以有很多衍生品工具。表面收益简单来说就是，如果你看今天的公司债券收益率，总收益率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because people are buying it for cosmetic yield reasons so there are a lot of derivative inst cosmetic yield simply means that the total yield if you look at the yield of a corporate bond today.</p>

Veneer Benali: 它基本上是国债收益率加上一些利差。所以国债收益率大约是4.5%到4%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is basically treasury yield plus some spreads. So the treasury yields are at call it 4 and a half 4%.</p>

Veneer Benali: 但利差实际上非常紧，CDX只有50个基点。所以你得到了5%到6%的收益率。

<p class="english-text">Okay, keep going.</p>

Veneer Benali: 是的，这是一种表面收益。你装饰过的收益。所以对我来说，这种收益并不足以证明其底层风险的合理性。所以你可以使用各种工具，并创建这些类型的对冲组合。

<p class="english-text">Yeah, it's a cosmetic yield. Your decorated yield. So to me the yield is not justified by the risks that are underlyed. So there's various instruments that you can use and create a portfolio of these types of hedges.</p>

Joe: 尾部风险对冲在业务上，从人们购买它的结构来看，它像保险吗？它像保险一样，人们每年都会重新购买，比如在新的一年开始时，我会考虑我想要进行什么样的尾部风险对冲等等，或者它是一种会自动续订并需要不断支付费用的东西，还是可以一劳永逸地设置，是一种永久性的配置，就像尾部风险对冲一样？请告诉我们出售尾部风险对冲的业务。

<p class="english-text">Is tailor risk hedging like insurance from a business from a structure of how people buy it? Is it like insurance where people sort of reload every year in a sort of okay start of the new year what is the tail risk I want to put on etc or something that renews and they have to keep paying a fee or is it just sort of something that can be set it and forget it a permanent allocation that sort of the tail risk hedge like talk to us about the business of selling a tail risk hedge</p>

Veneer Benali: 是的，当然。所以它上升到最高层面，成为你们开始讨论的投资组合构建的一部分，这是一个资产配置决策。

<p class="english-text">yeah so definitely so it goes up to the highest level where this becomes part of where you guys started portfolio construction it's an asset allocation decision Yeah,</p>

Veneer Benali: 这不是一笔交易。所以背景必须是，如果所有参与者都准备就绪，这意味着董事会和受托人等等，他们将这个决策视为保护投资组合，使其成为DNA的一部分，从而使投资组合更加稳健，而尾部风险成为你长期重新平衡投资组合的一部分。好的。这就是你建立战略投资组合的方式。但回到你的观点，每年，是的，你必须续签这份保单。你必须重新承诺支付保费。现在如果你愿意，你可以预付未来五年的保费。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it's not a trade. So the context has to be that if the agents are all lined up, meaning boards and trustees and so on, they think of this decision as protecting the portfolio, making a more robust portfolio as part of the DNA and the tail becomes part of the how you rebalance your portfolio over the long term. Okay. So that's how you set up the strategic portfolio. But then to your point, every year, yes, you have to renew this policy. You re have to recommmit premiums. Now you can preund for the next 5 years if you wanted to</p>

Tracy: 在您看来，最糟糕的尾部风险对冲是什么样的？是它太贵了，还是在市场大跌时根本不起作用？尾部风险策略的终极罪过是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What would be the worst kind of tail risk hedging in your view? Is it you know too expensive or does it not actually work when there is a big market crash? Like what is the ultimate sin of a tail risk strategy?</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 终极罪过绝对是那种承诺有效但实际上无效的策略。对吧？所以很多人试图通过创建合成策略来降低成本，对吧？我之前已经提到，期货市场在你需要时并不深，但有很多策略实际上使用了期货复制策略。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ultimate sin absolutely is the one which promises to work but doesn't work. Right. So a lot of people try to reduce your cost by creating synthetic strategies, right? I already mentioned futures markets aren't very deep when you need them, but there's a lot of strategies which actually use a futures replication strategy</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 就像1987年的股灾也声称要这样做。而那些策略通常不起作用。所以有很多策略承诺有效，看起来更便宜，而且不会造成任何损失，但它们也无法兑现。这又回到了4月2日，在4月2日到4月8日期间，唯一有效的是使用指数期权进行可靠的对冲，久期对冲不起作用，趋势跟踪不起作用，许多其他另类风险溢价策略也不起作用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">like the 1987 crash also purported to do. And those strategies typically don't work. And so there's many that promise and they look like they are cheaper and they don't cost any bleed but they also do not deliver which again going back to April 2nd the only thing that worked during that April 2nd to April 8th period was reliable hedging using index options nothing duration didn't work trend following didn't work a lot of other altruis premium strategies didn't work</p>

</details>

Joe: 是的。正如你所说，要谈论购买尾部风险对冲，你必须先了解基金面临的**生存风险**是什么，不同的基金根据其资金充足程度，会有不同类型的生存风险。因此，一个资金充足率达120%的实体，其风险情景显然与一个资金充足率只有40%的实体大相径庭。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. As you mentioned that to even talk about buying a tail risk hedge, you have to sort of understand is what is the existential risk for the fund and different funds have different flavors of existential risk depending on how funded they are. And so obviously an entity that's 120% funded is going to have very different risk scenarios than one that's 40% funded.</p>
</details>

Joe: 但你说了一些有趣的话，我一直在不同的背景下思考很多，那就是金融系统或实体经济对股市持续上涨的杠杆程度有多高？这有多重要？以及在什么情况下，即使是横盘整理的股市，更不用说下跌，也会对可能崩溃的事物构成风险？你知道，我们过去认为信用是会崩溃的东西。但我想知道现在问题是否出在股票领域，如果股权价值不上升，你就会真正遇到问题。请告诉我们更多关于你所说的，如果股市有一天停止上涨，并持续一段时间，对各种重要的经济参与者会发生什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But you said something interesting which is that and I've been thinking about this a lot in a different context which is how levered is the financial system or the real economy to an ongoing rise in the stock market? How important is that? And at what point does even a sideways stock market, let alone a decline become risky for something that could break? And you know, we used to think credit is the thing that breaks. But I wonder if it's in the stock area thing now where you really get the problem if the equity values don't go up. Tell us more about what you said about what happens to various types of economically important players. If the stock market one day stops going up for uh sustained period of time,</p>

### 金融系统的杠杆化与美联储独立性风险

Veneer Benali: 我认为你会遇到大问题，对吧？所以，不仅是股票，整个系统，包括**401(k)养老金计划**（401(k): 美国的一种雇主赞助的退休储蓄计划，允许员工税前缴纳工资，投资于各种基金）和公共养老金，它们都与股票市场挂钩，因为这是你获得7%、12%或8%实际收益的唯一途径。所以，如果股票市场不能持续上涨并提供那种回报，就很难达到那个目标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think you have a big problem, right? So, so not only is the stock the whole system 401ks and public pensions, they're all levered up to the stock market because that's the only way you can get to your 7 12 or 8% actual yield. So, if the stock market doesn't keep going up and keep delivering those kind of returns, it's very hard to get to that point.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 也许如果通货膨胀上升，至少在表面上，长期债券可能会达到7%或8%。每个人都可以锁定并免疫，你就达到了目标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Maybe if inflation rises, at least again cosmetically, maybe the long bond gets up to 7% or 8%. And everybody can just lock it in and immunize and you're there.</p>

Veneer Benali: 但从实际来看，30年后你退休时将没有所需的收入。

</details>

Veneer Benali: 是的，没错。所以这个系统杠杆化程度很高。然后企业信用显然非常非常集中。我们都读过关于评级等等。但基于默顿模型（Merton model）的企业信用，它再次将股票与**企业信用利差**（Corporate Credit Spreads: 企业债券收益率与同期限无风险政府债券收益率之间的差额，反映了市场对企业信用风险的补偿要求）联系起来，也与股票市场挂钩。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, exactly. So the system is very levered. And then corporate credit clearly is very very concentrated. We all read about payings and so on. But corporate credit based on the merrenton model again that connects equities to corporate credit spreads is also leveraged the stock market.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 如果股票市场突然大幅下跌，企业信用利差就会扩大，这才是真正的问题，对吧？因为如果企业信用利差扩大，所有公司的借贷成本都会上升，也许不是那些FANG股票，而是其他493只股票，那么系统如何生产？因为我们的整个系统都建立在借贷之上。而且我认为美国没有多少公司能在运营成本每年达到10%的情况下正常运作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that the stock market suddenly had a big sell-off, corporate credits widen out, which is the real problem, right? Because if corporate credit widens out and the cost of borrowing goes up for all the corporations, maybe not the fang stocks, but the 493 other stocks, then how does the system produce? Because our whole system is based on borrowing. And I don't think very many companies in the US can function if your cost of operating your business was 10% a year.</p>
</details>

Joe: 好的。好的。那么，说到这里，我们如果请来一位尾部风险专家，却不问他短期到中期内最大的风险是什么，那将是我们的疏忽。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Okay. Well, on that note, we would be remiss to have a tail risk person here and not ask what's the big risk that you see on the horizon in let's just say the short to medium term.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 我认为对我来说，目前最大的风险是人们一直在谈论的，你知道，所谓的，我称之为所谓的，美联储独立性范式转变，因为我不相信美联储曾经真正完全独立过，但现在它变得显而易见，即财政和货币当局实际上是一体的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think for me the biggest risk right now is uh what people have been talking about is you know the so-called and I call it so-called the Fed independence paradigm shift because I don't believe the Fed was ever really fully independent but now it's coming to the four that the fiscal and monetary authorities are actually one.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 所以，如果美联储真的成为中央政府、财政当局的一部分，那么后果会怎样？我认为到那时，所有的赌注都作废了，因为那是每个人，无论是否现实，都一直坚守的唯一支柱。但如果利率仅仅根据为某事融资的需要而改变，那将彻底颠覆金融体系。所以对我来说，这是目前最大的单一风险。那么这会演变成通货膨胀风险吗？例如，你会专注于如何抵消这种风险吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what happens in the aftermath if the Fed actually becomes part of the central government, the fiscal authorities, I think at that point all bets are off because that's the one anchor that everybody whether uh realistically or not has held on to. But if interest rates can change just based on the need to finance something that totally upside downs the financial system. So to me that's the single biggest risk right now. So would that materialize into an inflationary risk for instance and then would you be focused on what you can do to offset that?</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 是的，通货膨胀风险，我认为最好的期权交易之一，再次强调，这不是直接期权。所以回到你之前问的问题，你不总是需要支付溢价。**收益率曲线陡峭化交易**（Yield Curve Steepener: 一种利率交易策略，预期短期利率将下降或长期利率将上升，从而使收益率曲线变得更陡峭），你买入收益率曲线的短端，卖出收益率曲线的长端。今天你可以通过使用互换（swaps）等方式进行，基本上是零净利差。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, inflationary risk and I think one of the best option trades again this is not a direct option. So going back to what you were asking before you don't always just have to pay premium the yield curve steepener where you buy the short end of the yield curve and you sell the long end of the yield curve. Today you can do it through using swaps and all that for essentially zero net carry.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 所以这是一个期权，非常类似于几年前在欧洲做空负收益债券市场，如果你进行收益率曲线陡峭化交易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So here's an option very similar to shorting the negatively bond market in Europe a few years ago where if you put a yield curve steepener on</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 无论是在恶性通货膨胀（也许不是恶性，但通货膨胀率很高）情景下，还是在美联储激进降息的情况下，收益率曲线都会陡峭化。所以是的，这种环境是一种收益率曲线陡峭化交易可能奏效的环境。是的，我的零阶预测是，如果我们失去美联储明确的独立性，收益率曲线实际上会变得更加陡峭。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">either in a hyperinflationary maybe not hyper but a lot high inflationary scenario or in an aggressive Fed cut the yield curve steepens. So yes, so that environment is an environment in which the curve steepener could work. And yes, my zeroth order prior forecast would be that if we lose explicit independence of the Fed, the yield curve actually steepens a lot more.</p>
</details>

Joe: 我对此很感兴趣。所以，你知道，你刚才谈到了最近的时代，以及60年代和80年代，事情可能有点失控，然后是沃尔克时代，然后是后疫情时代，现在又出现了美联储剩余独立性是否面临风险的问题。你知道，你是一名物理学家，或者说你这个领域很多人都是数学家。你能在多大程度上“用数学解决问题”呢？因为很多问题都超出了数学范畴，那么当你处理联邦储备系统是否能保持独立性这样的政治系统问题时，你如何看待定量分析的局限性？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Something I'm interested in. So, you know, you were talking about the recent eras and the the 60s and 80s and things may have gotten a little unglued and then the Vulkar era and then the postcoid era and now this question about whether what's left of Fed independence is at risk. You know, you're a physicist and or a lot of people in your space are mathematicians. Is there a limit to how much you can sort of math it out so to speak? because a lot of these questions are external to mathematics and so how do you think about the limits of quantitative analysis when we're dealing with things like will the political system allow the Federal Reserve to remain independent?</p>
</details>

### 量化分析的局限性与未来展望

Veneer Benali: 是的，我认为很多实际上是非定量的，尽管我来自定量背景，但我学到的是，重要的不是数学本身，而是你可以用来得出结论的逻辑论证序列。对吧？例如，甚至在发现花哨的数学，你知道，拉格朗日量等等之前，我们就知道重力是存在的。重力的存在在数学发明之前可能就已经知道了，但重力一直都在那里。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think a lot of it is actually non-quantitative and what I've learned even though I come from a quantitative background, it's not the math itself, but it's the sequence of logical arguments that you can make to get to a conclusion. Right? So for instance, we knew even before fancy mathematics was discovered uh you know lrangeians and so on that gravity exists. Gravity's existence has been known before maybe math was invented but gravity has been there</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 所以我认为金融有一些核心规律仍然会继续存在，无论它们的数学模型如何。你知道，当我与比尔·格罗斯（Bill Gross）共事时，他常说有些事情我们可以视为理所当然，我是在转述他的话，但收益率曲线的陡峭程度，以及收益率曲线需要向上倾斜才能使金融系统正常运作的事实，因为人们借出资金是为了获得回报。这些都不是数学工具。它们真的只是资本主义系统运作的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so I think there's some central laws of finance which will still continue to exist uh regardless of the mathematical modeling of them and you know the bill gross when I used to work with him he used to say some things we can take for granted I'm paraphrasing it but the steepness of the yield curve the fact that the yield curve needs to be upward sloped for the financial system to function because people lend money in order to get something in turn. Those are not mathematical devices. Those are really just the way the capitalist system works.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 所以我认为你可以将定量建模推向其自身的极限。但我们的系统中发生了一些事情，我们现在正处于一个点，金融市场的“重力”可以说将不得不接管。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think you can take the quantitative modeling to its own limit. But there are certain things that have happened in our system where we're at a point now where gravity so to speak of the financial markets are going to have to take over.</p>
</details>

Joe: 但大概，如果你无法预测政治，因为它非常困难，尤其是在现在。如果你无法预测政治，那么也许调整你的头寸规模变得更重要。所以数学实际上成为处理正在发生的非数学不确定性元素的一种方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But presumably also if you can't predict the politics because it's very difficult especially nowadays. If you can't predict the politics then maybe right sizing your positions becomes more important. And so the maths actually becomes one way of dealing with the very uncertainty non-mmathematical element of what's going on.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 是的。没错。我认为更进一步来说。所以相关性是自1980年代中期到2020年以来最伟大的礼物。对吧。所以你有股票和债券，就说是60/40。股票上涨，债券上涨，它们是多元化的，这是一个多么美好的境地。对吧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Exactly. And I think to take that point one step further. So correlation has been the greatest gift since the 19 mid 80s to to 2020. Right. So you got stocks and bonds just say 6040. Stocks went up, bonds went up and they were diversifying which is what a beautiful place to be in. Right. It</p>
</details>

Joe: 听起来不错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">sounds nice.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 所以那是一个免费的午餐。再次强调，这又回到了金融“重力”的说法，那种免费午餐的状态不应该存在。所以我认为我们可能正在进入一个股票和债券可能不再具有多元化作用的阶段，你必须寻找其他东西。当然是黄金，正如你提到的，也许是比特币，谁知道呢，但我认为可靠的保险或投资组合保护今天通过期权市场如此容易获得，对我来说将是我会关注的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So so that was a freebie. And again this goes back to financial gravity so to speak that state of affairs that free lunch should not exist. So I think we might be entering a phase where stocks and bonds maybe are actually not diversifying and you have to look at other things. Gold of course as you mentioned maybe Bitcoin who knows but I think the fact that reliable insurance or portfolio protection is so available today using the options market to me would be the place where I would look.</p>
</details>

Joe: 当你今天看美国收益率曲线的长端时，是否存在一种因素，即这些对美联储失去独立性的担忧正在被定价？如果突然间你能弹指一挥，确切地知道美联储在未来20年将像过去20年一样运作，会有变化吗？是否存在一些担忧的余地？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When you look at the long end of the yield curve today in the US, is there an element in which these concerns about the loss of Fed independence are being priced in right now? If suddenly you could snap your finger and know for a fact that the Fed will operate as it has been for the last 20 years, for the next 20 years, would there be a change? Is there some margin that concern there?</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 你知道吗？我不知道美联储是否会像过去一样致力于对抗通货膨胀。因此，我今天要求额外的收益率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know what? I don't know if the Fed is going to be a committed inflation fighter as well as it has been in the past. Therefore, I'm demanding extra yield today.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 不，还没有。我不这么认为。也许溢价略有上升。但系统最显著的特征之一是，如果你看国债收益率，今天的30年期债券是4.70%。但你看看30年期利率互换，它的交易价格是，信不信由你，3.89%。所以，它比美国国债低了将近85个基点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, not yet. I don't think so. Maybe a slight amount of premium has gone up. But one of the most striking features of the system is that if you look at the Treasury yields, look at the 30-year bond today is 470. But you look at the 30-year interest rate swap, it's trading at, believe it or not, 389, right? So, it's almost 85 basis points under the US Treasury.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 现在你问，为什么有人会以较低的收益率进行互换市场交易？我从1990年代互换市场诞生以来就一直在交易互换。互换利差是负85。这又回到了许多大型机构为了对冲负债而接收利率互换。所以他们肯定没有将通货膨胀效应计入互换市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, you ask, why would somebody take the uh swap market at a lower yield? And I've been trading swaps since its inception back in the 1990s. Swap spreads are negative 85. And that goes back to the receiving of interest rate swaps to hedge liabilities by a lot of large institutions. So they have certainly not priced in inflationary effects into the swap market.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 但在某个时候，这也必须达到平衡。所以在我看来，它还没有被定价。也许现在定价还为时过早，因为也许美联储不会失去独立性，你知道，会像凤凰一样从灰烬中重生。但我对此有点悲观。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But at some point this has to also equiliiberate. So in my view it has not been priced in. Maybe it's too early to price in because maybe the Fed does not lose its independence and you know rises as phoenix from the ashes. But uh I'm a little bit pessimistic about it.</p>
</details>

Tracy: 回到您在华尔街的辉煌职业生涯，您玩**骗子扑克**（Liar's Poker: 一种使用美元钞票序列号进行猜测和虚张声势的扑克游戏，在华尔街交易员中流行）玩得怎么样？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Just going back to your storied career on Wall Street for a second, how good were you at playing Liars Poker?</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 我其实玩得很好。我想，我的意思是，我在加入所罗门兄弟公司（Solomon Brothers）之后才学会的，那是一群很棒的人。我想第一年我可能输了一些，但我想在我在那里的第三年，我赢了，而且我实际上是，我想是赢得最大奖金的人，而且我的老板还把他的18英尺渔船给了我，但他当时正在买一艘新的，作为我所知道的和解协议的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was actually pretty good. I uh think I mean I learned it after I joined Solomon Brothers was a good group of people and I think the first year maybe I lost a bit but I think in the third year that I was there I won it and I was actually uh I think the one who took the biggest spot and I also my boss gave me his uh 18 ft fishing boat but he was buying a new one as part of the settlement that I knew.</p>
</details>

Joe: 是的，代替现金。他就像是“拿走我的吧”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah in lie of cash. He was like here take my own.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 嗯，我想是现金加上船。所以是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well cash plus the boat I think. So yeah</p>
</details>

Joe: 那真是个大奖。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that's a really big pot.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 那是个大奖。是的。当时，我们每天交易结束后都会玩。我们每天都会打印出随机的骗子扑克牌。通常大约有24或30张，我们每天会玩大约30轮。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That was a big pot. Yeah. At that point, we used to spend after the trading day was over. Every day we would print out randomized liars poker sheets. Uh, usually about 24 or 30 of them, and we'd play about 30 30 rounds every day.</p>
</details>

Tracy: 等等，骗子扑克牌。我以为你们是用真钱玩的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wait, Liars poker sheets. I thought you played with actual cash.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 是的。所以，真钱是用美元钞票玩的，但是，你知道，如果你玩24轮，就没有足够的美元钞票飞来飞去了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, actual cash you play with dollar bills, but uh, you know, if you're playing 24 rounds, there are not enough dollar bills flying around.</p>
</details>

Joe: 我从没想过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I never thought of that.</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 是的。所以，你根据美元钞票号码的生成方式进行随机化。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, you randomize based on how the dollar bill numbers are generated. Yeah.</p>
</details>

Joe: 对于今天的年轻物理学生或高中数学迷来说，金融领域还有未来吗？你知道，人们担心人工智能等等，但对于一个有量化思维的年轻人。您是否相信他们未来在金融领域会有自己的角色？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is there going to be a future in finance for a young physics student or a math nerd in high school today? You know, people worry about this with AI and so forth, but a young person who's quantitatively minded. Do you feel confident that there will be a role for them in finance in the future?</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 绝对有。我认为金融从一开始就存在，因为它基于两种基本情感，对吧？贪婪和恐惧，对吧？所以只要有贪婪和恐惧，有聪明的人在身边，而且再次回到数学和物理学，并不是说工具本身教会你任何特别的东西。它只是教你以一种有纪律的逻辑方式思考。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Absolutely. I think finance has existed from the very very beginning because it's based on the two fundamental emotions, right? Greed and fear, right? So as long as there's greed and fear and there's smart people around uh and again going back to math and physics it's not so much that the toolkit itself is teaching you anything special. It's just it teaches you think in a discipline logical fashion</p>
</details>

Veneer Benali: 我认为随着我们看到的人工智能等工具，以及编程变得完全民主化。我认为严谨地提出重要问题的能力变得更加重要。所以我认为未来会比现在更好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I think with tools like what we're seeing with AI and so on and coding becoming completely democratized. I think the ability to ask important questions rigorously becomes even more important. So I think it's going to be even better than it's been.</p>

### 播客总结与反思

Joe: Joe，这真的很有趣。我们应该请他回来，做一期关于1990年代华尔街故事的节目。我们可以这样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Joe, that was really fun. We should have an back and just do like stories from Wall Street in the 1990s episode. We could do that.</p>
</details>

Tracy: 我喜欢这些故事。我们可以在故事方面做得更多，我也对基本上，你知道，投资组合构建的哲学感兴趣。我的意思是，显然有投资组合构建的数学，但我对许多关于投资组合构建的对话，包括这次对话，确实有些不满。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I love the stories. We could do a lot more on the stories and I'm also interested in like basically you know the philosophy of portfolio construction. I mean obviously there's the math of portfolio construction but I do have a certain dissatisfaction with many conversations about portfolio construction including this</p>
</details>

Joe: 从何说起？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">in what sense?</p>
</details>

Tracy: 嗯，多元化的股票几乎总是上涨。所有保险，我的意思是，我想我还可以问另一个问题是，人类历史上所有关于股票市场的保险合同本质上都是浪费吗？因为股票市场处于历史高位。我对此有疑问。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well diversified stocks have almost always gone up. Has every insurance I mean I guess another question that I could could have asked is has every insurance contract on the stock market essentially so far been a waste in human history because the stock market is at all-time highs. I have I have questions about that.</p>
</details>

Tracy: 与此相反的观点是，随着我年龄增长，在我的生活中和我的投资组合中，我开始意识到，在市场下跌时醒来，然后说：“哦，天哪。我的401(k)养老金计划今天彻底被摧毁了。”但如果我看看，你知道，我的其他头寸或其他尾部风险对冲，比如它们实际上上涨了一点，抵消了一些痛苦。如果我真的不得不在那天清算我的投资组合，因为无论什么原因，我必须支付抵押贷款或其他，那么我就会有一些额外的现金可以支配。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The counterpoint to that is, and I've I've come to realize this as I get older in my life and in my portfolio, is there is something nice about like waking up during a sell-off and going like, "Oh, shoot. My 401k has been absolutely decimated today." But if I look at, you know, some other position or some other tail risk hedge that I have, like that's actually up a little bit and it's offset some of the pain. And if I actually had to cash out of my portfolio on that day because of whatever I had to make a mortgage payment or whatever, then I would have some extra cash to spare.</p>
</details>

Tracy: 而且你可以通过拥有这些额外的现金来获得额外的回报，这些现金可以让你进入市场廉价购买东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you could get an extra return by having that extra cash available to you to then go into the market and buy stuff on the cheap.</p>
</details>

Joe: 我认为我们真的应该有一个《OddLots》ETF，它宣传其缺乏流动性，你不能出售它。如果你现在需要现金，这不是适合你的工具。如果你把钱投入其中，不要指望30年内再见到它。但好处是，它会阻止你在所有东西都下跌的那一天做出糟糕的非理性决定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that we really should have an odd lots ETF that is advertises its illquidity that you can't sell this. If you need cash now, this is not the instrument for you. If you are putting your money in this, don't expect to see it again for 30 years. But the plus side is it will keep you from making bad, irrational decisions on a day when everything is red.</p>
</details>

Tracy: 我的意思是，这有价值。这有价值。而且能够，你知道，睡得更安心一点也有价值，因为你有不同的头寸。但无论如何，我们今天就到这里吗？

<p class="english-text">I mean, there's there's a value in that. There's a value in that. And there's also a value in being able to, you know, sleep at night a little easier because you have different positions. But anyway, should we leave it there?</p>
