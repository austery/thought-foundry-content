### 蟒蛇与CEO的开场

**主持人**: 这条**缅甸蟒蛇**想知道《CEO日记》里有什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: This Burmese python wants to know what is inside the diary of a CEO.

</details>

**主持人**: 我的天。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Oh my god.

</details>

**主持人**: 太棒了。你现在感觉如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Beautiful. Now, what are you feeling right now?

</details>

**保罗**: 我在想我为什么要做这个谋生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Wondering why I do this for a living.

</details>

**主持人**: 你以前有没有和一条10英尺长的蛇隔着桌子做播客？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Have you ever done a podcast with a 10-ft snake across the table before?

</details>

**保罗**: 不，这是我第一次。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: No, this is my first.

</details>

**主持人**: 太棒了。那我们请下一位朋友出来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Awesome. And then we'll bring out the next friend.

</details>

**保罗**: 别把它带过来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Don't bring it over here.

**主持人**: 别动。

**主持人**: Just don't move.

### 亚马逊20年：冒险与守护

**主持人**: 保罗，你过去20年都在做什么？你背着背包，赤脚拿着砍刀，住在**亚马逊雨林**，不惜一切代价帮助原住民拯救亚马逊，这意味着被鳄鱼咬伤、被蛇咬伤、患上非常罕见的疾病，甚至被**贩毒集团**追捕。照片上的那个人，他的伤疤是因为他在试图与未接触部落进行和平接触时，被一支七英尺长的箭射中了头部。这实际上是一个非常重要的故事，我想我这里有段视频。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Paul, what have you spent the last 20 years of your life doing? living out of a backpack in the Amazon rainforest barefoot with a machete to help the indigenous people save the Amazon whatever it takes which means crocodile bites snake very rare diseases hunted by the narot traffickers with a picture of that guy that scar is because he was shot in the head by a 7ft arrow while he was trying to make peaceful contact with the unconted tribes and this is actually a very important story I think I have a video of this

</details>

**保罗**: 是的，这是全球首次曝光的画面。这个部落生活在丛林深处，与世隔绝，他们从没听说过勺子、轮子或耶稣。他们出来寻求接触。我们连夜进行了两天的船程，穿越了我见过的最糟糕的雷暴。他们很害怕，我们也害怕，因为这些部落经常杀人。他们只有一个问题：我们怎么区分好人和坏人？你看，这些人正被**贩毒者**、**淘金者**和**伐木工人**追捕，被**森林砍伐**困住。但如果我们的雨林海洋正在消失，地球上的生命将无法存续。现在还不算太晚，但我们是能拯救它的最后一代。保罗，现在的孩子们从小就离不开屏幕，孤独感达到了历史最高点。你在这15年里学到的东西，对像我这样的西方人来说，有什么用处吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: yeah this is world first footage so tribe isolated so deep in the jungle that they've never heard of a spoon or the wheel or Jesus was coming out to make contact. So, we do a 2-day boat journey in one night through the worst thunderstorm I've ever seen. They were scared. We were scared because these tribes kill people all the time. And they had one question. How do we tell the bad guys from the good guys? You see, these people are being hunted by traffickers and gold miners and loggers and boxed in by deforestation. But if our oceans of rainforests are vanishing, life on Earth is not possible. Now, it's not too late, but we're the last generation that can save it. Paul, young kids are growing up attached to screens and loneliness is at an all-time high. Is there anything that you learned in those 15 years that a westerner like me would find useful?

</details>

**保罗**: 百分之百有用。我们从“目的”开始说起。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: 100%. So, let's start with purpose.

</details>

**主持人**: 保罗，你过着非凡的生活，一种非常规的非凡生活。你过去20年都在做什么？试图探索亚马逊最原始的地区，并找到拯救它们的方法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Paul, you live an extraordinary life. A very atypical extraordinary life. What have you spent the last 20 years of your life doing? trying to find a way to explore the wildest parts of the Amazon and figure out a way to save them.

</details>

**主持人**: 对于许多不了解这个世界的人来说，亚马逊可能只是一片有很多野生动物的树林。对亚马逊真实本质的核心误解是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: The Amazon, for a lot of people that don't know anything about this part of the world, they'll think of it as a bunch of trees where lots of wild animals live. What is the sort of central misunderstanding of the true nature of the Amazon?

</details>

**保罗**: 我认为这是一个规模问题。人们不理解亚马逊的重要性。这是我们星球上最关键的事物之一，也是我们星球最具物理特征的标志之一。如果你从太空看地球，你会看到南美洲大部分地区有一条巨大的绿色地带，那就是**亚马逊雨林**。那里蕴藏着我们五分之一的淡水，并生产着我们五分之一的氧气。这个系统对地球上所有生命都具有不可替代的价值。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: I think it's a problem of scale. People don't understand the importance of the Amazon. This is one of the most crucial things on our planet. It's one of the most physically defining features of our planet. If you look at Earth from space, you see this giant green belt over most of South America. That's the Amazon rainforest, and that's where one-fifth of our fresh water is contained, and another fifth of our oxygen is produced. This system is irreplaceably valuable to all life on Earth.

</details>

**主持人**: 你住在亚马逊。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And you live in the Amazon.

</details>

**保罗**: 过去20年，我大部分时间都住在亚马逊。我成年后在户外睡觉的夜晚比在室内多，因为我结识了亚马逊上游雨林的**原住民**。我的书就是关于这个的。我18岁时去了那里，因为我需要冒险。然后，对冒险的追求引出了对意义的呼唤。接着，这又让我发现，我们是唯一能阻止推土机和电锯摧毁我们所爱之物的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: For the last 20 years, I've lived mostly in the Amazon. I've slept more nights outdoors than I have in my adult life because I befriended the indigenous people of the upper Amazon rainforest. And that's what the book is about. It's I went down there at 18 years old because I needed adventure. And then the quest for adventure led for this call to meaning. And then that led to the discovery that we were the only ones who could do anything to stop the bulldozers and the chainsaws from destroying the thing that we loved.

</details>

**主持人**: 很多人出于各种原因点开了这个对话。你认为我们今天会谈论什么对他们的生活有意义的话题？你每天的对话中，有哪些广泛的话题能吸引人们？因为我想在深入细节之前，给他们一个简要的概述。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: A lot of people have clicked on this conversation for whatever reason. What are we going to talk about today that you think might be interesting to them in their lives and what is the wide variety of things from the conversations you have every single day that compels people cuz I want to give them a bit of a tlddr before we get into the detail.

</details>

**保罗**: 我认为人们会发现，这也是我试图在书中描述的，就是我最初并不知道自己要去哪里。我只知道我热爱什么。因此，在过去的20年里，我一直在追随一个方向的梦想。那个梦想就是找到一种方法，来缓解我对环境现状感受到的巨大压力。我们生活在这样一个时代，人们觉得世界末日即将来临，我们无能为力。我们的海洋正在崩溃，雨林正在消失，大象正被猎杀至灭绝。我想知道，这些问题有解决方案吗？有没有办法改变**环保**的叙事，创造一个万事俱备的替代现实？你认为，在科技和**人工智能**以及我们所处的这种巨大转变的背景下，你的信息现在比以往任何时候都更及时吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: I think that what people are going to find and this is what I tried to write about was that I didn't know where I was going at first. I just knew what I loved. And so over the last 20 years, it's been following a dream in a direction. And that dream was finding a way to relieve the incredible stress that I felt over the the state of the environment. We live in these times where people feel like the world is ending. There's nothing we can do. Our oceans are collapsing. The rainforests are vanishing. Elephants are being hunted to extinction. And I wanted to know, are there solutions to these problems? Is there a way to change the narrative of conservation and come up with an alternative reality where everything's okay? And do you think your message is more timely now than ever with everything that's going on with technology and AI and this sort of great transition we're in?

</details>

**保罗**: 我认为这个信息现在很及时，因为无论我们喜不喜欢，我们都活在历史上最重要的时刻。之所以如此，是因为作为一个全球社会，我们从未像现在这样，全体面临着同一个问题。如果我们的生态系统崩溃，地球上的生命将不复存在。我们是历史上最后一代有机会在为时已晚之前恢复这些生态系统和神圣循环的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: I think that this message is timely now because whether we like it or not, we're alive at the most important moment in history. And the reason that that's true is because never before as a global society have we been all faced with the same problem. If our ecosystems collapse, life on Earth is not possible. And we are the last generation in history that's going to have a chance to restore those ecosystems. and those sacred cycles before it's too late.

### 远离屏幕的野性生活

**主持人**: 谈到心理健康，现在的孩子们从小就离不开屏幕和科技。你过去20年几乎过着截然相反的生活。我想知道，你今天来这里的时候提到，你甚至不知道怎么下**优步**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And as it relates to mental health, young kids are growing up attached to physical to screens and to technology and all these things. You've lived almost the opposite life. It appears for the last 20 years. I'm wondering if there's anything, you know, cuz you said today on your way here that you like didn't know how to get out of the Uber and

</details>

**保罗**: 是的，来这里真是个麻烦。我差点被一个认出我的人撞倒，他喊着：“**森蚺**男，快下车！”然后我从来没开过，我想我以前从没用按钮开过门，但我就是不知道怎么从优步里出来。接着，我在洗手间里经历了一场应该被拍下来的冒险。但我确实过着我们称之为“赤脚砍刀时代”的生活。我在亚马逊的早期学习，很多都是在**原住民专家**的指导下进行的。这些人，比如我刚到亚马逊时遇到的**JJ**，他直到13岁才穿鞋。所以他过着一种如果你想捕鱼，就必须去河边。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Yeah. No, it was a it was a mess getting here. I almost got run over by a guy who recognized me and said and said, "Get out of the road, Anaconda guy." And then I'd never opened uh I guess I'd never opened a door with a button before, but I couldn't figure out how to get out of out of the Uber. And then uh I had I had a whole adventure in the bathroom that should have been filmed. Um but no, I mean I have lived uh we used to we call it the barefoot machete days. You know, a lot of my early learning in the Amazon took place under the toutelage of indigenous experts. And these are people that like JJ, who I meet when I first go down to the Amazon, he didn't have shoes until he was 13 years old. So he lived a life where if you want to fish, you have to go to the river.

</details>

**主持人**: 如果你想吃东西，就必须去森林里，而不是去超市。所以当你看到现在的孩子只用拇指时，人们感到脱节、迷失方向，不知道什么是真实、什么不是真实，这并不奇怪。因为你去到山川、雨水、天空和岩石之间，它们会很快教会你什么是真实的，你必须认同，否则你就会死去。丛林也是一样。当你发现自己处于这些化学和物理的边界之中时，生活会变得更有意义。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And if you want to eat, you have to go out into the forest, not to the supermarket. And so when you see kids today that are only using their thumbs, it's not too surprising when people are disconnected and disoriented and sort of don't know what's real and what's not real anymore. Because you go to the mountains and the rain and the sky and the rocks, we'll teach you what's real real quick and you all have to agree on it or else you'll die. And the jungle is the same thing. It's sort of when you find yourself with these chemical physical boundaries, life makes a lot more sense.

</details>

**主持人**: 你在亚马逊待过一段时间后，是否更能理解像我这样的人的生活？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Have you been able to make sense of the life that someone like me lives more because you've spent time in the Amazon?

</details>

**主持人**: 比如，你对我们的看法不同了吗？我知道这听起来很疯狂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Like, do you look at us differently? I know that sounds like a crazy thing to say,

</details>

**主持人**: 但就像人们可能会觉得你选择的生活方式非常奇怪一样，你会不会觉得像我这样一周七天都对着屏幕工作的人的生活也很奇怪？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: but in the same way that people might look at the way you choose to live your life and say, "This is very, very strange." Do you look at people that, you know, like me that work seven days a week behind a screen and think that's a very strange life?

</details>

**保罗**: 我只是知道我做不到。我非常依赖大自然。我必须在树林里。我伴着青蛙的叫声入睡。即使在城市里，我也会去寻找有很多树的地方。我简直就是个森林生物。如果你把我从我的环境中带走，我就会开始感到压力，甚至会死去。我的一部分会死去，如果你把我锁在钢筋水泥里，或者把我限制在某个地方。我上周在酒店进行书展宣传，我意识到房间里没有任何东西是天然的。地毯、桌子、窗户、电视，房间里的一切都是复合材料。我甚至打不开窗户呼吸外面的空气。我确实想过，我在想，其他人是否也感受到这种社会幽闭恐惧症？对我来说，我必须在某个时刻把脚浸在河里。我必须每晚睡觉前抬头看星星，这是一种仪式。我必须抬头看星星，否则你怎么祈祷？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: I just know that I couldn't do it. I I I depend almost almost I'm so reliant on nature. I have to be around trees. I fall asleep to frogs. I I mean even even being in a city, I go seek out a place where there's a lot of trees. I am like a forest creature. If you take me out of my environment, I start to stress and die. And there's a part of me that yes, that starts to die if you keep me locked in concrete or if you were to if you were to relegate me to a a I was just in a hotel last week on the book tour and I realized nothing in the room with me was natural. The carpet, the table, the windows, the television, everything that was in this room with me was composite materials. And I couldn't even open the window to get to the outside air. And I it did occur to me. I said, I wonder if other people feel this type of of of societal claustrophobia where to me it's I have to have my feet in a river at some point. I have to I have to every night before I fall asleep, I have to look up. It's a ritual. I have to look up and and look at the stars. How else can you pray?

</details>

**保罗**: 所以对我来说，生活在城市里与我习惯的现实非常不同。洗澡也是。相信我，站在冰冷的瓷砖盒子里冲水，远不如在丛林中奔跑、跳入河中游泳，让整条河流环绕着你那么有趣。这是一种完全不同的体验。所以，当我回来时，我会有点想念我的青蛙、鸟儿，以及丛林中的邻居们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And so for me, being in a city has become a very different reality to what I'm used I mean, just taking a shower. I mean, trust me, it's not as much fun standing in a cold tile box and spraying water on yourself as it is running through the jungle, diving into the river and swimming and the whole river rushing around you. It's a whole different experience. And so, when I come back, I get a little bit, you know, I miss my I miss the frogs and the birds and and sort of my neighbors of of of the jungle.

</details>

**主持人**: 你认为我们的生活方式存在一种集体错觉吗？你觉得我们是不是有点疯狂了？就像锅里的青蛙一样，这种技术上的侵蚀是如此逐渐发生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Do you think there's like a collective delusion in terms of the way we live our lives? Do do you think we're we've gone a bit crazy? Kind of like the frog in the frying pan. It's happened so gradually, the sort of technological

</details>

**主持人**: 我们的生活，现在的孩子们比以往任何时候都更焦虑和抑郁。孤独感达到了历史最高点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: creep of our lives that, you know, and we're looking at young kids that are more anxious and depressed than ever before. Loneliness is at an all-time high.

</details>

**主持人**: 服用抗抑郁药物的人比以往任何时候都多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: More people are taking anti-depressant medications than ever before.

</details>

**保罗**: 我认为对你的问题，简单的答案是“是”。我们这个物种就像一条离水的鱼，永远处于失衡状态。作为人类，我们已经远离了森林、沙漠、山脉和海洋。我们以前是渔民，是农民，而现在我们的生活与那时截然不同。如果你问孩子们肉是从哪里来的，有些孩子会说超市。他们不知道鸡在包装之前是活着的。所以，对于我们这一代人来说，我们是骑自行车的一代，我们可能是最后一批。我们早上出门，骑自行车，或者和朋友四处奔跑，然后回家吃晚饭。我非常幸运，周末可以去树林里。我会带一块牛排，一根火柴，还有我的金毛猎犬，然后我们会在山边迷路，去露营。我的规矩是：没有庇护所，一根火柴，一块牛排，一条狗。所以你不能把火柴弄湿。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: I think that yes is the simple answer to your question. That that that sort of we're a species perpet we're a fish perpetually out of water. that as humans because we've taken ourselves away from forests and away from deserts and away from mountains and the ocean. I mean, we used to be fishermen and we used to be farmers and and now the life that we live is so incredibly different than that. If you ask kids where does their meat come from, there are kids that will say the grocery store. You know, they don't know that chickens exist before it's in the package. And and so, you know, for for there was that generation, which I think that you and I are both a part of, where it was like we were the bicycle generation. We might be the last one where it was like you went out in the morning and you were on your bicycle or you were running around with your friends and you would come home for dinner and I was incredibly lucky to have, you know, on the weekends I would go to the woods. I would take a steak and I would take one match and I'd take my golden retriever and we would go get lost up the side of a mountain and uh we' just go camping. My rule was no shelter, one match, one stake dog. So you couldn't mess up the match.

</details>

**主持人**: 几岁的时候？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: At what age?

</details>

**保罗**: 大概12或14岁。我当时就是这样做的。我身边有一把小小的猎刀。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Uh I would say 12 or 14. I was doing this. I had a little, you know, hello hunting knife on my side.

</details>

**主持人**: 对于一个12岁的孩子来说，这不常见。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Not typical for a 12-year-old,

</details>

**保罗**: 但我需要它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: but I needed it.

</details>

**主持人**: 为什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Why?

</details>

**保罗**: 我不知道。我需要冒险。我想是因为被困在书桌前，被告知不能起身，甚至不能去洗手间，你只能低头，做我们说的，这种被控制的感觉与我的本质格格不入。所以我从小就渴望冒险。然后，在某个时候，我发现我探索的溪流不能直接饮用，或者即使我身处森林深处，我也知道如果我再徒步4小时，就能走出森林。我渴望体验真正的荒野，那种永无止境的荒野。我想看看地球上真正原始的地方。出于某种原因，这种渴望从小就存在于我心中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: I don't know. I needed adventure. I think because being being stuck in a desk and being told you can't get up and you can't even go to the bathroom, and you you look down, do what we say, just being controlled was so counterintuitive to my essence. And so, I grew up with this need for adventure. And then somewhere along the way, the fact that I couldn't drink the streams that I was exploring or the fact that even when I was deep, deep, deep in the forest, I knew that if I really hiked for another 4 hours, I'll come out the other side. I wanted to experience wilderness. I wanted to experience wilderness where it never ended. I wanted to see the really wild places on the planet. And for some reason, that was inside me since I was very young.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么，你是如何从那时起，从一个13岁的孩子，到17岁时在**秘鲁**开始亚马逊研究的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So, how did you go from there? from being that 13 year old to setting off at what 17 years old with your Amazon research in Peru.

</details>

**主持人**: 你确实上了大学。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You you did go to university. You

</details>

**主持人**: 我听说你其实非常非常聪明。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: you were actually really really smart. I I hear

</details>

**保罗**: 我足够聪明，他们既让我停学，又让我留校察看，同时我还是**美国门萨**的成员。我当时真是个问题少年。他们会让你觉得很笨，当你完不成作业时。他们会说：“你为什么数学不及格？为什么读不完这本书？为什么不做作业？”但我知道我很聪明，在森林里我擅长追踪，我能生存，能度过周末，能搭建庇护所。所以我总是倾向于这些。于是我跟我父母说了，我高中辍学了。你可以参加**GED**考试，提前两年毕业，只需一天的考试。我做到了。规定是我必须上大学。所以，我必须开始上学期，但在学期之间，我可以自由地去亚马逊雨林。于是我预订了最偏远的一个职位，那个地方离最近的城市坐船要两天才能到达这个小小的研究站。它由一个秘鲁人和他的搭档经营。他叫**JJ**。他就是为我打开亚马逊大门的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: I was smart enough that they had me both suspended and in in detention and in American Mensa. I was I was I was really all over the place. And and the thing is they make you feel stupid when you can't do the assignments. So I'd say, 'Why are you failing math and why can't you read this book and you didn't do your homework? But I was like, I know I'm smart and in the forest I was good at tracking and I could survive and I could make it through a weekend and I could build shelter. And so I always just gravitated towards that. And so I spoke to my parents. I dropped out of high school. You can take your GED and get out two years early with a with a with a with a one-day test. And I did that. The rule was I did have to go to university. So, I had to start taking semesters, but in between semesters, I was free to go to the Amazon rainforest. And so, I booked the most remote position that I could at a place where it took 2 days by boat from the nearest city to get to this tiny little research station. And it was run by this Peruvian guy and his partner. And his name was JJ. And that's the guy that opened the Amazon for me.

</details>

**主持人**: 他为你打开了亚马逊的大门？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: He opened the Amazon for you?

</details>

**保罗**: **JJ**作为原住民在亚马逊长大。所以他学到的东西，这本书的第一章叫做《最稀有的物种》，因为他是亚马逊雨林中唯一的独角兽。他是一个原住民。所以他一直在向他的祖祖辈辈学习。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Well, JJ grew up in the Amazon as an indigenous person. And so what he was learning, he the the first chapter in this book is called the rarest of species because he's the only unicorn in the Amazon rainforest. He's an indigenous person. So he's been learning from his grandfathers, grandfathers, grandfathers, grandfathers all the way back.

</details>

**主持人**: 原住民的意思是？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And indigenous means

**保罗**: 原住民意味着他的家人来自丛林。他们的遗产、血统可以追溯到很久以前，他们是丛林人。他们来自**Seaha部落**。所以他的父亲，**唐·圣地亚哥**，他们知道药用植物。他们知道如何捕食**食人鱼**。他可以从脚上切下一块老茧，把它放在鱼钩上，用自己作诱饵来钓鱼。他可以捣碎**巴尔巴斯科**根，把它放进溪流里，然后所有的鱼都会浮到水面。他可以追踪鹿。他可以追踪美洲豹。他可以追踪一个人。所以这些人对森林了如指掌，他们就是我最初接触的人。因为我懂蛇，他懂一切。他懂森林的一切，药材、动物的习性、生态系统。我唯一懂的就是我说：“我懂怎么处理蛇。”他说：“我怕蛇。”我说：“我可以教你蛇。”我说：“你教我其他的一切。”他说：“你喜欢蛇？那跟我们来。”他说：“我们每年都会进行一次家庭狩猎之旅，深入丛林10天，那里除了拥有原住民身份的人，其他人都不允许进入。”他说：“你是我们的客人，你跟我们来。”于是我就这样沿着河流，进入了世界上尚未命名的地方，亚马逊雨林最原始的地区，通过经验向这些人学习如何在河里捕鱼，如何在风暴来临时穿越河流的困难部分，以及如何在风暴中生存。然后我们发现了**森蚺**。所以，我就是这样以一种非常非常规的方式接受训练并进入丛林的。亚马逊雨林有多大？我试图理解它的规模。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: indigenous means his family is from the jungle. Their heritage, their lineage going back, they are jungle people. They're from the Seaha tribe. And so his father, Don Santiago, there they knew the medicinal plants. They knew how to fish for piranha. Then he can cut a piece of callus off of his foot and put it on a hook using himself as bait to catch a bait fish. He can mash up a barbasco route and put it in a stream and then all the fish float to the surface. He can track a deer. He could track a jaguar. He could track a person. So these people know everything about the forest and they're the people that I came in with. And because I knew about snakes, he knew every He knew everything about the forest, the medicines, the habits of the animals, the systems. The only thing I knew was I said, "I know how to handle snakes." And he said, "I'm scared of snakes." And I said, "I could teach you snakes." I said, "You teach me everything else." And he goes, "You like snakes?" He goes, "Come with us." He said, "We go on a family hunting trip once a year where we go on this expedition 10 days into the jungle where no one's allowed to go, only people with indigenous status." He said, "You're our guest. You come with us." And so there I was going up the river into parts of the world that have yet to be named into the wildest places in the Amazon rainforest and learning from these guys through experience how to catch fish out of the river, how to navigate through difficult parts of the of the stream when the storms are coming, how to survive them. And then we found anacondas. And so it was like this I had this very very in unorthodox training and introduction into the jungle. How big is the Amazon rainforest? Trying to get my head around the scale of it.

</details>

**保罗**: 我不擅长数字。但我知道它比美国本土48个州加起来还要大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: I'm bad with numbers. What I do know is that it's larger than the lower 48 states.

</details>

**主持人**: 哇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Wow.

</details>

**保罗**: 它绝对是巨大的。它是地球上最大的连片雨林。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: It's it's absolutely tremendous. It's the largest contiguous rainforest on Earth.

</details>

**主持人**: 有些地方是人类从未涉足过的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And are there parts of it that people have never been to?

</details>

**保罗**: 百分之百有。亚马逊雨林中仍有未被探索的区域。有些亚马逊雨林的地方是人类从未涉足过的。如果你想彻底震撼自己的思想，亚马逊雨林的冠层大约在我们头顶150到160英尺高，非常高。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: 100%. There are still parts of the Amazon rainforest that are unexplored. There's parts of the Amazon rainforest that no one's ever been to. And if you really want to blow your own mind, the canopy of the Amazon rainforest is about 150 160 ft up above our heads, which is far.

</details>

**主持人**: 雨林中一半的生命存在于冠层。所以你谈论的是有史以来生物多样性最丰富的生物群落。地球上没有任何地方比亚马逊雨林拥有更多的陆生野生动物。而现在，在整个化石记录中，我们正处于亚马逊雨林的顶峰，这个生态系统的巅峰群落。它就是如此辉煌。安第斯山脉、雨林、云雾森林与低地热带亚马逊交汇的地方，那就是我们所知的整个宇宙中生命最丰富的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And half of the life in a rainforest exists in the canopy. So you're talking about the most mega biodiverse biome that has ever existed. There's never been more terrestrial wildlife anywhere on Earth than in the Amazon rainforest. And right now in the entire fossil record, we we're at the apex, the climax community of the Amazon rainforest. It's that brilliant. Where the Andes, rainforest, cloud forests meet the lowland tropical Amazon. There it is. That's the most life we know of in the entire universe.

</details>

**主持人**: 谈到人类生命。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And in terms of human life,

</details>

**保罗**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Mhm.

</details>

**主持人**: 我听说那里有很多我们从未接触过的人类生命。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I hear there's lots of human life there that we've never contacted.

</details>

**保罗**: 在**亚马逊西部**有各种各样的部落。有**Seaha部落**、**Machenga部落**和**Yin部落**。在这些部落之外，一直有关于**未接触部落**的传闻。在我最初在那里的许多年里，总会有人，比如某个叔叔、某个兄弟、某个表亲，带着这些疯狂的故事回来，说有人见过这些部落，他们身材高大、赤身裸体，仍然用弓箭狩猎。然后时不时地，会有人带着一支七英尺长的箭回来，那是一种竹制尖头的矛，巨大的竹尖，像砍刀一样锋利。那曾是我们证明他们存在的唯一证据，直到我们遇到他们的那一天。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: There are various tribes living through the Western Amazon. And you have the Seaha and the Machenga and you have the Yin and and then further out beyond all of these there were always rumors that there were uncontacted tribes and and for the first many years that I was there, it was always someone's uncle, someone's brother, someone's cousin would would come back with these crazy stories that someone had seen the tribes and that they were that they were tall and naked and they still hunted with bows and arrows and they would and then every now and And somebody would come back with a 7ft arrow, a spear tipped with bamboo, huge bamboo tip this big, razor sharp, like a machete. And that was the only proof we had that they existed until the day we met them.

</details>

**主持人**: 你是什么时候第一次见到他们的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: When did you meet them for the first time?

</details>

**保罗**: 为了解释我们是如何遇到他们的，我们可能应该先解释一下我们是如何走到那一步的，以及那个18岁的研究员是如何成为一个主要组织的董事的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: So, in order to explain how we met them, we should probably explain why what where we got to in how the how the 18-year-old researcher became the director of of of a major organization. But,

### 亚马逊的毁灭与守护者的诞生

**保罗**: 好的。在亚马逊的这些探险中，我与原住民的关系越来越密切。**JJ**作为我的老师，一直告诉我，我的书的第一章就是关于他教我的这种令人难以置信的相互关联性。我写到过这样一个时刻，他指着海滩对我说：“看看这个海滩，告诉我新闻。”我说：“什么？”他说：“是的。他说，每天的地面就像昨晚的报纸，它告诉你发生了什么。”于是我看着海滩，上面有**美洲豹**的足迹，还有一堆美洲豹的粪便，我完全不明白。他说：“这是它昨天来喝水的地方。那是它排便的地方。这是它今天来喝水的地方，你可以看到新的足迹。”然后他说：“你没注意到的是，你没看到我们头顶上的**秃鹫**。”我抬头一看，果然有秃鹫。他说：“注意它们没有看我们，它们在看美洲豹。”所以它们朝那个方向看。美洲豹刚捕杀了一只鹿，一直在吃，然后来河边喝水。所以他能破译所有这些不可思议的事情。他带着我穿越这些蝴蝶和相互关联的物种的世界，雨林上空流淌着一条雾河，这简直是地球上的**阿凡达**。然后，他们把它烧毁了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Okay. Well, some somewhere along the way as we as we as we did these expeditions through the Amazon and I became closer and closer with the indigenous people, you know, JJ as a teacher kept telling me and that's and that's what the the first chapter of the book is about is, you know, him just teaching me the incredible interconnectedness. There's this there's this moment that I write about where he's going, "Look at this beach and tell me the news." And I said, "What?" And he said, "Yeah." He said, "Every day the ground is like last night's newspaper. It tells you what happened." So, I look at the beach and there's jaguar tracks and there's like a mess of jaguar tracks and some Jaguar scat and I made no sense of it. And he was like, "This is where she came yesterday to drink. That's where she pooped. This is where she came today to drink. You can see the newer tracks." And then he's like, "And what you didn't notice, you didn't see the vultures above us." And I look up and there's vultures above us. And he goes, "Notice they're not looking at us. They're looking at the jaguar." And so they're looking that way. Jaguar had a fresh deer kill. and had continually been eating and then coming to the river to drink. And so he can decipher all of these incredible things. And so as he's taking me through these worlds of butterflies and interconnected species where there's a mist river flowing over the rainforest, this this avatar on Earth and then we then they burned it down.

</details>

**主持人**: 谁烧的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Who burned it down?

</details>

**保罗**: 伐木工人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: The loggers.

</details>

**保罗**: 所以我第一次看到古老的森林，一个我深爱的地方，那里的树木比这个房间大得多，就这样消失了。生命嘈杂，就像一场交响乐，亚马逊早晨尤其如此，生命交响曲般的轰鸣。然后到了晚上，有夜间合唱。当你听到这一切归于沉寂时，那是一种最可怕的经历，因为我们所爱的地方，矗立了千年的树木，科学从未描述过的物种，都被焚烧殆尽。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And so the first time I saw ancient forest, a place that I love with trees significantly bigger than this room, vanished. There's this cacophony of life, this orchestra, this symphonic roar of life that you get in the mo, especially in the morning in the Amazon. And then at night, there's the night chorus. And when you hear that silenced, it's one of the most horrific things that you can experience because places that we loved, trees that had been standing for a thousand years, species that had never been described by science were all incinerated.

</details>

**保罗**: 我对**JJ**说：“我们怎么能允许这种事发生？这不可能被允许。”我说：“难道没有我们可以打电话求助的人吗？”我们当时站在河边，他向前倾身，向这边看看，又向那边看看，然后说：“你看到任何人了吗？”他说：“因为我没看到任何人。”他说：“你必须做点什么。”我说：“我必须做点什么？”我说：“我才19、20岁。”我说：“我能做什么？我没有博士学位，没有信托基金，没有媒体影响力，我什么都没有。”我只有一把砍刀和赤脚。我们都有砍刀和赤脚。所以这就是旅程的开始，我们说：“我们所爱的东西正在被摧毁。”我们能看到地平线上的烟雾。我们曾探索并爱上的树木，正冒着烟躺在我们面前的地上。我们说：“好吧，现在我们必须找到一种方法来改变这种叙事。地球上最原始的地方即将被摧毁、推平、烧毁。我们如何拯救它？”所以，当你问丛林生活如何转化为你的听众会觉得有趣的问题时，答案就是承担一项如此巨大的任务，以至于在开始时，我们甚至无法构想，即使有合适的工具，这怎么可能实现。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And I said to JJ, I said, "How do we this this this can't be allowed? This can't this can't possibly be something that's permitted." And I said, "Isn't there somebody that we can call?" We were standing on the side of the river, and he he leaned forward. And he looked this way and he looked that way and he goes, "Do you see anybody?" He goes, "Cuz I don't see anybody." He goes, "You have to do something." I said, "I have to do something." I said, "I'm 19, 20 years old." I said, "What am I going to do?" I said, "I don't have a PhD. I don't have a trust fund. I don't have a media presence. I don't have anything." I had a machete and I had bare feet. We both had machetes and bare feet. And so that was the start of the journey where we said, "The thing we love is being destroyed." We could see the smoke on the horizon. The trees that we had explored and become to love were laying smoldering on the ground in front of us. And we said, "Okay, now we have to figure out a way to change the narrative. The wildest place on earth is about to be destroyed, bulldozed, and burned. How do we save it?" And so that's where when you ask the question of how does life in the jungle sort of translate to what your listeners are going to find interesting, it's taking on a task that's so gigantic that at the start of it, we couldn't even come up with we couldn't even conceptualize how it could be possible even with the right tools

</details>

**主持人**: 拯救亚马逊。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: to save the Amazon

</details>

**保罗**: 拯救亚马逊雨林，更不用说两个没有任何资格、赤脚拿着砍刀的家伙了。所以我们从零开始，而今天我们已经把伐木工人和淘金工人变成了**环保巡护员**。我们正在保护13万英亩的河流。我们即将创建一座**国家公园**。我和**JJ**是**Jungle Keepers**的董事，我们即将创造历史，因为我们将拯救整个流域以及所有剩余的树木、动物和生命。这就是我试图讲述的故事。这就是我存在的全部理由。这就是我每天醒来所做的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: to save the Amazon rainforest, let alone for two guys with zero qualifications, bare feet and machetes. And so we started behind zero and today we're at the point where we've turned loggers and gold miners into conservation rangers. We're protecting 130,000 acres of the river. We're on the cusp of creating a national park. Me and JJ are the directors of Jungle Keepers and we're about to make history because we're going to save the entire watershed and all the trees and animals and heartbeats that are left. And that's the story that I'm trying to tell. That's the whole reason for my existence. That's why I that's what I wake up and do every day.

</details>

**主持人**: 你真的以一种非常个人化的方式承担了这份责任。我能看出来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And you've really taken on that responsibility in a very personal way. I can tell.

</details>

**保罗**: 是的，是的。有那么一个时刻，我记得，我出生在**布鲁克林**，然后我在**泽西**长大了一段时间，后来我们搬到了**哈德逊河谷**。但是当你开始每年在亚马逊待上好几个月，带着伤疤和故事回来，比如美洲豹在你脖子上呼吸，你独自外出探险，然后回来，突然间在烧烤派对上与人交谈的感觉就不同了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Yeah. Yeah. There's a there's a point where, you know, I remember cuz you grow up I was born in Brooklyn and then we you know, I grew up in Jersey for a while and then we moved to the Hudson Valley. But when you start you start going to the Amazon for months and months and months out of the year and you come back with scars and stories where a jaguar is breathing on your neck and you you go out on a solo and you come back and then suddenly standing and making conversation at a barbecue feels different.

</details>

**保罗**: 这几乎就像，我有很多退伍军人朋友，你几乎会对行动上瘾，然后你也会对团队上瘾。**塞巴斯蒂安·荣格**写过关于这种对社区、部落和使命的渴望。我认为这是当今人们所缺失的一点，他们不知道，我们已经与宗教、社区以及与其他人直接的联系脱节了。那么，还有什么呢？你如何，你的存在意味着什么？你的目的是什么？你每天醒来做什么？所以我想，在过去，我们必须保护自己免受外部世界的侵害，免受交战社区的侵害，或者仅仅是为家人提供食物。我们每天必须取水，每天必须砍柴，我们必须想办法生存。而现在，当我在城市里时，我醒来会想：“冰箱里有水，所以我不用去取水。”我会想：“空调开着，我猜我会看看手机。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: It's it's almost like I imagine I have a lot of veteran friends and sort of you you almost get addicted to the action and then you also get addicted to the the the the team, you know. Uh Sebastian Younger writes about this about the the addict the the the the need for community the tribe and sort of the the mission and I think that that's one thing that people are missing today where they they they don't know you know we've been disassociated from religion and community and and and immediate sort of connection with other humans. And so then well then what else is there? How do how do you where where to what do you more your existence? What do you what's your what's your purpose? What do you wake up and do every day? And so I think, you know, in the old days it was like, you know, we have to we have to defend ourselves from the outside world, from waring communities, you know, or even just providing for your family. We have to bring water every day. We have to chop wood every day. We have to figure out how to survive. And like today, I mean, when I'm here, I wake up and I go, "Well, there's there's water in the fridge, so I don't have to do that." And I'm like, "The air conditioner is on and the I'm like, I guess I'll check my phone, you know."

</details>

**保罗**: 所以，我想我们，就像你说的，我们已经某种程度上偏离了我们被设计成的样子。当你进入野外时，一件美好的事情会发生，任何野外都会如此，那就是它会开始改变你。你进入野外，开始捡起木头并扔出去。你开始劈柴，第一天你的手会起老茧，但几周后，你的手就会变得粗糙。你开始赤脚走路，也是一样。太阳会使你的皮肤变厚、晒黑、更有弹性，然后雨水会进一步强化这一点。你的眼睛会变得更锐利，你会更注意你听到的声音。所以你会经历一场全面的转变，你几乎会变成另一种动物。你变成了丛林版的自己，你变成了山地版的自己。你的腿会再次变得强壮。所以，野外会让你经历一场磨砺般的转变，你变得与环境相连。然后那种疏离感就会有所缓解。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And so I, you know, I think we have, like you said, become somehow we've gone really far away from what we are built for. And one of the beautiful things that happens when you go into the wild, and this can be any wild, is that it starts to change you. And so you go into the wild and you start picking up logs and throwing them. You start splitting firewood, and the first day you're going to have calluses on your hands, but then after a few weeks, you're going to have tough hands. You start walking barefoot, same thing. The sun starts to make your skin thicker and tanner and more resilient and then the rain will hammer that home and you start to get your eyes start to get sharper and you start to pay more attention to what you're hearing. And so you start going through this whole transformation where you start to be almost become a different animal. You become the jungle version of yourself. You become the mountain version of yourself. Your legs start to get strong again. And so so the wild puts you through this gauntlet of transformation and you become connected to your environment. And then that feeling of disassociation tends to alleviate a little bit.

### 大脑的转变与罗斯福的启示

**主持人**: 我听说大脑的某个特定部分也会发生变化。你提到了转变。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I heard about this particular part of the brain that changes as well. You talked about transformation.

</details>

**保罗**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 他们在几年前发现了一个叫做**前扣带皮层**的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Um they discovered something not so many years ago called the anterior midsulate cortex.

</details>

**保罗**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Mhm.

</details>

**主持人**: 我听**安德鲁·休伯曼**说，他认为这是过去一个世纪神经科学最重要的发现之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Andrew Hubman and I heard him say that he thinks it was one of the most important discoveries in neuroscience of the last century.

</details>

**主持人**: **前扣带皮层**是大脑中位于你的情感脑和执行控制中心之间的一部分，当你做困难的事情时，它会生长。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: The anterior mid-s singular cortex is a part of the brain sitting between your emotional brain and your executive control center that essentially grows when you do hard things.

</details>

**主持人**: 不是当你做那些你喜欢做的事情时，而是当你做那些你不想做但仍然去做的事情时。所以不是因为你喜欢跑步而跑马拉松。是你不想做但仍然去做的事情。我看到的一些研究说，那些被带入这种“末日滚动”一代的年轻人，他们的大脑这部分更小。如果你肥胖，它也更小。运动员的更大，活得更久的人的更大。他们把它称为大脑的“肌肉”，是做困难事情的肌肉。所以当你谈到那种身体上的转变时，我奇怪地想到了**罗斯福**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Not when you do things that um specifically when you do things that you don't want to do but you do them anyway. So not running a marathon because you enjoy it. Things you don't want to do and you do it anyway. And it went through some of the studies I saw said that younger people that have been brought into this sort of doom scrolling generation have smaller ones. If you are um obese, it's smaller. Um athletes have bigger ones and people who live longer have even bigger ones. And it's they kind of call it like the muscle of the brain of doing hard things. And so when you were talking about that physical transformation, I weirdly thought about I think it was Roosevelt who

</details>

**主持人**: 在同一天失去了母亲和妻子之后。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: after losing his mom and his wife on the same day.

</details>

**保罗**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Yes.

</details>

**主持人**: 在他的小女儿出生后，他去了**恶地**，花了两年时间做你所说的那些事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: After his baby girl was born, he went out to the Badlands and spent two years doing pretty much what you said,

</details>

**主持人**: 故意让自己处于不适之中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: putting himself in intentional discomfort.

</details>

**保罗**: 是的。他回来后，所有的朋友都说他变了。他后来成为了美国历史上最年轻的总统。他中枪后仍然坚持演讲。他领导了**西班牙十字军**或**西班牙战争**的冲锋。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Yeah. and he came back and all of his friends described him as being transformed. He went on to become the youngest president in American history. He got shot and carried on doing the speech. He led the charge um uh I think it was the Spanish crusades or something like the Spanish war.

</details>

**主持人**: 还有**“莽骑兵”**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And the Rough Riders.

</details>

**保罗**: 是的，“莽骑兵”。他们都指出，他去恶地的那一刻，塑造了他成为一个完全不同的人。那种不适。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Yeah, the Rough Riders. And they all pointed at the moment when he went out to the Badlands. They said it shaped him into becoming a completely different man. That that discomfort.

</details>

**保罗**: 是的，百分之百。这就是为什么**美洲原住民文化**在年轻男子成人礼时会有“幻象探索”，他们会把年轻人送到荒野中。现在仍然有各种不同的类型。**澳大利亚原住民文化**也有类似的事情。我也想让自己经历这些。所以我去了，那是我在第一本书中描述的，**JJ**教会了我如何在丛林中生存。然后我开始独自进行10天的探险，去那些有名字的最后一个地方。我说的是偷猎者。然后我开始徒步，深入亚马逊雨林，直到我脱离地图，我会在那里尝试生存。所以我经历了很多本不该活下来的冒险。但对我来说，让自己经历这些非常重要，因为我从小就伴随着那种不适感长大。我从小就伴随着那种被告知“末日将至”的巨大压力。我是说，我在**布朗克斯动物园**看到过，他们说：“我们的雨林正在消失。”他们播放着电锯的声音，你看到树木倒下。他们说：“我们正在失去大象。”你会看到有人开枪，大象倒下。他们只是说，对我来说，你所爱的一切都在被摧毁，很快我们就无法饮水，一切都会被污染，我们的渔业正在被破坏。我说：“等等，等等。我说，我必须知道情况是否真的那么糟糕。”所以当我长大后，我不仅仅是被激励去执行任务。我想要亲自去发现，因为我不喜欢通过屏幕了解信息。我不希望别人过滤我的信息。我想要亲自去发现。真的有那么糟糕吗？所以我踏上了一段探索之旅，去了解现实是什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Yeah, 100%. And and that's that's why Native American cultures for the initiation of their young men would have vision quests where they would send them out into the wilderness. And there's still different there's all different types. Aboriginal cultures have similar things. And I wanted to put myself through that. And so I went out on that's what I described in my first book is going out on that's where JJ taught me enough to survive in the jungle. And then I started going out on 10day solos into place. I'd have people bring me to the last place that had a name. Like I'm talking about poachers. And then I would start hiking and I would go so deep in the Amazon rainforest that I was just off the map and I would try and survive out there. And so I had a lot of adventures that I should not have survived. But it was very important to me to put myself through that because I grew up with that discomfort. I grew up with the overwhelming crushing stress of being told that we're at the end of days. We are losing I mean I saw it at the Bronx Zoo. They said, you know, we're losing our rainforests. And they had the sound of the chainsaws and you see the trees going over and they said we're losing elephants. You'd see somebody shoot and the elephant goes over and they just said everything that you for me everything you love is being destroyed and pretty soon we're not going to be able to drink and everything's going to be polluted and our fisheries are being destroyed. And I said wait so wait a second. I said I have to know if it's really that bad. So when I got old enough don't it's not just that I was inspired to go out on a mission. And it was that I wanted to find out for myself cuz I'm I don't like finding out through a screen. I don't I don't want other people filtering my information. I wanted to find out for myself. Is it really that bad? And so I was going out on a quest to understand what the reality was.

### 20年间的转变：从冒险到责任

**主持人**: 如果我把18岁的你和现在38岁的你放在这张桌子旁，20年的时间差。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: If I sat 18-year-old you at this table, he sat there and you know this version of you at what 37 38 38 you were sat there. So 20 years difference.

</details>

**主持人**: 这两个人之间会有什么显著的区别？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What would the notable differences be between these two men?

</details>

**保罗**: 嗯，他那时还不知道怎么用脚捕鱼，这是肯定的。他的砍刀技术会很糟糕。但最显著的区别是，那个18岁的我，他最大的梦想是减轻他从小承受的环境压力，逃离规则的世界，在生活中找到目标，并仅仅是为了冒险。我最大的梦想是看到亚马逊雨林。我看着像**泰迪·罗斯福**和**珍·古道尔**这样的人，我说：“天哪，他们过着如此非凡的生活。”我说：“为什么我的生活不能那样？我在这里被留校察看。”你知道，我在这里被告知没有完成作业。我想：“我想要砍柴挑水。我想要去打仗。我想要感到恐惧。我想要接受挑战。”所以对我来说，那时的我渴望所有这些。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Um, well, he didn't know how to fish with his feet. Um, that's for sure. His machete skills would be terrible. But the the noticeable difference would be that that 18-year-old, his greatest dream was to alleviate the environmental stress that he grew up with, escape the world of rules, find purpose in life, and to just have adventures. My my greatest dream was to see the Amazon rainforest. I looked at people like Teddy Roosevelt and Jane Goodall and I said, "Man, they had such incredibly like extraordinary lives." And I said, "How come my life can't be like that? I'm over here in detention." You know, I'm over here being told I didn't do my homework. And I'm like, "I want to chop wood and carry water. I want to go to war. I want to be scared. I want to be challenged." And so for me it was I I was that would be the difference is that I would be hungry for all of that.

**保罗**: 而今天坐在你对面的这个人，我的身体就像一幅**杰克逊·波洛克**的画，布满了伤疤：鳄鱼咬伤、老虎咬伤、感染，还有几次差点被大象压死。我曾被**贩毒恐怖分子**追捕。而现在，那个孩子想看到的一切都看到了。我们找到了最大的**森蚺**。我经历了那些惊人的冒险，这很棒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Whereas the person sitting across from you today, my body is a Jackson Pollock painting of scars, crocodile bites, tiger bites, infections, times that I've been almost crushed to death by elephants. I've been hunted by the narot terrorists. And at this point, the responsibility at that kid got to see all the things he wanted to see. We found the biggest anacondas. I lived through the amazing adventures and that's great.

</details>

**保罗**: 今天坐在你对面的这个人，肩负着保护数百万动物生命的责任。我的工作是向人们解释，每一个阅读或聆听这条信息的人，都有机会在亚马逊永远消失之前，帮助原住民拯救它。所以主要的区别在于，那个年纪的我只是想要一些**冒险故事**，而现在我发现冒险变成了意义。我一路走来找到了它。现在我踏上了另一段旅程。现在是“我们能把它带回家吗？”现在是“我们能否实现我们认为不可能的事情，并改变它的完成方式？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: The person sitting across from you today is responsible for protecting millions of animal lives. And my job is to explain to people that we that everyone reading this message or listening to this message has the chance to help the indigenous people save the Amazon before we lose it forever. And so that's the main difference is that at that age I was just I just wanted some swashbuckling adventure. And now I found that adventure became meaning. I found it along the way. And then now I'm on a whole other journey. Now it's now it's can we bring it home? Now it's can we achieve something that we thought was impossible and change the narrative of how it's done.

</details>

**主持人**: 我想这又把我们带回了关于未接触部落的问题。你说你和**JJ**讨论过如何拯救亚马逊。突出亚马逊的未接触部落是任务的一部分吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And I guess this kind of brings us back to this question about the unconted tribes. You said you and JJ were talking about how you might go about saving the Amazon. Was highlighting the unconted tribes in the Amazon part of the mission there?

</details>

**保罗**: 不。非常不是。这是个好问题，因为我们开始做的是，我们看着这个河流盆地，然后说：“好吧，我们爱这条真正原始的河流，现在我们说，为什么这条河流如此原始？”你知道，你可以把亚马逊想象成一条河流之树。你有亚马逊主河道，然后是数百万条支流。所以亚马逊上游，亚马逊雨林最顶端的支流，人们现在才刚刚到达那里。你知道，亚马逊主河道是一个航运港口，然后有巨大的支流从它分出去。你可以乘坐蒸汽船一直深入到**伊基托斯**。你可以一路穿过**巴西**数千英里，一直到达秘鲁的伊基托斯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: No. Very much no. That's a great question because what we started doing was we looked at this river basin and we said, "Okay, we we we love this this one really wild river and now we said why why has this river been so wild?" You know, so you think of the Amazon as a tree of rivers. You have the main Amazon channel and then all these millions of branches. And so the upper Amazon, the uppermost branches of the Amazon rainforest, those tip tip tops, people are only just getting to them now. You know, the main Amazon channel is a shipping port and then you have these huge tributaries going off of it. And you can get in as far as Aquitos with a steam ship. Like you can go all the way through Brazil thousands of miles and get all the way to Aikitos, Peru

</details>

**主持人**: 几乎是亚马逊的尽头。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: to the almost the back end of the Amazon.

</details>

**保罗**: 我去过那里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: I've been there.

</details>

**主持人**: 而且很美。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And and it's beautiful.

</details>

**保罗**: 我们在南边的支流边缘。有一条支流。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: We are at the southern edge in the tributaries down there. There's one tributary.

</details>

**主持人**: 什么是支流？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What's a tributary?

</details>

**保罗**: 支流是主河道的分支。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: A tributary is is an offshoot from a larger river.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以一条小溪是一条更大溪流的支流，然后这条溪流最终汇入**哈德逊河**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So a stream is a tributary of a larger stream which goes into, you know, then eventually you reach the Hudson River.

</details>

**保罗**: 所以这是一条很小的支流。我们发现，人们没有开发这条支流的原因，以及其他原住民社区没有形成的原因，是因为几百年来，这条特殊的河流一直受到暴力、神秘的**马什科皮罗**游牧未接触部落的保护。这使得它保持了原始状态。他们是最初的丛林守护者，但当我到达那里时，这只是一种神话。所以他们被认为是生活在河流上游很远的地方，超过了最后一个原住民社区。当我提到原住民社区时，我指的是我们可以交谈的人，我们可以与他们互动，我可以说一点西班牙语，他们也能理解我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And so this is a tiny little tributary. And the we what we discovered is that the reason people hadn't developed this tributary, the reason other indigenous communities hadn't formed was that for hundreds and hundreds of years, this particular river had been protected by the violent, mysterious, Mashkopiro, nomadic, uncontacted tribes. And that had kept it wild. They were the original jungle keepers, but by the time I got there, there was sort of just a myth. And so they were something that they said they lived really far up river past the last indigenous community. And I when I say indigenous community I mean people that we can talk to, people that we can interface with that I can speak a little Spanish to and they'll understand me.

</details>

**主持人**: 我认为这是一个重要的区别。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I think that's an important distinction.

</details>

**保罗**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Yes.

</details>

**主持人**: 你能区分原住民和这些部落吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Because can you make that distinction between indigenous and these tribes?

</details>

**保罗**: 是的。在秘鲁，有**利马**，有米其林星级餐厅和各种美食，然后你前往**库斯科**，那里有**马丘比丘**和**安第斯山脉**，以及所有令人惊叹的文化。然后你进入丛林，这有点像去**阿拉斯加**的偏远地区。就像你离**洛杉矶**或**纽约**很远，但仍然是同一个国家。在那里你会遇到这些原住民社区。所以在我们**Jungle Keepers**目前保护的保护区里，有两个原住民社区。我们与他们合作，为他们提供支持，因为当这些伐木工人、**贩毒者**和**淘金者**进来时，他们把这些原住民看作目标。他们会进来，说：“哦，这些无助的原住民，我们怎么能剥削他们？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Yes. So within Peru, you have Lima and and you know Michelin star restaurants and all this amazing food and then you travel down to Cusco where you have Machu Picchu and you have the Andes and all of that incredible culture and then you go down to the jungle and it's a little bit like going to the back end of Alaska. That's where it's like you are very far away from LA or New York like but it's the same country and out there you'll reach these communities where they are indigenous and so in the reserve that we currently protect as jungle keepers there's two indigenous communities there and we work with them to sort of support them because as these loggers and narot traffickers and gold miners come in they see them as as a mark they'll go in and say oh there's these helpless indigenous people how can we exploit them

</details>

**主持人**: 我们怎么能得到他们的树木、他们的鱼？他们会去拿走这些东西，或者卖给他们不值钱的东西。所以我们一直在与这些原住民社区合作，问他们：“你们想让伐木工人进来砍掉你们所有的树吗？”他们说：“不想。”他们又说：“但同时，我们需要一点汽油，因为如果我们要生孩子，我们必须把女儿送到镇上的医院怎么办？”所以我们一直在与他们合作，为他们提供可持续的**巡护员**工作，保护他们自己的土地。这是一个非常简单的解决方案，否则他们就会去做伐木工人来赚钱。所以我们一直在与这些社区合作，现在他们是巡护员、船夫、向导和杂工。大约一年前，他们给我们打电话说，有件不可思议的事情正在发生，会很危险，但你们是董事，你们是这个家庭的一部分，你们是这个故事的一部分，我们需要你们在这里，因为部落即将走出森林。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: how can we get their trees, their fish, they'll go and take those things from them or they'll or they'll sell them something that's not worth what what they think it is. And so we've been working with these indigenous communities to say, "Do you want the loggers to come in and cut down all of your trees?" And they go, "No." And they go, "But at the same time, we need a little bit of gasoline because what if we're having a baby and we have to get our daughter to a hospital in town?" And so we've been working with them to provide sustainable jobs as rangers protecting their own land. And it's such a simple solution whereas otherwise they would go and be loggers to get that cash. And so we were working with these communities and now they're rangers and boat drivers and guides and handymen. And they called us about a year ago and they said something incredible is happening and it's going to be dangerous, but you are the directors and you're part of this family and you're part of this story and we need you here for this, but the tribes are about to come out of the forest.

</details>

**保罗**: 我们当时在镇上，我们现在做的是，我们筹集资金，然后把它带到亚马逊，当地人有机会划出大片亚马逊土地来保护它。我们正在改变破坏的叙事，我们在他们到来之前就保护它。所以我们当时和现在是这个主要组织的董事**JJ**在镇上，我们正在和我们的律师交谈，我们在办公室里，然后我们接到电话说部落出来了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And we were in town and where what you know what we do now is you know we and we can explain this later but we raise money and we bring it to the Amazon where we the local people have the opportunity to set aside huge acreage of of the Amazon to protect it. We're we're changing the narrative of destruction where we just protect it before they get to it. And so we were in town with JJ who's now the director of this major organization and we're talking to our lawyers and we're in the office and we get this call that the tribe is out.

</details>

**主持人**: 部落出来了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: The tribe is out.

</details>

**保罗**: 部落出来了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: The tribe is out.

</details>

**主持人**: 那是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What does that mean?

</details>

**保罗**: 这意味着那个神话般的未接触部落，当我到达秘鲁时，秘鲁总统曾说这些都是神话，他们不存在，那只是吓唬伐木工人的**妖怪**。所以他们的存在曾备受争议，几乎处于想象的边缘。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: It means the mythical unconted tribe that when I arrived in Peru, the president of Peru had been saying these are a myth. They don't exist and it's just it's the boogeyman. It's been made up as a story to scare the loggers. So, their existence was contested. They were almost on the fringes of imagination.

</details>

### 首次接触未接触部落

**主持人**: 我们不能派飞机飞过去吗？我知道这听起来像个蠢问题，但我们应该有卫星，可以放大看。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Could we not have flown a plane over there or something? Is that you know, this sounds like a dumb question, but presumably we have satellites and we can zoom in.

</details>

**保罗**: **BBC**确实做过一个节目，他们驾驶飞机，从几英里外观察一个未接触部落，他们说：“我们非常小心，不打扰他们，但在雨林中确实有一个与世隔绝的部落。”你可以看到这些人弯着腰，看着飞机，但飞机离得不够近，不足以真正吓到他们或给他们带来任何困扰。所以，我们确实做过。但在我们的河流上，在荒无人烟的地方，没有人听说过BBC。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: The BBC did do a piece where they were flying a plane and they were looking at an unconted tribe from miles away and they said, "We're being very careful not to disturb them, but there is a tribe in the rainforest that has no contact with the outside world." And you could see these people bending and they're looking at the plane, but the plane's not close enough to really scare them or to cause them any distress. And so, we have done that. But then on our river out in the middle of nowhere where no one's heard of the BBC,

</details>

**保罗**: 你只听到伐木工人从上游三周路程的地方传来的故事。你可以沿着河上溯三周，什么也遇不到。没有人烟。那就像是最后一片无尽的森林。所以当社区打电话说海滩上有箭，部落要出来了，这是10年来部落第一次似乎要走出丛林进行接触。所以他们把**Jungle Keepers**的董事们叫到了那里。我们必须赶过去。他们恳求我们去，这样我们就能亲眼看到，因为他们担心我们不相信他们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: you just hear stories from loggers who've come down river from three weeks up river. You can go for three weeks up the river and hit nothing. There's nothing human. It's like the last endless forest. And so when the community called and they said there's arrows on the beach, the tribe is coming out. It's the first time in 10 years that the tribe seems to be coming out of the jungle to make contact. And so they got they got the directors of Jungle Keepers up there. We had to we had to rush to be there. They begged us to be there so that we could see it because they were worried that we wouldn't believe them.

</details>

**保罗**: 于是我们到了那里，连夜赶路。当你在晚上逆流而上时，我们把两天的船程缩短到了一夜。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And so we got there and we went all night. And when you go up a river at night, we do a two-day boat journey in one night.

</details>

**保罗**: 照片上那个额头有伤疤的人就是**伊格纳西奥**。他额头上的伤疤是因为他在试图与未接触部落进行和平接触时，被一支7英尺长的箭射中了头部。他当时正试图送给他们一份礼物，但他们受惊了，害怕了，然后用箭射中了他的头部，他差点因此丧命。当我们听说这件事发生时，他现在是我们最好的**Jungle Keepers**巡护员之一。我们问他：“你能在一夜之间完成两天的船程吗？”他回答：“是的，先生。”他戴上头灯，坐到船尾，我们乘坐一艘敞篷独木舟，从晚上6点一直开到第二天早上9点，穿越了我见过的最糟糕的雷暴。我当时在船头，用手电筒照着河边的鳄鱼眼睛，**凯门鳄**的眼睛会发光，以此来导航，因为风暴太大了，我们什么也看不见。我们看不清河岸，而且由于光线照亮了雨滴，你甚至看不清前方。所以我们用鳄鱼的眼睛来导航，确定河岸的位置。我负责观察并告诉他往哪个方向走，他开了一整夜。我们到达了原住民社区，然后问：“好吧，发生了什么事？”他们说：“哦，他们走了。部落走了。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And so the guy right there, the picture with the guy who has the scar on his forehead, that's Ignasio. He that scar is because he was shot in the head by a 7-ft arrow while he was trying to make peaceful contact with the unconted tribes. He was trying to give them a gift and they got spooked and they scared and they shot him in the head and he almost died from that when we heard that this was happening and he's now one of our best jungle keepers rangers. We said, "Can you do a two-day boat journey in one night?" And he went, "Yes, sir." and he put on a headlamp and he got in the back of the boat and we took an open top canoe and we drove from 6:00 p.m. until 9:00 a.m. the next day through the worst thunderstorm I've ever seen. I was on the front of the boat with a flashlight using the crocodile eyes, the Cayman eyes on the side of the river to navigate cuz they shine. The eyes shine comes back. The the the storm was so bad that I we couldn't see anything. We couldn't see the side of the river and because of the light igniting the raindrops, you can't you can't even see what's in front of you. So we were using the the croc eyes to to navigate where the edges of the river was. So I was spotting and telling him which way to go and he drove and we did that all night long. Got to the indigenous community and said, "Okay, so what's going on?" And they said, "Oh yeah, they left. Tribe's gone."

</details>

**保罗**: 他们唯一知道的是，前一天有一个人被箭射中了。他当时正在钓鱼，看到了部落。他说：“他们用箭射了他。”他们做的第一件事就是用一支7英尺长的箭射他，箭击中船后反弹，然后击中了他厚厚的皮带，箭尖钝了，他把箭留了下来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: The only thing that they had was that one guy the previous day had been shot by an arrow and he had been fishing and he had seen the tribes. So he said, "And they had shot an arrow at him." The first thing they had done was shot one of these 7-ft arrows at him and the way it had hit the boat ricocheted and then hit his thick leather belt and blunted the tip of the arrow and he had the arrow.

</details>

**保罗**: 所以他说：“这里有人。”然后一位来自另一个地区的**原住民人类学家**出现了，他说：“他们称我为祖父。我能和这些人说话。我会说一点他们的语言。”所以我们又在丛林深处待了一晚，两天。第二天早上我们说：“好吧，我们离开这里。这里显然除了故事、脚印和箭之外什么都没有，我们还有重要的工作要在镇上做。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And so he says, "So there are there are people here." And then a native anthropologist from another region showed up and he said, "I they know me as the grandfather. I can speak to these people. I speak a little bit of their language." And so we stayed another night, two days deep in the jungle. And the following morning we said, "Okay, we're getting out of here. There's obviously nothing here but, you know, stories and footprints and arrows and we have important work to do back in town."

</details>

**主持人**: 你相信他们吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And did you believe them?

</details>

**保罗**: 在亚马逊工作，我学到了一件事：永远相信当地人。永远。如果他们说有，那就没错。这也是我能进行这些冒险的部分原因。**JJ**告诉我，有些地方非常原始，就像**加拉帕戈斯群岛**一样，动物们从未见过人类，但你必须徒步数天，到达河流的最上游才能找到。这就是我独自冒险的原因。所以我在书中写道，作为一名作家，我所做的就是试图带人们进行这些亚马逊探险。所以当他们说部落要来了时，被箭射中头部的**伊格纳西奥**说：“听我说。”他说：“你是我的老板，对吧？”我说：“是的。”他说：“我需要像朋友一样跟你说话。”我说：“说吧，说吧，说吧。”他说：“他们要来了。你现在离开就是个傻瓜。”所以我们守在那里，等着。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: I've learned one thing working in the Amazon. Always believe the locals. Always. There's there's if they say it's there, they're not wrong. And that's part of the reason that I've gotten to go on these adventures. You know, when JJ Tell told me there's places you can go that are so wild that it's like the Galopagos. the animals don't know a human, but you have to go for days on foot to the topmost reaches of the rivers to find this. Well, that's why I went on these these solos. And so I write that's what that's as a writer that's what I do is try and take people on these adventures through the Amazon. And so when they said the tribe is coming, Ignasio, the guy who'd been shot in the head, he said, "Listen to me." He said, "You're" He said, "You're my boss, right?" I said, "Yeah." He goes, "I need to speak to you like a friend." I said, "Speak, speak, speak." And he said, "They're coming. You'd be an idiot to leave." And so we posted up, we waited.

</details>

**主持人**: 他怎么知道的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How he knew?

</details>

**保罗**: 是的，我在想他怎么知道的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Yeah, I'm wondering how he knew.

</details>

**保罗**: 他就是知道，伙计。他们就是知道。他们能分辨出来。而且，这些人能通过鸟叫声判断附近是否有美洲豹。他们能在风暴来临之前就知道。他们拥有比我们更敏锐的感官。所以他说：“看，部落要来了。有箭。他们就在这个区域。”他说：“当他们靠得这么近时，通常是想说话。”我说：“但是这……”果然，你听到“莫斯科”的声音，然后所有人开始尖叫。那是一个极度恐慌的时刻，妇女们抱着婴儿，鸡飞狗跳，狗也在叫。我们身处一个河边的小原住民社区，周围是数百英里的丛林。我们跑到河边悬崖的边缘。河对面，我们看到他们朝我们走来。他们赤身裸体地走出丛林，腰间只系着一根绳子，生殖器向上绑在腹部。他们都拿着七英尺长的弓箭，弓着身子看着我们。我们站在那里，你就会想：“我本来想看看这个，但现在我不太确定我想待在这里了。”因为有来自一千年前的战士走出丛林。所以我问人类学家：“他们是石器时代的人吗？”他说：“他们没有石头。”他说：“他们仍然处于竹器时代。”他说：“这些人过着如此原始的生活方式。他们是狩猎采集者。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: He just knew, man. They just know. It's like they can they can tell. And then, you know, I mean, these are guys who know when there's a jaguar close by the sound of the birds. They know when a storm's coming before the storm is audible. You know, they they have higher tuned senses than we do. And and so he said, "Look, the tribe is coming. There's the arrow. They're in the region." And he goes, "And when they come this close, they generally they want to talk." And I said, "But this is" and sure enough, you hear Mosk go and everyone starts screaming. And it was just this moment of absolute panic where women were lifting babies and chickens are flying around and dogs and we're in this tiny little indigenous community on the side of a river with hundreds and hundreds of miles of jungle around. And we run to the edge of this, you know, the edge of the river where this cliff is. And across the river, we see them coming towards us. and they're walking out of the jungle and they're naked from head to toe. They just have some string tied around their waists, penises tied up to their bellies. They all have seven foot long bows and arrows and they're crouched over and they're looking at us and we're standing there and you go you sort of like you go I I just I I wanted I wanted to see this and now I'm not so sure I want to be here cuz there are warriors coming out of the jungle and they're from a thousand years ago. So I asked the anthropologist, I said, "They're like stone age people." And he goes, "They don't have stones." He said, "They're still in the bamboo age." He said, "These people are living such a primitive lifestyle. They're hunter gatherers.

</details>

**保罗**: 他们在丛林深处与世隔绝了几个世纪，就像一个时间胶囊。所以我们之间隔着一千年。我们站在河的两岸，中间隔着一千年。这是一个了解人类过去面貌的窗口。这些人拿着他们在丛林中制作的弓箭走出来，他们举起手，隔着河与我们交谈。这就像是“穿衣服的”与“赤裸的”之间的对话。我们只是两个部落，被一点水隔开，他们想交流。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And they've been isolated so deep in the jungle for so many centuries that it's like a time capsule. So there was a thousand years between us. We're standing on either side of the river with a thousand years between us. And this aperture into the history of what humankind used to look like. And these people came out holding their bows and arrows that they had made out of the jungle and they held up their hands and they were talking to us across a river. And it was sort of shirts versus skins. We were just two tribes separated by a little bit of water and they wanted to communicate.

</details>

**主持人**: 用什么语言？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: With what language?

</details>

**保罗**: 用他们的语言。我们甚至不知道该怎么称呼他们。有一段时间，他们被称为**马什卡皮罗人**，意思是“野生的皮罗人”。然后，最近，部分因为我们的这次接触，他们举起手，说的第一句话是“**No Mole**”。我们是兄弟。所以我们这边也说了同样的话。人类学家说“No Mole，兄弟们”。然后这种交流就开始了。这就像，我作为一个说西班牙语的人，在**意大利**时可以用西班牙语大致沟通意大利语。我觉得这就像那样，**Yin人**可以和**马什卡皮罗人**说话，这是一种近似的翻译。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: With their language. They I mean it's we don't even know really what to call them. For a while they were calling them the Mashkapiro, which means the wild piro people. And then um more more recently and partly because of our encounter they held up their hands and the first thing they said was no mole. We are the brothers. Brothers and so then our side said the same thing. The anthropologist said no mole brothers. And then this this this exchange began and it's like you know I as a Spanish speaker when I've been in Italy I can use my Spanish to kind of get through in in Italian. And I feel like it's like that the Yin people can speak to the Mashkapiro and it is an approximate translation.

</details>

**保罗**: 他们走出丛林，比文明晚了一千年，说的第一件事就是：“给我们香蕉。”他们说：“给我们食物。”他们要求我们提供芭蕉作为供品。我们这边说：“放下你们的武器。我们会和你们谈，但我们不希望以暴力收场。我们希望和平。如果你们想和我们说话，就放下你们的弓箭，因为霰弹枪能射多远？你知道，它甚至射不到100米，也许50米，散弹枪。而长弓的箭能射300米。它能射很远。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And the first thing that they said after coming out of the jungle a thousand years late to civilization was send us bananas. They said send us food. And they demanded that we send them plantains as an offering. And our side said you put down your weapons. We will talk to you but we do not want this to end violently. We want this to be peaceful. If you want to talk to us, put down your bow and arrows because a shotgun, a shotgun only goes how many meters? You know, it's not even going to go 100 meters, 50 m, maybe buckshot. A longbowow arrow is going to go 300 m. It's going to go far

</details>

**主持人**: 不用说，他们用箭很厉害。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: and they're needless to say, they're very good with those arrows.

</details>

**保罗**: 他们用箭非常厉害。这些箭会飞得很远。所以即使站在河的另一边，我们也不安全。所以我们都躲在树后面。我们看着。之前被射伤的**伊格纳西奥**用望远镜观察着。他说：“每当你看到他们走动时，他们会让你看到他们，然后他们会巧妙地把你引到森林里，那里有一个人在暗处观察你。”他会抓住我的肩膀说：“看，那里有一个。”你就会看到，森林的阴影中有一张涂着红色脸的脸。他会用弓瞄准我们。所以当他们中的一些人放下弓时，另一些人在阴影中确保他们仍然有支援。但我们要求前面的人放下箭。人类学家走进河里，给了他们香蕉作为供品。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: They are very good with those arrows. These things will fly. Um, and so even standing on the other side of the river, we were not safe. And so we were all standing behind trees. We were watching. Ignasio, who'd been shot before, was watching with the binoculars. And he's going, "Whenever you see them walking," he said, "they let you see them, and then they clever girl you in the forest where there's one watching you from the shadows." And he he would grab me by the shoulder and go, "Look, there's one." And you would just see this, you know, red face paint in the shadows of the forest. And he'd have the bow trained on us. And so while some of them in the front were putting the bows down, there was others of them in the shadows that were making sure that they still had support. But we asked the guys in the front to put down their arrows. The anthropologists got in the river and gave them an offering of bananas.

<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I'll let you um You know how to use an iPad, right?

</details>

**保罗**: 嗯，好了。是的。所以，这是早些时候的一个随机时刻，但这就是所有人开始尖叫“莫斯科！”我们都在跑的那个时刻。这就是我说的，他们正在海滩上移动。你可以看到他们使用的姿势。他们手里拿着弓箭，然后他们出现了，你看，他们在指着。他们担心我们的相机是枪，所以他们要求我们放下相机。他们对我们部落的各种成员感到好奇，他们都在同时说话，所以很难理解他们想要什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Um, there we go. Yeah. So, this is this was this is just a random moment from the earlier days, but this is that moment where everyone starts screaming, "Mosh, go and we're all running." And this is what I was talking about where they are moving across the beach. And you can see the sort of the posture they're using there. I mean, he's got they have their bows and arrows in hand and then they showed up and see they're pointing. They were worried that our cameras were guns and so they were asking to put down the cameras. They were curious about various members of our tribe and they were all talking at the same time and so it was very difficult to understand what they wanted.

</details>

**主持人**: 他用手指在做什么？他在做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What's he doing with his finger there? He's doing

</details>

**保罗**: 这个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: this.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**保罗**: 我不知道。这是我们给他们香蕉的时刻。令人难以忘怀的是，你看到他们脸上的绝望，他们都冲过去抢香蕉，他们不像是打算以后分享，他们抢香蕉就像是“我拿到我的香蕉，你拿到你的香蕉”。你看到这个了吗？他们都冲过去抢这小船的香蕉。这些人没有船。当他们这样做时，他们都在同时说话。就像一群鹦鹉。那简直是一片嘈杂声。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: I don't know. This is the moment that we gave them the bananas. And what's haunting about this is the desperation that you see on them where they're all rushing to get the bananas and they're not necessarily taking them like they're going to share later. They're taking them like I get my bananas, you get your bananas. You see this? They're all rushing to get this little boatload. And these are people that don't have boats. And as they're doing this, they're all talking at the same time. It was like a flock of parrots. It was just a cacophony of of sound.

</details>

**保罗**: 他们都在争抢这些芭蕉。然后一旦他们拿到，每个人都拿着自己的。他们有绳子和芭蕉。这次互动持续了几个小时。我们和他们进行了谈判。这只是我们目前被允许发布的片段。这是他们回到丛林中的画面。还有很多事情发生了。再次强调，这就是我们现在发布这些内容的原因。我应该说，这就是我们等了一段时间才发布这些片段的原因，因为这样的片段由于多种原因非常敏感。首先，你不想让人们认为我们去接触了这些想独处的人。你也不想鼓励其他人沉迷于他们的误解。人们会说：“哦，这些人是地球上最后自由的人，他们与大自然完美平衡地生活。”不，人们会去寻找他们。然而，几百年来，这些人只要求一件事，那就是独处。他们用箭来强制执行这一点，就像**科曼奇人**一样。而这一天，他们说：“请给我们食物。请给我们绳子。”他们还有一个问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And they're all fighting over these plantains. And and then once they get them, each person held their own. They have rope and plantains. And this interaction went on for several hours. And we negotiated with them. And this is just the footage. This is the footage that we're allowed to release right now. And this is them moving back off into the jungle. There's a lot more that happened. And again, that's where that's why that's why we're releasing this now. I should say that that's why we waited a while to release this footage because footage like this is incredibly sensitive for a number of reasons. A, you don't want people to think that we went out and contacted these people that want to be left alone. You also don't want to encourage other people to indulge their misconceptions. People go, "Oh, these are the last free people on earth. They live perfectly in balance with nature." No, people will go looking for them. Whereas, for hundreds of years, these people have asked for one thing and one thing only, to be left alone. And they've enforced that kind of like the Comanches with arrows. And on this day, they said, "Please give us food. Please give us us rope." And they had one other question.

</details>

**保罗**: 他们说：“我们怎么区分好人和坏人？”我们说：“你什么意思？谁是坏人？”他们说：“你们有些人用柔术，用火棍，用枪射我们。”我们当时想：“谁会那样做？”我们说：“我们不是坏人。”他们说：“不，你们也是。”他们说：“我们知道你们砍伐我们的树木。”他们是在对我们所有人说话。没有白人、棕色人、秘鲁人、外国人这些区别。只是你们这些外来者，停止砍伐我们的树木。我们的树木是我们的神。这就像是，你们不该那样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: They said, "How do we tell the bad guys from the good guys?" And we said, "What do you mean? Who are the bad guys?" And they said, "Some of you shooted us with the jiu-jitsu, with the fire sticks, the guns." And we were going, "Who who does that?" We said, "We are not the bad guys." And they said, "No, you also," they said, "We know you cut down our trees." They were speaking to all of us. It was not there's no like, you know, white guy, brown guy, Peruvian, foreigners, none of that. It was just all of you outsiders, stop cutting down our trees. Our trees are our gods. It was sort of like, you don't do that.

</details>

**保罗**: 就在几周前他们离开后，我们得知**贩毒者**视他们为威胁。实际上，发现了一个类似部落的乱葬岗。所以这些人正被**森林砍伐**围困，被**贩毒者**、**淘金者**和**伐木工人**追捕。所以我认为他们走出森林，是在说：“嘿，我们想了解一下外面世界发生了什么。谁是好人？谁是坏人？”他们不知道**Jungle Keepers**正在保护他们赖以生存的土地。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And then when they left just a few weeks ago, we learned that the narcot traffickers view them as a threat. And there was actually a mass grave found of a similar clan. And so these people are being boxed in by deforestation and hunted by narot traffickers and gold miners and loggers. And so I think that them coming out of the forest was their way of saying, "Hey, we're trying to get a read on what's going on in the outside world. Who is it? Who are the good guys? Who are the bad guys? They don't know that Jungle Keepers is protecting the land that they live on.

</details>

**保罗**: 他们从没听说过勺子、轮子、耶稣、第二次世界大战，甚至秘鲁这个国家。所以他们带着这么多问题走出来。而关心这些人，给予他们应得权利的唯一方式，就是保护他们赖以生存的森林。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: They've never heard of a spoon or the wheel or Jesus or World War II or the country of Peru. And so so they're coming out with so many questions. And the only way to care for these people and to give them the the the rights that they deserve is to protect the forest they live in.

</details>

**主持人**: 你知道他们中有些人为什么会摸鼻子吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Do you know why some of them seem to be touching their nose?

</details>

**保罗**: 有趣的是，我没有注意到。我想这会是你对人类学的发现。我确实没有注意到，但他们很多人都在这样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: It's funny. I didn't notice that. I think this is this is this is this is going to be your discovery to anthropology. I did not notice that, but it does. You see this a lot of them are doing this.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**保罗**: 还有他们的穿着。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And the the outfit um

</details>

**主持人**: 他们的穿着。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: the outfit

</details>

**主持人**: 这是什么穿着？看起来他们腰间系着绳子，生殖器露在外面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What is this outfit? This it looks like there's kind of rope tied around their midrift with their penises out.

</details>

**保罗**: 嗯，是的。生殖器的头部被绳子盖住了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Mhm. Yeah. The the the head of the penis is covered by rope.

</details>

**主持人**: 哦，他们把生殖器绑在绳子里了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Oh, they've got the penis up into the rope.

</details>

**保罗**: 不，生殖器的头部是向上并受到保护的。考虑到丛林里有蚊子、**马蝇**和**沙蝇**，这很合理。那是个聪明的举动。然后绳子似乎是，我的意思是，就像火、绳子、梯子一样，我认为这是人类的第二项发明。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: No, the head of the penis is up and protected. And and that makes sense given the jungle where there's mosquitoes and bot flies and sand flies. That that's a smart move. And then rope seems to be I mean what is it goes like fire rope ladders like I think it's like man's second invention.

</details>

**主持人**: 他们对绳子非常着迷。他们用绳子制作弓弦，制作箭。他们用绳子把东西绑在一起，制作他们有限的结构。我们对他们的一些了解是，我们会在他们离开后找到他们的营地。所以我们知道他们吃什么。他们主要吃乌龟和猴子。他们不捕鱼。他们没有鱼钩。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: They are obsessed with rope. That's how they make their bow strings. That's how they make their arrows. That's how they lash things together to make the the the limited structures that they make. And some of what we know about them is, you know, we find their camps after they leave. So we know what they eat. They eat primarily turtles and monkeys. They don't fish. They don't have fish hooks.

</details>

**主持人**: 他们不吃人，是吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: They They don't eat humans, do they?

</details>

**保罗**: 他们不吃人。他们不是食人部落。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: They do not eat humans. They are not cannibal tribes.

</details>

**主持人**: 那是人们以前谈论过的谣言。人们曾说。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: That's a rumor people have talked about before. People have said,

</details>

**保罗**: 是的，甚至在网上还有几个用**AI**合成的我声音的版本在说这个，但那不是真的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: "Yeah, there's even a couple versions of my voice in AI saying that on the internet, but it is not true."

</details>

**主持人**: 他们的发型，看起来都是那种鲻鱼头。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And their haircuts, they all seem to be have the sort of mullet style haircut from

</details>

**保罗**: 看起来他们都是抓住前面一撮头发，然后想办法剪掉。可能有一个拿着砍刀的人专门负责理发。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: It seems like they all grab the front and just find a way to cut it. There might be like one guy with a machete who just does the haircuts.

</details>

**主持人**: 对他们中的很多人来说，这是他们第一次见到人类。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And for a lot of them, this is the first time they've seen a human.

</details>

**保罗**: 所以，实际上，这是第一次接触。来到现场并管理这次互动的**人类学家**说，他以前在该地区遇到过未接触部落。他说这些都不是他见过的人。另外，注意他们都是男性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: So, actually, this was first contact. The anthropologist who came to the scene, who managed this interaction, he said he had met an unconted tribe before in the region. He said none of these were men that he'd met. And the other thing, notice they're all men.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**保罗**: 妇女们都藏在森林里。当男人们在我们面前制造干扰时，妇女们正在我们身后的农场里抢劫。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: The women were hidden hidden in the forest. And while the men were making a distraction in front of us, the women were raiding the farm behind us.

</details>

**主持人**: 抢劫。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Raiding

</details>

**保罗**: 抢劫农场。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: raiding the farm.

</details>

**主持人**: 你们的农场？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Your farm?

</details>

**保罗**: 原住民的农场。我们社区的农场。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: The indigenous people's farm. Our community's farm.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以女人们在他们分散你注意力的时候去偷东西了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So the women went to steal while they were distracting you.

</details>

**保罗**: 对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: That's right.

</details>

**主持人**: 你拍到那些女人了吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And did you catch the women on tape?

</details>

**保罗**: 不，不，不，不，不，不。所有人都挤在一起，非常非常近。我是说，那是一次不可思议的遭遇。但让我解释一下。整个过程中，最主要的情绪是恐惧，双方都害怕。他们害怕，我们也害怕。原住民本来就有霰弹枪。每个人都拿着霰弹枪。他们中有些人把弓放在沙滩上，但他们还有弓箭手在等待。所以每个人都像是，“放下你们的枪，我们就可以谈谈。”但没有人真正想放下他们的枪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: No. No. No. No. No. No. Everyone was We were all huddled up very, very close. I mean, this was an incredible encounter. But let me explain. The prevailing emotion during this entire thing was fear on both sides. They were scared. We were scared. The indigenous people naturally have shotguns anyway. Everyone had their shotguns out. They all had some of them had put their bows on the beach, but they had other they had archers waiting. And so everyone was sort of, you know, it was like, "Put down your guns and we can talk." But nobody really wanted to put down their guns.

</details>

**主持人**: 你怎么知道是女人从你们农场偷东西的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And how do you know the women were stealing from your farm?

</details>

**保罗**: 因为这一切结束后，我们去了农场，所有的**木薯**、所有的芭蕉、所有的甘蔗都被拔光了，整个农场都被毁了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Because after this was all over and we went to the farm, everything had been pulled up. All the yuka, all the plantains, all the sugarcane, the entire farm was ruined.

</details>

**主持人**: 你怎么知道是女人干的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How'd you know it was the women?

</details>

**保罗**: 村里的女人告诉我是女人干的。她们就是女人。而且，你看到那些小脚印。这些男人脚很大很宽。他们一辈子赤脚走路。他们的脚会变宽，变得非常厚。所以，我现在也有那样的丛林脚，但这些人现在几乎是鸭蹼脚了。那种又大又肥、长满老茧的脚会变得更宽。你见过农民的手吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: The women in the village told me it was the women. They was the women. Also, you see the smaller footprints. These men have wide big men. They're from walking barefoot their whole lives. Their feet get ancho. They get really thick. And so, and I have jungle feet like that now, but these guys have almost duck feet at this point. Like big, fat, calloused feet that get wider. You ever see a farmer's hands?

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**保罗**: 但他们的手就是会那样生长。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: But they just they just grow.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 他们都很年轻。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: They're all young as well.

</details>

**主持人**: 老年人在哪里？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Where's Where are the older people?

</details>

**保罗**: 我们很想知道。我们不知道。亚马逊有些部落，老年人有更固定的定居点。也有传闻说有些极端部落，如果老年人跟不上，就会被遗弃等死。但我们看到的人年龄大概在12到45岁之间。我觉得没有人看起来像50多岁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: We'd love to know. We don't know. There's some tribes in the Amazon where the elderly people have more permanent settlements. There's been rumors of some extreme tribes where the elderly people if they can't keep up are just left to perish. Uh but we saw people between the ages of probably 12 and 45. I don't think anybody looks like they're in their 50s.

</details>

**保罗**: 所以我们带着比答案更多的问题离开了。那天他们确实从社区偷了一个锅。农场里也有一把砍刀。有人把它砍进了一根木头里。所以当他们离开时，我们拍到的最好的视频之一，我们还不能分享的是，其中一个人，这是在所有人回家后，人类学家举起双手说：“**No Mole**，兄弟们，平安离开。”这些人实际上问起了我。我是那里唯一一个留着大胡子的人。他们说。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: So we left with more questions than answers. They on that day they did get a pot that they they stole from a from you know the community you know they have their their farm and so there there was also a machete at the farm. Somebody just whacked it into a log. And so as they were leaving, one of the best things that we caught on video that we have we're not able to share yet is that one of these guys, and this was at the end after while everybody was going home, the anthropologist held up his hands and he said, you know, no mole brothers, go in peace. And these guys actually asked about me. I was the only person there with a big beard. And they said,

</details>

**保罗**: 他们说：“那个人。”他们说：“给我们看看那个人。”于是我走上前去。我站在河边，我的心怦怦直跳。人类学家说：“举起你的手。让他们知道你没有恶意。”我举起双手，他们也举起双手，然后唱歌。他们说“**No Mole**”。他们知道我不是来自原住民社区的。那是一个不可思议的时刻，我们无法沟通，但那只是一种基本的“我承认你”的交流，他们也说“我承认你”。我们之间隔着一条河，隔着大约一千年，就这样。然后他们离开了，其中一个人拿着一把砍刀，他把它扛在肩上给我们看。我的一个朋友用当地语言说：“放下砍刀。把砍刀留下。”那个人只是笑了笑，看着我们，好像在说：“来拿啊，来拿啊。”然后就在他们离开时，其中一个战士走到沙滩上，把箭搭在弓弦上，对着我们笑了笑，然后射了出去。就像是，“哈！”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: they said that one. They said, show us that one. And so I came forward. I stood at the edge of the river, which my heart was pounding. And the anthropologist said, he said, hold up your hands. Show them that you don't mean any harm. I held hel held up my hands like this and they held up their hands and they sang. They said no more. They knew that I wasn't from the indigenous community. And that was an incredible moment of we couldn't communicate but it was just sort of that basic I acknowledge you and they said I acknowledge you and we just had this thing across the river in about a thousand years and just and then that was it. And as they left, you know, one of the guys had a machete and he was he showed it to us over his shoulder like this. And one of my friends was going, "Oh," you know, in the local language he was saying, "Put down the machete. Leave the machete." And the guy just smiled and looked at us like, "Yeah, come and get it. Come and get it." And then at just as they left, one of the warriors walked out to the beach, put an arrow on the string, smiled at us, and just shot it. Was like, "Ha!"

</details>

**主持人**: 射向空中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Up into the air,

</details>

**保罗**: 只是朝我们这边，只是为了吓唬我们。然后他们都转向左边离开了。所以他们有幽默感。我们看到他们笑了。我们也和他们进行了一些这样的交流。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: just at us in general, just to spook us. And then they all turned left and left, you know. So they have a sense of humor. We saw them smile, you know. We exchanged a little bit of that with them as well.

</details>

**主持人**: 他们看起来很冷。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: They look cold.

</details>

**保罗**: 他们确实冷。我是说，那天是95华氏度。另一件事是，当他们走过来的时候，非常酷。如果你去看他们走过海滩的那部分，那里有数百万只蝴蝶。那片海滩上覆盖着数百万只蝴蝶。所以当这些人走出来时，蝴蝶就在他们周围飞舞。回到开头。就在那里。如果你注意到，我们一开始没有注意到，但当他们移动时，看那里。世界充满了色彩斑斓的**鳞翅目昆虫**。简直是绝对的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: They are cold. I mean, it's it's it's 95° on that day. The other thing is it was cool as they're coming. If you go to the part where they're coming across the beach, there was millions of butterflies. That beach was covered in just millions of butterflies. And so as these people are walking out, the butterflies are just swarming around them. Go back to the beginning. The that right there. If you just notice, we don't notice it at first, but as they're moving, look at that. The world is swirling with leapid lepodopter in colors. Just just absolute

</details>

**主持人**: 疯狂，这个场景多么美丽。我是说，当你看到这个时，如果后面走出一只**霸王龙**，我也不会感到惊讶。那真是太奇怪了，简直令人难以置信。因为，你知道，这些人真的是地球上最后一批仍然以这种方式生活的人，而我们的社会有飞机、火车、汽车、**iPhone**，所有这些技术。我们正在谈论去其他星球。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: insanity how how beautiful this scene was. And I mean, when you see this, you know, if a if a Tyrannosaurus Rex walked out behind them, I wouldn't have been surprised. It was such a strange literally unbelievable thing to see because you know these these literally are the last people on Earth that are still living in this way where society we have planes, trains, automobiles, iPhones, all of this technology. We're talking about going to other planets.

</details>

**保罗**: 他们没有金属，甚至没有刀，除非他们从别人那里得到。所以这真是不可思议。另一件事是，他们确实拥有**药用技术**。他们能够在热带潮湿的丛林中保持免受感染。这相当不可思议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: They don't have metal, even a knife, unless they get it from someone else. And so it's just it's just an incredible, you know, the other thing is they do have medicinal technologies. They're able to stay infection-free living in the tropical wet jungle. That's pretty incredible

</details>

**主持人**: 因为他们几乎赤身裸体。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: cuz they're they're virtually naked.

</details>

**保罗**: 我是说，基本上是赤裸的。我想那只是他们携带绳子的方式。我认为那与其说是衣服，不如说是我们需要绳子，所以我们就这样携带它。这非常非常复杂，因为伐木工人会向他们开枪，**毒贩**也会向他们开枪。人们不应该进入他们居住的地方。如果你想想在过去的几个世纪里，有多少原住民文化被外部世界的入侵所摧毁，这样的故事不胜枚举。而在这个特殊案例中，在2026年，当我们有了沟通，人们能够听到这个故事时，这就是我们发布这些片段的原因，因为这些人唯一的希望就是我们保护他们。他们不能上播客。他们不能向**联合国**发言。他们不能写请愿书。他们唯一的希望就是我们能够保护他们赖以生存的森林。就是这样。这就是我们现在发布这些片段的原因。因为很长一段时间我们都说不能发布。我们说：“如果那些疯狂的嬉皮士下去，认为这些人是最后自由的人，想和他们一起生活怎么办？那会杀了他们。你我每天携带的外部病原体，我们有免疫力的普通感冒，都可能消灭整个部落。”我们认为亚马逊雨林中还有多少这样的部落？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: I mean, essentially naked. I think that's that's how they carry their rope. I don't think that's so much of clothing as we need rope and that's how we carry it. It's very it's very very complicated because the loggers shoot at them, the narcos shoot at them. People shouldn't be getting into the places that they live. And if you think about in the last few centuries, how many indigenous cultures have been annihilated by the outside world coming in these there's no shortage of these stories. And in this particular case, in 2026, when we have the communication and people are able to hear this story, this is why we're releasing this footage because the only hope these people have is if we protect them. They can't come on a podcast. They can't address the United Nations. They can't write a pet petition. The only hope they have is if we are able to protect the forest that they live in. That's it. And that's why we released this footage now. Cuz for a long time we said we can't release it. We said, "What if what if crazy hippie people go down there thinking that these are the last free people and they want to go live with them? That will kill them. The outside pathogens that you and I carry on us every day, the common cold that we have immunity to, could wipe out an entire tribe." And how many tribes like this do we believe are in the Amazon rainforest?

</details>

**保罗**: 几千个小部落，小氏族，他们游牧于亚马逊。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Several thousand little tribes, little clans that move nomatically through the Amazon.

</details>

**主持人**: 他们高吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Were they tall?

</details>

**保罗**: 他们看起来至少有5英尺9英寸，5英尺10英寸。他们相当高，尤其因为我们合作的秘鲁人和原住民社区通常身材较矮小。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: They looked like they were at least, you know, 5'9, 510. They were pretty tall, especially because the the Peruvians and the indigenous communities that we work with tend to be on the smaller side.

</details>

**主持人**: 他们比其他一些部落的平均身高要高。我们还在那里遇到过另一个部落，叫做**纳瓦部落**。那些人非常矮小。他们所有人身高都不到五英尺。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: They they they are taller than the average uh some of the other tribes. There's another tribe that we ran into down there called the Nawa. And those people were were absolutely tiny. They were s like below five feet. All of them. Um

</details>

**保罗**: 这些人很高。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: these guys were tall. Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 这里有领导者吗？有人负责吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And is there a leader here? Is someone in charge?

</details>

**保罗**: 另一个好问题。看起来有两个人，他们看起来像兄弟。似乎有两个人说话最多。其中一个特别喜欢做手势，他沟通起来更强硬。他会笑。那个人，他有时脸上会带着笑容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Another great question. It seems to be that there's two, they look like brothers. There seems to be two guys who do most of the talking. One in particular who seems to be doing the most gesticulating and he was communicating more forcefully. He He had a smile. That guy, he had a smile on his face at certain times.

</details>

**主持人**: 这个？

<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: This one?

**保罗**: 是的，我想是。他会走得最远，走到河里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: 是的。他看起来肌肉发达，很健康。

**主持人**: He's the biggest as well in size by the looks of it.

</details>

**保罗**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Okay.

</details>

**主持人**: 这些部落曾杀过人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: These tribes have been known to kill people.

</details>

**保罗**: 这些部落经常杀人。这件事发生后的第二天，我们顺流而下，在这次河对岸的谈判中一直维持和平的人是我的朋友**乔治**。**乔治**一直说：“别担心，会没事的。别担心，**No Mole**。”他会说：“我们再给他们一些香蕉吧。”他说：“你躲在树后面。说，嘿，请放下你的相机。他们不明白那不是枪。”他确保每个人都保持冷静。然而，第二天，**乔治**像往常一样在河里开船，他绕过一个河湾，部落又出来了。他们更往上游去了，通常他们离开后会深入丛林，但那天他们一直在沿着河走，这是谁也没想到的。所以当他的船绕过河湾时，他们没想到，然后就开火了。船上其他人都能躲到厚重的木凳下面。当他驾驶时，一支箭射中了他的肩胛骨，从他的肚脐旁边穿出。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: These tribes kill people all the time. The the day after this happened, we went down river and one of the people who had been maintaining the peace during this negotiation across the river was my friend George. And George kept saying, "Don't worry, it's going to be okay. Don't worry, no mole." And he would say, "Let's get them more bananas." And he said, "You stay behind the tree. Say, hey, please put down your camera. They don't understand that it's not a gun." He was making sure that everyone was calm. Well, George was driving the day after this in the river as he does every day and he rounded one riverbend and the tribe was out again. They were further up river and usually when they leave they go deep into the jungle but on this day they had been walking up the river which nobody expected and so when his boat came around the river they hadn't expected it and they open fired. Everybody else on the boat was able to get down under the the benches which is made out of heavy thick wood. As he was driving, he caught an arrow over the scapula, came out by his belly button.

</details>

**保罗**: 所以，它压垮了他的右肺，穿透了他的整个身体，他不得不被直升机从原住民社区撤离。他竟然活了下来。但他再也不会像以前一样了。我还可以告诉你一百个被他们杀死的人的故事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: So, it collapsed his right lung and cut through his whole body and he had to be helicopter evacuated out of the indigenous community. And somehow he lived. But he's never going to be the same. And there's there's a hundred stories I could tell you of people that have been killed by them.

</details>

**保罗**: 但现在，越来越多地有故事说他们也在被灭绝。所以他们的暴力是对外部世界对他们残酷的回应。他们能确保自己生存的唯一方式就是将外部世界拒之门外。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: But now and more and more there's stories of that they are also being exterminated. So their violence is in response to the fact that the outside world has been cruel to them. And the only way that they can ensure that they survive is by keeping the outside world out.

</details>

**主持人**: 这可能有点蠢，但秘鲁政府对此没有后果，对吗？秘鲁政府不会试图，你知道，如果这个未接触部落杀人，他们不一定会去那里执行任何法律。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: This is a might be a bit of a dumb question, but there's no consequence to that is there from the Peruvian government or anything. the proving government aren't trying to um you know if they if this uncontacted tribe kills somebody they're not necessarily going to go there and try and enforce any kind of like law.

</details>

**保罗**: 这实际上是一个很好的问题，因为它说明了我认为很多人根本不理解的一点，那就是，如果这个香蕉是最后一个城镇，然后你想象我们的河流有足球场那么大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: That's actually a great question because it illustrates something that I think a lot of people fundamentally don't understand about this is that you know if this banana is the last town and then you imagine just our river is the size of a football field.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Mhm.

</details>

**保罗**: 对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Right.

</details>

**保罗**: 你怎么才能穿过丛林到达河的另一边？穿过茂密的丛林，你大约需要一个小时才能走半英里。如果我和你现在拿着砍刀穿过茂密的丛林，每半英里大约需要一个小时。那是在没有小径的情况下。有小径的话，你可以走快一点。有船的话，你可以走快一点。但警察在城市之外没有管辖权。警察之所以有权力，只是因为所有人都同意有一个政府，他们有权力，但这都是虚构的。当你进入丛林，你会意识到野外没有法律。只有发生的事情。谁的棍子更大，谁说了算。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: How are you going to get to the other side of it in the jungle? It takes you about about an hour to cover half a mile through through dense jungle. If me and you were going with machetes right now through dense dense jungle, about an hour for every half mile. That's with no trail. With trail, you can go a little faster. With a boat, you can go a little faster. But the police have no jurisdiction outside of the city. The only reason the police have power is because everyone has agreed that there's a government and that they have power and that there's a but it's all made up. And when you go out in the jungle, you realize that there is no law in the wild. It's just whatever happens. It's who has a bigger stick.

</details>

**保罗**: 所以他们仍然按照那个游戏规则行事。他们从没听说过法律。所以他们会发现一些有趣的东西，就像，你知道，今天如果我们对一只鸟感兴趣，我们会给它拍照，然后研究它，或者我们可以捕捉它，我们可以研究它。你知道，有时人们会批评**泰迪·罗斯福**是个猎人，但很多物种，如果他看到一个新物种，他会射杀它以便研究。那是他们当时的做法。但他们对人类也这样做。他们会说：“那条裤子很有趣。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And so they're still playing by that game. They've never heard of a law. And so they they've been known to find something interesting just the way and you know today if we're interested in a bird, we take a picture of it and then we study it or we can capture it. We can study it. You know, sometimes people will criticize Teddy Roosevelt for being a hunter, but a lot of the species, if he saw a new species, he would shoot it so that he could study it. That was what they did back then. But they do this with humans. They'll be like, "That's an interesting pair of pants."

</details>

**保罗**: 他们对生死的看法似乎非常不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: They seem to think about life and death very differently.

</details>

### 部落的动物语言与生存哲学

**主持人**: 我还看了你做的一个播客，你说这些未接触部落中的一些人也说同样的语言，那就是猴子的语言。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And I was watching something um a podcast that you did where you said that they also speak the same language. some of these unconted tribes is the monkeys.

</details>

**保罗**: 是的。他们会模仿**卷尾猴**的叫声、鸟叫声，还有**锡那穆鸟**的叫声。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Yes. Um so what they do is they will emulate capacin calls, bird calls, the unrelated tinn tinimu goes.

</details>

**保罗**: 卷尾猴的叫声我模仿不来，但这些人模仿得非常完美。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Um the capachens I can't do their call but these guys have it down perfectly.

</details>

**主持人**: 卷尾猴是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Capagins being

</details>

**保罗**: 卷尾猴。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: capagin monkeys

</details>

**保罗**: 他们会使用这些声音。**JJ**的父亲**唐·圣地亚哥**多年前告诉我们，我们以为他只是想吓唬我们。他说：“如果你在森林里听到动物的声音有点不对劲，如果你觉得有什么不对劲，他说，那他们已经包围了你，他们都拿着弓箭在看着你。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: and they'll use those sounds. And JJ's father Don Santiago had told us years and years ago he said we thought he was just trying to scare us. He said, "If you're ever in the forest and you hear the animals sound a little off, if you ever just feel like something's not right about the way the He" He said, "They've surrounded you and they're all watching with their bows and arrows."

</details>

**主持人**: 部落已经。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: The tribes have.

</details>

**保罗**: 是的。所以他们会发出声音，你就会想：“等等，等等。”你不会听到连续三声**锡那穆鸟**的叫声。不是那样的。一只锡那穆鸟会和另一只锡那穆鸟说话，然后突然间我周围有五只锡那穆鸟。不行。然后你就知道部落在你周围了。所以这就是当地人知道这些事情如何运作的地方。对于任何来自外面的人说，没有未接触部落，他们不交流。是的，他们交流。我的一个朋友就处于那种情况，他们用动物的叫声在圈子里交流，当时他和他的父亲在一条溪流里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Yeah. And so they'll go and you'll go and he'll go and you go, "Wait, wait a sec." You don't hear three tinus in a row. That's not how it works. That one tineu talks to the other tineu and all of a sudden I got five tinus around me. Uh-uh. And then you know you got the tribe around you. And so this is where the local people know how this stuff works. And to anyone from the outside that goes, there's no such thing as unconted tribes and they don't communicate. Yeah, they do. And one of my friends was in that exact situation where they were communicating with animal calls in a circle while he was in a stream with his father

</details>

**保罗**: 不幸的是，他们射中了他父亲的肚子，他父亲去世了。然后他跑了，活下来讲述了这个故事。第二天，他的社区，我们的朋友们回来了，他们发现了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: and unfortunately they shot his father in the stomach and his father died. And then he ran for it and he lived to tell the tale. And the next day the his community, our friends came back and they found

</details>

**保罗**: 这个人肚子流血而死。他们为什么杀他，我们不知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: this guy who had just bled out through his stomach. And why they killed him, we do not know.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以他们假装是动物。但是，他们用动物的声音互相交流。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So they pretend they're animals. Um but well, they they use animal sounds to communicate with each other.

</details>

**保罗**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Yes.

</details>

**主持人**: 因为这样猎物，在这种情况下可能是人类。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Because then the prey, which in this case might be a human,

</details>

**保罗**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 就不会知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: won't know that it's

</details>

**保罗**: 完全正确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: exactly.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。所以，如果我们要说：“好吧，我们分头包围。”我们现在是未接触部落。我们说：“好吧，那边有伐木工人。我们分头包围他们。看看他们有多少人。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Okay. So, if I'm going if we go, okay, let's split up and surround. We're we're we're unconted tribes now. And we go, okay, there's loggers over there. Let's split up, surround them. We'll see how many of them there are.

</details>

**主持人**: 并使用猴子的语言。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And use the monkeys language to

</details>

**保罗**: 使用猴子的语言。他们不会觉得有什么。他们会继续做他们正在做的事情。然后当我们发出信号时，所有人，我们就会用七英尺长的箭射杀他们，他们都会倒下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: use the monkey language. They don't think anything of it. They'll just keep doing what they're doing. And then when we give the go-ahad, everybody, we just slice them with seven foot arrows and they're all going down.

</details>

**保罗**: 我本来想问关于幸福的问题，但我甚至不知道在什么语境下问他们的幸福。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: I was I was going to ask about happiness, but I don't even know the context in which to ask the question about their happiness.

</details>

**保罗**: 不，我想**科马克·麦卡锡**的一些引言可能更能体现他们的现实，而不是幸福这个概念。我认为他们生活在一个更关心卡路里的世界。他们更关心走一英里要付出多少血的代价。他们更关心从其他部落偷走女人。他们不关心幸福。这更像是末日景象，而不是**唐顿庄园**。他们处于绝望之中。你可以从他们的脸上看出来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: No, I think I think that there's some some Coror Mc McCarthy quotes that would probably do better justice to their reality than the idea of happiness. I think that they are living in a world where they're more concerned with calories. They're more concerned with how much blood does it cost to walk a mile. They're more concerned with stealing the women from other tribes. They're not concerned with happiness. It's more apocalyptto than uh Downtown Abbey. You know, it's it's they're they're in a state of desperation. You could see it in their face.

</details>

**保罗**: 这就引出了一个更深层次的人类学问题：这些人的未来会怎样？但我们确切知道一件事，那就是快速接触会摧毁他们。以前发生过。所有这些以前都发生过。当外部世界接触到未接触部落时，病原体就会杀死他们。当外部世界接触到即使是原住民社区时，酒精、外部病原体、金钱都可以在一代人之间摧毁一种原住民文化，并夺走他们的语言。所以，这些严重孤立的文化，如果他们想走出来与他们的邻居原住民社区接触，那必须随着时间的推移慢慢发生。他们必须有自主权来做这件事，这意味着他们的森林需要被保护。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And that's where there's a further anthropological question of what happens in the future for these people. But one thing that we know for certain is that rapid contact destroys them. It's happened before. All of this has happened before. You know, when the outside world reaches an unconted tribe, the pathogens kill them. When the outside world reaches even an indigenous community, alcohol, outside pathogens, money can destroy an indigenous culture and take away their language in a single generation. So, so these types of of severely isolated cultures, if they want to come out and make contact with the indigenous communities that are their neighbors, that has to happen over time. And and they have to have the agency to do it, which means their forest needs to be protected.

</details>

**保罗**: 这就是我们所知道的一切。我们不知道他们的出生率是多少，婴儿死亡率是多少，他们的老人住在哪里，他们的创世神话是什么，他们的信仰是什么？我们一无所知。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And so that's that's and that's all we know. You know, we don't know what their birth rates are, what their infant mortality rates are, where their old people are, what what what what are their creation myths, what are their beliefs? We have no idea.

</details>

**主持人**: 我们甚至知道他们住在哪里吗？他们住在茅屋里，还是房子里？我们知道吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Do we even know where they live in terms of do they live in huts, houses? Do we know that?

</details>

**保罗**: 不，他们不住。事实上，就在此刻，我想象他们中有些人正蜷缩在160英尺高的树冠下的黑暗中，围着篝火。你知道，因为当你在丛林里时，有这些高耸的柱子，但那是一个4D环境，因为你只是在行走。就像你在海底行走一样。你是一个微小的生物。在你上方是所有这些蠕动的生命，青蛙和在树枝间移动的东西。所以他们蜷缩在那里，在亚马逊雨林之下。他们不知怎么地学会了生火。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: No, they don't. In fact, at this very moment right now, uh I would imagine that there's several of them hunched around a campfire in the darkness beneath 160 ft of canopy. You know, because when you're in the jungle, there's there's these these pillars going up, but then it's a it's a 4D environment because it's just you're walking. It's like you're walking along the bottom of the ocean. You're this tiny thing. And above you is all of this slithering life and frogs and things moving through the branches. And so they're they're huddled down there in the and below the Amazon rainforest. And somehow they figured out how to make fire,

</details>

**保罗**: 如果我给你一个打火机和一整杯汽油，然后说：“在丛林里，你想要多少木头都行。”你现在仍然无法为我生火。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: which if I handed you a lighter and a full cup of gasoline and said, "Have all the sticks you want in the jungle," you still couldn't make me a fire right now.

</details>

**主持人**: 你怎么知道他们会生火？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How do you know they can make fire?

</details>

**保罗**: 因为我们看到他们做饭。我们找到了他们的营地。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Because we see them cook stuff. We find their camps.

</details>

**保罗**: 但这也说得通，因为他们没有锅。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: But it's also conceivable because they don't have pots.

</details>

**保罗**: 可以想象，他们中有些人从未见过水烧开，对吧？他们只是喝水，水从天而降。他们当然不知道水会结冰。关于幸福这一点，你说你从他们脸上看到了绝望，但这是否意味着你认为他们不幸福？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: It's conceivable that that that they some of these people haven't seen water boil, right? They just drink water and it falls on them from the sky. They certainly don't know that water freezes. On this point of happiness, you said you saw desperation in their faces, but does that mean that you think they're not happy,

</details>

**主持人**: 或者你只是认为。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: or do you just think that

</details>

**主持人**: 那甚至不是他们会考虑的范畴？一切都关乎生存。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: that isn't even a sort of a paradigm that they even consider? It's all about survival.

</details>

**保罗**: 我认为我们天生就喜欢享受快乐的时刻。我认为人类喜欢互动和玩耍的时刻。不只是人类，我认为动物普遍如此。你看，两只小狗互相追逐，它们玩得很开心。即使在那一天，枪支上膛，弓箭拉满，我们仍然找到了互相微笑的时刻。把那把砍刀给我。是的，是的。来拿啊。我们有点像，你知道，你和我们一样害怕。那是一个我们彼此微笑时，处于同一水平的时刻。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: I think that we have we're inbuilt to enjoy moments of joy. I think that humans enjoy moments of interaction, moments of play. And not just humans, I think that animals in general. You look at, you know, two puppies chasing each other. They're having fun. You know, even on even on this day with shotguns loaded and bows cocked and we still found the time to smile a little bit at each other. Give me that machete. Yeah. Yeah. Come and get it. And we kind of like, you know, it was kind of like you're just as scared of us as we are as you. And it was it was a it was we were on the same level for that smile,

</details>

**主持人**: 你知道吗？我当时想，哦，好吧。是的。我们都不想那样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: you know? And I was like, oh, okay. Yeah. None of us want to do that.

</details>

**保罗**: 嗯，所以那里有幸福。但我想说的是，知识带来好处。你知道，他们可能相信很多事情，我记得我在大学时读到过一个**人类学家**团队去了**新几内亚**的某个地方，所有人都躲在树上，因为他们的文明发展到了一点，他们相信所有坏事都来自魔法咒语。你知道，如果我摔断腿，那是因为你对我施了魔法咒语；如果我生病了，那也是因为魔法咒语。所有人都害怕惹恼对方，所以他们都开始住在树上，狩猎，他们生活在一种持续的恐惧状态中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Um, and so there's there is happiness there. But I'm saying, you know, uh knowledge comes with benefits. You know, there's a lot of things that they may believe that I I remember when I was in college reading about an anthrop anthropologist group that got to somewhere in New Guinea and all the people were hiding in trees cuz they had they'd gotten to a point in their civilization where that where they believed that everything that bad that was bad came from magical spells. You know, if I fall and break my leg, it's cuz you set a magical spell on me and if I get sick, it's because of a magical spell. And everybody was so scared of upsetting each other that they'd all just started living in the trees and hunting and they were living in this constant fear state.

</details>

**保罗**: 所以，你知道，在那种时候，你需要有人说：“好吧，伙计们，看，这就是正在发生的事情。让我们达成共识。”他们也许可以通过拥有一个小芭蕉种植园来获得帮助。所以，如果他们狩猎不顺利，他们就可以进来，得到一些自己的食物。他们不需要开始农业生产。他们仍然可以是游牧的狩猎采集者，但也许在他们知道的地点有一些补充食物会有帮助。但这些是当地人和人类学家需要随着时间推移解决的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And so, you know, you at times like that, you need someone to go, "Okay, guys, look, here's what, you know, here's what's happening. Let's get let's get let's get on the same page." And they may maybe they would be helped by having a small plantation of plantains. And so, if they have a bad week of hunting, they can just come in and they can they can take some of their own make get some of their own food. They don't need to start being agricultural. They can still be nomadic hunter gatherers, but maybe having some supplemental food out there in locations that they know about would help. But these are things for the local people and for anthropologists to figure out over time.

</details>

**主持人**: 我听你说过，那些被外部社区抚养长大的部落儿童，声称不记得他们在部落里的任何事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I heard you say that children from the tribe who were raised by outside communities claim to remember nothing about their time in the tribe.

</details>

**保罗**: 这令人心痛。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: It's haunting.

</details>

**主持人**: 你这是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What do you mean by that?

</details>

**保罗**: 我是说，一个孩子被冲到亚马逊雨林一个非常偏远的社区，被一个原住民社区收养，这些人既说原住民语言也说西班牙语。当他长大到可以被提问时，有人问他：“嘿，顺便问一下，你和**洛斯卡拉托斯**（那些裸体的人，他们这样称呼他们）一起生活时是什么样的？”他只是说：“我不记得了。”然后走开了。但我是说，他被冲下来的时候才8岁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: I mean that a child washed down river on a log to one of the very very remote communities in the Amazon rainforest and was adopted by an indigenous community, people that speak an indigenous language as well as Spanish. And when he was old enough to be asked questions, someone said, "Hey, by the way, when you were living with Los Kalatos with the with the naked people, that's what they call them. Um, what was it like?" and he just went, "I don't remember." And walked away. But I mean, when he came down, he was 8 years old.

</details>

**保罗**: 你不能告诉我你什么都不记得了。但那是一种有保留的“我不记得了”。那是一种“我不记得了。拒绝访问。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: You can't tell me you don't remember anything. And but it was a it was a it was a it was a guarded I don't remember. It was a I don't remember. No. Access denied.

</details>

**保罗**: 这并不意味着，我是说，你知道，人们误解了，他们会说：“哦，这些人仍然与大自然和谐共处。”但事实是，那里也有很多强奸、谋杀和战争，可能还有不必要的感染和疾病死亡，他们过着非常不同的生活方式，但他们仍然存在，这确实令人着迷。我认为这只能说明我们在这里保护的确实是那样的原始之地。因为很多人会问我：“你们为什么如此专注于保护这条河流？亚马逊有成千上万条支流。为什么只保护那里的30万英亩？”就像是，好吧，这是最原始的部分。**约翰·缪尔**曾带**泰迪·罗斯福**去露营，当时他想让罗斯福保护**优胜美地山谷**和**红杉树**。他说：“你必须看看这个。”所以他带罗斯福去看了，向他展示了那里的奇妙之处。我是说，那样的红杉树在地球上其他任何地方都不存在。它们是地球上最大的树木。如果他们没有保护它们，它们就会消失。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: It doesn't I mean, you got you know, and that's what people get wrong where they go, "Oh, these people still live, you know, in communion with nature." And it's like, yeah, and there's a lot of rape and murder and warfare and probably needless death from infections and disease and and and they're living a very different lifestyle, but it certainly is fascinating that they're out there. And I think that it only goes to illustrate that we what we're protecting here is truly that wild. Because a lot of people will say to me, well, how come you guys are so focused on protecting this river? There's thousands of tributaries in the Amazon. Why protect this 300,000 acres right there? It's like, well, this is the wildest part. John Mirror took Teddy Roosevelt on a camping trip when he wanted him to protect the Yusede Valley and the Sequoia trees. And he said, you have to see this. And so, he took Roosevelt and showed him how amazing it was. I mean, sequoia trees like that exist nowhere else on Earth. They're the biggest trees on the planet. If he if they hadn't protected them, they'd be gone.

</details>

**保罗**: 所以他们有远见保护了那些树木，我们现在仍然有**红杉树**。所以我们在这条河上也在做同样的事情。通过保护30万英亩的森林，我们确保那些千年古树，那些生命的摩天大楼，继续拥有猴子、爬行动物、两栖动物、鸟类、哺乳动物，确保这些部落继续生活在遥远的地区。然后再次用足球场的类比，在这片广阔的荒野中，我们找到了一种方法，就像用一个小小的针孔，让人们真正看到这个神奇的地方。所以，你知道，整个地方99.99%都是原始的。我们建造了那个树屋，让我们的捐助者，我们的一些人知道，因为现在世界各地的人都在帮助我们拯救这条河流。而那个树屋，那是一个梦想。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And so them having the foresight to protect those trees, then we still have sequoia trees. And so that's what we're doing on this river. It's like by protecting 300,000 acres of forest, we ensure that those millennium trees, those skyscrapers of life continue to have monkeys, reptiles, amphibians, birds, mammals, that these tribes continue to live out in the far reaches. And then again to use the football field analogy in this vast expanse of wilderness, we found a way to use just like a little pin prick to actually bring people and let them see this amazing place. And so we, you know, the whole 99.99% of the thing is wild. And we that's why we built that treehouse to let you know some of our donors, some of our people, cuz now people from all over the world are helping us save this river. and the treehouse. That was a dream.

**保罗**: 所以我第一次看到它时，我爬上了丛林中最高的树，花了几个小时，黎明时我站在树枝上，看到了阳光照亮了穿过树冠的雾河。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And so the first time I saw it, I had climbed the tallest tree in the jungle, which took hours, and I was standing on a branch at dawn, and I saw the sun illuminate the mist river going across the canopy.

</details>

**保罗**: 我当时想，我必须和人们分享这个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And I went, I have to share this with people.

</details>

**保罗**: 所以我们在**特拉伊尔马**边缘的一个岬角上建造了那个树屋，俯瞰丛林，这样人们就可以看到保护区，看到他们正在保护的所有森林。因为在这一点上，我们看到这个，再看看下面的那张照片，那就是荒地。那就是不保护亚马逊的后果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And so we built that treehouse on a promontory at the edge of the terrairma looking out over the jungle so that people can see the reserve, see all the forest that they're protecting. Because at this point, the way we've see this and see that picture below it, that's the wasteland. That's what happens when you don't protect the Amazon.

**主持人**: 你对这些未接触部落的生活方式有一点点嫉妒吗？你有没有想过体验他们一天的世界，或者希望自己能花些时间过他们的生活？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Are you at all on some level jealous of how these unconted tribes live? Is there any part of you that wants to go and experience their world for a day or wishes you could spend some time living how they live?

</details>

**保罗**: 不。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: No.

</details>

**主持人**: 不。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: No,

</details>

**保罗**: 不。我真的很喜欢和我的原住民朋友们一起玩，比如花一天时间钓**食人鱼**。嗯，但我也真的很喜欢我的相机胶卷，喜欢摄影，喜欢拥有现代医学，喜欢在丛林里和妈妈**FaceTime**。我是说，我没有对他们的状态有任何浪漫主义的看法。那看起来像是压力和命运。我不需要，我不想，我当然不想那样做。那么，你从他们身上学到或领悟到什么，是像我这样花很多时间在屏幕上，生活在西方世界的人会觉得有用的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: no. I really enjoy hanging out with my native friends like when spending a day piranha fishing. Um, but I also really love my camera roll and doing photography and having modern medicine and being able to FaceTime my mom when I'm in the jungle. Like, you know, I I don't I don't I don't I no romanticism about their state. That that seems like stress and destiny. I don't I don't need to I don't want I certainly don't want to do that now. Is there anything that you learned or gleaned from them that I know a westerner like me who's spending a lot of time on I know screens and stuff and the way we live our lives might find useful.

</details>

**保罗**: 我不认为我们已经到了他们传授经验的阶段。我认为我们正处于学习该问哪些问题的阶段。那是第一次接触。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: I don't think that that we're at the point where they're imparting lessons. I think we're we're at the point where we're learning which questions we want to ask. That was first contact.

</details>

**保罗**: 所以在这一点上，我们的工作是弄清楚我们如何前进？他们需要什么？我们如何以道德的方式保护这片森林？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And so at this point our job is to figure out how do we how do we move forward? What do we what do they need? How do we ethically proceed in protecting this forest?

**主持人**: I don't know any founder who started their business because they like doing admin. But whether you like it or not, it's a huge part of running a business successfully. And it's something that can quickly become allconuming, confusing, and honestly a real tax because you know it's taking your attention away from the most important work. And that's why our sponsor Intuit QuickBooks helps my team streamline a lot of their admin. I asked my team about it and they said it saves them around 12 hours a month. 78% of Intuit QuickBooks users say it's made running their business significantly easier. And Intuate QuickBooks new AI agent works with you to streamline all of your workflows. They sync with all of the tools that you currently use. They automate things that slow the wheel in the process of your business. They look after invoicing, payments, financial analysis, all of it in one place. But what is great is that it's not just AI. There's still human support on hand if you need it. Intuit QuickBooks has evolved into a platform that scales with growing businesses. So if you want help getting out of the weeds, out of admin, just search for Intuit QuickBooks. Now, there's a phase a lot of companies hit where they're no longer doing the most important thing, which is selling. And they get really bogged down with admin. And it's often something that creeps up slowly and you don't really notice until it's happened. Slowly momentum starts to leak out. This happened to us. And our sponsor, Pipe Drive, was a fix I came across 10 years ago. And ever since my teams across my different companies have continued to use it. Pipe Drive is a simple but powerful sales CRM that gives you the visibility on any deals in your pipeline. It also automates a lot of the tedious, repetitive, and timeconuming parts of the sales process which in turn saves you so many hours every single month which means you can get back to selling. Making that early decision to switch to Pipe Drive was a real gamecher and it's kept the right things front of mind. My favorite feature is Pipe Drive's ability to sync your CRM with multiple email inboxes so your entire team can work together from one platform. And we aren't the only ones benefiting.

**主持人**: 你有什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What do you got?

</details>

**保罗**: 我的意思是，在这么多照片中，你都抱着巨大的蛇。当我说巨大的蛇时，我指的不是你们听众想象的那种蛇。我指的是**森蚺**大小的蛇。哦，是的，这是我和**JJ**第一次抓到的第一条大森蚺。它只有大约12英尺长。是的，这条蛇很棒，因为我以前从未抓过大蛇。我总是，你知道，你抓一条小蛇，我从**史蒂夫·欧文**那里学到，你知道，你抓蛇的尾巴，它可能会试图咬你。如果你抓不住它的尾巴，蛇每次都会跑掉。蛇永远不会攻击你，句号。所以我学会了抓蛇的尾巴，然后一旦你抓住它的尾巴，它就会回来试图阻止你抓住它的尾巴。太棒了。如果你需要，你可以抓住它的头部，这样你就控制了蛇。但如果你抓住头部，你就控制了蛇。所以那第一条蛇，我是说，我指的是一条12英尺长的蛇，至少有我的腿那么粗。我跑进去，跳起来，抓住了蛇的头部。大错特错。它缠住了我的手臂。我意识到的第一件事是，我被森蚺“铐”住了。现在我即使想放开蛇也做不到，因为它缠住了我的手腕。然后第二圈缠住了我的肩膀。现在我感觉到，我甚至能听到我的锁骨开始弯曲，就像树枝折断前的声音。**JJ**抓住了蛇的尾巴，把它拉开了。然后他的另一个兄弟，他们在我快要，我是说，我的眼睛真的要掉出来了的时候，赶到了我身边。它会把你压碎。这就是会发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: I mean, in so many of these photos, you're holding massive snakes. And when I say massive snakes, I don't mean the snakes you guys listening are thinking about. I mean, anaconda sized snakes like, oh yeah, this was this was me and JJ's first first big anaconda that we big anaconda we caught. It was only about 12 feet. And uh yeah, that one that one this was a great snake because I'd never caught a big snake before. I'd always been, you know, you catch a small snake and I'd learned from Steve Irwin, you know, you catch a catch a snake by the tail and it's it might try to bite you. If you don't get it by the tail, snake's going to run away every time. Snakes are not never going to attack you, period. So, I learned you catch a snake by the tail and then it's once you get it by the tail, it's going to come back at you and try and stop you from grabbing its tail. Great. And if you need to, you can get it by the head and you got control of the snake. But if you have the head, you have the snake. So that first snake, I mean, I'm talking about a 12ft snake that's, you know, that's at least as thick as my leg. And I ran in there and I dove and I grabbed the snake by the head. Big mistake. Wraps around my arms. And the first thing that I realized was I had an anaconda handcuffs. Now I couldn't I couldn't release the snake if I wanted to because it was around my wrists. And then the second coil came around my shoulders. And now I'm feeling the I can actually hear my collar bone start to flex the way a stick sounds right before it snaps. And JJ grabbed the snake by the tail and pulled the tail off. And then his other brother, they got to me right as I was about to I mean literally the eyes were going to come out of my head. It was going to crush you. That's what happens.

</details>

**保罗**: 所以他在最后一刻把它拉开了。所以那是我最接近知道那种感觉的时刻。但这甚至还不是一条大蛇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And so he pulled that right off at the last second. So that was about as close as I came to knowing what it feels like. But that's not even a big one.

</details>

**主持人**: 我觉得你更接近了一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I think you came a little bit closer.

</details>

**保罗**: 是的。不，那确实是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Yeah. No, that's that that's a

</details>

**主持人**: 给我解释一下这个。所以，对于那些看不到的人，我强烈建议你们现在看看屏幕。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Explain this to me. So, for anyone that can't can't see, I would highly recommend you look at the screen now.

</details>

**保罗**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Um,

</details>

**主持人**: 请别看。别看。别听他的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: please look away. Look away. Don't listen to him.

</details>

**主持人**: 这绝对是一个疯狂的故事。这张照片里发生了什么？你为什么要那样做？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: This is a an absolutely crazy story. What What's going on in this photo? And why did you do that?

</details>

**保罗**: 当然。这实际上是一个非常重要的故事。你知道，你听人们谈论，如果你想在任何事情上取得成功，你必须非常熟悉失败。你几乎要学会热爱它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Sure. This is actually a very important story. You know, you hear these people talk about how if you're going to succeed at anything, you have to become very familiar with losing. You almost got to learn to love it.

</details>

**保罗**: 所以当我们踏上这段探索亚马逊、与原住民建立关系、研究**森蚺**并找到保护这个地方的方法的旅程时，大约24岁时，**探索频道**联系了我。他们说：“孩子，我们从未见过像你这样的人。我们来做一个节目，带人们进入亚马逊雨林，向他们展示森蚺。”我说：“那太棒了。”我说：“我很想做。我可以教人们关于森林的知识。我们走吧。”他们说：“太好了。唯一的问题是，他们说，你知道，如果我们只是展示你将要做的科学研究，那还不够好。因为我们想把它们作为生态系统的顶级捕食者，你知道，如果系统中有**汞**，它们就会生物累积在那里。亚马逊中的任何毒素，它们都会吸收。它会进入鱼类，然后进入**凯门鳄**，进入鸟类，进入森蚺。它们是顶级捕食者。我们正在对森蚺进行开创性的研究。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And and so as we set out on this journey to explore the Amazon and to build relationships with the indigenous people and to study anacondas and to find a way to protect this place, at around 24 years old, I got approached by Discovery Channel. And they said, "Kid, we've never seen one like you. Let's do a show where we take people into the Amazon rainforest and show them anacondas." And I said, "That'd be amazing." I said, "I would love to do that. I could teach people about the forest. Let's let's go." They said, 'Great. The only thing is they said, you know, it's not a good enough show if we just show them the science that you're going to do. Because we wanted to use as the apex predators of the ecosystem, they're, you know, if there's mercury in the system, they're bioaccumulating there. Any toxins that are in the Amazon, they're going to absorb. It's going to get into the fish and then into the cayman, into the birds, into the anacondas. They're the apex predator. We were doing groundbreaking research on anacondas.

</details>

**保罗**: 他们说那还不够好。他们说，想象一下，如果他们说没有人，你知道，**网纹蟒**吃过人。他们说：“从未有记录显示森蚺吃人。”我说：“这确实发生过。我知道有几个人，他们的祖母或叔叔被森蚺吃掉了。这确实发生过，但没有人拍到照片。”所以他们说：“好吧，如果我们给你做一套非常昂贵的衣服，你愿意被森蚺吃掉吗？”我说：“我试试。”我说：“它不会吃我。蛇是甜心。它不会试图吃我。”他们说：“但是看，我们会把节目叫做《**亚马逊远征**》。派你和一支科学家团队去那里。我们会把整个过程拍下来。”长话短说，我同意了，因为我当时想的是，我一直看到森林被烧毁。我一直看到我的千年古树倒下，所有那些猴子、鸟儿、蛇和美丽的动物都被焚烧殆尽。他们告诉我，我所要做的就是获得一个能触及数百万人的电视节目，让我把这个信息传播出去。我所要做的就是在节目结束时做这个愚蠢的特技，向人们展示蛇并没有那么可怕。所以我们拍摄了这个节目，持续了6周。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: They said that wasn't good enough. They said, imagine if they said no one's, you know, reticulated pythons have eaten people. They said, "No one's ever had on record an anaconda eating a human." And I said, "It happens. It happens. I know a few people whose grandmother or uncle was eaten by an anaconda. It happens, but it doesn't happen where people no one's taking a picture of it." And so they said, "Well, if we make you a really expensive suit, will you get eaten by an anaconda?" I said, "I'll try." I said, "It's not going to eat. Snakes are sweethearts. It's not going to try to eat me." And they said, "But look, we we'll call the show Expedition Amazon. Send you out there with a team of scientists. We'll film the whole thing." Long story short, I agreed to it because what I thought at the time was, I keep seeing forest getting burned. I keep seeing my millennium trees go down, all of those monkeys and birds and snakes and beautiful animals that are getting incinerated. And they're telling me all I got to do to get a TV show that'll reach millions of people and let me get that message out there. All I got to do is at the end do this silly stunt to show people that snakes aren't that bad. And so we filmed this show for 6 weeks.

</details>

**主持人**: 你同意了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You agreed to what?

</details>

**保罗**: 我同意了可能被**森蚺**吃掉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: I agreed to potentially be eaten by an anaconda.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Okay.

</details>

**保罗**: 我的意思是，如果它想吃我，我有一个呼吸管，我有一个，它理论上可以吃掉我，但我知道它不会，因为我了解蛇。但制片人非常，你知道，这些人从未离开过办公室大楼，看了太多电影，他们想看一个人被蛇吃掉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: I mean, if it wanted if it wanted to, I had a breathing tube and I had a um it theoretically could have eaten me, but I knew it wouldn't cuz I know snakes. But the producers were very, you know, these are people that have never left the the the office building and have watched too many movies, and they wanted to see a guy get eaten by a snake.

</details>

**主持人**: 你自愿的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And you volunteered.

</details>

**保罗**: 当然，我会自愿。为了拯救森林，我甚至会砍掉我的脚。我愿意做任何事来拯救森林。所以，当有人给你这样的机会时，这很有趣，我实际上和**珍·古道尔**谈过这件事。我说，我有一个这样的机会，我想我可以用一种方式来处理，就是，你知道，我们带人们进行一次亚马逊探险，最后，我会穿着特制的衣服跳进坑里，让蛇缠绕在我身上，我会向人们展示森蚺实际上是多么可爱。她说，我不认为这会顺利。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Of course, I'd volunteer. I would have cut off my foot to save the forest. I'll do anything to save the forest. And so, when somebody gives you a chance like this, and it's funny, I actually spoke to Jane Goodall about this. I said, there's this chance I have and I think I could use I think I can navigate this in such a way that that at the, you know, we take people on an expedition through the Amazon, and at the end, I'll go I'll get in the pit in a special suit and I'll let the snake wrap around me and I'll show people that anacondas are really these, you know, sweethearts. And she said, I don't think it's going to go well.

</details>

**主持人**: 对于那些不知道**珍·古道尔**是谁的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: For anyone that doesn't know who Jane Goodall is,

</details>

**保罗**: **珍·古道尔**，著名的**灵长类动物学家**，一位震撼世界的科学家，她将人类从“工具制造者”重新定义为我们现在的样子，她为环保、野生动物、女性科学所做的贡献比几乎任何人都多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Jane Goodall, the famous pimeatlogist, the earthshattering scientist who redefined humans from men, the toolmaker to what we are now, the one who did more for conservation, wildlife, women's science than just about anybody else.

</details>

**主持人**: 她也是你的书封面上引用的那个人，她说：“为了我所爱的森林，谢谢你，保罗，写了这本书。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And she's also the um person that quoted on the front of your book saying, "On behalf of the forests that I love, thank you, Paul, for writing this book."

</details>

**主持人**: 显然，从你的故事中可以看出，她是你长久以来的英雄。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Clearly from reading through your story, she's um she's quite a hero of yours and has been for a long long time.

</details>

**保罗**: 是的。我是说，从我父母给我和妹妹讲睡前故事的时候，你知道，**珍·古道尔**和**黑猩猩戈梅**的故事，她不听规则，给它们命名。尽管她的同事说：“你永远不要给你的研究对象命名。”但她说：“它们有名字。它们有性格。它们有名字。”她打破了所有规则。所以我是伴随着**珍**这个历史人物长大的，但她仍然是一个活着的历史人物。所以当我真正见到她时，那真是太不可思议了，因为我在她的一次演讲中见到了她。这次经历影响了我余生。她展现出的优雅和智慧改变了我这个人，因为我在**纽约市**她的一次演讲中见到了她。我打印了几章。我打印了成为我第一本书的其中一章，我在那里照顾一只小**巨型食蚁兽**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Yeah. I mean, and going from when my parents were reading us, me and my sister, they'd be reading us stories at night, you know, Jane Goodall and Gome with the chimps and how she she didn't listen to the rules, she named them. Even though her her colleagues said, "You never name your study subjects." And she said, "They have names. They're they have personalities. They have names." She broke all the rules. And and so I grew up with Jane as sort of this historical figure, but she was still like a living historical figure. And so then when I when I when I actually met her, it was so incredible because I I met her at a talk that she had given. And this this informed the rest of my life. The the the grace and wisdom that she showed changed me as a person because I met her at a talk that she was giving in New York City. And I had printed out a couple of chapters. I'd printed out one of the chapters that became my first book where I'm taking care of a baby giant anteater.

</details>

**保罗**: 我打印了一章，我和**JJ**在寻找我们的第一条**森蚺**，就是这个故事。我把这些和一封简单的附信放在一起，信上写着：“嘿，我热爱野生动物。我在亚马逊工作了大约5年，你一直是我的灵感来源。如果我写一本书，你会为它背书吗？”于是我把这个放在一个牛皮纸信封里递给她，当时有500人在排队，你知道，我们拍照，她说谢谢你。她把它放在一边，我说好吧，我知道我尽力了。48小时后，她的团队联系了我，说**珍**读了这些材料。她读了那些章节，她认为它们很棒，如果你找到出版商，告诉他们**珍**会为你的书背书。所以后来我去找出版商，我说我有**珍·古道尔**的背书，他们说那基本上就是**大地之母**本人了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And I had printed out a chapter where me and JJ were looking for our first anaconda, this story. And I put those together with a little covered letter that's just said, "Hey, I love wildlife. I've been working in the Amazon for like 5 years and you've always been an inspiration to me. If I write a book, would you endorse it?" And so I gave this to her in the manila envelope while there was a line of 500 people and you know we you take the picture and she said thank you very much. She puts it aside and I said all right you know I tried my best and 48 hours later her her team reached out and said Jane read the material. She read the chapters and she thinks that they're wonderful and if you find a publisher let them know that Jane will endorse your book. And so then I went to the publishers and I said I have the endorsement of Jane Goodall and they said well that's basically Mother Earth herself. Mhm.

</details>

**保罗**: 他们说：“所以，这就是让我凭借我的第一本书成为作家的敲门砖，是**珍**。你知道，她是环保界的巨人，这位传奇人物。首先，对于一个每年有300天在路上的人来说，她是一个科学、环保和希望的象征。她能有这样的心智、耐心和责任感，去阅读一个孩子递给她的东西，这真是不可思议。对我来说，即使是今天，那也是魔法。它对我意义重大，至今仍在影响我的行为方式。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And they said, "So, so that's what got me in the door to become an author with my first book was Jane. You know, she's she was this titan of conservation, this legendary figure. And her just first of all, for someone that was on the road 300 days a year, that's an icon of science and conservation and hope. For her to have the presence of mind and the patience and the sense of responsibility to actually read something that some kid handed her, that's incredible. That's magic to me even to this day. And it and it matters to me and it informs how I act even to this day.

</details>

**保罗**: 但如果没有**珍**向我挥舞她的魔杖，我就不会有事业。就不会有保罗，就不会有**Jungle Keepers**，就不会有书。我们今天就不会坐在这里。**珍·古道尔**救了我的命。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: But without Jane sort of waving her wand in my direction, I would have no career. There would be no Paul, no Jungle Keepers, no book. We wouldn't be sitting at this desk today. Jane Goodall saved my life.

</details>

**主持人**: 她是一位标志性的科学家，正如你所说，以对**黑猩猩**的开创性研究以及她在环保方面的全球工作而闻名。所以你决定要被**森蚺**吃掉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: She's an iconic scientist, as you say, um known for groundbreaking research on chimpanzees and her work generally and globally on on conservation. Um, so you you decide that you're going to be eaten by an anaconda.

</details>

**保罗**: 哦，是的。那是个题外话。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Oh, yeah. That was a tangent. Yes.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么，这是一条野生森蚺，还是被圈养的森蚺？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So, is this a wild anaconda or is this an anaconda held in captivity?

</details>

**主持人**: 你是怎么让森蚺吃掉你的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How did you get the anaconda to eat you?

</details>

**保罗**: 让我看看下一张照片。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: So, let me see that next one on the picture.

</details>

**主持人**: 这张？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: This one?

</details>

**保罗**: 是的。这条蛇叫**埃莉诺**。我们以我亲爱的祖母的名字命名她，她是一位了不起的女性，也是我们家族的女族长。**埃莉诺**是当时有史以来测量到的最大蛇，经过验证，科学测量。她长18英尺6英寸，重100多公斤。她当时很瘦。她有一段时间没吃东西了。但想象一下，如果她吃了一只**水豚**，她就会有200公斤重。但我的团队在拍摄这个节目时抓到了她。再次强调，我们被告知节目会叫做《**亚马逊远征**》。拍摄单上写着“远征EA”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Yeah. This is a snake called Eleanor. And we we named her this after my dear grandmother, who was an incredible woman and uh and uh the matriarch of our family. Now, Eleanor is the largest snake ever measured at the time, verifiably, scientifically measured. She was 18' 6 in and over over 100 kilos. And she was skinny. She hadn't eaten in a while. But imagine if she'd eaten a Cappy bar, she would have been, you know, 200 kilos. But um my team caught her while we were filming this show. And again, we were told the show would be called Expedition Amazon. The call sheet said expedition EA.

</details>

**保罗**: 然后当我们完成亚马逊的研究后，他们说：“看，飞到，我忘了是**肯塔基州**还是**路易斯安那州**。”他们说：“飞到某个州。那里有一个人带着一条蛇。没有人会知道区别。我们会模糊处理。”他们说：“做这个小特技。”我说：“我们会在节目最后五分钟放进去，只是为了向人们展示，然后，你知道，我们会在新闻中大肆宣传。”他们说：“我们搞定了。”很多握手，对吧？在我本该上**《早安美国》**节目之前一天，和**马特·劳尔**先生一起，他因为我在片场做俯卧撑而生我的气。在我本该上节目的前一天，我又在这里了。我还是个孩子，我想，我想我们成功了。我想我们做到了。我们抓到了有史以来最大的蛇。我们抓到那条蛇的画面简直是疯了。我们都跳进河里，和这只**海妖**搏斗，我们抓到了这条蛇，并从她身上学到了很多。我们当时，听起来很疯狂，但我们正在开发研究这个物种的野外方法，我们学到了关于**森蚺**的各种事情，因为我们给她喂了一个**发射器**。我们了解了她如何在环境中移动。这是以前从未做过的研究。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Then when we were done doing our research in the Amazon, they said, "Look, fly to I forget if it was like Kentucky or Louisiana." They said, "L fly to some state. There's a guy with a snake. No one will know the difference. We'll blur it out." And they said, "Do this little stunt." I said, "We'll put it the last five minutes of the show just to show people and then we'll, you know, we'll hype it up in the news." They're like, "We got you." A lot of handshakes, right? And the day before I was supposed to go on the Good Morning America show with uh Mr. Matt Lowauour, who got mad at me for doing push-ups on the set. Um, the the day before I was supposed to go on the show, I'm here again. I'm a kid and I'm going, I I think I think we got it. I think we did it. We caught the biggest snake ever. The footage of us catching that snake is insane. We're all jumping in the river and wrestling this kraken and we catch this snake and we learned from her. We did, we were, it sounds crazy, but we were developing field methodology for studying the species and we learned all kinds of things about anacondas because we fed her a transmitter. learned how she moves through the environment. This is research that had never been done before.

</details>

**主持人**: 就背景而言，给她喂食发射器是把一个电子设备。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: For context, feeding her a transmitter is putting a trans an electrical device

</details>

**保罗**: 基本上是放在她喉咙里，她吃下去，它会一直留在她体内直到她死去。所以你可以看到她在做什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: basically in her throat that she eats, she consumes, and it stays with her till she dies. So, you can see what she's doing.

</details>

**保罗**: 它会一直留在她体内，直到她排泄出来，对蛇来说，谢天谢地，这需要几个月。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: It stays with her until she defecates it, which for snakes that thankfully is months.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Okay?

</details>

**保罗**: 所以我们正在做这项开创性的研究。我们抓到了这条巨大的蛇。我们在亚马逊度过了六周的探险，幸存了下来。我们有所有这些不可思议的片段。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And so, we're doing this groundbreaking research. We caught this tremendous snake. We' survived a six week expedition in the Amazon. We had all this incredible footage.

</details>

**保罗**: 在我本该上早间节目的前一晚，他们给我看了电影。里面没有任何科学内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And the night before I'm supposed to go out on the morning shows, they showed me the film. It had none of the science.

</details>

**保罗**: 里面没有任何我被承诺会有的环保信息。相反，他们把重点放在了最后的特技上。他们把节目名称改成了《**活吞**》。然后他们让我出门去参加节目。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: It had none of the conservation message that I was promised would be in the show. And instead, they focused on the stunt at the end. And they changed the name of the show to eaten alive. And then they sent me out the door to do the shows.

</details>

**保罗**: 公众很生气，因为我没有真的被吃掉，他们觉得被骗了。**PETA**很生气，因为他们觉得我以某种方式危及了蛇的生命。动物权利保护者非常愤怒。然后科学家们也很生气，因为他们说：“好吧，你只是一个，你知道，一个哗众取宠的人。你只是为了刺激，你并不是真正的环保主义者。”所以这让我失业了好几年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And the public was mad because I didn't actually get eaten and they felt like they were lied to. PETA was mad because they felt like I had put a a snake's life in danger somehow. Somehow somehow the animal rights people were furious. And then the scientists were mad because they said, "Okay, you're just a you know a a shock person. You're just in in this for the thrill and you're not really a conservationist." So it put me out of work for years.

</details>

**主持人**: 真的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Really?

</details>

**保罗**: 是的。这让我倒退了大约10年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Yes. It set me back about 10 years.

</details>

**主持人**: 真的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Really?

</details>

**保罗**: 我尝试过，我冒了很大的风险，因为我以为那会帮助我的森林，结果我撞到了天花板，重重摔了下来。第二天新闻，我是说，所有深夜节目都在嘲笑这件事。**吉米·坎摩尔**说：“你下一个特技应该尝试和**河马**做爱。”我是说，人们的评论简直是，我去了**印度**，和一群大象生活了一段时间。我是说，我必须离开。我简直不能。我说我的环保主义者梦想结束了。一位著名的环保主义者甚至告诉我不要去南美洲。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: I tried I took a big swing because I thought it would help my forest and I hit my head on the ceiling and fell down hard. The next day the news I mean you know all of the late night shows were making fun of it. Jimmy Kimmel was like you for your next stunt you should try having sex with a hippo. I mean people the comments were just I went to India and lived with the herd of elephants for a while. I mean I had to get out. I couldn't I literally couldn't. I said my dream of being a conservationist is over. I was told by one prominent conservationist not even to come to South America.

</details>

**保罗**: 再次强调，你必须记住，在所有这些过程中，在赤脚砍刀的日子里，在去亚马逊的旅程中，我20年旅程的前15年，我没有任何支持。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And and again, the thing you have to remember through all of this is through the barefoot machete days, through going to the Amazon, the first 15 years of my 20-year journey, I had no support.

</details>

**保罗**: 所以，我背着背包，住在亚马逊的船上，赤脚，没有薪水，没有医疗保险，没有安全保障，没有前进的道路。嗯，所以那是非常不确定的时期。你知道，我想可能是在你的节目上，有一句很棒的话，我想是**亚历克斯·霍尔莫西**说的，他说信心来自于给人无可辩驳的证据，证明你就是你所说的那个人。当我听到那句话时，我觉得很棒。然后我接着想，好吧，但你必须开始朝着一个方向建立那个证据。对于很多人来说，我想他们发现自己站在一座高山上，看着一系列山脉，你必须选择你要走向哪个方向。对我来说，我是一个高中辍学生，永远不会成为一名**环保生物学家**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: So, I was living out of a backpack, living out of a boat in the Amazon barefoot with no paycheck, no health insurance, no security, no pathway forward. Um, so it it was it was very uncertain times. You know that you actually I think it may have been on your show. There's this great quote where I think it was Alex Hormosi was saying that confidence comes from giving people irrefutable proof that you are who you say you are. And when I heard that quote I thought that's great. And then the next thing I thought was well but you have to start building that proof in a direction. And for a lot of people, I think they find themselves standing on a high hill looking at a set of mountains and you have to choose which direction you're going in. And for me, I was a high school dropout who was never going to be a conservation biologist.

</details>

**保罗**: 我是由当地人训练的，被他们的部落收养了。所以我知道如何在丛林中生存，如何与蛇打交道，做所有这些疯狂的事情。我试图把这个信息带到电视上，结果我被**好莱坞**狠狠地教训了。我被骗了，被利用了。但那次失败最终成为发生在我身上最好的事情，因为它把我送回了原点。它说你还没准备好。所以有时你想要的东西并不是你需要的。这是一个美好的事情，生活会说：“我知道你想要那个，但我会给你你需要的，而不是你想要的。”所以这是一个我真的很难接受的例子。我是说，当时那是一次毁灭性的损失。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And I was trained by the local people and sort of adopted by their tribe. And so I knew how to survive in the jungle and work with snakes and do all these crazy things. And I tried I tried to to take that message to television and I got Hollywood hard. I got lied to and I got taken for a ride. But that failure ended up being the best thing that ever happened because what it did was it sent me right back to the drawing board. Said you're not ready yet. And so sometimes the things that you want are not the things that you need. And it's this beautiful thing where life sort of moves aside I know I know I know you want that but I'm I'm going to give you what you need, not what you want. And so this was a case where I really I took it hard. I mean, at the time it was a devastating loss

</details>

**保罗**: 那是发生在我身上最好的事情，因为它就像一记耳光，把我送回丛林，进行了多年的更多经验积累。加倍努力。你真正关心的是拯救森林吗？好吧，如果你关心拯救森林，你到底要怎么做？我们必须开发一个系统来做这件事。我们必须开发一种新技术来拯救森林。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: and it was the best thing that ever happened because it it was the slap on the head that sent me back out into the jungle for years and years and years of of more experience. Double down. What do you really care about saving the forest? Well, if you care about saving the forest, how the hell are you going to do that? And we had to develop a system to do that. We had to develop a new technology as a way to save the forest.

</details>

**主持人**: 这里到底发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What actually happened here?

</details>

**保罗**: 所以，我们没有，我知道你不想，你似乎不想谈论它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: So, we didn't I know you don't want to It sounds like you don't you don't don't want to talk about it.

</details>

**保罗**: 谈论它只是浪费时间，因为我们和一条16英尺长的**森蚺**在泥里打滚，什么也没发生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: It's just wasted air time to talk about it because we we rolled around on in the mud with a 16 ft anaconda and nothing happened.

</details>

**主持人**: 很多人可能想知道为什么什么也没发生。我想部分原因是你穿的衣服。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: A lot of people will probably want to know why nothing happened. And I think part of that is because of what you're wearing.

</details>

**保罗**: 不，什么也没发生的原因是他们有**驯蛇师**在我穿着这件可笑的衣服时把蛇缠绕在我身上。我是说，我为了保护这片森林会做任何事。那条蛇，如果它被放任不管，它会爬走。任何蛇都会，如果我手里现在有一条**黑曼巴蛇**，我把它放在这张桌子上，它会滑下桌子，找到房间里最暗的地方躲起来。如果我有一条**喷毒眼镜蛇**，也是一样。没有蛇想和你打交道。它们只想躲起来。它们想回去睡觉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: No, the reason nothing happened is because they had snake handlers wrapping the snake around me while I was in this ridiculous suit. Um, I mean, the things I will do, the things I will do to protect this forest, that snake, if it was left on its own, would crawl off. Any snake would would, if there was, if I had a black mamba in my hands right now and I put it on this table, it would slide off the table and find the darkest spot in the room and it would go hide. If I had a spitting cobra, same thing. No snake wants to deal with you. They just want to go hide. They want to go back to sleep.

</details>

**主持人**: 大多数人害怕蛇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Most people are terrified of snakes.

</details>

**保罗**: 大多数人害怕蛇。这就是为什么我认为你会喜欢我为你准备的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Most people are terrified of snakes. And that's why I think you're going to like what I have for you.

</details>

**主持人**: 你什么意思？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What do you mean?

</details>

**保罗**: 我今天带了一个朋友来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: I brought a friend today.

</details>

**主持人**: 你带了一个朋友？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You brought a friend?

</details>

**保罗**: 我确实带了一个朋友，我想让你见见他。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: I did bring a friend and I want you to meet him.

</details>

### 与蛇共舞：克服恐惧与理解自然

**保罗**: 这是一条非常非常小的**球蟒**。这是一个婴儿。当我让人们第一次见到小蛇时，我试图让他们明白的第一件事是，即使你害怕蛇，你也是大型顶级捕食者。而这只是一条独自生活在这个世界上的小爬行动物。它们出生后就必须自食其力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Now, this is a very, very small ball python. This is a baby. And one of the first things I try to impress upon people when they meet a baby snake is remembering that even if you're scared of snakes, you're the large apex predator. And this is just a tiny little reptile that is all alone in the world. They're born and they have to fend for themselves.

</details>

**保罗**: 出于某种原因，我从小就对蛇着迷。我觉得它们很美。我喜欢它们移动的方式。我喜欢它们能撑起身体，吐出舌头的方式。我觉得蛇很平静，很美丽，很迷人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And for some reason, ever since I was a little kid, I was fascinated with snakes. I thought they were beautiful. I love the way they moved. I thought the way they can hold up their bodies and flick their tongues. I find snakes calming and beautiful and fascinating.

</details>

**主持人**: 那条蛇危险吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Is that snake dangerous?

</details>

**保罗**: 你可以把这条蛇交给一个婴儿。这条蛇非常无害。我是说，如果我掐她一下，伤害她，她最坏也只是咬我一口，但那几乎不会破皮。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: You could hand this snake to a baby. This snake is so harmless. I mean, the worst thing that this snake could do if I was to, let's just say, pinch her and hurt her. She could bite me, but even that would barely break my skin.

</details>

**保罗**: 这条蛇会寻找小老鼠、小鸟，也许还有青蛙，并试图长得更大。你以前抱过蛇吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: This is a snake that's going to look for baby mice, little birds, maybe a frog, and try and grow to a larger size. Now, have you ever held a snake before?

</details>

**主持人**: 没有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: No.

</details>

**保罗**: 你从没抱过蛇？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: You've never held a snake?

</details>

**主持人**: 我不觉得。没有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I don't think so. No.

</details>

**保罗**: 哦，哇。那太棒了。这是一个非常容易上手的，我会给你一些提示。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Oh, wow. That's wonderful. Well, this is such an easy one to start with, and I'll give you a few pointers.

</details>

**主持人**: 我的手都出汗了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: My hands are sweating over.

</details>

**保罗**: 所以有几点是，即使是一条小蛇，也会稍微解读你的内在状态。如果你非常紧张和不安，蛇会察觉到。但你看她是如何适应我的手的。是的，她在这里做了一些事情。她找到了她的锚点。她的尾巴缠绕在这两根手指上。接下来，她正在吐舌头感知周围发生的一切。她在四处张望，但她并不兴奋。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: So, a few things is that even a baby baby snake is going to interpret your inner state a little bit. if you're very nervous and jittery and the snake is gonna pick up on that. But you see how she's sort of just fitting to my hand. Yeah, she's done a few things here. She's got her anchor. She's got her tail around these two fingers. And the next thing is she's flicking her tongue to sense what's going on. She's she's looking around, but she's also she's not excited.

</details>

**主持人**: 她不介意汗水。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: She doesn't mind sweat.

</details>

**保罗**: 她不介意汗水。我的手也出很多汗。所以我要轻轻地把她放在你的手里。你想要做的是让她抓住。你现在感觉如何？我们看看她会怎么做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: She doesn't mind sweat. My hands sweat quite a bit as well. And so I'm just going to place her in your hand nice and easy. And what you want to do is let her sort of grab on now. Now, what are you feeling right now? Let's just see what she does.

</details>

**主持人**: 我感觉有点紧张。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I feel a little bit tense.

</details>

**保罗**: 没关系。你可以感到紧张。现在，如果你感到紧张，她可能会回到我身边，因为她可能知道我爱她。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: That's okay. You can feel tense. Now, if you feel tense, the thing is she's probably going to return to me because she probably knows I love her.

</details>

**主持人**: 我觉得她是对的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I think she's right.

</details>

**保罗**: 是的。那没关系。我们让她那样做吧。然后你就能感受到她是如何移动的。我要给她一个爬过去的小洞，像这样。所以它们有这些肌肉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Yeah. And that's okay. Why don't we just let her do that? And then you can get a sense for how she moves. And I'm going to give her a little hole to crawl through like that. And so what they do is they have all these muscles

</details>

**保罗**: 沿着身体运动，你能感觉到，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: running along their body and you can feel that, right?

</details>

**主持人**: 我不得不说，真是美丽的动物。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Such a beautiful animal, I do have to say.

</details>

**保罗**: 是的。它们被称为**球蟒**。它们也因为那美丽的黑色和金色而被叫做**皇家蟒**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Yeah. They're called ball pythons. They also call them royal pythons for that that beautiful black and gold.

</details>

**主持人**: 我能用拇指摸它吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It's Can I Can I touch it with my thumb?

</details>

**保罗**: 你可以。它们不喜欢被抚摸。这是关于蛇的一点。它们不喜欢。很多人突然喜欢蛇时，他们会说：“我想像摸狗一样摸它。”蛇会因此退缩。所以如果你摸它，用你的拇指摸她。看她是怎么躲开的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: You can. They don't love being pet. That's one thing about snakes. They don't A lot of people when they come around to suddenly loving snakes, they go, "Well, I want to pet it the way I want to pet a dog." And snakes will retract from that. So if you do it, touch her with your with your thumb. See how she moves away?

</details>

**主持人**: 她躲开了。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: She moved away. Yeah,

</details>

**保罗**: 她躲开了。她不喜欢那样。所以通常对于蛇，我的规矩是你要像一棵树。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: she moves away. She doesn't like that. So usually with snakes, my my my rule is you you sort of have to be the be the tree.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。她是个婴儿吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Okay. And is she a baby?

</details>

**保罗**: 绝对是。这些都非常小。所以在丛林里寒冷的日子，我会发现这样的蛇，然后真的把它们放在手里暖和。我会把它们放在这里。如果你能看看那个。看看她多可爱。她就会那样待着。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Absolutely. These are these this is quite small. And so in the jungle on cold days, I'll find snakes like this and literally warm them up in my hands. I'll put them in here. And just if you can just look at that. Just look at how sweet she is. She'll just stay like that.

</details>

**主持人**: 她喜欢那样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: She likes that.

</details>

**保罗**: 她喜欢那样。她喜欢那里的温暖。我们是恒温动物。它们是变温动物。像所有爬行动物一样，它们的体温取决于环境。所以在寒冷的日子里，看到那个了吗？看到那个了吗？我把手移近。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: She likes that. She likes that. She likes the warmth there. We are endtherms. They are ectotherms. Like all reptiles, they depend on their environment for their body temperature. And so on the cold days, see that? See that? I move my hand closer.

</details>

**主持人**: 她有点受惊了。她又回去了。再次强调，这只是一个小小婴儿。还有另一个同样很棒的例子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: She got a little spooked. She went back into the Again, this is just a tiny baby. There's another one that is a similarly awesome example.

</details>

**保罗**: 这是她体型较大的亲戚。同一种物种，对吧？所以这是一条小**球蟒**，这是一条大球蟒。注意这两条都没有风险，对吧？这里没有危险。我不是说我不能把它们靠近我的脸。再次强调，这两条都像是蛇中的**金毛寻回犬**。这些蛇都是由负责任的养蛇人饲养的。那么，那条小蛇会变成大蛇吗？还是说它们是同一种类的表亲？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: This is her larger relative. Same species, right? So, this is a small ball python and this is a larger ball python. And notice that both of these, there's no risk, right? There's no there's no danger here. It's not like I can't put these near my face. Again, both of these are sort of the golden retrievers of snakes. These are these are snakes that have been handled by responsible snake owners. So, will that small one grow into the big one or you saying they're the same sort of cousins?

</details>

**保罗**: 是的，这是一条大**球蟒**。这是一条小球蟒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Yeah, this is a larger ball python. This is a smaller ball python.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以这条最终会达到那个大小。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So, this one will eventually be the size.

</details>

**保罗**: 绝对会。这条可以长到那个大小的两倍。真的吗？我见过球蟒长到那个大小的两倍。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Absolutely. And this one could could grow to be double that size. Really? I've seen ball pythons be double that size.

</details>

**保罗**: 现在，这条。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Now, this one

</details>

**保罗**: 拿起来的方式有点不同。但你看，像这样。看看谁害怕了。我。嗯，还有他。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: slightly different game for holding. But see, like that. Look who's scared here. Me. Well, and and him.

</details>

**保罗**: 所以，看那个。他很美。所以，看，我只是让你感受一下**蟒蛇**的力量。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And so, look at that. He's beautiful. So, look, I'll just give you a sense of look at the power in a python.

</details>

**保罗**: 你觉得引体向上很难。他没有任何腿，没有爪子，只靠力量支撑着。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: You think pull-ups are hard. He's holding on with no no legs, no claws, just strength.

</details>

**保罗**: 他会爬回我的手臂上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And he's just going to climb back up on onto my arm.

</details>

**保罗**: 所以，我想让你做的是伸出你的手腕。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: So, what I'd like you to do is hold out your wrist.

</details>

**保罗**: 是的，你行的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Yeah, you got this.

</details>

**保罗**: 就这样横过桌子。拿着它。就像那样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Just straight across the table. Hold that. Right like that.

</details>

**主持人**: 现在，记住，如果他咬了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Now, remember, if he does bite,

</details>

**保罗**: 你是说如果他不。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: you mean if he doesn't

</details>

**主持人**: 我开玩笑的。我开玩笑的。只是把他举高一点，不要碰到桌子。是的。然后我只是要引诱他上来。他没事。你没事。你没事。你没事。好了。好了。所以他只是会感受到那种力量，当他移动时，他最终会移动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Just hold him up high enough that he's not touching the table. Yeah. And then I'm just going to coax him up. He's okay. You're okay. You're okay. You're all right. You're all right. There we go. There we go. So, he's just gonna just just feel that power as he moves, which he will eventually.

</details>

**保罗**: 但你看，你能感受到这条蛇的力量。它有点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: But, see, you can feel the power on this snake. It's a little bit more of a

**主持人**: 肌肉更发达。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: a little bit more musculature.

</details>

**主持人**: 它们真漂亮。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: They are stunning.

</details>

**保罗**: 你看到了吗？就是这样。他就像：“好吧，酷。你把我抱在这里。”它们是非常放松的动物。所以他会去吃一些小猎物，然后回到他的洞穴，消化一周，然后再出去。现在你。现在，如果你想，你可以用另一只手托住他。然后他会开始在你的两只手上移动。你试试看？轻轻地把你的另一只手放在他的缠绕处下面。他被吓到了。没关系。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: You see that? That's it. He's like, "Okay, cool. You're holding me here." They're pretty relaxed animals. So, he'll go and eat a small prey item, go back into his burrow, and then digest for a week before going back out. And now you Now, if you want, you can take your other hand and put it under him to support him. And then he'll start to move over both of your hands. Why don't you try that? Put your other hand very gently right under his coil right there. He got scared of that. That's okay.

</details>

**保罗**: 或者你可以把拇指穿过那个环。

<details>

**保罗**: 这又是一个不同的故事了。这大概是我们能找到的最接近**森蚺**的蛇了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: This is a different story. And this is sort of the closest thing that we're going to get to an anaconda.

</details>

**保罗**: 我想我能做的最简单的事情就是让她缠绕在我的脖子上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: I think the easiest thing I could do here is just let her get around my neck.

</details>

**主持人**: 我的生活到底怎么了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What the [ __ ] is my life?

</details>

**保罗**: 所以现在你不想让蛇做的是缩小那个间隙，对吧？你不想让它们缠绕在你的脖子上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: So now what you don't want snakes to do is to close that gap, right? You don't want them to wrap around your neck.

</details>

**主持人**: 她能杀了你吗？她能。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Could she kill you? She could.

</details>

**主持人**: 那就别把它带过来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Then don't bring it over here.

</details>

**保罗**: 嗯，我想，我想你也想见她。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Well, I thought I thought you wanted to meet her, too.

</details>

**主持人**: 但是如果她对我做了什么呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: But what what if she does something to me?

</details>

**保罗**: 不，不。所以，这是一种不同类型的蛇。这是一条**缅甸蟒**。当你谈论大型绞杀蛇时，那些是小型绞杀蛇，**球蟒**。这是一种更大的绞杀蛇。缅甸蟒会变得很大。它们可以长到18英尺长。现在我想你真正会欣赏的是这些东西所拥有的力量，当你感受到那种力量时。现在不要动。是的。现在把你的手给她。用你的手抓住她。很好。非常好。现在伸出这只手。很好。就像那样。现在做一棵树。只做一棵树。太棒了。是的。你想往这边来吗，女孩？过来。她的尾巴很热。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: No, no. So, this is a different type of snake. This is a Burmese python. And when you talk about large constrictors, those are small constrictors, the the ball pythons. This is a larger constriction constrictor. And Burmese pythons get to be big. These can go up to 18 ft long. And now what I think you're going to really appreciate is the power that these things have when you feel that power. And now just don't move. Yeah. Now give her your hand. Take her take her with your hand. Good. Very good. Now hold this hand out. Good. Just like that. Now be the tree. Just be the tree. That's great. Yep. You want to come this way, girl? Come here.

**保罗**: 好的，现在她会移动到你的头后面。我只是想让你感受一下那条蛇的肌肉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Okay, now she's just going to move behind your head. And I just want you to feel the muscles of that snake.

</details>

**主持人**: 那是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What was that?

</details>

**保罗**: 哦，是的。那太棒了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Oh, yeah. That's great.

</details>

**主持人**: 她在嘶嘶叫吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Is she hissing?

</details>

**保罗**: 她在呼吸。那只是她在呼吸，因为她抓着。她是一条地栖蛇。她不是真正的树栖蛇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: She's breathing. That's just her breathing cuz she's holding on. She's a ground snake. She's not really a tree snake.

</details>

**保罗**: **缅甸蟒**能长到18英尺长。它们能捕食鹿。所以你现在肩上爬着的是这条美丽的**花岗岩缅甸蟒**。顺便说一句，你做得很好。你看起来很平静。呼吸。别忘了呼吸。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: Now, Burmese pythons, they grow to be 18t long. They can take down deer. And so what you have right now is this beautiful granite Burmese python crawling on your shoulders. And you're doing great, by the way. You look very calm. Breathe. Don't forget to breathe.

</details>

**主持人**: 她能杀死一只鹿。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And she can kill a deer.

</details>

**保罗**: 不，不，她会长大。她还小。她还小。她最终会能够杀死一只鹿。现在我只是不想让她那样做。现在，事情是这样的。我想她喜欢你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: No, no, she'll grow. She's still a baby. She's still small. She'll eventually be able to kill a deer. Now I just I don't want her to. Now, here's the thing. I think she likes you.

</details>

**保罗**: 所以当我试图抓住她时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**保罗**: And so when I try to take her,

</details>

**主持人**: 力量。
