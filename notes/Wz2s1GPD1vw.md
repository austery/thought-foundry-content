### 鲍威尔收到大陪审团传票

**Tracy Alloway**: 欢迎收听新一期的 **Odd Lots** 播客。我是 Tracy Alloway。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Hello and welcome to another episode of the Odd Lots podcast. I'm Tracy Alloway.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我是 Joe Weisenthal。Joe，我觉得我们现在才进入 2026 年大约 10 到 12 天，我们已经录制了多少期紧急节目了？这是第四期。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: And I'm Joe Weisenthal. Joe, I feel like we're what about 10 days, 12 days into 2026. And how many emergency episodes have we recorded so far? This is going to be our fourth.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 可怜的制作人们，而且这些事总是发生在周末。虽然遗憾，但我确信你是对的。从新闻行业的角度来看，现在确实不缺新闻流，这可能是件好事，但正如你所说，现在很难跟上节奏。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Our poor producers, you know, and they keep happening on weekends, too, which is not uh the big the big developments keep happening on weekends, but I think it's going to be a busy year for us. H sad, but I am sure you are correct. I mean from the news business perspective there's certainly no shortage of news flow and that can be a good thing but it is hard to keep up nowadays as you mentioned.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 没错。本周末的新闻是，**美联储**主席 **Jerome Powell**（鲍威尔）表示，中央银行已收到来自**司法部**（DOJ）的大陪审团传票，威胁要进行刑事起诉。这与美联储大楼的翻修有关，**特朗普**之前就对此有过微词。具体来说，这次潜在起诉的罪名似乎是鲍威尔在去年 6 月的国会证词中可能撒了谎。基本上，这是特朗普与美联储之争的又一次重大升级。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: So this is the second weekend of 2026 and the news this weekend is that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the central bank has been served with a grand jury subpoena from the DOJ threatening a criminal indictment. And this has to do with the renovation of a Federal Reserve building, which you know, Trump has made noises about before. Specifically, apparently the wrongdoing for this particular indictment or potential indictment is that Jerome Powell might have lied when he gave his congressional testimony back in I think it was June of last year. But basically, this is the next big escalation in the Trump versus Fed fight.

</details>

### 特朗普与美联储的冲突升级

**Tracy Alloway**: 没错。这里有几点很有趣。鲍威尔作为美联储主席本来就快离任了，尽管他可以留在理事会。现在人们在想，他是否会因为这件事而选择留下来。另一个元素是鲍威尔昨晚发表的视频和声明，这是他最直接的回应之一。他说这份传票实际上源于政府对**利率政策**的不满。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yes, exactly right. And I think there's a few interesting things here. I mean, obviously Jerome Powell is on his way out already as Fed chair, though he could stay on the board and that's interesting. And now I think there's people are thinking, well, maybe he's going to stick around more because of this. And then the other element too is what I would say is like one of the most direct statements in response. Yesterday evening, Jerome Powell put out a video and a statement in which he said that this uh subpoena is really about the administration's frustration with interest rate policy.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 鲍威尔在面对批评时一直非常外交辞令，从不评论各种指责。但这次是一个重大的决裂。正如我们的同事 Cameron Crise 所说，这是压死骆驼的最后一根稻草。他比任何其他公职人员都更直接地表示，这本质上是**勒索**、恐吓和暴徒行为。这与他过去谈论压力的方式完全不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: And of course, uh, Powell has been very diplomatic, uh, with all the criticism, really not commenting at all about, um, all of the various critiques. We're just going to do our job. We're going to do the job for the American people, etc. Basically deflecting any questions on the politics surrounding, and this is a major break. Our uh, our colleague Cameron Crise, as he put it, this is the straw that broke the camel's back. And he's being more direct than almost anyone else in public service or government, etc., and saying this is essentially extortion, this is intimidation, this is thug behavior and this is not how he's talked about the pressure in the past.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 没错。我们需要讨论这一切意味着什么，以及它如何融入央行与特朗普政府之间持续的紧张关系。我们请来了 **Lev Menand**，他是**哥伦比亚大学法学院**教授，也是《**The Fed Unbound**》一书的作者。Lev，欢迎回到 Odd Lots。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Right? And if you watch the video, I mean, Powell has uh annoyed um grandpa that has had, you know, enough of all of this nonsense just written all over his face. Obviously, on a serious note, we need to talk about what all of this means, how it fits into the ongoing tensions between the central bank and the Trump administration. And who better, who's the man that we always call when this happens, Lev Menand. He is of course a professor at Columbia Law School and the author of the Fed Unbound. So, Lev, welcome back to the Odd Lots podcast.

</details>

**Lev Menand**: 谢谢邀请。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lev Menand**: Thanks for having me back.

</details>

### 刑事调查的史无前例性

**Joe Weisenthal**: 让我们先谈谈背景。很多人认为这种刑事起诉是央行与总统关系紧张史上的前所未有的升级。你认为这有多么反常？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: So, why don't we start with let's just put this in context. I've seen a lot of people talking about this kind of criminal indictment or you know possible criminal indictment as an unprecedented escalation in terms of central bank versus presidential tensions. I guess how unprecedented is this?

</details>

**Lev Menand**: 我认为这甚至超出了**央行独立性**的范畴。这是现任政府试图强行驱逐其认为的政治对手。这非常罕见，即使在过去一年的这届政府中也未曾见过。类似的类比可能是对查克·舒默或最高法院大法官进行刑事调查。鲍威尔是一名高级政府官员，政府已经明确表示希望他以不同的方式履行职责。现在他们基本上是在威胁，如果他不辞职或服从，就让他坐牢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lev Menand**: I think this is about more even at this point than um the central bank and central bank independence. This is an attempt by this administration to uh force out its perceived political opponents from the government. And so this is quite unprecedented. We haven't seen anything really quite like this even in this administration over the past year. you know, something analogous would be, you know, a criminal investigation of Chuck Schumer or Hakeem Jeffries or, you know, a Supreme Court justice. J Powell is a senior government official and um the administration's made quite clear uh that it would like him to carry out his duties differently from how he is doing it. And now they are basically threatening to throw him in jail if he doesn't step down or comply.

</details>

**Lev Menand**: 这是一个非常重大的升级，与去年夏天政府试图撤换包括鲍威尔在内的理事会成员的行为在性质上是不同的。这是一项**刑事调查**，涉及的问题远超美联储本身。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lev Menand**: And so this is a very very significant escalation that is different in kind even from what we saw over the summer where the administration was sort of pursuing potential removal actions against um various members of the board including Powell. This is a criminal investigation which I think I think is different in kind and and should be understood to be a very different set of issues that go that go well beyond the Fed itself.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 没错。虽然我们在谈论美联储独立性，比如总统能否解雇美联储主席，但这件事是平行的。这是关于犯罪指控。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Right? I think what's striking here is we're talking about this in the context of Fed independence questions, right? Can the president remove a uh Fed chair or a Fed governor, whatever? Can they be fired? But this is kind of separate because this isn't really there is this question and this question will all get to the Supreme Court at some point. But this is sort of like a a sideways thing or a parallel thing from that. This is about accusation of a crime.

</details>

### 法律战与美联储理事席位

**Lev Menand**: 没错。目前有多个法律程序正在进行。一个涉及 **Lisa Cook**。最高法院几天后就要对特朗普去年试图解雇她的行为是否合法进行口头辩论。目前法院让她留任，但特朗普仍在推动解雇。而针对鲍威尔的行动不同，特朗普目前并未尝试根据法规撤职，而是利用司法部进行恐吓，试图逼他下台。这威胁到了他的自由，不仅仅是丢掉工作，而是可能坐牢。在美国央行历史上，我找不到任何类似的先例。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lev Menand**: Yeah. Exactly. And so there are now multiple different sort of legal proceedings underway involving the administration's effort to basically cow the Federal Reserve into submission and also sort of get to a four vote majority on the board of governors. One dispute involves Lisa Cook. And incidentally, we're just days away from Supreme Court oral argument in the dispute over whether President Trump's efforts to terminate Lisa Cook, you know, last year were legally adequate. Right now, the courts have kept her in her job. So, he was not actually able to fire her. Uh, but he's still moving to do it. And the Supreme Court's going to weigh in on whether he can in a matter of days. This is not a similar action against Powell. Trump has not at this point attempted to remove him from office under the statute. This is an attempt to basically bully him out of office um using the Department of Justice, which is a very different thing. Um you know that his his liberty is is threatened. You know, it's not just that he could lose his job, it's that he could go to jail. And I can't think of any analog in the history uh of the US central bank or any you know US agency to this sort of action by an administration against a member of the government an official in the government.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我们该如何看待时机？鲍威尔本来就快离任了，新主席很快就会上任。在鲍威尔即将离开时对他发起刑事诉讼，在影响美联储政策方面似乎说不通，但也许在你提到的“寻求报复”方面很有意义？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: So how should we actually think about the timing of all of this? Because I mean you know everyone knows Powell is on his way out anyway. uh it's not that long until we're going to have a new Fed chair. So, the idea of going after him with a potential criminal proceeding when, you know, pretty soon he's not going to be there anyway doesn't necessarily make much sense in terms of influencing actual Fed policy. But maybe it makes a lot of uh sense to your earlier point about seeking revenge against people who are perceived to...

</details>

**Lev Menand**: 我认为几件事在同时发生。鲍威尔的主席任期到 5 月结束，特朗普想提前替换他。此外，鲍威尔作为**理事**的任期要到 2028 年。如果他不辞去理事职务，特朗普就无法提名自己的人选。美联储理事的 14 年任期是为了防止总统迅速控制理事会。如果能诱使这些理事提前辞职，总统就能安插自己的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lev Menand**: This is about things at once. I think that's right. One is that Powell is still serving as chair and his term runs until May and Trump has been clear that he would like to replace Powell as chair and that he has in fact identified who he wants in that job. And so on one level, this may be about getting Powell to step down before May so that he can be replaced, you know, months earlier. Powell is also serving a term as governor. That term runs until 2028. And if Powell were to choose to stay on the board, not to resign as governor um when his chair term expires, that would take a seat that Trump would otherwise be able to nominate um someone to fill. And that is relevant because uh the board at the beginning of Trump's term had seven governors on it. And those governors have 14-year terms that are staggered every two years designed to prevent a president from being able to quickly take control of the board with their own appointees. But if a lot of those governors can be induced to resign early, then the president can put um you know his or her own people in.

</details>

**Lev Menand**: 但更重要的是，鲍威尔作为一个不愿屈服的高级官员，被当作了“杀鸡儆猴”的例子，让整个政府系统的人看到违抗行政当局的后果。这关乎一个人们普遍畏惧白宫的政府动态。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lev Menand**: But I also think it's worth recognizing that there's something going on that's um um um bigger than the Fed here. That's about Jerome Powell as a high-profile prominent government official who has not bent the knee um being made an example of so that everybody else on the board of governors and throughout the US government can see um what could happen to you if you uh defy the administration and that's why I feel the stakes for this are actually quite high and it's about the larger dynamic of what happens in a government where people are scared of the White House.

</details>

### 法律辩护的个人成本

**Joe Weisenthal**: 提到法律程序，根据《华尔街日报》的报道，鲍威尔已经自费聘请了 **Williams & Connolly** 律师事务所。鲍威尔很富有，他雇得起顶级律师。但法律对于谁来支付这些辩护费用是怎么规定的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Right? I think what's striking here is... according to uh Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal, uh Jerome Powell had already hired the firm Williams and Connelly on his own dime. Powell's a rich guy, successful businessman, lawyer. He can afford to hire great lawyers and he's going to have to defend himself. How does that work though? What does the law say about who has to pay for these things?

</details>

**Lev Menand**: 法律不允许机构为此支付费用。官员必须自担。美联储理事会的法律人员不能在司法部发起的诉讼或总统发起的撤职行动中代表鲍威尔。这需要聘请私人律师。这正是风险所在——它会吓跑想要进入政府服务的人，并导致辞职。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lev Menand**: Yeah, the law does not permit the agencies to to pay for this in any way. And so the officials are on their own. The legal staff at the board of governors cannot represent Powell in a proceeding um being brought against him by the Justice Department. They can't represent him in a removal action by the president. And so these matters require you to hire your own counsel. This is part of why the stakes of this are quite high. This sort of thing scares people away from government service and and leads to resignations.

</details>

**Lev Menand**: 去年夏天，**Cuddler** 理事在任期结束前 6 个月突然辞职，现在公开信息显示她当时也在接受调查。当美国联邦政府全力对付个人时，很少有人能负担得起反击的费用。很多人会因为恐惧而改变行为，以避免引起白宫的关注。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lev Menand**: recall over the summer that, you know, Governor Cuddler resigned abruptly and without explanation 6 months before the end of her term and I think there's a fair amount of information in the public domain now that she was also being investigated. And so part of the story here is all of the sort of bullying that doesn't have to happen because people, you know, on their own change their behavior to avoid drawing the eye of the White House.

</details>

### 市场反应为何平淡

**Tracy Alloway**: 尽管我们已经担心了一年美联储的独立性，以及特朗普可能在不当的时机推动降息，但市场反应似乎相对平淡。股市下跌，收益率小幅上升，但并没有出现恐慌。为什么评论界非常担心，而短期市场行动却存在脱节？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: So, Lev, I know you're not sat in front of a Bloomberg terminal right now, but Joe and I both are. And the market reaction has been, you know, negative. So, we've seen stocks are down. Um yields are up a little bit. Uh gold has been rising, but we haven't seen, you know, panic in the market. What accounts for maybe the disconnect between some of the commentary which is very worried about the future direction of independence versus the actual short-term market action.

</details>

**Lev Menand**: 我认为市场定价这种非线性制度变革的方式就像破产一样：起初很缓慢，然后突然发生。只要理事会实际上仍由非特朗普任命的人控制，你就不会看到太大的市场反应。但如果达到临界点，反应会非常迅速且剧烈。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lev Menand**: I think that the way the market prices this sort of potential nonlinearity sort of regime change in our you know monetary and financial architecture is it's it's a bit like what they say about bankruptcy. It happened gradually and then suddenly. I think that as long as the board continues to in fact be controlled by non-Trump appointees, you're not going to see a lot of market pricing reaction. But if and when we we could reach a sort of tipping point where there's a sort of rapid and dramatic negative reaction.

</details>

**Lev Menand**: 此外，美联储是一个非常强大的机构，拥有许多其他职责，这些职责可能会被武器化。例如，整个**支付系统**和金融基础设施支柱都运行在美联储之上。将这些基础设施交给愿意滥用它的人是非常危险的，但这不一定会立即改变美元的价值。因此，我们不应仅根据长期债券的波动来衡量我们的担忧程度。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lev Menand**: The central bank is a very powerful organization that carries out a lot of other responsibilities which could potentially be weaponized, you know, by a board in control of the White House that would have no effect on the value of the dollar. um you know uh the whole payments system the sort of financial infrastructure backbone runs through the Federal Reserve and putting that infrastructure in the hands of an actor that's willing to abuse it is very very dangerous but isn't going to change the value of the dollar.

</details>

### 银行监管即货币政策

**Joe Weisenthal**: 有人认为美联储的货币职能（FOMC 利率设置）应受国会管辖，而监管职能属于行政分支。这两者能分得开吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: setting aside precedent or whatever you know I think you could make a really good argument that the monetary functions of the Federal Reserve, the FOMC, the rate setting committee, that's under the purview of Congress. On the other hand, you know, I think you could the supervisory stuff you'd say, well, this is executive branch stuff. How interlinked are these two functions?

</details>

**Lev Menand**: 这是一个非常深刻的问题。我的观点是，**货币政策就是银行监管**，反之亦然。在 21 世纪，货币供应是由摩根大通、美国银行等投资者拥有的银行创造的。美联储执行货币政策时，是在改变这些银行扩张或收缩资产负债表的动机和约束。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lev Menand**: is a very deep question. My view on this is that monetary policy is bank regulation and vice versa. That the money supply in the 21st century is created by investor-owned banks JP Morgan, Bank of America. They're the ones actually issuing the money in circulation that people are using. What the Federal Reserve is doing when it conducts monetary policy is changing the incentives and constraints on the collective balance sheet of the banking system to expand and contract.

</details>

**Lev Menand**: 虽然我们选择隔夜利率作为主要工具，但资本要求、流动性要求和监管预期都会影响货币供应。认为我们可以拆分这些功能，让一个不影响宏观经济条件的银行监管机构独立存在，是异想天开的。如果你把监管权交给白宫，只把利率权留在独立机构，这两者之间会发生激烈的斗争。底线是：货币是由银行发行的，因此银行监管者从根本上参与了广义的货币政策。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Lev Menand**: And the main way we adjust those constraints is through the overnight interest rate. But obviously capital requirements, liquidity requirements, supervisory expectations all have an influence on the the balance sheet of the banking system and the rate at which it expands and contracts. And so the idea that we could um split these functions and that we would just have this bank regulator that isn't you know affecting macroeconomic conditions is fanciful. You would not achieve that if you handed over to the White House regulatory and supervisory policy uh and left in an independent agency just the overnight interest rate policy. Uh you'd have quite a struggle between those two bodies. The bottom line point is the money supply is bank issued. So bank regulators are fundamentally involved in monetary policy broadly construed.

</details>

### 公职服务的寒蝉效应

**Tracy Alloway**: Lev，非常感谢你参加我们的节目。Joe，这次讨论太有意思了。在利率高企的环境下，利息支出占联邦政府支出的很大一部分，因此利率成为了政府行动的限制因素。特朗普攻击这个限制因素并不令人意外，但这种随机性和混乱感非常奇怪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: All right, Lev, thank you so much for coming back on Odd Lots. Joe, that was such an interesting discussion. Obviously, there's the short-term developments, but also the long-term meditations on the relationship between the Fed and the federal government. In a high interest rate environment, interest rate payments become a huge chunk of the federal government's spending. And so interest rates become much more of a constraint on what the US government can and actually cannot do. And so to some extent, I guess it's unsurprising that Trump would go after this as a limiting factor.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 没错。最让我震惊的是，当涉及到“坐牢”的念头时——让我们诚实点，潜在的刑事指控就是这个意思——你就进入了一个全新的领域。而且，人们必须自付律师费，这会对任何考虑担任公职的人产生巨大的**寒蝉效应**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Totally. I mean, I think the thing that really strikes me is that... when you bring in the thought of prison time, which let's be honest, that's what a potential criminal charge is, I mean, then you're striking at something much deeper. And also, the idea that people are going to have to pay their own legal fees for all of this is going to have a massive chilling effect on anyone who's even thinking about going into public office at this point.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 没错。我经常遇到一些非常有才华、有见地的人，但我问他们是否考虑过竞选公职时，没有一个正常人会说是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: right? And also, I mean, we talked about it, but the idea that people are going to have to pay their own legal fees for all of this is going to have a massive chilling effect on anyone um who's even thinking about going into public office at this point. I'm always disturbed by, you know, like I'll meet very impressive people from time to time. And I'm like, "Hey, you ever thought about running for office?" And no one ever says yes. Like no sane person.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的，这太疯狂了。我们现在选拔出来的基本上都是**反社会人格者**（sociopaths），我不确定一个由反社会者组成的政府能否产生最优政策。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah. It's just like you'd be so crazy to... we are truly selecting for you have to be a real sociopath basically and I don't know that a government of sociopaths is going to lead to optimal policy.

</details>
