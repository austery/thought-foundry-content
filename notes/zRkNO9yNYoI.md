title: 桥水基金格雷格·詹森：在现代重商主义与AI革命中的投资之道
---

### 塑造当今世界的三大主题

大家好，欢迎来到《In Good Company》。今天我请到了桥水基金的联席首席投资官格雷格·詹森。桥水基金是一家卓越的对冲基金，我们可以说是全球规模最大、最优秀的。格雷格，很荣幸能邀请你来到这里。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Hi everybody and welcome to In Good Company and today I'm here with Greg Yensen who is the co-CIO of Bridgewwater. Now Bridgewater is just an incredible hedge fund, the world largest and best I think we can say and it's an honor to have you here Greg.</p>
</details>

谢谢你的邀请。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thanks for having me.</p>
</details>

从最高层面来看，我目前关注或担忧的三大主题是：首先，全球及美国经济管理方式的变革。我们称之为向**现代重商主义**（Modern Mercantilism: 一种经济理论，强调通过政府干预，如设置关税和贸易壁垒，来最大化出口、最小化进口，以增强国家经济实力和地缘政治地位）的转变，这是对中国崛起的一种反应。它在整个西方世界引发了政治变革，在美国表现得尤为明显，催生了一套全新的经济治理哲学。所以，这是第一个大主题：现代重商主义，即美国在经济和地缘政治方面的运作方式发生了巨大变化，理解这一点至关重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, if I said sort of at the the biggest level, the three big themes that I'm concerned about or focused on are a the change in how the global and US economy uh is being managed. Essentially, what we call a shift to modern mercantalism that's been a reaction to China's rise. It's created political changes across the west mo probably most clearly in the US leading to a whole different philosophy on how to run the economy. So that's one big theme modern mercalism the way the US is operating both with respect to economics but also with respect to geopolitical conditions huge change really important to understand.</p>
</details>

第二个主题是我们正身处其中的技术变革。正如我们稍后会谈到的，我思考和应用人工智能已经有很长时间了，机器学习有15年，而更广泛地看，则贯穿我的整个职业生涯。我记得以前人们常问：“格雷格，你为什么总在谈论人工智能？”现在再也没人这么问了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second is the technological change that we're in the midst of. I've been as I'm sure we'll get into thinking about and and working with AI for a very long time now machine learning for 15 years and more generally my whole career and I remember people used to say um Greg why are you talking about AI all the time nobody says that anymore.</p>
</details>

最终被证明是正确的感觉很好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it's nice to be right at the end is</p>
</details>

嗯，一路走来也犯过很多错，有很多可以犯错的地方。但这件事之所以如此重要，是因为它占据了所有事情的三分之一到一半——地缘政治、市场，一切的一切。你必须理解它，才能理解宏观世界。第三，所有这一切都发生在一个资本比以往任何时候都更集中于美国、更集中于股权和非流动性资产的世界里。这构成了一种充满风险的格局。因此，理解资金流向何处、为何流向那里，以及这种状况改变的可能性有多大，这是我关注的第三点。这就是三大核心议题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well there's a lot of being wrong along the way plenty to be wrong about but the um but that that it it's so important right it's a third to half of everything geop politics, markets, everything you you have to understand it to understand the macro world. And um and third, that all is happening in a world where capital is more concentrated in the US than ever, more concentrated in equity and illquid assets. Um so a kind of risky setup. So understanding where money has flowed to, why it's flowed there, and how likely that is to change. Those are the big three headlines.</p>
</details>

### 解读现代重商主义及其对投资者的影响

向重商主义的转变对投资者意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, let's unpack um let's unpack them um one after the other. Um what are the implications for investors that we are moving towards mercantalism?</p>
</details>

这是一个巨大的转变，如果你还认为经济会按过去的方式运行，那就错了。这是一个非常重要的变化。回想1980年代，当时发生了一次重大转变，趋势是小政府、大量的资本主义和私营部门的自由。现在的情况则截然不同。由于中国的崛起，以及许多西方国家中产阶级的空心化，出现了一种政治反弹。这种反弹形式各异，但在世界其他地方，它表现为一种“特朗普式”的心态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Well, I think a it's it's a big shift if you're if you're thinking the economy works the way it used to work. It's it's a really important change, right? If you take there's a major change in the 1980s, a shift towards small government, a lot of capitalism, a lot of like kind of freedom of the private sector to a very different view, right? That because China has risen, because you've hollowed out the middle class in in a lot of the West, you've got a political reaction takes different forms, but you've got a political reaction in the rest of the world. in Trumpian kind of mindset.</p>
</details>

其核心问题是，你需要政府介入，叫停在贸易问题上所谓的**新自由主义共识**（Neoliberal Consensus: 指的是自1980年代以来主导西方经济政策的思想，倡导自由市场、放松管制、私有化和全球化贸易）。你需要保护美国产业，以保持地缘政治上的强大。你不能依赖其他国家。因此，你需要独立自主，将贸易视为一场零和游戏。在这种观念下，贸易逆差被视为对你财富的损害。这种想法，再加上政府加强管制带来的腐败等其他因素，已经改变了游戏规则。因此，对于投资者而言，你必须适应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The basic issues are okay, you need the government to step in and stop what's been going on in terms of the neoliberal consensus on trade. You need this to basically protect US industry in order to be geopolitically strong. You can't be dependent on other countries. So you need to be independent looking at trade as a zero- sum game where um where if you have a trade deficit that's actually a problem for your wealth and um and that that along with other elements that come with more government control on these things corruption and other things have have changed the way the game is being played. So for investors, you've got to adapt, right?</p>
</details>

但如果我在12个月前告诉你，世界在重商主义、关税等方面会是现在这个样子，你当时会预期市场作何反应？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But but if we if if I 12 months ago had told you what the world would look like now in terms of mercantalism, uh you know, tariffs and so on, you would what would you have expected markets to have done?</p>
</details>

如果只有这一个变量，你可能会认为这会导致资本从美国流出。你会觉得人们会降低在美国集中的巨大风险，因为情况变化太快，这些资产需要更高的风险溢价。你会认为美国从一个卓越的投资地变成了一个更普通的投资地。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Well, if it's only one thing changing, right, you would think that this would have led to a a bit of a shift away from the US. You would have thought that people would have taken down their massive risk concentration in the US because it's changing so quickly. You need a more of a risk premium on those assets and you're getting a more like the US from an exceptional place to invest to a more normal place to invest.</p>
</details>

但这并没有完全发生，对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it hasn't quite happened, right?</p>
</details>

没错，因为它不是唯一在发生的事情。不过，如果你审视系统内部，在某种程度上它确实发生了。如果你观察美国股市，自全球金融危机后**美国例外论**（American Exceptionalism: 一种信念，认为美国因其独特的起源、政治体系和历史发展，在世界上拥有独一无二的地位和角色）真正兴起以来的过去15年里，以共同货币计算，美国股市相对于世界其他地区股市的表现是这15年中最差的。所以在表象之下，你已经看到了这种变化。但美国当然也受到了我们谈到的另一件大事的支撑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Exactly. Because it's not the only thing going on. Okay. Though if you look underneath the system right in one way it did in the sense that if you look at US equities for the first time since American exceptionalism really emerged post the global financial crisis the last 15 years you've had the worst performance of US equities relative to the rest of the world equities in common currency terms that you've had over that 15-ear period. So under the surface you're seeing it but the US is of course buffeted by the other big thing we talked about.</p>
</details>

人工智能正在吸纳巨额资本，并且即将进入一个新阶段。我们稍后会谈到。但现在的情况是，现代重商主义让人们开始质疑美国的智慧和法治。你在机构投资者等群体中都能看到这种情绪。但同时有一个对冲因素，那就是你还能去哪里投资这场正在进行的技术革命呢？你已经看到了这种巨大的对冲效应。因此，表面上看起来风平浪静。如果你说标普500指数今年表现不错，和往年差不多。再看看债券，表面上一切都很好。但如果你深入挖掘，拆分股票市场，你会问：这些涨幅从何而来？剔除AI概念股后，美国股市相对于世界其他地区的投资表现如何？再看看黄金，这是另一个地缘政治正在发挥作用的例子。在这些地方，你就能看到变化。所以我认为，如果只看平均数的平静表象，而忽略其下的暗流涌动，你可能会误以为一切如常。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">AI is sucking up incredible amount of capital and that's about to enter a new phase. We'll get to that. But um but you've got this like yeah modern mercantalism people are questioning the wisdom and the the the rule of law in the United States. You see that across institutional investors etc. But you have an offset in that where else are you going to invest in the technological revolution that's going on. You've seen that massive offset. And so what looks like calm on the surface, right? If you said S&P 500's having perfectly good year, very similar to every year. And if you look at bonds too, everything looks fine on the surface. If you look underneath that, split up the equity market. Well, where's that equity coming from? How is the US equity market X the AI names doing relative to investments in the rest of the world? If you look at gold as another example where you're seeing the geopolitics play out. Um, those places you see it. And so I think you can make a mistake of thinking it's not happening by looking just at the calm of the of the averages versus what's happening beneath those averages.</p>
</details>

### 人工智能革命的历程与未来

你谈论AI已经很长时间了，现在它终于爆发了。它的发展和你当初的设想相比如何？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you've been talking about AI for a long period of time and now it's happening and and so how is it panning out compared to how you thought it would could pan out?</p>
</details>

从大的发展轨迹来看，基本符合预期。我30年前来到桥水，吸引我的其中一点是，桥水现在刚刚庆祝了50周年生日，当时它已经成立20年了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well on the big trajectory pretty much in line. So for me if I go back I um I came to Bridgewwater 30 years ago and one of the things that attracted me is Bridgewwater's now just celebrated 50th birthday. So Bridgewwater had been around for 20 years at that point.</p>
</details>

你1996年从达特茅斯学院一毕业就直接来了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well you you you came straight from Dartmouth in straight from Dartmouth in 96.</p>
</details>

是的，1996年，本科毕业后直接加入。当时桥水还是个很小的地方，只有40人。但我被它的基本理念所吸引，那就是有纪律地把你相信的一切都写下来，并严格测试它们是否真的正确。这件重要的事情在很多方面都与我的个性非常契合。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In '96 straight from undergrad and I was attracted to Bridgewwater. It was a tiny place, 40 people, tiny place at the time. But I was attracted to the basic concepts, which was a that you would have the discipline to take all of the things you believe, write them down, and stress test whether they're actually true. What a important thing that fit really with my personality in many ways.</p>
</details>

我当时想：“这对我来说太有道理了。” 在哪些问题上呢？关于宏观经济如何运作，市场如何定价。将你所有的人类直觉转化为算法。在那个阶段，桥水建立了一个**专家系统**（Expert System: 一种早期的人工智能程序，它通过模拟人类专家的决策能力来解决复杂问题），我相信它可能是史上最赚钱的专家系统。我们建立了一个关于如何做到这一点的专家系统。一切都源于人类的直觉。我致力于研究如何让数百名非常聪明的人，将他们的直觉转化为算法。我的专长是产生这些直觉，并建立一个社群，让人们将他们的直觉存入我们共同的理解库中，从而极大地增强它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But um but I said, "This really makes sense to me." And on what questions? On the questions of how does the macroeconomy work? How do markets set prices? take all of your human intuition, translate that into um algorithms. And at that phase, Bridgewater and I believe it's probably the most profitable expert system that was ever created. We built an expert system for how you do that. Everything was human intuition. I worked on how do you take hundreds of people, really smart people, how do you get them to take their intuitions, put them into algorithms, do that? that my expertise was generating those intuitions and building a community of people who deposited their intuitions into our compound understanding massively.</p>
</details>

大约在2012年，我开始思考：机器什么时候能自己编写规则，而不仅仅是支持我们已有的规则？我们一直以来都拥有出色的技术来支持人类的直觉，但机器的直觉何时能真正超越人类的直觉？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then about in 2012 I said okay how are we going to when will machines write the rules not just support the rules which we've been doing have great technology support human intuition but when will their intuition actually be better than human intuition</p>
</details>

我从2012年开始了那段旅程。当时的技术还远未达到那个水平。有大数据，有很棒的模式匹配，但完全没有类似直觉的东西。但我一直在寻找我知道我们需要的那些要素。我们需要推理能力来产生直觉，还需要一些特定的部件。你需要语言模型的出现，需要可诊断性的提升，还需要解决如何处理数据量很少的小数据问题。我走遍世界，这段旅程把我带到了OpenAI。我是OpenAI的第一轮投资者之一，因为他们在做一些独特的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right and that I started on that journey in 2012 and they were nothing like that there's big data great pattern matching but there was nothing like intuition but I was looking for the pieces that I knew we need we needed a reasoning to generate intuition and we needed certain pieces. You needed um language models to come along. You needed diagnosibility to um come along. You needed to figure out how to deal with small data problems where you don't have a lot of data. And I went through the world and that that journey brought me to Open AI. I was in the first round of investors in OpenAI because they were doing unique things.</p>
</details>

那是什么时候？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When was this?</p>
</details>

我想大概是2016年。当时伊隆·马斯克刚刚卸任，他们需要资金，并决定……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That was I think it was about 2016. Mhm. Um and so they just Elon Musk had just stepped aside and they needed funding and they were deciding to um</p>
</details>

你当时是以个人名义投资的，而不是代表桥水？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you invested in it on behalf of Bridgewwater or</p>
</details>

不，是个人投资。当时桥水内部对于如何处理AI有不同看法。所以我个人投资了，因为我很感兴趣，想看看我们如何能将这些部件组合起来。我也对AI安全问题非常感兴趣。总之，我参与其中，认识了很多科学家，了解了他们的想法，这后来又把我引向了Anthropic。当我认识的一些最优秀的科学家创办Anthropic时，我几乎是第一个给他们开支票的人。但所有这些都是一段探索之旅，旨在寻找我们需要的那些部件，以创造出能与人类竞争的推理能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, personally we had different views at Bridgewwater at the time on how to how to handle AI but so I invested in that personally and I um because I was interested I wanted to see how can we build these pieces together. I was also very interested in AI safety issues and so anyway I was there for that got to know a lot of the scientists and the thinking which brought me to anthropic later on when some of the best scientists I knew started anthropic and was literally the first check there but all that was a journey</p>
</details>

最重要的是，在这段旅程中，我遇到了Jazz Econ，他现在是我们在桥水的首席科学家。我们已经构建了一个人工智能投资者，并持续改进它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">to find how can we find these pieces we need to create reasoning that could compete with humans and most importantly along that journey I met Jazz Econ who's our chief scientist at Bridgewater and now we've we've built an artificial investor and continue to make it better</p>
</details>

你什么时候雇佣他的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when did hire him</p>
</details>

2018年。他当时是伯克利大学的教授，研究一些小数据问题。他也在和私营公司合作，但领域和我们不同。不过他所做的事情正是我在寻找的。他是个不可思议的天才，所以我把他带到了桥水，我们开始一起工作。但当时的技术仍未达到我们想要做的水平。到了2022年，我说，技术差不多准备好了，我们需要的部件已经到位，可以开始构建一个人工智能投资者了。我们从2022年3月开始了这项征程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">2018. So he was a professor at Berkeley working on some of these small data problems. He was working with private companies as well but but he was it wasn't in our field but he was what he was doing was exactly what I was looking for and um he's just incredible genius and so brought him into Bridgewwater and we started working together and still the technology wasn't ready for what we wanted to do. 2022 I said the technology is almost ready that the pieces we needed we could start building an artificial investor. started that March in 2022.</p>
</details>

那基本上和ChatGPT是同一时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That was chat basically the same time.</p>
</details>

是的，没错。当时所有的工具都已就绪，我认为我们可以集齐所有部件，真正构建一个能与你我竞争的人工智能投资者。它能思考世界，能真正产生关于世界的直觉，还能编写规则来说明如何应用这些直觉。到2024年，我们认为我们有了一个足够聪明的投资者，可以在世界上创造**阿尔法收益**（Alpha: 投资回报中超过市场基准（如标普500指数）的部分，代表了投资经理的主动管理能力）。我们一直在与一些卓越的客户合作进行这项工作。所以现在我的角色是，作为Pure Alpha的管理首席投资官，负责人力直觉的部分，同时也管理这个围绕机器学习智能体设计的独立实体。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. Right. Right. Right. On then all the tools were coming together at that time that I thought we could get all our pieces and we could actually build an artificial investor that could compete with me and you on how do you how do you think about the world? How do you actually generate intuitions about the world? How do you write rules to say okay this is how I would apply that intuition. And we then by 2024 thought we had a smart enough investor to to generate alpha in the world. and um and have been doing that. We're with some of our incredible clients. Um and so right now my role is running um Pure Alpha as managing CIO of Pure Alpha where all the human intuition sits but also running this separate entity that's designed around a machine learning agent.</p>
</details>

### AI 投资周期：从被低估到危险的资源争夺战

从那时起，观察市场对AI股票、芯片制造商等的反应，你认为市场的表现和你预想的一致吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But but if but we'll come back to this a bit but just um so from there um looking at what's been happening to the market the AI stocks uh you know the chip producers uh and so on how is how is the market reaction to this panning out compared to what you thought?</p>
</details>

是的，我想说，就目前的发展来看，人们之前是大大低估了。在我们之前所处的阶段，我常说“泡沫还在前方，而不是已经过去”。从ChatGPT时刻开始，我或多或少都会被问到：这是不是泡沫？我的想法是，我认为未来会有泡沫，但我们离泡沫阶段还远得很。我们当时处于一个人们完全不知道自己将面临什么的阶段，也就是说，他们不了解这件事有多重要，以及将有多少投资涌入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And I'd say um if that's where it's panning out. I think people were way underestimating. I the phase that we were in before I used to say the bubble's ahead of us, not behind us. I get the question starting with Hatchp moment more or less. Is this a bubble? And my thought was I think there will be a bubble but we're nowhere near the bubble phase. we were in the phase where people have no idea what's hitting them like meaning how important this is and how much is going to get invested</p>
</details>

因为这不是一个典型的周期。当你有像伊隆·马斯克、萨姆·奥尔特曼、谷歌这样的人，他们的业务受到威胁，并且相信控制地球乃至宇宙的力量只在几年之遥时，他们的动机就不是典型周期中的那种普通利润激励。这不是一个和其他**资本支出周期**（Capex Cycle: 公司用于购买、维护或升级实物资产（如财产、建筑、技术或设备）的资金支出呈现出的周期性波动）一样的周期。这笔钱是一定会花出去的。我在2022年、2023年就是这么想的，他们会把这些建设起来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because this is not a typical cycle when you when you have people like Elon Musk and Sam Alman and and Google and so on whose whose businesses are threatened and believe that the power to control Earth and the universe is only a couple years away. They're not motivated by this normal profit incentives of the typical cycle. It's not a capex cycle that's the same as other capex cycles. This money is going to get spent, right? I'm thinking that in 2022, 2023, they're going to build this out.</p>
</details>

也许有一天他们会被证明这是一条死胡同，但我们离任何这种可能性都还很远。数据中心将会被建起来，半导体将会被使用。这一切已经发生了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Maybe someday they'll be proven this is a deadend path, but we're so far from any possibility of that happening that the the data centers were going to get built out, the semiconductors were going to get used. That has played out.</p>
</details>

那么我们现在处于什么阶段？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so where so where are we now?</p>
</details>

现在我们刚刚进入了一个我称之为更危险的阶段。我仍然不认为我们处于泡沫之中，但我们确实处在一个更危险的阶段，原因如下：我们现在处于发展AI的资源争夺阶段。资源已经不够用了，所以每个人都在争抢。微软已经抢占了所有能接入电网获得电力的土地，他们在这方面做得很好。其他人则需要想办法在电网之外寻找电力来源。Nvidia未来几年的供应也早已被预订一空，诸如此类。所以你正处于这个资源争夺阶段。在网络世界里，复合增长是很容易实现的。但现在它进入了物理世界，要继续保持每年50-60%的增长……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So now we've just entered what I I've said is a more dangerous phase. I still don't think we're in a bubble, but we are in a more dangerous phase for the following reasons. That a we're in the resource grab phase now to do AI. There isn't enough resources to go around. So, everybody's trying to grab their resources. Microsoft's got all the land where you can get power on the grid. They've they've done a great job of getting that land. Other people need to figure out places off the grid to get power. the Nvidia's supply has been like bought up for years to come in the future and so on and so forth. So you're in this resource grab phase. Compound growth is easy to do when it's in cyber like in the tech world you can do that. But now it's in the physical world you to continue growing 50 60% a year.</p>
</details>

### 三大资源争夺战：电力、芯片与人才

基本上，要控制这个领域，你需要电力、芯片和科学家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Basically to control this you need power, you need chips and you need scientists.</p>
</details>

是的。看看所有这些领域正在发生什么。在任何你能获得电力的地方……我不知道你上次去阿布扎比是什么时候，但那里的景象简直令人难以置信。如果你在阿布扎比坐上一辆出租车，会发现司机和他兄弟都在建数据中心。任何能建电厂的地方，他们都在建数据中心。也许欧洲是个例外，但在其他任何能获得电力的地方，你把芯片放进去，就在建数据中心了。而且建设速度非常快。所以你必须考虑：哪里能获得廉价电力？谁能得到它？芯片从哪里来？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Look at what's going on with all of those. Everywhere you could get p power. I don't know last time you were in Abu Dhabi, but it's just incredible. If you go to Abu Dhabi and you sit in a cab, like the cab driver and his brother are building a data center. Like the anywhere you can build power, they are building data centers. Maybe Europe's the exception, but everywhere else you get power. You put chips in a in there and you're building a data center. And the rate of that is huge. So you have to get where can you get the cheap power? How do you how who gets it? Where do you get the chips?</p>
</details>

所以你认为电力问题没有被过分夸大？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so the power So you don't think so the power you don't think it's uh kind of overhyped? Do you think that's that whole?</p>
</details>

我不认为它被夸大了。我理解这其中真正的风险之一是，折旧周期可能会非常快，而且从某种意义上说，你希望它必须快。如果你看Anthropic、OpenAI和谷歌的使命，构建能更快构建AI的AI，他们必须做的事情之一就是想办法让芯片更高效，让能源更高效。他们正试图用AI来做这些事。鉴于谷歌在蛋白质折叠等领域取得的成就，我认为一些能让当前资产贬值的科学进步，将来自这些资产本身，来自AI自身，它会产生更好的方法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think it's overhyped. I mean I understand like the one of the real ch the whole thing has this risk that the depreciation schedule is probably going to be quite fast and you hope it has to be in a sense that if you take anthropics mission or open AI and Google like the idea of building AI that builds faster AI one of the things they have to do is figure out how to make the chips more efficient make the energy more efficient and they're trying to use AI to do those things and given what Google achieved on protein folding etc I think there some of the scientific advantages advances that will depreciate the current assets will come from those assets themselves from the AI will generate better ways to do this.</p>

但我认为现在这个问题并没有被高估，原因我刚才已经描述过了。很多人，包括我自己，都坚信这背后蕴藏着难以置信的力量，比如控制地球上各种结果的力量、青春之泉等等。当人们有这类想法时，他们会动用一切可用资源去实现它。所以我认为电力问题没有被夸大。

再谈谈芯片领域的争夺战，以及我们看到的循环性和**供应商融资**（Vendor Financing: 指卖方（如Nvidia）直接向买方提供信贷，帮助买方购买其产品。在这里，Nvidia通过投资初创公司，确保这些公司购买Nvidia的芯片，从而锁定客户并控制生态系统）等现象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the second on chips you were going to ask tell me about the land grab on and also the the kind of the circularity and the vendor financing and so on that we're seeing here</p>
</details>

好的。首先，关于芯片的争夺战，每个人都想进入下一个、再下一个级别的模型。指数级增长真的很难跟上。当规模还小的时候，每年增长60%是一回事。现在要让计算能力每年增长60%，如果你把这个趋势外推三个模型周期，地球上将到处都是数据中心。这显然不会发生，必须有所改变来阻止这种情况。但这种指数级增长极其困难，芯片又如此稀缺。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah good so the first part I'd say the the land grab on chips is look, everybody needs if you want to get to the next level in the next the next two levels of models, right? This is what exponential growth is really hard to keep up with, right? That how do you grow it was one thing to grow 60% a year when you're small. Now to grow compute 60% a year. If you extrapolate that out for three models, you've got data centers everywhere on Earth. That's obviously not going to happen. Things have to change to prevent that from happening. But but um but that exponential growth is incredibly hard and the chips are so scarce that you need that</p>
</details>

Nvidia现在处于这样一个位置，这就涉及到供应商融资。人们看到这种供应商融资，以为是正常的泡沫动态，是他们获取收入的方式。完全不是。Nvidia想卖多少芯片就能卖多少，他们不愁销路。但他们不想建立一个会让他们失去竞争优势的体系。他们的问题是谷歌是一个真正的竞争对手。谷歌试图掌控从底层芯片到上层应用的全栈技术。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Nvidia is now in this position and this goes to vendor financing. People look at this vendor financing and think it's because of normal bubble dynamics. This is how they're going to get their revenue. Not at all. Nvidia can get as much revenue as it wants. They have no problem selling the chips, but they don't want to set up a system where they lose their competitive edge. Their problem is Google is a true competitor. Google's trying to go the whole stack all the way down to the chips.</p>
</details>

他们不希望谷歌获胜，或者说不希望谷歌成为最终的赢家。所以他们试图控制整个生态系统。他们就像“镀金时代”的标准石油公司，试图对事物建立垄断控制。所以，他们创建自己的生态系统，把芯片卖给那些需要他们芯片，并且不会创造出替代品的人。你现在看到的，就是一场生态系统的设计。有一个谷歌生态系统，某种程度上有一个亚马逊生态系统，然后还有一个由Nvidia控制的生态系统，顶层可能有OpenAI的某些模型，并贯穿谷歌所拥有的所有环节。当你看到所有这些交易时，你看到的是每个人都必须锁定合作伙伴，确定从哪里获得芯片和电力，如果不这样做，他们就会死掉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They don't want Google to win or they don't want Google to be the the final win. So, they're trying to control the ecosystem. They're like Standard Oil in the Gilded Age trying to create monopolistic control on things. So, create their own e ecosystem and sell their chips to people who need their chips who will not create an alternative to their chips. So what you're seeing is a design of the ecosystem where there's a Google ecosystem there's somewhat of an Amazon ecosystem and then there's an Nvidia controlled ecosystem that has let's say open AI certain models on the top and goes all the way through all the steps that Google has and that's what you're seeing when you're seeing all these deals is everybody's got to lock up who do I partner with where am I going to get my chips and power and if I don't do it I'm going to die.</p>

那么科学家的争夺战呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. What about the land grab of scientists?</p>

这是最棘手的一个，因为顶尖的科学家并不多。

<p class="english-text">How many are there? How many how many really good ones?</p>

这可能不是一个适合我回答的问题，但我认为不到一千人。所以这个资源非常有限。如果你是Meta，你觉得你没有科学家，但你有芯片和电力，你就会去挖科学家。你现在确实看到了这种情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, it's probably not a great question for me, but but I think less than a thousand. Um, and so that's really constrained. And if you're if you're meta and you don't feel like you have the scientists, but you have the chips and the power, you get the scientists, right? you're seeing this actually really</p>
</details>

而且你可以用非常高的价格去买他们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and you can't buy them at a very high price.</p>
</details>

你买下他们，但你买的是那些可以被买走的人。这总是一个文化问题。当然，他们也可能再次被买走。这就是问题之一，如果你看生态系统中那些进展不顺利的事情，就是有太多的科学家，太多的人，很自然地被“我该跳到哪里去拿下一份薪水”所吸引。这就像足球运动员和转会季一样。

<details>

<p class="english-text">You buy them, right? But then you're buying the ones who are viable. That's always culturally as you know like that's a cultural issue and um and of course then they're also viable again. Meaning like this is one of the problems if you take how fast the if you're like things that are going badly in the ecosystem is too many of the scientists too many people naturally are drawn to like where do I jump to get the next paycheck and that when you're trying soccer players and the kind of the transfer season</p>
</details>

这种情况现在非常糟糕。你会看到不同实验室之间的差异。有些人去Anthropic是因为使命感。他们中的许多人留在那里，我想说，他们留住人才的能力是独特的，因为去那里的人是为了一个有点不同的使命。当然，每个人都有贪婪的一面，我也不怪任何人。但你在不同地方看到，谁能留住科学家，情况是不同的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">exactly so that's really bad now you're seeing and this is where I would think you see differences in the labs you know there are people that went to anthropic because the mission there many of them are there I'd say like their ability to maintain their talent is unique because the people that went there are there for a mission that's a little bit different. Now, everybody has and I don't blame anybody. Everybody has greed in in them to some degree, but um but you're seeing differences in the different places of who can hold on to scientists</p>
</details>

我认为谷歌在留住科学家方面做得很好，他们长期以来一直在与这种文化作斗争，并且拥有大量令人难以置信的原始素材。除此之外，就非常非常困难了。你看到一些初创公司，比如我对Thinking Machines印象非常深刻，我认为他们有很棒的人才，但他们才刚刚起步，未来如何还未可知。所以当你环顾四周，你会发现这种人才跳槽现象，可悲地在很大程度上减缓了科学进步。一些重大的突破需要一个团队长期合作才能实现。我认为那些AI领域目前缺失的突破是很有可能实现的，但随着大家都在跳来跳去，这无疑减缓了进程。

<p class="english-text">I think Google is doing a good job of holding on to scientists and have been fighting this culture for a long time and have a lot of raw material. That's incredible.

Um and so I think when you look around this is sadly slowing down scientific progress in a big way. This this sort of everybody jumping around and not it's going to take some of the big breakthroughs are going to take a team working together for a extended period of time to get through. I think they're very possible the breakthroughs that are missing in AI today but but with everybody jumping around that's certainly slowing it down.</p>

### 资本集中与全球政治格局的重塑

我们谈了经济（重商主义），谈了科技（电力、芯片、科学家），现在谈第三点：资本，以及所有流向美国的资本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So just to remind uh everybody of the structure here we talked about the economy mercalism we talked about tech where we touched on power chips and scientists and then the last of the three points is capital and all the capital that's gone to the US. So what are your thinking here?</p>
</details>

这非常有趣，因为另外两个压力在某种程度上是相互抵消的。但我认为经济已经改变了。回到重商主义，美国已经不再是二战后的那个美国了。全球机构的理念，甚至美国当前对其自身利益的看法，都发生了根本性的变化。美国总是在追求自身利益，但它过去认为国际合作等符合其利益的看法，已经发生了重大改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it's super interesting because these two other pressures cut against each other to some degree, but I think the economy has changed. Just back on mercalism for a second. The US is no longer the US that it's been post World War II. The idea of global institutions and even what the US currently sees in its interest has changed radically. the US was always pursuing its interest but but what it saw is in its interest of international cooperation and things like that um have have changed in a significant way.</p>
</details>

我认为你正开始看到这种变化显现出来。我们仍处于后续步骤的非常早期阶段。世界其他国家对美国所作所为的报复会是什么？今年让我惊讶的一件事是，美国以一种霸凌的姿态出现，说：“好吧，我们要提高你们的关税，而你们对此无能为力。”结果除了中国，所有国家都接受了。老实说，我很惊讶。我记得曾与政府成员对话，问：“你们打算怎么做？他们会反击的，而我们迫切需要世界其他国家，不是因为贸易，而是因为资本。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think you are seeing that start to play out. We're still in the very early phase of what the next steps are. What is the retaliation from the rest of the world against what the US has happened? One of the things that surprised me this year is that the US came out as a bully in a sense, like came out and said, "Okay, we're going to raise your tariffs." And you're not going to do anything about it. And everybody except for China went along with that. I was surprised. Honestly, I remember conversations with members of the um administration saying like, "How are you going to do this? like they're going to hit back and we are um desperately in need of the rest of the world not because of trade but because of capital.</p>
</details>

他们为什么不反击呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So why are they not hitting back?</p>
</details>

我认为首先，特朗普成功地分化了他们。如果你试图反击，他会进一步提高关税。而且存在一个问题，即所有其他国家都较小，所以他们无法以同等规模反击，并且冒着被单独挑出来的风险。这是一个原因。不过，在表面之下，在一些不那么明显的事情上，比如如何投资，你确实看到一些国家在行动。你看到加拿大的立法者说：“好吧，我们必须投资加拿大。”你看到各地都出现了本土偏好，作为对此的反应。我认为你会看到更多这样的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I think people first thing is Trump has been successful in picking people off, right? If you try to punch back, he raises the tariffs even more and there is like a a problem of all the countries being smaller and so they can't punch in the same size and and they take the risk of being picked off. So that's one reason. I think beneath the surface though on things that are less obvious like how do you invest etc. You are seeing countries, you're seeing certainly the lawmakers in Canada saying, "Okay, we got to invest in Canada." You're seeing home bias everywhere as a reaction to this. I think you will see more of that.</p>
</details>

但在特朗普担任总统期间，反击是困难的，因为他会再次反击，你必须准备好迎接那场战斗。但你在政治中看到的是，世界其他国家的选民对美国的善意已经崩溃。我们看到从2024年到2025年，世界其他国家对美国的支持度出现了我们前所未见的巨大滑坡。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the punching back is difficult with Trump in the presidency because he's going to punch again and you have to be up for that fight. But what you see in the politics which will lead to this is the US goodwill among the rest of the world's voters has collapsed. We have saw from 20 um 24 to 2025 the biggest collapse in support for the United States in the rest of the world that we've ever seen.</p>
</details>

这意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what are the what are the implications of that?</p>
</details>

你看到的是，民粹主义、重商主义的候选人在各地获得支持。我认为第一波浪潮将是各地向民粹主义右翼的转变。你正在看到这一点，无论是德国的AfD党，还是——这很令人震惊，但如果英国今天举行选举，我想我的信息可能落后了几周，但改革党会获胜。想想五年前，这简直是不可思议的想法。法国等地也是如此。所以，趋势是转向民粹主义，转向那些会以民粹主义右翼的方式照顾自己国家的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What you're seeing is populist mercalist um candidates gaining ground everywhere. So I think you're going to get the first wave is a shift to the populist right everywhere. And you're seeing that if it's the AFD in Germany, if you I mean shocking, but if the UK had election today, I think I might be out of date by a couple weeks here, but reform party would win. I mean, take that compared to 5 years ago, that's like an insane thought. And same thing, France, etc. So, a shift towards populist to people that are going to take care of their own countries in in their in that way of populist right kind of thing.</p>
</details>

当然，民粹主义右翼接着会引发民粹主义左翼的更强力量。就像你看到中产阶级被掏空一样，政治光谱的中间地带也完全被掏空了。我们正在进入的世界，可能先是转向民粹主义右翼。如果那些政策行不通，就转向民粹主义左翼。这就是动态。而民粹主义右翼的反击，尽管他们与特朗普结盟，但更多地是关注国内问题，减少国际合作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And of course, what the populist right then sets off is more strength than the populist left. New York City mayoral election or whatever, but you see the shift towards populist right, populist left, and the continued just like you had the hollowing out of the middle class. You've had the total hollowing out of the middle of the economic of the political spectrum. And that's the world we're going into is this probably shift to populist right. If those policies don't work, shift to populist left. And that's the dynamic. and the populist right, the hitback, even though they're aligned to Trump, is just more domestic um more focus on their domestic issues and less international cooperation.</p>

### 宏观经济展望：通胀、增长与债务

现在我们描绘了世界的图景。当你看它将导致的经济指标和发展时，比如说，这对通货膨胀有什么影响？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So now so now we have so now we have painted the world, right? What are so when you then look at what it's going to lead to in terms of economic indicators and developments, let's kick off for instance with in what are the implications for for inflation for instance?</p>
</details>

从重商主义的角度看，刚刚发生的这些事情显然是通胀性的。有两大因素。首先是关税。你不再能以最便宜的方式确保你的供应链，而必须确保一个更具韧性、更本土化的商品供应链，而不是廉价的。所以这是通胀性的。过去30年的一大好处是通过利用最便宜、最高效的地方来生产商品，从而带来的生产力提升，现在这个世界里这套逻辑完全被打破了。即使你以为可以离开中国去印度，但现在印度的关税比中国还高。如果你是一家国际公司，建立这样的供应链极其困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if you take the the things that just happened from a merculus perspective, they're clearly inflationary. Two big things, right? You get tariffs, which creates rather than being able to secure your pipeline in the cheapest way, you you have to secure a pipeline of goods that's more um resilient and more domestic than cheap, right? So a that's inflationary. the product one of the huge benefits over the last 30 years was the productivity change by taking advantage of the the cheapest and most efficient places to build things that's totally wrecked in the world right even you thought okay we'll get out of China and go to India well India's tariffs are now higher than China like there's if you're an international company this is incredibly hard to build a build that so that's inflationary</p>
</details>

其次，另一个巨大的通胀推力是，你看到各地都在做出财政反应。德国是最极端的例子，但也是一个很好的例子。你现在必须建立自己的军队，摆脱对美国的依赖。没有什么比军费开支更能引发通胀了，因为它创造了对劳动力和商品的需求，却没有向实体经济提供任何供给。所以你在非战争时期看到军费开支以惊人的速度飙升。此外，你还需要重建基础设施，以便将货物运往其他地方。这些因素都是通胀性的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">secondly the big inflationary push from this is everywhere you're seeing a fiscal reaction right that Germany most extreme but But a great example a you got to build your own military now. You have to get off the dependence on the US. You got to build your own military and that there's nothing more inflationary really than military spending because it creates demand for labor and demand for goods with no supply into the real economy. So you've got military spending surging at incred in nonwart time incredibly fast rates. And you've got um so military spending plus you've got the need to rebuild the infrastructure so that in Canada's case but just in Europe's case too can't ship to the US as much anymore. How do I get my goods to other places and those pieces are inflationary.</p>
</details>

那么这种影响的规模有多大？你认为通胀会比普遍共识差多少？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the and the magnitude of this. So how much worse do you think inflation will be than the general consensus?</p>
</details>

另一方面，增长则由AI投资主导。AI投资虽然开始占用电力容量等资源，但相对于单位GDP而言，其劳动密集度非常低。所以你面临的是一个通缩性的、疲软的劳动力市场，因为大部分增长……如果你看美国今年的增长，你会看到一个正常的增长年份，2%到2.5%的增长，但如果没有AI，增长率可能只有1%。而来自AI投资的这1%的增长，其劳动密集度非常低。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let me say the flip side of that is on the other hand growth is dominated by this AI investment AI investment while starting to take up power capacity and whatever is very low labor intensity relative to the unit of GDP so you have a disinflationary weak labor market because so much of the growth if you take US growth this year right you're going to have a normal growth year this is the same thing in the averages 2% 2 and a half% growth but without AI it would be 1% % right so and that 1% of growth that's coming from AI investment it's um it's very non- labor intensive</p>
</details>

所以你认为净效应是……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so do you think and net net</p>
</details>

我认为，净效应是，通胀在未来几年将成为政策制定者的一个重要制约因素。你看到的盈亏平衡通胀率大约在2.5%左右，我们认为美联储对高于2.5%的水平感到非常舒适，而我们现在的基础通胀率可能在3%的范围内，并且有这些因素推高通胀的风险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">net net I think we are inflation particularly for the next couple years is going to be a significant constraint on policy makers that you're running around like break even inflation is around 2 and a2 we think the fed is very comfortable above two and a half and probably we're in the three range as a base right now with the risk that these things push higher</p>
</details>

但AI的故事，所有这些投资都有一个J型曲线。在第一阶段，你投入大量资源，除了投资本身，你得不到太多产出。但随后，你会迎来AI最终将产生高度通缩效应的阶段，尽管我认为那还比较遥远。与此同时，这在很大程度上取决于央行选择做什么。民粹主义的一部分，尤其是在美国，是控制中央银行，将其纳入行政权力，并让他们降低实际利率。在这样的繁荣时期降低实际利率，如果最终走上那条路，将是特别具有通胀性的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um but but the AI story right and this depends all these investments have a Jc curve in the first phase you don't get you spend a lot of resources you don't get a lot of output other than the investment itself but then you get the um the part of AI that will eventually be highly disinflationary although I think that's further out and in meantime central banks It depends a lot on what central banks choose to do. You know, the US part of populism certainly in the US is getting control of the central bank, taking it into executive power and and getting them to lower real rates, which lowering real rates into a boom like this is particularly inflationary if it ends up going down that path.</p>
</details>

关于经济增长，这将是一个双轨经济。我认为美国将有良好的增长，总体上也会有不错的增长，因为欧洲有财政刺激，而美国有AI。明年的增长将进一步受到AI的推动。我们认为美国的增长将略高于潜力水平，大约在2.5%左右。但其中约1.5%将来自AI。所以你可能会看到一个疲软的劳动力市场，许多地方经济疲软，而同时一个高度集中的行业却在蓬勃发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Economic growth. Yeah. So growth um is going to be this two-track economy, right? I think you're going to have good growth in the United States and generally decent growth because you've got this fiscal thing in Europe and you've got this um in the US you've got AI where growth next year is going to be further pushed by this AI push and um and so growth in the US we think will be a little bit above um you know above potential two two and a like two and a half kind of percent growth and um and but a lot of that one and a half percent or so is going to be AI so you're going to have a weak probably weak labor market, weak economy in many places while you have this huge boom in a very concentrated sector.</p>
</details>

那么预算赤字和政府债务情况呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So what about budget deficits and the government debt situation?</p>
</details>

这是世界正在变化的另一个方面。今年年初，我写了一篇文章，叫做《我们现在都是重商主义者》。我正在构思明年的文章，标题有点夸张，还没完全确定，但大概是《我们现在都是巴西》。我的意思是，巴西长期以来一直受到制约，尽管其债务主要以本国货币计价。这不像90年代的巴西，当时的问题是他们无法偿还以美元计价的债务。但尽管大部分债务是本币，他们的行动能力仍然非常有限。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, that's another aspect of what's changing in the world is you've got you've put yourself where let me just say one thing at the beginning of the you know at the beginning of this year a little before the beginning of this year I wrote a piece called we're all merciless now and I'm thinking about the piece for next year which is a little overstated I'm not quite there but something like we're all Brazil now and what I what I mean by that is Brazil for a long time has been constrained despite having their debt mostly in domestic currency now it's not like Brazil in the '90s where the problem was having dollar denominated debt that they couldn't fund, but despite having most of their debt in domestic currency, they're very limited in what they can do.</p>
</details>

你开始看到，英国就处于这种境地。这改变了动态。当你拥有财政政策空间，像德国那样，并宣布一项大规模的财政政策时，会发生什么？你的货币升值，股市上涨，利率略微上升。但如果你是英国，如果英国说：“我要做德国正在做的事，我要开一张大的财政支票。”货币会贬值，股市可能会下跌，利率会大幅上升。所以你现在看到的是，更多发达国家因触及财政政策的极限而受到制约。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You're starting to see that the UK is in that position. Um, and that changes the dynamic. When you have fiscal policy and you have a lot of room, like Germany does as an example, and you announce a big fiscal policy, what happens? Your currency goes up, your stock market goes up. Um, when you have and interest rates go up a little, when you're the UK, if the UK said, "I'm going to do what Germany's going to do. I'm going to write a big fiscal check." Currency would go down. The equity market would probably go down, although that's closer call, and interest rates would rise a lot. And so, what you see now is more developed world countries constrained by hitting the limits of fiscal policy.</p>
</details>

财政政策的极限是复杂的，不是一个简单的数字。比如日本，政府累积债务可以是GDP的300%，而在巴西，这个极限可能在60-80%就达到了。区别在于国内储蓄有多少，生产力有多高，以及人们储蓄本国货币的意愿有多强。但所有国家都有极限，我们正在某些国家测试这些极限。这意味着我们正从一个政策制定者不受约束的世界，转向一个越来越多的国家受到约束的世界。当情况变糟时，他们过去可以降低利率、印钞和花钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and the limits of fiscal policy are complicated. It's not like a simple number like you could take Japan they could have 300% of GDP in terms of their budget their accumulated debt for the government and in Brazil you might hit that limit at 60 80%. The difference is how much domestic savings you are, how much productivity you have, how much willingness there is to save in your currency. But all countries have limits and we are testing those limits in certain countries. Which means you're moving from a world where policy makers were unconstrained. when something went bad they could lower interest rates and print and spend money</p>
</details>

现在，越来越多的国家，包括根据我们的衡量标准正在接近极限的美国，都受到了约束。当你受到约束时，花钱实际上会变得适得其反，而不是有益的。今天的英国和巴西就是这种情况。美国也正朝着这条线漂移。我认为我们正处在制度的死亡行军中。你已经看到世界贸易组织，它现在还能做什么？所有国际机构都已名存实亡。在美国，国内机构也正在迅速衰落。

我们的理念与大多数人不同的主要一点是，我会说，我处理你这100美元的方式是，思考我们如何在各种可能的世界中生存下来，而不是试图挑选最好的那个。这非常不同。如果你看过去15年，大多数人已经放弃了多元化，因为它在15年里都没有奏效。你所需要的只是美国、美国股票，而且流动性越好越好。这种策略非常成功。但我认为这基本上是一个陷阱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And the main thing that I'd say is different in our philosophy than most is I I would say the way I would take your $100 is is to say how do we survive in the wide range of possible worlds rather than try to pick the best thing. Yeah. And um and that is very different, right? If you take basically the last 15 years. I'm sorry. Is that the way you always think? Let's survive rather than let's get rich. I think it's the way to get rich in the long term. Um and that because basically there's a lot of ways to make money in the world. The main thing you want to do is avoid really bad outcomes and that's how compounding wealth works. If you keep earning more and you're in the game, you'll you'll be able to compound wealth in an incredible way. So for me right now, if I look at the world, I think it's very dangerous. And this depends like because you have this home bias move and a lot of the geopolitics like literally where you're located. Being located in Norway is an advantage, a disadvantage in certain ways. Being located in the US advantage and disadvantage in certain ways in terms of what you should do. But to me, what where I think most people the last 15 years are a trap. Most people have moved away from diversification because it hasn't worked for 15 years. All you needed was the US US equities and more liquid the better. Like that has worked incredibly well. I think it's mostly a trap.</p>
</details>

所以我的做法是，建立一个比大多数人更全球多元化的投资组合。因为你不知道未来的赢家和输家会是谁，而美国的变化是相当激进的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So the ways I would do this is look get a much more globally diversified portfolio and than most people have and because you don't know what the winners and losers are going to be and the US the change of the US are are quite radical.</p>

欧洲怎么样？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what about Europe?</p>
</details>

我认为欧洲是可投资的。欧洲发生了很多变化。财政政策的转变，以及意识到你不能靠向美国或中国出口来建立经济。你必须创造一个更内需驱动的经济，转向财政政策。财政政策有利于国内公司的利润。欧洲需要转向一个更独立的经济体，我认为他们会这么做。欧洲的公司已经看到了美国发生的事情，在某些方面，比如更好地对待股东、向股东返还资金、回购股票等方面，欧洲实际上已经变得比以前更友好于股东。如果你看欧洲和美国直接竞争的大公司，通常欧洲公司的定价更便宜。在很多情况下，欧洲公司的盈利和管理实际上比美国的可比公司更好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Look, I think Europe is investable like even though um as we agree that the fiscal changes look there's two things that have changed a lot in Europe. The fiscal move the move like look there you can't build this economy on exporting to the US and you can't build this economy on exporting to China even. Um that you've got to create a more domestic economy a shift towards fiscal policy. fiscal policy works in the profits of domestic companies. Um, and you need to move to a more independent economy in Europe and I think they'll do that and companies in Europe have seen what's happened to the US and in some ways unfortunately not in the technological domain which is a massive problem but on treating shareholders better on on returning money to shareholders buybacks etc. that Europe has actually moved to a more shareholder friendly place in many ways than it was for a while. And the companies that are bigger, if you look at companies that directly compete between Europe and the US, they're generally priced cheap. In a lot of cases, the European companies are actually have better earnings and and better um management than the comparable companies in the US.</p>
</details>

中国何时会进入视野？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When does China come in?</p>
</details>

这在一定程度上取决于你所在的地理位置，因为投资中国的最大风险是你的政府说你不能投资中国，而不是身在中国的风险。我认为中国对全球多元化非常重要。他们已经迈出了一大步。中国经历了一次大的去杠杆化过程。他们现在知道，要想在AI上与美国竞争，这是关乎存亡的大事。他们需要私营部门来做这件事。他们看到美国因为市场运作良好，股权市场运作良好，获得了远超任何政府所能提供的巨额资金。所以他们已经转变了，你看到他们把阿里巴巴带回来，说“好吧，我们必须这么做”。他们知道需要股权市场来运作。而且与欧洲不同，中国有令人难以置信的技术独创性。虽然他们在前沿AI方面落后，但在中国企业中应用AI方面，他们可能处于前沿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, this depends a little bit where you're located because the biggest risk of being invested in China is your government saying you can't be invested in China. than the risk of being in China. Look, I think China is really important to global diversification. They have taken a big step. You you were in this big deleveraging in China. The deleveraging was playing a certain course. You also have obviously the challenge that the the party and she in particular needs the party to be more powerful than the the companies. And so you went through that phase really badly. But what what they have seen is if they want to compete with the US on AI and this is worth taking a minute on. Um which they now know they need to. It's existential. They determined this about a year ago. It's existential to compete on AI. They need the private sector to do it. They watch what happens in the US. They see the US has so much more funding to AI because the markets work well. The equity market works well. It gets a tremendous amount of funding beyond what any government could do. And um and they've shifted. You've seen the shift bringing Alibaba back in. bringing saying okay we've got to go do this and um and they need the equity market to function to do it they know it and you've seen the shift there and they have incredible unlike Europe there's incredible technological ingenuity there that while they're behind in cutting edge AI they're probably on the cutting edge of applying AI in businesses in China</p>
</details>

债券和股票如何配置？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and bonds bonds and equities how you split it</p>
</details>

我认为债券在投资组合中仍有一席之地，但它们已经不是过去30年的样子了。这些财政极限非常重要。当你触及极限时，债券、股票和货币之间的相关性会突然改变。当财政政策成为如此强大的杠杆时，债券主要对冲的是主要的通缩和反通胀。但如果你相信如果出现反通胀，他们只会推动财政政策，那么债券的对冲效果就不那么好了。所以我认为债券面临风险，特别是考虑到即将到来的大规模供给。财政供给巨大，下一波AI浪潮也需要资金。AI生态系统过去是世界的净资本提供者，像微软、谷歌这样的公司利润丰厚。现在这种情况快结束了，他们基本上在花掉自己的现金流。你将面临财政和AI之间对资本的短缺，我认为这会给实际利率带来问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so bonds I I think are again depends a little bit on your starting point. I think most people got out of bonds when many of investors got out of bonds when interest rates were zero and interest rates have risen and real interest rates have risen such that there is a place for bonds in portfolios. But but I would say you really bonds are not what they were for the last 30 years that these fiscal limits are really important. All of a sudden the correlation between bonds and equities and currency will shift when you hit limits. In the UK, you have a different a very different diversifying instrument than you had before. And B, when fiscal policy is such a powerful lever, the big thing bonds diversify against our major deflations and disinflations. But if you believe there if there's a disinflation, they're going to just push on fiscal. They don't they don't hedge as well. So I think bonds are risky into this and particularly the massive supply that's coming that the fiscal supply massive the need now for the next wave of AI AI ecosystem used to be a net capital provider of the world the Microsofts the Googles they were so profitable they're they were buying back assets while investing a lot now you're about out of that they're basically spending their cash flow when you look across that ecosystem they need a lot of money you're seeing that in private credit and that's going to be sucking in money. So, you're going to have the shortage of capital both between fiscal and AI that's going to create, I think, problems, potential problems for real rates. Although, what's fighting against that is central banks in the US that want to drive down real rates. Um but uh but the the picture I would say is that um that you're going to have this big competition for capital between fiscal and AI. Moving from a world where you had an excess supply of capital because you had huge savings in Europe and in in Asia to a world where Europe, Asia, and the big tech companies were big savers to where Europe, Asia, and the big tech companies are becoming spenders.</p>

加密货币呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">crypto. What do you do with crypto?</p>
</details>

我的看法是，我在2012年左右开始研究加密货币，和研究AI差不多时间。我当时的想法至今没太大改变：这不是一项非常有用的技术。它让事情变得复杂。当时的使用场景主要是投机，而现在也基本如此。我当时认为，AI是对未来走向的更好赌注。当然，比特币有其一席之地，在这个不信任政府的世界里，拥有一种在全球范围内转移资金的方式，比特币显然是最佳选择。它在某些方面是黄金的替代品，尽管在很多方面又不是。但这个领域存在两个问题：一是存在非常严重的泡沫和腐败现象；二是它基本上是建立在一种处理信任问题的技术之上，但这使得它效率更低。生活在一个没有信任的世界里是一个非常低效的世界，而加密货币就代表了这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look, I think it's most there my view on this. I I started studying crypto in 20 around the same time I started studying AI. So 2012, 2013, 2014. My my thought then which hasn't changed much is this is not very helpful technology. This is a complicating thing and it's do you understand it? I think so. And my basic view of the use cases back then were mostly speculation and and and this the thing and the use cases have largely worked out that way. Um, and I thought at the time like AI is a much better bet on how the future will go than than crypto is with like I think there's obviously a place for Bitcoin in the sense that you um you if in this world if you don't trust governments and such having a way to move money around the world, Bitcoin is obviously the best choice. It is a replacement in some ways to gold although in many ways it's not. We could get into um and so I think that has some merit to it. You have the two problems of you have a very intense bubble corruption thing going on in that area and you have some Cryptocurrency was like a it was a magnet for the most corrupt people in finance. Um because there's low reg I mean just for the reasons low regulation. Is it is it still? Yeah. Um I think so. I mean bubbles are always but I I would say um the crypto area is just focused for that edge of corruption. If you look at the companies that just buy the Bitcoin and put in their treasury or whatever like the things going on there I don't think they're supported by the use cases and I think then the idea like it is possible because there is some good to the idea of taking a database and then distributing it so that no one person has that power. No one entity has that power. You get the need for that in this world, particularly in the world, but that's what it does. That's a more inefficient database. It may be more, it may be necessary because you can't trust anyone. But it's basically built on a technology that deals with a trust issue that makes it more inefficient. Living in a world with no trust is a very inefficient world. And crypto represents that.</p>

### 桥水的成功秘诀：知识复利与激进透明

为什么桥水如此成功？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Bridgewater. Why has Bridgewater been so successful?</p>
</details>

我认为桥水做得最重要的事情是，我们专注于两件事：如何深刻理解全球金融体系的运作方式，以及如何构建卓越的投资组合。为了推动这两件事，我们秉持一个理念：你必须通过“知识复利”来实现。你必须有纪律地写下你相信什么以及为什么相信，与他人分享，以便他们评估其中的对错，然后不断构建和累积理解。对我来说，专注于这些事情，形成一种关心这两件事如何运作的人才文化，然后将我们学到的一切有纪律地记录下来，转化为算法，并以此方式不断前进——这些就是神奇的要素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the most important thing that bridge order did well was to say a we're focused two things. How do you deeply understand how the global financial system works and how do you build great portfolios? Those are the two things that we do. And um and then to drive that the idea that you have to do that by compounding understanding. You have to have the discipline to write down what you believe and why you believe it. Share that with others so that they could assess what's wrong about that, what's right about that. Build that out and keep compounding understanding. So to me, basically the focus on those things, getting a culture of people who people who care deeply about how those two things work and then taking everything we ever learned and having the discipline to write it down, translate it into algorithms and keep moving forward that way. Those are the the the magical pieces.</p>
</details>

在一个组织内实现知识复利可能吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But is it possible to compound knowledge within an organization like that?</p>
</details>

我认为这非常非常困难，但我绝对认为这是可能的。我们建立了一个令人惊叹的系统，它不仅记录了我们所有的想法，还记录了这些想法如何变化，每次我们学到新东西时，我们用什么替换了什么。所有这些都是可用的。我可以进去看到一切。而且，AI可以阅读我们所有关于市场的信念、我们所有的规则、我们如何改变它们以及为什么改变它们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it's very very difficult but yeah I definitely think it is because I mean so now let's say now I joined Bridgewater. So how do so then I have access to everything you have ever thought? No because of security but but you but you could like meaning like if we if we didn't have security constraints we could make that all you could literally see everything. And one of the amazing things that we built, which I think is super important, is not only everything, how it changed, every time we learned something new, what we replaced with what we built, that's all available, right? I can go in there and see everything. And for what it's worth, AI could read over everything we've ever believed about markets, all the rules we had, how we changed them, why we changed them.</p>
</details>

为什么拥有这些很重要？因为你无法在大脑中记住所有你曾经思考过又忘记了的事情。我们有数百人研究过这些问题。我所说的“复利”，是指它必须是人类可读和计算机可读的。这意味着一个人必须能够拿起这个东西并理解它，而计算机必须能够运行它。拥有我们曾经相信的一切，这是极其强大的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and why is that good to have? because because you can't um you can't carry in your brain all of the things that you've thought about and forgotten not you not even just that you've done now we have hundreds of people that have studied these issues in China that if you start and you start from somebody's understanding that's been what we say is to compound it what I mean by that is it's got to be human readable and computer readable meaning like a human's got to be able to pick this thing up and make sense of it and a computer's got to be able to run it. Um, and that that is extremely extremely powerful to have that everything that we've ever believed.</p>
</details>

最难的是什么？是纪律。你当天并不需要它，你可能会想：“我为什么要写下我正在做的事情？”这需要极大的纪律，而人是懒惰的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what's the hardest thing doing it. The discipline. like you don't need it that day why am I writing down what I'm doing um and it just takes so much goddamn discipline and people are lazy. Um, and so</p>
</details>

你怎么强迫人们去做呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">how do you force people to do it?</p>
</details>

这非常难。我在2012年左右做了一件事，我说：“除非它被复利化，否则它就不存在。”你得不到任何奖励，你做的任何事都不算数。我不在乎你的结果有多好，如果那些知识没有进入我们称之为“安全花园”的地方，如果没有被转化为可复利的知识，它就不算数。零。你什么也得不到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it's super hard. So, the thing that I um did in 2012 versus maybe a little before that and I said it doesn't exist unless it's compounded. You get no, you don't get any bonus. Nothing that you did. I don't care how great your results were. I don't care what happened. If that knowledge is not in what we call our secure garden, but if it hasn't been translated into compounded knowledge, it does not count. Zero. You get nothing.</p>
</details>

在桥水，你们以**激进透明**（Radical Transparency: 一种组织文化，鼓励极高程度的开放和诚实沟通，包括分享决策过程、个人评估和会议记录，旨在促进基于事实的决策和持续改进）而闻名。这是真的吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">in poker you hide your cards. Uh in Bridgewater you are known for radical transparency, right? Is radical transparency real or is it like a storytelling thing?</p>
</details>

我认为激进透明至关重要。如果你想在一个社群中实现知识复利，你需要透明。我们说的是激进透明，我想把它和完全透明区分开来。这不意味着所有事情都完全透明，只是与大多数其他组织相比，它是激进地透明。如果你想得到最好的想法，你必须对抗某些人性。比如，大多数人喜欢秩序，喜欢由高层做决定。你需要对抗那些自然的政治倾向，让最好的想法胜出。其中一个关键部分就是，将高层做出的所有决定尽可能透明化，这样人们就可以对所有这些事情提出异议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, I think radical transparency is critical. If you come back to what's necessary to compound understanding in a community, right? Very different than it's an poker is an individual game. This is the kind of the problem. But if you want a compound understanding in a community, you need transparency. Now, we say radical transparency, and I want to differentiate that from complete transparency. That doesn't mean everything's complete transparency. It's just radically transparent, meaning like compared to most other organizations. And if you're trying to get to the best ideas, you have to fight against certain human things. Like humans, most humans like order. They like the person at the top to make the decision and whatever. You need to fight against the political things that are natural and allow the best ideas to win. And one part of that that's so critical is take all the decisions you make at the top and make them as transparent as you possibly can so people can push back on all of these things. And so for us, the radical transparency of saying, "Hey, we've got to share why we're doing what we're doing and take feedback on those things." I think that if you go back to things that made Bir successful, that is really important.</p>
</details>

你认为人们对你诚实吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you think do you think people are honest with you?</p>
</details>

我认为这是一个巨大的问题。人们必须对抗人性。看，我有权力，他们担心会冒犯我，或者担心我生他们的气。所以你如何对抗这一点？你要衡量并珍视它。我们发现，公司里最好的管理者是那些得到最多负面反馈的人。我们试图鼓励这一点。人们肯定对你有不好的看法，他们是独立的思考者，他们肯定认为你在搞砸事情。那些能够引出这些批评的管理者，我们有方法衡量你是否在引出对你的批评。公司里最差的管理者是那些他们的下属只说好话的人。所以我可以拿出我们的工具，你会看到我收到的难以置信的负面反馈。我仍然确信人们没有说出全部真相，但……

<details>

<p class="english-text">I think it's a huge um problem, right? People that's back to you have to fight human nature, right? Look, I'm powerful. They they they they worry about insulting me or whatever and worry about me being mad at them. So, how do you fight that? Right? A you measure and you treasure it, right? So a we look at the best managers in the company are the ones that get the most negative feedback. We try to encourage this. The only people think terrible things about you. They must they're independent thinkers. They must think you're screwing things up. They're smart people. The people that are able to draw that out, which we measure. We have ways of measuring are you drawing out the criticism about you. The worst managers in the company are the ones that their people say all good things about. So I could whip out our tool here, but you could see the incredible amount of negative feedback I get. And I'm still sure that people don't tell the total truth or anything like that, but you are</p>

I thought it was a small thing like meaning like and and my like I and and just yesterday one of the members of the team was talking about how the things some of the things I've been wrong about that I mercurialism being one like I thought it would have bigger impact than it has as an example and that I kind of can explain it away um a little bit like I did today well there was AI on this side and um and so I get this feedback and I do you ever think you know what I've been doing this for 30 years I'm stinking rich I uh I know what I talk about and here you are 26 year old and you're telling me what to do. Exactly. And so and that's the thing back like and that's the worst of me. Right. And if you know it and you expose it and you help other people show it to you when you're doing it, that's great, right? The same thing as the 26-year-old. Like you got to flip that on the other side. The 26-year-old's unlikely to say it to you. Even though man, how much better off are you to have these observations about yourself? There's no actual downside. There's only downside because you're a weak, fallible human. Like, what's what's the actual downside? If I listen and think hard about, wait, what am I missing? I'm still rich. I'm still like um and if I don't, I miss out on all of these jewels. So, I am definitely flawed in that. I feel it. I feel that anger. I feel that like, who the are you? Uh, sorry about that.
