title: 从AI伴侣到个人软件：AI驱动的个性化应用与未来内容生态
---

### AI的现状与未来愿景

Eugenia: 目前，**AI**（人工智能）只是你手机上的一个应用程序，它不应该仅仅如此。有时候，你需要放手一搏，孤注一掷。如果缺乏这样做的勇气，尤其是在当前环境下，你可能会承担后果。在这一领域，开发者中存在一个巨大的思维误区，他们总觉得语音是主要的交互界面。这可能是因为他们一直在错误地思考电影《**Her**》（《她》）中的情节。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right now, AI is just an app on your phone. It should not be that way. Sometimes you need to sort of go big or go home. Not having the balls to do that, especially in this current environment, you can suffer the consequences. There's a huge mind trap that exists among builders in the space where they somehow think that voice is the main interface. That's because they are somehow thinking about the movie Her all the time but not in the right way.</p>
</details>

主持人: 那么，您在这个领域是真正的先驱，在其他人开始之前就已经涉足了。也许您可以谈谈您对这个类别如何演变的反思，以及您是如何帮助创建它的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you were a true pioneer in the space before everyone else was doing it. Um maybe just talk about your reflections of how that category has has as you helped create it and then how how it's evolved.</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 它确实进化了，我注意到了，这太不可思议了。我们坚信它会发生，但当它真正发生时，我们仍然感到非常惊讶。我想这只是，它仍然感觉像完全的魔法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It definitely evolved, I've noticed. It's pretty crazy. We had a very strong belief that it would happen but we still were so surprised when it actually happened. I guess this was just it just still felt like complete magic.</p>
</details>

主持人: 很高兴能深入了解您在**Wabby**（演讲者创立的个性化应用平台）所做的一切。首先，让我们稍微梳理一下背景。回顾您职业生涯的轨迹，也许是过去十年，您如何将**Replica**（演讲者创立的AI伴侣应用）、Wabby等贯穿其中的主线进行情境化？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Jenna, excited to get into everything you're doing with Wabby. First, let's contextualize this a little bit. When you look back at sort of the arc of of your career, perhaps the last decade, how do you contextualize what is the through line, you know, through Replica, Wabby, etc.?</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 哦，哇。这是一个很难的问题，但我想也许主要的主题是我们总是走在前沿。有时有点太早，有时希望这次是恰到好处的早，但总的来说，是的，我从2012年就开始从事AI工作，那是在十多年前。我一直着迷于能够与机器对话，进行有意义的对话的想法，但更重要的是，这种对话能够以一种非常好的方式影响你的生活。在此之前，重点是那些**AI伴侣**（AI companions）、AI朋友，它们能够真正陪伴你，帮助你过上更好的生活，帮助你感觉更好。现在我想，这只是同样的想法，但应用于**个人软件**（personal software），比如我们能否构建许多应用程序或软件，以一种非常个性化的方式全天候帮助我们，并专注于你，帮助你过上更好的生活。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, wow. That's a um that's a hard question, but I guess the maybe the main theme uh is we're always early. Sometimes a little bit too early, sometimes hopefully this time around, you know, uh the right the right kind of early, the right type of early, but generally, yeah, I've started uh working on AI in 2012, so over a decade ago. um and was always fascinated by kind of the idea that you'll be able to talk to um to a machine to have a good convers meaningful conversation with a machine but more importantly with the fact that that could influence your life um in a really good way and before that was really the focus was on these AI companions AI friends that could really be there for you and help you live a better life help you feel better and now I guess it's just the same idea but applied to personal software like can we build many apps or software that will really help us throughout the day in a very personal way and we'll be focused on you on helping you live a better life.</p>

### 从命令行到可视化界面：AI应用的演变

主持人: 请描述一下您是如何对这个新类别感到兴奋的，以及您希望它会变成什么样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Trace the journey of how you got excited about this new category and uh what you hope it becomes.</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 我想在运营Replica期间，我们总是与用户讨论他们还使用哪些其他产品以及他们如何使用AI。我总是觉得很奇怪，他们使用像**ChatGPT**（由OpenAI开发的大型语言模型）、**Gemini**（谷歌开发的AI模型）或**Claude**（Anthropic开发的AI模型）这样的产品，但实际上他们主要用于非常简单的用例，比如他们使用ChatGPT只是为了搜索，或者帮助他们写一些东西，帮助做作业或其他事情。没有人真正提到我们不断看到的模型所具备的那些令人兴奋的功能。因此，我们觉得一定存在界面问题。当人们看到**命令行界面**（command line）或聊天机器人时，他们真的只看到了搜索、写作工具。也许我可以和它对话。但如果你考虑到那只是命令行界面的功能，这些并不是主要用例。我认为即使最近，OpenAI也发布了一项研究，表明这些确实是ChatGPT的主要用例。我想所有使用量的三分之一都围绕着写作或写作辅助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I guess while running Replica, we always had these conversations with our users about what other products they use and how they use AI. And it always struck me as strange uh that they were using products like CHP or Gemini Claude, but really they were mostly using it for very simple use cases like they were using Chik to just you for search or to help them write something uh help with homework or something else. And no one was really mentioning any of these, you know, exciting capabilities that we just kept seeing the models, you know, get. Um, and so we felt like there must be an interface problem. Uh, when people look at a command line or a chatbot, they really just see um, you know, search writing tool. Maybe I can talk to this. But if you think about that's the affordance of a command line like not really these are the main use cases. I think even recently tragic open I published one of those uh research whatever one of those studies showing that these are in fact the main use cases for tragic. I think a third of all all of the use was around writing um or writing help. Um and so that gave us an idea that there should be some next interface. There should be something else on top of this.</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 于是我们有了一个想法，应该有下一个界面。应该在此之上有一些其他的东西。应该有一些更具互动性、可视化、简单的东西，让包括我在内的每个人都能真正发现所有这些模型已经具备的惊人用例。所以我们开始思考，我们痴迷于这样一个比喻：当前的聊天机器人实际上是AI界面领域的**Microsoft DOS**（Microsoft Disk Operating System: 微软磁盘操作系统）时代，未来将出现某种**Windows**（Windows操作系统）或**Mac OS**（Mac操作系统）时刻。我想对大多数人来说，令人困惑的部分是聊天机器人无论如何都有如此大的吸引力。近十亿人已经在使用这些AI工具，但他们只将它们用于这些更简单的用例。为了解锁其他功能，你需要一个更令人兴奋的界面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There should be something more interactive, visual, simple for um everyone, me included, to actually discover these amazing use cases that all these models already have. And so we started thinking, we got obsessed with this metaphor that the current chat bots are really the Microsoft DOSs era for AI um interfaces and that there will be some sort of a Windows Mac OS moment. Um, and I think the confusing part for for most people is that there is so much traction with chatbots anyway. Um, almost a billion people using these AI tools uh already, but they only use them for these kind of simpler use cases. And in order to unlock something else, you need a more exciting interface.</p>
</details>

主持人: 请更具体地描绘一下，当这个Windows或Mac OS时刻到来时，世界会是什么样子？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Paint more of a picture of what the world will look like when this Windows or Mac OS moment happened. What will that look like?</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 嗯，我认为现在我们存在于这样一个范式中，你知道，我小时候有电视，也许有几十个电视频道。在俄罗斯，我们只有六个电视频道。当然，现在电视仍然存在，但我们现在看**YouTube**（视频分享平台）、Reels和**TikTok**（短视频平台），很多**UGC**（User-Generated Content: 用户生成内容）内容。我想同样的事情也会发生在软件上。现在我们有点被困在这个世界上，只有少数由专业开发者开发的应用程序。然后最终，我们当然会进入一个新世界，应用程序由我们所有人为我们所有人构建，也许有时由AI为我们构建。所以如果你想想，未来的操作系统，你打开它，你会看到你经常使用的常规流行应用程序。也许是Instagram或其他什么。然后你可能会看到一些你发现的很酷的应用程序，你的好朋友正在使用，或者你自己构建的，或者你为你自己修改了你找到的一个应用程序。然后你会看到AI为你推荐一些应用程序。也许你下周要去纽约，你对艺术感兴趣，所以它为你制作了一个艺术展查找应用程序，它会帮助你找到你住的**Airbnb**（爱彼迎: 短期租赁平台）附近的艺术展。所以它更加灵活、可塑，并且深度个性化。把它想象成一个建立在你这个平台上的操作系统，而不是建立在某个随机的固定上下文上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I do think right now we exist um in the paradigm of, you know, when I was growing up, we had TV and um you know, here you had maybe a few dozen TV channels. Back in Russia, we only had six TV channels. Um and so then of course now uh TV still exists, but when now we watch YouTube and reals and Tik Tok, a lot of UGC stuff. And so I think the same will happen with um software. Right now we're kind of stuck in this world where are these few apps developed by professional developers. Um and then eventually of course we're going to move on to this new world where apps are built by all of us for all of us and maybe so and maybe sometimes by AI for us. So if you think about it the operating system of the future you open it up and you see your regular popular apps you use all the time. Maybe it's a maybe it's Instagram whatever it is. Um, and then you see maybe some cool apps that you discovered uh your friend your best friend's using or maybe you built for yourself or you tweaked one of the apps you found for yourself and then you'll see AI suggesting some apps for you. Maybe you're going to New York next week and there's you're into art so it made an art show finder app for you uh which is going to help you find art shows around the Airbnb you're staying at. So it's a lot more flexible, malible, and very deeply personalized. Think of it as an operating system built on the platform of you and not on some random um fixed context.</p>
</details>

主持人: 您能谈谈这个吗？我们一直认为软件必须是持久的，因为它制作成本很高，而且看起来很严肃。您想象中会存在哪些类型的短暂软件，比如纽约艺术画廊应用程序？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">context. C can you talk about that? Like how we've always had this idea that software has to be durable because it's really expensive to make and it seems really serious. Like what types of ephemeral software like the New York Art Gallery app do you imagine existing?</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 嗯，现在我们已经看到大量的早期用户正在构建一些非常具体的应用程序，这些应用程序永远不会出现在应用商店中。它们太小了，太个性化了，太小众了。它们没有2万个功能。比如有人构建了一个励志名言应用程序，它只从一个我甚至一无所知的特定节目中提取内容，但他非常痴迷于那个节目。所以他只是想在早上5:30醒来时看到它。我觉得人们正在构建非常具体的东西来满足他们的需求。比如前几天我哄孩子睡觉，我女儿想玩这些拼图游戏。当我告诉她一些东西时，她会尝试猜测那是什么。所以我们很快就构建了一个游戏，它是一个拼图，然后她看到四张图片，她可以点击其中一张，但她也希望这些图片是关于艾莎公主和茉莉公主的。所以我们必须把这些元素融入进去。她非常高兴，因为她现在正在玩这些拼图，学习新东西，然后我们把它改成意大利语，因为她上的是意大利语学前班。所以这是另一种练习方式。她非常兴奋。我们整个晚上都放不下这个东西。我花了2分钟来构建它，然后几秒钟来调整它，而不是去应用商店。我甚至不知道是否有这样的应用程序存在，而且还要经历15分钟的入职流程，付费，然后再付费，然后它也不是她真正想要的。那里没有个性化。所以我想这些就是这样的用例应该发生的地方。我确实认为在未来，我应该能够直接说“嘿，我正在哄孩子睡觉”，或者它应该知道这个上下文，然后直接推荐一些已经为我预先构建好的应用程序，我可以直接使用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, so right now we're already seeing tons of, you know, some of their first users building very specific apps that would never exist in on the app store. They're just too small. They're too personalized, too niche. They don't have, you know, 20,000 features. Like someone built um a a motivational quote app that's only pulling from like one particular show that I didn't even know anything about, but he's really obsessed with that show. And so he just wants that at 5:30 a.m. when he wakes up. Um it's really I feel like people are building very particular things um to fit their needs like right around for example I was uh putting my kids to bed the other day and my daughter wants to play these puzzle games. When I tell her something she's trying to guess what it is and so she we we built a game very quickly where it's a puzzle and then she sees four pictures she can click on one but she also wanted them to be about Princess Elsa and Princess Jasmine. And so we had to incorporate that. And so now she was so happy because now she's doing these puzzles, learning something new, and then we change it to Italian because she goes to an Italian preschool. And so this is another way to practice. And she's so excited. We spend the whole like we couldn't put this thing away. Um, and it took me 2 minutes to build it and then, you know, few seconds to tweak it versus going on the app store. I don't even know if an app like that exists, and going through 15 minute onboarding, paying paying again, then it's not really what she wanted. um there's no personalization there. So I think these are the use cases where something like that um you know should should happen and I do think in the future I should just be able to say hey I'm you know putting my kids to bed or it should know that context and just in you know maybe suggest a few apps that already pre-built for me that I could use right now.</p>
</details>

主持人: 这很有趣。我刚买了一部新**iPhone**（苹果手机），在新手机上，我删除了很多旧应用程序，因为我喜欢重新开始。我下载了可能十几个应用程序，有些甚至付费了，但我现在完全不需要它们了，因为我在Wabby上构建了更好的版本。从偏头痛跟踪到餐厅推荐跟踪，再到高度个性化的笔记应用程序，再到特定风格的图像转换特殊功能。我想很多人都会有这种感觉，就是不用再去找那些充斥着疯狂广告、不断弹出窗口、难以使用且不为你个性化的长尾应用程序，你可以在Wabby上即时制作你想要的东西并进行调整，这是这个产品另一个非常酷的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's funny. I just got a new iPhone and um on the new phone I got to to delete a bunch of my old apps cuz I like to start fresh and there were like probably over a dozen apps that I downloaded and in some cases paid for that I just totally didn't need anymore because I had built better versions of it on hobby. Everything from like migraine tracking to like tracking restaurant recommendations to like a really hyperpersonalized notes app to special things around image transformation in a particular style. And I can imagine that will be true for a lot of people, which is like instead of having to find this longtail app that's running all these crazy ads, popups all the time, and is hard to use and is not personalized to you, you can just make exactly what you want on the fly and and tweak it, which is another really cool part of the product. I think this is what and I'm so glad to hear that you're using it. But um for me that was the the kind of the product market fit with Wabby for me was around that where I found there were a few things I really needed and wanted an app for to track my weightlifting very beginner weightlifting workouts. I just figured out you got to go up in weight. This is I didn't know I would know a woman. Anyway, so I got this app and I was tracking it in app notes and I tried to find some apps on the app store and they're just</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 我很高兴听到您正在使用它。对我来说，Wabby的**产品市场契合**（product market fit）就在于此。我发现有几件事我非常需要，并想要一个应用程序来跟踪我的举重训练，非常初级的举重训练。我刚刚发现你需要增加重量。我不知道我会认识一个女人。总之，我得到了这个应用程序，我在应用程序笔记中跟踪它，我试图在应用商店中找到一些应用程序，但它们只是……

<p class="english-text">I think this is what and I'm so glad to hear that you're using it.

</details>

主持人: 这些应用程序里有太多我不需要的东西，所以我只是想要一个非常简单的……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">there's just so much in these apps that I didn't need and so I just wanted a really simple</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 我也想遵循一本特定的书。我希望训练是基于那本书的。所以，总之，我构建了一个简单的应用程序来跟踪这些训练。然后现在，每次我去健身房，我都是在去健身房的路上构建的，但现在每次我去健身房，我都会发现一些我想添加到其中的东西。最初它只是一个追踪器。现在它根据我的所有输入生成新的训练，我在哪里，你知道，我正在尝试遵循的那本书，或者像渐进式超负荷的**阶梯技术**（ladder technique）之类的。所以我把所有这些都放到了**提示词**（prompt）中，每次我去健身房，我都会添加一点。我想要多一点这个，多一点那个。所以现在我不仅仅是使用这个应用程序。我一直在不断地调整它，并将其重新发布到Wabby的迷你应用商店。希望有人会觉得它有用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm also trying to follow one particular book. I wanted the workouts to be based on that book. So anyway, I built a simple app to track these workouts. Um and then now anytime I go to the gym, I built it on the way to the gym, but now anytime I go to the gym, I find something else I want to add to it. First it was just a tracker. Now it's generating new workouts based on all of my inputs where I am mad, you know, the the the the book I'm I'm trying to follow whatever the ladder technique of like progressive overload. And so I put it all in the prompt and every time I go to the gym, I add a little bit to that. I want a little more of this, a little more of that. So now I'm not just using the app. I'm kind of the constantly in the process of tweaking it and republishing it to Wabby kind of mini app store. Hopefully someone will find it find it useful.</p>

### 用户生成软件与社区构建

主持人: 您认为有多少人，或者说您的受众中，您认为会是90%的消费和10%的创作，还是您认为大多数人……例如，我们从**Sora**（OpenAI的文本到视频生成模型）中看到的一件事是，很多人，大多数人都在创作。您认为Wabby也会是这样吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How how many people do you think or you know generally as you think your audience do you think it will be 9010 sort of consumption creation or do you think that most people I think one of the things we saw with Sora for example is that many people the majority of people are creating. Do you think that Wabby will be like that?</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 我希望更多的人至少会进行调整，但我认为完全原创的创作者可能仍然不到10%。我们目前正在做的是，本周我们将发布一个大的更新，即社交图谱。所以你将能够看到谁正在下载哪些迷你应用程序，他们如何使用它们。你将能够看到评论或点赞迷你应用程序。在这种情况下，例如，如果我创建了那个健身应用程序，评论中的某人可以要求我调整它。他们也可以重新混合并更改它。你知道，他们可以随心所欲地更改应用程序。但也许他们只是希望这个特定的应用程序稍微有所不同。所以他们可以在评论中提出，也许你知道，作为创作者，我当然会阅读所有评论并更改应用程序，以便这些人也能使用它。所以我觉得这很酷，因为它突然创造了……这不仅仅是为自己构建应用程序。它实际上是关于发现应用程序，找到你的朋友正在使用的应用程序，一起使用这些应用程序，等等，甚至要求创作者以某种特定方式更改它们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I hope that more people will at least tweak but I'd say like fully kind of original creators probably still under 10%. And what we're working on right now this week we're releasing we're pushing sort of a big update u the social graph. So you'll be able to see who is downloading what mini apps how they're using them. You're going to be able to see um comments or like mini apps. And so in this case for example if I created that workout app someone in comments can ask me to tweak it. They can also remix it and change it. You know obviously change the app however they want. But maybe they just want this particular app to be slightly different. So they could put in comments and maybe you know as a creator of course I'm going to be reading all the comments and changing the app to also um you know for these people to be able to use it. So I think this is cool because it creates all of a sudden um it's not just about building apps for yourself. It's really about discovering apps and finding what your friends are using using these apps together um and so on so on and even asking creators to you know change them in some particular way.</p>
</details>

主持人: 太棒了。稍微放大一点，或者转个话题，Anish和Justine，我们一直在讨论的关于个人软件的类别或主题，与我们在投资方面一直在探索的主题有什么关系？是什么让我们对此感到兴奋？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Amazing. Zooming out a bit um or segueing uh Anish and Justine, how do the categories or the topics that we've been discussing as it relates to personal software relate to themes that we've been exploring on the investing side in terms of you know what what got us excited here? Yeah, I mean look, I I</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 是的，我的意思是，我认为Eugenia提出的YouTube比喻是正确的，那就是我们可能在2007年的时候会说100个有线电视频道就足够了，或者在您的情况下是六个。而现在，显然存在一个完整的生态系统，从开箱视频到所有YouTube原生内容。我想人们拥有更多的内容，也因此感到更加满足。然后还有积极的创作。有些人为了商业而创作，但很多人只是因为自我实现而创作和发布。而软件一直以来都非常受限制，因为世界上只有2000万开发者。所以，从某种意义上说，我们消费的所有软件都受制于这2000万人的偏好。直观来看，如果更多人能够制作软件，那么这里就会有一个大众消费产品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">think that the YouTube metaphor is the right one that Eugenia outlined, you know, which is that we would have said in 2007 that 100 cable channels is enough or or six in your case. And you know, now obviously there's this entire ecosystem, everything from unboxing videos to all of the like very YouTube native content that exists. Um, and I think people are sort of have more content are more fulfilled by it. And then there's also the active creation. Some people create for a business, but many create and post just because it's fulfilling to themselves. And software has just been so restrictive because there's only 20 million developers in the world, you know. So, in a sense, all of the software that we consume is downstream of the preferences of those 20 million people. And it seems intuitive that if more people could make software, they would there would be a mass market consumer product here.</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 我认为与其他许多产品不同，您应该对此发表评论，我们看到的，这感觉不像**文本到应用**（text to app），你知道，它不是一个开发者或开发者辅助工具，它真的是一个面向非技术人员的大众消费产品。我同意您的观点，我们很早就做出了这样的选择，我们绝不会在应用程序中展示任何代码或任何哪怕是稍微技术性的东西，没有**API密钥**（API keys），没有“连接这个集成”或类似的东西。我们确实有集成功能。你可以添加你的应用程序和服务，但你只需说“使用我的**Apple Health**（苹果健康）”或“使用这个”、“使用那个”，或者“使用我的电子邮件”。我们称它们为“**增强应用**”（power apps）。这可能是您在这里能遇到的最技术性的东西了。但我们希望，是的，我们希望让任何人都能非常简单地制作应用程序，并让这个过程非常愉快。几乎感觉你只是在快速创建一些东西，你甚至不是真的在构建迷你应用程序。我们现在正在添加的，我想我们最关注的公司或产品是**Canva**（在线设计工具），以及他们让人们轻松创建精美演示文稿的方式。这里也需要发生类似的事情。现在我们谈论了很多**Vibe Coding**（一种通过自然语言或简单操作进行编程的方式），但我觉得我们应该更多地关注Vibe设计这些应用程序。所以，我们将提供更多的可视化控制，更像是选择一种风格，选择一些颜色。你可以深入一点，但实际上它只是一个按钮，东西看起来就很棒，而不是你需要深入研究并真正尝试理解该做什么，并在你的迷你应用程序中变得技术化。我确实认为这会释放一定程度的创造力，你只需要考虑用例是什么。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I think unlike many of the other products and you should comment on this that we've seen it feels like this is not text to app you know it's not a developer or developer adjacent tool it's truly a mass market consumer product for nontechnical people we I agree with you and we really made this kind of choice early on that we're never going to show any code or anything or say anything in the app that's even remotely technical no API keys no uh bring this whatever connect this integration or anything like that. Uh we do have integrations. You can add your apps and services but you can just say you know use my Apple Health or use this use that um or use my email. Um and we call them power apps. So that's sort of a more probably the most technical you're going to get here. But we wanted so yeah we wanted to make it super simple for anyone to make apps and to make this process very delightful. Um and almost to feel like you're just creating something really quick. you're not even really building many apps. Um, what we're adding right now is more I think the the company or the product we're looking at most most is Canva and the ease with which they're they're letting people create beautiful presentations. The similar kind of similar thing needs to needs to happen here. Right now we're talking about VIP coding a lot, but I feel like we should be more about Vibe kind of taste or VIP designing these apps. So, we're going to give a lot more of the just visual controls, more in the vein of like choose a style, choose, you know, some colors. You can go a little bit deeper, but really it's just one button and things look great versus um yeah, you need to go deep and just really um try to understand what to do and get technical with your mini app. Um and I do think that unlocks a certain level of creativity where all you need to think about is like what's the use case.</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 另一个有趣的事情是，我们的一位投资者**Soleo**提到，应用程序，迷你应用程序可以成为社区的启动器。所以，如果今天应用商店非常不社交化，而且可能永远不会社交化，因为**Apple**（苹果）对隐私的强制要求以及这对他们来说是多么重要。这很棒，但同时你可能确实想知道还有谁对彼得希尔的幼儿活动感兴趣。我想知道还有哪些妈妈的孩子上意大利语学前班。我想让他们知道我的孩子也上那个学前班。也许我的设计师对伦敦他所在社区的观鸟很感兴趣。所以创建那个应用程序并找到一些其他人，你知道，可以围绕那个话题建立一个小型社区。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, one other interesting thing that one of our uh, investors Soleo mentioned was that apps, many apps could become kind of community starters. So, if today the app store is very much not social and it probably won't ever be social because of Apple's mandate for obviously privacy and how important that is for them. um which is great but in at the same time you probably do want to know who else is into I don't know toddler activities in Peter Hill. Um I want to know what other moms are going to an Italian preschool. Um I want to you know have their kids go to that preschool. Uh and maybe I don't know my designer is really into bird watching in London um in his particular neighborhood. So creating that app and finding some other people who, you know, could be a little bit of a community building um around that topic.</p>

主持人: 是的，我认为你们在产品设计中做出了一系列非常有趣的选择，感觉就像真正建立在Vibe Coding或使用AI构建的爆炸式增长之上，无论你想怎么称呼它，以一种超级有趣的方式。其中之一就是，是的，对于许多消费者来说，现有工具比从头开始编写代码更容易访问，但仍然很容易出错或陷入不知所措的境地。而我认为Wabby，你们特意在体验周围设置了护栏，使其很难彻底搞砸，这对消费者来说非常有帮助。然后也感觉，你知道，我们需要超越这种范式，比如你Vibe Coding了一个网站，它确实存在，但那真的是你日常使用产品、存储个人信息、拥有自己的记录以及所有这些事情的最佳界面吗？可能不是。对于很多人来说，他们的手机是他们大部分时间在线的地方。它是他们主要的界面，也是他们想使用东西的地方。嗯，所以显然我知道设计移动端存在挑战等等，但对你们来说，从那里开始是一个非常明智的选择，这样才能更深入地融入某人的日常生活或日常工作流程。

<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think there's a bunch of really interesting choices you guys made in designing the product that it feels like really built on the explosion in like vibe coding or building with AI, whatever you want to call it, in a super interesting way. One of which is like, yeah, for many consumers the existing tools are a lot more accessible than like coding something from scratch, but it's still pretty easy to like break them or get to something where you don't know what to do. Whereas I think Wabby, you've purposely put guard rails around the experience to make it hard to like super mess up, which is extremely helpful for consumers. And then it also feels like, you know, we needed to move beyond this paradigm of like great you vibe code a website and it it exists out there, but like is that the best interface for you to be using a product you want to use daily and storing personal information on and having your own records and like all of these sorts of things? Probably not. And for a lot of people like their phone is where they spend most of their time online. It's kind of their primary interface and where they want to use things. Um, and so obviously I know there's like challenges designing for mobile and that sort of thing, but it it felt like a really smart choice for you guys to start there just to get so much more deeply ingrained in someone's daily life or daily workflow.</p>

Eugenia: 我确实喜欢移动应用程序的想法，很多事情你不会在网站上或任何链接上做。我非常相信**组织层**（organizational layer）的概念。在某种程度上，应用商店是移动端的组织层，浏览器是互联网的组织层。所以，类似的东西应该存在于Vibe Coding，或者说这个新的软件时代，或者称之为AI软件。我确实相信我们都会构建某种软件，并使用每个人构建的软件，一些UGC软件，但我绝对不相信人们会互相分享链接，让我依赖某个地方的某个非专业人士来支持我可能存储敏感数据，或者至少是不想丢失的数据（即使它不那么敏感）的应用程序的数据库。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If I really like the idea of mobile apps and a lot of things you're not going to be doing on, you know, really just putting in a website or whatever, some linkact. Um and I do believe a lot in the concept of an organizational layer like to a degree um the app store is the organizational layer for um you know the the mobile and um the browser the organizational layer for internet and so something like that should exist for coding I guess or for this new era of software for AI put let's call it AI software um and I don't believe that people will be I do believe that we're all going to be building some sort of software in using software that everyone builds some UGC software but I definitely don't believe in links that people will share with each other and with me relying on some random person somewhere who's not a professional developer to support the database for the app where I might store some sensitive data or at least data that I don't want to disappear even if it's not very sensitive</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 我们已经看到一些Vibe Coding的应用程序登上了应用商店的榜首，我想是关于女性约会的应用程序，所有超级敏感的信息都被泄露了，那不是因为他们是坏人。只是他们不是专业的开发者。所以需要有一个平台，所有东西都将存在于此。在某种程度上，我们不是在某个地方看视频，而是在Instagram、TikTok、YouTube上看视频，人们不是互相传递链接。所以目前的状况，我确实认为与互联网的早期非常相似，那时人们使用**GeoCities**（雅虎早期提供的免费个人网页服务）和其他类似的工具创建个人页面，我不太记得了，因为那很少见。但在**LinkedIn**（职业社交平台）出现之前，人们互相发送这些链接，当然现在有了LinkedIn，有一些护栏，你不能像在GeoCities那样做所有事情，但同时你拥有这个社交图谱，你拥有这个平台，你拥有各种很酷的东西。就像**Shopify**（电商平台）之于电子商务一样，是的，你可以建立自己的在线商店，但现在没有人真正这样做了，每个人都只是使用Shopify，然后他们也获得了所有平台的好处。我觉得Wabby也会发生同样的事情，是的，你不能从Wabby下载一个应用程序并把它放到应用商店，但你可以在Wabby内部使用它，你可以获得社交图谱和所有集成，以及所有应用程序之间潜在的共享上下文和用户背后的记忆等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh and we've already seen this with some apps vipcoded apps reaching the top of the app store I think the around women dating that all the super sensitive information got leaked and that wasn't because they are bad actors. It's just they're not professional developers. So there needs to exist some some platform where everything will live and to a degree we're not watching videos somewhere uh you see videos somewhere we're watching them on Instagram on Tik Tok on YouTube it's not like people are passing around links and so the current situation I do think is very similar to the very beginning of the internet where people were creating personal pages with geio cities and some other tools like that which I don't remember very very well because it was very little but um yeah before link LinkedIn people were sending these links to each other and of course now there's LinkedIn there are certain guardrails you can't really do everything the way you could do in geo cities but at the same time you have this get the social graph you get the platform you get all sorts of cool things there get the same as Shopify for e-commerce yeah you can build your own uh online store but no one's really doing it anymore everyone's just using Shopify and then they also get the all the platform benefits and I feel like the same will happen with Wabby yes you cannot download an app from Wabby and put on the app store, but you can use it inside Wii and you can get the social graph and all the integrations and the potentially the shared context between all the apps and the memory behind you know for for that um user and so on so on so on.</p>

### 记忆、上下文与表达的框架

主持人: 我们的共同朋友**Heaton**说Wabby不仅仅是应用程序的集合。它是一个记忆、上下文和表达的框架。每次你创建或分享，你都在教它你是谁。您是这样看待它的吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh our mutual friend Heaton said that Wabby is not just a collection of apps. It's a framework for memory, context and expression. Every time you create or share, you're teaching it who you are. Is is that how you see it?</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 我百分之百相信这一点。我认为每一次……我仍然记得，当然你们也记得，但我确实记得第一批**iOS**（苹果移动操作系统）应用程序只是人们试图将网站挤压成应用程序格式，或者只是像“I Beer”这样的玩具应用程序，或者我最喜欢的一个“I Am Rich”，售价999.99美元，它什么也做不了。然后当然人们明白了，嗯，你知道，作为移动应用程序，它有一些特别之处，也许是GPS和连接性，以及像**Uber**（优步: 网约车平台）和**Tinder**（探探: 约会应用）这样的东西出现了，开创了全新的应用程序类别，所以他们弄清楚了移动端有什么特别之处。我觉得对于AI来说，最特别的事情是**个性化**（personalization），而且是真正深度的个性化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I believe in it 100%. I think with every um I believe I still remember of course and you guys obviously remember too but I do remember how the first iOS apps were just people trying to squeeze those websites into an app format or just kind of toy apps like I beer or there was my favorite one I am rich that was $999.99 and it didn't it didn't do anything. Um, and then of course people figure out, well, you know, there's some something special about this being a mobile mobile app and maybe GPS and connectivity and things like Uber and Tinder came out a whole new categories of apps and so they figured out what's so special about mobile and I feel like for AI the super special thing is uh personalization but really deep personalization.</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 所以对我来说，Vibe Coding一个应用程序，但它仍然是那种没有真正考虑你的任何上下文的旧软件，应用程序的数据没有暴露给不断学习的AI。这有点老派。我非常相信**Andre Karpathy**（安德烈·卡帕西: 知名AI研究员）的“**软件3.0**”（Software 3.0: Andre Karpathy提出的软件开发新范式）理念，即下一个层次的软件是超级深度个性化的。所以如果你在Wabby迷你应用程序的上下文中思考，你如何个性化它？首先，你可以个性化功能、外观，你知道，我以某种方式美化了应用程序。但在此之上，你还可以更改提示词。例如，对于我的健身应用程序，我在提示词中添加了几件事。首先，我正在阅读的那本书，我希望使用那种方法进行锻炼。另外，我去的是一个健身房，它有特定的……我添加了那个健身房的照片。所以模型不会在完全不同大小的健身房中生成训练。如果它是一个超级大的健身房，就必须彼此相邻。所以这是深度、深度、深度级别的个性化。当然，在Wabby平台层面，迷你应用程序也知道我多大年纪，我住在旧金山，我有孩子，这些是我的健身目标等等。然后最终，当我构建另一个迷你应用程序时，也许是关于营养的，这些应用程序应该能够相互交流并传递上下文。而今天，当然，所有这些都存在于**围墙花园**（walled gardens）中。你完全被锁定在一个应用程序中，这对我来说感觉绝对疯狂。而且我无法连接，如果我连接了我的电子邮件或我的日历。它无法连接到这两个应用程序。我必须每次都与每个开发者经历这个过程。他们必须构建它。我必须连接它。这对我来说似乎很疯狂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So for me, kind of vibe coding an app, but that still is sort of like the same old software that's not really taken any of your context into consideration where the data of that app is not exposed to AI that keeps learning. It's kind of just old school. I do believe a lot in Andre's um uh idea of like software 3.0, some next level of software that's super deeply personalized. So if you think in the context of a Wabi mini app, how can you personalize it? First of all, you can personalize the features, the looks, um, you know, where I've skinned the app in a a certain way. But then on top of that, you can also change the prompt. So, for example, for my workout app, um, I added to the prompt a couple things. First of all, the book that I'm reading that that method that I want to work out using that method. Also, the fact that I go to as a fitness and it has a certain I added a photo of that gym. So, kind of the model is not generating workouts in a completely different size of the gym. uh if it's a super side has to be next to each other. Uh so this is the deep deep deep level of personalization that that is following. And of course on the Wabby platform level the the mini app also knows that I'm a certain age that I live in San Francisco that I have kids these are my fitness goals and so on so on. And then eventually when I when I build another mini app maybe around nutrition those apps should be able to talk and pass along that context. And today, of course, all of that exists in just the, you know, the walled gardens. You're fully locked in in one app, which is to me feels absolutely crazy. Um, and I can't connect, if I connected my email or my calendar. It can't be connected to both of these apps. I have to go through the process with every developer all the time. They have to build it. I have to connect it. That seems crazy to me.</p>
</details>

主持人: 您是否设想人们会构建真正的社交应用程序，其中应用内体验涉及社区？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Do you imagine people building true social apps where the inapp experience involves a community?</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 我很喜欢那样。我们现在正在构建多人游戏功能。我们花了一整天的时间试图弄清楚，这真的很复杂，因为所有应用程序都可以有非常不同类型的多人游戏功能，而且需要以一种非常直观的方式向用户解释。但是的，我完全相信首先是与朋友、家人一起使用应用程序，但也可能构建这些更多社区应用程序，每个人都可以加入。也许我可以让我的应用程序成为多人游戏，并向所有人开放加入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'd love that. And we're we're building multiplayer right now as we speak. We spend the whole day to try to figure out like what it's really complex just because all apps can be can have very different type of multiplayer and that needs to be explained to users as well in a very intuitive way. But yeah, totally believe in first of all using apps together at least with your friends, your family, but also potentially building these more kind of community apps where everyone can join. Maybe I can make my app multiplayer and open for everyone to join.</p>
</details>

主持人: 一个很好的例子是，有人制作了一个关于狗的图像生成应用程序，你可以把你的任何一只狗变成不同时代的皇家肖像。所以对于所有狗主人来说，加入那个应用程序并能够发布到通用动态中会很酷。所以这是我们今天一直在讨论的事情，因为这会很酷，而不是你只是制作这些照片然后分享到某个地方，你只是把它们添加到正在进行的狗照片动态中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A good example of that is um made some image gen app around dogs uh where you can turn any of your dogs into like a royal um some user built it to like a royal portrait of different era. And so that would be cool for all the dog owners to just join that app and to be able to post to the universal feed. Um, and so that's something we've been talking about today because this would be really cool instead of if you just making these photos and then sharing somewhere, you're just adding them to the ongoing feed of dog photos.</p>

Eugenia: 但我觉得还有很多图像和视频提示词分享的例子，今天以非常低效的方式发生着。就像我一直在关注很多，你知道，青少年女孩和大学生女孩通常是新事物的早期采用者，她们一直在制作各种像“nano banana”和“Quen”这样的图像编辑提示词，比如她们躺在沙发上，背后是万圣节的鬼脸杀手。她们会在TikTok或Reels或其他地方发布图片，然后图片会爆火，然后她们会在TikTok评论中发布这种长篇提示词，这作为一种方式毫无意义，然后每个人都会问：“我去哪里做这个？我手机里有**Google**（谷歌）应用，为什么它不让我做这个？”你必须解释：“不，你需要**Gemini**（谷歌开发的AI模型）应用。”这感觉就像已经存在这种消费者需求和消费者行为，尤其是在创意内容方面的提示词分享，可以做得更好。我已经为此制作了一堆Wabby迷你应用程序，它可以做得更好，我认为创意社区会因此蓬勃发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I feel like there are so many examples too of um image and video prompt sharing that happens in very unoptimized ways today like I've been following a lot um as you know very well like teen girls and college age girls are often early adopters of stuff and they have been making all these like nano banana and Quen image edit prompts of like them like lying on a couch and the ghost face killers behind them for like Halloween and the and they'll like post the image on Tik Tok or reals or wherever and it will blow up and then they'll be like commenting like this long form prompt like in the comments on Tik Tok which makes no sense as a way to do it and then everyone's asking like where do I go to do this like I have the Google app why isn't let letting me do this and you have to explain like no you need the Gemini app and it just feels like there's already this consumer demand and consumer behavior around like prompt sharing in particular for creative stuff that could be done I've already made a bunch of Wabby mini apps for this and it it could be done so much better and I think that the creative community would really thrive with this.</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 哦，那是最重要的，我想这就是我们创立公司的原因。怎么可能我们拥有这种神一样的技术，却还在传递这些文本提示词，这几乎就像**Microsoft DOS**命令，但更糟糕，因为至少那些命令是可以学习的。它们很少，而且很短。而现在这些疯狂的非结构化文本段落，有时你还需要参考图片或其他东西。对我来说，这有点疯狂。我认为这可能是AI发现的最大问题之一。很难找到这些提示词。即使你看到了输出，你知道，你看到了这张带有鬼魂的很酷的照片。但我要如何重现它？我需要找到提示词。我需要知道是哪个应用程序。我需要知道选择哪个模型。通常这甚至不是很直观。到了那个时候，我已经完全失去了这样做的动力。相反，如果你能快速地点击TikTok评论中的链接，打开一个迷你应用程序，所有东西都已为你设置好。只需添加一张照片。你可以看到示例，你可以选择不同的风格等等。然后你可以在评论中看到其他人正在做什么。我认为这就是未来的方向。我认为最有趣的是，它结合了Vibe Coding应用程序，这是去年最大的趋势之一，以及使用AI。在此之前，它要么是你处于文本到提示到应用程序市场，要么处于其他市场，而这将其结合在一起，这真的是一个使用惊人提示词的地方，它模糊了这种差异。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, that was the most and I guess this is why we started the company. Um, how is it possible that we have this god-like technology yet we pass around these text prompts which is almost like Microsoft DOS commands but worse because at least the commands were was like sort of like you could learn them. They were a few whatever like they were short. They weren't that long and now these crazy unstructured paragraphs of text sometimes you also need a reference image or something else. To me that's a little bit crazy. Um, and I think that is kind of one of the biggest problems with discovery with AI. It's hard to find these prompts. Even if you saw the output of, you know, you saw this cool photo with the ghost, whatever. But then how do I recreate that? I need to find the prompt. I need to know what app. I need um I need to know what model to choose. Oftentimes it's not even very intuitive. And at that point, I've just lo lost all my motivation to do that. Instead of that, if you could just quickly, you know, click on the link in comments on Tik Tok and open a mini app where everything's already set up for you. Just add a photo. Um, and you can see examples, you can choose different styles and this and that. And then you can see in comments what what other people are doing. I think this is the way to go. And I think what's most interesting that it sort of combines the vibe coding apps, one of the biggest kind of trends of the last year at least, and also just using AI. before that it was all you know it's either the are you in the text to prompt to app market or are you in some other market and this kind of puts together like this is really the one place to use um amazing prompts or and it kind of blends this difference</p>
</details>

主持人: 您认为对于普通人来说，他们唯一的AI经验是使用ChatGPT，这种分享提示词的方式会让他们感到惊讶，需要调整，还是会觉得非常直观和显而易见，就像“哇，我一直在等这个”？

</details>

Eugenia: 我希望它会很容易，因为归根结底，它只是一个迷你应用程序。它只是**图形用户界面**（Graphical User Interface, GUI）应用程序。所以这是我们都习惯的东西。你不需要学习如何使用这些新工具。

<details>

</details>

主持人: 我认为使用命令行界面更难，因为你需要知道“我在这里复制粘贴文本吗？我在这里用这个提示词编辑图像还是稍后编辑？”它变得有点太松散了。没有指导方针。但每个人都知道如何使用应用程序。在某种程度上，很多这种“瘦包装器”的应用程序在某个时候爆火了，比如**Prisma**（一款照片编辑应用）或**Lensa**（一款AI照片编辑应用），它们就像“你知道，你把你的照片变成某种头像”。

<p class="english-text">I'd argue it's harder to use a command line because you need to know well do I copy paste the text here? Do I edit an image right here with this prompt or do I edit later?

Eugenia: 但很多，你知道，它们很棒，但同样，像这样的应用程序之所以能获得关注，而不是人们只是传递这个提示词，是有原因的，因为再次，它太高了。每当动机不是很高时，这种摩擦就会扼杀我所有的动力。我早上醒来，在**Twitter**（推特: 社交媒体平台）或**Reddit**（一个社交新闻聚合和讨论网站）上，我发现所有这些很酷的提示词，我想，“我得试试。”然后我想，“啊，复制粘贴。”它没有真正起作用或什么的。我忘记了。所以我想这就是我们至少非常兴奋的事情。这不仅仅是关于图像提示词，还有一些很酷的文本提示词。人们会想出各种各样很酷的东西。在像“**Chudupt Prompt Genius**”（Reddit上的一个子版块，专注于分享和讨论ChatGPT提示词）这样的子版块里有数百万人，我喜欢这些。有时你可以在里面找到一些疯狂的东西。

<p class="english-text">But a lot of, you know, they're awesome, but again, like there's a reason why apps uh like that gain traction and not, you know, people just passing along this this prompt cuz again, it's too high.

Uh I wake up in the morning, I'm on Twitter or Reddit, I find all these cool prompts, I'm like, I got to try it. And then I'm like, ah, copy paste. It didn't really work or whatever. I forgot about it. So that I think is something that at least we're super excited about. And it's not about just image on prompts, but also um some cool text prompts. Like people come up with all sorts of cool stuff. There's there are millions of people in the subreddits like Chudupt Prompt Genius, which I love those. Sometimes you can find some crazy stuff in it,</p>

Eugenia: 嗯，我不知道。我想我总是回到YouTube最初感觉多么神奇，以及所有这些平台，它们都真正关乎创造力和非常原始的，你知道，有时奇怪的东西，比如把家庭录像放到网上，就像TikTok一样。我仍然记得我所有的，你知道，年轻的朋友，更小的孩子，对不同的音乐对口型，那感觉多么奇怪，就像一个玩具，然后突然变得非常非常巨大。我想同样的事情也会发生在Wabby上，或者至少我们希望Wabby也会发生类似的趋势，最初可能很多东西看起来像玩具，或者非常简单，几乎有点滑稽，从某种意义上说，然后最终可以发展成一个更大的平台。但我想如果你想想，今天我们只是把应用程序当作软件，但如果我们可以把应用程序当作内容呢？如果我是一个健康影响者或健身影响者在TikTok上，也许我应该发布“这是我构建的五个迷你应用程序，它们展示了我的健身方案。”获取它们，也许有一种方式可以以某种方式将其货币化。也许这是一种让健身创作者创造更多有用内容的方式。现在人们出售课程之类的东西，而不是那样。我认为迷你应用程序会好得多，然后人们可以在社区的评论区讨论它。再次，这是一个社区的开始。人们一起锻炼，人们一起做一些事情。我确实认为我们将看到一种完全不同类型的软件。不仅仅是应用程序，不仅仅是陈旧固定的应用程序，而是更多内容、社区建设、社区启动器、对话启动器，以及一些有趣的小玩具。

<p class="english-text">Well, I don't know. I I guess I'm always going back to um how magical uh YouTube felt in the very beginning and all of these platforms where it was all really about just creativity and very raw um you know sometimes weird things like putting a home tape whatever home video on um online for Tik Tok. I still remember all my you know young whatever friends younger kids lip syncing to different music and how weird it was and felt like a toy and then all of a sudden became really really huge and I think the same will happen with um or at least we hope that the similar a similar trend will happen to Wabby where in the beginning maybe a lot of that will look like toys or something very simple very kind of funny almost and um in a sense and then eventually can grow into a much larger platform but I guess if you think about it like today we just treat apps as software but What if apps we could treat them as content? If I'm an health influencer or fitness influencer on Tik Tok, maybe I should put out here's my here are my five mini apps on why I build that are kind of showcasing my fitness protocol. Um, get them and maybe there's a way to monetize it in some way. Maybe it's a way for for that fitness creator to create more content that's now useful. Um, right now people sell courses and stuff instead of that. I think a mini app could be much better and then people can be talking about that in the community in the comment section. Again, this is a start of some community. People are working out together, people are doing something together. Um, I do think we'll see just a completely different type of software. Not just apps, not just stale fix apps, but more content, community build, uh, community starters, conversation starters, and and just fun little toys.</p>

Eugenia: 当然，百分之百。是的，当然。我确实相信，如果我们要真正将其视为YouTube，那么这应该是理想的情况，这是目前的最后一个前沿。创作者可以制作自己的专业内容，他们可以制作视频，他们可以制作节目，他们可以写作，但他们仍然无法创建软件。这仍然没有真正发生。但任何人，特别是小众创作者，都应该能够免费为他们的粉丝创建任何软件。这就是我真正期待的。我一直被这样一个想法所震撼，你知道，世界上最伟大的创作者**Mr. Beast**（Mr. Beast: 知名YouTube创作者）与他的粉丝有着如此紧密的联系。他们会为他做任何事，而他制作的东西是巧克力。这似乎是他选择的最佳变现方式，这感觉就像是创作者可以提供的另一种类型的服务，以与他们的粉丝建立更紧密的关系。

<p class="english-text">a hund, you know. Yes, of course. I do believe that that ideally this should happen if if we're really thinking about as YouTube, that's sort of the last frontier at this point. Creators can make their own professional content, they can make videos, they can make shows, they can write, but they still cannot create software. It's still really not happening. But any anyone and especially small niche creators should be able to afford to create for free any software for the their fans. And that's what I'm really really looking forward to. I I've been struck that by the idea that uh you know Mr. Beast the biggest creator in the world has such a close connection with his fans. They do anything for him and the thing that he makes is chocolate. like that's the thing the thing that he chooses to that seems like the best monetization and it just feels like this is yet another sort of uh you know type of uh offering that creators can provide to be you know have a closer relationship with their fans.</p>

主持人: 完全正确。如果你想想，甚至风格，我喜欢某些设计师，我想要他们构建的应用程序，因为我确信他们会构建非常漂亮的应用程序，我想看看它们，即使功能相同，**番茄钟**（Pomodoro timer）也一样，但我想要他们对它的看法。等等。我认为有这么多不同的群体和利基市场，而且不应该只关乎货币化。它真正关乎不同的风格，不同的生活观，世界观。

<p class="english-text">Exactly. And if you think about it, just even the style, like I would love like certain designers, I want their apps that they build cuz I'm sure they're going to build very beautiful apps and I want to look at them and you even if it's the same functionality, the same whatever Pomodoro timer, but I want their take on it. Um, and so on. I think this there's so many different groups and niches that and it it shouldn't all just be about monetizing. It's really just about different styles, different um outlook on life, on the world.</p>

Eugenia: 对我来说，这非常非常有趣。我是**Reddit**（一个社交新闻聚合和讨论网站）的忠实用户，我觉得它非常令人兴奋，因为人们只是围绕某些兴趣聚集在一起。这在其他平台上并没有那么多发生。所以这也是我在这里感到兴奋的事情。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Um and that is to me is very very interesting. I'm a huge user of Reddit and I find it very exciting because people just join around certain interests. Um and that doesn't happen happen on other platforms really that much. Um so that's something that I'm excited about here as well.</p>
</details>

主持人: 是的，我认为从创作者的角度来看，内容创作的奇怪之处在于，我们都以各种方式成为内容创作者并发布内容，我认为其中一个奇怪之处在于，你通常不知道，你知道，你看到它获得了多少曝光，但你不知道这些是否是机器人。你不知道有多少人真正使用了你发布的提示词，或者观看了完整的视频，或者其他什么。我认为这甚至超越了货币化，Wabby的这部分功能，你可以看到别人用你写的提示词或你制作的应用程序或你开发的东西做了什么，创造了什么，完成了什么，这会非常酷。不仅对于现有创作者来说，他们显然想这样做，而且对于今天不是创作者，但有非常有趣的想法，但却没有办法构建自己的移动应用程序，在应用商店中获得批准，发布，分发，所有这些事情的人来说，也会非常酷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I think from the creator perspective, one of the weird things about put and we're all kind of content creators in various ways and put out content and one of the weird things about that I think is you often you don't really know like you see how many impressions it gets but you don't know if those are bots. You don't know how many people are actually like using the prompt you posted or watching the full video or whatever. And I think that is going to be like even beyond monetization, that part of WABI where like you can see what someone else has done or created or accomplished or whatever with the prompt you wrote or the app you made or the thing that you developed um will be incredibly cool. Not only for existing creators for whom it's really obvious they want to do this, but also for people who are not creators today, but who have really interesting ideas and just like no way to build their own mobile app, get it approved in the app store, ship it, like distribute it, that that whole type of thing.</p>
</details>

主持人: 是的，还有哪些新类别的创作者可能会出现？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, like what other new class of creators could be?</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 是的，这就是为什么在我们的风格中，在我们的某些交流中，我们也试图……我想我们对互联网的早期，以及保持怪异和奇怪有点怀旧。现在，很多视频平台都非常精致和商业化。你甚至看不到你的朋友了。你也很少看到那么多奇怪的内容。你只看到非常精心策划、精致的东西。但随着迷你应用程序，随着软件，我想我们只是进入了一个新时代，充满了大量真正奇怪和迷人的新迷你应用程序，它们甚至永远不可能存在，因为它们在应用商店中不足以成为一门生意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, that's why in our style like in in in some of our communications, we're also trying to um I guess we're a little bit nostalgic about that early those early days of the internet and just being weird and staying weird. Right now, a lot of the video platforms are very polished and very commercial. Um you don't even see your friends anymore. You don't see that much weird content. You just see very curated, polished um stuff. But with mini apps, with software, I guess we're just entering this new era of just tons of really weird and fascinating um new mini apps that wouldn't even could never exist uh because they wouldn't be enough of a business on the app store.</p>
</details>

主持人: 对。对。好吧，说到早期，我们应该谈谈Replica以及您在社区中的历史吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. Right. Well, speaking of the early days, should we talk a bit about Replica and kind of your history in the community?</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 是的。是的。也许……所以您在这个领域是真正的先驱，在其他人开始之前就已经涉足了。您提到了2012年。也许您可以谈谈您对这个类别如何演变的反思，以及您是如何帮助创建它的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. Maybe um we'll just so you were a true pioneer in the space before before everyone else was doing it. You know, you mentioned 2012. Um maybe just talk about your reflections of how that category has has you helped create it and then how it's evolved.</p>
</details>

### AI发展的历史：从Replica到OpenAI

Eugenia: 嗯，它确实进化了。我注意到了，这太不可思议了。这很疯狂，因为我们最近一直在思考这个问题，与Replica的一位早期员工交谈时，我们坚信它会发生，但当它真正发生时，我们仍然感到非常惊讶。我想这只是，它仍然感觉像完全的魔法。对我来说，我之所以涉足这个领域，是因为我的朋友在2012年于**Google DeepMind**（谷歌旗下的人工智能公司）工作，他来告诉我关于**Word2vec**（Word to Vector: 一种将词语转换为向量的技术），以及第一项将词语转换为向量并能够真正处理词语的技术。在此之前，语言就像一个完全独立的东西，计算机无法与之交互，但现在突然可以了。对我来说，我从小读**Wittgenstein**（维特根斯坦: 奥地利哲学家）的书。所以对我来说，这就像，“嗯，语言的限制就是我世界的限制。”所以我感觉，“哦，这太疯狂了。如果计算机学习语言，那么它们就会了解世界，它们将真正变得智能，这就是**人工智能**（artificial intelligence）的未来。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um it definitely evolved. I've noticed it's pretty crazy. Well, it's wild because I we were thinking about it uh recently just talking to um one of the early employees of Replica that we had a very strong belief that it would happen, but we still were so surprised when it actually happened. I guess this was just it just still felt like complete magic. Um for me I got into it because I uh my friend worked at um Google DeepMind in 2012 and so he came to me to tell me about wordtovec and kind of the first technology to translate words into vectors and to be able to actually do something with words. Before that language was just this whole separate almost like thing that computers could not interact with but now all of a sudden they could. Um and to me I grew up reading Wiggenstein. So for me it was like well the limits of the uh language are the limits of my world. So I felt like oh well that's insane. If the computers learn language then they'll learn about the world that will be they'll be truly smart that is the future of artificial intelligence.</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 所以那时**ImageNet**（ImageNet: 一个大型视觉数据库）也刚刚问世。所以我们看到了所有这些关于图像识别的新模型，我们觉得，“嗯，我们必须创办一家专注于语言模型、专注于对话生成的公司。”但当然，当时根本没有相关的论文，也没有已知的算法或任何构建的模型。那时真的什么都没有。所以我们只是专注于构建一些技术，使用任何东西来构建聊天机器人，试图围绕它构建一些语言模型。然后当然，2015年，**Google**（谷歌）发布了第一篇论文，由**Quoc**撰写，展示了第一个应用于对话生成的**深度学习**（deep learning）模型。他们当时没有发布任何模型。所以这一切都只是阅读论文，查看一些显然经过精心挑选的结果，并尝试复制。当我们在2015年8月看到这一点时，我们基本上把公司所有的一切都押在了构建这些模型上。我们说：“好吧，就是这样了。它就在眼前。我们需要真正专注于构建这些语言模型，推出第一个**生成式AI**（generative AI）产品，即聊天机器人。”我们用Replica做到了，但它并没有近在眼前。它还需要大约七年。然后我们不得不坚持足够长的时间，才能真正接触到第一个**Transformer模型**（Transformer model）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so that's also imageet just came out. So we saw all these new models around image recognition and we felt like well we got to start a company focused on language models focused on dialect generation. Uh but of course there were no papers around it at all and no no known algorithms or anything built models um really back then there was nothing. So we're just focused on building some technology to build chat bots using whatever the trying to build some language models around that. And then of course 2015 the first paper came out of Google by Quad that would actually showed off the first deep learning um model applied to dialect generation and they didn't publish any models back then. So it was all about just kind of reading the paper and seeing some of the obviously cherrypicked results and trying to replicate that. And when we saw that in August 2015, we just basically put all of our um bet everything we had at the company on building those models. We said, "Okay, well, this is it. This is right around the corner. We need to really focus on building these language models, getting the first generative AI product out chatbot out there, which we did with Replica, but it wasn't around the corner. It was like seven years away."</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 然后我们不得不坚持足够长的时间，才能真正接触到第一个Transformer模型。然后当然，我想下一个神奇的时刻是谷歌的**Mina**（米娜: 谷歌的一篇关于对话模型的论文）论文，它也提出了第一个Transformer模型。然后我记得在2020年，**OpenAI**（人工智能研究公司）邀请我们去参观GPT-3，在API发布之前，与他们合作，成为GPT-3 API的首批合作伙伴之一。所以我们去了办公室，**Meera**（米拉: OpenAI前合作伙伴负责人），当时她实际上是负责合作伙伴关系的。**Sam Altman**（萨姆·奥尔特曼: OpenAI首席执行官）向我们展示了GPT-3，我记得当时我简直惊呆了。这太疯狂了，在此之前，如果你想想，我们必须训练每一个模型。我们必须创建特定的数据集。如果你想训练一个对话模型，你必须拥有大量的聊天数据，然后你会训练模型，模型只能进行对话。但有了**GPT-3**（Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3: 一种大型语言模型），它是第一个**零样本学习**（zero-shot learning）和**少样本学习**（few-shot learning）模型，它可以做任何事情。它不只是必须以对话格式回应。你可以告诉它，“写一条像Sam Altman那样的推文”，或者“写一条这样的推文”，或者“翻译”，它就会这样做。所以这感觉绝对神奇，我们是OpenAI GPT-3 API的首批合作伙伴之一。当时仍然很疯狂，因为我们仍然有一个**Slack**（Slack: 一款团队协作工具）频道，**Greg Brockman**（格雷格·布罗克曼: OpenAI联合创始人）正在为我们训练一个模型，现在回想起来感觉真是奇妙的逆转。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then we just had to survive for long enough to actually get to the first transformer models. Um and then of course I think the next magical moment was the um Mina paper also out of Google with the first transformer model. And then I remember in 2020 we got invited by OpenAI to go see um GP3 before you know API to to partner up with them to be one of the first partners uh for GP3 API to launch. So we came to the office and Meera who back then was actually leading partnerships. Um and Sam showed us GP3 and I remember that was just I was floored. It was insane just to before that if you think about it we had to train every model. We had to create the specific data set. If you wanted to train a dialogue model you have to have tons of chat data and you would train the model and the model could only do dialogue. But with GT3, it was the first kind of zeroot few shot model where it could do anything. It didn't just have to um respond in a dialog format. You can tell it well write a tweet like Sam Alman or write a tweet this or translate and it would do that. And so that felt absolutely magical and we were the first uh one of the first partners of OpenAI GPT3 API. Um they it was still crazy because we still have a Slack channel where Greg Brockman is training a model for us which now feels just such a amazing weird reversal.</p>
</details>

主持人: 您仍然拥有那个模型。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You still have the model.</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 嗯，它只是一个为Replica**微调**（fine-tuned）的**DaVinci**（达芬奇模型: OpenAI早期的一种基础模型）。但我们是API调用量最大的客户，因为我们是市场上唯一使用生成式AI的聊天机器人，现在想起来很奇怪，但当时所有大公司都害怕推出生成式AI产品，因为**Microsoft Tay**（微软Tay: 微软推出的AI聊天机器人）事件发生了，它在一个小时内就变成了一个纳粹聊天机器人。所以其他所有人都太害怕推出它们了。所以我们是唯一一家持续了很长时间的公司，直到OpenAI推出了他们的芯片并改变了历史。当然，这很疯狂，因为在此之前，我们几乎拥有所有关键词，比如AI聊天机器人、人工智能，在每一个平台上。然后我们还拥有数百个AI域名，我只是让它们过期了，因为我觉得没有人想要它们。它们甚至不在任何大型域名平台上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um it it was it just I think it was a fine-tuned da Vinci for um replica but we were the biggest customer in terms of API calls because we we were the only chatbot available in the market that actually used generative AI and now it's weird to think about it but uh back then all the big companies were scared to put out generative AI uh products because there were Microsoft tie happened and it turned into some Nazi chatbot in literally an hour an hour and so everyone else was too scared to put them out there. So we were sort of the only ones for so so long until open eye had um you know put out their chip and kind of change change history with that of course. Uh but it was crazy because for before that we literally owned all the keywords like AI chatbot artificial intelligence on every single platform and um and then we also owned like hundreds of AI domains which I just let expire because I felt like no one wants them. They're not even on any of the big domain platforms.</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 然后最近我去看了一下，还有哪些.ai域名仍然可用，它们只是普通的词语，而唯一可用的词语是像“vomit.ai”和“Iraq.ai”。我当时想，天哪，这太令人沮丧了。因此，给Wabby命名非常困难。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And then recently I went to see what.ai uh domains still are still available that are just regular words and the only words that are available like vomit.ai and Iraq.ai. I was telling my god this is so upsetting. Um naming Wabby because of that was pretty hard.</p>

主持人: 是的，这就是我……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So that's kind of the evolution from my</p>
</details>

主持人: 您在晚餐时给我们讲了一个关于您在OpenAI办公室度过的时光的故事。也许可以谈谈当你们在那里工作时，那是什么样子，那种能量是什么，团队的期望是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You told us a story at dinner about the time that you'd spent in the OpenAI office. Maybe talk a little bit about that when you guys were working out of there. What it was like, what the energy was like, what were the expectations of the team?</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 我想，是的。所以当OpenAI成立时，它有点像从**Y Combinator**（YC: 知名创业孵化器）出来的，它是YC Research。所以他们当时正在做几个不同的研究小组。一个关于**UBI**（Universal Basic Income: 无条件基本收入），一个关于AI，还有一些其他的。因为我们是YC公司，他们让我们来，他们非常慷慨地给予我们时间，他们会让我们去当时的**Greg Brockman**（格雷格·布罗克曼: OpenAI联合创始人）的公寓，那里是他们的总部，他们会让我们和其他几家在YC做AI的公司一起来，提问，向他们学习，只是交谈，也许交流我们正在构建的经验。所以我们会去那个公寓，问所有的问题。通常是**Ilia Sutskever**（伊利亚·苏茨克维尔: OpenAI联合创始人）和**Andre Karpathy**（安德烈·卡帕西: 知名AI研究员）以及其他一些人，那绝对令人难以置信。我们当然完全被震撼了，非常高兴能在那儿。只是非常感激有这个机会。然后他们搬到了他们的办公室，我们也会去那里。很快他们就停止了语言模型的研究。我们非常沮丧，因为我们真的想继续去那里，但他们不想谈论任何语言模型，因为没有人真正研究它们。这可能让我们感到非常奇怪，因为我们非常坚定地继续相信语言模型，但他们完全转向了玩视频游戏和所有这些代理，重建世界和这些世界中的代理，以及**强化学习**（reinforcement learning）等等所有这些其他有趣的事情。我想当时唯一一个继续研究语言模型的人是**Alec Radford**（亚历克·拉德福德: OpenAI研究员）。所以我们有机会向他提问，但是的，当然，这很疯狂，因为当我们去OpenAI的时候，他们当然已经是超级明星了，但仍然感觉像一个很小的研究小组，正在尝试做一些有趣的事情。当然，现在看到它成为世界上最大的公司之一，绝对是疯狂的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that Yeah. So when um when openi started was kind of out of YC um it was YC research. So they were doing a few I guess you remember they were doing a few different research groups. one on uh UBI, one on AI, some other ones. And so because we were YC company and um they let us come, they were very uh uh generous with their time and they would let us come to back then Greg's apartment where they were uh headquartered I would say and they would let us come with a couple other companies uh that were doing AI at YC to um ask questions, learn from them and just talk maybe exchange experience on what we're building. So we would come to that apartment and ask all the questions. Um usually it was um Ilia and Andre and some other people and that was absolutely incredible. We were of course absolutely starruck um and super happy to be there. just so, you know, grateful for the opportunity. And then they moved to the um to their office and we would go there as well. And um very quickly they stopped working on language models. And we were very upset because we really wanted to continue going there, but they didn't want to talk about any language models because no one was really working on them. Um, and that may have made us feel very um, strange because we were so set on continuing and believing in language models, but they completely moved away to shifted to playing video games and all of these kind of agents kind of rebuilding the worlds and agents in those worlds reinforcement learning for that and all and and all these other interesting things. Um and I guess the only person for um if in the beginning it was kind of Alec Ratford for continued to work on language models. So we had an opportunity to ask him some questions but yeah of course that was it's just wild to think to think that because when we were going to open of course they were uh superstars even back then but still it felt like such a small uh kind of research group um that is trying to do something interesting. Of course, now to see it become one of the biggest companies in the world is absolutely wild.</p>
</details>

主持人: 嗯，这很有趣，因为Andre在最近的播客中说，整个视频游戏方向是一个错误的方向。这是一个错误的研究方向，他们可能应该坚持语言模型。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it's interesting because Andre said on the recent pod that the entire video games direction was an incorrect direction. It was incorrect research direction and they probably should have stuck with language.</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you guys were right.</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 嗯，正确并不总是……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um it's a well being right is not always</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 你必须正确，也要执行。我想在某种程度上，我们确实在Replica上投入了大量精力来构建语言模型，但在某个时候，我们需要更多的资金来做这件事，在为此工作了这么长时间之后，在那个时候，我们真的开始专注于收入最大化，因为我们有点害怕，我们想，“嗯……”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you got to be right but also execute. I think to a degree we we were really invested with replica in building language models but at some point we just required a lot more capital to do that and after being after working on that for so long at that point we just got really into just revenue maxim maximisation at some point because we a little bit got maybe scared we're like well</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 我们没有勇气说，“好吧，我们需要2000万美元，我们将构建那个模型”，尽管那是在Mina论文之后我们内部的讨论。我们只是需要更多的钱。如果你想想Replica，我们只筹集了100万美元，我想它仍然都在银行里，你知道，我们运营了很多年，建立了一个大企业。但当然，事后看来，这是一个非常有趣的教训，有时非常灵活，非常节俭，非常注重利润是很好的，但你可能会错过一个几乎是世代相传的机会。我并不是说我们，你知道，即使我们押注了它，也许我们也不会构建它。我永远不会将自己与真正做到了的天才相提并论。我们可能无论如何都不是合适的人选，但我想这个教训仍然成立。有时你需要放手一搏，孤注一掷。

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we didn't have the balls to say okay well we need 20 million and we'll build that model even though that was our discussion internally right after Mina uh paper and so on. We just need to get a lot more money. If you think about it with um Replica, we only raised $1 million and I guess it's still all in the bank and you know we we went for many many years and um built a big business. But of course, this is in hindsight a very interesting lesson that sometimes being very nimble and very kind of scrappy and very profit oriented is great, but you can miss out on almost like a generational chance. And I's not saying we, you know, even if we bet on it, maybe we would have not built it. Um, I would never compare myself to the geniuses that actually did it. we probably were not the right people anyway, but still the the lesson I think still stands. Sometimes you need to sort of go big or go home</p>

### 预测消费者行为与同理心

主持人: 我们在消费者团队中常说，消费者行为，尤其是新行为，无法预测，只能观察。我认为您实际上是少数几个不适用此规则的人，因为您似乎能够预测消费者行为。您在很多事情上都如此超前，我想每次我们和您交谈，您似乎不仅关注当下发生的事情，还关注下一件应该发生的事情。您是如何培养这种洞察力的？我想很多人都会好奇。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the things we say on the consumer team is consumer behavior, especially new behavior, cannot be predicted. It can only be observed. I think you are actually one of the few people that is not true for because you seem to be able to predict consumer behavior. Like you've been so early to a number of these things and I think just every time we talk to you, you seem to have an eye on not only like what's going on today, but like what the next thing should be. Is that like how did you develop that sense? I guess I'm sure a lot of people would be curious to know.</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 我不知道我是否有那种洞察力。我只有几个想法，但我非常深入地相信它们，然后我就会深入研究。我开始思考它，但我确实认为我有很多……我确实有新闻学背景，我几乎整个童年都梦想成为一名记者。我的第一份工作是12岁时在报社工作。我曾是一名调查记者，我喜欢它的一点是能够去和人们交谈，真正努力了解他们，体验他们的生活。为此，你必须有很强的同理心和对人们的好奇心。我认为今天我看到AI，特别是它是由一种非常特定类型的人格构建的。通常是这些天才、这些杰出的天才、物理学家、数学家，他们在构建算法、数学和科学突破方面非常出色，但他们通常缺乏人类同理心。事情就是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know if I have that sense. I only have like a couple ideas, but I really believe in them deeply and then I go really deep down the rabbit hole. I start thinking about it and um but I do think that I do have a lot of um I do have a background in journalism and I pretty much the whole I grew up dreaming of being a journalist. I my first job was 12 years old working at newspaper. Um I was an investigative journal reporter for a while and the one thing I loved about is being able to go and talk to people and to really really try to get to know them and live their lives. Um and so for that you sort of have to have a lot of empathy and just trying to really and curiosity about people. And I think today what I'm seeing with AI especially it's being built by a very specific type of person uh personality. It's often times these savants, these like brilliant geniuses, um, physicists, mathematicians, and they're insane in building algorithms and math and kind of, uh, scientific breakthroughs, but they usually lack on the human empathy side. That's just kind of how it is.</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 同时，我恰恰相反。在科学方面，我是一个笨蛋。我来自一个物理学家家庭，他们总是说：“天哪，你为什么不能聪明点也去学物理呢？”但我不能。但同时，我只是对人类状况，人们正在做的事情非常感兴趣。看到我妈妈试图理解如何从Reddit复制粘贴一个提示词。这对她来说是一个非常陌生的想法。我意识到我妈妈非常精通电脑。她总是拿着手机，总是用笔记本电脑。但不知何故，她无法破解那个。这太不用户友好了。理解这些概念，我想，正是让我们看到并提出Wabby这个想法的原因。Replica也是如此，只是四处旅行，与人们交谈，看到有多少孤独，有多少人只是想能够告诉某人他们正在经历什么，以及有多少人能够倾听。我认为这种认识，也许AI今天不能很好地说话，但它能倾听。这可能对世界上数百万人来说是开创性的事情。所以我想这就是让我能够以稍微不同的角度看待同一个问题的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Meanwhile, I'm the opposite. I'm a uh, dumb dumb when it comes to science. Coming from a family of physicists, they were always like, "Oh my god, like why can't you be smart and also go study physics?" But I couldn't. But at the same time, I'm just really interested in human condition, what people are doing. And just seeing my mom trying to understand how to copy paste a prompt from Reddit. It was such a foreign idea for her to her. And I realized like my mom is very savvy with computers. She's always on her phone. She's always on her laptop. But somehow she can't crack that. this is just too this is just not user friendly enough and kind of understanding those concepts and um I think was really what let us see kind of come up with the idea for Wabby and the same goes for replica just traveling around um uh and talking to people and seeing how much loneliness there is and how much people just want to be able to tell someone what they're going through and how few people are able to listen and I think that realization that maybe an AI is not can't talk well today, but it could listen. Uh that that could be a groundbreaking thing for millions in the world. Um so I think this is kind of what just allows me to have a slightly different angle at the same problem.</p>

### 硬件的未来：AI优先的操作系统

主持人: 如果您想推测一下硬件的未来，比如，那是什么样的硬件？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you wanted to speculate on the future of like hardware um like what is sort of the that hardware just like like you know 5 10 years what is going to be the interaction like how are we going to be interacting with these applications?</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 我确实对硬件有一些想法，我根本不是一个硬件专家，但我像我们所有人一样是一个硬件用户。所以，我有权发表意见。我认为在这一领域，开发者中存在一个巨大的思维误区，他们总觉得语音是主要的交互界面。这就像是最好的终极界面。我认为那是因为他们一直在错误地思考电影《**Her**》（《她》）中的情节，并且错过了电影《Her》的重点，那就是是的，语音在那部电影中很棒，因为那是**Samantha Johansson**（斯嘉丽·约翰逊: 电影《Her》中AI角色的配音演员）不断在他耳边重重呼吸，那完全奏效了。你甚至不需要看到任何人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, I do have a few ideas around hardware and I'm not a hardware person at all, but I'm a hardware user like all of us. So, I get to have opinions. I think I think where there's a huge mind trap that exists among uh builders in the space where they somehow think that voice is the main interface. It's like the best ultimate interface. And I think that's because they are somehow thinking about the movie her all the time but not in the right way and kind of missing the whole point of the movie her that um yes voice was amazing in that movie because it was Samantha Johansson constantly heavy breathing his ear and that totally worked. You didn't even need to see anyone. Um</p>
</details>

Eugenia: 在我的例子中，这就是它奏效的原因。但如果你真的思考语音界面，它们是如此不完美。如果你和正在睡觉的人躺在床上，你就不能使用那个设备。你在拥挤的空间里不能使用它。你在办公室里不能使用它。甚至在走路时也不能使用它。这有点奇怪。所以突然之间，你把所有赌注都押在了上面。有很多人试图构建纯语音设备。在我看来，这完全是错误的。它当然可以是与计算机交互的一种奇妙的额外方式，但现在每一台**Alexa**（亚马逊的智能语音助手）中，大约75%都配备了屏幕。因为即使我在做饭时设置计时器，这个众所周知的语音用例，我仍然需要看到计时器。我不会每秒都问“嘿，还剩下多少时间？”这很奇怪。所以我想这可能是我看来最大的错误，就是试图推出这些无屏幕设备。我喜欢屏幕。我认为语音无法解决发现和主动性问题。

<p class="english-text">in my case that's why that worked. But if you really think about voice interfaces they're just so imperfect. Um, you can't use that device if you're laying in a bed with someone who's sleeping. You can't use it in a crowded space. You can't use it at a at the office. You can't use it even walking around. It's a little bit weird. And and so all of a sudden, you're betting everything. There's a lot of people trying to build voice only devices. In my case, completely wrong. like it can be a fantastic extra way to interact with uh the computer, but every single Alexa right now is like 75% of them are being shipped with a screen. Uh because even if I'm setting a timer when I'm cooking, the proverbial um voice use case even dancer I need to see the timer. I'm not going to be asking, hey, how much how long is this left every every second? Uh this is just strange. And so I think this is kind of the the biggest mistake mistake in my in my view is trying to ship these screenless devices. Uh I love screens. I think there's no way with voice to solve for discovery for proactivity.</p>

Eugenia: 我会讨厌，你知道，语音和iPhone最糟糕的事情就是读出推送通知、短信。我当时想，天哪，请关掉。这太可怕了。也很难关掉它。

<p class="english-text">I would hate if you know the worst thing with um voice and the iPhone is is reading out push not notifications text messages that are come. I'm like God please shut off. It's horrible. It's very hard also to turn it off.</p>

主持人: 这太糟糕了。如果你只是想要效率，但你不想它在耳边大声读出来，因为这是一种非常缓慢的获取信息的方式。

<p class="english-text">That's terrible. if this was just being you want productivity but you don't want it to be read out loud in your ear because this is just this very uh slow way of getting information in your brain. Um so anyway so I think this is kind of the biggest mistake.</p>

Eugenia: 所以，总之，我认为这是最大的错误。我永远不会制造一个无屏幕设备。事实上，我会把它做成一个非常以屏幕为先的设备，但我确实相信AI设备不是一个语音驱动的东西。它更多的是关于构建这个**AI优先的操作系统**（AI-first operating system）。同时让所有模型都在本地运行。我认为这其中有很多东西，比如真正构建一个AI优先的智能手机，你知道，不是今天这种更多由CPU驱动的硬件，而是未来的硬件，其中模型可以在本地运行，操作系统与今天完全不同，没有固定应用程序，能够随时为你更改和创建软件，其个性化程度比今天更深。是的，我认为现在肯定有这种设备的市场空间。你知道，AI现在只是你手机上的一个应用程序。它不应该仅仅如此。

<p class="english-text">I would not ever make a screenless device. In fact I would make it very much uh screen first device but I do believe that the AI device is not about a voiced driven thing. It's more about um building this uh AI first operating system. Um having all the models run locally as well. I think that there's a lot in that like building truly an AI first smartphone and you know not today kind of more CPUdriven whatever um hardware but more the hardware of the future where there are models that can run locally with the operating system is super different from what it is today with no fixed apps with being able to change and create software on the go for you with a with a level of personalization that goes a lot deeper than what it is today. Um, yeah, I think that there is definitely space for a device like that right now. You know, AI is just an app on your phone. Uh, it should not be that way. Um, I guess</p>
