summary: 初创公司的招聘数量正在急剧下降，这仅仅是资本寒冬的延续，还是AI已开始取代工作岗位？Carta洞察负责人Peter Walker通过独家数据揭示了风险投资领域的深刻变革。尽管投资总额保持稳定，但获得融资的公司数量减半。AI正催生规模更小、效率更高的团队，彻底改变了衡量初创公司成功的标准，例如“每名员工的年经常性收入”（ARR
  per FTE）已成为新的黄金标准。本文深入探讨了这些趋势对软件工程师、求职者和创始人的具体影响。

title: Carta数据洞察：风险投资、人工智能与初创公司的现状
---
### 导语：VC 寒冬与 AI 崛起

初创公司的招聘人数远比过去要少。2022 年 1 月，在 Carta 平台上的公司共招聘了 73,000 人。到了 2023 年 1 月，这个数字降至 40,000 人。2024 年 1 月，进一步降至 32,000 人。我预计到 2025 年 1 月，这个数字大概会在 20,000 人左右。我并不认为 AI 不会取代工作岗位，事实上，我认为它已经在这么做了。

<p class="english-text">Startups are hiring far fewer people than they used to. In January of 2022, companies on Carta hired 73,000 people. In January 2023, they hired 40,000. In January 2024, they hired 32,000. And in January 2025, I think it's going to be like 20,000 or so. I am not one of those people that says AI is not going to take jobs. I think it kind of already is.</p>

风险资本的变化如何影响初创公司和成长期公司？这对软件工程师又意味着什么？Peter Walker 是 Carta 的洞察主管，而全美超过 50% 的初创公司都在使用 Carta 来记录融资和股权相关数据。Peter 收集了十几组关于科技初创公司变化趋势的有趣数据点和图表。

今天，我们讨论了获得融资的初创公司数量为何在持续下降，尽管风险投资的总额保持不变。数据揭示了 AI 的影响，它可能导致团队规模更小，并出现更多单人创始人。我们还探讨了在加入一家由风投支持的公司之前应该注意什么，以及什么能帮助你在初创公司中茁壮成长。

<p class="english-text">Today we talk about how the number of startups getting funding has been steadily dropping even though the amount of VC invested has remained constant. Data showing the impact of AI and how it might result in smaller teams and more solo founders. what to look for before joining a VC funded company and what can help you thrive at a startup.</p>
</details>

### 风险投资生态系统入门

让我们从**风险投资**（Venture Capital, VC: 指投资于新兴、迅速发展、具有巨大升值潜力的初创企业的资本）生态系统开始。在美国，风险投资是**私募股权**（Private Equity: 投资于非上市公司的股权）的一个子集。人们所熟知的标准模式是：一群出色的投资者四处寻找璞玉，即那些需要资本的年轻公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now let's start with the venture capital ecosystem, how healthy it is and and how can we think of of health. In the US that is a venture is a subset of private equity. It's the standard things that people are familiar with of all these wonderful investors going around finding diamonds in the rough young companies that need capital.</p>
</details>

理想情况下，这些公司的估值会飙升，成为我们今天所喜爱的大型上市公司。我认为，所谓的 **MAG 7**（Magnificent Seven: 指的是七家美国最大的科技公司，通常包括苹果、微软、Alphabet、亚马逊、Nvidia、Meta和特斯拉）中的每一家，在某个阶段都曾接受过风险投资。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hopefully those companies then shoot up in valuation and they become the public companies that we love today. So you know all of I think all of the MAG 7 at one point or another took venture capital. The Mac 7 is a seven guess tech companies right? Is it Microsoft, Apple, Google, Nvidia? I think Mango is the new one where you talk that includes Nvidia as it the the acronym always keeps changing.</p>
</details>

是的，这个缩写一直在变，以前是 **FANG**（Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google: 早期对四大科技巨头的简称），尽管现在 Facebook 变成了 Meta。但这些大型科技公司正是风险投资目标的绝佳范例。风投试图找到非常年轻的公司，给它们注入一笔资金，然后观察它们的估值随着时间的推移急剧增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. It used to be fang even though it's now meta not Facebook but yeah. Exactly. Yeah, they're they're screwing with the names a little bit, so we got to keep changing the acronym. But those big uh seven tech companies are good examples of what venture capital is trying to do. They're trying to find really really young companies, give them a slug of capital, and then watch their valuations expand dramatically over time.</p>
</details>

曾有一段时间，风险投资似乎成了创办公司的“默认”方式。但这从未是事实。不接受风投的公司总是比接受风投的公司多得多。只是谈论那些接受风投的公司更容易，因为当你融资时，会有一系列里程碑式的节点，比如**种子轮**（Seed Round: 通常是初创公司获得的第一次重要融资）、**A 轮**（Series A: 公司产品已获得市场验证后，为扩大市场份额进行的融资）和 **B 轮**（Series B: 公司业务已进入快速发展阶段，为进一步扩张进行的融资）。而如果你不接受任何风投，外界就很难了解你的业务进展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So VC, for a while, it kind of felt like venture capital was the quote unquote default way to build a startup. That's never actually been true. There's always been many, many more companies that don't take VC versus the ones that do. It's just a lot easier to talk about the ones that do take VC because as you raise money, there are sort of checkpoints along the way. So, you get seed rounds and series A rounds and series B rounds. Whereas, if you don't take any VC, nobody really knows where you are as a business. And so, it's a lot easier to talk about the venturebacked businesses than it is about the non-venturebacked ones.</p>
</details>

### VC 支持与非 VC 支持公司的核心区别

对于一名软件工程师或普通员工来说，加入一家接受风投的公司和一家没有接受风投的公司，在文化、节奏、薪酬等方面会有什么不同？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And as someone who has been embedded in in the VC world, what do you think the main differences are? just thinking about as a software engineer or as an employee thinking about joining a VC funded company versus a nonVC funded one what might be something I know it's hard to generalize but but still let's let's try right like what what might be differences in terms of culture pace compensation those kind of things.</p>
</details>

我认为这可以归结为一个关键区别：风险投资的业务本质是为增长提供资金，而且不是普通增长，是爆发式增长。因此，任何接受风投的企业，根据其定义，都会被投资者推动去追求超高速增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'd say it actually boils down to one key difference which is venture is in the business of funding growth and not just regular growth but expansive growth so any sort of VC backed business will by definition be pushed by their investors and should have the outlook that we are going to grow super fast.</p>
</details>

例如，最近的 AI 公司，像 Cursor 和其他一些公司，它们的 **ARR**（Annual Recurring Revenue: 年度经常性收入，是衡量订阅制业务健康度的关键指标）指标增长速度超过了我们见过的几乎所有公司，它们就是风险投资的完美候选者。相反，如果你的业务每年增长 20%，并且盈利，这是一家很棒的公司，但它不适合风险投资，因为它无法达到投资者认为值得下注的增长率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So for instance, the recent examples of the AI companies like cursor and others who are just ballooning up through different ARR metrics faster than basically any companies we've ever seen, those are perfect candidates for venture capital. If instead you have a business that's growing 20% a year, they're making money, it's a great business, but that isn't a candidate for VC because it doesn't project to have the growth rates necessary to make these bets worthwhile for the investors.</p>
</details>

这种差异显然会对薪酬、公司关注点、实际工作节奏以及来自董事会和创始人的期望产生下游影响。当你受制于投资者的期望时，与你仅仅为自己和客户构建产品相比，会发生很多变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that obviously has downstream impacts to compensation that has downstream impacts to what the company is focused on. You know, the pace of the actual work, the expectations both from the board and from the founders. There's a lot of changes that happen when you're beholden to investor expectations versus you are just building for yourselves and for your customers.</p>
</details>

### 增长的代价：非理性与权衡

我曾在 Uber 最疯狂的增长时期工作，那里的一切都令人兴奋又充满压力，有时甚至有点非理性。我记得有一次我们在印度发生了服务中断，支付系统宕机了。事后复盘损失时，一位工程师说：“实际上，我们为公司省了一大笔钱。” 因为在印度，我们每完成一单平均亏损 2 美元，所以错过了 5 万个订单，就相当于节省了 10 万美元。这种事在其他类型的公司是绝不可能发生的。这一切都回归到增长，而增长有时意味着非理性的行为。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I worked at Uber at its craziest growth time and I worked at companies that might have had either venture funding or or or some of them just didn't like I think one of the things that I found is at at least at a very high growth startup like a VCR that is actually growing it felt kind of very exciting slashstressful and also a bit irrational and by this like at Uber like I remember we had an outage uh in India some of our our payments went down and we did a postmortem of like what what was the damage right like how much money did we lose and the engineer said like actually we saved the business a bunch of money I'm like what do you mean he's like well on every ride we lose an average of $2 in India because we're in growth phase therefore you know we miss 50,000 rides we save like $100,000 and I was like hold on like well actually that that's kind of true true and and this thing would have never happened at another type of company and and you know like I I I I think you're right like it all goes back to to growth and and also I feel it's a mindset because sometimes growth does mean irrational things. For example, we like grew the business knowing we're losing a lot of money like it felt painfully much but in the end I look at where Uber ended up and yeah it it worked out for them for for that specific category.</p>
</details>

盈利能力和增长之间往往存在固有的权衡，尽管 AI 可能正在挑战这一点。如果你把每一分钱都投入到增长中，通常是以单位经济效益不盈利的方式进行的。而一个正常的零售商或餐厅绝不会考虑为了快速增长而让每位顾客点餐都亏钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it's it's a great point that there's this inherent trade-off often times although AI is maybe starting to challenge this uh between profitability and growth. So if you are pouring every single dollar into growth, often times you're doing so in on a unit economics basis unprofitable ways. Whereas a normal business uh if you think of you know a normal retailer or a restaurant or whatever they would never consider, oh we need to grow so fast that we are actually losing money on every time someone comes in and orders dinner. That doesn't make any sense.</p>
</details>

但风投模式就是在初期利用资本，资助极高的增长率，然后通过公司规模变得足够大以主导市场来收获回报。Uber 或许是风投模式运作良好的典范，因为它现在是一家盈利能力很强且仍在快速增长的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the VC model is about using capital at the beginning, funding incredibly high growth rates and then reaping the rewards of those growth rates because the company has gotten so large that they dictate what's going on in the market. So I think actually Uber is perhaps the example of when venture capital works well because now Uber is a very profitable company growing still growing very very quickly.</p>
</details>

然而，也有很多公司接受了风投后，却发现无法达到所需的增长率。这时，投资者会转向下一个赌注，而创始人和员工则不得不收拾残局，这有时会导致投资者和创始人之间的激励机制错位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There are a lot of examples and this is where people kind of get mad at VCs where a company will take venture capital and then it'll turn out that there just wasn't the growth rate there. It wasn't possible to grow as fast as the VCs needed. So the investors go eh whatever we're going to go to our next bet and the founders and employees are left to say well we have to build a company out of this thing that is no longer you know the favored child of these investors. And so there's sometimes are those sort of misaligned incentives between investor and founder.</p>
</details>

### VC 生态的健康状况：融资轮次数量减半

当我们谈论风投支持的初创公司的健康状况时，我们通常默认是指这些公司筹集了多少资金。如果仅以此为标准，风投领域看起来非常强劲和健康。但这些结果通常是幂律分布的，意味着极少数公司筹集了绝大部分资金，比如现在的 OpenAI、XAI 等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think when we talk about the health of VC backed startups a lot of time we by health we kind of default to how much money is being raised by these startups. And if you just go on that basis, VC looks very robust and healthy. But those are typically very very power law outcomes. Meaning there's a tiny cohort of companies that actually end up raising a ton of the money. And right now that's you know we all can list them open AAI, XAI, etc. who are raising billions and billions and billions of dollars.</p>
</details>

但如果你关注的是融资轮次的总数，而不是每轮的融资金额，情况就显得不那么健康了。对于种子轮和 A 轮的早期初创公司，2025 年至今，在 Carta 平台上平均每天有 7.4 轮融资。这个数字大约是 2021 年的一半，并且自 2021 年以来每年都在下降。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you instead look at just the number of rounds raised instead of the amount of capital in each of those rounds, uh the picture looks a little bit less healthy. You know, early stage startups, so seed and series A startups, we saw an average of 7.4 rounds per day on Carta so far in 2025. That is about half of where we were thinking at in 2021, and it's gone down every single year since 2021.</p>
</details>

这意味着获得融资的公司数量减少了。这背后有两个根本原因。首先，风投们发现世界变了。过去他们认为年增长 100% 的公司很棒，现在他们可能在寻找年增长 200% 或 300% 的公司，因为他们看到了像 Cursor 这样的公司已经超越了旧的基准。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, so this means just fewer companies are are raising. It might be bigger rounds or or whatever, but like you know that that that sounds bad, right? Exactly. Fewer companies are raising. Now, why are fewer companies raising? There's a ton of reasons behind this. I think two fundamental ones. First, um, everyone, and by everyone, I mean all the VCs are looking around and going, "Wow, the world has changed. I used to think that a company growing 100% a year was a great company. Now it maybe I'm looking for 200% growth a year or 300% growth per year when I used to look for 100%. Because they have these examples of cursor and other places where these companies are blowing past the old benchmarks.</p>
</details>

其次，可能也是一件好事，有一批公司开始思考，也许我们不需要筹集风险资本。他们打算先努力实现盈利，然后再考虑各种选择，比如接受外部资本或继续自力更生。他们不再将风险投资作为默认的发展路径。这在硅谷尤其明显，过去这种想法并不普遍，但现在生态系统内越来越多地讨论这个话题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second reason and maybe this is a good thing is there are a cohort of companies who are looking around and saying maybe we don't need to raise venture capital. Maybe we are going to build this business and try to get to profitability and then have a lot of options. Maybe we take outside capital, maybe we continue to bootstrap, whatever it is, but we are not going to make VC the default way we build. And that I think has definitely especially in Silicon Valley that did not used to be a very common thing and now it's getting more and more talked about in the ecosystem.</p>
</details>

### AI 对招聘的冲击：团队规模正在缩小

如果你要问 AI 如何影响了初创公司，我认为我们数据中最大的趋势就是：初创公司的招聘人数远少于过去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you're talking about how AI has impacted startups, I think this is the single biggest trend from our data. And the trend is this. Startups are hiring far fewer people than they used to.</p>
</details>

看一下这张显示招聘和离职人数的图表。只看黑色的招聘线：2022 年 1 月，Carta 平台上的公司在一个月内招聘了 73,000 人。2023 年 1 月，他们招聘了 40,000 人。2024 年 1 月，招聘了 32,000 人。我预计到 2025 年 1 月，这个数字大概会在 20,000 人左右。这些数据基于新员工获得的股权授予情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if we just look at this uh showing a chart here with uh hires and departures, but if you just focus on the black line that is hires, in January of 2022, companies on Carta hired 73,000 people in a single month. That's a very high number. In January 2023, they hired 40,000. In January 2024, they hired 32,000. And in January 2025, I think it's going to be like 20,000 or so. And and just to confirm, how how do you track the hires? It's equity allocations. So if a new hire is granted equity, we do now connect into many many many his systems as well.</p>
</details>

从 2022 年到 2023 年，招聘人数大幅下降，这主要是因为资金减少，而不是 AI。从 2023 年到 2024 年，融资困难仍然是主要原因，可能夹杂了一点 AI 的影响。但从 2024 年到 2025 年，以及未来，我们听到了大量的故事：公司说，“我们有一个 10 人的工程团队，我们不需要再招聘第 11 个人，因为 AI 工具让每个工程师的生产力都大大提高了。” 这种现象正在许多公司中蔓延。我不是那种说 AI 不会抢走工作的人，我认为它已经在这么做了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">if you look from 22 to 23, that massive decline in hiring, is that AI? Probably not. That's mostly just people having less funding. Less capital means fewer hires. Easy. 23 to 24. Also true that funding is is a little bit harder. So that's definitely a capital question. Maybe a little bit of AI. But 24 into 25 and 25 into 26, we are just flooded with stories of companies that say, "Look, we have an engineering team of 10, instead of moving that to an engineering team of 11, each one of those 10 engineers is just far more productive than they used to be because of AI tools. So we don't need to hire." And so that is sort of expanded across many, many companies over time, I think, is starting to be an explanation that makes a lot of sense to me. I am not one of those people that says AI is not going to take jobs. I think it kind of already is.</p>
</details>

数据模式非常清晰。以 A 轮融资的公司为例，在 2022 年，当公司完成 A 轮融资时，他们大约有 20 到 22 名全职员工。如今，这个数字更接近 15 人。我预计到今年年底，可能会降到 13 或 12 人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">if you just look at the data as it is today, uh the pattern is is again very clear. So if we just focus on this series A column in 2022 on the day that you raised your series A round companies on Carter were about had about 20 to 22 full-time employees. Today it's more like 15 full-time employees and by the end of the year I think that's probably going to be more like 13 or 12.</p>
</details>

小团队正成为潮流，公司们都在努力控制员工数量，同时尽可能快地增长。这可以归结为一个指标，现在整个硅谷都在谈论它：**ARR per FTE**（每名全职员工的年经常性收入）。这个指标衡量你的资本效率，越来越多的风投在公司生命周期的早期阶段就开始询问这个指标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So this idea that small teams are all the rage and people are trying to keep headcount low and grow as fast as possible just with the people that are currently in the business. It's I think it's very true and a lot of it can be wrapped up in this single metric that everyone across Silicon Valley is now talking about which is ARR per FTE. How much revenue do you have for each employee that works at the business as a measure of how capital efficient you are? That is a metric that many many many more VCs are asking startups for earlier and earlier in their life cycle.</p>
</details>

### 新的黄金标准：更高的收入门槛

这个指标（ARR per FTE）并非新生事物，但其重要性已今非昔比。回到 2021 年，重点就是尽可能快地增长，如果这意味着大量招聘，那就去招。当时人们更关心月活跃用户、总用户数等指标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's not new necessarily in that it's always been a metric that people care about. What's different is the emphasis. So well if we go back to 2021 literally the point was grow as fast as possible and if that means hire a bunch of people hire a bunch of people. We don't actually care that much about the metrics were like monthly average users, total number of users, that kind of stuff, right? It wasn't just about revenue or just growth about ARR change. Yeah, totally.</p>
</details>

随着融资环境收紧，企业和投资者开始更关心现金消耗。现在，如果有可能用 20 个人建立一家拥有 1 亿美元 ARR 的公司，那么它就比同样 ARR 但有 200 名员工的公司更具盈利能力和资本效率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then obviously as funding declines, uh, businesses and their investors get a lot more concerned with how much money are you burning? What's your cash burn per month? Um, and so you're trying to remove that. And now we're in this place where, again, I think this goes back to the examples across the industry. If it's possible to build a company that has a hund00 million of ARR with 20 people, that's a more profitable, more capital efficient company than the same company with 100 million ARR that has 200 people.</p>
</details>

这是来自硅谷银行的数据：在 A 轮融资时，初创公司拥有多少 ARR？2021 年，中位数约为 100 万到 150 万美元。到了 2024 年，这个数字接近 300 万美元。而表现优异的公司（前 25%）的 ARR 更是从 2021 年的水平爆炸式增长，现在在 A 轮时已达到约 700 万美元，是两年前的六倍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, this is data from Silicon Valley Bank. So, this isn't from Carta, but they're Silicon Valley Bank still an ongoing concern, I promise, in Silicon Valley. And this is data on how much ARR, so annual recurring revenue, does a startup have at series A. And in 2021, the median startup had about a million million and a half dollars in ARR. And in 2024, it's nearly $3 million. So it went from 1.3 or so to three and the high end the upper quartortile you know the companies that are doing very well exploded even further. I mean the companies right now on the 75th percentile for ARR have about $7 million of ARR at series A which is like six times as much in two than it was in two years.</p>
</details>

这就是投资者正在关注的。他们会想：“未来的划时代公司会是什么样的？” 如果有公司能以这样的速度增长，那么仅仅是“增长”本身已经不够了，成功的标准已经大大提高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's wildly high. And so that's what investors are looking at. They're going, "What are going to be the generational companies of the future?" Well, if there are companies that are growing at this pace, you know, again, we get back to that original point. Okay, growth just doesn't cut it anymore. The metrics have gotten a lot higher.</p>
</details>

### 理解融资工具：定价轮与 SAFE

在图表中，我们看到了“定价种子轮”（Priced Seed）。这与普通的种子轮有何不同？定价种子轮是指投资者和创始人坐下来，就公司估值达成一致，从而为公司每股股票确定一个价格。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How important are valuations? And by the way, what does price seed mean? In this chart, we have price seed, series A, series B, series C. I know what seed round is. It's the first typically the first time when you invest, you might have an idea or might you might have a product already. What is the price seed? So in this case we said priced seed round in to distinguish it between a seed round that is done on priced equity which is the normal you know you get down you sit in a room with an investor you come to an agreement on valuation which means every one of the shares of your company has a price you have a price per share.</p>
</detais>

另一种方式是通过 **SAFE**（Simple Agreement for Future Equity: 未来股权简单协议）进行融资，这种方式越来越普遍。SAFE 是由 **Y Combinator**（美国著名创业孵化器）推广的一种工具。它非常简单：投资者现在给创始人一笔钱，创始人承诺在未来某个时间点给予投资者公司股权。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">instead you could raise a seed round and this is happening more and more these days on safes simple agreements for future equity and these are this uh newish probably about 10 years old at this point instrument that was popularized by Y Combinator. Um, and the safes are actually pretty fantastic. The document is very simple. It goes, I'm the investor. I'm going to give you, the founder, some money right now, and you're going to give me equity in your business at some point in the future.</p>
</details>

这听起来很奇怪，为什么投资者会接受这样的交易？因为要为一个非常年轻、微小的初创公司确定一个准确的美元估值几乎是不可能的。SAFE 的好处在于，创始人今天就能拿到钱去发展业务，而投资者则获得了在公司发展顺利时获得股权的承诺。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that seems odd, like why would an investor want that deal? And it basically comes back to the idea that valuing putting an actual dollar value on the equity of a very very small young startup is basically impossible. You don't know where this company's going to go. You don't know how fast it's going to grow. This is b this is an idea. It's a bet. It's not a real company quite yet. So the safe is great because the founder gets money to build today and the investor gets the promise of equity if things go well in the future. Um, so that's the distinction between a price round and a safe round.</p>
</details>

### 估值泡沫：AI 与非 AI 公司的冰火两重天

高估值对创始人来说很有诱惑力，因为说“我是一家价值 5000 万美元公司的创始人”感觉很棒。在市场狂热时期，由于对公司未来的极度乐观，估值会飙升。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it does miss a lot of the emotion that happens with earlystage startups, which is it's kind of nice to sit around and say, "I am a $50 million company. I am the founder of a $200 million company." And that when whenever people say that, it is uh referencing the post money valuation that is given to a startup by investors. So actually in times of exuberance a lot of people will see valuations start to skyrocket because there is so much excitement about what this company could be in the future.</p>
</details>

目前在美国，种子阶段公司的**投前估值**（Pre-money Valuation: 投资发生前对公司的估值）中位数约为 1600 万美元。**投后估值**（Post-money Valuation: 投前估值加上本轮融资金额）就是这个数字加上你筹集的资金。例如，如果你以 1600 万美元的投前估值筹集了 300 万美元，那么你的公司投后估值就是 1900 万美元。

<p class="english-text">At seed stage right now in the US the median valuation on Carta is about $16 million pre- money and and pre pre- money means that pre- money means the valuation of the startup before the investment. Post money is just that number plus however much money you raised. Gotcha. Because obviously the cash is the cash is still cash. So you can just use it for as as dollars. So if you raise a $3 million round on a $16 million pre- money valuation, that means your company is worth post money $19 million bucks.</p>
</details>

这其实相当昂贵，甚至比 2021 年市场最火热时还要贵。2021 年是零利率、疫情红利等多种因素共同作用的结果。然后我们经历了 2022 年和 2023 年的低迷。但在低迷之中，ChatGPT 发布了，引发了 AI 的热潮。

<p class="english-text">that's expensive. I mean, that is a pretty expensive seedstage company. It's actually more expensive than the seedstage companies even were in 2021. 2021 was this confluence of things that made it incredibly frothy the way that we talk about it. That's zero interest rates for a decade, the pandemic surplus. All that stuff was happening in 2021. And then in the middle of that downturn the launch of chatbt and so you had a downturn in venture plus a boom in AI.</p>
</details>

所以现在的情况是，AI 公司正乘着新一轮炒作浪潮，前景备受期待；而非 AI 公司则陷入了低迷。因此，根据你所谈论的公司类型，风险投资市场要么前所未有地火热，要么感觉异常寒冷。

<details>

<p class="english-text">and so it's kind of conf this that's what's showing on this chart right now is AI companies in particular have caught this new hype wave and everyone is very excited about their prospects and then non-AI companies are stuck kind of in the middle of a downturn and so it can be really confusing depending on what company you're talking to venture is either never been hotter or feels really really cold.</p>

### 警示信号：过桥融资与估值下降

**过桥融资**（Bridge Round: 在两轮正式融资之间，为帮助公司“渡过难关”而进行的小额融资）通常由现有投资者提供，当公司未能按预期进入下一轮融资（如 A 轮）时，他们会请求更多资金以维持运营。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then there's this thing called bridge rounds. So, a bridge round is a bit more capital typically given to startups by people that are already investors. So, you raised a seed round and then the same people that you raised that seed round from, you go back to them and say, "Look, we couldn't get to series A the way that we thought we could. We need a little bit more cash today so that hopefully we can then eventually get to series A."</p>
</details>

不幸的是，我们的数据显示，过桥融资通常不是好的赌注。在种子轮和 A 轮之间需要过桥融资的公司，最终成功进入 A 轮的比例远低于那些不需要过桥融资的公司。这很直观，如果一切顺利，你根本不需要请求更多资金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Unfortunately, our data shows pretty clearly that bridge rounds are not usually good bets. uh you know they the the percentage of companies that make it from a seed to a series A that had to do a bridge in the middle is much lower than the ones that didn't have to do a bridge. And that that's kind of obvious, right? You wouldn't be asking for more capital if everything was going great.</p>
</details>

数据显示，2020 年，约 33% 的定价过桥融资成功了。但到 2021 年，这一比例降至 16%，2022 年更是骤降至 8%。这意味着，如果你所在的公司正在进行过桥融资，根据最新数据，它成功进入下一轮的几率大约只有 8%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If we look a little bit closer, if we go back to the bridge round in 2020, about 33% of price bridge rounds worked out. So, so from seed, this company did get the series A after they got extended, but then this dropped in 2021 to 16 and in the 2022 to 8%. Which means it drops like four times. As per the latest data, there might be a roughly 8% chance that your company will make it to seed and probably 92% or 91% that it might fold.</p>
</details>

另一个警示信号是**估值下降轮**（Down Round），即公司以低于上一轮的估值进行融资。从文化上讲，这通常被视为一种“承认”事情进展不顺的信号。由于初创公司的世界里，形象和制造兴奋感非常重要，因此估值下降对创始人来说可能极具挑战性。他们必须回去告诉员工，公司的价值比想象中要低，这可能会导致员工开始考虑离职。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In addition to a bridge round, there are these things called down rounds which just mean anytime a company raises at a lower valuation than what they raised at before. And instinctively that shouldn't be that big of a deal. But in culturally it doesn't really work like that. like taking a down round is often time this quote unquote admission that things are not working well and so much of startups is optics and like trying to look like the rocket ships and trying to manufacture excitement. A down round can be really challenging for founders because they got to go back to their employees their engineers and say we are worth less than we thought and when they do that a lot of the engineers might think, okay, well, maybe it's time for me to dust off my resume.</p>
</details>

### AI 时代的新趋势：单人创始人崛起

AI 已经彻底改变了初创公司的构建方式。我们最清晰的发现之一是，**单人创始人**（Solo Founder）公司变得越来越普遍。随着创业成本的降低，以及单人能完成的事情越来越多，过去需要联合创始人的工作，现在可能一个人就能启动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">AI has changed the way that startups are being built. Hands down. One of the clearest findings is that solo founded companies, so literally just one founder, have become more and more common over time. They're taking greater and greater share of startups. And that is for, I'd hope, pretty obvious reasons, right? the as the cost of creating a business comes down as you can do more as a single person, well maybe you just you used to have to have a co-founder but you just get started yourself.</p>
</details>

2024 年，在 Carta 上成立的初创公司中，超过三分之一是单人创始人公司，这是有史以来的最高比例。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So in 2024 it was over a third of startups uh that were founded that use Carta are solo founded startups which is the highest it's ever been.</p>
</details>

然而，有趣的是，风投们仍然对投资单人创始人感到犹豫。虽然约 35% 的公司是单人创办的，但在获得风投融资的公司中，只有约 17% 是单人创始人。风投不青睐单人创始人的原因有很多：传统的“技术+商业”双核团队模式、关键人物风险，以及一个隐藏的观点——如果你连一个联合创始人都说服不了，你可能也无法吸引其他人才。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The flip side of that pattern though is VCs still have trouble funding solo founders. They don't love them. It's about 35% of companies on Carta are solo founded. But if you just look at those who have received VC funding, it's about 17% in 2024. So that's a big gap. And when we talk to VCs, they have a lot of reasons why they don't love solo founders. The older reasons used to be, well, it's very important to have a technical lead and a business lead. It also comes to the idea of key person risk. And then the I think the hidden reason uh oftent times is because there is this kind of unspoken idea that if you can't convince a co-founder to join you, you're really not going to be able to convince anyone else.</p>
</details>

### 融资周期变长与“僵尸”初创公司

过去，初创公司融资的普遍法则是每 18 到 24 个月进行一轮新融资。但现在，这个周期已经大大延长。数据显示，从种子轮到 A 轮的中位数时间可能需要两年半，从 A 轮到 B 轮可能接近三年。这对创始人的明确启示是：你必须让手头的资金维持更长时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It used to be that you would raise perfect advice. You know, the 18 to 24month period was the median for a long time, for many years. And now it might be 2 and 1/2 years between seed and series A. it might be almost three years between series A and series B. So if you're a founder, the clear takeaway from this chart is you will probably have to make the money you have today last longer than you expected.</p>
</details>

此外，从种子轮“毕业”到 A 轮的成功率也在变化。在 2021 年的繁荣时期，这个比例可能高达 50%。而现在，你应该预期大约只有 25% 到 30% 的种子轮公司最终能筹集到 A 轮。这意味着超过一半的公司将无法成功晋级。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">exactly right the graduation rate is the thing that we talk about a lot with investors which is what percent of seedstage startups ever raise a series A and in the boom times in 2021 or So it could be as high as half which is very high. And now that risk is definitely back. So on average I would say that you should expect about 25 maybe 30% of startups that raise seed rounds to end up raising a series A round. So that means more than half of them will not make it.</p>
</details>

一个棘手的话题是，有很多在 2021 年或更早筹集了种子轮的初创公司，它们仍然存活着，但基本上停滞不前。问题是，这些人是否应该关闭公司？硅谷文化中充满了“永不放弃”的故事，比如 Figma 和 Slack，但每一个成功案例背后，都有数百个失败的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There are a lot of startups that raised a seed round in 2021 or earlier that are still live businesses but are basically just not going anywhere. And the question really becomes should those people shut the business down or not? That's a really difficult question. And for every single one of Slack or Figma as examples, there are hundreds of companies who did not make it.</p>
</details>

对创始人来说，如果业务确实无法达到风投所期望的增长，关闭它并尝试下一个想法，可能是一个更好的选择。投资者通常也愿意支持那些从失败中吸取了教训的创始人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So really what this chart shows to me is there's a founder talent example here where it's like I want these talented founders if they need to to shut their businesses down and try the next idea. Oftentimes, you know, there are founders uh our our my CEO Henry is a fantastic example. Carta is not Henry's first business. Carta is Henry's second business and the first one did not go very well but he learned a ton of lessons in it and that it kind of built all this equity with investors so that when he started Carta he had a much better idea of what he was doing.</p>
</details>

### 对员工和求职者的建议

作为一名工程师，在加入一家风投支持的公司之前，你应该像投资者一样思考。这家公司的独特技术优势或护城河是什么？在 AI 能够快速复制功能的时代，为什么这家公司能赢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The framework and the mental model that you should be using as an engineer joining this company is the same as though you were an investor. So put yourself in the mind of a VC and say what do I think of this company in in contra distinction to all the other companies in their space. How fast are they growing? Obviously important. What is their unique technological edge if there is one? So this is something that VCs talk about a lot, which is what is your moat? What is your defensibility? Why in a world where AI can spin up product features in a weekend, why are you the company that's going to win in this space?</p>
</details>

如果你加入的是一家种子轮或 A 轮的公司，你很大程度上是在押注创始人。你需要对创始人有信心，相信他们是你想追随的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you're joining a seed or series A firm, in many cases, what you're doing is you're betting on that founder. So the first thing that you need to be doing is being comfortable with the founder themselves and saying, "This is the kind of person that I want to follow and I believe in strongly will have the next great idea to keep us ahead of the pack."</p>
</details>

在初创公司，除了技术能力，个人技能也至关重要。你很可能需要扮演“球员兼教练”的角色，亲自动手写代码。你还需要成为一个“瑞士军刀”，参与到纯代码之外的事务中，比如与客户交谈、评估市场。这正是初创公司的魔力所在：你不仅能提升编码技能，更能极大地拓展对整个行业和商业运作的认知。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the difference at a startup is there are different personal skills that come into play at startups versus big tech companies. At a startup, you're very likely to have a small or even non-existent team. So, player coach comes into the idea here. The other thing about startups is it gets back to that idea that there's a Swiss Army knife aspect to it. You're going to be asked to get involved in stuff that is not just pure code, right? You're going to be asked to talk to a bunch of customers. You're going to be asked to evaluate market maps. So, it's not just a pure technical exercise. you're going to have to start upleveling your ideas about the business. And that I think is the hidden magic of startups where you would leave a startup after 2 years and look back and go, "Yeah, my coding skills got better, but wow, I upleveled so much of my knowledge on this space and the way that businesses grow and shrink and compete."</p>

### 成为顾问：期望与现实

成为初创公司顾问通常会获得少量股权。很多人期望能拿到公司 1% 的股权，但这非常高。根据我们的数据，2024 年 5000 名顾问的股权授予中位数是 0.25%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Advising a startup often times comes along with getting a little bit of equity in that startup. Often times when I talk to advisers, they say what we're looking for is about 1% of the business as the equity package for advisers. That is very high. The median amount that is granted to advisers across we had 5,000 adviserss in this study in 2024 is 0.25%.</p>
</details>

作为对比，如今科技初创公司的第一位员工（通常是工程师）的中位数股权是 1.5%。考虑到顾问并非全职工作，每月只贡献几个小时，0.25% 的股权就显得合理多了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, so a quarter of 1%. Well, let's put this in uh context with how much employees are given. So the first hire at a tech startup these days, which is, by the way, almost always an engineer. They typically receive on median 1.5% of the business. So in that context, an adviser getting 0.25% makes a lot of sense because the adviser is not working here full-time. They are probably contributing a handful of hours a month or a quarter.</p>
</details>

对初创公司最有价值的顾问有两类：一类是技术顾问，拥有解决特定领域高难度技术问题的世界级专业知识；另一类是商业顾问，能够为公司引荐关键客户，直接带来收入。那些每月只开一次会、泛泛而谈商业计划的顾问，其价值远没有他们想象的那么高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There are certain kinds of adviserss that are worth tons of money to startups. There are in my mind there are two kinds. One is a technical adviser. I have a friend who used to work at Uber and at deep deep knowledge of how to run marketplace matching algorithms. He is a world expert at this thing. The other kind of adviser that is really valuable to startups is someone who can actually introduce you to customers. Those are the two kinds of advisors like very technical help or commercial help that are most common in startups. the adviser that sits down with you once a month or once a quarter and goes over a business plan or talks to you about your marketing website, I would generally say they're just not worth nearly as much as some of them think they are.</p>
