### 达沃斯的初印象

**Jason**: David 和我住在一栋有 300 年历史的房子里，我们俩的头都已经撞到梁上两次了。不过，这都是我们第一次参加**达沃斯 (Davos)**。David，我们已经在这儿待了 24 小时了，有什么初步印象吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: David and I are staying in a 300-year-old house and uh we've both smashed our head on the beams twice already. Uh but this is both our first Davos, David. It's our first Davos. We've been here for 24 hours and um uh any first impressions here.

</details>

**David**: 嗯，挺有意思的。你知道，我们住得很远。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Um it's interesting. You know, we're we're staying very far away.

</details>

**Jason**: 是啊，显然他们不想让你参与其中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Yeah, they didn't apparently they didn't want you to be part of this.

</details>

**David**: 他们不想让我靠得太近。没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: They didn't want me too close. Yeah.

</details>

**Jason**: 但我们最终还是为你弄到了邀请函。你的邀请函终于没在邮寄过程中弄丢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: But we finally we got you finally got you an invitation. your invitation to not get lost in the mail.

</details>

**David**: 这次我的邀请函确实没弄丢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: My invitation didn't get lost in the mail this time.

</details>

**Jason**: 看过我们播客的人都知道我在说什么。这是一个内部梗。嗯，很高兴能来到这里，也很高兴能在 **USA House** 录制。感谢所有的赞助商。我们非常荣幸邀请到播客的第一位嘉宾：**Sarah Rogers**。她是**美国国务院 (State Department)** 负责**公共外交 (Public Diplomacy)** 的副国务卿。对于那些不了解这个职位、不清楚你的职责或工作内容的人，我很好奇：是他们告诉你该做什么，还是你自己制定工作目标？请告诉我们你正在做的一切。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: For those of you who watch the pod, you know what I'm talking about. Inside joke. Um, but it's great to be here and uh great to be here at USA House. Thanks to all the sponsors and um really delighted for our first guest for the pod. Sarah Rogers works for is the under secretary uh for public diplomacy at the State Department. for members here who don't know this position or what you've been charged with or what you've decided to work on. I'm curious about that. Do they tell you what to do or do you come up with your own mandate? But yeah, tell us everything about what you're doing.

</details>

### 何为公共外交

**Sarah Rogers**: 我是你们的长期听众，这是我第一次作为嘉宾参加。谢谢你们两位。也代表美国之家的所有人，感谢你们的加入。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: Longtime listener, first time guest and thank you to both of us. Uh thank you from all of us at America House for joining us here.

</details>

**Jason**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Yeah.

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 我是负责公共外交的副国务卿。当我获得提名时，我的亲朋好友都向我表示祝贺，然后接着问：“那是什么职位？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: So I am the under secretary for public diplomacy and when I got this nomination, my friends and family all congratulated me and then conferably said what is that?

</details>

**Jason**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Yeah.

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 传统外交关注的是美国政府与其他外国政府之间的关系。两位大使握手、达成协议、解决战争。但公共外交不同，它处理的是美国政府与**外国公众**之间的关系。随着互联网的兴起，尤其是在拜登政府期间，由于对所谓“虚假信息”的担忧日益增加，以及所谓的恶意影响对美国公众看法和利益的干扰，这个副国务卿职位变得非常重要。如何与互联网和信息生态系统互动，是我职责的一部分。我还负责监管其他**软实力 (Soft Power)** 活动，包括教育、文化和体育外交。我很荣幸能在今年夏天的世界杯、即将到来的洛杉矶奥运会以及**富布赖特项目 (Fulbright Program)** 等活动中发挥作用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: Uh so diplomacy traditionally concerns the relationship between the American government and foreign governments. Two ambassadors, shake hands, make a deal, um solve a war. But public diplomacy is different. Public diplomacy addresses the relationship between the American government and foreign publics. And this has become a very important under secretariat with the rise of the internet and then during the Biden administration especially uh these mushrooming concerns about so-called disinformation and what do we do when there are allegedly malign influences on the public view of America um the public's intersection with American interest how do we interact with the internet and the information ecosystem that is part of my portfolio I also oversee other soft power activities including our educational and cultural and sports diplomacy. So I am privileged to play a role in the World Cup this summer and the LA Olympics coming up and uh the Fulbright program and others like it. So

</details>

### 欧美言论自由冲突

**Jason**: 你似乎特别关注**言论自由 (Freedom of Speech)**，以及我们的标准与美国公司之间的张力。这些公司现在正强烈转向支持言论自由。这在科技行业曾一度被忽视，但现在取得了显著进展。看起来欧洲的一些人并不认同我们对言论自由的热爱。也许你可以向我们解释一下现在的紧张局势是什么，以及欧洲已经实施了哪些监管规定？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: you seem particularly focused on freedom of speech and a little bit of tension between our standards and the companies in America which have made the move to being strongly freedom of speech. something that kind of got lost in our industry for a couple years in technology but has now made I think um some significant progress on does seem like some folks in Europe don't share our love of freedom of speech. Maybe you could explain to us what the tension is today and what some of the regulations are that have been put in place in Europe.

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 当然。我上任以来接触到的主要有两项法规，部分原因是我第一次正式出访就是去欧洲。当时，美国平台 **X** 正因欧盟的**《数字服务法》(DSA)** 面临巨额罚款。自二战以来，尤其是自美国建国并将**第一修正案 (First Amendment)** 编纂入法以来，美国在言论自由方面采取了比大多数西方国家更强硬的立场。随着互联网的兴起，大量通信变得跨国化。我们看到欧洲这些新的技术官僚监管框架与美国的言论自由承诺发生了碰撞。Jason 观察得很准，曾几何时，一些美国大型科技平台更倾向于根据美国当时流行的一些规范和担忧进行内容审查。但我认为，现在美国已经转向了一种较少审查的方式，这些平台也是如此。与此同时，欧洲和英国也在加强监管。我举两个特别相关的例子：英国有一项**《在线安全法》(Online Safety Act)**，它对广泛的内容施加了年龄限制义务，几乎涵盖了任何令人不快的内容，并要求平台进行风险评估，在某些情况下删除英国认为非法的某些内容。在英国，许多在平台所在地、高管居住地及主要监管国——美国——并不违法的内容，都被列为非法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: Sure. Absolutely. So the two main regulations that I've interfaced with since taking office and part of this is just a product of my first official trip was to Europe and while I was in Europe a large fine came down on an American platform X under the digital services act which I'll get into a moment. So Europe um especially since since the second world war but I think really since the American founding and our codification of the first amendment you know America has taken a much stronger approach on free speech than even most of the west and with the rise of the internet and all communication or a lot of communication becoming transnational. We see these new technocratic regulatory frameworks in Europe bumping up against the commitments to free speech in the United States. And Jason makes an important observation that for a while some of these large American technology platforms were more inclined to moderate or to censor kind of in conformity with some prevailing um some prevailing norms and concerns in the United States. But I think in the United States we've shifted back toward a less centurious approach and so have these platforms. And at the same time, you have uh regulatory efforts in Europe and the UK. And I'll I'll name a couple that I think have been particularly relevant. So the UK has something called the online safety act. The online safety act imposes age gating obligations on a broad swath of content, almost any content that's upsetting, and then requires platforms to run risk assessments for and in some cases remove content that the UK would say is illegal. And in the UK, you know, major categories of content are banned, are rendered illegal. That would not be illegal in the United States, which is where these platforms are located, which is where their original user base is, which is where their executives live um and which is their primary regulator.

</details>

### 跨国监管与审查关税

**Sarah Rogers**: 根据《在线安全法》，相关监管机构目前正对几家美国网站进行诉讼。这些网站甚至没有进入英国市场，不是专门讨论英国女王的，也不在英国销售商品。它们存在于美国土地上，拥有大量美国用户，经常讨论美国政治话题。但因为用户被允许以违反英国法律的方式讨论这些话题，英国就对其处以罚款。欧盟的《数字服务法》(DSA) 也很类似。DSA 不仅包含基于内容的监管，还有仇恨言论监管。它要求所有欧盟成员国至少采纳一个禁止仇恨言论的底线。我认为法典中的这些禁令比美国律师习惯的要模糊得多。美国第一修正案的一个法理原则是：如果你要制定任何涉及言论的法规，必须非常明确禁止的内容，因为存在**寒蝉效应 (Chilling Effect)**。模糊的禁令会抑制言论，尤其是当这种禁令强加给大型风险厌恶型企业时。你对大型风险厌恶型企业施加模糊禁令，结果就是连在饮水机旁开个玩笑都可能变得“非法”。DSA 还监管数字商务和社交媒体的其他方面，如透明度和竞争。今天观众席里有很多欧洲人，我希望如果我建议欧洲更倾向于将技术官僚监管作为“什么是可接受的”仲裁者，而美国传统上更强调**个人主义**和个人良知，他们不会觉得这有争议。需要明确的是，没有人（当然不是国务院或美国）说：“嘿，你们在欧洲不能拥有自己的平台”，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: So, under the online safety act, we now have um active litigation by the relevant regulator against several American websites. These are websites that don't reach into the UK. They're not these aren't websites dedicated to discussing the queen. They're not websites that sell goods in the United Kingdom. These are websites that exist on American soil, host large quantities of American users, and in often in oftentimes discuss American political topics. But because users are permitted to discuss them in a way that offends UK law, there's the imposition of a UK fine. The Digital Services Act in the EU is similar. So DSA contains but doesn't just contain uh contentbased regulations, hate speech regulations. So DSA requires all of the EU member states to adopt at minimum kind of a floor for hate speech prohibition. And those prohibitions in the statute, I think, are much vagger than American lawyers are accustomed to. And one of our one of our jurist credential principles under the American First Amendment is if you're going to enact any regulation that comes close to touching speech, it needs to be very clear what you are prohibiting because you have this chilling effect concept. A vague prohibition will chill speech, especially when that prohibition is imposed on a large riskaverse corporation. So you impose vague prohibitions on large riskaverse corporations and that's how it becomes illegal to make jokes around the water cooler for example. You see the same effect here. Digital services act also regulates other aspects of um digital commerce and social media. So it regulates um things like transparency and competition. And I think you know we have we have a lot of Europeans in the audience today and I hope none of them will find it contentious if I suggest that in Europe there is more of a focus on uh technocratic regulation as an arbiter of what's acceptable than there might be in America where we have this tradition that um really emphasizes like rugged individualism and individual conscience. And to be clear, no one is saying, certainly not the State Department or America, hey, you can't have your own platforms in Europe, right?

</details>

**Jason**: 那就自己建一个。建你们自己的 Facebook、Instagram、Twitter/X 或 TikTok，随你们怎么建，你们可以在自己的平台上设定任何标准。我们说的是：“嘿，这是我们的平台，这是我们的标准，我们不希望我们的用户或平台收到罚款。”这就是我们的立场。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Build your own. Build your own Facebook, build your own Instagram, build your own Twitter/X, uh, Tik Tok, whatever you'd like to build, and you can have whatever standards you like on your platforms. We're saying, "Hey, these are our platforms. This is our standard, and we don't want our users uh or our platforms to be receiving fines." That's that's our position.

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 我认为基本上就是这样。听着，当美国公司在海外运营时，它们会遵守当地法律。但在某种程度上——我们最近发布了一些制裁措施，稍后会详细说明。我们制裁的其中一个人是前欧盟官员，他曾威胁要对 **Elon Musk** 采取执法行动，因为 X 在美国境内表示将主持一场对我们的总统**唐纳德·特朗普 (Donald Trump)** 的直播采访。并不是特朗普说了什么违规的话，也不是欧盟想禁止某段具体内容，仅仅是因为一家美国企业采访美国总统这一行为可能违反了欧盟对言论的偏好，就产生了一种监管威胁。当你跨境发出这样的威胁时，这就侵犯了美国的利益和价值观。你可以预料到美国会做出回应。我以前是美国法院的律师，我们是一个拥有 50 个州的国家，每个州都有自己的法规。我们必须思考，当加州的网站在德州运营时，如何决定德州的监管权限？我们有各种管辖权概念，比如网站是否“蓄意利用”该论坛，或者你是否发布了关于德州某人的诽谤言论。但仅仅因为德州不喜欢加州某个网站的存在，这几乎从未成为监管的依据。所以当我们谈论**域外管辖权 (Extraterritoriality)** 时，我们真正讨论的是：毫无疑问，欧洲人可以在欧洲拥有自己的法律，但我们在美国也可以拥有自己的法律。我们正在庆祝美国独立 250 周年，我们希望我们的市场能够在网上互联互通，但我们不愿以牺牲美国的言论自由为代价。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: I I think I think that's basically it. And look, when American companies operate abroad, they abide by the laws where they operate. But at a certain point, so so we recently issued some sanctions, which we'll get into. And one of the individuals we sanctioned uh was a former EU official who threatened Elon Musk with enforcement action because X within the United States had said that it was going to host on a live uh Twitter space an interview with Donald Trump, our president. So it wasn't that Donald Trump had said anything violative. It wasn't there was a specific piece of content that the EU wanted to ban. It was just that the act of an American business hosting an interview with an American president might offend EU uh EU preferences about speech generated a regulatory threat. And when you reach across borders and make a threat like that, that offends American interests and American values. And so you can expect America to respond. And I think so I my history is as an American lawyer in American courts and we have you know we're a nation of 50 states and each state has its own regulations and we've had to think about you know when there's a website in California that operates in Texas how do you decide to what extent Texas gets to regulate and we have all these jurisdictional concepts like does the website purposefully avail itself of the forum is it is are you posting defamatory statements about a person in Texas but the mere existence of a website in California that Texas doesn't like is hardly ever, basically never, a basis for regulation. And so when we talk about things like extr territoriality, you know, what we're really talking about is it's undisputed that Europeans get to have their own laws in Europe, but we also get to have our own laws in the United States. And we're celebrating 250 years of American independence. And so we want, you know, we want our markets to be able to interoperate online. Um, but we're not willing to give up American freedom of speech and the bargain.

### 英国的言论审查现状

**Jason**: 嘿，David，我想问你这个问题，这样可以让你避避嫌。你认为英国人为什么这么害怕言论自由？尤其是最喧闹的平台 X？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Hey, David, when we look at, and I'm asking you this one so I can give you a pass on it, but what what do you think people are so scared of in the UK when it comes to freedom of speech? Uh, and and maybe the most freedom of the the most um rockus platform X specifically.

</details>

**David**: 我不认为民众害怕。我认为是政府害怕民众批评它，因此他们正在做审查者一直在做的事情：保护掌权者。Sarah，你应该给我们解释一下，据我了解，已经有超过 12,000 人根据《在线安全法》被起诉或逮捕了？那是仅在一年内，还是自法案实施以来？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Well, I don't think the people are afraid. I think the government is afraid of the people criticizing it and therefore they're engaged in what sensors always do which is protect the people in power. Um there's something Sarah you you should explain this to us but as I understand there have been over 12,000 people is it prosecuted or arrested under the online safety act. Was that just in one year or is that since it

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 那仅在 2023 年一年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: that that was in 2023 alone?

</details>

**David**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Okay.

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 但这不仅仅是根据《在线安全法》。我认为像 OSA（在线安全法）和 DSA 这样法律的特别阴险和相关之处在于，它们是现有审查法律应用于互联网的入口。很多英国人是根据现有的法律被捕的，比如《通信法》，或者禁止煽动所谓“种族或宗教仇恨”的法律。我认为美国和英国对于什么构成“煽动”存在分歧。例如，有一位名叫 Graeme Linehan 的喜剧演员，他发推文说，如果一个女人在女厕所看到生殖器，她应该可以踢那个人的蛋。这是很多喜剧演员会说的话，我认为这反映了许多美国人和欧洲人认为是常识的冲动。但他像恐怖分子一样被从机场拖走，没收了设备，被关了一夜，据我回忆，他还失去了服用心脏药物的机会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: But that isn't just under the online safety act. So I think what's particularly insidious and particularly relevant about statutes like the OSA and the DSA is that these are portals through which existing censorship laws get applied to the internet. So a lot of these Brits are arrested under um ex of under existing statutes like there's a communications act, there's a law against inciting quote unquote racial or religious hatred. And we, I think, have differences of opinion about, you know, what amounts to incitement in America versus the UK. But so, for example, uh, you had a comedian called Graeme Lahan who tweeted that, um, if a woman sees a penis in a in a ladies room, you know, she should feel free to kick that guy in the balls. And that's that's something a lot of comedians say, and I think it channels an impulse that a lot of Americans and Europeans would frankly consider common sense. But he was dragged out of the airport like a terrorist, had his devices confiscated, was thrown in jail overnight and lost access, my understanding is to his heart medication if I recall correctly.

</details>

**Jason**: 因为这被视为煽动暴力？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: And because this was an incitement to violence

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 因为这违反了英国现有的反对“挑衅性言论”的法律，而《在线安全法》是将所有这些现有法律应用于互联网的工具。英国还有另一个案例，足球运动员 Joey Barton 称某人为“bike nonce”（骑自行车的变态）。“nonce”不是美国术语，但我猜是在影射某人因为骑自行车的方式而显得娘娘腔。这导致了缓刑，但仍然是监禁判决。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: because this offended some existing law against uh provocative speech in the UK and the the online safety act is a device through which all of those existing laws get applied to the internet. You had another case in the UK where Joey Breton, a footballer, um, called somebody a bike nonce, which nonce is not an American term, but I imagine you're insinuating someone is affeminate for riding a bike so much or in the manner that he rides the bike. And that resulted in a suspended prison sentence, but still a prison sentence

</details>

**Jason**: 就因为他叫某人“变态”？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: because he called somebody desty.

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 基本上是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: Yeah. Basically,

</details>

**Jason**: 这就是我们在美国所说的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: that's what we call in United States.

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 还有一些其他的推文，但都没有达到美国法律中“煽动”的标准。所以，David，你是完全正确的。仅在一年内，就有略多于 12,000 名英国人因言论行为被捕，这比同年在俄罗斯、中国或土耳其被捕的人数还要多。当你和英国人谈论这件事时，大多数英国人会说这是完全不可接受的。如果你看英国的民调，你会看到反对这种做法的公众情绪。但我与这些国家的监管机构进行过公开和私下的接触，听到的辩护是：“嗯，你知道，我们的环境比中国更宽松、没那么极权，所以也许更多人愿意违反规则、愿意冒犯他人。”但如果你每年因为言论逮捕 12,000 人，并且让孩子们在一个可能因为冒犯跨性别激进主义教条就被从机场拖走的生态系统中长大……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: And there were there was there were some other tweets, too, but none none that would meet the bar for American incitement. So, David, you're absolutely right. So that was in a single year of slightly over 12,000 Brits arrested for speech acts and that is more than more than we're arrested that year in Russia, more than in China, more than in Turkey. And when you talk to Brits about this, you know, you're absolutely right. Most of the British people that you talk to say this is totally unacceptable. And if you look at the polls in the UK, you see public sentiment against this kind of thing. But I've I've had, you know, both public and private engagements with regulators in these countries. And the defense you hear is well, you know, we have a less chilling, less totalitarian environment than China. So maybe more people are willing to break the rules, more people are willing to offend. But if you arrest 12,000 people a year for speech and you're raising children in an ecosystem where you can be dragged out of the airport for offending the dogmas of transgender activism,

</details>

**David**: 那么你的文化可能很快就会变得和中国没什么两样。而且，如果这就是你们所执行的价值观，为什么美国还要出钱保卫你们的国家，支持你们打针对俄罗斯的代理人战争呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: then you might not have a different culture than China for long. And and why should the United States be paying to defend your country and support it in fighting say a proxy war against Russia if that's basically the values that are being enforced.

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 没错。当我们在北约背景下与北约盟友互动时，我们经常听到关于共同历史和共同价值观的说法。现在是时候问问，我们还拥有哪些共同价值观？二战后，我们与盟友共同构成了自由世界，这个自由世界是为了对抗共产主义而组建的。但任何自由社会的基石必须是言论自由。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: Right. Exactly. When we interact with our NATO allies in the NATO context, we hear a lot about our shared history and shared values. And it's time to ask, you know, what values do we still share? We together with our allies comprised the free world after World War II and the free world that was assembled against communism. But the cornerstone of a free world of any free society has to be freedom of speech

</details>

**Jason**: 保护那些令人不快的言论才是真正的防御所在。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: and criticizing and the uncomfortable speech is where this actual defense is necessary.

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: Yes.

</details>

**Jason**: 在美国，我们有一种非常特殊的倾向，那就是真的会去抨击我们的领导人。我每周都和 David 一起做这件事，既然他现在是公职人员了。我是说，我们火力全开。而他们竟然因为有人说“嘿，我可能对天主教会持有不同意见，虽然我本人是天主教徒”就去敲人家的门。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: And we have a very special, you know, bent in the United States to really go after our leaders. I do it every week with David um since he's now a public servant. I mean, we go at it and they're knocking on people's doors strictly for saying like, "Hey, you know, I I might have disagreements with the Catholic Church. I'm a Catholic."

</details>

### 移民政策与双重标准执法

**David**: 很大程度上是关于移民的，对吧？我在 X 上看到过很多这样的例子。我看到一个片段，一名法官对某人判处两年监禁，据称是因为该言论批评了英国开放的移民政策。我觉得很多起诉都集中在那里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Well, a lot of it's about immigration, right? I mean, so I've seen a bunch of these examples, you know, on X. I saw um one clip on X where a judge was handing down a 2-year sentence against somebody. I don't know if if this rings a bell, but supposedly for speech that I think was criticizing the UK's open immigration policies. That's where I sense a lot of the the prosecutions are. Right.

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 没错。这是另一个言论自由和表达自由本身就是美国的价值观和利益的地方。但本届政府的另一个优先事项是在大规模移民问题上的常识。很多触怒掌权者的言论都与移民政策有关。英国有一位名叫 Lucy Connelly 的郊区母亲被判处 31 个月监禁。起因是一个叫 Axel Rudabanka 的男人在生日派对上刺伤了三名分别是 7 岁、8 岁和 9 岁的小女孩。随后发生了动乱，她发了一条反移民的推文，言辞非常激烈，但在美国这无疑是合法的。她说：“如果这就是移民对我们国家的影响（我稍微转述一下，但我记得很清楚），如果这就是移民的意义，那么烧掉移民酒店我也无所谓。”这是一位失去孩子的悲伤母亲，她看到三个小女孩无缘无故被谋杀，她做出了反应，然后感到后悔并删除了推文。结果被判刑 31 个月。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: Right. And this is another place where, you know, free speech and freedom of expression are American values and interests in and of themselves. But another priority for the administration is common sense on mass migration. And a lot of the speech that offends those in power has to do with migration policy. So, there was a 31-month sentence handed down to a suburban mother named Lucy Connelly in the UK uh because after a man called Axel Rudabanka stabbed I think it was a seven-year-old girl, an 8-year-old girl, and a nine-year-old girl at a birthday party. There was ensuing unrest and she she tweeted uh something anti-migration and it was pretty inflammatory, but it would have been unambiguously legal in the United States. Um, she said, 'If this is what migration is going to do to our country, and I'm paraphrasing slightly, but I remember it pretty well. If this is what migration means, then burn down the migrant hotels for all I care. Uh, this was a berieved mother who' lost a child. She saw three little girls murdered for no reason. And she reacted and then she felt bad and she deleted the tweet. That was a 30 31-month sentence.

</details>

**Jason**: 31 个月？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: 31 month

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 在英国被判刑 31 个月。与此同时，真正的恋童癖、真正的儿童性犯罪者在英国却只获得极少的刑期甚至不入狱。这导致了英国活动人士中流行的一个词——所谓的**“双重标准执法” (Two-tier Policing)**。他们集结起来是因为他们感觉到，如果你反对大规模移民，如果你发表那样的批评，你将面临与那些仅仅在英国煽动沙里亚法或仅仅下载儿童色情作品的人完全不同的司法系统。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: 31month sentence in the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, you have actual pedophiles, actual child sex offenders who get minimal prison or none in the United Kingdom. And that that's led to this um epithet that you hear among UK activists, this quote unquote two-tier policing, this activist cause that they've assembled around because they sense that if you oppose mass migration, if you make that kind of critique, you are subject to a different justice system than the kind of person who merely agitates for Sharia law in Britain or merely downloads child pornography in Britain.

</details>

**Jason**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Yeah. So, okay. So,

</details>

**David**: 我强调这一点是为了……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: I emphasized that for

</details>

**Jason**: 是的，我想……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Yeah. So I mean so I think um

</details>

**David**: 那是正义之钟。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: that was the gong of righteousness.

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 我们很感激。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: We appreciate it.

### 针对美国公司的“审查税”

**Jason**: 再补充一个维度。美国公司在英国和欧盟一直被疯狂罚款，我认为这与此有关。你能描述一下吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: And then just to add one more dimension to this uh so US companies have been getting fined like crazy right in the UK and then the EU. Um and I think it's related to this issue but can you just describe that like

</details>

**David**: 是的，因为这已经从盟友做了一些我们认为疯狂的事，演变成了直接损害美国的利益，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Yeah. Um because that that's where this crosses over into you know an ally doing something that we think is mad into directly hurting American interests I guess right or

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 没错。我不认为英国《在线安全法》目前已经开出了任何巨额罚款，但它的条款是逐步生效的，有些条款现在才上线，包括涉及 AI 的部分。我们在美国法院也有正在进行的诉讼。其中一个领先的诉讼涉及 **4chan** 网站，经常上网的美国人可能很熟悉。4chan 基本上是一个没有任何限制的、产生模因 (Meme) 的原始汤。猫咪模因出自那里，“占领华尔街”运动也出自那里，但 4chan 基本上没有审查规则，除了禁止儿童色情。因此，英国决定不允许 4chan 存在，除非它向英国支付一大笔钱，因为它没有按照英国法律监管其言论。在我最近的欧洲之行中，X 收到了一笔巨额罚款，我相信大约是 1.4 亿欧元，也可能是美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: right so I don't believe there have been any big fines under the UK online safety act yet but um its provisions take effect over time and some of those provisions are just coming online now including the ones relating to AI okay and we have active litigation in American courts right now. Um, one of the leading lawsuits involves the website 4chan, which people who are very online in America may be familiar with. 4chan is kind of a no holdsbred uh promodial soup for memes and the like. The cat memes come out of there. A lot of activism Occupy Wall Street came out of 4chan, but 4chan has essentially no censorship rules. It bans child pornography. That's pretty much it. And so the UK has decided that 4chan is not allowed to exist unless it pays a bunch of money to the United Kingdom for not policing its speech in accord with uh UK laws, the numerous UK speech statutes that led to prison sentences like the one I just discussed. But there was a large fine handed down during my recent European tour against X and I believe it wasund€140 million euros, but that might be dollars. I'm

</details>

**Jason**: 针对 Elon，因为他们不同意他在英国的影响力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Elon because they disagree with his influence uh in uh the UK.

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 听着，我不能代表英国监管机构发言，但我可以做出推论。在 Elon 收购 Twitter 后，我们看到乔·拜登说：“我们必须找到对付他的办法。”我认为这种情绪可能也是共通的。但作为副国务卿，我不是某一家美国公司甚至某一种美国言论自由观点的倡导者。如果任何一家美国公司因为维护美国第一修正案而被外国势力罚款 1.4 亿美元，如果是通用汽车受到这种待遇，美国政府肯定会有所表示。我还认为 X 并不是第一家根据欧盟数字法规被罚款的公司。最近流传的一张信息图比较了欧盟通过其他指标筹集的收入与仅仅通过罚款美国科技公司筹集的收入。人们怀疑这实际上是一种**事实上的税收**，编造借口对美国大型科技公司罚款以增加财政收入。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: Look, I can't speak for the UK regulators, but I can make inferences. What's your ex X has a particular political veillance. Um we saw Joe Biden after Elon acquired Twitter saying, you know, we we've got to find ways to go after him. And I think that that sentiment might be shared. But as an under secretary of state, I'm not an advocate for one American company or even one American viewpoint on the free speech issue. If any American company were fined, let's say $140 million even by a foreign power for upholding the American first amendment, um if General Motors were treated that way, you know, the US government would have something to say about it. I also think that X is not the first company to be fined under EU digital regulations. So there's an infographic that circulated recently comparing, you know, revenues raised within the EU through other metrics and then revenues raised just by finding American tech companies. And there's a suspicion that this is really kind of a de facto tax tax and pretexts are contrived for finding large American tech companies in order to raise revenue.

</details>

**Jason**: 是的，我指的就是这个。我认为总统可能也发过类似的推文。DSA 几乎变成了一个数字“测速陷阱”，专门用来罚美国公司，而且受影响的比例极不协调，以至于你可以认为它实际上是对在欧洲运营的美国科技公司征收的**关税**。如果是这样的话，我想欧洲是被允许征收关税的，但这将改变我们设定的关税。所以，这都是更大规模贸易谈判的一部分，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Yeah. I I so that was the thing I think I was referring to is that um and I think actually the president may have um truth that out um that I think the the maybe this is more the EU but the the DSA has become almost like a digital speed trap to try and find American companies and it does massly disproportionately affect them to the point where you could argue that it's effectively like a tariff on American tech companies operating in Europe. And if that's the case, well, I mean, I guess Europe is allowed to have tariffs, but then that's going to change the tariffs that we set. So, it's all part of a larger trade negotiation,

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 没错。我以前把 DSA 称为**“审查关税”**，因为在 DSA 下维持审查机制的成本是故意征收在特定公司身上的，主要是美国公司，它们受到的监管标准比其他公司更高、更复杂。欧盟监管机构说：“那不是因为它们是美国公司，而是因为它们规模大。”但它们是美国公司而不是欧洲公司这一事实，肯定让它们在政治上更容易成为征税对象。所以很多美国人认为这是一种税。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: right? Exactly. I've referred to the DSA before as a censorship tariff because the cost of maintaining the censorship apparatus under the DSA is intentionally levied on specific companies, mostly American ones, that are that are subject to higher and more intricate regulatory standards than other companies are. And EU regulators say, "Well, that's not because they're American, that's because they're large." But the fact that they're American and not European surely makes them easier as a political proposition to tax. And so a lot of Americans see this as a tax.

</details>

### 审查的本质是保护权力

**Jason**: 真的很诡异。David，我们生活在一个言论自由在欧洲下降、在中东上升的时代。你知道，他们刚举办了利雅得喜剧节。虽然有一些规则，比如不能批评王国，不谈宗教，但你可以调侃自己人。韩国也要求你必须有社会安全号码才能在网上发帖。David，我在想你对全球这种审查趋势有什么看法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Really bizarre. David, we're seeing we're living in a time where we're seeing freedom of speech expression go down in Europe and go up in the Middle East. You know, they just had the Riad comedy festival. There were some rules. Hey, you can't criticize the kingdom. Let's leave religion off the table. But you can go after your own. But uh we we might not uh we might have some uh sensitivities there and um you know and then there's everything in between. South Korea does require you have a social security number essentially to post online. Um but David, I'm I'm wondering what you think about this overall trend in the world of what we're seeing with censorship.

</details>

**David**: 我的意思是，这不是一个好的趋势。正如我之前提到的，审查的目的总是为了保护掌权者，具体来说，是让他们免受批评。但对他们来说，听取这些批评并调整政策，比试图彻底切断反馈要好得多。在欧洲和英国非常明显，这些开放移民、大规模移民的政策非常不受欢迎。为什么不听取民众的意见并调整政策，而不是试图让他们沉默呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: I mean it's not a good trend. Um, I think that the the purpose of censorship, like I mentioned before, is always to protect the people in power and and and specifically it it insulates them from criticism, but it'd be a lot better for them to hear that criticism and adjust their policies than it would be to try and switch off the, you know, the feedback altogether. And it's very clear, I think, in Europe and the UK that these policies of open migration, mass migration are very unpopular. Why not listen to the people and adjust your policies instead of trying to silence them?

</details>

**Jason**: 随你怎么评价特朗普总统，人们有不同的看法，但《南方公园》这一季简直疯了。我是说，他们全力攻击他，程度到了我在这里都不好意思解释细节的地步。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Uh, say what you will about President Trump. Uh, and people have varying opinions, but South Park has been deranged this season. I mean, they have gone full boore in attacking him like to a level that I wouldn't feel comfortable explaining the details of it. Uh, here.

</details>

**David**: 不适合在家庭播客里说。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Not in a family podcast.

</details>

**Jason**: 不适合家庭播客。但即使……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Not in a family podcast. But but even

</details>

**David**: 特朗普总统对这些事情脸皮很厚。我们确实发生过一件奇怪的事，我想是在你任职之前，Jimmy Kimmel 和 Charlie Kirk 的那场小风波，但即使是那件事，David，特朗普总统、政府以及我们播客的老朋友 Brendan Carr 似乎都重新考虑了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: President Trump has a thick skin on these things. We did have one weird thing that occurred. I think it was before your time, the Jimmy Kimmel, Charlie Kirk Kurfluffle, but even that it seemed David um President Trump and the administration and Brendan Carr friend of the pod who's been on a couple times um kind of rethought that one. Yeah.

</details>

**Jason**: 嗯，Jimmy Kimmel 在两三个晚上内就回到了节目中。所以，那里并没有真正的政府审查。在那个案例中，是网络附属机构感到不满，因为 Jimmy Kimmel 说了些不真实、恶意且离谱的话。总之，这只是……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Well, Jimmy Kimmel was back in the air within was it like two or three nights. So yeah, I mean there's no real censorship there. In that case, it was the network affiliates who were upset because he because Jimmy Kimmel said something untrue and malicious and outrageous. So in any event, this is

</details>

**David**: 情绪激动时的产物，后来自己解决了。并没有政府审查。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: the heat of the moment with after kind of worked itself out. There was no like government censorship.

</details>

**Jason**: 在我看来，Brendan 可能不该说他说的那些话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Brendan probably shouldn't have said what he said in my estimation.

</details>

**David**: 无论如何，没有政府审查。这是底线。我认为令人不安的是，那些我们视为最亲密盟友、拥有相似价值观、属于同一西方文化和历史的国家，正朝着越来越多的审查方向发展。我很高兴看到在特朗普总统领导下，国务院正在对此进行反击。Sarah，我认为你所做的工作和 Rubio 秘书的工作极其重要。你们正在产生巨大的影响。我认为我们必须利用手中的工具，无论是贸易工具、拒绝签证还是表达谴责，来反击这种趋势。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Anyway, in any event, there was no government censorship. That's the bottom line. Um yeah, I think it is disturbing that uh countries that we see as our closest allies that share similar values that are part of the same western culture and history are moving in this direction of more and more censorship is disturbing and I'm glad to see that um under President Trump the Department of State is pushing back on this. I think Sarah the work that you're doing and Secretary Rubio extremely important. So I think you're making a huge difference. I think we have to use the tools that we have whether they're tools on trade or the denial of visas or um expressing condemnation to push back on this as we you know as we will as we can.

### AI 时代的监管挑战

**Jason**: 让我们谈谈一些新问题。**AI**。很明显，18 个月前当你看到深度伪造 (Deepfake) 时，它还无法通过“恐怖谷”。但现在的 **Grok** 图像，或者我们谷歌朋友的 Nano Banana，如果你刷得很快，你可能会搞错。在审查方面，美国对漫画家有显著的保护，法国也是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Let's talk about some of the new issues. Uh AI uh it was pretty obvious but 18 months ago when you saw a deep fake it just didn't pass the uncanny valley. uh Grock images uh Nano Banana from our friends at Google. I mean these things now if you're if you're flipping by very quickly you could make a mistake. This also uh in terms of censorship we have significant protections in the United States for say cartoonists as do the French and

</details>

**David**: 他们在嘲讽公众人物。当你在嘲讽公众人物、总统、总理、内阁成员，但公众却分不出来真假时，情况有什么不同？因为这是新事物。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: they're mocking public figures. How is it different when you're mocking public figures, uh, presidents, prime ministers, cabinet members, but the public can't tell? Cuz this is new,

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 我认为这是一个非常有趣的问题。我们有幸处于这个新的技术前沿，新的问题随之产生。我很高兴你提到了漫画家。在 **Charlie Hebdo**（查理周刊）事件发生后，我认识其中的人，我也曾在美国代理过一些关于第一修正案的案件。我看到美国人穿着 10 年前的旧 T 恤，上面写着“Je suis Charlie”。因为那是当法国的言论自由受到威胁时我们买的 T 恤，法国人站了出来。查理周刊的漫画家被炸弹袭击，被谋杀，仅仅因为说了冒犯宗教狂热分子的话。我认为，不让网上出现任何异议，是另一种形式的宗教狂热。回想那一幕，以及欧洲在言论自由上的共识自那时以来发生了怎样的转变，真的很令人清醒。但在美国，我们以身为这样一种文明而自豪：Charlie Kirk 和查理周刊都可以发声。我认为嘲笑公职人员，指出“皇帝没穿衣服”，是民主制度中最基本的事情之一。如果你相信自我治理，你就必须相信这一点。深度伪造的有趣之处在于，讽刺的重点在于你能看出那是讽刺。但如果你以一种人们无法辨别是讽刺还是非真实描绘的方式虚假地描绘公职人员，那么讽刺的张力就不存在了。然而我想说的是，每当我们达到一个新的技术前沿，总会有一种冲动去制定一连串的新法规。如果我们回顾历史上其他引起类似不稳定的前沿，比如印刷机的发明，当时人们认为那是世界末日。电报的发明，人们担心虚假信息和注意力缩短。电影胶片的发明，人们以为屏幕上的火车正向他们冲过来。克制这种冲动、允许人们去适应并给予自由以信任，这种冲动往往会随着时间的推移而得到证实。说到深度伪造，我认为在美国和欧洲都有针对诽谤的强大法律救济。如果有人创建了一个公众人物的虚假图像，且普通观众会相信该人从事了该行为，你已经可以起诉诽谤了，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: right? I think I think this is a really interesting question and it's our privilege to be at this new technological frontier where these new questions arise. U, I'm glad you mentioned cartoonists. So, after Charlie Kirk was murdered and I knew him, I represented him on some First Amendment issues in the United States. I saw Americans walking around in an old t-shirt from 10 years ago and that t-shirt said just sweet Charlie. Uh because that was a t-shirt we bought when free speech in France was under threat and French people stood up for it. The Charlie Hepto cartoonists were bombed. They were murdered. Yeah. Um for saying things that offended religious zealots. And I think you know it's a different kind of religious zealatry to not want to allow any descent online. And thinking back on that episode and how European consensus on free speech might have shifted since then is really sobering. But I think America we take pride in being the kind of civilization where Charlie Kirk and Charlie Hebdo can both speak. I think making fun of public officials. You know pointing out when the emperor has no clothes is one of the most essential things you can do in a democracy. If you believe in self-governance, you have to believe in that. And what's interesting about a deep fake is that the point of parody is that you can tell that it's parody. But if you're depicting a public official falsely in a way that people can't tell as a satirical or um non-authentic depiction, then the parody tension really isn't there. And what I would say though is whenever whenever we reach a new technological frontier, there's a temptation to just enact a flurry of new regulations. And if we look back over history at other frontiers that have caused similar instability, like the invention of the printing press, people thought that was the end of the world. The invention of the telegraph, there were worries about disinformation and attention span. The invention of the film strip, people thought the train was coming at them through the screen. The the impulse to restrain that deal, to regulate, and to allow people to adapt and to give freedom the benefit of the doubt, that impulse tends to be vindicated over time. When it comes to deep fakes, I think we have in in America and in Europe strong legal remedies against defamation. So if someone creates an image of a public figure that is false and people are believing that image and a reasonable viewer would believe that that person engaged in that action, you can already sue for defamation,

</details>

**Jason**: 没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: right?

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 这并不意味着……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: And that that doesn't mean that

</details>

**Jason**: 而且我们有儿童保护法和未成年人法。这些法律非常强大。事实是，仅仅因为你没有专门针对 AI 的法律，并不意味着你可以用 AI 做任何你想做的事，你仍然可能因为使用 AI 作为工具违法而被起诉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: and we have child protection and underage laws. Those are very strong. Yes. The thing is just because you don't have AI specific laws doesn't mean that you can do whatever you want with AI, you could still use AI as a tool to then break the law and be prosecuted.

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 我的意思是，如果你从事网络黑客攻击……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: I mean, if you engage in cyber hacking, for example,

</details>

**Jason**: 并且你使用 AI 来做这件事，你就犯了网络犯罪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: and you use AI to do it, you're guilty of of a cyber crime.

</details>

**David**: 是的。所以有很多类似的事情，现有的法律已经适用于 AI，在开始创建一堆 AI 专有法律之前，我们应该先考虑利用所有这些现有法律。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Yeah. So there's a lot of things like that where uh there are plenty of existing laws that apply to AI and we should just think about using all of those before you start then creating a bunch of AI specific.

</details>

**Jason**: 如果那些法律覆盖不了，那么也许我们需要进行深入讨论。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Yeah. those didn't cover it

</details>

**David**: 因为我正在努力想出一个边缘案例，但是……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: then there would be hey maybe we need to have a thoughtful discussion

</details>

**Jason**: 嗯，对于网络安全来说，甚至很难做到。比如使用语音克隆，那就是诈骗。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: because you know I'm trying to think of an edge case here but

</details>

**David**: 电信诈骗，你知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: um for cyber security it's even hard to do like using voice clones it's just fraud you know it's

</details>

**Jason**: 电信诈骗。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: wire fraud you know

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 可能会使用现有的诈骗法规，但你可以进行一些细微的监管调整，使诈骗更容易被检测到。一种方法（我不认为总是正确的，但它代表了一种思维方向）是，也许在某些 AI 图像上添加水印，这会减轻一些提供商的侵权责任。或者当我们大规模发明资本市场时，我们有旧的反对诈骗的法律，但我们制定了一些更精细的证券法规，比如现在你必须每年随收益报告提交某种披露。我们并没有从根本上改变处理虚假信息的方式，只是开发了一些稍微更精细的工具。但当我提到“精细”时，我认为这是一个重要的指导方针。你不能直接发疯，试图把技术创新的妖怪塞回瓶子里，特别是当我们有像中国这样的外交对手正在以激进的速度开发 AI 时。如果我们把自己包裹在安全的茧房里，我们就会在竞争中处于劣势。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: and it might be that it you use the existing fraud statute but there are little regulatory tweaks you can make the make the fraud easier to detect so one approach which I don't think is always correct but it it exemplifies one direction of thinking is maybe there's water marking or something on some AI images that would mitigate tort liability for some of the providers. Um or when we got when we when we invented capital markets on a mass scale, right? We had our old laws against fraud, but we kind of made some more fine grain securities regulations like now you have to uh file a certain disclosure annually with your earnings and whatnot. And we didn't fundamentally change how we treated false information. we just developed some slightly more fine-tuned devices. But when I say fine-tuned, I think I think that's an important piece of guidance. You don't just go crazy and try to put the technological innovation back in the bottle, especially when, you know, we have foreign policy rivals like China that are developing AI at um an aggressive pace. And if we if we cocoon ourselves in safety, we hurt our standing in that race.

</details>

### 欧美关系的未来走向

**Jason**: 那么，你认为美国和欧盟在言论自由这个话题上的关系现在走向何方？似乎存在根本性的分歧。我不清楚你正在进行的对话，但你认为这能解决吗，还是分歧会越来越大？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: So where sir, where do you think this relationship between the US and EU is now headed on this topic of free speech? I mean there does seem to be a fundamental divergence. Um do you I I don't know the conversations that you're having, but do you think this gets worked out or do you think the divide gets greater? What like where's this headed?

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 在特朗普总统和 Rubio 秘书授予我这个职位之前，我是一名诉讼律师，我的工作是战斗。现在我是一名外交官，所以我的工作是保持外交辞令。本着这种精神，我想敲响乐观之钟。我认为很多普通的欧洲人对于喜剧演员被从机场拖走感到不舒服，就像欧洲人对于出版冒犯性漫画的漫画家被谋杀感到不舒服一样。如果你看欧洲的民调，你会看到这种情绪。所以我不知道事情会走向何方，我不能承诺万灵药，但我会说我进行过富有成效的对话，并希望会有更多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: So before uh President Trump and Secretary Rubio did me the honor of this appointment, I was a litigator and it was my job to fight. And now I'm a diplomat. So it is my job to be diplomatic. And in that spirit, I would like to sound a uh gong of optimism. Yeah. I think that a lot of ordinary Europeans are not comfortable with comedians getting dragged out of the airport, just like Europeans weren't comfortable with comedians getting murdered who are publishing offensive cartoons. And if you look at polls in Europe, I think you see some of the sentiment. So, I don't know where things are going. I can't promise in a panacea, but I will say that I've had productive conversations and hope that I'll have more.

</details>

**Jason**: 我的意思是，如果情况变得更尖锐，欧洲准备好让所有的美国社交网络都被关闭并按 IP 地址屏蔽吗？因为我们真的不需要那点钱。在欧洲赚钱固然好，但也许是时候……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: I mean, if it does become more acute, is Europe prepared for all the American social networks to be turned off and blocked by IP address because we really don't need the money like these platforms. It's nice to make money in Europe, but maybe it's time

</details>

**David**: 或者各个欧洲国家会要求拥有自己的版本？比如，会不会出现一个英国专用的 X 版本？这就是事情的走向吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: or would the European or would various European countries demand their own version? You know, would there be a UK specific version of X? Is that where this would be headed

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 在某种程度上是这样。因为解决跨国问题的一种方法是**地理围栏 (Geofencing)**。但我了解到，在一些英国的执法行动中，地理围栏已经不够了，这相当荒谬。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: to an extent? because you know one way to resolve the transnational issue is geoencing. Now I think I I understand that some of the UK enforcement actions geofencing has not been enough which is pretty ridiculous but you're essentially

</details>

**Jason**: 你是说这对他们来说还不够。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: saying that's not enough for them.

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 是的。比如有一家美国小网站（我不记得名字了），英国通信管理局 (Ofcom) 起诉了它，该网站回应说：“我们已经设置了地理围栏，屏蔽了英国 IP，所以你们对我们网站上的内容应该无话可说。”但 Ofcom 仍在继续。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: Yeah. Like there's there's a there's a small American website and I can't recall the name of it that offcom has sued and that website responded well we've geoenced we've blocked UK IPs so you should have nothing to say about the content on our website but offcom is still going.

</details>

**Jason**: 是的，他们本该没事的。但那些公民选择了使用 **VPN**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Yeah, they should be good. But those people then chose their citizens chose to get a VPN.

</details>

**David**: 是的，每年花 30 美元，你就可以自己做决定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Yes, that's well that's which cost 30 bucks a year and then you can make your own decision

</details>

**Jason**: 就像伊朗人民正在做的那样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: which is what the people of Iran are doing too. So

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 但我认为你提到的通过 IP 地址屏蔽……我认为有些国家，那里的民众没有查理周刊那种传统，比如俄罗斯或中国，他们只是承认自己是审查型社会，直接屏蔽这些网站。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: um but I think I think you know you mention um like fire like blocking by IP address. I think some countries that just where the people where they don't have that Charlie Hubo tradition like countries like Russia or China they just admit that they are censurious societies and they just block these websites when you have

</details>

**Jason**: 是的。在中国我们有**防火长城 (Great Firewall)**，我们并没打算拆掉它。如果你想……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Yeah. I mean the great in China we have the great firewall which we're not trying to take down. If you want to

</details>

**David**: 但这会发生吗？英国会建立起防火长城并说：“我们要屏蔽外部世界”？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: but could that happen? Could the UK put up a great firewall and just say that you know we're black outside world.

</details>

**Jason**: 我们看穿了你们的虚张声势。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: We call your bluff.

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 我认为在技术上是可行的，到一定程度。虽然有规避方法，但在政治上是不可行的，因为英国人民渴望自由。我认为如果 Keir Starmer 说：“我们要建立防火长城，不再允许你们访问任何美国社交媒体”，他就会下台。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: I think it's technologically it's technologically feasible to a point. There are circumventions but it is not politically feasible because British people want to be free. And I think if Kier Starmer said we're putting up a great firewall and you're not allowed to access any American social media anymore, he'd be out of office.

</details>

**Jason**: 对吧？所以那是他们的权利，但他们不想那样做，因为那样做太明显了。因此……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Right? So that is their right, but they don't want to do that because it would be too obvious what they're doing. And so therefore,

</details>

**David**: 他们想通过罚款。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: they want to do the fines. They want

</details>

**Jason**: 罚款，让它看起来更隐蔽。而我们正在反击说：“不，你们不能那样做。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: to be fines and just have it be more subtle. And we're pushing back saying, "No, you can't do that."

</details>

### 审查工业复合体

**Jason**: 祝他们在 Elon 面前好运。他非常有原则。我认为他付得起那张“超速罚单”，那不会是问题。而且我要说特朗普总统，因为我确实认为特朗普总统的当选改变了美国乃至全世界言论自由的方向。因为在拜登政府期间，我们现在从“拜登诉密苏里州案”以及 Twitter 文件中披露的内容知道，拜登政府一直在向社交网络施压，要求其进行审查。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Yeah. Good luck doing that against Elon. He's pretty principal disc. I think he can pay for the speeding ticket. I don't think it's going to be a problem. And I would say President Trump because I I do think that that President Trump's election definitely changed the direction of free speech in the United States, never mind the rest of the world, because I think under the Biden administration, we now know from cases like Biden v. Missouri and then also uh you know what was released in the Twitter files and then since then even more disclosure that's come out that the Biden administration was pressuring social networks to engage in censorship.

</details>

**David**: Jason，我们讨论过这个。你可以整个 2025 年都在提拜登，但到了 2026 年，你就得……我是在回顾过去几年发生的事情，而特朗普总统改变了那个方向。

**David**: David, we did discuss this. You could bring up Biden for all of 2025, but when 2026 came around, you had to I'm recounting I'm recounting what was happening for several years and President Trump changed that direction.

**Jason**: 绝对是。

**Jason**: Absolutely.

**David**: 如果不是因为那次选举，我认为我们仍会处于审查状态。

**David**: And so if it weren't for that, I think we'd still be on a censorship.

**Jason**: 如果由扎克伯格决定，他会在卡玛拉领导下继续这么做。他在拜登领导下做得毫无压力。他是个风向标，他的整个立场都建立在什么能让系统增长的基础上。

**Jason**: If it was up to Zuckerberg, he would have continued to do it under Kamla. He did it with no problem under Biden. He's a weather vein. His entire position is based on what makes the system grow.

**David**: 听着，我认为说到这些科技公司，勇气的程度各不相同。

**David**: Look, I think when it comes to these I don't have any personal feelings on it. I think I think when it comes to the the tech companies, there's let's say a range of courage.

**Jason**: Yes.

**David**: 我会说 Elon 在愿意对抗政府以保护言论自由方面是一个异类，而其他人则更多是随风倒，政府暗示什么就做什么。虽然是“要求”，但那是错误的。政府这样做是错误的，特别是在拥有第一修正案的美国。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: And so I'd say Elon is an outlier in terms of willing to stand up Yeah. to the government in terms of protecting free speech and there's others who sort of just kind of more blow with the wind and do whatever the government is sort of um suggesting. But demanding, but it was wrong. It was wrong for the government to be doing that particularly in the US where you have a first amendment. But let me

**Jason**: 帮大家补补课：我们确实有 FBI 向我们自己的科技公司施压，说“我们不喜欢这些推文的基调，我们认为这些帖子具有破坏性”。但如果不是这样，我们永远无法查清新冠的真相，如果我们都必须接种那些神秘的、实验性的疫苗。我接种了，我没事。但那些说“嘿，也许我们不需要这个，也许不需要给孩子接种”的人，整个讨论都被拜登政府压制了。现在你让我也开始说这个了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: and to catch people up, we literally had our FBI putting pressure on our own tech companies to say we don't like the the tone of these tweets, the tone of these posts we think are damaging, but we would have never gotten to the bottom of CO and if it actually we should all be taking mysterious, you know, experimental vaccines. I took it. I'm okay. But like the folks who were saying, "Hey, maybe we don't need this. Maybe we don't need to give it to kids. They don't see that whole discussion was shut down by the Biden administration. Now you got me doing it

**Sarah Rogers**: 无可辩驳。其中一些行为的借口是“虚假信息” (Disinformation)，这个词被极度扩张了。如果你读读这些虚假信息 NGO 发布的白皮书，他们会承认：是的，信息可能是真实的，但如果它促进了我们不喜欢的“不利叙事”，我们就不喜欢它。那是多么奥威尔式的说法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: irrefutably and the the pretext for some of this was disinformation a term that was really distended to encompass and if you read the white papers put out by these disinformation NGOs they will admit yeah the information can be true but if it promotes an adverse narrative we don't like it and that's such an Orwellian adverse narative

</details>

**Jason**: 误导信息 (Misinformation)。不，不是误导信息。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: misinformation. No, not misinformation.

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 有误导信息和虚假信息。有些人的定义是：误导信息是错误的，而虚假信息是“坏的”。如果虚假信息污染了你的民主，错误的候选人可能会获胜。我认为这才是真正的冲动。但在打击虚假信息的幌子下，真实信息被压制了。事实证明那些信息是真的。被压制的信息包括：疫苗并不能完全阻止传播。事实证明这是真的。它显著减轻了传播，但不是一种绝育式疫苗。另一件被压制的事情……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: There's there's misinformation and disinformation. And the way some people defined these was misinformation is false and disinformation is bad. And if disinformation pollutes your democracy, the wrong candidate right might win. I think is really the impulse. But we had information suppressed under opaces of combating disinformation. That turned out to be true. So things that were suppressed included the assertion that the vaccine did not completely prevent transmission. That turned out to be true. It it mitigated transmission significantly, but it was not a sterilizing vaccine. Another thing that was suppressed,

**Jason**: 顺便说一句，这就是为什么很多人接种了它。他们想成为系统中的阻断者，觉得接种是我的社会义务。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: which by the way is why a lot of people took it. They didn't want they wanted to be a blocker in the system, so like it's my social obligation to do it.

</details>

**David**: 如果给了他们选择，他们可能就不会接种。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: And if had given the choice, they might not have.

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 另一件被压制的事情是关于病毒可能从实验室泄漏的评估。我们现在知道，众议院委员会和 CIA 也有同样的评估。政府认为病毒可能（虽然不确定）更有可能是从实验室泄漏的。而你却联系 Twitter、Facebook、Instagram 说：“嘿，根据第一修正案我们不能强迫你们撤下这些帖子，但如果你们撤下，我们会很感激。如果你们想留在我们的好感名单上，你们就应该撤下。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: And another thing that was suppressed that was suppressed was the assessment that the virus might have leaked from a lab. And we now know that was that was the same assessment of a House committee and the CIA. So the government thinks the virus, they're not sure, but it might have leaked from a lab more likely than not. and you're you're reaching out to Twitter, to Facebook, to Instagram saying, "Hey, you know, we can't force you to take these posts down under the First Amendment, but we'd really appreciate if you did. And if you want to stay in our good graces, you should."

</details>

**Jason**: 这是一个漫长的过程，说明我们所有人无论是在美国还是在国际上都需要保持警惕。如果你不对言论自由保持警惕，就会有人把它夺走。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Which is a long way of saying we all need to be vigilant about it in the United States, internationally. If you're not vigilant about free speech, there are people who will take it away.

### 间接审查与“去银行化”

**David**: 是的。让我问一个关于这个的问题。你提到了那些煽风点火的组织或 NGO。他们向监管机构展示案例：这个怎么样？那个怎么样？我很奇，你称之为**“审查工业复合体” (Censorship Industrial Complex)**。你能解释一下这是什么吗？你认为这些组织有些在美国，而不仅仅在欧洲？事实上，他们可能主要在美国。我在想，他们是不是把欧洲监管机构当作绕过美国第一修正案的手段？因为他们可以让欧洲监管机构审查那些在美国无法被审查的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Yes. And let me let me ask a question about that. So, you mentioned um organizations or NOS's who are kind of instigating. They're like j you know, jinning up these regulators. They're showing them cases. What about this? What about this? What about that? I'm curious, and I think you've called this a censorship industrial complex. Could you just explain what this thing is? And do you think that I know that some of these groups are in the US, not just Europe? In fact, they mostly might be in the US. And what I'm wondering is, are they going to the European regulators as an end run around the First Amendment in the US because they can get European regulators to censor material that otherwise could not be censored in the US?

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 这是一个很好的问题，但我们甚至不需要问，因为我们知道答案，答案是肯定的。我们有一些从这些 NGO 泄露出来的邮件。其中一个组织是**数字仇恨打击中心 (Center for Countering Digital Hate)**，这是一个英国 NGO，其领导人曾是我们签证制裁的目标。泄露的邮件显示，他们与美国的民主党政治家以及现在与 Keir Starmer 关系非常密切的政治家交流，说：“我们的首要任务应该是杀死 Musk 的 Twitter。”也就是杀死一家美国公司，对吧？目的是压制美国的政治言论。他们的第二优先事项是煽动英国和欧盟的监管行动。这是一个拿政府钱的实体，目的是让外国政府对付美国企业。整个模式是：这些美国 NGO 与美国政府合作，向 Twitter 和 Meta 发送强有力的（他们声称技术上非强制性的）邮件。那是这些激进分子试图复制欧盟 DSA 的一种尝试，目的是规避美国第一修正案。欧盟 DSA 要求成员国指定 NGO 为所谓的“可信标记员” (Trusted Flaggers)。这意味着这个组织的工作就是坐在 Twitter 上，寻找可能带有仇恨色彩的违规推文并报告给 Twitter。他们拥有特权报告渠道，公司被要求优先处理这些报告。如果你看看拜登领导下发生的事情，系统非常相似。政府机构会为这些报告安排优先处理渠道，而其中一些渠道中的报告技术上是由 NGO 提交的。由于新冠期间大家都在视频会议，我们还有这些 Zoom 会议的视频，政府操作人员在会上说：“根据第一修正案我们不能这样做。但幸运的是，这个参加会议的 NGO 会替我们做。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: I mean, it's a great question, but um it's a question we don't even need to ask because we know the answer, and the answer is yes. So, we have emails that have leaked from some of these NOS's. So, um one of them, the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which is a British NGO whose leader was the target of um some of our visa sanctions. There are emails exchanged with with Democratic politicians in the United States, and with politicians now very close to Kier Stormer saying um our number one priority should be to kill Musk's Twitter. So, kill an American company, right? um in order to suppress American political speech and our second priority is to instigate UK and EU regulatory action. So this is an entity taking government money to get foreign governments to come after American businesses and this whole fact pattern where these where these American NOS's were working with the American government to send kind of forceful they allege not technically coercive emails to to Twitter and Meta. um that was an attempt by these activists to replicate sort of the EU DSA in a way that would kind of dodge the American first amendment. So the EUDSA requires that member states designate NOS's as so-called trusted flaggers. Meaning this this organization its job is to sit on Twitter, look for offending tweets that might be hateful or whatever and report them to Twitter. and they get a privileged reporting channel and the company's required to give th give those reports first trunch priority. If you look at what was happening under Biden, it was a very similar system. These government agencies would arrange first trunch priority for these reports and some of what was put into those channels. The reports were technically made by NOS's. You also had you know the the upside one of the small upsides of co if you care about government transparency is everyone was holding their meetings on video. And so you have these videos of these Zoom meetings with government operatives saying, you know, we couldn't do this under the First Amendment. But fortunately, this NGO on this call with us is going to do it instead.

</details>

**Jason**: 他们有各种施压手段。这引出了我最后想问你的问题：有些公司——这实际上始于保守派阵营，后来转向了自由派——试图让广告商取消在这个节目上的投放。他们先对付自由派，然后对付保守派。但我们看到了一个更阴险的手段，人们开始说：“嘿，你是 Cloudflare，你是亚马逊，你是 PayPal，你是 Stripe。我们要去追捕你，确保我们通过羞辱或施压让你实施**‘去银行化’ (Debanking)** 和取消货币化。”YouTube 也被卷入其中，比如对你的视频进行“限流”。他们开始给 All-In 的视频贴标签，因为我们与科学家讨论了新冠。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Yeah. And they have ways of pressuring people, which leads to my final questions for you, which is there are firms that would, it actually started in the conservative space and moved to the liberal. Let's try to get advertisers to cancel on this program. They went after Howard Stern and they went after the liberals first. Then they went after the conservatives. let's get uh you know Rush Limbaugh's advertisers to cancel. Oh my god, he said these incendiary things yada yada. Um but we had a even more pernitious one which is people started to say well hey you're Cloudflare. Hey you're Amazon. Uh hey you're PayPal. Hey you're Stripe. We're going to go after you and make sure that we shame slash pressure you sometimes behind the scenes to debank and to demonetize. YouTube got pulled into this as well, like we're going to shadowban your videos. They started labeling all-in videos because we had conversations with scientists about co okay uh labeling also suppressed I think. So what are your thoughts on that which seems even more pernitious because if you take away a person's ability to monetize it, how do they scale right that?

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 美国历史上曾有一个成功的最高法院案例涉及基于观点的“去银行化”，那就是我的案子，我们赢了，叫 **NRA 诉 Vullo 案**。我们之所以能打进法院，是因为纽约金融监管机构按照诉状所述，字面上联系了金融机构说：“如果你们不与任何支持枪支的组织做生意，对你们的企业风险管理框架会更好。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: So there's been one successful Supreme Court case in US history on viewpointbased debanking and that was my case um which we won and that was called NRA versus VUO and the way we got that into court was you had you had the New York financial regulator um per the you know per the pleadings literally reaching out to financial institutions saying you know it would really be better for your enterprise risk management framework if you didn't do if you didn't do business with any proun group

</details>

**Jason**: 企业风险管理框架。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: enterprise riskmanagement framework.

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 你们都在金融界待过，你们知道这些——金融机构内部雇佣了这些官僚机构，以确保符合所有这些法规，所以他们有这些复杂的风险管理协议。这有点深入细节，但金融界有一种东西叫**“声誉风险” (Reputational Risk)**，这本应是指银行在安全性、偿付能力和稳健性方面的声誉。如果大家都认为银行会倒闭，就会发生挤兑，这对系统不利。但现在有一种 **ESG 运动**，试图扩大声誉风险的概念，使其包括：如果你允许那些调皮的、不受欢迎的发言者拥有银行账户，你的声誉就会受损。这在 NRA 案中出现了。最高法院说政府不允许这样做。尽管我们的第一修正案说国会不得制定限制言论自由的法律，这虽然不是国会立法，但它是一个政府实体不利地应用监管规定来掐断某些观点。他们不是直接去找那个说了你不喜欢的话的人，而是向这个风险厌恶的中介机构——银行——施压。去银行化和去平台化之所以阴险，正是因为这个原因。当你面对一个像金融机构这样的风险厌恶中介时……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: So you have all these professionals and you guys have you know been in finance and you know this um like these this these bureaucracies hired within financial institutions to ensure compliance with all these regulations and so they have these elaborate risk management protocols and this gets a bit into the weeds but there's this thing in finance called reputational risk and that's supposed to be the reputation of a bank for safety solveny and soundness. You don't want to run on the bank if everyone thinks the bank might fail. That's bad for the system. But there's this ESG movement to expand the concept of reputational risk to include things like do you have a reputation for letting naughty disfavored speakers have bank accounts and that came up in the NRA case. Supreme Court says government is not allowed to do that. Even though the government, you know, our first amendment says Congress shall make no law, you know, restricting the freedom of speech. This wasn't Congress making a law restricting their freedom of speech, but it was a government entity uh adversely applying regulations to choke off certain viewpoints. And they were applying it instead of going directly to the guy saying the thing you don't like, they're putting pressure on this risk averse middleman, this bank. And the the the debanking and deplatforming is insidious for exactly that reason. When you have a risk averse middleman like a financial institution,

</details>

**Jason**: 几乎就像他们故意设计成那样的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: it's almost like they designed it that way.

**Sarah Rogers**: 是的，他们在言论自由上没有切身利益。他们不像素你那样相信你的言论。他们的内部法律顾问会告诉他们，这会惹恼金融监管机构，所以撤下来更容易。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: Yeah. they they they they don't have skin in the game with respect. They don't believe in your speech the way you do. They have their in-house counsel telling them that this is going to piss off the financial regulator. So, it's easier to take it down. And my office is very

</details>

**David**: 所以，这是一个共同的主题：当政府因为违反第一修正案而不能直接做某事时，他们就利用中介去做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: So, that's a common theme is that when the government can't do it directly because it' be a violation of the first amendment, they use an intermediary to do it.

</details>

**Jason**: 所以你让银行去给某人“去银行化”，或者你找一个 NGO。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: So, you get the bank to debank someone or you get an NGO,

</details>

**David**: 黑暗 NGO。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Dark NGO,

</details>

**Jason**: 这实际上是一个政府组织，因为它是由政府资助的，但他们自称非政府。所以他们进行所谓的“事实核查”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: which is really a government organization because it's funded by the government, but they call themselves non-government. So they they do the quote unquote factchecking.

</details>

**David**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Yeah.

</details>

**Jason**: 或者在其他案例中，FBI 通过拜登政府向社交网络施压。总之，你找一个中介来干脏活，因为政府不能直接干。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: You know, or um you know, you get one of these other cases where um you know, the the this was a little bit more overt, but where the FBI through the Biden administration is then putting pressure on the social networks. In any event, you get, like you said, a middleman to do the dirty work because the government can't do it directly

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 而且是以一种非常邪恶、难以检测的方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: and to do it in a really nefarious way that's hard to detect.

</details>

### 社区笔记与 AI 的力量

**Jason**: 是的。就像“如果我们阻止了一次并购，那将是一件遗憾的事”。扎克伯格是个务实的人，我要再次抨击他。他喜欢买东西。如果 FBI 给你打电话，而你下一步还得通过联邦贸易委员会 (FTC) 的审查，你会努力表现得友好，对吧？这就是给任何监管机构对互联网拥有某种反复无常的“大棒”权力的风险——即使监管规定并非明确基于言论，只要监管者说“只有当这家伙喜欢这次并购的样子时，你才能进行并购”，那么公司就会竞相去讨好那个监管者。我认为 Jimmy Kimmel 那件事里就有一点这种成分，因为当时有一项并购正在进行中。我在电信行业的朋友告诉我，当那家公司在拜登政府期间试图出售自己时，它竭尽全力向监管机构展示自己有多么“觉醒”(Woke)。所以现在它有动力向现任政府展示它是符合 MAGA 路线的。这就是当你给监管者一根大棒时会发生的事情。现在我想说说“贴标签”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Yes. It's like it'd be a shame if we blocked a merger. Like they were very Zuckerberg's a pragmatist. I'm going to go at him again. Like he likes to buy things. And if the FBI is calling you and you've got to get something through the FTC next, you're going to try to make nice, right? And that is the risk of giving any regulator kind of a capricious cudgel over the internet is even if the even if the regulation isn't explicitly speechbased is just you can only do your merger if this guy likes likes the look of the merger then companies are going to vi to impress that regulator that I think a bit of that was going on frankly with the Jimmy Kimmel thing. um because you had this this this merger in the works, this Techno merger that they tried to complete under the Biden administration and my friends in telecom tell me that when Techno was trying to sell itself during the Biden administration, it went out of its way to show the regulator how woke it was. And so now it has an incentive to show the administration that it's magal lined and that's what happens when you give a regulator a large cudgel. Now I want to say something about labeling. So

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 给视频贴标签听起来像是“哦，这只是透明度，这能有什么错？”人们应该知道事实核查员是否认为某些事情是错误的。我认为我们办公室对此的态度是：这取决于谁贴的标签，以及出于什么目的。很多这些虚假信息 NGO 几乎就像在搞“红色恐慌”，他们会列出一份传播虚假信息的媒体名单，但他们不只是公布名单，而是发给信用卡公司、支付处理器，并暗示带有某种隐含的政府许可（因为正如 David 非常中肯地指出的，他们都是政府资助的），说：“你们真的不应该资助这些网站。”而网站永远不知道为什么，观众也永远不知道为什么。我认为一种非常好的贴标签类型是 X 上的**社区笔记 (Community Notes)**。我可以读推文，然后看到社区笔记怎么说，你可以看到社区的排名。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: labeling videos sounds oh it's just transparency. What could be wrong with that? people people should know if fact checkers think that something is wrong and I think my office's approach on that is it depends on who's putting the label on there and for what purpose so a lot of these disinformation NOS's it was almost like mart it was almost like the red scare they would make a list of outlets that were spreading disinformation but they wouldn't just publish that list they would send it around to the credit card companies the payment processors and suggest with with kind of an implicit government impromater because they're all government funded as David very very relevantly points out like you know you guys really shouldn't be funding these websites and the websites would never know why and the viewer would never know why. I think a type of labeling that's really good is the type exemplified by community notes on X where I can read the tweet and then I can see what the community notes say about it and you can see a ranking of the community total

</details>

**Jason**: 它彻底改变了游戏规则。我记得当他们在做“事实核查”时，核查结果非常糟糕，因为核查员带有偏见，或者质量控制不好。但社区笔记真的奏效了。你会看到，当有人发布真正的误导信息——比如一张假图片或一篇假文章——它总是在短时间内被抓出来，然后你会收到通知。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: it's been a total game changer. I remember when they were doing factchecking and the facteing was so bad cuz the fact checkers were biased or sometimes it just wasn't good quality control but the community note thing has like really worked and you'll see that when someone posts something that's truly misinformation like it's a fake image or a fake article or something it always gets caught amount of time and then you get notified

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 你会收到通知……你注意到了吗？如果你点赞了，它会绕回来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: you get a if you like have you noticed this if you like it'll come circle back

</details>

**Jason**: 然后它被打上了社区笔记，我收到通知，然后我觉得自己像个白痴：“哦，我被骗了。”但你知道吗？人们会因为假消息什么的抨击社交媒体，但我从来没收到过《纽约时报》犯错并在第 43 页发布更正的通知。他们从来不通知任何人，而是把更正埋在最后一页。所以我仍然认为社交媒体是目前最好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: and then it gets community noted I get a notification then I feel like an idiot that oh I got that. But you know what? People will drag social media for, you know, the fakes or whatever. But I never get notified when the New York Times makes a mistake and post a correction on page 43. They never notify anybody about that. They bury that on the last page. So I still think social media is by far the best.

</details>

**David**: 当他们在决定社区笔记时，你在会议现场吗？Elon 当时问：“跟我说说这个。”我说：“Elon，我觉得这个很有意思，你应该深入研究一下，因为它真的有效。”他看了看，立刻理解了算法，然后说：“保留这个小组，那个小组留下。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Were you in the meeting for accuracy? Were you in the meeting when they were deciding community notes or not? And Elon was like, "Tell me about it." And I was like, "Elon, I think this is really interesting. You should Yeah. double click on it because it's actually working. Um, and he looked at it, he immediately understood the algorithm and he said, "Keep the group." Yeah, that group stays.

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 你知道那个算法的天才之处在于：只有当通常持不同意见的用户都同意该说明时，社区笔记才会被推广。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: And you know what's the genius of that algorithm is the community only gets promoted if users who usually disagree agree that that notice

</details>

**Jason**: 他们在对手之间寻找共识。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: they look for consensus amongst rivals.

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: Yes.

</details>

**David**: 这是一个迷人的……我会告诉你 X 上的另一个游戏规则改变者是 Grok，因为你可以直接问 Grok：“真相是什么？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: Which is a fascinating uh the I'll tell you the other game changer um on X has been Grock cuz you can just go at Grock what's the truth? Yeah.

</details>

**Jason**: 你不一定总是同意 Grok。我不是说它完美，但它相当不错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: And you won't necessarily always agree with Guac. I'm not saying it's perfect, but it's pretty darn good.

</details>

**David**: 它正朝着正确的方向发展。我的意思是，整体上它做得非常好。是的，它在事实核查方面也做得很好。所以，我们真的不需要这些官僚、政治家和监管者来告诉我们什么是真实的。我们有社区笔记，我们现在有 AI，还有其他用户。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David**: It's trending in the right direction. It's I mean, it's really good on the whole. And yeah, I mean, it does a really good job facteing, too. So, we don't really need these bureaucrats and politicians and regulators telling us what's true or not. We have community notes. We have AI now. You've got other users

</details>

**Sarah Rogers**: 而且如果你觉得被诽谤了，你可以提起诉讼。这在美国是一个存在的概念。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Sarah Rogers**: and you can file a lawsuit if you feel you've been defamed. Like, this exists in the United States.

</details>

**Jason**: 没错。作为一个概念。听着，Sarah，我想我可以代表 USA House 的每一个人说，我们非常高兴看到你如此警惕且执着地保护第一修正案。大家为 Sarah Rogers 鼓掌！

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Exactly. As a concept. Uh, listen Sarah, we feel I think I can speak for everybody uh here in the USA House that we're really glad that you're so vigilant and dogged in protecting the First Amendment. Give it up for Sarah Rogers.
