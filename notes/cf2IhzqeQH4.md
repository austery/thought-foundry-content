title: 为什么每家AI公司都在不知不觉中建造一座银行：AI时代的金融基础设施危机
summary: Stigg联合创始人兼CEO Dor Sasson指出，当前AI公司频频遭遇的价格危机并非简单的商业模式缺陷，而是底层架构危机。传统的后计费模式无法应对自主Agent与多并发Token消耗，AI系统必须转向类似银行的实时风控架构：推理前同步预授权与锁资、执行后异步对账清算，并实现多源额度池与多层级组织预算管理。

### 定价危机的本质：商业表象之下的基础设施坍塌

在AI浪潮席卷各行各业的当下，几乎每一家AI企业都在不知不觉中构建一套类似银行的金融系统。这并非营销层面的修辞比喻，而是AI经济现实中正在发生的底层转变：我们构建、使用、消费并付费的许多AI机制，其底层运作方式已经与银行及金融结算系统高度趋同。回顾2024年4月，代码生成与模型服务平台几乎集体陷入失控边缘，短短五周内连续爆发了一连串激烈的定价危机。

这场危机的本质远非单纯的商业定价失误或财务核算漏洞，而是一场由于系统初始设计缺陷所引发的基础设施危机：
* **Anthropic** 被迫限制 **Open Claude** 及其他第三方自动化Agent通过标准订阅计划调用模型的权限，原因在于按月固定付费的订阅用户在后端产生单人每日150至750美元的高昂算力成本，导致平台无法持续承担巨额补贴。由于缺乏区分API高频调用与普通订阅会话的基础设施，官方只能采取紧急切断访问的极端措施。
* **OpenAI** 调整计费与Token消耗机制，甚至出现调用成本瞬间暴涨数倍的剧烈波动。
* **GitHub** 紧急冻结并取消了针对 **GitHub Copilot** 的免费试用计划。
* 更有未公开名称的企业因内部少数员工过度调用，在极短时间内烧光了数亿美元的云AI算力额度；**Uber** 在数周内耗尽全年的AI预算；**Replit** 同样披露了单个组织内仅三名用户就耗尽整个公司全部算力额度池的极端案例。

这些案例共同揭示了一个致命的架构共性：传统软件将**权限校验**（Entitlement Checks）放在**计费结算**（Billing）之后。系统允许用户或自主Agent无节制地调用推理、消耗Token，直到账单生成时才被动核算成本。这种后验式的对账机制导致了不可逆的成本失控与价格冲击，证明当今AI应用亟需引入银行业成熟的前置风控与金融级账务底座。

Yes, everything is fine. Okay . So, hello everyone. I heard that the match is going on right now . So the fact that you are here means a lot to me . At least I'm winning my " World Cup" now. So this, this is really significant. Thank you for joining me. I flew in from far away , I am the co- founder and CEO of Stigg. I flew here to make a rather unusual announcement at an AI conference: literally every AI company right now happens to be building a bank. And when I say "bank," I'm trying to understand it not as a weird marketing metaphor, but as what's actually happening in the AI ​​ economy right now, and why many of the constructs that we see, use, consume, and pay for actually behave like the structures we know from banking financial systems. So, cool. Thank you for inviting me. Uh, well , let's get started. By the way, I'm the first to speak today. So , the clicker doesn't work. It will be interesting to see how I move forward. Let me tell you a little bit of backstory. When I was writing this report in April, almost every code generation platform simply “broke” under the pressure of this new type of economy and new consumer behavior model. And in just , you know, about five weeks, it all looked like one continuous price crisis after another. I want to prove that these price crises go far beyond simply financial or commercial problems. These are truly infrastructure crises that arise because of how these systems were built from the start. To clarify: in April, Anthropic actually restricted access for Open Clo and other third-party agents to use subscription plans. Then, OpenAI immediately changed the pricing principles for its product, raising the price fivefold overnight, which is quite serious. And then GitHub froze, and later completely canceled trial and free access to its... There's some echo here. To your free plans for Copilot. In fact, all of these companies simultaneously experienced in one month what it means to sell AI at scale and what really happens when you don't have a solid foundation. So let me take one more step forward. So, let's take a closer look at at least one of the use cases, shall we? If you think about Anthropic and remember the case with Open Claude, right? What actually happened was that Anthropic subsidized every consumption of every user who used Open Claude as part of a Claude Pro subscription. So, essentially, customers paid every day, you know , dollars and cents. But on the cost side for Anthropic, it was anywhere from $150 to even $750 in subsidies, which is essentially an economy that can't scale even for a company of the caliber and scale of Anthropic, right? So what seemed like a business problem was actually an infrastructure problem, as Anthropic had no effective way to differentiate between users using their API and users using their subscription programs. And so they had to immediately stop and close access, right? They had to react. Um, okay. So, and this doesn't just apply to Anthropic, guys. We see this, I don't know if you've heard the recent news about how one company, whose name will not be disclosed, burned through half a billion of its cloud AI credits just by letting a few employees use up the entire corporate contract. We had Uber announce that it had effectively burned through its entire annual budget on AI consumption in just a few weeks. And then there was Replit, who gave an example of what can happen if, in one organization, just three users actually spend the entire credit pool for the entire company. So what's really happening is this: it's not just an Anthropic problem. And I think the common thread, if we switch from the examples to what's actually happening, is that the problem in all three of these examples is that the checks of what you're entitled to, what you're allowed to do, whether you're an agent or a user of our AI product, happened after the billing, not before. So essentially, in each of these examples, you were allowed to consume, you were allowed to use the product, you were allowed to spend tokens, and the checks were only made after the bill was issued. So, essentially, costs and their consequences are only reconciled when it's too late, only after the invoice has been sent , and this actually hurts the business, causes price shock, and is a bad practice for using these systems. These systems are now critical, and essentially none of these companies had the financial infrastructure that would allow, like banks, friends, to check before we withdraw funds, before we consume, right? So, I think what we're seeing is really a change in how we design, deliver, and build software. AI doesn't just change the concept of value, it doesn't just change how we interact and who the users are. It also actually changes what exactly is being paid for, and how we actually design systems that can handle the turnaround time, the complexity of use to billing, to audits, and how we can actually design that.

### 从后验账单到同步锁资：重构AI执行热路径

在传统SaaS模式中，验证与核算大多发生在推理结束与用量记录之后，这种滞后性在面对Token的高速、非线性消耗时彻底失效，直接导致算力暴走、成本失控以及毛利率被吞噬。因此，AI系统的软件设计哲学必须发生范式转移：在关键请求路径上建立**同步预授权**与**锁资机制**，而在执行完成后进行**异步对账与清算**。

这与现实中的自动取款机（ATM）逻辑完全一致：当持卡人取现时，银行系统绝不会在钞票吐出后再去核对账户余额是否充足，而是在吐钞指令触发前以毫秒级完成同步冻结与校验。在AI场景中，这意味着：
1. **热路径同步评估**：在模型推理请求发起的瞬间，系统必须同步拦截，判定当前用户、API凭证或自主Agent是否具备访问特定功能的权限、套餐配额限制、以及是否存在有效资金池。
2. **决策级联与确定性规则**：针对多种使用限制、促销额度及阶梯策略，运行时必须通过确定性的决策流计算优先级，即时决定是否放行请求并预扣额度。
3. **系统定位认知升级**：这套架构不仅是狭义的**计费引擎**（Billing Engine），而是一个在任何账单与支付动作发生前独立运转的**运行时金融风控系统**（Runtime Financial System）。

这一架构路径与 **OpenAI** 内部的“金融工程”（Financial Engineering）团队在2024年2月公开的技术实践高度吻合。面对千万级规模的并发请求，OpenAI构建了极度类似于银行交易核心的决策级联架构，将授权判断与实际结算彻底解耦。

So I think what's interesting, and what you see in front of you, is that on the left we see most teams shipping this architecture today ; and you can see that, in essence, the verification and calculations happen after, after the inference, after the usage has been registered. And usually it's already too late. We see situations like cost spikes, cost overruns, overconsumption —this is an experience that is bad for business, bad for your users, and frankly, in many cases, bad for the provider as well . Because if you haven't allocated enough resources and computing power to allow for that, you also potentially have a margin problem, right? On the right, we're actually saying, or I'm trying to prove to you all, that with AI, with the current infrastructure and the way AI is built and sold, we actually need to implement it synchronously before we update the balance sheets, and reconcile and settle asynchronously after the consequences occur. So, the hot path is actually checked synchronously, and everything that comes after is, in fact, checked later. I think the best example, friends, is if you imagine you're going to an ATM, right? And you withdraw cash . When you withdraw cash, the check to see if you are allowed to withdraw it does not happen after you have received the cash. It happens before you withdraw cash. And it's exactly the same. Our industry actually lacks that level, that financial infrastructure that allows this type of behavior to happen naturally, right? And so, obviously, this sounds like a great idea, right? It seems like you're promoting this infrastructure as if you have some connection to it . Um, but guys, it's not just my fault. In February OpenAI, they have a great team that they call financial engineering. And these guys actually published their vision of the architecture and what they had to build to make it work at OpenAI scale. And what they told me is very similar to the way banks' transaction systems work . Essentially, you have a decision cascade that must take into account at runtime what the client, user, or agent is allowed to do. And he has to take into account a lot of different conditions and policies about what is actually allowed, right? So, are you allowed or do you have access to a certain feature or product? What are the limitations on your plan? Are you on a trial period or in a specific promotional program? You need all of these decisions to be calculated instantly at runtime. And then finally decide: can I give this user access? Can they write off the funds? Can they consume the resource or not? And all of these decisions can't really happen after the bill is issued. They can't, because you need to actually be able to calculate and prioritize this . So I think we have to point out three things here, right? Firstly, this is a single synchronous assessment. This happens during the query. This does not happen after the fact. I think the second thing is that priority is deterministic. So, we know in advance all the different rules that apply to consuming certain things, right? And finally, I think, and here, guys, this is my subjective opinion, you may disagree. I don't think this is billing. I don't think this whole architecture is necessarily just about the idea of billing and payment. This is a financial system that actually makes decisions before any bill, before any payment element. And I think we'll see this increasingly become the standard for other products and other AI systems.

### 高并发博弈：双重支付、资金暂留与多源额度池

将AI基础设施推向金融级严密性的另一大核心推手，是**并发访问**（Concurrent Access）与**多源额度核算**问题。在银行体系中，如果两个账户持有者同时尝试从仅剩10美元的共享账户中取现，系统依靠底层的**资金保留与结算**（Hold & Settle）机制防止超额透支；然而在当今的AI系统中，并发控制的漏洞屡见不鲜：

* **并发代理与双重支付危机**：当数以万计的并发Agent同时请求访问同一个企业资金池时，若系统仅依赖普通的数据库读写检查，每个Agent在请求瞬间都会看到充足的余额，进而引发并发超扣。这种会计学上经典的**双重支付问题**（Double-Spending Problem），必须通过引入**复式记账法**（Double-Entry Bookkeeping）、预留暂留机制、幂等性保障（Idempotency）以及全链路审计日志来从根源上解决。
* **单体整型字段的局限性**：绝大多数开发团队初期仅在数据库中设计一个简单的整数列（如 `credits: 1700`）来记录剩余额度。但在真实商业环境中，这些额度来源于截然不同的资产池：部分是按月赠送的促销配额，部分是按需采购的高价值积分，部分附带特定过期时间。
* **多源扣减策略**：系统必须具备类似银行区分储蓄账户、支票账户与信用额度的扣款路由逻辑。先扣减哪一部分？优先消耗即将过期的赠送额度，还是锁定合同预付额度？依赖单一整型数字的简陋数据库模型完全无法承载这种多维度资产管理需求。

I'll go into a little more detail...sorry, I missed one slide. So, yeah, I'll dig a little deeper into what other features or elements we see in banks that we're used to and take for granted, but in AI they're not as obvious, in software they're not as obvious. Here's just one example, okay? If two separate parties have access to the same bank account , and there is, say, $10 in that account, and they have the right to withdraw that $10. What happens if they both try to withdraw funds at the same time? So , in banking systems there is the concept of retention and settlement. In banks, the problem of simultaneous access has actually been solved, but with AI and agents, this is not the case. You might have, say, 10,000 agents trying to tap into the same pool of funds at the same time, and superficially it seems like they should be able to withdraw money because there is a balance in the account. But what happens when they all withdraw funds from the same pool at the same time? Concurrent access becomes a problem. So how to solve this? This concept in financial systems is known as the classic double- spending problem. She comes from the world of accounting. This is a double entry method. And as I'm sure you're all building and implementing AI solutions today, as your revenue grows and your company scales, the ideas of double-entry bookkeeping , double- billing, and solving concurrent access problems will become important and not be easy to solve later. So think about things like implementing retention and calculation mechanisms, think about idempotence and auditability of these queries, and so on. Another thing that I think is well known in banking systems , but not well established in AI, is the idea that all the different pools have different sources, right? At the bank, you have a debit account, a cash account, a savings account, right? And if you withdraw funds, the bank actually knows how to calculate which account the debit is coming from and what it means. Here, let's say I have a pool of 1,700 credits, but they are not the same, they are different. Each of them comes from a different source. So how do you decide which pool to withdraw funds from? Do you start with the ones that were provided earlier? Do you start with the ones that were on sale? How do you actually calculate what exactly is being charged to users? I think this is a real problem. Most companies today are trying to solve this with single integer databases, and that won't work in the long run. Hmm, cool.

### 企业级拓扑与四大复用模式：AI销售的“Stripe时刻”

过去企业软件的消费拓扑极其扁平，层级结构基本局限于“用户”与“租户组织”两个维度，价值归属与用量责任一目了然。但在AI工作负载下，企业级采购往往涉及七位数的预付费合同，企业管理层不仅要求在合同期内消耗额度，更需要穿透至不同业务线、工程团队、终端用户以及特定的自主Agent群组。这种高基数、多维度的消费监控，要求底层支持细粒度的层级配额、动态预算划分与开销熔断限制。

当AI公司开始规模化交付产品时，沉淀出了四个不可逆的核心架构模式：
1. **预占资源与后验结算**：在模型开始生成流式输出前进行资源预留，任务完成后依据实际Token与硬件耗时异步校准账目。
2. **私有VPC内嵌账务与审计**：出于超低延迟、网络成本以及**数据主权**（Data Sovereignty）的严格合规要求，越来越多的头部企业拒绝将原始事件与计费追踪推送到第三方公有云，而是要求将用量账簿与计量注册表私有化部署在企业自身的虚拟私有云（VPC）内。
3. **不可预测工作流的动态余额巡检**：自主Agent在接管多步骤复杂任务时，其执行步数、模型调用次数以及最终总成本在初始阶段是完全未知的。系统必须支持在任务流转过程中持续动态核验余额，动态追加锁资，并在任务执行完毕后完成精确清算。
4. **穿透式财务能见度**：支持CFO与CTO按底层模型类型、功能模块、用户层级实时拆解AI工作负载消耗，已从传统的报表附加功能转变为企业采购的硬性合规门槛。

OpenAI在4月份针对计费的隐蔽调整即是这一逻辑的典型体现：平台并未上调公开单价，而是直接改变了特定操作的Token消耗速率，由于底层消耗速度的变化，实质上等同于一次全量价格重构。这进一步证实，AI时代的定价早已不是财务电子表格里的公式变动，而是深嵌在代码与基础设施当中的运行时行为。

当前的AI基础设施生态，正处于类似2010年代初期的**“Stripe时刻”**：彼时互联网商务蓬勃兴起，各家公司迫切需要安全、便捷且标准化的在线支付结账体验，Stripe应运而生并定义了时代；而如今，AI企业正面临同样的基础设施断层——除非创始人热衷于亲自穿上西装去手工建造一家复杂且充满合规风险的银行，否则整个行业急需开箱即用的专业金融级计量结算基础设施，将工程师从繁重的账务管道开发中解放出来。

So, to sum it up , I think if you think about how we interact with software, it used to be pretty simple. Before, there were just users and organizations, and there was nothing substantial between them, right? The software consumption hierarchy was quite flat. It was pretty clear who exactly was getting the value. But today, I believe, credit pools are no longer flat. You have many different hierarchies of credit consumption that also require different management, logic, allocation, budgets, and spending limits. What actually happens is that budgets are set from the top, for example, if you sell to corporations, maybe a one-year contract with a prepayment, management or someone else has approved this seven-figure contract, they expect to see those credits spent over the life of the contract. But they want to see more than just being used. They want to know who exactly used them, which team, which users, which agents, to what extent, and they want to have granular control over that. This is literally the foundation of how more and more companies are thinking about selling AI workloads and how they work effectively in production. I'm going to go over this briefly. I think the idea of ​​ what high- cardinality and dimensional graphs are, the ability to analyze data by model types, by users, this whole dimension of consumption—it's probably an interesting topic to discuss. But I really want to go into more detail about these four patterns. So when you build AI and start selling it at scale, there are four patterns that keep recurring, and they're very similar to the idea of banking systems. I think the first one, which we talked about earlier, is the ability to reserve resources before output and make calculations based on usage. This is a pattern we're seeing more and more often, and it affects how you do accounting, how you handle all these different workloads, concurrency, and so on. Second, we see that more and more AI companies are not thrilled about the idea of ​​ sending all this usage data somewhere in the cloud. For reasons of latency, cost, data sovereignty, there are many good reasons why these companies prefer to store event data in their VPC, and I think we'll see more and more companies seriously consider deploying this architecture, this registry and accounting system inside their VPC, instead of transmitting it over the internet. I think, in terms of agent checks, consider how agents are created: the idea of checking balances, where the agent does something and you don't know in advance what exactly they're going to do and how much that task is going to cost in the end . So, if you don't know the value, you need to be able to check those balances while the agent continues to work. And you need to be able to reserve funds for them in advance and then asynchronously reconcile them after execution. Moving on, ultimately, if you have systems like these, you get transparency. It used to be taken for granted that pay-per-use products required transparency, but I think today it goes far beyond mere visibility. This means that the ability for a CFO or CTO to actually see the consumption of AI workloads across different models, functions, and products is no longer just a nice addition. This becomes a basic requirement. It's becoming something that's impossible to do business without, and we'll see more and more companies expect it right away before they start working with you . And by giving examples of how the best cutting-edge AI companies are approaching this, I think you can already see these patterns. So, I think a lot of these companies are already realizing that you're no longer selling software as a commodity, the way we used to think about subscriptions and usage. This is increasingly turning into financial systems, and they require complex ideas that did not exist before the AI ​​ era. Um, and I think it's worth giving one small example that I mentioned earlier, but which may have gone a little unnoticed. Hmm . One of the changes that OpenAI introduced in April was that they didn't actually change the prices. All they did was change the rate at which tokens are spent . So, essentially, you're using the same model, we're paying the same cost per unit, but burning more tokens. So, it was actually a pricing change. How to make such a change? Um, because it's not just a financial change, it's an infrastructure change. You are essentially changing the speed of software consumption. So there are a lot of complexities not just in how we change prices, but also in how the infrastructure allows for more complex ideas about how value is delivered to users. And actually, before we wrap up, our team likes to say—and we've started saying this more often than before— that it feels like the same thing now as it did in the early 2010s, this "Stripe moment," when every company wanted to put products online, and you needed a checkout, it had to be secure, and developers needed everything to work quickly and easily. I think we're at a point now where ideas like building banks... well, if you like wearing a suit and tie, maybe you want to build a bank, but if you do, you should be aware of all the features and elements that need to be there so you don't run into them later when it's much harder to fix. So it feels like the industry is really missing its “ Stripe moment,” where all these structures just exist and are very easy to use. And you know, our team is very inspired by the potential of creating these ready-made systems that will help AI companies continue to release products. If you were interested, be sure to visit our stand. We are in a rather strange place, right at the very beginning, but we are there. I know there's a game going on right now. Come visit. We are holding a product demonstration. Feel free to ask questions, and thank you for coming today. It was wonderful to spend this time with you. And yes, we will be happy to continue discussing the details at our stand.
