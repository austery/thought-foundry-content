title: 每个人都需要助理：为什么授权和杠杆是成功的关键
---

### 时间：终极资产与个人杠杆

关于布莱恩·约翰逊（Brian Johnson）想要打破生物学的束缚，而我（嘉宾）想要打破时间的束缚。我们总能再筹集一轮资金或再做一笔交易，但我们无法再争取一个十年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Brian Johnson wants to break the chains of biology. I want to break the chains of time. We can always raise another round or do another trade, but you can't raise another decade.</p>
</details>

你经营着一家大型公司，同时还做投资，还是一个拥有四个孩子的幸福婚姻的丈夫。我知道你做到这一切的方式是**授权（Delegation: 将任务和责任分配给他人或系统来完成）**。你总结出的秘诀是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You're running a massive company. You also do investing. You're also a happy marriage with four kids. I know the way that you do it all is delegation. What is the secret that you've figured out?</p>
</details>

授权的**首要大忌（Cardinal sin of delegation）**是认为“自己做会更快或更好”。而它之所以成为一个障碍，是因为这是事实。但获得**杠杆（Leverage: 投入少量资源，产出巨大回报的能力）**的唯一方法就是经历这个付出的过程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Cardinal sin of delegation is that it will be faster or better to do it myself. And the reason it's a blocker is cuz it's true. But the only way you get leverage is by going through that work.</p>
</details>

几十年前，你必须像马克·安德森（Mark Andreessen）或彼得·蒂尔（Peter Thiel）那样的人物，才能拥有六个助理，这要花费你五十万美元。现在，通过像 Athena 这样的公司，每月只需 3000 美元，你就可以拥有自己的助理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A couple decades ago, you had to be Mark Andreessen or Peter Thiel to have a half dozen assistants and that cost you half a million dollars. Now with a company like Athena for 3,000 bucks a month, you can have your own assistant.</p>
</details>

### 创始人经历与助理的起源

你在你丰富的创始人职业生涯中学到了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What have you learned in your extensive founder career?</p>
</details>

乔纳森，欢迎来到播客。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jonathan, welcome to the podcast.</p>
</details>

谢谢你的邀请。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thanks for having me.</p>
</details>

所以乔纳森，你经营着一家拥有 4000 名员工的庞大公司。你也做投资。你也有一个幸福的家庭，有四个孩子。你如何做到这一切？我知道你的方式是授权。你有首席**幕僚长（Chief of Staff: 负责战略协调和高层决策支持的高级职位）**，还有一堆**行政助理（EA: Executive Assistant，通常负责行政和日程管理）**。你能不能谈谈你发现的、其他人可以学习的秘诀是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Jonathan, you're running a massive company. What 4,000 employees? 4,000 employees. You also do investing. You're also in a, you know, happy marriage with with four kids. How do you do it all? I know the way that you do it all is delegation. You have a chief of staff, a bunch of EAs. Why don't you talk about what is the secret that you've figured out that other people can learn from?</p>
</details>

是的。我的起源故事是这样的：毕业后，我在白宫工作，坐在**西翼（West Wing: 白宫西翼，美国总统行政办公室所在地）**，紧挨着总统的行政助理们。正如你所料，西翼的 EAs 非常出色。这为我设定了关于 EA 客户伙伴关系可以达到何种高度的极高标准。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, my origin story here is out of school, I worked at the White House and uh I sat I sat in the West Wing next to the president's executive assistants. And as you might imagine, the EAs in the West Wing were really freaking good. And it set my bar super high for what this EA client partnership could look like.</p>
</details>

当我搬到旧金山创办 Thumbtac 时，我说：“好吧，我不是总统，但如果我有一个和总统级别一样好的 EA 和支持团队，我能完成什么？”所以在 Thumbtac，在我们扩大业务规模时，我雇佣了我在菲律宾的第一位助理，她开始帮我处理基本事务，比如收件箱、日程表，然后我们就变得有创意，做了越来越多复杂、有趣的事情，我们可以稍后讨论。我发现，我获得的杠杆越多，我的抱负就越大，这种效应不断复合。你从一个助理开始，现在我有六个助理，每个助理都给了我更多的杠杆来承担更多的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when I moved to San Francisco to start a Thumbtac, I said, "Okay, I'm not president, but what if I had a EA and support team that was as good as the presence? Like, what could I accomplish?" And so at Thumbtac, as we were scaling the business, I hired my first assistant in the Philippines started helping me with basic stuff, inbox, calendar, uh, and then we just got creative and we did more and more complex, interesting things, which we can talk about. And what I found was the more leverage I got, the more ambition I got and it just compounded. And, you know, you started with one assistant, now I've got a half dozen and every assistant gives me more leverage to take on more things.</p>
</details>

这很有趣，因为有些人会说：“嘿，你知道，比尔·盖茨比我富有得多，但他拥有和我一样的手机。”或者我记得也许是你，也许是别人说过：“等等，奥巴马应该有，你知道的，或者总统应该有比我好得多的信息，但他们读的媒体和我们一样。”这也是一个例子，那就是**民主化（Democratization）**：白宫拥有惊人的协助，但多亏了 Athena，你知道，还有技术，在某个时候，每个人都会拥有某种程度的优势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's fascinating because I some people say, "Hey, you know, Bill Gates is so much richer than me, but he has the same phone that I have." Or I remember um maybe it was you, maybe someone else who was like, "Wait, Obama should have, you know, or the president should have way better information than me, and yet they're like reading political like they're reading the same media." And this is like another example of it, which is the democratization where White House have amazing assistance, but thanks to Athena, you know, and and you know, technology, at some point, everyone will have a certain block.</p>
</details>

### 授权的层级与 AI 的角色

确实如此。几十年前，你必须是马克·安德森或彼得·蒂尔那样的人，才能拥有六个助理，花费五十万美元。现在，有了像 Athena 这样的公司，每月 3000 美元，你就可以拥有自己的助理。然后有了 AI，是的，它将变得无处不在。将有数十亿人学习向机器助理**委托（Delegate）**，随着你的预算增加，你可能会增加一个人类助理或首席幕僚长，但这只是一个杠杆阶梯。我们应该如何思考人类能做什么，而 AI 能做什么？你还记得我朋友十年前创办 CL，基本上是想成为 AI 助理。这显然是在很多创新发生之前。那么，如何正确看待这种人与 AI 的关系呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Exactly. that you know a couple decades ago you had to be Mark Andreessen or Peter Thiel to have a half dozen assistants and that cost you half a million dollars. Now with a company like Athena for 3,000 bucks a month you can have your own assistant and then with AI yeah it's going to become ubiquitous. People are there's going to be billions of people learning to delegate to a machine assistant and as your budget increases you might add a human or a chief of staff on top but it's just kind of a ladder of leverage. How should we think about what are the things that humans can do versus what are the things that AI can do? You know, remember my friend started CL um you know a decade ago which is trying to be AI assistance effectively. Obviously this is well before a lot of the innovation but what is the right way of thinking about sort of the human AI you know relationship.</p>
</details>

是的。我想这是一个不断变化的目标，它会变得越来越有能力。我们的观点是，这就像自动驾驶汽车，它不会一夜之间实现自动驾驶。一开始你驾驶特斯拉，然后有辅助转向和制动，然后随着时间的推移，它变得更加自主。助理也会发生同样的事情。我对创始人的看法是，如果你没有助理，你就是那个助理，而你不想成为助理。所以，无论你的预算是多少，你都应该首先开始学习授权。如果你每月只有 20 美元，你就从向 ChatGPT 授权开始。**提示工程（Prompt engineering）**实际上就是授权。如果你擅长利用 ChatGPT 来集思广益你的目标，弄清楚如何才能在业务上迈出下一步，一旦你有预算雇佣人类助理或首席幕僚长，你就为迈向下一个层次做好了准备。所以你从每月 20 美元开始。如果你有预算，你就雇佣一个像 Athena 这样的服务直接为你工作的人。如果你有足够的钱，你就雇佣一个现场的人。那是一笔六位数的开销。如果你拥有传奇般的预算，那么你就会有一群助理和首席幕僚长跟在你身边。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah I mean it's a moving target obviously is going to get increasingly more capable and our view is it's like self-driving cars where it's not self-driving overnight. It's you drive the Tesla at first and then there's assisted steering and braking and then over time it becomes more autonomous. And the same thing is going to happen with assistants. My my view here for founders is if you don't have an assistant, you are the assistant and you don't want to be the assistant. And so no matter your budget, you should first start by learning to delegate. Uh and if you only got 20 bucks a month, you start by delegating to chat GPT. And prompt engineering is really just delegating. And if you become world class at leveraging Chat GPT to brainstorm your goals, figure out how uh you can take the next step in the business, once you have the budget for a human assistant or chief of staff, then you're prepared to go that next level. So you start 20 bucks a month. Um if you have budget, then you hire someone direct with a service like Athena. If you have enough money, you hire someone in person. That's six figures, you know. And if you're uh legendary budget, then you've got a suite of assistants and chief of staff following you around. Yeah.</p>
</details>

### 缩小差距：非显而易见的授权领域

所以，我多年来一直有一个助理，她非常出色。我用她来安排日程和处理典型的助理事务。但你有很多助理。我们那位朋友萨姆·科科斯（Sam Corkos）也有很多助理。缩小那些做得好的人（比如你）与其他人之间的差距，他们还把哪些事情授权出去了，而这些事情可能并不明显呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I've had an for many years now and and she's absolutely amazing and um you know I use her for scheduling and u you know typical assistant activities but you have many assistants you know our friend Sam Corkos has a bunch of assistants as well close the gap between what do the people who do it well like you know what else do people get leverage on or delegate that maybe is not obvious.</p>
</details>

首先，你开始从你的生活中消除痛苦。所以，我从不等人接电话。我从不在网上输入我的信用卡信息。我永远不会填写 DMV 表格，永远不会办理护照续期。世界上充满了所有这些令人烦恼的事情。所以首先，你要消除那些消耗你、不给你带来杠杆的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So first you start by taking the pain off of your life. So you I never wait on hold. I never put my credit card in the internet. I would never fill out DMV forms, never do passport renewal. The world is full of all these annoyances.</p>
</details>

一旦你做完了这些，下一步就是提高你的眼界，你会想：“我能开始什么新业务？我如何才能更快地扩大我的业务？我如何才能花更多时间陪伴家人？我真正想多做哪些事情？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so first you take off these things that drain you that don't give you leverage. Then once you've done that, then the next thing is you raise your sights and you're like, what's a new business I could start? How can I scale my business faster? Uh how can I spend more time with my family? What are the things uh I actually care to do a lot more of? Yeah.</p>
</details>

我从基本事务开始，比如收件箱、日程表，这是每个人都会做的事情，然后我开始试验。在 Thumbtac 扩张的日子里，当我们整天都在一个房子里工作时，我告诉我的助理 Marne：“我工作之外几乎没有朋友。我知道的唯一的人都在这个大楼里。我需要交一些朋友。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and so I start with basic stuff, inbox, calendar, stuff that everyone does, but then I just start experimenting. And so, you know, during the scaleup days of Thumbtac, when we're in a house working all the time, I told Marne, my assistant, I don't really have any friends outside of work. I was like, the only people I know are in this building. I need to make some friends.</p>
</details>

所以我告诉她，让我们每隔一周在我家举办一次创始人晚宴。我们过去经常一起做很多这样的事情。这就是我结交所有最好朋友的方式。我下班后走回家，Marne 已经邀请了人，安排好了厨师和调酒师，我们走进门，结交新朋友，你知道我就是这样认识我的妻子凯瑟琳的。然后 Marty 帮我计划婚礼，现在 Mary 帮我们照顾孩子。所以你知道，它从小处开始，然后你不断地复合这些事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, I told her, let's plan a a founder dinner at my house every other week. And we did lots of this together back in the day. And that's how I made all my best friends. And I just walked home from work and Marne had invited people, set up the the chef and the bartender and we walk in and we make new friends and you know I met Catherine, my wife through that and then Marty's helping plan our wedding and now Mary helps us with our kids and so you know it starts small and then you just kind of compound these things.</p>
</details>

### 算法式授权：超越任务分配

是的。但在那个例子中，你能多谈谈她是**如何知道**该联系谁，或者具体是怎么做的吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. But even in that example um like say more about how did she know who to reach out to or what kind of Yeah.</p>
</details>

是的。入门级的**授权（Delegation）**是按任务授权。你说：“帮我计划这个晚宴。”如果你只说这些，你不会得到你想要的。更高级的授权方式称为**算法式授权（delegate by algorithm）**，即你实际上将自己的内部偏好导出，作为授权的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So the kind of entrylevel delegation is you delegate by task. you say, "Help me plan this dinner party." If you just say that, you're not going to get what you want. Um, the more advanced way to delegate is called delegate by algorithm, where you actually export your own internal preferences as you delegate.</p>
</details>

所以我会说：“嘿，当我计划晚宴时，我喜欢有六到八个人。我喜欢那些筹集了相似资本或处于相似阶段或拥有相似员工数量的人。”然后你为如何找到合适的人写下一个算法。然后你得到关于它是否有效的反馈。一旦算法完全从你的脑海中导出，剩下的就是重复操作。所以你知道，工程师倾向于更擅长创建这种**标准操作程序（SOPs: Standard Operating Procedures，标准实践）**，但这是你可以学习做的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I would say, "Hey, when I plan dinner parties, I like to have six to eight people. I like people to have raised similar amounts of capital or be at similar stages or similar number of employees." And literally write an algorithm for how you find the right people. Um and then you get feedback on whether it worked or not. And once the algorithm is fully exported from your head, then it's just rinse and repeat. And so you know engineers tend to be better at creating these kind of like SOPs or standard practices. But it's something yeah you can learn to do.</p>
</details>

### 助理的专业化与首席幕僚长

你能多分享一些关于如何为拥有多个助理的人进行区分，或者如何跨团队进行授权吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And so share more about what how you for people have multiple systems or how do you differentiate like how do you you know sort of delegate across the team?</p>
</details>

是的。我从一个助理开始，然后像任何团队一样，你会专业化。我只有一个助理，她做所有事情，像一个通才，现在我有六个——我知道这听起来很疯狂——但每个助理都专注于不同的事情。一个负责工作，一个负责家庭，一个负责孩子、家庭、旅行、财务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah, I mean start with one uh and then like any team you specialize and so I just had one that did everything as a generalist and now half dozen which I know sounds crazy but each one specialized in different things. One is on work, one is on home, one is on kids, family, travel, uh finances.</p>
</details>

这种专业化很有帮助，因为财务助理只关注资产负债表、汇款、所有这类事情。然后我有一个首席幕僚长，他坐在顶层，负责将工作分配给所有其他人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and uh that specialization is helpful because the finance person is just thinking about balance sheet, uh you know, sending wires, all of that sort of stuff. And then I have a chief of staff who sits on top who distributes work across all of them.</p>
</details>

### 授权的两大原则

还有哪些原则或框架对于最大限度地利用助理来说非常重要或不那么明显？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What are other principles like, you know, I love this delegate by algorithm, not not by task. What are other principles or frameworks that are really important or non-obvious to, you know, get the most out of an assistant?</p>
</details>

授权的首要大忌是“自己做会更快或更好”。这是大多数人的第一大障碍。而它之所以成为障碍，是因为这是事实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, the the cardinal sin of delegation is that it will be faster or better to do it myself. That's the number one blocker for most people. And the reason it's a blocker is cuz it's true.</p>
</details>

如果你自己做，第一次确实会更快或更好。授权和教别人做需要更多的努力。它可能没有你希望的那么快或那么好，但获得杠杆的唯一方法就是经历这个过程。所以你必须克服这种启动能量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It will actually be faster or better if you do it yourself that first time. And it takes more effort to delegate to teach someone how to do it. It might not be as fast or as good as you'd like it, but the only way you get leverage is by going through that work. So, you have to overcome that activation energy.</p>
</details>

第二个错误是人们没有为长期考虑，他们雇佣了一个助理，然后在每 6 到 12 个月更换一次。但正是这种复合效应创造了巨大的杠杆。我和 Marne 合作了十年，她现在就像我的小妹妹一样，她了解我的一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The second mistake people make is they don't compound for the long term and they hire someone and then switch an assistant every 6 12 months. But it's the compounding that creates incredible leverage. I've been working with Marne for a decade, like a little sister now, and she knows everything about me.</p>
</details>

这是共同的原则。在授权方式上，我认为最常见的方式是用手机上的拇指操作，这是最糟糕的方式，非常慢。用电脑上的十根手指操作会更好，但这实际上也相当慢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that's just kind of like common principles. Um, in terms of the way to delegate, I think the this is just tactical the methods. You know, the most common way people delegate is with your thumbs on your phone. That's the worst way. Very slow.</p>
</details>

最好的授权方式是使用你的声音。你可以用声音说话的速度快两到三倍。你可以在旅途中完成，可以在午餐和 Uber 之间完成。在 Thumbtac 经历超速增长的时期，我会在会议之间走动，在一次会议结束后，我会通过语音记录告诉助理：“这是要点，预先起草这五封邮件，跟进这个人。”到我开始下一次会议时，这次会议的所有工作实际上都已经委托出去了，而不是所有事情都堆积起来，到了晚上你就说：“我有 100 件事要做。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, better to use all 10 fingers at a computer, but that's actually pretty slow as well. The best way to really delegate is using your voice. And so voice, you can talk two to three times faster. You can do it on the go. You can do it on a date between lunch, you know, in the Uber. Um, you know, at Thumbtac during hyperscale times, I would walk between meetings and between a meeting, I would be voice noting to an assistant, here's the takeaways, pre-draft these five emails, uh, follow up with this person. And all my work from that meeting was actually delegated by the time I started the next meeting versus everything kind of accumulating and then you get to the end of the day and you're like, I have 100 things to do.</p>
</details>

所以，学习通过声音授权，如果你看看 Athena 中所有超级授权者，他们整天都在通过声音授权。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so learning to delegate by voice, if you look at all the super delegators at Athena, they are all just delegating by voice all day long,</p>
</details>

### AI 助理的愿景：无声的委托

是的，这很有趣。最终，它会变成这样：我甚至不必说出来，我只需要思考就可以了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it's fascinating. Well, at some point it's going to be, you know, not I don't even have to say it, I just think it.</p>
</details>

是的，这是 Athena 长期愿景的一部分。你不必真正说出来。我们已经为此构建了一个内部演示。它还没有对客户开放。但它的工作方式是，我们构建了一个可以观察你屏幕并截屏的东西，当它识别出你应该委托给助理的事情时，它会自动将其添加到助理的任务列表中。你的助理会说：“哦，埃里克（Eric）会希望我帮忙处理这个，或者也许他会自己处理。”这有效地创造了强化学习，用于调整模型，以便从你的屏幕上拉取任务。你不需要说出来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, this is uh this is part of our vision uh Athena longer term is you shouldn't have to actually vocalize it. No. And we've built an internal demo of this. It's it uh it's not live. uh for customers. But the way it works is we build something that watches your screen as you work and it screenshots the screen and when it identifies things that you should be delegating to your assistant, it automatically adds it to your assistant's task list. Your assistant then says, "Oh, Eric would want my help with this or maybe he'll do this on his own." And that creates the reinforcement learning effectively to tune the model to pull things off of your screen. You don't have to vocalize.</p>
</details>

使用它的人发现，他现在的大部分委托都是机器生成的。他没有说话，他只是在工作，机器神奇地将任务拉出来放在他助理的盘子上。将该技术推向市场和实现还需要一段时间，但这才是未来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so the person who built this internally, he's been using it. The majority of his delegations are now machine generated. Yeah, he's not talking. He's just working and the machine is magically pulling tasks and putting on his assistance plate. Uh it'll take a while to bring that to market and fruition, but that's the that's the future.</p>
</details>

还应该有一个相关版本，就像你在 Slack 中看到的那样，有人过生日或生孩子，它会建议：“嘿，你想给这个人送这个特定的礼物吗？”是的，我认为这是我们深入思考人机融合以及如何实现两者的最佳结合的地方。这确实是 Athena 的愿景：将最好的人类助理和最好的 AI 包装成一个统一的产品，实现无缝衔接。人类显然具有人情味和良好的用户体验（UX）。但机器可以记住一切，并且非常积极主动。它可以查看每一封电子邮件、每一个日程表，并提醒你做那些你本来不会想到的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There should also be relatedly there should also be a version where it's like you know you see in Slack that's you know it's someone's birthday or someone has a baby or something and it suggests hey do you want to yep you know get this person this this specific gift or something. Yeah, I think this is a place where we're thinking a lot about the human machine merger and how we get the best of both. And that's really the vision Athena is like the best human assistant, the best AI wrapped into one combined uh product that's seamless. And humans off obviously have human touch and good UX. Uh but what machines can do is remember everything and be super proactive. who can look through every email, every calendar and remind you to do things that you would not have thought to do otherwise.</p>
</details>

### 国际人才与财务授权

你一直非常关注国际劳动力，有些人称之为“劳动力套利”。如何正确看待菲律宾的人能做什么或不能做什么，与美国的助理相比？因为显然存在巨大的成本节约。你保留哪些成本节约或哪些不保留？正确的思考方式是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One thing you've always been fascinated about is sort of um international labor some call, you know, labor arbitrage. What is the right way of thinking about what people in say the Philippines um can do or can't do verse, you know, assistance in the US? Like how do people because obviously there's a huge cost savings. Um what what are stuff that you keep in that cost savings or stuff that you don't keep or like what's the right way of thinking?</p>
</details>

美国的优势在于创业精神、资本、创新和技术。你能将多少后台任务委托给他人，就能将更多地投入到技术、产品等方面。所以，我认为 Athena 关注的是行政助理，可以处理所有这些行政工作。但人们正在为各种事情使用全球人才，包括法律、医疗等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I mean America's strength is entrepreneurship, capital, innovation, technology and um the more you can leverage someone to do back office tasks, the more you can spend on technology, product, etc. So, you know, I think the the thing Athena focuses on is executive assistant, someone who can do all of this admin. Um but people uh are using global talent for all sorts of things for legal, medical, um all the above.</p>
</details>

让我们来谈谈财务方面。我很好奇，因为我没有在那里利用我的助理。人们可以从中获得杠杆的方式有哪些？你是否仍然与会计师打交道？还是他们……是的，正确的思考方式是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So let's get a little bit on the finance thing. I'm curious because I I don't leverage mine there. What are the ways that people could get leverage from this because are you are you still interfacing with with the accountants or are they do Yeah. What is the right way of thinking about?</p>
</details>

我首先建议的是，如果你要雇佣助理，让他们帮你省钱。如果你预算充足，那没什么大不了的，但第一个项目可以是：“嘿，通过查看我的所有订阅、寻找可以节省开支的项目、为我寻找退款，来帮助支付你的工资。”所以这只是一个成本节约的类别。然后是行政工作，支付账单。然后是协调，这基本上就是你所说的项目管理（PM）。所以协调税务律师需要会计师提供的文件，这涉及到在系统之间移动文书工作。在足够的规模和复杂性下，这有效地成为了一份全职工作。显然，你需要一个你真正信任的人深入参与其中。我们建议你随着时间的推移建立这种信任：一开始给予电子邮件和日程访问权限，银行账户稍后给。随着你赢得信任，你给予的访问权限越多，你获得的杠杆就越大。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So I the first thing I'd recommend if uh you're getting an assistant uh is to have them help you save money. Uh if you have a big budget, not a big deal, but the first project can be, hey, help pay for your salary by looking through all my subscriptions, finding things to say, save me money, find me refunds. Um so that's just kind of like a cost-saving bucket. Um then there's admin paying bills. Um and then there's coordination, which is what you're talking about, basically being a PM. So coordinating, you know, the tax attorney asks for something from the accountant, and there's a bunch of docs, and it's just moving paperwork between Yeah. uh systems um at enough scale and complexity that becomes effectively a full-time job. And obviously you need someone you truly trust uh to go deep with and we kind of recommend that you build this trust over time and you know you give email and calendar access at first and bank account later. Uh but as you earn that trust then the more access you give effectively the more leverage you get.</p>

### 跨文化团队与助理的价值重塑

是的，这真的很令人着迷。关于扩展这家公司，你有过什么有趣的见解吗？你处理过不同地区的工作力量以及你如何看待他们之间的文化，以及在确保正确方面，挑战或最重要的是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. the um yes it's really interesting and and in terms of um say more about what it's been like to scale this company where you have and you know you dealt with this thumb thumb too a little bit in terms of just work forces in different areas and how you think about culture between them and um yeah kind of what are the the challenges or what's really important to get right</p>
</details>

是的。我们寻找的是对美国文化有强烈亲和力的文化。菲律宾与美国有着悠久的历史。他们对美国流行文化和体育的了解比我更深。而且他们有非常强烈的职业道德，而且这是一种**关怀型（caretaking）**文化。所以那里有很多护士。我们选择菲律宾作为助理服务的原因之一是，成为行政助理实际上就是照顾某人。他们的全职工作就是让你的生活更美好，为你分担事务，帮助你取得成功。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah um yeah I mean we we look for cultures that have a strong affinity uh to American culture Uh, you know, Philippines has a long history with America. They like know American pop culture and sports better than I do. Um, and then they have a very strong work ethic and u, it's a caretaking um, culture. So, there's lots of nurses and one of the reasons we picked it for assistance is being an executive assistant is really taking care of someone.</p>
</details>

我认为一些人对助理感到抗拒的一个障碍是，这感觉像是放纵。他们会想：“我真的应该有一个人只是照顾我吗？”但我将这种观点扭转过来：你不授权、不给予杠杆，这阻碍了你，但实际上是阻止了你为那些渴望帮助你的人创造工作机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's like their full-time job is to make your life better, is to take things off your plate, to help you be successful. And I think one of the uh barriers for some people to get an assistant is it feels indulgent. It's like, do I should I really have someone who's just taking care of me? Um, but the way I flip that around is you not delegating and you not giving leverage is holding you back, but it's actually preventing you from creating a job for someone who's excited to help you. Yeah.</p>
</details>

对于我们团队中的人来说，他们可以与首席执行官共事，他们可以看到这个令人兴奋的初创公司背后的运作，这对他们来说是完全不同的生活。对他们来说，这是一件很酷、很令人兴奋、改变生活的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And for the people on our team, like they get to work with a CEO, they get to see behind this exciting startup that um is a totally different life than they live. And for them, that is a cool, exciting, life-changing thing.</p>
</details>

### 助理在目标实现中的作用

我认为人们应该更多地利用助理的另一个方面，那就是**问责制（Accountability）**。比如，你希望自己锻炼到某个程度，或者你希望把时间花在 XYZ 上，或者你想确保你按时参加预约等等。我们有一些客户因为这个原因和他们的助理一起锻炼吗？比如他们都有健身目标，所以他们在设定好的时间拉起视频一起锻炼，这是人类问责制比机器问责制更强大的地方。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. One thing that I think people should be using assistance more for is uh is not only delegation but also accountability of like hey you want to be you know exercising this amount or you want to be spending your time doing XYZ or you want to make sure you you know you go to your appointments or or something. Oh, do we have some uh clients who actually exercise live with their assistants for this reason? Like they both have a fitness goal and so they pull up videos at a set time and they work out together and that's the place where human accountability is a little more powerful than machine accountability.</p>
</details>

ChatGPT 现在有一个功能，可以自动提醒你一些事情。所以如果你负担不起助理，你就告诉 ChatGPT：“这是我的五个主要目标，每天问我进展如何，记录我的结果，并给我反馈。”你每月只需 20 美元就能做到这一点。我曾与人类助理做过类似的事情，过去我们可能做过，我说：“嘿，我想锻炼、冥想、吃得健康，每天给我发一个 WhatsApp 提醒，我每天回复‘是’或‘否’，告诉我是否做到了。”然后在每周结束时，给我一份记分卡，并将我与 Eric 或 Katherine 进行比较，我们可以进行一些良性竞争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Chatpt actually has a feature now where it will automatically ping you on things. So if you can't afford assistant, you just tell CatchPT, here's my top five goals, ask me how I'm doing every day, log my results, and give me feedback. You can get that for 20 bucks uh a month. Um I've done similar versions of this with Human Assistant. I think we may have done this in the past where I'm like, "Hey, I want to work out, meditate, eat clean, send me a a ping on WhatsApp every day, and I'll just reply yes, no, yes, no whether I did it." And then at the end of each week, send me a scorecard and compare me to Eric or Katherine and we can have a little competition with it.</p>
</details>

是的，帮助你实现目标正是他们应该做的。另外，我认为这是一个获得更多杠杆的有趣机会，因为这些人不仅精通运营，而且非常直观，他们从事关怀领域，所以也有教练的机会。他们是对你最有背景的人，可以就你的参与方式提供反馈，或者他们可以告诉你：“嘿，你今天很累，你知道的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And yeah, helping you helping you hit your goals is exactly what they should be doing. Yeah. And then the other thing I think is uh an interesting opportunity to get more leverage because these people are also you know um not just operation savvy but also you know pretty you know uh intuitive you know they go into caring fields and so there's also like opportunities for coaching too or like there you know they're the people that have most context on you and they can give feedback on how you're engaging or like you know they can tell you hey you're tired today you know. Yeah, the</p>

那是我在西翼时的第一个观察。坐在总统身边的助理们太厉害了。他们非常出色。他们后来当选为国会议员，都是了不起的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that was my first observation uh when I was in the West Wing. The assistants who sat next to the president were insane. They were so good. They went on to become like elected to Congress and amazing people.</p>
</details>

但在一天结束时，总统和他的顾问们会与参议员和所有这些人会面，会议结束后，他们会向后靠，让助理走过来，他们只是问：“发生了什么事？”这不仅仅是完成任务。这是他们最亲密的知己，看到了幕后的一切。他们知道好的一面和坏的一面。他们知道自己那天因为各种事情被“踢了屁股”（遭受挫折）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um but at the end of the day, the president, his adviserss would have been meeting with senators and all these people and they would finish the meeting, they would lean back and they would have the assistant come over and they'd just be like, "What's going on?" And it was it was more than just accomplishing things. This was their closest confidant who saw behind the scenes on everything. They knew the good and the bad. They know they'd gotten kicked in the nuts a couple times that day from different things.</p>
</details>

他们就在那里支持他。我认为这种人性化的元素在很长一段时间内仍然很重要，无论 AI 变得多好。我们有一些客户告诉我们，他们在经历离婚或抑郁时，我的助理以一种其他人无法做到的方式支持我，我不能告诉我的公司或团队关于这些事情，但这个人就在你身边，是内部人士。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And they're there for them. And I think that human element is going to remain important for a long time, no matter how uh good AI gets. And it's something you should lean into. We have uh clients who tell us that yeah like going through a divorce or a depression and like my assistant's like there for me in a way that others aren't and like I can't tell my company or my team about some of these things but it's this is the person that's like on the inside with you.</p>
</details>

### 目标设定的周期性与优先级

完全正确。与此相关的是，你多年来在如何分配时间方面一直有一些非常有趣的见解。思考时间管理，不仅仅是通过授权来获得更多时间的方式，还包括如何确定优先级。我从你那里学到了这一点：你按年度、季度等不同时间间隔来思考目标。也许我们可以从 LBD（Life Board Directors，生命董事会）开始，谈谈你对目标设定的总体看法，然后我们可以深入探讨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, totally. Relatedly, one of the things you've had really interesting insights on over the years is um is how to spend time. think about time management not not only in terms of ways to get more of it v via delegating but also you know h how to prioritize and you know I've I've learned this from from you but you think about goals on a sort of you know annual quarterly you know like on different increments why don't you maybe we could start with LBD and how you think about goal setting in general and then we can you know bit deeper</p>
</details>

是的。我的妻子凯瑟琳和我——我们是通过一次创业晚宴发展起来的友谊——我们读了克莱顿·克里斯坦森（Clayton Christensen）写的《如何衡量你的人生》。他基本上讲述了哈佛商学院教授的孩子们在同学会上回来时，他们是财富 500 强的 CEO，非常富有，但他们的生活却一团糟：他们离婚了，孩子不和他们说话，甚至有人进了监狱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah I mean my wife Katherine and I who uh we met as friends one of you know developed this friendship over one of these entrepreneurship dinners. We read this book um called How You Measure Your Life by Clayton Christensen and he basically told the story of how Harvard Business School professor kids come back at reunions and they're Fortune 500 CEOs, super rich and their lives are in shambles. They're divorced, have all these problems, the kids don't talk to them and going to jail.</p>
</details>

他在商业中应用的严谨性、季度审查、衡量标准，在他们的生活中完全缺失。他的观点是：你想如何衡量你的人生？凯瑟琳和我当时只是朋友，但我们都觉得：“我想成为你人生的董事会成员。我们来做这件事吧。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And he's like the rigor they apply to their businesses, the quarterly reviews, the metrics were completely absent from their life. And his point was, how do you want to measure your life? And Katherine and I read this book and we were just friends at the time, but we're both like, I want to be on your life board directors. Let's freaking do that.</p>
</details>

所以我们十年前就开始了这个传统。每个季度我们都会聚在一起，填写一份关于我们关系、优势和劣势的调查问卷，做一些 SWOT 分析之类的书呆子事情，然后我们讨论我们可以改进什么，我们可以做得更好什么。如果你投入越多，它就会变得越好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so we just started tradition a decade ago. Every quarter we get together, we fill out a survey on our relationship, uh strengths and weaknesses, kind of squat analysis, geeky stuff, and then we talk about like what can we improve, uh what could we do better, and like anything if you the more you invest, the better it gets.</p>
</details>

完全同意。是的，我认为这是一个关键点，因为有些人对量化感到反感，他们希望他们的关系是放松的，或者关掉的。我认为重点不在于你必须量化它的每一个元素，而在于你不希望因为缺乏量化而意味着你没有优先考虑它。所以这只是一个练习，以确保你实际上只是让你想成为的那个自己保持问责制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Totally. And yeah, I think that's a key point because some people are turned off by sort of like uh quantification like they want their relationship placed like you know relax or turn off or something. I think it's less that you have to like, you know, quantify every element of it and more just that you want to prior you you don't want to let the lack of quantification mean that you're not prioritizing it. Um, and so this is just an exercise to make sure that you're actually just like keeping accountable to how you want to be.</p>
</details>

完全正确。就是要**有目的性地（be purposeful）**，得到你想要的东西。如果你像我们一样是书呆子，那么你就衡量它并跟踪所有内容。如果你只是想出去约会、喝酒、谈论你们的关系，那也行。我认为这只是人们优先考虑健身或工作，但他们从不考虑如何优先考虑他们的关系？就像健身或瑜伽对我的关系来说，等价物是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Exactly. It's uh be purposeful, get the thing you want. If you're a geek like us, then you measure it and you track everything. Uh, and if you just want to go have like a date and drink wine and talk about your relationship, that works too. I think it's just the people prioritize fitness or their work, but they never think about how do I prioritize my relationship? Like what's the what's the fitness or the workout or the yoga equivalent for my relationship?</p>
</details>

### 幂律与核心优先事项

在与你一起参加的许多目标设定会议中，我发现你直觉上理解或学到的一件事是关于**优先级（Prioritization）**的想法。当人们设定目标时，他们会设定很多目标，但他们不会考虑：“嘿，哪个目标能让所有其他目标都变得更容易？”你知道，如果我们做成了哪一件事情，那将是伟大的一年、一个伟大的季度，无论如何。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Having been in many goal setting sessions with you, one of the things I think that you intuitively understand or have learned um and are often instilling in others is this idea of um prioritization. Like when people set goals, they set a lot of goals and they don't sort of think about, hey, what is the one that makes everything else much easier? Um and uh you know, what is the one the one thing that if we did would be a great year, a great quarter, whatever it is.</p>
</details>

谁设定的目标太多了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Who sets too many goals?</p>
</details>

我有点。但是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, me a little bit. Uh but uh but yeah.</p>
</details>

我认为我的观点是，万事万物都存在**幂律（Power Law）**，商业中有幂律，风险投资中有幂律，生活中也有幂律。通常每个月或每个季度都会有一件事，如果你完成了，它的价值就超过了所有其他事情的总和。你应该做的就是找出那一件事情是什么。找出那件事，然后全力以赴。这并不是说有其他目标不值得做，但如果你没有确定那一件事情并全力以赴使其发生，我认为就没有优化。而且，拥有一个长长的清单，更容易拖延生活中最重要的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think my view is there's a power law in everything and power law in business, power law in venture, power law in your life. And there's typically one thing every month or quarter that if you accomplish is worth more than everything else combined. And figuring out what that one thing is uh is what you should do. Figure that thing out and then go all in on that. And not to say that having other goals isn't worthwhile, but if you haven't identified the one thing and gone all in to make that happen, then I think it's not optimized. I think it's also easier to kind of procrastinate on the most important thing in your life by having a a long list. Yeah.</p>
</details>

你做很多不同的事情，但有一件核心的事情。找到你的伴侣，创办企业，修复我的健康。这比其他任何事情都更基础。

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you do a bunch of different things, but there's that one thing. It's find your partner, it's start the business, it's fix my health. That really is more foundational than everything else.</p>
</details>

### 日历设计与时间控制

为此，我很想知道你生活中遵循的时间框架或原则。例如，我相信你会尽量将会议安排在一天或尽可能少的几天内，或者其他什么。对你来说，哪些框架在时间、精力方面很重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So to that end, um I'm curious if you could share more, you know, frameworks or principles you live by in terms of time. Like for example, I I believe you put you try to stack meetings in, you know, in a day or in as few days as possible or something. What are what are certain sort of frameworks that are important for you in terms of time, energy, you know,</p>
</details>

从高层次来看，布莱恩·约翰逊想打破生物学的束缚，而我想打破时间的束缚。我问自己的问题是：世界上最有价值的资产是什么？不是黄金、比特币或英伟达集群。而是时间。我们可以随时再筹集一轮资金或再做一笔交易，但你无法再争取一个十年。所以，如果时间是主要的资产，而且它比其他任何事情都更基础，我们就应该专注于拥有和控制它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean high level is Brian Johnson wants to break the chains of biology or longevity. I want to break the chains of time and you know the question I asked myself is like what's the most valuable asset in the world? It's not gold or bitcoin or nvidia clusters. It's time. Uh we can always raise another round or do another trade but you can't raise another decade. And so if time is the primary asset uh and it's more foundational than everything else, we should focus on owning that and controlling it.</p>
</details>

对于不同的人来说，这意味着不同的事情。如果你处于高强度的扩张模式，这可能意味着一天工作 14 小时，每半小时开会一次，你只是在筛选面试并做只有你作为创始人才能做的事情。或者，这可能意味着清空你的日程表，有时间去梦想产品的未来或大笔交易。我认为你只需要知道你处于业务的哪个阶段，然后有目的地围绕它设计你的日历。如果你回顾上个月，日历没有反映你最高的那些目标，那么你就做错了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so for different this means different things for different people. If you are in hardcore scale mode, that may mean halfhour meetings for 14 hours a day where you are just grinding out interviews and doing things that only you can do as a founder. uh or it may mean clearing your schedule and having time to dream about the future of the product or big deals. And I think you just have to know what stage of the business you're in and then design your calendar purposefully around that. And if you look back on the last month and the calendar does not reflect your highest goals, then uh you're not doing it right.</p>
</details>

我记得基思·拉博伊斯（Keith Rabois）与我分享过这个想法：在每周结束时，对过去一周进行日历审计，看看你参加了哪些希望没有参加的会议，然后看看下周。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I remember uh Keith Rabois shared with me this idea of like at the end of every week do a calendar audit of the past week like what are the meetings you had that you wish you wouldn't have and then just look at the next week.</p>
</details>

当然，Athena 的助理可以为你主动做这件事，但 AI 显然将自动化一个领域，而且它会非常强大。或者在每周结束时，它只是告诉你：“这是你优先考虑的事情，这实际上是你的目标。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean there's a place uh you know Athena assistants can do this proactively for you but there's a place that AI is obviously going to automate and it will be very powerful or it's at the end of it each week it just tells you here's what you prioritized those actually your goals. Yeah,</p>
</details>

如果不是，那么下周我们就应该调整这些事情。

<p class="english-text">If not then next week we should adjust those things.</p>

### 异步与同步的权衡

我对你对会议的解读很好奇。有些人认为：“我希望开会越少越好。我不是最高效的。我宁愿异步处理所有事情。”你对异步和同步的看法如何？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I'm curious for your interpretation of meetings. Some people are like uh you know I I want to have as few meetings as possible. Me is not the most efficient. I'd rather do everything async. What what is your kind of</p>
</details>

纳瓦尔（Naval）有一句很好的话：“电话会议比会议好。语音留言比电话好。短信比语音留言好。”总的来说，我认为这是真的。而且这几乎是一种代际现象，我感觉你有点处于这种状态：人们不愿意打电话，我们所有的事情都通过短信和电子邮件完成，但打电话非常有效。它的带宽很高，你可以在 5 分钟内弄清楚。所以，我个人会尽量减少会议，然后多打几通电话。当我处于更多“主席模式”时，我会优先考虑尽可能少的会议，并使用语音留言。我要求的是发出语音留言，然后用短信回复，因为听语音留言很慢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean Naval has a good line that's like uh a phone call is better than a meeting. A voice notes is better than a call. A text is better than a voice note. Uh I think in general that's true. And uh there's this it's almost like a generational thing where I feel like you're in this a little bit of like there's a reluctance to call people on the phone and it's just we do everything text and email but calling people is super effective. It's really high bandwidth. You can figure out in 5 minutes. And so uh I personally try to minimize meetings and then do more picking up the phone and talking to someone for five minutes. Um, when I'm in more chairman mode, then I prioritize as few meetings as possible and voice notes and um I uh I what I request is voice notes out and text message back because read listening to voice notes is slow.</p>
</details>

这就像市场营销的攻击。是的。这很有趣。我最喜欢的自助书之一是《高效能人士的七个习惯》，其中一个原则是关于任务完成的效率，但关于人际关系则是关于有效性。所以，你知道，高效的路径可能不是有效的路径，因为你可能在前端节省了一些时间，但你可能会在后端积累一些债务。是的。而且，只发短信可能很有效率，但保持动态很重要。电话显然被低估了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's assault as marketing. Yeah. Um yeah it is interest you u one of my favorite self-help books is the seven effective habits of how effective people and one of their you know principles maxims is this idea of like efficiency with when it comes to achieving uh you know tasks or accomplishing tasks but effectiveness when it comes to people and and so um you know the efficient path might not be the effective path because you might you sort of save some time on the front end but you might you know acrew sort of a debt on the on the back end. Yeah. And um yeah, it might be efficient to just send a text or something, but you know, keeping the dynamic. Yeah, phone calls are obviously under underrated. And</p>
</details>

是的，这很对。远程文化也是如此。远程文化会积累带宽不足的债务。所以，如果你处于远程文化中，你应该每隔几个月聚在一起几天。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah, that's true. Remote cultures, too. Like remote cultures build up debt of just the lack of bandwidth. And so if you are in a remote culture, you should get together every couple months for a few days in person.</p>
</details>

### 创始人时间分配的框架

你如何看待创始人寻求建议时关于如何分配时间的问题？什么最重要？哪些框架对创始人思考时间分配有帮助？显然，他们可以做的事情太多了，一天的时间甚至不够他们做其中的一小部分。哪些是最重要的？无论是你在 Thumbtac 时的时间，还是其他方面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">H how do you think about how when founders are asking for advice like how how should I spend time? Like what what's most important? like what frameworks are helpful for founders about thinking about obviously there's a million things they could be doing there's not enough time in the day for you know even a fraction of them what are the most important ways to to get right whether it's your time at</p>
</details>

Thumbtac 的经验是：构建你的产品、服务客户、筹集资金、建立你的团队。当创始人问我如何利用助理，我应该做什么时，我的回答是：你这个月有两个主要目标是什么？如果目标是招聘，你就必须完成候选人的签约。但你不需要负责所有邮件的筛选。你可以打开语音记录说：“这是我想让你发出的模板。让我看看我的联系人，这里有 20 个人。”发送一封外联邮件，请他们为这个职位提供建议。如果你的目标是筹集资金，你的助理可以帮助项目管理整个流程。所以，第一步是设定目标，然后将其分解为子任务。你的助理无法独立完成整个融资，但可以运行其中的组成部分。你的工作就是将事情分解成你可以移交的最小部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">thumbtack look is build your product customers raise capital build your team and when founders ask me like how to leverage an assistant what should I be doing my the way I turn around is like what's your top two goals for the month if it's recruiting uh you have to be closing candidates But you don't need to be sourcing all of the emails. You could pull up a voice note and say, "Here's a template I want you to reach out to. Here's let me go through my contacts. Here's 20 people." Send an outreach email asking them for suggestions for this role. Uh, you know, if your goal is to raise capital, your assistant could help project manage the the process of all of that. And so, you know, step one is you set your goals and then you break them down into subtasks. and your assistant won't be able to run the fund raise but can run components of it and your job is just to decompose things into the smallest part that you can hand off.</p>
</details>

### 助理与客户的共同成长

也许你应该有一种“前沿部署”的东西，不仅仅是助理，还有能帮你真正获得最大杠杆并观察你的活动的人。我们从这个业务中学到的一个经验是，当我们刚开始时，我们想：“我们只雇佣最好的助理，将他们与客户匹配，然后就成功了。”但我们匹配了前五个助理后，每个客户都说了同样的话：“我如何授权日程？我如何授权收件箱？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Maybe you should have some sort of like forward deployed uh you know sort of thing of what's it's not just the assistant but it's also someone that helps you like really get the most leverage out of it and watches you know your your activity. One of our learnings from this business when we first started it, we were like, we're just going to hire the best assistants, match them with clients, and boom, amazing. But we matched the first five assistants, and every single client said the same thing. How do I delegate calendar? How do I delegate inbox?</p>
</details>

因此，很明显，我们需要投入更多精力来实际**教导客户如何授权（teaching the clients how to delegate）**，因为这与助理本身一样是一个限制因素。我们有几千名助理和客户。如果你看看 Athena 中表现最好的助理，他们为最好的授权者工作。这不是巧合。他们之所以是最好的，是因为有人想出了如何导出他们的想法、分解项目、创建 SOP，以帮助助理腾飞。而那些平庸的授权者在这方面会遇到困难，需要更多的培训。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so it became clear we need to invest more in actually teaching the clients how to delegate uh because that is as much of a constraint as the assistants. And we've got a few thousand assistants and clients. And if you look at the best performing assistants at Athena, they work for the best delegators. It's not a coincidence. The reason they're the best is because someone has figured out how to export their ideas, decompose projects, create SOPs in a way that helps the assistant fly and the more mediocre delegators uh struggle with that and need more training.</p>

### 高级人才招聘：超越面试

你在 Stump Tech 或招聘高管方面一直非常出色。你认为你做有什么不同？或者哪些原则或框架真正指导了你的高管招聘流程？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. One one thing that you've been phenomenal at is whether it's Stump Tech or is is hiring executives. What do you think that you do differently or what what are the principles or frameworks that really guide your sort of exec hiring process?</p>
</details>

一个明显的事实是，高管职位越高，他们就越擅长面试，这几乎是定义使然。所以当你达到高管级别时，他们都非常擅长面试。因此，随着职位越来越高，你实际上必须更多地摒弃面试本身。我越往上走，就越依赖推荐信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean one thing that is obvious as you hire execs is the more senior they go the better they are at interviewing almost by definition and so when you get to seuite they all are really good at interviewing and so you actually have to discard the interview more the more senior they go and so I re uh uh I I use references much more the higher you go and then the other thing that I think is interesting that people should do more of is I just ask people for their 360 reviews</p>
</details>

我想说的另一件有趣的事情是，我直接向他们索要他们上一家公司 10 个人对他们写下的、关于他们的优势和劣势的诚实评价。我只是要求看看。我说：“嘿，我会分享我的，你分享你的。”我实际上认为这对于初创公司来说是一个很酷的推荐流程，你可以向 LLM 询问某人，而不是询问他们的推荐人。所以，我试图更多地获取关于这个人的“地面真相”，而不是面试的用户体验（UX），当你达到高级职位时，它会变得相当好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">like at their last company, 10 people wrote reviews of them that are honest about their strengths and weaknesses. And I just asked to see it and I say, "Hey, I'll share you share mine. You show me yours. I actually think this would be a cool kind of reference pro startup um where you could like ping the LM about someone versus pinging their references." So, I try to get to more ground truth on the person versus the UX of an interview is just gonna be pretty good when you get to the senior level.</p>
</details>

在做推荐核实时，最重要的是什么？你如何从中获得最多的信号？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What's most important in when you when you're doing reference checks? What do you really What's the way to get the most signal out of them?</p>
</details>

我经常告诉人们：“嘿，我可能会雇佣这个人。现在，告诉我所有你不喜欢他的地方，或者他可以改进的地方。”因为人们非常倾向于只告诉你所有好的方面。你必须让他们认为这是一个可以分享优势和劣势的安全场所。是的，多做几次推荐，直到他们的说法开始一致。一旦他们开始说同样的话，你就得到了一个信号。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, what I often tell people is, hey, I'm probably going to hire this person. Uh, and now tell me all the things you don't like about them or things that they could be better at. Cuz if you know, people are so biased to just tell you all the good things. You have to get them to uh to see it as a safe place to share strengths and weaknesses. And yeah, just do enough references until they start to sound the same. And once they start to sound the same, then you've got a signal.</p>
</details>

我喜欢问的一个问题是：“需要补充什么技能组合才能与这个人互补？”这只是换了一种说法，问他们哪里不好。或者我最喜欢问的问题之一是：“如果这个人 6 个月或一年后没有成功，原因会是什么？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. One question I like to ask is um what skill sets would be really important to complement this person with? Um which is another way of just saying what are they bad? Like you know what's really important? Or one of my favorite questions is if this didn't work out in 6 months or a year, you know, why would that be?</p>
</details>

是的。招聘人才的最佳方式是询问你最尊重、标准最高的人：“谁是最好的人？”所以，比如，我问这个领域标准最高的三个人：“谁是最好的两个人或三个人？”然后我去找其中一个来雇佣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. And I mean the best way to source talent um I just hired an executive recently is just ask the people that you respect the most that have the highest standards. Who's the best person? So like here's the three people who have the highest standards in this role. I ask them for the two or three best people and I go try to hire one of them.</p>
</details>

这是快速招聘高管的方式。你知道，使用高管招聘人员，你会花三个月时间，得到所有冷门线索。但通过一个高标准人才的网络，效率非常高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that is the like speed rapid way to hire an exec. Um you know using an exec recruiter you spend three months you get all this cold leads but going through a network of high bar people is super efficient.</p>
</details>

有一个格言说，大约一半的高管在 12 到 24 个月内就离职了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's some maxim that almost like half of executives you know don't work out within like a you know 12 to 24 month period checks out.</p>
</details>

为什么会这样？我认为这是因为很难判断——面试过程不能代表他们正在做的工作。这最终是面试中出现的问题：面试应该是某人做他们将要做的工作。我记得 Weebly 当年会让高管试用两周才正式雇佣。这很难实现，因为人们有其他工作。但我确实认为类似的做法很有意义。在很多情况下，你的面试过程与他们实际做的工作相比，是无关紧要的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Why is that? I think it's this it's difficult to uh judge uh the interview process is not representative of the work they're doing. And that's ultimately what's broken about interviewing is interviewing should be someone doing the work they're going to do. Um I think it was like Weebly back in the day would actually have execs come work for two weeks to trial before they ever hired. That's difficult to pull off because people have other jobs. But I do think something like that makes a lot of sense. your interview process is just kind of irrelevant compared to what the work they're doing in lots of cases.</p>
</details>

基思有一个格言说：“你不会 100% 都能在招聘中成功，就像你不会 100% 在投资中成功一样。”如果你想避免不承担足够风险或行动太慢的陷阱，只要你迅速止损，那就可以了。如果你不及时止损，你就会复合性地陷入困境，那才是痛苦的根源。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And Keith has this maxim that that's like um you you're not going to get 100% hiring in the same way you're not going to get 100% investing. And if you know like you also want to avoid the you know of not the uh trap of not taking enough risk or moving too slow.</p>
</details>

是的。而且只要你快速止损，那就没关系。如果你不及时止损，你就会复合性地陷入困境，那才是痛苦的根源。对于几乎所有的面试流程来说，更实用的方法是基于项目的**工作（project based work）**。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And as long as you cut your losses quickly it's okay. It's if you like don't cut losses then you compound a hole and that's where it's painful. The the other thing I'd say is more useful for basically all interview process is project based work. Yeah.</p>
</details>

所以，比如招聘一个高管来领导团队的某个部门，我只是告诉他们组织中的痛点是什么，以及我想解决什么问题，然后我说：“拿出一个计划，如果你被雇佣了，你会如何解决这个问题？”这种实际的工作更有用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So just like hiring uh seuite for one pro uh one part of the team I just tell them what the pain points in the org are and what I want to fix and I'm like come up with a plan like how would you fix this like if you we hire you you're then going to do it and that sort of practical work is more useful.</p>

### 创始人透明度与危机处理

这真的很令人兴奋。回到其他创始人原则，你对公司**透明度（Transparency）**的立场如何？哪些信息对公司员工有帮助？回到 Thumbtac 的日子，公司需要让员工知道什么？指导你分享多少信息的原则是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah that's really interesting. What um going back to other sort of founder principles what is your stance on um transparency with the company like what's information that's helpful maybe going back to thumbtack days what's helpful for the the company to employees to know like what what are principles that that guide you know how much you share</p>
</details>

默认的透明度显然是最好的，但显然也有一些界限。在 Thumbtac，大约十年前有一个时刻，你可能还记得，我醒来时收到了我们菲律宾团队某人的信息，上面写着：“Thumbtac 在互联网上不存在了。”我想：“什么？”我去了谷歌，输入 Thumbtac，什么也没显示出来。我们基本上收到了谷歌的“死刑判决”。这是一个误解，他们以为我们做错了什么，但他们把我们从互联网上清除了。所以我们的流量归零，我们的收入归零。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah I mean default transparency is obviously the best but there's obviously some lines like there's uh you know at thumbtac there was a moment you may remember this decade ago where I woke up and I had a message from someone on our team in the Philippines and it said Thumbtac does not exist on the internet. I was like what? And I went to Google. You type in Thumbtac and nothing shows up. And we basically received the death penalty from Google.</p>
</details>

我记得我醒来后去了办公室，那里有一批 25 名新 Thumbtacker，他们是第一天入职。我本该和他们一起做入职培训。外面有一个记者试图获取引语。你知道，那是你不能分享一切的时刻之一。所以，你最终希望保持透明，但如果我走进一个新班级，说：“嘿，公司可能要倒闭了”，那是不行的。所以你必须控制住局势。需要知道的人知道，一旦有了计划和解决方案，整个公司就会被告知。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh there was a misunderstanding. They thought we had done something wrong, but they like eliminated us from the internet. And so our traffic went to zero and our revenue went to zero. And I remember waking up and like I go to the office and there's a class of 25 new thumbtackers who it's their first day. I'm supposed to do the onboarding with them. There's a journalist like walking around outside trying to get a quote. And you know that's one of those times where you can't share everything. And so uh you want to ultimately be transparent but if I just walked into a new class and say hey the business might be dead uh that's not going to work. And so you have to kind of get a handle of the situation. uh you know the people who need to know it know it and then once there's a plan and a solution in place then the whole company uh is told</p>
</details>

### 联合创始人关系：只有一个创始人

是的，这有道理。在 Thumbtac，你是一位非 CEO 的联合创始人，你坚持了近十年，当然现在仍在董事会中。我感觉联合创始人团队中这种情况相当罕见，尤其是如果不是 CTO，通常不会持续超过 5 年。我很想知道在联合创始人关系中，什么对你来说很重要，或者你如何看待向你投资的公司提供建议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah that that makes sense. Um at Thumbtac you were a nonCEO co-founder and you lasted you know a decade or almost decade and you're still on the board of course. Um I feel like it's pretty rare when I think about co-founding teams that it feels like the nonCEO especially if not a CTO usually doesn't last you know over 5 years or something. Um I'm curious what's really important to get right in in co-founder relationships or how you think about advising you know companies you invest in.</p>
</details>

我听说红杉资本的迈克尔爵士（Sir Michael）说过：“只有一个创始人。”他在一次创始人活动上说的，我当时心想：“这太粗鲁了。”这里有很多联合创始人。现在十年后我才明白，当然只有一个联合创始人能坚持到底，因为最终随着组织规模的扩大，只让一个人在顶端才合乎逻辑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean the I heard Sir Michael at Sequoia say something that was like there's only one founder. Yeah. And it was at he said it at a founder event and I was like that's rude. There's lots of co-founders here. And now a decade later I'm like of course there is only one co-founder that goes the distance because ultimately as you scale the org it only makes sense to have one person on top. Yeah. Um so</p>
</details>

我认为这是现实，在开始创业时知道这一点是件好事。关于如何选择，我的建议是选择一个你想与之结婚的人。你将经历与伴侣关系中出现的所有相同问题，没有“和好性行为”，但仍然存在高潮和低谷，你想要一个你最终会深深信任的人，因为会有压力和挑战，但只要你信任基础，你就有了一个可以建立的良好基础。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that's just the reality and uh you know it's good to know that going into starting a business. Uh in terms of who to pick, my advice is you pick someone you want to get married to and you're going to have all the same relationship issues you have with a partner. uh you know, no makeup sex, but it's still like uh yeah, there's highs, lows, and you want someone that ultimately you you really deeply trust because there's going to be stress and</p>
</details>

我会在 Thumbtac 犯下的最大错误之一是——我爱我的创始人，但这是我不会推荐给别人的事情——我们有四个联合创始人，其中一个是技术人员。他大约两年后就离开了，剩下的三个都是非技术人员。这是创办科技企业最愚蠢的方式，但我们当时根本不知道自己在做什么，结果还算成功。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um challenges, but as long as you trust the foundation, then you got a good a good thing to build on. I would say, you know, one of the biggest I if I called a mistake at Thumbtac, uh because I love my founders, but it's something I wouldn't recommend others do is we had four co-founders and one was technical. He left after like two years and then the other three were non-technical.</p>
</details>

你们三个非技术人员是如何分工合作的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is like the most idiotic way to start a technology business, but we had no idea what we're doing and uh you know, it worked out. And how did you divide and conquer between those three non-technical</p>
</details>

我们只是跳到谁擅长什么事情上，但没有明确的执行者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh we just kind of jumped on things is like whoever was good at something but it was no like clear executive.</p>
</details>

是的，我认为这是不被推荐的，因为它很明显可能产生紧张关系。我们解决了这个问题，但这不符合标准，不是最佳实践。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And I think that's uh you know that's not recommended because there's like it's obvious how that could create tension. We worked through it but um that's why it's non non-standard not best practice.</p>
</details>

### 拒绝斯坦福的决定

回到最初的故事，我记得你进入了 GSB（斯坦福大学商学院），你本打算读研究生，但你和你的大学朋友们正在考虑创办这家公司，这甚至不是你个人的痛点，你只是觉得它会是一家好公司。你给 GSB 的人发邮件，告诉他们你不会接受录取，他们回信给你一封非常“不道德”的邮件，说你正在犯下你一生中最大的错误等等。结果相当不错，但你当时是如何获得足够的信念去冒险并这样做的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. Right. But um I'm going back to the original story because I remember there's this uh you got into GSB and you were going to go to grad school, but you you know had your buddies from college and you were thinking of starting this this business which wasn't even like a personal pain point. You just thought it'd be a good business and you uh emailed the you know let the GSP people know you weren't going to accept it and and they sent you back this very immoralizing email of how you're making the biggest mistake in your life. Um etc. you know, it turned out pretty good, but h how do you Pretty good decision. Um, how did you at the time think about get enough conviction to to take the leap and do it?</p>
</details>

是的，这很可怕。我考上了这所好学校。这似乎是一个安全的选择。我知道我想创办一家企业，如果我去商学院，我知道我会背负所有这些债务。我可能之后需要找一份薪水不错的工作。如果我要去拼一把，我应该直接去拼。但当院长给我发那封邮件时，我说：“这是你一生中最大的错误。”他说了一些类似“创业公司会来来去去，但你只能去一次斯坦福”之类的话。这是一个千载难逢的机会。我从未回复过，我把它保存在一封邮件中，我打算在 Thumbtac 上市时回复它，并说：“我做出了正确的决定。”我对他没有意见，他只是在做他的工作，但有点“肩上的碎屑”（有点不服输的精神）是件好事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it was scary. I uh got into, you know, this good school. Seemed like that was a safe bet. I knew I wanted to start a business and uh, you know, if I went to business school, I knew that I'd have all this debt. I probably might need to get a nice paying job afterwards. And if I was going to go for it, I should probably just go for it. But yeah, when the dean sent me that email, I was like, this is biggest mistake of your life. He said something like uh you can startups will come and go, but you can only come to Stanford once or something. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. I never responded and I have it as a email in my this save that I'm just going to respond to whenever Thumbtac goes public and be like, I made the right decision. Uh, and you know, I have nothing against this guy. He's just doing his job, but it's good to have a little uh chips on your shoulder.</p>
</details>

### 首席幕僚长与助理的区别

好的，我们回到 EA 和首席幕僚长。我们应该如何看待它们之间的区别？在首席幕僚长这个职位上，最重要的是什么？这是一个每个除了 EA 之外的人都希望自己拥有的职位，但似乎很难找到合适的人选。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, totally. Okay, so there's EAS and then there chiefs of staffs. How should we think about sort of the the difference there? And what's really important to get right in chief of staff? It's it's a role that everyone in addition to EA wishes they they had um but seems hard to find the right person.</p>
</details>

是的，没有正式的定义。我认为 EA 通常更偏向行政管理，为你分担事务。而首席幕僚长更偏向进攻性，他是那种可以跟你进会议的人。你可以派他去：“嘿，帮我主持这个会议”，或者“嘿，今天出现了这个问题，去弄清楚如何解决它。”所以首席幕僚长通常具备自己成为创始人的能力。他们之所以接受首席幕僚长的工作，只是为了体验一下做创始人的感觉，以便他们可以离开去做这件事。所以你得到的人更像是做“轮岗”的，你获得了超高的能力，但你得不到像助理那样的长期任职。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, there's no formal definition. And I think it's something that uh an EA is typically more administrative and taking things off your plate and uh chief of staff is more offensive and it's the type of person who can follow you into meetings. You could deploy to hey like actually take this meeting for me or hey this problem came up uh today go figure out how to solve it. And so a chief of staff typically has the capabilities to become a founder themselves. and the only reason they take the job as chief of staff is so they can see what it's like to be a founder so they can go off uh to do it. So you kind of get people who do more tours of duty and you get super high capability uh but you don't get the same longevity as an assistant.</p>
</details>

你对首席幕僚长寻找的是什么？或者，你如何看待这种张力：是找一个更年轻的人，他肯定会先做几年，而且更有抱负；还是找一个更有经验但可能坡度（潜力增长率）没那么高的人？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What have you looked for in chief of staff or what's sort of the right, you know, there's sort of this tension between, you know, getting someone younger who's, you know, definitely initially going to do it for for a couple years um and is more ambitious versus someone who's been more seasoned but maybe not as high slope or something. How do you think about</p>
</details>

我将其分解的方式是：助理，你找一个你想共事十年的人。亲密关系和这种关系的复合效应非常重要。所以你要深入，这意味着你可能找不到一个创始人，因为他们不会对做这件事感到兴奋。这是一个更像“照料者”且对成为第二把手感到兴奋的人。而对于首席幕僚长，我追求纯粹的“坡度”（潜力），你知道这个人会在几年后离开，但他会在你身边帮助解决问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The way I break it down is assistant, you find someone you want to go a decade with. Uh the intimacy and the compounding of that relationship is super important. And so you go deep and that means you probably don't find a founder because they're not going to be excited to do this. It's someone who's much more of a caretaker and is excited to be number two. And then a chief of staff I do pure slope where you know the person is going to move on in a couple years but they have yeah they could start a business but instead you get them by your side to help solve problems.</p>
</details>

像彼得·蒂尔（Peter Thiel）那样的人，他们有一年的首席幕僚长，然后他们创办公司，然后他们投资于他们，并建立起一种声誉。然后他们就有了一批“校友”首席幕僚长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And there there are people you know like Lonsdale maybe like a lot or something who have you know chief of staff for like a year or two and then they start a company then they invest in them and they build kind of this reputation for for doing and then they have sort of these like you know um alumni almost chief of staff just kind of you know Peter Teals just kind of further</p>
</details>

是的，贝索斯（Bezos）身边有一个人，他参加每一次会议，这很酷。

### 权力掮客的共同点：不记仇和高标准

让我们谈谈一些完成巨大成就的人，我想知道我们可以从他们身上学到什么经验。无论是像兰斯代尔（Lonsdale）那样的人，还是埃隆（Elon），还是萨姆·阿尔特曼（Sam Altman），你从他们身上学到了什么，仅仅是观察他们如何构建自己的世界，如何运作？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah let's talk about some some people who get an enormous amount done and I'm curious what are lessons that we can draw from them. Whether it's someone like Lonsdale, whether it's someone like Elon, whether it's someone like Sam Alman, who who are folks that you've particularly learned something from even just watching from afar of like how do they build their world? How do they operate? I'll just say one for for</p>
</details>

对于像兰斯代尔这样的人来说，他们将某些人才网络复合起来。所以，无论是像《斯坦福评论》还是斯坦福本身，他们经常从那里招聘人才，然后参与到人才输送管道中。他们深入参与黑客马拉松（hackathon）场景，他们只是建立了一个专有的、不断增长的人才库，他们不断地……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">someone like Londale Til has done this really well. They sort of compound these certain talent networks. So, you know, whether it's like Stanford Review or just Stanford in general, um they're often hiring people from there and then involved in sort of these talent pipelines. they sort of, you know, created, you know, they're deep in the hackathon scene, but they just kind of build this proprietary compounding sort of talent base that they're constantly, you know, sort of um</p>
</details>

人才获取是其中一部分。我认为另一部分是，有些人拥有无限的抱负，你非常像这样：“如果我能做十倍的事情会怎样？”我认为很多人只是认为那是不可能的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, the talent access is part of it. I think the other thing is there are some people who have just limitless ambition and you're very much this way of like, well, what if I could do 10 times more things? Yeah. And I think lots of people uh just think that's impossible.</p>
</details>

但事实并非如此。这是可能的，通过授权和赋权，你可以不断地复合到越来越大的规模。我们从与这些“权力委托者”合作中看到的另一件有趣的事情是，人们假设拥有巨大权力和财富或资源的人可以负担得起这个团队，这就是他们拥有这种抱负的原因。但我们实际上看到的是相反的情况：随着人们通过助理获得更多杠杆，他们的抱负就会增加。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um but it's not. it is possible and uh with delegation and empowerment you can just keep compounding bigger and bigger scale. The other thing that's interesting that we've seen from working with these like power delegators is people assume that uh people of uh great power or wealth or uh resources can afford this team and then that uh is why they have this ambition. But we've actually seen the opposite is the case is as people get more leverage with assistant, their ambition increases. Yeah.</p>
</details>

如果你被 DMV 表格和护照压得喘不过气来，就很难有大的抱负。但一旦这些事情从你身上移开，你就会提高你的眼界，你可以更有抱负，你知道，然后你从助理升级到首席幕僚长，然后你不断升级，直到你成为兰斯代尔或总统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's difficult to have big ambition. If you're just weighed down by DMV forms and passports, but once that's off your plate, then you raise your sights and you can be more ambitious and you know, then you go from assistant to a chief of staff and you just keep leveling up to, you know, until you're lonsdale or the president.</p>
</details>

我欣赏这些人的另一件事是，他们几乎不记仇。你知道，据报道，彼得·蒂尔把埃隆·马斯克踢出了 PayPal，或者你知道，这些人中很多人几十年前都有过“牛肉”（争执）。然而，他最终资助了他的下一家公司。所以人们的记性很短，如果有人对待他们不好，或者他们犯了错误，他们很快就会和解，然后再次做生意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I think another thing I've admired about some of these people is they um you know they remark hold remarkably few grudges like um you know apparently you know Peter Thiel like kicked Elon out of PayPal or something or you know like a lot of these people have had beefs you know decades ago and yet he ended up funding his next company and so people have very short memories if if someone you know mistreats them or they make a mist mistake or something they're quick to reconcile and just do business again over Yeah.</p>
</details>

是的。看看彭斯副总统（President Vance）在成为合作伙伴之前对特朗普总统（President Trump）说了什么。我认为特朗普其实相当宽容，或者你知道，很多人说了很多关于他的坏话，只要他们改变主意，他就会继续与他们合作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean, look what uh President Vance said about President Trump before they were partners. It's I think there's Trump's actually quite forgiving or you know a lot of people say a lot of bad things about him and he'll continue to work with them as long as they change their mind.</p>
</details>

是的。我认为这只是一种不惜一切代价获胜的愿望，是的，记仇是没有帮助的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I think there's just a desire to win uh at all costs and uh yeah, grudges are not helpful.</p>
</details>

即使是特朗普和埃隆，对吧？你们发生争执，然后和解了。到这篇内容发布时，我们看看情况如何。然后有些人似乎拥有非常精简的团队，比如比尔·盖茨有一个相当大的团队，相当大的运营规模。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Even Trump and Elon, right? You getting into it and you know, reconciling, you know, TVD where it stands by by the time this comes out. And and then there are some people who seem to have pretty like uh you know Bill Gates has like you know pretty big team, pretty big operation.</p>
</details>

但后来似乎贝索斯和埃隆的团队可能比较精简。所以，我很想知道你如何看待……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um but then it seemed like Bezos and Elon maybe have like pretty lean and so yeah I'm curious how you think about sort of</p>
</details>

埃隆是那个最不合逻辑的人。他声称没有助理，自己安排日程。有一个关于比尔·盖茨试图与埃隆安排会议的故事，盖茨说：“请让我联系你的助理。”埃隆说：“不，我就是我的助理。”我不太相信，但埃隆就是疯了。所以也许他是那种人。我认为大多数正常人，如果你想获得杠杆，就必须授权。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean Elon's the one that makes no sense. It's he claims to not have an assistant and to be like scheduling stuff. There's a story of Bill Gates being like trying to schedule a meeting with Elon. and he's like, "Connect me with your assistant." And Elon's like, "No, I am my assistant." Uh, it's I I hardly believe it, but Elon's just insane. So maybe he is that that way. I think most normal humans, if you want to get leverage, you have to delegate.</p>
</details>

我看到的一个很酷的个人团队是一个亿万富翁，他经营着一家对冲基金，他有 40 人的团队。他有 8 名个人行政助理。所有这些行政助理都毕业于普林斯顿大学，标准极高。我问管理 EA 团队的一位女士：“你们如何决定优先处理什么任务？”她说：“如果我的团队能为我的负责人节省一分钟时间，那对我们来说就非常值得。”我想，这太高层次了，我肯定希望自己能达到那种水平，但这只是“亿万富翁的预算”。

<p class="english-text">I mean, the one of the cool personal teams I saw is this guy who's a billionaire. He's runs this hedge fund and he has a team of 40. Uh he has eight personal uh executive assistants. The all of the executive assistants graduate from Princeton. insanely high bar. And I was asking this woman who managed the EA team like, "How do you decide what to prioritize your team on?" And she's like, "If my team can spend one day saving my uh principal one minute, it's well worth our time." And I'm like, that is so next level and definitely like that's something I would love to aspire to, but it's just, you know, the the the billionaire budget.</p>

是的，这很有趣。另外，就优先事项而言，我们在这里招聘助理时，有人说：“你希望他们参加你所有的会议吗？”我说：“如果他们参加我的会议，那他们就没在工作了，我希望他们能找到方法为我提供杠杆，并为我分担事务。”

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah, it's pretty funny. Um also just in terms of prioritiz like um you know we're hiring you know assistants here and someone was saying oh you know do you want them to be in all meetings with you and I was like well if they're in meetings with me then they're not working like I want them to be like you know finding ways to give me leverage and take things off my plate.</p>

这是我们在 Athena 的愿景之一，即你可以拥有数字助理，它们可以倾听你并与你合作，连接到你的 Zoom、收件箱和日程表，并可以挖掘所有这些数字“废气”（数字足迹）中助理应该处理的事情。所以，如果助理要完成任何工作，他们不可能参加每一次会议。但如果数字助理——机器助理——正在监测并从中提取任务，那将是一个很酷的组合。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I mean this is one of our visions at Athena is that you can have digital assistants that listen to you and work with you and are connected to your Zoom and your inbox and your calendar and can be mining all of that digital exhaust for things your assistant should work on. And so I mean your assistant can't possibly sit in every meeting if they're going to do anything, but if the digital uh the machine assistants are surveying it and pulling things out, that's a pretty cool combination.</p>

### 组织结构：集中化与碎片化

是的。看看人们如何构建他们的“宇宙”（组织结构）也很有趣。例如，马克·安德森和本·霍洛维茨（Ben Horowitz）将所有内容都通过 a16z 集中起来，他们完全专注于 a16z，当然他们也有其他智力或慈善兴趣，但主要是集中化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. I think it's interesting to look at how people build out their univer like for example, you know, Mark and Ben funnel everything through as Z and are all in on Z and of course have, you know, other intellectual or philanthropic interests, but mostly it's like consolidate.</p>
</details>

而像彼得·蒂尔这样的人，他有点将事情碎片化，你知道，比如 Founders Fund，但也有其他几个基金，其他公司，所有这些举措在某种程度上是协作的，但又是独立的。他坐在顶端，但似乎他也让他们独立运作，他不是它们的 CEO。他拥有一批他长期合作的人才网络，他们几乎会在这整个“宇宙”中来回“回旋”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Whereas someone like Peter Teal has this um he sort of fragments it a bit more you know like um you know founders fund but then other several other you know myith several other funds other company all sorts of like um initiatives that are you know somewhat collaborative but independent. Yeah. Um and he he sits on top but also it seems like he lets them you know he's not like CEO of of of them. Um, and he's got this sort of talent, you know, network that he's worked with for a long time that kind of like, uh, you know, goes in almost boomerangs across the the universe.</p>
</details>

兰斯代尔感觉更像是亲力亲为，他拥有 HBC（High Bar Company，高标准公司）宇宙，但他的其他倡议是，他很快就会将某事制度化，无论是智库还是其他。彼得·蒂尔做蒂尔奖学金（Teal Fellowship）并创建一所大学，这并非巧合。蒂尔几乎是早期进入某个领域的人，他为某事创建了一个格式、一个模板。他做了“领域建设”（field building）的艰苦工作，无论是智力方面，还是做一些有争议的事情，比如长寿或特许城市或高等教育，然后兰斯代尔在一定程度上将其制度化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um lonsdale feels like he's more hands he's got the HBC universe but then his his um other initiative he's like quick to institutionalize something whether it's like a think tank or like you know it's no coincidence that you know Peter Teal would do the sort of teal fellowship and la create a university or something teal is almost like early to stuff he creates a format for something um a template you know he does the hard work of sort of um you know field building intellect or like you know uh doing something that's in a controversial space or it's longevity or charter cities or um you know higher education and then um you know people like Lonsdale institutionalize it to to some degree.</p>
</details>

然后埃隆也被描述为拥有一种“特种部队”（SWAT team）式的团队，他们帮助他从一家公司到另一家公司，他只需招募世界级的人才来领导这些工作。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Um and then yeah Elon you know it's been described also has this like SWAT team um you know of of people that help him from from company to company and he's just able to recruit you know world-class people to to lead these efforts.</p>
</details>

### 适合自己的组织结构

我认为这归结于：正确的组织结构是什么？实际上没有正确的组织结构。正确的组织结构是作为创始人适合你的结构。马克·安德森和本·霍洛维茨是公司建设者，所以他们像建立公司一样建立他们的杠杆。a16z 就是一家公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I think it comes it's like what's the right org structure? There's actually no right or structure. It's what's the right or structure for you as a founder and you know Mark Andreessen and Ben Horowitz are company builders and so they're building their leverage like a company. The A16Z is a company.</p>
</details>

彼得·蒂尔不是企业家，但如今他更像是一位哲学家，所以他的体系更像哲学家：所有这些疯狂的想法。所以我想，英伟达的黄仁勋（Jensen Huang）有 46 个直接下属，这绝对是疯狂的，但对他来说有效。所以我想你只需要了解自己的风格，然后为你量身打造。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh not that Peter Thiel is not an entrepreneur but he's more of a philosopher today and so his uh system is more like a philosopher. It's all these kind of wild and crazy ideas. Uh, and so I think, you know, Jensen Hang has like 46 direct reports or something, which is absolutely insane, but it works for him. And so I think you just have to know what your style is and then you build it for you.</p>
</details>

完全正确。像萨姆·阿尔特曼这样的人是交易撮合者、筹款人和人才识别者。我记得他在 YC（Y Combinator）时，和我一个朋友谈论某种**全民基本收入（Universal Basic Income）**公司。我朋友最终没有做，但我当时想：“嗯，这很有趣。他为什么连这个都在做？”他专注于浪费，而且他……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Totally. And someone like, you know, Sam Alman is like a dealmaker and a fundraiser and a talent identifier, you know, and so he's able to like I remember he was at YC and he was talking to my one of my friends about sort of this universal basic income company. My friend didn't end up doing it, but I was like, "Huh, that's interesting. Why is why is he even doing that?" He's like focused on waste and he's like</p>

### 优势最大化与孵化模式

我认为新创始人，或者至少像我这样的新创始人学到的一件事是：“好吧，我的弱点是什么？我如何才能在这些方面变得更好？”但第二次创业的创始人会说：“忘记我的弱点。我根本不会尝试那些。我只会专注于我的优势，然后雇佣其他人来做我做不好的所有事情。”这要有效得多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean one of the things that I think new founders or at least me as a new founder was like okay what are my weaknesses and how do I get better at them? But then a second time founder is like forget all of my weaknesses. I'm just not even going to try. I'm just going to be really good at my strengths and I'm going to hire other people to do all the things I'm not good at. And that is way more effective.</p>
</details>

是的，完全正确。过去有一种怀疑的声音，认为你不能真正地“孵化”（incubate）一家公司，即 CEO 必须是创始人，他们必须从头开始推动它。你对这种辩论持什么立场？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, totally. The um there used to be this sort of skepticism of like hey you can't really and there still is actually you can't really incubate company like this the CEO has to be the co- the founder they have to drive it to where do you stand on on kind of that that debate.</p>
</details>

我认为最大的公司都不是被孵化的，因为最大的公司都有一个从一开始就“痴迷于单一目标”（monomaniacal）的创始人，并将其复合了 50 年。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the biggest companies aren't incubated because the biggest companies have a founder who is monomaniacal from the beginning and compounds it for 50 years.</p>
</details>

是的，完全正确。那不是孵化。孵化是“让我尝试很多事情”。它不是这种痴迷的幂律承诺。所以，如果你只是想建立一个万亿美元的业务，我认为这不是实现它的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah totally and that's not incubation. incubation is kind of let me uh try a bunch of thing. It's not this monomaniacal power law commitment. So if you're just trying to build a trillion dollar business, I think that's not the way to do it.</p>
</details>

但是，你看，我们有一个共同的朋友，他喜欢保持匿名，他孵化了很多公司，他每年推出四家公司，他喜欢这样做，他会从中赚大钱，这就是他的风格。他可能不会拥有万亿美元的公司，但他将拥有 50 家、一百万美元的公司，这仍然是惊人的，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But look, if you like, you know, we have a mutual friend who likes to remain anonymous who incubates lots of companies and he launches four companies a year and he loves doing it and he's going to make a ton of money doing it and that's just his style. Well, he's not going to probably have trillion dollar businesses, but he's going to have 50, you know, hundred million dollar businesses, which is still incredible, right?</p>
</details>

是的。我认为 OpenAI 某种程度上是萨姆·阿尔特曼孵化的，它不是他当时在做的主业，但一旦他确定这可能是一个巨大的机会，他就全力以赴了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I think one bookcase is more of it's like uh breeding like, you know, Sam Alman in some sense incubated OpenAI and that it wasn't the main thing he was working on, but then once he identified that it could be, you know, this massive opportunity then then went all in all in with it.</p>
</details>

是的。这更像一个风险投资组合，彼得·蒂尔可能做了很多我们甚至不记得的事情，因为它们消失在了以太中，而那些有效的事情则不断复合。所以，如果你有资源启动 10 件新事物，然后每年只在其中一件大事上加倍下注，那是一个很棒的方法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah, I mean it's more like a venture portfolio and you know there's probably a bunch of stuff Peter Teal has done that we don't even remember uh because like sea studying and things like that because they just disappear into the ether and then things that work compound and so yeah I mean if you have the resources to launch 10 new things and then just double down on the one thing that's big every year that's a cool cool approach</p>
</details>

### 挑战默认设置：马克·安德森的日程表哲学

十年前，马克·安德森写了一篇关于生产力的博客文章。他们问他如何看待会议、日程安排等。他说：“你知道吗？我尽量不提前安排事情，因为我不知道下周会有什么感觉，我想按‘心流’（flow）来做事。”所以当人们想约我时，我通常会说：“现在就给我打电话，或者下周再联系我，看看我的感觉如何。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right a decade ago Mark Andreessen wrote this blog post on productivity and they were asking him how you think about you meetings, scheduling, whatever. And he said, "You know what? I try not to schedule things in advance because I don't know how I'll feel, you know, next week and I want kind of want to do things like in flow." And so when, you know, people are trying to get my time, what I typically say is like, "Call me right now or feel free to check in next week and we'll see how I feel."</p>
</details>

这似乎与“心流状态”更好地对齐了。这绝对是终极的“炫耀”（flex）。如果你能做到这一点，那绝对是生活的终极方式，你只是做你想做的事情。世界向你敞开。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it kind of is like better aligned with sort of the flow state. Um, and I mean that's the ultimate flex. It's like if if you can pull that off, that is definitely the ultimate way to live is you just work on whatever you want. The world opens up to you. You call</p>
</details>

显然，这对大多数“凡人”来说很难做到。但如果你能达到那个水平，那就是梦想。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">obviously it's hard for most uh new mortals to pull off. But yeah, if you can get to that level, that is the dream,</p>
</details>

所以，对于那些主动联系我或无论如何都应该尝试的会议，我总是预期几天后我会比现在更忙，或者我有时间。就像现在一样，是的，我有时间。给我打电话。我尝试了一点，然后马克在一次后续采访中被问及此事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">right? So then I I was for certain, you know, meetings that people cold reaching out or whatever. supposed to kind of try. It's It's like um I always anticipate that in a few more days I'll be like busier than I am or something or I'll have whereas like right now, yeah, I got time. Give me a call. Um but so I I tried that a little bit and then I Mark did a follow-up interview uh where someone asked him about that. Sure. Um</p>
</details>

他说：“哦，你知道，那行不通。”我试过了，但那行不通。现在我只是把所有事情都安排得满满当当，一整天都在开会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">um um and he was like, "Oh, you know, that didn't work." Like I I tried but that didn't work. Now I'm just scheduled everything just back toback all day long.</p>
</details>

我说：“哦，该死。你一直在做那个。”而且，你知道，他也掌握了多任务处理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was like, "Oh, god damn it. You've been doing that." Um, and it's um, but he's, you know, he's also mastered uh, multitasking. And</p>
</details>

我认为人们可以从马克和其他人那里学到的是，偶尔挑战一下默认设置。如果你一直开会，就尝试另一种系统，看看是否有效。我认为大多数人只是随波逐流。我认为另一件事是，大多数人不够坚决地拒绝。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, I think people just, uh, the thing I think you can learn from Mark and other people is just, uh, challenge the defaults occasionally. And if you're in back-to-back meetings all the time, try this other system and see see if it works. Uh, I think most people just go with the flow. I think other thing is most people aren't vicious enough at saying no. Yeah.</p>
</details>

只是非常强硬地说：“那个会议对你重要吗？那个随机的、只是为了认识你而进行的聊天有意义吗？”是的，我认为你只需要对大多数事情说不。在 Uber 战争的后期，我记得给洛根（Logan）发了一封邮件问了一个问题，可能是关于来参加我们的晚宴，他只是回复了“战争模式”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And just being super hardcore is like, is that conference you're going to matter? Is that random? get to know you chat mean anything? Yeah, I think you just say no to most things. Um, you know, I've back in the Uber vers uh really scaling war days, I remember emailing Logan a question um probably to come to one of our dinners and he just responded war mode.</p>
</details>

我喜欢那个。我想大多数人都应该 90% 的时间处于战争模式。这种强硬态度就是正确的运作方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I love that. And I'm like, well, most people should actually be in war mode like 90% of the time. And that same hardcornness is just like the right way to operate.</p>

### 应对压力与认知失调

在你丰富的创始人职业生涯中学到了什么关于管理自己的心理、应对压力、应对认知失调——比如你必须在外部表现得一切都很棒，即使你担心谷歌可能会扼杀你的业务？你对培养这种能力有什么建议？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What have you learned in your extensive founder career about uh managing your own psychology, dealing with stress, dealing with the cognitive dissonance of, you know, having to present externally like things are amazing even when, you know, you're concerned about Google, you know, taking out your business. Um what um what advice might you have for others in terms of cultivating this?</p>
</details>

是的，伙计。我认为这就像“冷水浴”之类的，就是电击疗法，最终你会一直沐浴在存在的恐惧中，然后你会想：“随便吧，放马过来。”完全正确。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah, man. I think it's like a cold plunge or something. It's just you just shock therapy and eventually you it's just like you're bathed in existential fear all the time and you're like whatever, let's bring it on. Totally. Uh</p>
</details>

我不认为还有别的，除了知道这会发生。会有很多起伏。我认为从 Thumbtac 得出的一个明确教训是，它现在已经发展壮大并取得了如此大的成功，有很多“差点就死了”的时刻，我们以为它行不通了。你只需要留在游戏中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think there's there's much other than knowing that it's going to happen. There's going to be tons of ups and downs. I think one of the clear lessons from Thumbtac, which is now scaled and and done so well, was that like there was lots of near misses where we almost died times where we thought it wasn't going to work. And it's like you just got to stay in the game. Yeah.</p>
</details>

如果你能留在游戏中，你最终就能赢。我认为 Thumbtac 在留在游戏中方面做得非常好，这样我们最终就能赢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if you can stay in the game, you can eventually win. Yeah. And I think Thumbtac was very good at staying in the game so that we can eventually win.</p>

很有趣。一开始有不同程度的恐慌。你刚开始涉足时，你会想：“天哪，有人在网上说了我一句难听的话。”然后你会想：“天哪，有人想离开我的公司。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um Yeah. It's funny. There's like degrees of panic in the beginning. You know, you're getting your feet wet. It's like, "Oh my god, someone said something mean about me on the internet. And then it's like, "Oh my god, someone wants to like leave my company."</p>
</details>

然后你会想：“天哪，我们可能要倒闭了。我们只有六个月的工资可以发。”然后你会想：“天哪，我们要被起诉了。”

<details>

<p class="english-text">And then it's like, "Oh my god, um, we're, you know, we might die. We only six months of payroll." Then it's like, "Oh my we're going to get sued."</p>
</details>

就像你第一次被起诉或担心被起诉一样，最终你会召开董事会会议，那里有一份诉讼清单，你只是每季度回顾一下。成功就是这样：你会不断遇到这些事情，它就成了业务的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like, you know, well, it's like the first time you get sued or you're worried about getting sued and then eventually you have a board meeting and there's just a list of lawsuits and it's just you revict them quarterly. It's just like that's actually what success is is like you're gonna have that stuff constantly and it becomes Yeah. Just part of business.</p>
</details>

是的。你不断建立更多的能力来处理这些事情，你知道的。

### Athena 与人机融合

让我们转向 Athena，回到我们开始的地方，也就是人类和 AI 的交集。考虑到 AI 的发展，你如何思考构建 Athena？这对 Athena 意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's go to Athena and let's go where we started, which is sort of the intersection between uh humans and AI. How have you thought about building Athena given sort of developments in AI and what does that mean for for Athena</p>
</details>

Athena 最初完全是自筹资金，只依靠人力，发展到一千人，没有外部资本。几年前我们迎来了 AI 时刻，很明显我们可以进行一次重大的 AI 布局，这可能成为一代人的事业，否则我们可能会被 AI 淘汰。所以只有一个选择：全力以赴。我们这里的愿景是：你将人类和机器的优点结合到一个统一的产品中。机器所做的工作会随着时间推移而增加，就像自动驾驶汽车一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">started fully bootstrapped human only scaled to a thousand people no outside capital and then we had this AI moment a few years ago and it was clear we could uh make a big AI play and this could become a generational business or we could get railroaded by AI and so only one option there is go big and uh our vision here is this uh is you take the best of a human and best of a machine wrap it into one unified product and what the machine does will increase over time just like a self-driving car and so</p>
</details>

人类负责用户体验（UX），它在顶层。人类助理将更多地专注于项目管理和高层次的工作，真正成为那种照料者、同理心、伙伴的角色。然后机器将越来越多地处理更机械、更行政性的事务。就像你进入特斯拉时一样，埃隆（Elon）开始时给它们装了方向盘，所以你可以驾驶它们，因为它们不会自己驾驶。但每次你上车时，你实际上都在教机器如何驾驶。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the humans the UX it's on top uh it will become more the human assistant will focus more on project management and highle uh work uh and really be that like caretaker that empathy that partner and then the machine will increasingly do the more row mechanical administrative stuff and you know just as when you get into a Tesla, uh, you know, Elon made them with wheels, so with steering wheels, so you could drive them because they don't drive themselves, uh, when he started, but every time you get in the car, you're actually teaching the machine how to drive. Yeah.</p>
</details>

这些模型泛化能力不强。你必须将边缘案例纳入分布中。所以每次你驾驶时，模型就会变得更强大。在行政助理领域也是如此。我们的人类在驾驶，他们在执行任务，但我们正在构建的机器模型正通过他们的行为得到改进。因此，你的助理为你执行的任务越多，我们的模型就会改进越多，这将允许人类将他们所做的工作升级到更高杠杆的事情上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And these models don't, uh, generalize well. You have to bring edge cases under distribution. And so every time you drive, the uh, the model gets more powerful. And the same is true in um, executive assistant. Our humans are driving. They're doing the tasks, but we're building machine models that are being improved by the way they act. And so the more your assistant does tasks for you, the more our models will improve and that'll allow the human to upgrade what they they work on to more high leverage stuff.</p>
</details>

### 雇佣助理的实用路径

这很令人兴奋。你还能分享哪些关于公司推广、需要注意的事项，或者对于想获得助理的人来说，有什么可以分享的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Um that's exciting. So what what else uh can you share about plugs for the company or things to watch out for or for people who you know want to get assistance, you know? Yeah, look it uh I</p>
</details>

我只想说，如果你没有助理，你就是那个助理。第一步，如果你在创业，你应该雇佣助理。如果你每月有 20 美元，就使用 ChatGPT。如果你有每小时 10 美元，就去 Upwork 自己雇人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">just say if you don't have an assistant, you are the assistant. Step one, uh if you're starting a business, you should hire assistant. And if you've got 20 bucks a month, use Chat GPT. Yeah. If</p>
</details>

如果你自己雇佣一个人，我会说我的主要建议是你需要面试很多人。你知道，Athena 每月有 5 万名助理申请，我们让他们通过大量的测试，我们每 300 人中只雇佣一个。所以，如果你要自己雇佣，请确保你面试的不是 10 个人，而是大约 50 个人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you've got, you know, 10 bucks an hour, go on to Upwork and hire someone yourself. Uh if you hire someone yourself, I would say my main recommendation is you need to interview a lot of people. Uh you know, Athena, we have 50,000 assistants apply per month and we put them through a huge battery of tests and we hire like one in 300. So, if you're going to hire on yourself, make sure you interview not 10, but probably like 50 people.</p>
</details>

如果你有能力支付每月 3000 美元，那么你就应该与 Athena 这样的公司合作，他们可以为你招聘、培训、管理并教你如何授权。然后当你拥有雇佣现场助理的资源时，每年 10 万到 15 万美元，你也应该这样做。最后，你知道，当你进入后期阶段时，你拥有一个首席幕僚长、一个现场助理，以及一队在云端的 Athena 助理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, if you have the resources for $3,000 a month, then you should work with a company like Athena who can recruit, train, manage, and teach you how to delegate. And then when you have the resources for an in-person assistant, uh, 100 150k a year, you should do that as well. Um, and then ultimately, you know, when you get later stage, you have a chief of staff, inerson assistant, and, you know, a fleet of Athena assistants in the cloud.</p>
