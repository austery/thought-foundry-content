### 揭秘多囊卵巢综合征：一种被误解的普遍疾病

**Nam Kiwanuka:** 您正在收听《误诊》（Mistreated）。我是Nam Kiwanuka。您可能听说过**PCOS**（Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome: 多囊卵巢综合征）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You're listening to Mistreated. I'm Nam Kiwanuka. You might have heard of PCOS.</p>
</details>

这是一个缩写，代表多囊卵巢综合征，一种影响140万加拿大人的疾病。在全球范围内，它影响着八分之一的女性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's an acronym that stands for polycystic ovarian syndrome, a condition that affects 1.4 million Canadians. And globally, it impacts one in eight women.</p>
</details>

这种疾病在90多年前就被发现，但至今没有单一的治疗药物。它的确切病因不明，无法治愈，并且人们对其知之甚少。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">For a condition that was identified just over 90 years ago, there's no one medication to treat it. The exact cause of it is unknown. It's not curable, and it is poorly understood.</p>
</details>

一些专家认为，PCOS至少是两到三种不同疾病的集合，目前正有人呼吁将其分离为两种不同的诊断。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some experts say PCOS looks to be at least two or three different conditions that have been lumped together and there are calls for it to be separated into two different diagnoses.</p>
</details>

另一些人则认为“多囊卵巢综合征”这个名称具有误导性，应该更改。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Others say the name polycystic ovarian syndrome is misleading and that the name should be changed.</p>
</details>

根据学术和研究社区的独立在线出版物《对话》（The Conversation）的报道，患有PCOS的女性在一生中经历负面健康结果的可能性比一般人群高出20%到40%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">According to reporting from The Conversation, an independent online publication from the academic and research community, women with PCOS are 20 to 40% more likely to experience negative health outcomes during their lifetime than the general population.</p>
</details>

这包括患**高血压**（hypertension）、**肾病**（kidney disease）、**饮食失调**（eating disorders）、**抑郁症**（depression）、**焦虑症**（anxiety）和**胃肠道疾病**（gastrointestinal disease）的风险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This includes risks of developing hypertension, kidney disease, eating disorders, depression, anxiety, and gastrointestinal disease.</p>
</details>

它还与**不孕症**（infertility）和**流产**（miscarriage）有关，患有PCOS的女性常会经历盆腔和腹部疼痛。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's also been associated with infertility and miscarriage, and it's common for women with it to experience pelvic and abdominal pain.</p>
</details>

患有PCOS的女性患**2型糖尿病**（type 2 diabetes）的可能性也高出两到三倍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Women with PCOS are also two to three times more likely to have type 2 diabetes.</p>
</details>

当PCOS症状被忽视或误诊时，女性患**心力衰竭**（heart failure）和**中风**（stroke）的风险也会更高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And when PCOS symptoms are missed or misdiagnosed, it also puts women at higher risk of heart failure and stroke.</p>
</details>

每个人的表现都独一无二。这可能就是为什么70%的PCOS女性仍未被诊断出来的原因之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And every person has a unique presentation. And that might be part of the reason why 70% of women who have it remain undiagnosed.</p>
</details>

我们今天的嘉宾将其描述为像指纹一样，每个人的病情和需求都略有不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And our guest today describes it like a fingerprint where every person's condition and every person's needs are a little different.</p>
</details>

Andrea Lewis是一位演员兼制片人。您可能因为她在《迪格拉西：下一代》（Degrassi the Next Generation）中饰演Hazel而认识她。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Andrea Lewis is an actor and producer. You might recognize her from her role as Hazel on Degrassi the Next Generation.</p>
</details>

她于2012年被诊断出患有PCOS。她一直公开谈论自己的诊断以及与PCOS共存的经历，并一直为PCOS患者发声。她现在加入了我们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">She was diagnosed with PCOS in 2012. She's been open about talking about her diagnosis and what it's like to live with it. And she's been an advocate for those with it. She joins me now.</p>
</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka:** 嗨，Andrea Lewis。欢迎来到播客。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Hi, Andrea Lewis. Welcome to the podcast.</p>
</details>

**Andrea Lewis:** 谢谢，谢谢您的邀请。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Thank you. Thank you for having me.</p>
</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka:** 我很高兴能和您交谈，因为我是您工作的粉丝，尤其是您现在正在做的魅力文化（glam culture）方面的工作。所以，恭喜您。我还想和您谈谈PCOS，因为您已经谈论这个话题很长一段时间了。Andrea，您能给我们一个关于PCOS的定义吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I'm so excited to be able to speak to you. Um because I'm a fan of the work that you're doing, especially with like glam culture right now. So, congratulations on that. Um, I w also wanted to talk to you about PCOS because this is something that you've been talking about for a while. Andrea, can you give us a definition of what it is?</p>
</details>

**Andrea Lewis:** PCOS的全称是多囊卵巢综合征。但PCOS是一种**代谢紊乱**（metabolic disorder）和**激素紊乱**（hormonal disorder）。它影响着北美和英国大约十分之一的女性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Polycystic ovarian syndrome is is what it breaks down into. Um, but PCOS is a metabolic disorder and a hormonal disorder. It affects about I'd say maybe one in 10 women across North America and in the UK.</p>
</details>

它本质上影响您的生殖健康。因此，PCOS可以通过多种方式影响您，但通常是通过卵巢上长出小囊肿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is something that essentially affects your reproductive health. So, there's a very there's a various amount of ways that you can kind of be affected by PCOS, but typically it is by having little cysts on um your ovaries.</p>
</details>

它通常会导致月经不规律，但也会影响体重增加、**睾酮水平**（testosterone levels）以及女性的多种毛发生长方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It usually causes you to have irregular periods, but this can also affect weight gain. This can affect um your testosterone levels. This affects um hair growth in many different ways for women.</p>
</details>

但同样，这些都是它的变体。所以我认识的每个女性患PCOS的方式都非常不同。它真的非常像指纹。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But again, these are kind of variants of it. So, every woman I know has it in a very different way. they they it it honestly behaves a lot like a fingerprint.</p>
</details>

它也是许多女性不孕症的主要原因，女性常常在尝试怀孕遇到困难时才被诊断出来，然后才发现自己患有PCOS。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's also kind of the leading cause of um infertility in a lot of women in and and women are often diagnosed kind of later on when they realize they're going they're trying for a child and they're having a really hard time with it and then they discovered like oh they actually have PCOS.</p>
</details>

### 个人诊断历程与医疗系统困境

**Nam Kiwanuka:** 我想问您是如何发现自己患有PCOS的。您去看医生时感觉如何，因为那是在2012年，对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I wanted to ask you how you discovered that you had PCOS. How were you feeling when you went to the doctor because this is way back I think in 2012. Yeah, 2012 is when I 2012 is when I got diagnosed, but I'd say I probably had it before that because um I I always recall I had like a year where I I don't even remember my period actually coming.</p>
</details>

**Andrea Lewis:** 是的，我是在2012年被诊断出来的，但我可能在那之前就患有PCOS了，因为我记得有一年我甚至不记得月经来过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, 2012 is when I 2012 is when I got diagnosed, but I'd say I probably had it before that because um I I always recall I had like a year where I I don't even remember my period actually coming.</p>
</details>

那时我还年轻，而且你知道，至少在我成长的过程中，月经健康并没有被视为我们应该关心的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um but I was younger and and you know, period health is um when when I was growing up at least, it was not treated as something that we should care about.</p>
</details>

它被视为一种禁忌。你不会真正谈论它。所以当我真正被诊断出PCOS时，是因为我当时正在谈恋爱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It was treated more like taboo. It was like you didn't really talk about it. And so when I was truly diagnosed with PCOS, it was because I was in a relationship at the time.</p>
</details>

我记得我就是不来月经。很明显，我当时有性生活，因为我在恋爱中。我知道我没有怀孕，但我就是不来月经。它就是不来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I remember I just wasn't getting my period. And obviously I was sexually active because I was in a relationship. I knew I was not pregnant, but I just was not getting my period. It just was not coming.</p>
</details>

当时我正与体重作斗争，也与整体心理健康作斗争，只是觉得这有很多其他因素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And at the time I was struggling with my weight. I was struggling with my overall mental health and and just kind of thinking it was a lot of other factors.</p>
</details>

我去看医生，我说：“我没有来月经。”我记得当时他直接给了我**避孕药**（birth control），他说：“等你来月经时就服用这个，它会让你的月经规律。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I went to my doctor. I said, "I'm not getting my period." And I remember at the time he literally gave me birth control and he was like when you do get it just take this and it will just make it regular.</p>
</details>

我记得当时的感觉是：“但我没来月经啊。那我什么时候才能服用这个避孕药呢？”当时我确实没有服用，因为我的月经最终没有来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I remember feeling like but I'm not getting it. So like will I ever get to take this birth control? And I honestly did not at the time because my period did not end up coming.</p>
</details>

我记得我又去找他，那时他才最终给我安排了一些专科医生的预约。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I remember going back to him and that's when he eventually set me up with some appointments with some specialists.</p>
</details>

我看了两三个不同的专科医生，他们都有非常不同的……我猜是**医德**（bedside manner），在护理程度上也不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I went to maybe two or three different specialists and they all had very different um I guess bedside manner is what I'll call it like in degrees of care.</p>
</details>

我记得去看一个医生，他基本上就是说：“你必须减肥，然后月经就会来。”我当时想：“哦，好吧。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because I remember going to one who was just basically like you have to lose weight and um and then it will just kind of come and I was like oh okay and and it was like always everybody was like you'll struggle to um conceive.</p>
</details>

每个人都说：“你将很难怀孕。”然后我去了另一个医生那里，他说：“哦，别担心，你还年轻，它会自己好起来的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then I went to another that was like oh don't worry about it you're young it'll figure itself out.</p>
</details>

最后，我找到了一位也专攻PCOS的营养师，她可能是第一个真正让我觉得“哦，我能管理好这件事。我能解决好这件事”的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then finally at the time I found a nutritionist who also specialized in PCOS and she was probably the first person who really made me feel like oh I can manage this thing. I can figure this thing out.</p>
</details>

但我感受到了所有的情绪。我感到有点尴尬。我感到很多羞耻。我对此感到困惑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I I felt all the emotions. I felt a bit embarrassed. I felt a lot of shame. I I felt confused with it.</p>
</details>

我真的被应该吃什么或不吃什么，应该如何运动或不运动所困扰。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was really challenged by what you were supposed to eat or not eat. By the way you were supposed to exercise or not exercise.</p>
</details>

因为再次强调，重点是减肥，但它是一种激素紊乱。所以如果你的激素失衡，体重问题就是你正在经历的一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because again, the emphasis is on lose weight, which it's a hormonal disorder. So if your hormonal if your hormones are out of whack, weight challenges are like that's all you're experiencing.</p>
</details>

你体重增加，你体重减轻，你的体重没有变化。这就是当你面临激素挑战时会发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You're gaining weight, you're losing weight, you're not moving with your weight. That's the that's what happens when you have a hormonal challenge.</p>
</details>

所以，无论是PCOS患者还是非PCOS患者，每当我遇到有人告诉我他们的激素有问题时，我总是能完全理解他们的处境，因为它影响了我们生活的许多方面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so anybody whether you have PCOS or not, whenever I meet somebody and they tell me like, "Oh, their their hormones are the issue." I'm always like I I completely can empathize with where they are at because it affects so many parts of our lives and feeling very out of control in your body is a big thing with PCOS.</p>
</details>

感觉身体失控是PCOS的一个大问题。所以，当他们强调减肥时，女性往往会非常努力地减肥，比如：“哦，我必须做高强度训练。我必须什么都不吃。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So oftentimes when they emphasize like lose weight, the women tend to go really hard on on weight loss, like it's like, oh, I have to do highintensity workouts. I I have to be not eating anything.</p>
</details>

而这实际上会让你受影响更大。压力太大了。所以，实际上，PCOS之所以如此具有挑战性，是因为它需要非常低的压力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that actually affects you even more. That is too stressful. So, in truth, why PCS is so challenging is because it's it's something that requires really low stress. Like,</p>
</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka:** 我想多谈谈这一点，但我想回到您刚才说的一件事。为什么当您发现自己患有PCOS时，会感到尴尬和羞耻？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I want to talk more about that, but I want to go back to something that you said. Um, why did you feel embarrassed and ashamed when you found out that you had PCOS?</p>
</details>

**Andrea Lewis:** 我想是因为，你知道，任何与生殖健康有关，听起来与其他人不同的事情，听起来与你的朋友不同的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, I think because you're you're you know, I think anything that is uh when it comes to reproductive health that sounds different to other people, like that sounds different to your friends.</p>
</details>

就像我说的，在我成长的过程中，月经是以最基本的方式被教导的。就像：“好吧，既然你来月经了，你随时都可能怀孕，你会有**经前综合征**（PMS），脾气会很差。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's like, yeah, like I said, when I was growing up, your period was taught in like the most basic way. It was like, okay, now that you have your period, you can get pregnant at any at any given moment, and you're going to have PMS and just like a bad attitude or something like that.</p>
</details>

所以要处理月经不规律的问题，即使你试图像周围所有其他女性一样正常生活，或者你可能在生育方面遇到挑战，诸如此类的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so to kind of deal with something that your period is not coming on a regular basis even though you are trying to function like every other woman around you or that maybe you are going to have a challenge to have a child things like that.</p>
</details>

更重要的是，你的身体感觉不像自己的。你体重增加。你总是感到非常悲伤，或者非常抑郁，或者非常焦虑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then on top of that like that your body is not feeling like it's your own. You're you're gaining this weight. You're feeling really sad all the time or really depressed or really anxious.</p>
</details>

而且知道这与某种听起来像是编造出来的事情有关。我有一个患有PCOS的朋友，她体重问题很严重。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and to know that it has to deal do with this thing that almost sounds made up to people. I I had a friend who had PCOS and she was had really challenges with her weight.</p>
</details>

我记得和她妈妈谈论这件事，说我也和她一样，她妈妈竟然说：“哦，我其实不觉得那是真的。我只是觉得我女儿吃了太多糖果，所以她一直体重增加。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I remember um talking to her mom about it and saying that I too had the same thing as her and her mom literally said, "Oh, I didn't actually think it was real. I actually just thought my daughter was eating too much candy. That's why she kept gaining weight."</p>
</details>

我当时想：“哦，不。这是非常真实的。”所以我想我是我们家族这一代第一个经历PCOS的女性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I was like, "Oh, no. It's it's it's very real." And and so I think I'm the first woman in my generation of my family to experience it.</p>
</details>

我的妈妈没有，比我大的表姐妹没有，我的祖母也没有。也许她们有不同程度的PCOS，但我是第一个被诊断出来并患有这种疾病的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it's like my mom didn't have it. My cousins that are older than me didn't have it. My grandmother didn't have it. And maybe they do have a uh degrees of it, but I'm the first one to like be diagnosed and like have it.</p>
</details>

所以在这个过程中你感到非常孤独，这会让你感到羞耻，因为你的身体没有按照人们告诉你的女性应该有的方式运作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you feel very alone in the process, which can feel uh shameful that you're just not your body is not functioning the way people tell you women are supposed to function.</p>
</details>

他们会说你应该锻炼，不应该吃你正在吃的任何导致你出现问题的食物。但通常情况并非如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That like you're that you should be just working out and not eating whatever you're eating. that's causing you to have this problem. And often times it's not that.</p>
</details>

它要复杂得多，而且人们不一定会对此抱有同情心。所以，是的，我记得刚开始的时候，就像我说的，我当时在谈恋爱，我曾经觉得这些症状听起来像是假的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's like it's so many more things. It's so complex and um and people are not necessarily uh empathetic to it. And and so yeah, at first I remember when I had it and and like I said, I was in a relationship, I used to feel like the symptoms sounded fake.</p>
</details>

就像：“嗯，她可能因为PCOS而非常悲伤。哦，她只是因为PCOS而没有减肥。或者她不应该吃巧克力，因为她有PCOS。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It was like, well, she could be really sad because she has PCOS. Oh, well, she's just not losing any weight because she has PCOS. Or she shouldn't eat that chocolate because she has PCOS.</p>
</details>

这听起来不像人们能真正理解的事情，尤其因为，你知道，它没有物理上的表现，对吧？它是一种内在的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's just like it just didn't sound like something that people could really get behind, especially because, you know, it doesn't have like the you don't wear the physical issue on it, right? It's something that's so inside.</p>
</details>

我记得有一次去看医生，告诉护士我患有PCOS，她说：“你看起来不像患有PCOS的人。你一点都不像。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I remember having a doctor's appointment um and going in and telling the nurse that I had PCOS and she was like, "You don't look like somebody that has PCOS. You don't look like that at all."</p>
</details>

我当时想：“哦，那它看起来像什么？”通常，就像我说的，他们会对其进行刻板印象。他们认为：“哦，你应该肥胖，或者你应该体型更大。你应该就是那样。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I was like, "Oh, well, what does it like look like?" And and often times, like I said, they kind of stereotype it. They think, "Oh, well, you're supposed to be obese or you're supposed to be larger. You're supposed to be something like that."</p>
</details>

然后，对于那些体型确实较大的女性，他们又不会同情她们。他们会说：“哦，不，不可能是PCOS让你这么胖。肯定是别的原因。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then women who really do have like a larger body mass, they are now not empathetic with those women. They're like, "Oh, well, no, it can't be PCOS that's got you this size. It has to be something else."</p>
</details>

所以，这非常……我发现PCOS社区之外的人不一定理解你正在处理的问题。而且这只是最近才有所改变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, it's very it it has like I I don't find that people outside of the PCOS community necessarily understand what it is that you're dealing with. And it's only kind of very recently.</p>
</details>

我有一个朋友最近和我谈论PCOS，说他妻子最近被诊断出来，所以他正在做很多研究和学习。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I had a friend who recently had a conversation with me about PCOS saying that his wife was recently diagnosed and so he was doing a lot of research and learning about it.</p>
</details>

但就像，是的，我们现在是2025年。我被诊断出来是在2012年。不，我当时并没有感受到人们对此有多么同情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But like, yeah, we're in 2025. When I was diagnosed, it was 2012. And no, I did not experience people being that empathetic to it.</p>
</details>

我仍然在努力理解，像PCOS这样严重的疾病，竟然被称为“懒惰女孩病”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I'm still like trying to process someone like something being called something as serious as PCOS being called the lazy girl disease because</p>
</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka:** 嗯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> um</p>
</details>

**Andrea Lewis:** 如果你患有PCOS，你就有患高血压、肾病、饮食失调、抑郁症、焦虑症、胃肠道疾病的风险，以及你刚才提到的不孕症、流产。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> if you have PCOS you're at risk of developing hypertension kidney disease uh eating disorders, depression, anxiety, gastrointestinal disease um along with what you were talking about infertility, uh miscarriage.</p>
</details>

此外，患有PCOS的女性患2型糖尿病的可能性也高出两到三倍，还会经历心力衰竭和中风。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">also women with PCOS are also two to three times more likely to have type do diabetes um experience heart failure and stroke.</p>
</details>

这与你早上能否慢跑5英里，或者你是否会坐在沙发上吃一袋薯片，毫无关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This has nothing to do with whether or not you can jog 5 miles in the morning or not or you're going to sit on the couch and eat a bag of chips.</p>
</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka:** 是的。没错，绝对是这样。这就是不幸之处，因为我认为如果人们花更多时间了解自己的家族史。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. No, absolutely right. And that's what's unfortunate because I think as well if people took a little bit more time to understand even their own family history.</p>
</details>

在我的家族中，无论是妈妈还是爸爸那边，都有糖尿病史。所以当我最终理解这一点时，我当时想：“哦，我的PCOS是家族糖尿病的直接结果。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So within my family both on my mom and my dad's side is diabetes. And so when I eventually kind of understood that, I was like, "Oh, well, my PCOS is is a direct result of the diabetes that's in my family."</p>
</details>

所以，是的，这与我能否跑步，能否不跑步，所有这些事情都毫无关系。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>

去年我与某人交谈，他们告诉我他们为纽约马拉松训练过，而且他们患有PCOS。他们说：“我为马拉松训练，可能只减了一磅。”

<p class="english-text">I had a conversation with somebody last year telling me that they trained for the New York Marathon and they have PCOS. They were like, I I probably lost one pound in my training for a marathon.</p>

普通人，我猜那些身体完全正常运作的人，不会经历这种情况。他们会经历更多的体重减轻。他们的身体会经历更多的变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">your average I get I guess your your average person whose body let's say functions completely normally would not experience that. They would experience more weight loss. They would experience their body, you know, going through more changes.</p>
</details>

但患有PCOS的女性可能真的做对了所有事情，却仍然看不到身体有任何真正的变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But a PCOS woman could truly be doing all the things right and still not see any real change to their body.</p>
</details>

所以很多时候，我认为你必须将其视为：“好吧，我做这些是为了我的心理健康。我做这些是因为它给我带来快乐。我做这些是因为它让我感觉良好。”而不是担心你的身体会改变或不会改变。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So oftent times um I think you have to process it as like well I'm doing these things for my mental health. I'm doing these things because it brings me joy.

</details>

因为如果你将自己与朋友或周围的人比较，你只会发现自己非常沮丧。而我终于在处理自己的PCOS时达到了那种状态。

<p class="english-text">Um because if you're comparing yourself to say your friends or the people around you, you'll just find yourself very frustrated and and I'm finally in that kind of place when it comes to my own PCOS.</p>

但我只是意识到，对于局外人来说，理解生殖健康的重要性以及经历PCOS、**子宫内膜异位症**（endometriosis）、**子宫肌瘤**（fibroids）等问题的人们如何在这个世界上生活，确实很难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I just realized I'm like it is hard for people on the outside looking in to understand the importance of reproductive health and the and the ways that that people who um experience these things PCOS, endometriosis, fibroids, anything like that, the way that we are navigating through the world, it's it's not um</p>

是的，这并不像人们想象的那么容易。世界卫生组织（WHO）表示，高达70%的PCOS女性甚至不知道自己患有PCOS。

<p class="english-text">yeah, it's not so easy as people would like to think. Um, the WHO uh says that uh up to 70% of women with PCOS don't even know that they have PCOS.</p>
</details>

我想回到您第一次和医生谈话的时候，您说您可能在2012年之前就患有PCOS。当我患有子宫肌瘤时，以及我的朋友们患有子宫内膜异位症时，当我们交谈时，我们是相反的情况。

<details>

<p class="english-text">U I want to go back to when you first were talking to your doctor and you said you probably had it before 2012. Um when I had fibroids and u my friends with endometriosis when I speak to them we are the opposite.</p>

我们出血很多，而医生……

<p class="english-text">>> the common thing is like oh it's just a period um you know just take some Tylenol and you know buy some extra pads it's just a period.

<p class="english-text">And it's like, "But I'm not I'm not getting it." And so some this needs to be taken a little bit more serious.</p>

<p class="english-text">And just like you said, I have met before women who would tell me they weren't getting their period on a regular basis or it was very irregular or something and I'd say, "Oh, you should probably get that looked at. That sounds like PCOS."</p>

但我总是回到我说的，在我成长的过程中，我记得在七年级或六年级。我记不清是哪个年级了，但我们在学校里有过关于月经的谈话。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I always go back to, like I said, when I was growing up and I I can remember being in grade seven or six. I can't remember one of those grades, but like the the period conversation that we had at school and it was literally like a bunch of young girls and they take us to the side and they kind of tell us, "All right, yeah, you can get pregnant now. You might have P PMS and you should have pass."</p>
</details>

他们把一群小女孩带到一边，告诉我们：“好吧，是的，你现在可以怀孕了。你可能会有经前综合征，你应该通过。”就像，砰，砰，砰。就这些事情。

<p class="english-text">>> Check mark, check mark, check mark. Yeah. And like, okay, done. Go off, girls.</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I remember too, like because, you know, at that time, it it it was almost like a it has a little bit of a badge of honor of being like, oh, I'm growing up as a little girl.</p>
</details>

你知道，当你12岁、11岁、13岁，当你处于那个年龄段，你开始来月经。我记得我的朋友们说：“我来了，我来了。”

<details>

<p class="english-text">You know, when you're 12, when you're 11, you're 13, when you're those ages and you're kind of getting your period. And I remember my friends like, I got mine and I got mine and a couple of us within the school year.</p>

我们学校里有几个人都这样。然后那些没有来月经的人，现在回想起来，我想：“哦，她们当时一定感到很焦虑，想着，你知道，我的月经会不会来？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the ones that didn't now in hindsight I'm like oh they must have felt a lot of anxiety thinking you know oh is mine coming or not coming.</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and so yeah I find that the idea of what a period is supposed to be for women that I read that it's like it's supposed to be the report card.</p>

所以，我有一个最好的朋友，我们几年前住在一起，她患有子宫肌瘤。我总是说：“是的，在这个家里，我们一个人的月经太多，另一个人的月经没有。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I I have a best friend that we used to live together years ago and she has fibroids. And I always used to say I was like, "Yes, in this house, one of us has too much period and the other has no period because she experienced all the things um with her fibroids."</p>
</details>

因为她经历了所有与子宫肌瘤有关的事情。我当时想，我简直不敢相信我们也在努力寻找快乐，尽管我们的身体以这种对我们来说非常困难和具有挑战性的方式运作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I just and and I was like, I can't even believe that we we are also trying to find joy knowing that our bodies were functioning in this way that was really hard for us and really challenging and we were both every single day just trying to kind of manage through it.</p>

<p class="english-text">But I'm like, she's having to bring an extra pair of pants with her somewhere because she may bleed out of her pants.</p>

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I'm fighting for my life just to get like a period to come on a regular basis.</p>

所以，是的，我认为人们，我总是说：“我希望有人在我们13岁的时候告诉我们，这可能是会发生的事情之一，你应该整体考虑你的身体以及它应该如何运作，每一件小事都很重要，值得谈论。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, yeah, I think people and I always say I'm like, I wish that somebody had told us when we were 13 years old that this is one of the things that could possibly happen, that you should be thinking about your body overall and how it should be uh working and that every little thing is something that is important to talk about like and I wish that a doctor took me more seriously at the time, but I remember feeling yeah, incredibly frustrated um because it really depends um on I guess even their own level.</p>

我希望当时医生能更认真地对待我，但我记得当时感到非常沮丧，因为这真的取决于，我想，甚至他们自己的水平。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And so I think maybe there was something with that and why they just kind of like kind of dismissed the issue versus seeing it as like, oh, hey, this is something to call out.</p>

<p class="english-text">Mind you, it's like I was much younger and like I said where the idea um of periods in my life, the way it was taught was like, oh, if if a period's not coming, you're pregnant.</p>

### 打破沉默：PCOS倡导与自我关怀

**Nam Kiwanuka:** 您为什么决定再次公开谈论PCOS？因为您是在一个非常……当时，即使在2025年，月经疼痛的污名仍然存在，但当您开始谈论它时，很少有人谈论任何与女性事务有关的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> How did you why did you decide to speak up again about PCOS? because you did it at a time when very again the the stigma is still around period pain now in 2025 but when you started to talk about it not very many people were talking about anything that had to do like with women's business</p>
</details>

**Andrea Lewis:** 是的，你知道吗，我想这真的只是因为我总是觉得我需要一点宽容。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> yeah you know what I I think it was honestly just because I always felt like I needed a little bit of grace.</p>
</details>

我想作为一个从事面向公众行业的人，我是一名艺人，我从小就在娱乐业工作，施加在艺人、特别是女演员身上的压力，无论是体重、快乐，还是仅仅是持续追求一个非常艰难的行业。

<details>

</details>

我总是觉得，首先，这非常艰难。所以，这本身就是一个挑战，但如果再加上你面临生殖挑战，你正在处理激素问题，代谢挑战，就会觉得：“哦，如果我能随便谈论任何事情，PCOS自然而然地就出现了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I always felt like one, this is very hard. So, um, that was a challenge for me in itself, but then to also add in there that you had a reproductive challenge, that you had something hormonally that you were dealing with, a metabolic challenge, it just felt like, oh, if I could talk about anything kind of casually, PCOS just naturally came up.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because I felt like, oh, I I need to explain why I need some grace. if you see any changes or if you don't or if you do is because I'm also navigating this thing.</p>

我想也是因为我不太常看到这个话题的讨论，我总是这样想。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And um and I think also because I didn't really see it the conversation that often and um and I always think about it like that.</p>
</details>

如果有什么是你正在寻找但没有看到太多讨论的，那可能就轮到你开始谈论它了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like if that there's something that you're looking up and you're not really seeing a lot um it's probably it's probably your turn to start to talk about it.</p>

我记得当时我只是找到了一些论坛，那些论坛非常令人悲伤。所有女性都在谈论她们感到多么抑郁，或者她们的身体，或者她们正在努力生孩子，或者她们非常震惊，就像：“哦，天哪，我的未来10年、20年或15年将会是这样。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I remember at the time I used to find just kind of forums and the forums were so sad.

</details>

所以我想当我开始谈论PCOS时，这就像是在记录一段试图弄清楚它的旅程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And um and so I think when I started to talk about PCOS, it just felt like a documenting of a journey of trying to figure it out.</p>

**Nam Kiwanuka:** 我觉得您把它转化成这样真是太棒了，因为我对子宫肌瘤也有同样的感觉。

<p class="english-text">>> I I think it's so great that um you've turned it into because I I kind of feel the same way too about uh fibroids.</p>
</details>

因为是的，我想在我经历所有这些之前，我真的与自己的身体脱节了。我甚至在怀孕的时候都没有感觉到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because yeah I think before I had all this stuff I was really disconnected from my body I just didn't even when I was pregnant I think the first time that I felt one of my kids kick I was like what is happening I am the alien.</p>

但我想和您谈谈您所说的作为一个面向公众的人，您的外表是工作的一部分，考虑到您还年轻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but I wanted to talk to you a little bit um what you said about being a forward- facing person um how you look uh is a part of the gig and considering like your age being uh younger.</p>
</details>

我想谈谈这一点，因为我确信有些日子您会感到沮丧，也许您的身体没有达到您想要的效果，或者有人对您的外表说了些什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I wanted to just talk a little bit about that because I'm sure there were days when there were frustrations that maybe your body wasn't doing what you wanted it to do or maybe somebody said something about how you looked at you have long hours, maybe you can't um eat certain foods that you would normally eat to manage your PCOS.</p>
</details>

您工作时间很长，也许您不能吃某些通常用来管理PCOS的食物。那么，您认为学习如何管理PCOS最具有挑战性的部分是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, so what what would you say has been the most challenging part of learning how to manage PCOS?</p>
</details>

就像您说的，它像指纹一样。医生似乎真的不知道是什么原因造成的，也不知道如何管理它，而您却在一个如此痴迷于女性外表的行业中努力建立成功的职业生涯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As you said, it's a thumbrint. Doctors don't really seem to know what causes it, how to manage it, while you're trying to build a successful career in an industry that's so obsessed with uh women looking uh a certain type a certain way.</p>
</details>

**Andrea Lewis:** 哦，天哪，我仍在应对这个问题。你知道，几年前我拍了一部电影，我们有一部分拍摄是通宵进行的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Oh my gosh, I'm still navigating that. You know, I shot I did a film a few years ago and um we had a chunk of the shoot that was overnight and for anybody that doesn't know, it it was basically like 7 to 7.</p>
</details>

对于不了解的人来说，基本上是从晚上7点到早上7点。所以我们晚上7点开始，早上7点结束。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it's like we'd start at 7:00 p.m. and we'd basically be ending by 7:00 a.m.</p>
</details>

这真的很难。通宵工作本身就很难。这非常艰难。我们处于一个相当受控的环境中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And um and it was really hard. It was it overnight is hard period. This was very hard. We were in a fairly controlled environment.</p>
</details>

我记得当时非常担心，因为我一直想着，这种压力，无论我吃什么，如何锻炼，或者我尽力睡多久，都会对我的身体造成影响，我可能会因为这种压力而经历一次**发作**（flare up）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and I remember feeling really worried because I just kept thinking, well, the stress of this, no matter what I eat or how I work out or how much sleep I try my best to get, is going to take a toll on my body and I may experience a flare up just because of the stress of it.</p>
</details>

所以，我不得不真正专注于……那段时间我做了很多冥想。那段时间我散了散步。我做了很多“低强度慢速”的运动，我称之为“低强度慢速”，因为我知道这可能会改变我的身体表现，无论我吃什么，睡觉，所有这些事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I had to kind of really focus on uh I did a lot of meditation during that time. I did a little walks during that time. I did a lot of like low low and slow is what I called it because I was aware that that may shift how my body shows up regardless of what I'm eating, uh, sleeping, all of those kinds of things.</p>
</details>

我还经历过一次，不久前，我当时正在拍摄，但我也做了很多旅行。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've also had um an experience that I had not this long ago that that I was filming, but I was doing a lot of travel.</p>
</details>

所以，这次拍摄伴随着很多旅行，睡眠也不太好，而且我没有带我常说的“必备补充剂”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, with this filming, was doing a lot of travel, wasn't really sleeping as well, and I didn't bring kind of like what I say my go-to supplements.</p>
</details>

所以，我总是带着**镁**（magnesium）。我总是带着**维生素D**（vitamin D）。我总是带着**锌**（zinc）。而我当时没有带任何这些东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it's like I always have magnesium with me. I always have vitamin D with me. Um, I always have zinc with me. And I wasn't I didn't have any of those things with me.</p>
</details>

是的，到拍摄结束时，我看到了不同。我看起来不一样了。我感觉不一样了。所有这些事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And yes, by the end of that shoot, I saw the difference. I looked different. I felt different. All of those kinds of things.</p>
</details>

所以，这是那种你必须意识到，我想这就是为什么我的旅程必须有空间让我只是一个普通人，而不是总是一个艺人，而不是总是一个像广告牌一样闪耀的人，而是也要认识到我是一个人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so it it is one of those things that you are um you are aware and and I think that's why it's like my journey has ha has had to have space for me to just be the human to not always be the entertainer to not always be the person who's like shiny like a billboard but to also recognize that I am a human.</p>
</details>

所以这并不总是看起来完美，我可以尽力做到最好，但这只是我所处的空间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so that that doesn't always look perfect and there's I can do my best but that's just the space that I am in.</p>
</details>

所以我有过这样的时刻，我可以回顾一些事情，然后说：“哦，这里发生了发作。”或者，“是的，那时无论我怎么努力，我的身体就是没有反应。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I have had times when I can look on something and be like, "Oh, a flare up was happening here." Or, "Yeah, this is when no matter what I was trying, my body was just not reacting to it.</p>
</details>

“这是我不应该吃这种东西的时候。这是哦，我当时正在试验我吃的东西。”所有这些我都看得到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">Uh, this is when I shouldn't have been eating this thing. This is when oh, I was I was actually experimenting with what I was eating." I can see all of those things.</p>
</details>

所以这很有挑战性，因为是的，你身处一个即使没有这些疾病也会自然而然地挑剔自己的行业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so, it is challenging because yes, you are in an industry that would naturally pick yourself apart even if you didn't have these kind of disorders.</p>
</details>

但我被迫给自己一些关爱。所以，我曾经做了很多关于**自爱**（self-love）的内容，当时是因为我正处于发现PCOS的早期阶段，我试图弄清楚我的PCOS旅程是什么样的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I've been forced to give myself some care. So, I I used to do a lot of content on self-love and at that time was because I was in the the early stages of discovering my PCOS and I was trying to navigate what my PCOS journey looked like.</p>
</details>

每次我研究，每次我感到非常沮丧，它都迫使我回到自爱，因为，是的，它太复杂了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it just the every time I would research, every time I would feel really frustrated, it forced me to have to get back to self-love because um it's so yeah, it's so complex.</p>
</details>

而且看到你的身体有多少是如此失控，因为我很幸运。我没有皮肤问题，但PCOS会带来很多皮肤问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and to see how much of your physical can be so out of control because I'm fortunate. I I don't suffer from the skin issues, but there's a lot of skin issues that come with PCOS.</p>
</details>

有很多，你知道，失控的毛发。有些女性会经历下巴毛发或脱发，而头发是美丽的焦点，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's a lot of um you know, hair that you have out of control. There's women who are experiencing chin hair or loss of hair and hair is such a focus for beauty, right?</p>
</details>

**Nam Kiwanuka:** 对很多人来说，确实如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> It's literally like for so many it's it it really is.</p>
</details>

**Andrea Lewis:** 确实如此。所以要经历这些挑战，但仍然每天都必须出现，这真的很难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so to experience those types of challenges but still kind of have to show up every single day is is really hard.</p>
</details>

所以，我认识的那些仍在应对这些问题，仍在寻找方法来展现自己，感受美丽，对自己感到非常兴奋的女性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so the women that I know that are still navigating even those spaces um and still figuring out ways to show up, to feel beautiful, to feel very excited about themselves.</p>
</details>

是的。我无法向任何人解释，同时还要面对镜头做这些事情的微妙之处。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Um I can't I can't I can't even explain to someone uh the nuance of what it's like to also have to be on camera and do those things.</p>

**Nam Kiwanuka:** 哦，是的。当我患子宫肌瘤时，我的头发掉了。是的。而且有些地方秃了，那真是太可怕了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Oh yeah. When I had um my in the midst of my fibroids, my hair fell out and Yeah. And uh it went bald in certain places and it was horrendous.</p>

我们还有大约五分钟。我的意思是，我可以和您聊五个小时。但我想再问您两个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We have about five minutes left. I mean, I could talk to you for like five hours on this. Um, but I wanted to ask you two more questions.</p>
</details>

您说过PCOS被负面地描述。重点是您将无法生育，或者怀孕会遇到麻烦。您为什么认为扭转这种说法，谈论积极的一面很重要？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, you've said that PCOS is framed in a negative way. The focus is that you're not going to have children or you'll have trouble getting pregnant. Why do you think it's important to flip that and to talk about the positives?</p>
</details>

**Andrea Lewis:** 因为我认为这个世界已经够艰难了。所以，如果你还要考虑自己身体的所有负面因素，我简直无法想象它会如何运作，因为所有这些事情都是相互关联的，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Because I think this world is already so hard. So, you're like, if if I was to also think about all the negatives for my body, I can't even imagine how it would function because you're all of these things meet, right?</p>
</details>

我在这里的思考方式，就是我在这里的感受方式，就是我的身体表现出来的方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">like the way I think in here is the way I feel in here is the way my body also shows up.</p>
</details>

一位生育医生曾对我说过：“你知道，患有PCOS的女性实际上有很多卵子。”她说：“你有很多卵子。你只是需要找到它们。仅此而已。你只是需要得到它们。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um I had a fertility doctor say this to me. She was like, you know, no women with PCOS actually have tons of eggs. She was like, you have tons of eggs. You just have to find them. That's all. You just have to get to them.</p>
</details>

她说，我当时想：“哦，好吧。”你知道，我当时想：“我能接受这一点。”就像，它就在那里。所有东西都在那里。我只是需要把它拼凑起来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And she was like, and I was like, oh, okay. You know, and I was like, I I can rock with that. Like that you have it's there. All the stuff is there. I just have to I just got to piece it together.</p>
</details>

这就是我如何看待PCOS，它就是如此独特。就像我说的，它就像指纹一样。它就像一个谜题。它对你来说是一个独特的谜题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and that's how I see PCOS that is as unique as it is. As I've said, like that it's like a thumb print. It is like this puzzle. It's this unique puzzle for you.</p>
</details>

所以每当我看到患有PCOS的人的故事，但他们正在生第一个孩子，或者第三个孩子，或者他们的身体现在运作得很好，或者他们正在管理它，或者他们感觉很好，或者他们控制了皮肤问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so whenever I see stories of uh people who do have PCOS, but they are having their first child or they're having their third child or they are functioning like their body is really working with them right now or they're managing it or they feel really good or they've controlled their skin.</p>
</details>

这从来不仅仅是因为他们做到了。也是因为他们对自己感觉更好了，他们开始整体上更好地对待自己。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um it's it's never just that they did that. It's also that they felt better about themselves that they started to treat themselves overall better.</p>
</details>

所以我想就像您说的，子宫肌瘤、子宫内膜异位症，这些都是挑战，我们以一种其他人无法理解的方式了解自己的身体。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think like you said fibroids, endometriosis, these things are challenging and we get to learn about our body in a way that nobody else does.</p>
</details>

甚至去看医生，一个你本应信任的专业人士，有时他们甚至不像你那样关心你的身体。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Even so much so as going to a doctor, somebody that you should trust, a professional, and sometimes them not even caring about your body as much as you do.</p>
</details>

所以我想你意识到你真正的生存之道在于积极性，在于真正将这件事视为你可以体验快乐的所有方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I think you are you you realize that your true survival is in positivity in really seeing this thing as all the ways that you can um that you can experience joy.</p>
</details>

所有你可以改变人们谈论它的方式，改变它被对待的方式，然后说：“好吧，这不是这样。对我来说，这是这样。根据我的经验，我需要它看起来像这样。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All the ways that you can actually flip the way it's talked about, flip the way that it's treated and say, "Okay, this is not this is not this thing. This is this for me. For my experience, I need it to look like this."</p>
</details>

所以PCOS，为了管理它，我必须只认为这对我来说只是一个独特的身体。我生活中的一切都是独特的，我的身体也是如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so PCOS, in order for me to manage it, I have to only think that this is just a unique body for me. Everything about my life is unique and so is my body.</p>
</details>

而且，你知道，我每天都必须慢走，这不是一件坏事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the the fact that, you know, I have to go on a slow walk every single day is not a bad thing.</p>

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> That's actually a good thing.</p>

<p class="english-text">And and that I have to pay attention to what I put in my body. that, you know, I I I have to think about my diet a little bit differently than everybody else, but still get to enjoy myself. That's not a bad thing. It's sometimes frustrating, but it's not a bad thing.</p>

**Nam Kiwanuka:** 您没有问题。嗯，我也应该提一下，因为您提过几次为什么不能跑步或者不应该跑步。那是因为它给您的身体带来压力，对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> You're not broken. Um, I should I should also mention because you've said it a few times about why you can't run or you shouldn't run. It's because the stress that your body causes, right?</p>
</details>

**Andrea Lewis:** 是的，从技术上讲。所以，实际上，高强度训练并不是你的朋友。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, technically. So, really, it's like high intensity. High intensity workouts are not your friend.</p>
</details>

所以很多时候，我有一个朋友正在经历这个，她告诉我：“哦，我做了所有这些高强度训练，但我没有减掉任何体重。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">So often times, um, I have a friend kind of going through this who told me like, "Oh, I'm doing all this high intensity and I'm not losing any weight."</p>

我不得不告诉她：“你，那是一个PCOS问题。你可能没有PCOS，但那是PCOS女性会遇到的问题。压力太大了。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I had to say to her, "You that that is a a PCOS problem. You might not have PCOS, but that is something that PCOS women deal with. The stress is too much.</p>

如果你放慢一切，你可能会看到更多的结果。如果你专注于举重，但只是慢速。如果你专注于长时间散步。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think living with PCOS is is challenging because you have to do a checklist every single uh day.</p>

我想我在美国，特别是洛杉矶，我居住的地方，看到的区别可能是**GLP1s**（Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists: 胰高血糖素样肽-1受体激动剂）的使用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'd say the difference that I've seen in you in the US uh obviously specifically Los Angeles where I live is probably the use of GLP1s um ompic anything like that is is a lot more emphasized in the US in terms of management of these kinds of disorders because of the weight problems that people often have.</p>
</details>

**Ozempic**（Semaglutide: 司美格鲁肽）之类的药物在美国在管理这类疾病方面得到了更多的强调，因为人们经常有体重问题。

所以我当时想：“哦，这根本不适合我。”我的身体完全没有好好反应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I was like, "Oh, this is not for me at all." like my body did not react to it well in any way.</p>

<p class="english-text">And and I always think I was like if I had gotten it in the US would I have had that experience? I have no idea.</p>

<p class="english-text">But again and it was something that I had to bring up to my doctor h as something to help me to manage my PCOS and um and they were kind of like ah I guess so.</p>

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">versus in the US I think it is actually a lot more um talked about and and more freely prescribed. Um, so I'd say that that's the difference.</p>
