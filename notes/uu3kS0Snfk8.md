### 犯罪言论与数据对比

**主持人**: 在今年的保守党大会上，皮埃尔·波利耶夫（Pier Poilievre）又一次提出了一个非常熟悉的主题：犯罪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: During his speech at this year's Conservative convention, Pier Poilievre hit on a very familiar theme, crime.

</details>

**主持人**: “在自由党执政10年后，加拿大比以往任何时候都更加昂贵、犯罪更多、更危险、更依赖、更分裂。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: "After 10 years of liberal rule, Canada is more costly and crimeridden, dangerous and dependent and divided than ever before.

</details>

**主持人**: 自由党方面，他们正在提议更严格的犯罪政策，比如收紧保释条件，并允许判决连续执行。所以是的，两党都在强调“严打犯罪”的信息。这并非空穴来风。**加拿大独立民调机构安格斯里德研究所（Angus Reid Institute）**最近的一项民意调查显示，五分之三的加拿大人认为，过去五年里他们居住地的犯罪率有所上升。但数字实际说了什么？我们来看看**加拿大统计局（Stats Can）**的一些数据。你可以看到，自2014年左右以来，警方报告的犯罪率一直在上升，但从总体趋势来看，我们现在所处的情况似乎比1998年要好。我们是不是遗漏了什么？还是公众的看法与现实脱节了？如果脱节了，又是为什么？我们将深入探讨犯罪数据，以及加拿大人对犯罪的看法，并审视恐惧与事实之间的关系。欢迎收看《The Rundown》。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: The Liberals, for their part, are proposing stricter policies around crime. things like making bail harder to get and allowing for consecutive sentences. So yeah, both parties are leaning into a tough on crime message. And that's not coming out of nowhere. Recent polling from the Angus Reed Institute shows three in five Canadians believe crime has gone up where they live over the past 5 years. But what do the numbers actually say? Have a look at some data from Stats Can. You can see that police reported crime has been rising since around 2014, but the way that the top line comes down sure makes it look like we're in a better place now than we were in 1998. Is there something we're missing here? Or are perceptions out of step with reality? And if they are, why? We're going to dig into the data on crime and into what Canadians believe about crime and look at the relationship between fears and facts. This is the rundown.

</details>

### 公众恐惧与实际数据

**主持人**: 大多数加拿大人认为，过去五年里他们社区的犯罪率有所上升。这是根据安格斯里德研究所最近的一项民意调查得出的。但这些担忧与实际情况相符吗？我采访了安格斯里德研究所所长沙奇·科尔（Shachi Curl）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: The majority of Canadians believe that crime in their community has increased over the past 5 years. That's according to recent polling from the Angus Reed Institute. But do those fears line up with what's actually happening? I asked Shachi Curl, president of the Angus Reed Institute.

</details>

**沙奇·科尔**: 贵研究所发现，62%的加拿大人，也就是大约五分之三人，认为过去五年里他们社区的犯罪率一直在上升。那么，请帮助我们理解为什么加拿大人会有这种感觉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shachi Curl**: Your institute found that 62% of Canadians, that's about three in five people, believe that over the past 5 years, crime has been rising in their community. So, help us understand why Canadians are feeling this way.

</details>

**沙奇·科尔**: 我认为首先要做的是看看“是什么”，然后再聊聊“为什么”。那些认为“我感觉我社区的犯罪率在上升”的加拿大人，占了近三分之二，这大约是十几年前认为如此的人数的两倍。所以，这是一个我们长期以来一直在询问和追踪的问题。但令人震惊的是，早在2014年，也就是大约12年前，认为如此的人数只有30%。现在是62%。所以，有几件事正在发生，对吧？这是一个关于感知的问题，简。你是否觉得在你的社区里不安全？有三分之二的人回答“是的，我感觉不安全”。现在，我们需要像你提到的那样，深入探讨一下“为什么”。嗯，其中一些原因与许多社区对街头混乱程度的真实感知有关，无论是无家可归者群体、阿片类药物危机，还是精神健康问题，或者这些问题的组合。我感觉加拿大人在告诉我们，他们看到更多身边的人在街上过得不好，这让他们感到不安全。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shachi Curl**: I think the the the really the the first thing to do is look at the what and then let's chat about the why. that nearly 2thirds of Canadians who say I I feel like crime is rising in my community uh represents a double the number who felt that way a dozen years ago. So this is a question we've been asking and tracking for a really long time. But what is quite stark is back in 2014, so just about 12 years ago, the number of people who felt that way was only 30%. It's now 62%. So you you have a a there's a couple of things going on, right? But this is a perceptive question, Jan. So, do you feel less safe in your community? And you've got twothirds saying, "Yes, I do feel less safe." Now, we've got to unpack some of the why, like you mentioned. Well, some of this does have to do in a lot of communities with um real perceptions of call it more disorder on the street, whether it's unhoused communities, whether it's the opioid crisis, whether it's a mental health uh whether it's a combination of that plus the mental health crisis. I I get the sense that Canadians are telling us that they're seeing uh more visible uh results of of people um just not doing so well in front of them on the streets in their communities and that speaks to a sense of a lack of safety.

</details>

**沙奇·科尔**: 但有趣的是，当我们审视全国各地的社区暴力犯罪时，你会发现财产犯罪有所增加，但像**刺伤、谋杀**这类暴力犯罪的数字实际上一直在下降。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shachi Curl**: The the interesting part of this though is when we look at violent crime uh in communities uh across the country some of that is is uh you see more in terms of property crime but in terms of violent crime stabbings murder that kind of thing uh those numbers are actually have been over time declining.

</details>

**主持人**: 我认为，看看多伦多，**凶杀率**比前一年几乎减半。那么，在这方面，请帮助我们稍微了解一下人口统计。现在，哪些人口统计群体对犯罪更恐惧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I think if we see here in Toronto the homicide rates have nearly half from the year before. So uh so on that note um help us understand uh demographics a little bit. Uh what what demographics uh groups are more afraid of crime right now?

</details>

**沙奇·科尔**: 我认为，在那些将犯罪和不安全感视为自身感知或首要问题的人群中，最大的驱动因素之一是政治因素。所以，你知道，两件事可以同时发生。第一，我们看到**政治光谱**上越来越多的人，无论他们如何投票，都表示感觉不安全。第二，当你询问加拿大人“对你来说，最重要的问题是什么？”时，也能看到这一点。十到十二年前，认为犯罪和公共安全问题是首要问题的人大约占4%-5%。今天，这个数字是20%。而且你知道吗？自由党选民对此的认同度更高，新民主党选民认同度也更高，魁北克省的魁北克人选民认同度也更高。但主要的驱动因素是，联邦保守党选民最有可能推动这一议题，部分原因可能是他们感受更深，也因为他们的领导人皮埃尔·波利耶夫对此谈论得更多。简，我还要说的是，从意识形态上看，关于犯罪和公共安全问题，可能与经济问题、社会问题或身份政治问题不同，犯罪和公共安全问题往往**意识形态敏感度较低**。所以，你可能在很多问题上倾向于左派，但当你晚上独自出门走在街上或社区时，仍然可能感觉不安全。这是我们长期追踪的另一个衡量标准，我们也注意到越来越多的人表示在天黑后在社区里感觉不安全。这是一个巨大的变化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shachi Curl**: I I think that one of the biggest drivers in terms of who's identifying uh crime uh and and lack of safety in their communities either as something as they're perceiving or as a top issue for them. There is such a political driving line along this. So you know two things can be true at the same time. Number one, we're seeing more people across the political spectrum, regardless of how they vote, saying they feel less safe. And and you also see this borne out in the data when we ask Canadians um you know, what is the top issue for you? Again, 10 12 years ago, the number of people saying crime and public safety issues maybe 4%, 5%. Today, that number is at 20%. And you know what? Liberal voters are identifying it more. NDP voters are identifying it more in Quebec, more block voters, but the big driver here is the fact that conservative voters federally are most likely to to be driving this in part because uh maybe it's something that they are feeling more but also because their leader Pier Poilievre is talking about it a lot more and Jan I would also say that ideologically what's really interesting about crime and public safety issues maybe unlike economic issues issues or social issues or identity politics issues. Crime and public safety tends to be a little bit less ideologically sensitive. So, you can be someone who leans left on a lot of issues, but still maybe doesn't feel that safe when you leave your house at night walking alone in your neighborhood or your community, which is another measure or metric we've been tracking over time and are also noticing more people saying they don't really feel that safe in their neighborhood after dark. That's a big change.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，我想谈谈这本身的结果，也谈谈这个问题。这是我记得高中时，我的一位老师跟我们讲过的一个问题，你知道，当你晚上独自回家时，该准备些什么？就是这种我们必须时刻警惕的想法。我只是好奇，不仅是结果本身，还有为什么问这个问题？为什么当我们谈论犯罪和安全感时，要问这个问题？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Well, I want to talk about that just in in the results in itself, but also the question. This is a question that I remember in high school, uh, one of my teachers talking us to us about, you know, when you were walking home by yourself at night, what to prepare for? It's kind of this this idea that we have to be on edge. I'm just curious, not just the results on itself, but why that question? Why is that a question that we that we're asking when we talk about sort of crime and and feeling safe?

</details>

**沙奇·科尔**: 嗯，这是一种重要的衡量方式。现在，你，你，我想如果你正确理解我的意思，你是在质疑为什么要把这个想法种在人们脑子里，或者为什么问这个问题让他们那样想。问题是，你知道，我们问各种各样的问题，关于各种各样的事情。也许他们在想，也许他们没想。而且这也不是我们在调查中问的第一个问题，所以我们不是在引导他们直接去想那个。有很多问题你都会问，关于，你知道，嗯，你知道，你感觉住在你的社区里怎么样。你知道，你自己的整体安全感如何。你是那种更谨慎的人，还是那种更冒险的人？你问了人口统计方面的问题。这也是一个关键问题，可以追溯到几十年前，尤其是在试图了解老年人，有时在这个问题上还存在性别差异——独自夜间行走，男性与女性。所以这是一个非常成熟的问题，在许多司法管辖区，在美国、加拿大、欧洲，已经问了几十年了，它是几个被用来衡量人们个人安全经历、财产安全或保障以及财务安全和保障的问题之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shachi Curl**: Um, again, it's an important way to measure. Now, you you're I I think if I'm interpreting what you're saying correctly there, you you're you're sort of challenging the notion of why put that seed in people's heads or why ask that question so they're thinking about it that way. The thing is, you know, we ask all kinds of questions about all kinds of things. Maybe they're thinking about it, maybe they're not. And it's not the first question we ask in a survey so that, you know, we're prompting them to go right there. There are lots of questions you ask about, you know, um, you know, how how you feel living in your neighborhood. You know, what your own uh, sense of overall, you know, security is. Are you someone who takes more precautions or are you somebody who takes more risks? You asked about demography. It's also a key uh, question that goes back, you know, 50, 60, 70 years. uh particularly in terms of trying to understand how maybe people who are older there's also sometimes a g a gender divide on this issue men walking uh alone at night versus women walking alone at night so this is a very tried and true question that's been asked you know in in many jurisdictions in the US in Canada in Europe for many decades and it is one part of um uh several questions that are asked to to sort of gauge uh people's experiences with their own personal safety with property uh safety or security and also uh financial safety and security.

</details>

### 盗窃与网络犯罪

**主持人**: 你们报告中的另一个焦点是**盗窃**和**零售业员工**。嗯，在过去一年里，加拿大人看到了大量的视频，这些视频可能是个例，但请帮助我们理解，报告发现了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: One of the other focuses uh from your data was looking at shoplifting and and retail workers. Um this is over the last you know over the past year Canadians have seen plenty of videos um and these might be isolated but help us understand you know what did the report find?

</details>

**沙奇·科尔**: 我们对零售业从业人员进行了一项特别的问卷调查。你是否注意到更多的盗窃或盗窃未遂？这是你不得不处理的事情吗？绝对比过去更多了。这无疑与我们听到的生活成本上升、食品价格上涨、各种商品价格上涨有关。当你走进药店时，你会看到现在的措施，你知道，剃须刀片，不是刀片本身，而是剃须刀被锁在塑料柜后面。很多你以前可以直接从货架上拿走的东西，现在都锁在玻璃后面了。这在一定程度上是因为在零售业工作的人们注意到了更多的损失或损失企图，而且公司，这些零售连锁店告诉零售员工，“看，你的安全不值得冒被盗的风险。”所以，你知道，有其他方法和其他措施来处理这个问题，但这是零售业员工自己指出的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shachi Curl**: Well, we did a a special uh question to people working in retail. Are you noticing more shoplifting or attempts at shoplifting? Is this something that that you're having to interact with? It absolutely is more than than in the past. And certainly that tracks with what we hear about a rising cost of living, higher food prices, uh price inflation on all sorts of things. and the kinds of measures that you see when you walk into the drugstore now, you know, that the the the the razor blade, but not the razor blades, but you know, the the shaving razors are behind plastic or or or plexiglass. All kinds of things that you used to just be able to take off of a shelf are behind plexiglass now. Uh and and that is in part because uh people who work in retail are noticing more loss or attempt at loss and uh and companies uh these these uh retail chains are are saying to to retail workers look uh your safety is not worth the risk of uh of theft. So, you know, other there are other ways and other measures to deal with this, but it's something that uh retail workers themselves are identifying.

</details>

**沙奇·科尔**: 而且，简，还有另一个盗窃领域，似乎影响着越来越多的加拿大人，那就是**网络犯罪**领域的盗窃企图或实际盗窃，或成功的盗窃，或欺诈企图。你知道，我们现在谁没有遇到过有人试图发送钓鱼链接，或者试图通过这种方式骗取你的钱财，无论是通过像PayPal这样的第三方平台欺诈（我不是只针对PayPal，而是所有相关的欺诈），还是直接因为Visa卡上的可疑交易，或者银行账单上显示“嘿，我没付过这个”，然后不得不打电话给银行或信用卡公司去处理。我们有五分之四的加拿大人，80%，表示这是他们正在注意到的事情。将这一点与你社区的犯罪感知联系起来，你知道，四五十年前，甚至三十年前，与之相当的是有人试图抢劫你，你知道，街上有人拦住你，向你要钱包。现在的窃贼不是试图面对面地这样做。他们试图通过让你在不经意间点击某个东西来做到这一点，从而获取你的信息并试图欺诈你，而这现在似乎是现代的抢劫方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shachi Curl**: And you know, Jan, there's there's another area of theft that really seems to be affecting so many more Canadians, and that's attempts or actual theft or successful theft uh in in the cyber crime area or in attempted fraud. And you know, who among us now has not noticed uh either an attempt at somebody trying to send a fishy link or or try and get your money that way, whether it's via a third-party platform like PayPal fraud, and I'm not just calling out PayPal, all kinds of frauds related to that, or directly as a result of fishy charges on on your Visa card or or uh through your bank statement going, "Hey, I didn't pay for that." having to get on the phone to the bank or to your credit card company and and unpack that. We're not four in five Canadians, 80% say that this is something that they are noticing. And and to tie it back into perceptions of crime in your neighborhood, you know, 40, 50 years ago, the equivalent to that, even 30 years ago, was someone trying to mug you, you know, confronting you on the street and demanding your wallet. Uh the thieves now are not trying to do this to you face to face. They try to do it uh by getting you to to click mindlessly on something when you're not paying attention to get access to your information and try to defraud you and and that now seems to be modern-day mugging.

</details>

### 加拿大人比美国人更恐惧犯罪？

**主持人**: 在我们最后30秒，我必须问一下，当我们谈论感知时，加拿大人经常将自己与美国进行比较。所以，我很想知道，如果我们看数据，它是否告诉我们，我们是否比南边的邻居更害怕犯罪？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: In our last 30 seconds, I do have to ask when we talk about perception, Canadians often compare themselves to the US. So, I I am curious um if we're looking at the data, does it tell us uh whether we're more fearful of crime than our neighbors to the south?

</details>

**沙奇·科尔**: 这是一个非常有趣的问题，简，它确实让我摇头。事实上，我们问了美国人他们在这个问题上的看法。加拿大人实际上对社区不安全感和犯罪增加的看法更为强烈，而美国人则不太可能说他们认为过去几年他们社区的犯罪正在增加。我不知道这是否是因为美国人对社区的犯罪和暴力习以为常，或者是因为当你的基准可能是街头枪支暴力时，如果你经历的枪支暴力比美国某些社区的人少，我们就会看向边境以南发生的事情，而作为加拿大人，我们会对此有不同的看法。但美国人自己更倾向于说，“是的，我的社区犯罪没有增加，与加拿大人相比。”这对我来说有点令人惊讶。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shachi Curl**: It's such an interesting question, Jan, and it's one that really did make me shake my head. In fact, we asked Americans where where they are on this issue. Canadians are actually more heightened to perceptions of of lack of safety and increasing crime in their communities relative to the US where we actually see uh Americans less likely to say that yes they think that crime is increasing over the last few years in their communities and I don't know whether that's uh Americans becoming inured to to crime and violence in their communities or whether when your baseline is maybe gun violence on the streets if you're if you're experiencing less of it as as maybe people are in the United States in certain communities. We look to what's happening south of the border and and as Canadians, we would have a different perception of that, but Americans themselves more likely to say, "Yeah, crime is not increasing in my communities compared to Canadians." That that was a bit surprising to me.

</details>

**主持人**: 很遗憾，我们只能到此为止了。沙奇，非常感谢你。非常感谢你的时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And unfortunately, that's where we're going to have to leave it. Shashi, thank you so much. Really appreciate your time on this.

</details>

**沙奇·科尔**: 这是我的荣幸。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Shachi Curl**: My pleasure. to take your jam.

</details>

### 风险感知与恐惧心理

**主持人**: 你可能会认为，当犯罪率下降时，恐惧水平也会随之下降，但情况似乎并非总是如此。那么，让我们来看看风险感知，以及何时感到害怕是有道理的，何时可能没有。我请教了多伦多大学士嘉堡分校的心理学教授史蒂夫·乔丹斯（Steve Jordans）和威尔弗里德·劳里埃大学的警务与公共安全助理教授、前警官詹妮弗·马格努斯（Jennifer Magnus）。史蒂夫，我先问你。我们刚才听了民调专家科尔关于加拿大人对犯罪日益增长的恐惧。我想从心理学家的角度问问，加拿大人对犯罪感到恐惧是否合理？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: You might expect that when crime rates fall, fear levels follow, but that doesn't always seem to be the case. So, let's take a look at risk perception and when being afraid makes sense and when it might not. I was joined by Steve Jordans, a psychology professor at the University of Toronto Scar Bro, and Jennifer Magnus, a former police officer and an assistant professor of policing and public safety at Wilfrid Laurier University. Steve, I'm going to start with you. We just heard from pollster curl on Canadians fear, growing fear of crime, and I'm wondering from a psychologist's point of view whether it makes sense for Canadians to be afraid of crime.

</details>

**史蒂夫·乔丹斯**: 是的，我认为我们看到的也是一种非常普遍的威胁内化，我们现在从四面八方都感受到威胁，对吧？我们有环境问题，有地缘政治问题。我们的大脑会本能地对威胁做出反应。事实上，它有专门的系统来寻找威胁并让我们做好准备。而这些系统现在就像前所未有一样被激活。我们处于一种慢性压力状态。当这种情况发生时，你知道，像犯罪这样的事情，虽然一直被认为是威胁，但现在可能被认为比通常情况更具威胁性，更有可能发生。所以，我认为环境因素确实在加剧我们现在的这种感知。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Jordans**: Yeah, I think what we're seeing also is is a very much an internalization of all the threat we're all feeling from all sides now, right? We've got the environmental stuff, we got geopolitical stuff. Our our brain just sort of reacts to threat. In fact, it's it's got special systems just to look for threat and to get us ready for it. And those systems are kind of engaged like never before now. And we have this sort of chronic stress. And when that happens, you know, things like crime, which would always be perceived as as threatening, but probably are perceived as more threatening, more likely to happen than they than they typically would. So, I think the environment is really contributing to this perception we're having.

</details>

**主持人**: 詹妮弗，正如我们在上一段中了解到的，统计数据显示过去一年的犯罪率有所下降。那么，为什么这似乎没有引起人们的共鸣呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Jennifer, as we learned in our last segment, the stats show crime has come down a bit in the last year. So, why doesn't that seem to resonate with people?

</details>

**詹妮弗·马格努斯**: 我认为是因为它无时无刻不在我们眼前，尤其是在社交媒体上。过去，我们只有在新闻发生时才能看到新闻，通常是在晚间新闻。而现在，我们随时随地都能在指尖看到它。所以人们觉得它一直都在那里，他们看到它发生，他们几乎能与那些同样经历过的人产生共鸣，这就会导致他们生活中恐惧感的增加。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Magnus**: I think because it's in our faces all the time in social media. Back in the day, we only saw news when it happened on the hour, usually in the evening news. And now we see it at our fingertips whenever we want. So people feel like it's always there and they see it happening and they almost resonate with the individuals who are also experiencing it which then causes that increased feel of fear in their lives.

</details>

**史蒂夫·乔丹斯**: 是的。而且，如果我没记错的话，社交媒体的设计就是为了吸引眼球，而我们会被可怕的事物所吸引。所以，不仅仅是我们都在从社交媒体获取新闻，社交媒体本身就有偏向于向我们呈现这些可怕内容的倾向。詹妮弗，我想问问，你知道，就我们看到的犯罪类型而言，我希望你能回到你一线工作的经历，但我们看到的犯罪类型，在社交媒体上看到的，在晚上6点新闻里看到的，感觉更个人化了，你知道，当看到**入室盗窃**、**汽车抢劫**时，这些都离我们更近了。这些情况是否也引起了共鸣？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Jordans**: Yeah. And if I if I may just add to that quickly too, the the design of social media is to grab eyeballs and and we are attracted to things that are scary. And so it's not just that we're all getting our news from social media. There's a bias in social media to present this scary stuff to us. Jennifer, I do want to ask, you know, the in terms of the types of crimes that we're seeing, and I'm hoping you can maybe uh go back to, you know, your time on the front lines as well, but the types of crimes that we're seeing and that we're seeing on social media that we're seeing, you know, on our 6:00 news, feels like it's more personal, uh that, you know, these are much closer to home when we see uh home invasions, when we're seeing, uh, you know, carjackings. Does does any of that resonate as well?

</details>

**詹妮弗·马格努斯**: 我会说“是”。而且，尤其是当这些事情发生时，人们对被闯入的恐惧感会更大。比如在**阿尔伯塔省的农村地区**，财产犯罪实际上有所增加。当个人经历财产犯罪时，他们会感到被侵犯，然后在自己本应感到安全的家中感到恐惧。我知道，作为一名警官，我们遇到了很多毒品犯罪、精神健康问题。我和我的同事们正在进行一项关于警官经历日益增多的毒品犯罪和无家可归问题的研究。他们发现，警官们正以更高的频率经历这些问题，而且人们变得越来越暴力。而且很多情况实际上是与**陌生人犯罪**有关。即使它不像熟人犯罪那样普遍，但它仍然会引起人们的恐惧感。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Magnus**: I would say yes. And the fear of being broken into is greater for people especially when it's happening. What like in rural Alberta it is actually on the increased property crime and when an individual experiences property crime they feel violated and then they feel fearful in their own h home when they're supposed to feel safe. And I know as a police officer, we encountered a lot of drug crime, mental health, and I'm my colleague and I are actually doing a study on police officers experiences with the increased drug crimes and homelessness. And they're finding that police officers are experiencing that at a greater rate and people are becoming more violent. And it a lot of it is actually happening with stranger crime. even though it's not as prevalent as known crime, it still creates that sense of fear in people.

</details>

### 农村犯罪与恐惧

**主持人**: 詹妮弗，我想继续问你。当你谈到农村地区时，我们想到犯罪时，通常会与大城市联系起来。嗯，但正如你提到的，你正在进行的项目，我想了解一下农村地区的情况。住在农村地区的人们是否和住在埃德蒙顿或卡尔加里的人一样害怕犯罪？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Uh Jennifer, I want to stick with you. Uh when you talk about sort of the rural when we think of crime, it's often associated with big cities. Um but as you mentioned, the project that you're working on and and sort of get I want to get a sense of rural areas. Are people just as fearful of crime living in where you are, say in rural Alberta versus say Edmonton or Calgary?

</details>

**詹妮弗·马格努斯**: 完全是。而且我实际上是这里阿尔伯塔省农村地区警察委员会的主席。财产犯罪有所增加，**加拿大皇家骑警（RCMP）**也注意到了这一点。有趣的是，从2023年开始，他们看到暴力犯罪有所增加。其中很多与**家庭暴力**有关。所以罪犯是受害者认识的人，但很多毒品问题正在从城市地区转移到阿尔伯塔省农村地区，他们正在闯入人们的家中，这导致恐惧感增加。而且，由于加拿大皇家骑警通常需要15到20分钟甚至几小时才能赶到，人们会担心如果他们在闯入者行动时抓到他们，他们可能无法得到营救。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Magnus**: Absolutely. And I actually am the chair of the police committee in rural Alberta here. And there is an increase in property crime and the RCMP have noted that. And interestingly, starting in 2023, they've seen an increase in violent crime. A lot of it is associated with domestic violence. So the offenders are known to the victim, but a lot of the drug issues are moving to rural Alberta, which from the urban areas, and they're breaking into people's homes, which is creating an increased fear. And because the RCMP are often 15, 20 minutes, hours away from helping somebody, there is that fear that they're not going to be able to be saved if they catch an intruder in the action.

</details>

**史蒂夫·乔丹斯**: 是的。而且，你知道，那些个人犯罪，比如**入室盗窃**，是最典型的，因为这不仅仅是……想象一下我们看新闻时，我们看到很多事情，我们觉得它们与我们无关，比如另一辆拖车着火了，那些拖车公司的人在做什么？但这似乎与我们个人无关。但入室盗窃却与我们息息相关。你知道，我们能感觉到这一点，结果就是我们更有可能记住那些故事。当我们估计事件发生的概率时，我们使用一种叫做“可用性启发式”的东西。我们能多快地想起该事件的例子？而这些入室盗窃的例子会很快地浮现在脑海中。所以，它们可能对我们如何判断事件发生的可能性产生了不成比例的影响。我们可能认为它比实际发生的可能性大得多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Jordans**: Yeah. Yeah. And and I really want to follow up on that, you know, those personal crimes like the home invasion is the prototypical because it's not just like imagine when we sit and watch the news. We see a bunch of things that we don't think really, you know, another tow truck is on fire and there and what are these tow truck people doing? But it doesn't really feel personal to us. The home invasions do. You know, we can kind of feel that and and as a result, we're more likely to remember those stories. And when we estimate the probabilities of events, one of the things we use is something called the availability heuristic. How quickly can we bring to mind examples of that event? And these home invasions come to mind pretty quickly. So, they're probably having a disproportionate impact on on how we all, you know, figure out how likely is this. And we probably think it's far more likely than it is.

### 大脑的恐惧反应

**主持人**: 帮助我们理解一下，你知道，当我们看到社交媒体上的这些视频，看到新闻里的这些视频时，我们的大脑会怎么做？我们的本能是什么？我们该怎么办？你知道，我们在加拿大已经有很多关于我们可以作为房主采取哪些法律措施来保护自己的讨论。你知道，当我们谈论恐惧时，有逃跑，有冻结，请帮助我们理解一下，当我们观看社交媒体上的**入室盗窃**视频时，大脑是如何工作的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Help us understand a little bit in terms of the brain, you know, when we see these videos on social media, when we see these videos on the news, what what is our instinct? What are we doing? Is it I think we've had a lot of conversation of you know here in Canada about you know what laws we can do as homeowners to protect oursel there is this you know when we talk about the you know the fear there's the flight there is the freeze help us understand sort of how the brain is working when we when I am watching a video of a smash and grab uh on social media

</details>

**史蒂夫·乔丹斯**: 是的，是的。所以，实际上，进入大脑的每一丝感官信息都会经过这些叫做**杏仁核**的小东西，它位于我们大脑两侧，像杏仁状的部分。杏仁核的工作是感知危险。它的目的是让我们活下来。当它检测到威胁时，并且是以非常宽泛的意义上的威胁，不一定是一个拿着棒球棒的人。它甚至可能是尴尬或社交上的威胁。它会启动这种“战、逃、冻”系统。在社交媒体上，你知道，冻结并没有太大意义。逃跑，我希望更多的人能逃离社交媒体，但他们没有。所以，这给你留下了什么？就是“战”。而在社交媒体上的“战”实际上意味着分享，就是让人们知道，嘿，有危险。所以，这是另一种放大。现在，让你害怕的东西，你更有可能分享，这会使它对其他人来说更加普遍。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Jordans**: yeah yeah so really every sensory bit of information that comes into the brain goes through these little things called the amydala little almond shaped part of our brain on either side and the amy Amigdala's job is to sense danger. It's it's there to keep us alive. And when it detects something threatening and threatened in a very general sense, it doesn't have to be somebody with a baseball bat. It could be even embarrassment or or social, you know, threats. Um, it'll kick in this fight, flee, freeze system. It's social media. You know, freeze doesn't really make a whole lot of sense. U flee. I wish a lot more people were fleeing social media than they are. Um, they're not. Um, so what does that leave you? It leaves you fight. and and fight in social media really means to share um to kind of let people know, hey, there's this danger. And so that's another amplification. Now, something that scares you, you're more likely to share and that's going to make it more prevalent for everybody else.

</details>

**主持人**: 詹妮弗，当我们看到人们在街上吸食**毒品**，或者有人在公共场合出现**精神健康问题**时，这对我们的安全感有什么影响？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Jennifer, when we see people doing, for example, hard drugs on the street or someone having a a mental health episode in public, what does that do uh to our sense of safety?

</details>

**詹妮弗·马格努斯**: 嗯，它会增加恐惧感，因为你常常感到无助。而且，由于加拿大许多城市和地区警力不足，他们觉得安全保障并不总是随时可用。我可以亲身说，我以前在**卡尔加里市中心**工作，那时不像现在这么糟糕。我知道，当我走在卡尔加里市中心时，你会看到无家可归者，你会看到吸毒的人，比如那些神志不清的人，无论是吸食冰毒还是其他什么。这很吓人，因为他们会变得有攻击性。而且很多时候人们不知道如何应对这种情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Magnus**: Well, it creates a greater level of fear because oftentimes you feel helpless. And because a lot of cities and areas across Canada are having less police officers, they feel that that safety element isn't always readily available to them. And I can personally say that I used to work downtown Calgary and it wasn't as bad as it is now. And I know that when I'm walking in downtown Calgary, I mean, you see homeless individuals, you see drug people, like people whacked out on whether it's meth or whatever it is. And it is it's frightening because they become confrontational. And a lot of times people don't know how to react in those situations,

</details>

**史蒂夫·乔丹斯**: 是的。而且，即使他们不变得有攻击性，我们的大脑自然也会害怕我们不了解的事物。这些人可能就是我们不了解的人。但同样，当我们看到街上的一些人，我们不太清楚他们是怎么变成这样的，我们也不太了解他们是否危险。你知道，很多经历无家可归的人根本不危险，对吧？但是因为我们不真正理解，所以它会让我们的大脑感到害怕。大脑喜欢能够预测人们将如何反应以及如何行动。当我们觉得我们没有这种预测能力时，我们不确定他们会做什么，那么他们就会变得可怕。詹妮弗，你，你，是的，请说。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Jordans**: Yeah. And even when they don't become confrontational, the brain naturally is fearful of things we don't understand very well. And those could be peoples we don't understand very well. But again, when we see, you know, some of these individuals on the street and we don't quite get how they got there and we don't really understand if they're dangerous or not, you know, a lot a lot of the people experiencing homelessness, for example, are not dangerous at all, right? Um, but because we don't really understand that it's scary to the brain, the scare the brain likes to be able to predict how people are going to respond and how people are going to act. When we feel like we don't have that prediction, we're not sure what they're going to do, then they become scary. Jennifer, you were you were Yeah, go ahead.

</details>

**詹妮弗·马格努斯**: 是的，我只是想补充一下我们现在正在进行的研究。很多警官实际上说，无家可归者群体担心自己的生命安全，因为他们住在帐篷城里。他们住在那些让他们感到不安全的地方，而且他们无处可去。所以，我同意史蒂夫的说法，这对于那些个体来说绝对是一种威胁。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Magnus**: Yes, I was just going to jump in with the study that we're doing right now. A lot of police officers are actually saying that the homeless population are fearful for their lives because they're they're living in tent cities. They're living in areas where they don't feel safe and they have nowhere else to go. And so that I agree with what Steve's saying is it is absolutely a threatening thing for even those individuals. Yeah.

</details>

### 警力可见性与社区关系

**主持人**: 詹妮弗，我想继续问你。你曾在**卡尔加里警察局**工作了14年。你提到了警官短缺的问题。增加警力可见性是否是解决人们恐惧的一种潜在方法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Uh Jennifer, I want to stick with you. Uh you were a police officer with Calgary Police Services for 14 years. Uh you had mentioned sort of the shortage of police officers. Is having more visible police presence a potential answer to addressing people's fears?

</details>

**詹妮弗·马格努斯**: 绝对是。在卡尔加里，警察局长曾让我们的省警部门与卡尔加里警察局合作。他们所做的就是走访卡尔加里市中心，与人们交谈，处理犯罪问题。这项举措带来的安全感提升是惊人的。我认为这也是为什么卡尔加里警察局会在卡尔加里市中心设立**步行巡逻**的原因，因为在高楼里工作的人们感到不安全。所以，增加地面警力可见性确实能给人们带来安全感。那么，对于那些与警察关系不佳的社区呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Magnus**: Absolutely. And in Calgary here, the chief of police actually had our sheriffs or our provincial police service partner with the Calgary Police. and all they did was walk around downtown Calgary talking to people dealing with the crime element. And the level of safety that resulted in that initiative was amazing. And I think that is actually why the Calgary police put in a foot patrol in downtown Calgary because individuals working in the highrises were feeling less safe. And so having more boots on the ground and visible police can actually give individuals that level of safety. What about people who have uh or communities rather that have a a poor relationship uh with police?

</details>

**詹妮弗·马格努斯**: 在这种情况下，我认为警察与这些人互动和接触很重要。我知道卡尔加里警察局和加拿大皇家骑警都会举办社区论坛，邀请那些可能对警察运作方式有疑问的人，比如那些来自警察关系不好的国家的人，并试图建立这些关系。我认为这些都非常重要。我还会建议人们尝试参加**骑警体验**（ride along），这样他们就能看到警察每天都在处理什么，并认识到这是一项艰巨的工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Magnus**: in that case, I think it's important and incumbent on the police to interact and engage with those individuals. And I know that the Calgary Police and the RCMP as well, they hold community forums which invite individuals that maybe have questions about how the police function if they come from a different country where the relationship with the police is is not a good one and trying to build those relationships. And I think those are very important. And I would also suggest that people try and do ride alongs so they can see what police actually deal with on a day-to-day basis and see that it is a difficult job.

</details>

**主持人**: 史蒂夫，我想象一下，对一些人来说，即使在多伦多，对于那些乘坐公共交通的人来说，看到**穿制服的人**可能会给他们带来安全感。嗯，我只是想知道，你认为增加警力是答案，还是我们需要解决这些问题的根源？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Steve, I imagine for some people uh even here on Toronto, for people who take transit, for example, seeing someone in uniform might help them give them a sense of safety. Um, and I'm just wondering, do you think a greater police presence is the answer or do we need to address perhaps the root cause of some of these issues?

</details>

**史蒂夫·乔丹斯**: 嗯，我认为，当涉及到感知时，这可能很棘手。显然，我们希望解决根源问题。我们希望努力减少犯罪。但当然，有警察在场，尤其是像詹妮弗建议的那样，如果你感到舒适并与这些警察有联系，如果他们有那种社区警务的氛围，这对我们来说是这样的：如果我们坐在地铁上，有一些我们不太确定的人物，我们又有点害怕，因为我们不知道他们会怎么做。你知道，如果附近有警察，我们知道这听起来有点糟糕，但这就是社会运作的方式。那是他们的问题，对吧？如果那个人开始……我不用去处理它。要么逃跑，要么实际上，你知道，介入。天哪，我们很多人会担心做这件事。所以，你知道，嘿，那是他们的工作。当事情开始出错时，他们会介入，这意味着我不用。这是一种巨大的安慰。嗯，这是我们每天都依赖警察的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Jordans**: Um, I I mean, when it comes to perceptions, it can be tricky. Obviously, we want to be after the root causes. We want to try to reduce crime, but but certainly having police officers around, especially as Jennifer suggests, if if if you feel comfortable and connected to those officers, if if they have that community policing kind of vibe, what that does for us is if we're on the subway and there's some characters that we're a little unsure of again and we're getting a little scared because we don't know how they're going to act. You know, if there's an officer nearby, we know this is going to sound kind of nasty, but this is how society works. It's their problem, right? If that person starts to get whatever, I don't have to do something about it. Either escape or actually, you know, step in. God forbid. Many of us would be worried about doing that. So to know, hey, that's their job. When when things start to go wrong, they're going to step in and that means I don't have to. That's that's a huge level of comfort. Um, and it's what we rely on on officers for every day.

</details>

### 信息传递与公众信任

**主持人**: 我确实要问这个问题。詹妮弗，你显然不能代表任何警察部门发言。嗯，现在，特别是**多伦多警察局**，这是一个在2024年引起很多关注的部门，当时正是**入室盗窃**的高峰期。我不知道你是否听说了这个故事，但有一位警官建议居民把车钥匙放在门前，以避免与窃贼发生冲突。信息传递在这种情况下是如何发挥作用的？因为，你知道，对于很多听到这个信息的居民来说，就像史蒂夫说的，看到警察可能会想，“好吧，现在不是我的问题了，是他们的问题。”但如果警察在某些情况下也在推卸责任，那么安全感和对安全的感知就会被侵蚀。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I do have to ask this question. Now, Jennifer, you don't obviously uh speak for any police service. uh right now, specifically the Toronto Police Service, which is one uh service that got a lot of attention in 2024 when this was at the height of home invasions. And I don't know if you had heard the story, but there was a police officer that had suggested that residents leave their car keys um at the front of the door to avoid uh confrontation uh with thieves. How does messaging sort of play into this? Because one, you know, for for a lot of residents who heard that message, just like Steve said, seeing a police officer might be okay. Well, that's now not my problem. It's their problem. But if police are perhaps passing the puck in certain situations, that's that safety and that fe that perception of safety has eroded.

</details>

**詹妮弗·马格努斯**: 我很高兴你提到了这一点。我非常清楚那件事。在我那些还在当警察的朋友们中间，我们讨论过这件事。我不同意这种想法。你反而应该考虑安装**摄像头**，因为摄像头不仅让你感觉更安全，还能帮助警察确定是谁闯入或试图闯入你家。在我看来，提供安全建议会更好，而不是说把你的钥匙放在门前。这就像说，“干脆把门锁也别锁了”，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Magnus**: And I'm actually glad you brought that up. I'm well aware of that incident. And among my friends who continue to be police officers, we've discussed that. I disagree with that form of idea. You instead they should be looking at things like okay installing cameras because cameras not only make you feel safer, they help the police determine who maybe broke in or is trying to break into their place. Giving them ideas for safety would be a better idea in my view than saying leave your key fob at the front door. Like it's akin to saying just leave your door unlocked,

</details>

**主持人**: 对吧？然后说“ pretty much 来拿你想要的东西，你就没事了”。我认为这会在公众中造成这种敌意，当他们看到警察似乎在推卸责任时。就像“这不是我们的问题。让他们拿走他们需要的东西，然后继续生活吧。”但是，正如史蒂夫所说，我也提到过，当有人闯入你的家时，那是对你个人空间的侵犯，这会造成长期的创伤和恐惧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: right? and say pretty much come in and take what you want and you're good. And I think that creates this animosity amongst the public when they see the police are almost passing the buck. Like it's not our problem. Just let them take what they need and then get on with your life. But like Steve said and I alluded to, when someone breaks into your home, that's a violation of your personal space and that creates a level of trauma and fear for a long time after.

</details>

### 应对焦虑

**主持人**: 好的，我们还有不到一分钟的时间，我想了解一下，史蒂夫，人们对社区的犯罪感到焦虑，他们应该如何应对？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right, we have about uh just under a minute or so and I want to to get a sense if people are feeling anxious, Steve, about crime in their communities. How should they try to navigate around them?

</details>

**史蒂夫·乔丹斯**: 嗯，一般来说，信息很重要。嗯，詹妮弗建议去参加骑警体验。我不知道，我们任何人都可以去参加骑警体验吗？如果可以的话，那太酷了。但是，我认为，了解警方正在做出的努力，以及你和你的社区可能如何……你知道，我们能想到过去的**邻里守望计划**之类的事情，但实际上，与邻居联系并说“嘿，这里有点问题，我们能不能一起努力，关注社区，如果有什么不对劲就互相告知”，这其中有很大的安全感。我认为这是一种社区努力，可以让你感觉更安全。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steve Jordans**: Um I mean generally information is great. Um Jennifer suggested going on a ride along. I I don't know. Can any of us just go on a ride along? That's kind of [laughter] cool if we can. But but I think you know getting a sense of the efforts that that the police are making and how you and potentially your neighborhood you know you can we think of old neighborhood watch programs and things like that but but literally there's a lot of security in that social connection that even comes from reaching out to your neighbors and saying you know hey, there's a bit of an issue here can can we work together and have eyes on the neighborhood and and let each other know if anything seems up. You know feeling like that's that's part of a a community effort I think can help you feel a lot more secure.

</details>

**詹妮弗·马格努斯**: 我还会补充一点，教育自己了解**法院系统**以及个人是如何被释放的。理解这个过程，理解警察是如何运作的，就像我再说一遍，看到他们如何工作，这可以大大提高社会安全感，因为他们看到确实有正在遵循和执行的程序。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jennifer Magnus**: I would also adding on to that, educating yourself about the court systems and how individuals are released. Understanding that process, understanding how police function and like I go back to seeing how they do their job can go a long way and making society feel safer because they see there actually is processes that are being followed and done.

</details>

**主持人**: 我们就到这里吧。詹妮弗，史蒂夫，非常感谢你们的见解。非常感谢。

**Host**: When the students leave Salem Chapel, I want them to understand that black Canadians, so early black Canadians, beginning from our arrival, and in this area, we're looking at 1780, helped contribute to the construction or the development of Canada, of this great nation. And and we all know it. We're written out of the history books. So, a lot of people don't even know about our existence. But that's what we want the takeaway to be, how important we are to this country and our value. Of course,
