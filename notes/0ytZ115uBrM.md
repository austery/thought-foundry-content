summary: 本周市场波动，政府停摆结束但部分数据缺失。美联储12月降息概率降至50%，因官员鹰派言论及对通胀和就业市场的不确定性。同时，AI叙事出现裂痕，部分AI公司信用违约互换利差扩大，且知名空头Michael
  Burry质疑科技公司GPU折旧期限过长，可能虚报利润。尽管如此，大型科技公司现金流充裕，市场仍可能受数据和财报影响迎来年底反弹。

title: 市场周报：美联储降息前景与AI叙事中的裂痕
---

### 市场概览与本周焦点

大家好，今天是11月15日，这是本周的市场周报。过去一周，市场再次经历了激动人心的时刻。我们终于迎来了美国历史上最长的**政府停摆**（Government Shutdown）的结束。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello my friends. Today is November 15th and this is Markets Weekly. So this past week was another exciting week in markets. We had finally the end of the government shutdown, the longest in US history.</p>
</details>

我们也得知，一些错失的数据发布可能永远无法看到。因此，我们可能永远无法得知10月份就业市场的情况，也不会有10月份的**CPI**（Consumer Price Index: 衡量消费者购买商品和服务价格变化的指标）数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we also learned that some of the data that uh releases that we missed we may never see. So we are probably never going to find out what happened to the jobs market in October nor will we have an October CPI. Um</p>
</details>

从股市来看，这也是波动剧烈的一周。本周早些时候市场出现反弹，但临近周末，我们经历了很大的波动，周四大幅下跌。周五，**标普500指数**（S&P 500: 美国股市的基准指数）再次测试了**50日移动平均线**（50-day moving average: 衡量资产价格短期趋势的技术指标），并从中反弹。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">looking at the equity markets, it was also a volatile week. We rallied earlier in the week, but towards the end of the week, you know, we we kind of um had a lot of volatility, big declines on Thursday. On Friday, we once again tested the 50-day moving average on the S&P 500, bounced off of it,</p>
</details>

请记住，我们正处于一年中季节性积极的时期，而**圣诞老人行情**（Santa Rally: 指每年年底股市通常出现的上涨趋势）是真实存在的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and remember, we are in a seasonally positive part of the year, and that Christmas Santa rally is a real thing.</p>
</details>

目前看来，标普500指数和更广泛的市场受到两件事的影响。首先，当然是**美联储**（Federal Reserve: 美国中央银行）12月降息的可能性正在降低。其次，一直以来是股市主要驱动力的AI叙事中，正在出现裂痕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now it seems like the S&P 500 and broader markets were upset by two things. First off, of course, was that it looks like a Fed December cut is becoming less likely. And secondly, there are cracks emerging in the AI narrative, which has been a big driver in the equity market.</p>
</details>

所以今天，我们来谈两件事。首先，我们来讨论为什么市场目前只消化了12月降息50%的可能性，以及AI叙事中出现了哪些裂痕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So today, let's talk about two things. First off, let's talk about why the market is uh pricing in only a 50% chance of a December rate cut and what the cracks are in the AI narrative.</p>
</details>

### 美联储降息前景：从确定到不确定

我们从美联储开始。让我们稍微回顾一下。在9月份的**FOMC会议**（Federal Open Market Committee Meeting: 美国联邦公开市场委员会会议，决定货币政策）之后，市场消化了12月100%降息的可能性。为什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Starting with the Fed. Now, let's rewind a little bit. Now, after the September FOMC meeting, the markets were pricing in a 100% chance of a December rate cut. Why?</p>
</details>

那是因为美联储在9月份基本上对此进行了指引。请记住，在9月份，我们得到了**点阵图**（Dot Plot: 美联储官员对未来利率预测的图表）。如果你看点阵图上的点，每个点都显示了一位美联储官员认为年底利率会是多少，你会发现大多数官员都倾向于12月降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it's because the the Fed basically guided towards that in September. Remember, in September, we got a dot plot. And if you look at the dots on the dot plot where each dot shows where a Fed official thinks rates would be at the end of the year, you'll see that a majority were guiding towards a December rate cut.</p>
</details>

但并非所有人都如此。这不是一个非常大的多数。有相当一部分人认为今年可能只需要一到两次降息。但无论如何，市场看到了点阵图，基本上认为12月会降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But not all. It was uh you know, it wasn't a very big majority. You had a sizable uh plurality that thought that maybe we just need one or two cuts this year. But in any case, the market saw the dot block and was basically thinking that yeah, we're going to get a December rate cut.</p>
</details>

转到最近的10月份会议，**鲍威尔**（Powell）发表了非常令人难忘且强硬的言论。他是这样说的：“在本次会议的委员会讨论中，对于12月如何推进，存在强烈分歧的观点。12月会议上进一步降低政策利率并非板上钉钉。远非如此。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Moving on to the most recent October meeting, Pawa had very, very memorable and strong words. Here's what he said. In the committee's discussions at this meeting, there were strongly differing views about how to proceed in December. A further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion. Far from it.</p>
</details>

因此，鲍威尔基本上强烈地向市场暗示，他当时至少没有足够的支持来指引12月降息。似乎有很多人强烈反对12月降息，因此他基本上对此进行了反驳，于是12月降息的几率逐渐下降。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Powell was basically strongly telegraphing to the market that he did not have uh enough support at least at that time uh to guide towards a December rate cut. There seems to be a lot of vocal opposition to a December rate cut and so he basically pushed back against it and so December rate cut odds gradually faded.</p>
</details>

### 美联储内部的分歧与外部数据挑战

过去一周，我们听到了更多美联储官员的讲话，特别是更多美联储官员发表了非常**鹰派**（Hawkish: 指货币政策倾向于收紧，通常通过提高利率来控制通胀）的言论。他们基本上说的是：“我们不认为应该降息。我们应该基本上观望。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, this past week, we got a lot more Fed speakers, specifically a lot more Fed presence speaking, who were sounding a very hawkish note. Now, what they were saying is basically that, you know, I don't think we should cut rates. We should basically wait and see.</p>
</details>

从他们的角度来看，他们担心通胀，并认为劳动力市场状况尚可。现在，如果你再次查看数据（这可能会有点过时，但这是我们从政府那里得到的最新官方数据），你可以看到美联储处于一种困境。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">From their perspective, they were worried about inflation and they felt that the labor market was was okay. Now if you look at uh this the data again this is going to be out of data a little bit but it's the most recent official data we get from uh from the government you can see that the Fed is in kind of a difficult situation.</p>
</details>

一方面，通胀已经停滞在2.7%左右一段时间了，并没有真正下降。另一方面，失业率却在逐渐攀升。所以，他们正处于事物向相反方向发展的时候，他们不确定通胀会走向何方，因为有些人担心**关税**（Tariffs: 政府对进口商品征收的税费）实际上会推高通胀。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On the one hand inflation has been stuck around say 2.7% for some time. It really hasn't been going anywhere. On the other hand you see the unemployment rate gradually creep up. So they are at a time where things are moving in opposite directions and they're not really sure um where inflation will be because some of them are afraid that tariffs will actually move inflation higher</p>
</details>

他们也不确定劳动力市场会如何表现，因为我们有人口增长的变化，而今年早些时候我们看到的疲弱就业数据可能部分是由于人口增长放缓。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and they're not really sure how the labor market will perform because you know we have this changes in population growth whereas the weak job numbers we saw earlier in the year could be in part due to just slower population growth.</p>
</details>

他们不确定的第三个维度是货币政策的限制性程度，例如4%或3.8%的联邦基金利率。这在今天是否具有限制性？有些人会说，经济在现在和疫情前世界之间已经发生了变化，所以我们现在所处的位置并不是超级限制性的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And a third dimension that they're really not afraid of, not sure of is how restrictive is monetary policy is say a 4% 3.8% Fed funds rate. Is that restrictive today? Some people uh will will say that you know the economy has changed between now and the preandemic world and so where we are now not super restrictive</p>
</details>

还有一些人会说，那些使中性利率保持在低位的结构性力量仍然存在。因此，我们仍然相当具有限制性。所以我们有各种不确定性，此外还有不同的风险承受能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and you have other people who would say that you know the structural forces that kept u the neutral rate low are still there. And so uh we are still pretty restrictive. So we have all sorts of uncertainty and on top of that different risk tolerances.</p>
</details>

有些人对通胀高于目标更加敏感，因为它已经高于目标好几年了。所有这些困惑最终导致市场认为美联储12月降息的几率只有50/50。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some people are just have a a lot more sensitive to inflation um being above target since it has been above target for uh a number of years. So all this confusion is ending up to the market just saying that hey 50/50% of a Fed December rate cut</p>
</details>

而且，股市的部分热情似乎至少部分是由于市场处于一种狂热状态，美联储实际上将降息，并且肯定会扩大其资产负债表，所以让我们狂欢吧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and a lot it seems at least part of the enthusiasm in equity markets has been due to the fact that hey markets are kind of in a mania fed's actually going to be cutting into it and for sure expanding their balance sheet so let's party on.</p>
</details>

现在，这在历史上其实相当奇怪。通常当我们有这些大的狂热时，比如在互联网泡沫时期或1920年代，央行实际上是在加息。这并不是为了试图戳破泡沫，尽管这可能在其中发挥作用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now this is actually historically quite strange. Uh usually when we have these big mania, let's say during the.com or during the 1920s, we have the central bank actually raising rates. Not so much to try to pop the bubble, although that may play a role in it.</p>
</details>

但通常当你有强劲的股市时，你也会有强劲的经济。目前似乎并非如此。现在，从我的角度来看，我认为所有这些鹰派言论都非常奇怪，因为如果你在9月份是**鸽派**（Dovish: 指货币政策倾向于宽松，通常通过降低利率来刺激经济），那么从那时到现在，我们并没有很多官方数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But usually when you have strong stock markets, you also have a strong economy. Uh it just doesn't seem to be the case at the moment. Now, from my perspective, I think all this hawkish talk is really, really strange because, you know, if you were kind of dovish in September, between then and now, we really haven't had a lot of official data.</p>
</details>

所以，你没有很好的数据来改变你的想法。而且我认为同样重要的是，政府停摆本身就是一个逆风。你有所有这些无所事事的政府工作人员，以及依赖他们赞助的行业也无所事事，还有所有这些影响航空公司的航班中断等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you know, you haven't had good data to change your mind. And I think just as importantly, the government shutdown itself is a headwind, right? You had, you know, all these government workers who weren't doing anything, industries that were reliant upon their patronage, not doing anything and all these flight disruptions that are, you know, impacting airlines and so forth.</p>
</details>

现在，政府停摆带来的一些经济放缓会随着政府工作人员获得补发工资并消费这些钱而逆转，但其中一些损失将永远无法挽回。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, a lot of the economic slowdowns from the government shutdown will reverse as uh government workers get back pay and spend that money, but some of that will will be lost and never come back, right?</p>
</details>

如果你是一名政府工作人员，每天在你办公室附近的当地餐馆买一份三明治，你不会回去买两份三明治来弥补。那家餐馆老板永远也无法收回那笔损失的收入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And if you were a government worker, let's say buying a sandwich at a local restaurant by your office every day, uh you're not going to go back and buy two sandwiches instead. That restaurant owner is just never going to get that lost revenue back.</p>
</details>

所以，如果你面临这些逆风，似乎你至少会继续保持你的鸽派倾向。当然没有理由转向鹰派。然而，我们确实有一些美联储官员似乎已经转向了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if you had these headwinds, it would seem that you would, you know, at least continue your doubbish bias. There's certainly no reason to to um switch to hawkishness. And and yet we do have some Fed presence who seem to have switched.</p>
</details>

不过，归根结底，最直言不讳的鹰派是美联储主席，他们中许多人目前甚至没有投票权。更重要的人物，美联储理事们，仍然有非常强大的派别倾向于鸽派。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, at the end of the day though, the most vocal uh hawks are Fed presidents and many of them don't even vote at the moment. The more important people, the Fed governors, there's still a very strong contingency there that are leaning doubbish.</p>
</details>

**莫兰理事**（Governor Moran），我猜想其他特朗普任命的官员也倾向于12月降息。我怀疑纽约联储主席**约翰·威廉姆斯**（John Williams）也是如此。而且我认为**鲍威尔**（Powell）可能也倾向于降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Governor Moran, I would assume that um the other Trump appointees are also leaning towards a cut a cut in December. I suspect that John Williams, president of the New York Fed, is as well. And I think that Pablo probably is leaning towards a cut as well.</p>
</details>

所以归根结底，我仍然认为12月降息的可能性很大，特别是如果即将公布的数据弱于预期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So at the end of the day, I I think it's still it's still likely that we would get a U December cut, especially if the data that comes in uh is weaker than than expected.</p>
</details>

### 关税对经济影响的再思考

我还想强调一件事，那就是旧金山联储发布了一项全新的研究，**《华尔街日报》**（The Wall Street Journal）的**尼克·蒂米劳斯**（Nick Timiraos）对此进行了重点报道。这项研究表明，通过回顾150年的历史，关税实际上是**反通胀**的，并会提高失业率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One thing I'll also highlight is that we have this brand new research out of the San Francisco Fed that Nick Turos of the Wall Street Journal highlighted and that's showing that tariffs are actually uh disinflationary and raise unemployment rates looking through 150 years of history</p>
</details>

原因当然很简单。关税基本上是一种税，当你增加税收时，会减缓经济增长，这当然意味着需求减少，失业率上升，通胀下降。这种组合通常会导致更多的货币政策宽松。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and the reason of course is really simple. Tariffs are basically a tax and when you increase taxes that slows down the economy which of course you have less demand that means unemployment rate goes up and inflation goes down which usually combination would lead to um more monetary policy easing.</p>
</details>

所以所有关于关税推高通胀，从而美联储应该保持更鹰派的说法，在数据中并没有得到支持。到目前为止，我认为**FOMC**（Federal Open Market Committee: 联邦公开市场委员会）中越来越多的人开始意识到，鹰派们不确定他们在看什么，但他们有很多时间在数据中改变主意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So all these talk about tariffs pushing up inflation so that the Fed should stay more hawkish that's you know just not supported in in data and so far I think more of more and more people on the FOMC are becoming to realize that the hawks not really sure what they're looking at but uh a lot of time in the data for them to change their mind.</p>
</details>

### AI叙事中的裂痕：债券市场担忧

好的，我想谈的第二件事是AI叙事中的裂痕。正如我们之前讨论的，AI是推动市场走高的因素。公司为此投入了数千亿美元。目前尚不清楚他们将如何从中赚钱，但这并不能阻止股市。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right the second thing I want to talk about is cracks in the AI narrative. So again, as we've talked about before, AI is the thing that's driving markets higher. Companies spending hundreds and hundreds of billions on it. Not really clear how they're going to make money off of it, but you know, that doesn't stop the equity market.</p>
</details>

今年股市中出现的两个裂痕是某些AI公司的**CDS**（Credit Default Swaps: 信用违约互换，一种信用衍生品，用于对冲债券违约风险）利差增加，这表明债券投资者对AI叙事存在一些担忧。其次，由于**折旧费用**（Depreciation Expense: 将资产成本在其使用寿命内分摊的会计处理），从盈利角度来看，存在更多担忧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the two cracks emerging in the equity market this year are increases in the CDS, so credit default swaps for certain AI companies, suggesting some concern from bond investors about the AI narrative. And secondly, you have um I guess more concern from the earnings perspective uh due to uh depreciation charges.</p>
</details>

这一点是由著名空头**迈克尔·布里**（Michael Burry）提出的，他当然因预测2008年金融危机中的抵押贷款危机而闻名。有一部关于他的电影，**克里斯蒂安·贝尔**（Christian Bale）在其中饰演迈克尔·布里，那是一部好电影。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And this was raised by famed shortseller Michael Blurry who was of course famous for calling the uh mortgage bust in the 2008 financial crisis. There's a movie made about it as well. Uh Christian Bale plays Michael Bry there. It's a good movie.</p>
</details>

现在，我们首先来谈谈债券市场中AI的裂痕。在过去几周，我们看到**甲骨文**（Oracle）和**Coreweave**的CDS利差显著扩大，这两家公司都参与了AI的建设热潮。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, first let's talk about the cracks in the AI from the bond market. So over the past uh few weeks we see that the CDS spreads for Oracle and for Coreweave which are two companies that are engaged in the AI buildup boom basically widen significantly</p>
</details>

CDS本质上是针对其债券违约的保险费，所以当CDS利差扩大时，意味着投资者要求更高的保险费协议。这意味着投资者对这些公司债务违约的担忧正在增加。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and what that what a CDS is it's basically uh insurance premium for default on their bonds and so when CDS spreads widen that means investors are demanding uh that means insurance premium agreements are going higher. That means investors are getting more concerned about uh these companies defaulting on their debt.</p>
</details>

我们之前谈过甲骨文，他们最近的财报发布后，股价出现了惊人的飙升。在那份财报中，他们指引了大量的AI相关建设。他们将建造所有这些数据中心，并出售他们与AI公司签订的计算服务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, Oracle, we've talked about before, they had a just a tremendous mind-blowing rally from their most recent earnings report. At that earnings report, they guided towards tremendous amounts of u AI related buildout. They were going to build all these data centers and, you know, sell this compute that they had contracted out with AI companies.</p>
</details>

因此，大规模的AI建设，大规模的AI计算合同，他们的股票基本上飞涨。这些都是未来的承诺，如果你对此持怀疑态度，我认为是可以理解的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so massive AI buildout, massive AI contracts for compute and you know their stock basically went to the moon and uh these are all promises in the future and and if you were to uh find to be a bit skeptical I think it'd be understandable</p>
</details>

但无论如何，为了提供所有这些计算服务，他们显然必须投入大量资金并建造数据中心。其中一部分资金是通过债务市场融资的。所以他们去借了一些钱，并开始建造数据中心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but in anyway in order to provide all that compute obviously they have to spend a lot of money and build out data centers. Part of that money was financed in the debt market. So they went and borrowed some money and started are starting to build data centers.</p>
</details>

现在，如果你是一名为这些债务提供融资的债券市场投资者，你可能会更加怀疑，因为为了让你得到偿还，数据中心的支出实际上必须产生足以覆盖其融资成本的收入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now if you are a bond market investor financing that debt again you're going to be a bit more spec skeptical uh because in order for you to be repaid that data center spending actually has to generate revenue that covers its financing costs.</p>
</details>

所以，债券市场投资者真正关心的是能否获得偿还。他们没有股权投资者那样的巨大上涨空间。因此，似乎一些债券市场投资者开始担心，这些AI数据中心可能无法产生足够的现金流来偿还他们，所以他们有点担心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you know bond market investors they really cared about being repaid. They don't have that to the moon upside that equity investors would have. And so it seems like some of the bond market investors are becoming concerned that hey maybe these AI data centers might not generate enough cash flow to repay me and so I'm getting a bit concerned.</p>
</details>

这再次是对AI将成为改变世界的巨大事物的信念中的一个裂痕。类似的Coreweave公司，也从事数据中心建设业务，其信用违约互换利差也扩大了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again that's a crack in the belief that AI is just going to be this huge thing that's going to change the world. A similar company Core which also of course is in in the business of building data centers also saw their credit spot swaps widen.</p>
</details>

所以，这是AI叙事中的一些裂痕，但我必须提醒大家，大部分AI支出是由**超大规模云服务商**（Hyperscalers: 指提供大规模云计算服务的公司，如Meta、Google、Amazon）等公司通过其现金流来融资的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that is some crack in the AI narrative but I have to remind everyone that uh the bulk of the AI spending is financed from the hyperscalers like Meta, Google, Amazon and so forth, Facebook and these guys are paying for most of their AI spending from their cash flows and they generate enormous amounts of cash.</p>
</details>

他们是世界上一些最成功的公司，产生巨额现金。他们正在利用这些现金来建设AI相关设施。其中一些，他们也有一些债务，但当然他们产生了如此多的现金，并且是如此成功的业务，这没什么好担心的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They are the uh actually some of the world's most successful companies generate huge amounts of cash. They're taking that cash and uh building AI stuff. Some of it, you know, they have some debt as well, but of course they generate so much cash and such successful businesses, not something to worry about.</p>
</details>

所以，更大的图景是，外围出现了一些裂痕，但实际上，大型科技公司，那些超大规模云服务商，他们仍然很好。你可以争辩说，如果把现金花在数据中心上，就没有现金用于股票回购，但到目前为止，他们似乎通过裁员来节省资金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the bigger picture is that, you know, you have some cracks on the periphery, but really the big part of the sorry uh the Mac 7, the hyperscalers, these guys, uh they're still fine. Um, you can make an argument that if you spend cash on data centers, you don't have cash for stock buybacks, but it seems like they are saving money by cutting headcount so far anyway.</p>
</details>

当然，本周我们将听到**英伟达**（Nvidia）的财报，这将真正帮助我们更好地理解这一叙事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And of course, we get to hear from Nvidia this week, which will really help us understand the narrative better.</p>
</details>

### AI叙事中的裂痕：折旧会计问题

正在出现的第二个裂痕与这些科技公司是否正确核算其**折旧费用**（Depreciation Expense: 将资产成本在其使用寿命内分摊的会计处理）有关，这是由**迈克尔·布里**（Michael Burry）提出的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, the second crack that's emerging has to do with um whether or not these tech companies are properly accounting for their depreciation expense and this was raised by Michael Blurry.</p>
</details>

那么，什么是折旧费用？如果你购买一项实物资产，比如说你买了一套出租房，它花了50万美元。每年你获得租金收入，比如说5万美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, what is depreciation expense? So, if you buy a physical asset, let's say that actually you buy a rental home, it costs $500,000 to buy it. And every year you get rental income, let's say uh $50,000 in rental income.</p>
</details>

所以，出于税收目的，这5万美元的租金收入并非纯收入，因为你有获得它的成本。你实际上买了一套房子，而这套房子的成本必须在其使用寿命内分摊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, when you for tax purposes, that 50,000 in rental income isn't pure income because you have cost you have costs to uh obtain it. you you actually you bought a house and that housing cost has to be spent over uh the lifespan the useful life of the house.</p>
</details>

现在，房子的使用寿命，你知道，它会是……但从会计目的来看，假设是20年或25年。无论如何，你将折旧成本除以折旧寿命，这就是你的年度折旧成本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now the useful life of the house you it's you know it's it's going to be but from accounting purposes let's say that it's um you know let's say it's 20 years 25 years in any in any case you divide the depreciation lifespan and that is your annual depreciation cost.</p>
</details>

这是你为了产生5万美元租金收入而发生的成本。所以当你有更高的折旧时，你的收入就会更低，因为你将更多的实际资产成本分配到收入中，以抵消收入。

<p class="english-text">That's costs that you incurred in order to generate that $50,000 in rental income. And so when you have higher depreciation, you have lower income uh because uh you're allocating more of that real asset cost uh to the income to against the income.</p>
</details>

目前，许多公司正在购买大量的**GPU**（Graphics Processing Unit: 图形处理器，在AI计算中扮演关键角色），并给予它们大约五年的折旧期。所以，如果你在GPU上花费100美元，假设你每年记录25美元或20美元的成本。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Now at the moment, a lot of these guys are buying a tremendous amounts of GPUs and are giving them a depreciation schedule of about five years. So, if you spend $100 on your GPU, let's say that every year you're recording $25 uh $20 of cost against that.</p>
</details>

所以，假设你从你的AI数据中心产生了100美元的收入。你唯一的成本是你的GPU。现在，你记录了20美元的GPU成本折旧。这基本上是说你必须购买一个GPU才能获得那笔收入。那是一个成本。

<details>

<p class="english-text">So, uh let's say you made $100 in revenue from your AI data center. Your only cost is your GPU. Now, you record $20 of GPU cost depreciation against that. That's basically saying that you had to buy a GPU to get that revenue. That's a cost.</p>
</details>

GPU的使用寿命大约是五年。所以你只是说，每年20美元的成本。GPU的使用寿命越长，你每年获得的折旧就越少，所以你的收益看起来就越大。

<details>

<p class="english-text">the GPU has a useful lifespan about five years. And so you're just saying that, hey, let's do a $20 cost a year. The longer the lifespan of the GPU, the smaller the depreciation you get each year, and so the bigger your earnings look.</p>
</details>

现在，**迈克尔·布里**（Michael Burry）提出的观点是，这些大型科技公司提出的或正在使用的GPU寿命太长了。因为它们太长了，折旧费用就太低了。所以他们没有正确核算他们在获得收入时发生的费用，从而人为地提高了他们的利润。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Now, what Michael Blurry is suggesting is that the GPU lifespans that are being proposed or being used by these big tech companies are too long. And because they're too long, the depreciation charge is too low. So they're not properly accounting for the expenses they are incurring in getting their revenue and artificially boosting their profits.</p>
</details>

这是一个合乎逻辑的论点。所以当我看到电脑，当我看到GPU时，你知道，通常技术进步很快。所以五年的寿命可能不是非常合理。也许是三年，也许是四年。很难说。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now that's a logical argument. So when I look at computers, when I look at GPUs, you know, usually technology progresses pretty quickly. So a 5year lifespan probably not super reasonable. Maybe it's 3 years, maybe it's four years. It's hard to say</p>
</details>

英伟达每年都会推出新的GPU，所以你的旧GPU可能会更快地过时。现在，其他人会说，即使是旧的GPU仍然可以100%使用，因为它们可以完成更简单的任务，所以五年的寿命是合适的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">um Nvidia is going to come up with a new GPU say every year and so maybe your old GPU becomes obsolete faster. Now other people would say that even old GPUs are still used at a 100% because they can do you know simpler tasks and so a 5year lifespan is appropriate.</p>
</details>

这同样很难说。但是，如果你认为折旧期太长，那么你会认为他们夸大了利润，那么如果利润被夸大了，这对他们的股票应该是负面的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again this is all hard to say. Uh but if you think that depreciation is too long then you would assume that they are overstating their profits and then the stock uh you know if the profits are overstated that should be negative for their stocks.</p>
</details>

但当然，我们都知道得更清楚，对吧？股票可以没有盈利，仍然涨到天上。但如果你像**迈克尔·布里**（Michael Burry）一样是一个基本面投资者，你会指出这样的事情，这完全是合理和有效的。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Uh but of course we all know better right uh stocks can have no earnings and still go to the roof. But if you're a fundamental investor like Michael Blurry again uh you would point towards things like that and that is totally legitimate, totally valid.</p>
</details>

但目前盈利似乎并没有那么重要。所以这些关于GPU利润夸大以及AI叙事中信用担忧的担忧，似乎也稍微动摇了信心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But uh earnings don't really seem to matter all that much at the moment. And so these concerns about the overstating of the GPUs and of the um credit concerns in the AI narrative seem to have shaken confidence a little bit as well.</p>
</details>

### 市场展望与潜在走势

所以这似乎就是正在发生的事情。下周我们有很多值得期待的事情。我们有一些原定要发布的数据。我们将获得9月份的**NFP数据**（Non-Farm Payrolls Data: 非农就业数据，衡量美国非农业部门就业人数变化），我们还将获得英伟达的财报。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So that seems to be what's happening. Now next week we have a lot to look forward to. We have data that um was supposed to be released. We're going to get the September NFP data and we're going to get Nvidia earnings.</p>
</details>

现在，在我们对市场过于悲观之前，我们确实似乎正在失去一点动能。你知道，你可能会有一个非常清晰的路径，比如说英伟达完全没问题，就像它通常那样，再次确认AI叙事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now before we get too bearish on the market, we do seem to be losing a little bit of momentum. You know, you could have a very clear path where say that Nvidia is totally okay, as it usually is, reaffirming the AI narrative.</p>
</details>

而且数据可能会弱于预期。这将使12月降息重新回到台面上，然后你很容易就能看到季节性效应开始发挥作用，到年底我们可能会看到标普500达到7000点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and you could have data come in weaker than expected going forward. that puts a December rate cut back on the table and then you know you could easily see uh the seasonal effects kick in and uh see us at 7,000 by the end of the year.</p>
</details>

在我个人看来，这很可能是一条路径，当然我们也可能下跌。所以无论如何，下周将非常重要。让我们关注英伟达，看看数据会带来什么。好的，下周再和大家聊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That is in my personal view probably a pretty likely path and of course we could also go down. So in any case next week will be very important. Let's watch Nvidia and let's see what the data brings. All right, talk to you guys next week.</p>
