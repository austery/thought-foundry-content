### 信念与初心

**旁白**: 要想真正改变事物，要建立伟大的事业，你必须拥有信念。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: In order to truly change things, in order to build something great, you must have conviction.

</details>

**旁白**: 一个大学辍学的扑克玩家。我没上过哈佛或 MIT。我没上过，你知道，很棒的学校。我没有任何人脉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: A college dropout poker player. I didn't go to Harvard or MIT. I didn't go to, you know, amazing school. I didn't have any connections.

</details>

**Raz**: 我们曾是无名小卒。所以我一直想证明我们可以做到不可能的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Raz**: We were nobodyies. And so I always wanted to prove that we could do impossible things.

</details>

**旁白**: “你做不到这个。”“没人能做到。”当我听到这些话时，嗯，那正是我想要着手解决的一切。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: You can't do this. Nobody can. When I hear that, uh, that's all I want to work on.

</details>

**旁白**: 推倒重来。从第一性原理出发，彻底思考。我该如何打破它？我该如何打破它？而“为什么”比任何事情都重要。我们为何在此？我们为何起床？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Reset everything. Think completely from first principles. How can I break it? How can I break it? And that the why matters more than anything. Why are we here? Why why do we get up in the morning

</details>

**旁白**: 睡前，在淋浴时，半夜醒来，你有一个想法，这就像是一种纯粹的痴迷。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: in the shower when you're going to bed at night, when you wake up in the middle of the night, you have an idea is just like it's just a pure obsession.

</details>

**旁白**: 我们能否兼具高性能和最大化去中心化？这是圣杯。不可能的事，一个不可能的问题。我最喜欢的那种。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Can we have high performance and maximum decentralization? It's the holy grail. The impossible thing, an impossible problem. My favorite.

</details>

**旁白**: 曾经只是一个想法，如今已成为现实。我们是历史上第一家同时获得 Andre Horwitz 和 Sequoia 领投的公司。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: What started as an idea now is a reality. We were the first company ever in history to have both Andre Horwitz and Sequoia both co-lead around.

</details>

**旁白**: Vitalic 说过那个三难问题（trilemma）是行不通的。他的意思是理论上行不通，但我们实际做到了。不再有瓶颈。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Narrator**: Vitalic said that trial was broken. He means theoretically it's broken, but we actually broke it. There were no more bottlenecks.

</details>

**Brian Pellegro**: 我是 Brian Pellegro，Layer Zero Labs 的联合创始人兼 CEO。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Pellegro**: I'm Brian Pelgro, co-founder and CEO of Layer Zero Labs.

</details>

**Raz**: 我是 Raz，Layer Zero 的联合创始人兼 CTO。Zero 是最后一个将被构建的区块链。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Raz**: I'm Raz, co-founder and CTO of Layer Zero. Zero is the last blockchain that'll ever be built.

</details>

### 从扑克到加密货币：机遇与信念的萌芽

**Brian Pellegro**: 我在一个早上醒来，4 月 15 日，然后坐在电脑前，屏幕上是司法部（DOJ）的一个大印章。发生的事情是，一夜之间，他们禁止了美国境内所有的在线扑克。所有的网站都下线了。你不能在美国玩在线扑克了。所有的支付处理商都下线了。所以，你不能再进行资金转移或做任何事情了。一夜之间，这个行业就消失了。我想那是你第一次看到政策和政府的影响力真正触及你的现实生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Pellegro**: I woke up one morning, April 15th, and I sat down at my computer and there's a big seal of the Department of Justice, the DOJ, on the website. And what had happened was overnight they had banned all online poker within the United States. All of the websites are down. You can no longer play online poker in the United States. All of the payment processors are down. So, you can no longer move money between or do anything. And it was just like overnight like that the industry was just gone. And I think those were the first times where you said okay you saw the reach of of sort of policy and government sort of impacting you in your real life.

</details>

**Brian Pellegro**: 当你还是个孩子时，你不会想太多。当你还是个年轻人时，你也不会想太多，但这是我第一次真正需要搬家，我的整个生活，我的职业生涯就这样被剥夺了。嗯，所以我想那确实让我早期就坚定了类似加密货币的自由主义精神，以及拥有一个比单一司法管辖区更宏大、比当前监管制度更强大的东西，它有潜力变得更强大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Pellegro**: When you're a kid you don't think about it too much. When you're a young adult you don't think about it but there's the first time of I need to literally move where I live to my entire life and it's sort of career just got taken away from me. Uh, and so I think that really grounded me early on in kind of like the libertarian ethos of crypto and having something that uh was bigger than a single jurisdiction, was bigger than a current like given regulatory regime uh had the ability to become something more.

</details>

**Brian Pellegro**: 在最初的 24 小时里，我只是沉浸在自怨自艾中，我想这是一种自然的反应。你只是会想，“哦，天哪，我的职业生涯结束了。我所有的钱都没了。”你知道，你真的不知道该做什么。但紧接着，第二天，我就醒了，我看到了世界正在迅速变化。我注意到的一件事是，所有主要的扑克网站都消失了，但还有一些小型、有点不正规的扑克网站仍然存在，每个人都会去注册，因为他们需要继续谋生。我认识世界上所有最高级别的扑克玩家。所以，我创建了一个联盟，把我所有的朋友都注册到了这些网站上。我为他们找到了最好的优惠，并协商了这些交易，我的收入从零变成了几周内每月赚取 2 到 3 万美元。所以，我很快就看到了，一个不断变化的格局重塑创造了机遇，这真的吸引了我投身创业。我认为那是第一个真正的催化剂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Pellegro**: For the first 24 hours, I just spent feeling sorry for myself, which I think is like a kind of natural reaction. You're just like, "Oh man, my my career is over. All my money is gone." Like, you know, you don't really know what to do. But then immediately after that, like the next day, I woke up and I was just very I saw that the world was changing very quickly. And so, one thing that I noticed was that all of the main poker sites were now gone, but there's a bunch of smaller kind of shady poker sites that still existed and that everybody was going to go and sign up on those because they needed to continue to make a living. And I knew all of the highest stakes poker players in the world. So, I created an affiliate and I signed up all of my friends to all of these sites. I found them the best deals and I negotiated these things and it went from me making, you know, no money to me making like 20 $30,000 a month within a couple of weeks, right? And so, very quickly I saw that a changing reshuffle of a landscape created an opportunity and then that really drew me to entrepreneurship in general. I think that was the first real catalyst.

</details>

**Brian Pellegro**: 我在一个只有 900 人居住的小镇长大，对吧？非常非常小的村庄，机会不多，什么都不多。所以我一生中都非常看重一个**精英主义**的环境。我没上过哈佛或 MIT。我没上过，你知道，很棒的学校。我没有任何人脉。我是一个大学辍学的扑克玩家，对吧？所以我真正看重的是，能够做一些事情，让我能够靠自己的方式赚钱，或者随着时间的推移证明自己的价值。所以扑克就是一个完美的例子。扑克完全是精英主义的。它不在乎你是谁。你就是比别人更聪明，或者更擅长这个游戏，或者你不是。就是这样。它非常非常线性。这些就是我所看重的系统和环境。所以，这也是我被**加密货币**吸引的原因之一。我不需要认识银行高管。我不需要有个在高盛工作的叔叔。我只需要能够构建出对世界更有用的东西，真正具有更高程度的实用性。就是构建出你能构建出的最好的系统，并对任何人开放，无需许可。就构建最好的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Pellegro**: I grew up in a town of 900 people, right? Like very very small village, not a lot of opportunity, not a lot of anything. And so I really valued for most of my life a meritocratic environment. I didn't go to Harvard or MIT. I didn't go to, you know, amazing school. I didn't have any connections. I was a poker player who dropped out of college, right? And so what I really valued was the ability to to just do something where I could earn my own way or like prove my own value over time. So poker was a perfect example of this. Poker is purely meritocratic. It doesn't matter anything about you. It's just you're smarter or better at the game or you're not. Like that's it. It was very very linear. Those are just the systems and environments that I valued. And so that was one of the things I was very drawn to in crypto. I didn't need to know the banking executives. I didn't need to have an uncle who worked at Goldman Sachs. All I needed to do was be able to build something that was more useful to the world that actually had a higher degree of utility. It was just build the best possible system that you can build and permissionless open access to anybody. Just build the best thing.

</details>

### 合作与挑战：LayerZero 的诞生

**Raz**: 你知道，我和 Brian 从小一起长大，一起学习。没有人愿意给我们钱，因为我们是无名小卒，我们没有显赫的家世，也没有名校背景。所以我一直想证明我们可以做到不可能的事情，伟大的事情。所以我总是在追逐当有人说某事不可能时，对吧？“这在技术上是不可能的。”“你做不到这个，没人能做到。”当我听到这些话时，嗯，那正是我想要着手解决的一切。Brian 是我们的英雄，我的英雄，我们年长学长们的英雄。他是个天才。所以我一直仰慕 Brian，想成为他那样的人。我当时不知道我们会在生活中，在余生中，一起工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Raz**: You know, I've been building with Brian since we're in school together. And nobody would give us money cuz we were nobodyies and we didn't come from a great pedigree and we didn't have a great school. And so I always wanted to prove that we could do impossible things, great things. And so I'm always chasing is when someone says something's not possible, right? This is not technically possible. this uh you you can't do this, nobody can. When I hear that, uh that's all I want to work on. And Brian was like uh our hero, like my hero, our like the older grade's heroes. He's a genius to everybody. And so I always looked at the Brian and I wanted to be like him. I didn't know we were going to do that uh to be be working together basically our whole lives, the rest of our lives.

</details>

**Raz**: 所以加密货币方面发生了两件事。所有的扑克网站，所有剩下的那些不正规的网站，唯一的存款方式就是通过 PayPal、Money Bookers、Netteller、Skril，它们都被关闭了，但 **Bitcoin** 是你存款到这些网站的方式。所以，2011 年左右在美国的每个扑克玩家都找到了 Bitcoin。每个人都用它作为存款方式。所以，这是第一个真正的**产品市场契合点**。然后，在创业方面，我对这个联盟想法产生了浓厚兴趣。这催生了一个新行业，叫做**日报幻想体育**（daily fantasy sport）。有点像它的加速版本。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Raz**: So two things happened through the crypto side. All of poker, all the shady sites that remained, the only way to deposit because PayPal, Money Bookers, Netteller, Skril, they were all shut down, but Bitcoin was the way that you would deposit to these sites. So, everybody in poker who was in the United States in 2011 era found Bitcoin. Everybody used it as a way to deposit between. So, it was the first real product market fit. And then on the entrepreneurship side, I'd got really interested by this affiliate idea. And that created a a doorway for a new industry which was called daily fantasy sport. Sort of a faster version of that.

</details>

**Raz**: 我去找他们说：“我能免费工作吗？让我做些联盟方面的事情吧。我想学习，让我看看这是怎么回事。”他们说：“当然，太好了。”然后公司董事会说：“嘿，我们实际上想让你在几个月内成为 CEO，并负责管理公司。”但我确实带上了我在这里的两位联合创始人，我和他们一起创立了 Layer Zero，我们一起发展，成为收入第三的公司。所以我们刚刚开始盈利，我们正在做这件事，然后我们收到了收购要约，我们就卖掉了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Raz**: I went to them and said, "Can I just work for free? Like just let me do some affiliate stuff. I want to learn uh let me just, you know, see how it is." And they said, "Sure, great." And then the sort of board of the company said, "Hey, we actually want you to become CEO a couple months and run the company." But I actually took my two co-founders here that I started layer zero with and I brought them in and we grew to being third overall in revenue. So we were just turning profitable. We were just doing this and then we got an acquisition offer and we sold it.

</details>

**Raz**: 那是我们生活中一段艰难的时期，就像我们第一次感受到真正的艰辛。一年半，也许两年，零收入，我每周工作 80 小时。嗯，我每天都在坚持，因为只有我们维护着一个拥有数万用户、真金白银在网站上玩的平台，而我们把赚到的每一分钱都投入了进去。我们赚钱并重新投资于业务，投资于服务器，再投资。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Raz**: It was a hard time like in our lives like that was a hard the first time we felt like real hardship. Year and a half maybe 2 years of zero income and me working 80our weeks. Uh, every day I was on because it was just us maintaining a site that had, you know, tens of thousands of users with real money playing on our site and us taking every dollar we made. We were making money and reinvesting into the business, reinvesting in the servers, reinvesting.

</details>

**Raz**: 我最大的收获，最大的体会是，我和 Brian 一起非常努力地工作。Brian 从不轻易放弃，我也不放弃，我一生中，我父亲总是教导我，永不放弃。这是我第一次感到，嗯，你知道，似乎毫无进展。我们没钱了。我当时是用我妻子的薪水自掏腰包来维持生计，和 Brian 一起。所以，我和 Brian，我们有一个报价，但那不是一个很好的报价，Brian 说我们不应该，我不认为我们应该接受。我说我必须接受。我们必须接受。我只是需要退出。我做不到了。那是我第一次退出。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Raz**: My biggest learning, the biggest takeaway was like I worked very hard with Brian on it. Brian doesn't really give up and I don't and my my whole life my father pushed me like never give up on things. And it was the first time where I I I felt like uh, you know, wasn't going anywhere. We were out of money. I was paying money out of pocket at this point from my wife's salary to like keep things alive with Brian. So was Brian and we had an offer and it wasn't a great offer and Brian said we shouldn't I don't think we should take it. And I said I have to take it. We have to take it. I just need to tap out at this point. Like I I can't do it. That was the first time I ever tapped out.

</details>

**Raz**: Brian 后来又来找我，说：“我真的、真的相信我们可以建立一些不可思议的东西，我向你保证，下次我们做任何事，我都会拼尽全力。你知道，我会承受最大的痛苦，我们不会轻易放弃。”我说：“好吧，我们这样做。”然后 **Ethereum** 大约在同一时间推出。Ethereum 是一个你可以信赖的伟大层，你可以在上面构建价值，但它很慢，而且你永远无法构建复杂的应用程序。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Raz**: Ryan actually came back to me later and said like, I really really believe that we can build something incredible and I promise you the next time that we do something, I will run my life into the ground. You know, I'll I'll I'll go all the way to maximum suffering and everything uh and we won't kind of give up early. And we said, okay, like we'll do that. And then Ethereum sort of was launching at the same time. Ethereum was this great layer that you could trust and you could build value upon, but it was slow and you could never build complex applications.

</details>

**Raz**: 这确实是现在可以构建一些真正有趣的东西的火花。我们很早就看到了这个需求。当然，你必须能够来回移动。你编写代码，然后将其托管在服务器上。也许服务器在我家，或者在数据中心，但它只是一个计算机，如果计算机宕机了，你的应用程序就离线了。所以你必须确保那台计算机在线，等等。但现在，当你构建一个应用程序时，你有数百万个微服务，你有数据库，有针对吞吐量、速度、每个不同组件进行优化的东西。我们看到区块链将真正开始利用这一点，你会有专门用于存储的层，有专门用于吞吐量和大量交易的层，有极其注重安全的层。并且有一种方法可以将它们全部连接起来，创造出比各部分之和更有价值的东西。所以我打电话给 Brian，我说：“我知道你说下次我们做任何事都会全力以赴。我想，现在是时候了。”我在圣诞节后两天打给他。在 10 天内，他卖掉了房子，打包了行李，带着他四个月大的女儿，飞越了半个地球来到温哥华，和我一起。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Raz**: It was really the spark of well now you can build something really interesting. We saw that need very early on of of course you have to be able to move back and forth. You write the code and you'd host it on a server. Maybe the server was in my house or maybe it was in a data center but it was just like one computer and if the computer went down like the website your application was offline you know so you had to make sure that computer was online and everything but now when you build an application you have a million microservices you have databases things that are optimized for throughput for speed for every different component and we saw blockchains will really start to leverage that you'll have layers that are really optimized for storage layers that are really optimized for throughput and for high amount bunch of transactions layer that are extremely security focused and there was a way to connect those all together to create something that was sort of more valuable than the sum of the parts. So I I called Ryan and I said like I know you said the next time we did something we would like really do it. I I was like, I think now is the time. And I called him two days after Christmas. And within 10 days, he had sold his house, packed up his life, taken his four-month old daughter, and flown across the world to come in Vancouver and be in Vancouver with me.

</details>

**Brian Pellegro**: 我想召集大家重聚，重新开始建设。我认为我们无法远程完成这件事。我说：“我两周内就到。”然后我就再也没搬回去。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Pellegro**: I want to I want to get the band back together and just start building again. I don't think we can do this remote. And I said, I'll be there in 2 weeks. And I never moved back.

</details>

**Brian Pellegro**: 我的女儿睡不好，她总是醒着。嗯，这实际上是最糟糕的时候去冒险，去做这些事情。那是我学习 **GPU** 的时候。每天早上，我会把女儿绑在背带上，在 Brian 楼下的客厅里走来走去。我读着 **Nvidia** 关于如何进行 GPU 编程的文档和一切，读着教科书，但没有真正动手实践，因为我做不到，我没有电脑。所以我只是在脑子里从凌晨 2 点到早上 7 点，连续 6 个月，每天都这样做。然后我坐下来，开始编写 GPU 代码。这是最糟糕的时期，但对我来说却是最好的时期。财务、压力、嗯，时间，还有，嗯，那就是我必须全力以赴的时候。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Pellegro**: My daughter didn't sleep well and she would be up all the time. Uh it was actually like the worst time to to go and take a shot and do these things. That's where I learned GPU. Every morning at I would strap my daughter in uh to these straps and I'd walk around Brian's downstairs living room. I would read the docs and everything about that Nvidia had on how to GPU program, read textbooks without doing the work cuz I couldn't I didn't have a computer. So I was just do it in my head from 2:00 in the morning to 7:00 in the morning every single day for 6 months. And then I sat down and just started coding GPU. It was the worst time to go, which is the best time for me. Finances, stress, um, time, and, uh, that's that's when like I have to hit my shot.

</details>

### 区块链的圣杯：高性能与去中心化

**Raz**: 自从智能合约以来，发生的第一件真正有趣的事情是，你开始听到 **Binance Smart Chain** 的交易量超过 Ethereum，用户也超过 Ethereum。这很奇怪。还出现了许多其他项目，但没人真正使用它们。你能用它构建什么？你能构建利用这里的速度，然后将其带回这里的安全性吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Raz**: The first thing that happened that had been really interesting since smart contracts was you started to hear Binance Smart Chain, more volume than Ethereum, more users than Ethereum. It was very strange. Uh, there was a bunch of other things that had launched, but nobody really used them. What could you build with that? Can you build something that leverages the speed here and then brings it back to the security over here.

</details>

**Raz**: 我们开始构建这个。我们构建了一些玩具示例，然后才意识到，我们构建的一切都无法在两个网络之间发送消息。你无法在 Binance Smart Chain 和 Ethereum 之间进行通信。所以我们开始构建一种更好的桥梁形式。然后我们很快意识到，嘿，这真的是问题所在，就是连接这些东西。于是，**Layer Zero** 就这样诞生了。那是我们解决自己的问题。我们构建了示例。但我们之前所做的一切都将我们引向了那里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Raz**: We started to build this. We built some toy examples and then only then did we realize that everything we were building you couldn't send a message between the two networks. You couldn't go between Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum. And so we started to build kind of a better form of a bridge. And then we very quickly realized, hey, this is this is really the problem is connecting these things. And that became that became layer zero. That was us solving our own problem. It was us building examples. But all of this stuff that we had done prior brought us to that.

</details>

**Raz**: 你知道，曾经只是一个想法，如今已成为现实。我们正站在改变金融体系很大一部分的悬崖边上。11 月，我们处理了 380 亿美元的交易。380 亿美元是 **Western Union** 一个月的 5.5 倍。这真的难以置信，因为你可以真正改变这一切的运作方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Raz**: You know, what started as an idea now is a reality. And now we're sort of on the precipice of like really meaningfully changing a large part of the financial system. November we did $38 billion. $38 billion is 5.5 times what Western Union does in a month. And that is just like crazy to think about because you can really change how some of this works.

</details>

**Brian Pellegro**: 驱动我的是解决难题。我想解决一个能帮助人们的难题。这无关你赚多少钱，而是你能让他们的生活整体变得多好，丰富他人的生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Pellegro**: That's what drives me is solving hard problems. And I want to solve a hard problem that helps people. And it's not about how much money you make, but like how much better you can make their lives overall, enriching others lives.

</details>

**Raz**: 很容易忘记，我们成长在一个稳定富裕的国家。有很多地方没有任何金融基础设施。甚至银行和金融机构都不可信，对吧？他们会诈骗你。他们会收取高额费用。他们会倒闭。存在欺诈。早期，**Bitcoin** 引起我共鸣的是，没有人可以来随意没收你的钱。没有人可以来做这些事情。你拥有所有权和控制权。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Raz**: It's very easy to forget growing up in a country that was stable and wealthy. There's a lot of places that don't have any access to any sort of financial infrastructure. And even the banks and the financial institutions aren't trustworthy, right? They'll scam you. They'll charge egregious rates. They'll go under. There's fraud. Early on, what resonated about Bitcoin was that nobody could come and just seize your money. Nobody could come and do these things. You had ownership and control.

</details>

**Raz**: 我认为 **Tether** 是这方面的最佳范例，大多数公司都专注于特定地域。所以，你是 Stripe，你在美国，你服务那里的机构和开发者，然后你扩张。而 Tether 则说：“我们将为那些难以获得美元的地方提供美元。”比如埃及、尼日利亚、阿根廷，以及那些货币每年通胀数百个百分点的地方。机构不可信，央行也不可信。他们确实创造了可能是世界上最好的生意之一，对吧？数千亿美元的资产，是世界第 15 大主权债务持有者。这一切都只是因为让普通人能够获得美元。我认为这是我们将在很长一段时间内看到的，最强大的变革之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Raz**: I think Tether is the best possible example of this where most companies really try to focus on a certain geography. So, you're going to be Stripe and you're going to be in the United States and you're going to service institutions and developers there and then you're going to expand and you're going to expand. and Tether went and they said, "We're going to offer access to the US dollar to all the places that don't have easy access." So, Egypt and Nigeria and Argentina and places where their currency is inflating at hundreds of percent a year. The institutions aren't trusted and the central banks aren't trusted and they really made arguably one of the best businesses in the entire world out of that, right? Hundreds of billions of dollars of assets, 15th largest holder of sovereign debt in the world. And all of that was just by giving the average person just access to the dollar. And I think that is uh as powerful a change as the world is going to see in a really long time.

</details>

**Raz**: 很久以前，互联网还不是互联网。它只是计算机的集合。斯坦福有一个群体，DARPA 也有一个群体。它们各自运行在自己的集群中，但无法相互通信。所以，如果我有一些数据或什么东西，我必须把我的数据磁盘带到斯坦福，插进去，在他们的程序上运行，然后带着结果飞回来。然后我们发明了互联网。互联网为我们提供了所有这些事物之间的连接，全球连接。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Raz**: A long time ago, the internet wasn't the internet. It was just groups of computers. And you would have a group at Stanford and a group at DARPA. And they each ran in their own cluster, but I couldn't talk to each other. And so if I had some data or something, I would have to take my disk of data, fly to Stanford, plug it in, run it on their program, and then I would fly back with the results. And then we invented the internet. And the internet gave us connectivity between all of these things, global connectivity.

</details>

**Raz**: 如果你回到区块链的早期，当时存在的东西，就像那样。你有 Ethereum，你有 Solana，你有不同的环境。它们都无法相互通信。没有办法把你的钱从这里转移到那里。没有办法在应用程序之间进行通信。所以，所有这些层（layers）所做的，就像互联网一样。它只是连接了这些环境。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Raz**: If you go back to the beginning of blockchains, what existed, it was exactly like that. You have Ethereum, you have Salana, you have different environments. None of them could talk to each other. There was no way to take your money from here to there. There's no way to communicate between an application. So all that layers did was exactly like the internet. It just connected these environment.

</details>

**Raz**: 早期，这些概念是陌生而奇异的。这感觉就像是幻想之地般的疯狂。但现在 15 年过去了，世界上每一个主要机构都在研究如何利用它。并且有越来越多的信念。Larry Fink 在世界经济论坛达沃斯论坛上说，普通人不再信任机构了。那么，一个没有信任现有机构的世界会是什么样子？它看起来是一个你无需信任的世界，并且再次向任何人开放。所以这对我们来说极其重要，而且我认为这是这个领域内唯一真正有价值的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Raz**: Strange and foreign concepts early on. This was, you know, felt like fantasy land craziness. But now 15 years later, every major institution in the world is figuring out how do we actually leverage this? And there's more and more conviction. And Larry Frink just stood up at the World Economic Forum in Davos and said institutions are not trusted anymore by the average person. And so like what does a world look like where there is not trust in the existing institutions? What it looks like is a world where you don't have to trust and again is open to anybody. And so that's incredibly important for us and again I think the only true thing of value within the space.

### 区块链三难困境与 LayerZero 的解决方案

**Raz**: 这本质上是一系列权衡和创伤。你可以选择其中两个权衡，但会失去一个。你生活在这个三角形的某个地方。每个区块链都必须这样做。它们都在一个网络中，并且它们都在相互通信。什么是区块？它是一系列交易。比如，我要从自己那里转钱给我的朋友 Bill，Bill 的朋友转钱给别人，或者执行这个交易。它们是一系列交易。网络中的每个验证者或参与者都下载并执行了。所以他们运行了它，并就结果达成一致，然后相互达成共识。他们只需要说，我们都同意这个。这就是新的区块。我们都同意这件事。现在，由于每个人都在轮流做这件事，他们都需要拥有相同的硬件。你知道，区块越大，他们需要的管道就越多，网络通信就越多。

<details>

**Raz**: There's it's essentially a series of trade-offs and a trauma. You can choose two of the trade-offs but you lose one of them. You live somewhere in this triangle. Every blockchain has to do the same thing. They're all in a network and they're all communicating with each other. And what is a block? It's a series of transactions like so I'm going to transfer money to from from myself to my friend Bill and Bill's friend transferring money to somebody else or performing this transaction. And they're a series of transactions. Every single validator or participant in the network has downloaded executed. So they ran it and agreed on the outcome and then come to consensus with each other. And all they need to say we all agree on this. This is the new block. We all agreed to this thing. Now, since everybody's taking turns doing this, they all need to have the same hardware. You know, the bigger the block, the more pipe they need, more network communication.

**Raz**: 所以，三难困境（trilemma）实际上归结为更高的 TPS（每秒交易数）。我希望我的区块链越快，设备就越大。设备越大，能运行它的人就越少，因为它更昂贵，可访问性更低。所以，如果你希望第三世界国家的人也能参与并帮助去中心化网络，嗯，他们做不到，如果这是一个，你知道，每月 4 万美元的服务器，你必须通过 AWS 付费。这就是为什么 Ethereum 选择，嘿，我们想要最大化的去中心化。所以，他们放弃了性能。Solana 想要更高的性能。所以，他们放弃了最大化的去中心化。参与的要求是，你需要质押很多。你需要拥有一台大型、强大的机器。这消除了最大化去中心化的能力。而且，你越追求高性能，它就越不分散。但没有人能同时获得两全其美。你如何拥有一个真正快速、高性能的东西，并且你可以在上面构建真正的互联网和应用程序，构建所有金融轨道，比如纽约证券交易所，每秒 200 万笔交易？你甚至在 Solana 上也永远达不到这个水平。你如何实现这一点，同时仍然保持去中心化？嗯，这是圣杯，不可能的事，一个不可能的问题。我最喜欢的那种。

**Raz**: And so, the trilmma really boils down to higher TPS, the faster I want my blockchain to be, the bigger the device. And the bigger the device means the less people who could run it cuz it's more expensive. It's less accessible. So, if you want somebody in a third world country participating and helping decentralize the network, um they can't if it's a, you know, $40,000 a month server that you have to pay through AWS, uh that's why Ethereum has chosen, hey, we want maximum decentralization. And so, they're giving up on performance. Solana wants higher performance. So, they're giving up on maximum decentralization. And this the the requirements to participate is you need to stake a lot. You need to have a big beefy machine. It eliminates that that uh ability to have that maximum decentralization. and and the more performant you go, the less decentralized it becomes. But nobody could get the best of both worlds. How do you have something that's really fast and high performant and you could build like the actual internet and like applications on internet on and like all financial rails like uh New York Stock Exchange, 2 million TPS, you're never going to get that even on a Salana. How do you achieve that and still be decentralized? Uh it's the holy grail, the impossible thing, an impossible problem. My favorite.

**Raz**: 我们需要的是一个火花。我们的狂野西部充满了关于自由、鬼魂、财富和可能性的故事。请设想一下，也许那些故事终于会成真。如果不可避免的时刻终于到来呢？建设完成，轨道铺就。如果你亲眼所见，你会怎么做？Ethereum 的扩展速度不够快。他们说：“这些 Layer 2（二层网络），它们继承了我们的安全性。去那里构建吧。这就是我们扩展的方式。”当他们这么说时，我称之为善意的谎言。一个善意的谎言，意思是你知道，你知道，我们关心这些原则。我们还不能扩展，所以我们需要对你撒谎，让你留下来。然后我们希望能找到一种方法在未来进行扩展。那个谎言触动了我，让我觉得没有人会去做这件事了。这一切都将付诸东流。这个实验将会失败。我们只会拥有一个更冗余的金融系统，而不是一个更自由的系统。但感觉就像最后的武士放下剑说：“这场斗争结束了。”我觉得我必须挺身而出。我觉得我必须这样做，因为我认为没有人会。

**Raz**: What we needed was a spark. Our Wild West is full of stories of freedom, of ghosts, of riches, of possibility. Consider for a moment that maybe at last those stories might be true. What if the inevitable was finally here? The building done, the rails laid. What would you do if you saw it with your own eyes? Ethereum couldn't scale fast enough. And they said, "These layer twos, they inherit our security. go build there. That's how we scale. When they said that, I call that a noble lie. A noble lie saying that you know, you know, we care about these principles. We can't scale yet, so we need to lie to you, so you stay. And then we'll hopefully find a way to scale in the future. That lie struck a nerve with me and made me feel like no one is left to do this thing. It'll all for nothing. This experiment will die. We'll just have a more redundant financial system, but not a freer one. But it felt like the last samurai putting their sword down and saying, "This cause is over." I felt like I had to pick it up. I felt like I had to do it because I thought no one else would.

### 核心原则：信念与影响力

**Brian Pellegro**: 我不在乎构建一个早期能赚很多钱但最终无人使用的技术。我们想构建一种被普遍使用的技术，一种无处不在的技术，一种被普遍采用的技术。所以这确实是一个能否获胜的问题。我最喜欢的例子是 **Demis**（Demis Hassabis），来自 **DeepMind**，他是我一直以来的个人英雄。他 20 年来从未改变过他的故事。行业在 2014 年爆发，然后又沉寂，然后又回来了，而他一直都非常诚实地说明什么有用，什么没用。我们专注于蛋白质折叠和解决实际问题，他从未动摇，并且一直处于该领域的顶端。我觉得这样的人就是鼓舞人心的。10 分里有 10 分，你每次都想押注他们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Pellegro**: I don't care to build a technology that makes a bunch of money early on but then never gets used. Like we want to build a technology that is used everywhere that is a bit ubiquitous that is adopted universally. So it's really a question of can we win. My favorite example of this is like Demis from Deep Mind is like my all-time just personal hero of like even from like he's never changed his story in like 20 years and the industry like blew up in 2014 and then it died and then it came back and he's like the whole time been like pretty intellectually honest of like here is what is useful, here is what is not. Like we're really focused on like protein folding and like solving real problems and he's just never wavered and he stayed at the very top of the field throughout the entire time. And I just think that kind of person is just like inspirational. Like 10 out of 10, you want to bet on them every single time.

**Brian Pellegro**: 即使在内部，也有很多时候，很容易说，“让我们妥协我们的原则来获胜吧。”就这次，稍微绕点弯路。我们一直在接受考验，关于我们如何构建或我们做出的决定。加拿大无疑向我们展示了这一点，在这个我居住的国家。如果你向卡车司机抗议活动捐款，你应该对他们查封你的银行账户、关闭你辛苦赚来的钱感到愤怒。我不需要更多的钱。我想要影响力。我想要一个特定的世界结果。忘掉任何短期的事情。五年后，十年后，世界会是什么样子？世界是如何变化的？我们如何构建系统，使其在未来仍然有用？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Pellegro**: There's been so many times even internally where it's so easy to say, "Let's let's compromise our principles so we win." This corner a little bit, just this one time. We get tested all the time on how we build or decisions we make. Canada certainly showed that to us here in this country that I live in. When if you donated to the trucker cause, you should be outraged at the fact that donating to a cause that they didn't like, they seized your bank accounts and turned off money you worked for, you earned.

</details>

**Brian Pellegro**: 我不需要更多的钱。我想要影响力。我想要一个特定的世界结果。忘掉任何短期的事情。五年后，十年后，世界会是什么样子？世界是如何变化的？我们如何构建系统，使其在未来仍然有用？很高兴我能，你知道，现在可以从 Uniswap 将资金从这里转移到两个区块链之间的某个地方。那么，当全世界的每家银行都有一个账本时，当全世界的资产都在链上运行时，当稳定币成为这些事情的主要方式时，当全球市场出现时，那会是什么样子？它实际上看起来是什么样的？其他人是怎么做的？很好，我们可以让它变得更好一点。重置一切，从第一性原理出发思考。我该如何打破它？我该如何打破它？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Pellegro**: I don't need more money. I don't I want impact. I want to I want a certain outcome for the world. Forget anything in the short term. What does the world look like 5 years from now, 10 years from now? How is the world changing? and how do we build the systems such that they are still useful then it's great that I can you know send money from unis swap here to something you know across the two blockchains now what does it look like when the entire when every bank in the world has a ledger when all of the world's assets move on chain when stable coins are like the dominant way that these things happen when global markets emerge right uh what does that actually look like how does everyone else do it great we can make it a little bit better it's reset everything think completely from first principles. How can I break it? How can I break it?

**Brian Pellegro**: 那种架构解锁了一个新的互联网。它将带来更多的自由。所以 **Web3** 对我来说是真实的。

**Brian Pellegro**: 建立一家公司极其困难。我们有六次不同的机会可以放弃。我们可以关闭公司。有很多次我们几乎没能成功。你只有在真正、真正相信你所做的事情时，才能坚持下去，没有信念，你就会一事无成。所以，我认为你最好找到你真正深信不疑的东西，然后去追求它，即使其他行业在当时更令人兴奋。我认为那是获得真正成功的唯一途径。人们会被热情所吸引。所以，我喜欢信念的一个方面是，拥有信念，自然而然地，你会对你所做的事情充满热情，因为你知道你不会质疑，你不需要别人的认可。你知道你相信某件事是正确的，应该存在于世上，是解决问题的正确方式。我认为人们会被这一点吸引。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Pellegro**: It is so hard to build a company. There was like six different times we could have just like walked away. We could have killed the company. there were so many times that you know we we almost didn't make it. You only really do that and you only really keep doing it if you really really believe in the thing that you're doing without conviction. You will just in any industry you will just never get there. And so I think you're way better off finding something you really deeply believe in and going for that even if other industries are more exciting at the time or whatever. I think that's the only way you get like true success in anything. People are really drawn to passion. And so one of the things I love about conviction, having conviction, is naturally you're you're more passionate about the thing that you're doing because you know you're not questioning, you don't need approval from anybody else. You know that you believe that a thing is right, should exist in the world, like is the right way to solve the problem. And I think people are drawn to that.

**Brian Pellegro**: 我认为拥有一些有趣的东西是好的。我认为 Toby（Toby Lütke）来自 Shopify，他谈论过雇佣“尖峰人才”。你并不真正想要一个完美均衡的通才。你真正想要的是一个拥有非凡特长的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Pellegro**: I think it's good to have something that's interesting and you're I think Toby from Shopify talks about them hiring for spikes. You don't really want a perfectly well-rounded generalist. What you really want is somebody with with crazy spikes.

**Brian Pellegro**: 我们是历史上第一家同时获得 Andre Horwitz 和 Sequoia 领投的公司。这非常罕见，而且我们几乎是我们能成为的 A6Z 和 Sequoia 投资的创始人中最不典型的一类。他们通常是斯坦福毕业生，拥有博士学位，曾在实验室工作，曾在某大公司工作。而我们去了新罕布什尔大学，辍学了。但这确实是那种“尖峰特质”。我认为我们完全确信我们所做的事情，我们不需要他们写支票。他们想参与是因为他们看到了我们朝着一个方向前进，所以我们肯定会建成这个东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Pellegro**: We were the first company ever in history to have both Andre Horwitz and Sequoia both co-lead out and like that is very rare and we're about as atypical as you could possibly get from like A6Z and Sequoia backed founders right they're normally Stanford grads who did a PhD who worked in a lab who worked at this big company and we're like went to the University of H New Hampshire like dropped out of school uh but it really was that like spikiness I think we were completely convinced of the thing that we were doing we didn't we didn't hair like we didn't need them to write a check. They wanted to be involved cuz they saw that we were like driven in a direction and so we were we were definitely going to build the thing.

**Brian Pellegro**: 我想告诉大家的是，这个领域的整个意义，这一切加密货币的整个前提是，你不应该必须“信任但要核实”，对吧？你不应该必须相信我所说的。你不应该必须相信我们。你将能够信任代码。你将能够自行观察它。2 月 10 日，我们将在舞台上，我们将实时证明 Ethereum 的历史，以每秒一百万次交易的速度进行验证，并提供 110 比特的安全性，对吧？没有人能做到哪怕是接近的水平。然后从现在到九月，我们每一步都会展示，你将能够触摸和感受它。我希望人们去这样做，因为那是让人产生信念的方式。我告诉你某事，你不会有信念。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Pellegro**: I think what I would say to people is like the whole point of the space like the whole premise of everything crypto is that you shouldn't have to right trust but verify right? You shouldn't have to trust me in what I say. You shouldn't have to trust us. You're going to be able to trust the code. You're going to be able to observe it for itself. On February 10th, we're going to stand on stage. We're going to prove Ethereum's history real time verifying at a million transactions per second at 110 bits of security, right? Nobody has ever done even remotely close to that. And then every step of the way from now until September, we will show and like you will be able to touch and feel it. I want people to go and do that cuz that's how you get somebody to have conviction. Me telling you something, you're not going to have conviction.

</details>

**Raz**: 这在技术上可能吗？嗯，或者你可能会得到一些人说：“嗯，我有一些想法。它们没那么聪明。”嗯，我认为是的。你还没有做任何事，对吧？光说不练。所以，我们要出去做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Raz**: Is it technically possible? Uh or so you might also get people saying, "Well, I had some of these ideas. They're not that smart." Well, I think so. What? You haven't done anything yet, right? Talk is cheap. So, we're going to go out there and do it.

### 联合创始人的羁绊与创业的意义

**Raz**: 建立一家公司是极其困难的。它大部分时间是一项吃力不讨好、痛苦的工作。没有你，我永远不可能做到。毫无疑问。我脑子里没有任何疑问。特别是你。没有你，我永远不可能独自做到。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Raz**: Building a company is unbelievably hard. It's a thankless, miserable job most of the time. I could have never ever done it without Raz. Like, no, with no question. There is zero doubt in my mind. Specifically, I mean, specifically him. There is just no way I ever could have done it alone. I would never.

**Raz**: 人们谈论联合创始人有多难，他们谈论自己永远不可能有联合创始人。我永远、永远、永远不可能独自做到。毫无疑问。

**Raz**: 同样，这感觉就像是命运。就像发生的一切，感觉像是命中注定。就像是预先注定的。我知道这听起来很疯狂，可能有点肉麻，但确实如此。对我们来说，合适的人在合适的时间出现。这可能只是我们把自己置于那些会发生的位置。我想起第一次见到你，相当频繁。这就像一部分，就像是命中注定，Brian 就是要翻过篱笆说：“嘿，我是 Brian。”对吧？我无法和别人一起做到这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Raz**: Likewise, it's destiny is what it feels like. Like almost like everything that's happened, it feels like it was meant to happen. Like it was pre-ordained. I know it sounds crazy and like probably cringy, but it does. Like the right people show up at the right time for us. And it's probably just a matter of us putting ourselves in those positions where that happens. Uh, I think about the first time I met you fairly regularly. Like it is a part like it is like a that was meant Brian was meant to pop over the fence and say, "Hey, I'm Brian." Right. And like I couldn't could not do this with anybody else.

</details>

**Brian Pellegro**: 从未听过这些事。这很感人。你知道，嗯。

**Brian Pellegro**: This is the best time of your life. You are healthy. You get to work with your best friends and you get to work on something cool. whether or not we had succeeded with layer zero, like before layer zero, we were not succeeding financially, but I was happy. I didn't quite get that until like um a couple years ago when my wife kept asking me like, "When does this end? What is your goal?" And I and I and and I was I kept ask what is my goal? It's the doing the thing.

### 改变世界的动力：信念、热情与坚持

**Brian Pellegro**: 我只能让人们记住一件事。要想真正改变事物，要想建立伟大的事业，你必须拥有信念。就是那种不屈不挠的信念和热情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Pellegro**: There's only one thing I can have people remember. In order to truly change things in order to build something great, you must have conviction. Like it is that the undying conviction and passion.

</details>

**Brian Pellegro**: 现在我开车去上班，我听很多传记。我正在听埃隆（Elon Musk）的传记，其中一件事引起了我很大的共鸣，就是他说的，很容易认为技术是自动进步的，对吧？埃及人有金字塔，然后技术就失传了。罗马人有输水管道，所有这些东西在黑暗时代都失传了。技术并非必然向前发展。世界并非如此，即使在过去一百年里它一直在朝着一个美好的方向发展，但它并不保证会向前发展，甚至不会朝着积极的方向发展。技术进步和世界变化是因为一群人，他们非常、非常热情，并非常、非常努力地工作来实现这一目标。这种信念、这种热情、这种辛勤工作不应被视为理所当然。它并非理所当然，而且很酷，它值得任何试图做这些事情的人获得最高的尊重。但这是必须付出的代价。我认为人们应该意识到这就是它所需要的，并决定他们想要去做这件事，并且关心某件事，就像再次一样，它是最好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Brian Pellegro**: Now as I drive into work, I listen to a lot of biographies. I'm listening to Elon's biography and one thing that resonated a lot with that is uh he says like it's very easy to think that technology just progresses automatically, right? Egyptians had the pyramids and then technology was lost. the Romans and the aqueducts and all this stuff lost in the dark ages like technology is not guaranteed to move forward. The world is not even though it's been moving forward in a wonderful state over the last hundred years not guaranteed to move forward or even move in a positive direction like technology advances and the world changes because a group of people are like really really passionate and work really really hard to make that thing happen. That conviction, that passion, that hard work should not be taken for granted. it's not expected and like it's cool and it deserves the utmost respect for anybody who's like trying to do those things but it is a prerequisite to do and I think people should realize that that is what it takes and and decide that they want to do that thing and caring about something is like again it is uh it's the best.
