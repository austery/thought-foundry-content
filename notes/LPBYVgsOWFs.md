### Robinhood Q3 财报概览与初步反应

Amit: 好的，大家好，欢迎回到新一期的 Tech Bros 节目。我们正在直播，有很多内容要聊。上周 Robinhood 刚刚发布了财报，那份财报相当引人注目，随着我们深入研究这些数据，会发现有很多值得分析的地方。我们也会聊一些 AI 相关的话题，看看英伟达的最新动态。但很高兴能再次和大家在一起。Tanner Roy，你怎么样？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of Tech Bros. We are live. We got a lot to talk about. We just had Robin Hood earnings last week and uh it was quite the earnings and it's going to give us a lot to kind of analyze as we get through the numbers. We'll also talk some AI stuff, what's going on with Nvidia. But excited to be here again. Tanner Roy, how you doing?</p>
</details>

Tanner: 好极了，兄弟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Great, brother.</p>
</details>

Amit: 太棒了。好吧，我想我们别浪费时间了，直接进入 Hood 的财报讨论吧。我们有很多要深入探讨的。我已经打开了演示文稿。在我们深入研究具体数字之前，很明显，Hood 在营收和利润上都取得了胜利。12.7 亿美元的营收，大幅超出了本已很高的预期。他们的**EPS**（Earnings Per Share: 每股收益，指公司每一股普通股所能获得的税后利润）也超出了预期约 5%。Roy，我先问你，当你看到那些数字时，你最直接的反应是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Doing awesome. Okay, I mean I think let's not waste any time. Let's just get right into Hood earnings. We got a lot to dive into. Got the presentation up before we get into the nitty-gritty numbers. Obviously, Hood did beat on the top of the bottom 1.27 billion. Big beat uh on revenue against the already elevated expectction expectations EPS. They beat by about 5%. Royal, I'll give it to you first. What was your raw reaction when you saw those numbers?</p>
</details>

Roy: 嗯，持续的惊喜。说实话，我们进去的时候已经知道了大部分数字。尽管如此，我们还是抱着很高的期望进去的，而且我们通常都低估了他们，结果证明是错的。他们一次又一次地以极高的水平执行。有些数字简直令人震惊。我不会深入细节，但那是一份非常亮眼的报告，尽管我们几乎了解其中的一切。当然，他们还预告了十月份的数据，虽然是初步的，但看起来绝对是惊人的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Um constant amazement. uh honestly like we go in knowing most of the numbers. Uh we go in having high expectations despite that and we go in usually being wrong on the low side and time and time again they just execute at an incredibly high level. Uh some of the numbers are just shocking. Like I won't get into the nitty-gritty but that was a very impressive report. uh despite us knowing almost everything about it. And of course they tease October numbers which were uh preliminary but look absolutely ridiculous.</p>
</details>

Amit: Tanner，你的看法呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Tanner, your thoughts?</p>
</details>

Tanner: 想法类似。我的意思是，这是一家如此不可思议的企业。老实说，我觉得这次的财报和 Palantir 的很像，期望值已经设得很高了，但他们每次还是能超越期望。如果你要投资一家未来十年的企业，现在为这种卓越的文化和未来的增长支付溢价是很难避免的。所以，对于长期投资者来说，Hood 正在确保人们明白，他们是未来的首选公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Same sort of thoughts. I mean this is such an incredible business. I I think honestly I think of it this earnings similarly to Palunteers where expectations were set high but somehow they still come above expectations every time. Um, and if you're betting on a 10-year business, it's hard to not pay the premium now for the exceptional culture and growth going forward. So, for the long-term investors, Hood is really making sure people understand that they are the uh, you know, the company of choice going forward.</p>
</details>

### 万亿市值之路与“世代”级公司潜力

Amit: 是的，我同意。而且，我们之前还在猜他们能不能达到 12.2 亿美元，结果他们竟然超过了这个数字，这简直太了不起了。然后他们在 EPS 上也超预期，还回购了股票。我的意思是，有很多事情可以谈，但总的来说，至少对我而言，更大的启示是，我觉得万亿市值是会发生的。我不知道什么时候，也不知道怎么发生。我知道摩根大通的预测只有 8000 亿，但我确实认为，随着他们进军不同的垂直领域，并给他们足够的时间让这个投资论点得以实现，他们将在 12 月份举办另一场关于 AI 的活动。他们的产品理念正在达到一个境界，是的，未来会有熊市，是的，Hood 在那段时间可能会受苦。但我认为他们正在建立一个能够抵御任何宏观环境的企业，这也是它如此令人兴奋的原因。这也是为什么那些试图做空它的人，不断得出这样的结论：等等，也许 Hood 正在成为一个世代性的投资标的，而不仅仅是一个周期性的。因此，我认为总有一天，它的市值可能会接近一万亿美元，但时间会证明一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I agree. And, um, I mean, we were trying to figure out could they get to 1.2 two billion and they somehow beat that which was just remarkable. And then they beat on EPS, they bought back their stock. I mean, there's a lot of things to get into, but overall I I think the the larger takeaway to me at least. Um I don't know, not everyone sees this, but does feel like a trillion's going to happen. I don't know when. I don't know how. I know JP Morgan's only at 800 billion, but I do think as they attack different verticals and you give them enough time to let the thesis play out, they're having another event in December around AI. like the product philosophy is getting to a point where yes, there will be bare markets. Yes, Hood will probably suffer during that time. But I think they're building the business to be able to withstand any macro, which is why it's also very exciting. It's why people that are trying to short it, you know, keep coming to these conclusions that like, wait a second, maybe Hood is is becoming more of a generational play, not just a cyclical play. And as a result, I think that one day is, you know, probably going to be closer to a trillion, but time will tell.</p>
</details>

Roy: 是的。我的意思是，这是一家 Tanner 提到的，你知道，长期来看是世代性的投资。你也提到了万亿美元。自从大多数**Fintech**（Financial Technology: 金融科技，指利用科技手段革新传统金融行业的新兴业态）公司公布财报以来，我看到今天有一个关于我拥有的三家金融科技公司（包括 Robinhood）和另一家我没有的公司的投票，都是好公司，问题是你会赌哪一家。有些人从估值的角度争论，短期内这可能说得通，但长期来看，要赌那些世代性的公司。而这正是一家世代性的公司。我的意思是，如果有人对此表示怀疑，别看股价。我不是说股价总是最好的评判标准，虽然在这种情况下它确实与基本面相符。但看看他们在过去两年里推出了什么，以及他们发展了多少。这简直令人印象深刻到疯狂。然后再去看看他们的开支。这简直令人震惊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. I mean like this is one you know Tanner mentioned it you know uh generational betting over the long term you you mentioned one trillion as well you know I' I've seen since most of the the um fintech companies reported earnings there was a pull out that was today between three fints that I own including Robin Hood and one other that I don't all good companies is like which one would you bet on for here some people were making the argument from valuations like shortterm that that can make sense longterm bet on the generational companies And this is a generational company that just I mean if somebody doubts that don't look at the share price. I'm not saying you know that's not always the best judge although in this case it does match up. But look at what they've rolled out and how much they've evolved over the last two years. It is insane impressive. And then go look at their expenses. That's like it's just shocking. Uh</p>
</details>

### 收购策略与未来增长点

Tanner: 我能问你们一个问题吗？现金储备在多个季度以来首次实现了季度环比增长。我不知道具体数额。嗯，至少在过去的八九个季度里，现金都是在减少的。你们认为他们很快会进行另一次收购吗？他们确实说过会持续在有机增长、**M&A**（Mergers and Acquisitions: 并购，指公司间的合并与收购行为）和股东回报上进行投入。你们认为下一次并购或收购会是什么领域？他们会把目标对准什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> yeah it can I pose you guys a question? Um cash just went up quarter over quarter for the first time in uh many quarters. I don't know the amount. Um you know at least eight or nine quarters it's gone down. Do you guys think that they are going to make another acquisition here soon? They do say that they're going to continuously uh spend on organic growth M&A and shareholder returns. um what do you think that next M&A or or uh acquisition is going to be in like what what are they going to target for that next acquisition?</p>
</details>

Amit: 这是个好问题。你有什么猜测吗？我没有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> It's a good question. Do you have a guess? I don't.</p>
</details>

Roy: 呃，老兄，他们总是出人意料。我的意思是，我们真的想到他们会收购 Bitstamp 吗？然后，我不知道，另一个是什么来着？那个我忘了名字的 AI 公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Uh dude, they surp I mean did we really think they were going to get Bitstamp and then like I don't know. Uh what was the other one? um the AI name that I'm foretting</p>
</details>

Amit: Wonderfy。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Wonderfy.</p>
</details>

Roy: 哦，Wonderfy。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Oh, wonderfy.</p>
</details>

Amit: Pluto。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Pluto.</p>
</details>

Roy: 是的，我不知道。他们总能找到不同的垂直领域进入。我认为下一次收购我希望看到的是一个全新的垂直领域，一个能让他们拓展新业务线的领域。我不认为他们需要收购一个预测市场公司，因为他们已经自己建立了一个。但我真的不知道。是的，不过这是个好问题，Tanner，因为他们确实有很多现金，即使他们每季度再回购 1 亿美元的股票，也还会有足够的现金去做些什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Like I don't know. They find different verticals to get into. I I think the next acquisition I would like to see is obviously a new vertical and it's a vertical that would allow them to expand a new line of business. I I don't think they have to, you know, acquire a prediction markets because they already built one. But I have no idea. Yeah, it's a good question though, Tanner, because there is a lot of cash and you know, even if they buy back another 100 million of stock every quarter, there's going to be more than enough cash to do something with.</p>
</details>

Amit: 是的，我的猜测是，你可能有更好的想法，我认为他们会进行收购。这一直是他们战略的一部分。他们非常清楚自己能构建什么。我的意思是，他们几乎可以构建任何东西，但什么是更有创意的方式，是直接出去收购还是与某人合作？他们也能非常迅速地整合这些收购。但是，会不会是国际业务方面的？国际业务是下一个问号。这次在财报数据细分中，他们确实提到了一些国际业务的推出，但这确实是市场明年需要看到的。所以这说得通。我知道他们有 Wonderfy，但也许是在欧洲或英国，或者可能是新加坡，帮助他们在那里获得更多牵引力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, my my guess and you you probably have something better is uh I think they will do acquisitions. It's it's always been part of their strategy. They have a very good understanding of exactly what they they can build. I mean, they can build pretty much anything, but what is a lot more creative to just go out and buy it or partner with somebody? So and they assimilate those really rapidly too. But um is something international uh international is you know that next question mark. Uh you know they did roll out and mentioned some more international in the breakout uh of the numbers this time but it's uh that's really I think what the market needs to see next year. So it makes sense. I know I know they have wonderfy uh but yeah maybe something in Europe or the UK um or possibly in Singapore that helps them you know even gain more traction there.</p>
</details>

Tanner: 是的，在他们收购 Wonderfy 之前，我不会想到他们会做那样的事情。通过那次收购，他们已经在加密货币领域取得了一些不错的进展，但这实际上让他们获得了加拿大的某些许可证。所以，老实说，你说的很可能是最可能的结果，即某种为了获得许可证的国际扩张行动，通过购买来获得监管批准。但我确实认为他们最终会进行一次预测市场的并购。他们会在预测市场领域进行一次收购，因为他们预测业务 50% 的成本都付给了另一个参与者。这看起来不像 Robinhood 的风格。他们通常不会为技术栈支付那么高的费用。他们通常会内部构建，并且我认为他们最终希望与 Kalshi 正面交锋并取胜。你不会看到他们为了加密货币业务与 Coinbase 合作，他们想自己做事，并提供最好的价格和技术。我不知道他们是否会永远成为 Kalshi 的合作伙伴。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I wouldn't have thought that they were going to do something like that until the acquisition of um Wonderfy, which they've already had some pretty good inroads with with crypto, but this actually put them in the certain licenses uh for Canada. So, honestly, what you said is probably the most likely outcome that it's some sort of international expansion play for licenses, just getting regulatory approval through purchase. But I do think they're going to make a uh prediction market uh M&A eventually. They're going to make an acquisition in prediction markets because 50% of their cost for predictions is going to to another player. That doesn't seem like Robin Hood. Like they just don't pay that high of fees for for a tech stack. They usually build it in house and they want to offer I think eventually they want to go headto-head with KHI and try to win. You don't see them partnering with Coinbase for crypto and like they want to do things themsel and and offer the best pricing and tech. I uh I don't know if they'll be a partner of call she's forever.</p>
</details>

Roy: 是的，而且以 Kalshi 的运营方式来看，你永远不知道。但我不知道他们是否想被收购，而且现在可能为时已晚。Polymarket 也是如此。我做过一个分析，大概是几个月前，关于预测市场，还有一些其他的参与者，但你可以看到主要是 Polymarket 和 Kalshi。Limitless 更偏向于短期交易，Myriad 看起来很有趣但规模很小。所以，我不知道，Robinhood 倾向于以一个相当合理的价格收购一些规模小得多的公司，然后他们会有效地将其规模化，这不是每家公司都能做到的。所以我们得看看会不会是这些公司中的一个。还有很多私营公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And it might be with the way that call she's running. You never know. But that I don't know that they want to be bought out and it might be too late at this point. Poly market likewise as well. I I did a breakdown. It's been a few maybe like two months but as far as predictions market there are some other players there but you can see it's mostly just poly market and cowshi limitless is more of short-term type of trading myriad looked interesting but it was really small and so I don't know it it tends to be that Robin Hood will buy out something that's much smaller um at at a pretty reasonable price and then they'll actually scale it effectively which not every company can do. So we'll have to see if it's one of these others. There's a lot of private ones as well.</p>
</details>

Amit: 是的，关于预测市场，我不知道你们有没有注意到，他们从未公开承认过 Kalshi。也就是说，当被问到时他们会谈论，但他们从未发布过帖子，也从未与他们进行过采访。Kalshi 在推特上@过他们，他们从未转发过。他们从未把与 Kalshi 合作这件事大肆宣传。我认为这正印证了你的观点，Tanner。我不知道他们是会尝试复制还是做自己的东西。如果我是 Kalshi 的创始人，我会在建立合作关系时设置一些严格的非竞争条款。但话又说回来，也许那家伙没有筹码，也许他只是想要分销渠道。但他们并没有对 Kalshi 表达太多友好的言辞，不是因为我认为他们不喜欢他们，而是我认为，正如你所说，他们可能最终会试图削弱他们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> The thing about prediction markets is, you know, I don't know if you guys have noticed this, but they've never acknowledged Khi publicly as in they've talked about them when asked, but they've never put out a post. They've never done an interview with them. Khi has tweeted at them. They've never like retweeted that. Like, they've never made it a big deal to tell people that they're working with Khi. And I I think that goes to your point, Tanner. I don't know if they're going to try to replicate or do their own thing. I don't, you know, if I was the call she founder, I would have set up some serious non-competes when we got into the partnership. But then again, maybe the guy didn't have leverage. Maybe he just wanted the distribution. But they haven't fully expressed a lot of amicable words with Koshi, not because I don't think they like them, but I think to your point, they they might be trying to undercut them eventually.</p>
</details>

### 深入解读财务数据

Amit: 好的，让我们深入一些数据。有很多幻灯片要看，但我想我们从这里开始。Roy，200 亿美元的净存款，有史以来最高的净存款率。你对这个平台的整体资产积累有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> okay so let's get into some deeper numbers. Uh there was a lot of slides to go through but I think we'll get started with this. Um Roy 20 billion in net deposits, highest net deposit rate ever. kind of your thoughts on the overall asset accumulation of the platform.</p>
</details>

Roy: 我的意思是，最酷的是，这不仅仅是托管资产在增长，托管资产本身已经相当可观，但与像嘉信理财（Charles Schwab）这样的公司相比仍然相形见绌。但看到资产实际增加，这真的非常非常令人印象深刻。我认为，当他们的银行完全推出后，很多人都能使用时，他们会重点关注的一个领域是争取人们的直接存款。现在这听起来可能有点负面，但我的意思是他们会激励这样做。他们会说，嘿，我们希望你来这里，这是随之而来的所有好处。是的，他们能获得的定期存款越多，平台就会随着时间的推移而增长，给予它稳定性，尤其是在经历周期性时期时会有所帮助。但确实，这真的非常不可思议，我没想到会有这么多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I mean the cool thing is this isn't just assets under custody that are growing which are substantial but are still dwarfed by you know somebody like a Charles Schwab. But like seeing the assets actually increase that's really really impressive. One of the things that I think that they'll target a lot of too when when the bank fully launches so a lot of people have access to it is going after people's direct deposit. Now that sounds negative but I mean they they will incentivize it. They'll be like hey we want you here. what here's all the benefits that comes from that and uh yeah the more deposits they can get on a regular basis I mean that just grows the platform over time gives it stability helps uh especially too when uh you do go through a cyclical time but yeah really really incredible um I didn't expect that much</p>
</details>

Tanner: 是的，我们之前讨论过这个，但我很好奇你的想法，Amit。因为我想我和 Roy 在某一页上讨论过这个。它谈到了他们拥有的 1 亿美元业务，Bitstamp 也列在上面，但 Bitstamp 这个季度给他们带来了 1600 万美元。那么，这如何增长到 1 亿美元？如果它现在对他们来说实际上是一个 6000 万美元的业务，他们为什么称之为 1 亿美元的业务？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> yeah we um we talked about this before but I'm curious uh your thoughts emit because I think me and Roy talked about this on page Uh, it talks about their Yeah, this one the hundred million businesses that they have and Bitstamp is listed on there, but Bitstamp made them $16 million this quarter. So, how does that ramp to a hundred million and how are they calling this $100 million business if it's essentially a $60 million business for them right now?</p>
</details>

Amit: 你为什么说它是 6000 万？因为他们这个季度赚了 1600 万美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Why are you saying it's 60 million? because they made $16 million this quarter.</p>
</details>

Tanner: 但他们是不是按过去 12 个月计算的，所以……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> But are they doing this on a trailing 12 months and that's why you know</p>
</details>

Amit: 是的，但他们是六月份才收购的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, but they only acquired it since June and and</p>
</details>

Tanner: 我的意思是，也许他们只是看 Bitstamp 的整体数据并计算在内，也许在第四季度有一些巨大的季度。我猜是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> like I mean maybe they're looking just in the numbers that Bitstamp did in general and counting that and maybe there were some huge quarters. I guess that happened in Q4 but um</p>
</details>

Amit: 嗯，我认为他们在这里把 Bitstamp 单独列出来的原因是，对他们来说，Bitstamp 将会重度依赖机构交易量，而这正是他们可以提供更多服务的地方。我记得 Vlad 在一次采访中谈到，他们为零售客户所做的一切，他们知道也可以提供给机构。机构一直在要求这些服务，但他们并没有真正专注于此，因为他们一直太专注于零售业务了。所以，也许 Bitstamp 是他们开始提供更多类似 Coinbase 机构服务的地方，不仅仅是交易量，还包括其他服务。这就是为什么他们会说这值得被单独列为一个年化收入 1 亿美元的业务，而不仅仅是加密业务的一部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> yeah. Well, I think I think the reason they're separating Bitstamp right here is because Bitstamp to them, I think, is going to be heavily rooted in institutional volumes and that is where they can offer a lot more services. I I think there was this interview of Vlad basically talking about everything they're doing for retail. They know they can offer it to institutions. The institutions have been asking for it, but they haven't really focused on it because they've been so focused on retail. So, maybe Bitstamp is where they start having more of a Coinbased institutional offering, not just for like trading volumes, but for other services. And that's why they're kind of saying that this deserves to be not just part of the crypto element of the business but rather you know a individualized 100 million annualized revenue business in and of itself.</p>
</details>

Roy: 是的，我的猜测是，因为它面向机构，他们可能知道一些关于未来几个季度的事情，我敢肯定他们知道，这会让他们超过那个门槛，而不是仅仅说“我们可能会加速到那个水平”。这通常不是 Robinhood 在这种图表中会表达的意思。所以他们知道有事情要发生了。Robinhood 的典型操作模式是以一个好价格收购，融入生态系统，然后进行规模化。他们一次又一次地这样做。他们也会对 Bitstamp 这样做，而且看起来他们已经开始了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. My my guess there was since it's institutional facing that they may know something about the next I mean I'm sure they do about the next couple of quarters it gets them over that uh to where they're not just saying well we might accelerate to that like that's not what this chart usually indicates for Robin Hood. So they they know something um is on the way and the typical modus operandi for Robin Hood is acquisition at a good value incorporate in the ecosystem and then you scale it and they've done that time and time again. They're going to do that with Bitstamp and it already looks like they are.</p>
</details>

Amit: 你提到的那次采访，我不确定是同一次还是另一次，Vlad 提到他预见到有一天 Robinhood 的一半收入将来自国际市场。那还需要一段时间。但我的意思是，他们现在根本没有国际收入。所以如果你相信他，这很容易估值和规划。看看他们的执行力，我不确定有谁会不信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> The other uh that you mentioned a bit on that interview, I'm not sure if it was the same interview or another one, Vlad mentioned that he foresaw a point where Robin Hood would actually have half of its revenue coming from international. That's that's a ways out. But I mean they have none right now. So that's pretty easy to value and chart like if you believe him. And looking at their execution, I'm not sure who doesn't.</p>
</details>

Roy: 他是什么时候说的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Who who when did he say this?</p>
</details>

Amit: 我想是在彭博社的采访。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I think it was Bloomberg. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
</details>

Roy: 哇哦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Wow. Wow.</p>
</details>

Amit: 那是总收入吗？比如会包括银行业务、信用卡和所有东西？就是说未来的收入要翻倍？我相信那是在银行推出之前说的。所以，我不知道。这是个好问题，得问 Vlad。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And is that total revenue like that would include banking and credit cards and everything like just double this revenue going forward? That was before the bank uh launched, I believe. So, I don't know. That's a good question for Vlad.</p>
</details>

Roy: 是的，那真的很酷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, that's really cool.</p>
</details>

Amit: 我会试着找找那个片段。但是，是的，如果机构业务和国际业务开始变得比美国的零售业务重要得多，我的意思是，那正是他们能够扩张的垂直领域所在。你们对这些交易量有什么看法？很明显，它们相当庞大。我认为 7.3 亿是他们有史以来最高的交易收入。期权、加密货币方面稍微有点疲软。股票是 8600 万，我认为这是他们多年来的最高水平。期权是 3.04 亿。我们喜欢这个数据吗？我们认为这是可持续的吗？我们是否认为更高净值的账户正在转移过来并进行更多交易？你们现在怎么看这些交易量？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I'm gonna see if I can find that clip as well. But, but yeah, I mean, look, if the institutional part of the business along with the international part of the business starts to become a much bigger issue than just retail in the States, I mean, that's where I think the verticals are really there for them to be able to expand. What what did you guys think of these transaction volumes? I mean, obviously they were pretty massive. 730 I think was the most they've ever done in transaction based revenues. Um options crypto was a little bit light. Equity was 86 million. I think that's the highest they've had in years. Options at 304. Like do we do we like it? Do we think it's sustainable? I mean do we think the higher net worth accounts are coming over and trading more or how are you guys thinking of all this volume right now?</p>
</details>

Roy: 我认为它会随着时间缓慢增长，但会非常不稳定。所以我们会看到很多像这样的季度，一个超级火热的牛市季度，然后是一些稍微平淡的季度，尤其是在加密货币方面。但随着时间的推移，更多的人交易，更多的托管资产，这是合理的。我认为净利息收入实际上比预期的更可持续，周期性更小，尽管有降息，有几个分析师也指出了这个方向。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I I think it'll grow slowly over time. U but it's going to be very lumpy and so we're going to see a lot of quarters like that where it's a super heated bull quarter and then some that where it's a little bit lighter especially in the crypto side too. Um but yeah over time I mean more people trading more assets under custody makes sense. Um the I think the net interest income is actually a lot more sustainable and less cyclical than expected despite the rate cuts which um there's a couple analysts that are pointing that direction too.</p>
</details>

Tanner: 你看嘉信理财，他们每个客户的平均资产大约是 35,000 美元，而 Hood 是 12,000 美元，而且他们的会员只比 Hood 多 1000 万。所以，我认为 datadriven investing 指出了这一点，他说为什么每个用户的管理资产增长速度比用户增长快得多，但我实际上认为未来会是这样。每个客户的资产增长空间比每个用户的增长空间要大得多。我刚意识到，每当你审视 Hood 时，尽管估值已经预期了大量的增长，但未来仍有如此多的增长空间。这甚至是在活跃交易者方面，他们的大部分收入来源。想象一下，如果他们开始争取真正的高频交易者和期权玩家，并真正试图去争取 Tasty Trade 的用户。那才是大量资金所在。而 Tasty Trade 仍在从 Hood 手中赢得用户，我只是不认为 Vlad 会继续容忍这种情况。很明显，我认为他们拥有一支 A+ 的工程团队，我认为他们会与他们在**金融科技**领域设定的任何对手竞争。

<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. You you look to Schwab their average assets per customer is like $35,000 versus Hood's 12,000 and they only have I think 10 million more members. So the room for um I think datadriven investing pointed this out to me where he said like you know why is per user uh assets under management growing so much faster than user but I actually think that's going to be the case going forward like there is just so much more room for assets per customer to grow than per user and um I'm just like realizing whenever you look at hood although the the the the valuation is kind of you know expecting a lot of that growth. There still is so much future growth to come and wait like like that's even on the active trader side like like where they make a lot of their money. Imagine if they start going after like really high frequency traders and and options players and really try to go after the the Tasty Trade users. That's where a lot of the money is going to be. and and Tasty Trade is still winning users away from Hood and I just don't think Vlad will continue to put up with that and clearly I think they have an A+ engineering team and I think they'll go up against any single person that they set their uh you know sort of focus on in fintech.</p>

### 卓越的运营杠杆与商业模式

Amit: 运营支出与他们的收入增长相比并不算太疯狂。GAAP 净收入，我的意思是，这简直太疯狂了，12.2 亿美元的收入，净利润 5.56 亿。Tanner，你能谈谈他们的运营杠杆吗？以及你认为未来一年会走向何方？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh opex not too crazy compared to their revenue growth gap net income I mean this is just crazy 556 million on 1.2 2 billion in revenue. The operating I I I guess Tanner, can you speak to a little bit of their operating leverage and where do you think that's going over the next year as well?</p>
</details>

Tanner: 嗯，我认为它只会上升。因为这里面没有什么是真正的一次性收益。随着他们继续扩大规模，你会看到税率随时间上升。但除此之外，这只是因为他们的技术栈不是建立在一堆向其他科技公司订阅服务的基础上，他们不用支付高昂的 SaaS 利润。他们是内部构建的，所以他们不必向其他技术提供商付费。事实上，他们可能最近才刚刚摆脱 Galileo。随着他们意识到支付正成为其业务的更大部分，他们可能会最终建立自己的支付处理器。所以，我不知道。他们拥有技术人才，这使他们能够内部构建。你会不断看到他们在利润率方面处于顶尖水平，这也使他们能够提供迄
今为止最好的定价，甚至没有人能与之竞争。顺便说一句，SoFi 今天刚宣布，他们的加密货币交易费将为 1%。所以他们一上来就比 Robinhood 贵。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, I don't think it's going anywhere but up. Uh because none of this is really uh one-time benefits. I mean, you're going to see the tax rate go up uh over time as they, you know, continue to scale. But aside from that, this is just because their tech stack is not based on a bunch of subscriptions from other tech companies that they're paying, you know, high SAS margins on. They built it in-house and so they don't have to pay other uh, you know, tech providers. In fact, they probably have just recently stepped away from Galileo. They're probably going to end up building their own payment processor as they realize that payments is becoming a larger part of their business. So, I don't know. They have the tech talent and that allows them to build in-house. You're going to constantly see them be at the top of the rung for margins and that's what allows them to have by far the best pricing and no one can even compete. By the way, SoFi, it just came out today that uh SoFi is going to have the uh um crypto trading uh fees at 1%. So they are coming out of the gate swinging more expensive than Robin Hood.</p>
</details>

Roy: 如果你在嘉信理财支付 12% 的保证金利息，而 Robinhood 只收你 5% 或 4.75%，老兄，我认为这就是为什么他们能从保证金中获得 1.53 亿美元的收入。他们上个季度好像是 1.14 亿。我的意思是，这太疯狂了。但就像更大的账户选择通过转向 Hood 来节省大量资金。我看到你调出了**Rule of 40**（Rule of 40: 一项衡量SaaS公司健康状况的指标，即增长率与利润率之和应超过40%）的图表，它持续向右上角攀升。这最初当然是 Palantir 的图表，我提一下是因为我知道你肯定知道它是什么，但有些人可能不知道。英伟达就在这里。Palantir 就在这里。我相信这是，嗯，我认为是排名前 40 的、权重超过一定数量的企业。我不记得具体是多少了，但 Palantir 的数据是荒谬的。Robinhood 大概是 131%。虽然不是最好的比较对象，但我的意思是，金融科技公司越来越追求 Rule of 40，而 Robinhood 在这方面占据主导地位。顺便说一下，那是 Joshua 的图表，他更新了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> If you're paying 12% of Schwab for margin and Robinet's giving it to you for five or 4.75, dude, I think that's why they're bring they did 153 million in revenue off margin. They did like 114 last quart. I mean, it's just crazy. But it's like bigger accounts are choosing to save a lot of money by going to Hood. I I saw that you pulled up the rule of 40 uh chart which continues to climb up to the right. This is originally of course Palanteer's graphic uh mentioning that because I know you wouldn't know what it is but some might not and Nvidia's right over here. Palanteer's right over here. I believe that this was uh of the um I think it's the top 40 businesses that are uh weighted over a certain amount. I don't remember what it is exactly, but Palanteer is ridiculous. Robin Hood like 131%. not like the best comp and everything, but I mean fintech is increasingly going after the rule of 40 and Robin Hood just dominates that. So that's uh Joshua's graphic by the way. He updated</p>
</details>

Tanner: 顺便说一句，当我说 Vlad 是个“变态”时，我用的是最友好的方式。我的意思是，我觉得他表现出很多杰夫·贝佐斯式的特质，他会用尽一切手段去战斗，以确保他拥有最好的产品。如果有任何公司想在定价上与 Hood 一对一比较，Hood 最终只会降低他们的价格。就像在存款方面，Hood 总是说他们想进入前 10%，哦对不起，是 SoFi 说他们想进入前 10% 或 15%。Hood 想进入前 1%。在他们所有的产品中，我感觉他们总是想成为前 1%，而 SoFi 总是想成为前 20%。通常情况下，如果你做 Robinhood 所做的事情，你不会有很好的利润率，但不知何故他们仍然做到了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> by the way I mean it in the nicest terms whenever I say that Vlad's a sicko. What I mean is like I feel like he he shows a lot of these Jeff Bezosesque qualities where he will just fight, you know, with everything he has to make sure that he has the best product. And if there's any company that wants to compare one to one on pricing versus Hood, Hood will end up just lowering their prices. Not so like like even in deposit, Hood always says they want to be in the top 10 or sorry, SoFi says they want to be in the top 10 15%. Hood wants to be in the top 1%. And in across all of their products, I just feel like they always want to be in the top 1% where SoFi always wants to be in the top 20%. And usually if you're doing what Robin Hood does, you don't get very good margins, but somehow they still are. Um,</p>

### Vlad Tenev 的愿景：从财报电话会到产品哲学

Amit: 是的，我正要播放这个片段。他正在追求一切。他正在追求一切。这是 Vlad 在 TBPN 上讨论他们未来方向的片段。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah, I was going to play this clip right here. I mean, he's going after everything. He is going after everything. Here was Vlad on TBPN discussing more about what direction they're going in when it comes to</p>
</details>

Vlad Tenev: 和很多人一样，我上 YouTube 看看，谁在谈论我们的财报。实际上有一群网红会直播看我们的财报并进行讨论。我亲身体验了一下，他们长时间地看着一张只有我们 logo 的幻灯片。那甚至不是我们新品牌的 logo，是旧的那个。然后就像，你知道，我们在一个电话会议系统上，分析师们在电话里，没人知道轮到谁说话。那是一次糟糕的体验。所以我们开始只是想把这个整理好。于是，三个季度前，我们做了第一次视频财报电话会，每个季度我们都在思考如何能做得更多一点。如果你从一个散户股东的角度来看，它不能仅仅是我们照本宣科地读信息，它必须是有吸引力的。所以，要有视频，要让更多的利益相关者能现场通过视频提出好问题，实时提问。你们在你们的论坛里已经搞明白了，我认为财报是一个社区活动，你应该这样看待它。我认为最好的 CEO，最好的公司，那些真正关心与散户互动的公司，必须从把它看作一项苦差事转变为把它看作是又一个可以向尽可能多的利益相关者和社区成员展示你的品牌和你所代表的价值观的活动。就像把它看作一个产品一样来思考。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> And you know, like many people, I go on YouTube and I see, let's see, who's talking about our earnings and there were actually groups of influencers that watch our earnings live and kind of talk about it. And I sat through the experience and they were looking at for a long time just a slide deck with our logo in there. It wasn't even the new brand of our logo. It was the old one and then it's just like you know we were on a polycom the analysts were on the call nobody knew whose turn it was to talk it was a bad experience and we started just by wanting to clean that up. So, we did our first video earnings call three quarters ago, and every quarter we've been thinking about how can we do a little bit more. And if if you view it from the perspective of a retail shareholder, it can't just be we're reading scripts of information. It has to be engaging. And so, it's video. It's getting more stakeholders that can ask good questions live on video if possible, asking those questions in real time. And you know, you guys have figured it out in your forum. I think that what earnings is is a community event and you should think about it as such. And I think the best CEOs, the best companies who really care about engaging retail have to move from thinking about it as a chore to actually one more event where you can get your brand and what you stand for out to as many of your stakeholders and community members as possible. like thinking about it like a thinking about it like a product.</p>
</details>

Amit: 我要播放的另一个片段是 Vlad Tenev 谈论人们能够投资几乎任何他们想要的东西的能力，我想这也把我们带入了**资产代币化**（Tokenization: 将现实世界资产的权利转换为区块链上的数字代币的过程）的讨论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, do you have that other clip of Vlad Tennov? Because I I don't think I've seen that other one that you were going to show. >> Yeah, this is him talking about uh the ability for people to invest in pretty much anything they want, which I guess gets us into the tokenization conversation as well.</p>
</details>

Vlad Tenev: 有一段时间，趋势确实是朝着指数化和 ETF 发展的，作为一种新产品，它们获得了认可，并开始吸引大量资产。当我们刚开始创办 Robinhood 时，我们正朝着一个不同的方向前进，一些投资者对此持怀疑态度，他们认为一切都将是指数化的、间接的，人们只会投资于广泛的市场指数和多元化基金。但我们赌了另一个方向，认为实际上人们想要摆脱指数，他们实际上想要更精确地表达自己的观点。所以你看到了更精细化的投资，个股，但不仅仅是个股，你还看到了期权交易、零日期权（当天到期）的兴起。我认为预测市场是这一趋势的延续，因为你开始看到关于股票以及它们是否会超出财报预期的市场。很多人过去常常通过交易股票或加密货币来参与总统选举并表达自己的观点，但现在你可以直接这样做了。所以我认为它正在变得更加精细化。人们会有他们理解并有信心的非常具体的论点，我们正在为他们提供表达这些论点的产品。在土地方面，那非常有趣，因为我会把它归类为另类投资。人们想要接触另类投资，现在接触另类投资的唯一方式是通过 REITs 或这些多元化指数。但人们真正想要的是能够像投资上市公司股票一样轻松地投资于一家私营公司，也许他们想要投资他们认为会表现良好社区的一块土地或一处房产，而不仅仅是某个在各地都有投资组合的商业房地产基金。因为他们能更好地理解那是否会升值或贬值。我认为我们正朝着这个方向发展。资产代币化正在解决很多技术问题，当然还有监管障碍，一旦我们克服了这些，我认为会为散户投资者打开许多另类资产的大门。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> You know, for a while the the trend was really toward indexing and ETFs as a as a new product got adoption. and they started getting tons of assets. When we were first starting Robin Hood, we were kind of moving in a different direction and there was some skepticism from investors who thought that everything was just going to be indexed and indirect and it would just be people investing in broad market indices and diversified funds and and we we made a bet in the other direction that in fact no uh people want to move away from indexes. They actually want to uh express their viewpoints more precisely. And so you're seeing more granular investments, individual equities, but not just individual equities, you're seeing options trading, the rise of zero day options, same day expiry. And I think prediction markets are a continuation of that because you're starting to see markets uh for stocks and whether they're going to outperform earnings, for example. Uh a lot of a lot of people used to play the presidential election and have a thesis there that they would play by trading stocks or crypto, but now you can do that directly. So I think I think it's getting even more granular. people will have very specific thesis that they understand and they have conviction on and and we're giving products for them to express that and and on the land side uh that's super interesting because I would bucket that under alternatives right like people want access to alternatives the only way to have access to alternatives right now is through REITs or these diversified indices but what people really want is to invest in an individual private company as easily as they can invest in a public stock and maybe they want an individual piece of land or a property in a neighborhood hood that they think is going to do well rather than just some like commercial real estate fund that has that has a portfolio everywhere because they can they can better understand whether that's going to go up or down. I think we're moving in that direction. Tokenization is uh is is solving a lot of the technical problems with that and of course there's regulatory hurdles that once we get through I think we'll will open up lots of alternative assets to retail investors.</p>

### 市场热点讨论：英伟达、AI 泡沫与 Meta

Amit: 好的，让我们转向英伟达。所以，你的朋友 Burry 做空了，兄弟。你没有足够说服他不要做空英伟达吗？还是发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Okay, let's let's transition to Nvidia. So, your boy Bur is short, bro. Did you not convince him enough that you don't go short Nvidia or what's going on here?</p>
</details>

Roy: 是的。不，我只是说有两家公司我认为是最大的骗局。他们不赚钱。他们有点像 AI 界的说唱歌手，并不真正销售真实的产品。那就是 Palantir 和英伟达。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. No, I just said that there's there's two companies that I think are uh the biggest frauds. They don't make any money. Um they're sort of like a AI rappers. They don't really sell a real product. And that's Palunteer and Nvidia. Um</p>
</details>

Amit: 老兄，你知道吗，这是英伟达自四月以来最好的一天。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> dude, you know, this was the best day for Nvidia since April.</p>
</details>

Roy: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah.</p>
</details>

Amit: 很多人都忽略了这一点。当我听到那个统计数据时，我想，真的吗？这是七个月来最好的一天。这是最好的一个月。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Like people are overlooking I when I heard that stat I was like really it was the best day in seven months. It was the best month.</p>
</details>

Roy: 作为他们的投资者感觉很好。是的。所以，我想我们上次谈过了，但他做空，嗯，技术上说不是做空，是看跌期权，但实际上就是做空。他对 Palantir 这样做，就像，我不会基于估值这样做，我认为它是一家了不起的公司等等。但对英伟达，这到底在哪个世界里说得通？Chris，你知道，他强调了 Michael Burry 的部分论点，即 AI 芯片需求是建立在谎言之上的，显然根据 Michael Burry 的说法，这似乎是……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Good feeling to be an investor in them. Yeah. It's I so this like I think we talked about it last time but him being well technically it's not a short it's puts but he effectively it's shorting um him doing that on Palunteer it's like it's it's I wouldn't do it based on valuation I think amazing company and all that but Nvidia it's like what world does this actually make sense and and Chris uh you know he highlighted part of the the argumentation of Michael Bur there was AI chip demand is built when it lies apparently according to to Michael Bur and that seems</p>
</details>

Amit: 在你说话的时候，我把它调出来。Tanner，我不知道你是否看到了，但他基本上是说所有的超大规模云服务商都在欺骗他们的投资者，通过夸大收益，因为他们没有计入 GPU 的折旧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">While you're talking, I'm going to pull it up. And Tanner, I don't know if you saw this, but he's basically saying all the hyperscalers are frauding their investors by overstating earnings because they're not accounting for depreciation in the GPUs.</p>
</details>

Tanner: 这是真的。我甚至不会说他 100% 错了。如果说在这个领域有什么地方可以进行最大规模的会计欺诈，那就是说折旧周期会比以前长得多。然而，我和一个真正从事这个行业的人聊过，他们说原因是训练和推理之间的差异，对 GPU 的实际压力要小得多，所以它们的寿命更长。他实际上谈到，今天进行的一些推理仍然在使用像 8 年前的 GPU。我完全不知道。所以，如果是这样的话，这可能是他们说这些 GPU 的生命周期会随着时间变得更长的一个原因。但即使是亚马逊，我认为他们也把他们的折旧年限从去年的六年降到了今年的五年。我不记得 Nebius 是多少，但非常低。他们非常保守。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> It is true. I won't even uh say that he's 100% wrong. If there is a place where you can have the biggest amount of accounting fraud, it is or in this space, it is saying that the depreciation is going to take much longer than before. However, I was talking with somebody that's actually in the space and they said the reason is is that because the difference between training and inference, it's much less uh stress on the actual GPUs, so they last much longer. Uh he was actually talking about how uh some of the inference that's being done today is still on like 8-year-old GPUs. I had no idea. So, um, if that is the case, that could be a reason why they're saying that they're the life the the um the life cycle of those GPUs is going to be much longer over time. But even I think Amazon even uh brought theirs down from six last year to five this year. Um, I don't remember what Nebius's is. It's it's extremely low though. They are being very conservative.</p>
</details>

Roy: 不过最后那句话，“更多细节将于 11 月 25 日公布，敬请期待。” 这是不是，你也提出了一点，我喜欢你在 X 上的问题，这是不是 Burry 的下一次“大空头”？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, that that last line though, more detail coming November 25th. Stay tuned. Is this and you you posited this a bit. I like the question on X of like is this Bur's next big short.</p>
</details>

Amit: 我觉得，老兄，他最近发的所有推文都非常明显地表明他不是这个 AI **capex**（Capital Expenditure: 资本支出，指公司用于购买、维护或升级固定资产的资金）周期的粉丝。所以，英伟达和 Palantir 的事，我甚至不知道他是否还在那个仓位上，但无论 11 月 25 日会发生什么，除非是新书发布，否则我猜想会是他对他仓位的进一步解释。我只是不知道这是否合理，因为做空英伟达意味着你做空整个市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I I dude everything he's been tweeting has been making it very obvious he is not a fan of this AI capex cycle. So, the Nvidia paler thing, I don't even know if he's still in the position, but whatever is coming November 25th, unless it's a book launch, I would imagine it's a further explanation of his positioning. Um, I just don't know if it makes sense because going short Nvidia means you're short the market</p>
</details>

Roy: 但 Roy，你怎么理解 Burry 说 Palantir 不懂得如何阅读 **13F**（Form 13F: 美国证券交易委员会要求管理超过1亿美元资产的机构投资者每季度披露其持股情况的报告）？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> No, but then but then but then Roy, how do you make sense of Bur saying that Palanteer doesn't understand how to read a 13F?</p>
</details>

Amit: 我认为他只是不爽，并且把 Alex Karp 的评论当成了个人攻击。他不喜欢被挑战，而且我认为他很少被挑战，除了人们取笑他预测了 500 个熊市中的一个准确了之类的。但是，这到底是什么意思？他们怎么会不知道如何阅读 13F？13F 表明你有一个看跌期权头寸。如果你没有，那没关系，但法律上没人知道。所以，这怎么会是 Palantir 的错？他到底在说什么？我不知道他是不是说他很快就平仓了，或者……

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I think he's just salty and he took Alex Garp's comments personally. He doesn't like to be challenged and I think he rar rarely is other than people teasing him that he predicted uh one of like 500 bare markets accurately or whatever it is. But um yeah, what does this even mean? How do they not know how to read a 13F? The 13F says you have a put position. If you don't, that's fine, but legally no one freaking knows. So, how is it Palantra's fault that like what is he even saying? I I don't know if he's saying like he he maybe got out like really quickly or</p>

### 东南亚市场动态：Grab 与 Goto 的并购传闻

Amit: 顺便说一句，你提到这个很有趣，因为就在刚才，我收到了一个通知。我明天会在开市节目上谈这个，各位，但这个故事越来越有趣了。软银正试图赶走 Goto 的 CEO。Goto 是他们在印尼最大的竞争对手。过去一周一直有传言说 Grab 正在寻求完成对他们的收购。软银在两家公司都有股份。而彭博社，这是 30 分钟前 10 点 16 分发布的消息。彭博社说孙正义正试图赶走这个人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, dude, it's funny you bring it up because just now I got a notification I'll talk about this tomorrow on the market open guys, but this story is getting juicy. Soft Bank is trying to get rid of the Goto CEO. Goto is their biggest competitor in Indonesia. There's been rumors over the past week that Grabs looking to actually complete an acquisition of them. SoftBank has a stake in both of them. And Bloomberg, this came out at 10:16 30 minutes ago. Bloomberg is saying Masasan's trying to get rid of this guy.</p>
</details>

Roy: 有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Interesting.</p>
</details>

Tanner: 有点疯狂。这真的有点疯狂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Kind of wild. That's kind of wild.</p>
</details>

Amit: 那么软银在 Grab 也有头寸，还是只在 Goto？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So, does Soft Bank also have a position in Grab or only in Goto?</p>
</details>

Roy: 两家都有。而 Goto 在过去五年里对他们来说是一场灾难。我的意思是，Grab 在股价方面也不好，但 Grab 即使股价那样，业务仍在增长。Goto 业务增长缓慢，股价也一塌糊涂。所以，我认为他们，其中一个原因是他们因为利润状况而竞争异常激烈。所以如果你把两家合并，即使你去掉 Goto 的金融科技部分，我的意思是，那真的可以加速利润率和整体增长。他们已经在 12 月 17 日申请召开一次特别股东大会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Both. And Goto has been a disaster for them for the past five year. I mean, Grab's also not been good share price-wise, but Grab is growing even if the stock is like that. Go to kind of growing and the stock is just like that. So, I think they and and one of the reasons is because they're so hyper competitive because of the margin profile. So if you were to just combine both of them, even if you got rid of the fintech part of Goto, I mean that could really accelerate margins and overall growth. And they filed for an extraordinary general meeting on December 17th.</p>
</details>

Amit: 所以看起来那里可能会有一些行动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So that looks like where potentially you could see some action.</p>
</details>

Roy: 好了，我想我们今天就到这里了，各位。我们下周再见。现在最大的市场催化剂是英伟达，就在下周。所以在那之前，你知道，政府关门应该会结束，希望这能继续给市场一些上涨的空间。
