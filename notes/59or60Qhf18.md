### 节目介绍

**Kyra Blackwell**: Christine，我很好奇你新年新气象的锻炼进行得怎么样了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Christine, I am very curious how your new me new year workouts are going.

</details>

**Christine Sirette**: 实际上，我很自豪地告诉你，因为我们去年关于居家力量训练的采访，我整个2025年都在进行力量训练。所以现在我进入2026年已经做好了准备。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: Actually, I'm proud to tell you that because of the interview that we had last year on strength training at home, I have had a little journey of strength training for all of 2025. So now I'm coming into 2026 prepared.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 我注意到你肌肉线条更明显了，看起来很强壮。我想很多人在这个月，也就是一月份，都会思考今年要如何健身。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: I have been noticing you're a little bit more muscly, a little bit more ripply. You look strong. Well, I think a lot of people this month, everybody kind of thinks about it in January. What am I doing this year for my fitness?

</details>

**Christine Sirette**: 很多人没有考虑到的，是他们运动后如何恢复。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: And something that a lot of people don't think about is how they're recovering after their workouts.

</details>

**Christine Sirette**: 我们将首先与**Lita Malik**博士对话。她是一位执业物理治疗师，也是**美国物理治疗协会**的发言人。她将向我们解释为什么在锻炼后花几分钟按摩身体、拉伸，做那些我们知道应该做但可能匆匆略过的事情很重要，身体里发生了什么，她还将分享一些你下次锻炼后可以尝试的简单技巧。她还是《**拉伸科学**》（The Science of Stretch）一书的作者，这本书详细阐述了我们今天将要讨论的内容。所以，她拥有丰富的专业知识。没错。节目稍后，休息回来后，我们将请来**Wire Cutter**的健身器材专家**Seth Burkeman**，深入探讨你可以在家进行快速恢复训练的工具。我们还将讨论何时值得在恢复器材上投入更多或更少。休息后，**Lita Malik**将与我们一起。稍后见。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: We're going to start off by talking with **Dr. Lita Malik**. She is a licensed physical therapist and a spokesperson for the **American Physical Therapy Association**. and she's going to join us to explain why spending a few minutes after your workout massaging your body, stretching, doing all those things that we kind of know we should do but might rush past, why that's important, what's happening in your body, and she's going to share some simple techniques that you might try after your next workout. She's also the author of a book called **The Science of Stretch**, which expands on what we're going to talk about today. So, she's got a lot of expertise. Yep, that's right. And then later on the show after the break, we'll bring on **Wire Cutter**'s own fitness gear expert, **Seth Burkeman**, to get into the tools you can use at home for a quick recovery session. We'll also talk about when it's worth spending more or less on recovery gear. **Lita Malik** will be with us after the break. See you in a sec.

### 运动后恢复的重要性

**Dr. Lita Malik**: 欢迎回来。现在我们邀请到了**Lita Malik**博士。**Malik**博士是一位执业物理治疗师，拥有物理治疗博士学位，并且是经委员会认证的运动临床专家。她与各种客户合作，从专业舞者到运动员，再到从伤病中康复的人。**Lita**，欢迎来到节目。谢谢邀请我。今天我们主要关注讨论恢复。为什么运动后恢复很重要。很多人这个月都在健身房锻炼。他们希望能全年坚持下去，但人们可能会尝试一些新的运动，运动后可能会感到酸痛。所以，我想问你第一个问题：为什么在锻炼结束时花时间做任何形式的恢复工作很重要？恢复工作只是让你有时间让身体在以任何方式锻炼后放慢速度。无论是好氧运动还是无氧运动，无论是有氧运动还是阻力训练，无论是低强度运动，静态或动态拉伸，泡沫轴滚动，还是进行冰浴或桑拿，更重要的是，它能让肌肉有时间恢复。我认为有一件经常被忽视的事情是锻炼之间发生的事情的重要性。我喜欢告诉人们，预留恢复时间可以让他们相应地安排，然后说：“好的，我的锻炼结束了，接下来我要做XYZ来恢复。”这可能包括在健身房做一些事情，或者你可能有一个晚上的例行程序，你睡得早一点，你喝了水合饮料等等。你提出的观点很好，恢复不仅仅是运动后的放松。恢复可以包括你的营养。它可以包括你对休息的关注等等。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lita Malik**: Welcome back. With us now is **Dr. Lita Malik**. Dr. Malik is a licensed physical therapist who holds a doctorate in physical therapy and is a board-certified sports clinical specialist. She works with a wide range of clients from pro dancers to athletes to people just rehabbing from injuries. Lita, welcome to the show. Thanks for having me. Today we are really focused on talking about recovery. Why it's important to recover after a workout. Lots of people are hitting the gym this month. They're hopefully going to keep doing it all year long, but people might be adopting some new exercises and maybe feeling sore after a workout. So, I just want to throw this first question at you. Why is it important to spend time at the end of a workout doing any kind of recovery work? Recovery work simply just allows you to set aside that time to give your body a chance to slow down after having worked in whatever way you your workout was. Whether it was aerobic or anorobic, so cardio or resistance training, whether it's just a lower intensity movement, static or dynamic stretching, foam rolling, getting into whatever ice bath or sauna or whatever it is, but more so that it just allows that time for muscle recovery. And I think one thing that often gets overlooked is the importance of what happens between workout sessions. I like to tell people that setting aside that recovery time just allows them to structure that accordingly and say, "Okay, so now that my workout's done, I'm going to be doing XYZ for my recovery." Whether that includes something in the gym or maybe you have a routine that night, you're sleeping a little bit earlier, you're drinking whatever hydration beverages, etc. And that's a great point that you make that it's not just about the cool down after your workout. Recovery could encompass your nutrition. It could encompass, you know, your focus on rest and everything.

</details>

**Christine Sirette**: 但我确实想回到运动后那几个时刻。假设我今天早上去了健身房。我做了一些举重。我跳了绳。我刚刚告诉**Kyra**，因为我每周做几次。我对此很着迷。从生理学角度来看，我的身体发生了什么变化，需要在我进行下一项活动之前进行某种调整？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sireette**: But I do want to go back to that moment or those few moments after a workout. Let's say I went to the gym this morning. I did some weights. I did some jump roping. I just told Kyra because that's what I do several times a week. Obsessed. Um, from a physiological standpoint, what's happening in my body that needs to have some kind of shift before I go on to the next thing?

</details>

**Dr. Lita Malik**: 天哪，你的心脏正在剧烈跳动。你的双脚在几分钟内多次着地，你的神经系统正处于活跃状态。血液流向你的所有四肢，你此刻非常活跃。所以，如果你不花时间稍微放松一下，然后马上投入一天的生活，给身体一个放慢速度的时刻，找到一天中其余时间的节奏是很好的。有时人们可能会有点匆忙，他们会把很多锻炼安排得非常紧凑，或者日程很忙，然后我们的整个身体就会进入超负荷状态。这不仅仅是你的肌肉发生了什么，还有你的神经系统。我认为这在24到48小时后你感觉如何的整体情况中扮演着重要角色，因为这场恢复游戏的一半是**压力管理**。所以，在锻炼后的那些时刻，给你的身体一个机会，让你的神经系统平静下来，心率下降，动作放缓，你用泡沫轴做一些按摩，这能让一切都放松一点，这尤其有帮助，特别是如果你早上锻炼完，之后还要去忙碌的工作，赶火车等等。这只是让身体恢复到基线状态。当人们问起恢复时，他们想知道的是什么能让我感觉不那么疲劳，更有活力，不那么酸痛，这样我的身体就能从刚刚完成的锻炼中恢复过来，并为下一次锻炼做好准备。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lita Malik**: Gosh, your heart is pumping. Your feet have been hitting the ground multiple times in some odd minutes and your nervous system is just you're going right now. There's blood flow going to all your limbs and you're really active in that moment. And so if you don't take time to cool down a little bit and you're going into your full day right afterwards, it's nice to give your body a moment to slow down and find that pace for the rest of the day. Sometimes people can be a little bit rushed and they stack a lot of workouts back to back to back or a busy day and then we run into this overdrive with the whole body. It's not just what's happening in your muscles, but it's your nervous system, too. And I think that plays a role in the whole picture of how well you're going to feel 24 to 48 hours later because half of this recovery game is **stress management**. So, in those moments after your workout, giving your body a chance to actually take your nervous system and dial it down, heart rate coming down, slower movements, you're doing a little bit of massage with the foam rolling, it just allows everything to relax a little bit more, which I think can be especially helpful, especially if you're in the morning getting a workout and you have to go to a busy workday right afterwards, catch the train, whatever it is. It just allows that to get back to baseline. And when people ask about recovery, it's what can make me feel less fatigued, more energized, less sore, so that my body can recover from that workout I just did and be prepared for the next one I'm about to do.

</details>

### 运动后恢复方法

**Christine Sirette**: 良好的运动后恢复方案是什么样的？如果人们在锻炼结束后只有10到15分钟，他们应该坚持做些什么而不是跳过？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: What does a good post-workout recovery routine look like? What should people try to commit to rather than skip if they only have 10 to 15 minutes after they're done with their workout?

</details>

**Dr. Lita Malik**: 你可以进行**拉伸**。拉伸是恢复中一个很好的重要部分。它不一定需要大量时间。你可以选择**静态拉伸**。人们倾向于选择这种方式，因为你不会马上进行更高强度的活动，你可以将拉伸保持更长时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lita Malik**: You could partake in **stretching**. Stretching is a nice vital part of recovery. It doesn't necessarily need a ton of time. You could choose **static stretching**. That's what people tend to lean towards because you're not about to do some higher level activity and you can hold that stretch for a little bit longer.

</details>

**Christine Sirette**: 什么是静态拉伸？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: What is a static stretch?

</details>

**Dr. Lita Malik**: 静态拉伸是指你保持拉伸姿势至少30秒。你也可以使用**泡沫轴滚动**。泡沫轴滚动基本上是另一种类似于按摩对身体作用的方式。泡沫轴滚动可以让你在滚动的肌肉中感觉更放松。它可以改善关节活动范围，就像静态拉伸一样，它还有助于排出肌肉中一些由运动引起的肿胀，也能让你感觉好一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lita Malik**: A static stretch is when you're going to be holding that stretch position for at least 30 seconds. And you can also use **foam rolling**. Foam rolling is basically another means of similar to what massage can do for the body. Foam rolling can do. So foam rolling can actually make you feel a lot looser in those muscles that you're rolling. It can improve range of motion as well as the static stretching and it helps to just flush some of that exercise induced swelling throughout the muscles and it can make you feel a little bit better too.

</details>

**Christine Sirette**: 我听过一些关于拉伸的相互矛盾的说法。你是在锻炼前还是锻炼后拉伸？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: So I've heard a couple of conflicting things about stretching. Should you stretch before or after your workout?

</details>

**Dr. Lita Malik**: 这取决于你的目标是什么。拉伸通常用于增加关节活动范围，减少肌肉僵硬或酸痛，或你可能感到的紧绷感，然后尝试对抗运动后出现的酸痛。所以，关于你是否应该进行静态拉伸，比如保持30秒或更长时间，还是保持**动态拉伸**，存在一些争议。动态拉伸是指你在活动范围内进出，并且保持时间通常在20秒以内。所以，如果我做腘绳肌拉伸并保持30秒，那就是静态拉伸。如果我想进出这个动作，我会向前倾，感受拉伸，保持大约10秒，然后放松，再回来，再做一次，保持10秒。那现在就是动态拉伸了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lita Malik**: It depends because it depends on what your goals are. Stretching is often used for increasing your range of motion, reducing muscle stiffness or soreness or that sense of tightness that you might feel and then trying to maybe battle some soreness that comes after the workout. So, there is some debate over whether you should hold a static stretch such as that 30 seconds or more or keep it dynamic. A **dynamic stretch** is one that you're moving in and out of the range of motion and you're keeping the holds under 20 seconds really. So, if I were to do a hamstring stretch and hold it for 30 seconds, that would be a static stretch. If I want to go in and out of it, I would lean in, get the stretch, hold it for maybe 10 seconds, back off, come back, do it again, hold it for 10 seconds. That would now be a dynamic stretch.

</details>

**Christine Sirette**: 所以，动态拉伸比静态拉伸更适合运动前？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: So, dynamic is a little bit better for before a workout than than static.

</details>

**Dr. Lita Malik**: 正确。好的，太棒了。是的。这些就像走路摸脚趾、走路时我们称之为“踢臀”的动作，或者你向后伸，把脚拉向臀部，诸如此类。所以你快速拉伸肌肉，然后把它收回来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lita Malik**: Correct. Okay, great. Yep. These are like walking toe touches, walking, we call them butt kicks, or you're reaching behind, pulling your foot towards your glute, that kind of thing. So, you're taking that muscle, stretching it real quick, and then bringing it back in.

</details>

**Christine Sirette**: 那么运动后就只做静态拉伸吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: And then after you just stick to static.

</details>

**Dr. Lita Malik**: 两种都可以。它们都有助于在运动后的两三天内减轻酸痛感。我想问你一个词，我认为在谈论泡沫轴滚动或任何形式的自我按摩，即**自我肌筋膜放松**时，这个词经常被提及。这个词是什么意思？肌筋膜就是指肌肉，而自我按摩意味着你自己做。所以使用泡沫轴时，你把它用在肌肉上，假设你觉得舒服，因为如果你讨厌它，你可能也得不到最大的益处，你的肌肉可能会因为你的防御而收紧。但理想情况下，你让肌肉在泡沫轴上滚动，这就像对肌肉和神经系统进行按摩一样。你从泡沫轴那里得到输入，这有助于减轻你正在滚动的肌肉的张力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lita Malik**: You can do either. They are both beneficial in that potential to make you feel less sore in those two and a half three days following the exercise. I want to ask you about this term that I think gets kind of thrown around when we talk about foam rolling or any kind of self-massage, **self myofascial release**. What does that term mean? So myofascial just means muscles and your self massage means that you're doing it. And so with the foam roller, you're using this over muscles, assuming you feel comfortable on one cuz also if you hate it, you're probably not going to get the most benefit out of it and your muscle might tighten up because you you're you're guarding. But ideally, you're getting a muscle and you're you're rolling it over the roller and that is acting like a massage both to the muscle, the nervous system. you're getting that input from the foam roller and that can help reduce muscle tension in the muscle that you're rolling.

</details>

### 冷热疗法

**Kyra Blackwell**: 我个人对**冷水浸泡**有点意见，很想听听你的看法。每当我使用冷水浸泡时，我的心跳加速，肌肉紧张，感觉非常糟糕。这真的适合作为放松环节吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: I have kind of a personal vendetta that I would love to get your take on. Um, **cold plunges**. Whenever I use one, my heart is racing. My muscles are tensing up. I'm having a horrible time. Is that actually like good for a cool down session?

</details>

**Dr. Lita Malik**: 我知道这会提出来。我早就知道了。你知道，可能你就是不喜欢冷水浸泡，这完全正常，因为真的很冷。但是，当我们的身体是温暖的，然后你进入冰浴时，你的身体必须调整以适应这种冲击。现在，关键是，这值得吗？我们知道的是，冷水浸泡可以帮助减轻运动后最初48到72小时内的肌肉酸痛感。当你需要立即进行另一次高强度锻炼、比赛或游戏时，这会很有帮助，这就是为什么我们看到很多高水平运动员会这样做。它还会抑制身体在进行高强度力量训练或出现**肌肉肥大**后用于构建的炎症反应。所以，在力量训练日后立即进行冷水浸泡，你可能会适得其反。有很多其他方法可以让你在今天的锻炼后感觉不那么酸痛。我还能做些什么吗？是的，当然有。我们有**加压**、**泡沫轴滚动**、**温和拉伸**、**按摩**、**冷水**。所以，这些都是可以帮助你减轻酸痛感的方法，而且不一定非要在冰冷的水中进行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lita Malik**: I knew this was going to come up. I I I knew it. You know, it might just be that you just really don't like cold punches, and that's a totally normal thing to not like because it's very cold. But it is when we're going from your body's warm, you're getting into an ice bath, your body is going to have to adjust to accommodate that shock. Right now, the the kicker is, is it worth it? Here's what we know. That **cold water immersion** can help reduce feelings of muscle soreness in that first 48 hours to 72 hours after exercise. This can be helpful when you have another hard workout or competition or game or whatever you have to do right away, which is why we see a lot of the higher level athletes doing it. It also does blunt that inflammatory response that your body uses to build on it when you just did a heavier strength training day or you have that **hypertrophy** coming after that inflammatory response. So, by doing that cold water immersion right after your strength day, you might be doing yourself a disservice. There's so many other ways to give yourself that I want to feel less sore after today's workout. Is there anything else I can do? Yes, there absolutely is. We have **compression**. We have **foam rolling**, **gentle stretching**, **massage**, **cold water**. So, these are all ways that can help you feel less sore and that don't necessarily have to be in a frizzing cold water.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 嗯，我很感谢你的认可。我再也不会进行冷水浸泡了。我们必须谈谈相反的情况。那么热呢？桑拿或热水浴缸，如果你能接触到的话，对恢复有好处吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Well, I appreciate your approval. I'm never getting another cold plunge again. We have to talk about the opposite. What about heat? is a sauna or a hot tub, if you've got access to that, something that's good to do for recovery.

</details>

**Dr. Lita Malik**: 当我们研究这些不同的方式并找出哪种最有效时，热和冰的效果非常接近。区别在于，对于活动后最初的48小时内，冰的效果往往更好。如果你酸痛的时间稍长，或者你觉得肌肉在第三天和第四天仍然紧张，那么热的效果往往更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lita Malik**: When we're looking at these different modalities and figuring out which is, you know, what's the most effective? So, heat and ice are pretty close. The difference is for those immediate, like the first 48 hours right after activity, ice tends to do a little bit better. If you're sore a little bit longer or you feel like your muscles are tense on day three and four, heat tends to do better for that.

</details>

### 营养、水分与休息

**Christine Sirette**: 那么，除了这些，运动后还能关注什么来达到最佳恢复效果呢？当你离开健身房，开始考虑下一餐，考虑你得到的休息时，这些是如何发挥作用的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: So, what else could somebody focus on after a workout for optimal recovery? When you've left the gym and you're now thinking about your next meal, you're thinking about the rest that you've gotten. Like, how does that all play into it?

</details>

**Dr. Lita Malik**: 你肯定要补充水分。你需要在锻炼前、锻炼中和锻炼后都喝水。无论你是否需要电解质，如果你出汗很多，如果天气潮湿，你都需要保持水分充足。**补水**是非常重要的一部分。确保你在接下来的餐食中补充**蛋白质**和**碳水化合物**也是一件大事。这将使你的能量水平恢复，为你的肌肉提供它们所需的东西，以修复我们刚刚在锻炼中故意造成的微小损伤，帮助它们再生。你应该考虑你的餐食。你应该考虑，我怎样才能给我的身体它现在需要的东西，以充分利用我的锻炼？我现在完全把它当作一个自助热线了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lita Malik**: You definitely want to replenish **hydration**. You want to have been drinking your water before your workout, during your workout, and after. Whether you need the electrolytes or not, if you were really sweaty, if it was humid, you want to keep that all on on key. Hydration is a really big portion of it. And making sure you're replenishing both with **protein** and **carbs** in your following meals are a big thing. That's going to bring your energy levels back up. That's going to give your muscles what they need to build on the little micro damage that we just did. That was intentional in the exercises to help them regenerate. And you should think about your meals. You should think about, okay, how can I go give my body what it needs now to make the most out of my workout? I'm totally using this as like a self-help hotline at this point.

</details>

**Christine Sirette**: 我喜欢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: I love it.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 抱歉。我锻炼后很容易崩溃。我必须至少睡30分钟的午觉，因为我感觉太累了。这是因为我平时休息不够，还是我吃得不够，或者水分不够？我做错了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Sorry. I have a tendency to just crash after my workouts. I have to take at least a 30-minute nap because I just feel so drained. Is that because I'm not resting enough just in my regular life or I'm not eating enough or hydrating enough? What am I doing wrong?

</details>

**Dr. Lita Malik**: 天哪，可能所有这些原因都有。该死。嗯，我知道这很难说，除非你退一步，审视所有事情。但关于我们能做些什么来帮助减少运动后那种崩溃的感觉，就是在运动前吃够东西，获得良好的安稳睡眠，确保你吃够东西是确保你运动后不崩溃的很大一部分。我非常注重确保你选择的运动和完成它们的强度不会让你感到精疲力尽。所以，确保它们足够有挑战性，让你能够完成，而不会觉得那是世界上最难的事情。你不一定非要达到力竭，但要接近力竭，并成功完成。在你的组间，你要进行休息，因为那也会有所不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lita Malik**: Man, it could be all of the above. Dang it. Um, I know it it it is hard to say unless you take a, you know, take a step back and you look at everything. But with regards to what we can do to help reduce that feeling of that crash after the workout is eating enough beforehand, getting good restful nights sleep, making sure you're eating enough is a huge portion of making sure you don't crash after the workout. I'm big on making sure you're choosing exercises and completing them at an intensity that doesn't feel depleting. So, making sure they're challenging enough that you can actually complete it without feeling like that was the hardest thing in the world. You're not necessarily hitting failure, but you're getting close, but successful. And between your sets, you are taking your rest breaks because that's going to make a difference, too.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 是的，我想我刚刚学到了很多关于我做错了什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Yeah, I think I just learned a lot about what I'm doing wrong.

</details>

**Christine Sirette**: 记笔记。做个清单。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: Taking notes. Make a checklist.

</details>

**Dr. Lita Malik**: 我们谈了很多。所以，我想简单回顾一下我们讨论的要点。总的来说，在锻炼结束时花一点时间进行恢复很重要。这是因为你需要给自己减压。你需要让你的神经系统平静下来。在锻炼结束时，你可以进行静态或动态拉伸。在锻炼开始时，你可能想做更多的动态拉伸或激活。你可能想考虑其他类型的恢复方式，比如使用**加压**、**泡沫轴自我按摩**、使用**热敷**或**冷敷**。然后，你应该考虑你的**营养**、**水分**和**休息**，作为整个恢复方案的一部分。我简直像在旁边欢呼，是的，是的，是的。你知道，恢复是你的机会，让你将身体刚刚承受的受控压力进行调节，让它有时间恢复，从而改善你的功能，并在下一次锻炼中变得更强。这必须是有意的，我认为只有这样人们才能从中获得最大的益处。非常感谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dr. Lita Malik**: We've talked about a lot. So, I want to just briefly recap sort of the main points that we've talked about. So, overall, it's just important to take a little bit of time at the end of a workout to recover. And that's because you need to de-stress yourself a bit. You need to bring your your nervous system back down. You want to focus at the end of a workout. You can be doing static or dynamic stretching. At the beginning of a workout, you might want to be doing more dynamic stretching or activation. You might want to think about other types of modalities like using **compression**, **self massage** on a **foam roller**, using **heat** or **cold**. And then you should think about your **nutrition**, your **hydration**, and your **rest** in terms of sort of the whole recovery package. I've literally like cheering over here like yes, yes, yes. You know, recovery is your chance to take that controlled amount of stress that you just put it through your body through and give it a moment to regulate that to improve your function and come back even stronger for the next workout. It has to be intentional and I think that's when people get the most out of it. Thank you so much.

**Christine Sirette**: 谢谢你。

**Christine Sirette**: It's good to see you, too. It's great to have you back. We chatted with you last year around this time about weight training and resistance training and all that good stuff. I'm happy to be talking about recovery today. So, Seth, if somebody wanted to build a basic starter kit for all the essential tools needed for a post-workout recovery, what do you recommend?

</details>

**Seth Burkeman**: 我认为你首先应该从**瑜伽垫**开始。我认为它为很多运动后恢复拉伸提供了基础。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seth Burkeman**: I think you would first want to start actually with a **yoga mat**. I think that provides a lot of grounding and the basis for a lot of the post-workout recovery stretching that you might be doing.

</details>

**Seth Burkeman**: 接下来，我会考虑**泡沫轴**。它们很棒，因为它们有各种不同的形状、尺寸和密度。所以，你可以找到一个特别适合有针对性恢复的泡沫轴。你想锻炼身体的某些部位。然后是可选的升级。你可能还会考虑**按摩枪**，它可能比泡沫轴能提供更多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seth Burkeman**: Next, I would think about **foam rollers**. They're great because they come in different various shapes and sizes and densities. And so, you can find a foam roller in particular for targeted recovery. You want to do certain parts of your body. And then optional upgrade. Something you might consider as well is a **massage gun** for maybe something a little bit more than what a foam roller can provide.

</details>

**Christine Sirette**: 好的。那么，我们从瑜伽垫开始。当我们看你的指南时，你推荐的瑜伽垫价格从25美元到100多美元不等。所以，我想每个人都知道瑜伽垫是什么，但可能不确定为什么有人会花那么多钱。你能从中得到什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: Okay. So, let's start with the yoga mat. When we look at your guide, you have yoga mats that can range from $25 to over $100. So, I think everybody knows what a yoga mat is, but maybe people are not quite sure why anybody would spend that much more money. What are you getting out of that?

</details>

**Seth Burkeman**: 所以，我认为如果你只是寻找专门用于恢复的东西，而且这主要是你锻炼后要做的事情，一个你可以坐着做瑜伽、拉伸、呼吸练习的表面。我们推荐的经济型选择，**Yoga Accessories Extra Thick Deluxe Yoga Mat**，你提到价格大约25美元，应该足以满足你的需求。它是一个很棒的垫子。你也可以用它进行更激烈的活动，但它确实为简单的恢复方案提供了一个完美的基层。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seth Burkeman**: So, I think if you were looking for just something for recovery only, and that's mainly what you're going to do after your workout, a surface that you can sit on and do yoga, do stretching, do breathing exercises. Our budget pick, the **Yoga Accessories Extra Thick Deluxe Yoga Mat**, which you mentioned costly around $25, should more than suffice what you're looking for. It's a great mat. You can also use it for more intense activities, but it does provide that that perfect kind of base layer for a simple kind of recovery routine.

</details>

**Christine Sirette**: 是的，我家里就有一个，我一直用着。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: Yeah, I have that one at home and I've had it.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 我也有。我喜欢它。它很好。很结实。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: I have it, too. I like it. It's good. It's solid.

</details>

**Seth Burkeman**: 我的意思是，如果你不仅仅是用于恢复，你可能会寻找更昂贵的，或者我们其他的选择，它们确实会贵一点。**Lululemon Mat**之所以长期以来一直是我们的首选之一，是因为它是双面的。所以它有两个表面。例如，我个人使用**Lululemon Mat**时，当我做高强度间歇训练（HIT）等需要大量跳跃的运动时，我使用上面更光滑的一面。然后，当你想要做更多拉伸或那种运动恢复时，它有一个更柔软的感觉，你可以躺下，让身体沉浸在瑜伽垫更柔软、泡沫状的部分。更贵的瑜伽垫会更耐用吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seth Burkeman**: I mean, you may look for something more expensive or some of our other picks, which do cost a bit more money if you're going to be using the yoga mat for more than just recovery. One of the reasons why the **Lululemon Mat** has long been a pick for us is it's double-sided. So, it is two surfaces. For example, my personal usage, I use the **Lululemon Mat**, the top more slick side when I'm doing like HIT exercises where I'm going to be jumping around a lot. Then it has a more sort of softer feel when you want to do more stretching or that kind of workout recovery where you can lay down, immerse your body in kind of the softness, the foamy more section of the yoga mat. Will a more expensive yoga mat last longer?

</details>

**Seth Burkeman**: 我认为总的来说，当你为瑜伽垫多花一点钱时，更贵的垫子确实有更耐用的声誉。材料更坚固。我认为，例如，我喜欢使用**Yoga Accessories**垫子，也就是我们的经济型选择。我确实注意到那个垫子可能会掉屑更多一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seth Burkeman**: I think in general when you do pay a bit more for a yoga mat, a more expensive one does come with the reputation that it will last you a bit longer. The materials are a bit stronger. I think for example, I love using the **Yoga Accessories** mat or budget pick. I do notice a little bit more shedding maybe on that mat.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 我注意到了，所以我才想知道。好的。我有一些塑料或橡胶之类的东西，有些地方有点剥落。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: I noticed that's why I wanted to know. Okay. I have kind of like the plastic or the rubber or whatever is kind of like peeling off a little bit in spots.

</details>

### 泡沫轴的选择

**Christine Sirette**: 好的。我们已经谈论了瑜伽垫。现在我们来谈谈泡沫轴。你为什么要用它？什么让一个泡沫轴好用？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: Okay. So, we've talked about yoga mats. Let's turn to foam rollers. Why do you use one and what makes one good?

</details>

**Seth Burkeman**: 是的。泡沫轴，你知道，当你寻求**肌筋膜放松**，那种肌肉的自我靶向时。泡沫轴有各种不同的形状和尺寸，它们非常适合你确定你能承受多大的压力，以及什么能给你带来那种放松感，并增加放松的能力。它们在锻炼前后都非常有益，无论是小的、有凸起的，还是更平坦的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seth Burkeman**: Yeah. Uh **foam rollers**, you know, when you're looking for that **myofacial release**, that self-targeting of muscles. Foam rollers come in all different shapes and sizes and are really good for you to be able to determine one how much pressure you can kind of tolerate, but also what gives you that sort of relaxation and adds to that ability to cool down. Those are very beneficial both before and after a workout, whether it be a small one, one with ridges, one that's more so flat.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 因为它本质上就像是**自我按摩**，对吧？你基本上是用泡沫轴按摩你的肌肉。但是…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: because it's essentially like a **self massage**, right? You're basically massaging your muscles with a foam roller. But

</details>

**Christine Sirette**: 那为什么会那么痛？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: then why does it hurt so much?

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 你难道没做过会痛的按摩吗？是的，有时会。但我不是，按摩的时候更有趣，而不是用泡沫轴。是的。是的。是的。泡沫轴有很多不同的密度。我知道我去健身房时，有些泡沫轴非常坚硬，几乎像混凝土一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Haven't you ever had a massage that hurts? Yeah, sometimes. But I don't It's more fun that way when it's massage, not a foam roller. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um there are a lot of different densities of foam rollers. I know I've been to the gym where they're so firm they it almost seems like concrete.

</details>

**Seth Burkeman**: 它就像一根柱子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seth Burkeman**: It's like a column.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 是的。没错。然后我家里有一个比较软的，用起来感觉不那么粗糙。你为什么要选择一种密度而不是另一种？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Yeah. Exactly. And then I have one at home that is softer it feels a little less abrasive, I guess, when I'm using it. Why would you go for one density over another?

</details>

**Seth Burkeman**: 我认为在运动后恢复方面，你可能想倾向于密度稍软的。我通常在运动后恢复时一直使用我们指南中目前推荐的**Gam Restore Total Body Foam Roller**。它是一种更柔软、更海绵状的材料，所以它能让你的身体稍微下沉一点，但你知道，当你在上面滚动时，无论是你的腘绳肌、臀部还是背部，你仍然能感受到压力。如果你把它想象成有一个坚硬的中心核心，周围环绕着更海绵状的柔软材料，那就是**Gam**泡沫轴的样子。其他一些泡沫轴则完全是聚苯乙烯泡沫材料。所以，这部分是个人偏好，以及你能承受多少压力，你想给身体施加多少压力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seth Burkeman**: I think when it comes to post-workout recovery, you may want to gravitate towards something that's a bit softer in density. I normally use the **Gam Restore Total Body Foam Roller** that we currently recommend in our guide all the time when I'm recovering from a workout. It's a more softer kind of spongier material to it and so it lets your body sink in a little bit, but you know, when you're rolling on it, whether it be your hamstrings or your hips or your back, you're still getting that pressure. If you think of it almost as having like a hard center core that's surrounded by a more spongy softer material, that's what the **Gam** roller is like. Some of the other rollers are just pure styrofoamy material all throughout. And so part of that is personal preference and how much you can take and how much of that pressure you want to put on your body.

</details>

**Christine Sirette**: 那么**Gam**的价格是多少？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: And how much does the Gam cost?

</details>

**Seth Burkeman**: 它的价格通常在30到40美元之间。然后，它严格来说不是泡沫轴，但它在我们的泡沫轴指南中。我们长期推荐的是**Tiger Tail**，它本质上是一根稍长的塑料棒。它大约有2英尺长，但它有一个更柔软的中心，就像如果你想到一个粘毛滚筒。不幸的是，它不吸附绒毛。但如果你要滚动它，你会用双手握住它，然后中间部分就是你在身体上滚动的地方。所以，如果你想到擀面杖，当你擀面团时，你用它在身体上按摩肌肉的动作是完全一样的，而且它不占用太多空间。我经常使用它，我认为它对恢复真的很好，因为它对你的身体更具适应性。它大约40美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seth Burkeman**: It ranges in price from about $30 to $40 usually. And then it's not technically a foam roller, but it's in our foam roller guide. But something that we've long recommended is the **Tiger Tail**, which is essentially a bit of a longer plastic rod. It's about 2 feet in length, but it does have a softer center where it's almost like if you think about a lint roller. It doesn't absorb lint, unfortunately. But if you were to roll it, you would hold in both your hands and then the middle part is what you would roll on your body. So, if you think about a rolling pin and when you're rolling out dough, that's the same exact motion that you're using with it against your body as you're massaging those muscles and it doesn't take up as much space. That's something I use a lot and I think is really good for recovery just because it is a bit more adaptable to your body. It's about $40.

</details>

**Christine Sirette**: 所以，那不是你躺在上面的泡沫轴。它是你对着身体滚动的，你不是躺在地板上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: And so, that's not a foam roller you lay on. It's one that you're just rolling against your body like you're not on the floor laying on it.

</details>

### 按摩枪的利弊

**Christine Sireette**: 好的，我们已经谈论了瑜伽垫，谈论了泡沫轴。我想谈谈这些工具中更“性感”的，那就是**按摩枪**。你称它为可选的，所以你可能认为它不是必需品，我想深入探讨这一点。我们想知道它们是否真的有效。如果你在这上面挥霍，它会完成它的工作吗？以及后续问题，它能取代泡沫轴吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sireette**: Okay, so we've talked about yoga mats, we've talked about foam rollers. I want to get into the sexier of these tools, which is a **massage gun**. You call this an optional one, so maybe you think that it's not a necessity, and I want to get into that. We want to know if they actually work. If you're splurging on this thing, will it do its job? And follow up, can it replace a foam roller?

</details>

**Seth Burkeman**: 已经有很多研究试图探究按摩枪的有效性，但真的没有一个明确的“是”或“否”的答案。它们有益吗？你可能从中获得的最大益处就是它的感觉如何？你觉得它放松吗？而这种心理上的东西正是许多研究或科学家谈论人们从按摩枪中获得的益处，至于实际放松和舒缓肌肉，按摩枪是否能提供这一点，目前尚无定论。我的部分想法是，很多人喜欢它们是因为它们看起来很酷。我不知道。部分原因可能是它们比实际滚动或自己使用**Tiger Tail**更容易使用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seth Burkeman**: It's it's you know the studies have been done trying to look into the effectiveness of **massage guns** and there really isn't a definitive answer of yes or no. Are they beneficial? The biggest benefit you may get out of it is just how does it feel? Do you find it relaxing? And that sort of psychological thing is what a lot of studies or scientists talk about the benefit that people get from massage gun in terms of actual releasing and soothing muscles. It's up in the air whether or not massage guns can provide that. I mean, part of me thinks a lot of people like them because they look cool. I don't know. Part of it could be they are easier to use than actually rolling out or using a **Tiger Tail** by yourself.

</details>

**Christine Sirette**: 它比泡沫轴更好吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: Is it better than a foam roller?

</details>

**Seth Burkeman**: 我不会明确这么说。我认为它可能更容易使用。例如，我经常使用**Theragun Mini**，它是我们按摩枪指南中的一个推荐产品。尽管它的振幅或力度不如大型按摩枪，但我喜欢它，因为它能深入身体的某些缝隙，比如我的腘绳肌下方。这样握住按摩枪对我来说更容易。如果我使用一个大两三倍的按摩枪，在身体的某些角度操作它就不那么容易了。但零星地使用小型按摩枪，我觉得确实能达到我用大型按摩枪无法达到的针对性效果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seth Burkeman**: I wouldn't definitively say so. I think it may be a bit more accessible. For example, I often use the **Theragun Mini**, which is one of the picks in our massage gun guide. And even though that one doesn't have the same amplitude or force that a bigger massage gun has, I like that because it can get into certain crevices of the body that are just like underneath my hamstring. It's easier for me to hold the massage gun that way. As if I was using a bigger massage gun that's two, three times the size. Maneuvering that around just certain angles of your body isn't the easiest. But using a smaller massage gun sporadically, I feel does kind of get that targeting that I can't get with a bigger one.

</details>

**Christine Sirette**: 因为**Theragun**普通尺寸的有点像一个粗大的电钻。它相当大。那么价格差异是多少？因为我知道你说它容易使用，但这与它的成本无关。这只是说它比使用泡沫轴可能更容易上手。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: Because the **Theragun**, the regular size one, is kind of the size of like a chunky drill, like a power drill. It's pretty big. So, what is the price difference there? Because I know you said it's accessible, but that's not relating to how much it costs. That's just it's a little bit more approachable than maybe using a foam roller.

</details>

**Seth Burkeman**: 是的。所以，**Mini**的零售价大约是220美元。哦，那不便宜。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seth Burkeman**: Yeah. And so, the **Mini** retail costs about $220. Oh, that's not cheap.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 有时它会打折50美元。你会看到，**Theragun**现在大约340美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Sometimes it's on sale for like $50 off. You'll see. **Theragun** now costs around 340.

</details>

**Christine Sirette**: 花这么多钱买一个不一定有效果的东西，真是太多了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: That's a lot of money for something that doesn't necessarily have,

</details>

**Seth Burkeman**: 对吧？所以我们现在正在讨论是否要继续推荐**Theragun**，因为它太贵了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seth Burkeman**: right? And so we're right now debating whether or not to keep the **Theragun** a pick because it costs so much money.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 搞定了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Done.

</details>

**Seth Burkeman**: 嗯，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seth Burkeman**: Um,

</details>

**Christine Sirette**: 你是第一个听到这个消息的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: you heard it here first.

</details>

**Seth Burkeman**: 他们确实生产其他相同尺寸但更便宜的按摩枪，它们可能没有那么多速度，也没有那么多附件。电池寿命可能更短。所以你真的需要考虑，第一，你会用它多少次？我需要这个看起来像球的附件，还是那个看起来像小凸起的附件？你知道，如果你觉得它能给你想要的恢复效果，谁又能剥夺你这种益处呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seth Burkeman**: They do make other the guns same size that are cheaper that don't have as many speeds or don't come with as many attachments. the battery life may be a bit shorter. And so you really have to think about one, how much are you going to use it? How much do I need this one attachment that looks like a ball versus one that looks more like a little nub? You know, if you feel that it gives you the kind of recovery that you want, who's to say to rub anyone of that kind of benefit of it?

</details>

**Christine Sirette**: 我们在指南中也有一个100美元的推荐，对吧？就像**Maybach**之类的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: We also have a $100 recommendation in the guide right now, right? It's like the **Maybach** or something.

</details>

**Seth Burkeman**: **Maybach**被推荐了，而且它便宜很多。那个按摩枪很重。我们经常与我们的付费测试小组一起测试按摩枪。付费测试小组包括有某些身体残疾、某些体型的人，他们真的能给我们一个独特的视角，了解他们在产品中寻找的挑战或东西，他们提供的输入和反馈真的很有帮助。他们发现**Theragun**的手柄本质上是三角形的。所以你可以从不同的角度和视角握住它。**MiBach**只有一个手柄。所以对于一些人来说，无论是由于握力还是其他原因，他们有时会觉得操作起来有点困难。所以这可能是你在考虑选择一个按摩枪而不是另一个时需要考虑的因素。你可能想考虑的一件事是，我不知道你是否了解**按摩球**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seth Burkeman**: is is recommended and that's a lot less expensive. That gun is pretty heavy. We often test massage guns with our paid tester panel. Paid tester panel includes people with certain physical disabilities, certain body types, and they're really able to give us a unique perspective of some of the challenges or things that they look for in products and really helpful the input and feedback that they give. And they found that the so the handle of the **Theragun** is like a triangle essentially. So you can grip it from different angles and perspectives. the **MiBach** just has one handle. And so for some people, whether it be because of grip strength or other reasons, they find it a bit harder to maneuver sometimes. And so that might be a consideration when you're thinking about one massage gun over another. One thing that you might want to consider is I don't know if you know about **massage balls**.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 哦，是的。我以前见过这些，我妈妈是按摩治疗师，所以我见过。但你先告诉我们它们是什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Oh, yeah. I've seen these before and my mom's a massage therapist so I have. But you tell us tell us first what they are.

</details>

**Seth Burkeman**: 是的。按摩球本质上，如果你想到一个网球大小的东西，或者甚至更小一点。它们通常用于你的颈部后方，或者也可以用于你的腿部。所以你只是将它们对着你的肌肉进行按摩，以给你带来与按摩枪或滚筒相同的张力，相同的缓解感，就像深层组织按摩一样，但你能够自己控制它，使用这两个，或者你想用多少个球都可以。而且它们相当便宜。是的，我妈妈是按摩治疗师，她教我的一个便宜的小窍门是，拿一个按摩球或网球，把它放进一根长袜里。所以，就像想到一双过膝袜，然后你可以把球压在你的背上，你靠在墙上，然后你可以通过拉起或放下袜子来控制球落在你背部的哪个位置。我发现它真的很有帮助。但我发现按摩球比网球更硬一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seth Burkeman**: Yeah. **Massage balls** are essentially, if you think about something the size of a tennis ball or maybe even a bit smaller. Um, they're often used on the back of your neck or they can be used on your legs. And so you're just massaging them essentially against your muscles to give you that same kind of tension, that same kind of relief that a massage gun or a roller, same kind of feeling like a deep tissue massage would, but you're able to one just control it, do it yourself with these two, however many balls you want to use. And they're they're pretty inexpensive. Yeah, my mom is a massage therapist and the cheap hack that she has shown me to do is to either take a massage ball or a tennis ball and put it into a long sock. So, like think of it like a knee high sock and then you can you can press the ball against your back and you're like leaning against the wall and then you can control where the ball lands on your back by pulling the sock up or or letting it go back down. I found it really really helpful. But I found that with the massage balls, they're they tend to be a little more firm than the tennis balls.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 对。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Right. Yeah,

</details>

**Seth Burkeman**: 你说得对。这是一种非常非常便宜的获得那种有针对性按摩的方法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seth Burkeman**: you're right. It's like a very very cheap way to get that sort of targeted massage.

</details>

**Christine Sirette**: **Seth**，你还有没有其他推荐的恢复工具是我们没有谈到的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: Seth, are there any other tools that you would recommend for recovery that we haven't talked about?

</details>

**Seth Burkeman**: 人们可能会考虑**阻力带**。我知道它们通常被认为是实际的锻炼工具，或者你可能用来热身的东西，但它们对于有针对性的拉伸练习很有用，这取决于你的锻炼，你可能想在某个一直困扰你的区域进行额外的针对性拉伸，或者你觉得某个部位比身体其他部位更需要放松时，使用**阻力带**，特别是**迷你环形带**，可能会有益。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seth Burkeman**: One thing people might consider are **resistance bands**. I know that they're often thought of as actual, you know, during workout tools or things that you might use to warm up, but they are good for kind of targeted stretching exercises, which depending on your workout, you might want to include if you're looking to kind of just get a little extra targeted stretching in a certain area that's been bothering you or you feel like needs a bit more loosening up than other parts of your body, using **resistance bands**, particularly the **mini loop bands**, those would be possibly of benefit.

</details>

**Christine Sirette**: 太棒了。听起来我家里已经有了所有我需要恢复的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: Great. It sounds like I've got all of the things that I need to recover at home.

</details>

**Seth Burkeman**: 嗯，你是个锻炼高手，我们去年就发现了。好的，**Christine**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seth Burkeman**: Well, you're a workout pro and we discovered that last year. Okay, Christine.

</details>

**Christine Sirette**: 好的，**Seth**，我们到了最后一个问题。你最近买的你真正喜欢的东西是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: Okay, Seth, we made it to our final question. What's the last thing you bought that you really loved?

</details>

**Seth Burkeman**: 我刚买了一台**Nintendo Switch 2**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seth Burkeman**: I just bought a **Nintendo Switch 2**.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 你是怎么买到的？那不是现在很抢手吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: HOW DID YOU GET IT? Isn't that just a hot commodity right now?

</details>

**Seth Burkeman**: 我觉得它们很漂亮。我不知道我在哪里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seth Burkeman**: I think they're like pretty. I don't know where I am.

</details>

**Christine Sirette**: 是的，我觉得我太老了，玩不了电子游戏。我跟我们的电子游戏专家**Haley**谈过这个问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: Yeah, I feel like I'm too old to play video games. I've talked with **Haley**, our video game expert, about this.

</details>

**Seth Burkeman**: 我还是想玩，但我就是玩不进去。但我觉得也许有了**Switch**的便携性会有帮助。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seth Burkeman**: I still want to play, but I just can't get into it. But I feel like maybe having the portability of a **Switch** will help me.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 你把这说得好像是一份你必须做的工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: You're making this sound like it's a job that you have to

</details>

**Seth Burkeman**: 我知道，是的。而且

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seth Burkeman**: I know that's Yeah. And

</details>

**Christine Sirette**: 强迫你玩电子游戏。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: forcing you to play video games.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 你选择的游戏是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: What's your game of choice?

</details>

**Seth Burkeman**: 我真的很期待玩两款游戏。一款是《**模拟农场**》（Farming Simulator）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seth Burkeman**: There are two games that I'm really looking forward to playing. One is **Farming Simulator**.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 好的。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Okay. Yeah.

</details>

**Seth Burkeman**: 然后还有一款，我相信它是可以玩的。这是一款日本游戏，但它像火车一样。你建造铁路和地铁。所以你经营这个建造铁路的生意。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seth Burkeman**: And then there's this I believe it's playable. It's It's a Japanese game, but it's like a train. You build like railroads and subways. And so you run this business building railroads.

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 酷。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: Cool.

</details>

**Christine Sirette**: 我喜欢这个。这听起来很有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: I like this. This sounds fun.

</details>

**Christine Sirette**: 好的，**Seth**，非常感谢。这太棒了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: Well, Seth, thank you so much. This was great.

</details>

**Seth Burkeman**: 谢谢邀请我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seth Burkeman**: Thanks for having me.

</details>

### 总结与反思

**Christine Sirette**: **Kyra**，你感觉准备好了吗？恢复了吗？你觉得从这次采访中恢复了吗？你觉得准备好从锻炼中恢复了吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: Kyra, do you feel ready and recovered? Do you feel recovered from this interview? Do you feel ready to recover from your workout?

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 如此放松，如此准备好恢复。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Kyra Blackwell**: so relaxed and so ready to recover.

</details>

**Christine Sirette**: 那么，你从我们两次对话中得到了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christine Sirette**: So, what did you take away from both conversations we had?

</details>

**Kyra Blackwell**: 哦，我学到了很多。我学到我锻炼前没有真正吃东西，这可能是我之后崩溃的原因。

**Kyra Blackwell**: Oh, I learned so much actually. I learned that I I don't actually eat before my workout and that's probably what's causing me to crash after the fact.

**Christine Sirette**: 是的。

**Christine Sirette**: Yeah,

**Kyra Blackwell**: 我总是尽量避免吃早餐，因为我吃得很多，这让我感觉迟钝，但我会尝试一下，看看会发生什么。是的。嗯，从**Seth**那里，我学到按摩枪虽然看起来很酷，但可能不值得挥霍。我的意思是，如果你想要，那就买吧，但我只是觉得我不会那么做。我确实想投资的是，我目前有一个经济型泡沫轴，它非常坚硬，我了解到我可以尝试更柔软的，因为那个有点粗糙。

**Kyra Blackwell**: I always try to avoid eating breakfast because I do eat a lot and it makes me feel sluggish, but I'm just going to just try it and see what happens. Yeah. Um, from Seth, I have kind of taken away that massage guns, while they look cool, aren't maybe worth the splurge. I mean, if you want it, do you, boo, but I I just don't think I'll do that. What I do think I am going to invest in, I currently have the budget pick foam roller, and it's very firm, and I've learned that I can I can branch out and do something softer cuz that one is a little abrasive.

**Christine Sirette**: Yeah, I love my my foam roller. It's a little bit softer. It's really great for after a workout. Yeah, I now think I understand a little bit better from our first conversation with **Lita** about why cooling down and recovery is so important. If I don't take that time, there might be some repercussions later in the day. It might be why I'm not feeling so great or maybe I still feel like I'm I'm, you know, life is stressful. I might feel a little bit more stressed. You need to take that time to sort of bring your body back into a state of calm. Yeah. And then in terms of our conversation with Seth, I have wanted to get a pair of some of these massage balls because my mom, like I said, has shown me how to use a lot of these these techniques with a tennis ball, but I want to try it with a little bit of a firmer ball with the um
