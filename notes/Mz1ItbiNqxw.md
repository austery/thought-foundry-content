### 人工冰冻圈：冷链重塑的全球食物图景

想象一下地球上冰封的区域：高山冰川、西伯利亚的永久冻土、两极地区。这就是**冰冻圈**（Cryosphere: 地球上所有冰冻水的总称），是世界被冰封的部分。现在，再想象一下你的冰箱。它是一个白色的盒子，可能是不锈钢的，可能很乱，也可能很整洁，可能装满食物，也可能空空如也。但无论如何，它只是冰山一角。因为如果你生活在发达国家，你的冰箱就连接着一个完整的**热控网络**（Thermal Control Network: 用于维持特定温度的系统）。这个网络被称为**冷链**（Cold Chain: 从生产到消费过程中，为保持特定低温而连续进行的储存、运输和配送过程）。它负责将你所吃食物的近四分之三，从农场运送到你的餐桌。

冷链的规模是巨大的。将所有冷藏仓库、运输集装箱、卡车和超市陈列柜加起来，这个**人工冰冻圈**（Artificial Cryosphere: 由人类活动建立的、用于维持低温的系统）的体积超过7亿立方米。它就像一个新兴的北极。而且，与真正的北极不同，它正在迅速扩张，因为世界各地越来越多的人拥有了他们的第一台冰箱，并加入了冷链。

大约十多年前，我意识到，尽管我多年来一直在撰写和思考食物，但我从未踏足过我们为食物建立的这个庞大的人工冰冻圈。于是，我穿上保暖内衣，出发去探索。我发现，制冷（Refrigeration: 通过移除热量来降低和维持温度的技术）的本质并非仅仅是“冷”，而是为了**新鲜度**（Freshness: 食物保持其最佳品质和可食用状态的程度）。更重要的是，一旦拥有了冰箱，似乎所有食物问题都可以用“冷”来解决。

以牛油果为例。牛油果是一种热带水果，保质期短，深受许多牛油果树无法生长的地区人们的喜爱。牛油果之所以能远行数千英里，保持新鲜美味而非干瘪腐烂，全赖于制冷技术。一旦采摘，牛油果就像人类一样，生命有限，呼吸次数也有限。如果对其进行冷藏，它的呼吸就会减慢，从而延长其生命。是的，水果和蔬菜拥有的“抗衰老”技术比我们人类还要先进。

目前，如果你在阿姆斯特丹的超市购物，货架上的牛油果很可能来自肯尼亚。2010年至2020年间，肯尼亚的牛油果产量翻了两番。荷兰人消费牛油果的数量也大致在同一时期翻了两番。这两者并非毫无关联。更相关的是，牛油果与其他水果、蔬菜以及切花一起，如今已成为肯尼亚最大的海外收入来源，超越了咖啡、茶叶甚至旅游业。然而，大部分出口农产品来自少数几个大型农场，其中一些由跨国公司拥有，因为它们才拥有投资和维护昂贵制冷设备的资源。与此同时，牛油果极度缺水。在肯尼亚种植牛油果需要灌溉，而肯尼亚目前正面临水危机。

但也许你更愿意考虑或品尝新鲜的马鲁拉果（Marula fruit）。如果你不在撒哈拉以南非洲的夏季，那么你很难尝到它。据说它的味道融合了菠萝、芒果、荔枝和番石榴，听起来令人垂涎。我本人也非常想尝试一下，但马鲁拉果在美国的超市里却踪影难觅。它不易冷藏，因此无法像牛油果那样成为一种大宗商品。这是制冷带来的又一个后果。

是的，冷链意味着我们这些接入它的人可以全年享用新鲜农产品，但仅限于那些能够冷藏的水果和蔬菜。以上只是几个例子。全球各地所有易腐食品（Perishable Foods: 指容易变质、需要低温储存的食品）都有类似的故事。但我希望你开始看到一些显而易见却至今未被充分讨论的事实：制冷技术既有益处，也有其代价。

我们在19世纪末引入了机械制冷，旨在解决两个非常具体的问题：如何在夏季的美国生产拉格啤酒，以及——这是真的——如何将肉类运送到世界上第一批真正的大城市。制冷技术不仅解决了这些问题，还带来了更多。在拥有美式冷链的国家，人们现在可以食用数量空前（甚至对皇室而言也难以想象）的肉类和热带水果，而且价格低廉，这意味着几乎任何人都可以每天享用汉堡、啤酒（Bud）和香蕉。这无疑是奇迹，但它也伴随着权衡。

Picture Earth's icy places. Mountain glaciers, Siberian permafrost, the poles. This is the cryosphere, the frozen part of the world. Now picture your fridge. It's a white box, maybe stainless steel, maybe messy, maybe pristine, maybe full, maybe empty. Regardless, it is just the tip of the iceberg. Because if you live in the developed world, your fridge is connected to an entire network of thermal control. It's called the cold chain, and it brings nearly three quarters of everything you eat from the farm to your table. It's also massive. Add all those refrigerated warehouses, shipping containers, trucks, supermarket cabinets together, and this artificial cryosphere is more than 700 million cubic meters. It's a new Arctic. And unlike the real one, it's growing fast as people all around the world get their first fridge and join the cold chain themselves. A little more than a decade ago, I realized that even though I'd been writing about, thinking about food for years, I had never set foot inside this vast artificial cryosphere we'd built for our food to live in. So I put on my thermal underwear and set out to explore. And what I discovered is that refrigeration isn't really about cold. It's about freshness. But also, once you have a fridge, every food problem seems like it can be solved by cold. Take the avocado. The avocado is a tropical fruit. It has a short shelf life, and it is beloved in all kinds of places where an avocado tree would never grow. The avocado can only travel thousands of miles and remain fresh and delicious, rather than shriveled and rotten, because of refrigeration. Once it's harvested, an avocado, like a human, only has a certain number of breaths it can take before it dies. If you chill it, it breathes more slowly and so it lives longer. Yes, fruit and vegetables have better anti-aging tech than we do. Right now, if you go to a supermarket in Amsterdam, the avocados on the shelf are likely from Kenya. Kenyan production of avocados quadrupled between 2010 and 2020. The quantity of avocado eaten by Dutch people quadrupled during roughly the same time span. The two are not unrelated. What's also related, avocados, with other fruits and vegetables and together with cut flowers, are now Kenya's largest source of overseas revenue. They've overtaken coffee, tea, even tourism. But the majority of that export produce comes from just a few large farms, several of which are owned by multinational corporations because they are the ones that have the resources to install and maintain expensive refrigeration equipment. Meanwhile, the avocado is thirsty. It requires irrigation to grow in Kenya, and Kenya is currently in water crisis. But perhaps you'd rather think about or eat a fresh marula fruit. Well, if you're not in sub-Saharan Africa in the summer, good luck to you. People say it tastes like a combination of pineapple, mango, lychee and guava, which sounds amazing. I would like to try one myself very much, but the marula fruit doesn't show up in US supermarkets. It doesn’t refrigerate well, and so it can't be a commodity the way an avocado can. This is another consequence of refrigeration. Yes, the cold chain means that those of us that are connected to it can eat fresh produce all year round, but only those fruits and vegetables that can be refrigerated. So these are just a couple of examples. There are similar stories to be told about all perishable foods all over the globe, but I hope you're starting to see something that should be obvious, but hasn't really been part of the conversation until now, which is that refrigeration has costs as well as benefits. We implemented mechanical refrigeration in the late 1800s to solve two very specific problems: how to make lager beer in the US in summer and -- for real -- And how to get meat to people living in the world's first truly big cities. It has solved those problems and then some. In countries with a US-style cold chain, people can now eat meat and tropical fruit in quantities that would have been previously unimaginable, even for royalty, and at prices that mean that almost anyone can have a burger, a Bud and a banana every single day of the year. This is miraculous, but it has trade offs. And the biggest trade off of all is that cooling the artificial cryosphere is melting the natural one.

### 冷链的权衡：环境代价与创新未来

而所有权衡中最大的代价是：冷却我们的人工冰冻圈，正在融化自然的冰冻圈。用于制冷食物的化学品和能源，已经占到了全球总排放量的2.5%至3%。这仅仅是冷却食物，还不包括建筑、服务器农场或其他需要降温的设备。这个比例与全球航空业的排放量相当，甚至可能略高。而且，正如我所说，冷链正在快速增长。发展中国家希望建立冷链，这有充分的理由：它能帮助他们通过出口牛油果等作物赚钱，也能帮助他们减少食物浪费。

这确实在一定程度上是事实。制冷技术在减少农场到市场之间的浪费方面非常有效。在美国拥有冷链之前，其种植的30%的农产品在运抵市场前就会腐烂。如今，这些损失几乎为零。但猜猜怎么着？现在美国人丢弃了30%的已经运抵市场的商品。制冷只是转移了浪费发生的地方，并未消除它。至于出口，那是一场只能通过价格竞争来取胜的游戏，这意味着规模化，意味着少数几家由跨国公司控股的大型企业。与此同时，你已经耗尽了地下水，并用牛油果种植园取代了马鲁拉树。减少食物浪费和帮助小农户摆脱贫困是重要的目标，但建立美式冷链可能不是实现这些目标的最佳途径。

更重要的是，如果我们为当今地球上的每个人建立一个美式冷链，制冷产生的排放量将增加五倍，届时将与整个美国的排放量相当。换句话说，这是一个难以想象的巨大数字。

好了，这就是“末日悲观”的部分。这是一场危机，但同时也是一个机遇，因为大部分冷链尚未建成。现在是时候重新思考我们与制冷的关系了。就像发展中国家跳过了固定电话和支票簿，直接采用了手机和数字银行一样，它们在食物保鲜方面也可以做得更好。然后，我们发达国家（developed countries）可以向它们学习，重塑我们自己的食物系统。

这可能是什么样子呢？首先，我们可以改变制冷的方式。举个例子：如果你扰动某些材料中的分子（特别是原子），它们会从周围环境中吸收热能来重组自身。Bingo！你就创造了一个冰箱。科学家们已经有了一个**非常酷**（此处双关，意指“制冷”和“棒极了”）的原型。它通过挤压和释放一种廉价且常见的塑料来工作，其产生的制冷效果与老式冰箱相当，但排放量却不到一半。因此，改变制冷方式可以减少排放。这是一种解决方案，但并非唯一解决方案。

最终，我们必须思考我们的目标。我们希望啤酒是冰冷的，但对于大多数食物来说，真正的目标是新鲜度。那么，如果我们能在不依赖冷的情况下实现新鲜度呢？好消息是，你已经可以买到经过喷涂的食用脂肪基粉末的水果。这种粉末形成一种纳米级涂层，能在室温下保持农产品的新鲜度，其效果几乎与冰箱冷藏一样持久。想象一下，非洲的小农户能够使用喷雾瓶而不是耗能巨大的冰箱来保存他们的收成。

还有一项正在商业开发中的新工艺，它使用**超临界二氧化碳**（Supercritical Carbon Dioxide: 在临界温度和压力以上，物质呈现出介于气体和液体之间状态的流体），可以将肉类在室温下保存六个月以上。或者，如果你说，制冷通过延长易腐食品的运输时间来压缩了地理距离，那么为什么不加快运输速度呢？目前，美国最大的连锁超市正在阿肯色州通过无人机运送未冷藏的鸡肉和冰淇淋，这使得冷藏卡车和超市冷藏货架不再是必需品。

即使在厨房里，人们也在努力让食物摆脱冰箱的束缚。许多水果和蔬菜在稍温暖、更湿润的环境下，味道反而更好，营养更丰富，保质期也更长。那么，为什么不缩小冰箱的体积，并重新设计我们的家来适应这一点呢？

需要明确的是，我并非反对冰箱。我爱我的冰箱。制冷技术在任何未来的食物系统中都扮演着重要角色。但让我们像对待汽车一样来处理它。如今，我们知道可以实现汽车的电气化，可以将它们从市中心移除，在某些情况下，甚至可以用自行车和更好的公共交通来完全替代它们。这些可以成为实现我们出行目标、可持续性目标以及生活质量目标的更好方式。

所以，让我们以同样的方式来思考食物保鲜问题：仅在制冷是正确解决方案时使用它，同时重新设计我们的冰箱，使其更具可持续性。也许这样，我们就能拯救地球，修复我们的食物系统，并让生活更加美味。谢谢大家。

And the biggest trade off of all is that cooling the artificial cryosphere is melting the natural one. The chemicals and energy used to refrigerate food already account for between 2.5 and three percent of all global emissions. That's just cooling food, not buildings or server farms or any of the other things we keep cool. That's the same as, maybe even a little more, than global aviation. And like I said, the cold chain is growing fast. Developing countries want a cold chain for good reasons, because it will help them make money exporting crops like avocados, and because it will help them reduce food waste. That's true, but only partially. Refrigeration is really effective at reducing waste between the farm and the market. Before the US had a cold chain, 30 percent of everything it grew rotted before it made it to market. Today, those losses have shrunk almost to nothing. But guess what? Now Americans throw away 30 percent of everything that makes it to market. Refrigeration moved where the waste takes place. It didn't eliminate it. And as for exports, that's a game you only win by competing on price, which means scale, which means a few large firms owned by multinationals. Meanwhile, you've drained your aquifers and replaced your marula trees with avocado plantations. Reducing food waste and lifting smallholders out of poverty are important goals. Building a US-style cold chain might not be the best way to achieve them. What's more, if we build a US-style cold chain for everyone alive today, the emissions from refrigeration will multiply by five, at which point they'll be the same size as the entire US emissions. In other words, unimaginably huge. OK, so that's the doom-and-gloom part. This is a crisis, but it's also an opportunity because most of that cold chain hasn't been built yet. This is the moment to rethink our relationship with refrigeration. And just like developing countries skipped landlines and checkbooks in favor of cell phones and digital banking, they can do better when it comes to food preservation. And then we in developed countries can learn from them to remake our own food systems. What might this look like? Well, for one, we can change how we refrigerate. One example. If you disturb the molecules, the atoms in particular types of materials, they will suck in heat energy from their surroundings to reorganize themselves. Bingo! You've created a fridge. Scientists have a super cool -- pun intended -- prototype. It works by squeezing and releasing a cheap and common form of plastic, and it produces the same amount of cooling for less than half the emissions of an old-school fridge. So changing how we refrigerate can reduce emissions. It is a solution. It is not the solution. Ultimately, we have to think about our goals. We want our beer cold, but for most food, the real goal is freshness. So what if we could achieve freshness without cold? Good news, already you can buy fruit that has been sprayed with an edible fat-based powder that forms a nanoscale coating that keeps produce fresh at room temperature for nearly as long as the fridge keeps it in the cold. So imagine a smallholder farmer in Africa being able to preserve their harvest using a spray bottle rather than a power-hungry fridge. There’s also a new process in commercial development that uses supercritical carbon dioxide to keep meat good at room temperature for six months-plus. Or if you say, well, refrigeration compressed geography by expanding perishable foods' travel time, well, why not speed up travel? Right now, America's largest grocery is delivering unrefrigerated chicken and ice cream by drone, in Arkansas, taking refrigerated trucks off the street and refrigerated supermarket shelves out of the equation. Even in the kitchen, people are working to liberate food from the fridge. Many fruits and vegetables actually taste better, have more nutrients, and last longer in slightly warmer, more humid conditions. So why not shrink our fridges and redesign our homes to allow that? Just to be clear, I am not anti-fridge. I love my fridge. Refrigeration has an important role to play in any future food system. But let's approach it a bit more like we do cars. These days we know we can electrify them and we can remove them from our city centers and we can replace them in some situations, replace them altogether with bikes and better public transit. And these can be better ways to achieve both our mobility goals and our sustainability and quality of life goals. So let's think like that about preserving freshness, using refrigeration only when it's the right solution, while also redesigning our fridges to make them more sustainable. And maybe we can save the planet, fix our food system and make life more delicious. Thank you.
