### 格陵兰威胁

**Tracy Mumford**: 来自《纽约时报》，这是今日头条。我是 Tracy Mumford。今天是星期一，1月19日。我们今天报道的内容有：

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Monday, January 19th. Here's what we're covering.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: **总统特朗普**竞选让**格陵兰**成为美国一部分的行动在本周末升级，他威胁要对不与他合作的欧洲国家征收关税。他宣布将从2月起对包括英国、法国和德国在内的一些美国最亲密的盟友征收10%的关税，并表示将在6月将其提高到25%，他引述道：“直到达成一项完全、彻底购买格陵兰的协议为止。” 他针对的国家都是北约成员国，它们在特朗普一再要求丹麦放弃对格陵兰的控制时，都表达了与丹麦的团结。他们称关税威胁是恐吓，是不可接受的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: President Trump's campaign to make Greenland part of the United States escalated this weekend as he threatened to slap tariffs on European nations that don't cooperate with him. He announced he would hit some of the US's closest allies, including Britain, France, and Germany, with a 10% tariff starting in February, and he said he'd ramp it up to 25% in June, quote, "until such time as a deal is reached for the complete and total purchase of Greenland." The countries he targeted are all NATO members that have expressed solidarity with Denmark in the face of Trump's repeated demands that it should give up control of Greenland. They called the tariff threat intimidation and unacceptable.

</details>

**Reporter 1**: 我们看到，一旦发生这种情况，就立即展开了寻找解决方案的努力。欧洲领导人之间进行了双边通话。欧洲领导人与美国总统进行了通话。你知道，我认为这只是引起了一片恐慌性的哗然，我们看到来自欧盟各国的**大使**周日晚上在布鲁塞尔举行紧急会议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter 1**: What we saw as soon as it happened was just an absolute scramble to find a solution. There were bilateral calls between European leaders. There were calls between European leaders and the president of the United States. You know, I think it was just an absolutely panicked uproar coming out of this and we saw the ambassadors from across the European Union nations meet in Brussels on Sunday night for an emergency meeting.

</details>

**Reporter 2**: 我的同事 Gina Smileik 报道欧盟事务。她说，欧盟可能会使用一个它从未用过的严厉工具进行报复，该工具正式名称为“**反胁迫工具**”。非正式地，它被称为“欧洲贸易大炮”，可以用来对大型**美国科技公司**或其他在欧洲有大量业务的**公司**施加限制。Gina 说，一些官员，包括法国总统，都建议是时候使用它了。但目前，欧盟更倾向于谈判而非报复。因此，欧洲人有充分的理由希望解决这个问题，那就是他们**极其依赖美国**的军事能力，尤其是在**北约防御**和**乌克兰战争**方面。他们在技术和支持方面都依赖美国。他们理想中的做法是避免美欧之间出现更深的裂痕，因为那将带来严重的后果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter 2**: My colleague Gina Smileik covers the EU. She says that the block could retaliate with a drastic tool it's never used before, officially called the anti-coercion instrument. Unofficially, it's called Europe's trade bazooka, and it could be used to slap restrictions on big American tech companies or other corporations that do a lot of business in Europe. Gina says that some officials, including the president of France, have suggested it's time to use it. But for now, the EU is leaning more toward negotiation than retaliation. So, the Europeans have a good reason to want to talk this out, which is that they are extremely dependent on the United States for military capabilities, especially when it comes to NATO defenses and the war in Ukraine. They're relying on America for a lot of technology and a lot of support. They would ideally like to resolve this without a deeper rupture between the US and Europe because that would have serious consequences here.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 特朗普总统一再表示，美国需要格陵兰是为了**国家安全**，以对抗俄罗斯和中国在北极的利益。过去，美国在该岛上曾有大量的军事存在。冷战后，它关闭了许多设施，但美国有权重新开放格陵兰的约16个基地。然而，特朗普坚持认为这还不够，他说拥有权很重要。他引述：“因为我认为这在心理上是成功所必需的。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: President Trump has repeatedly said the US needs Greenland for national security purposes to push back against Russian and Chinese interests in the Arctic. In the past, the US did have a large military presence on the island. It closed a lot of its facilities there after the Cold War, but the US has the right to reopen about 16 bases in Greenland. Trump, however, has insisted that's not enough, saying ownership was important. Quote, "Because that is what I feel is psychologically needed for success."

### 明尼苏达抗议

**Tracy Mumford**: 在明尼苏达州，一名联邦法官已命令**ICE**特工停止对**抗议者**使用过度武力。她的裁决概述了一系列不当行为模式，以及在12月事件中，甚至在**Renee Good**被**致命枪击**导致紧张局势升级之前，警官是如何应对的。在此案中，原告描述了他们如何在未被警告的情况下被胡椒喷雾击中，并被ICE特工包围，后者近距离用**半自动武器**指着他们。一名女子描述了她如何被按倒在雪地上，然后被带到一个联邦大楼，在那里她的一些衣服被脱掉，她的**结婚戒指**被剪掉，她被戴上手铐。她被告知将以**妨碍公务**罪起诉，但最终没有提起任何指控。一位法律学者说，这种行为让人联想到20世纪60年代初警察攻击**民权抗议者**的情景。一位**犯罪学教授**告诉《泰晤士报》，在他45年研究使用武力的经历中，他引述道：“我从未见过我们今天所经历的这种情况。” 在她的裁决中，这位由**拜登总统**任命的法官写道，特工的行为对**第一修正案**权利产生了寒蝉效应，并命令他们不得报复示威者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: In Minnesota, a federal judge has ordered ICE agents to stop using excessive force against protesters. Her ruling outlined a pattern of misconduct and how officers responded to incidents in December, even before tensions escalated after the fatal shooting of Renee Good. In the case, plaintiffs described how they were hit with pepper spray without warning, and surrounded by ICE agents pointing semi-automatic weapons at them at close range. One woman described how she was put face down in the snow and then taken to a federal building where some of her clothes were removed, her wedding ring was cut off, and she was shackled. She was told she'd be charged with obstructing an officer, but no charges were filed. One legal scholar said the behavior evoked how police attacked civil rights protesters in the early 1960s. and a professor of criminology told the Times that in his 45 years of studying use of force, quote, "I've seen nothing like what we're experiencing today." In her ruling, the judge, who was appointed by President Biden, wrote that the agents actions have had a chilling effect on First Amendment rights and ordered them not to retaliate against demonstrators.

</details>

**Reporter 3**: 那项联邦命令有点荒谬，因为那位联邦法官下来告诉我们，我们不能做我们本就不在做的事情。**国土安全部部长 Christy Gnome**昨天在CBS上为特工的行为辩护。她否认了法庭案件中所描述的胡椒喷雾事件正在发生，即使在她被展示一段支持这些说法的视频时也是如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter 3**: That federal order was um a little ridiculous because that federal judge came down and told us we couldn't do what we already aren't doing. Christy Gnome, the Secretary of Homeland Security, defended the agents behavior on CBS yesterday. She denied that pepper spray incidents like the ones described in the court case were happening, even as she was shown a video backing up those accounts.

</details>

**Christy Gnome**: 化学制剂的使用任何时候...

**Reporter 3**: ...只有在发生暴力事件并持续下去时，我们才会使用这些化学制剂，而且你需要能够建立法律和秩序来确保人们的安全。那才是唯一的情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Christy Gnome**: Chemical agents being used any

**Reporter 3**: >> we only use those chemical agents when there's violence happening and perpetuating and you need to be able to establish law in order to keep people safe. That's the only situation.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 与此同时，**五角大楼**已通知1,500名**现役部队**准备可能部署到明尼苏达州，此前特朗普总统威胁要援引《**叛乱法**》。国防部官员告诉《泰晤士报》，这些部队属于驻扎在阿拉斯加的一支陆军空降师。上周，五角大楼还悄悄通知了200名**德州国民警卫队**部队做好部署准备。公开表示，特朗普似乎已经放弃了他最初使用该法案派遣军队的威胁，周五告诉记者，他引述道：“我认为我现在不需要它。” 一位五角大楼官员承认了这一语气上的转变，但表示军方仍希望做好准备。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Meanwhile, the Pentagon has told 1,500 active duty troops to prepare for a possible deployment to Minnesota after President Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act there. Defense Department officials tell the Times the troops are part of an Army Airborne Division based in Alaska. Last week, the Pentagon also quietly alerted 200 Texas National Guard troops to be ready to deploy. publicly. Trump has already appeared to back off from his initial threat to use the act to send in troops, telling reporters on Friday that quote, "I don't think I need it right now." One Pentagon official acknowledged that change of tone, but said the military still wants to be prepared.

</details>

### 和平委员会

**Tracy Mumford**: 最后是关于特朗普政府的最新消息。总统计划创建一个**国际和平委员会**的细节已经浮出水面。他最初提出的想法是成立一个由世界领导人组成的团体，负责监督**加沙**的重建。现在看来，它的范围要大得多，可能涵盖其他冲突。而且加入需要巨额费用。根据《泰晤士报》审阅的一份草案章程，特朗普希望以**10亿美元**的价格出售该委员会的永久席位。几个国家表示已收到邀请，包括阿根廷、加拿大和土耳其，但尚不清楚是否有任何国家同意加入。白宫表示，该委员会将包括特朗普的**女婿贾里德·库什纳**、**国务卿马可·卢比奥**以及**世界银行**行长**阿伊·邦加**等人。总统在社交媒体上称其为“有史以来、任何地方、任何时间组建的最伟大、最负盛名的委员会。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And last update on the Trump administration. New details have emerged about the president's plan to create an international board of peace. He had originally floated the idea as a group of world leaders who would oversee the rebuilding of Gaza. Now it seems to have a much bigger scope that could stretch to cover other conflicts. And there's a huge fee to join. Under a draft charter reviewed by the Times, Trump is hoping to sell permanent seats on the board for a billion dollars each. Several countries said they had received invitations, including Argentina, Canada, and Turkey, though it's unclear if any have agreed to join. The White House said the board would include, among others, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, the Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Aay Banga, the head of the World Bank. In a social media post, the president called it quote, "The greatest and most prestigious board ever assembled at any time, any place."

### 中国人口危机

**Tracy Mumford**: 在**中国**，今天公布的新数据显示，该国正面临一场**人口危机**。**出生率**已跌至**历史低点**。并且连续第四年，死亡人数多于出生人数，导致该国人口规模缩小且老龄化。中国多年来一直知道这个问题，并采取了许多措施试图扭转这一趋势，但目前看来都无效。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: In China, new data out today shows that the country is facing a demographic crisis. The birth rate has plunged to a record low. And for the fourth year in a row, there have been more deaths than births, leaving the country's population smaller and older. China's known about this problem for years, and it's done a host of things to try to reverse the trend, but nothing is working at this point.

</details>

**Reporter 4**: 《泰晤士报》上海分社社长**Alexander Stevenson**说，该国十年前放宽了臭名昭著的**一孩政策**，现在正使用各种策略鼓励人们生育两个甚至三个孩子。因此，官员们提供了生育二胎和三胎的现金奖励。他们承诺提供**补贴住房**。他们甚至采取了更具侵入性的措施，比如派遣地方官员去了解新婚夫妇的家庭计划。一项最近的政策变化，虽然并非旨在提高出生率，但被广泛解读为是这样——即决定开始对**避孕套**和**避孕**征税。可以说，这是一种全面的推动，甚至最高领导人“Cining”也称生育是“**爱国行为**”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter 4**: Alexander Stevenson is the time Shanghai bureau chief. She says the country relaxed its infamous one child policy a decade ago and is now using a whole bunch of tactics to encourage people to have two even three children. So officials have offered cash for second and third children. They've promised subsidized housing. They've done even more invasive things like dispatched local officials to find out the family planning of recent married couples. One recent policy change which wasn't explicitly aimed at boosting the birth rate but was widely interpreted that way was a decision to start taxing condoms and contraception. It's kind of like across the board there's been an allout push basically and even the top leader Cining has called it a patriotic act to have a baby.

</details>

**Reporter 4**: 就为什么年轻人不生孩子而言，我们采访了很多人，他们表达了对经济的担忧。许多年轻人现在从事**零工经济**，这意味着他们是送快递或送餐的，而且这不是一个稳定或持续的收入或生活方式。然后，对于年轻女性来说，有一种感觉是，如果你结婚生子，你就会失去所有的独立性，因为社会上仍然存在一种期望，即女性要操持家务。所以，这确实是文化和经济因素共同作用的结果，这些因素正在影响着当今中国许多年轻人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter 4**: In terms of why young people aren't having kids, we've been talking to a lot of people who express a sense of unease about the economy. Many young people now are in the gig economy, which means that they are delivering packages or delivering food and it's not a consistent or steady income or lifestyle. And then for younger women, there is this sense that if you get married and you have a kid, you will lose all of your independence because there's this expectation still within society in China that women run the household. So, it's really a combination of both cultural and economic factors that are weighing on a lot of young people today in China.

### 烟囱清扫

**Tracy Mumford**: 最后，**烟囱清扫工**就像幸运儿一样幸运。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And finally,

chimney sweep is as lucky as lucky can be.

</details>

**Reporter 5**: 也许是世界上最著名的烟囱清扫工是**迪克·范·戴克**在《**欢乐满人间**》中扮演的角色。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter 5**: Potentially the world's most famous chimney sweep is the one Dick Van Dyke played in Mary Poppins.

</details>

**Reporter 5**: 哦，给我飞吻一个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter 5**: Oh, blow me a kiss.

</details>

**Reporter 5**: 那也很幸运。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter 5**: And that's lucky, too.

</details>

**Reporter 5**: 在那部电影里，他说的口音糟透了，以至于他后来实际上向英国人民道歉了。人们可能不太愉快地想起的另一类烟囱清扫工是18世纪和19世纪被派去清理烟囱通道的**小孩子**。很容易认为烟囱清扫工已经成为过去。随着**中央供暖**变得流行，这个行业肯定萎缩了，但并未完全消失。而在**伦敦**，它现在正在卷土重来。根据**全国烟囱清扫协会**的数据，需求正在上升。这很可能是由于**高能源价格**以及**烧木柴的炉灶**重新流行起来，尽管科学家们说室内火灾可能带来健康风险。在某些情况下，人们正在重新开放他们可能被封锁了一代的壁炉，需要进行清洁。为了做到这一点，清扫工正在使用明显现代化的技术，比如将**摄像头**伸入烟囱内部，或使用**工业吸尘器**来清除烟灰和碎片。有些甚至有**无人机**在头顶盘旋来检查屋顶的状况。鉴于所有这些更新，烟囱清扫协会主席表示，称他们为“**烟囱技术员**”可能更贴切。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Reporter 5**: In which he did an accent that was so bad he actually apologized to the British people for it later. The other chimney sweeps people may think of less cheerfully are the small children who were put to work cleaning out the flu in the 18th and 19th centuries. It's easy to think of chimney sweeps as a thing of the past. After central heating became all the rage, the profession definitely shrank, but it didn't disappear entirely. And in London, it's now making a comeback. According to the National Association of Chimney Sweeps, demand is rising. It's likely a combination of high energy prices and the renewed popularity of wood burning stoves, even though scientists say indoor fires can come with health risks. In some cases, people are reopening their fireplaces that may have been blocked off a generation before, and they need to be cleaned. To do it, the sweeps are using decidedly modern techniques like sending cameras up the chimneys interior or using industrial vacuum cleaners to remove the soot and debris. Some even have drones buzzing overhead to check the state of the roof. Given all the updates, the president of the Chimney Sweep Association said it might be more apt to call them chimney technicians.
