### 条约失效与核军备控制

**主持人**: **乔治·佩尔科维奇**是卡内基国际和平基金会核政策项目的资深研究员。**马特·科尔达**是美国科学家联合会核信息项目的副主任，**珍妮丝·斯坦**是多伦多大学冲突管理教授，也是多伦多大学全球事务蒙克学院的创始主任。欢迎三位来到本期节目。很高兴有你们在。我想先从乔治开始。**新《削减战略武器条约》**涵盖了哪些内容，为什么它在今年二月到期了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: George Perkovich is a senior fellow in the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace nuclear policy program. Matt Korda is the associate director for the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, and Janice Stein is the Belzberg Professor of Conflict Management at the University of Toronto and the founding director of U of T's Munk School of Global Affairs. Welcome all three of you to the rundown. Great to have you here. I want to start off with George. What did the new START treaty cover and why was it allowed to expire in February of this year?

</details>

**乔治·佩尔科维奇**: 嗯，这项条约，就像它的前身一样，涵盖了你可以想象到的远程核武器。它们被称为**战略核武器**。但基本上，这些是美国和俄罗斯拥有的、能够打击对方本土的核武器。好的。它限制了这些武器的发射器数量。所以有多少导弹，多少轰炸机可以携带这些武器？然后根据计数规则，它将它们限制在每方 1550 枚。它在两周前到期，部分原因是双方在军备控制方面耗尽了精力，也因为乌克兰战争，所以在乌克兰战争期间，他们未能就延期达成一致。美国一直坚持认为，因为中国正在迅速发展其核力量，中国应该被纳入任何未来的战略军备控制协议。还有，我想说的最后一件事是，新的《削减战略武器条约》，就像它的前身一样，并没有涵盖所谓的**战术或短程战场核武器**。鉴于俄罗斯可能在欧洲拥有 2000 件此类武器，政府和其他方面表示，这些武器现在应该被纳入未来。这非常难以做到。所以没有达成协议。一切都因此瓦解了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**George Perkovich**: Well, the treaty, like its predecessors, covered what you could think of as long range nuclear weapons. They're called strategic nuclear weapons. But basically, these are the nuclear weapons that the United States and Russia have, which can hit each other's homeland. All right. And it limited the number of the launchers of those weapons. So how many missiles, how many bomber planes could carry those weapons? And then by the counting rules, it limited them to 1550 each. It expired two weeks ago, in part because both sides ran out of gas on arms control and also the Ukraine war, so they weren't able, during the Ukraine war to agree to extend it. The United States has been insisting with some reason that because China is rapidly building up its nuclear forces, China should be brought into any future strategic arms control agreement. And also, last thing I'd say is that the new START treaty, like its predecessors, did not cover what are called tactical or short range battlefield nuclear weapons. And since Russia has perhaps 2000 of those in Europe, the administration and others were saying those weapons should now be included in the future. That's very hard to do. And so there was no agreement. So everything just lapsed.

</details>

### 剩余条约的安全性

**主持人**: 珍妮丝，剩余的核相关条约有多安全？我们有 1970 年的**《不扩散条约》**，1996 年的**《全面禁止核试验条约》**。这些会像《新削减战略武器条约》一样失效吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Janice, how safe are the remaining nuclear related treaties? You know, namely, we've got the 1970 Non-Proliferation treaty, the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Could these fall to the wayside?

</details>

**珍妮丝·斯坦**: 嗯，正如乔治刚才所说，中国核计划引起了很多担忧，我们称之为**“三体问题”**。用最少的数量来模拟生存下来，能够承受第一次打击并有足够的力量进行报复，这是很容易的。这一直是任何核稳定性的基础。用两个人来建模比用三个人更容易。如果你想到这一点，那是因为你进入了动态模型：嗯，如果这两个人针对那一个人采取行动会发生什么？这坦率地说会造成各种困境。所以《禁止核试验条约》存在漏洞。乔治，我不知道还能如何描述，从现任政府来看，中国进行了一次地下核试验，没有通知，而且它在测试一项先进技术。如果发生全面核军备竞赛，核禁试条约将非常、非常难以维持。毫无疑问。毫无疑问，《不扩散条约》正处于危险之中，不是因为中国、俄罗斯和美国在互相做什么，而是因为他们各自在其邻国做什么。对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janice Stein**: Well, as George was just saying, there is a lot of concern about China's nuclear program, and we call that the three body problem. It's easy, easier to model with the minimum you need to to survive a first strike and have enough to retaliate. That's been the underpinning of whatever nuclear stability we have. It's easier to do that modelling with two than it is with three. And if you just think about that, that's because you get into the dynamics of, well, what happens if these two apply against that one? And that creates all kinds of dilemmas, frankly. So the test ban treaty, there are leaks. I would say, George, I don't know how else to describe it from the current government that China conducted an underground nuclear test without notifying and that it was testing an advanced technology. If there is an all out nuclear arms race, a nuclear test ban will be very, very difficult to maintain over time. There's no question. There's no question the Non-Proliferation treaty is at risk, not because of what China and Russia and the United States are doing to each other, but because of what each of them is doing in their neighborhoods. Right.

### 核武库与军备竞赛

**主持人**: 好的。让我们来看看世界各核武器国家的武器库存，根据美国科学家联合会的数据。所以这是一张条形图。你会看到蓝色代表储备，橙色代表已部署的战略武器。现在俄罗斯的总估计是 4309 枚。美国 3600 枚，中国 600 枚，法国 290 枚。英国 225 枚，印度 180 枚，巴基斯坦 170 枚，以色列 90 枚，朝鲜 50 枚。马特。这些国家中哪些对核不扩散感兴趣，哪些最有可能增加其军火库并可能开发新技术？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. With that being said, let's have a look at the weapons inventories of the world's nuclear armed nations, according to the Federation of American Scientists. So this is a bar graph here. You will see in blue reserve and in orange ochre colour deployed strategic. Now these are the total estimates Russia with 4309. The US with 3600, China with 600, France with 290. The UK 225, India 180, Pakistan 170, Israel with 90 and North Korea with 50. Matt. Which of these nations are interested in nuclear non-proliferation and which are most likely to say, increase their arsenal and develop perhaps new technologies?

</details>

**马特·科尔达**: 是的。你知道，重要的是要认识到，美国和俄罗斯拥有世界上大约 90% 的核武器，但这个比例正在缩小。这并不是因为这些库存正在变小，而是因为相反的情况。对。其他国家正在增加它们的库存，因此它们构成了更大比例的整体核蛋糕。所以你提到了中国、英国、法国、印度、巴基斯坦等国家，这些国家中的许多都在增加它们库存中的核武器数量。其他国家正在增加这些武器系统的技术能力，还有些国家两者都在做。实际上没有哪个核武器国家正在进行或接近裁军进程。我们实际上看到的是，所有这些国家都在进行极其昂贵和广泛的现代化改造活动，旨在真正将核武器保留在它们的军火库中，你知道，未来 50、60、70 年，实际上可能是一生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Matt Korda**: Yeah. You know, what's important to recognize is that the United States and Russia have about 90% of all nuclear weapons in the world, but that percentage is shrinking. And it's not because those stockpiles are getting any smaller, but it's actually because of the opposite. Right. Other countries are building up their stockpiles, and so they're constituting a larger portion of that sort of overall nuclear pie. And so you mentioned countries like China, the UK, France, India, Pakistan, many of these countries are increasing the numbers of nuclear weapons that they have in their stockpiles. Others are increasing sort of the the technological capabilities of those weapon systems and others are doing both. There is really no nuclear armed country that is in the process or anywhere close really, to the process of disarmament. Really what we're looking at is that all these countries are, are embarking on these incredibly expensive and extensive modernization campaigns that are designed to really keep nuclear weapons in their arsenals for the next, you know, 50, 60, 70 years, really probably for the for the remainder of our lifetimes.

</details>

**主持人**: 乔治，我希望你能补充一下。你能告诉我们一些关于新技术的情况吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: George, I'm hoping you can add on to that. What can you tell us a bit about some of the new technologies?

</details>

**乔治·佩尔科维奇**: 嗯，马特说得很好，所以俄罗斯，例如，有五种新的武器交付系统，能够打击到美国。它这样做是为了能够绕过美国可能部署的任何导弹防御系统来拦截这些武器。有一个巨大的鱼雷，可以一直潜入水下到达美国海岸，并引爆一个巨大的核弹头。有一种核动力巡航导弹，巡航导弹。你可以引导和机动，所以你可以让它们更难被拦截。俄罗斯正在建造一种由小型核反应堆驱动的，这样它就可以几乎无限期地停留在空中。还有其他几种，都设计用于绕过导弹防御。因为美国退出了可以说是最重要的条约，即 1972 年的**《反弹道导弹条约》**。2002 年，美国退出了该条约，然后俄罗斯表示，好吧，我们将找到一种方法来应对你对导弹防御所做的一切。中国正在显著增加其远程武器的数量以及这些武器的技术复杂性。据信他们没有解释，但他们应该解释，但据信这样做是为了确保它能够击败任何美国导弹防御，并且还能在某种攻击、美国对这个较小的中国部队的进攻性首次打击中幸存下来。所以这是两者。朝鲜也在做类似的事情，试图拥有能够可靠打击美国的导弹，以阻止美国首先攻击朝鲜。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**George Perkovich**: Well, the Matt said it well, so Russia, for example, has five new delivery systems of weapons to be able to hit as far as the United States. And it's doing that to be able to bypass any possible missile defenses that the US might put up to intercept those weapons. So there's a giant torpedo that could go underwater all the way to the coast of the United States and blow up a massive nuclear warhead. There is a nuclear powered cruise missile, cruise missiles. You can guide and manoeuvre, so you can make it much harder to intercept them. Russia is building one powered by a small nuclear reactor so that it could stay in the air almost indefinitely. There are several others, all designed to bypass missile defence. Because the US withdrew from the most important treaty, arguably, which was the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. In 2002, the US withdrew from that, and Russia then said, all right, we'll find a way to work around whatever you do on missile defence. China is adding the number significantly of its long range weapons and also the technical sophistication of those. And it's also believed they don't explain and they should explain, but it's believed that two is to be able to ensure it could beat any US missile defence and also survive any kind of offensive attack, offensive first strike by the US against this smaller Chinese force. And so that's those two. And North Korea is doing something similar, trying to have missiles that could reliably hit the United States to deter the United States from hitting North Korea first.

</details>

**主持人**: 马特，非常快速地，我想跟进。美国的**“金穹”**导弹防御提案会如何被潜在的核对手回应？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Matt, very quickly, I want to follow up. How would the US's Golden Dome missile proposal be met by potential nuclear rivals?

</details>

**马特·科尔达**: 是的。所以，你知道，正如乔治所提到的，我们有一种蓝图，说明一个国家将如何应对一个核武装国家建立的真正复杂的导弹防御体系。所以在 2002 年，美国退出了《反弹道导弹条约》。当时，包括俄罗斯和中国在内的几个国家都表示担忧，他们回应说，你知道，如果，如果，如果导弹防御和核威慑，对吧？如果这两件事是我们核稳定性的核心，对吧？没有防御，并具有某种相互脆弱性。如果你剥夺了导弹防御的这一方面，那么我们将不得不做出回应。对？因此，如果各国开始建立它们的防御，其他国家将不得不建立专门用于规避这些防御的系统。建造武器系统需要很长时间。但是如果你快进，你知道，十年、十五年后，这就是为什么我们看到俄罗斯、中国和其他国家开始建立这些专门设计用于抵消它们认为另一个国家通过部署先进导弹防御而获得的任何优势的系统。这并不是这些国家制造这些东西的唯一原因。还有很多国内原因，你知道，金钱原因，诸如此类。但先进导弹防御的发展无疑是一个重要的因素。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Matt Korda**: Yeah. So, you know, as as George mentioned, we sort of have a blueprint for how a country is going to respond to a really complex missile defence architecture that gets instituted by a nuclear armed state. So in 2002, the United States pulled out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. And at the time, there was a lot of concern from several countries, including Russia and China, where they kind of responded and they said, you know, if, if, if missile defence and nuclear deterrence, right? If these two things are sort of at the core of what we consider to be nuclear stability, right? Not having defences and having this sort of mutual vulnerability. And if you take away that aspect of missile defence, then we're going to have to respond. Right? And so if countries start building up their defences, other countries are going to have to build systems that are designed specifically to circumvent those defences. And so, you know, it takes a long time to build up a weapon system. But if you fast forward, you know, ten, 15 years later, this is why we're seeing Russia and China and other countries to start to build up these systems that are specifically designed to offset any perceived advantage that they can see another country getting by deploying advanced missile defences. Right. That's not the only reason why those countries are building those things. There's a whole host of other factors domestic reasons, you know, monetary reasons, things like that. But the the development of advanced missile defences is certainly a big one.

</details>

**主持人**: 珍妮丝，加拿大几十年来一直倡导和平利用核武器和技术。加拿大是 50 年前《不扩散条约》的首批签署国之一。我很好奇，加拿大参与“金穹”提案是否会破坏它所有的遗产工作？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Janice, Canada has spent decades advocating for the peaceful use of nuclear weapons and technology. Canada was one of the first signatories to the Non-Proliferation treaty 50 years ago. I am curious, would Canada's participation in the Golden Dome proposal undermine all that work in its legacy?

</details>

**珍妮丝·斯坦**: 会破坏《不扩散条约》吗？不会，因为我们不会成为扩散者。对。问题实际上是，正如马特和乔治所说，在某种程度上，你提高了导弹防御能力，即来袭导弹的防御能力，你实际上会激励各国开发越来越强大的导弹。这也是事实，尽管弹道导弹防御，正如刚才所说，不仅针对其他核大国，它还针对那些拥有非常复杂的弹道导弹技术和高超音速导弹技术（非核的）的国家。所以，从技术上讲，我们对“金穹”的了解还不够。坦率地说，规格还没有真正认真地提供。我看到你在那里笑了。但按照目前的描述，我们不会在形式上违反。它是否明智，那是完全另一回事，但我们不会在形式上违反。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janice Stein**: Would it undermine the Non-Proliferation treaty? No, because we would not be a proliferator. Right. The the issue really is as as Matt and George have said, that to the extent that you improve defence against missiles, incoming missiles, you actually incentivize powers to develop more and more powerful missiles. It is also true, though, that ballistic missile defence, as not just said, is not only aimed at other nuclear powers, it is aimed at states that are increasingly the owners of very sophisticated ballistic missile technology and hypersonic missile technology, which non-nuclear. So, technically speaking, and we don't know enough about the Golden Dome yet. Frankly, the specs are not there in a really serious way. And I see your smiling there. But as it is currently described, we would not be a violator from that perspective. Whether it's wise, that's a wholly different discussion, but we would not formally be a violent.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的，乔治。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right, George.

</details>

**乔治·佩尔科维奇**: 嗯，我认为珍妮丝是对的。我的意思是，我认为从《不扩散条约》的角度来看，导弹防御并不是一个如此关键的问题。除非，正如她所说，它促使人们发展而不是减少他们的核力量，我认为更大的问题是，如果加拿大或其他美国盟友开始开发选项来制造核武器，而不是导弹防御，而是核武器，那将是对《不扩散条约》的巨大挑战。而且，有时会在韩国、波兰或加拿大讨论，因为美国在这方面变得不可靠，人们可能需要对冲他们的赌注。所以这是对《不扩散条约》的担忧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**George Perkovich**: Well, I think Janice is right. I mean, I think from the Non-Proliferation treaty point of view, the missile defence isn't such a vital issue. Except, as she said, if it drives people to build up rather than to reduce their nuclear forces, I think the the bigger question would be if if Canada or other US allies started developing options to make nuclear weapons so different from missile defences, but nuclear weapons, that would be a big challenge to the Non-Proliferation treaty. And there's some discussion in South Korea once in a while in Poland, perhaps in Canada, that because the US has become unreliable in this regard, people may need to hedge their bets. And so that that is a concern about the Non-Proliferation treaty.

</details>

**主持人**: 马特。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Matt.

</details>

**马特·科尔达**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Matt Korda**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 真的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Really.

</details>

**马特·科尔达**: 真的令人震惊。只是为了回应乔治的评论，听到欧洲关于独立核威慑的讨论，确实令人震惊。而且这不仅来自两个核大国，还来自像德国这样的国家。所以这是一场与我们过去 75 年在欧洲听到的完全不同级别的讨论。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Matt Korda**: Really is striking. Just just to follow on George's comment, it really is striking to listen to the discussion in Europe about an independent nuclear deterrent. And it's coming not only from the two nuclear powers, but from a country like Germany. So this is a this is a discussion of an entirely different order than we've heard out of Europe, really, in the last 75 years.

</details>

### 新秩序与谈判困境

**主持人**: 嗯，让我们在这里抓住“新秩序”这个想法。马特，世界是否已经忘记了如何就核武器进行谈判，或者它是否根本不感兴趣？考虑到事物发生了一些变化？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Well, let's pick up on that idea of New Order here. Matt, has the world forgotten how to negotiate regarding nuclear weapons, or is it simply not interested in it? Seeing how things have changed a bit?

</details>

**马特·科尔达**: 是的。你知道，我们甚至在讨论各国可能拥有自己核武器的想法，这确实象征着世界发生了多大的变化？以及这在多大程度上造成了损害，你知道，特别是特朗普政府在如此短的时间内对全球不扩散和军备控制事业造成的损害。但这不仅仅是特朗普政府，对吧？还有其他核武器国家，它们实际上，你知道，正在行使其日益增长的帝国野心，针对它们的邻国。对？特别是俄罗斯。但是，你知道，我也把联合国、美国也包括在内，对吧，关于加拿大和格陵兰以及类似的事情。所以我们看到，你知道，在这个军备控制谈判的时代，各国实际上在努力坐在一起，寻找在军备控制方面通过对话解决分歧和解决分歧的价值。那个时代正在逐渐过去。而我们看到的是，各国更愿意点名和羞辱他们潜在的军备控制伙伴，而不是真正试图在否则相当不可预测的关系中注入可预测性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Matt Korda**: Yeah. You know, the fact that we're even having this discussion about the idea of countries potentially building their own nuclear weapons is really emblematic of how much the world has changed, right? And how much damage that for, you know, in particular, the Trump administration has done in such a short time to the global cause of non-proliferation and arms control. But it's not just the Trump administration, right? There are other nuclear armed states that are really, you know, sort of exercising increasingly imperial ambitions against their neighbours. Right? Russia in particular. But the, you know, I also lump the UN, the, the US in that as well, right, with regards to Canada and Greenland and things like that. And so we're seeing that, you know, in this era of, of arms control negotiations and countries really sort of making an effort to sit around the table from each other, finding value in talking through differences and resolving differences in arms control. That era is is increasingly over. And what we're seeing is that countries are much more interested in sort of naming and shaming their prospective arms control partners than actually trying to inject a sense of predictability into an otherwise quite, quite unpredictable relationship.

</details>

**主持人**: 珍妮丝，我想听听你的看法。但是，你知道，马特谈到了围坐在桌子旁。其中一部分是建立信任。我想帮助理解这个概念在理解和谈判这些交易方面有多重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Janice, I want to get your take on that. But, you know, Matt talks about sitting around that table. Part of that is having some trust. And I want to help understand how much is that concept important in sort of understanding and negotiating some of these deals?

</details>

**珍妮丝·斯坦**: 好的。嗯，你只是把它当作使几乎所有事情成为可能的一种粘合剂。但是，你知道，真的从**古巴导弹危机**之后开始，美国和苏联就坐到了谈判桌前，但信任度并不高。你与对手谈判。你不仅仅是与朋友谈判，你实际上是通过谈判过程建立这种信任。我认为不应该将其视为先决条件。那样我们会错过很多机会。不幸的是，我认为我们在过去几年里已经挖空了信任的储备，并且严重消耗了它。你知道，俄罗斯打破了欧洲的一项规范，那就是不侵犯你的邻国。欧洲人认为这在他们过去是远远落后的。这是一个非常粗鲁的冲击。而特朗普政府，我作为加拿大人可以告诉你，特朗普政府对非常亲密的盟友来说是一个粗鲁的冲击。所以我们减少了信任。而当信任度下降时，我认为比在上升期更难进行谈判。这就是我们所看到的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janice Stein**: Okay. Well, you just as a glue that makes almost everything possible. But, you know, beginning really after the Cuban Missile Crisis, the United States, Soviet Union came to the table with not a very high degree of trust. And you negotiate with your adversaries. You don't only negotiate with your friends, and you actually build that trust through the negotiation process. I don't think it's right to make it a requisite. We will miss a lot of opportunities that way. Unfortunately, I would say we have dug into the stockpile of trust over the last several years and depleted it very badly. You know, in Russia broke a norm in Europe, which is you don't invade your neighbour. Europeans thought that was way behind them in their past. It was very rude shock. And the Trump administration, I could tell you as a Canadian, the Trump administration has been a rude shock to very close allies. So we have diminished trust. And when you're on the downward slope of trust, it's harder to get a negotiation process going than when you're on the upside, I think, and that's why we're seeing what we're seeing.

</details>

**主持人**: 乔治，要让包括中国在内的大国回到谈判桌需要什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: George, what would it take to get major powers, China included, back to the negotiating table?

</details>

**乔治·佩尔科维奇**: 是的，我只是想接续珍妮丝的话，我认为她说得很对，你不能带着信任开始谈判。如果你有成功的或至少有希望的谈判，你就会建立信任。我想补充一点来回答你的问题，它必须从最高领导人开始。过去，当它奏效时，是美国或苏联或俄罗斯的国家元首，直接或秘密地，通常是相互沟通，说，看，我不喜欢事情的走向。我们应该改变它。或者任命一位特使，他去与对方的对口人员沟通，对方知道，好的，去和他们谈谈。他们代表总统或总书记发言。我认为这是摆脱当前困境的唯一途径。普京总统和习近平主席，特朗普总统是否会在某个时候相互沟通？好吧。我们必须让这件事走上正轨。我正在指定这个人与你的对口人员交谈。这可能需要秘密进行，我认为这是一件好事，可能会引起争议，但我认为这不会发生，尤其是现在美国不再进行任何公开对话，因为它变得太分散和难以管理了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**George Perkovich**: Yeah, I just picking up upon what Janice said, which I think was was right on that you that you don't start negotiations with trust. You build trust if you have successful or at least promising negotiations. And I would just add to that to answer your question, it has to start with the top leaders. And in the past when it worked, it was the head of state of the United States or the Soviet Union or Russia, either directly and secretly, usually communicating with each other, saying, look, I don't like where things are headed. We should change it. Or appointing a special emissary that their go to person that the other side knew, okay, talk to them. They speak for the president or they speak for the general secretary. And that, I think, is the only way out of the current predicament. Is it at some point does President Putin and does President Xi, does President Trump communicate with each other? All right. We got to get this on track. And I'm designating this person to talk to your counterpart. And this would probably need to be in secret, which I happen to think is a good thing can be controversial, but I don't see it happening, especially with the United States now through any kind of open dialogue, because it just gets too spun out and, and and unmanageable.

</details>

**主持人**: 马特，我想让你加入。珍妮丝提到了古巴导弹危机。对很多人来说，它说那是世界最接近核战争的时候。我想知道，我们今天离核战争的边缘有多近？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Matt, I want to get you in here. Janice had mentioned the Cuban Missile Crisis. For a lot of people, it said that's the closest the world has ever come to nuclear war. And I am curious how far or close to the brink of nuclear war are we today?

</details>

**马特·科尔达**: 你知道，我认为重要的是要注意，正如珍妮丝在开头提到的，你知道，当我们想到冷战期间的危机时，对吧，美国和苏联，这两个主要的核超级大国，导弹互相指向对方。对。那是一个极其危险的局面。但今天不同的是，你不仅仅只有这两个国家，对吧？你有九个核武器国家。它们之间都有相互关联的威慑关系。因此，你知道，一场仅仅涉及两个国家的危机几乎肯定会失控，并涉及除这两个国家之外的其他国家。因此，例如，美国可能想建造一种新的武器系统来应对俄罗斯正在做的事情。对。但然后中国将如何应对，考虑到美中之间的紧张关系？对。然后如果中国做出回应，中国和印度之间存在某种持续的边界冲突。他们最近一次发生武装冲突是在 2021 年，对吧。考虑到印度和巴基斯坦之间的历史紧张关系，巴基斯坦将如何应对印度所做的事情？因此，这种情况会产生多米诺骨牌效应。因此，你可以很容易地想象一场危机，这场危机最初可能只涉及两个国家，但迅速升级到三个，也许四个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Matt Korda**: You know, I think what's really important to note, and Janice mentioned this up top, is that, you know, when we think about crises during the Cold War, right, the US and the Soviet Union, these two major nuclear superpowers with missiles pointed at each other. Right. That was an incredibly dangerous situation. But what's different about today is that you don't just have these two countries, right? You have nine nuclear armed states. They all have interlocking deterrence relationships with one another. And so, you know, a crisis that involves just two countries is almost certainly, you know, likely to spin out of control and involve additional countries beyond just those two. And so, for example, the United States may want to build a new weapon system to respond to something that Russia is doing. Right. But then how is China supposed to react to that, given tensions between the US and China? Right. And then if China responds, China and India have sort of a simmering border conflict. They engaged in a shooting war as recently as 2021, right. How is Pakistan supposed to respond to what India does given, you know, historic tensions between India and Pakistan? And so this sort of goes in a in quite a domino effect. And you can really easily imagine how a crisis that starts with potentially just two countries rapidly escalates to maybe three, maybe four.

**珍妮丝·斯坦**: 你知道，我只是想以一个乐观的音符结束，马特。好的。你刚才描述了我之前所说的，即“三体效应”，计算变得如此紧张。但这导致了武器的积累。令人着迷的是，尽管他们的本土受到了攻击，核大国并没有用核武器回应。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Janice Stein**: You know, I just want with an optimistic note here, Matt. Okay. You just described what I was talking about earlier, the three body effect where the calculations get so tight. But that leads to accumulation of weapons. It's really fascinating that even though their homelands have been attacked, nuclear powers have not responded with nuclear weapons.

**珍妮丝·斯坦**: 我刚刚完成了一篇关于这个的文章。核武器实际上是一个糟糕的赌注。投资回报率不高。伊朗发射了一系列导弹攻击以色列。它没有威胁或考虑使用核武器。乌克兰回应了俄罗斯的恶毒袭击，俄罗斯谈到了使用战术核武器。中国人、印度人，应拜登总统的要求，站出来反对它。就是这样。战争已经持续了四年多，比第二次世界大战还要长，他们没有使用核武器。印度和巴基斯坦已经打了三场战争。他们都有二次打击能力。双方都没有威胁使用核武器。所以这里仍然有一条非常、非常、非常难以跨越的界限。尽管所有这些相互关联的影响，我认为我们想区分制造它们和使用它们。这是两个不同的宇宙。

**Janice Stein**: And I've just finished a piece at that. Nuclear weapons are actually a bad bet. There's not very much return on investment. Iran fired a, you know, a barrage of missiles at Israel. It did not threaten or contemplate or think about using nuclear weapons. Ukraine responded to a vicious attack by Russia, and the Russians talked about using tactical nuclear weapons. The Chinese and the Indians, at the request of President Biden, spoke out against it. That was it. And the war has been going on for more than four years, longer than World War II, and they have not used nuclear weapons. India and Pakistan have fought three wars since. Each of them have a second strike capability. Neither side has threatened to use nuclear weapons. So there is still a line here that is very, very, very difficult to cross. Despite all these interlocking effects, I think we want to distinguish between building them up and using them. Those are two separate universes.

**主持人**: 乔治，我要让你加入。正如我们所注意到的，你知道，美国袭击了伊拉克，北约袭击了利比亚。伊朗现在正受到美国的军事行动威胁。像这样的事件在影响非核国家考虑探索这些选项方面有多重要？也许，正如珍妮丝所说，制造它们？

**Host**: George, I'm going to get you in there. As we noted, you know, the US has a has attacked Iraq, NATO attacked Libya. Iran is now being threatened with US military action. How significant are events like this in swaying non-nuclear nations in considering exploring these options? And perhaps, as Janet said, building up building it up?

</details>

**乔治·佩尔科维奇**: 嗯，我认为这取决于双方。我认为有一种冲动，或者想象如果我们拥有核武器，伊拉克、利比亚等就不会发生这种情况。因此，旁观者会想，天哪，他们应该拥有核武器，也许我们也应该这样做。事实证明，获得核武器非常困难。所以我们谈论的每个国家都有某种程度的拥有核武器的野心，并且它们被阻止了。所以以色列有一项标准政策。它对叙利亚做过。它对伊拉克做过。它对伊朗做过。它还进行了暗杀。它不让对手获得核武器。美国也说了同样的话。所以虽然诱人，但你必须回答，好吧，我们需要多久才能获得核武器？而我们在试图获得它们的时候会发生什么？所以波兰出于非常充分的理由提到了这种可能性，鉴于俄罗斯对乌克兰所做的一切。嗯，你现在可以很容易地想象波兰的工程师和科学家在波兰街头被暗杀，俄罗斯的破坏行动。如果俄罗斯认为波兰试图获取核武器，你需要多少？如果你要对抗俄罗斯，它拥有你想要的任何数量的数千件武器？所以事实证明，无论它是否是一个有教育意义的想法，实际上它会带来比人们轻易能够管理的更多问题。我会这么说。

**George Perkovich**: Well, I think it goes both ways. I think there's an impulse or to imagine if we had had nuclear weapons, this wouldn't have happened if we were Iraq, Libya, etc. And so for bystanders to look and say, Jesus, they should have gotten nuclear weapons, maybe we should do that. Turns out it's very hard to get nuclear weapons. So each of those countries that we talk about did have some level of ambition to get nuclear weapons, and they were stopped. So Israel has a standard policy. It's done it with Syria. It's done it with Iraq. It's done it with Iran. It's done assassinations with people elsewhere. It doesn't let an adversary get nuclear weapons. The US has kind of said the same thing. So while it's tempting, you have to answer, okay, how long will it take us to get nuclear weapons? And what happens to us while we're trying to get them? So Poland has mentioned this possibility for very good reason, given what Russia has done to Ukraine. Well, you can readily imagine now Poland's engineers and scientists being assassinated in the streets in in Poland, sabotage operations from Russia. If Russia thought Poland was trying to acquire nuclear weapons, how many do you need? If you're going to try to go against Russia, which has however many thousands you want to count? So it turns out whether or not it's a seductive idea, in practice, it raises many more problems than than people can readily kind of manage. I would say.

**珍妮丝·斯坦**: 我完全同意乔治的观点，即走上获取核武器的道路是一个非常危险的过程。伊朗之所以走到今天这一步，就是因为这个。而且，你知道，只是为了强调乔治刚才所说的，对我来说，一个真正令人震惊的事情是，乌克兰将无人机装载在平板卡车上，穿越俄罗斯边境。我深入到俄罗斯中部，亚洲部分，并使用这些无人机攻击战略轰炸机，其中一些是战略舰队的一部分，用于发射核武器。俄罗斯没有回应。有，我认为，最强有力的反扩散论点。我看着乔治的我们说，我们必须让他们成为糟糕的投资。它们是糟糕的赌注。它们不起作用，它们不会带来回报。

**Janice Stein**: I completely agree with George that embarking on the path to get a nuclear weapon is a very dangerous process. Iran is where it is today because of that. And, you know, just to underline what George was saying right now, one of the really striking things to me was when Ukraine smuggled drones on flatbed trucks across Russia's border. I went way deep into, you know, the central, the Asian part of Russia and use those drones against strategic bombers, which some of which were part of the strategic fleet to launch nuclear weapons. Russia did not respond. There are, I think, the most powerful anti-proliferation arguments. And I'm looking at George's we say this we have to make is they're just lousy investments. They're bad bets. They're don't do it, they don't pay off.
