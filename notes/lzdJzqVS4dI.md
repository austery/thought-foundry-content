### 联邦特工枪杀事件

**Rachel Abrams**: 警告，本期节目包含暴力描述和粗俗语言。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: A warning that this episode contains descriptions of violence and graphic language.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 来自《纽约时报》，我是 Rachel Abrams，这里是《每日新闻》。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: From the New York Times. I'm Rachel Abrams and this is the Daily.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 你刚才做了什么？你到底做了什么？明尼阿波利斯发生骚乱和抗议，此前联邦特工枪杀了一名男子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: The [ ] DID YOU JUST DO? WHAT THE [ ] DID YOU JUST DO? Outrage and protest in Minneapolis after federal agents shoot and kill a man today.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 周六，边境巡逻队特工在明尼阿波利斯枪杀了一名男子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Border Patrol agents shot and killed a man in Minneapolis on Saturday.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 这是不到一个月内，联邦当局与抗议者发生的第二次致命冲突。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: The second fatal clash between federal authorities and protesters in less than a month.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 你们是凶手。你们怎么敢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: You murder. How dare you.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 目击者视频再次显示，鲁莽、暴力且危险的联邦特工夺走了一个人的生命。如果这里会发生，那么你的社区也可能发生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Eyewitness video shows once again reckless, violent, and dangerous federal agents taking the life of a man. If it can happen here, it can happen in your community, too.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 这次枪击事件在全国范围内引发了新一轮的愤怒和谴责。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: The shooting prompted a fresh wave of fury and condemnation across the country.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 为了结束这项行动，还有多少美国人需要死亡或受重伤？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: How many more Americans need to die or get badly hurt for this operation to end?

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 这让这座一直在反抗联邦政府移民镇压的城市的居民感到震惊。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: And it horrified residents in a city that has been revolting against a federal government crackdown on immigration.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 这名携带武器和弹药来阻止执法行动的个人，犯下了国内恐怖主义行为。这是事实。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: This individual who came with weapons and ammunition to stop a law enforcement operation of federal law enforcement officers committed an act of domestic terrorism. That's the facts.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 任何想和平示威的人，都不会带着一把装满两个弹匣的枪出现在抗议现场。那不是和平抗议，你无权触碰执法人员。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: No one who wants to be peaceful shows up at a protest with a firearm that is loaded with two full magazines. That is not a peaceful protest and you do not get to touch law enforcement.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 联邦官员声称，抗议者是攻击者，而特工是出于自卫。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Federal officials alleged that the protester was the aggressor and that the agents acted in self-defense.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 天哪。哦，他们刚才看到一个人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Oh my god. Oh, they just saw somebody.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 但枪击视频直接反驳了这一说法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: But videos of the shooting directly contradict that claim.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 今天，我们采访了我们的同事 Devon Lum 和 Ernesto Londono，了解这次枪击事件是如何发生的以及接下来可能会发生什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Today, we talked to our colleagues Devon Lum and Ernesto Londono about how the shooting unfolded and what may come next.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 现在是 1 月 26 日，星期一。Devon，欢迎来到《每日新闻》。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: It's Monday, January 26th. Devon, welcome to the Daily.

</details>

**Devon Lum**: 谢谢邀请。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devon Lum**: Thanks for having me.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: Devon，现在我想很多人都看到了这段非常真实的视频，视频中可以看到一个名叫 Alex Prey 的男子被明尼苏达州的联邦特工枪杀。国土安全部声称，Prey 曾携带手枪接近特工，意图进行他们所说的“大屠杀”。你是我们视觉调查团队的成员，这意味着你花了大量时间分析这次枪击事件的视频和现场情况。那么，你如何看待政府的说法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: So Devon, by now I think a lot of people have seen this really graphic footage of a man named Alex Prey getting shot by federal agents in Minnesota. The Department of Homeland Security claims that Prey was approaching these agents with a handgun, that he was intent on committing what they called, quote, a massacre. You are a member of our visual investigations team, which means that you have been spending a lot of time analyzing footage from this shooting, from the scene. So, what do you make of the government's claims?

</details>

**Devon Lum**: 在过去的 डेढ़天里，我们一直在从不同角度分析视频，试图更好地理解枪击发生前、中、后的情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devon Lum**: We've been analyzing footage from various different angles over the past day and a half trying to better understand what took place before, during, and after the shooting.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 嗯。你知道，联邦政府和州政府之间存在争议，我们正尽力通过尽可能清晰深入地梳理视觉证据来解决这一争议。在我们的分析中，有一点非常明确，与政府在枪击事件发生后立即发布的说法形成鲜明对比的是：Prey 在与联邦特工互动时，或者在整个互动过程中，并没有持枪。他手里拿着的是一部手机。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Mhm. You know, there's contention over what happened between the federal government and the state government, and we're doing our best to resolve that contention by walking through the visual evidence as clearly and as in-depth as we possibly can. And the one thing that's blatantly clear in our analysis that contrasts with the narrative that the administration put out there in the immediate aftermath of the shooting is that Freddy was not holding a gun when he began interacting with the federal agents or throughout the entirety of their interaction. Instead, he's holding a cell phone.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: Devon，你能描述一下你分析的视频开头时的场景吗？我们看到了什么？发生了什么？视频开始时，两名抗议者正在明尼阿波利斯街头与一名联邦特工互动，地点在一间甜甜圈店前。我们可以看到 Prey 走入街道，伸出手臂，手里拿着手机正在录像。此刻他似乎只是一个旁观者。他站在离互动地点稍远的地方，用空着的手似乎在指挥交通。事情是如何升级的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: And can you just set the scene, Devon, at the beginning of the footage that you've been analyzing? What do we see? What's going on? The footage begins with two protesters interacting with a federal agent on a street in Minneapolis in front of a doughnut shop. We can see that Freddy is walking into the street with his outstretched arm holding his cell phone recording the interaction. He appears to be an observer in this moment. He's standing, you know, further away from where that interaction is taking place

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 然后用空着的手似乎在指挥交通。事情是如何升级的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: and appears to be directing traffic with his free hand. And how do things escalate from there?

</details>

**Devon Lum**: 那名与街上两名抗议者互动的特工开始将抗议者推向 Prey 先生所在的方向，最终他们走向了他站立的地方。在详细说明之前，我想说接下来的几秒钟发生得非常快。从事情开始升级到最后一枪打响，仅仅过去了 40 多秒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devon Lum**: The agent who was interacting with the two protesters standing in the street begins to push the protesters in the direction of Mr. Prey and eventually they make their way towards where he's standing. So before I get into the details, I just want to say that these next moments happen very quickly. From the time that things started to escalate until the final shot is fired, just over 40 seconds elapsed.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 哇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Wow.

</details>

**Devon Lum**: 他们到达后，特工将一名抗议者推倒在地，Alex Prey 介入到特工和刚才被推倒在地的女士之间。特工开始对他喷射胡椒喷雾。在那一刻，我们看到他仍然拿着手机，另一只手是空的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devon Lum**: Once they get there, the agent pushes one of the protesters to the ground and Alex Prey steps in between the agent and the woman who has just been pushed to the ground. The agent begins firing pepper spray at him. In that moment, we can see that he's still holding his cell phone and his other hand is still free.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Mhm.

</details>

**Devon Lum**: 然后 Alex Prey 转身，显然是想去扶起那位被推倒在地的女士。特工继续向他们两人喷射胡椒喷雾。几名特工出现在 Prey 先生身后，开始拉扯他，试图将他按倒在地。当他倒在地上后，几名其他特工按住他。他们抓住他的腿。嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devon Lum**: Then Alex Prey turns around to apparently try to help the woman who's been pushed to the ground up to her feet and the agent continues firing pepper spray at both of them. Several agents appear behind Mr. Prey and begin pulling him in order to get him down to the ground. Once he's down on the ground, several other agents are holding him down. They're grabbing at his legs. Mhm.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 他们推他的背，似乎在反复击打他。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: They're pushing him in his back and they appear to be striking him repetitively.

</details>

**Devon Lum**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devon Lum**: Mhm.

</details>

**Devon Lum**: 另一名特工走向人群，伸出双手去抓 Alex Prey。那一刻还不清楚他为什么这样做，但几秒钟后，我们听到有人反复说“他有枪”。他们反复地说。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devon Lum**: Another agent walks towards the scrum and reaches toward Alex Prey with open hands. It's unclear at that moment why he's grabbing at him, but a few seconds later we hear someone saying he's got a gun over and over again. They say it repetitively,

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 这意味着他们可能直到他倒在地上时才意识到他有枪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: meaning that they might not have realized that he had a gun until that moment when he's on the ground.

</details>

**Devon Lum**: 正是如此。而且，回顾视频，从互动的任何时刻直到现在，都没有任何视觉线索表明特工们知道他携带武器。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devon Lum**: Exactly. And again, looking back at the footage, from any point of the interaction up until now, there is no visual giveaway that would indicate that agents knew that he was armed.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 那么，接下来发生了什么？当他被制服并倒在地上后，现场是如何发展的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: So, what happens next? How does the scene unfold from there once he's restrained and on the ground?

</details>

**Devon Lum**: 那名伸出双手进入人群的特工，从 Alex Prey 的腰间抓起了一把枪。然后，在 Prey 的枪被移走大约一秒钟后，另一名特工开出了第一枪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devon Lum**: The agent who reached into the scrum with open hands, grabs a firearm from Alex Freddy's waist. Then about 1 second after Freddy's gun has been removed, another agent fires the first shot.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 所以他能看到另一名特工拔枪吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: So he can see the other agent taking the gun out of the holster.

</details>

**Devon Lum**: 我们不确定他此刻看到了什么，因为这发生得非常快。但在视频中，他似乎对夺枪的过程有清晰的视野。所以，此刻，为了说清楚，一名特工已经移走了枪，并退到了 Alex Prey 身后，就在那时我们听到了第一声枪响。是的，那把枪据称是从 Alex Prey 的臀部移走的，在第一枪打响前就已经远离了人群。第一枪打响后，Prey 似乎跪了起来，他原本抱在头部的双手移向身体两侧。特工又开了三枪，Prey 开始倒向地面。他倒下时用左手向下伸，似乎是想支撑自己，他的双手都没有出现武器。然后，最初对他喷射胡椒喷雾的特工也加入进来，两人一共向 Prey 的身体开了六枪，此时他已经倒在地上，一动不动。总共，他们似乎在 5 秒内开了 10 枪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devon Lum**: We're not exactly sure what he's seeing at this point because it's a very split second, but in the video it appears he has a clear vantage point of the disarming as it's happening. So, at this point, just to be clear, one agent has removed the gun, has backed away from Alex Prey, and that's when we hear the first shot that was fired. Yes, the gun that was apparently removed from Alex Py's hip is away from the pile before the first shot is fired. And after that first shot is fired, Freddy appears to get up onto his knees, and his hands, which were bunched up near his head, move down towards his sides. The agent fires three more times and Freddy begins to fall to the ground. He reaches down with his left hand while falling, apparently to brace himself and there is not appear to be weapons in either of his hands. Then the agent who initially pepper-sprayed Freddy joins in, and the two of them fire six more shots at Py's disarmed body, which is at this point laying motionless on the ground. In total, they appear to fire 10 shots in 5 seconds.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 在稍后的视频中，我们可以听到特工们在搜查 Alex Prey 的身体，在他已经被枪杀后。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: We can hear in later footage that as agents are searching Alex Party's body after he's already been shot.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 一名特工喊道：“枪在哪儿？枪在哪儿？”所以显然不是所有特工都知道 Alex Prey 已经被缴械了。你知道，考虑到第一枪是在 Prey 的枪被移走后大约一秒钟才开的，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: One agent yells, "Where's the gun? Where's the gun?" So clearly not all of the agents know that Alex Prey had already been disarmed. You know, given the fact that the first shot was fired only about a second after PR's gun was removed,

</details>

**Devon Lum**: 即使开枪的特工可能看到枪被从枪套里取出，但这一切发生得太快了，你无法确定他开枪时是否真的知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devon Lum**: even though the agent who shot Alex Prey might have been able to see that the gun had been unholstered, it all is happening so fast that you can't know for sure whether he definitely knew that when he was firing.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 嗯，当然，很难知道开枪的特工在开枪时看到了什么或知道了什么，除了知道有枪存在。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Well, sure, it's it's difficult to know what the agent who fired saw or knew when he fired other than that there was a gun present.

</details>

**Devon Lum**: 嗯。但我们确实知道的是，Alex Prey 在地上时已经被完全制服了。他被按住，手臂放在头边。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devon Lum**: Mhm. But what we do know is that Alex Prey was very clearly subdued on the ground. He was being held down and his arms were by his head.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 而且，特工站在 Prey 的身后，瞄准他的背部。所以当时他并没有对特工构成明显的威胁。但我想强调的是，国土安全部发布的声明是 Prey 携带枪支接近一名特工。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: And again, the agent was standing behind Prey. He was aiming at his back. So he presented no clear threat to the agents at that point. But I want to stress that the statement that is being made by the Department of Homeland Security is that Freddy approached an agent with a gun.

</details>

**Devon Lum**: 对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devon Lum**: Right?

</details>

**Devon Lum**: 这是真的，他确实携带枪支，但视频显示，在与特工的整个互动过程中，他并没有用手拿着枪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devon Lum**: It's true. He was armed with a gun, but the videos show he was not holding it in his hand throughout the entire interaction with the agents.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Mhm.

</details>

**Devon Lum**: 国土安全部还说，特工是出于对特工安全的担忧而开枪的。所以，如果我们看视频并评估是否存在安全担忧，我们可以看到 Prey 倒在地上，他被制服了，即使他臀部有枪，在某个时刻他也够不着。所以，回应是开枪射击他，而不是先花点时间了解另一名特工，你的同事，是否已经缴械了要射击的人。这与国土安全部所说的完全不符。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devon Lum**: The Department of Homeland Security also said the agent fired out of concern for the agents safety. So, if we're looking at the footage and we're assessing whether or not there's a concern for safety, we can see that Freddy is on the ground, he's being subdued, and even if there's a gun on his hip, at one point, he can't reach it. So, the response to shoot him, to pull out a firearm and and shoot him rather than taking a beat to understand whether another agent, one of your colleagues, has disarmed the person you're about to shoot. It just doesn't comport with what the Department of Homeland Security is saying.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 你知道，我们大约一周前在节目中采访了同事 Charles Has。他当时描述说，那段时间似乎有点平静，因为距离联邦特工枪杀 Renee Good 已经过去几天了。显然，人们走上街头表示愤怒，但感觉 ICE 的行动也变得不那么显眼了。当时，是否会升级或缓和局势，似乎还是个悬而未决的问题。而现在，仅仅几天后，我们又不得不面对另一起致命枪击事件。是的，这是不到一个月内联邦特工在明尼阿波利斯发生的第二次枪击事件，而我们分析的视频证据与国土安全部关于事件经过的声明相冲突。紧张气氛已经很高，线上、全国各地以及明尼阿波利斯当地都如此，这无疑会火上浇油。Devon Lum，非常感谢你。谢谢邀请。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: You know, we talked to our colleague Charles Has on the show about a week ago. He described at that point what felt almost like a lull in the sense that it had been a few days since a federal agent had shot Renee Good. Obviously, people had taken to the streets were outraged, but it felt also like ICE was operating a little bit less visibly. And I think it was kind of an open question at that time whether things would escalate or would deescalate. And it feels really notable that here we are just a few days later reacting to another fatal shooting. Yes, this is the second shooting in less than a month that's been carried out by federal agents in Minneapolis where the footage that we've analyzed has conflicted with statements that have been made by the Department of Homeland Security about what took place. Tensions are already high online, around the country, and on the ground in Minneapolis, and this is sure to inflame them further. Devon Lum, thank you so much. Thanks for having me.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 我们马上回来。Ernesto，你好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: We'll be right back. Ernesto. Hi.

</details>

**Ernesto Londono**: 你好，Rachel。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ernesto Londono**: Hi, Rachel.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: Ernesto，我想问问，在 Alex Prey 被枪杀后的几个小时里，当地的情况怎么样？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: I wonder Ernesto, could you just tell us what it's been like on the ground in the hours since Alex Prey was shot?

</details>

**Ernesto Londono**: 我认为这座城市的人们都处于震惊之中。自从上个月底移民镇压开始以来，一直有一种感觉，事情正在以一种不可持续的方式升级。周六早上，又有一名个人被联邦特工杀害。在这两种情况下，都是美国公民决定走上街头，监督和挑战移民特工的工作。在这两种情况下，他们都被枪杀了。我认为，无论是地方政府还是普通居民，都在拼命想找到一条出路，摆脱他们认为非常危险的局面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ernesto Londono**: I think this is a city where people are shell shocked. Ever since this immigration crackdown began late last month, there's been sort of a sense that things are escalating in a way that feels unsustainable. And Saturday morning, a second individual was killed by federal agents. In both cases, these were American citizens who had decided to take to the streets to monitor and to challenge the work of immigration agents. And in both cases they were gunned down. And I think people both in local government but just residents have been trying desperately to find an offramp from a situation they think is really dangerous.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 你能谈谈我们目前对 Alex Prey 的了解吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Can you talk about what we know about Alex Prey as of now?

</details>

**Ernesto Londono**: 是的，我们知道他曾是当地一家 VA 医院的护士。据我们所知，他非常关心他的病人，并且是他社区里备受爱戴的一员。我们知道他携带武器，并且他被允许拥有枪支，事发时他也携带了枪支。我们知道他没有犯罪记录，而且他是一名联邦雇员。所以，我认为我们还没有看到任何证据表明他是一个暴力的人，但我们才刚刚开始，你知道，才过去 24 小时。所以，我认为在接下来的几个小时和几天里，我们会了解到很多信息。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ernesto Londono**: Yes, we know that he was a nurse at the VA locally. We are told that he cared deeply for his patients and that he was a beloved member of his community. We know that he carried a weapon and that he was allowed to be a gun owner and that he was armed when this occurred. We know he had no criminal record and you know he was a federal employee. So, I don't think we've seen any evidence to suggest that he was a violent person, but we're only, you know, about 24 hours into this. So, I think there's a lot we will learn in the hours and days ahead.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 关于边境巡逻队当时在现场做什么，我们知道些什么？例如，我们知道他们当时试图逮捕谁吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: What do we know about what Border Patrol was doing at the scene at that moment? Do we know anything about who they were trying to apprehend, for instance?

</details>

**Ernesto Londono**: 我们听说边境巡逻队特工正在寻找一个特定的人，一名来自厄瓜多尔的移民，他们将其描述为一个有严重犯罪历史、一个暴力分子。特朗普政府的说法是，任何阻碍这些特工工作的人都是不可原谅的，因为他们只是为了维护秩序，保护人民和社区的安全。然而，就在枪击事件发生几小时后，明尼苏达州惩教部（负责监狱系统）出来说：“嘿，我们调查了这件事。我们查阅了法院记录。我们找不到任何证据表明此人除了一些轻微的交通违章之外还有其他记录。”所以，基本上，州政府对导致这起杀人事件的行动的起源泼了冷水。如果枪击是由当地当局执行的，你可以想象并预测接下来会发生什么，尤其是在使用武力调查方面。枪击事件显然是由边境巡逻队特工执行的。所以我想知道，在这种情况下，事后通常会如何处理？你通常会期待什么，我们现在知道什么？过去，例如，当一名美国法警几年前在这里使用致命武力时，联邦政府、司法部及其民权办公室会迅速与在该州拥有最多使用武力案件专业知识的机构合作。他们共同收集和审查证据，试图弄清楚官员在使用致命武力时，是否出于对自身或他人安全的恐惧，认为这是在面临危险威胁时唯一能确保安全的方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ernesto Londono**: So what we heard is that the border patrol agents were trying to find a specific guy, an immigrant from Ecuador, that they portrayed as somebody with a very significant criminal history, somebody who was violent. And what the Trump administration is saying is any effort of people impeding the work of these agents is unconscionable because they're just here to impose order and to keep people and neighborhoods safe. However, just hours after the shooting, you had the Minnesota Department of Corrections, which runs the prison system, come out and say, "Hey, we looked into this matter. We looked into court records. We can't find evidence that this individual has anything beyond some misdemeanor traffic citations. So, you know, essentially the state is pouring cold water on the genesis of the operation that led to this killing. If the shooting had been done by local authorities, you could imagine and predict sort of what would happen next just in terms of an investigation into the use of force. The shooting obviously happened by a border patrol agent. So I wonder how would it normally work in the aftermath of this kind of a thing. What would you normally expect and what do we know about what is happening now? So the way this has been handled in the past, for instance, when there was a US marshal who used deadly force here a few years ago is the federal government, the department of justice and its office of civil rights partners quickly with the state agency that has the most expertise in use of force cases. And they collect and review evidence jointly trying to make sense of whether the officer when he or she used deadly force had a credible fear that that was the only means to remain safe in the face of a dire threat to the agent or to others around them.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 到目前为止出现的这些视频，虽然确实为我们提供了对那一刻发生情况的大量洞察，但它们只是故事的一部分。通常，当进行此类调查时，你会尝试获取更多关于之前的视频，了解几分钟前发生的事情，尝试获取目击者对交流内容的陈述。所以通常需要几周甚至几个月的时间，调查人员才能拼凑出一个完整且确凿的画面，从而决定是否应提起诉讼。嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: These videos that have emerged to date, you know, while really providing us considerable amount of insight into what happened in that moment are only part of the story. And usually when this kind of investigation is conducted, you try to get more video of what was happening, you know, minutes before this, you try to get witness accounts of what was being said, you know, as part of this exchange. So typically, it takes weeks, if not months, for investigators to assemble a complete and conclusive picture that allows them to decide whether or not a prosecution is warranted. Mhm.

</details>

**Ernesto Londono**: 在本月初，Renee Good 被枪杀事件发生后，你立即看到特朗普政府的高级官员表示，州机构被排除在调查之外。这对于这类枪击事件来说是非常反常的，并立即引起了地方官员的担忧，担心会发生掩盖事实的行为，我们得不到公正彻底的调查。嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ernesto Londono**: What you saw in the immediate aftermath of the initial shooting early this month, the shooting of Renee Good is that top officials in the Trump administration said that the state agency was being cut off of the investigation. This was highly anomalous for these kind of shootings and it immediately created a concern among local officials that there was going to be a cover up, that we weren't going to get a proper and thorough investigation. Mhm.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 所以，亨内平县（包括明尼阿波利斯）的地方检察官的做法是，在无法收集第一手证据、法医证据和证人证词的情况下，她创建了一个在线门户网站，并要求社区民众提交视频和其他证据，以帮助她的办公室确定是否发生了犯罪以及是否有足够的证据起诉特工。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: So what the local prosecutor in Henipin County, which includes Minneapolis, did was in the absence of sort of the ability of gathering firthand evidence, forensic evidence and witness testimony from the kind of people that would normally be involved in this kind of an investigation. She created an online portal and asked people out in the community to submit videos and any other evidence that might help her office establish whether or not a crime occurred and whether or not there's enough evidence to bring charges against the agents.

</details>

**Ernesto Londono**: 这听起来非常不寻常。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ernesto Londono**: That sounds extremely unusual.

</details>

**Ernesto Londono**: 用“不寻常”来形容这件事简直是低估了。快进几周，周六又发生了这第二次致命枪击事件。一开始，赶到现场试图保护和检查证据的地方和州官员被物理阻挡了。截至目前，他们甚至不知道开枪的联邦特工的身份。所以，像了解被调查者的身份这样基本的事情，都会让任何被视为可信和令人满意的起诉或调查变得非常非常困难。

**Ernesto Londono**: To call this unusual would be the understatement of the decade. And fast forward a couple of weeks when we have this second fatal shooting on Saturday. At the outset, local and state officials who ran to the scene to try to preserve and examine evidence were physically blocked from getting there. And as of this moment, they don't even know the identity of the federal agents who opened fire. So something as basic as knowing who it is you're investigating is going to make any prosecution or any investigation that people regard as credible and satisfying really really hard.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 同时，当然，你已经看到联邦官员出来做出结论，好像调查已经完成一样。有 Cash Patel 和 Christine Gnome 说这个人是个威胁，他有枪，他威胁了特工。所以，尽管调查仍在进行中，但你已经看到联邦官员，就像在 Renee Good 事件之后一样，出来基本上陈述事实，好像我们已经确定了一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: And in the meantime, of course, you already have federal officials coming out and making conclusions as though an investigation has already been conducted. You have Cash Patel and you have Christine Gnome saying this guy was a menace. He had a gun. He was threatening agents. So while an investigation is still pending, you already have federal officials, much like in the aftermath of Renee Good, coming out and basically stating what happened as if we know for certain.

</details>

**Ernesto Londono**: 完全正确。你知道，通常在这种创伤性事件发生后，会有呼吁保持冷静和耐心。但在这个案例中，我们看到的是相反的情况。我们看到联邦官员使用极具煽动性和令人震惊的语言来描述那些观察、记录和挑战移民特工工作的人的行为。他们将其中一些人定性为国内恐怖分子。司法部已经对州长 Tim Walls、明尼阿波利斯市长 Jacob Fry、圣保罗市长（几天前刚就职）、总检察长以及明尼阿波利斯地区检察官展开了调查。争论的焦点是，所有这些民主党民选官员的言论，都被联邦政府视为对其移民执法行动的危险行为，因为他们一直在抵制、批评和挑战它。是否有任何证据表明地方执法部门实际上在阻碍或干涉联邦官员的驱逐行动？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ernesto Londono**: Absolutely. And you know, usually there's an appeal for calm and patience in the wake of these kind of incidents which are so traumatic for communities. What we've seen in the case is the opposite. We've seen federal officials use really incendiary and jarring language to describe the conduct of people who have been observing, documenting, and challenging the work of immigration agents. They've characterized some of these people as domestic terrorists. And the Department of Justice has launched an investigation into the governor, Tim Walls, the mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Fry, the mayor of St. Paul, who just got inaugurated a few days ago, the attorney general, and the top prosecutor in Minneapolis. And the contention is that all these Democratic elected officials have been speaking in ways that the federal government deems dangerous for their immigration enforcement operation because they've been resisting it and criticizing it and challenging it. Is there any evidence that local law enforcement is in fact obstructing or interfering with federal officials in their deportation efforts?

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 没有。需要指出的是，明尼阿波利斯市和圣保罗市选择不与民事移民执法合作，这意味着这些城市的警察不会询问居民的移民身份。然而，当涉及到监狱里的在押人员时，州政府表示他们会例行合作，以确保对那些将被释放的、受驱逐令影响的个人进行无缝且实际的移交，无论是他们因完成刑期而从州监狱释放，还是从看守所释放。所以，地方官员表示，认为明尼苏达州是一个激进的庇护州，当地政府实际上在保护非法移民的说法是明显错误的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: No. It's important to point out that the city of Minneapolis and the city of St. Paul, they have chosen not to cooperate with civil immigration enforcement, meaning police officers in these cities do not ask residents about their immigration status. However, when it comes to people who are in jails and prisons, the state says that they cooperate routinely in facilitating a seamless and practical handover of individuals who are subject to deportation who are about to be released either from state prisons because they've completed their sentence or from jails. So local officials say the sense that Minnesota is this kind of radical sanctuary state where people who are here legally are essentially shielded by the local government is blatantly false.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: 你能给我们讲讲州官员是如何回应的吗？比如 Tim Waltz、Jacob Fry 市长、Amy Klobuchar 参议员。他们在说什么？自第一次枪击事件以来，他们的言论有何变化？他们正在起诉政府，试图让法官命令政府结束移民镇压。周六的枪击事件导致州长 Walls 部署了国民警卫队，因为我认为他和他的政府认为，这座城市可能会像 2020 年 George Floyd 被杀事件那样再次爆发。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Can you walk us through how state officials are responding? People like Tim Waltz, Mayor Jacob Fry, Senator Amy Clolobachar. What are they saying? And and how has any of that rhetoric shifted since the first shooting? They are suing the administration trying to see if a judge orders the administration to put an end to the immigration crackdown. And Saturday's shooting led Governor Walls to deploy the National Guard because I think he and people in his administration feel that this city could once again blow up the way we saw in the wake of George Floyd's killing in 2020.

</details>

**Rachel Abrams**: M，所以我想谈谈更广泛的政治回应。现在，明尼苏达州及其他地区的民选官员是否正在考虑其他选择？来自明尼苏达州的联邦议员似乎一致认为，也许唯一能阻止这一切的方法，或者说他们拥有的少数几个能影响特朗普政府的权力杠杆，就是威胁要扣留国土安全部的资金。然而，问题是，考虑到共和党控制着国会两院，是否会有足够多的共和党人倒戈，与民主党达成一致。虽然我认为我们开始看到共和党人流露出不安的迹象，但要说是否有足够多的选票和足够多的反对声音来真正产生影响，还远不清楚。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: M so I want to talk about the broader political response for a moment. Are there other options that elected officials both in Minnesota and beyond are considering right now? Federal lawmakers from Minnesota appear to be in lock step thinking that maybe the only way to shut this down or to use one of the few levers of power they have over the Trump administration is the threat of withholding funding for the Department of Homeland Security. The question though, you know, considering the fact that Republicans are in control of both chambers and Capitol Hill, is whether you could have enough Republicans peel off and agree with Democrats. And while I think we're starting to see glimmers of Republicans signaling discomfort, it's far from clear whether you'd have enough votes and enough opposition to really make a difference.

**Ernesto Londono**: 这个国家的民意调查显示，大多数人支持特朗普政府提出的处理移民问题的目标，即关闭边境，遣返非法居留者。但大多数美国人认为 ICE 的策略太过分了。在最近几周，自 Renee Good 被杀以来，你开始看到并听到一些传统上支持政府的人开始质疑这些政策。Joe Rogan 将 ICE 比作盖世太保。Maria Bartiromo 在电视上就 Alex Prey 可能构成何种威胁质问 Cash Patel，考虑到他手里拿着的是相机而不是枪。所以，虽然很难推测接下来会发生什么，但我确实想知道，这次第二次杀戮事件是否在某种程度上让你觉得是一个转折点？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ernesto Londono**: Polls in this country show that most people are supportive of the Trump administration's stated goals of dealing with immigration by closing the border, enforcing deportations of people who are here illegally. But a majority of Americans think that ICE has gone too far in its tactics. And in recent weeks since the killing of Renee Good, you have started to see and hear people who have traditionally been supportive of the administration really question these policies. You had Joe Rogan basically compare ICE to the Gestapo. You had Maria Berto Romo pushing Cash Patel on television about what kind of threat Alex Prey could have possibly posed given the fact that he was holding a camera and not a gun. And so while it's incredibly hard to speculate of course about what comes next, I do wonder if the second killing feels like in any way a tipping point to you right now.

**Rachel Abrams**: 我认为此案中的视频具有独特的恐怖性。我还认为，根据过去 24 小时内涌入我收件箱的电子邮件，我们仍然是一个在移民问题上以及在对非法移民问题采取严厉回应的合理性上，存在严重分歧的国家。有些人认为这些行动是正当且受欢迎的。有很多人写信给我说，明尼阿波利斯那些被枪杀的人是罪有应得的，他们不应该干涉移民特工的工作，这应该给那些想挑战他们做法的人一个教训。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: I think the videos in this case are singularly horrifying. I also think just based on the kind of emails that have been streaming into my inbox over the past 24 hours that we remain a deeply divided country on the question of immigration and on the merits of a really draconian response to the problem of illegal immigration. There are people for whom these actions are not justified but welcome. There are many people who have written to me to say these people in Minneapolis who got gunned down had it coming. They shouldn't have been interfering with the work of immigration agents and let this be a lesson to other people who would want to challenge what they're doing.

**Ernesto Londono**: 对吧？我认为，关于这两个逝去生命的人，有趣的一点是，在某种程度上，他们是非常令人同情的。这位女士是三个孩子的母亲，一位诗人。嗯。而第二位受害者是一名护士，他照顾退伍军人。所以，我认为普通美国人很难接受“这两个在光天化日之下被枪杀的人符合国内恐怖分子的描述”这种说法。所以，我认为关键问题是，那些在这些问题上更温和、更容易被说服的选民群体，那些看到这些令人心痛的画面和视频后，会倾向于认为“这件事做得太过分了，政府需要被约束”的群体，他们会怎么做？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Ernesto Londono**: Right? I think one of the things that is really interesting about the two individuals whose lives were lost is on some level they're like deeply sympathetic figures. This woman was a mother of three and a poet. Mhm. And the second victim was a nurse who worked and took care of veterans. So, it feels hard, I think, for the average American to take this assertion that these two people who were gunned down in broad daylight fit the description of a domestic terrorist. So I think the key question is what happens to the segment of the electorate that is more moderate on these issues, that is more persuadable, and for whom these really searing images and videos are going to push them into the camp of thinking this has gone too far and that on some level the administration needs to be reigned in.

**Rachel Abrams**: Here's what else you need to know today. A dangerous winter storm pummeled much of the eastern United States on Sunday, shattering temperature records, knocking out power to more than a million homes and businesses, and wreaking havoc on daily life from Mississippi to Massachusetts. Five people were found dead in New York City over the weekend, and officials were investigating whether they died because of the cold. One person died of exposure in Austin, Texas, while the Louisiana Department of Health said two men had died of hypothermia. And Representative Maxwell Alejandro Frost, Democrat of Florida, was hit in the face by a man who told the lawmaker that he would be deported at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah over the weekend. The police said they responded to reports of an assault at the High West Saloon, a whiskey distillery and bar where a private party was being held. The attacker quote, "Told me that Trump was going to deport me before he punched me in the face," said Mr. Frost, whose family moved from Cuba to Florida in the early 1960s in a social media post.
