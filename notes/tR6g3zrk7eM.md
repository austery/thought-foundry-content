### 犯罪执法的社会影响

如果不对犯罪进行有效执法，最终会导致几代人的堕落。如果十年后我们发现所做的只是把大量人关进监狱，那实际上是双重糟糕。我们正在浪费人才，这可能是最糟糕的情况。因此，最好的做法是明确表示：“如果你犯罪，你就会被抓。”这会改变社会激励机制和文化。如果一个人可以通过犯罪赚取最低工资的十倍，而且在他所处的社区中，犯罪甚至没有社会污名，反而会受到尊敬，那么犯罪就变得太容易、太普遍了。这对于处于这种境地的人来说，是整个社会的失败。

If you don't enforce crime, what you end up is with lost generations. Yeah. If I woke up in 10 years and all we had done was put a lot of people in prison. It's actually double bad. Yeah. Well, we're throwing people away, right? Like, you know, that's the worst possible thing. So, the best thing is to say, hey, look, if you commit crimes, you're going to get caught. And then that kind of changes the societal incentives and the culture and everything else. I mean, look, if I can become a criminal and make like 10x what I can make in a minimum wage job as an entry thing, like, you know, like and then then in my neighborhood, it's not even like there's no social stigma with it. In fact, like you're looked up upon if you're a criminal. It's just too easy. Um, and it's just too much. It's a societal failure uh for everybody who's in that situation.

### 警察信任与隐私的平衡

在拉斯维加斯以外的地区，全国平均破案率约为47%，这意味着谋杀案有一半的几率逍遥法外。当那些不太熟悉技术的人批评我们时，我常常觉得好笑，因为如果联邦政府想找到你，车牌识别器是最笨的方法，他们可以直接获取你的手机数据，实时知道你的确切位置，而且这更有效。因此，我认为关于隐私的担忧是站不住脚的，但**信任**（Trust: 公众对执法机构的信心）问题却是真实存在的。有些社区根本不信任他们的警察部门。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Outside of Vegas, the national average is around 47% clearance rate. So, you have a coin flip for murder. You have a 53% chance of getting away with murder. Flip a coin. Flip a coin. Irony part is when we do get criticisms from people that are less familiar with technology, I laugh because I'm like, do your eyes. If the federal government wanted to find you, a license plate reader is the dumbest way to do it. I will just get a cell phone dump. Yeah. And I will know your exact location in real time. By the way, which is what they do. Yes. Because it's way more effective. So, I think for the privacy thing, it's it's quite it's quite false. The trust is real though. And so, if you go to some communities, they do not trust their police department. Yeah,

### 根除犯罪的综合策略：人员、产品与政策

主持人邀请嘉宾**Garrett Langley**（Flock Safety 创始人）和**Ben Horowitz**（知名风险投资家，Andreessen Horowitz 联合创始人）讨论美国如何通过多方面方法根除犯罪。**Garrett**建议从“人员、产品和政策”三个方面着手。在“人员”方面，他提出了一个新颖的想法：为了解决警力短缺问题，可以效仿“为美国而教”（Teach for America: 一个旨在吸引优秀大学毕业生到贫困地区教学的非营利项目）模式，为执法部门设立一个类似项目。例如，如果警员在社区服务两到四年，他们的助学贷款就可以免除。这不仅能解决警力危机和技能短缺，还能提升警察的社会地位。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Garrett, welcome to the podcast. Oh, thanks for having me. So, this group here is both is heavily invested in eliminating crime. Garrett, obviously you with Flock Safety and Ben, with your work in Las Vegas as well. Let's say that America declared a national goal to eliminate crime and we was taking a multiaceted approach and asked you Garrett to sit on a committee to help identify what are the different levers or what's what's the strategy the comprehensive strategy to eliminate crime. What would be some of your your main advice? Uh let's break it down in terms of uh people products and policy. Yeah. to people. Um, I saw a funny quote online that the way to solve uh our infertility issues is just to remove income tax once you have three kids. I was like, that's actually pretty novel. We have a massive student debt problem, right? Yeah. Why not create a Teach for America for law enforcement where you say, "Look, if you've got student debt and you go serve in your community for two years, four years as a patrol officer, crime analysts, like there's a ton of roles you can have in a police department, great. We'll retire student debt." So instead of just giving away for free, actually go work for your government. Wow. For two years and you don't have to go overseas and fight in a war. You can literally just stay at home and like that would dramatically fix the one of the biggest issues in policing which is a staffing crisis. Yeah. And and a skill set issue. So that's like the people side. That's the first thing I'd do. Um I'd go have like a national law enforcement act for staffing. Right. And also raise the status of police out there.

### 警力危机：文化污名与招聘困境

警力问题在很大程度上是文化问题。过去30年，人们对警察的看法发生了巨大转变，从“警察是英雄”到“彻底妖魔化警察”，甚至出现“削减警察经费”、“废除警察”的呼声。这种文化污名导致了警员提前退休人数飙升，尤其是在社会动荡和疫情期间，且至今未恢复。**Ben**认为，解决这种文化困境的唯一方法是让那些被债务困扰的人在经济上无法拒绝帮助社区，从而实现一种文化“重置”。由于警力短缺，许多警察部门不得不降低招聘标准，甚至在孟菲斯出现了雇佣罪犯当警察的情况，这导致了严重的后果，例如一起臭名昭著的谋杀案。这与**洛杉矶警察局**（LAPD: Los Angeles Police Department）在**罗德尼·金**（Rodney King: 1991年被洛杉矶警察殴打的非洲裔美国人，引发了大规模骚乱）事件后的“**城墙丑闻**”（Rampart Scandal: 洛杉矶警察局内部腐败丑闻）有异曲同工之处，当时他们也曾招募帮派成员，导致了更多犯罪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So how much how much of the people issue is the fact that we kind of went from a very kind of pro like police are heroes. every new show as a cop show to like complete vilification of the police, defund the police, abolish the police, abolish abolish cop shows. Yeah. Like they're all gone. They're all off the air. Um how much of it is cultural versus uh just a shortage of people that it's it's entirely cultural. Yeah. So, I mean, because you think about it, there's nothing has changed in the last 30 years that would indicate some percentage of people who were born and wanted to serve has changed. Only thing that's changed is the stigma attached to the job. And you can see that because if you look at the early retirement numbers, I mean, early retirement skyrocketed during both the social unrest and then co Yeah. And like they've never bounced back. Worst possible time. Yes. Worst possible time. So do you think Ben to your point like the only way I see to do a kind of cultural reset is to just make it financially impossible for people who are otherwise burdened by debt. Yeah. to go help their communities. Yeah, I think it's a that's an actually very important and underrated idea because one of the things that we've seen is that uh because of the shortage um many police departments have lowered their standards. So the the kind of criticism of the police was okay you have and and it really like if you looked into it there were some like psychos who joined the police force they couldn't get them out for whatever reason and then they do some heinous thing and it taints the whole police. Well, now because there aren't enough avail people are lowering standards to the point in Memphis where they started actually hiring criminals. Yes. And then there was a famous incident where the criminals just went and murdered a guy. Um, you know, and it was funny because or not funny, haha. But like I was showing it to the Vegas police, the the video of that incident and the first thing they said was, "Oh, that's not police brutality. They target they wanted they went to kill that guy like that. That that was a homicide." Yeah. And I was like, "Oh boy." But then you look into the backgrounds and the guys who committed the homicide were in fact criminals who got hired to be police. Which is also interestingly um what happened in the LAPD with the Rampart scandal right after the uh Rodney King incident. Um they they had the same kind of thing. Everybody got fired, etc., etc. They had trouble recruiting. They started recruiting people out of gangs. Um and those gang members ended up, you know, among other things, uh killing the notorious B.I. and this kind of thing. But, you know, people don't realize what the reaction to criticism. I think we just have to be, you know, looking forward careful about like, okay, what is the actual problem as opposed to police are bad. I think that gets that puts us in a very different kind of world that we don't want to be in.

### 拉斯维加斯的警务创新与形象提升

拉斯维加斯在警力招聘方面采取了极端措施，例如为警员购买住房、提供公务车等，以吸引人才。**Ben**提到，拉斯维加斯正通过引入**Flock Safety**（一家提供智能监控和车牌识别技术的公司）等技术和**特斯拉 Cybertruck**（Tesla Cybertruck: 特斯拉公司生产的电动皮卡）来改善警察形象，以促进招聘。拉斯维加斯拥有全国最高的退伍军人人口，有大量潜在的优秀警员，但提升形象至关重要。**Garrett**分享了一个趣闻，他父母的家乡小镇几年前购买了四辆特斯拉作为警车，警长表示所有18岁的年轻人因此都想加入警队。这表明，酷炫的科技装备对年轻人的吸引力巨大，有助于招聘。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Agree. And I think you're you're right when you look across the board. I think in the last year I've only been to one major city who seems to be like making a dent on staffing. Mhm. But it's like they've gone to such extremes. Like they b they'll buy you a house. Oh wow. You get a take-home car. Amazing. Like I mean it's always person like there's literally millions of people that could do this job. Just I don't think it's a cultural issue. Yeah. Yeah. No. I mean like a big thing in Vegas that we're doing is trying to kind of uh you know with flax safety and with some of the other technology we bought and the cyber trucks and so forth is to try and improve the image for recruiting because that's such a big thing and and we have the highest population in Las Vegas of uh veterans in like the whole country. Um, but we got so we have plenty of people who could be great police, but uh, you know, we have to kind of continue to improve the image. It's really funny you mentioned the Cybertruck because I know there was some like anything good in life criticism online. And it's funny because my uh, parents hometown where they still live uh, Mrs. Maybe like six years ago bought four Teslas for their fleet. Yeah. Yeah. And the chief was like, "Every single 18-year-old wants to drive his car. This is why I'm doing this." And like he was heavily applauded in that community cuz he's a very logical like marketing boy like get I mean these are a bunch of 18 and 20-y old men. Like they like shiny toys like a cool ass cool looking truck. Yeah. If your choice is like driving, you know, Toyota Camry or fire truck like what makes it feel cool?

</details>

### 科技提升警务形象与社区互动

尽管**Cybertruck**在网上受到一些批评，但它们对警队招聘起到了很好的作用。**Ben**提到，**TechCrunch**曾将他描绘成拉斯维加斯的“犯罪头目企鹅”，认为他捐赠**Cybertruck**是为了收买警察。然而，事实是人们非常喜欢这些卡车，自从引入它们以来，社区活动中要求警车出现的请求数量激增，因为它们看起来很酷。甚至连曾创作歌曲《**F*** the Police**》的著名音乐人**Dr. Dre**也主动要求与警员和**Cybertruck**合影。这表明科技不仅能提升警务形象，还能促进警民关系。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Well, the Cybert trucks they have been great for recruiting despite the the criticism that I got. Um, so they the uh well actually Techrunch um portrayed me as uh the penguin that I'm like a crime boss in Las Vegas and I'm making these donations in order to like to pay off Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. to pay off the police to do my you know like evil evil bidding your evil because Yeah. Because like Andrea Horitz is not a good enough business. I need to be in whatever the the crime ring in Vegas is. Uh, so yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But but they do like and people love them. And interestingly since we got the trucks um the number of requests for just like them appearing at community events is off the charts because they look so cool. And in fact when we did Paid in Full, uh Dr. Dre, you know, famous for, you know, the song [ __ ] the Police saw the Cybertruck parked out front and took a picture with the cops in front of the cyber truck at his request. Yeah. Yeah. That's gross. So, so that's people.

</details>

### 科技产品在犯罪预防中的应用

在“产品”方面，拉斯维加斯拥有先进的技术栈。针对枪支暴力问题，需要**枪声探测器**（Gunshot Detection: 能够自动识别并定位枪声的技术），因为大多数枪支暴力事件不会被报告。此外，无人机和摄像头也至关重要。这些传感器产生了大量数据，因此需要**人工智能**（AI: Artificial Intelligence: 模拟人类智能的计算机系统）层和**编排层**（Orchestration Layer: 协调和管理多个系统或服务的软件层）来处理和理解这些数据。第三个关键点是确保问责制和透明度，因为警察部门是为纳税人服务的，公众有权知道资金如何使用，以及执法是否符合社会公正。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Yeah. Then products. I think Vegas is a good We can pick on Vegas because they've got a pretty good technology stack. Um, you got to go crime by crime. So, gun if you have a gun violence problem, which Vegas has some, you need gunshot detection to know, you know, majority of gun violence does not build a report. Like, if I shoot you, yeah, I'm not going to call 911 myself. Unfortunately, I have a good shot. So, you're not call 911 either. So, that's a problem. Um, you have drones like Vegas has a great deployment of drones. San Francisco does as well as you saw in the news. So, you need drones. uh you need cameras. So you've got all these sensors, right? And then what's missing historically is now this AI layer and this orchestration layer on top to say, "Wow, I've gone from no data to an abundance of data. How do I make sense of it?" Um so we've got that. And then this third piece that we care a lot about is how do you also do this in a way that provides accountability and transparency? Because at the end of the day, the police department works for us taxpaying citizens and you want to know how's your money being used? it's being done in a way that's kind of society just and and forward. So that's the product side and then policy is you have to hold people accountable. Yeah. I mean we've seen the social experiment and and parts of right you need you need to actually prosecute the crime and you know it's it's seemingly straightforward but a lot of the times we decriminalize things that should be criminal and that causes a problem. So that's what I would do if I was in charge.

</details>

### 犯罪执法的选择：严惩与智能

在“政策”方面，必须追究犯罪者的责任。我们看到一些社会实验，部分地区将本应是犯罪的行为“非刑事化”，这导致了问题。在犯罪问题上，选择并不多：要么是大量犯罪，要么是严厉的惩罚（如新加坡模式的严酷刑罚），要么是**智能警务**（Intelligence-led Policing: 基于数据和分析来指导警务行动的策略）。智能警务能让所有人更安全，因为它让每个人都了解犯罪情况，并大大提高犯罪者被捕的可能性。正如中国古语所说：“**刑罚确定，则无刑罚**”（Certain Punishment Means No Punishment: 意指刑罚若能确定执行，则能有效震慑犯罪，减少实际刑罚的需要）。在美国，减少犯罪的唯一途径是更好的智能警务。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Yeah. And I think like one of the things that people don't think through when they think about crime um is like like the you don't have that many choices. You have kind of a choice of lots of crime or if you're going to prevent crime, there's kind of the Singaporean model which is very harsh capital punishment. You know, we'll hang you in the town square, we'll hit you with a cane, we'll lock you in like an El Salvadorian prison. um or uh intelligence. Uh and in what intelligence does is it um basically makes everybody safer. It makes the suspect safer. It makes the police safer because now everybody understands the crime situation. And then you're also much likely much more likely to get caught. And there's an old Chinese saying that says certain punishment means no punishment. And that is the the only way that you can actually achieve it in the US uh reduction in crime is better intelligence. And you know people say well root cause um you know like if we get rid of all poverty and this and that and the third well yeah sure if you create a utopian society which nobody's ever done and like uh the people have tried it's been much more brutal and many more people killed than in societies that don't go for utopia. Yeah, but like in reality, you just kind of have to deal with the situation as it is, I think. And by the way, nobody pays more attention to how policing works than criminals, like more than anybody. Uh they know exactly what the policies are, what the technology is, when police change shifts, all that kind of thing. And so if you do have great law enforcement, um then you're very likely to discourage crime.

</details>

### 犯罪的职业路径与社会成本

犯罪分子比任何人都更关注警务运作方式，他们清楚政策、技术以及警察换班时间。因此，强大的执法力量能够有效遏制犯罪。**Garrett**提到，说唱歌手**The Game**曾在一首歌中唱道：“真正的帮派成员在警察换班时上街。”这反映了犯罪分子对执法漏洞的了解。**Flock Safety**的产品甚至被南加州的匪帮说唱歌曲提及，要求“远离**Flock**”，这被视为一种文化上的重要成就。如果一个人在体制外成长，犯罪是其最可行的谋生方式，那么犯罪就成了一条职业道路。削弱执法力量，实际上是在为犯罪创造职业道路，并避免为这些人提供真正的职业选择，从而产生一系列负面连锁反应。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

What was that quote that you mentioned just before the Oh, yeah. Well, the the game had a uh a song where he said, you know, real gangsters hit the streets when police change shifts, which is Yeah. Like, of course. But I mean, to your point on on on that, like I'll never forget maybe in 2022, there was a rap song released uh in Southern California with reference to flock and that had got flocks to stay away. And I was like, we've made it. We made it. Like this is really important culturally. Yeah. It's a key KPI to keep track of. Yeah, I think that's right. And then you know like it's uh if you grow up it's very important like if you think about like if you're growing up outside of the system um and the most viable way to make a living is crime then you know that is a career path. And so by reducing law enforcement you create a crime career path and it kind of lets us avoid creating real career paths for people in that situation. And so it's a cascading effect of just badness.

</details>

### 监狱成本与社会再融入的挑战

如果十年后我们只是把大量人关进监狱，那将是双重糟糕的局面。监狱本身成本高昂，而且被监禁的人不再是社会的生产力。我们正在“抛弃”这些人。最低刑期等政策使得人们很难在出狱后重新融入社会。他们的人生会留下污点，无法租房、无法获得枪支、无法投票、无法找到工作。这可能是最糟糕的情况。因此，最好的做法是让犯罪者明确知道他们会被抓捕，这会改变社会激励和文化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Well, I think to your point too, the when if I woke up in 10 years and all we had done was put a lot of people in prison, it's actually double bad because now prison's already very expensive, right? There's an economic cost of now that person's no longer productive in society. Like, yeah, well, we're throwing people away, right? like you know with the minimum sentencing and everything you know it's very hard to go to prison and come out then you have this black mark on your on your life where you can't get an apartment you you know you can't get a gun you can't vote uh you can't get a job and you know that's the worst possible thing. So the best thing is to say hey look if you commit crimes you're going to get caught. Um and then that kind of changes the societal incentives and the culture and everything else.

</details>

### 威慑与惩罚：科技的作用

通过先进的技术部署，例如**Flock Safety**的全面系统，执法部门无需大肆宣传，因为“街头在看着你”，犯罪分子会知道他们会被抓。如果不强制执行法律，最终会导致几代人的堕落。如果一个人可以通过犯罪赚取最低工资的十倍，并且在他们的社区中，犯罪没有社会污名，反而受到尊敬，那么犯罪就变得过于容易，这是整个社会的失败。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Totally agree. Are we doing sort of the wrong thing by making it not clear that you're going to get caught or or saying that sort of making it not the deterrence not 100% um you know uh as clear as it should be while sort of arbitrarily doing long prison sentences instead? Yeah. I mean I think that like if you have great technology, if you've got a kind of a comprehensive flock deployment, then what happens is like you don't have to advertise it. Yeah. because like the streets are watching. They know what to to quote Jay-Z like that's that's going to happen. Um, but if yeah, if you don't enforce crime, what you end up is with lost generations. Uh, because you like like it's a pretty I mean, look, if I can um become a criminal and make like 10x what I can work make in a minimum wage job as an entry thing, like you know, like and then then in my neighborhood, it's not even like there's no social stigma with it. In fact, like you're looked up upon if you're a criminal. It's just too easy. Um, and it's just too much. It's a societal failure uh for everybody who's in that situation.

</details>

### 削减警力与预防性服务的误解

对于那些主张“削减警察经费”并将资金转用于心理健康服务或其他预防性服务的人，**Garrett**认为这是一种对激励机制的误解。激励机制驱动文化。如果取消执法，在一个异质社会中，缺乏足够强大的道德结构来让人们认识到抢劫、贩毒等行为是错误的。社会工作者可以劝导人们不要犯罪，但如果犯罪有强大的经济诱因，这种劝导效果甚微。我们已经进行了这种实验，结果并不奏效。社会工作者无法处理正在发生的抢劫、谋杀或暴力犯罪。这些并非互斥，两者可以并行。在一些城市，偷车等行为甚至没有社会污名，这无法通过增加社会工作在一夜之间改变。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Well, on that note, what do you say to people who say, "Hey, we weren't advocating for defund the police. We were saying redirect that money to, you know, group therapy or sort of, you know, mental health, you know, or other services that are more preventive. Let's what would you say to that argument?" It's just like a misunderstanding of incentives, I think, right? Like incentives drive culture. If you get rid of law enforcement, then look, we don't have a strong enough consistent we're a heterogeneous society, ethical kind of structure to make people go, okay, like you know, robbing somebody is bad or or for sure like selling drugs is bad or bookmaking or or whatever the crime is. like a lot of people don't even know that's a crime um you know until they're much older and so forth. So like it's not viable to, you know, stop crime with a big incentive. Like yeah, you can go talk to somebody as a social worker and say, "Hey, you shouldn't do that." But like if they go, "Well, look, I have a very strong cash incentive to do it." Yeah. Then like how is that going to work? So you have to have I'm not against social work but you can't do it at the expense of crime enfor you you know law enforcement and we saw that I mean like we ran the experiment it didn't work um you know and and I think people would say well we didn't hire enough social workers but you know like social workers can't deal with a like a robbery or murder or rape or like a you know violent crime in progress and these are not mut mutually exclusive you can do both. No, no, I was gonna say to V's point, there is a in some parts of the country, cities, whole cities, there isn't a stigma in doing something like stealing a car. Yeah. And you don't just change that overnight with more social work. And I think like I've seen programs at least where, you know, they their phrase is more, you know, at promise versus at risk programs where it's like if you don't want to get in this cycle, create that path, but you still actually have to fix the root problem, which is you should be held accountable if you steal someone's car.

</details>

### 智能警务与社区信任的重建

**Dr. Dre**从过去创作《**F*** the Police》到现在与警察合影，反映了社区对警务态度的转变。过去的**洛杉矶警察局**在毒品战争时期非常激进，采取“先暴力后提问”的文化，导致了社区的不信任。然而，解决这种警务模式的答案是**智能警务**加上**社区警务**（Community Policing: 警察与社区居民合作解决犯罪和公共安全问题的方法）。**Ben**举例说明，在引入无人机和**Flock**系统之前，警察可能会错误地拦截无辜市民，导致警民冲突。而有了精确的摄像头数据，警察可以准确识别嫌疑人，派遣团队安全逮捕，避免不必要的冲突，从而在社区中建立信任关系。拉斯维加斯拥有全国最高的谋杀案破案率（超过90%），这得益于社区警务，因为当谋杀案发生时，总有人知道是谁干的，而社区警务能让他们愿意向警方提供信息。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

It was interesting you brought up the the sort of Dr. you know, [ __ ] the police. Now, taking a photo with with police because some people say, "Hey, hiphop at times is glorified a certain, you know, crime um lifestyle." Are other people sort of evolving like Dr. Dre has or how how is sort of the community um you know, over time you thought about sort of this? Well, look, I think that um there so [ __ ] the police uh had a real basis in it in that there was like if you look at the LAPD in that era um they you know and this was the drug war era they were like very very very aggressive and it was you know brutalize first like ask questions second you know kind of culture of that police force. So, he was making a real comment on a real thing. Um, you know, an ice cube and so forth. Um, but the answer to that kind of policing is intelligence plus community policing, right? Like like that's the right way to police. You need and I I give you an example. So, what the Vegas uh police say said, you know, kind of if you look at it before the drone program, before flock. Okay. So, if you don't have flock, what happens? you get a call, there's a, you know, 1988 Toyota Corolla, uh, that was stolen, um, and, you know, it's blue and it's driving, you know, this way. Okay. So, then a guy gets pulled over over, not the right guy. Um, I'm getting pulled over for the police. They're highly suspicious. They're nervous. Um, and I'm like, whatever. I'm a black man, so I'm already like trained to be wary of this. And so now you can have an incident. Whereas and and if it's a flat camera, you know that's the guy that is the guy. And so now you're not sending in one police officer because you know it's the guy. You're sending in a team. You're going to apprehend them safely. Uh you know at you're going to take your time because you know like you don't have to move on to the next one. it's a totally different situation. And then you can start to build relationships in the community because you're not like falsely arresting people and that kind of thing. And so if you look at, you know, Vegas has the highest murder clearance rate in the country, well over 90%. Why is that? You talk to them, it's because anytime a murder is committed, somebody knows who did it. And in most cities, they don't talk to the police. Um, and so by doing community policing, they're able to get that information. and they're able to clear the murders. They're able to make the community safer. And mostly, by the way, people should understand this. The victims of crime are poor people by and large, you know, and so when you go defund the police, we're not going to enforce law. You're basically terrorizing the poor community.

### 犯罪破案率下降的原因

削减警察经费实际上是在恐吓贫困社区，导致犯罪率上升，这被称为“**弗格森效应**”（Ferguson Effect: 指在某些地区，对警察的批评和审查增加后，警察执法减少，导致犯罪率上升的现象）。犯罪破案率下降有几个原因。积极的一面是，社会对逮捕犯罪者的期望提高了，例如DNA和视频证据的出现，使得将人终身监禁变得更加困难，这是好事。然而，负面原因包括：**证人合作意愿降低**，因为作证可能危及自身安全；**犯罪类型发生转变**，过去多数是家庭内部犯罪，现在多数是随机的毒品交易或帮派冲突，解决难度更大；**证据量激增**，但警方的技能和技术未能跟上，例如拉斯维加斯有数万个摄像头，但需要人工搜索和整合，而目前还没有足够的人工智能技术来自动处理；最后是**警力短缺**，经验丰富的侦探提前退休，新招募的年轻警员缺乏处理复杂案件的经验。因此，除了拉斯维加斯，全国平均谋杀案破案率仅为47%，这意味着53%的谋杀案逍遥法外。

<details>

And this is what was called the Ferguson effect, right? Like crime actually went up. Yeah. No, of course. Of course it did. And it and it's uh you know, people just don't think these systematic problems all the way through. They they just go to the very first thing like police are bad. Yeah. Well, like the system hasn't been working so let's fix the system as opposed to vilify any individual. Yeah. Garrett, can you say more about why sort of the I don't know if it's the clear clearance rate or just the sort of rate at which we catch you murders or or solve crimes has has been dropping and and you know Yeah. Well, I think I'll provide one positive reason why clearance rates are down and the rest is very negative. On a positive side, our expectations of a society to arrest someone have gone up, which is which is good, right? I think a the number of people who you hear about getting released 10 years later because now we have DNA or 10 years later because now we have video events. Like that's actually a good thing, right? It should be harder to put someone in jail for life. Yeah, that's one reason, right? Like that's that's a good thing. Like and some of that's from TV, you know, you watch NCIS NCIS and you're just like there's cameras everywhere kind of. Yeah. So, that's the one. The second is, and and Ben mentioned this, witness cooperation is gone. I mean, what's the personal benefit of testifying in a homicide besides putting your own life at risk? Yeah. So, so no one shows up, which is a huge problem. Um, society, we've given up on pretending like we're going to help you. So, that's the second issue. Third issue is a pretty big mix shift in crime. So, if you think about the 60s, 70s, 80s, majority of crime was domestic. you you would kill a partner, you would kill a girlfriend or boyfriend. So, it was it was not randomized crime. Now, the majority of homicides are random. Um it is a drug deal gone gone wrong. It is a gang rivalry over territory. That is the predominant type of crime. That is way harder to solve because if it if it was a traditional type, you go, "Okay, let's check the family. Great. We're done. Case closed." So fourth one um the amount of evidence has gone up in a positive way but faster than both skill set and technology has kept pace. So even though let's pick on Vegas has hundreds probably thousands tens of thousands of cameras. You got to go search them. You got to go put it together like that doesn't just and now like AI is nobody's watching the camera. No one's watching them, right? And like we can look at recent events where you know there have been these you know shootings on college campuses and they're like why don't they find them faster? There's thousands of cameras. I'm like the the technology is not there yet. Now Flock has some tools to help with that but we're not deployed everywhere. And the last one which we hit on was just staffing. We talked about early retirement. Yeah. So even though let's pick on Atlanta. Atlanta is was at a low was at 60% staffed. They're now up to 75 80. That gap is all 21 year olds. Yeah. They have no idea how to solve a homicide. They will in 20 years. But so you your seasoned experienced detectives have all retired. Wow. And so it's this compounding effect where it doesn't look pretty good. And that's why you know outside of Vegas the national average is around 47% clearance rate. So you have a coin flip for murder. You have a 53% chance of getting away with murder. Flip a coin. Flip a coin. Yeah. And you got to imagine if you're if you're, you know, upper cortile, you should get away with it forever. Wow. Yep. Um sorry to bring the moods down.

### 警务“为美国而教”计划的可行性

**Garrett**提出的“为警务而教”计划（Teach for America for Policing: 借鉴“为美国而教”模式，通过免除学生贷款等激励措施吸引大学毕业生加入执法部门）是可行的。如果能解决学生债务问题，这个计划的推行并不需要太多额外投入。最大的改变在于，目前的警员培训通常需要52周才能上岗，这太慢了。而“为美国而教”的培训可能只有四到八周。对于受过大学教育的人来说，他们能够很快适应。警务工作有不同的期望，因此可以设立更多的**文职岗位**（Civilian Jobs: 由非宣誓警务人员承担的行政、技术或支持性工作），不需要接受警校培训，也不需要持枪。**Garrett**认为，一个主要城市只需要创造200个需要大学学位和两年承诺的入门级警务岗位，这个计划就相当可行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Yeah. the I I do love your sort of teach for America but for policing idea for people who are listening who are inspire like what would it take for that to get off the ground like well if you remove the like debt grievance part actually not that that much I think the biggest change is if you look at to today um and I don't you could debate whether this is important or not you typically are looking at almost 52 weeks of training before you get out in the field that's too slow you know I think teacher America does probably what, like a four or eight week program? I don't actually know, but it's probably pretty quick. Yeah. I mean, you're college educated. You're going to figure it out. Yeah. Policing has a different expectation. So, I would continue to see uh more either civilian jobs, which some agencies are doing, where they're just creating different entire departments for civilians, and then in that case, there's no academy. You also don't have a gun, which is fine, right? Um, but I think that's actually like it's actually not much to pull it off. I think it just takes a major city, most likely needs to be a major city to say, I'm going to create 200 entry- level jobs. You requires a college degree, it's two-year commitment, and you know, I think it's pretty doable. Talk to a mayor about it.

### 科技警务提升安全与效率

随着警务力量变得更加高科技，对于大学毕业生和受过高等教育的人来说，警务工作会变得更有吸引力，因为它改变了警务的性质。当拥有全面的**智能警务**时，每个人的安全都能得到极大提升。例如，拉斯维加斯在部署摄像头和无人机后，警察枪击嫌疑人的事件下降了75%。这是因为警察不再处于未知危险的境地，他们了解犯罪情况，有足够警力，从而避免了危险局面，也减少了**军事化警务**（Militarized Police: 警察部门采用军事装备、战术和文化）的必要性，这并非可持续的模式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Yeah. And I do think that as police uh forces get much higher tech, I I think it gets much more interesting too for uh college graduates and people with higher education and so forth because uh it just changes the nature of what policing is. Um, you know, when you have full intelligence, then I I can't overemphasize how much safer everybody is. Yeah. Um, like police shootings of suspects in Vegas dropped like 75% when we first put the the cameras and the drones in place. Just because you're you're not in this weird unknown situation where you don't know, you know, if they have a gun, you have a gun, there's not enough police around. All that kind of thing just makes for extremely dangerous situation. and you know we have a and this is how you end up with this like militarized police uh situation which you know is not a very sustainable idea.

### 拉斯维加斯模式：社区接受度与公私合作

拉斯维加斯的警务模式最令人惊讶之处在于社区的接受度。尽管媒体存在“**监控**”（Surveillance: 持续观察和记录个人活动以收集信息）和“**老大哥**”（Big Brother: 指政府或权力机构对民众进行无处不在的监控和控制）的批评，但当地居民，尤其是服务业工作者，非常喜欢这种模式。拉斯维加斯是一个独特的城市，存在“犯罪旅游”现象，许多人专程来此犯罪。但对于当地居民来说，强大的警务部门和先进的技术让他们感到自豪和安全。他们知道在拉斯维加斯可以犯罪，但无法逍遥法外。这种模式在全国范围内也越来越受欢迎，即**公私合作**（Public-Private Partnership: 政府与私营部门合作提供公共服务或基础设施的模式）。政府创新速度慢，而私营企业或个人有共同的激励机制来提升安全。例如，**家得宝**（Lowe's: 一家大型家居建材零售商）是**莫里斯维尔警察局**（Morrisville Police Department）最大的支持者，因为其总部设在那里，有数千名员工居住在当地。**家得宝**投入一百万美元，对警察部门来说是小数目，却能彻底改变警务。

Let's go deeper on Vegas as a as a case study. Ben, what has most surprised you in your in your work um with Vegas or or what do you think other cities can learn from the the work that you guys are doing? Well, I think that the most surprising thing is to to me is just like how much the actual community likes it. Like we've got criticism in the press and and whatnot of course you know surveillance big brother like Ben's a penguin all that kind of thing. Uh but the community, you know, everybody who lives there and Vegas is kind of a unique city in that like it's got crime tourism. Yeah. People fly in. Yeah. Let's do some crime and then fly out and all that kind of thing. And then there's like a lot of people go bananas. Yeah. Uh in Vegas. So it's it's way beyond any criminal motivation. that's like mental health and and that kind of thing or mental health combined with like hard drugs combined with, you know, Vegas. Uh so, so there's a lot of that and but for the people who live there, you know, the all the hospitality workers, you know, the people who are working for tips and all that kind of thing. Um the fact that you know when we already had a very good police department in terms of community policing and the right um you know the right culture you know adding the technology to that has kind of made the community go wow like I am I'm proud to be here. I feel safe. I know that if a crime gets committed and we always say in the like you can commit a crime in Vegas you can't get away with it. Um and people really really appreciate that. I've gotten, you know, so many people come up to me from all over the city saying, "Hey, thank you. We really see the difference and appreciate what you're doing and so forth." So, I I didn't think it would be that visible that fast. I think the other thing, too, and you I don't know if you actually know this, but the model of of what Vegas is doing is caught on more nationally where this public private partnership is picking up speed because the pace of government innovation is quite slow. Yeah. in private enterprise, whether it's an individual or a company, has mutual incentives to be safer. So, think about like who's the largest supporter of the Morrisville Police Department, Lowe's, because Lowe's is based there. Yeah. And they have thousands of employees that live there. And so, to for Lowe's to spend a million dollars, it's very small for them, but can transform that police department. And like more cities are waking up to like there's a better way to run a city.

### 城市预算与微小投资的巨大影响

对于像拉斯维加斯警察局这样拥有数千名警员和庞大预算的机构来说，进行技术上的边际投资非常困难，因为官僚程序繁琐，预算固定，他们不愿意为了技术而裁员。警务预算几乎全部用于人员开支。然而，只需在警察预算中增加不到1%的资金，就能彻底改变警务力量。例如，911报警中心曾面临严重的员工流失问题，培训一名接线员需要12个月，工作压力巨大，导致电话等待时间长达五分钟。通过投资购买制冰机、咖啡机和健身房等小设施，现在电话等待时间已缩短至30秒以内。在亚特兰大，警察基金会每年向警察部门捐赠约3000万美元。**SWAT**（Special Weapons And Tactics: 特警队）负责人曾表示需要新的装备，而他们的现有装备令人尴尬。只需一百万美元就能为**SWAT**团队更新所有装备，这对于城市来说是合乎逻辑但难以实现的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

So, this is so important because if you look at the Vegas PD, it's like, well, they've got like, I don't know, thousands of officers. They've got, you know, huge budget in this and that and the other. But can they make the marginal investment in technology? Absolutely not. Um, it's very, very difficult. It's extremely bureaucratic. The budget is fixed. Um, you know, they don't want to have to lay off people to do it. And it's mostly headcount, right? Yeah. And it's Yeah, it's mostly it's almost all headcount. And so by just like adding like less than a percent to the police budget, you can completely transform the police force. It's it's pretty amazing. Uh and uh you know, it's very rewarding work. I mean, just like little things. So we had a tremendous attrition problem in the 911. 911's a very stressful job. It takes 12 months to train somebody. It's all this kind of thing. Um, and you know, they everybody was quitting. They five minute call waits for 911. Imagine waiting on hold for five minutes on 911. Um, and you know, I I was like, "Well, what's the problem?" And they're like, "Well, you know, like the work conditions are hard. Like, there's no ice machine." Like, that was literally that. So, I was like, "Fuck that. I'll buy that." So, I bought an ice machine, an espresso machine. We put in a gym. Um, and now the call weights are less than 30 seconds. And so, you know, just like that tiny investment uh can change everything. But I think to your point, like uh in Atlanta, um I'm on the police foundation board. I think we contribute about $30 million a year to the police department. Yeah. And I'll never forget this is a couple months ago, the head of the like SWAT team came in. Yeah. And was like, I would like new equipment. I'm thinking, yeah, how bad can it be? And he walks in and it's like, I mean, you would be embarrassed. And it's like your job is actually to go into fire like line of fire. It's like he was like I would like a million dollars to get all new equipment for our SWAT team. It's like this is like very logical but it is hard when you're a city. You have no flexibility in your budget. You have no ability to react.

### 公私合作在城市安全中的推广潜力

城市普遍面临巨大的预算压力，许多城市多年来一直在寅吃卯粮，负债累累，还要支付高额养老金，因此很难改变城市预算。然而，对于公司或个人而言，相对较少的资金就能带来巨大的改变。这种模式是否能在拉斯维加斯以外的城市推广？例如在旧金山，有多少公司愿意出资让员工每天上班更安全？**Garrett**表示，旧金山的所有最新警务创新都是100%由私人资助的。虽然这些公司选择保持低调，但**旧金山警察局**的**实时犯罪中心**（Real Time Crime Center: 整合各种数据源和技术，为执法人员提供实时犯罪信息和分析的中心）由**Flock**提供技术支持，参观者通常会惊叹并愿意捐款，因为他们希望自己的社区也能拥有无人机和更多摄像头。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

It's it's just it's a it's a and cities in general right are under tremendous budget. You know most of them have run programs for years borrowing from the future. They're highly in debt. um you know, they've got big pensions to pay off, so it's really hard to change a city budget. It it seems like relatively small amounts of of money for for for these companies or individuals can can make a massive difference. Is is this repeatable in cities, you know, beyond Vegas and um and like in San Francisco, how how many companies would pay money to make it safer for their employees to to come into the office every day? I hope a lot. Yeah. As soon as as soon as people see it, they want to do it. Like people just don't know that's possible. Um they're like what? I can give money to the police. So I mean so if you look at all of the latest innovations Yeah. in San Francisco 100% private funded. Really? 100%. Now they're choosing to stay, you know, as quiet as they can. But I know Yeah. In San Look, you know, look, we don't want a repeat of of Penguin Biden. So like you don't Well, let's get a coalition. If I was if I was donating in San Francisco, I would stay quiet as well. Yeah. Well, hey, it is interesting. I mean, for anyone listening, you should go tour the San Francisco Police Department's Real Time Crime Center. It's powered by Flock. And I guarantee you will walk away and you will say, "Where do I sign a check to give?" Yeah. Because you want a drone in your neighborhood. You want more cameras in your neighborhood. Like, this is the way to do it.

### 科技警务的争议与信任问题

**Flock Safety**每年协助逮捕约一百万名罪犯，并且确保逮捕的是正确的人。这对于美国来说意义重大，因为许多人，尤其是在错误社区或因错误原因被捕的无辜者，面临着巨大的悲剧。**Flock**的**人工智能**匹配技术确保了逮捕的准确性，这带来了巨大的文化冲击，将警务从主观判断转变为客观证据。**Flock**主要面临的批评是关于隐私问题，但**Garrett**认为这种关注是错误的。**Flock**的摄像头都安装在公共场所，你在公共场所做的事情，任何拿着手机的人都可能侵犯你的隐私。联邦政府如果想找到你，会直接获取你的手机数据，而不是通过车牌识别器。因此，隐私问题是虚假的，真正的问题是**信任**。如果社区不信任警察部门，他们就不希望警察拥有枪支或技术，甚至希望警察离开。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

How much do we have to pay for the Xi homeless, you know, program when he comes? It's a million dollars. Yeah. Right. Right. They literally raise taxes for this is such a tiny amount of money uh compared to those sorts of. Wow. And and then just to close the loop on it, what we typically see too and and this is the same in Vegas is the expectation is like the first year two years are covered and then the city has to decide do you want to keep it and you roll it into a budget because with enough notice they can afford all these products. It's just hard to get started. Yeah. As we said earlier, no good deed goes unpunished and flock hasn't been uh you know exempt from that because of all the great work that you've done you know solving a huge is it like 20% of do about a million arrests this year. So what are what are the criticism that you get for and and and I just want to point out arrest of the right person. Yes. Like this is such a big thing in America like the number of people who you know particularly if you live in the wrong neighborhood, if you look the wrong way and so forth and get like arrested for the wrong crime or arrested or totally innocent um has been just like a massive problem because you just one of those is a complete tragedy. So the fact that they've arrested a million of the correct people with like a perfect AI match is really really significant. It is a it is a cultural shock to a police department when you go from subjectivebased policing to objectivebased policing like Ben's describing. Um so look I think we get predominantly criticized for privacy which I I find uh falsely focused. I don't think there's any privacy erosion in Flock. Um I think Flock puts a spotlight on trust issues. And so I'll give you a good example. And and by the way, the the Flock cameras are all in public spaces. Yeah. Yeah. And it's so whatever you're doing in public, somebody probably has a phone and is really invading your privacy if you say the the ironic part is when we do get criticisms from people that are less familiar with technology. I laugh because I'm like do your eyes. If the federal government wanted to find you, a license plate reader is the dumbest way to do it. I will just get a cell phone dump. Yeah. And I will know your exact location in real time at all times, by the way, which is what they do. Yes. But that's way more effective. Uh that's so you know there are going to solve that. So I think for the privacy thing it's it's quite it's quite false. The trust is real though. And so if you go to some communities, they do not trust their police department.

### 削减警力：对贫困社区的伤害

**Flock Safety**通过透明度页面，让公众了解他们如何使用技术，从而帮助建立信任。一些人担心警察缺乏信任会导致私人安保的盛行。然而，“削减警察经费”的讽刺之处在于，它实际上是削减了贫困人口的警力，而富人则可以享受私人安保。这在许多国家都失败了，也不是一个好主意。犯罪的98%受害者是贫困人口。如果取消对贫困人口的公共警务资金，最终会导致一个完全堕落的社会，将整个社区变成“第三世界”，这在美国以非常严重的方式存在。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Yeah. And that's what this highlights because if you don't trust your police department, you don't want them to have guns, you don't want them to have technology, you want them to go away. And so there are some communities where that trust is just is just deeply fissured and we're not going to fix it. Like I don't think that's our job. We're not we're just highlighting it. So typically when we see critics, you know, they they call it privacy, but that's just a cover for I don't trust the police to do their job effectively. And so what we try to do, at least in our tools, is build those levers so that if you're in, you know, Piedmont, California, and you can go to their transparency page and see why are they using Flock, how are they using it, what are they doing, like that's actually I think that's good in building more and more trust. Yeah. Yeah. It seems like some people are scared about a world in which there's so little trust in in the police that basically everyone is getting private security, you know, all these neighborhood um Well, that's the irony of defund the police. It's defund the police for poor people. It's privatized the police for rich people. Yeah. Which, you know, has failed in many countries. Yeah. And it's a not a good idea by the way. No, no, no. Yeah. And and and say more about why that is. The crimes are committed like 98% against poor people. Like that is who are the victims of crime. And so you take away the public funding of police for poor people. Um then you basically end up with a completely degenerate society. You basically turn whole neighbors in into the third world which we by the way have in the United States in a really major way. Uh and you know you just have to put yourself in the position of somebody who is trying to raise kids in that environment. It is crazy that that happens in this country. It's just absolutely insane.

### 经济流动性与安全基石

美国的核心前提是**经济流动性**（Economic Mobility: 个人或家庭在经济阶梯上向上或向下移动的能力），即希望比父母过得更好，希望孩子比自己过得更好。要实现这一点，需要三样东西：食物、住所和安全。如果生活中没有安全的基石，其他一切都无法实现。整个心思都会被“我能安全走到学校吗？”、“我能活到18岁或21岁吗？”这些问题占据。通过警务私有化，就剥夺了经济流动性的核心支柱，这导致人们开始不相信“美国梦”，认为它对自己不起作用。这是一个巨大的问题，我们面临着一代孩子不相信美国会为他们服务的风险。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Yeah. I mean, if you look at the core premise of America, it's economic mobility. Yeah. I want to do better than my parents. I want my kids to do better than me. You have to have three things to do that. You have to have food, right? And to Ben's point on on privatizing, like you look at one of the biggest issues in poor communities, it's a lack of sourced food. Second is you have to have a shelter. Okay. Third is you have to be safe. If you don't have a bedrock of safety in your life, nothing else can be done. Nothing. Everything will o your entire mind becomes occupied by can I actually walk to school? Yeah. Will I make it to 18 years old 21? And so if you look at that you go by privatizing you remove a core tenant of economic mobility which is what you see politically politically where we start to say I don't believe in the American dream anymore because it's it didn't work for me. And that's I think the fundamental risk is actually like that that we have a generation of of kids who don't think America will work for them. Yeah. And that's I think that's actually a huge problem.

### 监狱改革与犯罪预防的独立性

98%的犯罪是针对贫困人口的，而且是由极少数人实施的。关于如何处理这部分人，人们谈论**刑事司法改革**（Criminal Justice Reform: 旨在改善刑事司法系统公平性、效率和效果的政策和实践），有时主张不将罪犯关进监狱，而是让他们自由。**Ben**认为，监狱改革是一个独立的问题。美国的监狱系统存在很多问题，主要是完全偏离了**改造**（Rehabilitation: 帮助罪犯改过自新，重新融入社会的过程）目标。美国的**累犯率**（Recidivism Rate: 刑满释放人员在一定时间内再次犯罪的比例）超过70%，而做得更好的国家可以低于40%。虽然有些精神病患者无法改造，但大多数囚犯并非如此。许多人是因为愚蠢的朋友而卷入犯罪，一旦入狱，他们反而会被训练成更顽固的罪犯。改革监狱系统将为国家节省大量成本，对社会和被捕者都有益。然而，这与执法是两个独立的问题。不能通过不执法来解决监狱问题，那样只会惩罚受害者，鼓励犯罪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

It's also you you mentioned you know uh 98% is against poor people. It's also done by a very small percentage of people who commit all the crimes right. Yep. And so what do we do with that percentage of people? Maybe you know people talk about criminal justice reform. Sometimes they talk about basically not putting you know criminals in prison um and and letting them free. Um I guess what is the steelman of like how do we solve for this? What do we do to address this? Well, look, I I think that one, if you're getting the So, there's a the separate conversation of prison reform and look, the way the prison system works and the incentives in it in the United States has a lot of issues. Uh, you know, principally um that it's not we've gone completely away from rehabilitation and this some of this comes from timebased sentencing and other things. And so our recidivism rate is over 70% in the United States and countries that do like a better job it can be, you know, much below 40%. So we are throwing away like look there's certain people who are psychopaths and we're never going to reform them. Um but there's a big most people in prison I had this conversation with my friend Shaka Sangor. I was in prison for 20 years. Most people in prison are actually bettas. So there are people whose idiot friend had the idea to go rob the local drug dealer or whatever and you know and then they get caught up and then they're in prison. Now the problem is those people who could be productive citizens once they get to prison become trained to be much harder criminals. And so you know that's something that we definitely uh we we one it would be a huge cost savings for the country. too. It would be, you know, much better for society and much better for people who get arrested. But like that I I would just say that's an independent problem of law enforcement. And I think the problem with uh mixing those two is you know, I guess the prison system needs reform and needs to be improved. And you know, but we still have to keep people safe. And so I think you have to address those a bit in independently. You can't you're not going to solve the cris the prison problem by not enforcing the law. Like that just you just make the the you punish the victims on behalf of the criminals at that point which is like I think that's a very dangerous thing for a society to do. You basically then create an incentive for nobody to be productive for, you know, your incentive for murder, incentive for robbery, incentive for rape, all that kind of thing.

### 政策改革：非暴力犯罪的替代方案

世界上存在邪恶，**Flock**和我们都无法解决，因此总需要一个地方来处理他们。但对于99%的非邪恶、更具资本主义或机会主义的罪犯，特别是涉及非暴力青少年或年轻成年人的案件，将他们送进监狱是最糟糕的选择。他们会在几个月内从非暴力转变为暴力，并可能终身陷入其中。越来越多的城市意识到有更好的方法：让他们去工作、上学或回家，这比坐牢更好，对城市来说也更便宜，还能让他们成为社会生产性成员。我们正在看到政策上的重要转变，即减少“把人扔进监狱”的心态。此外，还需要技术来加速司法系统。例如，在田纳西州的**谢尔比县**（Shelby County），有数千人等待审判，这让他们变成了罪犯。因此，需要加快司法系统，而增加人力并非答案，技术才是关键。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Yeah. G, why don't you say more on the on the policy side in terms of are are there certain cities where certain policies are are much more effective that others should learn from or Yeah. Well, I mean, I think on the to to Ben's point, just to close that out, too. I mean, there's evil in the world. Yeah. And Flock nor any of us are going to fix that. And so we will always need some place to deal with them. Um then the question is to the 99% of criminals today who are not evil and they're more capitalistic or opportunistic criminals. So I think to your point like there are some interesting activities particularly around nonviolent either juvenile or young adults where putting them in prison is the worst thing to do. They will go from nonviolent to violent in months. They will get stuck in it for their entire life. And so we're seeing more and more cities say there's a better way to do this. You know, you can go to two places, three places, right? You can go to work, you can go to school, you can go home. It's way better than jail. It's cheaper for the city. It's actually now teaching them to become a productive member of society. And so I think for us, like that's probably the most important kind of policy change we're starting to see is less of a mindset that oh, we should throw people in jail. I think the other thing we're looking at at and we actually we had a great conversation with the DA here in San Francisco at Jenkins of just like there also needs to be some technology and either flocks in a builder or someone should to make that part of the process go faster. Um so I was in Shelby County in Tennessee Memphis and there's you know thousands of people waiting for their trial. What do you think's happening in that place? I mean it's they're becoming criminals and so there's also an an effort of like we actually need to speed up the judicial system and I don't think more humans is the answer. So also seeing more and more cities adopt technology to speed that up.

### 拉斯维加斯的“囚犯希望”项目

拉斯维加斯有一个名为“**囚犯希望**”（Hope for Prisoners: 一个帮助刑满释放人员重新融入社会的非营利项目）的**反累犯项目**（Anti-Recidivism Program: 旨在减少刑满释放人员再次犯罪的计划）。如果一个18岁的孩子犯了第一次非暴力罪行，拉斯维加斯的检察官不会起诉他，而是将他送往“**囚犯希望**”项目进行改造。该项目的累犯率接近零。很多时候，人们之所以成为罪犯，是因为犯罪是一条职业道路。如果能创造替代的职业道路，没有人愿意坐牢，除非他们精神失常。因此，创造其他途径非常重要，但同时也要**抑制犯罪职业路径**。这两者是相辅相成的。

Yeah. Yeah. Actually, so in Vegas they have ju just to show you how like fixable this problem is. They have this. So there's an anti-rescetivism program called Hope for Prisoners, which basically, you know, teaches prisoners coming out of jail how to get back into society and then it helps them get jobs. The Vegas prosecutor will, if you're like an 18-year-old kid and you commit a first time offense and it's not violent, they'll send you they they won't prosecute you. They'll send you to Hope for Prisoners and you go through the rehab. they are close to zero percent recidivism on that program. Um just because you know a lot of the times it's like well how do I get people become criminals sometimes because that's that is a career path. Yeah. Um and so if you create an alternative career path, nobody wants to go to jail. Nobody, you know, like unless you're insane or like a a real psycho, that's not the path people want to be on. It's just a path they end up on. And so, you know, creating other avenues um is really good, but like you have to also disincentivize the criminal career path. Yeah. Like those go together.

### 社区餐厅与刑满释放人员的尊严

**德兰西街餐厅**（Delancey Street Restaurant: 旧金山一家由刑满释放人员运营的著名餐厅）是另一个成功的例子，它雇佣曾入狱的人，给他们提供工作机会。企业雇佣刑满释放人员，特别是青少年犯，是非常有成效的。尽早将孩子从犯罪系统中解救出来至关重要，因为一旦入狱十年或二十年，他们很难再适应社会。这种模式也赋予了他们尊严，他们可以向人们讲述自己的故事，这是一个非常感人的地方。

I um Delansancy Street restaurant also another examp is that is that a successful example? Yeah, of course. Yeah, definitely. Definitely. Where Yeah, it's restaurant and they take people who previously been in prison and give them sort of you know Yeah. No, look, I think that businesses, you know, hiring people particularly out of uh and I think the Lansancy Street hires a lot of people out of juvenile juvenile hall. Um, you know, taking kids Yeah. out of the system early is very very productive. It's look, once you've been in prison 10 years or 20 years, it's really hard to adapt back into society. It's a very it's you're going into a whole different world and it gives them a lot of dignity. You know, they they tell the story to people. It's it's very moving moving place.

### 犯罪数据与安全感：政治家的双重标准

有时人们会“**煤气灯效应**”（Gaslighting: 一种心理操控形式，通过否认事实、混淆视听等方式，让受害者怀疑自己的记忆、感知或理智）般地质疑：“你们在抱怨什么？犯罪率下降了啊。为什么你们感到不安全？那只是你在Twitter上看到的右翼言论。”然而，一位曾强烈反对**Flock**的州议员，在自己的房子遭到袭击后，因为**Flock**摄像头在几分钟内帮助逮捕了嫌疑人，现在成了**Flock**的忠实支持者。这反映出一种双重标准：人们希望“削减警察经费”，但不是在自己的城市。许多主张削减警察经费的政治家自己却拥有大量私人安保。我们对安全的期望应该不断提高，就像我们期望信息触手可及一样，我们也应该在任何地方都感到安全。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Um what's interesting because there's there's sometimes I'd call it a form of gaslighting where they say what are you complaining about? Crime is down. Like look at all all the numbers. Why do you feel unsafe? That's just uh you know a clip you saw on Twitter by some right-wing person. You know why are you feeling unsafe walking the streets of San Francisco? Um what what do you say to what's the right way of thinking about that? It's it's funny you mentioned that there's a um an elected official um a state representative of a certain state and I won't disclose her information and they were a very loud antagonist to flock and sadly she was like a lot of political figures are she was the victim of a targeted attack her house was shot at she's a massive fan of flock now because that person was arrested within minutes because there's a flock on her street called number one they're like yeah we got the guy he's in and he had been posting online about, you know, she's this, she's that. And so there is a bit of like, oh, we want to defund the police, just not in our city. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And that's the main monster. Well, and then a lot of the politicians who want to defund the police have massive private security. Yeah. It's a Yeah. If you've got three guys walking around with you all the time, you feel fine. But I also think like for me at least, our expectations of safety should only go up. Yeah. Like just like we expect information at our fingertips, why shouldn't we feel safe everywhere we go? They say like, "Hey, living in a city is dangerous." You know, that's what you signed up for. I mean, that's that's the only I've only gotten into one argument with an an antagonist who I said, you know, I just don't think crime should exist. And he and he was like, I think it's just a part of living in a big city. And I was like, that seems horrible. Like it's like trash, too. Like I like clean streets. Like these are not unreasonable things to ask for.

### 犯罪统计的虚假性与社会责任

有人认为犯罪是大城市生活的一部分，但这似乎是可怕的观点。谁来决定多少凶杀案是可以接受的？如果发生在你的家人或朋友身上，你还会觉得可以接受吗？大多数人会说不。许多辩论中，特权阶层的人主张减少警力，而真正需要警力的人却说：“等等，我想要更多。”这种现象在所有科技城镇的市政厅会议上都很常见。此外，许多犯罪统计数据被伪造、低报。如果犯罪不被起诉，人们就会停止报警。旧金山曾出现过这种情况，汽车被盗后报警，警察会说“我们能做什么？”于是人们就不再报警了。真正的衡量标准是民意调查，许多城市的调查显示，受害人数与官方犯罪统计数据走向相反。自2020年以来，犯罪记录和起诉方式都发生了变化，因此趋势线并不正确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Yeah. That seems like a very odd uh perspective, but I you know I I under like particularly if you're a young person I could see uh well they worry about overly uh you know and uh you know putting people too too many people in prison for the wrong crimes or they worry about uh militarized police. All those seem like reasonable concerns. Yeah, I guess I guess the the thing for me is you know who's going to decide how many homicides is okay, right? Yeah. And is it okay to say like you or your family or your friends, you know, is that okay with you? And then most people would say no to that. It's just like fine. It's it's like a fine thing for the other guy. Yeah. And what I think to to bend to your point too, the number of times we've been in debates where you've got a privileged person in a community articulating a desire for less policing, yet the person who actually need it needs it is sitting there saying, "Wait, wait, wait. Time out. I actually want more all the all the tech town halls look like that and that's what every town hall looks like and thinking like you shouldn't be making decisions for other people. Yeah, I'm so empathetic. I want you murdered, right? That's the uh it's the safest thing for you. Yeah, it's so crazy. Well, the other thing on crime statistics is u you know like I think it's pretty widely known that like a lot of crime stats have been faked, under reportported, etc. And then if you're not prosecuting crimes, particularly in San Francisco, we had this where they don't get called in. Like if your car got broken into in San Francisco and you called the police, they would be like, "What do you want us to do?" Like we're not going to prosecute it. So people just stop calling. And the real measure of this is the surveys that they've done in almost every city on um have you been a victim of a crime and versus the actual official crime statistics go in the opposite direction. Yeah. And so, you know, over, you know, longitudinal uh data. So, I just think like it's it's a narrative that's supported by like fake numbers, right? And it's also the stuff that's also unreported is just do you feel safe walking, you know, in in your city? Do you feel safe with your kids, you know, walking at night? And um anyways, and and by the way, the reporting on that did change after 2020. So like literally the practices of how crimes are recorded, the how crimes are prosecuted changed and so people go well like the trend line is correct even if the numbers No, it's not. It's not correct.

### Flock Safety 的数据策略与跨州合作

**Flock Safety**让城市和州能够选择自己的警务模式。城市可以控制两个主要杠杆：**数据保留期限**（Data Retention Period: 数据被存储和保留的时间长度）和**数据共享**（Data Sharing: 在不同实体之间交换或访问数据的行为）。在**Flock**成立之前，其他公司会永久存储位置数据，但这带来了风险。**Flock**默认存储30天，但可根据州法律调整，例如新泽西州是五年，加利福尼亚州最长90天，有些机构甚至只存储七天。数据保留期限与效率呈线性相关，因为犯罪并非总是在同一天被报告。第二个杠杆是数据共享，即选择与其他警察部门合作。犯罪分子不会在意城市边界，但城市会。因此，可以控制数据共享范围。例如，在加利福尼亚州，数据不能离开本州。但**Garrett**担心，犯罪分子是否会从加利福尼亚州逃到内华达州？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Yeah. And what I love about what you guys are doing at Flock is that you're giving the technology so that you know cities and states can choose where they want to be on the spectrum basically. Talk more a little bit about that because different different places have different values. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so, so there's probably two, there's two big levers that a city can pull. So, one is retention. So, we were before Flock was started, there was other companies in this space and they would historically store location data in perpetuity. And my philosophy starting the company was like that seems more of a risk than an asset because it's just just a lot of data. Um, and so we store for 30 days, but you can flex that up and down. So, in New Jersey, they store it for five years. That's the state law. That's not our choice. That's just the law. California, there's a max of 90 days. We have some agencies in California that store for seven days. Yeah. I mean, you could store for a day. Now, the efficacy is probably linearly correlated by the retention period because like how often do you call a crime the same day it happens? Actually, not every time. You're away, your car's stolen, whatever it could be. So, one is data retention and the second is data sharing. Like, what other police departments do you want to work with? Criminals don't really care where cities start and stop, but cities do by design. And so, you can control where you share. So in some states like California, the data can never leave the state. In Virginia recently adopted a similar bill, uh Illinois, Colorado, more states are saying, "Hey, you know, we we trust our state." I think that's an okay approach. I worry about, you know, Ben, maybe, you know, do criminals ever leave California to Nevada? Like I think they do. So, like it's

### 信息不共享的后果：图帕克谋杀案

**Ben**提到，**图帕克·沙库尔**（Tupac Shakur: 著名说唱歌手，1996年在拉斯维加斯被枪杀）的谋杀案之所以近30年未破，部分原因在于**洛杉矶警察局**在拉斯维加斯对案件的干预。当时**洛杉矶警察局**腐败，甚至有警员保护杀害**图帕克**的罪犯。信息不共享导致了案件长期未决，使得一位半个世纪以来最伟大的艺术家之一被描绘成一个奇怪的罪犯受害者。**Flock**支持地方、州和联邦层面的警务，但不会替他们制定法律或决定执法范围。例如，加利福尼亚州不执行移民法，而佐治亚州有不同的犯罪定义。**Flock**只是提供技术支持，让各地根据自己的价值观做出选择。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

by the way, so this is this is one of the things we ran into on the Tupac case, by the way, uh was the LAPD did so much stuff to foul that case in Vegas. Um which is why that murder went unsolved for whatever it was like uh almost 30 years. Um and why they do that? Well, in in that case, the LAPD was corrupt and the well, there were literally criminals in the police force protecting the criminals who uh killed Tupac. And, you know, thankfully we kind of uh reopened the cold case and we caught the guy. But it's, you know, like when you think about it in terms of the actual victim Yeah. and how bad it was that like one of the great artists in the half century ended up being portrayed as like this weird criminal victim of a crime because we never solved it. Uh like that's what happens when you don't share information. Like that's the that's a real issue. Yeah. But yeah, so I mean for us, you know, we've got some agencies, you know, some of the most liberal cities in the country, huge fans of Flock. They tweak it to their likings. And I think we just get back to it's not our job as a company to write the law, decide what laws are enforced. Immigration is not enforced in California. I don't care. That's up to Californians. I live in Georgia and we have different expectations of what's criminal, what's not criminal. And you know, there is a difference between local, state, and federal. And we just try to stay out of it and say good luck everyone. We're here to support.

### 复杂问题与强硬领导

犯罪与惩罚是一个复杂的系统性问题，民主制度面临的挑战之一就是如何处理这些复杂性。当问题被抛入政治领域时，就会变得混乱。然而，当犯罪发生时，这种复杂性会变得非常简单，尤其是在有强大领导力的市长、检察官、市议会和警长明确表示“如果你在我的城市犯罪，我就会逮捕你”时。目前，美国存在一股强大的力量，试图将犯罪“非刑事化”，许多检察官和法官的资金来源就是为了不判罪犯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Yeah. Like I mean, I think you have bigger fish to fry, you know, if you're certainly Garrett. Um and it I think sometimes as a society it's really hard like this is one of the challenges with democracy is some of these problems are very complex and um you know like crime and punishment is a systemic like complicated issue and it's hard for people who are really digging into the problem to design the right system and then once you throw it into polic politics, you know, anybody says anything and it gets all convoluted and this and that and the other. So, it is like really tough to deal with that. And I think that's why we, you know, that's why we don't have a much better system than we have. Yeah. But I think the other thing too, Ben, to your point is when it happens though, that complication becomes very simple when you have strong leadership with a backbone normally in a mayor and a DA, city council and a sheriff where they're like, I'm going to arrest you if you commit a crime in my city. Yep. You have to say that out loud. You have to say it and do it. Well, but then the problem is you're going to get arrested and the prosecutor is going to prosecute you and the judge is going to be like enforce the law. Yeah. which is it's a much harder combination than you might think, you know, and there have been look there's a huge push to not crim to decriminalize crime essentially in this country and look it's still going on and it's you know there are still these you know prosecutors and judges that are funded basically for the purposes of not wow convicting people. Yep.

### 有组织犯罪的复杂性与后果

美国存在严重的**有组织犯罪**（Organized Crime: 结构化的犯罪集团，从事非法活动以获取利润）问题。一些犯罪集团的复杂程度令人震惊，例如东欧和南美帮派经营着大规模的“商业”活动。他们会购买合法的货运公司，接收满载商品的半挂车，然后让货物凭空消失，一个月后关闭公司并消失，从而窃取数千万美元的商品，并通过Facebook Marketplace等渠道洗白。这种犯罪没有枪击，一切在纸面上看起来都很干净，但规模巨大且运作良好。在旧金山，当政治运动主张“人们饥饿，不能因入店行窃而逮捕他们”时，大规模帮派趁机将商店洗劫一空，导致大型商场关闭，市民受到惩罚。这并非饥饿的人所为，而是有组织犯罪系统性地销售赃物，将低级罪犯（通常是来自南美的帮派成员）作为棋子。这些未经深思熟虑的疯狂想法带来了严重的后果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Yeah. And is that for ideological um reasons or do we have a big organized crime problem in in this country or was you you mentioned earlier a big disorganized crime problem? Well, I will I will say though that the the se sheer sophistication of of some criminal groups is actually astonishing. There is definitely low-level crime, but you've got there's it's become somewhat politicized, but there are truly a large number of Eastern European and South American gangs operating largecale businesses. And I call them businesses because while they commit crime, they don't run sloppy. And so I'll give you an example like in logistics space. So Ben and I are two buddies from Eastern Europe. We go and buy a freight forerter, a legitimate company. We start receiving semis full of product. And guess what? They just disappear. And then after about a month, we shut the company down and disappear. And we've taken tens of millions of dollars of goods and then we flip it on Facebook Marketplace and all secondary places and it's clean. No one gets shot and everything looks clean on paper. And like this is obviously not easy to like you have to be sophisticated, but like this is large large scale and it works. And by the way, this so this is what happened. You know, I I had uh when the crime went really crazy in San Francisco, I had a long conversation with Mayor Breed about it. And uh one of the things that so in San Francisco, right, like the whole political movement was people are hungry. You can't arrest them for shoplifting and so forth. So as soon as we did that, what happened was massive gangs took everything out of the stores. They ended up right shutting down the big mall. like there's no shopping in San Francisco whatsoever anymore. Um, and so all the citizens got punished. But like it wasn't hungry people. It was like organized crime systematically selling the goods. Um, second, it was that kind of thing. And so you get now the people that they deployed were low-level criminals, right? Like you can just pick have a kid go rob the thing for you and you pay them, right? Um, but that's that's not what's going on. It's not that the kid is hungry, it's that the kid is now a career criminal um working for an or an organized gang um probably from South America. So, you know, like the side effects of these off-the cuff, nobody thought it through crazy ideas um are like highly consequential.

### 智能精准警务的未来愿景

**Garrett**描绘了**Flock**实现目标后的世界：一个充满**智能**和**精准**警务的未来。他分享了一个成功的案例：一名精神失常的男子从医院离开后驾车随意开枪。由于城市及周边警局合作，发布了“寻找武装危险精神失常车辆”的通缉令。当该车辆驶入一个大型商业中心（也是**Flock**的客户）时，警方立即收到警报。传统的做法是部署**特警队**（SWAT: Special Weapons And Tactics: 特警队），这将耗时15分钟，并可能导致伤亡。然而，在这个案例中，实时犯罪中心的操作员点击一个按钮，**无人机**（Drone: 无人驾驶飞行器）在40秒内抵达商场。通过无人机，警方可以放大画面，发现嫌疑人有纹身（通过**Flock**的**Nova**产品，该产品在车牌识别命中时能提供嫌疑人的逮捕记录和可识别特征）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Yeah. Garrett, talk about what the world looks like in a world where flock achieves its goal. Like what's the future of policing? You know, flock camera on every block. Like talk talk about Yeah, I think the word Ben used was intelligence. Yeah. And so much of that shift is starting to happen. I would add to the intelligence precision. And like I'll paint for you a picture of a recent success story that to me is the future and it just hasn't happened in every city yet. Yeah. So there's a individual um who leaves a hospital mentally unwell um and shoots someone in a drive by just driving by and start shooting people. This is a real story. Um because all the police departments in the city worked like in the neighboring cities worked together. They put out a hot list entry for, hey, we're looking for this vehicle, armed, dangerous, mentally unwell. That vehicle pulls into the largest commercial center for one of the cities. It's a big mall. The mall is also a flock customer. So, the police department gets a ding on that camera and says, "Hey, we found this guy. Now, let's pause." Traditional response is you deploy SWAT and it's going to take about 15 minutes to get everyone ready. They're going to come in hot and someone's going to die. It's not clear who, either a citizen, an officer, or the suspect's going to die, but let's assume someone's going to die. And then just as not as important, but just as a matter of fact, that mall is also going to see a dramatic decline in attendance and it could lead to probably the end of the mall, which is not good too for that city.

### 无人机与AI：更安全的逮捕方式

通过**Nova**产品，警方发现该嫌疑人曾被捕六次，并有一个非常独特的纹身。无人机在半英里外追踪嫌疑人，嫌疑人毫不知情。警方确认没有看到枪支后，两名便衣警员在空中保护下上前逮捕了嫌疑人。整个过程无人知晓，安全完成。市议会看到这一演示后，一致认为“我们需要到处部署无人机，它们更安全、更精准、更智能。”当警察部门整合所有数据和传感器时，这种智能精准警务就会成为现实。未来，**人工智能**的**代理层**（Agentic Layer: 能够自主执行任务、决策和交互的智能系统层）可以帮助解决警力问题，尤其是在夜班或枯燥的工作中，软件可以替代部分人力。这种警务模式的最终效果是警员能花更多时间与社区互动，减少文书工作和报告，从而更有效地参与社区事务。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

Okay, let's unpause. What happened? Sitting at a comfortable desk like we are here, a real-time crime center operator clicks a button that says launch drone. The drone is at the mall in about 40 seconds. From about a half mile away, we can zoom in, find that the individual has a tattoo. Um, we pulled that because we have a product called Nova that when an LPR hit comes through, we can say, "Oh, wow. This person's been arrested six times. Is there any Oh, there is interesting information. This person has a very distinguishable forearm tattoo." So, we spot the tattoo halfway. This guy has no idea we're following him. We don't see a gun. Two plane close officers walk up. The whole time they know they've got overhead protection. They're being helped just like you would in the army. They take them down. No one has any idea. And they then present this to city council and city council was like, "We need drones everywhere. Yeah, we need drones everywhere. It's safer. It's more precise. There's a level intelligence." And so when I look at this police department, they've got all their data integrated. They have all their sensors integrated, it's just happening. And I think for us, when we think about a kind of agentic layer on top of that where now you can start to reduce some of your staffing problems, but some of these jobs, yeah, no one wants to work the night shift. wants to like some jobs are just like not fun. There's a way to do it with software. So I think that kind of intelligent precise policing is where we want. I think the net effect of that to Ben's earlier point is officers spend more time with their community. Yeah. Less time filling out paperwork, less time writing reports, more time engaged.

### Flock Safety：拯救生命与儿童

**Flock Safety**在拯救生命方面发挥了关键作用。今年，他们帮助找回了超过450名失踪儿童。当人们说要“禁止**Flock**”时，**Garrett**反驳道：“直到你的孩子被偷走。”他有三个孩子，他希望知道如果他们出了任何问题，**Flock**会在那里。例如，圣地亚哥曾发生一起劫车事件，婴儿被留在后座。由于圣地亚哥部署了大量**Flock**摄像头，警方成功找回了婴儿并逮捕了嫌疑人。虽然这种事件在某个城市可能不常发生，但在全国范围内每天都在发生。**Garrett**的工作是英雄般的，也是最鼓舞人心的。

Just quick last one story. Don't you have a couple stories of of of you actually saving like a baby? Oh, I mean we we helped return over 450 missing children this year. Oh my god.

I've got three kids and I want to know that if anything goes happens wrong with them. Flock is there. Yeah. And this like you get carjacked and your baby's in the back seat and they take the baby and like that kind of thing. I know it happened.

Yeah. hops in kid in the back like obviously wasn't none that wasn't a part of the plan but became a part of the plan and like thankfully you know they've got a lot of flock cameras in San Diego and and we were able to get the individual but that happens doesn't happen every day in your city but it happens every day in the country.
