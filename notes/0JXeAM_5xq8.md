### 明确核心：明智消费的心理基石与优先级排序

我们每个人一生中都曾花费巨额财富，但有多少人能肯定自己是明智的消费者？当被问及一生总共花费了多少钱，以及是否明智地花了钱时，大多数人会犹豫不决。这种不确定性，恰恰暴露了我们可能并未为自己清晰定义“明智消费”的标准，尽管我们几乎每天都在购物。然而，**明智消费**（good buying）能够对我们的人生产生极其深远的影响。考虑到我们一生中将花费巨额财富，甚至可能不止一次，将其用得更明智，意味着我们可以减少不必要的开支，或者在相同预算下，让生活变得更加**奢华**（luxurious）、**舒适**（comfortable）、**可持续**（sustainable）或**有趣**（fun）。

令人欣慰的是，我们并非孤军奋战。有专业人士的经验可供学习。作为 **BCG** 的采购领域领导者，我与全球各地的客户合作，他们涵盖了高科技公司、汽车制造商、美国大型制药企业、中东石油公司，乃至瑞士钟表制造商和中东的大规模生产商。这些企业都需要采购大量物品——从钢铁、备件到知识产权，甚至是新鲜水果。就在上周，我还为一家挪威的鲑鱼养殖场进行了一场活鱼拍卖。我的承诺是，通过学习这些专业采购团队的集体智慧，你将终身成为一位**明智的消费者**。而且，这并不复杂，它仅仅归结为这些公司做得对的三条基本法则。

第一条法则：**优先考虑真正重要的事物**（Prioritize on what really matters）。这听起来很简单，不是吗？但事实并非如此，因为这里缺少了几个关键的限定词：为**一个群体，共同**地优先考虑真正重要的事物。在任何公司，几乎每个家庭，都存在几个关键的决策者或影响者。即使对你自己而言，你也常常不确定如何平衡健康食品与更低的价格，或是更舒适的购物体验与可持续的产品。我们是否会为了让邻居嫉妒而支付额外费用？你可能会笑，但我来自德国，有人或许会说，我们整个汽车工业的建立都离不开这种心态。

专业的采购人员会仔细研读**公司战略**（corporate strategy），并与**业务伙伴**（business partners）沟通，以明确什么才是真正能让公司变得更好的因素。而那些顶尖的采购者（superstar buyers）会做得更进一步，他们会**图形化地明确**（graphically pin down）各项优先级，并与所有人分享。

在个人生活中，优先级排序可能呈现出不同的图景。也许在人生的早期，比如求学阶段或职业生涯初期，你资金有限，因此更看重**乐趣**（fun），但同时也会注意**成本意识**（cost consciousness）。稍晚一些，你可能组建了家庭，有了孩子，这时你就会非常关注食物、玩具、家具的**品质**（quality），只为给他们提供最好的。再往后，你可能更看重**舒适度**（comfort），渴望一种轻松自在的生活方式。我甚至见过许多家庭，他们的优先级组合是截然不同的。

核心在于，要成为一个好的消费者，你不必遵循一套预设的规则。仅仅是为你自己和你的亲人，你需要非常清晰地明确这些优先级。

I've got two questions
for each one of you.
Question number one.
How much money did you spend
in your entire life so far?
That already takes a bit
to estimate, right?
And question number two,
did you spend your money wisely?
If you hesitate now and are not so sure,
it likely means you're not
a good buyer, frankly,
because you have not even defined
for yourself what good buying truly is.
And that -- sorry for the bitter truth --
despite your buying things
pretty much every day.
good buying can have such a massive
effect on your entire life.
And through your lifetime, you will spend
a fortune, if not several fortunes,
considering we're in Dubai.
Spending it more wisely
will either make you have to spend less
or, for the same amount, make
your life more luxurious, comfortable,
sustainable, fun or whatever else
you want it to be.
And the good news is there are people
you can learn it from.
As a procurement leader in BCG,
I work with them throughout the world.
High tech companies,
auto manufacturers, American Big Pharma,
Middle Eastern oil companies,
from Swiss clock manufacturers
to Middle Eastern mass producers.
They all have to buy a lot of things --
steel, spare parts,
intellectual property rights, fruit.
Just last week, I did a live auction
for a Norwegian salmon farm for fish.
My promise to you is if you learn
from the combined knowledge
of these professional procurement teams,
you will be a good buyer
for the rest of your life.
And on top, it's easy.
It only boils down to three rules
these companies do right.
Number one, prioritize
on what really matters.
Now that sounds simple, doesn’t it?
The truth is, it's not,
because there's a few words missing.
Prioritize on what really matters
for a group, together.
In every company, in almost
every household, there's a few players.
And even for yourself,
you're oftentimes not so sure
how to prioritize healthy food
versus cheaper prices.
How about a more comfortable buying
experience versus sustainable products?
Do we pay extra just to make
our neighbor jealous?
You might laugh, but I'm from Germany,
and you might argue we built an entire
auto industry purely on that feeling.
(Laughter)
Now professional buyers,
they actually read the corporate strategy,
they align with business partners
to find out what’s it really
that makes our company better.
The superstar buyers go even further.
They graphically pin down
what are the priorities
and then share with everybody.
For your life, it might look like this.
Maybe, at the start, during education,
start of your career,
you don't have so much money
and therefore you want to have fun,
but you have some cost consciousness.
A bit later, you might
form a family, [have] children,
and you care a lot about quality
of the food, of the toys,
of the furniture,
just to have it all right for them.
Maybe, a bit later,
you care a lot about comfort.
You just want to have
an easygoing lifestyle.
I've even seen
a lot of families like this,
who have slightly different priorities.
(Laughter)
Now the core thing is to be a good buyer,
you don't have to follow
a predefined set of rules.
It's just for yourself
and your loved ones,
you need to have
these priorities very clear.

### 策略博弈：影响盟友与构建谈判优势

现在，我们进入第二条法则：**影响你的盟友**（Influence your allies）。想象这样一个场景：你正准备购买一辆新车。你来到经销商那里，首先映入眼帘的是你的孩子们爬进车里，他们穿着脏兮兮的靴子，大声喊着他们有多喜欢这辆车——颜色、设计，一切都让他们着迷。这时，你已经处于谈判的劣势，而汽车销售员却告诉你，现在带有脏污座椅的车非常少见，价格方面他无能为力。就在那一刻，你的妻子给了你一个眼神，仿佛在说：“拜托，别搞砸了。我也非常想要这辆车。” 在这种情况下，你很可能不仅会买下这辆车，而且绝不可能以一个好价格成交。

在商业领域，**好的采购者**（good buyers）深知他们必须**提前与盟友达成一致**（align with their allies up front）。他们会明确谁将在谈判前、谈判中、谈判后说什么。只有当这些事项明确后，他们才能确保真正达成最有利的交易。而顶尖的采购者（superstar buyers）则更进一步，他们拥有影响**利益相关者**（stakeholders）真正想要的东西的能力。

让我来介绍一种名为“**逆向思考法**”（inverting method）的技巧。我曾与一家大型铁路公司进行过一次工作坊，目的是降低大尺寸钢轨的成本。当时，我们面对的是一群经验丰富但似乎固步自封的采购人员，他们坚持认为一切都已优化。60分钟后，我看着一张空白的翻页纸，感到一丝恐慌。然而，我的同事却非常冷静。他转向大家说：“我们暂时忘掉这个练习。假设你刚换了一个新老板，他比你年轻，而且要解雇你。这很不公平，而你唯一能做的反击方式是，在接下来的三个月里，尽可能地增加成本。你有什么创造性的想法，能在不直接涨价的情况下增加成本吗？”

瞬间，想法如潮水般涌现：“我们可以买过长的钢轨，然后不得不切割它们。”“我们可以买过短的钢轨，然后需要焊接起来。”“我们可以买太多，然后不得不入库储存。”“我们可以太晚下单，所以需要支付罚款。”“我们可以太早付款，损失利息。”“我们可以太晚付款，然后支付滞纳金。”刹那间，翻页纸被填满了。这时，我的同事再次转向大家：“我们能确定在这些每一个维度上，我们都真的达到了最优吗？”

同样的方法，在购买汽车时，你也可以与家人一起运用。我们应该怎么做才能**增加价格**？我们可以选择在春季，在一个消费水平较高的城市购车。只去一个位于高档区域的经销商那里。我们可以直接表明，我们只考虑你这一家经销商。我们可以告诉他们我们多么喜欢这辆车。我们可以不要求任何折扣。当你列出所有这些可能推高价格的因素后，再反过来思考，你就能非常接近真正的“最优解”了。对我而言，“逆向思考法”也是一个绝佳的提醒：**明智的消费**（good buying）可以是有趣的，也可以是富有创造性的。

现在，我们来到了第三条法则——**从强势的起点进行谈判**（negotiate from strong starting positions）。人们可能会认为，强势谈判意味着**强硬施压**（strong-arming）、**刻薄**（being mean）、**咄咄逼人**（being aggressive），甚至对人大喊大叫。事实恰恰相反。它始于更早的阶段，并且与你**构建的替代方案**（alternatives）息息相关。你需要明确有哪些**替代供应商**（alternative suppliers），有哪些**替代产品**（alternative products）。好的采购者甚至会**延长现有解决方案的使用寿命**（extend the usage of the existing solution），以确保自己不处于时间压力之下。

顶尖的采购者（superstar buyers）会做得更进一步，有时他们甚至会**摧毁替代方案**（destroy alternatives）来制造一种“非此即彼”的局面。这听起来有点奇怪，不是吗？但在现实世界中，我们往往从极端案例中学习得最好。让我给你讲一个极端的历史例子：1519年，**埃尔南·科尔特斯**（Hernando Cortés）抵达墨西哥的韦拉克鲁斯。他只有500名士兵，而面前是庞大的阿兹特克帝国。他所做的，是将他的士兵聚集在海滩上，确保阿兹特克人看到他，然后**拆毁并部分凿沉了他的船只**，仅仅是为了表明一个决心：“我们绝不后退。”

这一切对明智消费意味着什么？对我的生活又意味着什么？我认识一对夫妇，他们本应购买一处房产，有两个选择。选择一，他们非常喜欢，但价格略高。选择二——我们称之为B号房——他们不太喜欢，但能够负担得起。这时，A号房（他们真正喜欢的）的业主正在玩弄他们，让他们长时间等待，寄希望于能收到来自其他人或他们自己更好的报价。终于有一天，妻子为B号房预约了**公证**（notary appointment），然后回到A号房的业主面前，明确表示：“这是我们的告别会。很遗憾，我们不会回来了。这是我们为B号房预约公证的证明。感谢您所有的讨论。”

只有当事情变得严肃时，A号房的业主才让步。只有那时，他们才得以达成交易。这其中不需要大喊大叫，也不需要虚张声势，仅仅是从一个**强势的立场**（position of strength）出发，**玩转了替代方案**（playing of the alternatives）。

无论你过去花了多少钱，都已经过去了。对于你未来将要花费的每一笔钱，请记住这三条法则，你就能成为一个明智的消费者。谢谢大家。

Now the core thing is to be a good buyer,
you don't have to follow
a predefined set of rules.
It's just for yourself
and your loved ones,
you need to have
these priorities very clear.
And now, we are already
at rule number two.
Influence your allies.
Imagine the following situation.
You're off to buy a new car.
You arrive at the dealership,
and the first thing that happens
is your kids climb into the car.
They have dirty boots on and they yell
and tell you how much they love it.
The colors, the design, everything.
You're already a bit on your back foot,
starting to negotiate,
and the car dealer
basically tells you that right now,
cars with dirty seats are a bit rare.
He can't do anything on the price.
In that moment,
your wife gives you a look, like,
"Please don't mess it up.
I also want this car so much."
You will very likely not not buy the car.
You will for sure not buy it
at a good price.
In business, the good buyers,
they know they have to align
with their allies up front.
Who's going to say what in a negotiation,
after negotiation, before negotiation.
Only if these things are clear,
they can ensure they really
strike the best deals.
The superstar buyers go even further.
They have the ability to influence
the stakeholders on what they really want.
Let me tell you
about the inverting method.
I once had a workshop
with a big railway company.
We were supposed to reduce the cost
of big steel tracks,
and we had a group sitting there
of rather old buyers basically
telling us everything is optimal.
After 60 minutes, I was sitting
in front of an empty flip chart,
panicking a bit.
My colleague, however, was very cool.
He just turned around
to the crowd and said,
"Let's forget this exercise for a moment.
What would you do
in the following situation?
You just got a new boss.
He's younger than you and he's firing you.
It's unfair, and the only thing
you can do to strike back.
In the next three months,
when you're still in the company,
increase the cost.
Do you have any creative ideas
to increase the cost
without just raising prices?"
And now, the ideas were flying.
"We could buy too long tracks
we have to cut.
We could buy too short tracks
we'd have to weld together.
We could buy too many
we'd have to put in stock.
We could order too late,
so we'd have to pay a fee.
We could pay too early
to not have interest rates.
We could pay too late, to pay a fine."
All of a sudden, the flip chart was full,
and my colleague turned around again.
"Are we sure we are really at the optimum
in each one of these dimensions?"
And when you're buying a car,
you can do the same with your family.
What would we have to do
to increase the price?
We could buy it in the spring
in an expensive city.
Only go to one dealer
in a rather high-class part of the town.
We could state right away
we would only go to you, the dealer.
We could tell them
how much we love the car.
We could not ask for a rebate.
And once you've listed all these things
and then turn it around,
then you really come close
to what's an optimum.
To me, the inverting method
is also a great reminder.
Good buying can be fun,
and good buying can be creative.
And now, we are already
at rule number three --
negotiate from strong starting positions.
People might think strong negotiations
have something to do
with strong-arming somebody,
with being mean, with being aggressive,
almost yelling at people.
The opposite is true.
It starts way before,
and it has a lot to do
with the alternatives you build.
You need to align
what are alternative suppliers,
what are, maybe, alternative products.
Good buyers maybe even extend
the usage of the existing solution
just to ensure they're not
under time pressure.
The superstar buyers go even further.
Sometimes, they destroy
alternatives just to make a point.
Now that sounds a bit odd, doesn’t it?
But in this world,
you learn best from extremes.
And let me tell you
an extreme historical example.
In 1519, Hernando Cortés
arrived in Veracruz, Mexico.
He only had 500 soldiers.
In front of him, the vast Aztec empire.
What he did is he gathered
his people on the beach,
made sure the Aztec saw him,
and then he dismantled
and partly sunk his ships,
just to make a point.
"We will not go back."
Now what does this all mean
for good buying?
What does this mean for my life?
I know a couple who were supposed to buy
a house, and they had two alternatives.
Alternative one, they loved,
but it was slightly too high.
Alternative two --
let's call it house number B --
they didn't like as much,
but they could afford it.
Now the owner of house A,
which they really liked, was playing them,
putting them on the long bench,
basically waiting
for a better offer to come in
from somebody else or from them.
At one point, the wife just made
a notary appointment for House B,
went back to house number one,
to the owner, and basically said,
"This is our goodbye meeting.
We, sadly, will not come back.
Here's our approval of the notary
appointment for House B.
Thank you
for all the discussions."
Only then, when it became serious,
the owner of house number one gave in.
Only then they were able
to strike through.
There was no yelling needed, no bluffing.
It was just a plain
playing of the alternatives
from a position of strength.
Whatever you have spent
in your life is gone.
Whatever you will spend next,
think about these three rules,
and you will spend your money wisely.
Thank you.
(Applause)
