### Uber的奋斗文化

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 来到**Uber**，你就要拼命工作。如果你表现不佳，我们会让你知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: You come to Uber, you're going to work your ass off. And if you're not performing, we're going to let you know.

</details>

**主持人**: 但你担心他们可能无法接受真相吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: But do you ever worry that they might not be able to deal with the truth?

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 那他们就可以离开，因为生活中最重要的技能就是努力工作的技能。当你看到顶级运动员，像**C罗**、**迈克尔·乔丹**，他们当然有天赋。但他们与众不同之处在于他们拼命工作。这是一种后天习得的技能，不是与生俱来的。你可能更聪明、更有天赋等等，但我不会让任何人比我更努力。带着这种心态，当你加入**Uber**时，它每年亏损30亿美元。现在它每年产生85亿美元的自由现金流。但你似乎就是以这种方式被锻造出来的，你注定要永不懈怠。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Then they can leave because the most important skill in life is the skill of working hard. And when you see the top athletes, **Ronaldo**, **Michael Jordan**, of course they're talented. But the thing that's different about them is they work their asses off. And that's a learned skill. That's not something you're born with. You may be smarter, more talented, etc. But I'm not going to let anyone out me. with that mentality. When you joined **Uber**, it was losing 3 billion per year. Now it generates 8.5 billion in free cash flow every year. But it seems that you were forged in such a way that you were going to be relentless.

</details>

### 童年经历与奋斗动力

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 是的。这真的始于1978年伊朗伊斯兰革命时我出生在伊朗。我们在那里不安全。我记得有一次，革命卫队闯进了我们家后院，子弹穿过了我们的客厅。所以我的家人来到美国重建生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Yeah. And it really started with being born in Iran with the Islamic Revolution in 1978. We were not safe there. And I remember at one point we had these revolutionary guards come into the backyard and bullets went through our living room. So my family came to the US to rebuild their lives.

</details>

**主持人**: 你当时八九岁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You were 8 9 years old.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 是的。那真的摧毁了我父亲。抱歉。这对我来说很难谈论。没关系。好吧，让我再试一次。看到那一切让我走上了一条道路，我只想让我的家人感到骄傲。所以我学习了生物电气工程，然后我的第一份工作是投资银行，我得以看到大型公司建立的过程，然后我有机会接管**Expedia**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Yeah. And it really destroyed my dad. Sorry me. It's tough for me to talk about it. It's okay. All right, let me try again. Seeing that has put me on a road where I just wanted to make my family proud. So I studied bioelect electrical engineering and then my first job was investment banking and I got to see the process of big companies being built and then I had the opportunity to take over **Expedia**

</details>

**主持人**: 在你担任**Expedia**首席执行官的12年里，销售额从21亿美元增长到88.8亿美元，你曾是美国科技公司中薪酬最高的首席执行官。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: and in your 12 years as CEO **Expedia** sales increased from 2.1 billion to 8.8 8 billion and you were the highest paid CEO of a US tech company

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 我把这一切都抛在了脑后，去了**Uber**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: and I left it all behind to get over

</details>

**主持人**: 我想深入探讨实际的公司建设，你如何让公司努力工作，并创造持续改进的文化等等。但现在我们中间出现了一个“外星人”，那就是**AI**。现在驾驶，我认为是世界上最庞大的职业之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: and I want to get into practical company building how you would get that company to work hard and create a culture of continuous improvement and all that stuff but there's alien that's arrived amongst us which is **AI** now driving I think is one of the biggest employees in the world like as a profession

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 我的意思是，我们平台上有950万司机和快递员。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: I mean we've got 9 and a half million drivers and couriers on our platform

</details>

**主持人**: 你拥有的那些司机和快递员将失业，坦白地说，面对这种情况，那900万人该怎么办？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: those drivers careers that you have will be out of work being honest about the situation what do the 9 million people

</details>

**主持人**: **Dara**，你领导着我这一代最具影响力、最有趣、最受关注的公司之一。上次我查的时候，它价值数千亿美元，而且我每天都在使用这家公司。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: **Darren**, you lead one of the most consequential, interesting, talked about companies of my generation. It's worth hundreds of billions of dollars last time I checked and it's a it's a company that I use every single day.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 谢谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Thank you.

</details>

**主持人**: 我查阅了你的故事。你曾是**Expedia**的首席执行官。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I've looked through your story. You were the CEO of **Expedia**.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 嗯，一度是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Mhm. at one point.

</details>

**主持人**: 你目前是**Uber**的首席执行官，你把这家公司从一家亏损的公司变成了一家高盈利的公司，并且在如此巨大的转型时期持续取得成功。你的故事以一种非常有趣的方式开始。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You're currently the CEO of **Uber** and you've turned that company from a a lossmaking company to a highly profitable company and one that has continued to be successful through such a great time of transition. I your story starts in a very interesting way

</details>

**主持人**: 当我开始为嘉宾做研究时，我有时会有一种预设，认为你是在加州长大，上了**斯坦福**等等。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: and I was you know when I start doing the research for guests sometimes I I I think I come in with some kind of presumption that I grew up in California, you went to Stanford etc.

</details>

**主持人**: 但事实并非如此。你能带我回到最早的背景，这样我才能理解你为什么是现在的样子吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: But that is not the case. Can you take me to that earliest context so I can understand how and why you are the way that you are?

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 嗯，这是一个相当开场的问题，但我会尝试。我认为对我来说，塑造我生活以及可能构成我一部分的事件，真的始于我出生在伊朗。当时的伊朗正在现代化，成为一个现代社会，我的家人建立了一家相当大的工业公司，在伊朗每个人都非常引以为傲。我们在1978年革命中失去了这一切，我的家人不得不来到美国重建生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Uh quite the quite the starting questions but but but I'll try. I I think that for me the events that shaped my life and maybe a part of who I am really started with my being born in Iran and Iran at the time was modernizing becoming a modern society and my family built a pretty big industrial company that that everyone was quite proud of in Iran. We lost all of that with the revolution in 1978 and my family had to come to the US to rebuild their lives.

</details>

**主持人**: 你们不得不来到美国。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You had to come to the US.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 我们在那里不安全。我的一个叔叔实际上是刚被推翻的**沙阿**的内阁成员。有一次，革命卫队闯进了我们家后院。他们实际上是冲着我们邻居的房子去的，其中一支枪走火了，子弹穿过了我们的客厅，打碎了客厅的玻璃。在那一刻，我妈妈说：“我们在这里不安全。”所以我们不得不来到美国。我确实认为那件事在某种程度上塑造了我们，不仅是我，还有我的家人，因为我们都在努力重建我们在伊朗失去的一切，重建我们的经济生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: We were not safe there. One of my uncles actually was um a cabinet member of the **Shaw** who had just been toppled. And at one point, we had uh uh these revolutionary guards come into the backyard. They were actually going after our neighbor's house. Uh and one of their guns went off and bullets went through our living room. Uh shattered the glass in the living room. And at that point, my mom's like, "We're not safe being here." So, we had to come to the US. And I do think that event to some extent has shaped not just me but my family in that the rebuilding of our lives um of our uh economic lives to some extent where we're all trying to rebuild what we lost in Iran. Do

</details>

**主持人**: 你回首那段经历，能否从中找出一些在你身上留下的印记，这些印记在商业能力上定义了你？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: you look back on that and and can you identify any sort of fingerprints that were left on you from that time that have defined you in a business capacity?

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 我想我的核心是，我从不感到安全。你知道，失去一切的经历，对于孩子们来说，我告诉你，孩子们没关系，但看到我的父母失去一切，那真的摧毁了我父亲。你知道，那真的，他失去了他所认为的对世界的价值，那真的伤害了他的内心。我确实认为，在某种程度上，看到那一切让我走上了一条道路，我想要重建。我想要让我的家人感到骄傲。但同时，我从不，那种感觉，你知道，地毯被从脚下抽走，一切都付诸东流的感觉，那种感觉永远不会离开你。我认为美国人低估了这个地方在其理想中所代表的意义，对吧？那就是如果你建造了什么，它就是你的。有法治，它不会被夺走。这对于世界上大多数人口来说并非如此。所以我想对我来说，有一种建设的动力，同时，永远永远永远不要把任何事情视为理所当然，永远不要满足，因为一旦你把事情视为理所当然，那地毯就可能从你脚下被抽走。关于你父亲，有那么一段时间，他有几年，我想是六年，被困在伊朗，没有获得出境签证。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: I think at my core I never feel safe, you know, when the the experience of losing everything and and for the kids I I tell you it was fine for the kids, but seeing my parents lose everything and and it really destroyed my dad. You know, it really his losing his value to the world as he saw it um really hurt his inner being. And I do think to some extent seeing that has put me on a road where I want to rebuild. I want to make my family proud. But at the same time I never that feeling of having the floor, you know, the rug pulled out of you of building everything. That's a feeling that never leaves you. I think I think Americans underestimate what this place represents in its ideals, right? which is if you build something it's yours. There's a rule of law can't be taken away from you. That is not true for the majority of the population of the world. And so I think for me there's a drive to build and at the same time never ever ever taking anything for granted, never being satisfied because the minute you take things for granted then that rug can be pulled out from under you. on your father. There was a moment where he a couple of years, I think six years, where he got trapped in Iran and wasn't granted an exit visa.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yes.

</details>

**主持人**: 我想那时你母亲在纽约独自抚养你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And I imagine at that time your mother was raising you alone here in New York City.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 是的。在纽约市以北45分钟的**塔里敦**，她从一个从不需要工作的生活，变成了必须成为销售员来赚钱。她完全靠自己做到了，她真的挺身而出。所以我想这塑造了我们。在某些方面很困难。我，我想念我的父亲。我记得他离开时，他对我来说就像个巨人。然后他回来时，我正在上大学二年级，他仍然把我当成一个孩子。所以他想开车送我去大学，他也确实这样做了。然后他说他想和我一起玩。我说：“爸爸，你能不能离开这里？我想和我的朋友们一起玩。”我当时和我的朋友们在一起，我很高兴能回学校。看到一个男人变老了，这让人很难过。他在伊朗的那段时间对他来说真的很艰难。他回来时在飞机上心脏病发作。所以他在某种程度上是一个衰弱的人。但是，从那时起，我与他度过了许多许多年，这很棒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Yeah. In **Terry Town**, New York, 45 minutes north of New York City, but she she went from a life of never having to work to she had to become a salesperson to make some money and she did it all herself and she really stepped up. So I think it shaped us. It was difficult in some ways. I I miss my dad. I remember when he left, he was like a giant compared to me. And then when he came back, it was my sophomore year at college and he still saw me as a kid. And so he wanted to drive me to uh to college and and he did. And then he's like he wanted to hang out. I'm like, "Dad, can you get out of here? I want to hang out with my kids." I was with my friends. I was excited to go back to school. And it was just it it was sad seeing the change, you know, of a man who had gotten older. Uh his time in Iran was really tough on him. He had a heart attack on the plane coming back. So he was a diminished person to some extent. Um but it was great that I had many many years with him, you know, since then.

</details>

**主持人**: 他不在的时候，被困在伊朗无法离开的时候，你母亲**莉莉**……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: When he was away, when he was trapped around and wasn't able to exit, your mother **Lily**

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Yes.

</details>

**主持人**: 提到你很少提及他，但他回来时，你却哭了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: referenced how you didn't mention him much, but when he returned, you broke down in tears.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 莉亚，不，别这样。他是一个非常坚忍的人。没关系。抱歉。他几年前去世了，所以对我来说很难谈论。没关系。好吧，让我再试一次。他是一个非常坚忍的人。所以他把一切都藏在心里，我们也被教导要这样做。但是我们一起写信，那些信很美。他写诗。所以我通过信件和他保持联系。但是，嗯，表达情感和某种沮丧，不是我的家人会做的事情。你知道，你只是处理情况。所以，是的，我想我有点过于坚忍，然后偶尔会崩溃，就像你刚才看到的那样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Leah, no, don't be. He was a very stoic man. It's okay. Sorry. He passed away a couple years ago, so it's tough for me to talk about it. It's okay. All right, let me try again. He was a very stoked man. Um, so he kept it all inside and we were taught to do the same thing. Uh, but we wrote letters together and they're beautiful letters. He wrote poetry. So I communicated with him in Iran. But there's um expression of feelings and kind of uh frustration uh were not something that my family did. you know, you just dealt with a situation. And so, yeah, I I think I suffer from uh over stoism and then breaking down every once in a while, as you just saw.

</details>

**主持人**: 这对我采访过的那些在那种情感克制下长大并被灌输和模仿的男性来说，是一个熟悉的故事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It's a a familiar story of the the men that I've interviewed that grew up with that kind of sort of emotional composure enforced and um modeled to them.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 是的。我不知道这是否是被强制的，实际上并没有。是的。我们是一个充满爱的家庭，但我父亲非常谦逊。他不认为仅仅因为你身居高位，你就应该展现那种权力，你应该向所有人传达。我的家庭内部有一种坚忍，那就是不要抱怨。所以，这是一种奇怪的坚忍和爱的结合。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Yeah. I don't know if it was enforced like it wasn't actually. Yeah. like we were very loving family but my father was very humble. Um he did not believe that just because you're in a position of power you should kind of project that power you should communicate that to everyone and there was a stoicism inside my family which is don't complain you know um so they it was it was a weird combination of stoicism and love at the same time.

</details>

### 育儿与情感表达

**主持人**: 嗯，因为我还没当父亲。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How does um cuz I'm not a father yet.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Yes.

</details>

**主持人**: 但我快要当父亲了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: But I I'm approaching that.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 恭喜你。快了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Congratulations. Almost.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。快了。是的。我刚向未婚妻求婚，我们现在正在，你知道，希望能把孩子带到这个世界上。这也是我经常思考的问题之一，那就是我如何才能阻止我自己的坚忍，传给我的孩子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. Almost. Yeah. I've just proposed to my fiance and we're, you know, we're in the process now of, you know, bringing children into the world hopefully. And it's one of the things I think a lot about, which is how do I stop my own stoicism, passing on to my children.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 首先，为人父、为人父母是如此令人谦卑。你对如何抚养家人，孩子会变成什么样，心中有这样一幅图景。但他们只会成为他们自己，这是一个如此美丽的过程。起初会有一种警报。哦，天哪，我正在失去控制。你知道，我已经做了所有事情。你已经计划好了一切。我将这样抚养孩子。但随后现实生活会介入。这绝对是筋疲力尽的。所以，你可能执行了80%的计划，而20%是不完美的，因为你筋疲力尽，你还在工作，你还有事业。嗯，或者很多人都是如此。在某个时候，你看到这些孩子进入了一个完全意想不到的领域。对我来说，有一个时刻，我有点像一个控制狂。所以我想，这不好。他们有点在做自己的事情。但随后你退后一步，你会觉得，这绝对是美妙的。所以，就为人父母而言，我只想给出的建议是，多花时间陪伴孩子。你知道，这就是魔力，不是你做了什么，也不是具体的策略，而是你对他们的投入以及与他们共度的时间，其余的，你知道，你无法控制，但你能控制的是那种联系。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: First of all, fatherhood, parenthood is is so humbling. You have such a picture in your mind as to how you're going to raise your family, what your kids are going to be like. And they just become their own people and it's such a beautiful process to see. And at first there's this alarm. Oh my god, I'm losing control. You know, I've I've done everything. You've planned everything. This is how I'm going to raise kids. But then real life gets in the way. It is absolutely exhausting. So, you probably execute on 80% of your plan and you're 20% imperfect because you are exhausted and you're working and you got a career. Uh, or often some people do. And at some point, you see these kids kind of move off into this completely unexpected territory. And there's a point for me it was like I I'm a bit of a control freak. So, I'm like, this is not good. They're kind of doing their own thing. But then you you step back and you're like this is it's absolutely gorgeous what's happening. So the advice that I would just give in terms of being a parent is just spend the time with the kids. You know it is that is the magic is not what you do um or or the particular tactics but it's the investment in them and the time spent with them and the rest you know you can't control but what you can control is kind of that connection. H I um speaking of children, I went back and looked through lots of different photos of where you lived and where you grew up to try and get a picture of your world in an early context and all these photos look incredibly incredible. I think that was your fifth birthday.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，说到孩子，我回去看了很多你住过和长大的地方的照片，试图了解你早期世界的样子，所有这些照片看起来都非常棒。我想那是你五岁生日。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: H I um speaking of children, I went back and looked through lots of different photos of where you lived and where you grew up to try and get a picture of your world in an early context and all these photos look incredibly incredible. I think that was your fifth birthday.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 哦，哇。那时我还有头发。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Oh wow. I had hair back then.

</details>

**主持人**: 你有很多头发。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You had a lot of hair.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 我妈妈喜欢给我们穿上像小洋娃娃一样的衣服。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: My mom loved to dress us up in like little doll outfits.

</details>

**主持人**: 我还能说另一个你，看那个。我绝对不会对我的孩子那样做。四岁时在伦敦。你的另一张照片。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I can tell another one you lord. Look at that. I'm definitely not going to do that to my kids. age four in London. Another photo of you.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 你和你的表兄弟们在那里。另一张照片。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: You and your cousins there. Another photo.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 对我们来说，家人无处不在。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Family was everywhere for us.

</details>

**主持人**: 再次，另一张照片，头发剪得很漂亮。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And again, another one with a a beautiful haircut there.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 那是一个很棒的童年。太棒了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: It was a great childhood. It was amazing.

</details>

**主持人**: 我和你妈妈**莉莉**谈过。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I spoke to your mom, **Lily**.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 我希望，嗯，进展如何。我们拭目以待。她说，我会播放音频文件，让大家听听。他很小的时候告诉我，他想在世界上做一些重要的事情，他说变得富有不是他的首要任务，但做出改变是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: I hope uh well, how it go. We'll see. She said, I'll play the audio file just so people can hear it. when he was very little, he told me that he wants to do something important in the world and he said becoming wealthy is not his priority but making a change is

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 我不能说我记得那次对话，但我早期的一个经历真正给我留下了深刻印象，那就是我们去参观我父亲的一个工厂，家族工厂。我父亲负责设计工厂、建造工厂、运营工厂。那个工厂的人口对他以及我们的来访所表现出的尊重，以及他们对他的家人来访感到多么兴奋，这真的很酷。他对待他们的方式，他知道每个人的名字。他以如此的尊重对待他们。这真的给我留下了深刻印象。那里有一种关怀。这不是老板来了，然后人们感到恐惧。所以对我来说，那种能力，建立一种对很多人产生影响的生活，而且是积极的建设性影响。你得到了这些人的广泛尊重。这真的给我留下了深刻印象。所以当来到美国时，赚钱很重要。我不想胡说八道说，哦，我不在乎，因为我们失去了一切。所以我的第一份工作是投资银行。投资银行的目标是什么？玩得开心，但要赚钱，对吧？所以那对我来说是一个优先事项。但后来随着我在生活中成熟，当我意识到我有安全感时，好吧，是的，我知道我能做到。我能赚钱。我能养家糊口。我能赡养我的父母。然后，建立一种企业，拥有我父亲身上看到的那种感觉，那种与他的团队的联系，对我来说变得非常重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: I can't say I remember that conversation but the one of my early experiences that really imprinted on me was we went to visit one of my dad's It's factories, family factories. And my dad was in charge of designing factories, building them, operating them. And the respect that that population, the factory had for him and the visit and how excited they were that his family was visiting was just really cool. And and the way that he treated he knew everyone's name. He treated them with such respect. It just it really imprinted on me. There was this care. It wasn't the boss is coming and there's fear. And so for me like that ability to build a life where you have impact on a lot of people but it's it's positive kind of building impact. You have the broad respect of of these folks. It really imprinted on me. So I w I always wanted you know when we came to the states making money was important. I don't want to kind of BS and say like, oh, I didn't care about it because we lost everything. And so my first job was like, invest in banking. What's the goal of investment banking? Have fun, but make money, right? And so that was a priority for me. But then as I matured in life, as I knew I had safety in terms of, okay, yes, I know I can do that. I can make money. I can provide for my family. I can support my mom and dad. Then building kind of an enterprise, having that feeling that I saw with my father, that connection with his team uh was something that became really important to me.

**主持人**: 你来纽约的时候，八九岁。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 他在我生命中一直是一个重要人物。你知道，有这种，我想部分原因是我从未真正了解他这个人，因为我年轻的时候，他显然一直在工作。所以他偶尔会出现在晚餐时等等。我们总是全家人一起吃晚餐，然后他离开了，然后我工作了。所以我从未真正了解他这个人，但我不知道，有一种责任感。有一种希望，你知道，他可能在某个地方，或者他不在某个地方。但让我的父亲感到骄傲一直是我生命中一股强大的暗流。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: He's always been an important figure in uh in my life, you know, that there's this um and and I think part of it is that I never got to know him that well as an individual, you know, cuz he was obviously when I was younger, he was working all the time. So, he would show up once in a while for dinner, etc. We always had family dinners together and then he went away and then I worked. So, I never really got to know the person that he was, but I don't know there there's kind of this sense of duty. There's there's a hope that, you know, he's he's somewhere or maybe he's not someplace. But that making my father proud has always been a strong current undercurrent in my life.

### 工程思维与公司运营

**主持人**: 所以你9岁时来到了纽约市。嗯，你后来确实上了大学。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So, you're 9 years old, you've arrived in New York City. Um, you do end up going off to college sometime later.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 是的。我去了**布朗大学**，在那里学习工程学。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Yes. I went to Brown University, studied engineering there.

</details>

**主持人**: 你如何看待当时的选择，以及它对你人生轨迹的决定性作用？那个决定去那所大学学习那个科目。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How do you think about that choice at that time and how determinant that was of your trajectory in your life? That decision to go to that university and study that subject.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 我父亲总是说：“只要你是一名医生或工程师，你就可以做任何事情。”我选择了工程学。我只是喜欢工程学的解决问题方面，以及所有方程的层次等等。这些方程能够代表现实生活中的某些事物，然后神奇的是，现实生活中的事物会遵循理论上的预期，工程学的解决问题方面让我着迷。我非常喜欢它。我想它至今仍在为我服务。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: My father always said, "You can do anything in your life as long as either you're a doctor or an engineer." And I picked engineering. I just loved the problemolving aspect of engineering and all the layers of equations etc. and those equations being able to represent something in real life and then magically that something in real life following what it should theoretically like the problem solving aspect of engineering fascinated me. I absolutely loved it. Uh and I think it serves me to this day.

</details>

**主持人**: 工程师是好的首席执行官。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Engineers make good CEOs.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 优秀的首席执行官。如果你退后一步看，公司就是机器，对吧？它们是由人运行的机器，随着时间的推移，你实际上会尝试自动化一些人做的事情，然后你让人们去做那些无法自动化的新事情。我们是基于规则的，它既是一个有机体，又是一台机器，在某种程度上，首席执行官的工作就是工程学，我如何设置公司以实现我为股东、为董事会设定的目标。这是一个巨大的工程问题，对我来说，这非常迷人，将各个部分组合起来以达到你认为的目标，其中一件非常重要的事情是你必须选择正确的目标。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Great CEOs. If you step back, companies are just machines, right? They're they're machines that are run by people and over a period of time you actually try to automate some of the stuff that the people do and then you send the people off to do new stuff that can't be automated like we are rulesbased like it's it's an organism and it's a machine at the same time and to some extent the job of the the the CEO is engineering how do I set up the company to achieve the goals that you know I set for shareholders set for my board sets sets for it. It's a giant engineering problem and and to me that's like fascinating the putting together the pieces to get to what you perceive to be the goal and one of the really important things is you got to pick the right goals.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Mhm.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 嗯，那是一个巨大的解决问题的工程挑战，也是我工作中最迷人的部分之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Um that is one giant problem solving engineering challenge and it's one of the most fascinating parts of my job.

</details>

**主持人**: 我想深入探讨实际的公司建设，你如何组织一个组织使其成为一台运作良好的机器，设定目标等等。嗯，大学毕业后，你进入投资银行工作了一段时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I want to get into that the the practical company building how you organize um an organization to be a well functioning machine setting goals and all that stuff. Um after after college you go into investment banking for a period of time.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 是的，我在那里工作了八年，一开始是风险套利，然后也做并购咨询工作。

<details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Yeah I worked there for eight years in risk arbitrage to begin with and then mergers and acquisition advisory work as well.

### 投资银行的经验与“押注于人”

**主持人**: 我读到那段经历教会了你“押注于人”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And that experience I I was reading taught you about betting on people.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Yes.

</details>

**主持人**: 相对于其他，你说的“押注于人”是什么意思？为什么这很重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Versus other what do you mean by betting on people and why is that important?

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 嗯，这实际上是我从**赫伯特·艾伦**那里学到的一个教训，他当时经营着**艾伦公司**。这家公司是由**艾伦**家族创办的。他总是告诉我，当时我并没有真正听他的。他总是说：“永远要押注于人。公司会来来去去。有好公司，有坏公司，但优秀的人永远是优秀的。”**艾伦公司**之所以特别，其中一点就是，你知道，投资银行可能是一项竞争激烈的运动，但**艾伦公司**真正培养了与那些他们认为在潜力和品格上都很优秀的人的关系。在所有投资银行中，那种忠诚，那种对一个人的押注，然后伴随他们整个职业生涯，是那个地方运作的模式。嗯，这绝对是我在那里学到的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: It was uh it was actually a lesson that I learned from **Herbert Allen** who was running **Allen and Company** at the time. It it was the the uh the Allen's uh family started the company. And he always told me and and at the time I didn't really listen to him. He he always said, "Do always bet on people. Companies go. There are good companies, bad companies, but great people stay great all the time." And one of the things that made **Allan and Company** was really special. You know, investment banking can be a doggy talk sport, but **Allan and company** really cultivated relationships with people whom they perceived to be great both in terms of potential and in terms of character. And of all the investment banks, that loyalty, that making a bet on a person and then staying with them through their whole careers is a pattern of how that place works. Uh, and it's definitely something that that I learned there.

</details>

**主持人**: 一个人的品格中，哪些特质使他们有资格成为一个伟大的人？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What is it about one's character that makes them qualify as a great person?

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 你寻找成功、荣誉、忠诚，那些会告诉你他们要做什么的人，无论是好是坏，然后信守承诺的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: You look for success, honor, loyalty, people who will tell you what they're going to do, whether it's good or bad, and then follow through on their promises.

</details>

**主持人**: 努力工作。我很惊讶没有提到这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Hard work. I'm surprised that wasn't mentioned as

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 嗯。那伴随着成功而来。好的。对。天赋和努力工作。你把这两者结合起来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: well. That comes with success. Okay. Right. Talent and hard work. You put it those two together.

</details>

**主持人**: 你为什么离开**艾伦公司**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And why did you leave Allen in company?

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 我离开**艾伦公司**是因为我遇到了**巴里·迪勒**。他曾是我的客户。我们在一次大型交易中相遇，当时是对**派拉蒙**的一次不友好、敌意的要约收购。我想现在我们谈话时，**派拉蒙**又在发生另一次。他是我认为我会成为**艾伦公司**终身员工的人。我以为我会永远在那里。我的哥哥**凯夫**就是**艾伦公司**的终身员工。那是他一生中唯一的工作。但**巴里**是唯一一个我认为，如果我有机会为这个人工作，我就会抓住机会的人。我做到了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: I left Allen because I met **Barry Diller**. Uh, he was a client of mine. We got to meet in a big kind of deal uh unfriendly uh hostile tender offer for **Paramount** at the time. It's that there's another one happening I guess for **Paramount** uh now as we speak. And he was the one person I thought I was going to be Allen Lifer. I thought I was going to be there forever. My older brother **Cave** is an Allen Lifer. He has it's the only job he's had in his life. But **Barry** was the one person who I thought, you know, if I get a chance to work for this person, I'm I'm I'm going to jump at it. And I did.

</details>

**主持人**: 为什么？为什么是**巴里**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Why? Why Barry?

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 他，他太出色了。我的意思是，他曾经很出色。他现在也很出色。一个实干家。你知道。我是在他失败的情况下遇到他的。那是一次巨大的敌意要约收购。**维亚康姆**和**巴里**之间来回竞价。最终，**巴里**退出了，我们正在计划发布公告，你知道，你可以想象所有这些花哨的公关人员围坐在一张桌子旁。我们如何将失败呈现为胜利，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: He He's spectacular. I mean, he was spectacular. He is spectacular. A doer, you know. He he I I met him in a circumstance where he lost. It was it was this giant hostile tender offer. Bids going back and forth between uh the the winner **Viacom** and and **Barry**. Ultimately, **Barry** stepped away and we were planning an announcement, you know, and you can imagine all these like fancy PR people sitting around a table. How do we present a loss as a win, right?

</details>

**主持人**: 所以，他竞标一家公司，但没有成功。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So, he bid for a company. He didn't get it.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 他没有成功，然后他离开了。他没有成功是因为他离开了，事后看来这是一个错误。他本可以支付更多。然后在他离开的声明中，我想声明是“他们赢了，我们输了。下一个。”他是一个永不停歇的机器，就像第一天，我们输了，下一个，接下来是什么？我们走。这就是我想要为之工作的那种人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: He didn't get it and and he walked away. He didn't get it cuz he walked away, which in hindsight was a was a mistake. He could have paid more. Uh and then in the release where he walked away, uh I think the release was they won, we lost. next. And he was a constant motion machine like day one, we lost, next, what's next? Let's go. And that's the kind of person I wanted to work for.

</details>

**主持人**: 在商业中，失败是游戏的一部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: In business, losing is part of the game.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 绝对是。绝对是。但要说出来，你知道，不要胡说八道，不要说，哦，我们尽力了，情况如此。他们赢了，我们输了。下一个，没关系。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Absolutely. Absolutely. But then calling it out, you know, not bullshitting, not like, oh, we tried our best and the circumstances. They won, we lost. Next, it's okay.

</details>

**主持人**: 你输的方式重要吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Does it matter how you lose?

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 绝对重要。绝对重要。而且我发现公司有两件事做得不对：一是忽视失败，比如掩盖失败等等，对吧？然后有时又对失败过于执着，你知道，检查它，发生了什么，让我们做个总结，让我们开会，哪里出了问题等等。对我来说，这介于两者之间，那就是认识到你为什么失败，认识到你失败了，说出来，因为说出来很重要，分析它，然后继续前进。就像，让我们继续前进。下次你希望能学到某种判断力来避免那种失败，但这并不意味着你会完全避免失败。如果你不尝试，你就不会错过。你就不会失败。所以对我来说，就是不断前进，不断尝试，失败，学习，下一个，失败，学习，下一个。这种持续的运动是我想要看到的。嗯，这种持续的运动和学习让我兴奋。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Absolutely it does. that absolutely it does it it's and and I find companies guilty of two things like one is ignoring losses like papering over losses etc right and then sometimes being obsessive about the loss you know inspecting it what happened let's do a summary let's meet what went wrong etc and and you know for me it's somewhere in the middle which is recognize why you lost recognize that you lost say it because it's important to say it, analyze it, but then move on. Like, let's move on. And the next time you hope to have learned some kind of judgment to avoid that kind of a loss, but it doesn't mean you're going to avoid losing at all. Like, if you're not taking shots, you're not missing. You're you're not losing. So, for me, it's constantly moving and taking your shots, losing, learning next, losing, learning next. That constant motion is what I want to see. Um that constant motion and learning is what excites me.

</details>

**主持人**: 这既是商业建议，也是普遍的人生建议，因为我遇到很多人，他们来找我提问，通常问的问题听起来很像你刚才说的。这涉及到处理拒绝，处理失败，以及这种失败有时会伴随他们十年，有时是十五年，阻碍他们，伤害他们的信心，意味着他们不再尝试，这可能导致一种信心螺旋式下降。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: This is business advice but also life advice generally because a lot of people um who I meet who come up to me and ask me questions about things often ask questions that sound a lot like what you just said. It's dealing with rejection, dealing with taking an L, and how that L then stays with them sometimes for a decade, sometimes for 15 years, and and holds them back, hurts their confidence, means that they don't take it any more shots, and this can cause a sort of a downward confidence spiral.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 完全正确。听着，我说的很厉害，但我要告诉你，在我的个人生活中，我无法处理拒绝。我很难处理拒绝。职业生活，完全没问题。所以归根结底，我们都是人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Totally. And and listen, I'm I'm talking a big game, but I would tell you in my personal life, I can't deal with rejection. I have a really hard time dealing with rejection. Professional life, no problem whatsoever. So it's like in the end we're all humans after all.

</details>

**主持人**: 你在个人生活中处理拒绝有困难？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You have a a difficulty dealing with rejection in your personal

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 非常。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: very much. Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 什么样的拒绝？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What kind of rejection?

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 任何形式的拒绝、冲突，这都是我一生都在与之抗争的事情。因为我是较小的表兄弟之一，因为我是最小的弟弟，我就是没有权利。所以我随波逐流。随波逐流意味着你顺应潮流等等。我没有惹麻烦，这在我的个人生活中一直伴随着我。在我的职业生活中，我在这方面没有那么多麻烦。我想我的职业生活在某种程度上是一种伪装，因为我可以变得有侵略性。我可以失败等等。这是我的妻子**西德**真正帮助我的事情，但它确实是我个人生活中普遍避免冲突的一面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Any kind of rejection conflict like it's it's something that has been uh that I fought my whole life which is because I was one of the younger cousins because I was a youngest brother. I just kind of didn't have rights. So I was I went with the flow. And going with the flow means you're going with the current etc. I didn't cause trouble and that has followed me in my personal life. In my professional life, I don't have as much trouble there. I guess my professional life to some extent is a mask because I get to be aggressive. I get to lose, etc. It's something that **Sid**, my wife, has really helped me with, but it is something in my personal life that generally I'm conflict avoidant.

</details>

**主持人**: 你在个人生活中避免冲突。有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You're conflict avoidant in your personal life. Interesting.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 是的。是的。当然。嗯。这在人际关系中不好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. Hm. That's not good in a relationship.

</details>

**主持人**: 不。不。这就是为什么**西德**在帮助我。我现在好多了。我好多了。但它……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: No. No. That's why that's why Sid's helping me out. I'm much better now. I'm much better. But it's

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 当我处理这些问题时，我必须与自己抗争。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: it's when I take those issues on, I have to fight myself.

</details>

**主持人**: 有些核心问题，你知道，如果我们之间有问题。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: There's some core, you know, if if you and I were having an issue. Yeah.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 如果我坐下来对你说：“嘿，我对X或Y不满意。”我能感觉到我内心深处有一个声音说：“算了。”但这正是怨恨滋生，以及人际关系在长时间内开始走向错误方向的方式。所以这确实是我核心的一部分，但我积极地与之抗争，而且我正在变得更好，但我仍然在学习的旅程中。我告诉你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: And I was sitting down with you and saying, "Hey, I'm not I'm not happy about X or Y." I can feel there's a core of me saying, "Just let it go." But that's how resentment builds and that's how relationships um over a long period of time start moving the wrong way. So it is something that is at my core but I actively fight uh and I'm getting better at it but I'm still on a learning journey there. I'll tell you that

### 从投资银行到Expedia CEO

**主持人**: 最终你成为了**Expedia**的首席执行官，在你之前有几位首席执行官，但你成为了第三位，并接管了那家公司。从投资银行到首席执行官，这是一份非常不同的工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: eventually you go on to becoming the CEO of **Expedia** after um there was a couple of CEOs that came before you but you became the third and took that company on. Very different job going from investment banking to being a CEO.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 是的。是的。当时有一段旅程，因为我从银行转到负责交易，我知道我喜欢公司的运作方式。我喜欢投资银行的一点是，我在那里看到了很多东西。我看到了非常聪明的人，非常酷的公司建立起来，但我无法跟随他们的旅程。我嫉妒那些首席执行官们正在进行的旅程。所以当并购成为在公司工作和建立公司的桥梁时，我从并购转到了首席财务官，因为这在某种程度上是金融，但它也是首席执行官的合作伙伴，帮助首席执行官建设。所以我一直都知道我想要去的方向，那就是，嘿，在某个时候，我真的想成为一名运营者。然后我有了接管**Expedia**的机会。当时的首席执行官**埃里克·布拉什福德**有点说：“是的，大公司的事情，不适合我。”所以他辞职了。老实说，**巴里**没有其他选择。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Yeah. Yeah. Now there there was a journey there because I went from banking to running deals and I knew that I knew that I I liked how companies worked. The thing that I liked about investment banking was that I got to see a lot there. I got to see really smart people, really cool companies build, but I couldn't go along with that journey. I was jealous of the journey that these CEOs were were moving on. So then when M&A was a bridge to work at a company and build uh the company, I moved from M&A to CFO, chief financial officer because that's uh that's that's to some extent finance, but it's also being the CEO's partner and helping the CEO build. So I I always knew the direction that I want to go in, which is hey, at some point I want to actually be an operator. And then I had the opportunity to take over **Expedia**. the CEO at the time, **Eric Blashford**, kind of said, "Yeah, big company thing, not for me." So, he resigned. And honestly, **Barry** didn't have an alternative. Who

</details>

**主持人**: **巴里**是**IA**的董事长兼首席执行官，**IA**是后来成为**Expedia**的母公司，**IA Travel**的负责人辞职了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: was the owner of **Barry** was the CEO and chairman of **IA**, which was a parent company of what became **Expedia**, I travel. The head of **IC Travel** resigned.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 我举手说：“也许我能做到。”**巴里**当时很绝望。他没有其他人选。所以他提拔我担任**IA Travel**的首席执行官，而**IA Travel**当时正经历一些困难时期。所以我们把它分拆成了**Expedia**。那就是我成为上市公司**Expedia**首席执行官的时候，我搬到了西雅图的荷兰。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: I raised my hand. I said, "Maybe I could do it." **Barry** was desperate. He had no one else. So he promoted me to be CEO of **IA travel** and **IC travel** was going through some difficult times. So we spun it off as at at **Expedia**. So that's when I became the CEO of **Expedia**, the public company and I moved to the Netherlands of of uh Seattle.

</details>

**主持人**: 在你担任首席执行官之前的工作中，你一直在收购企业。所以并购，你一直在收购公司。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: In your job just before you took on that role as CEO, you were buying businesses. So M&As, mergers and acquisitions, you were buying companies. Yes.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 你收购了一些什么公司？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: What are some of the companies that you bought?

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 哦，我们收购了很多公司。我们收购了**Ticketmaster**。我们收购了**match.com**，收购了**Expedia Hotels.com**。这一切都围绕着**巴里**和我着迷的主题：商业的在线化。你知道，那是在90年代末、2000年代初。我们亲眼看到了它的发生，真正始于家庭购物，对吧？那是一个平板屏幕，一台电视，你提供产品，人们打电话购买这些产品，通过电子方式。然后媒介改变了。媒介从电视屏幕变成了互联网屏幕，你不再打电话，你可以使用HTTP。所以，当媒介改变时，我们看到了利用平台变化的机会。所以**match.com**本质上在过去，你知道，你有在线约会，但你会打电话，你会说我的名字是**达**，我身高6英尺2英寸，你描述你自己，你会听到其他录音，然后根据看起来不错的人进行匹配。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Oh, we bought a lot of companies. Uh we bought **ticket master**. Uh we bought **match.com** uh bought **Expedia Hotels.com** and and it was all about the theme that **Barry** and I were uh fascinated with was the movement of commerce online. You know, it was it was during that uh time. It was the late late 90s, early 2000. And and we saw it happening with our very own eyes really with home shopping, right? It was it's a flat screen. It was a television and you were offering products and people were calling up buying those products electronically and just the medium changed. The medium changed from a TV screen to an internet screen and instead of calling you could use uh HTTP uh and so while the medium changed we kind of saw this opportunity to take advantage of the of the change of platform. So **match.com** essentially in the olden days you know you had online dating but you would call a number and you'd be like my name is Da and I'm 6'2 and this you describe yourself and you hear other kind of uh recordings and you would get matched up based on someone who seemed nice

</details>

**主持人**: 所有这些都转移到了线上。那就是**Batch.com**。**Ticket Master**也是一样。你知道，在过去，你会去**Tower of Records**。你去过**Tower of Records**吗？你太年轻了。是的。所以有这些叫做唱片店的东西，他们也有一个柜台，在那里他们会卖演唱会门票。所以你要么打电话订演唱会门票，要么亲自去买。太棒了。而且有排队，**Tower Record**的排队。那是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: and all of that just moved online. That was what **Batch.com** was. Same thing with **Ticket Master**. You know in the olden days you would go to a **Tower of Records**. Have you ever been to a **Tower of Records**? You're too Yeah. So there were these things called record stores and they also had a desk where they would sell concert tickets. So you would either call for a concert ticket or you would physically go and buy one. Amazing. And there were lines, **Tower Record** lines. What's that?

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 所有这些都精确地转移到了线上。旅行也是一样，对吧？你会打电话给旅行社。所以所有这些，零售和电话商务都转移到了在线商务。我们识别出了早期进行这种转变的参与者，个人服务、票务、旅行是我们选择的领域，因为当时**亚马逊**正在做其他所有事情，比如实体履约。所以我们追求的本质上是不需要实体履约的电子交易，那就是旅行，因为你知道，它是一种虚拟商品，票务，**match.com**，它是个人服务。所以这种疯狂背后是有规律的，可以说，但我们出去收购了所有这些公司。那是一个非常棒的时期。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: And all of that exactly moved online. And same thing with travel, right? You would call a travel agent and so all of there was this movement of retail and phone commerce to online commerce. And we identified the early players to make that shift and personals, ticketing, travel were the ones that we went with went for because at the time **Amazon** was doing everything else like physical fulfillment. So what we were going for were essentially electronic transactions that did not require physical fulfillment and that was travel because you know it's a virtual good ticketing uh **match.com** which which was personal. So there was a pattern around the madness so to speak but we went out and bought all these companies. It was a really great time.

</details>

### 识别优秀公司与转型机遇

**主持人**: 我有两个问题由此产生。第一个是，我真的很想了解你如何寻找人才，或者你如何看待一家优秀的公司。我们是看公司文化吗？是看创始人吗？还有别的什么吗？是盈利能力吗？另一个问题是，我真的很想知道你人生中的这段时期以及之后，教会了你如何发现机遇和转型，因为那是一个技术转型的时刻。我认为有一种特定的模式识别能力可以培养，以便在这种充满巨大怀疑的转型时刻知道该押注什么。互联网将成为一切。所以有两个问题。一个是，你如何发现优秀的公司？第二个是，转型中的模式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I've got two questions that emerge there. One one is again I'm really interested to understand how you would look for talent or how what how you think about what a great company is. Are there like we we looking at the company culture? Were we looking at the founders? Was there something else? Was it the profitability? And the other one is just really intrigued as to what this period of your life and thereafter taught you about how to spot opportunity and transition cuz that is a transitional moment of technology. And I think there is a certain pattern recognition one can develop as to like know what to bet on in these moments of transition where there's huge skepticism. The internet's going to be anything. It's a so two questions. One is like how do you spot great companies and then the second is like patterns in transition.

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 所以我想说它们是相关的，那就是我们通过观察谁在这些转型中处于领先地位来发现优秀的公司。你知道这些转型是困难的。你无法准确预测事情会走向何方，速度有多快，你应该投入多少，回报是什么，市场会有多大。但当时有一些公司正在成为领导者，我们就会识别出这些领导者，然后打电话给他们说我想来和你谈谈。就是这样。在某种程度上，这是一个自我强化的循环，那就是优秀的管理团队和优秀的创始人是那些能够识别机会并比其他人更快地抓住机会，识别机会并比其他人更快地执行机会的人。所以在某种程度上，处于领先地位的公司当然拥有最好的管理团队和最好的创始团队。当这两者匹配时，我们就会行动。然后我要告诉你的最后一件事，就这些模式识别而言，那就是我们从未因为公司便宜而完成一笔成功的交易。我们实际上为我们收购的每一家优秀公司都支付了过高的价格，但我们支付的过高价格是基于当时市场认为的，而不是现实最终证明的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: So they're I'd say that they're related which is um we would spot great companies just by observing who is taking the lead in these transitions. You know these transitions are difficult. You can't predict exactly where things are going, how quickly they're going, how much should you invest, what's a return, what uh what the what the market how large is the market going to be. But there were companies that were emerging as the leaders and we would just I just identify the leaders and call call these folks up and say I want to come in and talk to you. Like that was that was it. And to some extent it's a self-reinforcing cycle which is yes the great management teams and the great founders were the ones who were able to identify the opportunity and hit that opportunity faster than anyone else recognize that opportunity and execute on that opportunity faster than anyone else. So to some extent the companies who were in the lead of course had the best management teams and had the best founding teams. And when those two things matched, that was when we jumped. And then the the last thing I would tell you in terms of these pattern uh recognitions is that we never completed a successful deal because we got the company cheap. We actually overpaid for every single great company that we bought, but we overpaid based on what the market thought at the time,

**主持人**: 而不是现实最终证明的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: not what the reality turned out to be.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 所以我确实认为，对我来说，模式识别的一个方面是，人类以线性方式思考成功和转型，因为时间是线性的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: So I do think one of the kind of pieces of pattern recognition with me is just humans think about success and transitions in a linear way because time is linear.

</details>

**主持人**: 你会是那种不只是这样思考的人吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Would you someone that doesn't just they think of it going like this?

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 是的。你知道，一切都以这种方式发展，对吧？你的日程安排相对线性，对吧？你每天睡七个小时。你的生活是线性的。但公司和公司的成功以及公司的发展势头，特别是对于新技术而言，如果有一种技术真正优于另一种技术，在虚拟世界中，没有任何摩擦阻碍它，这些公司会以指数级的方式增长，最终也会以指数级的方式增加其价值。所以，当大多数人看待事物时，他们展望未来时，他们看到的是这样，而实际发生的是这样，这就是机会所在。这就是曲棍球棒曲线和直线之间的差距。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Yeah. You know it's it's the everything kind of moves this way, right? Your your schedule is relatively linear, right? It's you sleep seven hours a day. Like your life is a linear life. But company and company success and company momentum, especially with new technologies where if there's a technology that's truly better than the other technology within the virtual world, there's absolutely no friction holding it back, the these companies move in an exponential way in terms of their growth and ultimately in terms of their value. So whereas most people kind of see things they they when they project out to the to the future they see this what actually happens is this and that's where the opportunity is. It's the it's the spread between the hockey stick and kind of the straight line.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Mhm.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 嗯，人们很难理解这一点。所以，你知道，我们识别出的那些公司就是那种曲棍球棒曲线。在线旅行是曲棍球棒曲线，个人服务是曲棍球棒曲线，票务是曲棍球棒曲线。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Uh and it's very difficult for people to process that. And so that was, you know, those were the companies that we identified that hockey stick. And online travel was a hockey stick, personals was a hockey stick, ticketing was a hockey stick.

</details>

**主持人**: 我听说过**杰文斯悖论**吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I heard about the is it Jeans paradox?

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Yes.

</details>

**主持人**: 我认为这与你所说的有些重叠。当事情变得更容易、更快、更便宜时，人们做它们的频率不是递增，而是异常频繁。我的意思是，这就是**Uber**的定义，我们可以在某个时候谈谈，它最初是作为一种黑色出租车服务，可以说是一种黑色轿车服务而建立的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Which I think kind of sort of overlaps with what you're saying there. When things become easier, faster, cheaper, people do them not incrementally more, but ex like exceptionally more often. I mean that that's the definition of **Uber** and we can get to that at some point was uh originally it was built as a black cab service so to speak a black car service.

### Uber的诞生与杰文斯悖论

**主持人**: 你能告诉我那是从哪里来的吗？因为很多人，历史已经向前发展，人们已经忘记了它是如何诞生的故事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Can you tell me that's that where it came from? Because a lot of people history has now moved forward that people have forgotten the story of how it came to be.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 在某种程度上，它确实是，嗯，在很大程度上，它的创立是在我之前，但它是**加勒特·坎普**，他是创始人之一，他有这个想法，我想它诞生于巴黎。那是一个下雪天在巴黎，他们找不到一辆黑色轿车，当时有一群年轻的科技人员，他们想，如果能拿起手机叫一辆黑色轿车，那该多酷啊。这就是核心想法，你可以用手机叫一辆黑色轿车。他带来了**特拉维斯·卡兰尼克**，**特拉维斯**是运营者和创始人。就你的观点和**杰文斯悖论**而言，在某种程度上，人们认为黑色轿车市场的规模有多大，它只有几十亿美元，或者出租车行业的规模有多大，它也只有几十亿美元。但他们当时没有看到的是，当你改进便利性，如果你从根本上让某件事变得更方便或更便宜，市场就会超出你的计算而扩大。所以**Uber**现在的规模和体量远远超出了最初的黑色轿车和/或出租车市场。今天的公司是**杰文斯悖论**的结果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Now to some extent it was it well to a large extent it was that the founding was was before me but it was um uh **Garrett Camp** who was one of the founders had this idea uh and I think it was born in Paris. It was like a snowy day in Paris and they couldn't find a black car and it was a bunch of young young tech guys and like how cool would it be to like pick up my phone and call a black car and that was the the core idea which is hey you can use your phone to call a black car he brought on uh **Travis Kalanick Travis** was the operator and and the founder and to to your point and **Jeban's paradox** to some extent people thought well what's the size of the black car market place and it was a couple billion dollars or what's the size of the taxi industry and it was uh more than a couple of billion dollars. But what they didn't see at the time was that as you improve the con if you radically make something either more convenient or cheaper, the market expands beyond how you calculate it. So the **Uber** size and scale now is way beyond the original marketplace of black cars and or taxis. It it's the company the company today is a result of **Jeban's paradox**

</details>

**主持人**: 时机。我们常常不怎么考虑时机的运气。运气是一个有趣的词，但时机以及其他一些基础因素对于像**Uber**这样的公司能够存在是多么重要。当你考虑**Uber**的时机时，有哪些基础因素使其成为可能？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: timing. We often um we often don't think much about the luck of timing. Luck is an interesting word to use, but how important timing is and other sort of foundational factors are in enabling a company like **Uber** to exist. When you think about the timing of **Uber**, what are the sort of the foundations that made it possible?

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 嗯，那是一场移动革命。那是移动数据技术，**iPhone**的出现。在早期，**特拉维斯**的其中一个天才之处在于，他会雇佣这些市场经理，他们会成为新城市的总经理，他们会扩展到这些城市。他们会带着一包**iPhone**去城市，把**iPhone**送给黑色轿车司机，让他们加入**Uber**，因为当时很多人都没有智能手机。所以智能手机的出现是那种美丽的、时机恰到好处的魔力，然后是那个创始团队的积极进取，他们明白这里有一个模式，我要把这个模式复制到全世界，并尽可能多地筹集资金，以便比其他人更快地实现目标。那就是魔力。但它，你知道，再次，是的，其中有运气成分，但如果那个创始团队没有那么积极地进行“闪电扩张”（blit scaling），这是一个人们普遍使用的术语，遍布全世界，那么公司就不会是今天的样子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Well, it was it was a mobile revolution. It was um mobile data technology, the **iPhone** coming together. In the early days, one of the geniuses of Tra of **Travis** was he would hire these market managers who would be GMs of new cities that they would expand into. and they would literally go to the city with a bag full of **iPhones** and give away **iPhones** to black car drivers to get them to come on **Uber** because at the time a lot of them didn't have you know they they didn't have smartphones so to speak. So the onset of the of the smartphone was that kind of that beautiful magic of timing coming together and then aggressiveness of that founding team to understand that there's a pattern here and I'm going to replicate that pattern all the world and raise as much capital as I have to to get there faster than anyone else. That was the magic. But it was, you know, again, it's, yes, there's luck in there, but if that founding team hadn't been as aggressive in, you know, blit scaling, which is a term that folks used, uh, all around the world, company wouldn't be what it is today.

### 领导力转型与透明文化

**主持人**: 你从投资银行转型到**Expedia**，先是首席财务官，然后是首席执行官。你知道，听着，商业中有一个刻板印象，那就是投资银行家和首席财务官不一定能成为最好的首席执行官，因为他们可能会……

**主持人**: Your transition out of investment banking into **Expedia**, CFO, then CEO. You know, listen, there's a stereotype in business that um investment bankers and CFOs don't necessarily make the best CEOs because of

**主持人**: 他们可能会刻板地过度金融化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: they might stereotypically over financialize

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 过度金融化，可能风险规避程度较低，可能，你知道，诸如此类的事情。当我与**巴里**交谈时，他确实说了以下的话。我播放给你听，因为由他来说更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: over financial maybe be less riskaverse, maybe be less, you know, those kinds of things. And when I spoke to **Barry**, he did say the following. I'll just play it for you because it's uh better coming from him. H

</details>

**Barry Diller**: 他不是一个真正的领导者，因为他之前的职业生涯一直都在金融领域。所以他还没有真正拥有管理人员的经验或机会。这对他的影响很大，但他掌握了它。他并没有花很长时间。他掌握了如何成为一名领导者，他掌握了如何对一家公司承担最终责任。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Barry Diller**: he was not an actual leader uh because he had uh his career up until then has had been on the financial side of things. So he really had not yet had the experience or opportunity to manage people. That came in a difficult way to him and he mastered it. It didn't take him all that long. He mastered how to become a leader and he mastered how to take ultimate responsibility for a company.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 是的，在**巴里**手下成长，而且顺便说一句，如果没有他作为我的领导者，向他学习，我不会有今天。他不是那种指导型的人。但我说，真正塑造我的经历，就**Expedia**而言，是我确实以一个更像金融领导者的身份进入。我们在**Expedia.com**的领导层失败了。我雇佣了一个人，我不得不解雇第一个人。完全是一场灾难。所以我在为我们最大的业务招聘方面是0比2。这项业务占我们利润的50%，我在招聘方面是0比2。所以我去找**巴里**和董事会，我说：“好吧，如果我第三次招聘最大的业务负责人又失败了，那你们就应该解雇我。”**巴里**很快同意了，是的，我们会的。所以我说，显然，我对这份工作了解不够，无法找到合适的人。所以我想我必须自己担任这份工作6个月到一年，以了解这份工作到底需要什么，然后我才能去找到那个人。所以，结果是，我想是五六年，我同时管理着控股公司**Expedia Inc.**，这是一家上市公司，我还管理着**Expedia.com**。我是公司最大部门的总裁。那段经历教会了我我的运营能力。那段经历实际上教会了我如何运营一家公司？如何管理一些事情？这与资本配置以及所有人们所从事的金融魔法是完全不同的技能。那很重要。但我发现的是，运营一家公司，领导一家公司，组织它，运营它，设定目标，组建合适的团队。那是我喜欢的工作部分。所以，我花了一段时间才达到那里。我的整个生活，我早期的整个职业生涯都在金融领域。我喜欢它，但我没有找到我的真爱，那就是运营和管理公司，以及管理一家科技公司，直到我职业生涯的后期。嗯，我想在某种程度上，我现在两者兼备。我有金融部分，因为它必须奏效。但业务的运营和领导部分是我喜欢的事情。看着**巴里**承担责任，敢于冒险，逆流而上，他始终如一地积极进取，我想这让我成为了一个比如果我换了另一个老板会更好的运营者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Yeah, it was um growing up under **Barry** was was and and by the way I I wouldn't be where I am today without not him as a mentor because he's not like a mentoring kind of guy but him as my leader learning from him. But I say that the experience that really really shaped me uh as it relates to **Expedia** was I did come in as more of a financial leader. our leadership at **Expedia.com** failed. I hired a I had to fire the first uh person. I hired a second person. Complete disaster. And so I was 0 for two in terms of hiring for our largest business. This business was 50% of our profits and I was 0 for two in uh in hiring. And so I went to **Barry** and the board and I said, 'Well, if I miss hiring the third person to run the biggest parts of our business, then you should fire me. **Barry** quickly agreed, yes, of course we will. So I said, obviously, I don't understand enough about the job to find the right person. So I think I've got to take the job myself for 6 months to a year to understand what what is it that the job entails for me to then go and and find that person. And so for what turned out to be I think it was five or six years I ran both the holding company **Expedia Inc.** which is a public company and I ran **Expedia.com**. I was president of the largest part of the company. That experience taught me my operating troughs. That experience actually taught me how is it that you operate a company? How is it that you run something? And that's a very different skill set from capital allocation and you know all the financial uh wizardry that people embark on. That's important. But the what I discovered was operating a company, leading a company, organizing it, operating it, setting up the goals, getting the right team together. That's the part of the job that I loved. So it it it took me a while to get there. Like my whole life, my whole early career was in this financial sector. which I enjoyed, but I didn't find my true love, which is operations and running companies and running a technology company until way, way later in my career. Uh, and I think to some extent now I've got both. I've got that financial part cuz it has to work. But the operations and the leadership part of the business is something that that I love. And watching **Barry** take responsibility, take shots, go against the grain, um, as aggressively as he consistently did, I think has made me a much better operator than what the counterfactual would be if I had another boss.

**主持人**: 上任三个月后，人力资源主管告诉你，你把人吓坏了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Three months into that role, the head of HR told you that you were scaring people.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 我都忘了这事了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: I've forgotten about that.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 我想那是我的工作。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: I think that was my job. Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 当时的情况是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What's the context there?

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 你知道，当时的情况是，首先，科技行业的转型真的很难。我们之前谈到过动量效应，当动量是积极的。在科技行业，如果动量转为负面，要扭转局面异常困难。你知道**雅虎**还在挣扎，但它曾经是一家伟大的公司，你看看它现在在哪里。当你做错时，后果是残酷的。而且总是比你想象的要花更长的时间。这又回到了我之前谈到的线性与指数的问题。就像上升曲线是指数级的，下降曲线也是指数级的。最初几年看起来很糟糕，但并没有那么糟糕。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: You know the context was that I first of all turnarounds in technology are really hard. Uh we were talking about the momentum thing where momentum is positive. In the technology sector if momentum turns negative it is remarkably difficult to turn it around. You know **Yahoo** is hanging on but it was the great company and you see where it is now. It's brutal when you get it wrong. And it always takes longer than you think. And it goes to, you know, what I was talking about linear versus exponential. Just like the curves up are exponential, curves down are exponential as well. The first couple of years look bad, but they're not that bad.

</details>

**主持人**: 但你心里知道，十年后，那将是一场彻底的灾难。嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: But you know in your mind that 10 years from now, it's going to be a [ __ ] disaster. Mhm.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 所以我在**Expedia**看到的是一家技术公司，其技术引擎已经损坏。代码库老旧，没有得到再投资。技术领导层在混日子。这真的让我警觉。我从**巴里**那里学到的领导力方面的一点是，当你听到警钟响起，当你看到一些事情，当你看到一个模式时，你必须行动。你不能等一秒钟。所以在我看来，一旦我弄清楚，哦天哪，这真的是一次转型。这不是一家我需要调整的公司。如果这家公司我不迅速而果断地行动，它就会开始走上指数衰减曲线。我必须迅速行动，在那一刻，我从**巴里**那里学到的技能之一是透明度。他总是想了解问题的根源。他不需要总结，而且无论这个根源在哪里都无关紧要。是初级分析师还是总裁？他想从根源那里听到，因为他不想失去的是问题的真实性。你知道，当这里有一个问题，然后它通过分析师、助理、副总裁、高级副总裁等等，等你作为首席执行官得到总结时，它已经失去了一切。通常他们的级别会说：“嘿，我们真的想告诉他们那个吗？我们为什么不这样措辞呢？”等等。所以你作为首席执行官的整个生活，在某种程度上是你的团队希望你看到的世界版本。如果你有一个好的团队，通常它与现实更接近，但你受制于你的团队和传递给你的信息流。所以**巴里**总是想追溯到根源。他会直接跳过层级，跳过层级，直达想法的核心，然后一旦他做到了，他就会行动，而且会迅速行动。对我来说，我一直坚持这一点，但我也将其反过来运用，那就是我能够依赖从你那里得到真实情况的方式之一，就是我对你诚实，对吧？人类是很好的“测谎仪”，可以说。当你作为首席执行官，你和你的员工交谈，你说了所有那些商业套话，我们正在做这个，但上个季度我们遇到了一些挑战等等，他们看到你在胡说八道，那么他们为什么要告诉你真相呢？如果他们的老板不告诉他们真实情况，他们为什么要向老板反馈真实情况呢？所以对我来说，这几乎是一种自我防御机制，作为老板，我会告诉你正在发生什么，因为这是我能从你那里得到残酷真相的唯一方式。否则，你会自我过滤。你会想，我不想让**达拉**知道发生了这件事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: So what I saw with **Expedia** was a technology company whose technology engine was broken. Codebase was old, had not been reinvested in. Technology leadership was coasting. And that really alarmed me. And one of the things that I learned from **Barry** in terms of leadership is that when you know a bell is rung, when when you when you see something, when you see a pattern, you have to act. You can't wait for a second. So in my mind, once I figured out, oh my god, this really is a turnaround. This isn't like a company that I've got to tune. this company if I don't move and move hard and fast is is going to start on that exponential decay curve. I had to move quickly and at that point and and I am one of the skills that I learned from **Barry** is transparency. It's like whenever he wanted to understand an issue he wanted to go to the source. He didn't want a summary and it didn't matter where that source was. Is it a junior analyst or a president? He wanted to hear from the source because what he didn't want to lose is lose the fidelity of the issue. You know, when there's an issue here and then it goes through the analyst and the associate and the vice president and an SVP and whatever, by the time it's summarized for you as the CEO, it's just it's lost everything. And usually their levels are like, "Hey, do we really want to tell them that? Why don't we phrase it this way, etc." So your whole life as a CEO is kind of a it's a version of the world that your team wants you to see. And if you got a good team, usually it has more to do with reality than not, but you are subject to your team and the information flow that that gets to you. And so **Barry** always wanted to go to the source. He would just cut through levels, cut through levels, get to the core of the idea, and then once he did, he would move and he would move fast. And for me, I've kind of I have held on to that, but I've also turned it the other way, which is one of the ways in which I can depend on getting the real [ __ ] from you is my being honest with you, right? and and human beings are good [ __ ] you know, kind kind of meter so so to speak. And and when you're the CEO and you're talking to your staff and you're giving all the, you know, the business talk and we're doing this, but the last quarter we had some certain challenges and this and that, they see you bullshitting them and so why the hell should they tell you the truth, right? if their if their boss isn't telling them the good stuff, why should they give the good stuff back to the boss? So, for me, it it was almost like a self-defense mechanism that as a boss, I'm going to tell you what's going on because that's the only way I can drag the hard truths back from you. Cuz otherwise, you're going to filter yourself. You're gonna be like, I don't want **Dart** to know this happened.

</details>

**主持人**: 但你担心他们可能无法接受真相吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: But do you ever worry that they might not be able to deal with the truth?

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 那他们就可以离开。我想这就是我的人力资源主管当时说的。我把人吓得要命，因为我说我们这里有一个真正的问题，我们必须团结起来。我想，你知道，对我来说，一个好的决策框架是，如果我犯了错误，我想在哪里犯错误？对吧？所以如果我打算在我的公司犯错误，我会在说出真相并可能吓跑某人方面犯错误。我会接受这一点，因为如果那个人不想面对真相，如果他或她不愿意战斗，那么他们就应该去别的地方。他们可以过得很好。我相信他们可以有一个好的职业生涯等等。所以对我来说，作为一名领导者，我一直坚信透明度，部分原因是我认为这样可以吸引合适的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Then they can leave. And and I think that that's so I think that's what my head of HR was saying. I was scaring the [ __ ] out of people cuz I'm like we have a real problem here and we've got to come together and and I think that that you know there's a I was a good decision-m framework for me is um if I make a mistake where do I want to make the mistake on? Right? And so if I want to if I'm going to heir with my company, I'm going to heir in telling the truth and potentially scaring someone away. I'll take that because if that person doesn't want to face the truth, if he or she's not up for the fight, then they should go someplace else. They can have a good time. I'm sure they can have a good career, etc. So for me as a leader, I've always always believed in transparency partially because then I think you attract the right people.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯。部分原因是我会得到好的信息来采取行动。通常我看到的首席执行官的失败并不是因为他们做出了错误的决定。而是因为他们得到了错误的数据，导致了错误的决定。所以作为任何组织的领导者，建立能够迅速向你反映问题的渠道和文化是极其重要的。对我来说，你总是必须有自己的随机直接渠道。你知道，再次，如果你把组织看作有机体，它们有自己的激励机制。所以我的员工的激励机制是控制传递给我的信息，不是因为他们是坏人。这只是他们的工作，因为我可能会不堪重负。我该和谁见面？我的日程安排是什么？你知道，这个人值得见首席执行官吗？对我来说，我的斗争是我只是设置了一堆随机的渠道，我会定期与四级以下的工程师见面，因为通常他们有那种毫不在乎的个性。他们会告诉我任何事情，他们喜欢贬低首席执行官。这很棒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Mhm. and uh partially because then I'm gonna get the good information so to act on. Usually the failures I see with CEOs aren't because they made the wrong decisions. It's because they were getting the wrong data that led to the wrong decisions. So it's incredibly important as a leader of any organization for you to build the channels and build the kind of culture that surfaces problems to you quickly. And then for me too, you always have to have your random direct channels. You know, the the again, if you think about organizations as organisms, they have their own incentives. And so my staff's incentive is to control the the the information that gets to me, not because they're bad people. It's just their job because I can get overwhelmed. Who do I meet with? What's my schedule? You know, is this person worthy of meeting the CEO? And for me, my fight is I just set up a bunch of random [ __ ] I'll meet with, you know, engineers four levels down consistently because usually they've got the kind of personality where they don't give a [ __ ] They'll tell me anything and everything and they like putting the CEO down. That's great.

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: It's, you know, engineers often, you know, don't like authority and code is like the biggest authority buster. It's like the truth truth.

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 一般。我想公司已经成功了很长时间，嗯，在某种程度上一直在享受成功的余荫。所以我需要非常非常迅速地更换团队，让一些有冲劲的人进来。整个团队。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Medium. I think the company had been successful for a long time and uh had coasted on that success to some extent. So I needed to turn over the team turn over like the entire team very very quickly and get some hungry people in there. the entire team.

</details>

**主持人**: 几乎是整个团队。是的。是的。那段时间很艰难，但后来你有了那种有使命感的人，他们正在努力证明自己。嗯，这是每家公司都必须经历的更新的一部分，我们扭转了局面。那段时期很艰难，但我们真的扭转了局面，那时我才明白，嘿，我喜欢运营，这很棒。这是我工作中最好的部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Almost the entire team. Yeah. Yeah. It was uh it was rough going for a while, but then you have kind of missionoriented people who are trying to prove themselves. Um and it's part of the renewal that every company has to go through and we turned it around. It was it was tough going, but we really turned around and that was when I kind of I learned, hey, my my love is running [ __ ] It's great. It's the best part of my job.

</details>

**主持人**: 你是如何让那家公司努力工作的？因为现在有很多人正在听，他们所在的公司可能已经成功了，可能已经有二十年了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How did you get that company to work hard? Because there's so many people listening right now that are in a company that might have been successful, might be two decades in

</details>

**主持人**: 这就像高管管理中的终极问题。你如何扭转一家大公司，甚至是只有200人的公司的文化？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: and this is an ultimate question in like executive management. How do you turn around the culture of a big or even even 200 people?

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 这非常困难。有时捷径就是换人。很容易说，哦，你有这些价值观。所以，就是要找到你认为会与你的文化机制或你的工作方式或你的价值观相符的人，然后将这些价值观和机制作为榜样来体现，然后确保你的团队体现这些价值观，并将其灌输到整个组织中。所以努力工作的一部分就是，你知道，在周六给团队发邮件，如果周六没有收到回复，周日就给他们发一封带问号的邮件。怎么回事？你知道，我想在**Expedia**，事后看来，我们工作很努力，我们很拼，但没有我喜欢的那样拼，因为**Expedia**我们卖的是度假产品，对吧？我们卖的产品是关于放松的。所以我们确实谈到了工作与生活的平衡。事后看来，在**Uber**，我不会，你知道，你来到**Uber**，你就要拼命工作。我们会非常苛刻。如果你表现不佳，我们会让你知道，如果你不改正，我们会把你赶走。但虽然会非常艰难，你将拥有真正的自主权。我们是一家大公司，但个人可以发挥巨大的作用。这是一家正在改变世界的公司。你将学到很多东西。虽然你会努力工作，但你也会玩得很开心。但如果你想混日子，就不要来这里。我对此非常清楚。我本应该在**Expedia**更清楚一些，但我们当时卖的是度假产品，所以我不能那么清楚。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: It's very difficult. Um and sometimes the shortcut is just change of people like it's very easy to say oh you have values this and that. So it's it's finding the people who you believe will line up with your cultural mechanisms or how you work or your values and then embodying those values and those mechanisms as examples and then making sure that your team embodies those values and imbuss down the down the organization. So part of working hard is like, you know, sending emails to the team on a Saturday and if I don't get a response on Saturday, sending them an email on Sunday with a question mark. What's going on? You know, I think at **Expedia** in hindsight, we we worked intensely and and and we went hard, but but not as hard as I like because **Expedia** was we were selling vacations, right? It was it was the the product that we were selling was about turning yourself off. And so we did talk about work life balance. Uh and in hindsight at **Uber**, I don't, you know, you come to **Uber**, you're going to work your ass off. We're going to be really demanding. If you're not performing, we're going to let you know, and if you don't fix it, we're going to push you out. But while it will be incredibly hard, you will have real agency at the company. We're a big company, but individuals can make a big difference. And it's a company that's making a difference in the world. You're going to learn so much. And while you will have worked hard, you're going to have a great time. But this is don't come here if you want to coast. And I'm very clear about that. And I should have been more clear at **Expedia**, but we were selling vacations, so I couldn't be quite that clear.

</details>

**主持人**: 新年总是有一种奇怪的能量，因为人们开始谈论他们的目标、新的开始和新的习惯。但现实是，大多数人把去年的想法带到了新的一年。我也是如此。他们仍然没有做任何事情。我明白为什么。开始新事物，特别是如果它是一项业务或一个项目，是令人不知所措的。在你开始之前，你正在寻找完美的时机，并成为完美的自己。而真正最重要的是迈出第一步。如果你有一个想法已经有一段时间了，一个产品，一家商店，你一直在考虑的事情，我们的赞助商**Shopify**让你轻松开始，因为你可以在一个地方建立你的商店，在社交媒体上销售，收款，使用**AI**工具，并管理一切。所以，如果2026年是你最终支持自己的一年，请访问**shopify.co.uk/bartlet**并开始销售。你现在也可以注册每月1美元的试用。只需访问**shopify.co.uk/UK/bartlet**。我向你保证，你不需要把一切都弄清楚。你只需要开始。在你担任首席执行官的12年里，**Expedia**的股价上涨了550%。销售额从21亿美元增长到88亿美元，增长了400%。你曾是美国科技公司中薪酬最高的首席执行官，薪酬为9410万美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: New year always has a strange energy to it because people start talking about their goals, fresh starts, and new habits. But the reality is that most people carry the same ideas they had last year into the new year. I'm guilty of that, too. And they still don't end up doing anything with them. And I get why. Starting something new, especially if it's a business or a project, is overwhelming. Before you start, you're looking for the perfect moment and to be the perfect version of yourself. When really what matters most is taking that first step. If you've had an idea for a while, a product, a store, something you've been sitting on, our sponsor, **Shopify**, makes it easy to get started because you can build your store, sell on socials, take payments, use **AI** tools, and manage everything all in one place. So, if 2026 is the year you finally back yourself, go to **shopify.co.uk/bartlet** and start selling. And you can sign up for a $1 per month trial right now, too. Just go to **shopify.co.uk/ UK /bartlet**. I promise you, you don't need to have it all figured out. You just need to start. In your 12 years as CEO, **Expedia** stock rose 550%. And sales increased 400% from 2.1 billion to 8.8 billion. And you were the highest paid CEO of a US tech company with a pay of 94.1 million.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 我把这一切都抛在了脑后，去了**Uber**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: I left it all behind to go to **Uber**.

</details>

**主持人**: 你把这一切都抛在了脑后。有一大笔期权包我从未兑现，但一切都很好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You left it all behind. There was a big options packet that I never vested, but it's all good.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 那是一段很棒的经历。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: It was a great run.

</details>

### 努力工作是一种技能

**主持人**: 我对努力工作这一点非常着迷，因为我认为十年前说你刚才说的话是非常禁忌的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I'm so I'm so intrigued about this point of hard work because I think 10 years ago saying what you just said was very taboo.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Yes.

</details>

**主持人**: 感觉现在被更多地提及了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It feels to be more invoked.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 我们现在自由了。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: We're freed now. YES.

</details>

**主持人**: 你现在自由了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: YOU'RE FREED NOW.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 是的。是的，确实如此。我，我有时会遇到人们问你一个问题，你会给年轻人什么建议？对我来说，生活中最重要的技能就是努力工作的技能。这不是一种你可以简单决定去做的技能。我认为太多人，你知道，专注于是否应该成为一名计算机程序员、医生，或者现在任何人都可以编写代码，是否应该学习文科？只需学会努力工作。当你看到顶尖运动员时，当然，他们有天赋，你知道，他们的天赋水平是世界级的，但精英运动员与非精英运动员的不同之处，我说的是精英，是他们拼命工作。他们有纪律。他们有条理。他们永不懈怠。你知道，看看**C罗**，看看**迈克尔·乔丹**等等。这在生活的各个方面都是一样的。在商业中是如此。在个人生活中也是如此。所以对我来说，对于我的孩子们，我只想教他们如何努力工作。对我来说，从小到大，作为一名银行家，作为一名高管，我不会让任何人比我更努力。如果这是真的，那么他们可能更聪明，更有天赋等等。但我不会让任何人比我更努力。我认为这是一个巨大的优势。随着时间的推移，这种优势会复合增长，我希望他们，我们的公司，我希望**Uber**成为一家极其努力工作的公司。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: YES. YES, INDEED. It's it I've I've gotten um you know, sometimes people ask you the question, uh what advice would you give to young people? And to me, the most important skill in life is a skill of working hard. And it's not a skill you can't just like decide you're going to do it. And I think way too many many people, you know, focus on should be should should you be a computer programmer or a doctor or study the liberal arts now that anyone can vibe code? Just learn to work hard. And it is, you know, the the when you see the top athletes, of course, they're talented and, you know, their talent level is world levels, but the thing that changes that that's different about the elite athletes than the non- elite athletes, and I'm talking elite, is they work their asses off. They're disciplined. They're structured. They're relentless. You know, look at **Ronaldo**, look at **Michael Jordan**, etc. That's the same thing is true in all of life. It's true in business. It's true in personal life. And so for me with my kids, I just want to teach them how to work hard. And and for me, like growing up, I as a banker, as an executive, I'm not going to let anyone out me. And if that's true, then they may be smarter, more talented, etc. But I'm not going to let anyone outwork me. And I think that that's a huge advantage that you have. over a period of time that advantage compounds and I want them our company like I want **Uber** to be an incredibly hardworking company

</details>

**主持人**: 努力工作是有代价的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: comes at a cost though working hard

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 是的，它会带来权衡，我们相信灵活性，所以人们会混淆缺乏灵活性与努力工作。你可以努力工作，同时也可以拥有灵活性。所以如果你想和家人共进晚餐，我在城里的时候，我非常重视和家人共进晚餐，你知道，晚上6点到8点，我绝对会花时间陪伴家人，但在晚上9点半，我会在查邮件。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: yes it it comes at a trade-off and and we we believe in flexibility so people confuse kind of lack of flexibility to working hard you can work hard and at the same time you can have flexibility so if you want to have dinner with your family and I'm I'm religious about having dinners with my family when I'm in town you know 6:00 to 8 uh absolutely spend that I'm with my family, but at, you know, 9:30 p.m. I'm checking emails.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Mhm.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 对。当我早上5点半醒来时，我会在查邮件。所以，当然，会有权衡。你知道，生活就是关于权衡的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Right. When I wake up at 5:30 and a.m. I'm checking emails. So, of course, there are trade-offs. And, you know, life is about trade-offs.

</details>

**主持人**: 我从采访首席执行官中学到的最重要的事情之一，以及我们普遍经历的疫情和远程工作，然后又回到办公室的转变，实际上最重要的事情就是你刚才说的，那就是对人诚实，这样他们就可以在自己的生活中为自己做出决定。我认为，那种可能被描述为有毒的东西是，当你公开说一套，但当他们到来时，却是完全不同的情况。但你正在做的是诚实，因此你允许人们在自己的生活中为自己做出决定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I think one of the most important things I've learned from interviewing CEOs and generally we've gone through a transition of COVID and remote work and then come back into like everyone's in the office again is actually the most important thing is what you just said, which is being honest with people so that they can make decisions for themselves in their lives. I think the the thing that one might describe as toxic is when you say something publicly, but then when they arrive, it's a completely different deal. But what you're doing is you're being honest and you're therefore allowing people to make decisions for themselves in their own lives.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 我也允许他们对我诚实。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: And I'm allowing them to be honest back to me.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。你，这是一种公司文化，像我这样的人会被它吸引。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. And you're a that's a that's a company culture that someone like me would be attracted to.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 绝对是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Absolutely.

</details>

**主持人**: 但有很多人听了之后会觉得再糟糕不过了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: But there's lots of people listening that couldn't think of anything worse.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 那也没关系。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: And that's okay.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yes. Yeah.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 有很多公司他们可以找到，或者很多事业他们可以找到。没关系。你说要学会努力工作。学会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: There are plenty of companies that they could find or plenty of causes that they can find. It's fine. You said learn to work hard. Learn

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 这是一种技能。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: it's a it's a skill.

</details>

**主持人**: 真的吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Really?

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 是的。当然是，因为你必须专注于某件事，不因失败而气馁，一遍又一遍地尝试，并且比别人更努力地工作。这不是你可以随意开启或关闭的东西。我总是在人们身上看到这一点。就是那种坚定的决心。就像我们在**Uber**，实际上有一句话，它写在我们的价值观之一中：“拥抱磨砺”（Embrace the grind），你知道，拥抱它。那是一种习得的技能。那不是你与生俱来的东西。也许，也许有一部分是你与生俱来的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Yes. Of course it is because you you've got to the idea of just staying focused on something, not being discouraged by failing, trying over and over again and just working harder than others. It's not something you can turn on and off. I see it in people all the time. There's just like this grim determination. like we uh at **Uber** that there's actually saying it's it's it's inside one of our values. Embrace the grind, you know, embrace it. That's that's a learned skill. That's not something you're born with. Maybe maybe there's an element that you're born with.

</details>

**主持人**: 你见过不努力工作的人变得非常努力，异常努力吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Have you ever seen someone who isn't a hard worker become a really hard worker, an exceptionally hard worker?

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 啊，这是一个好问题。不，我没有想到这样的人。你呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Ah, that's a good question. No, no one doesn't occur to me. Have you?

</details>

**主持人**: 不。我听说，我想可能是**Airbnb**的**布莱恩·切斯基**或**埃隆**说过，他从未见过不努力工作的人变得非常努力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: No. I I heard I think it might have been maybe **Brian Chesky Airbnb** or **Elon** say that he's never seen someone who wasn't a hard worker become a really hard worker.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 这很有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: That's interesting.

</details>

**主持人**: 这就是为什么……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And this is why

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 我正在努力想出一个人，但目前为止失败了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: I'm trying to come up with someone failing so far.

</details>

**主持人**: 也许我可以说，这在某种程度上与你面前的这些照片、你的童年、你没有选择的早期背景有关。我也在这里努力工作。但是，是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And maybe I might posit that it's somewhat to do with you know these photos that you have in front of you, your childhood, your early context which you didn't choose. I also working hard here. But yeah,

</details>

**主持人**: 但你被塑造成了一种无情的方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: but that you were forged in such a way that you were going to be

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 无情。我指的是永不懈怠。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: ruthless. So relentless is the word I meant.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。我的意思是，对自己无情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. I I mean ruthless to myself.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Mhm.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 永不懈怠。永不懈怠是对的。你知道，我想**杰夫·贝索斯**曾一度想把**亚马逊**命名为“永不懈怠”。他当时在考虑把这作为公司的名字，对吧？它就是，当我看到成功的科技公司，特别是科技公司时，它们身上有一种永不懈怠的特质。就像在**Uber**，我们有很多不同的团队在尝试做不同的事情，但每个团队都致力于优化和改进自己的特定功能。公司没有一个部分不是每天都在改进的。如果他们改进得不够快，就会有其他人取代他们的位置并改进它。所以作为一个有机体，公司的每个部分，无论是支付团队在新的支付类型或支付成功方面，还是欺诈团队，还是移动应用团队在转化率等方面。每个团队都致力于改进他们所做的一切。所以整个公司都在以小的方式不断改进，永不停歇。正是这种永不懈怠的商业本质，而且仅仅变得更好是不够的。我们必须比竞争对手更快地变得更好，因为我们的竞争对手也在变得更好。所以这基本上是谁能更快地适应今天的市场现实，或者你所看到的明天的市场预测。变化的速度和机会的识别。我认为这是最重要的两个因素。嗯，变化的速度，你知道，如果你能快速工作，你就是在加速时间。你知道，你每尝试一次，我就可以尝试两次。我比你有更多的时间。然后，当然，还有识别机会，追逐机会。这是你真正需要做对的两件事。如果你尝试两次，你不仅会得到两个数据点的信息，而且你成功尝试的概率也会增加100%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Relentless. Relentless is right. You know, I think I think at one point **Jeff Bezos** was going to call **Amazon** relentless. That was uh he was thinking about that being the name of the company, right? It's it's just and and that is when I see successful technology companies and especially technology companies there is this relentlessness about them like at **Uber** we have lots of different groups that are trying to do different things but each and every team is built and targeted on optimizing and improving their own particular function. There isn't a piece of the company that is not improving every single day. And if they're not improving fast enough, someone else is going to take their place and going to improve it. So as a as an organism, every part of the company, whether it's a payments team in terms of new payments types or uh payment success or the fraud team or the mobile app team in terms of conversions, etc. Every team is set up in and organized for and gold on improving everything that they do. So the whole company in small ways is constantly improving never ever stopping and it is that relentless nature of business and and the minute and it's not good enough to get better. We have to get better faster than our competitors because our competitors are all getting better as well. So it's it's basically like who can adapt faster to either the reality of the market as it is today or the prediction of the market as you see it tomorrow. And it's the speed of change and it's identification of the opportunity. Those are the two factors I think that are most important. Um, and the speed of change, you know, if you can work fast, you're kind of accelerating time. You know, every one shot that you take, I can take two shots. I've got more time than you do. And then, of course, there's identifying the opportunity, going after it. Those are the two things you really have to get right. If you're taking two shots, not only you going to get two data points of information, but you're also increasing your probability of having a successful shot by like 100%.

</details>

**主持人**: 射门。只是射门。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Shots on goal. Just shots on goal.

</details>

### 持续改进与风险承担

**主持人**: 你如何创造持续改进的文化？因为成功的公司，就像你之前强调的，它们会因为胜利而自满，它们喜欢休息一下庆祝一下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How do you create a culture of continuous improvement? Because successful companies, as you kind of highlighted earlier, they become complacent with their victories and they like to take some time off and celebrate and

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 你知道，我们击掌庆祝，然后放松一下，然后实际上研究表明，他们做了一项大型元分析，他们研究了成功的公司，结果表明它们变得风险规避。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: you know, we high five and then and then we chill and then actually the studies show they did this big meta analysis where they looked at successful companies and they showed that they become risk adverse.

</details>

**主持人**: 完全正确。因为他们失去了一个版本。他们现在有东西可以失去。所以只是保护。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Totally. because they lost a version. They have something to lose now. So just protect.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 我想在某种程度上，**Uber**的好消息是，我们一直是一家有危机感的公司。你知道，公司在成立之初就有危机感，不得不与出租车工会抗争才能生存。然后**特拉维斯**离开，新任首席执行官上任，那是一段非常非常艰难的时期。然后我们经历了疫情，这对公司来说又是一场灾难，但最终让我们做好了准备，做得更好。然后人们说，你知道，那是一次艰难的IPO。**Uber**永远不会盈利，而今天我们取得了巨大的成功，但我们面临着**AI**和自动驾驶的挑战和机遇。所以我们一直是一家，我想说，被低估的公司，这融入了我们的文化，我们是一家有冲劲的公司。我确实认为我们有时会在一些小方面变得自满，我有一个领导团队，当他们看到自满时，他们往往会识别出来并将其彻底清除。这是一个不满足、总是积极进取的团队，我喜欢我们这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: I think the good news to some extent with **Uber** is that we've always been a company that has had a chip on its shoulder. You know, the company had a chip on it shoulder when it was founded and had to like fight taxi unions for its very existence. Uh and then the disaster happened with **Travis** leaving and then a new CEO coming in at the time. That was a really really difficult time. Then we went through a period of COVID which was again a disaster for the company but ultimately prepared us to to do better. Then people saying you know it was a tough IPO. Uh **Uber** is never going to get profitable and today we're incredibly successful but we've got the challenge and the opportunity of **AI** and autonomous. So we've always been a company that has been I would say underestimated and that feeds into our culture that this is a we are a hungry company and I do think we're sometimes guilty of getting complacent in little ways and I have a leadership team that when they see complacency more often than not than not they identify it and they get it the hell out. It's it's a team that is not satisfied, that's always driving and I love that about us.

</details>

**主持人**: 如何平衡享受成功和成就？我的意思是，你已经扭转了这家公司，使其成为一家高盈利的公司。我与许多共同的朋友交谈过，他们都深情地谈论了你对业务的影响。我的意思是，数字不言自明。当你加入**Uber**时，**Uber**每年亏损25亿到30亿美元。现在，它每年产生85亿美元的自由现金流。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How does one balance enjoying the success and the accomplishments? I mean, you've turned this company around, highly profitable company. Everyone that I've spoken to, many of our mutual friends have talked lovingly about the impact you've had on the business. I mean, the numbers speak for themselves. When you joined **Uber**, **Uber** was losing 2.5 to 3 billion per year. Now, it generates 8.5 billion in free cash flow every year.

</details>

**主持人**: 你如何让人们……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How do you get people to

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 去年是98亿，但是……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 9.8 in the last year, but

</details>

**主持人**: 你算的是98亿。好的。太棒了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: you you're counting 9.8. Okay. Incredible.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 庆祝。放松。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Celebrate. Chill.

</details>

**主持人**: 当然。嗯，你可以庆祝，但不要放松。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Sure. Well, you you can you can celebrate or not chill.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Okay. How

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 你可以，我们确实会抓住那些时刻。我们确实，经营一家公司很酷。这很重要。经营一家不断创造新纪录的公司很酷。我们确实会庆祝这些纪录，我们确实会庆祝这些团队。也许还不够。再次，这又回到了你宁愿犯什么错误？我宁愿犯庆祝得太少，对生活有点不满，然后继续努力的错误。但是，嗯，我们会抓住我们的时刻，但成功本身，我不知道，成功本身几乎就是一种庆祝。当你在一个竞争如此激烈的领域取得成功时，我只是从中找到了深深的满足感。嗯，我想我的团队也是如此。你如何让团队承担他们需要承担的风险？你是否会激励他们承担多少风险？你是怎么做到的？第一，他们总是快速行动。这就是我们所做的。我们不断推动公司的执行速度。所以我想这有帮助。但我确实认为我们现在谈论的一种机制，我曾与团队谈论过承担“智能风险”。我认为你绝对正确，那就是随着公司变得越来越大，越来越成功，它们往往会变得更加风险规避。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: you can do we we take those moments. We do c it's cool to run a company. That's so important. It's cool to run a company that's hitting record after record after record. And we do celebrate those records and we do celebrate those teams. Maybe not enough. And again, it goes to like what what what mistake would you rather make? I'd I'd rather make the mistake of celebrating a little bit too little and kind of being a little pissed off about life in general and pushing. But um we we take our moments, but the the the success itself, I don't know, succeeding is almost a celebration in and of itself. And and when you're succeeding in such a competitive field, I just find a deep sense of satisfaction there. Uh and I think my team does, too. How do you get the team to take take those risks that they need to take? Is there something you do you like incentivize them on the amount of shots they take? How do you do that? One is they're always moving fast. That's what we do. We push we're constantly pushing the pace of the company in terms of execution. So I think that helps. But but I do think that there's there's a mechanism that we talk now about that I've talked to a team about taking smart risks. I think you're absolutely right which is as companies get bigger and more successful they tend to become more riskaverse

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 而这应该恰恰相反，因为你可以承担更多的风险，你可以犯更多的错误，因为你有98亿美元的现金流来保护自己免受一些错误的影响。所以我在过去，我想说两年里，我积极推动团队在风险方面突破界限。不要防守，要进攻等等。这来自于我挑战团队，我谈论它，树立有时失败的榜样，然后说没关系，继续前进。然后有时我做出被认为风险更大的决定。这种树立榜样的行为，然后允许公司效仿。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: and it should be the exact opposite because you can take more risks you can make more mistakes because you've got kind of this 9.8 8 billion of cash flow to protect yourself against some of those mistakes. So I have definitely in the past I would say two years pushed the team actively to push the envelope in terms of risk. Don't be defensive, be offensive, etc. And it comes from my challenging the teams, my talking about it, setting examples of sometimes failing and then saying it's okay, moving on. Uh and then sometimes my taking decisions that are seen as more risky than not. that setting the example then allows the company to follow.

**主持人**: 那么，如果我在你的团队中，你如何为我设定目标？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So if I was in one of your teams, what how do you think about goal setting for me?

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 嗯，所有团队都有不同的目标，业务目标。广告团队必须每年推动技术驱动的增量广告收入，以及/或客户满意度、客户净推荐值等等。所以每个团队都有自己的目标，他们围绕这些目标进行组织，执行这些目标，并严格跟踪。这是我们拥有的最好的机制。我只希望有一个更好的机制，因为目标设定的艺术成为问题，那就是你是否设定了正确的目标？它们是否过于雄心勃勃？它们是否不够雄心勃勃？有时人们可以玩弄系统。所以我们使用它，但我不能告诉你它是完美的。你之前谈到价值观。很多公司都会去进行一次场外活动，他们在白墙上写下一些词，他们说雄心、热情、勇气等等。你如何看待这种企业习惯，即设定价值观和诸如此类的事情？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Um all the teams have different goals, business goals. The ads team has to drive at technologydriven incremental ad uh dollars per year andor customer satisfaction uh customer NPS etc. So every team has its own goals uh and they organize against those goals and they execute those goals and they're religiously tracked. It's the best mechanism that we have. I just wish that there was a better one because the art of the goal setting becomes the issue which is are you setting the right goals? Are they too ambitious? Are they not ambitious enough? And sometimes people can game the system. So we use it but I can't tell you that it's perfect. What about you talked earlier about values. A lot of companies go and do an offsite and they write some words on a words on a white on a wall and they say ambition, enthusiasm, courage, whatever. What do you think of that sort of corporate habit of go values and stuff?

### 公司价值观与文化重塑

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 我们进行了这项工作，第一次失败了，第二次成功了。我们，当它第一次来到**Uber**时，显然有一种观点认为我们需要对公司进行文化重塑，所以对我来说，去检查公司的文化并改变它非常重要。那是一个声明，我认为这种文化有一些很酷的东西，一些很酷的想法。例如，有一个价值观是“踩脚趾”（toe stepping），“踩脚趾”的想法就是你我之前谈到的，我们希望在组织内部互相挑战。所以如果我必须踩你的脚趾，告诉你一些你不想听的话，我是被允许的，即使这会伤害你，因为真相更重要。所以有时真相会伤人，那也没关系。这就是“踩脚趾”的想法。而发生的情况是，有时这些价值观被武器化了，原本旨在说出真相的“踩脚趾”精神，变成了成为一个混蛋的借口。对吧？所以价值观本身可以是伟大的，也可以是糟糕的，这取决于你如何执行这些价值观。当我第一次进来时，我们不得不重新制定价值观。我当时，**杰夫·贝索斯**有一句我喜欢的话，那就是公司的价值观几乎是它们自己形成的。如果你说“你应该”，你就会失败，因为公司会“应该”，对吧？我们最初采取的方法是，我们实际上会得到价值观体系。我们让公司所有员工投票。你认为哪些价值观应该成为新**Uber**的一部分等等。我们收集了所有信息，然后我们编辑并提出了一份新的价值观清单。其中有一个价值观是我自己写的。那是我的，那就是“做正确的事”。句号。它不是众包的。就是这样。通常对于这些价值观，你会觉得有一整套解释，人们会说：“那么‘做正确的事’到底是什么意思？”你必须自己弄清楚。对我来说，这向整个公司传达了一个信息，那就是如果你在**Uber**工作，你就有责任，我不会告诉你具体该怎么做。所以，运用你的判断力。我们期望你运用你的判断力去做正确的事。有时做正确的事并不清楚。我应该追求我的业务目标吗？我应该在业务目标上妥协吗？因为安全受到质疑。当然，你应该。安全优先于业务等等。但我们把这种分量和责任放在了员工身上。但其余的众包价值观体系，它是可以被遗忘的，因为它就是那种激情、雄心、团队合作之类的东西，哪家公司不相信团队合作呢？饶了我吧。所以我们，**尼基·克里希纳·墨菲**，她负责管理人员，她推动我在四五年后重新设定价值观。那时我觉得我确实有权发表意见，我已经在那里了，我们还没有完全完成转型等等，但我已经是公司的一部分了，然后我们提出了一套不同的价值观。你知道，我们的一个价值观，顺便说一句，“去争取”（go get it）是唯一幸存下来的。不，不，抱歉。“做正确的事”是唯一幸存下来的。但例如，“去争取”是我们最重要的价值观之一。而“去争取”的想法显然就是我们所做的。我们去，我们帮助人们去或争取，对吧？崛起和吃。所以就我们所做的而言，这很有趣，但它是一种态度，那就是我们作为一家公司，我们是积极进取的人。我们会积极进取。我们会努力。我们会快速行动。我们为了胜利而战。所以我们拥有的价值观，“去争取”或者我非常喜欢的一个，“伟大的思想不必相同”（great minds don't think alike）。我们提出了一套价值观，我认为这很不寻常，它描述了我们作为一家公司的不同之处，它真正符合我们的本质。

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: We went through the exercise, failed the first time, succeeded the second time. We and and when it and we failed when it first came to **Uber**, obviously there was a view that there we needed a cultural reset of the company and so it was very important for me to go and inspect the culture of the company and change it. It was a statement and the culture had I think some cool stuff in there, some cool ideas in there. Like for example, there was one value that was um to stepping and the idea of toe stepping is is what you and I talked about earlier, which is we want to challenge each other within the organization. And so if I have to step on your toes and tell you something that you don't want to hear, I'm allowed to even though it hurts you uh because the truth is more important. So sometimes the truth hurts and that's okay. That was the idea of toestepping. And what happened was sometimes those values became weaponized where to stepping whose spirit came from a place of we want to speak the truth became an excuse to be a jerk. Right? So the values in and of themselves can be great or terrible based on how you execute on on those values. When I first came in, we had to redo the values. And I was there there's a saying by um **Jeff Bezos** that that I love, which is like the the values of the company almost they they they appear the value system of the company appears to some extent. You don't if you say thou shalt, you're going to fail because the company shall, right? And the approach that we first took was that we will actually get the value system. We had we had a vote for all the employees in the company. What values do you think should be part of the new **Uber**, etc. We took all the signal and then we edited it and came up with a new list of of values. And there was one value that I wrote myself. It was mine and it was do the right thing. Period. It wasn't crowdsourced. It was just that. And and usually with these values, you're like there's a whole explanation and people are like, "Well, what does do the right thing period mean?" like you have to figure it out. And for me, it it was a message to the whole company, which was if you work at **Uber**, you have a responsibility and I'm not going to tell you exactly what to do. So, use your judgment. And it's our expectation that you use your judgment to do the right thing. And sometimes doing the right thing, it's not clear. Should I go after my business goal? Should I compromise on a business goal? Because safety is in question. Of course, you should. Safety comes first before business, etc. But we were putting that weight and that responsibility in uh within the employees. But the rest of the value system that was kind of crowdsourced, it was forgettable because it was the kind of stuff that you passion, ambition, teamwork, like what company doesn't believe in teamwork? Give me a break. So we uh **Nikki** uh **Krishna Murphy** who runs uh people she pushed me to reset the values four or five years in by then I felt like I did have a right to have a point of view I'd been there we weren't quite done with the turnaround etc but I was a part of the company and then we came up with a value set which is different you know there's uh our one of our values by the way go get it was the only one that survived No, no, sorry. Uh, do the right thing was the only one that survived. But for example, go get it is one of our top values. And the idea of go get it is obviously it's literally what we do. We go we help people go or get it, right? Rise and eats. So it's kind of fun in terms of what we do, but it's an attitude which is we as a company, we're go-getters. We're going to be aggressive. We're going to push. We're going to move fast. We play to win. And so the value sets that we have, go get it or one that I really like, great minds don't think alike. We came up with a with a set of values which I think is unusual and describes how we are different as a company and it's really true to who we are.

### AI时代的失败与实验

**主持人**: 失败和实验这种态度有多重要，尤其是在我们所处的这个快速变化的时代？当你听像**雷·库兹韦尔**这样的人预测未来时，他说如果你现在10岁，到60岁时，你会经历一年的变化，我想是11天，这种指数级的加速。

**主持人**: How important is um this sort of this attitude of failure and experimentation especially in a world that's transitioning as fast as the one we're in. When you listen to people like **Ray Kurswell** his predictions of the future he says that if you're 10 now by the age of 60 you'll experience a year's change in I think it's 11 days and just this sort of this sort of exponential acceleration

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 加速回报定律。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. Like how do you how do you you know how do you create a culture or build a team in a world where the correct answer is changing this quickly?

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 我认为，嗯，这在于建立一种拥抱变化并不断挑战自我的文化。我将把功劳归于**特拉维斯**和创始团队。你知道，有一种观点认为他们所做的一切都很糟糕，但这根本不是真的。我们在公司有一个非常高的人才标准。我们一直保持着高人才标准，我们没有妥协。我发现，有才华且有动力的人总是在不断地寻找真相。所以文化是不够的。你实际上需要公司里有合适的人。我认为我们有一家有危机感的公司，它诞生于一个新行业的创建。所以我们经历过这些。嗯，我们有一群有动力、有冲劲的人，他们不断寻求改变，你有一个领导者和一个领导团队，他们正在推动公司这样做，并且不会因为员工挑战他们而惩罚他们。我认为这就像你必须组合在一起的炖菜，但它是文化和人的结合。你有没有公司做出过大多数人不会做或认为错误或不会冒险的伟大赌注的案例研究，这些赌注最终对你的成功至关重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: I I think that it is um setting a culture that does embrace that change and is constantly challenging itself. And I will give uh **Travis** and the founding team credit. You know that there's kind of this idea of everything that they did was terrible and that's just not true. We have a very high talent bar at the company. We have always kept a high talent bar at the company and we haven't compromised. And what I found is that talented people who are also driven are on a constant hunt for the truth. So culture isn't enough. You actually need the right people at the company. And I think we've got a company that does have a chip on a shoulder was born out of the creation of a new industry. So we've experienced it. Um, and we have a group of people who are driven and hungry and are constantly looking for change and you got a leader and a leadership team that's pushing the company to do so and doesn't penalize folks for challenging them. I think it's kind of this stew that you have to put together, but it's a combination of culture and people. Do you have any mental case studies of great bets the company has taken that most people wouldn't have taken or thought was wrong or wouldn't have taken the risk on that trans transpired to be critical to your success?

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 嗯，你知道，我不知道，嗯，我想这对成功至关重要，但有一个有趣的故事是，出租车是**Uber**业务增长最快的部分之一。所以你记得**Uber**，我们最初是出租车的敌人，然后建立了这种点对点的拼车服务。大约五六年前，我们现在产品负责人**萨钦**，他致力于开发一种技术，让出租车公司拥有自己的**Uber**小应用。最终他来到了**Uber**，感谢上帝，他说，我们为什么不把这个内置到**Uber**里呢？我们为什么不真的在**Uber**上建立出租车服务呢？最初在公司内部，我一直与一些创始人保持联系，只是因为我想要他们的建议，为什么不呢？你知道，他们建立了一家伟大的公司。我站在巨人的肩膀上。他们说这是地球上最愚蠢的事情，你无法连接出租车。他们恨我们。他们设定的费率会很糟糕。有很多技术原因。他们之前尝试过，完全失败了。但我想**萨钦**，嗯，他在这个行业工作过，然后我有点无知地说，为什么不试试呢？这种结合让我们能够开发出租车产品，出租车是公司增长最快的部分，它完全违背了公司的创立初衷。但现在我们，你知道，我希望世界上每一辆出租车都能连接到**Uber**。为什么不呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Well, you know, I don't know about um well, I think it will be critical to to the success, but there's a funny one which is taxis are one of the fastest growing parts of **Uber**'s business. So you remember **Uber**, we started as the enemy of taxis and built out this peer-to-peer ride sharing. And it's probably five or six years ago, our head of product now, **Sachin**, he worked on building kind of um a technology that would allow taxi companies to to have their own little **Uber** app. And eventually he came to **Uber**, thank God, and he's like, well, why don't we build that in **Uber**? Why don't we actually build taxis on **Uber**? And originally within the company and and I I kept in touch with some of the founders just cuz I want their advice cuz why not? You know, they they they built a great company. I'm standing on the shoulders of giants. Uh they said it's the most idiotic thing on earth that you can't wire up taxis. They hate us. They set rates will be terrible. Lots of technical reasons. They had tried it earlier. It was a total failure. But I think **Sachin** uh having worked in the industry and then my being kind of ignorant saying why the hell not try it that combination allowed us to build out a taxi product and taxi is the fastest growing segment of the company and it went completely against the founding of the company. But now we're you know I I hope to have every single taxi in the world wired up to **Uber**. Why not?

**主持人**: 在我作为创始人的头十年里，我根本没有优先考虑睡个好觉。但随着时间的推移，我开始意识到这是影响我生活中一切的关键指标。我的情绪、我的专注力、我的表现能力以及清晰思考和良好领导的能力。所以现在我的生活方式相当疯狂，跨时区旅行，工作到很晚，训练到很晚，我仍然努力保护我的睡眠，这有时意味着晚一点开始新的一天。是我的**Whoop**帮助我建立了这种联系。他们是这个节目的赞助商之一，在过去的四年里，我的**Whoop**每天都给我提供关于我的睡眠、我的恢复、我承受的压力以及更广泛地，我的日常行为如何影响我的整体健康状况的见解。这是猜测和了解我为什么会有这种感觉之间的区别。有时它会提醒我。有时它会让我放慢速度。有时它会推动我更加努力，但它始终为我提供数据，让我对自己有更深入的了解。没有它，我很难优化我的生活和表现。现在，你可以通过我的链接**join.woop.com/ceo**免费获得一个月。免费一个月。**join.woop.com/co**。我刚刚投资的这家公司正在疯狂增长。我想成为告诉你这件事的人，因为我认为它会为你创造巨大的生产力优势。**Whisper Flow**是一款你可以安装在电脑和手机上所有设备上的应用程序，它允许你与你的技术对话。所以，我不用写邮件，我只需点击手机上的一个按钮，就可以口述邮件，它会使用**AI**来整理我所说的话。然后当我完成后，我只需点击这里的一个按钮，整封邮件就为我写好了。它每天为我节省了大量时间，因为**Whisper**会学习我的写作方式。所以在**WhatsApp**上，它知道我更随意一些。在邮件中，它更专业一些。而且，他们刚刚做了一件非常有趣的事情。我可以创建一些短语来自动为我完成工作。我只需说“**Jack**的**LinkedIn**”，它就会为我复制**Jack**的**LinkedIn**个人资料，因为它知道**Jack**在我的生活中是谁。这为我节省了大量时间。公司正在疯狂增长，这就是我投资这家企业的原因，也是他们现在成为这个节目赞助商的原因，**Whisper Flow**坦率地说，正在成为商业生产力与创业领域最公开的秘密。现在就去**whisperflow**（拼写为w i s p r f l l o w.ai/steven）看看吧。它会为你带来颠覆性的改变。这是我为你制作的东西。我意识到**direio**的受众都是奋斗者，无论是在商业还是健康方面。我们都有宏伟的目标想要实现。我学到的一件事是，当你瞄准一个非常非常宏伟的目标时，它会让你感到心理上非常不舒服，因为它有点像站在珠穆朗玛峰脚下仰望。实现目标的途径是将其分解成微小的步骤。我们团队称之为“1%”。实际上，这种理念对我们在这里的许多成功负有重要责任。所以，我们所做的，以便你在家也能实现任何宏伟目标，就是制作了这些“1%日记”，我们去年发布了这些日记，全部售罄。所以我一遍又一遍地要求我的团队把日记带回来，同时引入一些新的颜色，并对日记进行一些小的调整。所以，现在我们为你提供了更好的选择。所以，如果你心中有一个宏伟的目标，并且你需要一个框架、一个流程和一些动力，那么我强烈建议你在它们再次售罄之前购买一本这样的日记。你现在可以在**thediary.com**购买，在那里你可以享受我们黑色星期五捆绑包20%的折扣。如果你想要链接，链接就在下面的描述中。还有另一个，嗯，我们中间来了一个“外星人”，嗯，那就是**AI**。你，你知道，据我所知，**Uber**一直以来在某种程度上都是由**AI**驱动的，但嗯，世界在过去几年里发生了变化，就**AI**而言。在技术投资和改进方面有了巨大的加速。你除了**Uber**之外还做了什么？

**主持人**: For the first 10 years that I was a founder I didn't prioritize getting a good night's sleep at all. But over time, I started to realize that it was the key metric that influenced everything in my life. My mood, my focus, my ability to show up and to think clearly and to lead well. So now with my lifestyle being pretty crazy, traveling across time zones, working late, training late, I still fight to protect my sleep, which sometimes means starting the day a little bit later. It was my **Whoop** that helped me to make this connection. They are one of my sponsors for the show, and for the last four years, every day, my **Whoop** has given me insights into my sleep, my recovery, the strain I'm taking on, and more broadly, how my daily behaviors influence my overall holistic health. It's the difference between guessing and knowing why I might be feeling the way that I feel. Sometimes it will nudge me. Sometimes it will get me to slow down. Sometimes it pushes me to go even harder, but all the time it provides me with data that gives me a deeper understanding of myself. And without it, it'd be hard to optimize how I live and perform. Right now, you can get one month free through my link at **join.woop.com/ceo**. One month free. **Join.woop.com/co**. This company that I've just invested in is growing like crazy. I want to be the one to tell you about it because I think it's going to create such a huge productivity advantage for you. **Whisper Flow** is an app that you can get on your computer and on your phone on all your devices and it allows you to speak to your technology. So instead of me writing out an email, I click one button on my phone and I can just speak the email into existence and it uses **AI** to clean up what I was saying. And then when I'm done, I just hit this one button here and the whole email is written for me. And it's saving me so much time in a day because **Whisper** learns how I write. So on **WhatsApp**, it knows how I am, a little bit more casual. On email, a little bit more professional. And also, there's this really interesting thing they've just done. I can create little phrases to automatically do the work for me. I can just say **Jack**'s **LinkedIn** and it copies **Jack**'s **LinkedIn** profile for me because it knows who **Jack** is in my life. This is saving me a huge amount of time. company is growing like absolute crazy and this is why I invested in the business and why they're now a sponsor of this show and **Whisper Flow** is frankly becoming the worstkept secret in business productivity and entrepreneurship. Check it out now at **whisperflow** spelled w i s p r f l l o w.ai/steven. It will be a game changer for you. This is something that I've made for you. I realize that the direio audience are strivvers whether it's in business or health. We all have big goals that we want to accomplish. And one of the things I've learned is that when you aim at the big big big goal, it can feel incredibly psychologically uncomfortable because it's kind of like being stood at the foot of Mount Everest and looking upwards. The way to accomplish your goals is by breaking them down into tiny small steps. And we call this in our team the 1%. And actually this philosophy is highly responsible for much of our success here. So, what we've done so that you at home can accomplish any big goal that you have is we've made these 1% diaries and we released these last year and they all sold out. So, I asked my team over and over again to bring the diaries back, but also to introduce some new colors and to make some minor tweaks to the diary. So, now we have a better range for you. So, if you have a big goal in mind and you need a framework and a process and some motivation, then I highly recommend you get one of these diaries before they all sell out once again. And you can get yours now at **the diary.com** where you can get 20% off our Black Friday bundle. And if you want the link, the link is in the description below. And there's another um there's an alien that's arrived amongst us um which is **AI**. And you've you know **Uber**'s always been somewhat powered from what I understand by very much so degree but um the world has changed in the last couple years as it relates to **AI**.

### AI的颠覆性影响与社会适应

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 我不偏执。我不，我想说我不是那样的人，但也许我是。我想我的本能总是向前看。**Uber**就是建立在**AI**核心之上的。我们所有的定价，我们所有的路线规划，你与谁匹配，快递员是否批量处理订单，也就是他们是接两个订单还是一个订单。我们所有的系统，底层系统都是由**AI**驱动的。我们每天完成4000万次行程。你知道，那种调度无法通过启发式规则完成，我们必须在纽约街头和拉各斯街头工作。所以我们已经将整个公司建立在经过本地问题训练的小型**AI**模型之上，然后将它们拼接在一起。这正是公司的本质。所以对我们来说，**AI**是一种核心技能，**AI**可能会搞砸事情，对吧？它不是基于启发式的。**AI**在96%的时间里工作正常，但在4%的时间里会出错，这会产生一些突发问题。所以作为一家公司，我们对**AI**的不确定性层感到适应。所以我想说我们正在大步迈向**AI**。我们不是那些研究机构，但我想说在应用**AI**方面，团队正在努力在公司内部构建更新的**AI**体验。但是，你知道，作为一个人，退一步看，它对社会的影响将是巨大的。回到**库兹韦尔**的加速回报定律，以前社会总是能够适应这些变化。嗯，它之所以能够适应，是因为它有时间去适应。而**AI**字面上，非常字面上地思考，**AI**将能够在未来10年内取代70-80%的人类工作。10年对于社会适应这种影响来说，时间并不长。现在它们会比人类更贵还是更便宜等等？谁知道呢？但这种能力将在未来10年内出现，对于智力工作，大概15年内对于体力工作，15到20年内对于体力工作，因为实体**AI**……

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: I'm not paranoid. I'm not I guess I was going to say I'm not built that way, but maybe I am. I I think my instinct is always just to go just to move forward. And **Uber** has been built out of an **AI** core. all of our pricing, all of our routing, who you're matched with, uh whether or not a courier batches a trip, which is do they take two orders or one order. All of our systems, underlying systems are are driven by **AI**. We do 40 million trips a day. You know, that kind of orchestration can't be done by uh heristic rules and we've got to work on the streets of New York and the streets of Logos as well. So the the we we have built the entire company on small **AI** models that have been trained on local problems and then get stitched together. That's literally what the company is. So for us **AI** is it's kind of a core skill set and and **AI** can it can mess things up, right? It it's not because it's not heruristics based. There are emergent issues that come out of an **AI** that works 96% of the time and 4% of the time it screws up. So we're comfortable with the uncertainty layer of **AI** as a company. So we are I would say moving headlong into **AI**. We're not one of the, you know, research shops, but I would say in terms of applied **AI**, the team is driving to build **AI** kind of newer **AI** experiences across the company. But, you know, stepping back as a as a person, the impact on society is going to be enormous. And going back to **Kurszswwell**'s kind of law of accelerating returns, whereas previously society has always been able to adjust to these kinds of shifts. Um, it's been able to adjust because it had time to adjust. And **AI** literally quite literally thinks and **AI** will be able to replace the work that 70 80% of humans can do over the next 10 years. 10 years is not a lot of time for society to adjust to that kind of an impact. Now are they going to be more expensive than humans, cheaper than humans, etc. Who knows? But the capability will be there probably in the next 10 years for intellectual jobs probably call it 15 years for physical 15 20 years for physical jobs because physical **AI**

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 我真的无法从我采访过的**AI**专家那里得到答案，那就是那70%或80%的人该做什么？因为我们自己的业务中，有很多我们以前会招聘的工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: I've I've not been able to get an answer on that really, I think, from the experts in **AI** that I've interviewed, which is like what do those 70 or 80 people% of people do? Because we're seeing in our own business that there's many jobs which we would have hired for previously.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 嗯，在各个方面，**AI**现在都做得异常出色。而且每天，真的是每天，我们都在尝试看看新的模型，**Gemini Pro 3**或其他什么，能否做我们目前手动完成的事情。而且每天我们都会取得那些小突破，然后说：“哦，好的。现在我们不再需要了。”编码是你经常谈论的那些大领域之一，**Uber**已经发生了某种巨大的颠覆，积极的颠覆，你的很多程序员现在都在使用**AI**来……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Um across the board that **AI** is now doing exceptionally well. And every single day, literally daily, we try to see if the new model, **Gemini Pro 3** or whatever, can do things that we're currently doing manually. And every day we're getting those little breakthroughs and going, "Oh, okay. Now we no longer need to." And coding is one of those big areas you talk about a lot where there's been already sort of big dis disruption positive disruption at **Uber** and a lot of your coders are now using **AI** to

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 是的，我们大约90%的程序员现在都在使用**AI**，这说起来容易，但其中大约30%是高级用户，他们表现出明显的差异，例如在差异数量方面，差异是指与上次代码发布不同的代码发布。所以衡量生产力的方法之一就是你向代码库提交了多少差异。**Uber**就是一个巨大的代码库。这就是我们。所以我们的工程师实际上是公司的建造者。他们正在制造进入系统的砖块。嗯，他们也是建筑师，他们正在思考系统应该是什么样子。嗯，所以虽然我们90%的工程师都在使用某种**AI**工具，但其中大约30%的人以完全加速的速度使用它们。它确实以我从未见过的方式改变了他们的生产力。最终，我确实认为程序员的工作将越来越多地从实际编写代码，转变为在某种程度上协调编写代码的代理，或为你构建系统。它变得更像是一种协调工作，而不是手动编写工作。但工作仍然会在那里。我的态度是，如果我的普通工程师效率提高了25%，我们还没有达到，但我们会达到。我将雇佣更多的工程师，因为我想更快地前进。仍然有很多我们尚未解决的问题。但我可以想象，你知道，也许五年后，随着工程师的生产力越来越高，我可能不会决定增加工程人员，因为到那时，我应该增加代理并从**英伟达**购买更多的**GPU**，而不是增加一名工程师。那可能是未来的投资。我们拭目以待。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: yeah about 90% of our coders are using **AI** now that's easy to say but but there are probably 30% of them that were power users they are showing a clear um differentiation in the number of diffs for example how much a diff is a code release that's different from the last code release. So one of the measurements of productivity is just how many diffs are you putting to the codebase. **Uber**'s just a giant codebase. That's what we are. And so our engineers are literally the builders of the company. They are manufacturing the bricks that go into the system. Uh and they're architects who are kind of thinking about what the system should should look like. Uh, and so while 90% of our engineers are using **AI** tools of some sort, there's about 30% of them that are using them at a completely accelerated pace. And it really is changing their productivity in a way that I've never ever seen before. Ultimately, I do think that the job of a coder is going to change more and more from actually writing the code from to some extent orchestrating agents who are writing the code or building systems for you. It becomes more of an orchestration job versus a manual writing job. But the job will still be there. And my attitude is if my average engineer became 25 25% more efficient, which we haven't gone there yet, but we will get there. I'm gonna hire more engineers because I want to go faster. That there's still lots of unsolved problems that we haven't solved. But I can imagine, you know, maybe 5 years from now as the engineers get more and more productive, I may not decide to add engineering headcount because at that point instead of adding an engineer, I should add agents and buy some more **GPU**s from **Nvidia**. That may be the investment in the future. We'll see

</details>

**主持人**: 因为也考虑到线性与指数的关系。如果我们想象一个改进的速度，我不知道，在我看来，我会想，难道不会有一天，你作为首席执行官，或者你和你的高管团队，可以告诉一个代理你想要构建什么吗？你可以向它展示战略，理论上，我的意思是，我无法想象这怎么可能不实现。代理会然后构建，实际上也许他们甚至不需要你来设定战略。也许，但理论上，你知道，如果他们，如果你想象智能的任何改进速度，也许在某个时候他们会说：“好吧，听着，我们这里有一个更好的战略。”**DAR**……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: because thinking about linear versus exponential as well. If we imagine a rate of improvement, I don't know, in my head I go, well, won't there come a time where you as the CEO or you and a team, an executive team can tell an agent what you want to build? You can show it the strategy and theoretically, I mean, I can't figure out how this isn't going to be possible. The agents will then build and actually maybe they don't even need you to set the strategy. Maybe but theoretically, you know, if they if you imagine any rate of improvement in the intelligence, maybe at some point they're going to go, "Well, listen, we there's a better strategy here." **DAR**

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 我的一个团队成员告诉我，有些团队已经构建了一个**DAR AI**，你知道，所以他们基本上是向**DAR AI**进行演示，作为向我进行演示的准备，因为你可以想象，你知道，当一些东西到我这里时，已经经过了准备、会议，幻灯片也经过了精美打磨，所以他们有**DAR AI**来调整他们的准备。你担心他们可能会向董事会展示**DAR AI**吗？

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: what one of my uh uh one of my team members told me that some teams have built a **DAR AI** you know so so that they basically make the presentation to the **DAR AI** as a prep for making a presentation to me because you can imagine like you know by the time something comes to me there's been a prep and a meeting and the and the slide deck has been beautifully honed so they have **DAR AI** to tune their prep. Are you concerned they might show **DAR AI** to the board?

**主持人**: 我当时想，我当时想，我能看看**DAR AI**的代码吗？我很好奇。她说不，我们不会给你看。

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 我认为**AI**仍然缺少人类和其他生物所拥有的实时学习能力。对吧？所以如果你想想你我正在为这次对话学习，也许你的行为会因为你在这里学到的东西而改变0.1%，而大多数大型**AI**模型的构建方式是捕获基于你试图训练的技能集的巨量数据，预训练该模型，将其投入现实世界，然后根据来自世界的反馈对模型进行一些后训练，然后当模型发布时。它就是发布了，对吧？模型学习的方式是，你知道，35变成了38，但35并没有学习。工程师出去构建了，你知道，构建了一个新的模型，它是38，它可能包含35的一些元素等等。所以，**AI**代理现在还没有学习。现在我们正在做的很多事情是围绕基础模型进行构建，然后这些模型会带来来自现实世界的信号，并利用基础模型所拥有的技能来做好的事情。所以你可以……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: I think I think where **AI** still is missing a beat that humans and other creatures have is ability to learn real time. Right? So if if you think about you and I are learning for this conversation and maybe your behavior is going to change by 0.1% because of actually what you learn here and the construct of most large **AI** models is capture enorm enormous amounts of data based on the skill set that you're trying to drive train pre-train that model put it into the real world and then there's some post-training of the of the model based on feedback from from the world and then when the model's is released. It's kind of released, right? And the way the model learns is, you know, 35 becomes 38, but 35 didn't learn. The engineers went out and built, you know, built a new model that's 38 that might have elements of 35 to it, etc. So, the the **AI** agents aren't learning now. Now a lot of what we're doing is we're building around the foundation models that then bring kind of the signals from the real world and use the skills that the foundation models have to do good stuff. So you can

**主持人**: 后训练。我正在发布。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 完全正确。所以，我们正在进行后训练，但我们作为人类正在实时学习，当模型能够实时学习时……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Exactly. So well so we are post-training but we're learning real time as human beings and when the models can learn real time

</details>

**主持人**: 我认为那就是我将开始思考，是的，我们都是可替代的时刻。但在这一点上，我还没有看到一个能够实时学习的模型。**AI**领域的一个真正颠覆性领域是自动驾驶汽车。就在我们开始录音之前，我说我在洛杉矶有一辆**特斯拉**，我住在那里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: that I think is the point at which I'm going to kind of think yeah we are all replaceable but at this point I haven't seen a model that can learn real time. One of the real areas of disruption in **AI** has been autonomous vehicles. And I was just before we started recording, I was saying that uh I have a **Tesla** in LA where I live.

</details>

**主持人**: 令人震惊的是，我可以上车，按下一个按钮，然后开两个半小时到**约书亚树**，而无需触摸方向盘或踏板。

**主持人**: And it's staggering that I can get in the car, press a button, and drive two and a half hours to Joshua Tree without having to touch the wheel or the the pedals.

**主持人**: 现在驾驶，我认为是世界上最大的职业之一。作为一个职业。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Now driving, I think, is one of the biggest employees in the world. Like as a profession,

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 我的意思是，我们平台上有950万司机和快递员。我们是世界上最大的灵活工作组织者。我想第二大劳动力是**中国军队**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: I mean, we've got nine and a half million drivers and couriers on our platform. We are the largest organizer of flexible work around the world. and they I I think the second largest um workforce is a **Chinese army**.

**主持人**: 哇。

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 是的。我们组织了一大群人。

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Yeah. It's a big group of folks that we've organized

**主持人**: 从统计数据来看，自动驾驶**特斯拉**的事故比人类驾驶的要少。所以从统计数据来看，我的汽车自动驾驶比我驾驶更安全。这是真的，对吧？自动驾驶目前更安全。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: and statistically there's less accidents in an autonomous **Tesla** than there is if a human drives it. So it's safer for my car to drive itself statistically than for me to drive it. That's true, right? That the autonomous driving is currently safer.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 这是真的。所以**Waymo**更安全。然后现在你作为人类是**特斯拉**的备用，对吧？所以我也有一辆**特斯拉**。偶尔它会脱离，我必须，或者我必须脱离。所以它不一定是纯粹的自动驾驶代理比人类更好，但自动驾驶代理加上人类备用，毫无疑问比纯粹的人类更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: That's true. So **Whimos** are safer. And then now you are a backup to the **Tesla**, right, as a human being. So I've I've got a **Tesla** as well. And once in a while it disengages and I've got to or I've got to disengage. So it it's not necessarily the pure autonomous agent that's better than humans, but definitely the autonomous agent with a human backup. No question that's better than the pure human.

</details>

**主持人**: 我们离它只剩下……不远了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And we can't be far away from it just being

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 我的意思是**Waymo**已经做到了，对吧？你住在洛杉矶。他们有**Waymo**。我们在奥斯汀、亚特兰大与他们合作。根据所有报告，**Waymo**司机比人类更安全。这将在全世界的自动驾驶汽车中得到证实。你知道，全世界每年有数百万人死于驾驶。在美国，每年有35,000到40,000起汽车死亡事故。所以，如果这些自动驾驶代理和司机能够比人类更好，而且他们会随着时间的推移比人类更好，那么这将真正挽救人类生命。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: I mean **Whimo**'s there already, right? Uh you you live in LA. Uh they've got the **Whimos**. We work with them in Austin uh in Atlanta. And by all accounts, **Whimo** drivers are safer than human beings. And that's going to be true of AV all over the world. You know, there are million deaths uh from driving every year in the world. In the US, it's between 35,000 and 40,000 uh auto fatalities. So to the extent that these these autonomous agents and drivers can be better than humans and they will be better than humans over a period of time uh there's a real return on human life as a result of this

</details>

**主持人**: 你拥有的那900万司机职业，可以想象在未来会失业，你知道，坦诚地说。是的，我想这又回到了实体**AI**的问题，对吧？所以我想20年后，你可以想象那900万将变成2000万自动驾驶汽车，也许吧，但我们现在到那时之间还有时间，部分原因是我们不在虚拟世界中运营，对吧？我们在物理世界中运营。你必须制定法规。你必须制造汽车，你必须制造传感器堆栈，模型必须到位。所以现在到那时之间还有时间，但你可以想象我们的大部分行程将由某种机器人完成。可能不是10年后，但15、20年后，你就会开始看到这种情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: those 9 million drivers careers that you have will be out of work conceivably in the you know talking about being honest about the situation. Yeah, I think again it goes to physical **AI** as well, right? So I think 20 years from now, you can imagine that those 9 million will be 20 million uh AVs maybe, but we have time between now and then partially because we don't operate in the virtual world, right? We operate in the physical world. You have to get the regulations up. You have to build the cars, you have to build the sensor stacks, the the models have to get there. So there is time between now and then, but you can imagine the majority of our trips being fulfilled by robots of some kind. Probably not 10 years from now, but you go 15, 20 years from now, you're going to start getting there.

</details>

**主持人**: 那900万人该怎么办？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What do the 9 million people do?

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 我不知道。现在我们正在扩展平台上可用的工作类型，部分原因就是这个。对吧？我们以前唯一的工作就是驾驶。现在有送货。你也可以有购物员。我想至少在**AI**购物员出现之前还需要一段时间。现在我们实际上有一个团队叫做**Uber AI Solutions**，它允许人们训练这些代理，训练**AI**代理和**AI**模型，并在手机上进行各种知识型工作，以扩展我们在平台上为人类提供的各种工作，以及为他们提供不同的赚钱机会。所以我们正在扩展平台，然后问题是平台有多少部分会被自动化，以及我们扩展平台到其他类型工作的速度与自动化速度相比如何。我无法告诉你哪个会更快。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: I don't know. Now we are expanding the kind of work that's available on on on the platform partially as a result of it. Right? We used to be the only work is driving. Now there's delivering. You can have shoppers as well. I think it'll be a little while at least before you get **AI** shoppers. And now actually we have a team called **Uber AI Solutions** that uh allows people to train these same agents and train uh **AI** agents and **AI** models uh and do all kinds of knowledgebased work on their phone as well to kind of extend the kind of work that we offer uh humans on our platform and different opportunities for for them to to make money. So we are extending the platform and then the question is how much of the platform gets automated and what's the velocity at which we can extend our platform into other kinds of work versus the velocity of automation. I can't tell you which is going to go faster.

</details>

**主持人**: 但摸着良心说，在**AI**的世界里，失业率似乎会显著增加，特别是如果我们只想象这种持续的改进速度。我就是不能……

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: that's why there's a question here and I do think there's a real question as to the ability of societies to retrain the abilities of human beings to retrain themselves **AI** is going to be a part of that but the timing there how fast is it going to go it's a real question mark I I think you're absolutely I don't think it's going to be a big issue big issue uh in the next 5 years, but when you go 5 plus years, it's going to become more of a more more of an issue for society at large.

And I understand the incentive because if they were to start ringing the bell, it might hurt their own chance of like innovating and fundraising and all those things. But I think you sit at this sort of happy medium of being Yeah. as the CEO of **Uber**, you've got to you've got to pursue the opportunity in the technology. But on the other hand, to be honest and say, listen, there's going to be big disruption and we I don't know the answers.

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: how did how did the the Cuz I I looked before I came on. And I'm like, I'm going to look up on uh uh yeah, the CEOs. And there aren't that many CEOs.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，如果我看了你的日记，我会发现什么？我可能会发现你在与为人父、你的心理作斗争。我可能会在里面发现一些关于你健康的事情。我看得出来你是一个去健身房的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Well, if I looked at your diary, what would I find inside your diary? I would probably find you contending with being a father, your psychology. I might find some things in there about your health. I can see you're a guy that goes to the gym.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，我认为这一切都是相互关联的。我认为要成为一名杰出的首席执行官，你可能需要大量思考你的过去、你的童年、你的健康、你如何优化所有这些事情。所以老实说，你不能做这样的播客20年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Um and I think it's all interlin. I think for you to be an exceptional CEO, you probably think a lot about your past, your childhood, your health, your how to optimize and all these things. And so honestly, you can't do a podcast like this for 20 years

</details>

**主持人**: 每天都做同样的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: and just hit the same thing every day.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 你需要被智力刺激。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: You need to be I need to be intellectually stimulated.

</details>

**主持人**: 你我都是多面体生物，我想。所以这就是它进化的原因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And you and me are both multifaceted creatures, I guess. So that's why it's evolved

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 直到我们变成**AI**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: until we become **AI**s.

</details>

**主持人**: 直到我们变成**AI**。是的。那我们就此结束吧，嗯，从**AI**和自动驾驶的角度来看，我们能做些什么？这是政府的责任吗？还是集体行动？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Until we become **AI**s. Yeah. Just closing off on that then, um, what can we do about this from an **AI** AV perspective? Is it the government's responsibility? Is it collective action?

</details>

### AI与自动驾驶的未来

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 所以，我认为我们没有足够地谈论，例如，自动驾驶**AI**可以成为一股向善的力量，对吧？这些司机将比人类更安全，我们可以将35,000起死亡事故降至3,000起等等。我确实认为**AI**和自动驾驶将降低交通运输的价格。所以我们目标的重要一部分是让按需交通运输惠及所有人。我之前与一个人交谈时，她谈到**Uber**如何改变了她母亲的生活。她的妈妈可以四处走动，没有它就无法四处走动，对吧？我们希望有更多像她母亲一样的人。所以，我确实认为认识到如果交通运输，基础交通运输变得更安全，变得更便宜，回到**杰文斯悖论**，这对社会来说是好事，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: So one is I do think that we don't talk enough in that for example with autonomous **AI** can be a force for good right it's these drivers are going to be safer than human beings and those we can take the 35,000 fatalities to 3,000 fatalities etc. I do think that the **AI**'s the AV is going to bring down the price of transportation. So a a big part of our goal is to make ondemand transportation available for everybody. One of the folks that I was talking to was talking about how **Uber** has changed her mother's life. Like her mom can get around and it just wouldn't get around without it, right? We want more moms like that. So, I do think it's important to recognize that if transport fundamental transportation becomes safer, it becomes cheaper. Going back to **Jean's paradox**, that's a good thing for society, right?

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 我不认为就社会而言，答案是试图减缓变化的速度，因为例如，如果我们谈论西方，**中国**就不会。所以我认为你只需要积极投入。我认为像这样的讨论很重要。我认为你寻找那些正在谈论它的技术领导者。例如，**达里奥**，**Anthropic**正在谈论它，这让一些人生气，但我认为他在那里进行了很好的讨论。然后我确实认为，社会武装起来，能够大规模地再培训大量人群，这不是一种技能。我没有看到人们在这方面投入，我也没有看到这成为我们任何一个国家的核心能力等等。我能想到的只有一件事，那就是再培训机器。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: I don't think that the answer as it relates to society is to try to slow down the pace of change because **China** won't for example if we're uh talking about the west. So I think you just have to lean into it. I think that discussions like this are important. I think you look for technology leaders who are talking about it. **Daario**, for example, **Anthropic** is talking uh about it, pissing some people off, but I think he's having good discussions there. And then I do think that the the society arming up to be able to retrain large groups of people at scale is not a skill. I don't see people investing that and I don't see that as a core capability of any of our countries etc. There's one thing I can come up with, it will be that is the retraining machine.

</details>

**主持人**: 你有四个孩子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You've got f four kids.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Yes.

</details>

**主持人**: 他们来找你，他们说：“爸爸，听着。**AI**，机器人技术，给我一些关于我未来的建议。我应该做什么？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: They come to you, they say, "Dad, listen. **AI**, robotics, give me some advice for my future. What should I be doing?"

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 努力工作。你会没事的。努力工作。就是这样，我的意思是，现在**AI**理论上可以比你更努力地工作，但我发现我给年轻人的一条建议是不要计划。好吧。我最终，我们经历了历史。我最终走到今天，没有计划任何事情。当我是一名投资银行家时，我没有梦想成为首席执行官等等。我发现那些职业规划过于清晰，对自己在做什么过于清楚的人，他们失去了好奇心。人类会寻找积极的信号，对吧？无论你喜欢与否。任何时候有人同意你，都会让你感觉好一点，任何时候你得到与你先入为主的观念相悖的信号，你要么忽略它，要么你会说：“好吧，该死，我要接受它。”这很不愉快。所以对于职业规划，我发现那些职业规划过于清晰的人，他们会寻找符合他们职业规划的信号。我将在某个时候成为副总裁。我将在某个时候赚到X笔钱。他们不会四处张望，他们不好奇。他们不会寻找可以改变他们生活的信号。所以，我告诉一些人，在你出去试图改变世界之前，先让世界改变你。你知道，接受输入。如果你是这样，你就会戴上眼罩，因为我要去这里。你不会接受输入。你不会接受来自世界的所有刺激。尽管，你知道，我看到的一个不变的规律是，优秀的人就是优秀。优秀的人。我从未见过一个成功的人在工作中或职业生涯中不努力工作就能达到目标。我的猜测是，我不知道你，你最终走到今天，有点是偶然。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Work hard. You're going to be fine. Work hard. It's it's just that's I mean, now the **AI** theoretically can can work harder than you, but I I find one of the pieces of advice I give to young people is don't plan. Okay. I wind up, we went through a history. I wound up where I am today having not planned a thing. I didn't when I was an investment banker. I wasn't dreaming of becoming CEO, etc. And and what I find is that people who have too much of a career plan, who have too much clarity about what they're doing, they they lose their curiosity. And and human beings look for positive signal, right? you whether you like it or not. Anytime someone agrees with you makes you feel a little bit better, anytime you get signal that goes against your preconceived notions, either you ignore it or you're like, "All right, [ __ ] I'm going to I'm going to take this on." It's unpleasant. And so with with career planning, what I find is people who have too clear uh career plan, they're looking for signals that feed into their career plan. I'm going to be a vice president by this much. I'm going to make X money by this much. and they're not looking around, they're not being curious. They're not looking for signal that can change, you know, their life. And and and so what I tell some folks is like before you go out and try to change a world, let the world change you first. You know, take input. And if you're like this, you got blinders cuz I'm going here. You're not going to take input. You're not going to let you're not going to take all the stimulus coming in from the world. though it's, you know, the one constant I see is people who are good are good. People who are good. I've never seen a successful person in in a job or a career get there without working hard. And my guess is, I don't know about you, you kind of wound up where you're wound up kind of by accident.

</details>

**主持人**: 人们会说，你真幸运。我能来到这里非常幸运。我有很多这样的时刻，有些人会说我利用了这种运气，但在某种程度上，我能够利用这种运气是因为我乐于接受。你从**Expedia**跳槽到**Uber**。嗯，部分原因是我们共同的朋友，**Spotify**的创始人**丹尼尔·埃克**给你的一些建议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And people are like, well, you got lucky. I got very lucky to be here. like I had so many kind of moments and and some would say I took advantage of that l of of that luck but to some extent I was able to take advantage of that luck because I was open being open. You jumped from **Expedia** to **Uber**. Um in part helped by some advice that our mutual friend **Daniel E** the founder of **Spotify** gave you.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 他实际上刚刚给我发了短信。我给他发短信说，嘿，你能，你能给我发个问题问**达里奥**吗？但他现在正在我们谈话的时候发短信。该死。不，就在我进来之前，我刚看了。他给我回短信说他正在开财报电话会议。没关系。但是，嗯，他说：“祝你采访顺利。”嗯，**丹尼尔·埃克**对你说了什么，帮助你做出了去**Uber**的决定？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: He's actually just text me. I text him saying hey can you uh can you send me a question to ask **Dario** but he said I'm in the middle of now texting while we're talking. Damn it. No, just before I walked in, I've just looked. He texted me back saying he's on an earnings call. Never mind. But um he said, "Good luck with the interview." Um what did **Daniel X** say to you that helped to form that decision to go to **Uber**?

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 所以他是推荐我的人，我想当时我被猎头联系了。他把我推荐给了给我打电话的猎头。我告诉他我当时正在参加**艾伦公司**的会议，又回到了与他的圈子里，我们有一天晚上喝酒，他问我，他说：“猎头给你打电话了吗？”有这个**Uber**的职位，当时**Uber**简直是一场灾难，每个人都在读关于它的新闻。我在**Expedia**。我刚刚得到了你一开始说的那个很棒的合同。所以我打算留下，我喜欢为**巴里**工作。我们，这，这，这，一直是我职业生涯中最好的合作关系。我说我当然不会去。你知道，我对我在**Expedia**所做的事情非常满意。然后**丹尼尔**看着我。他有着他那冰冷的斯堪的纳维亚人的眼睛。他说：“**达拉**，生活什么时候是关于快乐的了？它是关于产生影响的。**Uber**是一家伟大的公司，你可以在那家公司产生影响。你必须做这件事。”所以第二天我给之前打过电话的猎头打了电话。我说：“不，不，我不感兴趣。”第二天我给猎头打了电话，我说：“我们谈谈吧。”所以**丹尼尔**是启发我的人。你父亲，他给了你建议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: So he's the one who recommended I think I was I was uh contacted by head hunter. He recommended me to the head hunter who called me. Uh I told him I was actually at the **Allen and Company** conference going back in a a circle with him and we were having a drink one night and he asked me, he's like, "Did the head hunter call you?" there's this **Uber** roll and at the at the time **Uber** was a disaster like disaster and everyone was reading about it. I was at **Expedia**. I had just gotten this wonderful contract that you said at the beginning. So I was I was going to stay and I love working for **Barry**. We're like it it it's been it's been the best professional partnership of of my life. And I said of course I'm not going to go. You know I'm so happy about what I'm doing at **Expedia**. And **Daniel** like looks at me. He's got his like cold Scandinavian eyes. He's like, "**Dra**, since when is life about being happy? It's about making impact. **Uber** is a great company and you can have an impact on that company. You've got to do this." So the next day I had called the head hunter previously. I said, "No, no, I'm not interested." The next day I called the head hunter and I said, "Let's talk." So **Daniel** was the one who opened me up. And your dad, he gave you advice.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 嗯，我跟我父亲谈过，嗯，他，我父亲总是把事情简单化，他说：“只要一家公司，一个动词，告诉你去经营它，你就说‘是’。”所以，我认为那是一个很好的建议。最终，我想那些来到**Uber**的人会留在**Uber**。他们因为挑战而来，但因为影响力而留下。我们正在建立一家对世界很重要的公司，对我来说，我能来，我能对一家有影响力的公司产生影响。所以为什么不呢？当他说一家公司是一个动词时，他指的是在出租车或交通运输领域，每个人都把**Uber**当作一个动词来使用，即使他们谈论的是竞争对手。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Well, I talked to my dad and uh his my dad is keeps things simple and he said, "Do you as far as he when a company who's a verb tells you to run it, you just say yes." So, I thought that was good uh good advice. And and ultimately I think people who come to **Uber** stay at **Uber**. They come because of the challenge but they stay because of the impact. Like we are building a company that is important to the world and for me I could come and I could have an I could have impact on impactful company. So why the hell not? And when he says a company that's a verb, he's referring to the fact that everybody in the the taxiing or transportation category uses **Uber** as a verb to even if they're talking about a competitor.

</details>

**主持人**: 完全正确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Exactly. Right.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯，每个行业总有一家公司拥有它们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Um and there's always one company in every sort of industry that owns them.

</details>

**主持人**: 我们这里有一个结束传统，上一位嘉宾会为下一位嘉宾留下一个问题，而不知道他们是为谁留下的。留给你的问题是，如果你能时光倒流，今天会进行哪次对话，但现在已经无法进行了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: We have a closing tradition here where the last guest leaves a question for the next guest not knowing who they're leaving it for. And the question left for you is, what is one conversation that if you could rewind time and have you would have today but can no longer have?

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 那是与我父亲的一次对话。嗯，你知道，我告诉过你我从旧金山来到纽约，嗯，那是因为我父亲年纪很大了，他正在失去他的心智能力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: It was a conversation with with my dad. Um, you know, I told you I came to New York from San Francisco and uh it was because my dad was getting very old and he was losing his mental facilities.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 我很高兴我回来了，我得以和他共度时光。但那些最后的时光，你知道，当我与他共度时光时，那已经不是真正的他了。我希望我能和他谈谈他的经历，他年轻时的生活，建立一些东西的兴奋，以及他生活中所经历的失去和遗憾。我从未有过，你知道，我与他的关系，虽然有爱。毫无疑问有爱，但我们没有进行那种深入的对话，我当然希望我能和我的孩子们进行那种对话。所以，那是我很想进行的一次对话。你无法挽回时间。嗯，那是人生悲剧之一，但它也是人生美好之一，你知道，那就是你犯的一些错误是永久性的。嗯，你无法挽回。但我的，然后与你进行真诚的对话，与我的朋友建立联系，并不仅仅是与我的妻子和孩子，而是与我的同事建立真正的关系。你知道，我们进行那些真诚的对话和联系，嗯，是我弥补我从未与父亲进行过的那次对话的方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: And I'm glad I came back and I got to spend time with him. But those last times, you know, when I spent time with him, it wasn't really him. And I wish I could talk to him about his experiences, his younger life, the excitement of building something and then the loss and regrets he had in in life as well. I never had, you know, my relationship with him was kind of was there was love. No question about love, but we didn't have the deep kind of conversations that certainly I'm hoping I get to have with my kids. So, that's a conversation I'd love to have. And you can't get time back. Uh, and that's one of the tragedies of life, but it's also one of the beauties of life, you know, which is there are some mistakes that you make that are permanent. Um, and you can't get that back. But my then making genuine conversations with you and connections with my friends and having a real relationship not just with my wife and my kids, but actually like with my workmates. you know, we having those genuine conversations and connections um is my way of correcting for the conversation I never had with my dad.

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

</details>

**主持人**: 你在很多方面都是我的巨大灵感，现在更是如此，因为我为你这次对话做了这么多研究。因为，找到一位在不同领域持续成功的领导者，他建立了这种在我看来相当罕见的技能栈，从投资到首席财务官，然后能够转型为首席执行官，然后反复应对转型时刻，并为我们所有创始人、企业家提供了应对这种转型的框架，这确实是罕见的。我从你身上学到的最伟大的东西之一是诚实。是的，诚实是如此强大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You're a huge inspiration for me in so many ways and even more so now having done so much research on you in preparation for this conversation because it is it is rare to find a leader who has been consistently successful across different domains who's built this really really in my opinion quite rare skill stack from investing to CFO to then being able to transition to CEO and then has repeatedly contended with moments of transition and given us all frameworks as founders and entrepreneurs for how to deal with that transition. One of the great ones I take away from you is is honesty. Yeah, honesty is so powerful.

</details>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: 我告诉你，我从我妻子那里学到了这项技能。她总是说，人就是人。没关系。你知道，他们吃东西，他们抱怨，他们需要睡觉。她对待生活中每个人都一样，无论他们的职位如何。而且，嗯……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Dara Khosrowshahi**: And I'll tell you, I learned I learned that skill from my wife. She's just she she's always like people are people. Doesn't matter.

**主持人**: 就像你父亲一样。
