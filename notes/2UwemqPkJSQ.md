It's the weekend. The kids are out of the house, and that means one thing. It's time to test a new AI agent. Today, I'm going to give you my first pass opinion about Muse, Meta's new personal agent. We're going to talk about what Muse is, what I had it do for me, and what it didn't do quite well, and why I think it might be my favorite designed agent I played with in a long time. Let's get to it. Optimizely agent platform for marketers is built on a bigger idea. A whole directory of agents now joined by a newly revealed squad of virtual teammates. Each with a defined role and a personality of their own. This isn't about faster drafts. It's about handling the coordination, too. The research, the approvals, the handoffs, the routing, the back and forth that quietly eats your week and never makes it into anyone's highlight reel. Get the story behind it all. Hear the confessions from marketers who have handed off the busy work. Meet the squad and understand what virtual teammates can do for you at optimizely.com/howiAI. First, before I get into what I loved about Muse, let's talk about what Muse is. So, Muse is from Meta. Yes, Instagram, Facebook, Meta, that Meta. And they're positioning it as your personal AI agent that gets things done. Don't we all want this? Now, let me tell you what I can for sure verify having looked at the landing page for Muse. This is for me. This is for millennials with kids, maybe Gen X with kids. This is for the olds. So, if you are a young person, I'm sure you can find many use cases for Muse. It's actually pretty great. But if you look at what they're targeting in terms of use cases and ideas, it is 100% for parents. You see here, they are going to highlight things like filling out permission slips, shopping for strollers, all those sorts of things. So, this is going to be an AI that is really well targeted, and spoiler alert, I actually really like it. I'm going to go through why I really like it and what I would use it for and where it surprised me in a good way.

### 底层架构：专属云端虚拟机与持久化多端生态

在产品底层架构层面，Muse 采用了一套与普通聊天机器人截然不同的系统方案。它为每位用户在云端独立分配了一台 **虚拟专用机**（Virtual Machine / Cloud Computer：具备独立存储、计算与内存资源的云端计算环境），能够执行类似个人电脑上的复杂文件操作与环境调度。尽管普通大众可能并不关心底层算力配置，但对于技术早期采用者而言，这种架构赋予了代理极高的任务上限与隔离执行能力。

在跨平台协同上，Muse 覆盖了桌面端与移动端，并原生接入了 Meta 生态的核心入口 **WhatsApp**。这意味着用户无需改变现有的沟通习惯，即可随时随地向代理指派任务。更具突破性的是其 **全局持久化上下文**（Persistent Context）能力：用户与 Muse 的每次对话并非孤立的 Session，它具备全局跨会话记忆，能够持续学习用户的家庭结构、习惯偏好及过往任务资产，构建出真正具备连续性的个人知识库。

So, let's get into the technical architecture. Number one, it is a personal cloud computer. They are giving each user an entire personal cloud computer with dedicated storage, CPU, and memory to do the kinds of things you do on your own computer. That is clearly like not what my mom is going to care about. This is clearly not what the like middle of the road consumer is going to care about. I as an early adopter who is probably the target audience for Muse cares about this but I don't think anybody else does. The other thing is Muse has desktop and mobile. You can also communicate with it through WhatsApp. So again like ease of communication using the Meta ecosystem really useful. It really solves for cross platform, which is great. It is connected. So it uses WhatsApp as the primary communication, which I think is very interesting. And lastly, it's personal. So this is going to be dedicated to you and can be tailored to you over time. They are saying it has shared memory. So unlike ChatGPT where it creates a new memory artifact for every chat, this has one shared memory across all of your chats, all of your artifacts, everything. I'll show you what that looks like. It actually is pretty smart. And you can manage permissions in one central hub. It's connected. It can access Google Drive, Google Calendar, browse the web, create code, execute and download code, and use apps. That is cool. This is a very cool step in a new direction. And it has a really nice UX, including personality.

### 入门体验与自主建档：从日历同步到家庭画像反推

在完成系统初始化并为代理设定专属昵称（例如命名为 **Polly**）后，即可进入引导流程。针对“孩子日程繁杂、二娃退出足球队导致安排混乱”的实际痛点，将 Muse 与 **Google Calendar**（谷歌日历）进行授权连接。在极度平滑且安全的授权完成后，代理仅需获取孩子的基本名字，便开始全自动解析日历中的海量历史事件。

令人惊艳的是其强大的 **上下文推理能力**（Context Inference）。Muse 不仅准确提取了孩子们柔术、篮球、钢琴等课外兴趣班的时间线，还基于日历数据精准反推出了家庭生活画像：推断出家庭居住在旧金山且积极参与社区公共事务、父母从事科技与 AI 行业、热衷个人技术探索，并频繁使用外卖与线上购物服务。在用户确认该画像准确无误后，Muse 迅速将这些离散的日程与家庭偏好编译成一份排版精美、结构严谨的家庭每周生活简报 PDF 文档。

Now the other thing is it lets you pick an identity. I love an identity. I want my agents to be cute and named. So, right off the bat, I was asked, "What do you want to name your agent?" And of course, I named my agent Polly. Up in the top right, it used to be this little like yeti style animated fuzzy guy. And I will show you the process by which we updated the avatar. It's really cute. We'll give Polly a little makeover. But I named her Polly. And why did I name her Polly? Polly is my beloved cat who is no longer with us. Rest in peace, Polly. She was my first child and she was sassy and smart and wonderful and lovely. And so I named my agent Polly, which I really like. The settings are also really nice. It gives you this clear indication of what it is connected to. I have Google Drive, Google Calendar. It has memory and then integrations like Stripe for identity. It's going to use this for purchases. So, there is a path to full agentic, which again are very interesting, but I want to get into just the first chat I did with Polly. So, past naming Polly, I, you know, asked it for one thing. I said, "I need to stay on top of my kids schedule. They have so much going on. My middle kid quit soccer. Like, help." And it went through this very, very nice onboarding experience for me. It asked me for Google calendar. I connected. It was super easy, not scary. Then it asked for my kids names, which we won't show you. And then it said, you know, "I'm going to look through your calendar. I'm going to find all the kids events." And it did. It found all the kids events, which are substantial. And then it asked if it could create a recurring newsletter, a PDF newsletter for me to stay on top of the kids schedules. And of course, I was like, "Yeah, that's awesome. I would love a PDF newsletter." And so it did that. And as part of that onboarding, it was able to look at my calendar and deduce from my calendar a set of memories. So, it made these memories: It found the kids' activities like they do jiu-jitsu and basketball and piano and all this kind of stuff. It inferred that we're civically engaged in San Francisco. It inferred that we work in tech, that we care about tech and AI, that we'd like to do personal projects. And then it says like you do a lot of like food delivery and shopping, which is correct. And I said, "Yep, that sounds like us. Please build this this PDF newsletter." So, it started to work on it and it gave me this beautiful thing and I just cannot say enough about this artifact.

### 多模态资产与全流程追踪：动效设计与认知透明度

在产物交付与多模态生成上，Muse 展现出了成熟的 **系统化设计美学**。在其内置的个人资料库（Library）中，集中归档了代理生成的所有资产。除了常规的高质量 PDF 报表与前端网页代码外，Muse 还深度整合了图像、视频乃至 **AI 播客**（AI-generated Podcast：通过多角色语音合成技术自动生成的对话式音频内容）的自动化制作。在育儿场景下，甚至可以根据孩子的睡前喜好，一键生成结构完整的有声故事播客。

更具工程参考价值的是其 **执行透明度界面**（Execution Transparency & Traceability）。当代理执行任务时，界面会展开清晰的可视化时间线，完整展示每一步的推理过程、虚拟机内部的文件读写以及环境依赖安装（如后台执行 `pip install reportlab` 编译 PDF）。这种将技术黑盒转化为直观动效（如小兔子在电脑前打字、任务推演气泡）的设计，不仅极大降低了等待焦虑，也为专业开发者提供了类似高阶编码工具的执行溯源体验。

Before we look at the artifact, if you're building with AI agents or generating creative assets, I want to share a tool that's made a huge difference in my workflow: OpenArt. With OpenArt, you can combine prompts, reference images, and exact style controls to get consistent, high quality output with top models for images, video, and music. I create a lot of assets with AI. The problem is figuring out prompts, models, and settings before you can make anything good. OpenArt's new chat mode changes that. Chat with it like you would with ChatGPT. Whether you're creating an ad, a short film, or a promo video, start with a rough idea and it can develop the concept and script with you. Chat mode chooses the right models and settings based on what you describe, or you can specify exactly what you want. You can generate and refine images, videos, and music with multiple models, including Kling, Runaway, Flux, Hailuo, and SD3, all in one place. And if you're building an agent or want to automate workflows, OpenArt has an API for images, video, face swap, and more. Try it at openart.ai/howiai. Now let's get back to Muse. Look at how awesome this PDF is. It created a custom calendar. It included the drop off and pick up times. It added gentle reminders about what needs to happen. It gave us a list of tasks. It gave us a meal planner based on our schedule. It's clean, it's actionable, and it didn't require 15 prompt iterations to get something readable. It was just one shot, high quality design right out of the box. Next, let's talk about the memory architecture. As you use it, you can view and edit the knowledge graph it's building about you. It creates suggestions for what it can help you do. Every, you know, it said that I'm civically engaged. So, it's like if there's a pothole or busted street light, I can try to get it fixed. It has obviously the productivity things like managing your inbox, managing returns, but also has awesome things like relationships where it can host a trivia night for you or set up a dinner with a friend that you haven't spent time with in a long time. I think this is going to be a killer app for health and fitness. I think we're going to see a lot of people using this to track their meals, to get workout plans. And you can see here, you can add custom memories or delete memories it got wrong. The control over data is right there in the UI, which is great. Now, I tried giving it a complex real-world goal. I asked it to help me develop a gentle sleep training plan for my 8.5 month old. We room-share in a small house, and sleep deprivation is real. Muse's response blew me away not because it gave me a generic medical textbook answer, but because of the empathy and personalization. It said, "Sleep deprivation with a baby is its own special kind of hard. We'll get you some rest." It created a phased, day-by-day plan taking into account our small house layout and room sharing. It felt like talking to a thoughtful expert consultant. Then there is the Library. In the Library, you see every artifact Muse has built. It can generate documents, full static websites, images, videos, and podcasts. Yes, podcasts. You can ask it to generate an audio podcast briefing of your day or a custom bedtime story for your kids with different character voices, and it produces a fully playable audio track. When it executes, you can click on 'Show Work' and inspect the entire run trace: what Python libraries it installed in its cloud VM (like reportlab), what system files it modified, and its step-by-step reasoning chain. It is delightful and transparent.

### 拟人化重塑与多模态生成交互

在系统个性化配置方面，Muse 提供了极具温度的交互体验。系统不仅支持对代理名字的修改，还允许用户直接通过自然语言重绘其视觉形象（Avatar）。例如要求将默认形象更换为一只“蓝绿色的可爱小龙”，并将名字同步更新为孩子最喜爱的毛绒玩具昵称。在触发图像与多媒体生成任务时，界面会优雅地浮现一个发光的球体动画，直观传达后台正在进行的生成计算。

在处理复杂的家庭生活咨询（如定制婴儿温和睡眠训练方案）时，Muse 展现出了恰到好处的情感共鸣。它在提供分阶段实操计划的同时，能敏锐识别父母在极度缺觉状态下的心理压力，以温暖且具建设性的口吻进行沟通。这种将高情感价值与严谨结构化方案相结合的能力，显著提升了人机协作的信任感。

Now, let's talk about the avatar customization. I decided to give Polly a makeover. I said, "I love you, but let's change your avatar to a teal adorable dragon, and update your name to Slime, which is my kid's favorite stuffed animal." Polly immediately spun up its VM, pulled up an image generation tool, and you see this glowing orb animation on screen indicating that creative generation is underway. Within seconds, it generated an adorable teal dragon avatar and applied it globally across the application. It's such a small detail, but it makes the agent feel alive and deeply personalized. The personality settings allow you to dial in tone, humor, and verbosity. It doesn't feel like a cold command-line utility; it feels like an approachable companion designed for everyday life.

### 工具调用短板：网页浏览局限与支付闭环探索

尽管在上下文推理与静态产物生成上表现亮眼，但在面对复杂的 **实时网页浏览与动态操作**（Browser Use）时，Muse 暴露出了明显的短板。在实测其执行“购买两张近期热门重映电影《魔法灰姑娘》（Practical Magic）电影票”的任务时，Muse 在云端虚拟机中启动了自主浏览器，但在搜索与多轮页面导航过程中出现了偏离意图的现象——由于抓取逻辑不够稳健，它频繁陷入关联电影或无关演出的检索分支，无法迅速精确定位本地影院的上映场次。

与专门优化浏览器屏幕视觉感知的专业级 Agent 相比，Muse 目前在动态 DOM 解析与复杂多步跳转上的执行效率仍有待提升。不过在交易链路的设计上，Meta 展现了清晰的商业化路径：通过原生集成 **Stripe**（全球在线支付基础设施服务商），当代理最终锁定目标商品或票务后，可由用户授权绑定虚拟支付卡实现一键代付。虽然由于时间精力所限并未真正完成出票，但这种“意图解析 - 网页检索 - 支付授权”的完整闭环，展示了个人代理接管生活琐事的巨大商业潜力。

Now let's talk about where Muse struggled: browser use. You all know I test a lot of browser automation agents. I asked Muse to buy two tickets to the re-release of Practical Magic at a local theater. Muse spun up its internal cloud browser. It gives you a live interactive view of what the VM browser is seeing, which is fantastic for safety and transparency. However, its actual browsing navigation was clunky. It kept getting sidetracked by secondary links, looking up Practical Magic 2 news instead of showtimes, and struggling with complex interactive seat pickers. A specialized browser agent would have crushed this in 30 seconds, whereas Muse stumbled around for several minutes. But here is where it gets interesting: once it did find the checkout page, it prompted me for Stripe integration. You can connect Stripe Link, issue a virtual card with spend limits, and let the agent complete the purchase autonomously. I didn't end up buying the tickets because with young kids I won't be seeing a 3-hour movie anytime soon, but the end-to-end flow from natural language to payment authorization is fundamentally the right model for consumer AI agents.

To wrap up: Muse is easily one of the most thoughtfully designed consumer agents I have used. It's not trying to replace a senior software engineer; it is built to help busy parents and everyday people manage the overwhelming logistics of modern life. The combination of a dedicated cloud VM, persistent cross-chat memory, empathetic conversational design, and rich artifact generation (PDFs, podcasts, web pages) makes it an absolute joy to use. While its web browsing capabilities still need polish to match top-tier coding and browser agents, the foundation Meta has laid here is remarkable. For those worried about Meta and privacy: having used their platforms for decades, the trade-off of deep personalization against existing data footprints is a familiar equation, and the central permission controls in Muse are a step in the right direction. I'm excited to continue testing their underlying models and see how Muse evolves. Thanks so much for watching. If you enjoyed this breakdown, please like, subscribe, and leave a comment.
