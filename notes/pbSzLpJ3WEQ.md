### 爱泼斯坦案的深远影响与名人网络

《纽约时报》的报道聚焦于**爱泼斯坦**（Jeffrey Epstein）文件案的最新进展，揭示了一个不断扩大的、涉及众多知名人士的复杂关系网络。随着最新一批文件的公开，调查人员正在梳理爱泼斯坦的社交圈及其如何利用这些关系。报道指出，在这些文件中，不乏他与皇室成员的频繁互动记录。例如，一封发给爱泼斯坦的电子邮件显示，挪威王储妃梅特-玛丽特（Crown Princess Märtha Louise of Norway）称他为“甜心”。这封邮件发送于2012年，彼时爱泼斯坦已因招揽未成年人进行性交易而被定罪四年。另一封邮件中，英国前公爵夫人**莎拉·弗格森**（Sarah Ferguson）向爱泼斯坦表达了感激之情，暗示爱泼斯坦可能为其及女儿的航班支付了费用。爱泼斯坦似乎期望她能帮助改善其公众形象，建议她发表声明，证明他“不是恋童癖”。

文件中充斥着类似的事件。亿万富翁**彼得·蒂尔**（Peter Thiel）曾向爱泼斯坦提供投资建议；爱泼斯坦则帮助**伍迪·艾伦**（Woody Allen）及其妻子联系了巴德学院（Bard College）的校长，试图安排他们的女儿入学。此外，**比尔·盖茨**（Bill Gates）、**埃隆·马斯克**（Elon Musk）、**理查德·布兰森**（Richard Branson）、**谢尔盖·布林**（Sergey Brin）以及一位前以色列总理的名字也出现在相关记录中。随着更多细节浮出水面，许多与爱泼斯坦有关联的人士纷纷发表道歉或澄清声明。一些人因此失去了职位，并可能面临其他后果。例如，一位美国顶级艺术博物馆的前负责人本周已辞职，一家顶级企业律师事务所的负责人也因其与爱泼斯坦的亲密往来记录公开而辞职。在伦敦，警方已就前驻美大使**彼得·曼德尔森**（Peter Mandelson）被指控向爱泼斯坦传递机密政府信息一事展开刑事调查。目前，文件中尚未发现支持围绕爱泼斯坦最持久的阴谋论的证据——即他收集其富裕、有权势且著名的熟人的“黑料”，以用于敲诈勒索或其他目的。

From the [music] New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Friday, February 6th. [music] Here's what we're covering. The Crown Princess of Norway, the man in charge of the upcoming Olympics in LA, the former British ambassador to the US. The list of prominent and powerful names surfacing in the Epstein files keeps growing, revealing a staggering web of connections. My colleagues have spent the last week combing through the latest batch of documents, tracing Jeffrey Epstein's relationships and how in some cases he tried to leverage them. There are frequent moments where he's chatty with royals. [music] You are such a sweetheart, reads one email sent to him apparently by Crown Princess Metamerit of Norway. >> [music] >> It came in 2012, 4 years after Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting a minor for sex. In another email, Sarah Ferguson, the British ex duchess, [music] told Epstein she didn't have the words to describe the love or gratitude she felt for him after Epstein likely paid for flights for her and her daughters. Epstein seemed to hope she would help him with his image problem, suggesting she release a statement that he was quote not a pedto. The documents are littered with stories like this. The billionaire Peter Teal giving Epstein investment advice or Epstein helping Woody Allen and his wife connect with the president of Bard College to try and get their daughter admitted. Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Richard Branson, Sergey Brin, and a former Israeli prime minister all make appearances. As more details have surfaced, there have been a flurry of apologies and statements by people trying to clarify their connection to Epstein. Some have lost their positions and may face other consequences. A former head of some of America's top art museums stepped down this week. So did the head of one of the country's top corporate law firms after their chummy messages with Epstein became public. And in London, police have opened a criminal investigation into Peter Mandelen, the former ambassador who's been accused of passing confidential government information to Epstein. For now, there's been no evidence in the files of what has been one of the most enduring conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein that he was gathering dirt on his wealthy, powerful, and famous acquaintances that he could have potentially used for blackmail or other purposes.

### 耐克DEI调查引发的合规与公平争议

本周，负责执行劳动法的联邦机构表示，正就**耐克**（Nike）涉嫌歧视白人雇员的指控展开调查。美国平等就业机会委员会（EEOC）称，其正在审查“与DEI（多元、公平和包容）相关的系统性蓄意种族歧视指控”。该机构正试图强制耐克遵守一项传票要求，以获取有关其为提升员工和高层领导种族多样性所做的一系列努力的信息。耐克方面称此举“令人惊讶且不同寻常”，并表示已在配合EEOC的工作。此举似乎是该委员会首次明确表示，DEI实践可能构成对美国白人的歧视。这也将该机构及其特朗普提名的主席**安德烈亚·卢卡斯**（Andrea Lucas）置于本届政府广泛打击多元化项目的前沿。

卢卡斯自去年接管EEOC以来，一直积极征集白人男性的投诉，并在近期接受《纽约时报》采访时表示，她的使命是“恢复对平等的关注，而非对公平（equity）的关注”。批评者，包括前EEOC委员，指责卢卡斯歪曲了该机构的初衷——该机构源于《民权法案》，旨在保护弱势工人。在卢卡斯领导下，EEOC近期撤销了旨在保护雇员免受职场骚扰（包括基于性取向和性别认同的骚扰）的指导方针。一位全国性工人权利组织的民权专家称此举“激进且有害”，并表示卢卡斯“向那些被总统视为不受欢迎的群体关闭了EEOC的大门”。

[music] This week, the federal agency that enforces employment law said that it is investigating Nike over allegations that it discriminated against white workers. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or EEOC said that it's looking at quote systemic allegations of DEI related intentional race discrimination. The agency is currently trying to force Nike to comply with a subpoena seeking information about a range of efforts to boost racial diversity among its employees and senior leadership. Nike called it a surprising and unusual escalation and said it had already been cooperating with the EEOC. The move appears to be the first time the commission has said that DEI practices can be considered discrimination against white Americans. It also puts the agency and its Trump nominated chair, Andrea Lucas, at the forefront of the administration's broad assault on diversity programs. >> Are you a white male who's experienced discrimination at work based on your race or sex? You may have a claim to recover money under federal civil rights laws. Since taking charge of the EEOC last year, Lucas has solicited complaints from white men and said in a recent interview with the Times that her mission is to quote, "Restore a focus on equality as opposed to equity." Critics of Lucas, including former EEOC commissioners, have accused her of distorting the intent of the agency, which was born out of the Civil Rights Act to protect vulnerable workers. Under Lucas, the EEOC recently rolled back guidance for employers that was supposed to protect against workplace harassment, including on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. A civil rights expert at a national workers rights group called the move radical and harmful, saying that Lucas had quote closed the door of the EEOC to groups that are disfavored by the president.

### 美国外交策略与能源议题的交织

在**特朗普**（Trump）政府的国内政策方面，白宫已启动一个新网站 **trumprx.gov**，旨在通过帮助美国人直接从药品制造商处购买药品来降低处方药成本。该网站被设想为一个门户，供人们搜索特定药物，并可能找到直接向消费者销售的制造商。然而，研究药物定价的研究人员表示，这一目标可能难以全面实现。例如，他们警告称，一些有健康保险的美国人如果使用该网站，可能会支付过高的价格。但对于没有保险的人来说，在Trump RX上找到的价格可能低于他们直接去药房购买的价格。

在中东地区，特朗普政府的高级顾问正准备与伊朗举行会谈，此前特朗普已加大对该国的压力。总统的女婿**贾里德·库什纳**（Jared Kushner）将与特朗普的特使**史蒂夫·维科夫**（Steve Wickoff）一同在阿曼与伊朗外交部长面对面会晤。特朗普近期已将军舰调往该地区，并威胁除非伊朗同意其一系列要求，否则将对其发动打击。这些要求包括冻结其核计划、减少弹道导弹储备以及停止支持武装团体。中东外交官告诉《纽约时报》，他们希望美国能专注于伊朗的核计划，并担心其他要求可能会导致会谈在开始前就失败。

与此同时，委内瑞拉的石油与美国本土生产的石油在性质上存在显著差异：它更脏、更重，含硫量更高，这使得提炼过程更为复杂。**赫罗科·布奇**（Heroko Tbuchi）报道了特朗普政府对委内瑞拉及其石油的计划如何在一个美国小镇敲响了警钟。该镇位于墨西哥湾沿岸，拥有一座大型专业化的**雪佛龙**（Chevron）炼油厂，是美国少数几个能够处理委内瑞拉特有石油种类的地区之一。自政府着手促进委内瑞拉石油出口以来，当地居民正为可能带来的影响做准备。密西西比州帕斯卡古拉（Pascagoula）的一些居民担心，他们本已面临的空气污染问题可能会变得更加严重。有居民表示，他们社区几乎每个家庭都有人患有某种形式的癌症，并经历了持续的鼻窦炎、流鼻涕、头痛和皮肤刺激。雪佛龙自身的监测数据显示，该地区偶尔会出现致癌物**苯**（benzene）的峰值。随着更多委内瑞拉石油可能在该地区被加工，一些居民加倍施压，要求雪佛龙回购他们的房屋并支付他们搬迁的费用。雪佛龙公司表示，几十年来一直安全地加工委内瑞拉风格的石油，并对居民的回购请求持不置可否的态度，但表示愿意与社区合作。

Now, two more quick updates on the Trump administration. Everybody, you're going to save a fortune. And this is also so good for overall healthcare. And >> as of last night, the White House has launched a new website aimed at lowering the cost of prescriptions by helping Americans buy medicine directly from drug makers. The site, trumprx.gov, gov is intended to be a portal where people can search for specific drugs and potentially find manufacturers who sell them direct to consumer, though people will still need a prescription. The administration has claimed Americans will save money on the site, though researchers who study drug pricing say that likely won't be true across the board. For example, they warned that some Americans with health insurance could overpay if they use the site. But people without insurance may find lower prices on Trump RX than if they walked into a pharmacy. And today in the Middle East, some of President Trump's top advisers are set to hold talks with Iran as Trump has turned up pressure on the country. Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, along with Steve Wickoff, Trump's special envoy, will meet facetoface with Iran's foreign minister in Oman. Trump has recently moved warships into the region and has [music] threatened to strike Iran unless it agrees to a number of his demands. That includes freezing its nuclear program, reducing its stockpile of ballistic missiles, and ending support for militant groups. Middle Eastern diplomats tell the Times they want the Americans to focus just on Iran's nuclear program. They're worried that the other demands could doom the talks before they even get started. Venezuelan oil is pretty different compared to oil drilled in the United States. It's dirtier, heavier. It contains a lot more sulfur, and that makes it trickier to process. Heroko Tbuchi covers the environment and pollution for the Times. She's been reporting on how the Trump administration's plans for Venezuela and its oil have set off alarm bells in one small American town. It sits on the Gulf Coast and it has a massive specialized Chevron refinery. It's one of the few places in the country that can process the specific kind of oil that comes from Venezuela. Heroko says that since the administration has moved to boost Venezuelan oil exports, residents there are bracing for what that could mean for them. >> Some of the people here in Pasigula, Mississippi worry that the air pollution they were already dealing with could get a lot worse. Everyone who owned a house back here had some form of cancer. >> When I spoke to residents in Pasigula, they told me it felt like health problems had touched almost every family in the neighborhood. >> Sinus, running nose, and just it was constant headaches and skin irritation. I have that now. I just start itching and just it wouldn't stop. One resident told Heroko that sometimes the air smells like quote acid strong enough to take your breath. And Chevron's own monitors show occasional spikes in benzene, a carcinogen. Now, with the possibility that more Venezuelan oil could start being processed next door, some people there are doubling down on demands for Chevron to buy out their houses and pay for them to move elsewhere. One resident of 30 years said she didn't mind the oil giant operating there, but said quote, "Just get us all out." For its part, Chevron says it has safely processed Venezuelan style oil for decades. It's been non-committal about the residents buyout requests, but said that it's open to ways to quote collaborate with the community. A company spokesman told the Times, "Our employees live in Pasigoula, too."

### 韩流文化驱动语言学习新浪潮

近年来，美国民众对韩国流行文化的兴趣持续增长，无论是现象级的剧集如《**鱿鱼游戏**》（Squid Game），还是风靡全球的K-pop音乐，都显示出这种文化影响力的扩大。这种日益增长的文化吸引力正转化为更多美国人学习韩语的意愿。从加利福尼亚州到阿肯色州，多所大学正在扩展其韩语和韩国文化课程。语言学习应用**Duolingo**报告称，去年在美国学习韩语的用户增长了22%。一位教授高中生韩语课程的老师表示，许多没有韩国血统的学生在入学时已掌握了基础的韩语短语和俚语。

学习韩语的入门过程可能看似容易，其书写系统（谚文，Hangul）被认为是世界上最合乎逻辑的系统之一，仅需几个小时即可掌握字母。然而，根据美国国务院的评估，韩语对英语母语者来说是一种学习难度较高的语言。

[music] And finally, Americans interest in Korean pop culture has been building for years. Whether it's Squid Game, >> K-pop, they're stealing the souls of our fans, >> K-pop demon hunters, and now that obsession is translating into more and more Americans wanting to learn Korean. >> And in the song Golden by Hunrix, you hear these Korean expressions. [music] In the darkened path ahead, >> universities from California to Arkansas are expanding their courses in Korean language and culture. Duolingo, the language learning app, saw a 22% growth in Korean learners in the US last year. And one teacher who leads Korean classes for high schoolers said many of his students who have no Korean heritage are already coming in knowing basic phrases and slang. Getting started in Korean may seem easy at first. The writing system is regarded as one of the most logical in the world. It can take just a few hours to learn the alphabet. Speaking Korean, though [music] going to be a little tougher. According to the State Department, it is one of the most difficult languages for English speakers to pick up. [music]
