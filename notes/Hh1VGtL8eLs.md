summary: 本期市场分析深入探讨了多个关键动态：Nebius公布了超预期的强劲财报，并宣布与Meta达成30亿美元的新协议，推动其股价备受关注。软银出售了价值58亿美元的英伟达股份，此举并非看空，而是为了将资金重新部署到OpenAI和ARM等其他高增长AI项目中。SoFi作为首家全国性银行，正式重启加密货币交易平台，其CEO详细阐述了此举的战略意义。此外，Grab与GoTo的合并传闻愈演愈烈，可能重塑东南亚市场格局。宏观方面，政府停摆即将结束，但疲软的ADP就业数据引发了对劳动力市场的担忧。

title: 软银抛售英伟达，Nebius财报亮眼，SoFi重启加密货币业务

### 市场开盘概览：盘前回调与宏观动态

大家早上好，欢迎回到新一期的市场开盘直播。今天是11月11日，星期二，上午8:46。感谢大家的到来。今天我们有很多内容要谈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. It is Tuesday, November 11th, 8:46 a.m. We are live. Thank you everybody for being here. Uh we've got a lot to talk about today.</p>
</details>

今天早上有 Nebius 的财报，坦率地说，Nebius 的表现非常出色。所以我们会多聊聊 Nebius 的情况。政府停摆即将结束，这非常重要。参议院已经正式通过了程序性投票，现在法案将提交给众议院进行表决。希望今天晚些时候我们能得到一些关于停摆结束以及政府可能正式重新开放的最新消息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We had Nebius earnings this morning which quite frankly Nebas crushed it. So we'll talk a little bit more about what we got going on with Nebius. We got the shutdown coming to an end which is very important. The Senate officially passed their procedural vote. It now goes to the House as that gets voted on. Hopefully later today we're going to get some updates in terms of this shutdown coming to an end and potentially the government officially reopening.</p>
</details>

我们还有一堆宏观经济方面的事情要谈。随着政府准备重新开放，我们开始获得更多数据，特别是关于 **ADP**（Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: 美国自动数据处理公司，提供人力资源管理软件和服务，其发布的私营部门就业报告是重要的经济指标）的私营部门就业数据。所以我们会讨论一下。昨天我们也得到了一些重要的宏观数据，需要进行剖析，然后我们会继续。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh you got a bunch of different macro stuff to talk about. We are getting a little bit more data now that the government is getting ready to be open particularly around ADP private payroll. So we'll talk about that. We did get a couple of pieces of macro data yesterday that will be important to dissect uh and we will go from there.</p>
</details>

今天早上软银出售了他们持有的英伟达股份，这相当疯狂，价值58亿美元。关于软银的故事是，如果他们当初没有卖掉2019年持有的头寸，现在这些股份将价值2500亿美元。孙正义显然在 OpenAI、ARM 以及其他一些公司（比如可能还有 Marvell）中看到了更多机会。上周有传言说软银想将 Marvell 私有化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">SoftBank sold their Nvidia stake this morning which is pretty crazy. Uh $5.8 billion stake. The story with SoftBank is if they held on to their position that they sold in 2019 they would have a $250 billion stake. Masasan obviously seeing more opportunities in OpenAI ARM and some of these other companies potentially Marvel. There was a rumor last week Soft Bank wants to take them private.</p>
</details>

所以，他们确实退出了在英伟达的持股，并表示这并非因为对英伟达缺乏信心，只是因为市场上有更好的机会。我们会讨论并分析这件事，看看它可能带来的影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, um you do have them exiting their Nvidia stake and they said it wasn't really about their conviction in Nvidia. It was just better opportunities that are out there. So, we'll talk about that, analyze it, and we'll kind of see the implications of it as well.</p>
</details>

然后，我们看到盘前市场是红色的。在我看来，盘前市场的下跌并非基于任何特定的新闻头条。我注意到昨天东部时间午夜12点左右，当期货市场转为下跌时，盘前市场也跟着变红了。我认为这只是因为昨天市场表现太疯狂了。英伟达经历了自四月以来最好的一天，单日上涨了6%。这种情况自四月以来从未发生过。所以看到英伟达获得如此强劲的势头，确实令人难以置信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and then we have a red premarket. Now, the red premarket, in my opinion, is not based on any specific headline. Uh and I kind of saw it went red when the futures flipped red yesterday at around 12 a.m. Eastern. I think it's just because we had a crazy day yesterday. We had the best day since April for Nvidia. Nvidia was up 6% in a day. That hasn't happened since April. So quite incredible to see Nvidia get that type of momentum.</p>
</details>

更广泛的标普500指数上涨了1.5%。说实话，在这样的一天之后，市场稍作喘息是正常的。标普500指数目前在679点，下跌了约0.25%。所以我们要看看开盘后抛售是否会加剧。盘前市场的抛售并不算严重，但我确实认为这是在消化昨天的一些涨幅。这就是盘前市场的一些情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The broader S&P 500 was up one and a half percent. I mean it is normal for the market to take a little bit of a breather on a day like this. 679 on the S&P down about 0.25%. So we'll see when the market opens if this selloff intensifies. Not really that much of a selloff in the pre-market, but nonetheless, I do think it's consolidating some of the gains that we are getting from yesterday. And that's some of the stuff we got going on in the pre-markets.</p>
</details>

首先，在我们开始之前，今天是美国的退伍军人节。所以，我想对所有为我们国家服役过的人说一声退伍军人节快乐。随着年龄的增长，我越来越意识到美国是多么特别，以及我自己和许多美国人是多么理所当然地享受着自由。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">First of all, before we get started, it is Veterans Day in the United States. So, want to wish a happy Veterans Day to anyone who has served uh for our country. Uh it is, you know, one of those things where as I've gotten older, I've started to realize just how special America is and how much myself and so many Americans take freedom for granted.</p>
</details>

当你年纪渐长，你会开始反思，你为社会贡献了什么？除了纳税，我从未保卫过我的国家，也从未为国家冒过生命危险。这是一种极其、极其光荣的行为，我非常感谢那些曾在美国陆军、军队、海军、空军服役的人。如果你曾为这个国家冒生命危险，我对此深表感激。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And uh, you know, as you get older, you start to recognize, you know, what have you contributed to society? And outside of paying taxes, I've never defended my country or put my life on the line for my country. It is an incredibly incredibly uh honorable thing to do and very very grateful to those who have served in the US Army, military, navy, air force. If you've you know put your life on the line for this country, I am deeply appreciative of that.</p>
</details>

话虽如此，退伍军人节意味着债券市场休市，而股票市场开市。所以，鉴于信贷市场今天关闭，许多银行也关门，你可能不会看到像昨天那么大的交易量。这也有可能影响股市的一些行为。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh having said that, Veterans Day means that uh the bond market is closed and the stock market is open. So you might not see as much volume given credit markets are going to be closed today and a lot of different banks are closed today. So we will see a market open. We just might not see the type of volume we saw yesterday. And that could also potentially influence some of the behavior um in the stock market as well.</p>
</details>

是的，对于聊天室里所有的退伍军人，谢谢你们。谢谢，谢谢，谢谢你们的服务。一句“谢谢”是远远不够的，但这是我们在这样一天至少能说的话。我深表感激，谢谢你们。我年纪越大，就越意识到，我能在这个国家开发的像 YouTube 这样的平台上自由发言，唯一的原因就是我们有言论自由。而我们拥有言论自由的原因之一，是有人为了保护这种言论自由而战斗和牺牲。因此，我深深地感谢那些为我们国家服务过的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, for all the vets in the chat, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your service. I mean, there's thank you is not enough to say, but uh it's the least we could say on a day like this. So deeply, deeply appreciative and thank you. The older I get, the more I realize how important it is to not forget that the only reason I'm able to talk freely on a platform like YouTube that was developed in this country is because we have free speech. But one of the reasons we have free speech is because people fought and died to protect that speech. So deeply deeply appreciative to those who served our country.</p>
</details>

### Nebius 财报强劲，新获 Meta 大单

好了，让我们进入正题。我们先从 Nebius 开始。首先，让我为那些40分钟前刚看到我推文的人说明一下情况。我40分钟前发推文的原因是，我在40分钟前做了一件事，那就是我买了 Nebius。我入场了。我正式入场了。Nate 现在可以不用每天给我发短信了。我正式入场了。我买了这只股票。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, let's get into it. Uh Nebius, let's start off with this. Well, first off, let me say the uh the obvious for those that just saw my tweet that I posted 40 minutes ago. And the reason I posted it 40 minutes ago is because I did something 40 minutes ago, which is I bought Nabius. I'm in. I am in officially. Nate can stop texting me every day now. I am officially in. I'm in the stock.</p>
</details>

看，那份财报真的非常不错。坦白说，我都忘了 Nebius 今天早上有财报。我醒来，看了看手机，看到了那些数字，然后我看到股票是红的。我就想，等一下，这些数字看起来太好了，股票不应该是红的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm in the Nate. Look, those earnings were pretty damn good. Quite frankly, I forgot Nebas had earnings this morning. I woke up, I looked at my phone, I saw the numbers, then I saw the stock. It was red. I'm like, wait a second. These numbers look too good for this stock to be read.</p>
</details>

营收1.46亿美元。调整后的 **EBITDA** (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization: 税息折旧及摊销前利润) 超出预期。他们的目标是到2026年实现70到90亿美元的 **ARR** (Annual Recurring Revenue: 年度经常性收入)。这意味着，以目前的估值来看，该股票的市销率目标是3倍。从这个角度看，它相当便宜。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Revenue of 146 million. Adjusted EBIDA beat expectations. They are targeting 7 to9 billion of ARR in 2026. That means the stock at this valuation is trying to get three times revenue. It's pretty damn cheap from that perspective.</p>
</details>

当你考虑到利润率状况在进入2026年时会扩大或出现拐点，因为他们持续提升在这种营收增长下实现盈利的能力。他们2026年的合同电力从1吉瓦增加到了2.5吉瓦。到2025年底，他们原计划是220兆瓦，现在他们的目标是到2026年底达到800兆瓦到1吉瓦。这不仅仅是合同电力，而是已连接电力，这才是真正让他们能够扩展数据中心业务的关键。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When you also think of the margin profile extending or inflecting going into 2026 as they continue to increase the ability for them to actually make a profit on this type of revenue growth. Their contracted power for 2026 went from 1 gawatt to 2.5 gawatts. And in the end of 2025, they were scheduled for 220 megawws. They are now targeting 800 to one gawatt by the end of 2026. Not just contracted power, but connected power, which is like actually what allows them to be able to scale their data center operations.</p>
</details>

从新闻稿和 Nebius 联合创始人 Roman 在 Twitter 上的发言来看，最重要的一点是：“我们卖光了所有存货，而且我们将建造更多。”换句话说，对他们来说，这不是一个需求问题，这也是我们看到的这些**新型云服务商**（Neoclouds: 指的是新兴的、专注于特定领域或技术的云服务提供商，通常与AWS、Azure等传统巨头形成差异化竞争）的一个趋势。这更像是一个“嘿，我们有什么就给市场什么，并且得到了回报，但如果我们有更多，我们本可以提供更多”的问题。这让我想起亚马逊谈论 AWS 计算能力时的情况，他们只是需要更多的数据中心容量才能销售更多的 AWS 服务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the biggest things from the press release and from what Roman said on Twitter, um, who is the co-founder of Nebus, is that we sold all we had and we're going to build much more. aka this was not a demand problem for them which is what we're seeing as as a trend for these neoclouds. This was more so a question of hey whatever we had we gave to the market and we got you know compensated for that but if we had more we would have even given more reminds me of kind of how Amazon was talking about AWS compute and how they just need more data center capacity to be able to even sell more of AWS.</p>
</details>

所以，他们卖光了所有可用容量，调整后EBITDA利润率为19%，集团营收同比增长355%，并且截至2025年9月，他们还通过可转换票据和股权发行获得了约43亿美元的资金。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So they sold out of all their available capacity 19% adjusted EIA margins 355% year-over-year group revenue growth and they've also secured about 4.3 billion in convertible notes in an equity offering as of September 2025.</p>
</details>

我最终对 Nebius 抄底感到兴奋的另一个原因是。记住，我在这只股票130美元的时候对它做过深入研究。所以很明显，我对它产生了兴趣。但我在大约一周前发布的 Substack 文章中说我不想买入的原因之一，首先是当时股价在130美元，我想要一个更好的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now the other reason I was really excited to finally buy the dip on Nebas. Remember I did a deep dive on the stock when it was at 130. So obviously I was getting interested in it but uh one of the reasons I said I didn't want to buy it in my Substack when I published it about a week ago. First of all the stock was at 130. Kind of wanted a better opportunity.</p>
</details>

其次，我有点困惑，他们是否真的能让更多的**超大规模云服务商**（Hyperscalers: 指的是像亚马逊AWS、微软Azure和谷歌云这样拥有巨大规模和全球基础设施的顶级云服务提供商）签约他们的业务。他们真的能再拿到一个像微软那样的交易吗？嗯，他们拿到了 Meta。今天他们和 Meta 达成了一项交易。一份为期五年、价值30亿美元的协议。这虽然没有微软的交易那么大，但对我来说，也许这只是我之前的一个挑剔之处，我想知道，这到底是不是真的？他们真的能拿到更多交易，还是只是在承诺交易并说“嘿，我们会拿到更多超大规模云服务商的合同”，但永远不会兑现？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, second of all is like I was just kind of confused about can they actually get more of these hyperscalers to um, you know, sign on to their business. Can they actually get another Microsoft type of deal? Well, they got Meta. They got Meta today. $3 billion deal over five years with Meta. It's not as big as the Microsoft deal, but for me, and maybe it was just like a nitpicky thing I had, I wanted to know, is this legit? Can they actually get more deals or are they just promising deals and saying, "Hey, we're going to get more hyperscalers, but it's never going to come through."</p>
</details>

根据我今天看到的情况，他们确实在获得更多交易。而且看起来，考虑到他们现有的以及到2026年将要建设的容量，他们似乎会获得更多。从这个角度来看，当你的估值是2026年远期指引的三倍，当你以他们那样的水平提高指引，当你财报超预期，最重要的是，当他们实际上在建立一个更全面的数据中心视野时——因为 Nebius 还有很多其他业务，比如这个新的代币工厂，我还不完全了解其所有影响，但这与他们的数据中心整体业务非常协同，更不用说他们还在支持 ClickHouse——这个投资论点有很多部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Based on what I saw today, they are getting more deals. And it looks like given the capacity that they have and how they're building that capacity going into 2026, it looks like they're going to get a lot more. It looks like they're going to get a lot more. So from that perspective, I mean, when you're trading at three times 2026 forward guidance, when you're raising guidance at the level that they're raising, when you're beating on earnings, and most importantly, when they're actually establishing a more holistic view of data centers, because there's a lot of other things that go into Nebius, like this new token factory, which I don't know exactly all the different implications of it, but that is very suh synergistic with what they're doing with the overall data center offering, not to mention they're staking Click House. I mean, there's a lot of parts of the thesis.</p>
</details>

我理解 Nebius，可以说比过去理解得更好了。自从我做了深入研究后，我只是觉得在股价130美元，经历了那么大的涨幅之后，不值得跳进去。今天在盘前市场看到它在财报后下跌，我没有在看到它下跌时立即买入，但我看着财报，看着股票，我就想，等一下。好吧，也许这是一个更好的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Again, I'll link my deep dive for those that want to read it. So, I've understood Nebius, I would say, better than I have in the past. Ever since I've done the deep dive, I just, you know, didn't feel at 130 after that big of a run, it was worth the the opportunity to jump in. Seeing it red in the pre-market today after those earnings. I mean, I didn't buy immediately when I saw it was red, but then I'm looking at the earnings and I'm looking at the stock and I'm just like, wait a second. Okay, maybe this is a maybe this is like some better of an opportunity.</p>
</details>

为什么今天股价会下跌？可能有很多原因。也许是更多的稀释，也许是整个市场都在下跌。原因可能多种多样，但那份财报不应该是股价下跌的原因。就像 Robin Hood 财报后跌到120美元一样，那也毫无道理。但我理解 Robin Hood，所以我能自信地说那毫无道理。对于那些了解 Nebius 的人，你可能也能自信地说这毫无道理。对我来说，我需要做更多的研究。最后，我得出结论，这可能确实毫无道理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And why is the stock down today? There could be a bunch of reasons. Maybe some more dilution. Maybe the entire market's red. I mean, there could be a variety of reasons, but those earnings should not be a reason why the stock is red. Same thing with Robin Hood falling to 120 after earnings. Like, that made no sense. But I understood Robin Hood, which is why I could confidently say that made no sense. For those that understand Nebius, you probably could confidently say that makes no sense. For me, I need to do a little bit more digging. At the end, I concluded um it probably makes no sense.</p>
</details>

所以我入场了。我认为这是一个非常棒的季度。我现在是这个旅程的一部分了。我会努力对 Nebius 做更多的研究。显然，我没有建立完整的头寸。所以，我会寻找更多的下跌机会买入，并观察故事如何发展。但这只股票上周还在130美元，然后跌到104美元，又回到了130美元。所以我认为，如果人们持有这只股票，就必须为它的波动性做好准备。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I'm in. I thought it was an incredible quarter. I am now part of of this journey. I will try to do a lot more research on Nebius. Did not obviously establish a full position. So, I'll be looking to buy on more dips and seeing kind of how the story plays out. But this stock was at 130 last week, then it fell to 104, then it went back to 130. So, I do think the volatility in the stock is something people do have to be prepared for if they're in it.</p>
</details>

我对于更广泛的“新云”投资主题仍然没有完全、完全、完全地兴奋。我对此的看法一直很透明，我只是认为英伟达以及持有它的敞口可能是投资整个数据中心领域的最佳方式。然而，我喜欢增长，当你看到这种类型的增长和合同类型时——顺便说一下，他们还拿下了 Cursor，这是增长最快的初创公司之一，ARR 达到1亿美元，它是一个 AI 编码助手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I am still not fully fully fully excited about the broader neo cloud thesis. I've been pretty transparent on my thoughts there that I just think Nvidia and having exposure to that might be the best way to play the overall data center space. However, I like growth and when you see this type of growth and you see the types of contracts again, they also got cursor which is one of the fastest growing startups to uh 100 million ARR, which is an AI coding assistant.</p>
</details>

当你看到这种增长，以及能够驾驭这种增长的管理层时，顺便说一句，我还要说的是，我非常喜欢他们的管理层。我一直在做更多的尽职调查。我没有把这个写在 Substack 上，但对 Roman 和他的团队做了更多的尽职调查，只是想了解，我能把我的资金托付给这些人吗？我觉得我比信任 Coreweave 的 CEO 更能信任他们。Coreweave 的财报不错，但今天该股被全面下调评级，下跌了8.5%。我们会更多地讨论它，但关键是他们正在增加债务负担，而华尔街对此并不满意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh when you see that type of growth and you see the type of management that's being able to steward that growth, by the way, the other thing I'll say is I really like management. I've been doing a little bit more due diligence. I didn't put this on the substack, but doing a little bit more due diligence on Roman and the team and just trying to understand, can I trust these guys with my capital? I feel like I could trust these guys a lot more than the Cororeweave CEO, which look, Cororeweave had a good earnings. That stock got downgraded across the board today, down 8.5%. Uh we'll talk more about it, but kind of the key story is that they're increasing their debt load and the street's not happy about that.</p>
</details>

但听 Roman 在电话会议上的发言，再对比 Coreweave 的那位，感觉就是有点不一样。更不用说 Nebius 的估值感觉比 Coreweave 有吸引力得多，特别是因为他们没有同样类型的债务状况。所以这就是我投资 Nebius 的原因。这就是我们的情况，我会做更多的尽职调查，并给大家带来更多关于这方面的研究，但我已经入场了。我们称之为一个初始仓位。可以看作是“嘿，股票在好财报后下跌了”，我们会看看它是否会随着时间的推移继续发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But just listening to Roman on the call versus the Core guy, I just feels like there's a little bit of a difference. Not to mention the valuation on Nebus feels way more attractive than on Core, especially because they just don't have the same type of debt profile. So that's why I'm in Nebus and um that's what we got and I will do a lot more due diligence and give you guys more research on this but I'm in it's let's call it a starter position. Let's call it hey stocks red after good earnings and we'll see if it continues to develop over time and that's what we got on Nebus.</p>
</details>

我知道这对于 INE 和所有其他股票有很多不同的影响。我还没有对比特币挖矿和高性能计算设施进行过非常深入的研究。我想说的是，根据我对 Nebius 的分析，拥有一个更多元化的参与者是件好事，这个参与者不是曾经的比特币矿工，然后转型，因为这样会有一个更全面的产品。这并不是说比特币矿工不好，只是我认为像 Nebius 这样的公司有不同类型的护城河。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now I know there's a lot of different implications of what does this mean for INE and all these other stocks. Again I have not done super big deep dives on the Bitcoin mining HPC facilities. I will say at its core from the analysis I've done on Nebius, it is just nice to have a more diversified player that didn't uh that wasn't a Bitcoin miner at one point and then transition because there's just a little bit more of a holistic offering. Not to say the Bitcoin miners are bad. Just to say that I think there's a different type of moat that a company like Nebus has.</p>
</details>

但话说回来，投资这个领域的重点在于，如果你在20美元时买入 IN，我不认为它会回到20美元。现在它在60美元。他们只租出了大约12%的容量，还有88%可以提供给市场。我认为这些公司正在进入许多不同的垂直领域。我只是想选择一个我认为估值合理且增长合理的公司。根据我在财报中看到的情况，我认为 Nebius 就是这样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But again, the whole point of investing in the space is that if you're an IN from 20, I don't think it's going back to 20. You know, now it's at 60. Like they've only leased out about 12% of their capacity. they have another 88% left that they can give out to the markets. And there's a lot of different verticals that I think these companies are going into. I just wanted to pick a name that I thought had a reasonable valuation and was putting up reasonable growth. And based on what I saw in earnings, I think that's what we got on Nebas.</p>
</details>

所以，就是这样。Nebius 的财报非常出色。恭喜这里的每一个人。我知道股票没有非常非常大的涨幅。它上涨了4%，这很好。也许市场一开盘它就会下跌4%，但我确实认为这是一个值得至少入场的季度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there you go. Nebas crushed earnings. Congrats to everyone here. I know the stock's not super super pumping. It is up 4% which is nice. Maybe it goes down 4% as soon as the market opens, but I do think it was a quarter that was worth at least getting into. That's what we got on NBS.</p>
</details>

### 个人投资动向：建仓 Meta

昨天我还做了几笔买入，然后我们会谈谈 SoFi 以及英伟达和软银的其他一些新闻。我昨天买了 Meta，朋友们。我买了 Meta。那么，我为什么买 Meta 呢？简单说一下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Made a couple other buys yesterday and then we'll get into SoFi and some of these other headlines with Nvidia and um and SoftBank. Uh I bought Meta yesterday, folks. I bought Meta. So, why did I buy Meta? Quick TLDDR.</p>
</details>

我买 Meta 的原因很简单。我认为我不会在 Meta 上得到我想要的最佳价格。有几点。我知道上周我们谈到我那个做多 Meta 的朋友，他基本上说：“嘿，你可能要等一下再逢低买入，因为扎克伯格在资本支出上的花费显然不会被华尔街很好地解读。”我认为他说的没错。

<details>

<p class="english-text">The reason I bought Meta, very simple. Uh I don't think I'm going to get the best price that I want on Meta. So, couple things. I know last week we talked about my friend who's long meta and basically said, "Hey, you might want to wait a little bit before you sort of nibble at the dip because obviously the Zuck spending on capex is not going to be um interpreted well by the street." I think he's right about that.</p>
</details>

坦白说，我认为我们可能会有更好的下跌机会。我昨晚在632美元买的。但后来我仔细研究了数字后开始问自己，好吧，他可能说得对，扎克伯格在资本支出上花钱不计后果，而且没有投资回报计划。他也可能说得对，等待并从管理层那里获得一些关于2026年第一季度发展轨迹的尽职调查是合适的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And quite frankly, I think we might get an even better dip. I bought at 632 last night. But then I started asking myself after going through the numbers, okay, he's probably right that Zup is spending carelessly on capex and there's no plan for the ROI. He's also probably right that waiting and getting some, you know, due diligence from the management on terms of where the trajectory is going going into Q1 of 2026 would be like appropriate to do.</p>
</details>

但是，第一，我们正处于牛市。第二，利率正在下降。第三，Meta 已经从高点下跌了15%。对于一支**七巨头**（MAG 7: 指的是微软、苹果、谷歌、亚马逊、英伟达、特斯拉和Meta这七家科技巨头）股票来说，从高点下跌30%是可能的，但这需要一个巨大的叙事重估。我不知道这是否会发生。我认为它可能会发生，如果真的发生，我会更兴奋地在600美元以下买入 Meta。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But A, we're in a bull market. B, rates are coming down. C, Meta's already down 15% from the highs. For a MAG 7 to go down what, 30% from the highs, it's possible, but there's got to be a massive narrative rerating. And I don't know if that's going to take place. Like I I think it could take place. And if it does take place, I would be a lot more excited to buy Meta anywhere below 600.</p>
</details>

但如果它不发生呢，顺便说一句，上周五世界末日般的时候，Meta 就在600美元。所以，我们上一次看到 Meta 跌到这种程度，是整个市场都在大跌的时候，然后市场反弹了，现在 Meta 又回到了630美元。所以，盘前市场是624美元。我确实认为值得设置一个**定期定额投资法**（DCA, Dollar-Cost Averaging: 一种投资策略，无论市场价格如何，都定期投资固定金额的资金）。我不会在630美元买入你所有想买的 Meta，但我认为从630美元开始并不疯狂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But if it doesn't, by the way, Meta was at 600 on freaking Friday when the world was collapsing. So, the last time we got Meta to actually go down to such an extent was when the entire market was taking a dump and then the market rebounded and now Meta is back to 630. So, 624 in the pre-markets. I do think it's worth setting up a DCA. You know, I I wouldn't buy everything that you wanted to buy of MET at 630, but I think starting at 630 is not crazy.</p>
</details>

因为在某个时候，如果它跌破600美元，那就太好了。那是一个抄底的机会，我认为那才是真正的世代机会。如果不是，那就好像，你难道要等到它跌到500美元吗？也许那会发生，但如果它不发生，那么你就是在错过一家市盈率仅为19倍的公司，它是世界上最重要的广告公司之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because at some point if it gets below 600, great. That's a buy the dip. That's when I think it really becomes a generational opportunity. If not, it's like, are you gonna wait until it gets to 500? And maybe that happens, but if it doesn't, then you're, you know, fading a company trading at 19 times forward earnings, which is one of the most important advertising companies in the world.</p>
</details>

所以，我们拭目以待。也许现在买入为时过早。如果不是，那么，这可能是一个很好的抄底机会。但我确实认为，随着我们接近年底，事情开始明朗化，我不确定 Meta 是否会给我们那个跌到570美元区间的轻松机会。也许在2026年，如果整个市场回调，但现在，我认为可能更难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, look, we'll see what happens. Maybe this is too early. If not, then, uh, you know, maybe this is a good dip buying opportunity. But I do think as we get towards the end of the year and things start to shape up, I don't know if Meta gives us that easy opportunity down into the 570s. Maybe in 2026 if the entire market corrects, but right now, I think it might be harder.</p>
</details>

是的，Meta 的首席 AI 科学家正在辞职。我有点不讨厌这件事，据我所知，这家伙真的很烦人，被很多 AI 社区的人当成了一个笑话。而且他们在五个月前收购 Alexander Wang 的公司时，基本上已经用他取代了 Yann LeCun。Yann LeCun 本来应该是核心人物，然后 Alexander Wang 成了核心人物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, the Meta chief AI scientist is stepping down. Uh I kind of don't hate that this guy was like really annoying from from what I understand and he was treated as a meme by a lot of the AI community. They also basically replaced him with Alexander Wang when they bought out his company five months ago. Like like Yan Yan Lun was supposed to be like the core guy and then Alexander Wang became the core guy.</p>
</details>

我仍然对 Meta 和 AI 到底在搞什么鬼感到担忧。我不知道他们为什么花这么多钱。我不知道他们为什么给 Scale AI 150亿美元。那感觉像是在浪费钱。坦白说，Scale AI 有很多竞争对手，他们的收入比它高得多。我不知道 Alexander Wang 是不是市场上最大的 AI 人物，如果他们真的为他支付了150亿美元的话。所以我有所顾虑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I still have my concerns on what the hell is going on with meta and AI. Like I don't know why they're spending all this money. I don't know why the hell they gave 15 billion dollars to scale AI. That feels like a waste of money. Quite really there's a lot of competitors to scale AI that are doing way more revenue than I don't know if Alexander Wang is the biggest AI name in the market if they did pay 15 billion for him. So I have my concerns.</p>
</details>

但然后你看看 Instagram Reels 一年能赚500亿美元，就会觉得，好吧，它在三年半的时间里从零增长到了500亿。所以，真的很难和扎克伯格对着干。真的很难。所以即使有这些担忧，我认为也值得在下跌时抓住机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But then you look at Instagram reels doing $50 billion a year and it's like okay it went from zero to 50 billion in three and a half years. It's like all right. So like it's really hard to bet against sucks. It just really is. And so even with those concerns, I think it's worth taking a an opportunity on the dip. So that's what we got with Meta.</p>
</details>

这就是 Meta 和 Nebius 的情况。投资组合中的新头寸。我是在659美元买的，所以你可以说我是在做 DCA。Nebius 是正式的新头寸。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And uh that's what we got with Nebius. New positions in the portfol, but you know, I bought at 659, so I guess you can say at DC8, Nebius is officially in new position.</p>

### 软银出售英伟达股份，加码其他 AI 投资

软银和英伟达。好的，我们来谈谈这个新闻。我不认为这是什么大事，但它确实是今天早上的一个新闻头条。软银以58.3亿美元的价格出售了其在英伟达的全部股份。再说一次，如果软银在2019年没有出售他们最初持有的头寸，或者至少是其中的一大部分，他们现在在英伟达的股份将价值2500亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um SoftBank and Nvidia. Okay, so let's talk about this news. I don't think this is that big of a deal, but nonetheless, it is a headline that is crossing over the news this morning. Soft Bank sold their entire stake in Nvidia for 5.83 billion. Again, SoftBank, if they held on to Nvidia back in um in 2019 when they sold the original position that they had, or at least a good chunk of it, they would have had a $250 billion stake in Nvidia.</p>
</details>

我认为这让孙正义很恼火。但不管怎样，他们需要钱来资助所有其他的赌注，他们必须从某个地方弄到钱。英伟达，你知道，总有一天会比现在更值钱。但是，也许它会成为一家10万亿美元的公司。好吧。孙正义会为了翻倍而持有吗？可能不会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I think that annoys um that annoys Masasan a lot. But nonetheless, like money to fund all their other bets and they got to get the money from somewhere. Uh Nvidia, you know, probably one day is going to be worth more than what it is today. But, you know, maybe it's a $10 trillion company. Okay. Is Masan going to hold for a double? Probably not.</p>
</details>

所以我实际上认为，从逻辑上讲，他们出售股份是合理的。只是如果他们从2019年就一直持有，他们的股份会更有价值。所以我认为他们觉得，如果能把这笔钱投入到其他可以以更激进的方式复利增长的东西上，那将是目前更好的资本利用方式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I actually think logically it makes sense for them to sell the stake. It's just if they held on from 2019, you know, they would have had a better stake. And so I think they think if they can put this money into something else that could compound in a much more aggressive way that'd be a better use of that capital at the moment</p>
</details>

关于 AI 估值，他们担心软银在英伟达之后实际出售股份是不是一个坏兆头，这是一个大问题。孙正义决定在此时卖掉他所有在英伟达的股份，并拿走他从这笔股份中赚到的58亿美元。我们几分钟前刚从东京的公司电话会议上得知，首席财务官表示，事实并非如此。这并不是因为他们对英伟达或其增长前景有任何疑问。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> about AI valuations and they worry is it a bad sign that Soft Bank are actually selling after Nvidia stake >> that's a big question here. Yeah Masoshi Sun decided that he's going to sell off all of his uh shareholdings in Nvidia at this point and and take the $5.8 billion that he made from that stake. Now, we just got the conference call from the company in Tokyo just a few minutes ago. And there, the CFO said that that's actually not the case. It's not because they have any uh questions about Nvidia or Nvidia's growth prospects.</p>
</details>

相反，他们真正需要的是用这笔钱来进行自己的投资。他们想在许多不同领域投资人工智能。当然，他们在美国是 OpenAI 的合作伙伴，参与了 Stargate 项目，计划投资1000亿，甚至可能5000亿美元。我们还听说过在亚利桑那州建立制造设施的计划，他们想在那里再投资数千亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Instead, what they really need is they need that money to be able to make their own investments. They want to invest in AI in a number of different areas. They're partners with Open AI, of course, in the United States with his Stargate venture where they plan on investing a hundred billion, maybe $500 billion. We've also heard plans about an Arizona manufacturing uh facility where they want to invest hundreds more billion dollars. So</p>
</details>

所以他们需要钱。他们需要钱投入到不同的地方，而且看起来他们越来越倾向于投资这些数据中心基础设施。说到数据中心，再次为 Iran、Nebius 和所有这些公司提供看涨理由。微软今天表示，他们将在葡萄牙投资100亿美元用于 AI 基础设施的数据中心。谷歌今天也表示，他们将在德国投资58.8亿美元用于数据中心和基础设施。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So they need the money. They need the money to put into different places and it looks like they're getting more into these data center infrastructure investments. Speaking of data centers and get again going for the bullcase for Iran, Nebius, all those companies. Microsoft today said they're going to do 10 billion of data center investments for AI infrastructure in Portugal. And Google today said they're going to do 5.8 8 billion of data center and infrastructure investments in Germany.</p>
</details>

你一次又一次地看到，我知道上周我们在这个所谓的 AI 资本支出交易上遇到了一点小挫折，Oracle 现在回到了九月份的水平。我认为持怀疑态度是公平的。昨天 Michael Burry 基本上说一切都是泡沫，并预计11月25日会有大事发生。我不知道他会推出什么，是一本书，还是更多的分析，或者我们会看到什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean over and over again you're seeing I know we had a little bit of a hiccup last week on this sort of AI capex trade and Oracle is now back to levels that it was at in September. And I think it's fair to be skeptical. We had Michael Bur yesterday basically say everything's a bubble and expect something big on November 25th. I don't know what he's coming out with if it's a book if it's more analysis or what we're going to see what it what happens.</p>
</details>

但 Michael Burry 担心的是资产折旧及其对夸大收益的影响，这些都是值得讨论的担忧。但从根本上说，你无法否认这些超大规模云服务商在数据中心上的投入金额，而这些超大规模云服务商将需要新型云服务商来帮助他们处理这些数据中心上的所有交易。我认为软银明白这一点，这就是为什么他们对投资这些数据中心感到兴奋。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But you know, Michael Bur is concerned about depreciating assets and what that means for overstating earnings and like those are all concerns that are worthwhile to discuss. At its core, you cannot deny the amount of investment that is going into these data centers from these hyperscalers and these hyperscalers are going to need the neoclouds to help them facilitate all the transactions on these data centers. I think SoftBank understands that and that's why they're getting excited to invest in these data centers.</p>
</details>

最重要的是，软银刚刚向 OpenAI 投入了350亿美元。他们需要从某个地方获得这笔钱，我知道他们正在通过举债来为对 OpenAI 的投资融资。这表明他们对 OpenAI 的成功非常有信心。但他们也需要流动性。所以，如果英伟达能涨到10万亿美元，那将是惊人的，但这需要时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On top of that, SoftBank just put in $35 billion into OpenAI. They need that money from somewhere and I know they're raising debt to be able to finance their investment in OpenAI. That's how confident they are that OpenAI is going to work out. But they also need like liquidity. And so I mean look again if Nvidia can go to 10 trillion that'd be amazing but it's going to take time for that to happen.</p>
</details>

问题是，如果 OpenAI 在同一时期内可能翻四倍，他们是否会为了翻倍而持有英伟达的股份。所以我不认为这是看跌的。我认为这只是他们必须做的事情。如果你管理着那么多钱，你可能也想通过同样的方式来操作并获利了结。但这就是我们关于软银的情况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the question is do they hold on to that stake for a double if OpenAI can potentially quadruple over the same time. And so I don't think it's bearish. I think it's just something they have to do. And if you are managing that much money, you know, you probably would want to navigate by doing the same thing and taking some profits. But that's what we got on Soft Bank.</p>
</details>

是的，AMD 今天下午1点也将举行一个大型分析师会议。我不会直播那个会议。我想 Jose 会直播，所以我们今天晚些时候会从 AMD 那里得到一些更新，然后我们会继续。

</details>

所以，Navius 的财报非常出色。我昨晚为自己抄底了 Meta。软银出售了他们的英伟达股份。再说一次，英伟达经历了自四月以来最好的一天之一，上涨了6%。这就是为什么我认为我们在盘前市场是正确的。老实说，我认为我们只是需要稍微喘口气，而英伟达就在那里稍作喘息，下跌了约2%。谷歌在盘前市场也下跌了约0.5%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, Navius earnings crushed it. Uh bought the dip on Meta last night for myself and SoftBank selling their Nvidia stake again. Nvidia having one of the best days they've had since April. 6% move on Nvidia. That's why I think we're right in the pre-markets. I think honestly we just need a little bit of a breather and you got Nvidia taking a bit of a breather right there down about 2%. Google as well that is down about half a percent in the pre-market.</p>

### 东南亚市场巨变：Grab 与 GoTo 合并传闻升级

好的，我们快速谈谈 Grab 的最新情况，然后再谈 SoFi。Grab 的故事变得越来越有趣了。我不想花太多时间在上面。我今晚晚些时候会在 Twitter 上发一个更长的帖子。我还在制作一个关于 Grab 财报更新的视频，可能会在明天发布。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, real quick let's talk Grab updates and then we'll get into SoFi. So the story is getting very very juicy on Grab. I don't want to spend too much time on it. I'll make a longer Twitter post later tonight. I'm also making a video on my Grab update on earnings that'll probably be out tomorrow.</p>
</details>

长话短说，昨天我们谈到了关于 Grab 和 GoTo 可能准备进行收购的传闻。一位来自印尼总统办公室的政府官员表示，他们希望 Grab 和 GoTo 合并。不是 GoTo 的金融科技部分，而是网约车和配送部分，这对利润率将非常有益，因为他们现在正处于价格战中，这就是为什么两家公司的利润率都很难看。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The TLDDR is that yesterday we talked about rumors about Grab and Goto potentially getting ready for an acquisition. There was a actual state official from the Indonesian president office saying that they want grab and go to merge. Not the go-to part of the fintech, not the fintech part of GoTo, but rather the uh ride hailing and delivery part, which would be very accretive to margins because right now they're in a price war, and that's why the margins kind of suck on both companies.</p>
</details>

显然，GoTo 并没有为股东带来很好的回报。Grab 开始为股东带来回报。Grab 在东南亚是一个更具主导地位的业务。昨晚10点，彭博社发布了一篇文章。说到软银，它在这两家公司中都持有股份，而且是相当重的股份，我想每家都接近10%。软银加入罢免 GoTo CEO 的行动，为 Grab 的交易铺平道路。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Obviously, Goto has not really returned well for shareholders. Grab is starting to return for shareholders. Grab is much more of a dominant business around Southeast Asia. Last night at 10 pm, Bloomberg comes out with a post. Speaking of SoftBank, which has a stake in both of these companies, a pretty heavy stake. I think it's almost 10% of each one. SoftBank joins Move to ou the go-to CEO, paving way for Grab Deal.</p>
</details>

这简直就像一部 Netflix 的剧集，展示了企业资本主义的残酷。几位 GoTo 的股东签署了一份备忘录给董事会，要求在2025年12月17日召开特别股东大会。知情人士表示，要求不透露身份。这些支持者包括 GoTo 的一些联合创始人，他们提议就包括更换 CEO 在内的事项进行投票，这位 CEO 在任期间，股价下跌了超过40%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean, this is freaking this is becoming like a like a a Netflix uh show in regards to kind of how ruthless corporate capitalism is done. Several GOTU shareholders signed a memo to the board requesting an extraordinary general meeting on December 17th, 2025. People familiar with the matter said asking to not be identified. The backers, which includes some of Goto's co-founders, are proposing a vote on matters inclus including replacing the CEO who oversaw a more than 40% decline in his tenure, aka the stock was down 40% over the past five years.</p>
</details>

知情人士还说，这位 CEO 也被认为反对 Grab 的收购。所以，基本上有一群重要的股东，他们是公司的高管或重要利益相关者，签署了一份备忘录，包括软银在内，要求罢免这位 CEO，原因有二。首先，这位 CEO 没能为股东带来回报，因为股价下跌了40%。看，Grab 自从通过 **SPAC** (Special Purpose Acquisition Company: 特殊目的收购公司) 上市以来，也不是表现最好的股票。但即使股价持平，Grab 的业绩也在增长。而 GoTo 的业绩则在下滑，股价也一路下跌。市场对这家公司完全没有信心。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, Wuho is also perceived as opposing a takeover by Grab, the people said. So basically you have a bunch of shareholders that are significant executives or significant stakeholders in the company signing a memo including SoftBank to get rid of the CEO because of two things. A the CEO has not been able to get shareholder returns because um uh you know the stock is down 40% and look Grab has not been the best performing stock since the Spack days either. But Grab's numbers are going like this even if the stock is flat. Go's numbers are going kind of like this and the stock is just going down. There's just like no trust in the business.</p>
</details>

更不用说今年早些时候 GoTo 创始人卷入的腐败案，他们窃取了本应提供给该地区贫困儿童的谷歌笔记本电脑的政府资金，然后中饱私囊。这简直是令人作呕地利用公司与政府的关系。结果，从品牌角度来看，很多人都不喜欢 GoTo。那位 CEO 显然反对 Grab 的收购。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Not to mention the corruption case that the go-to founders were involved in earlier this year where they were stealing money from the government that was supposed to be going to Google notebooks for underserved children in the region and they started pocketing the money for themselves. I mean just like disgusting uh use of of of corporate ties to the government and as a result you've got a lot of people from a brand perspective that are just not fans of goto. That CEO apparently is opposed to a Grab takeover.</p>
</details>

所以，有很多股东投票要求罢免这位 CEO，并为 Grab 的收购创造机会，因为这位 CEO 害怕公司被收购。显然，他反对这种情况发生。所以现在将在2025年12月17日召开一次特别股东大会。我不知道这位 CEO 是否会被罢免。我不知道 Grab 是否会正式签署一份有约束力的收购协议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you've got a lot of shareholders that are voting to get rid of the CEO and to potentially introduce the opportunity for Grab to take over given the CEO is, you know, afraid of the company taking over. Obviously, he's opposed to that taking place. So now there's going to be an extraordinary general meeting on December 17th, 2025. I don't know if the CEO is going to be ousted. I don't know if Grab's officially going to enter into a binding agreement to acquire them.</p>
</details>

我只知道，如果 Grab 能以20亿美元或更低的价格收购他们，我不想为网约车和配送业务支付超过20亿美元。我不认为它值超过20亿美元。我们肯定会加速2026年的收入和 GMV 增长。当然，你不能保证这会发生。这不能成为核心投资论点，但在过去12个月里，我们一直有关于这次收购和合并将发生的传闻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All I know is that if Grab gets them for hopefully two billion or less, I would not want to pay more than two billion for the ride hailing and delivery part of the business. I don't think it's worth more than two billion. Um, we are going to definitely accelerate revenue and GMV growth into 2026. Now, again, you can't guarantee that's going to happen. That can't be the core investing thesis, but we've had rumors over the past 12 months that this acquisition and this merger will take place.</p>
</details>

对于在这两家公司都持有大量股份的软银来说，这是最重大的进展。他们现在说，我们需要召开一次会议，看看是否能做成什么事，因为显然软银对他们的股份在过去几年里被稀释并且回报不佳感到恼火。他们希望两家公司合作是合情合理的。所以我喜欢这个消息。这对 Grab 来说是好事，对股东来说显然是强有力的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is the most significant update for uh SoftBank which has a big stake in both companies to now say we need to call a meeting and see you know if we can get something done because obviously SoftBank is annoyed that their stake has been uh diluted and you know not really returned that well over the past couple years. It makes sense that they would want to get them to work together. So I like it. It would be good for grabb obviously strong for shareholders.</p>
</details>

也许这解释了我们看到的一些暗池订单以及九月份十亿股的交易量。也许很多机构知道这会发生，他们只是比故事早了一点。但如果这真的发生了，这将是彻底的叙事重估，也是过去七个月来我们看到的最重大的进展，看起来它似乎要发生了。现在只是一个问题。如果 CEO 留任，或者他走了，软银换上一个新的 CEO，那个新 CEO 是否会与股东合作，促成与 Grab 的收购？但我们会看看情况如何发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know maybe that explains some of the darkpool orders we've had and the billion shares of volume we had in September. Maybe a lot of the institutions knew that this was going to happen and they were a little bit early to the story. But if this is happening, it's a complete narrative rerating and this is the most significant development we've seen over the past seven months that it seems like it's going to happen. It's just a question now. And if the CEO remains a CEO and uh if he's gone and and SoftBank puts in a new CEO, does that new CEO work with shareholders to make an acquisition happen with Grab? But we're going to see how that plays out.</p>
</details>

这就是 Grab 的情况，也是为什么那只股票在盘前市场上涨的原因。

中国正在考虑一项计划，通过阻止向与军方有关联的公司出口，同时加快对民用公司的审批，来防止稀土磁铁材料到达美国军事用户手中。我们看到中国在过去几周开始对美国的许多要求做出让步。显然，我们与中国就出口稀土矿物和金属达成了一项协议框架。我可以理解如果中国人不希望那些东西流向美国军方。我不认为美国会对此感到高兴。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">China is considering a plan to keep rare earth magnet materials from reaching US military users by blocking exports to military link firms while speeding approvals for civilian companies. So we've seen China start to capitulate to a lot of the United States demands over the past couple of weeks. Obviously we have that deal with the Chinese, at least a framework for a deal in terms of being able to export rare earth minerals and metals. I can understand if the Chinese don't want that stuff to go to the United States military. I don't think the United States would be that happy about that.</p>
</details>

所以这是我认为我们必须注意的一件事。但在过去几天里，你看到美国取消了对中国的关税，特别是在芬太尼问题上。你看到中国取消了出口管制。也许有某些类型的出口管制他们没有取消。但至少我们看到了中美之间健康的对话和行动。看到双方的关税开始取消，这也不是一件坏事。但如果《华尔街日报》的报道是正确的，那么这可能是稀土磁铁如何流向美国军方的一个新发展。

<p class="english-text">So that's one thing that I think we have to keep in check. But over the past couple of days, you've had the US take down our tariffs on China, particularly on fentinel. You've had China get rid of the export controls. Maybe there's certain types of export controls they're not getting rid of. But it is at least a healthy form of dialogue and action that we're seeing with China and the US. And you know, that's not a bad thing to at least see the tariffs start to go away from both sides. But if the Wall Street Journal is correct on that, then that might be a new development in regards to how rare earth magnets are going to be going to the US military.</p>

这确实是一个非常大的里程碑。我们一直想成为满足您所有金融服务需求的一站式商店。过去两年我们一直存在的一个缺口就是加密货币，即购买、出售和持有加密货币的能力。作为一家银行，我们不被允许这样做。这是不被允许的。但今年三月，**OCC** (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency: 美国货币监理署) 发布了一份解释性信函，现在像 SoFi 这样的银行可以提供加密货币服务了。所以今天早上，我们作为第一家也是唯一一家全国性银行，推出了购买、出售和持有像比特币、以太坊和 Solana 这样的加密货币的机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, this morning for you. It is a very big deal. Uh, it's a big day and a big milestone. uh reverses the course of time. Um it does. We've wanted to be a one-stop shop for all your financial services needs. And one of the holes we've had for the last two years was in cryptocurrency, the ability to buy, sell, and hold crypto. Uh we were not allowed to do that as a bank. It was not permissible. But in March of this year, the OC came out with an interpretive letter that it's now permissible for banks like SoFi to offer cryptocurrencies. So this morning we're launching as the only national bank, the first and only national bank, the opportunity to buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solano.</p>
</details>

我们将远远不止三种。这将是一个相当广泛的选择。我们试图在速度快、选择多、价格优、易于使用方面实现差异化。所以我们会努力给 SoFi 会员尽可能多的选择。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Uh we'll expand well beyond three. It'll be a pretty broad assortment. We try to differentiate on being fast, having broad selection, great prices, ease of use. So we'll try to give members, SoFi members, as much selection as they would like. And what's the difference between going through you and going through Coinbase or going through Robin Hood or somebody else?</p>
</details>

有几个非常大的区别。首先，我们是一家全国性特许银行，这意味着我们拥有基础设施、流程和财务状况，能够提供消费者期望从银行获得的安全保障。这将使我们能够负责任地扩展。其次，因为我们是一站式商店，你可以在 SoFi 进行所有的银行业务、支票和储蓄、借贷和投资，现在还有加密货币。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, there's a couple of really big differences. First, we're a nationally chartered bank, which means we have the infrastructure, the processes, the financial conditions that provides the safeguards that a consumer would expect from a bank. Um, which is going to allow us to scale responsibly. Uh, the second thing is because we are a one-stop shop, you can do all your banking, checking and savings at SoFi, your borrowing and your investing, and now crypto.</p>
</details>

其中一个独特之处在于，当你来到 SoFi 并为你的加密货币投资注资时，你将把资金存入一个 SoFi 支票和储蓄账户。那个支票和储蓄账户的存款可以赚取利息。当你没有把现金投入工作时，它不会躺在一个不赚利息的账户里，也不会躺在一个没有保险的账户里。所以钱会存在一个 **FDIC** (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation: 联邦存款保险公司) 保险的账户里，我们提供高达200万美元的保险，当你购买时，它会立即从那个账户中提取，并发送到市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And one of the unique things about that is when you come to SoFi and fund your crypto investments, you'll fund them in a SoFi checking and savings account. That checking and savings accounts deposits earn interest. >> Say that again. You're going to fund it with crypto. >> You're going to fund your checking account. >> You're going to fund your checking account with cash. Okay? >> And then when you buy >> Bitcoin or Solano or Ethereum, the money will come straight out of your checking savings account. So when you're not putting cash to work, it's not sitting in an account that earns no interest and it's not sitting in an account that's not insured. So the money will sit in an FDIC insured account up to $2 million is what we offer and when you buy it will instantly withdraw from that account and sending it to the marketplace.</p>
</details>

我不这么认为，有几个原因。我们是唯一一家数字化的“一站式商店”。他们不提供我们所提供的跨越借贷、储蓄、投资、保护和消费的广泛产品。所以我们不仅有能力购买加密货币，我们现在还提供通过**闪电网络**（Lightning Network: 一个建立在比特币区块链之上的第二层支付协议，旨在实现快速、低成本的交易）进行国际支付的能力，这是一个加密网络，我们还会增加其他网络。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I don't. And a couple of reasons for that. We're the only digital one-stop shop. They do not offer the breath of products that we offer across borrowing, saving, investing, protecting, um, and and and spending. So, we have the ability to not just buy cryptocurrency, but we're now providing the ability to send payments internationally via uh the Lightning Network, which is a crypto uh network, and we'll add others to that.</p>
</details>

他们得自己回答为什么。我从根本上相信，我们把会员放在我们所做一切的中心。我们专注于与你的钱有关的活动，而不是产品。所以 SoFi 货币账户是一个你可以用于国际汇款、自助电汇、现在还可以用于购买加密货币、通过电子邮件和 Zelle 向朋友付款的账户。所以整个想法是利用技术让你的资金流动尽可能简单，同时也做所有你需要做的其他事情来管好你的钱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> They'll have to answer why. I fundamentally believe that we put the member at the center of that what we do. We focus on these things that are activities to do with your money, not products. And so the SoFi money account is an account that you can use for international remittance, you could use for self-s served wires, you can now use for crypto buying, you could use for paying friends via email, Enzel. And so the whole idea is to leverage technology to make moving your money as easy as possible, but also doing all the other things you need to do to get your money right.</p>
</details>

首先，我们问过我们的会员他们想要什么，60%的人说他们想投资加密货币，但他们想从像银行这样的受监管实体来做，而我们就是。所以这是一个差异化。其次，它是一种高风险资产。它应该只占总投资组合中非常非常小的一部分，人们应该采用美元成本平均法投入，并确保保持非常多元化，因为它有风险且波动大。你可能会损失所有的钱，我们想确保我们的会员明白这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> The first thing is we've asked our members what they want and 60% of them have said they would like to invest in crypto, but they want to do it from a regulated entity like a bank and that's what we are. And so that's one differentiation. The second is it is a highly risky asset. It should be a very very small piece of a total portfolio and and people should dollar cost average into it and make sure they stay very diversified because it is risky and is volatile. You could lose all of your money and we want to make sure that our members understand that.</p>
</details>

是的，我们投资。我的可投资资产中大约有3%是加密货币，主要是比特币。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yes, we do. I have about 3% of my investable assets in cryptocurrency. >> Mostly in Bitcoin or what's the >> mostly in Bitcoin >> and we were</p>
</details>

Noto 说他净资产的3%在比特币里，或者说不是净资产，是可投资资产。我的意思是，这对于一个想要向所有人正式提供加密货币的公司CEO来说，是相当重要的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> no to to crypto bro 3% of his net worth in Bitcoin. I mean or not net worth but investable assets. I mean that's that that I mean that's pretty significant coming from him as a CEO of a company that wants to officially offer crypto to everybody.</p>
</details>

我不是特别早。我们做得相当不错。我们有敞口，因为我相信我们投资的是一项技术，而不是一种货币。我用来向人们解释的比喻是，想象一下，如果在1990年，你可以通过一种叫做“万维网币”的硬币购买一部分万维网。这非常相似。这些是网络。它们是用于支付和其他应用的通信网络。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Early I was not super early. I we've done perfectly fine. we have exposure to because one I believe we're investing in a technology not in a currency. Um the analogy I use with people is imagine if in 1990 you could have bought a piece of the worldwide web through some coin called the worldwide webcoin. It's very similar to that. These are networks. They're communication networks used for payments and other applications. What do you make? We were</p>
</details>

看到这些知名CEO做出这样的类比真是太酷了。我知道比特币的价格在过去几个月里表现不是最好的，但世界上一些最聪明的人坚信这将会很重要，从长远来看，他们并不在乎。他们只是想拥有这个资产的敞口。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> it is just so cool to see these high-profile CEOs make these type of analogies. I mean, like, I know the Bitcoin price action has not really been the best over the past couple of months, but like some of the smartest people in the world just are convicted that this is going to matter and over the long term, you know, they kind of don't care. They just want to have exposure to the asset.</p>
</details>

从大的图景来看，我们相信区块链和加密货币是一个超级周期技术，就像人工智能一样，它将普及到整个金融系统。稳定币就是一个例子，它将从根本上改变支付方式。SoFi 将推出 **SoFi USD**（SoFi 美元稳定币），希望在一月份。它将由储备金按一比一的比例支持。因为我们是银行，我们实际上会把美元存入我们的美联储银行账户。所以我们将没有流动性风险，没有信用风险，并且能赚取联邦基金利率。这对人们使用数字货币来说是一个非常有吸引力的工具，它将与其他数字货币竞争。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that might have been used for that big big picture we believe blockchain and cryptocurrencies are a super cycle technology super cycle just like AI and it will be pervasive across all the financial system stable coins is one example that will fundamentally change payments. SoFi will launch SoFi USD uh hopefully in January. That'll be backed dollar fordoll by by reserves. Because we are a bank, we'll actually put the dollars in our Fed bank account. So we'll have no liquidity risk, no credit risk, and earn Fed funds. That's a really attractive um vehicle for people to use digital currency for and that will compete with other digital currencies.</p>
</details>

我实际上非常担心那些非银行运营商发行的稳定币。储备金放在哪里？这些储备金是否存在期限风险？是否存在信用风险？这些储备金是否与破产隔离？对于 SoFi，答案是零信用风险，零流动性风险，并且正在努力实现破产隔离。这是你在使用任何稳定币时都必须考虑的三个要素。仅仅因为它是一比一支持的，并不意味着当你试图清算时那些美元就会在那里，就像一个跌破面值的货币市场基金一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Yeah, I actually worry quite significantly about stable coins from operators that are not banks. Where are the reserves sitting? Is there duration risk for those reserves? Is there credit risk for those reserves? Are those reserves bankruptcy remote? SoFi, the answer to that is zero credit risk, zero liquidity risk, and working on bankruptcy remote. That's three elements that you have to think about with whatever stable coin you use. Just because it's back dollar for dollar doesn't mean those dollars will be there when you try to liquidate, just like a money market fund that breaks a buck.</p>
</details>

看，我认为 SoFi 正式恢复加密货币业务是非常令人印象深刻的。我想大约在今年二月、三月左右，OCC 发布声明说银行将被允许交易加密货币。我不知道有多少人认为他们能在大约八、九个月内做到这一点，但看起来他们做了他们必须做的事。他们完成了任务。显然，特朗普政府从放松管制的角度也让他们更容易地参与进来，他们做到了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> all right there. And those are his thoughts on SoFi. Now look, I think it is very impressive for SoFi to officially have crypto coming back to the platform. I think earlier this year, right around February, March is when the OC came out and said that banks are going to be allowed to trade cryptogrand. And you know, I don't know how many people thought they were going to be able to do it in about eight, nine months, but it seems like they did what they had to do. They got the job done. And obviously the Trump administration from a deregulatory perspective also made it easier for them to get on board with this and they got it done.</p>
</details>

所以加密货币将回到 SoFi。Tanner 昨天在我们的 Tech Bros 播客上说，SoFi 将对其加密货币收取1%的费用。所以它比 Coinbase 少，比 Robin Hood 多一点。所以它处于中间位置。他们可能不打算 undercut Robin Hood，他们可能只是想收取标准的1%费用。我们将不得不看看投资平台上的加密货币交易量会随着时间的推移如何变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So crypto will be coming back to SoFi. Tanner yesterday said on our Tech Bros podcast that SoFi is going to be charging 1% as a fee on uh their crypto. So it's less than Coinbase. It's a bit more than Robin Hood. So it's kind of in the middle right there. And they're probably not looking to undercut Robin Hood. They're probably just looking to charge a standard 1% fee. And you know, we're going to have to see what the crypto volumes look like on the invest platform over time.</p>
</details>

我要说的一件事是，这不是看跌的。当你在平台上有更多的产品，特别是人们真正关心的资产，比如加密货币、比特币、以太坊、Solana，人们会想要交易它。如果人们开始在 SoFi 上交易，如果你已经把所有的银行和金融资产都放在这个平台上，你可能会开始买一些股票，你可能会开始交易一些期权。那不是他们的核心业务，但从根本上说，如果你把所有这些都整合在生态系统中，那绝对是看涨的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The one thing I will say is that this is not bearish. So right there, $3043. It was up 9% yesterday. Uh when you have more offerings on the platform, especially offerings for assets that people really care about, obviously like cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Salana, I mean, people are going to want to trade it. And if people start trading it on SoFi, if you already have all your banking and financial assets on the platform, you might start buying some stocks, you might start trading some options. that's not their core business, but at its at its core, if you have all that integrated in the ecosystem, that's definitely bullish.</p>
</details>

所以我认为 SoFi 这样做是好事。我想很多人一直在等待这个。那些真正 hardcore 的 SoFi 超级用户，他们也使用投资平台和银行业务，可能想要这个选项。我的意思是，你可能会看到一些资产离开像 Robin Hood 这样的公司，转到 SoFi，因为他们终于提供加密货币了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I think it's good for SoFi to do this. I think a lot of people have been waiting for this. The real real hardcore SoFi power users that use the invest platform as well and the banking probably wanted this option. I mean, you might get some assets leaving companies like Robin Hood to go to SoFi now that they finally offer crypto.</p>
</details>

但这有点有趣。SoFi 带来了加密货币，Robin Hood 带来了银行业务。所以这两个家伙正从不同的角度进入市场，试图相互竞争，消费者将弄清楚他们最终想长期使用哪个产品。所以这就是我们对 SoFi 的看法，随着加密货币现在来到这个平台，非常看好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, but it is kind of funny. So bringing crypto, Robin Hood is bringing banking. So it's like both of these guys are going into different perspectives to try to compete with each other and you know consumers are going to figure out which product they ultimately want to use long term. So that's what we got on SoFi very bullish as crypto has now come to the platform.</p>
</details>

### 其他公司财报与市场动态

昨天有财报。那么，哪些公司表现出色呢？嗯，Rocket Lab 是其中之一。Rocket Lab，对吧？他们在盘前市场上涨了7%。他们距离盈利只差三美分，这对于像 Rocket Lab 这样的公司来说非常令人兴奋。他们正在接近盈利。他们的收入也超出了预期。所以，我认为如果你是 Rocket Lab 的股东，你肯定对昨天的财报感到满意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh earnings yesterday. So, what companies crushed it? Well, Rocket Lab is one of the uh companies that crushed it. Rocket Lab, right? They're up 7% in the pre-markets. They are three cents away from profitability, which is very exciting for a company like Rocket Lab. They are getting close to being profitable. They also beat on revenue. So, I think if you are a Rocket Lab shareholder, you were definitely happy with those earnings yesterday.</p>
</details>

Big Bear AI，他们在盘前市场也上涨了。尽管他们同比下降了20%，但华尔街似乎不太在意，因为他们的每股收益超出了57%，收入超出了4%。他们继续指引1.4亿美元，这将是财年指引同比下降约30%。所以他们没有上调指引。他们昨天收购了一家公司。他们花了2.5亿美元收购了一家年收入2500万美元、拥有10万客户和政府机构的公司。所以也许这可以增加他们进入2026年的收入指引。但总的来说，股市中认知就是现实。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Big Bear AI, they are also up in the pre-markets. Again, they are growing negative 20% year-over-year, but the street doesn't seem to care about that too much because they beat by 57% on EPS, beat by 4% on revenue. Uh, they are uh continuing to guide for 140 million, which would be down about 30% year-over-year in terms of the fiscal year guide. So they have not upgraded their guidance. They did acquire a company yesterday. They paid $250 million for a company doing 25 million in revenue, 100,000 customers and governmental agencies. So maybe that could increase that revenue guide going into 2026. But overall perception is reality in the stock market.</p>
</details>

认知是 Big Bear AI 的表现会比预期的差得多。而他们以相当大的优势超出了预期，每股收益超出57%。这就是为什么那只股票是绿色的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the perception was that Big Bear AI would do way worse than expected. And they beat by a hefty margin, beating EPS by 57%. That's why that stock is green.</p>
</details>

Coreweave，我们快速谈谈。Coreweave 怎么了？我只能得出结论，鉴于他们的每股收益超出了57%，从预期的负51美分到负22美分，然后收入从预期的12.8亿到13.6亿，收入同比增长三位数，每股收益同比增长88%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Coreweave, let's talk about that real quick. What is going on with Cororeweave? I can only conclude given they beat by 57% on EPS negative 22 cents versus 51 expected and then 1.36 versus 1.28 billion again revenues up triple digits EPS is up 88% year-over-year.</p>
</details>

我唯一的结论是，在听了昨天的电话会议后，他们正在指引的债务状况，即使他们说他们是通过基于需求的债务来指引增加债务，所以他们试图软化他们增加债务的冲击，因为他们说这是来自需求，这是一个合理的论点，但对华尔街来说正变得有点激进。他们下调了2026财年的收入指引，这让华尔街不高兴。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My only conclusion after listening to the call yesterday and some of you guys were with me listening to the call is that the debt profile that they are guiding for even if they say they're guiding for increased debt via demandbased debt. So they're trying to, you know, soften the blow that they're increasing debt because they're saying it's from demand, which is like a reasonable argument is just becoming a little aggressive for the street. They lowered their fiscal year 2026 revenue guidance that got the street upset.</p>
</details>

他们下调了调整后的 EBITDA 指引。这并不是什么大事，也绝对不是需求下降的迹象。但如果你在下调指引的同时增加债务，即使他们可能只是为了在2026年能够超出并上调指引而下调指引，我认为这就是为什么华尔街有点不高兴。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And they lowered their adjusted EBA guidance. Now that's not that big of a deal. And it's definitely not a sign of demand is going down. But if you're lowering guidance and you're increasing debt, even if you know they might be lowering guidance just to be able to beat and raise going to 2026, I think that's why the street's a little upset.</p>
</details>

另外，真正让他们的股票受到打击的原因是，有一件事将延迟他们的一个客户建立数据中心。我会看看我是否能找到确切的引述。这正在造成更多的痛苦。摩根大通将他们的评级从135美元下调至110美元。还有几家其他公司将他们的评级下调至100美元区间。我不知道是否需要如此激进的下调，但不管怎样，这就是今天发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Also, the the the the the real like kicker for why their stock got hit is because there was something that is going to delay one of their clients setting up uh a data center. I'll see if I can get the exact quote. And that is causing a little bit more pain. JP Morgan downgraded them to 110 from 135. You had a couple other firms downgrade them into the 100s. I don't know if it needed to be that aggressive of a downgrade, but nonetheless, that's what happened today.</p>
</details>

引述是：“我们受到一个第三方数据中心开发商的临时延误影响，该开发商进度落后。”他们确实说，这个延误不会降低客户的利润率，而且在他们已经指引的5%范围内。所以这并不是一个应该损害公司的重大延误。但我认为华尔街只是对所有这些公司都在承担债务感到恼火，而 Core 是下一个承担大量债务并增加债务负担的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Here's the quote. We are affected by a temporary delay by a thirdparty data center developer who is beyond behind schedule. They did say that uh that delay is not going to decrease the margin profile on the customer and that um it's within like 5% of what they already guided for. So it's not like a substantial delay that should be hurting the company. But I think the street's just annoyed that all these companies are taking on debt and core is the next one to take on a massive amount of debt and increase that debt load.</p>
</details>

也许这个债务负担变得有点太大了，即使他们将收入积压翻了一番，达到550亿美元，这对数据中心和 AI 来说是净利好，因为有这么多的需求。只是 Core 作为一个运营业务，即使他们距离盈利只有20美分，也是华尔街难以分析的事情，仅仅是因为他们承担的债务水平，债务与权益比率，现在已经远远超过300%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And maybe that debt load is becoming a bit too substantial even though they doubled their revenue backlog to 55 billion which is net bullish data centers AI in general because there's so much demand. It's just core as an operating business even though they're 20 cents away from profitability is something that the street is struggling with to deal to analyze with just given the the the level of debt that they're taking on debt to equity ratio you know at this point now well over 300%.</p>
</details>

### 宏观经济观察：劳动力市场与关税政策

特朗普昨晚发推文谈论了最高法院的决定。我一直在告诉你们，根据我读到的信息，最高法院是否会支持他，这并不确定。特朗普昨晚非常沮丧，他基本上对人们需要更多地了解关税大发雷霆。他说，美国最高法院得到了错误的数字。如果关税出现负面裁决，其影响将包括投资和资金回流超过三万亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, uh, Trump tweeted last night about the Supreme Court decision. Again, I've been telling you guys from what I've been reading, it it it is not confirmed that the Supreme Court is going to go his way. And, uh, we got about 40 seconds till the market opens. You know, Trump was pretty upset last night and he basically went off on how people need to understand more about tariffs. Uh, he said the US Supreme Court was given the wrong numbers. the unwind in the event of a negative decision on tariffs would be including investment b and return of funds in excess of three trillion.</p>
</details>

那种打击将永远无法弥补，那将真正成为一个无法克服的国家安全事件，对我们国家的未来是毁灭性的，可能无法持续。所以显然特朗普正试图警告最高法院，说嘿，如果你们取消关税，对美国来说将是3万亿美元的意外损失。这就是为什么你也有 Bent 解释为什么关税是我们长期需要更关心的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It would be not possible to ever make up for that kind of drubbing that would truly become an insurmountable national security event and devastating to the future of our country possibly non sustainable. So obviously Trump is trying to warn the Supreme Court saying hey if you guys get rid of the tariffs it's going to be a $3 trillion windfall for the United States. And that's why you have Bent as well explaining why the tariffs you know are something that we do need to care about more going into the long term.</p>
</details>

我们今天早上从 ADP 私营部门就业数据中看到的一件事是，在十月份，私营部门就业人数在过去四周平均每周下降到11,000人，这显然不是好事。每周11,000个工作岗位并不是显著的增长，这支持了劳动力市场存在一些问题的论点。美联储的概率现在显示，12月份降息的可能性为67.4%。再说一次，我看不到不降息的世界。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, one thing I saw today from the ADP private payrolls is that in October you had private payrolls falling to 11,000 a week on an average over the past four weeks, which is obviously not good. 11,000 jobs a week is like not significant growth, which feeds the argument that the labor market has having some issues. The uh Fed probabilities now show a 67.4% chance for a rate cut in December. Again, I don't see a world where the rate cut doesn't happen.</p>

### 盘中走势：市场波动与个股表现

Coreweave 当日下跌9%。Navius 上涨1.682%。我想它在盘前市场最低跌到了108，现在是111。上涨了1.34%，略微收绿。Coreweave 受到重创，下跌了9%。Duolingo 下跌1%。Grabby Grab 上涨了5%。我认为这5%的涨幅显然是基于他们可能收购 GoTo 的传闻。所以你得看看这是否可持续。

<details>

<p class="english-text">All right, wake your ass up. Let's get into it. Coreweave down 9% on the day. goes red. Navius up 1.682%. I think it got to a lows of 108 in the pre-market right now at 111. That's up 1.34 slightly green. Coreweave is getting hit 9% right there. Dualingo down 1%. Grabby Grab gets a 5% move. Uh I think that 5% move is obviously based on this rumor that they could be acquiring Goto. So you got to see if that is sustainable.</p>

CleanSpark 下跌5%。他们昨天稀释了11.5亿美元。这就是 CleanSpark 下跌的原因。他们将用11.5亿美元中的4.2亿美元回购他们的股票，这总是让我感到困惑，当公司稀释股份然后又回购他们的股票时。但不管怎样，这就是 Clean Spark 正在做的事情。这就是为什么那只股票下跌了5%。

But nonetheless, that's what Clean Spark is doing. That's why that stock is down 5%.</p>

Open Door，首席执行官说他和他的家人今天将购买价值一百万美元的股票。毫不夸张地说，首席执行官昨天发推文说他和他的家人将购买价值一百万美元的股票。摩根大通将他们的评级上调至8美元。所以，我认为你把这两个催化剂放在一起，这就是为什么那只股票回到了8美元并且是绿色的。

<p class="english-text">Open Door, uh, the CEO said he and his family are buying a million dollars worth of stock today. Quite literally, the CEO yesterday tweeted that he and his family are buying a million dollars worth of stock. JP Morgan upgraded them to $8. So, I think you put two of those catalysts together. That's why that stock is back to eight and that's green.</p>

昨天我没想到标普500指数会上涨，但我们做到了。我也没想到英伟达会上涨6%，但我们也做到了。所以，我的意思是，我认为市场在经历了一次大规模上涨后，休息一天是可以的，特别是因为前一周是大规模下跌。所以，你知道，你可能希望这能盘整一下。

<p class="english-text">And honestly, I think the red is kind of healthy. Yesterday, I didn't expect% move on the S&P 500, but we got it. I also didn't expect a 6% move on Nvidia, but we also got that. So, I mean, I I kind of think it's okay for the market to take a breather a day after a massive move, especially because the week before it was a massive move down. So, you know, you probably want to have this consolidate.</p>

DA Davidson 表示“表现不佳”。他们的目标价是36美元。我们重申我们的“表现不佳”评级和36美元的目标价，此前第三季度财报的亮点是盈利能力再次恶化，全年资本支出、收入和利润指引被大幅下调。我们继续认为这个业务不值得扩展。哇，这是来自 DA Davidson 的 Gil Lauria 的一个相当难看的降级。

<p class="english-text">DA Davidson says underperformed. They have a $36 price target. We reiterate our underperform rating and $36 price target following the three Q earnings that were highlighted by another quart of deteriorating profitability, significant downward revisions to to fullyear capex revenue and profit guidance. We continue believe this business is not worth scaling. Wow, that's a pretty ugly downgrade from Gil Lauria at DA Davidson.</p>

摩根大通表示：“我们继续看到巨大的长期机会。不利的一面是，新的可变供应链压力升级到了影响一个特定的第三方数据中心的地步，该数据中心进度落后，这将 Coreweave 的部分第四季度收入转移了。这意味着不仅是主要的超大规模云服务商被迫发布受容量限制的收入指引，而且这种现象也正在蔓延到 Core，它历来为协调和及时部署现代 AI 数据中心设定了最高的标准之一。”这似乎并不那么悲观。他们只是对第四季度收入因第三方数据中心开发商的延迟而下降感到恼火。他们将评级从135美元下调至110美元，但这似乎并不像是对整个投资论点感到不满。

<p class="english-text">JP Morgan says, "We continue to see tremendous long-term opportunity on the negative side. the new variable supply chain pressures escalating to a point that they are impacting one specific thirdparty data center which is running behind and that shifts some of Cororeweave's Q4 revenue. This means that they are not only major hyperscalers being forced to issue capacity constrained revenue guidance but the phenomenon is also spreading to Coree which has historically set one of the highest bars for orchestration and delivers timely deployment of modern AI data centers. This doesn't seem that bearish. They're kind of just annoyed that Q4 revenue is going down because of the delay on the third party data center developer. they downgraded them from 135 to 110, but that's not seeming to be like upset with the thesis.</p>

我爱 Tom Lee，但我不知道我们年底前能否达到9000美元。我不知道。那就像是1月前达到9000到12000美元。我的意思是，也许吧。也许这有点激进。这是他昨天和 Tom Nash 的采访，谈论加密货币，有很多 OG，也就是原始的比特币持有者，在10万美元以上卖出，但这仍然是一个配置不足的资产类别。

<p class="english-text">I love Tom. I don't know if we're doing 9,000, bro. I don't know. It was like 9 to 12,000 by January. I mean, maybe maybe it'd be a bit aggressive. This was his interview yesterday with Tom Nash talking about crypto and there have been a lot of OGs, uh, original Bitcoiners that are selling above 100,000, but it is still an underallocated asset class.</p>

所以我认为比特币实际上有可能达到10万的高位，你知道，甚至可能在年底前达到20万。我认为这是一个很大的要求，但对我来说，更明显的是以太坊，在年底前可能会有巨大的涨幅，因为连 Kathy Wood 都写过。她认为稳定币一直在蚕食对比特币的需求，黄金和代币化黄金也在蚕食对比特币的需求。但稳定币和代币化黄金运行在像以太坊这样的智能合约区块链上，华尔街正在建设，Larry Fink 希望将华尔街的一切都代币化到区块链上。这意味着以太坊是人们开始提高增长预期的地方。如果你提高增长预期，那么你对未来的折现就会上升。所以我认为以太坊的涨幅会更大。我们的技术策略主管 Mark Newton 认为，到一月份我们会达到9000到12000美元。我认为这差不多。我认为以太坊从现在到年底会翻倍以上。

<p class="english-text">So, I think Bitcoin actually potentially can get to the high 100,000s, you know, maybe even 200,000 by the end of the year. I think it's a big ask, but to me, um, what's more obvious is Ethereum, uh, can have a huge move into your end because even Kathy Wood wrote about it. She thinks stable coins have been cannibalizing demand for Bitcoin and and gold and tokenized gold is cannibalizing demand for Bitcoin. But stable coins and tokenized gold run on smart contract blockchains like Ethereum and Wall Street is building and Larry Frink wants to tokenize everything on Wall on on on the blockchain. That means Ethereum is where people are starting to raise their growth expectations. And if you're raising your growth expectations, then your your your discount to the future is going up. So I I think that there's a bigger move in Ethereum. And Mark Newton, our head of technical strategy, thinks we're going to be like 9 to 12,000 by January. I think that's about right. I think Ethereum just 3,600 more than doubles between now and year end.</p>

好的，各位，今天就到这里。标普500指数失守680点。价格走势非常震荡，来回波动。再说一次，我们周一表现非常好，周二回吐一些涨幅并不奇怪。如果我们上涨了1.5%，然后回吐了0.3%，我认为这没关系。我会在收盘时回来。我们有 Oaklo 的财报。我们会看看是否进行技术星期二的分析，然后我们会继续。明天我们有更多的财报，英伟达是下周的下一个大催化剂。

<p class="english-text">All right, that's it for me, folks. S&P lose a 680. Very choppy price action back and forth. Uh again, we had a really good day on Monday. Not crazy to see Tuesday kind of give back some of those gains. And if we're up one and a half and we're giving back.3, I think that's all right. I'll be back for the close. We got Oaklo. We'll see if we do TT and um then we'll keep going from there. Tomorrow we have a bunch more earnings and Nvidia is the next big catalyst going into next week.</p>

所以这就是我们的情况。再说一次，这个劳动力市场的事情是我认为我们都必须关注的最重要的事情。但除了劳动力市场，希望12月份会降息。这方面的概率非常重要。然后是英伟达。如果你能得到一个不错的英伟达交易，即使在降息下降的情况下，当停摆结束时，我们会得到更多的劳动力市场数据，然后就能概念化劳动力市场在更多降息的情况下会发生什么，如果到明年年底交付的话。

<p class="english-text">So that's what we got. Again, this labor market thing is the most important thing I think we all have to be paying attention to. But outside of the labor market, rate cuts coming up hopefully in December. The probabilities of that are really important. And then you got Nvidia. If you can get a good you can get a decent Nvidia trade even with declining rate cuts when the shutdown opens we'll get more labor market data and uh you know then be able to conceptualize what's going on with the labor market in the face of more rate cuts if deliverant thing going into the end of next year</p>

好了，谢谢大家。感谢你们。Siege，感谢你成为频道会员。谢谢你，伙计。感谢你的到来。C Harris，感谢你的超级留言。你认为 Android 什么时候会 IPO？我完全不知道。我猜是27年。Harlucky 确实说过几年后，可能不是26年，但如果他们在27年 IPO，我们知道拥有 Andro 股份的 Douggee 先生会非常高兴。所以，可能再过几年。
