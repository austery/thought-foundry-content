### 瑞士新年火灾惨案

**Tracy Mumford**: 来自《纽约时报》，我是 Tracy Mumford。今天是2026年1月2日。以下是我们今天报道的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's January 2nd, 2026. Here's what we're covering.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: **瑞士**当局称，新年夜在一处滑雪胜地发生的酒吧火灾是该国经历过的最严重的悲剧之一。约40人死亡，115人受伤，许多人伤势严重。该国的烧伤治疗中心不堪重负，一些伤者已被送往其他国家。官员表示，目前评论火灾原因尚早，但火灾由一次**闪燃**引发，即封闭空间内的表面达到足够高的温度，几乎同时被点燃，火焰以致命的速度蔓延。至少发生了一次爆炸。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Authorities in Switzerland are calling the New Year's Eve fire that ripped through a pack bar in a ski resort one of the worst tragedies the country has ever experienced. About 40 people were killed and 115 injured, many of them seriously. The country's burn units have been overwhelmed to the point that some victims have been sent to other countries. Officials say it's too early to comment on the cause of the fire, but the blaze set off a flashover when surfaces in an enclosed space become hot enough to ignite almost simultaneously, spreading flames with lethal speed. At least one explosion followed.

</details>

**>>**: 我遇到一位当时在场的一位年轻人。他看到烟雾后冲了出来，所以没有受伤。但他告诉我，他的朋友留在了里面并受了伤，她住进了该地区的主要医院，他在那里等了一整天想知道她的情况，但他们不让他见她。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: I met a young man who was inside when it happened. He rushed out when he saw the smoke, so he was not harmed. But he told me that his friend stayed inside and was injured and she was at the main hospital in the area and it's where he waited all day to find out how she was, but they didn't let him see her.

</details>

**>>**: 我的同事 Segalin Lustradik 正在从**Kron Matana**镇报道，该镇以滑雪和阿尔卑斯山景色吸引游客。她去了火灾现场。周围的街道已被警察封锁。然后，在其中一条街道上，有一个小桌子，镇上的人们前来摆放鲜花和蜡烛。我和其中一些人聊了聊。他们大多是年轻人，因为我们从与当地人的交谈中了解到，那是一家18、20岁左右年轻人常去的酒吧。我采访了这四个人，他们都17岁，本应在那家酒吧。他们来晚了一点，等他们到的时候，警察和消防员已经在那里了。人们正在往外冲。他们说，你知道，人们互相踩踏，那是彻底的恐慌。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: My colleague Segalin Lustradik is reporting from the town Kron Matana, which draws people for skiing and its views of the Alps. She went to the site of the fire. The streets around had been cordoned off by police officers. And then on one of these streets, there was a little table where people from the town came and placed flowers and candles. And I talked to some of them. They were mostly young people because as we found out from talking to people here, it was a bar where mostly 18-year-old, 20 year olds would go to. I talked to this group of four. They were all 17 and they were supposed to be at the bar. They arrived a little bit late and when they got there, the police and firemen were already there. People were rushing out. They said that, you know, people were trampling each other, that it was total panic.

</details>

**>>**: 我认为现在会有很多关注点放在准确理解发生了什么事上，因为从我和人们交谈以及社交媒体上发布的视频和照片来看，似乎只有一个出口，而且人们感觉像是被推下了楼。所以我认为现在会有很多关注点放在问责制、酒吧的安全措施以及它为何会如此迅速地燃起大火上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**>>**: I think now there's going to be a lot of attention on understanding exactly what happened because from what I found out talking to people and I think some of the videos and photos that are being posted on social media, it seems like there was only one exit and there's a feeling that people were dropped downstairs. So I think there's going to be a lot of attention now on accountability, safety measures at the bar and how it could just go up in flames so quickly.

### 特朗普放弃国民警卫队部署

**Tracy Mumford**: **特朗普**总统已宣布，他将放弃在**芝加哥**、**洛杉矶**和**波特兰**这三个主要城市部署**国民警卫队**的努力。此举标志着他试图测试其权力极限的最引人注目的尝试之一的重大退却。然而，在地面上，居民们可能不会看到太多变化。在多项法律挑战中，驻扎在波特兰和芝加哥的部队几乎没有公开露面。而在洛杉矶，**白宫**已开始放弃控制国民警卫队士兵的企图。特朗普的声明是在**最高法院**发布初步裁决，阻止政府在芝加哥部署国民警卫队部队（州和地方官员对此表示反对）大约一周后发出的。值得注意的是，特朗普并未从**华盛顿特区**或田纳西州的**孟菲斯**和路易斯安那州的**新奥尔良**撤兵，这些城市由共和党领导，其州长并未挑战这些部署。特朗普在社交媒体上写道，他将来不会犹豫重新部署部队。他引用的话是：“当犯罪再次飙升时，我们将以一种截然不同且更强大的形式回来，这只是时间问题。”

**Tracy Mumford**: President Trump has announced that he will abandon efforts to deploy the National Guard in three major cities, Chicago, LA, and Portland. The move marks a significant retreat from one of his most high-profile attempts to test the limits of his power. On the ground, though, residents may not see much of a change. Amid multiple legal challenges, the troops in Portland and Chicago already had almost no public presence. And in LA, the White House had already begun backing away from attempts to keep control of National Guard soldiers there. Trump's announcement came about a week after the Supreme Court issued a preliminary ruling blocking the administration from deploying National Guard troops in Chicago, where state and local officials had objected to it. Notably, Trump is not pulling back troops from Washington DC or from Memphis and New Orleans, cities in Republicanled states where the governors haven't challenged the deployments. Writing on social media, Trump said he would not hesitate to redeploy troops in the future. Quote, "We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again, only a question of time.

### 医保补贴失效，费用飙升

**Tracy Mumford**: 从这个月开始，由于国会延长**医保**（Obamacare）计划的增强型医疗补助的努力失败，数百万美国人正面临更高的保费。**《纽约时报》**采访了受价格上涨影响的人们，包括加州一个四口之家，他们的计划费用从每月1300美元涨到了4000美元；以及北卡罗来纳州一对夫妇，他们的费用将从每月约600美元涨到3000美元。因此，人们表示他们正在做出艰难的选择。有些人决定不购买健康保险，就像俄勒冈州一位58岁的女性，她告诉《纽约时报》，她决定为丈夫保留保险，但取消了自己的保险。其他人则选择保费较低但需要支付数千美元自付费用的计划。还有一些人表示，他们计划限制今年的收入，以便能够尝试获得仍提供给低收入人群的补贴。立法者仍有可能在今年某个时候决定延长增强型补贴，但控制**国会**的**共和党**内部就此问题存在内斗。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Starting this month, millions of Americans are now facing much higher costs for their Obamacare plans after efforts in Congress to extend enhanced health care subsidies failed. The Times talked with people affected by the price hikes, including a family of four in California whose plan has gone from $1,300 a month to 4,000. and a couple in North Carolina who are looking at a jump from roughly $600 a month to 3,000. As a result, people say they're making hard choices. Some are deciding to go without health insurance, like a 58-year-old woman in Oregon who told the Times she decided to keep coverage for her husband but drop it for herself. Others are choosing plans that have a lower premium but require them to pay thousands of dollars more in out-ofpocket costs. and still others say they're planning to limit the amount of money they make this year so they can try and qualify for subsidies still available to those at lower income levels. Lawmakers could still decide to extend the enhanced subsidies sometime this year, but there's been infighting in the Republican party, which controls Congress, about whether or not to do so.

### AI进课堂引担忧

**Tracy Mumford**: 在过去的几个月里，**硅谷**科技巨头将**人工智能**嵌入课堂的推动力一直在增强。这在全球各地都在发生，比如泰国、冰岛、印度。**微软**已签署一项协议，将AI工具引入**阿联酋**的学校。在**萨尔瓦多**，**埃隆·马斯克**的AI公司正在开发一个使用**Grock聊天机器人**的辅导系统。在美国，一些最大的学区已经推出了与科技巨头合作的项目。这些公司认为，他们的技术可以促进学习和教学，快速创建测验、分解复杂主题，并帮助撰写课程计划。一些试点项目的教师表示，由于他们的许多学生已经在自己使用AI，将其引入课堂可以让他们有机会教孩子们如何负责任地使用它，而不是盲目信任聊天机器人的说法。但一些健康组织警告说，AI在学校的快速传播可能会带来风险。一项最近的研究发现，流行的聊天机器人可能会削弱批判性思维。**联合国儿童基金会**的一位数字政策专家最近表示，他担心如果没有适当的指导，全球性的推广可能会“积极地削弱”学生和教师的能力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: In the past several months, a push by the tech giants of Silicon Valley to embed artificial intelligence in classrooms has been picking up steam. It's happening around the world, Thailand, Iceland, India. Microsoft has signed a deal to bring AI tools to schools in the UAE. In El Salvador, Elon Musk's AI company is developing a tutoring system using the Grock chatbot. And in the US, some of the country's biggest school systems have introduced their own collaborations with tech giants. The companies argue that their technology can be a boon for learning and teaching, quickly creating quizzes, breaking down complex topics, and helping to write lesson plans. And some teachers in the pilot programs say that since many of their students are already using AI on their own, bringing it into the classroom gives them a chance to teach kids how to use it responsibly and not just blindly trust what chatbots say. But some health groups warned that the rapid spread of AI in schools could pose risks. One recent study found that popular chat bots may diminish critical thinking. And a digital policy expert at UNICEF recently said he was concerned that without proper guidance, the global push could quote actively deskill students and teachers.

### 办公室新趋势：无鞋文化

**Tracy Mumford**: 最后，初创公司总是在引领新的办公室趋势。我们经历过公司提供瑜伽休息、豆袋椅、啤酒畅饮或允许带狗上班的日子。现在，一些初创公司正在推行“无鞋”文化。这一趋势正在小型科技办公室中蔓延。**《纽约时报》**采访的一家AI初创公司为所有访客提供定制拖鞋，让他们进门时换上，而不是穿着街鞋。该公司的首席执行官表示，这让人感觉像家一样，并且“以积极的方式消除隔阂”。她认为这与她从小在家和寺庙里人们脱鞋的习惯一致。一位研究人们工作方式的经济学家称之为“睡衣文化”的体现。基本上，那些在疫情期间养成了舒适居家工作习惯的人们，现在正把这些习惯带回办公室。他说，这也说明了人们在这些初创公司可能工作了多少小时。如果你一天要工作12个小时，一周工作6天，你最好还是舒服点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And finally, startups are always ushering in new office trends. We have lived through the days of companies offering yoga breaks, bean bags for chairs, beer on tap, or bring your dog to work. Now, some startups are going no shoes. The trend is spreading in small tech offices. One AI startup the Times talked with offers all visitors custom slippers to slide on at the door instead of their street shoes. The CEO said it makes it feel like home and quote, "Disarms you in a positive way." and she considers it in keeping with how she grew up with people taking off their shoes at home and in temples. An economist who studies how people work called it pajama culture in action. Basically, people who developed some cozy work from home habits during the pandemic are now bringing those back to the office with them. He said it also speaks to just how many hours people may be working at those startups. If you're going to be there for 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, you might as well be comfortable.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 这实际上并不是科技界第一次出现“露脚趾”的现象。**《纽约时报》**曾在一二十年前采访过几家实行“无鞋”政策的**硅谷**公司。但此后，它们似乎已在很大程度上重新接受了鞋子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: This actually isn't tech's first goaround with showing your toes. The Times checked in with a few Silicon Valley companies who went no shoes a decade ago or more. Since then, they seem to have largely rembraced footwear.

</details>

**>>**: 他选择了市里一个偏僻的地方宣誓就职。你的问题是，他在哪里宣誓就职？答案是：马达尼的就职典礼在一座市政厅下方的旧地铁站举行。该站自1945年以来一直关闭，以其瓷砖拱门、拱形天花板和吊灯而闻名。马达尼说，这是“一座敢于兼具美丽和建造伟大事物以改变工薪阶层生活的城市”的象征。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
