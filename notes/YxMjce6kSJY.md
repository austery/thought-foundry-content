title: “边境沙皇”与5万美元现金丑闻：一起被撤销的FBI调查为何挥之不去？

### 引言：霍曼的5万美元现金丑闻

From The New York Times, I'm Natalie Kitroof. This is The Daily.

这里是《纽约时报》，我是娜塔莉·基特罗夫。这里是《每日》。

The White House **Border Czar** (边境沙皇: 美国总统任命的，负责协调边境安全和移民政策的高级官员) Tom Homeman was recorded on an **FBI** (Federal Bureau of Investigation: 美国联邦调查局，主要负责反恐、反情报、网络犯罪和腐败等案件的调查) surveillance tape in September 2024 accepting $50,000 in cash.

白宫的**边境沙皇**汤姆·霍曼于2024年9月被**联邦调查局**的监控录像记录到收取5万美元现金。

Did he keep that money or give it back?

他把这笔钱留下了，还是退回去了？

For the past few weeks, Trump officials have been asked repeatedly about an undercover FBI investigation of Border Czar Tom Homeman: "What became of the $50,000 in cash that the FBI delivered to Mr. Homeman?"

在过去几周里，特朗普政府官员被反复问及联邦调查局对边境沙皇汤姆·霍曼的卧底调查：“联邦调查局交给霍曼先生的5万美元现金，后来怎么样了？”

And consistently, they've sidestepped, "Did he accept that $50,000 or not, George, I don't know what you're talking about. Did he accept $50,000 for what?"

他们一直回避这个问题，回答说：“他到底收没收那5万美元？乔治，我不知道你在说什么。他收5万美元是为什么？”

Or refused to answer key questions.

或者拒绝回答关键问题。

"Did the FBI get it back? Senator, White House, you're welcome to talk to the FBI about whether one of Trump's top immigration officials brazenly broke the law and what's being done about it."

“联邦调查局拿回去了吗？参议员、白宫，你们大可以去和联邦调查局谈谈，特朗普手下的一位高级移民官员是否公然违法，以及对此采取了什么措施。”

"The White House and the president stand by Tom Homeman 100% because he did absolutely nothing wrong."

“白宫和总统百分之百支持汤姆·霍曼，因为他绝对没有做错任何事。”

Today, my colleague Devlin Barrett on the story behind those questions and why the Tom Homeman scandal hasn't faded away.

今天，我的同事德夫林·巴雷特将讲述这些问题背后的故事，以及为什么汤姆·霍曼的丑闻没有消散。

It's Wednesday, October 15th.

今天是10月15日，星期三。

**Natalie:** Devlin, I've been watching this story of these allegations surrounding Tom Homeman unfold over the past several weeks. And as I've watched, I keep thinking about this interview I did with Homeman on the show in June.

**娜塔莉:** 德夫林，过去几周我一直在关注围绕汤姆·霍曼的这些指控。在关注的过程中，我一直在回想今年6月我在节目中对霍曼的采访。

One thing that really stuck with me from that interview was just how uncompromising Homeman was in the way he presented his view of the law and what should happen to people who break it—that they should be punished.

那次采访中，有一件事让我印象深刻，那就是霍曼在阐述他对法律的看法以及对违法者的处理方式时，是多么的毫不妥协——他认为他们应该受到惩罚。

And I want to just play you a little bit of tape about how he represented himself and that mission.

我想给你播放一段录音，听听他是如何描述自己和这项使命的。

"We're a nation of laws, right? We've got to enforce laws. Entering this country illegally is a crime. We don't pick and choose what we enforce. We're here to enforce the law."

“我们是一个法治国家，对吧？我们必须执行法律。非法进入这个国家是犯罪。我们不会挑选性执法。我们在这里是为了执行法律。”

**Natalie:** And then recently we got some new information about Homeman. Tell us when you first learned about this story.

**娜塔莉:** 然后最近我们又收到了一些关于霍曼的新信息。告诉我们你是何时首次得知这个故事的。

### FBI卧底调查的开端

**Devlin:** So I cover the **Justice Department** (司法部: 美国联邦政府的法律部门，负责执法和司法行政) and the FBI, and months ago I had started hearing rumblings that there had been some kind of bribery investigation related to Tom Homeman. But I couldn't quite figure out what it was about or where it was.

**德夫林:** 我负责报道**司法部**和联邦调查局，几个月前，我开始听到一些传闻，说有一项与汤姆·霍曼有关的贿赂调查。但我一直搞不清楚具体是什么，也找不到它的踪迹。

And for a while, it just was a puzzle I couldn't solve.

有一段时间，这对我来说就是一个解不开的谜团。

**Natalie:** You had a lot of other stories you were covering.

**娜塔莉:** 你当时还有很多其他新闻要报道。

**Devlin:** It's pretty busy at the **DOJ** (Department of Justice: 美国司法部) and the FBI most days.

**德夫林:** 司法部和联邦调查局大部分时间都非常忙碌。

Then sometime in September, I got a little more information where someone knew some of the answers to these questions and said, "Oh, you mean the case with a bag of cash?"

然后大约在9月份的某个时候，我得到了一些更多的信息，有人知道这些问题的一些答案，并说：“哦，你是指那个装有现金袋的案子吗？”

**Natalie:** Whoa. A bag of cash. That's a pretty big tip.

**娜塔莉:** 哇。一个装有现金的袋子。这可是一个相当重要的线索。

**Devlin:** Well, right. That's not what you would think of as, let's call it, regular business practice, right?

**德夫林:** 嗯，没错。那可不是你认为的，姑且称之为，正常的商业操作，对吧？

It's almost the stereotypical way that people think of corruption cases.

这几乎是人们对腐败案件的刻板印象。

**Natalie:** Yeah.

**娜塔莉:** 是的。

**Devlin:** So, from that point, I started putting more pieces together and figuring more things out. I wasn't the only reporter chasing this; MSNBC also figured it out.

**德夫林:** 所以，从那时起，我开始把更多的碎片拼凑起来，弄清楚更多的事情。我不是唯一一个追查此事的记者；MSNBC也发现了。

And so what I eventually came to understand was that there had been, beginning really in 2023 but stretching all the way into this year, a really fascinating investigation that came to include Tom Homeman.

我最终了解到的是，从2023年开始，一直持续到今年，有一项非常引人入胜的调查，最终将汤姆·霍曼也牵扯了进来。

As it's been described to me by sources, if you go back to the spring of 2023, the FBI in Texas was conducting an undercover investigation related to a particular businessman.

据消息人士向我描述，如果回到2023年春天，得克萨斯州的联邦调查局正在对一名特定商人进行卧底调查。

And the investigation, my sources were adamant, was not looking at Tom Homeman at all.

我的消息来源坚称，这项调查根本不是针对汤姆·霍曼的。

But in the course of that investigation, that businessman told the undercover agents that if those agents, who were posing as businessmen looking for government contracts, were willing to pay Tom Homeman a million dollars, he could steer government contracts to them.

但在调查过程中，那位商人告诉卧底探员，如果这些冒充商人寻求政府合同的探员愿意支付汤姆·霍曼一百万美元，他就能为他们争取到政府合同。

**Natalie:** So these agents weren't initially fishing for anything related to Tom Homeman. They weren't looking at him at that time.

**娜塔莉:** 所以这些探员最初并不是在寻找任何与汤姆·霍曼有关的线索。他们当时并没有调查他。

**Devlin:** My sources are adamant that no one had asked about Tom Homeman; that was brought up unprompted, and Tom Homeman just sort of wanders into the picture, wanders into the frame of what the FBI agents are already doing.

**德夫林:** 我的消息来源坚称，没有人问起过汤姆·霍曼；这个名字是不经意间被提起的，汤姆·霍曼就这样不期而至，进入了联邦调查局探员正在进行的调查范围。

### 霍曼的背景与未来预期

**Natalie:** Wow. Just to put us in time here, we're in 2023.

**娜塔莉:** 哇。让我们回到时间点，我们现在是2023年。

We know Tom Homeman as the former **ICE** (Immigration and Customs Enforcement: 美国移民和海关执法局) director in the first Trump administration, this longtime border official.

我们知道汤姆·霍曼是特朗普第一任政府时期前**移民和海关执法局**局长，这位长期从事边境事务的官员。

He actually served in the Obama administration, but he's not in government at this point. Right.

他实际上在奥巴马政府时期也任职过，但目前他不在政府部门工作。对吧。

**Devlin:** Right. He's just a private citizen, and he runs a consulting business for companies that are seeking contracts.

**德夫林:** 没错。他只是一名普通公民，为那些寻求合同的公司经营一家咨询业务。

So, it's not completely out of the blue that he would have some interest in government contracts.

所以，他对政府合同感兴趣并非完全出人意料。

But again, he's not in government at that time. And he's known mostly as a former Trump official who is what they sometimes call a campaign surrogate.

但再次强调，他当时并不在政府部门。他主要以一名前特朗普政府官员的身份为人所知，有时被称为竞选代理人。

He often would appear, speaking publicly in support of another Trump administration.

他经常公开露面，支持特朗普再次执政。

And there's a lot of general expectation that if Trump wins reelection, Homeman will rejoin the government.

而且普遍预期是，如果特朗普赢得连任，霍曼将重返政府。

And in November of 2023, he out and out says it. He says, "I promise President Trump that if he goes back, I go back."

在2023年11月，他明确表示了这一点。他说：“我向特朗普总统承诺，如果他回去，我也会回去。”

And then he added to that, "And I'm going to run the biggest deportation operation this country's ever seen."

然后他又补充道：“我将主导这个国家有史以来最大规模的驱逐行动。”

Right? He's widely seen as a likely member of a future Trump administration.

对吧？他被普遍视为未来特朗普政府的可能成员。

He's saying he's going to be there, and there's this sense that a lot of money is going to be thrown at the area that he's going to be involved in — border enforcement.

他说他会加入政府，而且有一种感觉是，他将参与的边境执法领域会投入大量资金。

**Natalie:** Well, right, that whole time period, the Trump campaign is talking about deporting millions of people.

**娜塔莉:** 嗯，没错，在那个时期，特朗普竞选团队正在谈论驱逐数百万人。

It is a very expensive prospect.

这是一个非常昂贵的计划。

So, there's a natural expectation that there will be significant government contracts related to both border security work and deportation work.

因此，很自然地会预期将有大量与边境安全工作和驱逐工作相关的政府合同。

Okay, so back to the investigation. What happens next?

好的，回到调查。接下来发生了什么？

### 5万美元现金交付与会面

**Devlin:** So once that businessman proposes this notion that the undercover agents could pay Tom Homeman to get government contracts, a series of conversations follow.

**德夫林:** 所以，一旦那位商人提出卧底探员可以向汤姆·霍曼支付报酬以获得政府合同的想法，接下来便进行了一系列的对话。

This investigation goes on for a long time, but eventually a meeting is set up for September 20th, 2024.

这项调查持续了很长时间，但最终定于2024年9月20日举行一次会面。

And at that meeting, my sources tell me, the undercover agents bring $50,000 in cash, and that cash is put in a takeout food bag, a bag from the chain Cava.

我的消息来源告诉我，在那次会面中，卧底探员带来了5万美元现金，这些现金被装在一个外卖袋里，一个来自连锁店Cava的袋子。

**Natalie:** So what has been described to me is that at that meeting, Homeman both accepts the cash and seems to convey that he's willing to help them get contracts in the future.

**娜塔莉:** 那么，据向我描述，在那次会议上，霍曼既接受了现金，也似乎表示他愿意在未来帮助他们获得合同。

Do we know exactly what he says, Devlin? Do we have any specific information about that?

德夫林，我们知道他具体说了什么吗？我们有任何具体信息吗？

**Devlin:** We don't know exactly what he says, and that's obviously a big question in this whole process, but we do know that the FBI agents made an audio recording of the meeting.

**德夫林:** 我们不知道他具体说了什么，这显然是整个过程中一个大问题，但我们确实知道联邦调查局探员对这次会面进行了录音。

So, somewhere in government files, there exists, I am told, an audio recording of this discussion.

所以，据我所知，政府文件中某处存在着这次谈话的录音。

And what's been described to me is that Homeman accepts the cash and leaves.

据我描述，霍曼收下现金后离开了。

**Natalie:** And that's a great start to an investigation. You've got a lot to work with there, right?

**娜塔莉:** 这对一项调查来说是一个很好的开端。你们有很多可以着手的地方，对吧？

Because the person you're investigating has taken the money and appears to have agreed to do things in exchange for the money.

因为你正在调查的人已经收了钱，并且似乎同意为钱做一些事情。

But that's not really the end of the investigation.

但这并不是调查的真正终点。

**Natalie:** Why not?

**娜塔莉:** 为什么不是？

### 调查的复杂性与未竟之处

**Devlin:** For a couple of reasons. One, because there was no very specific act that he agreed to do in exchange for that money. And two, it's important to remember at the time he takes the money, Tom Homeman is still not a government official. He certainly can't make the Biden administration, which was running the government at that time, award contracts. So in the moment the cash is handed over, Homeman really can't deliver, even if he wants to.

**德夫林:** 有几个原因。第一，因为他没有明确同意为这笔钱做什么具体的行为。第二，重要的是要记住，在他收钱的时候，汤姆·霍曼还不是政府官员。他当然不能让当时执政的拜登政府授予合同。所以，在现金交接的那一刻，霍曼即使想，也无法兑现。

**Natalie:** Right. I guess the assumption here is that this is like a down payment for future services that he could potentially render. Correct.

**娜莉塔:** 没错。我猜这里的假设是，这就像是未来他可能提供的服务的预付款。对吗？

**Devlin:** Right. The investigators thought of it as, "This is the start of the relationship. This is the start of the process."

**德夫林:** 没错。调查人员认为这是“关系的开始。这是过程的开始。”

**Natalie:** Devlin, does that help explain a question I've had about all this, which is: $50,000 is a lot of money, but it also doesn't feel like enough for someone like Homeman to do something this risky that could really jeopardize his career, right?

**娜塔莉:** 德夫林，这有助于解释我一直以来的一个疑问吗？那就是：5万美元是一大笔钱，但对于像霍曼这样的人来说，做这种可能真正危及他职业生涯的冒险事情，似乎又不够多，对吧？

It wasn't necessarily that you give him this $50,000 and then he immediately starts doing things for you.

这并不意味着你给他这5万美元，然后他就会立即为你做事。

**Devlin:** One source described it as, "They paid money to make a friend."

**德夫林:** 一位消息人士将其描述为：“他们花钱交了个朋友。”

And in a regular corruption investigation, there would naturally be follow-up meetings, maybe follow-up payments.

在正常的腐败调查中，自然会有后续会议，也许还有后续付款。

**Natalie:** That's certainly a possibility in such an investigation, right? They're playing the long game here.

**娜塔莉:** 在这样的调查中，这当然是一种可能性，对吧？他们在这里玩的是长线。

**Devlin:** Exactly. They have a very strong start to a case. They have very good evidence, and they have a very good basis to proceed with their investigation.

**德夫林:** 没错。他们对案件有一个非常强劲的开端。他们有非常充分的证据，也有非常好的基础来继续他们的调查。

### 特朗普政府的介入与撤案

**Natalie:** And then Trump wins the election, right?

**娜塔莉:** 然后特朗普赢得了选举，对吧？

**Devlin:** And within days of Trump winning the election, the president-elect announces that Tom Homeman will become his Border Czar.

**德夫林:** 特朗普赢得选举的几天内，候任总统宣布汤姆·霍曼将成为他的边境沙皇。

**Natalie:** And not many people know the ins and outs of these Czar positions that government and white houses sometimes announce.

**娜塔莉:** 并不是很多人都了解政府和白宫有时会宣布的这些“沙皇”职位的来龙去脉。

Yeah. I've always wondered, is that a real long-term position in the U.S. government, a Czar?

是的。我一直在想，这在美国政府中是一个真正的长期职位吗，一个“沙皇”？

**Devlin:** It's not something you're nominated for. It's not something that the Senate confirms you for.

**德夫林:** 这不是一个需要被提名才能担任的职位。也不是一个需要参议院确认的职位。

It's very much a point person for an administration on a particular subject.

它更多是政府在特定事务上的一个主要负责人。

But what matters in this instance is that because there's no Senate confirmation, there's not the same kind of background check scrubbing that goes on for a Czar position as there is for a cabinet official or a deputy cabinet official.

但在此事件中重要的是，由于没有参议院的确认，对于“沙皇”职位来说，并没有像内阁官员或副内阁官员那样严格的背景审查。

And that's important in Homeman's situation because there is this underlying outstanding case.

这在霍曼的情况下很重要，因为存在这个尚未解决的潜在案件。

**Natalie:** Are you saying basically that this might have been intentional, that the Trump administration might have nominated Homeman to the Czar position in order to avoid a background check?

**娜塔莉:** 你是说，这可能是有意的，特朗普政府提名霍曼担任“沙皇”职位，是为了避免背景审查吗？

**Devlin:** It's really unclear. But we do know, however, that during the transition, after Trump is elected but before he is sworn into office, federal law enforcement officials notify and essentially warn the incoming administration that this investigation into Tom Homeman exists.

**德夫林:** 这真的不清楚。但我们确实知道，在过渡期间，即特朗普当选后但在宣誓就职前，联邦执法官员通知并实质上警告了即将上任的政府，关于对汤姆·霍曼的这项调查的存在。

**Natalie:** And the Trump Justice Department then does inherit this investigation. Walk us through what they do with it.

**娜塔莉:** 然后特朗普政府的司法部确实接手了这项调查。请告诉我们他们是如何处理的。

**Devlin:** The short answer is they don't do much of anything with it.

**德夫林:** 简而言之，他们几乎没有做任何事。

The senior officials of that administration look at the case, and they don't like it.

该政府的高级官员审阅了此案，他们不喜欢它。

They're very skeptical that this is anything worth pursuing.

他们非常怀疑这是否值得追查。

And this case, that the agents and investigators thought was a very solid case, a very promising start, it just gets closed.

而这个案件，探员和调查员都认为是一个非常扎实的案件，一个非常有希望的开端，就这样被结案了。

We'll be right back.

我们马上回来。

### 政府对丑闻的回应：否认与转嫁

**Natalie:** So Devlin, once this story breaks about the investigation and about the ending of the investigation, what happens? How does the Trump administration respond?

**娜塔莉:** 那么德夫林，一旦关于这项调查以及调查结束的消息传开，会发生什么？特朗普政府如何回应？

Do they explain their decision to drop this case?

他们是否解释了撤销此案的决定？

**Devlin:** So when we ask the Justice Department to explain why this case was closed, the FBI Director Kash Patel and the Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanch said that it was reviewed by agents and prosecutors, and those agents and prosecutors found no credible evidence of any criminal wrongdoing.

**德夫林:** 所以当我们要求司法部解释为什么此案被结案时，联邦调查局局长卡什·帕特尔和副司法部长托德·布兰奇表示，此案经过探员和检察官的审查，而这些探员和检察官没有发现任何可信的刑事不当行为证据。

They basically called it a baseless investigation, and that's why they say they closed it.

他们基本上称之为一项毫无根据的调查，并表示这就是他们结案的原因。

**Natalie:** They don't mention the bag of cash specifically.

**娜塔莉:** 他们没有具体提到那个装有现金的袋子。

**Devlin:** They don't mention the bag of cash, and that becomes a real focal point of all the questions that follow about what the administration did here and why they did it.

**德夫林:** 他们没有提到那个装有现金的袋子，而这成了后续所有关于政府在此事中做了什么以及为什么这么做的问题的真正焦点。

**Natalie:** One of the first very public comments about all this is from the White House press secretary Carolyn Levit.

**娜塔莉:** 关于这一切，最早的公开评论之一来自白宫新闻秘书卡罗琳·莱维特。

"Does Homeman have to return the $50,000?"

“霍曼必须归还那5万美元吗？”

"Well, Mr. Homeman never took the $50,000 that you're referring to, so you should get your facts straight." Denying that he took the money at all.

“嗯，霍曼先生从未拿过你所说的5万美元，所以你应该搞清楚事实。”她完全否认他收了钱。

Hours after that, "Tom, I want to give you a chance to address this article that came out over the weekend."

几个小时后，“汤姆，我想给你一个机会，回应周末刊登的这篇文章。”

Tom Homeman goes on Fox News, and he's given an opportunity to just respond to the reporting, respond to these allegations.

汤姆·霍曼上了福克斯新闻，他有机会直接回应报道，回应这些指控。

And his answer is very telling in one way: he never denies taking the money.

而他的回答在某种程度上非常说明问题：他从未否认收了钱。

"Look, I did nothing criminal. I did nothing illegal. And there's hit piece after hit piece after hit piece."

“听着，我没有做任何犯罪的事。我没有做任何违法的事。而且这种攻击性报道一篇接着一篇。”

He repeats very emphatically that he didn't commit any crime.

他非常强调地重复，他没有犯任何罪。

"And I'm glad the FBI and DOJ came out and said that nothing illegal happened, no criminal activity."

“我很高兴联邦调查局和司法部出来说，没有发生任何违法行为，没有犯罪活动。”

**Natalie:** Yeah. Suddenly, we're talking not about whether this happened or not, but about whether it was legal.

**娜塔莉:** 是的。突然间，我们讨论的不再是这件事是否发生过，而是它是否合法。

And obviously, those two things are very different, right?

很明显，这两件事是非常不同的，对吧？

And so the administration ends up getting very adamant about the point that Homeman makes in his interview on this, which is just to say there was no crime here, and that becomes a kind of mantra throughout the administration as the questions keep coming up.

因此，政府最终非常坚持霍曼在采访中提出的观点，即这里没有犯罪，这在整个政府中成为一种口头禅，随着问题不断出现。

"Do you know sitting here?"

“你坐在这里知道吗？”

"All I know is that Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanch and FBI Director Patel said there was no case."

“我只知道副司法部长托德·布兰奇和联邦调查局局长帕特尔说没有案子。”

**Natalie:** Last week, there was a hearing before the **Senate Judiciary Committee** (参议院司法委员会: 美国参议院的一个常设委员会，负责审查司法提名和立法，包括联邦法院法官和司法部的官员) in which Attorney General Pam Bondi is very confrontational.

**娜塔莉:** 上周，**参议院司法委员会**举行了一场听证会，司法部长帕姆·邦迪在会上表现得非常具有对抗性。

"If you work for me, you would have been fired."

“如果你为我工作，你早就被解雇了。”

She is adamant that no crime was committed, and she basically goes on the attack and just criticizes the lawmakers who are even asking the question.

她坚称没有犯罪发生，并基本上采取了攻击态势，批评那些甚至提出问题的议员。

In the same vein, just this past weekend, the Vice President, JD Vance, is interviewed by ABC's George Stephanopoulos, and he's asked again about Tom Homeman and the bag of cash.

同样地，就在刚刚过去的周末，副总统J.D.万斯接受了ABC乔治·斯蒂芬诺普洛斯的采访，他再次被问及汤姆·霍曼和那袋现金的事情。

"Are you saying that he did not accept the $50,000?"

“你是说他没有接受那5万美元吗？”

Vance's answer is very similar to Bondi's: "The question is, did he do something illegal? And there's absolutely no evidence that Tom Homeman did, which is why he's working in the administration."

万斯的回答与邦迪的非常相似：“问题是，他是否做了违法的事情？而且绝对没有证据表明汤姆·霍曼做了，这就是他仍在政府工作的原因。”

He insists no crime was committed and again goes on the attack for even asking the question.

他坚称没有犯罪发生，并再次攻击那些甚至提出问题的人。

**Natalie:** Of course, this administration dropped the investigation before they could actually prove whether or not a crime was being committed.

**娜塔莉:** 当然，本届政府在他们能够真正证明是否发生了犯罪之前就放弃了调查。

So, Devlin, what do you make of their argument?

那么，德夫林，你对他们的论点怎么看？

### 法律争议：腐败的定义与界限

**Devlin:** So, on a political level, their argument is very simple: "This was a partisan witch hunt generated by the last Democratic administration."

**德夫林:** 那么，在政治层面，他们的论点非常简单：“这是一场由上届民主党政府发起的党派政治迫害。”

The legal argument is actually a little more complicated, and it touches on a lot of things.

法律论点实际上要复杂一些，它涉及很多方面。

First, I would just say not everyone inside the Justice Department has the exact same view about this case.

首先，我想说的是，司法部内部并非所有人对这个案件都有完全相同的看法。

I have talked to people who feel very strongly that it was a very strong case, a chargeable case, a pursuable case, and it's frustrating to those people that the case was dropped.

我曾与一些人交谈过，他们强烈认为这是一个非常强有力的案件，一个可以起诉的案件，一个值得追查的案件，而案件被撤销让他们感到非常沮丧。

I have talked to other people inside the department who have made the argument, "Look, this was a great beginning of a case. We had not finished the case, and it's not a terrific case without more evidence."

我还与其他部门内部的人士交谈过，他们认为：“看，这只是一个案件的良好开端。我们还没有完成这个案件，如果没有更多证据，它就不是一个出色的案件。”

So, there aren't universal views about this even inside the department.

所以，即使在部门内部，对这件事也没有普遍的看法。

But this case also speaks to what's really a long-running disagreement about whether or not the Justice Department is overusing and stretching corruption laws beyond what they were intended to do.

但这个案件也反映了一个长期存在的争议，即司法部是否过度使用和扩大了腐败法律的适用范围，使其超出了最初的意图。

And over a number of years, the Supreme Court has basically whittled away at how federal corruption laws can be used and has repeatedly sent a signal to the Justice Department that certainly the conservatives on the court believe that the Justice Department is in many cases misusing or overusing corruption statutes to go after politicians.

多年来，最高法院基本上削弱了联邦腐败法律的使用方式，并多次向司法部发出信号，即法院中的保守派肯定认为司法部在许多案件中滥用或过度使用腐败法规来追究政治家的责任。

**Natalie:** Meaning there's a disagreement within the legal community about what actually constitutes corruption, or at least what's the threshold for proving it in court.

**娜塔莉:** 也就是说，在法律界内部，对于究竟什么构成腐败，或者至少在法庭上证明腐败的门槛是什么，存在分歧。

**Devlin:** Well, exactly. And one of the ways that this case gets argued about among lawyers is there's something called **Stream of Benefits Corruption** (利益流腐败: 一种法律理论，认为腐败行为不一定需要明确的“交换条件”，只要存在持续的利益输送和非官方回报关系即可构成腐败) which makes the argument that you don't need a very explicit **quid pro quo** (交换条件: 指“你给我什么，我给你什么”这种直接的利益交换关系).

**德夫林:** 嗯，没错。律师们讨论这个案子的一种方式是，有一种叫做**利益流腐败**的理论，它主张你不需要一个非常明确的**交换条件**。

You don't need a very explicit "you give me X dollars, and I will do Y for you," Sopranos-style, right?

你不需要一个非常明确的“你给我X美元，我就会为你做Y”，就像《黑道家族》里那样，对吧？

What you can have is a sort of corrupt flow relationship where I do the following things for you, like cash, and you in exchange do the following things for me, like official favors, like getting contracts, but the court has to believe that it's explicit.

你可以拥有一种腐败的利益流动关系，即我为你做以下事情，比如给现金，而你作为交换为我做以下事情，比如提供官方便利，像获得合同，但法院必须相信这是明确的。

It can't just be a vague set of actions.

它不能只是一系列模糊的行为。

That's the argument for how you could charge a case like this.

这就是如何起诉这类案件的论点。

### 丑闻挥之不去的原因：现金袋与录音带

**Natalie:** So, there are obviously a lot of open legal questions here, and maybe what the FBI had in its hands wasn't an open and shut case yet.

**娜塔莉:** 所以，这里显然有很多悬而未决的法律问题，也许联邦调查局掌握的证据还不足以构成一个板上钉钉的案件。

But Homeman taking this money as a lawman, as the chief spokesman of this administration's immigration policy, it does raise all sorts of questions, and the administration not following up also raises questions.

但霍曼作为一名执法者，作为本届政府移民政策的主要发言人，收取这笔钱确实引发了各种疑问，而政府没有进行后续调查也同样引发了疑问。

I guess what I'm wondering, Devlin, is there have been so many similar scandals swirling around the Trump administration at this point.

德夫林，我猜我在想的是，到目前为止，特朗普政府周围已经充斥着太多类似的丑闻。

Allegations of corruption from crypto to the free airplane.

从加密货币到免费飞机，各种腐败指控不绝于耳。

A lot of those have kind of faded away in the fire hose of news that we are all experiencing on a day-to-day basis.

其中很多都在我们日常经历的新闻洪流中逐渐淡去。

But this one has kind of outlived the Trump news cycle. Why?

但这个丑闻却似乎比特朗普的新闻周期更长久。为什么？

**Devlin:** I mean, look, as someone who covers the Justice Department and the FBI, I will tell you that there are many corruption cases that are hard to follow, hard to explain, hard to just unravel and unpack.

**德夫林:** 听着，作为一个报道司法部和联邦调查局的记者，我告诉你，有很多腐败案件很难追踪，很难解释，也很难理清和分析。

Crypto isn't an easy thing to explain.

加密货币就不是一个容易解释的东西。

**Natalie:** Sure.

**娜塔莉:** 当然。

**Devlin:** You know what is easy to explain? A bag full of cash. That's pretty simple.

**德夫林:** 你知道什么容易解释吗？一袋现金。这很简单。

Why did he take a bag of cash? What did he do with the cash?

他为什么拿一袋现金？他用这笔钱做了什么？

And in addition to how simple a bag of cash is, we know from the reporting that an audio tape exists somewhere, right?

除了一个现金袋有多么简单明了之外，我们从报道中得知，某个地方存在着一份录音带，对吧？

And that tape could be released.

而那份录音带可能会被公布。

People could start demanding its release, right?

人们可能会开始要求公布它，对吧？

So if you think for a minute about the Jeffrey Epstein case, obviously the Tom Homeman case is not the Jeffrey Epstein case.

所以如果你想一想杰弗里·爱泼斯坦的案件，很明显汤姆·霍曼的案件不是杰弗里·爱泼斯坦的案件。

Epstein is a completely different type of case with a completely different history.

爱泼斯坦是一个完全不同类型的案件，有着完全不同的历史。

**Natalie:** Yep. But the demand to release the Tom Homeman tape is in some ways very similar to the demands to release the Epstein files because it's a simple, straightforward question, and when you are told no, it begs the question, "Well, why is the answer no?"

**娜塔莉:** 是的。但要求公布汤姆·霍曼录音带的要求，在某些方面与要求公布爱泼斯坦文件的要求非常相似，因为它是一个简单、直接的问题，当你被告知不能公布时，就会引出一个问题：“为什么答案是否定的？”

Can I just ask, do we know what happened to the money, the $50,000?

我能问一下吗，那5万美元的钱后来怎么样了？我们知道吗？

**Devlin:** We really don't. A lot of what you've seen since the initial reporting is people trying to figure out the answer to that question, but the administration really won't tell us, and Homeman so far hasn't told us.

**德夫林:** 我们真的不知道。自最初报道以来，你所看到的很多情况都是人们试图找出这个问题的答案，但政府真的不肯告诉我们，霍曼到目前为止也没有告诉我们。

So the case may be dead, but I think what hasn't died is people's desire to know the answer to that question.

所以这个案子可能已经结了，但我认为人们想知道那个问题答案的愿望并没有消亡。

So I think for the foreseeable future, wherever Tom Homeman goes, he's going to be asked that question.

所以我认为在可预见的未来，无论汤姆·霍曼走到哪里，他都会被问到那个问题。

"What did you do with the money?"

“你把钱怎么样了？”

**Natalie:** Well, Devlin, thanks so much for coming on the show.

**娜塔莉:** 好的，德夫林，非常感谢你来到节目。

**Devlin:** Thanks for having me.

**德夫林:** 谢谢邀请。

We'll be right back.

我们马上回来。

### 今日要闻：委内瑞拉海域袭击与阿根廷援助

Here's what else you should know today.

以下是您今天还需要了解的其他消息。

On Tuesday, President Trump announced that the U.S. had killed six men aboard a boat off the coast of Venezuela, the fifth known strike on a boat in the Caribbean Sea since September.

周二，特朗普总统宣布，美国在委内瑞拉海岸附近的一艘船上击毙了六名男子，这是自9月以来在加勒比海域已知的第五次针对船只的袭击。

He said the men had been transporting drugs, but provided no evidence to support that claim.

他说这些男子一直在运输毒品，但没有提供证据支持这一说法。

And while he posted a video of the attack, the president offered no details about the nationality of the suspects and didn't identify them as belonging to any particular criminal group.

尽管他发布了袭击视频，但总统没有提供关于嫌疑人国籍的任何细节，也没有指明他们属于任何特定的犯罪集团。

The U.S. military has now killed 27 people in these boat attacks, treating them as if they were enemy soldiers in the middle of a war zone rather than criminal suspects.

美国军方目前已在这些船只袭击中杀死了27人，对待他们如同战区中的敌方士兵，而非犯罪嫌疑人。

"And it's a great honor to have the leader of Argentina, a place that I love, I've been to, and one of the most beautiful places in the world. President, I really want to thank you very much."

“非常荣幸能邀请到阿根廷领导人，那是一个我热爱的地方，我去过，也是世界上最美丽的地方之一。总统，我真的非常感谢您。”

Trump hosted Argentinian President Javier Milei at the White House on Tuesday, just days after the U.S. agreed to move ahead with a $20 billion bailout of Argentina.

周二，特朗普在白宫接待了阿根廷总统哈维尔·米莱，就在几天前，美国同意推进对阿根廷的200亿美元救助计划。

"We think he's going to win. He should win. And if he does win, we're going to be very helpful."

“我们认为他会赢。他应该赢。如果他赢了，我们将会非常乐于提供帮助。”

"And if he doesn't win, we're not going to waste our time because you have somebody whose philosophy has no chance of making Argentina great again."

“如果他没赢，我们也不会浪费时间，因为你们会有一个思想理念根本无法让阿根廷再次伟大的人。”

Trump explicitly tied U.S. economic support for the country to the political fortunes of Milei, who's trying to stave off a financial meltdown at home and whose party is facing tough midterm elections this month.

特朗普明确将美国对该国的经济支持与米莱的政治命运挂钩，米莱正试图阻止国内的金融崩溃，其政党本月也面临艰难的中期选举。

Trump acknowledged that the bailout was intended to support the Argentinian leader's fiscally conservative policies and wouldn't make a big difference for the U.S.

特朗普承认，这项救助旨在支持这位阿根廷领导人的财政保守政策，对美国来说不会产生太大影响。
