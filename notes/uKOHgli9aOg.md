title: 市场周报：区域银行风险、经济现状与黄金白银的抛物线式上涨

### 市场概览与政府停摆影响

大家好，今天是10月18日，这里是《市场周报》。过去一周市场波动剧烈，但如果将时间拉长到过去几个月，股市似乎只会上涨，而现在则出现了双向风险，有时也会下跌。这或许表明市场情绪有所转变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello my friends. Today is October 18th and this is Markets Weekly. So this past week was a pretty volatile week in markets, but if you zoom out a bit and see that, you know, over the past few months, the equity market could only go up, but now it looks like there's some two-sided risk. Sometimes it goes down. So maybe a little bit of a change in the mood of the market.</p>
</details>

本周，我们仍处于政府停摆状态，因此没有任何官方数据。博彩市场预测停摆可能会持续到11月深处。因此，我们可能在一段时间内都无法获得数据，更令人担忧的是，如果没人工作，就没有人收集数据。所以，即使政府重新开放，我们可能也无法真正获得任何官方数据。这意味着我们将在一段时间内“盲飞”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now this week, we're still in a government shutdown, so we don't have any official data. The betting markets are suggesting that the shutdown could go deep into November. So maybe we won't have data for some time and concerningly if no one's working, no one's collecting the data. So even when the government opens, we might not really get any official data. So we're going to be flying blind for some time today.</p>
</details>

今天，我们来谈三件事。首先，我们必须讨论上周发生的区域银行恐慌，当时信贷担忧导致几家区域银行股票遭到大幅抛售。其次，我们将审视一些私人数据，以了解经济可能走向何方。最后，我们必须谈谈黄金和白银的抛物线式上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Let's talk about three things. First off, we have to talk about the regional bank scare that we had the past week where credit concerns were prompting a pretty big sale of a couple regional banks. Secondly, let's look at some private data to see where the economy might be heading. And lastly, we have to talk about the parabolic ascent of gold and silver.</p>
</details>

### 区域银行恐慌与信贷质量评估

好的，我们从区域银行开始。如果你看一下区域银行股票的价格指数，你会发现它们经历了一次下跌。事情是这样的：有报道称几家区域银行不得不减记向一个亏损的投资基金发放的部分贷款，导致这些银行的股票被大幅抛售。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, starting with the regional banks. So, if you look at this price index of regional bank stocks, you can see that there was kind of a tumble. So what happened was that a couple regional banks got sold significantly because there were reports that they had to write down some of their loans made to an investment fund that lost money.</p>
</details>

这种情况发生在一个更广泛的背景下，即信贷市场似乎对信贷质量存在更多担忧，认为其可能不如定价所暗示的那么好。因此，**信贷利差**（Credit Spreads: 衡量债券风险的指标，即风险债券与无风险债券之间的收益率差）仍然相当紧张。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now this is occurring uh during a broader context where there seems to be a little bit more concern in the credit markets about uh you know maybe credit is not as good quality as as the pricing suggests. So credit spreads are still pretty tight.</p>
</details>

过去几个月，我们看到两家相当大的公司破产。一家是专门向非法移民提供贷款的公司，另一家是**First Brands**（一家在汽车零部件业务中占有很大份额的公司）。这两家公司都是私营企业，因此没有相同的公开披露信息，但很容易将它们的失败视为**特异性事件**（Idiosyncratic: 指特定于某个个体或情境，而非普遍性的）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, in the past few months, we've had the bankruptcies of two pretty large companies. We had, which was a company that basically specialized in lending uh to illegal immigrants, and also First Brands, which was a company that uh had a lot of business in auto parts. Now, those two companies are both privately held, so there they don't have the same public disclosures, but it's easy to see them as idiosyncratic.</p>
</details>

当然，当谈到移民政策时，总统正在执行不同的移民法，所以当你的客户被驱逐出境时，这显然不利于业务。至于First Brands，存在一些潜在欺诈的指控，而企业界总是存在欺诈行为。所以，这两起失败可能只是特异性事件，或者它们可能预示着更深层次的系统性问题。考虑到这种不确定性，当有报道称这些区域银行亏损时，市场表现得非常紧张。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when it comes toricolor of course the president has a uh different immigration policy he's enforcing immigration law now and so you know when your clients are getting deported obviously that's not going to be good for business when it comes to first brands there's some allegations of potential fraud and there's always fraud in the corporate space right so you know maybe these two failures could just be idiosyncratic or you know maybe they're systemic of something that's a lot deeper and so with that cloud in mind the market was very jumpy when it came to reports that uh these regional banks had lost some money.</p>
</details>

但过去一周也是银行财报发布的重要一周。因此，我们可以退一步，从更广阔的视角来看是否存在系统性风险。也许存在大量不良贷款，或者这些只是真正的特异性事件，而市场反应有些过于敏感。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But over this past week was also a very big week for bank earnings. So we can take a step back and we can kind of look broadly to see whether or not there's a systemic risk. Maybe there's a whole bunch of bad loans or maybe these are just really idiosyncratic events and the market is getting a bit too jumpy.</p>
</details>

首先，我们从大型银行开始。显然，如果你是一家银行，你拥有大量数据。很多人在你这里有存款账户，你发放贷款。因此，你对市场脉搏了如指掌。看看**美国银行**（Bank of America），你会发现他们表示信贷质量非常好，实际上还在改善，对吗？那么，他们是一家庞大的银行，但再次强调，这只是一家银行。如果问题只存在于区域银行呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now first let's start with the mega banks. Obviously if you are a bank you have tremendous amounts of data. A lot of people have deposing accounts with you. You make loans. So, you have your finger on the pulse. Now, looking at Bank of America, you can see that, you know, they're saying credit quality is is really good. It's actually improving, right? So, they're a huge ginormous bank and but again, there's just one bank. What if it's just something in the regional banks?</p>
</details>

那么，如果我们看看大型区域银行，比如**Truist**，它们在财报演示中说了什么？你会发现它们也说了同样的话：信贷质量不仅良好，而且正在改善。贷款损失准备金正在下降，冲销也在减少。那么**美国合众银行**（US Bank）呢？这家大型区域银行也说了同样的话。实际上，所有区域银行和大型银行都说了同样的话：到目前为止，银行体系的信贷质量似乎正在改善。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, if we look at the large regional banks, let's say Truest, what are they saying in their earnings presentation? You can see they're saying the same thing. credit quality is not just fine but it's getting better. Loan loss reserves coming down, charge offs also declining. Uh what about uh US Bank also a large regional bank saying the same thing and actually uh basically all the regional banks are saying the same thing as are the big banks. Credit quality so far in the banking system appears to be uh improving.</p>
</details>

现在需要注意的一点是，在大金融危机之后，银行体系的结构发生了显著变化，以至于当我们确实出现信贷问题时，它们极不可能来自银行业。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now one thing to keep in note keep in mind is that after the great financial crisis the structure of the banking system has changed significantly such that when we do have credit issues they're really unlikely to come from the banking sector.</p>
</details>

### 影子银行的崛起与风险转移

在大金融危机中，银行发放了大量不良贷款，这些不良贷款导致它们损失惨重，进而引发了银行危机，并最终演变为一场巨大的金融危机。监管机构不希望这种情况再次发生，因为消费者和家庭将银行存款视为安全资产，尽管从技术上讲它们并非完全安全，你实际上是在向银行提供无担保贷款。但当人们把钱存入银行时，他们认为这是安全的。因此，当银行业出现问题时，就会引发恐慌。所以，监管机构出台了所有这些规定，以确保银行变得更加保守。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So in the great financial crisis the banks made a whole bunch of bad loans and those bad loans caused them to lose a lot of money which in turn caused a banking crisis that basically morphed into a great financial crisis. The regulators don't want that to happen because consumers, households view bank deposits as safe assets, even though technically they're not safe. You're lending unsecured to a bank. But when people put money in a bank, they think of it as safe. And so when you have issues in the banking sector, that causes panics. So they put on all these regulations to make sure that banks became much more conservative.</p>
</details>

因此，如今很多贷款实际上是通过所谓的**影子银行**（Shadow Banks: 指从事类似银行信贷业务，但不受传统银行监管的金融机构）进行的。举例来说，在大金融危机之前，商业银行发放了大量抵押贷款。而如今，大多数抵押贷款实际上是由并非银行的抵押贷款公司发起的，这些公司基本上是私人金融公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So today a lot of lending actually happens um through the what they call shadow banks. So for example before the great financial crisis the commercial banks made a whole bunch of mortgages. Today most mortgages are actually originated from mortgage lending companies that are not banks that are just basically private financial companies.</p>
</details>

同样的情况也适用于许多其他领域。假设你是一家中型市场公司。如果你想获得贷款，你可以去找银行，但现在你也可以越来越多地去找私人投资者，比如私人信贷基金，并在那里获得贷款。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you can say similarly with many other things right. So uh let's say that you are a middle market company. If you want to get a loan, you could go to a bank, but increasingly you or you could go to a private investor like a private uh credit fund and get a loan there.</p>
</details>

如果你看看过去一年银行贷款增长的图表，你会发现商业银行的巨额贷款增长并非流向企业，而是流向了所谓的**非银行金融机构**（Non-Bank Financial Institutions: 指不接受存款，但提供其他金融服务的机构）。确切地说，是非存款性金融机构，基本上就是那些不是银行的金融公司。如果你看那张图表，你会看到一个巨大的跳跃。其中一部分是由于重新分类。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um if you look at this chart of bank loan growth over the past year, you can see that a tremendous amount of loan growth from the commercial banks is not to say uh corporations, but it's to what's called uh non non uh non-bank financial institutions. Well, non-depository financial institutions, basically financial companies that are not banks. And if you look at that chart, you can see there's a big jump. Part of it was because of a reclassification.</p>
</details>

总之，银行喜欢向这些私人金融公司放贷，然后这些私人金融公司再向实体经济放贷。因此，如今很多银行贷款都是间接进行的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So in any case, banks like to lend to these private financial companies and then these private financial companies then lend to the real economy. So a lot of bank lending today is done indirectly.</p>
</details>

因此，当出现信贷问题时，比如说一家公司无法偿还债务，这会成为影子银行或私人非银行贷款机构的问题，然后私人贷款机构将不得不处理。在问题上升到银行层面之前，私人贷款机构必须耗尽其资源。因此，这为商业银行增加了一层额外的安全保障。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so when there are credit problems, let's say a company can't pay, it's a problem for the shadow bank for the private non-bank lender and then the private mom lender will have to deal with it. Now before it goes up to the bank level, the private lender is going to have to exhaust their resources. And so it's an extra layer of safety for the commercial banks.</p>
</details>

因此，商业银行向**黑石集团**（Blackstone）或**保罗资本**（Polo Capital，假设为金融机构）这样的机构放贷，这些基本上是复杂而老练的金融赞助商，然后由他们管理的信贷基金再去进行贷款。因此，在我个人看来，受监管的银行业出现信贷问题的可能性非常小，仅仅是因为大部分风险已经转移到了私人领域。在私人领域可能会出现一些问题，但至少到目前为止，我们看到一些公开交易的**业务发展公司**（BDCs: Business Development Companies: 专注于投资中小型私营公司的公开交易投资公司）表现不佳，但总体看来尚可。所以，我们姑且拭目以待。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So the commercial banks, they're lending to, let's say, a Blackstone or a Polo, basically these, you know, fancy sophisticated uh financial sponsors and then the credit funds managed by these guys then go and do the lending. So it's in my personal view very unlikely for there to be any credit problems in the regulated banking sector uh simply because so much of the risk has basically been moved to the private space and there you could have some issues but so far at least uh you see a little bit of that with the with the public traded business developed corporations the BDC's not having a good uh quarter but so far it seems Okay. So, we'll guess we'll watch that going forward.</p>
</details>

### 经济现状：私人数据与劳动力-GDP悖论

好的。接下来我们要讨论的是经济状况。我们没有任何公开收集的数据，而且可能要到11月深处才能获得。谁知道呢，也许政府更喜欢这样。但我们确实有一些私人数据来源提供的线索，可以了解经济的运行状况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. The next thing we want to talk about is the state of the economy. So, we don't have any publicly collected data and probably won't have it until deep into November. And who knows, maybe the government prefers it this way. Um, but we do have some clues from some private data sources as to how the economy is doing.</p>
</details>

当然，我们首先要看大型银行。正如我之前提到的，大型银行掌握着经济的脉搏。但我们来听听**摩根大通**（JP Morgan）的看法，它是所有银行中最大的，拥有关于实体经济最多数据的一家。在财报电话会议上被问及消费者状况时，摩根大通基本上表示消费者状况良好，一切都很好，他们没有看到任何压力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Of course, we want to go first to the mega banks. The mega banks, like I mentioned earlier, have their finger on the pulse of the economy. But let's hear it from JP Morgan, the biggest bank of the them all, the one with the most uh I guess most data on the real economy. When asked about the state of the consumer on their earnings call, JP Morgan basically said the consumer is fine. Everything is okay. They don't really see any stresses.</p>
</details>

而且，如果你看看**美国运通**（American Express）的信用卡消费数据，你也会得到同样的结论：信用卡消费有所增长。需要明确的是，美国运通和摩根大通可能服务于消费者市场中更富裕的阶层。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And you know if you look at say card spending data from American Express you'll also get the same picture as well. Card spending is up. Now to be clear American Express and maybe JP Morgan probably has a more affluent slice of the consumer market.</p>
</details>

但我们上周也收到了**美联储褐皮书**（Fed's Beige Book: 美国联邦储备系统发布的经济状况报告，每八周发布一次，提供对当前经济状况的定性评估）。因此，即使政府停摆，美联储仍在继续工作。他们所做的一件事就是与行业内的所有联系人交谈，试图定性地了解企业的运营状况。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But we also got the Fed's beige book last week. So even as the government shut down the Fed continues to work. And one of the things they do is they go and they talk to all their contacts in industry and try to get a qualitative sense as to how the businesses are performing.</p>
</details>

根据褐皮书，经济状况，你知道，不算太好也不算太坏。它基本上处于一种“停滞速度”（stall speed）状态。因此，褐皮书表明招聘活动不活跃，但也没有出现大规模裁员。富裕阶层的消费支出良好，而较不富裕阶层的消费支出则不那么理想，但总体而言，经济仍然处于停滞速度。这与过去几个月的情况基本一致。所以，看起来目前为止经济状况没有恶化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now according to the beige book the economy is you know it's not great but it's not bad. It's basically uh just kind of um install speed right now. So the beige book suggests that you know hiring is is is low but you know there's not like a huge amount of firing. Consumer spending among the affluent, good among the less affluent, not as great, but you know, it's it's still basically at stall speed. So that's kind of consistent with what's been happening over the past few months. So looks like it hasn't deteriorated so far.</p>
</details>

但我认为目前经济领域最大的谜团是劳动力数据与**GDP增长**（Gross Domestic Product Growth: 国内生产总值增长，衡量经济产出增长率）之间的背离。看看**亚特兰大联储**（Atlanta Fed），亚特兰大联储仍然在运作。他们的**GDP Now**（GDP Now: 亚特兰大联储实时预测美国GDP增长率的模型）估值非常高，根据他们的GDP估算，一切都在蓬勃发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I think the biggest puzzle when it comes to the economy right now is the divergence between the labor data and GDP growth. Now when you look at the Atlanta Fed, uh again Atlanta Field still works. Their GDP now estimates are really high according to their GDP estimates everything is booming.</p>
</details>

现在你可以看看股市，也许能从中得出一些结论。但众所周知，股市并非经济本身。坦白说，随着时间的推移，两者之间的关联度越来越低。但与此同时，我们也知道招聘速度缓慢。那么，在没有更多劳动力的情况下，如何实现强劲的GDP增长呢？为了生产更多的商品和服务，你需要更多的人工作。因此，这是一种困境，我认为这是当前经济领域的热门话题，也是美联储正在努力解决的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now you can look at the stock market and maybe draw some conclusions there. But as we all know, the stock market is not the economy. It's honestly less and less related as time goes on. But at the same time, we also know that hiring is slow. So how can you have strong GDP growth when you're not having more workers, right? In order to produce more goods and services, you have to have more people working. So this is kind of a conundrum that I think is is the topic duour when it comes to the economy and also what the Fed is struggling as well.</p>
</details>

如果你是一个乐观主义者，你可能会说，也许存在巨大的生产力提升，可能是由于**人工智能**（AI: Artificial Intelligence: 模拟人类智能的机器系统）导致的，这使得公司在不增加劳动力的情况下变得更具生产力。尽管我想指出，有很多轶事证据表明，人工智能对大多数公司来说，实际上并没有带来超高的生产力提升，它可能在编码方面有所帮助，但工程师们也表示，他们需要花费大量时间来修复人工智能中的错误。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you're an optimist, you could say that maybe there's this huge productivity boost maybe due to AI that's causing companies to be much more productive without growing their labor force. Although I would point out that there are a lot of anecdotes that suggest that AI actually isn't really super productivity enhancing for most companies probably helps a bit in coding but then uh they also say that uh the engineers have to spend a lot of time to fix the bugs in the AI.</p>
</details>

因此，这些数据测量中有一个是错误的。要么GDP过高，要么劳动力市场没有人们想象的那么糟糕。所以，我们可能需要一段时间才能弄清楚这一点，因为目前没有官方数据，而且再次强调，也许当局就喜欢这种状态。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So uh one of these data measurements is wrong. Either GDP is too high or labor market is not as bad as people think. So this is something we'll find out probably not for some time since there's no official data and again maybe maybe the authorities like it that way.</p>
</details>

### 黄金白银的抛物线式上涨及其驱动因素

好的，我们要谈的最后一件事是黄金和白银的**抛物线式上涨**（Parabolic Ascent: 价格或价值在短时间内急剧加速上涨，形成类似抛物线的走势）。如果你是我的作品的订阅者，你会知道我有一个市场观点投资组合。基本上，今年我们没有股票敞口，但黄金的权重约为50%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, the last thing we want to talk about is the parabolic ascent of gold and silver. Now if you are a subscriber to to my work, you know that I have a market view portfolio. The whole year basically we had no equities exposure but we did have about 50% weight in gold.</p>
</details>

今年早些时候这听起来很奇怪，但希望今天听起来没那么奇怪了。黄金基本上呈抛物线式上涨，远远跑赢了股市。当然，它的“小兄弟”白银也一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now that sounded very strange earlier in the year, but hopefully a little bit less strange today. Gold has basically gone parabolic, far outperforming the equity market. And of course, it's little brother silver has as well.</p>
</details>

我认为这实际上非常好，因为我很高兴黄金上涨，但我也认为这非常令人担忧。当事物缓慢上涨时，那很好，你知道，稳扎稳打才能赢得比赛。但一旦达到这种抛物线式上涨，它就不会横向调整。抛物线式上涨通常会剧烈向下修正。而且，你也不知道修正何时结束，或者抛物线式上涨何时停止。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, I think this is actually really good because I'm happy that gold is going up, but I think it's also really worrying. Uh when things go up slowly, that's great. you know, slow and steady wins the race. But once you reach this kind of parabolic ascent, you know, it doesn't really correct sideways. The parabolic asense usually correct violently downwards. And also, you don't really know uh when these when the correction ends or when the parabolic ascent stops.</p>
</details>

如果你放大来看白银，你会发现几十年来它一直都在上涨，但每次直线上涨之后，也都会直线下跌。黄金在某种程度上也是如此。那么，黄金这次大涨的驱动因素是什么呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, if you zoom out and look at silver, for example, you can see throughout the decades, it's just gone straight up, but every time it's gone straight up, it's also gone straight down. And to some extent gold does this as well. So what are the drivers for this huge rally in gold.</p>
</details>

老实说，在牛市中，每个人都是天才。每个人都有自己关于价格上涨原因的理论，当他们看到价格上涨时，他们就认为自己的理论是正确的，然后他们觉得自己像个天才，于是买入更多。但归根结底，这真的是黄金上涨的原因吗？我们上次谈到非常流行的**贬值交易**（Debasement Trade: 指投资者预期货币价值将因通货膨胀或政府政策而下降，从而买入黄金等硬资产以保值的行为），认为黄金上涨是因为美元正在贬值，最终将归零。但话又说回来，通货膨胀率在3%或更高，一个更好的市场信号是10年期国债收益率大约在4%左右。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know honestly in a bull market everyone is a genius. So everyone has their theories as to why the price goes up and then when they see the price goes up they think their theory is correct and then they say and then they feel like a genius and they buy more. But at the end of the day you know is that really why gold is going up? So again we talked about last time the debasement trade very popular gold is going up because the dollar is uh you know depreciating debasing going to zero but then again inflation is at 3% or more a better market signal would be uh the 10-year Treasury yield right around 4%.</p>
</details>

如果美元正在大规模贬值，如果通货膨胀极其严重，你不会预期10年期国债收益率只有4%，对吗？所以，这种贬值论调显然是无稽之谈。但相信这一点的人，你知道，他们买入黄金，黄金价格上涨，他们觉得自己很聪明，也许会买入更多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you were having a massive dollar view basement, if you were having a tremendous amount of inflation, you would not expect a 10-year yield to be at 4%, right? So, this this basement stuff is obvious nonsense. But people who believe that, you know, they're buying gold, gold prices go up, they feel smart, maybe they buy more.</p>
</details>

另一个流行的说法是，世界上可能存在巨大的地缘政治风险，但到目前为止，中东战争的风险似乎正在降低。除此之外，总统似乎想再次与**普京总统**（President Putin）对话。因此，地缘政治风险未来也可能出现缓和。所以，这似乎也不太可能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, another popular narrative is that, you know, maybe there's tremendous amounts of geopolitical risk in the world, but so far it looks like Middle East war risk is going lower. And in addition to that, it looks like the president wants to speak with President Putin again. So maybe there's a potential future deescalation in geopolitical risk as well. So that doesn't seem likely as well.</p>
</details>

所以归根结底，这只是**动量**（Momentum: 资产价格在一段时间内持续上涨或下跌的趋势），基本上是当今许多资产的驱动因素。价格上涨，所以你买入更多，你加杠杆，你再次买入更多。这可能就是为什么会出现像我们周五看到的那种剧烈反应，特别是白银，出现了突然下跌。当人们加杠杆时，他们会变得贪婪，进一步加杠杆，这使得市场更加波动和脆弱。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So at the end of the day, this is just momentum basically what drives a lot of assets today. Price goes up, so you buy more, you lever up, you buy more again. And that's probably why you can have these violent reactions like we saw on Friday where you had kind of a sudden tumble, especially in silver. Whereas people become levered um they feel greedy, lever up more and that makes it more volatile and more fragile.</p>
</details>

现在我要指出另一件事是，在过去几年里，很多人评论说黄金表现不佳，可能是因为许多原本会购买黄金的人，那些担心财政不可持续性并希望持有“硬资产”的人，转而购买了**加密货币**（Crypto: Cryptocurrencies: 一种使用密码学原理来确保交易安全及控制交易单位创建的数字或虚拟货币）。现在，如果你看看**比特币**（Bitcoin: 最早且最知名的加密货币）的价格，今年大部分时间它表现不错，但过去几个月它基本上原地踏步。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now one other thing that I'll note is that uh over the past few years uh a lot of people have commented that you know maybe that gold is not doing not performing as well because a lot of people who would buy gold people who are afraid of let's say the fiscal unsustainability who want to have quote unquote hard assets are instead buying crypto. Now, if you look at the price of Bitcoin now, it did well uh for most of this year, but over the past few months, it just really hasn't gone anywhere.</p>
</details>

老实说，它似乎正在走低。有报道称，上周很多人都加了高杠杆，损失惨重。因此，如果人们对比特币感到失望，也许其中一些人会回到黄金市场，而黄金到目前为止表现确实非常好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And and honestly, it looks like it's trending lower. And reports suggest that a lot of people were really levered last week. A lot of lost a lot of money. And so, if Bitcoin, if they're souring on Bitcoin, maybe some of those guys will go back to gold, which actually has performed very well uh so far.</p>

但无论如何，你知道，当价格呈抛物线式上涨时，你不知道它能涨多高，但最终我认为存在大幅回调的重大风险。我并不是说周五的情况就是如此，那看起来还算温和。但这种回调很可能会在未来发生。所以，有理由保持谨慎。但再次强调，我并不是说它会看跌，因为你真的不知道抛物线能涨多高。好的。这就是我今天准备的所有内容。非常感谢您的收听，我们下周再聊。

<p class="english-text">Uh but in any case, you know, when you're going parabolic, you don't know how high you can go, but ultimately uh I think there's there's significant risk of a sharp pullback. And I'm not saying that Friday was the case. That actually seemed kind of mild. Um but that is probably coming going forward. So it's reason to be cautious. But again, not telling you it's bearish because you don't really know how high the parabola can go. All right. So that's all I prepared for today. Thanks so much for tuning in and I'll talk to you guys next week.</p>
