AMD Rallies, Dell Gains, Fair Isaac Tumbles on Rival Equifax's Services | Stock Movers

The Stock Movers Report, your roundup of companies making moves in the stock market, harnessing the power of Bloomberg data.

《股市风云榜》节目，为您梳理股市动态，利用彭博数据洞悉市场脉搏。

Let's look at what's going on in the markets. We're joined here by Christina Kino, of course, Bloomberg News. Here we're going to talk about some of the stocks that are really moving under the hood as we're seeing a day full of optimism green all across the screen. What are you watching, Christine?

让我们来看看市场动态。现在我们有彭博社的克里斯蒂娜·基诺加入。今天，我们将讨论一些正在幕后真正推动市场的股票，因为我们看到的是一个充满乐观情绪、屏幕一片绿意的交易日。您关注的是什么，克里斯蒂娜？

I feel like we have to be talking about AMD today and most of this week really because it is one of the biggest gainers. Shares, ticker AMD shares are up more than 10% or rather earlier was up more than 10% right now, up just about 9%. Still a pretty hefty gain.

我觉得我们今天和本周大部分时间都必须谈论 AMD，因为它无疑是最大的涨幅股之一。AMD 股票一度上涨超过 10%，现在大约上涨 9%。这仍然是一个相当可观的涨幅。

That is up more than 40% actually on a 3-day winning streak. And they really are still riding the high of news earlier this week of their chip sale agreement with Open AI, which the company says would unlock tens of billions of dollars in new revenue.

实际上，它已经连续三天上涨，涨幅超过 40%。它们仍在受益于本周早些时候关于与 OpenAI 芯片销售协议的消息，该公司表示该协议将带来数十亿美元的新收入。

Now, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst weighing in saying that it will help OpenAI diversify its chip supply, of course. And Barclay's analyst also saying that rather than this being sort of a diversification play away from Nvidia, this just really shows that the ecosystem is just desperate for more, more computing power, more investment, and it's not a crowding out. It's actually an expansion of that ecosystem to just bring in more players.

现在，彭博社情报分析师也发表看法，表示这将有助于 OpenAI 实现芯片供应的多元化。巴克莱的分析师也表示，这与其说是为了实现与英伟达的多元化，不如说这恰恰表明了整个生态系统对更多的计算能力和投资的需求非常迫切，这并非是在排挤，而是在拓展生态系统，吸引更多参与者。

It's not a crowding out, it's just an expansion. I like the way they put that. Although, I do wonder why we can't get more specifics than tens of billions of dollars in new generation of revenue. new new revenue generated. I feel like that, you know, that lack of specificity worries me a bit.

“这不是排挤，而是一种扩张。” 我很喜欢他们这样表述。不过，我确实想知道为什么我们得不到比“数十亿美元的新一代收入”更具体的数字。我总觉得，这种缺乏具体性的说法让我有些担忧。

Yeah. I I mean, I guess they're going to argue that, oh, this is their long-term framework, right? So, you got to think like further out into the horizon. At least that's going to be the the probably the uh uh the the the selling point. But anyway, we'll see. Um but yeah, I mean, I think investors are just really happy to ride this wave. you know, no one seems to be willing to um willing to get off the train uh even if there are signs of caution abounding.

是的。我想他们会辩称，这是他们的长期框架，对吧？所以，你得看得更长远一些。至少这会是他们的一个卖点。但不管怎样，我们拭目以待。我认为投资者们非常乐意乘着这股浪潮。你知道，即使有种种迹象表明需要谨慎，似乎也没有人愿意下车。

But yeah, it just keeps going. It's the gift that keeps on giving apparently. Right. It certainly is. And and you're looking at Dell, which is a legacy tech name, an old school tech name that's gotten a big pop because of the AI play.

但它还在继续。这似乎是一份“源源不断”的礼物。没错。确实如此。再来看看戴尔，这是一个传统的科技巨头，一个老牌科技公司，也因为 AI 概念而获得了巨大的提振。

### 戴尔受益于 AI 需求增长，但盈利能力受关注

Absolutely, Scarlet. And yeah, so Dell benefiting from that as well, even though as you say, is a little bit more of an old school tech company. So shares at the moment ticker DL those are rising as well more up more than 7% earlier it hit the highest level since May 2024. So we also got a long-term update from Dell. They were talking about their growth estimates for sales and profit over the next two years and that basically doubled. um they they had revealed that in an investor event uh this week and again the reason being cited by the company is demand for AI products.

绝对的，斯嘉丽。是的，戴尔也从中受益，尽管正如你所说，它是一家更偏向传统的老牌科技公司。目前，戴尔（股票代码：DL）的股价也在上涨，涨幅超过 7%，此前曾达到 2024 年 5 月以来的最高点。本周，我们还从戴尔那里获得了一份长期更新。他们谈到了未来两年销售和利润的增长预测，结果几乎翻倍。这是该公司在本周的投资者活动中披露的，再次被公司引用的原因是 AI 产品的需求。

So the word on the street though very interesting right so Bloomer intelligence analysts saying that obviously there are strong AI server sales definitely helping uh strengthen that outlook and it also shows that there is durable demand and enough room for market share gains. The big question that Bloomberg and analysts are really honing in on is how does this square with their profit margins, right?

街头巷议，非常有趣，不是吗？彭博社情报分析师表示，强劲的 AI 服务器销售无疑有助于巩固这一前景，同时也表明存在持久的需求和足够的市场份额增长空间。彭博社和分析师们真正关注的重大问题是，这与他们的利润率如何匹配，对吧？

Because this equipment, it costs a lot of money to make. It costs a lot of money to roll out and is this something that would crimp those margins eventually. Um Dell sounded optimistic at their investor event, but that is still the big question for investors.

因为这些设备，制造它们的成本很高。部署它们的成本也很高，这是否会最终压缩他们的利润率？在投资者活动中，戴尔听起来很乐观，但这仍然是投资者们面临的重大问题。

I think that's such an important point, especially after what we've learned about Oracle, right? There was that report that its profit margin in its cloud computing business and I recognize that we're talking about different parts of the whole AI machine, but um Oracle's profit margin in the cloud computing business is actually lower than what many on Wall Street had been anticipating. So as much as people are getting ahead and excited about what this means for new business, um it's going to come at a cost at least initially.

我认为这是一个非常重要的观点，尤其是在我们了解了关于甲骨文的情况之后。有一份报告指出，其云计算业务的利润率，我知道我们讨论的是整个 AI 体系的不同部分，但甲骨文云计算业务的利润率实际上低于华尔街许多人的预期。因此，尽管人们对新业务感到兴奋，但这至少在初期会付出一定的成本。

Yeah, it's all going to be about the margins Scarlet and definitely something to watch for the earning season. last name that you're watching watching Fair Isaac as well, which we probably all know as FICO. So, ticker FICO, those shares down more than 8% at the moment because it's it's not actually FICO specific news. It's news from its competitor Equifax saying that its Vantage score 4.0 service will offer mortgage credit scores at $4.50 through the end of 2027.

是的，斯嘉丽，这一切都将围绕利润率展开，这绝对是财报季值得关注的。最后一个您提到的值得关注的名字是 Fair Isaac，我们可能都知道它叫 FICO。FICO 股票代码为 FICO，目前下跌超过 8%。这不是 FICO 特有的消息，而是其竞争对手 Equifax 的消息，Equifax 表示其 Vantage score 4.0 服务将在 2027 年底前以 4.50 美元的价格提供抵押贷款信用评分。

### Fair Isaac 股价下跌，受 Equifax 低价服务冲击

So, this is a response to what we saw from FICO last week, which is that they will now sell credit scores directly to mortgage resellers, which sent the shares of their competitors plunging. So, now this is a report from Equifax actually saying that they're responding to FICO's quote monopoly like doubling of their mortgage credit score prices to $10 next year.

这是对我们上周从 FICO 那里看到的情况的回应，FICO 表示将直接向抵押贷款经销商出售信用评分，这导致其竞争对手的股价暴跌。现在，Equifax 发布的一份报告实际上是在回应 FICO 将明年其抵押贷款信用评分价格翻倍至 10 美元，FICO 被指控利用其“垄断地位”。

It's really been quite the back and forth that we've been seeing between FICO and then its private competitor, Vantage Score. They're really duking it out right now, trying to see who has the most attractive opportunity right now.

我们看到 FICO 和其私营竞争对手 Vantage Score 之间确实上演了一场激烈的拉锯战。它们现在正在激烈竞争，试图看谁能抓住目前最有吸引力的机遇。
