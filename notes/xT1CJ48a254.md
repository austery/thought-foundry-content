### 投资的本质：一场“输家游戏”

我们之所以进行投资，根本目的是为了让财富在未来几十年内实现增长，以支撑退休后的生活开销。对于大多数人而言，仅凭社会保障金难以维持生计，因此需要让资金“工作起来”，实现比通货膨胀更快的复利增长。作为投资者，核心职责是确保不干扰投资组合的长期复利能力。然而，现实情况是，我们大多数人都在参与一场“输家游戏”（Loser's Game）。

“输家游戏”这一概念由查理·埃利斯（Charlie Ellis）在数十年前提出，并最终发展成一本名为《赢得输家游戏》的书。埃利斯，一位传奇人物，曾任耶鲁大学捐赠基金主席及先锋集团（The Vanguard Group）董事会成员，他敏锐地观察到投资与网球有着惊人的相似之处：两者都包含“赢家游戏”和“输家游戏”两种模式。

以网球为例，职业选手（顶尖的0.01%）玩的是“赢家游戏”，他们通过得分、发强力ACE球、精准有力的击球、压线球、巧妙的放短等技巧来赢得比赛。而我们绝大多数业余爱好者（99.9%）则在玩“输家游戏”。我们输掉比赛，往往是因为“非受迫性失误”（unforced errors）。这些失误包括：发球过猛导致双误，击球出界、下网，或者直接将球打到对手的有利位置。业余选手的问题在于试图超出自身能力范围去“杀死”比赛，而不是简单地将球打回场内，保持比赛进行。正如埃利斯所言，如果你能减少非受迫性失误，并让对手犯错，你就能在“输家游戏”中获胜。

埃利斯将这一洞察应用于投资领域，发现情况如出一辙。极少数顶尖专业人士能够精准选股、择时卖出、识别投资板块或国家，并成功预测市场走向。这些人是家喻户晓的投资巨星，如沃伦·巴菲特（Warren Buffett）或彼得·林奇（Peter Lynch），他们之所以如此出名，正是因为他们是极端的“异常值”（outliers）。而我们其余人，则是在玩“输家游戏”，并且往往玩得很糟糕。我们之所以表现不佳，是因为我们犯了太多错误：情绪化交易、过度交易、忽视交易成本、逃避税收。如果能避免这些错误，我们的投资表现将大为改观。

The reason we even invest is because we want to put our money to work so that 20, 30, 40 years from now, we're going to stop working and retire, and we're going to need something to pay our bills. Most of us aren't going to be able to live on just Social Security, and so we put our money to work so that it'll compound faster than the rate of inflation. And really it's your job as an investor to not interfere with your portfolio's ability to compound over that time.

The loser's game is a concept created by Charlie Ellis in a paper he wrote 30, 40 years ago. Eventually it became a book called "Winning the Loser's Game." And Ellis, legendary guy, chairman of the Yale endowment, on the board of directors of The Vanguard Group, Ellis noticed that investing and tennis were both very similar in that they're two games in one. There's a winner's game and a loser's game.

What does that mean? Well, let's use tennis as Ellis's example. There are two games in tennis: the game the professionals play, the top 0.01% of players, and then there's the game the rest of us play, us 99.9% of the world who are amateurs. How do the professionals play? They play the winning game. They win by scoring points. They serve aces. They hit with power and accuracy. They kiss the line. They do fancy drop shots, lots of top spin. They keep the ball away from their opponent.

That's not how the loser's game is played. That's not how the amateur plays. How do us amateurs play? We lose through unforced errors. What sort of unforced errors? We double fault because we're trying to serve too hard. We hit the ball long, we hit it wide, we hit it into the net, we hit it right to our opponent. Instead of trying to play outside ourselves beyond our own ability, us amateur tennis players just return the ball, just keep it in play. Don't try and kill it. Don't try and hit the line. You are not skillful enough to do that. If you make fewer unforced errors and you let your opponent make those mistakes, you will win the loser's game by making less errors.

And so Ellis compared tennis to investing and he found something really fascinating. A handful of professionals, a tiny number of people, they can pick stocks and know when to sell them. They can identify which sector or country to invest in. They can time the markets. That's the 0.01% of people, and they're household names. You know who Warren Buffett or Peter Lynch is because they're such outliers. The rest of us, we're playing the loser's game. We're unfortunately underperforming because we're making all of these errors. We get emotional. We overtrade. We don't pay attention to costs. We ignore taxes. We make all of these mistakes that if only we avoided them, we would do so much better. That's why Ellis thought investing and tennis were so similar. Most of us are playing the loser's game and playing it badly. If we make fewer unforced errors, we would just be so much better off.

### 选股的低概率与专业困境

学术研究揭示了一个令人惊讶的事实：绝大多数市场回报是由极少数股票驱动的。一项由亚利桑那州立大学的亨德里克·贝森宾德（Hendrik Bessembinder）教授进行的研究发现，在过去75年中，仅有约2%的股票贡献了全部的市场回报。这意味着，许多股票的表现平平甚至下跌，而少数巨头则引领了整体市场的上涨。

在“输家游戏”的框架下，每一次投资决策都可能成为犯错的机会。考虑到仅有2%的股票是真正的增长引擎，我们普通投资者选中那只“万中无一”的潜力股的概率微乎其微。要成为成功的股票选股者，需要具备三个极其困难的条件：首先，准确识别未来1到10年内能够持续增长营收和利润的公司；其次，以合理的价格在恰当的时机买入，避免“高位接盘”；第三，能够承受公司发展过程中出现的各种波动——经济周期、营收或利润预期的失误、股价的起伏——并坚持持有。

区分一家公司是暂时回调还是其增长前景已永久黯淡，是一项极具挑战的任务。情感上的“沉没成本效应”（endowment effect）会让我们难以割舍已持有的股票，即使其基本面已发生变化，我们仍倾向于认为“我拥有它，所以它一定不错”。例如，25年前一同被纳入道琼斯工业平均指数的**微软**（Microsoft）和**英特尔**（Intel），前者表现卓越，后者则相对逊色。在股票被纳入知名指数时，往往意味着其已是顶尖公司，但即便如此，它们未来的表现也可能天差地别，这在事前是极难预判的。

这种选股的难度不仅体现在个人投资者身上，专业基金经理也面临同样的困境。数据显示，在任何一年，不到一半的基金经理能够跑赢其基准指数。将时间拉长至五年，高达80%的基金经理无法超越基准；十年内，这一比例超过90%；净扣除费用和税收后，超过十年的成功者更是凤毛麟角。这意味着，绝大多数专业人士，即使付出了巨大的努力，也无法持续稳定地跑赢简单的市场指数。

So a number of academic studies have found that a surprisingly few percentage of stocks are actually driving market returns. Professor Hendrik Bessembinder at Arizona State University did a study, and he found that just 2% of stocks are responsible for all the returns that we've seen over the past 75 years. Depending on the country you look at, maybe it's a little more, a little less, but it averages around 2%. How is that possible? Well, some stocks are up a little each year. Some stocks are down a little each year. Some stocks are flat. They all kind of cancel out. A handful of stocks are down a lot. Some stocks get crushed and go to zero. That leaves very few stocks that are the giant winners that drive returns.

In the context of the loser's game where we want to make fewer mistakes, every decision we make is another opportunity for error. And given how much the odds are stacked against us, if only 2% of stocks are driving most of the returns, what are the odds that we're going to pick that 1 in 50 stocks that's going to be a big winner? First, you have to identify a company that over the next 1, 3, 5, 10 years is going to grow its revenue and its profits. That's hard to do. Secondly, you have to buy that stock at the right time and at the right price. Overpaying for a stock isn't going to help you at all. Third, you have to be willing to hold that through all the ups and downs that company is going to go through. Economic cycles, missed revenue expectations, missed profits. Stocks don't go up in a straight line, they're up and down. And sometimes when stocks pull back, it's just a temporary setback and eventually they recover. Knowing when something is just pulling back temporarily or that its best days are behind it and it's on the way down permanently, that's a really difficult thing to do. Emotionally, we have all these sunk costs in that stock. We've researched it, we've investigated it. If it's helped make us money, we're loathed to cut it loose because hey, we're tied up. It's the endowment effect. I own it, therefore it has to be pretty good.

It's very, very difficult to tell the difference between a Microsoft and an Intel. Both added to the Dow Jones Industrial 25 years ago, Microsoft has done exceedingly well. Intel not so much. How can you identify that in advance? Being added to the Dow is like, hey, you've made it. This is the top group of stocks as decided by the editors of Dow Jones. And now when we look at the performance of these two stocks, they've gone in completely different degrees. The odds are stacked against you being a successful stock picker.

And to put some numbers to that, let's take a look at professional mutual fund managers. In any given year, less than half of them beat their benchmark, meaning they're going to do better than the market. So that's telling us fewer than 50% are actually picking stocks better than just a boring, cheap index is performing. You take that one year and expand that out to five years, it turns out 80% of them fail to beat their benchmark. You take that to 10 years and it's over 90%. Net of fees and taxes, less than 1 in 10 mutual fund managers beat their benchmark. And over 20 years, it's virtually nobody.

### 指数化投资与自动化策略的优势

理解了作为个股选股者面临的巨大挑战后，**指数化投资**（Index Investing）的流行便不足为奇了。其核心理念是“与其大海捞针，不如买下整个草垛”，即通过购买包含市场大部分股票的指数基金或ETF，来确保自己拥有市场中表现最佳的资产。这种策略能够有效规避个人行为失误对投资组合的干扰，例如过早卖出股票或试图择时交易。

实践指数化投资的关键步骤之一是**自动化投资流程**。通过定期定额投资（Dollar Cost Averaging），例如每月或每发薪日自动从401k、403b等税收递延账户中扣款购买股票或指数基金，可以有效地将情绪从投资决策中剥离。无论市场上涨还是下跌，都能按计划执行。市场上涨时，之前购买的资产价值提升；市场下跌时，则能以更低的价格买入更多份额。长期来看，这种“无论如何都买入”的策略，根据数学模型，是实现未来投资最有效的方式。正如诺贝尔经济学奖得主保罗·萨缪尔森（Paul Samuelson）所言：“投资应该是枯燥的，就像看油漆变干或草生长。如果你想找乐子，就带800美元去拉斯维加斯赌博。”切勿将投资组合当作赌博。

**多元化配置**（Diversification）是另一项基石。投资是一个令人谦卑的过程，因为我们无法准确预测哪只股票、哪种商品、哪个行业、哪个国家或哪类资产在今年会表现最佳。每年的市场表现图（patchwork）都显示出，表现最好的板块年复一年地变化——有时是房地产投资信托（REITs），有时是科技股，有时又是小盘价值股。试图预测这些变化几乎是不可能的。因此，与其“乱猜”，不如构建一个广泛多元化的投资组合，持有“一点点所有东西”。这意味着你总能参与到上涨的板块中，即使在某个领域投资比例不高，也能在其他领域获得收益。多元化确保了你广泛参与各类资产，而非孤注一掷地投机，这是拥有最佳表现资产的可靠途径。

And so understanding how much the odds are stacked against you as a stock picker is why indexing has become so popular these days. People have figured out, I'm not going to try and pick the next Nvidia, I'm going to buy all the stocks and that way I'm guaranteed to own that. And it prevents you from allowing your behavioral errors to interfere with your portfolio. You are not selling a stock prematurely. You're not timing the market. If you do regular dollar cost average, if you buy a chunk of stock, you buy a specific index every month, every paycheck, you're guaranteed over the long haul to do better than 99% of your fellow investors.

So when you're thinking about putting money in the market, you need to have a plan. And I try and lay out a number of specific steps you can take really to prevent yourself from interfering with your money's ability to compound in the market. So first step is to automate the process. Take the emotions out of it. With your 401k or 403b or whatever your tax-deferred saving plan is, you are making contributions every paycheck. If the market goes up, great, it means what you bought before is higher. If the market goes down, great, you're buying more at a better price. Over the fullness of time, that sort of dollar cost averaging, every paycheck, every month, means that you are buying regardless. And the math tells us that's the most effective way to invest for the future. Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson once said, "Investing should be boring. It should be like watching paint dry or grass grow. If you want to have some fun, take $800 and go to Vegas and gamble." Don't gamble with your portfolio.

Let's talk about diversification. Investing is really a very humbling exercise. We all have to admit to ourselves, we don't know what stock, what commodity, what sector, what country, what asset class is going to do best this year. You know, you get this quilts, this patchwork showing year by year what have been the best performing sectors in the market, and it's completely different year by year. One year REITs are at the top of the league table. The next year it's tech stocks. The next year it's small cap value. It's all but impossible to predict. And so rather than throw darts, rather than guess, we own a broad diversified portfolio. We own a little bit of everything. And that means you're always participating in the sector that's going up. You probably wish you had more of it this year, and then next year when it's not doing well, you're happy that you didn't overload that particular sector. Diversification means you're broadly participating in every asset class rather than speculating, rather than guessing. It's the best way to make sure you own the best-performing assets. You know, Jack Bogle, founder of Vanguard Group, famously said, "Instead of hunting for a needle in a haystack, just buy the whole haystack."

### 成本控制与情绪纪律的重要性

在投资过程中，**成本**（Costs）是不可忽视的关键因素。无论是基金管理费、交易佣金还是税收，它们都会直接侵蚀投资回报。研究表明，在25至30年的投资周期内，高成本投资组合的最终价值可能比低成本投资组合低20%。以**先锋集团**（Vanguard Group）创始人**杰克·博格尔**（Jack Bogle）倡导的低成本基金为例，其“先锋效应”（Vanguard effect）通过压低行业费用，仅在2016年前的30年里就为投资者节省了约1万亿美元。这笔巨款得以留在投资者的手中，并继续复利增长。

回顾过去，20世纪60年代和70年代，共同基金的管理费高达1%-2%，甚至还有高达5%的前端费用，这意味着你交给基金公司的100美元，只有95美元会被用于投资。而如今，购买广泛的市场指数基金（如S&P 500或Vanguard Total Market）的费用已降至极低的水平，例如仅为5个基点（0.05%）。成本的降低直接转化为更高的净回报，并随着时间推移而累积。

除了显性成本，**情绪化监控**也是一个潜在的陷阱。技术进步使我们能够实时追踪投资组合的每一秒变动，但这往往是过度反应的诱因。过于频繁地查看投资组合，尤其是在市场波动时，可能会导致恐慌性卖出或过度交易。理想的做法是偶尔检查，例如每月一次，以了解整体情况。如果发现自己不自觉地频繁查看，这可能是一个信号：要么是风险敞口过大，要么是市场正进入波动期，而这恰恰是低价买入的潜在机会。

You have to be aware of costs. That's just simple math. The more you're paying for a mutual fund or an ETF, the more that drags on your performance. In fact, we've seen a number of studies over the years that over the course of 25, 30 years, a high-cost portfolio, everything else being equal, will generate 20% less value at the end of those 25, 30 years than a low-cost portfolio. A study on the Bogle effect, Jack Bogle was the founder of Vanguard that specializes in very low-cost funds, you could look at BlackRock and State Street are similarly low-cost funds are known for that. The Vanguard effect has identified that by 2016, Vanguard fee pressure had essentially saved investors $1 trillion over the previous 30 years since Vanguard launched in the mid-1970s. Since 2016, over the next decade, it's about another trillion dollars in fees that have been saved by the Vanguard effect. It's that much more money in portfolios. It's that much more money that's compound and that investors own. And so fees matter a great deal.

Go back to the bad old days of the 1960s and '70s. Mutual funds used to cost 1, 1.5, 2% of your assets. Some funds came with a front end load of 5%. In other words, you give the fund company a hundred bucks and they invest 95 of it for you. Think about what a drag that is on returns. And really the technology didn't exist for us to understand this easily. People just saw the markets were going up from World War II to, let's call it 1966, was a really substantial gain in assets. Nobody really focused on what's driving these gains and what are the headwinds we're up against. And then something similar took place in the 1980s and '90s. We had a big bull market. Around the '70s and '80s was when we first started paying attention to the data as to the drag fees put on performance. So it's not just mutual funds, it's transaction costs. You know, it used to cost $300, $400, $500 to buy a stock. It's free today. We deregulated the markets in the early '70s, and that allowed brokers to compete on fees. And we went from a few hundred bucks to a hundred bucks. I remember the commercials for the various online trading shops, $8 transactions. Eventually that became free trading. And so the cost structure of that is gone. And then when we look at what's taken place with mutual funds and ETFs, it used to be 1, 1.5, 2% to buy those. They're well under half a percent today. You could buy a broad index like the S&P 500 or the Vanguard Total Market. It's five bips. The cost is practically nothing, and that just compounds in your favor. The lower your costs, the more you keep at the end of your investing life.

You know, back in the bad old days, you would get a quarterly update of your portfolio, you'd get a statement and it was a big deal. Everybody sat around waiting for their statements to arrive and you would see how well you did. And that was probably too extreme in one direction. Technology has given us the ability to watch our portfolios second by second, tick by tick. That's too far in the other direction. You should check your portfolio occasionally just to see how it's doing. Monthly is probably plenty. If you are concerned about something in particular and you start noticing yourself checking your portfolio more frequently, sometimes that's a little bit of an alert that, hey, maybe you have too much risk on and you're too concerned about your exposure, or maybe you are entering a period of market volatility and that's going to create an opportunity for you to buy stocks at a cheaper price.

### 预测的无效性与避免市场时机

关于**再平衡**（Rebalancing），其核心思想是在股票上涨导致其在投资组合中占比过高时，卖出部分股票，买入相对滞后的债券，反之亦然。理想情况下，这相当于“高卖低买”。然而，对于大多数投资者而言，再平衡并非最优先事项。真正的机会在于市场大幅回调（如下跌20%-40%）时，主动地将资产配置向股票倾斜。

“**没人知道**”（Nobody knows anything）这句名言出自编剧威廉·高德曼（William Goldman），他曾尖锐地批评好莱坞在预测电影票房上的无能。几乎所有大制片厂都错过了《星球大战》、《夺宝奇兵》和《E.T.》等影片。同样的概念适用于投资预测。市场预测（Forecasts）是专业人士对特定资产在特定时间达到特定价格的断言。然而，历史研究，如沃顿商学院菲利普·泰特洛克（Philip Tetlock）教授的研究，表明专家预测的准确性并不比普通人高多少。

过去几年的事件充分证明了预测的局限性：2020年初无人预料到全球大流行及其对经济的影响，更无人预测到随后的股市飙升；2021年俄乌冲突的爆发；2022年美联储大幅加息导致股债双杀。这些都是极其罕见的事件。未来充满随机性和不可预见性，一年期的市场预测几乎是徒劳的。如果我们的投资决策基于这些不可靠的预测，结果很可能是糟糕的。

我们必须警惕**市场时机**（Market Timing）的诱惑，尤其是在市场下跌时变得恐惧和情绪化。历史数据显示，市场每年平均下跌5%两次，每三年下跌10%两次，并且定期出现20%以上的跌幅。如果对市场的每一次微小波动都做出反应，我们将严重阻碍投资组合的长期复利增长。

市场在很大程度上是有效的。当你在新闻网站、电视或报纸上看到某个信息时，几乎可以肯定，其他有资本的投资者也已经看到了并采取了行动。这意味着该信息早已反映在股票价格中。你看到的“新闻”，对市场而言已经是“旧闻”。研究表明，那些在市场低点恐慌性抛售的投资者中，约有30%的人再也没有回到股票市场。想想2009年初那些恐慌性卖出的人，他们错过了之后15年股市的辉煌。这种行为对投资组合的长期表现是毁灭性的。

因此，避免这些“非受迫性失误”，制定并坚持一个计划，才是赢得“输家游戏”的真正秘诀。

People talk about the importance of rebalancing. Let me give you a little context of what rebalancing means and how you should think about it. The idea is that stocks go up over the long run. And so if you have a portfolio that let's say is 70% equities and 30% bonds, in the event of a market selloff, hey, maybe you end up 60% equities and 40% bonds because of how those two asset classes have moved. What we suggest to people is that they rebalance into equities. You sell a little bit of the bonds that ran up, you buy a little bit of the equities that ran down. And essentially what you're doing is selling bonds high and buying stocks low. It's sort of counterintuitive. The time to rebalance into equities are when we have these deep market corrections or drawdowns, down 20, 30, 40%, that's where you want to engage that. Most of the time, you shouldn't really be worrying too much about rebalancing. I don't think it's that important for the average investor's portfolio.

So, "Nobody knows anything" comes from William Goldman, who was a screenwriter in the '60s '70s, '80s. And he wrote a pretty scathing confessional about Hollywood and how bad executives in the various studios were at predicting which films would do well. Almost all the studios passed on "Star Wars," on "Raiders of the Lost Ark," on "E.T." And it's only when one random person says, "All right, let's give this a shot," that some of these movies go on to become blockbusters, despite most of Hollywood not thinking there was anything there.

Taking that same concept to the world of forecasts. Forecasts are when a market professional or expert or talking head or pundit says, "I believe this asset class will be this price at this time." Specific asset, specific time and date, specific price. And when we look back through the history of expert forecasts, it turns out that the experts are no better than any of us. Wharton Professor Philip Tetlock did a study on this. He looked at thousands and thousands of forecasts. He found they were no better than the average person's prediction, and the average person's prediction is pretty bad. Just take a look at the past few years. Heading into 2020, nobody had a pandemic closing the economy. Oh, and by the way, from March till the end of the year, the market's going to rip up 69%. That wasn't in anybody's forecast. Nobody had the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2021. 2022, nobody had the Federal Reserve raising interest rates 500 basis points, sending stocks and bonds down double digits. That's a very rare occurrence for stocks and bonds to both be down that much in the same year, hadn't happened for 40 years. And so it turns out, the future is just so filled with random events and unanticipated things occurring that making forecasts out a year, it's really a fool's errand. And if we make our investments based on these forecasts, we're really destined to do poorly.

We have to be aware of our market timing, and becoming fearful and emotional every time the market has a pullback. We look at the history of markets, they're down 5% twice a year, they're down 10% two out of every three years, and they're down 20% fairly regularly. If you respond to every time the market twitches, you're going to prevent your portfolio from compounding over time. We think we can time markets. Here's the fascinating thing about news and market timing. Markets are pretty efficient. You know, they're not 100% perfectly efficient, but if you're seeing something on a website, on TV, in a newspaper, the odds are that every other person with capital at risk in the markets has not only seen it, but acted on that. And that news is already reflected in stock prices. So you see the cover of a magazine or the headline in The Wall Street Journal, that information is already in the price. To imagine that you're going to read that and then act on it in a way that's going to be beneficial to you, you're essentially trading on old information. I know we call it news, it's news to you, but it's old to the market.

What studies have shown us about people who sell when markets make a low, in other words, they panic sell into a crash. About 30% of these people never return to equities ever again. That's an amazing statistic. Think about what happened when people panic sold January, February, March 2009. The market has had an incredible run over the next 15 years, and nearly a third of people who sold into those lows never got back into equities. That's devastating to a portfolio's performance. Avoiding these unforced errors, having a plan and sticking to it, that's the secret of winning the loser's game.
