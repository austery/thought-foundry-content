### 司法透明度与政治审查：爱泼斯坦文件疑云及联邦机构人事变动

《纽约时报》近期对爱泼斯坦案件文件进行的一项新审查显示，司法部（DOJ）在公开的文件中遗漏了与一名女性相关的关键材料。该女性指控爱泼斯坦及总统特朗普在她未成年时对其实施了性侵犯。文件索引揭示，联邦调查局（FBI）曾就其指控进行了四次访谈，并撰写了访谈摘要，但仅公布了描述其对爱泼斯坦指控的一个摘要。其余超过50页的材料则下落不明。

公开的文件中确实包含一份关于她对特朗普指控的陈述，其中联邦官员写道，该女性声称在20世纪80年代中期，她大约14岁时，特朗普对她进行了“暴力且耸人听闻”的侵犯。然而，这些文件并未包含对该指控可信度的任何评估。司法部此前曾表示，文件中关于特朗普的指控是“毫无根据且虚假的”。白宫发言人本周回应《纽约时报》关于为何未公开相关文件的问题时称，总统在与爱泼斯坦有关的任何事情上都已“完全洗清嫌疑”。

在过去几天里，司法部给出了各种不同的回应。起初，它声称仅扣留了重复或特权信息。现在，它表示正在审查文件，并将公开任何本应公开的材料。根据去年国会通过的一项法律，司法部只能在有限的情况下（例如，可能用于识别受害者或危及正在进行的调查）才能从爱泼斯坦文件中删减材料。该法律明确禁止联邦官员以“尴尬、声誉损害或政治敏感性”为由扣留材料。众议院监督委员会的首席民主党代表、加利福尼亚州议员**罗伯特·加西亚**（Robert Garcia）表示，司法部未能就为何遗漏与特朗普相关的材料提供合理解释。民主党人计划就此事展开调查。

此外，《纽约时报》还获悉，联邦调查局局长**卡什·帕特尔**（Cash Patel）已解雇了约10名曾参与调查总统特朗普处理机密文件一案的雇员。2022年，联邦调查局搜查了特朗普的海湖庄园，调查其在第一任期结束后是否因保留敏感国家安全记录而违反法律，以及他是否阻碍了政府多次追回这些文件的努力。路透社本周披露，帕特尔本人的电话记录也在此次调查中被传唤。他当时是特朗普的亲密顾问。如今，作为联邦调查局的负责人，帕特尔对那些调查过特朗普的人进行了一系列报复。在某些情况下，被解雇的特工及其律师表示，帕特尔违反了本应保护联邦调查局雇员免受政治动机解雇的保障措施。

在另一则国内动态中，参议院健康委员会昨日就特朗普总统提名的美国外科总监候选人**凯西·梅斯**（Casey Means）举行了确认听证会。梅斯是一位作家和健康影响者，曾是健康部长**罗伯特·F·肯尼迪**（Robert F. Kennedy Jr.）“让美国再次健康”（Make America Healthy Again）运动的关键人物。在听证会上，梅斯在农药、避孕和疫苗等“热点”问题上，很大程度上回避了具体问题。相反，她侧重于她认为美国人正遭受与过度加工食品、化学物质、压力和缺乏运动相关的慢性疾病流行。她拒绝了传统医疗体系，这被认为是**罗伯特·F·肯尼迪**希望她担任此职的原因之一。健康记者**丹尼·布鲁姆**（Danny Bloom）指出，梅斯是一位高度非传统的选择，因为尽管她毕业于医学院，但她没有有效的行医执照。她的许多支持者认为，这正是我们需要的领导者，一个了解如何“拆解”医疗系统的人。然而，许多批评者认为，这种不信任和对医疗系统的谴责恰恰是她不应担任此职的原因。由共和党控制的卫生委员会预计将批准梅斯的提名，并将其提交参议院进行最终确认投票。

From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Thursday, February 26th. Here's what we're covering.

A new review by the Times of documents from the Epstein files shows that the Justice Department left out key materials related to a woman who said Epstein and President Trump sexually assaulted her when she was a minor. An index in the files revealed that the FBI had conducted four interviews in connection with her claims and wrote summaries about each one, but only one of those summaries, which describes her accusations against Epstein, was released. The other memos, more than 50 pages of material, are missing. The public files do contain one description of her account about Trump in which federal officials wrote that she claimed Trump assaulted her in a violent and lurid encounter in the mid1 1980s when she was roughly 14 years old. The files don't include any assessment about the credibility of her accusation. The DOJ had previously said there were unfounded and false claims about Trump in the files and a White House spokeswoman said this week that the president has been quote totally exonerated on anything relating to Epstein in response to questions from the Times about why the files related to the woman were not released. The Justice Department has given various responses over the past few days. It first said that the only materials it withheld were either duplicates or privileged information. It now says it's reviewing the files and that it will publish any documents it should have made public. Under a law passed by Congress last year, the DOJ can only redact material from the Epstein files in limited scenarios, like if it could be used to identify victims or would jeopardize an ongoing investigation. The law specifically forbids federal officials from withholding materials to protect public figures, quote, on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity. The top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, Representative Robert Garcia of California, said the Justice Department had not provided a proper explanation for why the materials related to Trump are missing. Democrats plan to open an investigation into the matter.

Also, the Times has learned that Cash Patel, the director of the FBI, has fired about 10 employees who worked on the investigation into President Trump's handling of classified documents. Back in 2022, the FBI searched Mara Lago as part of an inquiry into whether Trump broke the law by keeping sensitive national security records after his first term ended and whether he obstructed the government's repeated efforts to get them back. Reuters revealed this week that Patel's own phone records were subpoenenaed as part of that investigation. He was a close Trump adviser at the time. Now, in his position as head of the FBI, Patel has carried out a rolling barrage of retribution against people who investigated Trump. In some cases, agents who've been fired and their lawyers say that Patel has violated safeguards that were supposed to protect FBI employees from politically motivated dismissals.

Now, two other quick updates on the Trump administration. Do you believe that there's no evidence that the flu vaccine has efficacy in reducing serious injury or hospitalization? I >> I I >> This is an easy one, doctor. >> This is an easy one. >> On Capitol Hill yesterday, the Senate Health Committee held a confirmation hearing for Casey Means, President Trump's nominee for US Surgeon General. Means, an author and wellness influencer, has been a key figure in health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Make America Healthy Again movement. Over the course of the hearing, Means largely deflected specific questions about hot button maha issues like pesticides, birth control, and vaccines. Instead, she focused on how, in her view, Americans are suffering from an epidemic of chronic diseases linked to ultrarocessed foods, chemicals, stress, and lack of exercise. I think what's really striking is that part of why RFK said that he wanted her to be surgeon general is because she's rejected the traditional medical system. Danny Bloom is a health reporter at the times. She says that means is a highly unconventional pick for the role as the nation's doctor as the surgeon general is called. That's in large part because while she graduated from medical school, she doesn't have an active medical license. A lot of her supporters say that that is precisely the kind of person we need in charge, someone who has been inside the medical system. And so in theory knows a bit about how to dismantle it. But a lot of critics also think that that level of distrust and that sort of condemnation of the medical system is exactly why she shouldn't have this role. The Republican controlled health committee is expected to greenlight Means's nomination, sending it to the full Senate for a final confirmation vote.

### 地缘政治博弈与经济格局演变

今天，美国与伊朗将就一项高风险的核谈判展开会谈，其结果可能决定特朗普总统是否会攻击该国。特朗普要求伊朗彻底放弃其核野心，并已向该地区调动了大规模军事力量以支持这一立场。伊朗已表示拒绝，但现在正带着一项妥协方案来到谈判桌前。

伊朗官员告诉《纽约时报》，该国计划提出一项提议，允许特朗普宣称胜利，同时仍允许伊朗维持一定程度的核浓缩。伊朗领导人坚称，他们无意研发核武器，但希望能够将核材料用于医疗目的，例如癌症治疗研究。伊朗还试图通过承诺购买美国飞机等商品，并邀请美国公司投资伊朗的石油和天然气行业来“软化”交易。他们的希望是，美国也能解除已将伊朗经济推向近乎崩溃的经济制裁。一位美国中东关系专家告诉《纽约时报》，今天将是双方“摊牌”的日子。他引用道：“如果伊朗未能表现出足够的妥协意愿，而美国又未能表现出提供足够制裁减免的意愿，情况将‘爆炸式’发展。”

现在，关于特朗普政府的另外两则简要更新。

接着，美国与古巴的关系持续紧张。美国国务卿**马可·卢比奥**（Marco Rubio）表示，美国正试图收集更多关于古巴所称的发生在岛屿海岸附近的一场致命枪战的信息。根据古巴国家媒体的报道，一艘注册在佛罗里达州的快艇昨天接近古巴，船上人员向古巴边防卫队开火，卫队随即还击。快艇上有四人死亡，六人受伤。古巴当局称，船上人员是居住在美国的武装古巴国民，他们携带了防弹衣和燃烧弹。古巴政府声称他们企图进行“带有恐怖主义目的的渗透”。当被问及这是否是美国政府的行动或是否有美国人员参与时，卢比奥表示否认。来自佛罗里达州的众议院共和党人**卡洛斯·希门尼斯**（Carlos Gimenez）称之为“一场屠杀”。随着特朗普政府采取措施“挤压”这个共产主义政权，美古两国之间的紧张关系近期不断升级。美国已切断了外国石油运输，并切断了维持古巴经济运转的收入来源。目前，古巴的状况正在恶化，通货膨胀猖獗，汽油短缺，长时间停电，食品价格飞涨，所有这些都威胁着该国政府的稳定。

最后，美国房地产市场正经历显著转变。过去几年，美国的房地产市场是一个稳固的卖方市场，甚至到了荒谬的程度。买家不仅要出价，还要拼命讨好卖家，写长篇情书给房子，出价远超要价，并放弃房屋检查。一位房地产经纪人甚至看到买家给卖家提供一只小狗。但现在情况正在逆转。据估计，每有三位试图出售房屋的人，现在只有两位买家在寻找。因此，买家变得更加挑剔，房屋的销售周期拉长。卖家则感到绝望，担心新的油漆、新鲜的照片、布置好的家具能否最终带来一个出价。

至于市场转变的原因，主要是因为一些因拥有极低利率而不愿搬家的卖家，现在由于重大生活事件（如结婚、生子、离婚或死亡，即房地产经纪人所说的“四D”）而被迫将房屋挂牌出售。值得注意的是，尽管市场转变在一定程度上帮助降低了房价，但这对于许多美国人来说仍然不够。根据Zillow的数据，买家现在需要比大流行前几乎两倍的年收入才能负担得起一套普通住房。本质上，这是一个买方市场，但前提是你必须拥有购买的资源。

Today, the US and Iran will meet for a highstakes round of nuclear negotiations, and the outcome could determine whether or not President Trump attacks the country. Trump has demanded Iran give up its nuclear ambitions entirely, and he's moved a massive array of firepower to the region to back that up. Iran has refused, but it's now coming to the table with a compromise. Iranian officials tell the Times the country plans to make an offer that would allow Trump to declare victory while still letting Iran maintain some level of nuclear enrichment. The country's leaders insist it's not trying to develop a nuclear weapon, but they want to be able to use nuclear material for medical purposes, like cancer treatment studies. Iran's also trying to sweeten the deal with a pledge to buy American goods like airplanes and an invitation for American companies to invest in Iran's oil and gas industries. Their hope is that the US could also lift the economic sanctions that have pushed Iran's economy to near collapse. One expert on US Middle East relations told the Times that today will be the day for both sides to lay all their cards out on the table. And quote, "If Iran doesn't show enough willingness to compromise and the US doesn't show willingness to provide enough sanctions relief, things are going to explode."

Now, two other quick updates on the Trump administration.

Suffice it to say, it is highly unusual to see shootouts in open sea like that. It's not something that happens every day. It's something, frankly, that hasn't happened with Cuba in a very long time. Secretary of State Marco Rubio says the US is trying to gather more information about what Cuba is calling a deadly gunfight just off the coast of the island. >> The majority of the facts being publicly reported are those provided by the Cubans. We will verify that independently. >> According to Cuban state media, a speedboat registered in Florida neared Cuba yesterday and the people on board fired at Cuban border guards. The guards shot back. Four people on the speedboat were killed and six were wounded. Cuban authorities say the people on the boat were armed Cuban nationals living in the US. They had bulletproof jackets and Molotov cocktails. The Cuban government claims they were attempting quote an infiltration with terrorist ends. When asked whether it was a US government operation or whether any American personnel were involved, Rubio said no. Carlos Himenez, a House Republican from Florida, called it a massacre. Tensions between the US and Cuba have been escalating recently as the Trump administration has taken steps to squeeze the communist regime. The US has cut off foreign oil shipments and cut off sources of income that had kept Cuba's economy afloat. Conditions are now deteriorating with rampant inflation, gas shortages, lengthy blackouts, and soaring food prices. All of which is threatening to destabilize the government there.

And finally, for a couple years there, the real estate market in the US was solidly a sellers market, almost absurdly so. Buyers weren't just making offers. They were having to desperately woo the sellers. They'd write long love notes to the house. They offered way above asking price. They waved inspections. One realtor said she even saw a buyer offer the seller a puppy. But things are swinging back. According to one estimate, for every three people trying to sell a house, there's now only two people looking to buy. So buyers are getting to be pickier. Houses are sitting for longer. Sellers are the ones feeling desperate, wondering if new paint, fresh photos, staged furniture will finally get them an offer. In terms of why it shifted, basically some sellers who didn't want to move because they had such low interest rates have now finally been forced to put their homes on the market due to big life events. It's what realtors call one of the four Ds: diamonds, as in a wedding, diapers, divorce, and death. Notably, while the shift has helped bring housing prices down a little, it's not enough for many Americans. According to Zillow, buyers now need almost twice the yearly income than they did before the pandemic to afford a typical home. Essentially, it is a buyer market, but only if you have the resources to buy.
