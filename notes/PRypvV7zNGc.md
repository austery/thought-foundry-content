### 嘉宾介绍与研究背景

**主持人**: 大家好，欢迎收听本期播客，我们的特邀嘉宾是**葛艺豪**（Oscar Krberg）。他是纽约大学商学院的兼职教授，也是**《你应该了解的中国经济》**一书的作者。我强烈推荐这本书。今天非常荣幸能邀请您来到我的播客，葛艺豪。

**Host**: Hi everyone. Welcome to this podcast with my special guest **Oscar Krberg**. He's an adjunct professor teaching at NYU business school and he is also the author of **What You Should Know About Chinese Economics** and highly recommend that book and today it's a great honor to have you here in my podcast author.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的，非常高兴来到这里，非常感谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Yeah, very glad to be here. Thanks so much.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。那么，我的第一个问题是，您是如何进入中国经济这个研究领域的？是什么让您对这个话题感兴趣的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. So, first question I have is for you is I'm really interested like how did you get into this field of study like Chinese economics like what made you like be interested in this topic?

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的，我基本上是完全偶然进入这个领域的。在大学时，我学的专业与经济学毫无关系。我的专业实际上是比较宗教学，我对古代佛教等很感兴趣。我的很多课程都涉及亚洲，包括印度和中国，但都不是从现代历史、政治或经济的角度。之后我进入新闻业，做了几年报纸和技术出版物的自由撰稿人。我之所以经常在亚洲旅行，是因为我当时的妻子是一名美国外交官，她先被派往印度，后来又多次派往中国。20世纪80年代末，当我们住在印度时，我开始意识到那里的许多政治讨论都带有经济基础，但人们对此关注不多。于是我开始对经济学产生兴趣。20世纪90年代初，当我们搬到中国时，正好是**邓小平**南巡，重新启动改革开放之后，那是一个非常有趣的时期，能够亲身见证中国经济和商业环境的变革。我因此着迷。在做了几年自由职业后，我于2002年在北京成立了一家公司，以便更正式地研究中国经济。这就是我过去近四分之一个世纪一直在做的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: It basic yeah, I I basically got into it by complete accident. So at university I had nothing, I studied nothing related to economics. My major was actually comparative religion. I was interested in ancient Buddhism. And things like that. Um and um spent a lot of you know my coursework looking at Asia so India and China both but from a you know not from a modern history or uh politics or economic standpoint. Um and then I went into journalism after that and was a freelance writer for newspapers and technical publications for for a number of years. Um and um I wound up um traveling a lot in Asia because my wife at the time was a US diplomat was assigned first to India and later several times to China. And when we were living in India in the late 80s, I started to perceive that um a lot of the political discussions there had kind of economic underpinnings that people weren't paying that much attention to. So I started to get interested in economics and when we moved to China in the early 90s it was right about the time that **Dunia** had launched his nonshin which resto uh restarted reform after the uh lapse um and so it's very interesting time to be in China to witness the transformations that were going on in the economy and the business environment and I kind of got hooked. So after doing that for a number of years on a freelance basis. I set up a company in Beijing in 2002 to, you know, do a more formal um uh be able to study the Chinese economy more formally. And that's, you know, that's where it's where I've been for the last almost a quarter century.

</details>

**主持人**: 太棒了。是什么促使您写了那本书？我真的很喜欢您的书，老实说，我第一次看到您的书时就读了，这是我读过的第一本不过多强调意识形态的中国经济书籍。您知道，很多关于中国经济的书，无论是英文还是中文，要么是亲**中国共产党**政权，要么是反对它，没有一个平衡的观点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Awesome. Like what kind of um lead you to write that book? I really like your book and to be honest like the the first time I saw your book I read it this is the first book I read about Chinese economics without too much emphasize on ideology you know like a lot of books right around like either in English or Chinese you're either pro the CCP regime or you're against it like there's no balanced view like

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的，是的。促使我写这本书的原因是，我当时受**牛津大学出版社**的邀请来写这本书。他们对中国经济方面的内容很感兴趣，我的一些专业的经济学学术界朋友也推荐了我。我和编辑都觉得市场上有个空白，需要一本书来简单描述中国是如何发展到今天的。这大约是在2015年左右，当时中国已经取得了很大的发展，但显然自那以后又发生了很多事情。所以，当时需要一本书，以一种普通人能理解的方式来描述中国是如何发展到今天的。它不是为专家写的书，所以技术性不强，但也很直接，正如您所说，没有意识形态色彩。我想这也是出版社想要的，也是我想写的，因为我同意您的观点，很多关于中国经济和中国正在发生的事情的讨论，最终都变成了关于其政治制度的辩论，人们把政治论点偷偷塞进经济讨论中。当然，辩论中国的政治制度是完全合理的，那是一个值得讨论的话题。但是，我认为很多经济讨论，尤其是在更大众的媒体中，被人们不加质疑的政治假设所污染。所以，我职业生涯中的立场一直是淡化意识形态，努力做到数据驱动，只关注事实。我的一个口头禅是：经济学不是道德剧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Yeah. Yeah. So what led me to to uh to write it was well I was I was um invited by the publisher **Oxford** um to write the volume. They they were interested in doing something in the Chinese economy and a number of my professional economic academic friends recommended me. Um and you know basically what what I and the editor felt was that there was a a gap in the market. There was a need for a book that would simply describe how China had gotten to where it was and this was around 2015. So, uh it had risen quite a lot, but it's not um obviously a lot has happened since then. Um yeah, so there was a there was a need for a book that um would describe China, you know, how it got to where it was in a in a way that was sort of normal people could understand. So it was not intended to be a book for specialists. Um, so less technical but also uh just very straight and as you say non ideological and that's you know I think that's what the publisher wanted and that's what I wanted to write because I agree with you a lot of the discussion about China Chinese economy and what's going on there basically winds up being a debate about its political system and people exactly smuggle political arguments into discussion economics and you know it's it's perfectly reasonable to debate China's political system. That's a that's a worthy topic of conversation. Um but uh I think a lot of the economic discussions particularly in the more popular media get polluted by political assumptions that people don't really question. So my standpoint throughout my career has always been to be to to downplay the ideology um and try and just be data driven and and look at at the facts. And you know, one of my one of my mantras is that economics is not a morality play.

</details>

**主持人**: 完全同意。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Exactly. I totally agree.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 经济学中发生的事情，对社会及其结构等有很多影响。这些都需要考虑在内，但经济力量本身与道德讨论是不同的。我们可以根据经济自身的优点来评估它，而无需涉及一堆价值判断。这通常就是我努力做到的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: What happens in economics is, you know, has a lot of implications for societies and how they're structured and so forth. And um, you know, those need to be taken into account, but economic forces themselves are are distinct from from a from a sort of moral discussion. And it's possible to evaluate an economy on its own merits without getting into a bunch of value judgments. Um, so that's what I generally try to do.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。那么，当您开始写那本书的时候，您在中国生活或访问并进行观察了多少年？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. So by that time when you start to write that book, uh, how many years you've been living in China or like maybe visiting China and doing observations?

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 嗯，我第一次搬到中国是1991年，我大部分时间全职住在那里直到2016年。所以我在那里生活了大约四分之一个世纪，中间有些间隙，但大部分时间都在那里。然后直到2020年，我都是在中国和美国各住一半时间，从那时起，我主要住在纽约。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Yeah. Well, I first moved to China in 1991 and I lived there mostly uh, full-time until 2016. So I'd been there, you know, about a quarter century. Some gaps in there but was most of it and then I was half and half in China in the US until about 2020 and then since then I've mainly been living in New York.

</details>

### 中国经济增长的“低人权优势”论

**主持人**: 明白了。好的。现在我们来深入探讨第一个问题。您看屏幕上这位教授，他的名字是**秦晖**。他来自中国一所顶尖大学，在那里教历史。所以经济学不是他的主要研究重点。但他最近做了一个播客，他基本上认为中国过去30年的经济增长，也就是**邓小平**改变政策之后，主要归因于**低人权优势**。这是他的核心论点。他认为中国的体制通过压制权利，尤其是禁止独立工会，你不能轻易组建工会来谈判工资，以及政府可以不经公平补偿就征用土地（这在20年前经常发生），从而人为地降低了要素成本。这就像美国内战前南方蓄奴州如何胜过北方一样。您同意或不同意这种观点？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Got it. Yeah. Okay. So now I'm going to dive in the first question. You know you see the screen here. Uh this uh professor his name is **Chinuay**. So he's uh from a top university in China like he teach history there. So economics not his major like focus. But recently he did a podcast and he basically argued that the Chinese uh economics uh growth in the past like 30 years I would say like after the you know **tenia** changed the policy it's primarily due to the **low human rights advantage** that's his core argument he thinks that like China's system is artificially lower the factor cost by surprising the rights especially like you ban those independent unions you cannot easily form a labor union to negotiate your wages and also So the government can seize the land without any fair compensation which happens a lot like 20 years ago I'll say. So this is like similar to how the slave holding south out compete the north in America pre the civil war America. Do you agree or disagree with that kind of argument?

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 嗯，我部分同意。我认为**秦晖**是一位非常有洞察力的学者，他的观察对于理解中国运作方式非常深刻。我同意的是，毫无疑问，中国经济模式在很大程度上依赖于国家压制某些成本的努力。所以，关于工会和总体劳工政策的观点是绝对正确的。基本上，从20世纪80年代开始，他们建立了一个体系，允许劳动力自由进入城市，这在**毛泽东**时代是不能做到的，当时城市和农村是严格隔离的。所以，如果你想在城市工作，你可以搬过去，但你不会获得该城市的任何公民权利，无法享受当地的养老金系统或福利系统。这造成了一种不稳定或不安全感，并倾向于降低成本，因为招聘的地区不必承担社会福利等方面的全部社会负担。禁止独立的工会组织和其他措施，确实在过去几十年里使中国的天平向资本倾斜，一定程度上牺牲了劳工的利益。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Well, I agree with it part with part of it, right? And I think **Shinu** is a very insightful scholar and I I think has uh you know very very good observations on um you know how China works. And I what I would agree with is there's no question that the Chinese economic model depends on a lot of um efforts by the state to repress certain costs, right? And so I think the the point about uh labor unions uh and and just sort of labor policy generally is absolutely correct. So essentially starting in the 80s they set up a system where labor was free to move into the cities which it had not been able to do during the **Mau** area when the cities in the countryside were strictly segregated. So you if you wanted to work in a city you could move there but you didn't gain any civil rights in that city. Didn't gain access to the local pension system or the welfare system or anything. Uh and so it created a certain kind of um instability or insecurity. Um uh and it it tended to lower the cost because the localities that were doing the hiring didn't really have to bull the bear the full social burden in terms of social welfare and so forth of of uh hiring these people. Um and the prohibition on independent labor union organization and other things indeed I think has um you know tilted the balance in in China over the last few decades in favor of capital uh at the expense of labor to some degree.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 我认为这是真的。你还可以看看其他方面，比如环境合规成本。多年来，中国的环境成本远低于其他地方，他们愿意承受更高水平的污染。这在几乎所有发展中经济体中都是正常的，并非中国独有。但另一方面是**金融压抑**。政府基本上控制着金融系统，决定资金的投资方向，并能够将融资成本保持在相当低的水平。这再次有利于资本。所以我同意这些论点中的要素。我不同意的是，这可以与美国内战前的南方蓄奴州相提并论，因为当时还有另一个因素，那就是一个竞争激烈的工业体系，它在两个方面具有竞争力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Uh so I I think that's true. Uh you can look at you can look at other things you know um a commonly cited thing is um you know environmental compliance costs costs in China for many years were way lower than elsewhere. They were willing to uh sustain higher levels of pollution. That's normal, you know, in pretty much every developing economy. That's not unique to China. But then the other thing is **financial repression**. Uh and so the government basically controls the financial system, determines where things can be invested um and um um and is able to keep the cost of financing pretty low. And so again, that is a benefit for for capital. So I would agree with those elements of the argument. Where I would disagree is that you could compare this in any way to the the southern United States pre- civil war or anything like that because the other part of what was going on was an intensely competitive um uh industrial system and it was in competitive in two ways. Mhm.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 首先，国内市场竞争非常激烈，是的，你可以获得廉价的投入，但你必须与所有其他也获得廉价投入的公司竞争，而国家通常不会保证任何一个参与者的成功。因此，为了在这种环境中生存，你必须拥有除廉价投入成本之外的其他东西，因为其他所有人都拥有相同的投入成本。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: One that was there's a very fiercely competitive domestic market where yeah, you can get your cheap inputs and so forth, but then you have to compete against all the other companies that are also getting those cheap inputs and the state generally speaking is not going to um guarantee success to to any one actor. Uh so in order to survive in that environment you have to have something other than cheap input costs because everyone else has the same input costs.

</details>

**主持人**: 正确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Correct.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 其次，他们专注于**出口导向型制造业**。这里的重点是，每一个成功的经济发展故事，无论是日本、韩国、台湾，还是二战后的德国，都依赖于**出口导向型制造业**作为刺激技术升级的方式。你可能会说，这些因素给了中国在全球市场上的不公平优势，我认为这部分是事实。但同样肯定的是，由于出口需求和国内市场竞争的需要，中国企业变得非常有创新力。我认为中国的大部分增长都来自于这种创新和技术升级，而不仅仅是廉价投入。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And then second uh they focused on **export oriented manufacturing**. Um and the point there is that every successful development story Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, um uh Germany after World War II, uh has depended on exportoriented manufacturing as a way of stimulating, you know, **technological upgrading**. And you could say, well, okay, these these things gave China an unfair advantage in global markets, and that's I think partly true, but it's also definitely true that because of the need to export and the need to compete in the in the domestic economy, the companies got very innovative. And I think a lot of China's growth is coming from that that innovation and that technological upgrading, not just from cheap inputs.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯。而且我认为，尤其是在现在，中国已经不再是劳动力最便宜的市场了。你可以从其他南亚国家获得更便宜的劳动力，但中国在某些制造业领域仍然占据主导地位。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Mhm. And also I think especially nowadays like China is no longer the cheapest labor market. You know like you get much cheaper labor from other like South Asian countries but still China still dominates in certain manufacturing areas.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的，这绝对正确。因为中国能够做到的，是的，他们有廉价的投入，但他们也拥有多年的一流基础设施。很少有国家能同时拥有较低的劳动力成本和一流的质量基础设施。现在我认为你今天看到的是，建立这个非常庞大的制造业生态系统的好处正在显现，在这个生态系统中，你可以非常迅速地扩大产品规模。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Yeah that's absolutely correct because what China has been able to do is yeah they have the cheap inputs but they also have first class infrastructure and they have for many years.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以，是的，廉价投入肯定是其中一部分，但只是其中一部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Uh and very few countries have both lower labor costs and first quality uh infrastructure. And now I think what you're seeing today is that the benefits of creating this very large um manufacturing ecosystem where you can scale up products very quickly are are coming to to fruition. Yeah. So yeah, cheap inputs definitely part of the story but but but only a part

</details>

**主持人**: 只是其中一部分。我不知道您是否看到了这种相似之处。我认为中国和美国都有这种类似的双重公民身份状态。您知道，在美国，有很多他们称之为**非法移民**，或者说没有合法身份的移民。这类人对美国市场提供了大量低成本的服务和商品，但美国政府不必承担他们的任何社会福利。在中国，您也有类似的相似之处，对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: only a part. I I don't know if you kind of uh see the similarity. I think like both China and US have this kind of similar dual citizenship um status like you know in US you have a lot of um they call it **illegal im uh illegal immigrants** or like you know like im immigrants without any legal status for that type of person they contribute to a lot of like lower cost service and goods provided in US market but the US government don't have to cover their any social welfare in China you have that similar similarity, right?

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 嗯，是的，我认为这是一个很容易陷入**错误等同**的例子。所以，是的，这两种情况都存在，但规模完全不同。如果你看美国，我认为美国的外国出生人口总数大约占总人口的25%。其中绝大多数人都有合法身份，并拥有完整的合法权利。所以我不知道无证移民人口具体是多少，但我敢猜测，它可能最多只占总劳动力的3%或4%。在中国，城市人口大约有8亿，其中三分之一的人仍然没有完整的户口或居住权。因此，中国处于这种二等劳工状况的人口数量，比整个美国的人口还要多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Well, yeah, this is, I think, a great example of where it's easy to fall into **false equivalence**. So, yes, both of those things exist, but the scale is completely different. So if you look at the United States, I think the the total foreignb born population in the United States is I think about 25% of the total population. And you know the vast majority of those people are documented and um you know have full legal rights. And so I I don't know exactly what the undocumented uh immigrant uh population is, but I would venture to guess it's probably, you know, on the order of 3 or 4% at most of the total workforce. In China, it is still the case that onethird of the population of urban China and the population of urban China is about 800 million people. Onethird of those people do not have full UKO or residence rights.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的。而且从劳动力角度来看，它可能相当于或超过整个美国的劳动力。作为中国劳动力的一部分，这个比例非常非常大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um so the the number of people um uh in China who are in this kind of secondass labor situation is a population greater than the entire population of the United States. Yeah. Um and and on a workforce basis, you know, it's probably equal to the entire equal to or greater than the entire labor force of the United States. And as a share of China's work workforce, it is very very large.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以，是的，这种现象在美国一定程度上确实存在，但规模很小，而在中国，它绝对是核心。我认为这正是**秦晖**的观点所在，这不仅仅是发展过程中的偶然部分，在很长一段时间内，它都是相当核心的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um so yes, this phenomenon does exist to some degree in the United States, but it's tiny, whereas in China, it's absolutely central. And I think that's where **Chin** has a good point that this was this was not just some um incidental part of the uh development process. It was pretty central for a very long time.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

### 中国经济与日本、苏联模式的比较

**主持人**: 好的。那么，第二个问题变得非常有趣。很多人都在争论，当前的中国债务问题，也就是经济下行，很多人将其与日本房地产泡沫破裂后的情况相提并论。但另一位在美国非常有声望的学者，**许成钢教授**，他认为中国目前的状况更像是20世纪70年代的苏联。他的论点是，中国没有独立的工会或任何集体谈判权，而且政府无法真正转向消费模式，并且正在触及他们所说的**制度天花板**。他认为这是一种硬性的**制度天花板**，而不是简单的市场周期。因此，他认为如果政治体制不进行彻底改革，将会耗尽所有的经济潜力，并压制效率。您认为他的论点，我知道这有点偏向意识形态，但您认为他的论点正确吗？或者说他的类比合理吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Okay. Then uh the second question becomes very interesting like a lot of people kind of argue like the current Chinese um debt problem you know like the economic downturn a lot of people analyze it to uh similar to Japan what happened like after their uh real estate bubble um burst but also uh another scholar he's also a very reputable one uh in US uh **professor Shu** he argued that like China's current situation is like the Soviet union in the 70s. Uh the argument he had is like you know um China doesn't have those like independent labor union or any collective bargaining rights and also you have this uh government that's like cannot really pivot to the consumption model and really hitting uh they call it I don't I don't like **institutional ceilings** like in the system it's it's a hard **institutional ceiling** instead of just like hitting a market cycle and that's why he argued that the political system if not really fully reformed is going to exhaust all the economic potential and really kind of suppress efficiency now like do you think his argument I I know it's a little bit tilted towards ideological part but like do you think his argument is correct or his uh analogy is like a reasonable

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的，如果您不介意我花点时间，我想分别讨论这两个比较：**资产负债表衰退**和**制度天花板**。因为它们都非常普遍，人们支持它们的原因也是可以理解的。我实际上不同意其中任何一个。从根本上说，我认为中国是一个比90年代的日本或后期苏联更具活力和韧性的体系，因此其前景要强劲得多。让我解释一下原因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Yeah well if you if you don't mind me taking a little while I want to address both these two comparisons separately the **balance sheet recession** one and the **institution ceiling** one because they're both pretty widespread and it's understandable why why people you know uh support them. I I don't really disagree I don't really agree with either one of them. So um and you know so fundamentally I think that China is a much more dynamic and resilient system than either Japan of the 90s or the Soviet Union in its late era and so its prospects um are are much stronger. So let me explain why. Mhm.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 关于日本，这是两三年前中国从新冠疫情中恢复乏力时，西方经济学家中常见的比较。当时地方政府和国有企业的债务问题变得非常突出。所以当时的想法是，你看，1990年的日本，他们有很多债务，房地产大崩盘，经济停滞了大约15年，经历了失去的十年，增长非常缓慢，还有通货紧缩。而中国，在一些人看来，基本上也在走向同样的事情。我认为这有几个原因是不对的。最核心的原因是，如果你看1990年左右日本的金融结构，它有一个我称之为**统一的国家资产负债表**。也就是说，金融公司（银行）持有工业公司的股权，工业公司也持有银行的股权。所以存在这些交叉持股。在经济好的时候，这非常有益，因为工业公司可以获得廉价融资等等。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: So, Japan um this was a comparison that was common among western economists two or three years ago when China had a very anemic uh recovery from the COVID pandemic. Um and you know the debt problems of the local governments and um the state enterprises became you know very prominent. Um and so the idea was look, you know, Japan in 1990 they they had a lot of debt. They had a big real estate collapse. The economy stagnated for about 15 years. It took a lost decade of very low growth and deflation. And China according to some people was, you know, basically headed to the same thing. Um, and I thought this was wrong for several reasons. The the central one is that if you look at the financial structure of Japan circa 1990, it had what I would call a **unified national balance sheet**. Mhm. Uh which is to say that financial companies banks owned equity in industrial companies. Industrial companies owned equity in the banks. So there were these cross shareholdings. And when times were good, this was very beneficial because the industrial companies could get cheap finance and so forth. Um

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 但所有这些**统一资产负债表**的底部是土地价值的暴涨。20世纪80年代，日本的土地价值增长了大约600%。到1990年，人们普遍根据公司拥有的土地价值来评估日本公司，而不是根据它们的利润或业务，对吧？问题在于，这些土地价值只是被金融泡沫支撑起来的。当它们崩溃时，最终下跌了大约80%，这意味着不仅工业公司，整个金融部门的股权价值也随之缩水，因为一切都建立在土地价值的基础上。当工业公司倒闭时，金融公司也倒闭了，因为它们的很大一部分价值在于它们持有的工业公司股份。所以所有人都被捆绑在一起，一起沉没。中国从未允许这种情况发生。他们从未允许工业和银行之间进行交叉持股，正是出于这个原因。他们看到了这个问题，也看到了韩国的类似问题。他们说绝不能让这种情况发生在中国。所以，是的，自2020年以来，中国确实发生了房地产危机。这对房地产开发商不利，对地方政府也不利。但它对金融系统，特别是那些没有大量房地产敞口的大型系统性银行，影响微乎其微。它对科技公司，比如**华为**和**比亚迪**（BYD）等，更是零影响，它们完全没有受到影响，因此可以进行大规模投资。所以，如果你看看20世纪90年代日本发生的事情，是投资全面崩溃。而在中国，2020年之后你看到的是房地产投资崩溃，以及制造业投资的巨大繁荣。这是一种完全不同的动态，并带来了更积极的结果。所以我认为这是中国和日本之间的核心区别。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: But at the bottom of all of this **unified balance sheet** was land values that had just exploded. So land values in in um Japan increased by about 600% during the 1980s. And by 1990, it was common to value Japanese companies not by their profits or what they did, but how much land they own and how much that land was worth, right? Um and so the problem was that those land values had just been propped up by a financial bubble. And when they collapsed and ultimately they failed by about 80%. What that meant is that the equity value not only of industrial companies but also the entire financial sector also shrank because everything was built on this this um uh basis of land values. And when the industrial companies collapsed, the the financial companies also uh collapsed because much of their um value was in the shares that they owned in the industrial companies. So everyone was tied together and they all sank together. China has never allowed that. They've never allowed cross shareholdings between industry and banks precisely for this reason. They saw that problem. They saw problem similar problems in Korea. They said never let that happen here. So yeah, you wound up with a real estate bust in China since 2020. And that's bad for the real estate developers. It's bad for the local governments. Uh it basically has very little impact on the financial system. Uh particularly the big systemic banks who did not have large real estate exposures and it had zero impact on the the tech companies, you know, the the **Huawei's** and the **BYDs** of the world. Uh they were totally unaffected and so they could invest massively. Uh and so if you look at what happened in Japan in the 1990s was that there was a collapse in investment across the board. In China, what you saw after 2020 was a collapse in investment in real estate and a gigantic boom in investment in manufacturing. So it's a completely different dynamic and has led to a much more positive result. So that's I think the central difference between China and Japan.

**Oscar Krberg**: 关于苏联**制度天花板**的论点，这基本上是对我来中国以来就一直存在的论点的一种重新包装。我第一次来中国是1985年，当时是作为游客。自20世纪80年代改革开放以来，人们就一直在说：“你看，你有一个充满活力的、有点资本主义的经济，有一个庞大的私营部门，上面还有一个列宁主义的、威权主义的、中央集权的政府。这两者根本不兼容，其中一个迟早会崩溃。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: The Soviet **institutional ceiling** argument is sort of a repackaging of an argument that has been around for basically as long as I have been going to China. And I first went to China in 1985 as a tourist. And since the beginning of reforms in the 1980s, people have said, look, you've got this dynamic, you know, re somewhat capitalist economy with a big private sector and you have this Leninist authoritarian centralized government on top. These two things are fundamentally incompatible and one of them is going to break.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 很长一段时间以来，人们都说，经济系统会打破政治系统，他们将不得不进行政治改革。而反驳的观点一直是，不，政治系统会扼杀经济，他们会停止增长，对吧？你知道，过去40年来，这种论点的每一次迭代都被证明是错误的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And so for a long time people said, well what's going to happen is the economic system will break the political system and they'll have to do political reform. And you know the the counterargument has always been no that the political system will strangle the economy and they'll stop growing, right? You know, and every iteration of this argument for the last 40 years has been wrong.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，我知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah, I know.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 经济继续增长。它现在是世界第二大经济体。虽然有所放缓，但它仍然是世界上增长最快的经济体之一。它现在是世界上最大的制造商，最大的贸易国，与世界其他地区动态融合。而**中国共产党**仍然牢牢掌握着控制权，似乎没有要离开的意思。所以，仅仅因为一个论点在45年里都是错误的，并不意味着它将来不会是对的。但你确实需要问自己，这里到底发生了什么？我认为这种观点忽略的是，如果你再次审视中国政治经济制度的结构，你会发现它们长期以来与苏联的制度非常不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: You know, the economy continues to grow. Uh it's now the second biggest in the world. Slowed down, you know, a bit, but it's still one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Um, it, you know, is the world's biggest manufacturer, biggest trading nation, very dynamically integrated with the rest of the world. And the **Communist Party** is still very much in control and uh doesn't seem to be going anywhere. So, just because an argument has been wrong for 45 years doesn't mean that it couldn't be right in the future. But you do have to ask yourself, yeah, okay, what what's going on here? And I I think what this ignores is um again if you look at the structure of Chinese institutions political economic institutions for a very long time they have been very very different than they were in the Soviet Union.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 即使回到计划经济时期，如果你将**毛泽东**时代的中国与**赫鲁晓夫**或**勃列日涅夫**时代的苏联进行比较，中国远没有那么中央集权。中央政府控制的价格要少得多。你有一种非常分散的理念，每个地方都必须生产自己的所有东西，因为**毛泽东**担心中国会被入侵。所以他希望各地都有重复的工业基础设施。所以，实际上，它在形式上是中央集权的，但实际上更加分散，中央政府对地方层面的控制力要小得多，即使在**毛泽东**时期也是如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Even going back to the plan period if you compare **Mauist China** to the Soviet Union during **Krushchov** or **BRP's** time China was way less centralized the central government controlled far less prices. You had this very distributed um idea where each locality had to produce all its own stuff because **Mao** was was paranoid that China would be invaded. So he wanted there to be duplicate industrial infrastructure everywhere. Um uh so it was in fact it was formally centralized but it was in fact much more decentralized and the central government had le much less uh sway over what was going on at the at the local level even during ma

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 这意味着，当20世纪80年代实行自由化时，许多地方行为者，包括政府和私营部门，在他们能做什么方面完全不受限制，他们只是说“现在可以赚钱了，我们去赚钱吧”，于是他们就去做了。所以那是一个非常不同的基线条件。其次，如果你看看中国发展经济的方式，他们非常清楚地表示，他们希望避免苏联的陷阱，他们对此进行了仔细研究。所以，他们再次专注于**出口制造业**，他们向外部世界开放，没有追求**自给自足**，而这正是苏联所做的。他们非常非常勤奋地专注于如何创造不同的技术转让机制来提升自身能力，而且正如我所说，他们长期以来拥有一个更具竞争力的经济。所以，中国经济与苏联或俄罗斯经济在任何时候的任何迭代都毫无相似之处。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And what that meant was that when you liberalize in the 1980s there were a lot of local actors both government and private sector that were completely unconstrained in what they could do and they just said oh it's now okay to make money let's go make money and so they did. Um so that was a very different baseline condition right uh and then second if you look at the way that China has tried to develop its economy they've been very very clear that they wanted to avoid the pitfalls of the Soviet Union which they've studied carefully so again they focused on **export manufacturing** so they open to the outside world they did not uh pursue **autarchy** which is what the Soviet Union did uh and they focused very very um diligently on how do we create different mechanisms for technology transfer to upgrade our abilities and they've uh you know had as I said a a much more competitive economy for a very long time. So it is the Chinese economy bears no resemblance whatsoever to any iteration of the Soviet or or Russian economy at any point in time.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 现在，我认为**许成钢教授**指出的，而且我认为他在这方面绝对正确的是，好吧，也许这在一段时间内是正确的，但显然在**习近平**领导下，权力出现了非常强烈的**中央集权**趋势，国家权力增强，私营企业家和私营部门的权力减弱，资本配置更多地回到了国家手中，而不是非银行金融机构等。所以，是的，与十年前相比，今天的体系是否更加中央集权、更加威权、更加国家主导和控制？绝对是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Now I think I think what **professor Hugh** is is pointing out and I think he's absolutely correct in this is that okay maybe this was true for a while but clearly under **Shinjinping** you've had a very strong move to **centralize power** uh to increase the power of the state reduce the power of private entrepreneurs and the private sector put capital allocation much more back in the hands of the state than in these non-bank financial institutions and so forth. So yeah, is the system more centralized, more authoritarian, more state directed in control today than it was 10 years ago? Absolutely.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 这种日益增长的中央集权和国家控制是否会慢慢扼杀中国的创新和创造力引擎？绝对有这些风险，我认为指出这些风险是完全恰当的。而且我认为，如果你看看中国过去十年的增长表现，非常清楚的是，随着这种中央集权的发展，中国的增长开始放缓，其中一部分是自然原因，但我认为过去几年，非常清楚的是，中国的增长速度低于其潜在水平，其潜在增长率比我们实际看到的要高一两个百分点。政府和**习近平**似乎认为这没关系，因为技术方面做得很好。所以，我认为指出这种**制度天花板**的风险增加是正确的。但我不得不说，如果你回顾几十年，你会发现中国一次又一次地似乎遇到了各种制度限制，然后系统就会进行调整，以保持增长和技术进步。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And does that increased centralization, state control that you slowly start to suffocate the the engines of of innovation in China and um and creativity? Absolutely those risks are there and I think it's totally appropriate to point those out and I think if you just look at China's growth performance over the last uh decade it's very clear that as this centralization you know grew China started growing slower and part of that was natural but I think the last several years uh it's very clear that China is growing slower than it potentially could its potential growth rate is a point or two higher what we're actually seeing. Um, and the government and **Xiinping** seem to think that's okay because we the technology a bit is doing well. Um, so I think I think it's I think it's right to point out that there's increased risk of this kind of **institutional ceiling**. But I have to say that if you look over many decades, what you find is that time and again, China has seemed to run up against institutional limits of one kind or another. And then the system has adjusted in order to keep growth and and technological progress going.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 而你今天在中国制造业部门看到的情况基本上就是这样。是的，如果你是一名互联网企业家，你的生活现在比七八年前差很多。但如果你从事技术导向型制造业，你的问题不是政府在挤压你，你的问题是来自其他所有人的巨大竞争压力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um and what you see in the manufacturing sector in China today is is basically that. Yeah. If you're an internet oper entrepreneur, your life is bad now compared to what it was seven or eight years ago. But if you're in technology oriented manufacturing, your problem is not that the government is squeezing you out. Your problem is that you have this just incredible competitive pressure from everyone else.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 在你的行业里。所以，这是一种“打了兴奋剂的资本主义”的问题，如果你愿意这么说的话，而不是一个过度压迫的政府。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: In your sector. So, it's a it's a it's a problem of sort of uh **capitalism on steroids**, if you will, as opposed to uh an an overly oppressive government.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。我认为这种说法改变了很多。我认为近年来，两三年前，有很多互联网KOL在播客上发表文章说：“哦，现在是国家时代了。”用中文说就是“国进民退”，意思是国有企业将拥有一切，私营企业可以退出舞台，现在是我们的表演时间了。但我认为现在他们收回了这种说法，因为很多小企业主都感到害怕，他们只是逃离了这个国家，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. I I think like the the rhetoric changed a lot. I think in recent years uh I believe like two or three years ago there's a lot of like um you know internet koss they came on to podcast and published articles saying oh now it's a state time you know like it's a in Chinese it called **国进民退** which it means like the state state company is going to own everything like private company they can just like exit the stage it's now it's our show now but I think like the right now nowadays they pull back that rhetoric a lot because a lot of like you know small business owners or they're scared and they just like flee the countries, right?

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的，没错。如果你和上海或北京的商界人士，特别是那些在2000年代和2010年代做得很好的人交谈，他们对目前的状况非常不满。他们非常不满意政府没有给予更多的自由，政府在总体上没有更支持增长。而且毫无疑问，如果你每月阅读经济数据，中国存在非常严重的**信心问题**。消费者、家庭都不想购买东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Yeah. No, and it's absolutely true that if you talk to, you know, people in the business class in Shanghai or or Beijing and particularly people who did well in the 2000s and the 2010s, you know, they are very very disgruntled with the current state of affairs. They're very unhappy that the government is not um allowing more freedom and the government is not more progrowth in a general sense. Uh and and there's absolutely no question if you just read the economic data from month to month. China has a very significant **confidence problem**. Consumers, households, they don't want to buy stuff.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 他们都在存钱，而不是花钱。私营企业非常不愿投资，特别是如果他们生产的是面向消费者的产品和服务，因为他们看到消费者一直在**消费降级**。所以毫无疑问，与几年前相比，现在存在严重的信心不足。我只是认为，尽管这个问题很严重，但中国是一个大国，经济中有一些在全球范围内具有重要意义的板块，比如科技工业部门，它们表现得非常好，对这些企业家来说，问题不是缺乏信心。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: They're holding back and saving all their money, not spending it. And private companies are very very reluctant to invest. Um you know particularly if what they're producing is sort of consumerf facing products and consumerf facing services because they just see consumers like downgrading their conception all the time. So there's no question that you've got a a significant lack of confidence relative to what you had um several years ago. I just think that as as bad a problem as that is, China is a big country and there are, you know, big chunks of the economy that are globally significant, you know, essentially in the **tech industrial sector** which are doing extremely well and where the the problem for entrepreneurs is not a lack of confidence, right?

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 问题只是异常激烈的竞争。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Uh the the problem is just an extraordinary amount of of competition

</details>

**主持人**: 竞争。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: competition. Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的，他们必须非常努力地工作，但你知道，如果你看看**比亚迪**（BYD）、**小米**（Xiaomi）或**宁德时代**（CATL）等公司的领导者，他们散发出一种自信，认为他们拥有真正征服世界的产品，而且他们可能说得对。但他们日常的生活却不那么好，因为所有竞争对手都让他们很难维持盈利水平。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Yeah. they have to work very hard but it's that you know you look at the people who are leading companies like **BYD** or **Xiaomi** or **CL** or any of these companies uh they exude comp confidence that they have literally worldconquering products and they're probably right but their life dayto-day is kind of not so great because all their competitors are making it very very hard for them to you know keep the level of profitability they buy Yeah,

</details>

**主持人**: 我同意。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I agree.

</details>

### 消费与投资失衡

**主持人**: 好的。现在我们来讨论下一个问题。我认为这个问题会很有趣，因为我认为所有经济学家都建议中国增加消费。甚至美国政府也向中国施压，要求其经济从出口导向型转向消费导向型。**许成钢教授**认为，由于中国当前的分配政策，即如何将财富分配给全国所有公民，很难真正说服所有中国人，是的，我们将鼓励消费模式。因为他们要么没有钱，要么对经济没有信心，担心如果他们花钱，一旦经济崩溃，国家会袖手旁观，对吧？比如，如果再次发生新冠疫情，或者泡沫破裂，你失去了房子，失去了工作，你该怎么办？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. Now, uh let's move on to the next question. I think that this question is going to be interesting because I think everybody like all the economists was like kind of recommending China is like increase your consumption. Even the US government I think kind of pressure China to kind of transform the economy from export oriented towards consumption oriented. I think **professor Shu** argued that um you know because of the current uh Chinese um distribution policy like how you kind of distribute the wealths among all the uh citizens in the country. It's very difficult to actually convince all the Chinese that yeah, we're going to encourage a consumption lab model because of that. Like they just don't have the money or they don't have the confidence in the economy that when they spend that money, the state is going to hold them back if like the bottoms falls out, right? Like if you have another co hit or like there's a bubble burst and you lost your house, you lost your job, like what you do, right?

</details>

**主持人**: 没有多少福利可以支撑他们。这就是为什么很多中国消费者非常不愿消费，他们实际上转向了购买低价商品，对吧？是的，**消费降级**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: There's not much welfare to kind of hold them up. That's a reason like a lot of consumer in China are very reluctant to spend and they actually pivot towards like you know they called call it uh transition to a lower priced goods like right yes downgrade downgrade of the consumption

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: **消费降级**，没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: consumer downgrade that's right

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，**消费降级**。那么您如何看待当前的情况，以及分配制度中的所有冲突？如果国家或北京拒绝在政治上赋予所有工人权力，比如给予他们工会权利，增加他们的收入，或者提升他们的财产权，比如给予他们永久的财产权。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: yeah consump downgrade so what do you think about the current situation and also all the you know conflict among that distribution system like if the state or the Beijing does refuse to empower all the worker like politically like give them the union rights increase their earnings or like boost their property rights like give them like a permanent property uh ownership.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么，呼吁提振国内消费就只是空谈，而不是真正有意义的。您怎么看？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Uh calling for this boosting domestic consumption is simply rhetoric instead of really anything that holds water. What do you think?

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的，我不得不说，这是一个非常混乱的讨论。首先，人们对中国经济中所谓的**消费不足**已经评论了几十年了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Yeah, this is a very messy discussion I have to say. Um so the first observation is okay so people have been commenting on the so-called **lack of consumption** in the Chinese economy you know for decades

</details>

**主持人**: 几十年了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: for decades.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的。他们指出的是，如果你将经济分为投资和消费这两个主要组成部分，你会发现中国经济中投资的份额非常高，而消费的份额按国际标准来看非常低。中国统计数据构建方式存在一些技术问题。我认为他们低估了真实的消费率。它可能比数据中报告的要高出五六个百分点。即使你进行这种调整，它仍然偏低。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Right. Um you know and what they point to is if you look if you divide the economy into you know investment and consumption those are the two main components of it. We'll see the Chinese investment the share of Chinese economy that's investment is very high the share of Chinese economy that is that is consumption is very low by international standards. So there's some technical problems the way the Chinese statistics are cons constructed. I think they underestimate the true consumption rate. It's it's probably five or six points higher um than than is reported in the in the in the data. Even if you make that adjustment, it's still on the low side. Um

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 但事实是，从2000年到2020年，哪个经济体的家庭消费增长率最快？是中国，而且遥遥领先。所以，我认为中国家庭消费在这二十年间增长了六倍。你看看另一个高增长的新兴经济体印度，其增长率只有中国的四分之一。你看看任何一个发达经济体，都远低于中国。所以，说中国消费增长疲弱是错误的。他们实际上拥有极其强劲的消费增长，任何了解20年前中国城市生活水平和今天生活水平的人，都会发现根本无法比较。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: But it's also the case is what what economy had by far by far the fastest rate of household consumption growth from 2000 to 2020. It was China. And it was not even close. Right? So the um uh I think Chinese household consumption grew sixfold during that those two decades from 2000 to 2020. You look at another high growth you know emerging economy India it was I think the growth was you know a quarter of that. You look at any you know advanced economy is way lower. So it is it is false to say that China has had weak consumption growth. They've had actually extremely strong consumption growth and you know anyone who is aware of what the standard of living was in China urban China 20 years ago and what it is today there's just no comparison.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以，我认为这是我们首先需要阐明的一点，当人们说中国消费疲弱时，这在绝对意义上并不真实。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um, so I think that's the first thing that we need to to stipulate is that when people say China's consumption is weak, that isn't actually true in absolute terms, right?

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 从你描绘的整个经济结构和消费份额来看，这是真实的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: It's true in terms of some uh uh picture that you draw of the structure of the whole economy and and the share of consumption. Mhm.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 而且，我认为更准确的说法是，不是中国消费太少，而是它投资太多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And um you know I think what's more accurate to say is that it's not that China consumes too little that it invests too much. Right.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以，这是根本问题，即国家的构建方式。国家基本上控制着金融系统。经济中所有多余的资金基本上都流入了国家控制的机构，并首先分配给投资需求。而且这些投资是战略性的。换句话说，他们不是在问“未来两年哪项投资能带来最高的财务回报”，这基本上是美国等国家的运作方式。他们问的是“国家希望在未来20年支持哪些战略性产业？”让我们投入大量资本，然后希望它最终能奏效，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: So um this is the fundamental issue that the way the state is constructed you know the state essentially controls the financial system. All the excess money in the economy essentially flows into state controlled institutions and it is allocated to investment needs first and the investments are strategic. So in other words, they're not saying what is what is the investment that's going to get us the highest financial return in the next two years, which is basically how it works in a country like the United States. They say what are the strategic industries that the state wants to support over the next 20 years? Let's put a bunch of capital into them and, you know, hope it eventually works, right?

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 这样做的结果是，从家庭中抽取大量资金，用于资助基础设施、工业等方面的长期投资。这些投资在长期内可能确实会产生良好的经济回报，但在短期内实际上并不能提供非常好的财务回报。这样做会产生什么影响呢？如果你想想一个美国家庭或一个欧洲家庭，他们有一些闲钱，他们会怎么做？他们可能会投资股市，他们可能会投资能产生某种回报的债券。因此，他们最终总共会获得相当多的金融收入，除了他们的工资收入之外。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: So, what you wind up doing there is um uh taking a lot of money out of the households and using it to finance very long-term investments in infrastructure, industry, and so forth. That may in fact produce a good economic return over a long period of time but actually don't um provide a very good financial return in the short short run and what that does is you know if you think about a US household American household or a European household they have some extra money what do they do you know they might invest it in the stock market um they might invest it in you know bonds that generate certain kind of return and so they wind up in aggregate having quite a bit of financial income in addition to their um uh their wage income.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 在中国，家庭基本上不允许有任何金融收入，因为所有金融收入基本上都被国家征收，并投入到这些长期投资中。我认为这实际上是导致**低消费率**的一个更大原因。也就是说，基本上中国人没有像你预期的那样多的收入，考虑到发展速度。其中一部分与**工资压制**有关，但一部分也与国家征用金融收入而不是私营部门有关。我认为这比人们经常谈论的社会安全网等问题更重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: In China, basically households are not allowed to have any financial income because all financial income is essentially seized by the state and put into these long-term investments. Um and I think that is actually a bigger cause of this **low consumption rate**. Mhm. It's that basically people don't have as much income in China as you would expect given the uh rate of development and and part of that has to do with **wage suppression** but part of it also has to do with the sort of commonandeering financial income by the state rather than the private sector. Um and I think that's more important than often what people talk about the social safety net etc.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 那么，这种情况会改变吗？我会说不会。这不会改变。所以，我同意这个批评的地方是，虽然我认为**消费不足**问题在某种程度上被夸大了，但我认为中国投资和消费之间的平衡基本上是固定不变的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um now is that ever going to change? I would say no. This is not going to change. So where where I would agree with this critique is while I think that the underconumption problem is in a sense overstated, I think the balance between investment and consumption in in China is basically fixed in stone

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 因为这就是政府希望它成为的样子。而且由于他们控制着整个金融系统，他们可以使其成为那样。只要这些投资中的足够多能在长期内产生某种经济回报，那么这个系统就可以继续下去。所以，是的，我与这个论点在很多技术细节上存在分歧，但我实际上同意其结论。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Because that's what the government wants it to be. And because they control the entire financial system, they can make it to be that way. And as long as enough of these investments produce some kind of an economic return over the long run, you know, the system can continue. So yeah, I I make I'm making a lot of sort of technical disagreements with the argument, but the conclusion I actually agree with,

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 也就是说，在未来几年内，中国经济模式几乎不可能从这种投资和出口主导的增长模式，显著转向消费驱动模式。我只是不认为这会发生，因为**中国共产党**基本上已经决定了事情应该如何运作，从他们的角度来看，这非常成功。他们创造了一个庞大的经济体，每个人都比以前过上了更好的生活，中国公司现在在全球范围内越来越有竞争力，涵盖了广泛的技术领域。所以他们会说，这里有什么问题？人们生活得很好，我们已经满足了全球竞争力、国家安全等方面的需求。嗯，这很好，对吧？你知道，经济学家可能会说，但是你牺牲了很多消费者福利。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Which is that there is almost no possibility that within the next few years, we will see a significant shift in China's economic model away from this sort of investment and export-led growth to more consumption-driven model. I just don't see that happening because you know basically the **Communist Party** has decided how things should run and from their point of view um you know it's been very successful they've they've created gigantic economy where everyone you know has a much better life than they used to and Chinese companies are now increasingly you know globally competitive um across a wide range of technologies. So they say what is the problem here? People have a good life, we have addressed our needs for global competitiveness, for national security, etc. Um, it's fine, right? Uh, you know, and so an economist will say, well, but you've left a lot of consumer welfare on the table.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 但是党会说，我们不敢苟同。不，我们对事情应该如何运作有不同的概念。除非这个概念被证明无法运作，否则他们会继续这样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um, but the party will just say, well, we we beg to differ. No, we have a different concept of how things should work. And until that concept is proven not to function, they're going to keep doing it.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。另外，我还注意到一件事，我记得两年前您做过一次讲座，您基本上说中国政府在2008年之后意识到美国模式不是他们想继承的。他们不想效仿，也就是说，他们不希望中国成为一个过度消费驱动的国家，然后出现2008年那样的债务问题。他们想成为像德国那样的国家，对吧？比如，出口导向型。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. Also, the other thing kind of noticed is uh I remember watching a lecture you were giving like um two years ago, you basically said that the the Chinese government realized like after 2008 the US model is not something they want to inherit. They want to follow that like they do not want China to become a over consumption driven and then you have all this uh debt problems like happened in 2008 and they want to be like Germany right like uh like export oriented. Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的，没错。现在有一些细微之处，因为他们自己也有巨大的债务问题，只是主要集中在地方政府部门等。但是，是的，这基本上是正确的。他们已经决定，他们想成为我所说的“列宁主义的德国”，也就是说，一个技术出口导向型经济体，拥有庞大的制造业部门，但不是社会民主主义的，而是列宁主义的。这就是他们的模式。

<details>

**Oscar Krberg**: Right. Yeah. Now there's some you know there there's some nuances on that because they have their own huge debt problems. They're just in the you know the local government sector etc. But uh but yeah that's that's basically that's basically right. They've decided that they want to be more of what I call a **Leninist Germany** that is to say a technology export oriented economy with a huge manufacturing sector but you know not social democratic but lex that's their that's their model.

### 贸易战与产能过剩

**Oscar Krberg**: 这实际上是一个有趣的切入点，可以引出下一个问题，因为您提到了中国政府有这种产业政策，希望投资制造业和高科技领域，以推动全球竞争力的公司。然而，您看到美国和中国之间发生了**贸易战2.0**，去年就发生了，对吧？就像**特朗普**重返办公室时一样。现在看来，中国与欧盟和其他国家的贸易战，或者说贸易冲突，正变得越来越多地成为头条新闻，您在新闻中也看到了，对吧？中国的**产能过剩**绝对是一个问题，您知道，像您提到的**小米**（Xiaomi）这样的公司，竞争力超强，如果把它放在北美，可能所有其他电动汽车公司都会被淘汰。但它又在中国，而且不只有一家**小米**，还有**比亚迪**（BYD）和其他电动汽车制造商，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: It's actually an interesting point to pivot to the next question because you mentioned about like the Chinese government had this industrial policy want to invest in manufacturing sector high-tech sector to drive you know global competitive competitive companies. However, you see like uh US and China has a **trade war 2.0** you know like happened last year right like when **Trump** uh returned to the office and now it seems like China's trade war like all like I would say like trade conflict with European Union and other countries are just getting more and more like uh headlines you see the news right and the Chinese **overcapacity** is definitely a problem you know like the some of the company like **Xiaomi** you said like super competitive it's like if you put it in North America probably all the other electric vehicle company will be killed but again it's in China and there's not only one **Xiaomi**, there's also **BYD** and other car EV manufacturers, right?

</details>

**主持人**: 所以中国似乎确实存在**产能过剩**问题。**秦晖教授**使用了一个概念，他称之为“**霍内克寓言**”。他基本上说，如果一个像东德那样的极权主义政权与所有西方文明国家自由贸易，同时压制其工人的条件，那么你就会对民主国家拥有不公平的优势，最终这些国家会开始与你脱钩，因为他们认为无法在公平的竞争环境中胜过你。那么您如何看待这一点？贸易战和所有其他税收政策，以及不同国家的保护主义，会开始损害中国模式吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So there definitely seem to be an **overcapacity** problem in China and **professor Chinuay** use a concept, they call it uh **horncker's fable**. So basically said like if a totalitarian regime like East Germany treat freely with all the western civilized companies uh countries and while suppressing its workers condition you're going to have like uh unc to say unfair advantage over like a democratic countries and then eventually those countries will start to decoupling with you because they think they cannot out compete you in a in a fair um arena. So how do you kind of see that like would that the trade war and all the other like you know tax policies kind of protectionism in different countries starting to hurt the Chinese model.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的，我对这个说法有点怀疑。因为，你知道，过去七八年来，保护主义压力一直在累积，从**特朗普**在2018年发起的**贸易战**开始。公平地说，最初几年并没有产生太大影响，现在也没有更显著。尽管如此，所有这些保护主义压力对中国的出口产生了什么影响？什么都没有。基本上，它们继续增长。对中国在全球制成品出口中所占份额产生了什么影响？什么都没有。它们仍然占全球制造商的20%以上。总体贸易顺差已增至超过一万亿美元。如果你只看其中的制成品部分，那规模更大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Yeah, I'm I'm a little skeptical of this story. Um because, you know, you've had protectionist pressure building for the last, you know, seven or eight years, starting with the the **trade war** uh that **Trump** launched in 2018. Now, in fairness, you know, for the first few years really didn't add up to much. It's no more, you know, significant. Nonetheless, you know, all of this protectionist pressure, what has it done to China's exports? Nothing. Basically, they continue to grow. What has it done to China's share of global manufactured goods exports? Nothing. They still account for, you know, over 20% of global manufacturers. They run the the overall trade surplus, you know, has grown to over a trillion dollars. If you just look at the manufactured component of that, it's even larger. Um so um you know if the rest of the world is is thinking that they're going to you know solve their problem with China by being protectionist they're doing a really bad job of it.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以，我认为第一个观察是，保护主义言论和保护主义行动实际上并没有产生那么大的影响。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um so that's I think the first observation is that that protectionist rhetoric and protectionist action has actually not had that much of an impact. Mhm.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 而且我认为你看到的另一件事是，这些技术供应链非常复杂，对吧？尽管有所有的保护主义，你仍然看到世界各地的公司意识到他们需要在中国做事情才能更具竞争力，或者拥有中国供应商。所以，在所有这些所谓的**脱钩**言论压力中，你在基层看到的是，在少数几个行业中，**脱钩**非常非常有限。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um and I think the the other thing that you see is that um um these **technological supply chains** are very complicated, right? And what you continue to see despite all the protectionism is uh companies throughout the world realizing that they need to do things in China to be more competitive or have Chinese suppliers. Um so there's a lot of among all of this sort of rhetorical **decoupling** pressure what you see at the ground level is very very limited decoupling in a few sectors. Mhm.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 一个很好的例子是美国的**自动驾驶**技术，对吧？那里的行业领导者是**Waymo**。他们有多个车辆来源，但其中一个主要来源是中国公司**吉利**（Geely）的**极氪**品牌。他们并没有真正宣传这一点，而且他们规避关税的方式，我认为是，汽车在配备了**Waymo**的所有自动驾驶设备之前，本质上不是一个完全正常运行的单元。所以他们基本上从**吉利**那里获取汽车的核心部件，然后他们再把所有设备安装在上面。这仍然有点昂贵，他们正在寻找其他选择，但是美国和中国的科技生态系统之间仍然有很多持续的来往，因为它们仍然需要彼此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um, you know, a a great example of this is auto **autonomous driving** in the United States, right? So, the leader industry leader there is **Whimo**. Um, they have, you know, a number of places that they source their vehicles from, but a big one is the Chinese company **Gile Ziko** brand. Mhm. Um and you know they haven't really advertised this and kind of the way that they get around um the tariffs I believe is that they essentially that the car is not a fully uh functioning unit until it is equipped with all of **Whimo's** um u self-driving equipment. So they they basically take the guts of the car from J and then they uh and then they put all of the equipment on top of it. Still kind of expensive. Uh and they're looking at other options, but um there's a lot of there's a lot of of continued uh you know back and forth between the US and the Chinese tech ecosystems because they they still kind of need each other.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以我基本上认为，首先，中国的竞争优势不仅仅是低劳动力成本，对吧？他们现在拥有的顶尖公司，现在合法地拥有全球竞争力，有时甚至是全球领先的技术。这在电气和电池领域显然是事实。我认为在工业自动化、机器人等领域也越来越是事实。在绿色能源设备领域也显然是事实。你可以一直举例。所以中国拥有非常强大的技术。他们有一个生态系统，能够让技术非常迅速地实现规模化。因此，单位成本基本上通过**规模经济**而降低，他们可以更快地迭代。所以，中国电动汽车的产品周期通常是12到18个月，而西方汽车制造商是三到五年。因此，如果你能更快地将产品推向市场，你就能比竞争对手更好地跟上或预测消费者需求。这并非适用于中国所有行业，我认为我们需要小心，不要假设中国的一切都像电动汽车行业一样，因为事实并非如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um so I I basically think that um first of all that China's competitive advantages are not just low labor cost right they now have the top companies there now legitimately have uh globally competitive or sometimes globally leading technology um this is clearly true in electricals and batteries I think it is increasingly true in things like industrial automation robots etc. Um it's clearly true in green energy equipment. Uh and you can go on and on. Um and so China is has very strong technology. They have an ecosystem that enables the technology to be scaled up very quickly. So the unit costs come down essentially through **economies of scale** where they can iterate much more quickly. So the, you know, the product cycle for a Chinese vehicle, electric vehicle typically is 12 to 18 months compared to three to five years for a western vehicle maker. And so if you can bring products to market much more quickly, you're going to be able to keep up with or anticipate consumer demand much better than your competitor. So this isn't true in every single Chinese sector. And I think we need to be careful about assuming that everything in China is like the EV industry because it's not.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 但在那些领先行业中，中国公司在他们所做的事情上确实非常非常出色，他们拥有非常巨大且多方面的优势，这些优势真的无法通过关税来抵消，除非通过出口禁令，直接说“我们禁止进口你的产品”，这有点像美国所做的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: But in in those leading industries, Chinese companies are just really really good at what they do and they have advantages uh which are very very large and multifaceted and and really cannot be offset by a you know a a tariff unless they could be offset by an export exclusion and just say we are going to ban the imports of your products period which is kind of what the US has done. Mhm.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 大多数国家对此不感兴趣，因为他们想要这些产品。大多数国家没有需要保护的竞争性产业。所以如果中国有最好的产品和最低的价格，他们就会购买。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Uh most countries aren't interested in doing that because they want the stuff. Um you know, most countries do not have competitive industries that they need to protect. So if China has the best product at the lowest price, they're going to buy that.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 你看到的是，中国在从美国市场转向其他市场，特别是在新兴世界市场方面非常成功。他们获得了更低的价格，所以这会伤害他们。但他们获得了销量和市场曝光。所以，我认为中国现在已经如此融入全球经济，其竞争力的来源如此多样，其中许多是由技术决定的。我不认为**脱钩**会奏效。它只有在发生世界大战，迫使每个人都**脱钩**的情况下才奏效，你知道，这以前也发生过几次。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And what you've seen is that China has been very successful at shifting away from the US market to other markets, particularly in the emerging world. Um they get lower prices, so it hurts them. Um but they get the volume and they get the market exposure. So um I think that China is now so integrated in the global economy and the sources of its competitiveness are so diverse and so many of them are technologically determined. I I don't think that decoupling works. It it only works if you have basically a world war which forces everyone to decouple you know which has happened a couple of times before.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 那将在很多层面上都非常糟糕。但除了这种情况，很难看到除了零星的、真正重要的特定供应链之外，能够实现有效、完全的**脱钩**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Uh that would be very bad on many on many levels. But short of that it is very hard to see uh effective fully effective decoupling other than you know here and there you know individual specific supply chains that are really really important.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，也许吧，但在宏观层面，我真的不认为中国会因此而脱轨。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah maybe but on a macro scale um I don't I don't really see China being derailed by that.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 明白了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Got it.

</details>

**主持人**: 而且我认为，这还取决于其他民主国家的总统和他们的政策。您知道，在**拜登**时代，他提倡**友岸外包**技术，基本上是与所有其他拥有类似政府或民主价值观的国家合作，然后将这些供应链分配到那里。我认为当**特朗普**总统上任时，他立即放弃了**拜登**的战略，我认为这在一定程度上实际上对中国有所帮助，因为他与所有国家都发起了贸易战。所以，与**拜登**时代相比，**友岸外包**的竞争优势要小得多，因为其他国家的关税较少。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: And also like I think um it also depends on like uh the other democratic countries um president and their policy you know like during **better** era he's like promoting a **French shoring** technology like **fresh shoring** uh strategy basically working with all the other kind of you know countries that have the similar government or democratic values compared to America and then kind of allocate those supply chain there. Uh I think uh when President **Trump** come into office, he immediately abandoned **Biden's** strategy and just I think that to certain extent actually helps China a little bit on that side because he started a trade war with everybody. So the competitive advantage of like doing the **French roing** is much less compared to the **Biden** era because you have less tariff like from other countries.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的，我认为即使是那样，你知道，我更同情**友岸外包**战略，当然比**特朗普**的做法要好得多，但它的局限性非常大，对吧？我在我的一些出版物中提出的一个观点是，中国拥有一个非常特殊的生态系统，它极其强大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Yeah. And I think even that, you know, I was much more sympathetic to the the **French stoing** strategy um than to what **Trump** is doing for sure, but it it's pretty severely limited, right? And a point that I've made in some of my publications is that China just has a very special ecosystem which is extremely powerful.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 而且如果你想全面与他们竞争，你就必须全面重建那个生态系统。在**友岸外包**模式下，这基本上是不可能做到的，因为每个国家都有自己的利益。你无法协调。它要复杂得多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um, and if you want to compete with them across the board, you would have to recreate that ecosystem across the board. Mhm. It's basically impossible to do that under a **French roing** model because every country has its own interests. You can't coordinate. It's way more complicated.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以**友岸外包**唯一奏效的方式是，你选择少数几个你认为非常重要的行业，不依赖中国的投入，或者不完全依赖。在这些特定行业中，你说：“好吧，我们不选择所有，但选择三四个或五个，并非常有力地去做。”如果给予足够的时间，这可能会奏效。但我认为现在的问题是，正如你所说，**特朗普**基本上已经放弃了那个战略。如果你看看欧洲的激励措施，它们现在非常复杂，因为一方面，他们的很多工业基础正在被中国的竞争掏空，另一方面，美国正在关闭其市场。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: So the only way that **French** works is that you pick a few sectors where you think it's really really important not to rely on Chinese um inputs or not to rely on totally. And in these individual sectors, you say, "Okay, we're going to pick not everything but like three or four or five and and do that really robustly." And that and that could work if you give it enough time. Um but I think the problem now is that as you say that **Trump** has basically abandoned that strategy and if you look for example what are the incentives in Europe they're very mixed right now because on the one hand a lot of their industrial base is getting hollowed out by Chinese competition on the other hand the US is shutting off its markets.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 那么，如果你是欧洲工业，你该怎么办？很多欧洲工业，特别是汽车制造商，会说：“你看，我们不能再真正依赖美国了。所以我们需要加倍投资中国。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: So what do you do if you're European industry? A lot of European industries say particularly the car makers would say well look we can't really rely on the US anymore. So we need to double down on our investments in China

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 这样我们就能紧跟前沿。我们可以利用那里的所有生态系统优势。这就是我们如何在创新上保持领先的方式。这可能奏效，也可能不奏效，但他们这样想是相当可以理解的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Uh stay close to the leading edge. We can take advantage of all of the ecosystem benefits there. And that's how we how we keep ahead uh you know um on innovation you know and that may or may not work but it's pretty understandable why they're thinking that way.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，绝对同意。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah definitely agree. Um

</details>

### 财政刺激与软预算约束

**主持人**: 现在我们来讨论下一个问题。我认为这非常有趣，因为最近北京终于推出了一些财政方案来帮助市场。我想用中文来说，他们称之为“救市”。**许成钢教授**对此非常怀疑。他严格从**软预算约束**的角度看待这些措施。他认为这些钱并不是真正的经济增长刺激，而实际上只是为所有那些地方政府债务提供基本的生命支持，就像您之前提到的，有很多地方政府的**影子银行**活动，他们有很多低质量投资和巨大的债务问题。您同意这种观察吗？即所有这些刺激措施基本上只是为了维持系统运转，而不是真正鼓励更多消费或帮助中国的每一个公民。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Now let's move on to the next question. I think uh this is very interesting because uh recently Beijing is like finally doing some kind of fiscal packages to help the market. I would say like in in the Chinese term they call it **救市** is basically saving the market. And uh **professor Shu** is very skeptical. He viewed those measures strictly through the lens of a **soft budget** um **constraint**. He argued that this money is not a real stimulus for the girls or uh it's actually just a essential life support for uh all those uh local government debt as you mentioned before like there's a lot of local government uh **shadow shadow banking** kind of going on and they have those investment platform which have a lot of lowquality investment and huge debt problem. Do you agree with that um observation like the all the stimulus is basically try to life support the system instead of really try to encourage more consumptions or help the every every like you know citizens in China.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的，我基本上同意这一点。我认为**软预算约束**这个概念，可以追溯到匈牙利学者**亚诺什·科尔奈**（Janos Kornai），他在20世纪80年代或90年代写了一篇非常好的文章，解释了东欧国家在社会主义模式下是如何运作的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Yeah, I basically agree with that. Uh you know I think that the **soft budget constraint** idea this is an idea that goes back to a Hungarian uh scholar **Janos Cornai** um who back in the I think 80s or 90s wrote a very good um explanation of how he was talking about eastern block countries and how they worked under the sort of socialist model.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 这是一个非常强大的概念，我认为它解释了中国正在发生的大量事情。其基本思想是，这些地方政府或国有企业可以花很多钱，最终如果他们做出错误的决定，他们不必承担这些决定的成本，他们不会破产。我认为这仍然是一个非常强大的概念，与中国有关，我认为它准确地描述了所谓的**刺激计划**。所以你可以狭义地谈论这些**债务置换**，或者你可以谈论政府大约一年半前开始实施的更广泛的所谓**刺激措施**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Uh it's a very powerful concept and I think it explains a a ton of what's going on in China. It's basically the idea is these local governments um or state actors can spend a lot of money uh and at the end of the day if they make bad decisions they don't have to bear the cost of those decisions they don't go bankrupt or or whatever. Um and I think that is a very very continues to be a very powerful concept um as relates to China and I think it accurately describes the so-called stimulus program. Um, so you can talk about either of these **debt swaps** narrowly or you can talk about the broader so-called stimulus measures that the government started putting in place about a year and a half ago.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 我从不称它们为刺激措施。我称它们为支持措施。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And I never called them stimulus measures. I said these are support measures.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 它们是为了确保经济活动不会低于某个水平，但它们的目的不是加速增长。但我认为**许成钢教授**在这里指出了一个非常重要的问题，那就是它们不仅没有刺激作用，它们还内嵌了中国存在**产能过剩**问题的一个重要原因。对吧？那么，为什么会有20或30家电动汽车公司大规模生产呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: They're there to, you know, make sure that economic activity doesn't fall below a certain level, but they're not aiming to um accelerate things. But I I think **Professor Chu**, you know, puts his finger on a very important point here, which is that not only are they not stimulative, they they kind of embed a big reason for why you have this problem of **excess capacity** in China, right? So why do you have, you know, 20 or 30 electric vehicle companies

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。以前有一百家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. producing at scale? I mean, they're more used to be a hundred.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的，我指的是那些真正大量生产电动汽车的公司，有20或30家，对吧？可能应该只有四五家。是的，没错。为什么在一个又一个行业中，竞争对手的数量远远超过市场所能承受的？而且这种情况持续了很长时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Yeah. I I'm I'm discounting the ones that that really, you know, exist more on paper, but you know, ones that really produce significant numbers of EVs. There's 20 or 30 of them, right? There probably should be four or five. Yeah. Right. Uh how come you and in industry after industry, you have this situation where there are many many more competitors.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 市场似乎无法承受。这种情况持续了很长时间。其根本原因是**地方政府的支持**。所以如果你是一个地方政府，你需要有地方税收和就业来源，所以你会尽一切可能让你的地方电动汽车制造商、钢铁厂或其他任何企业继续经营。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Than it seems like the market should be able to bear. And this lasts for a really long time. And the basic reason for this is **local government support**. So if you are a local government, you need to have local sources of tax revenue and employment and so you will find everything in your power to keep your local EV maker or steel mail or whatever it is in business

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 这样你就可以收取税收，人们就可以就业，对吧？而且地方政府有很多可用的工具，不仅仅是现金，他们可以免费提供土地，他们可以向当地发电厂施压，说：“好吧，把这家伙的电费削减50%。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: So that you can collect the tax revenue and and the people will be employed, right? And um and because local governments have a lot of tools at their disposal, not just cash, but they can you they can hand out free land, they can lean on the local power plant to say, "Okay, cut this guy's, you know, electricity bill by 50%."

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 或者其他什么。他们有很多非预算机制，可以通过这些机制支持行业，即使公司本身盈利能力不强，也能让它们继续经营。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Or whatever. They have a lot of um non-budgetary mechanisms by which they can support industries and keep them in business even if the company is is intrinsically not very profitable. Mhm.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以，不是正常的过程，即大量新进入者涌入热门行业，然后几年内大多数破产，少数幸存下来。那些本应破产的人却能经营很长时间，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: So instead of a normal process where you have a flood of new entrance into a hot sector and then you know within a couple of years most of them go bankrupt and a few survive the people who should have gone bankrupt stay in business for an incredibly long period of time right

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以，这就是所谓的终极**软预算约束**。现在有趣的是，中央政府已经表示：“哦，这太糟糕了。我们不喜欢所有这些过度竞争。它不能存在。我们必须减少公司数量。地方政府，你们必须停止补贴这些公司。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And uh and so that's kind of the ultimate you know **soft budget constraint** if you will. What's interesting now is that the central government has said, "Oh, well, this is terrible. We don't like all this excess competition. It must not exist. We must have fewer companies. Local governments, you must stop sub subsidizing these companies."

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 但中央政府是否曾攻击过这里的核心问题，即财政系统的设置方式？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: But does the central government ever attack the central issue here, which is the way that the fiscal system has set up.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 首先，它赋予地方政府巨大的权力，将资源输送给这些公司。其次，它给予他们巨大的激励来这样做，因为如果他们不这样做，他们就真的没有预算收入了，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Which number one gives local governments immense authority to channel resources to these companies and then number two gives them immense incentives to do that because if they don't do that then they literally will have no budget revenues right.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 而中央政府对此负有责任，因为他们建立了一个财政系统，使得地方政府除了通过生产税之外，很难产生任何收入。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And the central government is responsible for that because they've set up a fiscal system which makes it very very hard for local governments to generate any revenue except by essentially taxes on production.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 但中央政府不会干预这一点。所以，是的，整个**软预算约束**对经济增长来说是一个问题。它本质上是造成**产能过剩**问题的原因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Uh but the central government is not going to tamper with that. Um so yeah this whole **soft budget constraint** is is a problem for economic growth. It is a it is essentially what creates the **excess capacity** problem.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 归根结底，我认为中央政府对此的看法是，这并不理想。如果只有**比亚迪**（BYD）和**小米**（Xiaomi）以及另外两家公司生产电动汽车并非常盈利，我们会很高兴。另一方面，我们要投入多少精力来重塑系统以实现这一目标呢？不会太多，因为这些公司必须将价格压到最低。这很好，因为这样它们在全球出口市场上更具竞争力。是的，国内消费者的价格也会下降。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And at the end of the day I think the central government's view on this is well this is not ideal. We would love it if you know if there were only **BYD** and **Xiaomi** and two other companies making EVs and being very profitable. On the other hand, how much effort are we going to put into re remaking the system so that happens? Not that much because okay, these guys have to cut their prices to the bone. That's great because then they are, you know, more competitive on global export markets. Yeah. And prices fall for for domestic consumers.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以中央政府，我认为，在这个设置中扮演了非常重要的角色。到目前为止，他们似乎没有强烈的兴趣改变这个系统。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: So the central government, I think, is very much complicit in this in this setup. Um, and so far they do not have a they they appear not to have a strong interest in changing the system.

</details>

**主持人**: 他们能做的就是通过**债务置换**等方式向系统注入更多资金，以确保地方政府保持偿付能力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: What they can do is like shuffle more money into the system through things like these **debt swaps** in order to make make sure that the the local government stays solvent.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。我认为，你知道，由于地方政府的这些政策，你有很多竞争对手，你面临着这种激烈的竞争。如果出现新的市场，比如十年前的电动汽车市场，每个人都涌入，每个城市都有自己的电动汽车制造商，这无疑为发展先进技术创造了大量竞争，因为在这种环境下，如果没有先进技术，你无法生存。但我认为这同时也极大地浪费了纳税人的钱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. I think like the you know because of lo those local government policy you have so many competitor you have this like fierce competition kind of everybody has to lower their price if there's a new market kind of come out like the EV market 10 years ago everybody is jumping in like every city have their own EV manufacturer that definitely create a lot of competition for uh developing the advanced technology because you cannot survive in that kind of environment without any advanced technology but I think that also a huge waste of the taxpayers dollars, you know, like the Oh,

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 当然。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: for sure.

</details>

**主持人**: 这些钱本可以花在其他更具生产力的活动上，比如投资教育，或者努力帮助改善农民的工作环境，努力改善这些人的生活。您不认为低消费的部分原因也是由于这种政策严重倾向于地方投资，而不是？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Those money could be spent on other more productive um activity like investing in the education or try to help improve the um those farmers working environment, try to improve those those people's life. Um don't you think that part of the reason for the low consumption is also driven by this like the policy kind of heavily tilts towards local investment instead of like you know

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 绝对是这样。我的意思是，这又回到了我之前提出的观点，即国家基本上征用了全国所有的金融收入，并将其导向这些投资，而不是让它像在更市场化的系统中那样在经济中循环。所以，我认为这绝对是投资与消费平衡以及增长率问题的核心。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Absolutely that's absolutely the case. Uh I mean this gets back to the point that I made earlier about how basically the state commandeers all of the financial income country and directs it to these investments rather than allowing it to recirculate through the economy the way it would in a in a more market oriented system. So so that is I think absolutely uh at the heart of the question of the investment consumption balance and and also the growth rate.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以，我过去几年一直在努力弄清楚的是，在**习近平**领导下，中国政府显然不像前任领导人那样关心保持高经济增长率。对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: So the thing that I've been sort of trying to figure out for the last few years is it's it's become very clear that under **Xiinping** the Chinese government is much less concerned about maintaining a high economic growth rate than previous leaders. Right.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 以前他们谈论发展，意味着高GDP增长率。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um and when they talk about development it used to be that development meant a high GDP growth rate.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 在**习近平**领导下，这意味着不，它意味着**技术发展**。增长率必须达到一定水平，但不必那么高，对吧？所以我们似乎已经实现了，他们基本上已经实现了一个在许多领域取得令人印象深刻的技术进步，但增长速度慢得多的经济。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Under **shiinping** it means no it means **technology development** um and the growth rate has to be you know a certain level but it doesn't have to be that high right um so we seem to be and they you know and this is essentially what they have achieved is an economy that is making really impressive technological progress in many fields but is growing a lot slower

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 如果你阅读政府文件，他们往往会说：“别担心，所有这些新技术将产生巨大的新生产力收益，这将导致未来更高的增长。”他们是这么说的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And if you read government documents on this what they will tend to say is well don't worry all this new technology will produce enormous new productivity gains and this will you know cause higher growth in the future that's what they say

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 问题在于，中国大多数人并不在科技行业工作，对吧？那么，电动汽车、半导体、工业机器人、绿色能源等所有这些加起来的总就业人数是多少？这可能只占全国劳动力的10%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um and the problem with that is that most people in China do not work in the technology industries right so what's the combined employment of EVs semiconductors industrial robotics you know green energy all of these things put together you know that might be 10% of the of the national workforce Mhm.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以，为了让这种效应溢出到经济的其他部分，也就是其他所有人都工作的地方，你需要有一个机制，让电动汽车制造得很好的事实，能在经济的其他地方创造一些生产力收益。而这正是我开始挠头的地方，因为我真的看不到技术改进的能力，能够转化为大多数人的普遍更高的生产力和更高的工资。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Uh so in order for this to spill over into um you know the the rest of the economy where everyone else works, you need to have some mechanism by which you know the fact that you're really good at making electric cars creates some productivity benefit elsewhere in the economy. And that that's where I start scratching my head because I don't really see the ability um for technological uh improvement uh to feed through into sort of generally higher uh uh productivity and higher wages for most people, right?

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 而且你确实有一个机制，主要是在互联网领域，对吧？在10到15年里，你拥有像**阿里巴巴**和**腾讯**这样伟大的公司，它们是技术创新者，也是巨大的雇主，它们基本上销售的是消费服务。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um and you did actually have a mechanism for that essentially in the internet sector, right? for for 10 or 15 years you had these great companies like **Alibaba** and **Tencent** and so forth that were technological innovators and also gigantic employers and they were essentially selling consumer services.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以在那里你可以看到他们开发的技术和更广泛的收入增长之间有很多溢出效应。而现在这种情况已经大大减少了。所以，中国现在有点像一个两极分化的地方，科技经济表现出色，做得非常好。而整体经济，宏观经济表现不佳。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um and so there you could see a lot of spillovers between the technology that they were developing and and broader gains income. Uh and that is is much less the case now. So, China is now kind of I think a bifurcated place where the technology uh economy is overperforming doing very very well. Um and the over the the total economy, the macro economy is underperforming.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 我真的看不到这种情况在未来七年内会改变的原因。我不认为中国会突然获得更快的增长率。我不认为消费会加速，但我也不认为技术进步会放缓。这只是一种奇怪的组合，即极强的技术能力，在个别领域取得了巨大成功，但整体经济总是感觉有点迟滞。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Uh and I don't really see a reason for that to change in the next seven years. I don't think China is suddenly going to get a much faster growth rate. I don't think consumption is going to accelerate, but nor do I think that the technology progress is going to slow down. It's just this kind of weird combination of extreme technological competence, a lot of success in individual sectors in an overall economy that that always feels a little bit sluggish.

</details>

### 长期停滞与社会福利

**主持人**: 是的。所以，这实际上引出了下一个问题，这非常有趣，因为**许成钢教授**预测中国将面临长期停滞，因为**中国共产党**不会放弃控制。**秦晖教授**则认为，由于没有福利问责制，中国人民不要求政府兑现社会主义承诺，这将导致国家长期停滞。您认为这种预测有道理吗？您认为这种论点站得住脚吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. So, uh that actually bring up to the next question which is very interesting because **Professor Shu** predicts that China is going to face a **long-term stagnation** because the **Communist Party** will not give up control. Um, and **Professor Ching** kind of argued that like there's no accountability for welfare and the Chinese people did not demand the government deliver like social socialist promise that will kind of lead to this long stagnation for the country. Do you think that prediction is holds any water? Like do you think that argument is u sound?

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的，我认为这两种批评，我们都需要非常认真对待，因为我认为它们指出了相当真实的问题。所以，是的，毫无疑问，我的意思是，看看**许成钢教授**的**停滞论**，国家控制的增加，以及将巨额资金投入这些平均生产力非常低的投资所带来的效率成本。所有这些，我认为都增加了停滞的风险。而且你可以争辩说，某种程度上已经存在了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Yeah, I think both of those critiques are, you know, we need to take them quite seriously because I think they they put their finger on, you know, some pretty real problems, right? So yeah, there's no question that I mean looking at **Professor Shu's** um uh **stagnation thesis** um the increase in state control um and the the efficiency cost of just like channeling huge amounts of money into these investments that on average are very low productivity. All of that, you know, creates, I think, a greater risk of stagnation. And and you could argue that there were sort of there already.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以中国，人们谈论实际增长率。这是考虑了通货膨胀的增长率。所以通常情况下，如果一个经济体增长3%，通货膨胀是2%，那意味着你的实际增长率只有1%，因为你必须从名义增长率中减去通货膨胀率，对吧？在中国，现在情况正好相反。名义经济增长率大约是3.5%或4%。物价下跌1%。所以他们声称我们有5%的实际增长。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: So China, people talk about real growth rates. So this is growth rates accounting for, you know, inflation. So normally if you have like an economy is growing by three and inflation is two, that means that your real growth rate is only one because you have to subtract the inflation rate from the from the from the nominal growth rate, right? Um in chi China has the opposite now the the the nominal economy is growing by like three and a half or 4%. The prices are falling by 1%. So they claim oh we have real growth of 5%.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 但这5%中，有一个百分点仅仅来自于物价下跌。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: But that 5% you know one percentage point of it is just coming from falling prices.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 而不是活动增加。因此，从名义上看，中国过去四年来的增长速度一直低于美国。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Not from increased activity. Um so in nominal terms China has been growing slower than the United States for the last four years. Mhm.

</details>

**主持人**: 这有点令人震惊，考虑到他们多年来增长速度远远快于美国。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Which is kind of staggering when you consider that they were growing, you know, way faster than the United States for many years.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 中国经济相对于美国经济的峰值出现在2020年，我认为大约是75%。现在已经下降到大约65%。所以中国经济总量与美国相比，比五年前要小。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: China's economy relative to the US peaked in 2020, I think, at about 75%. It's now down to about 65%. So China's economy in total compared to the US is smaller than it was five years ago. Um,

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以如果你愿意，你可以争辩说中国在某种意义上已经停滞了。现在，这会是一种夸大，因为它仍在增长。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: So you could argue if you wanted to that China is already in a sense stagnating. Now that would be an exaggeration because it's still growing.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 嗯，你知道，以任何标准来看，都相当快。所以，在我看来，那不是停滞，停滞意味着根本没有增长。它显然还在增长，对吧？但是，你知道，现在存在的动态是，增长率远低于应有的水平，或者说可能达到的水平。这种状况持续的时间越长，我认为它造成的风险就越大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um, you know, pretty fast um by any standard. Um, so that's not stagnation in my book would be it's not growing at all and it's it's clearly growing, right? Um but there's you know the the the dynamic that exists now is one where growth is a lot lower than it should be or could be. Uh and the longer that goes on I think the more risk that that creates you know perhaps.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yes.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以，你知道，正如我所说，我比**许成钢**对中国更乐观，而不是与日本或苏联或其他任何比较。我认为他们有很多优势。过去的记录非常好。但是，一个经济体在很长一段时间内（这里我说的是10到20年）的风险，所有这些低效率开始显现。是的，这种风险是存在的，对吧？但再次强调，这不会在未来一两年、三五年内发生。这将是一个更长期的动态。然后，另一个案例是**秦晖教授**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: So I I you know as I said I'm I'm much more bullish than than **Shu Changong** you know on China visa v Japan or the Soviet Union or any of these other comparisons. I think they have a lot going for them. Track record is very good. Um, but the the risk of an economy that that over a long period of time and here I would say you need to be talking about 10 20 years. All of this inefficiency starts to catch up with it. Yeah, that that risk is there, right? But but again, this is not something that's going to happen in the next one, two, three, five years. This is going to be a much longer term dynamic. Um and then um the uh the other uh case was **professor chain**.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。他认为，如果中国想摆脱目前的困境，就必须增加福利份额。对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. He argued that like the if the China want to get out of this current situation they have to increase the welfare share. Right.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 没错。所以，我认为这是一个有趣的论点，而反驳的观点是，你知道，我有一个金融行业的客户最近这样对我说。他说：“你看，你看看美国，这是一个为收入最高的20%人口优化的经济体。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Right. So that's I think that's an interesting argument and the counter to that is that you know I have a one of my clients in the financial industry who recently put it to me this way. He said, "Look, you know, you look at the United States and this is an economy that is optimized for the top 20% of the income."

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以，如果你属于收入最高的20%，美国很棒。你可以做任何你想做的事，赚很多钱，你非常安全，你可以投资，获得丰厚回报，非常棒，对吧？如果你在收入阶梯的下层，情况就不那么好了，对吧？但对于收入最高的20%来说，这太棒了。对吧？中国，他的观点是，恰恰相反，对吧？对于收入在20%或30%的人来说，生活是很好的，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: So, if you're in the top 20%, America is great. You can do whatever you want, make lots of money, uh you're very secure, you can, you know, invest, make big returns, it's excellent, right? If you're lower down in the income scale, it's not so great, right? But for the top 20%, it's fantastic. Right? China, his point was, is the opposite, right? For the 20th or the 30th percentile of income, life is fine, right?

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 你有房子。大多数东西都不贵。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um, you have a house. Uh, most things don't cost very much.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 如果你住在城市，社会福利保障虽然不完美，但也不糟糕。医疗系统比以前好很多。你的孩子能接受不错的教育。你的退休基本上得到了保障。有全民养老金，虽然不多，但总归是有的。你真的不必担心太多。我认为这是一个非常好的观点，对吧？这个系统，是的，就正式的社会福利系统而言，它绝不像美国或欧洲。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Uh, if you live in the cities, social welfare provision is not fantastic, but it's not horrible. There are, you know, the health care system is much better than it was. Decent education for your kids. Uh, your retirement is basically taken care of. They're universal pensions. They're not fantastic, but they're there. Don't really have to worry about much. And um and I think that's a very good point, right? That the system that has been created, yeah, in terms of a formal social welfare system, it's not like the United States or Europe by any means. Mh.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 但是，就为绝大多数人创造安全感和某种保障而言，它运作得相当好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um, but in terms of creating a sense of security and and sort of provision for a large majority of of its people, it works pretty well. Mhm.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以，我不太确定**秦晖**说中国整体社会福利系统像他所说的那样糟糕是否完全正确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um, so I'm I'm not sure that **Chinuay** is quite right in saying that uh the the overall social welfare system in China is as bad as you know like to argue.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 不过我确实认为，如果你以那种方式进行优化，你就会创造出一些反常的激励。基本上，你现在告诉大多数人的是：“好吧，你的生活还不错。而且不会有太多的增长，但是我们命令你对此感到满意。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: I I do think though that if you if you optimize in that way, you are creating some perverse incentives, right? Um, and basically what you're telling the majority of your population right now is, okay, you've got an okay life. Uh, and there isn't going to be that much growth, but we order you to be fine with it.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 而且，你知道，对于很多人来说，他们会觉得：“好吧，我接受这个条件，因为现实是我的生活还不错。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And you know, I think for a lot of people it's like, okay, I'll take that deal because the reality is my life is okay

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: “好吧，我不能指望像一两年前那样的增长。但是，是的，嗯，但这没关系。我可以接受这个条件。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And okay, I I can't expect the same sort of growth that I would have a year or two ago. But yeah, um but that's fine. I I can live with that deal. Mhm.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 但如果你让大多数人接受这样一个条件，即他们只是失去了对改善生活的渴望，我认为这又会让你回到**停滞**的问题。如果人们努力工作，试图改善生活，但却得不到任何回报，那么他们还有什么动力呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um but if you have if you if you make most of your population live with the deal where they just lose that aspiration for making things better, I think that gets you back into this this **stagnation** question. What is the incentive for people to work really hard and try to improve things if they're not going to get anything out of it? Mhm.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以，我认为存在这样的风险，即他们选择组织系统的方式，随着时间的推移，会促使更多的人选择“退出”这个系统。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um and so I think there is a risk there that the that the way that they have chosen to organize the system um creates more incentives for more people over time to just kind of check out the system.

</details>

**主持人**: 他们称之为“躺平”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: They call it lay flat like

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 没错，就是**躺平**现象。我认为就当前的梗而言，这有点言过其实，因为有很多人并没有**躺平**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Right. That's right. It's right. Exactly. It's the **tongue ping** um you know phenomenon. Exactly. Which I think is in in terms of the current meme I think it's a little bit overstated because there's plenty of people who are not mind flat but

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 但我认为中国经济的激励结构现在有点值得怀疑。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: But the you know I think that the incentive structure is in the Chinese economy is now a little bit questionable.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 而且，创业的激励结构显然比十年前弱得多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And the incentive structure for entrepreneurship is clearly much weaker than it was say 10 years ago.

</details>

**主持人**: 哦，是的。我绝对同意这一点，因为我知道中国有很多风险投资家，他们不应该被称为风险投资家。他们实际上是风险债务，因为你必须签署协议。如果你的公司失败了，你必须回购所有的股份。基本上，你背负着巨额贷款，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Oh yeah. I I would definitely agree with that because like I know a lot of uh venture capitalists in China they shouldn't be called venture capitalists. They're actually venture debt because you have to sign agreement. If your company fails, you have to buy back all the share. Basically, you're put on a huge loans, right?

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的，我的意思是，我们可以就中国的风投系统进行一次完全独立的对话，那简直是一团糟。但是，是的，所以，我认为那里肯定存在风险。我只是想说，我对**秦晖**和**许成钢**的这两点基本回应是，风险是真实存在的，我认为它们正在逐渐上升，但它们对中国经济的势头产生实质性影响的速度非常非常慢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Yeah. I mean, we could have a whole separate conversation about the VC system in China, which is like complete mess. But yeah, uh uh but yeah, so that's I I think there are there are definitely risks there. I would just say my my basic response to both uh **Chinu** and **Shu Jang** on this would be that um the the risks are are real uh and I think they are it's kind of at the margin rising but they are very very slow to I I think really have a material impact on Chinese momentum.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，还有另一位教授，他的名字叫**董山**。他最近做了一个播客。他认为中国政府实际上应该发放**全民基本收入**（UBI），基本上是给所有年轻人钱花，因为他认为这个系统对他们来说真的不公平，这就像一种补偿，也鼓励他们生孩子等等。您认为中国政府能做到这一点吗？会做到这一点吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah, there's another U professor called his name is **Dong Shan**. So he recently did a podcast. He's arguing that the Chinese government should actually give out **UBI** like basically give all the young people like uh money to spend because I think like the system is really not fair to them like that's like a compensation and also encourage them to have babies and all this stuff. Do do you think that Chinese government can do that and will do that? I mean

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 嗯，如果他们愿意，他们可以做到，因为他们控制着金融系统。我不认为他们会这样做，我个人也不认为他们应该这样做。所以对我来说，解决这些问题的方式基本上是金融系统更具灵活性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Well they they could if they wanted to because they control the financial system. I don't think that they will and personally I don't think that they should. Right. So to me, the way that these problems get addressed is basically more flexibility in the financial system.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 这使得预算约束更加严格，对吧？所以你有一个金融系统，它真正惩罚那些无法生存的公司，让它们破产。反之，它奖励那些做得非常好的公司，对吧？并奖励那些承担资本风险的投资者，对吧？所以这就是国家征用所有金融收入并将其转移到它想要的地方的全部意义。中国实际上在2017年之前一直在朝着**金融系统去中心化**的方向发展，并创建一个更以消费者为导向的金融和资本配置系统。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: That allows hardens the budget constraints, right? So you have a financial system that really punishes the the companies that that can't, you know, survive and they go out of business. Um and conversely rewards the companies that do really well, right? Uh and rewards the investors who put that capital at risk, right? So this is the whole point about the way that the state commandeers all financial income and moves it where it wants. Where China was actually moving up until about 2017 was to decentralize the financial system and create a more um sort of consumer oriented uh financial and capital allocation system

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 这显然伴随着巨大的风险。但从改善家庭福利和让人们经济状况更好的角度来看，我认为那是正确的方向。关键在于，那是一个动态的、市场驱动的系统，而不是政府说“好吧，我们政府决定你现在将获得X的基本收入”，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And that clearly had significant risks attached to it. But from a standpoint of improving household welfare and making you know people economically better off I think that was the way to go. The and the the point there is that that's a dynamic sort of market driven system not the government saying okay we the government will decide that you will now have a basic income of X right

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 我不认为那真的会改变任何人的激励。它基本上只是现有命令式系统的延续。所以即使他们这样做了，我也不认为它会有那么大的影响，因为我不认为它会真正改变人们的激励。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: I don't think that that really changes anyone's incentives at all uh it it's basically that would just be a sort of a continuation of the existing sort of commandoriented system so even if they did it I don't think it would have that much impact because I don't think people it would really change people's incentives that much Yeah. Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 但我不认为他们会这样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: But I don't think they're going to do it.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Okay.

### 中国经济的未来展望：怀疑的乐观主义者

**主持人**: 我认为**许成钢**和**秦晖**都非常悲观，而且他们对中国的未来持决定论的观点，对吧？他们认为中国就像一列火车在轨道上行驶，无论你做什么，都会走向那个命运，对吧？但我认为您对此更乐观。您认为中国经济比他们认为的更具韧性，对吧？您能给我们一个预测，或者您对未来两三年中国经济将如何表现的看法，甚至是中国股市的表现？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I I think um both **Shu** and **Qing** are very um pessimistic and also they have a deterministic view about China's future, right? Like they think China is like the train on a track that kind of heading toward that destiny uh no matter what you do, right? But I think you're more bullish on that. You think like Chinese economy is more resil resilience compared to what they perceived, right? Can you give us a like maybe u just like a forecast or your your view on like ne maybe in the next two to three years like how the China economy would be behave or even the cap uh the I would say like there people people often like uh want to ask like how the Chinese stock market perform right like that okay

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 好的，展望。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: perspective so okay

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 好的，我首先要说的是，我真的很讨厌被描述为**中国多头**，因为我不是。部分原因只是审美，部分原因是因为我不认为我的角色是站队，支持或反对，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: So the first thing I will say is I really hate being described as a **China bull** because I I don't partly Partly that's just the aesthetic. Partly it's because I don't view my role as being, you know, to take sides in for it or you against it, right? Which is

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 我一直将自己描述为**怀疑的乐观主义者**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um I've always described myself as a **skeptical optimist**.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 意思是，乐观之处在于我对中国系统潜在的优势、韧性和适应性非常有信心。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Meaning, so the optimism is that I have very high conviction in um in the the kind of underlying strengths and resilience and adaptability of the uh Chinese system.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 嗯。而且我还要明确一点，因为我从根本上对经济持乐观态度，这并不意味着我赞同其政治制度。那是两个完全不同的问题，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Mhm. Um uh so and this I I should also be clear that because I'm optimistic at core on the economy, this does not mean that I uh uh give approval to the political system. Those are two completely different questions, right? Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 这两者经常混淆。我认为完全可以说，一方面，这些人真的知道如何管理经济，并且非常成功地动员和部署资源，以实现令人印象深刻的经济目标。这是一个问题，而我对正确的政治制度的价值判断是另一个完全不同的问题。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Which often get mixed up. And I think it's perfectly possible to say on one hand these guys really know how to run an economy um and are very successful at mobilizing and deploying resources uh to achieve you know impressive economic ends. Um that is one question and what would be my value judgment on the the right political system that's a completely different question.

</details>

**主持人**: 我知道，明白了。所以我想对这两个规定保持谨慎。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I know so understood. Uh so I want to be careful about those two stipulations.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 怀疑的部分是，中国总是存在巨大的问题，正如我们讨论过的，即使我不同意您引用的学者的一些结论，但很多分析都是一针见血的，对吧？存在非常非常困难的结构性长期问题，这些问题会降低效率，制造不良激励，无论是在政府层面还是在公司层面。如果这些问题任其发展，是的，随着时间的推移，它们可能会导致经济表现比过去差得多。对吧？当你再加上人口问题等因素时，你知道，中国从年轻人口中受益匪浅。现在它正在迅速老龄化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And so um the skeptical part is that you know there are always huge problems in China and as we've discussed, you know, even though I disagree with some of the conclusions of the of the scholars that you've cited, you know, a lot of analysis is spoton right there are really really difficult um structural abiding problems um which reduce efficiency uh create bad incentives uh both at the government level and at at the company level. And if these are allowed to fester, yeah, they over time uh they could cause the economy to perform much much worse than it has in the past. Right. And when you when you put on top of that things like there's a big big **demographic problem**, you know, China benefited enormously from having a young population. It's now aging very quickly.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。大约15年后，中国的平均年龄将高于日本。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. The the average age in China in in about 15 years will be higher than in Japan.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 这令人震惊。所以，每当你看到如此规模的问题时，你都可以说，好吧，过去他们处理问题做得很好，但是他们能继续保持下去吗？也许能，也许不能，对吧？他们正在做什么来解决他们给自己施加的制度限制？对吧？但是如果我必须，你知道，正如我之前所说，我目前的基本观点是，中国拥有一个伟大的科技经济和一个平庸的宏观经济。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Which is staggering. Um so um so whenever you see problems of that magnitude, you can say okay in the past they've done a great job of dealing with their problems but um can they keep it up? Maybe yes, maybe no, right? Uh and what are they doing to address the institutional constraints that they're putting on themselves? Right? But if I had to um you know and as I've said before my my basic view right now is that China has a great tech economy and a kind of a mediocre macroeconomy.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以我的预测是，你知道，中国实际增长率大约在4%到5%之间，名义增长率大约在3%到4%之间。我认为这在未来几年基本上会继续下去。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um and so my I would do forecasts but my expectation would be you know China's been growing by in real terms around four four to 5% in nominal terms around 3 to 4%. I think that basically continues for the next few years. Mhm.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 这是一个不错的结果，但并不出色。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um which is an okay result but not terrific.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 另一方面，如果你看看科技生态系统，它非常令人印象深刻，我认为它将扩展到新的领域，中国公司将在全球范围内变得更加重要。所以我对中国顶尖公司在越来越多的技术密集型行业中获得领先地位的能力相当乐观，对吧？我认为这非常非常清楚。而对抗这种趋势的力量，无论是保护主义、**友岸外包**还是其他地方的产业政策，都需要很长很长的时间才能产生影响。但中国在这方面拥有非常强大的能力。所以，我心中的问题是，好吧，你拥有这个伟大的科技生态系统，但它是一个有点存在于泡沫中的生态系统。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um and on the other hand, if you look at the technology ecosystem, it is very impressive and I think is going to you know expand into new sectors and Chinese companies are beun become much more globally important. Uh so I'm quite bullish if you will on China's uh the ability of the top Chinese companies to you know attain leading positions in an increasing number of technology intensive industries right I think that's very very clear and the the the sort of counter forces to that whether it's protectionism or friend shoring or industrial policy elsewhere it's going to be a very very long time uh before those kinds of countermeasures have have impact. But China's got I think very strong um uh capacities there. So the the question I have in my mind is like, okay, you've got this great tech ecosystem, but it's an ecosystem that kind of exists in a bubble

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 而中国经济的其余大部分，也就是人们生活的地方，并没有从这个奇妙的科技生态系统中受益太多。所以对我来说，最大的问题是，你如何让这两者更好地融合？你如何让整个经济从他们正在取得的巨大技术进步中获得更广泛的利益？坦率地说，我真的看不到政府对此有很好的答案。他们基本上似乎对现状感到满意，他们有能力保持事情正常运行，而且我不认为世界其他地方有任何能力使其偏离轨道。中国非常自给自足。所以我不确定这是否是一个看涨的案例，但这将是一个不低估中国企业系统适应性的案例。我想我最后要说的是，即使你看看政治系统，也存在一些适应。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And most of the rest of the Chinese economy where people live doesn't benefit that much from this fantastic tech ecosystem. So to me the big question is how can you get these two things more integrated and how can you have wider benefits through the economy as a whole from this great tech progress that they're making and I don't really frankly see that the government is a great answer that way they they basically seem satisfied with the current the current situation and they have the ability to you know keep keep things on track and I don't I don't think that the rest of the world has really any ability to throw it off track. China is very self-sufficient. Um, so I'm not sure if that's a bull case, but that would be the case for um, uh, you know, not underestimating the adaptability of the Chinese corporate system. And and I guess the final thing I would say is that even if you look at the at the political system, there have been some some adaptations. And so I think

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 我认为**习近平**作为领导人，其特点之一是他比前任领导人更**僵化**。一旦他决定一件事是正确的，他就会坚持很久，即使有证据表明他需要纠正，他比我们之前的三位主要领导人更抗拒纠正。这是一个问题。如果系统存在僵化，这意味着低效率会累积而不是消散。但他确实做了一些纠正。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: One of **she's Xi Jinping's** characteristics as a leader is that he is more rigid than his predecessors. Uh once he decides a thing is correct he sticks with it. Yeah. For a very long time even after the evidence piles up that he needs he's much more resistant to course correction than any of the previous three uh major leaders that we had. Um and that's a problem. If you have a rigidity in the system, that means that inefficiency is built up rather than being dissipated. But but he has made some course corrections.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 而且他已经认识到需要更多的支持。他们正在做一些对家庭更友好的事情。你知道，虽然不是巨大的改变，但，你知道，所以我认为我们可能夸大了系统的僵化程度。它仍然比以前更僵化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um and he has recognized that there needed to be more support. They're doing some things that are a little bit more household friendly. You know, they're not gigantic, but you know, so I I think we can maybe over we can exaggerate how rigid the system is. It's still more rigid than it used to be.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 但再次强调，你的参照点是什么？你的参照点是今天的中国与十年前或十五年前的中国相比吗？还是今天的中国与世界上任何其他国家相比？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: But again, what's your anchor here? Is your anchor what is China today versus the China of 10 or 15 years ago? Or what is China today versus any other country that's out there?

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 如果你选择第一个比较，那就像，是的，今天中国有很多方面不如十年前。有些方面更好，但有些方面更糟，对吧？但如果你将中国与世界上大多数其他国家相比，它仍然表现得相当好。他们调整和调配资源的能力仍然非常出色。只要这种系统性的调整能力保持强大，那么就很难看到中国在短期内（短期意味着未来五年）陷入那种极度停滞或僵化，就像一些批评者所说的那样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Right. If you take the first comparison, it's like uh yeah, there are a lot of things that today that are not as good in China as they were 10 years ago. There's some that are better, but there's some that are worse, right? But if you look at China compared to most other countries in the world, still stacks up pretty well. And their ability to adjust and to push resources where they're needed um is still remarkable. Uh and as long as that systemic adjustment capacity remains strong um then it's hard to see China sliding into the kind of extreme stagnation or sclerosis that you know some of the some of the critics would say in the short run short run meaning the next five years

</details>

**主持人**: 这就是为什么这里有一个看涨的引述，它不像一个坚实的，我想，我不知道你是否读过那篇文章，我记得两年前，也许那是中国股市的底部，基本上我认为一位分析师，我记不清是**摩根大通**还是**高盛**的，他基本上说头条新闻是中国股票不可投资，我认为那标志着市场的低点，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: that's the reason the bull here I have a quote here it's not like a solid I I think like uh I don't know if you read the article I remember like two years ago maybe that's the bottom of the Chinese equity uh basically I think one analyst come out of I can't remember is that **JP Morgan** or **Goldman Sachs** he basically says the headline is that Chinese equity is not investable and I think that marked the low of the the market right

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的，没错。我不是一个市场人士或市场策略师，但是，是的，我的意思是，你在市场中看到的一件事是，人们会采取这些非常极端的立场。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Yes that's right and I'm not a I'm not like a markets guy or market strategist but um yeah I mean one of the things that you see in markets is that people sort of take these very extreme positions.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah, exactly. Right.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 你知道，过去两年情况并非如此。股市表现非常好，你知道，人们已经认识到它不是日本，也不是苏联。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Uh you know and it's just like the last two years that has not been the case. The stock **Morgan** has done very well and you know people have recognized that it's not Japan, it's not the Soviet Union. Um

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 而且你必须以一种更细致入微的方式来看待它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And and you have to take it in a somewhat more nuanced way.

</details>

**主持人**: 我同意。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I I agree.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以这很健康。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: So that's that's healthy.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。我实际上读过一篇文章，实际上是去年年初，我想是前年年底，基本上是说**穆迪**（Moody's）出来争辩说，所有中国的信贷状况以及所有小企业，特别是制造业部门，最糟糕的部分已经过去了，尽管复苏非常缓慢且不确定，但，你知道，基本上不再是那种。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. I actually read an article uh actually um early last year I think end of the year before last year is um basically saying like **Moody's** came out and argue that all the Chinese credit situation and all the small business particular manufacturing sectors the worst part is behind us even though the recovery is super slow and uncertain but like uh it's no longer that in the sho you know like basically that kind of

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，与股市反应相关。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: yeah correlated with the market reaction you know in the in the equity

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 没错。我认为实际上，我大致同意这个评估。说“我们已经触底了，只会向上”总是有点危险。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Right. I think there's actually there's a sort of I would broadly agree with that assessment. It's always a little bit par perilous to say ah we've hit the bottom. It's only up from here.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 但另一个有趣的事情是，如果你看看2019年到2023年间，流向制造业的信贷资金增长了六倍。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um but the other interesting thing is if you look at um uh just credit flows into manufacturing these expanded by a factor of six between 2019 and 2023. Mhm.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以银行对制造业的贷款增加了六倍，这与银行不再向房地产贷款的事实相对应。所以他们停止向房地产贷款，并将所有贷款投入到制造业。所以，你知道，人们有时会问，好吧，为什么中国有这么多**产能过剩**？部分答案是，废话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: So there was a six-fold increase in bank loans to manufacturing which was the counterpart of the fact that the banks were no longer lending to property. So they, you know, they stopped lending to property and they poured all of their lending into manufacturing. And so, you know, people sometimes ask, okay, why do you have so much **excess capacity** in China? And partly the answer is, duh.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 对制造商的贷款增加了六倍。所以对于任何想进入制造业的人来说，钱是免费的。所以当然会有**产能过剩**，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: There was a six-fold increase in lending to manufacturers. So money was free for anyone who wanted to sit on the main franch. So So of course you got **excess capacity**, right?

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 不过有趣的是，这在2023年达到了顶峰。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Now what's interesting though is that peaked in 2023.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Mhm.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 在2024年下降了一半，今天大致保持在这个水平。所以中国正在收紧金融条件，我认为这实际上已经开始对淘汰一些过度竞争产生影响。这需要很长时间，因为地方政府也扮演着角色。但如果银行不再愿意向这些行业投入资金，最终人们就会开始被淘汰，出现一些整合。但这会很慢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Uh and it fell in half in 2024 and it's roughly at that level today. So there is there are tightening financial conditions in um uh in China that I think actually are going to have started to show an impact in winnowing out uh some of this excessive competition. And it takes a long time because the local governments also play a role. But if the banks are no longer willing to pour money into these sectors, eventually people will start to fall by the wayside with some consolidation. But it'll be it'll be slow.

</details>

### 年轻人的“躺平”与科技经济的断裂

**主持人**: 是的。所以我还有一些问题，我实际上为这次播客做了宣传。所以我的有些听众提出了一些问题，我将回答其中一些问题。其中一个问题是，我认为从语境中我可以看出，他可能是一位在中国工作的年轻专业人士，正在经历艰难的就业市场。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. So I also have some uh I actually did a advertisement of this podcast happening. So some of my viewers uh raised some questions and I'm going to go over some of those questions. Uh one of the question is uh I think from the the contest I can tell like he probably is a young professional in China like kind of working that tough uh job market.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的，是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Yeah. Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以他只是说，你知道，目前年轻人都在**躺平**，只是无所事事，欲望很低，所以没有多少消费，可能永远不会结婚或生孩子，你知道，只是过着非常低调的生活。这与你在新闻中看到的中国在高科技领域的激烈竞争形成了非常戏剧性的对比，对吧？所以他的问题是，我们是否真的面临着一种永久性的脱节，即国家变得超级高科技，成为超级大国，但普通公民却被抛在后面，没有出路？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So he's just saying that you know um currently young people are just **laying fat flat** right just like doing nothing and be have a very low desire so you don't have a lot of consumption probably never get married or have kids and you know just like stay a very low profile life um that actually comes into a very dramatic contrast compared to the on the news you see like China's neck competition on the high-tech area right so right um his question is are we really looking at a permanent disconnect where the state become super high tech, you know, the superpower, but the average citizen just left behind with no way up.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的，这是一个很好的问题。你知道，我认为在所有这些事情上，中国是一个大国，有很多不同的事情正在发生，对吧？所以，取决于你选择看哪一部分，你可能会得出完全不同的结论。所以，如果你花时间在深圳，走访所有这些公司，看到所有的人都在努力工作，你会说，是的，这里没有人**躺平**，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Yeah. No, it's it's a great question, you know, and I think on all of these things, you know, China is a big country and there are a lot of different things going on, right? Um, so depending which piece you choose to look at, you can come away with totally, you know, different things. So if you if you spend your time like in Shenzhen going around to all these companies and seeing all the people and how hard they're working say yeah no no one's lying flat here right

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: yeah exactly

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 那么就起来吧。但如果你去其他地方，是的，这显然是一个问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Then get up but then you go elsewhere and yes there are this is clearly clearly an issue um you know I don't have a terrific answer to that other than to kind of repeat what I said earlier which is that there there is clearly there's this disconnect between the vibrant tech economy and large swaths of the rest of the economy.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 我对此没有一个很好的答案，只能重复我之前说过的话，那就是充满活力的科技经济与经济的其余大部分之间显然存在这种脱节。而且，在全国大部分地区，尤其是在就业市场，这些伟大的科技产业并没有带来很多好处。例如，过去十年中国制造业创造的净就业岗位是负数。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um and uh there isn't a lot of benefit in most of the country in most of the job market particularly um from these you know these great tech industries. So for example the net number of jobs that has been created in Chinese manufacturing in the last 10 years is negative.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以，即使中国在所有行业都占据了世界主导地位，今天在制造业工作的人也比十年前少了，对吧？所有新增就业都集中在服务业。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: So even as China's taken over the world in all the sectors, there are fewer people working in manufacturing today than there were 10 years ago, right? Um all new job creation is in the service sector

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 而且，你知道，很多这些工作都非常平淡无奇，而且，你知道，你看不到太多的进步。所以，不，我认为这是一个问题。我认为从社会角度来看，中国的状况真的很艰难。我认为，尤其是在中国30岁以下的人，生活真的很艰难。这可能是这些年来最艰难的时期。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And you know a lot of those jobs are very uninspiring and you know you don't see a lot of you know progress. So no, I think I think that's that's a problem. And I think from a from a social, you know, from a social standpoint, uh I think it's really tough in China. I think particularly if you are under 30 in China, it is really tough. It is probably the toughest toughest it has ever been

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 在我待在那里的所有这些年里，因为即使在90年代，当人们忘记它的时候，情况也相当艰难。当时有很多人在国有企业工作。他们解雇了数千万人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: In all the years that I've been there because even like in the 90s when people forget it was pretty tough. Um there were people working for stateowned enterprises. They laid off tens of millions of them.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 新经济还没有完全起飞。你知道，他们每年必须创造2000万个新工作岗位，才能让每个人都有工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um it was the the new economy hadn't really fully taken off. You know, they had to create 20 million new jobs a year just to keep everyone employed.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 在90年代，做一个年轻人是很艰难的。但至少那时你有一种感觉，事情正在朝着某个方向发展，会变得更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: It was it was it was hard to be a young person back in the 90s. But then at least you had a sense that things were going someplace, getting better.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah,

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 如果你付出努力，就会有回报。而现在我认为，对于越来越多的人来说，他们感觉不到努力会有回报。所以何必费心呢，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: If you put in some effort, it would pay off. And now I think it's it's true that, you know, for an increasing number of people, they don't get the sense that there's a payoff to effort. So why bother, right?

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以，你知道，我对此没有一个很好的答案。我认为，如果你看中国的整体，我认为没有**躺平**的人比**躺平**的人多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: So I, you know, I I think I don't have a great answer to that. I I think, you know, if you look at the totality of China, I think there are more people not lying flat than than are lying flat.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 但再次强调，我认为这是存在的风险之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um but again this is I think one of the risks that's that's out there.

</details>

**主持人**: 我同意。我去年十月实际上在深圳，我拜访的公司在晚上12点开会。我当时想，你们疯了。我要回酒店了。他们说，是的，老板说，是的，我会派我的司机送你，但我会留在这里和我的合伙人开董事会。我当时想，“好吧，太棒了。”他认为他做得很好，所以他显然没有**躺平**。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I agree. I I was actually in uh Shenzhen last uh October and uh the company I visit they are having a meeting at about 12:00 at night. I was like you guys are crazy. I'm going back to hotel. And they were saying yeah the the owner said like yeah I'm going to send you uh with my uh driver but I'm going to stay here and have a board meeting with on my uh partner. I was like, "Okay, great." Like he he thinks he's doing really well, so he's apparently not laying flat. Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的，是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Yeah. Yeah.

</details>

### 中国经济数据的可靠性

**主持人**: 下一个问题我认为很有趣，因为我知道您通过记者和顾问的视角观察中国经济，对吧？您有自己的公司进行分析。然而，有很多批评中国政府数据的人。他们说：“哦，你们的GDP增长与投资数据不符。你们的出口数据与所有贸易伙伴的进口数据相矛盾。你们只是在编造数据。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: The next question I think like it's very interesting because I know you observe um Chinese economies through your lens as a journalist and also as a consultant, right? You have your own firm kind of doing the uh analysis. Uh however, there's a lot of criticize about like the Chinese government data. They say, "Oh, like your your GDP growth doesn't align with the investment figures. Your export data is contradicting all the trading partners importing data. You're just like making the data up."

</details>

**主持人**: 您认为这是一种合理的批评吗？他们将其与苏联相提并论，因为苏联显然通过其政府机构编造了一些数字。您如何应对这种情况？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Um, do you think that that's like a reasonable critic? And uh they compare that to uh Soviet Union because Soviet Union apparently made up some numbers like through their uh government agencies. Uh how do you navigate that that kind of situation?

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 简短的回答是：不。我不认为这是一种有效的批评。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: The short answer is no. I don't think this is a valid critique.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 我认为这是一个很好的例子，说明我们一开始谈论的，即一个伪装成经济论点的政治论点。当人们说“我们不相信数据”时，他们真正想说的是，“嗯，我们不喜欢**中国共产党**。我们不信任它。所以，因此，它说的任何话，包括它的统计数据，我们都不相信。”对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And I think this is a great example of what we were talking about at the at the top, which is a political argument masquerading as an economic one. When people say, "We don't trust the data," what they're really saying is, "Well, we we don't really like the **Communist Party**. We don't trust it. So therefore, anything anything that it says, including its statistics, we we disbelieve." Right.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以我认为，思考这个问题的一种方式是，中国是一个全球一体化的经济体，对吧？他们是世界上最大的出口国。我认为他们仍然是仅次于美国的世界第二大进口国。他们在全球拥有巨大的投资。贸易数据实际上现在在国际收支中有一个技术问题，这是一个争议的焦点，但实际上贸易数据中的差异非常小，而且基本上很容易解释。你知道，所以现实是，贸易数据是你可以验证中国正在发生的事情的一种方式，对吧？是的，你知道，如果经济真的那么小，他们怎么能进口那么多石油呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: So I think the one way to think about this is China is a globally integrated economy, right? They're the biggest exporter in the world. I think they're still number two in imports behind the United States. Um they have huge investments globally. Um the trade data actually there's a technical thing in the balance of payments now which is a big focus of controversy but in fact the discrepancies in the trade data are are pretty minor and uh and and basically pretty easy to explain um and you know so the the reality is that the trade data is one of the ways that you can validate what's going on in China right yeah you know if the economy really so small, how can they import so much oil?

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 例如，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: For example, right?

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 而且有一些你可以物理测量的数据，比如电力输出等等，这些是无法伪造的，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um and there are things that you can measure physically like output of electricity and so forth which just that that that is not fakeable, right?

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以苏联基本上有一个虚构的经济，它在很大程度上是自给自足的，对吧？他们不与世界其他地区贸易。他们只是自给自足。

**Oscar Krberg**: So the Soviet Union basically had a madeup economy which was largely aluric, right? They didn't trade with the rest of the world. They were just within themselves.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 在那种情况下，你可以编造各种数字。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And see in that kind of a situation you can make up all kinds of numbers.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 而且它们可以在一段时间内看起来是真的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Uh and they can seem to be true for a while.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 然后一旦你暴露在世界其他地区，它们就会被揭露为谎言。基本上，这本质上就是，我认为在20世纪60年代和70年代的中国，当它真正是一个封闭的经济体时，情况就是如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And then once you are exposed to the rest of the world, they're revealed as lies. Basically, that's essentially uh and that would have been true, I think, of China in the 60s and 70s. I when they really were a closed off economy,

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 如果中国真的在编造数据，我的经验法则是，在一个开放的系统中，这适用于一个国家编造统计数据，大多数经营公司庞氏骗局的人，比如**安然**（Enron），你大概可以做五年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: It does, you know, if if China were really making things up. Um my rule of thumb is you know in a in an open system and this would apply to a country making up its stat statistics um most people running sort of corporate Ponzi scheme like **Enron** you you can probably do that for about five years.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 在大规模的情况下，你不能超过五年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: At scale and you cannot do it longer for five years.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 如果你只是一个人，有少数几个投资者，你可以做更长时间。但大规模的统计骗局，你只能运行几年。所以如果五年内没有被揭露，没有崩溃，那说明无论存在什么问题，这些数字大体上都在告诉你真相。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: You can do it longer for than five years if you're burning me off and you're just like one guy with you know a handful of investors. Um but at scale you can run a a statistic scam of this type for a few years. So if it hasn't been revealed as you know if it hasn't collapsed in five years what that tells you is whatever the problems are these numbers are broadly you know telling you the the truth.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 而且，你知道，然后你可以进行各种关于GDP数字等等的技术讨论。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um and you know and then you can get into all kinds of technical discussions about the GDP numbers and blah blah blah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 但这是另一种思考方式。你知道，很长一段时间以来，一直有一个小行业的人说，中国过去30年的经济增长率不是10%，而是7%。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um but here's another way of thinking about it. You know, so for a long time there's been cottage industry people saying, well, China's economic growth rate for the last 30 years has not been 10%. It's really been 7%.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 这是我做的所有调整，以证明它是7而不是10。但现实是，因为它是一个开放经济体，你可以非常准确地说，今天的经济规模有多大？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And here are all these adjustments that I do to prove that it's seven, not 10. But the reality is because it's an open economy, you can say with high accuracy, how big is the economy today?

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 嗯。而且你可以看看石油进口数据等等，并进行校准。所以，如果30年来你的经济是X，而过去30年你的经济增长不是10%而是7%。那意味着30年前你的经济规模是你当时认为的两倍。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Mhm. Um and and you can look at the oil import numbers and stuff like that and and you know, calibrate that. And so if for 30 years you your economy is X and for the last 30 years your economy was growing not by 10 but by seven. What that means is that 30 years ago your economy was twice as big.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 你认为这有多大可能？或者反过来说，如果我们认为那个数字是正确的，他们真的增长了7%而不是10%，那么经济规模只有今天看起来的一半。这有多大可能？对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: As you thought it was then. How likely is that? Or conversely if we think that number was correct and they were really growing by seven, not 10, then the economy is only half as big as it appears to be today. And how likely is that? Right?

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 这种练习有一个非常简单的“嗅觉测试”，可以揭示它们。所以不，我拒绝认真对待这一点。这些人大多是对政治系统不满的人，我理解。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: There's like an a very easy smell test that you can do on these kinds of exercises which you know exposes them. So no I don't I just I refuse to take that seriously. These are mostly people who are discontented with the political system, which I understand.

</details>

**主持人**: 我同意。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I agree.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 或者他们夸大了实际存在的数据问题，这些问题确实很严重。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Or or who extrapolate actual real data problems which are significant.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Mhm.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 而且需要大量工作才能理清。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And which require a lot of work to untangle

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 然后说：“哦，好吧，因为我们不能相信这件事。所以，我们不能相信任何事。所以，我们可以编造我们认为现实是什么的数字。”我根本不认为这是一种可信的论证形式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And say, "Oh, well, because we can't believe this thing. Therefore, we can't believe anything. Therefore, we can make up our own numbers about what we think reality is." I just don't find that at all a a a credible form of argumentation.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。我认为这是一个非常好的解释。我同意您的大部分观点。下一个问题实际上是，你知道，自从**习近平**主席上台以来，他无疑加强了对整个社会的控制，对吧？你看到了更多的平民，你看到了更多的大数据控制，而且很多钱都预算花在了真正保持社会稳定上。他们称之为**维稳**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. I I think that's a very good explanation. I agree with you on most points. Um the next question is actually you know uh the since uh President **Xi** came into power he's definitely tightening the control on the whole society right you see more civilians you you see more big data control and like a lot of dollar a lot of money is budget uh spend on like really keep the society stable. They call it like the cost of um **way** like it's in Chinese right

</details>

**主持人**: 这种做法能持续多久？因为你知道，随着经济不景气，这种成本正在增加，人们有自己的看法，他们对当前的政治制度不满，你将花费越来越多的钱来做这件事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: um how sustainable that would be because that cost is kind of increasing as you know the economy is not doing well people have u opinions and they are discontent with the current political system and you're going to spend more and more money on doing that and uh you know

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的，这确实提出了很多有趣的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Yeah that's that that is I think there are a lot of interesting points that are raised by that question. Mhm.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以，一个答案是，在很长一段时间内，中国的党和政府在基本上确保大多数人的生活水平提高方面做得非常好。他们非常擅长将资源从富裕地区推向贫困地区，这样就没有地区被远远落在后面。中国仍然存在很多不平等，它绝不是一个完美的系统，但他们做得还不错。我认为他们基本上向人们推销了一个想法，那就是如果你跟着我们，你会过得很好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: So um one answer is that over a long period of time the party and the government in China have done a very good job of basically making sure that living standards rose for most people with most uh and they did a very good job of pushing resources from rich areas to poor areas so that no area got too far left behind. And there's still a lot of inequality and so forth in China. It's not by any means a perfect system, but they did okay. And I think basically sold people on the idea that um if you stick with us, you will do okay.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 而且，我们只要求你保持政治沉默。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And uh we just ask you to like silence your political views.

</details>

**主持人**: 没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Exactly.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 但我们保证你会没事的。这在很大程度上奏效了。有趣的是，有非常好的调查数据显示，在2010年到2012年左右，当有很多关于中国社会不满的讨论时，实际上人们并没有那么不满。人们说，如果有人致富，那是因为他们聪明勤奋，如果你贫穷，那是因为你懒惰，而且系统没有被操纵。调查数据也非常清楚地显示，人们对当地官员有很多抱怨。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: But we we guarantee that you'll be okay. And that largely worked. Um what's interesting and if there's very good survey data from the like 2010 2012 showing that when there was a lot of discussion about social discontent in China that actually people were not that discontented. Uh people said well if I got if people get rich it's because they're smart and hardworking and if you're poor it's because you're lazy and uh system is not rigged. Um and the the survey data also very clearly showed that that um people have a lot of complaints about their local officials that they see

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 而且他们往往对中央领导层有更高的评价。换句话说，人们普遍没有说这个系统腐败透顶。他们说我的地方官员腐败透顶。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And they tend to have a much higher opinion of the central leadership. So in other words, they're not um in general people are not saying the system is rotten and corrupt. They're saying my local officials are rotten and corrupt. Ah

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 嗯，问题在于此，而不是某种更系统性的问题。现在有趣的是，最近重新进行了一些调查工作，得出了一个更黑暗的结论。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um and that's the issue not some kind of more systemic thing. Now what's interesting is that some of the survey work has been redone recently and it came to a more a darker conclusion

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 也就是说，在**习近平**反腐运动十年之后，人们更有可能说，如果你成功了，那是因为你腐败了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Which is that after 10 years of **Xiinping's** anti-corruption campaigns people are much more likely to say if you're successful it's because you were corrupt 10 years ago.

</details>

**主持人**: 有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Interesting.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 这很有趣。我只能猜测这是为什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: That is interesting. And I I I you can only speculate as to why this is so. Um yeah,

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 我想到两个原因。一个就是，你知道，经济增长速度比以前慢了很多，人们看到的机会更少，如果人们看到的机会更少，他们就更愿意寻找替罪羊。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: I I two ideas come to mind. One is just like you know the economy is growing a lot slower than it was and people see less opportunity and if people see less opportunity then they're more look more willing to look for scapegoats.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以我认为这可能是其中一部分。另一个可能的原因是，因为**习近平**花了这么多时间大肆宣扬腐败，人们只是更内化了一种感觉，哦，哇，我没有意识到这个系统是那么腐败。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um so I think that's part of it. Uh the other possible part of it is because **Xinping** has spent so much time trumpeting corruption that people have been just internalized more of a sense about oh wow I didn't realize that the system was that

</details>

**主持人**: 那么腐败。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: so corrupt. Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以，从这个意义上说，反腐有点适得其反。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um so it kind of the anti-corruption in that sense sort of backfired.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以，是的，如果你看看他们在国内安全等方面的支出，那是非常巨大的。所以那是一个成本。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um so yeah and and if you look at what they spend on domestic security and so forth it is it is massive. Mhm. And so that is a cost.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 我不认为它现在是致命的，有几个原因。首先，对于中国大多数城市的大多数人来说，生活相当不错，你的物质条件得到了合理的照顾，并且有一种普遍的安全感和稳定感。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: I don't think it's crippling yet for a couple reasons. One is again for most people in most of urban China, life is pretty good and your material circumstances are reasonably well taken care of and there's a sense of security and stability that is, you know, broadly shared.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 嗯，你知道，这种情况可能会改变，但目前，我认为这是大多数人的体验。所以人们对系统有一定的容忍度，因为，你知道，事情还不错。而且，你知道，另一件事是，我讨厌把事情归咎于娱乐文化，但是，现实是，中国拥有非常丰富的娱乐文化，而且成本合理。是的。你知道，人们谈论，哦，有**防火墙**，你无法访问外国网站，但中国没有人关心这个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um, you know, and that could change, but right right now, I think that's most people's experience. So there's a a degree of tolerance that people give to the system because you know things are kind of okay. Um and um and you know then the other thing is like the I hate to blame things on sort of entertainment culture but um the reality is China has a very rich entertainment culture that is cost right. Yeah. And you know, and people talk about, oh, there's the **great firewall** and you can't get foreign websites and no one in China cares about that.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 他们拥有一个巨大的国内互联网，他们可以整天在上面玩。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: They have a tremendous domestic internet that they can, you know, play on all day.

</details>

**主持人**: 哦，是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Oh, yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 有巨大的游戏、短视频、整个生态系统、社交媒体，非常活跃。所以，人们可以在这个意义上过着相当积极的生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: There's uh huge, you know, sort of gaming, short video, whole ecosystem, social media, very vibrant. So, people can live pretty active lives in that sense.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 除非他们卷入非常针对性的政治问题，否则他们不会受到超级限制。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Where they're not super constrained unless they get into, you know, very targeted political.

</details>

**主持人**: 我同意。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I agree. Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以我倾向于认为所有这些事情都意味着，你看，这不是我选择生活的系统。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um so I I tend to think that all of these things mean that um look, this is not the system that I would choose to live under.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 而且我认为它太受限制了等等，但我认为这是一个继续运作得足够好的系统，对政权来说成本可接受。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um and I think it's too constraining and and and whatnot, but I I think it is a system that that continues to work well enough at acceptable cost for the regime.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 你可以用各种方式批评它，但我认为它在未来几年内不太可能崩溃或造成某种无法承受的成本。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And you can critique it in any number of ways, but I don't think that it's likely to fall apart or or create some kind of unbearable cost in the next several years.

</details>

### 隐性福利与全球南方战略

**主持人**: 是的。下一个问题非常有趣。我认为基本上听众是在试图反驳**许成钢教授**或**秦晖教授**的所有悲观情绪。他基本上说，你知道，中国的生活成本如此之低。我们有非常便宜的公用事业，非常好的交通，成本非常低。教育非常便宜。就像我，我在中国接受了高中和大学教育，费用并不高。对我的父母来说，这不是一个沉重的负担来支持我们完成学业。美国完全是另一个故事。我认为在所有西方发达国家，那些私立学校都非常昂贵。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. The next uh next question is very interesting. I think um basically the listener is arguing like trying to push back against all the pessimism from uh **professor Shu** or uh **Chinuay**. Uh he basically said that you know uh China has such a low cost of living. You have we have like really cheap utilities uh great transportation really low cost. Education is really cheap. Like I I did my um high school like college education in China and the cost is not that great. It's not a heavy burden for my parents like to kind of support us through that. US is completely different story. I think in all the western developed countries those private schools are super expensive.

</details>

**主持人**: 但他们认为这是一种**隐性福利**，是中国人民正在享受的，与美国等富裕国家相比，这不是直接的现金发放，而是一种你得到的福利。这就是为什么很多中国人仍然对自己的现状感到满意的原因，尽管他们可能没有达到最幸福的状态，但他们仍然生活得很舒适。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: But like they argue that that's kind of the **hidden welfare** the Chinese people are enjoying comparing to those wealthy nation like US which is not direct cash handle but it's like you know it's it's benefit you kind of get. So that's the reason that a lot of people in China are still happy with where they are, even though not as happy as they could be, but like they're still comfortable living there.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的，我认为这是真的。我之前在谈论社会福利系统时也提到了这一点。从正式的角度来看，如果你衡量他们在养老金和社会保险等方面的支出，那并不是很好。但如果你看看你可以称之为**隐性社会福利系统**，它有很多组成部分，而这种**低生活成本**就是其中之一。我认为，如果你看看**习近平**过去几年的言论，当人们谈论通货紧缩等等时，我认为很清楚他就是这样看待的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Yeah, I think that's true. Um I I kind of made that point earlier when I was talking about the, you know, the social welfare system. Um that in formal terms, if you measure what do they pay out in pensions and social insurance and so forth, it's it's not that great. But if you look at the kind of what you could call the **implicit social welfare system**, there are a lot of elements into it and and this sort of **low cost of living** is one and I think you know if you if you look at **Xiinping's** rhetoric over the last several years when people talk about you know deflation and so forth I think it's pretty clear that this is how he he views

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 那就是，哦，通货紧缩有什么问题？这意味着物价更低，每个人都过得更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Uh that oh what's wrong with deflation? It means lower prices everyone is better off.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以我认为，是的，你知道，美国目前最大的政治问题是什么？是**可负担性**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um and and so forth. So I think there is there is some you know and it is it is true that you know you look at the United States what's the big political issue at the moment it's **affordability**.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. Exactly.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 对吧？因为住房成本太高，还有所有其他成本也太高，这是一个真正的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Right. Because housing costs too much and there are all these other costs that are too much and it's a real problem.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 我认为另一方面是，是的，中国能够实现这种公民容忍度的方式之一是，生活就是这样，你可以用不多的钱过上不错的生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Uh and I think the the sort of the flip side of that is um yes that China has um uh one of the ways that they are able to engineer this sort of tolerance uh among citizenry is that life just you can live an okay life for that not that much money. Mhm.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 这在某种程度上降低了你对现在需要赚多少钱或未来需要赚多少钱才能过得好的期望。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And so that kind of reduces your expectations of how much money you need to make now or how much you need to make in future in order to be okay.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 嗯。所以我想这是他们创造的**同意机制**的一部分。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Mhm. So I think I think that is part of the if you will **consent mechanism** they've created.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么下一个问题是关于**全球南方战略**的。他说，哦，是的，我们中国公司有这种**产能过剩**，与其与所有敌对的西方市场作斗争，我们能不能简单地转向投资**全球南方**，比如与非洲合作，与亚洲其他国家合作，创造新的需求？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So uh next question he asked about is uh kind of from the the **global south strategy**. So he say like oh yeah we China company has this overap capacity instead of fighting with all the hostile western markets can we just simply pivot to invest in the **global south** like working with um Africa working with like uh Asian other Asian countries and to create new demand.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的，既是也不是。我的意思是，我认为现实是，你知道，美国和欧洲这些富裕国家仍然是最好的市场。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Yeah. Uh yes and no. Uh I mean I think the reality is um that you know the US and Europe the rich countries are still the best markets.

</details>

**主持人**: 没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Exactly.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 如果你和**比亚迪**（BYD）或**宁德时代**（CATL）等任何一家大型中国科技公司交谈，他们都渴望进入美国市场。他们会非常喜欢那样，因为那是巨大的市场。你可以收取更高的价格。所以，是的，你可以通过多元化进入低收入市场来维持生计，但这显然是一个次优策略。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: If you if you if you talk to any of these big Chinese tech companies like **BYD** or **Cat** Yeah. they are desperate to get it to the US market. They would love that so much because they're huge markets. You can you can charge higher prices. Um so yeah you can get by you know diversifying into lower income markets but that is clearly a suboptimal strategy.

</details>

**主持人**: 我同意。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I agree

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 对于大多数这些国家公司来说。所以，你知道，从中国企业的角度来看，更理想的情况是他们能够达成某种安排，从而获得更多的市场准入。让我们现实一点。我的意思是，如果你把世界分为**经合组织**（OECD），即经济合作与发展组织国家，这基本上是大约30个富裕民主国家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: For most of these countries companies. So um you know the the more ideal situation from Chinese corporate perspective is that they could work out some arrangement whereby um uh you know they could gain more access and and let's be real about this. This. I mean, if you divide the world into the **OECD**, the Organization of Economic Partition Development Countries, this is about 30 rich democracies basically.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 它们仍然占全球经济的60%以上。这比30年前有所下降，但仍然是全球经济的三分之二。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: They still account for 60 plus% of the global economy. And that's down from what it was 30 years ago, but that's still twothirds of the global economy.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 嗯，而且这个份额正在下降，但下降速度非常缓慢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um, and that shares is falling, but it's falling very slowly.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以我认为中国采取一种“全球战略”更为理性，如果完全被美国和欧洲市场拒之门外，你就能完全扭转局面，这种想法有点一厢情愿。现在现实是，你并没有完全被美国和欧洲市场拒之门外，尤其是在欧洲。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: So I I think it is much more rational for China to have a sort of all the world strategy on this and it it's a little bit uh wishful thinking to think that if you are completely shut out of the markets of of the US and Europe that you can totally make this upside now the reality is that you're not totally shut out of of US and European markets particularly in Europe.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 但即使在美国，你知道，中国公司不能卖汽车，但消费电子产品他们卖了很多。哦，是的，我同意。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: But even in the US you know the Chinese companies can't sell cars but consumer electronics they're selling a ton. Oh yeah, I agree. Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以现实是，中国无论直接还是间接，都继续严重依赖美国和其他发达市场，这种情况在未来一段时间内仍将如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Uh so the reality is that China continues both directly and indirectly to be heavily heavily reliant on the US and the other developed markets and that's going to be the case for some time to time.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

### 强国定义与新加坡模式

**主持人**: 那么听众的下一个问题是，他问了一个关于**强国**的哲学问题，对吧？所以我想我们都可以同意，中国作为一个国家力量，是第二位，或者说，我的意思是，**特朗普**总统正在谈论G2，对吧？我认为他是一个非常务实和现实的地缘政治领域的人。所以我不会反驳这一点。但就个体普通公民的生活水平而言，中国仍然远远落后于所有领先的西方国家，对吧？所以他的问题是，美国和中国是否对**强国**的构成有根本不同的定义？比如美国真正关注个体，而中国是，“我们只看大国，我们强大，就这样，我们真的不需要推动个体进步。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So the next question from the listener is uh he he he's asking about like a philosophical question about the **strong nation**, right? So I think we we can all agree like China as a state power is like number two or like I mean like President **Trump** is talking about G2, right? I think he's he's a very pragmatic and re realist u the geopolitics um area. So I I wouldn't argue against that. But like from the individual average citizen living standard, China is still uh pretty much behind of all the leading western countries, right? So um his question is like does US and China simply have fundamentally different definition of what constitute a **strong nation**? Like US is really focused on individual but China is like we we are just looking at the grand country we're strong that's it we don't really need to push for that uh individual improvement.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 嗯，是的，我认为这在某种程度上是一个公平的观点。你知道，现在可能比一年前不那么真实了。我的意思是，现在有了**特朗普**，美国政府的立场似乎很清楚，我们真的不太关心个人福利，也不太关心这些国家权力的象征。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um yeah I think that's to some degree a fair point. You know it's maybe less true than it was a year ago. I mean with **Trump** now um it seems pretty clear the position of the US government is that we really don't care that much about individual welfare and about these kind of tokens of state state power.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。我认为有一个有趣的笑话，大家都期望中国表现得更像美国，但现在美国却表现得更像中国。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. I think like the funny there's a funny joke uh everybody expect China to behave more like US but now US is behaving more like China.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的，没错。他们有点像中国的拙劣模仿者，吸取了所有最糟糕的方面，却没有好的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Yes, that's right. They're kind of a bad copy of China taking all the worst aspects and none of the good stuff. Mhm.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以，是的，我认为这揭示了，好吧，美国一直有这种个人主义的意识形态等等，而且经济至少自二战以来一直以一种非常偏向消费者福利的方式运行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um so yeah and I think what that reveals is that okay so the US has always had sort of this ideology of you know individualism and and so forth and and and the economy has been run you know at least since World War II uh with a pretty strong bias in favor of consumer welfare. Mhm.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 嗯。但是，你知道，美国也长期以来是一个全球大国。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um but you know the US has also been a a big global power for a long time.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 嗯，你知道，相当帝国主义。而且帝国主义以不同的形式出现。现在它基本上是赤裸裸的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Uh you know pretty imperialist. Um and the imperialism takes you know different guises. Right now it's basically naked. Um

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 但是，你知道，即使它不那么赤裸，它也仍然存在，对吧？所以，我认为美国领导层长期以来一直非常认真地对待，你知道，如何促进中国人所说的**综合国力**的概念。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Uh but you know even when it wasn't naked it was still there right? So um I think the US leadership has has for a very long time taken quite seriously you know concepts of what you need to do to um promote what the Chinese would call **comprehensive national power**.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 我想，如果我必须分析的话，我会说，你看，如果你看看冷战时期，美国和苏联之间存在明显的竞争。20世纪50年代和60年代，美国有很多国家项目，特别是那些由大国竞争意识驱动的项目，我们作为一个国家必须做一些事情，这些事情与消费者福利无关，但对国家权力很重要，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um and I think I guess if I had to analyze I would say look if you look in the cold war there was a clear sort of US versus Soviet Union rivalry. Um there were a lot of national projects in the United States in the 50s and 60s particularly which were driven by this sense of great power competition and there were things that we had to do as a nation that didn't have anything to do with consumer welfare but were important for for national you know power right

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 你知道，我认为在冷战结束时，基本上从90年代开始，美国说，好吧，我们不必再那样做了，因为我们是唯一剩下的超级大国，所以我们不需要这些国家项目。我们只需要，你知道，做个体财富最大化，基本上就这样，这很好。然后你把所有这些加起来，我们很棒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: You know and I think at the end of the cold war basically from the 90s onwards the US said well we don't really have to do that anymore because we're the sole remaining superpower and so we don't need these national projects. We can just, you know, do m individualized wealth maximization basically and that's fine. And then you add all that up and we're great.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 在某种意义上他们确实如此。我的意思是，如果你看看美国经济自2008年金融危机以来的表现，它是世界上所有国家中最好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um and in some sense they were I mean if you look at the US economic performance since the financial crisis of 2008 it is the best of any country in the world.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 基本上比任何发达国家都好。而且，你知道，过去五年，正如我所说，它的增长速度实际上比中国快。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Basically better than any developed country. And you know for the last five years as I said it's actually been growing faster terms than China. So yeah,

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以，是的，它确实有其运作方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: There is a way in which that works. Um um

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 但是，你知道，你会说美国完全是为了让个人生活尽可能好而运行的吗？嗯，美国很多人会对此提出异议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: But it's also, you know, would you say that the US has been run totally with an idea to making the individual's life as good as it possibly can be? Well, a lot of people in the US would dispute that.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 你知道，所有这些关于可负担性的问题。嗯，你知道，政治系统中正在出现巨大的社会裂痕。这个国家有很多人觉得他们受到了不公平的待遇。所以情况很复杂，对吧？在美国也很复杂。我认为不同之处在于，中国拥有一个更统一的政治系统。它是威权主义的。所以高层会有一个权威性的观点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: You know, all these questions about in affordability. Uh you know, there's huge social fractures that are showing up in the the political system. There are a lot of people in the in the country who feel that they've gotten a raw deal. Um so it's mixed, right? It's mixed in the US. Um and I I think the difference is that that China has a kind of a more unified political system. It is authoritarian. So there is kind of an authoritative view that comes out at the top.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 嗯，你知道，它基本上是一个列宁主义的政治结构，高度中央集权。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Uh it is, you know, basically a Leninist political structures are highly centralized.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 而且，你知道，是的，确实有这种国家权力的愿景，它被清晰地表达出来，与大多数消费者福利的概念是脱节的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um and um and so you know yes there is this kind of vision of national power um that gets articulated which is divorced from most concepts of like consumer welfare

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 但我会说它也是平衡的，对吧？所以我认为中国之所以能长期如此成功，是因为他们以这种整体方式追求国家权力，但他们也认识到，为了使其可持续，中国大多数人必须从中获得足够的好处，才能继续参与游戏。所以一直有这种观念，即中国必须有广泛的共享繁荣和增长，并下沉到家庭层面。所以，列宁主义的综合国力愿望，我认为在过去几十年里一直被这种认识所抑制，即如果我们像苏联那样做，我们就会像苏联那样结束。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: But I I would say it's it's also balance right so I think the reason that China has been so successful for so long is like they've been pursuing national power in this overall way but they've recognized for in order for that to be sustainable most people in China have to get enough out of it for them to keep playing the game. So there has been this sense that there has to be broad shared prosperity and growth in China that that goes down to the to the household level. Um so the the kind of Leninist um comprehensive national power uh aspiration has always been I think tempered over the last few decades by this knowledge that if we do it the way the Soviet Union did, we will end up the way the Soviet Union did.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 而苏联所做的，是没有足够关注普通公民的生活质量，以及经济机会。我认为这个教训仍然深深地根植于中国领导层，无论他们现在多么关注这些大国竞争问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: And what the Soviet Union did is that it did not pay enough attention to the quality of life for the average citizen. Um and to sort of economic opportunity and I think that lesson is still very very uh deeply entrenched in the Chinese leadership however much they've become more focused on these great power competition issues.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。您认为中国能转型为新加坡那样的模式吗？您知道，从我们美国人的角度来看，新加坡并不是一个真正的民主国家，对吧？它有一个非常强大的执政党，而且它有一个不错的社会福利计划，它也严厉打击那些持不同政见或批评政府的人，但尽管如此，政府在改善福利方面声誉很好，而且他们有一个非常好的司法系统，我认为他们称之为法治，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. Do you think China can transition into a model that Singapore has done? You know like Singapore is not really we we from our American terms it's not really a democratic country right like it has a very strong party kind of ruling and uh it has it has a decent social uh welfare program it also uh pretty cracking down on people have descent or criticize the government but even though like the government has a pretty good reputation of improving the welfare like but they have a very good judicial system I think like they call it far, right? Like they basically rule by law, right?

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 我认为法治比民主更重要，就像仅仅投票，每个人都有一票，通常你会遇到多数人暴政，或者有其他术语来形容，我不认为那是一个理想的系统。你会看到更多民粹主义政府从中产生。我认为中国有潜力转型为新加坡模式，变得更加审慎，专注于法治，而不是让你陷入民粹主义民主。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Uh I I would argue I think rule by law is more important than democracy like just like voting everybody has a one vote like typically you will have uh majority uh tyranny or like there's other terms talking about that like I don't think that's ideal system. You will have more uh populist government coming out of that. I think like do you think China has a potential to kind of transition to the Singapore model be more judicious like rule by law focus on that instead of like you know getting you into a populist uh democracy.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的。对此我有几个回应。首先，作为一名美国人，我不同意你最后一点。我认为民主是一件非常好的事情。它不能保证良好的治理。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Yeah. Well I have a I have a couple response to that. So first of all as a you know American I will disagree with you on that last point. I I think democracy is a very good thing. It doesn't guarantee good governance.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 但我认为它比大多数其他制度更有可能长期维持良好的治理。另一件事是，我认为人们对**法治**这个概念有点过于执着。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um, but it gives you, I think, a better shot at sustaining good governance over a long period of time. I agree, most other systems. And the other thing is that I think people get a little bit too hung up on the on the on the sort of rule rule by law, **rule of law** thing.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 毫无疑问，我认为美国作为一个国家有点过度律师化了。所以我们可以少一点那样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Uh there's no question in my mind that the US as a dance is a little bit over lawyered. So we can do with a little less of that. Um

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 但是，你知道，它真正归结为的是，你是否能维持良好的治理，对吧？而且，你知道，拥有一个良好的法律系统，对权力进行各种制约，我认为这对于做到这一点非常重要，而且在任何非民主系统中都很难实现。所以我仍然会，你知道，我个人会说，从长远来看，在一个先进经济体中，你知道，民主比其他系统更好。我的意思是，**习近平**去世后会发生什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Uh but also you know what what it really boils down to is can you can you sustain good governance right and um you know having a good legal system with various kinds of checks on on power I think it's really important to do that and it's very it's very difficult to achieve that in any kind of non-democratic system. So I would still, you know, personally I would just say um over the long run um uh in an advanced economy um you know you're you're better off with democracy than with some other system. I mean what happens when **Xiinping** dies, right?

</details>

**主持人**: 我们不知道会发生什么。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: We we have no idea what is going to happen. Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 之后中国政治系统会发生什么。你可以想象许多许多不同的结果，对吧？所以很明显，我的意思是，很明显民主让美国有很多问题，我们现在正全面看到它们。所以我不想粉饰太平。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: To the the Chinese political system after that. And you can imagine many many different outcomes, right? So clearly I mean clearly democracy allow the US has a lot of problems and we are seeing them full full on right now. So I don't want to sugarcoat it

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 但它就像，平均而言，从长远来看，你更愿意选择哪种？我认为那。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: But just it's like on average over time which would you'd rather have I think that's that

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 嗯，我仍然会选择那个。但话虽如此，我认为威权系统也有广泛的范围。有些非常有效，能在很长一段时间内提供良好的治理。中国就是一个很好的例子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um I I would still go for that in terms of but that said you know I think authoritarian systems also have a wide range. Some are very effective do provide good governance over a long period of time. China is a good example of that. Mhm.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 嗯，我认为新加坡，你说得对，是那种非民主威权系统提供非常一致、受约束的良好治理的终极例子，而且持续了很长时间。所以他们有一个成功的模式。我将以一个杜撰的轶事来结束，它能说明我对中国是否能像新加坡一样发展的看法。我不知道是否还记得是谁告诉我这个故事的，我敢肯定它不是真的，但它太好了，不能不用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: Um, and I think Singapore, you're right, is is sort of the ultimate example of a non-democratic authoritarian system that has provided very consistent constrained good governance for a very very long time. So they they have a successful model. Um, I will I will end with a apocryphal anecdote that gives gives you my view on on whether they China could become like Singapore. I don't know if remember who told me the story and I'm sure it's not true but it's yeah it's too good not to use.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 故事是这样的：20世纪80年代，新加坡总理**李光耀**来到北京，与**邓小平**会面。**李光耀**像往常一样滔滔不绝地谈论自己有多伟大，新加坡现在如何，中国应该怎么做，中国应该怎么做。**邓小平**只是非常安静地坐着，时不时地向他的痰盂吐痰。然后，在**李光耀**坐下并筋疲力尽之后，**邓小平**向前倾身说：“李先生，这很有趣。如果我能成为这个城市的市长，我一定会听从你的建议。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: So the story is that **Lee Guuan Yu** the prime minister of Singapore back in the 80s came up to Beijing and had a meeting with **Doug Jing**. Uhhuh. And **Lieuan Yu** as was his want like talked endlessly about how great he was and how Singapore was now, how China should do this and China should do that. And **Dung** just sort of sat there very quietly every so often would spit into his spatoon. And then finally after **Lee Kuanu** had sat down and you know exhausted himself **dung** le forward and said Mr. Lee that was very interesting and should I ever become the mayor of the city I will be sure to follow your advice.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 重点是，你在新加坡能做的事情，因为它是一个城邦，基本上与在一个完整规模的国家，更不用说像中国这样人口、地理和社会复杂性都巨大的国家所能实现的事情毫无关系。所以，不，我认为中国不可能选择“干净的新加坡选项”。它总是会是一个更加复杂和分裂的治理挑战。如果你看看今天中国的现实，我认为这仍然是事实。**习近平**仍然拥有比前任领导人更大的权力。它非常中央集权，但地方层面仍然发生着很多事情，中央政府无法完全控制。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: So the point of it being what you can do in Singapore because it is a city state has basically nothing to do with what is achievable on a full-scale country let alone a full-scale country on the scale of China which is just gigantic both in terms of population geography social complexity etc. So no that I think a sort of a a clean Singapore option is not available for China. It is always going to be a way more complicated and fractious um uh you know governance challenge. And if you look at the reality of China today I think that's still true. He's still you know **Xinping** has a lot more authority than past leaders. It's very centralized, but there's still a lot going on at the local level that the center is not really able to control all that well.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 所以，无论中国政治演变会是什么样子，它都将是它自己的东西。我认为它既不会与新加坡模式非常接近，也不会与美国模式非常接近。它必须找到其他道路。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Oscar Krberg**: So, whatever China's political evolution is going to be, it's going to be its own thing. It's not going to be, I think, all that close either to the Singapore model on the one hand or the US model on the other hand. Got to figure some other some other path.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，我认为我真的很喜欢您的故事。我记得读过一篇文章，基本上学者认为民主是一种奢侈品，当你的平均GDP达到一定水平，高于那个水平时，更容易保持民主，否则你就会看到民主变成，你知道，威权政权，人们很容易劫持系统，改变一堆规则，改变宪法，现在你看到很多民主国家或以前被视为民主的国家都发生了这种情况，例如委内瑞拉就是一个例子，它曾经有一个非常，怎么说，广泛参与的民主系统，但当**查韦斯**赢得选举时，他只是改变了宪法，他基本上是缓慢而肯定地摧毁了那个系统。我非常感谢您的时间，今天的谈话真的很好。我非常感谢您的时间和参与，希望您在未来的事业中一切顺利。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah, I I think I really like your story and I I remember reading a article basically the scholar argued that democracy is a luxury like when you average GDP reach a certain level above that level it's easier for it's more likely you're going to keep that democracy otherwise you're going to see that democracy kind of turned into you know um authoritarian regime and it's very easy for people to hack hijack the system and change a bunch of the rules and uh change the constitution and now you're seeing that happens in a lot of democratic country or formerly viewed as democratic country right for example Venezuela is one example like it used to have a very um how to say broad like participated democratic system but when **Chavis** win the election and he just like changed the constitution and he he basically slowly but surely destroyed the the system. Uh I really appreciate your time and uh today's conversation is really good. I I really appreciate your time and participation and hope you uh doing well in your future endeavors.

</details>

**Oscar Krberg**: 是的。非常感谢。我认为这是一次很棒的对话。结构非常好。我喜欢所有的问题，也很高兴能够间接地与**秦晖**和**许成钢**交流。你知道，那里有很多非常有趣的内容。

**Oscar Krberg**: Yeah. Well, thank you very much. I thought it was a great conversation. Uh very well structured. I I enjoyed uh all the questions and I enjoyed being able to uh engage even vicariously with **Chinhai** and **Shujang**. You know, a lot of very interesting food there.
