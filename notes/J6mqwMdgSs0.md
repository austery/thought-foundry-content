### 政治中的人质效应

**主持人**: J. Paul Nadeau 是一位退休的警探和人质谈判专家，他现在来到演播室。你好，Paul？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jan**: J. Paul Nadeau is a retired
police detective and hostage
negotiator, and he joins me in
studio.
How are you doing, Paul?
</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 我很好。Jan，你呢？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> I'm doing well.
Jan, how are you doing?
</details>

**主持人**: 我很好。那么，我们来谈谈这件事。我们知道许多政客和媒体在描述与唐纳德·特朗普的谈判时，都使用了“被劫持为人质”这个词。这仅仅是夸张的说法，还是你会说，这是一种准确的描述？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> I'm doing well.
Well, let's let's talk about it.
We know that numerous
politicians and media have used
the term taken hostage in
describing their negotiations
with Donald Trump.
Is that just hyperbole, or is
that, would you say, an accurate
description?
</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 这确实是一种准确的描述。这不仅仅是与特朗普打交道，而是当今世界的状态，民主的不确定性以及各种政策的出台，都让人们感到非常、非常焦虑，感觉自己像是人质。当人们想到人质时，他们会想到被关在笼子里的人，想到被武力劫持的人。但实际上，当我们审视世界现状时，即使我们周围没有笼子，我们仍然可能被当作人质，因为掌权者可以让我们感到不稳定、担忧、不安。所以，是的，这是对正在发生的事情的一种非常准确的描述。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> That would be an accurate
description.
Not only is it just dealing with
Trump, the state of the world
right now with the uncertainties
in democracy and in different
policies that are coming out,
are making people feel very,
very anxious and a hostage to
me.
When people think about
hostages, they think about
people in cages, they think
about people who have been taken
by force.
But really, when we take a look
at the state of the world, we
can still be taken hostage, even
though there are no cages around
us, because the people in
control can make us feel
unstable, worried, concerned.
So yes, that's a very accurate
description of what's happening.
</details>

### 历史上的相似人物

**主持人**: 在世界舞台上，我们以前见过像唐纳德·特朗普这样的人吗？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Have we seen anyone like
Donald Trump before?
Sort of on the world stage
before?
</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 哦，我们见过。是的。纵观历史，我们见过不同的人。我不会将唐纳德·特朗普与希特勒相提并论，但看看当年德国的独裁统治，那些不同的做法，被剥夺的权利。但纵观历史，我们确实有过那些真正将自己置于首位的领导人。其结果是，世界上充满了愤怒和不确定性。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Oh, we have.
Yes.
Throughout history we have seen
different people.
I'm not going to compare Donald
Trump to Hitler, but take a look
at what happened back then in
Germany with the dictatorships,
the the different approaches,
the rights that were taken away.
But throughout history, we have
had leaders who have really put
themselves first.
And consequently there's been
there's been a lot of of anger
and a lot of uncertainty in the
world.
</details>

### 《人质效应》的创作缘由

**主持人**: 好的。在你的书《人质效应》（The Hostage Effect）中，你谈到唐纳德·特朗普的再次当选是你决定写这本书的催化剂。请帮我理解一下。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> All right.
In your book, The Hostage
Effect, you speak about the
re-election of Donald Trump as
being sort of the catalyst for
for why you decided to write
this book.
Help me understand that.
</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 当唐纳德·特朗普当选时，我开始觉得自己也像个人质。心想：接下来会发生什么？他谈论要接管加拿大，接管格陵兰，各种信息和不确定性层出不穷。我当时想，接下来会发生什么？每天都有新的公告，我感到焦虑。一位我认识的熟人联系我说：“你也这么觉得吗？” 我说：“是的。” 她说：“如果说有什么时候适合你谈论世界感觉像人质，那就是现在了。” 我想了想，觉得她说得对。我们确实感觉像人质，我们被俘虏了。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> When Donald Trump was
elected, I started to feel like
a hostage myself.
Like, what's going to happen
next?
He was talking about taking over
Canada, taking over Greenland,
all kinds of information was
coming out and uncertainty.
And I felt, well, what's going
to happen next?
Every day there was a new
announcement and I felt anxious,
and someone I know quite well
reached out to me and says, are
you feeling this, too?
And I said, yeah.
She says, if there was ever a
time for you to talk about how
the world is feeling like a
hostage, it's now.
And I thought about that and I
thought, you're right.
We are feeling like hostages.
We're being taken captive.
</details>

### 成为人质的早期迹象

**主持人**: 你的书里显然有很多故事，我想了解一下谈判专家的思维模式。你写到的，一个人在困境中成为人质的早期迹象有哪些？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> There are obviously a number
of stories in your book that you
talk about, and I want to get
sort of into the headspace of a
negotiator.
What are some of the early signs
that a person is becoming a
hostage in their situation, that
you write about.
</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 当他们感觉自己的声音被压制时，当他们觉得随时可能危及自身安全、保障、工作不保时。当一个人感到自己被 immobilised（动弹不得），因为害怕我们的领导人会做什么、说什么或夺走什么而无法前进时。这就是一种人质状态。当我谈到“人质效应”时，它几乎就像一种病毒，一种条件反射。“你必须听我的，事情就会这样发生。” 这就是人们的感受。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> When they feel that their
voices are being silenced, when
they feel that at any time their
safety can be jeopardised, their
security can be jeopardised,
their jobs can be gone.
When a person feels that they
are immobilised and unable to
move forward from the fear of
what our leaders will do or say
or take away from us.
That is a state of hostage.
When I talk about the hostage
effect, it's almost like a
virus.
It's a conditioning.
You will listen to me and this
is what's going to happen.
So that's how people are
feeling.
</details>

### 危机谈判的思维模式

**主持人**: 在准备进入一次危机谈判时，什么样的心态是最好的？我们不一定谈论政治家，而是作为你本人，一位谈判专家。当你进入一个情境时，你是什么样的心态？或者也许你有一个想分享的故事？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> The what sort of mindset is
best when preparing to enter a
crisis negotiation?
We won't talk necessarily as
politicians in this case, but as
a negotiator yourself.
What does that mindset when
you're entering into a
situation?
Or perhaps there is a story that
you would like to share.
</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 当我准备谈判时，我会尽我所能去了解我要谈判的对象。我们有什么情报？我从人质谈判专家的角度出发。我们对这个人了解多少？情况如何？面前有哪些障碍？我将如何着手？嗯，我首先要做的是，我将首先寻求理解，然后才被理解，因为人们希望被倾听，希望被看见，希望被感受。所以，当你与某人在冲突中，甚至在政治局势中进行谈判时，你的方法必须是友善的、开放的，并且要是一个探究者——我们如何一起努力克服这个困难的局面？我们双方想要什么？我们如何解决这个问题？这就是人质谈判专家的心态。我理解你正在经历很多。嘿，Jeyan，我理解。我来帮忙。如果你有人质，我会这样接近你。我会说：“告诉我发生了什么，这样我才能更好地理解我到底能如何帮助你达到你想要达到的目标。”
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> When I'm preparing for a
negotiation, I am trying to find
out as much as I possibly can
about the person I'm about to
negotiate with.
What intelligence do we have?
I'm going from a hostage
negotiators standpoint.
What do we know about this
person?
What are the circumstances?
What are the barriers in front
of it?
How am I going to approach?
Well, the first thing I'm going
to do is I'm going to seek first
to understand and then to be
understood, because people want
to be heard, they want to be
seen, they want to be felt.
So when you're negotiating with
someone in a conflict or even in
a political situation, your
approach has to be amicable, has
to be open, and has to be
someone who's inquiring, what is
it that we can do together to
work throughout this difficult
situation that we're both, you
know, what is it that we both
want and how can we resolve
this?
And that's the mindset of a
hostage negotiator.
I understand you're going
through a lot.
Hey, Jeyan, I understand.
I'm here to help.
That's how I would approach you.
If you had a hostage.
And I would say, tell me what's
going on so that I have a better
understanding of where I can
actually help you to reach what
it is that you're trying to
reach.
</details>

### 真实的谈判案例

**主持人**: 当我们说“人质”、“人质谈判”时，我想我们倾向于想到电影，想到谈判专家被叫来，有电话线，对方远在天边。你被请来，你知道，在帐篷里或临时搭建的地点。你进来，拿起电话开始说话。请分享一些故事，如果有一个谈判让你至今难忘，那是什么样的情景？你能帮助我们理解当时的情况吗？对你正在对话的人，以及你当时在做什么？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> When we talk, when we when we
say hostage, you know, hostages,
hostage negotiations, I think we
we tend to think of movies and
we tend to think of, you know,
the negotiator has been called
in.
There's a phone line, the person
is far away.
You are now brought in, you
know, the sort of the tent or
temporary sort of setup.
You come in, you grab the phone
and you start talking.
Help me understand some of the
stories.
If there was one negotiation
that sticks in your mind to this
day.
What is can you help us
understand what that situation
was on both ends for the person
that you were talking to, but
what you were doing?
</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 哦，当然。你描述的电影场景，大部分都很准确。基本上就是那样。当有人持武器时，我们不希望进行面对面谈判，因为危险性相当大。所以是电话交谈。我记得我曾与一个情绪失控的男人进行谈判，他劫持了他的分居妻子和四岁的女儿为人质，并威胁要伤害她们，甚至要伤害他自己。我记得我拿起电话，对他说：“嘿，我叫Paul，我是谈判专家，我来帮忙。” 然后我们开始对话，我问他：“告诉我你脑子里在想什么？你现在在哪里？发生了什么？” 然后我聚焦于他对女儿的爱。这成为了一个关键点，去了解对他来说最重要的是什么。“对你来说，什么最重要？你想伤害你的女儿吗？” 有时候你必须问那些艰难的问题。通过那次谈话，我让他敞开心扉，意识到什么对他来说才是真正重要的，然后我与他合作，让他达到一个状态——这需要时间——让他明白，为了所有人的最大利益，是时候释放孩子了，是时候释放他的妻子了。但首先我必须让他走到门口，幸运的是，那是一次非常非常艰难的谈判，但成功了。所有人都活了下来。这就是我们努力的目标。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Oh, absolutely.
And what you described in the
movies.
>> Many accurate.
>> Very.
Okay.
Yeah.
For the most part.
And that's exactly what it is.
We don't want face to face
negotiations when there's
somebody holding a weapon.
Because the danger is quite
significant.
So the telephone conversation
and reaching someone I remember
negotiating with a man who was
distraught, and he had taken his
his estranged wife and his four
year old daughter hostage, and
he had threatened to harm them
before and to take their lives
and to take his own.
And I just remember getting on
the phone with him and
establishing that, hey, my name
is Paul, I'm the negotiator.
I'm here to help.
And we then engaged in a
conversation where I asked him
to tell me what was going on in
his mind, like, where are you
right now?
What's happening?
And then focusing on the love he
had for his daughter.
And and that became a catalyst
to find out what mattered to him
the most.
What matters to you here?
And do you want to harm your
daughter?
Sometimes you have to ask the
hard questions.
And through that conversation,
what I had him do is open up and
realise what really was
important to him, and then work
with him to get him to a state
where it took time, but where he
understood that in everybody's
best interest, it was time to
release the child.
It was time to release his wife.
But first I had to get him to
the door, which fortunately.
And that was a very, very hard
negotiation.
It worked.
Everybody lived.
And that's what we're looking to
do.
</details>

### 特朗普的性格与谈判考量

**主持人**: 让我们回到特朗普。他的性格可能有点反复无常，也许有些人一天到晚都无法预测他会走向何方。你知道，如果看他的社交媒体，深夜的一条推文就能让世界陷入混乱。但基于我们对唐纳德·特朗普的了解，一个谈判专家在考虑他时，最重要的性格方面是什么？正如你所说，在进行谈判之前，你会先了解对方是谁。我们对他了解多少？对你来说，哪些方面最突出，让你觉得可以去谈判？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Let's return back to Trump in
the sense of his personality
might be a bit erratic, where
maybe some people might not be
able to to sense from one day to
the next where he's going to be,
you know, if you're on his, on
his socials, it's, you know, a
late night text sort of sends
the world into a bit of chaos.
But knowing what we know about
Donald Trump, what are the most
important aspects of his
character for a negotiator to
keep in mind?
As you mentioned, when you go
into these negotiations, you get
a sense of who they are before.
What do we know about him, and
what are the ones that stick out
to you as something, as someone
who would go into a negotiation?
</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 他非常专注于获取各种东西，金钱是其中之一。他说他心中装着美国的最佳利益，他提出了一些相当严厉的主张。他在许多方面做得不错，但在其他方面，感觉他确实在主导事情的发展方式。谈判者必须以开放的心态来处理这种情况，并建立融洽的关系，因为当一个人认识你、喜欢你、信任你时，他们就更愿意与你合作。我们不一定总要同意我们正在讨论或谈判的对象，但我们当然必须让他们说话，让他们感觉被倾听、被理解。否则，就没有成功的可能。再次强调，这归结为信任和好感。这些是关键要素，能让你说：“好吧，我们如何一起努力让这件事奏效？”
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> He's very focussed on
acquiring a number of different
things, and and money is one of
them.
He he says that he has the best
interests of the United States
in hand, and he's making some,
some pretty harsh claims.
He's doing some good in many
areas, but in other areas it
feels like he is really
dictating the way things are
going to happen.
A negotiator has to approach
that with an open mind and
establish a rapport, because
when somebody knows you, likes
you and trusts you, they're more
willing to work with you.
We don't always have to agree
with the person that we're
discussing or negotiating with,
but we certainly have to let
them speak and to have them feel
like they're being heard and
feel like they're being
understood.
Unless we do that, there is no
way of succeeding.
And again, it comes down to
trust, likeability.
And those are the important keys
that will get you to say, well,
how is it that we can work
together to make this work?
</details>

**主持人**: 你想澄清一下，唐纳德·特朗普此刻并不是字面意义上地劫持人质，对吧？我们当然是在谈论理论上的人质。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Do you want to clarify that
Donald Trump is not literally
taking hostages at the moment?
We're talking theoretical ones,
of course.
</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 不，绝对不是，绝对不是。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> No, absolutely, absolutely.
</details>

### 谈判原则的应用与局限

**主持人**: 我确实想了解一下你所受训和使用过的人质谈判原则。它们是否真正适用于像唐纳德·特朗普这样的人？然后，类比在哪里会失效，也就是说，你必须应用一些稍微不同的东西？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> I do want to understand sort
of the hostage negotiation
principles that you have trained
on that you've used.
Do they like which ones
genuinely transfer to someone
like Donald Trump?
And then where do the analogies
break down, where, you know,
this is someone where you're
going to have to apply something
a little different.
</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 人质谈判的方法适用于所有情况。我在商业领域也教授这些。在任何地方，都有方法可以接近一个人，让他感到被倾听。就像我之前说的。它会考虑到他们正在经历什么，因为每个人都在经历不同的事情。但除非我们有探究的精神并向人们提出这些问题，否则我们永远不会知道。所以，方法就是开放、愿意合作。如果有冲突，愿意通过冲突来解决。当人们停止沟通，或者举手说：“听着，我受够了，你根本不理解我。” 这就是谈判失败的地方。就像人质谈判一样。如果我有一个劫持了四名人质的劫持者，如果我无法相处，不愿意敞开心扉并花时间，这需要时间。但如果我到了那个地步，我说：“听着，John，好吧，我们就是合不来，你留两个人质，给我两个人质，我们今天就到此为止。” 你不能这样做，对吧？你必须坚持到底，尽你所能有意义地工作，让谈判继续下去。有时会很艰难。你必须回去重新调整，重新思考，重新尝试。我看不出这种情况会发生。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> The hostage negotiator
approaches work in every
circumstance.
And I teach this in business.
And everywhere there is, there
is a way of approaching an
individual that makes them feel
heard.
As I said earlier too.
And it takes into consideration
what they're going through
because everybody is going
through something different.
But unless we have an inquiring
mind and ask these, these things
of people, we'll never know.
So the approach is one of
openness, one of willingness to
to work.
And if there is a conflict
willing to work through that
conflict, where it falls apart
is where people stop
communicating or put their hands
up and say, listen, I've had
enough of this, and you don't
see things my way.
It's like hostage negotiator.
If I if if I had a hostage taker
who had four hostages, if I
wasn't getting along, wasn't
willing to open up and take the
time, it takes time.
But if I was at that point where
I said, listen, John, okay,
we're just not getting along,
how about you keep two hostages
and you give me two hostages?
We'll call it a day.
You can't do that, right?
You have to stay in for the long
run and work as as meaningful as
you possibly can to keep that
negotiation going.
Sometimes it's going to be
rough.
You have to go back and and
regroup, rethink re-approach.
I don't see that happening.
</details>

### 公开场合的谈判挑战

**主持人**: 我想说一点不同之处，可能与你提到的其中一个例子不同，那些谈判是在电话里私下进行的，没有太多噪音。而我们看到唐纳德·特朗普，正如我们提到的，是通过社交媒体，我们看到新闻发布会。当你提到“伏击”这个词时，很多人会想到泽连斯基在白宫与唐纳德·特朗普会面，你知道，两位领导人面对面。那同样不是任何形式的谈判。但是，当谈判对象是为了观众、为了媒体上的支持者而表演时，谈判是如何变化的？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> I want to what's a little bit
different from perhaps some of
the negotiations, as you
mentioned, with one of your
examples, these are done
privately on a phone call.
There's not a lot of noise.
What we're seeing with Donald
Trump is, as we mentioned,
social media, we're seeing press
conferences.
When you talk about the word
ambush, I think a lot of people
think of, you know, Zelensky
meeting Donald Trump in the
white House and, you know, two
leaders across from each other.
And that was, again, not a
negotiation of any sort.
But what how does the
negotiation change when the
subject is performing for an
audience, their supporters on
media, for example?
</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 情况会发生变化，因为我认为这是一种不被理解的表现，或者是一种自我展示，说：“看，是我，看我有多强硬。” 在某些情况下，当一个人为了媒体而捶胸顿足，说“要么听我的，要么走人”时，你有时就是无法与处于那种心态的人进行谈判，至少在那时不行。然后在幕后，必须有其他方式和手段去尝试接触和重新谈判，并保持那种开放性和意愿。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> It changes because I believe
it's a matter of not being
understood or throwing yourself
out there and saying, look, it's
me, look how tough I am.
And that's going to happen in
certain situations where an
individual for the media will
strike their chest and say, it's
my way or the highway, and
sometimes you just can't
negotiate with someone who is in
that state of mind, not at that
time.
And then in the background,
there has to be other ways and
means of trying to reach out and
renegotiate and have that
openness and that willingness.
</details>

### 寻求筹码与谈判的意义

**主持人**: 有些人可能会说，这是唐纳德·特朗普在试图在某些情况下获得筹码。你对此怎么看？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Some might say that this is
Donald Trump trying to get
leverage in some of these
situations.
What do you say to that?
</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 我说这是真的。是的，我说在他看来，这非常真实。我无法确切告诉你这一切起源于何处。但是的，他确实想要筹码。我们在许多情况下都能看到这一点，即某些东西被剥夺，几乎是从人们手中夺走。这就是为什么他们感觉像人质。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> I say that's true.
Yeah, I say that that that's
very true in his mind.
And I can't go back and tell you
exactly where this all
originated from.
But yes, he does want leverage.
And we're seeing that in many
instances where certain things
are being taken, almost taken
away from people.
That's why they're feeling like
hostages.
</details>

**主持人**: 很多人想知道，为什么还要费力去拿起电话，甚至保持那条线畅通呢？为什么不直接挂断？为什么？为什么还要费力与特朗普谈判？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> There are many folks who
wonder why even bother picking
up the phone or even keeping
that line active.
Why not just hang it up?
Why?
Why even bother negotiating with
Trump?
</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 想象一下不这样做。想象一下不站出来，不采取一切可能的行动。正当的行动。想象一下就放弃，说：“好吧，你全拿去了。” 当人们不表达他们的反对意见，并且不以和平方式表达时，一切都会被夺走。我们的权利，我们的声音，我们的特权。这就是为什么继续与像特朗普这样的人谈判，或者继续对你认为是错误的事件进行和平抵抗如此重要。因为不这样做，就会让你成为我们所说的那种人质。你觉得你现在是人质了，那就放弃与特朗普谈判吧。放弃谈论你认为在你国家里存在的不公。那么《1984》就近在眼前了。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Imagine not.
Imagine not standing up and and
taking whatever action you
possibly can.
Rightful action.
Imagine just giving up and
saying, okay, you got it all.
When people don't express their
opposition and do it in a
peaceful way, then everything
will be taken away.
Our rights, our voices, our
privileges.
This is why it's so important to
continue to negotiate with
someone like Trump, or to
continue to do peaceful
resistance as to what you see as
an injustice, because not doing
it makes you that hostage we're
talking about.
You think you're a hostage now
give up on on negotiating with
Trump.
Give up on speaking about what
you feel are injustices within
your country.
And 1984 is right around the
corner.
</details>

### 给谈判专家的建议

**主持人**: 让我们谈谈我们国家的主要谈判代表，马克·卡尼。我来引用电影里的说法。如果你发现自己和卡尼在同一部电梯里，也许你有 30 秒的时间，在他离开之前。你会给他什么建议，当他进入与唐纳德·特朗普的又一轮谈判时？
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Let's talk about our lead
negotiator here in this country,
Mark Carney.
I'm going to play to the movies
here.
If you found yourself in an
elevator with Carney,
maybe you've got 30 seconds
before he goes.
What advice would you give him
as he enters another round of
negotiations with Donald Trump?
</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 学会如何谈判。学会如何说话，如何倾听，并表现出真诚的兴趣。我会这么说。你必须采取立场，并且要带着一定的权威，但你也必须愿意倾听。再次强调，我回到史蒂芬·柯维（Stephen Covey）多年来所说的，在他的书和演讲中：首先寻求理解，然后才被理解。知道你想要从交易中得到什么，但也要问对方。愿意参与并建立信任，而不是采取攻击性姿态。但我还没看到过这样的谈判。这就是问题所在。我还没看到过。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Learn how to negotiate.
Learn how to learn how to to
speak, to listen and to show
genuine interest.
I would say.
You have to take a stance and
you have to do it with a certain
amount of authority, but you
also have to be willing to
listen.
And again, I go back to what
Stephen Covey has said for many,
many years.
And in his books and his speaks,
his talks seek first to
understand, then to be
understood.
Know what you want out of the
deal, but also ask the other
individual.
Be willing to engage and build
that trust, not take an
offensive.
But I haven't seen a
negotiation.
That's the problem.
I haven't seen that.
</details>

**主持人**: 好的，Paul，我们就谈到这里。非常感谢你的时间。感谢你在这件事上的见解。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Okay, Paul, we are going to
have to leave it there.
I really appreciate your time.
Thank you for your insights on
this one.
</details>

**J. Paul Nadeau**: 非常感谢。
<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

>> Thank you very much.
</details>
