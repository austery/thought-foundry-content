### 加拿大腐败风险：警钟与对策

**主持人**: Salvatore Cusumano 是 **Transparency International Canada** 的执行董事，他来到我们演播室。您好吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Salvatore Cusumano is the executive director of Transparency International Canada, and he joins us in studio. How are you doing?

</details>

**Salvatore Cusumano**: 很好。谢谢您邀请我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cusumano**: Great. Thank you for having me.

</details>

**主持人**: 很高兴您能来。我们今天来谈谈**腐败**。所以我想，我们从最近在多伦多及更广泛地区引起头条新闻的**腐败丑闻**开始谈话是公平的。您对目前的多伦多**警方腐败丑闻**有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Great to have you here. Let's start off with we're here to talk corruption. So I think it's fair that we start the conversation with corruption scandal that's taken the headlines here in Toronto and broader. But what's your take on the Toronto police corruption scandal right now?

</details>

**Salvatore Cusumano**: 我觉得，这（丑闻）非常清晰地、尽管不幸地说明了**腐败**在**加拿大**是如何运作的。当然，这些指控尚未被证实。我今天所说的一切，当然都是尊重现有的正当程序和正在进行的调查的。但我想这表明，**腐败**需要双方配合（it takes two to tango）。我的意思是，一方面，当我们谈论**腐败**时，确实有**公职人员**愿意参与这种行为，他们会利用自己的权力或权威来谋取个人、私利或潜在的犯罪利益。另一方面，也有另一方，即在某些情况下促成腐败、甚至胁迫腐败的外部行为者或政党。在这个案例中，我们不幸地看到，一些为公众服务的**公职人员**可能卷入了某些行为，而这些行为是由那些试图以非常邪恶的目的来利用**公共机构**的外部行为者所促成的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cusumano**: I mean, I think it shows us it's a really elegant, if unfortunate illustration of how corruption works in Canada. Of course, the allegations haven't been proven yet. And anything I say today, of course, is really respectful of the due process that exists and the investigations that are continuing. But I think it shows you that with corruption, it takes two to tango. What I mean by that is that on the one hand, when we talk about corruption, you do have public officials who have to be willing to engage in the behaviour, people who are going to use their position of power or authority to personal, private or potentially criminal benefit. On the other hand, you have just that, which is an actor or a party that motivates the corruption in some cases, maybe coerces the corruption. And, you know, in this case, we see, unfortunately, allegations of public officials serving the public who may have been tied up in behaviour by actors who were looking to exploit a public institution for some very nefarious purposes.

</details>

**主持人**: 您用了“清晰”（elegant）这个词。请解释一下？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: You use the word elegant. Help explain that?

</details>

**Salvatore Cusumano**: 我认为它之所以“清晰”，是因为，你知道，在 **Transparency International**，我们是这个全球组织的加拿大分部。而它之所以“清晰”，是因为它是一个非常、非常明确的例证，如果（指控）被证实的话，它揭示了我们加拿大的**机构**面临的**脆弱性**。一方面，我认为调查应该能指出我们**机构**中可以改进的系统性倾向。但另一方面，这确实显示了**有组织犯罪**在**加拿大**日益增长的担忧，以及**有组织犯罪**如何真正影响我们**机构**的**廉洁性**。所以，从这个意义上说它是“清晰”的，因为它公之于众了。我们很幸运能看到它。我们也赞赏那些将其公之于众的调查人员。这其中也有“清晰”之处，即我们看到了我们投入到这些调查中的资源的成效。但不幸的是，其负面影响也是显而易见的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cusumano**: Well, I think it's elegant because, you know, at Transparency International, we're the Canadian chapter of a of a global organization. And what's elegant is that it's a really, really clear illustration. If it's proven of the vulnerabilities that our institutions face in Canada. On the one hand, you know, I think the investigations hopefully will point to some of the sort of systemic tendencies that we could improve in our institutions. But on the other hand, it does show a rising concern with organized crime in Canada and the way that organized crime can, can really impact the integrity of our institutions. And so it's elegant in that sense because it's come out in public. We're fortunate to see it. And we do applaud the investigators who brought it to light. There's elegance in that too, that we see the impact of the resources we put into these types of investigations. But unfortunately, the downsides are evident as well.

</details>

**主持人**: **加拿大**的**警务腐败**，这种情况普遍吗？这些（警察）本来是应该调查腐败案件的机构。所以反过来，这种情况（警察腐败）常见吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: How corruption in policing is that, is that rare in Canada? These are the institutions that would sort of be investigating corruption cases on their own. So we flip that case is it rare to see.

</details>

**Salvatore Cusumano**: 这是个好问题。一方面，我希望正在进行的调查能告诉我们，这（事件）是多伦多警察局及多伦多地区警务服务部门的一个孤立事件。但并非如此，我们在**加拿大**的警察部门中见过**腐败**案例。我们也见过其他类型的**不当行为**。有时两者是相关的。但我认为真正的启示是，有时**加拿大**人会觉得“腐败”这个词指的是别处发生的事情，指的是非民主国家发生的事情。我认为我们在这里看到的是一个真实的提醒：正是这些本应识别、起诉此类行为的**公共机构**，现在也成为了**犯罪组织**的目标，因为它们需要进行它们正在进行的活动。这些是**脆弱的机构**。如果我们放松警惕，随着这些团伙变得更加复杂，这种行为可能会变得更加普遍。但它确实存在于**加拿大**。它一直存在，我们希望这次是孤立的。但我们得看看结果如何。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cusumano**: That's a good question. And I think that, you know, on the one hand, I hope that the investigations that are going on will tell us, hopefully, that this is an isolated incident in the Toronto police and in Toronto police, Toronto Area police services. But no, we've seen cases of corruption in police services in Canada. We've also seen issues of other types of misconduct that exist. Sometimes the two are linked. But I think the real takeaway here is that I think there's a sense sometimes in Canada that that corruption or the word corruption refers to something that happens elsewhere, that it refers to something that happens in countries that are not democratic. I think I think what we see here is a real reminder that it is these types of public institutions that in this case, are supposed to be identifying, prosecuting this type of behaviour. Criminal organizations are targeting those, those, those entities as well, because they need to carry out the types of activities they're doing. These are vulnerable institutions. And if we let our foot off the gas, as these groups become more sophisticated, this type of behaviour could become more common as well. But it does exist in Canada. It has existed, and we hope in this case it's isolated. But we'll have to see what comes out.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。我们稍微换个话题，我想放大视野，谈谈 **Transparency International** 的 2025 年**《全球腐败感知指数》**。对于不熟悉它的人来说，它是什么？它的**方法论**是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. Well, let's switch gears a bit and I want to zoom out and talk about the Transparency International's 2025 Corruption Perception Index for people who aren't familiar with it. What is it? What's the methodology?

</details>

**Salvatore Cusumano**: 这是个好问题。所以，《腐败感知指数》可以说是目前世界上讨论最多的关于腐败的指数。**Transparency International** 已经做了大约 20 年了。它基本上显示的是**专家**和**商业领袖**对一个国家**腐败程度**的**感知**。现在，当我说是“感知”时，它不是衡量一个国家发生了多少起**警务丑闻**的直接指标。它更多地衡量的是人们对**加拿大**作为经商之地、作为公民之地以及期望其**机构**的**问责制**有多大的**信心**和**确定性**。现在，我们今年看到的排名是，有 182 个国家参与了排名。**加拿大**排在第 16 位。所以你可以说“第 16 名”。我想如果我们现在看米兰-科尔蒂纳（奥运会），我们不会满足于第 16 名。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cusumano**: That's a great question. So the Corruption Perceptions Index is sort of it's probably the most discussed index on corruption in the world right now. Transparency international has been doing it for, for about 20 years. And what it basically shows is the perceptions of experts and business leaders vis a vis the perceived levels of corruption that exist in a country. Now, when I say perceived, it's not a direct measure of how many police scandals took place in the country. It's it's more a measure of what is the confidence and what is the degree of certainty that people have about what kind of place is Canada to do business? What kind of place is Canada to be a citizen and to expect accountability from its institutions? Now, what we saw on the rankings this year, 182 countries were ranked. Canada was 16th from the top. So you could say 16th best. I think if we're looking to Milano Cortina right now, we're not going to settle for 16th.

</details>

**主持人**: 在冰球比赛中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: In hockey.

</details>

**Salvatore Cusumano**: 说得对。但你知道，我认为这再次表明，正如你在**警方丑闻**中所看到的，当我（说）排在第 16 位时，这是一个**下降趋势**，是我们开始该指数以来的最低排名。自 2012 年我们能够标准化分数以来，这在全球范围内可能仍然是一个不错的得分，排在前 10%。但我们担心的是这个**趋势**，因为我们认为它也反映并伴随着**公众对我们机构的信任度下降**，以及一种观念，即在处理这类**犯罪**方面，事情没有正常运作。顺便说一句，你知道，商业领袖参与了构成我们指数的那些指数的统计，这应该引起关注，尤其是在**加拿大**试图实现贸易和投资伙伴关系多元化的时期。你知道，如果我们的国家、我们的**金融体系**被认为不安全、不干净，那么投资者在尽职调查、检查资金去向方面就会增加成本。坦率地说，我们认为在所有方面，包括**公众信任**和**投资者信任**，我们都需要做得更好，扭转局面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cusumano**: Fair enough. But you know, I think it shows again, this it's sort of what you see in the police scandal is that when I say 16th, that's a downward trend, the lowest ranking ever for Canada since we started the index. And since we were able to kind of standardize the scores in 2012, it could still be a good score in a global context. You know, top 10%. But it's that trend we're worried about because we think it also reflects and tracks with declining public trust in our institutions and a perception that things aren't working in some way when it comes to prosecuting these types of crimes. And as an aside, you know, the fact that business leaders are involved in the types of indices that feed into our index, it should be a cause for concern at a time when Canada is trying to diversify its trade and investment partnerships. You know, if our country, if our financial systems are not deemed to be secure, clean, it does increase costs for investors in terms of due diligence, in terms of checking where their money is going. And, you know, we really think on all aspects public trust and investor trust. Frankly, we need to do a much better job and turn the ship around.

</details>

**主持人**: 我不想用同样的奥运会类比，但你知道，当我们看这个（排名）时，很难不进行比较。与其他**民主国家**的同行相比，我们表现如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I don't want to make the same analogy of the Olympics here, but, you know, it's hard not to compete or compare ourselves when we're looking at this. How do we compare to other Democratic peers?

</details>

**Salvatore Cusumano**: 今年出来的一个有趣之处是，我们看到**加拿大**的**民主同行**，如 **G7** 国家、一些 **NATO** 伙伴等，也出现了类似的**持续下滑趋势**。现在，一方面，你可能会觉得，“哦，这里发生的事情并不那么特别。” 我想，当你回想一下，例如，我们的总理在**世界经济论坛**上的讲话，你会看到，在某种意义上，存在一个普遍威胁，许多国家都面临着类似的**公众信任度下降趋势**，我们希望这不会预示着**民主**整体运作的更深层次问题。我们相信**加拿大**可以在这个国家群体中成为领导者。我们的总理也确实说过，他希望我们能成为领导者，他打算让我们成为领导者。我认为这是**民主国家**真正需要共同努力，找出我们**机构**中哪些方面未能赢得**公众信任**，以及我们如何改变这一点的一个领域。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cusumano**: So one of the interesting things that came out this year is we saw a sustained trend of a similar decline among what you might call Canada's peer democracies, countries in the G7, some of its NATO partners, and so on. Now, again, on the one hand, you might be tempted to say, oh, well, what's happening here is not that exceptional. I think when you think back to, for example, what our Prime Minister talked about at the World Economic Forum, you know, you do see, in a sense, a threat that exists across many countries, a similar trend of declining public trust that we hope doesn't signal something deeper about how democracy in general is performing. We we believe that Canada can be a leader in in this community of countries. Our prime minister has certainly said he hopes that we can be he intends for us to be. And I think this is one area where democracies really have to come together and identify what is it about our institutions that is not keeping the public trust, and how can we change that?

</details>

**主持人**: 从全球视角来看，您谈到了**感知**与**实际腐败**的区别。您能举例说明一下**感知**会是什么样子，而**实际情况**又是什么样的吗？当我们看这个指数的靠后部分，那些国家在指数的后半段时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: When we look at sort of from that zoomed out perspective from the global side, you talked about perception versus actual corruption. Can you give us some examples in terms of what a perception would look like versus actual? When we look at maybe down that index, when we get down to the bottom half of these countries.

</details>

**Salvatore Cusumano**: 当然。也许我可以谈谈一个国家的**金融部门**。另一件事是我可以谈谈存在的**企业所有权透明度**类型。这两件事有时可以并存。例如，我们在指数中真正能看到的一件事是，人们对与谁做生意，以及资金流入**加拿大**、流经**加拿大**和流出**加拿大**时，有多大的**信心**。现在，《腐败感知指数》关注的是**公共部门机构**。这一点很重要。但这些更广泛的问题围绕着，我们对哪些公司与**加拿大政府**或例如**安大略省政府**做生意了解多少？我们很幸运，**Transparency International** 能够与各级政府合作，现在有一个**联邦层面**以及几个省份注册的公司的**注册表**，了解它们背后的实际所有者，存在哪些数据。我们认为，在推广到所有省份方面仍有空间。在**加拿大**的**公共部门腐败**中会看到的一个问题是，这是一个复杂的环境。你有**联邦层面**、**省级层面**，甚至在某些情况下还有**市级层面**的法规。由于**加拿大**的复杂性，人们有时需要额外的**确定性**来建立**信任**。我们当然也能从**公民**的角度在**加拿大**看到这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cusumano**: Sure. Maybe one thing I can talk about is the financial sector in a country. Another thing I could talk about is the type of corporate ownership transparency that exists. And these two things can go hand in hand sometimes. For example, one of the things that that we can really see in the index coming through is what kind of confidence exists in who are people doing business with, and where does money come from when it's flowing into Canada, through Canada and out of Canada? Now the Corruption Perceptions Index is about public sector institutions. That's important to mention. But these kind of broader questions around how, how well is it known, what companies are doing business with the Canadian government or with the Ontario government, for example? We are fortunate at Transparency International to have been able to work with government at various levels to have a registry now of companies that are registered at federal level and in a couple of provinces, who's behind them, what data exists? We think that still there could be room to roll this out across all provinces, an issue that you'll see come into public sector corruption in Canada is that it is a complicated environment. You've got regulations at federal level, provincial level, even at some, in some cases municipal level with these things. And because Canada's complex people need an additional level of certainty sometimes to be able to, to, to have, have trust. And we certainly see that in Canada from a citizens perspective as well.

</details>

**主持人**: 鉴于此，**加拿大**采取了哪些措施来加强**信心**，证明我们的**系统**有**防范腐败**的**保障措施**？显然还有很多工作要做，但我们迄今为止做了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: With that, what steps has Canada taken to shore up confidence that our system has safeguards against corruption? Obviously there's work to be done, but what have we done so far?

</details>

**Salvatore Cusumano**: 当然。我们现在有机会与一个负责审查**加拿大**反**洗钱**框架**完整性**的全球机构——**金融行动特别工作组**（**Financial Action Task Force**）——合作。他们目前正在进行一项审查，将评估**加拿大**在过去五年和十年中在加强一个曾被发现存在一些缺陷的框架方面取得了多大进展。现在，**加拿大**已经做了一些我们认为在实践中可以更强的事情。一是打开了“**公司黑箱**”，**联邦层面**的**编号公司**（numbered companies）现在可以在公共注册表中查看。**BC省**和**魁北克省**也是如此。**安大略省**也已宣布将这样做。这提供了一个绝佳的机会，向像这样的机构以及我们的**公民**展示，你不能躲在**编号公司**后面。你必须公开做生意。所以我们可以看到，我们希望这能推广到**加拿大**各地，但这是一个好的步骤。另一个是，我们刚刚看到**加拿大**宣布，政府在 2025 年预算中宣布成立一个新的**金融犯罪机构**，该机构可能会调查我所说的“供应方”，即**组织**试图**腐蚀**我们**机构**的那部分。该机构理论上应该有助于改善**RCMP**、**省级警察**、**Fintrac**（**金融情报部门**）等机构之间的协调。这是一个好步骤。它已在预算中命名，但我们想知道其背后的资源有多少，它将如何协调这些实体，而不是再增加一个。这两件事都具有巨大的潜力，但这在**加拿大**是常有的故事。我们看到好的公告，我们必须真正让它们有效。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cusumano**: Sure we have. We have the fortunate opportunity right now, a global body that looks at the integrity of our anti-money laundering framework in Canada, the Financial Action Task Force, they're actually wrapping up a review right now that's going to look at how far has Canada come over the last five and ten years in, in strengthening a framework that there had been some deficiencies identified. Now Canada has done a couple of things that we think could be stronger in practice. One is opening up that corporate black box numbered companies at the federal level. Now they're they're available for viewing on a public registry, B.C. and Quebec as well. Ontario has announced they're going to do it as well. You know, this is a really good opportunity to show a body like this, but also our citizens that you can't hide behind a numbered company. You've got to you've got to do business openly. So we could see that we hope that will spread out across Canada. But it's a good step. Another one is we just saw Canada announce the government announced in the budget 2025 budget, the creation of a new financial crimes agency, which might look into that sort of supply side. I talked about where you have organizations trying to corrupt our institutions. This agency should theoretically help improve the coordination between bodies like RCMP, provincial level police, Fintrac, the financial intelligence unit. That's a good step. It's been named in the budget, but we would want to know what kind of resources are behind it. How is it going to harmonise those those entities rather than add another one to the mix? Those are two things that they have great potential, but it's kind of the story. In Canada. We see good announcements. We have to really make them effective now.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。**卡尼总理**（Prime Minister Carney）的政府通过了《**加拿大建设法案**》（Building Canada Act），以加快被视为符合国家利益的**基础设施项目**。当我们看到“加快”时，我们会想到事情会加速，但可能会遗漏一些东西。这是否会带来**腐败**的机会？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. Prime Minister Carney's government passed the Building Canada Act to expedite infrastructure projects deemed in the nation's interest. When we see expedite, we think things are going to speed up there. There might be some things that are missing there. Are there any risks that this would create opportunity for corruption?

</details>

**Salvatore Cusumano**: 当然。我认为，根据我们**Transparency International Canada** 通过国际网络了解到的情况，当你在加快商业运作、投资和公共资金支出方式的同时，如果没有相应地提高**透明度**和**监督**水平，**公共资金**就会被滥用。我们可以看看**新冠疫情**期间发生了什么。我认为，每个人都知道一些发生的**公共资金滥用**事件，比如 **Arrivecan** 这个名字，它本应是我们国家安全和改善公共健康的骄傲，但现在却因我们的**资金**如何被使用而成为一个臭名昭著的名字。如果我们在这样一个关键时刻处理不当，这类事件可能会成倍发生。因此，当我们看到例如成立一个新的**国防投资机构**时，你知道，这可以成为改善我们国家国防的非常好的方式。但我们需要确保，当你创建这类渠道时，有机会尽可能地对公众保持开放，即使是像国防这样敏感的事情，也要公开资金的去向，确保资金是竞争性地支出的，并且最终确实改善了我们的国防。因为这是底线。如果我们花钱却没有改善国防，那就会损害**公众信任**。**基础设施**和许多其他优先事项也是如此。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cusumano**: Certainly. I think that we at Transparency International Canada know through our international network that when you speed up the way you do business, the way you make investments, the way you spend public money, if at the same time you're not increasing transparency and increasing oversight at a similar rate, public money is going to be misspent. We could look at what happened during Covid, for example. I think that everybody knows some of the public misspending that took place, the name Arrivecan, while it should have been a source of pride for something that secured our country and improved our public health, it's now become an infamous name in terms of how our money is, is, is spent that incident could be multiplied many, many times over. If we don't manage this critical moment the right way. And so when we see the creation of things like, for example, a new Defence investment agency, you know, that can be a very good way of helping improve our country's defence. But we need to make sure that when you do create these kind of channels, that there is an opportunity to, to be open with the public as much as you can with something as sensitive as defence about where the money is being spent, that it's being spent competitively, and that it is actually, at the end of the day, improving our defence. Because that's the bottom line. If we spend money and it doesn't improve our defence, that will undermine public trust. Same goes with infrastructure and many other priorities.

</details>

**主持人**: 非常快速地问一下。当我们谈论**加拿大**时，很难不谈到**美国**。对一些人来说，**美国**在某种程度上一直是“世界警察”。在这个政府的领导下，他们在**反腐败**方面做得怎么样？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Very quickly. When we're talking about Canada, it's hard not to have a conversation about the US as well. To some, the US has been the world's policeman to some extent. How have they been doing at policing corruption under this administration?

</details>

**Salvatore Cusumano**: 嗯，他们已经宣布了对某些法律的执法**回滚**，而这些法律对于将**美国**内外的人绳之以法至关重要。现在，我认为我们将看到，现在还为时过早，如果你能想象一年后的情况，我们已经看到了这么多。但在这一方面，我认为现在判断其走向还为时过早。这再次提醒我们，这些事情可能会被**武器化**。它提醒我们，你不希望让自己成为目标。我们需要在所有这些事情上做到无可挑剔。这不仅仅是潜在的执法**回滚**，还可能以符合借口的方式使用它们。我们已经看到本届政府以**芬太尼**流入**美国**为由，来施加关税。这只是一个呼吁，说明无论我们南方发生什么，我们都可以做很多事情来做得更好。让我们不要给任何人留下指责的理由。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Cusumano**: Well, they've announced the rollback of certain of the enforcement of certain laws that were instrumental in bringing people to justice, both in the US and abroad. Now, I think what we'll see, it's still early to tell, if you can imagine a year in, we have seen so much. But on this front, I think it's still early to tell where it will go. It's again a reminder that these things can be weaponized. It's a reminder that you don't want to make yourself a target. We need to be impeccable on all of these things. It's not just the potential of rolling back enforcement, it's the potential of using it in ways that suit pretexts. We have seen this administration use, you know, the justification of, of Fentanyl flowing across the border into the US as a reason to apply tariffs. It's just a call to say whatever is happening south of us, there are so many things we can do to get better. Let's not give anyone a reason to point the finger.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的，我们就谈到这里。我非常感谢您的见解。非常感谢。
