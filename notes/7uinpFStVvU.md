### 核军备条约

**Tracy Mumford**: 来自《纽约时报》，这是今日头条。我是 Tracy Mumford。今天，2月5日，星期四。以下是我们正在报道的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Tracy Mumford. Today's Thursday, February 5th. Here's what we're covering.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 我现在要宣读的声明，将同时在莫斯科和华盛顿发布。华盛顿时间中午12点，莫斯科时间晚上7点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: The statement that I shall now read is being issued simultaneously in Moscow and Washington. Washington 12:00, Moscow 7 p.m.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 回顾20世纪70年代初，冷战期间，尼克松总统创造了历史，宣布他正致力于达成一项美苏之间的核军备条约。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Back in the early 1970s, in the middle of the Cold War, President Nixon made history, announcing he was working toward a nuclear arms treaty between the US and the Soviet Union.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 双方采取这一举措，是出于这样的信念：这将为进一步限制所有战略武器的谈判创造更有利的条件。那项条约开启了一个新时代，世界超级大国承认军备竞赛失控存在危险。条约签署后，核武器储备量急剧下降。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: The two sides are taking this course in the conviction that it will create more favorable conditions for further negotiations to limit all strategic arms. That treaty ushered in a new era where the world's superpowers acknowledged there was a danger to letting the arms race spin out of control. After they signed it, stockpiles of nukes dropped drastically.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 所以今天，在过去的几十年里，我清晰而坚定地声明，美国致力于寻求一个没有核武器的世界的和平与安全。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: So today, in the decades since, I state clearly and with conviction, America's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 美国签署了一系列更新的条约。最近的一项是在2010年奥巴马总统任期内签署的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: The US signed on to a series of updated treaties. The most recent one was under President Obama in 2010.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 总统先生，请原谅，您只有三周时间来处理这件事。这是怎么回事？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Mr. President, just one excuse me, you just have three weeks on this though. What is it?

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 嗯，如果它到期了，就到期了。我们会达成一个更好的协议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Well, if it expires, it expires. We'll do a better agreement.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 但截至今天，它已经到期了。因此，自1972年以来，美国和俄罗斯首次在武器库规模上没有任何限制。许多专家同意特朗普政府的论点，即该条约需要更新。它需要涵盖更多类型的武器，并且需要更多国家签署等等。但完全没有军备控制协议，恰逢世界各国领导人正在考虑扩大其军事能力之际。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: But as of today, it has expired. And so for the first time since 1972, the US and Russia have no limits on the size of their arsenals. Many experts agree with what the Trump administration has argued, that the treaty was in need of updates. It needed to cover more types of weapons and more countries needed to sign on etc. But the complete absence of an arms control agreement comes at the very moment world leaders are considering expanding their capabilities.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: **俄罗斯**已进行试射，以准备太空核武器，并测试一种可能引爆弹头并引发放射性海啸的**水下无人机**。**中国**现在拥有世界上增长最快的核武库，正试图与莫斯科和华盛顿抗衡。而**日本**、**韩国**和**土耳其**这些非核国家，现在正在讨论是否需要改变方针。欧洲的一些国家也在考虑同样的问题，感觉自己不再能依赖美国提供保护，可能需要拥有自己的武器。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Russia has done test launches to prepare for nuclear weapons in space and to test of an underwater drone that could detonate a warhead and trigger a radioactive tsunami. China now has the world's fastest growing nuclear arsenal, trying to rival Moscow and Washington. And Japan, South Korea, and Turkey, which are non-nuclear countries, are now discussing whether they need to change course. Some countries in Europe are wondering the same, feeling like they can no longer rely on the US for protection and might need their own weapons.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 分析人士表示，这使得特朗普政府面临一个选择。美国可以扩大自己的武器库并开发专用武器来跟上步伐。或者，它可以尝试谈判一项新的、更广泛的协议。但这将需要特朗普向莫斯科施压，并且需要中国就此议题进行接触，而中国迄今为止一直拒绝这样做。目前，美国两位顶尖的核专家警告说，“核武器正以一种复仇的姿态回归。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Analysts say it leaves the Trump administration with a choice. The US can expand its own arsenal and develop specialized weapons to keep up. Or it can try and negotiate a new, broader deal. That would require Trump pushing on Moscow, though, and it would require China to engage on the topic, which it has so far refused to do. For now, two of the US's leading nuclear experts have warned that quote, "Nuclear weapons are back with a vengeance.

</details>

### 检察官事件

**Tracy Mumford**: 本周在明尼苏达州，一名联邦检察官在法官面前发表了一番相当惊人的言论。**朱莉·李**（Julie Lee）正在接受质询，关于特朗普政府为何一直无视法院命令，释放本不应被拘留的移民。作为回应，她说：“你想让我怎么办？这个系统太烂了。这份工作太烂了。” 李说，她的办公室挤满了移民案件，以至于她希望法官直接判她藐视法庭，这样她就能睡一会儿觉了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: In Minnesota this week, a federal prosecutor was in court in front of a judge when she made a pretty wild statement. Julie Lee was being grilled about why the Trump administration has been ignoring court orders to release immigrants who shouldn't have been detained. And in response, she said, quote, "What do you want me to do? The system sucks. This job sucks." Lee said her office was so slammed with immigration cases that she wished the judge would just hold her in contempt of court so that she could get some sleep.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 第二天，她就被解雇了。但她戏剧性的爆发，暴露了特朗普激进的移民镇压行动在法院系统引发的混乱，不仅在明尼苏达州，而且在全国范围内都是如此。逮捕人数的激增意味着案件如洪水般涌来。李说，在过去的几周里，她个人负责了大约90起案件。积压的案件导致许多移民被滞留，违反了司法命令和他们的宪法权利。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: The next day, she was fired from her position. But her dramatic outburst points to the chaos that Trump's aggressive immigration crackdown has triggered in the court system, not just in Minnesota, but across the country. The surge of arrests has meant a flood of cases. Lee said that in the last few weeks she personally found herself overseeing about 90 of them. The backlog has left scores of immigrants stuck in detention in violation of judicial orders and their constitutional rights.

### 移民执法

**Tracy Mumford**: 与此同时，总统先生，说到明尼苏达州，您学到了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Meanwhile, Mr. President, speaking of Minneapolis, what did you learn?

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 嗯，我学到的是，也许我们可以稍微采取更温和的方式，但你仍然必须强硬。这些人是罪犯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Um, I learned that uh maybe we can use a little bit of a softer touch, but you still have to be tough. These are criminals.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 特朗普总统表示，他已命令约700名联邦移民特工离开明尼苏达州。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: President Trump said that he's ordered about 700 federal immigration agents to leave Minnesota.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 这是明智的执法，而不是减少执法。他的边境政策是这样的。汤姆·H·霍曼（Tom H. Homeman）表示，政府正在进行部分撤离，因为一些县与移民官员合作，尽管他没有具体说明有多少。该州最大的县，即明尼阿波利斯所在的县，并未改变其长期以来反对与**ICE**合作的政策。目前，约有2000名联邦特工将留在明尼苏达州。明尼阿波利斯市长**雅各布·弗莱**（Jacob Fry）称此次撤离是“朝着正确方向迈出的一步”，但他与州长和其他州官员一样，呼吁所有联邦特工撤离。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: This is smart law enforcement, not less law enforcement. His borders are Tom H. Homeman said the administration was doing the partial draw down because some counties were cooperating with immigration officials, though he didn't specify how many. The biggest county in the state, where Minneapolis is, has not changed its long-standing policy against working with ICE. For now, roughly 2,000 federal agents will remain in Minnesota. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Fry called the reduction a step in the right direction, but joined the governor and other state officials in calling for all federal agents to leave.

### 性别手术

**Tracy Mumford**: 本周，两大美国医学组织首次支持限制对未成年人进行性别相关的**手术**。代表医生人数最多的全国性组织——**美国医学会**（American Medical Association）昨天表示，此类手术通常应推迟到患者成年后进行。周二，**美国整形外科医师学会**（American Society of Plastic Surgeons）也提出了基本相同的建议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: This week, for the first time, two major American medical groups have backed limitations on gender-related surgeries for minors. The American Medical Association, the nation's largest organization representing doctors, said yesterday that the procedure should generally be deferred until patients reach adulthood. And on Tuesday, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons recommended essentially the same.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 到目前为止，美国大多数主要医学组织都反对限制此类医疗的努力，其中一些组织，包括**美国儿科学会**（American Academy of Pediatrics），表示他们的立场仍未改变。他们的普遍指导意见是，医生应根据患者的个体需求做出决定，无论其年龄如何。这包括在罕见情况下进行性别肯定手术。但在解释其指导方针的变化时，美国医学会和整形外科医师学会都提到了他们所说的关于这些手术的风险和益处的研究不足。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Until now, most major medical groups in the US have opposed efforts to restrict this kind of care, and several, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, say their positions remain unchanged. Their general guidance has been that doctors should make decisions that take into account patients individual needs no matter their age. That includes in rare cases gender affirming surgeries. But in explaining their changing guidance, both the AMA and the plastic surgeons association pointed to what they said was sparse research on the risks and benefits of the procedures.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 他们的立场转变之际，此类医疗正面临日益增长的政治抵制。特朗普政府已将对未成年人的性别治疗谴责为医疗事故，并将其作为一个频繁的谈论话题。医疗专业人员也因数十起由曾后悔在青少年时期接受性别相关手术的人提起的诉讼而感到不安。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Their shifting stance comes as there's been growing political backlash over this kind of care. The Trump administration has condemned gender treatment for minors as malpractice and made it a frequent talking point. Medical professionals have also been rattled by dozens of lawsuits filed by people who came to regret the gender-related procedures they had as teenagers.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 上周，纽约的一个陪审团裁定一名女子胜诉，该女子声称她在16岁时接受的乳房切除术（当时她认定自己是男性）导致她毁容。她获得了200万美元的赔偿，这是此类案件中的首次医疗事故判决。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: Last week, a jury in New York ruled in favor of a woman who claimed a mastectomy she had at 16 when she identified as male had left her disfigured. She was awarded $2 million, marking the first malpractice verdict in a case like that.

</details>

### 母亲失踪

**Tracy Mumford**: “妈咪，大家到处都在找你。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: "Everyone is looking for you, Mommy, everywhere.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: “我们不会休息。” 在昨晚发布的一段感人视频中，电视新闻主播**萨凡纳·格思里**（Savannah Guthrie）表示，她和她的兄弟姐妹们已准备好听取赎金要求，因为他们正在焦急地寻找他们的母亲。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: We will not rest. In an emotional video released last night, the TV news anchor Savannah Guthrie said she and her siblings were ready to listen to ransom offers as a frantic search for their mother continues.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: “我们需要确切地知道，她还活着，并且你们抓住了她。请联系我们。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: "We need to know without a doubt, that she is alive, and that you have her. Please reach out to us."

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 84岁的**南希·格思里**（Nancy Guthrie）自本周末以来一直失踪。周六晚上，她被送回家，住在一个图森郊外的宁静社区。周日早上，她没有去教堂。她的钱包、手机和汽车都留在了她家里。当警察前去调查时，她家门口的台阶上有血迹飞溅。当地警长说，现场还有其他令人担忧的证据。“里面，外面，到处都是。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: 84year-old Nancy Guthrie has been missing since this weekend. She was dropped off at home in a quiet neighborhood outside of Tucson on Saturday night. On Sunday morning, she didn't show up for church. Her wallet, cell phone, and car were all left at her house. And when police went to investigate, there was red splatter on her front doorstep. The local sheriff said there was other concerning evidence at the scene. Quote, "Inside, outside, all over."

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 在过去的几天里，至少有两家新闻机构报道称，他们收到了疑似**赎金**的信件，其中一封要求数百万美元的**比特币**。官员们表示，他们正在调查这些信件，但到目前为止还没有确定嫌疑人。萨凡纳·格思里是NBC《今日秀》的主播，是该国观看人数最多的早间电视节目主持人之一。她原本将在该频道的冬奥会报道中扮演关键角色，但在她母亲失踪后退出了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: In the past few days, at least two news outlets reported that they had received messages that appeared to be ransom notes, including one that demanded millions of dollars in Bitcoin. Officials say they're investigating the notes, but so far no suspects have been identified. Savannah Guthrie, who's an anchor on NBC's Today Show, is one of the most watched morning TV hosts in the country. She was set to play a key role in the network's Winter Olympics coverage, but pulled out after her mother's disappearance.

</details>

### 冬奥会事故

**Tracy Mumford**: 最后，尽管**奥运会**尚未正式开始，但已有少数几项比赛正在进行中。棘手的是，似乎这里柯尔蒂纳冰壶奥运场馆发生了一次部分**停电**。昨天，就在比赛开始时，灯就熄灭了。来了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: And finally, even though the Olympics haven't officially started, a handful of the competitions are already underway. The tricky thing is, so it appears that there is a a partial power outage here at the Cortina Curling Olympic Stadium that yesterday, right at the very start of the very first event of the games, the lights went out. Here we go.

</details>

**Tracy Mumford**: 停电没有持续多久。一阵小小的欢呼声响起。几分钟后，冰壶运动员们就能重新开始比赛了。但这对东道主**意大利**来说是一个现场直播的尴尬，意大利几个月来一直面临关于其设施是否能准备就绪的质疑。盛大的开幕式将于明天举行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Mumford**: The outage didn't last long. A little cheer goes up. After only a few minutes, the curlers were able to get back at it with their brooms. But it was a liveaction hiccup for Italy, which is hosting the games and has faced questions for months about whether its facilities would be ready. The big show will get underway tomorrow with the opening ceremonies.

</details>
