title: Ben Horowitz 谈 AI 投资：管理哲学、垂直化架构与泡沫背后的真实需求
summary: a16z 联合创始人 Ben Horowitz 深入探讨了风险投资机构的管理之道，解析了为何采用“篮球队”规模的垂直化架构，并对当前 AI 浪潮进行了辩证分析。他强调，尽管估值飙升，但底层客户需求与收入增长是前所未有的，AI 应用层的复杂性正成为超越基础模型的关键竞争点。

### 智力密集型管理：从职能驱动到过程导向

在风险投资领域，管理一家公司与管理一家风投机构（VC Firm）有着本质的区别。在普通公司中，管理层驱动的是特定的职能输出；而在 a16z 这样的机构，**普通合伙人**（General Partner: 风险投资基金中负责投资决策和管理的合伙人）的智商（IQ）浓度极高，他们大多曾是成功的创始人。管理这些顶尖人才的关键不在于给予指令，而在于优化**投资流程**（Investment Process）。

Ben 指出，风投管理中最常见的错误是过度纠结于公司的弱点，而忽略了其卓越之处。投资的真谛在于寻找那些在某一领域做到“世界最强”的团队，而非各方面都“还不错”但平庸的团队。这种管理哲学要求领导者帮助合伙人理解对话如何影响投资决策，并确保他们在承担适度风险的同时，始终对准那些具备极致长板的创业者。

You know, if you want to change the world, you have to believe you can change the world. What you're really trying to find is are they literally the best in the world at a thing, and that's always the thing that's worth investing in, as opposed to they're pretty good at a lot of things, and I can't figure out what they're not good at. We just have a higher concentration of talent here than that's probably possible in a company in terms of sheer IQ. 

It's pretty different than a company in that with a company there are functions, there are things you know people there are very specific outputs that you're driving to. I'm not really telling him [a GP] I'm not giving him that much direction. I'm more kind of helping him understand the process or like how the process of the conversation affects the process of investing and you know kind of how you work your way to the right answer, taking the right amount of risk. The biggest mistake we make is we get too wrapped around the axle about some weakness that a company has as opposed to focusing on what they're great at and how great they are.

### 垂直化架构与“篮球队”原则：规模化下的决策质量

为了在保持决策质量的同时应对“软件吞噬世界”带来的规模扩张，a16z 采用了**垂直化**（Verticalization: 按行业领域划分专门的投资团队）架构。这一策略深受耶鲁基金传奇人物 Dave Swensen 的启发，即一个投资团队的规模不应超过一支篮球队（约 5 人）。这种规模能确保关于投资的讨论保持深度和互动性。

目前 a16z 拥有七个垂直领域，包括加密货币、生物医疗和**美国活力**（American Dynamism: 专注于解决国家级挑战的科技投资领域）。为了避免垂直化导致的部门墙，机构通过交叉参加会议、定期举行 GP 线下研讨会以及建立“非零和”的文化激励机制来确保信息流动。这种文化去除了内耗和政治博弈，使得即使是拥有数百人的大机构，其政治复杂性也低于只有十几个人的小公司。

The most important observation, and this is a conversation Mark and I had with the late great Dave Swensen back in 2009. And what Dave said was an investing team shouldn't be too much bigger than a basketball team. A basketball team's like five people who start, and the reason for that is the conversation around the investments really needs to be a conversation. 

The only way to do it is to verticalize. Software was eating the world, so we had to get bigger in order to address the market. But I didn't want teams being bigger than a basketball team. The communication across the teams, we do in different ways. If the teams are very close like AI infra and AI apps, then we have people from each team going to the other team's meetings. We have the GP offsite twice a year with not much agenda. Politicking gets deincentivized and that's what we have here.

### 决策的底层逻辑：知识、判断力与清晰度的博弈

在管理复杂的风投机构时，Ben 强调领导者的核心职责是设定方向并在冲突时做出决策。**判断力**（Judgment）被定义为智力与知识的结合。在组织中，真正的知识往往存在于“攻击前线”的人员手中——即那些直接与创业者交流、处理具体交易或管理 IT 和财务的个体，而非单纯的管理者。

领导者必须保持对细节的关注，但要避免**微观管理**（Micromanagement: 过度干预下属工作的管理风格）。Ben 认为，组织往往需要的不是绝对的“正确”，而是**清晰度**（Clarity）。当领导者能够迅速消除模糊性并给出明确方向时，组织才能高效运转。这种清晰度源于领导者愿意深入细节，并鼓励员工不要因为怕打扰而隐瞒信息。

If you think about my job, a lot of it is kind of setting the direction and then making decisions when things get into conflict or we're not sure what to do. Decision making, what makes you good at it? It's a combination of intelligence and judgment, which is a combination of intelligence and knowledge. The knowledge in an organization tends to live with the people doing the work, not the managers. 

It's talking to people who are at the point of attack, talking to entrepreneurs. I just spend enough time in the team meetings and I end up knowing a lot about a lot of things. A key thing for leaders is you never want people to think "oh we shouldn't bother them with that." Generally people aren't looking for correctness, they're just looking for clarity. If you have clarity, you can move.

### 投资逻辑的转向：从 ESG 到“美国活力”的实效主义

在选择投资赛道时，a16z 拒绝了传统的 **ESG**（Environmental, Social, and Governance: 环境、社会和公司治理投资标准），转而开创了“美国活力”赛道。Ben 认为 ESG 往往带有奇怪的约束性，容易导致扭曲的决策。相比之下，“美国活力”专注于通过科技现代化国防、公共安全、能源和供应链，其核心逻辑是追求巨大的经济回报，而非单纯的“行善”。

这种转向反映了风投的本质：只有存在真正的技术变革和顶尖人才聚集时，才能产生风险回报。例如，美国国防系统的现代化和稀土矿产的开采问题，都是具有巨大商业潜力的硬核挑战。Ben 强调，风投机构必须首先考虑如何为投资者赚钱，而“美国活力”正是将国家利益与市场回报结合的产物。

We have had a few [vertical ideas] that people have proposed that we haven't done. One was kind of ESG kinds of things, clean tech, green energy. We thought that the right lens on that was much more going to be American Dynamism, because it wasn't weirdly constraining and it was much more oriented around the economic outcome as opposed to the "do good by doing well" phrase. 

Investing is hard enough without introducing other criteria other than "is this thing going to be a giant company and make a lot of money." The US really does have to modernize the way they do defense, we really do have to get much better intelligence in public safety, we've got to solve the energy problem. I want to know what the fund idea is, how do I make money? We have investors, we got to make money.

### AI 范式演进：应用复杂性与市场需求的真实图景

针对当前关于 **AI 泡沫**（AI Bubble）的担忧，Ben 提供了不同的视角。他指出，虽然估值增长极快，但底层的客户采用率和收入增长速度也是史无前例的。与四年前的预测不同，AI 并没有演变成几个全能的“超级大脑”统治一切，而是呈现出应用层极度复杂的态势。

以编程工具 **Cursor** 为例，它集成了 13 个不同的 AI 模型来处理编程的不同维度。这证明了应用层的逻辑和人类行为建模并不会被基础模型简单吞噬。Ben 认为，AI 是一个比以往任何时候都更大的技术市场，其经济影响将远超互联网时代。目前的市场需求非常真实且强烈，甚至 **Nvidia**（英伟达）的市盈率在考虑其增长率后也并非历史性的荒谬。

AI is such a disruptive phenomenon that every incumbent is under threat. A lot of the ways you deal with the threat is you just acquire the DNA of the future. Three or four years ago, people believed the big foundation models would be these giant brains that could do anything better than anybody. It has not played out quite like that. 

For any particular use case, the fat tail of human behavior ends up being something that you have to model and understand very well. Cursor consists of 13 different AI models. The complexity of the application itself is very high and is not subsumed in the foundation model. We've never seen demand like this. We've never seen valuations rise like this, but we've never seen demand rise like this either. The Nvidia multiples aren't outrageous when you look at the growth rate and the size of the earnings.
