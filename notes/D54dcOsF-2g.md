---

### 加沙人质获释与中东和平进程

This morning, Hamas released all of the remaining living hostages held in Gaza.

今天上午，**哈马斯** (Hamas: 巴勒斯坦伊斯兰抵抗运动组织) 释放了所有仍在加沙被扣押的幸存人质。

In Israel, crowds gathered to cheer and wave along a road leading to a military base where some of the hostages were transferred for initial checks and to be reunited with their families.

在以色列，人群聚集在通往一个军事基地的道路两旁欢呼挥手，一些人质被转移到该基地进行初步检查并与家人团聚。

The 20 hostages had been held since October 7th, 2023, and they included Israeli soldiers and people who had been abducted from a music festival.

这20名人质自2023年10月7日以来一直被扣押，其中包括以色列士兵和在音乐节上被绑架的人。

Their release is a crucial part of a ceasefire deal that Israel and Hamas agreed to last week.

他们的获释是以色列和哈马斯上周达成停火协议的关键部分。

Hamas is also required to return the remains of roughly two dozen hostages who have died, though it's unclear how quickly that will happen.

哈马斯还被要求归还大约二十名已故人质的遗体，尽管目前尚不清楚这将多快实现。

In exchange, today Israel began releasing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.

作为交换，以色列今天开始释放近2000名巴勒斯坦囚犯。

Many were bused to the Israeli occupied West Bank, where they stepped off the bus into a cheering crowd.

许多人被巴士送往被以色列占领的**约旦河西岸** (West Bank: 被以色列占领的巴勒斯坦领土)，他们在那里走下巴士，受到了欢呼人群的欢迎。

Under the deal, Israel also partially pulled its troops back in Gaza and started allowing more humanitarian aid to flow into the territory.

根据协议，以色列也部分撤回了在加沙的军队，并开始允许更多人道主义援助流入该地区。

Earlier today, President Trump, who helped broker the agreement between Hamas and Israel, landed in Tel Aviv to meet with hostages' families and deliver a speech to the Israeli parliament.

今天早些时候，曾协助斡旋哈马斯与以色列之间协议的特朗普总统抵达特拉维夫，会见了人质家属并向以色列议会发表了讲话。

In the audience, some people were wearing hats that say "Trump the peace president."

在听众中，有些人戴着写有“特朗普和平总统”字样的帽子。

You can follow live coverage of Trump's remarks at nytimes.com.

您可以在nytimes.com上关注特朗普讲话的实时报道。

After he's done speaking, Trump is expected to fly to Egypt for a summit on what will happen next in Gaza and the wider region.

讲话结束后，特朗普预计将飞往埃及，参加一个关于加沙及更广泛地区下一步发展走向的峰会。

The Egyptian president's office said the goal was to usher in "a new phase of regional security and stability."

埃及总统办公室表示，目标是开启“区域安全与稳定新阶段”。

As multiple world leaders gather for the summit, it remains unclear if the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas will hold and become permanent.

随着多位世界领导人齐聚峰会，以色列与哈马斯之间的停火是否会持续并成为永久性停火仍不明朗。

Two major sticking points in negotiations, whether Hamas will disarm, and whether it will agree that it can no longer rule Gaza, are still unresolved.

谈判中的两个主要症结，即哈马斯是否会解除武装以及它是否会同意不再统治加沙，仍未解决。

### 美国政府停摆与裁员风波

It's day 13 of the government shutdown and across the country more and more Americans are beginning to feel the impact.

政府停摆已进入第13天，全国各地越来越多的美国人开始感受到其影响。

In some Native American communities, key medical services like diabetes monitoring have been cancelled.

在一些美洲原住民社区，糖尿病监测等关键医疗服务已被取消。

Veterans have seen regional benefits offices close.

退伍军人看到区域福利办公室关闭。

And many of the country's fruit and vegetable farmers don't have access to crucial information about what government programs they'll be able to rely on as they plan for next year's crops.

该国许多水果和蔬菜种植者无法获得关于他们明年作物计划中可以依赖哪些政府项目的关键信息。

At the same time, many federal workers got what will be their last paychecks on Friday until the government reopens.

与此同时，许多联邦工作人员在上周五收到了他们的最后一笔薪水，直到政府重新开放。

And thousands of other government workers have lost their jobs altogether.

还有数千名其他政府工作人员则完全失去了工作。

Can you assess how significant these job cuts will be?

你能评估这些裁员会有多严重吗？

Well, the longer it goes on, the more significant they're going to be.

嗯，停摆时间越长，裁员的影响就会越严重。

And to be clear, some of these cuts are going to be painful.

需要明确的是，其中一些裁员将是痛苦的。

This is not a situation that we relish. This is not something that we're looking forward to.

这不是我们乐于看到的情况。这不是我们期待发生的事情。

On Friday, the White House began following through on its threat to use the shutdown to fire federal workers, eliminating more than 4,000 positions across multiple agencies, including the departments of the Treasury and Health and Human Services.

上周五，白宫开始兑现其利用停摆解雇联邦工作人员的威胁，在包括财政部和卫生与公众服务部在内的多个机构中裁撤了4000多个职位。

The process has been somewhat chaotic, though.

然而，这一过程有些混乱。

On Friday night, the administration mistakenly fired hundreds of scientists at the **CDC** (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: 美国疾病控制与预防中心), some of whom specialized in measles and Ebola outbreaks.

周五晚上，政府错误地解雇了数百名**CDC**科学家，其中一些人专攻麻疹和埃博拉疫情。

The administration then spent the weekend scrambling to bring some of them back.

随后，政府整个周末都在努力召回其中一些人。

At the moment, lawmakers remain deadlocked over any effort to reopen the government.

目前，议员们在任何重开政府的努力上仍僵持不下。

Republicans need at least some Democratic support to pass their proposed temporary spending bill, but Democrats say they're holding out for concessions on healthcare funding.

共和党需要至少一些民主党的支持才能通过他们提议的临时支出法案，但民主党表示他们正坚持要求在医疗保健资金方面做出让步。

### 股市下跌与中美贸易紧张

Today, Asian markets opened in the red, with the Taiwan index dropping 2% this morning, reflecting a broader decline across stocks in Asia.

今天，亚洲市场开盘下跌，台湾指数今早下跌2%，反映了亚洲股市的普遍跌幅。

One of the toughest days on Wall Street in months.

这是华尔街数月来最艰难的日子之一。

The slide follows a big drop in stocks in the US on Friday.

此次下跌是在美国股市周五大幅下跌之后发生的。

Investors are on edge after President Trump threatened a massive new wave of tariffs on Chinese goods, sparking fears that the two countries could reignite the trade war that flared up this spring.

特朗普总统威胁对中国商品征收新一轮大规模关税后，投资者感到紧张，这引发了人们对两国可能重新点燃今年春天爆发的贸易战的担忧。

The new tension started when China said last week that it was tightening its grip over **rare earth metals** (Rare Earth Metals: 一组具有独特磁性、发光和电化学性质的17种化学元素), requiring companies to get new licenses to ship them out of the country.

新的紧张局势始于中国上周表示将收紧对**稀土金属**的控制，要求公司获得新的许可证才能将其运出中国。

Those minerals are crucial for making computer chips and batteries, and China dominates production of them.

这些矿物对于制造计算机芯片和电池至关重要，而中国在这些矿物的生产方面占据主导地位。

Its factories process roughly 90% of the global supply.

中国的工厂处理全球大约90%的供应。

For example, it's the only place in the world that refines **Samarium** (Samarium: 一种稀土金属，用于制造高性能磁铁), a material used in American F-35 fighter jets and a wide range of missiles.

例如，中国是世界上唯一提炼**钐**的地方，这种材料用于美国的F-35战斗机和各种导弹。

Trump denounced China's move as sinister and hostile, and said the US will put a 100% tariff on all products from China.

特朗普谴责中国的举动是阴险和敌对的，并表示美国将对所有中国产品征收100%的关税。

That's on top of existing surcharges that he's imposed of at least 30%.

这还不包括他已经征收的至少30%的现有附加费。

He also threatened to call off the in-person talks he scheduled to have this month with the Chinese president on the sidelines of an economic conference in South Korea.

他还威胁要取消本月在韩国举行的一次经济会议期间，他与中国国家主席安排的面对面会谈。

### NBA重返中国市场

Meanwhile, despite the tensions over trade, there was a little breakthrough in US-China relations this past week in basketball.

与此同时，尽管贸易关系紧张，上周中美关系在篮球领域取得了一点突破。

For years, the **NBA** (National Basketball Association: 美国职业篮球联赛) has had a massive fan base in China.

多年来，**NBA**在中国拥有庞大的粉丝群。

By some estimates, at peak viewership, more people watched the NBA Finals in China than in the US.

根据一些估计，在收视高峰期，在中国观看NBA总决赛的人数比在美国还要多。

But that all imploded in 2019 when a manager for an NBA team posted on social media that he supported pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.

但这一切在2019年破裂，当时一名NBA球队的经理在社交媒体上发帖表示支持香港的民主抗议活动。

That infuriated Chinese officials who pulled the NBA from Chinese state TV.

这激怒了中国官员，他们将NBA从中国国家电视台撤下。

The controversy exploded while two NBA teams were in China set to play a pre-season game.

当两支NBA球队在中国准备进行一场季前赛时，这场争议爆发了。

The players told the Times they saw the outrage build in real time, watching from their hotel rooms as workers ripped down huge ads with their faces on them from a nearby building.

球员们告诉《纽约时报》，他们亲眼目睹了愤怒的积聚，在酒店房间里看着工人们从附近的建筑物上撕下印有他们面孔的巨幅广告。

There have been no NBA games in China or its territories since then until this past Friday.

自那时起，中国及其领土上就没有举行过NBA比赛，直到上周五。

"I mean, is this the most exciting live shot I've ever done? We're a couple hours away now from tip off."

“我的意思是，这是我做过的最激动人心的现场直播吗？距离比赛开始还有几个小时。”

The game between the Phoenix Suns and the Brooklyn Nets happened in Macau.

菲尼克斯太阳队和布鲁克林篮网队的比赛在澳门举行。

This game is more than about basketball.

这场比赛不仅仅是关于篮球。

And it was the result of years of negotiations by an American casino mogul, Patrick Dumont, who operates a location in Macau, too.

它是美国赌场大亨帕特里克·杜蒙多年谈判的结果，他也在澳门经营着一个场地。

Casino owners there have been under pressure from the Chinese government to diversify beyond gambling or risk losing their license.

那里的赌场老板一直面临中国政府的压力，要求他们实现业务多元化，超越赌博，否则就有可能失去执照。

And so, Dumont hatched a plan to bring the NBA back to Chinese audiences and to play at his casino's arena in Macau.

因此，杜蒙制定了一个计划，将NBA带回中国观众面前，并在他位于澳门的赌场体育馆进行比赛。

Specifically, this weekend's games were part of a multi-year plan for more.

具体来说，本周末的比赛是多年计划的一部分，未来还将有更多比赛。

In the past, other sports leagues, including the English Premier League, have had riffs with Beijing over questions of human rights and other controversies.

过去，包括英超联赛在内的其他体育联盟，也曾因人权问题及其他争议与北京产生分歧。

In those cases, the leagues have often made concessions to the Chinese government to resolve things.

在这些情况下，各联盟通常会向中国政府做出让步以解决问题。

In the case of the NBA, the league insists it made no concessions.

就NBA而言，该联盟坚称没有做出任何让步。

But in an interview with the Times, the head of the NBA said that the league would have to be flexible in its renewed relationship with Beijing, saying, "If this is about ideological purity on either side, it will never be achieved."

但在接受《纽约时报》采访时，NBA负责人表示，联盟在与北京重建关系时必须保持灵活性，他说：“如果这关乎任何一方的意识形态纯洁性，那将永远无法实现。”

### 哥伦布日与原住民日争议

And finally, today on the federal calendar is **Columbus Day** (Columbus Day: 纪念哥伦布于1492年抵达美洲的美国联邦假日).

最后，今天在联邦日历上是**哥伦布日**。

Post offices are closed. A lot of banks are shut, but across the country, more than a dozen states and cities mark today as **Indigenous People's Day** (Indigenous People's Day: 旨在纪念美洲原住民历史和文化的节日).

邮局关闭，许多银行也停业，但全国有十多个州和城市将今天定为**原住民日**。

There's been a longtime push not to celebrate Columbus, the Italian navigator who sailed to the Americas in 1492 by people who point to the violent colonization that followed his arrival.

长期以来，一直有人呼吁不要庆祝1492年航行到美洲的意大利航海家哥伦布，这些人指出他到来后随之而来的暴力殖民。

In 2020, statues of Columbus became a flash point during racial justice protests after the murder of George Floyd.

2020年，在乔治·弗洛伊德被谋杀后，哥伦布雕像在种族正义抗议活动中成为一个引爆点。

That year, more than 30 were dismantled, either by protesters or officials who took them down.

那一年，超过30座雕像被拆除，或由抗议者拆除，或由官员移除。

Five years later, the Times has been looking at where those statues ended up.

五年后，《纽约时报》一直在调查这些雕像的去向。

Boston's Columbus statue, which was beheaded, ended up being repaired and relocated to a church garden.

波士顿的哥伦布雕像，曾被斩首，最终被修复并重新安置到一座教堂花园里。

Baltimore's was dumped in the harbor by protesters, but the pieces have since been fished out to be used to make a replica.

巴尔的摩的雕像被抗议者倾倒入港口，但碎片此后已被打捞出来，用于制作复制品。

Other Columbus statues have found new homes at museums or Italian-American social clubs.

其他哥伦布雕像则在博物馆或意大利裔美国人社交俱乐部找到了新家。

Italian-American groups have helped with a lot of the restorations and relocations.

意大利裔美国人团体协助了许多修复和重新安置工作。

For them, Columbus is a part of their heritage.

对他们来说，哥伦布是他们遗产的一部分。

A lot of Columbus statues were originally put up years ago as symbols of Italian pride at a time when Italian immigrants faced discrimination in the US.

许多哥伦布雕像最初是在多年前竖立的，作为意大利裔自豪感的象征，当时意大利移民在美国面临歧视。

Meanwhile, some cities have decided to put up new statues altogether where Columbus used to be.

与此同时，一些城市决定在哥伦布雕像原址上竖立全新的雕像。

Newark, New Jersey put up a monument to **Harriet Tubman** (Harriet Tubman: 美国废奴主义者和社会活动家).

新泽西州的纽瓦克竖立了一座纪念**哈丽特·塔布曼**的纪念碑。

San Antonio, Texas, put up a statue of the patron saint of seafarers.

德克萨斯州的圣安东尼奥竖立了一座航海守护神的雕像。

And in New Haven, Connecticut, a bronze statue was unveiled last year that depicts an Italian immigrant family.

而在康涅狄格州纽黑文，去年揭幕了一座描绘意大利移民家庭的青铜雕像。
