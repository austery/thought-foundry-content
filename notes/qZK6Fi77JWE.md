summary: 周四市场经历了一场“丑陋的”抛售，科技股受创尤为严重。本次下跌的核心驱动因素并非单一重磅消息，而是多重忧虑的叠加：白宫未能如期发布关键的CPI数据，引发了市场对经济数据透明度的担忧；威瑞森（Verizon）宣布大规模裁员，加剧了对劳动力市场的悲观情绪；以及多位美联储官员发表鹰派言论，暗示对通胀的担忧超过了对劳动力市场的担忧，导致12月降息的概率大幅下降。尽管市场情绪极度恐慌，但演讲者认为，将此与互联网泡沫相提并论为时过早，因为企业盈利等基本面并未发生根本性改变。此外，本期内容还深入分析了David
  Tepper、Bridgewater和Howard Marks等顶级机构投资者的13F持仓报告，揭示了他们在第三季度的布局策略。

title: 解析市场“丑陋一日”：数据缺失与加息忧虑引发科技股抛售潮
---

### 市场遭遇“丑陋一日”

大家好，欢迎回到新一期的市场收盘分析。今天是11月13日，星期四。今天市场表现非常糟糕，这一点无需讳言。坦率地说，考虑到某些特定板块，尤其是科技板块今天所经历的巨大回撤，这确实是丑陋的一天。对某些股票而言，今天的百分比跌幅甚至比五个月前的“解放日”还要严重，这有点疯狂，因为自那时以来，盈利增长方面已经发生了很多变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market close. We are live. It is Thursday, November 13th. This was an ugly one. There is no way to mince our words about it. This was an ugly one quite frankly based on some of the drawdowns we're seeing in some specific sectors. Obviously technology, that's been the biggest one that we've seen the pain in today. This is worse for some stocks than liberation day if you look at the actual percentage draw down which is kind of crazy given liberation day was five months ago and a lot has happened in terms of earnings growth since then.</p>
</details>

但市场正在担忧，而且是出于多种不同的原因，我们今天将对此进行探讨。显然，今天市场一片惨淡，对每个人来说都是艰难的一天。我今天和很多人发了信息，基本上无处可藏。除非你恰好持有默克（Merck）和辉瑞（Pfizer）这类股票，或者某些周期性股票或消费防御性股票，否则很难幸免。你可能有一些这类敞口，我相信很多人都有，但这可能不是大多数人投资组合的主要部分。大多数人的投资主要集中在与科技相关的领域。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the market is worried and the market is worried for a variety of different reasons that we're going to talk about today and we're going to get into kind of what is going on. Obviously, it is a red day. It is an ugly day for everybody. I was texting a lot of different people today, and there's nowhere to really hide. I mean, you kind of had to be in Merc and Fizer and, you know, maybe certain types of cyclicals or or consumer defensives to really be out of it. You might have some exposure to that like I'm sure a lot of people do but it might not be the majority of the exposure that most people have which is obviously to things that are more tech-related.</p>
</details>

### 各大指数与个股普跌

这就是为什么标普500指数今天下跌了1.58%。它在670点位获得了非常微弱的反弹，我们今天勉强守住了670点，这实际上是一个非常关键的支撑位。算法交易没有让它跌破这个点位，但下跌1.5%仍然是很难看的。亚马逊下跌2%，SoFi下跌11%，Big Bear下跌11%，IRNT下跌12%，D-Wave下跌11%，Rigetti下跌10%。Verizon是当天少数上涨的股票之一。Oscar因为ACA补贴问题下跌了14%，Hims下跌7%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's why the S&P 500 down 1.58% on the day. It did get a very small bounce on 670. We somehow maintained 670 today and that is actually a very key level to maintain. So the algos did not let it go below that but 1.5% down is ugly. Amazon down 2%, SoFi down 11%, Big Bear down 11%, IRNT down 12%, D-Wave down 11, Rigetti down 10, Verizon, one of the only green names that is up on the day. Oscar loses 14 based on this ACA subsidy stuff. Hims is down seven.</p>
</details>

令人难以置信的是，Meta居然挺住了，当天只下跌了1美元，对于像Meta这样的公司在这样的日子里实属不易。即使是Nebius，考虑到数据中心领域的惨状，我本以为它现在会跌破80美元。它能守住89美元实际上是相当有建设性的，尽管它曾从84美元反弹。英伟达下跌3%，一度跌至184美元。Robinhood确实跌破了121美元，最低到了119美元左右，现在回到121美元，但全天仍下跌8%。甲骨文再跌5%。Palantir下跌6%，虽然没有失守170美元，但非常接近。EOSC下跌10%。迪士尼今早发布财报后下跌8%。Netflix下跌1%。显然，今天市场全面下跌，非常糟糕。纳斯达克指数下跌了1.94%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Meta somehow Meta is holding. I mean, Meta's down a dollar on the day, which is quite incredible for a company like Meta on a day like this. Even Nebius, I expected Nebius to be below 80 bucks by now given the carnage in the data center space. The fact that is holding 89 is actually kind of constructive, but that bounced off 84. Nvidia down three. Nvidia at one point got to 184. Robinhood did get below 121. Uh got to like 119, now it's at 121. Still down 8% on the day. Oracle down another 5%. Palantir down 6%. Palantir did not lose 170, but got very close to losing it. EOSC down 10%. Disney had earnings this morning down 8%. Netflix down 1%. I mean, obviously it's an ugly day. It's an ugly day across the board. The NASDAQ right here down 1.94%.</p>

### 市场恐慌的背后：并非单一利空

所有重仓科技股的投资组合都正在经历这种痛苦。在我们深入探讨市场为何如此不安之前——因为并没有像特朗普关于大豆的推文那样明确的重大利空消息，所以需要更深入地挖掘市场担忧的根源——我想先说几句。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and everyone's portfolios who is leveraged into technology is experiencing that. Before we get into kind of what's going on or at least why in my opinion the market is so upset because again there was not that major headline that's out there that you can point to like a Trump tweet about soybeans. So it kind of takes a little bit more digging in terms of figuring out what the market is so concerned about. I do want to say this before we get into it.</p>
</details>

就在我准备说话的时候，天使之光照进了房间，这恰好与我要说的话相符。我想说的是，市场的基本面其实并没有真正改变。上周、两周前，甚至昨天我们距离历史高点仅1%之遥时，市场的基本面都是一样的，并没有发生戏剧性的转变。是的，有一些劳动力市场数据不尽人意；是的，白宫方面态度强硬。这些都是合理的论点，也可能导致一些抛售。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As the angel light begins to flow into the room, right as I'm about to talk, the angel light comes in. It's actually conducive with what I'm about to say. What I was about to say is nothing has really changed. I mean, the fundamentals of this market that were the same last week, two weeks ago, yesterday when we were 1% away from all-time highs, there's not been a sort of dramatic shift. Yes, there's some labor market data that's not pretty. Yes, the White House is not giving up. Like, yes, there's all those arguments and those are reasonable arguments and those arguments probably warrant a little bit of a sell-off.</p>
</details>

但要说市场整体转为熊市，我看不出这个迹象。今天我看到很多人在推特上开始将这次下跌与互联网泡沫相提并论。当你开始看到这类比较时，你就会意识到，人们要么是开始非理性地恐慌，要么是想通过发表负面言论来博取关注，因为他们知道负面情绪更容易吸引眼球。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But in terms of going net bearish, I just don't see it. I see a lot of people on Twitter today starting to compare this to the dot-com bubble. And you know, when you start to see those types of comparisons, you start to realize, okay, people are really getting either, you know, irrationally scared or they're starting to try to get a lot of attention because they see that attention sells and the easiest way to sell is to be negative.</p>
</details>

### 这不是又一次的互联网泡沫

目前，恐惧与贪婪指数显示市场处于“极度恐惧”状态。但将现在与互联网泡沫时期相比并不恰当。如果你看看当时的盈利增长情况，会发现与现在完全不同。当然，债务融资问题是甲骨文和许多数据中心公司受到冲击的原因，这确实值得市场进行一些风险规避。但这并不意味着“人工智能是假的，泡沫正在破裂，一切都不是真的”，或者说过去两年围绕人工智能概念的整个上涨行情都是虚假的。我个人不认同这种说法，很难轻易地认为这是一个站得住脚的论点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We are in extreme fear on the fear and greed index. But again, comparing this to the dot-com bubble, when you look at the earnings growth and what has happened in the dot-com bubble versus now is not necessarily the same. Obviously, the debt financing is why Oracle has been hit and a lot of these data center plays have been hit and and that deserves probably the market to take some risk off. That is not a, hey, AI is fake, the bubble is popping, everything is not real, and you know, this entire two-year run around the concept of artificial intelligence is not real. Like, that to me, I don't know. I'm not buying that. It's hard for me to easily say that that's a legit argument.</p>
</details>

我想在深入分析盘中走势之前强调一点：我们目前的位置仍然高于上周五真正下跌时的水平。我知道今天的下跌强度和速度让很多人感到难受，但我们远未接近10月17日的低点，也远未接近上周五的低点。所以，这有助于我们正确看待当前形势。如果有人说一切都结束了，都是假的，那今天的情况并不支持这种说法。这种下跌趋势会持续吗？我们拭目以待。但对于那些试图提出这种宏观论断，并用他们一整年都在说的“人工智能不真实”的论点来佐证的人，我认为在今天这样的日子里，这种说法很容易被接受，因为大家都很恐慌。但我怀疑这种说法是否真的有道理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I just want to say before we get into it, like the nuances of the intraday moves in the market. By the way, we're still above where we were last Friday when we had a real draw down. So, I know today is ugly for a lot of people just because of the intensity and the velocity of the draw down, but we are not anywhere near the October 17th lows and not anywhere near last Friday's lows. And so, it just helps to put into context like, hey, if we're talking about everything's over, it's all fake. That's not what we're seeing today. Is that trend going to continue? We'll see if that plays out. But for those trying to make that macro claim and then use arguments that they've been making for the whole year, which is that AI isn't real. Again, I think on a day like this, it's easy to make that claim because obviously everyone's scared. I don't know if that claim necessarily has a lot of merit to it.</p>
</details>

### 抛售的三大核心原因

那么今天到底发生了什么？为什么情况这么糟糕？另外，请在聊天区告诉我们，今天是否有人抄底了任何东西。我认为有三件事正在发生。

第一，市场原本期待今天能看到**CPI**（Consumer Price Index: 消费者价格指数，衡量一篮子消费品和服务价格变化的指标）数据，但白宫表示不会公布。数据的缺失引发了问题。总的来说，市场担心白宫可能害怕公布某些类型的数据。顺便说一下，特朗普总统今天就寄养问题与梅拉尼娅签署了一项行政命令，但他没有接受任何提问。这种不接受提问的做法可能也让市场认为，他真的不想面对媒体，也许有很多原因，但这种行为本身以及缺乏透明度正在伤害市场。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What is happening today? What is going on and why is it so bad? Also, please put in the chat if anyone bought the dip on anything today and we'll see if people took advantage of this dip. I think there's three things that are going on. Number one, the market did want CPI data today. The White House said it's not going to happen. So, a lack of data is causing issues. And in general, the market is scared that there's certain types of data that the White House might be afraid to show. President Trump, by the way, he had some executive order around foster care with Melania. He did not take any questions and the lack of taking questions kind of also probably is making the market think this guy really doesn't want to address the media and maybe there's a lot of reasons for that, but that in and of itself and the lack of transparency is hurting the market.</p>
</details>

第二，Verizon宣布裁员15000人，占其员工总数的15%。这绝对不是利好消息，是劳动力市场疲软的又一力证。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Number two, for those that didn't see the headline, Verizon announced 15,000 layoffs. That's 15% of their workforce. Not bullish. Definitely an argument around the labor market weakening, which goes to my third point.</p>
</details>

第三点与第二点有些矛盾，但又相互关联。在过去40小时内，有三位不同的美联储主席站出来表示，他们更担心通货膨胀，而不是劳动力市场。紧接着，Verizon就宣布裁员15000人。这似乎在说，也许他们应该更担心劳动力市场。尤其是在不到三周前的联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）会议上，我们都一起直播观看了鲍威尔的讲话，他说：“我们更担心劳动力市场的下行风险，而不是通胀的上行风险。” 感觉就像在48小时内，整个论调都变了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's contrary to my third point, but nonetheless, it segues into that. You had three different Fed presidents come out over the past 40 hours and say they are more concerned about inflation than the labor market. Then you have Verizon saying, "Let's do 15,000 layoffs." Meaning, maybe I think they should be more concerned about the labor market. Especially when Powell less than three weeks ago at the FOMC meeting. All of us were watching it together live said, "We are more concerned about the downside risk to the labor market versus the upside risk to inflation." It's almost like in 48 hours that entire thesis has changed.</p>
</details>

这才是市场抛售的真正主要原因。是的，缺乏透明度不好，裁员不好，对人工智能**资本支出**（Capital Expenditure: 指公司用于购买、维护或升级实物资产的资金，简称Capex）的潜在担忧也不好。但真正的原因是，12月降息的概率现在已经降到了51.6%。今天早上还是55%，昨天是65%，一周前是75%，再往前两周基本是100%。所以，我们从几乎板上钉钉的12月降息，一路降到了几乎是抛硬币的概率。当你有50-50的机会时，市场几乎不可能对未来走向有任何明确的预期，这也会让市场变得非常恐慌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that really is the big reason for why I think the market's selling off. Yes, lack of transparency is bad. The layoffs are bad. Potential fears on AI capex spend is bad. But the real reason is that the probabilities for a rate cut have now gone to 51.6%. In the morning it was at 55. And yesterday it was at 65. A week ago it was at 75. And two weeks before that it was basically at 100. So you went from basically a guaranteed December rate cut all the way down to a coin toss. And you know, when you have a 50-50 chance, it makes it almost impossible to sort of get the market to have any level of clarity on what's going to happen. And that gets the market to also be very scared.</p>
</details>

我认为这些因素共同导致了我们今天看到的痛苦局面。这次下跌没有一个特定的原因，不像中美贸易政策恶化，也没有特朗普的推文引发市场动荡，而是这种数据的缺失，以及我们可能在12月得不到降息的预期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I think those are the culminations of reasons for why we're seeing the type of pain that we're seeing. There's not sort of one specific reason for this draw down, but a 2% red day with no China trade policy going south, no Trump tweet that's triggering the market, but rather this lack of data. I think that's kind of the core reason along with the idea that we're not going to get a rate or that we potentially might not get a rate cut in December.</p>
</details>

### 政府停摆闹剧与市场反应

昨晚政府停摆结束了，但真正让包括我在内的很多人感到困惑的是：等等，上周五我们的点位比今天还低。周五我们几乎到了659点，然后在东部时间下午2:40，我想我们都记得看到Politico报道说“民主党准备结束停摆”，然后市场瞬间拉升，收盘时我们收绿在672点，这是一个盘中2%的完全逆转。所以我们都觉得，“哦，太好了”，原来政府停摆是市场担心的核心原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, the shutdown did end last night and the thing that really whipsaws people including myself is wait a second on Friday we were lower than where we are today. We were at almost 6:59 on Friday and then at 2:40 p.m. Eastern on Friday I think all of us remember seeing it. Politico says Democrats ready to end shutdown. Boom. We end green. We ended at 672. It was a full 2% intraday reversal. So all of us were like, "Oh, cool." So the shutdown was kind of the core reason that the market was scared.</p>
</details>

然而，当政府停摆真的结束后，我们却失去了那之后的所有涨幅。当然，我们现在在671点，非常接近周五的672点，所以我们只是失去了过去几天的涨幅。这意味着情况其实没有人们想象的那么糟，尽管一天下跌2%确实很难看。但重点是，政府停摆结束的消息并没有真正让市场变得更愿意承担风险。随着停摆的结束，由于围绕新闻动态缺乏明确性，市场反而变得更加避险。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Then we actually end the shutdown and we lose everything that we've gotten since then. Now granted, we are at 671, which is very close to 672, which is where we were on Friday. So we're losing what we got over the past couple days. Meaning it's really not as bad as people think, although it's obviously ugly to have a 2% down day. But the point is those headlines of the shutdown didn't actually materialize in terms of the market being more risk on. With the shutdown ending, it's almost like the market got more risk off because of the lack of clarity around news.</p>
</details>

我同意，隐瞒经济数据就等于承认数据不好，即使政府已经重新开放，这我认为是最大的恐惧之一。然后Verizon裁员的消息出来，对于一个本就对劳动力市场状况缺乏明确性的市场来说，显然不是什么令人兴奋的消息。所以，情况很糟糕。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And yes, I agree. Hiding the economic data is admitting it's not good, even if the government is open, which is, I think, one of the biggest fears. And then that Verizon headline coming out is obviously not exciting to the market that already doesn't have a lack of clarity around what's going on in terms of the labor market. So, it's ugly. It's ugly.</p>
</details>

但这是否意味着一切都结束了？我仍然很难这么说。你可以提出看空的理由，但考虑到围绕盈利的更广泛基本面并未改变，我认为你也可以提出一个相当有力的看多理由。这些基本面会改变吗？当然，任何事情都可能改变，只是我们现在还没有看到。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Does that mean everything is over? Again, I just struggle to say that. You can make a bare case. I think you can also make a pretty stringent bull case given the sort of broader fundamentals around earnings have not changed. Could they change? Of course, anything can change. It's just we're not seeing that right now.</p>
</details>

不过我确实认为，一旦白宫昨天下午说我们不会得到数据，我们就注定会迎来某种程度的抛售。当他们开始指责民主党导致数据无法公布时，我想市场就已经意识到，“好吧，数据不好，劳动力市场不好，我们可能需要规避一些风险。” 现在，风险规避的程度是否像我们今天看到的这么严重？这是否合理？我不知道。这会毁掉“圣诞老人行情”吗？我也不知道。但直觉告诉我，情况不必像市场想象的那么糟糕。尤其是一些公司的估值被压缩，但它们的盈利前景并没有被完全重估，因为很多公司的盈利一直都很好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I do think though we were going to get some type of selloff today as soon as the White House said like and they said this like yesterday afternoon that we're not going to get data. I mean, as soon as they started blaming the Democrats for not getting data, yada yada, I think that's when the market was like, "Okay, the data is not good. Labor market's not good and we probably have to be a little bit risk-off." Now, is it as risk-off as what we're seeing today? Is that justified? I don't know. Does that ruin the Santa Claus rally? I don't know. But gut tells me it doesn't have to be as bad as kind of how the market is thinking. Especially because some of these names, you're having valuations compressed, but you're not seeing a full rerating of their earnings picture given a lot of their earnings have been pretty good.</p>
</details>

### 资金流向与市场情绪

今天几乎无处可藏。耐克（Nike）提供了一点绿色，礼来（Eli Lilly）也保持了上涨。资金再次轮动到医疗保健板块，这并非最悲观的信号。思科（Cisco）今天也表现坚挺，上涨了4.7%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Very little places to hide. You had Nike today that gave you a little bit of green. Lily, did we go green? Lily holding green on the day. That rotation into healthcare again is not the most bearish to see. Cisco actually holding up today up 4.7%.</p>
</details>

与此同时，比特币的下跌对风险偏好情绪没有帮助。顺便说一句，货币市场基金今天并没有太大变动，过去一周仅增加了18亿美元，而上周是1160亿美元。所以你可以想象，很多打算把钱投入货币市场基金的人在两周前就已经行动了，这周增量不大。那10亿美元可能只是很多已存入的货币市场基金资产产生的利息。但场外仍有7.54万亿美元的资金，这又回到了看多的论点：一旦利率下降，这些资金将等待配置到那些真正在增长的资产中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Bitcoin going down is not helping the bull case for risk on at the moment. By the way, money market funds actually not that big of a deal today. It only increased by 1.8 billion over the past week. Last week it was 116 billion. So you could probably imagine that a lot of people that were going to put money into money market funds did it two weeks ago and this week you didn't get that much of an increase. That one billion is probably just interest on a lot of the money market fund assets that are already there. But 7.54 trillion on the sidelines again going to that bullcase of as rates come down money is going to be waiting to get allocated into assets that are actually growing.</p>
</details>

这些公司在创造真实的盈利吗？答案是肯定的。降息会来吗？答案是没人知道，而且美联储过去几天的评论让这个问题变得更加难以预测。这就是我认为正在发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Are the companies producing real earnings? The answer to that question is yes. Are rate cuts coming down? The answer to that question is no one knows and the Fed made it a lot more difficult to find out based on the comments over the past couple days. That's kind of what I think is happening. That is what I think is happening now.</p>
</details>

### 盘后财报与13F文件披露

盘后还有财报发布，我们会讨论一下。另外，今天我们会拿到**13F**（Form 13F: 美国证券交易委员会要求机构投资者披露其持股情况的季度报告）文件。Chris大概二三十分钟后会上线，届时我们会听听他的看法。如果我没记错的话，我们今天应该会收到13F和13G文件。我想已经有一些文件陆续出来了，所以我们将能够追踪一些大型基金的动向。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We do have earnings after the bell, so we'll talk about those earnings. I think we're getting these 13Fs today, guys. Chris will be on in like 20 30 minutes and then we'll get his perspective. But we should be getting 13Fs and 13Gs if I'm not wrong today. I think we're already getting a couple that are coming in and so we'll be able to track what some of these larger funds have been doing.</p>
</details>

不过，在今天这样的日子里公布财报确实很艰难。New Bank和Applied Materials将公布他们的财报。另外，Tom Lee将SoFi加入了他的Granny Shots ETF，他购买了价值9800万美元的SoFi股票。所以SoFi现在正式成为一只Granny Shot。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, but it is a tough day to report on earnings and New Bank and AAT will be reporting their earnings today. Also, in terms of SoFi, uh Tom Lee added SoFi to the Granny Shots ETF. So, SoFi is now a Granny Shot. $98 million of SoFi he bought. So, SoFi is now an official Granny Shot.</p>
</details>

今天市场确实有很多恐慌情绪。如果你刷一下推特，会发现有大量的人将今天比作历史上最糟糕的一天，说这是顶部，说这就像互联网泡沫破裂一样。Michael Burry一周前关闭了他的基金，所以很多人在猜测，他关闭基金究竟是市场顶部的信号，还是底部的信号。但我确实认为，现在市场存在着极度的恐惧，这可能导致了今天的大量抛售。今天可能有很多追加保证金的通知，因为标普500指数下跌了2%，个股下跌了5%到10%，这会触发追加保证金，并可能加剧了我们今天看到的痛苦程度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I do think there was definitely a lot of panic throughout the day. If you just scroll Twitter, the amount of people making comparisons to this is the worst day in history and this is the top and this is like how the dot com bubble ends. Michael Burry did shut down his fund a week ago. So, a lot of people are saying is, you know, him shutting down his fund either as the top or it could be the bottom. But, I do think there's an intense level of fear that's out there and it probably caused a ton of selling today. Probably had a ton of margin calls come in today as you know S&P down 2% and stocks down 5 to 10% that'll create a margin call and that likely increased the level of pain that we saw today.</p>
</details>

### 盘后财报速览

Applied Materials的财报出来了，营收超出预期2%，每股收益（EPS）超出预期3%。营收为68亿美元，高于预期的66.7亿美元；EPS为2.17美元，高于预期的2.10美元。不过，营收同比下降3%，EPS同比下降6%。其股票代码为AMAT，盘后又下跌了1%。

<details>

<p class="english-text">All right, David Tepper, let's see what he did. He sold 7% or sorry 9% of Baba. Sold 7% of Amazon. Added 9% to Nvidia. This is all Q3. Ended September 30th. He sold 8% of his Google. He added 3% to Taiwan Semi. Sold 7% of Meta. Sold 7% of Microsoft. He bought AMD. Wow. He bought AMD. 950,000 shares of AMD. He bought Fiserv. He bought American Airlines, 9.2 million shares of American Airlines, and he added 255% to Qualcomm.</p>
</details>

他还买入了一堆区域性银行，包括Truist、KeyCorp、Citizens Financial、Comerica、Zions和Western Alliance。这表明他正在押注区域性银行，并看空人们尖叫的所谓信贷危机。总的来说，这是一个相当看涨的13F报告。他正在买入人工智能股，减持了一些其他头寸，这是合理的。他买入航空公司，说明他在押注消费者。

<p class="english-text">He bought Truist. David Tepper buys Truist. That's a regional bank. He bought Keycorp, Citizens Financial, and Comerica. I think that's another bank. So, he bought a bunch of regionals. Then, he bought Owens Corning. I don't know what that is. And he bought Zions and Western Alliance. He bought all the regionals. So he's buying regionals. This is a rather bullish 13F. I mean, he's buying AI. He's trimming some of his other positions, which is reasonable. He's buying airlines, so he's betting on the consumer. He bought 9 million shares of American Airlines. You don't do that if you think the consumer is in trouble. And then he bought a bunch of regional banks, which means he's calling BS on the whole credit crisis that people were screaming about in the regionals.</p>

Palantir, they added 107,000 of Palantir. Wow. And then let's go to reduced. Maybe we'll see a reduction for Nvidia. Up four million shares of Nvidia. 4.7. That's not a That's a 65% reduction. And Meta, they sold 390,000. So, they have 400,000 shares of Meta left and 2.5 million shares of Nvidia. But that is a decent chunk. 48% Meta stake they sold and then 65% Nvidia stake that they sold.</p>

霍华德·马克斯（Howard Marks）的Oaktree也公布了持仓。他增持了Grab（约100万股），并新建仓了New Bank（450万股）。他还增持了70%的C Limited。这表明他持续看好东南亚市场，并且正在向国际市场扩张。

### 总结与展望

总而言之，尽管今天市场情绪悲观，但机构投资者的动向显示出复杂的图景：有人在人工智能和区域性银行中寻找机会，有人则在大型科技股上获利了结，还有人将目光投向了国际市场。这再次印证了市场的核心矛盾：一方面是宏观层面的不确定性（数据缺失、美联储政策摇摆），另一方面是微观层面（企业盈利、AI趋势）的韧性。

<p class="english-text">I do not think what we're seeing in 2025, this 2% red day on a 14% green S&P 500 year, is the beginning of a.com bubble. Maybe I'm wrong about it, and if I'm wrong, I'll be publicly wrong. I just I really don't see that as the underlying reason. I think it was a sucky day on a week where we didn't have any jobs data where the government reopened but they reopened with a condition to shut down again in January which the market's also just like all right what are we supposed to do with this and you have headlines like Verizon's laying off 15,000. When you get those types of headlines on a day like this it obviously creates pain but I don't think that's enough to deny sort of the structural factors of this bull market.</p>

从心理健康的角度来看，有两点需要记住。第一，没有痛苦就没有收获。如果你今年大幅跑赢标普500指数，那是因为你承担了相应的风险，尤其是在科技股中，波动是常态。第二，要回归根本，问问自己是否仍然相信这个牛市的两个结构性基础：人工智能革命和美联储的宽松政策。我认为这两个基础都没有改变。人工智能的叙事可能有波折，但趋势未变；美联储即使12月不降息，明年也可能采取更激进的宽松政策。

<p class="english-text">From a mental health perspective, I say this all the time when we have days like this. Number one, no pain, no gains. Like if you are up a lot this year, if you're healthily beating the S&P 500, you are up for a reason. And part of the reason is that you're probably inside of names that have vastly outperformed. You don't get that type of out performance, particularly in technology stocks, without the draw downs. And then number two is just to remember that at the end of the day, do you believe in the two structural fundamental foundations of this bull market, which is the AI trade, which is increasing margins, efficiency, capex, etc., and Fed easing. I don't think the thesis has changed on those two, no matter how much the Fed says they're not going to cut in December. Okay, maybe they don't cut in December, but you're going to be cutting aggressively next year regardless with or without Powell. And then I definitely don't think there's a crack in the AI trade.</p>
