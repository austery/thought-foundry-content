### 互联网的乌托邦愿景与现实

**Joe**: 大家好，欢迎收听**OddLots**播客的又一期节目。我是**Joe Weisenthal**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Hello and welcome to another episode of the OddLocks podcast. I'm Joe Weisenthal.

</details>

**Tracy**: 我是**Tracy Aloway**。Joe，你还记得90年代末互联网刚兴起的时候，人们都觉得它会带来自由主义和民主的乌托邦吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: And I'm Tracy Aloway. Tracy, remember how like in the late 90s like the internet was starting to become a thing and [laughter] people thought it would bring like liberalism and democracy utopia.

</details>

**Joe**: 我完全相信那个说法。人们现在回过头来看，觉得我们当时太天真了，但我不怪他们。我想我也相信了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: I totally bought into that. Like I I you know people look back at that and like oh they were naive. Like I don't blame them. Like I think I bought into that too.

</details>

**Tracy**: 我觉得90年代中期那会儿的互联网文化确实很纯粹，你可以去每个人的小博客看看，大家大多都在聊自己的爱好之类的。至少我当时的体验是这样。可能也因为我那时还在读中学。但它看起来非常纯真。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: I mean there was something very wholesome about the sort of mid9s internet culture where you could go to everyone's like little individual blog and people were mostly talking about their hobbies and things like that. or at least that was my experience of it. Probably colored by the fact that I was in middle school at the time. But it seemed very innocent.

</details>

**Joe**: 它非常酷，非常去中心化。对吧？而现在，我们把互联网和少数科技寡头联系在一起，他们控制着互联网内部的各种“王国”，比如**Meta**王国或**Amazon**王国等等。但那时它是非常去中心化的。每个人都有自己的小网站，拼凑在一起等等。我完全相信那个想法。我当时就觉得：“哦，我们都会互相交流，我们会把事情解决，威权政府绝不可能控制它，我们最终会实现民主的真正承诺等等。”我完全相信了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: It was very cool. It was very decentralized. Right. So now we associate the internet with a handful of tech oligarchs that control various kingdoms maybe you could even say within the internet whether it's the Meta Kingdom or the Amazon kingdom or whatever. But it was very decentralized. Everyone had their own little sites cobbled together and so forth. And I totally bought that idea. I was just like, "Oh, we're all going to talk to each other. We're going to work things out and there's no way that authoritarian governments could ever control this and we'll finally realize the true promise of democracy and all that stuff. I totally bought into it.

</details>

**Tracy**: 快进到2026年。你现在会如何描述互联网？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Fast forward to 2026. How would you describe the internet now?

</details>

**Joe**: 我脑海中总是浮现的一个词，虽然有很多词，就是这种纯粹的部落主义和各个层面的冲突，对吧？民族主义、种族主义、偏执、反犹太主义、性别歧视等等。它就是被这些东西撕裂了。它充满了冲突等等。它高度中心化。所有那些乌托邦式的承诺，嗯，并没有真正实现。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: I mean the word that always comes to my mind and there are many words is just this sort of like sheer like sort of tribalism and conflictualism on every level, right? nationalism, racism, bigotry, anti-semitism, sexism, etc. This is it's just like riven with that. It's riven with conflict and so forth. It's heavily centralized. All of the sort of utopian promise. I'm like, um, didn't really pan out that way.

</details>

**Tracy**: 我会说“粪坑”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: I would say cesspool.

</details>

**Joe**: “粪坑”。那也是个好词。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Cespool. That's a good one, too.

</details>

**Tracy**: 现在你必须非常非常努力才能找到互联网上那些好的、有用的角落。我不是说它们不存在，但我们偏离了互联网最初的乌托邦设想，这很有趣。另一件事正在发生，我们录制这期节目是在1月27日。有趣的是，我们开始更多地讨论平台的力量。所以上周末，有一些指控称**TikTok**正在审查明尼阿波利斯的视频或明尼阿波利斯枪击案的视频。这正好是在新所有权接管平台之后发生的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: You have to try really, really hard nowadays to find like good and useful corners of the internet. And I'm not saying that they're not out there, but it is interesting how far we've deviated from that initial utopian pre premise of the internet. The other thing that's happening, we're recording this on, let's see, January 27th. What's interesting is that we're starting to have even more discussion about the power of the platform. So over the weekend, there have been some allegations that Tik Tok, for instance, is censoring Minneapolis video or video of the Minneapolis shooting. And that's just after the new ownership

</details>

**Joe**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Yeah.

</details>

**Tracy**: 接管了平台，对吧？所以他们剥离了美国业务，现在它有了所有这些新所有者，人们开始讨论，嗯，也许他们在审查，或者即使他们没有直接审查一些内容，也许算法正在影响人们看到什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: took control of the platform, right? So they spun off the US business and now it has all these new owners and people are starting to talk about well maybe they're censoring or even if they're not directly censoring some stuff, maybe the algorithm is influencing what people see.

</details>

**Joe**: 完全正确。在我们深入讨论之前，还有另一个维度，我认为这非常重要，那就是互联网正在地理上分裂。对吧？所以，我们早就知道，当然，人们谈论中国的防火墙和中国互联网，但不仅仅是中国，对吧？我们看到英国正在制定自己的规则，澳大利亚也在制定自己的规则。几年前我们还看到了巴西暂时禁用**Twitter**等等。所以，数字平台和国家主权之间存在着各种交织。我确实在某种程度上相信，世界各地的许多领导人都在嫉妒地看着中国似乎更受控制的互联网，对吧？他们说：“哦，我们很想对我们的‘城市广场’等拥有这种程度的控制。”而且，你知道，有些国家有第一修正案，这使得事情非常棘手等等。但感觉互联网的许多方面都没有按预期发展，人们想限制人们能看到什么。我们想收紧算法。我们想遏制某些言论等等。我认为这将是我们这个时代最大的故事之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Totally. And then there's one other dimension before we get into the conversation that I think is very important here, which is that the internet is splintering geographically. Right. So, we've known for a long time, of course, people talk about the firewall in China and the Chinese internet, but it's not just China, right? We see the UK establishing its own rules, and we see Australia establishing its own rules. We saw the thing a couple years ago with Brazil temporarily banning Twitter, etc. And so, there's all these sort of intermingling of digital platforms and national sovereignty. And I really do believe to some extent that a lot of the leaders around the world are looking at China in a seemingly more controlled internet like with jealousy, right? And they're saying, "Oh, we would love to like have this level of control over our sort of town square, etc." And you know, some countries have the first amendment, so that makes it very tough, etc. But it really feels like there are so many aspects of um the internet that are sort of not panning out, and people like we want to constrict what people can see. We want to tighten the algorithms. We want to curb some kind of discourse, etc. And I think this is going to be one of the biggest stories of our time.

</details>

**Tracy**: 是的。具体到中国，仍然有一个大问题，那就是互联网审查是否能起到一种安全阀的作用，让人们发泄一些情绪，但又不足以威胁到那里的政权，或者它是否真的是一种社会变革的工具，因为人们在某种程度上被允许说一些话。我认为这个问题仍然悬而未决。嗯，我很高兴地说，我们确实请到了一位完美的嘉宾，她写了一本关于中国互联网的精彩新书。我们将与**Yeling Louu**交谈。她是新书《**墙舞者**》的作者。非常感谢你来到**OddLots**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Yeah. With China specifically, there's still a big question which is whether or not the censorship of the internet basically allows it to act as a sort of like safety valve that lets people, you know, blow off some steam but not enough steam to actually threaten the regime over there or whether it's actually a tool or could be a tool of social change because people are to some extent allowed to say some stuff. I think that question is like still kind of unanswered. Well, I'm very excited to say we really do have the perfect guest, someone who has written a fascinating new book all about the Chinese internet. We're going to be speaking with Yeling Louu. She is the author of the new book, The Wall Dancers. Thank you so much for coming on OddLots.

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 非常感谢邀请我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: Thanks so much for having me.

### 《墙舞者》：个体视角下的中国互联网

**Joe**: 这本书是关于什么的？为什么叫《**墙舞者**》？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: What is this book and why is it called The Wall Dancers?

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 是的。所以“墙舞者”这个词来源于中文的一个说法，叫做“戴着镣铐跳舞”，它最初在21世纪初被记者用来形容在国家限制下写作和报道的含义，但后来慢慢地像病毒一样传播开来，被软件工程师、音乐家、科幻作家使用。这个“舞蹈”的概念真的引起了我的共鸣，因为它抓住了这个想法：

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: Yeah. So the wall dancers, the phrase comes from this term in Chinese which is called dancing in shackles and it was first used in the early 2000s by journalists to describe what it means to like write and report under state constraints but slowly became viral as a term that was used by I've seen like software engineers use it, musicians use it, science fiction writers use it and it really resonated with me this idea of the dance because it captured

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 在中国社会生活和航行是一种舞蹈。它是国家与社会之间动态的推拉。这意味着生活在一个一方面充满创新，另一方面又受到严格限制的地方。我开始看到这种舞蹈在互联网上最具活力，也就是我们所知的“**防火墙**”背后的空间。而那些我认为非常擅长驾驭这个领域的人，我开始认识并称他们为“舞者”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: This idea that to live and navigate Chinese society is a dance. It's this dynamic push and pull between state and society. It means living in this place that's on one hand rich with innovation and yet on the other hand rigidly constrained. And I came to see that this dance was most dynamic on the internet, what we know is the space behind the great firewall. And the people that I thought were really good and adept at navigating this terrain, I came to know them and call them dancers.

</details>

**Tracy**: 所以这是你书中最有趣的地方，也是我们想和你谈谈的原因。你通过个体的视角讲述了中国互联网的故事，而不是通过主导这个领域的互联网平台，甚至不是从以国家为中心的角度。通过采访或跟踪个体，你得到了什么，而不是采取其他方法？你知道，市面上有很多关于**微博**崛起之类的书。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: So this was the really interesting thing about your book and the reason we wanted to talk to you. You tell this story of the Chinese internet through the perspective of individuals rather than say the internet platforms that have come to dominate the space or even from a sort of state ccentric point of view. What do you get out of interviewing or following individuals versus taking that other approach which you know there are plenty of books out there about the rise of waybo and stuff like that?

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 我认为我选择这种方式的主要原因是，如果你看西方新闻头条或关于中国和中国技术的普遍头条，它几乎总是属于两种二元对立之一。它被简化为非常简单的术语。一种是中国，那个正在建造人形机器人和高速铁路的庞大经济巨头，一个充满无限机遇的地方。然后是技术威权主义的压迫性政权，那里的人们没有自己的能动性。我认为这里的大问题是，中国互联网总是通过美国国家安全和经济利益的视角来构建和看待的。我希望迫使人们摆脱这些陈词滥调。而要看到中国和中国互联网的所有复杂性和矛盾，就必须通过人，通过个体生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: I think my main the main reason behind this choice was if you look at western news headlines or headlines in general about China and Chinese technology it almost always falls under one of two binaries. It's reduced to very simple terms. One is China, the kind of sprawling economic juggernaut that's building humanoids and highspeed rail and it's place of boundless opportunity. And then you have the like techno athoritarian oppressive regime where mindless people have no agency of their own. And I think the big issue here is that the Chinese internet is always framed through and seen through the lens of American national security and economic interests. And I wanted to force people out of these tropes. And the way to see kind of China and the Chinese internet in all its complexity and contradictions is through people and through individual lives.

</details>

**Joe**: 是的。你通过讲述一个男同性恋者的故事开始这本书，他能够通过互联网建立社群，找到志同道合的人，最终在当时受到极端压制、同性恋可能非法的时期找到归属。你知道，这在中国和美国似乎都是很多人对互联网寄予厚望的原因。人们认为，哦，人们将能够在这些数字空间中找到社群、志同道合的个体，并获得认可。我想在很多情况下，这确实发生了。但有趣的是，在全球背景和中国特定背景下，都有类似的故事被讲述，都有类似的希望。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Yeah. You start the book by telling the story of a gay man who is able through the internet to build community, find people eventually at a time when of course there was extreme repression. Homosexuality was I think illegal at the time. You know, again, this seems both in China and the US what probably a lot of people were very hopeful for with the internet. This idea that oh, people are going to be able to find community like-minded individuals, find acceptance in these digital spaces. And I suppose in many cases since this happened, but it is interesting how in both the global context and the Chinese specific context, there were similar stories being told. There were similar hopes.

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 确实如此。我至少把中国互联网的故事看作是一场浪漫。但我意识到，正如你之前讨论的，全球互联网的故事也是一场浪漫。万维网的故事也是一场浪漫。我当然也相信了你所相信的叙事。我以为我们正沿着一个目的论的弧线走向自由化。我想很多人都相信了这种叙事。这种想法是，你知道，中国互联网尽管**防火墙**很早就存在，但它会推动人们走向更大的开放、更大的自由、更大的连接，并且会一直这样发展下去。所以请告诉我们，中国互联网上允许什么，不允许什么，因为正如你所说，它在许多方面比简单的直接审查更微妙。尽管有时它就是直接审查，你不能说某个特定的词，比如“天安门”之类的。我记得，现在我想起来了，在21世纪初我在北京的时候，审查制度非常明显，比如某些网站被直接屏蔽，电视上你看**CNN**的时候，新闻报道到一半突然就黑屏了，或者你收到的报纸上真的有文字被黑笔划掉。但到底什么被允许，什么不被允许呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: Definitely. I I think of the story of the internet in China at least as a romance. But I'm realizing, you know, as you discussed earlier, the story of the global internet was also a romance. The story of the worldwide web was also a romance. I certainly bought into the narrative that you bought into. I thought we were on this like teological arc towards liberalization. And I think a lot of people bought into that narrative. this idea that you know the Chinese internet despite the fact that the firewall existed very early was going to push people towards greater openness, greater freedom, greater connection and it would just keep going on from there and there. So talk to us about what is and isn't allowed on the Chinese internet then because as you say it's more nuanced than just like outright censorship in many ways. Although sometimes it is just outright censorship and you can't say a specific word like tennmen or something like that. And I remember actually now that I'm thinking about it in the early 2000s when I was in Beijing like the censorship was very obvious like certain sites were just outright blocked on TV. You'd be watching CNN and suddenly it would go black during a news story or you get newspapers delivered to you that had literally physical like

</details>

**Tracy**: 文字被黑笔划掉。但到底什么被允许，什么不被允许呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: sentences crossed out with a black marker. But what is and isn't allowed.

</details>

### 审查的模糊性与自我审查

**Yeling Louu**: 我首先要说的是，如果我能非常准确地回答这个问题，[笑声]我现在就会是一个非常富有的人了。我认为原因在于，审查生态系统正是靠模糊性而繁荣发展的，对吧？正是因为它模糊，正是因为它没有红线，才使得它能如此有效地运作。我要说的是，在过去的几十年里，它发生了相当大的变化，特别是自从你上次去那里之后，Tracy。所以，你知道，以前，我会说界限要清晰得多。很多人会说：“没有天安门，没有西藏，没有台湾。”他们称之为“三个T”。所以当时的审查制度主要是针对反对政府的异议、对政府的批评，但最重要的是任何可能引发集体行动的事情。所以，如果有关于抗议的消息，或者人们聚集的消息，或者任何可能演变成更大规模、将人们聚集到现实“城市广场”的不安，那就会被审查。但多年来，我敢说，特别是在2010年代中期，它也开始涵盖任何偏离党意识形态议程的内容。所以这就是为什么你会看到声明说，我们不希望不健康的婚姻价值观出现在互联网上。比如，我们不希望，我想最近在2021年，[ __ ]男孩被列入了需要从互联网上删除的内容。不许有娘娘腔。我能想象就像树屋上画着一个手绘的牌子一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: I will start off by saying that if I could answer that question really accurately, [laughter] I would be a very rich woman right now. I think the reason being like the censorship ecosystem thrives off vagueness, right? the fact that it's vague, the fact that there are no red lines is what allows it to function so effectively. I will say that it's changed quite dramatically over the last few decades, especially since you were last there, Tracy. So, you know, back in the day, I would say the lines were much clearer. Uh, a lot of people would say things like, "No tenan men, no Tibet, no Taiwan." They would call them the three T's. So censorship back then was very much allowed about a disscent against the government, criticism of the government, but most importantly anything that would provoke collective action. So if there was, you know, news of a protest or news of people gathering or any type of unease that might boil into something bigger and bring people together into a physical town square that got censored. But over the years, I would say particularly in the mid210s, that's come to encompass also anything that veers from the party's ideological agenda. So this is where you have statements coming out saying we don't want unhealthy marital values appearing on the internet. Like we don't want I think recently in 2021, [ __ ] boys got added to things that got needed to be taken down the internet. No sissies allowed. I'm imagining like a handdrawn sign on a treehouse or something.

</details>

**Joe**: 是的。你知道，所有属于其意识形态议程的东西现在都被清除了。我还要补充一点，就是过度炫富。你知道，这是以前互联网上随处可见的新现象。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Yeah. And you know like everything that comes you know everything that's part of its ideological agenda is now scrubbed off. And another thing that I add on there is like the excessive flaunting of wealth. You know that's something that's new that used to be all over the internet back in the day.

</details>

**Tracy**: 我们这里也需要这个。这让人们很抓狂，因为他们看**Instagram**，我记得在疫情期间，我待在家里，看到所有这些人到处飞来飞去。我变得非常不满。那么，对政府的批评，但不是从意识形态角度出发的呢？因为有时你会读到这样的故事，比如有人被火车或汽车撞了，也许警察没有进行调查，然后你会看到很大的骚动。请告诉我们什么被允许，以及**防火墙**的管理者，或者说规则的管理者，不是**防火墙**本身，是如何看待这些事件的，比如对政府处理事情的批评。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: We need that here. It's driving people crazy cuz they look on Instagram and I remember being you know during co and I was like in my house and seeing like all these people like flying around. I got very resentful. What about criticisms of the government, but not from an ideological perspective per se? Because sometimes you read a story like someone will have gotten hit by a train or a car and maybe the police like didn't do an investigation, you see this big uproar. talk to us about what's allowed and how they how the managers of the firewall or managers of the rules not the firewall per se think about these incidents like just yeah criticism of government handling of things

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 再次声明，我无法明确地说什么被删除，什么不被删除。我倾向于认为，只要有任何针对地方官员、地方政府的批评，技术上都会受到高度警惕并被删除。但它实际在幕后是如何运作的呢？是某个更高级别的监管机构，比如**中国国家互联网信息办公室**（**CAC**），会发布指令。所以，也许某个县发生了地方腐败，新闻开始泄露，那么那个监管委员会的成员就会写一份指令，说“嘿，淡化这件事，不要让它出现在**微博**上”，然后这份指令就会传达给**微博**的审查员，他们就会开始从新闻源中删除这些内容。或者，情况也可能相反，**微博**的审查员甚至没有收到指令，但他们会主动地，就像一个非常害怕惹老师生气的学生一样，在收到指令之前就去删除这些内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: again like I can't say with you know definitively what's taken down and what's not taken down I would veer on saying that whenever there's any criticism of any kind of local official local government that's technically looked on with great caution and taken down but how it actually works behind the scenes is that some higher level top regulator say the the Chinese cyerspace administration the CIC will write a directive so maybe there's local corruption in some county and news starts spilling out and whoever is part of that regulatory committee will be writing a directive that says hey downplay this let's not have this appear on way that will then get passed on to Wayboa's sensors who then start scrubbing that off their news feed. Or it happens the other way where Waybo's sensors aren't even receiving that directive, but kind of proactively like a student who is really nervous about upsetting their teacher in advance will just go and scrub that off even before receiving that directive.

</details>

**Joe**: 哦，有意思。所以，基本上是自我审查。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Oh, interesting. So, selfcensorship basically.

</details>

**Tracy**: 是的。那么，现在的审查过程有多么劳动密集呢？因为，你知道，我想正如你所说，指令被制定出来，然后有人必须执行它们。但另一方面，现在互联网的很大一部分是由算法控制的，最近还有**AI**。你可以设计一个算法，它总是淡化政治丑闻之类的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Yes. So, how labor intensive is the censorship process nowadays? Because you know I imagine as you said directives get made and someone has to enact them. But on the other hand so much of the internet nowadays is ruled by algos and most recently AI. You could just you know design an algorithm that always downplays political scandal or something like that.

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 我会说，非常劳动密集。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: I would say hugely labor intensive.

</details>

**Joe**: **五毛**大军。他们就是这么叫的，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Armies of Wumau. That's what they're called, right?

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 是的。所以这特指“**50美分大军**”。但那特指的不是国家资助的行动者，也不是国家雇佣的个人，而是那些在发布爱国内容的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: Yeah. So that specifically refers to the 50 C army. UMO, but that specifically refers to not necessarily state sponsored actors or not necessarily state paid individuals, but people who are kind of pumping patriotic content,

</details>

**Tracy**: 业余民族主义者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: hobbyist nationalists.

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 完全正确。完全正确。所以，你知道，**五毛**和你在今天的**X**上看到的一些爱国喷子和“incels”之间，其实并没有太大区别，对吧？那些在**Twitter**上发布亲**特朗普**宣传的人，在多大程度上与**五毛**本质上是相同的？有一种动态叫做“**洪水**”，指的是当“incels”或某个特定的在线群体向新闻源大量发布内容，试图清除他们不希望人们看到的新闻。这种情况在中国一直都在发生。但我认为这与在**微博**或**抖音**等地方工作的实际员工不同，他们每天都在删除网络上的内容。你知道，我为这本书采访了一位**微博**的审查员，他从2011年开始在那里工作，我想他是150名员工之一。这正是**微博**刚成立的时候，他说，你知道，到2020年他已经离开了，当时可能已经有10000名员工了。哇。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: Exactly. Exactly. So, you know, there's actually not too much of a difference between the Wumau and maybe some of the patriotic trolls and incelss that you see on X today, right? To what extent is are some of the people who are posting like proTrump propaganda on Twitter essentially the same as Wumlau? There's this dynamic called flooding which refers to when incelss or a particular group of online individuals are pumping just content onto a news feed to try to get rid of news that they don't want people to look at. And that takes place in China all the time. But I think that's different from actual employees who work at places like Wayool or Doin who are just spending every single day deleting stuff off the web. And you know when I I interviewed actually for the book a sensor for Wayboa and he started working there at in 2011 I think he was one of 150 employees. This was right when Waybo was founded and he said you know by 2020 he had left [music] already. There were probably like 10,000. Wow. Yeah.

</details>

### 中美互联网的相似模式

**Joe**: 我读你的书时，最让我震惊的就是这一点。你知道，你谈论的这些人，他们可能是机器人，可能是受雇的，也可能只是自然而然地被驱使加入一个群体，想要“**灌水**”。但其中一些模式似乎并非中国独有。它们几乎就像是互联网本身固有的，无论官方规则是什么。完全正确。我们无法判断这些是否是本土的、草根的爱国热情，只是被放大了。你知道，当我说这些的时候，这听起来不就像美国互联网上正在发生的事情吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: I mean, this is sort of what I was struck by reading your book, which is that, you know, you talk about these people who are maybe they're bots, maybe they're paid, maybe they're just naturally impelled to join a mob and want to flood something. But some of these patterns do not seem distinct to China. It's almost like they're endemic to the internet itself, regardless of what the official rules are. Absolutely right. We have no sense of whether or not these are kind of homegrown grassroots patriotic flames that are just amplified. And you know when I say that, doesn't that sound very similar to what's taking place on the American internet?

</details>

**Tracy**: 我忘了那个美国**Twitter**网红的名字了，她被认为是**特朗普**的得力助手。你知道我说的是谁吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: I forget the name of that one American Twitter influencer who's kind of been talked about as Trump's right-hand woman. Do you know who I'm talking about?

</details>

**Joe**: **Laura Loomer**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Laura Loomer.

</details>

**Tracy**: 是的。**Laura Loomer**。是不是有点像？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Yes. Laura Loomer. Like isn't there like

</details>

**Joe**: 我本来想说你得更具体一点，因为现在这样的人[笑声]还挺多的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: I was going to say you have to be more specific cuz there's [laughter] quite a few nowadays.

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 但是的，**Laura Loomer**，你知道，当我们读关于她的新闻文章时，总是在问她是否收钱了？她是否没有收钱？你知道，这让我想起了很多中国爱国网红的动态。他们非常真诚地持有他们分享的观点，但通过放大和支持这些观点，他们是否从中获得了好处？既然我们已经提到了**微博**几次，而且你刚才也给我们讲了关于审查员数量的趣闻，他们经历了惊人的增长。我一直不明白**微博**的起源故事，因为我的理解是他们基本上是在审查制度中诞生的。所以当时在**乌鲁木齐**发生了骚乱，我想是这样，然后很多现有的互联网平台要么被压制，要么被完全关闭，然后**微博**的创始人就觉得这是一个机会，他可以进入并创建自己的平台。我一直不明白这种心态。他认为他能做到其他平台未能做到的事情是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: But yeah, Laura Lumra, you know, when we read news articles on her, it's is she being paid out? Is she not being paid out? And you know, that very much reminds me of the dynamic with a lot of Chinese patriotic influencers. Like they very much earnestly hold the views that they're sharing, but is there a cut being taken by amplifying those views and supporting those views? H since we've mentioned Waybo a couple times now and you know you just gave us that anecdote about the number of sensors they had and they have experienced phenomenal growth. One thing I never understood about Waybo is the kind of origins story because my understanding is they were basically born out of censorship. So there was unrest in Arumchi I think it was and so a bunch of existing internet platforms either got you know repressed or taken down completely and then the founder of Waybo was like I know this is an opportunity for me to get in and start my own platform. I never understood that mindset. What was it that he thought he could do that other platforms had failed to do?

</details>

**Joe**: 是的。所以**微博**实际上是“小博客”或“微型博客”的意思，而**微博**是“**新浪微博**”的简称，这是公司的全名。但在2009年之前，老实说，在2011年之前，有很多很多“微型博客”。有几十家公司都在尝试做微型博客平台。所以有一个平台叫**饭否**。嗯，有很多。还有一个平台叫**人人网**，它不是真正的微型博客平台，它有点像中国的**Facebook**，在当时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Yeah. So Wayboy actually means little blog or micro blog and Wayboa is shorthand for Sino Wayboa which is the full company's name but before 2009 honestly before 2011 there were many many ways. There were or there were dozens of companies that were all trying to be micro blogging platforms. So there was a platform called Fanfu. Um there was a whole bunch. There was a platform called Ren Ren which was not really a micro blogging platform. is kind of like a Chinese Facebook so to say back in the day

</details>

**Tracy**: 人人网，对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: people people right

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 完全正确。完全正确。**新浪**的创始人实际上在2009年创立了现在被称为**微博**的平台，他基本上做了所有其他公司都在做的事情，他只是在审查方面做得更好。这才是真正发生的事情，正如你提到的，在2009年**乌鲁木齐**的抗议期间，他只是在清除信息方面做得更好，当时他没有被关闭，而所有其他公司都被关闭了。嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: exactly exactly and the founder of Sinoa actually founded what is now known as waya in 2009 and he did essentially the same thing as all these other companies he just did a better job of censoring that's really what happened as you mentioned during the protests in Arumchi in 2009 he just did a much better job of scrubbing information off the way feed and at the time and didn't get shut down or all of these other companies got shut down. Hm.

</details>

**Joe**: 听你描述很有趣。我们去年3月确实做了一期节目，嘉宾是**Sinica**播客的**Kaiser Kuo**。我们当时谈论了一点中国政策的运作方式，以及这种去中心化、中心化的**KPI**理念，对吧？所以北京会——这当时是在产业政策背景下——北京说我们想要更多的太阳能生产或更多的电动汽车生产，然后所有省级领导人都会根据他们地区的具体情况来理解这意味着什么，然后半自主地工作以满足这一要求。这在某种程度上听起来与审查规则相似，特别是当你描述那种预防性的自我审查时，每个人都在努力找出与更广泛的指令相符的正确水平或方法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: It's interesting hearing you describe we did an episode actually it was last March with Kaiser Quo of the Cynica podcast. We were talking a little bit about how Chinese policym works and this idea of this sort of decentralized centralized like KPIs right? So Beijing will this was in the industrial policy context. Beijing says we want more solar production or more electric vehicle production and then all the provincial leaders figure out what that means in the context of their region and then work quasi autonomously to satisfy that. It sounds similar to some extent with the rules around censorship especially when you describe some of that preemptive self censorship of everyone trying to figure out the right level or approach that is consistent with the broader level mandate.

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 是的。不，这是一个非常好的观点，我肯定会画出这个平行线。你知道，例如，如果他们要发布产业政策，一家科技公司的**CEO**就会非常仔细地阅读这份政策，然后想：“好吧，我们如何将公司的发展方向与这份政策指令的措辞保持一致？”审查制度也是如此，你知道。所以，我采访的一个对象是约会应用**Blued**的**CEO**。如果他们发布一份审查指令，说我们不希望[ __ ]男孩出现在我们的平台上，他就会非常仔细地查看平台，看看我们如何确保我们的应用上没有[ __ ]男孩，对吧？所以，肯定有这种感觉，我不知道你有没有读过《**哈利·波特**》。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: Yeah. No, that's a really good point and definitely a parallel that I would draw. You know, for example, if they were to release industrial policy, a tech company CEO will then like read that policy very carefully and be like, okay, how can we align our company's direction with the rhetoric of this policy directive? The same goes with censorship, you know. So, one of the subjects that I profile is the CEO or was the CEO of this skating dating app, Blude. And so if they release a censorship directive saying we don't want [ __ ] boys on our platform, he's going to go and look very carefully at the platform and see how are we going to make sure there are no [ __ ] boys on our app, right? And so there is definitely this sense of I don't know if you have read Harry Potter.

</details>

**Joe**: 我从来没读过。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: I never did.

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 我读过。你没读过吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: I did. Did you not?

</s Joe>: 我从来没读过。我从来没读过。但**Tracy**会明白，我们99%的听众也会明白。尽管使用这个比喻吧。它会从我头顶飞过。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: I never did. I never did. But Tracy will get it and 99% of our listeners will get it. Feel free to use the analogy. It will go over my head.

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 这个比喻真的让我深有体会。你还记得**Dolores Umbridge**吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: This analogy really hit it home for me. But you remember Dolores Umbridge?

</details>

**Tracy**: 是的。哦，她真令人毛骨悚然。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Yeah. Oh, she was creepy.

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 是的。你还记得她会发布这些法令吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: Yeah. You remember how she would like post these degrees

</details>

**Tracy**: 然后所有这些，她会把它们贴在墙上，然后它们会有点模糊，然后学生们就会吓坏了，手忙脚乱，你知道，像**Malfoy**那样的人会积极地过度解读，[清嗓]我想那基本上就是那种动态。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: and then all of the and she would just post them on the wall and then they would be kind of vague and then students would freak out and scramble and you know people like Malfoy would aggressively over and interpret and [clears throat] that I think that's the dynamic essentially.

</details>

**Joe**: 记住这一点。我认为这有时是一个被低估的观点，但法令中的模糊性是故意的，对吧？这样你就永远不确定什么被允许，什么不被允许，所以你就会开始自我审查，而且，你知道，如果政府想找你的麻烦，他们可以做到，因为规则是故意模糊的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Remember that. I think this is an underappreciated point sometimes, but like the vagueness in the decrees is done on purpose, right? It's so that like you're never really sure what is and isn't allowed and so you do start self-censoring and also, you know, if the government wants to go after you, they can do it because the rule is purposefully vague.

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 是的。这也意味着这些公司都有庞大的审查词汇数据库，这些数据库极其宝贵。它们就像专有资产，你知道，它们就是这样维持公司生存的，对吧？如果你有一个比同行公司更好的关键词数据库，你就有更大的生存机会。所以，就关键词而言，这是中国互联网最引人入胜的事情之一，我想很多人现在都知道了，但你知道，互联网用户在绕过审查方面非常有创意。所以他们总是想出一些代码，其中一些如果你不知道上下文，听起来会非常有趣。比如，是不是有一个“草泥马”或者“泥草马”之类的东西在和螃蟹打架？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: Yeah. And it also means that like each of these companies have these huge keyword databases of censored words and those are extremely valuable. They're like proprietary assets where you know they that is how they keep their company alive essentially, right? It if you have a better keyword database than the company down the road, you're going to have a better chance of surviving. So just on the keywords, this is one of the most fascinating things about the Chinese internet and I think a lot of people know about it at this point, but you know, internet users are very creative in bypassing the sensors. So they're always coming up with codes, some of which sound very funny if you don't know the context. Like isn't there one horse mud horse mud or mudgrass horse or something fighting a crab?

</details>

**Tracy**: 完全正确。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Exactly.

</details>

**Joe**: **小熊维尼**。是的，就是它。**小熊维尼**。好吧。那个会是最明显的。这有点离题，但你认为那种创造力或者说代码词汇，你认为这与中文本身以及许多词语非常字面化，而且有很多同音字的事实有关吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Winnie the Poo. Yeah, there we go. Winnie the Pooh. All right. That one would be the obvious one. This is sort of tangential, but do you think that I guess do you think that kind of creativity or like code wording? Do you think that's related to the Chinese language itself and the fact that a lot of the words are very literal and also you have a lot of homonyms?

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 绝对是。其中很大一部分原因是每个汉字都可以有多种含义。所以，例如，你提到的最著名的一个，早在21世纪初就出现了，就是“**草泥马**”这个概念，对吧？“**草泥马**”在中文里是cǎo ní mǎ，只要你改变声调，它就变成了cào nǐ mā，这基本上就是“你妈”的意思。所以，你知道，它就成了一种讽刺性的集结口号，用来反击那些越界的权威。但它既有趣又双关。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: Definitely. Like a huge part of it is like each character can have multiple meanings. So for example, the most famous one that you mentioned that emerged as early as the early 2000s was this idea of the grass mud horse, right? And so grass mud horse in Chinese is ma and just depending on the tones you shift the tones, it becomes which means basically your mom. And so, you know, it became this like rally cuz ironic rallying cry pushing back against, you know, authorities who are being who are overstepping their bounds. But it's funny and punny at the same time.

</details>

**Tracy**: 我确实认为即使在**Twitter**上，你也能看到某些社群，特别是更极端的那些，他们的深奥交流和代码词汇，但似乎尤其是在非常微妙的同音词盛行的情况下，深奥表达的创造力可能会达到一个全新的水平。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: I do think even like on Twitter, you see certain communities, particular more extremist ones, like you see their esoteric communications and you see their code words, but it does seem like especially with the prevalence of very subtle homonyms etc. the creativity for esoteric expression probably gets taken to a whole new level.

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 确实如此。确实如此。不过，我现在看到一个有趣的动态是，中国互联网上使用的许多术语实际上与美国互联网上使用的许多术语的情绪相呼应。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: Definitely. Definitely. Though an interesting dynamic that I'm now seeing is that a lot of the terms that are being used on the Chinese internet are actually, you know, echoing a lot of the sentiment that of the terms that are being used in the American internet. So more

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 我注意到一个词，它在两地都还没有大规模流行，那就是“**NPC**”这个概念。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: one term that I've noticed come up, it's not hugely viral in either place yet, is this idea of the NPC.

</details>

**Joe**: 哦，是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Oh, yeah.

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 是的。或者说“非玩家角色”。我没有意识到这在两边都有共鸣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: Yeah. Or the non-player character. And I didn't realize this was like resonating on both sides.

</details>

**Joe**: 哦，是的。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Oh yeah. Yeah.

</details>

**Tracy**: 这很有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: That's interesting.

</details>

**Joe**: 你知道那个“大棋局”吗？或者你熟悉那个词吗？或者“3D棋局”之类的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Do you know that one the big chess party or have are you familiar with that term or the 3D chess party or something like that?

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 我不确定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: I'm I'm not sure.

</details>

**Joe**: 有一个我喜欢并开始使用的词，指的是那些对领导层过于辩护的人，他们说的每句话都像是“不不不，你不懂。他们正在下**5D棋**”或者“你不懂”，所以我想那个词是“**大棋局**”之类的。我想我们需要更多地使用它，因为那是个好词。是的，很有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: There's one I like that I saw that I started using which is people who are so defensive of the leadership that every everything they say is like no no you don't get it. They're playing 5D chess or you don't get and so I think they the term was big chess party or something like that. I think we need to we need to start incorporating that more because that's a good one. Yeah, it's a fun one.

</details>

**Tracy**: 但实际上，就这一点而言，跟踪所有不同的暗语或学习新暗语有多难？因为，你知道，一方面，如果你用**小熊维尼**而不是**习近平**之类的词，它可能允许你绕过审查。但另一方面，如果你一直在用暗语交流，我想这意味着有些人根本无法理解信息。它无法与社会上的某个特定群体产生共鸣。那么，这有多难？以及不断跟上所有这些关键词的优缺点是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: But actually on this note, how difficult is it to keep track of all the different code words or to learn the new code words? Because, you know, on the one hand, if you're saying Winnie the Pooh in instead of shiinping or something like that, it allows you to perhaps bypass censorship. But on the other hand, if you're talking in code constantly, I imagine it means some people like just aren't getting the message. It's not resonating with a certain sector of society. So, how difficult is it? And what are the pros and cons of having to keep up with all these keywords constantly?

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 绝对。我的意思是，这非常困难。这只意味着这些词变得越来越晦涩。你知道，我是一个以研究中国互联网为职业的人，我经常会读社交媒体帖子，却完全不知道发生了什么。而且有整个团队。实际上有一个很棒的团队叫做**中国数字时代**，一个非营利组织，他们专门研究这个。完全正确。完全正确。我必须查阅它，因为有时我读到的东西完全不知道它指的是什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: Absolutely. I mean, it's hugely difficult. It just means that these words become more and more obscure. You know, I'm someone who has made a career out of studying the Chinese internet and I'll often read social media posts and have no idea what's going on. And there are entire teams. There's actually this excellent team called China Digital Times, a nonprofit organization that literally studies. Exactly. Exactly. And I have to consult that because sometimes I'm reading stuff and I have no idea what it's referring to.

</details>

**Joe**: 嗯。我想更多地了解，特别是像美国人或国际社会如何更普遍地了解中国互联网上正在发生的事情。但在那之前，我想问一个经常被重复的说法，你在**TikTok**的辩论中经常听到它，它带有一种种族主义、异国情调或东方主义等等，人们会说：“哦，在美国**TikTok**上，都是垃圾、愤怒诱饵和粗俗内容，但在中国的同类平台上，他们却在学习数学、学习拉小提琴，以及所有这些刻板印象的东西。”你能否简单地告诉我们，从日常内容角度来看，抛开政治敏感性不谈，这些平台感觉有多相似或不同？是的，我的意思是，我对这种说法有点纠结，因为一方面它有点美化了——我的意思是，这取决于谁在说这些话，对吧？你不是在美化，就是在向中国互联网投射了很多东西。它更多地揭示了，我想说，美国保守派对他们自己互联网上出现的内容的焦虑和投射，因为中国互联网也充满了各种疯狂的粗俗内容。嗯，这就是我所想的。我的假设是，这种差距被大大夸大了，但我从未消费过中国的**TikTok**版本，也就是原版**TikTok**。所以，我完全不知道这些刻板印象有多真实，或者其他什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Huh. I want to get into more of the sort of like especially like how an American or internationally we might learn more generally about what's going on the Chinese internet. But before we get to that, I want to ask there is this trope or this thing that gets repeated a lot and you heard it a lot in the Tik Tok debates and it's smacks of a certain racism or exoticism or orientalism etc. where people say, "Oh, on American Tik Tok, they're all like it's all a bunch of garbage and rage bait and slob, but on the equivalent in China, it's they're learning mathematics and learning how to play violin and all these sort of stereotypical things." Can you talk to us just a little bit about like how similar dissimilar do these platforms feel from a sort of day-to-day content standpoint setting aside sensitivities about politics? Yeah, I mean I'm like kind of torn about that statement because on one hand it kind of like glorifies I mean it depending on who you're look who's saying those statements, right? You're either glorifying and kind of like projecting a lot onto the Chinese internet. It really reveals more about I would say like American conservative anxiety about what's appearing on their own internet and projections because the Chinese internet is full of like crazy slop too. Well, this is what I'm like, get it. My assumption is that the gap is like massively overstated, but I've never, you know, consumed whatever the Chinese version, the original Tik Tok is. So, I just have no sense like how real these stereotypes are, or whatever.

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 完全正确。就像一个年轻的学生，你知道，在中国，当他们只是在刷手机时，他们不会只看到能帮助他们在学校取得优异成绩的精彩数学内容。但我要说的是，在中国审查制度的背景下，确实强调党所称的“**正能量**”。所以它确实比美国社交媒体平台要“干净”得多。你不会看到所谓的“不健康的婚姻价值观”之类的东西，那些都会被删除，对吧？所以，虽然一方面我不想说它们完全不同，但它们在出现的内容和不出现的内容方面确实有所不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: Exactly. Like when a young student, you know, in China is just like scrolling through, they're not just getting wonderful math content that's going to like help them excel at school. But what I will say is that definitely within the Chinese censorship context, there is this emphasis on what the party likes to call positive energy. So it is definitely much more sanitized than American social media platforms. Like you are not going to see quote unquote unhealthy marital values or like that is taken down, right? And so while on one hand I don't want to say like they're completely different, they definitely are different in terms of you know what appears there and what doesn't.

</details>

**Tracy**: 是的。既然你提到了学生，我们有没有看到党采取任何措施来，我想说，普遍打击互联网使用？我回想起，你知道，那次**视频游戏**禁令，当时有一种感觉或指令，认为孩子们花太多时间玩**视频游戏**，他们应该学习重要而有用的东西。出于好奇，你是否看到对互联网也有类似的态度？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Yeah. Since you mentioned students, have we seen any efforts by the party to, I guess, crack down on internet use in general? And I'm thinking back to, you know, the video game crackdown where there was, you know, a sense or a directive that kids were spending too much time playing video games and they should be learning important and useful things. Do you see a similar attitude towards the internet just out of curiosity?

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 不那么多。但我想说，**视频游戏**这部分是当你提出时我想到的。我认为问题在于互联网是日常运作和出行如此重要的一部分，你不能真的告诉一个年轻人不要用**微信**，如果那既是他与妈妈和老师交流的方式，也是他购买基本商品的方式。但你可以说：“好吧，让我们在每个工作日减少**视频游戏**的时间，因为那显然是弊大于利。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: not as much. But I would say the video game piece is the one that you know comes to mind when you bring it up. I think the issue being the internet is just such a vital part of daily operation and just getting around like you can't really tell a young person to get off WeChat if that's both how he communicates with his mom and his teacher, you know, and to buy basic goods. But you can say, "Well, let's get rid of video games for x amount of hours every weekday because that's clearly a net bad.

### TikTok禁令与小红书的意外涌入

**Joe**: 如果我会说中文，我能在这里开一个**微博**账号吗？能很容易地加入并和大家一起发帖吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: If I spoke Chinese, could I open up a Weebo account from here? Would it be easy to just start joining and posting with everyone?

**Yeling Louu**: 是的，好的，当然可以。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: Yeah, okay, definitely.

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: Good luck. Good luck.

</details>

**Joe**: 谢谢。谢谢。告诉我们历史上那五分钟，**TikTok**在美国被禁，突然间大量美国用户涌向那个**Rednote**之类的平台。我忘了它叫什么了。请告诉我们那次经历，以及从中是否出现了什么有趣的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Thank you. Thank you. Talk to us about those that five minute period in history in which Tik Tok was banned in the United States and suddenly there was a flood of American users to that other Red Note or something like that. I forgot what it was called. What talk to us about that experience and whether anything interesting emerged from that

</details>

**Tracy**: 那大概是10天左右发生的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: there was 10 days where that happened or whatever.

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 是的，那是一个令人难以置信的时刻。我记得非常清楚，但基本上当时有消息，即将有消息称**TikTok**将在美国被禁，所有这些**TikTok**用户。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: Yeah, it was an incredible moment. I remember it very clearly, but essentially there was news, impending news that Tik Tok would get banned in the US and all these Tik Tok.

</details>

**Tracy**: 它被禁了一天，但有一天无法访问。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: It was banned for like a day, but one day wasn't accessible. Yeah.

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 但在那之前，**TikTok**用户都快疯了，他们基本上，我想有数百万美国**TikTok**用户开始涌向**Rednote**，或者在中国被称为**小红书**，你知道，人们称它为中国的**Instagram**，但这不太准确。它更像是一个**Instagram**、**Pinterest**和**Yelp**结合的社交媒体平台，主要由年轻的城市女性使用。它有点偏向自由主义，用来获取生活方式新闻。现在它涵盖了各种新闻。但一方面，我被这种讽刺意味所震惊，你知道，美国互联网不知怎的变得如此封闭、孤立和受控，以至于逃离它的方式是跳到……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: But in the in the leadup to that, Tik Tok users were freaking out and they essentially, I think millions of American Tik Tok users started to flood Rednote or as it's known in China, Xiaoongu, which is, you know, people call it China's Instagram, but that's not quite the right equivalent. It's almost this Instagram meets Pinterest meets Yelp type social media platform mostly used by young urban women. Has a slightly more liberal bent to like catch up on lifestyle news. Now it's all kinds of news. But I was both on one hand struck by the irony of the situation, you know, that the American internet had somehow become so closed and siloed and controlled that the way to escape it was to then jump to

</details>

**Joe**: 可以说，这有点像“**柏林墙**倒塌”的反转时刻，西德人涌向了另一边，在这次……我不知道，类似的事情，这确实很讽刺，不是吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: arguably sort of like it was sort of like a reverse Berlin Wall moment in which the West the West Germans were the ones flooding into the other side after this uh I don't know something like That it's very Yeah, it is irony, doesn't it?

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 对。就像……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: Right. It's like

</details>

**Joe**: 我们是那些在美国受到限制的人，所以我们突然涌出来，在墙上找到一个新洞，涌到另一边。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: we were the ones that had the restriction placed on us in America and so then they suddenly like we spill up find a new hole in the wall to spill over onto the other side.

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 完全正确。这就是为什么，你知道，美国用户有点讽刺地在寻找他们的“中国间谍”，而中国用户则在教他们如何绕过**Rednote**的审查。但我认为，那一刻的关键是，我从中感受到了很多乐趣，因为那是互联网两边的用户之间第一次如此真诚和认真的交流，这种感觉我多年甚至几十年都没有感受到了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: Exactly. Which is why they were, you know, like I think American users were looking for their Chinese spies um kind of ironically and Chinese users were teaching them how to get around Red Note sensors. But I think like key to that was just like I felt a lot of delight from that moment because it was the first time there was this like really sincere and earnest exchange between users on both sides of the internet and I hadn't felt that and seen that in years if not decades.

</details>

**Tracy**: 所以，关于**TikTok**的一个持续不断的争论是算法在做什么，以及它实际上在呈现什么内容。这与中国的审查制度有什么相似之处？或者你认为算法在影响普通民众方面有哪些关键差异？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: So one of the debates that's constantly ongoing when it comes to Tik Tok is what the algorithm is doing and what content it's actually surfacing. What are the like parallels with I guess censorship in China or where do you see key differences in terms of what the algo can do to influence the general population?

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 所以你是说中国算法和美国算法之间的区别吗？我想说，你知道，算法在审查内容中扮演多大角色，这总是很难说清的，我认为这是目前**TikTok**出售面临的一个大问题，即使绝大多数所有权是美国人，算法仍然由**字节跳动**拥有，所以**字节跳动**在多大程度上仍然影响美国用户看到什么，这是一个问题。我认为区别在于中国。外部有更多的工具来控制之后发生的事情。算法如何决定出现在信息流中的内容并不重要。你知道，仍然有内容审核员可以在内容发布之后介入并处理在线发布的内容。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: So you mean like between the algorithm in China and the algorithm in the US? I would say that you know the algorithm it's it's always really hard to say to what extent the algorithm is playing a role in censorship censorship of the content right and I think that's one of the big issues or that the big criticisms that's playing out right now with this Tik Tok sale even though vast majority of the ownership is American the algorithm is still owned by bite dance so to what extent does bite dance still have influence over what American users are seeing that's up to question I think the difference is in China. There's just a lot more tools externally to kind of control what happens after that. It doesn't matter how the algorithm is dictating what appears on the feeds. You know, there are still content moderators who can come in and deal with the content that is posted online after, you know, it's it's already posted.

### 民族主义的兴起与互联网影响

**Joe**: 我想回到我们最初开始的地方，但我认为这是一个涉及相当重大风险的问题。所以你谈到了中国互联网上日益增长的民族主义冲动，这与这里的情况非常相似。我想说，很多人也会同意，如果你看看现在的美国政府，你会觉得它的病态、功能失调等等，几乎都是下游效应，互联网在很多方面塑造了美国政府。我们播客的嘉宾**Max Reed**，他有一个非常好的时事通讯，他谈到这就像评论区一样。而现在美国政府中的所有掌权者，都是10年前因为在评论区被禁而感到愤怒的人，现在他们对其他人笑到了最后，因为他们掌握了权力。请告诉我们中国互联网上这种强烈民族主义暗流的出现。它是什么时候开始出现的？它又是如何强化中国政治内部的政治走向的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: I want to go back to sort of kind of where we started at the beginning but I think it's a question of some pretty significant stakes you Um so you talk about the rise of the sort of like very nationalistic impulse that you see on the Chinese internet these days which again very similar to here and I would say and many people would agree that if you look at the US government right now you're like the pathologies the dysfunctions etc. It's like almost downstream like the internet has shaped the US government in many respects. Max Reed, who we've had on the podcast, who has a really good newsletter, talked about how it's like the comment section is one. And all of the people who are in power in the US government, are the people who like 10 years ago were angry about having been banned from the comment section and now they have the last laugh on everyone else because now they hold the levers of power. Talk to us about the emergence of the sort of strong nationalistic undercurrent on the Chinese internet. when did that like start to emerge and how does that sort of like reinforce the political direction of travel within chi within Chinese politics?

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 是的，我想说，与美国发生的情况类似，那种爱国主义的底色一直都在，早在互联网出现之前的80年代和90年代，就有人以一种更不自由的方式谈论爱国主义的中国。他们想要强人统治。他们不希望，你知道，中国很多左派（我们指的是中国语境下的左派，而不是美国语境下的）不希望中国被自由主义影响所席卷，需要一个强大的国家来掌控经济。但我想说，与美国类似，这种民族主义的声音非常边缘化。它是小众的。它被视为激进的。所以，你知道，早在2008年，例如，正如你提到的，有“**50美分大军**”，还有被称为“**愤怒青年**”或“**愤青**”的群体。所以2008年对中国来说是一个巨大的转折点，因为这个国家正以国际形象登上世界舞台，它想把自己展现得超级自由。但当时有一些非常愤怒的年轻人在线上，他们说：“看看**CNN**是如何报道中国的。我们正在被西方人抹黑。”但他们是少数。我想说，今天的中国互联网基本上是“**愤青**”的天下。他们不再被称为那个名字。但你知道，我想说在2016年，出现了我们现在称之为“**小粉红**”或“**sophen home**”的群体。这就像你把“**愤青**”或者说把爱国者与“**Stan**”或在线粉丝融合在一起。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: Yeah, I would say similar to what has happened in the US that patriotic undertone has always been there as early as like the pre- internet period of like the [clears throat] 80s and 90s of people who you know perhaps were speaking of a patriotic China in a more illiberal sense. They wanted strong man rule. They didn't want, you know, a lot of the leftists in China, as we think about them in China and not in the US, wanted, you know, China not to be kind of swept up by liberal influence and needed a strong state to be in charge of the economy. But I would say similar to the US, that nationalist voice was very fringe. It was niche. It was kind of seen as radical. So you know as early as 2008 for example there were as you mentioned like the 50 C army but also what was known as like angry youths or fening. So 2008 was like a hugely pivotal moment for China in that the country was stepping onto the world on the global stage as this international presence and it wanted to present itself as super liberal. But at the time there were these like very angry youth who were online and being like look at how China is being presented by CNN. We're being kind of smeared by Westerners. But they were small. I would say today the Chinese internet is largely fencing. They're no longer called that. But you know I would say in 2016 there's a an emergence of what we now call little pinks or sophen home. And it's like you merged the fenting or you merged the patriot with the Stan or the online fan

</details>

**Tracy**: 他们所说的，一种更温和的民族主义。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: where you know like what they a softer nationalism.

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 完全正确。或者甚至不是更温和，而是他们使用了在线粉丝的策略。所以，你知道，他们使用了与一群**贾斯汀·比伯**粉丝对付**贾斯汀·比伯**的对手时所用的相同策略，只不过他们现在对付的可能是**蔡英文**，她是**台湾**的领导人。所以我想说，在线互联网名人文化与在线爱国主义之间存在着这种融合。你知道，这与**Reddit**和**Zelda**并没有太大不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: Exactly. Or not even softer but they use the tactics of online fandom. So, you know, like they use the same tactics of like a group of Justin Bieber fans would do to take down Justin Bieber's nemesis where except they're doing that with maybe like Tyenwin who's the who was the leader of Taiwan. And so I would say there's this like fusion of online internet celebrity culture with online patriotism. And you know, it's not so much different from like the Reddit and Zelda.

</details>

**Joe**: 是的，感觉非常相似。我只想再深入探讨一下。去年我读了**Kevin Rudd**关于**习近平**的书，他提出的一个观点是，很多人认为**习近平**上台后才转向民族主义，但他指出，实际上中国政治中更民族主义的转向，一些反自由主义的倾向，早在**胡锦涛**执政后期就开始了。这让我再次思考，是否有一种酝酿中的力量，部分由互联网培养，正在兴起，而不是**习近平**上台后按下按钮，将互联网转向更民族主义的方向，而是这已经是一个正在出现的事情，并有助于解释**习近平**的持久性和巩固权力的能力等等，这是一种自下而上的现象，就像它是一种自上而下的现象一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Yeah, it feels very similar. I just want to just to go down this road a little bit further. Last year I read um Kevin Rudd's book about Xihinping and one of the points that he makes you know a lot of people think of okay she gets into power and then sort of takes this nationalist turn and he makes the point that actually the sort of more nationalist turn in Chinese politics some of the anti-liberal started under the late Hujanto years which makes me again wonder whether there was this brewing force partly cultivated by the internet that was starting you know that rather RA than okay Xiinping comes in and presses the button and turns the internet in a more nationalist direction that this was already an emerging thing and helps explain Xiinping's durability and ability to consolidate power and so forth that there's this sort of that it's a bottomup phenomenon as what as much as it is a top down thing.

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 绝对是。这就是为什么我一直回到2008年这个巨大的转折点。你的嘉宾之一**Kaiser**曾多次提出这个观点，那就是，你知道，在2008年，我认为当时发生的两件大事是a）**北京奥运会**和b）**金融危机**。所以在这个时刻，当中国人站起来，**防火墙**第一次被拆除，很多中国互联网用户在北京第一次看到了新闻。他们看到了两件事。他们看到了**CNN**报道**西藏**抗议活动，却没有报道奥运会。他们也最终看到了**金融危机**的消息。所以当时有一种感觉，就是，嗯，我们期望与外部世界接触，但西方却在批评中国，并且无法管理好自己的事情。所以，无论是普通民众还是领导层，都有一种日益增长的爱国主义情绪，因为他们当时在想，也许自由化不是正确的道路，也许自由化会导致混乱的金融市场，我们需要将这艘船驶向不同的方向。所以我们看到了民族主义的转向，也看到了自由主义的转向，而这都发生在**习近平**上台之前。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: Absolutely. And this is why I keep coming back to 2008 as this huge turning point. And Kaiser, who's one of your guests, has made this point a few times, which is, you know, in in 2008, I think the big thing that happened at the time was a the Beijing Olympics and b the financial crisis. So at this moment when, you know, Chinese people were standing up and for the first time a lot of like the great firewalls was getting taken down. So a lot of Chinese internet users in Beijing could see the news for the first time. They were seeing two things. They were seeing CNN, you know, posting news about the Tibet protests and not covering the Olympics. And they're also seeing eventually news of the financial crisis. So there was this sense of like, well, you know, we expected to engage with the outside world and instead the West is criticizing China and can't get its own ship in order. And so there is a sense both among kind of ordinary people of this growing patriotism but also the leader the leadership itself because they were thinking well maybe liberalization is not the way to go right maybe like liberalization leads to unruly financial markets and we need to steer this ship in a different direction and so we see both kind of a nationalistic turn but also in a liberal turn and that very much precedes Cinping's rise to power.

</details>

**Tracy**: 我认为人们忘记了2008年奥运会是多么重要的时刻。它确实从物理上改变了北京，也改变了许多中国社会。但我仍然对他们取消了所有那些盗版DVD店感到恼火，因为那些很有趣。无论如何，我们必须问一个**AI**问题。所以随着**AI**的出现，很多来自中国的技术都非常令人印象深刻。审查制度会变得更容易吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: I think people forget what a huge moment the 2008 Olympics actually were. Like actually physically changed Beijing and then also changed a lot of Chinese society. But I'm still I'm still annoyed that they got rid of all the uh fake DVD stores cuz those were fun. Anyway, we have to get in an AI question. So with the advent of AI, a lot of the technology which is coming out of China is very impressive. Does censorship become easier?

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 我会说是的。我的意思是，**AI**一直以来都被用于中国的审查能力，不仅仅是随着生成式**AI**的出现。所以，你知道，我采访的审查员说，在他甚至开始查看什么被删除之前，一个自动化程序首先会标记所有敏感词。我想这只会让这个过程变得更容易。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: I would say yes. I mean the AI has always been or it has been long used in Chinese censorship capacity, not just with the advent of generative AI. So you know the sensor that I interviewed, he said that, you know, before he even goes in and looks at what's being taken down, a, you know, automated process first flags all of the sensitive words. I imagine that just makes that process significantly easier.

</details>

### AI与审查的未来

**Joe**: 有没有办法衡量公众对互联网的看法？因为我认为在美国有很多人会说，是的，这太棒了。我很乐意让“**愤怒诱饵**”非法化。我很乐意看到人们不再炫富。我很乐意看到互联网上没有容易获得的色情内容等等。我认为很多人听到这些会觉得“嗯，听起来不错”。是否存在对审核状态的不满？是否存在对某些限制的不满？有没有办法衡量这些问题？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Is there any way to gauge sort of public opinion about the internet or like because I think there are a lot of people in the US again who would say like yes this would be great. I would love to make rage bait illegal. I would love it if people weren't flaunting their wealth. I would love it if there were not pornography easily available on the internet etc. I think a lot of people hear this and it's like yeah sounds pretty good. Is the is there discontent with the state of moderation? Is there discontent with some of the restrictions? Is there no like is there a way to like gauge some of these questions?

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 当然有不满，但我认为在中国普遍衡量公众舆论非常困难。我会说，总的来说，中国对技术变革和技术进步的接受程度比美国更高。但是，你知道，有人对审查制度不满，也有人喜欢这些控制。我想说，这场辩论或这种羡慕的核心在于，我们在这个**AI**时代可以建立什么样的治理机制，对吧？我认为每个人都对这种无法控制的新技术感到恐慌，而中国至少似乎有一个治理机制。所以，例如，有一个**算法注册表**，基本上每家拥有**AI**工具的公司都需要向当局提交他们的算法，然后将其列入公共注册表，而美国没有类似的机制，这实际上，我认为，是一种相当有趣的治理形式，也许是其他国家可以学习的。是的，我的意思是，人们批评这里的算法本质上是黑箱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: There's certainly discontent, but I think it's just very hard to gauge public opinion in China in general. I would say broadly speaking there is like embrace of technological change and embrace of technological progress that's more elevated in China than in the US. But you know there are people who are unhappy with the censorship regime and people who like having those controls. I will say at the heart of that kind of debate or that envy is just like what are the governance mechanisms that we can put in place at this moment with AI right? I think everyone's freaking out about this uncontrollable new technology and China at the very least seems to have a governance mechanism in place. So for example there is a algorithm registry where essentially every single company that has an AI tool needs to submit their algorithm to authorities and that is then listed in a public registry and no equivalent of that exists in the US and that's actually I think you know that's actually a pretty interesting form of governance and maybe something that other countries can learn from. Yeah, I mean people have criticized ALGO here for being essentially black boxes.

</details>

### 技术中心化与社会分化

**Joe**: 只是回到我们节目的开场。这里令人惊讶的是，你知道，美国和中国互联网尽管治理制度截然不同，但却遵循了非常相似的演变路径。所以我想在某种程度上你可以想象，好吧，中国互联网受到严格审查，显然民族主义会高涨，对吧？而在美国，我想也许更令人惊讶，但你认为我们最终会走到同一个地方的总体论点是什么，尽管我们有非常不同的系统？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Just coming I guess full circle back to our intro. The surprising thing here is you know the US and the Chinese internet have followed a very similar evolution despite very different governance regimes. So I think to some extent you could imagine all right Chinese internet heavily censored obviously there's going to be a surge of nationalism right whereas in the US I guess maybe it's more surprising but what's your overarching thesis for why we sort of ended up in the same place despite having very different systems?

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 是的，我的意思是，这是个好问题。我想首先我们会说，我们对技术甚至会朝着自由方向发展这一事实相当天真，对吧？这有点基于这样的假设。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: Yeah I mean that's a good question. I would say first we were pretty naive about the fact that technology even moves in the direction of freedom. Right? That's kind of like based on the assumption

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 这就是我们要走的方向。我想我的总体论点可能是，我们允许过多的技术集中在少数人手中，而且这并不重要，你知道，美国和美国系统，人们经常谈论差异，但实际上它们惊人地相似。无论是政府将技术权力集中在自己手中，还是像你提到的，少数科技寡头，归根结底，**埃隆·马斯克**对**X**或**Twitter**的控制与中国政府对**微博**的控制有多大区别？本质上是一个人的心血来潮决定了一个平台的运作方式，我认为这才是关键问题，那就是我们把这种去中心化的技术预算变成了高度中心化的，而这在何种政治体制下发生并不重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: that's just the direction that we're going to go in. I would say probably my overarching thesis is that we've allowed too much of technology to be centralized within the hands of a few people and it doesn't matter you know the US and American systems people often talk about the differences but actually they're remarkably similar. It doesn't matter if it is government that has centralized its you know the power of technology in its hands or as you mentioned like a handful of tech oligarchs right at the end of the day how different is Elon Musk's control over X or Twitter different from you know the Chinese government's control of way the whims of one man essentially dictates the way a platform plays out and I think that's the key problem is that we've taken this like decentralized technology budgy and make made it highly centralized and it doesn't matter under what political system that actually takes place.

</details>

**Tracy**: 我认为任何人都觉得，再次强调，我脑海中总是浮现的词是互联网的部落化效应。人们开始互相憎恨。他们开始憎恨那些与自己不完全相同的人。中国社会内部是否存在因所有人混杂在一起而加深或扩大的裂痕？是否存在某种人口统计学方面或其他方面的因素，让你看到这些团队间的紧张关系不断加剧，并影响国内稳定？因为我认为你在美国互联网上总是看到这种情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: One thing that I think anyone who the again the word that always pops into my head is sort of the tribalizing effect of the internet. People start to they hate each other. They start to hate people who aren't exactly like them. Are there cleavages within Chinese society that are deepening or widening because of everyone in the mix together? Are there sort of demographic aspects or whatever in which you could see these sort of team tensions build and sort of domestic stability because I think you see that all the time on the American internet.

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 我认为我观察到的最大裂痕就是沿着财富和不平等的界线。这就像我今天看到的另一个平行线。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: I think the biggest cleavage that I've observed is just along the lines of wealth and inequality. And that's like another parallel that I'm seeing today. And

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 我看到的最大相似之处在于那些正在构建新技术的人和那些正在使用并被技术使用的人之间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: the biggest parallel that I see is between those who are building the new technologies and those who are using and being used by it.

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 所以，你知道，有趣的是，当我访问中国时，我有一种非常相似的经历，就像我访问**硅谷**时一样，所有那些谈论、构建或投资这些新**AI**工具的人都非常兴奋，或者说，你知道，偶尔会有一个悲观主义者混在其中，但他们都非常兴奋。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: So you know funnily enough when I visit China I have a very similar experience of when I visit Silicon Valley where everyone who is talking about or building or investing in these new AI tools are really hyped or you know like there there's like an occasional doomer in the mix but they're very excited about it.

</details>

**Tracy**: 他们仍在努力建造它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: They're still working to build it.

</details>

**Yeling Louu**: 完全正确。[笑声]就像有一种能动性，有一种竞争感，就像我们是未来的建设者和创造者。然而，当你与那些只是使用技术，不了解它是如何构建或参与这个过程的人交谈时，会有一种深深的悲观感或缺乏能动性，你知道，这让我想起了“**NPC**”这个迷因。有一种感觉是，嗯，我实际上在这个过程中没有角色。就像我是一个非玩家角色，你知道，我没有发言权，所以这实际上是我在中国和美国都看到的最大裂痕。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: Exactly. [laughter] Like there's a sense of agency, there's a sense of competition like we are the builders and makers of the future. Whereas when you talk to just anyone who is just using the technology is not aware of how it's built or involved in that process, there's this kind of deep [music] sense of pessimism or a lack of agency, you know, which brings me back to this like NPC meme. There's a sense of, well, I don't actually have a role in this [music] process. like I'm a nonplayer character and you know I have no say [music] and so that actually is the biggest cleavage that I'm I'm seeing both in China and in the US.

</details>

**Joe**: 好的，**Yeling Louu**，新书《**墙舞者**》的作者，恭喜你。这本书非常棒，非常感谢你来到这里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: All right, Eling Lou, author of The Wall Dancers, congratulations. Phenomenal book and uh really appreciate [music] you coming on out.

**Yeling Louu**: 非常感谢邀请我。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Yeling Louu**: Thanks so much for having me.

</details>

**Tracy**: Joe，我真的很喜欢那次谈话，直到……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Tracy, I really enjoyed that conversation a lot and it really was not until

</details>

**Joe**: 我知道你也喜欢谈论互联网。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: I know you like talking about the internet too.

</details>

**Tracy**: 是的，我喜欢谈论互联网。我爱互联网，尽管用你的话说，在很多方面它是一个粪坑。但思考美国和中国互联网的相似之处，尽管在法律意义上它们表面上非常不同，这可能是我一段时间以来思考过的最引人入胜的话题之一。是的，我在那次谈话中一直在想，我会问什么更可怕，一群**小粉红**追着你，还是一群**K-pop**粉丝？这有点像一个玩笑问题，但另一方面，它突出了这一点，对吧？那就是互联网以及人们在互联网上的行为在不同地域之间惊人地相似。你属于哪个群体并不重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Yeah, I love talking about the I love the internet even though it is to your words and I would agree in many respects a cesspool but thinking about how similar the American and Chinese internets are despite ostensibly being very different in a in the legal sense is like probably one of the more fascinating threads I've thought about in a while I think. Yeah, I was thinking during that conversation, I was going to ask what's scarier, an army of little pinks coming after you or an army of K-pop fans? And it's sort of a facicious question, but on the other hand,

</details>

**Joe**: 它突出了这一点，对吧？那就是互联网以及人们在互联网上的行为在不同地域之间惊人地相似。你属于哪个群体并不重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: it highlights this point, right, which is the internet and the way people behave on the internet has been remarkably similar across geographies. It doesn't really matter like what group you're in.

</details>

**Tracy**: 不，我，我，我，我认为这是100%正确的。而且，你知道，**K-pop**粉丝作为他们自己的部落，可能危害最小的部落之一，对吧？可能像……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: No, I I I think that's 100% correct. And you know, again, the K-pop stands as their own tribe, but probably one of the less harmful ones, right? Like probably like

</details>

**Joe**: 他们想发飙的时候是很凶猛的，Joe。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: they are vicious when they want to be Joe.

</details>

**Tracy**: 嗯，我从来没有。对。我实际上，我想我发过一次关于**K-pop**的推文，然后我就想，我又要把它静音了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Well, I never Right. I actually I think I tweeted about K-pop once and I was like, I'm going to mute this again.

</details>

**Joe**: 我马上就静音这个帖子。但这就是我们所做的，对吧？我的意思是，感觉我们人类天生就被这种，我想说，**群体行为**所吸引，对吧？当面对这些新技术时，我们可以与志同道合的人联系，无论他们是分享我们对音乐的品味，还是分享某种民族冲动，或者其他什么。这可能是大多数人，很多人都会陷入的境地。所以我想这真的很有趣，尽管有所有这些关于不同规则等等的讨论，但这些模式却到处传播。另一件让我震惊的事情，这在其他节目中也出现过，那就是，你知道，人们认为中国是一个巨大的中心化实体，在某种程度上确实如此，但这个中心化实体实际执行政策的方式最终却是非常去中心化的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: I'm muting this thread right away. But this is what we do, right? I mean, it feels like we as people naturally are drawn to this sort of, I would say, mob behavior, right? when presented with these new technologies in which we can connect with like-minded people, whether they share our taste for music or whether they share sort of national impulses or whatever else. This is what most people a lot of people fall into maybe. And so I think it's like really interesting that for all Yeah. for all this like talk of different rules and so forth that these patterns just sort of propagate everywhere. The other thing that struck me, and this has come up before in other episodes, but it's the sort of, you know, people think about China as this big centralized entity, and it is to some extent, but the way that centralized entity actually executes policy ends up being very decentralized,

</details>

**Tracy**: 对吧？我认为这有点被低估了，个体审查员或个体地方政府在执行具体指令以及他们如何执行方面有多大的自由度。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: right? And I think that's kind of underappreciated, how much scope individual sensors or individual local governments have to enact specific directives and how they go about doing it.

</details>

**Joe**: 有趣的是，**微博**的竞争优势本质上是擅长审查，对吧？它是那个幸存下来的，并且能够预测等等。这有点令人伤感。我喜欢去中心化的互联网。去不同的网站看看人们都在做什么很有趣，理论上你仍然可以这样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: It's interesting that Waybo's competitive edge was essentially being the best at censorship, right? And that was the one that survived and sort of anticipating and so forth. And it's a little sad. I liked the decentralized internet. It was fun going to different people's websites and seeing what they're all about and you could theoretically still do it,

</details>

**Tracy**: 但它需要付出努力，这种努力不值得，当你只需一个算法就能直接提供你当下感兴趣的东西时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: but it takes effort in a way that doesn't feel worth it when you can just have an algorithm deliver straight what you're sort of id appeals to you like directly in the moment.

</details>

**Joe**: 那是个美好的时代。1990年代末是人类的巅峰。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: It was a great time. Late 1990s were the peak of humanity.

</details>

**Tracy**: 毫不讽刺，毫不讽刺。

**Tracy**: Unironically unironically that.

</details>

**Joe**: 你真的要学中文吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Are you really going to learn Chinese?

</details>

**Tracy**: 是的，我新年愿望之一是今年上**普通话**课，我会去做的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: So yeah, one of my New Year's resolutions is to is to take Mandarin classes this year and I will do that.

</details>

**Joe**: 我以前学**普通话**的时候真的很喜欢，因为语法很少，我讨厌语法，因为我不得不学德语，德语语法是最糟糕的。而且当你学习单词的时候，我真的很喜欢它的一点是，它非常字面化。所以很多单词的含义都反映了所谈论的事物。所以，例如，如果你谈论美国，那么美国是“**美**”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: I really liked learning Mandarin back way back in the day when I did it because there's very little grammar and I hate grammar because I had to learn German and German grammar is the worst. And also as you learn words, one thing I really like about it is it's very literal. So a lot of words have meanings that sort of reflect the thing being talked about. So for instance, if you're talking about America, so America is meo

</details>

**Tracy**: “**美**”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: meo

</details>

**Joe**: 意思是“美丽的国家”。所以那种……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: which means beautiful country. So that sort of like

</details>

**Tracy**: 哦，有意思。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: oh interesting

**Joe**: 含义融入了这些独立的词语中，或者**奥地利**，因为那是我的另一半，它意味着“东方帝国”。

**Joe**: 这，你知道，再次非常形象地描述了你所谈论的事物。
