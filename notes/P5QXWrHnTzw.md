### AlphaGo的“第37步”与超级智能的曙光

我的联合创始人是**AlphaGo**（AlphaGo: 谷歌DeepMind开发的人工智能围棋程序）项目做出关键贡献的人之一，他也是少数几位飞往现场观看与**李世石**（Lee Sedol: 韩国围棋九段棋手）比赛的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My co-founder was one of the people who made key contributions to the project of AlphaGo and he was one of the handful of people who flew out to the match with Lisa Doll.</p>
</details>

我认为真正让我深刻认识到“超级智能”的存在，并开始想象未来它可能是什么样子的，是**第37步**（Move 37: AlphaGo在与李世石的比赛中下出的一步出人意料的棋），我相信许多其他人也有同感。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the thing that really made me internalize deeply there's a super intelligence here and imagine what those things might look like in the future and I think this this was true for many other people as well was move 37.</p>
</details>

这是AlphaGo在与李世石的比赛中下出的一步著名棋局，最初看起来像是一个错误。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This was a famous move where Alph Go in its match against Lisa Doll made a move that looked like a mistake initially.</p>
</details>

它看起来甚至可能是一个程序错误。团队的一些成员认为，就像语言模型会产生幻觉，有时会编造一些东西一样，这可能是游戏代理基本编造了一个不正确的走法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It looked like potentially a bug. Some members of the team thought that in the same way that language models hallucinate like they'll sometimes make something up that this was game agent basically making up a move that was incorrect.</p>
</details>

李世石，或者至少是评论员们，似乎也这么认为。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It seemed like Lisa Doll or at least the commentators thought that as well.</p>
</details>

几步之后，大约10步左右，事实证明这实际上是一个绝妙的走法，比任何观看比赛的人类所能想象的都要聪明。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Few moves later, maybe 10 moves or something like that later. It turned out that this was actually a brilliant move that was smarter than anything that any of the humans who were viewing the match could have imagined.</p>
</details>

它太聪明了，以至于所有人都认为它很愚蠢。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It was so smart that everyone thought it was dumb.</p>
</details>

这意味着一个AI系统发现了一种根本上更具创造性的策略。这让我思考，当“第37步”出现在所有知识工作领域时，世界会变成什么样子。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What that meant was that an AI system had discovered a strategy that was fundamentally more creative. And it made me think about what will a world look like when you have move 37s across every category of knowledge work.</p>
</details>

例如，一位数学家请AI完成某项任务，AI返回了一个“第37步”——一个数学家从未考虑过但却是正确的证明。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, a mathematician asks an AI to do a certain task for it and comes back to it with a move 37. It comes back to it with a proof that the mathematician had never even considered that was correct.</p>
</details>

我认为最终会发生的是，就像我们现在开始感受到**AGI**（Artificial General Intelligence: 人工通用智能）的某些火花一样，在不远的将来，可能在未来几年内，我们将开始感受到**ASI**（Artificial Super Intelligence: 人工超级智能）的存在，届时“第37步”将出现在知识工作的各个领域，并基本上扩展我们的创造力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What I think what end up happening is that in the same way that we're feeling some people are starting to feel the AGI now where there are kind of semblances of sparks of intelligence. I think we'll start getting into this point in time in the notsodistant future, probably in the next couple of years, where we're starting to feel the ASI, the artificial super intelligence, where move 37s start popping up across different areas of knowledge work and doing things that basically expand our creativity, right?</p>
</details>

因为当“第37步”发生时，它实际上扩展了我们对围棋游戏以及可能性的认知。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because when move 37 happened, it actually expanded our knowledge of the game of go and what was possible.</p>
</details>

所以，它发生了，现在人们都知道了这种新策略。下棋或下围棋的人如何与AI互动？他们实际上是从AI那里学习，通过与这些AI互动来提高自己。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, it was a very it happened and now there's this new strategy that people are aware. How do people who play chess or go, how do they interact with AIs? They actually learn from them. They learn to get better from interacting with these AIs and I think we'll start learning a lot from these systems in the coming years and that's very exciting.</p>
</details>

我认为在未来几年里，我们将从这些系统中学习到很多东西，这非常令人兴奋。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And I think we'll start learning a lot from these systems in the coming years and that's very exciting.</p>

### ReflectionAI：通过自主编程构建超级智能

我是Misha，**Reflection**（Reflection: Misha Laskin联合创立的AI公司）的首席执行官兼联合创始人。在Reflection，我们正在构建超级智能。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm Misha. I'm the CEO and co-founder of Reflection. At Reflection, we are building super intelligence.</p>
</details>

问题是如何实现？我们相信，如果你解决了**自主编程**（Autonomous coding: 人工智能系统独立完成代码编写的能力）的问题，你就能更广泛地解决超级智能问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The question is how? Our belief is that if you solve the problem of autonomous coding, you will solve the super intelligence problem more broadly.</p>
</details>

这就是我们的路径。至于我们是如何走到这一步的，在过去十年里，我们的团队在AI领域取得了许多突破。我的联合创始人Giannis是**深度Q网络**（Deep Q Networks: 一种结合深度学习和Q学习的强化学习算法）、**AlphaZero**（AlphaZero: DeepMind开发的通用棋类AI程序）等系统的关键架构师之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that's kind of our path. Now in terms of you know how we got here the team pioneered a lot of breakthroughs in AI over the last decade my co-founder Giannis was one of the key architects of systems like deep Q networks alpho alpha zero and then Giannis and I worked together very closely on Gemini where we led a lot of the post- training work for producing Gemini 1 and 1.5 we kind of realized that two ingredients had come together that would enable you to take these language models create not just useful co-pilots or chat assistants, but intelligent capable autonomous systems.</p>
</details>

之后，Giannis和我紧密合作开发**Gemini**（Gemini: 谷歌开发的多模态大型语言模型），我们领导了许多后期训练工作，以生产Gemini 1和1.5。我们意识到，两个要素已经结合在一起，这将使你能够利用这些语言模型，不仅创建有用的副驾驶或聊天助手，还能创建智能、有能力的自主系统。

<details>

<p class="english-text">And then Giannis and I worked together very closely on Gemini where we led a lot of the post- training work for producing Gemini 1 and 1.5 we kind of realized that two ingredients had come together that would enable you to take these language models create not just useful co-pilots or chat assistants, but intelligent capable autonomous systems.</p>
</details>

这两个要素是：大型语言模型，它们通常非常广泛；另一个要素是**强化学习**（Reinforcement learning: 一种机器学习范式，通过与环境互动学习最优行为）作为一种技术，它能够扩展语言模型的自主性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And these two ingredients, large language models are very broad in general. And the other ingredient was reinforcement learning as a technology which enables scaling up the autonomy of language models.</p>
</details>

我们认为这两个要素已经成熟到足以结合起来，并生产出一种高度有能力的超级智能自主系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We thought these two ingredients had come together were kind of mature enough technologically that you could combine them and produce something that would be a highly capable super intelligent autonomous system.</p>
</details>

### 从物理学到AI：Misha Laskin的个人成长与思考

我出生在俄罗斯，苏联解体时，我和家人搬到了以色列。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was born in in Russia and when the Soviet Union collapsed my family and I I moved to Israel.</p>
</details>

我当时只有一岁，不记得这些。我的童年前半段在以色列度过，后半段在华盛顿州，因为我们经常搬家。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean this was I I don't remember this. I was one and then grew up first half my childhood in Israel, second half of my childhood in Washington state because we moved around fairly frequently.</p>
</details>

我没有像其他人那样建立长期的友谊，那种从童年持续到成年的终身友谊。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I didn't have the same, let's say, long form bonds that some other people do when they grow up. Lifelong kind of friendships going from childhood all the way to adulthood.</p>
</details>

因此，我最终花了很多时间独处，尤其是在美国的时候，我常与书为伴。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As a result, I actually ended up spending a lot of time kind of especially when we were in the states alone and with books.</p>
</details>

我的父母带来了很多书，我也有朋友，但放学后我大部分时间都在看父母的书库，阅读各种东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I mean we had my parents brought a lot of books to the states and I did have friends but I also spent a lot of time after school just looking at my parents' library reading various things at the time you know there's definitely you know as a kid you start feeling pretty lonely about that but looking back I don't think I would have cultivated the interest that I did if I didn't have a lot of time on my own to be bored and think in some sense like boredom is a gift that you only appreciate in retrospect.</p>
</details>

作为一个孩子，你肯定会感到相当孤独，但回想起来，如果没有大量独处的时间去感到无聊和思考，我想我不会培养出我所拥有的兴趣。从某种意义上说，无聊是一种只有在事后才能体会到的礼物。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was interested in physics and in literature when I kind of had all this time on my hands hands but ended up kind of hard committing to physics and the reason was that when when I read about kind of all the kind of most impactful science that had been done and the technology that produced. I would look back at the like technological artifacts that we have today and try to derive how are those originated and so an example is is a computer obviously incredibly impactful technology everyone uses today and and I was asking myself well how was that invented and you can trace it back you can go much further back as well but really there are some core components are invented that enabled this and one of them was a transistor and a transistor was invented by a theoretical physicist named John Bardin.</p>
</details>

我当时对物理学和文学都很感兴趣，但最终坚定地选择了物理学。原因在于，当我阅读那些最具影响力的科学成就及其所产生的技术时，我会回顾我们今天拥有的技术产品，并试图追溯它们的起源。例如，计算机显然是一种影响深远的、人人都在使用的技术，我问自己它是如何发明的？你可以追溯到更早，但真正有一些核心组件的发明才使其成为可能，其中之一就是**晶体管**（Transistor: 一种半导体器件，用于放大或开关电子信号），而晶体管是由理论物理学家**约翰·巴丁**（John Bardeen: 著名物理学家，晶体管的发明者之一）发明的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Similarly when you think of technologies like GPS and you trace back to what is the ingredient that enables those technologies to work. It turns out it's also physics. GPS relies heavily on Einstein's theory of special relativity.</p>
</details>

同样地，当你想到像**GPS**（全球定位系统: 一种基于卫星的导航系统）这样的技术时，追溯到使其发挥作用的关键要素，你会发现那也是物理学。GPS严重依赖**爱因斯坦**（Albert Einstein）的**狭义相对论**（Special relativity: 爱因斯坦提出的物理理论，描述了空间与时间的关系）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I wanted to work at that root node of the science that will enable everything else that comes after it. I wanted to work on the stuff that if we look at the technology we have a few decades from now and we trace back to what was the breakthrough that enabled that. I wanted to be working on those things. That's what got me interested in physics.</p>
</details>

所以，我想在科学的那个根节点上工作，那个能促成其后一切发展的根节点。我想研究那些如果我们在几十年后回顾现有技术，并追溯到是什么突破使其成为可能，我希望自己正在研究那些东西。这就是我开始对物理学感兴趣的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What I learned when I was in the PhD was that you have to kind of think about the science but not just the impactful science at any time. You have to think about what is the impactful science of the time today.</p>
</details>

我在攻读博士学位时学到的是，你必须思考科学，但不仅仅是任何时候有影响力的科学，你必须思考当今时代有影响力的科学是什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The work in physics that I was reading about was basically done anywhere from 60 to 100 years ago. That's when all of the these kind of impactful inventions were made.</p>
</details>

我当时阅读的物理学研究，基本上都是60到100年前完成的。那时，所有这些有影响力的发明都已诞生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I realized that the field at least for me had crystallized a bit. It was hard for me to see how like what foundational breakthroughs I could be a part of. and not necessarily individually but as a team that would enable the next generation of technology.</p>
</details>

我意识到，至少对我来说，这个领域已经有些固化了。我很难看到自己能参与到哪些基础性突破中，不一定是个人，而是作为一个团队，能够推动下一代技术的发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And at the same time I saw deep learning as a field taking off. And right around this time Alph Go happened and Alph Go was the first I would say major worldwide proof point of super intelligence of a neural network being trained to master a very complex board game go at a level that was more intelligent than the most capable human player.</p>
</details>

与此同时，我看到**深度学习**（Deep learning: 机器学习的一个分支，使用多层神经网络进行学习）领域正在崛起。大约就在这个时候，AlphaGo问世了。AlphaGo是我认为第一个主要的、全球性的超级智能证明点，它是一个**神经网络**（Neural network: 模拟人脑神经元连接方式的计算模型），经过训练后掌握了围棋这一非常复杂的棋盘游戏，其智能水平甚至超越了最强大的人类棋手。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I thought there was something really fundamental going on here. and I had to understand it effectively inside out. So I actually ended up dropping what I was doing and self-eing AI for it must have been four or five months and made some progress there where I started doing some independent research that opened up some doors after that.</p>
</details>

我当时觉得这里发生了一些非常根本性的事情，我必须彻底理解它。所以我最终放弃了当时正在做的事情，自学了四五个月的AI，并取得了一些进展，开始做一些独立研究，这为我之后打开了一些大门。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But it was really the realization that AI and in particularly deep learning and reinforcement learning were these kinds of building blocks of foundational ingredients of the science of our time that will lead to the most impactful technologies in within the next few decades.</p>
</details>

但真正让我意识到的是，人工智能，特别是深度学习和强化学习，是我们这个时代科学的基础构建模块和核心要素，它们将在未来几十年内带来最具影响力的技术。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like there there are a lot of similarities I think between entrepreneurship and research and science. But it is this kind of ability to look at a problem that looks really complex and messy and be able to reduce it down to some core set of principles that are actually guiding basically the direction of that problem.</p>
</details>

我认为创业、研究和科学之间有很多相似之处。但它是一种能力，能够审视一个看起来非常复杂和混乱的问题，并将其简化为一些核心原则，这些原则实际上指导着问题的方向。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know for research it could be you know the problem we're interested in let's say is is autonomy. Like we really care about getting these large language models to be capable and autonomous. And the question is how do you do that? How do you train them to do this? There are all sorts of ways to pursue this question.</p>
</details>

你知道，对于研究来说，我们感兴趣的问题可能是自主性。我们非常关心如何让这些大型语言模型变得有能力和自主。问题是如何做到这一点？如何训练它们做到这一点？有各种各样的方法来解决这个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You can go in many ways, but it turns out there are typically only one or two things that really move the needle in a very major way.</p>
</details>

你可以尝试多种途径，但通常只有一两个关键点能真正带来重大突破。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This sort of a framework that physics gives you for thinking about things allows you to one come in with that assumption and rather than looking for hundreds of solutions, really try to find the most impactful ones, but then have some rigor in your thinking that allows you to reduce it to to those base components.</p>
</details>

物理学为你提供了一种思考事物的框架，它让你能够带着这种假设，而不是寻找数百种解决方案，而是真正尝试找到最具影响力的解决方案，然后你的思维中会有一种严谨性，使你能够将其简化为那些基本组成部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I'd say that's true for all aspects of company building. There's the research part, there's a product part, there's a customer part.</p>
</details>

我想说，这适用于公司建设的所有方面。有研究部分，有产品部分，有客户部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And typically in any one of the major buckets of company building, there's one or two fundamental problems. And everything else doesn't really matter.</p>
</details>

通常在公司建设的任何一个主要环节中，都有一两个根本性问题，其他一切都不那么重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the question is, how do you identify those one or two fundamental problems that will move the needle, that will solve your customer's problems, that will be packaged in the right way as a product, that will make it easy to use, that will yield the research breakthroughs that you're looking for.</p>
</details>

问题是，你如何识别那一两个能推动全局的根本问题，它们能解决客户的问题，能以正确的方式包装成产品，能使其易于使用，并能带来你所寻求的研究突破？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think physics is very helpful for thinking about these problems.</p>
</details>

我认为物理学对于思考这些问题非常有帮助。

### 大实验室与初创公司的选择：自主性与产品耦合

我认为大型实验室有很多优势。它们拥有大量的计算资源，有很多才华横溢的人才。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think big labs have a lot of things going for them. There's a lot of compute. There are a lot of talented people.</p>
</details>

我认为许多问题都适合在大型实验室中解决。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There are many problems that are suitable I think for solving in in a big lab.</p>
</details>

最终，我们当时认为，在Gemini 1和1.5发布之后，人们对事物的思考范式基本上是构建更强大的聊天机器人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ultimately we thought at the time this was you know after launch of Gemini 1 1.5 the paradigm for how people were thinking about things were basically building more capable chat bots.</p>
</details>

而我们从很早以前就深感兴趣的，甚至在我们DeepMind工作之前，就是自主性问题，这也是我们进入AI领域的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What we were deeply interested in since before this was kind of independent of our time at Deepmind. This is why we got into AI is the problem of autonomy and we really wanted to work on that and we felt that it is both a research problem and a product problem because suppose you build this really great highly capable autonomous intelligence.</p>
</details>

我们非常想研究这个问题，并且认为它既是一个研究问题，也是一个产品问题。因为假设你构建了一个非常出色、能力极强的自主智能系统，你如何知道它是否真的有效？你如何知道它是否解决了人们的问题？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How do you know if it's actually working? How do you know if it's solving people's problems?</p>
</details>

在Reflection，我们相信最重要的评估是真实世界的评估。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One of the things we believe at reflection is that the evaluation that matters most is the real world evaluation.</p>
</details>

所以，如果你不与客户合作，不构建产品，你实际上就没有在最重要的环境中评估你的技术。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if you're not working with customers and you're not building product, you're not actually evaluating your technology in the place that matters.</p>
</details>

我们只是觉得，通过一个更小、更专注的团队，我们能够在研究上更快地前进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We just felt that we'd be able to move faster on the research with a smaller, more focused team.</p>
</details>

我们希望能够与产品和客户深度结合，以确保我们的研究方向正确。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And we wanted to be coupled very deeply with product and customers to make sure that we were steering our research in the right directions.</p>
</details>

要让一个已经有产品方向的大型组织，一艘正朝着某个方向前进的巨轮，改变航向，是非常困难的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's really hard to take a large organization that already has a product direction and is it's a big ship that is going in a certain direction. And if you internally believe that it should be going in a different direction, it's really hard to change to course correct. It's it's basically impossible.</p>
</details>

如果你内心认为它应该走向不同的方向，那么改变或纠正航向真的很难，基本上是不可能的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so this was this was the main impetus for for starting as a company rather than doing it in a large lab.</p>
</details>

所以，这就是我们选择创办公司而不是在大实验室里进行研究的主要动力。

### 大型模型训练的经验：大道至简

从构建Gemini和之前的系统中学到的一些见解至今仍有共鸣，但我可以只谈Gemini。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There are several insights that continue to resonate today from building Gemini and systems before that as well, but I can keep it specific to Gemini.</p>
</details>

其中之一是，在如此大规模的层面上，那些往往奏效的东西，这些是巨大的模型，其规模之大难以想象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">One is that the things that tend to work at this level of scale, these are giant model. These are it's hard to comprehend how big these models are.</p>
</details>

也许可以给一个基准：五年前人们训练的神经网络大约是1000万参数，1亿参数的神经网络就被认为是巨大的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Maybe to give a baseline the neural networks people were training say 5 years ago were 10 million parameter neural networks 100 million neural network was considered huge.</p>
</details>

DeepMind发布时，它是一个超过6000亿参数的神经网络。这些系统是庞大的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Deep came out and it's a over 600 billion parameter neural network. These systems are massive.</p>
</details>

在AI的规模化时代之前，复杂精妙的理念会胜出，你会拿一个小的东西，然后运用非常复杂、几乎是数学上精妙的理念，这些似乎奏效。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What ended up happening in AI in the before the era of scaling is that sophisticated complex ideas won like that you'd take a something small and you'd have like really complex kind of almost like mathematically sophisticated ideas and those seem to work and in the era of training these large systems and Gemini in particular it's the opposite.</p>
</details>

但在训练这些大型系统，特别是Gemini的时代，情况恰恰相反。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The simple ideas implemented at a great level of detail are the things that work.</p>
</details>

以极高的细节水平实现的简单想法才是奏效的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you almost had to kind of flip a switch in your mind about how to approach research problems from adding increasing complexity until it works.</p>
</details>

所以你几乎必须在脑海中转换一种思维方式，从不断增加复杂性直到奏效，转变为如何处理研究问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like an example of that is IBM blue like the system that beat Garrett Kasparov in chess. It was a very complex kind of uh basically treel like structure right that elicited all possible moves in chess then picked some best some of the best ones.</p>
</details>

例如，**IBM深蓝**（IBM Blue: 国际商用机器公司开发的国际象棋电脑，曾击败世界冠军**加里·卡斯帕罗夫**（Garry Kasparov））这个在国际象棋中击败**加里·卡斯帕罗夫**（Garry Kasparov）的系统，它是一种非常复杂的树状结构，列举了国际象棋中所有可能的走法，然后从中选择一些最佳的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The opposite is true for training these large language models. The objectives are very simple like predicting the next token or the next word is a very simple objective.</p>
</details>

但训练这些大型语言模型的情况则相反。目标非常简单，比如预测下一个词元或下一个词，这是一个非常简单的目标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The reinforcement learning algorithms tend to be pretty simple. My co-founder Giannis and I led a lot of the work in it's called reinforcement learning from human feedback or RLHF.</p>
</details>

强化学习算法也倾向于非常简单。我的联合创始人Giannis和我领导了许多**基于人类反馈的强化学习**（RLHF: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback）方面的工作。

<details>

如果你看看这方面的公开研究，比如**Llama**（Llama: Meta AI开发的大型语言模型系列）或**DeepSeek**（DeepSeek: 一种开源大型语言模型）等其他大型模型是如何训练的，你会发现它们都是非常简单的算法，与五年前或十年前强化学习研究人员的设想相比。

我对某些事情可能有一些非传统的看法，也许其他人不会这么想。我不会替别人发言，但我确实认为，在Reflection，我们深信的一个前提是编程问题，特别是自主编程，是多么根本性地重要。

<p class="english-text">There are some things that I have an unconventional maybe opinion on that maybe some other people might not think about. I won't speak for other people but I do think that one of the premise that we deeply believe in in reflection how fundamentally important the coding problem is and specifically autonomous coding the ability for an AI system to autonomously co code something on a computer and kind of go from task to something that's completed and give that to the user I think it's a common way to think about such systems is that they're going to be useful for software engineers that makes sense coding is that software engineers do a point of view that I have and it's not just myself but our team at reflection is that coding is going to transcend software engineering.</p>
</details>

AI系统能够在计算机上自主编写代码，并从任务开始直到完成并交付给用户。我认为，通常人们会认为这类系统对软件工程师有用，这很合理，因为编程是软件工程师的工作。但我，以及我们Reflection团队的观点是，编程将超越软件工程。

<details>

<p class="english-text">It's going to go much further beyond that and touch basically every other piece of work category of work on a computer.</p>

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the reason for that is that when we think about how a language model is going to do work on a computer, we have to think about what is its embodiment? What is the natural way for a language model to interface with a computer? Effectively, what are its hands and legs?</p>
</details>

原因在于，当我们思考语言模型如何在计算机上工作时，我们必须思考它的“具身性”是什么？语言模型与计算机交互的自然方式是什么？实际上，它的“手和脚”是什么？

<p class="english-text">For people, we have really strong spatial priors that were evolved through millions of years of evolution. And so we have hands. We're dextrous and we have really good kind of innate spatial reasoning. We're born with it.</p>

对于人类来说，我们拥有非常强大的**空间先验**（Spatial priors: 人类在进化过程中形成的对空间关系的内在理解），这是通过数百万年的进化形成的。所以我们有手，我们灵巧，我们拥有非常好的、天生的空间推理能力。我们生来就具备这些。

### 提出正确问题的重要性与思维清晰度

我认为关于提出正确的问题，我可能更多地是指具体意义上的。比如，假设你从事创意工作，并且想把它做好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think on asking the right questions maybe I mean it more in the concrete sense of like you suppose you're you have a job in creative pursuit and you want to do a good job at it right you have to there's some uncertainty on it either you have to build a new product or figure out some research like breakthrough or make a piece of art that actually resonates with people right if you're I mean there's one thing of like making art for yourself but if you want to make art for you know that will resonate with people that's kind of another thing so how do you know what to pick how do you know you're going to be right that's kind of what I mean around asking the right questions.</p>
</details>

你必须面对一些不确定性，要么你需要开发新产品，要么找出一些研究突破，或者创作一件真正能引起人们共鸣的艺术品。我的意思是，为自己创作艺术是一回事，但如果你想创作能引起人们共鸣的艺术，那就是另一回事了。所以，你如何知道该选择什么？你如何知道自己会是正确的？这就是我所说的“提出正确的问题”的含义。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So for example, like in the next year there's going to be one or two breakthroughs in AI. Every year there are basically one or two breakthroughs in AI. How do you discover one of them? Like what question should you be asking to discover one of them? It's really hard.</p>
</details>

举个例子，比如明年AI领域会有一两个突破。每年基本上都会有一两个AI突破。你如何发现其中一个？你需要提出什么问题才能发现其中一个？这真的很难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What direction would you point them at? And how would you ask them the questions to elicit those behaviors?</p>
</details>

你会将它们指向哪个方向？你又会如何向它们提问，以引出那些行为？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like another concrete example I'll give is that during reinforcement learning before language models, this is like AlphaGo days. It would take like billions of steps for a reinforcement learning training to get like an agent that was competent.</p>
</details>

再举一个具体的例子，在语言模型出现之前的强化学习时代，也就是AlphaGo时期，强化学习训练需要数十亿步才能得到一个有能力的代理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so people are looking at and saying, "Wow, billions of steps, that's so long. How do we make it more efficient?"</p>
</details>

所以人们看到后会说：“哇，数十亿步，太久了。我们如何提高效率？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That was the question people were asking. How do we go from billions to make it 10x more efficient? So now it's hundreds of millions and 10x more efficient. So it's tens of millions.</p>
</details>

这就是人们当时问的问题：我们如何从数十亿步提高10倍效率？这样就变成了数亿步，再提高10倍效率，就变成了数千万步。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was asking that question myself and that was the wrong question to ask.</p>

我自己也在问这个问题，但那是一个错误的问题。

<p class="english-text">But you're kind of saying like the reason you wanted to make it more data efficient is because you wanted to get these general agents.</p>

但你实际上是说，你之所以想让它更数据高效，是因为你想得到这些通用代理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the way people thought about getting general agents is just make them really fast to train.</p>
</details>

人们认为获得通用代理的方法就是让它们训练得非常快。

<p class="english-text">And it turned out that the right question was to ask was basically to invent language models because language models without any of this kind of reinforcement learning training became very general.</p>

结果证明，正确的问题实际上是发明语言模型，因为语言模型在没有任何这种强化学习训练的情况下，变得非常通用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If I would have thought about it that way then I would have picked a different research question to work on.</p>
</details>

如果我当时那样思考，我就会选择一个不同的研究问题来解决。

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So right there are plenty of examples where I made the wrong like even if it was locally the correct answer.</p>

</details>

至少对我个人而言，那就是写作。通常，当我试图表达我想要实现的目标，或者我正在尝试的方法时，我会用书面形式表达出来，我会把它写下来，然后以短文的形式进行修改，因为写作往往会暴露出思维的模糊不清。就像在写作时，每个句子都应该有意义，都应该有其存在的理由。

### 创业的挑战与动力：愿景、人才与韧性

对于任何初创公司来说，我认为没有一个特别困难的时期。我认为困难会随着公司发展的不同阶段而累积，每个阶段都有不同的困难，而且它们可能都同样艰难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So for any startup I would say there it's not like there's I think one particular hardest time. I think that hard times accumulate over different stages of the company have different hard times and they're probably kind of you know all equally hard.</p>
</details>

但在最初阶段，困难在于你面对一张白纸。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But in the very beginning, the things that are hard is you come in and you have a blank slate.</p>

你需要将这张白纸转化为一个更具方向性和专注性的东西，并围绕它建立清晰的认知，使其与你的长期使命、你想要实现的目标保持一致，同时在短期内它也能奏效，并帮助你实现长期目标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's sort of reducing that blank slate into something that is much more directed and focused and having clarity around that with how it aligns with your long-term mission, what you're trying to achieve, but also that short term it's a thing that will work and get you to kind of the longerterm objective.</p>

<p class="english-text">Having clarity on that is really important. And it's quite hard uh in the beginning of startup to develop that clarity.</p>
</details>

这就是为什么当人们称之为**业务转向**（Pivot: 初创公司在发展过程中改变其核心产品或商业模式）时，实际上是初创公司对某件事下了赌注，但它没有奏效。

<details>

<p class="english-text">This is why when people call it something a pivot, it's really, you know, a startup took a bet on something that uh did not work and right and so then they developed some clarity and then they they pivoted to something.</p>

然后他们获得了一些清晰的认识，然后转向了其他方向。

<p class="english-text">So you have to have good reasons for why you believe your short-term uh wedge into the broader mission is compelling like what why is this correct and in our case it's focusing solely on autonomous coding um and nothing else and we have reasons to believe why that is the kind of correct bet if you want to aim at the problem of super intelligence and so I think those are the kind of the way you motivate people is by doing something really ambitious.</p>
</details>

所以你必须有充分的理由相信你的短期切入点在更广泛的使命中是具有吸引力的，比如为什么这是正确的。在我们的案例中，它完全专注于自主编程，别无其他。我们有理由相信，如果你想解决超级智能问题，这是一个正确的选择。所以我认为，激励人们的方式就是做一些真正雄心勃勃的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I had a previous startup before this and we did something much smaller and it was actually really hard to attract good people to work with us because it was sort of not you know you have one life and people want to work on the thing that will be most impactful to them building super intelligence is a pretty I would say it's at a similar level ambition of like taking people to Mars right of building rocket ships that go into space and take people to Mars and even though that seems really out there and difficult to achieve really talented people are attracted to very hard problems and very concrete approaches to solve those problems.</p>
</details>

在此之前我曾创办过一家初创公司，我们做的事情规模小得多，实际上很难吸引优秀的人才与我们合作，因为那不是……你知道，人只有一次生命，人们都想做对他们最有影响力的事情。构建超级智能，我认为其抱负水平与将人类送上火星，建造能够进入太空并把人类送上火星的火箭飞船相似。尽管这看起来非常遥远且难以实现，但真正有才华的人才却会被非常困难的问题以及解决这些问题的非常具体的方法所吸引。

### 应对挫折：深度关怀与持续学习

应对挫折的方式，我认为主要有两点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the way to deal with setbacks. I think I mean there there are basically two main things.</p>
</details>

第一点是，你必须深深地关心你正在做的事情。这取决于什么激励你，但对我们来说，这是我们追求的使命和方法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The first one is to deeply care what you're caring what you're working on. It depends on what inspires you but for us right it's kind it's the mission that we're going after and the approach.</p>
</details>

所以我们深深地关心，我也深深地关心，这非常有动力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we just deeply care and I I deeply care and that's really motivating.</p>
</details>

你必须深深地关心这个问题，然后你必须深深地关心与你一起解决问题的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You have to deeply care about the problem and then you have to deeply care about the people who are working with you on the problem.</p>
</details>

我认为有了这两点，那些原本会让人感到挫折的事情，就不会真的那么觉得了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think with those two things, things that feel that would otherwise feel like setbacks, I don't know, don't really feel that way.</p>
</details>

也许是因为研究人员的整个职业生涯都在不确定性中度过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Maybe it's because researchers have operated that their whole career is in uncertainty.</p>
</details>

整个游戏规则就是你选择并尝试选择正确的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's the whole game is that you pick try to pick the right problem.</p>
</details>

围绕它有很多不确定性，有很多挫折，但只要问题对你来说真的很有趣，并且你觉得你正在采取的方法是富有成效的，你就会坚持下去。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's a lot of uncertainty around it. There are a lot of setbacks and you persist so long as the problem is really interesting to you and you feel like the approach that you're taking is fruitful.</p>
</details>

除非你了解到新的证据，可能需要改变你的方法，那么你就需要这样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Unless you learn, you know, there's some new evidence comes in that maybe you need to change your approach, then you need to do that.</p>
</details>

但如果你对问题深感兴趣，那就不算是真正的挫折。那更像是一种学习。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But then that's not really, if you're deeply interested in the problem, that's not really a setback. That's more of a learning.</p>
</details>

真正的挫折是永远做错事，做不正确的事。那才是挫折。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The setback would be doing the wrong thing, doing the incorrect thing forever. That's a setback.</p>
</details>

但一开始做错了，然后获得了新的证据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But doing the incorrect thing at first, then acquiring some evidence.</p>
</details>

也许，从公司建设的角度来看，你可能对产品应该是什么样子有一个想法。你把它展示给客户，结果他们从中发现了你没有想到的其他有价值的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Maybe, you know, from a company building perspective, it might be that you have an idea for what a product might look like. you show it to customers and then it turns out that they find something else valuable in it that you didn't think about.</p>
</details>

有些人认为那是一种挫折，但实际上你希望加速达到那个结果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Some people consider that a setback, but that's actually you want to accelerate your time to that event.</p>
</details>

如果你觉得没有经历过这种挫折，那么你可能就没有取得进展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Like if you don't feel like you have like these sorts of setbacks, then you're probably not making progress.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为重要的是要深深地关心你正在与他人一起做的事情，并且要不断行动，取得进展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so I think the important thing is to deeply care about what you're working on with the people that you're doing it with and be making and sort of have momentum like taking action and making progress.</p>
</details>

所以，当我回顾过去一年时，从这个意义上说，我并没有真正看到任何挫折。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so when I look at the past year, I don't really in in that sense like I I don't really see any setbacks like there were there's new information that was learned that change direction for us research and product.</p>
</details>

我们学到了新的信息，改变了我们研究和产品的方向。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There are you know always setbacks in terms of you know maybe someone a really good candidate not really wanting to join.</p>
</details>

当然总会有挫折，比如一个非常优秀的候选人可能不想加入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But you kind of have to take the aggregate view of like what is the sort of general vector that you're going on.</p>
</details>

但你必须从整体上看待你正在前进的总体方向。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Are you learning things constantly? Are you in aggregate hiring really good people even if some of them aren't converting?</p>
</details>

你是否在不断学习？即使有些优秀人才没有最终加入，你是否总体上仍在招聘优秀人才？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">As long as there's that kind of momentum there, I think that setbacks don't really affect not necessarily just myself, but I think the setback doesn't feel as painful when you have kind of clarity of what you're pursuing.</p>
</details>

只要有这种势头存在，我认为挫折就不会真正影响到我个人，而且当你对所追求的目标有清晰认识时，挫折感也不会那么痛苦。

### 成功的秘诀：与优秀的人为伍

如果我给年轻时的自己，或者我的两个妹妹一些建议，那会是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If I was giving advice to my younger self or you know I have two younger sisters as well.

</details>

人们可能会给出关于选择正确的事情、追随激情之类的建议。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But something that is underappreciated I think is sort of surrounding yourself with the right people.</p>
</details>

但我认为被低估的一点是，要与正确的人为伍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So if you have an internal kind of vector of interest you want to do something that like things that are impactful interesting to you.</p>
</details>

所以，如果你内心有一个兴趣方向，你想做一些对你有影响力、有趣的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But so long as you have that in the same way that it's important in your personal life to surround yourself with very highquality friends.</p>
</details>

但只要你拥有这种兴趣，就像在个人生活中与高质量的朋友为伴很重要一样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the most kind of when I when I look at how sort of my last decade has played out, the thing that has been most impactful to me was surrounding myself with right people who at that time maybe would have taken a chance on me like for example in in Berkeley I would say Peter Aiel when took me in as a postto lab I was a physicist I was not an AI person and AI was very competitive then but by being in that lab and surrounding myself with people like him and his PhD students that's what really enabled me to learn quickly and develop my thinking.</p>
</details>

我认为，当我回顾过去十年时，对我影响最大的事情是与正确的人为伍，那些当时可能愿意给我机会的人。例如，在伯克利，**彼得·阿比尔**（Peter Abbeel: 伯克利大学的AI教授）接纳我进入他的博士后实验室时，我是一名物理学家，而不是AI专业人士，而当时AI领域竞争非常激烈。但正是在那个实验室，与他以及他的博士生们在一起，才真正让我能够快速学习并发展我的思维。

<p class="english-text">I think often times a function of your what you're able to achieve is really who are the people who you're spending your time with.</p>
</details>

我认为，你所能取得的成就，往往取决于你与什么样的人共度时光。

<details>

</details>

非常有才华、有抱负的人通常也乐于回馈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, it's of course hard to get in front of them and so it's not like I think just sending a cold email is not enough.</p>
</details>

当然，现在很难接触到他们，所以仅仅发送一封陌生邮件是不够的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You have to really demonstrate that you really want something badly and demonstrate it through not just words but actions.</p>
</details>

你必须真正证明你非常渴望某事，并且不仅仅通过言语，还要通过行动来证明。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>

就我而言，我花了几个月时间去做了研究。我自学了强化学习，完成了一个研究项目。我有一些清晰具体的东西可以拿出来讨论并征求大家的反馈。

</details>

但我认为，只要你具备这种特质，即你坚持不懈，能够通过行动而非言语来表达你对某事的热情，这对于一个人来说是非常罕见的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">People who have been successful in whatever industry that might care about, I think, will look positively on that.</p>
</details>

我认为，无论在哪个行业取得成功的人，都会对此持积极态度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there's a sort of I think you can get into almost any door that you want with sufficient effort and it's just really important to surround yourself with the right people to enable you.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为只要付出足够的努力，你几乎可以敲开任何你想进入的大门，而与正确的人为伍来帮助你，这一点真的非常重要。
