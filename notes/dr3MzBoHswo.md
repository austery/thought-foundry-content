### 中国稀土主导与美国困境

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: 我认为我们确实面临着国家紧急状态。当然，政策制定者和公司都明白，当中国切断供应时会发生什么。所以，那是一个关键时刻，我认为那一刻真正让我们意识到，我们不仅过度依赖，而且是高达100%的依赖。我的意思是，中国切断了他们自己开发的精炼和提取技术。事实上，在我们暂停了一年的时候，**美国对外关系委员会**的合作伙伴**Silverado Policy Accelerator**做了大量工作，研究了中国在去年10月解除出口管制后实际出口了什么。他们出口磁铁，但他们不出口我们自己生产稀土所需的稀土或相关技术。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: So I think we actually do have a national emergency. And certainly, you know, policymakers and companies understand that when China shut off access. And so, you know, that was the moment. I think that was the moment where it really hit that that not only overreliance, but an up to 100% reliance that's like that. I mean, the Chinese cut off access to the technology that they had developed for refining, for extracting. They actually, when we had that one year pause, one of the things that, that the **Council on Foreign Relations** partner, **Silverado Policy Accelerator**, they had done a lot of work on what the, what China was actually exporting after, after that October lifting of the, of the, export controls there, exporting, magnets. But they're not exporting those rare earths or the technology that we need to actually, produce the same for ourselves.

**Joe Weisenthal**: 大家好，欢迎收听**Odd Lots Podcast**的又一期节目。我是**Joe Weisenthal**。我是**Tracy Alloway**。**Tracy**，我们做过很多期关于中国在某些技术领域被认为领先于美国的节目。它们都非常有趣，我学到了很多。但对我来说，这些节目有什么教训或意义并不明显。有些事情我们确实落后很多，我认为我们可能永远也追不上了。这很有趣，也很学术。但讨论这些到底有什么意义呢？我不知道这些信息有什么用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Hello, and welcome to another episode of the **Odd Lots Podcast**. I'm **Joe Weisenthal** and I'm **Tracy Alloway**. **Tracy**, you know, we do this episode on various areas of technology in which China is perceived to be ahead of the US. And they're very interesting and I learn a lot. It's not obvious to me like what lessons there are or anything. Some of there's some of these things it's like we're really far behind. I don't think we're ever going to catch up. This is very interesting and academic. But what exactly is the point of talking about all this? I don't know if there's anything to do with this information.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 我以为你会说，我们有时被指责在播客中指出战略**瓶颈**或困难领域，然后却完全不提供解决方案。我第一个承认我没有解决方案。如果有人指责我没有提供任何解决方案，我只会说那不是我的工作。我只是一个普通的播客主持人，我只是提出问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: You know, what I thought you were going to say is that we are sometimes accused of identifying strategic choke points or areas of difficulty on the podcast, and then coming up with absolutely no solutions for how to fix them. I will be the first to admit I have no solutions. If someone accuses me or I'm saying you have not offered any solutions, you know, I, I just say that's not my job. I'm just a mere podcaster. I'm just asking questions.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我们阐述问题，然后留给别人去解决。我们把问题留给别人去解决。但是，你知道，有些人不仅仅是在识别**瓶颈**。有些人正在识别领域和脆弱性。所以人们实际上正在思考解决方案。它们并非都是空中楼阁。我在**Twitter**上看到有人说：“哦，我知道如何更像中国人。”“我们为什么不尝试更像……”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: We enunciate the problem and leave it to others to figure out. We leave it. We leave the problem to others to figure out. But, you know, there are there are people who are doing more than identifying choke points. There are people who are identifying, areas and vulnerabilities, etc.. So people actually are thinking about solutions. They're not all pie in the sky. You know, I've seen people on **Twitter**, it's like, oh, I know how to sort of, be more like, Chinese. And, you know, why don't we just try to be more.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 你在**Twitter**上看到有人讨论如何更像中国人？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: You've seen people on **Twitter** about how to be more Chinese.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的，有一个中国笑话，他们只是说：“为什么美国不采纳具有中国特色的马克思列宁主义呢？”这真的是……不，然后我们就可以做到。严肃地说，你最常看到的是：“为什么美国不像中国那样放松一些监管，以便快速完成事情？”这就是诀窍。花更多的钱，或者鼓励参与者追求不那么短期的事情。是的，理论上存在解决方案。无论如何，让我们进行一次对话，真正讨论一些可能在可行范围内的想法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah. There is a Chinese joke. They just say, why don't you? Why doesn't the U.S. just adopt, Marxism-Leninism with Chinese characteristics? It's really that. Well, no. And then we can do that. On a serious note, the one you see most often is, well, why doesn't the U.S. just ease up on some of its regulation, like China, in order to get things done quickly? That's the trick. Spend more money or something like that. Encourage actors to pursue things that aren't necessarily so short term, etc.. Yes, there are in theory, solution. Anyway, let's have a conversation which we actually talk about ideas that may be somewhere in the realm of, feasible.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 太棒了，我准备好了。这还是一个有趣的话题，在**Odd Lots**节目中已经多次出现。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Excellent. I'm ready. And this is also this is on an interesting topic that's come up a number of times on **Odd Lots** at this point.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 没错。所以我们要讨论一个非常核心的话题。当然，这就是美国对战略矿产、稀土等的脆弱性，我们知道中国主导了这些领域，如果中国完全切断供应，那么不仅仅是军事、高科技等领域，所有方面都会出现各种问题。那么我们能做些什么来缓解这种脆弱性呢？中国的主导地位也是中美贸易谈判的一个关键转折点。而且我认为，从每天似乎都会出现的头条新闻中，你可以感受到美国方面的一种，我不想说是绝望，但也许是一种紧迫感，比如“哦，我们在犹他州发现了一个巨大的关键矿产矿床！”所以，我们都得救了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: That's right. So we're going to be talking about a very core topic. And of course this is US vulnerability to sort of strategic minerals rare earths etc., which we know that China dominated, which in theory of China were to completely shut off access. You know, not just military, high tech, etc. all kinds of problems. So what do we actually what could actually be done to alleviate this vulnerability? We really do have the and China's dominance was also a crucial turning point in the trade negotiations with the US. And also I think you get a sense of I don't want to say desperation on the US side, but like maybe urgency on the US side just by looking at the headlines that seem to come out on a nearly daily basis about like, oh, we found a huge critical mineral deposit in Utah. So, you know, we're all saved.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 值得注意的是，在我们深入探讨之前，这个领域从上一届政府到本届政府可能存在相当多的重叠。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: It's also worth noting, before we go further, this is an area in which there's probably a decent amount of overlap from the last administration to this one.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的，我们前段时间和**Peter Harrell**做了一期节目。他谈到了本届政府正在与私营公司进行股权投资的一些交易。我认为**Vulcan**就是其中之一。所以，是的，我们将讨论我们如何在拥有健康、强大的国内战略商品环境方面走得更远。无论如何，我们确实请到了最完美的嘉宾。我们将与**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**对话。她是**美国对外关系委员会**的高级研究员，曾任美国国务院首席经济学家。她也是**CFR**一份全新报告的合著者。这份报告正是探讨这个问题：美国在这个领域能做些什么？所以，**Heidi**，非常感谢你来参加**Odd Lots**节目。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah, we did an episode, a little while ago with **Peter Harrell**. Who talked about some of these deals that the administration is making with equity stakes in private companies. I think **Vulcan** came up as one of them. And so, yes, we're going to be talking about what we're further, we can go in terms of actually having a healthy, robust domestic, domestic environment for our own strategic commodities, etc.. Anyway, we really do have the perfect guest. We're going to be speaking with **Heidi Crebo-Rediker**. She's a senior fellow at the **Council on Foreign Relations**, a former chief economist at the State Department. And she is the coauthor of a brand new report for the **CFR**. Looking at exactly this question, what can the US do in this room? So, **Heidi**, thank you so much for coming on the ad. Last part.

</details>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: 谢谢邀请我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: Thanks for having me on.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 告诉我们，这份新报告是关于什么的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Tell us what is, what's this new report all about?

</details>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: 你说得对，每个人都发现了问题，而且，我的意思是，这个问题已经酝酿了很长时间。几十年来，它就像一辆慢火车向我们驶来。现在中国主导这个市场并不令人意外，原因有很多。他们将其武器化也不令人意外。多年来他们一直这样做。我们确实关注过，但在很多方面我们又忘记了。但现在我们正处于一个转折点，我们真的需要把这把达摩克利斯之剑从美国头上移开。实际上，我们面临的挑战与许多其他发达经济体现在面临的挑战相同，即这种令人难以置信的**扼制**，不仅针对关键矿产，特别是稀土，尤其是重稀土，它们是磁铁的基础，而磁铁无处不在。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: So so you're right that everyone's identified the problem and that, I mean, it's been a long time coming. This is like a slow train coming at us for for decades. At this point, it's not a surprise that China, has dominated this market for a variety of reasons. And it's not a surprise that they've weaponized it. They've done it over the years. We did pay attention, but we sort of forgot about it, in many ways. But right now we have an inflection point where we really need to get this sort of Damocles off of, off of the United States. And actually, it's it's really we our challenge is the same challenge that a lot of other advanced economies have right now with this incredible chokehold, not just on critical minerals, but particularly rare earths, particularly heavy rare earths that are the foundation of magnets which go in everything.

</details>

### 中国稀土产业的崛起

**Tracy Alloway**: 我能回顾一下历史吗？因为我认为这有助于我们理解我们现在所处的位置。是什么条件让中国基本上在这个特定领域获得了主导地位？他们是否在某个时候做出了战略决策，说：“我们要成为世界的稀有矿产和稀土的制造商，我们要把这作为我们自己的优先事项。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Can I, just back up in history for a second? Because I think it will help us contextualize where we are right now. But what were the conditions that allowed China to basically gain dominance in this particular area? Did they make a strategic decision at some point saying, you know, we're going to be the world's, not manufacturer of, of rare minerals and rare earths, but we're going to we're going to make this, you know, a priority for ourselves.

</details>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: 是的，**“中国制造2025”**是他们重要的战略计划。他们很早以前就在稀土领域投入了大量资金，尤其是国内稀土。但他们决定要主导这个市场。他们非常聪明地创建了一个完整的生态系统。包括国内的中国提取、加工，然后他们开发了所有将成为主要需求的产品，这对于创建市场至关重要。这些需求包括新能源、风力涡轮机，特别是他们的电动汽车和国防。所以你有一个完整的需求池，而且你还有不需要盈利的国有企业。如果你在全球范围内竞争采矿和加工，这一点非常关键。他们还掌握了大量的加工技术。所以在传统采矿业中，他们确实进行了大规模的战略投资。而我们由于各种原因没有这样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: Yes. **Made in 2025**, was their big strategic plan. They had invested a lot in, in rare earths, you know, particularly their domestic rare earths, to like many, many years before that. But they decided they wanted to dominate. And they really they did a very smart job of creating an entire ecosystem. So both domestic China extraction, processing and then they came up with the all of the products that were that would be the leading demand, which you really need to have for the creation of a market and the demand meaning the, you know, new energy, wind turbines, particularly their, you know, their, their EVs and also defense. So you have a whole like, demand pool and you also have state companies that don't have to be profitable. And that's pretty key if you're competing over on the globe to, to actually mine and process. They also have a lot of hold on the technology for processing. And so in traditional mining, you know, they've really they've made a massive strategic investment. And we for a variety of reasons did not.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: **Joe**，这让我想起了我们和**Dan Wang**做的那期节目，他提出了关于深圳周边技术生态系统如何发展，以及这如何让创新真正蓬勃发展的类似观点。还有这种想法，如果你不像美国那样关心资本回报，那么在开发像这样可能长期没有回报的东西时，你就占据了优势。这似乎总是一个问题，当我们谈论一些国防事务时，因为在国家安全方面，你还有另一个与利润无关的优先事项。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: **Joe**, this reminds me of the episode we did with **Dan Wang**, where he made sort of similar points about the tech ecosystem that's developed around Shenzhen and how that, like, allows innovation to really thrive. And then also this idea that, well, if you don't necessarily care about returns on capital as much as the US, certainly then you kind of have a leg up when you're developing something like this that might not pay off for a very long time. And this always seems to be an issue when we're talking about some matters of national defense, because right when it comes to national security, you have this other priority that is not profit related.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我们做的每一期节目，只要谈到国防工业、国防供应商或其他战略性事物，都会出现这个问题。在这里，你还有另一个目标，那就是利润不能是唯一的考量。你至少有两条底线，一条与安全有关，一条与利润有关。所以你存在这种紧张关系。那么你是如何完成这份报告的？你研究这个的过程是怎样的？你和谁谈过等等，以便你能发表这份报告。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Everything that we've done that has some every episode we've talked about, this comes up with we're talking about literally the defense industry is and the defense suppliers or other strategic things. Here is there's other goal that you have in which profit can't be the only you have at least two bottom lines. One is related to security and one's related to profit. And so you have this tension. So how did you do this report. What was the process by which this was, you researched this, who did you talk to etc., so that you could, publish this.

</details>

### 创新策略与报告方法

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: 我的意思是，这份报告本身是关于我们如何将所有重点放在采矿、提取、加工和最终产品（例如磁铁）上。问题是，我们实际上无法在采矿、加工和支出上超越中国。当然，无法大规模地、以成本效益高的方式做到。那么还有什么办法呢？我们基本上存在巨大的时间错配。我们最终会和朋友、盟友以及所有正在共同解决这个问题的国家一起实现目标。但这将需要很长时间，而我们真的没有时间。所以我们研究了创新如何能够真正**跨越**中国对关键矿产，特别是稀土的**扼制**。所以这真的是起点。你如何以一种真正发挥美国创新优势的方式来解决国家和经济安全问题？然后当我们环顾四周时，我们发现有一些非常令人兴奋的公司，他们将15年前的研发成果付诸实践，并准备好进行规模化生产，而且已经开始规模化。所以这真的是令人兴奋的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: So the I mean, the report itself is on how well we put all of the emphasis on, on mining, on the extraction coming up with the processing and the, the end products, for example, magnets. The the thing is, we can't actually out mine out process and outspend China. Certainly not at scale and not in a cost effective way. So what is another? We have basically a huge timing mismatch. Will we get there eventually with friends, allies, you know, all of the different countries that are working on this same problem together eventually. But it's going to take a very long time and we don't really have time. So we looked at how innovation could actually, leapfrog the China choke hold on critical minerals and particularly rare earths. And so that was really the starting point. How do you solve for national and economic security in a way that really plays to U.S. strengths in innovation? And, and then when we took a look around, we found there were some really exciting companies that had taken research and development from like 15 years ago, and they were ready to scale and starting to scale. And so that was really what the excitement was about.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 很快地问一下，你说“环顾四周”，你是如何识别这些人的？你和谁谈过？你是如何识别那些向你指出“看，有很多有趣的、真正的科学技术可以规模化”的人的？这个过程是如何运作的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Just real quickly, what do you say you took a look around like what was the how did you sort of identify the people? Like who did you talk to and how did you identify the people who pointed you to? Look, there was a lot of interesting, genuine science and tech that can be, scaled up. How did that process work?

</details>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: 我从**国家实验室**开始，因为我们没有充分肯定这样一个事实：许多我们都知道和喜爱的伟大创新，实际上都起源于我们的**国家实验室**系统，它们是国家的瑰宝。所以**艾姆斯国家实验室**（**Ames National Lab**）有一个关键材料创新中心。许多正在从事各种突破性技术的公司都源于**艾姆斯国家实验室**，或者正在与它合作。所以我从那里开始摸索，然后主要是口耳相传。所以一旦我们放出消息说我们正在研究这个，这是一个非常热情、使命驱动的社区，他们都希望通过创新来**跨越**这个挑战。此外，人们喜欢谈论他们的问题，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: So I started with the **national labs** because we we don't give enough credit to the fact that a lot of the great innovations that come out in are commercialized, that we all, we all know and love actually had their origin in our **national lab** system. And sort of a national jewel. And so **Ames National Lab** has this critical material innovation hub. And a lot of the companies that are doing this, like the various types of breakthrough technology came out of or are working with **Ames National Lab**. And so I started like poking around from there and then really word of mouth. So as soon as as soon as we got the word out that we were working on this, it's a it's a very enthusiastic, mission driven community that wants to all leapfrog this challenge through innovation. Plus, people like talking about their problems. Right.

</details>

### 美国稀土产业现状与创新机遇

**Tracy Alloway**: 请描述一下美国目前稀土产业的状况。另外，你认为在这个特定的战略**瓶颈**中，关键的**扼制点**是什么？最大的问题来源或无法大规模生产的原因是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Describe for us the state of the US, I guess rare earths industry at the moment. And then also what you would describe as the key choke point in this particular strategic choke point, like where is the biggest source of trouble or inability to actually do this at scale?

</details>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: 就此而言，有两个不同的部分。美国过去在**芒廷山口矿**（**Mountain Pass mine**）生产大量的稀土，主要是轻稀土和P材料，该矿面临各种挑战，包括商业上不可行。但这并不是唯一的原因。但美国确实拥有稀土资源。我们很多年前曾是采矿大国。我的意思是，还记得加州的淘金者们拿着锄头和铲子出去淘金吗？是的，很多很多年前。所以我们确实有矿山和资源。但总是存在后果和权衡。采矿通常有毒。你面临环境问题。传统采矿会产生大量废弃物。所以我们非常乐意让中国人承担这些问题，然后以非常低的成本卖给我们。这就是我们都变得依赖他们的方式。所以，我认为这就是我们现在所处的位置。我们确实正在形成许多合作伙伴关系。与沙特、韩国、澳大利亚。我的意思是，我们正在尽力走传统的采矿路线。但我认为真正有趣的是，我们如何通过一些新技术，以更快、更清洁、更具成本效益的方式，甚至在成本上与中国竞争，在美国进行采矿。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: So in terms of the there are two different parts the U.S. used to produce, a significant amount of of rare earths, primarily light rare earths and p materials, in **Mountain Pass mine**, had, you know, a variety of challenges, including not being commercially viable. But that was not the only reason. But we do actually have rare earths in the United States. And we and we were a mining, you know, a mining powerhouse many years ago. I mean, remember like California 49 ers and people going out with picks and shovels. Yeah, many, many years, many years ago. So we do have mines and we have resources. But there are always, you know, there are always consequences and trade offs there. You know to mine is often toxic. You have environmental concerns. You have a lot of waste that through traditional mining gets generated. So we were more than happy for the Chinese to take on that, those set of problems and then sell them to us at a very low cost. That's how we all became dependent on them. And, and so that is, I think where we are right now, we do have a lot of partnerships that are being formed. And, you know, with Saudi with, South Korea, there are Australia. I mean, we're sort of doing what we can to go the traditional mining route. But the I think the really interesting thing is how we can get there, like much faster, much cleaner, and with much more cost effectiveness and even competitiveness, cost competitiveness with China through some of these new technologies, mining in the US.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 让我们谈谈当你提到那些能让我们达到同等水平的技术时。它们更多地是在采矿方面，还是更多地在精炼方面，或者两者兼有？让我们谈谈这些技术。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Let's talk about, when we when you talk about the technologies that could actually get us to parity or something like that. Are they more on the mining side? Are they more on the refining side or both? Like, let's talk about these technologies.

</details>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: 好的。我给你举几个例子。2010年中国切断日本稀土供应时，**美国能源部**通过其**ARPA-E**（人们通常不知道**ARPA-E**，他们通常想到**DARPA**，但**能源部**有自己的研究资助机构，他们解决大问题并将其公之于众）。所以他们在2011年做了这件事。他们投入了大量研究资金，用于制造不需要稀土的磁铁材料。结果，明尼苏达州的一家公司，**明尼苏达大学**的一位科学家，制造出了一种**无稀土磁铁**。所以这是一种材料设计方法，可以大幅减少磁铁中所需的稀土量。有一家名为**Nylon Magnetics**的公司，它已经商业化并正在扩大规模。它正在明尼苏达州大规模扩建新设施。所以这是一种材料工程方法。然后还有另一整套**生物技术创新**。如果你想让我深入讲解，请说。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: Okay. So let me give you let me give you a couple of examples. So back when China cut off Japan's rare earth access in 2010, the **Department of Energy**, through its, I mean, people don't know **Arpa-E**. Generally they think of **DARPA**, but but **Department of Energy** has its own research. Grant facility, and they do big problems and put them out there. So they did this in 2011. They sprinkled around a lot of grant research funding for materials that you could create a magnet with. It did not require rare earths. And lo and behold, the company in Minnesota, a scientist in Minnesota, **University of Minnesota**, created a rare earth free magnet. So there's a material design approach to this that either drastically reduces how much rare earths you actually need in magnets. And there's a company, called **Nylon Magnetics** that actually is it's commercialized, it's scaling. It actually is is, you know, scaling up massively a new facility in Minnesota. So that's sort of the material engineering approach to it. And then there's this whole other basket of, of biotech, innovations. And you know, if you want me to go into this, please.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah.

</details>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: 好的。所以，有一些公司，比如**Alter Research Technology**，它们也与**艾姆斯国家实验室**合作。它们已经编程了蛋白质。这些蛋白质基本上就像机器人一样，进入废弃物中。稍后我们会谈到废弃物的重要性。但它们会进入废弃物或其他类型的尾矿，即矿山产生的物质，并专门针对特定的稀土进行提取。所以它是清洁、快速的。它依赖于我们拥有的大量资源。我们有很多废弃物。所以它是一种国内来源的资源。还有许多其他方式，我们正在以非常清洁、快速且具有成本竞争力的方式，利用技术来实际开采废弃物。这实际上是我们的一个优势，我们不应该再将废弃物视为一种负债。它简直就是“美国的下一座矿山”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: Okay. So so, you know, there are companies like, **Alter Research Technology** and they again, are affiliated with this **Ames National Lab**. They, they have programed proteins. So those proteins are, are basically like, like robots that go in to waste. And they'll get to, to sort of the importance of waste in a minute. But they will go into waste or other types of, of tailings, things that come out of, of mines. And they will go in and specifically target the protein, will target a specific rare earth and extract it. And so it is clean, it's fast. It relies on, on a very large resource that we have. We have a lot of waste. So it's a domestic, you know, it's a domestically sourced, resource. There are a number of other, you know, ways that we are very in a very clean, fast and cost competitive way using technology to actually mine waste. And, and that's actually one of our it's like we we shouldn't consider waste at this point to be a liability. It's literally America's next mine.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我有一个严肃的问题。但首先，你先知道了吗？首先，我非常好奇那个小小的**蛋白质机器人**。那个过程实际上是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: So I have a serious question. But first, did you first know? First, I'm so curious about the little protein robot. So what does that process actually look like?

</details>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: 我不知道，我不是分子技术专家，正在听节目的分子技术专家们，那将是后续的节目。但这是已经酝酿了很久的技术。所以基本上，这家公司正在将这项技术商业化，但它是一种经过改造的蛋白质，可以进入并微观靶向特定的稀土元素。我认为这有点革命性，非常具有颠覆性。所有参与我们这项研究的公司也都一样，它们正处于准备好快速扩大规模的边缘。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: So I don't know what the I, I don't know, I'm not a I'm not a molecular, you know, technologist and and molecular technologists out there listening. That'll be the follow up episode. But there but this is something that's been again, long in the making in terms of, of the tech that's been developed. And so it's basically you, you know, that this particular company is commercializing the technology, but it is, it's a protein that is altered so that it can go in and sort of micro target specific rare earth elements. And that is I think it's kind of revolutionary. It's super disruptive. And the same with all of these companies that were part of this, this study that we did, they are at the they are at the cusp of being ready to scale and scale fast.

</details>

### 政策挑战与规模化

**Joe Weisenthal**: 好的。这是我的下一个严肃问题：所有这些听起来都很棒。**蛋白质机器人**听起来很神奇。如果技术已经存在，我们为什么还没有这样做呢？

**Joe Weisenthal**: All right. This is my next serious question, which is, you know, all of this sounds great. Protein robots sounds amazing. Why aren't we doing this already? If the technology exists.

</details>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: 所以我们关注的是，这需要一个专注于创新方面的战略。我们非常专注于如何与传统采矿业正面竞争。这很好，也很重要。这是一个巨大的补充。我们还没有真正做到这一点。我们是零敲碎打地做的。所以这个社区里有很多人高度专注于技术，早期商业化，然后想办法从那里发展。我认为我们又有一个巨大的机会。当我思考我们现在所处的位置时，我想到了**页岩革命**，以及我们拥有**水力压裂技术**几十年了。然后我们达到了一个临界点，这项技术在美国引发了一场能源革命。这就像一夜之间开关被打开了。突然之间，我们成为了一个能源巨头，一个能源生产巨头。所以我确实觉得我们现在在关键矿产和稀土技术领域看到的情况有相似之处。我认为我们真的需要一个大开关被打开，突然拥有丰富的资源，尽管这种情况不常发生。我们应该让人们更多地认识到这一点。

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: So we're focused on and this is, you know, this this takes a, a strategy and a and a strategy that focuses on the innovation side. We're very focused on the how do we compete head on with traditional mining. And that's good. And it's important. This is a huge complement to that. We haven't really done it yet. We've done it piecemeal. So you have a lot of a lot of people in this community that are highly focused on the technology, commercializing it early stage and then figuring out how to go from there. The, I think we have, again, it's a huge opportunity that's out there. When I think about where we are, I think about the **shale revolution** and how we had **fracking technology** for, for like decades. And then we reached a point where that technology unlocked an energy revolution in the United States. And it was like an overnight switch flipped. And suddenly we're an energy giant, an energy producing giant. And so I do feel there's something similar in what we're seeing right now in the technology around critical minerals and rare earths. I think we could really use a big switch flipped to suddenly have abundant, though those doesn't come along very often. We should have, people have to appreciate that more.

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我正在读**伯克利**（**Berkeley**）发布的一份新闻稿，发表在《**纳米快报**》（**Nano Letters**）上。研究人员基因改造了一种无害病毒，使其像智能海绵一样，从水中吸附稀土矿物、稀土金属，并通过温度和酸度的轻微变化，释放它们进行收集。听起来真的很酷。我稍后得去看看**YouTube**视频。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: I'm reading this press release from **Berkeley**. As reported in **Nano Letters**. The researchers genetically engineered a harmless virus to act like a smart sponge that grabs rare earth minerals, rare earth metals from water and with a gentle change in temperature and acidity, releases them for collection. Sounds really cool. I have to go, watch a **YouTube** later.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 告诉我们，在许多这些对话中出现的一个主题是**承购协议**的重要性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Talk to us about, one of the themes that it comes up in a lot of these conversations is the importance of offtake agreement.

</details>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: 是的。所以，现在美国公司确实可以获得中国的稀土。因此，对于任何投资这些技术的人来说，这可能非常冒险，因为至少在最初几年，在成本曲线下降之前，竞争对手可能更便宜。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: Yeah. So, right, like, right now we can, American companies, they currently do have access to Chinese rare earths. And so it may might be very risky for anyone to invest in these technologies, knowing that at least for the very, you know, the beginning years went before the cost curve has come down. The, competitors might be cheaper.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 俗称的“死亡之谷”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: The proverbial valley of death.

</details>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: Yeah.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 你如何解决这个问题，即保证当这些公司释放像智能海绵一样从水中吸附稀土金属的无害病毒时，会有需求？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: How do you solve that problem? Of guaranteeing that there is demand for when these companies, release harmless viruses that act like a smart sponge. Incredibly rare earth metals from water.

</details>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: 所以首先，这不仅仅是政府要做的事情。我的意思是，很多人都指出**特朗普政府**现在正在使用的大规模、非常强硬的**产业政策**。我认为那是一件非常好的事情。但它也需要公司以**企业联合体**的形式更多地合作，以达成集体**承购协议**。有些公司在与某些供应商的**承购协议**方面非常积极。我的意思是，**Niron Magnetics**就是一个很好的例子，他们有一些汽车原始设备制造商（OEM）已经与他们合作多年了。你之前提到了**Vulcan**，但**Vulcan**是当技术、**产业政策**和商业全部协同工作以解决问题时的典范。他们实际上是第一个创新导向的**产业政策**规模化、快速规模化的例子。**Vulcan**只有三年历史。他们在八月份完成了A轮融资。我的意思是，我们谈论的是他们与一家名为**ReElement**的回收磁铁公司合作，在一个**企业联合体**中获得了**14亿美元**。他们提取稀土并实际制造磁铁。这非常有趣。他们正在以超快的规模化时间表进行这项工作。我认为他们的目标是在2027年开始推出产品，并且一直在对其各种类型的磁铁进行验证过程。所以他们正在加速进行。他们获得了军队所有分支的资助。所以他们有美国军方内置的供应需求。他们还有半导体和航空航天领域的合作伙伴。他们真正希望解决国家安全和最重要的经济安全挑战。他们有合作伙伴来做到这一点。所以我认为这是一个很好的例子，说明我们希望如何向前发展。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: So first, there has to be. This is not just on government to do. I mean, a lot of people point at the massive, you know, very muscular industrial policy that the **Trump administration** is using right now. And I think that that is that is a very good thing. But it also takes, it takes companies actually coming together more in a consortia, type of arrangement to have collective offtake agreements. You have certain companies that have been very forward leaning in their offtake agreements with certain, I mean, **Niran Magnetics** is a good case that, that they have some auto, OEMs that have been working with them for, for years now. You have been **Vulcan**, you brought up earlier, but **Vulcan** is kind of the poster child for when you get the technology, the industrial policy and the commercial all together working, to, to solve. And and they actually are I think they're the first innovation, targeted, industrial policy scale up, rapid scale up. **Vulcan**'s only three years old. They they closed their Series A in August. I mean, we're talking about **1.4 billion** that they got in a, in a, in a, consortium together with a company called **ReElement** that recycles magnets. They take the rare earths and they actually manufacture magnets. That is, that is incredibly interesting. They do it on a they're doing it on a, on a, like a super fast, scaling time, time horizon. I think they are aiming for 2027 to start rolling product out and have been going through the validation process with all of their, their different types of magnets. So they're doing this on an accelerated basis. They got funded by every branch in the military. So they have a built in supply, you know, a demand from the **US military** right there. They also have semiconductor and and aerospace. They're really looking to target the national security and the top economic security challenges. And they have the partners to do that. So I think that's a good example of how we want to do this moving forward.

### 废弃物：美国的下一座矿山

**Joe Weisenthal**: 除了承购问题之外，谁实际拥有我们可能从中提取有价值物质的废水？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Adjacent to the offtake issue, who actually owns the wastewater that we could potentially be, you know, extracting valuable things from.

</details>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: 所以我们有许多不同类型的废弃物。我们有煤灰，我们有仍在运营的矿山的尾矿，在那里他们提取了最有价值和易于提取的部分。然后他们有所有其他堆积在那里含有大量稀土的矿山尾矿。我们有一些真正有毒的区域，它们存在于池塘中，对供水造成很多问题。我们有大量的工业废弃物可以利用，这些废弃物来自提取初级金属的矿山。但你看到旁边堆积着尾矿，因为它们要么没有商业可行性来提取，要么它们只是被认为是废弃物堆，无论是正在运营的矿山还是已关闭的矿山。你有煤灰，那是煤矿开采后有毒的残留废弃物。你还有**电子垃圾**，我认为这是更有前景的领域之一。实际上，如果你看看旧硬盘、手机和电池等，里面含有大量的稀土，甚至还有磁铁，这些都是多年前的，当时这些磁铁中的稀土强度要大得多，在我们不得不缩减规模之前。所以如果你看看废弃物生态系统，我们有很多国内机会。这实际上就是为什么我认为**Vulcan**是一个很好的例子。他们从国内回收的**电子垃圾**中提取，然后在完全国内的循环中加工和制造磁铁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: So we have lots of different types of waste. So we have I mean, we have coal ash, we have tailings from mines that are still operating where they extract, like the the super valuable part of and the easy to extract. And then they have all the other mine tailings that just sit there that have a lot of for example, rare earths in them. They have we have, you know, we have some really, really toxic areas that, that are sitting in ponds and, and, you know, like giving a lot of problems to water supplies. And, we have a huge amount of, of waste that we can draw from, industrial waste that comes from, from mines where you have primary metals that are, that are extracted. But you have the piles of tailings that sit there on the side because they are either not, there's no commercial viability to extract them or they are, you know, they're just considered they're considered piles of waste, both in operating mines and in mines and closed down. You have coal ash that is, you know, sort of toxic leftover waste from from coal mining. You have **e-waste**, which is, I think, one of the more promising areas we actually, if you look at old, hard drives and cell phones and batteries and the like, there are tons of, of rare earths that are in there and actually magnets that are in there from years, you know, when, when we actually had much greater rare earths, you know, intensity in those magnets before we started to like, having to have to scale back. So if you look at the waste ecosystem, we have a lot of domestic, opportunity. And that's actually why I think **Vulcan** is a really good example. They pull from domestic recycled **e-waste** and then they process and manufacture magnets in a completely domestic cycle.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: **Joe**，煤灰很有趣。我本可以在康涅狄格州烧煤炉的第一年就从我的煤灰中开采稀土。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: **Joe**, that's interesting about coal ash. I could have, I could have been mining my ashes from burning the coal stove in Connecticut that first year, mining them for rare earths.

**Tracy Alloway**: 如果我没有又错过一个利用和货币化我的自然资源的机会。

### 政策制定与政府作用

**Joe Weisenthal**: 好的，我们明白了有各种措施、机会、资源和技术机会，以及在实验室中有效、正在扩大规模的事物。从政策角度来看，我们还需要做些什么才能从现有进展达到我们满意的状态？从政策角度来看，需要通过立法来实现，还是联邦政府目前就拥有足够的资金和政策杠杆，无需通过新法律就能推动？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Let's talk about, okay, so we understand there's various, measures and opportunities and resources and technological opportunities and things that work in the lab, things that are already us, scaling up, etc.. Talk to us more like from a policy perspective, what do we need to do to get from what we already have cooking in what's already in the works, to where we feel good about where we are and from this policy, what it need to happen in the form of legislation or does the government, the federal government as currently constituted, have the cash and the policy levers to pull without, new laws being passed?

</details>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: 政策发挥着巨大作用。我们首先需要做的是，认识到我们不能采取碎片化的方法，因为那样最终会失去可能完全改变与中国对抗格局的创新。你还必须从政策层面处理废弃物问题，因为我们实际上不追踪废弃物。很难找到关于美国产生多少**电子垃圾**的数据。我们将其中的一部分运往亚洲。这很可能又回流到中国的巨大回收机器中。我们不应该出口。如果你认为这是美国的下一座矿山，那么有办法制定政策，提供数据，也许限制出口，这样我们就能确切知道我们出口的所有东西中隐藏着什么价值。然后制定一个完整的战略，一个关键矿产创新战略，与我们其他的关键矿产战略并存，并通过围绕废弃物的政策工具以及金融工具来发展它。**死亡之谷**在哪里？我们如何找到它们？我们如何解决它们？我们如何利用政府作为一个门户，让公司和**企业联合体**尽早达成那些**承购协议**，并与材料工程师合作，在流程早期设计他们需要的东西。有很多好的方法可以做到这一点。一个重要的启示是，存在一个特定的股权**死亡之谷**，一个风险投资实体可以帮助解决这个问题，因为除了少数真正大的前沿风险承担者之外，你没有风险投资会投资于困难的技术。所以我认为拥有某种我们现在在**国防部**（**DoD**）拥有的工具，我们有一系列不同的机构，它们都基于贷款。它们几乎都是基于贷款的工具。但这不适用于这些科技公司，它们真的无法承受债务。它们还没有达到那个阶段。你需要风险投资尽早介入，并通过各种融资系列帮助它们。与其他人合作，在整个过程中引入其他私人风险投资。我们现在确实有一个这样的机构，那就是**In-Q-Tel**。它在技术上不是……我不知道你以前是否听说过**In-Q-Tel**，**中情局**（**CIA**）的血清。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: So policy plays an enormous role. And the the first thing we need to do is actually understand that we can't do a fragmented approach to this because you end up losing innovation that might actually change the the chessboard entirely. With China. You also have to deal with, with waste from a policy basis because we actually don't track waste. It's very hard to find data on how much **e-waste** the US produces. We ship some of it to Asia. That is very likely fed back into China's massive recycling machine. We shouldn't be exporting. If you if you consider this is America's next mine, there there are ways to address policy that can, you know, provide the data, maybe restrict the exports so we know exactly what value is hidden inside all of the stuff that we're exporting. And, and then come up with a whole like a whole strategy that is a critical minerals innovation strategy that sits alongside our other critical minerals strategy and develop that, through not only the policy tools around waste, but also financial tools. Where are the **valleys of death**? Where do we find them? How can we solve them? How can we use government as a, as a, a portal to get companies together and consortia to actually have those **offtake agreements** early on and also work with the material engineers to design what they're going to need earlier on in the process there. Like, there are a lot of good ways to do this. One of the big takeaways is that there is a specific equity **valley of death** that a venture like entity could help solve this for, because you don't have the venture outside of some really big frontier, you know, risk takers that will invest in, in difficult technology. So I think having some kind of, counter that we have now in the, you know, in the instruments that **DoD** has, you know, we have a whole range of different agencies that have all loan based. They're almost all loan based instruments. And that's not what this is like. These are tech companies and they really can't sustain debt. They're not there. You need to have that VC come in early on and help them through various series of fundraising. Partner with others, bring in other like private VCs throughout the process. And we need to and we do have one of those right now. That is **In-Q-Tel**. It is not technically, I don't know if you you've heard of **In-Q-Tel** before the **CIA**'s the serum.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的。好的，非常好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: It is. Okay. Very good.

</details>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: 他们实际上认识到资本结构中的这个缺口以及这些突破性技术融资的实际能力。所以他们实际上在**In-Q-Tel**内部创建了一个独立的基金，名为**Compass Fund**。他们不仅仅是**中情局**。他们是一个非营利组织。他们为所有情报机构工作，在过去25年中，他们从最初的模式发展壮大，最初他们只是一个精品风险投资公司，专门为情报界解决特定问题。所以他们进行了投资。实际上，回到你之前的一个问题，我是如何找到这些公司的？结果是他们投资了两家我通过**艾姆斯国家实验室**找到的公司。所以，我认为他们在思考实际存在的差距方面非常有帮助。我们确实抓住了政府需要提供这种早期风险投资的关键点。这是一种市场失灵，除非我们解决了这种市场失灵，否则这些技术将束之高阁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: And they they are actually they they recognize this gap in the capital structure and the actual ability for these, breakthrough technologies to fundraise. And so they actually created a separate fund within **In-Q-Tel** called their **Compass Fund**. And they're not just the it's not just the **CIA**. They're a nonprofit. They work for sort of across the intelligence agencies, and they've grown over the past 25 years from what they started out, which was really a very like a boutique VC for specific solving specific problems for the intelligence world. So they have invested. And actually going back to one of your earlier questions, how did I find these companies? Well, it ends up that they have invested they invested in two, companies that I had found through **Ames National Lab**. And so it was, I think they were extremely helpful and thinking through what the gaps actually were. And we really nailed this early stage, VC needing to come from government. It's a market failure until we have solve for that market failure, these will just lie on the shelf.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: **In-Q-Tel**的使命是成为美国政府及其盟友获取战略技术知识和能力的最复杂来源。这是通过资本实现的。这很有趣。我们应该做一期节目。我们当然应该做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: **In-Q-Tel** has one mission to be the most sophisticated source of strategic technical knowledge and capabilities to the U.S government and its allies. That's through capital. That's an interesting one. We should do an episode. We should have for sure.

</details>

### 历史借鉴与紧迫性

**Joe Weisenthal**: 好的，既然我们谈到了**中情局**，你之前提到了军队，这会是一个自然的过渡，我保证。你在报告中提到了一个历史类比，一个在历史上对美国军事上非常重要的**瓶颈**，我们实际上通过**产业政策**解决了它。这个特定的类比与我们当前的情况有多大的相关性？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Okay, so since we're talking about the **CIA** and you brought up the military earlier, this is going to be a natural segue, I promise. You bring up a historical analogy in your paper, a previous choke point that was militarily very, very significant for the US at a very, very historical time, which we actually managed to solve through industrial policy. How much relevance does that particular analogy have to our current situation?

</details>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: 我喜欢这个类比，因为在我们考虑参加二战时，日本人切断了东南亚天然橡胶的供应链，我们90%的橡胶都依赖这个供应。对吧？我们不能种植橡胶树，对吧？橡胶之所以来自东南亚是有原因的。我们所做的是，我们实际上采用了**合成橡胶技术**，并疯狂地扩大了它的规模。所以我们实际上能够为卡车、坦克以及所有需要橡胶的东西提供供应，而这些是我们以前从未想过的。但直到它消失了，如果我们无法提供替代橡胶供应的能力，我们就无法参加二战。所以我们通过“**快速行动**”（**Warp Speed**）、“**曼哈顿计划**”（**Manhattan Project**）式的努力做到了这一点。我的意思是，我们想到“**曼哈顿计划**”是为了原子弹。但同时，我认为有充分的理由认为，如果没有**合成橡胶**，我们不可能赢得二战。另一方面，我们做了一件大事，就是所有人都应该把他们多余的橡胶轮胎、雨衣和花园水管等所有能用于战争的东西都捐出来，这样我们就可以利用和回收我们已经拥有的橡胶。所以这是一个双管齐下的类比，我认为它很有效。二战时期有一些很棒的海报，关于回收轮胎之类的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: Well, I love this analogy because in, in as we were contemplating entering World War Two, the Japanese cut off the supply chain for natural rubber in Southeast Asia, and we were dependent on this flow for 90% of our rubber. Right. And we can't grow rubber trees, right? Rubber. Rubber came from Southeast Asia for a reason. And what we did was we actually, we took technology, **synthetic rubber** technology, and we scaled it like crazy. So we actually were able to, provide for, you know, for, for trucks and tanks and everything that rubber goes into that we had never even thought about. But until it was gone and we were not able to to actually enter World War Two without the ability to provide something in replacing that rubber supply. And so we did it both through a rapid **warp speed**, **Manhattan Project**. Like, I mean, we think of **Manhattan Project** for the for the atomic bomb. But at the same time, I think there's a good case to be made that without **synthetic rubber**, we would not have won World War Two. The the other side of that was that we did a huge, you know, all of the population should chuck in their extra rubber tires and their raincoats and their garden hoses and whatever you could for the war effort so that we could actually use and recycle, rubber that we had already here. So it's a two pronged, I think, analogy that works. There are some, great, like posters from World War two about recycling your tires and things like that.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 漂亮的平面设计。我有很多旧的**iPhone**之类的东西，可以随机回收稀土。我敢打赌我有十台旧笔记本电脑和各种杂物。而且，我的意思是，升级周期的方式，每个人都有大量的旧笔记本电脑，软件已经不能用了。所以这实际上是一个巨大的机会。所以如果我们能把它作为一个国家优先事项，并且有办法通过政府激励措施来做到这一点。我们可以通过公司支付旧的、未使用的、无法使用的技术等等，然后也许获得政府补贴。有很多方法可以发挥创意，让整个系统运转起来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Nice graphic design to find. Go. I have boxes of like old, so old **iPhones** and stuff, that randomly and recycle them for the rare earth. I bet I have like ten lab, ten old laptops and random stuff. And the way that, I mean, the way that the cycles of like, upgrades happened, I mean, everybody has tons of, like, old laptops where the software doesn't work anymore. And so this is actually a huge opportunity. So if we could, we could actually make it a national priority. And there are ways to do that through government incentives. You know, we can there ways that companies can do that through paying for old, you know, old unused, unusable, technologies and, and the like, and then have, maybe get a government credit there. Like a lot of ways you can be creative. Yeah. About getting this, this entire system to rev up.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 你刚才提到了“**快速行动**”，所以，显而易见地，**新冠疫苗**接种工作也浮现在脑海中。这些类型的项目能否在没有同时发生的国家紧急情况来激励所有人行动的情况下存在？我完全同意，与中国竞争是当今两党罕见的共识领域之一。但与此同时，稀土短缺、潜在的**瓶颈**是一个长期存在的问题。我们已经意识到了很长时间。到目前为止，我们并没有真正做太多。现在是什么会激励人们，真正赋予这项努力一种紧迫感？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: You mentioned **warp speed** just then. And so, you know, the obvious thing that comes to mind is also the vax, the **Covid vaccination** efforts. Can these types of programs exist without a coinciding national emergency to sort of galvanize everyone into action? And I totally take it that competing with China is one of those rare areas of bipartisan agreement nowadays. But at the same time, shortages, potential choke points in rare earths has been a long running issue. We've been aware of it for a while. So far, we haven't really done that much. What's going to galvanize people now and really lend this whole effort, a sense of urgency?

</details>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: 所以我认为我们确实面临着国家紧急状态。当然，政策制定者和公司都明白，当中国切断供应时会发生什么。所以，那是一个关键时刻，我认为那一刻真正让我们意识到，我们不仅过度依赖，而且是高达100%的依赖。我的意思是，中国人切断了他们开发的精炼和提取技术。事实上，在我们暂停了一年的时候，**美国对外关系委员会**的合作伙伴**Silverado Policy Accelerator**做了大量工作，研究了中国在去年10月解除出口管制后实际出口了什么。他们出口磁铁，但他们不出口我们自己生产稀土所需的稀土或相关技术。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: So I think we actually do have a national emergency. And certainly, you know, policymakers and companies understand that when China shut off access. And so you that was the moment I think that was the moment where it really hit that that not only overreliance, but up to 100% reliance that's like that. I mean, the Chinese cut off access to the technology that they had developed for refining, for extracting. They actually when we had that one year pause, one of the things that, that the **Council on Foreign Relations** partner, **Silverado Policy Accelerator**, they had done a lot of work on what the what China was actually exporting after, after that October lifting of the, of the, export controls. They're exporting, magnets, but they're not exporting those rare earths or the technology that we need to actually, produce the same for ourselves.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的，有趣的是，他们不出口稀土，他们出口成品材料，也就是最终组件。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah, it's interesting that, like, they won't export the rare earths, they'll export the finished material, which is the end component.

</details>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: 是的，是的。

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: Yeah.

**Joe Weisenthal**: 对。你正在为低利润、低利润的销售做这件事。你觉得，我提到过，从上一届政府到本届政府，在某些方面似乎存在一些连续性。当你身处华盛顿特区与人交谈时，你是否从政策方面或政府方面感受到一种强度和专注？因为，当你回顾二战时，我联想到那个时期的一件事就是，人们以令人难以置信的专注来协调解决具体问题。你觉得这种专注存在吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Right. And you're doing it for the low margin, the low margin sales. Do you feel like, you know, I mentioned it seems like there is some continuity on some of this stuff from the last administration to this one. Do you, when you're in DC talking to people, do you sense from the on the policy side or on the government side, do you feel that there is a sort of intensity and focus? Because again, when you, you know, you go back to World War Two, one thing I associate with that time is just an incredible amount of like focus on solving specific things in coordination. Do you sense that that exists?

</details>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: 就像二战一样，当时有很多官员指出我们过度依赖单一来源，或者当**瓶颈**是航运线路时，这里存在巨大的相似之处。在**拜登政府**时期，在最初的100天里，**拜登政府**做的第一件事就是进行了一项韧性研究，基本上考察了**瓶颈**在哪里。这是在**新冠疫情**之后。它考察了药品。它考察了。但一个重要的结论是，我们对中国的稀土和关键材料、关键矿产的依赖程度太高，我们必须尽快采取行动。**特朗普政府**和**特朗普**本人也明白我们在关键矿产方面存在巨大的脆弱性。他们通过了一些行政命令，并试图启动采矿、许可、减少许可时间、环境限制和时间表等整个过程。但我认为，这又是一个与二战前夕发生的事情完全相似的情况。我们实际上已经看到了这个问题很长时间了。直到中国切断供应，美国和欧洲才意识到这是一个大问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: So just as with World War Two, there were there were a lot of officials flagging the fact that we were over dependent on single sources or, when it was like the, the, the choke point was the shipping lanes and that there's a huge parallel here. We have during the, during the **Biden administration**. One of the first things during the first hundred days, the **Biden administration** did a resilience study and basically looked at where the where the choke points were. This was after **Covid**. It was looking at pharmaceuticals. It was looking. But one of the big takeaways was that we were so over dependent on China for rare earths and critical materials, critical minerals, that we had to do something ASAP. The **Trump administration** and **Trump** one also understood that we had this huge, vulnerability in critical minerals. And they had they passed it, you know, a number of executive orders and tried to sort of get the whole process started for mining, permitting, you know, reducing, permitting times, environmental, you know, restrictions and, and, and timelines. But I think it's, it's again, it's a, it's a, it's a complete parallel with what happened in the run up to, to World War two. We actually have seen this coming for a very long time. And it wasn't until China shut off the access that it that the U.S. and Europe kind of woke up to the fact that this is a big problem.

**Joe Weisenthal**: How often do you hear people in DC talk about the potential for capital misallocation when it comes to rare earths, or is the idea of, like a cylinder with magnets is like, not not as much of a looming concern given the urgency of the problem?

</details>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: 我认为对**Solyndra**风险承担的妖魔化已经困扰我们很长时间了。我们必须更愿意承担风险，并以两党合作的方式，认识到这是一个重要的时刻，我们必须实际承担更多风险。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: I think that that the, demonization of risk taken on **Solyndra** has really plagued us for a long time. We have to be much more ready to take risk and be like, hold hands on a bipartisan basis and realize that this is a big moment where we have to actually take more risk.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 我喜欢我们在这段对话中使用的所有类比。显然是**合成橡胶**。但你之前提到了**水力压裂**，很多人会承认**水力压裂**对美国现在的经济福祉至关重要。我们已经成为能源出口国。但与此同时，**水力压裂**存在负面外部性，即环境破坏。关于它实际影响有多大，有很多担忧和争议。当我们鼓励发展更多的国内稀土产业时，美国需要考虑哪些权衡？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: So I do love all the analogies we've used in this conversation. So obviously **synthetic rubber**. But you mentioned **fracking** before, and a lot of people will concede that **fracking** was incredibly crucial to America's, you know, economic well-being nowadays. And we've become an energy exporter. But at the same time, there's an externality, a negative externality associated with **fracking**, which is environmental damage. And there's a lot of concern and also controversy about how much impact that actually has. What are the trade offs that the US would have to think about as we encourage more of a domestic rare earth industry?

</details>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: 所以，再次强调，存在权衡。我认为，我将回到创新这一点，因为我认为我们能够以清洁方式做到这一点的方法之一就是通过这些新技术。你提到了**伯克利**，**力拓**（**Rio Tinto**）正在使用一种他们专有的新微生物，他们刚刚开始在亚利桑那州的一些旧矿山中使用，在那里他们以前无法经济地提取铜，但通过使用微生物，他们能够以清洁的方式，利用**生物技术**解决方案，以具有成本竞争力的方式提取他们以前无法提取的铜。他们现在正在推广这项技术。他们将在未来几个月内进行。我认为非常值得注意的是，一家大型矿业公司正在尝试**生物技术**解决方案，以解锁他们认为已经关闭的矿山的价值。所以我们可以以清洁、快速且具有成本竞争力的方式做到这一点。因此，我认为有办法做到这一点。并且通过利用创新，我认为我们需要非常注意这一点，因为采矿和精炼是肮脏的行业。这就是生活。如果我们能以更清洁的方式进行，那么这将是一种更可持续的方式，能够拥有一个真正符合国家利益的产业向前发展。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: So again, there are there are tradeoffs and I think one of the, you know, I'm going to pivot back to the innovation because I think one of the ways we can do this in a clean way is through some of these new technologies. You were talking about **Berkeley** and there, you know, so **Rio Tinto** is is using, a proprietary new microbe, that they have that they've just started, utilizing in some of their old mines in Arizona where they didn't have the ability to economically extract copper, but using microbes, they are able, in a clean way, to use a biotech solution to actually extract copper on a cost competitive basis, that they were not able to extract. And they're rolling this out right now. They'll be doing it, you know, in the coming in the, in the months ahead. And I think it's really noteworthy that, that you have a, you know, a large mining company that is taking a plunge into a biotech solution to how to unlock value, that they thought the mine was basically, you know, it was it was closed. So we can do that in a way that is clean. We can do it in a way that's fast and cost competitive and so I think that there are ways to do that. And with using innovation, I don't think I think we need to be very mindful of that because mining and refining are dirty businesses. That's just that's life. And if we can do them, if we do them in a cleaner way, then that is a much more sustainable way to actually have, you know, have an industry moving forward that actually suits the national interest.

**Tracy Alloway**: 谁做了那期**生物技术**风险投资的节目？这么多有趣的**生物技术**内容，我以前从未想过。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Who did that? Biotech, VC episode. So much interesting biotech stuff that I never really thought about.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的，我从没想过我的名字会……听起来还有更多事情要做。并且，学习这些东西。你提到了**国家实验室**，它们正受到威胁，对吧？我的意思是，你谈到它们是美国经济和工业的重要瑰宝，所有关于资金削减的故事等等。这之间有什么交集？从你的角度来看，我们是否通过这些预算选择削弱了自己的努力？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah, like I never thought my name would. Sounds of it much more to do. And, learning about some of this and, you know, one one thing you mentioned, the **national labs**, they're under threat, right? I mean, like, you talked about them as being there's, important crown jewels of the U.S. economy as industry, all these stories about funding cuts, etc.. What is the intersection there? And from your perspective anyway? Are we undercutting our own efforts through some of these, through some of these budgetary choices?

</details>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: 绝对是。我的意思是，这是我们做得非常非常好的事情。全世界都在关注**DARPA**、**ARPA-E**以及相关的**国家实验室**如何成为巨大的创新引擎。而且，这通常是企业家们进来并理解科学的应用如何商业化的问题。但现在正是我们必须加倍投入创新和研发的时候。这不仅限于**国家实验室**，也包括大学，因为这也是创新的来源。**Niron**的突破就来自**明尼苏达大学**。所以我认为，你现在要确保在这个特殊时刻，解决方案可以来自**生物技术**，而不是采矿技术。你现在不应该切断任何研发投资渠道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Heidi Crebo-Rediker**: Absolutely. I mean, this is this is something that we do really, really well. The whole world looks at the way that the **DARPA** and **Arpa-E** and the **national labs** that are associated are actually like huge innovation engines. And it's, you know, often it's it's a matter of of, you know, people coming in, entrepreneurs coming in and understanding what the applications of the science can be to commercialize it. But this is exactly the time where we have to double down on the innovation and the investment in R&D. That is not only in the **national labs**, but also universities, because that's where this is coming from as well. **Niron**'s, you know, breakthrough came from the **University of Minnesota**. So I think, you know, you want to you want to make sure that right now, in this particular moment where the where the the solutions can come from biotech as opposed to mining tech. You don't want to be cutting off any channels of investment in R&D right now.

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: **Tracy** I really want to learn more about, you know, industrial biotech.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的，我的意思是，我们在对话中提到了它，但我感觉关于这种自然科学与采矿等领域的交叉，可能会有很多有趣的节目。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah, I mean, we mentioned it during the conversation, but I feel like there could be tons of interesting episodes on the crossover of that sort of natural science and mining and stuff like that.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 好的，我正在看**力拓**网站上的一个页面，标题是“生命寻找出路：微生物”。然后它说，当恐龙消失时，它们的小伙伴微生物适应并繁衍，证明了它们随着时间的推移具有韧性。现在它们可以作为我们采矿领域一些最具突破性进展的工具。这很酷。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Well, I'm looking at a page on **Rio Tinto**'s website right now, and the title is Life Finds a Way microbes. And then it says while dinosaurs vanished, their tiny companions microbes adapted and thrived, proving their resilience over time. And now they can be used as some of our most groundbreaking advancements, in mining. So that's pretty cool.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的。那很令人兴奋。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah. That's exciting.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 让我们请一位科学家来谈谈微生物。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Let's do let's get a scientist or something on to talk about microbes.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 科学。我有点想看看这一切是如何运作的，但当然你实际上看不到微生物，所以我只能想象。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Science. I kind of want to see how all of this works, but of course you can't actually see the microbes, so I'll just have to think about it.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 想象一下，肯定有**YouTube**视频。至少我们可以去某个矿山看看，对吧？我肯定，就像有大量的水流过。你想知道一些事情，就像有人……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Just imagine there's gotta be a **YouTube**. At least we could go on the road to some mine, right? I'm sure. And like there's just a heavy water passing. You want to know that something just look like someone?

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 不，但我认为那真的很有趣。我想，你知道，在我看来，当我以前思考稀土挑战时，我有点假设，好吧，美国可能可以克服我们的工业依赖，代价是大量的金钱，基本上是大量的亏损投资，因为，国防的性质就是这样。国家安全就是，好吧，你有时就是得花钱。所以有趣的是，我们的技术不仅可能解决战略元素问题，而且实际上可能具有成本竞争力，也许可以创造出口机会，也许还可以盈利。这非常有趣。在今天的报告之前，我并没有真正认识到这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: No, but I thought that was really interesting. I guess I thought, you know, in my mind, when I think about some of the when I thought about the Rare Earth challenge before, I sort of assumed, I suppose, that, okay, the US probably could, overcome our industrial reliance at the cost of a lot of money, basically a lot of loss making investment, because, again, that's that's the nature of, defense. National security is okay. You just have to sometimes spend money, etc.. So it's interesting, the prospect that our technologies that not only could solve perhaps the sort of strategic element, but that actually could be cost competitive, perhaps could create export opportunities, could perhaps also be, for profit. That's very interesting. And I hadn't really appreciated that prior to a day's report.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 是的，我认为这份报告的总体主旨是，你不可能在中国的地盘上击败它，或者你肯定不能以中国发展这个行业的方式击败它，即基本上忽视很多环境问题。所以你必须转向美国自己的竞争优势，那就是研发。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Alloway**: Yeah, I think the overall thrust of the report, this idea of like, okay, you're not going to beat China necessarily on its own territory or you're certainly not going to beat them in the same way that China has developed this industry by, you know, basically ignoring a lot of environmental, concerns and things like that. So you have to turn to the US's own competitive advantage, which is research and development.

</details>

**Joe Weisenthal**: 是的。还有大量的政府资本，我们有时在部署上遇到问题，有时没有。**Heidi**将中国最近切断稀土供应描述为人们真正意识到这是一个问题的时刻，这非常有趣。因此，有可能真正激发一些行动。我毫不怀疑美国拥有做这件事的能力、技术、科学、自然资源、资金等。我唯一质疑的是，我们是否拥有那种组织能力。当然，现在**国家研究实验室**是这种担忧的主要例子，因为许多创新都来自那里。人们普遍承认这是一个非常严重的问题。但显然，他们的预算同时受到损害。每个人都能达成共识吗？我们能优先考虑它们吗？我们能说，不，我们想协同行动吗？还是你只是遇到各种政治斗争和各种不协调、不同步、相互掣肘的派系？这仍然是我最主要的担忧来源。但这是一个合理的担忧，我想说，也许正如你所说，可能已经有一些激励作用，也许这里有一些出路。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe Weisenthal**: Yeah. And also like huge amounts of government capital, which, you know, sometimes we have an issue deploying, sometimes we don't. It was super interesting that **Heidi** described, you know, the recent cutting off of China's rare earths as like the moment where people have really realized this is an issue. And so there is the potential to actually galvanize some action. I have no doubt in my mind that the US has the sort of capacity the know how, the science, the natural resources, the money, etc. to do it. I only question, of course, whether we have the sort of organizational capacity. And of course, you know, the now the **national research labs** are sort of the prime example of the concern here is the site with which a lot of these innovations come from. There is this widespread acknowledgment that this is a very serious thing. And apparently, you know, they're seeing their budgets impaired at the same time. Can everyone get on the same page? Can we prioritize them? Can we say like, no, we want to like, move in concert? Or do you just hit these like various like political fight in these various factions, etc., that are not coordinated? They're not on the same page that are working at cross-purposes. I am that remains that remains my my main source of concern. But for a legitimate concern, I would say perhaps to your point, maybe there has been some galvanization and maybe there are some paths here.

</details>

**Tracy Alloway**: 好的，我还在看**力拓**的这个页面。是的。你说它很棒。他们一直在引用《**侏罗纪公园**》（**Jurassic Park**），这不是我从**力拓**那里期望听到的。但无论如何，我们到此为止吧？
