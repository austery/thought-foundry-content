title: 从阿拉斯加透视美国经济：旧金山联储主席戴利深度解析通胀、关税与AI浪潮
---

### 为什么是阿拉斯加？
Tracy：大家好，欢迎收听新一期的 Odd Lots 播客。我是 Tracy Alloway。

Joe：我是 Joe Weisenthal。Tracy，不知道你怎么样，但当我想起阿拉斯加时，我想到的是雪、冰川、黄金、石油、管道、北方风情、小型飞机，以及美国联邦储备银行系统的第十二区。

Tracy：这正是我脑海里浮现的清单，简直不可思议。

Joe：难以置信。

Tracy：好吧，我们确实身处阿拉斯加，具体来说是在安克雷奇。现在到这个极北之州进行实地考察，是一个非常有趣的时机，因为阿拉斯加实际上与我们当前所处的时期有很多关联。

Joe：你知道，我们过去常说亚利桑那州是一个非常“Odd Lots”的州。

Tracy：哦是的，我仍然这么认为。但这（阿拉斯加）也是一个非常“Odd Lots”的州，因为我们在这里听到了太多具体的事情，无论是人口结构变化、石油，还是显然至关重要的物流——你在这里能感受到各种火车、飞机和轮船枢纽的存在。还有住房问题，这里的住房环境也非常困难。所以，这对我们来说是一个内容非常丰富的报道领域。

Joe：当然。我们确实请到了最合适的嘉宾来深入探讨这一切。我们将与玛丽·戴利（Mary Daly）交谈。她当然是旧金山联邦储备银行的行长，因此也是第十二区的行长，而阿拉斯加就在这个区内。她此行来到这里，并将与我们进行深入的交流。那么，玛丽，欢迎来到我们的节目。

Mary：非常感谢。我很高兴来到这里，也很高兴我们能在阿拉斯加相聚。

<p class="english-text">Tracy: Hello and welcome to another episode of the Odd Lots podcast. I'm Tracy Alloway.</p>
<p class="english-text">Joe: and I'm Joe Weisenthal. Joe, I don't know about you, but when I think about Alaska, I think about snow, glaciers, gold, oil, pipelines, northern exposure, small plains, and the 12th district of the Federal Reserve system of banks.</p>
<p class="english-text">Tracy: That's literally the exact list that I think includes.</p>
<p class="english-text">Joe: Incredible.</p>
<p class="english-text">Tracy: I can't believe it. All right. Well, we are in fact here in Alaska in Anchorage to be specific and it's a really interesting time to be taking a field trip to the very very northern state because Alaska actually has a lot of relevance to our current period.</p>
<p class="english-text">Joe: See, you know, we used to talk about how like Arizona was a very odd loy state.</p>
<p class="english-text">Tracy: Oh yeah. And I still think but this is a very odd outlaw state because there are so many specific things that we hear about here whether it's a demographic shift oil obviously logistics is huge it's you just feel the presence of the various train and plane hubs and ship hubs here in Alaska so it is and housing which has a very difficult housing environment here too. So it is a very meaty area for us to do uh coverage.</p>
<p class="english-text">Joe: Absolutely. And we do in fact have the perfect guests to talk all about it. We are going to be speaking with Mary Daly. She is of course the San Francisco Fed president and therefore the president of the 12th district and Alaska is in that district and she's here on a trip and she's going to talk to us for quite a while. So Mary, welcome to the show.</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: Thank you so much. I'm delighted to be here and I'm so delighted that we're in Alaska together.</p>

### 阿拉斯加：美国经济的缩影与领先指标
Tracy：我想问一下，你实际上多久来一次这里？

Mary：我定期来，但不仅仅是我。我的团队成员、经济学家、我们的公共事务官员都会来。最终，我们试图从我们辖区内所有的州获取信息。所以，我们会去我们区内的所有九个州。我们会向他们所有人提问，了解他们在经济中的生活状况，他们关心什么，有哪些机遇，又有哪些挑战。

Joe：那么，从宏观角度看，阿拉斯加目前的经济状况如何？或者说，阿拉斯加经济实际上由什么构成？

Mary：让我告诉你一些我第一次来阿拉斯加时学到的东西。它不是一个单一的经济体，而是一系列经济体的集合。对吧？如果你去那些只能通过飞机到达的偏远地区，那里没有道路，他们生活在一种无现金的经济中。那种自给自足的经济模式看起来与安克雷奇截然不同，在安克雷奇，你可以用数字钱包在本地支付，这与美国本土48州更为相似。所以，当你思考阿拉斯加时，你必须想到多个经济体、多个社区。你必须想象，这里的领导者和民众必须共同努力，确保他们做出的所有决策都能服务于他们多样化的需求。我认为这正是它如此丰富的原因。它确实处于许多可能影响国家经济的事务的前沿，是一个非常好的学习之地。

Tracy：在当前这个“不确定性”成为日常用语的时刻，阿拉斯加是否具有特殊的现实意义？我们正面临关税问题，通胀仍然是一个挥之不去的担忧，而且阿拉斯加的生活成本本来就很高。

Mary：你可以把当下的阿拉斯加看作一个领先指标。他们正处在，如果你愿意这么说的话，我们经济中所有正在发生的事情的“完美风暴”中心。他们的物价水平更高，因此在通胀上升时遭受了更严重的冲击。他们在认真思考如何应对关税问题并进行进口。他们是大量联邦支出的接受者，这些支出与战略防御、军事能力甚至卫星等项目有关。所以他们正处在风口浪尖。因此，来到这里，看看他们是如何应对的，首先，这告诉我我们的经济在更广泛的层面上对这些不同变化的适应能力有多强。其次，它为我提供了一个领先的指示，让我了解那些处于最前沿的企业和社区将如何应对。我可以利用这些信息来观察美国本土48州，尤其是我辖区内的州，并提出问题：“我们在那里看到了什么？”所以，这让我能及早洞察到这些变化以及它们可能如何影响经济。

<p class="english-text">Tracy: I was going to ask, how often do you actually come here?</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: I come regularly, but it's not just me. members of my team, economist, our engagement officer. It's our public engagement officers. They come too. Ultimately, we're trying to source information from all of our states. So, we go to all the states in our district. There's nine of them. And we ask questions of all of them about how they're living in the economy, what are the things that concern them, what are the opportunities, what are the challenges.</p>
<p class="english-text">Joe: So, big picture, how's the Alaska economy right now? Or what do what constitutes the Alaska economy actually?</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: Well, let me tell you something. I learned the first time I came to Alaska. It isn't an economy. It's a series of economies. Right? If you go to the more remote areas that you can only say access by airplane, you can't there are no roads. They live on a in a cashless economy. The subsistence that looks very different than Anchorage where you're using your digital wallet to pay for things locally that more familiar to the lower 48. And so really when you think of Alaska, you have to think of economies, communities, and you have to imagine that the leaders here and the population here has to come together to ensure that all the decisions they make serve the variety of needs they have. I think that's what makes it so rich. It really is at the forefront of so many things that can affect the national economy that it's a really great place to learn.</p>
<p class="english-text">Tracy: Is Alaska of particular relevance at this particular moment in time when you know uncertainty is the word of the day? We do have tariffs going on. Uh inflation is still a lingering concern and Alaska of course does already have a high cost of living.</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: So you know think about Alaska as right now a leading indicator. They're sitting in the perfect storm if you will of all the things going on in our economy. They have a higher price level and we they've suffered even more from rising inflation. They are thinking hard about how do they import and how do they do this given the tariffs. They are a recipient of a tremendous amount of federal spending related to strategic defense and the military capacity and even things like satellites. So they are right there. And so coming here and seeing how they're dealing with it, one, it tells me how resilient our economy is more generally to these different changes. And two, it provides me a leading indication of how businesses in communities that are right there on the forefront are going to respond to this. And I can use that information to look on the lower 48, especially my states, and ask, "What are we seeing there?" So, it gives me early insight into the changes and how they're likely to affect the economy.</p>

### 人口外流与高生活成本的双重挑战
Joe：玛丽刚才的介绍比我做得还好。

Tracy：坚韧和顽强，这感觉像是世界上每个城镇或城市都喜欢用来形容自己居民的词，但这里是我去过的第一个让我百分之百相信的地方。当你听到那些在这里生活了好几代人的人的故事时，你会觉得，好吧，我真的完全相信了。

Joe：但这很有趣。有很多话题可以深入，但我们听说安克雷奇的人口水平在下降。这对我来说很有趣，因为你是旧金山联储的行长。所以你的辖区有一部分正在与人口减少作斗争，而旧金山本身则是一个住房极度紧张的劳动力目的地，对吧？人们想去那里，在另一种“淘金热”中发家致富。但请跟我们谈谈，你对一个人口大量外流、难以留住年轻人的地方所面临的经济挑战有何看法。

Mary：这非常困难。阿拉斯加在这方面并非个例。你可以看看我辖区外的北达科他州和其他地方，去那些农村社区，他们会说：“我们想留住我们的人，但这很难做到。”但在阿拉斯加尤其如此的是，有几件事情同时在发生。最终，当人们决定留在一个地方或来到一个地方时，他们想要一个对他们能否茁壮成长至关重要的生态系统。他们想要工作，不仅仅是22岁时开始的工作，而是可以随着年龄增长而发展，甚至可能转变的职业。他们想要住房机会，这样如果他们想组建家庭，或者只是想拥有一套房子，他们都能实现。目前，即使只是租赁房产也很难找到。所以存在这些压力。这带来了风险。然后，如果你想组建家庭，还有教育问题，人口外流意味着可用的学校更少。于是，这个平衡就开始被打破了。

Mary：你知道，真正需要发生的是，他们必须相信他们可以留下来，因为会有更繁荣的事情发生，或者他们真的很喜欢户外活动和这片美景。我认为这个平衡现在不像以前那样划算了，因为最终如果人们没有工作、没有住处，或者看不到自己事业和家庭的光明未来，他们就会感到被迫去别处。我认为这正是州领导、安克雷奇领导以及我见过的所有商界领袖最根本的担忧。有个人是这么说的：我们如何吸引人？这很重要。但我们如何留住他们？当我们的经济表现不如美国本土48州的一些竞争经济体时，我们如何保持他们对我们的兴趣？

Tracy：说到这里，你能否谈谈阿拉斯加的生活成本？这是另一个有些独特的地方。像食品杂货这样简单的东西价格更高，住房可能以一种你对阿拉斯加这么大的地方不会想到的方式受到限制。但这个问题经常被提及，我很好奇你如何看待阿拉斯加具体的通胀压力，特别是考虑到过去几年的情况。通胀是所有州都关心的问题，但我猜想在这个特定的州，这个问题尤其突出。

Mary：当然。你首先要认识到，在阿拉斯加几乎所有东西都更贵。为什么？嗯，你必须进口很多我们习以为常的东西，无论是医疗保健产品、建筑用品，还是简单的食品、鞋子和其他物品。现在，我们向更广泛的美国地区也进口很多这类东西，但运到阿拉斯加的运输成本，以及在整个阿拉斯加地区的分销都非常具有挑战性。单是运输成本一项，就极大地推高了价格。这已经是一个较高的物价水平了。然后你再加上更高的通货膨胀率。那么，美国本土48州的任何人可能感受到的痛苦，在阿拉斯加都会被放大。

Mary：再加上一个事实，20年前，阿拉斯加的工资曾经高于美国本土48州，但这个差距在过去20年里缩小了。所以现在工资水平大致相同，但物价却高得多，而通胀正进一步推高物价。而且，进口到阿拉斯加的东西并没有变得更便宜。我想这就是为什么人们会说，你知道，当我尝试建造一个房产时，我是一个建筑商，现在我必须支付更高的运输成本。如果在此基础上，基本投入品还要被征收关税，那就算不过账了。这就是他们正在处理的等式。就是更贵，更难。这里很冷，很多地方很偏远。所有这些都带来了挑战，最终导致成本上升。

<p class="english-text">Joe: Mary just did the intro better than I did. I think.</p>
<p class="english-text">Tracy: resilient and scrappy feels like one of those things where like every town in the world or every city likes to describe their residents as such, but this is like the first place I've been where like 100% believe it. And when hearing the stories of people who have been here multiple generations, it's like, okay, you actually I actually fully buy that.</p>
<p class="english-text">Joe: But it's interesting. So, one of the there's a lot to go down, but we've heard about declining population levels, particularly in Anchorage. And it's interesting to me because you're a San Francisco Fed president. So you have part of your district is wrestling with population decline and then also San Francisco itself this massively housing constrained destination for labor, right? People want to go to make their fortunes in a different kind of gold rush. But talk to us about like you know your perception of the economic challenges in a place where there's a lot of out migration where it's difficult to say keep young people around.</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: It's very difficult. Alaska is not unique there. You can look outside of my district at North Dakota and other places and go to these rural communities and they'll say, "We want to keep our people and it's hard to do it, right? But what is particularly true in Alaska is there's several things going on all at once. And ultimately when people decide to stay at a place or come to a place, they want an ecosystem of things that are important to their ability to thrive. They want to have work and not just work they start when they're 22, but work that they can grow into and maybe change into as they age. They want to have housing opportunities so that if they want to raise a family or if they just want to own a home, they have that. At this point, there's even trouble getting property even if you're just leasing it. So, there's those types of pressure. So, that's taking that risk. And then if you're trying to build a family, there's the schooling issues of population outflows mean that fewer schools are available. So then the equation starts to break down.</p>
<p class="english-text">And what you know really has to happen is they have to believe that they can stay because something more prosperous will occur or that they really like the outdoors and being part of this beauty. And I think that that equation is not penciling it out like it was because ultimately if people don't have jobs or place to live or see a bright future for their career and their family then they will feel forced to go elsewhere. And I think that's where the state leadership and this the anchorage leadership and all the business leaders I meet with that's their fundamental concern. One person put it this way. How do we attract people? That's important. But how do we maintain them? How do we retain the interest in us when our economy is not doing as well as some competing economies in the lower 48?</p>
<p class="english-text">Tracy: Well, on that note, can you talk a little bit maybe about the cost of living in Alaska? Because this is another thing that is, you know, somewhat unique. There are higher prices for just simple things like groceries, housing might be constrained in a way that you wouldn't like necessarily think about for a place as big as Alaska. But this comes up quite a lot and I'm very curious how you're thinking about inflationary pressures on Alaska specifically given that over the past few years. Inflation was a concern for all of the states, but I imagine it was an extra concern here in this particular one.</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: Absolutely. You start with this just the recognition that almost everything costs more in Alaska. Why? Well, you have to import a lot of the things that we take for granted, you know, whether it's health care products or things that you can use for your buildings or simple groceries and shoes and other things. Now, we import a lot of that stuff to the broader US, but the shipping cost to come all the way up to Alaska and then the distribution across the greater Alaskan region is very challenging. There's transportation costs that if you only take that alone really drive up the prices. That's already a higher price level. and then you add to it a higher inflation rate. Well, then the pain that anyone might feel in the lower 48, that's just magnified in Alaska.</p>
<p class="english-text">You put with that the fact that in the, you know, 20 years ago, wages in Alaska used to be higher than wages in the lower 48, but that gap has shrunk over the last 20 years. And so now the wage levels are roughly the same and the prices are a lot higher and inflation is driving those up more. and things aren't getting cheaper to import into Alaska. And I think that's why people say, you know, it's just when I try to build a a property, I'm a builder and now I have to pay higher costs to ship things in. And if I get tariffs on top of that on the basic inputs, that just doesn't pencil out anymore. And that's the equation they're dealing with. It's just more expensive. It's harder. It's cold here. It's remote in many places. And all of those put challenges that ultimately raise costs.</p>

### 关税冲击：企业如何应对通胀压力
Joe：现在整个美国最大的问题可能就是关税在多大程度上会引发通胀，在多大程度上会转嫁给消费者，或者被其他方吸收。你从企业那里具体听到了什么，关于他们能做什么以及关税对他们运营的实际影响？

Mary：当然。我先从阿拉斯加说起，因为我们在这里，而且我来之后一直在和企业会面，但如果你不介意的话，我会把范围扩大。在阿拉斯加，我们听到的情况与在美国本土48州听到的非常相似。我们听说他们想把成本转嫁给消费者，因为这很难处理，但消费者已经筋疲力尽了。这是我经常听到的一个说法。消费者已经筋疲力尽了。我不知道他们还能承受多少。他们已经在消费降级。如果他们过去去某家零售商，现在他们会转向下一级的商店，出现在一元店里，试图找到收支平衡的方法。或者他们干脆放弃了过去可能会做的一些事情。

Mary：这些事情给公司带来了压力，让他们觉得：“如果我提高价格，我就会失去销量，我必须把这个账算清楚。”所以我看到更多的是他们选择压缩利润，然后寄希望于他们可以集体去华盛顿，为他们试图进口或使用的任何东西争取豁免，或者他们可以挺过一次性的关税上调，然后恢复到更正常的状态。在建筑业，你会听到这样的话：“我们从钢结构转向了木结构，因为钢材被征收了关税，现在我们正在寻找可以在本地制造或进口成本更低的替代品。”

Joe：从钢结构转向木结构，这似乎是一个重大的权衡。

Mary：你知道，令人瞩目的是，而且我认为阿拉斯加在这方面的创新方式甚至超过了我见过的其他地方，那就是建筑业和工程师们。他们知道如何建造东西，也知道如何让它们耐用。所以，你给他们一套材料，这几乎就像你参加那些烹饪节目，他们给你一盒东西，然后对参赛者说：“做出美味的东西来。”建筑师和工程师们擅长的就是这个。他们会说：“这是我的一盒材料。我要造一座耐用的房子，能抵御寒冷气候，能建在永久冻土上。我会想办法解决的。”我不会小看他们，因为他们非常擅长这个。这最终带来了应对更高成本所需的创新。问题是，这一切都同时发生，使得创新速度很难快到足以抵消成本。

Mary：所以我听到了成本转嫁的说法，但我并没有看到很多实际的转嫁。你可以从已公布的数据中看到这一点，将范围扩大到阿拉斯加以外。公布的数据显示，商品价格通胀正在上升。它没有蔓延到服务业通胀，无论是住房还是我所认为的剔除住房后的**超级核心服务**（Super Core Services: 指剔除住房后的核心服务通胀，被认为是衡量潜在通胀压力的关键指标）。这是个好消息。从历史和现状来看，最好的判断是，目前还没有太大的动力会使其蔓延。那将会演变成一个持续的通胀问题。当然，你不能排除这种可能性，但我认为没有太多证据表明它正在发生。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Joe: probably like the biggest question right now in the sort of for the whole US is the degree to which tariffs will be inflationary, the degree to which they'll be passed on to consumers or absorbed by whoever. What specifically are you hearing from businesses about what they can do and the actual impact of tariffs on their operations?</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: Sure. I'll start with Alaska since we're here and I've been meeting with businesses since I came, but I'll go broaden it if you don't mind. So on the Alaska, we're hearing very similar things to what we hear in the lower 48. We're hearing that they want to pass it along to consumers because it's challenging to deal with, but that consumers are exhausted. You know, that's a phrase I hear a lot. Consumers are exhausted. I just don't know how much they can do. They're already trading down. If they used to go to one retailer, they're moving to the next level down, showing up in the dollar stores to try to find ways to make ends meet. Or they're just foregoing things that they might do in the past.</p>
<p class="english-text">Those things put pressure on firms to say, "Well, if I raise my prices, I'm going to lose my sales and I have to pencil that equation out." So, I see more of them eating it in into their profits and then just hoping that they can either collectively go to Washington and get an exception for whatever they're trying to import or or use, or they can weather a one-off tariff increase and then move to a more normal set of things. You know, in construction, you're hearing things like, "Well, we we moved from steel framing to lumber framing, wood framing, because steel was tariffed, and now we're looking for alternatives that we can make here or have lower import costs."</p>
<p class="english-text">Joe: It seems like a serious trade-off, going from steel to lumber framing.</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: Well, you know, what's remarkable, and this is remarkable, and I think Alaska does this in ways that are even more innovative than other places I've seen, is construction and engineers. They know how to build things and they know how to make them durable. So, you give them a set of materials. It's almost like when you do those cooking shows and they give you a box of things and they say to the people, "Make something delicious." That's what construction people and engineers are good for about. They say, "Here's my box of things. I'm going to make a house that's durable, can last the cold climate, can be built on the perafrost. I'm going to figure it out." And I don't count them out because they're very good at this. And it ultimately leads to the innovation that's needed to deal with the higher cost. The problem is it's happening all at once and it makes it really hard to innovate fast enough to offset the cost.</p>
<p class="english-text">So I'm hearing pass through but I'm not hear seeing a lot of it. You saw this in the published data spreading it out past Alaska. Published data is coming out. Goods price inflation is going up. It's not spilling over into services inflation either in housing or in services. You know what I think of as super core services exhousing. That's good news. And the best sense from history and from what's happening right now is that there won't be much of an impetus. so far to spill over. That would get into a persistent inflation problem. You can't count it out, of course, but I don't think there's a lot of evidence that it's occurring.</p>

### 通胀预期：阿拉斯加的独特视角
Tracy：我还有一堆关于关税的问题，但既然你刚才提到了历史，我很好奇一件事：我们能从阿拉斯加的经验中学到关于通胀预期如何运作的什么吗？在这个州，高昂的生活成本一直是最受关注的问题。当你开始看到价格方面出现那些特殊的发展，当人们谈论像关税这样的事情时，你是否看到这里的未来通胀率预期比美国其他地方上升得更快？

Mary：关于州一级的通胀预期，并没有太多好的数据。所以我们必须依赖与人们的交谈。当我和人们交谈时，他们更担心，但这其中有区别。衡量通胀预期的方式是，我是否要求更高的工资？我是否会去找老板说：“我跟不上了，我需要更高的工资。”我们并没有看到阿拉斯加和美国本土48州在这方面有真正的区别。我们只是看到，当通胀快速上升且劳动力市场紧张时，个人会说：“我要去找我的公司谈谈。”而公司也更愿意给予加薪。但现在劳动力市场已经有所缓和，人们不太有兴趣去要求更多的钱。这也与他们认为关税是一次性事件的想法相符。

Mary：我所知道的思考通胀预期的最佳方式，以及收集这类信息的方法，是观察短期通胀预期与中长期通胀预期的对比。所以我能做的就是向阿拉斯加人提出这个问题，我没有看到任何与全国公布数据不同的情况，即短期预期在上升，但中长期来看，他们仍然相信我们能将通胀降至2%。这向我表明，他们认为这是一次性的。关税上涨，你为之买单。这完全是关于管理增加的成本，而不是认为这只是另一轮通货膨胀的开始。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tracy: I have a bunch more tariff questions, but since you mentioned history just then, one thing I'm really curious about, is there anything we can learn about how inflation expectations work from the Alaskan experience? So, this is a state where the higher cost of living has been top of mind. When you start to see those idiosyncratic developments in terms of prices when people are talking about something like tariffs, do you see expectations for future rates of inflation ramp up faster here than perhaps elsewhere in the US?</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: So there's not a lot of good data on statewide inflation expectations. So we have to rely on talking with people. And when I talk with people, they worry more, but they don't there's a difference. Inflation expectations, the way you can measure it is, am I asking for a higher wage? Am I going in and saying, "I can't keep up. I need a higher wage." And we don't really see a difference here in Alaska than we do in the lower 48. We just see that when inflation gets to rising fast and the labor market's tight, then individuals say, "I'm going to go ask my firm." And the firms are more willing to give it. But now that the labor market has softened, people aren't that interested in going in and saying, "I want more money." It also is consistent with them thinking that the tariffs are a one-off.</p>
<p class="english-text">The best way I know to think about inflation expectations and kind of gather that type of information is look at short-term inflation expectations versus medium and longer run inflation expectations. So all I can do is ask Alaskans that question and I haven't seen anything different than the published data for the nation which is short-term or rising, medium and longer run. They still believe that we can get inflation down to 2%. That suggests to me they think it's a one-off. tariffs go up, you pay for them. And it's all about managing the increased costs rather than thinking this is just another run of of inflation.</p>

### 实地调研的价值：数据之外的洞察
Joe：这可能是一个关于流程的问题，但很明显，当涉及到**双重使命**（Dual Mandate: 美联储法案赋予其促进最大就业和稳定物价的双重目标）时，有很多好的政府数据。实际上，我们也应该谈谈数据质量。但我很好奇，除了能获得一些轶事、能作为地区联储主席与人面对面交流之外，你从这些考察中还能得到什么额外的东西？当你考虑将这些信息融入你的决策过程，或者它甚至可能如何影响未来关于利率决策的投票时，这些考察为官方数据来源增添了什么？

Mary：当然。最重要的一点是，我能了解到经济实际上是如何运作的。如果你不知道经济如何运作，就很难知道关税将如何影响经济。很难知道通货膨胀将如何影响经济，或者他们谈论的住房危机是否真的比你在其他地方看到的住房挑战更大，或者是一样的。重要的是，不仅仅是去阿拉斯加的一次考察能提供这些信息，而是去我们服务的各种地方考察。这就是为什么地区联储主席们经常外出，因为我们正在努力收集信息。这是一个重要的原因，为了解情况。

Mary：你知道，当我参观一个港口、一个制造厂或一个钻井设施时，我正在学习这些东西是如何协同工作的，这样我才能更好地理解经济在面临冲击时会如何表现。这不仅仅是关于石油价格，而是关于他们有多少工人？钻井情况如何？钻头在哪里？你在做什么？你从哪里获得你的物资？这是第一点。第二点是，数据几乎完全是回顾性的。它们告诉你上周、上个月、去年发生了什么，但你不能基于回顾性的数据来制定政策。所以，它告诉你我们目前处于什么水平，但它不告诉你我们将走向何方。因此，与人们交谈并实际向他们提出这样的问题。我现在一直问这个问题。所以，你感到非常不确定。我确信这很令人担忧。你是否因此改变了你的行为？第一个问题的答案总是肯定的，我们非常不确定。而第二个问题的答案一直是，我们并没有完全改变我们的行为。所以我继续投资，但我不一定会承担风险更高的项目。如果我要继续下去，我想要一个好的投资回报率。所以我认为这是来这里的另一个原因。

Mary：然后，来这里的第三个原因，这一点非常重要，而且我认为被低估了，那就是《联邦储备法》设立了12家储备银行和一个理事会。如果你回顾原始文件，你会发现这样做是为了认识到，如果你只待在华盛顿，你无法制定服务于整个国家的政策。但这给了我们作为储备银行行长的责任，去代表我们所服务的人民，通过了解他们并将他们收集到的信息带回来，帮助我们制定国家政策。所以这就是我们所做的。当我们来的时候，人们觉得我们是在为他们工作，信任度就会上升。而当信任度上升时，正如我和我的许多同事多次说过的，信任是我们最重要的工具之一。因为如果人们相信我们能够实现价格稳定和充分就业，那么他们的行为就会像我们能够实现价格稳定和充分就业一样，这是一个良性循环，实际上能更快地实现目标。

Tracy：这正是我下一个想问的问题，同样有点像流程问题。如果你的工作是代表第十二区，而第十二区内有各种各样的州，阿拉斯加在很多方面可能是一个特例，你究竟如何判断，或者说你如何确保你代表了不同的利益？不同的州可能处于经济周期的不同阶段，而你处理的基本上是一个一刀切的利率，在很多方面是一个相当生硬的工具。你如何平衡这一点？

Mary：这是一个很好的问题，我会这样说。代表各个经济体和人民的声音，并不意味着我们在交易性地平衡利率对你有利或有害。因为我们不能为任何特定地区制定国家政策，无论是第十二区、第一区，还是某个州。这只是我们工作限制的一部分，对吧？我们对国家负有双重使命。所以你要汇总数据。但是，如果你认为有了汇总的统计数据，你就知道经济的运行情况，那就错了。

Mary：有很多地方，比如关税、联邦开支削减以及石油和天然气钻探的放松管制，这些都发生在阿拉斯加。所以阿拉斯加在很多方面成为了这些因素如何影响经济的领先指标。因此，如果我在这里看到了，我就可以预期在其他地方也会看到。在某些时期，情况可能并非如此。阿拉斯加可能不会是领先指标，它会滞后于国家的经济表现或任何经济变化。所以你足够了解你的州和你的经济体，我所有的同事也足够了解他们的州和经济体，他们知道我们在商业周期或事件序列中的位置，从而知道哪些州是领先的，哪些州是跟随的，以及哪些州受影响最大或最小，这样我们才能制定更好的政策。

Mary：我将它整合起来的另一种方式是，拥有一个非常多样化的地区有一个有趣之处，那就是你开始了解到人们是多么相似。你知道，每个人都想要同样的东西。他们希望通胀达到目标水平。他们希望有一个可持续繁荣、可持续发展的经济。他们希望能够对通胀和经济是否会陷入衰退保持理性的不关注。他们只是不想去想这些。这是一个普遍的真理。无论我是在阿拉斯加、夏威夷还是内华达，都无关紧要。爱达荷州和加利福尼亚州在这方面的目标和感受是相同的。所以我可以去看看，人们是紧张、乐观还是谨慎乐观？今天我看到了一些担忧，但当你真正追问他们时，这在整个第十二区都是如此，人们是谨慎乐观的。有些城市的起重机比其他城市多，但每个地方都有起重机。

<p class="english-text">Joe: Maybe it's a process question, but you know, obviously when it comes to the dual mandate, there's a lot of good government data. Actually, we should talk about data quality, too. And um but I'm curious like what is the additional thing that you get out of these trips other I mean, it's good to have anecdotes. It's good to make face to face as their regional Fed president, but when you think about incorporating your process or how it may even affect future votes on interest rate decisions, what do these trips add to official sources of data? Yeah, sure. Absolutely.</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: So, the most important thing is that I learn about how the economy actually works. It's very difficult to know how tariffs will affect an economy if you don't know how it works. It's very difficult to know how inflation will affect the economy or if the housing crisis that they talk about is really larger than the housing challenges you see in other places or it's the same. And importantly, it's not just a trip to Alaska that informs that. It's a trip to variety of places that we serve and that's why regional Fed presidents are out a lot because we're trying to collect the information. That's one big reason to learn about it.</p>
<p class="english-text">You know, when I take a tour of, you know, a port or a manufacturing plant or a drilling facility, I'm learning how those things work together so that I can better understand how the economy will perform in when they face a shock. It's not all about the price of oil. It's about how many workers do they have? What's the drilling? Where are the bits? What are you working on? Where do you get your things? So, that's piece one. Piece two is data are almost entirely backward-looking. They tell you about what happened last week, last month, last year, but you can't make policy on backward-looking data. So, it tells you where we are in level terms, but it doesn't tell you where you're going. And so, getting to talk with people and actually ask them questions like this. I ask this question all the time now. So, you feel really uncertain. I'm sure that's worrisome. Are you changing your behavior because of it? And the first question is always yes, we're very uncertain. And the second one has been we're not changing our behavior entirely. So, I'm continuing to invest, but I'm not necessarily taking on riskier projects. I want a good ROI if I'm going to keep going. So, I think that's another reason to come.</p>
<p class="english-text">And then the third reason to come and this is really important and and I think underappreciated is the Federal Reserve Act created 12 reserve banks and a board of governors and did so if you go back and look at the original documents to recognize that you can't make policy that serves a nation if you only are in DC. But that gives us a responsibility as reserve bank presidents to represent the people who we're serving in terms of learning about them and bringing their collected information to help us make national policy. So that's what we do and when we come people feel like we are doing the work on their behalf and trust goes up and when trust goes up as I've said many times and many of my colleagues have trust is one of our most important tools because if people believe we can achieve price stability and full employment then they behave as if we can achieve price stability and full employment and that's a virtuous cycle that actually delivers it faster.</p>
<p class="english-text">Tracy: This was going to be my next question actually and again it's kind of a process question but if your job is to represent the 12th district and the 12th district has diverse states in it and Alaska perhaps in many ways is an outlier how do you actually judge I I guess or how do you make sure that you're representing different interests perhaps different states might be at different places in the economic cycle and you're dealing with basically an interest rate that tends to be a single oneizefits-all interest rate, a pretty blunt tool in many ways. How do you balance that?</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: That's a great question and I'll say it this way. Representing the economies and the voices of the people doesn't mean we're transactionally balancing the interest rates hurts you, it helps you. Because we can't make national policy for any particular region, not the 12th district, not the first district, not a state. And that's just part of the constraints of our job, right? We have a dual mandate for the nation. So you're aggregating up the data. But then it's a mistake to think that if you have the aggregate statistics, you know how the economy is fairing.</p>
<p class="english-text">There are many places where let's take tariffs and federal spending cuts and oil and gas drilling deregulation that's happening all in Alaska. So Alaska becomes the leading indicator in many ways for how this is affecting the economy. And so if I see it here, I can then expect to see it other places. in some time periods that would not be true. Alaska would not be a leading indicator. It would lag the economic performance of the country and or any economic changes. So you know your states and your economies well enough and all my colleagues know their states and economies well enough that they know where we are in the business cycle or the sequencing of things to know which states are leading, what states are following and then what states are being most impacted or less impacted so that we can make better policy.</p>
<p class="english-text">The other way I put it together is an interesting thing about having a very diverse district is you start to learn how similar people are. You know, everybody wants the same thing. They want inflation to be at target. They want to have economy that's sustainably thriving, that's sustainably available. They want to be rationally inattentive to inflation and whether the economy is going to be pushed into a recession. They just don't want to think about it. And that's a universal truth. It doesn't matter if I'm in Alaska, Hawaii, or Nevada. doesn't matter. Idaho feels the same way as California in that goal, in that sense. And so I can go and see to that point, are people nervous? Are they optimistic? Are they cautiously optimistic? Today I see concerns, but when you really push them, and this is true across the 12th district, people are cautiously optimistic. Some cities have more cranes than others, but everybody's got a crane.</p>

### AI浪潮的扩散：从后台到前沿
Joe：上次你来纽约上我们播客时，我们聊了一点关于人工智能的话题。你代表着世界上最先进人工智能模型的故乡。当你在这里与许多这些所谓的传统行业交流时，你是否和他们谈论或听到任何关于技术扩散，比如这些技术的实施情况？你有没有从中发现什么有趣的事情？

Mary：当然有。让我先从我发现的最有趣的事情说起，然后再扩展到其他我想谈的事情。我想特别提一下小企业。小企业遍布阿拉斯加，它们可能地处偏远。对它们来说，要进入非本地区域的市场在物理上很困难。在其中一些地方，它们的劳动力供应通常有限，或者说小企业普遍如此。你正在应对成本上升，所以你想保持你的劳动力组合规模较小，于是他们转向人工智能来做一些事情，以增强他们的产出，因为他们正在增强自己的技能。这样他们可以节省时间。

Mary：你可以通过向一个AI模型提问来撰写一份营销计划。输入你的信息，问它“你能写一份营销计划吗？”你就已经领先一步了。你能帮我写一份路演文稿吗？你能告诉我，对于我想销售的产品，美国最好的五个市场是哪里吗？所有这些都让事情变得更好。而且这不仅限于那种营销和增长销售。它实际上也关乎我能否用不同的方式做事。我们曾与一家小型制造公司交谈，不在阿拉斯加，但我在这里也听到了同样的事情。他们说：“我们能够利用AI，根据我们30年来制作过的所有计划的历史，为客户要求我们加工的这个小零件起草初步方案。”这些就是我开始看到正在普及的事情。

Mary：然后，如果你是阿拉斯加的一家大企业，你会像全国任何其他公司一样，想要利用AI来确保自己不落后并获得竞争优势，对吧？这些工具很有帮助，而且不仅仅是关于更快地阅读邮件或起草一份文件。它关乎真正思考你的核心业务。我能用AI做什么来帮助我节省时间，并在我们经常面临劳动力短缺的情况下，增强我现有的劳动力？

Tracy：你对AI总体上是怎么看的？我之所以问这个问题，是因为我们的一位常客嘉宾尼尔·杜塔（Neil Duta）今天在我们的新闻通讯中写了一篇客座文章，他谈到住房市场面临压力，消费者也面临压力，然后美国经济中还有第三个大趋势，那就是对AI的大规模投资热潮。在某种意义上，感觉AI投资热潮与消费者的健康状况以及经济中正在发生其他事情非常脱节。你如何将其纳入货币政策的考量，以及你对整体情况的感受？

Mary：AI投资热潮看起来确实与……你只要看看股票市场的价格和估值就知道了，对吧？如果你看看那些投资于AI开发或AI支持的公司，它们看起来与那些从事主流制造业的公司不同。这是事实。但我不认为这是一种利益冲突。我认为这是一种结构性发展，它会持续下去。而在另一边，你有经济的周期性方面。人们确实感到压力。他们一直在应对高通胀，当然，通胀正在下降，这是个好消息，但物价水平仍然较高。他们现在正处理工作保障问题，比如即使他们不会真的失业或裁员就在眼前，他们也会感到紧张，他们也说自己很紧张。所以你能感觉到那种“我不确定未来会怎样”的成分。

Mary：我不认为这两件事是相互竞争的，更多的是我们必须在货币政策中管理周期性动态，而且在很多方面，有新事物即将出现并且可能很有用，这是非常好的。我现在的问题是，公司部署和推广这项技术的速度是否更快，从而抵消了他们对劳动力市场紧张的一些担忧？我确实看到了一点点这种情况。但大多数情况下，我看到的是，我们如何能更快、更好、更便宜地前进？我们如何提升自己的水平而不增加成本？事实上，我们如何降低成本？而AI成为了他们可以尝试的东西。

Mary：你知道，一年前我们谈话时，或者也许是六个月前，我们作为新兴技术经济研究网络的一部分，正在举办这些CEO圆桌会议。我们在所有业务类型中都做了很多这样的会议，他们当时说，我们不会在前端业务中这样做。我们不会在我们的主要产品线中这样做。我们只会在后台业务中做。现在，它正在向前端转移。哦，这告诉你有些事情正在改变。我问过一个人为什么，他说，这比你想象的要容易得多。我们可以自己训练模型。我们可以通过检查来防止幻觉。所以现在他们感觉更自在了。

Joe：我觉得过去6个月模型质量的变化确实非常显著。

Mary：非常显著。

Joe：而且，像许多关于幻觉的担忧，它们仍然存在，但与6个月前你玩最先进的模型时相比，今天它们似乎已经不是那么大的问题了。话虽如此，你谈到这是一个潜在的生产力增强器，你说它“即将到来”，或者我忘了你确切的用词，公司正在“尝试”它。截至今天，感觉并不像是，好吧，我们已经看到了一些巨大的、整体经济范围内的生产力增长。然而，我们确实看到的是，非常高的电价，也许数据中心起到了一些作用。根据ISM的数据，电子元件或那些非常精密的变压器仍然持续短缺，资本需求非常大，而此时AI尚未带来全经济范围的生产力增长。现在是否存在一种挤出效应，或者说所有那些尚未获得回报的投资带来了负生产力？

Mary：你知道，总会有这种不连续性，用经济学术语来说，但你总会等待你正在投资的技术产生收益。这需要时间。而这项技术的需求，特别是像AI这样耗电巨大的技术，正值我们也在努力实现电网现代化，因为在美国各地，部分电网根本没有得到维护。所以，我们的董事会和理事会里有很多电力公司的CEO，他们总是告诉我们，获得一个变压器需要很长时间，因为存在瓶颈。现在，他们又在担心变压器及其组件的关税问题。然后他们还要与数据中心的需求和公司竞争，说：“我干脆自己建发电厂来支持这个。”所以，这是一个为小得多的电力足迹而发展的市场，现在必须迅速扩大。这需要时间。

Mary：而AI技术的收益才刚刚开始显现。我们还没有看到它们在生产力数据中体现出来。公司可能已经实现的一些轻易可得的胜利可能已经过去了，或者你知道，你会想，我需要两个文案编辑还是一个？如果我有一个文案编辑和AI，我就没问题了。但这些都是轻易可得的胜利，对吧？真正具有变革性的生产力提升，来自于我们甚至还没有真正想到的东西。你知道，我总是用最初的iPhone或智能手机与黑莓对比的例子。当它刚出来的时候，我想，这只是一个更花哨的黑莓。但最终，我当然完全错了。这是一项更具变革性的技术，因为我们在这项技术的基础上开发了新的东西。

<p class="english-text">Joe: when we last had you on the podcast when you were coming through New York City and we talked a little bit about about AI and you represent the home of the most advanced AI models in the world when you're out here talking to many of these sort of old school industries do you talk to them or hear anything about tech diffusion like the implementation of these and is there anything interesting that you've picked up on that</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: absolutely let me start with the most interesting thing I picked up and I'll expand it to the other things I I want to give a shout out to the small businesses so small businesses are they can be remote across Alaska. It's hard for them physically to reach marketplaces that are not in their immediate area. They often have limited workforce availability in some of these places or just small businesses in general. You're dealing with rising costs and so you want to keep your portfolio of labor small and they turn to AI to do things that augment their output because they're augmenting their skills. So it's a they can save time.</p>
<p class="english-text">They can do. You can write a marketing plan by asking one of the AI models. Here's my inputs. Can you write a marketing plan? And already you're ahead. Can you write me a pitch deck? Can you write me, can you tell me the five best marketplaces in the United States for the products I want to sell? All of this makes it better. And it's not li it's not limited to the just that kind of marketing and growth sales. It's actually also about can I do things differently. So, we were talking to a small manufacturing firm, not in Alaska, but I'm seeing hearing the same things here that said, "We're able to use AI to do first drafts of plans based on the 30-year history of all plans we've ever made to create this one small part that someone asked me to machine." So, those are the kinds of things that I'm starting to see spread.</p>
<p class="english-text">Then if you're a larger business here in Alaska, you want to use AI just like any other company in the nation to make sure you're not falling behind and get a competitive edge, right? These things, these tools are helpful and it's not just about reading your emails faster or writing a draft of something. It's about really thinking about your core business. What can I do with AI that helps me save time and helps me augment my existing workforce when we have often a workforce shortage?</p>
<p class="english-text">Tracy: H how are you thinking about AI generally? And one of the reasons I asked this is because one of our frequent guests, Neil Duta, was writing a guest piece in our newsletter today and he was talking about how there's pressure on the housing market. There's pressure on consumers and then you have this third big trend in the US economy, which is this massive investment boom in AI. And in some sense it feels like the AI investment boom is very very divorced from the health of the consumer and other things going on in the economy. How are you factoring that into I I guess monetary policy and how you feel about things more generally?</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: Well, it's very true that the AI investment boom doesn't look like the you just look at stock market braces and valuations, right? If you look at the companies that are invested in AI development, they look different than or AI support, they look different than the companies that are doing mainline manufacturing. I mean, this is a fact. But I don't see that as a competing interest. I see that as that's a structural development that's just going to keep going. And then on the other side, you have the cyclical aspects of the economy. And people do feel stressed. They've been dealing with high inflation and it's coming down, of course, which is great news, but still the price levels higher. They're dealing now with job security issues like whether maybe even if they're not it's not true that they'll lose their job or a layoff's around the corner. They're nervous and they say they're nervous and so you know you sense that I'm not sure about the future kind of component.</p>
<p class="english-text">I don't see those two things as competing as much as we have to manage in monetary policy the cyclical dynamics and it's very good in many ways that there's something coming down the pipe that could be useful. The question I have right now is are companies deploying the technology and diffusing it at a more rapid rate that offsets some of the concerns they had about tight labor market and I am seeing a little bit of that. But mostly what I'm seeing is how are we going to go forward faster, better, cheaper? How are we going to up our game and not raise our cost? In fact, how are we going to get cost down? And AI becomes something they can try.</p>
<p class="english-text">And you know a year ago when we talked or whenever that maybe it was only six months ago when we talked we were doing these CEO roundts as part of our emerging tech economic research network. So we do a lot of these across all business types and they were saying we're not doing it in front office operations. We're not doing in our main product lines. We're only going to do back office. Now it's moving to the front. Oh that tells you something's changing. One of the things that I asked somebody why and they said it's just a lot easier to do it than you think. And we can discipline the models ourselves. We can prevent hallucination by checking. So now they feel more comfortable.</p>
<p class="english-text">Joe: I feel like the change in model quality in the last 6 months is really remarkable.</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: It isarkable and just and like many of the concerns about hallucinations, they still exist, but they seem much less of a problem today than even 6 months ago when you were playing with the most advanced models.</p>
<p class="english-text">That being said, you said you talked about here's this potential productivity enhancer and you said I don't coming down the pike or I forget exactly the term companies are trying it. As of today, it doesn't feel like okay, we've seen some great product general economywide productivity gains. However, what we do see is um very high electricity prices, maybe data centers playing some role. There's still per the ISM continual shortages of electronic components or these very intense transformers very intense capital demands at a time when AI hasn't delivered economywide productivity gains. Could there be an element where there's like a crowding out element right now or like disproivity from all that investment that hasn't paid off yet?</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: You know, there's always going to be this discontinuity, put in a time economist term, but there's always going to be this discontinuity where you're waiting for the proceeds of a technology you're investing in. Those take time and the needs of that technology, especially something as power intensive as AI at a time when we're also trying to modernize the power grid because some of it just hasn't been maintained across the United States. So, we have a number of power company CEOs on our boards and councils and they're always telling us it takes so long to get a transformer because there's bottlenecks. Now, they're worrying about tariffs on transformers and are the components of transformers. Then they're competing with data center needs and companies and saying, "I'll just build my own power to support this." And so, that's just a marketplace that was developed for a much smaller footprint in power and now has to ramp up. That's going to take time.</p>
<p class="english-text">and the proceeds from AI technology are just nent. We're just not seeing them come through in productivity. Some of the easy wins that a company might have done probably are behind us or you know you think okay do I need two copy editors or one well if I have one copy editor in AI I'm okay but those are easy wins right the real transformational type of productivity things are for things we haven't even really thought of yet you know I always use this example of thinking about the original iPhone or smartphone against the Blackberry so when it came out I'm like this is just a fancier Blackberry and then ultimately of course I was totally wrong. This was a much more trans just transformational technology because we developed things on that technology.</p>

### 宏观经济情绪与个人感受的脱节
Tracy：我仍然怀念黑莓。

Joe：我也是，公开承认。

Tracy：我过去常常直接在黑莓上写稿。

Joe：我可以在黑莓上打出整部史诗小说，但我的拇指有问题，它们会在中间碰到一起。我现在用的是迷你版，效果不好。

Tracy：好的。回到整体的“感觉”上来，这次谈话中已经多次出现一个观点：如果你问人们对经济的看法，他们会说“哦，不太好”。如果你问他们对自己个人经济状况的看法，他们会说自己还不错。就像之前关于关税的观点一样，企业会说“我们非常担心”，但另一方面，他们似乎还没有改变他们的实际行动。你对我们为什么总是看到这种脱节有什么论断或理论？

Mary：顺便说一下，这种脱节并不罕见。历史上，人们并不总是这样，但当他们对国家经济发展感到担忧时，他们会通过糟糕的情绪来表达。当有很多转变时，对吧，想想我们正在经历的变革。我们正在努力降低通胀，这很累人；我们正在考虑将制造业和其他产业带回美国；我们正在考虑部署一支由国内驱动的劳动力队伍。这些都是巨大的变革，而此时人们正看着他们的一些邻居说：“我看到乔买的东西少了。他今年没买新车。他每年都买新车的。”这带来了很大的压力。

Mary：但就他们自己的个人情况而言，他们仍然能够去杂货店，能为孩子买东西，能投资修理房屋或去度假，所以他们感觉还行。他们也对自己的工作感到个人安全，但他们担心更广泛的劳动力市场。我认为这很自然。我的理论是，当有这么多变化时，人们会感到担忧，不管他们是否认为这些变化是好的，他们就是会担心。他们担心我们正站在……有个人是这么说的：“我担心我们正站在一个悬崖边上。我喜欢这里的风景，因为我向外看，我很好，但你知道，任何事情都可能发生。”所以我认为那个“任何事情都可能发生”的部分让他们感到紧张。这也是为什么要出来和人们交谈的另一个原因。当我和人们交谈时，我说，这是我们正在做的事情，如果经济看起来有点不稳，我们会这样处理，这会有所帮助。

<p class="english-text">Tracy: I still miss the Blackberry.</p>
<p class="english-text">Joe: Me too. Openly.</p>
<p class="english-text">Tracy: Yeah, I used to file stories just on the Blackberry.</p>
<p class="english-text">Joe: I could type entire epic novels on a Blackberry and I've got the thumb problem of the thumbs meet in the middle. I'm on a mini. It's not working.</p>
<p class="english-text">Tracy: Okay. So, just going back to the vibes more generally, one thing that's already come up multiple times in this conversation is the idea that if you ask people what they think about the economy, they say like, "Oh, it's not great." If you ask them what they think about their own personal economic situations, they say they're fine. And to the point about the tariffs earlier, businesses will say, "We're very worried." But on the other hand, they don't seem to be changing their actual activity just yet. What's your thesis or your theory for why we keep getting that disconnect?</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: So, this is not an uncommon disconnect by the way. People have been historically and not all the time of course, but when they have concerns about the national economic progress, they will tell you in poor sentiment. And when there's a lot of transition, right, just think of the transformations we're going through. We're trying to bring down inflation, which has been tiring, trying to think about bringing manufacturing and other things back to the United States. Thinking about deploying a workforce that's domestically driven. Those are big transformations at a time when people are looking at some of their neighbors and saying, "I see Joe buying less things. He didn't get a new car this year. He always gets a new car." That's a lot of pressure.</p>
<p class="english-text">And so, but their own personal situation, they're still be able to go to the grocery. They can buy something for their kids. they can invest in repairing their home or going on a vacation and so they feel okay and they also feel personally secure in their job but they're worried about the broader labor market and I think that's natural and my theory is that when there's so much change people get worried it doesn't matter if they think the change is even good they just get worried and they're worried that we're standing on one person put it this way I'm worried we're standing on a precipitous cliff I love the view because I'm looking out I'm fine but you know anything can happen and so I think that anything can happen piece makes them nervous which is one of the reasons another reason to come out and talk to people is when I talk to people I say here's what we're doing it and here's how we would handle something if we did look a bit tippy in the economy and that helps.</p>

### 央行的挑战：应对不确定性与政治压力
Joe：你刚才在阿拉斯加发表了一场演讲，就在我们录制这期节目之前，你在演讲中说了一些有趣的话。我现在忘了具体是什么了，但大意是事情虽然不同，但又没有那么不同，或者说过去人们也经历过变革时期。

Tracy：哦，对了，是这个意思：基本上，是的，事情非常不确定，但这就是中央银行的故事。

Mary：这确实是中央银行的故事。如果你要写一本关于中央银行的小说，或者再做一个关于中央银行的播客……

Joe：好像从来没有一个时期是“哦，我们知道发生了什么，我们搞定了，我们知道未来会是什么样子”。

Mary：完全正确。就拿我在美联储的这段时间来说吧。我们经历了9/11，那是一个极度不确定和创伤的时期。然后我们经历了全球金融危机，那是一个持续数年的极度不确定时期。然后是疫情，那在我们历史上也不是一个非常确定或清晰的时期。所以现在我们面临不确定性，但这并不是我们不擅长处理的事情。所以我认为，向人们保证的重要一点是，我们不会等到情况明朗才采取行动，因为如果我们真的等到情况明朗才行动，我们就会一直落后。

Tracy：有一件事似乎是新的，至少在我有生之年是这样，可能如果你在1970年代活过就不是了，那就是对美联储的政治压力。我们当然看到了一些来自特朗普总统的例子，他毫不掩饰地表达了他希望看到的利率水平。你如何应对这种情况？

Mary：你知道，在我们的历史上，有很多时期都存在要求调整利率的压力，因为这当然是总统、政府或国会希望看到美联储采取的方向。但这就是为什么美联储是独立的，因为最终国会赋予我们货币政策的职责，这样我们就可以做出超越任何特定政府、独立于政治活动或政治计划的决策。所以这些是美联储的优点。

Mary：最终，如果你在联邦储备系统工作，特别是如果你是联邦储备系统的领导层，无论是联邦储备银行行长还是理事，你几乎就像在接受这份工作时宣誓一样。这基本上是你誓言的一部分，你将制定服务于所有美国人的货币政策，并且方式不受任何一方政治倾向的影响。所以，我使用相同的信息、相同的模型和来源，做出相同的决策。当然，模型和来源会根据我们所处的经济状况而改变，但我们刚才谈到的流程，这个流程保持不变。保持好奇心，尽可能多地了解情况。永远学习。然后做出一个你认为正确的，我们集体认为对国家和前景是正确的决定。然后有足够的谦逊，可以问自己“我们做出的决定正确吗？我们还需要学习什么才能做出更好的决定？”我认为这总是有效的，而且这能抵御政治压力，因为最终我每天醒来都知道我的工作是为美国人服务的，这就是我为之工作的人，也是我们所做的事情。

<p class="english-text">Joe: So, you just gave a speech here in Alaska right before we're recording this episode and you said something interesting in your speech. I now I'm forgetting Dr. But something about things are different but they're not that different or that in the past this is not the first time people have felt periods of change or</p>
<p class="english-text">Tracy: or it's not the first time that central banks have had to deal with oh that's right that's what it was that basically yes things are very uncertain but this is the story of central banking</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: it is indeed the story of central banking if you were going to write a novel or do a whole another podcast on central banking</p>
<p class="english-text">Joe: like there's never been a time where it's like oh we know what's going on we've got this we know what the future looks like</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: exactly I mean just let's think of my time at the Fed so far. So we had 9/11 that was pretty uncomfortably uncertain and traumatic at the same time. Then we had the global financial crisis that is a tremendous period of uncertainty that lasted a number of years. Then there was the pandemic that was not a very certain or clear time in our our history and so now we have uncertainty but it is not something that we are unpracticed at. So I think that's why the important point to reassure people on is we don't wait for clarity before we act because if we did wait for clarity before we act we would be constantly behind.</p>
<p class="english-text">Tracy: One thing that does seem to be new, at least in my lifetime, possibly not if you were alive in the 1970s, but political pressure on the Fed, and we've certainly seen some instances of that coming from President Trump who has not been shy about saying what he would like to see in terms of interest rates. How are you dealing with that?</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: You know, we do have many periods in our history where there's been pressure to move the interest rate because of course that would be part of the way the president or the administration or Congress would like to see the Fed go. But that's why the Fed is independent because ultimately Congress gave us the monetary policy responsibilities so that we could make decisions that go past any particular administration that are independent of political activities or political plans. So those are good things about the Fed.</p>
<p class="english-text">and ultimately if you take a job at the Federal Reserve and especially if you're in leadership of the Federal Reserve, Federal Reserve bank president or governor, you have to almost like tap a stone when you take the job. It's part of the part of your oath basically that you're going to make monetary policy that serves all Americans and in a way that is not influenced by political leanings one way or another. So, I make the same decisions using the same information, using the same models and sources. Of course, the models and sources change depending on the kind of condition we're in in the economy, but the process, we talked about process a moment ago, the process remains the same. Be curious, figure out as much as you possibly can. Always learn. Then take a decision that you think is right, that we collectively think is right for the nation and the outlook. and then it have enough humility that you can ask the question did we make the right decision and what more do we need to learn to make a better one and I think that always works and that's that's immune to political pressure because ultimately I get up every day knowing that my work serves Americans that's who I work for and that's what we do.</p>

### 数据质量与另类数据源的重要性
Joe：你刚才提到，如果你等待明确的证据，可能就太晚了，尤其是在劳动力市场方面，一旦它下滑，历史表明它往往会持续下跌。上周是美联储会议，没有加息，然后周五我们得到的就业报告不仅令人失望，还有重大的修正。修正是常事，但……Tracy写了很多关于这个的文章，我们也做了一些节目，公众调查的回复率下降了。有人担心我们是否需要一轮新的投资，但这些是你驾驶飞机时的主要仪表，对吧？这是否让事情变得更难了？你是否担心你对数据的可见度质量目前不是最优的？

Mary：你知道，我会用一个稍微不同的说法，而不是“主要仪表”。我认为它们是“关键仪表”，但我们一直在扩大我们的监测仪表组合，实际上是从全球金融危机之后开始的。因为你在全球金融危机中学到的是，你仅仅看这些主要系列数据是无法获得足够信息来真正了解情况的。然后我们在疫情期间当然也必须这样做，我们得到了所有这些实时系列数据，我们使用OpenTable数据、交通流量、有多少人外出、是公共交通流量等等。

Mary：所以我想说的是，有两件事我一直在思考。我们在全球范围内因我们的数据收集、数据连续性和数据完整性而备受尊敬。这三件事对任何试图追踪情况的国家都至关重要，不仅是对美联储，对包括州和地方在内的各级政策制定者，对需要了解经济状况以便纳入其销售预测的企业也是如此。因此，确保我们对这些信息进行足够的投资，确保我们知道它的重要性，我认为是一个至关重要的目标。

Mary：另一方面，我并不仅仅依赖这些信息。重要的是，由于我们现在正处于一个转折点，一个过渡点，感觉像是一个转折点，经济正在放缓，通胀因为限制性利率而下降，我们正在努力实现**软着陆**（Soft Landing: 指在抑制通胀的同时避免经济陷入衰退的政策目标），数据总是波动的。在任何转折点，数据都是波动的，无论我们是从衰退转向扩张，你都会错过就业增长。当你下降时，你往往会错过就业损失或净损失。所以这是我现在已经熟悉的事情。我做这个已经有一段时间了，我知道这会发生。周五的变化幅度与前一周相比相当大。这是调查回复率的问题吗？是季节性调整因为情况不同了吗？还是有其他事情在发生？我相信**BLS**（Bureau of Labor Statistics: 美国劳工统计局，负责发布关键就业和通胀数据）会解开这个谜团，给我们一些答案。

Mary：但你知道，最终关于回复率，当人们问我是否会回应公共调查时，他们对公共机构失去了一些信心，也许是很多信心。所以对我来说，真正的行动呼吁是，美联储并非所有公共机构，但我们应该尽自己的一份力，向人们展示，与人们交谈，去和批评者说，你到底不信任什么，然后讲述我们的故事。也许他们会提出一些我们应该倾听的事情，并基本上倾向于这个想法，即我们为他们做这项工作，我们希望他们相信我们是为他们做的。

Tracy：你能否多谈谈你们可以利用的替代数据来源？因为我经常听到这个说法，好吧，非农就业数据目前似乎有修正问题。也许我们可以看看其他指标。或者，如果CPI价格中被估算或估计的部分比以前更大了，也许我们可以看看别的东西。这些数据源究竟是什么？比如，现在对你来说最有价值的是什么？

Mary：有私人收集的数据。我们谈到了人流量之类的，但还有ADP的就业数据。你可以考虑那个。还有价格项目，你可以看看那些数据。但重要的是，我认为不仅仅是获取其他数据来源，而是学习。比如说，很多CPI价格是估算的。那么我们就需要我们最优秀的统计头脑来思考，如果我把那些没有被估算的价格拿出来，看看它们与长期以来的基础通胀有多相关，我能学到什么？它们是一个好的信号吗？

Tracy：但这是否存在一个信息传达的挑战？我想人们现在已经非常习惯于这样的想法：美联储看到非农就业数据，美联储看到CPI——当然这不是你们首选的通胀指标，但PCE或其他什么。如果你们在看其他东西，或者也许在经济的转折点，其他指标在那个特定时期变得更重要，你们如何沟通你们是如何将这些数据纳入你们的货币政策决策的？因为不是每个人都会和你们看同样的东西。

Mary：我们谈论我们所做的事情，而谈论我们所做的事情的一部分就是说，我们有历史和模型，告诉我们一些关于经济如何运作的信息。我们有新进的信息，我们有所有信息波动的时期，我们可以理解潜在的趋势。然后我们有我们交谈的人。关于周五的就业报告，有趣的是，它在变化方向上更好地匹配了，虽然幅度不同，但它更好地匹配了我一直听到的情况。所以，对于你不确定是否真的准确的数据，一个约束性的方法就是你从人们那里听到的。因为人们不会告诉你“我感觉找工作非常非常舒服”，结果却发现就业市场报告很糟糕。他们会告诉你的是，“天啊，外面看起来真的很令人担忧”，然后你得到的就业报告看起来就不像那种快速的就业增长。

Mary-cont：不协调的是之前那个月的快速就业增长。我当时就说，嗯，这真的不是我听到的情况。差距在哪里？我们花了很多时间深入研究和分析。但当就业市场报告被修正后，我就觉得，好吧，这更有道理了。即使方向……即使幅度与我可能认为我们会前进的方向大相径庭，我认为变化的方向是准确的。

<p class="english-text">Joe: you made this point about how like if you know if you wait for the clear evidence it may be too late especially with the respect to the labor market once it slips history says it tends to fall. Last week it was the Fed meeting where there was no rate move and then Friday we got a jobs report that was not only disappointing, significant revisions and revisions are a common thing but um and Tracy's been writing a lot about this and we've done some episodes response rates to public surveys have gone down. There are concerns about whether you know we need a fresh jolt of investment but these are the main instruments right that you are looking at when you're piloting the plan etc. Is this making it harder? Like, do you have concerns about that the quality of your visibility into the data is suboptimal right now?</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: You know, I'm going to put it slightly differently than main instruments. I think they're key instruments, but we've been broadening our portfolio of instruments for monitoring for really since the GFC, since the global financial crisis because what you learn in the global financial crisis is you're not going to get enough information just looking at these main series to really know what's going on. Then we had to do that of course in the pandemic and we got all these real time series we were using open table data traffic how many people were going out or is it is it transit traffic etc.</p>
<p class="english-text">So what I would offer is this there's two things that I think about we are revered have been revered across the globe for our data collection and our data continuity and our data integrity. Those three things are important to any nation that's trying to follow things and not just the Federal Reserve, but to policy makers across the board, including states and localities, to businesses who need to know what does the economy look like so they can put it into their sales projections. And so making sure that we're investing enough in those that information, making sure we know how important it is, I think is an essential goal.</p>
<p class="english-text">On the other side, I'm not simply relying on those pieces of information. And importantly, since we're in a turning point right now, kind of a by a transition point, it feels like a turning point where the economy is slowing, inflation's coming down because of restrictive interest rates, and we're we're trying to achieve that soft landing that the data are always volatile. They're volatile on any turning point, whether we're turning from a downturn into an expansion, you miss the job growth. when you come down, you tend to miss the job loss or the net losses. So, that's something I'm always I'm familiar with at this point. I've been doing this for a while. I know that's going to happen. The magnitude of the changes is pretty severe on Friday from the week before. Is that survey response? Is that seasonal adjustments because things are different or is that something else going on? I trust the BLS will unpack that and give us some answer about that.</p>
<p class="english-text">But you know ultimately on the response rates you know I say that when I ask people would you respond to a public survey they've lost a little confidence in public institutions maybe a lot of confidence in public institutions and so the real call to action here for me is it is part you know the Federal Reserve is not all public institutions but we should do our part to demonstrate to people and to talk to people go to the critics and say what is it that you're not trusting and then tell our story. Maybe they have things that they're going to bring that we should listen to and basically lean into this idea that we do this work for them and that we want them to trust that we're doing it for them.</p>
<p class="english-text">Tracy: Can you talk a little bit more about the alternative data sources that are available to you? Because I hear this a lot, this idea that okay, well, payroll seems to have a revision problem at the moment. Maybe there are other indicators we could look at. Or if a larger chunk of CPI prices are being imputed or estimated than they were previously, maybe there's something else we can look at. What exactly are these data sources? Like what is most valuable to you right now?</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: So there's privately collected data. We talked about foot traffic and things, but there's the ADP employment data. You can think about that. There's the prices project. You can look at those data. Importantly though, I think it's not just getting other sources of data. It's learning. So say that a lot of the CPI prices are imputed. Then we need to bring our best statistical minds to think about if I take the ones that aren't imputed and I look at how correlated they are with underlying inflation over time, what do I learn? Are they a good signal?</p>
<p class="english-text">Tracy: Is there a messaging challenge here though? If I think people are very used to at this point the idea of the Fed sees the non-farm payrolls number, the Fed sees CFPI obviously isn't your preferred inflation measure, but PCE or whatever. If you're looking at other things or maybe if you're at turning points in the economy and so other indicators become more important at that particular amount of time, how do you communicate how you're factoring in that data into your monetary policy decisions? Because not everyone is going to be looking at the same things as you.</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: We talk about what we do and part of talking about what we do is to say we have history and models that tell us a little bit about how the economy works. We have the incoming information and we have all the periods of time when the information has been volatile and we can understand the underlying trends and then we have the people we talk to and what was interesting about the jobs report on Friday is it better matched in the direction of change not in the magnitude it better match what I've been hearing and so a disciplining device for data that you don't know if they're really accurate is what you hear from people because people do not tell you I feel really really comfortable getting a job only to find out that the job market report is bad. What they will tell you is, boy, it looks really worrisome out there and then you get a jobs report that doesn't look like the rapid job growth.</p>
<p class="english-text">That was the thing that was out of whack. The rapid job growth from the month before is what I said, well really that's not what I'm hearing. What's the gap? And we spent a lot of time digging in and unpacking that. But then when the jobs market report got revised, I was like, okay, that makes more sense. Even if the direction I mean even if the magnitude is vastly different than anything I I probably think we'll go forward I think the direction of change is accurate.</p>

### 长期利率与加密货币的宏观影响
Joe：好的。所以经济正在放缓，正如你所指出的，未来可能会有几次降息。很明显，当你阅读ISM调查时，企业会说“我们需要利率减免”。想买房的人也说“我们想要利率减免”。特朗普总统，可能部分是由于债务利息支付，也希望看到更低的利率。话虽如此，尽管市场已经消化了近期的一些降息预期，但收益率曲线却出现了显著的陡峭化。长端利率并没有下降太多。所以，对我来说，即使你真的降息了，所有这些房主、企业或总统是否能得到他们真正想要的那种利率减免，也并不明显。我很好奇，在你看来，要让曲线的长端发生有意义的变化，需要什么？而很多敏感性都集中在那里。

Mary：我喜欢这个问题，因为我认为很难定期提醒人们，在美联储，我们不是镇上唯一的玩家。我们不控制……我们不是收益率曲线的目标制定者。所以我们不控制所有会移动收益率曲线的因素。移动收益率曲线长端的是，当然，美联储的政策、通胀预期——这些一直很稳定，所以我不认为那是驱动因素。还有地缘政治风险，我们作为一个贸易国或储备货币的形象如何，我们未来的债务预测以及我们认为将如何共同管理这一切。对吧？

Mary：所以现在看起来市场只是在对所有风险做出反应。我们的债务在增加，我们有地缘政治风险，我们不确定我们的贸易伙伴现在对我们感觉如何。然后所有这些都可能成为负担，并且很可能随着时间的推移推高实际利率，对吧？也就是**中性利率**（Neutral Rate of Interest: 指既不刺激也不抑制经济增长的理论利率水平）。所以你看到了这一点，最终美联储可以在短端调整政策，以平衡目标，但我们无法控制收益率曲线的所有方面。

Joe：我知道，因为我听过鲍威尔主席和其他人说过一百万次，“我们不评论财政政策。那不是我们的事。”尽管如此，我还是要……

Mary：你说得对。是的，我知道。

Joe：但是当你描述那些推高长端利率或使其保持高位的各种因素时，会不会是这样：如果没有一些更实质性的财政整顿，就很难让那些利率回到更理想的水平？

Mary：好吧，让我这么说。我们在选举前，在政府更迭前，就在讨论中性利率上升的问题。所以我认为我们应该看看我们经济中正在改变中性利率的基本因素，不仅是在美国，而是在全球。对吧，利率不是国家设定的，我的意思是，我们设定国家利率，但全球利率是全球性的。如果你还记得，在疫情之前和全球金融危机之后，利率，实际利率，一直在下降，通胀低于大多数国家的目标，而且是这种增长缓慢，通胀预期下降。我们该如何管理这种来自长期停滞的停滞？

Mary：然后当然，几乎每个国家的通胀都上升了。我们现在谈论的是实际利率上升，而不是下降。所以我们看到的情况是，名义上的中性利率现在稳定在3%或更高，而不是2.5%。所以这是利率，中性利率的一个相当大的增长。坦率地说，方向似乎是推高它，而不是拉低它。我认为这是我最想向人们解释的地方，那就是降息，如果你认为我们会回到疫情前被认为是中性的利率水平，我认为那不太可能发生。商业房地产人士对此非常敏感。他们一年半前就知道了。市场一年前就知道了。但我认为我们仍在努力让企业和消费者认识到，那些日子我们不太可能回去了，至少在短期内是这样。

Tracy：既然乔问了你一个关于股票财富效应的问题，我也要问一个与加密货币相关的非常类似的问题。因为这实际上是我们上次和你谈话以来变化很大的事情。我的意思是，加密货币价格仍在上涨，这个行业似乎在扩张，本届政府显然对加密货币非常友好。我们是否已经到了加密货币可能从货币政策角度来看变得重要的地步，无论是从情绪角度、财富效应角度，还是从金融稳定角度？当然，作为旧金山联储主席，这也属于你的职责范围。

Mary：我思考加密货币以及关于稳定币和其他事物的对话的方式是这样的。让我们把加密货币和稳定币分开来看。我们把它们放在一个大伞下，人们认为它们是同一回事，但实际上它们非常不同。稳定币是另一种融资方式。所以你可以进行交易，对吧？我可以做跨境交易，我不需要等待，我不需要做货币兑换。所以这些东西只是关于一种技术或创新，它平滑了交易，特别是跨境交易。

Mary：而加密货币是一种资产。它只是一种数字资产。所以你可以投资它，它可以增长，但它也可以下跌。我认为人们对投资其他种类的资产有需求。你不必投资于一家主流的蓝筹公司。你可以投资这个，你可以获得一些收益。所以对我来说，问题总是，我们如何将那种热情，也包括那种风险，纳入我们对金融条件是松是紧以及经济对金融稳定担忧的脆弱性的评估中。所以你问得对，你知道，它现在是否足够大，以至于我们会关注它？我认为它已经足够大，我们会关注它。不是说它今天就很大，所以它很重要。而是它很大，并且在增长。它每次都在变大。

Tracy：是发展的方向。

Mary：是发展的方向。我感觉有点像回到90年代，你可以看到人们在做一些……嗯，也许是2000年代，在互联网泡沫之后，你看到人们在进行网上购物，我们会收集关于在互联网上购买了多少东西的零售统计数据，人们会经常说，那还不够大，不用担心。但你知道，你必须向前看，对吧？它今天可能不够大，但如果你等到它变得巨大，你就没有时间去实践、开发指标、练习你的评估并从中学习。所以我认为，我们现在绝对必须考虑它，并将其作为我们工作的一部分进行评估。好消息是，我们正在评估它，我没有看到这方面有特殊的风险。我认为国会正在做国会应该做的事情，审视参数并说，什么是可行的稳定币流程？我们如何为这类事情设置防火墙？这是你想要的。但美联
储没有那些权力。我们是在我们现有的经济中实施我们的政策，而我们的民选官员正在决定这些交易的参数。

<p class="english-text">Joe: Okay. So there's this slowing and as you indicated some number who knows rate cuts are probably coming in the future. Obviously there businesses when you read them in the ISM surveys I was like we need rate relief. There are uh people who want to buy a house we want rate relief. President Trump obviously maybe in part due to interest payments on the debt wants to see lower rates. That being said, even as the markets priced in some cuts in the near-term future, there's been the s significant steepening of the yield curve. Long-end rates haven't come down that much. So, it's not obvious to me that even if you delivered cuts that all these homeowners or businesses or the president would get the type of rate relief that they actually want. I'm curious like what would it take to in your view to get meaningful change at the long end of the curve which is where a lot of where there's a lot of sensitivity.</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: I love that question because I think it's hard to remind people on a regular basis that we are not the only game in town at the Federal Reserve. We don't control we're not yield curve targeters. So we're not controlling all the things that would move the yield curve. What moves the long end of the yield curve is of course Fed policy inflation expectations. those have been well anchored. So I don't think that's driving them. Geopolitical risks, how our how we're viewed as a trading country or a reserve currency, what our debt looks like going forward in projections and how we think we're going to manage all of that together. Right?</p>
<p class="english-text">So right now it looks like the markets are just reacting to all of the risk. We have rising debt. We have geopolitical risk. We're not sure how our trading partners like us right now. And then all of this could be burdensome and mostly could push up the real rate of interest over time, right? The natural rate of interest or the neutral rate of interest. And so you're seeing that and ultimately the Fed can adjust policy in the short end in a way that's meant to balance the goals, but we can't control all the aspects of the yield curve.</p>
<p class="english-text">Joe: I know because I I've heard Chairman Powell and others say a million times, we don't comment on fiscal policy. That's not our business. Nonetheless, I'm gonna</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: You're right. Yeah, I know. I know.</p>
<p class="english-text">Joe: But when you look when you describe those various factors that push the long end up or keep it elevated, could it be that it will be hard to get those back down to more desirable levels without some more substantial fiscal consolidation?</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: Well, let me say this. we were having these conversations about the rising neutral rate of interest before the election, before the administration changed. And so I think we should look to what are the fundamental factors in our economy that are changing the neutral rate of interest not just in the US but in the globe right the interest rates are not set nationally I mean we've set interest rates nationally but glo interest rates are global if you remember prior to the pandemic interest rates and after the GFC interest rates the real rate of interest was just falling inflation was below most count's targets and it was this sluggish growth inflation expectations are falling. How are we going to manage this stagnation that's going to come from this secular stagnation?</p>
<p class="english-text">Then we of course inflation rises in almost every country. And we're talking about the real interest rate going up, not down. And so we're looking at a place where it settles now at the neutral rate in nominal terms setting settling around three or higher, not at 2.5. So that's a pretty big increase in the in the rate of interest, the neutral rate of interest. And frankly, the direction seems to be pushing it up, not pulling it down. And I think that's where I try to explain to people the most is that interest rate cuts, if you think we're going back to preandemic levels of interest rates that were considered neutral. I don't think that's likely to happen. And that's commercial real estate. Folks are really attuned to this. And they knew that a year and a half ago. Markets are knew that a year ago. But I think we're still working on businesses and consumers to recognize those were not those are not days we're likely to return to at least in in the near term.</p>
<p class="english-text">Tracy: Since Joe asked you a wealth effect from stocks question, I'm going to ask a very similar question in relation to crypto because this is actually something that has changed quite a bit since we last spoke to you. I mean crypto prices are still going up. The industry seems to be expanding. The administration is clearly very very crypto friendly. Are we at the point where crypto perhaps matters from monetary policy either from a sentiment perspective that wealth effect perspective or from a financial stability perspective which of course you know as San Francisco Fed president that's under your mandate as well.</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: So the way I think about crypto and the conversations about stable coins and other things. So let's separate crypto from stable coins for an we put in a big umbrella and people think it's the same but it's actually very different. And so a stable coin is another way to fund yourself. So you can do you can trade, right? It's I can do a crossber transaction. I don't have to wait. I don't have to do currency changes. And so those things are just about a technology or an innovation that smooths out the exchange particularly across borders. The crypto is an asset. This is just it's a digital asset. So you can invest in it and it can grow but it can also decline. And I think there's appetite for other kinds of assets to invest in. you don't have to invest in a mainline blue chip company. You can invest in this and you can get some gains. So the question for me is always how do we incorporate that maybe it's enthusiasm and also that risk into our assessment of how loose or tight are financial conditions and how vulnerable is the economy to financial stability concerns. So you're right to ask, you know, is it big enough now that we would look at it? I think it is big enough we would look at it. It's not that it's big today. So, it's material. It's that it's big and growing. It's getting bigger every time. So,</p>
<p class="english-text">Tracy: the direction of travel</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: the direction of travel. I feel a little bit like back in the '9s, you could see people doing some well maybe really the 2000s after the dotcoms you saw people doing internet purchases and we would collect retail statistics on how many things were bought on the internet and people would regularly say that's not big enough. Don't worry about it. But you know you you have to look ahead right it might not be big enough today but you don't have time to practice and develop metrics and practice your evaluations and learn from that if you wait till it's giant so I think absolutely we have to think about it right now and assess it as part of what we do and the good news is we are assessing it and I don't see special particular risks to this and I think Congress is doing what Congress is supposed to do looking over the parameters and saying what's a a stable coin process that can work how do we ring fence these types of things. That's what you want. But that doesn't have those powers. We're implementing our um policy that in the economy we have and our elected officials are deciding the parameters of those exchanges.</p>

### 货币政策的未来路径与决策逻辑
Joe：我其实只剩最后一个问题了，非常直接的宏观问题。你知道，有些领域明显在放缓等等。你将利率设定的状态描述为仍处于限制性区域，至少是温和限制性的。然而，通胀仍然持久地高于目标，虽然不像几年前那么严重。这是为什么？

Mary：这需要时间。一旦通胀上升，把它降下来就需要时间。你知道，在你完全达到目标之前调整政策的原因是，让我们暂时把关税放在一边，只考虑经济的常规动态。如果你等到看清2%通胀的“眼白”才行动，你就太晚了。因为今天的政策紧缩程度不仅仅是今天利率水平的反映，它也是过去12到18个月利率水平的反映。而它们一直是温和限制性的。所以，它们正在逐渐减缓经济，并逐渐降低通胀。

Mary：我们一直在等待的，至少我一直在等待很长时间的事情，是这种效应开始传导到住房部门。在过去几个月里，它确实已经传导到了。所以这是一个非常大且重要的部门，它的通胀必须下降，我们才能实现2%的目标。所以，如果你开始推断，不包括住房的服务业通胀正在下降，住房通胀正在下降，没有关税的商品部门也在下降，那么所有这些因素都在把你推向2%。我们必须在到达那里之前调整政策，因为记住，我们做的任何事情，如果我们让它完全保持原样，都会在未来12到18个月产生另一个效应。谁知道货币政策的滞后到底有多长？人们唯一能达成共识的是，它有滞后性。

Tracy：就这里的速度重要性而言，如果你得到了劳动力市场显著疲软的确认，50个基点的降息会是选项吗？

Mary：你知道，在中央银行业，这在美联储是如此，但我认为其他中央银行也是如此，你永远不想仅仅因为我们以前没有使用过某个工具就排除它。我们确实以一种激进的方式使用了我们的工具。但不应该把这理解为我认为那是可能的结果。但我确实认为我们应该把我们所有的工具和所有的会议都看作是在任何时候都可以使用的，因为工作不是选择一个每个人都期望你使用的工具。工作是恢复价格稳定，并且在不绊倒劳动力市场、不让人们在通胀降低但没有工作的情况下做到这一点。

Joe：我还有一个最后的问题。美元，你知道，你看看自4月2日以来的很多图表，它们触底了，但随后又反弹了。我们没有在美元上看到这种情况。我很好奇，你知道，人们担心美国的政治连续性、稳定性和制度稳定性。对美联储的攻击是真实存在的，即使这不会改变你日常工作的方式。而美元疲软本身就可能导致通胀，因为我们有进口账单等等。我只是有点好奇，当你思考中期问题时，你如何看待这些？你必须完成你的使命，而这些事情真的在你的控制之外。

Mary：完全在我们的控制之外。

Joe：完全在你的控制之外，但是，当你思考它们如何影响你完成使命时，尤其是在存在这些似乎超出你控制范围的宏观因素的时候，你是怎么想的？

Mary：嗯，你知道，如果你只考虑我们进口商品这个想法。如果这些进口商品的成本上升，无论是由于美元走弱——我们不制定美元政策，我只想说，我们把美元看作是我们世界之外的东西，它只是我们方程式中的另一个输入——还是由于关税，你都要为进口商品支付更多。那么这只会推高通货膨胀率。它会对通胀施加上行压力。所以美联储必须思考，好吧，哪些因素在给通胀制造上行压力，哪些因素在给通胀制造下行压力，我们如何驾驭这一切以达到2%的通胀。这就是工作，无论你是否总是有推高通胀和拉低通胀的因素。我们的工作是把这些因素综合起来，看看剩下的是什么，然后无论剩下的是什么，我们都用利率来实现目标。

Tracy：我很抱... 我还有一个最后的问题。

Mary：我知道会这样的。

Tracy：在某个时候，鲍威尔主席将被替换。我不知道总统是否会试图解雇他，但他的任期将会届满，新的提名人将会出现。从一个地区联储主席的角度来看，主席在成功并与联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）其他成员合作方面，需要具备哪些重要品质？

Mary：你知道，我认为你可以是一个地区联储主席，你可以是在联邦储备系统工作的任何人，你也可以仅仅是美国的一个公民。一个深切关心国家走向的人。要求总是一样的。你把别人放在自己之上。你考虑的是服务于美国人民的决策。你毫不畏缩地这样做。如果批评来了，只要你正在做，并且你正在利用你的委员会，并且你正在得出一个你认为是为美国人民最好的判断，那就是一个重要的品质。

Mary：另一个重要的品质是倾听。我们从各种各样的人、企业、社区、市场那里得到的各种输入的多元性，这很重要。人们对事物所持有的不同看法或视角，说“嗯，我不那样看世界”，这也很重要。任何领导者，无论他们领导什么，要想成功，都必须能够倾听。这是我个人的信念。你必须倾听。你必须知道你知道什么，你把最好的想法提出来。你必须愿意倾听批评或支持。然后你必须反过来问人们，让我们利用这种分歧来为我们服务，而不是把它当作分裂的方式。我认为，从历史上看，这就是最成功的美联储主席所具备的。但老实说，这也造就了一个成功的委员会成员。我们都必须抱着这样的想法去参与，这不是关于我们自己。这是关于我们所服务的人民。我们知道他们是谁，那就是美国人民。

Joe：Tracy，我们应该竞选美联储主席。我们所做的就是倾听。

Tracy：基本上就是这样。

Mary：但然后你确实必须做决定。

Tracy：好吧，我们在这方面不太擅长。好的，玛丽·戴利，非常感谢你再次来到 Odd Lots。

Mary：我的荣幸，我很高兴我们在阿拉斯加完成了这次访谈。

<p class="english-text">Joe: I think I actually just have one more question and it's very sort of straight down the middle macro, but you know there's this obvious you know slowing in some areas etc. You've described the state of the interest rate setting as still in restrictive territory, at least modestly restrictive. Yet inflation is still durably above target, not massively the way it was a couple of years ago. Why is that?</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: Takes time. Once inflation gets up, it takes time to bring it down. And you know, the reason you would adjust policy before you totally get there, let's put tariffs aside for a minute and let's just think about the regular dynamics of the economy. If you wait to see the whites of the eyes of 2% inflation, you will be too late. Because policy tightness today is not just a reflection of where interest rates are today. It's a reflection of where interest rates have been over the last 12 to 18 months. And they've been modestly restrictive. So, they're gradually slowing the economy and gradually bringing inflation down.</p>
<p class="english-text">And the thing we had been waiting for, at least I'd been waiting for for a long time, was for this to start showing through to the housing sector. And it has been in the last several months. And so that's a really big and important sector that has to have inflation come down for us to achieve our 2% goal. So if you started extrapolating services inflation excluding housing is coming down, housing's coming down, the goods sector without the tariffs was coming down and so you get all of those things and that's pushing you to 2%. We have to adjust policy before we get there because remember anything we do if we left it exactly where it is has another effect for another 12 to 18 months. Who knows what exactly the lags of monetary policy are? The only thing people can agree with is it has a lag.</p>
<p class="english-text">Tracy: Just in terms of the importance of speed here, if you got confirmation of significant weakening in the labor market, could a 50 basis point cut be on the table?</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: You know, in in central banking, and this is true at the Fed, but I think other central banks as well, you never want to rule out a tool simply because we haven't used it before. And we did use our tools in an an aggressive way. But one shouldn't take that to mean I think that's the likely outcome. But I do think we should think of all of our tools and all of our meetings as being available to us at all times because the job isn't pick a tool that's exactly the one that everybody expects you to use. The job is restore price stability and do it without tripping up the labor market and leaving people with lower inflation but no jobs.</p>
<p class="english-text">Joe: I actually have one one last question. This happens a lot. Well, but uh the dollar, you know, you look at a lot of charts since April 2nd and there's been a it they bottom, but then they jump back up. We haven't seen that with the dollar. And I'm curious, you know, people are concerned about political continuity and stability and institutional stability in the United States. And the attacks on the Fed are real even if the fact that it doesn't change how you do your dayto-day job and dollar weakness could itself be inflationary because we do have an import bill, etc. I'm just sort of curious like how you think about the sort of I guess maybe medium-term when you're thinking about okay you have to hit your mandate these things that are really outside of your control</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: completely outside of our control</p>
<p class="english-text">Joe: completely your control but like how do you think about them in terms of hitting your mandate at a time when yeah there are these sort of like factors that affect macro that seem outside your control.</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: Well, you know, if you take the just take the idea that we import things. If the cost of those imports goes up either because the dollar is weaker. We don't make dollar policy. Just want to say that we take the dollar is outside of our world. It's just another input to our equation. But if you have a weaker dollar and you're paying then more to import things or you have tariffs, so you're paying more to import things, well then that's just going to raise the rate of inflation. It's put upward pressure on inflation. So then the Fed has to think, okay, what are the things creating upward pressure on inflation and what are the things creating downward pressure on inflation and how do we navigate that to get to 2% inflation. That's the job regardless of whether you always have things that are pushing inflation up and pulling inflation down. Our job is to net those things and say what's left and whatever's left we use the interest rate to achieve.</p>
<p class="english-text">Tracy: I'm sorry I have one I have one last question.</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: I knew this was going to happen. I I at some point chairman Paul is going to be replaced. I don't know if the president will try to fire him, but it his term will expire and a new nominee will come up. From the perspective of a regional Fed president, what is an important quality of the chairman in terms of like being successful and working with the rest of the FOMC?</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: You know, I think you could be a regional Fed president. You could be anyone who works at the Federal Reserve in the Federal Reserve system. You could simply be a citizen of the United States. So, someone who cares deeply about how the country goes. And the the requirements are always the same. You put other people first above your own self. You think about decisions that serve the American people. And you do that without flinching. If the criticism comes, as long as you're doing and you're using your committee and you're getting to a judgment that you think is best for the American people, that's an important quality.</p>
<p class="english-text">And the other important quality is to listen. The diversity of the inputs we get from all types of people, businesses, communities, markets, that's important. The disagreements or differences of lens that people put on things and say, "Well, I don't see the world like that." Any leader, no matter what they're leading, has to be able to listen to be successful. That's my personal belief. You have to listen. You have to know what you know, you put your best ideas out there. You have to be willing to listen to criticisms or support. And then you have to turn around and ask people, let's use this disagreement to our advantage as opposed to using it as a way to to divide. And I think that's historically what have made the most successful Fed chairs. But honestly, it makes a successful committee member. We all have to go in with the idea that this is not about us. This is about the people we serve. We know who those are, the American people.</p>
<p class="english-text">Joe: Joe, we should run for Fed chairs. All we do is listen.</p>
<p class="english-text">Tracy: That's basically it.</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: But then you But then you do have to decide.</p>
<p class="english-text">Tracy: All right, we're we're not that good at that. All right, Mary Dailyaly, thank you so much for coming back on Odd Offs.</p>
<p class="english-text">Mary: My complete pleasure and I'm so glad we did it in Alaska.</p>
