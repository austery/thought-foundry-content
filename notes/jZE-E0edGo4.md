### 民主党人呼吁弹劾 Kristi Noem，Ilhan Omar 在明尼苏达州遇袭事件引发关注

从《纽约时报》新闻头条开始，我是 Will Jarvis。今天是周三，一月二十八日。以下是今日报道的重点内容。

ICE（美国移民与海关执法局）无法被改革，也无法被挽救。我们必须彻底废除 ICE。

在明尼苏达州的明尼阿波利斯，民主党众议员 Ilhan Omar 在昨晚召开了一场社区对话会，回应该市正在进行的 ICE 拆迁行动。她代表了城市的部分区域，并要求国土安全部长 Kristi Noem 辞职或面临弹劾。

就在她开始演讲几分钟后，一名男子从观众席中跳出来，向 Omar 身上喷洒了一种带有强烈醋味的液体。安全人员迅速将其制服，警方以袭击罪名逮捕了此人。

美国国会警察（负责调查针对国会议员的威胁机构）表示，此次袭击行为“不可接受”，并承诺将迅速给予正义回应。

Omar 在被护送离开时，仍坚持继续她的活动。她表示：“像这个人一样愚昧的人无法理解我们的现实。我们是明尼苏达州的坚强代表，无论他们对我们做出什么反应，我们都将保持韧性。”

就在袭击事件发生数小时前，特朗普曾在爱荷华州的一场集会上公开发表带有种族主义色彩的言论攻击 Omar，并嘲讽她来自“灾难国家”。他在事后的一次电话采访中称，自己并未观看事件视频，并指责 Omar 可能是故意制造了这起事件。

与此同时，由于联邦特工在明尼苏达州的执法行动引发抗议，两位关键政府官员正面临政治风暴。昨天，众议院民主党领袖表示，国土安全部长 Kristi Noem 必须立即辞职，否则他们将推动弹劾。尽管共和党支持对弹劾持怀疑态度，但民主党的行动可能需要他们的配合才能推进。

此外，《纽约时报》报道指出，特朗普政府已封禁了高级海关与边境保护局官员 Gregory Bo 的官方社交媒体账号。该账号曾用于宣传工作并反驳批评者。

与此同时，一份新的人口普查数据显示，特朗普政府的移民政策对全国人口增长产生了显著影响。从 2024 年中期到 2025 年中期，美国经历了其历史上最慢的人口增长速度。尽管出生率下降是一个长期趋势（持续了近二十年），但移民政策的变化，如南部边境的严格管控、签证获取难度加大以及许多人选择不再来美定居，也是重要原因之一。

这一系列事件反映了当前美国移民政策的复杂影响——从政治到社会，再到经济层面。

From the New York Times, it's the headlines. I'm Will Jarvis in for Tracy Mumford. Today's Wednesday, January 28th. Here's what we're covering.

ICE cannot be reformed. It cannot be rehabilitated. We must abolish ICE for good. In Minneapolis last night, Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar held a town hall meeting to address the ongoing ICE operations in the city, parts of which she represents. And DHS Secretary Christy Nome must resign or face impeachment.

A few minutes after she started talking, a man jumped up from the audience, rushed forward, and used a syringe to spray Omar with a substance that smelled strongly of vinegar.

I don't know. A security officer tackled the man who police arrested on suspicion of assault. The US Capital Police, which investigates threats against lawmakers, said in a statement the attack was unacceptable and would be met with quote swift justice.

Just give me 10 minutes. Just give me 10 minutes.

I beg you. As the man was hauled away, Omar insisted to her staff that she would continue the event.

Here, here is the reality that people like this ugly man don't understand. We are Minnesota strong and we will stay resilient in the face of whatever they might throw at us.

A few hours earlier,

people come in, they have to show that they can love our country. They have to be proud. Not like Ilhan, Omar, did you see what 

President Trump who has repeatedly made inflammatory racist remarks about Omar and her Somali heritage had mocked her at a rally in Iowa. You know, she's always talking about the Constitution provides me with the following. You know, the Constitution, she comes from a country that's a disaster. It's a 

And in a phone interview with ABC News after the attack, Trump, who said he hadn't seen video of the incident, accused Omar of staging it. He said quote “She probably had herself sprayed knowing her.”

Meanwhile, the backlash to the killings by federal agents in Minneapolis this month has now swept up two key administration officials. Yesterday, top House Democrats said that Homeland Security Secretary Christy Gnome should be fired immediately and that if she isn't, they would push to impeach her, though they would need some Republican support to do that. And the Times has learned that the administration has barred Gregory Bo, a senior Customs and Border Patrol officer, from his official social media account. Bavino had used the account to promote his work and hit back at critics. He's been recalled from his assignment in Minnesota as the White House tries to do damage control over the aggressive immigration operations in the state.

And in terms of how the administration's immigration policies have been playing out for the whole country, new data from the Census Bureau shows that Trump's approach has contributed to a sharp slowdown in population growth. According to the numbers, from mid 2024 to mid 2025, the US had one of the slowest growth rates in the country's history.

While part of it is America's declining birth rate, which has been dropping for nearly two decades. Other major reasons include Trump's effective shutdown of the southern border, how hard he's made it to get visas, and the fact that a lot of people are simply choosing not to come to the US at all.

### 税务季开启，IRS 面临挑战，Frankie 一人分饰两角

本周是美国的税务季开端。美国国税局预计将在接下来数周内收到超过一亿四千万份税务申报表。许多美国人也开始焦急等待他们的退税款。

对于 IRS 来说，去年是一个艰难的年份。特朗普政府试图减少联邦雇员数量，导致 IRS 的员工流失了约四分之一。此外，在短短几个月内就有六多位不同的人轮流领导 IRS，这种不稳定性也引发了广泛关注。

为了更深入地了解今年 IRS 的运作情况，我们的同事 Andrew Duran 最近采访了 IRS 局长 Frank Bizignano，并总结出三个关键点。

首先，Bizzy Nano 的任务非常紧迫。共和党去年通过了一项重大减税法案，并希望民众能尽快收到退税，从而认为“共和党为我带来了额外资金”。因此，他今年必须确保一切运作顺利。

其次，Frank Bizigno 具备丰富的支付处理经验。他在加入特朗普政府之前担任一家大型支付公司首席执行官，多年在华尔街工作，擅长确保资金能准确无误地从一处转移到另一处。因此，一些现任及前任 IRS 官员表示对他的能力有信心。

第三点，他并非只担任 IRS 局长一职。他同时还在负责社会保障管理局，并且是该机构经参议院确认的委员长。这意味着他同时在管理两个重要的政府机构。

据我了解，他在 IRS 的办公室中每周大约有两天时间在场办公，并从新泽西州的家中乘坐私人飞机到华盛顿。目前来看，这种安排是极为罕见的——至少在现代史上从未有人同时担任 IRS 局长和社会保障管理局负责人。

This week marks the beginning of tax season in the US when the Internal Revenue Service braces for more than 140 million tax returns to pour in and many Americans start anxiously waiting for their tax refund. It was a really tough year last year for the IRS. They lost roughly a quarter of their staff under the Trump administration's attempts to reduce the size of the federal workforce. More than half a dozen different people led the agency on a kind of almost rotating basis. And so I wanted to sit down with and get to know and understand the guy whose job it is to make the IRS work this year.

My colleague Andrew Duran recently profiled Frank Bizignano, the head of the IRS, and he says there are three key things to know.

The first thing to know about Busy Nano is that the stakes are really high for him over the next 10 weeks because Republicans passed a big tax cut last year and they now want people to get that money. Basically, they're hoping that people get refunds this year notice that they're larger than they have been in the past, and that they say “Oh, Republicans got me this extra money. I like Republicans more now.” And so, Bizzy Nano has this kind of political imperative this year to make it work.

The second thing to know about Frank Bizigno is that he does have a lot of relevant experience in payments processing. He was the CEO of a large payment processing company right before he joined the Trump administration. He spent his whole career on Wall Street kind of making sure money gets from point A to point B. And so there's some confidence among you know current and former IRS officials that I talked to that Bizy Nano is someone who can make it work.

And the third thing to know about him is that it's not the only job that he's doing right now. He is also running the Social Security Administration. He is the Senate confirmed commissioner of that agency, which is also a very large and consequential agency. I mean when I talked to him about this he said that you know he's done other big jobs at the same time before in his career. From what I've heard, he's at the IRS roughly two days a week physically and he flies there in his private plane from his home in New Jersey. And so yeah it's certainly an unusual situation.

As far as I know there’s never been someone leading the IRS and the Social Security Administration, you know at least in modern times. And so we’ll see if he can handle both jobs at once.

### 新研究揭示乌克兰战争的惨烈代价，一名 GPS 关键贡献者离世

一项新研究表明，乌克兰战争已经造成了近 180万士兵伤亡或失踪。其中乌军死亡人数估计在十万到十四万人之间，尽管乌克兰并未公布官方数据。

俄罗斯的伤亡人数被认为被低估了。由于其在战场上的人力是乌克兰的三倍多，因此每战损失也更为严重。据估计，俄方每月有约 35 千名士兵死亡或受伤。

尽管战争已经持续四年，但前线的进展几乎为零。近两年来，俄罗斯仅占领了乌克兰领土的额外百分之一点五。

与此同时，在 2018 年，一位名叫 Gladys West 的数学家去世。她是 GPS 技术开发的关键人物之一。

West 在 20世纪50年代初加入了海军，当时她是整个设施中仅有的四位黑人数学家中的一员。她后来领导了一组科研人员精确测量地球的形状，包括潮汐力和海洋曲率等复杂因素。这项工作为 GPS 的精确性奠定了基础。

尽管她的贡献至关重要，但 West 自己从未向家人透露过。她甚至在 20世纪60年代时仍然坚持使用纸质地图导航。

A new study published yesterday shows the staggering human toll of the war in Ukraine. According to the report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the total number of Russian and Ukrainian troops killed wounded or missing during four years of war has now climbed to almost one million eight hundred thousand soldiers have been getting killed or injured every month.

The massive loss of life comes as things have largely stalled on the front lines. In the past two years of fighting Russia has only managed to seize an additional one point five percent of Ukrainian territory.

And finally,

I never would have thought that I could sit in a car and you know says turn left turn right. I know Glattis West, a mathematician whose work was critical in developing GPS has died at age ninety-five.

Despite the fact that many Americans rely on the tech everyday her role in it went unrecognized for nearly all of her life West was born in a town of sharecroppers in Virginia in nineteen thirty. And when she started her career in the Navy in the fifities she was one of only four black mathematicians at the whole facility there She went on to lead a group that calculated the precise shape of the planet accounting for things like tidal forces and curvature of oceans That helped her find accuracy GPS Flash forward to two thousand eighteen.

West had never even told her own children about her work in part because some of it had been classified in part because that just wasn't her style When a fellow alum from her sorority offered to help get her story out there by contacting a local newspaper reporter West asked her “Do you think anybody would care?” Notably even though GPS the system she helped make possible is now everywhere West herself still preferred paper maps telling the Guardian at one point that she was a hands-on kind of person.
