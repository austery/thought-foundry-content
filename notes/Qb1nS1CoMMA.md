### 个人转变与职业选择

**主持人**: 我刚刚经历了我生命中最大的转变，那就是辞掉了我的公司工作，而且没有任何后备计划。我决定人生太短暂了，不能做那些不能让我充实的事情，要真正地冒险，并且相信自己。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I just went through the biggest change in my life, which was leaving my corporate job with really no backup plan. I decided that life is too short to do something that isn't filling my cup, and to really take a risk and bet on myself.

</details>

**主持人**: 这真的让我不堪重负。我感到精疲力竭。我真的非常精疲力竭，有时感到非常沮丧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: It just became a lot. I was burnt out. I was really burnt out and I was feeling very sad sometimes.

</details>

**主持人**: 所以经过大量的深思熟虑以及与人力资源部和公司的反复沟通，我最终决定是时候离开了，去寻找其他机会了，尽管这意味着我将不得不经历一段关于接下来想做什么的不确定时期。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: So after a lot of deliberation and a lot of back and forth with the HR and the company, I finally decided that it was time for me to move on and look for other opportunities, even though that meant that I will have to go through a period of uncertainty about what I wanted to do next.

</details>

**主持人**: Tricia Williams是**TMU Future Skills Centre**的研究、评估和知识动员总监，她加入了我的访谈。你今天怎么样？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Tricia Williams is the Director of Research, Evaluation and Knowledge Mobilisation at TMU Future Skills Centre, and she joins me in the studio. How are you doing?

</details>

**Tricia Williams**: 非常感谢。我很好。你呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: Thank you so much. I'm great. How are you?

</details>

**主持人**: 我很好。我想听听你对刚才我们看的那个视频的看法。我们听到了“精疲力竭”，听到了“相信自己”这句话，还有“不确定性”。告诉我，当你看到这些视频时，你有什么想法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I'm doing well. I want to get your thoughts on that video that we just watched. We heard burnout. We heard the phrase bet on yourself. Uncertainty. Tell me, what are your thoughts when you see those videos?

</details>

**Tricia Williams**: 哦，当我看到这个时，我看到的是一些年轻人说：“我想要一些与众不同的东西，我要去追求一些机会。”所以，我认为他们是在说他们想要一个更好的未来，无论他们如何定义它。我们知道，总的来说，年轻人——我在这里做一些广泛的概括——现在普遍非常看重工作的质量，比前几代人更甚。这包括拥有**灵活性**，拥有前进的**发展路径**，并且真正地说：“我想为自己创造这些机会。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: Oh, when I see this, I see young people who are saying I want something different for myself and I'm going to pursue some opportunities. So I think they're they're saying that they want a better future for themselves. However they define that. And we know that young people, by and large, like I'm making broad generalizations here, generally tend to value quality of work very highly now, more so than previous generations. And that involves having flexibility, having pathways forward, and really saying, I want to create those kinds of opportunities for myself.

</details>

### 工作中的真实性与价值匹配

**主持人**: **德勤（Deloitte）**的一项调查，研究了23,000名Z世代和千禧一代，发现年轻专业人士正在寻求工作中的**真实性**。请帮助我们理解，当我们谈论“真实性”这个概念时，我们指的是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: The Deloitte survey, which looked at 23,000 Gen Z's and millennials and found that young professionals are looking for more authenticity at work, help us understand what are we talking about when we talk about the concept of authenticity?

</details>

**Tricia Williams**: **德勤（Deloitte）**的研究确实与我们在**未来技能中心（Future Skills Centre）**所做的许多工作相呼应，那些工作关注的是工作质量。我们发表了几篇专门研究年轻人的论文。我们发现，年轻人不希望在个人生活和工作生活之间存在**价值不匹配**。你刚才说的“真实性”这个词，我认为很好地概括了这一点。他们正在寻找机会，既能谋生，也能生活。这包括**心理健康支持**、**工作生活平衡**，或者能够**休假**。这不仅仅是，你知道的，有多少天假期，而是真正感到被支持去做这些事情。我认为，当我们与年轻人进行这项研究时，这些方面得到了非常响亮和清晰的体现——他们正在寻找能够拥有那种生活的途径，而不仅仅是，你知道的，打卡上班，然后拿到薪水。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: The Deloitte study really parallels a lot of work that we've done at the Future Skills Centre, which was looking at quality of work, and we did a few papers that specifically looked at young people. And one of the things we find is that young people don't want to have value mismatch between their personal lives and their work lives. It's really so the word authenticity you said, I think, sums it up very well. It's looking for those opportunities to both make a living, but also make a life. And that involves things that like mental health supports or work life balance or being able to take time off. That's not just, you know, so many days off, but really feeling supported to do those things. And I think we saw those kinds of things come through really loud and clear when we did this research with young people that, you know, they were looking for ways to have that life that wouldn't just be, you know, putting in the time clock, punching their card in and getting a paycheque.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。话又说回来，考虑到目前已建立的工作场所现状，它们如何支持这些目标，这些看似崇高的目标——也许对某些公司或组织来说，我不想说它们“固步自封”，但它们如何支持自己的目标呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Okay. With that being said, with how established workplaces are right now, how can they support those goals, those lofty what seem like for maybe for some companies or organizations that might be, I don't want to say stuck in the past, but how do they support their goals?

</details>

**Tricia Williams**: 是的。不，这很容易说，“哦天哪，现在的年轻人，他们不想努力工作，他们不想做我们做过的事情。”而且，你知道，我有时也有罪过，作为一个管理者，你会想：“我希望你工作，对吧？我希望你做这些事情。”是的，我们可以做到这一切。所以这不是非此即彼，而是“并且”。所以我想说，你知道，我认为我们现在正处于一个巨大的转变之中，从一个工作岗位稀缺的世界，转变为一个技能稀缺的世界。因此，我认为，你知道，越来越多的雇主想要获得他们真正需要的技能来推动业务改进、项目交付和卓越发展。他们将需要在劳动力市场中争夺这些技能。而年轻人拥有许多这些技能。他们拥有令人难以置信的创造力。他们有想法。他们是**AI原生代**。在我们调查过的所有不同群体中，他们是采用人工智能的最高群体。我认为，想要利用这一点的企业和公司将需要考虑做出一些改变来吸引年轻人。这不一定总是困难或昂贵的。所以，我提到了尽可能多的**灵活性**。我知道我们正处于要求重返办公室的时代，但在这方面有任何灵活性吗？也许每周一两天，或者甚至只是偶尔说一句：“我们知道你需要居家办公？”在开始时间或结束时间上是否有任何灵活性，诸如此类的事情——找到那种灵活性和活力， wherever you can.

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: Yeah. No, it's really easy to say, oh my gosh, young people these days, they don't want to work hard, they don't want to do what we did. And you know, I'm guilty sometimes as a manager you're thinking, I want you to work, right? I want you to do these things. And yes, we can do all that. And so it's not either or. It's. And so I'd say, you know, one of the things I think we're in the midst of right now is a whole transition from a world in which, you know, we had a scarcity of jobs to one in which we have a scarcity of skills. And so I think, you know, more and more employers who want to access the skills that they really need to drive their business improvement, to drive their program delivery, to drive excellence. They're going to need to compete for those skills among the labour market. And young people have a lot of those skills. They have incredible creativity. They have ideas. They are AI natives. They are the highest group that is adopting artificial intelligence among any of the different groups we've surveyed. And I think businesses and companies that want to harness that will need to look at making some changes to entice young people. It doesn't always have to be difficult or expensive. So I mentioned flexibility whenever possible. So I know we're in an era of return to office mandates, but is there any flexibility around that? Maybe 1 or 2 days a week or even just say occasionally, we know you're going to need to work from home? If is there any kinds of flexibility on start times or end times, those sort of things like finding that flexibility and dynamism where you can.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。我想更好地理解这一点。我要引用一位多伦多说唱歌手**Drake**的话：“你只活一次”（YOLO）。他在2010年代初期推广了这句话。因为这种观念而辞职，在人们的辞职决定中占有多大比重？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Okay. I want to have a better understanding of I'm going to quote a Toronto rapper, Drake YOLO, you only live once. He popularised that phrase in the early 2010s. How much does quitting because of that sort of concept play into some of the decisions for people to quit?

</details>

**Tricia Williams**: 是的，这是我思考了很多的事情，因为，你知道，像很多人一样，我的生活中也有年轻人。我希望我还是其中之一。有时我不能说我还是了，但我确实看到，你知道，人们会和年轻人谈论这个。“哦，他们只是在过这种‘YOLO’的生活。”我认为年轻人正在做的是说：“我们想要一个更好的**社会契约**。”对。所以是的，我会工作。我会投入时间来发展我的事业。但我想知道，我做了所有这些工作后，能买得起房子吗？或者我甚至买不起公寓吗？我能在周末出去吃饭吗？**可负担性**是其中的关键部分。所以，我认为，你知道，如果有时人们说：“看，我存不了钱，我买不起房子，我只想活在当下。”我的意思是，我们能责怪他们吗？你知道，如果你要努力工作并存钱，但仍然无法过上你梦想的生活，或者你父母为你梦想的生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: Yeah, it's something you know, I've thought a lot about because, you know, like many people, I have young people in my life. I wish I was one of them. Sometimes I can't say that I am anymore, but I, I do see, you know, people talk about this with young people. Oh, they're just doing this YOLO life. What are the things I think young people are doing is saying we want a better social contract. Right. So yes, I will work. I will put time in to make my career. But I want to know, can I buy a house right when I do all that work? Or am I not even going to be able to afford a condo? Can I afford to go out to eat on the weekends? Like affordability is a key part of this. So I think, you know, if sometimes people are saying, look, I can't save, I can't buy a house, I am just going to live in the moment. I mean, can we blame them? You know, if you're going to do all of that saving and work so hard and you still can't get the life that you have dreamt of and that your parents have dreamt of for you.

</details>

**主持人**: 我想谈谈就业市场也不同了，当我们看选项、替代方案时。我们认为年轻一代是否认为他们有更多的选择？我想，与你打个比方，就像打卡上班一样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: I want to talk about the job market is also different in that when we look at the options, the alternatives. Do we think that the younger generation perceive that they have more options available? I'm thinking, in comparison to you put that analogy of kind of putting in your punch card.

</details>

**Tricia Williams**: 嗯，现在的替代方案可能对很多人来说是**内容创作**或成为**网红**。有这些选择，比如，“好吧，如果这个行不通，我可能可以做这个。”或者如果我把它作为一个副业来做，你知道吗？我看到了一些劳动的成果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: Yeah. Well, the alternative now might be for a lot of people, content creating or being an influencer. There are these options like, well, if this doesn't work out we can I can possibly do this. Or if I was doing this as a side hustle, you know what? I am seeing some of my fruits of my labour.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。你知道，这很有趣，因为，你知道，我永远不想成为一个内容创作者。我几乎无法发帖给我的家人和朋友，但很多人确实渴望这样做。而且我认为，你知道，同样的方式。就像30年前很难想象你可以拥有一个完全在线的业务一样，对吧？所以，任何技术或，你知道，发展时代都会创造新的工作岗位，就像有些工作消失一样，对吧？我们现在的行政助理可以使用**AI工具**，他们的角色正在改变。所以当我们说，年轻人想成为内容创作者有问题吗？不。我认为，你知道，这是我们生活在其中的新经济。我们认为现在那里有价值吗？它作为一个可行的生活方式，可行的职业——我应该说不是生活方式。它在加拿大对年轻人来说是一份可行的生计吗？嗯，我想说这比其他地方要少一些。所以你可能会看到美国的年轻人拥有一个截然不同的变现结构。在这里，你无法通过观看次数和点击次数等方式赚取相同的金钱。所以它是一个较小的选择。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Yeah. You know, it's it's funny because, you know, I would never want to be a content creator. I can barely post to my family and friends, but a lot of people do aspire to this. And I think, you know, the same way. Like it was hard to imagine 30 years ago that you could have a fully online business. Right? So new jobs get created with any kind of technology or, you know, era of development the same way some disappear, right? We might administrative assistants now can use AI tools and their role is changing. So when we say like is it a problem if young people want to be content creators? No. I think, you know, this is the new economy we live in. Do we think there's value there now? The extent to which it's a viable lifestyle, viable career, I should say not lifestyle. Is it a viable livelihood for young people in Canada? Well, I'd say that's a little bit less than other places. So you might be looking at young people in the US that have a much different monetization structure. Right here. You can't earn money the same way from views and clicks and so forth. So it is less of an option.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。我想把话题拉回到调查。调查发现，Z世代比追求公司阶梯更关注**工作与生活的平衡**。公司如何扭转这种态度？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: All right. I want to bring back the survey. The survey found that Gen Z's are more focused on work life balance than climbing that corporate ladder. How can companies turn that attitude around?

</details>

**Tricia Williams**: 嗯，你知道吗？我们对工作质量进行了研究。我们发现人们一致明确表示，他们希望有机会学习和成长。对。这对加拿大来说太棒了。我们需要人们不断学习，不仅仅是在职业生涯早期，而是在整个职业生涯中，因为，你知道，技术变化如此之快，以及我们所需的技能。所以当我们问，年轻人想进入领导层吗？我想说他们可能会，但在**正确的条件下**。那么条件是什么呢？也许你想确保你的**中层管理者**没有精疲力竭，没有过度劳累。也许他们需要更多的支持。这众所周知是中层管理者挣扎的事情，对吧？我本人曾是一名中层管理者，我知道这是真的。你在中间受到挤压。所以，我认为，你知道，年轻人说我们不一定想要前几代人接受的那种交易。我认为最重要的是，这对我们所有人来说都是一个调整的挑战。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: Well, you know what? We did research on the quality of work. We really found that people were unanimously clear and that they want opportunities to learn and grow. Right. And this is great. We need that as Canada. We need people to be continually learning, not just early in their career, but throughout their careers, because, you know, technology is changing so fast and the skills we need. So when we say, do young people want to go into leadership? I'd say they might, but under the right conditions. So what are the conditions? Maybe you want to make sure your middle managers aren't burned out and aren't so overworked. Maybe they need to be supported more. This is famously something that middle management struggles with, right? And having been a middle manager myself, I know it's true. You get your squeezed in the middle. So I think, you know, young people are saying we don't necessarily want the deal that previous generations have accepted. And I think more than anything, that's a challenge to all of us to adjust.

</details>

**主持人**: 在**《麦克林氏》（Maclean's）**最近的一篇文章中，你写道，在经济衰退期间成年，会长期阻碍一个人的成长，即使在经济稳定之后也是如此。这对刚起步的人意味着什么？而且这不一定仅仅是经济衰退。如果我们看看我们现在所处的位置，我是说，我们已经脱离**新冠**几年了，但**新冠**对此有很大影响。**气候**是一个大问题。很多人对此非常恐惧。当你把所有这些年轻人都面临的事情打包在一起时，他们该如何开始呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: In a recent Maclean's article, you wrote, coming of age during an economic downturn can hinder a person's growth from a long time, even after the economy has stabilized. What does that mean for people starting out? And it's not necessarily just an economic downturn. If we look at where we are right now, I mean, we are a few years removed from Covid, but Covid had a lot to do with it. Climate is a big thing. A lot of people are very scared of that. When you package all of the things that are facing young people, how do how do you even start out?

</details>

**Tricia Williams**: 嗯，我们做了一些研究，研究了我们称之为**长期劳动力市场“疤痕效应”**。它实际上是基于20世纪90年代初的数据，当时我还是一名年轻人，在90年代初，那些毕业时遇到经济衰退的人，实际上可以从经验上将更高的青年失业率与更低的工资水平联系起来，甚至长达十年后。所以我们说，当你们毕业时，经济状况对你们的长期收入产生了长远影响，他们花了十年时间才从中恢复。所以我认为这会带来什么呢？嗯，首先，我这么说不是为了劝阻任何年轻人，或者他们担心他们的父母或家人。但我确实认为这表明需要一些**社会政策干预**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: Well, we did some research that looked at the long term labour market scarring effect that we called. And it really it's built on data from the early '90s, when I was a young person in the early '90s and people who graduated into a recession, you can actually empirically link a higher level of unemployment for youth with a lower wage level, even up to ten years later. So we're saying that there was a long impact of that when you graduated and the economic conditions in your longer term earnings, it took them ten years to recover from that. So what I think that does is, well, for one, I don't say that to discourage any young person now or their parents or family members who are concerned about them. But I do think it points to the need for some social policy interventions.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。那我们来谈谈，你谈到了工作场所能做什么，但政府也能做什么。他们又能做什么呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Okay. Well let's talk well, let's talk about you've talked about this, what workplaces can do, but also governments. What can they do as well.

</details>

**Tricia Williams**: 是的。我是说，这就是我们，你知道，我们正在进行**代际投资**，用政府的话来说，以及我们国家的**基础设施**，同样的方式。我认为我们需要考虑在**社会基础设施**方面进行**代际投资**。所以年轻人绝对至关重要。他们是我们未来的医生、律师、护士，以及照顾我年老时的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: Yeah. And I mean this is where you know, we're in a in we're making generational investments, to use the government's words and the infrastructure of our country the same way. I think we need to be thinking about generational investments in the social infrastructure. So young people are absolutely critical. They are our future doctors and lawyers and nurses and and the people who are going to be taking care of me when I'm old and.

</details>

**主持人**: 格雷，你和我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Grey, you and I.

</details>

**Tricia Williams**: 我们俩。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: Both of us.

</details>

**Tricia Williams**: 所以我们需要确保我们促进他们的**教育**，对吧？他们向**劳动力市场**的过渡，并确保所有这些事情比现在发生得更顺利一些。这包括，你知道，确保他们获得**良好的指导和信息**，以帮助他们在**高等教育和中学教育**的关键阶段做出选择，关于是否以及如何进入高等教育，以确保有各种各样的**发展路径**可供选择，无论是**技术熟练的行业**，无论是**大学**，还是其他某种项目，并确保他们获得适当的**学费支持、经济援助**等等。这对年轻人来说是好事。但对我们来说，进行这些投资，确保我们拥有未来所需的劳动力，这一点非常重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: So we need to make sure that we are facilitating their education, right? Their transitions to the labour market, and to make sure all of those things happen a little more smoothly than they do right now. So that involves, you know, making sure they have really good guidance and information to help make choices at that critical stage in post-secondary and secondary school about whether and how to go forward in post-secondary to make sure there's a variety of pathways available, whether it's the skilled trades, whether it's university, whether it's some other sort of program, and to make sure that they have, you know, appropriate tuition support, financial aid, all of those things. That's good for young people. But it's really important for us to to make those investments, to make sure that we have the workforce we need in the future.

</details>

**主持人**: 你将它与**老年保障计划**进行了比较，以了解我们可以做什么，以及我们如何在这里进行创新。是的。那个计划，你从那个计划的益处中看到了什么，它如何能帮助年轻人？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: You make the sort of comparison to the old age security program to sort of what we can do is that when we're trying to think innovatively here. Yeah. How does that program, sort of what do you see from the benefits of that program to how it can help young people?

</details>

**Tricia Williams**: 嗯，我想想，你知道，**加拿大养老金计划**和**老年保障计划**制定的时候，它们是在上个世纪中叶制定的，那时**老年贫困**是一个真正的问题。我们仍然有贫困问题。对。但比如，仍然有很多退休人员面临着，你知道，他们退休计划的一个核心部分是确保他们不会被**OAS（老年保障金）**追回。对。如果我家人中有处于这种情况的人，而且，你知道，我认为我们作为一个国家，将我们资产的很大一部分投资于支持这个群体。对。我认为我们绝对需要确保它被用在需要的地方。但同时，我认为有一群人，我们没有从经济必然性的角度去考虑支持和投资他们。我们认为，“哦，年轻人，他们不够努力工作。他们只想玩电子游戏。”顺便说一句，电子游戏是非常好的训练。非常正确。非常正确。你知道，**手动灵活性**。所以，我认为我们需要创造性地思考我们投资于哪些方式、如何投资以及哪些群体，并将其视为一种道德必然。就像战后时期一样，你知道，**老年贫困**是我们非常关心的一个重大问题。我认为年轻人和他们的支持需要成为我们关注的关键问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: Well, if I think about when, you know, the Canada pension plan and the old age security programs were developed, they they came of age in the middle of the prior century when there was a real issue with senior poverty. And we still have issues with poverty. Right. But like, there's still a lot of retirees who face a, you know, a core plank of their retirement plan is making sure they don't get an OAS clawback. Right. And if people in my family who are in that situation and, you know, I think we we invest a significant portion of our assets as a country into supporting this group. Right. And I think we absolutely need to make sure it goes to where it's needed. But at the same time, I think there's a there's a group that we're not thinking of in terms of an economic imperative to support and invest in them. We think, oh, young people, they're not working hard enough. They just want to play video games. And by the way, video games is very good training. Very true. Very true. You know, the manual dexterity. So I do think we need to think creatively about the ways and how and which groups we invest in and see it as, as a moral imperative. And the same way in the post-war period, we, you know, senior poverty was a huge issue of concern for us. I think young people and their support needs to be a critical issue for us.

</details>

**主持人**: 我们谈到了**新冠**。我们谈到了，你知道，这个国家的**代际投资**。根据你的研究，**工作的未来**看起来是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: We talked about Covid. We talked about, you know, generational investments in this country. From your research, what does the future of work look like?

</details>

**Tricia Williams**: 我认为**工作的未来**将更加**人性化**。说实话。我认为很多时候我们关注的是技术方面，我认为我们将学会如何让计算机和机器在机器和计算机擅长的自动化事情上做得非常好。但我们工作的未来在于与人交谈。与他们互动。药剂师向病人解释用药。医生与某人谈论他们的**心理健康或治疗支持**。所以我认为工作的未来将更加人性化，并由工具、支持和自动化来增强。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: I think the future of work is more human. To be honest. I think a lot of times we focus on the technology aspect, and I think we're going to learn how to get computers and machines to be really good at the automated things that machines and computers are going to be really good at. But the future of our work is this it's talking to people. It's engaging with them. It's a pharmacist explaining the medication to a patient. It's a doctor talking to somebody about their mental health or therapy supports. And so I think the future of work is going to be much more human and augmented by tools and supports and automation.

</details>

**主持人**: 听起来所有世代的未来都是光明的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Host**: Sounds like the future is bright for all generations.

</details>

**Tricia Williams**: 我希望如此。我是说，我有一个九岁的女儿，我想，你知道，她的未来会是什么样子？她，你知道，而且我认为大多数年轻人，也许他们的工作还没有被创造出来。但我确实认为未来可以是光明的。但我也认为我们必须确保我们创造这些**发展路径**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tricia Williams**: I hope so, I mean, I have a nine year old daughter and I think, you know, what's her future going to look like? She, you know, and I think most young people, maybe their jobs haven't even been created yet. And but I do think the future can be bright. But I also think we have to make sure we create those pathways.

</details>

**主持人**: 我们就到这里吧。Tricia，我非常感谢你的时间。非常感谢你的见解。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
