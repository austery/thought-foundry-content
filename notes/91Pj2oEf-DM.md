### 播客开场与健身房牛奶现象

**Tracy:** 大家好，欢迎收听《Odd Lots》播客的又一期节目。我是Tracy Alloway。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to another episode of the OddLotss podcast. I'm Tracy Aloway</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 我是Joe Weisenthal。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I'm Joe Weisenthal.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** Joe，你是个健身爱好者，对吧？注意我没说“健身狂人”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Joe, you're a gym person, aren't you? Notice I did not say gym bro.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 是的，没错，谢谢。我确实有规律地去健身房，但还没到能看到明显效果的程度。我觉得我正处于人生的一个阶段，每天都在离死亡更近一点，所以我只是在“保持现状”，维持在同一水平。所以，我知道没有进步，但也许也没有退步。不过，是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, that's right. That's right. Thank you. Aspirationally, I do go to the gym regularly. I don't go to the gym regularly enough to see a difference. I think bec like I'm at the stage of life where like every day I'm getting a little bit closer to death and so I'm like holding serve. I'm like sort of holding at the same so like I know progress but maybe I'm not regressing. But yes,</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 我仍然觉得如果你经常去健身房，你就是个健身爱好者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I still think if you go to the gym regularly, you're a gym person.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 是的。好的，好吧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Okay. Yeah. All right.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 这很了不起。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's that's impressive.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 是的，我会对此少一些羞愧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I'm gonna have less shame about it.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 好的，这是我的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Here's my question. Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 你有没有注意到一些健身伙伴的饮水习惯？有没有人拿着牛奶瓶到处走？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Have you noticed the drinking habits of some of your fellow gym people? Have you noticed anyone walking around with bottles of milk?</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 我有。我的意思是，我仍然看到更多人拿着能量饮料而不是牛奶。但是的，我确实看到过。我想，以前，你知道，有些人，我觉得他们中一些人现在还在尝试每天喝一加仑牛奶。有一个著名的家伙，他写了一本书叫《Starting Strength》，他是杠铃界的一个“邪教”大师，我一时想不起他的名字了。我觉得他就是那种大力提倡喝大量牛奶的人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have. I mean, I still see more people with like the energy drinks rather than milk. But yeah, I've definitely seen, you know, I think like back in the day, you know, you had these guys. I think some of them still do with actual like people would try to drink a gallon of milk in a day. There's that famous um um guy, he has a book called Starting Strength. He's like a cult guru within the barbell world whose name I'm blanking on. I think he's a big like drink a bunch of milk</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 如果你认真对待，就得把生鸡蛋混到牛奶里喝。我是这么说的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you're serious about it, you got to mix raw eggs in with milk. That's what I say.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 你是吗？你做过吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You do? Have you done that?</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 不，我没有。不过，我在香港的时候脚踝三处骨折，当时医生确实建议我多喝牛奶来补充钙质，帮助脚踝愈合。总之，我们有点跑题了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, I haven't. Although I did when I I triple fractured my foot when I was in Hong Kong and I did have a doctor who advised me to drink a lot of milk to build up the calcium and heal the foot. Anyway, we're getting slightly off topic.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 好的。你在健身房经常看到的一个牛奶品牌叫做Fairlife。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. One of the milk brands that you see a lot in gyms is something called Fair Life.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 是的，我见过它，而且我以前从未真正想过它到底是什么，但是的，我确实见过这个品牌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, I've seen it and I actually literally like had never thought about what it is or but yes, I had seen this brand.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 好的。我对它了解不多，但我第一次对这家公司感兴趣是在读Austin Freric的《Barrens》一书时。书里有一整章是关于乳业巨头的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So, I don't know that much about it, but I first got kind of interested in the company reading Austin Freric's book Barrens. There's a whole chapter in there about dairy barons,</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 它讲的是Fair Oaks，后来变成了Fairlife。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and it's about fair oaks, which turned into Fair Life.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 我只知道可口可乐收购了Fairlife。他们与可口可乐达成了重要的分销协议，从我们之前关于Celsius等产品的讨论中，我们知道分销在饮料行业是多么重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">All I know about Fair Life is that Coke bought them. They had a big distribution deal with Coke and we know how important distribution is in the beverage industry from our previous conversations on Celsius and things like that.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 它已经变成了一种现象，Fairlife这种牛奶，我想它应该更健康，蛋白质含量更高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it's turned into this phenomenon where Fair Life is this milk that's I guess supposed to be healthier. It has more protein.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 它乳糖含量更少，或者没有乳糖，我记不清了。这意味着你可以在冰箱里保存它大约100天。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh it has less lactose or no lactose, I can't remember. Which means you can keep it in your fridge for like a 100 days,</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 这实际上我觉得很有用。所以我们应该谈谈它，因为它也引发了这场蛋白质热潮。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">which is actually I find that useful. So, we should talk about it because it's also kind of kicked off this whole protein craze.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 蛋白质。天哪。到处都是蛋白质。所以蛋白质，比如星巴克现在也有这些蛋白质饮料了。我还没尝过。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Protein. Oh my god. Protein everywhere. So, protein like uh yes, Starbucks, they have these. Now, you can get this protein drinks. I haven't tried them yet. I you know,</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 什么时候正常饮食变成了一种罪过？我吃肉，吃蔬菜，偶尔吃些碳水化合物之类的，等等。但是的，随着时间的推移，不同的宏量营养素会流行起来，对吧？所以有一段时间是关于“好脂肪”，对吧？人们对脂肪很着迷，然后又说，“哦，你需要发酵食品”，所以他们会说，多吃点那个，对肠道健康有益。但我们现在正处于一个蛋白质的牛市。人们真的想要更多的蛋白质，因为各种原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when did it become a crime to just eat normally? I got I eat some meat and I eat some veggies and occasionally eat some carbs and stuff like that and whatever. But yeah, you over time it's like different macronutrients trend, right? So there was a while it's like good fats, right? People were really into fats for a while and then it's like, oh, you need fermented stuff, so they have to, you know, let's eat more of that. It's good for your gut health. But we're in like a we're certainly in a protein bull market right now. People really want more protein because reasons.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 是的。Fairlife的有趣之处在于它赚了很多钱，这直接增加了可口可乐的利润。股价上涨了不少。而且这与乳制品行业正在发生的一切基本背道而驰，乳制品行业的价格往往很低，长期以来一直处于螺旋式下降的状态。利润率非常非常薄。所以这是一个例外。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And what's interesting again about Fair Life is it's making a lot of money. That's feeding into CO's bottom line. Share price has gone up quite a bit. And it's also at odds with basically everything else that's happening in the dairy industry where you know prices tend to be pretty low and have been kind of stuck in a downward spiral for a long time. Profit margins are very very thin. So this is an outlier.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 人们正在减少传统乳制品的消费。我想很多人，至少我不知道它有多大，但一些所谓的“替代牛奶”，比如杏仁奶、腰果奶、豆奶，可能正在抢占一些市场。是的。没有人再谈论二号牛奶了。我觉得现在每个人要么是脱脂牛奶，要么是全脂牛奶，因为社会两极分化越来越严重，没有人喜欢中间地带的牛奶了。所以现在他们显然也想要超高蛋白牛奶。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">People are consuming less traditional dairy. I think a lot you know at least I don't know how big is it it is but some of the quote alternative milks, the almond milks of the world, the cashew milks, soy milks probably taking some Yeah. plain old regular dairy. No one ever talks about, by the way, number two milk. I feel like everyone is either skim or fat these days because more of the sort of like polarization of society that no one likes a nice middle ground milk anymore. So now apparently they want super high protein milk, too.</p>
</details>

### Fairlife的创新：蛋白质与便携性

**Tracy:** 好的，我们请到了最合适的嘉宾来讨论Fairlife和整个乳制品行业。我们将与Corey Guyger对话。他是CoBank的首席乳业经济学家，CoBank是该行业非常重要的贷款机构。所以他真的是最适合交谈的人。Corey，非常感谢你来《Odd Lots》。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right, so we have the perfect guest to discuss Fair Life and the dairy industry in general. We're going to be speaking with Corey Guyger. He is the lead dairy economist with Coobank, which is a very big lender to the industry. So really the perfect person to speak to. Corey, thank you so much for coming on Odd Thoughts.</p>
</details>

**Corey:** 很高兴来到这里，Tracy和Joe。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I'm glad to be here, Tracy and Joe.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 那么我先问一个基本问题。Fairlife与传统牛奶有什么不同？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I'm going to start with a basic question. What differentiates Fair Life from traditional [clears throat] milk?</p>
</details>

**Corey:** 我认为这主要有两大方面：蛋白质和便携性。便携性体现在它是**超高温瞬时灭菌**（HTST: High Temperature Short Time Pasteurization: 一种快速加热和冷却牛奶的灭菌方法）并使用**无菌包装**（Aseptic Packaging: 无需冷藏即可运输和储存的包装方式）。这意味着它实际上可以在不冷藏的情况下运输。当你想到乳制品行业时，乳制品行业是世界上最大的冷藏食品链。你想想，一旦我们挤完奶并冷却牛奶，它就会在卡车上被冷却运到加工厂，然后传统乳制品会一直冷藏到杂货店或便利店。但Fairlife及其类似产品的故事是，当你使用无菌包装和超滤技术时，在打开瓶子之前，它的保质期会大大延长。当然，一旦打开，14天的保质期就开始倒计时了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think there's two big parts to this protein and portability. The portability is it's ultraasteurized and uses aseptic packaging. So that means it you can actually ship it without refrigeration. And when you think about the dairy industry, the dairy industry is the largest refrigerated food chain in the world really. You think as soon as we milk a cow and we cool the milk, it's cooled in the truck to the processing plant and then traditional dairy products are refrigerated all the way to the grocery store or convenience store. But the Fairlife story and products like it now are uh when you go to that aseptic packaging and ultra filtration until you open that bottle, it's got a lot longer shelf life. Of course, once it's opened, you're at a the 14-day clock starts ticking. this technology that allows you to store milk for a long time without refrigeration.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 这种允许牛奶在不冷藏的情况下长时间储存的技术，是早就被理解的，现在突然对这种牛奶有了需求，还是这项技术相对较新，然后行业才意识到“哦，因为这项技术，我们可以推广并让人们对利用这些能力的新产品感到兴奋”？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is this something that's been understood for a long time and now there's suddenly a demand for this milk or is the technology relatively recent and then the industry is like oh we can because of this technology we can market and get people excited about a new product that can take advantage of these capabilities.</p>
</details>

**Corey:** Fairlife首次出现在市场上是在2014年。所以它已经伴随我们大约十年了。但Fairlife团队真正需要完善的一件事是这种高温短时巴氏杀菌技术。所以你快速加热牛奶，然后快速冷却。我喜欢分享的一点是，牛奶是大自然最完美的饮料。你谈到它是一种健康饮料。如果它大自然最完美的饮料，那也意味着它是细菌滋生的绝佳场所。所以巴氏杀菌法，你知道，一百多年前，巴氏杀菌牛奶条例出台，它设定了一个国家标准，这样威斯康星州的农民就可以在芝加哥市场销售牛奶，或者纽约州北部的农民可以在纽约市销售牛奶，都遵循相同的规则和标准。但转向这种超高温短时巴氏杀菌技术，最初你会尝到一种烧焦的牛奶味。所以，如果你是消费者，尝到那种味道，你会觉得“嗯，不太对劲”。但现在，他们已经完善了那个过程，你真的能尝到你对乳制品牛奶所期望的味道。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, Fairlife first came on the scene in 2014. So, it's been with us about a decade. But one of the things that the team at Fairlife had to really perfect was this high temperature, shorttime pasteurization. So, you're heating the milk up quick and then cooling it quick. One of the things I like sharing is that milk is nature's most perfect beverage. You talked about it being a health beverage. If it's nature's most perfect beverage, that also means it's a great place to grow bacteria. So pasteurization, you know, over 100 years ago, the pasteurized milk ordinance came about and that set a national standard so that a Wisconsin farmer could sell milk in the Chicago market or a upstate New York farmer could sell milk into the in New York City under the same rules and standards. But going to this ultra the HTST, the high temperature shorttime pasteurization, originally you kind of got a burnt milk taste. So, if you're a consumer and you're tasting that, you're like, "Eh, it didn't hit the mark." But now, they pro perfected that process and you really get the flavor that you've come to expect from a dairy milk.</p>
</details>

### 可口可乐分销协议的重要性

**Tracy:** 你提到了必须向市场销售，我不太确定为什么，但我昨晚读了一本关于20世纪50年代小规模农业的书，它谈到如果你是一个小规模农民，想进入乳制品行业，你有一些选择。一个选择是卖给离你很近的当地市场，因为你知道牛奶不能冷藏太久，或者你卖给奶酪工厂之类的，这样你可以走得更远一点，也许可以批量销售更多。Fairlife与可口可乐的分销协议对其成功有多重要？这种饮料现在可以长距离、长时间运输，并且由可口可乐分销。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You mentioned having to um sell into markets, and I'm not quite sure why, but I was reading a book about small-scale farming from the 1950s last night, and it was talking about if you're a smallcale farmer and you want to get into dairy, you have some options. One option is you sell into a local market that's very close to you because you know you can't refrigerate the milk for that long or you sell to like a cheese factory or something like that and you can go a little bit further sell maybe more in bulk that sort of thing. How big a deal was fairife's distribution deal with Coke in its success? this idea that now you have a beverage that can be shipped over very very long distances, long timelines and you have Coke distributing it.</p>
</details>

**Corey:** 我认为这非常重要。如果你看看Fairlife概念的创始人，Mike和Sue McCloskey最初尝试的是一种他们最终命名为“运动员牛奶蜂蜜”的产品。所以他们当时正在寻找一种针对该市场消费者的健康饮料。创新是一回事，然后就是分销。对我来说，我是在威斯康星州一个六代奶农家庭长大的，牛奶一直以来的一个障碍就是便携性。你知道，你必须有一个复杂的运输系统来运输它。我这里说的是饮用牛奶。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think it was huge when you really look at it. I if you look at the founders of the concept of what became fair life originally they were experimenting Mike and Sumaclausi with a product that they eventually called athletes milk honey and so they were looking at finding a health beverage for consumers in that in that market. So there's one thing to be innovative, then it's distribution. And one of the for me, I'm a grew up on a sixth generation Wisconsin dairy farmer. One of the obstacles always for milk has been portability. You know, it's you have to have this elaborate transportation system to move it. And I'm talking beverage milk here.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Corey:** Fairlife通过**无菌包装**和高温巴氏杀菌技术克服了这一问题。这具有颠覆性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that really overcame the situation with what Fairlife has done with aseptic packaging and the HSUT process to high pasteurization. It was gamechanging.</p>
</details>

### 乳制品定价与行业历史

**Joe:** 我觉得这已经是旧闻了，但以前牛奶价格是根据你离威斯康星州奥克莱尔的距离来设定的，或者类似这样的情况，因为有一个前提是“哦，我们想要很远的牛奶”，然后你把它卖给当地市场，它被分销……解释一下这种做法是何时消失的，或者为什么威斯康星州奥克莱尔曾经是牛奶定价指数的中心枢纽，解释一下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think this is old news, but it used to be the case that milk prices, what's the deal? They were like set based on your distance from Oaklair, Wisconsin or something like that because there was this premise like oh we want milk very far away and you you sell it to your local market and it's distri explain that that went away or something but why was Oaklair Wisconsin this sort of central hub for a while of the index for pricing milk explain that</p>
</details>

**Corey:** 是的，这实际上有很多原因。我们先从一点乳制品历史说起。直到大约1910年，纽约是美国最大的牛奶生产州。然后威斯康星州取而代之，现在“美国乳制品之地”当然写在车牌上。威斯康星州实际上在19世纪末，一位后来成为州长的绅士William Dempster Horde，在19世纪70年代获得了第一辆冷藏铁路车，将威斯康星州的奶酪运到纽约市。今天，威斯康星州约90%的牛奶产量通过奶酪出口。这些出口可以是其他49个州，当然现在也销往世界各地。但由于威斯康星州和明尼苏达州生产了大量的奶酪，奥克莱尔曾是威斯康星州和明尼苏达州之间的一个中心点，用于建立牛奶的基准价格。这种做法在大约2000年左右消失了，我们现在有了一个不同的系统。但牛奶仍然受到**联邦牛奶营销指令**（Federal Milk Marketing Orders: 美国政府为稳定牛奶市场和价格而设立的法规体系）的高度监管，这才是真正决定牛奶价格的因素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yes there's a number of reasons for it actually we'll start with a little dairy history up until about 1910 New York [clears throat] New York was the largest milk producing state in the United States. Then that became Wisconsin and obviously now America's dairy land is on the license plates. Wisconsin actually in the 1800 late 1800s the gentleman who became governor of the state William Dempster Horde secured the first refrigerated rail car to ship Wisconsin cheese to New York City in the 1870s. And today, Wisconsin exports about 90% of their milk production via cheese. And that export could be the other 49 states and certainly now around the world. But because of all the cheese made in Wisconsin and Minnesota, Oaklair was that kind of center point between Wisconsin and Minnesota to establish a a base price for milk. That went away here in about 2000 and we have a different system. But milk is still highly regulated under federal milk marketing orders, which is really what establishes milk prices.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 那么，你能很快解释一下这些指令是什么，或者这意味着什么吗？比如，它受到监管，因为价格确实波动。所以它仍然受到高度监管是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, can you just real quickly explain what are these or like what does that mean? Like it's regulate because I the prices do fluctuate. So what does that mean that it's still highly regulated?</p>
</details>

**Corey:** 是的，高度监管意味着联邦牛奶营销指令将牛奶分为四类。第一类是饮用牛奶，也就是你喝的传统牛奶。当你回到Fairlife的故事时，你讨论了液态奶的销量一直持平，但像Fairlife和Core Power这样的产品实际上是液态奶和第二类产品的混合物，第二类产品传统上是可舀取的，比如酸奶、冰淇淋、酸奶油等。然后第三类，我喜欢分享“小塔菲特小姐坐在她的软垫上，吃着她的凝乳和乳清”。所以第三类是奶酪、凝乳和乳清。然后第四类产品是黄油和奶粉。奶粉就是脱脂奶粉。但这些类别都有不同的定价机制。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, highly regulated means that federal milk marketing orders there's four classes of milk. Class one would be beverage milk. That would be the traditional milk that you drink. And when you come back to the fair life story and you uh discussed that milk fluid milk sales have been flat but products like fair life and core power and those are actually a mixture of fluid milk and class two products which traditionally have been scoopable products like yogurt ice cream would be in there. Sour cream would be in there and then class three I liked sharing little Miss Tuffet sat on her muffet eating her curds and waist. So class 3 is cheese, curds and whey. And then class 4 products are butter and powder. And powder would be non-fat dry milk. But each of these classes has different pricing mechanisms.</p>
</details>

**Corey:** 今天，饮用牛奶的价格是根据第三类或第四类中较高的价格来定的。这很复杂，这也是为什么我称乳制品行业受到高度监管的原因。但这些指令是在1937年通过国会法案出台的，旨在确保牛奶的有序销售，并确保在奶牛数量不多的市场也能有液态奶供应。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And today beverage milk is priced on the higher of class 3 or class 4. It gets complicated and that's why I call dairy very regulated. But these orders came about in 1937. It was an act of Congress and it was to ensure the orderly marketing of milk and ensure fluid milk in markets that didn't have a lot of dairy cows.</p>
</details>

### 奶牛场的商业模式与技术创新

**Tracy:** 所以我从那本旧农耕书中了解到的一件事是，如果你是小规模农场，有很多可以利用的杠杆来提高利润。所以也许你从牛奶本身赚不到那么多钱，但你可以卖小牛犊来做小牛肉，或者一旦奶牛的产奶量下降，你就可以卖掉它们，或者你可以卖粪便做肥料等等。所有这些不同的杠杆。你能多谈谈奶牛场的实际商业模式以及现在钱是从哪里来的吗？因为我想它已经改变了很多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So [clears throat] one thing I learned from reading my old farming book is that there are a lot of levers that you can pull if you're again this is for smallcale farming but there are levers you can pull to boost profit. So maybe you're not going to make that much from milk itself, but you know, you can sell the calves for ve or once the uh dairy production starts going down with your cows, you can sell those or you can sell manure for fertilizer and things like that. All these different levers. Can you talk a little bit more about the actual business model of a dairy farm and where money comes from nowadays? Because I imagine it's changed quite a bit.</p>
</details>

**Corey:** 这是一个充满活力的领域。我们稍后会谈到奶牛场，但目前美国乳制品行业有110亿美元的新工厂投资，涉及多个类别。所以有很多活力和大量的投资。这是历史性的投资。当你谈到奶牛场时，显然如果你在挤奶，你的第一收入来源是牛奶。我想说，直到五年前，你90%的收入都来自牛奶，除非你销售大量农作物。但一个动态的变化，也是现在新闻中经常出现的，是牛肉价格。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is a dynamic space and from an over we'll talk about the dairy farm in a second but dairy right now has 11 billion dollar of new plant investment in the United States and it's in a number of categories. So there's a lot of energy taking place and a lot of investment. This is historic investment. When you get to the dairy farm obviously if you're a milking cows your number one revenue source is milk. I would say up until 5 years ago, 90% of your income came from milk unless you were selling a lot of crops. But one of the dynamic things that have changed and it's in the news a lot right now is beef prices.</p>

**Corey:** 每头奶牛都有作为肉牛的第二职业。大约五年前，我曾认为奶牛是地球上研究最多的动物。我们对它了解更多。在过去一百年里，我们有超过1.23亿条关于它的记录。2008年，**基因组学**（Genomics: 研究生物体全部基因的科学）科学进入了这个行业。我实际上是第一个撰写公开文章的人。但你所做的是从奶牛身上提取DNA样本。你运行它的基因档案，并可以将其与所有这些表型数据（1.23亿条记录）进行比较。我们可以以大约70%的准确率预测那头小牛犊长大后会怎样。这改变了乳制品行业的许多事情。我们正在以前所未有的速度提高乳脂和蛋白质水平。如今，四分之一的母牛犊，即最终会成为奶牛的小牛犊，都进行了基因组测试。这确实改变了局面。然后，随着这一切的发生，**性别分选精液**（Gender Sorted Semen: 通过技术分离精子以控制后代性别的技术）进入了行业，所以我们可以使用激光。他们可以分选出产生公牛犊的Y染色体，并以大约90%到95%的准确率生产出能产生奶牛犊的产品。所以奶农们正在规划他们的替代品。他们正在利用科学来预测哪些是最好的。这打开了一扇全新的大门。

<p class="english-text">And every cow has a second career as a beef animal. About five years ago, well, I considered the dairy cow the most researched animal on planet Earth. We know more about her. We have over 123 million records on her over the last hundred years. In 2008, the science of genomics came into the industry. I was actually the first one to write a public article about it. But what you do is you take a a DNA sample from the cow. You run her profile and you can compare it to all this phenotypic data that 123 million records. And with about 70% accuracy, we can predict what that baby calf will do as a cow. And that has changed a lot of things in dairy. We are uh improving butter fat and protein levels at paces we've never seen before. And these days, one out of four heer calavs, baby calves that will eventually become cows have a genomic test run on them. And that has really changed things. Then as that took place, gender sorted semen came into the industry so we can uh they use lasers. They can sort out the Y chromosomes which make a bull calf and with about 90 to 95% accuracy produce a product that makes dairy heer calves. So dairy farmers were planning their replacements. They're using science to predict the ones. And that opened a whole new door</p>
</details>

**Corey:** 我们可以利用我们称之为肉牛品种的牛。想想安格斯牛、利穆赞牛、夏洛莱牛，我们会繁殖它们。我们会使用人工授精，这是农业中最初的AI，而不是人工智能，来给奶牛授精。如今，奶农们通过这种方式赚了更多的钱。所以大约五年前，回到Tracy最初的问题，奶农通过牛肉销售，每百磅牛奶当量大约赚1美元。假设奶农每百磅牛奶赚18到20美元。所以1美元不算什么大数目。但今天这个数字已经涨到了4450美元。所以我们正在培育一头小黑头牛犊，一头安格斯牛犊，它最终会进入饲养场，现在售价在1200到1800美元之间。哇。

<p class="english-text">to use what we call beef breeds. Think Angus, Limousine, Charlay that we would breed those. We'd use artificial insemination, the original AI in agriculture, not [laughter] artificial intelligence, to uh inseminate the cows. And dairy farmers are making more money on that these days. So about five years ago, back to Tracy's original question, a dairy farmer was making about $1 per hundred weight, per 100 pounds of milk equivalent from beef sales. and say a dairy farmer is making 18 to 20. So it wasn't $18 to $20 per hundred weight for milk. It wasn't a big deal. But today that number has gone to 4450. So we're get generating a baby black heighted calf, an Angus calf that's destined for a feed lot eventually is selling between 12 and $1,800 right now. Wow.</p>

**Joe:** 所以这是一个巨大的收入来源。

### 提高产奶量与奶牛健康

**Joe:** 那么当你谈到提高乳脂等等的时候，这是否意味着通过选择性育种，你更有可能得到一头具有你所寻找的高水平特质的小牛？这到底是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So when you're talking about improving uh sort of butter fat and so forth, what is going is it selective breeding that just means that you're more likely to get a baby cow that has high levels of whatever you're looking for? Like what is</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 还有更好的生产率？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and better production rate?</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 是的，更高产量的来源是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. what is the source of I guess higher yields?</p>
</details>

**Corey:** 我是美国荷斯坦协会的前任主席，这是世界上最大的奶牛品种组织，这个来源是一系列指标。我们研究很多性状。当然，最重要的两个是乳脂。嗯，最重要的三个是乳脂、蛋白质和牛奶产量。但我们也在关注乳腺炎抵抗力，也就是对抗乳房感染的能力。我们正在寻找长寿性，我们称之为生产寿命，甚至是后代妊娠率，这是一个生育指标。所以它是一系列更好的奶牛产量和从医疗保健等方面降低成本的组合。现在，如果你使用最好的荷斯坦公牛群，甚至是泽西公牛群进行下一代繁殖，我们每年可以改善遗传基因100美元。在基因组学之前，这个数字大约是13美元。所以这是一个显著的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I'm past president of holing association USA which is the largest dairy breed organization in the world and that source is a bundle of metrics. We study a lot of traits. Uh certainly the big two would be butter fat. Well, big three would be butter fat, protein and milk. But we are also looking at mastitis resistance or that you know the ability to combat an infection in the udder. We're looking for longevity which is a trait we call productive life or even daughter pregnancy rate which is a fertility metric. So it's this bundle of better yields from the cow and reduce costs from uh the standpoint of health care and those kind of things. And right now uh if you use the best group of holing bulls or even jersey bulls on the next generation each year we're improving genetics $100 per year. Prior to genomics that number was like $13. So this is like significant</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 哇。

### 奶牛场的成本与食物回收

**Joe:** 好的。你谈到了奶牛场可以产生的收入。那么实际的投入价格怎么样？因为，再次从这本书中读到，需要大量的饲料、大量的干草、大量的谷物才能让这些奶牛产奶，并且如果要把它们卖作牛肉，还需要让它们达到一定体型。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. What about, you know, you're talking about income that dairy farms can generate. What's going on with the actual input prices? Because it takes a lot of, again, from reading this book, takes a lot of feed, a lot of hay, a lot of grains to actually get these cows producing milk and also up to size if you're going to sell them for beef.</p>
</details>

**Corey:** 奶牛场最大的成本是饲料和劳动力。我妻子的家人实际上是美国第一批在25年前使用机器人挤奶的。所以一些农民正在使用机器人技术，但目前这还不是主流。但看看饲料的近期价格。大豆、玉米谷物以及苜蓿是一些核心成分。这些价格都在下降。现在，如果你是畜牧生产者，这是好事。如果你是农作物种植者，那就不是什么好事了。现在另一个情况是，美国37%的玉米作物实际上用于生物燃料，即乙醇。所以那里有副产品饲料，在大豆领域也是如此，我们正在生产生物柴油，其中一个副产品是大豆粕。所以奶牛是一个很好的回收者。事实上，奶牛的四个胃使它能够吃很多副产品饲料。我曾走遍了48个州，报道乳制品行业。你知道，我见过加利福尼亚州那些不符合人类食品标准的番茄和胡萝卜被喂给奶牛。我在俄亥俄州见过Smuckers公司废弃的果冻被喂给奶牛。我还在加拿大见过一位农民，他把隔壁为麦当劳烘焙饼干的工厂车道上的废弃饼干铲出来，这些废弃饼干被放入**全混合日粮**（Total Mixed Ration, TMR: 一种将所有饲料成分混合在一起的奶牛日粮），所以它就像一个大型食物搅拌机。把所有食物混合在一起，奶牛就能吃到混合日粮。所以这是一个相当了不起的故事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, the biggest costs on a dairy farm are feed and labor. My wife's family was actually the first to put robots in 25 years ago in the United States to start milking their cows. So, some farmers are using robot technology, but that's not exactly mainstream at this point. But look at the near-term prices for feed. Soybean and corn grain certainly in alalfa are some of the core constituents. Those prices are down. Now, that's a good thing if you're a livestock producer. Not a great thing if you're a row crop farmer. The other thing these days, 37% of the US corn crop actually goes to bofuels, ethanol. So, there's byproduct feeds there and as well as in the soybean space, we're making biodiesel and one of the byproducts of that is soybean meal. So, the cow is a great recycler. In fact, that four stomachs of the cow allow her to eat a lot of byproduct feeds. And it I've traveled I think I've been to 48 states covering the dairy industry. You know, I've seen tomatoes and carrots that didn't make human grade food in California get fed to cows. I've been in Ohio where reject jelly from Smuckers has been fed to cows. I've been to Canada where a farmer plows out the driveway next door of the plant that bakes biscuits for McDonald's and the reject biscuits go into what is a total mixed ration, a TMR. So, it's a big food blender. Mixes up all the food and the cows uh get a blended diet. So, it's kind of a remarkable story.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 老实说，吃麦当劳饼干的奶牛听起来很不错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Honestly, a cow fed on McDonald's biscuit. Sounds pretty good.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 听起来很棒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sounds great.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 听起来奶牛就是一台神奇的机器。所有这些被丢弃的食物产品，人们没有其他用途的，因为我们大多数人没有四个胃，然后每年奶牛的生产效率都会提高，或者你更善于生产高产奶牛。听起来是个很棒的生意。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It sounds like a cow is just an amazing machine. All of these discarded food products go in that people that there no other use for because most of us don't have four stomachs and then every year the cows get better at production or you get better at producing higher producing cows. Sounds like a great business.</p>
</details>

**Corey:** 这确实很了不起，尽管牛奶是一种非常稳定的产品，但每个农场和他们处理它的方式都不同。你知道，它们之间有很多相似之处，但也有很多地区差异。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is remarkable and uh that's why even though uh milk is a product that is very consistent, every farm is different and how every they approach it. You know, there's very there's similarities to it, but there's a lot of regional differences as well.</p>
</details>

### 乳制品消费趋势与行业整合

**Tracy:** 等等。好的。所以奶牛可能是神奇的机器。神奇的机器。谢谢。我至少要说一个双关语。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Wait. Okay. So, cows might be amazing machines. Amazing machines. Machines. Thank you. I had to get at least one pun in there.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 但我们听说乳制品行业一直面临挑战，对吧？所以消费量一直在下降。我想我读到过，自1975年以来，美国下降了40%，大概是这样。利润率仍然相当受压。价格似乎基本上是在竞相触底，所以你看到很多小农场整合成了这些大型乳制品企业集团。情况是这样吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the dairy industry we hear has been challenged, right? So, consumption has been going down. I think I read somewhere it's down 40% in the US since 1975, something like that. profit margins are still pretty compressed. Prices seem to be on basically it's a race to the bottom and so you've kind of seen a lot of consolidation of the smaller farms into these big dairy conglomerates. Is that the story there?</p>
</details>

**Corey:** 嗯，我想先纠正一下。乳制品消费实际上达到了40年来的最高水平，我们对此有非常好的美国农业部（USDA）数据来衡量。但如果你看近期，我们一开始谈论Fairlife。那是可口可乐最新的10亿美元品牌。如果你看酸奶的同比销量，它增长了近10%。酸奶类别中的一个大故事当然是Shabbani。现在酸奶销量的一半是希腊酸奶，它们是高蛋白酸奶。另一个正在爆炸式增长的类别是，我们让奶奶的**农家奶酪**（Cottage Cheese: 一种由凝乳制成的软质、未成熟的奶酪）再次流行起来。农家奶酪的销量正在上升，农家奶酪很棒。我觉得它总应该像希腊酸奶一样有一个高光时刻。就像，“哦，今年是农家奶酪年。”它终于要来了吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I want to back up first though. Dairy consumption is actually at the highest level it's been in 40 years and we measure that. We have some really good USDA data on that. But if you look at near-term, you know, we started out talking about fair life. That's uh Coca-Cola's newest $1 billion brand. If you look at yogurt year-over-year, it's up almost 10%. One of the big stories in the yogurt category is u certainly Shabbani. And I would h half of the sales of yogurt these days are Greek yogurt, which are high protein yogurt. Another category that's been exploding, it's we made grandma's cottage cheese hip again. And cottage cheese is up for cottage cheese is great. thought it it always feels like it should have a moment more like Greek yogurt. It's like, "Oh, this is cottage cheese year." Is it finally happening?</p>
</details>

**Corey:** 是的，它正在发生。人们生产的速度不够快。我上周在威斯康星州奶酪制造商会议上，实际上正在和一位乳制品加工商谈论酸奶。他的一位客户说：“你能给我更多吗？”他说：“嗯，要等到明年。”客户又说：“那就给我你能给的任何数量吧。这些产品现在非常紧俏。”然后奶酪消费量实际上达到了历史最高水平，人均每年40磅。所以这些都是重要的增长领域。Tracy你可能看到的是液态奶的故事。在20世纪70年代，普通美国人每年喝30加仑牛奶，现在可能接近19加仑。液态奶的一个问题是它与干早餐麦片是互补的，事实上，所有液态奶的三分之一是与干早餐麦片一起消费的，而这个类别表现不佳。但如果你转到Core Power这种高蛋白奶昔，它实际上没有被归入液态饮料类别。它被认为是不同的产品。我们确实看到了乳制品行业的整合。每年奶牛场数量都在减少。但有趣的是，我1995年大学毕业。虽然奶牛场数量下降了，但奶牛数量基本相同，大约930万头。但在此期间，这些奶牛的产奶量却增长了45%。这说明了奶牛的效率以及奶牛场正在发生的变化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It it is. And people can't make it fast enough. I was actually talking to a dairy processor at a Wisconsin cheese makers meeting just last week when it comes to yogurt. And one of his customers said, "Can you get me more?" And he goes, "Well, not until next year." And he goes, "Well, just send me whatever you can. It's those products are very tight right now." And then cheese consumption is at an all-time high actually at 40 pounds per person per year per capita. So those are some big growth areas. What you're probably seeing Tracy though is uh the story on fluid milk. In the 1970s the average American drank 30 gallons a year and now are probably closer to 19 gallons. One of the things for fluid milk is it's hitched to dry breakfast cereal compliments to one another and in fact onethird of all fluid milk it's consumed on dry breakfast cereal and that category has not been going well. But then you flip over to these the core power which is really a high protein milkshake and that is not actually tracked in the fluid beverage category. It's considered a different product. We have seen consolidation in the dairy industry. There's fewer dairy farms each year. But the interesting thing is I graduated college in 1995. While dairy farm numbers are down, the number of dairy cows are the same essentially about 9.3 million. But milk production from those cows is up 45% during that time. just speaks to the uh efficiency of the dairy cow and what things are taking place on the dairy farm.</p>
</details>

### 液态奶市场的两极分化

**Joe:** 我的直觉是正确的，在液态奶类别中，我们已经看到了社会上的一切都变得如此两极分化，每个人都喜欢极端，我们在政治中看到了这一点。我们在任何地方都看到了这一点。这是众所周知的，没有人再喜欢中间地带了。在液态奶类别中，每个人都走向了极端吗？他们想要高脂肪牛奶或脱脂牛奶，而放弃了那种很好的2%牛奶，即“缺失的中间地带”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My intuition is correct that within the liquid milks category, we've sort every everything in society has become so polarized and everyone loves extremes and we see it in politics. We see it in everywhere. This is well known people no one likes the middle ground anymore within the liquid milk category. Has everyone sort of has gone to the extreme ends? They want the highfat milk or the skim leaving that good old 2% milk, the missing middle.</p>
</details>

**Corey:** 这是一个非常有趣的问题，Joe。液态奶市场正在发生什么？有三大趋势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That that's a very interesting question, Joel. What's taking place in fluid milk? I three big trends.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 好的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay.</p>
</details>

**Corey:** 蛋白质。比如Fairlife这样的产品。另一个是无乳糖。现在新建的牛奶加工厂将配备**膜技术**（Membrane Technology: 利用选择性渗透膜分离混合物中不同组分的技术）进行**反渗透**（Reverse Osmosis: 一种利用半透膜分离溶液中溶剂分子的膜分离技术）。几乎所有新型牛奶都在去除乳糖。你必须记住，大约三分之一的美国人可能**乳糖不耐受**（Lactose Intolerant: 无法完全消化乳糖的生理状况），大约1.2亿人。所以让我们生产一种他们可以享受的产品。然后在传统牛奶类别中，你完全正确。全脂牛奶是目前唯一增长的。脱脂牛奶，基本上是无脂肪的，以及其他百分比的牛奶都在下降。你知道，美国农业部（USDA）和食品药品监督管理局（FDA）每五年发布的《美国人膳食指南》并没有真正改变他们对脂肪的指导。但有很多研究表明，乳制品和动物蛋白（如牛肉、猪肉、家禽、鱼类、海鲜）中发现的饱和脂肪实际上对你有益。因此，人们已经用他们的钱包在这个类别中投票了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Protein. So products like Fair Life. Another one is lactosefree. A new milk plant going up today will have membrane technology in to do reverse osmosis. And about everybody on the new milks are pulling out lactose. And you got to remember about onethird of Americans are probably lactose intolerant, about 120 million. So let's make a product that they uh can enjoy. And then in the traditional milk categories, you're absolutely right. Whole milk is about the only one that's growing right now. Skim, which is basically fat-ree, and the other percentages are down. You know, the dietary guidelines for Americans that USDA and FDA uh do every five years haven't really changed their guidance on fat. But there's a lot of research out there that said the fats uh saturated fats found in dairy and animal protein like beef and pork and poultry, fish too, seafood are actually good for you. And so there are people already voting with their pocketbooks this category.</p>
</details>

### 货架摆放与乳制品创新

**Joe:** 我们从之前关于当下流行饮料的节目中学到的一件事是，货架摆放位置在杂货店中的重要性。我不得不承认，当我在杂货店买牛奶时，我基本上只买与视线平齐的。不过我确实买全脂牛奶。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One thing we learned from previous episodes on, I guess, trendy drinks of the moment is the importance of shelf placement in grocery stores. And I have to admit, when I'm buying milk at a grocery store, I basically just buy what's at eye level. I do buy whole milk, though.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah,</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 那是偏好。但是对于牛奶这样的产品，货架摆放有多重要？牛奶通常被认为是必需品，可能不像其他一些东西那样有很强的品牌忠诚度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that's the preference. But how important is um placement for a product like milk which generally would be considered a staple and perhaps doesn't have as much brand loyalty as some other things.</p>
</details>

**Corey:** 是的，这有原因。在杂货店的过道里，如果你下次听完这个播客后去逛逛杂货店，乳制品通常在商店的后面，因为乳制品在超过95%的家庭中都有。所以它是一种日常购买的产品，这是摆放情况的一部分。大约五年前，很多植物性饮料正在取得进展，但现在它们的销量实际上在下降。我的直觉是，消费者正在寻找“干净的标签”，他们想看到他们能理解的成分。我认为这也是乳制品领域潮流变化的一部分。有趣的是，当你审视它并思考我们刚刚度过可口可乐与Select Milk和Fairlife合作十周年纪念日。现在有其他人正在关注这个领域。你知道，百事公司（PepsiCo）已经宣布他们的Propel水品牌将推出含有20克蛋白质的透明蛋白水，他们还在重新配制他们的Muscle Milk，并且在该类别中也将使用乳制品蛋白。我想当你去Costco或Walmart这样的地方时，乳制品不再仅仅出现在乳制品过道。它是货架稳定的。它可能在健康食品区。它可能在成人营养区等等。所以它正在超越其传统角色，因为这些高蛋白饮料。而且，如果你正在寻找钙，其中一些产品，你知道，一份就可以为你提供50%的钙。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it well there's a reason in the grocery aisle if you look at if you walk through your grocery aisle the next time after listening this podcast dairy is often in the back of the store because dairy is in like n over 95% of households. So, it's uh a routinely purchased product and that's part of the uh placement situation. Now, about 5 years ago, a lot of the p plant plant-based beverages were making inroads and those sales are actually down now. People consumers in my intuition are looking for clean labels and they want to see ingredients that they can understand. And I think that's been part of the changing tide in the dairy space as well. And it's interesting when you look at it and you think about we're just past the 10y year anniversary now of Coca-Cola and Select Milk and Fairlife partnership. Now there's others that are looking into that space. You know PepsiCo has announced that they're going to have a their Propel water brand is going to have a clear protein in it that has 20 grams of protein and they're also reformulating their muscle milk and they're going to have dairybased protein in that category as well. I think when you go to places like Costco or Walmart, the a dairy is just not found in the dairy aisle anymore. It's shelf stable. It could be in the health food section. It could be in, you know, adult nutrition sections and those kind of things. And so, it's expanding beyond its traditional role because of these high protein beverages. And also I you if you're looking for calcium, some of these products are, you know, in one serving can get you 50% of that as well.</p>
</details>

</details>

**Joe:** 显然，我们需要更多。但行业需要多长时间才能说，“你知道吗，这是一个持久的趋势。我们实际上要投资于这个加工领域”，因为肯定存在一些风险。消费者非常善变。互联网健康影响者，明年可能就会转向其他东西。我们会说，“哦不，你必须得到什么，你又回到低脂肪了。”那是新的热门等等。生产者如何考虑他们的资本配置预算，当涉及到在消费领域追逐新趋势时？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Apparently, we need more. But does the industry like how long does it take the industry to say, you know what, this is a durable trend. We're actually going to invest in the processing space for this because there's got to be some risk. Consumers are very fickle. Internet health influencers, they may be on to something else by next year. We're like, oh no, you got to get whatever you go back to low fat. That's the new hot thing, etc. How do producers think about their capital allocation budget when it comes to playing on new trends within consumption?</p>
</details>

**Corey:** 嗯，这是一个庞大而重要的问题，Joe。你真的要看长期趋势和事物的发展方向。Tracy完全正确。如果你读一些研究，纤维可能确实会是蛋白质之后的下一个热门。我听到人们谈论如何推出一款含有蛋白质和纤维的饮料，并将两者捆绑在一起。你知道，当我上小学的时候，在20世纪70年代中后期，有一种奶酪叫做马苏里拉奶酪，当时人均消费量只有几磅，现在它已成为美国消费量最大的奶酪，这主要归因于它与披萨的关系。所以这些大趋势可以重塑品类。你知道，在19……嗯，让我们再追溯得远一点。在20世纪60年代，有一个组织叫做威斯康星州育肥猪合作社，它怎么会在威斯康星州成立呢，当时爱荷华州是最大的生猪州。但当时发生的情况是，我们没有技术。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, that's a large and big question, Joe. And you really look at the long-term trends and where things are going. Tracy's absolutely right. If you read some of the research, fiber probably will be the next followup, the protein. I hear people talking about how do I put a protein drink out there with fiber in it and bundle the two together. You know, when I was uh going to grade school, there was a cheese out there called mozzarella in the late mid 1970s that was only at a couple pounds per capita consumption, and now it's the most consumed cheese in the US largely because of its relationship with pizza. So, these mega trends can reshape categories. You know, in the 19 Well, let's back up even a little further. There was a in the 1960s there was an organization called the Wisconsin Feeder Pig Cooperative and how in the heck would that be formed in Wisconsin when Iowa is the largest hog state but what was happening we didn't have the technology</p>

**Corey:** 回到凝乳和乳清制作奶酪。我们可以制作奶酪，但副产品是乳清，而乳清中含有蛋白质，这是人类已知最完整的氨基酸。但奶酪制造商只会说在农民家里，他们会用它做点什么。有些人会把它撒在田里。有些人会喂给小猪。我们发现小猪长得非常快。所以威斯康星州育肥猪合作社开始向爱荷华州运送200万到300万头育肥猪，用玉米和大豆完成育肥。现在我们可以使用这些大型干燥机，只需通过干燥就可以收获乳清。在很多奶酪工厂，不，不是很多，所有的新奶酪工厂都真正以一种商业模式进入，不仅是为了制作奶酪，更是为了捕获乳清。**乳清蛋白分离物**（Whey Protein Isolates: 从乳清中提取的高纯度蛋白质）现在每磅售价大约10美元，创历史新高。所以这些正在形成的商业模式以及为建设这些110亿美元新工厂所做的研究，实际上都是关于如何从牛奶中获取更多价值。我认为，你知道，**胶原蛋白**（Collagen: 动物体内一种重要的结构蛋白质），**初乳**（Colostrum: 哺乳动物分娩后最初几天分泌的乳汁），现在又有一个新的是**乳铁蛋白**（Lactoferrin: 一种存在于乳汁中的蛋白质，具有抗炎作用），它是牛奶中的一种成分，有助于减少炎症。有一些研究表明，你知道，根据你看到的数字，牛奶中可能有5000到6300种独特的分子。我们才刚刚开始研究这些，学习我们可以分离出哪些部分来帮助人类。未来几年，这个领域将会有越来越多的发现。而这都是投资策略的一部分，是工厂中将要发生的事情。我们离其中一些还有很多年。但是。

<p class="english-text">going back to Kurds and whey making cheese and whey we could make cheese but the byproduct was whey and in whey was protein the most complete amino acid known to humanity but cheese makers would just said in a farmer's home would it do something with it some would spread it on fields. Some would feed it to baby pigs. Well, we learned the baby pigs would grow so fast. So, the Wisconsin feeder pig co-op started shipping two to three million feeder pigs to Iowa to be finished with corn and soybeans. Well, now we can use these big dryers, just using drying and harvest that way. In a lot of cheese plants, not a lot, all the new cheese plants are really going in with a business model, not only to make cheese, but to capture the whey. Whey protein isolates are selling roughly at $10 a pound, which is record high. And so these business models that are taking place and the research to build these 11 billion in new plant investment is really how do we make more out of milk. I think you know collagens and colostrum and now a new one is lactopherin which is one of the milk components that really helps reduce inflammation. There's some research out there, you know, depending on the number you see, there may be 5,000, there may be 6,300 somewhere in there unique molecules in milk. And we are just beginning to research that, learning what parts we can pull apart and help humans. And there's going to be more and more in that space here in the coming years. And that's all part of that investment strategy, what's going to take place in the plant. We're years away from some of that. But</p>

### 奶农的抱怨与贸易问题

**Tracy:** 所以我了解农民的一点是，他们总是在抱怨。对此我没有评判。我也总是在抱怨。Joe可以证明这一点。但你现在从奶牛场那里听到最多的抱怨是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so one thing I know about farmers is they're always complaining about something. And no no judgment there. I'm always complaining about something too. Joe can attest to this. But what are the what are the current complaints that you're hearing the most from dairy farms?</p>
</details>

**Corey:** 嗯，目前美国90%的牛奶是按**多组分定价**（Multiple Component Pricing: 根据牛奶中脂肪和蛋白质等成分含量定价的方式）的。奶农会称之为MCP。其中90%的定价是基于乳脂和蛋白质。如果你把蛋白质和乳脂看作赛道上的两辆纳斯卡赛车，从2000年到2014年，蛋白质纳斯卡总是赢家。然后随着消费者开始需求更多的脂肪，记住风味就在脂肪里。乳脂在过去十年中赢了八年。但现在，我们生产了太多的乳脂，导致黄油价格不仅在美国，而且在全球范围内都在下降。所以这改变了牛奶的收入。所以如果你现在去参加一个乳制品会议，他们会说这就是过去60天牛奶价格下降的原因。这是一个近期最受关注的问题。另一个问题是劳动力。当然，经营一个奶牛场需要很多人，而美国乳制品行业和很多农民，美国人不喜欢做脏活累活。我周末会在我们家的农场工作。但这仍然像建造房屋一样，是一个非常需要亲自动手的过程。这将是另一个最受关注的问题。奶农们，你总能和他们聊聊天气。农民们普遍都受制于大自然。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, right now near-term 90% of milk in the United States is priced on multiple component pricing. Dairy farmers would say MCP. So and 90% of that pricing is butter, fat, and protein. Well, if you look at protein and butter fat as two NASCARs on the racetrack from 2000 to 2014, the protein NASCAR always won. And then as consumers started demanding more fat, and remember the flavor is in the fat. Butter fat won eight of the last 10 years. But right now, we've made so much butter fat that butter prices are down not only in the US, but worldwide. So that's changed the milk checks. So that would be if you went to a dairy meeting right now to be like that's what's sent milk prices down here in the last 60 days. That's one issue that is near and top of mind. The other thing would be uh labor. Of course it takes a lot of people to run a dairy farm and the US dairy industry and a lot of farmers. Americans don't like doing dirty jobs when it comes down to it. I on weekends I work on our family farm. But the these are still just like building homes. This is very hands-on process here. And that would be another issue that would be top of- mind. Dairy farmers and you'll always get a good conversation on the weather. Farmers in general are we always uh beholden to mother nature.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 有趣的是你没有提到贸易，但部分原因是我觉得总是有。

<details>

<p class="english-text">It's interesting you didn't say trade and but partly like I get the impression that there's always</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 威斯康星州的农民和边境另一边的朋友之间总是有无数的小诉讼，关于一些原产地规则，他们没有买足够的。这似乎是那种超越每一届政府的问题。他们试图解决，但总是在争论细节。你没有履行这个。你应该放行这么多加仑。谁没有。美国奶农认为与加拿大的乳制品贸易关系中，核心的持续存在的不公平或不理想的问题是什么？

<details>

<p class="english-text">a million little lawsuits going on between Wisconsin farmers and their friends on the other side of the border about some rules of origin and they're not buying enough at this. It seems like this is one of those things that transcends every administration. They try to hammer it out but they're always like sort of arguing over details. You're not fulfilling this. You're supposed to let in this many gallons. who didn't. What are the core persistent issues that American dairy farmers feel is unfair or unidal about I guess our dairy trading relationship with Canada?</p>
</details>

**Corey:** Joe，这是一个很好的观点，我应该把它列入我的清单。贸易是首要问题。1995年，美国在全球乳制品出口中基本上是无足轻重的。那一年北美自由贸易协定（NAFTA）生效。实际上NAFTA在1994年生效，1995年美国乳制品出口委员会成立，现在美国约17%的牛奶供应，或者说七分之一的牛奶罐车，实际上是以乳制品或配料的形式出口到世界各地。所以这对乳制品行业非常重要。我们实际上正在经历一个强劲的出口年，但这主要是因为美国乳制品和配料的价格低于其他两个主要竞争对手。所以欧盟，即27个欧盟国家，是世界上最大的乳制品出口国。他们大约出口20%的牛奶产量。然后是小而强大的新西兰，是世界第二大出口国。他们大约有500万头奶牛和500万人口，大致相当于明尼苏达州和威斯康星州的规模。所以他们三分之一的国内生产总值来自乳制品。如果你读奥克兰的报纸，你每周至少会听到一次乳制品相关的新闻。然后是美国。美国的第一大出口客户是我们在边境以南的朋友墨西哥。所以美国大约有90亿美元的乳制品出口市场。墨西哥占其中的大约20亿美元。现在，加拿大是一个单独的讨论。加拿大的牛奶供应主要由**配额系统**（Quota System: 一种限制生产或销售数量的市场管理制度）管理。所以那里的奶农购买销售牛奶的权利。事实上，在加拿大的奶牛场，配额的价值比其他一切都高。它比奶牛、土地和设备都更有价值。你不能让大量的进口产品进入。所以我们确实有一些产品运往北方，黄油就是其中之一。但当你现在听到头条新闻时，当然，上次贸易协定，即美墨加贸易协定中还达成了其他协议，其中一个主要围绕着蛋白质，这令人惊讶。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Joe, that's a great point and I should have put it in my list. Trade is top of mind. In 1995, the US was essentially a nonplayer in the global dairy exports. And that's the year that NAFTA came about. Actually NAFTA came about in 1994 and in 1995 the US dairy export council was formed and these days about 17% of the US milk supply or one out of seven tankers of milk are actually exported as either dairy products or ingredients around the world. So it's very important to dairy. We're actually having a strong export year, but largely because US dairy products and ingredients were lower than the other two major competitors. So the EU, the 27 countries of the European Union are the world's largest dairy exporters. They roughly export 20% of their milk production. Then the small and mighty nation of New Zealand is the number two exporter in the world. They have 5 million cows and 5 million people roughly in the size of Minnesota and Wisconsin. So onethird of their gross domestic product comes from dairy. If you read a Oakuckland paper, you would hear dairy at least weekly. And then comes the US. The US's number one e export customer is our friends south of the border in Mexico. So the US is about a $9 billion export market on dairy. Mexico is at about two billion of that. Now, Canada is a discussion to itself. Canada's milk supply is largely governed by a quota system. So, dairy farmers up there purchase the right to sell milk. And in fact, in on a Canadian dairy farm, the quota is worth more than everything else. It's worth more than the cows. It's worth more than the land. It's worth more than the equipment to make that work. You can't have a lot of imports come in. So, there are some things that we send north of the border. butter being one of them. But when you uh hear the headlines right now, of course, there are other things that were agreed upon in the trade agreement the last time, the US, Mexico, Canada trade agreement, and one of those largely centers on protein surprisingly.</p>

### 乳制品行业的未来展望

**Joe:** 这很有趣。那么，如果你展望未来十年乳制品行业的水晶球，对于奶牛场的成功或盈利能力来说，什么将是最重要的？是技术吗？是规模和整合吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">H that's interesting. So if you look into your crystal ball for the future in the next 10 years looking at the dairy industry, what's going to be most important in terms of the success of a dairy farm or profitability? Is it technology? Is it scale and consolidation?</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 也许是品牌和专业化，或者是你将牛奶分解成各种产品的效率，还是以上所有？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Is it perhaps branding and specialization or efficiencies in the way you're breaking down, you know, milk into all these various products or all of the above? Mhm.</p>
</details>

**Corey:** 我认为这是一个两部分的问题，因为你有奶农或乳制品生产者，然后你有乳制品加工商。我们必须在奶牛场使用越来越多的技术。我认为回到奶牛本身，当奶农投资于基因学时，这些基因学是累积的，它们非常重要，如果蛋白质热潮继续下去，基因学是唯一能改进它的方法之一。在这方面，我们的工具箱里没有太多饲养实践。当然，人工智能和技术，我这里指的是人工智能，对于正在听的农民来说将非常关键，我们必须使用更多的技术并寻找使用机器人技术的方法。我们已经在旋转式挤奶厅中做了一些。所以旋转式挤奶厅就像一个奶牛们上去的旋转木马。但当我们现在进行挤奶准备时，一些机器人会在我们挤奶之前涂抹乳头浸泡液或消毒剂，这很重要。所以这些是很多奶农也是农作物种植者的一些领域，特别是种植青贮玉米或苜蓿是两大主要作物，你知道，整个农机设备领域将是另一个方面。当谈到加工厂时，你知道，其中一些新的现代化加工厂有很多不锈钢设备，这些成本正在上升。但正是对技术的投资。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that's a two-part question because you got the dairy farmers or dairy producers and then you have the dairy processors. We're going to have to use more and more technology on the dairy farms. I think coming back to the cow, when dairy farmers invest in genetics, those genetics are additive and they're so important and if this protein booms continues, genetics is one of the only ways to improve it. We don't have a lot of feeding practices in the toolbox in that regard. Certainly AI and technology and I'm going to say artificial intelligence here for the farmers out there listening will be very crucial into this and we're going to have to use more technology and find ways to use robotic technology. We're already doing some of that in rotary milking parlor. So a rotary parlor would be like a merrygoround that the cows go on. But when we do milking preparation right now some robots are putting on te dip or a sanitizer before we milk that cow which is important. So those are some areas the space in a lot of dairy farmers are also crop farmers especially growing corn silage or alalfa would be two big staples and you know the whole space on farm equipment would be another area when it comes to the processing plants. You know, some of these new and modern processing plants have a lot of stainless steel and those costs are going up. But it's that investment in technology,</p>
</details>

**Corey:** 对它的投资。你知道，我们一直在谈论的这种超滤牛奶。你知道，我刚刚去了一个工厂。里面有将近9000个过滤器。这是一个非常干净和好的过程，但它需要大量的投资。

<details>

### 播客总结与个人反思

**Tracy:** 我真的从那次谈话中学到了很多。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I really did learn a lot from that conversation.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 不，那真的很有帮助。这是一个市场，像许多市场一样，我认为它显然有很强的市场成分，也有很强的监管成分。所以我觉得这些对我来说是最难理解的。例如，我没有意识到在加拿大，你需要购买销售乳制品的权利，所以这种销售市场的权利本身就变成了一种非常有价值的资产。我认为这是一次很棒的对话。我也对这样一个事实着迷，也许我们才刚刚开始了解牛奶中所有有用的分子，它们可以被分离出来并发挥作用。他提到了一些我从未听说过的，但这种想法是，还有更多的科学工作要做，以了解牛奶是什么，或者它里面有什么有价值的东西。那里有很多有趣的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, that was uh really helpful. This is one of those markets like many a markets I think where there's clearly a heavy market component and clearly a heavy regulatory component as well. And so I think those are some of the hardest for me to wrap my head around. I didn't realize, for example, that in Canada that you buy the right to sell dairy and so that just that right to sell into the market becomes a very valuable asset in its own right. I thought that was a great conversation. I'm also fascinated by the fact that maybe it's just day one in terms of learning about all of the useful molecules in milk that can be separated out and have some he mentioned a few that I had never heard of, but the idea that there's just more science there to be done on learning what is milk or what is in it that could be of value. A lot of interesting stuff there.</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 不，效率和你可以从单一产品——奶牛——中榨取出的价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No, the efficiencies and the values you can ring out of a single product, the cow,</p>

**Tracy:** 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 所以，是的。再次，我还是要回到那本书，只是因为它在我脑海中很新鲜，但它说的一件事是，如果你喂奶牛大量的玉米。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, yeah. Again, I'm gonna go back to that book just because it's fresh in my mind, but one of the things it was saying is if you feed the cows a bunch of corn,</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 它们会在粪便中排出玉米粒。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">then they spit out corn kernels in their manure.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 哦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh,</p>
</details>

**Tracy:** 而且你显然可以把这些半吃过的玉米粒喂给猪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and you can apparently actually feed pigs on the halfeaten corn kernels.</p>
</details>

**Joe:** 这真是令人作呕。

<details>

**Tracy:** 在粪便里。我知道。但它很高效，Joe。

</details>

**Joe:** 这很有趣。我想你管它叫什么来着？混合什么什么，你可以说，“哦，我们要把一些旧饼干和一些番茄放在一起”，没关系，奶牛的胃能够消化它。这真是一台令人难以置信的机器，它很好地提醒了我们大自然和生物学从效率角度来看是多么非凡。如果你想制造一台机器，能够分离出相当于四个不同胃的功能等等，那将是一台极其昂贵的机器。

<p class="english-text">It's interesting. I think what do you call it? mixed something something that you could just like, oh, we're going to have some old biscuits and we're going to put some tomatoes together and it doesn't matter the cow's stomach is going to be able to digest it. Like that is a really incredible machine and it is a good reminder of how extraordinary nature and biology are from efficiency standpoint that if you wanted to build a machine that could separate do the equivalent of you know four different stomachs etc. It would be such an extraordinarily costly machine</p>

**Joe:** 奶牛本身就很高效。我仍然对投入的劳动力感到惊讶。所以，你知道，产奶的奶牛必须产下小牛。所以你必须。

<details>
