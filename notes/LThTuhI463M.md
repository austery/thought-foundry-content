### FBI搜查投票记录

**Michael Baro**: 来自《纽约时报》，我是迈克尔·巴罗。这是《每日》播客。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Baro**: From the New York Times, I'm Michael Baro. This is the Daily.

</details>

**Michael Baro**: 今天，我们了解到FBI上周在佐治亚州对投票记录进行的极其不寻常的搜查，以及国家最高情报官员出现在现场的情况，还有那个令人震惊的电话，揭示了特朗普总统在调查中亲自介入的程度。我采访了我的同事德文·巴雷特。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Baro**: Today, what we're learning about the FBI's highly unusual seizure of voting records last week in Georgia, the presence of the nation's top intelligence official at the scene, and the stunning phone call that reveals how personally involved President Trump has become in the investigation. I spoke with my colleague, Develin Barrett.

</details>

**Michael Baro**: 这是2月3日，星期二。德文，这个故事始于几天前在佐治亚州富尔顿县发生的一场戏剧性场景。你能给我们描述一下吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Baro**: It's Tuesday, February 3rd. Devlin, this story begins with a dramatic scene which unfolded a few days ago in Fulton County, Georgia. Can you just describe that to us?

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 当然。请看亚特兰大附近富尔顿县选举办公室的实时画面。上周三早上，一群FBI特工出现，进行一项大规模的任务，收集与富尔顿县2020年选举相关的大量资料。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: Sure. So, take a live look at the Fulton County Elections Office near Atlanta. Last Wednesday morning, a group of FBI agents show up for a massive undertaking, the collection of a huge volume of stuff related to the 2020 election in Fulton County.

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: FBI特工们在富尔顿县佐治亚州选举委员会的记录仓库里度过了下午。富尔顿县包含亚特兰大市。所以，它显然有很多选举记录，但特工们此行的具体目的是获取该次选举的纸质选票，以及其他一些东西，比如选民名册、计票磁带，所有这些基本上都是关于2020年选举的数据和文件。所以，说清楚一点，6年前那次选举的每一张选票，或者接近全部的选票，都被FBI从这个大楼里带走了，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: FBI agents spent the afternoon inside the records warehouse for the Fulton County, Georgia Board of Elections. Fulton County contains the city of Atlanta. So obviously it has a lot of election records, but specifically what the agents were there to get were the paper ballots from that election, but also other things such as voter roles, such as tabulation tapes, all of which is essentially data and documentation about the 2020 election. So, just to be clear, every single ballot or close to it from an election 6 years ago is taken by the FBI out of this building,

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 对吧？把所有这些成百上千的箱子装上卡车并运往FBI的存储设施，需要花费数小时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: right? And it takes hours to load all those hundreds of boxes into trucks and bring them to an FBI storage facility.

</details>

**Michael Baro**: 那么，这次搜查的确切理由是什么？我想现在大多数人都明白特朗普总统对富尔顿县及其在2020年他输掉连任的毫无根据的选举舞弊指控中的反复出现，有着一种执念。但关于舞弊的那些指控，我们在这个节目中已经多次报道过在富尔顿县的情况。它们已经被如此彻底地审理和重审，以至于很难理解为什么还会进行新的调查。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Baro**: And what exactly is the rationale for this search? I think by now most people understand President Trump has a fixation on Fulton County and its recurring place in his baseless claims of election fraud in 2020 when he lost re-election. But those claims of fraud, we've covered them many times on this show in Fulton County. They have been so thoroughly litigated and relitigated that it would be hard to understand why a new investigation into them would ever be undertaken.

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 对吧？这些事情以前已经被调查过了。这些选票已经被计算了多次，以确保他们得到了正确的计数。而且结果总是被核实。所以当你看到这样的调查，看到这样的FBI搜查令时，就会引发一个显而易见的问题：为什么现在？有什么变化？我们有什么新的或不同的信息来证明这次搜查的合理性？现实是，作为搜查令基础的宣誓书，我们看不到。它仍然被密封着。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: Right? This stuff has been investigated before. These ballots have been counted multiple times to make sure they got the count right. And it's always checked out. And so when you see an investigation like this, when you see an FBI search warrant like this, it raises the obvious question, well, why now? What has changed? What new or different information do we have to justify this search? And the reality is the affidavit that is the underlying rationale for the search warrant, we can't see. that's still sealed.

</details>

**Michael Baro**: 所以，我们不知道确切的证据论证是什么来证明这次搜查的合理性，但我们知道理论上的论点是什么，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Baro**: So, we don't know exactly what evidentiary argument was made to justify this, but we know what the theoretical argument is, right?

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 就是不可能输掉佐治亚州。这是不可能的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: It's just not possible to have lost Georgia. It's not possible.

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 特朗普已经说了六年多了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: Trump's been making it more or less for 6 years.

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 在佐治亚州，州务卿在选举日几周前就开始非法处理选票。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: In Georgia, the Secretary of State began illegally processing ballots weeks before election day.

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 那不知怎么的，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: That somehow someway,

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 数千张伪造的乔·拜登选票。这些选票，这些证据显示了选举舞弊。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: thousands and thousands of counterfeit ballots for Joe Biden. these ballots, this evidence shows election fraud.

</details>

**Michael Baro**: 现在，最近，你看到总统又回到了这个话题上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Baro**: Now, very recently, you've seen the president come back to this subject.

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 很高兴回到美丽的瑞士达沃斯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: It's great to be back in beautiful Davos, Switzerland.

</details>

**Michael Baro**: 例如，上个月总统在瑞士达沃斯发表演讲时，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Baro**: For example, when the president speaks at Davos, Switzerland last month,

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 这是一场被操纵的选举。现在所有人都知道了，他们已经查明了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: it was a rigged election. Everybody now knows that they found out.

</details>

**Michael Baro**: 他谈到了2020年的选举。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Baro**: He talks about the 2020 election.

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 做这件事的人很快就会被起诉。这可能是突发新闻，但它应该是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: People will soon be prosecuted for what they did. It's probably breaking news, but it should be.

</details>

**Michael Baro**: 他预测会有人被起诉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Baro**: And he predicts that there will be prosecutions of people.

</details>

### 特朗普的介入与法律风险

**Michael Baro**: 但是德文，总统在达沃斯这样的地方发出的威胁如何才能变成现实呢？在几乎没有证据表明任何舞弊发生的情况下，他如何能促成这次对富尔顿县投票设施的FBI搜查呢？所以，政府将此案指派给密苏里州的一名联邦检察官。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Baro**: But Devin, how does the president start to make the threats that he issued in a place like Davos turn into reality? And how does he get to this FBI search of this voting facility in Fulton County given the highly public lack of evidence that any fraud ever occurred? So the administration assigns this case to a federal prosecutor in Missouri.

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 密苏里州，不是佐治亚州。这似乎值得注意。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: Missouri, not Georgia. That seems notable,

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 对吧？这项调查工作，在佐治亚州的这次搜查，并不是由亚特兰大的检察官监督的，我认为这值得注意，因为亚特兰大的联邦检察官办公室几年前就已经审查过此事，并决定没有值得追究的地方。嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: right? This investigative effort, this search in Georgia is not being overseen by a prosecutor in Atlanta, which I think is noteworthy because the federal prosecutor's office in Atlanta had already looked at this years earlier and decided there was nothing to pursue. Mhm.

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 除此之外，密苏里州的联邦检察官，另一个推动此事向前发展的关键人物是图尔西·加巴德，国家情报总监。她领导着一个机构，坦率地说，该机构应该关注外国安全威胁、网络威胁。而非常奇怪的是，她去了搜查现场。她去了富尔顿县的选举中心大楼，并作为搜查小组的一员在现场。而这并不是FBI搜查的正常运作方式。这肯定不是我以前见过的任何DNI或任何高级FBI官员会做的事情。你知道，如果你想回想一下FBI搜查海湖庄园的事情，那也不是高级FBI官员负责搜查。那是特工人员做的。当然有经理在那里，但他们不是让各机构的负责人来主持。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: And in addition to the federal prosecutor in Missouri, the other key person driving this forward is Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence. She runs an agency that frankly is supposed to be looking at foreign security threats, cyber threats. And very oddly, she goes to the scene of this search. She goes to the election hub building in Fulton County and is on scene as part of the search group. And that is not the normal way of running an FBI search. That is certainly not something that I've seen before with any DNI or for that matter with any senior FBI official. You know, if you want to cast back to something like the FBI search at Mara Lago, it's not like there were senior FBI officials running that search. That was done by bureau personnel. There were managers there certainly, but they weren't having the heads of agencies run it.

</details>

**Michael Baro**: 所以，根据你的说法，总统获得这次FBI搜查的方式是，他拼凑了一群愿意为他做这件事的人。其中一人是国家情报总监。而且正如你所说，她最终出现在这次FBI搜查的现场，这似乎非常不寻常。有什么能解释这一点吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Baro**: So, from what you're saying, the way the president gets this FBI search is he kind of cobbles together a group of willing participants who will do this for him. one of whom is the director of national intelligence. And as you're saying, that seems highly unusual that she would end up at the scene of this FBI search. What could explain that?

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 我们的报道发现，总统命令她去的。总统告诉她去，她是在他的指示下在那里，并且代表他行事。我认为这说明了总统对这次调查有多么个人化地感兴趣。总统正在亲自推动这项调查。而且，我认为，这也说明了他政府中那些愿意为他做这种事的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: What our reporting has found is that the president ordered her to go. The president told her to go and she is there on his direction and she is acting on his behalf. And I think it speaks to the degree to which the president is personally interested in this investigation. The president is personally pushing forward this investigation. And it speaks to, I think, the people within his administration that are willing to do this kind of thing for him.

</details>

**Michael Baro**: 对。好吧，我们再来谈谈加巴德，就一会儿，以及她为什么愿意这样做。正如你所说，这似乎不是她最自然的利用时间的方式，但加巴德出名地似乎想取悦总统。我们知道这一点，因为很多个月前，她曾公开声称，在没有证据的情况下，前总统巴拉克·奥巴马可能因其政府启动了特朗普-俄罗斯调查而触犯了法律。她曾建议奥巴马可能应该被指控犯罪。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Baro**: Right. Well, let's keep talking about Gabbard for just a moment and why she would be willing to do this. As you're saying, this doesn't exactly seem like the most natural use of her time, but Gabbard famously seems to want to please the president. And we know that because many months ago, she publicly claimed without evidence that former President Barack Obama had potentially criminally violated the law because his administration began the Trump Russia investigation. She suggested that perhaps Obama should be charged with a crime.

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 对。我认为你在整个政府中都看到了她夸大许多特朗普总统自己提出的毫无根据的指控和怀疑的例子。所以，我认为她一直是特朗普推动寻找2020年所谓选民舞弊证据的积极参与者，也是特朗普试图针对那些因2020年输掉选举而不喜欢的人建立刑事案件的积极推动者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: Right. And I think you've seen throughout the administration instances where she has played up many of the unfounded accusations, many of the suspicions that President Trump promotes himself. And so I think she has been a very eager participant in Trump's push to find purported evidence of voter fraud in 2020 and Trump's push to try to build a criminal case against people he doesn't like over the fact that he lost the election in 2020.

</details>

**Michael Baro**: 明白了。所以这就是我们得到国家情报总监基本上作为总统的耳目去参加这次FBI搜查的原因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Baro**: Got it. So that's how we get the director of national intelligence basically going to this FBI raid as the president's eyes and ears.

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 对。没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: Right. Exactly.

</details>

**Michael Baro**: 当FBI特工们正在搜集所有这些选票和投票技术时，加巴德在现场到底做了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Baro**: And what does Gabbard actually do at the scene when FBI agents are grabbing all of these ballots and voting technologies?

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 对。所以，对于国家情报总监来说，在搜查现场并没有太多事情可做，但她被看到在现场做的事情是和某人打电话。她在走动。她很显眼，她就在那里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: Right. So, there's not really much for a director of national intelligence to do at a search, but what she is seen doing when she's there is talking to someone on the phone. She's walking around. She's visible. She's present.

</details>

**Michael Baro**: 有点像在徘徊。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Baro**: Kind of lurking.

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 是的。所以，这很重要而且不寻常。但更不寻常的是搜查结束后发生的事情，当时她与一些参与搜查的FBI特工会面。这次会面确实揭示了很多关于总统对此事的兴趣，而且也可能最终削弱总统试图实现的一切。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: Yeah. And so, that's significant and unusual. But what's far more unusual is what happens after the search when she has a meeting with some of the FBI agents who conducted the search. And that meeting really reveals a lot about the president's interest in all this and also may end up undercutting everything the president is trying to achieve.

</details>

**Michael Baro**: 我们马上回来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Baro**: We'll be right back.

</details>

**Michael Baro**: 所以德文，请告诉我们关于图尔西·加巴德，国家情报总监，在FBI搜查后举行的这次会面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Baro**: So Delvin, tell us about this meeting that Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, has after the FBI search.

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 对。搜查结束后，图尔西·加巴德去了FBI外勤办公室，与一些参与搜查的特工交谈。高级官员访问FBI外勤办公室并非完全闻所未闻。特工们有时会得到VIP访问，但会面中发生的事情很快就变得非常奇怪，并且让一些人感到担忧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: Right. So after the search, Tulsi Gabbard goes to the FBI field office to talk to some of the agents who worked the search. And it's not completely unheard of for a senior official to visit the FBI field office. The agents sometimes get VIP visits, but what happens in the meeting quickly becomes quite strange and quite concerning to some people.

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 发生的事情是，当她与特工们交谈时，她决定给特朗普总统打电话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: What happens is while she's talking to the agents, she decides to call President Trump.

</details>

**Michael Baro**: 她第一次打电话没有接通，但很快，特朗普就回拨给她了。然后图尔西·加巴德把特朗普总统接通到免提，让其他特工和他通话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Baro**: And the first time she calls, she doesn't get through, but very quickly after that, Trump calls her back. And Tulsi Gabbard puts President Trump on speaker phone to talk to the other agents.

</details>

**Michael Baro**: 呃。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Baro**: Huh.

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 我们被告知，起初总统只是在感谢他们，称赞他们的工作。但然后他开始问一些问题，这时房间里的主管试图基本上负责回答那些问题，因为现在你进入了一个非常棘手的领域，总统本人正在向一线特工，那些在现场工作的人提问。你知道，整件事在法律上都极其危险和复杂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: And what's described to us is that at first the president is essentially just thanking them and praising them for their work. But then he starts to ask some questions and at that point the supervisor in the room tries to essentially run point on answering those questions because now you're getting into a very dicey area where the president himself is asking questions of the field agents, the people on the ground doing the work and you know the whole thing is incredibly legally fraught and complicated.

</details>

**Michael Baro**: 好吧，请解释一下为什么这在法律上是“fraught”（危险的）。我可以想象在实际操作上为什么是“fraught”，因为突然之间，你有一群FBI特工在与美国总统谈论一个正在进行的调查。但从法律上讲，问题是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Baro**: Well, just explain why it's legally fraught. I can imagine practically why it's fraud because suddenly you have a bunch of FBI agents talking with the president of the United States about a live investigation. But but legally, what's the issue?

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 对吧？我的意思是，从基本层面来说，这看起来很糟糕，对吧？你有一个要求进行这次调查的人，一个有政治权势的人，现在却在与那些据称正在进行独立且基于事实的调查的人交谈。但从法律上讲，它是有问题的，原因不同但相关。这就是我们在这个政府中已经看到的一些事情，即特朗普希望发生的起诉，部分原因是他如此公开和积极地要求起诉某些人，而导致这些起诉失败了。你在前FBI局长詹姆斯·科米和纽约总检察长莱蒂西亚·詹姆斯（Leticia James）的案件中看到了这一点。在那里，你看到了关于报复性起诉的论点。而政府的论点是为了反驳报复性起诉的说法，就是，好吧，总统说什么并不重要，因为是调查人员和检察官在推进案件。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: Right? I mean, on a basic level, it's a bad look, right? You have the person who has demanded this investigation, the politically powerful person who's demanded this investigation now talking to the people who are supposedly doing an independent and very fact-based investigation. But it's legally problematic for a different but related reason. And that is one of the things we've seen already in this administration is prosecutions that Trump wanted to see happen have fallen apart in part because he has so publicly and aggressively demanded certain people be prosecuted. You see that in the cases against the former FBI director James Comey. You see that in the case against the New York Attorney General Leticia James. There you saw arguments being made about vindictive prosecution. And what the administration has argued to sort of counter claims of vindictive prosecution is well it doesn't matter what the president says because it's the investigators and the prosecutors who are pursuing the case.

</details>

**Michael Baro**: 对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Baro**: Right?

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 好吧，如果你让总统直接与调查人员交谈，那么就很难争辩说总统的意愿与调查人员正在做的事情之间没有联系。所以你正在为任何可能被起诉的人，如果有人被起诉的话，创造一个连接点，让他们可以辩称，看，这是不公正的。这是不公平的。这个案子应该被驳回，因为总统正在与调查人员实时交谈，而他们还在调查中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: Well, if you have the president talking directly to the investigators, it suddenly becomes much harder to argue that there isn't a connection between what the president wants and what the investigators are doing. So you're sort of creating connective tissue for anyone who's ever charged in this, if anyone ever is, to argue, look, this is unjust. This is unfair. This case should be thrown out because the president is talking to the investigators in real time while they're still investigating.

</details>

**Michael Baro**: 对。你的意思是，在某个时候，当理论上某个负责2020年富尔顿县选举计票的人被起诉，基于这次搜查，你可以想象在审判中，FBI特工可能会被传唤到证人席上，就特朗普与他们讨论调查一事作证，这非常清楚地表明了特朗普多么希望这些人被起诉，他对此有多么个人化地投入，而这将有助于构成报复性起诉的论据，并可能最终导致任何被提出的指控被撤销。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Baro**: Right. You're saying at some point when in theory somebody who ran the Fulton County election counting in 2020 is charged with a crime based on this search, you can imagine at trial perhaps FBI agents being called to the stand to testify about Trump discussing the investigation with them and it very much making clear how much Trump wanted these people to be charged, how personally he invested he was in all this and that that would help make the case for vindictive prosecution and perhaps ultimately get whatever charges were brought tossed.

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 对吧？所以，无论从法律上，还是从政治上或常识上来说，有很多原因可以解释为什么这样做不好，如果你们 ever 想建立一个刑事案件的话。所以，我们在这里看到的是，特朗普总统这种不懈的亲力亲为的方式，针对这个特定的调查，2020年选举，富尔顿县，在前端得到了特朗普想要的东西。我的意思是，那些选票被搜走了，但它开始削弱他后端获得他想要的东西的能力，也就是让选举官员入狱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: Right? So, there's a lot of reasons why legally, forget just politically or common sense wise, legally this is not great if you ever want to try to build a criminal case out of this. So, what we're seeing here is that this relentlessly hands-on approach from President Trump to this particular investigation, the 2020 election, Fulton County, it's getting Trump what he wants on the front end. I mean, those ballots were seized, but it's starting to undermine his ability to get what he wants on the back end, which is election officials in prison,

</details>

**Michael Baro**: 对吧？而且说实话，这符合他对自己第二任期的看法。他一再表示，我是美国的首席执法官。我领导FBI，我领导司法部。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Baro**: right? And to be fair, this is in keeping with how he views himself in this second term. He has said repeatedly, I am the chief law enforcement official in the United States. I run the FBI and I run the Justice Department,

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 不是总检察长，不是FBI，是我，总统。所以你看到的是他根据这种信念行事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: not the attorney general, not the FBI, me, the president. So what you see is him acting on that belief.

</details>

**Michael Baro**: 但我认为，法院接受这种行为是适当的，或者这种行为能够经受住法庭的挑战，这之间存在很大差异。德文，富尔顿县的选举官员，他们刚刚经历了这次突袭，这次搜查，他们对此事的回应是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Baro**: But I think that's a big difference from the courts accepting that this is appropriate behavior or this is the kind of behavior that will survive challenges in court. M Delvin, how are the election officials in Fulton County who have just been subjected to this raid, to this search? How are they responding to what has happened?

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 我们绝不向那些企图控制富尔顿县选举的人让步。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: we will not give one inch to those who seek to take control of elections in Fulton County.

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 他们已经发誓要将政府告上法庭来对抗此事，基本上要求把证据还给他们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: They have already vowed to take the government to court to fight this, to essentially demand the evidence back

</details>

**Michael Baro**: 和他们一起。他们打开箱子了吗？他们往里面塞了其他选票吗？我不知道。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Baro**: with them. Are they opening the boxes? Are they stuffing other ballots in there? I have no clue.

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 他们说，他们不习惯特朗普政府控制这些选票。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: They say they're not comfortable with the Trump administration having control of these ballots.

</details>

**Michael Baro**: 他不想让中期选举夺走他的权力。所以，他试图制造混乱。所以，这就是他。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Baro**: He does not want the midterm elections to take away his power. So, he's trying to create chaos. So, this is what he

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 几位地方选举官员甚至表示，FBI的搜查应该让每个人都感到害怕，因为对他们来说，这实际上是关于2026年的下一次选举，中期选举。不惜一切代价保护你的投票。我告诉你，每个人总是说你的生命取决于它。哦，这次你的生命确实取决于它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: Few local election officials have gone further saying that the FBI search should scare everyone because this to them is really about the next election in 2026, the midterms. protect your vote at all costs. I'm telling you, everybody always says your life depends on it. Oh, your life does depend on it this time.

</details>

**Michael Baro**: 他们在那里是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Baro**: And what do they mean there?

</details>

**Devlin Barrett**: 听着，我认为很多选举专家和很多民主党人的担忧是，政府可能在未来某个时候试图利用这些舞弊指控来支持他们的论点，即某些选票不应被计算，或者某些结果是不正确的。而这些担忧不仅仅基于富尔顿县的这次搜查。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: Look, I think the concern for a lot of election experts and a lot of Democrats is that the administration may at some point in the future try to use these claims of fraud to buttress their argument that some votes should not be counted or some results are not the right results. And those concerns are based on more than just this search in Fulton County.

</details>

**Michael Baro**: 在过去一年里，特朗普的司法部已经提起了诉讼，寻求几乎一半州的人口统计数据、选民的个人信息。这是以前从未做过的事情。这非常不同，也与迄今为止的投票管理方式不符。我认为很多正在与特朗普政府就此类事务进行斗争的州，看到了一个更大的模式，即试图播下对选举公正性的怀疑，为可能在2026年挑战结果做准备，如果结果不符合特朗普的意愿。嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Baro**: Over the last year, Trump's Justice Department has filed lawsuits seeking voter role data, personal information about voters in almost half the states in the country. And that is something that hasn't been done before. That is very different and out of keeping with how voting has been managed up till now. And I think a lot of the states who are fighting the Trump administration over these types of things see a larger pattern of trying to sow doubt about the integrity of elections, trying to prepare the groundwork for maybe challenging results in 2026 if it doesn't go Trump's way. Mhm.

**Devlin Barrett**: 那是2026年的选举，你知道，众议院有可能被民主党控制，这将大大限制特朗普总统在未来两年的权力。

**Devlin Barrett**: That's an election in which, you know, there's certainly a possibility that the House of Representatives could become democratically controlled and that would significantly curtail Trump's power as president over the following two years.

**Michael Baro**: 对吧？而且我们知道，对选举的怀疑，在这一点上，是特朗普运动的核心。而这些怀疑需要煽动。而这次FBI搜查富尔顿县的选举中心，就是一种煽动行为。它将选举怀疑、选举否认主义的问题重新带回美国人的视野，而此时大多数人并没有真正考虑它。

**Michael Baro**: Right? And as we know, doubts about election are just at this point central to the Trump movement. And those doubts require stoking. And this FBI search of this Fulton County election hub is an act of stoking. It puts the issue of election doubt, election denialism back on the radar for Americans at a time when most people aren't really thinking about it.

**Devlin Barrett**: 想一分钟，FBI调查是什么。就其性质而言，FBI调查会播下怀疑和不信任的种子，关于被调查的人。总统多年来一直在播下对选举的怀疑和不信任的种子，当他不在权力位置上时，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Devlin Barrett**: Think for a minute about what an FBI investigation is. By its very nature, an FBI investigation sows doubt and sows suspicion about the people being investigated. The president has been sewing doubt and suspicion about elections for years when he was out of power, right?

</details>

**Michael Baro**: 而现在你看到的是，既然他掌权了，他就可以利用政府的杠杆。他可以利用像FBI这样的机制来播下那种怀疑和不信任的种子。而那种怀疑和不信任就变成了政府的官方立场。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Baro**: And now what you're seeing is that now that he's in power, he can use the levers of government. He can use the mechanics of something like the FBI to sew that doubt and sew that suspicion. And that doubt and suspicion becomes the official posture of the government.

**Michael Baro**: And a proposed deal to end a partial government shutdown reached last week by President Trump and Senate Democrats has stumbled in the House where some Republicans are threatening to block its passage. Several hardline conservatives have demanded policy changes to the funding package, including a requirement that people show identification before voting.
