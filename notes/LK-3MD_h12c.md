title: 体育商业巨头的激情与风险：杰里·琼斯与亚历克斯·罗德里格斯的对话
---

### 体育商业的激情之旅

主持人: 好的。我们这档节目去过很多地方，但这是我们第一次来到达拉斯的“星光基地”（The Star）。这是琼斯家族的创意，我们今天将与本人——杰里·琼斯先生对话。很高兴见到您。

<p class="english-text">All right. So we've taken this show many places, but this is our first time in Dallas at The Star. This is the brainchild of the Jones family, and we're talking to the man himself, Jerry Jones. Good to see you.</p>
</details>

Alex Rodriguez: 杰里是作为老板的我的“北极星”。他将这支球队从他收购时的状态带到了今天，这简直令人难以置信。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jerry's my North Star as an owner. And what he is done with this franchise, taking it where he bought it from to where it is today. Pretty incredible.</p>
</details>

主持人: 没有人做得比他更好。确实没有人能打造出地球上最有价值的体育特许经营权。达拉斯牛仔队（Dallas Cowboys）的估值高达130亿美元。我们将从杰里·琼斯那里学到很多经验。我等不及了。开始吧。杰里·琼斯，非常感谢您在德克萨斯州接待我们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">No one's done it better. Literally no one has built a more valuable sports franchise on the planet. $13 billion is the estimated value of the Dallas Cowboys. Lots of lessons that we're gonna learn from Jerry Jones. I can't wait. Let's do it. Jerry Jones, thank you so much for having us here in Texas.</p>
</details>

Jerry Jones: 嗯，首先，我很荣幸你们能来。我们正俯瞰着球场，我也为球场周围的“星光基地”感到自豪。所以，感谢你们来到“星光基地”。很高兴能和你们两位在一起。亚历克斯，我很高兴看到我的老邻居回到达拉斯。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, first of all, I'm proud you are here. We're overlooking the field, and I'm kind of proud of what's around the field as well with our Star. So thanks for coming to the Star. Great to be with both of you. And Alex, I'm so proud to see my neighbor, my old neighbor back here in Dallas.</p>
</details>

主持人: 没错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's right.</p>
</details>

主持人: 那么亚历克斯，我让你先开始吧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Alex, I'm gonna let you kick it off.</p>
</details>

Alex Rodriguez: 是的。杰森，当我第一次决定要拥有一支球队时，这是我从青少年时期就一直梦想的事情，但我当然出身卑微。但我说，我必须和一位老板谈谈，那就是杰里·琼斯先生。我给夏洛特打了个电话。那是在新冠疫情期间。我们当时正试图收购大都会队。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So, you know, Jason, when I first decided that I wanted to own a team, this is something I've been dreaming about for forever and ever since I was a teenager, but of course I come from very humble beginnings. But I said, there's one owner I must talk to, and that's Mr. Jerry Jones. And I made a call to Charlotte. This was around COVID time. We were taking a run at, at the Mets</p>
</details>

主持人: 杰里的女儿，夏洛特·琼斯。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jerry's daughter, Charlotte Jones. Yeah,</p>
</details>

Alex Rodriguez: 夏洛特·琼斯。我说，也许几周后她能让琼斯先生接电话，因为他非常忙。但夏洛特很快就回复了我：“嘿，杰里很想和你谈谈。周三两点怎么样？”我说：“搞定。”我以为会是15分钟的谈话。结果，90分钟后，我记了满满几页笔记，他给了我一些我永远不会忘记的、最不可思议的建议。为此，我非常感激。所以那个电话对我意义重大。你告诉我的一切，以及我从乔治·斯坦布伦纳（George Steinbrenner）和其他我尊重和钦佩的人那里学到的东西，我今天作为明尼苏达森林狼队（Minnesota Timberwolves）和明尼苏达山猫队（Minnesota Lynx）的老板，都会思考这些。所以谢谢你。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Charlotte Jones. I said, boy, but tell you, maybe in a couple weeks she'll get Mr. Jones on. 'cause he is very busy. And Charlotte hits me up right back. Hey, Jerry would love to talk to you. How's Wednesday at two o'clock? I said, done. And I thought it was gonna be 15 minutes. And boy, I tell you what, ninety minutes later I have like pages and pages of notes, and he gave me, you gave me the most incredible advice that I'll never forget. And for that, I'm very grateful. So that, that call really meant a lot to me. And a lot of what you told me along with what I learned from George Steinbrenner and others that I respect and admire, I think about that as an owner today of the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Minnesota Lynx. So thank you for that.</p>
</details>

Jerry Jones: 嗯，恭喜你。你知道，当你告诉我你将参与到球队所有权层面时，这在情理之中。你一直想拥有球队的事实也说明了一切。因为在我看来，这之间有一种联系。这是一种激情。你可以称之为竞争力，但它是在完成那些难以实现的事情。你提到了乔治·斯坦布伦纳，在我早期拥有牛仔队的那些日子里，我总会收到他寄来的一张漂亮的便条，我总是很期待。他会给我一些我称之为“甜言蜜语”的东西。我把它们放在一个专门的文件夹里。那些都是日常的鼓励。因为当时有很多批评，因为我们收购牛仔队的方式，更换了教练，坦率地说，做了很多改变。世界上所有的人中，能收到那些鼓励的便条，告诉我“坚持下去，继续努力”，这对我意义重大。我有一个传承。我们，乔治·斯坦布伦纳家族和我的家族，共同成立了一家名为“传奇”（Legends）的公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, congratulations. And you know, the minute that you told me you were gonna get involved at the ownership level, it just made all the sense in the world. The fact that you had always wanted to be in ownership says it all as well. Because in my mind, there is a connection. It's a passion. It, you can call it competitiveness, but it's accomplishing things that are hard to do. But, you know, you mentioned George Steinbrenner and my early days with the Cowboys, I'd get a nice note and I always look forward to it, and it would be from him. And he would give me, I call 'em my sweet nothings. I put 'em in a file that I had that for. But it were daily encouragements. And because there was a lot of criticism because of, of the way that we bought the Cowboys, changed the coaches out, and frankly did a lot of changes. Well, of all the people in the world to be getting those nice encouraging notes that boy stick in there. Keep it going. I've got a legacy there. And we, George Steinbrenner, the family and my family set up a company called Legends.</p>
</details>

主持人: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

Jerry Jones: 当然，那是很多年以后的事了。在讨论“传奇”公司时，我与他见过几次面。“传奇”公司服务于许多体育项目，也服务于体育设施和球迷参与的过程。但我永远不会忘记，乔治·斯坦布伦纳在我们会面时对大家说：“我不需要任何书面文件。你们不用花钱或时间在那份合同上。我和他握个手，我们就有了让这项业务成功所需的一切。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that was of course, many years later. And I got to meet with him several times as we were talking about legends And Legends serves many, many sports, and it serves facilities and the process of really fan engagement. I'll never forget though. George Steinbrenner told the group when we met, he said, I don't need anything written down. You, you don't spend any money or time on that contract over there. He and I will shake hands and we'll have all we need to make this business work.</p>
</details>

### 商业模式与风险承担

主持人: 杰里，你提到了你进入所有权领域，以及导致这一切的许多因素。当亚历克斯打电话给你，说他要投资**NBA**（National Basketball Association: 美国职业篮球联赛）和**WNBA**（Women's National Basketball Association: 美国女子职业篮球联赛）时，没有人会怀疑那是一笔好交易。但当你收购达拉斯牛仔队时，人们认为你疯了。人们认为那是一笔糟糕的生意，你付的钱太多了。是什么让你确信这是一笔好交易？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Jerry, you know, you, you mentioned you getting into ownership and, and a lot that led to that. You know, when Alex calls you and says he's going to, you know, buy into the NBA and the WNBA, no one would doubt that that was a good deal when you bought the Dallas Cowboys, People thought you were insane. People thought it was a bad business and that you are overpaying. What gave you the certitude that this was a good deal?</p>
</details>

Jerry Jones: 嗯，那确实是激情。正如激情可以在生活的许多方面帮助你一样，我真的没有看到那些明显的障碍。我就是没有看到它们。现在你可能会说：“你难道看不到每个月亏损一百万美元吗？你瞎了吗？你买牛仔队的时候喝了多少酒？”重点是，我寻找方法，这很常见。我寻找那些可能有点雄心勃勃的方法，但我寻找解决每一个问题的方法。虽然可能希望渺茫，可能这些方法中带有一点想象力，但我接受了这些问题，并且我认为我有一个解决方案来应对它们。当你非常渴望做某事时，你就会这样做。是的，牛仔队当时令人望而生畏。但重点是，这种兴趣一直都在，参与其中，并以一种能让它变得更好的方式参与，而不是像A-Rod那样挥棒或阻挡，我作为一名忠实球迷当然很欣赏他的表现，但我是以一种能让球队变得更好的方式参与。我当时在世界上任何地方都找不到一支能赚钱的体育特许经营权。你看，体育一直是一个伟大的展示者，展示体育的本质。它被称为宣传。在我看来，宣传与营销的区别在于，宣传拥有大量的受众。它拥有巨大的兴趣，并且可以创造兴趣。而营销是当你利用这种宣传，将其带回家，制定一个计划来将其中的一部分变现，然后走出去获得回报，并有足够的回报来再次投入。这被称为商业模式。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it, it truly was passion. And just as passion can help you in many aspects of life, I really didn't see those obvious obstacles. I just didn't see them. Now you say, well, can't you see losing a million dollars a month? Are you blind? What, what? How much were you drinking when you bought the, when you bought the Cowboys? Well, the point is, I looked for ways, and this is common. I looked for ways that were maybe a little ambitious, but I looked for ways to solve every one of those problems. And while there may have been long odds, there may have been a little imagination in those ways. I took those problems and I thought I had a solution as to how to address them. That's what you will do when you wanna do it real bad. And yes, the Cowboys, it was daunting. But the point is that it was always there. The interest in becoming involved and becoming involved in a way that, let's say, unlike A-Rod becoming in a way that didn't swing the bat or didn't make the block, which I certainly appreciated as a great fan, but becoming involved in a way that would make it better. I found no sports franchise anywhere in the world that was making any money. You see, sports had been a great, great portrayer of what sports is about. It's called publicity. Well the difference in publicity in my point of view than marketing, is that publicity has great audiences. It has great, if you will, interest and can create interest. Marketing is when you take that publicity and you bring it home and set up a plan to monetize some of it and go out and get that and have enough coming back in to go again. That's called a business model.</p>
</details>

主持人: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

Jerry Jones: 体育不仅拥有巨大的激情，以及每个人天生的竞争本能和对那些做到这一点的人的欣赏，而且体育拥有这种巨大的、巨大的宣传和巨大的理解。但它却没有一个商业模式来使其成为营销，让你能够收回一点并再次投入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, sports had not only the great passion and the natural instincts of competing in everybody and the appreciation of people that do, but sports had this massive, massive publicity and massive understanding. But yet it had no business model to make it call marketing where you could bring back a little and go again.</p>
</details>

主持人: 对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right.</p>
</details>

Jerry Jones: 那对我来说是完全必要的，因为我无法再次投入。坦率地说，我当时的情况是，我拥有的钱不足以满足需求。但由于**NFL**（National Football League: 美国职业橄榄球大联盟）和牛仔队当时确实发展缓慢，我们在财务上陷入困境，坦率地说，正因为如此，NFL知道他们有问题。银行家们不担心我，因为他们没有在牛仔队上贷款。银行家们是根据我的一笔应收账款放贷的。所以，我得以通过审批，但却没有留下任何钱去收购那些我已签约同意收购的普通合伙人，但我没有钱去做那件事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That was totally necessary for me because I couldn't go again. Now what happened with me was, candidly, is that the amount of money I had wasn't what was needed. But because the NFL and the Cowboys were, were really slow, we were really down and out financially, frankly, because of that, then the NFL knew they had a problem. The bankers didn't worry about me because they didn't loan anything on the Cowboys. The bankers loaned it on a receivable that I had. And so the approval of me getting through the door and still not having any money left to go buy the general partners that I had agreed under contract to go buy out, but I didn't have the money to go do that.</p>
</details>

主持人: 杰里，就这些方面而言，回到1989年，你当时每个月亏损一百万美元。我还听说你曾说过，你可能想收购一家有**现金流**（Cash Flowing: 指企业在一定时期内现金的流入与流出）的企业来抵消一些损失。当你考虑填补这些漏洞时，那有压力吗？你的策略是什么？请告诉我们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Jerry, along those lines, so go back to 1989, you're losing a million dollars per month now. I heard you also say that you may have wanted to buy a business that was cash flowing to offset some of those losses. As you think about filling those holes, was that stressful? And what was your strategy? Walk us through that</p>
</details>

Jerry Jones: 就个人而言，我在大学时对体育运动有着极大的自豪感和经验，在阿肯色州的大学四年级，我们赢得了全国冠军。虽然我受过销售保险的培训，我可以非常努力地推销。但我真正没有受过培训的是财务方面。所以我认为，因为我能讲一个好故事，并且可以借到所有的钱，那就是前进的方向。所以在我大学毕业后的头一两年，我借的钱多得数不清。我毕业后的第一年，我的佣金大概是3万美元。我的利息是15万美元。这让你知道我当时有多么“超前”（over my skis）。这花了我好几年时间。我的妻子吉恩（Gene）的钱包被抢走，信用卡被剪成两半，账单催收员上门。所以我真的学到了如何不去做买卖的教训。嗯，我设法度过了难关，那是我有过的最伟大的教育。然后我很幸运，在经历了所有那些“超前”的打击之后，我在石油和天然气业务中获得了一些真正的资金。在所有这些之后，为了向你展示我当时有多么充满激情或疯狂，在经历了那段认为旧的财务死亡已经来临的时期后，我转头收购了达拉斯牛仔队。这表明了其中蕴含的激情有多大。但我记得我们和亚历克斯谈话时，我说：“听着，我说，没有什么，没有什么能阻挡激情。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">On a personal basis. I had such pride and such an experience in sport when I was in college and my senior year at Arkansas, we won the national championship. While I had been schooled in selling insurance, I could gnaw that leg off the chair selling. But what I hadn't done was been really schooled in financial. And so I thought because I could tell a good story and could borrow all that money, that that was the way to go. And so my first year or two outta college, I borrowed more money than you could even count. And my first year outta school, I think my commissions were $30,000. My interest was $150,000. To give you an idea how over my skis I had gotten, it took me years. It took my Gene, my wife, getting her purse taken out of her hands and cards, credit cards cut in two, it took the bill players coming. So I had really gotten a lesson in how not to do it as far as buying something. Well, I managed to come through that and it was the greatest education that I'd ever had. Well, then I was very fortunate and got some real finances with the oil and gas business after all that butt kicking that I got for getting out over my skis. After all of that, to show you how passionate or crazy I was after going through that of thinking that the old financial death had been at ray, I turned around and bought the Dallas Cowboys. That shows you how much passion was involved. But I remember when we talked Alex, I said, listen, I said, nothing, nothing can stand in the way of passion.</p>
</details>

### 激进变革与关键交易

主持人: 我想亚历克斯可能会证实这一点，当他去收购一支球队时，他得到的建议之一是：“坐着别动，不要做任何大动作，不要突然行动。不要马上解雇很多人。”你没有听从这个建议。基本上，你一进来就解雇了这位传奇教练。你解雇了所有人，从公共广播员到宣传主管和总经理。你看到了什么让他们如此错误，以至于你觉得必须立即采取行动？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think Alex would probably validate this, that when he goes to buy a team, part of the advice that he gets is sit, don't make any big moves, no sudden moves. Don't get rid of a bunch of people Right away, you didn't follow that advice. Basically, the minute you come in, you get rid of this legendary coach. You fired everybody from the guy in the announcing the public announcements to the head of publicity and the general manager. Why, what did you see that was so wrong with them that you felt like you immediately had to act?</p>
</details>

Jerry Jones: 当你收购某物时，你必须假设卖方知道它目前的价值。给他们信用，或者他们的债权人肯定知道。他们知道这项业务是什么。所以一个大错误就是不自动地建立，知道你必须改变现状。如果你支付了你将要支付的钱，就假设他们得到了最高价，并且在拿到你的钱时已经接受了。所以你必须真正带着改变的想法进入。当牛仔队的情况如此严重失衡时，我必须进行彻底的改变，而且我必须立即行动。所以当时有一种紧迫感。你没有时间去“享受”，可以说。再加上，我再怎么强调也不为过，我感觉自己就像赫歇尔·沃克（Herschel Walker）冲过防线一样，只是不断地反弹。各种障碍不断出现。当然，糟糕的一天在哪里？嗯，我不可能有糟糕的一天，因为我正在做我一生都想做的事情。那主宰了一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You have to assume when you buy something that who you buy it from knows what it's worth, like it is. Give them credit or certainly their creditors might know. They know what the business is. So a big mistake is not to automatically build in, know that you've gotta change the scenery. If you pay what you're going to pay, assume they're getting top dollar and have taken it when they got your money. So you have to really go in thinking change. When it was as dramatically outta kelter as the Cowboys were, I had to have radical change and I had to do it yesterday. So there was an urgency. You didn't have time to have a good time, so to speak. That plus, again, the fact that I can't emphasize enough, I felt like Herschel Walker running through the line, it was just bouncing off of me. There were all kinds of hurdles that were popping. And of course, where was the bad day? Well, I couldn't have a bad day because I was getting to do something that I'd wanted to do all my life. And that ruled the day.</p>
</details>

主持人: 你做过的另一笔最重要的交易之一是，你提到了赫歇尔·沃克，你把他送走了，你把他交易了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So one of the other most seminal deals that that you make is, you mentioned Herschel Walker got rid of him, you traded him.</p>
</details>

Jerry Jones: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah.</p>
</details>

主持人: 结果证明，这可以说是足球史上最精彩的交易之一。当时看起来并非如此。请告诉我们这个决定是如何做出的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It turns out to be arguably one of the most brilliant trades in, in the history of football. Did not seem that way at the time. Talk us through that decision.</p>
</details>

Jerry Jones: 如果你考虑做出改变，赫歇尔·沃克无疑是一个改变。他是我们最好的球员，这是众所周知的。在这种特殊情况下，你当时是新手，所以你自然不知道自己在做什么。总是如此，当涉及到一位功成名就的人物，无论是体育界还是其他领域，当你“离婚”时，做决定的人总是会看起来很糟糕。毫无疑问，如果你无法处理这一点，那就不要进行交易。或者如果你无法预料到这一点，那就不要进行交易。这在当时是活生生的现实。但它让你做到的不仅仅是你得到的有形对价，当时是**选秀权**（Draft Picks: 职业体育联盟中球队选择新秀球员的权利）。当时还没有**工资帽**（Salary Cap: 职业体育联盟中限制球队总薪资的规定）。但你拥有那些选秀权，那是有形的。那些交易的作用是什么？那些选秀权的作用是让我们不仅可以在选秀中使用它们，还可以用它们进行交易。我们进行了交易，我不会说是随机的，但如果你愿意，我们是“不计后果”地进行的。这让你更像一个玩家，因为这就像带着钱去拉斯维加斯。我认为毫无疑问，在收购牛仔队的早期，我愿意承担风险，我们组建了球队，球员们组建了我们的阵容。我认为“快刀斩乱麻”的能力非常重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you look at making change, and certainly Herschel Walker was a change, He was the best player we had, and it was well known. In this particular case, you were kind of new on the block, so you automatically didn't know what you were doing. Always. When it's an accomplished name of, whether it's sport or otherwise, always, when you get a divorce there, it's gonna look bad for the one that made the decision. Always. There's no question, if you can't handle that, then don't make the trade. Or if you can't anticipate that, don't make the trade. That's alive and well. But what it caused you to do is not just the tangible consideration you got, which at that time were draft picks. You didn't have a cap at that time. But you had those draft picks and that was the tangible, what those trades did. What those picks did was allow us to use them, not only for using them in the draft, but we used them to trade. Trade. And we did it with, I'm not gonna say randomness, but we did it with reckless abandon, if you want to. It caused you to be more of a player because it was like going to Las Vegas with money in your pocket. And I don't think there's any question that I'm willing to take risk in those early days after having acquired the Cowboys that we built, players built our roster. I think the, the ability to cut and shoot was a big deal.</p>
</details>

### 模糊容忍度与应对批评

主持人: 我听你谈论过模糊性。我从体育的角度思考这个问题。杰里，我曾和一些自由球员一起打球，他们不知道下一笔薪水何时到来，也不知道从何而来。你把一个300打击率的球员变成了215打击率的球员，一个打出30支全垒打的球员因为紧张而打出18支全垒打。商业也是如此，但你拥有这种在不知道接下来会发生什么的情况下仍能保持高水平表现的能力。你认为这是真的吗？如果真的如此，这种能力从何而来？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I've heard you talk about ambiguity. I think about it from the lens of sports. Jerry, There's some guys that I've played with that are free agents and they don't know when that next check's coming from or where it's coming from. And you create a 300 hitter becomes a 215 hitter. A guy that hits thirty home runs, hits eighteen home runs because of the nerves. The same is true in business, but you have this ability to not knowing what's gonna happen next to perform at a high level. Do you believe that's true? And and where does that come from if it is true?</p>
</details>

Jerry Jones: 嗯，我知道这在我的情况下是真的，但我认为这非常真实。一些在专业领域或商业领域最伟大的人，如果他们不知道周末会发生什么，尤其是在财务方面，他们就无法很好地发挥作用。他们需要知道这一点，这样他们才能继续他们的工作，发挥出他们应有的卓越表现。另一方面，有些人，他们对不知道支票金额的模糊性，反而比知道支票金额时表现得更好。他们更聪明，更狡猾，他们只是拥有更多的技能，并且愿意施展出来。我称之为**模糊容忍度**（Tolerance for Ambiguity: 指个体在面对不确定、不完整或矛盾信息时，能够接受并有效处理的能力）。模糊容忍度。经典的，至少是众所周知的故事是那位著名的河船赌徒，他迷人的胡子坐在那里。下一张牌要么让他被扔下船，要么他将拥有这艘船。那正是他人生中最好的时刻。当然，他以前也被扔下过船，也赢过几次船。不同之处在于，我敢打赌，那些迷人的家伙没有一个不会游泳。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I know it's true in my situation, but I think it's very true. And some of the greatest people that have ever been involved in the professions or business, they don't function as well if they don't know what's gonna happen at the end of the week, especially financially, they need to know that so that they can get on with the, their business of being as excellent as they are. On the other hand, there are some people that the ambiguity that's out there of not knowing what your check is, they're better than if they knew what the check was gonna be. They're more clever, they're more cunning, they're more, they've just got more skill and are willing to exert it. I call that tolerance for ambiguity. Tolerance for ambiguity. And the classic, at least known story was the famous riverboat gambler, charming mustache sitting there. The next card up is gonna get him thrown off the boat, or he is gonna own the boat. Now that's when he's the best that he is in his life. And of course he's gotten thrown off that boat before and he's won the boat a few times. The difference is though, I'll bet you not a one of those charming son of a guns didn't know how to swim.</p>
</details>

主持人: 你可以玩那手牌，但你最好知道如何游泳，因为你会被扔下船几次。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Now you can play that hand, but you better know how to swim because you're gonna get thrown off the boat a little bit.</p>
</details>

Jerry Jones: 你被扔下船了。

<p class="english-text">You've gotten thrown off the boat</p>

主持人: 你们俩都被扔下过船。所以，我想在时间上稍微往前推一点，因为你脱颖而出的方式之一就是你的交易能力。你知道，你进来后，成为这个俱乐部的一员，一个现在很多人都想加入的俱乐部。NFL有自己的经营方式，而你在某个时候决定你也许可以做得更好一点。我特别想到的是与耐克（Nike）的交易。

<p class="english-text">You guys have been thrown off some boats together. So I, I do want to, you know, move ahead a little bit chronologically because one of the ways that you step out is with your deal making. You know, you're, you come in, you're part of this club, a club that a lot of people especially now want to be a part of. And NFL has its way of doing business and you at some point decide that you might be able to do this a little bit better. And I'm thinking specifically the Nike deal.</p>
</details>

主持人: 你知道，这位就是耐克运动员。每个人都记得你和菲尔·奈特（Phil Knight）一起走上球场。那笔交易是如何达成的？你是如何决定这样做的，要知道NFL当时已经与锐步（Reebok）有合作，他们做得很好，但你决定你可以做得更好？

<p class="english-text">You know, this is a Nike athlete right here. Everybody remembers you and Phil Knight walking out on that field. How does that deal come about? How do you decide to do that knowing that the NFL, they've got Reebok, they're good, you decide you can do something better.</p>
</details>

Jerry Jones: 我认识一位伟大的教练埃迪·萨顿（Eddie Sutton），他曾告诉我年轻时的菲尔·奈特，他把自己的产品带到他执教的大学，然后从他汽车的后备箱里卖出去，菲尔·奈特就是这样一路走过来的。但对我来说显而易见的是，他把一双鞋，或者说他把性能，或者说从心理上对性能的预期，融入到了一双鞋里。他把这个故事讲得如此出色，以至于他让我觉得如果我穿上那双鞋，我就可以跑得更快。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I had known a great coach named Eddie Sutton, and he had told me about Phil Knight as a young man, bringing his things to where he was coaching in college and selling it out of the trunk that Phil Knight had had that path to where he was. But the thing that was obvious to me was that he took a shoe or he took performance or perspective performance mentally in a shoe. And he did such a good job of telling the story with it that he made me think if I could put the shoe on, I could run faster.</p>

主持人: 对，对。

Jerry Jones: 这与体育的本质以及它如何真正被强调，与我产生了强烈的共鸣。当你看到一位稀有的球员，一位稀有的运动员时，他身上正在发生的事情远不止于此。仅仅是关于他为何稀有的故事，将他与其他球员或竞争对手进行比较，我称之为“一加一等于三”。我将这应用于所有事情。无论是商业决策，体育领域的一加一不是二，而是三。这是因为那个“三”是想象力。那个“三”是让你以某种方式投入其中，让你自己打出全垒打，或者让你自己在观看或思考时身临其境。那个领域是无形的，正因为它是无形的，所以那里是商业中利润最大的地方。而不是在每个人都在做，工程师们都在努力，他们已经把它精简到极致的这个地方。这个想象工程（imagineering），这个想象力部分，让一加一等于三，才是利润所在，坦率地说，也是荣耀所在。

<p class="english-text">And that so hit home with me relative to what sports is about, but really can be accentuated. It truly is the story when you see a rare player, a rare athlete, there's so much more that's going on there with that rare athlete. And just the story of what's making him rare, comparing him to the other players or other competition, I call it one in one is three. And I apply that to everything. Whether it's a business decision, one in one is three in sports, not two, but three. And it's because that three is imagination. That three is putting yourself in in a way, having yourself hit the home run or having yourself there when you're watching or thinking about it. That area right there is an intangible because it is an intangible. That's where the biggest margins are in business. Not down here where everybody's doing it and the engineers are working on it. They've got it whittled down to right there. This area right here that imagineering, that imagination part. That makes one in one three. Is where the margins are and frankly, where the glory is.</p>
</details>

主持人: 我在耐克工作了25年，菲尔·奈特是最棒的合作伙伴。当你做出那个举动时，我很高兴。但我的问题是，当你在家里，在沙发上或其他地方想出这个主意时，从你打电话给菲尔·奈特开始，花了多长时间？那些对话是如何进行的？你是在推销你的想法，说明为什么这是一桩美满的联姻吗？进展如何？你能给我们介绍一些细节吗？

<p class="english-text">I spent my 25 year career with Nike and Phil Knight was just the most amazing partner. And it delighted me when you made that move. But my question is, when you come up with that idea at home, you're thinking in the couch or wherever from the time you call Phil Knight, how long did it take and how do those conversations go? Are you pitching your idea of why this is a great marriage? How does that go? If you can give us a little color?</p>
</details>

Jerry Jones: 我和我的妻子吉恩（Gene）以及儿子杰里（Jerry）一起去了他们的总部拜访他。我永远不会忘记，我当时正在和他的几位同事讨论这可能是什么样子。他走了进来，我们已经进展得很顺利了，他看着我，我永远不会忘记。他说：“我这辈子从未为‘什么都没有’付过这么多钱。”但他又说：“这件事，它有些特别，我喜欢。”当我们最初达成协议时，他不能使用“牛仔队”这个词，也不能使用“星形”标志。

<p class="english-text">I visited with him, my wife Gene and son Jerry went to their headquarters. I'll never forget, I was visiting with a couple of his folks about what this might look like. And he came in and we had gotten pretty far along and he looked over at me, I'll never forget it. And he said, I have never paid so much for nothing in my life. But he said, he said, this thing is something about it. I like, when we initially made our deal, he couldn't use Cowboys or he couldn't use the star.</p>

</details>

Jerry Jones: 我们只是和体育场达成了协议。现在，正如夏洛特所说，她“耐克化”了体育场。我们让那个体育场看起来就像是耐克的总部，但我们没有对球队这样做。我们基本上让球队穿着没有颜色、没有任何赞助商的队服出场。但当我们到达纽约时，我们正在和巨人队比赛。那时我们宣布了这件事。当时，当我们走上球场时，我穿着西装，但脚上穿着耐克网球鞋，菲尔和我一起走出来，我戴着耐克帽子。我们之前和阿尔·迈克尔斯（Al Michaels）见过面，也和丹·迪尔多夫（Dan Dierdorf）见过面，我们在更衣室里见过面。我向他们解释了这是关于什么的，以及它在NFL方面和耐克与牛仔队方面所带来的优势，这使得它成为一个有争议的事情。我永远不会忘记阿尔·迈克尔斯说：“现在，如果我们在这里有一场势均力敌的比赛，下半场我们可能不会过多谈论这个。”嗯，牛仔队在中场休息时取得了相当大的领先优势，所以他们整个半场都在谈论这种关系以及NFL，以及可能发生的事情。第二天早上，菲尔给我打电话，他说：“我这辈子从未花这么少的钱获得如此大的回报。”从那时起，我可以在纽约街头行走，我可以在芝加哥，你会看到汽车里的司机，诸如此类，他们只是指着耐克说：“去搞定他们。”所以这种争议，如果你愿意，这种争议也创造了巨大的兴趣，否则它可能只是一些商业问题，但它创造了巨大的兴趣。当然，关于我与NFL的关系以及那种事情的潜在结果，那确实有一段时间有点棘手。但总的来说，我对菲尔以及他接受收购一支球队这个想法的程度赞不绝口。现在他显然至今仍想成为耐克和NFL的一部分，这本应如此。但当事情该做的时候，你可以两者兼顾。球队，联盟。

<p class="english-text">We just did the deal with the stadium. Now, as Charlotte said, she Niked the stadium. We made that stadium look like it was Nike headquarters out there, but we didn't do it with the team. We basically brought the team out in no colors and no sponsor at all. But when we got to New York, we were playing the Giants. And that's when we made this announcement. And at that time, when we walked out on the field, I had a suit on, but I had the Nike tennis shoes on and Phil walked out with me and I had the Nike hat on. And we had met earlier with Al Michaels, and we had met with Dan Dierdorf and we had met in the dressing room. And I explained to them what this was about and where the edge was regarding the NFL and where it was regarding Nike and the Cowboys that made it a contentious thing. I'll never forget Al Michael said, now we may have, if we have a close game here, we might not get much to this in the second half. Well, we had quite a lead the Cowboys did going into half time, so they spent that entire half talking about this relationship and the NFL and what might might occur. That next morning Phil called me and he said, I have never had such a bang for my buck in you're life when he called. And I'll tell you from that time on, I could walk down the streets in New York, I could be in Chicago, and you'd have drivers in cars and what have you, just point to Nike and say, go get 'em. So the controversy, the controversy, if you will,</p>

And of course the potential result relative to my relationship with the NFL and that type thing, that got a little touchy there for a little while. But in general, I can't say enough about Phil and his buying into the idea of taking a team. Now he obviously to this day, wants to be a part of Nike and the NFL and it's as it should be. But when it's the thing to do, you can do both. Team, League.</p>
</details>

主持人: 没错。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's right.</p>
</details>

Jerry Jones: 接受你所说的一切。我相信它。然而当时的总裁保罗·塔利亚布（Paul Tagliabue）却说：“琼斯在那边做什么？我们已经有这笔交易了。他凭什么认为他可以去这样做？”你当时心里有这个想法吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Take everything you say. And, and I believe it. And yet Paul Tagliabue, the commissioner at the time was like, what's Jones doing down there? We, we've got this deal. What, what makes him think that he can, he can go and do this? Did you have that in your mind?</p>
</details>

Jerry Jones: 嗯，我过去和现在都对保罗·塔利亚布怀有全世界的敬意，但我当时是在用不同的“燃料”运作。我拥有最终的权力，他们必须通过我。如果牛仔队在财务上没有更大意义，那么我的屁股就会被踢到街上。坦率地说，如果牛仔队出了问题，NFL的其他球队也很有可能出问题。所以我没有看到一个解决方案能让我排队、同步，与当时的其他29支、30支球队保持一致。我也没有找到那个答案，因为我没有找到那样做的答案。所以坦率地说，这并不舒服。我不会说这很舒服，但想到我正在为问题做些事情，以及我做这件事的方式，这让我很受启发。也许对每个人都适用，也许不适用。首先，我关心它对牛仔队有什么好处。我很清楚，我提出的一些受到批评的建议，都是为了牛仔队的最佳利益。我真的认为它们也符合NFL的最佳利益。我认为全国各地的俱乐部和它们所在的巨大市场，它们拥有无限的能力来推广自己的品牌，并在产品或服务中以富有想象力的方式吸引球迷。我认为它们有能力比在一个中心地点做得更多。但另一方面，我认为NFL作为一个整体，拥有大量绝佳的资源来吸引公司和服务。他们确实做得很好，这被称为超级碗（Super Bowl）。这被称为比赛本身。所以想象一下，如果你愿意，有一个圈子，里面有所有的俱乐部，然后是NFL。嗯，我可以看到每个俱乐部在各自的营销领域，与耐克达成协议。然后我可以看到NFL与耐克达成协议，是的。但也许是与一个竞争对手，这才是它的根本所在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I had, and have all the respect in the world for Paul Tagliabue, but I was operating on different gasoline. I had the ultimate, they had to come through me. It was my fanny that was gonna get put out on the street if the Cowboys didn't make more sense financially. And if something happened to the Cowboys, frankly it had a good chance of happening to others in the NFL other teams in the NFL. And so I didn't see a solution to get in line, get in sync, get right in with the other, at that time, 29 teams, 30 teams. I didn't see that answer either because I hadn't found that answer to do that. And so candidly, it wasn't comfortable. I'm not gonna say it's comfortable, but it was inspirational to think that I was doing something about the problem. And the way that I was doing something about it. Maybe for everybody, maybe not. First, I was interested in what it did for the Cowboys. And I knew good and well, some of the things I was suggesting that I was getting criticized for were in the best interest of the Cowboys. And I really thought they were in the best interest of the NFL. I think the clubs and the great markets they're in around this country, they have all of the ability in the world to promote their brands and to be imaginative in terms of, of involving fans in products or services. And I think they have the ability to get involved more than you do at one central place. But on the other hand, I thought the NFL as a whole had a fabulous inventory of things to engage companies and services. And they do very much, it's called Super Bowl. It's called the game itself. And so picture, if you will, a circle that's got all of the clubs in it and then you have the NFL. Well, I could see each club in their areas of marketing and making their deal with Nike. And then I could see the NFL having a deal if Nike Yes. But maybe with an a competing, competing entity that fundamentally was what it was all about.</p>
</details>

主持人: 对。因为我的意思是，本质上发生的事情，你知道，对于那些不太熟悉的人来说，他们起诉你。你反诉。我的意思是，这很有争议。它变得非常具有争议性。它变得诉讼缠身。你当时知道这最终会如何解决吗？你知道会有一场斗争吗？

<p class="english-text">Right. Because I mean, essentially what happens, you know, for those who aren't as familiar with it, is they sue you. You counter sue. I mean it contentious. It, it goes, it, it gets real contentious. It gets litigious. Did you know that that was how this was ultimately gonna get settled? You knew there would be a fight?</p>
</details>

Jerry Jones: 嗯，首先，坦率地说，我没有其他方式去思考它，联盟立即起诉我的金额，他们拥有牛仔队。

<p class="english-text">Well, first of all, frankly, and I had no other way to think about it, the amount the league sued me for immediately they owned the Cowboys</p>

<p class="english-text">300 million, right.</p>

Jerry Jones: 当时是3亿美元。我告诉过你我把所有的钱都花光了，没有了，最终的数字是用来买牛仔队的。所以对我来说，那是一段戏剧性的、创伤性的经历，但它确实让我成长，如果你愿意，让我振作起来，少睡觉，但更敏锐。这是一次我认为我们将其作为平台，在多年过去后，我们从中受益匪多的经历，不仅仅是赞助领域的一剂强心针。顺便说一句，我买牛仔队时并不知道这些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">$300 million at the time. And I told you that I'd spent it all and didn't have, the ultimate figure was to buy the Cowboys. And so it was dramatic for me and traumatic for me, but caused me to certainly grow, if you will, buck up, sleep less, but sharpen up. And it was an experience that I think we used as a platform again for in years, as years have gone by and really have benefited from that more ways than just a shot of juice for the sponsorship area. I didn't know that buying the Cowboys by the way.</p>
</details>

Jerry Jones: 我根本没有看到那一点。我确实看到并说：“看，我必须找到一些东西，否则我将终生背负数百万美元的**亏损领头羊**（Loss Leader: 指以低于成本的价格出售商品或服务，以吸引顾客购买其他利润更高的商品或服务）。”所以我需要找到一些东西来与牛仔队联系起来，帮助我支付拥有牛仔队的账单和费用。

### 家族企业与传承

主持人: 杰里，大约三四年前，我们坐在牛仔队的一场比赛中。你对我说：“亚历克斯，我大概七十九、八十岁了，但我今天的工作比我三十九或四十九岁时还要努力。”你的职业道德从何而来？因为你一点都没有放慢脚步，这令人惊叹。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Jerry, we were sitting at a game at a Cowboy game maybe three, four years ago. And you said to me, Alex, I'm around seventy nine, maybe eighty, and I work harder today than I when I was thirty nine or forty nine. Where do you get that work ethic from? 'Cause it's remarkable you haven't slowed down one bit.</p>
</details>

Jerry Jones: 嗯，首先，我们之前谈过，当你买下球队时，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, first of all, we were talking earlier and when you bought the team,</p>
</details>

Alex Rodriguez: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah</p>

Jerry Jones: 你五十岁。如果你能从五十岁到我现在的年龄，如果你能拥有我过去三十年乐趣的10%，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You were fifty. If you could possibly from fifty to my age today, if you could have 10% of the fun that I've had over the last thirty years,</p>

<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, take five of it.</p>
</details>

Jerry Jones: 我向你保证，自从接触体育和达拉斯牛仔队以来，生活是无法衡量的。但它给了我如此鼓舞人心的基础，以至于我做了一些事情，而且这些事情不一定与牛仔队直接相关。这个故事的寓意是，如果你有一个梦想，或者你对某事充满激情，那么请在整合你的资产去实现它时，给予你的激情极大的价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I promise you there's no way to measure what life has been since touching sport and touching the Dallas Cowboys. But it's given me such an inspirational base that it's caused me to do things and, and really things that aren't necessarily directly associated at all with the Cowboys. And the moral of the story, the lesson is if you've got a dream or if you've got something that you're passionate about, boy give your passion a whole lot of value in terms of putting your assets together to go do it.</p>
</details>

主持人: 杰里，就这一点而言，对于我们这些在过去十年、十五年、二十年，尤其是最近五到十年更密切关注你的人来说，我们看到的是一个非常适应风险、非常适应争议的人。回顾你的整个历史，这一点变得很清楚，这是一种特质，而不是一个缺陷。这就是你。是什么让你对风险如此适应，因为你似乎在寻找它，你奔向它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so Jerry, to that point, you know, for those of us who, who've watched you more closely over the past, call it ten, fifteen, twenty years, certainly the last five or ten, we see someone who is very comfortable with risk, very comfortable with controversy. What becomes clear in watching your whole history is this is a feature, not a bug. This, this is, this is who you are. What gives you such comfort with risk because you seek it out, you, you run toward it, it feels like.</p>
</details>

Jerry Jones: 是的。嗯，我认为这种经验，如果你承担过风险，那么你肯定也失败过。我认为最重要的是处理失败的能力，并提出问题：“好吧，当你一个月后醒来，一切都对你不利时，看看你的人际关系，看看你生活中所追求的，你现在能接受那种不成功的感觉吗？”正是那种考验，那种第二天、下周的考验，你能坚持下去吗？如果你能做到，那么你就会回到那里说：“好吧，我现在必须做什么？”以及在财务上，你必须做的工作才能把它整合起来。我一直能做的一件事就是借到比我应该借的更多的钱。我在这方面很擅长。当我年轻得多，刚大学毕业时，这让我陷入困境。所以我真的从未见过我认为我无法找到财务方法实现的事情。从未。现在，我脑海中也有这些“蜘蛛网”，如果你剖开我，你会发现里面都是那些我无法支付账单的时刻。当我第一次参与牛仔队时，坦率地说，这个领域非常消极。有一位记者走过来，我们第一年赢了一场橄榄球比赛，记者问我：“这一定是你人生中最糟糕的日子吧？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Well I, I think that the experience, if you've taken risks, then certainly you have failed. I think as much as anything, it's the ability to deal with the failure and ask the question, okay, when you get up a month from now and it's gone totally the other way for you, look around at your relationships, look around at what you're about in life now, can you live with how that's going to feel when it didn't work? It's that test, it's that next day test, that next week test, Can you go? If you can do that, then you go back over there and say, okay, now what do I have to do? And financially what the work you have to do to put it together. The one thing I've always been able to do is borrow more money than I should have. And I'm real good at it. And it crippled me when I was much younger just getting outta college. So I've really never seen something that I didn't think that I could figure out a way to financially make it, make it happen. Ever. Now what I also though have in these cobwebs back there, and if you're ever cut me open, that's what you've got in there is all of those times when I couldn't pay. When I first got involved with the Cowboys, it was pretty frankly very negative in this area. And I had a reporter come up and we won one football game our first year and the reporter asked me, he said, these have gotta be the lowest days of your life.</p>
</details>

Jerry Jones: 我说：“在我买牛仔队大约15年前，我来到当时的爱田机场（Love Field），达拉斯的这个机场。我走到一个小摊位，那是一个租车摊位，以今天的标准来看很小，我拿出我的卡说我需要租一辆车在这里工作。他们查看了一份清单，当着我的面把我的卡剪成了两半，他们说：‘年轻人，你需要学会如何支付账单。你没有任何信用。’那才是达拉斯最艰难的一天。而不是一年只赢一场橄榄球比赛。那些才是最艰难的日子。所以，再次强调，不要过分强调这一点，我们正在谈论的，是对体育的兴趣的延伸，当然还有我参与的那些年，当它在财务上不太顺利的时候，现在我们最近在如何让它在财务上运作良好方面做得不错。我们看到那里的潜力比我们想象的要大。我当时不一定看到这一点。我真的没有。我很快就发现它就在那里。所以回过头来看，似乎，嗯，你知道，那应该会成功，如果现在你坐在那里，社交媒体和所有的关注都在那里，你应该能够找到一种方法将这种亲和力附加到产品或服务上。你应该能够做到这一点。嗯，我们当时没有做到，对我来说，今天它就在那里，而且比以往任何时候都更在那里。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I said, about 15 years before I bought the Cowboys, I came in Love Field at that time, the airport here in Dallas. And I went up to a little stand, it was a Rent a car stand, small by today's standards, put my card out there and said I need to rent a car for my work down here. They looked down a list, took my card right in front of me and just cut it in two, they said, young man, you need to know how to learn how to pay your bills. You don't have any credit. That's a hard day in Dallas, Texas. Not just winning one football game all year long. Those are the hard days right there. And so again, not to overemphasize the point, the thing we're talking about, the interest in extending the interest in sport and certainly the years I've been involved when it didn't quite work financially, now we're doing some good lately about how to make it work financially. And that we're seeing that is more there than we might have thought were there. I didn't necessarily see that. I really didn't. I found it out pretty quick that it was, it was there. So looking back seems like, well, you know, that ought to have work that should have, if you're sitting out here now, social media and all of the eyeballs there, you ought to be able to figure out a way to attach that affinity to a product or a service. You should be able to do that. Well we hadn't done that and to me that's there today and it's there more so than it's ever been.</p>
</details>

主持人: 嗯，杰里，有一件事，正如你所说的，关于体育的价值和球队的价值，已经变得非常明显。**私募股权**（Private Equity: 指通过非公开方式募集资金，对企业进行股权投资，以期获得高额回报的一种投资形式）进入体育界，特别是**NFL**，对联盟来说是一个里程碑式的时刻。你如何看待私募股权在联盟中的表现？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, and one of the things that, to your exact point Jerry, around the, the value of sports and the value of teams that has become very apparent. Private equity coming into sports and specifically the National Football League has been a, a seminal moment for the league. What do you make of private equity so far in the league?</p>
</details>

Jerry Jones: 我认为，首先，让我澄清一下。我是个**普通大众**（Main Street guy: 指关注实体经济、社区和日常商业活动的人），不是**华尔街精英**（Wall Street guy: 指关注金融市场、投资和大型企业交易的人）。我是在一个以客户为核心的家庭中长大的。那种“客户永远是对的”处理事情的方式。最重要的是要建立你的关键联系。那可以是产品、服务、公司。它也可能是那些投资者。我称他们为少数投资者。虽然我不接受少数投资者，但我不想那样说一个投资者。任何想在球队投入几十万或一百万美元的人，我希望他们能像我一样，坦率地认为自己有权完成这件事。我希望那样对待他们。我希望他们走出去时，如果他们来到这里，我希望他们认为自己是这支球队的一部分，因为他们确实是，他们至关重要。你告诉我任何一家拥有大量资本来源的企业，它们难道没有很多活力和很多成功吗？所以今天的体育界正在获得真正的资本来源，就像其他投资一样。而这些资本来源的一部分，不是一些股息支票，也不是墙上的一些奖牌。它的一部分是参与其中，成为球队的一部分。我认为这至关重要。我曾让一些人参与到我们的球队——牛仔队中，不是直接拥有所有权，而是作为有价值的赞助商。比方说一个啤酒赞助商，那就像是杰里·琼斯早上六点在仓库地板上。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I think that, first of all, let me clear this up. I'm a Main street guy, not a Wall Street guy. I was raised with a family. That was the, the, the heart of the customer. The customer is right that approach to things. The thing that is so important is to take your critical associations. And that can be products, service, companies. It can possibly be those very investors. I'm gonna call them minority investors. Although I don't accept a minority investor, I don't want to say that about an investor. Anybody that wants to put hundreds of thousands or a million dollars in the team, boy I want 'em to be just as entitled frankly as I feel about it to get that done. And I want to treat 'em that way. And I want 'em to think that when they walk out here, if they come out here, I want 'em to think they're a part of this team because they are, they're critical. Name me any business that when they have great capital sources, don't really have a lot of energy and a lot of success. And so sports today is getting real capital sources as other investments would. And that capital resources, a part of that is not some dividend check, are not some plaque on the wall. A part of that is being involved and getting to be a part of the team. I think that's critical. I've had people involved in our team, the Cowboys, not a direct ownership, but as a valued sponsor And let's say a beer sponsor, well that's Jerry Jones out at the floor of that warehouse at six in the morning.</p>

Jerry Jones: 你会认为，我正在中场休息时和橄榄球队讲话。相反，我正在和司机们讲话，我告诉司机们，当他们去7-Eleven时，要和经理谈谈**产品植入**（Product Placement: 指将品牌或产品融入电影、电视节目、视频游戏等媒体内容中，以达到宣传效果），并将其放置在更多人会购买啤酒的地方。我正在向他们解释这些。因此，我同样关心牛仔队如何帮助他们实现他们的目标，就像他们关心牛仔队一样。所以这和某些人可能认为的，作为基金或其他形式的投资关系并不完全一样。成为体育界的老板有更多内涵。而且它可能非常值得。

<p class="english-text">And you'd think, I was talking to the football team at halftime. Instead I'm talking to the drivers and I'm talking to the drivers about how when they go in at 7-Eleven, talk to the manager about product placement and putting it to where more people will buy the beer. I'm explaining that to them. So consequently, I'm as interested in the Cowboys helping them be what they want to be as they are and being interested in the Cowboys. So that's not exactly the relationship that somebody might think if they were sitting there as an investment in a fund or something like that. There's more to being an owner in sports. And it can be, and it can be very rewarding.</p>
</details>

Alex Rodriguez: 你在那个电话里告诉了我，你说：“亚历克斯，必须是你。你必须是首席营销官，首席营收官。必须是你，而不是你雇用的任何人。他们想见到你，你将为那支球队打开大门，必须是你。”你说了大概三次。你说：“别忘了这一点。”

<p class="english-text">You told me that in that phone call and you said, Alex, it has to be you. You gotta be the chief marketing officer, the chief revenue officer. It's gotta be you, not anyone you hire. They wanna see you and you're gonna open doors for that team and it's gotta be you. You said it like three times. You said, don't forget that.</p>
</details>

主持人: 杰里，你把这支球队作为你的家族企业一直保留着，我想肯定有人敲你的门，特别是现在这些新批准的私募股权公司。他们很想收购牛仔队的股份。你会考虑吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Jerry, would you, you know, you have held onto this as your family business for all I, I have to think you've got people knocking on your door, especially with these newly approved private equity firms. They'd love to buy a stake in the Cowboys. Would you consider that?</p>
</details>

Jerry Jones: 嗯，我知道我曾问过一个人，他叫唐·泰森（Don Tyson），是泰森鸡肉（Tyson's Chicken）的老板。他是我很好的朋友。他和我一起看了两届超级碗。但当我收购牛仔队时，我住在阿肯色州，我问唐他是否愿意和我一起收购牛仔队。唐说他几个月后要收购霍利农场（Holly Farms）。所以，他说我不太像你那样热衷于体育。所以他说他不会做。但他说：“杰里，你有可能自己做吗？”我说：“嗯，是的，但我之所以和你谈，是因为有你作为合伙人会更舒服，更容易。”他说：“如果你能没有合伙人就做到这一点，那么你就应该去做，因为合伙人很昂贵。”这可能是从多数所有者的角度来看的。嗯，当然他们很昂贵，他们是你的合伙人。他们拥有球队就像你拥有它一样。他们应该参与其中，被包括在内，而不是某种虚构的东西，而是真正参与其中。坦率地说，我对我们的主要赞助商也有同样的感觉。对我来说，这就是投入。现在你我都清楚，不是所有老板都像乔治·斯坦布伦纳那样投入。不是所有人都像我这样投入。但坦率地说，如果你想让这件事对你，A-Rod，发挥出它应有的作用，那就是参与的方式。你最终得到的是一个几乎是你自己的家族，参与到牛仔队中。在我的具体案例中，我得以直接与我的家人一起经历这段旅程，结果是，他们已经不再是我们最初开始这段旅程时的人了。他们已经进化了，我们都一起进化了。我得到的功劳，大部分功劳都归功于他们的想法和执行。但我的重点是，这是一种旅程，也是一种参与。好消息是，我们可以站起来赢得冠军，所有这一切，所有这一切都让我想起了《教父》（The Godfather）。现在我将提供保护、金钱以及其他一切。告诉我为什么我值得拥有这一切。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I know that I asked one person, his name was Don Tyson of Tyson's Chicken. He's a great friend of mine. He sat with me at two Super Bowls. But when I bought the Cowboys and I lived in Arkansas, I asked Don if he'd like to join me in buying the Cowboys. And Don said I'm gonna buy Holly Farms here in a few months. And so, and I'm not quite into the sport thing like you are. So he said, I'm not gonna to do it. But he said, Jerry, is it possible for you to do it by yourself? And I said, well, yeah, but I'm talking to you because it'd be a lot more comfortable and a lot easier to have with you as a partner. He said, if you can do this without a partner, okay, you should do it because partners are expensive. That would be from the eyes of let's say the majority owner. Well of course they're expensive, they're your partners. They own the team like you own it. And they should be involved and be included and be made to not, not some kind of fictitious thing, but be made to be involved. And candidly, I feel that way about our key sponsors as well. To me that's wearing it. Now you and I both know all owners don't get involved like George Steinbrenner did. All of 'em don't get involved like I get involved. But candidly, if you want this thing to be what it can be for you, A-Rod, that is the way to engage. And what you've ended up with is a almost a a, a family of your own involved with the Cowboys. In my particular case, I've gotten to spend this journey directly with my family and as it's turned out, they have become not the ones we started the journey with. And they have, we have evolved, we've all evolved together. And I get credit for, most of the credit I get are their ideas and their execution. But my whole point is it is the journey and it is the being involved. And the good news is, is that we can step up there and win a championship, Have all of this, all of this reminds me of the Godfather now I'm gonna provide the protection, the money, and everything else. Tell me why I deserve this.</p>
</details>

主持人: 好交易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good deal.</p>
</details>

主持人: 杰里，当你谈到你的家人时，我听到你说的是，我希望你在这里保持诚实，这将是家族企业。你现在不寻找合作伙伴。这个说法公平吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so when you talk about your family, Jerry, what I hear you saying, and I want you to keep us honest here, is that this will be the family business. You're not looking for partners at this point. Is that a fair statement?</p>
</details>

Jerry Jones: 是的，我认为最好的表达方式是我之前暗示过的。我没有进行投资。我没有进行投资。我投资了一份工作，这就是为什么从一开始我就说我会以各种方式参与其中。我的孩子们在那些年通过我购买股份，并不是投资的一部分。我们收购了球队，但我们得到的是工作，我们得到了一份事业，你猜怎么着？我们得到了一种生活。我无法告诉你最值得的事情当然是与他们一起工作，并让他们也参与其中。所以在这些情况下，因为他们已经为牛仔队工作了一辈子，我看不出这会改变。当然，这里没有继任计划，因为他们一直在做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, and I think the best way to make my point is that I alluded to it earlier. I didn't make an investment. I did not make an investment. I invested in a job and that's why from the very get go, I said I was gonna be involved in every way. My children buying through me back in those years were not a part of an investment. We bought the team, but what we got were jobs and we got a career and guess what? We got a life. And I can't tell you what the most rewarding thing of course has been really working with them and having them involved as well. So under those circumstances, because, they've spent a lifetime working with the Cowboys, I don't see that changing. And of course there's no succession plan here because they've been doing it anyway.</p>
</details>

主持人: 所以我想象的是，为了更明确地说，人们肯定会敲你的门，想要投资牛仔队。而你只是说：“不，谢谢。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so what I would imagine, just to put a fine point on it, people must knock on your door wanting to invest in the Cowboys. And you just say, no thank you.</p>
</details>

Jerry Jones: 嗯，坦率地说，我有很多绝佳的机会。是的。几乎从我收购俱乐部的那一刻起，就有了合伙人。事实上，第二天早上，在我们宣布将收购球队并进行改革之后，我接到了邦·布莱特（Bum Bright）的电话，是他把球队卖给了我。他说：“我刚接到一个电话，来自你所能想象到的最合格的人。他们说他们在那儿，他们看到了我所在的地方，我们握了手或者我们得到了什么。他们说要告诉你，无论我们签的纸上写了什么，虽然不多，他们都会接受，给你1000万美元，让你那天早上回家去阿肯色州。”我说：“布莱特先生，我说，告诉他们谢谢他们的提议，但不用了，我现在已经投入到这件事中了。我们会继续下去。”但底线是，所花费的时间、承诺、参与，它真的不是工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I've had wonderful opportunities, frankly yes. To have partners almost, almost from the time I bought the club. As a matter of fact, the next morning I got up after we had had a, our announcement that we were gonna buy the team and make the changes. I get a call from Bum Bright who had sold me the team and he said, I just got a call from probably the most qualified people you could ever imagine. And said they were there, they've seen where I was, had a handshake or whatever we got. And they said to tell you that you can, whatever's on the piece of paper we sign, which wasn't much, they'll take it, give you $10 million to go home to Arkansas that morning. I said, Mr. Bright, I said, tell 'em that's thanks for their offer, but no, I'm on this thing now. And we we're going with it. But the bottom line is that the time spent, the commitment, the being involved, it, it really hadn't been work.</p>
</details>

主持人: 对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right.</p>
</details>

Jerry Jones: 有些担忧，有些非常非常严重的“万一”。主要是早期的财务问题，非常早期的财务问题，我真的可以预见到灾难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Been some worry now, been some serious, serious what ifs. Principally early financial, very early financial, I could really have envisioned disaster.</p>
</details>

Jerry Jones: 坦率地说，我当时已经到了一个地步，我不应该冒那个险，尤其是在我经历过并且更清楚之后，不应该拿我的家人去冒险。但我还是做了，因为我想参与其中。但我非常清楚，这就像在清醒的时候接受一点手术。我一直非常清楚，如果不得不离开达拉斯，离开牛仔队，或者剩下的一切，那会是多么尴尬的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And frankly I had gotten to a point to where I shouldn't have risked that regarding my family, especially after what I'd been through and knew better. But I did it because I wanted to be involved. But I was very aware, it's like being operated on a little bit while you're still awake. I was very aware the whole time of how an embarrassing thing it would be to have to leave Dallas and leave the Cowboys here or the whatever's left of it.</p>
</details>

主持人: 对。所以你的继任计划基本上是，你说没有继任计划，但继任计划是你的孩子们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. And so your succession plan is essentially, you said there's no succession plan, but the succession plan is your kids.</p>

### 快速问答与人生哲学

主持人: 我们很快就要进入闪电问答环节了。但有一件事让我很受触动，你知道，坐在这里和你们两位“比生命更伟大”的人物（如果我可以说我搭档的话）在一起，以及那些在你们职业生涯中，从球员时代到现在，从头到尾都不得不应对各种批评的人物。你有什么建议来屏蔽噪音？你每天都会在报纸上、社交媒体上，史蒂芬·A·史密斯（Stephen A. Smith）或其他任何人，收到很多批评，或者他们对你喋喋不休。你的秘诀是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're gonna get to our, our lightning round in a second. But, but there's one thing that just sort of strikes me, you know, sitting here with, with both of who are larger than life characters, if I can say this at about my partner and and characters who have had to deal with a lot of stuff coming at you over the course of your careers from when you were a player to now from all, all through your ownership. What's your advice for blocking out the noise? You get a lot of criticism every day in the paper, every day on social media. Stephen A. Smith, whoever it is fussing at you or fuss, fussing about you, what's your secret?</p>
</details>

Jerry Jones: 嗯，首先，体育给了你这样一个空间，你知道你会受到批评。你有时会在关键时刻出局。而我们鼓励的正是球迷对它的兴趣。球迷们坐在那里发表意见，他们对我们是否按照他们的方式做了，或者他们的期望是什么，发表意见。这就是它的基础。它是如此真实。所以你生活在其中。当然，我想我不应该为此感到自豪，但我不知道有几个人在过去三五年、四十年里比我受到更多的批评。但我从未以任何方式怨恨过。事实上，我想要解决它，并成为它的一部分。有时我认为这里可能有些问题。我似乎在他们批评我的时候表现得更好，而不是在我没有受到批评的时候。但体育让你能够做到这一点，它确实让你能够向他们展示，它让你在内心拥有一个特定的位置。你永远是团队的一部分，但在你内心深处，它让你能够想象回来并向他们展示。我们刚刚和米卡·帕森斯（Michah Parsons）做了一笔交易。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well first of all, sports gives you such a, a space entering at, you know, that you're gonna have criticism. You strike out and you strike out at critical times sometimes. And the very thing that we encourage is fans' interest in that. And fans sitting there with opinions and their opinions about whether or not we did it the way they would've done it or what their expectation was. That's what it's based on. And it's so authentic. And so you live in that. And certainly I, I don't guess I should be proud of it, but I don't, I don't know of many that have had more criticism than I've had over the last thirty five, forty years to be involved. But I've never ever resented that in any way. As a matter of fact, I, I wanna address it and wanna be a part of it. Sometimes I think that there may be something wrong here. I seem to do better when they're criticizing me than than when I'm not. But sports allows you to do that now it really does allow you to show 'em and it allows you to have a certain place within yourself. You're part of a team always, but within yourself it allows you to imagine coming back and showing them. We just made a trade on Michah Parsons.</p>
</details>

主持人: 真的吗？我错过了。不，我开玩笑的。但我们刚刚和米卡·帕森斯做了一笔交易。当然，我想展示我们可以成功地利用这笔交易给达拉斯牛仔队带来的结果。你能想象吗，我仍然坐在这里努力奋斗，我记得去年，或者说我们经历了一场让我非常沮丧的失利。所以我知道你应该列出那个清单。那是本·富兰克林（Ben Franklin）的旧清单，左边列出你所有伟大的事情，右边列出所有正在发生的负面事情，这在那种情况下当然是当务之急。嗯，我想让你知道，有时我必须列出我做对的事情。我必须用五种不同的方式列出五次，才能让我的清单更长。但我总是带着积极的清单离开那里，很高兴今天能打球。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Really? I missed that. No I'm just kidding. But we just made a trade with Michah Parsons. Well of course I want to show that we can be successful with the result of what that brings to the Dallas Cowboys that's going to bat. Can you imagine, I'm still sitting here going to bat, I remember last year after, or we had a, a loss that really had me down. And so I know that you're supposed to make that list. It's the old Ben Franklin list where on the left side you list all of the things that you've got that are great and on the right side you list all of the negatives that are going on, which would certainly be the order of the day in that circumstances. Well I want you to know that sometimes I have to list my things that I do right. I have to list it about five times in five different ways to make my list longer. But I always come out of there with a positive list glad to be playing ball today.</p>

Jerry Jones: 你知道，我认为明尼苏达维京人队（Minnesota Vikings），当雷德·麦库姆斯（Red McCombs）收购他们时，我认为那就像是在一个价值50万美元的街区里，买了一栋5万美元的房子。我想，如果能以某种方式让家人或朋友参与其中。当然，他们最终拥有了一些很棒的所有权。但对我来说，那是我当时在体育界见过的最好的交易，可以说。

<details>

<p class="english-text">You know, I thought the Minnesota Vikings, when Red McCombs bought 'em, I thought that was the equivalent of not far back, but that was like buying a $50,000 house on a $500,000 block full of houses. I thought if there's any way to involve that with a family or a friend. And of course they've ended up with some great ownership. But that was for me at that time, the best deal I'd seen on the street, so to speak, in sport.</p>
