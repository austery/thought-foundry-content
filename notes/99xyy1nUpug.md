### 房产与财富积累

**[发言人]**: 如果你在二三十岁时没有进入**房屋所有权**的游戏，一直租房，那么到了四十岁，你会发现自己没有任何净资产。事实上，美国的房主比租房者富有**40倍**。我指的是普通美国人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: If you don't get in the game of home ownership and you rent in your 20s and you rent in your 30s, you're going to turn around in your 40s and having not built any net worth. And in fact, homeowners in America are worth 40 times more than renters. And I'm talking about ordinary Americans.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 但这不意味着买房让他们变得富有，对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: But that doesn't mean that buying a home made them rich, right?

</details>

**[发言人]**: 实际上是的，我将详细解释这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: It actually does. And I'm going to go through that.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 难道我租房然后投资**股市**不是更好吗？我想打破这个神话，因为我过去**33年**的人生都在帮助数百万普通收入的人实现**财务自由**，其中包括在**摩根士丹利（Morgan Stanley）**担任了九年的财务顾问。我亲眼看到每个来到我办公室的普通收入者是如何积累财富的。致富有一个公式，但也有一个系统，让你在不到**10分钟**内将财务生活自动化。这不需要纪律，不需要预算，你也不需要赚很多钱才能开始。但除非你的财务计划是自动化的，否则它会失败。更重要的是，我相信未来十年将是我们一生中积累财富的最佳机会。然而，现在有**70%**的人是月光族，超过**50%**的美国人没有储蓄，大多数人不知道自己的钱花到哪里去了。事实上，当我们问人们，需要多少钱才能彻底改变他们的生活时，他们说**1万美元**。那么，你每天需要花多少钱才能每年挥霍**1万美元**呢？每天**27.40美元**。如果你每天投资这些钱，坚持**40年**，你将拥有超过**442.4万美元**。那将是改变人生的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: But am I not better off renting and investing in the stock market? I want to bust this myth because I have spent the last 33 years of my life helping millions of people with ordinary incomes become financially free, including nine years as a financial adviser at **Morgan Stanley** and I got to see firsthand how everyone who came into my office with an ordinary income built wealth. And there's a formula to getting rich, but there's also a system to how you put your financial life on autopilot in less than 10 minutes. And it doesn't require discipline, budget, and you don't have to make a lot of money to get started. But unless your financial plan is automatic, it will fail. But more importantly, I believe the next 10 years will be the greatest opportunity to build wealth in our lifetime. And yet, 7 out of 10 people right now are living paycheck to paycheck. More than 50% of Americans don't have savings. And most people don't know where their money goes. And in fact, when we ask people, how much money would it take to totally change your life? They say $10,000. Now, how much money do you need to spend a day to blow $10,000 a year? $27.40 a day. If you invested that a day for 40 years, you'd have over $4,424,000. That would be life-changing.

**[主持人]**: 在我们深入探讨所有具体细节和策略之前，对于目前正为债务所困的人，你有什么具体的建议吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: But just before we get into all of the specifics and the strategies, do you have any specific advice to people that are currently struggled with debt?

</details>

**[发言人]**: 当然。有一个非常简单的摆脱债务的公式，叫做**DOLP**。我会告诉你…

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Absolutely. There's a very simple formula to getting out of debt called dole. I'd tell you to

</details>

**[发言人]**: 我过去**30年**的人生都在帮助普通人，帮助普通收入的人实现**财务自由**。过去**20年**，我一直在帮助人们成为**自动百万富翁**。所以，我喜欢教导任何收入水平的人，无论是最低工资，还是月光族。你可能负债累累，可能正在挣扎。我教过数百万人如何改善他们的财务生活。这就是我一直致力于的事情。我在金融服务行业总共工作了**33年**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: I have spent the last 30 years of my life helping ordinary people, people with ordinary incomes become financially free. And the last 20 years I've spent helping people become automatic millionaires. So, I love to teach anyone at any income level, minimum wage, living paycheck to paycheck. You might be in debt. You might be struggling. I've taught millions of people how they can improve their life financially. That's what I've been dedicated to. And I spent 33 years total in the financial service industry.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 这次对话只适用于二三十岁的人，还是适用于所有年龄段的人？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: And is this conversation just for people that are in their 20s or is it applicable to everybody at every age?

</details>

**[发言人]**: 它适用于所有年龄段的人，因为无论你多大年纪，**Stephen**，现在这个国家有太多人是月光族。现在的情况是，**70%**的人在财务上被甩在后面。现在有**70%**的人是月光族。看看今天的美国财务状况，一半的美国人在紧急情况下拿不出**1000美元**。我最大的担忧，也是我更新这本书并决定再次出来进行一次**金融扫盲**宣传的原因，是我担心人们被甩在后面。我认为，在**人工智能（AI）**的时代，未来十年将是我们一生中积累财富的最佳机会。这是好消息。坏消息是很多人会被甩在后面。我今天，在接下来的一个小时里的目标非常简单。我想给你一个系统，让你在任何年龄、任何收入水平都能成为**自动百万富翁**。我将教你如何在不到**10分钟**内让你的财务生活自动化。因为当你的财务生活自动化时，你的习惯就会自动运作。而自动化的财务生活不需要纪律，不需要预算，你也不需要赚很多钱才能开始。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: It's applicable to everybody at every age because whatever your age is, it you know, look, Stephen, so many people are living paycheck to paycheck right now in this country. What's happening right now is that seven out of 10 people are being left behind financially. Seven out of 10 people right now are living paycheck to paycheck. When you go into looking at finances in America today, half of Americans can't get their hands on $1,000 in case emergency purposes. And my biggest fear, why I updated this book and why I decided to come back out one more time and do another financial literacy campaign is I'm afraid people are being left behind. I think with AI right now, the next 10 years is going to be the greatest opportunity to build wealth in our lifetime. That's the good news. The bad news is a lot of people being left behind. My goal today, next hour is very simple. I want to give you the system on how to become an automatic millionaire at any age level, at any income level. But what I'm going to teach you is how to put your financial life on autopilot in less than 10 minutes. Because when your financial life is automatic, your habits work automatically. And an automatic financial life doesn't require discipline, doesn't require a budget, and you don't have to make a lot of money to get started.

### 个人背景与理财理念

**[主持人]**: 人们为什么要听你在这个问题上的建议？你在这**33年**里做了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: Why should people be taking advice from you on this subject matter? What's what have you done in those 33 years?

</details>

**[发言人]**: 我这辈子都在做这件事。对吧？所以，如果你追溯到很久以前，我**7岁**就开始投资了。事情是这样的：我有一个了不起的祖母，她叫**Rose奶奶**。在她**30岁**的时候，她做了一个改变我们整个家族命运的决定。她决定不再贫穷。在她**30岁**生日那天，一个非常寒冷的日子，她对我的祖父说：“我们没有钱，我们是月光族，我不想在这里退休。我想去**加利福尼亚**，我想去温暖的地方。”我的祖父说：“那你想怎么办？”她说：“我们需要改变我们正在做的事情，否则什么都不会改变。”于是我的祖母开始每周从她的工资中存下**50美分**。因为他们是中产阶级，对吧？没有大学学历。我的祖父在工厂工作，我的祖母在零售业工作。但她开始存小笔钱。在她的一生中，她成了一名投资者，并成为了一位**白手起家的百万富翁**。我的第一本书，就是你放在那边的这本书，叫做《**Smart Women Finish Rich**》。那是我祖母教我的经验。所以，在我**7岁**的时候，我的祖母带我去**麦当劳**，她给我上了一堂改变我人生的课。她说：“**David**，你现在坐在这里吃**麦当劳**汉堡、薯条和奶昔。”她说：“我今天要教你如何真正致富。你喜欢玩**大富翁**，这是我今天的课。”她说：“有三种人。像你现在在这里吃饭的人，你被称为**消费者**。她说，那边那些一直在工作的人，他们被称为**雇员**，他们拿着最低工资工作，那是一种非常艰辛的生活方式。她说他们当时每小时赚**85美分**。她说第三种人是拥有这个地方的人，他们被称为**投资者**。她说：‘今天，我将教你如何购买**麦当劳**的股票，这样当你来**麦当劳**时，你就能从这里的每个人身上赚钱。当你的朋友来**麦当劳**时，你也能从他们身上赚钱，你将成为**麦当劳**的老板。’”然后她带我去了一家券商，帮我买了第一股**麦当劳**的股票。那一刻改变了我的人生，因为她让我意识到，我们所做的一切，我当时**7岁**，我们所做的一切，都有机会成为投资者并拥有它。所以，在我**9岁**的时候，我在**迪士尼**，我说：“嘿，**米老鼠**，你是上市公司吗？”所以我在那方面不是一个正常的孩子，因为我从小就开始投资。但我后来犯了很多错误。我上了大学，然后我背上了**信用卡债务**。我当时相信了年轻人常相信的所有神话。我以为我赚不到很多钱就不能真正投资很多。所以，在我二十出头的时候，我赚钱，但把所有钱都花光了。我从一无所有到年收入**5万美元**，但我仍然身无分文。我想，嗯，钱不够。所以我把收入提高到**7.5万美元**，仍然身无分文，花得更多。然后我年收入达到了**10万美元**。很多钱，对吧？在我二十多岁的时候。哦，天哪，我很有钱。不，那时候我花的仍然比赚的多。我当时是一名财务顾问。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: I've been doing this my entire life. Right? So, if you go all the way back, I started investing at the age of seven. And how that happened is I had a grandmother, amazing grandmother. Her name was **Grandma Rose**. At 30, she made a decision that changed the whole destiny of our family. And the decision she made was she want to be poor anymore. And at 30, on a very cold day on her birthday, she turned to my grandfather and she said, "We don't have any money. We're living paycheck to paycheck and I don't want to retire here. I want to go to California. I want to be where it's warm." And my grandfather said, "Well, what do you want to do about it?" and she's like, "We need to change what we're doing or nothing will change." And so my grandmother started saving 50 cents a week out of her paycheck. So 50 cents each because they were like middle class people, right? Didn't have a college education. My grandfather worked in a plant. My grandmother worked in retail. But she started saving small amounts of money. And over her lifetime, she became an investor. And she became a self-made millionaire. My first book, which you have sitting over here, was a book called **Smart Women Finish Rich**. It was the lessons that my grandmother taught me. So, at seven, my grandmother took me to **McDonald's** and she taught me a lesson that would change my life. She said, "**David**, you're sitting here eating **McDonald's** and cheeseburgers and your French fries and your milkshake." She said, "I'm going to teach you today how to be rich for real. You like to play **Monopoly**. Here's my lesson today." She said, "There's three types of people. those like you who are here eating right now, you're what's called a consumer. She said the people over there who have been working, they're called employees and they've been working for minimum wage and that's a very hard way to live. She said they make at the time they made 85 cents an hour. And she said the third type of person is the person who owns this place. They're called an investor. And she said, "Today, I'm going to teach you how to buy stock in **McDonald's** so that when you come to **McDonald's**, you'll make money from everybody who's here. When your friends come to **McDonald's**, you'll make money from them, and you'll be an owner of **McDonald's**." And she took me down to a brokerage firm, helped me buy my first share of stock at **McDonald's**. That moment changed my life because what she made me realize is like everything that we do, I'm seven years old. everything that we do, there's an opportunity to be an investor and own that. So like at nine years old, I'm at **Disney**. I'm like, "Hey, **Mickey Mouse**, are you public?" So I was like not a normal kid in that way because I started investing at a young age. But then I made a lot of mistakes. Then I went to college. Then I got myself in credit card debt. Then I believed all the myths that young people often believe. I believed I couldn't really invest a lot until I made a lot of money. So, in my early 20s, I was making money but spending everything. So, I was went from making nothing to making $50,000 a year and I'm still broke. I'm like, well, it's not enough money. So, I went to $75,000 a year, still broke, spending more. Then I got to $100,000 a year in income. Lot of money, right? In my 20s. Oh my god, I'm rich. No, I was still spending more than I was making at that point. I was a financial adviser and al

**[发言人]**: 那是我的工作。我在**摩根士丹利**工作，帮助人们规划退休，教授退休研讨会。我遇到了一对普通的夫妇，**Jim**和**Sue McIntyre**，他们**52岁**时来到我的办公室。他们有一份普通的工作。那一年，他们赚了**5.3万多美元**。他们一生的平均收入是**4万美元**。在**Jim 52岁**时，他把所有账单放在我面前的桌子上。我坐下来把它们加起来，他们的净资产是**180万美元**。我坐在这张桌子旁，就像现在这样，问：“你们是怎么做到的？”他们刚刚参加了我的课程四周。他们说：“**David**，我们做了很多你讲的事情，但我们没有预算，因为预算不起作用。”他们谈论了为什么预算对他们不起作用。他们说：“我们把所有事情都自动化了。我们自动为所有事情存钱。”那一刻改变了我的人生。那天我意识到，作为一个高收入的月光族，这些人只有我一半的收入，却能在**52岁**退休。我当时二十多岁，我意识到如果我不开始储蓄和投资，如果我不改变，什么都不会改变，我将永远无法拥有他们那样的**财务自由**。所以那天我回家，改变了我生活中的一切。我当时有很多坏习惯，所以有很多事情需要改变。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: that was my job. I was working at **Morgan Stanley** helping people plan for retirement teaching retirement seminars and I met this ordinary couple that came into my office at the age of 52, **Jim** and **Sue McIntyre**. They had an ordinary job. That year they had made a little over $53,000. Their average income over their lifetime was $40,000. And at 52, **Jim** put out all the statements on a table in front of me. I sat there and added them up and they had a net worth of $1.8 million. And I sat back at a table just like this and said, "How did you do this?" And they had just been in my class for four weeks. They're like, "**David**, we did a lot of what you talked about, but we didn't have a budget because budgets don't work." and they talked about why budgeting didn't work for them. They said, "We put everything on autopilot. We saved money automatically for everything." And that was the moment that changed my life. I realized that day as somebody who was living paycheck to paycheck with a high income. These people had half the income that I did and they were able to retire at 52. I was in my mid20s and I realized that if I didn't start saving and investing, if I didn't change, nothing was going to change and I would never have the financial freedom that they had. And so I went home that day and I changed everything in my life. Now I had a lot of bad habits. So I had a lot of things that needed to be changed.

### 女性与金钱：独特挑战与优势

**[主持人]**: 你在**摩根士丹利**担任高级副总裁时辞职，不久后写了这本名为《**Smart Women Finish Rich**》的书。这引出了一个问题：在你进行金融教育的过程中，你发现女性与男性在面对金钱时有哪些不同？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: You were the senior vice president at **Morgan Stanley** when you stepped down and you soon after wrote this book called **Smart Women Finish Rich**. It begs the question, what are the differences that you saw through your process of financial education that women face versus men?

</details>

**[发言人]**: 我开始和我父亲一起做生意，我们有很多年长的客户，我会一次又一次地参加与**寡妇**的会议。所以在我职业生涯的第一个月，我参加了三次与三位寡妇的会议，她们的丈夫都突然去世了。我父亲当时正在教这些女性如何阅读她们的券商报表，如何写支票，以及如何知道她们是否有足够的钱。我觉得这太疯狂了。在第三次约会时，我对父亲说：“爸，这是怎么回事？”他问：“你什么意思？”我说：“你正在教这些女性在她们丈夫刚去世时如何处理财务。”他说：“**David**，不是所有女性都像你祖母那样。你祖母是个特例。”我说：“爸，这太疯狂了。我要出去为女性和金钱开一堂课。”当我开始为女性和金钱授课时，我学到了以下几点。以下是女性在金钱方面与男性不同的地方。首先，女性比男性寿命更长，这意味着她们需要比男性更多的钱。当我最初写那本书时，美国女性丧偶的平均年龄是**57岁**，**Stephen**。现在是**59岁**。好吧。你做了所有关于长寿的节目。看起来每个人都长生不老，但事实并非如此。美国女性丧偶的平均年龄是**59岁**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: I started I was in business with my father and we had a lot of older clients and I would sit in on meetings one after another with widows. So in the first month of my career, I sat in three meetings with three widows where the husband had dropped dead suddenly. And my dad at the time was teaching these women how to read their brokerage statements, how to write checks, and how to know if they would have enough money. And I thought, "This is crazy." And I said to my dad for the third appointment, "Dad, what do you what what's going on here?" And he's like, "Well, what do you mean?" I go, "Well, you're teaching these women when their husband has just died how to handle their finances." And he said, "**David**, not all women are like your grandmother. Your grandmother was a rarity." And I said, "Dad, that's crazy. I'm going to go out and teach a class for women and money." And when I started teaching the class for women money, here's what I learned. Here are the things that make women different than men when it comes to money. Women, first of all, live longer than men, which means they need more money than men do. The average age of widowhood in America when I wrote that book originally was 57, **Stephen**. Now it's 59. Okay. You do all these shows on longevity. It seems like everybody's living forever. They're not. Okay. The average age of widowhood in America is 59 years old.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 当你说“丧偶”时，你是指女性成为寡妇的年龄。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: When you say widowhood, you mean the age in which a woman becomes a widow.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 完全正确。她们结婚了，然后失去了丈夫。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Exactly. They're married and they lose their husband.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: Okay.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 好的。所以，当这种情况发生时，女性在财务上往往会一无所有。第二点是，在离婚方面，女性比男性受到的伤害更大。影响女性的第三点是她们工作年限更短。我的意思是，这些只是统计现实。女性因为生育孩子而比男性工作年限更短。平均而言，少工作**7到11年**。这意味着进入**社会保障**、**退休账户**的钱更少，这会影响她们的收入，而且她们通常赚得更少。所以，我近**30年**来一直在教导的是，作为一名女性，我不在乎你的情况如何。我不在乎你是不是企业家。我不在乎你是不是全职妈妈。我不在乎你是不是嫁给了当地的银行行长。我不在乎你是已婚、单身、丧偶还是离婚。作为一名女性，你必须掌控自己的财务。句号。放下麦克风。讨论结束。你不能把自己的财务福祉委托给任何人。你必须自己负责。现在，我还要告诉你，**Stephen**，女性比男性是更好的投资者。她们比男性是更好的投资者，因为女性通常不像男性那样频繁交易，她们在投资前会做更多的研究，而且她们的表现更好。她们在长期投资方面比男性强得多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Okay. So, so women are often wiped out when that happens financially. Second thing is that women are hurt more than men when it comes to divorce. The third thing that affects women is that they work fewer years. I'm like, these are just the the the the statistical realities. Women work fewer years than men because they have children. So that's an average of somewhere between 7 to 11 years less. And that's less money going into social security, retirement accounts, and it affects their earnings and often they earn less. So what I have taught for third nearly 30 years now is as a woman, I don't care what your situation is. I don't care if you're an entrepreneur. I don't care if you're a stay-at-home mother. I don't care if you're married to local bank president. I don't care if you're married, singled, widowed, divorced. As a woman, you have to be in charge of your finances. Period. Drop the mic. End of discussion. You can't delegate your financial well-being to anyone else. You have to be in charge. Now, I will also tell you, Stephen, that women make better investors than men. They they make better investors than men because often women don't trade like men do and they are they do more research before they invest and their performance is better. They're way better long-term investing than men are.

### 投资理念：无聊即是美

**[主持人]**: 我以前听过一些统计数据，说男性是赌博成瘾者的主要群体。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: I heard some stats once upon a time that men are the majority of the gambling addicts.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 嗯，我确信他们是赌博成瘾者的主要群体。而且当你看看交易，因为交易已经变得非常普遍，但交易一直都存在。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Well, I'm sure they're the majority of the gambling addicts. And also when you look at trading because trading's become a very big thing, but trading's always been a thing.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 交易是指？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: Trading meaning

</details>

**[发言人]**: 交易，比如股票交易，买卖股票。现在是买卖**加密货币**，买卖期权。所有这些事情主要是男性在做，他们赚不到钱，因为大多数交易者日复一日、年复一年地亏钱。我教导的理念是：你的钱和你的投资应该**无聊**。你的生活应该**有趣**。你的投资应该**无聊**。如果有人在鸡尾酒会上谈论他们的投资，而且听起来很刺激，那肯定有问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: trading like trading stocks, buying and selling stocks. Now it's buying and selling cryptocurrency, buying and doing selling options. All these things are primarily men doing it and they don't make money because the bulk of people who trade lose money day in day out in year out. I teach a philosophy which is this. Your money and your investments should be boring. Your life should be interesting. Your investments should be boring. If someone's coming to a cocktail party talking about their investments and it's exciting, something's wrong with it.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 为什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: Why?

</details>

**[发言人]**: 因为在金钱方面，**性感**会让你破产。在财富方面，**无聊**才是美丽的。所以，即使是开车过来，我儿子也说：“爸，你为什么不交易**特斯拉**股票？”我说：“你知道我为什么不交易**特斯拉**股票吗？因为交易赚不到钱。你得弄清楚什么时候买，什么时候卖。我希望我的孩子们投资**指数基金**。我让我的客户投资**指数基金**。在金钱方面，**无聊**即是美。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Because sexy is how you go broke when it comes to money. Boring is beautiful when it becomes when it's about your wealth. So, even driving over here, my son was just like, "Dad, why aren't you trading **Tesla** stock?" I'm like, "You know why I'm not trading **Tesla** stock? Because you can't make money trading. You got to figure out when to buy, when to sell. I want my kids investing in index funds. I have my clients investing in index funds. Boring is beautiful when it comes to money.

### 个人经济与财富不平等

**[主持人]**: 在我们深入探讨具体细节和策略，以及你谈到的债务、信用卡、储蓄、摆脱债务以及如何致富和成为自动百万富翁之前，我们是否应该讨论一下与全球背景相关的问题？无论是财富不平等，还是月光族的人数，我想了解一下西方世界的财务财富状况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: Before we get into the real specifics and the tactical strategies and um we think about a bunch of the sort of things you said about debt and credit cards and saving and getting out of debt and how to become wealthy and an automatic millionaire. Is there anything we should discuss as it relates to the broader context of what's going on in the world? Whether it's wealth inequality, whether it's the amount of people that are living paycheck to paycheck, what I'm trying to get a picture on what the the state of financial wealth looks like in the Western world.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 是的。那么，让我们来谈谈，你知道，当人们谈论经济时。在我看来，最重要的经济是你的经济，也就是说，听众你的经济，你掌控的经济是你的。你无法控制利率会发生什么，地缘政治会发生什么，**人工智能**会发生什么。你唯一能控制的经济是你的。现在，问题是：你在工作吗？大多数情况下，答案是肯定的。普通人一生中将工作**9万小时**。所以，如果你是一个双收入家庭，你们两个人一生中将工作**9万到20万小时**。你们一生中将赚取数百万美元。问题是，在你的个人经济中，你会留下多少钱？对很多人来说，悲哀的是他们没有。我说大多数人都有我所说的“无计划”。钱进来，钱出去。他们说：“嗯，我不知道钱都去哪儿了。”我说：“那叫做无计划。”一个**自动百万富翁**，钱一进来，他们就有一个明确的计划，知道钱会去哪里。这始于**先支付自己**。自动地。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Yeah. Well, so let's talk, you know, when people talk about economies. Here's here's the economy that matters in my opinion. Your economy, meaning the person that's listening, the economy that you're in control of is yours. You're not in control over what's going to happen with interest rates, what's going to happen with geopolitical things, what's going to happen with AI. The only economy that you can control is yours. Now, here's the question. Are you working? Most cases, the answer is yes. The average person will work 90,000 hours over their lifetime. So, if you are a dual income household, you're going to work somewhere between 90 to 200,000 hours, the two of you, over your lifetime. You're going to actually make millions of dollars over your lifetime. The question is with your own economy, are you going to keep any of the money? And the sad thing for many people is that they're not. I I say most people have what I call a no plan. Money comes in, money goes out. And they say, "Well, I don't know where the money all went." And I go, "That's called a no plan." A person who's an automatic millionaire, the moment money comes in, they have a plan for exactly where it's going to go. And it starts with paying themselves first. automatically.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 很多人听了这些。如果我回顾我人生中仅仅**10多年前**，我当时会坐在这里听这场对话，背负着**7000英镑**的债务。我会想，天哪，我要成为百万富翁，那真是遥不可及，并非双关语。要成为百万富翁，我必须赚更多的钱。当时我在呼叫中心工作。那感觉太遥远了。我说，你知道，人们还在为养活孩子而挣扎，更别提成为百万富翁了。对普通人来说，这很遥远吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: A lot of people listen to this and if I go back if I go back just over 10 years in my life, I would have been sat listening to this conversation in £7,000 of debt. And I would have thought, God, like I'm becoming a millionaire, that's a that's a million miles away, no pun intended. I to become a millionaire, I'm going to have to earn so much more money. And at the time, I was working in call centers. It it would have just felt so far away. And I say, you know, people are struggling to feed their children, let alone become a millionaire. Is it far away for the average person?

</details>

**[发言人]**: 如果你不知道策略，那就很遥远。摆脱债务有策略，积累财富有策略，有一个系统。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: It's far away if you don't know the strategy. There's a strategy to getting out of debt. There's a strategy to building wealth. There's a system.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 其中有多少只是赚更多的钱？因为当我在我的节目中进行这些对话时，我认为一个令人惊讶的未触及的领域是，我们没有教人们如何变得更有价值，以便他们能赚更多的钱。很多时候都是关于**指数基金**或储蓄什么的。但其中有多少只是我需要获得市场上更有价值的技能？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: How much of it is just earning more money? Because when I have these conversations on my show, I think the surprisingly untouched territory is we don't teach people how to become more valuable so that they can earn more money. A lot of it's about like index funds or savings, whatever. But how much of it is just like I need to get higher valued skills in the market?

</details>

**[发言人]**: 我们知道，赚更多的钱并不能让你致富。所以，人们可以像我之前告诉你的那样，从**10万美元**，他们可以从**5万美元**到**10万美元**，但仍然身无分文。他们可以从**10万美元**到**20万美元**一年，但仍然身无分文。他们可以从**20万美元**到**30万美元**，但仍然身无分文。在美国，年收入**15万美元**的家庭中，有三分之一仍然身无分文。当你揭开幕布，问为什么会这样？嗯，我们知道物价上涨了，但我们也知道生活方式大幅升级，对吧？你周围的人赚更多的钱，然后你花更多的钱。现实是，这些手机就是为了让你把所有钱都花光而设计的，对吧？今天，有了算法，有了比以往任何时候都更好的技术，让你花更多的钱。没有人希望你只花一次钱。他们希望你一辈子都花钱，对吧？这是客户的**终身价值**。所以，我们的收入有一场争夺战。每个人都想分一杯羹。这始于政府。比如你**9点**上班，实际上你从**9点**到**12点**都在为税收工作。现在，这是一个重要的教训。政府不要求你预算来支付税款。他们会自动从你那里扣除税款。他们会自动从你那里扣除**社会保障**。他们会自动从你那里扣钱，因为他们知道，如果他们不从你那里扣钱，你就什么也拿不出来。然后人们从**12点**工作到大约**3点**用于住房和食物，然后从**3点**到**5点**用于所有其他事情。在美国乃至全世界积累财富的人，他们做了一些不同的事情。他们保留了每天收入的第一个小时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: We know for a fact that making more money doesn't make you rich. So, so people can go, as I told you earlier, like from $100,000. They can go from 50,000 to 100,000 and still be broke. They can go from a h 100,000 to 200,000 a year and still be broke. They can go from 200,000 to 300,000 and still be broke. In the US, when you take households that make $150,000 a year, one out of three of them are still broke. When you peel back the curtain and you ask why is that? Well, we know things cost more, but we also know there's massive lifestyle creep, right? you get you get around other people who are making more money and then you spend more money. And the reality is these phones are designed to get you to spend everything, right? Today with the algorithms, there's better technology today than there's ever been to get you to spend more money. And nobody wants you to spend money once. They want you to spend money for a lifetime, right? It's a lifetime value of a customer. So there's a battle for our income. And everyone wants a piece of it. It starts with the government. like you go to work and you go to work at 9ine and you actually work from nine o'clock to 12 for taxes. Now, this is an important lesson actually. The government doesn't ask you to budget to pay taxes. They take your taxes from you automatically. They take social security from you automatically. They're they take the money from you automatically because they know you won't have anything to give if they don't take it from you. Then people work from 12 to about 3:00 for housing and food and then from 3:00 to 5:00 for all the rest all the rest of things. The people who build wealth in America and really all over the world, they do something different. They keep the first hour a day of their income.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 你这是什么意思？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: What do you mean by that? So what that means is whatever you earn, you could be making minimum wage, you could be making $20 an hour, $30 an hour, $40 an hour. Whatever you earn, the first hour day of your income has to go to you. You're the first person who gets paid.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 你的意思是，无论你赚多少钱，无论是最低工资，每小时**20美元**、**30美元**还是**40美元**。无论你赚多少钱，你每天收入的第一个小时都必须归你。你是第一个拿到钱的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: What do you mean by that? So what that means is whatever you earn, you could be making minimum wage, you could be making $20 an hour, $30 an hour, $40 an hour. Whatever you earn, the first hour day of your income has to go to you. You're the first person who gets paid.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 你的意思是，你必须储蓄它，投资它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: And you mean you have to save it, invest it.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 你必须投资它。那么，如何在不交税的情况下投资你每天的第一个小时呢？答案是，使用**401k计划**，**先支付自己**。所以，如果你有一份工作，并且有**401k计划**这样的退休账户，你就注册并使用那个计划。现在，我不能就此打住，对吧？因为这听起来很简单，比如，好吧，我使用我的计划。不，你必须知道使用你的计划致富的公式。我们现在在**40年**后确切地知道，如果你想成为百万富翁，你需要做什么。我可以告诉你如何在二十多岁开始，到五十多岁中期完成，成为百万富翁。你每天存一点点，你收入的一个小时是你总收入的**12.5%**。我今天上网查了一下**401k百万富翁**的最新统计数据。**富达（Fidelity）**刚刚发布的新数据显示，现在有**65.4万**人在**富达401k计划**中成为了百万富翁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: You have to invest it. So how do you invest the first hour of your day without paying taxes? The answer is you pay yourself first using a **401k plan**. So, if you have a job with a retirement account, **401k plan**, you sign up and you use that plan. Now, I can't just stop right there, right? Because because it sounds so simple, like, okay, I'll use my plan. No, you have to know the formula to using your plan to be rich. We know after 40 years now exactly what you need to do if you want to be a millionaire. I can tell you how to become a millionaire starting in your 20s so that you're done by the time you're in your mid-50s. You save a little one hour of your income is 12 and a.5% of your gross revenue. I went on online today to look at what's the latest statistics with **401k** millionaires. The new stats that just came out from **Fidelity**. There are 654,000 people in **Fidelity 401k** plans that are now millionaires.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 什么是**401k**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: What is a 401k?

</details>

**[发言人]**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Okay,

</details>

**[主持人]**: 因为你知道我们有很多全球听众。每个国家都有不同类型的**401k**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: because you know we've got a lot of global listeners. There's different types of 401k in every country. So in

</details>

**[发言人]**: 所以在美国，**401k计划**是一个退休账户。它是一个公司设立的退休账户，对吧？它允许你免税地存钱。他们称之为税前。在大多数国家，你都有一个可抵税的退休账户，但这也要看国家，对吧？比如在**加拿大**，它与**澳大利亚**、**意大利**、**英国**的计划类型都不同。然而，几乎每个国家都有某种形式的退休账户，并且能够自动存钱。问题是，我将专门以美国为例，因为我大部分工作都在美国。那些拥有**401k计划**的百万富翁，他们所做的，这是确切的公式：他们储蓄了总收入的**14%**，他们的雇主在此基础上还有一小部分匹配。然后，他们如何投资这笔钱是关键，因为仅仅把钱存入这些**401k计划**是不够的。你必须投资以实现增长。增长意味着股票，对吧？所以你必须拥有，而且我刚才提到的这些**401k百万富翁**的实际具体配置是大约**70%**的股票和**30%**的债券。好的。那么，那些没有实现这一目标的人在做什么呢？嗯，普通美国人可能只储蓄**3%**或**4%**，如果他们有**401k计划**，可能**5%**。在许多情况下，没有**401k计划**的人甚至没有这样做。他们可以开一个**IRA账户**，但在大多数情况下，他们没有这样做。所以，整个秘密是：不预算，不使用纪律，让钱直接从你的工资中转出。工资自动存入，然后它在钱到达你的银行账户的那一天自动转出，首先用于退休。然后我们稍后会谈到建立一个安全账户，建立一个梦想账户。关键是钱会自动转出。所以，现在美国有**2400万**百万富翁。在短短**20年**内，我们看到美国的百万富翁从**800万**增加到**2400万**。他们是怎么做到的？财富主要有两个加速器：**股票**和**房地产**。如果你不投资股票，不投资房地产，你就会被甩在后面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: the US, a **401k plan** is a retirement account. It is a retirement account that the company has set up, right? And it allows you to put money away tax deductible. They call it pre-tax. In most countries, you have a deductible retirement account, but it depends on the country, too, right? Like in **Canada**, it's a different type of plan than it is in **Australia**, than it is in **Italy**, than it is here in the **UK**. Almost every country though has some form of retirement account and has the ability to put money away automatically. Here's the problem, and I'll use the US specifically because it's where I do most of my work in the US. Those who have a **401k plan**, the ones that are millionaires, what they did, here's the formula, the exact formula. They saved 14% of their gross income and their employer had a small match on top of that. And then how they invested the money is key because it's not enough to just put money in these **401k plans**. You have to be invested for growth. And growth means stocks, right? So you'd have to have and and the actual specific allocation in these **401k** millionaires I just talked about was about 70% stock and 30% bonds. Okay. Now, what are people doing that aren't achieving this? Well, the average American saving maybe 3 or 4%. Maybe 5% if they have a **401k plan**. People who don't have **401k plans** in many cases aren't even doing this. They can they can open up an **IRA account**, but in most cases, they're not doing that. So, the whole secret is not budgeting, not using discipline, having the money move right from your paycheck. paycheck gets deposited automatically and then it moves the day it hits your bank account automatically first for retirement. Then later we'll talk about building a security account, building a dream account. The key is that the money moves automatically. So in the **United States** now there's by the way 24 million millionaires now. So we've seen an increase of 8 million millionaires to 24 million millionaires in the US in just 20 years. How did they do that? There's two primary escalators to wealth. That is stocks and real estate. And if you're not in stocks and you're not in real estate, you are being left behind.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 当你说房地产时，是指有抵押贷款并拥有自己的房子吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: When you say real estate, does that mean having a mortgage and owning a h home?

</details>

**[发言人]**: 是拥有房屋或拥有**房地产投资信托基金（REITs）**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: It's owning a home or owning **REITs**?

</details>

**[主持人]**: **REITs**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: **REITs**.

</details>

**[发言人]**: **REITs**，**房地产股权投资信托基金**。所以，那是另一种购买房地产的方式，而无需实际拥有房屋，但你得不到相同的回报水平。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: **REITs**. Real estate equity investment trusts. So, that's another way to buy real estate without actually having to own the home, but you don't get the same level of returns.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 我的意思是，这是我们节目中多次讨论的热门话题之一，我的许多财务顾问嘉宾都说，拥有房屋是一项糟糕的投资。我想从研究和你书中了解到的，你对此有不同的看法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: I mean, this is um this is one of the hot topics of conversation we've had on this show several times is many of my guests that are sort of financial advisers say that owning a home is a bad investment. I think from what I understood from the research and from reading your books that you feel differently about that.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 是的。我的意思是，当我看到美国乃至国外财富的创造地时，我的感受完全不同。它在两个地方：**房屋净值**和**股票市场**。所以，当你看看住房，你看看拥有房屋的人，我们知道现在买房很难，但当你看看拥有房屋的人和租房的人，美国的房主，请注意这一点，美国的房主比租房者富有**40倍**。所以，今天美国普通房主的净资产超过**40万美元**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Yeah. I mean I I couldn't feel more differently when we look at where is wealth created in the **United States** and also abroad. It's in two places. It's in home equity and it's in the stock market. So when you look at housing and you take someone who owns a home and we'll talk about I know it's hard to buy homes right now but when you look at people who own a home versus people who rent homeowners in America follow this for one second. Homeowners in America are worth 40 times more than renters. So the average homeowner in America today is worth over $400,000.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 但这并不能建立因果关系。也就是说，这不意味着买房让他们致富，对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: But this doesn't establish causation. I.e. that doesn't mean that buying a home make made them rich, right?

</details>

**[发言人]**: 实际上是的。我将在这里详细解释。所以，普通租房者的净资产是**1万美元**，对吧？那么，为什么买房能积累财富？以及美国现在有多少财富在**房屋净值**中？《**华尔街日报**》两天前刚刚发表了一篇关于这个问题的文章。现在美国有**34万亿美元**的**房屋净值**。这个数字自疫情前以来增长了**90%**。另一部分钱在退休账户中，其中**60-70%**是股票。现在退休账户中有**45万亿美元**。所以，仅这两项加起来就等于**80万亿美元**，对吧？就像当你想知道财富在哪里创造时，它就在我们眼前。现在我们面临的问题，不仅在美国，我们现在在**伦敦**，许多城市都面临的问题是，房地产价格不断上涨，而人们的收入跟不上购房成本。所以，当有人来这样的节目说：“看，你不必买房。拥有房子比租房花费更多。你知道，我我看过一个节目，我不会说是谁，这不重要。他们都说同样的话：‘不要买房。你会受困。你必须支付房地产税，你必须支付保险，而且东西会坏。’”他们列举了所有这些开销，听起来好像“哦，是的。如果我租房会更便宜。”不。你认为当你租房时，谁来支付这些开销？是你。房东最终会将这些开销转嫁给租客。他们为什么要这样做？因为买房地产的人是为了投资。他们是为了投资而购买的。他们不是在补贴这些成本。所以，这听起来很难，尤其是当你年轻的时候。比如我有一个**22岁**的儿子。他在**芝加哥**。他将搬到**纽约市**。当他刚开始工作时，在**纽约**买房对他来说会非常困难。可能要两三年才能做到。很多年轻人在搬到大城市时，一开始买不起房。我大学毕业时，和你一样，负债累累。我有**1.2万美元**的**信用卡债务**。我记得打开账单时，房间都在旋转，心想我永远也摆脱不了**信用卡债务**，我怎么能买房呢？但我做到了。事实上，我年轻时不是一个人买房的。我和一个最好的朋友一起买的。那么，我是如何拥有第一套房子的呢？我们买的第一套房子价值**25万美元**。我们付了**10%**的首付，我和我最好的朋友**Andrew**分摊了这笔首付。所以我们每人付了**1.25万美元**。我们就是这样凑齐的。那房子完全是个需要翻修的破房子，我们没有足够的钱支付抵押贷款。所以我们把卧室租出去，让朋友租卧室，这帮助我们支付了抵押贷款。我们就是这样凑齐的，很多年轻人在年轻时都是这样做的。但如果你不进入**房屋所有权**的游戏，你在二十多岁时租房，三十多岁时租房，那么到了四十岁，你会发现自己没有任何净资产。**20年前**我写《**The Automatic Millionaire**》时，自那时以来发生了两件事。**股市**在**20年**内上涨了**600%**。好的？所以，如果你有**10万美元**，现在就变成了**60万美元**。如果你买了房子，房子上涨了**400%**。所以，当你读这本书时，里面有很多更新的成功故事。有很多普通人每天存**5美元**、**10美元**、**15美元**、**20美元**，买了一套入门房，今天他们都是百万富翁。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: It actually does. And I'm going to go through that here. So the average renter is worth $10,000, right? So why why does buying a home build wealth? and how much wealth in the **United States** is now in home equity. **Wall Street Journal** just ran an article on this came out two days ago. There's $34 trillion now in home equity in America. This number has gone up 90% since before co the other money is in retirement accounts which is 60 70% in stocks. There's $45 trillion now in retirement accounts. So those two things alone equal $80 trillion dollar, right? Like when you want to go like where are the breadcrumbs? Where is wealth being created? It's right in front of us. Now the problem that we have in the **United States**, but also look, we're here in **London** right now. Problem we have in so many cities is that real estate keeps going higher and higher and higher and people's incomes are not keeping pace with the cost of buying a home. So, when someone comes on a show like this and says, "Look, you don't have to buy a home. It's cost more to have a house than rent. You, you know, I I watched one of the shows. I won't say who it was. It doesn't matter. They all say the same thing. Don't buy a house. You'll be trapped. You'll have to pay you'll have to pay real estate taxes and you'll have to pay insurance and things break." They go through all these expenses and it it makes it sound like, "Oh, yeah. If I rent it'll be cheaper." No. Who who do you think pays these expenses when you rent? You do. The landlord passes the cost of these expenses on to the renter ultimately. Why do they do this? Because people who buy real estate buy it for an investment. They buy it for an investment. They're not they're not subsidizing these costs. So, it's a hard thing to hear and especially when you're young. Like I have a a son who's 22. He's in **Chicago**. He's going to move to **New York City**. It'll be extremely hard for him to buy a place in **New York** when he starts working right away. Just will be probably won't for two or three years. A lot of young people when they move to a major city, they can't afford to buy right away. When I came out of college, like you, I was in credit card debt. I had $12,000 in credit card debt. I remember opening up my bills and having the room spin and thinking, I'm never get out of credit card debt. how am I going to buy a house? But I did. And in fact, I didn't buy a home when I was young by myself. I bought a home with a best friend. So, how did I get my first house? First house we bought was a quarter of a million dollars. We put 10% down and my best friend and I, **Andrew**, we split that down payment. So, we each put $12,500 down. This is how we scraped it together. The house was a complete fixer upper and we didn't have enough money to make the mortgage payments. So, we rented out bedrooms and we had friends rent bedrooms and that helped us cover our mortgage. We scraped it together and that's what a lot of people do when you're young. But if you don't get in the game of home ownership and you rent in your 20s and you rent in your 30s, you're going to turn around in your 40s and having not been built any net worth. When I wrote **the automatic millionaire** 20 years ago, two things have happened since then. The stock market has gone up in 20 years 600%. Okay? So, if you had a $100,000, just that is gone to $600,000. If you bought a house, the house has gone up 400%. So, when you read this book with all these, there's a a whole chapter of updated success stories. There are a lot of ordinary people that started saving 5, 10, 15, $20 a day, bought a starter house, and today they're millionaires.

### 租房与购房的财富效应

**[主持人]**: 那么，我租房并投资股市，而不是买房，不是更好吗？因为很明显，当我买房时，我是在为房子支付溢价，这样我才能获得抵押贷款。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: So, am I not better off renting and investing in the stock market versus buying a house? Because obviously when I when I when I buy a house, I'm paying a premium on the house so that I can get a mortgage.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 我想打破这个神话，因为人们来这里说，股市，看，我现在就可以告诉你，过去**20年**，股市平均每年上涨超过**10%**。人们说，股市的回报比房地产好，是的，但这并不是苹果对苹果的比较。为什么？当你购买房地产时，当你购买房屋时，人们通常不会用现金支付他们的第一套房子，他们会支付**20%**的首付，然后借入另外**80%**。所以，举个例子，假设一套**20万美元**的房子。你投入**4万美元**。房子在**10年**内从**20万美元**涨到**40万美元**。自**新冠疫情**以来，在过去五年里，这种情况发生在很多人身上。美国各地都有房价上涨**100%到200%**的市场。所以，一个人买了**20万美元**的房子，他们借了**80%**。它翻了一番。所以他们赚了**20万美元**的利润。他们没有投入**20万美元**，他们投入了**4万美元**。所以，他们的首付获得了**五倍**的回报。他们去卖房子。他们不用为收益缴税，因为当你拥有房屋时，至少在美国，如果你拥有房屋超过两年。如果你是单身，你可以获得**25万美元**的免税收益。如果你已婚，你可以获得超过**50万美元**的免税收益。你可以获得抵押贷款的税收减免。所以，发生的情况是，人们来到这里说：“你知道吗？你不应该被束缚。你年轻的时候需要灵活。你不想承担责任，你应该把多余的钱投入共同基金。”**Stephen**，你知道现实世界中发生了什么吗？人们不会那样做。他们租了一套比他们负担得起更好的公寓，然后把所有的钱都花光了，然后到了三十多岁中期，他们没有任何净资产，因为他们什么都没买，也没有存钱。这绝对是一个该死的谎言，人们会把他们本可以用来买房的额外资金投入股市。他们不会那样做。这也是为什么，顺便说一句，**美国企业**开始在美国各地购买房地产、房屋，并建造公寓出租给整整一代人，希望这些人永远不买房。就在**10天前**，**特朗普**出来，基本上说他希望机构停止购买美国所有的房屋。他为什么要这样做？因为他认识到，有一代美国人是租房者，这是一个多么严重的问题。我告诉你，当你看看普通美国人，普通人，我指的是普通美国人。当你看看他们的财富在哪里时，它在**房屋净值**和**股票市场**中。这是我最后要说的，**代际财富**，无论好坏，都是通过**房屋净值**创造的。所以，当你看看为什么，你知道你问了关于因果关系的问题，如果一个家庭不买房，下一代买房的可能性非常低，因为当有人去世时，房子里的钱，**房屋净值**，通常会转移给下一代，帮助下一代买房。我正在看一些统计数据，因为我想，我希望我能让所有在我的节目中持不同意见并说买房是坏事物的嘉宾坐下来。

**[发言人]**: I want to bust this myth because what happens is people come on they go the stock look I can tell you right now the stock market over the last 20 years has averaged over 10% annually people go the returns are better in the stock market than the real estate yeah but that's not applesto apple comparison why you buy a piece of real estate when you buy a home people don't typically pay cash for their first house they put down 20% and they borrow the other 80%. So you take like an example of a take a $200,000 home. $200,000 home you put 40 grand in. Home goes from $200,000 to 400,000 in 10 years. This has happened to so many people in the last five years since **COVID**. There are markets all over the US where housing prices have gone up 100 to 200%. So a person buys a $200,000 home, they borrowed 80%. It's doubled. So they've made 200,000 in profit. They didn't put in 200,000, they put in 40. So, they got a five times return on their down payment. They go to sell their house. They don't pay taxes on the gain because when you own a home, at least in the **United States**, you own a home for over two years. If you're single, you get $250,000 in taxfree gains. If you're married, you get over half a million dollars in taxree gains. You get tax deductions on the mortgages. So, what happens is people come here and they go, "You know what? You shouldn't be you shouldn't be tied down. You need to be flexible when you're young. You don't want to have the responsibility and you should take the extra money and you should put it in a mutual fund. And you know what happens in the real world, **Stephen**? People don't do that. They rent an apartment that's nicer than what they can afford and they spend all their money and then they turn around in their mid30s and they have no equity because they haven't bought anything and they also haven't saved money. It is an absolute freaking myth that people take this extra money that they could have used to buy a house and they're going to put it in the stock market. They don't do that. And that's why also, by the way, corporate America got into the game of buying up real estate all over America, houses, and building apartments to rent to an entire generation, hoping these people never buy this. Like 10 days ago, **Trump** came out and basically said he wants the institutions out of buying up all the homes in America. Why does he want to do that? because he because he recognizes how serious of a problem it is to have a generation of Americans who are renters. I'm telling you, when you look at average Americans, average, I'm talking about ordinary Americans. When you look at where their wealth is, it's in home equity and it's in the stock market. And this is the last thing I'll say, generational wealth is created for better or worse through home equity. So when you look at why you know you asked the question about causation if a family doesn't buy a home the likelihood the next generation can buy a home is very low because it's this when someone dies the money that is in the house that home equity is often what transfer transfers to the next generation helps the next generation buy a house. I was looking at some stats here because I want to what I want I wish I could sit

**[发言人]**: 那会是一次非常有趣的对话。对。

**[发言人]**: it could be a really interesting conversation. Right.

**[主持人]**: 那会是一次非常有趣的对话。我作为这种方法的替代方案，我把他们说过的话都整理出来了。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: It would be a really interesting conversation. What I've done as an alternative to that approach is I've pulled up what they've said

</details>

**[发言人]**: 我会给你一些他们说过的话，这样你就可以反驳他们，并发表你的看法。他们常说的一点是，美国长期实际**通货膨胀**调整后的房价年均上涨约**1%**，我的一位嘉宾引用**Robert Schiller**作为证据。在扣除通常等于**1%到2%**的维护费、约**1%**的房产税、保险和交易成本后，平均净实际回报率接近零。所以，当你说住房是一项伟大的投资时，你指的是总增值，也就是总增值，还是扣除税费、维护费、保险和销售成本后的净回报？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: and I'm going to give you some of the things they've said just so so you can rebuttle them um and have your say on them. One of the things that they often say is that long-term real inflationadjusted home price appreciation in the US is about 1% annually and one of my guests cited **Robert Schiller** as the evidence of that. After maintenance um which usually equals 1 to 2% um property taxes which equals about 1% insurance and transaction costs the net real returns approach roughly zero on average. So when you say housing is a great investment, are you referencing the gross appreciation which is the the the total appreciation or the net returns after taxes, maintenance, insurance, and selling costs?

</details>

**[发言人]**: 所以当你深入研究这类数字时，它们是数字，但它们不是真实世界，对吧？所以，当你和今天拥有房屋并拥有**20年**的人交谈时，你问他们，他们的净资产中有多少现在是房屋净值，超过**50%**的净资产都在他们的房子里。你会在你的**YouTube**频道上看到人们，如果你读评论，我相信你会读。我读了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: So when you dig into these kind of numbers like this, what they are is they're numbers, but they're not real world, right? And so like when you when you talk to someone who owns a home today and they've owned it for 20 years and you ask them how much of your net worth is now in the equity in your house over 50% of their net worth is in their house. You will see people on your YouTube channel that literally if you read the comments and I'm sure you do. I do

**[主持人]**: 人们说这不是真的。

**[主持人]**: where people say it's not true. There

**[发言人]**: 我昨天在你的**YouTube**页面上看到一条评论。我只知道我买了一套房子，它的价值上涨了**3.5倍**，我买房时的租金是**1200美元**，如果我今天租那套房子，租金将是**4000美元**。所以，你必须明白的是，租金总是上涨的，**Stephen**。我在**纽约市**住了**18年**。当我**2001年**搬到**纽约市**时，一套非常好的公寓，一套不错的公寓，每月租金大约是**6000美元**。当我离开**纽约**时，同样的公寓每月租金是**2.5万美元**。看看这个数学的疯狂之处。现在，那套公寓从**200万美元**的公寓变成了**500万美元**的公寓。所以，我本可以租它，但在我的情况下，我拥有它，它的价值上涨了**300万美元**。所以，我有一些朋友在**纽约**租房**20年**了。他们没有积累任何净资产。我对这场对话没有任何既得利益。也就是说，我不卖房地产。我不是房地产经纪人。我不卖房地产。我只是在现实世界中看到了人们是如何积累财富的。这本书《**The Automatic Millionaire**》中的**McIntyres夫妇**，当他们来到我的办公室时，他们拥有**180万美元**的净资产，他**52岁**，能够退休，平均年收入**4万美元**。他们所有的钱都不是在股市里。他们在**加利福尼亚州圣莱安德罗**买了一套房子，他们称之为中产阶级社区。他们的房子当时价值约**30万美元**。他们还清了抵押贷款，并在他们街上又买了一套房子。他们把第一套房子租了出去。他们在他们街上买了第二套房子。他们还清了那套房子的抵押贷款。所以他们拥有两套完全没有债务的房子。一套房子他们有收入，一套房子他们自己住，没有债务。然后他们在**401k计划**中存了钱。所以，如果我是一个年轻人，或者甚至不是年轻人，一个中年人和老年人，如果我把本应支付给房子的首付，比如说我的首付是**2万美元**，我把它投入**标普500指数基金**，从长远来看，它不会比总房屋净值增长得更多吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: where people say it's not true. There was I read a comment yesterday on your YouTube page. All I know is I bought a house and it's gone up in value three and a half times and the rent when I bought the house was $1,200 and the rent today to buy that if I had that house if I was renting it would be $4,000. So the thing is you have to understand is that rents always go up, **Stephen**. Like I lived in **New York City** for 18 years. When I moved to **New York City** in 2001, a really nice apartment, a nice apartment was like $6,000 a month. When I left **New York**, that same apartment was $25,000 a month. Follow the follow the insanity of that math. Now, that apartment went from being $2 million apartment to a $5 million apartment. So, I could have been renting it, but in my case, I owned it and it went up in value $3 million. So, I have friends who have been renting in **New York** for 20 years. They have built no net worth. I have no vest interest in this conversation. Meaning, I don't sell real estate. I'm not a real estate agent. I'm not selling real estate. I've just seen in the real world how people have built wealth. the the the **McIntyres** in this book, **the automatic millionaire**, when they came into my office and they were worth $1.8 million and he was 52 and able to retire having earned an average of $40,000 a year. All their money wasn't in the stock market. They had bought a home in **San Leandro**, **California**, what he what they called a middleclass neighborhood. Their home at the time was worth about $300,000. They had paid their mortgage off and they had bought one more house on their street. They rented the first house. They bought a second house on their street. They paid that mortgage off. And so they owned two homes free and clear. One house they got income from. One house they lived in with no debt. And then they had saved money in their **401k plan**. So, if I was a young person or not even a young person, a middle-aged and older person who took my down payment that I was going to pay into the house, if let's say it was say my down payment was $20,000 and I put that into the **S&P 500** instead over the long run, won't that grow larger than the total home equity potentially?

</details>

**[发言人]**: **指数基金**理论不起作用的原因是：你不能住在**指数基金**里。你不能住在**共同基金**里。只要你活着，你就必须住在某个地方。人们应该这样做：看看你支付的租金。现在问自己一个问题：如果我每月支付**5000美元**的租金，很多人都是这样，对吧？你知道有人每月支付**5000美元**的租金吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Here's why the index fund theory doesn't work. You can't live inside an index fund. You can't live inside a mutual fund. You have to live somewhere as long as you're alive. Here's what people should do. Take a look at what you're paying in rent. Now, ask yourself a question. If I'm paying 5,000 a month in rent, which lots of people are, right? Do you know people paying 5,000 a month in rent?

</details>

**[主持人]**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: Yes.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 好的。所以，他们每年支付**6万美元**。我们取这个数字。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Okay. So, they're paying 60,000 a year. Let's take that number.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: Yeah.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 所以，在**10年**内，他们将花费**60万美元**的租金。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: So, over 10 years, they're going to spend $600,000 in rent.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: Yeah.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 如果租金不涨。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: If the rent doesn't go up,

</details>

**[主持人]**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: Yeah.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 在**20年**内，他们将花费**120万美元**的租金。如果租金不涨，在**30年**内，他们将花费**200万美元**的租金。如果租金不涨。但租金确实会上涨。所以，你只需要问自己一个问题：我是否要把所有这些花在租金上的钱，却一无所获？如果你真的认为租房比拥有房屋更好，那么你仍然应该考虑购买一些东西，然后租给别人。因为我向你保证，有人会在交易中致富。如果你是租客，你不是在租房交易中致富的那个人。租房是一个很好的短期解决方案。它不是一个很好的长期财富积累解决方案。人们常谈论的另一件事，你之前也提到了，是租房给你带来的**流动性**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: in 20 years, they're going to spend 1.2 million in rent. If the rent doesn't go up, in 30 years, they will have spent $2 million in rent if the rent doesn't go up. But the rent does go up. So, the question you just have to ask yourself is, am I going to take all this money that I'm spending on rent and never build anything? And if you really believe that renting is better than owning, then you should still consider the idea of buying something than that somebody else rents. Cuz I promise you, somebody's getting rich in the transaction. If you're the renter, you're not the one who's getting rich in the transaction of renting. It is a great short-term solution renting. It is not a great term long-term wealth building solution. The other thing that people often talk about and you you cited earlier is the mobility that renting gives you.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: Yeah.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 你儿子刚才在这里。他**16岁**。是的。很快他就会到拥有自己住处，思考不同职业机会的年龄，天哪，**人工智能**是件大事。所以他可能想去**旧金山**。然后他可能想去**佛罗伦萨**或其他任何地方生活。如果他买了房子，那么在心理上和财务上都有一个有趣的因素，那就是这会让你更难随生活机会而搬家。如果人们对未来工作的说法是真的，即我们一生中将拥有比过去更多的职业，那么人们可能会认为我们也将更加**流动**。所以，有没有一种说法是，买房可能会损害我的职业机会，我追求职业机会的能力？答案是可能，对吧？但关于租房，有趣的是，租房是一项主要的义务，对吧？通常，当你签订租约时，你会把自己锁定在一年租约中。有时你会把自己锁定在两年租约中。当你购买东西时，这假设你有钱购买东西，**Stephen**，看看这里，因为你手头有所有数据。看看在美国出售房屋的平均时间是多久。现在就**谷歌**一下，因为我要告诉你的是，在某些市场，你可以把你的房子挂牌出售，并在不到**90天**内卖掉。现在有些市场你可以在不到**30天**内卖掉你的房子。在很多情况下，当你拥有东西时，你实际上比租房时有更多的灵活性。如果你想卖掉它，它说从挂牌到销售的平均时间是**47到62天**，从挂牌到成交在**2025年**，包括**16天**在市场上和**30到45天**成交。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Your son was here a second ago. He's 16 years old. Yeah. Soon he'll be at the age where he's got his own place and he's thinking about different career opportunities and oh my god **AI** is this big thing. So he might want to go to **San Francisco**. Then he might want to go live in **Florence** and wherever else. if he's bought a place, there is a interesting sort of psychological but also financial component to the fact that it makes it harder for you to move with the opportunity of life. And if we are if if what people say about the future of work is true, that we're going to have many more careers in our lives than we did in the past, one might assume that we're also going to be more mobile. And so, is there an argument to say that buying a house might hurt my prof professional opportunities, my ability to pursue professional opportunities? The answer is possibly, right? But here's the thing about rent. Rent's, interestingly enough, a major obligation, right? Usually, when you go and you do a lease, you lock yourself into a one-year lease. Sometimes you lock yourself into a two-year lease. When you buy something, and this is assuming that you have the money to buy something, **Stephen**, look up because you've got all the data at your fingertips here. Look what the average length of time it takes to sell a home in the **United States**. Just just **Google** that right now because what I will tell you is in certain markets you can put your home on the market and you can sell it in less than 90 days. Now some markets you can sell your home in less than 30 days. In many cases you actually have more flexibility when you own something than when you rent. And that's if you want to sell it. It says the average time from listing to sale is about 47 to 62 days from listing to closing in 2025, including 16 days on the market and 30 to 45 days to close.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 那就是不到**2个月**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: That's called less than 2 months.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 即使在热门市场，从挂牌出售到合法出售一套房产也可能需要**1.5到3个月**。这意味着**房屋净值**不是一项可以快速变现的投资。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Even in hot markets, the process from putting a house on the market to legally selling it can take 1.5 to 3 months. Meaning home equity isn't a quickly accessible investment.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 是的。但你觉得这很快吗？**90天**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: Yeah. But do you think that's pretty quick? 90 days.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 不，是的。确实很快。我的意思是，你需要那么多时间才能摆脱租约。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: No, it is. It is quick. I mean it takes takes you that amount of time to get out of a lease.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 完全正确。所以现在你有一处房产，你可以在不到**90天**内转手卖掉。现在这是美国。你在意大利就不能这样做。比如在**意大利**，这样做可能非常困难。但在美国，你拥有的东西在一个好的市场里，它是**流动**的。另一件事是你可以租出去，对吧？你实际上并没有被困住。如果你开始在你的房子里积累**净值**，并且稍微还清你的抵押贷款，接下来你就会发现你能够出租那处房产，你仍然可以搬家。今天，人们把他们的房子拿出来做**Airbnb**。我真正希望人们拥有的是**财务自由**的机会。还有一个年龄段，你是否拥有房屋并不重要。你知道，一旦你开始变老，并且已经建立了**财务安全**，你到了五十多岁、六十多岁或七十多岁，你只想旅行，你不想拥有任何东西。那是人生的不同阶段。所以，问题就变成了你赚的钱。我回到**9万小时**的评论。当你一生中工作**9万小时**时，你有什么计划来保留一些钱？你必须有一个**先支付自己**的计划。那必须是你的第一要务，就是当你赚钱时，第一个你要支付的人是你自己。如果你说，你知道吗，我看了**Stephen**的节目，我看到了**David**，我还看到了他节目中的其他人，我不会买房。好的，那么你必须更多地**先支付自己**。现在，我过去**30年**一直在世界各地，从**奥普拉（Oprah）**开始，带着《**The Automatic Millionaire**》。我在**奥普拉**的节目上推出了这本书，我谈到你必须每天节省**1小时**的收入，人们会在社交媒体上说我无法节省**10%**的收入。他们会说我无法靠**90%**的收入生活。那是不可能的。我必须把所有的钱都花光。对吧？那么，那个租房而不买房的人，也就是不储蓄的人，显然永远不会储蓄。所以，买房的另一件事是它确实需要**强制储蓄**，因为当你支付抵押贷款时，抵押贷款的一部分是偿还你的债务。我教你如何使用**双周抵押贷款支付计划**。所以，你拿一个**30年**的抵押贷款，提前五年还清。这样做可以为你节省，取决于房屋的大小，可以为你节省**5万到10万美元**的利息支付。你谈论拥有储蓄心态。什么是储蓄心态？如果他们是那些说“听着，**David**，我勉强维持生计，而且现在债务越来越多”的人，他们该如何储蓄？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Exactly. So now so so here you've got a piece of property that you can turn around and sell in less than 90 days. Now this is the US. You can't do that. Like for inance I live in **Italy**. That could be very hard to do that in **Italy**. But in the US you've got something that's in a good market. It's liquid. The other thing is you can rent it, right? You're you're actually not trapped. If if you start to build equity in your home and you pay your mortgage down slightly, next thing you know you're able to rent that property and you can still move. Today, people are taking their homes and they're **Airbnbing** them. What I really want for people is the chance to be financially free. There's also an age at which it doesn't matter if you own. You know, once you start to get older and you've built financial security, you get in your 50s or your 60s or 70s and you just want to travel and you don't want to own anything. That's a different stage of life. So, the question just becomes the money that you make. I go back to the 90,000 hour comment. When you make n when you work 90,000 hours over your lifetime, what's your plan to keep some of this money? You have to have a pay yourself first plan. That has to be your number one priority is that when you earn money, the first person who you're going to pay is you. If you say, you know what, I watched **Stephen** and I saw **David** and I've seen a bunch of other people on his show and I'm not going to buy a house. Okay, then you have to pay yourself first more. Now I go around the world for the last 30 years starting with **Oprah** with **the automatic millionaire**. I launched this book on **Oprah** and I talked about you have to save 1 hour a day of your income and people will get on these social media boards and be like I can't save 10% of my income. They'll I can't live off 90% of my income. It's not possible. I have to spend all of it. Right? Well, then that person who's renting and not buying a house, which is for savings, is clearly never going to save. So, the other thing about buying a house is it does require force savings because when you use have a mortgage payment, part of that mortgage payment is paying down your debt. And I teach you how to use a bi-weekly mortgage payment plan. So, you take a 30-year mortgage and you pay it off five years earlier. And doing that can save you, depends on the size of the home, can save you $50 to $100,000 just in interest payments. You talk about having a savings mindset. What is a savings mindset and how does one go about saving if they are one of those people that says, "Listen, I'm barely getting by as it is, **David**."

</details>

**[主持人]**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: Yeah.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 我现在债务越来越多，我到底要怎么存钱？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: How how the hell am I going to save money when I'm actually increasingly getting into more debt right now?

</details>

### 找到你的钱：储蓄心态与策略

**[发言人]**: 所以，第一件事是你必须找到你的钱，对吧？所以，**Steve**，我发现，当我与人们交谈时，大多数人不知道他们的钱花到哪里去了。真的，他们不知道。他们会说，我问：“你一个月花多少钱？”嗯，我不太确定。你一年花多少钱？嗯，我不太确定。你需要确定。所以，你应该做一些事情来追踪你的钱花到哪里去了。现在，你可以很**复杂**。你可以使用应用程序。它会追踪你的钱花到哪里去了。你也可以拿出一张纸，我给人们一个**7天财务挑战**，连续七天。随身带一个小本子，每天写下你的钱花到哪里去了。现在，我为什么要人们这样做？因为今天大多数人都在无意识地花钱。我回到这些手机。我甚至不必再带钱包了，对吧？只是点击点击点击就可以支付。我们已经失去了对花钱的触感。所以，当人们开始看到他们真正花了多少钱时，这是一个**警钟**。我最近一直在分享的最重要的事情是，每天花多少钱才能每年挥霍**1万美元**？你每天需要花多少钱才能挥霍**1万美元**？现在，给我们看看这里的每人。现在，我们今天有英镑，对吧？所以，嗯，我手里现在拿着，**Stephen**，我手里拿着一块砖。所以，我不知道你的员工有没有告诉你我手里拿着多少钱。你知道我手里拿着多少钱吗？你猜猜看？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: So, the first thing is you have to find your money, right? So, what I what I find, **Steve**, is when I talk to people, most people don't know where their money goes. Literally, they don't know. They're like, I'm like, "How much money you spend a month?" Well, I'm not really sure. How much money you spend a year? Well, I'm not really sure. You need to be sure. So, you should be doing something to track where your money goes. Now, you can be sophisticated. You can use apps. It will track where your money goes. You can also take out a pad of paper and I give people a **7-day financial challenge** for seven days. Just bring a little pad of paper with you and write down every single day where your money goes. Now, why do I want people to do that? Because most people today are spending money unconsciously. I go back to these phones. The fact that I don't I don't even have to carry a wallet anymore, right? It's just click click click and pay for things. We've lost touch with spending money. So, when people start to see what they're really spending, it's a wakeup call. The biggest thing I've been sharing lately is what does it take to blow $10,000 a year per day in terms of spending? How much money do you need to spend a day to blow $10,000? Now, show us the per here. Now, we happen to have these are we have pounds today, right? So, um so I I'm holding **Stephen** right now. I'm holding what is known as a brick. So, I don't know if your staff told you how much I'm holding here. You know how much what you guess I'm holding?

</details>

**[主持人]**: 看起来像是**5000美元**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: It looks like maybe $5,000.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 好的。所以，**Stephen**，这是改变人生的钱。这里是**1万美元**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Okay. So, this is a life-changing amount of money, **Stephen**. This This is $10,000 right here.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 那么，每天花多少钱才能每年挥霍**1万美元**？你每天需要花多少钱才能挥霍**1万美元**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: And what does it take to blow $10,000 in a year per day? How much money you have to spend per day to go through $10,000?

</details>

**[发言人]**: 我来帮你简化一下。答案是每天**27.40美元**。每天**27.40美元**加起来一年就是**1万美元**。现在，在我们讨论你把这些钱花在哪里之前，你每天是如何浪费**27.40美元**的？问题是，如果你没有每天浪费**27.40美元**，并且能够每年投资**1万美元**，随着时间的推移，这笔钱会值多少钱？答案是，如果这笔钱在**40年**内投入**标普500指数基金**，你之前引用过，并且你每年获得**10%**的收益，加上再投资的股息，那笔钱将增长到**440多万美元**，如果你每天投资**27.40美元**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: I'll make it easy for you. The the answer is $27.40 a day. $27.40 a day adds up equaling $10,000 over the year. Now, before we go through where do you where do you spend this money? How do you waste $27.40 a day, the question becomes, if you didn't waste $27.40 40 cents a day and you were able to get yourself to invest $10,000 a year, what could this be worth over time? And the answer is in 40 years if this was in the **S&P 500** fund which you quoted earlier and you earn 10% annually with reinvested dividends that stack there would grow to 4 million four over $4,400,000 if you invested $27.40 a day.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 把这块大砖头给我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: Pass me this big brick.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Yeah.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 所以如果我每天存一半，那么你说是**40年**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: So if I save half of this a day then in did you say 40 years?

</details>

**[发言人]**: 在**40年**内。所以，让我给你几种不同的计算方式。好的，那么如果你每天投资大约一半的钱会发生什么？我用的数字是每天**27.40美元**。这是一个神奇的数字。它等于每年**1万美元**。如果你每天投资这些钱，坚持**40年**，你将拥有超过**442.4万美元**。

**[发言人]**: In 40 years. So, let me give you the math on a couple different ways of doing this. Okay, so what would happen if you invested roughly half of this a day? The number I use is $27.40 a day. It's the magic number. That equals $10,000 a year. If you invested that a day for 40 years, you'd have over $4,424,000.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 如果我每天投资**27美元**，**40年**后我将拥有**400万美元**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: If I invest $27 a day, in 40 years, I'll have $4 million.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 超过**400万美元**。现在让我们来讨论“但是”的问题，因为人们会听到这个。有些人会说：“等等，什么？”然后我们会讨论你在哪里能找到每天**27.40美元**。是的，但是**440万美元**在**40年**后不会值很多钱。考虑到**通货膨胀**，它不会值那么多钱。它不会有相同的购买力。我的回答是，它比零值钱得多。对吧？如果你没有存钱，如果你每天存不到**27.40美元**，你就不会有**440万美元**。是的，但是考虑到税收，你知道，它不会增长那么多。嗯，如果它在一个退休账户里，它可能会增长那么多。你就不必为这笔钱缴税。是的，但是我的钱不可能每年赚**10%**。嗯，**股市**在**100多年**里，每年平均收益超过**10%**，加上再投资的股息。是的，但是股市有风险而且复杂。嗯，不，它不复杂。如果你购买**指数基金**，它实际上并没有那么有风险和复杂。是的，但是我不知道。我不知道如何开始。嗯，你可以非常容易地开始。你可以开一个券商账户。你可以去**嘉信理财（Charles Schwab）**、**富达（Fidelity）**。我的意思是，我将逐一介绍它们。**先锋基金（Vanguard）**、**Robinhood**、**Coinbase**、**Acorns**，在不到**10分钟**内，你就可以开一个账户并开始储蓄。选择一个金额。每天**5美元**、**10美元**、**27美元**，这可以改变你的人生。现在，**Stephen**，为什么**1万美元**是一个如此重要的金额？我做了**30年**的这个工作，我可以告诉你。首先，这个金额，现在一半的美国人银行账户里没有**1000美元**。所以，这是美国一半人拥有的**10倍**。但更重要的是，**1万美元**。当我们进行调查时，我们问人们：“需要多少钱才能彻底改变你的生活？”答案不是**100万美元**。答案不是**10万美元**。答案实际上是**1万美元**。问题是，为什么是**1万美元**？原因在于，这大约是普通人所欠的**信用卡债务**。他们感觉自己像你之前谈到的那样，快要淹死了。他们知道这笔钱可以还清他们的**信用卡债务**。或者他们有一份不喜欢的工作，如果他们知道自己有**1万美元**的储蓄账户，他们就会辞掉那份工作，获得自由。他们必须去找另一份工作。

**[发言人]**: Over $4 million. Let's go through the yeah butts now because people are going to hear this. Some people are going to go, "Wait, what?" And then we'll talk about where you find $27.40 a day. Yeah, but $4,400,000 won't be worth a lot of money in 40 years. With inflation, it won't be worth that much. It won't have the same purchasing power. My answer would be it's worth a whole lot more than zero. Right? If you're not saving any money, if you can't save $27.40 40 cents a day, you won't have $4,400,000. Yeah, but with taxes, you know, it won't grow that much. Well, it could if it was in a retirement account. You wouldn't be paying taxes on the money. Yeah, but it's not possible to earn 10% on my money. Well, the stock market for over a hundred years has averaged over 10% annually with reinvested dividends. Yeah, but the stock market's risky and complicated. Well, no, it's not. If you bought an index fund, it's actually not that risky and complicated. Yeah, but I don't know. I don't know how to get started. Well, you could start really easily. You could open up a brokerage account. You could go to a **Charles Schwab**, **Fidelity**. I mean, I'm literally going to go through them all. **Vanguard**, **Robin Hood**, **Coinbase**, **Acorns**, and in less than 10 minutes, you could open up an account and be saving. Pick a dollar amount. $5 a day, $10 a day, $27 a day, and that could change your life. Now, why is $10,000, **Stephen**, such an important dollar amount? Here's what I can tell you, having done this for 30 years. This dollar amount right here, first of all, this is one in two Americans don't have $1,000 in a bank account right now. So, this is 10 times what one out of two Americans have. But more importantly, $10,000. When we do surveys and we ask people, "How much money would it take to totally change your life?" The answer is not a million dollars. The answer is not $100,000. The answer is actually$10,000. And the question is, why is it 10,000? And the reason is is that's about what the average person has in credit card debt. And they feel like they're drowning like you talked about earlier. and they know that that could pay off their credit card debt. Or they have a job they don't like and they if you knew that if they had $10,000 in a savings account, they'd quit that job and they'd be free. They'd have to go find another job

**[主持人]**: 或者创业什么的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: or start a business or something

</details>

**[发言人]**: 或者创业，或者天哪，他们处于一段虐待关系中，无法离开。但如果他们有**1万美元**，他们就会离开。所以，你知道，很多人会说：“**David**，你把这一切都说得太简单了。”确实如此。我这样做是因为当事情简单时，人们就会采取行动。所以多年来，我一直在教授这个概念，叫做**拿铁因子**。很多人因此喜欢我。现在也有很多人因此讨厌我。我一直教导说，我们会在小事情上浪费小笔钱。我让你的员工给我拿了一杯好咖啡。嗯，当我开始教授**拿铁因子**时，我会谈到我们每天在咖啡上浪费**5美元**。如果你不相信自己可以开始储蓄和投资，至少每天存**5美元**。在家自己煮咖啡。人们会说：“但我不想放弃我的咖啡。”好的。那么，想办法每天节省**5美元**。这杯冰咖啡，我不知道在**伦敦**要多少钱。在**纽约市**，那杯咖啡是**9.50美元**，加上小费。超过**11美元**。我知道，因为我刚从**纽约**回来。所以今天我们这里有很多道具，我说：“嗯，让我们试着展示**27.40美元**是什么样子。”比如我离开这里后去酒店，一杯鸡尾酒要**30美元**，对吧？我刚在**纽约市**喝了一杯鸡尾酒。我酒店里的一杯鸡尾酒是**31.50美元**。葡萄酒**50美元**。外出就餐。你今天去吃午饭，要**25美元**。人们说：“嗯，我必须吃饭。”我说，我知道你必须吃饭，但你也可以自己带午饭。我祖母就是这样做的。她的朋友们嘲笑她。但我的祖母能够退休到**加利福尼亚**。而她的朋友们都困在**威斯康星州密尔沃基**，那里很冷，因为她们无法像她那样退休。

**[发言人]**: or start a business or god forbid they're in an abusive relationship and they can't leave. But if they had $10,000, they'd leave. So, you know, a lot of people go, "**David**, you just make this all too simple." And it's true. I do because when it's simple, people take action on it. So for years, I have taught this concept called the **latte factor**. A lot of people love me for it. Now I have a lot of people hate me for it. And I have taught that, you know, we waste small amounts of money on little thing. I had your staff bring me a nice coffee. Um, when I started teaching the **latte factor**, I would talk about the idea that we waste five bucks a day on coffee. And that if you don't believe you can start saving and investing, at least save $5 a day. Make your coffee at home. And people would say, "But I don't want to give up my coffee." Okay. Well, then figure out another way to save $5 a day. This iced coffee, I don't know what it costs here in **London**. In **New York City**, that coffee right there is $9.50 plus a tip. It's over 11 bucks. I know because I was just in **New York**. So today we we had a bunch of props here and I said, "Well, let's try to show like what what is $27.40." Like when I go to my hotel later when I leave here, a cocktail is going to be 30 bucks, right? I was just in **New York City** cocktail. I had a cocktail in my hotel was $31.50. Wine $50. Eating out. You go and have lunch today, it's going to be $25. And people say, 'Well, I have to eat.' And I go, I know you do, but you could also brown bag your lunch. It's what my grandmother did. Now, her friends teased her. But my grandmother was able to retire to **California**. And her friends all got stuck in **Milwaukee**, **Wisconsin**, where it was cold because they couldn't afford to retire the way she did.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 实际上有多少人能每天存**27美元**？因为如果我再回顾我人生中**10多年前**，我根本不可能每天存**27美元**。根本不可能。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: How many people could actually save $27 a day? Because if I go back again, just over 10 years of my life, I mean, there's no chance I could save $27 in a day. There's just no there's just no there's no way

</details>

**[发言人]**: 如果你回到哪个年龄？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: if you go back to what age?

</details>

**[主持人]**: 如果我回到大约**18、19岁**那个时期。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: If I go back to between like 18 19 years old roughly that period of my life.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Yeah.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 我不可能每天存**27美元**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: There was no way I could have save $27 a day.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 真正的问题是：你有没有朋友？你认为有没有和你一起工作的人，年收入超过**5万美元**，但每天存不到**27美元**？他们甚至每天存不到**10美元**。这是真的。我实际上对此做了一些研究，它说大约**4000万到5000万**家庭，如果我们只看美国，我认为大约有**3.3亿**人口，大约**4000万到5000万**美国家庭可以实际每天存**27美元**。这大约占家庭总数的**30%到35%**。对于其他人，也就是底部的**65%到70%**，储蓄这个金额将需要极度贫困水平的预算，或者在数学上是不可能的。超过**4000万**人，他们认为可以负担得起每天存**27.50美元**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Here's really the question. Do you have friends and do you think you have people who work with you who are making more than $50,000 a year and they're not saving $27 a day? They're not even saving $10 a day. This is true. I actually did a bit of research um on this and it says approximately 40 to 50 million families, if we just take the **United States** where I think there's what 330 million people roughly um approximately 40 to 50 million families in the US can realistically save $27 a day. This represents roughly the top 30 to 35% of households. For everyone else, the bottom 65 to 70%. Saving that amount would require either extreme poverty level budgeting or is a mathematical impossibility. over 40 million people they think can afford to save $27.50 a day.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 是的。这是基于**2025年到2026年**的收入和支出数据。大约**4000万到5000万**美国家庭可以实际每天存**27美元**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Yes. It's based based on income and expenditure data from 2025 to 2026 approximately 40 to 50 million families in the US can realistically save $27 a day.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 所以对于美国那**4000万到5000万**人来说，那将是改变人生的。那么有没有人负担不起这个金额呢？当然有。在美国，我刚在**亚利桑那州**做了一场主题演讲。我问听众，当时政府停摆了，我说：“你们认为美国有多少人正在领取**SNAP支票**？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: So for those 40 to 50 million people in the **United States** that would be lifechanging. Now are there people who can't afford to say that? Absolutely. In the **United States** I I was just in uh **Arizona**. I just did a keynote speech. I asked the audience, this is when the government was shut down. I said, "How many people do you think in America are taking and receiving **SNAP checks**?"

</details>

**[发言人]**: 那是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: What's that?

</details>

**[发言人]**: 谢谢你。因为，顺便说一句，大多数美国人甚至不知道**SNAP支票**是什么。那是政府给人们的食物支票。金额略高于每天**6美元**。所以，房间里的聪明人，顺便说一句，我一周前也不知道答案。答案是大约**4150万**美国人领取**SNAP支票**。当我告诉房间里的人时，房间里的人都倒吸了一口凉气。我说：“所以当你听到政府停摆了六周时，那是三个发薪周期。”嗯，普通美国人没有两周的开支储备。我的意思是，我认为并不是每个人都完全理解现在的问题。**40%**的美国人在紧急情况下拿不出**1000美元**。如果你深入研究**美联储**的数据，**37%**的美国人在紧急情况下拿不出**400美元**。所以，美国有一整个群体确实在挣扎。但是，美国还有很多人仍然在挣扎。他们是月光族，但他们的钱一直被拿走，因为他们没有计划。对于我研究中提到的那**60%**的美国人，他们无法每天存**27美元**。嗯，数据显示存在一个**可支配收入**的悬崖。一旦你跌破收入前**40%**，账单支付后可用的钱就会迅速消失。前**20%**的家庭，我认为年收入**9.6万美元**，有盈余。中间**20%**的家庭有**1.5万美元**的盈余，其中每天**27美元**占了**66%**。但底部**40%**的家庭通常只有大约**2000美元**的盈余。所以，对于底部**40%**的人来说，达到**1万美元**是不可能的。对他们有什么建议？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Thank you. Because, by the way, most Americans don't even know what a snap check is. That's a check that the government gives to people for food. And the dollar amounts a little over $6 a day. So, smart people in a room, by the way, I didn't know the answer to this a week prior either. The answer is about 41 and a half million Americans get a **snap check**. When I told the room that, the room gasped. I said, "So when you under when you hear that the government was shut down for six weeks, that was three pay cycles." Well, the average American doesn't have two weeks of expenses set aside. I I mean, I don't think everybody fully grasps the problem right now. Four out of 10 Americans can't get their hands on $1,000 in case of emergency purposes. If you actually dig into the **Federal Reserve** data, it's 37% of Americans can't get their hands on $400 in case of emergency purposes. So, there's a whole section of America that's truly struggling. Like, but there's a whole lot of America that is still struggling. They're living paycheck to paycheck, but their money is being taken from them all the time because they don't have a plan for it. For that bottom 60% of Americans that my research says wouldn't be able to save $27 a day. Um, the data reveals a discretionary income cliff. Once you drop below the top 40% of earners, the money available after bills vanishes rapidly. The top 20% which earn I think $96,000 per household are in a surplus. The middle 20% um have a $15,000 surplus uh which the $27 a day takes 66% from. But the bottom 40% often have a roughly $2,000 surplus. So it's impossible for them to get to the $10,000 for that bottom 40%. What's what's the advice for them?

</details>

**[发言人]**: 从一点点开始。好的。就像我们把这**50美元**分成两半，**25美元**。我会说你能每天存**1美元**吗？我实际上谈过这个非常简单的想法。你能每天存**10美元**，持续**100天**吗？所以，如果你现在正在听我说话，并且你确实正在挣扎，我的问题是你能每天存**10美元**，持续**100天**吗？为什么？因为它会让你达到你的第一个**1000美元**，而现在超过**50%**的美国人没有储蓄。我无法告诉你，有多少人在**100天**后回来告诉我：“好的，我做到了。这并不容易。”对一些人来说，每天存**10美元**可能真的非常困难。但是，你热衷于健身。你看到了我儿子刚进来。健身是通过日常行动建立起来的，对吧？它是通过日常行动建立起来的。每天吃好，去健身房，定期做某些事情。储蓄也是一样。有一家公司叫**Acorns**。我早在**2015年**就投资了**Acorns**。**Acorns**开发了一款应用程序，可以帮助你把零钱凑整。所以，如果我去**星巴克**花**9.50美元**买一杯咖啡，你可以把**50美分**凑整到**10美元**，然后把这些钱投入投资。仅仅是把零钱凑整。在过去**10年**里，人们通过仅仅把零钱凑整，已经节省了数万美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Start with something. Okay. It's like we took this 50 and we said cut it in half 25. I would say can you save a dollar a day? I have actually talked about this idea really simple. Could you save $10 a day for 100 days? So like if you're listening to me and you happen to really be struggling right now, my question would be could you save $10 a day for 100 days? Why? Because it would get you to your first $1,000 and you now have more than 50% of Americans who don't have savings. And I can't tell you how many people have come back after a hundred days and said, "Okay, I did it. It wasn't easy." For some people, saving $10 a day could be really really hard. But you're you're into fitness. You saw my son who just came in here. Fitness is built through daily action, right? It's built through daily action. Daily eating well, going to the gym, doing certain things on a regular basis. Savings, the same thing. There's a company called **Acorns**. I invested **Acorns** back in 2015. **Acorns** came up with an app that helps you roll your change up. So, if I go to **Starbucks** and I spend $9.50 on a coffee, you can round it up where the 50 cents to 10 bucks is put into investments. Just rounding up your change. And people have saved tens of thousands of dollars over the last 10 years by just rounding up their change.

### 债务管理：雪球法

**[发言人]**: 我有一个朋友联系我，我向我之前在节目中交谈过的一位财务顾问和教育者谈论了他。他告诉我他负债累累。他可能每年赚大约**5万英镑**或美元，但却背负了真正的债务。我想我的许多听众都多少有些债务，无论是**信用卡债务**还是贷款或其他。你对目前被债务缠身的人有什么具体的建议吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: I had a friend of mine contact me and I I spoke to one of the previous financial adviserss and educators that I'd spoken to on the show about him. He told me he was in deep financial debt. Probably earns about £50,000 or dollars a year, but has got himself into real debt. And I imagine a lot of my listeners are are somewhat in debt, whether it's credit card debts or loans or others. Do you have any specific advice to people that are currently straddled with debt?

</details>

**[发言人]**: 当然。因为这是你最需要知道如何摆脱的事情之一。债务就像流沙。你知道，你之前谈到你负债累累，那是什么感觉。我大学毕业时，有**1.2万美元**的**信用卡债务**，感觉就像肩上扛着千斤重担。就像我背着一个**50磅**的背包。我是如何摆脱债务的？你如何摆脱债务？我将给你一个非常简单的摆脱债务的公式：**DOLP**。**DOLP**代表“**Done On Last Payment**”（在最后一笔付款时完成）。如果你对我说，**David**，我有五张**信用卡**。我会说：“好的，**Stephen**，我会拿一张纸，就像这样，然后开始列出你的**信用卡**。”我会写一、二、三、四、五。我会把它们都列出来。**Visa**、**Mastercard**，我会把它们列出来。然后我想知道，**Steve**，你欠了多少钱？所以，我会把金额写下来。我会在纸上把金额从小到大列出来。然后我想知道利率。现在，人们会说：“哦，你应该先还清利率最高的。”但我不会那样告诉你，**Stephen**。我会告诉你，你先还清最小的**信用卡**。我不在乎利率是多少。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Absolutely. Because it's one of the most important things you need to know how to get out of. Debt is like quicksand. Like you know, you talked earlier about how you were in debt and what that felt like. When I came out of college and I had $12,000 in credit card debt, it felt like the greatest weight on my shoulders. Like I was carrying like a 50 lb backpack. And how did I get out of debt? How do you get out of debt? I will give you the very simple formula to getting out of debt. **DolP**. **DolP** stands for done on last payment. If you said to me, **David**, I've got five credit cards. I'd say, "Okay, **Stephen**, I'd take a piece of paper just like this and I'd start listing your credit cards." I'd go one, two, three, four, five. And I'd list them all. **Visa**, **Mastercard**, and I'd list them. And then I want to know, **Steve**, how much do you owe? So, I put the dollar amount down. And what I would do is I put the dollar amount down on paper and I list it small to large. Then I want to know the interest rate. Now, what people say is, "Oh, you should take the highest interest rate and pay it off first." But I wouldn't tell you that, **Stephen**. I'd tell you you take the smallest credit card. I don't care what the interest rate is.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 金额最小的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: The smallest amount.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 金额最小的。所以这张卡可能是**500美元**。而这张卡可能是**3000美元**。我会让你自动支付每张卡的最低还款额。这非常重要，自动化的部分。我会让你上网，我真的会去你家，我会打开你的**iPad**，让你在线自动支付最低还款额，这样每张卡都能按时支付。然后我会说：“**Stephen**，你还有多少额外的钱？”因为我希望你把所有的钱都投入到最小的那张卡上。我们要尽快还清那张小卡。我们会把所有额外的钱都加到那张小卡上。所有卡都只付最低还款额。一旦那张卡还清了，我们就会这样做。你不必关闭账户，因为我们不想降低你的信用评分，但我们会把那张卡放在一边，永远不要再用它。现在，我们要去还下一张最小的卡。有些人称之为**雪球法**。我教这个系统的原因是它能尽快减少你拥有的**信用卡**数量。你会看到自己取得了进展。在财务方面做任何事情，看到自己取得进展非常重要。然后我会处理利率，因为利率并不总是永久不变的。你可以协商降低你的利率。你可以把**信用卡**转移到另一张低利率的卡上。但是当你这样做时必须非常小心，因为他们正等着你犯错，比如逾期付款。当他们这样做时，他们会再次提高**信用卡利率**。如果你真的在挣扎，你也可以打电话给你的**信用卡公司**，告诉他们：“我正在挣扎，我想知道你们是否有计划可以停止利率，并以更易于接受的方式还清这些卡。”这基本上就是非营利性**信用卡咨询组织**所做的事情。但**信用卡公司**通常也有这样的计划。他们会告诉你停止使用这张卡。他们实际上会让你无法再使用这张卡，但他们会停止利率。所以，这种方法帮助了很多人摆脱了**信用卡债务**。现在，我只想说一些非常重要的事情，因为我经历过这些。当你努力摆脱**信用卡债务**时，这是一次巨大的胜利。不要出去用**信用卡**庆祝，因为我大学三年级时摆脱了**信用卡债务**，然后我出去庆祝，又重新陷入了**信用卡债务**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Smallest amount. So maybe this card right here is $500. And this card down here is 3,000. I'd have you make minimum payments on every card automatically. This is really important, the automatic part. Have you go on I'd literally go into your house. I'd open up the I'd open up your **iPad** and I'd have you make minimum payments online automatically so that every card's paid on time. Then I'd say, "**Stephen**, how much extra money do you have?" Because I want you to put it all towards the smallest card. We're going to get that small card paid off as fast as possible. We're going to add all the extra money to that small card. Minimum payments on everything. Once that card's paid off, we're going to go like this. You don't have to close the account because we don't want to lower your credit score, but we're going to put that card over here. never use it. Now, we're going to go to the next next smallest card. Some people call this the **snowball approach**. The reason I teach this system is it reduces the amount of credit cards you have as fast as possible. And you see yourself make progress. It's really important to see yourself make progress when you're doing anything financially. Then I would attack the interest rates because the interest rates aren't always permanent. You can negotiate your rates lower. You can move credit cards to another card with a low interest rate. Have to be very careful though when you do that because they're waiting for you to make a slip up and make a late payment. And when they do, they'll jack the credit card interest rates back up again. You can also call up your credit card companies if you're really struggling and tell them, "I'm struggling and I'd like to know if you have a program in place where I can stop the interest rate and pay these cards off and more accessible." Like this is basically what the nonprofit credit card counseling organizations do. But the credit card companies often have programs too for this. They'll tell you to stop using the card. they'll actually make it so you can't use the card anymore, but they'll stop the interest rate. So, that approach has helped so many people get out of credit card debt. Now, I just want to say something super important because I've gone through this. When you go through the work of getting out of credit card debt, it's a huge victory. Don't go out and celebrate on the credit cards because I got myself out of credit card debt in college, junior year, and then I went out and celebrated and got myself back into credit card debt.

**[主持人]**: 人们总是这样做。通常人们至少会陷入两次困境，有时是三次。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: And people do this all the time. Usually people get themselves in a hole at least twice, sometimes three times.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 不要再陷入困境了。我**30年**没有使用**信用卡**。我只使用**借记卡**，而且我必须每月还清。那些处于底部**60%**的人，他们应该考虑如何赚更多的钱，如何增加收入吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Don't go back in a hole again. Uh I didn't carry credit cards for 30 years. I only carried a debit card and I had to pay it off every month. Should these people um who are in the bottom sort of 60% be thinking at all about how to make more money, how to increase their income?

</details>

### 增加收入与职业发展

**[发言人]**: 当然。那么，根据你自己在职业世界中的经验，你推荐的最简单的方法是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Absolutely. And what are the like the easiest ways to do that would that you'd recommend just from your own experience of you know being in the professional world and

</details>

**[发言人]**: 所以我的经验是，我知道你看，你写了这本很棒的书《**Diary of a CEO**》，对吧？任何还没读过你书的人，你都有这本很棒的书。如果你有一份工作，增加收入最好的方法是什么？那就是做好你的工作，对吧？你可以有一份最低工资的工作，假设你在**麦当劳**工作，你有一份最低工资的**麦当劳**工作。**麦当劳**的老板，拥有那个特许经营权的人，非常需要优秀的员工。谁能成为赚更多钱的经理？工作表现非常好的人。现在，很多人，我不知道我是否想在**麦当劳**工作。我只是举个例子。无论你在哪里工作，你增加收入的方法就是做到最好。你早到。你在工作中有计划。你工作到很晚。你言出必行。你不会等着别人告诉你该做什么，对吧？就像我一生都是企业家。成为企业家最困难的事情是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: so my experience and I know that you look you wrote this great book **diary of a CEO** right anybody hasn't read your book you have this great book what's the best way to grow your income if you have a job it's to be good at what you do right you can have a job at minimum wage let's pretend you work at **McDonald's** and you have a job working minimum wage **McDonald's**. The owner of **McDonald's**, the guy who owns that franchise or the gal that owns that franchise desperately needs good employees. Who becomes a manager that makes more money? The person who works really well. Now, a lot of people, I don't I don't know if I want to work **McDonald's**. I'm just giving it as an example. Anywhere you work, how you grow your income is you are the best at what you do. You show up early. You have a game plan at work. You work late. You do what you say you're going to do. You don't wait to be told what to do, right? Like I've been an entrepreneur all my lifetime. The hardest thing about being an entrepreneur is what?

</details>

**[主持人]**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: Yeah.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 一切。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Everything.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 是一切。大多数企业家会说：“嗯，你知道，很多时候很难找到好员工，除非你是一个好的领导者。”人们渴望有目标和意义的工作。大多数人实际上都在寻找领导力。所以如果你能把你的工作做得非常好，你就会赚更多的钱。世界上的财富没有限制，对吧？就像我们一生中从未见过像现在这样创造出如此多的财富。如果我年轻，很多人会说，嗯，你应该学习**人工智能**。是的，你知道吗？你可能确实应该学习如何使用**人工智能**，因为如果你不学习如何使用**人工智能**，你的技能就会非常有限，只能从事某些工作。你知道人们还会做什么吗？学习如何成为水管工。学习如何成为电工。学习如何安装车库门。我有一些朋友。我最近在一个播客上遇到一个人，他通过安装车库门赚了**10亿美元**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: It's everything. And most people are entrepreneurs go, "Well, it's, you know, a lot of times it's hard to have good people unless you're a good leader." People are so thirsty to have jobs with purpose and meaning. And most people are actually looking for leadership. So if you can be really good at what you do, you will make more money. There's no limit to wealth in the world, right? Like we've never seen so much wealth being created in our entire lives as right now. If I were young, a lot of people, well, you should learn **AI**. Yeah, you know what? Probably you definitely should learn how to use **AI** because if you don't learn how to use **AI**, you're going to have really limited skills and go the and do certain jobs. You know what else people are going to go out and do? Learn how to be a plumber. Learn how to be electrician. Learn how to put up garage doors. I've got friends. I got I was just recently on a podcast with a guy who's made a billion dollars putting in garage doors.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 他带我参观了他的仓库，给我看了他们的车库门模型。我说，你知道，我有一个朋友做车库里的健身房。我只是把他们联系起来了。他有一个巨大的业务，为车库制造健身房。机会是无限的。但是你必须摆脱僵化的思维模式。我的意思是，你这里有**Tony Robbins**。如果有人能帮助你摆脱僵化的思维模式，那就是他，对吧？但你不能，你不能有他们。**Zig Ziggler**曾经称之为“**臭气熏天的思维**”。你必须有能力展望未来，并相信你的未来可以像今天一样令人兴奋，甚至更好。我昨天发了一个帖子，我说，嗯，我宁愿做一个乐观主义者，即使错了，也不愿做一个悲观主义者，即使对了。如果你给我看一个想赚更多钱的人，他会以乐观的心态进入世界，并想办法赚更多的钱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: And he took me through his warehouse and showed me their garage door models. And I was like, you know, I've got a friend who makes gyms that go in garages. I just connected them. He's got a huge business making gyms for garages. There's just no limit to the amount of opportunities out there. You have to though get out of a stuck mind frame. I mean, you had **Tony Robbins** here. If there's anybody who can help you get out of a stuck mind frame, it's that guy, right? But you can't you can't have they **Zig Ziggler** used to call it stinking thinking. You have to have the ability to look into the future and believe that your future can be as exciting today or better. I put up a post yesterday. I said, um, I would rather be an optimist and be wrong than a pessimist and be right. And you show me somebody who wants to make more money, go into the world an optimist and figure out how to go make more money.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 你认为很多事情的核心是心态吗？显然存在真实的社会经济因素，人们生活在某些特定环境中，如果我回想起我出生在**博茨瓦纳**，那里机会更少，有时还有压迫性政府和其他客观上会让你陷入困境的因素，但如果所有其他条件都相同，心态在游戏中占据多大比重？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: Do you think a lot of this is a mindset at at at the core of it? Obviously there are real socioeconomic factors and there's people live in certain situations and if I think back to you know where I was born in **Botswana** there's just less opportunity and sometimes you have repressive governments and other factors that will objectively keep you stuck but all other things being equal how much of the game is mindset.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 归根结底都是一个决定。我们一开始就谈到了我的祖母。如果我的祖母在**30岁**时没有做出决定，她不想再贫穷，她厌倦了月光族的生活。如果她没有决定出去自学理财，并从她的工资中拿出**50美分**，从我祖父的工资中拿出**50美分**，然后开始投资，我今天就不会在这里。她做出的一个决定，对我们家庭产生了连锁反应。她通过那一个决定为自己建立了**财务安全**。她教我父亲如何投资，他做了**45年**的财务顾问。我姐姐是财务顾问。我曾经是财务顾问。我过去**30年**都在教人们理财。一个女人的决定产生了这种连锁反应。所以，我对听众说，尤其是妈妈们：有时你必须做出一个不仅仅是为了你自己的决定。你实际上是在为你的家庭做决定。你可以列出为什么这些事情行不通的理由。现在正在看或听我们节目的人，他们已经对此感兴趣了。这就是他们在这里的原因。现在，他们在这里有几个原因。要么是A，他们在财务上受到了伤害，他们知道他们需要解决一些问题。太好了。从你所在的地方开始。解决需要解决的问题。有些人会说，你知道，我觉得我做得很好，但我不确定我是否一切都做得很好。你知道，我开了我的**罗斯IRA**，或者我开了我的**401k计划**。我存了一些钱，但我不知道我是否存够了钱。那么你就可以改进你正在做的事情。有些人会说，我租房。我想有一天能买一套房子。好的，把那作为目标。我教导金钱方面的三个“桶”。三个篮子。**先支付自己**用于退休。我们甚至还没有谈到紧急情况。把钱存起来用于紧急情况。必须谈谈这个。你必须为紧急情况存更多的钱，然后建立一个**梦想账户**。你需要为你的梦想存钱。这三个账户都应该自动化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: It always comes down to a decision and we started by talking about my grandmother. If my grandmother hadn't made a decision at 30 that she didn't want to be poor, she was tired of living paycheck to paycheck. If she hadn't decided that she would go out and teach herself about money and take 50 cents of her paycheck and 50 cents from my grandfather's paycheck and start investing, I wouldn't be here today. She made a decision that had a ripple effect through our family. She built financial security for herself with that one decision. She taught my father how to invest and he was a financial adviser for over 45 years. My sister's a financial adviser. I was a financial adviser. I spent the last 30 years teaching people about money. One woman's decision had this ripple effect. So, one thing I say to people who are listening, especially the moms, sometimes you got to make a decision that's not just for you. You're actually making a decision for your family. and you can come up with a list of reasons why this stuff won't work. Somebody who's watching this show or listening to us right now, they're already interested in this. That's why they're here. Now, they're here for a couple reasons. Either A, they're hurting financially and they know they need to fix something. Great. Start where you are. Fix what needs to be fixed. Some people are like, you know, I think I'm doing pretty well, but I'm not sure if I'm doing everything well. you know, I I've I've opened up my **Roth IRA** or I've opened up my **401k plan**. I'm putting some money away, but I don't know if I'm putting enough money away. Then you can improve what you're doing. Some people like, I'm renting. I think I would like to buy a house someday. All right, make that a goal. I teach three buckets when it comes to money. Three baskets. Pay yourself first for retirement. We haven't even talked about emergencies yet. Putting aside putting aside money for emergency purposes. Have to talk about that. You got to you got to get more money put aside for emergency purposes and then building a dream account. You need to put money away for your dreams. Those three accounts should be automated.

</details>

### 自动化理财与三账户原则

**[主持人]**: 关于拥有三个账户这一点，你称之为**未来账户**、**应急账户**和**梦想账户**。你每月应该将多少收入存入这些账户？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: And on that point of having three accounts, you call it a future account, an emergency account, and a dream account. How much of your earnings should you be putting into each of those accounts on a monthly basis?

</details>

**[发言人]**: 好的。所以，保持超级简单。我建议每天**一小时**。再说一遍，我之前说过，这是你总收入的**12.5%**。当你说每天**一小时**时，你是说你每天工作时间的一小时。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: All right. So, keep it super simple. I recommend one hour a day. Again, said this earlier, it's 12 and a half% of your gross income. When you say 1 hour a day, you mean one hour of the the time you work per day.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 是的。所以，无论你每小时赚多少钱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: Yeah. So, whatever you make an hour.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Yeah.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 如果你每周工作**40小时**，你总收入的**12.5%**应该直接进入退休账户。现在，让我对那些抱怨的人说点什么。他们会说，我不可能从**0%**到**12%**。那是不可能的。那就从**1%**开始。如果你现在没有储蓄，并且正在听我们说话，当你离开这个播客时，你只做一个决定，那个决定就是我要储蓄我收入的**1%**，你这个月就开始这样做，你的生活就会改变。你的生活会改变，因为你开始了做出改变的过程。这就像你第一次去健身房一样。现在我告诉你，如果你节省**1%**的收入，你不会注意到它。如果你每个月都这样做，一年后，你将节省**12%**，你将是普通美国人储蓄的**四倍**，你将处于摇滚明星的状态。然后是第二个小时，这是人们思维爆炸的地方。但是第二个小时，所以第一个小时用于未来，第二个小时用于安全和梦想。所以你收入的**30分钟**，大约**5%**，应该进入**应急账户**，另外**5%**进入**梦想账户**。现在，那个**梦想账户**可以用于买房，可以用于为大学储蓄，可以用于你年底想去度假，可以用于结婚，可以用于订婚戒指，但你是在为你的梦想存钱。因为当你为你的梦想存钱时，它们才会变成现实。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: It's if you're say if if you're working a 40hour work week, 12 and a half% of your gross income goes off the top into a retirement account. Now, let me just say something up for the yahutters. They're like, I can't go from 0 to 12%. There's no way. Then start at 1%. If you're not saving right now and you're listening to us and all you do when you leave this podcast is make one decision and that decision is I'm going to save 1% of my income and you start that this month your life will change. Your life will change because you start the process of making a difference. It's just like the first day you go to the gym. Now I will tell you if you save 1% of your income you won't notice it. And if you did that every month for a year, at the end of the year, you would have saved 12% and you will be saving four times what the average American saves and you will be in a rockstar shape. Then the second hour, this is where people's minds blow up. But the second hour, so the first hour goes for the future, the second hour goes for safety and for dreams. So 30 minutes of your income, roughly 5% should go into an emergency account and another 5% goes into a dream account. Now, that dream account could be for buying a house, could be saving money for college, could be the vacation you want to take at the end of the year, could be getting married, could be the engagement ring, but you're putting money away for your dreams. Because when you put money away for your dreams, that's how they become real.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 你知道，这本书叫做《**The Automatic Millionaire**》。这本书单凭自己就卖出了**200多万册**。你为什么要用“**自动**”这个词？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: And you know, the book is called **The Automatic Millionaire**. This is a book that sold over two million copies um on its own. Why did you use the word automatic?

</details>

**[发言人]**: 除非你的财务计划是自动化的，否则它会失败。我怎么知道的？因为我在**摩根士丹利**做了九年的财务顾问，我亲眼看到。每个来到我办公室的普通收入者，他们积累财富的方式都是通过**自动储蓄**。每次有客户来到我的办公室，他们说：“我每个月都会亲自给你一张支票。”我从来没有一个客户储蓄超过六个月。他们都停了下来。一旦你决定自动化你的财务生活，它就会在后台运作。现在，问题是。其他人已经在对你这样做。你去健身房锻炼。他们不会要求你每个月给他们钱。他们会自动向你收费。你收到电话账单，他们会自动向你收费。今天，在很多情况下，当你租房时，他们会自动从你的账户中扣钱。银行会自动从你那里扣除抵押贷款。当你交税时，它们都是自动化的。每个人都会自动从你那里扣钱。你在手机上注册的每一样东西都是订阅服务。**Netflix**，今天检查一下你的**信用卡**。打开你的手机，看看你所有的订阅。所有这些企业都在自动从你那里扣钱。为什么？那是他们能够经营下去的唯一方式。他们知道，如果他们不自动从你那里扣钱，你就不会继续使用它们。大多数开始免费订阅的人，需要三到六个月才能关闭他们不使用的东西。我在这里让人们为自己自动化他们的财务生活。有没有简单的方法、应用程序、工具、网站可以让我们查看所有订阅并关闭它们？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Unless your financial plan is automatic, it will fail. How do I know this? Because I spent nine years as a financial adviser at **Morgan Stanley** and I got to see firsthand. Everyone who came into my office with an ordinary income who built wealth, they did it by saving automatically. Every single time a client came into my office and they said, "I'm going to bring you a check every month myself." I never had a client save for more than six months. They stopped. When it once you make the decision to automate your financial life, it works in the background. Now, here's the thing. Everybody else is already doing this to you. You go sign, you go to go to a gym to go work out. They don't ask you to bring them money every month. They automatically bill you. You get a phone bill, they automatically bill you. Today, in many cases, when you rent, they automatically pull the money out of your account. The banks automatically take money from you for your mortgage. When you pay taxes, they're all automated. Everyone takes money from you automatically. Everything that you sign up for on your phone is a subscription service. **Netflix**, go through your credit card today. Open up your phone, look at all your subscriptions. All those businesses are taking money from you automatically. Why? That's the only way they can be in business. They know if they don't get money from you automatically, you won't keep using them. Most people who start off with a free subscription, it'll take them three to six months to turn off something that they don't use. I'm here getting people to automate their financial life for themselves. Is there simple ways, apps, tools, websites we can use to go through all of our subscriptions and turn them all off?

</details>

**[发言人]**: 是的，有。所以，让我告诉你最简单的方法。这实际上是**苹果（Apple）**的免费宣传，好吗？因为很多人都有**苹果手机**。第一，只在**苹果**内部进行订阅。在理想世界中，不要直接支付给任何人。全部通过**苹果**进行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Yes, there are. So, let me tell you the easiest way. This is really actually free publicity for **Apple**, okay? Because so many people have **Apple** phones. Number one, only do your subscriptions inside of **Apple**. In an ideal world, don't pay anybody directly. Do it all through **Apple**.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 为什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: Why?

</details>

**[发言人]**: 因为如果你去手机底部，如果你不知道怎么做，你输入“订阅”，就会弹出你注册的所有东西，你可以点击点击点击把它们全部关闭。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Because if you go to the bottom of your phone and you don't know how to do this and you put subscriptions, up will pop everything that you've signed up for and you can go click click click and turn them all off.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 这样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: Do that.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 我要告诉你的另一件事是，当你注册任何东西时，比如说它是一年，因为现在所有东西都是一年试用订阅或一个月试用订阅。你注册的那一刻，就把它关掉。因为如果你注册任何东西，想想你能想象到的任何订阅。公司因此恨我。你一关掉它，当它需要续订时，他们就会给你一个更好的续订优惠。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Another thing I will tell you is that when you sign up for anything, let's say it's a one year because everything now is a one-year trial subscription or a one month trial subscription. The moment you sign up for it, shut it off. Because what happens is if you sign up for anything and think of any subscription you can imagine. Companies hate me for this. The moment you shut it off, when the time comes for it to renew, they will offer you a better deal to renew.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 好的，所以我打开了手机。我去了设置。我点击了设置中的我的名字，然后我点击了“订阅”按钮。我有一个、两个、三个、四个、五个、六个、七个、八个、九个、十个、十一个，其中三个我会保留。所以，所有这些其他的都在后台运行，那是因为我曾经使用过一个应用程序，它让我注册了某种免费试用，我完全忘记取消了。所以我有很多，天哪，有些是巨额的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: Okay, so I've opened up my phone. I've gone to the settings. I've clicked on my name in the settings and then I've clicked on the button subscriptions. I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11 of which three of them I would keep. So, all these other ones have just been running in the background and and it's because I used an app one time and it signed me up to some kind of free trial and I just totally forgot to cancel it. So, I've got Oh my god, some of them are massive.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 好的。所以，当你这样做的时候，你现在正在做的是一个真实的例子。所以，如果有人正在听我们说话，正在看这个，他们已婚，有孩子，或者他们是单身，这个练习，我猜会有很多很多人听了之后，可以找到每月**50美元**、**100美元**、**200美元**可以关闭的开销，并将这些钱重新用于储蓄和投资，这可以改变他们的生活。还有没有其他应用程序可以用来取消或退出订阅？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Okay. So, so as you do this, what you're doing right now is a real life example. So, if someone's listening to us, watching this, they're married, they've got kids, or they're single by themselves, this one exercise, my guess is there are many, many people listening that could find $50, $100, $200 a month that they could shut off and redirect that money to saving and investing and that could change their life. Are there other apps you can use and go to to figure out how to cancel or leave your subscription?

</details>

**[发言人]**: 是的，有。但这些应用程序大多数都需要付费，对吧？所以，你可以去，然后你就又回到了为应用程序付费。可能最受欢迎的两个应用程序是**Monarch**和**Ynab**。你也可以用你的**信用卡**来做这件事。嗯，**信用卡公司**在你的账单上做得越来越好，可以显示这些。再说一遍，我回到**苹果**的例子，因为**苹果**让关闭这些东西变得最简单。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: So there there are and most these apps you have to pay for, right? So like you can go to So then you're right back into paying for an app now. Probably the two popular most popular apps are **Monarch** and **Ynab**. You can also do this with your credit cards. Um the credit card comes doing a better job of showing it on your statements. And again, I go back to the **Apple** example because **Apple** makes it the easiest to shut these off.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 也许你们有些人每月会花**100美元**。所以，我算了每月**100美元**。它说如果你取消这些订阅并每月投资**100美元**，持续**40年**，年回报率约为**10%**，这大致是如果你现在将其投入一些大型科技**指数基金**所能获得的回报。那么**40年**后你拥有的总金额将是**63.2万美元**，这是一个惊人的改变人生的金额。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: Maybe some of you will be spending $100 a month. So, I did $100 a month. And it says if you invest if you sort of cancel those subscriptions and invest $100 per month for 40 years, an annual rate of return of about 10%, which is roughly what you get if you just put it into some of the big tech index funds at the moment. The total money you'll have in 40 years is $632,000, which is staggeringly life-changing amount of money.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 真是惊人。让我给人们一些非常具体的投资建议，对吧？他们仍然需要做自己的尽职调查，阅读招股说明书。是的，股市存在风险。但我首先要谈论和关注的是，这些都列在我的书中，因为我只是想给出，因为人们会问，什么是**指数基金**？我该买什么？看看**先锋总股票市场基金（Vanguard Total Stock Market Fund）**。代码是**VTI**。好的，这实际上是世界上最大的**指数基金**。现在这个基金里有数万亿美元。我在书中谈到了它。我查了一下**VTI**过去**10年**的年回报率是**14%**。每年**14%**。这个基金有**3500只**股票。你了解所有最大的美国股票。所以你不必弄清楚要买哪只股票。你购买这个基金，你购买一个**交易所交易的共同基金**，你就可以接触到**3500家**伟大的美国公司。我再给你一个我喜欢的**股票指数基金**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: It's staggering. And let me just give some very specific investment for people to consider, right? And they still need to do their own due diligence and read perspectuses. And yes, there's risk involved in the stock market. But the first one I would talk about and look at, and these are all listed in my book because I just want to give because people like, what's an index fund? What do I buy? Look at the **Vanguard Total Stock Market Fund**. The symbol is **VTI**. Okay, this this is actually the largest index fund in the world. There's trillions of dollars now in this fund. I talk about it in the book. I looked up the annual uh the annual returns of **VTI** the last 10 years have been 14%. 14% annually. This fund has 3500 stocks. You you know all the biggest US stocks. So you don't have to figure out what stock to buy. You buy this fund, you buy an exchange traded mutual fund, you have access to 3,500 great American companies. I'll give you another stock index fund. I love

</details>

**[发言人]**: 真的。你可以去**先锋基金**、**嘉信理财**、**富达**。这些基金，这是一个**ETF**，所以它随处可见。它是一只股票。如果你想弄清楚如何做到这一点，你现在正在听，我会怎么做呢？我会使用**ChatV**或**Gemini**，输入我刚才说的基金，然后问它我所在的国家如何投资这个基金？我需要使用什么应用程序？我需要使用什么网站？再说一遍，这不是投资建议。嗯，我猜听起来有点像，但是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: literally. You can go to **Vanguard**, **Schwab**, **Fidelity**. This funds, this is an **ETF**, so it's available everywhere. It's a stock. And if you want to figure out how to do this and you're listening right now, what I'd do is use **ChatV** or **Gemini** and put in the stock the the the fund that um has been said and ask it how do I invest in this in the country that I'm in? What app do I need to use? What website do I need to use? Again, this is not investment advice. Well, I guess it kind of sounds like it is, but

</details>

**[主持人]**: 嗯，但是，如果有人说：“好的，但我不在，我在**英国**。**英国**有什么**指数基金**涵盖**英国**的？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: Well, and but it's also like so like if someone says, "Okay, but I'm not I'm in um wherever I am. I'm in the UK. What's an index fund in the UK that covers the UK?"

</details>

**[发言人]**: 我会给你**VTI**的全球版本。所以，因为我拥有这些基金，所以我拥有这些基金。所以，**VTI**的全球版本是一个代码，我只会给你另一个**先锋基金**。

**[主持人]**: 当你说你拥有这些基金时，为了清楚起见，你是说你投资了它们？

**[主持人]**: When you say you own these funds, for clarity, you mean you've invested in them?

**[发言人]**: 是的，我把钱投入了这些**共同基金**。所以，这个其他基金，因为我希望我的个人资金投入股市。我是三分之一的全球投资和三分之二的美国投资。所以，我有很多全球**指数基金**。这个全球**指数基金**的代码是**VA**。好的。所以这是不包含美国股票的**先锋全球指数基金**。代码再次是**VA**。去年那个基金，它不会总是这样，因为全球投资长期以来一直表现不如美国。去年那个基金上涨了**35%**。去年，全球投资显著跑赢美国投资，美国投资市场平均上涨了**17%**。所以美国市场上涨了**17%**或更高，全球投资上涨了**30%**或更高。现在，**Stephen**，毫无疑问，总有一天我们会看到市场回调。当那一天到来时，你必须坚持下去，并每月自动投资。然后我将给你一个科技基金，因为每个人都想知道我应该投资什么，你知道，我应该投资**AI科技基金**吗？我的回答是，你不需要**AI科技基金**。你需要我一生中存在过的最好的科技基金。那就是**纳斯达克100 ETF（NASDAQ 100 ETF）**。它的代码是**QQQ**。所以去查一下，你知道，去你正在使用的任何地方查一下**QQQ**，阅读关于**纳斯达克**前**100只**股票的信息，以及**QQQ**的回报。我的意思是，实际上，我现在脑海中浮现的是，我认为它超过**20%**。嗯，但查一下**QQQ**过去**10年**的总回报率是多少。我可以告诉你，自从我把钱投入**QQQ**以来，它已经上涨了**十倍**。现在，市场一直令人难以置信，并且会有回调。这也是为什么我应该说，**Stephen**，因为我们甚至还没有解决这个问题。我不会到处告诉人们把所有的钱都投入股市。我也不认为年轻人应该把所有的钱都投入股市。我认为最大的神话之一是，当你年轻时，你应该承担很大的风险。让我再说一遍，因为它非常重要。所以，确保它能被理解。每个人都说当你年轻时，你应该承担风险。这个建议的问题是，今天二三十岁的人正在承担很大的风险。他们不仅仅把钱投入**指数基金**。他们把钱投入**迷因币**。他们把钱投入**迷因股票**。他们把钱投入**NFT**。他们在社交媒体和**TikTok**上观看人们进行日内交易。他们试图进入期权市场。他们真正想做的是**快速致富**。我能告诉你的是，作为房间里年纪较大的人，那些试图**快速致富**的人永远贫穷。当你年轻时，对你的钱承担太多风险的问题是，如果你做的一切都正确，比如，假设你关闭了所有的订阅，你每月节省**200美元**，但你把这**200美元**投入了一个垃圾投资，**10年**后你一无所获，你就会停止投资。

**[发言人]**: Yeah, I've got money in these mutual funds. So, this other fund because I have I want money my my personal money that's in the stock market. I am one-third global investments and I'm twothirds US investments. So, I have a lot of global index funds. This global index fund the symbol is **Va**. Okay. So this is the **Vanguard global index fund without US stock**. Symbol again is **VA**. That fund last year and it won't always be like this because global investments have underperformed the US for a long period of time. That fund last year was up 35%. Last year, global investments significantly outperformed the US investments and the US investment market was up on average of 17%. So the US markets were up 17% or higher and global investments were up 30% or higher. Now there will be a point in time, **Stephen**, without a shadow of a doubt that we will see a market pullback. And when that day comes, you have to stay the course and keep investing automatically monthly. And then I'm going to give you a tech fund because everybody wants to know what should I invest in that is, you know, should I invest in an **AI** tech fund? And my answer would be is you don't need an **AI** tech fund. You need the best tech fund that's existed in my lifetime. And that's the **NASDAQ 100 ETF**. The symbol for that is **QQQ**. So go and look up, you know, go into whatever you're using and go look up **QQQ**, read about the top 100 stocks in the **NASDAQ** and the returns for **QQQ**. I mean, actually, in the top of my mind right now, I can I think it's over 20%. Um, but look up what has the **QQQ** total return been for the last 10 years. I can tell you since I put money in **QQQ**, it's gone up tenfold. Now, the market's been unbelievable and there will be pullbacks. And that is also why I should say this, **Stephen**, because we haven't even addressed this. I don't run around telling people to put all their money in the stock market. I also don't think that young people should be putting all their money in the stock market. I think one of the greatest myths out there is that when you're young, you should take a lot of risk. Let me say that one more time because it's super important. So, make sure it sits. Everyone says when you're young, you should take risk. The problem with that advice is that today people in their 20s and their 30s are taking a lot of risk. They're not just putting money in index funds. They're putting money in meme coins. They're putting money in meme stocks. They're putting money in **NFTTS**. They're on social media and **Tik Tok** watching people day trade. They're trying to get into options. What they're really trying to do is get rich quick. All I can tell you is the older guy in the room here, people who try to get rich quick stay broke forever. And the problem with taking too much risk with your money when you're young is if you keep if you do everything right, like let's just say you're the you shut off all your subscriptions and you're saving $200 a month, but you put that $200 a month into a junk investment and you turn around in 10 years and you have nothing to show for it, you'll stop investing.

**[主持人]**: 看看**QQQ**的数据，这是**纳斯达克100指数**。它投资于美国**纳斯达克证券交易所**的**前100家**公司。

**[主持人]**: Looking at the **QQQ** data, so this is the **NASDAQ 100**. So this invests in the top 100 companies in America. in the **NASDAQ** stock exchange.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 从**2016年到2026年**，过去**10年**的年化回报率约为**19%**。该期间的总回报率约为**480%**。所以，如果**10年前**投资**1万美元**，今天大约价值**6万美元**，如果你什么都没做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: The returns over the last 10 years from 2016 to 2026, the annualized returns have been roughly 19%. The total return over that period has been roughly 480%. So, a $10,000 investment 10 years ago would now be worth approximately $60,000 today if you'd done nothing.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 那什么都没。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: Then nothing

</details>

**[发言人]**: 永远没有增加。过去**20年**的年化回报率，每年回报率为**15%**，该期间的总回报率为**1500%**。再说一遍，所以如果你**20年前**投入了**1万美元**，什么都没做，你今天大约会有**17万美元**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: ever added to it. Over the last 20 years, the annualized returns, the return every year has been 15% with a total return over that period of 1,500%. And again, so if you've added $10,000 to it 20 years ago and done nothing, you would have roughly $170,000 today.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 所以这就是你刚才做的美妙之处。你验证了我的建议。你查看了数据，现在你知道过去发生了什么，对吧？让我给你一个超级无聊的基金。我没有被**先锋基金**赞助。我只是在这里提供通用、普通的资料。查一下**先锋平衡基金（Vanguard Balanced Fund）**。所以，**先锋平衡基金**是**60%**股票和**40%**债券。顺便说一句，这是最典型的资产配置。股票和债券在世界上的区别。普通退休人员的投资组合大约是**60%**股票和**40%**债券。你查一下**先锋平衡基金**，你会发现这个基金自成立以来平均每年上涨超过**8%**。它是一种非常无聊的投资。所以如果有人说：“嗯，我不想**100%**投资股票。我只想更保守一点，但又想有一些股票风险敞口。”**先锋平衡基金**就是一个很好的例子。我把所有这些基金都列在《**The Automatic Millionaire**》中。我谈论最多的基金之一是所谓的**目标日期共同基金（target-dated mutual fund）**。我不知道你们有没有**401k计划**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: So here's the beauty of what you just did. You checked my my you checked my advice. You looked at the data and now you know what has been done in the past, right? Let me give you a super boring fund. I'm not sponsored by **Vanguard**. I'm just giving generic vanilla stuff here. Look up the **Vanguard balanced fund**. So, right, **Vanguard Balanced Fund**. And the **Vanguard Balance Fund** is 60% stocks and 40% bonds. That by the way is the most typical asset allocation. The difference between stocks and bonds in the world. The average retiree has a portfolio that's about 60% stock and 40% bonds. You look up the **Valangard balance fund** and what you're going to find is that fund has averaged over 8% annually since inception. It is as boring an investment as they come. So if someone says, "Well, I don't want to be 100% stocks. I just want to be I want to be more conservative, but I want some stock exposure. The **Vanguard balance fund** is a great example. I list all these funds in **the automatic millionaire**. One of the kind of funds I talk about the most is what's called a **targetdated mutual fund**. I don't know if you guys have you guys have a **401k plan**.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 我们有类似的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: We have something similar.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 好的。所以在美国，如果你有**401k计划**，你会发现在你打开**401k计划**时，你有所谓的**目标日期共同基金**。这是一个一站式的**共同基金**解决方案，可以让你一直投资到退休，它将分配在股票和债券之间，并且会随着你接近退休而自动**再平衡**。所以，当你年轻时，它会更多地投资股票，当你变老时，股票会减少。现在这些**目标日期共同基金**中有数万亿美元。**20年前**我写《**The Automatic Millionaire**》时，它才刚刚起步。这种自动化的投资解决方案改变了数百万美国人的投资游戏。这就是为什么现在有**2400万**百万富翁，这就是为什么现在退休账户中有**45万亿美元**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Okay. So in the US if if you have a **401k plan** what you're going to find when you open up your **401k plan** is you have what are called **targetdated mutual funds**. This is a onestop mutual fund solution to your investing all the way until you retire and it will be divided among stocks and bonds and it will be what's called rebalanced automatically as you get closer to retirement. So, it'll go from being more stocks when you're young, less stocks as you get older. There are trillions of dollars now in these **target date mutual funds**. When I wrote **the automatic miller** 20 years ago, was just getting started. This automatic solution to investing has changed the game of investing for millions of Americans. That's why there's 24 million millionaires and that's why there's now $45 trillion in retirement accounts.

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: So, why can it be everything?

</details>

**[发言人]**: 因为在现实世界中，**Stephen**，通常我们会嫁给我们的财务对立面。所以我总是开玩笑说，我以前为夫妻做很多研讨会，我会说世界上有两种人。一种人出生时手里就拿着计算器，他们天生就喜欢追踪所有钱的去向，他们喜欢预算，他们对投资非常兴奋。这是第一种人。另一种人喜欢购物，喜欢花钱。几乎不可避免地，这两种人会走到一起。现在，有时两个喜欢花钱的人会结婚。那会是一场灾难，因为他们最终会破产。那么，对于财务对立的夫妻，你该怎么办？这就是《**Smart Couples Finish Rich**》的由来。因为如果你嫁给了你的财务对立面，你们会一直为钱吵架。而为钱吵架是导致离婚的原因。它们是离婚的头号原因。真正的关键，也是我二十多年来一直在教导的，是让夫妻在金钱问题上达成共识的方法是，从你们的价值观开始。所以你们看看作为一对夫妻，你们最看重什么。你们暂时把钱放在一边。你们审视自己的价值观。对你们来说什么最重要。你们真正关心什么？你们谈论自己的价值观。然后你们围绕对你们来说真正最重要的事情制定一个财务计划。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Because here's what here's what happens in the real world, **Stephen**. Often we marry our financial opposite. So, I always joke like I used to do a lot of seminars for couples and I'd say there's two types of people that are born in the world. One person comes out literally with a calculator and they're born to track where all the money goes and they love to budget and they're super excited about investing. That's one kind of person. The other kind of person loves to shop, loves to spend money. Almost inevitably those two people hook up. Now, sometimes two people who like to spend money marry. That's a disaster because they end up broke. So now, what do you do about the couple that's got their financial opposites? That's what led to **smart couples finish**. Because if you are married to your financial opposite, you will fight about money all the time. And fights about money are what lead to divorce. They're the number one cause of divorce. The real key and what I've been teaching now for over two decades is the way you get couples on the same page when it comes to money is you start with your values. So you look at what do you really value most together as a couple. You put the money aside for a second. You go through your values. What's most important to you. What do you really care about? You talk about your values. And then you build a financial plan around what's really most important to you.

**[主持人]**: 你说夫妻会犯六个最糟糕的金钱错误。其中第一个是，没有决定谁负责什么。

**[发言人]**: Yeah.

**[发言人]**: 所以在一段关系中，通常一个人负责支付账单。好的，谁在管理钱？现在，我以前常说，每个家庭至少应该有一个人负责支付账单，如果另一个人管理钱，这意味着他们负责投资，你们仍然应该坐下来一起审查。随着我年龄的增长，我真正意识到这有多重要，因为我回到平均年龄是**59岁**这个事实。丧偶的平均年龄是**59岁**。我现在**59岁**了。我已经有三个最好的朋友去世了，都是男性，他们都在**57岁**之前去世了。所以，我谈论的所有这些统计数据，我都看到了它们变成了现实。我将特别对女性说，请大声清楚地听我说，但这对于男性也很重要。你需要问自己的问题，这很难听。你需要问自己的问题是，如果你的伴侣今天去世了，你需要知道关于财务的什么？答案是一切。那么这意味着什么？一切。这意味着你需要知道钱在哪里。他有没有旧的**401k计划**里的钱？他有没有**IRA账户**里的钱？他有没有银行账户里的钱？获取账户密码在哪里？遗嘱在哪里？你知道，今天听我们说话的**10个人中**有**6个人**没有遗嘱。你必须有遗嘱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: So often in a relationship, one person pays the bills. Okay, who's managing the money? Now, I used to say in every household there should be at least one person that's paying the bills and if the other person is managing the money, meaning that they're in charge of investments, that you still get together and go through it. As I've gotten older, I've really realized how important this is because I go back to the fact that the average age is 59. Average age of widowhood is 59. I'm 59 now. I've had three best friends already pass away, all men, and they passed away before they were 57. So, all these statistics that I talk about, I'm seeing them come true. And I will tell especially to the women, hear me loud, hear me on this loud and clear, but this is important for the men, too. The question you need, this is hard to hear. The question you have to ask yourself is if your partner died today, what would you need to know about the finances? And the answer is everything. Now, what does that mean? Everything. That means you would need to know where is the money. Does he have money in an an old **401k plan**? Does he have money in **IRA account**? Does he have money in a bank account? Where are the passwords to get into the accounts? Where's the will? You know, six out of 10 people listening to us today don't have a will. You have to have a will

**[发言人]**: 任何年龄。如果你，特别是如果你处于一段关系中，你必须有遗嘱。如果你有孩子，你必须有遗嘱。有**人寿保险**吗？你知道，今天很多有孩子的人没有**人寿保险**，也没有资产。你至少应该购买**100万到200万美元**的**定期寿险**。超级便宜。保护你的家人。你必须进行演练，对吧？就像我们今天坐飞机来到这里。飞机起飞前做的第一件事就是告诉你紧急情况下该怎么做。面罩会掉下来。你会把它戴在脸上。好的。你登上游轮。他们做的第一件事就是告诉你如果游轮有问题该怎么做。你会去乘坐这些**救生艇**。你需要为你的家庭进行财务方面的**消防演练**。我差点死了，那已经是四年前的事了。我妻子发现我脸朝下，昏过去了。我被送到了**佛罗伦萨**的医院。嗯，我昏迷了四天。我在医院住了**17天**。我得了**脑膜炎**。当我醒来时，就像电影一样，我躺在那里。我的意思是，我躺在医院里。医生看着我。医生说：“你知道你叫什么名字吗？”我说：“我叫**David**。”他说：“很好。”他问：“你的姓氏是？”我说：“是**Bach**。”他说：“你知道你在哪里吗？”我说：“是的，我在**米兰**。我刚做了脚踝手术。”因为我两周前做了脚踝手术，两周前。他说：“不，不，你在**圣玛丽亚诺维拉**。你在**重症监护室（ICU）**。我们现在正在治疗你的**脑膜炎**，但既然你睁开了眼睛，你就会没事了。你现在安全了。”然后他们把我妻子带了进来。他们说：“你知道她叫什么名字吗？”我开玩笑说：“她叫**Rebecca**。”她问：“谁？”我说：“亲爱的，我住院了还能耍小聪明呢。是**Alatia**。”她开始尖叫，大喊大叫，她说：“哦，天哪，哦，天哪，他没事了。”但**Stephen**，事实是我并不好，因为当你得了**脑膜炎**，你的大脑会肿胀。所以我记不起事情了。我记不起银行账户的密码了。我记不起手机号码的密码了，我的手机密码。我出院后做的一件事，因为我总是管理钱，我对妻子说：“我们要雇一个财务顾问，你必须参与其中。”我们昨天实际上进行了年度账户审查。因为我告诉夫妻，你们必须进行年度账户审查，要么一起进行，如果你有财务顾问，至少要和你的财务顾问一起进行。我不想取消预约，因为即使你们邀请我来这里，我想，我还是要保留预约。我们今天早上会飞到这里。所以，再次，在**摩根士丹利**工作了九年，并担任财务顾问，我见过太多夫妻没有这样做，包括悲哀的是，**Stephen**，我父亲最近去世了。我父亲一生都在从事资金管理业务。所以他管理钱，我妈妈没有参与。当我父亲去世时，我们不得不像我的书里写的那样，介入并帮助我妈妈处理所有事情。现在，她很幸运。她有两个孩子都在这个行业，但她没有。我妈妈就是一个活生生的例子，她很容易被利用。所以，学习理财的时机是在问题发生之前。如果你认真对待《**Smart Couples Finish Rich**》，**Stephen**，它旨在成为两个人共同的路线图，你们可以坐下来，一章一章地一起阅读这本书，从整理你们的财务信息开始，把所有东西都放入文件夹，开始对话，然后谈论你们的价值观，然后谈论你们的梦想，然后进入，嗯，你们想分享什么？你知道，你有一个非常复杂的，我不知道你所有的东西，但我关注你多年了。正如我告诉你的，我是你的粉丝。我有你的书。我看了你的播客。我听你说了好几年了。随着你的事业扩张，你的生活变得越来越复杂。天哪，如果明天你出了什么事。

**[发言人]**: At any age. If you, especially if you're in a relationship, you have to have a will. If you have kids, you have to have a will. Is there life insurance? You know, so many people today who have children don't have life insurance and they don't have assets. You should at least get a million to$2 million term policy. Super inexpensive. Protect your family. You have to run the drill, right? Like we got on a plane, we flew here today. The first thing they do on a plane before you take off is they talk to you about what to do in case of emergency purposes. The mask's going to come down. You're going to put it on your face. Okay. You get on a cruise boat. The first thing they do is talk about what you're going to do if the cruise boat's got a problem. You're going to go get in these emergency boats. You need to run the fire drill for your family on finances. I almost died like it's now been four years ago. I uh my wife found me face down, passed out. I was brought to the hospital in **Florence**. Um I was in a coma for four days. I was in the hospital for 17. I had menitis. When I came out of just like a movie, I'm laying down. I mean, I'm laying down in the hospital. Doctor's looking over me. Doctor says, "Do you know what your name is?" I said, "It's **David**." He said, "Very good." He goes, "Your last name is?" I said, "It's **Boach**." He says, "Do you know where you are?" I go, "Yeah, I'm in **Milan**. I just had an ankle surgery." Because I had had an ankle surgery two weeks prior, two two weeks before that. And he says, "No, no, you're you're in **Santa Maria Nolla**. You're in the **ICU**. Uh we're treating you right now for menitis, but now that you've opened up your eyes, you're going to be you're going to be okay. You're safe now." And then they brought my wife in. They said, "Do you know what her name is?" I and I made a joke. I said, "It's **Rebecca**." She was like, "Who?" I go, "Honey, I can still be a smartass in the hospital. It's **Alatia**." And she starts screaming and yelling and she's like, "Oh my god, oh my god, he's okay." But **Stephen**, the truth was I wasn't okay because when you get men and judges, you get brain swelling. So I couldn't remember things. I couldn't remember my passwords to the to the bank account. I didn't know the passwords to my phone number anymore, to my phone. One of the things I did when I came out of the hospital, because I always manage the money, is I said to my wife, "We're going to hire a financial advisor and you have to be involved in what's going on." We actually had yesterday our annual account review. Because I tell couples, you got to have an annual account review either together and if you have a financial adviser at a minimum with your financial adviser. And I didn't want to cancel the appointment because I was, even though you guys invited me to come here, I'm like, I'm keeping the appointment. We'll fly here to flute this morning. And so again, having worked at, you know, **Morgan Stanley** for nine years and been a financial adviser, I've seen too many couples not do this, including sadly **Stephen**, my dad just recently passed away. And my dad was in the money management business his whole life. So he managed the money and my mom was not involved. And when my dad passed away, we had to just like my book, step in and help my mom with everything. Now, she's lucky. She's got two kids in the business, but she didn't. My mom was just a ripe waiting example of somebody who could be taken advantage of. So, the time to learn about money is before there's a problem. If you took **smart couples finish** honestly **Stephen** that you it's it's designed to be a a roadmap for two people together where you can sit down and go through this book chapter by chapter together starting with just organizing your financial information putting everything into file folders starts the conversation and then talking about your values then talking about your dreams then going into well what what do you want to share you know you have a very comp I don't know all your stuff, but I've followed you for years. As I told you, I'm a fan of yours. I've got your book. I've watched your podcast. I've listened to you now for years. As your business is expanding, your life is getting more complicated. God forbid something happens to you tomorrow.

**[主持人]**: 是的。那会是一场噩梦。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: Yeah. It'd be a [ __ ] nightmare.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 她是你的未婚妻。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: And she's your fiance.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: Yeah.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 她甚至不知道从何开始。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: She wouldn't even know where to start.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 而且我不知道她会知道找谁。所以，这是一次值得的对话。就像我刚在节目中遇到这个人，我不知道也许我们真的需要让你参与进来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: And I don't know if she would know who to call. So, it's a worthwhile conversation. like I just had this guy in the show and I don't know maybe maybe we really need to like need to involve you a little bit.

**[发言人]**: 我刚才看了一些数据，它说根据**富达投资（Fidelity Investments）****2021年**的一项研究，近**40%**的夫妻甚至无法识别他们的伴侣赚多少钱。它说在**财务不忠**方面，**Bankrate**和**CreditCards.com**的调查一致发现，高达**40%**的成年人表示他们保守了财务秘密，即向他们的伴侣隐瞒现金、银行对账单和债务。所以这几乎是一半。你之前也提到了这一点，那就是**首席财务官（CFO）**动态。在许多家庭中，一方配偶担任**首席财务官**。研究表明，大约**50%**的夫妻中，非管理配偶对家庭总共有多少钱知之甚少。他们不知道钱在哪里，也不知道密码。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: I was just looking at some of the data here and it says that in terms of income ignorance according to a 2021 study by **Fidelity Investments** nearly 40% of couples could not even identify how much their partner earned. It says in terms of financial infidelity, surveys from **bank rate** and **creditcards.com** consistently find that up to 40% of adults share that they have kept financial secrets which is hiding cash, hiding bank statements and hiding debts that they have from their romantic partner. So that's almost half and you pointed at this earlier on which is the **CFO** dynamic. In many households, one spouse acts as the chief financial officer. And research indicates that roughly 50% of couples um have a non-managing spouse who has little to no idea how much money the family have total. They don't know where it is and they don't know the passwords.

**[发言人]**: 这听起来可能很可怕，可能令人望而生畏。然而，我可以告诉你，每天，那些真正做我们谈论的这些基本事情的人，一旦你开始做，你会感觉好很多。你会立刻感觉更好。你不必从没有储蓄到拥有**100万美元**才能感觉更好。如果你只是开始自动储蓄一些钱，**先支付自己**。你做出那个决定的那一刻，你就会感觉更好。你去关闭一些订阅费，就像你刚才看到的那样。你做到的那一刻，你就会感觉更好。这简直就像一块**财务肌肉**。当你开始采取行动时，你就会开始建立这块**财务肌肉**。是行动改变了你的生活。我总是说我写了所有这些书。如果一个人买了一本书，读了它却什么都不做，那么我只是一种娱乐形式。如果你听了一个关于金钱的播客，却什么都不做，那么我们又是一种娱乐形式。我今天做这个播客的目的，我为什么立即坐飞机来到这里和你一起做这个，是因为我想今天改变某个人的生活。我总是采取这样的方法，我想一次改变一个人的生活。有时我分享的事情很难听，但我也知道它们会唤醒人们。你这本书里有一句非常棒的名言。我今天给我儿子看了这个。我手里拿着，对于那些看不到我的人，我手里拿着**Steven**的书《**A Diary of the CEO**》，这本书也卖出了数百万册。这是你书第**233页**上的名言。我想知道你是否还记得你的名言，因为有时你会忘记它们，对吧？如果你想在事业、人际关系和生活中获得长期成功，你必须尽快更好地接受不舒服的真相。当你拒绝接受不舒服的真相时，你就是选择接受一个不舒服的未来。这句话中唯一没有提到的是金钱。我们谈论的一切都是，我告诉你，你一生中将工作**9万小时**。如果你不**先支付自己**，并且一无所获，那么不舒服的真相就是你将一贫如洗。我们还没有谈到全球问题、政府问题和债务。为什么你现在比以往任何时候都更需要照顾好自己的财务？因为未来即将发生根本性的变化。我将暂时两面兼顾。第一，我相信未来十年，毫无疑问，将是我们一生中积累财富的最佳机会。**人工智能**将创造我们从未见过的巨大财富。就像你看看去年股市的回报，它们是**人工智能**的结果。正在发生的是，**人工智能**正在使公司比以往任何时候都更盈利、更高效。缺点是人们正在失业，对吧？你节目中有嘉宾，包括**Tony Robbins**，谈论过这个问题，而且会有更多的失业。所以有些人会变得更富有，然后很多其他人将面临挑战。但我们还有一个没有充分讨论的问题，那就是政府的**安全网**。所有这些在美国创建的**安全网**，**社会保障**、**医疗保险**、**医疗补助**、**失业保险**，你可以逐一查看每个国家。所有这些都被称为**福利计划**，这是一个花哨的词，意思是政府向你做出了承诺。很多人依赖那个承诺，但没有足够的钱来兑现这些承诺。所以，比如在美国，你拿**社会保障**来说。现在平均的**社会保障**支票是**1900美元**。钱不多，但大约有**6000万**美国人依赖这笔钱。在美国，**社会保障**，这是政府数据，不是我说的。你可以在线查到所有这些。政府告诉我们，在**2033年**，也就是很快，**社会保障**将资金不足，他们将不得不削减福利。现在，他们谈论的是削减**20%**的福利。对于很多美国人来说，这将是一个真正的问题。每个国家都有这个问题，因为人们寿命更长。政府的债务比以往任何时候都多。我在这里告诉你，这是一个老生常谈的说法，但没有人会来拯救你。你必须自救，你必须比以往任何时候都更认真地对待你的个人财务福祉。如果你做到了，你就会处于很好的状态。如果你不这样做，你将依赖一个正在崩溃的系统。

**[发言人]**: It can sound scary. It can sound intimidating. And yet, I can tell you every day, people who actually kind of do this basic stuff that we've talked about, once you start to do it, you feel a lot better. You feel better instantly. You don't you don't have to go from having no savings to having a million dollars to feel better. If you just start automatically saving some money, paying yourself first. The moment you make that decision, you'll feel better. You go and you turn off some subscription fees like you just looked at. The moment you do that, you'll feel better. It's literally like a financial muscle. You start to build this financial muscle when you start to take action. It is action that changes your life. I always say I wrote all these books. If a person buys a book, reads it and doesn't do anything, then I was a form of entertainment. If you listen to a podcast on money and you don't do something, then we were again a form of entertainment. My purpose for doing this podcast today, why I got on a plane and flew out here immediately to do this with you was I want to try to change somebody's life today. I've always taken the approach of like I want to change a person's life one person at a time. And sometimes the things I share are hard to hear, but I also know they wake people up. You had this great great quote in this book. I was showing this today to my son. I'm holding, for those of you who can't see me, I'm holding **Steven's** book, **A Diary of the CEO**, which has also sold millions of copies. And this is your quote on page 233. I wonder if you remember your quotes because sometimes you forget them, right? If you want long-term success in business, relationships, and life, you have to get better at accepting uncomfortable truths as fast as possible. When you refuse to accept an uncomfortable truth, you are choosing to accept an uncomfortable future. The one thing that wasn't in this quote was money. And everything we're talking about is I'm like, you're gonna work 90,000 hours over your lifetime. If you don't pay yourself first and you have nothing to show for it, the uncomfortable truth is you will be broke. We haven't talked about um global issues and government issues and debt. Why do you have to take care of yourself financially right now more than ever before? Because the future is about to radically change. And I will talk out of both sides of my mouth for a second. Number one, I believe the next 10 years, hands down, will be the greatest opportunity to build wealth in our lifetime. **AI** is create going to create so much wealth that we've never seen anything like it. Like when you look at the returns in the stock market from last year, they're a result of **AI**. What's happening is **AI** is making companies more profitable and more productive than they've ever been. The downside is people are losing their jobs, right? You've had people on the show including **Tony Robbins** talking about this and there are going to be a lot more of those job losses. So some people are going to get much wealthier and then a whole lot of other people are going to have a challenge. But there's another problem that we we're not talking enough about and that is the safety nets of governments. All these safety nets that were created in the US, **Social Security**, **Medicare**, **Medicaid**, unemployment, you can go to through every single country. All of these things are called entitlement programs, which is a fancy word for saying the government made a promise to you. And a whole lot of people are dependent on that promise and there's not enough money to pay for those promises. So like in the US, you take social security. The average social security check right now is $1,900. Not a lot of money, but about 60 million Americans depend on that amount of money. In the US, **Social Security**, this is government data, not me. you can do all this stuff online. The government is telling us that in 2033, that's around the corner, the **Social Security** is going to be underfunded and they're going to have to cut the benefits. Now, what they're talking about is cutting the benefits by 20%. You have a lot of Americans that that's going to be a real problem for every country's got this issue because people are living longer. Governments have more debt than they've ever had. I am here to tell you, it's a cliche term, but no one's coming to save you. It's you're gonna have to save yourself and you're gonna have to take your personal financial well-being more seriously now than ever before. And if you do, you will be in great shape. If you don't, you will be dependent on a system that is buckling.

**[发言人]**: 你书中的一点，我认为是夫妻常犯的六个错误中的第六点，是**拖延还清抵押贷款**。你这是什么意思？我有一个朋友联系我，嗯，问了这个问题。他们说：“**Stephen**，我得到了一些现金。”我想是通过遗产。我应该还清我的抵押贷款，还是应该投资股市中的**标普500指数基金**或其他什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: One of the things in your I think it's the sixth point of the six things that couples get wrong is waiting too long to pay off the mortgage. What do you mean by that? I actually had a friend contact me um and asked this. They said, "**Stephen**, I've got some cash that that's been given to me." I think through an inheritance. Should I pay off my mortgage or should I go invest in the stock market in the **S&P 500** or something else?

</details>

**[主持人]**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: Yeah.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 我不知道该说什么，因为我不是财务顾问。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: And I didn't know what to say because I'm not a financial adviser.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 所以，如果你打电话给我，你说：“**David**，我该怎么办？”我会说：“**Stephen**，你的抵押贷款利率是多少？”然后你会说：“嗯，**David**，我五年前办的抵押贷款，利率是**2.5%**。”我会说：“好的，那是一个非常低的利率，**Stephen**。你知道吗？你现在可以把钱存入**货币市场账户**，赚得更多。所以也许你不需要急着尽快还清。”但如果你的抵押贷款利率是**6%**、**7%**或**8%**，那就不需要考虑了。我能告诉你的关于提前还清抵押贷款的最重要的事情实际上非常简单。以下是几种方法。如果你每年多支付一笔抵押贷款，你就可以把一个**30年**的抵押贷款，根据利率，提前五、六、七年还清。所以，你可以在线查询，你可以运行一个计算器。今天，你甚至不需要计算器。你只需提出问题。你输入你的抵押贷款。你告诉**Gemini**，这是我的抵押贷款金额。这是我的抵押贷款还款额。如果我每年多支付一笔，我会提前多少年还清？我会节省多少钱？你会看到那个数字。当人们看到白纸黑字的数字时，他们会说：“我必须这样做。”现在，关键是：让那笔付款自动化。你让你的付款自动化的最简单方法是，要么在年底多支付一笔，要么将你的抵押贷款还款额增加**10%**。所以，如果你的抵押贷款还款额是**1000美元**，那就每月支付**1100美元**的抵押贷款，并告诉银行你想把这笔钱加到本金上。当人们这样做时，他们需要确保这笔钱确实是在偿还本金。另一种方法是**双周抵押贷款支付计划**，你把你的抵押贷款分成两半，每两周支付一半。这也会让你提前还清抵押贷款。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: So, if you called me up and you said, "**David**, what what should I do?" I'd go, "**Stephen**, what's the rate on your mortgage?" Then you'd say, "Well, **David**, I got a mortgage 5 years ago and it's 2 and a half%." And I'd say, "Okay, well that's a really low rate, **Stephen**. You know what? You can put the money in a money market account right now and make more than that. So maybe you don't need to rush to pay it off as fast as possible." But if you've got a mortgage at six or seven or eight%, it's a no-brainer. The biggest thing I can tell you about paying down your mortgage early is actually really simple. Here's ways to do it. If you make one extra payment a year on a mortgage, you'll take a 30-year mortgage and you'll pay it off, depends on the rate, five, six, seven years sooner. So, you can go online, you can run a calculator. Today, you don't even need calculator. You just run the question. You put in your mortgage. You tell **Gemini**, here's the size of my mortgage. Here's my mortgage payment. If I make an extra payment a year, how many how many years faster will I pay it off? And how much will I save? And you'll see the number. When people see the number in black and white, they go, "I've got to do that." Now, here's the key. Make that payment automatic. The easiest way you make your payment automatic is either make one extra payment at the end of the year or take your mortgage payment and increase it by 10%. So, if your mortgage payment is $1,000, make an $1,100 a month mortgage payment and tell the bank you want to add that to the principal. When people do that, they need to make sure though that money is actually paying down the principal. And another way to do that is a bi-weekly mortgage payment plan where you take your mortgage, you split in half, you pay half every two weeks. That'll also pay your mortgage off early.

**[主持人]**: **婚前协议**。我订婚了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: Prenuptual agreements. I'm engaged.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Yep.

</details>

**[主持人]**: 我应该签**婚前协议**吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: Should I be getting a prenup?

</details>

**[发言人]**: 所以，我会告诉任何即将结婚的人：第一，如果你们的收入不相同，你们应该签**婚前协议**。第二，如果你们都有不错的收入，你们应该签**婚前协议**。第三，如果你三十多岁，你应该签**婚前协议**。你永远不会在没有合同的情况下开展业务。婚姻是最终的合同。就是这样。现在，签**婚前协议**浪漫吗？不。关系中是否通常会有一个人不喜欢签**婚前协议**？是的。我认识很多女性今天想要**婚前协议**，而丈夫不想要。这取决于谁在赚钱。但关于**婚前协议**，我要说的是：你需要一个律师。她需要一个律师。你不能在结婚前才去签**婚前协议**。当人们那样做时，那些**婚前协议**会被扔进垃圾桶，因为他们会声称并争辩说，我在婚礼前签署这份协议是受到了极大的不当影响。即使有免责声明，那些协议也会被推翻。你们双方都需要律师。**婚前协议**通常就像一场谈判。你可能会了解你的伴侣很多不总是美好的事情。我不是说你，但一个人在签**婚前协议**时可能会了解他们的伴侣很多不总是美好的事情。一旦**婚前协议**完成，如果它是一份合理的**婚前协议**，它就会被归档。它不会再被查看。除非有一天你需要把它拿出来，否则它不会有任何影响。这适用于第一次婚姻。好的，如果你是第二次或第三次婚姻，并且你有孩子，有监护权问题，以及对你第一任妻子的抚养费。你绝对需要一份**婚前协议**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: So, I would tell anyone who's getting married, number one, if your incomes are not the same, you should get a prenup. Number two, if you both have good incomes, you should get a prenup. Number three, if you're in your 30s, you should get a prenup. You would never go into a business without a contract. Marriage is the ultimate contract. It just is. Now, is it romantic to do a prenuptual agreement? No. Does one person in the relationship typically not like the doing a prenup? Yes. I know a lot of women today who want prenups and the husbands don't want them. It's whoever's making the money. But I will say this about prenups. You need a lawyer. She needs a lawyer. You cannot go and do a prenup right before you get married. When people do that, those prenups get thrown out the window because they will claim and say and have an argument for, I was under extremely undue influence to sign this agreement before the wedding. And those agreements get thrown out even if there's disclaimer language. And both of you need attorneys. And prenuptual agreements can often be like a negotiation. And you can learn a lot about your partner that it's not always pretty. I'm not saying you, but one can learn a lot about their partner that's not always pretty when you do a prenuptual agreement. And once the prenuptual agreement is done, if it's a reasonable prenuptual agreement, it goes in a file. It doesn't get looked at again. And it won't matter unless the day comes that you need to pull it out. And that's for a firsttime marriage. Okay, you're a second time marriage or a third time marriage and you've got kids and custody issues and and and support for your first wife. You definitely need a prenup.

### 金钱的工具性与人生梦想

**[主持人]**: 我们最应该谈论但没有谈论的最重要的事情是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[主持人]**: What is the most important thing we should have talked about that we didn't talk about?

</details>

**[发言人]**: **Stephen**，我们今天谈了很多关于金钱的事情，但金钱只是一个工具。所以，我们实际上没有太多机会谈论的是，仅仅使用金钱来解放自己，过上你最好的生活。你不需要有钱才能过上你最好的生活。再说一遍，金钱只是一个工具。那么，生活中最重要的是什么？我将说一些人们都知道的事情。**健康**。我开始关注你是因为你做了所有关于健康的节目。**爱**。人们对爱抓得太紧了。**感恩**。始终对你所拥有的生活心存感激。**友谊**。完全爱你的朋友。最后一件事情是**乐趣**。你知道，我认为人们在生活中走到某个点，他们停止了设计自己的生活。我的祖母常说，你必须梦想它，设计它，然后去做它。她说，你会时间不够的。所以我想对任何人说的是，你现在拥有这个美丽的时刻。你想要什么？从今天开始为此努力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: **Stephen**, we've talked a lot about money today, but money is just a tool. So, what we actually haven't got to talk a lot about is using money just to free yourself to live your best life. And you don't have to have money to live your best life. Again, money is just a tool. So, what's most important in life? I'm going to say things that people know. Health. You I started following you because of all the shows you did on health. Love. People hold on to love way too much. Gratitude. Being consistently grateful for the life you have. Friendship. loving your friends fully and the la last thing is fun. You know, I think people go through life and at some point they stop designing their life. My grandmother used to say, you got to dream it, design it, and do it. And she's like, you're going to run out of time. So what I would say to anybody is like this is you've got this one beautiful moment in time where you're here. What do you want? And start working on that today.

**[发言人]**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**[发言人]**: Yeah.

</details>

**[发言人]**: 你在这次对话中多次提到他。如果有人问我，除了我的祖母和父亲之外，我生命中最伟大的导师和影响者是谁，那就是**Tony Robbins**。所以我在**90年代初**参加了**Tony Robbins**的研讨会，那时他还在用录音带做电视购物广告。我参加了他在**夏威夷**教授的一个项目。他有一家大酒店叫**Yaloa**。他做了一个练习。这就像我昨天才记得一样。他对我们所在的房间说，我们房间里大概有一千人。他说：“你们中有多少人有一个正在努力实现的梦想？”我们都有梦想，所以他让我们进入巅峰状态，让我们为梦想努力。然后他问：“你们中有多少人认为自己**10年**后还会活着？”每个人都说：“是的，我**10年**后还会活着。”他说：“太好了。那么我有一个问题要问你。你**10年**后还会活着，并且为你的梦想努力了吗？希望你做对了，做了我教你做的一切，你知道，模仿大师，让自己处于巅峰状态，学会了模式识别。你有没有在**10年**后，经历了你的梦想，也许实现了它？还是你只是老了**10年**，却让你的梦想死去了？”他让这句话停在那里，然后让我们分成**10人一组**，分享我们各自的梦想。所以我们都把它写在纸上。所以我分享了我的梦想，我这个年轻的财务顾问小伙子。我分享了我的梦想是写一本名为《**Smart Women Finish Rich**》的书，并教导**100万**女性聪明理财，这样她们就能保护自己，教导她们的孩子，并帮助她们的家庭。我的心砰砰直跳，**Stephen**。我正在和**10个**陌生人分享这个想法。然后我们回到房间，他说：“怎么样？你们都准备好了吗？”他让我们回到巅峰状态。**10分钟后**，一个女人走过来，拍了拍我的肩膀，她说：“我刚听说了你的梦想。我叫**Vicki**。我参与了**Tony**的最后两本书。如果你想写你的书，你需要一个**图书提案**。你写过书，你知道的。她说，我可以帮你写**图书提案**。”我雇了她。我开始写那个**图书提案**。后来，我去找了**Tony**的同一个经纪人，**Jan Miller**。她成了我的经纪人。他写了一封求职信。我得到了一个图书合同，然后我开始努力帮助数百万人。这一切都始于**Tony Robbins**的研讨会。我回到我的祖母，对吧？梦想它，设计它，然后去做它。他给了我实现这些的生活技能。我将告诉你一些关于**Tony**的事情，因为你知道，你在所有这些节目中都看到**Tony**，人们会问：“**Tony**是真的吗？”**Stephen**，如果我和你在一起，我给**Tony**发短信，**Tony**有很多这样的朋友，**Tony**会立刻回复我。**Tony**是真的。我刚去了**德国**，带我**22岁**的大儿子**Jack**去看了他**9月**的**UPW**。这让我热泪盈眶，因为我希望**Jack**在没有我的情况下体验。所以他，你知道，感谢**Tony**坐在前排。我在第三天他处于巅峰状态时进去了，我进去看着他，你知道，我基本上和他同龄，我想，天哪，你不知道。我的意思是，我进去给了他一个拥抱，我说，你根本不知道。你正在看到的这种经历，你今天正在学习的东西，如果你使用这些东西，它将改变你的生活。这就是**Tony**的力量。人们会说，你知道，无论是你的播客、你的活动、**Tony**的活动、我的书，我们都只是**催化剂**。但上帝，上帝给了你一颗种子和一个梦想。当我们成为**催化剂**时，就像，看，去这样做。听听那个声音。无论你的上帝是谁，你听到你自己说，我有一个梦想。如果我只剩下**10年**生命，我真的不想带着那个梦想死去。那就是你要去努力实现的梦想。

**[发言人]**: You've referenced him several times in this conversation. If someone were to ask me who was the greatest mentor and the greatest influence in my life besides my grandmother and my father, it's **Tony Robbins**. So I went to **Tony Robbins** seminars in the early 90s back in the day when he had an infomercial with audio cassettes. And I went to a program that he taught in **Hawaii**. He had this big hotel called the **Yaloa**. And he did it he did an exercise. This is so I it's like I remember like this yesterday. He said to this the room we were in and there were I don't know a thousand of us in this room. He said, "How many of you have a dream that you're not working on?" And we all we all had dreams like and so he got us into a peak state and he had us work on our dreams. And then he asked the question, "How many of you think you're going to be alive in 10 years?" Everyone's like, "Yeah, I'm going be alive in 10 years." He's like, "Great. So I got a question for you. Are you going to be alive in 10 years having worked on your dream? Hopefully gotten it right, done all the things I've taught you to do, you know, modeled the masters, got yourself in peak state, learned the pattern recognition. Have you gotten 10 years older having gone through your dreams and maybe got it? Or did you just get 10 years over 10 years older and you let your dream die? you let your dream die and the room he just let that sit and then he had us go off in groups of 10 and share our individual dream. So we'd all written it down on paper. So I shared that my dream and this young kid financial adviser I'm a guy. I shared my dream was to write a book called **Smart Women Finish Rich** and teach a million women to be smart with money so they could protect themselves, teach their kids, and help their family. My heart's pounding, **Stephen**. I'm sharing this idea with 10 strangers. And then we go back into the room and he's like, "How'd that go? Are you guys all ready?" Gets us back in a peak state. 10 minutes later, a woman comes, taps me on the shoulder, and she says, "I just heard about your dream. My name's **Vicki**. I've worked on **Tony's** last two books. If you want to do your book, you're gonna need a book proposal. You've done books, you know this. She's like, I can help you write a book proposal. I hired her. I started working on that book proposal. Later, I would go after the same agent that **Tony** has, **Jan Miller**. She'd become my agent. He'd write a cover letter. I'd get a book deal, and I'd start working to help millions of people. It started at a **Tony Robbins** seminar. And I go back to my grandmother, right? Dream it, design it, and do it. He gave me the life skills to do that. And I will tell you something about **Tony** because you know, you see **Tony** on all these shows and people go, "Is **Tony** the real deal?" I **Stephen**, if I if I was with you and I send **Tony** a text and I and **Tony** has a lot of friends like this, **Tony** gets right back to me. **Tonyy's** the real deal. I just went to **Germany** and took my older son **Jack** who's 22 to see him do **UPW** in September could bring tears to my eyes because I wanted **Jack** to have the experience without me there. So he was, you know, bless **Tony** sitting in the front row. I came in on day three when he was in the peak state and I came in and I watched him, you know, I was basically his age and I thought, God, you don't, you know, I went in, I gave him a hug and I'm like, you just don't even know. This is just this experience that you're seeing, what you're learning today, if you use this stuff, it will change your life. That's the power of **Tony**. And people go, you know, whatever it is, your podcast, your events, **Tony's** events, my books, we're just catalysts. But God God gave you a seed and a dream. And when we're the catalyst for like, look, go do this. Listen to that voice. Whoever your God is, that soul that you hear yourself saying, I have a dream. If I only had 10 years left to live, I would really hate to die with that dream inside me. That's the dream you go work on.

**[发言人]**: 从那时起，你确实做到了。你通过书籍、播客、研讨会、新闻通讯以及数千次媒体露面，教育了数亿人如何做到这一点。如何实现**财务自由**，追求梦想，掌控自己的金钱，从而过上命中注定的生活。这是一件不可思议的事情。你的书在全球销量近**1000万册**。我相信你很快就会达到这个数字。嗯，我想你永远不会看到这给多少人的生活带来了影响，以及你因此改变了他们及其子孙后代的财务未来，就像你的祖母为你和你的家人所做的那样。我强烈建议大家去听那一集。我实际上会把它链接在下面。所以如果你还没有听**Tony Robbins**的那一集，如果你现在还在听，那将是一个很好的下一步。但是，嗯，**David**，我非常感谢你的到来，嗯，你对金钱这个话题提出了一个非常有趣且不同的视角，这很难得，但非常非常重要，我希望它能对很多人产生影响。我们有一个结束传统，你知道，嗯，我们会问下一位嘉宾上一个嘉宾留下的问题，留给你的问题是很有趣的。如果你拥有所有你需要的钱来支持自己和家人，没有任何财务担忧，你会从事什么工作或职业？或者说，你会把时间花在什么上面？

**[发言人]**: And since then, you've done exactly that. You've educated hundreds of millions of people through your books, through podcast, seminars, newsletters, and thousands of media appearances on how to do exactly that. How to get financially free, pursue their dreams, get hold of their money so that they can live the life that is um destined for them. And that is an incredible thing. And you've sold almost 10 million copies of your books worldwide. I'm sure you're going to hit that number at some point soon. And uh I guess you'll never get to see the impact that that's had on so many people's lives and how you've therefore changed the trajectory of their financial future and their kids and their kids and their kids like your grandmother did for you and your family. I'd highly recommend everybody go and listen to that episode. I'm actually going to link it below. So if you haven't listened to the episode with **Tony Robbins**, that's a great next thing to do if you're still listening now. But uh **David**, I wanted to thank thank you so much for coming and uh you present a really interesting different perspective on the subject of money which is is hard to find. It's rare um but it's very very very important and I'm hopefully it'll be consequential for many. We have a closing tradition as you know um where we ask the next guest the question left by the last and the question left for you is interesting. If you had all the money you needed to have to support yourself and your family, zero financial worries, what job profession would you be doing? Or rather, what would you spend your time on?

**[发言人]**: 这太超现实了，这是你给我的问题，在我来之前就被问了。这就像一个上帝的时刻，这注定如此。

**[发言人]**: That's surreal that this is the question you're giving me that that was asked before I got here. Like that's that's a God moment, too. Like that's meant to be.

**[发言人]**: 所以，因为那就是我。我拥有我需要的所有钱。我现在拥有我的健康。我拥有我的时间。今年，我打算做什么？我今年的梦想是什么？我想拥有一个**无尽的滑雪季**。所以，到年底，问我，我今年每个月都在某个地方滑雪了吗？我今天离开你。我回**佛罗伦萨****24小时**，然后我转身，和朋友们一起去**瑞士**的**韦尔比耶**。我今年每个月都打算和朋友和家人在世界各地滑雪，为了乐趣。我把这作为我最后的梦想，帮助下一代聪明理财。这是我的最后一本书。这可能是我最后的播客。你所做的就是更新了你**20年前**写的那本轰动一时的畅销书，那本书卖出了数百万册，使其与我们现在所处的财务状况和世界相关。

**[发言人]**: So, cuz that's me. I have enough. I have all the money that I need. I have my health right now. I have my time. And this year, what am I going to what what I want to go do my dream for the year? I want to have an endless ski season. So, at the end of the year, ask me, did I ski somewhere every month this year? I leave you today. I go back to **Florence** for 24 hours and I turn around, go to **Verbier**, **Switzerland** with friends. I'm going to try to ski somewhere every day, every month this year with friends and with family all around the world for fun. I did this as my last dream to help one more generation be smart with their money. This is my final book. This may be my final podcast. And what you've done is you've updated your smash hit best-selling book that's that sold millions and millions and millions of copies that you wrote 20 years ago to make it relevant to the current financial situation and world that we live in.

**[发言人]**: 我的目标是，我的许多读者现在都五十多岁和六十多岁了，但他们像我一样有年幼的孩子，我希望这本书能让他们拿在手里。

**[发言人]**: 我认为人们没有完全意识到你曾与地球上许多最具影响力的人合作过，并将继续合作，这有多么重要。你从这些人身上注意到了什么模式？
