### 特朗普的格陵兰战略与减肥药的新承诺

特朗普政府正在推动对格陵兰的控制，这是一个 semi-autonomous territory of Denmark。特朗普认为，格陵兰对美国的国家安全至关重要。

> 如果你看看格陵兰，你会看到俄罗斯和中国的船只在那里四处活动。我们需要它来确保国家安全。我们必须拥有它。

特朗普已经任命了一名特别特使前往格陵兰，负责推动这一目标。这一举动引起了格陵兰和丹麦官员的愤怒。

>> If you take a look at Greenland, you look up and down the coast, you have Russian and Chinese ships all over the place. We need it for national security. We have to have it. President Trump is renewing his calls for the US to take over Greenland, which is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark.

>> Greenland's a big deal.

>> Yeah.

>> This week, he appointed a special envoy to the island, something he's only done for a short list of foreign policy priorities like Ukraine and the Middle East. He's picked the governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, for the position. After the announcement, Landry thanked Trump on social media, writing, "It's an honor to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the US." Officials in both Greenland and Denmark are furious. Their prime ministers put out a joint statement saying, "You cannot annex other countries, not even by invoking international security. Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders." A poll earlier this year showed that at least 85% of residents there opposed the idea of being absorbed into the US. After the envoy was announced, Denmark's foreign minister said he would summon the American ambassador in Copenhagen for an explanation. He already summoned other American diplomats earlier this year over reports that the US was spying on the island. Most of Greenland is within the Arctic Circle where world powers are competing for control of shipping corridors and untapped natural resources. Though yesterday, Trump denied oil and minerals were driving his decision.

与此同时，FDA已经批准了一种新的减肥药的pill版本，这可能会让更多人选择使用。目前，几乎所有的GLP-1药物都是注射剂，这可能会让一些患者感到不适。

GLP1 weight loss drugs have been blockbuster hits in recent years with Ozmpic and Waggoi becoming household names. And now the Food and Drug Administration has approved a pill version of WGOI, which could lead more people to consider taking it. Currently, almost all GLP-1 drugs are injectable, which can be a hurdle for patients who are uncomfortable with or afraid of needles. But a clinical trial sponsored by Novon Nordisk, the company that makes WGO, found the pill version was roughly as effective as the shot. The drug maker says it will be available in the US early next year. It remains to be seen if realworld results will match those from the trial, but more pill options seem to be coming. Eli Liy, the company that makes competitor weight loss drugs like Zepbound and MARO, is expected to release its own pill in the spring.
