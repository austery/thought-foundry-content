<p class="english-text">And again, I'm always looking for a particular hook to the moment. Is there is there a particular hook to the moment for this shirt?</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 嗯，这是十二月的第一周，是假日季节。你肯定能想到，我既会有一件圣诞风格的毛衣，而且它也会是《星球大战》主题的，你懂我的。所以我选择了它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it's the first week in December. It's the holiday season. You had to imagine that I would both own a a Christmas style sweater and that it would also be Star Wars themed, knowing me as you do. So, that's what I went with.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 好的，我明白了。我明白了。嗯，我今天要谈论一个人，我想我们以前从未在节目中谈论过他。他的名字叫霍华德·弗格森（Howard Ferguson）。我要站起来，让大家看看他长什么样。他就是霍华德·弗格森。霍华德·弗格森很久以前是安大略省的省长。他实际上在本周的96年前赢得了他的第二次连任。他是我们的第九任省长。他从1923年到1930年共任职。在此期间赢得了三次选举。嗯，我该怎么说呢？他在第二个任期内提前举行了选举，然后赢得了第三次。这听起来熟悉吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, I got it. I got it. Well, I'm going to talk about a guy that I I don't think we've ever talked about on this program before. Uh his name is Howard Ferguson. And I'm going to do my little stand up so everybody can see what he looks like. There he is. That's Howard Ferguson. Howard Ferguson was the premier of Ontario a long time ago. He actually won his second consecutive election 96 years ago this week. He was our ninth premier. He served in total from 1923 to 1930. Won three elections during that time. Um, how do I put this? He called an early election during his second mandate and then won a third. Does that sound familiar at all?</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 它开始敲响警钟了。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It's it started to ring some bells. Yeah.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 我很确定一个叫福特（Doug Ford）的人今年早些时候也成功做到了这一点。弗格森因许多事情而闻名。第一，他击败了……还记得上周我们谈论的欧内斯特·德鲁里（Ernest Drury）吗？他是安大略省联合农民党唯一一位省长。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Pretty sure a guy named Ford just managed to pull that off earlier this year as well. Uh Ferguson was a bit well known for well for a bunch of things. Number one, he he defeated the Remember last week we talked about uh Ernest Drury who was the one and only United Farmers of Ontario premier. Yes.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 他在1923年，仅一个任期后就击败了德鲁里。所以弗格森因此而闻名。他也很出名，我们现在要谈谈酒。他因举行了一次关于是否应该放宽安大略省售酒条件的**公民投票**（plebiscite: 一种直接投票，通常用于决定某项公共政策，结果可能不具约束力）而闻名。他显然想要更多的税收来支持他的项目，他认为如果我们卖更多的酒，我们就能获得更多的收入，就能提供更多的项目。公民投票通过了，之后啤酒就被称为“弗吉的泡沫”。[笑声]“弗吉的泡沫”。那是当时人们对啤酒的称呼。然后他还创建了一个新的省级机构，负责监管和监督安大略省的酒精购买和销售。你能想象那叫什么吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He defeated Drury in 1923 after just one term. So Ferguson is famous for that. He's also well known, we're going to talk booze here for a second. He's well known for having a plebite on whether conditions for selling booze in the province of Ontario should be loosened up. He obviously wanted more tax revenue to support his programs and he thought if we sell more booze we'll get more revenue. We can offer more programs. The plebite passed and after that beer became known as Fergy's foam. [laughter] Fergie's foam. That's what they called beer back in the day. And he also then went on to create a new provincial institution that would sort of regulate and oversee the purchase and sale of alcohol in the province of Ontario. Can you imagine what that was called?</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 嗯，它当时叫 **LCBO** 吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh was it called the LCBO at its</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 对，就是它。**安大略省酒类管制局**（LCBO: Liquor Control Board of Ontario: 负责监管和销售安大略省酒精饮料的省级机构）。我们应该感谢霍华德·弗格森。他在1930年结束省长生涯后，实际上还在继续工作。他被任命为驻英国高级专员。所以他的公共生活并没有就此结束。我看到马修·奥梅拉（Matthew Omera）给我发了一条信息说：“什么是公民投票？解释一下什么是公民投票。”[笑声]真的吗，马修？你觉得人们不知道什么是公民投票吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">correct? There you go. Liquor Control Board of Ontario. The LCBO. We have Howard Ferguson to thank for that. After his career as premier was over in 1930, he actually kept going. He was the he got appointed to be the high commissioner to Great Britain. So his public life did not end after that. And I see Matthew Omera sending me a note here saying, "What's a plebicide? Explain what a plebite [laughter] is." Really, Matthew? You don't think people know what a plebbeite is?</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 一次不具约束力的全民公投。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">A a non-binding referendum.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 嗯，它就是一次全民公投。是的，没错。它在全省范围内进行了一次投票。好的。好的，马修。现在我们都很高兴了。如果你想拜访霍华德·弗格森，你可以去，因为像许多其他安大略省的首长一样，猜猜他葬在哪里？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it's a referendum. Yeah, exactly. Right. It had a provincewide vote about the thing. Okay. Okay, Matthew. Now we're we're all happy here. If you want to go visit Howard Ferguson, you can because like many other Ontario first ministers, guess where he's buried?</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 在快乐山公墓。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Over at Mount Pleasant.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 他就在快乐山公墓，离我们现在这里步行半小时。如果你在皇后公园（Queens Park）附近，那里有一个……是的，这是我有一天拍的他的墓碑照片。如果你去皇后公园，那里有麦克唐纳（McDonald）大楼、赫本（Hepern）大楼、弗罗斯特（Frost）大楼，还有弗格森（Ferguson）大楼。弗格森大楼就是以这个人，G.霍华德·弗格森命名的。说到这里，我还没说完。说到这里，就在本周，有人在任期时间上超过了霍华德·弗格森。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">He is at Mount Pleasant, half an hour walk away from here where we are right now. And if you hang out at Queens Park, there is something called Yeah, there's the picture of his headstone which I snapped one day. And if you go to Queens Park, there is a, you know, they got a McDonald block, a Hepern block, a Frost block, and they have a Ferguson block. And the Ferguson block is named after this guy right here, G. Howard Ferguson. And while we're on the subject, I'm not done yet. While we're on the subject, somebody passed Howard Ferguson in terms of time spent in office this very week. Yeah.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 那位省长就是道格·福特（Doug Ford）。道格·福特现在担任省长已经七年五个月零四天了，我想，这意味着他已经超过了霍华德·弗格森，成为史上第八位任期最长的省长。我们总共有26位省长。福特是第26位。他已经成为史上第八位任期最长的省长，就在本周刚刚超过了霍华德·弗格森。你还想知道其他无用的琐事吗，还是我们继续？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And that premier's name is Doug Ford. Doug Ford has now been premier for seven years, 5 months, and four days, I think, which means he has passed Howard Ferguson for the eighth longest serving premier of all time. We've had 26 premieres. Ford is number 26. He's already the eighth longest serving premier of all time, having just passed Howard Ferguson this week. Any other useless trivia you want to know or should we move on?</p>

### 审计长报告：医疗系统支出问题

John Michael McGrath: 嗯，这是反对党和媒体在皇后公园日历上最喜欢的一天，即**审计长**（Auditor General: 负责审查政府支出和运营的独立官员）关于政府如何使用你寄给安大略省公司（Ontario, Inc.）的资金的年度报告。审计长是一位无党派的任命官员，她不向政府报告，而是向整个立法机构报告，她的任务是派遣调查员进入各个部门，揭开幕后，确保预算得到妥善使用。JMM，今年审计长和政府批评者似乎被什么所吸引了？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, it's one of the opposition and media's favorite days on the Queens Park calendar, the annual report of the Auditor General on how well the government is spending the dollars you send to Ontario, Inc. The auditor is a nonpartisan appointee who reports not to the government but rather to the entire legislature and her mission is to send investigators into various ministries, pull back the curtain and ensure budgets are being well spent. JMM, what seems to have captivated the auditor and the critics of the government this year?</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 今年的报告……抱歉，审计长的报告总是有很多不同的部分，其中一些只是她审计省政府账目的法定职责。但是，总有一些记者喜欢深入挖掘的“更吸引人的”话题。所以今年他们称之为“绩效审计”。往年它们被称为“物有所值审计”。但这是审计长审查政府内部特定部门或机构，并查看资金使用情况的地方。是否存在冗余操作？是否存在浪费操作？是否存在不符合其他省份最佳实践的操作？所以今年，审计长非常集中地关注医疗保健，只有一个例外，我稍后会谈到，但有多个章节涉及各种可以广义地称为医疗保健问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The report this year uh has sorry there's always a bunch of different chunks to the auditor's report and some of this is just like her statutory obligations to audit the province's books. Um but uh then there are always the um the juicier topics that the reporters like to to dive into. And so in this year they're calling them performance audits. They have in previous years they've been called value for money audits. But this is where the auditor looks at specific departments or agencies within the government and looks at how well uh the money is being spent. Are there uh redundant operations? Are there wasteful operations? Are there operations uh that are uh not meeting best practices in other provinces? And so this year uh the auditor really narrowly focused on health care with one exception which I I'll get into but there are multiple chapters about different types of uh what you could broadly call sort of health care issues.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 所以，审计长审查了初级护理的可及性，审查了医生账单，审查了我们如何在该省培养家庭医生，以及为医院和长期护理机构采购**个人防护设备**（PPE: Personal Protective Equipment: 用于保护穿戴者免受健康或安全威胁的设备）。而且，一般来说，如果审计长就某个问题撰写了大量章节，那通常对政府来说不是好消息。所以在这种情况下，当然，在所有这些领域，审计长都发现政府本可以更仔细地管理公共资金。记者们最关注的两个领域是医生账单和采购审计。医生账单当然是该省的一个长期存在的问题。至少从我开始在皇后公园工作十多年以来，一直有报道称，有些医生……你知道，我们在安大略省支付医生费用的方式是医生提供服务，然后他们向 **OHIP**（Ontario Health Insurance Plan: 安大略省的公共医疗保险计划）收取该服务的费用。有报道称，有些医生向省政府收取一天内工作超过24小时的费用。有时甚至收取一年内工作超过365天的费用。这些都应该引起警惕。审计长谨慎地表示，她不能直接说这些事情是欺诈性的。它们可能只是文书错误。但关键是要明白，省政府实际上没有任何自动化系统来标记这些情况以进行进一步调查。省政府基本上依赖公众的举报和投诉来确定是否有需要调查的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, uh, the auditor looked at access to primary care, looked at, uh, physician billing, uh, looked at how we educate family doctors in the province and, uh, procuring, uh, personal protective equipment for, uh, hospitals and long-term care homes. And, uh, you know, generally, if the auditor, uh, has has written a substantial chapter about an issue, it's not usually good news for the government. And so in this case, of course, uh in all of these areas, uh the auditor found cases where the government could be minding public money more carefully. Two areas that I think got the most attention from reporters, uh were uh physician billing and uh the procurement uh audits. Uh physician billing, of course, is a a long-standing issue in the province. Uh there have been uh at least I mean certainly since I started at Queens Park going back more than a decade uh there have been reports of uh doctors who uh you know the the way we pay doctors in Ontario is the doctor performs a service and then they bill OHIP uh for that service and there are reported cases of doctors uh billing the province for having done more than 24 hours of work in a day. Uh sometimes having uh build for doing more than 365 days of work in a year. these are the kinds of things that ought to raise red flags. And the auditor is careful to say that she can't, you know, directly say that these things are fraudulent. They might just be paperwork errors. Uh but the the key thing to understand is that the province doesn't actually have any automated system to uh flag these kinds of cases for further investigation. The province basically relies on uh uh tips and complaints from the public to determine whether there's something to to investigate. So, you know, why does that matter?</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 那么，这为什么重要呢？嗯，我们每年在医生支付上花费200亿美元。其中大部分，但并非全部，通过按服务收费系统进行。所以，即使政府估计有3%到5%的账单可能存在问题，那也是每年数亿美元。这是真金白银。所以，再次强调，问题不在于我们能直接说这都是欺诈，而是省政府实际上没有任何系统来检查，就像我的信用卡公司一样，如果他们认为我的万事达卡有欺诈性或异常购买，他们会非常警觉。我想安大略省政府也应该有一个类似的系统。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, we spent $20 billion a year on uh physician uh payments. Uh most of that, but not on entirely through the fee for service system. So, even if the government's estimate of something like 3 to 5% of uh billing might be potentially uh uh problematic, that's hundreds of millions of dollars a year. It's real money. So um again the issue is not that we can say directly that this is all fraudulent but the province doesn't actually have any system to check like the way you know my credit card company is is pretty on the ball if they think that there's been a a fraudulent or or an unusual uh purchase with my Mastercard. Uh I I I think maybe the the province of Ontario could reasonably be said to need something similar.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 为了理解她的任务范围，她实际上没有权力去追究医生并让他们偿还超额费用。这是对卫生部缺乏尽职调查的批评，对吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And just to understand the scope of her mission here, she does not actually have the authority then to go after doctors and and get them to repay if they've overdrawn. This is criticism of the health ministry's lack of due diligence. Is that right?</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 是的，没错。卫生部可以而且已经采取了这些措施，并且确实会定期发现一些案例，他们会告诉医生：“啊，别想了。把钱还回来。”他们说在几年内已经追回了大约800万美元。也许，让我们乐观一点。也许安大略省正在运行世界上最干净的公共医疗保健系统，没有进一步的欺诈行为可发现。或者，也许我们只有八名员工负责进行这类调查，这可能是瓶颈所在，也许我们应该在调查方面更积极一些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, that's correct. The the Ministry of Health can and and has these measures and and does, you know, periodically find cases where they say to a doctor like, "Ah, nice try. Give us the money back." And and they say they've recovered something like $8 million over a period of several years. Maybe, let's be optimistic. Maybe Ontario is just running the cleanest public health care system in the world and there's there's no further fraud to be found. Uh or maybe the fact that we only have I think she said eight staff uh tasked with uh doing the these kinds of investigations. Uh maybe that's maybe the the the bottleneck and and maybe we should get a bit more aggressive with uh our investigations.</p>
</details>

### 审计长报告：个人防护设备采购

John Michael McGrath: 好的，继续谈医疗保健。我们都记得在疫情期间，那三个字母 **PPE**（Personal Protective Equipment: 用于保护穿戴者免受健康或安全威胁的设备）变得非常有名，即个人防护设备。审计长对它的现状有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, staying with healthcare. We all remember back in the days of CO the three letters PP became extremely famous personal protective equipment. What did the auditor have to say about the status of that? So the government created Supply Ontario uh for the purpose of making sure that we were never uh caught unaware as uh suddenly relying on other countries, other uh uh jurisdictions for the PPE that we needed cuz obviously people remember you know that that mad scramble to find masks and gloves and sanitizers in that first year of the pandemic.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 所以政府创建了**安大略省供应局**（Supply Ontario: 安大略省政府设立的机构，负责集中采购和供应链管理），目的是确保我们永远不会在突然依赖其他国家、其他司法管辖区提供我们所需的个人防护设备时措手不及，因为显然人们记得在疫情第一年，为了寻找口罩、手套和消毒剂而疯狂抢购的场景。该机构花了很长时间才建立并运行起来。实际上，我认为直到2022年，当我们几乎宣布疫情结束之后，它才正式获得对其中一些库存的控制权。但尽管如此，它现在已经存在了。而且，[笑声]你猜怎么着，我们实际上处理过期库存的速度比我们使用它的速度还要快。也就是说，我们正在扔掉东西，或者至少在某些情况下焚烧它，因为它一直未使用地堆放在仓库里，其速度比分发给医院或长期护理机构的速度还要快。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And it it took a while to get the uh uh agency up and running. It was actually I think only formally uh given control of uh some of these stock piles after we had sort of all but declared the pandemic over in 2022. But nevertheless, it exists now. And um [laughter] wouldn't you know it uh we are actually uh getting rid of expired inventory faster than we are using it. I I.e. we are throwing stuff out or in at least some cases incinerating it uh because it has it has gone unused sitting in warehouses uh faster than it is being distributed to hospitals or long-term care homes.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 我可以问一个我认为合理的问题吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Can I ask what I think is a reasonable question?</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 这到底是怎么发生的？[笑声]

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">How does that happen exactly? [laughter]</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: [喘息]所以，在其他省份，像**安大略省供应局**（Supply Ontario: 安大略省政府设立的机构，负责集中采购和供应链管理）这样的机构将是医院、长期护理机构和医疗保健部门（无论你如何定义）个人防护设备的唯一采购方，对吗？这样做是有原因的，对吗？一个单一的机构可以获得批量折扣，诸如此类。我们安大略省没有这样做。医院采购自己的个人防护设备，然后安大略省供应局也签订这些长期合同，以确保这些设备在安大略省制造，对吗？因此，为了给投资者和制造商信心，让他们相信他们将继续拥有一个客户，他们将投资在安大略省建造这些东西，所以你签订了这些长期合同。但正如审计长所解释的，考虑到我们实际使用这些东西的速度有多慢，而且医院都在以目前的速度订购自己的供应品，我们正处于这种永久的失衡状态，我们总是会有更多的东西过期，而不是实际使用。这只是，嗯，它目前不是一个合理的设置。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">[gasps] So, in other provinces, uh, an agency like Supply Ontario would be the sole purchaser of, uh, PPE for hospitals and long-term care homes and and the healthcare sector, however you want to define that, right? And there are reasons why you would want to do that, right? A, a single agency could get bulk discounts, that kind of thing. We don't do that in Ontario. the hospitals procure their own PPE and then supply Ontario also engages in these long-term contracts to uh you know remember its mission is also to ensure that this equipment is made in Ontario, right? And so in order to give investors and manufacturers the the confidence that they are going to uh continue to have a customer that they're going to invest in building these things here in Ontario, you sign these long-term contracts. But as the auditor explained, given how slowly we are actually using this stuff and the hospitals have are all uh ordering their own uh uh supplies of this stuff uh at at the current rates we are in this sort of permanent uh disequilibrium where we are always going to be having more stuff expire than we are actually using. It's just it is not a um it's not currently a rational setup.</p>

John Michael McGrath: [笑声]

<p class="english-text">[laughter]</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 好的，我不应该对此发笑，因为它就是这样。嗯，我们再谈谈审计长可能关注的另一件事。本届政府花了很多时间试图告诉人们，他们在将患者与初级护理医生联系起来方面做了很多工作。审计长对此有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, let's I shouldn't be laughing about it because it is anyway it is what it is. Uh let's do one more thing that the auditor general might have looked to. This government has spent a lot of time trying to tell people that they are doing a lot as it relates to connecting patients with primary care doctors. What do the auditor have to say about that?</p>
</details>

### 审计长报告：初级医疗服务

John Michael McGrath: 没错。审计长对政府公布的一些数字有点怀疑，如果我可以这样说的话。他们认为政府低估了有多少人没有初级护理医生。政府使用的数字我相信是130万。审计长根据外部研究表明，这个数字可能更接近200万。因此，如果需要初级护理的人更多，那么这也意味着我们需要培养更多的初级护理医生。这就是你进入例如我们是否正在培养足够的初级护理医生的问题。审计报告中还有一整个关于这方面的章节，其中有一些有趣的细节，说明为什么这没有像它应该的那样运作良好。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. Uh the auditor is a bit more uh skeptical of some of the numbers that the government has put out if I could put it that way. uh they they think that the government is understating a uh how many people are going without uh a a primary care physician. Uh the government has used the number I believe of 1.3 million. The auditor general uh based on uh external research suggests that number could be more like 2 million. Uh and then consequently if there are more people in need of primary care then that also means we need to train more primary care doctors. And uh this is where you get into questions of for example uh are we uh educating uh have we created that pipeline to educate enough uh primary care physicians and there was a whole other uh section in the audit about that and there's some interesting sort of granular details about why that's not working as well as it should.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 但我认为这里有一个很有说服力的细节，麦金蒂（McGinty）政府在2009年创建了一个名为“**医疗保健连接**”（Healthcare Connect: 一项旨在将患者与接受新病人的初级护理医生匹配的服务）的服务，试图将人们与愿意接受新病人的初级护理医生匹配起来。相对而言的好消息是，相当一部分人正在以一个不算疯狂的时间线与医生建立联系。[笑声]但是，该行业普遍认为，“医疗保健连接”工具很糟糕，不起作用，肯定不如其他司法管辖区的类似工具好用。根据审计长引用的一个文件，它“不再适合其目的”，医疗保健行业的参与者不希望政府修复这个工具。他们说它已经彻底损坏和过时，他们只希望政府从头开始。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh but I I think one uh telling detail here uh the uh the McGinty government in 2009 uh created something called uh healthcare connect a service to try and match uh uh people to primary care physicians who are open to taking on uh new patients. And the relative good news is that um a substantial fraction of people are are getting connected with uh doctors uh within let's call it a a a not insane timeline. [laughter] Um but the the general sense in the sector is that the the healthcare connected tool uh is bad is not working uh is certainly not working as well as similar tools in other jurisdictions. And uh according to uh one document quoted by the auditor uh it is no longer fit for purpose and uh the the the participants in the healthcare sector do not want the government to fix this tool. They say it is so thoroughly broken and obsolete that they just want the government to start over from a clean sheet of paper.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: “不再适合其目的”。是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Not fit for purpose. Yes,</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 这是一个很好的说法。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that's a nice way of saying</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 嗯，就是完全坏了，无法修复。我想最后一点是，我们应该说，审计长的任务本质上是进入这些部门进行调查，目的不一定是为了点名批评那些犯错的人，而是因为，你知道，有些部门非常庞大。很多在这些部门工作的人并不知道自己部门里发生了什么。审计长会进去调查，让这些部门知道发生了什么，然后理论上应该发生的是，现在我们发现了这个问题，我们就可以解决它。这才是应该发生的事情。而且我认为这在大多数时候确实发生了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh just totally broken and beyond repair it down. I guess one last thing on this. We should say, you know, it is the auditor's mission essentially to go into these ministries, do their investigation, not for the purposes of necessarily naming and shaming people who've screwed up along the way, but because, you know, some of these departments are so massive. It is the case that a lot of people who work in these ministries don't know what's going on in their own ministries. The auditor goes in, investigates, lets the ministries know what's going on, and then theoretically what's supposed to happen is now that we found out about this, we can fix this. That's what's supposed to happen. And I think that actually does happen most of the time.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 是的。我的意思是，我认为除了少数例外，我稍后会谈到。政府接受了审计长关于所有这些医疗保健部门改革的所有建议。我提到了所有医疗保健新闻的例外。审计长还专门写了一章关于回收利用的内容。而且，作为她法定工作的一部分，她被要求就《**环境权利法案**》（Environmental Bill of Rights: 安大略省的一项法律，赋予公民参与环境决策和寻求环境正义的权利）的运作情况提交报告。嗯，正如你可能想象的那样，本届政府在环境问题上有着“斑驳”的历史，审计长对他们如何使用或规避《环境权利法案》提出了一些批评。这是政府不接受审计长建议的少数领域之一，因为她基本上要求他们停止规避《环境权利法案》，而他们说不，我们保留继续这样做的权利。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean, I think with a handful of exception and well, I'll get to that in a moment. The government uh accepted all of the auditor's recommendations for uh changes in all of these healthcare sections. I've mentioned the the exception to all the healthcare news. The auditor did also have a chapter about uh recycling. Um and also uh again as part of her statutory work she is required to uh uh do a report on the functioning of the environmental bill of rights. Um there there were some as you might imagine this government has a um checkered uh history with environmental issues and uh the auditor had some criticism about how they have used or have gotten around the environmental bill of rights. Uh this was one of the few areas where the government did not accept the auditor's recommendations because she basically asked them to stop going around the e the the environmental bill of rights and they said no we we reserve the right to continue doing that</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 而且在法律上他们可以这样做，你知道，如果他们准备在下次选举中付出任何政治代价的话。有时有，有时没有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and and and legally they can do that and you know if they're prepared to pay whatever political price there is to pay at the next election. Sometimes there is sometimes there isn't.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 是的。我们将看看是否会付出一些代价。到目前为止还没有。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. And and we will see if uh some price is yet to be paid. It hasn't so far.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 这就是所有问题的答案。我们拭目以待。有了这个，我们进入第二个议题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That is the answer to everything. We shall see. And with that, we're off to issue two.</p>
</details>

### 新司法和犯罪法案

John Michael McGrath: 政府上周推出了《**将罪犯关在监狱法案**》（Keeping Criminals Behind Bars Act: 安大略省政府推出的一项旨在改革保释制度和加强公共安全的法案），其中包括几项立法修改，旨在改革保释制度，保护猫狗免受动物试验等。好的，让我们深入了解一下。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The government introduced the Keeping Criminals Behind Bars Act last week and includes several legislative changes designed to do everything from reforming the bail system to protecting cats and dogs from animal testing. Okay, let's get into the nitty-gritty on this. Absolutely.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 当然。所以我想政府在这里推出的头条项目是，它将要求被指控犯罪的人提供现金担保金才能获得保释。目前，一个人可以凭承诺付款获得释放。所以现在他们实际上必须拿出现金。而且他们还想对GPS监控设备收取使用费。这里有一些关于合宪性的有趣问题。我的意思是，人们知道已经有人在猜测这可能违反《宪章》时不会感到惊讶，对吗？我们之前在播客中说过，我只想提醒大家，那些获得保释的人尚未被判有罪。因此，他们在宪法上是无辜的。所以，关于你如何对待这样的人存在疑问。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I think that the headline item that the government introduced here uh it would require uh people accused of crimes to uh present cash security deposits for bail. Uh currently a person uh could be released on a promise to pay. So now they would actually have to put cash on the table. Um and they also want to introduce a a user fee for uh GPS monitoring devices. Um there are some interesting questions about the constitutionality here. I mean, it won't surprise people to learn that that there are already people uh speculating about a potential charter breach uh with this, right? We have said this before on on the podcast, and I will just remind people like uh people who are uh out on bail are uh not yet convicted of any crime. They are thus constitutionally innocent. Um and so there are questions about how you can uh treat people like that.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 还有一个有趣的问题是，一般来说，与保释相关的事项是联邦刑事事项。所以，这里有一个问题，法院是否会说安大略省只是侵犯了联邦管辖权，或者正如我看到的一位律师所说，这项法案可能会“两次违宪”。所以，你知道，我们将把它留给法院，但我认为这是一个非常有趣的问题。你知道，就政府的辩护而言，法院管理事项也属于省级管辖权。所以，这是我很容易看到法院在决定其合宪性方面可能做出任何一种判决的领域之一。该立法还提议公开安大略省性犯罪者和人口贩运者登记册中的某些信息。这是各种团体一直倡导的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There's also an interesting issue about like generally speaking, the the the matters around bail are a federal criminal matter. And so, uh, there's a question here of whether a court will say that Ontario was simply intruding on a matter of federal jurisdiction or or as one lawyer I saw put it, uh, this bill might manage to be unconstitutional twice. Um, so, you know, we will leave that to the the courts, but I think it's it's a very um interesting one. You know, to the government's uh defense here or in the government's defense here, you know, matters of the administration of courts are also provincial jurisdiction. So, this is one of those areas where I could easily see a court going either way in in terms of um deciding the the constitutionality of this.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 我承认这不是我非常了解的争议，但我确实知道人们一直在争取公开这些信息，而且自由党和至少在现在之前的几年里，省保守党政府都抵制了这些努力。倡导者表示，这些信息将使犯罪者承担责任。当然，现在我们谈到猫狗。该立法将修订《**动物研究法案**》（Animals for Research Act: 规范动物用于科学研究的法律），禁止对狗和猫进行侵入性医学研究。它还禁止在安大略省的设施中为研究目的繁殖狗和猫。尽管一些批评者表示，这些动物可以从收容所或其他潜在的庇护所获得。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh the legislation is also proposing to make certain information from the Ontario Sex Offender and Trafficker Registry publicly available. This is something that uh various groups have advocated for. Uh I I I will confess that this is not something that a controversy I'm super read in on, but I do know that people have been fighting to uh get this information made public and both liberal and at least for several years before now the provincial uh conservative government uh resisted some of those efforts. Uh advocates saying that, you know, this information will will hold offenders accountable. Uh and of course now we get to the the cats and dogs. The legislation would amend the Animals for Research Act to prohibit uh invasive medical research on uh dogs and cats. It also bans the breeding of dogs and cats for research purposes at Ontario facilities. Uh although some critics have said uh those same animals could be sourced from pounds or other uh potential shelters.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 这东西是从哪儿来的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Where did this thing come from?</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 这就是那种我认为与省长个人性格有关的事情。每隔一段时间，他就会表现出他是一个动物爱好者，他提出了一些这样的措施。当存在一个非常强大的反游说团体时，动物爱好者一方并不总是能获胜，如果我可以这样说的话。几年前，政府修订了一些农业立法，使得动物权利活动家更难记录虐待行为。但那是因为安大略省有一个非常重要的农业游说团体。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is one of those things where I think this is like the premier's personality. like every once in a while this comes out that he's like an animal lover and he he has proposed some of these measures. Um when there is a really um strong counter lobby you the the the animal lover side doesn't always uh win the day if I could put it that way right like a few years back they uh the government amended uh some farm legislation to make it uh harder to for animal rights activists to to document abuses. Um but that's because there's a very uh uh important agricultural lobby in Ontario. Right.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 所以回到八月，与多伦多大学相关的**调查新闻局**（Investigative Journalism Bureau: 与多伦多大学相关的调查新闻机构）发表了一篇报道，详细介绍了在安大略省伦敦市对小猎犬进行的实验。小猎犬是一种可爱的狗，我想。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So back in August, the Investigative Journalism Bureau, which is associated with the University of Toronto, published a story that detailed experiments done on beagles uh in London, Ontario. Uh beagle's a cute dog, I guess.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 是的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 是的。我被允许发表评论。我说小猎犬很可爱，对吧？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. I'm allowed to editorial. I said beagles are cute, right?</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 小猎犬是可爱的狗。[笑声]没错。省长看到了这个故事，在新闻发布会上谈论了它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Beagle is a cute dog. [laughter] That is correct. Um the the premier saw this story, spoke about it at a press conference um and and you</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 他有点哽咽了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">got a little choked up actually.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 是的。是的。就像这似乎真的激励了他。而且，你知道，从更粗俗的政治角度来看，我们可以说这在政治上是一个轻松的胜利。我认为没有很多人会站出来为对小猎犬进行动物试验辩护。事实上，涉事实验室确实试图发表辩护，称这是重要的医学研究。我确信他们不是出于残忍而这样做，但他们似乎在与政府的争论中失败了。我只能这样说。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Yeah. Like like it seemed to really sort of animate him. Um and you know on the sort of more crass political side of of things, we can say like this this is an easy win politically. I don't think there's a lot of people coming out of the woodwork to defend animal testing on beagles. And in in fact the the lab in question did try to issue a defense saying that this is important medical research. And I'm sure that they're not doing it for cruelty's sake, but they seem to have lost the argument with the government. Let me put it that way.</p>
</details>

### 安德鲁法案：危险驾驶与问责

Steve Paikin: 我们现在要稍微改变一下话题，因为我们要谈论一些相当悲惨的事情。现在我们要谈论一个叫做“**安德鲁法案**”（Andrew's Law: 以安德鲁·科斯特洛命名，旨在惩罚危险驾驶并支持受害者家庭的法案）的东西，这是指安德鲁·科斯特洛（Andrew Costello），他是一位三个孩子的父亲，被一名被指控危险驾驶和特技驾驶的司机撞死。顺便说一句，这名司机就是当时撞上省长道格·福特所乘坐的安大略省警车的那个人。所以，如果可以的话，让我们了解一下这方面的细节。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're going to make a bit of a hard turn here because we're going to talk about something quite tragic. Now, we're going to talk about something called Andrew's Law, which is a reference to Andrew Costello, who is the father of three who was killed by a driver charged with dangerous and stunt driving. This is the same driver, incidentally, who hit an OP vehicle that Premier Doug Ford was traveling in at the time. So, let's get the details on this if we can.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 所以，根据提议的“安德鲁法案”，任何被判危险驾驶致死的人都将被终身禁止驾驶。此外，如果警方怀疑司机危险驾驶，可以立即吊销其驾照90天。政府还提议增加对无证驾驶者的罚款，并将商业车辆分心驾驶的罚款加倍。因此，这不仅仅针对普通公众，专门驾驶商业车辆的人可能会面临更高的罚款。而且，我认为这可能是最受关注的一项，他们还将就对导致父母或监护人死亡的酒驾司机实施新的惩罚类别征求公众意见。酒驾司机将负责在经济上支持受害者的孩子。嗯。我将重复你刚才说的话，那就是，这些指控都尚未在法庭上进行审理。一个人在被证明有罪之前是无辜的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, under Andrew's law, as proposed, anybody who is convicted of dangerous driving causing death will receive a lifetime ban from getting behind the wheel. Uh, police can also immediately suspend a driver's license for 90 days if they suspect the driver is driving dangerously. Uh, they are the government is also proposing to increase fines for those driving with suspended licenses and doubling fines for distracted driving if you're in a commercial vehicle. So it's not just members of the general public, people who are specifically operating commercial vehicles uh could uh see increased penalties. Uh and they also, and this I I think is maybe the the item that got the most attention, they are also going to consult the public on making um I guess a new class of penalty uh for impaired drivers who cause the death of a parent or a guardian. The impaired driver would then be responsible for financially supporting uh the victim's children. Hm. You I'm going to repeat what you just said a moment ago, which is to say that uh you know the none of these charges has been tested in court yet. Somebody is innocent until proven guilty.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 但如果你出去撞了安大略省长的车，然后又被指控如此不负责任地驾驶，导致这位父亲死亡，那你一定是某种傻瓜。这就是指控。法院将对未来发生的一切做出裁决。但有时你真的会挠头说：“这到底是怎么回事？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But you got to be some kind of stupid if you go out and you you know sideswipe the premier of Ontario's car and then follow that up again allegedly by driving so irresponsibly that the result is the death of this father. That's the charge. The courts will render their verdict on whatever happens in the days ahead. But some days you really do have to scratch your head and say, "What the actual bleepy bleep is going on here?"</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 是的。我的意思是，我将提出两点。一点是普遍的，一点是更具体的。首先，总的来说，我认为我们在法律上对汽车犯罪不够重视。你知道，作为一个骑自行车的人，当我们谈论弱势道路使用者的死亡时，我认为即使有了这项法律，仍然会有很大的领域，我们仍然没有足够重视它。但撇开我的个人偏好不谈，我想说的更具体的一点是，我认为在疫情期间，很多危险的道路行为，如果我可以称之为反社会道路行为的话，变得更糟了。这不仅仅是我在假设。有可测量的数据表明，超速驾驶增加了，因为你知道，我们在这一集中谈论了很多疫情，但有一段时间道路非常空旷，很多人以此为借口，像疯子一样驾驶，我认为很多这种行为还没有被纠正过来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I mean, I will make two points. One, sort of general, a bit more specific. A, in general, I I think we do not take automotive crime super seriously in the law. um you know uh speaking as a cyclist who when we talk about uh the debts of vulnerable road users um I think even with this law there are going to be large areas you know where we still do not take it seriously enough but um quite aside from my hobby horses uh the the more specific thing I would say is that I think uh a lot of um uh risky road behavior uh if I could put it antisocial road behavior uh got a lot worse during CO uh and like this isn't just me hypothesizing. There's like measurable data about uh you know speeding increased because you know we're talking about CO a lot in this this episode but like you know the roads were so empty for a while there a lot of people took that as license to just act like maniacs and I think a lot of that stuff has not been dialed back yet.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 嗯，所以，我当然希望这将是更认真对待人们道路行为的一部分。但是，这再次不是为了发表评论，我认为这本身是不够的。我认为我们需要更严肃的对待，不仅仅是政府通过的法律，而是要一直到街头警察实际制止和惩罚什么样的行为。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, and so, uh, I I certainly hope that this will be part of, uh, taking, uh, people's conduct on the road more seriously. Uh, but this is not, again, to editorialize, I don't think this will be, uh, enough on its own. I think we we need um more serious not seriousness not just from uh the laws that the government passes but going all the way down to you know what uh what kinds of behaviors police officers on the street are going to actually stop and punish.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 明白了。有了这个，我们进入第三个议题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Understood. And with that we're on to issue three.</p>
</details>

### 教育质量与问责办公室 (EQAO) 成绩

John Michael McGrath: **教育质量与问责办公室**（EQAO: Education Quality and Accountability Office: 负责评估安大略省学生学业表现的独立机构），通常在9月或10月发布其成绩。但教育部长保罗·坎德拉（Paul Calandra）一直保留着这些信息，以便“深入研究”这些数字。现在这些数字已经公布，坎德拉表示他将任命一个咨询机构来审查这项考试，因为他说所取得的进展还不够好。JMM，如果你愿意的话，让我们自己深入研究一下这些数字。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The Education Quality and Accountability Office or EQAO as it's commonly known usually releases its scores in September or October. But Education Minister Paul Kandra had been holding on to the information to take a quote deep dive into the numbers. Now the numbers are out and Kandra says he will be appointing an advisory body to examine the test because he says the progress made isn't good enough. JMM, let's take our own deep dive into the numbers if you would.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 好的。所以很快地，EQAO对三年级、六年级和九年级的学生进行测试。在安大略省，三年级学生中，74%的学生达到了阅读的省级标准，65%达到了写作的省级标准，64%达到了数学的省级标准。六年级学生中，阅读达到标准的占86%，写作占85%，但数学只有51%，尽管这比前一年略有增加。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. So very quickly, uh, the EQAO tests kids in grade 3, six, and nine. So for grade three students in Ontario, 74% of students met the provincial standard for reading, 65% for writing, and 64% for math. Uh grade six students, it was 86% for reading, 85% for writing, but only 51% for math, although that was a small increase from the previous year.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 九年级学生，这不能直接比较，因为高中不能直接与小学比较。但58%的学生达到了数学的省级标准。这比前一年提高了4%，85%参加**安大略省中学读写能力测试**（Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test: 安大略省高中生必须通过的读写能力测试）的学生取得了成功。所以，总的来说，一些不错的数字，阅读和写作有一些好的结果，但学生在某些情况下在数学成绩上确实很挣扎。我们看到的改进很小。这就是本周政府传达的信息，即我们看到的进展速度不够快，不符合他们的期望。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh grade nine students, this is not uh directly comparable because high schools are not directly comparable to the elementaryaries. Uh but 58% met the provincial standard for math. that was a 4% improvement uh for the previous year and 85% of students who wrote the Ontario Secondary School literacy test were successful. So, generally speaking, some decent numbers, some some good uh results for reading and writing, but students really uh struggling in some cases with math scores. Uh the improvements that we did see were small. And this is the the line coming out of the government this week that uh the uh progress that uh we are seeing is not fast enough for their liking.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 因此，本周教育部长保罗·坎德拉（Paul Calandra）宣布，他将任命两人审查EQAO考试，并向政府提供关于如何改进该系统的建议。我们不知道这些人是谁。他将在新年正式任命他们。他们将获得报酬，这些不是志愿职位，因为从来都不是。他们将获得每天约1500美元的报酬。所以，我们将看看我们是否能物有所值。[笑声]同时，当然，一些团体一直批评EQAO的整个过程。例如，**安大略省小学教师联合会**（Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario: 代表安大略省小学教师的工会）表示，这些考试并不能真正增加课堂的效用，也不能独自改善学生的学习成果，政府应该废除它，并将这些资金重新分配给课堂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um and so uh this week uh education minister Paul Kandra announced that he will be uh naming two uh people to examine EQAO testing and provide recommendations to the government about how the system uh might be uh improved. Uh we don't know who those people are. He's got going to formally name them in the new year. uh they they will be paid uh these are not going to be volunteer positions as they never are. Uh they are going to be paid something like $1,500 a day for their work. Uh so uh we will see if we get our money's worth for that. [laughter] Um and you know meanwhile of course you know some groups have always criticized the the whole uh process of the EQAO. Um, you know, the Elementary Teachers Federation of Ontario, for example, uh, says that it these tests don't really add any utility to uh, the classroom don't really improve student outcomes on their own and the government should just scrap it and redirect those funds to classrooms.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 我不知道那是真是假。我只是不知道。但我知道这些考试最初是如何产生的，你必须追溯到大约30年前的迈克·哈里斯（Mike Harris）政府，他们审视了该省的教育系统。我想哈里斯省长提出了一个合理的问题，那就是我们如何知道我们的学生是否真的受到了良好的教育？我们如何知道他们是否在进步？我们可以查看哪些独立指标并说：“哦，我们现在比十年前更好了。”而答案显然是，至少我听到的说法是，答案是：“嗯，我们没有任何东西。”因此，我认为在一位名叫戴夫·库克（Dave Cook）的前新民主党教育部长的建议下，他被任命领导一个小组，哈里斯政府引入了EQAO，并决定每年进行这些考试，这当然引发了一系列其他批评，比如老师现在为了考试而教学，这并不能很好地反映孩子们的表现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know if that's true or false. I just I just don't know. But I know how we got these tests in the first place, which is you got to go back about 30 years to the Mike Harris government, which looked at the education system in in the province. And I think Premier Harris asked a reasonable question, which is how do we know whether or not our students are actually getting well educated? How do we know if they're improving? What independent metrics can we look at and say, "Oh, we are better now than we were 10 years ago." And the answer apparently that at least the story I've heard, the answer that came back to him was, "Well, we don't have anything." And as a result uh I think on the recommendation actually of a former New Democrat education minister named Dave Cook whom he appointed to head up a panel uh the Harris government came in with the EQAO and decided to put these tests out every year which of course has begat a whole other series of criticisms like well now teachers teach to the test and they don't re it's really not a good indication of how well kids are doing one way or the other.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 无论如何，这是一场巨大的辩论，已经持续了30年，短期内不会消失，但我们继续前进。在新闻发布会上，一位记者问政府是否可以忽视小组的建议，就像他们对待高等教育蓝丝带小组的建议一样，他们的建议被忽视了。小组有可能回来并呼应教师工会的说法，你知道，更小的班级规模，更多的资金，雇用更多的教师，废除考试。我想这有可能，不是吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Anyway, uh it's a humongous debate, has been for 30 years, not going to go away anytime soon, but we press on. One of the reporters, speaking of pressing, one of the reporters at the press conference asked whether the government could ignore the recommendations from the panel, much as they did with the blue ribbon panel on post-secary education, whose recommendations they ignored. It's possible that the panel could come back and echo what the teacher union said. You know, smaller class sizes, more funding, hire more teachers, scrap the test. That's possible, I suppose, isn't it?</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 是的，世界很大。很多事情都有可能。部长不想排除任何特定的结果。他似乎想留下一个相当开放的可能性，你知道，他想让这些可能性保持开放。他明确排除的唯一一件事是废除EQAO本身的想法。他说他不期望这会发生。嗯，如果部长说了，通常的运作方式是你可以推荐任何你想要的，但如果你推荐这个，那就算了，不会发生的。所以，你知道，通常这些命令都是“管好你自己的事”。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Yeah, it's a big old world. Uh lots of things are possible. Uh the minister did not want to rule out um any specific uh outcomes. He he did seem to want to leave a pretty uh open uh poss you know wanted to leave those possibilities open about the only thing that he did explicitly rule out was the idea of scrapping EQAO itself. He he said he he doesn't expect that to be uh in in the uh uh offing well if the minister said usually the way this works is you can recommend anything you want but if you recommend this forget it ain't going to happen. So you know stick to your lane is usually the way these orders go out.</p>

### 教育部长与手机禁令

Steve Paikin: 在新闻发布会上有一个有点好笑的时刻，你知道，说到“最好找保罗”（Better Call Paul），指的是保罗·坎德拉（Paul Calandra），我们之所以这样称呼他，是因为每当省长遇到“保罗问题”时，他似乎都会说“最好找保罗”，这不像老电视剧《**风骚律师**》（Better Call Saul: 一部美国犯罪剧情电视剧）那样。但是，你知道，关于是否允许学生在课堂上使用手机一直存在很大的争议。而且，你知道，本届政府已经禁止在课堂上使用手机，但这并不意味着[笑声]这并不意味着它不会发生。正如我们将在保罗·坎德拉新闻发布会的这一刻看到的。请播放。

<details>

<p class="english-text">There was a kind of a funny moment at the press conference, you know, speaking of Better Call Paul, as in Paul Kandra, uh, which we have taken to calling him because he seems to be, you know, every time the premier's got a Paul problem, Better Call Paul, unlike Better Call Saul, the old TV show. But, um, you know, there's been a great debate about the advisability of allowing students to have cell phones in classes. And, uh, you know, this government has banned the use of cell phones in classes, but that doesn't mean [laughter] that doesn't mean that it doesn't happen. as we shall see from this moment in Paul Kandra's news conference. Roll it, please.</p>
</details>

Paul Calandra: 但我女儿给我打电话。她是一名12年级学生，她从课堂上给我打电话，因为她需要一些帮助。我问她：“你在做什么？”你知道，你能帮我一下吗？我说：“但你不应该在课堂上使用手机。”她说：“嗯，就这一次。”我说：“你知道，我是教育部长。我禁止在课堂上使用手机，对吧？”她说：“就这一次。没人会注意到。然后我们能回去吗？”我说：“所以我给了她答案。”嗯，你知道，

<p class="english-text">But my daughter called me. She's a grade 12 student and she called me from her class because she needed help on something. And I asked her, "What are you doing?" You know, can you just help me on on something? I said, "But you're not supposed to have the phone in the class." She says, "Well, it's just for this one thing." I said, "You know, I'm the Minister of Education. I ban phones in the class, right?" Says, "Just for this one thing. Nobody will notice. And then can we go back?" And I said, "So I gave her the answer." Um, you know,</p>

Paul Calandra: 但那不是EQAO。但[笑声]首先，为他的坦白鼓掌，因为他只是一个普通的家长，就像其他孩子从课堂上打电话来，而他们不应该这样做一样。他还是给了答案。嗯，那有点好笑。所以我们只是想播放一下。但是，

Steve Paikin: 好主意。[笑声]好主意。此外，在这次新闻发布会上，保罗·坎德拉（Paul Calandra）提到，包括佩里湾（Perry Sound）、尼帕辛（Nippasing）、北湾（North Bay）在内的**北湾学区**（Near North District School Board: 安大略省的一个学区）是安大略省最新一个被置于所谓“监督之下”的学区。本质上，这意味着我们被接管了，坎德拉先生表示，受托人和董事会成员存在普遍的无能。所以，再次，“最好找保罗”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good call. [laughter] Good call. Now also during this press conference, Paul Kandra mentioned that the Near North District School Board that includes Perry Sound, Nippasing, North Bay, it is the latest school board in the province of Ontario to be put what they call under supervision. Essentially, it means we're taken over and uh Mr. Kandra has suggested that there was widespread incompetence by trustees and board members. So once again, better call Paul.</p>
</details>

### 北湾学区被接管

John Michael McGrath: 是的。现在这是今年该省第六个被置于监督之下的学区，我想，或者说，在这种情况下，争议是……我第一次听说这件事是在八月份，当时我们在**安大略省市政协会**（AMO: Association of Municipalities of Ontario: 代表安大略省各市镇的协会）与TVO一起进行制作。我再次有幸主持了部长论坛，我们称之为“熊坑”，在那里人们向内阁部长们提问，而不是扔烂水果[笑声]。嗯，这个北湾学区的问题就提出来了，因为一位当地的市议员，而不是学区受托人，一位市议员抱怨说，这个学区已经开始建造一所新学校，该学校本应接收高中生。学校还没有准备好。它不会及时在新学年投入使用。所以学区不得不将学生主体送到，至少其中一些被送到了部分拆除的旧学校，而他们正在等待这所新学校的完工。主持部长论坛可能会非常分散注意力。有很多事情发生。但那是我从现场听到这件事的时候，我看着部长，心想：“这不会是我们最后一次听到这个故事。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes. And now this is the sixth board to be placed under supervision in the province this year I guess or um the controversy in this case and and this I first got wind of uh back uh in August when uh we were at AMO uh with the TVO doing the production there. Um I I was once again fortunate enough to um uh moderate the ministers forum what we call the the bear pit where uh people pelt cabinet ministers with questions not rotten fruit [laughter] and um the this came up this issue of uh the near north uh school board because uh a a local municipal counselor, not a school board trustee, a municipal counselor was complaining because this uh uh school board had started construction of a new school that was supposed to accept uh high school students. The school was not ready. It was not going to be ready in time for the new school year. And so uh the school board had to send the uh student body to at least some of them got sent to the partially demolished old school uh while they were waiting for this new school to be complete. And moderating the minister's forum is is like it can be very distracting. There's lots of things going on. But that was one of those times where I heard that from the floor and I looked over at the minister and I was like, "This is not going to be the last time we hear about this story."</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 果然，这个学区是最新一个被置于直接监督之下的。部长随后将任命一名主管来接管，但目前实际上是教育部长直接发布指令。[笑声]

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And sure enough, uh this uh this is, you know, this the latest school board to be put under uh direct supervision. The minister will actually then later name a a a supervisor who will take it over, but at the moment it's literally the minister of education uh issuing the directives uh directly. [laughter]</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 现在会发生什么？嗯，正如我所说，省政府将任命一名主管。他们将不得不进行工作来“拨乱反正”，虽然不完全是“国家之船”，但[笑声]

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And what happens now? Uh well so the the uh as I say the province will appoint a supervisor. Uh they will have to um uh you know undergo the work to to to uh write the ship of not exactly a ship of state but [laughter]</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 市政之船。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">ship of municipality.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 是的。纠正学区的航向。嗯，教育总监，他有点像学区系统内的首席公务员，而不是民选的受托人。本周部长表示，他们已经被停职。嗯，我们之前提到过，主管们也不是免费工作的，而且主管的费用有时会超过导致他们被任命的丑闻的费用。我不知道北湾学区正在发生的一切的具体费用是多少。所以，我不想在这里预先判断结果，但我只是提一下，因为我们之前提到过。嗯，你知道，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. Writing the the the ship of the the school board. Um you know the director of education who is sort of the um the the head civil servant not not an elected trustee uh within the school board system. Uh they have been put on leave according to the minister uh this week. Um, you know, we've mentioned before that the supervisors again, they don't work for free and uh the the costs of the supervisors uh sometimes exceed the costs of the the scandal that prompt them being uh appointed. I I don't know exactly what the costs uh of of everything going on in uh Near North School Board are here. So, I I don't I don't I don't want to prejudge that outcome here, but I I just mentioned it because we've mentioned it before. Um, you know,</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 但你知道主管会得到多少报酬吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but you know what the supervisor is going to get paid?</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 是的，我们知道。如果其他学区的类似做法继续下去，他们每年可以收取高达35万美元。嗯，当然，这一切并非发生在政治真空之中。部长确实提到了他将在新年推出立法，这可能会影响所有至少是英语公立学区的命运。他似乎打算让天主教学校董事会的问题保持不变。那是一个烫手山芋或第三条轨道，他不想触碰。他也不想扰乱法语学校董事会，因为他们有《宪章》保护。但他确实在本周的新闻发布会上再次表示，我试图记住他使用的确切措辞，但大概是说，过去一年他所看到的一切都没有改变他对学校董事会受托人命运的看法，而且学校董事会的治理并没有得到民选受托人的良好服务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yes, we do. That something like that uh they can charge up to $350,000 a year if if uh the similar practice that we saw in other school boards uh will continue. Um and of course, this is not all happening in a political vacuum. Uh the minister did allude to uh legislation he will be be bringing in the new year uh that could affect the fate of all at least English language public school boards. He seems to be uh leaving the question of Catholic school boards alone. That is a hot potato or a third rail he does not want to touch. And he's also uh not wanting to to disrupt French language school boards because they have charter protections. But uh he did say once again uh at this week's press conference that I'm trying to remember the exact wording he used, but it was something like nothing he's seen in the last year has changed his mind about the fate of uh school board trustees and that the the governance of school boards uh does is not being well served by elected trustees.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 我想提出一个观察，那就是如果你回顾一百年前到现在，无论是禁止在学校教授法语的第17号决议，还是1984年将公共资金扩展到天主教学校，还是2007年一位前进步保守党领袖试图向公立学校提供基于信仰的资金，安大略省的宗教、政治和教育的混合很少有好结果。所以你必须小心这一点。当然。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I would make one observation which is if you go back a hundred years and to today whether it was resolution 17 banning the teaching of French in schools whether it was extending public funding to Catholic schools in 1984 whether it was offering faith-based funding to public schools in 2007 as a former progressive conservative party leader tried to do the mixture of religion, politics and education in Ontario rarely ends well. So you got to be careful on that one. Absolutely.</p>

### 专栏回顾：安大略省酒瓶回收系统

John Michael McGrath: 现在是我们的常规专题，你的专栏，我的专栏，JMM和我在这里回顾我们过去一周为**TVO.org**撰写的专栏。你总能找到它们。我们在这里聊聊它们，希望这能鼓励你上网去看看。你这周写了什么想引起我们注意的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Time now for our regular feature, your column, my column, in which JMM and I reminisce about the columns that we wrote for tvO.org over the past week. You can always go find them. We chat about them here in the hopes that it will encourage you to go online and look for them. What did you write about this week you want to bring our attention to?</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 我实际上要谈谈我上周写的一篇专栏，因为我上周没能谈论它。但是政府、**啤酒商店**（The Beer Store: 安大略省主要的啤酒零售商）和杂货店之间达成了一项和解。我们已经关注这个话题一年了。问题是，安大略省的**押金退还计划**（Ontario Deposit Return Program: 安大略省的回收计划，允许消费者退还空啤酒和酒瓶以获得押金）的命运将如何？这个计划允许你将空的啤酒和酒瓶以及易拉罐退还给啤酒商店，取回你的五分钱，这是一个非常成功的回收计划，但随着啤酒和葡萄酒在杂货店和便利店的销售，这成为一个悬而未决的问题。押金退还计划的命运将如何？我们现在知道，杂货店将向啤酒商店支付费用，以继续运营押金退还计划。一方面，政府说：“嘿，这是个好消息。押金退还计划将继续下去。这总是在计划之中的，或者至少是这个计划如何继续下去的一个潜在愿景，基本上就是杂货店向啤酒商店支付费用，让它继续运营这个计划。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm actually going to bring uh a column that I wrote last week in uh because I didn't get to talk about it last week. Uh but the we have a settlement between the government, the beer store and the grocerers. And we've been uh keeping an eye on this topic for a while now, all year. Uh the question was, what would be the fate of the Ontario deposit return program? This is the program that allows you to return empty uh beer and wine bottles and cans to uh the beer store, collect your nickels, and uh it's it's an incredibly successful recycling program, but with the sale of uh beer and wine in uh grocery stores and corner stores, this has been an open question. What would the fate of the deposit return program be? Uh and we we now know that uh grocery stores are going to pay the beer store to continue operating the uh deposit return program. And on the one hand, the government says, "Hey, like this is good news. Deposit return will continue. This was always something that was uh in the cards or at least a a potential vision of how this program would uh continue with basically just the grocery stores paying the beer store to just continue the operations of the program.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 但我提出的问题，也是我在专栏中提出的问题，在我看来更像是一种退却。政府正在大幅扩大每个回收点的服务半径。他们以前似乎说，如果你离啤酒商店超过5公里，杂货店就必须接受空瓶。他们现在说，绝大多数安大略省居民将在10公里范围内找到一个回收点。现在，嗯，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the question that I have and the question I raised in this column uh it looks to me a lot more like a retreat. The government is substantially expanding the uh radius uh that each individual recycling point will be allowed to serve. They used to seem to say that uh if you were more than 5 km away from a beer store that a grocery store would have to accept empties. They're now saying that uh the vast majority of Ontarians will be within 10 kilometers of a recycling point. Uh now uh</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 嗯，这有点深入细节了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well this is getting pretty into the nitty-gritty here.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 嗯，你知道，我们现在在多伦多市中心的央街和埃格林顿。如果我们的脚下有一家啤酒商店，那么这一个地点就可以服务几乎整个多伦多市，啤酒商店就可以说他们符合这个新标准。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, you know, here we are at Young and Eglinton in Toronto in Midtown Toronto. If there were a beer store under our feet, um that single location could be uh could serve almost the entire city of Toronto and and the beer store would get to say that they were in compliance with this new standard. M</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 我其实并不担心多伦多，对吧？我担心的是安大略省北部和农村地区的大多数城镇。这些地方在某些情况下，啤酒商店已经关闭，或者很可能在不久的将来关闭。这些地方你不是在谈论多开10分钟车就能找到一个回收点。你是在谈论根本就没有回收点了。这意味着，正如我所说，这个非常成功的回收计划将在该省的大部分地区停止运作。这将意味着更多的东西最终会进入垃圾填埋场。这最终将由纳税人买单。嗯，也许我有点过于危言耸听了。嗯，也许一切都会好起来，但这是一个我想向读者提出的担忧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm not actually worried about Toronto though, right? What I'm worried about is mostly towns in northern and rural Ontario. We've these are places where uh in some cases the beer stores have already closed down or they are likely to in the near future. And these are places where you're not talking about having to drive an extra 10 minutes to find a recycling point. You're talking about there being no recycling point anymore. And what that means is that this, as I say, this incredibly successful recycling program is going to stop working in big chunks of the province. And that's going to mean that a lot more stuff ends up going to landfills. That is going to be eventually something that is paid for by taxpayers. Um, maybe I'm being overly alarmist. Uh, maybe everything will work out fine, but it is a concern that I thought I would raise for our readers.</p>

### 专栏回顾：肯·德莱顿的纪念

John Michael McGrath: 嗯，我想再谈谈肯·德莱顿（Ken Dryden）。好的。肯·德莱顿，当然是蒙特利尔加拿大人队的名人堂守门员，前多伦多枫叶队主席，前国会议员，前内阁部长，几个月前因癌症意外去世，享年78岁。肯·德莱顿受到了他在国会山的前同事们的缅怀。他在下议院受到了致敬。他在贝尔中心受到了表彰，因为当然，八年六次杯赛冠军。哇。当你成为蒙特利尔加拿大人队的守门员时，你就能得到这个。最近，他受到了他的母校纽约伊萨卡康奈尔大学的表彰。他的艺术与科学学院院长名叫彼得·洛温（Peter Loewen）。彼得以前在多伦多大学蒙克全球事务学院工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, um I wanted to talk about Ken Dryden again. Okay. Ken Dryden, of course, the Hall of Fame goalender for the Montreal Canadians, former president of the Toronto Maple Leafs, former member of Parliament, former cabinet minister, uh died a few months ago quite unexpectedly of cancer, age 78. Ken Dryden has been honored by his former colleagues on Parliament Hill. He was given tributes in the House of Commons. He was honored at the Bell Center because of course six cups in eight years. Wow. We'll get you that when you're the goalender for the Montreal Canadians. And recently he was honored by his alma mater which is Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. The guy who's uh I think the dean of arts and sciences is a guy named Peter Lohen. And Peter used to be at the Monk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 彼得有一天给我打电话说：“你知道，我们要为肯·德莱顿（Ken Dryden）举办一场致敬赛，因为他在这里是如此的明星。”我想肯·德莱顿在康奈尔大学担任了三个赛季的守门员，战绩大约是80胜3负1平。大概是这样。数字可能有点偏差，但就是这么戏剧性。所以他说：“我们要为他举办一场盛大的致敬活动。你想下来和我一起看比赛吗？”我想：“当然想。”于是，我开了五个小时的车去伊萨卡看这场比赛。肯的存在遍布整个体育馆，对吧？他是在1960年代在那里打球的，所以已经是很久以前的事了。他的存在遍布整个体育馆。我们开始吧。我们将通过一些图片，我将为那些通过播客收听的人描述我们在这里看到的内容。这些是康奈尔大学主场体育馆的椽子，你知道，在ECAC冠军旗帜等等之中。那里有为肯·德莱顿退役的一号球衣。他在蒙特利尔加拿大人队穿的是29号，但在康奈尔大学是1号。他是康奈尔大学退役球衣的仅有的两名NHL球员之一。乔·纽恩代克（Joe Newandike）和Xle Leaf是另一个。我们再仔细看看。一号，德莱顿在椽子上。它非常显眼。你一走进去就不会错过。如果你看看体育馆的墙壁、大厅等等。那里有肯他非常著名的姿势，下巴搁在手套上，曲棍球杆直立着。我们还有什么？那里有德莱顿的一号。大楼里其他地方还有一面旗帜表明这一点。墙上还有另一张照片。这些照片遍布整个体育馆。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Peter called me up one day and he said, "You know, we're going to do a tribute game to Ken Dryden because he was such a star here." I think Ken Dryden was the goalender for three seasons at Cornell and had a record of something like 80 wins, three losses, and one tie. Something like that. I might be a tiny bit off on the numbers, but it's it's that dramatic. So, he said, "We're going to do a a big tribute to him. Do you want to come down and and see the game with me?" I thought, "Damn right I do." So, drove five hours to go to Ithaca for this game. Ken's presence is all over the arena, right? He played there in the 1960s, so it's been a long time. His presence is all over the arena. Here we go. We're going to go through some pictures and I'll describe for those listening on on podcast what we're seeing here. These are the rafters in the arena in Cornell's home arena and you know among the ECAC championship banners and so on. There's number one retired for Ken Dryden. He wore 29 with the Habs but number one at Cornell. One of only two NHL players to have their numbers retired by Cornell. Joe Newandike and Xle Leaf being the other one. And let's take a there's a closer look at it. Number one, Dryen in the rafters. It just stands out. You can't miss it when you walk in. And if you look at the walls of the arena in the lobbies and so on. There's Ken with his very famous pose, chin on top of his gloves as the hockey stick is standing straight up. And what else we got? There's Dryden's number one. Another pennant somewhere else in the building indicating that. And another picture on the walls as well. These pictures are all over the arena.</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 这就是，我想它没有大到可以称之为巨型屏幕，但它是一个相当大的屏幕。在实际的体育馆内，他们播放了一段两分钟的肯在役精彩视频。看他当时多年轻啊。天哪。无论如何，那是他们在那里做的一件事。你知道，在冰球比赛开始时，他们经常会进行一个象征性的开球仪式，这次是肯的一位朋友出来开球，通常是由球队队长来做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This was the I guess it's not so big that I should call it a jumbotron, but it's a fairly big screen. Inside the actual arena itself, they ran a two-minute uh video of highlights of Ken's time. Look how young he looked there. Boy, my goodness. Anyway, that was uh something they did there. You know, at the beginning of a hockey game, they do a ceremonial puck drop often and it was a friend of Ken who came out to drop the puck and normally the team captains do it.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 这次他们让守门员来做，这真是太棒了。他们让两名守门员出来开球。康奈尔大学的守门员，他的姓氏是科诺（Corno），

<p class="english-text">to those of us who watched and were occasionally um destroyed by how well the Habs played in the 1970s,</p>

John Michael McGrath: 伊冯·科诺（Yvon Cournoyer）是蒙特利尔加拿大人队的前队长，也是肯·德莱顿（Ken Dryden）的队友。所以，守门员开球，他的姓氏是科诺，我觉得这很神奇。那是肯的儿子迈克尔（Michael），他拿着一件球队送给他的荣誉一号德莱顿球衣。那是我穿着枫叶队球衣，因为我不会穿加拿大人队的球衣，即使是为了德莱顿。[笑声]那是我穿着枫叶队球衣，那是肯的遗孀琳达·德莱顿（Linda Dryden），她也参加了比赛，还有他的儿子迈克尔和女儿莎拉（Sarah），以及迈克尔的一个孩子布雷克（Blake），他们都参加了在纽约伊萨卡的比赛，那是一个非常美好的夜晚，向肯·德莱顿致敬。所以，专栏就是关于这一切的。还有一件事，既然我们谈到已故的朋友，皇后公园有一个传统，当一位前立法委员去世时，所有政党的成员都会起立，发表大约五分钟的悼词，向他们致敬。本周，吉姆·布拉德利（Jim Bradley）也受到了这样的致敬。他是皇后公园史上第二位任期最长的省议员，在安大略省立法机构任职超过40年。布拉德利先生当然在他今年早些时候去世时是尼亚加拉地区的**主席**（Chair: 地区政府的领导职位）。嗯，他接受了医疗协助死亡，本周早些时候在皇后公园，人们对他说了许多美好的话。让我们看看。谢尔顿（Shelton），如果你愿意的话。

[laughter] There's me with my Leaf jersey and that's Linda Dryden, Ken's widow, who was at the game as was his, as you just saw, son, Michael, and daughter Sarah. and one of Michael's kids, Blake, they were all at the game at Ithaca, New York, and it was a wonderful, wonderful evening in tribute to Ken Dryden. So there, and the column is about all of that. And one more thing, as long as we're speaking of the dear departed among us, there is a tradition at Queens Park where when a former member of the legislature dies, members of all the parties get up and say, you know, five minutes of tribute, pay five minutes of tribute to them. And that happened this week for Jim Bradley. uh the second longest serving MPP of all time at Queens Park, more than 40 years a member of the Ontario legislature. Mr. Bradley, of course, was chair of Niagara region when he died earlier this year. Um uh underwent medical assistance in dying and uh there was lots of lovely things said about him at Queens Park earlier this week. Let's have a look at that. Shelton, if you would.</p>

### 专栏回顾：吉姆·布拉德利悼念

Steve Paikin: 我无法告诉你，多年来我曾有幸与多少布拉德利团队的成员在环境问题上合作，他们都告诉我他们受到了吉姆的启发。我有幸参加了吉姆的生平庆祝活动，我想在这里记录下我那天告诉史蒂夫·帕金（Steve Paikin）的话，我引用迈克·施赖纳（Mike Schreiner）的话：“吉姆·布拉德利（Jim Bradley）在皇后公园还没有绿党的时候，就是绿党的领袖。”

<details>

<p class="english-text">I can't tell you how many members of the Bradley gang who I've had the privilege of working with on environmental issues over the years who told me they were inspired by Jim. I had the honor of attending Jim's celebration of life and I want to put on the record what I told Steve Pacin that day and I quote Mike Shriner. Jim Bradley was the leader of the Green Party before there was a Green Party of Queens Park.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 今天我站起来，我们与圣凯瑟琳社区和尼亚加拉地区站在一起，缅怀一位用他的每一步、每一次握手、每一张便条和每一个时刻塑造了我们的城市和我们省的人。半个多世纪以来，尊敬的詹姆斯·约瑟夫·吉姆·布拉德利（James Joseph Jim Bradley）不仅仅服务于圣凯瑟琳，他热爱圣凯瑟琳。作为回报，圣凯瑟琳也深爱着他。可以肯定地说，吉姆·布拉德利的遗产、他的领导力以及他留下的东西，对尼亚加拉地区的影响比过去一个世纪的任何其他政治家都要大。吉姆是一位绅士。他是一个谦逊的人。他是一个有信仰、有信念的人，对他的社区和选民有着不懈的兴趣。他是一个以一生服务和卓越来定义的人，而且他始终是一个善良的人。吉姆内心充满爱。你可以看出来，因为他确保人们收到圣诞贺卡。他不会忘记事情。他关心人们。是的，他可能脾气暴躁，粗鲁，直言不讳，但他的核心是有一颗宽广的心。他对这个地方有着宽广的心。他对圣凯瑟琳和整个尼亚加拉地区，乃至整个安大略省的人民都有着宽广的心。我非常自豪能说几句话，并称他为朋友和同事。我要感谢他的家人与我们分享他。他是一个伟大的人。他是独一无二的。永远不会再有另一个吉姆·布拉德利了。嗯，这没关系。

<p class="english-text">Today I rise and we stand with the community of St. Catherine and the region of Niagara to honor a man who shaped our city and our province with every step he took, every hand he shook, and every note he wrote and and every moment he gave. For more than half a century, the Honorable James Joseph Jim Bradley didn't just serve St. Catherine's, he loved St. Cathine's. And in return, St. Cathine's loved him right back. It's safe to say that Jim Bradley's legacy, his leadership, and what he left behind has had a greater mark on the Niagara region than any other politician for the past century. Jim was a gentleman. He was a humble man. He was a man of faith and of conviction, of tireless interest in his community and his constituents. He was a man defined by a lifetime of service and excellence, and unfailingly a kind man. Jim was just all heart inside. He was, you can tell because he made sure people got Christmas cards. He didn't forget things. He cared about people. Yeah, he could be grumpy and rough and speak his mind, but at his core, he had a big heart. He had a big heart for this place. And he had a big heart for the people in St. Catherine's and all of Niagara and indeed all of Ontario. And I I am just so proud to be able to say a few words and uh to call him a friend and colleague. I want to say thank you to the family for sharing him with us. Uh he was a great man. He's unique. There will never ever ever be another Jim Bradley. Um and that's okay. Thank you very much. [applause]</p>

### 读者来信：火焰之环项目

John Michael McGrath: 嗯，今天我们收到了一封来自安派尔（Armpire）的莫里斯·奥肖内西（Maurice O'Shaughnessy）的信。史蒂夫和JMM，在道格关于美国关税的广告之前，他一直在播放关于“火焰之环”的广告。我发现这个广告是妄想的，因为有一两个**原住民部落**（First Nations: 加拿大原住民群体之一）反对这项开发，而且**阿达瓦皮斯卡特原住民部落**（Adawapiskat First Nation: 加拿大安大略省的一个原住民部落）已经在该地区设立了一个营地，并且显然正在阻止那里的任何当前活动。那么，道格·福特（Doug Ford）计划如何解决这个小问题以及这个广告所激发的期望呢？来自安大略省普赖尔（Prior）的莫里斯·奥肖内西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh, today we have a letter from Maurice Oshanaughy in Armpire. Steve and JMM, before Doug's commercial on US tariffs, he was running ads on the ring of fire. I found this ad delusional as the one or two of the First Nations oppose this development and the Adaposiscat First Nation has already set up a camp in the area and are apparently blocking any current activity there. So, how does Doug Ford plan to get around this little problem and the expectations inspired by this ad? Mauricio Shaughnessy on Prior Ontario.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 嗯，以防不是所有正在观看或收听我们节目的人都看过或听过这个广告，我们为什么不先播放一下呢？当然。谢尔顿（Shelton），如果你愿意的话。当加拿大面临经济[音乐]不确定性时，我们有一个计划来确保我们的未来。它始于**火焰之环**（Ring of Fire: 安大略省北部一个富含矿产的地区）。通过与原住民部落合作开发[音乐]这片土地，我们将为原住民社区创造经济增长。这就是我们[音乐]保护安大略省的方式。来自火焰之环。现在，公平地说，奥肖内西先生，是奥肖内西先生吗？是这个名字还是奥内斯？对不起。公平地说，奥肖内西先生，省长的政府已经与沿着火焰之环拟议路线的几个原住民社区签署了几项协议。马丁瀑布（Martin Falls）、韦布基（Webquay）、埃罗兰（Aeroland）原住民部落是最近的例子。对采矿开发存在显著的抵制。让我们记录下来。阿达瓦皮斯卡特（Adawapcat）和**内斯坎塔加原住民部落**（Neskantaga First Nation: 加拿大安大略省的一个原住民部落）的成员已经在拟议中的一座桥梁附近建立了一个定居点，这座桥梁将连接火焰之环与福特政府希望修建的道路。那么政府实际上在做什么呢？我的意思是，那些广告，你知道，有很多欢快的音乐和行动的画面，你知道，等等等等，政府正在做什么来使这个广告成为现实？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, just in case not everybody who is watching or listening to us right now has seen or heard this ad, why don't we play that first? Absolutely. Shelton, if you would. As Canada faces economic [music] uncertainty, we have a plan to secure our future. And it starts in the Ring of Fire. By developing [music] the land in partnership with First Nations, we'll create economic growth for indigenous communities. That's how we [music] protect Ontario. Made from the Ring of Fire. Now, in fairness to Mr. Shaughnessy, is it Mr. Shaughnessy? Is that the name or Oness? Excuse me. In fairness to Mr. O Shanosy the premier's government has inked several deals with several first nations community along the proposed route into the ring of fire. Martin Falls Webquay Aeroland first nations as the most recent examples. There is significant resistance to mining developments. Let's put that on the record. Members from Adawapcat and Neskantaga First Nations have created a settlement near to a proposed bridge that would link the Ring of Fire to roads that the Ford government is hoping to build. So what's the government actually I mean those ads are you know lots of upbeat music and pictures of action and you know yada yada yada what's the government doing to make this ad a reality?</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 嗯，如果我能把这放在背景中，我的意思是，我们谈论的是北部的一个地区，那里至少有六个，我想在某些时候多达20个原住民部落参与了各种讨论，因为它不仅仅是直接通往火焰之环的道路问题。我们谈论的是一个连接网络，其中将包括许多其他原住民部落。当有这么多方参与时，谈判会变得非常复杂。所以本届政府所做的一件事，与温（Wynne）政府相比，我想说他们试图推动谈判进展的一种方式是真正专注于一对一的谈判。他们没有签署大型的，你知道，20人或20个政党的协议，涉及多个原住民部落。他们是同时与一两个原住民部落达成协议。嗯，就这一点而言，

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, if I could just put this in context, I mean, we're talking about a part of the North where there have been uh certainly no less than six and I think at some points uh as many as 20 First Nations involved in various discussions because it's not just a question of uh you know a road directly to uh the Ring of Fire itself. We're talking about a network of uh connections that would include lots of other First Nations. And when you have that many parties involved, negotiations get very complicated. And so one of the things this government has done in contrast to uh the win government, I would say one of their uh one of the ways they've tried to move negotiations forward is really focus on like one-on-one negotiations. Like they're not signing big, you know, 20 uh person agree or 20 uh uh party agreements with multiple First Nations. They're like nailing an agreement with one one or two First Nations at a time. Um and on that point,</p>
</details>

John Michael McGrath: 金钱在政治中解决了很多问题，对吧？马丁瀑布（Martin Falls）和韦布基（WebRe）原住民部落都获得了近4000万美元，以换取他们希望修建的拟议道路的环境评估。嗯，当然我们谈论的是全季节道路。省政府确实资助北部的冬季道路。但是火焰之环为偏远原住民部落带来的经济承诺之一是让他们连接到永久性道路网络，一个在夏季也能使用的网络。冬季道路季节由于气候变化而变得越来越短，但这又是另一个播客的话题了。嗯，在马丁瀑布，他们还在寻求资金来升级基础设施，包括一个废水处理设施。马丁瀑布显然已经有19年处于**烧水公告**（boil water advisory: 建议居民在饮用或使用自来水前将其煮沸的公共卫生通知）之下。嗯，处理原住民保留地水质问题通常不是省政府的责任。那通常是联邦政府的责任，当然联邦政府一直在努力解决保留地的水质问题。但省政府的钱和联邦政府的钱一样好用。所以他们将获得一些资金用于那个废水处理设施。所以一些社区正在达成协议，但另一些社区没有。那么我们现在处于什么状况呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">money solves a lot of problems in politics, right? Uh both Martin Falls and the WebRe First Nation received close to $40 million in exchange uh for environmental assessments for the proposed roads that they are looking to build. Um of course the we're talking about allseason roads. Uh the province does fund winter roads in the north. Uh but the one of the the economic promises that the Ring of Fire holds for uh remote First Nations is getting them connected to a permanent road network, something that will uh last in the summer. Uh the the winter road season keeps getting shorter and shorter thanks to climate change, but that's a whole other podcast. Um in Martin Falls, they are also uh looking at money to upgrade uh infrastructure, including a uh a wastewater facility. Uh Martin Falls has been under a boil water advisory for 19 years apparently. Um it's not normally provincial responsibility to deal with on reserve water quality issues. That is usually a federal responsibility and of course the federal government has been trying to make progress on uh water quality issues on reserves. But provincial money spends just as easily as federal money. So they are going to uh get some money for uh again that wastewater facility. So some deals are being made with some communities but others not. So where are we at?</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 没错。所以一些不同的原住民部落要求建立永久性的环境保护措施。我们谈论的是该省的一个地区，那里有大量的**泥炭地**（peat lands: 一种湿地生态系统，土壤中富含未完全分解的有机物质）。这些是凉爽的湿地地区，它们在土壤中封存了大量的碳。但是当你挖开这些土壤以获取下面的贵金属时，你可能会释放出大量被锁在其中的碳。嗯，我还要指出，地球变暖也会从泥炭地释放出大量的碳。这一切都有些讽刺，因为我们最近用来证明开发火焰之环合理性的原因之一，就是需要获取关键矿物，其中包括电动汽车所需的矿物。所以我们正在使地球变绿，或者至少使我们的工业变绿，但在该省一些环境敏感的地区，也许有办法让工业以不那么破坏性的方式前进，就像一些原住民部落所担心的那样。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Right. So some uh different first nations have asked for uh permanent environmental protections to be put in place. We are talking about a part of the province where uh there's um uh a great deal of pete lands. Uh these are areas of uh uh you know cooler wetlands that that sequester a bunch of carbon in the soil. Uh but as you break open those soils to get at you know precious metals underneath uh you can release a lot of the carbon uh that is is locked up in there. Um I will also point out that uh a warming earth will also release a lot of carbon from the pete lands. This is all kind of ironic given that one of the uh most recent reasons we've used to uh uh justify the the exploitation of of the ring of fire uh is about the need to uh get critical minerals for among others electric vehicles. Uh so we are uh greening the earth but or greening our industry at least but uh in uh parts of the province where there are undeniable environmental sensitivities um maybe there are ways for industry to to move forward in ways that are not uh disruptive and destructive as some of these First Nations fear.</p>
</details>

Steve Paikin: 政府对此非常积极，我不太清楚他们是否会等待所有环境细节都得到遵守。当然，省政府确实将火焰之环作为一个重点区域，他们希望利用他们在**第5号法案**（Bill 5: 安大略省政府通过的一项旨在加快某些项目的审批流程）下赋予自己的权力来加快环境审批流程，同时，例如，当我们谈论原住民土地时，他们豁免了，或者说第5号法案允许他们豁免项目免于考古评估。所以，这与原住民如此相关的一个原因是，人们担心会扰乱传统的原住民墓地，以及根据省法律，人们应该获得什么样的义务。目前，如果你在安大略省的任何地方挖掘并发现人类遗骸，我的意思是，如果它看起来像是一个原住民墓地，你必须停止并进行评估。至少在理论上，第5号法案将允许在火焰之环开设矿山，而无需关注这类事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh the government is pretty gung-ho about this stuff and it's not entirely clear to me that they're going to wait for uh uh all of the environmental nicities to be observed. Uh and of course uh both the uh certainly the provincial government has has really highlighted the ring of fire as uh an area where they want to use the powers they gave themselves under Bill 5 uh to to expedite um both uh the environmental approvals side of things while also for example and while we're talking about indigenous lands here uh they exempted or bill 5 allows them to exempt projects from uh things like uh archaeological assessments right so one reason why this so relevant to indigenous uh people is that like uh there's concerns about disrupting um uh traditional indigenous uh burial sites and what kind of obligations people would be owed under provincial law. Currently, if you're digging anywhere in Ontario and you you you find human remains, I mean, if it looks like it could be an indigenous burial site, you've got to stop and you've got to assess that um at least in theory, Bill Five would allow uh a mine in the Ring of Fire to be opened without paying attention to that kind of thing.</p>
