title: Netflix斥资827亿美元收购华纳兄弟，流媒体格局巨变；SoFi意外增发引市场热议
---

### 市场开盘概览：等待关键通胀数据

大家早上好，欢迎回到新一期的市场开盘直播。今天是12月5日，星期五。这一周过得漫长又迅速，12月的第一个交易周即将在今天收盘时结束。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. We are live. It is Friday, December 5th. It's been a long week, but it's also been a very fast week. And the first week of December trading is going to be ending today as we get into the market open.</p>
</details>

今天早上有几条重磅新闻。首先是9月份的**PCE**（Personal Consumption Expenditures：个人消费支出）数据，这是美联储首选的通胀衡量指标。通常，PCE数据应该在发布日的早上8:30公布。但由于9月份政府停摆，数据推迟到今天上午10点发布。所以，大约一小时后，我们将了解到9月份PCE的具体情况。我不确定这份三个月前的旧数据会对市场当下的通胀预期产生多大影响。通常PCE数据确实有影响力，但这次情况特殊。我们得看看市场在10点数据出来后是否会对此作出反应。目前，美联储期货市场预测的降息概率是87.2%，昨天是89%。所以这仍然是一个重要的数据，我们将拭目以待。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We got a bunch of headlines this morning. Number one is PCE for September, which is the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, usually is out at 8:30 a.m. on the days that PCE is supposed to come out. The government was shut down during September. So, it's coming out at 10:00 a.m. today. So, in about an hour, we're going to get some details on what the PCE for September looks like. I don't know how much of an impact it's going to have in terms of how the market's thinking of inflation. Usually PCE does have an impact, but this is three months old data. So, we're going to have to see if the market does react to that react to that when it comes out at 10 a.m. The Fed futures probabilities right now is 87.2. It was 89 yesterday. So, that is an important piece of data and we'll see what happens when that comes out.</p>
</details>

### 行业巨震：Netflix斥资827亿美元收购华纳兄弟

另一条重磅新闻显然是Netflix以720亿美元收购华纳兄弟探索公司。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other big headline obviously Netflix buying Warner Brothers Discovery for $72 billion.</p>
</details>

我们整个星期都在讨论这件事。如果Netflix能够成功收购，这绝对引起了我的关注。实际上，交易的股权价值为720亿美元，总价值达到827亿美元。这其中有很多细节值得我们深入分析，探讨它对整个流媒体行业格局意味着什么。我知道Netflix的股价在盘前下跌了，因为如果你要花费800亿美元，华尔街显然不会太高兴。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh we've been talking about this all week. It is definitely caught my attention uh if Netflix were to be able to acquire them. Actually, it's 82.7 billion equity value of 72 billion. Uh there's a lot to break down and dive into and see kind of what this means for the overall streaming landscape. Uh, I know Netflix stock is down in the pre-markets because obviously if you're going to be spending $80 billion, Street's not going to be the happiest about it, but um,</p>
</details>

我暂时还不会抄底。我需要分析债务状况，以及我认为Netflix将如何处理这些债务。如果你不想深究细节，只是认为Netflix将成为垄断者，那么或许现在是买入时机。另一个问题是，我认为Netflix可能会面临监管障碍。不过话说回来，如果他们认为交易无法完成，我想他们也不会发起这笔交易。他们有一些独特的论点来证明自己不会形成垄断。比如，从互联网整体来看，YouTube的观看时长比Netflix更多。所以他们的论点是，他们不是在与流媒体公司竞争，而是在与像YouTube和Google这样拥有海量在线观众的科技公司竞争，或者像亚马逊旗下的Twitch。所以我认为，关于竞争的论证存在一些微妙之处。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm not buying the dip yet. I need to analyze the debt profile, how I think Netflix is going to navigate the debt. If you don't want to get that deep into the details and you just think Netflix is going to be monopoly, I mean, maybe this is a buy. The other problem is the the regulatory hurdle that I think Netflix might face. Now, granted, I don't think they did this deal if they didn't think they would be able to get the job done. there's some unique ways that they um basically argued that they would not have a monopoly because if you look at the internet, YouTube has more watch time than Netflix. So like their argument is, hey, we're not competing with the streamers, we're competing with like the tech companies like YouTube and Google that have this like massive massive audience online or Twitch with Amazon. So I think there's some nuance to how you make the competition argument, but my gut feeling tells me this is good for Netflix.</p>
</details>

但我的直觉告诉我，这对Netflix是件好事。我们稍后会更详细地讨论，但我确实认为，他们获得的内容量，以及他们将永久拥有的**IP**（Intellectual Property：知识产权），再加上新增的四五千万订阅用户，这将是一笔非常重要的交易。所以，这是我们将要讨论和深入探讨的一个头条新闻。看起来这会相当重要。我们还有一些关于英伟达芯片的新闻要谈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but my gut feeling tells me this is good for Netflix. like and and we we'll talk a lot more about it in a bit, but I I really do think the types of content they're getting and the IP that they will have forever on that platform in and and in the subscriber editions, which they should be adding 40 50 million subscribers, should be a big deal. So, uh that is a headline that we will talk about and get into. It seems like that is going to be relatively important. We have some Nvidia chip headlines as well that we'll get into.</p>
</details>

### SoFi意外增发引争议：管理层意图何在？

哦，还有SoFi的增发事件。昨晚我看了看，我认为问题不大。我知道很多人因为SoFi的做法感到愤怒。你看，这个时机确实有点奇怪，尤其是在节假日前，人们会有些不快。但股价只跌了5%，回到了上周的水平。我认为这不算什么大事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Oh, the the SoFi dilution thing. Look, I looked at it last night. I don't think it's that big of a deal. I know a lot of people are pissed off because of uh what SoFi is doing with it. Look, it is a little bit weird timing, especially before the holidays. People are kind of upset, but like stock's down 5%. Stock was where it was at last week. I don't think it's that big of a deal.</p>
</details>

在深入讨论Netflix之前，我先简单谈谈SoFi。我相信管理层明白他们为什么要做这次增发。好吧，现在股价跌了7%。很多人有一种理论，认为他们应该等到被纳入标普500指数之后再行动，因为那样可以获得更好的价格，用更少的稀释来筹集同样数额的资本。这次融资大约是15亿美元。我不知道，而且我认为SoFi自己也不知道是否一定能进入标普500。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I am trusting I'll just talk about SoFi real quickly before we get into Netflix. I am trusting Well, okay. So is now 7%. I would trust that management understands why they're diluting. A lot of people have this theory that, oh, they should have waited until after the S&P 500 because then they would have got a better price. They would have had less dilution to raise the same amount of capital. It was about 1.5 billion. I don't I don't uh know and I don't think SoFi knows if they're definitely going to get into the S&P,</p>
</details>

顺便说一下，今天东部时间下午5:15会公布标普500的调整结果，届时我会直播。我想Steve会和我一起，我们等着看SoFi最终是否会被宣布纳入。但我认为这次增发与标普的公告无关。我认为他们只是急需这笔钱来做某件事。他们在做什么？我不知道。有人会说肯定是为了收购，但很多人又说不是收购。那么是为了偿还一些可转换票据吗？也许吧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">which I'll be live today. The S&P announcement is at 5:15 p.m. Eastern. So, I think Steve will join me and we'll we'll wait and see if SoFi ends up getting announced. But I don't think this was contingent on the S&P announcement. I think they just really needed the money to do something. What are they doing? I don't know. One would argue it has to be an acquisition, but a lot of people are saying it's not an acquisition. So, is it paying off some of the convertible notes? Maybe.</p>
</details>

这确实有点奇怪，因为在之前的炉边谈话中，他们说并不真正需要资本。80天前的财报日，他们也说不需要任何资本，然后就在盘后宣布了增发。是的，这很奇怪。但这时候，你必须相信Noto（SoFi CEO）知道自己在做什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Um, it is a bit weird because at the fireside chat, they said they didn't really need capital. The day of earnings 80 days ago, they said they didn't need any capital and then, you know, after hours they they diluted. So, yeah, it's weird. But this is where you've got to trust that not actually knows what he's doing.</p>
</details>

更不用说，Noto有大笔的激励薪酬在等着他，股价需要达到45美元甚至35美元才能解锁。这次增发理论上会阻碍股价轻松达到那些目标价位。他只剩下几个月的时间来维持这些股价目标，以便能够解锁我认为大约是5亿美元的奖励。所以我猜想，他认为他们用这15亿美元要做的事情是有增值效应的。他们比我更清楚，但我认为这事没那么严重。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Not not to mention Noto has a lot of money that's waiting for him at $45 and uh and even at $35. So the dilution stops the stock theoretically from easily getting to those tanches. He only has a couple months left to really sustain those uh price targets to be able to get I think it's like $500 million he would unlock. So I I would imagine he thinks this thing that they're going to do with the 1.5 billion is a creative they know better than me, but I don't think it's that big of a deal.</p>
</details>

我不知道这是否是大事。比如，如果我重仓SoFi，我不会惊慌失措。这对SoFi的投资者来说烦人吗？是的。我的意思是，这是他们第二次这样做了。上一次增发是12亿还是9.99亿美元来着。这一次是15亿。在五个月内筹集这么多钱确实有点奇怪，而且他们还没有宣布任何重大收购。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't know if it's that big. Like I wouldn't freak out if I'm heavy into SoFi. Um is it annoying for SoFi investors? Yes. I mean, you know, this is the second time they've done the last dilution was what 1.2 or 999 million something like that. This one is 1.5. It is kind of weird to raise that much money in the span of five months. And they haven't announced a major acquisition yet.</p>
</details>

所以我个人对他们为什么这么做感到困惑。但我认为这是SoFi的末日吗？不，我不认为这是世界末日或类似的可怕事情。但我能理解为什么人们感到恼火，我懂。不过我不会去抄底。我的意思是，要说抄底，这支股票两周前还在23美元。所以要让我对抄底更兴奋，股价需要再跌很多。现在，如果你认为他们会进入标普500指数之类的，那也许可以赌一把。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I am personally confused why they're doing it. Do I think it's the end of SoFi? No, I don't think it's the end of the world or anything like crazy like that. But I can understand why people are annoyed and I get it. I I wouldn't be buying the dip though. I mean like I for a dip by this thing was at 23 two weeks ago. So like for a dip by this thing needs to get down a lot more to get more excited. Now if you think they're going to get into the S&P or something then maybe you take a swing at it.</p>
</details>

但在这里我唯一能提供的分析是，因为没人知道他们到底为什么要这么做，所以你必须相信管理层对于这次增发将如何发展，以及为什么他们想在当前这个价位进行，是有想法的。另外，高盛是这次发行的承销商，而Noto与高盛关系匪浅。所以我想他想要一个能有效完成这次融资的承销商，以帮助他们实现下一步的目标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But yeah, the only analysis I can really provide here because no one knows what the hell they're doing this for is that you've got to trust that management has an idea of how the dilution is going to play out and why they wanted to do it specifically at these prices. Also, Goldman is underwriting it and you know not ties to Goldman. So, I would imagine he wanted an underwriter that could effectively do this capital raise to to get to the next step of what they want to do.</p>
</details>

但是，SoFi正处于试图弄清楚如何在其业务中获得巨大经营杠杆的阶段。他们如何将这种经营杠杆实际转化为股东回报？这只股票今年已经表现得非常好了。然后，这次增发如何能产生增值效应？我们将拭目以待，看这次增发是否最终能带来有意义的结果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But, you know, SoFi is in the midst of trying to figure out how do they gain massive operating leverage in the business? How do they actually use that operating leverage to turn into shareholder returns? The shock has already done very well this year. And then how can this dilution be creative? And we're going to see if this dilution ends up actually doing something meaningful.</p>
</details>

我想唯一的另一种看空情况是，是的，他们有一些不良贷款，拖欠率比预期的要高得多，所以他们需要筹集更多资本。考虑到SoFi的承销质量，我对此深表怀疑，但我想我们会在未来几个月内找出他们最终进行这次增发的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I guess the only other bare case is that yeah, they have some bad loans and they have a lot more delinquencies than expected, so they need to raise more cap. I really doubt it given SoFi's underwriting quality, but I guess we're going to find out over the uh over the coming months why they ended up doing this dilution.</p>
</details>

### 回到Netflix：一场定义未来十年的收购

好了，Netflix，这里发生了什么？这是Netflix CEO泰德·萨兰多斯的一段引述：“我们的使命一直是娱乐世界。通过将华纳兄弟令人难以置信的节目和电影库——从《卡萨布兰卡》和《公民凯恩》这样的永恒经典（顺便说一句，这两部都是非常棒的电影，如果你没看过，那你还在等什么？）到《哈利·波特》和《老友记》这样的现代热门——与我们自己定义文化的影片如《怪奇物语》、《K-pop：恶魔猎人》和《鱿鱼游戏》相结合，我们将能够做得更好。携手合作，我们可以为观众提供更多他们喜爱的内容，并帮助定义下一个世纪的叙事方式。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay, Netflix, what is going on here? So, here's a quote from uh Ted Sandrano, CEO of Netflix. Our mission has always been to entertain the world by combining Warner Bros. incredible library of shows and movies from timeless classics like Casablanca and Citizen Kane. By the way, both incredible movies. If you haven't watched Casablanca or Citizen Kane, what are you doing? To modern favorites like Harry Potter and Friends with our culture defining titles like Stranger Things, K-pop, Demon Hunters, and Squid Game, we'll be able to do that even better. Together, we can give audiences more of what they love and help define the next century of storytelling.</p>
</details>

他接着说：“这次收购将改善我们的产品，并在未来几十年加速我们的业务发展。”我认为他们是对的。在未来几十年里，这将是Netflix一个非常丰富的内容库。华纳兄弟定义了一个多世纪的娱乐业，并凭借其卓越的创意高管和制作能力继续这样做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh he goes on to continue, "The acquisition will improve our offering and accelerate our business for decades to come." And I think they're right. Like for the next decades, this is going to be a content library that is very rich for Netflix. Warner Bros. has defined entertainment for more than a century and continues to do so with phenomenal creative executives and production capabilities.</p>
</details>

“凭借全球覆盖和成熟的商业模式，我们可以将他们创造的世界介绍给更广泛的观众，为我们的会员提供更多选择，吸引更多粉丝加入我们一流的流媒体服务，并为整个娱乐行业增强实力，为股东创造更多价值。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">With a global reach and proven business model, we can introduce a broader audience to the worlds they create, giving our members more options, attracting more fans to our best-in-class streaming service, and strengthening the entire industry for entertainment and creating more value for shareholders.</p>
</details>

我认为这是一笔好交易。我之前订阅HBO Max的原因之一就是因为他们拥有比Netflix好得多的知识产权。你有所有DC电影，比如蝙蝠侠系列。我终于可以随时在Netflix上看《黑暗骑士》了。还有《老友记》，这本身就是巨大的资产。所有的《哈利·波特》，也是巨大的资产。还有《硅谷》、《生活大爆炸》。我的意思是，太多人们喜爱的经典剧集现在都要登陆Netflix了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think this is a good deal, man. Like I the one of the reasons I subscribed to HBO Max a while ago was just because they have way better intellectual property than Netflix. You have all the DC movies when it comes to Batman. I'll finally be able to watch The Dark Knight whenever I want on Netflix. Uh Friends, that in of itself is massive. All the Harry Potter, that's massive. Got Silicon Valley, Big Bang Theory. I mean, just so many classic shows that people love are now going to Netflix.</p>
</details>

问题在于这笔交易的单位经济效益。看空这笔交易的理由是，Netflix昨晚提出了全现金报价，并且提高了报价，超过了派拉蒙的报价。他们说，大约85%是现金，即每股WBD股票支付23美元现金，外加价值4美元的Netflix股票。现在华纳兄弟的股价并没有大幅上涨，只涨了3%，但还没到收购价，因为我认为很多人仍在怀疑这笔交易能否通过。所以这里存在一点套利空间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The the question is the unit economics on this deal. The bare case to this is Netflix gave an allcash offer last night and they upped it from whatever Paramount Paramount offered and they said we'll do or it's about 85% of its cash and like it's $23 cash per uh WBD stock and then um $4 a share of Netflix stock. Now Warner Brothers is not necessarily pumping. It's up 3% but it's not at the acquisition price because I think a lot of people are still wondering will this go through? So there is a little bit of an arbitrage there.</p>
</details>

这里的看空观点是，有人可能会说Netflix是出于绝望才出这么高的价钱。他们之所以可能变得绝望——Netflix股价下跌了3.5%——是因为他们在广告和订阅用户方面的实际业务正在放缓。记住，他们已经不再公布订阅用户数量了。他们意识到，在未来五年内，他们无法创造出那么多像《K-pop：恶魔猎人》和《鱿鱼游戏》这样的爆款，来真正地吸引下一波订阅用户，这不可避免地意味着他们无法获得下一波收入增长。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the the uh bare case here is that Netflix got one could argue Netflix became desperate to offer this much money and the reason they might be becoming desperate Netflix right here down 3.5% is because their actual business on an advertising and subscriber side is slowing remember they don't report subscribers anymore and they are realizing that there's not that many K-pop demon hunters and Squid Games for them to be able to create over the next five years to meaningfully get that next surge of subscribers, which inevitably means they're not going to get that next surge of revenue.</p>
</details>

而Netflix的估值倍数，坦率地说，是其他媒体娱乐公司无法想象的。过去十年我一直错过了Netflix，因为我无法理解他们为什么能有这么高的估值。我觉得他们不是科技公司，而是媒体公司。是的，他们用算法来推荐你想要的内容，但他们必须购买内容才能放到平台上。所以，为了实现这一切，有很多成本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And Netflix trades at a a multiple that quite frankly, uh, you know, the rest of the media entertainment business cannot believe. And I I I missed Netflix for the past 10 years because I couldn't believe why they trade at this multiple because I was like, they're not a tech company. They're a media company. Like, yes, they use algorithms to help you recommend what content you want, but they're but they have to buy the content to be able to get it on the platform. So, there's a lot of cogs there just in order to make it happen.</p>
</details>

但Netflix的交易市盈率很高，我认为这是因为它是一流的流媒体服务。问题是，他们如何在未来十年保护这个市盈率？我认为要保护它，你需要最好的内容。你必须给每个人一个永不离开的理由，而更多的内容可能就是那个理由。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But Netflix trades at a multiple and I think it's because it's a best-in-class streaming service. Question is, how do they protect that multiple going into the next decade? And I think to protect it, you need the best. But you you have to give everyone a reason to never leave and more content might end up being that reason.</p>
</details>

### 深入Nvidia：与高管对话揭示黄仁勋的极致工作狂人本色

说到英伟达，我昨晚参加的活动就是为Palantir举办的，因为我没能参加市场收盘直播。那是他们的Paragon活动，有点像AIPCON，但规模小一些。这是一个面向客户的活动，客户会来解释他们在做什么。这次的客户比AIPCON少。它也有点像他们在12月举办的年终庆祝派对。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Speaking of Nvidia, last night the event that I was at because I was not on the market close was an event for Pounder. Uh it was their Paragon event. This is kind of like AIPCON but a smaller version of it. It's a customer oriented event where uh the customers come, they explain what they're doing and this one had less customers than AIPcon. It's kind of like all also like an end of year celebration type of party that they do in December.</p>
</details>

Alex Karp先生也在场，他做了一个简短的演讲，然后是一些客户的展示。我去的原因也是为了采访一些客户，我采访到了英伟达合作项目的负责人，以及Palantir与英伟达合作项目的负责人。所以，对于建立英伟达与Palantir合作关系至关重要的两个人，我采访了他们，那个视频下周会发布。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And uh so you had Mr. Alex Karp there and he gave a small speech and then you had some customer presentations. The reason I went as well is to do some interviews with some customers and I got to interview the head of the Nvidia deal along with the head of the Palunteer Nvidia collaboration. So the two people that were integral to setting up the Nvidia Palunteer collaboration um I I got to interview them and that video will come out next week.</p>
</details>

关于我遇到的那位英伟达人士，我有很多话要说。基本上，黄仁勋有30个直接下属。我昨晚见到了其中一位，我们聊了大概30分钟。他和黄仁勋关系非常密切，几乎每天都和黄仁勋交谈。能听他聊聊黄仁勋，以及黄仁勋是如何驾驭这家四万五千亿美元的公司，感觉非常酷。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have a lot to say about the Nvidia person that I met. Basically Jensen has 30 direct reports. I met one of them last night and we talked for like 30 minutes and he's like tight with Jensen like like every single day he's talking to Jensen and it was really cool to pick his brain about Jensen and like just how Jensen is navigating this whole you know four and a half trillion dollar company thing.</p>
</details>

他是个很棒的人，名叫Justin。下周会发布对他的采访视频，这也是我昨天缺席收盘直播的原因。所以我们会详细讨论这些，并深入探讨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So we'll talk more about that but he was an awesome guy. His name was Justin. Interview will be out with him next week and that's why uh that's why I was gone for the market close yesterday. So we'll talk all about that and go deeper into it.</p>
</details>

我昨晚采访了一个叫Justin的人，他是黄仁勋30个直接下属之一。我和他的对话，我觉得非常非常有趣。我们做了采访，我和他还有Kevin一起。Kevin是Palantir商业销售的核心负责人之一，那是一次很棒的采访，大约15分钟，下周会上传。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So, uh, the Nvidia interview that I did last night. So, over the next coming days, I'll be posting that interview. I interviewed a man named Justin, who is one of, uh, Jensen's 30 direct reports. And, uh, the conversation I had with him, I thought was really, really interesting. So, we did the interview. I did it with him and Kevin. Kevin is one of the core uh leads for commercial sales at Palanteer and it was a great interview. It's about 15 minutes and it'll be uploaded next week.</p>
</details>

关于这种合作关系的描述，我还和一位名叫Zach的人聊了聊，他是Palantir公司Sham Sankar手下的一位主要负责人。他来自伦敦办公室，但昨天在纽约。他很详细地描述了这种合作关系。我知道很多人对这种合作关系的具体指标仍然感到困惑，但其核心基本上是，他们都意识到，如果Palantir能为公司提供软件，以更复杂的方式操作**LLM**（Large Language Model：大型语言模型），特别是利用所有的**CUDA**（Compute Unified Device Architecture：统一计算设备架构）库和Nemo模型，也就是所有英伟达的专有软件，那么这就意味着更多的**GPU**（Graphics Processing Unit：图形处理器）和计算需求。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the description of the partnership and I got to talk to someone named Zach who is one of the chief guys underneath Sham Sanker at Palanteer. Um and he he's out of the London office, but he was in New York yesterday and and he kind of was really describing the partnership. I know a lot of people are still kind of confused on sort of the metrics of the partnership, but at its core basically they both realized, hey, if Palunteer is able to provide software to companies that can operationalize the LMS in a more sophisticated way, especially with all the CUDA libraries and the Nemo models, which is all of Nvidia's proprietary software, then that just means more GPU and compute demand</p>
</details>

因为如果你使用的软件有更多的API调用，无论是Entropic、GPT、Gemini还是其他什么，它们最终都要通过某个数据中心里的加速计算机来处理。所以对英伟达来说，这非常有意义。对Palantir来说也很有意义，因为最终你必须使用他们的本体论（ontology）来理解那些大型语言模型。所以这确实是一个“芯片加本体论”的理论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">because if you have the software that's having more API calls, whether it's entropic, GPT, what Gemini, whatever it is, I mean all of those are going through an accelerated computer uh in some data center in some place. So for Nvidia makes a lot of sense and for Palunteer it makes a lot of sense because at the end of the day you're having to use their ontology to be able to make sense of those LLMs. So it really is a chips and ontology type of thesis.</p>
</details>

采访结束后，我们去喝啤酒的时候，才真正有机会深入交谈，玩得很开心。我问他：“所以，黄仁勋到底是个什么样的人？”你知道，这家伙掌管着一个四万五千亿美元的公司，还说他每天读几千封邮件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So after the interview when we went to just get a beer, that's when we like really got to talk and have some fun. And I was like, "So what who what like who is Jensen like?" Like like what is like like you know this guy's running a$ four and a half trillion dollar company and he's talking about he reads thousands of emails every day.</p>
</details>

我看到那个片段时并不太相信。说实话，我喜欢黄仁勋，但我真的不信。我想：“这家伙不可能每天读几千封邮件。”但在和Justin聊过之后，真的很难否认他的工作热情。

<details>
<summary>V/H Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, I saw that clip and I didn't really believe it. I'm not going to lie. Like, I love Jensen, but I I really didn't believe it. I was like, "This guy is not reading several thousand emails every day." And after talking with Justin, it is really hard to deny his work ethic.</p>
</details>

这个叫Justin的家伙在2008年加入英伟达，2014年离开。他2014年离开的原因是，他说他当时正在约会，想和一位女孩确定关系，步入婚姻。但你知道，周日下午他们出去吃早午餐，我却会收到黄仁勋发来的短信，说“今晚之前把幻灯片给我”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So this guy Justin joined Nvidia back in 2005 or sorry 2008. He left in 2014. And the reason he left in 2014 is because he was like I was trying to like I was dating and I was trying to like solidify a girl who I was with and trying to you know turn that into marriage. And you know, we'd be out for a Sunday afternoon brunch and I'd be getting texts from Jensen about I need the slides by tonight.</p>
</details>

他当时面临选择：是选择女孩，还是选择在英伟达的职业生涯？而那时英伟达的股价并没有一飞冲天，那正是英伟达停滞不前、几乎无所作为的十年。所以他在2014年离开了，他告诉黄仁勋，他说：“我只是无法给你所要求的那种工作强度。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And he was, you know, he it's like, do I pick the girl or do I pick this career with Nvidia? And that's when Nvidia stock was not going to the moon. That was like kind of the 10 years where Nvidia was stuck basically doing nothing. And so he left in 2014 and he told Jensen, he was like, I just I just can't give you the the work ethic that you require out of me.</p>
</details>

事实上，这个人不得不离开公司——再次强调，他是黄仁勋的直接下属之一，有30个直接下属，他几乎每天都和黄仁勋交谈。他不得不离开，因为他无法承受，而那是在英伟达股价还没起飞的时候。所以黄仁勋仍然是个工作狂，一心想要征服世界。他要求这个试图在周日和女友结婚的家伙，在他本该休息的时候，完成工作任务。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And the fact that the guy had to leave the company, again, this is one of Jensen's direct reports. He has 30 direct reports. This guy talks to Jensen basically every day. The fact that he had to leave because he could not and that was when Nvidia stock was not going to the moon. So Jensen's still workaholic, you know, trying to take over the world. Um, and he's demanding this guy who's trying to, you know, get this girl to marry him on a Sunday when he's supposed to be off from work. He's, you know, Jensen's asking for for things to get done.</p>
</details>

这个人最终的结论是，我必须离开，因为我无法具备在英伟达担任实际运营者所需的那种工作强度。他在2018年结婚生子后又回来了，黄仁勋张开双臂欢迎他回来，因为他很高兴他能回来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">And the the guy ultimately concluded I had to leave because I could not have the type of work ethic that was required to be an actual operator at Nvidia. He ended up coming back in 2018 after he got married and had some kids and you know he Jensen welcomed him back with open arms because he was he was happy that he came back.</p>
</details>

他给我讲了类似这样的故事，简直令人难以置信，这定义了黄仁勋的工作态度。坦白说，这让我想买更多英伟达的股票。你听过所有关于黄仁勋的故事，但当你真正听到每天和他交谈的人，以及他们如何解读这个人对工作的态度时，这些故事就变得可信了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it was stories like that that he was telling me that was just like pretty incredible to define the guy's work ethic and you know quite frankly it made me want to buy more Nvidia just like you hear all these stories about Jensen but when then you actually hear people that talk to him on a daily basis and how they're uh interpreting this guy's attitude towards the work it becomes credible.</p>

### PCE数据发布：符合预期的通胀报告点燃市场热情

PCE数据将于上午10点公布。我看到的预期是……我们还会得到密歇根大学消费者信心指数……预期是2%。所以，如果数据能达到或低于2.8%，或者就在2.8%，这个周五可能会很有趣。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, PCE is coming out at uh 10:00 a.m. The expectation for it from what I'm seeing, let's pull this up right here, is oh, we also get Michigan consumer sentiment is um 2%. So, if we can come in and then uh year-over-year it's 2.8%. If we can come in below 2.8 or at 2.8, this could be a fun Friday.</p>
</details>

数据出来了，2.8%对2.8%的预期。PCE数据完全符合预期，这是一个非常好的结果。月度数据是0.3%对0.3%的预期。个人支出是0.3%对0.3%的预期。个人收入是0.4%对0.3%的预期，这是一个超预期的好数据。消费者信心指数是53.3对52的预期，也是一个超预期的好数据。然后是月度价格指数，0.2%对0.2%的预期。这次数据没有一项不及预期。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The data is 2.8 versus 2.8 expected. 2.8 versus 2.8 expected. That's a really good inline number on PCE. Month overmonth, it was.3 versus.3 expected. Personal spending.3 versus.3 expected. Personal income 04 versus.3 expected. That's a beat to the upside, which is good. Consumer sentiment 53.3 versus 52 expected. That's a beat, which is good. And then price index month over month 2 versus2 expected. We don't have a single miss on this.</p>
</details>

标普指数出现了一个非常轻微的绿色蜡烛图，现在又回到了正常水平。英伟达有了一点点反弹，但没什么太大的动静。但几乎所有的数据都符合预期。我的意思是，PCE如果达到3%或3.1%会很难看。它能达到2.8%是件好事，也许这会成为未来几个月和11月的趋势。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We don't have a single miss on this. S&P had a very slight green candle and now it's back to normal. Nvidia little little bit of a bounce. Nothing too crazy, but almost every number here uh in line. I mean, you know, PCE if that came in at like three or 3.1 that would have been ugly. The fact that it came in at 2.8 is nice to see and maybe that could be the trend for the coming for the coming months in and November.</p>

### 监管风云：白宫对Netflix收购案持“高度怀疑”态度

哦，CNBC头条新闻。据报道，特朗普政府对Netflix以720亿美元收购华纳兄弟的提议持“高度怀疑”态度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh oh. CNBC headline. The Trump administration reportedly views their proposed $72 billion deal for Netflix to acquire Warner Brothers with heavy skepticism.</p>
</details>

你知道，从技术上讲，这可能是Netflix现在上涨的原因，因为投资者可能不喜欢Netflix想支付800亿美元，如果……但等等，不不不。根据协议，他们必须支付60亿美元的分手费。所以我不知道这是否是利好。60亿比800亿好，但如果交易最终不能获批，白白损失60亿对Netflix来说也不是好事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You know, technically that could be why Netflix is going up right now because investors might not like that Netflix wants to pay 80 billion and if the But hold on. No, no, no. That's not be as for the agreement, they have to pay six billion in a breakup fee. So, I don't I don't know if it's bullish. Six billion is better than 80 billion, but still six billion for nothing if this doesn't get approved is not bullish for Netflix.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为他们有动力去完成这笔交易。标普指数687，663。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, I I think they are incentivized to get this deal done. S&P 687 663.</p>
</details>

我们现在从政府那里得到了一些消息，这是我们的第一反应。我刚刚与一位高级政府官员取得了联系，他告诉我，政府对这笔交易的看法可以被描述为“高度怀疑”。所以，总统还没有表态，我们会关注Truth Social。但这位高级政府官员刚刚对我说的这句话，表明他们对这笔交易持高度怀疑态度。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, Carl, we're getting some news here. Our first reaction now from the administration. I was just in contact moments ago with a senior administration official who tells me that the administration's view of this deal can be characterized as heavy skepticism. So, uh, no word from the president yet. We'll watch Truth Social. But that word from a senior official, senior administration official to me just moments ago saying they view this deal with heavy skepticism.</p>
</details>

我认为这正是我们对这笔交易的预期。你知道，白宫对Netflix的普遍看法是，它有点像一个“奥巴马实体”，因为他们与奥巴马家族达成了那笔交易。他们希望埃里森家族能参与进来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think that's what we could have expected uh from this deal. You know, the general view at the White House of uh Netflix is, you know, sort of it's an Obama uh entity because of that deal that they did with the Obama family. They wanted the Ellison to</p>
</details>

当你说到“高度怀疑”时，我想政府肯定没有忘记Netflix的联合创始人里德·哈斯廷斯一直非常反特朗普。他在这方面投入了大量资金。最近，他支持了州长库默在重新划分众议院选区地图的行动中，以及在“阻止特朗普”运动中。这肯定会起作用，即使它本不应该起作用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Aean, when you were saying the heavy skepticism, I mean, I'm sure it's not lost on the administration that the co-founder of Netflix, Reed Hastings, has been very anti-Trump. Um, has put a a lot of money where his mouth is. most recently backed Governor Nuomo in the redistricting to redraw the House map and in the in the sort of stop Trump movement. That has to play a role even if it's not supposed to.</p>
</details>

是的，你刚刚听到财政部长Bessant在Dealbook会议上与我们的Andrew Ross Sorkin同台时，提到了Netflix与奥巴马夫妇的交易，以此来嘲讽某些网络的政治化，对吧？所以，Netflix在这届政府内部并不受待见。正如你所说，我现在被一位高级政府官员告知，我们得到的初步反应是“高度怀疑”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. And you just heard Treasury Secretary Bessant, you know, on stage with our Andrew Ross Sorcin at the Dealbook Conference invoked, uh, the Netflix deal with the Obamas on stage to sort of mock the sort of politicization of some of these networks, right? So, uh, Netflix is not favorably viewed within this administration. And as as you say, I'm now being told by a senior administration official, the first blush reaction that we are getting is heavy skepticism.</p>
</details>

那么，这会如何体现出来呢？我认为会体现在司法部的反垄断程序中。但我想，如果特朗普总统想在这里施加影响——他经常这样做——他可以动用一系列其他的行政权力，以一种我们在正常政府中通常不会看到的方式来施加影响，这里“正常”这个词要打上引号。这位总统在解释行政权力方面是个“极简主义者”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, how does that materialize? I think in the Department of Justice antirust process, but I think if President Trump, you know, wants to flex here, and he often does, uh, there are a whole host of other elements of executive power that he could bring to bear, uh, in a way that we just typically wouldn't see in a normal administration to put quote marks around the word normal there. Uh, this president, you know, is a maximalist in terms of his interpretation of executive power.</p>
</details>

你看，如果交易不成，Netflix就要损失60亿美元。所以我不知道特朗普政府会怎么做。这可能需要一段时间才能有结果。Netflix今天股价翻绿，报103美元。但如果交易失败，60亿美元就打了水漂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Look, if it doesn't happen, Netflix is out of $6 billion. So, I don't know what the Trump administration is going to do here. It's probably going to take a while to figure out. Netflix green on the day right now 103. But if the deal doesn't go through six billion down the toilet.</p>
</details>

所以我猜我们得等等看。我认为这需要一段时间。所以对于那些仅仅因为这笔交易而买入Netflix的人来说，我认为短期内不会有任何结果。股价可能会跌破100美元，也可能涨到110美元。它可能会陷入这种僵局。如果说有什么影响的话，这可能会在未来一年给该股带来不确定性。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I guess we're going to see. I I think this is going to take a while though. So for those that are kind of getting into Netflix just for this, I don't think there's any resolution. This thing could go back down below 100. It could go up to 110. Could be stuck in this. Like if anything, if anything, it might end up creating an overhang for the stock for the next year.</p>
</details>

这是另一个需要考虑的角度，因为如果这笔交易的叙事始终围绕着“他们是否会收购”展开，而且这不像是什么小打小闹的收购，这会改变公司的整个发展轨迹。所以，如果这是Netflix在2026年必须一直处理的叙事，那就值得思考了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That's another perspective to think about because if this is constantly over the narrative of the stock is like will they acquire and this is not just like some rinky dinky little acquisition. This is like changes the entire trajectory of the company. So it is something to think about if this is a 2026 narrative that Netflix has to deal with the whole time.</p>
</details>

不过我还是觉得这笔交易会通过。你真的认为特朗普会因为觉得Netflix和奥巴马关系好，或者里德·哈斯廷斯喜欢加文·纽森就取消它吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I kind of still think the deal goes through though. Do you really do you really think Trump is going to cancel it cuz he he thinks Netflix is tight with the Obamas and that Reed Hastings likes Gavin Newsome?</p>
</details>
