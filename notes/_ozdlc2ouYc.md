### 太空探索的新浪潮

**主持人**: 感觉现在是谈论太空的激动人心的时刻，而且每个人似乎都在这样做。我想我们也许可以就此开始。从你的角度来看，你认为是什么推动了这股太空探索的兴奋和投资新浪潮？你觉得此刻有什么不同？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It feels like this is just an exciting time to talk about space and, uh, and everyone seems to be doing it. I think maybe we could just kick things off and start right there. From your perspective, what do you think is driving this new wave of excitement and investment in space exploration? What, what feels different to you about this moment?

</details>

**Chris Hadfield**: 准入。惠特尼，历史上有一些令人惊叹的时刻，我们作为一个物种，集体发明了一些新事物，为人类开启了全新的机遇。想想看，当我们第一次驯服火，或者当有人建造了第一艘木筏横渡，我不知道，红海。或者当我们开始驯养马匹，让我们能够快速旅行。或者当第一辆火车在18世纪末19世纪初被发明，然后是飞机和汽车。所有这些事情不仅改变了我们移动的方式，也改变了我们能去的地方。太空飞行已经存在了60年，但我们现在正处于一场**可重复使用飞船设计**的革命中，这极大地降低了成本，从而增加了所有人的准入。现在，只要花一辆豪华车的价格，就可以买一张票去太空。豪华车很贵，但也有很多人在买豪华车。所以，这只是一个革命性的时代，在所有正在进行的科学和探索活动中，我们开始离开地球。我发现这一切都非常鼓舞人心，令人兴奋，也基于我一生所做的事情，感到非常愉快。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Hadfield**: Uh, access. There are amazing times in history, Whitney, where we collectively as a species invent something new that opens up whole new opportunities for humanity. Uh, think about, you know, when we first harnessed fire or when someone built the first raft to cross, I don't know, the Red Sea. Uh, or when we started, um, domesticating horses and and allowed ourselves to travel quickly. Uh, or when the first train was invented, you know, late 1700s, early 1800s, and then the airplane and the car. All of those things, uh, changed not only how we could move around, but then where we could go to. And spaceflight has been around now for 60 years, but we're in a revolution right now of **reusable spaceship design**, which is drastically dropping the cost, which then increases the access for everybody. And right now, it's it's possible to just buy a ticket and go to space for the price of a luxury car. And luxury cars are expensive, but there are a lot of people buying luxury cars, too. So it's it's just a a kind of a revolutionary time in starting to leave Earth in amongst all the scientific and explorative stuff going on. And, uh, I I find it all really inspiring and exciting and also kind of delightful based on what I've done my whole life.

</details>

**主持人**: 你经历了太空探索的许多时代，从冷战竞争到国际合作，再到我们现在看到的私人企业激增。你认为太空的目的在这些阶段中是如何演变的？人们是如何以不同方式思考它的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And I mean, and you've lived through many eras of of space exploration from you know, think about like cold war competition to international cooperation and now where we are where we're seeing this sort of surge in private enterprise and and how do you how do you think the the purpose of going to space has evolved through these phases? How have people thought thought about it differently?

</details>

**Chris Hadfield**: 我出生的时候，我绝不是世界上最老的人，但那时还没有人去过太空。当我刚学走路的时候，**尤里·加加林**（Yuri Gagarin）和一个月后的**艾伦·谢泼德**（Al Shepard），以及所有后来的人才开始进入太空。所以，这在人类经验中仍然是极其新鲜的事物。我认为这种演变是完全合理的，最初它几乎不可能实现，我们冒着巨大的风险去尝试。就像我们经常对待新能力一样，比如第一批去南极洲的人。他们中很大一部分人死在了尝试证明的路上，**沙克尔顿**（Shackleton）勉强保住了他的全体船员的性命，但这只是为了真正拓展人类经验的极限。那是我成长时期的状况。然后我们从**阿波罗计划**（Apollo program），包括**阿波罗13号**（Apollo 13）和所有那些险些发生的事故，演变到**航天飞机计划**（shuttle program），我们使其常态化了很多，但我们仍然在航天飞机期间发生了两起悲惨的、完全致命的事故。但我们在这方面做得越来越好。我们从过去每一个问题中学到了很多。所以现在，定期将人们送往空间站并返回的飞船，**SpaceX** 的 **龙飞船**（Dragon）及其顶部的**龙飞船舱**（Dragon capsule），是迄今为止最安全的火箭。这并非偶然，而是一个自然的发展过程。一旦你让某样东西足够安全和便宜，它就不再仅仅是像**苏联**或**美国**这样的万亿富翁的专属领域，它会下沉到亿万富翁，然后是百万富翁，再往下，我不知道你称之为“十万富翁”还是什么，就是拥有10万美元或7.5万美元的人。它仍然很昂贵，但如果你把它画在曲线上，很容易推断出它的发展方向。这自然会开启更多的商业机会，用于将物品送入太空，用于商业目的的卫星观测世界，也仅仅是为了人们不再只是冒着生命危险去探索，而是去体验一次太空之旅。现在很多人都在这样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Hadfield**: When I was born, uh, and I'm by no means the oldest man in the world, no one had gone to space. Like I, when I was just learning to walk, that's when **Yuri Gagarin** and then a month later **Al Shepard** and then everybody that followed started going to space. So it's it's still incredibly new in in the human experience. Um, and I I think the evolution, uh, makes complete sense where initially it was just barely possible and we we took an enormous risk to try and just like we often do with a new capability like the first people to Antarctica. A large percentage of them died just trying to prove whether **Shackleton** managed to keep his whole crew alive barely, but, uh, just trying to push really the envelope of human experience. And that's where we were when I was growing up. And then we evolved from, uh, the **Apollo program** with **Apollo 13** and and all those near misses to the **shuttle program** which we regularized it a lot, but it's still we had two tragic, uh, completely fatal accidents during shuttle and and but we've gotten better and better at it. We've learned so much from each of those problems in the past. So that now the vehicle that regularly takes people to the space station and back, the **SpaceX** **Dragon** vehicle with a with a **Dragon capsule** on top, it's it's the safest rocket ever. And that didn't happen accidentally. It is a natural progression. And as soon as you make something safe enough and cheap enough, then it stops being just the purview of, uh, of a trillionaire like the **Soviet Union** or the **United States** and it gets down to the billionaire and then the millionaire and then I I don't know what you call under that the centinire or something someone who has I don't know $100,000 or $75,000. Um, it's still expensive, but but if you plot it on a curve, you it's easy to extrapolate where it's going. And that naturally then opens up a lot more commercial opportunity for, uh, putting things in space, for satellites to observe the world for commercial purposes, but also just for people not just to risk their lives and explore, but to just see what it's like to go for a ride. And lots of people are doing that now.

</details>

**主持人**: 哇。听起来你认为我们可能会看到更多这样的情况，或者随着时间的推移，它会变得更加普及。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Wow. Uh, and it sounds like you you think that we're probably going to see more of this or it will become even more accessible as as time goes on.

</details>

**Chris Hadfield**: 如果你在1920年问我关于飞机同样的问题，那是在第一次世界大战之后，政府进行了大量的开发，然后第一批航空公司开始成立。最早的航空公司之一是荷兰的**KM**。我的意思是，那简直是疯狂的。没有规章制度，仪表飞行还没有出现。你在哪里加油？没有大型的跑道基础设施。但人们看到了，嘿，这很重要。这将为我们打开整个世界，让我们走在最前沿，让我们行动起来。你无法阻止人们的创造力、想象力和创业精神。这正是我们现在太空飞行中非常顺利地进入的阶段。我帮助运营一个大型国际技术孵化器，名为**创意破坏实验室**（Creative Destruction Lab）。我负责其中的太空部分。所以我经常看到来自世界各地的数百名才华横溢的年轻人，他们正在建立企业，开发想法，以便利用历史上的这个时刻，成为我们未来所需技术的最早开发者之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Hadfield**: Well, if you'd asked me the same question about airplanes in, uh, 1920, say, uh, after we'd had a big area of, uh, of government development with the first world war and then the very first airlines started being formed. One of the first was **KM** in Holland and they I mean, it was crazy. There were no regulations. Uh, instrument flying didn't exist yet. Where do you get fuel there? They don't there's not any big infrastructure of runways, but people saw that, hey, this is important. This is going to open up the whole world to us and let's be on the cutting edge of it and let's let's move out. You can't stop people's creativity and imagination and entrepreneurship. And that's the phase we're just really nicely entering into in space flight right now. I I help run a big international technology incubator called the **Creative Destruction Lab**. I run the space component of that. And so I regularly see hundreds of brilliant young people from all around the world, uh, building businesses, uh, developing ideas so that they can take advantage of of this moment in history to be some of the early, uh, developers of the technologies we're going to need.

</details>

### 太空探索中的地缘政治与合作

**主持人**: 很多人在看新闻头条时，不仅是关于太空的，还有普遍的全球紧张局势和地缘政治紧张局势。太空在很多方面一直反映着当时的政治。所以我想知道，当你看到这些头条新闻和正在发生的事情时，你认为在轨道上合作有什么机会？以及在这个时刻，当我们思考太空探索的未来时，你认为存在哪些风险？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You know, I think another thing a lot of folks when they they're looking at the headlines, not just related to space, but just in general, um, there's, you know, a lot of things happening around, you know, global tensions and geopolit political, um, tensions and space has always in a lot of ways reflected the the politics of the time. And so I I wonder if when you look at at these headlines and and see the things that are are going on out there, what opportunities you might see for collaboration in orbit and potentially what what risks, um, do you think were presented in this moment when we think about the future of space exploration?

</details>

**Chris Hadfield**: 是的，所有新发明都是**双重用途**的。我们很少思考这一点，但你提出的任何新想法，都可以和平使用，也可以对抗性使用。冶金，比如刀叉，或者任何东西，火，或者核能，天哪，所有的一切。我们只是人类。我认识了**珍·古道尔**（Jane Goodall），我们一起做了很多事情，她最近不幸去世了，但今年三月我还在和她在一起，我们当时在谈论她最初乐观地进入丛林，关于动物的纯真和纯洁时发现的一件事。她发现黑猩猩会互相残杀，它们会发动战争。黑猩猩部落之间会发动战争，它们会进行种族灭绝。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Hadfield**: Yeah, all new inventions are **dual use**. You know, we we we don't really think about it much, but everything you ever come up with, any new idea, it can be used peacefully. It can be used antagonistically, you know, metallurgy, uh, with knives and forks or or anything, fire or nuclear energy or gosh, everything. And and we're just people. I got to know, um, **Jane Goodall**, uh, had multiple things we did together and she just sadly passed away recently, but I was with her back in March and we were talking one of the things she discovered when she went into the jungles quite optimistically about, you know, the innocence and the purity of animals. She discovered that chimpanzees murder each other and they they wage war. Tribes of chimpanzees wage war on each other. They commit genocide.

</details>

**Chris Hadfield**: 我的意思是，那是地球上所有生物中与我们最接近的动物。我们也是一个有缺陷的生物。但同时，我们也发展了社会、社会规则和文化，保护我们免受最坏本性的影响。我们有警察部队和军队。所以所有这些都将被输出到太空。现在，由于准入有限，它可能比本来可以的稍微纯粹一些。但你需要记住，1962年，**美国**和**苏联**都在地球轨道上引爆了核武器，并造成了可怕的后果。几乎全世界都能看到极光，因为磁场受到了巨大干扰，它摧毁了一大批卫星，夏威夷的一些地面站也因为来自天空的巨大能量而起火。所以，我们绝非完美。我们需要做的是，像对待过去所有新技术一样，审视这项新技术，并思考我们应该如何监管它？我们如何整合它，使其真正服务于人类的状况？我关注很多不同的事情，但这正是其中之一。我如何能成为那些长远思考、大局思考的人群中的一员？我是**开放月球基金会**（Open Lunar Foundation）的主席，负责月球定居政策，以及如何不重蹈地球上现有问题的覆辙。但如果我们等待一切都完美，我们将永远一事无成。我们必须在允许人类行为不完美的同时，以某种方式做那些令人惊叹的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Hadfield**: I mean, and and that's the closest animal in the entire, uh, living things on earth that we're related to. We are very much that a flawed being. But at the same time, we have developed society and and societal rules and cultures that protect us from our worst nature. And we have police forces and and military forces. And so all of that is going to be exported into space. Right now it's been, uh, maybe slightly more pure than it could have been because of the limited access to it. But you need to remember in 1962 both the **United States** and the **Soviet Union** detonated nuclear weapons in Earth orbit and had horrific, uh, consequences. Like almost the whole world could see aurora because of the big disruption of the magnetic field and it wiped out a whole bunch of satellites and, uh, some of the ground stations in Hawaii caught fire because of all the tremendous amount of energy coming from the sky. So, you know, we're we're by no means perfect. What we need to do is, uh, look at this new technology just like we have all the ones in the past and figure out how should we regulate it? How do we integrate it so that it actually serves a purpose for the human condition? And I I I focus on a lot of different things, but that is very much one of them. How can I be part of the group of people that is thinking long term, thinking big picture? Uh, I'm the chair of the **Open Lunar Foundation** looking at lunar settlement policy and and how not to just mirror the problems that exist on Earth right now. But if if we wait for everything to be perfect, we we'll never do anything and we have to somehow do the amazing things while allowing for the, uh, the imperfections of human behavior.

</details>

### 太空技术与地球挑战

**主持人**: 你不会惊讶地知道，我们收到了很多来自观众的有趣问题，他们对你的工作和你现在所说的一切都非常着迷。我想，为了承接你所说的，你是否看到太空探索与我们地球上正在面临的一些挑战之间存在某种模糊的界限，无论是地缘政治还是气候变化？我们有一个来自**Cat H**的问题，她问我们如何才能像气候活动家一样思考对太空的投资。这如何能成为我们看待太空旅行方式的一部分？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You will not be surprised to know that we're getting lots of, uh, interesting questions from the audience who are just so fascinated by your work and and the things that you're saying right now. And, you know, I think to sort of piggyback on on what you're saying, um, you know, do you see this, I guess, this sort of blurring line between space exploration and some of the challenges that we're facing here at home, whether that is, you know, geopolitics or or climate change, for instance. We have a a question from, um, from **Cat H**, who asks how we might think about investing in space as as climate activists. How how how can that be part of the way we look at space travel?

</details>

**Chris Hadfield**: 是的。这很像你如何成为一名气候活动家并投资其他行业。当然，太空产业都不是基于太空的。所有的产业和投资都发生在地球上。所以，如果你看一家公司，比如**GHG Sat**，**GHG** 代表温室气体。他们开发了一种非常巧妙的小型传感器，专门寻找像甲烷这样对我们大气化学变化贡献最大的气体，从而导致全球变暖的温室效应。**GHG Sat** 是一家非常成功的公司，他们正在引领世界。他们所做的是，他们环绕地球轨道，24/7不间断地寻找大型甲烷泄漏的未知来源，然后通知拥有管道或工厂或任何设施的人。还有像**Planet**这样的公司，他们拥有数百颗卫星，每天以非常高的分辨率对地球进行成像，他们做了很多你可以称之为利他主义的工作，试图让每个人都能看到我们星球的实际健康状况和正在发生的事情。所以，这是一个足够大的产业，一个价值数十亿美元的产业，其中有很多不同的领域，你可以通过投资某些公司来选择支持。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Hadfield**: Right. Well, it's it's much like how can you be a climate activist and invest in some other industry. Of course, none of the space industries are based in space. All of the industry and investing happens here on Earth. And so, if you look at a company, for example, like, uh, **GHG Sat**, uh, **GHG** stands for greenhouse gas. And what they developed is a really clever little sensor that specifically looks for the gases like methane that contribute most, um, to, uh, changes in the chemistry of our atmosphere and therefore, um, the greenhouse effect that leads to global warming. And **GHG Sat** is is a very successful company and and they're leading the world. And what they do is they they, uh, orbit the world and constantly 24/7 look for unknown sources of big methane leaks and then inform the person that that owns the pipeline or the plant or whatever. There's a company like **Planet**, um, that that has hundreds of satellites up that are imaging the world down to very fine resolution every day and they do a lot of what you would have to call altruistic work to try and let everybody see the actual health of our planet and what's going on. And so, uh, it's a big enough industry, multi multi-billion dollar industry, that there's lots of different areas in it that that you can choose to support by, um, by investing in certain companies.

</details>

### 推动太空长期居住的关键创新

**主持人**: 我很想就此再深入一点。当你想到技术，以及所有领域都在进步，尤其是在太空领域，我们现在有了可重复使用的火箭，人工智能被用来辅助航天器，甚至还有自主漫游器等等。你当然比我更精通这些，但...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I'd love to to build on that a little bit. You know, when you think about the technology, um, and you know, what's advancing in in all spaces, but in in in space, uh, you know, we have what reusable rockets now and AI being used to, um, assist spacecraft and you know, even autonomous rovers and and that sort of thing. And and you of course are way more versed in this than than I am, but

</details>

**Chris Hadfield**: 我自己就是一台半自主漫游器。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Hadfield**: I'm a semi-autonomous rover myself.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。我的意思是，我想当你思考所有这些事物时，你认为哪些创新正在最大程度地重塑我们最终能够在地球之外度过大量时间的方式？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. Well, I mean, I like I guess when you when you think about all this stuff, what what are the innovations that you see that you think are most reshaping our path to eventually being able to spend significant amounts of time off of Earth?

</details>

**Chris Hadfield**: 是的。惠特尼，你提到的第一个就是**可重复使用的火箭**。现在，我们拥有部分可重复使用的火箭。第一级火箭将你送离发射台并升入空中，这样你就可以达到足够快的速度。你知道，为了保持轨道，你必须每秒飞行5英里，即每秒8公里。你在地球大气层中无法做到这一点，摩擦力太大了。但一旦你升到大气层之上，你就可以横向飞行并加速到轨道速度。所以，第一级火箭负责重型升空，将你送离发射台，送入几乎没有空气的地方，然后它燃料耗尽并分离。现在，正如在座大多数人所知，这些第一级火箭会返回并着陆。所以你不会扔掉任何金属，你实际上只是在支付燃料费用。这极大地降低了进入太空的成本。不仅是**SpaceX**及其**龙飞船**或**猎鹰火箭**（Falcon rocket）广为人知，**蓝色起源**（Blue Origin）也已经发射了一次，他们将在几周内再次发射他们的大型运载火箭，他们以早期宇航员的名字将其命名为**新格伦**（New Glenn）。他们正试图将第一级火箭降落在驳船上。然后，一家新西兰公司，一个非常强大的后起之秀，名为**火箭实验室**（Rocket Lab），他们有一款新的部分可重复使用火箭，名为**中子**（Neutron），他们计划在今年年底前从美国东海岸发射。所以，多家西方公司正在与第一级可重复使用火箭竞争，而中国也在做同样的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Hadfield**: Yeah. One of the first ones you touched on, Whitney, which is **reusable rockets**. Right now, we have partially reusable rockets. Uh, the first stage that gets you off the launch pad and above the air so that then you can go fast enough. You know, in order to stay in orbit, you have to go 5 miles a second, 8 km a second. You can't do that down here in the air. There's just too much friction. But as soon as you get above the air, then you can go sideways and accelerate out to orbital speed. And so that first stage that does the heavy lifting, gets you off the pad, gets you up, uh, you know, where there's virtually no air, and then it runs out of fuel and spits you off. Now, those first stages, as as most people on this call know, come back and land. So you don't you don't throw away any of the metal and you really are just paying for fuel. And that has radically dropped the cost of access to space. And not only is it **SpaceX** with their **Dragon** or their **Falcon rocket** that a lot of people know about, um, but, uh, **Blue Origin** is has already launched once, but they're launching again within a few weeks their big lifter that they named after one of the early astronauts. They call it **New Glenn**. And they're trying to land that first stage out on a barge. And then a New Zealand company, a real strong upandcomer called **Rocket Lab**, has a new partially reusable rocket called **Neutron** that they're intending to launch from the east coast to the US before the end of the year. So multiple Western companies competing with first stage reusable rockets and in China they're doing the same thing.

</details>

**Chris Hadfield**: 真正的改变将是当我们拥有**100%可重复使用的火箭**时。这样你每次飞行都不会扔掉任何建造和沉没成本投资。你可以像客机一样把部件带回来，加满燃料，然后再次使用。那样你就会真正实现财务可行。它不需要一个庞大的组织就能进入太空。而这正随着**SpaceX**的新**星舰**（Starship）迅速到来。它是一个巨大的火箭，也是一个非常复杂的任务。但如果你看了他们上次的第11次试飞，他们取得了显著的成功。两个部件都安全返回了。他们正在突破极限，试图找出如何在复杂性中实现所有经济节约。但很快你就会看到星舰从德克萨斯州或佛罗里达州发射，第一级火箭返回并被捕获，然后轨道级火箭升空，在太空中完成任务，然后返回并被捕获，堆叠起来，加满燃料，再次使用。这正在相当迅速地到来，这将进一步降低成本。所以对我来说，**准入**就是一切。一旦我们能让东西安全、简单、尽可能便宜地进入太空，地球轨道和地月经济就会真正腾飞。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Hadfield**: Um, what the real change will be when we have a **100% reusable rocket**. So you don't throw away any of your, um, construction and and in sunk cost investment with each flight. You can just bring the pieces back like an airliner, fill them up with fuel and use them again. And then you become really, uh, financially viable. Uh, it it doesn't take an enormous organization just to get to space. And and that's coming quickly with **SpaceX**'s new **Starship**. It's a monster of a rocket and a very complex thing to do. But if you watch their last flight, their 11th test flight, they had remarkable success. Both pieces safely made it back. They're pushing the edges of the envelope to try and figure out, you know, where they can make all of their, uh, economical savings in in complexity. But it won't be very long before you see a **Starship** launch either from Texas or Florida. Um, the first stage come back and get grabbed and then the orbital stage get up do what it's doing in space and then come back and get grabbed stack them up fill them up with fuel and use them again that's coming quite rapidly that's going to drop the cost even more and so to me access is everything, uh, as soon as we can make it safe and simple and as inexpensive as possible for things to get to space that's when the earth orbit and earth moon economies will really take off.

</details>

### 人类文明的挑战与太空视角

**主持人**: 你谈到了一些可能需要发生的技术进步，才能使我们成为一个太空物种。我想，当你想到我们可能面临的其他障碍时，无论是政治还是伦理方面，你认为阻碍我们实现这一目标的最大障碍是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Well, you've you've talked a little bit about some of the the technological things that might need to happen in order to enable us to to be a a space fairing species, um, species, excuse me. Um, I guess when you think about some of the other obstacles that we might face, whether that's political or ethical things, what do you see as some of the the biggest things standing in our way from seeing this as a reality?

</details>

**Chris Hadfield**: 嗯，文明总是兴衰更迭。有些文明持续了很长时间，比如**罗马帝国**。如果你看看中国，他们在人类历史上是一个异类。尽管他们有起有落，但他们作为独立的**地缘政治**实体已经存在了几千年。这给正在发生的事情带来了一种紧迫感，因为你不需要追溯太远的历史，无论是中世纪、黑暗时代，还是埃及文明的鼎盛时期，然后崩溃，或者所有更早的文明。所以，如果你不认为我们当前的文明不会分崩离析，然后崩溃一段时间，直到新的事物出现，那你就是在自欺欺人。所以，现在发生的事情具有紧迫性。我们正处于一个能够做宏伟事情的时刻。你知道，思考现在地球上同时发生的、处于尖端的大量事情，五年前还不可能的事情，这令人震惊。所以，我所做的大部分工作都是努力帮助维持这一切，阻止我们陷入我们糟糕的**黑猩猩本性**，并真正充分利用我们所继承的文明。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Hadfield**: Well, civilizations rise and fall. Uh, all the time. Some of them last a long time. The **Roman Empire**. Uh, if you look at China, they've been an anomaly in human history. Although they've had, you know, all of their es and flows, they've been kind of a discrete **geopolitical** unit for thousands and thousands of years in that part of the world. Uh, and that adds a sense of urgency to what's going on because you don't have to look very far back in history to whatever the Middle Ages, the dark ages or, you know, Egypt had that zenith of civilization and then and then collapsed or all the ones that came before that. And so, you're just sticking your head in the sand if if you don't think that our current civilization is going to come apart at the seams. And and crumble for a while before something else emerges. So, so there's urgency to what's happening. We're at a moment right now where we're capable of doing magnificent things. You know, uh, it's it's kind of staggering to think of the huge number of things that are happening simultaneously on Earth right now, right at the cutting edge, stuff that was impossible just five years ago. Um, and so a lot of what I do is to be part of the effort to help hold it all together, to keep us from falling to our our bad **chimpanzeee natures** and to actually, um, make the most of of the civilization that we've been handed.

</details>

**Chris Hadfield**: 但是，惠特尼，你在环绕世界轨道时真正内化的一件事是**时间感**。在一个喧嚣的城市里，一切都快速运转，你很难想象世界的其他地方。当然也很难想象一百年，几乎不可能想象一千年或一万年。但在飞船安静、充满恩典、几乎神圣的环境中，你只需透过窗户就能看到各大洲是如何拼接在一起的。当我在飞船上时，我们在六个月内从太阳的一侧飞到另一侧。我得以观察整个世界从夏季到冬季的变化，因为半球交换了。我得以观察整个世界在一次呼吸中，我意识到这是我们世界刷新自身的45亿次呼吸之一。那种**时间感**真正渗透到我心中，也渗透到人类经验的**共通性**中，因为无论我们选择住在哪里，你都会看到相同的模式。它们都是相似的，无论你是在康涅狄格州上空，还是在非洲上空，还是在澳大利亚上空。你会看到，嘿，那里的人们只是在做同样的事情。他们都想要一点快乐和欢笑，以及一个美好的世界给他们的孩子和孙子孙女。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Hadfield**: But I also, one of the things, Whitney, that you really internalize orbiting the world is, um, a **sense of time**. M in a in a frenetic place in a city you just everything's just going going going and fast and it's hard to even imagine the rest of the world. It sure is hard to imagine a hundred years and it's virtually impossible to imagine a thousand years or 10,000 years. But on the quiet gracefilled almost sanctity of a spaceship you can see where the continents fit together just by looking out the window. And and while I was on board the spaceship, we went from one side of the sun to the other over 6 months. And I got to watch the entire world, um, change from summer to winter as the hemisphere swapped. I got to watch the whole world take a breath in what I realized was one of four and a half billion breaths of how our world refreshes itself. And that that **sense of time** really soaked into me and it and also the **commonality** of the human experience because you see the same patterns reflected no matter where we have chosen to live. Uh, they they all are similar whether you're over Connecticut or whether you're over Africa or whether you're over Australia. You can see, hey, it's just people doing the same thing down there. And they all want a little joy and laughter and a good world for their children and their grandchildren.

</details>

**Chris Hadfield**: 所以对我来说，这缓和了许多新闻报道中那种恐慌的紧迫感，以及渗透到日常社会中的那种绝望的狂躁情绪。这让我成为一个**永远的乐观主义者**，因为我们这个物种已经在这里存在了50万年，尽管我们有破坏性，尽管有兴衰，我们仍然在这里。我只是觉得，作为当前这一代成年人，我们有必要不浪费这一切，尽力认识我们的历史，充分利用我们的现在，这样我们才能给我们的孩子一个体面的未来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Hadfield**: And so to me, that tempers the kind of panicked urgency of a lot of news reporting and and frantic feeling of desperation that that seeps into common everyday society. It it great makes me an **eternal optimist** because our species has been here for half a million years and we're still here despite our destructive nature and despite the rises and falls. And I just see it as a necessity as the current crop of adults to not squander that and and to try and do our best to recognize our history and make the most of our present so we can hand our kids a decent future.

### 太空探索：人类的共同项目

**主持人**: 从那个有利位置看生活，这是一种非凡的视角，我想很多人可以借鉴它，帮助他们应对日常生活，并让他们扎根于真正重要的事情。嗯，我的意思是，我认为，谈到我们之前提到的一些全球分裂问题，太空探索在很多方面都像一个超越国界、超越任何可能分裂我们的事物的人类项目。你认为在这个时刻，它是否仍然有机会以同样的方式将人们团结在一起，就像过去一样？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It's an extraordinary, uh, perspective on on life from being able to see it from that v vantage point and it seems like something that I imagine a lot of people could take and help them sort of navigate their day-to-day and ground them, uh, in what really matters. Um, well, you know, I I mean, I think that, uh, speaking into this this point of like thinking about global division, which we talked about a little earlier, um, and how in a lot of ways space exploration has served as somewhat of like a human, uh, project that transcends, you know, borders, uh, transcends any any sort of thing that might divide us. Um, do you think that there's an opportunity for it to still bring people together, um, in that same way in in this moment as it as in the past?

</details>

**Chris Hadfield**: 是的，事实上，也许现在比以往任何时候都更重要。如果你看看自1990年代初以来的世界历史，随着**苏联**解体、**铁幕**和**柏林墙**倒塌，我们经历了一个奇怪的30年和平泡沫。这不是我们正常的行为。我们更正常的历史行为是冲突、恐惧和对财产的嫉妒，这些往往会煽动人类最糟糕的行为。但即使自90年代初以来，也发生了很多不好的事情。**海湾战争**，当然还有地中海另一端和乌克兰正在发生的大规模人类冲突和生命损失。当发生冲突，民族主义情绪高涨，以及90年代初开始的乐观国际主义减弱时，我认为在这种情况下，你需要更多好的榜样，人们可以仰望的事物。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Hadfield**: Yeah, and in fact, perhaps it's more important than ever. Uh, if you look at world history since the early 1990s, uh, we've had a strange 30-year bubble of peace with the fall of the **Soviet Union** and the collapse of the, you know, **Iron Curtain** and the wall in Berlin and all that. It's not our normal behavior. Uh, our much more normal historical behavior is one of conflict and and fear and jealousness over possessions and and such that that often flame, uh, the the the worst of of human behaviors. Uh, but even since the early 90s, we've had lots of of bad things happen. The **Gulf War** and and of course the the huge human conflict and loss of life that's going on at the other end of the Mediterranean and and in Ukraine right now. Um, and when there is conflict and that sense of nationalism and the decrease of optimistic internationalism that that began in the early '90s, um, I think when that happens, you want more, uh, good examples, things that people can look up to.

</details>

**Chris Hadfield**: 当所有这些事情发生时，世界上15个主要国家找到了和平合作的理由。在整个时期，**国际空间站**（International Space Station）24小时、每周7天都在运行。即使现在，尽管有所有的姿态和剑拔弩张，**美国**和**俄罗斯**以及**国际空间站**的所有其他伙伴仍然每天都在合作，进行科学研究，试图了解宇宙本身，观察我们的世界，并共同管理**国际空间站**。美国宇航员乘坐俄罗斯的**联盟号火箭**（Soyuz rocket）发射，就像我一样。俄罗斯宇航员乘坐美国的**龙飞船**和**猎鹰火箭**发射。这种合作是如此显而易见，世界上任何人在黎明或黄昏时都可以走出去，你只需去**NASA**网站查看它何时经过你家上空，你就可以出去观看。它是天空中继太阳和月亮之后第三亮的东西。下一个最亮的就是**国际空间站**。你可以看着它从地平线的一端飞到另一端。它是一个清晰可见的小信标，展示了我们做对事情时的行为方式。我们需要这样的榜样，因为我们总是会把其他事情搞砸。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Hadfield**: And, uh, while all that stuff has been going on, 15 leading nations of the world have found a reason to cooperate peacefully. 24 hours, seven days a week for that entire period on the **International Space Station**. And even right now with the with the all of the posturing and and saber rattling that's going on, um, the **United States** and **Russia** and all the other partners of the **International Space Station** are working together every single day doing scientific research, trying to understand the universe itself, observing our world, and also sharing command of the **International Space Station**. Americans launch on the Russian **Soyos rocket** like I did. Uh, Russians launch on the American, uh, **Dragon** and **Falcon rocket** and, uh, that cooperation is so visible that anyone in the world can walk out at dawn or dusk and you just have to go to the **NASA** site and see when it's going over your house, but you can go out and watch. It's the third brightest thing in the sky after the sun and the moon. Next brightest thing is the **International Space Station**. And you can just watch it go over your head from horizon to horizon. An unmistakable little beacon of of how we behave when we do things right. And and we need examples like that because we're always going to be messing the other stuff up.

### 生命的意义与宇航员的视角

**主持人**: 成员们有很多问题，关于你在外面待了一段时间后，如何看待世界和人类。**Johanna Z** 想知道，从你的角度来看，当你思考生命、意义和目的时，你几分钟前也提到了这一点，但你认为生命的意义是什么？这是个问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: There's so many questions, uh, from the the members about, um, just how how you think about the world, um, and humanity after spending some some time out there. Um, and **Johanna Z**, um, is curious, you know, from your perspective when you think about life and sort of meaning and purpose and you you touched on this a few minutes ago, but, um, you know, what do you see as the the meaning of life is is the question.

</details>

**Chris Hadfield**: 是的，这是个大问题。这是一个非常私人的问题，因为生命对不同的人意味着不同的东西。我认为它也意味着，我有一个七个月大的孙女，她对生命意义的回答会和我的十岁孙女、我四十岁的女儿，或者我和我妻子不同。在你生命的不同阶段，会有不同的目标和目的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Hadfield**: Yeah, it's big question. It's a very personal question because life means different things to different people. And I think it also means, you know, I have a seven-month-old granddaughter. Her answer to the meaning of life would be different than my 10-year-old granddaughter or my 40-year-old daughter or or my wife and I. At different stages of your life, there are different goals and purposes.

</details>

**Chris Hadfield**: 不过，我认为我的通用答案是，要有梦想，要有对你来说重要的事情。它们不一定对别人重要，但也许可以做一个小小的内心思想实验：如果我的生活从现在开始完美无缺，会发生什么？如果你对这个问题没有答案，那么你的梦想实现的几率就会大大降低。但如果你做过这个小小的自我思考实验，我到底梦想什么？我记得我十岁的时候，但现在我是一个忙碌的成年人，我不再梦想任何事情了。我认为这是一种自我毁灭的生活方式。你梦想的是什么？我不是指那些短暂的、无法控制的事情，比如中彩票什么的。我指的是那些你可以通过自己的选择真正塑造的事情。然后，一旦你决定了这些是生活中对你真正重要的事情，你真正想要拥有的，那些让你感到快乐、充实和自豪的事情。然后，一旦你有了这个清单，那么你今天下午、今晚或这个周末在做什么，以改变你自己，使你和你的生活朝着这些梦想稍微前进？你是如何通过你所做的每一个小决定来做到这一点的？因为你唯一能控制的就是你的小决定。我下一步要做什么？这是你唯一能真正控制的。我下一步要做什么？其他一切，你无法改变你已经做过的事情。未来只是一个可供选择的菜单。我下一步要做什么？但如果你没有这些个人化的、总体的完美定义，那么我不知道你如何选择下一步要做什么。你只是在刺激你的神经末梢吗？那可能暂时还行，但从根本上来说会令人失望。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Hadfield**: I think my generic answer though is, um, have dreams, have things that are important to you. They don't have to matter to anybody else, but maybe a little internal thought experiment. If my life goes perfectly from here forward, um, what will happen? Like, and if you don't have an answer to that question, then the odds of your dreams coming true are greatly diminished. But if you've gone through the little self-thought experiment, what is it that I actually dream of? I remember when I was 10, but now I'm a busy adult and I don't dream of anything anymore. I think that's a self-destructive way to live. What is it that you're dreaming of? And I don't mean the transient uncontrollable stuff like, you know, win the lottery or whatever. I mean things that you can actually shape, uh, through your through your own choices. And then once you've decided these are the actual things that are important to me in life that that I really want to have in my life that, um, that make me feel joyful and fulfilled and and proud. Um, and then once you have that list then what are you doing this afternoon or or this evening or this weekend in order to change who you are so that you are moving yourself and your life very slightly towards those dreams and how how are you doing that with all the little decisions that you make? Because that's the only thing you control is your little decisions. What what am I going to do next? That's the only thing you actually control. What am I going to do next? Everything else, you can't change what you did. The future's just a menu to choose from. What am I going to do next? But if you don't have those personal overarching definitions of perfection, then I I don't know how you choose what you're going to do next. Are you just stimulating your nerve endings? That's going to be maybe okay briefly, but it's going to be fundamentally disappointing.

</details>

**Chris Hadfield**: 惠特尼，也许最后一点是，不要让那些你人生中的大梦想来定义成功或失败。这是**克里斯**（Chris）关于美好人生的哲学，但不要让那些大梦想来定义成功或失败。尝试降低你的胜利门槛，你的胜利标准，这样你每天可以多次跨越它，因为没有人真正关心或理解你在做什么。他们可能会尝试，但这真的取决于你。所以不要说：“好吧，六年之后，我才会享受自己。”相反，尝试在你的日常工作中找到所有那些带来快乐、美好和个人化的事情，你可以引以为豪，可以微笑，可以稍稍沉浸其中，可以悄悄地自我庆祝，就像你正在引导你生活中这群庞大而难以驾驭的羊群，走向你梦想中的某个高处牧场。所以，是的，设定这些目标。做出强有力的日常、每时每刻的决定，朝着那个方向前进，并尽可能多地庆祝自己。对我来说，这就是美好的人生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Hadfield**: And and maybe the final piece of that, Whitney, is don't allow, and this is **Chris**'s philosophy on on life well-lived, but don't allow those big dreams of your life to define success or failure. Um, try and and lower your margin of victory, your your bar of victory so that you can get over it multiple times a day because nobody else really cares or understands what you're doing. They may try, but but that's really up to you. And so don't say, "Well, six years from now, I'm going to enjoy myself." Instead, try and find all the little joyful and and beautiful and personal things that are happening in and amongst your daily work that that you can take pride in, that you can smile at, that you can revel in a little bit, that you can quietly celebrate to yourself as you're you're hering this big intractable herd of sheep that is your life towards some some upper pasture that you're dreaming about. So, yeah, have those goals. Make strong daily, hourly, momentby-moment decisions to move yourself that way and celebrate yourself as as often as you can. To me, that is a life well-lived.

### 宇航员的写作之旅

**主持人**: 我喜欢这个。我想谈谈你的写作。你的作家工作将读者带入太空，但这次是通过历史小说。我想象小说为你提供了一个机会，以类似你通过太空飞行激发好奇心和对宇宙的惊奇的方式。那么，是什么激发你开始写关于太空探索的故事呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I love that. Well, I'd love to to move to some of your writing. Um, and you know, your your work as a writer takes readers to space, but this time sort of through historical fiction. And I imagine that fiction presents this opportunity for you to spark curiosity and and wonder about the universe in the similar way that you've also been able to do that through space flight. So what what inspired you to to start writing stories about space exploration?

</details>

**Chris Hadfield**: 嗯，我一直热爱阅读。我喜欢能够深入探究一个我从未见过的人的思想。你知道，这就像一种**共享心灵感应**。有人花时间尽可能优雅地将他们的思想和情感记录下来，这样我就可以在我方便的时候阅读它们，并尝试与那个人类产生共鸣。我喜欢阅读给我带来的力量和洞察力。我也喜欢被娱乐。我喜欢阅读，不仅仅是像我现在正在读的**《查士丁尼的逃亡》**（Justinian's Flee Now），那是一部关于**罗马帝国**末期和一场席卷欧洲的大瘟疫的引人入胜的历史，那是事实。但我真的很期待**李·查德**（Lee Child）的新**《浪子神探》**（Reacher）系列，因为它们读起来非常有趣。我喜欢完全沉浸在那样的思想或别人的书中。所以当我开始写作时，我最初写了三本非小说类书籍，它们都非常成功，都是畅销书。但是，我认为尝试分享太空飞行的巨大差异体验和宇航员的生活会是一个非常有趣的挑战，因为它仍然是所有职业中最稀有的之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Hadfield**: Well, I I've always loved reading. Uh, I I love being able to probe deeply into the thoughts of a person that I've never met. You know, it's like a form of, uh, **shared telepathy**. Someone has taken the time to as as eloquently as they can to lay their thoughts and emotions down into, you know, script so that then I can pick them up whenever's convenient for me and try and tap into that other human being. And I love the the power and the insight that I get from reading. I also love to be entertained. I like reading not just like I'm reading **Justinians flee now** which is a fascinating history of the end of the **Roman Empire** and the one of the big plagues that came through Europe, uh, which is factual but I'm really looking forward to the new **Reacher** you know **Lee Child** book because they're they're so much fun to read, um, I love being totally engrossed in in, uh, a thought like that or someone else's book and so when I set out to write I initially wrote three non-fiction books and they they've all done great. They're all, you know, bestsellers. But, um, I thought it would be a really fun challenge to try and share the wild difference of spaceflight experience and the life of an astronaut because it's still one of the very rarest of all professions.

</details>

**Chris Hadfield**: 如何尽可能丰富、全面和引人入胜地分享这些想法。你知道，我是一名音乐家。我写过并演奏过关于它的歌曲。我做过**BBC**系列节目，**国家地理**系列节目，我上过大师班，我在大学教书，我做过所有这些事情。但是写小说，突然之间你就可以深入到每个人的自发性直觉反应中，你可以从故事中多个不同角色的角度来看待同一个事件。所以，你真的可以为读者带来生动的体验。我把它当作一个巨大的挑战，就像学习成为一名**F-18战斗机飞行员**，或者学习指挥一艘飞船一样。目标是什么？你如何向专家学习如何做这件事？然后你如何发展自己的技能，以便也许你可以做到自己能力的极限？我非常自豪地说，我的最新书籍**《最终轨道》**（Final Orbit），这是我惊悚小说系列中的第三部，现在是全国畅销书第一名。所有书籍中的第一名。这听起来很疯狂，但这是事实。所以，很高兴其他人也像我期待写作一样期待着冒险和这些想法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Hadfield**: How to share those ideas as richly and wholesomely and and in engagingly as I I can. You know, I'm a musician. I've written and performed songs about it. I've done a **BBC** series, a **National Geographic** series, I did a master class, I teach at university, I've done all those things. But writing fiction, suddenly you can get into just everybody's spontaneous gut reaction and and you can look at the same event from multiple different characters within your story. So, so then you can really bring it to life for the reader. And I took it as a big challenge just like learning to be a an **F-18 pilot** or or or learning to command a spaceship. What is the goal? Um, how do you learn from the experts of how to do this thing? And then how do you develop your own skill set so that maybe you can do it to the limit of your own ability? And and I'm really proud to say my newest book, **Final Orbit**, which is the third in my thriller fiction series, it's the number one, uh, national bestseller right now. Number one of all the books. It's like that's sounds crazy, but that that's the truth. So, so it's great that other people are looking forward to the adventure and to the ideas as much as I look forward to writing them.

</details>

**主持人**: 评论中对你的写作有很多兴趣。我们有一个来自**Fans A**的问题，他问：“如果你今天重写**《宇航员地球生活指南》**（An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth），你会改变什么？你会添加任何新的故事吗？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Well, there's a lot of interest, uh, in the comments around your your writing. And we have a question from **Fans A** who says, "If you rewrote **An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth** today, is there anything you would change? Any new stories you would add?"

</details>

**Chris Hadfield**: 我想我下一本要写的书将是**《宇航员地球生活指南》**的青少年版。我的意思是，**《宇航员地球生活指南》**是关于如何过上更好生活的。我假装它是一本自传。但是，如果你读过它，你就会意识到它正如标题所说，是**《宇航员地球生活指南》**。它被很多人使用，令人惊讶的是，它已经被翻译成近30种语言。**山姆·休斯顿州立大学**（Sam Houston State）用它来制定一年级学生的基础课程，作为必读材料，一些南方牧师将其作为他们一系列讲座的中心主题。但我正在尝试将**《宇航员地球生活指南》**的目的，使其适用于处于人生关键阶段的人，大约10岁或12岁，当你开始认识世界，但除了你成长的那个小社区之外，你几乎一无所知。那么，有哪些大想法呢？我现在正处于写作过程中，决定如何最有效地做到这一点？我是以我写**《宇航员指南》**的风格来写，还是把它做成一个插图版的青少年版本？或者我是否挑战自己，尝试把它写成一个冒险故事，或者像**桑坦德的法国**（France by Santander）那样，一个引人入胜的故事，吸引那个年龄段的人，但其中也包含所有可能帮助他们做出更好生活选择的想法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Hadfield**: I think the next book I'm going to write will be a young adult version based on the on the purposes of **An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth**. I mean, **An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth** is how to lead a better life. I pretended it was a biography. Um, but but if you read it, uh, then you'll realize it it is exactly what the title says, **An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth**. And and it's been used by so many surprise. It's been in almost 30 languages. **Sam Houston State** used it to formulate the the fundamental curriculum for first year students compulsory reading and, um, some of the southern ministers made it the the central theme of a whole series of lectures that they gave. But, um, I'm trying to take the purposes of **An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth** and make it accessible to people who are at a really pivotal stage of life, which is around 10 or or 12 maybe, where you're becoming aware of the world, but you still hardly know anything beyond the the little community that you've grown up in. And what are some of the big ideas, but I'm I'm just in the writing process right now of deciding what is the most effective way to do that? Do I write it in the in the the style that I did, **Astronaut's Guide**, or do I make it like an illustrated young person's version of that? Or do I challenge myself with the task of trying to write it as an adventure or as you know, u **France by Santander** or or whatever an engrossing story that appeals to a human being at that age of development but that also has, uh, within it all of the ideas that might help them make better choices in their life.

</details>

**Chris Hadfield**: 顺便提一下，我有一个十岁的孙女。她住在中国，但我们每天都会在12小时的时差下一起阅读**《绿山墙的安妮》**（Ann of Green Gables），因为对于十岁的孩子来说，那是一本关于思想和行为的非常美好的书。所以，我会在她刚起床上学的时候抽出时间，她会早起和爷爷一起读书，或者如果我日程繁忙，她会在晚上做完作业后读。但如何用青少年的语言写出有用的想法，所以具体回答这个问题，是的，我正在重新思考**《宇航员地球生活指南》**中的想法，试图以尽可能清晰和有用的方式呈现给那些我希望会读它的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Hadfield**: Just a quick aside, I have a 10-year-old granddaughter. She lives in China, but, uh, every day with a 12-h hour time difference, we read **Ann of Green Gables** together because at 10 years old, that's such a beautiful book of ideas and behaviors and, um, and so I make time, uh, when she's just getting up for school, she gets up early to read with her grandpa or if my schedule's busy, she'll do it after she's done her homework at night. Um, but how to write useful ideas, uh, in the language of a young adolescent and and so to answer the question specifically, yeah, I'm rethinking the ideas that are in **An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth** to try and frame them as clearly and and as usefully as I can for the people that I hope will read it.

</details>

### 希望与挑战并存

**主持人**: 当你看到现在太空探索正在发生的事情时，什么让你感到充满希望？又是什么让你感到担忧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: When you look at what's happening right now with space exploration, what what makes you feel really hopeful? Um, and what what gives you pause?

</details>

**Chris Hadfield**: 两者都有。我的意思是，一切都让我感到充满希望，也让我感到担忧，生活就是这样，对吧？在个人层面、家庭层面、商业层面和物种层面，都很难把事情维持在一起。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Hadfield**: Uh, both. I mean, uh, everything makes me feel hopeful and gives me pause and that's how life goes, right? Um, and it's it's hard to keep things together at a personal level, at a family level, at a business level, and at a species level. Uh,

</details>

**Chris Hadfield**: 让我感到非常乐观的是人类不可思议的、不懈的、不可阻挡的想象和创造新事物的能力。你知道，我们几乎是唯一能够想象出尚未存在的事物的物种，如果不是唯一的话。而这正是我们巨大的杠杆，正是这一点赋予了我们在动物王国中的巨大优势，对吧？我们能够想象出尚未发生的事情，并采取行动，建造事物，做事情，预见即将发生的事情，而不仅仅是根据我们现在的感受做出反应。你知道，领导这个大型国际技术孵化器，或者看看世界各地正在发生的创造力。当你提到83亿人思想活跃时，我们能想出的东西简直是疯狂的。所以，这给了我极大的乐观。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Hadfield**: What gives me great optimism is the incredible, um, relentless unstoppable, uh, human ability to, uh, imagine and create new things. You know, we are almost the only species if not the only one that can imagine things that don't exist yet. And and we we that's our big lever that that's what has given us the great advantage in the animal kingdom, right? I is we can picture things that haven't happened yet and take action and build things and do things anticipating something that's coming and and not just reacting to how we feel right now and, uh, you know, leading this big international technology incubator or looking at some of the create creativity that's going on around the world. Uh, and when you said 8.3 billion people loose with the activity of their minds, it's it it's just wild the stuff we can come up with. Um, and and so that gives me great optimism.

</details>

**Chris Hadfield**: 我们物种的历史也给了我极大的乐观。尽管我们每天都有能力自我毁灭，停止所有文明，给自己造成不可弥补的伤害，但在几十万年之后，我们仍然在这里。尽管我们有破坏性，我们总能找到办法度过难关，并继续前进。我们有兴衰，但我们仍然在这里。所以当人们说：“哦，我们正在毁掉世界。”现在成为一个成年人，成为一个人，从来没有像现在这样困难，等等。这很难，但一直都很难。当你那样说的时候，你只是在展示你对历史的无知。我想你的曾祖父母不会说他们不担心存在主义。你知道，第一次世界大战，第二次世界大战，天哪，核武器的发明，麦卡锡主义，越南战争，这只是过去一百年的事情。所以，我对我们发明、创造和做事情的能力感到非常兴奋，这些事情总体上最终会改善人类的状况。我们现在人口足够多，正在慢慢地更好地认识到这种全球影响，以及我们将如何应对。你知道，如果我们只有一千人，我们就不必担心，但我们现在有足够多的人，我们需要在如何发电、如何处理垃圾等方面考虑这一点。但我们现在也正在发现很多很酷的东西。我们正在发现所有的小粒子，亚原子粒子，比原子还小的东西，谁知道呢，我们可能很快就会发现如何利用引力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Hadfield**: The history of our species gives me great optimism as well. Despite the daily ability to snuff ourselves out, to to stop all civilization, to do ourselves irreparable harm, we are still here after many hundreds of thousands of years. Despite our destructive nature, we find a way to muddle through and and keep and keep it going. And we have rises and falls, but we're we're still here. And and, um, so when people say, "Oh, we're ruining the world." And it's never been as hard to be an adult as it a human as it is right now and all of that. It's hard, but it's always been hard. You're you're just demonstrating your ignorance of history when you say stuff like that. Uh, I don't think your great-grandparents would have said they weren't worried about existentialism. Uh, you know, the first world war, second world war, the the gosh nuclear weapons being invented, the McCarthyism, Vietnam war, that's just the last hundred years. So, um, so I'm quite excited about our ability to invent and create and and do things that that overall end up being better for the human condition. And we're big enough now, uh, in population that that we're slowly gaining a better awareness of, uh, of that impact globally and what we're going to do about that. Uh, you know, if there were only a thousand of us, we wouldn't have to worry, but there's enough of us now that we just need to consider that in how we generate energy and what we do with our garbage and stuff like that, but we're also discovering just so much cool stuff right now we're discovering, uh, all of the small particles, the subatomic particles, things smaller than an atom and we who knows we may soon discover how to harness gravity.

</details>

**Chris Hadfield**: 我的意思是，就像我们学会了如何利用电力，如何移动电子一样。我们现在有一个探测器正在前往**木星**的一颗卫星，那颗卫星的水比地球还多，而且由于引力作用，它的中心有一个热源。也许那里有生命。我们正在**火星**上钻探寻找化石。我们有**詹姆斯·韦伯望远镜**（James Webb）和其他望远镜，正在分析围绕其他恒星运行的行星的大气层，试图找出我们是否是宇宙中唯一的生命。是的，我们经历着所有的麻烦，但同时也有日常的辉煌，我更感兴趣的是哪一部分，我很清楚。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Hadfield**: I mean, like we learned how to harness electricity how move electrons around. Um, we have a probe going to one of the moons of **Jupiter** now that is has more water. That moon of **Jupiter** has more water than Earth and it has a heat source at the middle because of gravitational poles. Maybe there's life there. Um, we're drilling on **Mars** looking for fossils. We have our **James Webb** and other telescopes actually analyzing the atmosphere of planets orbiting other stars to try and find out if we're alone in the universe or not. And and yeah, there's all the troubles that we go through but at the same time there's daily magnificence and, uh, I I know which part I'm more interested in.

### 应对不完美与探索的驱动力

**主持人**: 好了，在我们结束之前，有几个问题。其中一个问题来自两个人。**Richard S** 提出，如果我们作为一个物种，不能更好地照顾好我们眼前地球上的事物，我们为什么要被委托去管理一个不那么宜人的环境？然后，**Karina M** 提出了一个像是第二部分的问题：“我们如何在地球上培养出宇航员在太空中生存所需的同等程度的专注和团队合作？”我想知道你是否能提供一些智慧来帮助我们。

**主持人**: So we have, you know, a couple of questions as we're wrapping up here, uh, one that I want to ask you that's come from two different people. Um, so **Richard S** puts forward, you know, if we as a species can't take better care of what's right in front of us on the planet, why should we be entrusted to manage a less inviting environment? Um, and then which feels like a part two to this, **Karina M** says, "How can we cultivate the same level of focus and teamwork here on Earth that astronauts need to survive in space?" And I wonder if there's some, uh, wisdom that you can bring that, uh, to help us move.

**Chris Hadfield**: 我所有的智慧早就用完了，但我会尽力回答**理查德**（Richard）和**卡琳娜**（Karina）的问题。如果我们等到事情完美无缺，那我们将永远一事无成。如果我们说：“好吧，我必须把我的房子百分之百整理好，然后才能做其他事情。”那么你将永远不会做其他事情，因为你的房子永远不会百分之百整洁。我们必须认识到**不完美是常态**。我们需要解决那些大问题，那些最危及生命的问题，或者那些对生活质量或生存延续很重要的。我们必须解决这些问题。但如果我们等到把这些问题完全解决并做到完美，那么我们作为一个物种就会枯萎死亡，因为我们必须同时做其他事情。

**Chris Hadfield**: Any wisdom I had got tapped out long ago, but I'll do my best for **Richard** and **Karina**. Um, if we wait until things are perfect, then we will never get anything done. And and if we say, "Well, I I've got to get my house 100% in order before I ever do anything else." Well, then you'll never do anything else because your house will never be 100% in in order. We have to recognize that **imperfection is the norm**. Um, and we need to be working on the big problems, the the ones that are most, um, life-threatening or or or the ones that are important for quality of life or continuence of existence or whatever. We got to work on those. But if we wait until we get those completely nailed down and perfect, uh, then we will wither and die as a species because we have to be doing the other things as well.

**Chris Hadfield**: 观察我的孙辈们很有趣。我意识到，进化赋予我们行走的能力，远早于赋予我们说话和沟通的能力。去探索、去触摸事物、去体验事物、去舔舐一切、去了解一切的必要性，这对人类发展和人类本性来说是如此重要，这就是我们进化的方式。只有在后来，才有人能向你解释正在发生的事情。这将在我们的一生中继续显现，翻过下一座山丘、去探索、去尝试理解的必要性。我之所以担任**开放月球基金会**董事会主席，是因为，嘿，我们将在二月份把人送上月球，那是建立月球上第一个永久定居点的前奏。我们将如何做到这一点？我们不要仅仅将我们目前愚蠢的**地缘政治**混乱移植到月球上。也许这是一个转折点，我们可以做得更好。我不会说我们不能去月球，直到我们把地球变得完美。我正在做的是，说由于人类本性，我们不可避免地会在月球上建立定居点。所以，让我们利用一切可能的影响力，以及我所学到的所有教训，努力在历史的这个特定时刻，尽可能地把事情做好。对我来说，那是我生命中最重要的工作，影响其他人的思想，推动技术的边界，并努力让我们在未来有最大的机会做正确的事情。

**Chris Hadfield**: Watching my grandchildren is fascinating. What I've realized is, uh, evolution gave us the ability to walk way before it gave us the ability to talk and communicate. The necessity to go explore to to touch things to to experience things to lick everything to just find out about it. That that is so important for human in development and human nature that that's how we evolved. And it's only later that someone can explain to you what's happening. And that's going to continue and manifesting itself through all of life and the necessity to go over the next hill and to explore and to try and understand. And the reason I'm the chair of the board of the **Open Lunar Foundation** is, hey, we we're we're sending people to the moon in February, and that's the precursor to setting up the first permanent settlements on the moon. How are we going to do it? Let's not just transplant our current stupid **geopolitical** mess and just stick it on the moon. Maybe this is a turning of a page where we can do better. And I'm not going to say we can't go to the moon until we get Earth perfect. What I'm doing instead is saying we're inevitably because of human nature going to be setting up settlement on the moon. So, let's use every influence possible and every lesson that I can have learned possible to try and do it as well as we can at this particular time in history. And to me, that's that's, um, the most important stuff I'm doing in my life, influencing other minds, pushing the edges of technology, and, uh, and trying to give us the greatest chance of doing the right thing, uh, in the days to come.

**Chris Hadfield**: 惠特尼，谢谢你抽出时间，你如此敏锐和熟练地处理所有问题，并促使我继续发言这么久。和你交谈很愉快。我希望每个人都能喜欢这些想法，也许还有这些书，以及所有各种各样的事情。你只有一次生命。我在过去四个月里失去了我的父母，我从中领悟到的是他们过着美好而漫长的一生。你需要每天都去生活和爱。会发生什么真是令人惊叹。
