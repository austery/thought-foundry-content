### 伊朗局势概览

**Joe**: 你喜欢波斯食物吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Do you like Persian food?

</details>

**Joe**: 是的。哦，是的。绝对喜欢。我做了一个我非常引以为傲的菜，如果我自己说的话。一种叫做“sapsi”的美食。我其实不知道我发音是否正确，但据说它是伊朗的国菜，是一种牛肉炖菜，里面有菠菜和许多不同的香草。所以，它真的很绿，然后搭配芸豆，非常美味。我喜欢它的一点是，你可以做好它，然后储存起来，冷冻起来，它在一周左右的时间里会变得更好吃。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Yeah. Oh, yeah. Definitely. Yeah. I make I'm very proud of this if I say so myself. A mean gourmet sapsi. I actually don't know if I'm pronouncing it wrong, but supposedly it's the Iranian national dish, and it's a sort of like beef stew with spinach and a bunch of different herbs in it. So, it's really green and then with kidney beans, it's delicious. And the thing I like about it is you can make it and then store it, freeze it, and it actually gets better over the next week or so.

</details>

**Joe**: 我有一个开餐厅的想法，就是做好食物，然后放进冰箱过夜，再冷着吃，因为我觉得任何菜肴在冰箱里放一夜后风味都会更好。我当时想，为什么我们不就让这成为默认的用餐方式呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: This is my idea for a restaurant, which is just like make food and then put it in the fridge for overnight and then serve it cold cuz I think like every dish is better like after a night in the fridge somehow like all the flavors come out. I was like, why don't we just make this the default eating?

</details>

**Joe**: 我知道关于**伊朗**的情况很少。我也觉得在我职业生涯中，经历过多次这样的**大**规模抗议等等。这是政权更迭的时刻吗？而且正如你所说，当我看到报道时，我很少能完全信任。我对此持极其怀疑的态度。哦，今晚是我们多年来规模最大的抗议活动。从来没有过这样的抗议。看看这是哪个城市。我确定有消息灵通人士在谈论这个。我没有能力知道，一般来说，我不知道谁是消息灵通人士，什么才是真正的信号，什么才是噪音，但显然，又一个非同寻常的事件正在这里展开，在 2026 年。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: Look, I know very little about Iran. I also feel like in my professional career there are multiple rounds of this big protests etc. Is this the moment regime change? And to your point which you say like there is very little that I trust when I see it reported. I am extremely skeptical. Oh, tonight was the biggest set of protests we've had in years. There's never been a protest. Look at which city this is. I'm sure there are well-informed people talking about this. I don't have the heristics to know generally I don't know who is well informed what is actually signal versus what is noise but obviously yet another sort of extraordinary development unfolding here in uh 2026

</details>

**Tracy**: 你在听什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: ma what have you been hearing

</details>

**Matcha Voit**: 我同意，确实很难确定哪些是真实的事实。确实发生了许多死亡事件，这很可怕，很悲惨，死亡人数肯定有数千人。但同时，你知道，完全信息**黑幕**。现在还能用的是实际的固定电话外拨，但时间有限。所以，举个例子，我的一位分析师目前在**伦敦**，他能和他父母通话，但通话很快就会中断，但至少他能听到他们的消息。我们有一段时间不确定股市是否还在运作，因为**黑幕**，因为无法从伊朗官方新闻机构获取任何新闻。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Matcha Voit**: so I agree that it's difficult really to tell what are the actual facts for sure there's been a lot of deaths and uh it's horrible and it's tragic and it's definitely in thousands of of of deaths but at the same time, you know, there's complete blackout. What works right now is the actually outgoing landline calls but with limited time. So, for example, my one of my analysts who is actually in London at the moment, he's able to speak to his parents when they call him and then the call gets interrupted quite quickly, but at least he he can hear from them. We weren't actually sure for quite some time whether the stock market was working or not because of the blackout because it was not possible to even to read any news from the official news agencies in Iran.

</details>

**Matcha Voit**: 所以一切都停摆了，包括我读到的，甚至连伊朗国内非常受控的内部互联网网络也停摆了。甚至 ATM 暂时停止了工作。我想只是有一天短暂的时刻，现金转账还能用，银行转账也还能用。你知道，当地的类似 Uber 的叫车服务叫 Snap 一直都能用，但 GPS 工作不正常，所以很难定位司机等等。所以正如你所说，很难确切地了解发生了什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Matcha Voit**: So everything was down including from what I've read including even like the internal um domestic like an internet network in Iran that is uh that is very controlled. This was this was also down. Even ATM stopped working for a moment. uh I think just like a one day brief moment cash transfers were working bank transfers apparently the local you know Uber equivalent called snap was working all the time however GPS was not working properly so it was difficult to locate the driver and so on so exactly what you said it's it's it's difficult to understand exactly what is going on

</details>

**Tracy**: 这当然是 **Matcha Voit**，他是 **Amtalon Capital** 的首席执行官，这是一家专注于**伊朗股票**的基金，而这类基金并不多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: So this is of course Matcha Voit he is the CEO of Amtalon Capital which is a fund that specializes in Iranian equities and there aren't that many of those ground.

</details>

**Tracy**: 我甚至不知道是否有第二个这样的基金。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: I don't even know if there's a second one.

</details>

**Tracy**: 是的。所以，我们很喜欢和他交谈，他对**伊朗**地面上实际发生的事情有非常好的见解。我应该直接问的第一个问题是，你的团队还好吗？他们安全吗？你实际在伊朗的人员情况如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Yeah. So, we enjoy talking to him and he has really good insights into what is actually happening on the ground in Iran. The first question I should ask directly is, is your team okay? Are they safe and well, the people that you actually have in the country?

</details>

**Matcha Voit**: 谢谢你的关心，Tracy。我们在**德黑兰**有一个本地团队，其中一部分人目前在**伦敦**。现在，在德黑兰的分析师们，他们几 days 前在抗议活动变得更加激烈时，就离开了德黑兰，去了小城市，回到了他们的家乡。所以，我们最后一次听到他们的消息是几天前。当时，他们在一个安全的地方。所以我相信他们都还好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Matcha Voit**: Thank you for asking about that, Tracy. We have uh we have a local team in Thran, part of which is actually in London at the moment. Now, analysts who are in Tehran, who were in Tehran, they left Thran a few days ago when the protests were getting more intense to smaller cities to their hometowns. So, the last time we've heard from them was a couple of days ago. At that time, they were they were in a safe place. So, I believe they're they're all fine.

</details>

**Tracy**: 你的直觉如何？让我们先撇开“这是不是一个政权可能垮台的时刻”之类的问题。与过去二十年中出现的各种情况相比，这次在数量上或质量上有什么不同吗？当时互联网上充斥着伊朗抗议者的模糊视频，人们不禁要问：这次感觉有什么不同吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: I mean, just your intuition, let's actually set aside the question of like, is this a moment where the regime would get toppled or something like that, etc. Does this feel either quantitatively or qualitatively different from various episodes over the last two decades in which suddenly the internet is looking at fairly blurry videos of Iranian protesters and asking like does this feel different somehow?

</details>

**Matcha Voit**: 是的，确实不同。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Matcha Voit**: Yes, it definitely does.

</details>

**Matcha Voit**: 好的。首先，显然看看历史会告诉你不要过于兴奋或抱有任何有意义改变的希望。然而，这次确实感觉不同，也许有两点可能很有趣。首先，正如你一开始所说，Joe，这不是第一次抗议，而是多年来的又一次抗议。如果你看看类似的情况，比如**波兰**。波兰一直很贴近我的心。我最初是波兰人，当波兰试图摆脱苏联时，花了 9 年时间，每年都有大规模抗议，这次抗议你知道，就消失了，然后政府做出了非常残酷的反应。第二年又有一次抗议。在此期间，有戒严，军队在街上巡逻等等。但最终，许多事情汇集在一起，达到了一个临界点，一切都崩溃了。虽然它并没有真正崩溃，而是一次协商过渡到另一个政权。所以你知道，当权者获得了一个“下车坡道”可以继续前进，这是一次和平的、协商的过渡。**南非**的情况也类似，据我所知，你知道，发生在 80 年代，然后在 90 年代，伊朗确实发生了变化。情况不同，因为出于多种原因，**人口结构**发生了变化。所以现在你有大约 9300 万人，其中 5000 万人年龄在 15 到 49 岁之间，这是活跃人口的一部分，还有更多受过教育的年轻人，他们能够上网，有自己的愿望，他们不相信自己能在当前环境下实现这些愿望。他们也看着他们的父母，认为他们只是白白浪费了整整一代人的时间，你知道，等待和无所事事。所以，这让他们更加愤怒，也更加果断和对抗。这就是为什么我认为这次抗议如此激烈和广泛。另一个原因，另一件改变的事情是，你记得几年前，2022 年，2023 年，围绕社会自由曾发生过抗议，起因是一位名叫 Maramini 的伊朗女孩去世，这主要是由社会自由驱动的，主要涉及年轻人。现在，这次抗议是由**经济困难**驱动的，这触及了伊朗的每一个家庭。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Matcha Voit**: Okay. So first of all obviously looking at you know the history it teaches you not to get excited or to I don't know hopeful for any meaningful changes. However it does feel different and maybe maybe two things could be interesting here. First of all as you said Joe at the beginning it's it's not the first protest it's you know another protest over the years. And if you look at comparable situations for example Poland Poland is always close uh to my heart. I'm I'm Polish originally and Poland when we were trying to get rid of the Soviet Union it took 9 years and every year there was a massive protest this protest you know died and then uh you know with very brutal reaction from from the government. Then the next year there was another protest. In the meantime there was martial law with you know military on the streets and so on. But finally many things came together and there was a tipping point at which everything collapsed. Although it didn't collapse actually it was it was a negotiated transition to a different regime. So you know the establishment got a got an offramp to move on and it was a peaceful negotiated transition. Similar in South Africa based on what I know I mean it was you know happening in the 80s and then in the '90s uh there were actual changes in Iran. The situation is different because for many reasons demographics have changed. So now you have uh I believe around 93 million people out of which 50 million is between you know 15 and 49 years old like the active part of the population and there are many more young people who are educated who have you know access to internet have their own aspirations and they don't believe they can achieve those aspirations in the current environment and they also look at their parents and they think that they just wasted the whole generation, you know, waiting and doing nothing. So, this makes them more angry and also like more decisive and confrontational. That's why I think it's uh you know, the protests were so intense and so widespread. Another reason, another thing that's changed is like you remember a few years ago three uh 2022 uh there were in 23 there were protests around social freedoms after um an Iranian girl Maramini died and this was driven by basically by social freedoms and and mainly involved young people. Right now is driven by economic difficulties and this is this touches every every single household in Iran.

</details>

### 经济危机根源

**Tracy**: 是的，我想问你正是这一点，因为我不想说这是近期动荡的原因，但肯定其中一个火花似乎是**货币**的进一步**崩溃**，**通货膨胀**甚至更高。而且，银行那里是不是也出了什么问题？嗯，一家据称与政权有关联的银行破产了。**金融压力**在多大程度上影响了当前的**内乱**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Yeah. I wanted to ask you about precisely this because the I don't want to say the cause of the recent unrest, but certainly one of the sparks seems to have been a further collapse in the currency, even higher inflation. And wasn't there something about a bank as well? Um, a bank that was going bust um supposedly with ties to the regime. How much did financial stress play into the current round of civil unrest?

</details>

**Matcha Voit**: 100%，这是主要原因。你看，抗议始于**德黑兰**的**大巴扎**（Grand Bazar）。所以这些巴扎商（bazaris），我是指经营巴扎的人，他们中的许多人经营着数百万美元收入的公司。那里就像一个巨大的购物中心，有成千上万的小型或大型贸易商，他们需要稳定来做生意。这样的抗议革命是他们最不可能想到的事情，但他们正处于一种情况，你知道，他们中的许多人是进口商，要进口，你需要能够获得**硬通货**来支付你的供应商，无论是来自越南还是中国。但现在不可能获得，无法获得硬通货，或者根本没有足够的硬通货。这显然是因为**制裁**，因为制裁导致伊朗的出口锐减。伊朗只向**中国**出口石油，所以中国正在 dictating 所有条款，包括他们支付的价格大幅折扣，以及付款条款。你知道，中国支付的大部分款项是以**人民币**（yuan）支付的，并且存入某些中国银行的银行账户。所以伊朗，你知道，伊朗能做的就是购买一些中国商品。而伊朗需要的是支付**必需品**，比如一些他们需要不惜一切代价进口的食品或医疗产品。一旦他们将所有硬通货储备分配给这些必需品，留给其他企业的就不多了。所以，当你无法获得货币时，经营企业就很难，你知道，**通货膨胀**失控。但另一方面，你的消费者正在以惊人的速度失去购买力。所以基本上没有人购买。你可能需要花费你平均月薪的 10% 以上来购买鸡蛋、牛奶和面包。所以从经济方面来看，情况确实非常艰难。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Matcha Voit**: Well, 100% this was the main cause. Look, the protest started on the Grand Bazar in Tehran. So these uh bazaris, I mean people who operate bazaars, they many of them run like multi-million dollar revenue companies there actually. It's like this massive shopping mall with tens of thousands of you know smaller or bigger traders there and they need stability to just you know do business right. protesting revolution like this is the last thing they would think about but they are in a situation you know where that many of them are importers to import you need uh to be able to obtain a hard currency to just pay your supplier from Vietnam China whoever it's it's impossible to obtain to access hard currency or there's not enough of it and that's obviously because of sanctions because of sanctions exports of Iran just went down Iran is exporting oil only to China so China's is dictating all the terms including big discounts in the price that they are paying but also the terms of the payments. You know the China is paying a big part of their payments are in yuan and they and they arrive in bank accounts in some Chinese banks. So Iran, you know, the only thing Iran can do with it is is to buy some Chinese goods and and and what Iran needs is is to pay for essential goods like, you know, some food products or some medical products that they need to import at at any cost. And once they allocate all their hard currency reserves to those essential products, there is not much left for other businesses. So this is one thing that is difficult to run a business when you cannot obtain currency, you have uh you know inflation running wild. But on the other hand, your consumers are losing their purchasing power at an extraordinary pace. So no one is buying basically right. You have to spend on uh you know eggs, milk and bread probably you know more than 10% of your average uh monthly salary. So it looks it looks really difficult on the economic side.

</details>

**Tracy**: 我能很快问一下吗？你知道目前的**汇率**大概是多少吗？因为你知道，这是世界上少数几种我们无法在彭博终端上查到的货币之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Can I ask very quickly do you have a sense of what the current exchange rate actually is? because you know this is one of the few currencies in the world that we cannot look up on a Bloomberg terminal.

</details>

**Matcha Voit**: 是的，大约是 1 美元兑换 150 万里亚尔（realale），这意味着在过去十年里，它下跌了约 97%-98%，在去年的以（色列）战争之前，下跌了近 50%。所以，在过去的 7 个月里。它真的，真的在快速下跌。哦，还有一件事，你问到了银行。是的，实际上几个月前伊朗有一家**银行倒闭**。我是说，他们正式承认它应该被国有化，这很不寻常，因为倒闭的规模如此之大，以至于影响了国家的预算，今年的国家预算。所以他们不得不减少补贴，并改变预算支出，为必须投入这家银行的金额腾出空间，我想是 50 亿美元，这样它就不会崩溃。这基本上是，这是另一个让人们愤怒的例子，因为这是一个巨大的**腐败**案例。所以，你知道，有一个与当地有关系的企业家，他经营着几家建筑公司，而且情况不是他打电话给几家银行要求一些优惠贷款。不，他自己成立了一家银行，提供了市场上最高的利率。所以，很多人只是把他们的存款存入这家银行，然后他用这些存款向自己的公司发放贷款。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Matcha Voit**: Yeah, it's around 1.5 million realale per $1, which means it went down uh around 97 98% over the last decade and around almost 50% since before the war with Israel last year. So over the last 7 months. So it's really it's really falling fast. Oh, and one more thing you asked about the bank. Yes, actually there was a bank collapsing in Iran just a few months ago. I mean they formally recognized that it should be nationalized and it's extraordinary because the size of the collapse it was so big that it actually affected the budget of the country the country budget for this year. So they had to reduce subsidies and and just change you know the expenditures of the budget to make room for the amount that they had to I think it was like $5 billion that they had to put into this bank so that it doesn't you know collapse. It was basically and it's another it's another example that you know makes people angry obviously because it's it's it was a huge example of corruption. So, you know, there was a local well-connected entrepreneur who was running a few construction companies and it wasn't the case that, you know, he called a few banks and asked for some preferential loans. No, he set up a bank, offered the highest interest rates on the market. So, many people just put their deposits into this bank and then he was using those deposits to make loans to his own companies.

</details>

**Tracy**: 我认为大部分贷款都是给了他自己的公司。他建造了该地区最大的**购物中心**，这从一开始就是一个疯狂的想法，还有很多类似的事情，对吧？所以，又是**腐败**的一个例子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: I think it was like a majority of the loans were to his own companies. He built the biggest shopping mall in the in the region, which was, you know, a crazy idea from the beginning and many things like this, right? So, another example of thronism and corruption.

</details>

**Joe**: 这是那个购物中心，它和**五角大楼**一样大，或者差不多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: This is the shopping mall that's like as big as the Pentagon or something.

</details>

**Tracy**: 是的。是五角大楼的两倍大。根据我读到的《**华尔街日报**》的文章，是五角大楼的两倍大，这个位于伊朗的豪华购物中心正遭受着巨大的**恶性通货膨胀**和其他各种问题。但我不得不说，自己开一家银行，然后用它来资助你的建筑公司，这算是一种绝妙的主意。B，这就是为什么银行监管和各种机制存在的原因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: Yeah. Twice as big. According I I read the Wall Street Journal article, twice as big as the Pentagon, this luxury shopping mall in Iran suffering from massive hyperinflation and all the sorts. But I have to say starting your own bank to then just fund your construction company, a kind of a brilliant idea. B, this is why bank supervision and various things

</details>

**Joe**: 是重要的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: is important

</details>

**Joe**: 这对我来说太超现实了，这里的现实是，这个国家现在是一个事实上的**信息黑洞**。你提到我们不知道**股市**是否在交易。这里有一个国家，就在此刻，我们身处纽约，或者你身处伦敦，我们甚至无法回答一个简单的问题：股市现在是否在运行？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Joe**: actually exist. It's surreal to me this reality of here is a country that right now is a de facto information black hole. You mentioned we don't know if the stock market is trading. Here's a country on earth and right now where we are in New York or where you are in London, we can't even answer the simple question, is the stock market functioning right now?

</details>

**Matcha Voit**: 是的，没错。所以我听到的所有故事是，人们能够沟通的方式是因为有人能够使用在伊朗运行的**Starlink**，或者某人的朋友在医院工作，医院能够访问广域网或一些本地网络。所以这也是为什么这个国家无法长时间保持如此大规模和强度的**信息封锁**，因为你知道整个经济都会停滞。实际上，国家的行政管理没有互联网是无法进行的。所以，它曾经是，它曾经是急剧的、强烈的，但它必须是短期的，因为否则，你知道，国家就会停滞。在这种特定情况下，你的投资组合会怎么样？你的投资。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Matcha Voit**: Yeah, exactly. So all the stories that I that I hear is that the way people were able to communicate is because someone had access to a Starlink operating in Iran or someone's friend was working at a hospital and hospital had some access to either the wide internet or some of these local networks. So that's why also it's it's not possible for the country to keep the blackout at this scale and intensity for too long because you know the whole economy stops right actually the administration of the countries is not possible right without uh without internet so it's it was it was sharp intense but it has to be shortterm because otherwise you know the country will will just stop. what happens to your portfolio in this particular scenario, your investments.

</details>

### 金融市场分析

**Matcha Voit**: 过去一周，**股市**似乎一直比较稳定。我还没有看到确切的数字，比如流动性方面。而且我怀疑，你知道，并没有太多交易活动，因为我不确定本地投资者是否有机会在线下单，对吧？也许是老派的方式，你知道，打电话给你的经纪人或去你的经纪人那里。所以，它很稳定。所以，所以，所以实际上什么都没有发生，实际上它上涨了 4%，货币也稳定。当流动性较低时，央行更容易通过使用一些储备来操纵货币。所以，我认为更有趣的是接下来的几周。例如，去年战争之后发生了什么，当伊朗和以色列之间发生战争时，股市关闭了大约两周。重新开放后，价格变化不大。但随后，本地投资者，主要是散户投资者，这个散户驱动的市场开始抛售，因为他们无法获得资金。所以他们不计一切代价抛售，只是为了套现。然后出现了巨大的抛售压力，持续了从 7 月到 9 月。当买家看到这样的抛售压力时，你每天都能看到未成交订单的队列不断累积，会延续到第二天、第三天。所以人们显然也停止了购买。所以市场下跌了，你知道，无论是什么股票，什么质量，什么估值，只是一个巨大的抛售，持续了两个月，然后反弹。所以，以美元计算，从指数的 360 点左右跌至 230 点。是的，如果我没看错的话。所以，在短短两个半月内，以美元计算下跌了约 36%。然后抛售压力耗尽了。所有的抛售，所有的销售都被吸收了。估值跌至我认为非常接近伊朗股市 20 年历史上的**历史低点**。所以，你知道，它总是很便宜，对吧？但这次它跌破了市盈率的三倍，是市场的中位数市盈率，对吧？所以，你可能会找到市盈率只有两倍的股票。然后它反弹了，但仍然大约是市盈率的三倍半。所以，估值在很大程度上仍然受战争驱动。所以一切都是**为战争定价**的，对吧？所以，这是自上次战争以来，市场情绪一直没有真正恢复，现在我们又经历了抗议。所以伊朗的一切基本上都是为战争定价的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Matcha Voit**: So, the stock market seems to have been stable over the last week. I don't see the exact numbers yet in terms of, for example, liquidity. And I and I suspect that, you know, there was not much going on because I'm not sure if even local investors had a chance to were able to put orders online, right? Maybe maybe it was old school, you know, calling your broker or going to your broker. So, it was stable. So, so, so nothing actually actually it went up by 4% and the currency was stable too. The currency is easier to to manipulate by by the central bank using some reserves especially when when there is low liquidity. So, I think what will be more interesting is the next few weeks. So, for example, what happened last year after the war when there was a war between Iran and Israel in June, the stock market was shut down for around two weeks. After it reopened, the prices didn't change much. But then local investors, mainly retail investors, this uh retail driven market started selling because they didn't have access to their funds. So they started selling at any price just to get money out. And there was a massive selling pressure that lasted from July until September. And when the buyers saw a selling pressure like this, so every day you can see the queue of unfilled orders building up that will go to the next day and the next day and the next day. So people just stopped buying as well obviously. So the market went down like uh irrespective of you know which stocks, what quality, what valuation or whatever just a massive sell-off which lasted two three months and then it rebounded. So um it went down like in dollar terms from let's say index of I don't know 360 to 230. Yes, if I'm if I'm looking at at this correctly. So let's say 36% in dollar terms in just two and a half months. The selling pressure then was exhausted. All the selling all the sales were were absorbed. valuations went down to the one of the I think very close levels to the like all-time lows in the history of the of the Iranian stock market which is around 20 years old. So, you know, it's always cheap, right? But this time it went, you know, below three times uh net earnings a median median for the market, right? So, you could probably find stocks, you know, at two times earnings. Then it rebounded, but it's still around, you know, like three and a half times earnings. So, valuations are very much still driven by war. So everything is priced for war, right? So that's that's the sentiment hasn't really recovered after the last war and now we had protests. So everything in Iran is priced for war basically.

</details>

### 社会群体构成

**Tracy**: 你知道，新闻里我们听到的，或者我认为我们能更好地理解的，而且我再次承认我有很多无知。我对此不太熟悉，但抗议者想要什么？你听到**年轻人**想要更多的**自由**。你能给我一个政治经济学的分析吗？比如，你听不到那些显然不想要政权更迭的人的声音，一般来说，我们对他们知之甚少，或者他们是谁。从社会经济学的角度来看，不同派别是什么？他们如何倾向于哪一方？我猜是一种阶级层面的理解，关于紧张关系。嗯，有一大群年轻人，年轻人想要自由和机会，以及经济上的公平规则。基本上，还有大城市里年长一些的成年人，他们比德黑兰更自由。德黑兰是一个大城市，有大约 1200 万人，德黑兰的生活与其他伊朗城市不同，你知道，女性不再戴头巾，也许那里更开放，更自由。但也有很大一部分人非常非常虔诚，他们支持政府，那也是一个宗教政府。所以，**伊斯兰共和国**的概念对他们来说非常重要，他们支持它，这是他们宗教和传统的一部分。嗯，所以从观察宗教节日、去清真寺、以某种方式着装等方面来看。那么，这种分裂是怎样的？我想说，大约 10% 到 30% 是虔诚的部分，10% 是非常虔诚的，只是听祈祷，以及来自清真寺的任何政治建议等等。30% 或可以说三分之一的社会只是虔诚地支持伊斯兰共和国作为一个宗教国家。只是一个小说明，它是一个伊斯兰共和国，但对其他宗教非常宽容。我是说，所有的教堂都在那里正常运作，从犹太教到基督教再到琐罗亚斯德教，你知道，每个人都在伊朗做自己的事情，而且没关系。所以，其余的人是想要一个现代开放的国家的人，包括年轻人，他们基本上想要快速实现，并且想要能够追随他们的梦想和愿望。所以，这就是构成。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy**: You know in the news obviously we hear or I think we get a better grasp and again I plead a lot of ignorance. This not something I have a lot of familiarity with but what the protesters want and you hear about young people and wanting more freedoms. Can you give a sort of I don't know political economy breakdown of like you know you don't hear about the people who obviously don't want regime change generally speaking they we don't know much about them or who they are. Who are the sort of different factions socioeconomically that and how they allocate to either side sort of I guess a a class understanding of the tensions. M h so there's a big group of young people and young people want freedom and opportunities and like fair rules in the economy basically there are older people adults in larger cities which are more liberal definitely than tean is a big city it's like 12 million people altogether and life in Thran looks different to most other cities in Iran with you know women no longer wearing hijab perhaps it's much more open. It's much more liberal. But also there is a big group of people who are very very religious and they support the government that is also um there is a religious government. So they the the concept of Islamic republic is very close close to their heart and they support it and and it's part of their religion and part of their traditions. uh so in terms of you know the how they observe religious holidays uh uh you know going to mosque uh dressing in a in a certain way and so on and now how does this split I would say that uh probably between 10 and 30% is the religious part 10 like very religious and just listening to the to the prayer and you know whatever political advice comes from the mosque and so on 30% or let's say a third of the society just being religious and and supporting the um Islamic Republic in the as as a religious uh state. Just a small note that it's an Islamic republic but very tolerant of of other religions. I mean all the churches work normally there from um Jewish to Christian to Zarustrian you know everyone is doing his own thing in terms of religion in Iran and it's and it's okay. So, and the rest are people who want a modern open state with the young including the young people who want it fast basically and and and want to be able to follow their dreams and aspirations. So, so, so that would be the breakdown.

### 未来走向推测

**Joe**: 那么，我应该说我们正在**1 月 15 日**录制这个节目。现在新闻更新得很快。所以，谁知道在我们发布这期节目（大约 24 小时后）时会发生什么。但最新的头条新闻是，由于伊朗政府表示他们不会再杀害任何人，或者告诉**特朗普**他们不会再处决任何人，与美国的关系似乎有所缓和。我们应该如何解读？这一切都结束了吗？还是你预计会有一些动荡继续下去？

**Joe**: So, I should just say we're recording this on January 15th. The headlines are coming pretty fast nowadays. So, who knows what will happen by the time we publish this episode in just 24 hours or so. But the latest headline is that tensions seem to have eased a little bit with the US because the Iranian government said they're not going to kill any more people or told Trump they're not going to execute more people. How should we interpret that? Is this all over or do you expect uh some unrest to continue?

**Matcha Voit**: 嗯，很难预测。这是非常不可预测的。我是说，动荡很难预测，围绕动荡的动态也很难预测。你知道，伊朗政府很难预测，但你知道，美国政府也很难预测，因为你知道，现在，昨天，今天，昨天你看到新闻，你看到新闻说特朗普总统说，是的，他得到消息说杀戮停止了，这就是他想要的，他想达到的目标，所以看起来好多了。前一天，每个人都认为他们正准备打击伊朗。所以，我认为这些事情在 24 小时内都可能改变，所以这是不可能预测的。我唯一想说的是，因为这次感觉不同，抗议的规模和抗议的原因，而且政府也无法通过花钱来解决问题。经济状况确实很艰难，但一些改变是可能的。我不是说在接下来的几天或几周内，也许需要几个月，但我认为它正朝着这个方向发展。所以，一些改变是可能的，许多情景也是可能的。我是说，看看**委内瑞拉**。那里没有发生政权更迭，对吧？我是说，又一次协商解决方案，你知道，马杜罗被赶下台，政府和当权者留任，但他们必须合作，对吧？所以，未来可能不止一种情景。我们生活在一个怎样的世界，**内乱**正在成为一个主要的投资主题。谢谢你，Matcha，来到 Lots More。非常感谢你再次带来最新消息。

**Matcha Voit**: Well, it's hard to predict. It's it's it's very unpredictable. I mean unrest is difficult to predict the dynamics around the unrest. Then you know the government of Iran is difficult to predict but you know the government of the US is difficult to predict because you know right now yesterday today yesterday you had news you had news that President Trump was saying that yes he got information that you know killing stopped so this is what he was you know what he wanted to achieve so it looks better the day before everyone thought that you know they are getting ready to strike Iran so I think those things can change in 24 hours so it's it's it's just impossible to predict the Only thing I would I would say is that because it does feel different this time the scale of the protests and the reasons of the protest and also the government just can't spend you know their way out of the problem. It's it's the the financial situation is really tough but some changes are likely. I'm not saying that within the next few days or weeks maybe it will take months but I think it's just moving this direction. So there are some changes that are likely and many scenarios are possible. I mean look at Venezuela. There was no regime change there, right? I mean there was a like again negotiated solution with you know Maduro taken out and and the rest of the uh government and establishment just in place but but they have to cooperate right. So there's probably more than one scenario possible uh for the future. What a world we live in where civil unrest is uh becoming a major investment theme. Thank you, Matcha, for coming on Lots More. Really appreciate another update from you.
