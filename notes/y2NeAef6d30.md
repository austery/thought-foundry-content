<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**All**: All right, everybody. Welcome back to the number one podcast in the world.

**Jal**: 你被邀请去**达沃斯**了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jal**: you have been invited to Davos.

</details>

**Jason**: 什么？我得把我的吉他拿出来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: What? I got to get my guitar.

</details>

**All**: 哦，**达沃斯**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**All**: Oh, Davos.

</details>

**Jason**: 我要带我的吉他去。别搞砸了。**Saxs**，给听众解释一下这里发生了什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: I'm going to bring my guitar. Don't blow it. And explain to the audience what's happening here, Saxs.

</details>

**Saxs**: 发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: What's happening?

</details>

**Jason**: 嗯，事实证明，那里的一个会场需要内容。所以，他们为**All-In**提供了一个舞台来采访人们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Well, as it turns out, one of the houses there is in need of content. So, they've offered all in a stage to interview people.

</details>

**All**: 好的。所以我们有舞台麦克风。你要去……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**All**: All right. So, we got stage microphone. You're going

</details>

**Jason**: 我要去。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: I'm going. Yeah,

</details>

**Saxs**: 我听说**特朗普总统**周三将在那里发表重要讲话。呃，所以那里有一个舞台和麦克风。我取消了我的日本滑雪之旅，去**达沃斯**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: President Trump is giving a major talk there on Wednesday, I understand. Uh, and so there is a stage and microphones. So, I'm I canceled my ski trip in Japan to go to Davos.

</details>

**All**: 连**Jason**也去。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**All**: Even Jason is going

</details>

**Saxs**: 连**J**也去。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: Even J.

</details>

**All**: 连**JC**也去**达沃斯**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**All**: Even JC is at Davos.

</details>

**Saxs**: 连**JC**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: Even JC.

</details>

**Jason**: 我的意思是，这很有趣。我被邀请参加那个，就像你以前可能也收到过这种邀请，成为他们年轻领导人的一部分，每年5万美元。所以我们会在那里做一些采访，如果你想在**美国之家**接受我和/或**Saxs**的采访，如果你在那里，如果你有演讲者的想法，请发邮件到jasonallin.com，我们会实时预订。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: I mean, it's pretty funny. I was invited to be part of that like um you probably got this tuchimoth back in the day like they're young leaders for $50,000 a year. So we're going to be doing some interviews and uh if you want to be interviewed by me andor saxs at the USA house, email jasonallin.com if you're there, if you have ideas for speakers and we're going to be booking in real time.

</details>

**Chamath**: 我没去过**达沃斯**。我想它的运作方式是那里有很多会场。所以，国家有会场，然后公司赞助会场。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: I haven't been to Davos. I guess the way it works is there's a bunch of houses. So, countries have houses and then companies sponsor houses

</details>

**Saxs**: 而且那里有很多活动。有舞台搭建，还有持续的采访。所以，我收到了很多请求。基本上，在**达沃斯**，每个人都在采访其他人。这说得通吗？我的意思是，所有与会者都在不停地互相采访。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: and there's stuff happening there. There's like stages set up and there's constant interview. So, you know, I've gotten a bunch of requests. Basically, everyone's interviewing everyone else at Davos. Does that make sense? I mean, it's like all the attendees are just constantly interviewing each other.

</details>

**Jason**: 这就像播客圈。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: It's like the podcast circuit.

</details>

**Saxs**: 所有这些播客现在都用完了嘉宾，所以他们只是在一个巨大的圈子里互相采访。就是这样。这简直就是，是的。国家元首采访国家元首。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: All these podcasters now have run out of guests, so they just interview each other in a giant circle. That's what it is. This is literally going to be Yeah. heads of state interviewing heads of state.

</details>

**All**: 是的。每个人都在互相采访。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**All**: Yes. Everyone's just interviewing everybody.

</details>

**Jason**: 嘿，欢迎来到**JD Vance**秀。我是**JD Vance**。今天节目中和我在一起的是**Mandami**。欢迎来到节目。大家都在那里做合作。蛇吞了自己的尾巴，但我想我们会玩得很开心。我和**Sachs**要去，我们会大闹一场，玩得开心。我听说**美国之家**就在那里的一条主街上。呃，我的理解是，我当时正在和**McKenzie**的CEO谈话，他是赞助**达沃斯**很多活动的合作伙伴之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Hey, welcome to the JD Vance show. I'm JD Vance. With me on the show today is Mandami. Welcome to the show. Everybody's doing collabs there. The snake has eaten its tail, but I think we'll have a fun time. Me and Sachs are going and we're going to we're going to tear it up and have a good time. The USA House, I understand, is like on a main street there. And uh my understanding is I was talking to the CEO of McKenzie who's one of the partners I guess who who sponsors a lot of the stuff at Davos.

</details>

**Freeberg**: 看看你，和全球精英打成一片，和**深层政府**聊天发短信。这太棒了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Freeberg**: Look at you rubbing elbows with the global elite talking texting with the deep state. This is fantastic.

</details>

**Jason**: 是的。不，我要去，这是**深层政府**。这是我进入2026年的**深层政府**时代。呃，据说**Saxs**，那里的氛围是人们在主城区四处走动，他们会随意走进**美国之家**，他们会进行社交，喝杯咖啡。他们喝杯咖啡，然后我们要做的是让制作人**Lisa**说：“嘿，你听**All-In**吗？嘿，很高兴见到你。你愿意和**David**和**Jason**聊聊吗？”他们会坐在那里，我和**David**会主持。会很有趣。我很期待。我们有点像街头采访。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Yeah. No, I'm going it's a deep state. It's my deep state era going into 2026. And um there's supposedly what the vibe is Saxs is people just kind of walk around the main town and they'll just pop into USA House and they network have a have a coffee. They take a coffee and then what we've got to do is have producer Lisa say, "Hey, do you listen to Allin? Hey, it's great to see you. Would you like to talk to David and Jason?" They're going to be sitting over here and just me and David are going to uh hold court. It's going to be fun. I'm looking forward to it. We have kind of like a little little man on the street.

</details>

**Saxs**: 我们可能会，你知道，我做过一些街头采访，我们可能会拿一个无线麦克风上街看看会发生什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: We might, you know, I've done a little uh vox pop in my deck and uh we might we might get a wireless microphone and go on the street and see what happens.

</details>

**All**: 这只会持续5分钟，直到人们听到**Jake**令人讨厌地提问。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**All**: This is going to last 5 minutes until people hear that Jake is is being obnoxious and asking

</details>

**Jason**: 你知道，**Jake**，人们不知道，但**Jal**模仿**Triumph the Insult Comic Dog**非常棒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: question. You know, Jake, people don't know this, but Jal does an incredible Triumph the Insult comic dog impression.

</details>

**Jal**: 哦，是的，我会的。我会的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jal**: Oh yeah, I do. I do.

</details>

**All**: 哦，天哪。如果你四处走动……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**All**: Oh my god. If you went around.

</details>

**Jal**: 哦，老兄。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jal**: Oh, dude.

</details>

**Jason**: 哦，是的。看起来是德国总理。我明白了。你及时关闭了核电站。数据中心项目进展如何？我听说15岁的**Greta**正在负责你的能源节约和战略。这进展如何？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Oh, yes. It looks like it's the prime minister of Germany. I understand. You turned off your nuclear at the right time. How's the data center project going? I heard the 15year-old Greta is uh doing your energy conservation and your strategy. How's that going for you?

</details>

**All**: 这不会再持续了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**All**: It's not gonna last up again.

</details>

**Jason**: 是的，我们会在**达沃斯**被拘留。好了。好了，我想我们得谈谈**伊朗**正在发生的事情。**政权更迭**可能正在发生。过去一个月里，发生了大规模的反政权抗议。正如所有听众可能都知道的，**伊朗**自**1979年革命**以来一直由一个**伊斯兰独裁者**统治。**Ali Kumeni**自**1989年**以来掌权。如果你想了解为什么会发生这种情况，短期内你可能需要知道两个数据点。呃，过去六七年，**通货膨胀**一直很疯狂。如果你认为疫情期间7%、8%、9%的**通货膨胀**很严重，现在人们抱怨2.6%，看看这张图表吧，伙计们。呃，自2019年以来，由于**经济制裁**，平均**通货膨胀**率达到了30%。显然，这些措施是有效的。出现了粮食短缺，人们长期走上街头。这是一张2020年的图表。所以，你可以在你看到的图表上再加六年。但是，呃，**伊朗**有很多年轻人，人口由很多二三十岁的人组成。他们有**星链**（**Starlink**），他们有访问权限和**VPN**。所以，他们想成为未来的一部分。他们想现代化。**Sachs**，这是去年一个争议点。我们当时在谈论干预，你知道，对外战争以及你对此的担忧。这次是自下而上的。所以我认为这很不一样。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Yeah, we're gonna be detained at Davos. All right. All right, I guess we got to talk about what's going on in Iran. Regime change could be happening. There have been massive anti-regime protests over the last month. As everybody listening probably knows, Iran has been ruled by an Islamic dictator since the 1979 revolution. Ali Kumeni is uh in power since 1989. And if you want to understand why this is happening, there's probably two data points that you should know in the short term uh last you know six seven years inflation has been bonkers. If you think you know 7 8 9% inflation during co was acute and and you know 2.6 now people complaining about uh take a look at this chart boys. Uh it's it's been 30% on average since 2019 due to sanctions. Obviously, those things uh can work. There's been food shortages, people in the streets long-term. Here's a chart, and this is from 2020. So, you can add six years to the chart you're seeing here. But, uh there's a lot of young people in Iran, and the populace is made up of a lot of 20somes and 30somes. And they have Starlink and they have access and VPNs. And so, they want to be part of the future. They want to modernize sachs. This was a point of contention last year. We were talking about interventions going on, you know, foreign wars and your concerns about that. This one is from the bottom up. So I think that makes it quite different. Yeah.

</details>

### 伊朗局势与信息战

**Saxs**: 嗯，你看，这是一个高度动态的局势。我真的不想对此发表评论，除了说我相信**特朗普总统**会做出正确的决定并处理好它。据我了解，抗议活动目前要么正在消退，要么正在被镇压。我倾向于认为它正在平息，但我不确定。这是一个动态的局势。我真的，你看，问题是每当我评论这样的事情时，最终都会变成“**特朗普**顾问**David Sax**说……”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: Well, look, this is a highly dynamic situation. And I don't really want to comment on something except to say that I trust President Trump to make the right decision and handle it. As I understand it, the protests are either fizzling out or being cracked down on at this point. And I tend to think it's dying down, but I'm not sure. And it's it's a dynamic situation. I really Look, the problem is whenever I comment on something like this, it ends up being Trump adviser David Sax says whatever.

</details>

**Jason**: 是的，会被剪辑。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Yeah. get clipped and

</details>

**Saxs**: 现实情况是，我只参与两个问题，这不属于其中之一。所以我真的不认为我应该发表评论。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: and the reality is I'm only involved on two issues and this isn't one of them. So I don't really think I should be commenting.

</details>

**Jason**: 是的，**Freeberg**，你一直在谈论这个，呃，我想这是你上周节目中预测的一部分，预测节目。这是你的**Polymarket**数据，然后我会让你发表你的看法。**Kani**在1月31日前卸任**伊朗**最高领袖，这个概率曾高达27%，现在已降至10%。**政权**会在2027年前垮台吗？交易量260万美元，37%的几率。这个几率曾高达50%多。这是在年底之前。所以，呃，显然这是一个突发新闻式的局面，到我们周四录制的时候，大家知道我周五就不在了。所以这可能会发生根本性的变化。**Freeberg**，你对此有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Yeah, Freeberg, you've been talking about this and uh I think it was part of your predictions from the show last week, the prediction show. Here's your poly markets and then I'll let you give your thoughts on it. Kani out as supreme leader of Iran by January 31st. that was up uh around 27% and now has dropped to a 10% chance. And will the regime fall before 2027? $2.6 million in volume. 37% chance. It's been up there as high as I think 50 some odd percent. And this is before the end of the year. So h obviously a breaking news type situation by the time we tape on Thursdays as everybody knows I'm out on Fridays. So this could be radically changing. Just broad strokes. What are your thoughts here, Freeberg?

</details>

**Freeberg**: 我的意思是，我认为由于**经济制裁**的影响，这个国家出现崩溃是不可避免的。**伊朗**的平均月收入约为200美元。而食品价格与美国大致相同，可能比美国略低。我的意思是，我刚刚查了一下，在德黑兰，麦当劳的套餐相当于4美元。所以，如果你每月挣200美元，去麦当劳要花4美元，成本很快就会赶上来。我认为最终导致社会崩溃的是当人们无法负担他们所需的东西时，人们别无选择，只能站起来。一个压迫性的制度，一个压迫性的政权可以压制人们很久，直到他们挨饿或无法获得医疗保健等东西。这些都是最终导致这些时刻发生的原因。所以，这似乎是不可避免的。美国对**伊朗**政权施加了很大压力，它似乎开始崩溃。每个人都在问的关键问题是，**特朗普**是否会采取行动支持这场革命，这理论上我想会涉及攻击**IRGC**（**伊斯兰革命卫队**）的地点，**IRGC**是维持政权对人民控制的内部安全部队。如果他们摧毁**IRGC**的地点，这真的会导致人民获得自由吗？过渡计划是什么？这显然是一个非常混乱的局面。**Reza Palavi**在欧洲，他说他准备回来，他是沙阿的儿子。如果他回来，你将如何给他影响力和控制权？这与最近在**委内瑞拉**出现的问题相同。政府机构需要一个非常庞大的基础设施来监督，你知道，你不能把一个外来者带进来，然后直接让他们接管一切。这是一个非常困难的过渡，那时事情就会崩溃，人们会偷东西，呃，事情会被关闭。那么，你如何在不通过引入外部新人而破坏社会核心功能的情况下维持社会的核心功能呢？这就是事情变得非常混乱的地方。所以，我不知道未来会怎样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Freeberg**: I mean, I think it's inevitable that there's a break in the country because of the effect of sanctions. The average income is about 200 bucks a month in Iran. And the price of food is roughly the same as the US, maybe a little bit less than the US. I mean, there a combo meal at McDonald's, I just pulled this up in Tan is four bucks equivalent. So again, if you're making $200 a month and it's four bucks to go to McDonald's, costs catch up pretty quickly. I think that ultimately is what breaks civil society is when people can't afford the things that they need and people have no choice but to stand up. and an oppressive system, an oppressive regime can keep people down for so long until they're starving or they can't get access to things like medical care. And these are the sorts of things that ultimately lead to these moments. So, it seems like it's an inevitability. The United States put a lot of pressure on the regime in Iran and it seems to be starting to break. The key question that everyone's asking is Trump going to act in supporting the revolution which theoretically I would imagine would involve attacking IRGC sites which are the revolutionary guard that are sort of the internal security force that maintains the regime's control over the people and if they take out IRGC sites will that actually result in the people being free and what's the transition plan? This is obviously a very messy situation. Reza Palavi is in Europe and he said he's ready to come back and he is the Sha's son and if he comes back how are you going to give him influence and control? This is the same question that recently came up in Venezuela. There is a very large infrastructure that needs to be overseen of government agencies and you know you can't bring an outsider in and just plug them right in to take over everything. It's a very difficult transition and that's when things fall apart when people steal stuff when uh things get turned off. So how do you maintain kind of the core functioning of society without breaking it by bringing someone new from the outside? That's where this gets very messy. So I I don't know what's ahead.

</details>

**Jason**: 是的。昨晚没有发生罢工。**Bessant**宣布了一些增加的**经济制裁**。这似乎总是处理这种情况的最佳方式之一，就是增加经济压力，正如你指出的，**Freeberg**。对于不熟悉的人来说，**伊朗**是一个大国。我记得它是中东第二大国，仅次于埃及，大约有近1亿人口，我想有9500万人居住在**伊朗**。呃，如果这里发生**政权更迭**，这将对该地区产生巨大影响。显然，你听说过**胡塞武装**和**真主党**在**伊朗**得到支持、资助和庇护。所以，如果发生这种情况，即使只有10%到30%的几率，那也将是相当戏剧性的，是吗？你对这可能意味着什么有什么想法？你知道，我们一直在关注中东的现代化，以及**沙特**、**阿联酋**、**卡塔尔**等所有国家都在谈判桌上占有一席之地，影响力不断增加，这些国家的现代化程度不断提高。这会对该地区产生什么影响？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Yeah. And the strikes didn't happen last night. Bessant announced some increased sanctions. That always seems to be one of the best ways to handle this is to increase the economic pressure as you pointed out Freeberg and for people who don't who are not familiar Iran is a large country. It's the second largest in the Middle East behind Egypt I believe and close to 100 million people 95 million people I think live in Iran. Uh this would have a dramatic impact on the region if there was a transition here. Obviously, you've heard about uh different Houthis and Hezbollah being supported, funded, housed in Iran. So, this would be quite dramatic, huh? If this turned over, uh even if it's a 10 to 30% chance this were to happen, any thoughts on what that would mean? You know, we've been watching this modernization of the Middle East and just Saudi, UAE, Qatar, everybody having a seat at the table, increasing influence, increasing modernization in those countries. What would this do in the region?

</details>

**Chamath**: 很难说。这是一个充满活力的民族。如果你看看**伊朗**侨民，他们真的是他们所加入的每一种文化中充满活力的组成部分。如果你认识洛杉矶的波斯人，或者波斯人，我的意思是，他们……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: It's really hard to tell. It's an incredibly vibrant people. If you look at the Iranian diaspora, they're really a dynamic part of every culture they join. If you know Persians in LA or Persians, I mean, they're

</details>

**Jason**: 我的意思是，你和我在洛杉矶和侨民打过扑克。这些是**Westwood**最棒的人。他们是最棒的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: I mean, you and I played poker with the diaspora in LA. These are the most people in Westwood. They're they're the greatest.

</details>

**Chamath**: 他们是最棒的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: They're the greatest people.

</details>

**Jason**: 他们把俱乐部关了。游戏里最后离开的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: They're shutting the club down. The last people out at the game.

</details>

**Chamath**: 是的。他们真的很棒。我想说的是，我认为你不能在这里用一概而论的方式来描绘中东。它与中东其他国家有着非常不同的文化。它有着根本不同的宗教。它有着根本不同的语言。所以，我只想说，我不知道**伊朗**到底发生了什么。有太多的**信息封锁**，所以我采纳了**Sax**的观点，我认为现在美国唯一对情况有准确了解的人，可能是美国的军事和情报机构，而我们其他人都在对小块信息反应不足或反应过度，而没有真正了解整体的背景和全貌。在突发新闻环境中，最好做一些研究，呃，是的，对你的立场要谦逊和深思熟虑。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: Yeah, they're really great. The thing that I would say is that I don't think that you can paint the Middle East with the broad brush here. It's a very different culture than the other Middle East countries. It's a fundamentally different religion. It's a fundamentally different language. So, I would just say that I don't know what's actually going on in Iran. There's been so much information containment that I take Sax's point of view which is I think the only people in the United States right now that have an accurate sense are probably the military and intelligence apparatus of the United States and the rest of us are underreacting or overreacting to small pieces of information without really knowing the context and the mosaic of the whole. In a breaking news environment, it's uh best to do some research and uh yeah, be humble and thoughtful by the way about your positions. Yeah.

</details>

**Freeberg**: 关于这件事最疯狂的是，如果你把目光从**伊朗**移开，就会发现**信息战**的游戏完全不同了。那么你有什么呢？你让**SpaceX**在**伊朗**启用了**星链**，然后试图利用这种机制获取信息，以填补空白。对吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Freeberg**: The crazy thing about this if you shift away from Iran was specifically the information warfare game is totally different. So what did you have? You had SpaceX enable Starlink over Iran and then there was the attempt to use that mechanism to get information out to fill in the mosaic. Right. So

</details>

**Chamath**: 90%发生的是什么？10%发生的是什么？有没有支持**Kmeni**的反革命？我们谁都不知道，因为你会看到这些片段，很难真正进行三角测量。然后整个信息通道被关闭了，出现了各种阻断机制，基本上把数据包丢失率降到了80-90%。重要的是要明白，这就是我们未来在每次冲突中都会看到的**信息战**的世代。特别是当你拥有像**星链**这样无处不在的东西以及天空中其他可以帮助你获取信息的东西时，你会看到这些策略不断增加。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: was what was happening 90%, was what was happening 10%. Was there counterrevolutions that were supportive of Kmeni? None of us knew anything cuz you would see these snippets and it was very hard to actually triangulate. Then you had this entire information channel get shut down and you had all kinds of blocking mechanisms that essentially drove the packet loss down to like 80 90%. And it's just important to understand that is the generation of warfare and information that we are going to see in every conflict going forward. Especially when you have something as ubiquitous as Starlink and other things in the sky to help you get the information out, you're just going to see these tactics increase.

</details>

**Jason**: 我不知道你们有没有看过。**Anthony Bourdain**，愿他安息，在2013年左右做了一期非常棒的《**未知之旅**》（**Parts Unknown**）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: And I don't know if you guys ever saw it. Anthony Bourdain, rest in peace, did a really great parts unknown in 2013 or

</details>

**All**: 我看过的**Anthony Bourdain**节目。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**All**: Anthony Bourdain I've ever watched.

</details>

**Jason**: 是的。如果你想看看**伊朗**，它看起来太棒了。看看**Anthony Bourdain**在德黑兰的《**未知之旅**》。它看起来像一个派对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Yeah. If you want to see Iran, it looks so amazing. Look at the Anthony Bourdain parts unknown in Tyrron. It looks like a party.

</details>

**Chamath**: 嗯，是的。那里的年轻人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: Well, yeah. And young people there.

</details>

**Jason**: 充满活力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Total vibe there.

</details>

**Chamath**: 是的。那里的年轻人真的在这种压迫下生活着，你真的会觉得他们和我们或世界上任何其他人没什么不同。而那些带他四处采访的记者后来被拘留了。我真的很尊重**Andy Berdane**，他甚至做了那集节目，伙计。他们冒了很大的风险。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: Yeah. The young people are like really living their life under this oppression and you you really get the sense that they're not much different than us or or any other folks in the world. And the the journalists who took him around were later detained. And I really respect Andy Berdane for even doing that episode, man. They took a lot of risk doing that.

</details>

**Saxs**: 记得有一段时间，**Instagram**上最受欢迎的账号之一是“德黑兰的富家子弟”吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: Remember there was a period where one of the most popular accounts on Instagram was the rich kids of Tyrron,

</details>

### 数据中心能源与电网升级

**Jason**: 好了。**微软**将自费建设**数据中心**。我们已经讨论**AI数据中心**的**能源需求**很长时间了。呃，一直以来都有一个主题：如果**数据中心**消耗所有这些能源，它将导致当地电力消耗飙升。我们看到一些**数据中心**项目，先生们，可能因为当地的反对而撤出。周一，**特朗普总统**，我们的**特朗普总统**在**Truth Social**上解决了这场公关危机，点名批评**微软**，说“绝不希望美国人因为**数据中心**而支付更高的电费。两个词，**数据中心**。”我加了最后一句。**微软**将从本周开始做出重大改变，以确保美国人不会为他们的电力消耗买单。**微软**总裁**Brad Smith**宣布，他们将在建设**数据中心**的地方支付更高的电费，以覆盖新发电和**电网升级**的成本。这似乎是一个非常简单的想法。他们还将支付费用来补充从水库中抽取的水。这个问题也被夸大了一点。**Freeberg**，你可能，或者实际上明天，你可能对此了解很多，你可以解释一下**数据中心**水循环问题和误解。**微软**还宣布他们不会接受任何税收减免或电费折扣。所以那个时代似乎已经结束了。**Chamath**，你参与了许多**数据中心**项目，显然**David Sachs**也参与了，**AIS**也是。还有公务员。所以，**Chamath**，你先开始吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: All right. Microsoft is going to pay its own way on data centers. We've been talking about this um you know energy needs for AI data centers for a long time now and uh there's been this theme hey if the data centers are going to take all this energy it's going to spike local power consumption we saw a number of data centers gentlemen maybe pull out of projects where there was local push back on them on Monday President Trump our President Trump addressed this PR crisis on truth social calling out Microsoft and never want Americans to pay higher electricity bills because of data centers. Two words, data centers. I added the last part. Microsoft will make major changes beginning this week to ensure that Americans don't pick up the tab for their power consumption. Microsoft President Brad Smith announced they will pay higher electricity rates where they are building data centers to cover the cost of the new power generation and grid upgrades. Seems like a pretty simple idea. And they're also going to pay to replenish water that it draws from the reservoirs. That issue has also been a little bit overblown. Freeberg, you probably or actually tomorrow, you probably know a lot about that and you can explain the data center recycling water issues and the misperceptions. And they're not Microsoft has announced they're not going to accept any tax breaks or electricity rate discounts. So that era seems to have ended. Chop, you're involved in a number of data centers and obviously David Sachs, you're involved in this as are AIS are. and civil servants. So, Shabbath, why don't you start us off here?

**Chamath**: 你们可以找到那个片段，但我们几周前谈过这类事情即将发生。我真的很喜欢它。这是一套非常好的首要措施，即进入一个当地区域，并解决所有这些能源问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: You guys can find the clip, but we talked about this a few weeks ago that these kinds of things were in the offing. I really like it. It's a very good first order set of things to do, which is to step into a local area and take all of these energy issues off the table,

</details>

**Jason**: 至少在你贡献的范围内。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: at least to the extent that you're contributing to it.

</details>

**Chamath**: 问题在于**数据中心**只是问题的一部分。现实是，我们有一种全新的生活方式，正在消耗越来越多的电子。我们所需要的电力正处于短缺状态。公用事业公司的反应是现在开始建设，这是正确的反应。问题是，在过去的20年里，他们一直在建设不足。所以，当他们赶上来时，即使有**数据中心**愿意支付他们的公平份额，电费仍然会上涨。那么，除了**微软**刚刚宣布的措施之外，我们还需要做什么？我认为所有超大规模公司都应该效仿**微软**的做法。我认为总统能够让这些人坐下来达成协议是很棒的。下一个主要的事情是什么？下一个主要的事情是，当你真正创建一个1000亿或2000亿美元的**税收股权**工具，并让他们完全补贴和支付房主的电费。你如何做到这一点？你通过支付他们安装**太阳能**和**储能**的费用来做到这一点。他们为什么要这样做？他们这样做有两个原因。第一，也是最重要的，这将赋予他们在全国范围内运营的**社会许可**。第二个原因是，总统在一个“大而美丽”的法案中保留了进行这类投资并获得**税收优惠**的能力。所以，如果你把这两件事结合起来，我认为第一步是，你进入一个当地区域，告诉当地居民，我们会支付水费，我们会确保噪音最小化，我们会确保我们绝不打折。我们支付我们的公平份额，即使这意味着比你支付的电费更多。这是第一步。但现在我认为我们需要进入第二步。这里有一大笔我们已经分配的资金，用于为你的房子安装**太阳能**、**储能**、下一代**热泵**，以及一套现代化的基础设施，这样你就完全具有弹性，现在你对电网如何应对所有即将到来的需求完全无动于衷。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: The problem is that the data centers are only part of the problem. The reality is that we have a whole new way of living that is drawing more and more electrons. We are at a shortage for what we need. The reaction of the utilities is to now build which is the right reaction. The problem is that for the last 20 years they've been underbuilding. So as they catch up, even if you have the data centers that are willing to pay their fair share, rates will still go up. So what do we need to do that is beyond what Microsoft just announced? I think all the hyperscalers should copy what Microsoft did. I think it's great that the president was able to get these guys to the table to agree to it. What is the next major thing? The next major thing is when you actually create a hundred or $200 billion tax equity vehicle and you have them completely subsidize and pay for the electricity costs of homeowners. How do you do that? You do that by paying for them to get solar and storage. Why would they do that? They would do that for two reasons. Number one, and the most important is that it will give them a social license to operate throughout the country. The second reason is that the president preserved the ability to make those kinds of investments and be tax advantaged for doing it in the one big beautiful bill. So if you put these two things together, I think step one is you go into a local area, you tell the local residents, we'll pay for the water, we'll make sure there's minimal noise, and we'll make sure that we take absolutely no discount. we pay our fair share even if it means paying more than you do for electricity. That's step one. But now I think we need to go in with step two. Here is a bunch of money that we have allocated to go and fit your house out with solar, with storage, with next generation heat pumps, with a modern set of infrastructure so that you are totally resilient and now you are completely ambivalent to what the grid has to do in reaction to all the demand that's coming.

</details>

**Jason**: 是的。我大约一年前在“本周创业公司”节目中采访过**Base Power**的**Zack Dell**，我们当时就在谈论这个。我说：“嘿，为什么不……？”他们做的是电池，而不是**太阳能**，因为**太阳能**需要时间，你得拆掉屋顶，**太阳能**有一些复杂性，你需要有空间，安装成本很高。他们只是在你房子外面放一个像**R2-D2**小管子一样的电池，当能源便宜充足的时候，他们就充满电池，当能源昂贵且电网面临挑战的时候，他们就部署它。他说那些交易正在进行中，或者说讨论正在发生，那是在很久以前了。所以这是一个非常容易实现的双赢局面。**Chamath**，你描述的，**Sachs**，这感觉就像是现在积极主动、深思熟虑地向民众传达：“嘿，**AI**热潮来了，你们有顾虑，我们会提前解决。”那么你参与过这些讨论吗？你是否在和**Chris Wright**谈论沟通方面的重叠，还是这只是一个自由市场解决方案？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Yeah. I had um Zack Dell from uh base power on this week in startups I don't know a year ago now and we were talking about this and I said hey why wh why why wouldn't you just and and what they do is not solar because solar takes time you got to rip up your roof there there's some complications with solar you need to have the space for it it's expensive to install they just put a battery like a little R2-D2 tube outside your house they fill up that battery when energy is cheap and plentiful and they deploy it when it's expensive and the grid has challenges and he said those kind of deals are in the works or the discussions were happening and that was back then. So this is a really easy win-win type situation. Shimath you're describing Sachs this feels like proactive now thoughtful ways to communicate to the populace of hey the AI boom is here and you have concerns we're going to get ahead of them. So have you been involved in any of these discussions? Is are you talking with Chris Wright and like overlapping in terms of the um communication here or is it just a free market solution?

</details>

**Saxs**: 嗯，**Jason**，总统从执政之初就一直在这个问题上走在前列。我不知道你是否记得，他说他将把**AI**公司变成最大的电力公司，因为他明白他们所需的**数据中心**需要大量的电力，但他们将建立自己的发电设施，而不仅仅是从电网取电。所以，我认为这种理解一直存在。当我与超大规模公司交谈时，他们也告诉我，他们的计划不是从电网取电。他们基本上是在电表后面建立自己的发电设施。这被称为**协同定位**。事实上，我认为最终这将为住宅消费者降低电费，原因有二。一是当**数据中心**自己发电时，他们可以在连接电网时将电力回售或捐赠给电网。他们不必连接电网，但一旦连接，他们就可以捐赠电力。其次，发电存在许多**固定成本**。它不仅仅是可变的，对吧？存在这些巨大的**固定成本**。因此，随着规模的增加，这些**固定成本**会分摊到更多的供应量上。这会降低可变费率，基本上是每个人的计量费率。所以，规模是好的。我认为像**Bernie Sanders**这样的人对这里的批评具有欺骗性，他们说的是“我们必须完全关闭所有**数据中心**”，而真正的问题是，他和像他这样的人对发电进行了过度监管，以至于建立新的发电设施变得太困难了。对吧？我的意思是，如果发电更容易，就不需要限制**数据中心**可以使用多少电力。他们可以直接自己发电。所以，这才是显而易见的解决方案，很高兴看到**微软**做出这一承诺并将其正式化。我认为所有其他超大规模公司都会这样做。再次强调，我认为他们从未计划从电网获取电力来满足他们的电力需求。他们一直都明白，他们必须建立自己的发电设施。而问题仅仅是法规阻碍了这一切。最后一点是，例如，**FK**（**联邦能源管理委员会**）有许多法规干扰了**协同定位**的能力。**协同定位**是指将**数据中心**和发电设施放在一起，或者同时进行。能源部长**Chris Wright**已指示**FK**进行一系列改革，使电表后面发电和**协同定位**更容易，以便这些**数据中心**可以建立自己的发电设施。而唯一没有发生的原因仅仅是通常的官僚延误。但这正在顺利进行中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: Well, Jason, the the president's been ahead of the curve on this issue really since the beginning of the administration. I don't know if you recall, but he said that he was going to make AI companies into the biggest power companies because he understood that the data centers that they needed required a lot of power, but they were going to stand up their own power generation and they wouldn't just draw off the grid. And so, I think this understanding has always been there. When I've talked to the hyperscalers, they also tell me that their plan is not to draw from the grid. It's to basically set up their own power generation behind the meter. It's called collocation. And in fact, I think ultimately this will bring down rates for residential consumers for two reasons. One is that when the data centers create their own power, they can sell back or donate back to the grid when they connect. They don't have to connect to the grid, but once they do, they can donate back. And then second, there's a number of fixed costs in power generation. It's not just variable, right? There's these large fixed costs. And so as you increase scale, those fixed costs get amvertised over a greater amount of supply. And that brings down the variable rate, basically the the metered rate for everybody. So scale is good. And I think the deceptive nature of the criticism here by like Bernie Sanders and people like that is what they say is well we just have to shut down all the data centers period when the real problem here is that he and others like him have overregulated power generation to death so that it's too hard to set up net new power. Right? I mean if power generation were easier there wouldn't need to be a limit on what the data centers could use. They could just bring their own power. So that is the obvious solution here and it's good to see Microsoft make this pledge and sort of formalize that. I think all the other hyperscalers will do that. Again, it was never part of their plan, I think, to draw on the grid for their power needs. They always, I think, understood that they'd have to stand up their own power. And the issue is just regulations getting in the way of that. And just one final point on this is that there are a bunch of regulations by FK for example that interfere with the ability to do collocation. Collocation is when you put a data center and the power generation next to each other or you do them together. And Chris Wright, the secretary of energy has directed FK to make a bunch of changes to make behind the meter and collocation easier so that these data centers can stand up their own power. And the only reason that hasn't happened is just because of the usual bureaucratic delays. But that is well on its way to happening.

**Saxs**: 这说得通吗？

**Saxs**: Does that make sense?

**Jason**: 是的，完全说得通。你知道，如果我们开始考虑激励措施，激励措施显然很重要。我想很多人不知道这一点，但我认为我们在谈论法国核能的时候也提到过。住在**Avine**（艾维尼）反应堆附近的人，我记得是这样发音的，他们支付0.1%的税，而地区平均水平是12%。所以他们，然后我认为英国也谈到了某种“危险区”或提议和支付。你可以给人们折扣来激励他们，奖励他们，给他们免费的当地电力等等，让他们住在核电站附近。这在美国还没有出现，而且**Freeberg**，围绕这些**数据中心**有很多**FUD**（恐惧、不确定和怀疑）。人们抛出了很多论点。我想你和我在私下讨论过关于用水量的误解，以及这些**数据中心**的用水量大部分是循环利用的。嗯，如果你知道这一点，你愿意向听众解释一下这方面的数据吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Yeah, it makes total sense. And you know, if we start thinking about incentives, incentives obviously matter. And I don't think a lot of people know this, but and I think I talked about it when we were talking about nuclear freeird in France. the people who live near the Avine uh I think is how it's pronounced uh reactor they pay 0.1% tax versus the 12% regional average and so they and then I think the UK has also talked about the sort of danger zone or uh proposals and payments you can give people a discount to incentivize them and reward them giving them free local electricity etc for living near a nuclear power plant that hasn't come up here in the United States and there's been a lot of of FUD, fear, uncertainty, and doubt Freeberg around these data centers. People throwing around a lot of talking points. I think you and I discussed offline the the misperceptions about water usage and that the water usage is largely recycled in these data centers. Um, if you know about that, would you would you inform the audience about that piece of data?

</details>

**Freeberg**: 嗯，我们有很多水。它只是循环利用，所以我不认为那是个问题。呃，但是清洁水以及当地居民清洁水成本的增加是那里的误解。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Freeberg**: Well, we got a lot of water. It just goes around in a circle, so I don't think that's an issue. uh but clean water and the cost of clean water increasing for a local population is the misperception there.

</details>

**Saxs**: 这些**数据中心**的现代冷却系统，水会循环并把热量排出**数据中心**。所以水不会被用完。我想有一种单独的蒸发冷却方式确实会消耗一些水，但现代**数据中心**不使用那种方式。所以，水的问题完全是个骗局，它实际上是这个更大的可负担性问题的一个次级骗局。我不是说可负担性不是问题，但它是**拜登**9%**通货膨胀**造成的，现在民主党人正试图把它变成一个问题。当谈到**数据中心**的电力时，再次强调，这都归结于法规使得产生新的电力变得太困难。所以，再次强调，需求本身的扩大不是问题，如果你也扩大电力供应。事实上，它会降低每个人的价格，因为规模会产生**规模经济**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: The modern cooling systems these data centers the water recirculates and transports the heat out of the data center. So it's not like the water is used up. I guess there's a separate type of evaporative cooling that does use up some water, but modern data centers don't use that. So, the water issue is really a a total hoax, and it's really kind of a subhoax of this larger affordability issue. I'm not saying that affordability isn't an issue, but it was caused by Biden's 9% inflation, and now Democrats are trying to make it an issue. When it comes to the power for data centers, again, this all comes back to the fact that the regulations make it too hard to generate net new power. So again, scaling demand on its own not a problem if you also scale supply of electricity. In fact, it brings down prices for everyone because scale creates economies of scale.

</details>

**Jason**: 是的。其中90%的水被重复利用，而且有封闭的水循环系统。

**Chamath**: 这是我的提议。我认为总统应该尝试创建一个3000亿、4000亿、5000亿美元的**税收股权**基金，并帮助消除5000万到1亿美国家庭的电费。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: here's my pitch. I think the president should try to create a three, four, 500 billion dollar tax equity fund and help eliminate the electricity costs of 50 to 100 million American households.

</details>

**Jason**: 太棒了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Amazing.

</details>

**Chamath**: 嗯，这是，让我给你算一下。所以，我们国家每年消耗大约4万亿千瓦时的电力。平均价格是每千瓦时18美分。所以每年大约花费7500亿美元在电力上。其中三分之一，2500亿美元是住宅消费。其中三分之二，5000亿美元是工业和商业消费。理论上，你可以将工业和商业消费的价格提高大约50%。并使美国所有住宅用电免费。如果你是住宅用户，你每月会有一个免费用电上限。如果你超过这个上限，你会被收费。但低于这个上限，你是免费的，根据你房子的面积，我不知道，随便什么。然后在商业和工业方面，你会有动力去建立私人电力系统，因为你可以降低成本。与其将所有这些集中在公用事业公司，它能做的是，它可以迫使工业和商业用户建立自己的电力系统，这将增加美国的整体电力供应。**数据中心**只是冰山一角。但如果你把这变成一个全行业的普遍问题，那么所有工业公司都将不得不走这条路。问题是，它并没有改变净消费模式。如果你真的为每1500万户家庭安装**太阳能**和**储能**，你就可以从电网中减少1万亿瓦时的需求。那是你不需要额外建设的1万亿瓦时，但你无法那么快地建设。所以，我喜欢**太阳能**和**储能**的原因是，你让这些人变得如此自给自足。现在，突然之间，我们实际上比以前更快地赶上中国。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: Well, here's the let me let me give you the math. So, we consume in this country about 4 trillion kilowatt hours of electricity. Average price is 18 cents a kilowatt hour. So it's about call it $750 billion of spend on electricity every year. Onethird of that 250 billion is residential consumption. 2/3 of that 500 billion is industrial and commercial consumption. Theoretically you could increase the price on industrial and commercial consumption by call it 50%. And make all residential electricity in the United States free. If you're a residential user, you get a cap of free electricity every month. And if you use more than that cap, you get charged. But below that cap, you're free based on whatever square footage of your house, I don't know, whatever. And then on the commercial and industrial side, the reason you would then have an incentive to build private power systems would be that you can bring your cost down. And instead of centralizing all of this with the utilities, what it can do is it can force a market demand for industrial and commercial users to build their own power systems, which would increase overall electricity supply in the United States. The data centers are the tip of the iceberg. But if you make this a panindustrial problem, then all of the industrial companies would have to take this path. The problem is it doesn't change the net consumption model. If you actually go to solar and storage for every 15 million homes, you take a terowatt hour of demand off the grid. That's an extra terowatt hour that you don't need to build, but you can't build that quickly. So, the reason why I like solar and storage is you make these folks so self-reliant. Now, all of a sudden, we're actually catching up to China faster than we would have otherwise.

**Jason**: 伙计们，你们在互相插话。**Chamath**的观点是，你仍然在对电网征税。他的提议在你所说的基础上增加了一层。所以他同意你的观点，**Freeberg**。嘿，是的，让企业多付一点钱，而不是，或者让他们脱离电网以减少电网负荷。嗯，美国有8000万独立住宅，安装像**Base Power**正在做的这种电池组大约需要1.5万美元。你可能可以把它降到1万美元。如果你只是做个粗略的计算，你谈论的是一万亿美元。所以基本上，用1000亿美元，你可以覆盖全国10%的家庭。如果你在一段时间内这样做，我想**Chamath**的观点是，我们就不必再担心电网了。你可以用电池来做。你可以用**太阳能**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: guys you're talking through each other. Chimat's point is that you're still taxing the grid. His proposal adds another layer to what you're saying. So he's in agreement with you, Freeberg. Hey, yeah, let's have the businesses pay a little extra and and not or and let's have them take off the grid to reduce the grid. Well, there's 80 million freestanding homes in the United States and it's about 15k to put these battery packs in like base power zooing. You can probably get it down to 10. And if you just do back back of the envelope math, you're talking about a trillion dollars. So basically for a hundred billion, you could do 10% of the country. If you were to do that over some time period, we would have we would stop worrying about the grid, I think, is Chimoth's point. And you could do it with battery. You could do solar.

</details>

**Chamath**: 嗯，你不会停止担心电网。但是**Jason**，只是为了完善你所说的，因为你的方向非常正确。消费者会更少感受到这些问题。我们所有人不必再担心如何承保万亿瓦时以赶上中国，我们实际上可以一举两得。消费者家庭不再有这种焦虑。他们不必支付账单。而且因为他们自己发电，他们脱离了电网。现在这意味着额外的万亿瓦时实际上可以用于商业和工业应用，包括这些**数据中心**。你说的没错，**Freeberg**，我们应该提高他们的关税。我只是认为这要复杂得多，也昂贵得多，不能要求每个人都更复杂。好吧，听着。这一切都不是免费的。都不是免费的。然而，我们有这样一个**AI**带来的绝佳机会，这样做是很有意义的。我认为这就是大局。**AI**是一个巨大的机会。投入了这么多。问题是，你为什么不做呢？如果我们想生活在富足的时代，如果我们想提升国家底层一半的人口，如果我们想要负担得起，人们把钱花在哪里？食物、杂货、房租、电费和公用事业费。所以，如果我们想找到一种直接的方法来做到这一点，对于所有关心环境和清洁能源的嬉皮士来说，这也是一个胜利。而且它不会从美国人的口袋和他们的税收中出来。它来自正在印钞的公司。如果你想谈论财富再分配，这是美国大公司回馈美国人的一种方式。你大约三四个月前谈过这个，对吧，说：“嘿，也许会有一些方法让大公司为美国人做一些伟大的事情。”美国人不必过多考虑他们的水费，这是一种**善举**。现在，如果他们不必考虑电费，哇，那太棒了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: Well, you would not stop worrying about the grid. But Jason, just to refine what you're saying because you're directionally very right. The consumers would feel less of these issues. And instead of all of us worrying how to underwrite terowatt hours to catch up to China, we actually get a two for one. The consumer homes don't have that anxiety anymore. They don't have the bill. And because they're generating their own power, they're off the grid. And now what that means is that extra terowatt hour can actually go to the commercial and industrial applications including these data centers. And you're right, Freeberg, we should raise their tariffs. I just think it's a lot it's a lot more complicated and a lot more expensive to ask everyone more complicated. Okay, listen. None of this is free. None of it's free. However, we have such an amazing opportunity with AI that it makes sense to do this. That I think is the big picture. AI is such a huge opportunity. There's so much invested. Why wouldn't you do this is the question. And if we're want to live in the age of abundance and we want to bring the bottom half of the country up and we want affordability, where do people spend their money? food, groceries, their rent, and their electricity and the utilities. So, we if we want to figure out a direct way to do this, and for all the hippie- dippies who care about the environment and clean energy, this is a win there as well. And it doesn't come out of Americans pockets and their taxes. It comes out of corporations which are printing money. If you want to talk about redistribution of wealth, this is a way for the great American max corporations to give something back to Americans. And you talked about this, right, off maybe three or four weeks ago that hey, maybe there would be some way for great corporations to do great things for Americans. The fact that Americans don't think about their water bill that much is a is a mitzvah. It's a great thing. Now, if they didn't have to think about electricity, wow, amazing.

**Chamath**: 像登月计划一样的框架，说如果我们能让美国所有住宅用电免费呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: mission to the moon style framing to say what if we could make all residential electricity free in the United States

</details>

**Freeberg**: 而且在未来十年，如果我们能做到这一点，我们不仅能帮助美国人省钱，还能在美国能源生产中实现分布式投资计划，并迫使企业承担责任，而不是集中化。所以我只是喜欢这种将整个事情免费化的框架，将美国住宅用电免费化作为一项核心福利。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Freeberg**: and over the next decade if we can do that not only do we help Americans with their wallet but we actually can enable a distributed investment scheme in American energy production and we force the corporations to step up and do their part rather than centralize it. So I I just like the framing of making this whole thing free, making residential electricity free in the US as a core benefit.

</details>

**Chamath**: 另一件事是，我们之前已经讨论过几次了。我认为最大的资金短缺，目前尚不清楚何时能实现，将发生在这些公用事业公司身上。因为如果我们刚刚讨论的任何版本发生，突然间你有了自己的公用事业公司，然后**Freeberg**的工商业用户也有了自己的电力公用事业公司，那么公用事业公司该怎么办？所有这些资本支出都去哪儿了？他们如何偿还债券？他们的费率基础会发生什么？这是一个巨大的经济问题，我认为如果我们刚刚讨论的哪怕一小部分成为现实，这个问题就会出现。

**Chamath**: The other thing is we've talked about this, I've mentioned this a couple times before. I think the single biggest dollar short, it's not clear when that one will be able to make will be on these utilities. Because if any version of what we just talked about happens and all of a sudden you have private homeowners that are their own utility and then Freeberg CNI being their own power utility, what do the utilities do? What does all this capex go to? How do they pay back their bonds? What happens to their rate base? This is a huge economic question that I think will come up if even a small modeicum of what we just talked about materializes.

### OpenAI与Cerebras的计算能力交易

**Jason**: 好的，**OpenAI**又达成了一项**计算能力**交易。这项交易价值超过100亿美元。**OpenAI**正在从**Cerebras**购买**计算能力**。**Cerebras**，拼写是C E R E B R A S。他们承诺在三年内购买高达750兆瓦的电力。**Cerebras**像**Grock**一样，生产用于**AI推理**的专用芯片。据报道，**Cerebras**正在洽谈以220亿美元的估值融资10亿美元，预计今年可能在未来几个月内进行IPO。**Sam Altman**是该公司的投资者。所以，呃，他很了解它，而且……

Cerebras is in talks to raise 1 billion at a $22 billion valuation according to reports and they're expected to IPO this year potentially in the next couple of months. Sam Waltman's an investor in the company. So, uh he knows it well and

**Saxs**: These were your competitors at Grock. Yeah. Uh Chima,

</details>

**Chamath**: 他们是同时代的人。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: they were contemporaries. Yeah.

</details>

**Chamath**: 他们很棒。我们都同时起步，我们采用了略微不同的技术方法。**Cerebras**从一开始就说的最大区别，这是我的朋友**Andrew Feldman**，所以我要向他致敬。他非常聪明。如果你看到一个芯片，你实际上看到的是一个晶圆。一个晶圆上充满了小芯片，对吧？你真的把它们撕下来。这就是它们被称为芯片的原因。**Andrew**说：“不，我只做一个巨大的芯片，晶圆那么大。”所以如果你看看它，**Nick**，也许你能找到一张它的照片。这些东西非常大。当时，人们觉得，他们似乎没有真正理解**Cerebras**正在构建的以及**Andrew**正在构建的力量。然后第一批真正加入的人是阿联酋人，也就是**MGX**和**G42**。然后你开始运行这些模型。你开始看到的是，天哪，他们的**推理**速度快得惊人。再次回到我们上周谈论的，因为当你把计算和内存放在同一个地方时，物理距离被最小化，复杂性也被最小化了。所以，你只是拥有令人难以置信的速度。我能告诉你的是，**OpenAI**正在积极尝试多元化，以便他们拥有多种可用的**推理**路径。他们与**AMD**有大笔交易。他们与**Nvidia**有大笔交易。他们现在与**Cerebras**有大笔交易。如果你沿着这些线索看，我的信念是**硅**将迎来**复兴**。年轻的小团队构建解码**硅**，在未来10到20年内可以赚大钱。这是一个巨大的机会。这将像PC战争一样，**戴尔**对**康柏**对所有这些公司。这非常令人兴奋。祝贺**Cerebras**。他们应得的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: They're fantastic. We both started at the same time, we took slightly different technical approaches. The big difference that what Cerebra said initially from the start, and this is my friend Andrew Feldman, so I'll give him a shout out. Very smart guy. If you see a chip, what you actually see is a wafer. And a wafer is full of little chips, right? and you you literally tear them off. That's why they're called chips. Andrew was like, "No, I'm just going to make one ginormous chip the size of a wafer." And so if you look at it, Nick, maybe you can find a picture of it. These things are huge. And at the time, people were like, I don't think they really understood what the power of what Cerebras was building and what Andrew was building. And then the first folks that really got on board were the Emirates, so MGX and G42. And you started to run these models. And what you started to see was, man, their inference is blazing fast. Again, back to what we talked about last week because when you have the compute and the memory in the same place, physical distances are now minimized and the complexity is minimized. So, you just have incredible speed. What I can tell you is that OpenAI is aggressively trying to diversify so that they have multiple paths of inference available. They have a huge deal with AMD. They have a huge deal with Nvidia. They now have a huge deal with Cerebras. If you look at the trail of breadcrumbs, my belief there's going to be a renaissance in silicon. Young small teams building decode silicon can make a fortune over the next 10 to 20 years. It's a huge opportunity. It's going to be like the PC wars, Dell versus Compact versus all of these companies. It's super exciting. And congrats to Cerebras. They deserve it.

**Freeberg**: 计算需求有没有可能在某种程度上趋于平稳？我们已经建立了如此多的容量，软件也会变得更好。有人说**Anthropic**的资源受限，作为**OpenAI**的竞争对手，我认为精英**AI**用户普遍认为**Claude**现在比**OpenAI**的产品好得多，模型更好，应用也更好，但他们是用更少的资源做到的。那么，这种建设速度会放缓吗？这是一种可能出现的情况，还是未来五到十年会一直向上发展？你的水晶球怎么说？**Saxs**，你还在吗？

<details>

**Freeberg**: Is there um any argument that compute needs will level off in some way? will have built so much capacity and the software will get better. There's been some talk about anthropic being resource constrained as the contemporary to open AAI and I think there's pretty much uniformity amongst elite AI users that claude is a much better product now than OpenAI and the models are better, the applications are better but they're doing it with less. So could the buildout be could it slow down? Is that a scenario that's out there or is this always going to be up and to the right for the next five ten years? What's your crystal ball saying?

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Freeberg**: What are the 10 states that constitutionally ban asset taxes?

</details>

**Saxs**: 是的。所以，在这些州的宪法中，或者他们有宪法修正案，直接或隐含地规定你不能征收**财富税**或**资产税**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: Yeah. So, it's direct and implicit in those states constitutions or they have an amendment to the constitution that makes it um direct or implicit that you can't do a wealth tax or an asset section.

</details>

**Freeberg**: 它们是哪些州？**阿拉斯加**、**佛罗里达**、**内华达**、**新罕布什尔**、**南达科他**、**田纳西**、**德克萨斯**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Freeberg**: Which are they? Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas.

</details>

**Saxs**: 根据**Grock**的说法，只有**德克萨斯州**明确禁止**财富税**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: According to Grock, only Texas explicitly bans wealth taxes.

</details>

**Freeberg**: 是的，那是对的。但由于其他一些州的宪法，它是隐含的。所以**德克萨斯州**的宪法禁止“对财富或净资产征税”。**华盛顿州**有一个统一条款，将收入视为财产，禁止非统一税率。**佛罗里达州**的宪法禁止任何形式的个人税。**宾夕法尼亚州**有一个严格的统一条款，这将使得不可能有累进税率或对不同人群区分税率。**伊利诺伊州**有一个严格的宪法规定，要求实行统一的非累进税率。所以你不能进行分离。嗯，然后**资产征用**被称为民事资产没收，这是一个独立的法律问题，但在**新墨西哥州**、**内布拉斯加州**和**北卡罗来纳州**等州，这意味着你不能被州政府实际拿走资产。所以有很多州会受到宪法保护，免受此害。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Freeberg**: Yes, that is correct. But because of some of the other state constitutions, it's implicit. So Texas has in their constitution an a prohibition on quote tax on wealth or net worth. Washington has a uniformity clause which treats income as property which bans non-uniform rates. Florida's constitution bans any sort of personal tax. Pennsylvania has a strict uniformity clause which would make it impossible to have graduated tax rates or distinguished tax rates amongst populations. Illinois has a strict constitutional mandate for a flat non-graduated tax rate. So you cannot do uh a separation. Um and then asset seizure is referred to as a civil asset forfeite which is a separate legal issue but implies in states like New Mexico, Nebraska, and North Carolina, you cannot actually have an asset taken from you by the state. So there there's a bunch of states that this would be constitutionally protected against.

</details>

**Jason**: 所以你的观点没有改变。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: So nothing has changed in your perspective.

</details>

**Freeberg**: 我认为我们现在正在经历一个逐步觉醒的过程，那就是人们正在意识到**资产征用税**是对**私人财产权**的剥夺。这从根本上来说就是你所说的，我在我的推特中写道，**私人财产**现在变成了公共财产，因为一旦你通过立法投票赋予政府收取你的税后资产的权利，你基本上就是在说你不再拥有**私人财产**，因为在未来的任何时候，政府都可以投票说我要拿走你的**私人财产**，这与所得税不同，所得税是你赚取了以前没有的东西，他们从你的收入中抽取一定比例。现在的说法是，在你赚取收入之后，它现在是你的**私人财产**。他们可以来拿走它。所以这是一个在美国从未存在过的区别。我现在要反驳**房产税**，因为人们总是问我，**房产税**呢？**房产税**是对特定资产的服务费。收取的钱为该资产提供服务，使其更有价值。所以你得到了道路、基础设施、治安、消防、学校，所有这些伴随**房产税**而来的东西，使该资产更有价值，而且你随时可以选择出售该财产并停止支付**房产税**。你随时可以选择降级你的财产，购买更便宜的财产并支付更低的税。但是，这里还有另一个关于**房产税**的重要一点。它是统一的。统一意味着每个人在同一个县支付相同的百分比，相同的**房产税**率。这项正在提议的**资产征用税**是一种人口税，这意味着州或立法机关定义了一个特定的人群。在这种情况下，他们说的是任何净资产超过10亿美元的人，然后他们可以只从这个群体中征用资产。这是**非统一税收**。这意味着我们第一次说，根据一个人的**人口统计学**特征，也就是你想要用来定义那个人的任何东西，在这种情况下是他们的财富，你将受到不同的对待，这与所得税不同，因为记住，当你有累进所得税率，你说高收入者被征收更多税时，你征收的是收入，而不是个人。你不是通过查看个人来确定他们是否富有。你所做的只是查看独立的收入金额。所以统一条款是为了保护人们免受**人口统计学**歧视。你可能会不屑一顾，说：“哦，谁在乎亿万富翁？吃掉富人。”那太棒了。但从根本上说，你正在赋予政府、立法机关在未来采取他们想要的任何**人口统计学**定义，并从你那里征收他们想要的任何百分比的税后财产的能力。这就是为什么这如此令人不安。我们可以整天抱怨“吃掉富人”，显然这个群体是有偏见的，但普通民众应该非常清楚这样一个事实：一旦你赋予立法机关歧视一个群体并征收他们想要的任何百分比的能力。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Freeberg**: I think we're going through the rolling wakeup process right now, which is people are waking up to the fact that the asset seizure tax is an elimination of private property rights. that fundamentally what you're saying and I wrote this in my tweet that private property now becomes public property because as soon as you give the government the right to collect your post tax assets through a legislative vote, you are basically saying that you no longer have private property because at any point in the future the government can vote to say I'm going to take your private property which is different than an income tax which is when you earn something that you didn't have before and they take a percentage of your earnings of your income. The statement now is after you've made your income, it's now your private property. They can come and take it. And so that is a distinction that has never existed in the United States. And I will make the retort right now to property tax because people always say to me, what about property tax? A property tax is a service fee on a particular specific asset. The money that is collected provides services for that asset to make it more valuable. So you get roads, infrastructure, policing, fire, schools, all the stuff that comes with property tax, make that asset more, and you have the option at any point you want to sell that property and stop paying that property tax. You have the option at any point to downgrade your property and get a cheaper property and pay it lower. But and here's the other important point about property tax. It's uniform. Uniform means that everyone pays the same percentage, the same property tax rate in a county. This asset seizure tax that's being proposed is a demographic tax, meaning that the state or the legislature defines a specific group of individuals. In this case, they're saying anyone with a net worth over a billion dollars and then they can go and take assets from only that group. That is nonuniform taxation. It means that for the first time we're saying based on the demographics of a person meaning whatever you want to use to define that person in this case their wealth you are going to be treated differently and that is different than an income tax because remember when you have graduated income tax rates and you say high earners t get tax more what you're taxing is the earnings not the individual. You're not looking through to the individual to determine whether or not they're wealthy. All you're doing is looking at the independent earnings amount that's coming in. And so a uniformity clause is supposed to protect people from being demographically discriminated against. And you may roll your hand and be like, "Oh, who cares about the billionaires? Eat the rich." That's great. But fundamentally, you're giving the government, the legislature, the ability to in the future take any demographic definition they want and go in and take any percentage they want of after tax property from you. That is why this is so troubling. And we can harp all day long about eat the rich and obviously this group is is biased, but the general population should be very much aware of the fact that as soon as you give a legislature the ability to discriminate a group and take whatever% they want. Yeah.

So, let's take the first one of these. In terms of it getting on the ballot, you only need about 8 million bucks to collect the signatures. 850,000 signatures. It's not that many in California. There's definitely millions of people in California who would love to stick it to billionaires. So, they're going to gather the signatures that SEIU has the money. The only way that it wouldn't therefore make the ballot is if Gavin Newsome and the political machine bribe the SEIU with enough political benefits that they'll withdraw it. But what the SEIU is asking for is whatever it is, the $30 billion. And I don't know if Gavin Newsome has that much money laying around somewhere that he can just give them. Furthermore, if you're the guy running the SEIU, I understand his name is Dave Rean.

**Saxs**: you got to be looking at what's happening on X right now and you got to be gleeful. You got all these billionaires are panic tweeting all day long.

**Jason**: 不是整天。我早上在浴室里发推。

**Jason**: It's not all day long. I tweet in the morning from the bathroom.

**Saxs**: 嗯，我们都在做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: Well, we're all doing it.

</details>

**Jason**: 早上例行公事。我今天早上发了一大堆推文。所以如果你是**Rean**这个人，你会说：“哦，天哪，看看我有多大的影响力。”你知道，拧猪耳朵，看它尖叫。他拧了这些亿万富翁的耳朵，他们都在尖叫。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Morning constitutional. I went on a base tweeting spree this morning. So if you're if you're this guy Rean, you're like, "Oh my god, look how much leverage I've got." You know, twist a pig's ear, watch him squeal. He's twisted these billionaires ears, and they're all squealing.

</details>

**Saxs**: 那么你为什么不通过花费800万美元来增加你的影响力，把它放到投票中，然后进行谈判呢？

<details>

**Saxs**: So why wouldn't you increase your leverage by spending the $8 million, put it on the ballot, and then negotiate with

**Saxs**: 不，这只是一个表达。嘿，伙计，

**Jason**: 我不知道你的脑子里为什么会想到《**激流四勇士**》。

**Jason**: 你需要《**激流四勇士**》在脑子里。

**Jason**: You need that deliverance on the brain.

</details>

**Saxs**: 我也许需要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: I maybe I do.

</details>

**Chamath**: **Sax**，我告诉你为什么。所以，我显然一直相信，我一直相信长周期，我很久以前就说过。我们最终会陷入社会主义或某种法西斯主义。无论哪种方式，它都是一个暴政系统，将我们从我们已经陷入一段时间的死亡螺旋中解救出来。所以，这是真的。但是，我仍然想保留我的个人能动性。我确实认为，我们这些在**加利福尼亚州**真正关心的人应该保留一些能动性，而不是放弃我们对结果施加影响的能力。我认为我们需要公开诚实地谈论这会走向何方。让人们听到。让**加利福尼亚州**的人民决定。坦率地说，如果我们做好了我们的工作，我们大声疾呼，我们清楚地说明了**私人财产征用税**将把这个国家的每个人引向何方，以及这个国家**私人财产权**的删除，如果他们仍然接受，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: Sax, I'll tell you why. So, I've obviously been a believer I've been a believer in the long cycle and I've said this for a long time. We are going to end up in either a socialist or some sort of fascist. Either way, it's a tyrannical system to get us out of the death spiral that we've been in for some time. So, that is true. But, I still want to retain my sense of individual agency. And I do think that those of us who are in California who actually care should retain some sense of agency rather than suspend our um our ability to have an influence in the outcome here. I think we need to speak openly and honestly about where this leads to. Let people hear it. Let the people in California decide. And frankly, if we've done our job, we've spoken loudly, we've spoken clearly, we've re revealed to people where a private property seizure tax leads to for everyone in this country and the deletion of private property rights in this country and they still sign up to it,

</details>

**Chamath**: 那我就不玩了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: then I'm out.

</details>

**Jason**: 是的，我明白了。而且……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Yeah, I get it. And

</details>

**All**: 如果那是一个百亿富翁税，她早就退出了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**All**: if it was a centillionaire tax, she would have been out.

</details>

**Saxs**: 我同意我们应该反击。我不是宿命论者。我不认为结果是注定的，但我不明白为什么它不会进入投票，因为这与你和**BTA**反对者的说服力无关。这只是关于**SEIU**、**UHW**是否会花费必要的金额，800万、1000万、1200万，无论多少，来收集签名。我的意思是，我们听说他们有钱，对吧？那他们为什么不呢？这只会增加他们要求更多让步的筹码。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: I agree that we should fight it. I'm not being fatalistic. I don't think the outcome is predetermined, but I don't understand why it wouldn't get on the ballot because that that has nothing to do with how persuasive you and the opponents of BTA are. It's just about whether SEIU, UHW will spend the requisite amount of money, 8 million, 10 million, 12 million, whatever, to gather the signatures. And I mean, we've heard they have the money, right? So why wouldn't they? It only increases their leverage to demand more concessions.

</details>

**Jason**: 他们有1400万美元来收集签名，估计需要500万到1500万美元。所以，他们有足够的现金来收集签名。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: They have $14 million to gather the signatures, which the estimate was they'll need somewhere between five and 15. So, they have the cash they need to gather the signatures.

</details>

**Chamath**: 这是个好赌注。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: It's a good bet.

</details>

**Jason**: 而且他们有大约1000万美元来开展广告宣传。他们的估计是他们需要5000万到1亿美元来开展广告宣传。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: And they have roughly $10 million to run an ad campaign. And their estimate is they need between $50 and $100 million to run an ad campaign.

</details>

**Chamath**: 听起来不错，下一步他们会尝试让这件事通过。现在，民意调查数据显示，**Sachs**，还有影响的空间。所以，我确实认为，如果人们能够理解这会走向何方，而且，看，如果美国想接受这个，祝你好运，伙计，美国最终会陷入社会主义的死亡螺旋漏洞。祝你好运。玩得开心。我要去**Terminus**建立基金会。我不知道那到底在哪里，但我退出了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: Sounds like a good the next step will be that they'll try and get this thing signed up. Now, the polling data, it shows that there's room for influence sack. So, I do think that if people can understand where this is headed and look, if America wants to sign up to this, Godspeed, man, like that's where America's going to end up in the socialist death spiral loophole. Like, good luck. Have a good time. I'm going to Terminus to start the foundation. I don't know where the hell that is, but I'm out.

</details>

**All**: 你退出了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**All**: You're out.

**Chamath**: 我退出了。

**Saxs**: 同时，我们所能做的就是说出真相，努力揭示它，看看它会走向何方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: And in the meantime, all we can do is speak truth to it and try and shine light on it and see where it goes.

</details>

**Jason**: 嘿，也许是第51个州**格陵兰岛**。也许我们只做第一个州。

**Jason**: Hey, maybe 51st State Greenland. Maybe we'll just do the first state.

**Saxs**: 看，我不是说它会通过，尽管我确实认为一旦它进入投票，通过的可能性略大。我只是不明白为什么它不会进入投票。一旦它在，比如说，四月进入投票，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: Look, I'm not saying it's going to pass, although I do think it's probably slightly more likely than not to pass once it's on the ballot. I just don't understand why it's not going to be on the ballot. And once it makes the ballot in, let's say, April,

</details>

**Saxs**: 我认为会有一场大恐慌，人们会争相逃离，因为有很多人……

**Jason**: 我的理论是，我要打败公园的尽头。

**Jason**: who, you know, this is my theory is I'm going to beat the end of the park.

**Freeberg**: 人们没有意识到这一点。这不是亿万富翁。我收到了几十条来自创始人、商业领袖、CEO的短信、电子邮件和电话，他们都表示，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Freeberg**: It's not people don't realize this. It's not billionaires. I've received dozens of texts, emails, calls from people, founders, business leaders, CEOs that are out

</details>

**Freeberg**: 如果在四月，这件事最终进入投票，他们就会退出，因为他们觉得大势已定。如果**加利福尼亚州**的政客们没有人愿意站出来谈论**私人财产权**，没有人愿意说这会导致该州乃至整个国家的死亡螺旋，如果没人会说这些，那么这件事发生只是时间问题，而且它迟早会影响到我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Freeberg**: if in April this thing ends up on the ballot because they're like writings on the wall. If no politicians in California are willing to stand up and talk about private property rights and no one's willing to say like this leads to a death spiral for the state and potentially for the country and no one's going to say that, then it's only a matter of time before this happens and it's only a matter of time before it hits me.

</details>

**Jason**: 所以每个人都在寻找一个地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: And so everyone is looking for a place.

</details>

**Saxs**: 让我给你一个数据点。呃，还有其他工会没有参与这项投票倡议，他们正在为2028年准备类似的倡议，那些投票倡议将更加坚不可摧。它们将有更好的法律支持。所有这些。更有可能经受住宪法挑战。我相信，之所以存在对**BTA**的政治反对，是因为它只由一个工会完成。**SEIU**，呃，这个人是自己做的，而这次没收的所有收益几乎都将归这个工会或其事业所有。所以他们没有让其他工会分一杯羹。他们没有让其他工会尝到甜头。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: Let me let me give you a data point on that. Um there are other unions who weren't part of this ballot initiative who are preparing similar ones for 2028 and those ballot initiatives are going to be more bulletproof. They're going to be better lawyered. All that kind of stuff. More likely to survive constitutional challenges. The only reason why there is political opposition I believe to the BTA is because it was done by only one union. the SEIU uh this guy did it on his own and the loot all the proceeds from this confiscation would go almost all of it would go just to this one union or its causes. So they didn't cut in the other unions on the loot. They didn't wet the other unions beaks.

</details>

**Saxs**: 因此，其他工会实际上是反对它的。这就是为什么**Newsome**和其他政客在表示反对时感到相对不受约束的原因。这就是为什么我认为，如果我们能在26年击败它，这并不意味着它永远消失了。这只是意味着它将在28年以新的形式卷土重来，但会得到更广泛的工会支持，所有工会将共同行动。所以，我只是认为这是不可避免的。而且我认为，你知道，对于所有创始人，无论你是**退出前**、**退出后**，还是正在**退出中**，

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: As a result of that, the other unions are actually against it. And this is why Newsome and the other politicians feel relatively unconstrained in saying they're opposed to it. And that's why I think that if we defeat this in 26, it doesn't mean it's dead for good. It just means it's going to come back in a new form in 28, but with much more broad-based union support, all the unions are going to do it together. So, I just think this is inevitable. And I think that, you know, for all the founders and whether you're pre-exit, postexit, or on your way to an exit,

</details>

**Saxs**: 我的建议是，引用**Maya Angelou**的话，当一个州向你展示他们的真面目时，第一次就相信他们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: my advice would be that to quote Maya Angelou, when a state shows you who they are, believe them the first time.

</details>

**Saxs**: 这就是**加利福尼亚州**的发展方向。无论是**SEIU**还是他们做什么，这就是它的走向。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: This is the direction of travel in California. And whether it's SEIU or whatever they do, this is where it's going.

</details>

**Freeberg**: 他们很乐意看到一些东西。也许你说了些让我产生共鸣的话，那就是这个的下一个版本将有更好的法律支持，更坚不可摧。我有一个团队一直在研究这个问题。这里最大的弱点是，这是一种全新的税收，而且是追溯适用的。当你查看联邦层面的最高法院，关于这个问题的判例法，这是人们将面临的最强烈的挑战，这也是有利于人们的证据占压倒性优势的地方，他们会说这是不公正的，这是一种征用，并且能够利用最高法院驳回此事。现在，这需要5到10年的时间来诉讼，因为它会在法庭上拖延很久。但是当你考虑到如果这个法案通过，这将是人们采取的攻击角度时，我100%同意你的观点，**Saxs**。如果这个工会足够聪明，他们会说这将在1月7日开始。它可能会进入投票。它可能会通过，他们会得到所有的好处，而且在法律上很难挑战这件事。那是那个工会的一个巨大失算。但在28年或30年或32年，这会再次出现其丑恶的面目。它将设计得更好，而且将没有任何办法可以规避。到那时，为什么要在1后面加9个零的地方划一条人为的线呢？为什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Freeberg**: They'd love to see something. Perhaps you said something that resonated with me, which is the next versions of this will be better lawyered and more bulletproof. I've had a team of people looking at this. The thing that is the biggest weakness here is looking at the fact that this is a wholly new tax that is applied retroactively. And when you look at the Supreme Court at the federal level, the case law on this, this is the strongest challenge that people will have and this is where there is a prepoundonderance of evidence in the favor of people saying that this is unjust and this is a taking and being able to use the Supreme Court to bat this back. Now, that'll take 5 and 10 years to litigate because it'll be there drawing itself through the courts forever. But when you look at the fact that that will be the angle of attack that people will take if this passes, I 100% agree with you Saxs. If this union were smart enough, what they would have done is say this is going to start Jan7. It probably would make the ballot. It probably would pass and they would get all the loot and it would be very difficult to legally challenge this thing. It was a huge miscalculation by that union. But in 28 or 30 or 32, this will rear its ugly head. It will be better architected and there will be no way around it. And at that point, why create an artificial line at one with nine zeros after it? Why?

</details>

**Saxs**: 为什么？顺便说一句，蠢货，去到1亿。把所有人都搞定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: Why? And by the way, stupid go to 100 million. Get everybody.

</details>

**Jason**: 哇，哇，哇，哇，哇，哇。让我们把那个数字再提高一点。让我们把它提高到2.5亿。如果我们说的是对的，那么为什么它不会在国家层面发生呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's move that number up a little bit. Let's get to Let's get it to 250. And if what we're saying is right, then why would it not happen at a national level?

</details>

**Saxs**: 当然会。是的。他们会开始在全国各地追捕你。只是……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: Of course it will. Yes. They're going to start chasing you around the country. It's just

</details>

**Freeberg**: 嗯，我告诉你为什么。因为我们国家其他地方仍然有很多保守派。**加利福尼亚州**完蛋了。但我们必须开始在其他州堆积沙袋。**Freeberg**，你在你的帖子中说了一些我非常喜欢的话，那就是它引出了一个问题：当**加利福尼亚州**破产时会发生什么？然后他们会去找联邦政府，那时谁掌权实际上并不重要。但让我们想想看。如果**特朗普**掌权一秒钟，**加利福尼亚州**敲门说：“嘿，我需要你来救我们。”**加利福尼亚州**需要与总统达成协议，才能让这变得可以接受，这样他才能围绕它建立一个共和党联盟。伙计，**加利福尼亚州**将经历巨大的痛苦。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Freeberg**: Well, because I'll tell you why. Because we still have plenty of conservatives in the rest of the country. California is screwed. But we got to start stacking sandbags around the rest of the states. Freeberg, you said something that I really liked in your post, which is it begs the question, what will happen when California goes BK and then they go to the feds and it doesn't actually matter who is in charge at that time. But let's think about it. If Trump were in charge for a second, California knocks and says, "Hey, I need you to bail us out." the deal that California would need to do with the president for that to even be palatable so that he could build a coalition of Republicans around it. Man, California will go through tremendous pain

</details>

**Jason**: 措施。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: measures,

**Freeberg**: 但随后会走出困境。所以现在想象一下**AOC**是总统，**AOC**是总统。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Freeberg**: but then go through the other side. So now imagine AOC's president, AOCC's president.

</details>

**Freeberg**: 所以她说，我必须这样做，然后当它提交给国会时，这实际上会如何发生？这再次让我觉得**Sax**是对的。只要存在49:51的平衡，我认为在**加利福尼亚州**没有真正深刻的紧缩措施，任何事情都无法真正发生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Freeberg**: So she says, I got to do this and then when it goes to Congress, how does this actually happen? This is again where I think Sax is right. As long as there is a 4951 kind of a balance, I don't think anything can really happen without meaningfully deep austerity in California.

</details>

**Jason**: 我认为有办法解决。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: I think there's a way out for

**Freeberg**: 现在如果那时阻挠议事已经消失。

**Freeberg**: 而且是简单多数，然后如果椭圆形办公室里有一个民主党人，再加上一个民主党国会。是的。

**Saxs**: **David**，你说得对，因为那是他们联邦层面的一次机会，他们有两年的窗口期来执行这个计划，他们将能够完成它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: David, you're right because that is the one shot on goal that they have a two-year window to run that play at the federal level and they will be able to get it done.

</details>

**Freeberg**: 现在问问自己，**佛罗里达州**的公民、**德克萨斯州**的公民、**北达科他州**的公民以及所有这些支付联邦税的州的公民会发生什么？他们州没有这个问题，他们基本上是在支付**阿拉斯加**。**阿拉斯加**有盈余。为什么所有这些公民，这就是工会开始瓦解的地方，这也是我非常担心这会走向何方的地方。一旦你允许这项**资产征用税**通过，即使是在州一级，经济后果也是不可避免的，一些州将不得不救助其他州，那时事情就会变得非常糟糕。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Freeberg**: Now ask yourself the question, what happens to the citizens of Florida, the citizens of Texas and the citizens of North Dakota and the citizens of all these states that pay federal taxes have not had this problem in their state and they're basically paying Alaska. Alaska has a surplus. Why would all those citizens and this is where the union starts to unravel and that's where I get very concerned about where this leads. As soon as you allow this asset seizure tax to pass even on a state level, the economic ramifications or on a national level, the economic ramifications are inevitable that some states are going to have to bail out other states and that's where things get very ugly.

</details>

**Jason**: 账单总有一天会来的。对于民主党人或支持者来说，这里有一个非常简单的出路。先打击**欺诈**，再谈税收。这必须是未来的口号。我们将消除**欺诈**和浪费，然后我们再讨论税收。这是他们找到逃生舱口的唯一途径。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: The bill will come to at some point. There's a super easy out here for the Democrats or people who are supporting this. Just go after fraud first, taxes second. That's got to be the mantra going forward. We're going to eliminate fraud and waste and then we'll have a discussion about taxes. That's the only way for them to find an escape hatch here.

</details>

**Saxs**: 好的。我们有温和派。是的。我的意思是，但是这里有一些有趣的统计数据。所以，**加利福尼亚州**的人均税收大约是**德克萨斯州**和**佛罗里达州**的两倍。所以，**加利福尼亚州**每纳税人征收大约10319美元，而**德克萨斯州**是5469美元。**佛罗里达州**是4914美元。所以这里不存在**加利福尼亚州**税收不足的问题。问题完全出在支出上。在这方面，**加利福尼亚州**的预算在过去十年中翻了一番，而人口却保持不变。事实上，

**Saxs**: Okay. We have the moderates. You're Yeah. I mean, like, but just just some interesting stats here. So, California collects roughly double per capita what Texas and Florida do. So, California collects about $10,319 per taxpayer, whereas Texas 5,469. Florida 4,914. So, there's not an issue here of California not collecting enough taxes. The issue is all on the spending.

**Saxs**: 它流向了这些政府工人**工会**，他们积累了过多的政治权力。看，你可以追溯到**FDR**，他反对政府工人**工会**，尽管他支持**工会**。他反对政府工人**工会**，因为他认为他们会积累过多的政治权力，他们选举政客，然后政客们支付他们。所以他们只是在每个选举周期中迭代地提取越来越多的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: It's going to these government worker unions who have accumulated too much political power. Look, you go all the way back to FDR and he was opposed to even though he was a for unions. He was opposed to government workers unions because he thought they would accumulate too much political power and they elect the politicians and then the politicians are the ones paying them. So they just end up extracting more and more and more iteratively with every election cycle.

</details>

**Freeberg**: 这与公司中的反垄断垄断是一样的。它与私人工业和公司中的垄断具有相同的最终动态。它基本上赋予你政治权力的垄断，并赋予你垄断资产的能力。这实际上就是我们现在的处境。他们已经到了一个工会说：“我要从州内一小部分人那里拿走1000亿美元的资产。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Freeberg**: It's the same as an antitrust monopoly in a corporation. It's the same ultimate dynamics as having a monopoly in private industry and corporations. It basically gives you a monopoly on political power and it gives you the ability to monopolize assets. And that's effectively where we are now. They're at the point where one union is saying, "I'm going to take the assets, hundred billion dollars of assets from a small minority of people in the state."

</details>

**Saxs**: 现实是，其中很大一部分是**养老金义务**。

**Saxs**: 在22岁时为州政府工作，42岁就可以退休。实际上，很多人会去从事第二份政府工作，并累积第二份养老金。但是，是的，如果你把加班费都算进去，你可以在42岁退休。是的。

**Saxs**: for the state at 22 and you can retire at 42. Actually, what a lot of people do is they'll go then take a second government job and they'll stack a second pension. But yeah, you could retire at 42 if you if you stuff it with over. Yeah,

**Chamath**: 你需要做**养老金基金**。你必须让人们随着时间的推移参与市场。政府不应该管理这个。政府做任何事情都很糟糕，而且他们要做的事情太多了。让它独立运作。把它拿出来。把它划分出来。你被迫投入12%到这个基金中，或者你的雇主投入一点，然后我们就会有一个非常幸福的社会。更多地参与市场。它会解决很多问题。好的。我只想谈最后一个话题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: You you need to do superanuation funds. You have to have people buying into the market over time. And the government shouldn't be managing this. It's just the government is terrible at whatever it does and there's too much for them to do. Let it stand alone. Take it out. Carve it out. You're you're forced to put 12% into this or your employer puts a little bit into it and then we'd have a very happy society. More participation in the market. It would solve so many problems. Okay. I just want to hit one last topic.

</details>

### 特朗普的格陵兰岛收购计划

**Chamath**: 恭喜**格陵兰岛**，呃，接受了**特朗普总统**非常慷慨的提议。我们欢迎你成为第51个州。也许这很快就会发生。美国官员周三在**白宫**会见了**丹麦**和**格陵兰岛**的代表，讨论美国如何控制**格陵兰岛**。这已经是**特朗普**多年来一直在谈论的事情了。记住我的**特朗普总统**第一条规则。他说了很多事情。无论如何，我们将在2025年3月4日得到它。出于心理原因，我需要真正拥有它。2021年。他说我们将对**格陵兰岛**做些什么，要么是友好的方式，要么是更困难的方式。2026年1月9日。**丹麦**似乎不想合作。他们说他们对此有根本性的分歧。话虽如此，那里只有5万人，**Polymarket**给出的我们收购它的几率是17%，这作为一个起点是相当可观的。5万人每人获得50万或100万美元，可能是一个相当不错的交易。这是一块非常具有战略意义的土地。如果你看看冰盖融化的情况，**Sachs**，以及**俄罗斯**在北极部署了大量船只，有一条相当清晰的航线经过**格陵兰岛**通往美国东北部。所以也许你可以谈谈为什么会这样，再次强调你不是代表政府发言，这不是你的领域，但为什么**格陵兰岛**如此重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: Congratulations to Greenland on uh accepting a very generous offer from President Trump. We welcome you as the 51st state. Maybe that'll be happening any day now. US officials met with reps from Denmark and Greenland at the White House on Wednesday to discuss how the US could take control of Greenland. This has been something Trump's been talking about for years. And remember my rule number one of President Trump. He says a lot of things. One way or another, we're going to get it March 4th, 2025. I need it for psychological reasons to actually own it. 2021. He said that we're going to do something with Greenland, either the nice way or the more difficult way. January 9th, 2026. Denmark doesn't seem to want to play ball. They say they have a fun fundamental disagreement about this. That being said, there's only 50,000 people there and it's a Poly Market's got it at 17% chance that we acquire it, which is significant as a starting point. 50,000 people getting a half million or a million dollars each would probably be a pretty good deal. It's a very strategic piece of land. If you look at what's happening with the ice caps melting sacks and Russia positioning a lot of their ships up in the Arctic, there's a pretty clean shot going past Greenland to the northeast of America. So maybe you could just talk about why this is and again you're not speaking for the administration and it's not your lane but why is Greenland so important.

</details>

**Saxs**: 嗯，从国家安全的角度来看，随着北极冰盖融化，新的航运线路开辟，它变得越来越重要。所以它在那方面很重要。但是看，美国政客长期以来一直想收购**格陵兰岛**。伟大的国务卿**William Seard**想收购它。他收购了**阿拉斯加**。他也想得到**格陵兰岛**，但未能达成交易。但是**FDR**和**Truman**都对收购**格陵兰岛**感兴趣。显然没有成功。所以这是一个旧想法，由于**特朗普总统**而再次焕发新生。我认为他提出了一个很好的观点。它为什么属于**丹麦**人？你知道，它是一个欧洲小国。它不属于北美洲。我认为如果我们可以为了国家安全和资源原因收购它，我们就应该这样做。而且我认为他成功实现这一目标的几率远高于17%。**Chamath**或**Freeberg**，你们对第51个州有什么看法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: Well it is becoming more significant from a national security standpoint as those Arctic ISIS melt and you have new shipping lanes that have opened up. So it is important on on that dimension. But look, American politicians have wanted to acquire Greenland for a long time. The great Secretary of State William Seard wanted to acquire it. He acquired Alaska. He wanted to get Greenland to was unable to make that deal. But FDR and Truman both were interested in acquiring Greenland. It didn't work out obviously. So this is an old idea that's new again thanks to President Trump. I think he makes a great point. Why does it belong to the Danes? You know, it's a small country in Europe. It's not part of North America. And I think if we can acquire it for national security reasons and resource reasons, we should. And I think the odds of him pulling this off are much greater than 17%. Chimath or Fberg, you have any thoughts on the 51st state?

</details>

**Freeberg**: 我对此一无所知。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Freeberg**: I don't know anything about it.

</details>

**Jason**: 嗯，他们不必成为一个州，明确地说。不，他们可以成为……

**Jason**: Well, they don't have to become a state to be clear. No, they can become

**Saxs**: 是的。我的意思是，领土，无论是什么。是的。可以像一个乡村俱乐部，随便什么。重要的是我们获得会员资格。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: Yeah. I mean, territory, whatever it is. Yeah. Could be like a country club, whatever. It's it's important that we get get memberships.

</details>

**Saxs**: 这是西半球一块巨大的房地产。**丹麦**拥有它并没有太大意义。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: This is a huge piece of real estate in the Western Hemisphere. It doesn't really make a ton of sense for Denmark to own it.

</details>

**Saxs**: 它成为美国的一部分更有意义。而且……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: It makes a lot more sense for it to be part of the US. And

</details>

**Saxs**: 我们愿意为此付费。我认为我们可以给他们一个他们无法拒绝的提议。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: we're willing to pay for it. And I think that we can make them an offer that they can't refuse.

</details>

**Jason**: 绝对是。而且它有……

**Saxs**: 我们要派**Luca Brazie**过去。

**Jason**: 结束了。它有很多铁路矿产。近海有很多石油。他们现在的主要出口显然是鱼，但**Freeberg**，这在资源方面有很大的潜力。呃，是的，为什么不把它搞定呢？**特朗普**喜欢房地产。我们还有他三年。我说让**特朗普总统**大展身手，如果他想买其他土地，我支持。我喜欢建立帝国。这是我最喜欢的**特朗普**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: off. It's got a lot of railroads minerals. There's a lot of oil offshore. Their big export now is is fish obviously, but this has lots of potential, Freeberg, in terms of the resources. And um yeah, why not get it done? Trump loves real estate. We got him for another three years. I say let President Trump cook and if he wants to buy some other land, I'm here for it. I love building the empire. This is my favorite Trump.

</details>

**Chamath**: **Frag**，你喜欢这个**特朗普**还是不喜欢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: Frag, you love this Trump or not.

</details>

**Freeberg**: 老话常说，总有交易。总有价格。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Freeberg**: The old adage is there's always a deal. There's always a price

</details>

**Chamath**: 除了当你与政府谈判时。所以，我不知道那会怎样。我的理解，我的经验是他们不想达成交易。他们不感兴趣。这与民族自豪感有很大关系。你不能打破民族自豪感，正如我们作为美国爱国者所知。与民族自豪感作斗争非常困难。我不知道经济因素是否真的会起作用，但安全保障，也许对伟大的**丹麦**王国还有其他好处。这可能成为美国强大的联盟和伙伴关系。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: except when you're negotiating with the government. So, I don't know how that's going to go. My understanding, my experience is that they do not want a deal. They're not interested. There's a whole bunch of national pride associated with that. You can't break national pride as we know as patriots of America. It is very hard to fight national pride. I don't know if the economics are really going to play out, but security guarantees, maybe other benefits for the the great kingdom of Denmark. There could be a strong alliance and partnership for the United States.

</details>

**Saxs**: 我认为对美国来说，拥有一个新的**边疆**可能很重要。你知道，也许我们可以做的是把所有这些进步的社会主义者……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: I think it could be important for the US to have a new frontier. You know, maybe what we can do is send all these progressive socialists

</details>

**Saxs**: 送到**格陵兰岛**去开辟这个新**边疆**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: off to Greenland to tame this new frontier.

</details>

**Jason**: 我想把**Mandami**送到那里，让他们得到那个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: I want to go send Mandami there and they get that.

</details>

**Saxs**: 我们需要那个。我们需要那种**边疆**精神，那种牛仔精神，那种探索精神。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: We need that. We need that spirit of the frontier of of cowboys, of exploration.

</details>

**Jason**: 是的。那个**Mandami**。他看起来是个非常坚韧、顽强的人。他会带着他的整个团队，社会主义的**Roana**。让他去那里安顿下来。让我们看看……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Yes. That Mandami. He seems like a very resilient, gritty guy. He'll come with his whole crew, the socialist Roana. Let him set up there. Let's see what

</details>

**Chamath**: 拥有一个所谓的**自由省**或**自由州**或**自由城市**的想法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: the idea of having what's called a freedom province or freedom state or freedom city,

</details>

**Jason**: 经济自由区。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: economic free zone. Yeah.

</details>

**Chamath**: 是的。而且我确实认为，如果我们正在面临美国社会主义的威胁，我认为社会主义在社会上会导致个人自由的毁灭和美国社会结构的退化，在那发生之前，重要的是那些站在另一边的人，在他们被选票和将与他们作斗争的民选官员压倒之前，在这一切发生之前，重要的是要考虑划出一块合法的领土。那块合法的领土应该允许伟大的美国联盟，伟大的美国精神的复兴。我们应该在我们的影响力范围内找到一个地方，在我们被压倒之前建立起来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: Yeah. And and I do think if we if we are looking down the barrel of socialism in the United States, which I think socially leads to a destruction of individual liberties and a degradation of the social fabric in America, before that happens, it's important that those who are on the other side and before they get overwhelmed with the votes and uh the elected officials that will fight against them, before this all happens, it's important to think about carving out illegal territory And that legal territory should allow for the resurrection of the great American Union, of the great American spirit. And we should find a place within our sphere of influence before we get overwhelmed to set up

</details>

**Saxs**: **德克萨斯州**，老兄。那叫**德克萨斯州**。记住**阿拉莫**。我们在这里做最后的抵抗。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: Texas, dude. It's called Texas. Remember the Alamo. We're making our last stand here.

</details>

**Jason**: 绝对是。50口径步枪都架在牧场上了。我认为建立一个联邦政府设立的东西会很有帮助，**Sachs**，你可以拥有像不可触犯的立法，规定这是不可触犯的，这是开创性的，无论是什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Absolutely. The 50 calibers are up on the ranch. I think it would be helpful to get something that's that's federally set up, Sachs, that you could have like untouchable legislation that says this is not to be touched, this is pioneering, whatever it is.

</details>

**Saxs**: 加入民兵。我们有民兵。也许**格陵兰岛**就是那个地方，但它必须是某种感觉困难、感觉开放、感觉有点未被触及的东西，并且被一套立法区域性地包裹起来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: Join the militia. We got a militia. And maybe Greenland is the place, but it's something that feels it's got to be something that feels difficult, something that feels open, something that feels a little bit untouched, and it's regionally encased with a set of legislated

</details>

**Saxs**: 像**关岛**或**波多黎各**这样的地方，你把它建立起来，然后你会说，看，这是不可触犯的。改变它需要一个大动作。一个人们可以得到保护，对抗即将到来的社会主义浪潮的地方。你知道，这有点有趣，我记得我高中历史课上学到，**边疆**在1910年左右正式结束了。我想那意味着每个经度基本上都被完全探索和定居了。那就是进步时代开始的时候。我确实有点想知道，**边疆**是否是这种压力积累的逃逸阀，你知道，经济中积累的怨恨。人们总是可以向西走，成为拓荒者，寻找新的领土。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: things like Guam or Puerto Rico or something where you set set it up and you're like, look, this is untouchable. It takes a a big action to change it. Something where people can have protection against the uh the socialist milu that's on the way. You know, it is kind of interesting as I remember from my high school history. I think the frontier was officially over at by 1910. I think that was meaning every longitude basically had been fully exploritude and longitude had been sort of settled. And that is when the progressive era kind of began. And I do kind of wonder whether the frontier was this like escape valve for pressure that builds up, you know, resentments that build up in the economy. People could always just go west and become pioneers and find new territory.

</details>

**Jason**: 对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: That's right.

</details>

**Saxs**: 在某种程度上，美国对欧洲来说就是这样，对吧？我的意思是，欧洲有点像一个过度拥挤的地方。它很压抑，人们只是离开了，他们可以通过去美国并在后来成为美国的土地上定居来选择退出，我有点想知道我们是否需要再次拥有类似的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: And in a way, that's what America was for Europe, right? I mean, Europe was sort of this overcrowded place. it was uh oppressive and people just left that they could opt out by going to America and settling over in what would become the United States and I kind of wonder whether maybe we need something like that again

</details>

**Jason**: 顺便说一句，所有不满的人，这样他们就不会成为美国民主社会主义者。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: and by the way all the discontents so they don't become democratic socialist of America

</details>

**Saxs**: 有一段时间，**数字边疆**成为了那个逃逸阀，但现在它正在被关闭，它被关闭了，而它一直运作的地方正在被社会主义者征服。所以问题是下一步是什么？我认为这是一个非常好的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Saxs**: and for a while the digital frontier became that escape valve but now that's being shut off and it's being closed down and the place where it's been run from is being subjugated to the socialist. So the question is what's next? I think it's a very good question.

</details>

**Chamath**: 嗯，问题是社会主义者，他们不是探险家。他们不是拓荒者。他们不创造任何东西。他们不是建设者。他们擅长的是劫持现有机构。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: Well, the problem is that the the socialists, they're not explorers. They're not pioneers. They don't create anything. They're not builders. What they are is they're really good at hijacking existing institutions.

</details>

**Jason**: 嗯哼。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jason**: Mhm.

</details>

**Chamath**: 他们所做的就是拿走伟大人物创造的东西，然后颠覆它们，夺取控制权。他们追求的就是完全控制。首先在**加利福尼亚州**，然后是**华盛顿**。但我确实想知道，某种释放阀的存在是否能推迟那一天，对吧？因为系统中的压力会减少。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chamath**: And that's what they do is they take things that were created by great people and they subvert them and they seize control. And that's what they're going for is total control. first in California and then in Washington. But I do wonder whether the existence of some sort of release valve might defer that day, right? Because you get less pressure building up in the system.

</details>

**Jason**: 是的。

And there's a website where the transportation company gets to log into the website and they're registered as one of the transportation companies and they're like, I took someone from this place to Target. and you get and you fill out all these forms and then you get a check immediately

**Freeberg**: 这是一个信任系统。

**Freeberg**: on the it's a trust system.

**Chamath**: 他们从不调查。他们不审计。他们不检查。什么都没有。所以**Nick Shirley**开始四处寻找这些运输公司，结果就像一家酒类商店。他会说：“运输公司在哪里？”酒类商店的人会说：“这里没有运输公司。”就像一个，你知道，墨西哥卷饼店，像一个熟食店。所有这些地方都是人们的运输公司。每周数千万美元就这样发放出去。顺便说一句，这不是种族问题。把它描绘成索马里人的事情对任何人都没有好处。我认为这就是让每个人都陷入困境的原因。事实是，顺便说一句，这也是让很多人无法真正看到**欺诈**的原因。这与索马里人无关。这与政府允许**欺诈**发生的事实有关。这与政府在此**欺诈**中是默许还是同谋的事实有关。我认为这就是人们需要关注的，忽略所有关于哪个社区或哪个群体或谁在做这件事的咆哮，只关注政府允许这种情况发生的事实。如果你想想**加利福尼亚州**每年花费3500亿美元，然后你问自己，那些政府机构和那些机构中的代理人是否在尽职尽责地确保没有**欺诈**发生？没有人会举手说“是”。他们是纳税人资金的优秀受托人。这就是我们都应该关注的，摆脱所有这些政治分歧和种族主义，关注政府这样做的事实。

**Chamath**: They never investigate. They don't audit. They don't check. Nothing. So Nick Shirley starts going around looking for the transportation companies and it's like a liquor store. He's like, "Where's the where's the transportation company?" Liquor store guys like there's no transportation here. It's like a you know a burrito place like a deli. Like all of these places are folks transportation companies. tens of millions of dollars a week just being given out. And by the way, this is not a race thing. It does no one any good to cast this as being a Somali thing. And that I think is what's getting everyone in trouble. The fact and it's and by the way, it's what shuts off a lot of people to actually being able to look at the fraud. And it's not about the Somali people. It's about the fact that fraud is allowed by the government. And it's about the fact that the government either is implicit or complicit in this fraud. And I think that that's what people need to pay attention to and and ignore all of the rattings about what community or what group or who's doing it and just focus on the fact that the government lets this happen. If you think about the state of California spending $350 billion a year and you ask yourself the question, are those government agencies and the agents in those agencies doing their job of making sure that there's no fraud taking place? There is no way anyone's going to raise their hand and say yes. They're great fiduciaries of taxpayer money. And that's what we should all be paying attention to and get out of the political divide on all this and the racism and all the and focus on the fact that the government does this
