### 明尼阿波利斯的秘密抵抗

**Rachel Abrams**: 这里是《纽约时报》的 Rachel Abrams，欢迎收听《每日新闻》（The Daily）。几周以来，**明尼阿波利斯**周围的抗议活动引起了全国关注，这座城市公开反抗联邦政府的**移民搜捕**行动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: From the New York Times, I'm Rachel Abrams and this is the Daily. For weeks, protests around Minneapolis have caught nationwide attention as the city shows open defiance to a federal immigration crackdown.

</details>

**抗议者**: 当我们的移民邻居受到攻击时，我们该怎么办？（反击！）但在幕后，一种更安静、有组织的抵抗已经成型。今天，我们的制片人 Anna Foley 和 Michael Simon Johnson 前往明尼阿波利斯实地记录这一努力。我们的同事 **Charles Homans** 将解释为什么这座城市成为了这场政府**遣返战略**争夺战的零地带。今天是 1 月 21 日，星期三。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Protesters**: When our immigrant neighbors are under attack, WHAT DO WE DO? (Stand up, fight back!) BUT BEHIND the scenes, a quieter, organized resistance has taken shape. Today, our producers Anna Foley and Michael Simon Johnson go on the ground in Minneapolis to capture that effort. And our colleague Charles Homans explains why the city has become ground zero in the fight over the government's deportation strategy. It's Wednesday, January 21st.

</details>

**Michael Simon Johnson**: 我是 Michael Simon Johnson，我和《纽约时报》记者 **Charlie Homans** 在一起。我们现在具体是在哪个街区？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Simon Johnson**: This is Michael Simon Johnson. I'm here with New York Times reporter Charlie Homans. And we are What neighborhood are we in actually?

</details>

**Charlie Homans**: 这里是明尼阿波利斯南部的 **Lin-Lake** 地区。它得名于我们现在站的这个交叉路口：林代尔大道（Lindale Avenue）和湖街（Lake Street）。这里是近期移民、定居难民与明尼阿波利斯典型的**白人自由派城市文化**交汇的地方。由于城市中 **ICE（美国移民与海关执法局）** 的搜捕行动，这些群体以一种有趣的方式被联系在了一起。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Charlie Homans**: So, this is the Lin Lake area of Minneapolis. We're in South Minneapolis and it's named after this intersection that we're standing at actually which is Lindale Avenue and Lake Street. It's kind of the place where sort of the recent waves of immigrants and settled refugees and the Minneapolis of the kind of white liberal urban culture intersect and those groups have been kind of have been brought together in an interesting way by this ICE crackdown in the city.

</details>

**Charlie Homans**: 我的意思是，明尼阿波利斯与芝加哥或洛杉矶等其他搜捕目标城市的不同之处在于，它是一个很小的城市，人口不多，但派往这里的**联邦特工**数量却非常庞大。我听当地人说，在过去的几周里，那些可能成为搜捕目标的人真的觉得完全不敢出门。因此，这成了许多当地组织和企业的动员焦点，他们正在收集捐赠物资。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Charlie Homans**: I mean, the thing that's different about Minneapolis compared to Chicago or Los Angeles or other cities that have been targets of this crackdown so far is that it's a very small city. It doesn't have that many people in it. And the number of federal agents that have been sent here is really quite huge. And what I've been hearing just talking to people here is that, you know, in the last few weeks, you know, people who are potential targets of these raids have really felt like they can't leave their homes at all. And so that has kind of become a focus of the organizing of of a lot of these local organizations and businesses which are kind of gathering donations.

### 成人用品店里的互助网络

**Michael Simon Johnson**: 我们正要去其中一个地方。告诉我那是什么地方，以及它在你提到的这个网络中扮演什么角色？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Simon Johnson**: So we're about to go to one of these places. Tell me about what this place is and then what its role is in the this kind of network that you're talking about.

</details>

**Charlie Homans**: 好的，我们要去 **Smitten Kitten**，这是林代尔大道上的一家**成人用品店**。它在最近发生的这些事情中扮演了一个非常有趣的角色。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Charlie Homans**: Sure. So, we're going to go to Smitten Kitten, which is a sex shop on Lindale here, and it's been playing a very interesting role kind of what's been happening here lately.

</details>

**Michael Simon Johnson**: 好的，我们进去吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Simon Johnson**: Okay. Well, let's go inside.

</details>

**店员**: 我叫 Layman，在 Smitten Kitten 工作两年了。平时我们是一家成人商店，专注于提供准确的**性教育**信息，也有适合各种性别的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Worker**: So, I'm Layman, I work here at the Smitten Kitten for the past 2 years. During the regular day, we are an adult store. Um, we really focus on trying to give people like accurate information about sex education. We also have stuff for like every gender ever.

</details>

**Michael Simon Johnson**: 令人印象深刻的是，这虽然是一家装修精美、布局考究的成人用品店，但在前台却有这个……

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Simon Johnson**: Well, it it is very striking that this is like a sex shop, a really nice one, beautifully laid out, but also at the front there's this uh

</details>

**店员**: **互助（Mutual Aid）**。是的，我们一直都在做互助，但最近我们扩大了规模，基本上让互助物资填满了整个店。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Worker**: mutual aid. Yeah, we're always doing mutual aid, but we just expanded it and like imploded ourselves with mutual aid basically.

</details>

**Michael Simon Johnson**: 我们去楼下看看。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Simon Johnson**: Well, um let's let's go downstairs.

</details>

**店员**: 好的。我现在正走过科幻奇幻按摩棒区域。这里是我们目前存放**尿布**的地方。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Worker**: Yeah. Sweet. I'm now walking past the sci-fi fantasy dildo section. Here's where we're keeping our diapers right now.

</details>

**Michael Simon Johnson**: 东西真多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Simon Johnson**: This is a lot.

</details>

**店员**: 是的，有 11 箱，挺疯狂的。还有很多箱**奶粉**和湿纸巾。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Worker**: Yeah. It was 11 boxes, which was kind of crazy. Lots of boxes of diapers, lots of boxes of formula, wipes.

</details>

**Michael Simon Johnson**: 过去几天大概有多少人来领物资？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Simon Johnson**: Probably a thousand people over the past couple of days.

</details>

**Michael Simon Johnson**: 货物流转很快吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Simon Johnson**: But the the goods are moving. Like you're not like

</details>

**店员**: 我们不会积压，必须发出去。这种量和紧迫感是疯狂的。人们会带着他们的证件进店，他们很害怕。即使冒着被 **ICE** 抓走的风险，他们也要离开家来这里获取资源。他们都想向我证明自己情况的真实性，但我说，我真的不在乎，你不需要告诉我，因为我知道你身后的下一个人也有同样的故事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Worker**: we're not sitting on it. It's got to go. It is insane the volume and the urgency that we have been meeting people with. They will be bringing their papers into the store. They are afraid. They are leaving their house to come here to get resources even though they are at risk for being picked up by ICE. And they're all wanting to prove to me the validity of that. And I'm like, I really don't care. Like, you don't have to tell me because I know that the next person behind you has the exact same story.

</details>

**Michael Simon Johnson**: 感觉大家根本没时间注意到墙上的按摩棒，因为你的家庭正面临分崩离析，这才是店里关注的焦点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Simon Johnson**: It's like there's no time to notice that there's a dildo on the wall because like your family is being torn apart that that's what's in the store.

</details>

**Michael Simon Johnson**: 我很好奇，你认为像这样的一家店站在社区响应的最前线，说明了明尼阿波利斯现在的什么情况？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Simon Johnson**: I'm curious like what you think it says about sort of Minneapolis right now that a shop like this is kind of on the front lines of the community response.

</details>

**店员**: 性工作者和类似的边缘化群体会让你变得激进。我在脱衣舞俱乐部学到，其实每个人都赞同变革，只是我们没有统一的语言来讨论它。我觉得我们启发了其他企业也开始接收捐赠并分发给邻居。我整天都在告诉人们，我们设立的资源点越多，ICE 就越难追踪每个人的动向，因为甚至有 **ICE 特工**从我们店开始跟踪别人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Worker**: Yeah. Sex workers and marginalized groups of people like that will radicalize you. I really learned in the strip club that everyone agrees with the revolution. We just don't all have the same language to talk about it. And I feel like we inspired a bunch of other businesses to begin taking in donations and like distributing them to their neighbors. And I've been telling people all day long like the more spots that we can pop up with resources, the harder time that ICE is going to have keeping track of where everyone is at because we've also had ICE agents follow people from our spot.

</details>

### 枪击事件后的社区哀悼

**Michael Simon Johnson**: 你描述的是一种全市范围的……我不知道该用什么词，是运动、网络，还是某种转变？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Simon Johnson**: What you're describing is a at least citywide I don't know exactly what the right word is. I don't know if it's like a movement. I don't know if it's a network. I don't know if it's like a change in

</details>

**店员**: 就像是一群人意识到：“噢，救援真的不会来了。” 2020 年发生的一些事让我第一次意识到，邻居的房子着火了，消防队却没来，所以你最好自己找根水管。为什么我，Smitten Kitten 的一个普通员工，做的比市长 **Jacob Frey** 还要多？你会觉得你正在做的事情更有实效，有直接的影响。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Worker**: It's like a bunch of people realizing like, oh, they're really not coming. Something that happened in 2020 was the first time I realized like my neighbor's house is on fire and the fire department is not coming. So, you better find a garden hose. Like, why am I and layman at the smitten kitten doing more than Jacob Frey? You you feel like you're doing something that is far more actionable is having like immediate direct

</details>

**Michael Simon Johnson**: 同一天，我去了就在一周前 **ICE 官员**开枪打死明尼阿波利斯居民 **Renee Good** 的现场，位于该市南侧。我站在波特兰大道（Portland）和 35 街的拐角处。树上贴着一张告示，写着“访客指南”：你进入的这个街区已成为**哀悼空间**。请记住，你是这里的客人。深呼吸，慢速行驶。以敬畏之心对待这个空间。发现可疑活动请通知社区领袖。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Simon Johnson**: So that same day, I went to the site where just a week earlier, an ICE officer had shot and killed a Minneapolis resident, Renee Good, in the city's southside. I'm on the corner of Portland and 35th on one end of the block. And there is uh there's a sign on this tree that someone posted. It says visitor guide. The block you are entering has become a space of mourning. Remember, you are a guest in this neighborhood. Take a deep breath. Drive slow. Approach the space with reverence. Notify neighborhood leaders of suspicious activity.

</details>

**Michael Simon Johnson**: 那里有很多鲜花、旗帜和泰迪熊。一群人升起了火堆。一辆车停下来，问是否需要更多木柴，然后卸下木柴就走了。现场大约有十几个人，有的只待几分钟，有的则久久不愿离去。我问一位带花来的女士，她现在是什么心情？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Simon Johnson**: There's a lot of flowers, a lot of flags, a lot of teddy bears. There's a bunch of people that have made a fire. Car just pulled up like driving down the block, stopped, asked if these people need more firewood for this fire, and dropped it off. There were about a dozen people there. Some people were staying for just a few minutes, others were lingering. I asked a woman who' brought flowers what she was feeling.

</details>

**居民**: 情绪很复杂。一方面为这个家庭感到心碎，因为这本不必发生。但另一方面你又高度警惕，盯着每一辆贴了深色车膜的车，想表达敬意，又得提防是否有人会来驱散我们。今天我们楼里的清洁工下班，我开车送她回家，因为我说今天别去公交站等车了，那里不再安全。这太让人难过了。在**双城**（Twin Cities），如果你想帮忙或需要帮助，只要开口就行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Resident**: You have a mixed emotions because you have just this heartbroken feeling for the family because this did not have to happen. But then you have this hyper vigilance and you're watching every vehicle that has tinted windows and seeing, you know, it's like trying to pay your respects but also trying to watch out like is somebody going to come up here and break us up? Like today our building um we have a cleaning lady and I gave her a ride home today because I was like do not stand at the bus stop today. It's not safe anymore. So that's so sad. It's one of those things that it's if you want to help out in any way or if you need help, you know, all you have to do is ask. But that's I mean that's what many the Twin Cities is like.

### 从恐惧到行动：移民的抉择

**Anna Foley**: 我是 Anna Foley，我也在明尼阿波利斯待了一个周末。除了活动家和互助网络，还有许多人因为害怕被拘留或遣返而躲避 ICE。我采访了其中一位，我们称她为 **M**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Foley**: Anna Foley here. I'm a producer on the daily who also spent the weekend in Minneapolis. Along with the networks of activists, mutual aid, and neighbors taking care of neighbors, there are people avoiding ICE because they're afraid of getting detained or deported. Immigrants afraid of being targeted. I talked to one of them. We're calling her M.

</details>

**M**: 12 月 ICE 加大执法力度时，我意识到需要采取预防措施。我开始规划去大学和工作的不同路线，我甚至完全不再去超市了，虽然我很喜欢逛超市。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**M**: In December when ICE really ramped up enforcement. Em realized she needed to make some changes and take precautions. I start to strategize like different routes to get to university, different routes to get to work and I ended up not going to the grocery anymore at all. It's been a long time since I've been at the grocery and I love a grocery.

</details>

**Anna Foley**: M 并不确定自己是否是目标。她两岁时随父母来到美国，是一名 **DACA（童年入境者暂缓遣返计划）** 获得者，但现在她觉得这种身份非常脆弱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Foley**: M actually can't be sure she's a target. Her parents brought her to the US when she was two. She's a DACA recipient, but that feels very tenuous to her right now.

</details>

**M**: 有一段时间，我的计划是规避风险，保持低调。但随着时间推移，情况发生了变化。我看着那些搜捕和逮捕，然后 Renee Good 被杀了。这在我心中点燃了某种火焰，恐惧变成了愤恨和愤怒。我意识到每个人都在承担风险，你也可以为你的社区承担风险。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**M**: For a while, the plan was avoid risk, lay low. But over time, that changed. She was watching the raids, the arrests, and then Renee Good was killed. It kind of set something on fire for me. The fear became like resentment and became anger. And as soon as I realized that like everybody's taking a risk, you might as well also take a risk for your community.

</details>

**Anna Foley**: 承担风险意味着，她不再刻意避开 ICE，而是专门走那些可能见到他们路线，以便在 **Signal** 聊天群中提醒活动家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Foley**: Taking a risk meant that instead of going out of her way trying to avoid run-ins with ICE, she took routes where she knew she might see them so she could alert activists on a signal chat.

</details>

**M**: 我会看到可疑车辆，然后发信息：“嘿，在这个路口的加油站有一辆奇怪的车，提醒大家一下。” 有时人们会问我能不能绕回去确认，我很明确地说我不能掉头，但我提供了信息。这让我感觉好些，希望这能有所帮助。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**M**: I would see suspicious vehicles and I'd be like, "Hey, there's a weird vehicle at the gas station at this crosssection. Just letting you guys know." And you know sometimes people ask of you if you can like circle back and I was not able to. I was very explicit. I was like I could not turn around but here's the information and that felt okay. I'm like here here you go. Hope for the best. Hope this helps.

</details>

### 民间巡逻队：监视监视者

**Anna Foley**: M 提醒的网络就是这些在明尼阿波利斯激增的**民间巡逻队**。我联系了其中的两名成员，Patty 和 Mitch。在出发前，他们非常谨慎。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Foley**: The network M is alerting on signal when she sees ICE. I got in touch with some of the people who are on the other end. these civilian patrols that have proliferated in cities like Minneapolis. I met up with two of these activists, Patty and Mitch, on Friday afternoon.

</details>

**Mitch**: 出于极度谨慎，你介意口头告诉我你不是 ICE、CBP 或任何政府机构的人，并出示你的记者证吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mitch**: Just out of an abundance of question, would you mind verbally telling me that you're not with uh ICE CBP or any government agency and then show me your press credential?

</details>

**Anna Foley**: 我们上了车，Patty 带着笔记本。他们确认带好了**哨子**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Foley**: After a few minutes, we hopped into Mitch and Patty's car. Patty had brought along a small notebook. And before we left, they stopped to make sure they both had everything, especially their whistles.

</details>

**Patty**: 每次看到 ICE 我们都会吹哨。如果他们正在抓人或进行搜捕，我们会吹得更响。在过去的一周半里，即使你不在巡逻，你在家里或办事时，也能听到城里到处此起彼伏的哨声和汽车鸣笛声，那就是你知道 ICE 正在出没的方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Patty**: Um, every time we see ice, so that's been probably almost every every time that we've been out patrolling. And then if they're actually in the process of taking someone if they're in the process of a raid or something blowing the whistles a little bit harder. Yes, especially in the last week and a half. I mean, you will just be just in your house or running errands or you'll hear whistles here and there. You'll hear cars honking and that's how you know ICE is out and about.

</details>

**Anna Foley**: 巡逻队通过 Signal 群组协调。Patty 发现了一辆可疑的黑色卡车，记下了车牌号。群里有人会进行**车牌核查**。很快，群里传回消息：确认是 ICE。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Foley**: Patty told me people patrolling like this coordinate through group signal chats. Patty spotted a car that to their eyes seemed suspicious. Patty, what are you doing? I am writing down the license plate of this car and I am going to um ask for a plate check on it. We've got confirmed ICE for that.

</details>

**Anna Foley**: 约 20 分钟后，疑似 ICE 特工出现了。Patty 坦言她很紧张，因为一周前她刚被拘留过。当时特工向她的车里喷洒了**辣椒喷雾**，砸碎了车窗，将她拖出车外戴上手铐。尽管如此，她还是回来了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Anna Foley**: About 20 minutes after we started staking out this one truck, the suspected ICE agent emerged. Patty said she was particularly on edge. This was her first time out doing this after getting detained about a week earlier. Patty says one of the agents set off pepper spray. Smashed in um my front two windows and dragged us out of the car. um put us in handcuffs. Now, a few days later, here she was back out patrolling.

</details>

**Patty**: 我认为 ICE 逮捕和拘留像我这样最后被无罪释放的人，其目的就是为了制造恐惧，威慑人们不要做这些工作。对我来说，如果他们愿意投入资源来恐吓我们，那就说明我们的行动产生了影响。所以我要继续出现，尽我所能去**阻碍他们的工作**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Patty**: I think that ISIS's point in making these arrests and detaining people who are then often times let out without charges like I was is to, you know, intimidate people and deter them from doing this work. And to me, if they are willing to go through the whole process of trying to intimidate people like that and use their resources that way, then I think that that means that it's having some sort of impact. So, I want to keep showing up and doing everything that I possibly can to, you know, gum up the works.

</details>

### 为什么是明尼阿波利斯？

**Rachel Abrams**: Charlie，为什么联邦力量会专门降临在双城？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rachel Abrams**: Charlie, why has this federal force descended on the Twin Cities specifically?

</details>

**Charlie Homans**: 官方解释是针对索马里社区的欺诈丑闻。但如果你是特朗普政府，想抓捕大量非法移民，明尼阿波利斯是个奇怪的选择，因为它主要还是个白人城市。这背后的因素可能更多：明尼苏达是 **Tim Walz** 的家乡，他是特朗普极其厌恶的政治对手；这里也是一个特朗普从未赢过的自由派州。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Charlie Homans**: Well, the official Trump administration explanation is this fraud scandal. But if you're the Trump administration and you're looking to just arrest a lot of undocumented immigrants, Minneapolis is an odd choice because it's still a largely white city. Minnesota is the state of Tim Walz, the vice presidential candidate in 2024, who Trump does seem to truly hate. It's also a very liberal city in a state that Trump has not ever won.

</details>

**Charlie Homans**: 当然，明尼阿波利斯也是 **George Floyd** 遇害地。2020 年的阴影在这里挥之不去。有趣的是，人们现在应对危机所使用的许多关系和组织理念，正是当年应对弗洛伊德事件时留下的遗产——无论是协调抗议，还是进行邻里守望。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Charlie Homans**: Minneapolis, of course, is also the site of George Floyd's murder. You really see the kind of long shadow of 2020 in Minneapolis. A lot of the same relationships and organizing ideas that people used to respond to what was happening after George Floyd are being used now in sort of updated and evolved ways in the response to the federal deployment here.

</details>

**Charlie Homans**: 现在的局势已经超出了以往的经验。在其他城市，搜捕可能比较随机，但在明尼阿波利斯这样一个非白人非常显眼的小城市，人们感到一种前所未有的脆弱感。我采访过一些人，他们甚至在严肃地讨论：“我是否需要开始在家里腾出空房间来藏人？” 这是一个正在展开的历史性时刻。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Charlie Homans**: We're sort of off the map of prior experience. There's a sense of real vulnerability that feels different from other places. I've talked to people who have said like, "Am I going to need to start hiding people in, you know, spare room in my house?" And there is a real sense that this is an important moment in history that's unfolding.

</details>
