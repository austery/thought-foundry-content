### 抱负与科技行业展望

**发言人**: 如果你拥有真正远大的抱负，即使失败也能成就大事。如果你抱负不高，即使成功也一无所获。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: If you have really really high ambitions, you achieve great things even if you fail. If you have low ambitions, you achieve nothing even if you succeed.

</details>

**主持人**: 您认为科技行业将如何发展？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Where do you think the tech sector evolves from here?

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，这是个价值万亿美元的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Well, that's the trillion dollar question, right?

</details>

**主持人**: 幸运的是，您管理着两万亿美元的资产。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Luckily, you manage what, two trillion. So,

</details>

**发言人**: 当我在大学做演讲时，我问大家：“嘿，这里有没有人想法与众不同，觉得自己有点怪异的，请举手。”通常不到 **10%** 的人会举手。我说：“你们很棒，我们很乐意雇用你们。”然后另外 **90%** 的人，我就会说：“抱歉，你们和大家没什么两样，永远赚不了多少钱。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: when I give presentations at universities, I I ask people, hey, anybody here who thinks differently from other people who kind of think that they are weird, hands up. So, typically less than 10%. I said, you guys, you're great. We'd love to hire you. And then the other 90% is like, sorry guys, you're just like everybody else. You're never going to make much money.

</details>

### 房地产与利率趋势

**发言人**: 我从不涉足政治，因为我的工作完全不政治。但如果我能当一天首相，我会把 **AI** 注入到各个领域。回顾我们经历过的黄金时代，以及那些年我们拥有的真正权力，比如罗马、威尼斯，它们都是开放经济体，实行自由贸易，劳动力、思想等自由流动。这些黄金时代结束时，它们的共同点是，你现在反对的是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Okay, so I never do politics because my job is not is totally not political. But if I were like uh prime minister for a day, I would inject AI everywhere. If you look at the golden ages we've had and you look at, you know, the real powers we've had during the years, you know, Rome, Venice, they were open economies, free trade, um, free movement of, uh, labor, thought, and so on. What they all have in common in terms of the end of the golden ages is what are you leaning against right now?

</details>

**发言人**: 我认为，如果你真的想与众不同，那么现在应该反对的是减少 **AI** 相关投资，而增加房地产投资。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Well, I think uh the stuff to lean against if you really want to do the opposite of everybody else would be to, you know, do less AI related investments and more real estate investments.

</details>

**主持人**: 您如何看待房地产市场的发展？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How do you see real estate playing out?

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，这是个非常棘手的问题。但它现在不太受欢迎，我看到很多大投资者正在减少对房地产的敞口。所以，这可能是一个好兆头，预示着更好的时期即将到来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Well, that's a very tough one, right? But it's not very popular and I see that uh a lot of big investors are uh reducing their exposures to to real estate. So, that's probably a good sign, right, that there are better times ahead.

</details>

**主持人**: 您觉得办公楼市场怎么样？我猜那是房地产中最糟糕的类别。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What do you think of office? I I guess that's the worst real estate classroom.

</details>

**发言人**: 非常糟糕，非常糟糕。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: It's very bad. It's very bad.

</details>

**发言人**: 所以，你必须以某种方式思考，现在出现了一场完美的危机：**COVID** 意味着更多人居家办公；银行系统出现了一些问题；利率相对较高。因此，有几个因素对其产生了负面影响。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: So, you have to think uh in a way you've had a bit of a perfect crisis there now in that uh COVID meant that more people were working from home. You had uh some trouble with uh part of the banking system. You had rates uh being relatively high and so you had a few factors there uh impacting it negatively.

</details>

**主持人**: 您如何看待利率？我的意思是，历史上平均利率大约是 **6%** 左右，而我们已经低于这个水平近 **20** 年了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How do you think about rates? I mean historically there's been a I think the average is 6% or something somewhere thereabouts and we've been lower than that for almost 20 years now.

</details>

**发言人**: 是的，我们已经很长时间处于非常低的水平。我认为存在一些结构性问题，这意味着利率可能会比过去高一些。我认为这里有一个人们现在不太谈论的因素，那就是气候的影响。气候正在影响收成，影响许多原材料的价格，尤其是在食品方面，无论是巧克力、咖啡等等。然后你还会遇到各种火灾，气候对定价结构产生了许多影响。它还会影响保险费率，免费保险费率等等。这是一方面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Yeah. We have been very low and for a very long period of time. I think there are some structural issues which mean that they probably will be a bit higher than they have been and I think one one um factor here which uh people don't talk so much about just now is is the impact on climate you know so climate is impacting harvest is impacting prices for a lot of you know raw material and uh and impact factors in particular to the food side so be it uh chocolate coffee and so on then you got various fires uh you just you just get a lot of kind of impacts from climate on pricing structures um it also hits kind of insurance rates free insurance rates um and so on so that's on the one hand now

</details>

**发言人**: 另一方面，当然是 **AI** 带来的效率提升。你会有更低的成本，获得更高的智能。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: the thing which is pulling in the other direction is of course efficiency gains through AI and uh you'll have uh just much more intelligence uh at cheaper levels right

</details>

### AI热潮与生产力提升

**主持人**: 您认为科技行业将如何发展？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: where do you think the tech sector evolves from here.

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，这是个价值万亿美元的问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Well, that's the trillion dollar question, right?

</details>

**主持人**: 幸运的是，您管理着两万亿美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Luckily, you manage what, two trillion. So,

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，现在这个领域非常非常热门，我想我们对此都能达成共识。我觉得这很有趣。**英伟达**（**Nvidia**）的首席执行官 **黄仁勋**（**Jensen Huang**）去了韩国，他和三星的人一起出去玩，他们还吃了炸鸡。当他们在这家炸鸡店被拍到照片时，这家炸鸡连锁店的股价上涨了 **20%**。韩国一家养鸡公司的股价也大幅上涨，甚至生产炸鸡机器人手臂的公司股价也大幅上涨。这对我来说，仅仅表明这是一个非常非常热门的行业。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: um, it's pretty pretty hot, right? That I think we can agree on that. And I think it's quite interesting. So, you have Yansen Huang, the CEO of N Media, who goes to Korea, right? He hangs out with the guys at Samsung. they go and have uh some uh deep fried chicken and so when they are photographed in this uh chicken uh restaurant the share price of uh of that chicken chain is going up like 20% right and the company that actually breeds chicken in Korea is going up a lot and the company that does the robotic arms to actually deep fry the chicken is also going up a lot so it's uh just indicates to me that this is now a very very hot sector when things like that

</details>

**发言人**: 您认为我们正处于 **AI** 泡沫中的论据是什么？反之，我们不在 **AI** 泡沫中的论据又是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: What would be your argument for the fact that we're in an AI bubble and then against the fact that we're in

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，我认为，关于 **AI** 泡沫，你会关注估值、所有权和供应商融资方面的循环性，以及新闻报道。你还会关注当他们在餐厅吃鸡肉时发生的事情。你只是观察一个行业有多么泡沫化。另一方面，它对我们的生活方式产生了巨大的影响。我们公司通过更多地利用 **AI**，生产力可能提高了 **20%**。我们只是尽可能地将其融入到各个方面，它正在产生巨大的影响。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: well I think um okay AI bubble you would look at things like valuations you'd look at circularity in terms of ownership and and uh vendor financing uh these type of things. um you'd look at uh news coverage uh you look at things like what happens when they eat chicken at a restaurant. So you just kind of just look at how frothy a sector is. On the other side it has huge um ramifications for how we live our lives and we see in our firm we are increasing productivity probably by 20% just by utilizing it more and we're just stuffing it in wherever we can and it's making a huge impact.

</details>

**主持人**: 生产力的提高是如何体现的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How does that show up the increase in productivity?

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，它体现在我们用同样的人力做更多的事情。我们现在保持人员数量不变，但我们生产更多，质量也更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Well, we it shows up um in that we do more with the same amount of people. You know, we have we are keeping headcount now flat and we are just producing more and producing better quality.

</details>

**主持人**: 您认为什么会导致通货膨胀卷土重来？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What do you think would cause inflation to come back?

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，世界经济放缓，**AI** 带来更高的生产力增益，以及人形机器人，也就是机器人技术的更多使用，这只是更便宜的劳动力供应。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Um slower world economy, you know, AI leading to more productivity gains. uh humanoids so increased use of robotics which is just a cheaper labor supply.

</details>

**主持人**: **AI** 现在在公司做决策吗？还是说...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Is AI making decisions now at the firm or is it

</details>

**发言人**: 不，我们始终有人类参与其中，但它正在帮助我们，支持我们的决策。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: No, we are there is always a human in the loop but it's helping us. It's supporting our decision- making.

</details>

**主持人**: 您认为它会取代人类在投资中的作用吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Do you think it'll ever replace humans in investing?

</details>

**发言人**: 我不认为会在我们这里。但在某些地方，显然有很多地方已经有完全自动化的投资模型。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: I uh not in our place. Um but clearly in some places right you have uh fully automated uh investment models in a lot of places.

</details>

### AI时代所需技能

**主持人**: 您认为在 **AI** 世界中，哪些技能会变得更重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What skills do you think will matter more in an AI world?

</details>

**发言人**: 人际交往能力，也就是与人沟通、倾听和同理心的能力。我的意思是，这些东西一直都很重要，但它们现在变得更加重要。我只是在很多地方都看到了这一点，这真的很有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Interpersonal skills uh the ability to talk to people, the ability to listen and uh empathy. I mean these these things have always been important but they are just even more important you know and I'm just I'm just seeing it. so many places. It's really really interesting.

</details>

**主持人**: 您在 **沃顿商学院**（**Wharton**）的毕业典礼演讲中提到了倾听的能力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: You talked about uh the ability to listen, I think, in your uh Wharton commencement speech.

</details>

**发言人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Yep.

</details>

**主持人**: 您会如何教导别人做到这一点？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Um how would you teach somebody to do that?

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，这很难。我的意思是，它可以被教导，你可以指出人们总是在说话而不倾听。所以你可以这样说，但我认为我们通常会回到我们本来的样子。我认为这需要一些好奇心，因为如果你不好奇，你就不会倾听。所以，我认为这与好奇心是相辅相成的。我的意思是，一般来说，你应该倾听两倍于你说话的时间，这就是你长了两只耳朵的原因。这非常重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Well, that's a tough one. Um I mean, it can be taught in that you can point it out to people that they talk all the time and they don't listen, right? So, you can say that, but I think we we would fall back to how we are generally. Um, and I think it needs to come with some curiosity because if you're not curious, you're not going to listen. So, I think it goes it goes hand inhand with that. I mean, generally you should listen twice as much as you speak, right? That's why you got two ears and um but um it's super important.

</details>

**主持人**: 很多人认为自己在倾听，但他们实际上并没有在倾听。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: A lot of people think they're listening, but they're not actually listening.

</details>

**发言人**: 是的，他们只是在处理信息，迫不及待地想问下一个问题。所以，很少有人真正倾听。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Yeah. They're just processing stuff and can't wait to get to the next questions themselves, you know? So there is there is little listening.

</details>

### 社会挑战与开放经济

**发言人**: 我曾与一位名叫 **索尔·珀尔马特**（**Saul Perlmutter**）的科学家交谈，他获得了诺贝尔物理学奖。他说：“尼古拉，我们现在正处于一个世界阶段，我们第一次能够解决所有问题。我们知道如何解决气候问题，我们知道如何养活世界上所有人。我们拥有技术，我们拥有科学。只是我们不互相交流，我们不倾听，我们不恰当地合作。”所以，这就是为什么我们需要深入探讨。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Um I um I spoke to this guy called Saul Pearlmutter. He is a scientist. He got the Nobel Prize in physics. And uh he said uh Nikolai we are now at the stage in the world where we for the first time can solve all the problems. We can solve all the problems. We we know how to solve the climate problem. We know how to feed everybody in the world. We have the technology. we have the science. It's just that we don't talk to each other. We don't listen. We don't work together properly. So that's why we need to zoom in. I think

</details>

**主持人**: 您会说这是社会上最大的问题吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: would you say that's the biggest problem in society?

</details>

**发言人**: 我认为现在最大的问题之一是，我们封闭起来了。如果你看看我们经历过的黄金时代，看看那些年我们拥有的真正权力，比如罗马、威尼斯、宋朝、荷兰，这些地方都做得非常好，它们是开放经济体，实行自由贸易，劳动力、思想等自由流动。而这些黄金时代结束时的共同点是，自由贸易的关闭、关税、移民的结束、自由思想的结束、强人政治的崛起，以及对各种自由的攻击。我们正在世界许多地方看到这种情况，这是负面的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: I think one of the biggest problem now is um is the fact that we we close up you know we um if you look at the golden if you look at the golden ages we've had and you look at you know the real powers we've had during the years you know Rome Venice uh the Song Dynasty the Netherlands you know these these places which did really really well they were open economies free trade um free movement of uh labor thought and so on. And what has what they all have in common in terms of the end of the golden ages is uh close of free trades, tariffs, um end of immigration, end of free thought, the rise of the strong man, uh attack on you know freedoms of all types of sorts. And we are seeing that in many places of the world. And uh and that's a native.

</details>

**主持人**: 这些问题中，哪个最让您担忧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Which one of those concerns you the most?

</details>

**发言人**: 以上所有。对我来说，是言论自由。这似乎是最大的限制因素。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: All the above. For me, it's free speech. It's like that seems to be the big limiter.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的，但你需要新的想法，你需要振兴国家和社会。但显然言论自由很重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. But you need you need new ideas, you know, you need to rejuvenate countries and societies. But clearly free speech is important.

</details>

### 美欧心态差异与抱负

**主持人**: 您如何看待美国和欧洲思维方式的差异？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How do you see the difference between American and European mindsets?

</details>

**发言人**: 这非常有趣。我现在在纽约待了一个月，这里的能量、创业精神和动力真是令人惊叹。我住在这里就充满了活力。抱负水平非常高。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: So, this is super interesting, right? Um, uh, and now I'm in New York for a month and, you know, wow, the energy here, uh, the entrepreneurship, the drive, you know, I just get so much energy just living here. Uh, level of ambitions super high.

</details>

**发言人**: 而欧洲，我的意思是，欧洲也是一个很棒的地方，但原因不同。在文化上，它令人难以置信，许多地方的食物也很好，但抱负较少。我认为抱负这件事非常有趣：如果你有非常非常高的抱负，即使失败也能成就大事；如果你抱负不高，即使成功也一无所获。所以，拥有远大抱负真是太棒了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: uh versus Europe where there is I mean Europe is a fantastic place too right but for different reasons um culturally uh incredible uh food pretty good in many places but less ambitions you know the thing with ambitions I think it's so interesting if you have really really high ambitions you achieve great things even if you fail if you have low ambitions you achieve nothing even if you succeed and so having great ambitions is just fantastic

</details>

**发言人**: 在美国，五，我的意思是，你认为五是个大数字还是小数字？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: And you know in in America five I mean do you think five is a high number or a low number

</details>

**主持人**: 针对什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: for what?

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，就一般而言，数字五是高还是低？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Well just generally number is number five high

</details>

**主持人**: 低。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: low.

</details>

**发言人**: 这就对了。你觉得五是低？好的。你问一个欧洲人，五是高还是低？他们会说相当高。所以，增长率、抱负等等的整个概念是不同的。当然，在美国你工作更努力。我的意思是，这不仅仅是我的想法，这是事实。你假期更少等等。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Well there you go. You think you think five is low? Okay. You asking you know a European is five high or low? They would say it's pretty high. So it's just like and so the whole concept of you know growth rates ambitions and so on is different. And then of course you work much harder in America. I mean that's just not something I think. It's just like the facts. you got less holiday uh and so on.

</details>

**主持人**: 您认为这是好事还是坏事？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Do you think that it's good or bad?

</details>

**发言人**: 我认为两者兼有。我认为这对社会某些方面有好处，但对参与其中的人来说就不那么好了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: I think it's both. I think it's good for um some things in society and I think it's not so good for the people involved.

</details>

**主持人**: 这很有趣，因为如果你从进化的角度来看，进化并不关心你，它关心的是物种。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It's so interesting because if you think of it from an evolutionary point of view, I mean, evolution doesn't care about you. It cares about the species.

</details>

**发言人**: 所以它会牺牲你，让你为整个单位的利益和生存更努力地工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: And so it would sacrifice you and make you work harder for the good of the the whole unit and the survival of the unit.

</details>

**主持人**: 当您来到沃顿商学院时，有没有感到文化冲击？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Was it a culture shock when you came to Wharton?

</details>

**发言人**: 来沃顿？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: To Wharton?

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**发言人**: 绝对是。绝对是。嗯，你看，在某种程度上，挪威是沃顿的反面。因为在挪威，每个人都应该是一样的。你有一种叫做 **扬特法则**（**Janteloven**）的东西，就是说不要以任何方式、形式或形状认为自己很了不起。所以你来到这里，我坐在教室里，大家都在问：“嘿，你们想在生活中实现什么？”我的一个同学举手说：“你想做什么？”我说：“我只想征服世界。”这种说法在沃顿是完全正常的，但在我来自的地方，这并不特别正常。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Absolutely. Absolutely. Well, you see the um in a way in Norway is the opposite of Wharton. Um because in Norway everybody's supposed to be the same. You have this thing called Yantelovven. It's just like don't don't think you are fantastic in any way, shape or form. Uh so you come to I sit there in a class and it's just like hey what do you guys want to achieve in life? And one one of the my fellow students just hands up what do you want to do? I just want to conquer the world. And that's kind of a statement which is totally normal,

</details>

**主持人**: 您会如何改变它以增加更多的抱负？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: you know, at Wharton, but it's not particularly normal in where I'm from. How would you change that to add more ambition?

</details>

**发言人**: 我不认为你能改变它。你不能改变一个国家，但你可以在自己的公司里改变它，你可以在你工作的公司里努力改变企业文化，你也可以在自己、家人和朋友身上改变它。但要改变整个国家的抱负水平，我不认为你能做到。这很难。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: I don't think you can change it. You can't you can't change a you can't change a nation, but you can change it in your own company, and you can work on the corporate culture, in the firm you work, and you can change it with yourself and your family and your friends. But to change the ambition level of a whole country, I don't think you can do that. It's tough.

</details>

**主持人**: 如果这是您的任务，您会如何着手？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How would you go about it if you had to if that was your task?

</details>

**发言人**: 好的。我从不涉足政治，因为我的工作完全不政治。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Okay. So, I never do politics because my job is is totally not political.

</details>

**主持人**: 但如果我能当一天首相，而您的唯一任务就是抱负，没有别的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: But if I were like uh prime minister for a day and your only job just ambition, nothing sort of like

</details>

### AI赋能国家发展

**发言人**: 我会把 **AI** 注入到各个领域。我会全力以赴。我会做他们在 **80** 年代瑞典所做的事情，他们有一个叫做“家用电脑”的项目，在一个当时大约 **6、7** 百万人口的国家里，他们购买了 **80** 万台电脑，把它们放在人们的家里，这极大地提高了国家的数字化水平。所以现在你有了 **Spotify**、**Klarna** 等等。这是否直接相关？可能不是。但他们提高了数字化水平。现在他们正在用 **AI** 做同样的事情。现在他们在冰岛也做同样的事情。冰岛刚刚宣布与 **Anthropic** 合作，他们基本上会将 **AI** 引入所有学校等等。我认为这非常适合挪威，一个高度数字化的国家，人们认为拥有大量空闲时间是件好事，当然 **AI** 会帮助你实现这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: I would I would inject AI everywhere. Um I would I would just go all in. I would do what they did you know in Sweden in the 80s they had something called home PC so they bought 800,000 PCs in a country of I don't know at that stage let's say it was 67 million or something eight um put them in people's homes and it just increased the digitalization of the country so now you have you know Spotify cla all these things so is it directly linked no probably not but you know they they increase the digitization now they're doing the same thing with AI now they're doing the same in Iceland in Iceland they are they just did a they announced a cooperation project with um uh with Antropics where they're basically going to stuff it in to all the schools and all that kind of thing and I think it should be perfect for Norway. high highly digitalized country and where people think it's pretty nice to have a lot of spare time and of course AI helps you with that

</details>

**发言人**: 这是一生中难得的机会。如果你读过关于 **英伟达**（**Nvidia**）和 **黄仁勋**（**Jensen Huang**）的书，他谈到这是一生中难得的机会。这对于个人、公司和国家来说，都是一个千载难逢的机会，可以拉开差距。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: and it's a once you know you you read the book uh about uh Nvidia for instance and Yensson Huang talks about this once in a lifetime opportunity and this is just a once in a-lifetime opportunity for people companies and countries to pull apart

</details>

**主持人**: 如果你不这样做，你就会被甩在后面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: and if you don't do that you're sort of going to be left behind if people

</details>

**主持人**: 有两所学校，我想 **Alpha School** 是其中之一，他们正在使用 **AI** 将课程时间缩短到每天两小时。学生们获得了巨大的进步。然后 **Synthesis** 的导师通过 **AI** 创建了一个数学程序，我想现在是从幼儿园到八年级或九年级，结果简直是惊人的。他们在三四个月内让孩子们的成绩提高了两个标准差。所以我们已经证明它比老师更好。但阻碍它的会是什么？您认为呢？为什么人们不这样做？反对的理由会是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: There's uh two I mean Alpha School I guess is one of them who's who's using AI to get curriculum down to two hours a day. The students are getting massively better outcomes and then synthesis is tutor has created this math program through I think it's uh kindergarten through grade eight or nine now and the results are like just off the charts. They move kids two standard deviations within like 3 or 4 months. And so we've demonstrated that it's better than teachers. But the impediment to that would be what do you think? Like why wouldn't people do it? What would be the argument against

</details>

**发言人**: 我不知道为什么人们不这样做。他们应该这样做。我的意思是，他们真的应该这样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: I don't know why people would do it. They should do it. I mean they so should do it.

### 信息获取与预测的局限

**主持人**: 您最近关注的最重要的数据是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What's the most important data you look at these days?

</details>

**发言人**: 我没有一两个数据来源。我读了很多报纸，我认为现在世界上发生的事情真是令人难以置信的着迷，活着真是太令人兴奋了。我早上五点醒来，就迫不及待地起床，开始阅读报纸。然后我开始阅读《**金融时报**》（**Financial Times**）、《**华尔街日报**》（**Wall Street Journal**）、《**纽约时报**》（**New York Times**）等等。现在发生的事情真是令人难以置信，一年前你认为不可能发生的事情现在正在发生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Uh I don't have like just one or two data sources. I read uh just a lot of newspapers and I think what's going on in the world now is just so incredibly fascinating and it's so exciting to be alive, you know, and so I just wake up at 5 and I just spin out of bed. I just can't wait to get out of bed uh to start to read the papers and then I just start, you know, the Financial Times, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, all these things. And wow, the stuff that goes on now is just in incredible things that you didn't think was possible uh a year ago that's now happening, right? Um, so I was up in a

</details>

**发言人**: 几周前，我和七个最好的朋友在森林里，我们预测未来 **12** 个月会发生什么。我们录音了，然后我们播放了去年的预测。这些人真的很聪明，你觉得我们做得怎么样？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: forest um a few weeks ago and um with seven of my best friends and um and we were predicting okay what's going to happen over the next 12 months. So we and we tape it we tape recorded and then we were we were playing our predictions from last year and you know these are really clever people and how do you think we did?

</details>

**发言人**: 糟糕透了。糟糕透了。糟糕透了。我的意思是，我们大约 **80%** 都错了。我们没有预测到几周后 **特朗普** 会赢得选举。我们没有考虑到关税以及美国、欧洲、印度、中国之间的关系。我们一无所知。所以，我认为在这个世界上，试图预测只会越来越没用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. I mean we were like 80% wrong. You know, we didn't we didn't we didn't predict that Trump would win the election a few weeks later. We didn't we didn't think about like tariffs and relationship between the US, Europe, you know, what's going on now in the US in Europe, in India, in China. We had no clue. And so I think trying to predict in this world is just more and more, you know, useless.

</details>

**发言人**: 所以你需要做的就是提高速度和敏捷性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: So what you need to do, you just need to work on speed and agility.

</details>

### 速度、敏捷与紧迫感

**主持人**: 请再深入谈谈这一点。速度和敏捷性有多重要？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Go deeper on that for a second. How important is speed and agility?

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，我对速度非常看重。速度是一种心态。它再次让我感到震惊，回到纽约，我每天早上都会买一个鸡蛋火腿卷，他们打包的速度真是快。我的意思是，纽约的速度非常快，但我认为速度普遍来说非常重要。它涉及到第一性原理：事情不应该花费比所需更长的时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Well, I have a big thing with speed, you know, speed is well, I mean, speed speed is a mindset and it is, you know, um he struck me again going back to New York, you know, I buy this every morning, I buy this uh egg and uh egg and ham roll and just speed with which they wrap it. I mean, my so the speed in New York is very high, but speed generally I think is is super important, you know. Um it comes to this first principle. Things shouldn't take longer than than they need to take. You know um

</details>

**发言人**: 你通过快速行动来节省时间。这听起来可能有点奇怪，但如果你我给你发一封邮件，你在一分钟内回复，那封邮件需要多长？两个字，对吧？我会印象深刻，因为你回复得很快。如果你第二天回复，那封邮件需要多长？一段话。如果你一周后回复，那需要一页纸，对吧？所以你通过快速行动来节省时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: you save time by being fast. So this sounds a bit um strange but you know if you answer if I if I send you an email and you answer within one minute how long does that email need to be? Two two words, right? And I'm impressed because you answer really quickly. If you answer the next day, how long does it have to be? what a paragraph and you answer a week later. It needs to be a page, right? So you so you just save time by being quick.

**主持人**: 您如何看待紧迫感？这是我们讨论美国与欧洲思维方式时没有用到的一个词。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How do you think about urgency? That's one thing we didn't that was not a word we used when we were sort of like thinking about uh American versus European mindsets.

</details>

**发言人**: 是的，我只是认为，我尝试在大多数事情中建立紧迫感。在我的办公室里，我有一个时钟，它倒计时我工作中剩下的天数。这并不是因为我期待停止工作，因为我热爱我的工作，但我墙上挂着这个东西。所以，你进来会说：“嘿，N，我们要处理这个，我会在一月份搞定。”我说：“一月份？看看这里，我还有 **1765** 天。我们现在就需要做！”然后他说：“哦，真的吗？你只剩下 **1765** 天了？好吧，我们现在就做！现在就做！”所以，你就是这样在这些任务中建立紧迫感的。我喜欢它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Yeah, I just think uh urgency is I I try to build urgency into most things. you know, in my office, I have a I have this uh this watch, this kind of clock, and it counts down the number the days I've got left in in my job. So, it's not because I look forward to to stop working because I I love my job, but I have this thing on the wall. And so, you come in and say, "Hey, N, we we're going to work on this and um do you know, I'll I'll sort it by January." And I said, "January, look here. I've got 1,765 days left. We need to do it now." And then he said, "Oh, really? you only have 1,765 days left. Yeah, let's do it now. Let's do it now. So, you just you build urgency into these tasks. I love it.

</details>

**主持人**: 我喜欢这个想法。这真是个好主意。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I like that. That's a really good idea.

</details>

### 投资中的固执与变通

**主持人**: 当我与 **查理·芒格**（**Charlie Munger**）谈论预测时，他基本上说：“那是愚蠢的差事。最好是定位并保持敏捷，但你也必须将其与固执结合起来。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: When I was talking with Charlie Mer about predicting, and he basically said, "It's a fool's errand. It's better to position and have agility, but you kind of have to mix that with a stubbornness, too."

</details>

**发言人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 您对此有何看法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How do you think about that?

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，我认为在投资中最重要的是，你需要固执，但你需要有改变主意的能力。很少有人能做到这一点。像 **斯坦·德鲁肯米勒**（**Stan Druckenmiller**）这样的人有，但这种结合是罕见的。你需要固执才能与众不同。当你进行这种逆向投资时，会有一些时期一切都与你作对，这很有压力，但你需要坚持下去。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Um so I think the most important thing to have in investing is you need to be stubborn but you need to have the ability to change your mind. Very few people have that. Um somebody like Stan Rick and Miller has it but the combination is rare. You need to be stubborn in order to do the opposite of everybody else. Um and when you are when you do these kind of contrarian investing investments uh there will be periods where everything goes against you and it's stressful but you need to hang in there.

</details>

**主持人**: 您认为可以教人们改变主意吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Do you think you can teach people to change their minds?

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，我认为在一定程度上可以教他们。我认为随着年龄的增长会更容易，因为你见过更多的周期。但现在很难找到真正逆向思维的人，因为你需要生活在一个人们不认同你的空间里。我们现在这个世界，每个人都希望被喜欢，希望在 **Facebook** 上获得 **100** 个赞或类似的东西。所以，与众不同是很难的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Um I think you can to a certain extent you can teach them. It's um easier as you get older I think because you've seen more cycles. But it's difficult to find people who are really contrarian now because it's you need to you need to live in a in a space where you are where people don't agree with you and we you know in in today's world everybody wants to be liked and you know have 100 like likes on Facebook or whatever and so to be to be different from other people is is tough. So now when I have

</details>

**发言人**: 所以现在当我在大学做演讲时，我问大家：“嘿，这里有没有人想法与众不同，觉得自己有点怪异，没有人理解他们，请举手。”通常不到 **10%** 的人会举手。我说：“你们很棒，我们很乐意雇用你们。其他人可以举手吗？”然后另外 **90%** 的人就会说：“抱歉，你们和大家没什么两样，永远赚不了多少钱。”但还是有希望的，你可以改变。我希望人们走出那个房间时会想：“我想要与众不同。”这是我们应该真正珍惜和喜爱的东西。我的意思是，与众不同是好事，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: when I give presentations at universities, I I ask people, hey, anybody here who thinks differently from other people who kind of think that they are weird, that they that nobody understands them, hands up. So typically less than 10%. I said, you guys, you're great. We'd love to hire you. Can everybody else put a hands up? And then the other 90% is like, you know, sorry guys, you're just like everybody else. You're never going to make much money, but there is hope. you can change, you know, and I I kind of think people hopefully they go out of that room and think, you know what, I want to be different, you know. It's something we should really treasure and and love. I, you know, wear it is good, right?

</details>

**主持人**: 再深入谈谈这一点，我的意思是，很多人优化他们的生活，不一定是为了被喜欢，但肯定是为了不被讨厌或不喜欢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Go deeper on that for a second in terms of I think a lot of people optimize their lives not necessarily to be liked, but definitely not be, you know, hated or disliked by people

</details>

**发言人**: 而这导致了所有这些奇怪的社会扭曲。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: and that causes all these weird societal distortions.

</details>

**发言人**: 是的，你不需要被讨厌，即使人们不认同你。但在我看来，生活不是一场人气竞赛。我妻子说，只有没有朋友的人才会这么说，但我不这么认为。我认为生活肯定不是一场人气竞赛。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Yeah. you you don't have to be disliked even though you dis you you know people disagree with you but you know in my in my mind life is not a popularity contest so my wife says that well only people without friends say that but I don't I don't think so I think you life is for sure not the popularity contest and

</details>

**主持人**: 您肯定不会一直受欢迎，屏幕上显示着那个大数字。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: you're definitely not popular all the time you have that big number on the screen

</details>

**发言人**: 你不能一直受欢迎，你必须习惯这样一个事实：即使你只有 **10%** 的人会不同意你的观点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: you can't you know you can't be popular all the time and you have to you know you have to be used to the fact that whatever even if you're by 10% will disagree with you.

</details>

**主持人**: 您会阅读那些对您不利的评论吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Do you read the comments that are negative about you?

</details>

**发言人**: 不。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: No.

</details>

**主持人**: 您会阅读吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Do you read?

</details>

**发言人**: 但我也不读正面的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: But I also I also don't read the positives.

</details>

**主持人**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Okay.

</details>

**发言人**: 我也不相信它们。我既不相信正面的，也不相信负面的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: And I don't believe them. You know, I don't believe the positives. I don't believe the negatives.

</details>

### 客观真相与盲点

**主持人**: 那么当您阅读报纸时，您是如何阅读的？您是阅读标题，如果它吸引您，您就阅读文章，还是有不同的浏览或处理方式？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So when you read the newspapers, like how do you read them? Are you reading headlines and then if it catches you, you read the article or is there a different way that you skim or process that?

</details>

**发言人**: 我阅读标题，然后如果是我感兴趣的事情，或者我知道我应该了解更多的事情，我就会深入阅读。或者如果我要见某个对该领域感兴趣的人，或者我知道有人感兴趣，我就会把信息传递给他们。或者如果我见过这个人，或者邀请他上我们的播客。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: I read I go through headlines and then I drill down if it's either something I am interested in or something I know I should know more about uh or if I'm going to meet somebody who's interested in that particular field or I know somebody who's interested then I pass it on to somebody else or if I've met the person uh or had him on our podcasts.

</details>

**主持人**: 在进行重大投资之前，您如何检验自己的假设？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How do you test your assumptions before making a big investment?

</details>

**发言人**: 我认为我们可以在这方面做得更好，我认为我们可以发展这一点。通过更多地使用科学方法，我认为我们可以做得更好。我确实认为存在一种客观真理。我认为有些东西是正确的，我们需要找到它。所以，我现在比过去更加开放。我认为我听取了更多不同类型的意见和观点，我尽量不急于下结论。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: So that's where we that's where I think we can be better and I think we can develop this and I think the by using more of a scientific method um I think we can be better and I do think that there is I I think there is something called I think there is an objective truth. I think there is something which is correct and we need to we need to find it and um so I have much more of an open mind now than I had in the past. I I think I listen to more different types of input and opinions and I try not to jump to conclusion.

</details>

**主持人**: 根据回报来看，这让您成为一个更好的投资者还是更差的投资者？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Has that made you a better or worse investor based on returns?

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，我现在自己不管理资金。我管理着一家公司，我们有很多人在管理资金。但毫无疑问，如果你将更多不同的意见纳入考量，你肯定会成为一个更好的投资者。如果你做多某物，你会听取做空者的意见，反之亦然。我的意思是，真的存在一个真相，你不觉得吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Well, so so I I don't run money myself now. I'm you know running a a company where we have a lot of people running money. But for sure it's going to make you a better investor if you take more uh of the different opinions into into the equation. If you are long something, you listen to the shorts you and vice versa. I mean, there really is a truth, you know. Don't you think?

</details>

**主持人**: 您认为存在客观真理吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Do you think there is an objective truth?

</details>

**发言人**: 我希望是这样。是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: I would like to think so. Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**发言人**: 是的，我认为是这样。但我们如何才能找到那个真相呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Yeah. I think that that's But how do we get at that truth is the

</details>

**发言人**: 倾听不同类型的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: listening to different types of people.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。但那样的话，你在某个时候会做出判断，关于什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. But then you're you're making a judgment call at some point on what

</details>

**发言人**: 什么更接近真相，什么不是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: what's closer to the truth and what's not.

</details>

**发言人**: 当然。然后你必须将其与分析和模式识别联系起来，希望能找到正确的东西。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Of course. And then you have to kind of uh well then you link in analysis and you know some pattern recognition and and so on and hopefully you get to something which is correct.

</details>

**主持人**: 我认为我们大多数糟糕决策的根源只是盲点。我们缺少信息。有些东西我们看不到。有些东西，而我们的工作就是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I think the the source of most of our poor decisions is just blind spots. There's information we're missing. There's something we don't see. There's something and our job is to um

</details>

**发言人**: 减少我们的盲点。我不知道我们是否能完全消除它们，但我们肯定可以减少它们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: reduce our blind spots. I don't know if we can completely eliminate them but we can definitely reduce it.

</details>

**发言人**: 是的。然后我们通过与人交谈和获得不同视角来减少它。这就像你我站在这里，你拍了一张照片，我拍了一张照片。这两张照片都是 **100%** 准确的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Yep. And then we reduce it through talking to people and getting different perspectives. And it's just like if you and I were standing beside each other right here and you took a photo and I took a photo. Both of those photos are 100% accurate.

</details>

**主持人**: 但如果我们将它们加在一起，我们就能得到比单独看更多的画面，因为它会略有不同，因为我们站在略微不同的角度，有不同的偏移。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: But if we add them together, we get more of a picture than we do individually because it'll be slightly different because we're standing at slightly different angles with different offsets.

</details>

**发言人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Y

</details>

### 风险偏好与投资策略

**主持人**: 您对风险的态度有何改变？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How is your attitude towards risk changed?

</details>

**发言人**: 这很难说。我可能在某些方面变得更加规避风险。另一方面，我现在可能比过去承担更多的某些风险。所以，人们的风险偏好取决于很多因素。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: It's um it it's a difficult one. I amum probably in some ways become more risk averse. On the other hand, there are some risks I probably take more of now than I did in the past. Right? So the risk people's risk appetite uh depends on many things.

</details>

**发言人**: 我的意思是，在其他条件相同的情况下，男性比女性承担更多风险，这就是为什么我们更容易撞车。年轻人比老年人承担更多风险。外向者比内向者承担更多风险。这与地理位置有关，对吧？美国人比亚洲人承担更多风险。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Um I mean everything else being equal, men take more risk than women, which is why we crash our cars much more, right? Um young take more than older people. Extroverts take more than introverts. It's geographically based, right? American people take more risks than let's say Asian people.

</details>

**发言人**: 我很抱歉，这不是我发明的。因为我学过社会心理学，我的一篇论文正是关于这个：风险偏好如何与“大五人格”相关联。所以，平均而言，随着年龄的增长，你承担的风险会少一些，但随着财富的积累，有时你会承担更多风险。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Um, and I'm sorry, I'm not I'm not the one who has invented this, okay? Because I I did a degree in social psychology and one of my papers was on exactly this is just how is risk appetite linked to the big five, you know? And uh so as you get older on average you take a bit less risk but as you also as you build wealth you take a bit more risk sometimes.

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，我很抱歉，这是一个很长的回答。我不确定我这里有一个非常明确的答案。所以风险很有趣，对吧？然后你和一些人交谈。比如说你做私募股权投资，你采访了像 **史蒂夫·施瓦茨曼**（**Steve Schwarzman**）这样的人，我们在播客中也采访过他。他说：“好的，不亏钱真的很重要。”所以你需要真正关注下行风险。而在风险投资中，你是否在很多事情上亏钱并不重要，只要你抓住了真正的大赢家就行。所以你可以十次中输掉九次，只要你抓住了那一次，它就像火箭一样飞速上涨。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Um so I don't I'm sorry this was a long answer. I'm not sure I have a very clear answer here. So risk is interesting right? So then you talk to some people. So in so let's say you do private equity and you interview somebody like Steve Schwarzman which we did on our podcast right? So like okay it's really important not to lose money. So you need to really look at the downside. Now in venture capital, it doesn't matter whether you lose money on a lot of stuff as long as you capture the really big winners, right? So you can lo you can lose nine out of 10 as long as you get the one, right, which is just like going up like a rocket.

</details>

**发言人**: 这里的问题是，过去火箭的入场券是 **100** 万美元，现在不是 **5** 亿美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: The the issue here is that the rocket the the entry ticket for the rocket which was $1 million in the past, that's not like $500 million.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**发言人**: 所以那枚火箭最好能飞上去，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: So that rocket better go up, right?

</details>

**主持人**: 你们主要做的是指数增强型投资。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And you guys do mostly it's like index plus.

</details>

**发言人**: 是的，我们非常注重指数。我们从财政部长那里得到了一个非常棒的投资授权。它告诉我们大致应该如何定位。它给了我们一个风险预算，然后我们非常接近这个预算。这对于很多事情都很重要，但它也很重要，因为它限制了我们可能亏损的金额。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Yeah, we are we are we are very index there. We got a very uh we got a really great investment mandate from the minister of finance. It tells us how we're going to be how roughly how we are going to be positioned. It gives us a risk budget and then we are pretty close to that and that's that's important for many things but it's also important because it limits how much money we can lose.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么这在实践中是如何运作的呢？你基本上是从指数的 **100%** 开始，然后说：“好吧，我们少投一点这个，多投一点那个。”是这样吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So how does that work in practice? you you basically like start with 100% in the index and then you're like okay well we're going to take a little less of this and a little more of that or

</details>

**发言人**: 是的，差不多。所以，我会说我们有 **20%** 的活跃资金，我们会以非常积极的方式运作，而其他部分的资金会进行较小的调整。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: yeah pretty much right so we would have I would say we have 20% of the active 20% of the capital we would run in a very active way and the other one the other part of the capital will do smaller tweaks

</details>

**主持人**: 但我猜你们每年都有大量资金流入，可能在 **1000** 亿美元左右，甚至更多。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: but you you have a lot of money coming in every year I would imagine it's probably on the order of a 100 billionish if not more

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，这取决于能源价格，但通常都有资金流入。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: well it's um it depends on energy prices but uh generally there's been inflows

</details>

**主持人**: 那么，您会如何分配这些新流入的资金呢？无论价格如何，比如现在，前七大股票占美国指数的 **46%**。您是直接将其投入指数，还是？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And so do you take that and you no matter what the price is like say today where you have uh the top seven stocks account for 46% of the US index do you just how do you allocate that new money coming in do you just sort of like pop it into the index or

</details>

**发言人**: 有点像。我们每月都会收到资金流入或流出。所以你在特定的一天收到钱，然后你必须考虑何时将其投入市场。你是提前一点，还是之后一点，或者之前和之后都做一点。我们使用 **AI** 来优化这些决策。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: kind of we get we get uh the the the inflows or outflows are they're monthly right so you get the money uh on a particular day and then you have to think when do you deploy it into the market you do it a did bit beforehand or a bit afterwards or you know bit before and after and we use AI to optimize those type of decisions.

</details>

**主持人**: 您会尝试抢先指数变动吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Do you try to frontr run index changes?

</details>

**发言人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 我想是使用 **AI** 吧。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Using AI I would imagine.

</details>

**发言人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 投资中什么变得更难了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What's gotten harder in investing?

</details>

**发言人**: 一切。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Everything.

</details>

**主持人**: 没有什么变得更容易了吗？不。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Nothing's gotten easier. No,

</details>

**发言人**: 一切都变得更难了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: everything's gotten harder.

</details>

**发言人**: 不，我的意思是，一切都变得更难了。我会说，研究变得更容易了。因为一些模型中的深度研究功能，你可以在 **5** 秒内获得令人难以置信的海量知识。以前你需要花费很长时间才能做到这一点，而且现在结构良好，你可以随意操作。所以，我的意思是，这简直是惊人的。简直是惊人的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: No, I mean everything has gone harder. I would say what's getting getting easier is research, right? uh because of the deep research functions in some of the models you get incredible incredible amount of knowledge within within 5 seconds. It would take you ages to do that before and it's well structured and it's um and you can play around with it and so that's I mean that's just phenomenal. It's just phenomenal.

</details>

### 投资研究与被动投资

**主持人**: 您如何看待被动投资在散户中的兴起？它的优缺点是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How do you think about the rise of passive investing when it comes to retail? What are the pros and cons of that?

</details>

**发言人**: 优点是它更便宜，所以人们不需要支付那么多费用。很难跑赢市场。缺点是，我的意思是，它们通常会助长泡沫，因为随着被动资金的增加，它们会进入那些历史上表现良好的股票，从而助长这些走势。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Well, the pros is that it's cheaper, so people don't pay that much fees. It's difficult to beat the market. Um, the natives is that you will, I mean, they would typically perpetuate uh bubbles because with more passive money, they go into, you know, stocks which have done historically well and they perpetuate uh the moves.

</details>

**主持人**: 您的目标是主动回报，还是总回报、绝对回报，或者是相对于指数的回报？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Is your goal active return like a active um or total return absolute return or is it sort of relative to the index?

</details>

**发言人**: 相对于指数。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Relative relative to the ind.

</details>

**发言人**: 所以我们是根据财政部构建的参考指数来衡量的，然后我们尝试超越它。从历史上看，在过去近 **30** 年里，我们有 **25** 个基点的表现。所以你会说：“嘿，这不算多。”但问题是，如果你有很多钱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: So we are measured against a reference index which is uh constructed by the ministry and then we try to beat that. Historically over the last close to 30 years we've had 25 basis points of performance. So you would say hey that's not so much. Well, the thing is that if if you have a lot of money,

</details>

**主持人**: 这些数字最终会变得相当大，我的意思是，绝对金额相当大。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: it's these are pretty they it ends up being pretty big uh you know absolute uh amounts.

</details>

### 投资失误与经验教训

**主持人**: 在那之前，当您管理自己的基金时，您犯过的最糟糕的投资错误是什么？发生了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And when you were running your own fund before that, what was the the worst sort of investing mistake that you made and what happened?

</details>

**发言人**: 最糟糕的错误发生在金融危机期间。我们投资了一家次级抵押贷款机构，结果发现存在会计欺诈。这是一个很大的头寸，那是我做过的最糟糕的投资。我学到的是，你不想涉足可疑的商业模式。所以，布莱恩，你可以说，这并不是我们投资的那种公司。我的意思是，向生活困难的人放贷是否道德？我不知道。但那肯定是一项非常糟糕的投资。我现在不会投资那种公司。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: The worst mistake was during the financial crisis. We were in a subprime lender and it turned out that there was accounting fraud and um it was a big position and that's that's the worst that's the worst investment I've ever made. Uh and what I learned was that um you don't want to go into dubious business models. And so Brian, you can say, you know, it's not really um certainly the type of company we're invested, I I would say it's not really I mean, is it ethical to lend money to people who are in a tough situation in life? Well, I don't know. It certainly was a really bad investment. I wouldn't invest in that type of company. Now,

</details>

**主持人**: 您从中学到了什么？是商业模式的问题吗？还是？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: what would you like? What was the lesson you took away from that? Is it the business model? Is it the

</details>

**发言人**: 这只是商业模式的问题，我只是不想，我只是不认为你应该从那些处境艰难的人身上获利。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: it's just a business model and it's just I I just don't want to I just don't think you should profit from people who have a tough time.

</details>

**主持人**: 如果您要反驳自己，反驳的论点会是什么？我的意思是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What would be the counterargument to that if you were to argue with yourself? I mean

</details>

**发言人**: 我不认为有什么好的反驳论点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: I don't think there's a I don't think there's a good counter argument.

</details>

**主持人**: 反驳会是，也许我在这里扮演一下魔鬼的代言人，但难道不是所有人都需要信贷吗？我们都曾运气不佳，也许我们的信用评级不是最好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: The push back would Wouldn't it be like maybe I'll play devil's advocate here for a second, but wouldn't it be that people uh all need credit? We've all been down on our luck and maybe we don't have the best credit rating and

</details>

**发言人**: 但这只是你如何做，如何处理，以及你收取多少费用。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: but it's just how you do it and how you go about it and what you charge for it.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**发言人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 肯定不应该是高利贷。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: It shouldn't be sort of user rates for sure.

</details>

**发言人**: 不。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: No.

</details>

**主持人**: 您在那之后做过事后分析吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Um did you do a postmortem after that?

</details>

**发言人**: 完全做了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Totally.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么，在您在那次投资中损失了大量资金之后，您是如何重拾信心，再次大胆出手的呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And then how do you have the confidence to sort of come back and take big swings after you lo like you lost a lot of money on that one.

</details>

**发言人**: 因为只要你不犯同样的错误。我的意思是，既然有那么多错误可以吸取教训，为什么要犯同样的错误呢？你应该去发现一些新的错误。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Because you as long as you don't do the same mistake. I mean, why why why make the same mistakes when there are so many mistakes to take from, you know, you find some new ones.

</details>

**主持人**: 那是原创性和错误。我喜欢它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: That's originality and mistakes. I love it.

</details>

### 心理韧性与风险承担

**发言人**: 嗯，但你知道，风险承担真的很有趣。大多数人在亏钱时会承担更少的风险。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Um, but you know, Okay. So, so the risk taking is really interesting. So, most people take less risk when they lose money.

</details>

**主持人**: 嗯。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Mhm.

</details>

**发言人**: 即使你应该承担相同数量的风险。所以，我们在这里使用了一位运动心理学家。我以前航海，年轻时参加了很多比赛。我曾与一些英国奥运帆船运动员一起航海，他们真的非常非常出色。所以我问他们：“嘿，你们为什么这么出色？”他们说：“嗯，我们有两个原因。第一，我们有一个非常棒的复盘系统；第二，我们与运动心理学家合作，训练心理素质。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Even though you should take the same amount of risk. So, here we use a sports psychologist. I I sail and I did a lot of competition when I was a bit younger. And I sailed with some of the British Olympic sailors and they were just really really good, right? And so I asked them, hey, why are you so good? Well, you know, we we have two reasons. One, we have a very uh great we got a really good debrief system and also we work with sports psychologist, you know, to work with mental type of uh you know, strength.

</details>

**发言人**: 所以在帆船运动中，重要的是，你可能是第一名，然后风向一变，你突然就成了最后一名。下一场比赛，你需要承担相同类型的风险，你不能让它影响你。投资也是如此，仅仅因为你亏损了，你需要重新振作起来，承担相同数量的风险。这非常困难，这就是为什么你需要一些心理学家来帮助你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: And so what is important in sailing is that you know you can be number one and then the wind the wind direction changes and then suddenly you're you're the last one. Now next race you need to take the same type of risks you know you cannot let it impact you and that's the same way it is with investing you know just because you lost you need to get back on your horse and take the same amount of risk and it's very difficult and that's why you need some psychologist to help you with this

</details>

**发言人**: 我曾与国际象棋棋手 **马格努斯·卡尔森**（**Magnus Carlsen**）做过播客，我问他：“嘿，当你输掉一盘棋时会发生什么？你会承担更多还是更少风险？”他会在下一盘棋中承担更多风险，我觉得这很有趣，但通常人们会承担更少。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: um you know I did a podcast with Magnus Carlson the chess player and so I asked him hey what happens when you when you lost you know a game do you take more less or he takes more risk in the next game which I think is interesting but normally people take less That's

</details>

**主持人**: 这很吸引人，因为我当时在想，最糟糕的人会承担更少或更多风险，因为这难道不是我只是想象这个男人或女人在拉斯维加斯的赌桌上，他们输了，然后继续加倍下注，加倍下注。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: fascinating because I was thinking as you were saying that a little bit that the worst people would take less or more risk because isn't that the I just picture this guy at the or girl I guess or whatever at the gambling table in Vegas and they lose and they keep go you know double down double down double down.

</details>

**发言人**: 投资者不会那样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Investors don't do that.

</details>

### 职业选择与人生意义

**主持人**: 是的。您为什么选择这份工作？您看到了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. Why did you take this job? Like what did you see?

</details>

**发言人**: 您为什么想要它？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Why did you why did you want it?

</details>

**发言人**: 哦，天哪，这是我的梦想工作。我曾经营一家名为 **AKO Capital** 的投资公司，我创立了它，它运作了 **15** 年，我认为是时候把它传给下一代，去做些别的事情了。所以我想回到大学再读一个学位，学习更多东西。在那之前，我刚刚获得了社会心理学和组织发展方面的学位。所以当这份工作出现时，我感觉“哇”，它结合了资产管理。资产管理是生活中最有趣的事情，因为它关乎一切动态的事物，你吃什么，开什么车，所有这些。它关乎心理学，关乎市场，关乎贪婪和恐惧。它关乎宏观经济、地缘政治、国防。它关乎一切，对吧？所以，它是你能构建的最不可思议的游戏。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Oh my it was my it was my it was my dream job. Right. So I had um I had run uh this investing company investment company called AKO Capital set it up and um it kind of turned 15 years and and I thought it was time to pass it on to the next generation and do something else. So I wanted to go back to university and do another degree and uh learn some more more things. And then I had just before that taken a degree in done a degree in in social psychology and uh organizational development. And so when this job came up it was just like wow you know it combines uh you know asset management and asset management is the most interesting thing you can do in life because it's about everything that moves everything you eat where drive all that kind of thing. It's about psychology. It's about markets. It's about greed and fair. It's about macroeconomy geopolitics defense. Uh it it's about everything, right? So So it is it is the most incredible game you could ever construct.

</details>

**发言人**: 然后我就可以把它与组织发展结合起来，真正看看我们是否能把这个组织带到一个前所未有的地方，然后为国家做一些伟大的事情。所以，我所有的兴趣都集中在一份工作中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Then I could combine it with organization development and really see whether we could take this organization, you know, to a place that it hadn't been before and then do something great for the country. So all my interests came together in one job.

</details>

**主持人**: 人们经常谈论产品市场契合度、销售策略或定价策略。但事实是，销售的成功往往归结于更简单的事情，即销售背后的系统。这就是为什么我使用并热爱 **Shopify** 的 **Shopay**，因为没有人比 **Shopify** 更擅长销售。他们建立了地球上排名第一的结账系统。通过 **Shopay**，企业的转化率提高了 **50%**。这不是四舍五入的误差，这是一个改变游戏规则的因素。注意力是稀缺的。**Shopify** 帮助您捕捉并转化它。如果您正在建立一家严肃的企业，您的商务平台需要满足您的客户，无论他们在您的网站上、店内、他们的信息流中，还是直接在他们的收件箱中。他们思考得越少，购买得就越多。销售更多的企业都在 **Shopify** 上销售。如果您认真对待销售，幕后的技术与产品本身一样重要。升级您的业务，并获得我使用的相同结账系统。访问 **shopify.com/knowledgeproject** 注册您的每月 **1** 美元试用期。全部小写。访问 **shopify.com/knowledgeproject** 立即升级您的销售。**Shopify.com/knowledgeproject**。

<details>

**主持人**: People talk a lot about product market fit, sales tactics, or pricing strategy. But the truth is, success in selling often comes down to something much simpler, the system behind the sale. That's why I use and love Shopay, because nobody does selling better than Shopify. They've built the number one checkout on the planet. And with Shopay, businesses see up to 50% higher conversions. That's not a rounding error. That's a gamecher. Attention is scarce. Shopify helps you capture it. and convert it.

### 主权财富基金的成功要素

**主持人**: 我是主权财富基金的忠实拥护者。以您现在的了解，您会如何建议美国或加拿大建立一个主权财富基金？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I'm a huge proponent in sovereign wealth funds. How would you advise the United States or Canada to set one up knowing what you know now?

</details>

**发言人**: 我认为我太谦虚了，无法在这方面给任何人建议。对挪威来说，行之有效的是拥有一个具有广泛政治基础的主权财富基金。所以各政党通常在重大决策上达成一致，这意味着即使政府更迭，你也不会改变基金的运作方式。这很重要。然后是透明度，我们是世界上最透明的基金，实际上有一个世界锦标赛，我们连续三次赢得了冠军。这是一个由一家名为 **SEM** 的加拿大公司在多伦多举办的世界锦标赛。最后一点是，我们有一个支出规则，这意味着政客每年最多只能花费基金的 **3%**。所以，我认为广泛的政治基础、透明度和支出规则，这三个是非常重要的因素。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: I I I I think I'm too too humble to advise anybody uh in that field. What has worked well for Norway is to have a sovereign wealth fund which is has broad political anchoring. So the political parties generally agree on the on the on the big decisions which means that when you have a change of government you do not change the way you run the fund. That's important. Then transparency, we are the most transparent fund in the world and there is actually a world championship in that and we won it three times in a row. Um it's a world championship which has been run by actually a Canadian company called SEM in Toronto. Uh and then the last thing is you have a we have a spending rule which means that um the politicians spend 3% of the fund every year a maximum of 3%. So I think the you know the broad political anchoring the transparency and the spending rule those those are three really important factors.

</details>

**主持人**: 是否存在任何尖锐的政治因素会影响这一点？我猜它会变得政治化。在这一点上，您大概占预算的 **20%** 或 **30%**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Are there any acute sort of um political factors that go into this? I imagine it would become political. You're like 20 or 30% of the budget at this point.

</details>

**发言人**: 是的。该基金占国家预算的 **25%**。嗯，整个想法是该基金不应该政治化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Yeah. The fund is 25% of the state budget. Well the whole idea is that the fund should not be political.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么挪威的政治如何影响您对 **ESG** 等事项的股票投票？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And then how do how does Norway's politics work its way into how you might vote for your shares on things like ESG or uh

</details>

**发言人**: 是的，嗯，那不是政治决定的，那是决定的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: yeah well so that's so that is not politically decided that's decided

</details>

**主持人**: 那是如何决定的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: how is that decided

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，那是我们有一个小组的人坐下来查看投票结果，他们是非常有经验的人。例如，我们查看薪酬方案是否与我们的利益相符？它们是否足够长期？它们是否足够基于股权？诸如此类的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: well that is decided we got a group of people who sit and look at votes right and uh they are very very experienced people so for instance we look at pay packages are they structured in a way which coincide with with the they um I mean are they aligned with our interests? Are they long-term enough? Are they equity based enough? Those kind of things.

</details>

**主持人**: 这些决定会提交给您吗？或者您至少知道那些重要的决定？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Did those decisions come up to you or are you at least aware of the big ones?

</details>

**发言人**: 我知道那些重要的决定，但我故意不在这里做决定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: I am aware of the big ones but I deliberately do not uh make decisions here.

</details>

**主持人**: 投票反对 **埃隆**（**Elon Musk**）的薪酬方案背后的想法是什么？理由是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What was the thinking behind voting against Elon's pay package? Like what was the rationale?

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，团队认为它太大了，而且与股东没有正确的利益一致性。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Um well the team thought it was too too big and uh didn't have the right alignment with shareholders.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**发言人**: 而且它具有稀释性。我们拥有 **9000** 家公司的股份。如果所有首席执行官都获得 **10** 亿美元，那对我们来说会非常昂贵。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Do you think and and the fact that it was dilutive and you know we own we own shares in 9,000 companies. If if all the CEOs were going to have a billion dollars that would be pretty expensive for us.

</details>

**发言人**: 我喜欢把它看作是，你基本上对世界经济征收了近 **2%** 的过路费，或者类似的东西。这样想公平吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: I like to think of it as you basically have a almost a 2% toll on the world economy at this point or something similar. Is that a fair way to think about it?

</details>

**发言人**: 我认为是这样。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: I think so.

</details>

**主持人**: 我个人认为这真的很酷。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I think that's a I think that's really cool personally.

</details>

### 组织变革与沟通策略

**主持人**: 您如何在组织中建立长期思维？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How do you build long-term thinking into the organization?

</details>

**发言人**: 这非常困难，因为人们想要做事。我认为财富基本上是通过拥有一两个真正好的资产，然后长期持有它们来创造的。当你看到那些真正巨大的财富时，基本上就是这样创造的。所以你通过尽可能少地做事情来赚钱，就所有权和所有权股权的变化而言。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: It's very difficult because because people want to do things. Okay. You know, I think wealth wealth is basically created by owning one or two really good assets and then you just hold on to it for the very long term. That's when you when you know you look at the wealth the really big pockets of wealth. That's basically how it has been created. So you make money by doing as little as possible in terms of ownership and change of ownership stakes.

</details>

**发言人**: 但想象一下，你现在是一名投资组合经理。你周一从工作回来，你丈夫问你：“嘿，今天怎么样？你做了什么？”你说：“我什么都没做。”好的。第二天，周二，他说：“嗨，亲爱的。你今天做了什么？”“什么都没做。”周三、周四、周五也是一样，到周末的时候，他说：“嘿，你做了什么吗？”“不，我什么都没做。”这不符合直觉，这并不容易，对吧？所以，很多时候最困难的事情就是什么都不做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: But imagine now you're a portfolio manager. You come home from work on Monday and your husband asks you, "Hey, how how was it today? What did you do?" I did nothing. Okay. And next day, Tuesday, it's like, "Hi, darling. Um, you know, what did you do today?" Nothing. And the same thing on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and it's just like at the end of the week, hey, did you did you do anything? No, I didn't do a thing. It's um it's not intuitive that that's easy, right? So, very often the most difficult thing is not to do anything.

</details>

**发言人**: 所以，看待它的一种方式是我称之为“惯性分析”。这意味着你拿出 **1** 月 **1** 日的投资组合，看看如果我一直坚持下去，没有做任何改变，投资结果会是什么。然后你看看你当年的实际结果，通常你所做的事情实际上会损害你的业绩。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: And so, one way to look at it is what I call the inert inertia analysis. It mean you take you take the portfolio from January Jan one and you and you see what would have been the investment result if I just stuck to that and not made a single change and then you look at your actual results for the year and so often you actually have detracted from your performance by the things you've done.

</details>

**主持人**: 这太对了。长期思考意味着什么？长期思考有哪些要素？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: That is so true. What does it mean to think long term? Like if you were to are there elements to that thinking that go into it?

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，你必须弄清楚你的时间范围是什么，对吧？理想情况下，我们应该用财富基金来思考，我们应该展望 **50** 年。但这很难，因为你根本不知道 **50** 年后世界会是什么样子。我们甚至不知道三年后会是什么样子，这可能是你能展望未来的最大时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Um well, you have to figure out what's your time horizon, right? Ideally, we should be thinking with a wealth fund, we should think 50 years ahead. But that's tough because you haven't got a clue what the world is going to look like in 50 years time. We don't even know what it's going to look like in I would say three years time is probably the max you can you can look into the future.

</details>

**发言人**: 所以，在你所做的事情上，很难做到长期。我知道 **德鲁肯米勒**（**Druckenmiller**）广为人知的是，他先建仓，然后才做研究。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: So, it's very tough to be it's very tough to be long-term in what you do. I know um Draen Miller is widely known to take a position then do research after.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 您也这样做吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Uh do you do that as well or?

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，我确实经常这样做。我认为，你为什么要这样做？首先，如果你的直觉很好，人们不相信直觉。如果你称之为直觉，如果你称之为模式识别，更多人会相信它。但如果你的模式识别很好，你看到了一些看起来非常有趣的东西，那么它成为一个好投资的可能性相当高。好的，这远远超过 **50%**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Well, I did I did that uh quite a lot and I think it's why do you want to do that? Well, um first of all you if your gut feel is good and you know people don't believe in gut feed. If you call it gut feel if you call it pattern recognition more people believe in it. But if your if your pattern recognition is good and you see something that looks really interesting, the probability of that being a good investment is pretty high. Okay, it's like way over 50%.

</details>

**发言人**: 通过建仓，你在研究过程中创造了一些紧迫感，而且如果它上涨，也更容易增加头寸，因为你已经有一些股票了，对吧？所以，这在心理上更容易开始。所以，我支持他的做法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Um, and by taking a position, you create some urgency in the research process and it's also easier to add to add to the position, you know, if it goes up because you already have you already have some shares, right? So, it's just like mentally a bit easier to get going. So, I I was in his camp.

</details>

**主持人**: 您认为可以教授直觉或模式识别吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Do you think you can teach intuition or pattern recognition if you will?

</details>

**发言人**: 不，你不能。但你可以，但你会随着时间获得它。我做了一项研究，当我学习社会心理学时，我采访了欧洲 **20** 位最优秀的资产经理，我问他们关于模式识别的问题，你何时使用它，何时不使用它？首先，如果你称之为直觉，没有人相信它。如果你称之为模式识别，很多人会相信它。你不相信别人的直觉，只相信自己的。你年轻时不能运用它，因为没有人相信它。你不能去对你的老板说：“嘿，你知道吗？我想我们应该买 **1** 亿美元的 **苹果**。”他会说：“好吧，为什么？”“这只是我的直觉。”这行不通，对吧？没有人会听你的。所以你需要相当资深，理想情况下，你希望成为老板，因为如果你是老板，你实际上可以做到，而且它会随着时间变得更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: No, you can't. But you can but you gain it with time. So I did uh I did a research process when I studied social psychology. I interviewed the 20 best asset managers in Europe and I asked them you know about pattern recognition you know when do you when do you use it when don't you use it? Well first of all you call it gutfield nobody believes in it. You call it pattern recognition a lot of people believe in it. You don't believe in anybody else's gut feel only your own. You can't apply it when you're young because nobody believes in it. You can't go to your boss and it's like hey you know what I think we should I think we should just you know buy you know 100 million worth of Apple. It's like okay well why it's just a gut feel I have. It doesn't it doesn't work right? Nobody's going to listen to you. So you need to be pretty senior and ideally you want to be the boss because if you're the boss uh you can actually do it and it gets better over time.

</details>

**发言人**: 所以最好的人会结合使用两者。他们根据情况结合使用模式识别和分析。如果你时间紧迫，你更有可能使用模式识别；如果情况非常复杂，很难量化结果，那么模式识别就更重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: So the best the best people use a combination of the two. They use a combination of pattern recognition and analysis depending on the situation. If you are if you press for time you you are you're more likely to use pattern recognition and if it's a really complex situation where where it's difficult to put numbers on the outcome their pattern recognition is more important.

</details>

**发言人**: 我记得采访 **马格努斯**（**Magnus Carlsen**）时，他说了类似的话，他说他有一种直觉，一种对下一步棋的直观识别。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: I think I remember an interview with Magnus where he said something like that whereas I have an intuition like an intuitive recognition of what move I'm going to make

</details>

**主持人**: 然后有人追问：“为什么你有时需要五分钟才能走一步棋？”他说：“嗯，我在反复检查。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: and then the person the followup was why does it take you like five minutes to move sometimes and he's like well I'm double-checking.

</details>

**发言人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Yeah,

</details>

**发言人**: 我在放慢速度。所以他所做的，根据他告诉我的，是他的直觉给他提供了三种不同的走法，然后他分析它们，然后他会花五到十分钟，但超过那个时间，他就不需要更多时间了，因为它不会增加结果。我们过度分析了很多事情。过度分析通常不会改善结果，但它会让你对结果更有信心，这也不总是一件好事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: I'm slowing down. So what he does uh well according to what he told me is that he his uh his gut feel gives him like three move three different types of moves and then he analyze them and then he spends like five 10 minutes but beyond that uh time he doesn't need time more than that because it doesn't add to to the outcome and we we over anal there are a lot of things we overanalyze by overanalyzing you it doesn't often it doesn't improve the outcome but it makes you more confident about the outcome which is also not always a good thing.

</details>

**主持人**: 您如何看待国际象棋，它是一个定义明确的棋盘、定义明确的规则、有限的、可知的一切信息都是可知且可见的，与扑克之类的游戏相比，在直觉方面有什么不同？因为如果你听 **康纳曼**（**Kahneman**），他的论点是，要真正发展直觉，你需要一个恒定的环境、快速的反馈和大量的迭代。而在投资中，你肯定没有一个恒定的环境。反馈有时可能需要很长时间，而且你可能无法在牌桌上获得大量的迭代。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How do you re like how do you think about chess which is sort of like a defined board defined rules uh finite it's knowable everything's knowable all the information is knowable it's all visible versus something like poker when it comes to intuition because you if you listen to conman I mean his argument was to really develop intuition you need a constant environment rapid feedback and a lot of iterations and in investing You definitely don't have a constant environment. Feedback can sometimes take a long time and you might not get a lot of iterations at the table.

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，我会说你在投资中一直都能得到反馈。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Well, I would argue you get feedback all the time in investing.

</details>

**主持人**: 那是怎么回事？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How is that

</details>

**发言人**: 因为股价会告诉你一些事情，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: because you well because you just the share price tells you something, right?

</details>

**主持人**: 但如果今天买入，明天的股价是反馈吗？还是噪音？您怎么看？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: But the share price tomorrow like if you buy today, the share price tomorrow is that feedback or is that sort of noise? How do you think about that?

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，这取决于。这取决于。两者都有可能。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Well, it depends. It depends. It can be can be either.

</details>

**主持人**: 那么，您如何知道自己错了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: So, how do you know when you're wrong?

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，一般来说，股价对你不利，这就是你可能错了的迹象。但当然，你不能确定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Well, generally speaking, uh, you know, with the share prices going against you, that's an indication of the fact that you may be wrong. But of course, you don't know for sure.

</details>

**主持人**: 您如何寻求分歧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How do you seek out disagreement?

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，首先你必须创造一个人们可以接受与你意见不合的环境。你需要倾听。你需要考虑他们所说的话。所以你需要创造那种氛围。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Well, first you have to create an environment where people are okay to disagree with you. You need to listen. Um, you need to take what they say into consideration. Uh, so you need to create that kind of atmosphere.

</details>

**发言人**: 我刚开始工作时，人们不反对我。他们都同意，那不太好。现在他们总是反对。这真的很好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: In the beginning in my job, people didn't disagree with me. They all agreed and that's not very good. Now they disagree all the time. You know, it's really good.

</details>

**主持人**: 您是如何改变这种状况的？因为领导者往往会被孤立。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How did you change that cuz that so often leaders leaders insulated?

</details>

**发言人**: 不，通过创造那种让人们能够畅所欲言的安全感。我的意思是，每个人都一直在告诉我他们真正的想法吗？不，当然不是，因为有些人对首席执行官怀有敬意等等。但我们正在创造一些方法。我的意思是，你是加拿大人，对吧？所以你肯定喜欢冰球。你有一些冰球，就是你用来玩的东西。我们把它们放在桌子上。就像：“嘿，这是一个直球。我不同意你说的。我认为你错了。”然后你把分歧变成一个实物，把它从人身上拿开。所以它不是针对个人的。就像：“嘿，你知道吗？我认为你说的就是垃圾。”这真的很好。所以现在我们有一个“直球奖”。那些能够恰当地表达异议的人会得到一个冰球。这很好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: No, by creating that hopefully security for people to be able to speak up. I mean, is everybody telling me all the things they mean all the time? No, of course they don't because some people have, you know, respect for the CEO and that kind of stuff. But we are creating ways of doing it. For in I mean you're Canadian, right? So you are you I'm sure you are, you know, into isoki. No, you have these pucks is, you know, things that you, you know, play with. We have them on the table. It's just like, hey, here is a straight puck. I disagree with what you say. I think you're wrong. So then you put the disagreement into like a physical object and you take it away from the person. So it's not personal. It's just like, hey, you know what? I think what you're saying here is just crap. And that's really good. So in the front now we have like a straight puck award. So the people who is kind of talking up uh you know properly disagreeing with me gets a buck. It's good.

</details>

**主持人**: 我喜欢这个想法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I like that idea.

</details>

**发言人**: 我喜欢它。我认为这真的很好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: I love it. I think it's just really good.

</details>

**主持人**: 您在内部还使用哪些有趣或反直觉但实际上非常有效的想法？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What other ideas do you use internally that would be along the same lines that may seem interesting or counterintuitive that are actually super effective?

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，你只需要努力建立一种反馈文化。我们正在努力。这不容易。给予反馈不容易，接受反馈也不容易。所以，你必须一直这样做。我在这方面做得越来越好。我更直言不讳。我现在会更多地告诉人们我不同意他们的观点，我也会努力在之后立即给予他们反馈，但这并不容易。人们非常敏感。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Well, you just have to work on getting a feedback culture. You know, we are working on it. It's not easy. It's not easy to give feedback and it's not easy to receive feedback. So, you just have to do it all the time. I'm getting better at it at this, you know. I'm I'm I'm more of a straight talker. I tell people more now that I disagree with them and uh and I tried to give them feedback straight after, but it's not easy. People are very sensitive, you know.

</details>

**主持人**: 您在如何与人意见不合方面学到了什么，这会产生影响？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Is there anything you've learned about how you disagree with people that makes a difference?

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，我的意思是，你可以稍微包装一下，但我认为你只是想直截了当。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Well, you I mean, you can pack it in a touch, but I think you just want to be pretty straight.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。很多人在您这样做的时候会很敏感。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. A lot of people are sensitive when you sort of

</details>

**发言人**: 完全是。我的意思是，这也与年龄有关。年轻人非常非常敏感。在北欧国家，我们非常非常敏感，在公共部门，他们也非常非常敏感。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: totally I mean but it's also the age right I mean young people are very very sensitive in in the Nordics we are like hyper sensitive and in the public sector they are very very sensitive you know.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。然后你得到的反馈很有趣，因为很多这样的对话实际上变成了这样：我不同意你的观点，然后对方说：“嗯，我不喜欢你反对我的方式，你让我感觉不好。”然后整个对话的主题就从实际的事情上改变了，它不再是“我不同意你这个人”，而是“我不同意你对这件事的看法”，但现在突然我们谈论的是你对我不同意的感受。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. And then the the feedback you get is it's so interesting because a lot of these conversations actually turn into that which is like I disagree with you and then it's well I didn't like the way you disagreed with me and you made me feel and then the the whole topic of the conversation has changed from the actual thing where it's not like I disagree with you as a person. I disagree with your opinion on this thing, but now all of a sudden we're talking about how you feel about my disagreement.

</details>

**发言人**: 绝对是。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Absolutely.

</details>

**主持人**: 这有点偏离轨道。这太疯狂了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And it sort of derails things. It's crazy.

</details>

**主持人**: 您在招聘时看重什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What do you look for when hiring?

</details>

**发言人**: 好奇心、智慧、正直、驱动力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Um, curiosity, intelligence, integrity, drive.

</details>

**主持人**: 您如何测试好奇心？它看起来像什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How do you test for curiosity? Like, what does that look like?

</details>

**发言人**: 你现在想学什么？你最近学到了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: What are you trying to learn now? What have you learned lately? What have you learned lately?

</details>

**主持人**: 我，我每天都在学习。我过去周二一直在深入研究您。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Me, I'm learning every day. I've done deep dive on you for the past Tuesday. That

</details>

**发言人**: 可怜的孩子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: poor thing.

</details>

**主持人**: 我学到了很多。我学到了很多关于您的事情。我学到的关于您最喜欢的事情之一是，您的办公室外面有一个冰淇淋摊位。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: I've learned lots. I've learned lots about you. One of the favorite things that came up in my learning about you is you have an ice cream stand outside of your office or something.

</details>

**发言人**: 这真的很好。这真的很好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: That's really good. That's really good.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。您为什么要用它？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah. Why do you use that?

</details>

**发言人**: 因为你希望人们过来和你交谈。所以我在冰淇淋箱旁边放了一张沙发，我经常坐在沙发上，你知道，就像在那里放松一下。然后人们过来吃冰淇淋，说：“嘿，你现在在忙什么？”他们会告诉我他们在忙什么，这真的很有趣。有时他会说：“是的，但你和这个人谈过吗？我认为他或她和你做的是同样的事情。你和那个人谈过吗？”所以我学到了很多。这很棒。我的意思是，那个冰淇淋箱的回报可能至少是 **1000** 倍。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: because you want um you want people to come by and talk to you. And so I got a sofa next to the ice cream box and I kind of hang out on the sofa quite a bit, you know, like uh just chill there and then um people come by to have an ice cream and say, "Hey, what what are you working on just now?" And they tell me what they're working on and it's really interesting. And sometimes he's like, "Yep, but have you spoken to this guy? I think he or she is doing the same thing as you. Have you spoken to that person?" So I just learn a lot. It's great. I mean the payback on that ice cream box is probably I don't know thousand times payback at least.

</details>

**主持人**: 我学到的关于您的另一件令我着迷的事情是，您在开始工作之后或开始工作之前，进行了数百次对话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: One of the other things I learned about you that I found fascinating that I wanted to follow up on actually is you had all these conversations after you started or right before you started.

</details>

**发言人**: 您与人们进行了数百次对话。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: You had hundreds of conversations with people.

</details>

**发言人**: 我进行了 **140** 次。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: I had 140.

</details>

**主持人**: **140** 次。这些对话的结构是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: 140. What were those what was the structure of those conversations like?

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，好的，这是我从一个叫 **阿尔伯特·本尼**（**Albert Benny**）的人那里学到的。他曾是瑞士一家名为 **Gabberit** 的公司和另一家名为 **Lonza** 的公司的负责人。他说：“尼古拉，当你……因为当我得到这份工作时，我想，天哪，我得到了这份工作。我的意思是，当你得到一份新工作时，你会怎么做？你会怎么做？”所以我给所有我遇到过的最好的首席执行官打电话，我说：“嘿，我该怎么办？我得到了一份新工作。我的意思是，你该如何应对一份新工作？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Um okay so this is something I learned from a guy called Albert Benny. He was the head of a company in Switzerland called Gabberit and another one called Lonza. And he said, "Nicoline, when you because when I got the job, I thought, you know, gee, I got the job. I mean, what do you do when you get a new job? What do you do?" So, I rang all the best cos I've ever met. I said, "Hey, what do I do? I I got a new job. I mean, how should I how do you approach a new job?"

</details>

**发言人**: 你要和很多人交谈，而且要在你开始工作之前进行，因为一旦你开始工作，你就没有时间了。你这样做是因为人们需要了解你，你需要了解他们，你需要更多的数据点，这样你才能做出决定。这非常重要。所以我与 **140** 个人坐下来，我只是开始问：“嘿，你有什么想法？”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: You have a lot of conversations with people and you do them before you start because after you started, you have you won't have any time. and um and you do it because people need to get to know you and you need to get to know them and you need more data points so that you can make your decisions. So that's very important. So I sit down with 140 people and I just start, hey, what's on your mind?

</details>

**主持人**: 就这样？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: That's it.

</details>

**发言人**: 是的。然后人们会有自己的想法，对吧？是的。人们在想什么？这很有趣。但当然，你会发展，就像：“好的，这里有什么好的地方？你会改变什么？你对我有什么建议？”诸如此类的事情。这很清楚。有趣的是，当你完成了其中一半的谈话时，你就能大致了解你需要做什么了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Yeah. And then people have stuff on their mind, right? Yeah. What do people think about? That's very interesting. But then of course you you develop it's just like okay what is what are the what are the good things here what would you change what's your advice to me those kind of things and it's very clear you know when you the funny thing is that when I had you know when you've had half of them you've you get the general gest of what you need to do

</details>

**主持人**: 您已经通过三角测量法找到了模式，同样的事情反复出现，这是一个强烈的信号。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: you've kind of triangulated like the same thing is coming up over and over again so that's a strong signal

</details>

**发言人**: 绝对是。我现在也做同样的事情。我在纽约待了一个月，我与公司里的每个人都坐下来，我们有 **100** 个人，我问：“嘿，你有什么想法？”然后，一个模式正在浮现。如果有一个问题，我就会尝试改变它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: absolutely I do the same now so I'm in New York for a month I sit down with everybody in the firm here we got 100 and uh hey what's on your mind and um you know there's a pattern emerging and I if there is a problem I try to I well I change it.

</details>

**主持人**: 您会问人们您正在做的事情有什么不合理之处吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Do you ask people what you're doing that doesn't make sense?

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，是的，我会问，但我可能应该问更多，因为一般来说，我们都会做一些不合理的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Uh yeah I do but I probably should do even more because people do generally speaking we all do things which are which don't make sense

</details>

**主持人**: 然后惯性就会完全占据主导，就像我们正在做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: and then inertia sort of like takes overtally like we're doing

</details>

**发言人**: 完全是。我们制作了没有人阅读的报告，就是那种事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: totally we make reports which nobody reads right that kind of thing.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**发言人**: 所以，当你和人们交谈时，第一件事就是这样。然后你就会提炼出：“好的，从这 **140** 次对话中，我得到了什么？最重要的三件事是什么？”然后你组建一个领导小组，执行这三件事，并花费所需的时间。失败的领导者会试图在太短的时间内做太多事情。我们一开始，我们两次行动过快，然后我们明白了教训，我们放慢了速度。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: So so that's the first thing you do when you when you talk to people. So then you distill down okay of everything I've taken from these 140 conversations what is it what are the three most important things and then you put together a leader group and you execute those three things and you take the time you spend the time it takes people leaders who fail they try to do too many things too quickly and we were in the beginning I we moved too quickly twice and then we we got the message and we slowed down.

</details>

**主持人**: 请再深入谈谈这一点，因为这对我来说很有趣，很多人都在努力变得越来越快。我想到我的朋友 **卡斯**（**Cass**）昨天穿了一件衬衫，他做了公开投资者电话会议，他的衬衫上写着“更快”，他完全致力于提高速度。他刚刚在 **9** 月 **14** 日或 **16** 日左右接管了公司。但您是如何做到的，是的，请再深入谈谈。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: go deeper on that for a second because that that strikes me as um something really interesting where a lot of people are trying to go faster and faster and I'm thinking you know specifically uh my friend Cass had a shirt on yesterday he did the uh open investor call um and his shirt literally said faster and he was all about increasing velocity and he had just taken over I think uh September 14th or 16th or whatever um but like how do you how how do you yeah just go deeper on

</details>

**发言人**: 首先，你需要作为一个联合领导小组来执行变革，因为如果你没有一个联合领导小组，你试图独自做一些事情，你会触发组织的免疫系统。组织会想把你赶出去，而且他们通常会成功。你会变得孤立，事情无法完成等等。所以你需要让组织感觉到：“好的，这是一个联合领导小组，抵抗这种变革没有任何意义，因为它会发生，我不如就此屈服并接受它。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: First of all, um you need to you need to execute change as a combined leader group because if you if you don't have if you don't if you aren't a combined leader group and you try to do something on your own, you'll trigger uh the immune system of the organization. You know, the organization just want to have you out and they often succeed. You know, you are isolated, you just don't get things done and so on. So you need to the organization needs to feel okay this is a this is a combined leader group there is no it doesn't make any sense to try to resist this change because it's going to come I can just as well just cave in and accept it right

</details>

**发言人**: 然后你需要优先排序，你不能做太多事情，你需要过度沟通。过度沟通变得越来越清晰。你以为你已经说过了，你以为他们听到了，但他们没有听到。让一些事情真正渗透到整个组织中是非常非常困难的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: um and then you need to you need to prioritize and you need to have not too many things and you need to overcommunicate and um the thing with overcommunication it's become just becoming clearer and clearer you know you think you've said it you think they've heard it they haven't heard it it's very very tough to get something to really permeate through an organization. So we just

</details>

**主持人**: 但你又会想：“天哪，我已经说了 **10** 遍了，我快把自己都说烦了。”但你才进行到一半。你需要继续下去。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: But then you think, gee, I've said it 10 times and I nearly I'm I'm so bored of myself, but then you're only halfway. Just need to keep going, you know?

</details>

**发言人**: 同样的信息一遍又一遍。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Same message over and over and over again.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

### CEO评估与文化建设

**主持人**: 您如何从外部仅使用公开信息来评估首席执行官的能力？当您评估一个人是否有效时，您的思考过程是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And how do you evaluate CEOs from a competence point of view from the outside just using public information? What's your thought process when you're sort of evaluating whether this person's effective or ineffective?

</details>

**发言人**: 我认为在他们上任之前很难看出来。我看到的大多数人都是有能力的，否则他们就不会得到这份工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: I think it's difficult to see before they have been in the position. Most people I see are competent otherwise they wouldn't have gotten the job you know they are

</details>

**主持人**: 他们是，我的意思是，他们了解自己的业务，他们了解公司，他们了解事情，但他们是好的沟通者吗？他们擅长执行吗？从外部很难看出来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: they are I mean they know their stuff right they know the company they know the things but are they good communicators are they good at executing it's tough to see from the outside

</details>

**主持人**: 一个人上任多久之后，您才能在财务数据，比如分析数字、量化数字中看到效果？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: how long after somebody has taken over do you start to see it in the finances like the analytic numbers the quantitative numbers

</details>

**发言人**: 我认为这取决于商业周期。这取决于公司的产品周期。但扭转一家公司需要时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: I think it depends it depends on Uh, it depends on the business cycle. It depends on kind of the product cycle of a company. But it takes time to turn around a company.

</details>

**主持人**: 完全是。我猜。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Totally. I guess the

</details>

**发言人**: 我会说，改变一种文化是一个 **10** 年的项目。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: I would say to change a culture is a 10-year project.

</details>

**主持人**: 哦，哇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Oh, wow.

</details>

**发言人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Yeah.

</details>

**主持人**: 您认为为什么需要这么长时间？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Why do you think it takes so long?

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，我的意思是，我担任这份工作已经 **5** 年了。我认为我大致完成了大约一半。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Well, I mean this I've been in the job for 5 years now. I think I'm roughly half the way in.

</details>

**主持人**: 如果您必须更快地完成，您会怎么做？这是一种强制手段吗？就像如果我们从物理学的角度来看。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: If you had to do it faster, how would you do it? Is it a matter of force? Like if we think of it from physics it's

</details>

**发言人**: 不，我认为如果你想更快地完成，你需要裁员，然后你需要换人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: no I think if you do it faster you need to lay off people then you need to change the people

</details>

**主持人**: 对。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: right

</details>

**发言人**: 在某些业务中你可以这样做，但我们不能这样做。我的意思是，在欧洲这很困难，而且我们有很棒的人。我认为我们拥有一支令人难以置信的专业人士队伍。所以，我们有一些我们希望改变的事情，对吧？我们希望系统中有更多的反馈。我们希望行动更快一点。我们希望减少一点恐惧。我们希望做这些事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: and in some in some businesses you can do that but but I but you know we can't do that in I mean in Europe it's it's difficult and also we got great people you know we were amazing people I think we got an incredible lineup of you know very very able you know professionals and so you know but there just are a few things that we'd love to you to change, right? We want to have more feedback into the system. We want to move a bit faster. We want to have a bit less fear. We want to uh do these kind of things.

</details>

**主持人**: 但那，我的意思是，它可能在您之前没有现在运作得那么好。但它有点像，当您思考时，它正在运作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: But that was I mean it was uh it probably it wasn't working as well um before you as now maybe. Um but it's sort of like that's working when you think about

</details>

**发言人**: 是的。我的意思是它运作良好。我的意思是它是一家很棒的公司。公司没有任何问题。我的意思是，真的很好。我的意思是，它只是表现出色，对吧？但我只是认为它需要一些调整。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Yeah. I mean it was working well. I mean it was is a great company. It was not nothing wrong with the company. I mean really good. I mean, just had a fantastic performance, right? But I just thought it needed some tweaks.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**发言人**: 但我的意思是，从技术上讲，它是一流的。在合规方面，也是一流的，有很多非常非常好的地方。它现在是世界的羡慕对象。嗯，它是一家好公司。我的意思是，就主权财富基金而言，您已经将您拥有的这些储备转化为永恒的财富，不仅是为了您的所有公民，也为了全球影响力，以及世界经济的过路费。我的意思是，我认为这太棒了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: But I mean, technologically, it was topnotch. Um, compliance-wise, top-notch, a lot of really, really good things. It's the envy of the world now. Well, it's a it's a good company. You've taken I mean, just in the sense of the sovereign wealth fund, too, right? you've taken these these reserves that you have and you've turned them into perpetual wealth not only for all your citizens but global influence and a tollbridge on the world economy. I mean I think that's amazing.

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，我会说这确实是政客们的功劳。当他们在 **1969** 年发现石油时，我的意思是，他们在发现石油后决定，我们应该把这笔钱投入到一个基金中。所以他们在 **1996** 年成立了它。第一次存款相对较少，现在它已经增长了很多，对吧？但政客们确实很有远见，而且从那时起，他们一直很好地遵守了原则。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Well I well I so I would say that's that's really the um that's to the credit of the politicians. You know, the politicians decided when they found oil and back in ' 69, I mean, they decided after they found oil, listen, we should put this into a fund and so in 96 they set it up. First deposit was, you know, relatively small and now it's grown a lot, right? But the politicians were really foresighted and uh and they've been good ever since to be true to the principles.

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: What are you trying to learn right now?

</details>

**发言人**: 很多东西。我只是觉得我所知甚少，我正在看我未来几个月要做的播客，我正在学习所有这些东西，我反正也需要学习它们，但这让它变得紧迫。我真的需要，你知道，下周我需要更多地了解网络。我需要阅读关于加密货币的资料。我需要阅读关于 **IMF** 的资料。哦，天哪，我需要学习的东西太多了。

</details>

**主持人**: 是不是你们不投资加密货币本身，比如 **比特币**，或者你们不投资像 **Coinbase** 这样的交易所？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Is it that you don't invest in the coins themselves or you sort of like a Bitcoin or you don't invest in the exchanges like Coinbase or something?

</details>

**发言人**: 嗯，我们有一些基础设施的所有权股份，因为它在指数中，我们以一种更被动的方式拥有它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: Well, we have we have some we have some ownership stakes in in some of the infrastructure because it's in the index and we are you know so we would own it in a in a bit more of a passive way.

</details>

### 工作与生活的融合

**主持人**: 您工作多久？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: How much do you work?

</details>

**发言人**: 我一直都在工作，但这不算工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: I work uh I work all the time, but it's not work. It's

</details>

**主持人**: 就像 **黄仁勋**（**Jensen Huang**）一样吗？您早上五点醒来，然后一直工作到晚上九点，然后对他来说，这感觉不像是工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: it's like Jensen. Is it like Jensen? You wake up at 5:00 and you're like go go go go until 9:00 and then you know for him it it doesn't feel like work. It's just

</details>

**发言人**: 我想说，我的意思是，那是他告诉我的，我有点，我的意思是，他工作比我多得多，因为他每个假期、每个周六、每个周日，一直都在工作。我通常早上五点醒来，然后阅读报纸，试图了解世界上正在发生什么，然后我开始发邮件。我的床边有一个笔记本，因为如果我半夜醒来，我通常会有一些想法，如果你不把它们写在纸上，你就会忘记它们，对吧？所以我这样做，然后我为会议工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: wait to say I mean uh that's what he that's what he told me and I kind of I I mean he works more than he works a lot more than me because he works every holiday and every Saturday and every Sunday and all the time. You know, I I tend to wake up at 5 and then I read papers and try to understand what's going on in the world and then I start to shoot mails and uh you know I have a notepad at the side of my bed because if I wake up in the middle of the night I typically have some ideas and if you don't get them done a piece of paper you're going to forget them, right? So I do that and then I work for meetings

</details>

**发言人**: 晚上我阅读，然后查看第二天的报纸。但这不算工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: um and I read in the evenings and uh you know check out the papers for the next day and but but it's not work.

</details>

**主持人**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: Yeah.

</details>

**发言人**: 我的意思是，这就像生活。很多人，**迈克尔·奥茨**（**Michael Oitz**）给了我这句话，但就像很多人都在与自己的工作作斗争。所以这更像是一种交易，而不是工作与生活的融合。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: You know it's just like it's life. So many people Michael Oitz gave me this phrase but it's like so many people fight their job. Um, and so that it's more of like a transaction than an integration between work and life.

</details>

**主持人**: 我觉得您对工作的看法更健康。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**主持人**: And strikes me that having the view that you have towards work is much healthier. And

</details>

**发言人**: 是的，但不是所有人。我的意思是，不是每个人都有机会做自己喜欢的工作，也不是每个人都那么幸运。但我真的很幸运，我最终从事了世界上我能想到的最有趣的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**发言人**: yeah, but not all people I mean, hey, it's not like everybody have the opportunity to work with what they love and you know, not everybody is that fortunate, but I've been really fortunate in that I've ended up with the things I I just cannot think of anything more interesting in in the world.
