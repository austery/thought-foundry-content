### 铝热反应：百年化学奇迹的威力

- [Derek] 这是关于一种125多年前发现的化学反应系列视频的第一集。它能释放出巨大的热量。天哪，我的GoPro。金属被液化了。它太热了。它不是炸药，但能引起爆炸。这太疯狂了！然而，反应物却如此惰性，它们可以无限期地承受喷灯的炙烤。你觉得这整个东西会炸到我脸上吗？事实上，当好莱坞导演想要制造看起来像核弹的效果时，他们选择的就是这种反应。但在其最常见的用途中，一个多世纪以来基本未变的应用，它帮助了全世界数十亿人出行。

<p class="english-text">- [Derek] This is the first in a series of videos about a chemical reaction discovered over 125 years ago. It releases a tremendous amount of heat. Oh no, the GoPro. Liquefying metal. It is so hot. It is not an explosive, but it can cause explosions. That is crazy! But the reactants are so inert, they can withstand a blow torch indefinitely. Do you think this whole thing's going to blow up in my face? In fact, when Hollywood directors wanted something that looked like a nuclear bomb, this is the reaction they chose. But in its most common use, one basically unchanged in over a century, it has helped move billions of people all over the world.</p>

### 戈德施密特兄弟与纯金属的追求

- [Derek] 在19世纪末，卡尔（Karl）和他的弟弟汉斯·戈德施密特（Hans Goldschmidt）正准备加入家族企业。他们的父亲拥有一家生产织物染料的化工厂。因此，他们师从以发明**本生灯**（Bunsen burner: 一种实验室常用的燃气灯）而闻名的罗伯特·本生（Robert Bunsen）学习化学。父亲早逝后，卡尔接管了公司管理，后来他的弟弟也加入了。汉斯的首要研究目标之一是寻找一种生产纯金属的方法。这些纯金属对于制造从服装、桌布到墙纸等各种物品的染料至关重要。

<p class="english-text">- [Derek] In the late 1800s, Karl and his younger brother, Hans Goldschmidt, were preparing to join the family business. Their father owned a chemical factory making dyes for fabrics. So they studied chemistry under Robert Bunsen of Bunsen burner fame. After their father's early death, Karl took over management of the company, later joined by his younger brother. One of Hans' first major research aims was to find a way to produce pure metals. These were essential for making dyes for everything from clothing and tablecloths to wallpaper.</p>
</details>

- [Derek] 那时，好的染料很难获得。大多数染料颜色暗淡，使用后会进一步褪色。有些染料需要收集大量奇异的昆虫。如今，我们认为颜色是理所当然的，但在那个单调的世界里，人们会为鲜艳、牢固的染料付出高昂的代价。其中一种染料是**谢勒绿**（Scheele's green: 一种化学成分为亚砷酸铜的绿色染料），顾名思义，它有毒，尽管其毒性究竟有多大仍有争议。尽管如此，由于其无与伦比的颜色，它在19世纪末成为主要的绿色染料。英国军官制服的红色是由**胭脂虫红**（Cochineal: 一种产自中美洲的昆虫）与锡混合制成的。加入锡使颜色更深、更浓烈。因此，对纯金属的需求非常强烈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">At that time, good dyes were hard to come by. Most were faint and faded further after use. Some required the collection of large quantities of exotic insects. These days, we take color for granted, but in this drab world, people would pay handsomely for bright color fast dyes. One such dye was Scheele's green, which was chemically copper arsenite. As its name suggests, it was toxic, though exactly how toxic is a matter of debate. Still, it became the dominant green dye by the end of the 19th century because its color was unbeatable. The red color of the British Army officer's coats was made from cochineal, a central American insect mixed with tin. The addition of tin made the color darker and more intense. So the demand for pure metals was strong.</p>
</details>

- 他们通过将金属溶解在溶液或酸中等各种方式来提纯金属。
- [Reporter] 注入的**氰化物溶液**（Cyanide solution: 一种含有氰化物离子的溶液，常用于从矿石中提取金银）会继续溶解汞齐化后残留在沙子中的金颗粒并将其液化。
- 然后处理盐，提纯盐，再将盐还原成金属态。而你所走的每一步都会再次带来问题，对吧？在**高炉**（Furnace: 一种用于高温熔炼金属的设备）中还原，你必须处理所有的废气以及碳带来的污染。
- [Derek] 而且金属彼此之间很难分离。
- 它们基本上会形成一种混合晶体，对吧？
- [Derek] 就像**合金**（Alloy: 两种或多种金属或金属与非金属熔合而成的具有金属特性的物质）。
- 就像合金，对。它们在某种意义上都变成了一种具有单一熔点的物质，这就是为什么你必须采取一些步骤来分离它们。

<p class="english-text">- They had their experience in purifying metals by dissolving them in solutions or in acids and all kinds of things.
- [Reporter] The incoming cyanide solution goes on dissolving the particles of gold left in the sand after amalgamation and liquefies it.
- And then work with the salts, purify the salts, and then reduce the salts into the metal state. And every step that you would take would then again cause problems, right? Reducing it in a furnace, you have to deal with all the exhaust and the contamination through the carbon.
- [Derek] And metals are very difficult to separate from each other.
- They basically, they form a mixed crystal, right?
- Like an alloy.
- Like an alloy, right. They all become, in a sense, one substance that has one melting point, which is why you have to kind of take some steps to separate them.</p>

### 汉斯的新颖构想：铝热反应

- [Derek] 于是汉斯想出了一个新颖的主意。他将用**氧化铬**（Chromium oxide: 铬的氧化物）这样的金属氧化物与铝金属反应，他希望氧气能交换伙伴，形成**氧化铝**（Aluminum oxide: 铝的氧化物）和纯铬。这种类型的反应现在被称为**铝热反应**（Aluminothermic reaction: 一种利用铝的还原性从金属氧化物中提取金属并释放大量热量的化学反应）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- [Derek] So Hans came up with a novel idea. He would react a metal oxide like chromium oxide with aluminum metal, and his hope was that the oxygen would swap partners, forming aluminum oxide and pure chromium. This type of reaction is now known as an aluminothermic or thermite reaction.</p>
</details>

- [Derek] 因此我来到德国的Electro-Thermit公司参观，这是一家戈德施密特家族的直系后代公司。我感觉他们把这里布置得像威利旺卡巧克力工厂的参观路线，只不过这是一个铝热剂工厂。在这里，我们将尝试重现汉斯首次成功的反应。本视频中的所有实验均在专业人员的监督下，采取适当的安全预防措施进行。
- 最初的实验是使用铬，但我们使用的是铜，效果是可比的。
- [Derek] 这大约是300克。
- [Axel] 是的，300克铝热剂。
- 倒进去吗？好的。我们把它倒进**坩埚**（Crucible: 一种能承受极高温度的容器，用于熔炼金属或进行高温化学反应）并点燃。好的。
- 是的。
- [Derek] 就这样？
- 是的。（大喊）
- 别动，别动，别动。
- 哇！
- （笑）那就像烟花一样。嗯，这很令人印象深刻。
- [Axel] 但你敢打赌，当他看到这个的时候，他肯定很惊讶。（两人都笑了）一把铝粉，然后你就得到了这个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- [Derek] So I have come to visit Electro-Thermit in Germany, a company that is a direct descendant of Goldschmidts. I feel like they've set this up like a tour of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory, but instead it's a thermite factory. Here we are going to try to replicate Han's first successful reaction. All experiments in this video were performed under the supervision of professionals taking proper safety precautions.
- Originally, the first experiment was using chrome, but we are using copper, which is comparable.
- [Derek] This is like 300 grams.
- [Axel] Yeah, 300 grams of thermite.
- Pour it in? All right. We pour it into the crucible and ignite. All right.
- Yeah.
- That's it.
- Yeah. (shouts)
- Leave it, leave it, leave it.
- Whoa! (laughs) That is like fireworks. Well, that's impressive.
- [Axel] But you bet he was surprised when he saw that. (both laughing) Handful of aluminum powder, and then you get this.</p>
</details>

### 铝热反应的炽热与光芒

- [Derek] 如你所见，这个反应释放出大量的能量。铝热反应的温度通常超过2000摄氏度，最高可达2500摄氏度。这是因为铝与氧形成非常强的键。当这些键形成时，它们会释放出大量的能量，远远超过打破我们最初的氧化铜键所需的能量。这种能量熔化了反应的所有产物，使它们发出炽热的光芒。很难表达它们究竟有多亮。感觉就像凝视太阳一样。如果你在视频中看到高光过曝的片段，那是因为很难判断反应会有多亮，而且它几乎总是比你预期的更亮。
- 那么，底部滴落下来的，是液态铜吗？
- [Axel] 那是液态铜，基本上就是正在形成的溶液。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- [Derek] As you can see, the reaction releases a lot of energy. The temperature of thermite reactions typically exceeds 2,000 degrees Celsius, and it can be as much as 2,500. That's because aluminum forms very strong bonds with oxygen. When those bonds form, they release a lot of energy, way more than is required to break the copper oxide bonds we started with. This energy melts all the products of the reaction and makes them glowing hot. It is hard to express just how bright they are. It feels like staring at the sun. If you see clips in this video where the highlights are overexposed, it's because it is so hard to judge how bright the reaction will be, and it's almost always brighter than you expect. So that dropping down the bottom there, is that liquid copper?
- [Axel] That's liquid copper and basically the solution that was being created.</p>
</details>

### 观察反应内部：不可能的实验

- [Derek] 但是，如果你得到这种炽热的纯金属和氧化铝混合物，你如何分离这两种材料以分离出纯金属呢？我们正尝试设置一个前所未有的实验，它将让我们能够看到坩埚内部。我们把坩埚切成两半，然后连接两块耐热玻璃，每块四毫米厚，作为观察反应的窗口。人们说这不可能，说你什么也看不到，或者玻璃会碎。
- 我们从未在镜头前这样清楚地看到过它。我认为这将非常引人入胜，可以开始分析并理解它。
- [Derek] 现在这种玻璃经过了特殊处理，所以它在接触熔融金属时不会立即碎裂。啊，那很热。那真的很热。但是二氧化硅的熔化温度约为1700摄氏度，这肯定低于反应温度，所以玻璃肯定会熔化。希望它熔化得足够慢，以容纳反应。
- 玻璃会熔化，最后，我们只剩下非常薄的一层玻璃。所以你会点燃它。由你来放置引燃器。
- [Derek] 我觉得应该让别人来点燃。我觉得应该让别人来点燃。
- [Christof] 为什么？
- [Derek] 因为我不相信自己。我们昨天看到我点燃得多么无能。就这样？（大喊）
- 别动，别动，别动。
- [Derek] 对于这个反应，我们将使用**铁铝热剂**（Iron thermite: 氧化铁和铝金属的混合物），也就是氧化铁和铝金属的组合。好的，很好。我们开始吧。天哪。哦不，我的GoPro。哦，天哪。哦不。哦不。GoPro报废了。反应从引燃器开始，向四面八方扩散。对我来说，它几乎看起来像蚂蚁或霉菌之类的东西。它看起来像有机物一样在蔓延。你看到一个脉冲。砰，砰，砰。
- [Christof] 它是有生命的。
- [Derek] 是的，看起来就是这样。为什么会有脉冲？
- 我不知道。
- [Derek] 好的。
- 我们正在努力理解。
- [Derek] 嗯。
- 我们从不知道它会那样。我们做这个已经100年了，突然你发现，你知道，每个被点燃的部分都会那样。
- [Derek] 你认为那是气体逸出，几乎是导致脉冲的原因吗？就像一些气体受热然后喷出，然后为下一个脉冲腾出空间？你似乎在这里看到了这一点。
- [Christof] 是的。
- [Derek] 哇，那很热。那真的很热。我想看得更近一些，所以我让他们把一些铝热剂放在玻璃上，然后我将使用这个探头镜头从下方拍摄。
- 我准备好了。
- [Derek] 好的，我们正在拍摄。它正在拍摄，正在拍摄，正在拍摄，正在拍摄，正在拍摄。它来了，它来了，它来了，它来了，它来了，它来了。哇！是的！曝光很好。哦，天哪。太不可思议了。这可能是有史以来最接近拍摄铝热反应的镜头了。你可以看到反应是爆发式进行的，它反应很快，但随后会暂停片刻，然后再次前进。
- 我应该拿走它吗？
- [Derek] 当然。是的，拿走它，拿走它，拿走它，拿走它，拿走它，拿走它，拿走它，拿走它，拿走它，拿走它，拿走它。哦，天哪。

<p class="english-text">- [Derek] But if you get this hot mixture of pure metal and aluminum oxide, how do you separate the two materials to isolate the pure metal? We're trying to set up an experiment that no one has ever seen before and it's actually going to allow us to see inside the crucible. We cut the crucible in half and we're attaching two pieces of thermally resistant glass, each four millimeters thick, as a window into the reaction. People said this would be impossible, that you wouldn't be able to see anything or that the glass would just break.
- We've never done this on camera and really seen it this way, this clear. And I think it's going to be fascinating to then start to analyze and make sense of this.
- [Derek] Now this glass has been specially treated, so it shouldn't shatter immediately when it comes into contact with molten metal. Ah, that is hot. That is really hot. But the melting temperature of silica is around 1,700 degrees Celsius, which is definitely lower than the temperature of the reaction, so the glass certainly will melt. The hope is it melts slowly enough to contain the reaction.
- The glass will melt and at the end, we have just a very thin layer of the glass at the end. So you will ignite it. It's up to you to place the igniter.
- [Derek] I think someone else should ignite it. I think someone else should ignite it.
- [Christof] Why?
- [Derek] Because I don't trust myself. We saw how incapable I was of igniting yesterday. That's it? (shouts)
- Leave it, leave it, leave it.
- [Derek] For this reaction, we'll be using iron thermite, so a combination of iron oxide and aluminum metal. Okay, that's good. Let's do this. Holy. Oh no, the GoPro. Oh boy. Oh no. Oh no. That's the end of the GoPro. The reaction starts at the igniter and expands outwards in all directions. To me, it almost looks like ants or mold or something. It looks organic in how it's sort of spreading. You see a pulse. Boom, boom, boom.
- [Christof] It's living.
- [Derek] Yeah, that's what it looks like. Why is there pulsing?
- I don't know.
- [Derek] Okay.
- We try to understand.
- [Derek] Huh.
- We never knew that it did that. We do this for 100 years and and suddenly you find out, you know, every portion that gets ignited does that.
- [Derek] Do you think that's gas escaping up and that's almost what causes the pulsing? Like some gas heats up and then it shoots up and then it makes space for the next one? That's what you seem to see over here.
- [Christof] Yeah.
- [Derek] Wow, that is hot. That is really hot. I wanted to get a closer look, so I asked them to put some thermite on top of glass, and then I would shoot from below using this probe lens.
- I'm ready.
- [Derek] Okay, we're rolling. It's rolling, it's rolling, it's rolling, it's rolling, it's rolling. There it goes, there it goes, there it goes, there it goes, there it goes, there it goes. Wow! Yeah! The exposure's pretty good. Oh my goodness. Incredible. This is the closest I think anyone's ever filmed a thermite reaction. You can see that the reaction proceeds in bursts, it reacts fast, but then pauses for a moment before advancing again.
- Should I take it?
- [Derek] Sure. Yeah, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, take it. Oh boy.</p>
</details>

### 脉冲现象的解释与纯金属的分离

- [Derek] 关于这可能发生的原因，我有两个想法。首先，混合物中可能含有不同大小的铝和氧化铁颗粒，它们需要以正确的比例存在才能有效反应。也许一个小区域反应完后，到达的区域比例略不理想，直到热量积累到足以触发下一个区域的反应。我的第二个想法是，颗粒之间有空气。反应加热空气，空气膨胀，增加了颗粒之间的压力，并可能将一些非反应性物质推离反应前沿。所以一旦空气逸出，下一个区域就可以点燃。一旦所有铝热剂都反应完毕，情况就会变得非常剧烈。熔融金属从坩埚顶部喷出，内部液体四处晃动。这可能是由于一些材料沸腾，实际上从液体变成了气体。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- [Derek] I have two ideas about why this might be. First, there might is a mixture of grains, big particles of aluminum and iron oxide, and they need to be present in the right ratio to react efficiently. Maybe a little pocket reacts out to where the ratio is slightly less ideal until the heat builds up enough to trigger the reaction in the next pocket. My second idea is that in between the grains, there is air. The reaction heats the air, which expands, increasing the pressure between the grains and possibly pushing some of the unreactive material away from the reaction front. So once that air escapes, the next patch can ignite. Once all the thermite has reacted, things get really violent. Molten metal is ejected out of the top of the crucible, and inside, the liquid is sloshing around. This could be due to some of the materials boiling, actually turning from liquid into a gas.</p>
</details>

- [Derek] 现在，我知道想到金属沸腾听起来很疯狂，但铝的沸点约为2500摄氏度。铁的沸点超过2800摄氏度，混合物中还有其他元素，如锰，其沸点仅为2000摄氏度。一旦沸腾停止，液体就会沉淀下来，现在就到了制造纯金属的关键步骤。液态铁的密度是液态氧化铝的两倍多。因此铁沉淀到底部，而氧化铝则浮到顶部。当金属熔穿坩埚底部时，首先流出的是铁。只有在铁排干后，氧化铝或**钢渣**（Slag: 熔炼过程中产生的浮在金属液面上的非金属废渣）才会流出。你实际上可以看到从铁到氧化铝的变化。液态铁的**粘度**（Viscosity: 流体抵抗剪切变形的能力）像水一样，所以你可以看到它从那里流出并溅开。然后钢渣就在那里开始流出。是的，它流得很顺畅。
- [Christof] 真的，真的太酷了。
- [Derek] 哇。
- [Christof] 这更像是温热的蜂蜜。
- [Derek] 是的，你完全可以看到。哇。它绝对让你身临其境。你可以看到火焰从前面冒出来。而且它还在录制。看看玻璃上的气泡。你看到那些气泡了吗？还有那铁水流出的美丽镜头。我的意思是，对于一台着火的相机来说，这是令人印象深刻的工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, I know it sounds wild to think about metals boiling, but the boiling point of aluminum is around 2,500 Celsius. Iron boils above 2,800 Celsius, and there are other elements in the mixture like manganese that boil at just 2,000 Celsius. Now, once that boiling stops, the liquid settles down, and now comes the key to making pure metal. The density of liquid iron is more than twice that of liquid aluminum oxide. So iron settles to the bottom as aluminum oxide floats to the top. Now, when the metal melts through the bottom of the crucible, the first liquid to pour out is iron. Only after it has drained does the aluminum oxide or slag follow. You can actually see the change from iron to aluminum oxide. Liquid iron has a viscosity like water, so you can see it coming out there and splashing. And then the slag starts right there. Yeah, it comes out smooth.
- [Christof] Really, really cool.
- Whoa.
- [Christof] And this is more like warm honey.
- [[Derek] Yeah, you can totally see it. Wow. It definitely gives you a sense of being right there. And you can see the flames coming off the front. And it still records. Look at the bubbles on the glass. You see those bubbles? And that beautiful shot of the iron pouring out. I mean, this is impressive work for a camera that's on fire.</p>
</details>

- [Derek] 我们将把一块**鹅卵石**（Cobblestone: 一种用于铺路的天然石块），普通的街面铺路石，放在这里面。它是由**石灰石**（Limestone: 一种常见的沉积岩，主要由碳酸钙组成）制成的。我们将把铝热剂倒在上面，然后点燃。然后我们会看到鹅卵石的密度较小。然后溶液会浮到表面。
- 是的。
- [Derek] 哇。好的。它看起来正在碎裂。那是一大块熔岩。
- [Axel] 你看到了吗？
- [Derek] 哦，是的。普通的岩石，比如鹅卵石，会浮到表面，就像钢渣一样，而密度更大的金属会沉到底部。这是在坩埚中生产高纯度金属的关键。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're going to put a cobblestone, normal street paver inside here. It's made of limestone. We'll pour the thermite on top and then ignite it. And then we'll see that the cobblestone is less dense. Then that solution, it's going to come up to the surface.
- Yeah.
- Whoa. Okay. It looks like it's breaking into pieces. That's a good bit of lava.
- [Axel] Did you see it?
- Oh yes. Ordinary rocks like cobblestones rise to the surface, just like the slag, as the denser metal drops to the bottom. And this is key to producing high purity metal in the crucible.</p>
</details>

### 铝热反应的早期应用：远程焊接与结构拆除

- [Derek] 因此，汉斯·戈德施密特（Hans Goldschmidt）开发了一种生产纯铬、铜和铁等金属的方法。这对于化学染料的制造可能非常有用，但汉斯怀疑它可能有更广泛的应用。他在1895年获得了这项工艺的专利，并撰写了出版物。他写道：“我在这里提出的程序，其原理是如此简单，以至于我几乎没有时间来介绍，如果不是因为其令人惊讶和非凡的效果。”铝热剂是一种寻找问题的解决方案。铝热剂的首批应用之一是在偏远地区焊接金属部件。
- 无论你需要非常坚固、非常可靠的焊接，并且是在一个偏远地区，你没有奢侈地携带大量设备和焊接工具，铝热剂都非常有用。你知道，最早的一些客户实际上是航运公司。当船轴在大洋中间断裂时，在当时，你就会迷失方向。而现在有了铝热剂，至少能够以某种方式修复它，让你回家，这实际上非常有用。它能够修复发动机缸体中的东西或裂缝，并且具有超强的移动性，因为你知道，就像我们说的，只需要两个人和一个水桶。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So Hans Goldschmidt had developed a process to make pure metals like chromium, copper, and iron. This could be great for chemistry in making dyes, but Hans suspected it could have even broader applications. He patented the process in 1895 and wrote it up for publication. He wrote, "The procedure that I have here is in its principle so extraordinarily simple that I could hardly have undertaken the time to present, if not for its surprising and extraordinary effects." Thermite was a solution looking for problems. One of the first applications of thermite was to weld metal parts in remote locations.
- Wherever you need a very, very strong, very reliable weld and kind of a remote area where you don't have the luxury of bringing, you know, tons of equipment and tons of welding gear, that is useful for thermite. You know, some of the first customers were in fact shipping companies. When some shaft would break in the middle of the ocean, at the time, you would be lost. And now having like thermite to be able to at least fix that in some way that would get you home was actually very useful. It was being able to fix something or to fix cracks in engine blocks and to be super mobile with it, because you know, like we said, it takes two guys and the bucket.</p>
</details>

- [Derek] 当然，在这种情况下，铁铝热剂实际上不会产生纯铁，而是**钢**（Steel: 铁与少量碳及其他元素形成的合金）。这是通过在铝热剂粉末中加入碳和其他合金元素来实现的。
- 没有人需要纯铁。纯铁实际上是无用的。它非常柔软，即使在干燥的空气中也会立即腐蚀，没有人会想要它，对吧？
- [Derek] 你需要含有一些碳的铁。
- 完全正确。你需要含有一些碳的铁，这样才能制成钢。
- [Derek] 所以今天生产的大部分铝热剂都是钢铝热剂。
- 你可以拥有一个可以随心所欲移动的炼钢厂。冷战结束后，我们基本上用铝热剂来销毁，比如说坦克的炮管。基本上你把一部分铝热剂塞进炮管，然后点燃它，它就会把炮管焊死并摧毁，之后就完全没用了。那些都是不再有用的武器或物品，我们用铝热剂来销毁它们，因为它非常快速且非常安全。
- [Derek] 而且它非常彻底。
- 而且它非常彻底。一旦你把它放进去，就绝对没有办法再次使用那件武器了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- [Derek] Of course, in this case, the iron thermite would actually not produce pure iron, but rather steel. This was done by including carbon and other alloying elements in the thermite powder.
- Nobody needs pure iron. Pure iron is actually useless. It's very soft, it corrodes immediately even in dry air, and nobody will want that, right?
- [Derek] You need iron with some carbon in it.
- Exactly right. You need iron with some carbon, that makes it a steel.
- [Derek] So the majority of thermite produced today is steel thermite.
- You have this steel mill that you can, you know, move wherever you want it to have. After the end of the Cold War, we would use thermite basically to destroy, say gun barrels from tanks. Basically you have a portion of thermite that you basically stick into the gun barrel and then you would ignite it and then it would basically weld the gun barrel and destroy it and it would be completely useless afterwards. Those are all kinds of weapons or stuff that were not useful anymore that we use thermite to destroy because it's very quick and it's very safe.
- [Derek] And it's very final.
- And it's very final. Once you've put that in, there is absolutely no way of making use of that weapon again.</p>
</details>

### 铝热反应的现代应用：信息销毁

- [Derek] 铝热剂的一个现代应用是利用其产生的热量来销毁信息。超过某个温度，即**居里温度**（Curie temperature: 磁性材料失去磁性的临界温度），磁体就会失去磁性。因此，存储在磁性硬盘上的信息在足够高的温度下会变得无法恢复。这看起来是一种非常不同的铝热剂形式。
- 是的。
- [Derek] 我习惯看到它是粉末状的。
- 以前也是粉末，我们把它烘干。
- [Derek] 我能把它拿起来吗？
- 是的。
- [Derek] 我的意思是，它就像一块普通的瓷砖。
- 是的，把它放下来。
- [Derek] 哇。（笑）太棒了。这很酷。所以如果我们想确保没有人能读取这个硬盘上的信息，我可以把这个放在上面吗？
- 是的。
- [Derek] 瞧。当我们点燃坩埚时，我们会在短时间内获得高温。而在这里，我们可以持续10分钟，所以一切都会被摧毁。
- 所以你在这里控制能量释放，使其变慢。
- 是的。温度不高，反应也较慢。
- [Derek] 我将点燃这块铝热剂砖的四个角，它将持续发热约10分钟，我们将看看它对这台笔记本电脑会造成什么影响。好的，我们点燃它。哦，我喜欢这个。看它怎么渗出来？哇。这是一种完全不同的效果。哇。是的，它正在变热。它正在接触笔记本电脑。这真的很酷。你得看到熔融的黏稠物从笔记本电脑下面流出来。那太疯狂了。看了这么多铝热剂，这是它的一个完全不同的版本。看看那里的金属池。哦。是的，没有人能从那台笔记本电脑上获取任何数据了。那太棒了。我没想到会在铝热剂中看到标志。我能把它拿起来吗？
- [Christof] 当然。（两人都笑了）

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- [Derek] A modern application of thermite is to use the heat generated to destroy information. Past a certain temperature, the Curie temperature, magnets lose their magnetism. So information stored on magnetic hard drives at high enough temperatures becomes unrecoverable. This looks like a very different form of thermite.
- Yes.
- [Derek] I'm used to seeing it as a powder.
- Before it was also powder and we dry it.
- [Derek] Can I pick it up or?
- Yes.
- [Derek] I mean, it's like a normal piece of tile.
- Yeah, lay it down.
- Whoa. (laughs) That's amazing. That is cool. So if we want to make sure no one can read the information on this hard drive, I could put this on top?
- Yeah.
- There you go. When we ignite the crucible, we have this high temperature for a short moment. And here we have it for 10 minutes, so everything is destroyed.
- So you're controlling the energy release to make it slower here.
- Yes. The temperature's not so high, and reaction is slower.
- [Derek] I am going to light this thermite tile in all four corners, and it's going to generate heat for about 10 minutes, and we'll see what it does to this laptop. All right, let's light it. Ooh, I like this. See how it's oozing? Whoa. It's a totally different effect. Whoa. Yeah, that's getting hot. It's getting to the laptop now. This is really cool. Like you got to see the molten goo coming out from underneath that laptop. That is wild. After seeing so much thermite, this is a totally different version of it. Look at the puddle of metal there. Oh. Yeah, nobody's getting any data off that laptop. That is awesome. I did not expect to see the logo in thermite. Can I lift it?
- [Christof] Of course. (both laughing)</p>

<p class="english-text">- [Derek] I've never destroyed data like this before, but every time I get a spam call, I wish I could just magically make the records of my phone number disappear. Fortunately, today's sponsor Incogni can help. Now, I used to get several spam calls a day, which frustrated me so much that I contemplated making a video where I would just mess with these spam callers to get a small amount of revenge. But ever since I started using Incogni back in April, I no longer have to because they solve this problem for me. You see, there are a lot of data brokers out there that collect all sorts of different information about you, like your name, phone number, email address, and even your social security number. And then they sell this information on the open market, which is why you can get calls from people who you've never even given your number to. But Incogni battles these data brokers. You simply give Incogni permission and they figure out who has your data. And then they know which laws apply, and so they can send the right letter with the correct legal terms to each data broker with the request to remove your information. What I love about Incogni is that it's super easy to use and it actually works, and it saved me a ton of time. So far, they filled out 192 requests on my behalf, 145 of which have been completed, saving me over 108 hours of work.

### 铝热反应：可控的力量而非爆炸物

- [Derek] 现在你可能会认为，鉴于铝热剂释放的能量之大，它可以用作炸药，但实际上它并不适合这个目的。
- 铝热剂之所以如此有趣和重要，是因为你可以很好地控制它。如果你发生爆炸，你可以很好地计算能量，并说它会产生X兆焦耳的能量，但很难说是在多长时间内产生。
- [Derek] 也许它不是爆炸物的原因之一是，当发生爆炸性反应时，通常你的反应物是固体，而产物是气体，这显然会大量膨胀并产生很大的压力。但在这个例子中，反应物和产物都是固体吗？
- 它们是固体和液体。
- [Derek] 是的，没错。你对正在发生的一切有如此多的控制。
- 哇。我感觉像是被晒伤了。这种特性使得在炸药会造成太大破坏的情况下拆除建筑物成为可能。

<p class="english-text">Now you might think, given the amount of energy given off that thermite could be used as an explosive, but it's actually not well suited for that purpose.
- What makes thermite so interesting and so important is that you can control it so well. If you have an explosion, you can kind of calculate the energy really well and say it's, you know, X amount of megajoules that you get out, but it's really hard to say over what time.
- [Derek] Maybe one of the reasons why this is not explosive is because when you have explosive reactions, typically your reactants are solid and the products are gases, which obviously expand a lot and create a lot of pressure. But in this case, both the reactants and products are solids?
- They're solids and liquids.
- [Derek] Yeah, right. You have so much control over what's going on.
- Woo. I feel like I got a sunburn from that. This property makes it possible to take down structures where explosives would cause too much damage.</p>

### 受控拆除：德国国会大厦的案例

- [Derek] 1933年，阿道夫·希特勒（Adolf Hitler）成为德国总理四周后，柏林的德国国会大厦（Reichstag building）被纵火焚烧，直到24年后才完全修复。但烧毁的钢穹顶失去了结构完整性，需要拆除。传统的炸药会对旧建筑的其余部分造成无法弥补的损害。因此，在1957年11月22日，铝热剂炸药被绑在穹顶上，点燃后，它们熔穿了钢材，钢材整齐地落入下面的前全体会议厅，从而使修复工作得以完成。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In 1933, 4 weeks after Adolf Hitler became the chancellor of Germany, the Reichstag building in Berlin was set on fire and it would only be fully repaired 24 years later. But the burnt out steel dome had lost its structural integrity and needed to be removed. Now, conventional explosives would've caused irreparable damage to the rest of the old building. So on November 22nd, 1957, thermite charges were strapped to the dome and when ignited, they melted through the steel, which fell neatly into the former plenary hall below, allowing the repairs to be completed.</p>
</details>

- [Derek] 这样的应用之所以可能，是因为铝热反应可以被精确控制。他们对成分的调配非常精细，你甚至可以在室内点燃铝热剂，而不用担心熔融金属四处飞溅。这种混合物包含了一些纯**钢**（Steel: 铁与少量碳及其他元素形成的合金）碎片。它们不参与反应，但它们在熔化时会吸收热量。因此，它们有助于控制反应速率和达到的温度。
- [Axel] 好了。
- [Derek] 好的。
- [Axel] 就这样？
- [Derek] 就这样？
- 是的。
- [Derek] 我不认为它进去了。哦，天哪。哇。哇。
- 有趣的是，通过墨镜看，它看起来像玉米面包松饼之类的东西。一个真正重要的控制参数是，反应开始后多久金属开始从坩埚底部流出。这被称为**出钢时间**（Tap time: 熔炼过程中金属从炉中流出的时间）。这很关键，因为如果出钢时间太短，内部的金属就不会与钢渣完全分离。但如果出钢时间太长，金属就会从坩埚壁溶解更多的二氧化硅，而且流出时也会比本应更冷。
- 那么钢的化学成分会随着时间而变化。
- [Derek] 停留的时间越长。
- 完全正确。停留的时间越长，这就是为什么我们能够控制它实际停留的时间非常重要。
- [Derek] 你希望出钢时间恰到好处，处于中间。我们在这里设置了这个实验来测试。我们能否控制钢流出的时间？所以想法是它应该先从这个流出，然后是这个，然后是那个。我们将同时点燃所有三个，看看会发生什么。
- 你准备好了吗？3，2，1。是的。它们几乎同时点燃，但第一个坩埚的出钢时间，我们得到了一个，是迄今为止最短的。两个。如果这个停下来，第三个开始，那将是非常非常令人印象深刻的。来吧，第三个。哇。太棒了。太棒了。

<p class="english-text">Applications like this are possible because the thermite reaction can be carefully controlled. They have the ingredients so dialed in that you can actually ignite thermite indoors without fear of molten metal flying all over the place. This mixture includes some pieces of pure steel. They don't participate in the reaction, but they do absorb heat as they melt. So they help control the rate of reaction and the temperature reached.
- [Axel] There you go.
- All right.
- That's it.
- Yes.
- [Derek] I don't think it was in. Oh boy. Whoa. Wow.
- It's interesting, like looking at it through dark glasses, it looks like a cornbread muffin or something. One of the really important parameters to control is how long after the reaction starts does the metal start flowing out the bottom of the crucible. This is known as the tap time. It's critical because if the tap time is too short, the metal inside doesn't fully separate from the slag. But if the tap time is too long, then the metal dissolves more silica from the walls of the crucible and it also comes out colder than it could have been.
- So the chemistry of the steel actually changes over the time.
- [Derek] The longer it stays in there.
- Exactly. The log it stays in there, and this is why it's very important for us to be able to control how long it actually stays there.
- [Derek] You want the tap time to be somewhere in the middle, just right. We've set up this experiment here to test. Can we control the time when the steel comes out? So the idea is it should come out of this one first, then this one, then that one. We're going to ignite all three simultaneously and see what happens.
- You good? 3, 2, 1. Yes. They all ignited at almost exactly the same time, but the top time of the first crucible, we got one, was by far the shortest. Two. It'd be amazing if this one stops and the third one goes, like that would be very, very impressive. Come on, third one. Wow. That's great. That's fantastic.</p>
</details>

### 控制温度与原材料

- [Derek] 另一个可以控制的属性是金属的温度。
- 这里我们有两种不同的版本。所以我们有一个12%**阻尼**（Damping: 在此上下文中指通过添加惰性物质来减缓或控制反应速率）的版本，这里有一个25%阻尼的版本。
- [Derek] 有时你希望金属流出时更热或更冷一点。好了。点火控制得很好。嗯，那个反应更剧烈。哇。你可以看到12%的那个先动了。哇！你可以看到，你知道，这个先开始，所以你可以有点感觉，但我觉得它们都达到了2000度。我不知道。
- 右边那个是阻尼较小的部分之一，另一个是阻尼较大的部分之一。我们可以大幅度地改变两个方向的温度，稍微高一点和显著低一点。
- [Derek] 所有这些控制都是通过仔细调整铝热剂混合物来实现的。
- 这是制造铝热剂的起点。大约每天一到两次，一辆卡车会运来这些东西。这是**磨屑**（Mill scale: 钢材热轧过程中表面形成的氧化层）。所以这基本上是不同氧化铁的混合物。当你热轧钢材时，钢材表面非常活跃，因为它非常热，并且涉及大量水来冷却轧辊，所以表面会迅速氧化并形成这种磨屑。然后他们使用水射流将其从钢表面吹掉。对于轧钢厂来说，这只是废品，对吧？
- [Derek] 哇。
- [Axel] 好了。
- [Derek] 这很酷。
- 外面的磨屑运到这里，然后被烘干，因为铝热剂和水，它们不是完全兼容的，你希望磨屑尽可能干燥，然后保持干燥，所以这就是我们烘干它的方式。
- [Derek] 氧化铁被摇晃着沿着螺旋坡道送到顶层，在那里，颗粒被分离成不同的大小和成分，然后与铝粉混合。我想这也必须非常干燥。
- 这里没有那么多问题，因为它的制造方式不含任何水。对于氧化铁，它是通过水射流吹掉的。我们必须控制所有元素，即反应元素，也就是氧化铁和铝，以确保每个部分都有其非常明确的反应性。然后我们就能得到我们想要的反应，以及钢中我们想要的化学性质。
- [Derek] 你们用“份”这个词。
- 份，是的。这是我们用的词。一份基本上就是一袋铝热剂。
- [Derek] 不准拍照。
- [Cameraman] 这家伙总是打破规则。
- [Derek] 所以这些份被单独装袋，并储存在仓库里。
- 这是我们的仓库，但这只是其中一个。而且这还不是最大的。
- [Derek] 我能问你一个问题吗？好的，昨天我们看到铝热剂中含有巨大的能量，而这个仓库里有大量的铝热剂。所以我的问题是，这在任何方面都是危险的吗？
- 这是一个公平的问题。这是一个公平的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">- [Derek] Another attribute that can be controlled is the temperature of the metal.
- Here we have two different versions. So we have a version with 12% damping, and here we have with 25.
- [Derek] Sometimes you want the metal to come out a little hotter or a little colder. There we go. Nicely controlled ignition. Well, that one goes a lot more. Wow. You could see the 12% one went first. Whoa! You can see that, you know, this one starts first, so you can get a bit of a sense, but I feel like both of them reached 2,000. I don't know.
- The one on the right side is one of the less dampened portions, and the other one is one of the more dampened ones. We could dramatically change the temperatures in both directions, a little bit higher and significantly lower.
- [Derek] All of this control is achieved by carefully adjusting the thermite mixture.
- This is the starting point of the making of thermite. About once or twice a day a truck comes and drops in this. This is mill scale. So this is basically a mixture of different iron oxides. When you hot roll steel, the surface of the steel is very reactive because it's so hot and there is so much water involved to cool the rollers, so that the surface actually oxidizes very quickly and creates this mill scale. And then they use like water jets to blow it off the steel surface. And for the rolling mill, this is just a waste product, right?
- [Derek] Whoa.
- [Axel] There you go.
- [Derek] That is cool.
- The mill scale from outside comes in here and then gets dried because thermite and water, they're not exactly friends and you want the mill scale to be as dry as possible and then stay dry, so this is how we dry it.
- [Derek] The iron oxide is shaken up the spiral ramp to the top floor, and there, the particles are separated into different sizes and compositions before being mixed with aluminum powder. This also has to be very dry, I imagine.
- It's not as much a problem here because the way that it's being manufactured doesn't contain any water. With the iron oxide, it's getting blown off with the water jets. We have to control all the elements, the reactive elements, which is the iron oxide and the aluminum to make sure that every portion has their very defined reactivity. And then we get the reaction that we want and also the chemical qualities in the steel that we want.
- [Derek] You guys use this word portion.
- Portion, yeah. That's the word that we use. A portion is basically one bag of thermite.
- [Derek] No cameras.
- [Cameraman] Always breaking the rules, this guy.
- [Derek] So the portions are bagged up individually and stored in the warehouse.
- This is our warehouse, but this is only one of them. And this is not even the biggest.
- [Derek] Can I ask you one question here? Okay, yesterday we saw there's a tremendous amount of energy in thermite and in this warehouse, there's a tremendous amount of thermite. So the question for you is, is this in any way dangerous?
- It's a fair question. It's a fair question.</p>

### 铝热剂的安全性：高激活能

- [Derek] 他们为我安排了这次演示，让我看看铝热剂有多安全。他们想让我尝试用越来越大的**引燃剂**（Igniter: 用于启动化学反应的装置或物质）点燃这整坩埚的铝热剂。但我并不完全相信这是个好主意。也许你能帮我点燃它。
- 克里斯托夫（Christof）在哪里？你试过这个吗？
- [Christof] 没有。
- [Derek] 嗯，在这种情况下，我会给你一些安全装备。
- [Christof] 我有95%的把握你点不着它。
- [Derek] 95%？
- 好了。那是安全装备。
- [Derek] 那是二十分之一的几率。我们是这样做的吗？这是一件防火服。
- 至少会有记录怎么发生的。（笑）
- [Derek] 所以首先，这里有一个小打火机。好的，我们试试看。看看我能不能点燃它。三，二，一。我正在让这里的一些铝热剂颗粒变得非常热，以至于它们实际上发出了橙色的光。哦，哦，哦。它变得相当亮了。你看着它担心吗？
- 不，不担心。
- [Derek] 我听到你发出声音了，我就想，“不，他担心了。我不应该让它停留在同一个地方。”你觉得这整个东西会炸到我脸上吗？
- [Axel] 不，我希望不会。
- [Derek] 所以你可以看到，即使让它——
- [Axel] 炽热发光。
- [Derek] 炽热发光，它仍然不会点燃。好的，我们拿出更大的喷灯。我将用这个试试。那里有一团漂亮的蓝色火焰。我感觉这个不如另一个打火机热，所以我看到了一点橙色，但只是勉强。我们得拿出大家伙了。好的，我们点燃它，三，二，一。你觉得我们能积累足够的热量吗？多热？
- [Axel] 500。
- [Derek] 你是说500？
- [Axel] 是的。
- [Derek] 我可以看到很多铝热剂发出橙色的光。有一些碎片冒出来。
- 漂亮地发光。
- [Christof] 700。
- [Derek] 700度。我认为这是一个很好的演示，表明铝热剂在正常条件下不会点燃。哇。
- [Axel] 好了。它还在发光。
- [Derek] 它熔化了吗？
- [Axel] 是的，那可能会发生。
- [Derek] 它会熔化但不会——
- 不会点燃。
- [Derek] 不会点燃。搞什么鬼。那简直是疯了。
- 显然，这里有很多潜在能量，但要获得这些能量真的非常非常困难。所以如果它着火了，你知道，无论如何，木托盘会燃烧，你都无法点燃铝热剂。
- [Derek] 甚至不会。
- 不，它只会呆在那里，它只会无视你。
- [Derek] 这种缺乏反应性的关键在于铝粉。
- 铝相当稳定，因为它被氧化铝覆盖着，只有当它被剧烈加热，使得大量颗粒上的氧化层破裂时，反应才能开始。
- [Derek] 所以氧化铝是铝热剂的秘密阻滞剂吗？
- [Axel] 完全正确。
- [Derek] 密封。这种反应具有非常高的**激活能**（Activation energy: 化学反应发生所需的最低能量），所以它不能被打火机或丙烷喷灯点燃。好的。这就是为什么我们一直使用**氢氧化钡**（Barium hydroxide: 一种无机化合物，常用于烟花和引燃剂）引燃剂。基本上，就是烟花里的那种东西。
- [Christof] 新年快乐。
- [Derek] 它会变得足够热，足以穿透氧化铝层并启动反应。
- 我们要确保点火温度足够高，以便只能故意点燃它。因为一旦它开始——
- [Derek] 我将在三、二的时候按下按钮。
- 就没有办法阻止它了。（铝热剂爆炸）
- [Derek] 那太疯狂了。我在德国拍摄了整整五天，所以这只是即将到来的内容的一小部分。我们将了解铝热剂如何与环境反应，我们还将有一个专门的视频，介绍铝热剂最常见的应用——焊接铁轨。可能会有数百万人观看这个视频。他们中的大多数人可能都坐过火车。他们乘坐的火车经过你们的铝热剂焊缝的可能性有多大？他们会经过的。
- [Derek] 100%？
- 100%。
- [Derek] 所以请务必订阅，以便在这些视频发布时收到通知。

<p class="english-text">- They set up this demonstration for me to see how safe thermite is to handle. They want me to try to ignite this full crucible of thermite with increasing sized ignition sources. But I wasn't entirely confident this was a good idea. Maybe you can help me ignite it.
- Where's Christof? Have you tried this by the way?
- [Christof] No.
- Well then, under these circumstances, I would get you some safety gear.
- [Christof] I'm 95% sure that you cannot ignite it.
- 95?
- There you go. That's safety gear.
- That's a one in 20. Is that how we're doing it? This is a fireproof suit.
- At least there will be footage how it happened. (laughs)
- So first, here's a little lighter. All right, let's give it a shot. See if I can get this to ignite. Three, two, one. I'm making some of the thermite particles here quite hot so that they are actually glowing orange. Oh, oh, oh. It's getting quite bright. Are you getting worried watching that?
- No, not getting worried.
- [Derek] I heard you make a noise and I was like, "No, he's getting worried. I shouldn't keep it on the same spot." Do you think this whole thing's going to blow up on my face?
- [Axel] No, I hope not.
- So you can see like even getting it-
- [Axel] Glowing hot.
- Glowing hot, it still won't ignite. All right, let's pull out a bigger torch. I'm going to try with this one. Got a nice big blue flame there. I feel like this is not as hot as the other lighter, so I'm getting a little bit of orange there, but just barely. We're going to have to bring out the big guns. All right, let's torch it in three, two, one. Do you think we can build up enough heat? How hot?
- [Axel] 500.
- [Derek] Did you say 500?
- [Axel] Yeah.
- [Derek] I can see a lot of thermite glowing orange. There's some pieces coming out.
- Nice and glowing.
- [Christof] 700.
- [Derek] 700 degrees. I think this is an excellent demonstration that thermite is not going to ignite under normal conditions. Wow.
- [Axel] There you go. It's still glowing.
- [Derek] Did it melt?
- [Axel] Yeah, that can happen.
- It can melt and not-
- Not ignite.
- Not ignite. What the. That is absolutely nuts.
- Obviously, there is a lot of potential energy here, but getting that energy is really, really difficult. So if it would catch a fire and, you know, whatever, the wooden pallets would burn, you would not be able to ignite the thermite.
- [Derek] Would not even.
- No, it would just sit there and it would just ignore you.
- [Derek] The key to this lack of reactivity is the aluminum powder.
- The aluminum is quite stable because it's covered in aluminum oxide, and only if it gets so violently heated that that layer breaks down in a large number of particles, then the reaction can start.
- [Derek] So the aluminum oxide is like the secret stopper of thermite?
- [Axel] Exactly.
- [Derek] The seal. This reaction has a very high activation energy, so it can't be started by a lighter or a propane torch. Okay. This is why we've been using barium hydroxide igniters. Basically, the same stuff that's in sparklers.
- [Christof] Happy New Year.
- It gets hot enough to break through the aluminum oxide layer and start the reaction.
- We want to make sure that the ignition temperature is so high that it can only light it deliberately. Because once it's going.
- [Derek] I am going to push the button in three, two.
- There is no way of stopping it. (thermite explodes)
- [Derek] That is crazy. I was filming in Germany for a full five days, so this is just a taste of what's to come. We'll find out how thermite reacts with its environment and we'll have a dedicated video on the most common application of thermite, welding railroad tracks together. There probably will be millions of people watching this video. Most of them have probably ridden on a train. What is the likelihood that they have ridden over one of your thermite welds? They will.
- [Derek] 100%?
- 100%.
- [Derek] So make sure you're subscribed to be notified about these videos when they come out.</p>
