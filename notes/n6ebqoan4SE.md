summary: 关于人类进步的讨论日益激烈，我们是否走在正确的轨道上？本文作者杰森·克劳福德回顾了进步理念的历史演变，指出在人类历史的大部分时间里，进步并非主流观念。直到15、16世纪，随着地理大发现和弗朗西斯·培根等思想家的推动，进步的理念才逐渐确立。工业革命后，进步加速，形成正反馈循环。然而，20世纪的两次世界大战和经济大萧条，打破了人们对进步的盲目乐观。作者认为，近50年来，除了信息技术，其他领域（如制造、交通、能源）的进步明显放缓，这表明进步并非必然，而是取决于我们的信念和投入。未来仍有无限可能，但需要我们主动去创造。

title: 人类进步的停滞与未来展望：一项历史与哲学的反思
---

### 引言：对进步理念的质疑

围绕进步和人类的讨论确实变得非常激烈：我们是否走在正确的轨道上？我们在做什么？我们甚至知道自己在做什么吗？也许现代性是一个错误，也许进步本身就是问题所在，也许我们应该放慢它、停止它，甚至倒退。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The discourse around progress and humanity has really heated up. Are we on the right track? What are we doing? Do we even know what we're doing? Maybe modernity was a mistake. Maybe progress itself is the problem. And maybe we should slow it down or stop it or or even go backwards.</p>
</details>

在20世纪，人们对进步这个概念本身变得怀疑、恐惧和不确定，我们允许这种情绪减缓了进步本身，这是一个错误。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">People got skeptical, fearful, doubtful of the very idea of progress in the 20th century. And we allowed that to slow down progress itself. And that was a mistake.</p>
</details>

我是**杰森·克劳福德**（Jason Crawford: 根源进步研究所的创始人兼总裁），我正在撰写一本名为《**技术主义者宣言**》（The Technoist Manifesto: 一本探讨技术进步的书籍）的书。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">My name is Jason Crawford. I'm the founder and president of the Roots of Progress Institute and I'm writing a book called The Technoist Manifesto.</p>
</details>

我将从头开始，尝试简洁地讲述这个故事。关于进步理念，有一件重要的事情需要了解，那就是它在人类历史的大部分时间里并不存在。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I'm going to rewind to the beginning and I'm going to try to tell the story concisely. Okay. One important thing to know about the idea of progress is that it really didn't exist through most of human history.</p>
</details>

可以说，在大多数地方和时代的大多数民族，并没有将历史视为某种上升的曲线。他们将历史视为更具周期性的，也许充满了起伏，或者他们甚至相信一种衰落主义叙事，即过去是一个黄金时代，我们从中跌落，并可能继续跌落。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I say most peoples in most places and times didn't see history as some kind of an upward curve. They saw history as more cyclical maybe uh full of ups and downs or perhaps they even believed in a declinist narrative a story of the past being a golden age from which we have fallen and perhaps will continue to fall.</p>
</details>

### 进步理念的历史演变

这种情况在西方直到15世纪和16世纪才真正改变。当时，实际上有一场关于现代人是否能够超越古代人巨大成就的大辩论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This really only changed in the west around the 15 and 1600s. At the time there was a big debate actually about whether the modern people of that era could ever surpass the huge achievements of the ancients.</p>
</details>

他们回顾古希腊和古罗马，回顾那些人发现的思想，例如罗马人用混凝土建造的竞技场和渡槽，甚至埃及的金字塔。当时有些人认为，那些古人一定是道德和智力上的巨人。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">They were looking back to the ancient world, the Greeks and the Romans at the ideas that those people discovered, what the Romans could do with concrete, for instance, the coliseum and the aqueducts and even the pyramids of Egypt. Some people at the time had this idea. Those ancients must have been a race of moral and intellectual giants.</p>
</details>

他们认为，我们所能做的也许只是阅读和重读古代文献，并从中尽可能多地汲取意义和知识，但我们永远无法超越他们，学习新事物，发明新事物，并向前发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That all we can do maybe is read the ancient texts and reread them and and try to ring as much meaning and learning as we can out of them but that we could never surpass them, learn new things, invent new things and go forward.</p>
</details>

随着始于探索和发现世界的航海大发现，以及新大陆的发现，西方的情况开始发生变化。我们的知识正在扩展，人们开始思考，哇，也许我们真的可以学习新事物，也许我们可以创造新发明。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Things started to change in the west with the voyages of discovery that started to explore and discover the world and discover entire new continents. Our knowledge was expanding. People started to think that wow maybe we could actually learn new things. Maybe we could create new inventions.</p>
</details>

### 弗朗西斯·培根与实证方法的崛起

如果你看看**弗朗西斯·培根**（Francis Bacon: 英国哲学家、科学家、政治家，被誉为“科学方法之父”）的著作，他是一位生活在16世纪末到17世纪的英国人。培根是那些主张“还有更多东西有待发现”的人之一。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you look at the writings of Francis Bacon, this is an Englishman who lived at the end of the 1500s into the 1600s. And Bacon was one of the people who was arguing no, there's a lot more to be discovered.</p>
</details>

他指出古代人不知道的所有事物。例如，他们不知道美洲大陆，他们不知道火药或指南针。他们也不知道印刷术，即15世纪发明的**古腾堡活字印刷机**（Gutenberg movable type printing press: 欧洲最早的活字印刷技术）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And he pointed out all of the things that the ancients didn't know about. They didn't know about the Americas, for instance. They didn't know about gunpowder or the magnetic compass. They didn't know about the printing press, the Gutenberg movable type printing press, which was invented in the 1400s.</p>
</details>

培根说：“印刷术中没有什么是不显而易见的。如果还有更多这样的东西有待发现呢？”他用所有这些作为证据来证明他的观点，即进步是可能的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Bacon said, "There's nothing in the art of printing that is not plain and obvious. What if there are a whole lot more things like this out there to be discovered?" And he used all of this as evidence to make his case that essentially progress was possible.</p>
</details>

他主张在科学中使用一种**经验方法**（empirical method: 基于观察和实验而非理论推断的科学方法），这在当时并非标准。他认为，如果我们这样做，并且如果我们做得更好，投入更多精力系统地收集并尝试解释我们的观察结果，我们将能够发现新事物，创造新发明，最终所有这些将汇聚在一起，“赋予人类生活新的能力和力量”，我相信这是他使用的短语。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">That if we used the right method, and he was really advocating for an empirical method in science, which was not the standard at the time, if we do this, and if we get better at doing it and put more effort into systematically collecting and and and trying to explain our observations, we'll be able to discover new things, we'll be able to create new inventions, and that ultimately all of this can come together to endow human life with new abilities and powers, I believe, is the phrase that he used.</p>
</details>

他的预测基本上用了200年才实现，直到**工业革命**（Industrial Revolution: 18世纪末至19世纪初的重大技术、社会和经济变革）才完全实现。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">His prediction essentially took 200 years to come true. It wouldn't come into full fruition until the industrial revolution.</p>
</details>

### 工业革命与进步的加速

因此，在17世纪和18世纪，随着科学的进步，进步的理念缓慢建立起来。我们开始有了**牛顿**（Isaac Newton: 英国物理学家、数学家，提出万有引力定律）的**万有引力**（universal gravitation: 描述物体之间引力作用的物理定律）理论。化学领域也开始发展，人们真正识别出元素，并开始整理出元素周期表。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there was a slowly building idea of progress through the 1600s, 1700s as we got advancements in science. We started to get Newton's theory of universal gravitation. We started to get developments in chemistry, people really identifying elements and you know starting to work out the periodic table.</p>
</details>

然后，随着工业革命的到来，到19世纪，各种令人惊叹的新事物被发明出来：铁路、电报、电话、电灯泡。到19世纪末，培根的观点显然是完全正确的。进步成为现实，进入了千家万户，改变了每个人的生活。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then with the industrial revolution, certainly by the 19th century, all sorts of new amazing things were getting invented. The railroad, the telegraph, the telephone, the light bulb. By the end of the 19th century, it's very clear that Bacon was absolutely right. It was a reality coming into people's homes and transforming everybody's lives.</p>
</details>

### 进步的反馈循环机制

这是一个进步如何自我构建的绝佳例子。进步孕育进步。人类历史上的长期进步模式是进步加速。它不仅仅是每年恒定的百分比增长。从长远来看，这种百分比增长率实际上是在增加的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, this is a great example of how progress builds on itself. Progress begets progress. The long-term pattern of progress over human history is that progress accelerates. It's not just a constant percentage, you know, growth each year. Over the long term, that percentage growth rate actually increases.</p>
</details>

为什么会发生这种情况？根本原因是反馈循环。进步孕育进步。当我们取得进步时，有时发明、新技术或基础设施是如此基础，以至于它反过来又促进了进步本身的过程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Why does this happen? The fundamental reason is feedback loops. Progress begets progress. When we make progress, sometimes the invention or the new technology or infrastructure is so fundamental that it feeds back into the process of making progress itself.</p>
</details>

想想早期的工业革命。你有煤炭、蒸汽动力、铁和火车头。所有这些东西都相互强化，对吧？火车头是用铁制造的，由煤驱动的蒸汽机提供动力。火车头也被用来运输煤炭、铁矿石和制成品。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Think about the early industrial revolution. You've got coal, you have steam power, you have iron, and you have locomotives. Now, all of these things reinforce each other, right? The locomotives were made out of iron. They were powered by steam engines that were driven by coal. The locomotives were also used to transport coal and to transport iron ore and to transport finished products.</p>
</details>

蒸汽动力用于制造过程中，用铁等材料生产产品。所以，所有这些东西都在相互强化。即使在今天，你也可以在各种事物中看到这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Steam power was used in the manufacturing processes that created the products out of iron and so forth. So, all of these things were reinforcing each other. And you can see this even today with all sorts of things.</p>
</details>

例如，我们发明了计算机和软件，现在它们被用来驱动经济中的其他一切。计算机甚至被用来设计更好的计算机，对吧？所以技术会自我反馈。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Computers for instance, we invent uh computers and software and now they are used to power everything else in the economy. Computers are even used to design better computers, right? So technologies feed back on into themselves.</p>
</details>

世界人口也是如此，我们越擅长支持人类生活，人口就增长得越多。人口越多，就有越多的头脑来解决各种问题。更多的科学家、更多的研究人员、更多的发明家、更多的企业创始人，所有这些人都致力于解决人类生活中的各种问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">World population, the better we get at supporting human life, the more population grows. The more people we have, the more brains we have working on all kinds of problems. The more scientists, the more researchers, the more inventors, the more business founders, all of these people working on uh you know all of the different problems of human life.</p>
</details>

甚至我认为，最根本的是进步理念本身。在实际取得进步、相信我们能够取得进步、然后基于这种信念投资于进步，并取得更多进步之间，存在一个良性循环。这就是进步加速的步伐。即使按百分比计算，今天的事物也发展得更快。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Even I think you know most fundamentally the very idea of progress itself. There's a a virtuous cycle between actually making progress, believing that we can make progress and then investing in progress motivated on that belief and then making even more of it. And so that is the accelerating pace of progress. Things move faster today even on a percentage basis.</p>
</details>

### 20世纪的幻灭与进步的停滞

因此，到19世纪末，20世纪初，我们进入了一个非常乐观的时期。人们真的将工业进步、技术、发明和科学视为一台几乎不可阻挡的机器，它只是在为每个人创造更好的生活。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So by the end of the 19th century, the beginning very beginning of the 20th century, you got this, you know, very optimistic period. They really saw industrial progress and and technology and invention and science as just this almost unstoppable machine that was just, you know, making things better for everyone.</p>
</details>

当然，也有反对意见，请不要误解我。在整个过程中，一直有人不认为这是一件好事，从1750年代的**卢梭**（Rousseau: 法国哲学家，启蒙思想家）开始，他就谈到他认为道德和社会进步与艺术和科学进步几乎成反比，而他甚至还没有看到工业革命。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There were definitely objections, you know, don't get me wrong. there were uh people all through this entire process who who didn't see it as such a great thing all the way from Rouso in the 1750s who was you know talking about how you know he thought that the progress of morals and society was almost inversely proportional to the progress of arts and sciences and he hadn't even seen the industrial revolution yet.</p>
</details>

所以，当时有很多针对所有这些科学、技术和工业的浪漫主义反弹，但大多数人认为这是一件好事，而且我认为那些反对的声音在很长一段时间内都属于少数。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So there was a lot of you know kind of romantic backlash against all of this science and technology and industry but for the most part people saw this as a good thing and I think those uh you know those kind of voices of backlash who were really in the minority for for a very long time.</p>
</details>

但发生的情况是，人们对进步的走向和发展方式有点天真。首先，他们认为进步是自动且不可避免的，是必然会发生且无法阻止的事情。他们认为道德进步和社会进步也会自动、必然地展开，并与科学技术进步齐头并进。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But what happened was people were a little naive about how progress was going and how it was going to go. One, they saw it as kind of automatic and inevitable as this this thing that was just going to definitely unfold and nothing could stop it. They thought that moral progress and social progress would also automatically inevitably unfold and go handinhand with progress in science and technology.</p>
</details>

到19世纪末，人们非常乐观地认为，工业的新增长、贸易和通讯的扩张，所有这些都将带来世界和平的新时代，结束战争。当然，他们大错特错了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By the end of the 19th century, people were very optimistic that this new growth of industry and expansion of trade and communication that all of it was leading to a new era of world peace, an end to war. And of course, they were terribly wrong.</p>
</details>

20世纪的两次世界大战暴力地粉碎了那些天真的幻想。很明显，技术并没有导致战争的结束，反而使战争变得更加可怕和具有破坏性。它带给我们机关枪、化学武器和原子弹。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The world wars of the 20th century violently shattered those naive illusions. It was clear that technology had not led to an end to war. It had made war all the more terrible and destructive. It had given us machine guns, the chemical weapon, the atomic bomb.</p>
</details>

我们还经历了全球性的经济大萧条、全球极权主义的兴起、环境问题，对污染和人类健康的危害的担忧。我们遇到了技术风险以及新技术是否会带来新的安全隐患的担忧。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We also got a worldwide depression, the rise of totalitarianism around the globe, environmental concerns, right? Concerns about pollution and harms to human health. We ran into concerns about the risks of technology and whether new technology could create uh new safety hazards.</p>
</details>

出现了非常强烈的反文化声音，这种对进步理念本身的浪漫主义反弹认为：“看，也许现代性是一个错误。也许进步本身就是问题，也许我们应该放慢它、停止它，甚至倒退。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You had these very strong countercultural voices, this kind of romantic backlash against the very idea of progress that said, "Look, maybe modernity was a mistake. Maybe progress itself is the problem, and maybe we should slow it down or stop it or or even go backwards."</p>
</details>

我认为那里有一些非常现实的问题。进步的成本和风险是真实存在的。进步是混乱的。如果我们否认这一点，或者声称进步总是无处不在的好，或者我们不需要做任何事情来引导它或减轻问题，我们将一无所获，也不会给人类带来任何好处。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think there were some very real questions there. The costs and risks of progress are real. Progress is messy. we're not going to get anywhere and we're not going to do humanity any favors by denying that or by claiming that progress is sort of always and everywhere good or that we don't need to do anything to steer it or to mitigate the problems.</p>
</details>

我们绝对需要这样做。只有当我们承认进步的成本和风险，然后着手实际解决它们并向前迈进时，我们才能创造人类生活、繁荣和福祉。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We absolutely do. We're only going to create human life and flourishing and and well-being if we acknowledge the costs and risks of progress and then step up to to actually solve them uh and to move forward.</p>
</details>

我确实认为，在过去大约50年里，我们看到了科学、技术和经济进步的暂时性放缓。当我第一次听到人们谈论这个问题时，我并不相信，但随着我对进步历史的深入研究，我越来越意识到这可能是真的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I do think that we've seen what I hope is a temporary slowdown in scientific, technological, and economic progress over the last roughly 50 years. I didn't believe this at first when I started hearing people talking about it, but the more I looked into the history of progress, the more I realized that I think it's true.</p>
</details>

当然，我们在信息技术、计算机和软件方面取得了很大的进步，这些领域确实没有放缓。但在制造业、建筑业、交通运输业、能源等所有这些领域，我们基本上仍然使用1960年代和1970年代的相同基本技术。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We've seen a lot of progress, of course, in information technology, in computers and software, there's really been no slowdown there. But in manufacturing, construction, transportation, energy, all these areas, we're still using basically the same fundamental technologies that we used in the 1960s and 70s.</p>
</details>

我们仍然使用基于化石燃料的电力作为主要能源。我们仍然使用**内燃机**（internal combustion engine: 一种将燃料燃烧产生的热能转化为机械能的发动机）。我们乘坐的飞机基本上与1960年代的飞机相同。我们使用相同的基本大规模制造，你知道，工厂流程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We're still using fossil fuel-based electricity as our main power source. We're still using the internal combustion engine. We're flying on basically the same kind of planes that we flew on in the 1960s. We're using the same basic sort of mass manufacturing, you know, factory processes.</p>
</details>

所以，所有这些东西当然都看到了改进，看到了很多渐进式的改进，成本改进，安全改进，但它没有看到我们早期时期那种大规模的范式转变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, you know, all of this stuff has seen it's seen improvement certainly it's seen a lot of incremental improvement, cost improvements, safety improvements, but it hasn't seen the kind of massive paradigm shifts that we saw in an earlier period.</p>
</details>

考虑一下大约1870年到1920年这个时期。这是一个50年的时期，结束于100年前。在那段时间里，据我统计，经济的不同方面大约发生了五次重大革命。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Consider the period from about 1870 to 1920. So, there's a 50-year period that ended 100 years ago. In that time, we saw roughly by my count five major revolutions in different uh aspects of the economy.</p>
</details>

第一，我们发明了电力工业，包括发电机、电动机和电灯泡。第二，我们发明了内燃机以及它所带来的可能性，即汽车和飞机。第三，信息技术发生了革命，包括电话和无线电。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">One, we got the invention of the electrical industry, the generator, the electric motor, the electric light bulb. Two, we got the invention of the internal combustion engine and uh the things that it made possible, the automobile and the airplane. Three, there was a revolution in information technology with telephone and radio.</p>
</details>

第四，**合成化学**（synthetic chemistry: 通过化学反应合成新物质的化学分支）发生了革命，我们得到了第一批合成塑料和合成肥料。然后是公共卫生革命。我们有了**细菌理论**（germ theory: 认为疾病是由微生物引起的理论）及其在改善水卫生、新疫苗等方面的首次应用，所有这些都开始真正降低死亡率。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Four, there was a revolution in synthetic chemistry and we got things like the first synthetic plastics and synthetic fertilizer. And then there was a revolution in public health. We got the germ theory and some of its first applications with better water sanitation, new vaccines and all these things started to uh really decrease mortality rates for the first time.</p>
</details>

所以，全面发生了五次革命。如果我看看100年后的同一时期，即1970年到2020年，我只统计到一到两次革命。信息技术、计算机和互联网领域无疑发生了一场革命，也许在**基因工程**（genetic engineering: 通过改变生物体基因组来改变其特性的技术）和生物学领域也可以算一次。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So five revolutions across the board. If I look at the same period 100 years later, so 1970 to 2020, I count one and maybe two revolutions. There was definitely a revolution in information technology and computers and the internet and maybe you could count one in in genetic engineering and biology.</p>
</details>

但同样，能源、制造业、交通运输等领域并没有出现同样根本性的突破。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But again, those areas like energy, manufacturing, transportation, those just have not seen the same fundamental breakthroughs.</p>
</details>

### 进步并非必然：我们的选择至关重要

我认为过去50年进步相对放缓的教训是，进步并非自动或不可避免的。它不会自行发展。它取决于我们。它取决于我们的选择。它取决于我们是否相信进步，并愿意继续投资于它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think the lesson of the relative slowdown in progress of the last 50 years is that progress is not automatic or inevitable. It doesn't just uh barrel along. It depends on us. It depends on our choices. It depends on us believing in progress and wanting to continue to invest in it.</p>
</details>

每一代人都必须接过进步的火炬并将其传承下去。如果没人相信未来，那么没人会去建造它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Each new generation has to sort of pick up that torch of progress and and carry it forward. If nobody believes in the future, then uh nobody's going to build it.</p>
</details>

### 展望未来：无限的潜力

我认为关于未来最重要的事情是，未来相对于现在可以像现在相对于过去一样美好。在1800年，世界上绝大多数人生活在极端贫困中。今天，只有一小部分人如此。我们已经取得了巨大的进步。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The most important thing I believe about the future is that the future can be as well off relative to the present as the present is compared to the past. In 1800, the vast majority of the world lived in extreme poverty. Today, uh only a small fraction does. We've come such a very long way.</p>
</details>

我们已经将世界出生时的预期寿命增加了一倍多。与几百年前的人们相比，我们现在的生活要好得多。然而，如果你问当时的一般人，他们并不认为自己生活在极端贫困中。他们认为那是正常的，因为确实如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">We've more than doubled, you know, world uh life expectancy at birth. we are so much better compared to people a couple hundred years ago. And yet, you know, if you ask the average person back then, they didn't think that they were living in extreme poverty. They thought it was normal because it was normal.</p>
</details>

当没有人拥有冰箱时，没有冰箱似乎很正常。当没有人用电时，没有电似乎很正常。当没有人拥有厕所或室内管道时，没有这些似乎很正常。我们今天不认为自己生活在极端贫困中。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Not having a refrigerator seems normal in when nobody has one. Not having electricity seems normal when nobody has one. Not having a toilet or indoor plumbing seems normal when nobody has it. We don't think that we're living in extreme poverty today.</p>
</details>

但我认为，如果我们在200年后创造出如此美好的未来，未来的人们会回顾我们，说：“我简直不敢相信他们是那样生活的。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I think that 200 years from now, the future could be so amazing if we created that those future people will look back on us and saying, "I cannot believe they lived that way."</p>
</details>

未来我们能够发明或正在发明的东西太多了：**人工智能**（Artificial intelligence: 模拟人类智能的机器智能）、基因工程、**核聚变能**（fusion energy: 利用核聚变反应释放能量的清洁能源技术）、重返太空并创造真正的太空经济，定居月球、行星，有一天甚至定居恒星。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">There are so many things that we, you know, could invent in the future or are inventing right now. Artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, fusion energy, going back to space and creating a real space economy and settling, you know, the moon and the planets and and one day the stars.</p>
</details>

所有这些东西一旦我们拥有，我们就会认为它们是绝对必要的，即使今天它们看起来像科幻小说。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All of these things once we have them we will consider them absolutely essential even if today they seem like science fiction</p>
</details>
