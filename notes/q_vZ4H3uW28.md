### 设定新年目标的减法哲学

**Chris Williamson**: 别把生活看得太严肃。没人能活着离开这场游戏。再过三代人，甚至没人会记得你的名字。如果这都不能让你感到解脱，让你暂时放下烦恼去寻找快乐，那我不知道还有什么能做到了。因为生活中永远不会有没有问题的时刻。这就是为什么圣诞节和新年之间的这段时间，是一个规划年度大梦想和目标的绝佳时机。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Williamson**: Stop taking life so seriously. No one is getting out of this game alive. And in three generations, no one will even remember your name. And if that doesn't give you liberation to just drop your problems for a moment and find some joy, I don't know what will because there'll never be a time when there's no problems in life. And that's why this time in between Christmas and New Year is a really wonderful time to plan big dreams and goals for the year.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 那么，我们来聊聊这个。Chris Williamson 是世界领先的播客主持人和思想家之一。现在他回来了，教我们如何建立自律，将目标转化为结果，是什么阻止了我们寻找爱情，以及在当今社会什么才算是一个好男人？

要弄清楚明年你应该做什么，最好的一个问题是：为了让我回顾 2026 年并认为它是成功的，到 2026 年底必须发生什么？这通常归结为几件事。第一点是，为了拿起某些东西，你必须放下某些东西。把标准定得不切实际地高并不能提高你的表现。比如你可能想减掉 20 磅并找个男朋友。你不可能在做这些的同时，还搬到新城市并创办一家新公司。所以，要做一个假设：我能做的并不比我现在做的多。

第二点，如果你的生活是一部电影，观众正在观看，他们会对着屏幕尖叫让你去做什么？这通常很明显。离开那段关系。这份工作不适合你。凶手藏在橱柜里。因为如果你不小心设计你所追求的东西，你可能会花一辈子的时间才意识到，你爬上了一个巨大的梯子，但它却搭在了错误的墙上。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So, let's talk about that. Chris Williamson is one of the world's leading podcast hosts and thinkers. And now he's back educating us on how to build discipline, turning goals into results, what's stopping us finding love, and what makes a good man in today's society?

The single best question to work out what you should be doing next year, what would have to happen by the end of 2026. For me to look back and consider it a success and it usually comes down to only a few things. The first one is in order to pick something up, you have to put something down. So setting the bar unrealistically high does not increase your performance. Like you probably lose 20 lb and get a boyfriend. You can't do that and move cities and start a new business. So, make the assumption, I can do no more than I'm doing now.

Second thing, if your life was a movie and the audience were watching, what would they be screaming at the screen telling you to do with your life? It is obvious. Leave the relationship. The job is not working for you. The killer's hiding in the cupboard. Because if you're not careful with how you design what it is that you chase after, you can spend your entire life realizing that you climbed a huge ladder that was leaning up against the wrong wall.

</details>

**Chris Williamson**: 还有其他的吗？试图征服、试图达到精通、试图真正驱动自己去做事，这确实有美妙的一面。但我也不赞同那种“去他的感受，只管拼命干直到眼睛流血”的态度，因为我今年学到的最大教训之一就是：压抑并不等同于力量。对于那些能感知情绪的男人来说，表现出他们能感知情绪是一件好事，对吧？就像我在过去 12 个月里经历了一些最低谷。感觉好像更好的自己在从指缝中溜走。我意识到我的情绪是合理的，否认自己这一点对任何事情都没有帮助。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Williamson**: And is there anything else? So there is a wonderful upside in trying to conquer and trying to achieve mastery, trying to really drive yourself to go and do stuff. But I'm not like your feelings, just hustle and grind until your eyes bleed either because one of the biggest lessons I've taken away from this year is suppression isn't the same thing as strength. And it's a good thing for guys who feel their emotions to show that they feel their emotions, right? Like I've been at some of my lowest points over the last 12 months. It felt like my better self was slipping through my fingers. I realized my emotions are legitimate and denying myself that is not helping anything at all.

### 为什么新年决议总是失败

**Steven Bartlett**: 我的听众非常关心如何让生活变得更好。我认为在这个时候，改变是每个人心中的首要任务。每个人都在考虑新年决议，想在 2026 年成为什么样的人。但当你查看统计数据时，23% 的人在一月的第一周结束时就放弃了他们的新年决议。大约一半的人会在一月底前放弃他们寻求的改变。只有大约 9% 的人会坚持他们的新年决议一整年。所以我想我的开场问题是，这一年中的这个时候真的重要吗？在你看来，这是一个思考改变的有用且高效的时间吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: My audience care a lot about changing their life for the better. And I think at this time of year, change is front of mind for everybody. Everybody's thinking about New Year's resolutions, who I want to become in 2026. But when you look at the stats, 23% of people quit by the end of the first week of January, their New Year's resolution, the thing they aimed at. Roughly half of people will quit their New Year's resolution, the change they sought by the end of January. and only about 9% of people will keep their New Year's resolution for the full year. So I guess my opening question to you is does this time of year matter at all? Is it a useful productive time to be thinking about change in your point of view?

</details>

**Chris Williamson**: 我认为世界分为两个阵营。一个阵营说 1 月 1 日和 12 月 31 日没有区别。为什么要等？现在是 12 月 10 日，现在就做。另一个阵营喜欢这种有一个“文化上适宜的时刻”来停止做某事并开始做其他事情的想法。

大多数人需要意识到，他们已经花了大量时间在担忧过去和未来。他们回到过去后悔的事情上：“我希望我当时的做法不同。”或者对已经发生的事情进行反刍。然后他们担心未来：“我对将要发生的这件事感到不确定。”所以，你已经在担心过去，你已经在做反思和计划，只是以一种非常无组织的方式进行，你无法选择它何时击中你的脸。

这是一个文化上适宜的时刻，就像一个日程安排上适宜的时刻，让你介入并思考。在圣诞节和新年之间，生活往往会慢下来一点。这是一个很好的检查时刻。1 月 1 日并没有什么特殊的魔法，但这是一个很好的结构化机会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Williamson**: I think the world is split into two camps. Uh one camp says there is no difference between January 1st and December 31st. Like why wait? It's December 10th, just do it now. and the other camp likes the idea of there being a culturally appropriate moment to stop doing something and start doing something else.

Most people need to realize that they're already spending tons of time worrying about the future in the past. They're going back to this thing that they regret. I wish I'd done this differently. Oh, I I have uh uh rumination about something that occurred. Then they're concerned about the future. They're thinking, "I'm uncertain about this thing that's going to happen." So, you're already worrying about the past. You're already doing reflection and planning just in a very unstructured way where you don't get to choose when it hits you in the face.

This is a culturally appropriate moment, like a scheduling appropriate moment for you to just step in and think. In between Christmas and New Year, life tends to slow down a little bit. It is a good moment to check in. There is no special magic super secret squirrel source in January 1st. But it is a good moment to check in because life tends to slow down a little bit.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 我想每个人都应该问自己的问题是，我应该瞄准什么？是否存在瞄准太多东西的情况？什么是改变的好目标？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: I guess the the question that everybody should be asking themselves is what should I aim at? And and is there such a thing as aiming at too many things? What what what is a good goal for change?

</details>

**Chris Williamson**: 这非常令人不知所措。如果你意识到，“哇，我可以做任何我想做的事”，这绝对是可怕的。我想说的一点是，这是你在行为上改变任何事情的机会。你可以改变任何你想改变的，但不能改变所有你想改变的。这就是问题所在。你可以在行为上成为任何你想成为的人，但你不能成为所有你想成为的人。

所以，你需要选择少数几个。计算明年你应该做什么的最好问题是：为了让我回顾 2026 年并认为它是成功的，到 2026 年底必须发生什么？这通常归结为几件事。将标准定得不切实际地高并不能提高你的表现。想象一下你去自助餐，把盘子装得尽可能满。你说：“我想要所有这些东西，我的胃会扩张以容纳它们。”我们的胃不是那样工作的，我们的工作量也不是那样工作的。

所以，第一条规则：**为了拿起某些东西，你必须放下某些东西**。

不要假设仅仅因为你在工作量的盘子里装了更多东西，你的工作能力就会扩张以适应它。假设我能做的并不比我现在做的多。我可以转换任务，但我不能增加更多。为了拿起某些东西，我必须放下某些东西。这真的很重要，因为如果你用动力和热情来推动自己完成目标，你的目标在很大程度上是建立在你无法控制的燃料源上的。你对长期的动力没有太大的控制权。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Williamson**: Yeah. It's very overwhelming. Uh if you realize, wow, I can do anything I want. That's absolutely terrifying. One thing I would say, this is your opportunity to change anything behaviorally. You can change anything you want. Not everything you want. Right? That's the problem. You can become anything you want behaviorally, but you can't be everything you want.

So, you need to pick a small number. The single best question to work out what you should be doing next year. what would have to happen by the end of 2026 for me to look back on 2026 and consider it a success. it usually comes down to only a few things. Setting the bar unrealistically high does not increase your performance. Imagine that you went into a buffet and you made your plate as big as possible. He said, "I want all of these things... and my stomach is going to expand to be able to fit it." That's not the way that our stomachs work and that is not the way that our workloads work.

So, first rule, in order to pick something up, you have to put something down.

Don't assume that just because you've loaded more onto your workload plate, your work capacity will expand to be able to fit it into your stomach. Make the assumption I can do no more than I'm doing now. I can switch stuff, but I can't add more in. And in order to pick something up, I have to put something down. That's a really important thing because if you're using motivation and enthusiasm to work yourself through your goals, your goals are predicated largely on a fuel source that you don't have control over.

### 人生电影与 85 岁的自己

**Steven Bartlett**: 我认为这是一个非常重要的点，因为当我们思考我们在每年这个时候设定的目标时，所有目标都在要求更多的时间或更多的精力。比如我想开始跑步，我想开始去健身房。正如你所说，这意味着我必须从盘子里拿掉一些东西。我们通常不会在这个时候考虑减法。我们不会想“我要少花时间和朋友在一起”或者“我要戒掉 Netflix”。我们想的是加法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: I think that's a really important point because when we think about the goals we'll start setting at this time of the year, all of them are asking for more time or more energy. Like pretty much all of them ask for I want to start running. I want to start going to the gym. Whereas, as you say, that means I'm going to have to take something off the plate. And we don't think about subtraction at this time of the year. Typically, we don't think I'm going to spend less time with my friends. I'm going to cut out Netflix. We think of addition.

</details>

**Chris Williamson**: 让我们来问几个让人不舒服的问题。

如果我想让 85 岁的自己尽可能痛苦，我会怎么度过我的一天？

我在过去一年里做了什么，让我现在感到这种束缚感？

我不喜欢我和手机的关系。我不喜欢我的早晨效率不高。我注意到当我与朋友在一起时，我并不专注。我注意到当事情变得困难时，我倾向于孤立自己。我注意到我养成了当别人问我问题时不讲真话的习惯。我注意到我养成了不为自己的需求辩护的习惯。

如果你的生活是一部电影，观众看到现在，他们会对着屏幕尖叫让你去做什么？这通常很明显。离开那段关系。这份工作不适合你。凶手藏在橱柜里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Williamson**: Let's go through a bunch of uncomfortable questions people can ask themselves.

How would I spend my day if I wanted to make 85year-old me as miserable as possible?

What is it that I did over the last year that made me right now feel it's this constriction.

I don't like my relationship with my phone. I don't like how uh my mornings aren't very productive. Uh I've noticed that when I'm with my friends, I'm not very present. I've noticed that I spend a lot of time on my own. I tend to isolate when things get difficult. I've noticed that I've got into the habit of not telling the truth when people ask me a question. I've noticed that I've got into the habit of not advocating for my needs when I should do.

If your life was a movie and the audience were watching up to this point, what would they be screaming at the screen telling you to do with your life? They would be it is obvious. Leave the relationship. The job is not working for you. The killer's hiding in the cupboard.

</details>

**Steven Bartlett**: 那么，如果这是一部电影，观众对着你尖叫，他们会尖叫什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: So, if this was a movie and the audience was screaming at you. What would they be screaming?

</details>

**Chris Williamson**: 你做得已经够多了。停止鞭策自己屈服，以为你的幸福就在你要实现的下一组目标的另一边。你已经实现了你说过会让你快乐的目标。如果你现在还没做到，如果这不是生活开始的时候，那什么时候开始？

有一个很棒的概念叫**延期生活假设 (Deferred Life Hypothesis)**。这基本上是一种普遍的信念，即我们的生活还没有开始。现在发生的事情只是某种前奏。而在反思时，很多人意识到，他们跑过的这个前奏是一个海市蜃楼，随着他们的接近而消退，他们实际上只是在跑向生命的终点。

人们把幸福当作人质。他们处于一种等待模式，就像一架因为某种原因无法降落的飞机。如果这永远不会改变呢？如果你生活中的问题永远不会消失呢？问题是一个特性，而不是一个错误。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Williamson**: You're already doing enough. Stop whipping yourself into submission, thinking that your happiness sits on the other side of the next set of goals that you're going to achieve. You've already achieved goals that you said would make you happy. So if you haven't made it now, if this isn't when life is going to begin, then when when when are you going to start?

There's this uh wonderful idea of the the deferred life hypothesis. Deferred life hypothesis is basically the sort of common belief that our life hasn't yet begun. That what's happening now is a sort of prelude. And upon reflection, what a lot of people realize is that this prelude that they run through was a mirage that sort of faded as they approached and they were actually just running toward the end of their life.

People are holding their happiness hostage. They're in a holding pattern like a plane that can't land for some reason. It's like what if that what if that never changes? What if your problems in life are never ever going to go away? Problems are a feature, not a bug.

### 墨西哥渔夫与不可教授的教训

**Steven Bartlett**: 我喜欢你谈论的关于成功指标的内容，你谈到了**可观察指标 (Observable Metrics)** 和 **隐藏指标 (Hidden Metrics)**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: The other thing that I I love that you talk about is what it when we talk about metrics of success, you talk about observable metrics and hidden metrics of success.

</details>

**Chris Williamson**: 是的。很多时候我们会用隐藏指标交换可观察指标。可观察的东西是你的职位头衔、年薪、有多少人认识你、银行余额、房子的大小、开的车。

既然你的成功只能从外部来判断，我们自然会用别人看不到的东西去交换别人能看到的东西。例如，很多人会用更长的通勤时间来换取更高的薪水。通勤时间的长短是与幸福感最相关的统计数据之一。更长的通勤时间可靠地让人更痛苦。你因此失去了什么隐藏指标？那是与家人相处的时间减少了，与妻子联系的时间减少了，追求自己激情的时间减少了。

如果你已经过着舒适的生活质量，却为了得到更多而交易它，交易你的幸福或平静，那你就是在做一个糟糕的选择。这让我想起了**墨西哥渔夫寓言**。

一个美国商人在墨西哥度假，一个渔夫带他出海。商人问：“你每天都做什么？”渔夫说：“我每天早上出海钓一点鱼，带回家，和妻子家人一起吃我当天钓到的鱼。”美国人说：“这太蠢了。你应该买艘更大的船，钓更多的鱼，去市场卖。”渔夫问：“我为什么要那样做？”“那你就可以买更多的船，雇朋友为你工作，批发销售。”“我为什么要那样做？”“那你就可以建一个罐头厂，出口到英国，拥有巨大的生意。”“我为什么要那样做？”“那你就可以退休，早上钓一点鱼，然后下午和家人在一起。”

这和保罗·柯艾略的《牧羊少年奇幻之旅》是同一个教训：这个小男孩经历了一段巨大的旅程，发现他寻找的东西一直就在后花园里。但这是一个**不可教授的教训 (Unteachable Lesson)**。经历一段巨大的旅程最后回到起点，并不等同于从未离开。你必须到达山顶，然后说：“该死。我以为那会是答案。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Williamson**: Yeah. So, a lot of the time we'll trade a hidden metric for an observable metric. Something that's observable would be your job title, what your salary is per year, how many people know you, your bank balance, the size of your house, the car that you drive.

Since the only way that your success can be judged is outwardly. So naturally we trade something which people can't see for something that they can see. For instance, lots of people would trade a longer commute for a higher salary. The length of your commute is one of the most correlated uh stats with your happiness. Longer commutes reliably make people more miserable. And what's the hidden metric that you've lost by doing that? Well, that's less time with your family, with your wife to connect, that's less time to pursue your own passions.

But after a while, you have to admit if you already live a comfortable quality of life and you trade it, you you trade your happiness or your your peace in order to get more, you're making a bad choice. Which I think links to the story of the Mexican fisher.

An American businessman was away on a holiday in Mexico and he got taken out by a fisherman and he asked the fisherman, "So, what do you do each day?" The fisherman said, "I spend each morning out on the water. I fish a little. I catch some food. I take it home and I sit in my house with my wife and my family and we eat what I've caught for the day." The American says, "That's stupid... what you should do is you should get a bigger boat and then you could catch more fish and then you could go sell it at the market... then you could create a canning factory and you could export it back to the UK and you could have a huge business." Fisherman said, "Why would I do that?" "So well then you would be able to retire and fish a little on a morning, catch some fish, and then spend the afternoon with your family."

And it's the same lesson as Paulo Qua's The Alchemist, which is this young boy goes on a huge big journey and he finds out the thing that he was looking for was in the back garden all along. But that's an unteachable lesson. And the big lesson behind The Alchemist is going on a massive journey to end up back where you started is not the same as having never left. You have to go to the top of the mountain to get up there and go, "Damn it. I thought that was going to be the answer."

### 高回报的新年决议：戒酒与睡眠

**Steven Bartlett**: 你提到 10 年前设定的目标至今仍是你最重要的目标。那些你最珍视的目标是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: You mentioned there that goals you set 10 years ago are still some of your most important today. What are those goals that you cherish the most?

</details>

**Chris Williamson**: 我会给你我的。**卧室里不放手机**。把它充在外面。这是立竿见影的 15% 生活质量提升。

因为当你开始新的一天时，如果你用手机当闹钟，你翻身关掉闹钟，立刻就在看手机。你还没起床，还没活动，还没补水，还没看到阳光，你就被世界打脸，告诉你发生了什么，而不是拥有一个小小的平静微观世界。

这也意味着当你晚上睡觉时，你会切入你的睡眠时间。如果你睡不着，你可以翻身拿起手机，现在你就在 YouTube 上刷了两个小时。顺便说一句，人们认为你是谁是由你的日记定义的。不，真正的你是当你睡不着时，晚上 10 点到 12 点之间在 YouTube 上看的视频。那是真正的你。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Williamson**: I'll give you mine. Okay. No phone in the bedroom at night. charge it outside. It's an instant 15% quality of life increase.

Because when you start your day, if you use your phone as your alarm, you roll over, you turn the alarm off, and immediately you're looking at your phone. You haven't got up, you haven't got moving, you're not hydrated, you're not seeing sunlight in your eyes, you are hit in the face by the world telling you what's happening as opposed to you having a tiny little microcosm of peace.

It also means if you can't sleep, you know, you can just roll over and pick your phone up and now you're two hours into a YouTube scroll hole. That's who you truly are. By the way, people think that who you are is, you know, your journal entries. No, no. Who you truly are are the videos that you watch on YouTube between 10 p.m. and 12:00 p.m. at night when you can't sleep. That's who you really are.

</details>

**Chris Williamson**: 另一个大的：**戒酒 6 个月**。

如果你戒酒大约六个月，它迫使你思考：我真的想去那个聚会吗？我实际上不得不麻醉自己才能和我周围的人在一起。如果你只能在喝酒时忍受和朋友在一起，那可能不是一个好迹象。如果你的朋友只希望你在喝酒时和他们在一起，他们不是朋友，他们是酒肉伙伴。

我在 30 岁时停止喝酒。在大约 31 岁时，我想，“再喝一杯吧”。它毁了我三天的生活。我喝了几杯酒，没醉。但它毁了我三天的生活，因为它引起的多米诺骨牌效应。那晚我睡得更差，第二天吃得更差，播客做得更差，没去健身房。

很多人想建立习惯。他们想建立冥想习惯，想更坚持去健身房。他们没有意识到，阻止他们做那件事的东西，就坐在他们每周四个晚上喝的那杯酒的杯底。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Williamson**: No alcohol for 6 months. This is a big one.

But if you take alcohol out for about six months, what it forces you to do is think, do I really want to go to that party? I'm actually having to anesthetize myself of the people that I'm around. Like, if you can only bear to be around your friends when you're drinking, that's probably not a good indication. And if your friends only want you to be around them when you're drinking, they're not friends, they're drinking partners.

I stopped drinking at 30 years old. And then at like I don't know maybe I was at 31. I thought, you know, I'll have a drink again. It ruined three days of my life. I had a couple of glasses of wine, didn't get drunk. It ruined three days of my life because of the the domino effect it caused. I got worse sleep that night. I ate more poorly the the next day... I podcasted worse. I didn't go to the gym.

Dude, so many people want to build habits. They want to build meditation routine. They want to go to the gym more consistently. They don't realize that the thing that's stopping them from doing that is sat at the bottom of the glass of wine that they have four nights a week.

</details>

### 效率畸形症与拖延

**Steven Bartlett**: 那么关于生产力呢？在这个时候，人们在思考拖延症，试图做更多的事情。我认为很多内疚感来自于感觉我们没有效率。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: What about matters of productivity? Do you think much about this? Because again, this time of year, people are thinking about procrastination, productivity. And I think a lot of the guilt does come from feeling like we're unproductive.

</details>

**Chris Williamson**: 绝对的。有一个很棒的概念叫**效率畸形症 (Productivity Dysmorphia)**。这是无法看到自己的成功，无法承认自己产出的数量。它位于倦怠、冒名顶替综合症和焦虑的交汇处。

追求生产力刺激我们做得更多，同时剥夺了我们品尝沿途取得的任何成功的能力。很多人每天醒来都觉得好像已经落后了。只有当他们完美地主宰了一整天，他们才能把自己拖回到某种最低水平的可接受产出。只有那样，他们当晚才能入睡而不觉得自己是个失败者。这意味着你的设定点是“亏损”，如果你这一天表现极佳，你最多只能打个平手。你永远赢不了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Williamson**: Absolutely. Yeah. There's a wonderful idea called productivity dysmorphia. So, it's the inability to see your own success. It's like uh to acknowledge the volume of your own output. So it sits at the intersection of burnout, imposttor syndrome, and anxiety.

Basically like the pursuit of productivity spurs us to do more while robbing us of the ability to savor any of the successes that we achieve along the way. But a lot of people have this sense of productivity debt. They wake up every day feeling as if they're already behind. And only if they dominate their entire day perfectly can they drag themselves back up to some minimum level of acceptable output. And only then can they go to sleep that night without feeling like a loser. This means that you your set point is loss and the best thing that you can do if you crush the day is get to a draw. You never win.

</details>

**Chris Williamson**: 关于拖延，据我所见，主要有两个原因。

第一个是你不知道该做什么。你面前有这本大书，但没人写过“一本书”。他们写一个句子，然后那个句子随着时间积累成页和段落。你需要做一个**下一步行动 (Next Action)**。我正在拖延一项任务。我可以做的下一个物理动作是什么，能推动我朝那个目标前进？我需要写一封邮件。那你最好去打开你的邮件客户端。如果你不打开邮件客户端，你就不可能发送邮件。

第二个原因是你不知道怎么做。这是一个技能问题。我知道我必须在这个电子表格上做一个 VLOOKUP，但我不知道怎么做。那就去问 ChatGPT，去谷歌，打电话给朋友。

所以对我来说，拖延通常是因为这两件事之一：定义不清的下一步物理行动，或者技能问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Williamson**: As far as I can see, there's two main reasons for procrastination.

The first one is you don't know what to do. So, you have this big book in front of you, but nobody's ever written a book. they've written a sentence and then that sentence has accumulated over time into pages and paragraphs. You do what's called a next action. So, I'm procrastinating over a task. What is the next physical action that I can do that pushes me toward that goal? I need to write an email. Well, you better go and open your email client. If you don't have your email client open, it is impossible for you to send the email.

Second thing, you know what to do, but you don't know how to do it. So you can sit down in front of the spreadsheet and you know that you've got to do a VLOOKUP on this spreadsheet. We have no idea how to do a VLOOKUP. Um Chat GPT, Google, ring a boss, ring a friend.

So for me, when I look at my procrastination, it occurs due to usually one of two things. Poorly defined next physical action... Or a skill issue.

### 个人成长的“孤独篇章”

**Steven Bartlett**: 你之前提到了一个词，“孤独篇章 (The Lonely Chapter)”。我想这是当你追求大目标时会发生的后果。给我解释一下什么是孤独篇章。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: You mentioned a word earlier on. You you said the word briefly. I guess this lonely chapter idea is a consequence of what will happen when you go in pursuit of a big goal. Explain to me what the lonely chapter is.

</details>

**Chris Williamson**: 孤独篇章描述了你生命中的一段时期：你已经发展到无法真正与旧的朋友群体产生共鸣，但还没有发展到足以建立新的朋友圈。

例如，你决定戒酒。你可以和想去酒吧的朋友一起出去，但你会感到有点被排斥。你的改变在你和他们之间制造了摩擦。如果你的朋友不和你以同样的速度成长，你们就不再说同一种语言了。

这非常不舒服，因为回到你习惯的旧生活是很诱人的。最初的悲哀现实是，在你的个人成长旅程中，某个时刻你可能需要抛下一群没有和你以同样速度成长的朋友。

我希望所有的起源故事都能更多地关注这一点。似乎在每个英雄的旅程中，一旦他们承诺从现在的状态去往他们想去的地方，他们的自信从未动摇过。根据我的经验，根本不是那样。你的整个个人成长旅程都充满了怀疑、自怜和不确定性。这并不性感。这不酷。

这就是为什么回到旧模式更容易。我认为我喜欢“孤独篇章”这个概念的原因是，它命名了很多觉得这是一个错误而不是个人成长特性的人所感受到的东西。我可以向你保证，每一个从不想待的地方去到想待的地方的人，都不得不经历这个孤独的篇章。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Chris Williamson**: The lonely chapter describes a time in your life where you're so developed that you can't really resonate with your old set of friends, but you're not yet sufficiently developed that you've built a new set of friends.

For instance, you have decided to stop drinking. You can go out with your friends that want to go to the pub, but you feel a little bit ostracized. So your change is creating some friction between you and them. If your friends don't grow at the same pace as you, you don't speak the same language.

And it's very uncomfortable because it's tempting to go back to the old life that you're used to. The initial sad reality is that on your journey of personal growth, at some point you may need to leave a group of friends behind who aren't growing at the same pace as you.

And I I wish that they paid more attention to it. Seems to me that on every hero's journey, as soon as they make the commitment to go from where they are to where they want to be, their self-belief never waver. In my experience, that's not the way it is at all. Like your entire journey of personal growth is just steeped in doubt and self-pity and uncertainty. It's not sexy. It's not cool.

And this is exactly why it's so much easier to just go back to your old patterns. And I think the reason that I love this lonely chapter idea is that it it names something that a lot of people feel is a bug, not a feature of personal growth. I can promise you that every single person who has gone from a place where they didn't want to be to one where they did has had to go through this lonely chapter.

### 贝塔区域悖论 (Region Beta Paradox)

**Chris Williamson**: 这就是**贝塔区域悖论**。想象一下，如果你要走不到一英里的路，你会走路。如果你要走一英里或更远，你会开车。矛盾的是，你走两英里比走一英里还要快。因为你会跳上车。

这表明，如果我们只在事情越过某个“糟糕阈值”时才采取行动，那么“更糟糕”的情况可能比“仅仅是糟糕”的情况要好。

例如，一个人住在公寓里，有点发霉，室友有点怪，但很便宜，离工作地点不远。或者一个人在一段关系中，伴侣不虐待他们，但他们并没有真正感到兴奋。或者一个人的老板有点混蛋，薪水不高，但工作很轻松。所有这些人，如果他们的情况更糟，他们可能会过得更好，因为那会激励他们去采取行动。

人们陷入的这种舒适的自满区是非常危险的。事情还没有坏到足以被称为坏，但也远没有好到足以被称为好。你坐在这个灰色地带，这个生产力的炼狱里。

**Chris Williamson**: That's the region beta thing. So um the region beta paradox. Imagine that if you were going to travel less than a mile, you'd walk it. If you're going to travel a mile or more, you would drive it. Paradoxically, you would travel 2 miles quicker than you would travel one mile. You jump in the car.

And what this suggests is that if we only act when things cross a certain threshold of badness, worse things can be better than better things.

For instance, the person who lives in an apartment and there's a little bit of mold... and the housemates's kind of a bit weird, but it's really cheap and not too far from their work. Uh, someone's in a relationship and their partner's not abusive... but they're not really that fired up. Or the person who's got a job and their boss is a bit of a dick and it doesn't pay that well, but it's really cushy. All of these people would be better off if their situations were worse because it would galvanize them to go and do something.

And this zone of comfortable complacency that people get into is where they can sit for a very long time. Things aren't bad enough to be bad, but they're nowhere near good enough to be good. You sit in this sort of gray zone, this sort of like productivity purgatory.

### 霉菌中毒与至暗时刻

**Steven Bartlett**: 我要问你一个问题，我想让你大声思考。你快乐吗？

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Steven Bartlett**: I'm going to I'm going to ask you a question. Can you think out loud when you hear this question? Are you happy?

</details>

**Chris Williamson**: 这是一个复杂的问题。有时我必须努力工作才能保持好心情。今年对我来说特别艰难，因为我在健康方面受到了重创。美国是一个很棒的国家，但一切都试图杀死你。我住在一个有有毒霉菌的房子里。我得了霉菌中毒。

我花了将近两年的时间做两份工作。一份是节目，另一份是试图修复我的健康。今年年初我只有两个目标：不要让节目质量下降，修复我的健康。

我真的被羞辱了，被踢了无数次蛋蛋。这感觉像是一个宇宙玩笑。感觉太不公平了。每天晚上 7 点上床睡觉，持续六个月，却无法入睡，因为我的皮质醇倒置了。晚上皮质醇比早上还高。无论我睡多久，早上醒来从未感到休息过。

霉菌通常会影响三件事：能量、情绪和认知。它让你一直感到疲倦。它让你情绪低落。它让你健忘。有一天我低下头，忘记了怎么系鞋带。我忘记了单词，忘记了朋友的名字。

所以今年不是我试图最大化幸福的一年。这是我试图生存的一年。我几乎是默默地做这件事的。

**Chris Williamson**: It's complex question. I have to work hard to be in a good mood sometimes. Uh well, this year has been a particularly difficult one for me because I got kicked in the nuts by health. America's a wonderful country, but everything's trying to kill you. I lived in a house that had toxic mold. I got mold poisoning.

And I spent a long time, the best part of two years, with two jobs. One was the show, the other was trying to fix my health. My only two goals for this year at the start of this year were don't let the show drop and fix my health.

So I really was humbled, like kicked in the nuts so many times. It felt like a cosmic joke. It felt so unfair. going to bed at 7 o'clock at night for six months, unable to sleep because I was wired but tired because my cortisol was inverted. Cortisol was higher at night than it was in the morning. So no matter how long I slept, I was never able to feel rested in the morning.

So mold does typically three things. Uh energy, mood, and cognition. So it makes you tired all the time. It makes you low mood. And it makes you forgetful. Like there was a day when I looked down and I forgot how to tie my shoes. I was forgetting words, forgetting the names of friends.

So this year has not been a year where I've been trying to maximize my happiness. It's one where I've been trying to sort of survive. And I did it pretty much silently.

### 结语：能动性 (Agency)

**Steven Bartlett**: 我们有一个结束传统，最后一位嘉宾给下一位嘉宾留一个问题。留给你的问题是：你认为必须优先保留的人类快乐和努力的最重要组成部分是什么？

**Steven Bartlett**: We have a closing tradition where the last guest leaves a question for the next. And the question left for you is quite relevant. What is the most important component of human joy and endeavor that you believe must be preserved in priority?

</details>

**Chris Williamson**: 哦，太棒了。我认为是**能动性 (Agency)**。

我认为是你拥有影响周围环境能力的信念。因为能动性的反面是你基本上举起双手说：“我受世界的摆布。”

是你对生活发生作用，而不是生活发生在你身上。

<details>

**Chris Williamson**: Oh, wonderful. I think agency.

I think the belief that you have the ability to impact your surroundings. Uh because the opposite of agency is you basically holding your hands up and saying, "I'm at the mercy of the world. You happen to life. Life doesn't happen to you."
