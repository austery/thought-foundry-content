### 采购的复杂性与初创机会

**Vlad**: 如果你想造一架飞机，就必须引入成千上万家供应商。有人发来一封确认函：“抱歉，这个零部件将延迟两周到货。”如果他们漏掉了这封信，损失可能高达数亿美元。**企业采购**历来是高度孤立割裂的，而如今它牵涉到法务、财务、大量不同的软件系统以及各色人员。对 AI 初创公司而言，这里的机会在于可以说：“我们要从头到尾接管这整个端到端流程。”

没有哪家企业会从第一天起就完全采用全自动的谈判 Agent。为什么？因为他们打一开始就不信任我们，也不信任这项技术。得益于**人机协同**（human-in-the-loop）模式，我们为 Agent 注入反馈与行业专业知识；久而久之，在经历了一万次、两万次乃至十万次谈判后，他们开始对我们建立起信任。

当你思考一家具有可持续发展力的**垂直 AI** 公司应该具备什么特质时，你看重哪些方面？预测未来的竞争护城河其实非常困难。纵观所有顶尖企业，在早期阶段他们往往……

**Vlad**: If you want to build an airplane, you need to attract thousands of suppliers. Someone sends a confirmation: "Hey, sorry, this part will arrive 2 weeks late." And if they miss this letter, it's hundreds of millions in losses. Procurement has historically been more siloed, and now it involves lawyers, finance, a bunch of different software systems, and people. The opportunity for an AI startup is to say, "We're going to take control of this entire process from start to finish." No company or enterprise starts with fully autonomous negotiation agents from day one. Why? Because they don't trust us and they don't trust the technology from day one. Thanks to the human-in-the-loop approach, we infuse our agent with feedback and knowledge, and over time they start to trust us in 10,000, 20,000, 100,000 negotiations. When you think about what a sustainable vertical AI company looks like, what qualities do you look for? It is very, very difficult to predict your protective barrier in the future. If you look at all the best companies, in the early stages they were...

**Elina**: 欢迎回到 **a16z** 播客。我是 **Elina Berglund**，今天与我同行的有 a16z 合伙人 **Seema Amble**，以及 **Leo** 的联合创始人兼 CEO **Vlad Kyle**，Leo 是一家专注于为企业采购打造 AI Agent 的公司。

Seema，你最近写了一篇名为《巨头来袭》（*The Incumbents Are Coming*）的文章，其中提出了几乎每家 AI 初创企业都会面临的尖锐问题：如果一家成熟的知名软件巨头已经拥有客户基础和业务数据，而且基础模型也能在其现有工具体系中运作，那么初创公司的优势到底在哪里？今天我们邀请到了 Vlad，他能切实帮助我们理解初创公司的优势究竟何在。

我想我们可以先从市场上支持与反对现有巨头的核心论据聊起。如果现有软件公司能给自己的软件接入强大的 AI Agent，那么新应用的空间在哪里？其独特优势又是什么？

**Elina**: Welcome back to the a16z podcast. I'm Elina Berglund, and today I'm joined by Sima Embl, a partner at a16z, and Vlad Kyle, co-founder and CEO of Leo, a company that builds AI agents for corporate procurement. Simo, you recently wrote an article called "The Incumbents Are Coming," where you posed a question that almost every AI company faces: if a well-known software vendor already has customers and data, and the model works in its tools, what is the advantage of a startup? We have Vlad, and he can really help us understand what the startup advantage is. So, I think it's worth starting with the arguments "for" and "against" the market leaders. So, if a company can connect a powerful AI agent to its software, where is the place for another application and what is its advantage?

### 现有巨头与AI初创公司的角逐

**Seema**: 让我先退一步，梳理一下当前的宏观背景。历史上我们通常认为，一边是老牌市场巨头，一边是新锐初创企业，双方在进行激烈的博弈——引用我合伙人 Alex Rampell 的话来说，这是一场“分销渠道与创新速度之间的较量”。

但正如你指出的，现在出现了第三个变量：现有领军企业可以在原有产品之上直接叠加先进的模型能力，这便催生出了一个更难对付的市场竞争者。既然大家已经有了整合云平台与 **Salesforce** 的 **Agentforce** 体系，既有存量数据，员工又习惯了使用这些成熟系统，那为什么还需要一家 AI 初创公司？为什么还要购买另一款独立产品？

我依然坚信 AI 初创公司拥有极其清晰的立足点。初创公司的核心聚焦点在于：传统巨头受限于其原有的**记录系统**（system of record）以及所沉淀的数据结构，它们并没有从头到尾完成端到端的工作闭环。

让我举一个具体的案例来阐述。假设你是一名客户，打电话反映服务取消后仍然被扣费了。要彻底解决这个取消扣费的问题，绝不仅仅是客户进聊天窗口说一句“我被多扣钱了”，然后客服系统回一句那么简单。为了真正解决问题，必须对接计费系统、调取完整的聊天历史、审查服务合同。这绝不是单一一套记录系统所能涵盖的，它涉及关于客户的全局上下文以及所有相关交互记录，是单一记录系统根本无法触达的盲区。

而 AI 初创公司的战略机遇就在于：“我们要接管整个端到端的流程。”这不仅适用于法律领域（从准备庭审材料到开庭全流程覆盖），也同样适用于采购领域。其核心思想就是拥有从头到尾的完整工作流闭环。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seema**: So, let me step back a little and outline the situation. Historically, we thought there was a market leader and there was a startup, and they were fighting—it was a fight between distribution and innovation, to quote my partner Alex Rempell. Um, but now there's this third element that you're pointing out, which is that the leading company can add one of the models on top, and then a much more serious competitor appears on the market. So why do you need an AI startup when you have CloudForce, which takes the cloud and Salesforce, combines them, and, you know, you already have all the data, and your employees are already used to using this product. So why another product? Um, I'm still absolutely convinced that there's obviously a case for an AI startup, and they're really focused on the fact that a legacy company is limited by their accounting system and the data they have, and they're not doing the job from start to finish. Let me explain this with a more specific example. Um, let's say you're a customer and you call and say you were charged after you canceled the service. This, um, resolving the cancellation history— it's not just, you know, a customer comes into the chat and says, "Hey, I was overcharged." And the answer to this: you need to contact billing, view the entire chat history, and review the contract. This is not one accounting system, it is knowledge about the customer and everything they interact with, and this is something that one accounting system will not cover. But the opportunity for an AI startup is to say, "We're going to take over this whole end-to-end process." This could be a legal area, for example, covering the entire process from preparation of materials to trial. Well, I can talk more about procurement, but it's really the concept of owning the entire workflow from start to finish.

</details>

**Elina**: 确实如此。Vlad，你能谈谈这在采购领域具体是如何体现的吗？在哪些具体环节，现有巨头外加一个大模型就远远不够用了？你在合作的企业中看到了什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elina**: Yes. Vlad, do you want to tell me where exactly this manifests itself in procurement? Where an existing leader plus a model is simply not enough, and what have you seen in the companies you work with?

</details>

### 采购流程中冰山之下的暗流

**Vlad**: 当人们想到采购时，大多数人脑海里浮现的可能就是价格，对吧？也就是最终敲定的成交价是多少。奇怪的是，系统里的记录总是显得极其简单明了：比如结果就是 8,000 美元。

销售领域其实也是一模一样的情形。即使我去找 Seema 告诉她：“我们现在正与另一家公司展开合作，看，合同上已经签好了字。”表面上看起来轻轻松松，但 Seema 并没有看到这背后付出的所有艰辛努力：背后可能有 30 次利益相关者会议、500 封往来邮件、20 张不同的 Excel 表格。

对向交易对手采购而言也是同理。你在 **ERP** 系统里看到采购铝材的花费是 8,000 美元，但系统里根本看不到供应商最初开出了 10,000 美元的报价，看不到成本预估工程师整整花了三周时间跑 Excel 电子表格和 3D 模型去测算零部件价格。

这就是我们看到的现状：采购领域中绝大部分实际发生的工作，其实都游离在 ERP 或任何记录系统之外。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Vlad**: Well, when we think about procurement, I guess most people think about prices, right? So, what is the final price we agreed on? And, strangely enough, the recording always looks very, very simple and easy. It's just 8 thousand. This is the result, for example. And I mean, it's all the same in sales, right? So, even if I go to Sima and tell her, “Hey, we’re now collaborating with another company. Look at this signature on the contract." It looks very simple, but Seema doesn't see all the work behind it, does she? So, there were maybe 30 stakeholder meetings, 500 emails, 20 Excel spreadsheets, and the same goes for procurement from the counterparty, right? So you see 8 thousand for aluminum in your ERP system, but you don't see that perhaps the supplier has made a counterclaim and asked for 10 thousand. You don't see that the estimating engineer spent three weeks working with Excel spreadsheets and 3D modeling to figure out part prices and everything else. This is what we see. So most of the work in procurement actually happens outside of this ERP or any accounting system.

</details>

**Elina**: 是的，在你刚才描述的这套复杂工作流中，一个 Agent 可以承担大量的工作，不同种类的 Agent 也能各司其职。

这正好引出了下一个问题：大约一年前，许多市场参与者纷纷推出各种聊天机器人，当时市面上几乎全都是这种形态。但 Seema 在文章中提到了四种截然不同的 Agent 类别：大家熟知的**搜索 Agent**（search agents）、**流程 Agent**（process agents）、**策略 Agent**（policy agents）以及**委托人 Agent**（principal agents）。

你能否详细介绍一下这四类 Agent，并解释每一类在做出业务判断所需的认知复杂度上究竟发生了怎样的跃迁？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elina**: Yes. Yes. And I'm sure that in the workflow you described, an agent can do a huge number of things, and different types of agents can also perform many tasks. And this is actually a good bridge to the next question: a year ago, I think, many market players were releasing chatbots, and that was pretty much all you could see. But, Simo, in this article you wrote, you highlight four different types of agents. The search agents we are used to are process agents, policy agents, and principal agents. So can you tell us about each of them and explain what exactly changes in the judgments required for each of them to work?

</details>

### Agent进化的四个演进阶段

**Seema**: 好的。一年前我曾做过一个关于“做个聊天机器人”策略的表情包：当时所有大企业基本上都是在自家系统上架设一个聊天机器人，用户可以跟它对话来检索信息，或者进行一些轻量级的统计分析。这其实完完全全属于第一类——搜索 Agent。

为了更易于理解，我依然用客户服务的场景来分别举例说明搜索 Agent、流程 Agent、策略 Agent 和委托人 Agent：

假设你是一名客户，遭遇了服务宕机，于是打电话来要求对本次宕机进行赔偿。现有软件供应商可能提供的**信息检索型助手**会去查询并确认：“是的，合同条款中确有提及，而且系统记录显示当时确实发生了故障。”它只是从数据库中调取客户数据并进行呈现，或者做个简单的摘要。

第二种类型，也就是第二阶段，是**流程 Agent**。这个流程 Agent 具备批准发放补偿额度的执行能力，它会说：“根据我们的操作手册政策，服务在特定日期中断，因此系统判定你有权获得补偿。”它可以在既定审批流程内直接在账户上应用这项减免。这个过程不需要主观价值判断。

进而演进到**策略 Agent**，它不单单是按图索骥地走流程，它会介入判断：“这次故障虽然只持续了 20 分钟，但在该业务场景下，已经足以被定性为严重故障。”由于业务条款往往缺乏黑白分明的定量定义，它必须动用策略维度的判断力。

而在最后的最高阶形态——**委托人 Agent**（执行决策代表）中，它实际上在进行宏观权衡：“考虑到这次故障体验非常糟糕，而且我们极度重视维护与该客户的长期商业关系，我们应当主动给予超出常规流程和标准策略规定上限的超额赔偿。”

这四个阶段的关键意义在于：市面上绝大多数现有巨头即使有所动作，也绝大部分停留在第一类（信息检索）；现在它们最多声称正在向流程与策略迈进，试图应用更多逻辑判断。但纵观它们真正发布的成果，基本还是偏向辅助性质的工作流助手，帮你签个字或者提取会议纪要录入表单而已。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seema**: Yes. A year ago, I created this meme about the "build a chatbot" strategy, which was that all large companies essentially had a chatbot on top of their accounting system that you could talk to to get information or do some light analytics. And this really fit into that first category —search agents. And maybe let me give an example of each of them— search agent, process, policy, and principal—using the example of customer service, just because it's easier to understand. So, imagine you're a customer, there's a service outage, and you call to say, "Hey, I want to get compensated for this outage." The information retrieval assistant that an incumbent supplier might have will be able to find, "Yeah, you know, this is what was said in the contract terms, and yeah, there was a failure." And just confirm this information. It pulls customer data from a database and simply shares it, perhaps summarizing it. The second agent, or the second step in the agent sequence, is the process agent. So, this process agent can provide credit approval and say, "Okay, according to our policy manual, the service was unavailable on these dates." "That's why we say you're entitled to compensation." And he can just apply it to the account within the due process. No judgments are needed here. Then, going to the policy agent, it doesn't just apply the process, it says, "Okay, in this situation, the failure lasted 20 minutes." "That's enough to consider it a significant failure." And they apply this judgment because there is actually no clear definition of the term. And in the final stage, where the lead agent works, you're actually weighing up, "Okay, should we offer more compensation, because this was a pretty terrible failure and we want to preserve the relationship, so it's worth doing more than the processes or the policy require." The importance of these four stages lies in the fact that most existing companies, if they started at all, started in the first category. Now they at least say they are moving towards processes and policies, which means they will be able to apply more judgment. And if you look at what they've launched, these are workflow agents that will help you sign a document or enter information from a transcription, or something like that.

</details>

### 巨头的内在阻力与分销优势

**Seema**: 他们依然被牢牢限制在信息检索和部分机械流程的范围内，尚未涉足更复杂的价值判断。我可以解释背后的原因：存在太多的内部利益机制在制约着他们。

当然，这些传统企业也在努力突破。当发现自身技术存在短板时，促使他们考虑与 **OpenAI**、**Anthropic** 等前沿实验室展开战略合作，借助前沿大模型的能力来弥补自身短板，从而形成更强大的合力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seema**: They are still very limited to information retrieval and partly processes. They haven't yet reached more complex judgments, and I can explain why. There are many incentives that prevent them from doing so. But these companies are trying, and I think what they can't do on their own is making some of them think, "Okay, let me partner with OpenAI, Anthropic, or one of the labs to try to leverage their modeling capabilities and complement what they have and make it significantly stronger."

</details>

**Elina**: 确实，甚至可能向客户额外收费。你愿意多聊聊为什么那些成熟巨头会止步不前、自我设限吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elina**: Yes. Or charge, I would say. Yes. Well, do you want to tell me why some incumbents are holding back?

</details>

**Seema**: 与其说他们是在主动克制，不如说他们是受到了客观体制的制约。

毫无疑问，他们渴望全力推进，但事情有正反两面。

一方面，他们享有巨大的**分销渠道优势**，拥有既有的客户信任，这使得他们能向老客户交叉销售更多产品。以 Salesforce 为例，当 Agentforce 发布时，客户很容易做出决策：“好啊，我想开通一个 Salesforce Agent，特别是如果这几乎不需要额外付费的话。”基于这种深厚的信任与渠道渗透，把产品推销出去往往轻而易举。

但另一方面，他们面临着深层的**内部动力冲突**。当你试图迈向高阶决策 Agent 时，现有提供工作流工具的产品线与直接取代人类干活的自动化产品之间必然产生零和博弈。这是完全不同的两种产品哲学：彻底从头到尾解决客户支持问题，与为人工客服提供辅助工作流支持，面向的是完全不同的买家与预算。

这两个团队如何协同？在销售层面你究竟该向客户兜售哪套理念？这是老牌领军企业面临的经典困境：两位来自不同业务部门的副总裁各自背负着不同的产品销售指标，在考核激励导向和目标客群上永远无法达成一致。这是大企业不可避免要遭遇的组织痼疾。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seema**: Yes. Well, I would say that they are not so much restraining themselves as being restrained. Of course. Um, yes, I'm sure they want to go full force, but there are two sides to this. First, they have a distribution advantage, right? They have the trust of customers, which allows them to sell more products to those customers. Here, let's take Salesforce. When Agent Force launched, it was very easy for customers to say, "Yes, I'll sign up for a Salesforce agent." "Especially if it was offered at almost no additional cost." Um, and because they have that trust and distribution, getting the product connected is usually pretty easy. On the other hand, there are problems with intrinsic motivation, right? That is, if you move to more complex agents, there is an internal conflict between the existing product offering the workflow and you, who directly performs the work. These are two different products: for example, when you solve a customer support problem from start to finish, versus providing a workflow for a support agent, a human. These are different buyers. How do you, well, you know, these two teams conflict, and besides, from a sales perspective, what exactly are you offering the client? And this is often a classic problem of incumbent market leaders, right? This is when there are two vice presidents, right? They are from different departments, sell different products, and they can never agree on what incentives are right and who to sell to. But, be that as it may, there are all these classic problems that leading companies face.

</details>

**Elina**: 讲得通。Vlad，在这个由搜索、流程、策略到委托人 Agent 的光谱中，Leo 目前处在什么位置？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elina**: Logically. Vlad, where on this spectrum— search agent, process agent, policy agent, executive agent— is Leo?

</details>

### 建立信任：人机协同与闭环学习

**Vlad**: 我可以肯定地说，我们全面覆盖了上述所有四个类别。这完全取决于业务任务的复杂程度以及 Agent 所承担的潜在风险。在 Leo 内部，我们已经有相当一部分场景实现了百分之百的全自动自主运行，而在某些场景下依然保留人在回路。这取决于预算审批权限、业务复杂度与风险承受度。

回到 Seema 谈到的信任问题，她探讨的是企业内部的组织信任，但我认为还有同样关键的**外部信任**问题：你如何说服企业客户跨越认知鸿沟，从“它只是个提取信息和跑流程的小工具”，转变到“让它完全自主做主”？这不仅涉及技术能力，更核心的是人性的信任建立。

作为一家初创公司或处于快速扩张期的企业，我们必须从零赢得这份信任。市场巨头天生自带信任光环，但这也意味着一旦过早推出不成熟、决策失准的半成品，他们就会迅速败光好感。

这是我们的核心发力点。令我们非常惊喜的一点是：最初那些机械的流程 Agent（比如发票审核 Agent），对我们来说其实变成了一个顺带解决的基础任务。系统提取发票信息，与其他单据交叉比对，再同步回 **SAP** 或 **Oracle**。这是一个非常确定、规整的既定流程。

我们很快意识到：市面上现存的传统财务软件其实覆盖的只是这部分工作，但这仅仅占真正需要解决的业务问题的 20%。剩下的 80% 往往在于：如果这张发票疑似欺诈怎么办？如果双方对金额产生分歧怎么办？如果出现异常情况怎么办？因此我们迅速跨越到了下一阶段——专门处理此类业务异常的智能 Agent。

我们之所以能说服客户，是因为我们始终保持适度超前，为他们提供下一代 Agent 解决方案。三年前我们起步时，核心功能只是从文档中提取数据，今天看来这平平无奇，但在三年前却惊艳众人。我们敏锐地识别到了企业愿意为此买单的真实痛点，并在几周内交付上线。如今我们在流程 Agent、全自动谈判 Agent 以及长周期复杂任务 Agent 上如法炮制：带着愿景与产品深入客户，摸清深层症结，然后以极快的速度工程落地。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Vlad**: Yes, we cover, I would say, all of those categories, and it really depends on the complexity and the risk that our agents are taking, right? So, sometimes Leo and I already have cases where we work completely autonomously. Sometimes a person remains in the control loop. It really depends on budget approval, complexity, and risk level. But perhaps, going back to what Sima said about trust in leading companies, you were talking about internal trust. I think there's also the issue of external trust, right? So how do you convince someone to go from "it's just an agent that pulls information and maybe runs processes" to "doing something completely autonomously"? Obviously, there is a technological component, but the main thing is the human factor, you need to trust them. Um, and we, as a startup or a company at the scaling stage, have to earn this trust. Market leaders already have trust, but that also means they can lose it if they release something too early and the product doesn't work, is of poor quality, or makes the wrong decisions. So, this is what we can do. And what's interesting, or rather what really surprised us, is that these process agents have become a kind of side task for us when we talk about the invoice processing process or invoice agents as a process. So, we get some information, compare it with other documents, and then transfer it back to SAP or Oracle. This is a very clear, understandable process. And then we realized: okay, this is 100% of the software market, right? This is accounting software. That's how it's created today, but in reality, it's only 20% of the total work that needs to be done, or of the problem itself. Because 80% of the problem is, for example, what to do if the account is fraudulent? What to do if there is a disagreement? What if we deviate from the standard scenario? And so we very quickly moved on to the next stage— agents that handle such exceptions. We convinced clients because we were probably lucky enough to always be a little ahead of the curve to offer them next- generation agents. For example, when we started 3 years ago, it was just pulling out a document. Today it's not impressive at all, but 3 years ago it was incredible. So we offered this to customers. We figured out, "Okay, this is a real problem." This is a real use case that they are willing to pay for. And then we were able to release it a few weeks later. We are doing the same now for the next step: for process agents, for fully autonomous agents, and for long-acting agents. We present it to them, find out what the problem is, and then we can implement it very quickly.

</details>

**Seema**: 区分内部信任与外部信任这个视角非常独到。换个角度来看：你固然需要企业采购你的软件，并在其内部工作流中充分信任它；但当初我们与 Vlad 初次见面时，最让我们震撼的一点在于，**Leo 的核心业务还涵盖对外商务谈判**。

这意味着客户必须完全信任 Leo 的 Agent 去代表自己直接与外部第三方交互博弈，这把信任的门槛推向了前所未有的高度。加之许多企业过去深受传统巨头画大饼却无法兑现的困扰，积攒了不少失望。我很想听 Vlad 聊聊，你们究竟是如何说服客户把对外谈判的重任放心托付给 AI Agent 的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seema**: I think the interesting point about trust is this internal versus external trust. Another way to look at it is— yes, you need your client to buy procurement software and trust it to use in their internal processes. But one of the really interesting things when we first met Vlad was that they are also in the business of negotiating. So, you have to trust that the Leo agent will then interact with the third party, and that's where that element of trust comes in. And of course, I think a lot of people feel cheated by the incumbent players because they, you know, are quite limited and haven't been able to deliver on what they've advertised in the past. So, putting that aside, I don't know, maybe Vlad, I'd like to hear a little bit about how you convinced clients to trust an AI agent to negotiate.

</details>

**Elina**: 顺便请你也向大家勾勒一下现代企业采购的真实全貌：你的客户画像是怎样的？他们过去习惯使用的都是哪些陈旧遗产系统？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elina**: Yes, and in doing so, can you also paint a picture of what procurement is, who your customers are, and what legacy systems they are used to?

</details>

### 万物皆采购：从螺栓到造飞机

**Vlad**: 当大众谈到采购时，脑海里联想到的可能只是日常买东西，或者像 C 端消费者那样在网上下单。但事实上，企业采购是驱动整个现代工业经济运转的庞大中枢系统，它深度贯穿了法务、工程、财务及采购等各个部门。所有重大决策都需要这些跨职能部门的通力协作。

我们之所以能说服他们，正如前面提到的：我们总是在认知与技术上领先半步。我们预见到了大模型浪潮的到来，甚至在 **ChatGPT** 引爆全球的前几周就已经着手开发，我们早早将科技圈探讨的技术潜能转化为企业切实可用的方案。无论是对话式 Agent、信息检索还是智能单据解析，我们敏锐抓住痛点后迅速在生产环境中落地交付。

这背后固然有人与人之间的承诺与信誉兑现，但从产品方法论上讲，没有哪家财富 10 强级别的巨无霸企业会在第一天就放任 AI 展开完全自主的商务谈判。

因此我们采用了**渐进式的人机协同方案**。即使我们打造出了一个在理论上极其出色的采购谈判专家 Agent，但对于某家具体的财富 10 强企业，我们根本不可能在一开始就获知其内部精细复杂的处事哲学与隐性规则。通过这种人机闭环机制，我们让一线业务人员持续给 Agent 喂养反馈与专业判断，客户随之逐步建立信任，从授权 Agent 谈判 1 万美元、2 万美元的订单，逐步放宽到 10 万美元的合同。

至于更长周期的重大项目谈判——比如涉及数百万美元、需要深度解析复杂 3D 机械图纸与工程图样的场景，我们始终有意识地在关键节点引入人类行业专家。Agent 可以自主运转数小时完成海量运算与比对，随后由成本估算工程师介入审核把关，Agent 再继续推进后续工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Vlad**: Yes. So when we think about procurement, we might think just about buying, or like in the B2C segment, where you just buy something. But it's actually a very intensive process that drives the economy, isn't it? And it covers many stakeholders and many departments: legal, technical, financial, and procurement. They all have to work on these solutions, and essentially when we.. I think the reason is how we convince them, as I said before: we're always a little bit ahead of the curve. We knew the technology was coming, so we started a few weeks before ChatGPT broke ground. We've already heard about all the problems and hype in, say, the tech bubble, and we've been able to offer that to businesses. We quickly realized that this could be an interesting use case, for example, chatbots, information search agents, or document processing. We identified the problem and quickly implemented it into production. Obviously, there is a human factor of trust: we promise something and actually implement it in our work. But there is also a product perspective, where we have a lot of experience: no company or enterprise starts with fully autonomous negotiation agents from day one. Nobody does this because they don't trust us and the technology from the start. So we take a simple approach with human involvement, and it helps us tremendously. We have, say, the perfect negotiating agent who is a great procurement specialist, but we don't know exactly how a particular Fortune 10 company works. With this approach, we feed our agent feedback and knowledge, and then they start to trust us to negotiate $ 10,000, $20,000, or $100,000. Um, and you also have other, longer-term agents. So, when we're talking about multi-million dollar negotiations where complex 3D models and technical drawings need to be analyzed. Um, we intentionally always involve experts there, right? The agent may work for a few hours, and then we ask for feedback from the cost estimating engineer, after which he performs the next part of the work. Um, and so on.

</details>

**Elina**: 这个环节非常值得深入探讨。在谈判过程中，你们具体是在哪个节点、通过什么方式让人类介入的？你提到了成本削减工程师，但在商业谈判中，这仅仅关乎成本测算数据，还是涉及其他需要人类把关的维度？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elina**: Perhaps it is worth dwelling on this in more detail. How exactly, where do you involve a person during the negotiation process? You mentioned a cost reduction engineer, but if you 're negotiating a deal, is that mostly about cost data, or is there anything else where people are involved?

</details>

### 物理世界的预测与概率把控

**Vlad**: 这很大程度上取决于谈判的金额与战略层级。我们必须明确区分两类谈判：第一类是企业过去受制于人力资源匮乏而根本无暇顾及的长尾谈判，现在借助 Agent，他们能够挖掘出过去想都不敢想的成本节约。

在 Leo 这样的 Agent 出现前，大企业通常会直接无视任何低于 5 万美元的支出，这也算给其他初创企业提供了一个生存小技巧：你给大企业开具一张 4 万美元的账单，他们很可能看都不看就直接付钱了，因为人工去逐笔核对谈判的成本远高于此。但如果他们部署了 Leo 的 Agent，我们就会代表客户对你严阵以待。

如果企业过去根本不去谈判，那么现在使用哪怕一个偶有疏漏的 Agent 去谈判，其潜在风险也是微乎其微的——就算没拿到最佳条件，也绝不会比原本全额支付更糟。

然而商业合作绝不仅仅是冷冰冰的金钱成本，它关乎深层的业务伙伴关系。即便在某些供应商身上的开销并不大，你依然需要维系良好的合作生态。比如播客录制或营销服务：这在整体预算中占比不大，但你与搭建摄影棚的团队建立了长期互信，他们深知 a16z 的录音习惯与质量要求，你绝不希望随意换成不熟悉的陌生外包。因此在这类场景中我们坚持人机协同，采购人员非常在乎伙伴关系、沟通措辞以及合作氛围。但在常规事务上，大部分操作已经能由 Agent 自主完成。

对于重大战略性项目，则是复杂的多阶段谈判。这里不仅关乎价格，更关乎法务条款设计、财务回款与结算架构、成本工程学结构以及综合商业条款。这背后依靠的不是初级后勤人员，而是深度通晓特定行业流程的高级业务专家，他们不断将业务见解注入到长周期的 Leo Agent 之中。这生动地证明了原本狭隘孤立的采购，如今已扩展为一个纵向交织着法务、财务、多种软件系统以及各领域专家的庞大协同网。

**Vlad**: Again, it depends on the level of negotiation, right? We have to distinguish between negotiations that businesses never did because of lack of resources, but now, by using agents, they can get savings they never even knew they had, right? Before agents or Leo came along, they just ignored anything under 50k, right? This could be a kind of life hack for other startups. You can just send a large company an invoice for 40 thousand. They probably won't bargain because they don't have time for it. Unless they have Leo agents, then we will negotiate against you. Otherwise, they will simply pay this bill. And, of course , what is the risk in not negotiating at all ? So what is the risk now of using a failed agent to negotiate? Almost zero, right? We may lose something in the negotiations, but it's still better than nothing. But still , we are talking about business relationships, and they are not always just about costs and money, right? You may not be spending a lot on a supplier, but you need that business relationship, right? A good example would be podcasts or marketing services. It's probably only a fraction of the cost, but you already have a clear business relationship with someone who is setting up the studio, and you don't want outsiders doing it, because they already know how the A16Z works and how you want to record everything. That's why we use a human-centered approach here, as procurement professionals care about relationships, the tone of communication, and how it works. But mostly autonomously. We also have another group of agents where we always involve a person, and it's like a multi-step negotiation process. It's also, well, it's not just about the price, right? Is this also, say, how the contract is drawn up? So we are talking about legal issues. How, for example, is the collection system designed? So we're talking about finances. Obviously, the cost structure, so we're actually talking about cost engineering. Next, we talk about commercial terms. Um, this is procurement. Um, and these are n't people from the back office. These are highly qualified specialists who have in-depth knowledge of the specific processes of a particular company and a particular industry. Um, and they're infusing these long-term Leo agents with these insights. This is another example of how procurement has historically been more limited, and now it, so to speak, touches on legal issues, finances, a bunch of different software systems, people, both narrow specialists and generalists.

**Elina**: Yes. Um, can we pin this to a specific client, or rather, not a client, but a specific vertical? For example, I am a drone manufacturer. I make humanoid robots or something like that. How many parts do I have to, you know, order and purchase? How many factories do I interact with? How many suppliers do I deal with? Just all these things. If you want to choose, Vlad, maybe a vertical that, you know, just manages all of this complexity with Leo, and just walk us through their experience.

### 端到端多Agent系统的协作架构

**Vlad**: 当 Leo 谈论采购时，我们指的绝不是买买笔记本电脑或订订铅笔。那些轻度需求我们三年前就能用 Agent 轻松解决了。我们关注的是制造大飞机、人形机器人、工业无人机这种高精尖制造场景，甚至打造支撑本轮 AI 繁荣所需的数据中心基建——这一切的基石都是采购。

要建造一架客机，你需要协调成千上万家供应商，新建配套工厂。在此类超大型工业项目中，极微小的供应链摩擦都会带来毁灭性的连锁反应。若某一个关键零件延误两周，整条生产线乃至整个工程都将被迫停摆，导致数亿美元的惨重损失。

前期的决策在于确定技术规格、物色最佳供应商。但决策完成后，背后充斥着海量看似枯燥但性命攸关的运营调度：某家供应商发来一封信说“抱歉，这个部件要推迟两周到货”，而这封邮件仅仅淹没在采购经理收件箱里每天 500 封日常邮件当中。如果采购人员错漏了这封邮件，就会造成几个亿的损失。这在工业界屡见不鲜，因为现有 ERP 记录系统里能看到的往往只有一行死板的日期变更，从本周三变成了下周三。

系统完全察觉不到背后的致命影响：这次两周延误究竟是无关痛痒，还是会导致上亿美元的重大损失？

必须有人或者智能体站出来解决这个问题。这正是我们 Agent 的职责所在：它们不仅负责接收抽取信息，更能评估其全局冲击力，并主动推演最佳应对方案。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Vlad**: Again, when we, like Leo, talk about procurement, we don't mean laptops or pencils. This, we believe, is also resolved by Leo agents, but it's simple. We decided this 3 years ago. Um, we're talking about when you want to build an airplane, robots, drones, or even, like we're doing a podcast right now about the hype around AI, but even AI has to be built. Um, and construction means procurement. For example, someone needs, if you build an airplane, you have to bring in thousands of suppliers. You need to build a factory to create this plane. Um, and even very small frictions can have a crazy impact, right? So, if you are running a very large project, like building a data center or an airplane, and one specific detail is delayed by 2 weeks, it can lead to losses of hundreds of millions of dollars and postpone the entire project. Therefore, all these decisions must be coordinated. One of the steps is to determine what exactly you need, which suppliers to work with, and who is the best to get that part. But when you have everything decided, there is operational work “ behind the scenes”, which may seem boring and unnecessary, but operational work is when someone sends a confirmation: “ Sorry, this part will arrive 2 weeks later”. And this is just one of the 500 emails in Outlook or Gmail from the purchasing manager. And if they miss this letter, hundreds of millions in losses. Done. And this happens regularly because the only thing they record in their accounting system is just the date. Right? That is, not this Wednesday, but next Wednesday. This is what you see in your system. But you don't see that maybe that's normal. Or maybe it's a loss of $100 million. Someone has to solve this , and that's what our agents do, right? They don't just receive information , they make decisions: does it affect anything? What exactly is the impact? And how can we solve this?

**Elina**: 当软件如此深地介入物理实体世界时，面对物理世界的不可抗力，你们究竟能施加多大影响？有些突发状况是人力无法左右的，比如货轮在海上遭遇风暴货物倾覆，或者港口道路瘫痪。在这些无法改变的现实面前，你们能从何处切入并带来实质性改变？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elina**: Yes. Ahem. When you are so deeply integrated into the physical world, what problems in the physical world can you influence? Some things, in my opinion, are simply impossible to solve: let's say a shipment arrives, some goods fall off the ship, or a street is blocked, or something else. There are things you can't influence, but there are also things you can. So where can you intervene and where will it really make a difference?

</details>

**Vlad**: 这归根结底是一个概率评估与风险对冲的问题。发生海损货物沉海确实无法逆转，但如果你掌握了跨组织的全局全景上下文，你就能提前做出精准的概率预测。

你可以通过历史数据精确测算出各个供应商的履约可靠度，评估物流防险方案。如果掌握了完整的上下文数据，你就会发现：A 供应商虽然价格便宜 10 倍，但有 20% 的缺货断供率；而 B 供应商的缺货率仅为 1%。在这种情境下，哪怕 B 供应商贵上 10 倍，你也理应选择 B，因为能最大限度确保整条生产线不停工。

这就是超越单一企业孤岛的跨组织上下文所具备的威力。Agent 不仅掌握企业内部的各种数据，还实时监控外部世界的动态：海量突发新闻动态、**Polymarket** 等预测市场的赔率波动、宏观供应链信号，并结合买卖双方的供需态势进行多维综合建模。

在长远维度上，结合这些全景上下文，我们能在整个商业流通链条中发挥巨大价值。这已经远超企业内部采购的范畴，而是关乎现代商业世界中企业与企业之间到底该如何进行跨组织协作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Vlad**: Yes, but it's really all a matter of probability, isn't it? Obviously, you can't change the situation if the cargo on the ship has been damaged. As with every example you gave, you can't change it, but if you have all the context, you can predict it. Mm. Because you can predict how reliable the supplier is. Of course? So, there are ways to protect the goods you ship. And if you have the full context, you have one supplier that is 20% out of stock and another that is only 1% out of stock. And maybe the one with the 20% shortage is 10 times cheaper, but in this case you're better off paying ten times more because you have a higher chance that the product will actually arrive. This is the most powerful thing because you have context beyond just one enterprise. We've talked about many stakeholders, but there's also the context of the outside world, right? So the agent must have the context of all the news that appears. Maybe even have a context for betting on Polymarket, like: "Okay, these crashes will happen." Then information from the supplier side, from the seller side, from the demand side. And combining all these contexts, I wouldn't say that there are any limitations in the long run. Of course, today we have different levels of probability, but we can help throughout the process, and that's what we're building at Leo. This is much bigger than just internal procurement. It's more about the interaction between companies, about how businesses do business with each other. That is, both from the buyer's side and from the supplier's side.

</details>

**Elina**: 你把 Leo 定义为一个**多 Agent 系统**（multi-agent system）。你能为我们描绘一下系统中各个不同的 Agent 分别在承担什么职责吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elina**: You described Leo as a multi-agent system. So can you describe what the different agents do?

</details>

### 间接采购与直接采购的本质差异

**Vlad**: 在宏观维度上，Leo 的 Agent 矩阵全面覆盖了 Seema 文章中提到的四类形态，根据复杂度和风险级别进行协同分工。

为了真正跑通从头到尾的闭环工作流，多个专能 Agent 必须严格按照业务时序进行高效的信息交互。之所以必须采用多 Agent 系统，是因为原本由 8 位业务人员、3 个部门和 5 种不同软件系统协同完成的人工流程，必须由一系列专业 Agent 形成矩阵网络进行无缝接力。只有多 Agent 架构才能实现端到端闭环。

三年前我们起步时，产品更像是一个类似 Copilot 的搜索增强工具；紧接着演进到单一 Agent；但很快我们发现，一个没有合同审查 Agent 或外部情报监控 Agent 配合的谈判 Agent，是绝不可能谈出理想结果的。

举个具体案例：比如波音公司要采购一批航空特种螺栓，这属于我们可以实现全自动化闭环采购的场景。

首先是需求感知：某位一线工程师或车间工人产生了采购需求。在传统模式下，工人可能两周才开一次电脑，迫使他们在极其繁琐的 SAP 界面中填报表单，很多人根本无法顺利提交。而在 Leo 的系统里，他们只需随手拍一张现场照片、上传一段零件编号或一份 Excel 表格即可。对于采购部门之外的人员，根本没人关心什么分类编码、总账科目或框架协议号。

随后系统中的各个 Agent 立即行动：一个 Agent 迅速检索企业各大库房的库存；另一个 Agent 联系兄弟工厂确认内部是否有多余调拨配件；若无内部库存，采购协调 Agent 调出合格外部供应商名单；询价单编制 Agent 迅速起草标准的询价函（**RFQ**）并通过邮件分发给供应商。

接着各家供应商发回报价：有的回信写得杂乱无章，有的直接把数字写在正文里，有的附带 PDF，有的发来 Excel。我们的解析 Agent 提取所有异构数据，比对历史价格。随后评估 Agent 研判是否存在议价空间，并根据预设规则自主裁定后续动作——是转入人工战略谈判，还是由自动谈判 Agent 启动在线竞价博弈。最后，系统自主完成订单确认、物流单号追踪直至发票对账全套流程。

在此基础上，下一步我们正在将其推进到更具挑战性的**直接采购**（direct procurement）领域。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Vlad**: At one level, Leo agents cover all four categories that Sima mentioned in her article. And this again depends on the risk and complexity. So we use them all. That is, several agents. But the other thing is that to get the job done from start to finish, these agents have to exchange information with each other. They have to do this in a very specific order. And when we talk about a multi-agent system, that's essentially what we're doing. We solve this problem from beginning to end. And since the human level of task execution involves eight people, eight stakeholders, three departments, and five different software tools, we need to cover all of that to get the job done completely. And these agents must then communicate with each other. Only with the help of a multi-agent system can the work be completed from start to finish. When we started, we obviously started with a search engine that was more like a co- pilot, about 3 years ago. But the next step was one agent. However, we quickly realized that you can't have a successful negotiation without a contract agent or an agent who monitors the news and all the things I described earlier. So, this is what we define as a multi-agent system. So if you have a bolt, for example, an airline needs to procure a bolt, let's say Boeing needs to procure a bolt. What exactly is the process for purchasing this bolt? And where exactly does Leo appear in this process ? Yes. This is one of those purchases that we can make completely autonomously. And we can do this thanks to this multi-agent system. So, first of all, someone has a need, right? They need to be informed about this somehow. And even this part is extremely difficult. You need to call someone. Maybe you open your laptop because you're a construction worker, for example. You only open your laptop once every two weeks, and now you are required to work in SAP or another ERP system. So you can't even apply. Here's how we do it very simply. You can take a photo, upload a code, or an Excel file—that's all you need to know about procurement. No one outside the purchasing department cares about categories, general ledger accounts, or framework agreements, no one is interested. We in the procurement world are concerned about this, but no one else is. And then our agents take action and check the warehouse stocks. They are clarifying the situation by asking another factory. Can we get these bolts internally? No, okay, then I'll contact the purchasing agent to see if we have any internal suppliers. Do we have external suppliers? Another agent should then prepare a request for quotation (RFQ) and send it via email. After that, a bunch of letters arrive. Some of them are complete nonsense. Some are simply written in the letter itself. Some of them are PDF files, others are Excel spreadsheets. We receive this information. Then we move on to the next step. Perhaps, based on our price comparison, there is an opportunity for negotiation. And then we have agents who essentially decide what to do next. Negotiation can mean strategic negotiations involving a person. This could mean autonomous negotiations. These can be auctions and electronic bidding. Calling a specific agent for negotiations. And then the entire process from A to Z: order confirmation, shipment tracking, invoices. And we are able to do this completely autonomously, taking into account the entire context. And, of course , the next important step is to do this for more complex details when we talk about direct procurement, where we also work.

**Elina**: 什么是直接采购？它与普通采购有何本质不同？

**Elina**: Yes. What is direct procurement?

### 复杂谈判中的实时洞察与后台辅助

**Vlad**: 刚才我描述的螺栓案例主要是关于业务流程的全自动化，通过消除重复繁重的低效工作来节约成本。

我们思考的维度是：企业每天重复做 1,000 次但恨不得一次都不用亲自动手的事有哪些？我们用全自动 Agent 去解决。但还有另一类机遇：企业目前根本没精力去做，但如果每天能做 1,000 次就能带来巨额财务回报的事是什么？那就是对以往从未议价的长尾支出进行自动化谈判。

这些大部分属于**间接采购**（indirect procurement）范畴——比如厂房运维、日常物料、笔记本电脑、营销咨询、甚至搭建当前这个播客演播室的开销。

而**直接采购**（direct procurement）则是指直接构成最终终端产品的核心零部件。制造飞机、无人机或机器人所必需的核心结构件就属于此类。在这个领域，供应商不再是成千上万家，通常只有 100 到 2,000 家核心供应商。这些供应商具备重大的战略价值，往往单一供应商每年的采购额就高达数亿美元甚至上百亿美元。

面对这种体量的核心供应商，你绝不可能派出全自动 Agent 几分钟草率搞定。这类谈判往往会持续整整三个月，需要工程专家极其周密地测算铝材、原油等大宗商品走势，对复杂图纸进行公差分析与成本拆解。在这类场景中引入 Agent 赋能，前景极其激动人心。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Vlad**: So, look, everything I just described is about automation, right? So, you can run this process completely autonomously and get even more savings as a result, right? We look at it this way: okay, what does this task look like from A to Z and what exactly needs to be done? What do they do 1,000 times a day but would actually like to do zero times? We've launched fully autonomous agents, but there are also opportunities to do things that they don't do at all right now, but if a business did that 1,000 times a day, it would have a huge impact on the bottom line. Autonomous negotiations on costs that have never been discussed before. This applies to indirect purchases— for example, maintenance, building a factory ( as in the Bold example), as well as laptops, pencils, marketing services, or setting up this podcast studio. These are all indirect costs, and we also have direct components. It's like building an airplane: there are all these suppliers whose parts you actually need to build an airplane, a drone, or a robot. And here we are not talking about 50,000 suppliers, but about 100 or a maximum of 2,000 suppliers. Um, and they are extremely strategically important, and you have maybe one supplier with a billion in spending. Therefore, you don't want to conduct autonomous negotiations. You want to have negotiations that last 3 months, where you are incredibly prepared and where your engineers analyze: okay, what is the situation in the aluminum industry? What is the situation in the oil industry? Hmm, how did the price change? Um, so you're actually checking all these drawings, you're quality controlling this part. And this is where it gets really exciting to implement agents.

</details>

**Elina**: 在这种高额直接采购场景中，通常是由资深工程专家与采购高管在台前主导，Agent 更多是在后台扮演军师的角色吗？未来的形态究竟是人类坐在谈判桌前握手，还是彻底由机器人代替人类谈判？它到底更偏向后台还是前台？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elina**: Yes, and for something like that, you would probably have engineering experts and other procurement professionals as the front office, and the agent would be more of a back office. Is this an idea? Is the agent: "Actually, you're sitting at a table, shaking hands, and it's a robot instead of a human negotiating?" "Um, is it.. So, what is it? Is it more back office or still front office?"

</details>

**Vlad**: 目前在涉及数千万、数亿美元的重磅谈判中，它明显更偏向于强大的**后台支持**。这类谈判 90% 的功夫都在于前期的周密准备。你在记录系统里看到的最终结果可能是“我们成功把 10 亿美元的采购额砍到了 9 亿”，但这背后凝结着 10 人专家团队整整 3 个月的全职深度准备。

但我们已经落地了一些**前台实时辅助**的惊艳用例。设想一下：当你我正在现场面对面谈判时，由于事先通过系统做了充分准备，随着谈判进行，我的屏幕上会根据对方的话语实时弹出由 Agent 计算生成的战术洞察。

比如对方提出：“最近国际原油价格上涨了 10%，所以我们的零部件报价必须上调 10%。”屏幕上会瞬间为我弹出提示：“原油指数确实上涨了 10%，但该供应商制造此部件的原油衍生原材料物料占比仅为 30%，因此合理的调价上限应当是 3% 至 4%，而非 10%。”有了这种实时交锋中的情报火力支援，前线谈判人员便能立于不败之地。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Vlad**: This, this, this is obviously more back office now, because you, you, you have these complex multi-million dollar negotiations. And this, this is again a great example. 90% of the work is preparation. The end result that you see in your accounting system is, "Oh, instead of $1 billion, I paid $900 million ." "Although it took 3 months of preparation and 10 people working on it full-time." Um, and obviously this happens in, um, the back office. But we actually have a few use cases where, um, it helps in real time as well. So, think about, um, let's say we're negotiating right now and I have perfect preparation. Just like with those, um, those notes that we have here. Um, imagine, while we're negotiating, I have real-time insights popping up on my screen where you tell me that the oil index has moved 10%. So, it grew by 10%. So that's why we need to raise prices by 10%. And I would immediately get a pop-up message: "It's true." "Oil has increased by 10%, but the product contains only 30% oil." So you, you, you shouldn't raise the price by 10%, maybe only by 4%. Um, so, yes. These are truly exciting use cases, even in real life.

</details>

**Elina**: 我们知道诸如 **Harvey** 和 **Decagon** 这样的垂直领域公司正在非常积极地进行下游模型的二次训练与微调。你们目前主要使用哪些基础模型？对于底层模型的后训练与微调，你们采取何种策略？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elina**: Yes, we know that companies like Harvey and Decagon are currently actively retraining models. Um, what exactly are the base models you use and how do you approach things like training or tuning?

</details>

### 专有数据模型与成本工程模型训练

**Vlad**: 我们广泛接入了各大模型供应商的通用基座模型，在某种意义上我们视基础模型为高度可替换的商品化基础设施。通用大模型在文档理解、生成 PDF 或 Excel 等常规通用业务任务上表现非常出色。

对于某些特定用例，通过巧妙组合基座模型与一系列专用工具链，确实能将任务完成度做到 100%。但还有许多工业级专业场景，即便你拿出了业界最强的基础模型并搭配顶尖的外围工具，最终也往往只能做到 80% 的效果。

一个典型例子就是成本工程分析：资深成本工程师拿到图纸后，能抽丝剥茧推导出该工件的物理真实成本底牌，这需要构建极其严密的成本工程模型。在这类场景中，我们已经着手通过专属工业工程数据来持续训练专业模型，力求跨越从 80% 到 100% 的质变门槛。

另一个例子是**价格基准对比**。理想状态下，任何人将一份报价单拖入系统，系统就能给出最客观公允的市场标杆底价。然而这些核心价格数据绝不是公网公开的信息，它们全部深锁在企业内部或跨企业的封闭私有账本中，通用大模型根本不可能学到。

因此我们不仅仅是在调优传统的文本大语言模型，我们还在探索训练直接面向最终业务确定性结果的端到端评估模型。举例来说，如果你同时拿到麦肯锡和 BCG 针对同一项目开出的报价单，两份方案可能都能完成任务，但报价可能相差 10 倍。普通人根本无法判定谁优谁劣，但有丰富实战经验的采购掌门人一眼就能凭借行业直觉做出准确判断。视频制作采购也是同理：如果你要求行家把视频采买定价的所有规则一字一句写下来，往往很难完全用硬编码规则穷尽，因为其中蕴含着大量隐性的经验常识。通过训练专门针对确定性评估结果的 Agent 模型，正是我们构筑核心技术护城河的关键方向。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Vlad**: Yes. We think it's possible...we use a lot of models from all the vendors, and we really see it as a commodity, right? So they have a good general business purpose, like reading, creating PDFs, and then creating Excel spreadsheets and all that. But we also believe that for some use cases, you can achieve a tremendous amount by combining the base model with certain tools, and perhaps get the job done 100%. But there are also cases where you can have the best base model and the best toolkit, whatever that means, but you'll still only achieve 80%. And, I would say, a good example of this is what cost- cutting engineers do during negotiations, right? They analyze the drawings. And then they determine how much this part should actually cost. That's why it's called proper cost modeling. And here, of course, there is an opportunity where we are already thinking and have started to train the model to reach 100% in this part. Another example is price comparison, where imagine you have a price quote, and in a perfect world you would just drag it somewhere and get the perfect price. But all this information is not publicly available, is it? This is all proprietary data based in one enterprise or across multiple enterprises. Therefore, general-purpose models cannot learn from this. Um, so we're, you know, thinking about not just teaching LLM; I think we're seeing models like Jeff emerging now, where you train them on text data, but the output is actually some kind of summary or just an ideal price. Um, and you can't do it with standard tools, because if you give me a quote from BCG and from McKinsey, they can do the same job, but the price can be ten times different. And I will have no idea which is better. But if you give it to a purchasing manager, he will immediately have a gut feeling. Like, okay, this suggestion makes sense. Um, I think good examples are again content creation. The question always comes up: I don't know how much I should pay someone to make a video. Um, but there's an intuition behind it, if I ask another video maker how to do it. But if you ask them to write down the rules, they won't be able to do it because it's just a feeling and instinct. So this is where we see a lot of opportunity, actually, in training an agent, but maybe not a classic LLM, but rather exactly what companies like Jeff's models are doing now, focusing on the outcome.

### 垂直AI的护城河：工作流与深度绑定

**Seema**: 首先是掌控我们反复强调的**端到端工作流闭环**，借此沉淀独有的专有数据资产，并具备完成过去任何人都无法实现之任务的能力。

关于**竞争护城河**（moats），过早精准预判一家企业未来的护城河是非常困难的。回看所有最成功的优秀公司，在早期阶段他们想的不是“我必须先走完这六步，到第七步我才会形成竞争壁垒”，而是纯粹地聚焦于“我如何赢得客户的深度信任，向他们提供更多价值，把核心工作真正做扎实”。

高壁垒与持久生命力的本质来自于客户的高度参与和深层依赖。传统 CRM 仅仅是一个登记所有销售交易的被动日记账本，而新一代 AI 销售 Agent 已经切身接管了客户拓展、商机研判、邮件往来等极为繁重复杂的实质性工作。当客户的日常业务运转对你的产品产生强依赖时，这才是构筑坚实护城河最强烈的信号。

至于所谓的获客飞轮、网络效应等等，全都是产品为客户带来切实不可替代的价值之后的自然结果。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seema**: First, it's ownership of the entire workflow that we're talking about, creating this data asset and being able to do things that in many cases no one has done before. Given this, I think we talk a lot about "moats" ( competitive advantages ). It is very, very difficult to predict your " moat" for the future. If you look at all the best companies, in the early stages they just thought, “Okay, I’m gaining customer trust, I’m selling to them more, and there’s a lot of opportunity here,” rather than “ Okay, I’ll do these six steps, then I’ll move on to step seven, and then we’ll have a competitive advantage .” So I think we talk a lot about security and durability, and part of that is customer engagement, more dependencies arise, they appreciate it, and you do most of the work. And here it really is: you know, the old CRM company was a log for all deals, the new AI sales agent actually takes over a significant part of the sales preparation process, outbound processes, processing incoming requests and doing a lot of work. Um, the company, the customer in general depends on this product, and this is a very important signal for creating a "moat" around the business. And everything we talk about in terms of customer acquisition, network effects, etc., is kind of a consequence of that initial customer usage and the value of the product.

</details>

**Elina**: Vlad，你在与客户或潜在买家交流时，是否有人挑战过你：“我们为什么要买你的产品？我们直接调用大模型 API 内部自研一套不行吗？或者直接用现有的记录系统加个模型插件不也可以吗？”面对这种质疑，你通常如何说服他们选择 Leo？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elina**: Um, Vlad, have you had any conversations with customers or potential customers who asked you, “Why should I buy your product?” “Why can’t I just plug into the model and do it myself?” Or use any existing accounting system I have, plus a model. What do you tell them and how do you convince them to use Leo?

</details>

### 70%与100%自动化之间的巨大鸿沟

**Vlad**: 这是百分之百会遇到的经典问题，而且是一个非常合情合理的疑问。

甚至从我们 Leo 自身的创业历程来看：三年前我们在采购界一炮走红的第一个核心用例，其实就是将发票报价数据抓取并自动录入 SAP 系统。从技术实现上讲并不复杂，但它给客户带来了巨大的商业价值。当时我们全公司就三四个人，搭建出来并成功卖给了客户。

而到了今天，这已经变成了我们给 Leo 应聘工程师出的一道常规面试作业题：我们要求面试者在 8 个小时内完整手搓出这样一个原型。三年前能让我们立足的拳头产品，如今一个工程师花 8 小时就能做出来，可见当前基础构建模块的成熟与便捷。

于是企业很自然会问：既然一个人 8 小时就能做出来，那我们采购技术团队花上两个月，难道做不出一整套系统吗？

答案是：你确实能在 8 小时或者几个月内做出一个展示型 Demo，但你最多只能达到 70% 的准确率或生产力。而在复杂的企业级业务场景中，**70% 的准确率绝不等于 70% 的自动化**。

如果系统的准确率只有 70%，意味着人类员工依然必须把 100% 的数据全量肉眼审核一遍，因为你不知道错误会在哪个致命环节发生。其最终结果是：你不仅没有实现减负，反而给员工凭空创造了更多复杂的审核排错工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Vlad**: Yes, one hundred percent, and that's a fair question, right? Even if you look at Leo from the inside, the first case three years ago that went kind of viral in the procurement world was simply about getting a price quote and entering that information into SAP. It was technically simple, but it brought enormous business value. So you have this information retrieval agent that collects all the data and feeds it into SAP. This was our first product. And we had a team of engineers, obviously small, just the three of us and maybe four people who built it and then sold it. But today it's a case of applying for a job at Leo. We invite people to create this, and they have about 8 hours to do it. So what I want to say is that a product that was one of our first use cases can now be built by engineers in 8 hours. Because it's so easy to create things now. So the logical question is: if someone can build this in 8 hours...Okay, cool, but couldn't the procurement departments just build the whole thing in 2 months? And the answer is: yes, you can build it in 8 hours, but you will only achieve, say, 70% productivity. And the problem is that 70% productivity or accuracy, or however you measure it—it depends on the task—doesn't mean 70% automation. So, this might mean that you have 70% productivity, but you still need to do 100% of the work, because 70% is not that much. So again, all people have to verify the data. So you might even have created more work than before.

</details>

**Seema**: 针对 Vlad 的观点，我想补充两点。

第一，通用大模型与 **ChatGPT** 普及度的激增对整个行业绝对是重大利好，因为随着大众对 AI 工具认知的提升和使用习惯的建立，客户对垂直高度专业化 AI 产品的心理接受度与信任门槛也显著降低了。

第二，两三周前我与一家财富 500 强企业的管理层深入沟通，他们透露过去几个月他们曾尝试在企业内部完全自主研发一套智能对账与现金流产品。在折腾了三四个月之后，他们痛苦地发现：内部数据的全局上下文极其匮乏且质量极其低下。他们收集了海量的会议录音和屏幕截图，试图把所有数据喂进一个自研系统，但输出效果差强人意。

更棘手的问题接踵而至：该企业内部运转着两套不同的 ERP 系统，而且正在计划收购兼并另一套新的财务软件，那么未来到底由谁来持续维护所有异构系统之间的字段映射？谁来保证端到端的流程运转？正如我们反复提到的业务异常处理，系统环境稍有变动就必须重新适配，他们迅速意识到在企业内部闭门造车是完全不切实际的。

历史总是惊人地相似，大企业过去就一再尝试自研各种内部 IT 系统，最终往往铩羽而归。企业正在重新意识到：明确自身核心主业边界至关重要，工具链的工程化沉淀应当交给更专业的第三方团队。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seema**: Two things worth adding to what Vlad said. First, it is generally good that basic models or GPT-type products are gaining more popularity, because it means that people will also trust highly specialized products. Therefore, I believe that increased awareness, comfort, and excitement about AI tools is generally good for the market. The second thing: I was talking to a management team at a Fortune 500 company two or three weeks ago, and they mentioned that they were trying to build their own cash-raising product as a large corporate business. And after, I don't know, at least three or four months of work, they discovered that there wasn't enough context; the context was of low quality. They had a lot of recordings, a lot of screenshots. They tried to put it all together into one system, but the results weren't good enough. And then a huge question arose: we now have two different ERP systems and we were going to buy another one, so who is going to update all the mappings and check if everything is working? And we keep talking about exception handling, you now have to map that to a completely different system, a different way of doing things, and I think they quickly realized that in-house development didn't make sense. So we hear stories like this all the time where people say, "Okay, I'll do the development in-house, " and then, " Wait, this is no different than what corporations have always tried to do on their own in the past." But, um, I think corporations in general are realizing that there's their core competency, and then there's the development of internal tools, and they should focus on the former.

</details>

### 企业自研的陷阱与核心能力边界

**Vlad**: 完全切中要害。外部团队搭建原型或许能轻松摸到 80%，但**决定产品能否在生产环境中跑通的，恰恰是最后那至关重要的 20%**。

那最后的 20% 需要强大的系统底座支撑：深度且稳定的异构系统集成、多层记忆机制、工业级工作流编排以及深厚的垂直行业专有数据。正如**帕累托法则**（Pareto principle）所揭示的，这最后的 20% 往往需要耗费 80% 的极致工程努力。

因此对于那些财富 500 强企业而言，自研并非完全不可行，但前提是你们必须做好心理准备：将企业级采购系统与自主 Agent 的研发上升为整家公司的核心竞争力之一。如果这不是你们的战略核心，那就必须慎重衡量自研的巨大沉没成本。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Vlad**: Yes. Yes, that makes sense. Ahem. Yes. That's exactly what I meant: Sure, they can reach 80%, but that last 20% really matters. Um, and they matter in order to go into production. That's why you need this base, right? You need all these integrations, memory, workflows, and sometimes industry data. Um, to do that. And, as the Pareto principle says, those 20% can require 80% of the effort. Um, or they take 80% of the effort. Um, so to all those Fortune 500 companies: you can do it. But then, say, procurement processes or AI procurement agents should become one of your core competencies. And you should evaluate whether it makes sense for you to make this one of your key skills.

</details>

**Elina**: Vlad，我很好奇你们是否观察到供应商端也开始使用 Agent 或 AI 了？当买卖双方都全副武装配备了 AI 时，未来的商业图景会是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elina**: Vlad, I'm curious if you see suppliers starting to use agents or AI, and what do you think will happen when both buyers and suppliers are fully equipped with AI?

</details>

**Vlad**: 我们百分之百坚信，未来交易的买卖双边都会部署属于自己的 AI Agent。

但有趣的是：历史上在企业软件领域，销售端的技术成熟度与投入向来远远领先于采购端；然而当我们审视那些财富 500 强制造巨头的上游供应商群体时，却发现情况悄然发生了反转。这些供应商可能会用 AI 录录音或者用 **Granola** 这类会议纪要工具，但在实际工作流的自动化 Agent 方面却相对滞后。

采购历来被视为一个“不性感”的苦力工种，销售是前台风光的印钞机，采购则是后台繁琐的节流者。但在当今的高端工业制造巨头中，强势采购方对其供应商具有极强的规则话语权：大型汽车主机厂可以直接规定上游供应商必须遵循怎样的工艺规范、达到怎样的良品率、以怎样的标准格式响应询价 RFQ。

因此当我们在买方采购端牢固占据核心节点后，大买家完全可以推动供应商也接入并采用这套协同 Agent 体系，从而形成涵盖买卖双边的交易自动化闭环。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Vlad**: Mhm. Yes. We are 100% sure that in the future there will be agents on both sides. Um, and that's quite logical. But, strangely enough, we see that when we look at the supplier side, it's essentially the seller side, right? We see that the seller side has always been ahead of the purchasing side. But now , as we look at the suppliers of these Fortune 500 companies, we see that this is no longer the case. They may have advanced, say, in video recording or using tools like Granola, but they don't have agents that automate the work. And the cool thing about shopping is that it's "unsexy," right? Sales is attractive, procurement is not, but this is the only process where procurement is the opposing party. But now the good thing is that in these industrial companies, Fortune 500 companies, procurement has more power over the supplier. Because you, as a typical example, for example, an automotive component supplier, dictate to your suppliers what they should use, what the quality should be, how they should respond to a specific request for quotation (RFQ). So now there is an opportunity if we serve the purchasing department, they can dictate what the supplier should use. Why don't we also promote agents to them that help automate the work, covering both sides of the transaction?

</details>

### 交易双边Agent化与无摩擦协同

**Seema**: Elina，我们今天早些时候还在探讨：同一套技术平台如何同时服务利益存在博弈冲突的交易双边？

这其实完全可以类比于法律服务行业：即便代表不同利益立场的两家律所处于激烈的对抗博弈中，双方依然存在巨大的共同利益基础——比如实时同步案件最新进展、厘清未决的核心争议清单、确认双方已达成共识的条款事实。过去这全部依靠大量律师的人工机械沟通，未来这些中立的协同对齐工作完全可以由 Agent 自动完成。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seema**: Olena, I know we talked earlier today about how you can have two sides on one platform? How does it even work? I think this could even extend to legal work, right? Even if these are two very conflicting sides , right? But if you have two law firms with clients who have different interests, but both benefit from knowing: here's the latest project, here's where we are with open issues, here are the things that were agreed upon, and just keep track of that. This doesn't really exist now, right? This is all created by people, and this coordination work could be done by an agent.

</details>

**Elina**: 思考双边技术能力同步演进的图景非常奇妙。正如 Vlad 所说，或许有一方跑得稍快一些，但假以时日，双方终将在同一平台上达成更加顺畅的跨组织协作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elina**: Yes. Yes. It's great to think about how both sides are perhaps developing in parallel. One side may move a little faster, as you said, Vlad, but over time, maybe people will just be on the same platform, and it will be much better coordinated for everyone.

</details>

**Vlad**: 确实如此。显而易见的疑问是：如果谈判双边都派出专属 Agent，这难道不会变成针尖对麦芒的零和博弈吗？

在纯粹的最终成交价格上，双方确实存在利益博弈；但正如我们前面分析的，**最终的价格只是前期 5,000 项细分前置工作共同交织出的一个结算结果**。而在那 5,000 项具体任务中，买卖双方的利益诉求是完全高度一致的：

销售端渴望消除一切不必要的交易摩擦以快速促成回款；采购端则渴望零部件尽早入库以确保产线准时开工。重回我们造飞机或建数据中心的案例：双方都希望数据中心以最快速度落成投产，绝不希望因为供应商报价解析迟缓而让整个项目延误半年。

在这 5,000 项非零和的协同任务中，买卖双方的目标高度同频。因此 Leo 可以同时在交易两端部署 Agent，自动化处理所有这些阻碍效率的繁杂协作。这就是这套架构的精妙之处。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Vlad**: 100%, because, as we mentioned at the beginning, right? So the obvious question is: Okay, we also talked a little bit about negotiation agents. What if both sides had negotiating agents? And the price is 100% the moment where it's a zero-sum game or where they have different interests. But we also discussed that the price is the result of 5,000 other tasks that have taken place. And for these 5,000 other tasks, they have the same incentives. Sales wants to have as little friction as possible. Buyers want to get to market quickly, right? Again , going back to building airplanes, building data centers. You want this data center built as quickly as possible. You don't want it to be built 6 months late just because it takes so long to analyze all the responses from suppliers. Um, and you want to speed up sales as well. So, just like for all those 500 or 5,000 other tasks , the incentive is exactly the same. And so you can deploy, or Leo can deploy agents on both sides, automating all these other tasks. Hmm, that's the beauty of it.

</details>

### 现场实施的工程化与自我自动化

**Elina**: 过去软件行业往往恪守一条铁律：尽量避免为个别大客户过度做深度定制开发。但伴随着大语言模型和 AI 的演进，定制化交付似乎变得轻盈许多，不再会严重拖慢软件公司的整体扩张步伐。你们在实战中是否有类似的体会？这对终端企业软件买家又意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elina**: I think there used to be a logic that you shouldn't tailor software too much to one end user or client. But I think that with big language models and AI in general , it might become easier to customize a product without slowing down your business. So I'm wondering if you observe anything similar, Vlad or Simo? And what does this actually mean for end software buyers?

</details>

**Seema**: 当前行业在客户一线驻场实施部署方面投入了极其繁重的精力。部分原因在于每个客户内部的数据资产与业务上下文差异极大，理解客户 N 与理解客户 N+1 完全是两码事，行业目前仍处于早期的爬坡探索阶段。

现有传统巨头很难跑通这种敏捷模式，因为巨头的组织架构根本不是为这种敏捷**反馈闭环**设计的；他们虽然拥有庞大的驻场实施团队，但实施在内部被视作辅助性的交付成本中心，而不是反哺底层核心产品进化的核心飞轮。

而现代 AI 软件的精髓在于**学习反馈飞轮**（learning cycles）：只要搭建起科学严谨的评估机制，系统就能逐步驾驭越来越高维复杂的业务任务，甚至连落地部署与配置本身也能逐步实现自动化。

我很想了解 Vlad 他们是如何落地的。我们投资组合中的许多优秀公司都在以极快的速度实现交付：一方面大量定制化适配由 AI 自动推导完成；另一方面客户可以通过直观的软件界面自行配置业务逻辑。这彻底颠覆了过去动辄聘请埃森哲耗时数年定制 SAP 的笨重外包时代，实施团队的角色更偏向于顶层系统架构顾问，一切的核心驱动力完全收敛于软件本身。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seema**: I think, overall, a lot of work is currently being done to implement solutions on the ground. Part of this is because the state of customer data and understanding customer N is much more complex than understanding N plus 1. So we're in the early stages of implementation, and that's why there are still a lot of people involved in this product. Incidentally, this is harder for market leaders to implement because they are not set up for such a feedback loop ; they have implementation teams , but it's more of a secondary process, not something that fuels product development. The beauty of AI is that it learns over time —what we call learning cycles—and if you have the right evaluation process in place, you can do increasingly complex tasks, and part of that is automating the deployment itself. So you can.. and I'd be interested to hear how Vlad does it, but a lot of our companies are doing it pretty quickly, where customization: (A) is handled automatically, and (B) the customer can configure the parameters themselves through the software, unlike how it used to be when you brought in Accenture to customize SAP, and now you have an implementation team that helps with the architecture, but ultimately everything is driven by software.

</details>

**Vlad**: 这正是为什么在 Leo 的团队组织架构中，**工程师的比例高达约 85%**。即便是不担任纯技术岗位的成员，也绝大多数具备扎实的工程技术背景。我们骨子里绝不希望演变成一家出卖工时的 IT 咨询服务公司。

面对大型企业错综复杂的个性化流程，确实需要大量一线驻场部署工作。但我们践行的工程信条是：在产品顶层设计上持续降低定制化门槛，提供极高维度的开箱即用自助服务。

我们的一线部署工程师（**FDE**）的核心考核指标是：**你的终极工作目标，就是用软件代码彻底自动化你自己的工作**。当你在实施现场发现某种个性化流程重复出现了多次，你的任务就是把这套逻辑自动化打包进产品核心能力中；当你成功把自己在这个环节的工作彻底自动化之后，你再转身去攻坚下一个新挑战。

这与早期 **Google** 工程师用软件代码代替自身重复运维工作的工程哲学如出一辙。我们打造产品与拓展客户正是坚守这一纯粹的软件化原则。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Vlad**: Yes. Well, that's the reason why, when you look at the organizational structure of Leo, about 85% of the people are engineers. And even if you look at those who don't have an engineering position, they mostly have an engineering background , and the reason is that we obviously don't want to be a consulting company, right? So we make sure we have the best agents in indirect, direct procurement and finance, and in those areas. But then, as you mentioned, there's a lot of on-site deployment work if you're working with large companies, because they have different nuances in their processes. But we work as you mentioned: we build the product in a way that reduces the need for customization, and also provides a high level of self-service. So the work of our FDEs and implementation engineers is , on the one hand, to create opportunities for self-service, and on the other hand, to automate our own work. So their KPI is for you to see this happen many times. Your job is literally to automate yourself. And then, once you've automated yourself, you move on to the next task. I think this is the same approach that Google used. So, yes, I agree with you 100%. And that's exactly what we build and how we do it.

</details>

### 采购痛点、情绪价值与万亿机遇

**Elina**: 最近企业记录系统领域发生了一件盛事，我指的不是 Dreamforce 大会，而是 Leo 在纽约举办的“**机器人与采购者峰会**”（Bots and Buyers Summit）。

我很想听听来自一线现场的生动故事：你在企业买家群体中观察到了怎样的情绪？大家对什么充满狂热？对未来有哪些深切期待？他们向你提出了哪些诉求？能否跟我们分享一下当天的精彩花絮？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elina**: There was a very big event recently related to accounting systems, and we're not talking about Dreamforce. We're talking about the Bots and Buyers summit that Leo hosted in New York. I would like to hear real stories from the scene and find out what you see among buyers. What are people passionate about? What do people expect in the future? What do people ask you for? Can you tell us any stories from that day and that event?

</details>

**Vlad**: 这是我们第三次举办这一峰会，地点就在距离我们纽约办公室几个街区的地方，现场汇聚了超过 100 位顶级采购领袖——全都是各大企业的资深采购总监、副总裁等决策者。

现场之所以引起如此强烈的共鸣，核心在于两点：

第一，过去 27 年来企业采购工具的运转机制令人窒息。你在 LinkedIn 上可以看到各种所谓的采购科技全景图，上面罗列了至少 500 款各类单点采购软件。但如果你去问任何一个真正负责采购业务的人，采购是一个极其痛苦的话题。

我敢向任何人发起挑战：你在现实中根本找不到哪怕一个发自内心热爱与传统采购流程打交道的人！无论是提出采购需求的内部业务部门、外部供应商、还是采购团队员工自己，全都在痛苦中煎熬。市面上哪怕冒出 1,000 款工具，也仅仅是将表单流转效率稍微提升了一点点，从未从根本上改变过这群人每天真正的作业方式——直到今天，他们每天最核心的生产工具依然是原始的 Outlook 邮件、微软 Teams、Excel 表格和 PPT，这些核心工作流中根本没有 AI 的影子。

第二，我们向他们展现了跨职能、端到端的全景采购新范式。我们不是在兜售“看，我们做了一个酷炫的某某发票处理小插件”，而是完整贯穿了从某人萌生需求、到合同签署、间接与直接物料采购、跨国物流、财务清算直至最终交付的全流程闭环。

我们甚至把 AI Agent 具象化地引入到了物理现实中：因为大模型 Agent 往往抽象模糊，我们在纽约办公室里搭建了实体的实体体验展位，与会高管可以亲手触摸、测试并指令这些 Agent 协同处理复杂的真实任务。现场的反响极其热烈，下一届峰会预计将突破 700 人规模，整个买方圈子彻底沸腾了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Vlad**: Well, this was the third time we held this event. We held it in New York, just a few blocks from our office, and over 100 procurement leaders came. And we made sure that when we hold such events, we only invite high-class professionals, right? So, senior managers , purchasing directors, vice presidents. And there are two things that are very different, or why they are so impressed. The first thing is how procurement has worked over the last 26-27 years, because there have been a lot of tools, right? You can see all of these technology landscapes on LinkedIn. You will see about 500 procurement tools there. But if you talk to procurement people, it's a very painful topic. I challenge anyone to find someone who loves working with procurement. There simply are none. It's safe to say that people hate working with procurement. I'm talking about those who make requests, about suppliers, and even the people in procurement themselves hate working with this department. So what happens if there are 1000 tools? And the reason is that all these tools.. They just made the process a little more efficient. That's all. But they never changed how these people actually work. It's just crazy that they still work in email , Microsoft Teams, Excel spreadsheets, and PowerPoint. This is their main channel of work, where there is no artificial intelligence. Of course. And this is the same part. And the other thing is we give them a very broad interagency view of procurement. Right? We don't say, "Look at this cool billing feature we built." We look at how someone needs something, and at the end of the day it ends up on your desk—it could cover indirect costs, direct costs, logistics, finance, and you see how we do it. We also bring this into the physical world, because AI agents—that's very abstract. That's why we create stands, they even exist in our offices, particularly in New York, where you can walk around and try out all these agents in practice. And that's exactly what people like, the next event will be for about 700 people. So you can imagine how massive it is.

</details>

**Elina**: 买家们简直为之疯狂。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elina**: Buyers went on a rampage. Yes.

</details>

**Vlad**: 没错，下一次盛会将移师欧洲的慕尼黑举行。我们一直持续在纽约和慕尼黑等全球枢纽轮流举办此类大会。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Vlad**: Yes, it will happen , and that event will be held in Munich. Yes. So, we hold them, for example, in Europe, Munich and New York all the time.

</details>

**Elina**: 听众朋友们如果身处采购行业，应该知道该往何处寻找答案了。我最后还有一个问题想请教二位：究竟需要具备怎样的质变，才能让人们真正对采购这门业务感到兴奋？是 Agent？是团队？是时间节约？还是其他什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Elina**: Yes. Well, if you're listening to us and you're in the procurement business, you know where to turn. Maybe I have one question, one question from me. What do you think it takes to get people excited about shopping? Are these agents? Are these people? Is this a time saver? Or something else?

</details>

**Seema**: 正如你所言，采购在历史上是公认客户满意度垫底的领域之一。

我记得大约七八年前我调研企业采购软件赛道时，曾访谈过一位资深采购负责人。他劈头盖脸地对我说：“我甚至连聊都不想聊这个产品！我被迫用着陈旧过时的记录系统，我们用的是 **Coupa**，我什么新软件都不想买，也根本不想讨论这个话题。”这是我打过的上百万个调研电话中，怨气最重、最不满意的客户。我很想听听 Vlad 的见解，究竟是什么能够彻底扭转人们对这个赛道的刻板印象并激发起狂热的激情？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Seema**: You mentioned this. Procurement is one of those things that I remember people not liking, it's an area with universally low customer satisfaction. I remember talking to a guy in procurement probably 7 or 8 years ago when I was studying this category. And he said, "I hate talking about this product." I use, you know, this outdated accounting system. I'm on Coupa and don't want to buy anything else. I don't want to talk about it. This is normal. This was the most dissatisfied customer I have ever spoken to out of millions of similar calls. But I'm curious what you think really makes people excited about this category.

</details>

**Vlad**: 这恰恰是我深深热爱采购赛道的核心原因：重要的不是过去发生了什么，而是人们对此产生的情绪共鸣是如此强烈。

通常大家总觉得 B2B 企业软件是冷冰冰的，但采购领域却饱含着极度充沛的情感与宣泄。只要你和从业者交谈，每个人都满腹牢骚、苦不堪言——这意味着用户痛点无比强烈，拥有巨大的情绪张力。

当你把这种“看似枯燥但蕴含深重情绪”的高度垂直领域与革命性技术结合时，初创企业反而拥有巨大的破局优势：因为他们上一场真正经历的技术革命已经是 20 年前了，十年前充其量只是界面做了一点 UI 美化，其余一切毫无长进。在这片久旱的大地上，给用户带来颠覆性体验其实更容易。

最关键的是，采购对企业底层商业盈利拥有极其震撼的杠杆撬动效应。

表面上它似乎不起眼，但正如我前面阐述的，制造汽车、飞机、无人机和数据中心，全都离不开精准有力的采购体系。更重要的是，在严酷的市场竞争环境中，**为了让企业的净利润率提升 1%，通常要求销售部门在前端拼死多创造 10% 的营收额；反之，如果你能在采购端削减下哪怕 1% 的纯支出，就能直接等效于多做了 10% 的销售额对利润表的同等贡献**。

当这三者完美交汇——极度枯燥但饱含情绪痛点、二十年未曾变革的荒原、以及对企业利润表拥有十倍杠杆撬动力的巨大商业价值，你所面对的，毫无疑问是一个**价值数万亿美元的超级历史机遇**。

不仅仅是采购，所有具备这三项特质的实体经济领域，都正在迎来前所未有的重塑。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Vlad**: Yes. So, I mean, that's the reason I love procurement, it's not so much what happened, but how people react to it. Isn't that right ? If you talk to people, they are very irritated. So, this is a very emotional topic. But let's be honest, B2B—that's us, okay? But it's very emotional. So that's good. And if you combine that with something boring and highly specialized , that's also an advantage, because it's easier for us to impress these people, right? Because the last real revolution they saw was 20 years ago. Well, and maybe a better user interface 10 years ago. But nothing more happened. And so you have a boring but highly emotional field, plus a crazy impact on business. Yes? It seems unnecessary, but as I have already given examples. This obviously has a huge impact on profits and losses, and also affects the entire economy. Isn't that right? So, we're talking about how data centers are built , how airplanes are built , how cars are built, uh, how drones are built. So it's extremely important to, uh, have a fixed procurement process, uh , not just to implement or build something. Uh, but also when you talk about when we, when you look at the competitive environment. So to get a 1% margin increase, uh, you need to make 10 % more revenue, 10% more sales. Uh, so if you can get even 1% savings, that's 10% of the sales, uh, that you have to make, uh, to get the same result on your income statement. Uh , so this is extremely important. And if you combine all three of those things, you get, uh, a trillion-dollar business opportunity. This, this is my opinion. How about procurement, but there are probably other things that are emotional, boring, but have a huge impact on the business.
