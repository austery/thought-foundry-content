### 职业生涯的转折与精神世界的探索

中文翻译:
我最初是一名儿科实习医生，在那里我见过一例又一例的耳部感染。孩子们很可爱，但耳部感染几乎都大同小异。然而，当你与人们谈论他们的生活时，却永远不会有相同的经历。我知道这会让我终生保持兴趣，事实也确实如此。我出乎意料地对**精神病学**（Psychiatry）产生了兴趣。我从小到大从未认识过精神科医生。但在医学院时，我发现人们思维运作的方式是我可能研究的最迷人的事物。因此，我最终发现，在医学领域，除了精神病学，我别无所求。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
I started out as an intern in pediatrics
and I would see one ear
infection after another,
and the kids were adorable,
but one ear infection
is pretty much the same as every other.
Whereas when you talk to
people about their lives,
it's never the same.
And I knew that that
would keep me interested
for my whole career, which it has.
I became interested in
psychiatry unexpectedly.
I had never known a
psychiatrist growing up.
But when I was in medical school,
I found that the way people's minds worked
was the most fascinating
thing I could possibly study.
So I eventually found that
there was really nothing else
for me in medicine, but doing psychiatry.

### 哈佛成人发展研究的起源

中文翻译:
我是**哈佛成人发展研究**（Harvard Study of Adult Development）的第四任主任，这是有史以来最长寿的成人生活研究。我们已经进行了85年。它始于1938年，最初是两个互不知情的独立研究。一项研究在**哈佛大学健康服务中心**（Harvard Student Health Service）启动，对象是19岁的二年级本科生，他们的院长认为他们是优秀、正直的年轻人。另一项研究则关注青少年犯罪，对象是来自波士顿最贫困家庭、年龄从中学的男孩，这些家庭也往往是最困苦的，饱受家庭暴力、父母精神疾病和身体疾病等问题的困扰。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
I am the fourth director
of the Harvard Study of Adult Development,
and it is the longest study of adult life
that's ever been done.
We're in our 85th year.
It started in 1938
as two studies that weren't
even aware of each other.
One study started at Harvard
Student Health Service
with 19-year-old sophomores
who were thought by
their deans to be fine,
upstanding young men.
And the other study was a
study of juvenile delinquency
and it selected boys middle school age
from Boston's poorest families,
but also the most troubled families,
families beset by problems
like domestic violence
and parental mental illness
and physical illness.
</details>

### 研究的独特视角与设计

中文翻译:
这项研究旨在了解什么因素能让人们在成长和发展过程中茁壮成长。这一点很不寻常，因为大多数已完成的研究都关注人类发展中出现的问题，以便我们能提供帮助。但这项研究关注的是**什么让人们做得好**（what goes right），即来自弱势家庭的孩子如何保持积极的人生轨迹并健康成长？当然，那些非常幸运的哈佛学生群体则被视为研究正常成年早期发展的对象。我们现在知道，如果要研究正常的成年早期发展，不能只研究来自哈佛的白人男性，但在当时，他们确实是这么做的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
This study set out to understand
what makes people thrive
as they grow and develop.
And that was unusual
because most research that's been done
is done on what goes
wrong in human development
so that we can help people.
But this was a study of what goes right,
so it was how do kids from
disadvantaged families
stay on good paths and develop well?
And then, of course, the
very privileged Harvard group
was meant to be a study of
normal young adult development.
We now know that if you wanna study
normal young adult development,
you don't just study
white men from Harvard,
but at that time, that's what they did.

### 幸福与健康的核心问题

中文翻译:
我们研究人们一生的**幸福感**（wellbeing）。我们的核心问题是：如果你今天能做出一个选择，让你一生都保持快乐和健康，你会选择什么？大多数人认为这与致富或取得巨大成就有关，有些人甚至认为他们需要成名才能拥有幸福健康的生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
We study wellbeing as
people go through life,
and our big question is,
if you could make one choice today
to make it likely that
you would stay happy
and stay healthy throughout your life,
what single choice would you make?
And most of us think it's
something to do with getting rich
or achieving a lot,
and some people even think
they need to become famous
to have a happy, healthy life.
</details>

### 人际关系是幸福的关键

中文翻译:
但我们的研究以及许多其他研究表明，最有可能让我们保持幸福健康生活轨迹的单一选择，是**投资于我们与他人的关系**。我们研究中那些拥有最快乐、最温暖人际关系的人，也是最长寿、最健康的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
But our study and many other studies show
that the single choice we can make
that's most likely to keep us
on a good path of wellbeing
is to invest in our
relationships with other people.
The people in our study
who had the happiest,
warmest relationships
were the people who stayed healthy longest
and who lived the longest.
</details>

### 研究方法：纵向追踪与参与者扩展

中文翻译:
哈佛研究始于1938年，一直追踪同一批人，贯穿他们的一生，从青少年时期直至老年。研究最初纳入了724名年轻男性，随后我们又邀请了他们的大部分妻子，以及最终他们的大部分子女。因此，现在有超过2000人在这724个家庭中，我们追踪了他们整个成年生活。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
The Harvard study started in 1938,
and it has followed the same people
throughout their entire lives,
from the time they were teenagers
all the way into old age.
The study began with 724 young men,
and then we brought in most of their wives
and eventually most of their children,
so that now there are over 2,000 people
in these 724 families who we have followed
through their entire adult lives.
</details>

### 研究方法：早期数据收集

中文翻译:
我们开始收集信息的方式是，为这些年轻男性提供详尽的心理和医学检查。然后我们拜访他们的家，与他们的父母，有时甚至是祖父母交谈，研究人员会详细记录晚餐内容、家庭的管教方式，甚至窗帘的样式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
We started collecting information
by giving these young men
elaborate psychological examinations,
also medical examinations.
Then we went to their homes,
we talked to their parents,
and sometimes even their grandparents,
and the workers made elaborate notes
about what was being served for dinner
and what the discipline
style was in the family
and even what the curtains looked like.
</details>

### 研究方法：方法演变与整合

中文翻译:
随着研究人类生活的新方法不断涌现，我们也采纳了这些方法。例如，录音、录像，现在我们还抽取血液进行**DNA**（Deoxyribonucleic Acid: 脱氧核糖核酸）检测，而DNA在1938年研究开始时甚至还未被设想出来。我们让许多研究对象进入**MRI**（Magnetic Resonance Imaging: 磁共振成像）扫描仪，观察他们在观看不同图像时大脑的活动情况。我们把他们带到实验室，故意让他们承受压力，然后观察他们如何从压力中恢复，以此作为理解幸福感的另一种方式。现在很普遍但我们刚开始时很不寻常的一点是，结合了生物学测量和心理学测量，观察我们的生理状况如何受到精神状态的影响，反之亦然。因此，这种**身心测量**（mind and body measurement）的结合在过去20年里相对较新。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
And then eventually,
as new methods of studying
human life came on board,
we adopted those methods.
So audio taping, videotaping,
we now draw blood for DNA,
and DNA wasn't even imagined
in 1938 when the study began.
We've put many of our
people into an MRI scanner
and watched how their brains light up
as we show them different visual images.
We bring them into our laboratory
and we deliberately stress them out,
and then we watch how
they recover from stress
as one more way of
understanding wellbeing.
One of the things that is more common now,
but was unusual when we started it
was combining biological measures
and psychological measures
and seeing how our biology is influenced
by our mental states and vice versa.
So it's this combining of
mind and body measurement
that was relatively new
in the last 20 years.
</details>

### 幸福科学：可控因素分析

中文翻译:
接着就出现一个问题：我们的幸福感有多少是可控的？科学家们对此进行了一些科学分析。心理学家**索尼娅·柳博米尔斯基**（Sonja Lyubomirsky）的一项分析估计，大约50%的幸福感是一种**生物设定点**（biological set point），可能由基因决定，这与天生的气质有关。我们都知道有些人天生就比较忧郁，而有些人则无论发生什么都显得很开朗。所以，大约一半的幸福感来自这种天生的气质。她发现，约10%的幸福感基于我们当前的生活环境。而最后40%则在我们自己手中。我们可以**改变现状**（move the needle）。通过构建包含幸福条件的生命，我们可以让自己更有可能获得幸福。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
The question comes up,
how much of our happiness
is under our control?
And they've actually done some
scientific analysis of this.
A psychologist named Sonja Lyubomirsky
did an analysis in which she estimates
that about 50% of our happiness
is a kind of biological set point,
probably determined by our genes.
That has to do with inborn temperament.
We all know people who are
kind of naturally gloomy
and other people who are naturally chipper
no matter what's going on.
So about half of our happiness
is that inborn temperament.
And then about 10% she finds
is based on our current
life circumstances.
And then the last 40%
is under our control.
We can move the needle.
We can make ourselves
more likely to be happy
by building a life that
includes the conditions
that make for happiness.
</details>

### 人际关系的评估维度

中文翻译:
关于我们的人际关系，我们可以问自己一些简单的问题。第一，我的生活中是否有足够的联结？或者是否联结过多？如果我是一个比较害羞的人，不需要太多人陪伴，那么我是否拥有我所需的那种联结？每个人都可以审视自己。然后，问题是：我拥有温暖和支持性的关系吗？同样，我们每个人都需要问自己这个问题：我身边有没有支持我的人，我感觉在紧急情况下可以打电话给他们，他们会来帮助我？因为艰难的时刻总会到来。然后还有一个问题是，我从人际关系中获得了什么？我是否有足够的人可以一起玩乐？我是否有足够的人在我需要修理房子时借我工具，或者在我需要搭车时开车送我去医院？我是否有这样的朋友？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
The questions that we might ask ourselves
about our relationships
are kind of simple.
One is, do I have enough
connection in my life
or do I even have too much connection?
If I'm a shyer person
and don't need as many people in my life,
so do I have what I need?
And each person can check in
with themselves about that.
Then the question is,
do I have relationships that
are warm and supportive?
And there again, each of us
needs to ask that question,
do I have people who have my back,
who I feel I could call
and would be there in an emergency?
Because hard times are
always coming our way.
And then the question is also,
what am I getting from relationships?
Do I have enough people to have fun with?
Do I have enough people who
will loan me their tools
when I need to fix something in my house,
or who will drive me to the
doctor when I need a ride?
Do I have those kinds of friends?
</details>

### 分享忧虑与情感支持的力量

中文翻译:
我们知道生活中总会有烦恼。我们都会遇到各种担忧，比如担心孩子、健康或财务。在我接受精神科医生培训时，我从一位导师那里学到了最好的教诲之一，他说：“**永远不要独自担忧**”（Never worry alone）。这位导师当时指的是担心我正在治疗的病人。但我逐渐明白，这几乎适用于生活中的一切：如果我真的担心某件事，并与我信任的人分享，这会极大地改变我感觉有多好，以及我有多么不感到孤单。我们从人际关系中获得的东西太多了，所以我们每个人都可以审视自己拥有什么，以及希望多得到一些什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
One of the things we know about life
is that we all have worries.
We all have concerns that come along,
worries about children,
worries about health,
worries about finances.
And one of the best teachings I got
in my training as a psychiatrist
was from one of my mentors
who said, "Never worry alone."
And this teacher meant that about
being worried about a
patient who I was treating.
But what I've come to understand
that it's really good advice
for just about everything in life,
that if I'm really worried about something
and I share it with somebody I trust,
it makes all the difference
in how much better I feel
and how much less alone
I feel with my worry.
There are so many different things
we get from relationships,
and so each of us can
check in with ourselves
about what we have and what we
would like a little more of.
</details>

### 童年经历与成年修正

中文翻译:
因此，我们学到了关于人际关系、关于良好关系的几个重要教训。其中之一是，**童年经历确实很重要**。童年时期的经历为我们如何看待世界设定了基调，如果我们由温暖、关爱且可靠的人抚养长大，这通常是件好事。有些人运气不好，在成长环境中觉得那些本应照顾他们的人不可信赖、靠不住。因此，许多这样的人成年后会认为世界不是一个安全的地方，人们不可靠。我们学到的另一件事是，成年后的经历可以纠正人们在童年时期学到的一些不幸教训。与一位好伴侣、可以依靠的好朋友建立联系，可以极大地改变我们对世界和人际关系的悲观看法，让我们认识到，是的，我们可以在人际关系的世界中找到良好、可靠的伙伴。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
So we've learned several big
lessons about relationships,
about good relationships,
and one of them is that
childhood experience
really does matter.
What happens to us in
childhood sets the stage
for what we come to expect from the world,
and that's often a good thing
if we're raised by people
who are warm and caring and reliable.
Some people don't have that luck
and are raised in environments
where they feel like the
people who are supposed
to take care of aren't
trustworthy, can't be relied upon.
And so many of those
people come into adulthood
with the expectation that
the world is not a safe place
and that people can't be relied on.
The other thing we've learned
is that adult experience
can correct for some of
those unfortunate lessons
that people learn in childhood.
Becoming connected with a good partner,
with good friends who you can count on
can go a long way to change
those gloomy expectations
about the world and about relationships,
and allow us to realize that yes,
we can find people who are good,
reliable partners in our relational world.
</details>

### 关系中的冲突与成长

中文翻译:
所以，我们学到的另一个教训是，所有重要的人际关系都会伴随一些分歧或困难。事实上，**面对这些困难往往能大大加强关系**，如果我们能够努力经营关系，这将在保持我们联系的牢固性方面带来丰厚的回报。这意味着，有分歧、有困难是正常的，而我们越能发展出解决困难的技能，我们的社交世界就会越好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
So another lesson that we learn is that
all relationships that are
important have some disagreements
or some difficulties.
And that actually,
facing those difficulties
goes a long way to strengthen
relationships much of the time
so that if we can work on relationships,
that turns out to have great payoff
in terms of keeping our
connections stronger.
What that means is that it's
normal to have disagreements,
it's normal to have difficulties,
and that the more skill we can develop
in working through difficulties,
the better our social worlds are.
</details>

### 联结是抵御艰难的保护伞

中文翻译:
我们研究中最大的一个发现是，**与他人的联结帮助我们度过人生的艰难时刻**，而艰难时刻在每个人的生命中都存在。我们的原始参与者出生于大萧条时期，许多哈佛本科生正值参战二战的年纪。当我们问他们，是如何度过这些极其困难的时期时，他们无一例外地谈到了自己的人际关系。在大萧条时期，邻居们分享了我们仅有的一点点食物。在战壕里，是我的战友们支撑着我前进。我在海外作战时，来自家乡的信件支撑着我。因此，我们发现，这些联结是抵御那些总会到来的艰难时刻的最佳保护。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
One of the biggest lessons
we learned from our study
is that our connections with other people
help us weather the hard times of life
and hard times are there in every life.
So our original participants
were born during the Great Depression
and many of the Harvard
undergraduates were of an age
to go and serve in World War II.
And when we asked them,
how did you get through
these really difficult times?
All of them to a person talked
about their relationships.
Our neighbors shared what little we had
during the depression.
My fellow soldiers in the trenches
were the people who kept me going.
The letters that came to me from back home
while I was overseas in the
war were what sustained me.
And so what we find is
that these connections
turn out to be the best protection
against the difficult times
that are always coming our way.
</details>

### 人类作为社会性动物的演化

中文翻译:
我们非常确定，人类进化成了**社会性动物**（social animals）。事实上，群体生活使我们更有可能在世界危险中生存下来并繁衍后代，这是进化的目标。因此，我们进化出在群体中感到安全和稳定的倾向，并将独处视为一种压力源。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
We are pretty sure that we human beings
evolved to be social animals,
that in fact, staying together in groups
made it more likely that we
would survive the dangers
that are out there in the world
and pass on our genes, which
is the goal of evolution.
So we evolved to find being together
secure and safe and to find
being alone a stressor.
</details>

### 孤独的压力源效应

中文翻译:
我们发现情况依然如此，那些比自己期望的更孤立的人会感到压力。**孤独**（Loneliness）是一个巨大的压力源，我们认为这既有生物学基础，也有情感基础。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
And what we find is that
that is still the case,
that people who are more isolated
than they want to be are stressed.
Loneliness is a big stressor,
and we think that that
is biologically based
as well as emotionally based.
</details>

### 压力调节与身心健康

中文翻译:
关于人际关系如何影响我们的身体健康，最好的假说是通过压力。我们几乎整天都会经历压力事件，这是正常的。当我们感到压力时，身体会进入所谓的**“战或逃”模式**（fight or flight mode），心率会升高，可能开始出汗，发生一系列变化。但当压力源消失后，身体会恢复到平衡状态。我们认为，如果白天发生了压力事件，而我能回家与朋友交谈或打电话给某人，我能真切地感受到身体平静下来。如果我生活中发生压力事件却无处倾诉，我们相信身体会持续处于一种低水平的慢性“战或逃”模式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
The best hypothesis
about how relationships
get into our bodies
and affect our physical
health is through stress,
that we're having stressful experiences
often all day long, and that's normal.
And that when we're
stressed, the body is meant
to go into what we call
fight or flight mode,
where essentially heart rate
goes up, might start to sweat,
a variety of changes happen.
But then when the stressor is removed,
the body is meant to
return to equilibrium.
What we think happens is that
if I have something stressful
happen during the day
and I can go home and talk
to a friend or call someone,
I can literally feel my body calm down.
If I don't have anyone I can talk to
about something that happens
in my life that's stressful,
we believe what happens is we
stay in a kind of low level
chronic fight or flight mode.
</details>

### 慢性压力与健康风险

中文翻译:
这意味着我们体内循环的**皮质醇**（cortisol）等压力激素水平升高，身体长期处于高水平的**炎症**（inflammation）状态。这些变化会逐渐侵蚀不同的身体系统，这就是为什么压力和孤独感会增加患**冠状动脉疾病**（coronary artery disease）、**2型糖尿病**（type two diabetes）或**关节炎**（arthritis）的风险，通过慢性压力的共同作用影响多个身体系统。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
And what that means is
that we have higher levels
of circulating stress
hormones like cortisol.
We have higher levels of inflammation
going on in the body all the time,
and that these changes gradually wear away
different body systems,
which is how stress and loneliness
could make it more likely
that we would get coronary artery disease
and more likely that we
would get type two diabetes
or arthritis could affect
multiple body systems
through this common
denominator of chronic stress.
</details>

### 连接带来的生理益处

中文翻译:
我们的理解是，良好的人际关系实际上是**情绪调节器**（emotion regulators）。良好关系涉及积极情感的交流，有助于我们的身体保持平衡。事实上，研究人员将人们置于MRI扫描仪中，观察他们在经历压力性医疗程序时的反应。他们发现，如果患者握着别人的手（即使是陌生人，但肯定包括认识的人），他们的身体会比独自经历同一程序时更接近平衡状态。这表明，与他人建立联系能让我们感到更安全，并使我们的身体维持一种有利于健康的生理平衡。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
Our understanding is
that good relationships
actually are emotion regulators,
that what happens is
that good relationships
involve the exchange of positive emotion
that helps our bodies stay in equilibrium.
So in fact, they've put
people in MRI scanners
and watched what happens to them
when they go through a
stressful medical procedure,
and they find that if they're
holding someone's hand,
even a stranger, but
certainly someone they know,
their bodies stay much
closer to equilibrium
than if they're alone undergoing
the same medical procedure.
And so what it shows us
is that being connected to another person
makes us feel safer and keeps our bodies
at a kind of physiologic
equilibrium that promotes health.
</details>

### 有毒关系与健康关系的区别

中文翻译:
**有毒的关系**（toxic relationship）是指我们无法超越其中的困难、不快和愤怒，无法回到彼此都感觉良好的状态。因此，有毒的关系即使表面平静，也包含着不快乐、长期的怨恨、常常的退缩，以及激烈的争吵。另一方面，夫妻之间经常争吵，但未必会产生这些有害影响。我们的研究发现，夫妻可以经常且大声地争吵，但如果他们之间有**深厚的感情和尊重**（bedrock of affection and respect）作为基础，这些关系就能持续保持积极和稳定。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
A toxic relationship is one
where we can't get beyond
difficulties, unhappiness, anger.
We can't come out the other side
to a place where we're
okay again with each other.
And so a toxic relationship
involves unhappiness,
even if you're quiet about it.
Chronic resentment, often withdrawal,
and then active arguing.
On the other hand,
couples argue all the time
without having these detrimental effects.
What we've found from our research
is that couples can argue
often and quite vocally,
but if there is a bedrock
of affection and respect,
those relationships continue
to be positive and stable.
</details>

### 敌对关系对健康的危害

中文翻译:
研究表明，孤独无疑是一种压力源，会导致压力激素和慢性炎症水平升高。但研究也显示，一段关系中持续的**敌对情绪**（acrimony）、不断的争吵和不快乐，同样会出于同样的原因危害我们的健康。事实上，一项研究表明，长期处于一段非常糟糕的有毒亲密关系中，可能比分手对健康更不利。因为一段极其困难、充满敌意的关系是慢性压力的根源，它让我们大部分时间处于“战或逃”模式，并破坏我们的身体系统。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
Research shows us that loneliness
is certainly a stressor
and that we have increased
levels of stress hormones,
increased levels of chronic inflammation,
but research also shows us that
ongoing acrimony in a relationship,
constant arguing and unhappiness,
is also hazardous to our health
for just the same reasons.
So there was in fact
a study that suggested
that staying in a really
toxic intimate relationship
may be worse than splitting
up for that reason
because a really difficult
acrimonious relationship
is that source of chronic stress
that keeps us in fight or
flight mode most of the time
and breaks down our body systems.
</details>

### 关系对大脑衰老的影响

中文翻译:
研究表明，晚年拥有稳定伴侣连接的人，其**大脑衰退速度较慢**。此外，研究还显示，晚年感到孤独的人，大脑衰退速度更快。因此，我们知道，这种压力增加或减少的相同过程，会影响我们的大脑衰老方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>
The research shows that people
who have a secure connection
with a partner in late life
have slower brain decline.
In addition, the research shows
that people who are lonely in late life
have more rapid brain decline.
So we know that this same
process of increased stress
or decreased stress
affects how our brains age.
</details>
