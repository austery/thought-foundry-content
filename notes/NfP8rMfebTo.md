---

### 摩根大通新总部大楼的落成

Anyone who has been, you know, in Manhattan in the last couple of years, if you've just looked up toward the sky and tilted your head toward midtown, you would have seen this building.
过去几年里，任何在曼哈顿的人，只要抬头望向天空，将头转向中城，都会看到这座建筑。

And it's quite tall.
它非常高。

I think it has one of, if not the highest occupied floors in the city or like at least for office buildings, something like that.
我认为它是城市中 occupiied 层数最高的建筑之一，或者至少在办公楼中是这样。

And it has been in the works since 2018.
它自 2018 年以来一直在建设中。

And so finally now employees started moving in in August.
终于，员工们在八月份开始迁入。

And later this month they'll have the official ribbon cutting.
本月晚些时候将举行正式的落成典礼。

And so that is this new tower to be the headquarters for Jpmorgan, which is the biggest U.S. bank.
这座新塔楼将成为美国最大银行摩根大通的总部。

### 摩根大通的地产扩张战略

But along the way, they realized that they would need more space than just that.
但在此过程中，他们意识到需要的空间不仅仅是这一个。

So they have 383 Madison, where it's right across the street from the new tower, and that has been their temporary headquarters.
所以他们有麦迪逊大道 383 号，就在新塔楼对面，那里一直是他们的临时总部。

They got that building when they bought Bear Stearns during the financial crisis, and they have embarked on plans to completely remake that building like inside and outside renovation.
他们在金融危机期间收购贝尔斯登时获得了这栋大楼，并计划对其进行彻底的翻新，包括内外装修。

And then they also own another building across the street from that that they bought last year.
然后，他们还在去年收购了街对面另一栋大楼。

And then they also bought a fourth building in 2020 that they've been using as kind of a staging ground for the construction project anymore.
此外，他们还在 2020 年收购了第四栋大楼，并将其用作建筑项目的准备场地。

### 摩根大通地产规模惊人

How many buildings are we talking about this space?
我们说的是这个区域有多少栋建筑？

Okay. Yeah. So it's it's a lot.
好的。是的。数量很多。

It's like the their square footage of office space right in that couple block radius is about the same as Goldman is for the entirety of North and South America.
在这个几个街区半径范围内，他们的办公空间面积与高盛在整个北美和南美的办公空间面积大致相当。

Okay. Wow. Yeah. Well.
好的。哇。是的。嗯。

### 鼓励员工重返办公室的措施

Well, of course, this coincides with the push to return to office, Right.
当然，这与推动重返办公室的趋势不谋而合，对吧？

Do we have any details and kind of what exactly will entice employees to really kind of spend all that time there and stay there and potentially, you know, maybe enjoy their work a little bit as they spend maybe like 1230 nowadays?
我们是否有一些细节，具体会是什么激励员工在那里花那么多时间，并待在那里，甚至可能，你知道，在他们现在可能花费 12-13 小时工作的时间里，稍微享受一下工作？

So Jamie Dimon has definitely been at the forefront of the kind of like auto push.
所以杰米·戴蒙无疑一直是推动重返办公室的倡导者。

So I think for a lot of people inside Jp morgan that. Issue was kind of in the past because they've been going to the office most, if not all the time for a while now.
所以我想对于摩根大通内部的许多人来说，这个问题在过去已经解决了，因为他们已经去办公室很长一段时间了，如果不是一直都在的话。

But. This new building has a lot of things that will entice someone to want to be in the office, right?
但是，这座新建筑有很多吸引人想去办公室的设施，对吧？

So they have like a wellness center that has a good fitness center.
他们有一个健康中心，里面有一个不错的健身房。

They have a pub. Okay. Or is this all. I don't know.
他们还有一个酒吧。好的。这些都是真的吗？我不知道。

I need to go do some investigative journalism, investigative reporting to get back to you on the ground reporting for sure.
我需要去做一些调查性新闻报道，实地采访，才能告诉你确切的情况。

But yeah, so it's and also, I mean, just all the kind of bells and whistles that come with the new building.
但是，是的，而且，你知道，新建筑带来的所有这些“花哨”的设施。

All right. Like it's cool to like, we are blessed to be in a cool headquarters ourselves and it's nice to be in a court building.
好的。比如，我们也很幸运能拥有一个很棒的总部，能待在一栋很棒的建筑里。

So there's that. I mean, and I used to cover commercial real estate for the print side before moving over to TV and still keeping eyes on the real estate market.
所以有这一方面。我的意思是，在我转到电视部门之前，我曾为平面媒体报道过商业地产，并且至今仍在关注房地产市场。

### 现代办公楼的吸引力

But we talk so much about the class buildings, right?
但我们总是谈论那些一流的建筑，对吧？

You mentioned Bloomberg. We talk about Jp morgan.
你提到了彭博社。我们也谈论摩根大通。

And as you're thinking about the art push, of course, they're really targeting these newer buildings or either building ground up or they're occupying one, renovating it.
当你想到重返办公室的推动时，当然，他们真的在瞄准这些较新的建筑，要么是自建，要么是租赁并翻新。

You know, you talked about the things that are really luring these people into the office.
你知道，你谈到了那些真正吸引人们去办公室的东西。

Are there enough bodies to make up all this square footage that you're talking about?
有足够的人来填补你所说的所有这些建筑面积吗？

They have enough people. Yeah. So they come.
他们有足够的人。是的。所以他们会来。

And is there more than 17,000 corporate employees?
公司员工是否超过 17,000 人？

So that doesn't include people who work in branches in New York.
这还不包括在纽约分支机构工作的人员。

So that was part of the thing when it was more a question of like hot desking and things like that.
所以，这部分也与“热座位”（hot desking）等概念有关。

They were saying, Oh, maybe we can fit, you know, 14,000 people in this new building.
他们曾说，哦，也许我们可以容纳 14,000 人在新建筑里。

And then they brought that number down to about 10,000 as they required more and more people to come back to the office more frequently.
然后，随着他们要求越来越多的人更频繁地返回办公室，他们将这个数字降至约 10,000 人。

### 摩根大通的“不竞争”协议

Are they still doing. One of the banks that are doing the non competes for a lot of their junior employees coming in saying you can't you design this, you can't work anywhere else as Jp morgan, one of those like for the the private equity job. Right.
他们还在实行“不竞争”协议吗？是否像某些银行那样，对其许多初级员工实行“不竞争”协议，规定他们不能从事某些设计工作，不能在摩根大通以外的其他地方工作，例如私募股权职位？

Yeah. They were at the forefront of that too. And there you go.
是的。他们在这方面也处于领先地位。

Jamie, the CEO, is very vocal, so they find themselves on the forefront of a lot of Great Wall Street.
杰米·戴蒙（Jamie Dimon）作为 CEO，非常直言不讳，因此他们发现自己处于许多华尔街大事的前沿。

You want to have a nice office that you can keep people in for sure if they're coming in in 12 to 13 hours in.
如果你希望员工每天来办公室工作 12 到 13 个小时，你肯定需要一个舒适的办公环境。

Yes. But also, I mean, it's worth pointing out that and you know, our story today kind of dug into this, that.
是的。但同样值得指出的是，你知道，我们今天的故事也深入探讨了这一点。

Under like Jimmy has been CEO of Jp morgan for almost 20 years now.
杰米·戴蒙担任摩根大通 CEO 至今已有近 20 年。

He's built it into the biggest and most profitable US bank by far.
他已将其打造成美国迄今为止规模最大、利润最丰厚的银行。

And so this new building, but also this campus that's in the works are really kind of a physical manifestation of that dominance.
因此，这座新建筑以及正在建设中的这个园区，确实是这种主导地位的实体体现。

And I think, you know, I can't think of any other. Corporate campus type thing in the middle of Manhattan.
我想，我实在想不出在曼哈顿市中心还有其他的企业园区式项目。

So it seems kind of unusual in that way and kind of unprecedented.
所以从这个角度来看，它似乎有些不寻常，而且可以说是前所未有。

Yeah, Well, it's certainly a testament to just how much it has set itself apart for sure.
是的，嗯，这无疑证明了它在多大程度上脱颖而出。

### 华尔街的盈利前景与消费者状况

But yeah, I mean, speaking of how much it has set itself apart, I mean, we're going to get the most recent look at that next week because all the big banks are going to be reporting to kick off earnings season.
但说起它如何脱颖而出，下周我们就会看到最新的情况，因为所有大银行都将公布财报，开启财报季。

So I want to ask Sally, you know, last season the theme was a trading bonanza because of all the market volatility that we saw in a second quarter.
所以我想问萨莉，上个季度，由于我们在第二季度看到了大量的市场波动，主题是交易狂潮。

Is that the case this time around as well?
这次也是如此吗？

It looks like Wall Street is again going to do pretty well from this persistent volatility and certainly with JPMorgan.
看起来华尔街将再次从这种持续的波动中获益，摩根大通也一样。

We're expecting trading to be up from a year ago.
我们预计交易收入将比去年同期有所增长。

And investment banking is also supposed to be up from a year ago as well.
投资银行业务预计也将比去年同期有所增长。

And in terms of investment banking and deal making, Dimon said yesterday that in an interview the animal spirits are starting to come back.
在投资银行和交易撮合方面，戴蒙昨天在接受采访时表示，“动物精神”正在回归。

We're seeing deal making pick up, which was something long awaited and long anticipated after Trump came back in, sort of promising this more friendly regulatory regime.
我们看到交易活动有所增加，这在特朗普上台并承诺更加友好的监管环境后，是人们长期以来一直期待的。

And indeed, we did have a big bank merger just announced with fifth Third agreeing to buy Comerica.
确实，我们刚刚宣布了一项大型银行合并案，第五联合银行（Fifth Third）同意收购康梅瑞卡银行（Comerica）。

And yes, indeed, the continued volatility is likely to also help traders across Wall Street as well.
是的，持续的波动很可能也会帮助华尔街的交易员。

But then there's the other side, too.
但另一方面也有其他情况。

Earnings for banks like Jp morgan, which have big, fast consumer businesses.
像摩根大通这样拥有庞大、活跃的消费者业务的银行的收益。

You know how the consumer is holding up.
你知道消费者的情况如何。

And what's been very interesting out of earnings in recent quarters is that the consumer, despite all of these very complex and difficult pressures and forces like persistent inflation, the consumer still seems to be holding up.
近几个季度财报中非常有趣的一点是，尽管消费者面临持续的通货膨胀等复杂而艰难的压力和力量，但他们似乎仍然状况良好。

And in fact, again, Diamond said yesterday that consumers are fine now.
事实上，戴蒙昨天再次表示，消费者目前状况良好。

And I think he noted that both high and low income income consumers are still spending.
我想他提到，无论是高收入还是低收入消费者，都在继续消费。

But he did warn that a recession could happen in 2026 and reiterated his concerns that he's made numerous times that inflation may be slower to come down than we would like.
但他确实警告说，2026 年可能会发生经济衰退，并重申了他多次表达的担忧，即通胀可能比我们希望的更慢下降。

And of course, we're in conversation with Hannah Levitt and Sally Bakewell, Sally Bakewell at Leeds. Our coverage here in the U.S. in New York Office of Finance and Sally Bakewell are in.
当然，我们正在与汉娜·莱维特（Hannah Levitt）和萨莉·贝克韦尔（Sally Bakewell）进行交流，萨莉·贝克韦尔在利兹。我们在纽约金融办公室的美国报道团队，以及萨莉·贝克韦尔也在。

Hannah, you closely cover JPMorgan. So, Sally, I want to continue on with you about the theme of the U.S. consumer here.
汉娜，你密切关注摩根大通。所以，萨莉，我想和你继续探讨美国消费者这个主题。

I mean, is this any sort of rhetoric that you're also hearing from other banks that you guys are keeping an eye on?
你的意思是，你们也在关注其他银行是否也有类似的言论吗？

Is this Jamie Dimon alone or is this something that we're hearing widespread?
这是杰米·戴蒙一家之言，还是普遍听到的情况？

It's definitely across the board for the bigger Wall Street banks.
这绝对是华尔街大银行普遍的情况。

They have seldom been able to find pressure on the consumer.
他们很少能发现消费者面临压力。

It's been quite puzzling for and it honestly, you know, it's been puzzling for us.
这令人费解，坦白说，这让我们感到困惑。

It sometimes sounds puzzling for them.
有时这似乎也让他们感到困惑。

But I think, you know, there's a broader trend that's been happening since the financial crisis, which is that a lot of these bigger banks, they haven't been lending as much to low income income consumers, which probably are starting to see the strain.
但我想，你知道，自金融危机以来，一直存在一个更广泛的趋势，那就是许多大银行对低收入消费者的贷款减少了，而这些消费者可能已经开始感受到压力。

And so that probably explains why consumers are still looking in sort of rude health at the moment for most of the banks.
因此，这或许可以解释为什么目前大多数银行的消费者看起来仍然状况良好。
