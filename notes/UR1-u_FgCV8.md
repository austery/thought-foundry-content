### 书评人畅谈2025年度阅读体验

我是《纽约时报》书评编辑吉尔伯特·克鲁兹（Gilbert Cruz），欢迎收听本期书评播客。上周，我们回顾了年度十大好书。本周，我们将带来同样精彩的内容：我们的特约书评人将分享他们2025年度的阅读历程。

<p class="english-text">Hello, I'm Gilbert Cruz, editor of the New York Times Book Review, and this is the book review podcast. Last week, you heard our episode on the 10 best books of the year. That's [music] the collective hour, the collective we. And this week, we have something just as interesting, which is our staff book critics are going to talk about their years in reading.</p>

自青少年时期以来，我生命中的一大乐趣便是阅读各种年终榜单，无论是关于书籍、电影、音乐，还是其他任何事物。我会在不同的出版物上阅读它们，当然也会阅读那些我极力反对的评论家的观点。评论家的首要任务之一就是忠于自我，用自己独特而特立独行的头脑去体验文化，然后将这种体验告诉他们的受众。

<p class="english-text">One of the great joys in my life since I was a teenager has [music] been reading year-end list after year-end list in December on books and movies and music and really everything. I read [music] them across publications and definitely across critics, even those critics I intensely disagree [music] with. It's one of the primary tasks of a critic to simply be themselves to experience culture with their own unique [music] and idiosyncratic minds and then tell their audience about that experience.</p>

今天来到我身边的，就是三位杰出、独特且特立独行的思想者，他们将与我们分享他们对今年书籍的体验。德怀特·加纳（Dwight Garner），欢迎你。

### 德怀特·加纳的“金句”选集

有太多值得聊的了。你们三位，就像过去三年一样，都以自己独特的方式回顾了今年喜欢的几本书。我想先从德怀特开始，他总是喜欢给我们带来惊喜。今年你做了一个“金句”榜单，你会怎么形容它？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> There's so much to talk about. The three of you, as you have done for the past three years, have done each in your own way, a unique look back at a couple of books or several books that you enjoyed this year. I want to start with Dwight, who just loves to mess with us and this year [laughter] did a list of great How would you describe it? It's a list of sentences that I loved from the books that I read this year and I ran them together to make them comment upon one another and tried to make them funny and provocative.</p>
</details>

>> 这是你一直以来所做的，就像我们在这档播客中讨论过的，你有一个叫做“集锦簿”（commonplace book）的本子，里面记录了所有这些句子。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> And you can do this because as we've talked about on this podcast before, you have a book, commonplace book as it is called, in which you keep all these lines.</p>
</details>

>> 是的。而且今年是句子的大年。我认为句子是我最喜欢的散文单元。很多人喜欢整本书，喜欢整首诗。我喜欢绝妙的句子。我喜欢那种简短、犀利、令人震惊的句子。那种声音。我喜欢聪明的东西，聪明且表达得当的东西。作为读者，我就是为了这个而活。所以我热爱句子。

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> Yeah. And it was a good year for sentences. I think that the sentence is my favorite unit of prose. A lot of people love the book. They love the entire poem. I love the ideal sentence. I love it. Short, sharp, shocked. the voice. I like something intelligent, something that's intelligent and really well expressed. That's what I live for as a reader. And so I love sentences.</p>
