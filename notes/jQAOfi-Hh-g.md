### 科技巨头IPO与市场趋势

**Tracy Aloway**: 感觉2026年对于一些已经私有化很久的超级IPO来说，可能会是重要的一年。有传言说**SpaceX**可能会IPO，也许还有一些大型**AI**实验室。一些非常庞大的公司可能很快就会进入市场。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: Tracy, it feels like 2026 could be a big year for some mega IPOs that have been private for a while. There's talk about a **SpaceX** IPO, possibly maybe some of the big **AI** labs. Like some pretty massive companies that might be hitting the market soon.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 最近有人给了我一顶**摩根大通**的**Facebook** IPO帽子，他们当时参与了。我非常自豪，需要开始在办公室里戴着它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Someone recently gave me a **Facebook** IPO hat from **JP Morgan** when they worked on it. I'm very proud. I need to start wearing it around the office.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 是的，我记得。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: Yeah, I remember.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 但那是一个超级IPO。当时是一个超级IPO。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: But that was like that was a mega IPO. There was a mega

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 当时，市场对此非常炒作，然后出现了技术困难。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: at the time and there was so much hype about it and then like technical difficulties and

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 很多人都渴望参与其中。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: so many people eager to get in on that one.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 很多人都开玩笑说那是一场失败，我想是因为技术困难，而且它在一段时间内表现不佳。那会是买入的好时机。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: It's so many funny people called that a flop I guess because the technical difficulties and it didn't do that great for a little bit. That would have been a great time to buy it.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 是的，确实如此。市场有趣的一点是，有些公司在IPO时已经非常庞大。人们指出，在早期，它们可能在市值达到10亿美元时就IPO了，而现在它们已经像“八角兽”或类似规模了。还有一些公司也同样庞大，但它们是否会IPO尚不清楚。我看到一条关于**Stripe**可能正在募集更多资金的头条新闻。人们认为它们几年前可能就已经IPO了。我的问题是，公司选择不IPO或推迟IPO，是因为公开市场不再那么有趣，还是因为私募市场变得更加富裕、流动性更强，以至于上市的冲动不再像上一代那样强烈？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: Yeah. And seriously, the interesting thing about the market or one of the interesting things about the market is you have these companies that are going to IPO when they're already gigantic. So people point out that in earlier eras they might have IPOed when they're like billion-dollar companies and now they're like octicorns or whatever. And then you have other companies that are also enormous and there's no it's not clear that they're going to IPO at all. I saw a headline about **Stripe** perhaps raising more money. People been they could have probably IPOed years ago. And one of the questions I have is are companies choosing not to IPO or delaying IPO because the public market is not that fun or because the private market has gotten so much richer, so much more liquid, etc. that that impulse to go public just isn't the same way as it might have been in a different generation.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 是的，这在市场上已经是一个长期存在的问题了。但我想指出最后一点，在我看来，私募市场的公司，即使它们在私募市场，理论上资本池应该更小，但它们似乎总是在融资。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Yeah, this has kind of been a longunning question in the market for a while now. But one thing I would just point out on the last point, it feels to me like companies in the private market, even though they're in the private market where presumably the pool of capital is smaller. Yeah, it feels like they're always fundraising.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 这也是另一回事，当我开始报道科技公司时，它们有A轮、B轮、C轮融资，而现在，尤其是一些**AI**公司，似乎总是在进行融资。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: This is the other thing too that it used to be when I started covering tech companies, it's like your series A round and series B round and C and now it just seems like this permanent round, especially with some of the **AI** companies,

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 永远在融资。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: always be raising,

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 永远在融资。总之，我们需要更多地了解巨型公司是如何看待公共和私募资本市场的。我很高兴地说，我们确实请到了完美的嘉宾。我们将与**David George**对话。他是**Andreessen Horowitz**（**A16Z**）增长基金的负责人。他非常适合解释所有这些正在发生的事情。**David**，非常感谢你来OddLots。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: always raising. Anyway, we need to learn more about how giant companies are thinking about capital markets, both public and private. And I'm really excited to say we do in fact absolutely have the perfect guest. We're going to be speaking with **David George**. He is the head of the growth fund at **Andreessen Horowitz** **A16Z**. Someone perfectly situated to explain of all these things that's going on. So **David**, thank you so much for coming on OddLots.

</details>

**David George**: 大家好，很高兴和你们在一起。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David George**: Hey, great to be with you all.

### 增长基金的定义与投资策略

**Tracy Aloway**: 什么是增长基金？我以为所有VC都是增长型投资。当我们谈论私募市场中的增长基金或增长轮次时，这意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: What is a growth fund? What is the I thought all VC was growth. What does it mean when we talk about a growth fund or a growth round when we're talking about private markets?

</details>

**David George**: 是的，首先，很高兴和你们在一起。谢谢邀请我。很高兴能进行这次对话。我们的早期基金也投资于快速增长的公司。所以，如果这不清楚，那就是我们在所有资本池中寻求做的事情。对我们来说，增长基金是投资于公司生命周期后期阶段的基金。所以通常是它们找到了**产品市场契合度**之后。而我们的早期基金则投资于那些正在努力寻找**产品市场契合度**的早期公司。我们投资于那些已经找到**产品市场契合度**的公司。这就是区别。目前我们正在投资我们的第五支增长基金。它大约是70亿美元的基金。如果将我们五支基金的承诺资本加起来，总承诺资本约为220亿美元。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David George**: Yeah. So, our first of all, it's great to be with you all. Thanks for having me. Excited to have this conversation. So, our early stage funds invest in companies that are growing fast too. So, if that's not clear, that is what we seek to do across all pools capital. For us, the growth fund is a fund that invests in companies at the later stage of their life cycle. So typically once they found **product market fit** and our early stage funds invest in companies early stage when they're kind of trying to find **product market fit**. We invest in companies once they have found **product market fit**. So that's the delineation. Right now we're investing out of our fifth growth fund. It's about a $7 billion fund. If you combine the committed capital of our five funds it's about $22 billion in overall committed capital.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 哇。增长基金中直接来自早期基金的比例是多少？因为我想这对你们来说是一个很好的渠道，对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Wow. What percentage of the growth fund is sort of directly obtained from the early stage funds? Because I imagine that's like that's a good pipeline for you guys, right?

</details>

**David George**: 是的，这对我们来说是一个很好的渠道。我们两者都做。所以，我们有从早期阶段投资的例子，也有由于某种原因我们不是早期投资者而投资的公司。我们增长基金中一些最大的投资是像**DataBricks**和**Stripe**这样的公司，我们是它们的早期投资者。然后一些最大的投资是像**SpaceX**、**OpenAI**、**Whimo**、**Roblox**和**Figma**这样的公司，我们不是它们的早期投资者。我们第一次投资是在增长基金中。所以大约是50/50。我们喜欢投资那些我们非常了解创始人的公司。我们经常谈论的一件事是“比赛录像”。这是公开市场投资者非常熟悉的东西。他们寻找“比赛录像”。他们希望支持那些已经证明持续成功的CEO和管理团队。我们也力求在私募市场中做同样的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David George**: Yeah, it's a great pipeline for us. We do both. So, we have examples of investments out of the early stage and in companies that for whatever reason we were not early stage investors. So, some of our largest investments in the growth fund are are companies like **DataBricks** and **Stripe** that we were early stage investors in. And then some of the largest investments are companies like **SpaceX** and **OpenAI** and **Whimo** and **Roblox** and **Figma** that we were not early stage investors in. And the first time that we invested was in the growth fund. So it's about 50/50. We love to invest in companies where we know the founders really well. One of the things we talk about all the time is game film. This is something that public market investors are very familiar with. They look for game film. They want to back CEOs, management teams that have demonstrated continued success. And we seek to do the same thing in the private markets.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 我喜欢**Andreessen Horowitz**如此有影响力和主导地位，以至于如果你随便说一些大型公司，它们都是最重要的、正在成长的科技公司，它们实际上都将是你们投资的公司。我提到**SpaceX**、**Stripe**等等，我并不是故意想说一堆**A16Z**家族的公司。它们只是偶然地被我提到了。你觉得呢？让我们从大局来看这个问题：公司长期保持私有化，尤其是那些蓬勃发展的公司，表现非常好的公司，如果上市，也会在生命周期后期才上市。有很多具体问题，但从大局来看，这个趋势的故事是什么？主要原因是什么？这个趋势是如何演变的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: I like how **Andreessen Horowitz** is so influential and dominant that if you just name a bunch of random big companies that are all sort of like the most important like growing tech companies, they're actually just going to all be, you know, like when I said **SpaceX**, **Stripe**, etc. I didn't purposely say name try to name a bunch of **A16Z** family companies. They just incidentally happened to me. What do you like? Let's start big picture with this question of companies staying private for longer especially thriving companies companies that are doing very well IPOing if at all much later in their life cycle there are a lot of specific questions but big picture what's the story what's the main cause of this the evolution of this trend

</details>

**David George**: 是的，当然。首先，我想先用数据来阐述一下实际情况。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David George**: Yeah, absolutely. Well first I would love to just set the stage with what the what the data actually is like what's actually happened

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 如果我完全错了，那也很有趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: if I'm totally wrong that's also interesting

</details>

**David George**: 不，不，你没有完全错。我有很多事实来支持你的说法，但这些数字确实令人瞠目结舌。如果你看私募市场，高估值的科技公司在私募市场中代表着大约5万亿美元的市值。这几乎是**标普500指数**的四分之一。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David George**: No, no, you're not totally wrong. I have a bunch of supporting facts to your statement, but the numbers are pretty eye popping. So, if you look at the private markets, highly valued technology companies represent about $5 trillion of market cap in the private markets. That's almost a quarter of the **S&P 500**.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 哇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Wow.

</details>

**David George**: 它是**纳斯达克**的15%。如果你排除**MAG 7**，它是40%。所以这些数字非常惊人。正如你所说，世界上一些最大最好的公司都在私募市场中。最大的10家私有公司占了那5万亿美元市值的40%。所以这是一个巨大的**幂律**游戏，最好的公司在生命周期的那个阶段恰好都在私募市场，而不是在公开市场。私募市场这个5万亿美元市值的经济部门在10年内增长了10倍。与此同时，上市公司数量，你们可能以前报道过，在过去20年里减少了一半。所以这只是公开市场和私募市场构成上的巨大转变。正如你所说，最好的公司今天大部分都在私募市场。我们寻找的另一件事，我们是一个增长基金，但增长意味着很多东西。我们寻找那些正在经历**超高速增长**的公司。我们称之为**超高速增长**。增长非常非常快。我们增长基金的平均投资增长率约为100%。如果你看今天的公开市场，我们所关注的上市公司中，只有三家公司的增长率超过30%。所以如果你真的想投资增长最快、最有前途的公司，那些可能成为下一个**MAG 7**的公司，它们很可能在私募市场。所以这只是动态上的一个巨大转变，在过去20年，甚至过去10或15年都是如此。这就是这个趋势背后的数字。问题是为什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David George**: It's 15% of the **NASDAQ**. It's 40% if you exclude the **MAG 7**. So, it's just staggering numbers. To your point about some of the biggest and best companies in the world being in the private markets, the 10 largest private companies represent 40% of that five trillion of market cap. So this is a massive power law game and the best of the best companies at that stage of their life cycle just happen to be in the private markets and not in the public markets right now. That private market kind of five trillion of market cap that sector of the economy has grown 10x in 10 years. At the same time, the number of public companies, you guys have probably covered this before, the number of public companies has been cut in half over the last 20 years. So, this is just a massive shift in the composition of the public markets and the private markets. And the best of the best companies, as you said, largely are sitting in the private markets today. The other thing that we look for, we're a growth fund, but growth means a lot of things. We look for companies that are growing, sort of **hypergrowth**. We call it **hypergrowth**. Growing very very fast. The average investment in our growth fund is growing about 100%. If you look at the public markets today, there's only three companies in our universe that are growing over 30%. So if you actually want to invest in the highest growth, most promising companies that could be that next **MAG 7**, chances are they're in the private market. So this is this is just a big shift in the dynamics, certainly in the last 20 years, but even the last 10 or 15. So that's the numbers behind the trend. The question is why.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: Yeah.

</details>

### 私募市场为何更具吸引力

**David George**: 有很多原因。你一开始就提到了。公开市场存在结构性原因，使得现在成为上市公司比20年前更困难。我认为最重要的一点是，私募资本市场比以前更深入、流动性更强。因此，公司在需要更多资本之前，上市的需求就减少了。在私募市场中，最好的公司可以获得所需的资本。对于创始人来说，能够留在私募市场并随着时间获得流动性，这是一个非常有吸引力的选择。如果你是少数能够以低成本在私募市场获得资本的公司之一，你就可以稳步控制股价波动。你可以定期进行**要约收购**。对于一家公司来说，除了获得资本之外，最困难的事情可能是员工管理。如果你能在私募市场中，在没有波动性的情况下，获得与公开市场非常接近的动态，那么留在私募市场就非常有吸引力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David George**: And there's lots of reasons why this is the case. I mean you mentioned it right at the outset. There are structural reasons in the public markets that make it harder to be a public company now than it was 20 years ago. I think the biggest thing is the private capital markets are deeper and more liquid than before. So there's less of a need for a company to go public until they need much much much more capital. In the private markets for the best of the best companies. They kind of have the access to the capital that they need. It's a pretty compelling pitch for the founder to be able to stay in the private markets, have liquidity over time. If you're one of a select few that can access capital, in the private markets cheaply, you can kind of steadily control the stock price movements. You can regularly run **tender offers**. And, for a company, probably the hardest thing aside from access to capital is employee management. And if you can get pretty close to the dynamics that you get in the public markets without volatility, it's pretty compelling to remain in the private markets.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 我有很多关于私募资本增长的问题。但在那之前，你说上市存在结构性挑战。我想我们总是听到的是，你必须提交季度报告。我并不是指那些文书工作，我对此表示同情，因为我讨厌填写表格之类的东西。但公开市场被认为比私募市场困难得多，或者说运营上更头疼的原因是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: So I have a bunch of questions on just the growth of private capital. But before we get to that, you said there are structural challenges in going public. And I guess the one we always hear is like, oh, you have to file quarterly paperwork. Like not the paperwork, which I actually sympathize with because I hate filling out forms and things like that. But like what are the reasons that the public market is perceived to be so much more difficult or so much more of a operational headache I guess than private?

</details>

**David George**: 嗯，这确实有成本。对于像**SpaceX**、**DataBricks**、**OpenAI**或**Stripe**这样规模的公司来说，这并不是非常重要，但对于一家较小的公司来说，这可能需要1000万到2000万美元。如果你是一家15年前可能已经上市的公司，在运营5年后，营收达到1亿美元，那这笔钱就非常可观了。这是一个重大的变化。所以你会想等待更长的时间。今天的公开市场、投资者、投资银行、研究机构更倾向于大型公司，或者至少是中型公司，而不是小型公司。所以如果你是一家小型公司，就很难引起投资者的注意。他们不能写出非常大的支票，也不能在你身上建立庞大的头寸。投资银行或研究分析师可能觉得覆盖你并不值得。所以，如果出现这种情况，就很难引起优秀投资者的注意，并使你的股价随着时间增长。这些是结构性挑战的几个例子。另一个就是波动性。这一代的创始人经历了2021年的上涨，然后是2022年和2023年的下跌，尤其是在科技市场。他们中的一些人在私募市场中重置了股价。但那是一个波动很大的时期。如果你在高峰期向员工发放股票，然后员工看到他们的股票奖励说：“天哪，这些股票跌了70%。”我的薪酬一下子被削减了70%。这对创始人来说是一个很难处理的动态。如果你作为创始人，能在私募市场中尽量减少这种波动性，我理解你为什么会这样做。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David George**: Well, there is a cost. So, for a company the size of **SpaceX** or **DataBricks** or **OpenAI** or **Stripe**, it's not hugely meaningful, but for a smaller company, it could be 10 to 20 million bucks. And if you're a company that would have gone public 15 years ago, 5 years into your life doing 100 million bucks of revenue, that's pretty meaningful. Like that's a major change. And so you'll want to wait longer. Public markets, investors, investment banks, research organizations are tilted much more toward large cap companies or at least midsize companies today and less so towards small cap. So if you're a small cap company, it's just very hard to get the attention of investors. They can't write very large checks and build huge positions in you. It may not be worth the investment bank's time or the research analyst time to cover you. And so, if that's the case, it's hard to get the attention of good investors and make your stock price grow over time. So those are a couple examples of the structural challenges. The other one is just volatility. This generation of founders has seen the 2021 runup and then the certainly in the technology market and then the fall-off in 22 and 23 and some of them have reset their stock prices in the private markets. But that was a volatile time. Like if you were issuing stock to an employee at the peak and then you know that employee was looking at their stock grants and saying, "Oh my gosh, these are down 70%." Like my comp just got cut by 70%. That's a hard dynamic for a founder to have to deal with. And if you can minimize some of that volatility in the private markets as a founder, I understand why you would do it.

</details>

### 员工激励与流动性方案

**Tracy Aloway**: 跟我们谈谈员工保留、员工管理。员工喜欢IPO。他们喜欢流动性。现在可以通过**要约收购**，让他们把一部分股票卖给新的投资者。还有其他一些动态，比如有很多**特殊目的载体**（**SPV**），也许还有代币，让人们可以在私募市场对冲他们的持股，或者通过**hyperliquid**之类的平台。跟我们谈谈员工在私有公司中现在拥有的各种选择，以及如何获得流动性，从而真正获得一些真金白银。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: Talk to us about employee retention, employee management. Employees, you know, they love an IPO. They love liquidity and okay, now you can have **tender offers** where they sell some of their stock to new investors. And then there's other dynamics too like because there's all the **SPVS** out there and maybe like tokens where someone can hedge their holdings in a private market on **hyperlquid** or something like that. Talk to us a little bit about the sort of the plethora of options that employees have now in a private companies and getting that liquidity and so they actually get some real money.

</details>

**David George**: 我先解释一下公开市场是如何运作的，然后我们可以将其与私募市场进行对比。如果你是公开市场的员工，并且拥有**受限股票单位**（**RSU**）奖励，基本运作方式是这样的：你每个季度都会收到扣除税费后的净股票存款到你的账户。所以，如果你是**Meta**、**Alphabet**或**Apple**的高薪员工，这就像钟表一样精准。你获得这些奖励，它们进入你的账户，对于一些最高薪的人来说，你每个季度都会有几十万甚至几百万美元进入你的账户。而且这是流动的。它已经扣除了税费。所以你可以转手卖掉它，就像现金薪酬一样。或者在这些公司的情况下，它们在过去10年里价值大幅增长。所以持有股票的员工获得了丰厚的回报。然后他们又获得了新的**RSU**奖励。所以你会有这种随着时间推移**RSU**奖励的“瀑布流”，而且随着时间推移，你每个季度的净存款会增加。所以如果你是一个私有公司的CEO，在竞争人才时，这就是你所竞争的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David George**: Let me start by just explaining the way it works in the public markets and we can contrast the private markets with that. If you're a public market employee and you have **RSU** grants, this is basically the way it works. You get a quarterly deposit of net stock, net of taxes in your account every quarter. And so if you're a highly paid employee at **Meta** or **Alphabet** or **Apple**, it's like clockwork. You get these grants, they hit your account, you have for some of the highest paid people, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars that hit your hit your account every quarter. And that's liquid. It's already netted of tax. And so you can turn around and sell it and it's like cash comp. Or in the case of those companies, they've appreciated tremendously in value over the last 10 years. And so the employees, who help stock have been handsomely rewarded. Then they get **RSU** grants stacked on top of those. So you kind of have this like waterfall of **RSU** grants over time and increasingly, over time your quarterly net deposit can go up. And so if you're a private CEO competing for talent, that's what you're competing with,

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: right?

</details>

**David George**: 那些公司现金充裕。所以他们能够向员工支付大量的股权薪酬。所以这是一个很难竞争的动态。这是说服私有公司CEO应该上市的最强有力的论据之一，因为在公开市场情况下，这对你的员工来说是一个非常有吸引力的财务回报。在私募市场中，通常的运作方式是，你获得这些**RSU**奖励。有时它们会随着时间累积，但通常在公司上市之前它们是缺乏流动性的。现在，在过去六到八年里发生的是，公司会在私募市场进行**要约收购**，他们会提出购买员工已归属股票的某个百分比。所以他们会设定价格。他们会与我们这样的人合作，然后他们会说：“嘿，你可以在这次**要约收购**中出售你已归属股票的25%，我们每年会做一次。”所以这对于我在公开市场描述的情况来说，是一个不错的替代方案。它不是一个完美的替代方案，但对于那些真正的信徒，员工或潜在的新员工来说，我认为这足以对抗**RSU**公开市场动态和薪酬方案。而且它运作得相当好。**SpaceX**就以每年两次为员工进行**要约收购**而闻名，做得非常好。他们拥有极高的员工满意度、招聘能力和留存率。一些最大的科技公司也纷纷效仿。我会说，私募市场的创始人在做权衡，通常如果他们是上市公司，他们的股价可能会更高。所以他们可能承受了更多的稀释，因此员工在公开市场中可能会在估值方面受益更多，但这并不是一个巨大的差距，而且这是一个非常有吸引力的替代方案。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David George**: And those companies are are flushed with cash. And so they're able to pay a lot in stock based comp to their employees. And so that's a difficult dynamic to compete with. That's one of the strongest forms of the argument for telling a private company CEO that they should go public because that is a very compelling financial reward for your employees in that public market situation. In the private markets, the way it typically works is you get, you get these **RSU** grants. Sometimes they stack up over time, but generally they're illiquid until you go public. Now, what's happened over the last, I'd say, six or eight years is companies will do **tender offers** in the private markets where they offer to buy a certain percentage of employees vested stock in the private markets. So they'll set the price. They'll work with somebody like us and they'll say something like, "Hey, you can sell 25% of your vested stock that you have in this **tender offer** and we'll do it once a year." And so that's a decent substitute for what I described in the public markets. It's not a perfect substitute, but for the employees or potential new hires who are true believers, I think it's enough to combat that **RSU** public market dynamic and compensation scheme. And it's worked pretty well. **SpaceX** has, famously done a really good job running twice a year **tender offers** for their employees. And, they've had tremendous employee satisfaction, ability to hire, retention, etc. And some of the biggest tech companies have followed suit. And I would argue that there's a trade-off that the founders in the private markets are making where often if they were public, they probably would have a higher stock price. So maybe they're taking a little bit more dilution and so maybe employees would benefit a little bit more in valuation in the public markets, but it's not a massive gap and it's a it's a pretty compelling alternative.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 旧金山的文化氛围中，人们仍然期望IPO是默认的退出方式，还是这种心态已经消失了？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: just culturally out in San Francisco. Do people still expect like the default exit to be an IPO or has that mindset kind of gone away?

</details>

**David George**: 最好的公司都想IPO，我想你提到了外面一些知名公司，它们可能会长期保持私有化。我认为大多数创始人的抱负仍然是IPO，成为一家大型的、成熟的、重要的上市公司。我们谈到了私募资本池在过去10年里的增长。公开市场的资本池仍然深得多。所以如果你需要筹集500亿、1000亿、2000亿美元，就像一些大型公司可能为了实现其目标而想做的那样，它们很可能会最终进入公开市场。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David George**: The best of the best companies want to IPO and I think you mentioned some of the the big name companies out there who may stay private for a really long time. I think the ambition for most founders is still, to have an IPO and to be a large established important public company. We talked about the pools of private capital and how they've grown over the last 10 years. The pools of capital in the public markets are still much deeper. So if you need to raise 50, 100,200 billion dollars like some of the big big companies may want to do to pursue some of their goals, chances are they'll end up in the public markets.

### SPV的兴起与创始人态度

**Tracy Aloway**: 几个月前，**Tracy**和我采访了**Perplexity CEO**，他谈到了**SPV**的兴起，以及他想拒绝资金。人们带着投资机会来找他，然后很明显他们只是想以某种方式打包股权，创造一种二级市场工具。我知道，最近有人给我发消息说：“我可以给你一些**Anthropic**的IPO前股票。”我说：“不，我不做那个。”但我知道很多人对此很感兴趣。你提到，如果你真的想在这个层面实现大规模增长，那么只有私有公司才能实现超大规模增长。跟我们谈谈**SPV**和这些第三方实体的出现，以及你甚至不知道谁在你的股东名册上，以及创始人是如何看待这种现象的。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: Part of the reason we wanted to have this conversation a few months ago, **Tracy** and I interviewed the **Perplexity CEO** and he was talking about the rise of **SPVS** and wanting to say no to money. People come to him with investment opportunities and then it's clear that they just want to package up that equity in some way and create a secondary instrument. And I know, someone messaged me recently and they're like, I could get you some preipo **Anthropic** shares. I'm like, no, I don't do that. But I know that there's a lot of interest in there. And you mentioned that if you really want massive growth at this level that it's the only ones that growing super big are the private companies. Talk to us about the emergence of **SPVS** and these third-party entities and you don't even know who's on your cap table and how founders are thinking about this phenomenon.

</details>

**David George**: 我认为大多数创始人真的不喜欢它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David George**: I think founders for the most part really don't like it.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: Okay.

</details>

**David George**: 因为他们想知道谁在他们的股东名册上，而且有些投资者会来找创始人，我认为他们会误报资金的来源或载体。就我们而言，我们不做那些。我们所做的是直接从我们的基金中投资。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David George**: Because they they want to know who is on their cap table and there are certain types of investors who will come to the founders and misrepresent I think what what vehicle or or where the capital is actually going to come from. In our case, we don't do those. What what we do is we invest directly out of our funds and

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 我们以此为荣，对创始人说：“嘿，你清楚地知道你得到了什么，我们会坦诚相待。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: you know we we make that a point of pride with the founders to say hey you know exactly what you're getting we're going to shoot you straight

</details>

**David George**: 对于**SPV**行业，当市场好的时候它运作良好，但当市场不好的时候它可能会非常糟糕。我们与我们的一家公司关系非常密切，我们是最大的投资者之一。他们曾与一些**SPV**推销员进行过著名的“战争”，这些推销员试图通过一些模糊的方式在他们不知情的情况下募集资金进行交易。他们说：“看，我们想确切地知道谁在我们的股东名册上。我们想确保我们对股东负责。”所以，这是一种冒险的策略。并不是说没有好的**SPV**，但我们尽量避免它。我们尽量建议我们的创始人尽可能远离它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David George**: for the **SPB** industry you know look it works when you know times are good and it can be horrendous and and bad you know when when times are bad you know and is one of our companies very close with we're one of the largest investors and they have famously you know gone to war with some of the **SPV** husters who are trying to assemble capital to do a deal through some obfuscated way around them and they say, "Look, we want to know exactly who's on our cap table. We want to make sure that we're doing right by our shareholders." And so, it's a risky maneuver. It's not to say that there's not some that that are good, but we try to avoid it. We try to counsel our founders to stay away from it as much as possible.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 你提到了**Andreessen Horowitz**，创始人能完全阻止他们吗？或者说，创始人是如何做到不让这些载体获得他们的股权，但它们却以某种方式做到了？这些实体进入公司的途径是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: So you mentioned **Anderoll** and can founders completely lock them out or like how does it work such that the founder doesn't want to have these vehicles get access to their equity and yet somehow they do anyway? What is the path into the company that these entities are taking?

</details>

**David George**: 举个例子，一个基金会找到创始人说：“是的，我们将从这个基金中投资。”他们有一个作为基金的法律实体名称。然后创始人并不完全清楚，那个法律实体实际上只是由一群新投资者组成的集合体，他们只投资于那个单一的载体。我想说，**SPV**的兴趣还伴随着另一种额外的风险。我们的主要投资者，我们的有限合伙人（LPs），他们是世界上一些最大的机构。他们信任我们进行投资，他们实际上喜欢他们投资的基金具有一定程度的多元化。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David George**: The example would be a fund shows up to the founder and says, "Yeah, we're going to invest out of this fund." And they have some legal entity name that they have as the fund. And then it's not fully clear to the founder that that legal entity actually will just be an assembly of a bunch of new investors that are only investing in that single vehicle. I would say the **SPV** interest, there's one other, sort of additional risk that comes with it. Our large investors, **RLPs**, they're some of the largest institutions in the world. They trust us to make investments and they actually like the fact that they're investing in a fund that has some degree of diversification.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: Yeah,

</details>

**David George**: **SPV**本质上是高风险的，因为它们是单一公司。所以，如果那家公司表现不佳，而你投资了**A16Z**的基金，你就可以继续战斗，因为我们还有许多其他公司会表现出色。在基金层面，回报会很好。但在**SPV**中，如果由于某种原因它没有成功，如果你投入了大量资本，那可能会是毁灭性的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David George**: **SPVS** are inherently risky because they're they're single company. And so, if that company happens to not go well and you invest in **A16Z**'s funds, you can live to fight another day because we have a number of other companies that are going to going to do really well. And at the fund level, the returns will be good. In an **SPV**, if that happens to not work for whatever reason, it could be devastating if if you put a large amount of capital into it.

### 私募市场估值与增长潜力

**Tracy Aloway**: 跟我们谈谈定价，因为你经常听到这样的说法：去私募市场有一些好处，但另一方面，你在资本成本方面可能要支付更多。你还会听到另一种说法：如果一切都是私有的，它不一定会像公开市场那样经常**按市值计价**，所以可能存在一些定价方面的担忧，你无法获得“群众智慧”效应，而只是一群科技兄弟投资科技兄弟，这可能会形成一种自我强化的循环。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: talk to us a little bit about pricing because something you tend to hear is that well if you go to the private market there are some benefits to that but on the other hand you're probably going to pay you know a little bit more in terms of cost of capital and then the other thing you hear is that well if everything is private it's not necessarily being marked to market as often as the public market so maybe there's some concern around pricing you're not getting that wisdom of the crowds effect you're just a bunch of tech bros investing in tech bros and that can kind of be a self-reinforcing cycle.

</details>

**David George**: 是的，看，我只能谈论我们自己的业务。我有两个观察。第一，我非常坚信，如果你把我们的投资组合放到公开市场，它的交易价格会高于私募市场。这说明了创始人正在做的资本成本权衡。这给我们带来了巨大的好处，因为我们能够投资于我们认为世界上最好的公司，而且比10年前更晚地进入它们的生命周期。一个有趣的数据点是。如果你看过去大约七年里，私募市场中通过良好IPO产生的历史回报，大约50%的IPO收益来自种子轮到B轮融资，然后50%的收益来自C轮及以后。随着公司私有化时间更长，这将大规模地转向C轮及以后，而种子轮到B轮将占收益的较小比例。同样，如果你回溯10年，看看所有上市的公司，这里有一点时间滞后，所以请耐心听我说。10年前上市的最好公司，其总回报的88%是在公开市场产生的。所以如果你只看总市值创造，只有12%发生在私募市场。如果你看过去5年最近一批IPO，它们55%的市值创造发生在私募市场。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David George**: Yeah, look, I I can only speak to our own business that we're in. I'd make two observations. One, I feel pretty strongly that if you took our portfolio and put it in the public markets, it would trade higher than the, than the private markets. And so that speaks to the, cost of capital trade-off that the founders are making. It's benefited us tremendously because we've been able to invest in companies that we think are some of the best companies in the world later into their life cycle than we would have been able to 10 years or so ago. interesting data point. If you look at the returns generated by dollars in the private markets historically over the last call it like seven years of good IPOs about 50% of the dollars of gain in an IPO come from the seed through series B and then 50% of the dollars of gain come from the series C and later. as companies have stayed private longer that will massively shift to the series C and later and the seed through B will be a smaller proportion of the dollars of gain similarly if you go back 10 years and you look at all the companies that have gone public there's a little bit of like time lag in this so just just bear with me so the best companies that were going public 10 years ago generated 88% of their overall dollars of return in the public markets so if you just took total market cap creation only 12% of it was happening in the private markets. If you look at the recent crop of IPOs in the last 5 years, 55% of their market cap creation happened in the private markets.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 哇。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Wow.

</details>

**David George**: 45%发生在公开市场。所以价值创造的地点发生了巨大的转变。这使我们受益。在定价方面，我们投资了一个由优秀公司组成的投资组合。我列举了一些我们的投资。我们最大的一些投资是像**DataBricks**、**SpaceX**、**Whimo**、**OpenAI**、**Stripe**和**Flock Safety**这样的公司。如果看我们的投资组合，平均增长率是100%。我们以21倍的营收倍数进行投资。现在，我承认营收倍数存在缺陷，但我想说，如果你能让我拥有一个完整的投资生涯，投资于市场领先的优秀科技公司，我们能以21倍营收倍数买入它们，而且它们增长100%。那将是一个不可思议的交易或投资机会。所以在估值方面，我觉得在私募市场存在折扣，创始人我想大部分都理解这一点并做出权衡。但这绝对是我们看到的动态。还有一件事我想指出。我之前提到，在公开市场中，我们所关注的上市公司中，只有三家公司的增长率超过30%。存在一种动态，我确实认为公开市场投资者甚至很难理解非常高的增长率。所以如果你增长60%。我认为公开市场投资者会自动建立一个财务模型，说60%、50%、20%。然后他们会根据这个来给你估值。然后他们会在第五年选择一个退出倍数，并将其应用于20%的增长率，他们可能会说，到那时你会有20%的利润率，他们会很高兴，然后就结束了，你的股价就是那个价格。而实际上，如果你是一家优秀的公司，比如**DataBricks**，它的增长率仍然超过60%。你的价值可能相差3到4倍，如果你增长60%、55%、52%、48%、45%。你的估值可能相差3到4倍。所以我确实认为像我们这样在私募市场拥有更长投资期限的人，可能更容易理解这种非常高的增长率。**DataBricks**增长65%。如果你看公开市场，**Palantir**是唯一一家增长如此之快的软件公司。我认为他们增长70%，他们与**DataBricks**的规模大致相同，他们的估值倍数是35倍左右。所以这是一个例子，公开市场投资者可能将非常高的估值归因于非常高的**超高速增长**。但大多数情况下，我认为他们很难理解这一点。所以，当我们与这些私募市场公司的创始人进行对话时，我认为我们理解它。我认为我们理解多产品策略，而且你不太可能找到一个完整的公开市场群体会为这种**超高速增长**买单。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David George**: 45% happened in the public markets. So there is a massive shift that's taken place in terms of where value creation happens. That's benefited us. In terms of pricing, we've invested in a portfolio of of great companies. I listed all the some of our investments. Some of our biggest investments are companies like **DataBricks** and **SpaceX** and **Whimo** and **OpenAI** and **Stripe** and **Flock Safety** and companies like that. If you take our portfolio on average it's growing 100%. And we invested at 21 times revenue. Now, I recognize there are flaws with revenue multiples and all that, but I would say if you could let me have a career, an entire career of investing in market leading great technology companies where we could buy them at 21 times revenue and they're growing 100%. That would be an incredible trade or a incredible investment opportunity. And so in terms of valuations, I feel like there is a discount to being in the private markets and founders I think understand that for the most part and make that trade-off. But it's definitely a dynamic that we see. There's one more thing that I would call out. I mentioned earlier that only three companies in our universe in the public markets are actually growing greater than 30%. There is a dynamic where I do think it's hard for public market investors even to gro really really high growth rates. So if you're growing like 60%. I think automatically a public market investor is going to build a financial model that says 60 50 20%. And then they're going to value you as such. And then they'll pick an exit multiple at year five and they'll apply it to 20% growth and they'll probably say at that point you'll be 20% margins and they'll be happy and they'll call it a day and they'll have your stock price be that when in reality, if you're a great company, like **DataBricks** that's still growing north of 60%. like you're worth probably 3 to 4x difference in value if you grow 60% 55% 52% 48% 45% like it's it's probably like a 3x or 4x difference in how you're valued and so I do think people like us with a longer time horizon in the private markets may have an easier time of actually groing that very high growth rate you know **DataBricks** is growing 65% if you look at the public markets really only **Palantir** is a software company that's growing that fast. I think they're growing 70%, they're about the same size as **DataBricks** and their valuation multiple is 35 times or something like that. And so that's the one example where maybe public market investors are attributing a really high valuation to very high kind of **hypergrowth**. But for the most part, I think it's pretty hard for them to gro that. And so again, when we have conversations with the founders of the these companies in the in the private markets, I think we understand it. I think we understand multi-product and you're less likely to find, a full public market of folks who will give you credit for that **hypergrowth**.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 我觉得这是一个非常有趣的观察。我的意思是，无论是公开还是私有，似乎几代人以前，你都会假设，好的，这是一家非常大的公司。它不会是世界上增长最快的公司之一。然后你就会应用那种模型思维，降低它们的增长预期。我的意思是，即使是**Alphabet**，我想它在最近一个季度的营收增长实际上比前一个季度还要快，比如同比。所以，撇开公开或私有不谈，确实感觉存在这样一种现象，即真正庞大的公司年复一年地以惊人的营收增长率增长，而投资者可能仍然没有充分认识到这一点。我有一个问题要问你。我一直想知道。好的，假设你的一家大型投资组合公司最终上市了，比如**Stripe**之类的。GP（普通合伙人）或者说公司是如何考虑在那时出售的？是不是说，你是一个私募市场投资者，所以你会很快退出，不想持有它？还是它们会被分发出去，然后由LP（有限合伙人）来考虑？一旦公司不再是私有的，出售的决定是怎样的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: I find this to be a very interesting observation. I mean, just generally public or private, it does seem like several generations ago, you assume, okay, here is a really big company. It's not going to be one of the fastest growing companies in the world. And you apply that sort of model mindset where you marked down their growth expectations. I mean, even **Alphabet**, I think in its latest quarter actually had faster topline growth than it had in the quarter before, like on a year-over-year basis. So, setting aside public or private, it does feel like there is just this phenomenon where really gigantic companies grow at shocking shocking topline rates year after year in a way that maybe even still investors might not appreciate. I have a question for you. Something I've always wondered. Okay, let's say one of your big portfolio companies goes public eventually, **Stripe** or something like that. How does a GP or how do how does the firm think about selling at that point? Is it okay, you're you're a private market investor, so you get out fairly soon, you don't want to hold that. Do they get distributed and then it's up to the LPs to think about it? What is the sell decision like once a company is no longer private?

</details>

**David George**: 是的，这是一个很好的问题。顺便说一句，关于这些大型高增长公司，这对我们所有人来说都是一个很好的学习，即最好的公司可以超越你的预期，即使它们很大也能快速增长。这就像是打破了公司绝对规模的定律。**Meta**上个季度营收增长加速到30%，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David George**: Yeah, it's a great question. And by the way, to your point on these large cap high growth companies, it's a really good learning for all of us that the very best companies can, sort of defy your expectations and still grow fast even though they're big. Like it's sort of the breaking of the law of the absolute size of a company. Like **Meta** accelerated revenue growth to 30% the last quarter,

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: right?

</details>

**David George**: 这很令人震惊，一家市值近2万亿美元的公司可以加速增长到30%。**Google**也一样，增长超过20%。所以如果你能找到这些机会，我会说**Stripe**就是一个很好的例子。上一代这样的公司可能是**Visa**和**Mastercard**。如果你有一个强烈的论点，认为它们会在15年内增长超过20%，你就会以一种非常不同的方式来估值，而不是认为这种增长会随着时间减弱。所以，是的，我认为你提到**Google**很好，我们考虑大型公司，试图了解最好的公司可能会发生什么，对我们私募市场的公司来说，不仅仅是五年，而是十年甚至更长时间。所以回到你关于分配或出售的问题，当我们的公司上市时，我们的LP（有限合伙人），我们的投资者倾向于获得分配，而不是我们出售。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David George**: Like that's shocking like that a company that's worth, almost $2 trillion can accelerate to 30% growth. Same with **Google**, north of 20% growth. So if you can find those opportunities, I would say **Stripe** is a good example of this. Previous generations of this would be like **Visa** and **Mastercard**. Like if you had a strong thesis that those would grow at north of 20% for 15 years, you would value it a very different way than if you thought that that growth would tail off over time. So yeah, I think it's great that you brought up **Google** and we think about the large cap companies to try and inform what could go right with the best of the best, the companies in the private markets for us too, not just over five years, but over 10 plus years. So to your question about distributions or selling, when our companies go public, our LPs, our investors tend to like to have distributions as opposed to us selling.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 好的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Okay?

</details>

**David George**: 很多LP都有自己的公开市场部门或运营，他们更愿意自己持有股票，管理税务后果，或者他们可能有一个长期持有的投资组合。所以我们倾向于分配公司。我想说，大多数情况下，当我们的公司上市时，我从增长基金的角度来说，我们是在公司更成熟的阶段进入的。公司上市并不意味着我们就会退出。我们总是寻求向LP返还资本，我们希望确保我们在适当的时间范围内这样做，但通常，我们会在公开市场中发现我们的公司被严重低估的情况。我给你举个例子。我们最好的一家公司是**Samsara**，它提供车队管理和司机视频追踪。他们是市场领导者，是第二次创业的创始人。他们是**Moroi**的创始人，**Moroi**后来卖给了**Cisco**。所以他们是一个非常优秀的团队，表现出色。他们在2021年底上市，当时IPO市场开始冻结，他们是最后一个IPO。所以我们最终成为他们IPO中最大的买家。所有公开基金，**Fidelity**、**T. Rowe Price**等一些基金都投资了，我们最终实际上是最大的买家，然后我们长期持有它，即使它已经在公开市场。所以我们喜欢思考，即使公司在公开市场，它的未来是什么，如果创始人仍然在管理公司，我们倾向于持有更长时间。我们非常重视创始人管理公司，我很乐意谈谈这一点。如果我们认为增长前景非常光明，我们就会倾向于长期持有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David George**: you know, many of them have public desks or public operations on their own and they would prefer to take the stock and, manage tax consequences on their own or or maybe they have, a long book that wants to hold it. And so, we tend to distribute companies. I would say for the most part when our companies go public, I'll speak from the growth fund, where we're coming in at a more mature stage of the company. Just because a company goes public doesn't mean that we will exit. Now, we always seek to return capital to our LPs and we want to make sure that we're doing that on appropriate time horizon, but often, we'll find situations in the public markets where we think our companies are are massively undervalued. I'll give you an example. One of our best companies was company called **Samsara**, which does fleet management, video tracking for drivers. They're the market leader, second time founders. They were the founders of **Moroi**, which sold to **Cisco**. So, they're an exceptional team, doing great. They went public right at the tail end of 2021 and the IPO market was starting to freeze and they were the last IPO and so we ended up being the largest buyer in their IPO. So all of the public funds **Fidelity** **T. Rowe Price** some of them invested we ended up actually being the biggest buyer and then we held that for a long period of time even though it was in the public markets. So we'd like to think about, what is the future of the company even if they're in the public markets and we would bias to hold it a little bit longer if the founders still running the company. We place a tremendous amount of value in founders running companies, which I'm happy to talk about. And if we think the the growth prospects are really bright, we'll we'll tend to sort of buy to hold a little bit longer.

### 上市的驱动因素

**Jill Weisenthal**: 那么上市的真正催化剂是什么呢？因为如果我们认为私募市场有充足的资本，员工对他们的薪酬普遍满意，人们可以接受资本成本。那么为什么要上市呢？或者说，就时机而言，最常见的原因是什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: What's the actual catalyst for going public then? Because if we think there's plenty of capital in the private markets, employees are, generally pretty happy with their compensation, people can live with the capital cost. Why would you go public or like what's the most common reason in terms of timing?

</details>

**David George**: 是的，最大的原因将是获得更大的资本池。你最终会觉得你正在进行权衡，公开市场的资本成本会更具吸引力，所以你想在那里进行。例如，在建设数据中心和太空领域，这将需要大量的资本。你可以在私募市场获得很多资本，但你可能在某个时候觉得利用公开市场来获得这些资本是有意义的。如果你有巨大的抱负，有时在公开市场更容易获得债务和替代形式的融资。最后，如果你觉得员工竞争非常激烈，而且我描述了季度**RSU**和股票货币的动态，这在公开市场可能更容易管理。那将是另一个原因。不仅仅是员工。如果你想进行有意义的并购，在公开市场中拥有公共货币可能会有一些好处，这样你就不必与卖家争论你的股权价值，因为它在公开市场中。每天都有股价。所以这些是其中一些动态。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David George**: Yeah, the biggest thing would be access to larger pools of capital and you finally feel like you're making that tradeoff where the cost of capital in the public markets would just be much more attractive and so you want to go do it there. So in the case of building for example data centers in space yeah that will require a tremendous amount of capital over time you know you can get a lot of that capital in the private markets and you know maybe at some point it makes sense to tap the public markets to get that you know if you have huge ambitions sometimes it's easier to get debt and alternative forms of financing in the public markets as well and then lastly you know if you feel like the competition is really fierce for your employees and you know I described that dynamic of you know quarterly **RSU** use and you know stock currency that might be a little bit easier to manage in the public markets. That would be another reason. It's not just employees. It's also if you want to do meaningful M&A, there's probably a little bit of a benefit to being in the public markets and having a public currency that you can use where, you don't have to debate with the sellers what the value of your equity is because it's in the public markets. There's a daily stock price. So, those are a few of the dynamics.

</details>

### AI对市场格局的影响

**Jill Weisenthal**: 私募市场的趋势会随着我们看到越来越多的科技都与**AI**相关而持续吗？如果我们知道**AI**需要大量的资本投资，那么这会改变私募和公开市场之间的动态或力量平衡吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Does the private market trend does that hold as we see more and more tech is just about **AI** right and if there's one thing we know about **AI** it's that it requires quite a lot of capital investment so does that start to change the dynamics or the balance of power between private and public in your mind.

</details>

**David George**: 这又回到了同一点，那就是在某个时候，所需的资本量可能意味着进入公开市场是有意义的。我认为对于大型消费业务来说，在公开市场中存在一些价值，让散户参与你股票的所有权，拥有更大的品牌认知度。我们最近在B2B方面也看到了这一点，我们的一家上市公司在上市后，有时会获得一种品牌效益，一种品牌光环，你更广为人知，IT买家对你的未来会更信任一点。所以存在一些这样的动态。**AI**首先，我认为这些有潜力成为有史以来最好的企业。它们由杰出的创始人运营，正在构建以我们前所未有的速度增长的产品。所以它们正在以一种方式加速公司增长的过程，比上一代公司更快地变得更大、更重要。所以，也许这意味着它们也应该更快地进入公开市场。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David George**: It goes back to the same point which is at some point the amount of capital required it probably makes sense to be in the public markets. I do think for large scale consumer businesses I think there's some value in being in the public markets letting retail take part in the ownership of your stock having greater brand recognition we we saw this recently on the B2B side as well with one of our public companies and after going public sometimes there's sort of a brand benefit that you get brand halo you're better known you know an IT buyer trusts a little bit more in your future so there are some of those dynamics that exist **AI** first of all I think these have the potential to be some of the best businesses ever created they're run by exceptional founders they're building products that have grown at rates that we've never ever seen before so you know they're kind of speed running the process of company growth in a way getting to be bigger and more consequential much much faster than the previous generation of companies. So, maybe that means they should be in the public markets a little bit faster, too.

</details>

**Tracy Aloway**: 也许去年某个时候，**OpenAI**进行了一次大规模的**要约收购**，然后旧金山突然没有人能买得起房子了，因为所有的钱都流向了房地产。但实际上有一个严肃的问题，这在**AI**公司中尤为突出。员工出售部分股份会有任何耻辱感吗？比如，你可以出售25%的股份，然后有人说：“我想卖。”这就像是：“什么？你不相信奇点吗？你不相信我们正在走向**AGI**吗？你不认为我们已经完成了任务，我们的价值不会是10倍吗？”对于一家真正有使命感、快速增长的公司的员工来说，会有这种焦虑吗？比如：“我想试试水。我想对冲一下。我想分散我的公司风险。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: Maybe last year at some point, **OpenAI** had a big tender and then suddenly no one could afford to buy a house again in San Francisco because all that money went into real estate. But I there's a serious question actually and it's particularly acute at the **AI** companies. Is there any stigma of being an employee who sells some of their shares? It's like, all right, you can sell 25% of your shares and then it's like, I want to sell. It's like what? You don't believe in the singularity? You don't believe that we're on the path to **AGI**. You don't think you think we're done with our you think we're almost at the end of our mission and that our value won't be 10. Is that like is there any anxiety on the part of employees at a real like mission driven fast growth company of like I want to dip my toe in the water. I want to hedge a little bit. I want to hedge my own company. I want to diversify away from my own company.

**David George**: 我认为凡事适度。大多数时候，没有这种耻辱感，大多数时候，这也不是一个出售大量股票的机会，以至于会成为一种“缺乏信心”的投票，对吧？如果你出售了25%已归属的股票，并且你已经在那里工作了两年，这意味着你可能还有大量的未归属股票。所以你谈论的是你总持股的一小部分，对吧？我们从未真正看到员工有机会，它从未被设计成那种员工会说：“天哪，我退出了。我想出售我100%的股票。”事实上，我们没有这方面的数据，但我怀疑在公开市场中，员工出售股票奖励的速度可能比私募市场更快。

**David George**: I think everything in moderation. Most of the time there's not like a stigma and most of the time it's not, an opportunity to sell so much stock that it would be a vote of lack of confidence, if you will, right? You know, if it's 25% of your vested stock and you've been there for two years, that means you probably have a ton of unvested stock. And so, you're talking about a small proportion of your overall holdings, right? We never really see a chance for employees to it's never designed that way where employees say, "Oh my gosh, I'm out. I want to sell 100% of my stock." In fact, we don't have data on this, but I would suspect that in the public markets, employees are probably selling out of their stock grants at a higher rate than in the private markets.

**David George**: 我认为，如果你是私募市场中的这些公司之一的员工，你可能会有更大的信心。如果你是一个好员工，你总是可以去**Google**、**Facebook**或**Meta**“剪息票”。但我认为大多数时候，优秀的员工都是真正的信徒。我们确实有一些公司，创始人——我最喜欢的一件事是，当创始人说：“我一股都不卖。”你知道，这就像是信心的终极体现。我们曾与上一代一位非常知名的互联网公司CEO共度时光。他现在是一家上市公司。在一次会议中，我们和他谈论二级市场，他非常坚决。他说：“我一股都不卖。我为什么要卖一股呢？我非常有信心它会涨，我根本不想那样做。”这是一个非常强烈的信号，表明他对公司未来的信心。所以，我们在投资时会寻找一些这样的信号。我的合伙人**Alex Rmpelle**多年前写过一篇很好的文章，关于你提到的房地产和买房以及负担能力。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David George**: And I think, if you're if you're at one of these companies in the private markets, you probably have a greater degree of confidence. If you're a good employee, you could you could always go to **Google** or **Facebook** or **Meta** and and clip coupons. But I think that most of the time the good ones are true believers. We do have companies where the founders my one of my favorite things is when the founders just say I'm not selling a share. And you know that is like the ultimate extreme point of confidence. We spent time with a very high-profile internet CEO of the previous generation. It's now a public company. And one of the meetings we were talking to him about secondary and he was so resolute. He was like I'm not selling a share. Like why would I sell a single share? like I I'm so confident it's going to go up, I don't want to do that at all. And that's a pretty strong signal of confidence in the future of the company. So, we look for some of those signals when we invest. My partner **Alex Rmpelle** wrote a good piece many years ago to your point on real estate and buying a house and affordability.

**Jill Weisenthal**: 是的。那篇文章展示了湾区股票价格，**巨头股**与房价指数完美相关。

### AI投资与非模型公司未来

**Tracy Aloway**: 是的，我认为公平地说，现在旧金山有很多人对通过**AI**赚钱感到兴奋，其中一些人已经做到了。但说到这里，你们是如何区分**AI**模型的？我想这是一种问法，你们是如何识破炒作的？因为我们看到所有这些新公司都在推出。它们很多都使用相似的语言。现在**总可寻址市场**（**TAM**）这个词被大量使用。你们如何判断这实际上是一个好的商业模式，而不是一个仅仅名字里有**AI**并获得了一些关注的东西？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: Yeah, I think it's fair to say there are a lot of people in San Francisco right now who are excited about making money off of **AI** and some of them have been doing so already. But on that note, how are you actually differentiating between **AI** models? I guess like this is a way of asking how are you cutting through the hype because we see all these new companies launching. A lot of them use similar language. We see **Total Available Market** (**TAM**) being thrown around quite a lot nowadays. How do you decide this is actually like a good business model versus this is just something that has **AI** in the name and is getting some attention?

</details>

**David George**: 是的，我们是**AI**行业最大的投资者之一。我认为我们投资了**AI**总收入的三分之二。所以，如果你把私募市场中所有**AI**公司的收入加起来，我们投资了大约三分之二。所以，我认为我们对此有第一手的了解。首先，我从需求侧开始。这是我们关注的最大问题。有超过10亿人正在使用这项技术，并从中获得巨大的**盈余**或价值。这些公司是我们见过的增长最快的公司。活跃用户每天花大约30分钟使用它。即使你作为订阅者付费，它也带来了巨大的**盈余**。所以在消费侧，我认为能力非常强大。它们非常非常好。我们现在才刚刚开始触及**AI**替你完成工作的能力表面。所以我认为在未来一年里，我们会在这个方面看到巨大的进步。但我们看到的需求信号，它们无疑是我职业生涯中见过的最好的。当然比互联网时代、移动社交、云计算、**SaaS**、电子商务等任何一个时代都要快得多。所以在需求侧有巨大的价值。这是我们关注的最大问题。在供应侧，关于所需基础设施的建设有很多文章。它比美国高速公路系统整体还要大。未来五到七年将投入5万亿美元。关于供应侧，我想说的是，我们今天作为一个行业，不需要决定投资所有这些资金。行业可以监测需求，我们可以随着情况调整资本支出决策。周期时间不是五年那么长。周期时间更像是12个月。所以如果我们看到需求减弱，或者一些基础设施建设缺乏回报，那么，那没关系。我们可以调整方向。我认为人们可能对这些公司的负责人存在误解。在所有这些的中心，像我们和他们一样，都是注重**投资回报率**（**ROIC**）的人。如果我们认为不会有高回报，我们就不会投资大量资本。所以，如果存在一些过度建设，或者需求不足以满足供应的迹象，我认为行业会进行调整。我们以前也写过这方面的内容。如果你将这次建设与光纤建设进行对比，到目前为止，如果你将一个**GPU**或**TPU**上线，它会立即被使用。这甚至适用于非常老的**GPU**和**TPU**。**Google**已经披露了他们10年前的**TPU**。你可以很容易地在市场上找到两代前**GPU**的定价。而且这些价格都保持不变。所以没有“暗**GPU**”。没有人正在建设的数据中心不是一上线就被充分利用的。相比之下，互联网建设的特点是“暗光纤”。所以，你必须先打下所有这些基础，然后才能看到任何需求迹象。所以，显然，供需之间存在不匹配。所以，这就是对供需动态的总体看法。我非常非常乐观。我认为我们正处于探索如何在这项技术之上构建真正有趣应用的早期阶段。就模型能力而言，模型正在以惊人的速度改进。它们基本上可以在六到七个月内将其完成长篇任务的能力翻倍。所以，如果你今天停止模型开发，我认为我们仍然有机会在未来10到20年内构建真正有趣的应用。今年到目前为止，公开市场发生的大事是非**AI**公司和各种传统软件公司的彻底屠杀。你如何看待那些不拥有模型，可能需要从其他公司购买智能的公司？在你看来，当你在考虑私有或公开公司时，哪些不是**AI**实验室的业务能够生存下来，哪些如果它们不拥有原始智能就无法生存？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**David George**: Yeah. So, we're I we're investors in we're probably the largest investor in the **AI** industry as a firm. I think we're investors in two-thirds of the aggregate **AI** revenue. So, if you were to just sum together all of the **AI** revenue of the companies in the private markets, we're investors in about two-thirds of it. So, I think we have a front row seat to it. First of all, I'll just start with the demand side. This is the biggest thing that we look to. There's a billion people plus using this technology getting extremely large surplus or value out of it. The companies are the fastest growing that we've ever seen. Active users spend something like 30 minutes a day on it. And there's a tremendous amount of surplus that comes with that even if you're paying as a subscriber for those. So on the consumer side, I think the capabilities are extreme. They're very, very good. We're just now starting to scratch the surface on the capabilities of, sort of doing work on your behalf. And so I think we're going to see a ton of progress on that front over the next year. But the demand signals that we see are probably not probably, they are definitively the best that we've ever seen in my career. Certainly much faster than, the internet phase or mobile social, cloud, **SAS**, e-commerce, any of those. So tremendous amount of value on the demand side. That's the biggest thing we look for. On the supply side, look, the buildout there's there's there's a ton written about the buildout of infrastructure that's required. It's, it's larger than, the US highway system overall. $5 trillion over the next five to seven years. The thing that I say about the supply side is we don't need to make the decision on investing every single one of those dollars as an industry today. The industry can monitor demand and we can make decisions about **capex** as we go. Cycle times are not five years long. Cycle times are more like 12 months. And so if we see a weakening of demand or a lack of payback in some of this infrastructure buildout, then that's fine. We can we can adjust course the people who are I think there's probably a misconception about the people who are in charge of these these companies and at the center of all this like us like we and they are all sort of **ROIC** or **return on capital-minded** people like we're not going to invest a bunch of capital if we think there's not going to be a high return from it so to the extent that there is some overbuild or signs of a lack of demand to meet the supply I think the industry will adjust we've written about this before. If you contrast this buildout with the fiber buildout, so far, if you put a **GPU** or a **TPU** online, it immediately gets used. And and this holds for actually very old **GPUs** and **TPUs**. **Google**'s disclosed this about their **TPUs** that are 10 years old. You can pretty easily find pricing of two generations ago **GPUs** on the market. And the price of these have all held. So, there are no **dark GPUs**. No one is building data centers that aren't being fully utilized right out of the gate. You know, contrast that with the internet buildout. The internet buildout was characterized by **dark fiber**. And so, you had to lay all this groundwork before you actually had any signs of demand. And so, obviously, there was there was a mismatch in supply and demand. So, that's the sort of overall kind of view on supply demand dynamics. I'm very very optimistic. I think we're in the early days of figuring out really interesting applications to build on top of this technology. And in terms of model capabilities, models are improving at a like eye popping rate. They can basically double their ability to complete long form tasks over six to seven months. And so if you were to just arrest model development today I think we would have the chance to build 10 to 20 years of really interesting applications on top of it. The big thing that happened in public markets so far this year is the absolute slaughtering of sort of non-**AI** companies and legacy software companies of various sorts and so forth. How are you thinking about companies that don't own a model that maybe have to buy intelligence from another company or so forth? Who in your view when you're thinking about private or public companies, who that's not an **AI** lab, what types of businesses survive and which ones are not going to survive if they don't own intelligence in the raw.

</details>

**David George**: 是的。我将涵盖这两个话题，因为我对软件市场正在发生的事情有非常强烈的看法，然后我们可以谈谈不拥有模型的公司的未来。关于后一点，我们可以先谈谈。看，公司购买的是解决方案，对吧？所以，**上下文**仍然是王道。在大多数行业中，会有公司积累其行业特定工作流程和行业特定数据的知识。所以，通常这不会是模型公司选择追求的。客户购买的是解决方案，他们不购买某个离散的工作流程，或者仅仅是一个数据库，或者一个采取行动的系统。所以，最重要的就是**行业上下文**。你还需要一个“可以扼住的喉咙”，对吧？我认为这对于客户来说会越来越重要。所以，支持、维护、集成、数据合作、用户社区，我认为这些对于那些正在构建应用程序但不是模型所有者的公司来说都很重要。我认为在大多数垂直领域和组织中的许多职能部门，都会有独立的第三方公司来做这些。模型公司将成为大多数行业的“**军火商**”，提供高度横向或通用的任务或工作。所以像企业内部的**通用知识管理**，模型公司可能在这方面定位很好。但像法律工作、医疗工作、客户支持任务，销售、会计、财务中会发生很多事情，我认为这些将是独立的供应商，而模型公司将成为它们的“**军火商**”。所以我认为这就是不拥有模型的应用程序公司的未来。我认为这是一个非常光明的未来。我们对其中一些领先公司进行了大量投资，但我认为模型公司和这些公司都将在软件领域取得巨大成功。是的。我的意思是，看，软件行业在公开市场中受到了重创。我们可以争论这是否被夸大了，但我要给你我对这种情况的诊断，不是特别针对特定公司的估值，而是公开市场软件公司将会发生什么。我认为问题不在于未来会有大量新软件。未来会有大量新软件。**SaaS**和云计算的整个故事是市场规模增长了7倍，其中一部分被现有企业占据，一部分被初创公司占据。问题是，公开市场中的现有企业是否会真正抓住这个机会？顺便说一句，我认为这次的规模会比7倍大得多。那么为什么这是一个问题，这些现有企业是否有机会做到这一点？首先，它们可能更难增长，对吧？现在，任何买方组织的所有新预算基本上都流向了**AI**计划。这并不意味着它们会淘汰现有的软件系统。这些现有软件系统的**总美元留存率**仍然非常高，我认为会持续一段时间。但如果你看2021年以来，这些公司的**净美元留存率**一直在稳步下降。如果你看整个软件行业在2026年将增加的收入，仅**OpenAI**和**Anthropic**两家公司将增加的收入就将超过整个软件市场增加的总收入。这包括**SAP**、**Intuit**、**Salesforce**、**Workday**、**ServiceNow**所有这些供应商。所以增长实际上正流向**AI**计划。所以，是的，那些现有供应商可能不会被淘汰，但它们将更难找到增长。所以，从产品角度来看，它们不会被撕裂，但它们确实面临着价值在它们之上被构建的风险。所以那些将成为**记录系统**，但你只需构建新的供应商，构建新的产品，可以在它们之上采取行动。我认为这对于软件行业来说是一个真正的风险。如果构建软件的过程变得更快。还有另一种动态，每个供应商基本上都可以迅速、大规模地增加他们提供的**SKU**数量。所以如果你是一个首选的平台供应商，并且在这个领域销售大量软件，那么附近领域的所有公司也很可能会有这些产品，它们都会尝试销售这些新产品，竞争会变得更加激烈。所以我认为这对于它们来说是一个真正的风险。我认为将发生的最强大的变化，我们现在只看到早期信号，是**商业模式转变**。所以当这些技术转变发生时，新的用户界面、新的工作流程、你访问的新数据，这些都偏向于新进入者，而不是现有企业。当你将其与**商业模式转变**结合起来时，那将极大地偏向于新进入者，对吧？因为如果你是现有企业，很难做出反应。所以如果你看商业模式的整个光谱，我们过去销售许可维护软件，我们将其转变为基于座位的订阅模式，然后随着云计算的出现，许多公司变成了基于消费的定价模式，而在未来，随着**AI**的出现，在许多领域，它将是**基于结果的定价**。你可以在客户支持行业首先看到这一点，因为那些公司必须完成可验证的任务。但如果我们真的达到企业主要通过结果购买并能够衡量这些结果的程度，我认为这对现有企业来说将非常艰难。

<summary>Original English</summary>

**David George**: Yeah. So I I will cover both of these topics because I have pretty strong views on what's happening in the software market and then we can talk about what's what the sort of future of companies that don't own a model is. On the latter point, we we can cover that one first. Look, companies buy solutions, right? And so, **context** is still king. In most industries, there will be companies that compound their knowledge of industry specific workflows, industry specific data that they attach to. And so, oftentimes that won't be what the model companies choose to pursue. Customers buy solutions, they they don't buy some discrete workflow or just a database or a system to take action. So, the most important thing is **industry context**. You also need a **throat to choke**, right? I think that's going to be increasingly important for customers. So support, maintenance, integrations, data partnerships, user community, I think are all important things for companies that are building applications that are not model owners. And I think in most verticals and many of the functions in an organization, there will be independent companies that do that. Model companies are going to be an **arms dealer** to most industries for some tasks or work that are highly horizontal or general. So something like **general knowledge management** inside of a corporation, the model companies are probably pretty well positioned for that. But things like legal work, medical work, customer support tasks, a lot of stuff that will happen in in sales, accounting, finance, like those I think those are going to be independent vendors and the model companies are going to be **arms dealers** to those. So that I think is the future of applications for companies that do not own models. I think it's a very bright future. We we've invested a lot in some of these leading companies, but I think both the model companies and those companies will be big and successful on the software side. Yeah. I mean, look, the the the software industry has been crushed in the public markets. We could debate whether it's overblown or not, but I'll give you my diagnosis of the situation, not not particularly on valuations of specific companies, but here's what's going to happen with the software companies in the public markets. I think the issue is not that there's going to be a ton of new software in the future. There is going to be a ton of new software in the future. The whole story of **SAS** and cloud was that the market grew 7x in size and some of that was captured by incumbents. Some of it was captured by startups. The issue is are the incumbents that are in the public markets going to actually be the ones that capture that? And by the way, I think it'll be much bigger than 7x this time. So why is it, sort of a question of whether those incumbents have the chance to do it? First of all, it's probably going to be much harder for them to grow, right? All the new budget basically in any buyer organization is going toward **AI** initiatives right now. Now, it doesn't mean that they're ripping out their software systems. **Gross dollar retention** remains extremely high for these incumbent software systems, and I think it will for a while. But if you look since 2021, **net dollar retention** of these companies has steadily declined. If you look at the amount of revenue that the entire software industry is adding in 2026, the amount of revenue that **OpenAI** and **Anthropic** alone will add is going to be greater than the amount of the total revenue added by all of the software market. like that's **SAP** **Intuit**, **Salesforce**, **Workday**, **ServiceNow**, all those vendors. So the growth is actually going toward **AI** initiatives. And so, yes, they may not be getting ripped out, those incumbent vendors, but it's going to be much harder for them to find growth. So, from a product standpoint, they're not going to get torn out, but they really run the risk of value getting built on top of them. So those are going to be **systems of record**, but you just build new vendors, build new products that can take action on top of those. And I think that's a real risk for the software industry right now. If building software, the process of building software becomes much faster. There's another dynamic where every vendor can basically increase the amount of **SKUs** they offer rapidly, massively. And so if you are a platform vendor of choice and you sell a bunch of software in this domain, chances are everyone in the in the nearby domains will also have those products and they'll all try to sell those new products and it'll get more competitive. So I think that's a dynamic that's that's really a risk for them. The most powerful change that I think is going to happen which we're only seeing early signals of is a **business model shift**. So when these technology shifts happen, a new user interface, new workflows, new data that you access, that favors, newcomers, over incumbents, when you pair it with a **business model shift**, that massively favors the newcomers, right? Because it's so hard to react if you're one of the incumbents. And so the big shift if you if you just take a spectrum of business models that's happened we used to sell license maintenance software we moved that to seat based subscription then with the clouds a lot of companies have become consumption based pricing models and in the future with **AI** and a lot of domains it's going to be **outcome based pricing** you can see this first in the customer support industry because there's sort of verifiable tasks that those companies have to complete but to the extent that we actually get to the point where the predominant way that that enterprises want to buy is via outcomes and they can measure those results. I think it's going to be really tough for the incumbent.

**Tracy Aloway**: 我记得**史蒂夫·鲍尔默**多年前说过，当时他谈到为什么**Linux**不会成功，因为他说：“不，当你的**Linux**崩溃时，你会对谁生气？”尽管后来公司确实，**Red Hat**发展起来，提供了专业的服务。我觉得**基于结果的定价**这个想法非常有趣，但有些数字也令人震惊，比如它的规模有多大。我曾经想过这个问题，当人们看公开市场时，他们会说：“是的，它没有被高估，因为大多数上市公司都在赚很多钱。”如果你建立一个包含大型私有和公开公司的指数，你会发现很多市值都来自尚未盈利的公司，这会极大地扭曲你对科技公司总估值的看法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Tracy Aloway**: I remember **Steve Balmer** said that years ago when he was talking about why **Linux** wouldn't take off cuz he's like, "No, what are you going to just like who are you going to get upset when your **Linux** goes down?" Although then companies did, **Redhead** grew up to like professionally service. I thought that was very interesting the idea of like **outcome based pricing** but just also some of the numbers are staggering just like how big you know this is I've thought about this with like um when people look at the public markets and they say well yeah it's not that overvalued because you know most of the public companies are making a lot of money if you were to sort of like build one index of big private and public companies you would have a lot of market cap on companies that aren't making money yet and that would very much like sort skew your view of the sort of like total valuation of the universe of tech companies.

</details>

**Jill Weisenthal**: 绝对如此。嗯，我还在想的另一件事就是那个问题，即私募和公开市场之间的平衡是否会开始逆转，因为现在大部分的兴奋点都在**AI**上，而**AI**需要投入数十亿美元，需要巨大的资本池。我想对此的反驳是，私募市场存在一种自我强化的趋势，那就是如果所有的增长都在那里，如果人们都在那里赚钱，它就会吸引更多的资本。所以我不知道，也许**AI**意味着私募资本会增长更多，所以**AI**可以继续利用它。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Jill Weisenthal**: Absolutely. Well, the other thing I was thinking is just that question of whether or not that kind of the balance between private and public starts to reverse because so much of the excitement right now is about **AI** which you know is spending billions and billions and needs huge pools of capital. I guess the counterpoint to that is like there's a self-reinforcing trend in the private market which is like if that's where all the growth is, if that's where people are making all the money, it tends to attract even more capital. So I don't know, maybe maybe **AI** means that private capital grows even more and so **AI** can keep tapping it.
