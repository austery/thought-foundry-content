### 引言：挑战不可能的特技

这是我，即将完成电影史上最危险的特技之一：在起飞的C-130（C-130: 一种军用运输机）飞机侧面悬挂。没有护目镜，没有头盔，也没有降落伞。这个特技在地球上只由另一个人完成过——汤姆·克鲁斯。（笑声）所以，我想说，这可能是第一次有“凡人”尝试这个特技。我叫Michelle Khare，我在YouTube上创建了一个名为“挑战接受”（Challenge Accepted: 指进行危险特技表演的人）的节目，在那里我尝试世界上最艰难的特技和职业。

<p class="english-text">This is me
about to perform one
of the most dangerous stunts
in cinematic history:
hanging on the side of a C-130
as it's taking off.
No goggles,
no helmet,
no parachute.
This stunt has only ever been performed
by one other person on the planet.
Tom Cruise.
(Laughter)
So I think it's fair to say
that this is the first time
this stunt has ever been attempted
by a mere mortal.
My name is Michelle Khare,
and I created a show on YouTube
called "Challenge Accepted,"
where I attempt the world's
toughest stunts and professions.</p>

### 从恐惧到勇气的转变

尽管我的工作头衔如此，但我并非天生的冒险家。我出生在一个移民家庭，我的父母牺牲了一切，为我换来一个安全、稳定且有机会成功的未来。他们为了我的存在付出了太多。那么，我为什么要冒险去毁掉这一切呢？所以，在我成长的过程中，我只把恐惧视为一个停止的标志。七年级时，我就是那个在别人受伤后就退出啦啦队的孩子。高中时，我最大的叛逆就是选择在国际科学与工程展（International Science and Engineering Fair: 面向中学生举办的科学竞赛）上使用Gill Sans（Gill Sans: 一种无衬线字体）字体，而不是Times New Roman（Times New Roman: 一种衬线字体）。（笑声）

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But despite my job title,
I was not born a daredevil.
I was born a child of immigrants
who sacrificed everything
to give me a safe,
secure, and a chance at a successful life.
They gave up so much for me just to exist.
So why would I ever risk that?
So growing up,
I only saw fear as a stop sign.
In seventh grade,
I was the kid who quit the cheer team
when someone else got hurt.
And my biggest rebellion in high school
was choosing to use the font Gill Sans
instead of Times New Roman
at the International Science
and Engineering Fair.
(Laughter)</p>

### “业余心态”的力量

这种思维模式无疑为我铺就了成功的道路，但它也在成年后让我感到无比孤独。于是，我决定承担我的第一个重大风险，报名参加了一个与我的职业完全无关的活动：一个自行车俱乐部。我当时非常糟糕。但我坚持了下来，因为我得到了我从未有过的东西：在没有后果的情况下失败的自由。现在，我们的大多数学习旅程看起来都像这样。起初，学习新事物真的、真的很有趣。我们的大脑会因为任何一点进步而释放多巴胺（Dopamine: 一种与愉悦和奖励相关的神经递质）。有些人称之为“初学者运气”（Beginner's luck: 指初学者的好运气），但我认为远不止于此。在快速适应阶段，业余爱好者（Amateur's mindset: 指一种乐于学习、敢于提问、勇于尝试且不怕犯错的心态）往往比专业人士进步更快。我们愿意提问，愿意显得笨拙地尝试，愿意冒险。所以，这不是运气。我认为这是一种“业余心态”。知道只有进步的空间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And while this mindset
definitely set me up for success,
it also left me
incredibly lonely as an adult.
So I decided to take my first big risk
and sign up for something
that had absolutely nothing
to do with my career:
a cycling club.
And I was terrible.
But I kept coming back
because I had something
I had never had before:
the freedom to fail without consequence.
Now most of our learning journeys
look something like this.
In the beginning, learning
something new is really, really fun.
And our brain floods with dopamine
at any sign of progress.
Some people call this beginner's luck,
but I think it's much more than that.
Amateurs often see progress
faster than professionals
in this rapid adaptation phase.
We have the willingness to ask questions,
to look silly trying, to take risks.
So it's not luck.
I think it's an amateur's mindset.
Knowing there's only room for improvement.</p>
</details>

### 骑行全国赛的意外胜利

这种情况感觉很棒，直到我们遇到瓶颈（Plateau: 指进步停滞的时期）。学习开始变得像工作一样，我们有了一点经验，于是开始在尝试时自我评判，许多人就在这里放弃了。但如果我们能找到一种方法来保持那种“业余心态”，我们能走多远呢？在骑行方面，我不知何故找到了一种方法，即使在我进步的同时也能保持那种心态。快进两年后，我一时兴起决定参加全国比赛，纯粹是为了好玩，当时我只是一个排名普通的赛车手。在最后一场比赛中，我决定冒险，冲到队伍前面。但因为没有人把我视为威胁，他们认为我会精疲力尽然后掉队。然而，20分钟后，令所有人（包括我自己）惊讶的是，我竟然赢了。（笑声）那是我第一次真正享受乐趣并取得成功或赢得比赛。于是我对自己说：我因为恐惧而错过了生命中的多少东西？一个冒险家是可以培养出来的吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And this feels great
until we hit a plateau.
Learning starts to feel like work,
we have a little bit of experience,
so we start self-judging as we try,
and many of us give up here.
But if we could find a way
to stay in that amateur's mindset,
how much further could we go?
With cycling, I had somehow found a way
to stay in that headspace
even as I got better.
And if you fast forward two years later,
I decided to go to nationals
on a whim for fun
as an average-ranked racer.
During the final event,
I decided to take a big risk
and sprint ahead of the group.
But because nobody was threatened by me,
they assumed I would burn out
and fall back in with everyone else.
But 20 minutes later,
to everyone's surprise, including my own,
I ended up winning.
(Laughter)
And it was the first time
I had seen success
or won something
by genuinely just having fun.
So I thought to myself:
How much of life had I been
missing out on because of fear?
Could a daredevil be developed?</p>
</details>

### 制定计划，直面恐惧

于是，我在白板上写下了我所有的恐惧，并将每一种恐惧与一个能迫使我面对它的独特情境联系起来。我开始在网上发布我的冒险经历，以此来约束自己。为了克服我害怕被视为不聪明的恐惧，我与国际象棋大师（Chess masters）一起学习，直到我的ELO（ELO: 一种用于国际象棋等双人游戏的评分系统）达到1000。这花了10个月。为了克服我害怕对抗的恐惧，我与一位奥运选手一起训练，在12000名尖叫的观众面前进行拳击比赛。我打破了牙齿，打断了鼻子，但我赢得了比赛。（笑声）为了克服我害怕被视为不好笑的恐惧，我加入了一个专业的滑稽演员团体。说实话，没有什么比站在一群陌生人面前，试图让他们发笑，同时还要以这种形象示人更可怕的了。（笑声）

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So I wrote out all of my fears
on a whiteboard
and connected each
to a unique circumstance
that would force me to address it.
I started posting my adventures online
as a way to hold myself accountable.
To face my fear of being perceived
as unintelligent,
I studied with chess masters
until I hit 1,000 ELO.
It took me 10 months.
To face my fear of confrontation,
I trained with an Olympian
to box in front of 12,000 screaming fans.
I bloodied my teeth, I broke my nose,
but I won the match.
(Laughter)
And to face my fear
of being perceived as unfunny,
I joined a professional clowning troupe.
And, I'll be honest,
there's nothing scarier than standing
in front of a group of strangers
trying to make them laugh
while looking like this.
(Laughter)</p>

### 恐惧是信息，而非终点

人们对此反响热烈。我的节目已经获得了8.5亿次的观看量。恐惧的存在是有充分理由的。它保护我们免受危险。有时恐惧意味着，“嘿，如果你做了这件事，你会死。”但很多时候我发现，我们把这一点做得太过了。恐惧并不总是意味着停止。有时它意味着前进。举个例子。几年前，我迷上了哈里·胡迪尼（Harry Houdini）和他最致命的魔术：“水刑”（Water torture cell: 哈里·胡迪尼表演过的著名逃脱术）。胡迪尼被锁链捆绑，倒立在一个装满水的玻璃箱里，仅凭一口气就能逃脱。一个人怎么能如此勇敢？于是，我的使命变成了尝试这个表演，直面我溺水的恐惧。普通人屏住呼吸的时间是30到60秒。但为了这个特技，我需要屏住呼吸三分钟。这听起来可能很疯狂，但在正确的训练和监督下是可能的。但要达到这一点，你必须穿过挣扎的阶段。这是当二氧化碳（Carbon dioxide: 呼吸产生的气体）在你的血液中积聚时，你的大脑会认为你正在窒息，并向你的膈肌（Diaphragm: 位于胸腔底部、帮助呼吸的圆顶状肌肉）发送信号，引起剧烈收缩，迫使你呼吸。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And people really responded.
The show has amassed 850 million views.
Now fear exists for a good reason.
It's to protect us from danger.
Sometimes fear means,
hey, if you do this, you will die.
But oftentimes I have found
we take that way too far.
Fear doesn't always mean stop.
Sometimes it means go.
Here's an example.
A couple of years ago,
I became obsessed with Harry Houdini
and his deadliest trick:
the water torture cell.
Bound in chains,
locked upside down in a glass box
filled to the brim with water,
Houdini would escape with a single breath.
How could anyone be this brave?
So it became my mission
to attempt this act,
to confront my fear of drowning.
Now the average person can hold
their breath for 30 to 60 seconds.
But for this stunt,
I needed a breath hold of three minutes.
It may sound crazy,
but under the right
training and supervision
it is possible.
But to get there,
you have to push
through the struggle phase.
This is when, as carbon dioxide
builds in your bloodstream,
your brain thinks you're suffocating
and sends signals to your diaphragm
to cause violent contractions
to force you to breathe.</p>
</details>

### 拥抱失败，突破极限

几周来，我都在这个边缘挣扎，我的屏息时间越来越短。直到我的教练告诉我：“嘿，你不能硬撑。你必须学会臣服。”当我最终臣服于痛苦时，我开始注意到以前从未注意到的所有细节。我注意到我在发抖，这意味着我正在燃烧宝贵的氧气来取暖。我的潜水服感觉有点太紧了，所以在下水前我实际上无法完全吸气。我开始注意到所有这些细微的变化，我们开始做出并解决它们，这带来了巨大的不同。当恐惧剥离了情感成分，它就仅仅是信息。它告诉我们确切的进步所需的一切。当我们解决了所有这些问题后，一切都改变了。六周后，我在两分四十秒内完成了胡迪尼的魔术。（掌声和欢呼声）

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now for weeks I failed at this edge,
and my breath hold times
were progressively getting worse.
Until my coach told me,
"Hey, you can't muscle through.
You have to surrender."
And when I finally
surrendered to the pain,
I started noticing all these
details I hadn't before.
I noticed I was shivering,
which meant I was burning valuable oxygen,
just trying to stay warm.
My wetsuit felt a little too tight,
so I actually wasn't able to get
a full inhale before I went in.
I started noticing
all of these little changes
that we began to make and address,
and it made all the difference.
Stripped of the emotional component,
fear is simply information.
It tells us exactly what we need
to know in order to progress.
And when we addressed all of these things,
everything changed.
Six weeks later,
I escaped Houdini's trick
in two minutes and 40 seconds.
(Applause and cheers)</p>

### 90天黑带挑战

这是我在20位传奇武术家面前，即将惨败的场景。通常获得跆拳道（Taekwondo: 一种韩国武术）黑带需要三到五年，但我希望能看看在短短90天内是否可能做到。所有人都认为这很疯狂，许多人也理所当然地质疑这样做是否合适。所以我知道，只有得到一位受人尊敬的大师（Grandmaster: 武术中的最高级别）的认可，我才能取得进步。传奇人物Simon Rhee大师就是这样一位人物。称他为“最强者中的最强者”绝不夸张，因为他本人就主演了电影《最强者》（The Best of the Best）。（笑声）我们一起完成了没有人认为可能的事情。在短短90天内，Rhee大师指导我通过了每一次级别的考试。黄带、绿带、蓝带、红带。我获得了参加黑带考试的许可。Rhee大师的黑带考试是一个持续数小时的严酷考验。你必须表演数百套套路，你必须同时与三位黑带选手对打。但最后一步，你必须用手打碎一块砖头。经过数小时的汗水，我终于来到了这一步，这是通往黑带的最后冲刺。然后，发生了这样的事。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">This is me in front of a panel
of 20 martial arts legends
about to fail spectacularly
in front of all of them.
A black belt in taekwondo typically takes
three to five years to earn,
but I wanted to see if it
would be possible in only 90 days.
Everybody thought it was crazy,
and many people rightfully
questioned if it was even appropriate
to do something like this.
So I knew I could only progress
with the blessing of a respected master.
Enter the legendary
Grandmaster Simon Rhee.
To call this man the best of the best
actually is not an exaggeration,
because he literally starred in the movie
"The Best of the Best"
(Laughter)
And together, we did
what nobody thought was possible.
In just 90 days,
Master Rhee coached me
to pass every single belt test.
Yellow, green, blue, red.
And I was granted permission
to test for the black belt.
Now Master Rhee’s belt test
is a multi-hour gauntlet.
You have to perform hundreds of forms.
You have to spar
three black belts at once.
But for the final step,
you have to break a brick with your hand.
And after many hours of sweat,
I made it here to this final step,
the final inch to the finish line
for the black belt.
And this is what happened.</p>
</details>

### 失败是过程的必要部分

（视频）“ sir，允许我打破吗？” Rhee大师：“允许。” 结果什么都没发生。甚至连裂缝都没有。我因此整个黑带考试都失败了。但Rhee大师给了我一个机会。他冒着自己的声誉风险来验证这是否可能。我意识到，放弃这个挑战比放弃我自己更糟糕。这将是对他的辜负。所以，在这段视频发布到YouTube几个月后，我一直在继续训练。在第264天，发生了这件事。（尖叫声）（掌声）失败，尽管痛苦，却是过程的必要部分。当我们感到失望和失败时，这是一种荣幸，因为它意味着我们在乎。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">(Video) Permission to break, sir.
Master Rhee: Permission granted.
So nothing happened.
Like not even a crack.
And I failed the entire
belt test because of it.
But Master Rhee had taken a chance on me.
He put his reputation on the line
to see if this would be possible.
And I realized that giving up
on this challenge
would be worse than giving up on myself.
It would be giving up on him.
So I kept training for months
after this video released on YouTube.
And on day 264, this happened.
(Screams)
(Applause)
Failure is, as painful as it is,
a necessary part of the process.
And when we feel
disappointment and failure,
it's a privilege because it means we care.</p>

### 最终特技：团队协作与“欢迎恐惧”政策

这让我们回到了这里。在我尝试我职业生涯中最危险的特技前几分钟。一次10分钟的飞行，我被绳索固定在这架军用飞机（C-130）的侧面。这是我们团队面临过的最艰巨的后勤挑战，而“业余心态”至关重要。我们必须敢于提问，敢于犯错，并愿意寻求帮助。在片场，我们实行“欢迎恐惧”政策。这意味着在任何时候，船员中的任何人都可以提出担忧，并在全体人员面前得到解决。这一策略使我们能够微调每一个细节，从保护我眼睛的定制隐形眼镜，到安全带的紧度，甚至是FAA（FAA: 美国联邦航空管理局）的批准文件。这是我们能够毫无疑问地确保自己为不可能做好准备的唯一方法。在团队的支持下，几周后，它实现了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Which brings us back here.
Moments before I attempted
the most dangerous stunt of my career.
A 10-minute flight pattern
with me tethered to the side
of this military aircraft.
This was the greatest logistical
challenge our team had ever faced,
and an amateur's mindset was crucial.
We had to be unafraid to ask questions,
to make mistakes along the way,
and be willing to ask for help.
On set, we had a "fear is welcome" policy.
This meant that at any moment,
anyone on the crew could raise a concern
and it would be addressed
in front of the whole group.
This strategy allowed us
to fine-tune every single detail,
from the custom contact lenses
I wore to protect my eyes,
to the tightness of the harness,
to even the FAA approval paperwork.
It was the only way
we could ensure, without a doubt,
we were ready for the impossible.
And with the support
of this team, weeks later,
it happened.</p>
</details>

### 结论：并非无畏，而是因恐惧而行动

当我开始制作“挑战接受”节目时，我以为会有那么一个神奇的时刻，我终于会觉得自己像一个无所畏惧的冒险家。但那个时刻，无论好坏，实际上从未到来。但这正是我做这些事情的原因。不是因为我无所畏惧。而是因为我确实害怕。谢谢大家。（欢呼和掌声）

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">When I set out
to make "Challenge Accepted"
I assumed there would be
a magical moment
where I'd finally feel like a daredevil,
a woman without fear.
But that moment,
for better or for worse,
actually has never come.
But that is exactly why I do these things.
Not because I'm unafraid.
But actually because I am.
Thank you.
(Cheers and applause)</p>
