Hello everyone, happy new year. The Lao Zhou Heng Mei channel successfully surpassed 500,000 subscribers before the arrival of 2026, concluding 2025 perfectly. I am truly grateful to all the loyal viewers who watch my program every week; you are my motivation to keep creating. Thank you.

Today is also New Year's Day. Rather than discussing heavy topics, I want to take this opportunity to share my journey of being banned nationwide by the CCP. How did I go from a professional manager with a background in computer science and finance to a million-follower blogger within the Great Firewall? Under what circumstances was I banned? And after being banned, how did I become an influential and excellent blogger in the global Chinese-language media in a very short time?

### 初探自媒体：好奇心与意外的爆火

I started creating content on social media purely out of curiosity. It was mid-2020, and due to the pandemic, my company was relatively quiet. So, I posted a video on Douyin. Unexpectedly, my first video went viral, gaining over 40,000 followers in three days. The title of that video was "Has China's Innovation Surpassed America??". In the video, I argued that while China seems to have a lot of innovation these years, it's mostly application-level innovation, and there is still a very long distance from the underlying technology compared to the United States. This viewpoint might not seem novel now, but five years ago, hardly anyone had systematically proposed it. Thus, the video exploded. A few days later, after reaching over 8 million views, the video was reported and taken down.

Back then, Sino-US relations weren't as bad as they are now, and nationalist sentiment within China hadn't intensified to today's level. Otherwise, the video would have been removed long before reaching 8 million views. The virality of this video gave me great confidence. I thought, "Wow, even without perfect Mandarin pronunciation, many people are willing to listen to me." And so, I embarked on the path of social media creation, treating it as a hobby outside of work, wanting to share my values with the world, without many other aspirations.

However, my early content on Douyin was primarily科普 (popular science). I often commented on social hot topics, but as you know, there isn't much space on Douyin to criticize CCP policies. Over the next two years, through repeated experiences of throttling and video takedowns, I gradually learned how to skirt the edges and use implicit language to comment on China's social issues. Honestly, I believe one of the skills that allowed me to gain so many followers within the Great Firewall, and for my account to survive so long, was knowing the boundaries of the red line and constantly dancing on its edge.

### 忍耐的智慧与爆发的临界点

Here, I want to share a principle, or rather, a realization I've come to: To do enlightened work within the Great Firewall long-term, you must learn patience. When advising other mainland bloggers, I often present them with a choice: Would you rather have 300 people see 100% of the truth, or 3 million people see 70% of the truth? This is what I mean by patience. You hold back the 30% you most want to say to allow the other 70% to reach more people. Not speaking some things isn't cowardice; it's long-termism. Because if you can't hold back, your videos will inevitably be suppressed, quickly taken down, rendering your 100% truth meaningless.

Of course, for someone like me, who hates evil and speaks their mind in real life, this kind of patience is extremely painful. This is why, over the past year and more, I have so deeply enjoyed and cherished the freedom to speak my mind without restraint on YouTube.

By 2022, with the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine War and the entire year of Dynamic Zero-COVID, I found myself unable to hold back any longer. First, during the Russia-Ukraine War, my videos condemning Russia led to constant reports from pro-Russia fans, resulting in a six-month ban on my Douyin account. Those who cheer for war are both ignorant and malicious. Do you know why wolf warriors shout about war every day? It's simple: they aren't the ones fighting on the front lines; they are usually huddled in a dilapidated room, typing mindless words on keyboards whose letters are almost worn away. When they talk about their own country's history of invasion, they grit their teeth. When they see others being invaded, they clap their hands in approval. I suddenly understood that those who wielded U-shaped locks weren't actually hating the invaders and the war; they just hated that they themselves hadn't beaten everyone else down. They don't love peace; they only care if they win.

During the Dynamic Zero-COVID period, I began to continuously criticize the zero-COVID policy on WeChat Channels. At that time, WeChat Channels was just starting out. To capture market share from Douyin, the censorship was quite lenient. Seizing this opportunity, I began to criticize on a larger scale. I made over a dozen videos criticizing the epidemic prevention policies, using sarcasm and direct attacks. Several of these reached over 100,000 shares.

One video compared the probability of severe Omicron cases versus being struck by lightning. This video caused a huge stir and was shared widely. Through friends, I learned that many well-known Chinese doctors were forwarding it in their private groups. The probability of becoming severely ill after contracting Omicron is 0.0000037%. What does this mean? Let's compare it to, say, the probability of any of us being struck by lightning in our lifetime, which is about 0.0000125%. This means you'd have to be struck by lightning 3.3 times to have the same chance of becoming severely ill from COVID in Shanghai. The probability of accidental death from flying is 0.00019, 53.5 times higher than becoming severely ill from COVID in Shanghai. The probability of drowning is 0.0008823 times. The probability of accidental death by poisoning is 0.0051400 times. If you find these numbers abstract and unreliable, that's fine. Let's look at some direct figures. According to Ministry of Public Security data, in 2020, China had 61,703 traffic accident deaths, roughly 1.7 deaths per 10,000 vehicles. 270,000 positive cases, 9 severe cases, zero deaths. So, after the lifting of restrictions, will we still take taxis to work? Will we drive our children to school? Because the probability of death from traffic accidents is far greater than the current probability of severe illness from COVID in Shanghai. With 270,000 positive cases and not a single death, over the past month, how many small business owners, restaurant operators, and ordinary people have gone bankrupt, lost a lifetime of savings, and felt life was worse than death? How many have died because they couldn't get timely medical treatment for other illnesses? In this world, nothing is perfect; it's all about trade-offs, about balance. In the current state, we've sacrificed a lot. But what have we gained? And for what?

At that time, WeChat Channels' censorship was still quite lenient. This video was shared over 300,000 times before it was finally taken down. Later, when 27 asymptomatic people being transferred to makeshift hospitals in Guizhou in the middle of the night resulted in a rollover accident killing 27 people, and when Urumqi residential compounds sealed their entrances, preventing residents from escaping during a fire, I was so enraged. I posted videos criticizing these events, and they were all eventually taken down.

Seeing my videos constantly removed but my account not banned, anger surged, leading to a drastic change. Knowing full well the consequences, I couldn't help but post a video mocking Xi Jinping. Of course, to ensure the video could spread, I needed skill. I had to use an implicit satirical approach, making it understandable to the audience while preventing the authorities from using it as direct grounds to arrest me.

As expected, this video led to my first ban on WeChat Channels. It was a very short video, only about forty seconds. I'll play it here for you to revisit.

"There's a question that's been bothering me lately, and I hope experts can help. The other day, my friend was driving on the highway and found that everyone else was driving the wrong way. He swerved frantically but was still convinced everyone else was going the wrong way, and he was the only one going the right way. Then, a few days ago, he was bitten by a mosquito and, in a fit of rage, declared he would kill every mosquito in the entire neighborhood. He went out with an electric mosquito swatter and hasn't returned for three days and nights. I'm very concerned about my friend. I'd like to ask, to what extent has his self-confidence exploded? Does he need to see a psychologist? Waiting online, urgent?"

When this video was released, it immediately exploded. Within two hours of posting, it had hundreds of thousands of views, and the traffic growth was accelerating. What was frightening was the flood of sensitive comments in the comment section, such as "I know who your friend is, he looks like a little bear," or "Is your friend surnamed Diao, as in 'diao man' (barbaric)?" – implicitly referring to Xi. To ensure the video could spread wider and longer, I hesitated for a moment before reluctantly closing the comment section. But a few hours later, the video was still taken down, and I received notification that my WeChat Channels account was banned for one month.

Frankly, one month was shorter than I expected. Perhaps because WeChat Channels was just starting, they didn't want to ban a high-traffic account. But by the time they banned me, nearly a million people had seen my "exploding self-confidence" video. I felt the one-month ban was very much worth it.

### 告别上海与价值观的抉择

By the latter half of 2022, I was already preparing to leave China. My family left at the end of December, and I stayed behind to handle the aftermath. Three months later, in March 2023, I officially landed in Singapore. Before leaving, I released my farewell piece, my last video from Shanghai, which also went viral and was eventually taken down.

"The day has finally arrived. This might be my last video recorded in Shanghai; you won't see this background anymore. For 15 years and 3 months, I've lived here for over a third of my life. I truly feel it's a great pity. Over the past five to eight years, the atmosphere has gradually changed. Especially in the last two years, I've witnessed many things that I, from my personal values, cannot accept. This is certainly not Shanghai's problem; I know Shanghai is also helpless, as are my friends and I. I realized that the so-called rule of law is superficial, where the ruler is greater than the law. At critical moments, laws can be arbitrarily changed according to the ruler's will. So, my departure isn't due to any impact on my quality of life, but because I've seen many things that clash with my values. For instance, the principle 'Wind may enter, rain may enter, but the king shall not enter' is a sacred and inviolable golden rule for us. And other incidents? Like hazmat-suited personnel entering homes and killing pets after the owner was quarantined – it made me feel I could no longer live here, nor did I want my daughter to grow up in such an environment. Even so, I still have deep affection for Shanghai. But with a large number of foreigners leaving, I knew the quality of education in international schools would be significantly affected. For my daughter's sake, I had to leave. Honestly, I don't think I'll live better in Singapore than in Shanghai, but I know I'd rather sacrifice some convenience to gain something I deeply believe in. I still deeply love Shanghai and the many kind, sincere, and passionate friends I've met here over the past 15 years. I sincerely hope, oh how I hope, that the atmosphere will reverse again, allowing me to return to live in my beloved Shanghai. I look forward to that day. This is Lao Zhou. February 25, 2023, Pudong New Area, Shanghai, signing off."

More than two years have passed. Looking back at these two videos, I still feel quite emotional. But today, it seems my predictions for China's future years – including economic issues that would inevitably emerge after the lifting of pandemic restrictions, the property bubble that was bound to burst, the intensification of nationalist sentiment, and increasingly strict speech controls – have all come true as I expected. Leaving, though regrettable, was absolutely the right decision.

### 被逼上梁山：YouTube的意外突围

Actually, after moving to Singapore, I continued to update my Douyin and WeChat Channels. Many people assume I was banned in China, left Shanghai, and then started YouTube. That's not the case. In fact, it's the reverse: I was banned from my mainland accounts because I started doing YouTube. I left the Great Firewall in March 2023, three months after the pandemic restrictions were lifted, but the nationwide ban by the CCP didn't happen until over a year later, in April 2024.

Why did I continue updating Douyin and WeChat Channels after leaving Shanghai? Because I truly love Shanghai. When I first arrived in Singapore, I often joked, "If Xi Jinping dies today, I'll pack my bags and return to Shanghai tomorrow." But honestly, the most golden 15 years of my life, the 15 years after graduating college and truly becoming an adult, were spent in Shanghai. Shanghai holds my career, my youth, my family, my friends. How could I stop paying attention to Chinese news just because I left? Moreover, I felt a responsibility to my fans within China. I felt that after they had followed and supported me for so long, I couldn't just abandon them. So, my thinking at the time was: as long as the CCP doesn't ban me, I will continue to speak out.

If there are any trolls here who insist I wanted to keep earning money from Chinese people, save your breath. I had millions of followers on mainland platforms but never monetized a single cent. Feel free to ask my old fans who followed me on Douyin from the beginning if they ever saw me do a product placement or sell a course. When I left Shanghai, I had already achieved initial capital accumulation through Shanghai real estate; I didn't need to rely on this for a living. I continued creating content simply because I had to speak out, because I regretted Xi Jinping's regression and felt sorry for the Chinese people, and because I wanted to continue achieving self-worth. Content creation is something I am very good at and passionate about. Based on my abilities, personality, and interests, I believe there is nothing more suitable for me than being a serious, rigorous, and professional content creator.

However, starting my content creation career with short videos, I never imagined doing long-form YouTube videos until about 20 months ago. I was actually forced into it, which I'll explain in more detail later. It wasn't until a full year after arriving in Singapore, in March 2024, that I first attempted to create a long-form video specifically for YouTube, and it immediately gained good traction. A month later, in April 2024, I released "The Past, Present, and Future of China's Great Firewall." This episode became a massive hit. Many people first got to know Lao Zhou through this program. It is, to date, the highest-traffic video on the Lao Zhou Heng Mei channel.

Just a few days after this episode became popular, Douyin, WeChat Channels, and Bilibili simultaneously sent me permanent account ban notifications. This sudden, cross-platform simultaneous ban, similar to how accounts are blocked for "进" (entering) or "护尘" (protecting dust - likely a reference to another banned user or term), indicates two things. First, this was not a platform decision; it must have been an instruction from the Cyberspace Administration of China (网信办) to the platforms. If it were the platforms, it's unlikely they would have banned accounts simultaneously, especially since I had already transitioned to YouTube and hadn't updated on those platforms for over two months. So, it couldn't have been due to any specific content. Second, they clearly knew who I was. They knew that this newly emerging dissident on YouTube, Lao Zhou Heng Mei, was the same person as Lao Zhou Che Tan from within the Great Firewall. Yes, my previous account within the Great Firewall was called Lao Zhou Che Tan; all my old fans know this.

In fact, within the first year after moving to Singapore, I returned to Shanghai several times to handle the sale of my property and meet old friends. But after they banned my cross-platform accounts on the same day, I never dared to go back. Although many say I'm a foreigner and they can't do much to me, perhaps only ban my entry, under Xi Jinping, many things no longer operate according to logic. Times have changed, and I don't want to take that risk.

So, let me talk about my feelings after being banned. Although I never did product placements or monetization with my short videos, those were accounts I had poured over three years of effort and heart into. More importantly, it was a platform that allowed my voice to be seen and heard by tens of millions. I cherished it greatly. I remember receiving the ban notification around 6 PM while I was walking alone on East Coast Park. Suddenly, I received an unusual WeChat notification. I don't know what the person who was banned from "Hu Chen Feng" felt. When I received my notification, my mood was calm and undisturbed. I had known for a long time that this day would eventually come. But more importantly, I had already started achieving results on YouTube, gaining nearly 50,000 subscribers in 45 days. I knew I could do long-form videos, and I knew there was a place for me in overseas Chinese media. That calmness came from having another place to express myself, and not having to be evasive or implicit like before, but a place where I could speak my mind without reservation.

In fact, the reason I decided to start YouTube was because the tolerance for speech on mainland short-video platforms was decreasing. Around the end of 2023, if I posted 10 videos, about 5 would be throttled, and 3 would be taken down. This ratio made it almost impossible to speak. One day, I forced myself to honestly face a reality: when you say things that an authoritarian government dislikes, your fate depends solely on the ruler's decision. With the press of a button, all your efforts can vanish instantly. This principle might sound simple, but when you are part of the system, you always hold onto a sliver of hope, like the "Hu Chen Feng" case. In reality, if he had honestly faced the situation, he should have known his account ban was inevitable.

At this point, many people ask me: "You've already left the Great Firewall, why did it take over a year to start YouTube? If you had started earlier, you might have millions of subscribers by now." This question is very understandable, but the answer is simple: human inertia and self-limitation. Because I was too comfortable with short-form video. For any social event, I could quickly complete the script, recording, and editing within two to three hours. Once posted, as long as it wasn't throttled or taken down, it would get hundreds of thousands, or even tens of millions, of views. This is an influence that is very hard to give up. And I knew exactly how to make good short-form content. This feeling of staying in my comfort zone is what delayed me for a year from trying long-form video.

The second reason is self-limitation. My content creation career started with short videos. Short-form content needs to be fast-paced, grabbing the audience's attention within seconds, and explaining things within 3 to 5 minutes. After three years and hundreds of videos, I had developed a habit. So, frankly, over a year ago, I didn't believe I had the ability to elaborate on a topic for ten to twenty minutes.

Let me share a little secret. For the 15 years I was in Shanghai, I rarely used a VPN. Occasionally, I would use it to read The New York Times or similar publications. I only watched English-language programs on YouTube. Before I moved to Singapore, I had never watched any Chinese-language program on YouTube. I didn't even know any Chinese bloggers. After arriving in Singapore, a friend suggested I try making long-form videos and recommended "Wang Ju Pai An" and "Duolun Duo Fang Lian." That was my first time watching content from outside the Great Firewall. At the time, I thought these programs were so long. Honestly, deep down, I felt I couldn't produce such long videos; I didn't have that much to say.

It wasn't until one day in March 2024, after several of my WeChat Channels videos were taken down, that I couldn't stand it anymore. I decided to try YouTube. My strategy was to expand a video I had made within China called "China's Insurmountable Obstacle in Artificial Intelligence." When I posted it in China, the script was about 100 words, taking about 4 minutes. I thought, "Can I double it, include the parts I wanted to say but knew would never pass censorship, expanding it to 2,000 words? That would make the video about 8 minutes, which should be long enough." But unexpectedly, once I released my mental shackles and stopped censoring myself, which had been forcefully trained by the strict censorship mechanism for over three years, my thoughts flowed like a spring, unstoppable. I quickly wrote 5,000 words. My debut YouTube long-form video, about 20 minutes long, posted on an account with only 1,000-plus subscribers, immediately achieved great results. It now has over 400,000 views on YouTube.

From then on, I embarked on the path of YouTube content creation, surpassing 100,000 subscribers in 4 months, 300,000 in the first year, and reaching 500,000 in 20 months. It's quite ironic, really. The existence of today's Lao Zhou Heng Mei can largely be attributed to being forced by the CCP. If they had taken down fewer videos back then, perhaps I would still be stuck in my comfort zone, posting self-censored, evasive, short videos that couldn't convey the full message. By stepping out of my comfort zone, I discovered that YouTube is truly a place where I can unleash my talents.

Have you heard of the flea experiment? If you put several fleas in a glass jar with a lid, the fleas constantly try to jump out but hit the lid each time. After a few days, you remove the lid. However, these fleas have learned the height of the ceiling and will now only jump to the original lid's height, never jumping out. In many ways, we are like these fleas, constantly told by those around us or our environment that we can only jump this high, only go this far. Subtly, we come to believe it. Even someone like me, who has always been very confident since childhood, found myself trapped in the linguistic cage built by China's Cyberspace Administration from the very beginning of my content creation career. As a result, I didn't even know how high I could fly once I was out of the cage.

Thinking back to two years ago, when I first watched videos by "Wang Ju Pai An" and "Duolun Duo Fang Lian," as a short-form video creator, I admired them greatly, thinking I could never produce such content. But today, my subscriber count has basically caught up to Fang Lian. In the past six months, my channel's subscriber growth has surpassed both Wang Ju Pai An and Caijing (a finance channel). Sometimes, I feel deeply moved and very fortunate that I took this step.

### 扬长避短：斯坦福的抉择与人生策略

Alright, finally, I'll answer a question frequently asked by viewers: "Why, with the halo of Stanford Computer Science, didn't you go work for a Silicon Valley tech giant like Google, Microsoft, or Amazon? That seems more aligned with your educational background." This might expose my shortcomings a bit, but honestly, it's because at Stanford, I encountered too many true computer science and math geniuses. I genuinely felt I couldn't compete with them. Let me tell you a story that led to my awakening.

When I was taking a computer science course at Stanford, on the first day of class, I saw a very young-looking Indian person. I asked my friend, "Hey, this kid looks like a middle schooler, why is he taking this class?" Since it was a master's level or above course, the young man seemed particularly out of place. My friend said, "Don't you know him? Apparently, this person hacked into the systems of several Indian companies at the age of 14, leaving messages for their network administrators about system vulnerabilities and how to fix them. Several governments reportedly consulted him." At that moment, I was blown away. You understand? I thought, "What is he doing in this class? Raising the bar for us?"

But it wasn't just this one incident. Honestly, I met too many geniuses at Stanford. Previously, throughout my academic journey, those smarter than me weren't as hardworking, and those more hardworking weren't as smart. But here, everyone was both smarter and more hardworking than me. During a summer internship, I also worked at Qualcomm, the developer of Snapdragon chips. My colleagues there, besides those from Stanford, were all from MIT, Berkeley, and Carnegie Mellon. I thought then that in the Silicon Valley job market, if I had to compete head-on in math and computer science with these individuals, I truly couldn't win; at the very least, I couldn't reach the absolute top tier in this field.

However, I believed my communication skills, eloquence, and ability to interact with people were stronger than theirs. Therefore, I decided to leverage my strengths. I began self-studying finance and pursued a career in finance after graduation. Later, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos shared a similar story. At Princeton, he was studying theoretical physics. Once, he struggled for days to solve a partial differential equation. A classmate solved it in a few minutes. At that moment, he knew he couldn't become a top theoretical physicist. It's about playing to one's strengths and avoiding weaknesses, choosing a track that better utilizes one's talents.

Some might think these two points I've made today are contradictory: on one hand, I encourage everyone to break out of their comfort zone, and on the other, I say to choose areas where you excel. But these two points are not contradictory. Breaking out of your comfort zone is to break the ceiling, while choosing your strengths is to go further under a higher ceiling. One is about breaking limitations, the other is about optimizing choices. Combining these two is truly the most valuable life strategy for ordinary people.

2025 has concluded, and 2026 marks a brand new beginning. I hope Lao Zhou's story serves not just as a tale of hardship, but as one that can inspire and enlighten you. I hope that in the new year, everyone can find their own shining track and have the courage to jump out of the glass jar that limits your height.

Thank you again for your companionship over the past year. I am Lao Zhou, from the Heng Mei team, speaking frankly. Happy New Year to everyone. Thank you for watching. When subscribing, please be sure to turn on the little bell icon so you can receive timely notifications when I update.
