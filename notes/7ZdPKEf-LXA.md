### 身份的崩塌与重塑

探讨个体身份超越职业、头衔与成就的本质，是许多人在人生剧变时被迫面对的深刻议题。当演讲者倾注十年心血创立的公司轰然倒塌时，她发现自己赖以生存的身份认同也随之瓦解，陷入了对“我是谁”的迷茫。

Do you ever wonder who you are
beyond your job, your titles,
your accomplishments?
This is the question
I was forced to confront
when the company I'd spent a decade
pouring my soul into shut down.
My work had been my entire identity,
and without it,
I didn't know who I was anymore.

### 宏大使命与内在代价

十年前，她联合创立了 **Embrace**，一个致力于为服务不足社区的早产儿提供低成本便携式孵化器的社会企业。这项技术无需持续电力供应，使其能在全球偏远地区使用。她们怀揣着“拯救一百万婴儿”的宏大目标，她本人也因此移居印度，将此使命视为生命。多年来，Embrace 成功挽救了数千名婴儿的生命，其中不乏像内森（Nathan）这样被遗弃、体重仅两磅半的婴儿，最终在孵化器中得以生存并被收养。这些故事曾是她坚持下去的动力，也赢得了**奥巴马总统**的认可和**碧昂丝**的资助，工作成果在全球广为报道。然而，在外人看来光鲜亮丽的成功背后，她内心却饱受压力、精疲力竭和自我怀疑的煎熬，工作重担几乎让她窒息。

<details><summary>Original English</summary>
Ten years earlier,
I had co-founded Embrace,
a social enterprise that created
a low-cost portable incubator
for premature babies
in underserved communities.
Our technology could work
without constant electricity,
making it usable
in remote parts of the world.
We set an audacious goal:
to save a million babies.
I moved to India,
where over 20 percent of all
the world's premature babies are born,
and I made that mission my life.
Over the years,
we saved thousands of babies.
Babies like Nathan,
who was abandoned on a street
weighing just two and a half pounds.
He was rescued by an orphanage
and kept inside our incubator for weeks.
He survived.
Seven months later,
I visited the orphanage
and I held him in my arms.
A few months after that,
he was adopted by a family in Chicago.
Stories like this kept me going.
Along the way, we were recognized
by President Obama
and funded by Beyonce.
(Cheers)
(Laughter)
Our work was featured in headlines
all over the world.
On the outside, it looked
like a success story.
But the truth was, on the inside,
I felt like I was drowning in stress,
exhaustion, self-doubt.
The work weighed so heavily on me,
there were moments I felt
like I could barely breathe.

### 跌落谷底与疗愈启程

在历经十年、无数次从制造、分销到资金筹措的挑战后，公司最终被迫关闭。这次失败将她推入了人生的最低谷，她经历了恐慌发作、抑郁、失眠，身心灵俱疲。为了寻求疗愈，她踏上了一段旅程，带着冲浪板和行李箱，买了一张单程票前往印度尼西亚，以同样投入公司的强度来疗愈自己，视之为生存的必要。她形容自己要“把疗愈做到极致”。

<details><summary>Original English</summary>
Ten years in,
after countless setbacks
from manufacturing to distribution
to funding challenges,
we had to shut down the company.
I failed.
I hit the lowest point of my life.
I was having panic attacks,
I was depressed, I couldn't sleep,
I felt completely broken
in mind, body and spirit.
So I decided to set off
on a healing journey.
I packed a surfboard and a suitcase,
and I bought a one-way
ticket to Indonesia,
where I threw myself into healing
with the same intensity
I'd once poured into my company.
I was willing to do anything
because this was a matter of survival.
I was going to heal
the shit out of myself.
(Laughter)

### 童年阴影的深层挖掘

在印尼，她尝试了各种极端的方法：在丛林中数日静默冥想直至产生幻觉（她半开玩笑地说那些“打了类固醇的蟑螂”是真的）；进行迷幻剂旅程；与鲨鱼共潜以学习放松（她自嘲为何不能像常人一样做个按摩）；甚至为了进行一种据称能净化过去的青蛙毒素仪式而灼伤腿部，结果却感觉像是排空了所有吃过的东西。然而，真正的突破源于她开始直面童年创伤。她的父亲通过“逼迫她追求卓越”来表达爱意，例如在周末早晨，一边为她温暖冰冷的双脚，一边考她乘法口诀。这种严苛的训练让她赢得了所有数学竞赛，但当她未能达到父亲的期望时，则会遭受“暴力”惩罚。十二岁那年，她因在自家草坪上阅读历史书而被父亲暴打，并被要求道歉。她拒绝了，因为那是她第一次确信自己没有做错，但也深切体会到自身的无力感。

<details><summary>Original English</summary>
I meditated for days in silence
in the jungle until I hallucinated.
Although I'm pretty sure
those cockroaches on steroids were real.
(Laughter)
I did psychedelic journeys.
I dove with sharks
so I could learn to relax.
I don't know why I couldn't just
get a massage like a normal person.
(Laughter)
I burned holes in my leg
for a frog poison ceremony.
It was supposed to purge my past.
Instead, I think I purged everything
I'd ever eaten in my entire life.
(Laughter)
But the real breakthroughs came only
when I began to confront my childhood.
Growing up, my father showed his love
by pushing me to excel.
I remember in second grade,
on weekend mornings,
I would cuddle with him
and he would warm my cold feet under his
as he quizzed me on my times tables.
Thanks to those drills,
I won all the math
competitions in my class.
When I didn't meet his expectations,
I was punished.
Violently.
When I was 12 years old,
I came home from school one day
and I decided to read my history book
on the front lawn.
It was a beautiful sunny day.
When my father came home and saw this,
he flew into a rage.
He decided homework
shouldn't be done on a lawn,
it should be done at a desk.
And so he beat me.
And he demanded that I apologize.
I refused because
for the first time in my life,
I knew I had done nothing wrong.
I also knew I was utterly powerless.

### 创伤驱动的使命与阴影

在进行疗愈工作时，她终于将这些经历联系起来：童年时期感受到的极度无力感，驱使她去帮助世界上最无助的人群。她的痛苦转化为了使命，但也成为了她的“阴影”。无论拯救了多少婴儿，获得了多少赞誉，她始终觉得自己“不够好”。有时，创伤会转化为驱动力、完美主义和过度工作。有些人用物质麻痹痛苦，而她则用“生产力”来麻痹自己。她深爱自己的工作，但也坚信自己的价值完全取决于成就。最终，她停止了试图通过成就来摆脱痛苦的循环。

<details><summary>Original English</summary>
As I did this healing work,
I finally connected the dots.
Feeling so powerless
throughout my childhood
had driven me to help
the most powerless people in the world.
My pain had become my purpose.
But it had also become my shadow.
No matter how many babies I saved
or how much recognition I received,
I never felt like I was enough.
Sometimes our trauma
gets channeled into drive,
perfectionism, overwork.
Some people numb their pain
with substances.
I numbed mine with productivity.
I cared deeply about my work,
but I also believe that my worth
depended on what I achieved.
I finally stopped trying
to achieve my way out of pain.

### 疗愈的三重路径：感受、放下与关怀

寻找自我之路始于放慢脚步，允许自己去感受。在生命的大部分时间里，她为了生存而压抑情感。研究表明，大多数人都会这样做，通过工作、饮酒、社交媒体等方式逃避痛苦的情绪。然而，压抑的情感并不会消失，反而会以更强烈的方式（如焦虑、抑郁、倦怠）重新浮现。因此，她选择全然感受，拥抱不适，直至泪尽而泣，因恐惧而颤抖，因愤怒而咆哮。她认识到，痛苦无法通过思考或工作来解决，必须“感受”才能穿越。其次，她学会了“放下对结果的执着”。世事无常，唯一确定的是不确定性。海洋的瞬息万变（风、潮汐、涌浪）让她深刻体会到这一点。因此，保持“临在”并对任何事物（包括结果）不执着至关重要。她意识到，对Embrace结果的过度执着，让她超越了自身极限，而公司的失败则彻底粉碎了她的自我认知。如今她明白，自己并非由外部的成功或失败定义，内在的品质——是否以爱行动、是否在成长、是否给予他人——才是真正重要的。她无法控制海浪，但可以选择如何驾驭它们。最后，她学会了“自我关怀”。这包括认识到自己内在的各个面向：那个曾奋力战斗的“战士”（一位前任戏称她为“简·成吉思汗”）；那个驱使她超越疲惫的“过度追求者”。她还发现了那个被保护的内在小孩，那个害怕自己“不够好”的小女孩。长久以来，她渴望他人证明她的价值，但从未奏效。于是，她终于转向内在小孩，说出了她一直需要听到的：“我很抱歉。你不该遭受那些。你已经足够好，并且被爱着。”而那个小孩，最终相信了她。

<details><summary>Original English</summary>
Here's how I found my way back to myself.
First, I slowed down
and I just let myself feel.
For most of my life, I had disconnected
from my emotions to survive.
Research shows most of us do this.
We avoid painful emotions
through working, drinking, social media
and other endless distractions.
But when we suppress our emotions,
they don't go away.
They actually resurface more intensely,
often as anxiety, depression or burnout.
So I let myself feel it all.
I got really comfortable
with being uncomfortable.
I sobbed until I had no more tears left.
I trembled with fear.
I raged with anger.
I learned you can't think
your way out of pain.
You can't work your way out of it.
You have to feel your way through it.
Second, I learned to let go of outcomes.
Everything is constantly changing.
The only thing that is certain
is uncertainty.
Nothing teaches me
this lesson more viscerally
than being in the ocean,
where my conditions are changing
moment to moment,
based on the winds, the tides, the swells.
Because of this,
it's so important to be present
and to not be attached to anything,
including outcomes.
I realized I'd become so attached
to an outcome for Embrace
that I pushed past all my limits,
and when the company failed,
it shattered my sense of self.
I now know I'm not defined
by my external successes or failures.
It's who I am on the inside
that truly matters.
Am I acting with love?
Am I growing?
Am I giving to others?
I can't control the waves,
but I can choose how I want to ride them.
And lastly, I learned self-compassion.
I did this through recognizing
all the different parts of myself.
The warrior who had fought every battle.
One of my exes nicknamed
this part of me “Jane-ghis” Khan.
(Laughter)
The overachiever who had pushed me
to work past exhaustion.
I discovered the part
they were protecting,
the little girl inside me
who was so scared
that she wasn't enough.
For so long, I wanted everyone else
to show her that she was worthy.
It never worked.
So I finally turned towards her
and I finally said the things
that she had always needed to hear.
I'm so sorry.
You didn't deserve that.
You are enough
and you are loved.
And she believed me.

### 韧性重定义：拥抱真实的自我

她现在明白，**韧性**（Resilience: 面对逆境、压力或创伤后恢复并适应的能力）并非源于坚韧不拔，而是源于“温柔”。它意味着以关怀对待自己，并深刻地认识到，无论成就如何，甚至超越了人生目标，我们本身就已足够。她曾以为疗愈是“修复”自己，如今则知晓，疗愈的真谛在于“爱”自己。这一点至关重要，因为我们与自己的关系，深刻地塑造了人生中所有其他关系，无论个人还是职业层面。在一次奇迹般的转折中，Embrace 得以重生，截至今年已惠及超过一百万婴儿。她为这一成就感到骄傲，但最令她自豪的，是学会了“拥抱自己”。

<details><summary>Original English</summary>
I now know resilience
isn't about toughness.
It's about tenderness.
It's about treating
ourselves with compassion
and knowing deep in our bones
that we are enough just as we are,
beyond our achievements
or even our purpose.
I once thought
healing meant fixing myself.
Now I know it means loving myself.
And this is so important
because the relationship
we have with ourselves
shapes every other
relationship in our lives,
both personally and professionally.
In a miraculous turn of events,
Embrace was saved.
As of this year, it's impacted
over a million babies.
(Applause and cheers)
I'm so proud of this accomplishment,
but what I'm most proud of
is learning to embrace myself.
Thank you.
(Applause)
