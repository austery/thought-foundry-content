### 开盘直击：市场普跌与 Cloudflare 服务中断

大家早上好，欢迎回到新一期的市场开盘直播。今天是 11 月 18 日，星期二，感谢各位的到来。不仅盘前市场下跌，Cloudflare 也宕机了。不只是它的股票在跌，而是整个公司的服务都中断了。结果导致今天许多网站无法正常工作。例如，我获取新闻的重要渠道 X 平台就完全无法使用。我知道很多人也从 X 获取新闻。它曾短暂恢复过，但随后又停止工作，现在再次陷入瘫痪。如果有人发现它恢复正常了，请告诉我。但我目前无法登录，什么也看不到，页面完全加载不出来。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Good morning everybody. Welcome back to another episode of the market open. We are live. It is Tuesday, November 18th. Thank you everybody for being here. Not only are the pre-markets down, but Cloudflare is down. Not just the stock, the stock is down, but also the entire company's services. And as a result, a lot of different websites have not been working today. X, for example, which is a big place that I get my news. I know a lot of people get their news from X. That's just not working at all. I mean, it was working for a little bit and then it stopped working. Now it's not working again. If it ever starts working for people, let me know. But I cannot log on and see anything. Nothing is loading.</p>
</details>

我曾担心同样依赖 Cloudflare 的 Streamyard 今天也会中断，但到目前为止一切顺利。所以，如果直播突然中断，那很可能是 Streamyard 的问题。希望这种情况不会发生。但可以肯定的是，Cloudflare 确实无法正常工作。尽管如此，我们再次迎来了盘前市场的普跌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I was worried that Streamyard, which also runs on Cloudflare, would be off today. But so far so good. So if the stream stops randomly, it most likely is a Streamyard thing. Hopefully that doesn't happen. But definitely Cloudflare is not working. Nonetheless, we got a red pre-markets once again.</p>
</details>

英伟达下跌 1%，Meta 股价跌至过去五周最低点，盘前报 592 美元，下跌 1.5%。VMware 下跌 1%，标普 500 指数下跌 0.5%。标普指数一度触及 660.5 点，而我们之前的位置是 662.2 点。我们非常接近跌破昨天的低点，基本上就在这些水平。所以，当市场开盘时，我们将观察它会跌到多低。但我们确实在下跌。谷歌因伯克希尔哈撒韦的消息逆市上涨 1.4%。特斯拉下跌，Palantir 下跌 2%，Robin Hood 再跌 2%，亚马逊下跌 3%，微牛证券下跌 2%，IONQ 下跌 2%，Rocket Lab 下跌 2%，Zeta 下跌 1.3%，Oklo 下跌 3%，PayPal 下跌 0.5%，Duolingo 下跌 1%，AMD 下跌 2%，微软下跌 0.5%，美光科技下跌 2%。情况很糟糕。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Nvidia down 1%. Meta, lowest it's been in the past five weeks, 592 in the pre-markets, that's down 1.5%. BMR is down 1%. S&P 500 down half a percent. S&P got to 660.5. We were at 662.2. We are very close to violating the lows of yesterday, which was basically at these levels. So, when the market opens, we're going to see how low it goes. But we are down. Google somehow green with the Bergkshire news. Google up 1.4%. Tesla's red. Palenteer is down 2%. Robin Hood's down another 2%. Amazon's down 3%. Weeble's down 2%. IN's down 2%. Rocket Lab down 2%. Zeta down 1.3. Oaklo down three. PayPal down half. Dualingo down one. AMD down 2%. Microsoft uh down half a percent. Micron down 2%. It's ugly.</p>

### 就业数据解读：喜忧参半的信号

这又是一个难熬的日子。昨晚在收盘节目中，我们详细讨论了当前的市场状况以及我的看法和观点。我昨天和许多不同的人交流，试图分析正在发生的事情。昨晚我做了一些研究，有了一些看法和想法。在我看来，最终这一切都归结为一个简单的问题。这个简单的问题与英伟达无关，尽管我认为英伟达的业绩会非常出色。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">It is once again an ugly day. We talked a lot last night on the market close of what's going on and kind of my thoughts and my opinions on it. I talked to a bunch of different people yesterday and tried to get some analysis on what's going on. I did some research last night. I have some perspectives. I have some ideas. And look, ultimately it's boiling down to a simple question in my opinion. And that simple question is nothing to do with Nvidia, even though I think Nvidia is going to crush it.</p>
</details>

顺便说一下，我们从 **ADP** (Automatic Data Processing, Inc.: 美国自动数据处理公司，提供人力资源管理软件和服务，其发布的就业报告是市场关注的重要经济指标) 得到了一些就业数据，但基本上没什么大影响。有两点：ADP 报告上周就业人数减少了 2500 人。这个负 2500 人的报告与我们过去几周看到的情况非常一致。要知道，10 月份他们报告的是每周增加 11000 个工作岗位，所以负 2500 还可以接受。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">By the way, we got some jobs data from the ADP. It's kind of a nothing burger. Um, two things. 2500 jobs down ADP said for last week 2500 jobs down is um like a negative 2500 report that's very consistent what we saw over the past couple weeks I mean a capac in October they said it was 11,000 jobs per week so negative 2500 is fine.</p>
</details>

我们昨天得到的另一份非常重要的数据，是它随机出现在劳工统计局（BLS）网站上的，没有任何预定的发布时间。那就是我们本应在每周四得到的初请失业金人数。我们得到了 10 月 18 日那一周的数据，不知道有没有人看到，是 23.2 万人。这个数字并不算衰退水平，衰退水平通常要超过 35 万人。所以这实际上是一个相对不错的就业数据。我确实看到，在那个数据公布后，股市开始走高，我记得大概是在凌晨 12 点，因为市场觉得“哦，情况没那么糟”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the other piece of data we got yesterday that was also really important and it just randomly showed up on the BLS website there was like no scheduled release or anything anything was the jobless claims that we're supposed to get every Thursday we got them for the month or for the week of October 18th I don't know if anyone else saw this uh 200 32,000 jobless claims. 232,000 jobless claims. So that came out last night. And that's not recessionary. Recessionary is upwards of 350,000 jobs. So that was actually a relatively decent jobs number. And you I actually saw stocks like start to move higher as soon as that number came out. I think it was at like 12 a.m. because markets were like, "Oh, it's not that bad."</p>
</details>

但我认为我们不会得到实际的 10 月份就业报告。记住，我们将在周四得到 9 月份的就业报告，预计会增加约 5 万个工作岗位，这无关紧要。那会没事的，但那是 9 月份的数据。我们需要的是最糟糕的 10 月份数据，但我们得不到。所以我们得等到 11 月的数据出来。我不知道那份就业报告会是什么样子，但就目前而言，我们没有太多数据，这也是我认为市场陷入困境的另一个原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But I think the actual October uh jobs report we are not going to be getting. We're remember we're getting September's uh job report on Thursday which is estimated to be like 50,000 jobs which is whatever. Um you know that's going to be fine but that's September. We're we we need like the worst of the worst which was October and we're not getting that. So we're going to have wait till we get November. I don't know what that job report is going to look like but um as of now you know you just don't have a lot of the data and that's another reason I think that the market is struggling.</p>
</details>

### 核心症结：悬而未决的美联储降息

现在最重要的事情是降息。我一直在反复思考降息这件事，试图理解到底发生了什么。我们到底为什么迟迟得不到这次降息？它对经济的影响有多大？为什么我一直纠结于此？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The most important thing right here is the rate cut. I keep coming back to the rate cut to try to understand what is happening. Why the hell are we not getting this rate cut and how much is it affecting the economy and why do I, you know, keep going back to that?</p>
</details>

让我们从这个话题开始。摩根士丹利的顶尖股票研究分析师和投资组合策略师之一 Mike Wilson 昨天发表了一份声明。他说，明年标普指数将达到 7800 点。昨晚我读他的报告时就在想，他为什么如此自信？他是如何构建这个论点的？我找到了他两周前的一个视频，我想和大家一起看看，因为我认为这确实提供了很多背景信息。他的论点并非那么疯狂。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, let's get started with this topic. Mike Wilson, who is one of Morgan Stanley's top equity research analysts and top portfolio strategist, he came out with a statement yesterday and Mike Wilson is saying 7,800. He's saying 78 freaking 100red next year. And I'm reading his report last night and I'm like, why is he so confident? How is he making this argument? And and I pulled up a video of him from two weeks ago that I want to watch with everybody because I do think it really gives a lot of context. Um his argument is not that crazy.</p>
</details>

当然，他可能错了。毕竟他是摩根士丹利的顶尖人物之一，他在 2023 年因为过于悲观而判断失误。也许他在 2025 年的预测上又有点过于乐观了。但所有这一切都取决于降息。在我看来，美联储从降息立场上的转变，正在严重损害市场对股票价格的看法。因为如果我们（的政策）落后于曲线，或者说美联储远远落后于曲线——Mike Wilson 认为我们至少需要降息 150 个**基点**（Basis Points, bips: 金融术语，1个基点等于0.01%）才能达到中性利率——那么你就会遇到一些问题。因此，如果我们正在应对这些降息问题，股市就很难上涨。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now, maybe he's wrong. Again, he's one of Morgan Stanley's top guys. He was wrong in 2023 to be too bearish. Maybe he's being a bit too bullish in 2025. But all of it rests on the rate cut and the pivot that we got from the Fed to not cutting rates is really in my opinion substantially hurting the the way equity prices are being perceived because if we are behind the curve or if the Fed is steeply behind the curve which you know Mike Wilson thinks we need 150 bips of cuts at minimum to get even to neutral then you know you're going to have some issues and as a result it's kind of hard for the equity markets to kind of go higher if we are dealing with those rate cuts.</p>
</details>

以太坊价格为 3000 美元，比特币为 91000 美元。比特币确实跌破了 90000 美元。我仍在尽力弄清楚比特币到底发生了什么。感觉 Tom Lee 的观点是对的，整个行业似乎存在结构性的追加保证金通知，导致某个机构正在抛售。然而，我觉得距离那次 200 亿美元的清算已经过去大约一个月了，如果真要发生，现在也该发生了。我认为现在更多的是散户在说“去他的，我不玩了”，这种抛售压力也开始显现。昨晚我们确实失守了 90000 美元大关，我们会看看它是否会再次触及那个水平。但我认为，这与缺乏降息一起，也是一个重大担忧，并因此扰乱了许多不同的投资组合。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Ethereum right there 3,000 and then Bitcoin 91,000. Bitcoin did fall below 90,000. I am still trying to figure out to the best of my ability what is going on with Bitcoin. Again, it does feel like Tom Lee is right. There is this structured margin calls that are being placed across the industry and as a result there's some institution that is selling. However, I feel like, you know, it's been about a month since we had that $20 billion liquidation. If that was going to happen, that should have happened by now. I think now it's more retail that's just saying screw it, I'm out of this thing. And that selling pressure is also starting to take place. We did lose 90,000 last night. We'll see if it ever revisits that. But um you know that along with lack of rate cuts I think is also a big concern and as a result it's kind of messing up a lot of different portfolios.</p>
</details>

X 平台现在恢复工作了。让我看看。是的，我的也恢复了。太好了。好的，我们又能用 Twitter 了，可以浏览一些内容了。好了，让我播放 Mike Wilson 的视频。我认为这能为我们理解他如何看待市场演变，以及为什么他认为降息是美联储需要给予我们的最重要的事情之一，提供一些背景。如果我们能在未来几周内真正得到就业数据，也许我们就能得到降息。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">X is working now. Let me see. Is X working? X is working for me too. Correct. Awesome. Okay, cool. We got Twitter back so we'll be able to go through some of the stuff. All right, let me play Mike Wilson. I think this will give a little bit of context for at least how he thinks the market is revolving and why he thinks the rate cut is one of the most important things that the Fed needs to give us. Uh and maybe we'll get it if we actually get the jobs data over the coming weeks.</p>

### 摩根士丹利 Mike Wilson 的激进预测：标普7800点的可能性

> > 消费、增加投资。好的，这是一个完全不同的经济体。这是一个对过去三年表现不佳的所有公司来说，周转速度更快的经济体。我们一直处于某种衰退之中。我坚信这一点。我们对此做了研究，并就所谓的**滚动式衰退**（Rolling Recession: 指经济中不同行业在不同时间点相继经历衰退，而非整体经济同时下滑）进行了分析，我认为这种衰退已经持续了三年。大部分私营经济都在受苦，而政府则在支撑局面。然后我们基本上看到所有这一切在四月份达到了顶点，我称之为“投降日”，那基本上是政府部门的衰退，是滚动式衰退的最后一块拼图。如果你看看挑战者公司的裁员数据，再看看现在非农就业数据的修正值，在我看来，就业人数的变化率在四月份达到了低点，而挑战者公司的裁员变化率则在四月份达到了高点。所以市场已经搞清楚了这一切。这就是为什么修正广度直线上升。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Consumption, increase investment. Okay, it's a totally different economy. And what that is, it's a it's a higher velocity economy for all the companies that haven't been doing well for the last I would say three years. We've been sort of in a recession. I I would argue strong. We've we've done the work on this and you know we we've done the analysis with respect to the rolling recession that has been in place for I would say three years most of the private economy kind of suffering government kind of carrying the water and then we basically saw all of that come to uh fruition at the end in April April capitulation day as I call it was basically the government recession that was the final piece of the rolling recession and if you actually look at the challenger job cuts and you look at the revision data now on the on the NF on the payroll data it it it it looks to me like a rate of change low okay in payrolls and a rate of change high in challenger job cuts came in April. So the market's figured all this out. That's why revision breath has gone straight up.</p>
</details>

> > 那么，滚动式复苏，我们现在处于哪个阶段？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So rolling recovery where are we in those stages?</p>
</details>

> > 我们在四月份将其定义为滚动式复苏，现在我们看到市场上的这些领域并非所有都会同时复苏，因为这是一次非典型的衰退。它不像所有东西都同时崩溃，然后又同时恢复。所以它将是分阶段的，我们在市场上已经看到了这一点。坦率地说，市场仍然很狭窄。人工智能的资本支出仍然是早期复苏的领域之一。半导体作为一个早期周期性行业，但我们没有看到其他所谓的早期周期性行业像在新经济周期中那样典型地复苏。为什么？因为美联储落后于曲线。美联储在利率问题上远远落后于曲线。他们需要将利率降得更低。如果你真的想让私营经济动起来，现在的利率太高了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> So we we we deemed it the rolling recovery in April and we're now seeing that like these areas of the market are not everything's going to recover at once because it's it's an unorthodox recession. It's not like everything flushed at once and everything recovers at once. So it is going to be staged and we've seen that in the market. We're still narrow quite frankly. AI capex is still is is kind of one of early recoveries here. Semiconductors being an early cycle group, but we're not seeing the other quote unquote early cycle groups recover the way they typically do in a new economic cycle. Why? Because the Fed is behind the curve. The Fed is way behind the curve on rates. They need rates much lower. If you really want to get the private economy moving, rates are too high.</p>
</details>

> > 更低。你认为需要低多少才能实现市场的普涨？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Much lower. How much lower do you think that really is required to get that broadening out?</p>
</details>

> > 好吧，让我们从两年期国债收益率开始。我的衡量标准一直是，如果联邦基金利率高于两年期国债收益率，那么美联储就落后于曲线。为了刺激私营经济，我认为他们需要远低于这个水平。所以，仅仅达到中性就需要 50 个基点，可能还需要再降 100 多个基点才能达到对普通公司和消费者更具刺激性的水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Well, let's just start with the two-year Treasury yield. Okay. So my barometer is always the Fed is behind the curve if they if Fed funds is above two-year Treasury yields. And in order to stimulate the private economy, I would say they need to be well below that. So that's 50 basis points just to get to neutral and maybe another hundred plus to get to something that's more stimulative for the average company and the average consumer.</p>
</details>

Mike Wilson 在这里提出的论点是，在特朗普政府时期，经济已经从消费驱动转向投资驱动，“大而美法案”确实优先鼓励了企业进行投资。这就是为什么所有这些数据中心投资都从监管角度得到了各种方式的回报。例如，数据中心的分区法就非常有利。所以他的论点是，如果我们正处于经济的投资阶段——而在过去 15 年里，美国公司并没有真正被激励去投资——那么我们就需要通过降低利率来刺激经济。因为投资最简单的方式之一就是能够借到资本，而借贷资本意味着更低的利率和更低的借贷成本，这意味着利率需要下降，才能建造所有那些就业岗位、工厂、数据中心建设工地等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> the argument Mike Wilson is making right there is that the economy has shifted in the Trump administration from consumption to investing and the big beautiful bill has really prioritized companies to invest. That's why you have all these data center investments being rewarded in a variety of different ways from a regulatory perspective. For example, zoning laws for data centers have been very accretive. So his argument is that if we are in an investing part of this economy which for the past 15 years American companies have not really been incentivized to invest then we need to stimulate by lowering rates because one of the easiest ways to invest is that if you can borrow capital borrowing capital means lower rate lower borrowing costs which means rates needs to come down in order to be able to build all those jobs and factories construction sites for data centers etc.</p>
</details>

所以他的论点是，标普 500 指数中有 10 家公司表现良好，承担了大部分的重担。其他 490 家公司基本上一直处于滚动式衰退中。那场衰退在四月的“解放日”触底。他的论点是，现在我们正处于滚动式复苏中，到明年年底，标普 500 指数的目标是 7800 点。但要实现这一目标，他的论点是你必须让利率下降。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Uh so his argument is you have 10 companies in the S&P 500 that have done well and that are carrying the bulk of the load. The other 490 have been essentially in a rolling recession. That recession bottomed in April during liberation day. And his argument is now we are on a rolling recovery with a 7,800 S&P 500 target by the end of next year. But in order for that to realistically happen, his argument is you got to get rates to come down</p>
</details>

### “滚动式复苏”理论：经济新周期的开端？

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> on that broadening out and expecting maybe AI to underperform going forward as they invest more in some of these uh debt sales and the infrastructure side and the rest of the economy plays catch-up.</p>
</details>

> > 当然。想想这种资本支出的涓滴效应。我的意思是，它不仅仅会影响半导体公司。这里面有很多基础设施建设，很多就业创造，实体经济中有很多的资金流速，贷款渠道可能会为中小型企业开放，放松管制也是这个故事的一部分。所以，如果事情按预期发展，这绝对应该发生。当然，这也有风险。比方说，美联储继续说，“嘿，我们仍然认为存在通胀风险。我们不喜欢 3% 的通胀率。我们不打算提高我们的目标”，然后他们就拖延下去。那么市场就会保持狭窄，资金会继续集中在高品质股票上。而我们现在正处于这个阶段，Lisa，人们基本上在试图在这两种结果之间做出选择。我想说，现在，大多数机构投资者仍然挤在高品质股票里。他们还没有真正做出转变。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Absolutely. Think about the trickle down effect of this capital spending. I mean, it's not just going to be semiconductor companies. There's there's a lot of infrastructure. There's a lot of job creation. there's a lot of velocity in the real economy and the lending channel starts getting going perhaps for small medium businesses that job creation deregulation is another part of that story. Okay, so absolutely that's what should happen if things play out the way they they could. Now there's risk to that. Let's say the Fed continues to say, "Hey, you know, we still think there's inflation risk. We we don't like the, you know, inflation rate at 3%. We're not going to raise our our targets there and and we just kind of drag their feet." It's going to stay narrowed then. It's going to stay up the quality curve. And that's where we are right now, Lisa, is that people basically are are are trying to choose between those two outcomes. And I would say right now, most of the institutional community is still huddled into the high quality stocks. They haven't really made the transition yet.</p>
</details>

> > 为了让这种转变奏效，美联储必须降息。这是它所依赖的条件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> In order for that to transition to work, the Fed has to cut though. That's what it's contingent on.</p>
</details>

> > 这是主要因素之一。放松管制是其中的一个重要部分。资本支出也是一部分。这些都可以在美联储不大幅降息的情况下发生，但这真的会巩固局面。如果你回顾所有这些不同的经济周期，小盘股和中盘股，也就是质量较低的股票，通常在美联储利率低于两年期国债收益率之前是不会跑赢大盘的。我们已经记录了这一点。所以，这并不意味着这些股票在绝对值上不能上涨，只是意味着你在早期周期轮动中通常看到的相对优异表现，需要联邦基金利率远低于当前水平。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> It's it's one of the main things. Now, Dereg is a big part of that. Okay. The capital spending is a part of that. Those can happen without the Fed cutting significantly, but it would really it would really solidify it for And if you go back and look at all these different economic cycles, small caps and mid, you know, lower quality stocks typically don't outperform until the Fed gets below two-year Treasury yields. We we've documented this. So, by the way, it doesn't mean these stocks can't work in absolute terms. It just means that relative outperformance you typically get in that early cycle rotation needs Fed funds to be much lower.</p>
</details>

所以 Mike Wilson 实际上在论证我们正处于周期的早期。这绝对是一个与许多其他人相反的观点。但话说回来，这也不算太反常，因为华尔街上他的所有同事对标普指数的目标价位也都在 7500 到 7700 的范围内，如果展望到 2026 年的话。所以，他的论点只是我们需要降息，而为了得到降息，美联储必须承认他们落后于曲线。过去三周市场如此糟糕的部分原因，是因为我们完全转变了，或者说美联储完全转变了我们在 12 月份获得降息的想法。降息的概率持续下降，这也给股市带来了很多痛苦。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> so Mike Wilson actually making the argument that we are early cycle. I mean, it's definitely a contrarian perspective from a lot of the other people. Then again, it's not as contrarian because all of his colleagues on the street have a lot of the same targets on the S&P, right around that 7,7500 range if you go out into 2026. So, um, his argument is just we need rate cuts and in order to get those rate cuts, the Fed has to acknowledge that they're behind the curve. And part of the reason over the past three weeks why things have been so ugly is because we've not we've completely pivoted or the Fed has completely pivoted on the idea of us in in any sense of the imagination actually getting those rate cuts in December. probabilities have continued to go down and that has also led to a lot of pain in the equity markets.</p>
</details>

### 悲观情绪蔓延：AI 泡沫论与市场恐惧

目前降息概率是 50%，昨天是 41%。所以也许 ADP 公布的上周就业人数减少 2500 人的数据让这个概率上升了。乐观情绪来自于一个很简单的逻辑：如果我们 11 月份的就业报告很糟糕，并且这份报告非常明确地告诉美联储：“伙计们，别再瞎折腾了，劳动力市场情况不妙，通货膨胀不是问题，真的不是你们应该担心的事。” 我认为降息概率会跃升至接近 90%，我们就会得到降息。我不知道股市会作何反应，但我绝对不认为股市会因此暴跌。如果我们得不到降息，我认为股市会受挫，这是显而易见的。你可以看到过去几周的震荡，市场几乎就像在降息与否的边缘摇摆不定。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, we're at 50% right here. We were at 41% yesterday. So maybe some of that jobs data by ADP negative 2500 jobs for last week got these probabilities go up. Here's where the optimism comes in and and I think it's actually quite simple. If we get a bad jobs report in November and that jobs report tells the Fed very obviously guys like stop messing around. The labor market is not okay. like inflation is not the concern, right? It really is not the thing you should be worried about. I think that probability jumps closer to 90% and we get a rate cut. I don't know what the stock market does, but I definitely don't think the stock market has to take a dump. If we don't get the rate cut, I think it's more obvious than not that the stock market's going to get hit. And you can see the choppiness in the past couple weeks. It's almost like the market's teetering and tottering on the idea of if we get a rate cut or not.</p>

与此同时，最搞笑的是，当我看分析师对股票的评级上调时——我用了 TipRanks，所以能收到很多这类通知——所有的都是上调和买入评级。全部都是。Robin Hood 今天得到了 160 美元的目标价和买入评级。昨天，巴克莱银行将 Robin Hood 的目标价上调至 168 美元。奥本海默昨天将谷歌的目标价从 290 美元上调至 320 美元。我的意思是，如果你们还记得 2022 年，那时候很多都是降级评级：卖出、离场、下调目标价，因为在一个美联储加息、盈利增长停滞的世界里，股票是碰不得的，而这正是我们在 2022 年所经历的。

<p class="english-text">And at the same time, the the most hilarious thing about this is um when I look at analyst upgrades on stocks and I have tip ranks, so I you know, I get a lot of these notifications. All of these are upgrades and buys. All of them. Robin Hood got a buy for 160 today. Yesterday, Barkclay's upgraded Robin Hood 168. Google got an upgrade by Oppenheimer yesterday to 320 from 290. I mean, if you guys remember 2022, like a lot of it was downgrades. sell, get out of the market, reducing our price target because stocks are untouchable in a world in which the Fed is hiking and then in a world in which earnings growth is not there, which is what we had in 2022.</p>
</details>

也许这种情况会在 2026 年到来，也许这些分析师只是在努力维持希望，但尽管如此，Robin Hood 的基本面没有任何改变，谷歌也没有，CoreWeave 也没有。CoreWeave 的股价从 150 美元暴跌到 75 美元，我理解他们有很多债务，但天哪，把它砍掉 50% 似乎有点太激进了。所以问题就变成了，经济中是否发生了结构性的变化，导致了这种抛售？目前来看，答案可能是否定的，但也可能是肯定的，只是我们需要更多数据来证实这一点，希望我们能尽快得到这些数据。

<p class="english-text">I mean, maybe that's going to come in 2026, you know, maybe these analysts are just uh trying to keep the hope alive, but nonetheless, nothing fundamental has changed for Robin Hood. Nothing has changed for Google. Nothing has changed for Cororeweave. I mean Cororey getting slapped from 150 to 75. It's like I get it they have a lot of debt but my goodness like taking it down 50% seems a bit aggressive. And so the question simply then becomes you know is there something structurally that has changed in the economy that has led to this type of selloff and as of now the answer might be no but the answer might be yes it's just we need a little bit more data to kind of solidify that and you know hopefully we get that data soon.</p>

顺便说一句，恐惧与贪婪指数现在是 13。我们在 4 月 8 日时是 4，最低点是 4。现在是 13。所以，我不知道。如果你看看这个指数的历史，看看时间线，4 月 8 日我们实际上是 3。然后一路飙升到 70。到 6 月份又一路下跌到 57。再跳升到 74。又一路下跌到 50。然后我们跳到 66。再一路下跌到 23。那是一个买入机会。然后又上涨。我的意思是，每次我们技术性反弹，都是从极度恐惧到恐惧。所以理论上，你会想象也许这是一个买入机会。问题是，人们是否相信这是一个买入机会？

<p class="english-text">Fear and greed, by the way, is at 13. We were at four on April 8th. The lowest we were was at four. And um you know, now we're at 13. So, I don't know. I mean, if you look at the history of this thing as well, look at the timeline again at at we were at three actually on April 8th. We jumped all the way up to 70. Then came all the way down by June to 57. Jumped up to 74. Came all the way down to 50. Then we jumped to 66. Then we came all the way down to 23. That was a buying opportunity. Came up. I mean, every time we bounced technically, we went from extreme fear to fear. So theoretically, you would imagine that maybe this is a buying opportunity. The question is just do people believe it's a buying opportunity?</p>

更不用说，我不知道这是否出现在大家的算法推荐里，无论是在 YouTube 还是 Twitter 上，但天哪，最近为我弹出的关于泡沫、悲观论调、“一切都是假的，一切都将崩溃”的内容数量之多，简直太疯狂了。而我并不一定是最悲观的人。所以，这些内容出现在主流渠道上，有点疯狂。昨天彭博社就有一个长达 57 分钟的播客，嘉宾是金融界备受尊敬的 Jeffrey Gundlach，他基本上在说所有东西都被高估了，你必须赶快逃离一切。**私人信贷**（Private Credit: 指非公开交易的债务融资，通常由非银行机构提供给企业）是一个巨大的泡沫。他将其比作 2006 年，并说我们将要崩溃。然后看看我推荐视频里的 Jesse Felder，他说“史无前例的 AI 泡沫即将破裂”。这简直变得越来越激进，兄弟。感觉就像市场情绪在迅速转变。

<p class="english-text">Not to mention, um, I I don't know if this has been showing up in people's algorithm, whether it's on YouTube or or Twitter, but my goodness, the amount of bubble bearishness, it's all fake, it's all going to collapse stuff that has been popping up for me, and I'm not necessarily the most bearish person ever. So, the fact that it's popping up on mainstream channels, it's kind of crazy. I mean, you had an entire 57 minute podcast yesterday with Jeffrey Gunlock, who is pretty respected in the finance world on Bloomberg, basically saying everything's overvalued. You got to get the hell out of everything. Uh, private credit is a massive bubble. He compares it to 2006 and he's saying we're going to collapse. And then look at the video on my recommended. Jesse Felder, the AI bubble of all bubbles is about to hit. It's just like it's becoming aggressive, bro. It's almost like sentiment is shifting rapidly.</p>

### 机构动向与市场博弈

就买入下跌而言，机构一直在买入。我展示了很多这方面的数据，我们有越来越多的图表显示机构一直在持续买入。对冲基金一直在卖出，散户投资者实际上也一直在卖出。但根据彭博社和路透社的数据，机构资金管理人一直在有意义地买入下跌的股票。我看了各种不同的图表，他们都持续显示，美国银行的 ETF 资金流入也持续显示，机构正在买入。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now again, in terms of buying the dip, institutions have been buying. I've been showing a lot of that data and we have more and more charts that show that institutions have continued to buy. Hedge funds have been selling. Retail investors have actually been selling. But institutional money managers have been meaningfully buying the dip as per Bloomberg, as per Reuters. I'm looking at a variety of different charts and they continue to say Bank of America ETF inflows continue to say that institutions are buying.</p>
</details>

所以这也引出了一个问题，这到底是不是一个假象？是不是做市商在试图吓唬人们？基本面是否发生了如此大的变化，以至于 Robin Hood 在 125 美元时看起来还合理，而现在华尔街似乎想把它打到 100 美元以下？到底发生了什么实际的变化？我认为首先是加密货币受到了冲击，所以 Robin Hood 因此受挫是理所当然的，这很公平。但我们会回到 90 美元吗？Nebius 会回到 50 美元吗？SoFi 会回到 15 美元吗？我们是否正在进入周期的那个阶段，今年我们拥有的所有收益都将烟消云散？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So it also then begs the question of like okay I mean is this a fake out? Is this a lot is this uh market makers trying to get people scared? Has something fundamentally changed to such an extent that you know Robin Hood at 125 seemed reasonable and now it looks like the street wants to take Robin Hood below 100. like what realistically changed? I think the first thing that changes crypto took a hit, right? So, obviously Robin Hood deserves to get hit a bit off that and that's fair, but are we going back to 90 bucks? Are we, you know, is Nebius going back to 50 bucks? Is SoFi going back to 15? Like, are we are we getting to that part of the cycle where everything that we had this year, all of those gains just collapse?</p>
</details>

我不这么认为。这感觉有点太激进了。我这么说不是因为什么鲜花和彩虹，而是因为盈利增长。像 SoFi 这样的公司的盈利增长是惊人的，Hood 的盈利增长也是惊人的。现在，也许 Hood 的估值倍数过高，这一点我理解，我几个月来也一直在说。我理解它不需要涨到 150 美元，但我不认为它需要回到 95 美元。我觉得那样的话我们就低估了太多东西。看起来这些最终，希望最终会成为好的买入机会。但我认为这一切都取决于美联储以及他们想在降息问题上做什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I don't think so. I mean, that feels a bit aggressive. And the reason I'm saying that is not because of like like like like flowers and rainbows. It's because of earnings growth and like the earnings growth on a SoFi is amazing. The earnings growth on a hood is amazing. Now maybe Hood's multiple aggressive. That's why I understand I've been saying that for months. I'm like I understand it doesn't need to go to 150, but I don't think it needs to go back to $95. Like I think we're discounting a lot at that point. And it seems like those end up those hopefully will end up just becoming good buying opportunities. But I think it really is all up to the Fed and what they want to do with rate cuts.</p>

### 地缘政治与企业动态速览

家得宝今天公布了财报。他们的每股收益（EPS）未达预期 2%，为 3.74 美元，而预期为 3.83 美元。营收超出预期，为 413.5 亿美元，而预期为 411.2 亿美元。家得宝股价下跌了 4%。我认为下跌 4% 不仅仅是因为这些数字，很可能是因为整个市场都在下跌，除非他们在财报中说了些我没看到的关于关税的事情，我们可以在他们的财报中查看，但这可能是目前对他们造成影响的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Home Depot, they had earnings today. They missed by 2% on EPS, 374 versus 383. Beat on revenue 41.35 versus 41.12. Uh, Home Depot stock is down 4%. I don't think it's just down 4% on those numbers. It's probably down because the entire market is down unless they said something about tariffs that I didn't see, which we can check out in their earnings, but that could be hurting them right now.</p>
</details>

中国的百度也公布了财报，营收和利润均超预期。这家公司就像中国的谷歌。他们的股价下跌了 4%。顺便说一下，日本新任首相，她相当有胆识。在与中国外交官的会晤中，她基本上说，如果你们试图入侵台湾，我们将保卫自己，因为这将触发他们宪法中关于自卫的条款。因为日本有一些非常靠近台湾的岛屿。所以她说，“嘿，如果你们想搞什么动作，我们基本上会武装起来。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, we had by due from China. They beat on the top and the bottom. This is like China's Google. These guys are down 4%. By the way, the Japanese prime minister uh the new Japanese prime minister, she is uh she's pretty ballsy. Let's just say that. In a meeting with Chinese diplomats, she basically said uh if you guys try to invade Taiwan, we will defend ourselves because it will create it will trigger a clause in their constitution around self-defense. And so if you because you know there there are islands that are very close to Taiwan that Japan owns. And so she was like, "Hey, if you try to do anything like we're going to strap up basically."</p>
</details>

中国对此的反应是，“哦，是吗？” 这就是为什么中国对日本发出了旅行警告，现在他们正在阻止某些人前往那里，停止某些国有企业进行贸易。中国基本上就像……中国说的原话是“我们将斩首任何试图干涉中国政治和我们自身防卫关切的人”。他们基本上是说，离我们想做的事情远点。所以，中国采取了十年前对韩国使用的同样策略，当时韩国人开始对中国可能入侵台湾的话题发表更具攻击性的言论。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And China was like, "Oh, really?" And that's why China triggered the travel warning to Japan and now they're blocking certain people from going there. They're stopping certain state-owned businesses from doing trade. And China is basically just like uh China said the exact quote was we will decapitate anyone that tries to interfere in Chinese politics and our own self-defense concerns. And uh basically they said stay away from what we're trying to do. So, China deployed the same strategy 10 years ago with South Korea when the South Koreans started talking a little bit more um aggressively around, you know, China potentially invading Taiwan.</p>
</details>

实际上，在过去十年里，在这位新任日本首相之前，之前的日本首相，比如安倍，他们什么都不说。你知道，就好像是，“嘿，我们就是不谈论那个。” 这位女士几天前说，“我要谈论它。” 中国人对此非常不满。所以这是另一个一直在困扰中国和日本市场的因素。而且，日本印了大量的钱，或者正准备印大量的钱。所以这也引发了很多关于日本债券市场的事情。我们昨天谈到过，这可能对**日元套利交易**（Yen Carry Trade: 借入低利率的日元，投资于高收益的外国资产以赚取利差）不利。但是，你有这个因素，还有他们对中国说的话，这让日本市场至少变得更加恐慌。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And re realistically over the past 10 years before this new Japanese prime minister, the previous Japanese prime ministers like ashiba, they just didn't say anything. You know, it was kind of just like, hey, we just don't talk about that. This lady a couple days ago, she was like, I'm going to talk about it. And the Chinese got pretty upset about that. So that is another thing that has been aiding the or ailing the the the Chinese and Japanese markets. And you know, Japan printed a ton of money or is getting ready to print a ton of money. So that's also triggering a lot of things around Japanese bond markets. We talked about that yesterday. Potentially not the best for the yen carry trade. But you have that and what they said about China, which is, you know, kind of making at least the Japanese markets a bit more scared.</p>

### 重磅交易：Anthropic、微软与英伟达结成新联盟

Anthropic 将购买 300 亿美元的 Azure 计算能力，这是与微软和英伟达的一项新协议。好的，我的意思是，这很乐观。我不知道市场是否会那么在意。Anthropic 300 亿。哦哇，英伟达和微软将投资 Anthropic。这实际上是更大的交易。哇。好的。Anthropic 承诺购买 300 亿美元的 Azure 计算能力。Anthropic 签订合同，增加高达 1 吉瓦的计算能力。英伟达和微软将投资 Anthropic。英伟达承诺投资 100 亿美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Anthropic to buy 30 billion in Azure capacity, a new deal with Microsoft and Nvidia. Okay, I mean that's bullish. I don't know if that the market's going to care that much. Anthropic 30 billion. Oh wow. Nvidian Microsoft to invest in Anthropic. That's actually the bigger deal. Whoa. Okay. Anthropic is committed to buy 30 billion of Azure compute. Anthropic to contract added comput capacity up to 1 gawatt. Nvidia and Microsoft to invest in Anthropic. Nvidia committed to investing 10 billion.</p>
</details>

好的，好的，这里的问题在于，这只会助长空头们关于**循环融资**（Circular Financing: 指资金在少数几家公司之间循环流转，以创造收入或投资的表象，但并未产生真正的经济价值）的论点。英伟达对 Anthropic 说，我们会给你 100 亿美元。Anthropic 对微软说，“嘿，我们会买 300 亿美元。” 猜猜微软会做什么？他们会从英伟达购买更多的 GPU。它又回到了这个循环中，如果最终有投资回报率（ROI），长期来看无所谓，但短期内，我不知道这是否是一个利好消息。微软购买计算能力的唯一原因是因为 Anthropic 从他们那里购买计算能力，但 Anthropic 从他们那里购买计算能力的唯一原因是因为他们从英伟达那里获得了 100 亿美元的投资。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. Okay, the problem here guys is that the problem here is that this is only feeding into the argument from the bears around this whole circular financing stuff. Nvidia says anthropic we'll give you 10 billion. Enthropic says, "Hey, Microsoft, we'll buy 30 billion." Guess what Microsoft's going to do? They're going to buy more GPUs from Nvidia. it it goes back in this circle that if there is an ROI at the end of the day doesn't matter long term but in the meantime I don't know if this is a bullish headline at all the only reason Microsoft's buying the compute is because Anthropic's buying the compute from them but the only reason Anthrop is buying the compute from them is because they're getting a $10 billion investment from Nvidia</p>
</details>

当然，英伟达股价在这里出现了一点绿色蜡烛图。我认为这笔交易与我们听说的其他交易非常相似，而那些交易，如果你认为有投资回报率，长期来看将是利好的。只是在短期内，我认为市场的直接反应可能会加剧对这种循环融资的担忧。现在，如果 Anthropic 成为一家数万亿美元的公司，他们需要所有这些计算能力，而微软是提供计算能力的基础设施的一部分，英伟达显然是提供芯片的，那么一切就都说得通了。但你必须相信，对于 OpenAI 和 Anthropic 来说，那个最终的北极星是存在的，他们承诺了所有的支出。作为投资者，你必须问自己，你相信吗？因为如果你不相信，它就是循环的。如果你相信，那么它今天看起来是循环的，但未来是真实的。这是更广泛的问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now granted Nvidia getting a little bit of green candle right here I I I don't I I think the deal is very similar to the other deals we've heard and those deals long term if you think there's an ROI will be bullish. It's just in the short term I think the immediate reaction might play into the fears of this circular financing stuff. Now if Anthropic becomes a multi- trillion dollar company and they needed all that compute and Microsoft was part of the infrastructure that provided them the compute and Nvidia obviously was providing them the chips then it all works out but you've got to believe that that that end north star for mic for open AAI and and Anthropic that are committing to all the spending and you've got to ask yourself as an investor do you believe in that? because if you don't, it's circular. If you do, then it's circular today, but it's long-term uh real in the future. That's the broader question.</p>

### 市场实时动态与收盘展望

> > 好的，我们来听听当事人的说法。这三家公司都宣布了这项合作。Satya Nadella 刚刚发布消息说：“非常高兴能和 Dario 和 Jensen 在这里。你们两位所做的事情，英伟达在芯片层面，Anthropic 在认知层面，正在塑造每个开发者和每个组织未来能够构建的东西。在我们这边，我们一直在以光速扩展英伟达在 Azure 可组合集群中的应用，这是 Jensen 多年来一直和我谈论的事情。我们正在继续引领潮流，包括上周我们宣布的 AI 超级工厂。我们也在深化与 Anthropic 的合作，将他们的模型整合到整个 Copilot 系列中。今天，我很高兴地宣布我们正在迈出新的一步。我们将越来越多地成为彼此的客户。我们将使用 Anthropic 的模型，他们将使用我们的基础设施，我们将共同进入市场，帮助我们的客户实现 AI 的价值。”

<details>

<p class="english-text">>> let's hear from the horse's mouth. All three of them announcing this partnership folks uh just posted Super excited to be here with Dario and Jensen. What both of you are doing, Nvidia at the silicon layer and anthropic at the cognition layer is shaping what every developer and every organization will be able to build on going forward. On our side, we have been scaling Nvidia across this funible Azure fleet at the speed of light, something that Jensen's been talking to me about for multiple years now. And we're continuing to set pace, including with the AI superactory we announced just last week. And we've been deepening our partnership with Anthropic as well, incorporating their models across the entire co-pilot family. And today I'm excited to share that we're taking another step. Uh we're increasingly going to be customers of each other. We will use Anthropic models. They will use our infrastructure and we'll go to market together to help our customers realize the value of AI.</p>
</details>

> > 我想最后说一点。作为一个行业，我们真的需要超越任何零和博弈的叙事或赢家通吃的炒作。现在需要的是共同努力，建立广泛而持久的能力，这样这项技术才能为每个国家、每个行业和每个客户带来真实、有形的本地成功。这个机会太大了，不能用任何其他方式来对待。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> I'll close with this. As an industry, we really need to move beyond any type of zero sum narrative or winner take all hype. What's required now is the hard work of building broad durable capabilities together so that this technology can deliver real tangible local success for every country, every sector and every customer. The opportunity is simply too big to approach any other way.</p>
</details>

> > Jensen，你知道，我认为世界才刚刚意识到我们在 AI 旅程中所处的位置。我们看到三个规模定律同时发生。预训练的规模仍然在以惊人的速度扩展。后训练，你给它越多的计算能力，AI 就越聪明。然后当然是推理时间扩展，测试时间扩展，你知道，AI 思考得越多，答案的质量就越高。所以我们现在处于 AI 的一个节点，很明显，我们给它越多的计算能力，越具成本效益的计算能力，token 就越聪明，AI 就会越聪明。AI 越聪明，采用率就越高，无论是在集成这些 AI API 的新应用中，还是你使用它的频率。所以这些 AI 模型的质量现在真的达到了一个拐点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">>> Jensen, you know, I I think the world is just barely realizing where we are in the AI journey. You know, we're seeing uh three scaling laws happening at the same time. Pre-training is scaling incredibly well still. Post-training, the more compute you give it, the smarter the AI. And then of course inference time scaling, test time scaling, you know, the more the AI thinks, the higher the quality of answer. And so we we're now at a point with AI where it is very clear that the more compute we give it, the more cost-effective compute we give it, the more the smarter the tokens, the smarter the AI is going to be. And the smarter the AI, the more adoption both in the new applications that integrate these AI APIs and the more frequently how how more frequently you use it. And so the quality of these AI models now have really reached an inflection point.</p>
</details>

好的，大家怎么看？那是 Jensen、Dario 和 Nadella，他们基本上在说：“嘿，我们需要继续以我们现在的水平进行投资，我们需要继续投入更多的计算能力。” 我认为 Jensen 最后说的话可能是最重要的，那就是在他看来，无论你是否同意他，我们都处于 AI 可能成为的样子的非常早期的阶段。如果是这样，那就需要循环融资，需要供应商融资，需要债务融资，需要所有这些东西来参与这次建设。投资者要么相信这次建设，要么不相信。但建设正在发生，无论他们是否相信，它在未来几年的影响是许多更专注于 AI 的科技公司 CEO 所担心的。我认为他们不太担心这些东西的短期影响。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">All right. What do we think, guys? What do we think? That was Jensen, Daario, and um Nadella basically saying, "Hey, we need to continue investing at the level that we're investing at and we need to keep on putting in more comput." I mean, the thing that Jensen said at the end, I think is probably the most important, which is that in his perspective, whether you agree with him or not, we are at the very early stages of what AI can become. If that's the case, there's going to need to be circular financing. There's going to need to be vendor financing. There's going to need to be debt financing. There's going to need to be all that stuff to engage in this buildout. And investors either will believe in that buildout or not. But the buildout's happening and regardless of if they believe in it or not, the impact of it over the next coming years is what a lot of the more uh AI focused tech CEOs are worried about. And I don't think they're too worried about the the short-term implications of this stuff.</p>
</details>

我真的不想一直说这都跟降息有关，但从我周六开始深入研究过去几周市场可能发生的变化以来，我做的所有研究都指向了降息。降息概率的下降确实改变了很多人的想法，他们认为美联储不是……我们在 22 年加息。如果美联储在 22 年不降息，至少在鲍威尔卸任的五月之前，那么前六个月可能和加息一样，即使他们不降息，我也无法想象他们会六个月不降息。但影响可能是一样的。我认为市场正在将更具限制性的政策解读为对市场不利。然后就好像你在对抗，如果美联储说他们不打算降息，而你在买股票，你就是在对抗美联储，因为美联储在告诉你我们将采取限制性政策。历史上，股票在限制性环境中表现不佳。所以他们在十月、八月和九月表现如此出色的原因之一是，嗯，每个人都觉得美联储肯定会降息。所以宽松周期已经确定了。甚至美联储都说他们很快会停止量化紧缩（QT）。所以停止 QT、降息，所有这些都是有利的环境。一旦你从这个等式中去掉降息部分，你就开始对抗美联储，我认为这就是让市场有点害怕的原因。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Like I really hate to keep saying it's about the rate cut, but from all the research I've done really since starting on Saturday when I started like diving deep into what could have changed in the market over the past couple weeks comes down to the cuts. The probabilities of the cuts going down really shifted a lot of people to thinking the Fed is not the like we hiked in 22. If the Fed doesn't cut in 22, at least until May when JPAL steps down, then the first six months could be the same as hiking, even if they're not cutting, which I can't fathom that they would not cut for six months. Um, but the impact could be the same. And I think the market's kind of interpreting more restrictive policy as uh detrimental to the market. And then it's kind of like you're fighting if the Fed says they're not going to cut and you're buying stocks, you're fighting the Fed because the Fed is telling you we're going to be restrictive. Stocks historically don't do well in a restrictive environment. So one of the reasons they were doing so well in October and August and September is because well, everyone felt the Fed was guaranteed to cut. So the easing cycle was laid out. I mean even the Fed said they're going to stop QT soon. So stopping QT rate cuts, all of that is a conducive environment. soon as you get rid of the rate cuts part of that equation, you start fighting the Fed and I think that's what got the market to be a little bit afraid.</p>
