### AI与我的灵感来源

The school doesn't like AI; they don't really allow it technically.
学校不喜欢人工智能；严格来说，他们并不真正允许使用它。

But what I think is, over the past few years, there's been the rise of **AI** (Artificial Intelligence: 模拟、延伸和扩展人类智能的技术) products.
但我认为，在过去几年里，人工智能产品已经兴起。

Naturally, over the past couple years, we all use AI on a daily basis at school, sometimes for notes or for general answers.
很自然地，在过去几年里，我们在学校日常生活中都会使用人工智能，有时用来记笔记，有时用来寻找一般问题的答案。

And I think the rise of AI in schools, like **ChatGPT** (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer: 一种大型语言模型), and those types of things, also kind of inspired me to do Flow because it opened up a new bridge.
我认为，人工智能在学校的兴起，比如**ChatGPT**（Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer: 一种大型语言模型）以及类似的事物，也启发了我去做Flow，因为它开辟了一座新的桥梁。

### Flow AI：一个通用AI智能体的诞生

My name is Michael, and I'm the founder of **Flow AI** (Flow Artificial Intelligence: 一个通用AI智能体).
我叫Michael，是**Flow AI**（Flow人工智能：一个通用AI智能体）的创始人。

Over the past few months, I've been building a general AI agent that actually gets things done.
在过去的几个月里，我一直在构建一个真正能完成任务的通用人工智能智能体。

From booking flights to canceling subscriptions to making presentations, Flow can do it all.
从预订航班到取消订阅，再到制作演示文稿，Flow无所不能。

This is one step closer to **AGI** (Artificial General Intelligence: 具备与人类同等或更高智能水平的人工智能) and a glimpse of the future.
这是向**AGI**（Artificial General Intelligence: 具备与人类同等或更高智能水平的人工智能）迈进的一步，也是对未来的一瞥。

My name is Michael Goldstein. I'm 13 years old and I live in Toronto, Canada. I'm the founder of Flow AI.
我叫Michael Goldstein，13岁，居住在加拿大多伦多。我是Flow AI的创始人。

Flow is a general AI agent, an agent that can do a wide variety of tasks, not only one certain thing.
Flow是一个通用人工智能智能体，它能执行各种各样的任务，而不仅仅是某一件特定的事情。

### 创业之路：从独自开发到首笔销售

A couple months ago, I had the idea and reached out to multiple developers to ask if they wanted to help.
几个月前，我有了这个想法，并联系了多位开发者，询问他们是否愿意提供帮助。

None of them really said yes, probably because of my age and a bunch of other things.
他们都没有真正答应，可能是因为我的年龄以及其他一些原因。

So I started building it myself using a bunch of AI tools to help.
于是我开始自己动手，借助许多人工智能工具来构建它。

I also do coding lessons every week now so that I can do it myself in the future, without any help from anyone.
我现在每周都上编程课，这样将来我就可以完全自己动手，不需要任何人的帮助。

Someone else said I should live a normal kid life.
其他人说我应该过一个普通的童年生活。

But what I think is just to build. I have a group of friends, our little bubble, and we all have a similar entrepreneurial spirit.
但我认为就是去创造。我有一群朋友，我们就像一个小圈子，都拥有相似的创业精神。

So, a project we did, and still do more of, is weather balloon launches.
所以，我们曾经做过并且还在继续做的项目是气象气球发射。

Those are really big balloons that go to 100,000 feet and then come back down.
那些是非常大的气球，可以升到10万英尺高空，然后再返回地面。

The first one was on CNN. We did it during the solar eclipse.
第一次发射登上了CNN。我们在日食期间进行了那次活动。

And I think it's fun to see it actually working.
我认为看到它真正运作起来很有趣。

My friends, they know I have this spirit, so they weren't that surprised.
我的朋友们，他们知道我有这种精神，所以他们并没有那么惊讶。

And I think my family is the same; they know that I have this type of spirit.
我的家人也一样；他们知道我拥有这种精神。

So I think they weren't surprised when I launched it either. They were very excited and happy, and I don't know if they expected it to work.
所以我想，当我发布它时，他们也没有感到惊讶。他们非常兴奋和高兴，我也不确定他们是否预料到它会成功。

I had extracted all the users' emails from **Supabase** (Supabase: 一个开源的后端即服务平台) and sent an email to everyone, offering them a discount.
我从**Supabase**（Supabase: 一个开源的后端即服务平台）提取了所有用户的电子邮件，并向每个人发送了一封邮件，给他们提供了折扣。

I woke up to a response from one person saying the code wasn't working.
我醒来后收到了一封回复，有人说代码无法使用。

So I had to fix that glitch and I responded. Then I got the message from **Stripe** (Stripe: 一个在线支付处理平台): I got my first sale.
所以我不得不修复那个故障，然后我回复了。接着我收到了**Stripe**（Stripe: 一个在线支付处理平台）的消息：我有了我的第一笔销售。

It happened when I was walking downstairs.
这件事发生在我下楼的时候。

I was very excited. I told all my friends, family, and parents. I ran into my parents' room and was like, "Ah, I made it! Yay!"
我非常兴奋。我告诉了我所有的朋友、家人和父母。我冲进我父母的房间，喊道：“啊，我成功了！耶！”

### 年轻创业者的优势与挑战

So my experience has been good, I guess.
所以，我想我的经历一直都很好。

Of course, there are advantages, like when I posted the launch video, it did pretty well, and I bet my age was a factor in that.
当然，也有一些优势，比如当我发布启动视频时，它表现得相当不错，我敢打赌我的年龄是其中一个因素。

A lot of people are also more curious because I'm younger.
很多人也因为我更年轻而感到好奇。

So I think it opens up a lot more opportunities, like this interview, for example. I don't know if it would have happened if I were much older.
所以我想，这开启了更多机会，比如这次采访。我不知道如果我年纪大得多，这是否还会发生。

So a lot of opportunities open up when I'm younger.
所以，当我年轻时，很多机会都会随之而来。

For example, being part of **Founders Inc.** (Founders Inc.: 一个创业加速器或社区) is also a very big accomplishment.
例如，成为**Founders Inc.**（Founders Inc.: 一个创业加速器或社区）的一员也是一个非常大的成就。

I'm the youngest accepted there.
我是那里被接受的最年轻的人。

I was also invited to a summit in Paris, one of the top AI summits. That was something that happened due to these opportunities.
我还受邀参加了巴黎的一个峰会，那是顶级人工智能峰会之一。这些都是因此带来的机遇。

And the disadvantages are probably that it's also hard to get people to trust you.
而缺点可能是，也很难让人信任你。

So, despite the advantages, some people don't really trust me, for example.
所以，尽管有这些优势，但有些人，例如，并不真正信任我。

And I guess, as I mentioned earlier, recruiting is really hard when you're much younger because I have no capital, right?
而且我想，正如我之前提到的，当你非常年轻时，招聘人才真的很难，因为我没有资金，对吧？

I guess, just my birthday money, right?
我想，就只有我的生日钱，对吧？

So I think that was the hardest part.
所以我认为那是最困难的部分。

It took a couple of months before I could recruit two developers and one person who helps with strategy.
我花了几个月时间才招募到两名开发者和一名负责战略协助的人。

They actually reached out to me first, all three of them.
实际上，他们三个人都是主动联系我的。

They all reached out saying they were interested and would love to help.
他们都表示有兴趣并且很乐意提供帮助。

I reached out to a lot of adults, mentors, and all types of people for help, and many of them did help.
我联系了许多成年人、导师以及各种各样的人寻求帮助，他们中的许多人都提供了帮助。

So I think I have to give back to everyone, not just them, but everyone.
所以我认为我必须回馈每一个人，不只是他们，而是所有人。

### AI在学校的普及与未来展望

We're all interested in AI; we all use AI on a daily basis at school.
我们都对人工智能很感兴趣；我们每天在学校都会使用人工智能。

I think not only my friends, but everyone at school, all the kids now use AI.
我想，不仅是我的朋友，学校里的每个人，所有的孩子现在都使用人工智能。

So I think we're all interested in it, in terms of my friends and the school.
所以我想，就我的朋友和学校而言，我们都对它很感兴趣。

There are a lot of AI tools available, but I really think we only use one main one, which is ChatGPT.
有很多人工智能工具可用，但我真的认为我们只使用一个主要的，那就是ChatGPT。

I think a lot of kids at school don't know about the other tools, and I think you have to be more involved in AI to know them.
我认为学校里很多孩子不知道其他工具，而且我认为你必须更深入地参与人工智能才能了解其他工具。

So, I think most of the school, or the kids, or my friends are using ChatGPT only, which is unfortunate.
所以，我认为学校里的大部分人，或者说孩子们，或者我的朋友们，都只使用ChatGPT，这很不幸。

Only recently did I truly learn in depth about AI and how it works. The idea for Flow came when I realized there was a big gap and something that wasn't being done: automated tasks.
直到最近，我才真正深入了解人工智能及其运作方式。Flow的想法产生于我意识到存在一个巨大空白，即有一些事情尚未完成：自动化任务。

I think it can really help humans with efficiency.
我认为它确实能帮助人类提高效率。

Like my parents, for example, we all waste time filling out forms.
就像我的父母一样，我们都在填写表格上浪费时间。

But I think that's the biggest one because there aren't many platforms doing that; for example, **Claude** (Claude: 一种由Anthropic开发的大型语言模型) doesn't do that, nor does **OpenAI** (OpenAI: 一家致力于开发和推广友好AI的美国人工智能研究实验室).
但我认为这是最大的一个问题，因为没有多少平台在做这件事；例如，**Claude**（Claude: 一种由Anthropic开发的大型语言模型）不做，**OpenAI**（OpenAI: 一家致力于开发和推广友好AI的美国人工智能研究实验室）也不做。

I think that's the biggest gap there is: browser automation.
我认为这是现存最大的空白：浏览器自动化。

### Flow AI的愿景与长期目标

So, in general, I hope to have many more features in Flow by next year, and I hope for it to be smoother, of course, because there are still many bugs that will be fixed over time. And I think, in terms of the financial aspect...
所以，总的来说，我希望到明年Flow能有更多功能，当然也希望它能更流畅，因为仍然有许多错误会随着时间得到修复。而且我认为，就财务方面而言...

I set a goal on Twitter for $10,000 in **monthly recurring revenue (MRR)** (每月经常性收入: 企业每月从订阅或服务中获得的持续性收入), and it might take plenty of years.
我在Twitter上设定了一个目标，要达到10,000美元的**每月经常性收入（MRR）**（每月经常性收入: 企业每月从订阅或服务中获得的持续性收入），这可能需要很多年。

I'm not sure how long it will take, but I hope in a year we can get somewhere close to that.
我不确定这会需要多长时间，但我希望在一年内我们能接近这个目标。

So I hope Flow is able to become part of almost everyone's life.
所以我希望Flow能够融入到几乎每个人的生活中。

I think the goal is that tasks that can be automated will be.
我认为目标是，那些可以自动化的任务都将实现自动化。

We get to see how AI evolves and that kind of stuff. I think the long-term goal for me is, in some way, to help people and give back.
我们将会看到人工智能如何发展以及类似的事情。我认为我的长期目标是，在某种程度上帮助人们，并回馈社会。
