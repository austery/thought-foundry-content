### “Doge”计划：一场由梗图驱动的政府改革闹剧

“Doge”（Government Efficiency）计划本意是削减联邦开支，却最终演变成一场由网络迷因驱动、数据造假和政治表演构成的灾难性失败。它不仅未能实现承诺的2万亿美元削减目标，反而在短短一年内导致政府支出增加、监管体系崩塌，并严重损害了美国的软实力。

<p class="english-text">In the world of finance, a write-off is a polite way to describe a massive investment that incinerated capital with nothing left to show for it but a tax deduction and a lesson learned. In Washington DC, however, it appears that they call it the Department of Government Efficiency. Elon Musk finally offered a candid post-mortem on his brief but chaotic tenure as the spiritual leader of the department.</p>
</details>

### 从“办公室空间”迷因到现实灾难

Musk在Doge计划启动初期，曾发布一张将自己与联合负责人Vivec比作电影《办公室空间》中“Bob兄弟”的表情包。这两位顾问是典型的官僚荒诞派象征——只会使用术语，不懂一线员工的工作内容，并最终解雇了有能力的工程师，提拔了擅长玩政治游戏的人。这一举动本应是黑色幽默，却意外地成了预言。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Shortly after the department was announced, he posted a meme on his everything app depicting himself and his co-head Vivec as the Bobs, the two consultants from the cult classic film Office Space. For those who haven't seen the movie, the Bobs are brought into a poorly managed software company called Initech to streamline operations. They are the embodiment of sterile corporate absurdity. They speak in buzzwords. They've no understanding of what the employees actually do and they ultimately fire the wrong people like the competent software engineers while promoting the incompetent ones who simply know how to play the corporate game. Comparing your new government department to a pair of fictional consultants famous for being useless antagonists was certainly a choice. And as it turns out, it was a prophetic one.</p>

### 财政数据的真相：支出不降反升

尽管Doge高调宣布将削减数万亿美元，但《经济学人》通过对美国财政部每日资金支出报告（DTS）的分析发现，在新政府上任前三周，联邦日均支出高达300亿美元——与前一年同期相比不仅未下降，反而上升。财政数据从不关心新闻稿或宣传口号，只记录实际流出的资金。

<details>

<p class="english-text">The Economist's data team was doing something far less exciting, but far more revealing. They were reading the daily Treasury statements or DTS. The DTS is effectively the federal government's daily checking account statement. Every working day, the Treasury publishes a detailed list of cash withdrawals from its primary deposit account. It doesn't care about press releases, ceiling values, or projected savings. It only cares about cash out the door. The Economist found that in the first three weeks of the new administration, despite the announcements of massive savings, federal outlays averaged $30 billion a day. When compared to the same period the prior year, spending hadn't fallen. It had actually risen.</p>
</details>

### “天花板价值”骗局：用理论数字冒充实际节省

Doge的“节约”计算方法建立在一种政府采购术语——“天花板价值”（ceiling value）上，即合同的理论最高支出上限。当他们取消一项合同，不是按实际已支付金额计算节省，而是用“如果全花完能花多少钱”来宣称成果。例如，他们声称因取消一个移民儿童庇护所合同节省了29亿美元——但该设施已空置一年，实际仅需支付小额保留费。最终实际节省仅为宣传数字的4%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Investigations by Politico and Futurism revealed that Doge was using a metric known in government procurement, a ceiling value, to calculate its wins. When they cancelled a government contract, they didn't count the amount of money actually being spent. They counted the maximum theoretical amount that could have been spent over the lifetime of the deal. One of the more egregious examples was a shelter for migrant children. Doge claimed a savings of $2.9 billion for cancelling this contract. In reality, the shelter had been empty for a year. The agency was only paying a small retainer to keep the facility on standby. The actual cash savings from cancelling the contract was only about 4% of the headline figure.</p>

### 消灭监管者，却让自家企业逃脱审查

Doge不仅未能削减政府支出，反而系统性削弱了监管机构。它推动大幅裁减美国联邦航空管理局（FAA）和国家公路交通安全管理局（NHTSA）的预算——这两个机构本应监管SpaceX火箭发射和Tesla自动驾驶软件。同时，Musk旗下的Starlink卫星互联网服务却在混乱中安然无恙，甚至借机推动将自家AI技术整合进联邦系统核心。这暴露了明显的利益冲突。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Doge pushed for deep cuts at the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. These are the specific regulators responsible for overseeing SpaceX rocket launches and Tesla's self-driving software. By cutting the budgets of these government watchdogs, Musk effectively removed the oversight that had been slowing down his own product testing. Then there's the matter of his other ventures. While Musk was slashing the budgets of rival government contractors, questions arose about how his own satellite internet company Starlink seemed to navigate the chaos unscathed. Critics noted that while legacy providers faced the wood chipper, Musk's companies were positioned to pick up the pieces with his team pushing to integrate private AI solutions presumably modeled on his own technology into the heart of the federal stack. It appears that in the rush to delete government waste, the department also managed to delete a significant amount of regulatory risk for its spiritual leader.</p>

### 战略误判：联邦预算并非“可自由支配的基金”

Doge声称能削减2万亿美元，但这是完全脱离现实的幻想。美国联邦预算中约65%是强制性支出（社保、医保、医疗补助），10%用于偿还国债利息，仅剩25%为可自由支配支出——其中一半又属于国防预算。在特朗普政府承诺增加军费的情况下，Musk实际上是在试图从仅约9000亿美元的非国防可支配预算中削减2万亿美元——即使关闭所有国家公园、交通管制和司法部，也无法达成目标。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The claim that Doge could cut $2 trillion from the federal budget was not just ambitious. It was to use a technical economic term ridiculous. As we discussed in a prior video on this topic, the US federal budget is not a discretionary slush fund. Roughly 65% of all spending is mandatory, meaning that it is locked in by law for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Another 10% is interest on the national debt, which has to be paid unless the US wants to default and trigger a global financial crisis. That leaves just 25% for discretionary spending and half of that goes to the Pentagon. Since the Trump administration had vowed to increase defense spending, Musk was effectively promising to cut $2 trillion out of a non-defense discretionary budget that only contained about $900 billion to begin with. He could have fired every park ranger, air traffic controller, and FBI agent, shut down the Department of Justice, and turned off the lights in the White House, and he still would have missed his target by a trillion dollars.</p>

### 人员削减的反效果：留下最差，赶走最优

Doge向员工发放“带薪离职”补偿金，本意是激励效率，却导致最有能力、最容易找到新工作的员工主动离职，留下的是缺乏外部机会的低绩效人员。这不仅降低了政府效率，还使公共服务质量进一步恶化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Possibly the most foolish thing that Doge did was to send mass emails to staff offering paid redundancy. Such an offer will be accepted by the best workers who could easily find work elsewhere, leaving the government staffed by the people who have no other outside opportunities.</p>
</details>

### 软实力崩塌：削减对外援助的灾难性后果

Doge通过行政命令直接解散美国国际开发署（USAID），切断其合同和人员，造成严重外交后果。尽管官方声称此举是为了节省资金，但实际动机是回应网络传言——错误地指控USAID向加沙地带运送“5000万美元的避孕套”。事实上，该资金用于莫桑比克的HIV预防项目。这一错误导致美国在全球的形象严重受损。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The dismantling of US aid targeted its global reach. This was the one area where Doge truly succeeded in slashing a department, feeding it, in Musk's own words, into the wood chipper. Because US aid was created by Congress, Doge lacked the legal authority to abolish it. Instead, they used executive power to fire its staff and cancel its contracts, effectively closing it by fiat. Interestingly, while this move horrified foreign policy experts, it was a political winner at home. The Financial Times reported that the gutting of foreign aid enjoyed broad support among voters, many of whom were reacting to viral claims from Musk, that the agency was sending $50 million in condoms to Hamas. As it turns out, the efficiency experts at Doge had confused the Gaza Strip with the Gaza province in Mozambique, where the US funds HIV prevention programs. US A had sent zero condoms to the Gaza Strip, but the correction came too late and the agency was already in the wood chipper. The geopolitical cost associated with these savings may be steep. Bill Gates told the FT that the picture of the world's richest man killing the world's poorest children is not a pretty one. Even Marco Rubio, the Secretary of State, testified to Congress that the debt toll from these abrupt cuts was surely not zero.</p>
</details>

### 系统性失败：Doge根本不是“政府机构”

尽管拥有官方名称和总统印章，但Doge从未是合法设立的政府部门。只有国会才能创建新部门，而国会并未通过任何相关法案。Doge本质上是一个“顾问委员会”，但Musk却用行政命令和恐吓取代了传统的咨询报告。他不是提出建议，而是直接解雇公务员、锁门关门——这是“企业掠夺者”的行为，而非企业管理。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Despite the official sounding name and the presidential seal on the podium, the Department of Government Efficiency was not a real government department. Only Congress can create new departments and Congress did no such thing. Legally, Doge was an advisory committee. This concept is nothing new. In 1905, Theodore Roosevelt established the Keep Commission to reform the executive branch. In 1984, Ronald Reagan appointed the industrialist J. Peter Grace to lead the Grace Commission, which famously concluded that one-third of all income taxes were consumed by waste. Historically, these commissions follow a polite, predictable script. A group of business leaders spends a year writing a thick report. The president thanks them for their service, and the report is promptly filed in a basement, never to be seen again. Musk, however, had little interest in writing reports. While the legal setup suggested he was merely a consultant offering advice, the reality on the ground was very different. Consultants usually produced PowerPoint decks. Musk produced termination notices through a combination of executive orders and sheer administrative bullying. Musk's team bypassed the usual separation of powers. They didn't just suggest that the IRS should be leaner. They fired the staff. They didn't just recommend that US aid be reformed. They cancelled its contracts and locked the doors. In the past, the business approach to government meant bringing in a CEO to just look at the books. This time, it meant bringing in a corporate raider to strip the assets.</p>

### 成本远超收益：净损失高达1350亿美元

据公共服务机构（Partnership for Public Service）估算，Doge计划造成的总成本——包括支付给被暂停员工的带薪休假、重新雇佣错误解雇人员的成本以及生产力损失——可能高达1350亿美元。而它宣称的“节省”全无实际财务依据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">CBS Money Watch reported an estimate from the Partnership for Public Service suggesting that Doge's disruptions, including paid leave for suspended workers, the costs of rehiring wrongfully terminated staff and lost productivity, may have actually cost taxpayers roughly $135 billion.</p>
</details>

### 真正有效的改革工具：《虚假申报法案》

美国早已存在一套行之有效、低成本且合法的反欺诈机制——《虚假申报法案》（False Claims Act）。该法允许“举报人”起诉欺诈政府的公司，并可获得追回资金的一部分作为奖励。这套机制激励私人参与监督，无需大张旗鼓的“高管冲锋”，只需律师和电子表格。它高效、合法、缓慢——而这正是政治表演所厌恶的。

<p class="english-text">There is possibly a broader cultural lesson to be learned here. For the better part of a decade, markets and politics have been dominated by lols. The idea that irony, memes, and sheer audacity could override fundamentals. We saw it in Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency. We saw it in the meme stock mania. And we saw it in the creation of a government department named after a Sheba Enu meme. >> I think the funniest name is is DOG, the the Doge Department of Governor Efficiency. >> As the Financial Times columnist Jamai noted recently, the joke just isn't funny anymore. When the LS meet the bond market, the bond market usually wins. The 10-year Treasury yield does not care about your mean game. It cares about the debt to GDP ratio, and that ratio is not improving. In his final days, as the shadow efficiencies are, Musk was asked if the project could survive without him. He replied with a cone. Is Buddha needed for Buddhism? It is a lofty comparison, but perhaps a more fitting question for the bond vigilantes watching the US debt pile grow is this. Is a calculator needed for accounting? The answer, it turns out, is yes. And for now, the calculator says that despite all the memes, the US government is still spending $30 billion a day.

### 债务与利息：效率幻觉的终极代价

Doge计划失败的核心代价，是它加速了美国国债利息支出的增长。联邦政府年均利息支出已接近1万亿美元，这笔钱不用于建设道路、飞机或医疗系统——它只是为过去的债务付账。当政府支出增加、税收减少，就必须借更多钱——而Doge不仅没有削减赤字，反而让这一“死钱”支出加速膨胀。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In the absence of spending cuts, the administration has pivoted to its favorite revenue raising tool, tariffs. The government collected 195 billion in custom duties in full year 2025, a massive increase from the previous year. Supporters claim that this windfall will pay down the national debt. The problem is that even with this historic surge, tariff revenue covers less than 3% of total federal spending. And worse still, the revenue stream may be temporary. The Supreme Court is currently hearing a challenge to the constitutionality of using emergency powers to impose these sweeping tariffs. During oral arguments in November, several justices appeared skeptical of the president's authority to bypass Congress on trade taxes. If the court rules against the administration, the Treasury could be forced to refund up to $168 billion to businesses. This would blow an even larger hole in the budget, leaving the government with higher spending, lower revenue, and a Manhattan project that produced nothing but a puff of smoke.</p>

### 最终的讽刺：Musk承认失败

在与Katie Miller的访谈中，Musk终于松口：“我不会再这么做一次了。”他补充道：“与其做Doge，不如专注经营我的公司。”这句话揭示了这场“政府改革”的本质：它从来不是为了削减浪费，而是为个人商业利益铺路的一场政治秀。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">In his interview with Katie Miller, Musk attempted to frame the venture as having been somewhat successful, claiming that Doge had identified $200 billion in zombie payments. But the Treasury's ledger paints a very different picture. If Doge truly stopped $200 billion of waste, those savings were immediately consumed and exceeded by new spending. To call a project that presided over a net increase in federal outlays somewhat successful is a bit like the captain of the Titanic describing his voyage as a partial success because the band played beautifully until the end. Perhaps the most revealing moment of the podcast came when Musk let his guard down. When asked if he would do it all over again, he replied, "I don't think so." He added almost wistfully, "Instead of doing Doge, I would have basically worked on my companies."</p>
