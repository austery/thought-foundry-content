title: 民主党温和派参议员为何支持国土安全部停摆：对ICE执法过度与移民政策的批判
summary: 本次访谈深入探讨了内华达州参议员**凯瑟琳·科尔特斯·马斯托**作为民主党温和派，为何出人意料地支持针对**国土安全部 (DHS)**的政府停摆。她从自身执法背景出发，严厉批评**特朗普**政府下**移民及海关执法局 (ICE)**的移民执法行为，指出其过度执法、缺乏搜查令、针对和平抗议者及地方执法人员家属等问题。马斯托主张将ICE的部分资金转拨给地方执法机构，并推行常识性改革，认为此次停摆是一场必要的政治斗争，旨在追究政府责任并倡导平衡的移民政策。

### 国土安全部停摆与温和派立场

**Michael Barbaro**: 大家好，我是《**纽约时报**》的**迈克尔·巴巴罗**。这里是《The Daily》。今天是一个不同寻常的政府停摆的第六天，民主党人扣留了对一个联邦机构——**国土安全部 (Department of Homeland Security)**的拨款，以迫使**特朗普**总统改变其数千名特工执行移民法律的方式。今天，我将与一位民主党策略中出人意料的领导者——内华达州参议员**凯瑟琳·科尔特斯·马斯托**进行对话。今天是2月19日，星期四。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: From **New York Times**, I'm **Michael Barbaro**. This is The Daily. Today marks the sixth day of an unusual government shutdown in which Democrats have withheld funding to a single federal agency, the **Department of Homeland Security**, in order to force President **Trump** to change how thousands of its agents enforce immigration laws. Today, my conversation with an unlikely leader of the Democratic strategy, Senator **Katherine Cortez Masto** of Nevada. It's Thursday, February 19th.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 参议员。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: Senator,

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 您好，您好吗？早上好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: Hello. How are you? Good morning.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 我是**迈克尔·巴巴罗**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: It's **Michael Barbaro**.

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: **迈克尔**，我认得这个声音。您好吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: **Michael**, how I recognize a voice. How are you?

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 哦，这真让人受宠若惊。谢谢您抽出时间。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: Oh, that's flattering. Thank you for making time for us.

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 嗯，谢谢您。我很感谢有这个机会与您交谈。顺便说一句，谢谢您做出的出色报道。说真的，这很重要。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: Well, thank you. I appreciate the opportunity to talk with you and by the way, thank you for the great reporting you do. Seriously, it's important. Yeah.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 我们说话的时候，您在内华达州，对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: You are, as we speak, in Nevada, correct?

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 不在华盛顿特区，因为国会正在一个有点不合时宜的休会期。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: Not in Washington DC because Congress is on a somewhat illtimed recess.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: That's right.

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 我说不合时宜，是因为我们正处于部分政府停摆之中。我想谈谈您在其中的角色。参议员，我们倾向于认为，那些成为政府停摆的代表人物，或者其中一个代表人物的立法者，是某种特定类型的立法者——煽动者、鼓动者，随便您怎么形容。而您显然不是那样的人。这公平吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: And I said illtimed because we're in the middle of a partial government shutdown. And I want to talk about your role in that. We tend, Senator, to think of the lawmakers who become the face of a government shutdown or one of the faces of it as a particular kind of lawmaker, a fire brand, a rabble rouser, pick your adjective. You are pretty distinctly not that. Does that seem fair? I

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 我同意我是一个温和派。对我来说，温和派是那些努力把事情做好的人，对吧？他们以两党合作的方式工作，认为良好的政府很重要，我们仍然必须共同努力完成我们的工作。我们仍然必须为美国公众服务，无论是在我们居住的州还是在全国各地。我认为大多数人，至少当我在我的州时，他们都期望如此。他们期望您不仅为他们工作，而且以两党合作的方式工作。但他们也知道，有些时候，我认为站出来，挑起这场斗争，并说“不，这是一场我将非常直言不讳的战斗。这是一场我将站出来说这不能发生”是可以的。您会看到，我做过这样的事，您也会看到全国各地许多温和派人士做同样的事情。上次政府停摆时，您是反对的。我想您投了大约15次反对票。所以我倾向于不认为您是一个支持停摆的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: I would agree that I'm a moderate. That's to me those are the moderates are are people who are working to get things done, right? Who work in a bipartisan way who think that good government is important that we still have to work together to do our jobs. We still have to deliver for the American public whether it's in our state where we live or across the country. And I think most people, at least when I'm in my state, they expect that. They expect you to not only work on their behalf, but work in a bipartisan way. But they also know that there are times and I think it's okay to be out there and pick that fight and say no, this is a battle I'm going to be very vocal about. This is one I am going to stand up and say this can occur. And you see that not I've done that and you will see that for many moderates across the country doing the same thing. Well, the last time there was a government shutdown, you opposed it. I think you voted against it something like 15 times. And so I don't tend to think of you as a shutdown person.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 我明白您的意思。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: I see what you're saying. Yeah. So, let

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 是的，让我这样说。对我来说，指责一个伤害我们社区、挑战我们基本规范的政府，无论您属于哪个党派，都没有错，特别是在这种情况下，围绕着法律和秩序。他们需要被挑战，需要被指责。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: me just say this. For me, there's nothing wrong with calling out an administration, I don't care what party you are, that's hurting our community, that is challenging our very norms, particularly around, in this case, law and order. They need to be challenged and they need to be called out.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 嗯，这就是我们想谈的，您是如何走到这一步，决定支持扣留**国土安全部**的资金。我认为您参与这项努力很突出，因为您有执法背景。您是该州的前司法部长。您与执法部门有着非常牢固的关系，我相信我们将在这次对话中谈到这一点。**国土安全部**是一个主要的执法机构，而您决定扣留其资金，原因是它处理移民执法的方式。我想谈谈，鉴于您的背景，您是如何走到这一步的。那么，请告诉我们这个故事。它在过去一年左右的时间里是如何开始的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: Well, that's what we want to talk about, how you got to this point where you decided to support withholding funding from the **Department of Homeland Security**. And I think it stands out that you have joined this effort because of your background in law enforcement. You're a former attorney general in the state. You have very strong set of relationships with law enforcement, which I'm sure we're going to be talking about in this conversation. **DHS**, the **Department of Homeland Security** is a major law enforcement agency and you have decided that funding should be withheld from it over the way it has approached immigration enforcement and I want to talk about how given your background you got to that point. So tell us that story. Where does it begin over the past year or so?

</details>

### 移民执法问题与资金分配

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 让我先给您一些背景。大多数人不知道，我的大部分职业生涯都在执法部门。说实话，当**国土安全部**成立时，我正在华盛顿特区的美国检察官办公室担任联邦检察官，我的丈夫是一名特勤局特工。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: So let me give you some background. Most people don't know. Most of my career has been in law enforcement. Quite honestly when **Homeland Security** was created I was working in the **US Attorney's Office** in Washington DC as a federal prosecutor and my husband was a **Secret Service** agent.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 哇。所以你们俩都在执法部门工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: Wow. So you're both in law enforcement.

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 没错。我继续这项工作。后来成为内华达州的司法部长，做了八年。我的整个职业生涯都与执法部门和检察官合作，了解我们在维护社区安全、围绕社区警务方面所努力实现的益处和目标。如果您是一个有效的执法机构，您就会深入社区并建立公众信任。这就是它的意义所在。您想追捕暴力罪犯，您想让他们承担责任，但您也想保护个人的宪法权利，因为这是为了维护社区安全。现在这个政府上台了，共和党人在他们的税收法案中给了他们所有这些钱。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: That's right. And I continued that work. Became attorney general here in the state of Nevada. Did that for eight years. Worked with law enforcement, with prosecutors my entire career and understand the benefits and what we are trying to achieve when we keep our community safe around community policing. If you're effective law enforcement agency, you're going to get in the community and build that public trust. That's what it's about. You want to go after the violent criminals. You want to hold them accountable, but you also want to protect individuals constitutional rights because it's about keeping your community safe. Now comes along this administration and they have all of this money the Republicans have given them in their tax bill,

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 对吗？他称之为“一个宏伟美丽的法案”。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: Right? The one big beautiful bill as he calls it. Yep.

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: “一个宏伟美丽的法案”。共和党人总共给了他们大约**1700亿美元**，其中**750亿美元**给了**移民及海关执法局 (ICE)**，而**ICE**的正常年度预算大约在**80亿到100亿美元**之间。没有附加条件。没有附加条件。我们现在看到的是，因为他们有这么多钱，而且因为**史蒂文·米勒 (Steven Miller)**给他们设定了每天**3000次**移民驱逐和拘留的配额，他们开始招募任何能为**ICE**工作的人，对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: The one big beautiful bill. Republicans give them about **$170 billion** altogether and that's **$75 billion** going to **ICE** which the normal annual budget for **ICE** is anywhere about **8 to 10 billion**. There's no strings attached. No strings attached. And what we are seeing now is because they have all this money and because they had this quota from **Steven Miller** to do **3,000** immigration deportations and detainments a day, they started onboarding whoever they could to work at **ICE**, right?

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 他们不仅招募得非常快，还降低了招聘标准，并减少了大多数执法人员在进行社区警务时所接受的培训。对吗？降级标准、武力使用标准，这些都没有。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: And not only were they onboarding them very quickly, they lowered their standards for hiring them and they decreased the training that most law enforcement go through as they're looking to do community policing. Right? Deescalation standards, use of force standards, none of that.

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 所以，您只是因为认识到突然出现了招聘狂潮，标准正在改变，而且您认为培训不足，就感到不安。这发生在几个月前。所以，这是您的第一批担忧。这些担忧是如何随着时间演变的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: So, you become unsettled just from recognizing that there's a sudden hiring binge and that the standards are changing and that the training in your mind is insufficient. This is back many months ago. So, that's your first set of concerns. How do those evolve over time?

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 后来，正如我们在社区中看到的，这个政府不幸地不关心公共安全。尽管**唐纳德·特朗普**一直在谈论追捕暴力罪犯，听着，我认为我们所有人，社区中的每个人，无论您住在哪里，都希望暴力罪犯离开您的社区。您希望您的社区安全。您希望知道当您拨打911并有担忧时，警察会响应。他们会保护您的安全，尊重您的权利，但会追捕那些暴力罪犯。然而，我们看到的恰恰相反。现在他们向我们的社区派遣了通常不分配在这些社区的特工。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: So then as we are seeing in communities, this administration unfortunately wasn't about public safety. Even though **Donald Trump** was talking about going after violent criminals, which listen, I think we all, everybody in the community, I don't care where you live, you want violent criminals out of your communities. You want your community safe. You want to know that when you call 911 and you have concerns, police officers are going to respond. They're going to keep you safe, respect your rights, but go after those violent criminals. What we were seeing, however, is just the opposite. Now they're sending in to our communities numbers of agents that normally were not assigned in those communities.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 这种过度使用武力的驱逐部队，他们进入社区，只是进行我们以前从未见过的巡逻。他们敲门。他们甚至不敲门。一半时间他们没有司法搜查令就闯入。他们把人从车里拉出来。他们跟踪人，我知道这一点，因为这发生在**拉斯维加斯**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: This deportation force of excessive force and they are coming into communities and they are just roving patrols which we've never seen before. Roving patrols. They are knocking on doors. They are not even knocking. Half the time they're going in and without a judicial warrant. They're pulling people out of their cars. They are following people, I know this because this happened in **Las Vegas**,

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 跟踪戴着面具的人从教堂回家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: following people with masks home from church.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 在您的州，跟踪人们从教堂回家。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: Following people home from church in your state,

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 在我的州，从教堂回家。我一直与执法部门沟通。我还知道，在这段时间里，他们实际上追捕了我的一些地方执法警察，追捕了他们的家人并威胁他们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: home from church in my state. And I talk to law enforcement all the time. I also know that during this period of time they actually went after some of my local law enforcement police officers went after their families and threatened.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 我想慢下来理解这一点。您发现了证据，表明移民执法人员正在追捕地方执法人员的家人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: I just want to slow down and understand this. You found evidence that immigration enforcement agents were pursuing the families of local law enforcement.

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 没错。没错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: Correct. Correct.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 是因为他们的移民身份吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: Was it because of their immigration status?

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 是因为他们的移民身份，他们在内华达州居住了很长时间。他们不是暴力罪犯，但他们一直在工作、纳税、抚养家庭，而他们却在追捕这些人。他们威胁这些执法人员的职业生涯，以及他们的家人。这告诉我他们已经失控了。这告诉我他们进入我们社区还有另一个原因。这并不是为了追捕最暴力的罪犯。这更加恶劣，虽然没有达到我们在**芝加哥**或**明尼阿波利斯**看到的程度，但它正在发生。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: It was because of their immigration status that they had been in Nevada for a long period of time. They were not violent criminals, but they had been working, paying taxes, raising their family, and they were going after these individuals. And they were threatening the careers of these law enforcement officers that their families. That tells me they're out of control. That tells me there is another reason why they're coming into our communities. It wasn't about going after the most the violent criminals. It was much more heinous and it was not at the level that we saw in **Chicago** or **Minneapolis**, but it is happening.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 您所描述的这一切都发生在**明尼阿波利斯**事件之前。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: And what you're describing, this is all happening before **Minneapolis**.

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 没错。然后我们看到了**明尼阿波利斯**发生的事情，当他们派遣那支警察部队时。这个政府想要创建一支国家警察部队，只是为了进入社区，施加暴力，恐吓民众，打着某种移民执法的幌子。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: That's correct. And then we see what plays out in **Minneapolis** when they send that police force in. A national police force that this administration wants to create to just come in and brutalize communities and scare people under the guise of some sort of immigration enforcement. And

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 一支施加暴力的国家警察部队，我的意思是，这些都是非常带有感情色彩的词语。我只是想确保我理解它们。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: a national police force that's brutalizing I mean that those are some very loaded phrases. I just want to make sure I'm understanding them.

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 是的。不，请您理解。因为我认为这绝对是正确的。他们正在追捕和平抗议者，杀害那些愤怒的和平抗议者，因为他们进入了他们的社区，实际上甚至没有追捕暴力罪犯，他们还在侵犯个人权利。他们正在拘留和驱逐美国公民。他们正在使用行政搜查令进入私人财产。他们侵犯了我们宪法的第一修正案、第二修正案、第四修正案、第五修正案和第十修正案。这就是这个政府正在做的事情。所以，是的，这需要采取行动。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: Yeah. No, please. Because I think that is absolutely correct. They are going after peaceful protesters. Killing peaceful protesters who are outraged that they're coming into their communities and actually not even going after violent criminals and they're violating individuals rights. They are detaining and deporting US citizens. They are using their administrative warrants to go into people's private properties. They have violated the first amendment, the second amendment, the fourth amendment, the fifth amendment, the 10th amendment of our constitution. That's what this administration is doing. So yes, it demands action.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 所以在您看来，鉴于您的执法背景，这不是执法部门应有的运作方式。在1月中旬，您对此采取了行动。您提出了一项关于**ICE**的立法，该法案将把我们正在谈论的、来自“一个宏伟美丽的法案”中指定用于**ICE**等机构的大部分资金，转拨给地方执法部门。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: And so in your mind, given your background in law enforcement, this is not how law enforcement is is supposed to be operating. And in mid January, you you do something about it. And you introduce a piece of legislation about **ICE** that would divert much of this money that we're talking about that came from the one big beautiful bill that was designated for things like **ICE** and divert it to local law enforcement.

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 他们有太多钱了，**ICE**有**750亿美元**。太多了。所以我们把它拿走吧。让我们把它转拨给地方执法部门和州执法部门，他们受过训练，知道如何在我们的社区工作，知道如何管理抗议活动，甚至如何在不侵犯宪法权利的情况下拦下某人的车。这和我社区里听到和看到的情况一样。和您在**明尼阿波利斯**警察局长那里听到的对话一样，对吧？这只是常识。我们让他上了节目。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: They have too much money that **$75 billion** in **ICE**. Too much. So let's take it away. Let's let's let's divert it to local law enforcement and state law enforcement who are trained to work in our communities, who know how to manage a protest or even pull somebody over in the car without violating their constitutional rights. It's the same I I hear it and see it in my community. Same conversation that you saw from the police chief in **Minneapolis** saying the same thing, right? It's just common sense. We had him on the show.

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 因为我也知道，通过与我的地方警察局长和警长合作和交谈，他们不仅人手不足，而且当这支驱逐部队进入他们的社区时，他们就会不堪重负。这其中一部分是，如果我们真的致力于维护社区安全，那么就让我们信任那些受过训练的机构来做这件事，对吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: because I also know working and talking to my local police chiefs and sheriffs that not only are they understaffed, but when when this deportation force comes into their communities, they are then overwhelmed. And part of this is if we are really working to keep our communities safe, let's trust those agencies that are trained to do it, right?

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 并从这些**ICE**特工那里拿走资金，他们显然不仅没有受过训练，他们也不在乎是否受训，他们也不在乎他们正在侵犯和伤害个人，甚至杀害他们。共和党人不接受您的这项提议，于是您和您的同事决定，鉴于此，必须采取其他措施。你们想出的办法是利用您的财政权力，您作为参议院少数党的作用，在一个支出法案中阻止对**国土安全部**的拨款，除非**国土安全部**内部进行一系列改革。我想快速总结一下你们要求进行的这些改革。您要求这些特工在逮捕或进入房屋或企业时必须有搜查令。您要求特工的身份证明必须可见。您要求他们不再戴面具。我想知道你们为什么决定，如果这些改革得不到满足，你们就会阻止**国土安全部**的拨款。你们是如何达成这种谈判策略的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: and take the money away from these **ICE** agents who clearly not only are not trained, they don't care to be trained and they don't care that they're violating and harming individuals and or killing them. And Republicans don't embrace this proposal you have and you and your colleagues decide that something else has to be done given that and what you all come up with is to use your power of the purse, your role as the minority in the Senate to hold up funding for **DHS** in a spending bill unless you get a series of reforms within **DHS**. Pass. And I want to quickly summarize those reforms that you all ask for. You ask for there to be warrants when these agents come to make arrests or to go to a house or a business. You ask that agents IDs be visible. You ask that they no longer wear masks. And I wonder why you all decide that those are the reforms that if you don't get, you will hold up **DHS** funding. How you arrive at that negotiation tactic essentially?

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 是的，我可以非常清楚地告诉您，根据我与执法部门合作的背景，这些都是我们地方执法部门每天都在采用的常识性做法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: Yeah, I can tell you very clearly from my background in working with law enforcement, those are common sense practices that our local law enforcement engage in every day.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 为了维护我们社区的安全。这就是原因。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: to keep our community safe. That's why.

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 因此，我们在民主党的要求中制定了许多政策和协议，这些都只是我们地方执法部门和州警官已经在做的常识性政策。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: And so a lot of the the policies and protocols that we had developed in the Democratic asks were just common sense policies that our local law enforcement and and state officers were already doing.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 您现在也希望联邦移民特工使用这些政策。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: that you now want federal immigration agents to use as well.

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 没错。他们为什么不应该这样做呢？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: That's correct. Why shouldn't they?

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 所以上周晚些时候，由于政府和**国土安全部**没有批准您的任何请求，您和您的民主党参议员同事投票阻止了对该机构的拨款。您很清楚这一点，因为您谈到了上次因医疗保健问题而停摆。停摆会带来很多痛苦，很多意想不到的痛苦。工人拿不到工资，但他们很多人仍然不得不工作。所以服务变得紧张。就**国土安全部**而言，这意味着机场安检、**TSA**、网络安全、**FEMA**、海岸警卫队等服务。而你们都做出了一个决定，您知道这可能会造成一些痛苦。我想知道您为什么认为这样做是值得的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: So late last week, having not gotten any of these requests granted to you by the administration, by **DHS**, you and your Democratic colleagues in the Senate, you cast a vote to block funding to the agency. And you know this well because you talked about the previous shutdown over healthcare. Shutdowns involve a lot of pain, a lot of unintended pain. Workers don't get paid, but a lot of them have to work anyway. So services become strained. In the case of **DHS**, that means services like airport security, **TSA**, cyber security, **FEMA**, **Coast Guard**, and you all have made a decision that you know will probably cause some of that pain. And I want to know why you think it's worth it to do this.

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 如果我们不站出来反对这个政府在我们的社区中从事的这种无法无天的行为，那么我们还剩下什么？如果您推导出这个政府已经创建了自己的警察部队，他们由不遵循警察维护社区安全的正常协议的个人组成，而且他们正在做相反的事情，并且他们打着移民执法的幌子派遣他们出去，那么他们下一步会做什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: If we do not stand up against this lawlessness that we see this administration engaging in in our communities, then what is left for us? If you carry out to the logical conclusion that this administration has created their own police force, that they're made up of individuals who don't follow normal protocols that police follow to keep our communities safe, and they're doing just the opposite. And they're sending them out under the guise of immigration enforcement. What's next for them?

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 担忧是，下一步他们会把他们带到我们的选举过程中。他们会试图声称选举是——

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: And the concern is the next is they're going to bring them out around our election process. They're going to try to claim the election is

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 那就是您所担心的下一步。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: that's what you fear is next.

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 绝对是。这是您看到正在发生的逻辑结论。这个政府正在利用这支警察部队来执行其命令。听着，我从没想过我会看到联邦层面的移民特工，我过去曾与他们合作过，会从事他们现在正在做的这种暴行。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: Absolutely. It's the logical conclusion that you see happening. This administration is using this police force to do its bidding. Listen, I never thought that I would see the day where immigration agents that I worked with in the past at a federal level would be engaging in the brutality that they're doing now.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 好的，参议员，我们休息一下，回来后，我想讨论民主党人，包括您，在向公众解释这次停摆是什么和不是什么时可能面临的挑战。我们马上回来。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: Well, Senator, we're going to take a break and when we come back, I want to engage with the challenges that Democrats, including you, may face in explaining what this shutdown is and what it isn't to the public. We'll be right back.

</details>

### 移民政策的平衡与公众认知

**Michael Barbaro**: 参议员，我现在想谈谈您和您的政党在这次**国土安全部**停摆问题上所面临的一个根本性挑战。您已经明确表示，您认为这是一个关于什么是好的执法和什么不是好的执法的问题，而且目前移民执法行动对您来说代表着糟糕的执法。但对于相当一部分选民来说，这可能看起来是另一回事，那就是民主党人可能在移民问题上显得软弱。您对此如何回应？

<details>

**Michael Barbaro**: Senator, I want to turn now to a fundamental challenge for you and your party when it comes to this shutdown of **DHS**. You've made clear that you see this as a question of what good law enforcement is and what it isn't and that right now immigration enforcement operations represent bad law enforcement to you. But to some meaningful percentage of voters, this could end up looking like something else, which is potentially Democrats being weak on immigration. How do you respond to that?

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 嗯，我认为传统上我一直认为民主党在移民问题上是软弱的，在上一届政府下，我们已经看到了这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: Well, I think traditionally I have seen that the Democrats are weak on immigration under the last administration under we have seen that.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 完全，完全停止。我的意思是，您承认这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: full full stop. I mean, you're conceding that.

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 是的。嗯，绝对是。因为这对我来说一直是个挑战。我知道作为一个在这个领域工作过的人，我们可以两者兼顾。我们可以保卫我们的边境。我们可以解决边境正在发生的人口贩运、毒品贩运、武器贩运问题。我知道，因为作为司法部长，我曾处理过这些问题。我不是边境州，但我足够接近，可以与墨西哥的总检察长们合作处理这些问题。我们可以努力确保边境安全，为其提供资金，同时拥有一个尊重对待想要来到这个国家、遵守规则、为我们社区做出贡献、纳税和抚养家庭的人的移民程序。我们可以两者兼顾。但我看到民主党人回避了这一点。他们不谈论两者之间的平衡。我看到上一届**拜登**政府过于害怕谈论边境安全问题。所以对我来说，这只是常识。至少在内华达州，我认为全国大部分地区，人们都是这样想的。美国人并不愚蠢。他们能看到问题的两面，并且希望两面兼顾。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: Yeah. Well, absolutely. Because this has been my challenge. I know as somebody who has worked in this space, we can do both. We can secure our borders. We can address the human trafficking, the drug trafficking, weapons trafficking that's happening at the border. I know because as attorney general, I worked on it. I'm not a border state, but I'm close enough that I work with the Mexican AGs on these very issues. We can work to secure it, fund it, and at the same time have an immigration process that is treats people with respect, who want to come to this country, who have been playing by the rules, who have actually contributed to our communities and paying taxes and raising their families. We can do both. But I have seen Democrats shy away from that. They don't talk about the balance between the two. And I I watched as the last administration under **Biden** was too afraid to talk about securing the border. So it's just to me this is common sense. This is where most of the at least in Nevada and I see most of the country. This is how they think. Americans aren't stupid. They can see both sides of it and want both sides of it.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 但是，通过停止对负责移民执法（包括边境执法）的机构的资助，您如何避免给人留下这样的印象：您正在使这项工作变得更困难或效率更低？而您刚才也承认，民主党人在这方面并没有足够高的效率。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: But by defunding the agency that oversees immigration enforcement, including at the border, how do you avoid the perception that you are making that work, which as you just acknowledged, Democrats are not known for being effective enough at? How do you avoid making that work harder or and less effective?

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 所以我的要求是，我一直在和我的同事们讨论，这也是民主党人需要保持一致的地方，那就是我们并不是说要完全停止对**ICE**的资助。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: So what my ask is and what I've been talking about with my colleagues and this is where Democrats need to be aligned is that we are not saying completely defund **ICE**.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 我们说的是，按照他们传统的水平给他们提供资金，这样我们就能保卫我们的边境。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: What we are saying is fund them to the level they traditionally were so that we are securing our borders.

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 而且我们还在社区中与地方执法部门合作，在他们传统上拥有的移民管辖权下追捕暴力罪犯。所以，这并不是要停止对**ICE**或**CBP**的资助。这只是让我们给他们所需的资金，让他们在传统管辖权下运作，以帮助维护我们社区的安全，并与地方执法部门合作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: and we are also working in our communities with local law enforcement to go after the violent criminals under the immigration jurisdiction that they have that they've traditionally done. So, this isn't a defunding **ICE** or **CBP**. It's just let's give them the funding they need to actually operate under the traditional jurisdiction to help keep our communities safe and work with local law enforcement.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 对。您是说不要过度资助他们。但在您提出的论点中，您正在做出一个有趣的区分。您暗示许多选民希望并期望移民执法人员有某种行为，他们希望执法重点放在罪犯身上。我们在这个节目中与很多人谈过，从您所说来看，您也是听众之一，那些选民希望基于他们认为非法越境进入美国本身就是犯罪的事实，进行内部执法。那么，在您做出这些区分时，您是否在某种意义上潜在地制造了一种激励？民主党人一直被批评制造的这种激励，那就是您可以来到美国，您可以非法入境，然后您可以留下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: Right. And it's you're saying don't don't overfund them. But in making the argument you're making, you're you're drawing an interesting distinction. You're suggesting that many voters want and expect a certain conduct from immigration enforcement agents and that they want enforcement to be focused on criminals. We've talked to plenty of people on this show and from what you said, you're you're a listener, voters who want interior enforcement based on the fact that they believe illegally crossing the border into the US itself is a crime. And so in making the distinctions that you are, are you in a certain sense potentially creating an incentive? The incentive that that Democrats have been criticized for creating which is you can come to the United States, you can come illegally and you can stay.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 这不正是**特朗普**总统部分赢得选举的基础吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: and isn't that what President **Trump** won his election in part based on?

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 是的。不，让我在这里更明确一点。我确实认为国会在我们的移民法方面有其作用，对吧？是的，我们必须有一个人们来到这里的程序。是的，我们希望确保他们通过这个程序。国会未能履行其职责并更新法律，这正是我们应该做的。但让我说，**迈克尔**，人们总是拿这个问题玩弄政治。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: Yeah. No, here here let me just put a finer point on this. I do think there is a role for Congress when it comes to our immigration laws, right? Yes, we we have to have a process for people to come here. Yes, we want to make sure they move through that process. Congress has failed to do its job and update the laws and that's what we should be doing. But let me just say, **Michael**, people play politics with this all the time.

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 这对我来说是一个非常令人沮丧的问题。人们，共和党人，民主党人，对他们来说这都是政治。这与我们如何与那些想要努力工作、成为我们社区一部分、并已经证明了这一点并抚养家庭的个人一起推动我们的国家前进无关。我之所以成为美国参议员，是因为我的祖父来自墨西哥**奇瓦瓦州**，然后他在美国陆军服役并成为美国公民。现在，为什么我的故事会与任何其他来到这个国家并希望为他们的孩子和孙辈获得同样机会的人有所不同呢？这就是它的意义所在。但当**特朗普**政府和**史蒂文·米勒**决定所有移民都是可怕的、是强奸犯、是杀手，我们不希望任何移民在这里时，这是错误的。这违反了我们国家的法律和我们的身份。对我来说，这是国会的失败。这是我的共和党同事的失败，他们拒绝坐下来与我们合作解决这个问题，而是宁愿玩弄政治来赢得选举。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: and it is an issue to me that is so frustrating. People, Republicans, Democrats, it's all politics to them. It is not about how we move our country forward with individuals who want to work hard, be a part of our community, and have shown that and raise their families. I am a US senator because my grandfather came from **Chihuahua**, Mexico, and then he served in the **US Army** and became a **US citizen**. Now, why should my story be any different than any other person who comes to this country and wants the same opportunities for their for their kids and their grandchildren? That's what this is about. But when the **Trump** administration and **Steven Miller** decide that all immigrants are horrific and the rapists and they're killers and we don't want any immigrant here, that is wrong. And it goes against our laws in this country and who we are. And to me, this is a failing on Congress. This is a failing on my Republican colleagues who refuse to come to the table and work with us on to address this and instead would rather play politics with this to win elections.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 您对您在这里阐述的立场有多少信心，认为它代表了大多数美国人的观点？我之所以问这个问题，是因为我从新闻编辑室**华盛顿**分社的同事那里得到了一些内部消息，他们看到您向参议院民主党核心小组的一些同事分发了一份备忘录，其中指出有一种正确的方式来谈论这个问题，既要批评当前存在的移民执法，又要明确理解非法移民的问题以及在哪些方面需要非常严格的执法。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: How confident are you that the position you're articulating here is where most Americans are? And I asked that because I have some inside information from my colleagues in the newsroom in the **Washington** bureau who saw a memo that you circulated to some of your colleagues in the Democratic caucus of the Senate making the case that there is a right way to talk about this that involves both criticizing immigration enforcement as it currently exists while also establishing some firm understandings about what is wrong with illegal immigration and and where enforcement needs to be very tough.

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 是的，您说得对。我一直在作为我们所谓的“温和派小队”（mod squad），即温和派参议员的一部分工作，以确保我们来自的州，比如内华达州这样的摇摆州，那里居住着不同群体的人，包括在党派归属方面，民主党人、共和党人、无党派人士数量相当。这些人将决定民主党人能否控制参议院。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: Yeah, you're right. We I have been working as part of the what we call the mod squad, moderate senators to ensure that the states that we come from, which are swing states like Nevada, where there is a diverse group of people living there, including in in terms of party affiliation, Democrats, Republicans, nonpartisans in equal numbers. These are the the individuals that are going to make the difference in whether or not Democrats are going to be in control of the Senate. Mhm.

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 这就是我们赢回参议院的方式。如果我们想要吸引他们，与他们交谈，倾听他们，我们就必须了解他们关心什么。您提到的民意调查正是针对这些摇摆州及其选民的。您说得完全正确。他们想要安全的社区。但他们也要求对**ICE**所做的事情进行审查。他们不喜欢**ICE**的过度滥用。他们希望**ICE**专注于暴力罪犯。他们希望知道有人正在努力帮助他们的社区免受那些暴力罪犯，那些最坏的罪犯的侵害。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: That's how we win the Senate back. And if we are going to appeal to them and talk to them and listen to them, we have to understand what they care about. And the polling that you're referring to is a polling of just those swing states and who those voters are. And you're absolutely right. They want safe communities. But they also are demanding what they are seeing with **ICE**. They don't like the over excessive abuse of **ICE**. They want **ICE** to focus on the violent criminals. And they want to know that people are working to help keep their communities safe from those violent criminals, the worst of the worst.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 好的？所以，这项民意调查显示，选民希望一个有效率、遵守规则的**ICE**，但它能履行职责，特别是在拘留、驱逐非法入境的犯罪移民方面。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: Okay? So, they want an effective, this polling shows that voters want an effective **ICE** that follows the rules, but that does its job, particularly when it comes to detaining, deporting criminal immigrants who are here illegally.

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 没错。这就是我所说的，我们与他们的对话是：是的，我们必须让他们回到我们允许系统运作的时候，去追捕和找到那些最坏的、最暴力的个人。我们也要让人们对遵守我们的移民法负责。这是**ICE**和**CBP**的传统角色，这也是许多人想要和理解的。他们不希望看到眼前在电视上甚至在他们的社区中上演的景象。说实话，这就是他们出来抗议的原因。这就是他们发出声音的原因。这就是您看到他们走上街头的原因，他们不应该为此被杀害。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: That's right. And that's and that's what I say is is our conversation with them is yes, we've got to get them back to the time where we do this where we allow the system to work to go after and find individuals that are the worst of the worst, the most violent. We also hold people accountable to following our immigration laws. That is the traditional role of **ICE** and **CBP** and that's what many people want and understand. They do not want what they are seeing playing out in front of their very eyes on TV or even in their communities. And quite honestly, that's why they're coming out and protesting. That's why they're using their voices. That's why you see them out there and and they shouldn't be killed for it.

</details>

### 停摆的政治目标与未来展望

**Michael Barbaro**: 我想回到上次停摆作为参考点。您党派的领导人，比如参议员**查克·舒默 (Chuck Schumer)**，他们认为上次停摆，尽管您不支持，但听起来您从中吸取了一些宝贵的教训，那是一次政治胜利，因为它提升了医疗成本上升的问题，并将其归咎于共和党人。但即使作为一次政治胜利，它也没有导致政策改变。如果这次**国土安全部**的停摆也变成那样，一次信息传递上的胜利，却没有您所要求的政策改变，您会满意吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: I want to go back to the last shutdown as a point of reference. Leaders of your party like Senator **Chuck Schumer**, they believe that ultimately that shutdown, which you didn't support, but it sounds like you gained some valuable lessons from that that was a political victory in the way that it elevated the issue of rising healthcare costs and put it on Republicans. But even as a victory politically, it did not result in policy changes. If this shutdown of **DHS** becomes something like that, a messaging win without policy changes that you're asking for, would you be satisfied with that?

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 是的。因为原因如下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: Yes. Because here's why.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 您会满意。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: You would be

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 因为，原因如下。归根结底，这关乎一个失控的政府。如果他们甚至不愿意妥协或与我们合作解决美国公众对**ICE**机构的看法，他们不愿意与我们合作来约束他们，那么这个政府就有问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: because here here's why. At the end of the day, this is about an administration who is out of control. And if they are not willing to even compromise or work with us on addressing what the American public sees with this **ICE** agency, they're not willing to come to work with us to reign them in. There's a problem with that administration.

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 归根结底，我们对这个政府获得更多问责制的唯一方法是控制国会，是在这些选举中获胜，无论是在众议院还是参议院。我们有更多的监督作用。我们有更多的问责制。我们可以传唤他们。我们可以要求改变。我们对拨款有更多的控制权。现在，我们在这个国家看到的是，控制权的共和党人已经放弃了他们在国会的角色，听任这个政府的摆布，无论它想做什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: And the only way at the end of the day for us to get more accountability over this administration is to take control of Congress, is to win in these elections, whether it is in the House or the Senate. We have more oversight role. We have more accountability. We can call them in. We can demand change. We have more control over the appropriations. Right now, what we are seeing in this country is the Republicans in control have abdicated their role in Congress to this administration and doing whatever the bidding of this administration, whatever it wants to do.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 所以即使您没有赢得这些改革，您也可能赢得这场辩论。而赢得辩论可能意味着赢得选举。然后您就可以在您的设想中改变这个政府在移民执法方面的运作方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: So even if you don't win these reforms, you may win the argument. And winning the argument might then mean winning the election. And then you can in your mind change the way this administration operates when it comes to immigration enforcement.

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 这就是这个过程的运作方式。这就是我们作为美国人的身份。这就是它的意义所在。这就是这个国家。这值得为之奋斗。无论我们赢得政策辩论还是赢得信息战，归根结底，是我们作为一个国家是否获胜。当我们对这个政府向我们的社区派遣这些“暴徒”说“不”时，我们是否获胜？当我们通过选举和变革时，我们作为一个国家就能做到这一点。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: And that's how the process works. That's who who we are as Americans. That's what this is about. That's what this country is. And that's worth fighting for. Whether we win the policy debate or we win the messaging war, the end of the day, it's do we win as a country. Do we win when we say no more to this administration sending these thugs into our communities? And we can do that as a country when we elect and make change.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 假设您最终从政府那里得到您想要的东西。您最终会得到一些理解，即这些特工可能会摘下面具，他们会使用搜查令，并且在执行任务时会佩戴徽章表明身份。即使您从**ICE**和**边境巡逻队 (Border Patrol)**等机构那里得到了所有这些，考虑到他们过去的运作方式，考虑到总统的言论，考虑到您所描述的“令人发指”的行为——我的意思是，您称其中一些人为“暴徒”。即使您得到了这些改革，这些机构和特工还能让您信任吗？或者说，这里的问题比策略和行为要大得多？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: Let's say for a moment that you do end up getting what you want at some point from the administration. You do end up with some understanding that the masks might come off these agents, that they're going to be using warrants and they're going to be identifying themselves, with badges as they go about their work. Even if you get all that with agencies like **ICE** and with **Border Patrol**, given the way they have operated and given the rhetoric from the president, given the conduct that you have described as heinous, I mean, you've called some of these folks thugs. Even if you get these reforms, will these be agencies and agents that you can have faith in? Or is the problem here a lot bigger than tactics and conduct?

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 这是一个公平的问题，我认为这里的问题要大得多。当然，我们不仅希望这些改革，而且我们希望能够确保我们能够强制政府遵守这些改革，而我们过去已经看到这个政府缺乏信任。他们言行不一。所以这是一个有效的问题，我认为不仅是国会议员，而且美国公众都在努力解决这个问题，这也是他们要求民选领导人进行变革的原因，他们正在要求和指出他们所看到的问题。我认为这个政府在混乱和不确定性中茁壮成长，并不断改变目标。这就是这位总统过去成功的方式。他将继续以这种方式运作。但这并不是您治理国家的方式，也不是美国人民想要的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: That's a fair question and I think the the problem here is a lot bigger. Right. Of course, not only do we want these reforms, but we want to be able to ensure we can enforce the administration to follow these reforms and we have seen in the past a lack of trust from this administration. They say one thing and do another. So it is a valid point and it is something that I not just members of Congress but I think the American public are grappling with and why they are demanding change in the elected leaders and they're demanding and calling out what they are seeing. I think this administration thrives on chaos and uncertainty and constantly moving the goalposts. That's how this president has succeeded in the past. That's how he will continue to operate. But is not how you govern and is not what the American people want.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 参议员，如果政府真的不打算谈判，这次停摆将如何结束，或者它会一直持续到中期选举之后吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: Senator, how does the shutdown come to an end or does it not come to an end until after the midterms if the administration isn't really going to negotiate?

</details>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: 是的，我不知道途径。我不知道。**迈克尔**，我只能说，在此时此刻，我们要求的改变必须发生。我们不能再看到任何社区被这些无法无天的**ICE**特工和**CBP**在这个政府下施加暴力。我们就是不能。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Katherine Cortez Masto**: Yeah, I don't know the pathway. I I can't I don't know. **Michael**, I can only say at this moment in this time, the changes that we are demanding, it has to occur. We cannot see another community being brutalized by these lawless **ICE** agents and **CBP** under this administration. We just cannot.

</details>

**Michael Barbaro**: 好的，参议员，非常感谢您抽出时间。我们非常感谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Michael Barbaro**: Well, Senator, thank you very much for your time. We really appreciate it.
