### 探寻被遗忘的能源：柴火价格的300年历史

欢迎收听《Odd Lots》播客节目。主持人Tracy Alloway和Joe Weisenthal开场时提到，他们生活中一直缺少一份关于美国过去300年柴火价格的全面历史数据。

<p class="english-text">Hello and welcome to another episode of the Odd Thoughts podcast. I'm Tracy Aloway and I'm Joe Weisenthal. Joe, you know what's been missing in my life? Go on. Chickens. Oh yes, actually chickens still missing in my life, but also a comprehensive series of historical firewood prices in the US for the past 300 years.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal补充说，世界上几乎所有其他商品都有数据，唯独缺少柴火价格的300年时间序列，他总觉得如果有了这个数字，就能对大宗商品有更全面的了解。

<details>

<p class="english-text">You know what I we have data on literally every other commodity in the world, but I don't have a 300year time series on firewood prices. And I always feel like if I just had that number, then I would have the complete picture of commodities.</p>
</details>

虽然这听起来像玩笑，但实际上很重要，因为在18世纪或19世纪的美国，人们主要使用柴火，美国绝大部分的能源消耗都来自木材。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Well, I know we're sort of joking, but this is actually important because if you think about the US in the 1700s or the 1800s, people used firewood. The vast majority of America's energy consumption came from wood.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal提到，他最近在阅读《**白鲸记**》（Moby Dick: 美国作家赫尔曼·麦尔维尔创作的长篇小说，讲述捕鲸船“裴廓德”号船长亚哈追逐白鲸莫比·迪克的冒险故事），因此对19世纪的能源转型非常感兴趣。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Wait, do you remember a couple months ago when I was that guy who brought up wages of destruction in every chat? Are you going to do it again? No. Oh, well, you just did. No. Now I'm going to be the guy who brings up Moby Dick in every conversation because I've been reading Moby Dick and so I'm really interested in energy transitions in the 1800s.</p>
</details>

他指出，鲸油是唯一一种被我们完全淘汰的能源，而其他所有历史上的能源形式至今仍在使用，只是程度不同。因此，他非常关注过去的能源转型现象，并认为研究其他时期某种化石燃料或燃料形式“过时”或变得不经济的情况很有意思。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Because one of the things that uh you know has come up in some of our past conversations such as with Bob Brackett etc. Whale oil is basically the only energy source that we've completely eliminated. Every other historical energy source that we've had we still using it to some degree. They never totally disappear. And so I'm very interested in the phenomenon of like past historical energy transitions. People talk about the transition now, but it's interesting to sort of examine other periods when one form of fossil fuel or other fuel like went out of style, so to speak, or became uneconomical.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway表示，作为一名燃木炉的拥有者，她也对能源转型很感兴趣。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Well, I have to say as the uh proud owner of a wood burning stove now and formerly a coal burning stove, you're interested in energy transition, too.</p>
</details>

他们很高兴邀请到Nicholas Muller教授作为本期节目的嘉宾，他是卡内基梅隆大学（Carnegie Mellon）经济学、工程学和公共政策的莱斯特与朱迪思·利夫教授。Muller教授撰写了一篇名为《**美国经济中的柴火：1700年至2010年**》（Firewood in the American Economy: 1700 to 2010）的论文，专门收集柴火价格的历史数据，并探讨其如何融入更广泛的经济体系以及产出和生产力等衡量指标。

<details>

<p class="english-text">Absolutely. So I am very pleased to say that we have the perfect guest. We are going to be speaking with the author of a paper that's called firewood in the American economy 1700 to 2010 and it is all about collecting historical data on firewood prices and then figuring out how that fits into the wider economy and measures of other things like output and productivity and things like that. So we have Nicholas Mueller. is the Lester and Judith Leave Professor of Economics, Engineering, and Public Policy over at Carnegie Melon. So, Nick, welcome to the show.</p>
</details>

### 为什么研究柴火？

Muller教授解释了他选择这个主题的两个主要原因。首先，正如主持人所说，在南北战争之前，甚至在美国独立战争或建国之前，美国经济中的所有能源，无论是家庭还是从事原始生产的企业，几乎都来自柴火。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you so much. It's a pleasure to be here. Why don't I start out with why firewood? Um, and I know I mentioned that firewood was the majority of US energy consumption for many, many years. Is it right to think of it sort of as like oil the 1800's equivalent of oil powering the entire economy? Yeah. So there are two reasons why I focused on this particular topic in a paper. one, as you said, somewhere around or before the Civil War back before the American Revolution or the founding of the country, essentially all the energy in the US economy, whether it was in households or firms doing primitive things, it was all coming from firewood.</p>
</details>

学术文献和政府统计数据中缺少一份相当全面的柴火价格时间序列，这在他看来是一个巨大的空白，因此填补这一知识空白是他的一个研究动机。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so the fact that the academic literature and government statistics didn't really have a reasonably comprehensive time series of these prices seemed like a really big gap to me. And so that was one reason to just set out filling that knowledge gap.</p>
</details>

其次，在卡内基梅隆大学之前，他曾在佛蒙特州的米德尔伯里学院（Middlebury College）任教，他和家人当时用燃木炉取暖。他参与了这些非正式的柴火市场，这让他开始思考很久以前的情况会是怎样。事实证明，收集这些价格数据是一个非常有趣的过程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The other was prior to being at Carnegie Melon, I taught at Mbury College in Vermont. And my wife and kids and I used to get heat from firewood in a wood stove. And so you participate in these informal markets for firewood even today. And it got me thinking about what that must have been like long ago. And sure enough, it turned out to be a pretty interesting process to gather these prices.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal指出，虽然柴火长期以来是美国经济的主要能源，但仅仅知道这个事实还不够，拥有具体的数字究竟能带来什么益处？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I never thought of going to Lowe's to buy a bundle of firewood as participating in an informal market. I guess it is formalized nowadays, but certainly if you're a professor, that's probably how you're thinking about it. I used to live in Vermont and I I remember, you know, it was not that uncommon for people to buy a cord of firewood or however much they anticipated needing for the winter to heat their homes, etc. So, I get the idea that like, okay, fire was this dominant source of energy for a long time in the American economy? What are we gained by actually having the numbers? Like, okay, we know it. We know the fact about firewood's existence and prominence. What does it help us now and we'll get into the details but what does it help us now to actually have some sense of the size and scale?</p>
</details>

### 柴火价格数据的重要性

Muller教授认为主要有三个原因。首先，在本文之前，对早期美国经济和**GDP**（Gross Domestic Product: 国内生产总值，衡量一个国家经济活动的总体指标）的现有估算中，关于柴火价格的信息非常稀少，而且这些价格远低于他收集到的数据。这意味着即使木材消耗量估算相同，现有的GDP估算也因此被低估了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. So I think two primary reasons. One when we look at existing prior to this paper existing estimates of the early American economy and gross domestic product. It had very very sparse information on firewood prices and they turn out to be really low compared to the the prices I gathered. And so what that means is even with the same estimates of how much wood was consumed, those existing estimates of GDP that included that measure were really low in that regard. So the energy cost of economic growth using existing estimates looked much much lower than what these updated numbers suggest.</p>
</details>

因此，使用更新后的数据系列，经济增长的能源成本看起来比现有估算高得多。其次，随着时间的推移，尤其是在19世纪早期到中期，经济的规模和增长情况也显得不同。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So size of the economy two growth in the economy over time especially during the early to mid 1800s appears to be different when you use the updated series.</p>
</details>

第三，考虑到大部分柴火是在农业部门生产的，通常以非正式的家庭生产方式进行。即使是运入新兴城市的木材，也主要来自农业。这意味着，当我们审视现有的农业生产力衡量标准时，它们虽然包含了牲畜和农作物等预期项目，却遗漏了这种重要的能源商品，而这种商品实际上应该归因于农业部门。因此，这一时期的农业生产力也可能被错误衡量了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then three when you consider that the bulk of firewood was produced in the agricultural sector often in an informal way meaning just home production. But even when you think about the wood that was hauled into some of our newly forming cities, that was really all coming from agriculture. And that means that when we think about existing measures of agricultural productivity that included the sort of things you would expect, livestock and crops and the like, it was really missing this important energy commodity which was actually being attributed or should be attributed to that sector. And so agricultural productivity during this period would have been mismeasured as well.</p>
</details>

### 数据收集的挑战与方法

Joe Weisenthal指出，柴火市场过去和现在仍然是非正式的，这使得数据收集变得困难。19世纪的人们可以自行砍伐柴火，甚至无需支付任何费用。他好奇为什么这些数据以前不存在，以及Muller教授是如何收集的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So you mentioned the data gap and how significant this would be for you know measuring something like the growth of the US economy in those years. I have to imagine one of the difficulties in gathering the data for something like this is because firewood is or was still is an informal market as you pointed out. And I know I joked earlier that firewood was like the oil equivalent of the 19th century, but of course the big difference is not everyone has an oil gusher in their backyard or refinery. people in the 1800s could just go out into their land and chop down firewood. So in some respect they weren't even paying any prices for it. So I guess my question is why didn't the data exist before? And then how did you actually go about gathering it?</p>
</details>

Muller教授解释说，柴火价格和交易记录开始系统性出现，关键在于**城市化**（Urbanization: 人口从农村地区向城市地区迁移的过程）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Sure. So the critical process that enabled the prices and the price data and the the records of advertisements and exchange to start showing up in a systematic way was urbanization.</p>
</details>

在美国经济史上，从美国独立战争到南北战争期间，人口开始城市化。一旦人们迁入城市，就不再拥有后院的林地。城市化催生了通过商业交换进行的柴火市场。农业部门仍然生产柴火，但现在柴火通过各种方式运入城市并进行销售，形成了某种形式的市场交易，而不仅仅是花费时间和劳力获取木材。这导致了当时报纸广告中出现了大量关于木材的数据，按绳（cord）、树种、月份和年份分类，他们能够使用软件从PDF图像中提取这些数据。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">What ended up happening which you know this is well known in in US economic history somewhere between the American Revolution and the Civil War the population started to urbanize. We were still pretty agrarian around the time of the Civil War, but people were moving to cities. And once you move to cities, you lose that idea, Tracy, that you you just mentioned, which is we all have a wood lot in our backyard. You don't if you live in a city. And so the process of urbanization gave birth to markets for firewood that actually passed through commercial exchange. the agricultural sector was still producing the firewood, but now it was being hauled into cities by various means and sold in I don't want to say organized markets in in the sense that your breeders might think, but in the sense that there was some exchange, not just the use of time and labor to procure the wood. And so that led to records of really advertisements in that period where we started to see an abundance of data on wood by cord, by species, by month, by year that we could use software to extract from PDF images.</p>
</details>

对于1700年以前的早期数据，Muller教授解释说，它们主要来自**遗嘱认证记录**（Probate records: 记录死者遗产分配和估值的法律文件）。当户主去世时，法律实体会进入家庭并评估资产，其中通常会包括几绳柴火，并对其进行估值，因为法律要求记录遗产的价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Hm. So what is the let's talk about the data itself because we've been talking about the why of the data and the how of the data but what are the uh the top lines in terms of what your research showed. Yeah. So on the data gathering process it's important to note that I'm sure as I'm talking about urbanization urbanization happening in the 1800s. You know the price series go back to 1700. I actually have in an appendex prices from the 1600s. That begs the question where those came from and they come from largely probate and estate records where when the head of household is deceased, what would happen is legal entities would come into the household and they would value assets. And much like they do today, there'd be a settlement of an estate that includes a house and barn and animals and all the things in the household. And often one of the things in the records was five cords of firewood or you know 10 cords of firewood or one cord and they would value it because they had to legally in terms of documenting the value of the estate. So the really early stuff came from there.</p>
</details>

### 柴火价格的主要模式

Muller教授的研究揭示了柴火价格的三个主要模式：

1.  **1700年至1800年**：价格序列存在大量波动和噪音，但经通货膨胀调整后，没有显著的趋势。这意味着柴火价格的变化率与**消费者物价指数**（Consumer Price Index, CPI: 衡量商品和服务价格变化的指标）的变化率大致相同。
2.  **1800年至南北战争**：柴火价格开始实际上涨，涨幅通常在每年0.5%到1%之间，高于通货膨胀率。
3.  **南北战争后至今**：直到20世纪末的1970年代能源危机，柴火价格才再次出现系统性上涨，这可能与当时油价飙升有关，导致美国部分地区重新转向柴火。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Now back to Joe's question about what do we learn about the prices themselves and and the topline numbers. There's really three patterns that come out. There's lots of nuance, but there's three patterns that come out in the data. From 1700 to around 1,800, there's lots of noise and volatility in the price series, but there's no significant trend when you correct for inflation. So that means firewood prices were basically changing at the same rate that the price indices, the equivalent of a consumer price index, were changing over that period of time. Then from 1800 to the Civil War, firewood prices started to increase in real terms, implying that they were rising more rapidly than inflation, often between half a percent and 1% real per year. And then after the Civil War up to the modern era, there really wasn't uh a lot of evidence of a systematic price change until late in the 20th century around the energy crisis that we're all familiar with in the 1970s. there was a a systematic move back to firewood in some parts of the US and that shows up as real price increases. It probably had to do with the oil price spikes at the time.</p>
</details>

Muller教授强调，1800年至南北战争之间的中期价格上涨，对于我们理解美国经济以及从生物质能向煤炭的后续转型至关重要。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">You have these three time periods where there's no real change. There's rapid price appreciation between 1800 and the Civil War and then there's not a lot of evidence of systematic price changes afterwards. And it's that middle period that I think is the most important for how we think about the US economy and how we think about the ensuing transition from biomass to coal.</p>
</details>

### 价格上涨的驱动因素：需求、稀缺与运输

Tracy Alloway好奇为什么在1800年至南北战争期间柴火价格上涨如此迅速。她猜测木材供应变化不大，可能主要是需求驱动。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I definitely want to talk about that transition, but just before we do, why did prices actually increase that quickly in that time period? Because I imagine, okay, for prices to move, you have changes in supply and demand, but the supply of wood probably isn't changing that rapidly. Is it all just a demand story?</p>
</details>

Muller教授证实，需求方确实在发挥作用：人口增长，制造业活动增加。例如，从南北战争到更早时期，钢铁制造业完全依赖木炭。但他也认为，供应稀缺是重要因素。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, clearly the the demand side is at work. Uh the population is growing. We're engaging in more manufacturing activities. Iron manufacturing from the Civil War back in time to when it started relied exclusively on charcoal. So that was, you know, cut down wood, bake the moisture and impurities out of it and then use the resulting carbon to produce the heat that was needed. So things were growing, the demand side was growing. But it's my sense, and this is really from reading about the time. I don't I don't have an econometric or an empirical way to nail down a specific cause for the price increases, but I think what was happening based on reading is that the supplies of wood were getting scarce closer to cities.</p>
</details>

城市附近的木材供应变得稀缺，导致将木材运入城市的运输距离和成本增加。与此同时，铁路网络正在发展。虽然铁路网络理论上应该降低成本，但直到南北战争之后，火车头主要燃烧的也是木材。因此，铁路对柴火价格的影响是复杂的：它可能降低了运输成本，但同时也是巨大的木材消费者。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And so what ended up happening was the transport distances and hence costs to get wood into the cities for both consumers and firms was increasing. Concurrent with that process, the railroad network was growing. And so on the one hand, you would imagine that increasing rail networks would reduce cost, right? You you just load up a train, you get the train into the cities, and that would be much more cost-effective than putting it in a cart and pulling it with a horse or putting it in a canal. But the other thing to remember is that locomotives until really after the Civil War did not run on coal. They burned wood as well. And so you have this ambiguous effect of the railroads that may have lowered costs, but then they were voracious consumers of of wood themselves. And so I think it is a scarcity story. It's not a scarcity story in the sense that the forests were gone, but rather the forests that had been feeding urban demand for wood were receding and that led to increases in transportation costs to get uh to get the fuel into cities and the demand centers.</p>
</details>

### 劳动力、技术与木材质量

Joe Weisenthal还好奇劳动力方面的影响，即大量人口从农村迁往城市是否导致砍伐木材的劳动力稀缺。Muller教授表示，劳动力供应的稀缺性，可能导致工资上涨并进一步推高价格，这在北部地区尤为明显，因为北部城市如费城、纽约和波士顿当时正迅速发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Well, I guess the other dynamic that I'm curious about in your story is sort of the labor side. So, if you have a bunch of people moving from rural areas to cities, that's fewer people who are theoretically in the business of cutting down trees. And I'm curious if in your research, you know, was there a scarcity of labor to cut down the trees? And I'm just curious, were there technological or productivity gains that you found in the business of cutting down trees period such that in the mid 1800s did that process look substantively different than maybe earlier in the 18th century? The only thing I can really say about the agricultural labor supply is regional. And there's a table in the paper that unpacks agricultural productivity growth in the northern areas and the southern areas of the country. And one thing that table shows is that I think if I have it right, the rates of consumption of firewood outpace the rate of growth of agricultural workers in the north and kept pace in the south. And so if there is an instance where scarcity and labor supply, which would have driven up wages, was working as a force to drive up prices, it would have been the north. And that probably also aligns with the urbanization dimension, right? because the cities Philadelphia uh New York and Boston were big and they were growing rapidly and so those two forces would align.</p>
</details>

关于技术进步，Muller教授指出，技术变革主要体现在木材运输方面。从最初的动物和手推车，发展到运河（如伊利运河），再到铁路。铁路的战略设计旨在连接人口中心，这在当时正迅速发展。然而，直到南北战争前，铁路在提高柴火供应的同时，也消耗了大量木材。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">on the technology piece I really can't say anything about harvest or about felling but what I can say is the technology that was used to move wood around so whether it was going into a city or whether it was going into a village and and being sold we know that that had to have matured from very simple transportation uh means of transportations like animals and carts. Mhm. To canals and to augment boats on rivers like the Eerie Canal is is an example where we know firewood was shipped to ultimately railroads as I mentioned earlier which were strategically designed to connect population centers which the data suggests were growing very rapidly at this time. So there's clear technological change. It's just the funny thing about railroads until about the Civil War is they were both enhancing supply of firewood in demand setters, but they were also consuming really crazy amounts of wood. I mean, there were multiple cord stashes along rail lines that were monitored or manned by the railroads. Hm. And they had cords of wood and the trains would pass by and stop and they'd load up the hoppers with firewood that had been felled from the surrounding surrounding areas. So this this was a really significant demand side associated with that technological change.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway还询问了木材质量和树种是否被纳入考量。Muller教授表示，虽然大部分数据没有提供木材类型或干湿程度的详细信息，但有些数据确实报告了按树种（如橡木、山核桃木、松木）划分的价格差异。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Okay. So the technological change was mostly on the transportation side, not like I don't know people adding a new type of blade to their axe or something like that. But this actually reminds me of something I wanted to ask, which is anyone who has ever lit a wood fire will know that not all wood is created equal, and I certainly have been on the uh the receiving end of uh bad wet wood popping in my face and things like that. Did you take into account quality of wood or different species? Yeah, it's really neat. So much of the data does not provide details on type of wood or whether it's seasoned or dry. However, there are some of the data provided that do report say cord of oak, cord of hickory, cord of pine. So they do report differences by species.</p>
</details>

波特兰（Portland, Oregon）的数据甚至区分了木材的干湿等级，如湿木、半干木和全干木。数据显示，木材价格与树种的能量含量呈正相关，例如山核桃木或橡木的价格高于松木。此外，夏季销售的木材价格通常有显著折扣，这可能反映了需求较低，或者存在**远期溢价效应**（Contango effect: 指期货价格高于预期未来现货价格的市场状况），即夏季储存的木材在冬季以更高的现货价格出售。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And then the data for Portland, Oregon has about two decades worth that distinguishes grades of se how the extent to which it's seasoned. So there's green chords, there's half dry cords, and then there's fully dry cords. And so what do those data tell us? When you try to assess differences, systematic differences in price, let's say to start by species, there's a figure in the paper in one of the appendices that shows there's a pretty clear positive correlation between prices and energy content of the species of wood. And so that kind of makes sense that a cord of hickory or a quart of oak would be worth more to the consumer and in equilibrium would have a a higher market price than say a cord of pine or a cord of a softer hardwood. And so that the data support that. The second point to make is even though the information on seasoning of the wood or aging of the wood is sparse, I do observe the month at which the prices are posted for a lot of the data. And uh using that information, you can see there's a pretty steep discount for wood marketed in the summer. And one interpretation of that is that there's just lower demand, and that's fine. The the other interpretation is that there is storage and seasoning going on where uh some portion of wood harvested and or purchased in the summer is then stored to be sold at higher spot price times in the winter and that would reflect systematic differences in whether the wood is seasoned or green according to the season. So there's like a contango effect in the firewood market in the firewood market or a seasonal contango so to speak.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal还询问了随着透明度提高，价格分散度是否有所缩小，例如报纸广告出现后，价格范围是否比私人档案数据更窄。Muller教授表示，这是未来研究的一个重要方向。但他确实观察到，在1800年到南北战争期间，价格出现了区域性趋同，这可能是因为铁路作为有效的运输方式，能够消除不同地区（如中西部和东北部城市）之间持续存在的价格差异。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have another technological question. You know you mentioned at the very beginning of your time series collecting data from probate sales and so forth which I think inherently are sort of like private data that most people would not have access to unless they tried to then newspapers which is more important and I think this is an interesting story of commodities. Do you observe anything I guess what I would say of spreads or dispersion of prices as transparency became more of a thing? So such that once firewood became something that got advertised in a newspaper. Are the range of prices that were transacted in a given time period narrower than they were when this was more private archival data that you're working from? It's a fascinating question. One thing as an academic, one thing I hope is that having invested time and research assistance time in putting together this data set is that there'll be multiple papers that come from this, right? And the ability to ask and answer uh a whole series of questions. One of those is price dispersion. Yeah. Right. And so this this idea that in a given market or maybe across markets there are systematic differences in the range or spread of prices for similar commodities. So largely that's a topic for future research. But what I will say is when you look at the period from say 1800 just roughly 1800 to the civil war I do see regional convergence in prices. So southeast, northeast, midwest. I see some evidence of regional convergence and the working hypothesis there is that the railroads were such an effective means to move the wood that if there were persistent price differences between say the Midwest which included Ohio and and Pittsburgh and and Michigan and the northeastern cities then the entrepreneur could put a bunch of wood on a train in Ohio and ship it over to New York, Philadelphia and Boston and earn money and then therefore or eventually close those spreads. And as I said, I do see some evidence of that occurring as the railroad networks would have been growing up to the Civil War. After the Civil War, people were basically turning to coal and so, you know, you wouldn't see much.</p>
</details>

### 向煤炭的转型

Tracy Alloway提出，19世纪中期煤炭的出现使其成为柴火的强大竞争者，她想知道具体原因。Muller教授解释说，他收集了现有的煤炭价格估算数据，发现商业煤炭生产在南北战争前后，大约1830-1840年开始兴起。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Tracy, this is just like our first Stinson Dean conversation all over again. It's just the same like the idea of like, you know, the degree to which you're outside of the trucking lane or outside of the rail lane and these price convergence, nothing ever changes. No. Uh, apparently not. Well, actually, we just said that, but something did change in the mid 1800s, which is, I guess, the arrival of cheaper coal. What exactly was it about coal or the development of coal that suddenly made it a big competitor to firewood? So, the data show, well, let me say to be clear, what I did for coal was to assemble existing price estimates. So to be very clear with your listeners, I didn't go and gather a bunch of original information on on coal prices. There were and are very good data sources stretching back into the 19th century on anththerite by tuminous coal. And I use those and anecdotal information, qualitative information learned from reading that basically commercial coal production really got going around and just before the Civil War, maybe 1830, 1840 at the earliest.</p>
</details>

煤炭生产过程随着时间的推移呈现出单位成本下降的模式。与此形成对比的是，19世纪中期柴火价格却在上涨。因此，一种能源变得更便宜，而另一种变得更昂贵。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">And I can't speak technologically to the process of extracting and shipping coal. It's just not I don't there people that know a lot more about that than I do. But as with many production processes, it exhibited a pattern of declining cost, unit costs over time as production ramped up. And you see that in the existing coal data. It's just an empirical regularity. Now bear that in mind as I repeat in the mid 1800s as the economy is growing from 1800 towards the civil war I had just mentioned that firewood prices were increasing right so you have these contrasting patterns for two energy fuels that tell us one was getting cheaper while the other one was getting more expensive so if I stopped there and said you know that's the story that that might make sense.</p>
</details>

此外，柴火非常笨重，而相同能量的煤炭体积要小得多。从消费者或企业的角度来看，煤炭不仅更便宜，而且更容易储存和管理库存。因此，价格和燃料的非定量属性（如体积密度）共同促成了能源转型。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But the other thing to mention about firewood is It's really bulky, right? I mean, a cord is 4x4 by 8 and it it's got a good amount of energy stored in a dry cord or embodied in a dry cord, but the same amount of energy comes from a lot smaller volume of coal. And so from a consumer point of view or from a business point of view, if you've got to pay for storage or you have to manage an inventory, not only is coal getting cheaper, but it's also easier to work with in that sense. And I think that it was those two dimensions, so both literally the price and the non-quantitative attributes of the fuels that would have contributed to the transition.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal补充说，这意味着相同体积的煤炭比柴火含有更多的**BTUs**（British Thermal Units: 英国热量单位，衡量能量的单位），特别是无烟煤，这在当时正迅速普及。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">The idea there's just more on any given car load of coal, there's just way more BTUs than there would be on that same carload of firewood. Yeah. If if you had a volume measure. Yeah. Right. So 4x4 by8 dry firewood, 4x4 by8 of coal. You're going to get more BTUs out of coal, especially anththerite. And anththerite was the one that was really taking off at this time.</p>
</details>

### 柴火的持续存在与现代关联

Muller教授的研究表明，煤炭并没有完全取代柴火。尽管工业上和价格上煤炭在很大程度上取代了柴火，但柴火产业在某种意义上持续了一个多世纪。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think what's interesting to me, you know, going back to one of your first answers about your study is, and this gets back to a theme that we've talked about a lot on the show, like coal didn't kill firewood. I mean, your story, as you describe it, ends in the late 20th century. So even though we may talk about the coal era having in large part replaced firewood from an industrial standpoint from a price standpoint, you know, the firewood industry persisted in a meaningful sense, it sounds like for at least another century.</p>
</details>

美国人口普查局（US Census）的一个数据库显示，即使在1940年，俄勒冈州、华盛顿州和新英格兰的一些州，木材在家庭取暖燃料支出中仍占有相当大的份额。这表明，虽然美国在南北战争前后从生物质能经济转型为化石燃料经济，但对柴火的需求并未完全消失。在1970年代的能源价格冲击中，人们明显重新依赖柴火，以对冲家庭能源成本。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, there's a really nice database that the census put together that by state shows the share of home heating fuel expenditures by major fuel. It goes back to 1940. And if you look at 1940, states like Oregon or the state of Washington or some of the states in New England have appreciable shares of home heating that's coming from wood. So 1940 is a long time ago. I I get that. But at the same time, it's not 1840, right? It's not the Civil War. And those data are evidence in a sense that yes, I would agree with the fact that we really transitioned from a biomass to a fossil economy around the Civil War, but I would also agree that it's not as if demand for firewood was completely extinguished at that time. Clearly, there were pockets of continued significant reliance on the fuel. And then we had a massive energy price shock in the 1970s. And what that clearly showed was a reversion to reliance on the fuel as a means to hedge against home energy costs.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal提到，2008年金融危机期间，柴火需求和价格也曾上涨，这不仅说明了危机有多严重，也表明柴火具有**林迪效应**（Lindy effect: 指非易逝性事物的预期寿命与其当前寿命成正比的理论）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think you mentioned the 2008 financial crisis as well saw demand for firewood go up and maybe prices from what I remember. But that's such a fascinating data point because a it illustrates just how bad the crisis actually was that people had to turn to firewood because they couldn't afford to heat their houses in other ways. But then it also goes to the point that firewood is lindy I guess.</p>
</details>

Muller教授认为，社会和地缘政治动荡与消费者习惯（如燃料选择和碳排放）之间的联系是一个非常有趣的现象。金融危机和能源危机都是例子。他还有一篇相关论文表明，美国的**碳强度**（Carbon intensity: 单位GDP产生的碳排放量）在1917年达到峰值，那是在第一次世界大战结束和西班牙流感爆发之前，这两者都是需求和供应冲击。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah, it's a very interesting phenomenon to consider the link between social and let's say geopolitical disruptions and consumer habits that influence things like fuel choice or carbon emissions. The financial crisis is one. The energy crisis is another. I have a related working paper that demonstrates that US carbon intensity defined as tons per dollar GDP peaked in 1917 and that's the year right before World War I ended and the Spanish flu outbreak happened which were two both demand and supply shocks working in the same direction.</p>
</details>

南北战争是家庭收入与柴火需求关系的一个转折点。论文中的数据显示，**收入弹性**（Income elasticity: 衡量消费者对商品或服务的需求量随收入变化而变化的程度）从正值变为负值：随着财富增加，人们过去使用更多的柴火，但后来随着向煤炭转型，财富增加反而导致柴火使用量减少。所有这些都与重大的地缘政治或社会时期（如经济衰退和战争）相吻合。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">If you go back even further, the Civil War is really the the flipping point here for the relationship between household income and demand for firewood. Um, and that's shown in one of the figures in the paper where the income elasticity, the percentage change in income is associated with the percentage change in consumption of firewood flipped from a positive number. As we got more wealthy, we used more firewood to a negative number. As we got more wealthy, we actually used less firewood as we transitioned to coal. And those all are lining up on significant geopolitical or social periods like recessions and wars and things of that nature.</p>
</details>

### 对当前能源辩论的启示

Muller教授认为，他的研究结论与当前全球能源和环境问题有三点联系：

1.  **能源转型与社会动荡**：能源转型往往与看似外生的社会剧变相关联。例如，2007-2008年美国碳排放量达到峰值，这恰好发生在美国经济在随后几年表现不佳的时期。1860年南北战争期间也出现了类似的模式，消费者和企业转向不同的主要燃料。
2.  **资源稀缺性**：本文讨论的是可再生资源（木材），而本世纪我们关注的是不可再生资源（煤、石油、天然气）的持续依赖，以及这对增长可持续性的影响。
3.  **自然资本的价值**：拜登政府已采取重要措施，利用国民收入和产品账户（如GDP）等工具来衡量生态系统服务、污染损害和自然资源的价值。本文表明，在城市化进程和柴火进入市场之前，能源来自自然界，但并未在市场经济中得到适当核算。因此，**自然资本**（Natural capital: 经济学中指自然资源和生态系统服务）是经济增长和发展的重要贡献者，尤其是在国家发展的早期阶段。

<p class="english-text">Is there a Moby Dick for Firewood? Is there a novel, you know, like I I've read about the whailing industry and then I you know, read a novel about it. Is there a story that I could read that will sort of give me a feel for the uh you know, the early 1800s firewood industry? Is there a book that Joe is gonna read and then talk incessantly about for the next three months? So, have you read COD? I've heard of it. Yes. Wait, that's a that's a non-fiction though, right? It's non-fiction. And then the same author wrote a book called Salt. Okay. Yeah. All about COD. All about salt. There should be a book entitled Firewood or Wood or something. The closest thing I I can suggest is a is a paper by I believe it's Arthur Cole in 1970. And the title is is something like the mystery of fuelwood pricing in the United States. And it is largely qualitative and it's actually asking one of the questions that this paper tries to answer which is we were utterly reliant on this energy source and yet there is no systematic evidence of how prices behaved from the revolution to in his case 1970 and why is that? And so it's a great read. It's not you know too dense an academic. It's it's more written like something that would be uh a pleasure to read than just purely an academic piece. I'll have to uh check it out. So, I'm curious, you know, obviously the quote energy transition unquote is something that we think about now and talk about a lot now. Um you know, and the trajectory of oil demand, the trajectory of natural gas demand and so forth. all of which are highly uncertain. Other than filling in the historical record for this important thing and sort of reorienting our understanding about agricultural productivity and GDP etc. would you say there are any takeaways from your research that sort of speak more directly or speak directly to some of the energy debates that we're having right now? Yeah. So I think there are three ways in which there's a plausible connection between the conclusions in this paper and I don't want to say just the US but globally some of the issues related to energy in the environment. The first I I kind of mentioned already which is often energy transitions are associated with some seemingly exogenous source of social upheaval. So in 2008 2007 US carbon emissions in levels peaked. Now, it's just really interesting that that again happened in a year after which the US economy really did not do well for for a number of years. And I'm just talking about carbon emissions. I'm not talking about GDP or anything of the sort. When we go back to 1860, we see this same pattern happening with what primary fuel consumers and firms are turning to in order to produce and use energy. So financial crisis, recession, massive dislocation in the economy associated with the civil war and its its associated effects. So there's that energy transition happening in periods of upheaval. Two is just the notion of resource scarcity. We're talking in this paper about renewable resources. We're talking in this century at this time about non-renewable resources and the continued reliance on coal, oil, and gas. What that means for sustainability and how we think about growth and the sustainability of growth and development as we consider reliance on different energy sources. And then the third, the Biden administration had taken the very important step of using tools that we have for almost a century used to measure output. So the national income and product accounts, GDP, it had used those tools to then measure and estimate the value of things like ecosystem services and pollution damages and natural resources. And what this paper shows is that prior to the process of urbanization and firewood sort of entering markets, as we discussed a moment ago, energy was coming from the natural world and it was not being properly accounted for in our market economy nor in our expost efforts as economists to try to measure the market economy. And so it's this idea that natural capital, as economists call things like trees and fish and and ecosystems, natural capital is an important contributor to economic growth and development, often depending on where countries are in their growth stage. But in this case, we're talking about a very large contribution to what was at the time early 1800s to middle 1800s a rapidly growing economy. So three things the transition resource scarcity and how we value natural capital.</p>
</details>

### 衡量非正式经济与自然资本

Joe Weisenthal提出，研究柴火价格也涉及非正式经济的衡量问题。他好奇如何评估人们无偿劳动（如家庭成员的照护工作）的价值，这些活动虽然产生了经济成果，但未被官方GDP统计数据涵盖。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I guess there's also the aspect of the informal economy as well, right? And this is a debate that still comes up today, which is how do you value the work that people are doing just without being paid, right? So, if you're a caregiver for a family member or something like that, that's something that clearly is producing an economic outcome, but is not necessarily covered in the official GDP statistics and things like that. what lessons can we learn I guess when it comes to the informal economy and how we actually measure that.</p>
</details>

Muller教授提到，他的博士导师、2018年诺贝尔经济学奖得主Bill Nordhouse和另一位诺贝尔奖得主James Tobin在50多年前就撰写了关于这个主题的论文，探讨如何改进GDP等衡量指标，以纳入**自然资本**以及**家庭生产**（Home production: 指家庭成员为自身消费而非市场交换进行的生产活动）和休闲时间的价值。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">So, a couple things. 50 plus years ago, one of my adviserss when I was getting my PhD, a guy named Bill Nordhouse, who uh won the Nobel Prize in shared the Nobel Prize for economics in 2018, wrote a paper with James Tobin, also a Nobel Prize winner on this exact topic, right? So how do we we improve measures like GDP to take into account natural capital which I just mentioned but also home production and the value of leisure time and so home production is central to the valuation conundrum that is associated with firewood produced on the home uh in the home often used in the home at times marketed through the formal economy and then increasingly done so. So it raises those issues in a very central way.</p>
</details>

他指出，如果将柴火生产和消费的价值与现有GDP衡量标准进行比较，那么也应该衡量所有在家中发生的有价值的活动，如清洁、烹饪、缝补衣物、建造房屋和谷仓等。衡量柴火的努力，正是为了推动我们从严格的市场意义上的GDP衡量，走向包含这些其他重要的社会福利决定因素的更全面衡量。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I will say that some of the online discussions of this paper that I've been made aware of raise a very important point which is you know if you're going to compare the value of firewood production and consumption to existing measures of GDP which is largely the within market version of economic output. Then you should also measure all the valuable things that happen in the home, cleaning, cooking, mending clothes, uh constructing homes and barns and all the things that happened back in this historical period. And that's absolutely true. The the right measure would include all those things. I would just consider that the effort to measure firewood is an effort to push the boulder up the hill, right? to get us from measuring GDP in the strictly market sense towards that measure that includes these other important determinants of social welfare.</p>
</details>

### 数字化在历史研究中的作用

Tracy Alloway好奇，这种类型的数据收集和研究在10年前是否可能实现。Muller教授认为，部分工作可能可行，但会更加费力，因为数据源可能还在**缩微胶卷**（Microfilm: 一种用于存储大量文档图像的胶卷格式）上。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I have just one more question and it sort of follows very nicely from the point you just made but do you think this type of research this type of data gathering would have been possible say 10 years ago? I know you mentioned that you use software to word scrape a bunch of documents, old documents that would have been uploaded into you know a library system or a central database or something like that. Could you have done this just 10 years ago? So aspects of it probably, but it would have been much more laborious because the data sources probably would have been on microfilm or something like that. And so the hours required to gather a certain number of price quotes would have been considerably higher.</p>
</details>

然而，在15或20年前，他认为几乎不可能。现在有许多完全在线的档案，通过大学订阅服务提供，它们是旧文本的图像。例如，构成早期价格序列的遗嘱认证记录都是从这些在线资源中找到的，而不是亲自去档案馆。这些信息储备在社区努力数字化并公开这些信息之前，是不可能收集到的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">But 20 years, 15 or 20 years, I don't really think so. I mean, there's a bunch of I don't even know quite how to properly refer to them. So archives maybe is the best way to put it that are fully online. They are made available through university subscription services and they're literally images of very old texts. The probate records for instance that comprise the very early price series were all in those sources. I didn't go to you know uh records in Salem, Massachusetts. I found it all online. And that is a reserve of information or data that would not have been possible to collect prior to community's efforts to digitize and make public that information. So I guess my answer uh the short version to my answer is would it have been possible 10 years ago some small version of it? Yes, at much higher time expense but 15 or 20 years ago I I don't think so.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway对此表示非常感兴趣，她认为随着数字化和人工智能的发展，未来将发现更多新的数据源，这将对我们理解经济产生巨大影响。

<p class="english-text">I find this so interesting because now I'm thinking about all the um new data sources that we're going to find thanks to digitization and AI and all of that stuff and the impact on how we understand the economy. But we're going to have to leave it there. Nicholas Muller, thank you so much for coming on OPATs. Really enjoyed speaking with you and really enjoyed the paper.</p>

### 结语

Joe Weisenthal总结说，铁路作为价格趋同的来源，这一模式在商品历史上反复出现，如今在天然气管道等领域也能看到类似现象。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Thank you. Yeah, that was great. Thank you so much for having me. It's been a pleasure. Joe, I love that conversation. I love doing these sort of single topic episodes cuz it just opens up all these avenues that you haven't necessarily thought that much about before. Totally. Well, there's a lot in there. You know, one place to start. I mean, there's there is a lot. uh the idea of like railroads as this source of like price convergence. It's very intuitive obviously, right? But it's still interesting to see like how often this pattern gets repeated over and over again through commodity history. Obviously these days, you know, the story is much more with natural gas pipelines and the attempts to arbitrage spreads between, you know, there's not one unified natural gas price the way there is in oil precisely because of these transportation networks. Maybe there will be at some point with enough pipelines. That's one story that you see repeated over and over again throughout commodities.</p>
</details>

Tracy Alloway补充说，能源转型通常比人们想象的要漫长，历史上有许多例子表明，一种新商品出现后，人们并不会迅速完全转向。柴火的例子再次证明了这一点，即使在1970年代和2008年金融危机期间，甚至在2022年俄罗斯入侵乌克兰后，欧洲部分地区也曾重新使用木材取暖。除了鲸油，其他商品都很难被完全取代。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">Yeah. I also just think the point about the energy transition which we've discussed with Bob Bracket before as you mentioned this idea that we have a notion in our minds often that like suddenly a new commodity comes on the scene and everyone switches over really quickly. But actually we have lots and lots of historical examples of the process taking a lot longer than you would think. And I think Bob used the example of mercury and now we have another example in the form of firewood. I certainly was not expecting to hear that part about yet another firewood price spike of the 1970s. Like I I sort of Yeah. Like in my mind it's like okay the story probably ends somewhere around the late 1800s. And so the fact that a hundred years later and then you know another 30 or 40 years later it's visible again. I also think maybe like weren't there some stories about using fireword like in 2022 um after Russia's invasion of Ukraine? I can't remember for sure, but I feel like I remember hearing some stories about parts of Europe, you know, um burning fire, burning wood again for heat. So, yeah, it's uh it's really hard to actually fully ever displace a commodity except whale oil.</p>
</details>

Joe Weisenthal表示，就BTUs而言，他个人更喜欢木材，因为它是一种真正可再生的资源，而且不会像煤炭那样让整个房子蒙上一层黑灰。

<details>

<p class="english-text">I have to say my personal preference when it comes to BTUs now that I've done coal and wood has to be wood.
