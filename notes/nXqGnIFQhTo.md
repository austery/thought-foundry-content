### 资本集团的独特地位

**Nicolai Tangen**: 大家好。我是**挪威主权财富基金**的 CEO Nicolai Tangen。今天我邀请到了**资本集团（Capital Group）**的总裁兼 CEO **Mike Gitlin**。资本集团是全球最大的投资管理公司之一，管理资产超过 **3 万亿美元**。更重要的是，资本集团拥有一种独特的投资方式，由员工持股。Mike，我认为你们是投资界的金科玉律，很高兴你能来到这里。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Hi everybody. I'm Nicolai Tangen, the CEO of the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund and today I'm joined by Mike Gitlin, president and CEO of Capital Group, which is one of the world's largest investment managers with more than three trillion in assets. Now, more importantly, Capital Group has a unique approach to investing owned by its employees and I kind of think that you are the gold standard in investing, Mike. So, great to have you here.

</details>

**Mike Gitlin**: 谢谢，我们可以就此结束访谈了（笑）。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Gitlin**: Well, thank you. We can end it there.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 那可不行。资本集团已经存在了近 100 年。对于那些还不了解你们的听众，你们具体是做什么的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: No way. No way. Now, Capital Group, you've been around for nearly 100 years. But for those of the listeners who don't know, what do you do?

</details>

**Mike Gitlin**: 我们为全球客户管理资金。这些客户可能由财务顾问提供服务，也可能是大型机构，如**主权财富基金**、定额给付计划或定额供款计划。所以，我们既有财富管理业务，也有机构业务。但归根结底，这一切都是在为最终的个人管理资金。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Gitlin**: So, we manage money for people around the world and those people may be served by a financial advisor and they may be a part of a large-scale institution like a sovereign wealth fund, a defined benefit plan, a defined contribution plan. So, it's both a wealth management business and an institutional business, but at the end of the day, all of that is managing money for people at the end of the day.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 你们为很多人管理退休基金。你们到底在帮助多少人？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: And you've got a lot of you run the retirement funds for a lot of people. How many people are you helping?

</details>

**Mike Gitlin**: 仅在美国，就有超过 **2000 万个家庭**持有资本集团的产品，无论是共同基金、**ETF** 还是集体投资信托。在全球范围内，还有数以百万计的客户。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Gitlin**: There's over 20 million families in the US, for example, that own something that Capital Group does, whether it's a mutual fund, an ETF, a collective investment trust, whatever way they consume that service. and globally millions of people as well.

</details>

### 核心竞争力：资本系统 (The Capital System)

**Nicolai Tangen**: 是什么让你们如此独特？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: What is it that make you guys unique?

</details>

**Mike Gitlin**: 我认为有两点。第一是我们如何管理业务，第二是我们如何管理资金。在业务管理方面，我们不需要考虑公开市场的季度收益。我们的内部股东明白，我们是为了长期而投资。即使 **S&P 500** 指数下跌 20%，我们仍能继续投资那些在其他公司可能会被叫停的技术项目。

我们能够跨周期投资自己的业务，这让我们的客户受益，因为我们很稳定，不会对市场状况反应过度。至于管理资金的方式，我们在 1958 年推出了名为“**资本系统（The Capital System）**”的模式。这是一种与世界上其他任何人都不同的资金管理方式。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Gitlin**: I'd say it's two things. One is how we manage our business and the other one is how we manage our money. So in terms of managing our business, we don't have to think about quarterly earnings in the public space. And we have shareholders internally who understand that we're investing in the business for the long term. So the S&P 500 can be down 20%. And we can still invest in that technology project that at another company might just get stopped. So we're able to invest through the cycle in our own business which helps our clients because we're stable. We're not super reactive to the market conditions in that regard. And then how we manage our money. In 1958, we launched something called the capital system. It's just a different way to manage money than everybody else in the world.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 这就是你们的“秘密配方”，对吧？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: That's like your secret source, right?

</details>

**Mike Gitlin**: 没错。这是一个天才的概念，诞生于挑战时刻。当时我们的创始人突发心脏病，幸存后回到办公室说，我们不能在存在“**关键人物风险（Key Person Risk）**”的情况下管理资金。这对客户不利。

于是，资本系统应运而生。在这个系统中，**分析师本身就是投资者**。他们不是信用评级员或股票推荐员，而是直接投资真实的客户资产。此外，一个投资组合由多位基金经理协作管理，而不是由一个人掌控所有资金。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Gitlin**: It is. And I can speak about it. It was a brilliant concept, but it came out of a moment of challenge. At that time, our founder had had a heart attack, survived. when he came back to the office said we can't manage money with key person risk. It's just not good for the clients. And so the capital system was formed where the analysts themselves are investors. They're not credit raiders or stock raiders. They invest real client assets. And then you'd have multiple portfolio managers collaborate in a portfolio as opposed to just one person managing all the money.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 为什么这样做更好？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Why is why is that good?

</details>

**Mike Gitlin**: 有几个原因。首先，管理资金的分析师有“**切身利益（Skin in the game）**”。那是真实的客户资产，不仅仅是一个买入或卖出的评级，而是真金白银。当你实际管理资金时，责任感是完全不同的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Gitlin**: It's good for a few reasons. One is an analyst who manages money has skin in the game. That's real client assets. It's not a buy rating or a sell rating. It's money. That's a very different responsibility when you're actually managing money.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 所以你确保了更多的人晚上睡不好觉。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: So you make sure that more people sleep badly at night.

</details>

**Mike Gitlin**: 当分析师管理资金时，他们会理解组合风险、多样化以及如何参与新股发行或 **IPO** 市场。这与单纯评级的分析师完全不同。对于基金经理来说，最大的区别在于你不会被局限在某一个人的第 300 个“好主意”里。

你可以从同一策略下的几位基金经理那里获得最强的信心。一切都是公开透明的，每个人都能看到所有内容。你可以表达自己的观点，而不会觉得整个组合的重量都压在自己一个人的肩膀上。但每项投资都有专人负责。每个投资策略都有一个**首席投资官（Principal Investment Officer）**，他们就像管弦乐队的指挥，承担最终责任。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Gitlin**: So one thing you could do when an analyst manage money is they understand portfolio risk. They understand diversification. They understand how to participate in the new issue or the IPO market. They just have a different way they go about them than an analyst who raised credits. And then for portfolio managers, I think the biggest difference is you're not left with one individual's 300th best idea. You get the strongest convictions from several portfolio managers in the same strategy. Everything's open. Everybody can see everything. But you can express conviction without feeling like the weight of the entire portfolio is on your individual shoulder. But one person is responsible for each investment. Each investment strategy has a principal investment officer. They are the conductor of the orchestra and they have accountability. But there'll be a research portfolio and there'll also be other portfolio managers alongside all in the same strategy all expressing their conviction. It's just different.

</details>

### 长期主义的制度保障

**Nicolai Tangen**: 如果一个产品表现很差，你会解雇整个团队，还是只解雇一个人？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: So if one product does badly, you do you fire the whole team or you fire one person or what what do you do?

</details>

**Mike Gitlin**: 我们不这样看问题。我们会审视谁参与了投资组合，他们的风险特征是什么。我们尝试将具有互补技能的人组合在一起。我们拥有大量数据，了解他们的**上行捕获（Upside capture）**和**下行捕获（Downside capture）**。我们知道他们如何管理资金。作为分析师，当市场大幅上涨或下跌时，你的参与度是多少？你是防御型的还是进攻型的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Gitlin**: Well, we don't really think about it that way. We we think about who's participating in the portfolio. What are their risk characteristics? We try to combine people with complimentary skills. We have so much data on them. So we know their upside capture, downside capture. We know how they manage money because as an analyst, remember is how much of an increase in a share price do you actually manage to or the overall market when the market's going up a lot or down a lot? How much do you participate? Are you more defensive? or you're more offensive.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 这种协作模式如何促进学习和知识传递？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: How does it help learning? How does it help learning and knowledge transfer? The fact that you have these people working together,

</details>

**Mike Gitlin**: 在投资单位里，大家围坐在一起，一切都是公开的。这里没有等级制度。你是基金经理，我是分析师，但这并非阶级森严。我们共享想法，所有投资组合都是透明的。这能把所有想法都摆在桌面上。因为你我都可以表达各自的信心，这避免了“**群体思维（Groupthink）**”的环境。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Gitlin**: I think what you have is you have people sitting around the table in a certain investment unit and everything's open. There's no hierarchy. You're a portfolio manager. I'm an analyst. It's not hierarchical. And so we all share ideas. All the portfolios are open so everybody can see them. And what it does is it gets the ideas all on the table. And because you and I can express our convictions, it doesn't promote an environment of groupthink.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 你们的基金经理任职时间非常长，对吧？平均任期是否超过了 20 年？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: These portfolio managers, they hang in there for ages, right? I mean, is is it right that the average tenure is more than 20 years?

</details>

**Mike Gitlin**: 是的，我们的人才流失率极低。为什么？因为文化，因为股权结构，也因为他们热爱资本集团。我们在面试时就会告诉应聘者：“如果你不打算在这里度过整个职业生涯，那就别来。”

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Gitlin**: Yeah. Our folks stay. Why? They stay because of the culture. They stay because of the nature of the shareholding. Um, and they stay because they love Capital Group. I mean, they come. We tell people when we're interviewing, if you don't think you're going to be here for your entire career, don't come. So our attrition rate for investment professionals is in low single digits. I mean they do come for their careers.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 什么样的基金经理在资本集团表现最好？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Now who does best at capital? What are kind of the quality characteristics of the best portfolio managers?

</details>

**Mike Gitlin**: 是那些随着时间推移变得越来越聪明，但不会发生“**风格漂移（Style Creep）**”的人。他们清楚自己是哪种类型的投资者。当市场极度偏向某一方时，他们不会改变风格，这样当市场回归均值时，他们不会处于不利地位。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Gitlin**: Portfolio managers who get smarter and smarter over time but don't engage in style creep. They know the kind of manager they are, the kind of investor they are. And when markets are really skewed one way or the other, they don't engage in style creep so that when the market reenters, they're not caught off sides.

</details>

### 主动管理 vs. 被动管理

**Nicolai Tangen**: 现在的**主动管理**与**被动管理**策略发生了很大变化。你如何看待这对资产管理行业的影响？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Now another thing which has changed is the whole kind of active passive strategy. So, how do you see that impacting the asset management industry?

</details>

**Mike Gitlin**: 30 多年前，被动投资还不存在。现在它占据了股票市场约一半的份额。这产生了巨大的影响。流入被动投资的资金使得基准指数变得更加集中。

人们现在反而开始寻找远离这种集中基准的**多样化**机会。这很有意思，因为被动投资最初的概念就是为了多样化。但当基准指数被少数几家公司占据时，主动管理者通过在全球范围内寻找这些指数之外的机会，就拥有了巨大的优势。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Gitlin**: Well, 30 years ago, a little more than 30 years ago, passive didn't exist. So, now it's about half the marketplace in equities. So, it's massively impactful. Um, and what it's done with flows into passive is it makes a benchmark even more concentrated. When I look at our institutional business, we're seeing our requests for proposals, our RFPs go up to the right. So why is that? One, I think it's because people recognize the benchmarks are super concentrated with half of the assets going into passive and fewer amount of assets in active management in relative terms. That skews the market and it makes this concentrated benchmark. So people are literally looking for diversification away from a concentrated benchmark. I never thought I'd say that.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 为什么战胜指数如此困难？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Tell me why is it so difficult to beat the index?

</details>

**Mike Gitlin**: 在过去十年里确实很难，因为市场变得非常畸形。特别是在美国，有一些关于基金管理的法规限制了你持有单一股票的比例。当基准指数变得极度集中时，即使你想跟进，法律也不允许。但随着市场广度的扩大，主动管理者没有理由不战胜基准。我们现在正进入这样一个时期。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Gitlin**: Well, it was difficult in the last decade because of how skewed it became and in some rules around especially in the US and 40 act rules around how funds can be managed, you had concentration limits of how much you can actually own in a single stock. So, as the benchmark got more skewed, you weren't even able to do that if you wanted to. Um, and that became an issue. As the market broadens, there's no excuses for active managers not to beat benchmarks. And I think you will see a market broadening. You're already starting to see that.

</details>

### AI 与 94 年的数据积淀

**Nicolai Tangen**: 资本集团如何使用 **AI**？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Moving on to AI. How do you use AI in capital?

</details>

**Mike Gitlin**: 这取决于具体的部门。在运营端，我们利用 AI 处理商品化的职能。在客户服务端，AI 可以读取所有笔记，为财务顾问提供“准备会议”功能，使互动更有价值。

在投资管理方面，想象一下我们拥有 **94 年的数据**。我们将整个图书馆数字化了。资本集团写的每一份关于每一只股票的报告都在其中。这是我们的**专有优势**。作为投资者，我可以问 AI：“在过去利率下降、估值较高的类似环境下，我犯过什么错误？”它会梳理我 30 年来的所有投资数据，给我提醒。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Gitlin**: Well, it depends on the group. The operating group taking commoditized functions, having them go away and having those individuals spend their time on higher value added activities. In the client group, you're going in to see a financial advisor on the wealth management side. Hit the prep me button. It tells you everything about that financial advisor that you've already put in the system. So you can make it a more productive interaction with the advisor. Translation makes it available immediately for everybody around the world in their language. On the investment management side, think about 94 years of data. We've digitized our entire library over 94 years. Every single report on every single stock ever written at Capital Group, that's a proprietary advantage. I'm an investor. I've been at Capital Group 30 years. This environment has rates that are coming down. Valuations are relatively high. What mistakes have I made in the past in the similar environments? Goes through all of my data managing money and it tells me things to be aware of.

</details>

### 为什么选择与 KKR 合作

**Nicolai Tangen**: 你们最近与 **KKR** 建立了合作伙伴关系进入私募市场。为什么选择合作而不是自己起步？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Another thing which is changing is of course the private market and you just entered a partnership with KKR. Why did you decide to do that instead of starting on your own?

</details>

**Mike Gitlin**: 我们有三个选择：收购、自建或合作。自建意味着你要拿客户的钱去“练手”，或者抽调现有团队的精力，这会分散我们对目前管理的 3.2 万亿美元资产的关注。收购则面临文化挑战。

我们选择合作，是因为我们相信合作伙伴能比我们做得更好。KKR 已经做了 50 年。让他们负责私募部分，我们负责公募部分，将其融合为一个对客户友好的解决方案。这并非为了获取全部经济利益，而是为了提供最佳解决方案。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Gitlin**: Yeah, it's a great question. I mean we had three choices. We could have bought something, we could have built it ourselves, or we could have partnered. To build it ourselves, you would then have to be willing to practice on your client's money, right? And you'd also have to be willing to either bring in a team which could be a cultural challenge or take people on your existing team and tell them to do something different which would distract them from the $3.2 trillion dollars we're already managing today. So we weren't willing to do that. The acquisition side again was a cultural challenge. So the only thing we had to believe in partnering is whoever we partnered with could do it better than us. We ended up with KKR. They've done it for 50 years. We'll let them do the private portion. We'll do the public portion. We'll blend it together in a client-friendly solution.

</details>

### 独特的合伙人所有制

**Nicolai Tangen**: 你们的股权结构也很特别，由合伙人持有。这是如何运作的？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Another way you are differentiated is the way you are owned, right? So you are owned by the partners. How does that work?

</details>

**Mike Gitlin**: 我会说这是由所有者“租赁”的。所有者持有股份直到退休，然后卖回给下一代。

94 年前，我们的创始人就预见到，到他孙辈那一代，他的家族将不再持有任何股份。所有的股份都将由当时在资本集团工作的人持有。这种心态意味着，如果你整天在挑选股债、服务客户，那么公司就是属于你的，而不是属于那些已经退休的人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Gitlin**: Well, I would say it's rented by the owners, meaning the owners own it until they retire and they sell it back to the next generation. 94 years ago the founder says in three generations from now, none of my family will own any of the stock. It will all be owned by the people who work at Capital Group at the time. So, the mentality is if you're in it, if you're picking stocks and bonds all day long and servicing our clients all day long, it's about you, not necessarily the people who are retired.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 很多合伙制公司最终都选择了上市，比如高盛。你们动过这个念头吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Now many partnerships have gone public and listed on a sock exchange, right? Goldman Sachs and so on. Why have you been close to doing that or is it something you cannot do?

</details>

**Mike Gitlin**: 我们可以做，但我们不会做。为什么要放弃自己最大的优势之一呢？我们拥有极其强大的资产负债表，没有长期债务，不需要出售业务。过去任何一代合伙人本可以为了个人经济利益将其变现，但他们没有。这是一种心态：我们要照顾好这份事业，使其比今天更好，然后传给下一代。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Gitlin**: We could do it, we wouldn't do it. Why would you take what may be one of your biggest advantages and willingly give it away? We have an incredibly strong balance sheet. We have no long-term debt. We don't need to sell the business. Any one of the past generations could have monetized for their own financial gain. It's a mentality thing. We're supposed to take care of the business, make it even better than it is today, and pass it off to the next generation to do the same.

</details>

### 招聘与企业文化

**Nicolai Tangen**: 你们的招聘过程非常漫长。到底有多长？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: It's a long interview process. How long is long?

</details>

**Mike Gitlin**: 可能需要 **6 到 12 个月**。有人问我是否因为流程太长而失去过候选人？当然有，但从长远来看，花这些时间是值得的。我们没有一票否决权，但每个人都有发言权。

如果你是一名投资专业人士加入我们，我们会要求你进行“行业审查”。这意味着在头三到六个月里，你不需要急着产出，而是去研究某个特定行业，然后告诉整个团队，作为一名投资者，你的投资组合会是什么样子。我们给人们时间去适应，而不是匆忙让他们管理资金。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Gitlin**: It can be anywhere from 6 to 12 months. Someone said have you ever lost a candidate because the process was too long? And I said, 'Yeah, of course we have, but it's worth it over the long run to take that time. The good thing is nobody has veto power on anything. But everyone has a voice. If you're an investment professional and you're joining, you conduct an industry review. Meaning, we tell you, don't be quote unquote productive day one. Take three to six months, look at a certain industry, research it, and come to the whole group and tell them what's your portfolio going to look like as an investor.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 谈谈你们的核心价值观。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: What are the other cultural things?

</details>

**Mike Gitlin**: 我们的核心价值观包括：**诚信（Integrity）**、**多元视角（Diverse perspectives）**、**长期主义（Long-term）**——我们之前提到的八年考核期、**社区（Community）**以及**以客户为中心（Client focus）**。

我们正在改进的一点是，不再将“卓越”与“缓慢”挂钩。过去，我们有时会因为过于谨慎而以缓慢为荣。现在我们意识到，我们可以保持快速的节奏，同时依然追求卓越。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Gitlin**: Integrity. Diverse perspectives. Long-term. We talked about eight-year number driving quantitative bonuses. Community. And the fifth one is client focus. The one thing that we're getting better and better at is not associating excellence with speed or the lack thereof. At times in our past, we would be so slow to do something because we were so measured that we ended up at times priding ourselves on slowness. I think now the whole organization recognizes we can move at pace and still be excellent.

</details>

### 个人习惯与职业建议

**Nicolai Tangen**: 你早上几点起床？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: When do you wake up in the morning?

</details>

**Mike Gitlin**: **四点**。我不需要花很长时间打理头发（笑），所以我很快就能准备好，五点就到办公室了。我喜欢早起处理事情，晚上我的脑子就不太灵光了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Gitlin**: Four. Well, it doesn't take me a long time to do my hair, so I quickly get ready and go into the office. I'm in the office by 5. I like doing the early stuff. I'm not too bright at nighttime.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 你读什么书？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: What do you read?

</details>

**Mike Gitlin**: 我更喜欢**虚构类小说**，因为我的生活本身就是非虚构的。我喜欢 Jeffrey Archer、Steve Barry、Daniel Silva 的书。当然，我也会读《金融时报》、《华尔街日报》和《巴伦周刊》。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Gitlin**: I'm a big fan of fiction as opposed to non-fiction. My life is a non-fiction story. So, I read a lot of fiction. Anything that Jeffrey Archer writes, Steve Barry, Daniel Silva, I love those kind of books. I read the regular publications like the FT, Wall Street Journal, Barons.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 如果你不在资产管理行业，你会做什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: If you were not in asset management, what do you think you would be doing?

</details>

**Mike Gitlin**: 可能会当一名**老师**。大学毕业后我的第一份工作就是在澳大利亚教书，我很喜欢那段时光。我可能会教英语或历史。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Gitlin**: Probably be a teacher. Right when I left university, my first job was teaching in Australia, and I loved it. I'd probably be a teacher, maybe English or history.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 你对年轻学生有什么建议？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: And what would be your advice to these young students generally when it came to their lives?

</details>

**Mike Gitlin**: 第一，不要觉得你现在就必须预知未来，没人能做到。40 年前你肯定没预见到自己会坐在这个位置上。第二，在假设自己有能力做下一件事之前，先把你手头的事情做到**卓越**。如果你表现卓越，你自然会脱颖而出。保持好奇心，不要计划得太远。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Mike Gitlin**: One, I think when you're young you think you have to know your future then, which none of us do. The second part is be excellent at what you do before you assume that you're capable to do the next thing. You'll stand out if you're excellent. Be curious and don't plan too far ahead.

</details>

**Nicolai Tangen**: 好的，Mike。你显然在自己的工作中表现卓越。当你成为老师时，只要你愿意教历史和英语，我一定会报名参加你的课程。谢谢。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Nicolai Tangen**: Well, Mike, you clearly are excellent in what you do and so when you become a teacher, I'll sign up for your class as long as you're willing to learn history and English. Thank you. I appreciate it.

</details>
