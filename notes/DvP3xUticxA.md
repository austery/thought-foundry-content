### 爱的普世性与进化根源

No matter what their gods were, what they did for a living, what they wore, the songs they sang, everything varies except love, and everybody loves.
无论他们信仰何种神祇，从事何种职业，穿着何种服饰，歌唱何种歌曲，所有这些都各不相同，唯有爱是普遍的，人人都爱。

So I became convinced that this was a real thing, that we were built somehow to form partnerships.
因此，我确信爱是真实存在的，我们人类的构造某种程度上就是为了形成伴侣关系。

And then the day came when I thought to myself, "Well, then it must be something in the brain."
然后有一天，我心想：“既然如此，那它肯定与大脑有关。”

(light thoughtful music)

[Narrator] The science of romantic love.

### 探寻伴侣关系的奥秘

I really began by wondering why we bother to pair up at all.
我最初确实是想知道，我们为什么会费心去结成伴侣。

97% of **mammals** (Mammals: 一类恒温脊椎动物，通常胎生并用乳汁哺育幼崽) do not pair up; people do.
97%的**哺乳动物**不会结成伴侣；但人类会。

So I thought that might be quite easy.
所以我以为这会很容易理解。

And I looked at the **Demographic Yearbooks of the United Nations** (Demographic Yearbooks of the United Nations: 联合国出版的年度统计报告，收录全球人口、出生、死亡、婚姻等数据), and in every culture in the world, and not only around the world today but historically, traditional societies, **hunter-gathering societies** (Hunter-gathering societies: 以狩猎和采集野生食物为生的人类社会), **agrarian peoples** (Agrarian peoples: 以农业种植为主要生产方式的人类社会) and **herding peoples** (Herding peoples: 以饲养牲畜为主要生产方式的人类社会), every single culture in the world has some mechanism for people to form some sort of partnership to rear their babies as a team.
我查阅了**联合国人口年鉴**，发现世界上每一个文化，不仅是当今世界各地，也包括历史上传统的**采集狩猎社会**、**农耕社会**和**畜牧社会**，都有某种机制让人类结成某种伴侣关系，共同抚养他们的孩子。

And so I really started by looking at the Demographic Yearbooks of the United Nations, reading over 90 **ethnographic studies** (Ethnographic studies: 对特定文化或社会群体的系统性观察和描述) of hunter-gatherers and agrarian peoples and herding peoples, et cetera.
因此，我确实是从查阅联合国人口年鉴开始的，阅读了90多项关于采集狩猎者、农耕民族和畜牧民族等的**民族志研究**。

And I just kept seeing the same pattern.
我只是不断地看到相同的模式。

And I remember I was walking along in **Greenwich Village** (Greenwich Village: 位于美国纽约市曼哈顿的一个街区，以其波希米亚文化和艺术氛围闻名); it was about three o'clock on a weekday afternoon, and I suddenly thought to myself, "These three **brain systems** (Brain systems: 大脑中相互关联的神经结构和通路，共同执行特定功能) must have evolved: **sex drive** (Sex drive: 驱动个体寻求性行为的生理和心理欲望), feelings of intense **romantic love** (Romantic love: 一种强烈的情感状态，涉及对另一个人的强烈吸引、迷恋和依恋), and feelings of **attachment** (Attachment: 一种深厚的情感联结，通常指个体对另一个人产生的持久情感纽带)."
我记得当时我正走在**格林威治村**，那是一个工作日的下午三点左右，我突然想到：“这三种**大脑系统**一定已经进化出来了：**性冲动**、强烈**浪漫爱情**的感觉和**依恋**的感觉。”

I remember even where I was standing.
我甚至还记得当时我站在哪里。

And I thought maybe if I could put people into a **brain scanner** (Brain scanner: 用于观察和记录大脑活动的医疗设备，如fMRI), I could find the basic brain pathways, the basic brain circuitry of these three basic brain systems.
我想，也许如果我能把人放进**脑部扫描仪**，我就能找到这三种基本大脑系统的基本大脑通路和基本大脑回路。

A lot of people have studied the sex drive. I didn't need to study that.
很多人都研究过性冲动。我不需要研究那个。

We know some of the genes, we know some of the hormones, we know the pathways really. I mean, to some extent certainly.
我们知道一些基因，知道一些荷尔蒙，我们也确实了解这些通路。我的意思是，在某种程度上是肯定的。

But quite a bit about the sex drive.
但关于性冲动已经了解很多了。

So I felt that it was more important for me to study romantic love and feelings of attachment.
所以我觉得对我来说，研究浪漫爱情和依恋感更为重要。

And I focused on romantic love because people really do think it's part of the supernatural.
我专注于浪漫爱情，因为人们确实认为它是超自然的一部分。

Most people don't kill themselves over an attachment. They kill themselves over romantic love.
大多数人不会因为依恋而自杀。他们会因为浪漫爱情而自杀。

I mean, it is such a powerful brain system that I thought to myself, "If I can figure out what's happening in the brain, maybe I can help people understand this and, in fact, maybe not even kill themselves when they are rejected."
我的意思是，这是一种如此强大**大脑系统**，以至于我心想：“如果我能弄清楚大脑中发生了什么，也许我能帮助人们理解这一点，甚至在被拒绝时可能不会自杀。”

Nobody gets out of love alive. We all suffer.
没有人能毫发无伤地走出爱情。我们都会经历痛苦。

Some people suffer more than others. Some people respond very dramatically, and some people can get over it relatively quickly.
有些人比其他人承受更多痛苦。有些人反应非常强烈，而有些人则能相对较快地走出来。

But nobody gets out of love alive. We all have disappointments.
但没有人能毫发无伤地走出爱情。我们都会有失望。

It's such a powerful brain system.
它是一种如此强大**大脑系统**。

### 爱的普世性与达尔文主义视角

I mean, everywhere in the world. It's very interesting because, you know, I was talking to a man, an anthropologist, who studies the people in China.
我的意思是，它遍布世界各地。这很有趣，因为我曾与一位研究中国人的**人类学家**交谈。

This was many years ago. And he said, "Oh, the Chinese don't love."
这是很多年前的事了。他说：“哦，中国人不爱。”

Well, he didn't read any of their love poetry.
嗯，他没有读过任何他们的爱情诗。

Everywhere in the world, there's poetry and songs and dances and dramas that express love.
世界各地都有表达爱情的诗歌、歌曲、舞蹈和戏剧。

So he went back to China, and he said to his assistant, who was Chinese, he said, "Well, I mean, in China they don't love."
所以他回到中国，对他的中国助手说：“嗯，我的意思是，在中国他们不爱。”

And the assistant broke down, started crying, and said, "I have a woman who doesn't love me. I don't know what I'm gonna do."
然后助手崩溃了，开始哭泣，说：“我有一个不爱我的女人。我不知道该怎么办。”

And that sent him on to studying romantic love in China.
这促使他开始研究中国的浪漫爱情。

And when you look around the world, I mean, the poetry.
当你环顾世界，我的意思是，那些诗歌。

You know, a lot of anthropologists study potsherds or post holes or arrowheads or all kinds of more sophisticated things.
你知道，很多**人类学家**研究陶器碎片、柱洞、箭头或其他各种更复杂的东西。

But I really like to read poetry because I think it's a basic artifact of this basic brain system.
但我真的很喜欢读诗歌，因为我认为它是这个基本**大脑系统**的基本**人工制品**。

And it always says the same thing. I remember one poem by a Chinese person, and it was something like this.
它总是表达着同样的东西。我记得一首中国人的诗，它是这样写的。

It was something like, you know, "I cannot bear to put away the bamboo sleeping mat. The night I brought you home, I watched you roll it out."
它大概是这样，你知道，“我实在不忍心收起那张竹席。把你带回家的那个夜晚，我看着你把它铺开。”

Even the things that a lover touches in your house acquire meaning.
即使是爱人触碰过的家里的物品，也获得了意义。

The brain acquires meaning to anything that has to do with romance and attachment.
大脑赋予任何与浪漫和依恋相关的事物以意义。

It's so profoundly basic to who we are.
它对我们之所以为我们，是如此深刻地基础。

Because if you don't love and you don't attach, you don't have babies, and you don't send your DNA into tomorrow.
因为如果你不爱，不依恋，你就不会有孩子，你的DNA就不会传承到明天。

And from a **Darwinian perspective** (Darwinian perspective: 一种基于查尔斯·达尔文自然选择理论的观点，强调生物特征对生存和繁殖的适应性), you lose.
从**达尔文主义视角**来看，你就输了。

### 动物的吸引力与人类伴侣关系的演化

It's very interesting. People don't think that other animals love.
这很有趣。人们不认为其他动物会爱。

I've really looked at a lot of other animals, and they do love.
我确实观察过很多其他动物，它们确实会爱。

They do form romantic, I call it animal magnetism or animal romance.
它们确实会形成浪漫，我称之为动物磁性或动物浪漫。

And you can see a rat suddenly feel a very intense interest in another rat, only lasts for about 30 seconds.
你可以看到一只老鼠突然对另一只老鼠产生非常强烈的兴趣，但只持续大约30秒。

In elephants, it lasts for about five days. In foxes, it can last a long time.
在大象身上，它持续大约五天。在狐狸身上，它可以持续很长时间。

But most animals don't form a partnership.
但大多数动物不会形成伴侣关系。

They feel that intense attraction, animal attraction, animal magnetism.
它们感受到那种强烈的吸引力，动物吸引力，动物磁性。

And we now know that that attraction is basically the same brain system as our brain system of feelings of romantic love.
我们现在知道，那种吸引力基本上与我们感受浪漫爱情的大脑系统是相同的。

So other animals love. Darwin said that other animals love.
所以其他动物也会爱。达尔文说过其他动物也会爱。

He even thought that butterflies felt that attraction and that this was sort of, a primordial beginning of this attraction system that became incredibly elaborate in the human animal.
他甚至认为蝴蝶也感受到那种吸引力，这可以说是这种吸引力系统在人类动物身上变得极其复杂的原始开端。

But why is it that we bother to pair up?
但我们为什么会费心去结成伴侣呢？

All kinds of other animals feel romance, but it doesn't last very long.
各种其他动物都能感受到浪漫，但持续时间不长。

In humans, it can last months or years, actually.
在人类身上，它实际上可以持续数月甚至数年。

We've been able to prove that romantic love can last many years.
我们已经能够证明浪漫爱情可以持续很多年。

I think that the brain circuitry for human romantic love and feelings of deep attachment evolved probably 4.4 million years ago.
我认为人类浪漫爱情和深层依恋感的大脑回路可能在440万年前就进化出来了。

Our ancestors were being forced out of the trees. They were gonna have to come down onto the ground because the trees were disappearing and move through very dangerous open grasslands to another group of trees and collect what they could on the ground before they went to eat in a place unmolested by predators.
我们的祖先被迫离开树木。他们必须下到地面，因为树木正在消失，并且要穿过非常危险的开阔草原到另一片树林，在没有捕食者骚扰的地方进食之前，在地面上收集他们能找到的东西。

And with the beginning of carrying sticks and stones to protect themselves and food to eat, they began to have to walk on two legs instead of four.
随着他们开始携带木棍和石头来保护自己，以及携带食物，他们开始必须用两条腿而不是四条腿走路。

Chimpanzees walk on four legs, and they've got their baby on their back.
黑猩猩用四条腿走路，它们把宝宝背在背上。

We began to have to walk up on two legs instead of four, which meant that females began to have to carry their babies in their arms instead of on their backs.
我们开始必须用两条腿而不是四条腿走路，这意味着女性开始必须用手臂而不是背部抱着她们的婴儿。

Now, how is a four-million-year-old female gonna have to carry the equivalent of a 20-pound bowling ball in one arm and sticks and stones in the other and protect and feed herself?
那么，一个四百万年前的女性，如何能一只手臂抱着相当于20磅保龄球的婴儿，另一只手臂拿着木棍和石头，同时保护自己并寻找食物呢？

She began to need a partner to help protect her while she moved along.
她开始需要一个伴侣来帮助她在移动时保护她。

And how could a male, four million years ago, protect a whole group of females? He could protect one.
而四百万年前的雄性，如何能保护一整群雌性呢？他只能保护一个。

And so we went over what I call the **monogamy threshold** (Monogamy threshold: 演讲者提出的一个概念，指人类演化过程中，因女性育儿需求和男性保护需求，促使个体形成长期伴侣关系的关键点), a threshold in which the female needed a partner to help her raise her baby, at least through infancy.
所以我们跨越了我称之为**一夫一妻制门槛**，在这个门槛下，女性需要一个伴侣来帮助她抚养孩子，至少度过婴儿期。

And males needed to protect at least one female with his DNA in her.
而雄性需要保护至少一个体内带有他DNA的雌性。

And, of course, you know, females needed a male who wanted to stick around.
当然，女性需要一个愿意留在身边的雄性。

Those that didn't stick around didn't have the babies and didn't pass their DNA onto you and me, leaving in the human creature today, both men and women, with a tremendous capacity to fall in love, form a partnership, and raise their children as a team.
那些没有留下来的，就没有孩子，也没有把它们的DNA传给我们，这使得今天的人类，无论男女，都拥有巨大的能力去坠入爱河，形成伴侣关系，并作为一个团队抚养孩子。

So the bottom line is, along with that, we began to evolve our human brain pathways for human romantic love and feelings of deep attachment.
所以底线是，与此同时，我们开始进化出人类浪漫爱情和深层依恋感的大脑通路。

### 浪漫爱情的脑部扫描研究

So I began to believe that if I looked into the brain, I could find the brain circuitry of romantic love.
所以我开始相信，如果我深入研究大脑，我就能找到浪漫爱情的大脑回路。

So I assembled a team and began to put people in the scanner.
于是我组建了一个团队，开始将人们放入扫描仪中。

And the issue was how to scan the brain.
问题是如何扫描大脑。

And what I ended up with is the following protocol or research design.
我最终采用了以下方案或研究设计。

They would look at a picture of their sweetheart that called forth the wonderful feelings of romantic love.
他们会看一张让他们产生美妙浪漫爱情感觉的爱人照片。

And they would also look at a photograph of somebody who called forth no emotions, no positive or negative emotions.
他们还会看一张对他们来说没有任何情感，无论是积极还是消极情感的照片。

The problem with that is when you're madly in love with somebody, your emotions are gonna bleed from one picture to the other.
这样做的问题是，当你疯狂爱上某人时，你的情感会从一张照片“渗透”到另一张照片上。

So I had to relax the brain between looking at the neutral, the positive, and the neutral.
所以我必须在看中性照片、积极照片和中性照片之间让大脑放松下来。

So I used a very standard **psychological distraction task** (Psychological distraction task: 一种实验设计，通过引入无关任务来分散受试者注意力或重置认知状态).
所以我使用了一个非常标准的**心理干扰任务**。

I would cast on the screen a large number like 4,821, and I would ask them for 30 seconds to look at that photograph, that picture, and that number, and count backwards in increments of seven.
我会在屏幕上显示一个大数字，比如4821，然后我会要求他们在30秒内看着那张照片、那幅画和那个数字，并以7为增量倒数。

Now, even mathematicians take some time to count in increments of seven.
即使是数学家，也要花一些时间才能以7为增量倒数。

It takes all the blood away from brain regions linked with romantic love to brain regions linked with just simply counting backwards.
这会将所有血液从与浪漫爱情相关的大脑区域转移到仅仅与倒数相关的**大脑区域**。

So this way, they would bring a photograph of their sweetheart into the lab.
通过这种方式，他们会将爱人的照片带到实验室。

They would bring a neutral photograph, somebody from the office who they barely knew, somebody from the dry cleaners, some past friend of somebody who called forth no positive or negative feelings.
他们会带来一张中性照片，比如办公室里几乎不认识的人，干洗店里的人，或者某个过去的朋友，这些照片都不会引起任何积极或消极的情感。

So they would look at those two photographs.
所以他们会看这两张照片。

They would look at their sweetheart, then they would count backwards.
他们会看爱人的照片，然后倒数。

Then they would look at the neutral, then they would count backwards.
然后他们会看中性照片，然后倒数。

So it was: positive, count back, neutral, count back.
所以流程是：积极照片，倒数，中性照片，倒数。

A cycle of six times, 12 times, looking at these photographs.
重复这个循环六次、十二次，观看这些照片。

That way, we were able to capture through the **fMRI** (fMRI: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging: 一种神经影像技术，通过检测血流变化来测量大脑活动) machine how you felt when you have experienced that intense feeling of romantic love, what you were doing in the brain when you were counting backwards, and how you felt when you were simply looking at the neutral photograph.
通过这种方式，我们能够通过**功能性磁共振成像**（fMRI）机器捕捉到当你体验到那种强烈浪漫爱情时的感受，当你倒数时大脑正在做什么，以及当你仅仅看着中性照片时的感受。

And when you put the neutral and the romantic love on top of each other and cancel out what they have in common, you're left with what's going on in the brain when you're madly in love.
当你将中性照片和浪漫爱情的扫描结果叠加在一起，并抵消它们的共同之处时，剩下的就是你疯狂坠入爱河时大脑中发生的一切。

### 浪漫爱情的神经生物学基础：腹侧被盖区

I'll never forget the first moment that I looked at our data.
我永远不会忘记我第一次看到我们数据的那一刻。

I felt as if I was looking back to over four million years ago when this brain system evolved.
我感觉自己仿佛回到了四百多万年前，这个**大脑系统**刚刚进化出来的时候。

And what we saw was activity in a tiny little factory near the base of the brain called the **ventral tegmental area** (Ventral Tegmental Area: VTA: 大脑中产生多巴胺的区域，与奖励、动机和快感有关).
我们看到的是大脑底部一个微小“工厂”的活动，它被称为**腹侧被盖区**（VTA）。

It's a brain region that actually makes **dopamine** (Dopamine: 一种神经递质，在大脑的奖励系统中发挥关键作用，与愉悦、动机和运动控制相关), a natural stimulant, and gives you that focus, that motivation, the craving, the elation of intense romantic love.
这是一个实际产生**多巴胺**（一种天然兴奋剂）的**大脑区域**，它赋予你专注、动机、渴望以及强烈浪漫爱情的狂喜。

And, in fact, I was really surprised.
事实上，我真的很惊讶。

I had thought we would find all kinds of data, oh, linked with the emotions and linked with cognitive thinking processes.
我原以为我们会发现各种各样的数据，嗯，与情感和认知思维过程相关的。

We did find data linked with thinking processes and the emotions.
我们确实发现了与思维过程和情感相关的数据。

But no two people were alike, which is obvious; they'd be thinking about somebody else.
但没有两个人是完全相同的，这很明显；他们会思考不同的人。

But they all showed activity in this little factory near the base of the brain.
但他们都在大脑底部这个小“工厂”中显示出活动。

And I had thought that romantic love was an emotion or a series of emotions, but what it really is is a drive, a basic mating drive that evolved millions of years ago to enable you to focus your mating energy on a single individual and start the mating process.
我曾以为浪漫爱情是一种情感或一系列情感，但它实际上是一种驱动力，一种在数百万年前进化出来的基本求偶驱动力，使你能够将你的求偶能量集中在一个人身上，并开始求偶过程。

As a matter of fact, we now call it a **survival mechanism** (Survival mechanism: 生物为了生存和繁衍而发展出的行为、生理或心理适应).
事实上，我们现在称之为一种**生存机制**。

The basic brain region that generates the dopamine and gives you that feeling of romantic love lies right next to the factory that orchestrates thirst and hunger.
产生多巴胺并带给你浪漫爱情感觉的基本**大脑区域**，就位于调控口渴和饥饿的“工厂”旁边。

Thirst and hunger keep you alive today.
口渴和饥饿让你今天得以生存。

Romantic love enables you to focus your mating energy and drive your DNA into tomorrow.
浪漫爱情则让你能够集中求偶能量，并把你的DNA传承到明天。

So it's a basic survival mechanism that evolved millions of years ago, came out of nature, came out of other animals that feel it, but nowhere near to that degree.
所以它是一种在数百万年前进化出来的基本**生存机制**，源于自然，源于其他也能感受到它的动物，但程度远不及人类。

As a matter of fact, I think all three of these brain systems evolved in tandem.
事实上，我认为这三种**大脑系统**是协同进化的。

The sex drive evolved to get you out there looking for a whole range of partners.
**性冲动**的进化是为了让你去寻找各种各样的伴侣。

I mean, you can have sex with somebody when you're not in love with them.
我的意思是，你可以在不爱某人的时候与他们发生性关系。

Romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one at a time.
浪漫爱情的进化是为了让你一次只把求偶能量集中在一个人身上。

And attachment, that third brain system, evolved to enable you to stick with this person at least long enough to raise a single child through infancy.
而依恋，这第三个**大脑系统**，进化是为了让你能与这个人在一起足够长的时间，至少能抚养一个孩子度过婴儿期。

I was absolutely positive it was not a supernatural event.
我绝对肯定这不是一个超自然事件。

And so, no, I did not think about that person at that moment.
所以，不，我当时没有想那个人。

But I have been determined to show the world that this is real.
但我一直决心向世界证明这是真实存在的。

### 爱的拒绝：一种危险的成瘾

So many people suffer from it.
很多人因此受苦。

And as a matter of fact, you know, a lot of people came and wanted to talk to me, a lot of journalists, et cetera, after we discovered this data.
事实上，你知道，在我们发现这些数据后，很多人都来找我，很多记者等等。

And I thought to myself at the time, "You know, Helen, this really isn't very important."
当时我心想：“你知道吗，海伦，这其实并不是很重要。”

You know, when you're madly in love with the right person, there's no problem.
你知道，当你疯狂爱上对的人时，就没有问题。

The real problem is when you've been rejected in love.
真正的问题是当你被爱拒绝的时候。

That's when you turn into a pest, not only for all your friends and family, but it's a dangerous situation.
那时你就会变成一个麻烦，不仅对你的所有朋友和家人来说，而且这是一种危险的情况。

So I thought to myself, "Now what I've got to do is put people into the machine who've been rejected in love. That's where I can make a contribution to humanity."
所以我心想：“现在我必须做的是把那些在爱情中被拒绝的人放入机器中。那才是我能为人类做出贡献的地方。”

Well, then, my next study was putting people into the brain scanner who had just been rejected in love.
然后，我的下一个研究就是把那些刚在爱情中被拒绝的人放入**脑部扫描仪**中。

That was a lot harder because, you know, before I put people in this brain scanner, you really talk to them for a long time.
那要困难得多，因为，你知道，在我把人们放入这个**脑部扫描仪**之前，你真的要和他们聊很长时间。

You've gotta make sure that they are madly in love or that they are rejected in love because these machines are expensive, and it's extremely time-consuming.
你必须确保他们正疯狂坠入爱河，或者他们正被爱拒绝，因为这些机器很昂贵，而且非常耗时。

And I also have to tell them what's gonna go on in the machine.
而且我还必须告诉他们机器里会发生什么。

I've got to get them to bring me the correct pictures so it triggers the right response in the brain.
我必须让他们给我带来正确的照片，这样才能在大脑中触发正确的反应。

So I have long discussions with all of our subjects, our participants, before I put them in the machine.
所以，在把他们放入机器之前，我都会和我们所有的受试者、参与者进行长时间的讨论。

And when you've been rejected in love, one girl didn't show up for the scanning.
当你被爱拒绝时，一个女孩没有来参加扫描。

She had not been out of bed for almost four days.
她将近四天没有下床。

Another person cried so hard in the machine that we couldn't use the data.
另一个人在机器里哭得太厉害，以至于我们无法使用数据。

She moved too much.
她动得太多了。

Another person, after the scanning, came out of the machine and was so angry that he went home and, you know, drank too much.
另一个人在扫描结束后，走出机器时非常生气，以至于他回家后，你知道，喝了太多酒。

And so I began to realize very early, now I'm playing with something that is so powerful that I began to make sure that I walk with them for a while after the scan was over, that I called them that evening and the following morning to make sure that everything was all right.
所以我很早就开始意识到，我正在处理一些非常强大的东西，以至于我开始确保在扫描结束后陪他们走一段路，并在当天晚上和第二天早上给他们打电话，以确保一切都好。

This is when people kill themselves. This is when people kill somebody else.
这就是人们自杀的时候。这就是人们杀害别人的时候。

This is when they stalk. This is when they cry all night.
这就是他们跟踪的时候。这就是他们整夜哭泣的时候。

This is when they can slip into clinical depression.
这就是他们可能陷入**临床抑郁症**的时候。

So I thought it was an extremely important study. I still think it is.
所以我认为这是一项极其重要的研究。我仍然这样认为。

And I was determined to see whether rejection in love was actually an addiction.
我决心要看看爱情中的拒绝是否真是一种**成瘾**。

I had even thought that happy love was an addiction because, you know, when you're madly in love, you'll do the craziest things.
我甚至认为幸福的爱也是一种**成瘾**，因为，你知道，当你疯狂坠入爱河时，你会做出最疯狂的事情。

And sure enough, I was able to put 15 men and women into the scanner who had just been dumped.
果然，我成功地将15名刚被甩的男性和女性放入扫描仪中。

I was able to find activity in a lot of brain regions.
我能够发现许多**大脑区域**的活动。

One brain region is that same basic **ventral tegmental area** (VTA: 大脑中产生多巴胺的区域，与奖励、动机和快感有关), the VTA, that pumps out the dopamine that gives them the feeling of intense dramatic love.
其中一个**大脑区域**就是那个基本的**腹侧被盖区**（VTA），它泵出多巴胺，给他们带来强烈戏剧性爱情的感觉。

Also found activity in a brain region linked with deep feelings of attachment.
我还发现与深层依恋感相关**大脑区域**的活动。

You don't stop loving somebody when they've dumped you.
当他们甩了你，你并不会停止爱他们。

I found activity in a brain region linked with pain, with physical pain.
我发现与疼痛、与身体疼痛相关的**大脑区域**的活动。

It is a brain region that also becomes active when you have a toothache.
这是一个当你牙痛时也会变得活跃的**大脑区域**。

The difference between a toothache and intense rejection is the toothache goes away after you get to the dentist.
牙痛和强烈拒绝的区别在于，牙痛在你看牙医后就会消失。

And with rejection in love, you can feel that pain for months, maybe sometimes years.
而爱情中的拒绝，你可能会感到那种痛苦数月，有时甚至数年。

But most important, I found activity in three brain regions linked with craving and addiction specifically.
但最重要的是，我发现与渴望和**成瘾**特别相关的三个**大脑区域**的活动。

And what I was looking for is activity in a brain region called the **nucleus accumbens** (Nucleus Accumbens: 大脑奖励回路的关键组成部分，与动机、愉悦和成瘾行为密切相关).
我正在寻找的是一个名为**伏隔核**的**大脑区域**的活动。

It's the basic brain region that becomes active when you are addicted to cocaine, heroin, booze, alcohol, cigarettes, gambling, all of the addictions.
它是当你对可卡因、海洛因、酒、酒精、香烟、赌博——所有这些**成瘾**——上瘾时会变得活跃的基本**大脑区域**。

And so I was able to prove that romantic love when you are rejected is an addiction. It is a love addiction.
因此，我能够证明，当你在爱情中被拒绝时，浪漫爱情就是一种**成瘾**。它是一种爱情**成瘾**。

Then we went back, and we were able to find that people who were madly and happily in love were also addicted.
然后我们回溯，我们发现那些疯狂而幸福地坠入爱河的人也上瘾了。

We also found activity in this basic brain region, the **nucleus accumbens**.
我们还在这个基本的**大脑区域**——**伏隔核**中发现了活动。

So I'm trying to get the world to understand how important this brain system is.
所以，我正努力让世界理解这个**大脑系统**有多么重要。

You know, it's so interesting, some psychologists, you know, you'll go in and they'll say, "Well, just get rid of him. You know, he beats you up. Just get rid of him."
你知道，这很有趣，有些心理学家，你知道，你会去找他们，他们会说：“哦，甩了他吧。你知道，他会打你。甩了他就是了。”
