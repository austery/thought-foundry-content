### AI原生团队的定义与影响

**Gerge**: 当我们组织这次活动时，我们只是想回答当时我们面临的最重要的问题。那是在五个月前，我们认为其中一些可能与AI有关，但结果是AI无处不在。所以，我不想拐弯抹角。你们两位在很多方面都非常相似，你们都曾管理或正在管理大型组织，你们都在打造开发者喜爱、使用并积极参与的品牌。**Thomas**，你现在正在开始一个全新的事业，做一些完全不同的事情。那么，一个AI优先或**AI原生团队**对你来说意味着什么？我先从你，**Rajie**开始。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gerge**: When we organized this event, we just wanted to look at the most important questions that we are facing at that time. And this was 5 months ago, and we thought some of it might be AI, but it turned out to be AI is everywhere. So I'm not going to beat around the bush. The two of you are very similar in many ways. You've run or are running large organizations. You're building brands that developers love and use and are engaged with. Thomas, you're now starting something completely new. So, you're also doing something completely different. What is an AI first or AI native team mean to you? And I'll start with you Rajie.

</details>

**Rajie**: 当然。首先，**Gerge**，谢谢你邀请我，也谢谢大家的到来。这里的能量真是显而易见。所以，能来到这里并谈论AI原生事物，我感到非常高兴。现在每个人都想谈论AI，这很有趣。那么，一个AI原生团队是什么样的呢？嗯，首先，它始于心态。你必须真正相信AI原生工作，并与**智能体**（agents）等合作。在**Atlassian**，我们有一些工程团队，其中一些仍然以更传统的方式编写和构建软件，因为我们确实有需要这种方式的遗留系统。但我们也有许多AI原生团队，那里的工程师基本上不写代码，一切都由智能体完成，是智能体的编排。我们发现，产品经理（PM）、设计和工程之间的界限正在模糊，产品经理和设计师都在编写代码。这基本上普遍提高了生产力。我发现团队不一定变小，但他们有时能产出2倍到5倍甚至更多的成果，而且创造力也提高了。你构建的东西更具创造性，你可以放入事物的截图，设计更现代的用户体验（UX）。而且，产品经理、设计师和工程师之间的距离也在缩小，这促成了更活跃的对话和更多的创造力。我认为，关于使用AI来提高效率、可能缩小团队规模和减少工程师数量的讨论，都忽略了重点。更重要的是，你现在可以用AI创造出以前无法创造的东西，以及如何才能变得更高效、获得更多乐趣。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rajie**: Sure. First of all, Gerge, thank you for inviting me and thanks everyone for coming. The energy here is just palpable. So it's really great to be here and I'm really excited to be talking about AI native stuff. Everyone wants to talk about AI these days. So it's fun. But what does an AI native team look like? Well, first of all, it starts with the mindset, right? You have to sort of really believe in doing AI native work and working with agents and things like that. We have teams at **Atlassian** engineering teams, some of which are still doing the more traditional way of coding and building software because we do have legacy systems that take that. But we have a number of AI native teams where engineers are basically writing zero lines of code. It's all agents. It's orchestration of agents. What we are finding is the lines are blurring between PM, design and engineering where PMs are writing code, designers are writing code. This is basically leading to more productivity generally speaking. And the thing I find is that the teams are not necessarily getting smaller but they are producing a lot more sometimes 2x 5x more and the creativity is going up. What you build is is much more creative. You can put in like screenshots of things and design you know more modern UX and and then you can also between PMs, designs and engineers the the distance is shrinking as well. So that's making for more vigorous conversation and more creativity. I find that the discussion about using AI to produce more efficiency and maybe smaller teams and fewer engineers is missing the point. It's more about what can you create now with AI that you could not create before and how can you be that much more productive and how can you have that much more joy.

</details>

**Thomas**: 我认为这有多种答案，**Rajie**已经给出了其中一个。如果我将**AI原生**这个词与**云原生**（cloud native）放在相同的语境中思考，那么当**GitHub**在2008年成立时，没有人谈论云原生。这是一个事后才引入的术语，用来识别所有这些公司如何重新发明了部署和开发系统的方式。我认为AI原生也会是这样。我们现在所称的AI原生，与几年后的AI原生将会非常不同。我有两个儿子，一个13岁，一个11岁，他们大部分时间都在玩**Minecraft**。有时我也可以说服他们写代码，但他们无疑是AI原生的。一两年前，他们有一天回家，给我看他们的手机，主屏幕上有一些小狗的图片，他们用**Adobe Firefly**生成了这些图片。我当时想，你们是怎么找到**Adobe Firefly**的？哦，学校里每个人都在用。我认为这就是AI原生一代，那些现在伴随这些智能体成长起来的孩子。对他们来说，使用智能体将是如此自然，而不是去**Google**搜索，或者尝试用传统方式寻找答案。我认为，如果我们都对自己诚实，就会发现有很多关于日常工作如何AI原生、如何一切都用智能体的说法。我是一个初创公司创始人，大部分时间我仍然在处理人力资源系统、月末结账、获取董事会保险等事务，那是一个我必须填写的表格。没有任何智能体能帮我解决这些问题。如果你在播客中听到这些，我就会想：“当然，当然，当然。”理论上那是我的生活，但实际上，昨天我们宣布了我的公司成立。从那时起，我收到了数百封来自投资者的邮件，他们仍然想在种子轮进行天使投资。那些拥有12年经验、地球上最优秀的开发者，却给我发邮件申请工作。我正在寻找能为我解决所有这些问题的智能体，而不是仅仅想办法如何既能友善地回复他们，又能让他们知道我现在对这种对话不感兴趣，因为我想建立一家公司。所以我认为，这就是当今软件开发中AI原生团队的核心。是的，我们将使用**云代码**或某个智能体来构建代码，但我们不会将**Markdown**文件输入其中。让3000名软件工程师都在**Markdown**上协作，那简直是噩梦。如果你有德国人、西班牙人、印度人、中国人等等，他们的英语不那么流利，那甚至是个更糟糕的噩梦，因为编程语言很棒，它将词汇量减少到大约20个每个人都能说的词。一旦你必须用一种你实际不思考的语言来描述一个功能，那真的非常困难。我认为我们还没有解决这些问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Thomas**: I think there's multiple answers to this. Rajie gave one of them. If I think about the word AI native in the same context as cloud native, when **GitHub** started in 2008, nobody spoke about cloud native. It is a term that was introduced after the fact after in identifying how all these companies reinvented how they're deploying and and and developing systems. And I think the same is going to be true for AI native. What we're calling AI native now is going to be very different than what is going to be AI native in a few years. And I have two two boys 13 and 11 and most of the time they're playing **Minecraft**. Sometimes I can also convince them to code but certainly they are AI native. One day they came home, I think it was a year or two ago, and they showed me their cell phones and they had like puppy images on the on the front p on the home screen and they use **Adobe Firefly** to generate these images. And I'm like, how the hell did you find **Adobe Firefly**? Oh, everybody in school is using it. And I think that's the AI native generation, those that are growing up now with these agents. For them, it will be just so natural to use an agent instead of going to, you know, a **Google** search or I mean trying to find it to do the the traditional way. And I think if we're all honest to ourselves, there's a lot of sorry out there of how all dayto-day is a native and I'm using agents for everything. I'm a startup founder. Most of the time I'm still dealing with HR systems and my my month and close and getting, you know, uh, directors of board insurance and that's a form that I have to fill out. No agent helps me with any of that. And if you hear that in podcast, I'm like, "Sure, sure, sure." You know, like in theory that is my life. But in reality, yesterday we announced my company. Since then, I got like hundreds of emails from investors that want to absolutely still angel invest into the seat round. People that have 12 years of experience are the best developers, you know, on the planet, yet they're sending me an email to to apply for a job. And and I'm I'm looking for the agent that solves all that for me instead of just trying to figure out how can I be both nice human to give them response, but also let them know that I'm not interested in, you know, that conversation right now because I want to build a company. So I think that's the like the the crux of AI native teams today in a software development. Yes, we're going to use cloud code or or some agent to build code, but no, we're not going to feed Markdown files into that. Like 3,000 software engineers all collaborating on markdown, that is a nightmare, right? If you have then folks in Germany, you know, that speak English with an accent or in Spain or in India and China and whatnot that don't actually are as fluent in English, it's actually an even worse nightmare because programming language is great. It reduces vocabulary on like 20 words that everybody can speak. As soon as you have to describe a feature in a language that you don't actually think in, it's really really hard. And I think we haven't figured any of that out.

### AI如何改变开发工作流

**Gerge**: 那么，你们的团队现在是如何使用工具的？他们的工作流程发生了怎样的变化？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gerge**: And how are your teams today using tools? How have their workflows changed?

</details>

**Thomas**: 我认为工作流程最大的变化是，现在大多数从头开始开发新项目并使用**云代码**的开发者，他们会强迫自己不看代码。这基本上是从...

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Thomas**: I think the biggest change in the workflow is that you basically most developers that start Greenfield from scratch today and and have used cloud code is that they force themselves to not look at the code. And that basically it starts with...

</details>

**Gerge**: 这在你们的团队中正在发生吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gerge**: That that's happening at your teams right?

</details>

**Thomas**: 我认为这在整个行业都在发生，我面试过的所有人，无论他们是在**Microsoft**、**GitHub**、**Atlassian**、**ThoughtWorks**还是**Block**工作。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Thomas**: That's happening. I think that's happening everywhere in the industry like in all the people I'm interviewing whether they work at **Microsoft** **GitHub** or **Atlassian** or **ThoughtWorks** or or **Block** or so.

</details>

**Gerge**: 别挖墙脚啊。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gerge**: Easy with the poaching there.

</details>

**Thomas**: 呃，他们都来找我。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Thomas**: Well, I'm all coming to me, you know.

</details>

**Gerge**: 好的，**Thomas**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gerge**: But all Thomas, yeah.

</details>

**Thomas**: 呃，我的初创公司大约三分之一的团队是澳大利亚人，因为其中一位联合创始人是在东柏林和我一起读高中，然后移民到澳大利亚的。所以澳大利亚媒体昨天在宣布消息时，没有放过这个机会对**Atlassian**进行一番评论，因为你们的股价下跌了，等等，这和我们无关。但当然，媒体就是这样运作的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Thomas**: Well, you know, a third about a third of the our team of my startup entire is Australian because one of the co-founders is actually went to high school with me in East Berlin and then immigrated to Australia. And so the Australian press didn't let that opportunity go to a little bit on **Atlassian** yesterday when the announcement came because your stock price is down and whatnot has nothing to do with us. But of course, you know, that's not how the press works.

</details>

**Gerge**: 都是些悲伤的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gerge**: It's all the sad stuff, you know.

</details>

**Thomas**: 是的。总之，我刚才说到哪里了？嗯，想要成为AI原生的开发者，他们正在尝试尽可能少地看代码，并强迫自己通过**提示**和**推理过程**来解决问题，并表达意图。然后，代码审查也是一样，理想情况下，我从不逐行阅读代码，因为那会成为越来越大的瓶颈。我使用像**Cursor Composer**或其中一个工具来指出错误，我正在等待那个时刻，我认为之前的会议也提到了这一点，那就是让**代码审查机器人**或**智能体**与**编码智能体**协同工作。为什么还需要人类介入其中呢？我认为，这就是目前大多数AI原生开发者所处的状态，他们已经找到了如何做到这一点，这本身就是一种技能。我认为这回答了我们是否会用智能体取代人类的问题。不，我们正在提升人类，让他们成为这些智能体的主人。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Thomas**: Yeah. Anyway, where was I? Developers that want to be AI native, what they're doing is try to look at little as code as possible and force yourselves to figure it out with a prompt and a reasoning process and and voicing intent, right? And then same way with code review ideally, you know, I never read the code line by line because that's going to become increasing bottleneck. I have like **Cursor Composer** or or one of these tools point out the mistakes to me and I'm waiting for the moment and I think a previous session alluded to this that let's just have the code review bot or agent work with the coding agent. Why would you need the human in the middle of that? And I think that's where that the what the the most AI native developers are right now is the ones that have figured out how to do that and that is a skill in itself and that's I think answering the question are we going to replace humans with agents? No, we are upleveling the humans to become the the masters of these of these agents. Yeah.

</details>

**Rajie**: 关于工具，我认为有两部分。一是**编码**和**实现**变得越来越自由，以至于瓶颈正在转移到我所说的“代码左侧”和“代码右侧”。在代码左侧，是关于规划和规范。在这方面，**Atlassian**越来越多地使用的一个工具是**Confluence**，因为**Confluence**是意图和规范所在的地方。是的，它主要是英语，**Thomas**关于语言的观点很好，但那是你真正投入你想要构建的东西的地方，特别是对于面向产品的工程师，他们会投入大量的评论，而我们的智能体能够阅读这些评论，然后进入一个循环并解决问题，这真的很棒。但是的，代码左侧，然后代码右侧是标准的东西：**CI/CD**、部署、事件，你如何发现这些？所以使用智能体来做这些就是我们正在做的事情。所以我会说，我们正在从整体上审视整个**软件开发生命周期**（SDLC），我们称之为**AI原生SDLC**，从构思到编码再到生产部署，我们正在相当大地改变工具集。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rajie**: And on tools I think like there's two parts to it right. Is that coding and implementation is becoming free to the point where the bottleneck is shifting to what I call the left of code and the right of code on the left of code it's about planning and specking and there increasingly one of the tools we are using in **Atlassian** a lot is **Confluence** because **Confluence** is where the intent and the spec and yes it's mostly English language and Thomas makes a good point about language but that's where you are putting in really what you want to build especially for product oriented engineers they're going in and putting in a lot of comments and our agents are able to read the comments and go off in a Ralph loop and you know solve things which is really amazing. But yeah, left of code and then right of code it's the standard stuff **CI/CD** deployment incidents sees how do you find that out so using agents to do that is is what we're doing so I'd say we are looking at it holistically across the entire **software development life cycle** we call it the **AI native SDLC** all the way from ideation to coding to like deployment in production we we are changing the tool set quite a bit.

</details>

**Gerge**: 好的，那**RoboDev**呢？告诉我**RoboDev**是什么。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gerge**: Okay, what about **RoboDev**? Tell me what **RoboDev** is.

</details>

**Rajie**: 是的，是的，是的，**RoboDev**是一个**编码智能体**，但它也是我们用于在整个**SDLC**中做事情的品牌。所以我们用它进行**代码审查**，我们用它进行**CI/CD**，我们用它进行**事件解决**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rajie**: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So **RoboDev** is a coding agent but it's also our brand for like doing things across the entire SDLC. So we using it for code reviews, we're using it for CI/CD, we are using it for incident resolution.

</details>

**Gerge**: 那么，你们构建了自己的编码智能体。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gerge**: So you built your own coding agent.

</details>

**Rajie**: 是的。有趣的是，我们使用的是**Anthropic**的模型。但在基准测试中，我们实际上击败了**PlotCode**。这听起来很神奇。你们是如何使用他们的模型做到这一点的？嗯，这归结为一个神奇的词：**上下文**。智能体和你给它的上下文一样聪明。在**Atlassian**，我们构建了一个名为**团队协作图谱**（teamwork graph）的东西，它能知道**Thomas**与谁在哪个**PR**、哪个**Jira**问题上合作。这个上下文确实帮助**RoboDev**在**PR**方面做得更好。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rajie**: Yes. Now here interesting thing is we are using **Anthropic's model**. But in the benchmark we actually beat **PlotCode**. Which is sounds amazing. How does how do you do that using their model? Well, it comes down to one magic word which is context. Agents are as smart as the context you give. And in **Atlassian** we have built what is called the **teamwork graph** which is you know who does Thomas work with on which PR on which issue in **Jira** and that context really helps Rob do a much better job with the PR it produces.

</details>

### 分布式团队与AI的协同效应

**Gerge**: 分布式团队发生了什么？**Thomas**，你提到你的团队分布在不同的时区，这对于一个早期初创公司来说非常不寻常。通常的传统观念是，大家在同一个办公室里，可以互相交流。你为什么决定采用分布式模式？AI与此有关系吗？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gerge**: What is happening with distributed teams? Thomas, you mentioned that your team is spread across a bunch of different time zones which is super unusual for a early stage startup usually the conventional wisdom is like be in the same office you're going to be riffing at the each. Why did you decide to go distributed and does AI have to do anything with this?

</details>

**Thomas**: 首先，我想说，我坚信每个人都需要找到自己的幸福。就像你个人生活中的关系一样，你与公司的关系也是如此。没有一种完美的方法。如果你想在旧金山一家拥有漂亮办公室的公司工作，那很好。如果你想在混合模式下工作，也很好。我喜欢在远程团队中工作，因为我喜欢旅行。我喜欢24/7的覆盖，如果你在澳大利亚、德国、西班牙、里斯本、英国，或者美国的不同时区都有人。这让我的生活感到快乐，这并不意味着其他人在管理公司的方式上是错误的。不过，如果你有一个远程团队，你可能会感到孤独。这种孤独可能是在家独自一人的感觉，也可能是在“谁可以回答我的问题”方面的孤独。在办公室环境中做到这一点要容易得多，因为你可以大致判断，**Gerley**只是在**X**上冲浪、发帖等等，所以我可以问他一个问题。而且，如果你正忙着和**Rajie**交谈，我显然不会冲进会议室问你：“嘿，你能帮我做这个代码审查吗？”我认为智能体基本上为我们提供了这些**陪练伙伴**、这些**专家**，我可以直接问他们：“嘿，我想就这个话题进行头脑风暴，我需要写一个**ADR**或者解决一个问题。”周末我正在准备一个发布，我发现我不仅需要**服务条款**和**隐私政策**，还需要**Cookie政策**。所以我当时正在想如何在**React**应用中实现这一点，我只是让**Cursor Composer**帮我做了，三秒钟就完成了。我认为，远程工作在智能体的帮助下达到了一个新的水平，这在以前是不可能的，因为我总有人可以求助：我的**代码审查智能体**、我的**编码智能体**、我的**头脑风暴智能体**、我的**研究智能体**，所有这些。我认为这对我们来说是一个巨大的好处，特别是当你遇到发布日的时候。如果每个人都在同一个时区、同一个办公室，总有一天你需要回家，这是现实。如果你在澳大利亚有同事，当这里是下午6点时，墨尔本可能才中午左右，所以他们仍在工作，并保持在**Discord**和开源项目上的参与。我认为在某些方面，智能体再次为远程优先团队带来了优势，而其他在办公室一起工作的团队，当他们可以在白板前头脑风暴时，他们拥有自己的优势。智能体在一定程度上弥合了这种竞争劣势，这种劣势在旧金山确实有所发展，因为大多数AI原生公司都回到了办公室。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Thomas**: First of all, I want to say, I'm a strong believer of everybody needs to find their own happiness, right? And there's just similar to the relationship that you have in your personal life, it's same with the relationship you have with your company. There is not one perfect approach. And if you want to work in a company that has a beautiful office in San Francisco, great. You want to work in a hybrid scenario, also great. And I love working in remote teams because I love traveling. I love the 247 coverage if you have people in Australia, in Germany, in Spain, in Lisbon and UK, whatever in in in United States in the different time zones. And that makes my life happy and doesn't mean that anybody else is wrong in in how they're running the company. What it does though is if you have a remote team is that you're lonely, right? And lonely in might be in the kind of like co alone at home sense, but also in the who is available for me to ask the question. And it's much easier to do that in an office environment because you can kind of figure out well Gerley is only surfing on **X** and and and posting and whatnot and so I can ask him a question and never never and and in the same time if you're busy in a conversation with Rajie then obviously I won't run into the conference room and ask you hey can you do this code review for me and I think agents basically gave us these bearings partners these experts that I can just ask and say hey I want to brainstorm on this topic I need to write an **ADR** or like solve a problem. I was over the weekend preparing a launch. So, I figured out I need not only a terms of service and a privacy policy, I also need a cookie policy. So, I was trying to figure out how do I do that in the **React** app and I just asked **Cursor Composer** to do that for me and it was done in 3 seconds, right? And I think that's the the remote work with the help of agent has gotten a new level that wasn't possible before because I have always somebody available my code review agent my coding agent know my brainstorming agent my research agents all these kind of things and then I and I think that's for us the huge benefit especially if you have these launch days right if you everybody in the same time zone in the same office at some point you need to go home like that's just the reality if you have folks in Australia by the time it's 6 p.m. here it's like noon or something in Melbourne and so they're still working and maintaining you know the engagement on **Discord** and and the open source project. I think in some ways you know agents have gotten as an advantage again you know for being remote first and that you know other teams that work in the office together you know have on on their side when when they can brainstorm in front of whiteboard. It evened out a little bit of the competitive disadvantage that certainly has evolved here in San Francisco as most of the AI native companies have gotten back into office.

</details>

**Rajie**: 是的。嗯，**Atlassian**实际上早在疫情之前就已经倾向于分布式团队了。所以当疫情真正发生时，对我们来说，处于那种情况是非常自然的。我们的软件天生就是为了分布式团队之间的协作而设计的，我们不是纯远程公司。我们有办公室，在旧金山、悉尼以及世界各地都有办公室。所以我们确实相信人类聚集在一起工作时所获得的**有意识的凝聚力**。所以我们不是那种纯远程或远程优先的公司。但我们不强制你来办公室，我们允许你可以在任何地方工作。我们称之为“**团队无界**”（team anywhere）。你可以在任何地方工作，与任何人合作。关于**Thomas**的观点，我认为智能体改变了很多事情。我记得以前在办公室凌晨两点写代码，卡住了，你所能做的就是一遍又一遍地阅读代码，直到你理解并解决问题。现在你可以问一个智能体，智能体可以为你解释，甚至更好地为你编写代码。所以我认为有了智能体，我们以这种方式进行分布式工作变得更好、更容易了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rajie**: Yeah. Well, we have we are actually **Atlassian** has been leaning into distributed teams way before like even before COVID. So when actually co happened it was super natural for us to to be in that kind of situation. Our software naturally is for collaboration across distributed teams that we're not remote. We have offices. We have offices in San Francisco, in Sydney, in in different parts of the world. So we do believe in like that intentional togetherness you get when human beings come together and and work together. So we're not like a remote only, remote first kind of company. But we don't mandate you coming into the office. We like you can work from anywhere. We call it **team anywhere**. You can work from anywhere. You can work with people. And to Thomas's point, I think agents have changed things a lot. Like I remember the days when I was in the office at 2 a.m. writing code and you get stuck and all you can do is like read the code and read the code more until you understand it and figure it out. Well now you can ask an agent and the agent can explain it for you or even better do the code for you. So I think with agents it's gotten even better and easier for us to be able to be distributed in this in this fashion.

### 工程师与领导者角色的演变

**Gerge**: 你们都看到了，软件工程师的角色正在改变，工程领导者、工程经理的角色也在改变。从你们的角度来看，目前正在发生什么？你们期望会发生什么？特别是考虑到**Atlassian**，你们是否在定义角色或放宽一些以前的规定方面做出了改变？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gerge**: And you know like a big thing that we're all seeing you're seeing it as well the role of software engineer changing and the role of the engineing leader the engineing manager changing from your vantage point what are you seeing happening so far what do you expect and especially looking at **Atlassian** are are you are you doing any change in in terms of like defining the role or thinking about or relaxing some of the things that you've kind of had had in place before? Yeah, we we think about it in terms of like uh what changes with respect to ownership, accountability, things like that, right?

</details>

**Rajie**: 是的，我们从**所有权**、**责任**等方面来思考这些变化。我们发现，现在代码所有权的重要性降低了。现在，**工件**（artifacts）正在转向**Confluence**、**Jira**甚至**Loom**等工具。我们通过收购的产品**Loom**进行了大量的互动，它现在是**Atlassian**的产品，你可以通过视频表达更多的意图和想法。所以，将这些输入到我们的AI智能体中，并用它来生成更好的工件。所有权正在向这方面转移，同时责任部分也在增加。不再是大量的代码审查，试图理解代码是否良好（你仍然需要这样做，但智能体会帮助你），而是关于**验证**。你需要什么**护栏**？你想要验证哪些**输入和输出**，以确保AI代码是好的，智能体做得很好？这就是所有权和责任正在转移的地方。我们是这样思考的。但在团队结构、经理、产品经理、设计师和工程师方面，我们还没有考虑进行激进的改变。我们关注的是团队结构，即生产功能的团队，他们如何能做得更多？如何能更具创造力？我们不会走“用更少的人来做”这条路。那不是最重要的。在某些情况下，我们确实发现生产力提高了10倍甚至100倍，然后我们会为此重塑团队。但我们的角度更多是：如何释放更多的创造力？如何做得更多？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rajie**: Yeah, we we think about it in terms of like what changes with respect to ownership, accountability, things like that, right? And what we're finding is it's less about code ownership. It's more about like now the artifacts are shifting to things like **Confluence** and **Jira** and even **Loom**. We have a lot of interaction through a product we acquired called **Loom** that's now partian product and you can express a lot more intent and thoughts and video and so feeding that into our AI agents and using that to produce better artifacts. The ownership is shifting towards that and then the accountability part is increasing as well instead of like a lot of code reviews and trying to understand whether the code is good which you still have to do but the agents help you it's about verification right what are the guardrails what are the inputs and outputs that you want to verify that so that you know that the AI code is good and that the agents have done a good job that's where the ownership and accountability is shifting and so that's that's how we are thinking about it but in terms of team structures and managers and PMs and designers and engineers we aren't thinking we're not doing like radical changes yet. What we are focusing on is that team structure, that team that's producing the feature. How can they do more? How can they be more creative? We're not going down the path of saying, "Oh, let's do it, you know, with fewer people necessarily." That's not the biggest thing. In some cases, we do find 10x even 100x more productivity and we then reshape the team for that. But our angle is more how do you unleash more creativity and how do you do more?

</details>

**Gerge**: 你能再详细解释一下，当你提到生产力提高并为此重塑团队时，那可能意味着什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gerge**: Can you tell me a tiny bit more when you say like you see more productivity team and you reshape the team for that? What could that mean or what does that mean?

</details>

**Rajie**: 嗯，我们尝试了一些项目，我们想：“嘿，如果我们不手动编写任何代码会怎样？”那会是什么样子？对吧？那会迫使你以不同的方式思考，迫使你以不同的方式组织代码库，迫使你以不同的方式设置智能体的规则。当代码库充满了代码时，智能体没有足够的上下文，它可以在一个更好的起点开始。所以这迫使你真正做到AI原生、AI优先。我们发现，在这些情况下，我们取得了很大的进展。你可以获得非常好的生产力。但如果你有一个存在已久的**遗留代码库**，那就没那么容易了。我们发现，这需要更多的努力等等。所以我们在**RoboDev**方面取得了很大的进展，但它还没有达到你可以给它一个复杂的遗留代码库项目的程度。我认为这是一个很多人都在努力解决的难题。我认为我们很快就会达到那个目标，但那是一个你不能那么激进的领域。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rajie**: Well, we've tried some projects where we are like, hey, what if we didn't write any code manually? Like what does that look like? Right? And that forces you to think differently. That forces you to organize a repo differently. That forces you to set up the rules for the agents differently. The agents don't have enough context. When you have a repo with full of code, it can start off in a better place. And so that forces you to sort of really be AI native AI first. And we're finding that in those cases, we make a lot of progress. You can get real good productivity. But if you have a legacy codebase that has been around for a long time, it's not as easy, right? We find that, you know, it takes a lot more effort and things like that. And so we have done a lot of progress with **RoboDev**, but it's not yet at the point where you can give it like a complex project on a legacy codebase. And I think that's a hard problem that a lot of people are working on. I think we'll get there very soon, but that's an area where you can't go and and be as aggressive.

**Thomas**: 是的，我有两个角度。我认为，我们总是面临一个问题，那就是生活中有太多想法，有太多事情要做。我的一个笑话是，当你单身时，你的周六早上很棒，你对周末有所有的计划。当你结婚生子后，你周六早上所有的计划到周日晚上都没有实现，因为你的家人决定了你周末实际要做什么。在软件项目中也是如此。我们解决这个问题的方式是把事情写进**待办事项列表**，然后把它们移到**线性积压**中。你的积压会越来越长，然后有人就会把它们全部扔掉，重新开始，再次提出相同的想法。我们现在用智能体做的是，我们把这向前推了一步，我们把所有这些都输入到智能体中，智能体编写所有的代码，现在你有了积压和**拉取请求**。现在瓶颈就在这里了，因为你无法审查所有这些代码。然后会有智能体来审查所有这些代码，并自动合并和自动部署。你得到的就是**霍默·辛普森**（Homer Simpsons）的车，对吧？因为你所有的想法，在没有任何流程、任何创造力、任何产品管理等等的情况下，会导致产品拥有大量功能，看起来就像霍默·辛普森。我不知道大家脑海里有没有那张图。另一方面是，我们仍然需要产品经理、设计师和工程师来实际架构出真正出色的产品。每次你使用一个不好的产品时，你就会知道，情况就是这样，对吧？我们更容易发现不好的东西，而不是好的东西。与此同时，我认为我们将看到传统工程角色之间的大规模**角色融合**。你不再是务实的产品经理和产品设计师，但我实际上认为产品经理正在成为**产品工程师**，设计师正在成为**设计工程师**，而软件工程师仍然是软件工程师。所以这些角色的**维恩图**（ven diagram）重叠得更多了。我认为这是今天早上的会议，或者昨天非公开会议上提到的，我们看到很多这样的情况：公司里的产品经理现在被迫（作为他们工作的一部分）使用**编码智能体**来构建原型，而不是仅仅编写文档然后移交给别人。这是显而易见的部分，但对于你的营销人员、公关人员、助理也同样适用。所有这些人都在使用**Lovable**或**Rippl.it**或任何这些工具来自动化他们生活的一部分。然后问题就变成了，是像**Phoenix项目**中那样阻止所有人部署的“坏警察”，还是我们找到方法让组织中的每个人都能成为**构建者**，并为最终每个组织的目标做出贡献，那就是作为一个团队，我们比作为个体强大得多。这就是**荷兰贸易公司**的哲学，如果你追溯公司的起源。我们必须找到这些流程，我认为这就是我们还没有真正弄清楚的地方：如何以安全、值得信赖的方式，通过更快地推进生命周期，同时赋能公司中的每个人，来交付出色的产品。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Thomas**: Yeah. I have two angles on this. I think one is, you know, we we're constantly in this problem that we have way too many ideas in life and way too many things to do. You know, one of my jokes is that when you're single, your Saturday morning is great. You have all the plans for the weekend. When you're married with kids, all the plans that you had on Saturday morning didn't happen by Sunday night because your family determined what you're actually doing over the weekend. And the same is true in software projects. And the way we're solving this is we're writing things down in **to-do lists** and we're moving them into **linear backlogs**. And your backlog gets longer and longer and somebody just throw it all away and start fresh and bring up the same ideas again. And what we're now doing with agents, we're shifting this one step to the right where we just feed all of that into agents and agents write all the code and now you have your backlog and your **pull requests**. And there's the bottleneck now because you can't review all of that. And then are going to be agents that review all that code and auto merge and auto deploy it. And what you get is the **Homer Simpsons car**, right? Because all the ideas you had, without without any process and any creativity and and and product management and whatnot leads to products that have lots of features that look like Homer Simpson. I don't everybody has that picture in your head. The the flip side of that is, you know, that and then obviously we need to so that we still need product managers and designers and engineers to actually architect products that are really great. And every time you're using a product that's not great, you know, exactly that that's the case, right? Like that's it's easier for us to find something bad than finding something good. At the same time, I think we're seeing going to see a massive role collapse between the traditional engineering roles, right? You're not the pragmatic product product manager and the product designer, but I actually think the product manager is becoming a **product engineer** and the designer is becoming a **design engineer** and the software engineer stays a software engineer. And so the **ven diagram** of these roles is overlapping much more. I think it was this morning's session or maybe it was the off the record session yesterday, but we're seeing a lot of that where product managers in companies are now forced to as an as an expectation of their job to use a coding agent to build a prototype instead of just writing a document and handing it off. Now that's the obvious part of this, but it's also true for your marketer, for your coms people, for your assistant. All those folks are already using **Lovable** or **Rippl.it** or any of these tools to actually automate part of their life. And then the question becomes is it the bad cop like in the I think it was in the **Phoenix project** that blocks everybody from deploying or do we find ways in the organizations to actually let everybody be a builder and and contribute to back to what ultimately is the goal of every organization which is as a team together we are much more powerful than as individuals right that's the **Dutch trading company** philosophy if if you go back where companies come from and we have to find these processes and I think that's the thing that we haven't really figured out of how in a secure way and trustworthy A we can ship amazing products, you know, by moving much faster through the life cycle while at the same time empowering everybody in the company to to do so.

</details>

**Gerge**: 我们已经讨论了工程师的角色，以及设计师和产品经理如何变得更紧密。那么工程领导者呢？你们在**Atlassian**有很多杰出的工程领导者，你认为他们的角色会如何改变？**Thomas**，当你招聘时，你会招聘什么样的人？以前你可能每10个工程师就会招聘一个工程经理。这对你来说会如何改变？我先从你，**Rajie**开始。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gerge**: And we we've talked about this is the engineer role and of course like how the designers and and product managers are getting closer. What about the engineering leader? You know, you you've got a lot of outstanding engineering leaders inside at Lash and how do you see their roles changing and you know Thomas like as you're going to be hiring, who would you hire for? Like before you would have obviously hired for every 10 engineers like an engine manager or something like that. How how will that change for you? So I'll I'll start off with you Rajie.

</details>

**Rajie**: 是的，我认为对包括我在内的工程领导者来说，最令人兴奋的事情之一就是我们现在可以编写更多的代码了。我喜欢编写代码。假期里，我买了一台笔记本电脑，因为有时你无法安装某些东西，但我买了我的个人笔记本电脑，在**Apple Store**安装了**云代码**，然后构建了一个应用程序，还有一堆**Python**脚本之类的东西。对于一个从小写代码的人来说，我对自己的代码要求非常高，就像我对所有工程师的要求一样。所以对我来说，在传统的旧方式下，花时间去构建一个全新的功能需要很多时间，但现在有了**RoboDev**、有了智能体等等，我可以更快地完成。参加**黑客马拉松**，构建一些东西，编写代码，总是令人满足的。所以对于所有的领导者来说，我认为这就像是，你可以获得更多的联系。因为有时作为领导者，你往上走，然后就会与代码和工程师越来越疏远，现在我认为这个差距正在缩小。另一个有趣的变化是**管理幅度**（span of control）正在改变。我一直提倡一种退化的情况，那就是你有一个400人的工程师团队，你取400的平方根，基本上你有20个直接下属，每个人又有20个直接下属，这样就只有两层管理。但通常大多数组织的人只有三到五个下属，最退化的情况是二叉树，两个下属、两个下属，一直往下。但我认为管理幅度会增加。**Tibo**提到过有33个直接下属，**Jensen**也提到过。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rajie**: Yeah, I think one of the most exciting things for engineering leaders including myself is we can write more code now. Like I love writing code. I over the holidays bought a laptop and because sometimes you can't install things because of it but like I bought my own personal laptop at the **Apple Store** installed cloud code and you know built an app bunch of **Python** scripts and things like that. And and you know for someone who has grown up writing code for my bar for my own code is super high like as it is for all my engineers and so like for me to take a time out to go and build a whole new feature it it's it's a lot of time in the old traditional way but now I can do it much faster with **RoboDev** with with agents and things like that and it's always satisfying to go join a **hackathon** build something and write code and so for all the leaders I think it's like you know you can get a lot more connected because sometimes as a leader you go up the chain and then you get more disconnected from code and engineers and now I think that is that gap is shrinking. The other thing that's interesting that's happening is the span of control is changing. I've always advocated for you know the the degenerate case of where you have a team of 400 engineers. You take the square root of 400 and you have essentially 20 direct reports each having 20 direct reports and then it's just two layers of management. But usually most most organizations have people who have like five or three reports that most degenerate cases the binary tree right two reports two reports two reports all the way down. But I think the span of controls will increase. I think Tibo I think talked about having 33 direct reports. You know Jensen talks about...

</details>

**Gerge**: 33个。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gerge**: 33. Yeah.

</details>

**Rajie**: 是的，是的。有40或50个。是的，我认为人们会有更多的直接下属，更少的经理，经理会与代码联系更紧密。我认为所有这些都是好事。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rajie**: Yeah. Yeah. Having like 40 or 50. Yeah. I think like people will have more direct reports and fewer managers and managers will be more connected with the quotes. I think all of this is really a good thing.

</details>

**Gerge**: 作为一个后续问题，传统的职业路径会怎样？天哪，我说的传统是指2020年、2022年之前，因为我们习惯了有这样的职业路径：软件工程师、高级工程师，然后是**资深工程师**（staff engineer）、**工程经理**、**高级工程经理**、**总监**、**高级总监**等等。你认为会发生什么？只是一个有根据的猜测。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gerge**: As a followup, what about the traditional career path? Traditional oh my gosh I'm talking like you know like pre like 2020 2022 because we were used to there was a career path like be a you know software engineer senior engineer then either staff engineer engine manager senior engine manager director senior director etc. What do you think might happen just in taking educated guess?

</details>

**Rajie**: 嗯，首先，每当有人问我作为工程师的职业路径时，我告诉人们的第一件事就是：不要成为经理。事实上，我刚开始工作时也是这样，有人给了我这个建议。所以在我职业生涯的最初许多年里，我尽可能避免成为经理，直到我发现有些决策我无法理解。然后我才探出头来，看看到底发生了什么，然后加入了“黑暗面”。但对于工程师来说，现在是一个非常好的时代。我会继续编写代码，使用智能体，解决问题，做所有先进的、前沿的事情。我们不知道未来会走向何方，但如果你是一名编写代码的工程师，你会没事的。经理和领导者会稍微困难一些。我认为他们的人数可能会减少。如果你想亲自动手，那会很令人兴奋，这很棒。我认为领导和管理之类的东西会减少，更多的是在这个新世界中动手实践和解决问题。我认为那些这样做的人会做得很好。那些想坚持旧职业路径的人可能需要寻找其他出路。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rajie**: Well, first of all, you know, anytime somebody asks me about career path as an engineer, but the first thing I tell people is don't be a manager. Okay. In fact, I did that myself when I started out. Somebody gave me that advice. And so the for the first many years of my career, I avoided being a manager as far as I could until I found decisions being made that I didn't understand. And so then I popped my head up to see okay what the hell is happening and that sort of thing and then joined the dark side. But like, you know...

</details>

**Gerge**: 结局还不错。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gerge**: Worked out pretty good in the end.

</details>

**Rajie**: 是的，是的。但我想说，对于工程师来说，现在是一个非常好的时代。我会继续编写代码，使用智能体，解决问题，做所有先进的、前沿的事情。我们不知道未来会走向何方，但如果你是一名编写代码的工程师，你会没事的。经理和领导者会稍微困难一些。我认为他们的人数可能会减少。如果你想亲自动手，那会很令人兴奋，这很棒。我认为领导和管理之类的东西会减少，更多的是在这个新世界中动手实践和解决问题。我认为那些这样做的人会做得很好。那些想坚持旧职业路径的人可能需要寻找其他出路。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rajie**: Yeah. Yeah. But I'd say like you know for for engineers like I mean it's it's it's a great time to be alive. Like I would just write code, use agents, figure this out, do all the advanced, you know, cutting edge stuff for a while. I mean we don't know where the future is going but like you'll be fine if you're an engineer writing code. Managers and leaders, it's a little tougher. I think there might be fewer of them. I think it's exciting if you are want to be hands-on that it's amazing. I think there's less of like leadership management blah blah blah. It's more of like doing and like figuring things out in this new world. And those who do I think will do well. Those who want to like stick to the old career paths might have to find something else.

</details>

**Thomas**: 我有三点。第一点，对于所有初创公司创始人：每当投资者问你如何阻止现有公司做你正在做的事情时，你只需告诉他们，**Atlassian**的**CTO**不得不自掏腰包买一台笔记本电脑来开始编码。这是我能给出的最好答案，因为它表明即使是相对敏捷、实际开发敏捷工具的公司，也无法真正做到你能在5分钟内完成的事情。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Thomas**: I have three things. One, number one, for all the startup founders. Every time an investor asks you how they're preventing the incumbent doing the same thing that you're doing, just tell them that the **CTO** of **Atlassian** had to buy a laptop on his own money to start coding. That's the best answer I can give because it shows you how even, you know, relatively agile companies that actually develop agile tools, you know, can't really do what you can do in 5 minutes.

</details>

**Rajie**: 我会解决的，**Thomas**，等我收购你的公司后我会解决的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rajie**: I'll fix it. I'll fix it once I acquire your company, Thomas.

</details>

**Thomas**: 哦，你可以得到他们的资产，你可以得到他们的资产并用它们来编码。第二点是，我认为在过去两年中，通过**C-pilot**、**Kursa**和**Devon**等**编码智能体**，许多**CTO**和**CIO**，即使是这个国家和许多其他国家最大的银行，也意识到他们可以重新开始编码，因为它不再需要花费数小时来安装所有软件包并解决所有问题。所以，我有一些这方面的朋友，他们告诉我这样的故事：他们每天晚上都会给**Devon**一个任务，说**Devon**帮我构建这个，然后早上会和智能体开发者核对，然后继续下去。然后他们像一个大银行的**CTO**一样过着正常的日常工作。你这样做两周，就会意识到一切都将改变，并且必须在我的组织中改变。与**Twilio**创始人“问你的开发者”那种由下而上决定工具的方式不同，这些人进入他们的组织说：“我不想听到任何借口。我们要推出智能体。”许多银行仍然使用非常老旧的系统，他们的开发者使用**Citrix**之类的工具。通常**CTO**没有权力推翻这些，因为**CISO**的担忧等等。我认为这种情况已经发生了巨大的变化，因为他们再次亲自动手，意识到这项技术有多么强大。这种转变正在发生。你到处都能看到这一点，没有其他软件开发技术像智能体一样被如此迅速地采用。大多数德国公司、日本公司和其他国际公司仍然没有上云，因为他们听到了来自法务团队、安全团队等等的各种担忧。然后是第三点，当你问到领导力和经理时，我第一次真正成为经理是在我的初创公司被**Microsoft**收购时，因为一个10人初创公司的**CEO**实际上并不是经理，你只是10个人中的一个，你是发言人，你必须处理工资，并向客户推销。我成为经理后意识到，天哪，现在我必须招聘人员，这意味着我必须写**职位描述**和进行面试，我必须写**绩效评估**。当**ChatGPT**问世时，我们突然就让**ChatGPT**为我们写绩效评估。当然，员工也在他们的网站上做了同样的事情。如果你在**Microsoft**工作过，每个员工都必须填写大约七个输入字段，然后经理必须对这七个输入字段做出回应。如果你是一个懒惰的开发者经理，你就会写“我同意你的看法”，员工对此并不满意。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Thomas**: Um, I I'll fix it. I'll fix it once I acquire your company, Thomas. Oh, you can you can get their assets. You can get their assets and use them for coding. Number two is I think what happened in the last two years through coding agents like **C-pilot**, **Kursa** and **Devon** is that many **CTOs** and **CIOs** even in the largest banks in this country and many other countries have realized they can go back to coding because it no longer takes hours to install all the packages and figure out all the problems. And so I actually I have friends in that in that space that told me stories of like on every night they would give **Devon** a task and and say **Devon** built me this and then on the morning would check the check in with the developer at the agent and then keep going that way and then they have their normal day-to-day as a as a **CTO** of a big bank and you do that for two weeks and you realize everything is going to change and has to change in my organization and in contrast to the **Twilio** founders ask your developer where the developer decides bottoms up what the tools are. Those folks went into the into their organization says I don't want to hear any excuses. We're going to roll out agents and you know many banks still are on very archive systems and they have developers like to **Citrix** and and what have you and often the **CTO** was not empowered to override this because of **CISO** concerns and and what have you. And I think that has dramatically changed because basic gets our hands dirty again and realize how powerful this technology is. And that shift is happening. You see this everywhere like no other software development technology has been adopted as fast as agents right like most German companies you know Japanese companies other international are still not in the cloud because of all the kinds of concerns that they heard from the legal team security teams and whatnot and then there's the third piece you know when you ask about leadership and manager you know when I became a manager the first time I became really manager was when I my startup got acquired by **Microsoft** because **CEO** of a 10 person startup you're not actually a manager you're just one of 10 and you're the speaker and it has to do payroll and and and pitch to customers and I became a manager and I realized, oh god, now I have to hire people, which means I have to write a **job description** and do interviews and I have to write **performance reviews**. You know, when **CHPT** came out, all of a sudden we just would ask **Chet PT** to write the performance review for us and of course the employees did the same on their site and if you have worked at **Microsoft** every like the employee has to fill out like I think seven input fields on their side and then the manager has to react to those seven input fields. And if you're a lazy developer manager, you write I agree with you and the employee is not happy about that.

</details>

**Gerge**: 等一下。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gerge**: Hang on.

</details>

**Thomas**: 所以你通过问**ChatGPT**来破解这个系统，然后反过来，它会给我你输入到**ChatGPT**的要点，这样我至少知道你是如何进行**提示**的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Thomas**: And so you kind of hack that system by just asking Chatty which then in reverse is then give me just the bullets that you put into Chat GBT. So at least I know how you're prompting.

</details>

**Gerge**: 所以你带着这种心态成为了**GitHub**的**CEO**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gerge**: So you became the **CEO** of **GitHub** with this mentality.

</details>

**Thomas**: 你知道**GitHub**的核心理念是“**开发者优先**”。开发者优先是我们一直在**GitHub**所说的，对于我们设计的每一个东西，每一个流程，每一个营销活动。当我们失败时，你可以在**Hacker News**上看到，非常直接。当**GitHub**的博客文章、推文或消息过于“企业化”时，开发者就不会喜欢，他们不想要那种东西。给我真相，给我直接的对话，不要给我所有的营销废话。这适用于其他产品，但不适用于开发者工具。我认为对于作为团队的人事经理、工程经理来说也是如此。你的团队清楚地知道你是否在直接地告诉他们真相，或者你是否在粉饰他们做得不好的事实，并试图传达他们要么改进要么走人的信息。我认为这就是AI改变这一切的地方，因为我花一个小时写一份粉饰过的绩效总结，当然，工程师会反向输入到**ChatGPT**中，然后问：“**Thomas**到底是什么意思？他是不是用AI写的？”等等。我认为这是一件好事。当我们考虑AI驱动的销售流程时，我可不想要一封来自销售智能体的AI邮件来向我推销外包公司之类的东西。我只想要一个AI来删除所有这些，并告诉他们永远不要再联系我。我认为对于**人员管理**也是如此。当你与团队成员、你的**IC**（独立贡献者）建立在诚实、信任基础上的关系时，会更加愉快，就像你希望与家里的配偶和孩子建立的关系一样。我认为这将发生转变，因为你不能再作为一个人事经理，通过欺骗的方式成为最友善的经理，而实际上你正在团队中挣扎于所有问题。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Thomas**: You know that God does **GitHub**. You know the the the key pragma if you will or dogma. By the way, we are joking in the green room. I think the next one is the dogmatic summit and so we have all the dogmas on stage is much more entertaining I think. Is **developers first** right **developers first** is what what we always said at **GitHub** for everything we design for every process for the marketing and when we fail you can see that a **Hacker News** is very very straight right like when a **GitHub** blog post or **GitHub** tweet or a message is too corporate, quote unquote. Developers won't like that and they don't want to have that. Give me the truth, give me the direct conversation, don't give me all the marketing bull. That works for other products, but it doesn't work for developer tools, right? And I think the same is true for being a people manager, an engineering manager of a team, like your team knows exactly whether you're talking straight to them and giving them the truth or whether you're sugar coating that they're actually not doing so well and you're kind of like trying to tell give them the message that you either improve or or you get the out, right? And and and I think this is where you know the AI is changing this because this I'm spending an hour of writing a a pified you know summary of a performance of course the engineer just feeds that into chatbt backwards and says what did Thomas actually mean and did he use AI to write this and all of that and I think this is this is a good thing like you know when we when we think about um AIdriven sales processes hell I don't want an AI email from a sales agent to sell me some outsource ing company or something like that. Just I want an AI that deletes all that and tells them to never contact me again, right? And I think the same is true like for people management. It's so much more it's so much more enjoyable when you have a relationship with your pe with your with your team members, your **IC's** that's on on an honest trustworthy basis like you hopefully have you know with your spouse at home and and your kids and whatnot. And I think that is going to shift because you can no longer cheat your way as a people manager into being the nicest manager of everybody while in reality you you're having you're struggling with all the problems in your team.

</details>

**Gerge**: 你听到了，来自**GitHub**前**CEO**的话，管理实际上可能会变得更愉快。谢谢。现在看看你目前的团队，工作方式上已经发生了最大的变化是什么？你期望明年会发生什么？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gerge**: I mean you heard it from the former the last **CEO** of **GitHub** you know management might actually become like a bit more enjoyable. Thanks for that. Looking at your current teams now, what is the biggest change that's already happened in in how you're working and what do you expect to happen this coming year?

</details>

### AI对团队生产力的影响与未来展望

**Rajie**: 是的，我的意思是，显然最大的变化是**智能体编码**（agentic coding）和使用智能体来完成工作。在**Atlassian**，我们所有的工程师都在使用**RoboDev**。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rajie**: Yeah, I I mean like clearly the biggest change is agentic coding and using agents to do stuff like in **Atlassian** **RoboDev** is used by all our engineers.

</details>

**Gerge**: 所有的工程师？

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gerge**: All the engineers.

</details>

**Rajie**: 是的，是的。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rajie**: Yes. Yes.

</details>

**Gerge**: 太棒了。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Gerge**: Nice.

</details>

**Rajie**: 是的。**代码审查**。我的意思是，我每天都看到通过代码审查的**差异**（diffs）百分比在相当大地增加。每个工程师的**PR**（拉取请求）增加了89%。问题周期时间下降了42%。51%的**安全漏洞**现在通过智能体解决了。所以我们看到我们的生产力输出指标，**DORA指标**（Dora metrics）等等，都在大幅提升，这意味着情况很好，这都归功于智能体编码和类似的东西。除了这些指标，我想说我们对产品经理、设计和工程之间的协作方式感到非常兴奋，因为我们构建了许多产品，比如**Jira**和**Confluence**，所以这个循环对我们来说非常重要。我们发现，由于产品经理使用**Replit**等工具，他们实际上正在生成更好的规范，这些规范更适合我们想要的产品，也更容易让工程师去实现。所以肯定看到了很多变化。我认为未来会发生的是，**零代码**手动编码来构建产品的概念，因为现在是手动编码和智能体混合使用。我认为我们将达到完全信任智能体完成的代码审查，而不需要太多人工审查的程度。我认为我们将转向更多地验证输入和输出，以查看系统是否按照正确的安全、可靠性、性能标准运行，而不是过多地检查代码。然后，如果我展望未来，我知道**TB**不想展望两年，但如果我展望两年或更长时间，也许我们不再需要编程语言和**IDE**了，我们会有某种AI **JVM**或类似的东西来完成所有事情。因为如果你想想，编程语言之所以存在，是因为我们不想写**汇编语言**，我们需要一些东西来告诉计算机做什么。但如果AI能够做到这一点，并且你也可以使用AI进行调试，那么它就会转向更高层次的意图，你可能就不再需要编程了。这当然非常极端，我不知道它是否会发生，但这是可以想象的，所以思考那样的世界会是什么样子，真的令人兴奋。

<details>
<summary>Original English</summary>

**Rajie**: Yes. Code reviews. I mean every day I see the percentage of diffs that are through code reviews are increasing quite a bit. PRs per engineer have gone up 89%. Issue cycle time has got has gone down 42%. 51% of security vulnerabilities are now cut through agents. So we're seeing like massive change in in our productivity output metrics the **Dora metrics** all of that is going up you know going well up meaning well because of agent encoding and that sort of thing. And more than the metrics I'd say like we are we are really excited about how we are working across PM design and engineering because we build a lot of products like **Jira** **Confluence** and so that that loop is very important for us and we are finding that because PMs are using like **Replit** and things like that they're producing actually better specs that are much more amenable to being close to the product that we want easier for engineers to go implement and so definitely seeing a lot of change. What will happen in the future I think is this notion of building products with actually zero lines of code manual coding I would say because today it's a mix of like some manual coding some agents. I think we will get to the point where we just trust the code reviews done by the agents and not have to have too much human review over that. I think we move towards more verification of inputs and outputs to see the system performing according to the right security reliability performance bars less about inspection of code and And then if I were to look out I know that TB didn't want to look out two years but if I look out two years plus maybe we don't have programming languages and **IDEs** anymore and we have some kind of AI **JVM** or something that just sort of does things and because like if you think about it programming languages are there because like you know we don't want to write assembly and we need something to tell the computer what to do but like if AI is able to do that and you know you're able to debug using AI as well then it shifts to a higher level intent and you don't need maybe programming. Now that's super extreme. I don't know if it'll go there, but it is conceivable and so that's really exciting to think about what that word would look like.

**Thomas**: 从**CEO**的角度来看，我认为有两个巨大的变化。一是**成本**飙升。每个管理大型团队的人都有一些固定的**运营支出预算**（opex budget），主要包括工资、福利以及一些差旅和费用。突然之间，我们有了灵活的**代币成本**。你的开发者生产力越高（你刚才提到所有这些令人印象深刻的统计数据），你的成本就越高，这实际上会造成一种倒置，你不得不放慢一些开发者的速度，因为他们消耗了太多代币，然后他们就会说：“那我就少做一些功能，对吧？”这对于初创公司创始人来说，只有在资金耗尽、**烧钱速度**（run rate）缩短时才会遇到。但对于大公司的大型经理来说，他们实际上必须和他们的财务团队一起解决这个问题。传统的处理方法将不再奏效。你实际上希望鼓励团队消耗更多的代币。你今天早上在很早的会议上谈到了**OpenAI**的数十亿代币，他们不必为此付费。显然，那不是真的。他们正在为**Azure**、**Oracle**等等的**GPU**付费。但我认为这对我们管理团队的方式来说是一个巨大的变化。突然之间，你有了，而且没有人想做的是裁员来抵消代币的成本，对吧？因为这样做的人力成本远高于收益。我认为非常积极的一面是，**编码再次变得有趣了**。我是在1990年代早期用**Commodore 64**学习编码的，然后我有了386DX40，带涡轮开关，还有**奔腾**等等。我记得那些日子，我无法解决任何问题，因为我只有书，计算机俱乐部只有周三开放，你就卡住了，对吧？你沮丧地睡觉，然后早上希望能有一些直觉来解决那个问题。然后互联网来了，论坛来了，突然你可以和人们交流了。现在你只需3秒钟，就可以让智能体解决问题。我认为我们低估了这些智能体的力量，因为我们都只考虑**代码生成**。我认为最好的情况实际上是终端上出现一些愚蠢的构建错误或**npm**错误，然后你只需将其输入到**Codex**中，说：“嘿，去解决这个问题。我不想处理这些。”对吧？我认为这比以前有趣多了。单元测试也是一样。喜欢编写**单元测试**的请举手。对吧？哦，就那一个。

**Thomas**: From the **CEO** perspective, I think there's two drastic changes. One is costs are through the roof. And as everybody who manages a larger team has some fixed **opex budget** that is mostly your salaries, your benefits and then some travel and expenses, right? All of a sudden, we have flexible **token costs**. And the more productive you you had all this impressive statistics, the more productive your developers are, the more your costs are going through the roof and you actually create an inversion where you have to slow down some developers because they're burning so many tokens and then they're like, "Well, then I will build less features, right?" And that's something that a startup founder only deals with when when the money runs out, the **run rate** gets shorter. But a a big manager in a in a corporation will actually have to figure out with their with their finance team, right? What the traditional approach to this will no longer work. And you actually want to encourage teams to burn more tokens. And you talked in a very early session this morning about **OpenAI's** billions tokens and they don't have to pay for them. Obviously, that's not true. They're paying for the **GPUs** to to **Azure** and **Oracle** and and whatnot. But that's I think a drastic change to how we're managing teams. That all of a sudden you had and look what nobody wants to do is fire people to offset the cost of the tokens, right? Because the the human cost of that is is way higher than the benefits. I think the very positive version of that is **coding is fun again**. And I, you know, I learned coding on a **Commodore 64** in the early 1990s and then I had a 3860x40 with a turbo switch and a pensium and whatnot. And I remember the days when I couldn't solve any of my problems because all I had was books and computer club was only Wednesdays and you were just stuck, right? And you went to bed frustrated and and and then in the morning hopefully you had some, you know, intuition of how to solve that problem. Came the internet, came forums, all of a sudden you could talk to people. Now you can just in 3 seconds, you know, ask the agents to figure it out. And I think, you know, we're underestimating the power of these agents because we all think about **code generation**. I think the best scenario is actually have some stupid build error or **npm** error or something on the terminal and just feed that into **Codex** and say, "Hey, go and solve this. I don't want to deal with any of that." Right? I think that's it's way more fun than it ever was. Same for **unit testing**. Raise your hand if you love wring **unit tests**. Right? Like, oh, that's the one. Um uh...

**Thomas**: 不，那是规则的例外，对吧？但是，能够说“给我写**单元测试**”或者“修复测试”等等，这太强大了。编码再次变得有趣，它把我们带回了我们学习编码的时候。我认为智能体所做的是，它把我们带回了编码的乐趣。我大约一个月前在**OpenAI**，他们向一些开发者展示了新的**Codex Mac应用**。他们确保我们都签署了**NDA**，但现在这个应用已经发布了，所以我可以谈论它。当时有一些食物和演示，然后我们都有一些编码时间，我用**Swift UI**构建了三个原生的**Mac应用**，完全没有看代码。这真是太棒了。我有一个菜单栏应用，昨天有人在**X**上说：“我喜欢在**Mac**上构建菜单栏应用！”这太容易了。如果你自己尝试过，在**GitHub**、**Google**、**Stack Overflow**上搜索，甚至只是设置**Xcode**项目来隐藏**Dock**图标，只在菜单栏显示，你可能在第一个构建运行起来之前就已经放弃了，想法也已经飞走了。我认为这真是太不可思议了。无论这是否适用于我们所有的爱好项目，但最终都让我们进入了这个行业，希望如此。无论是在**Atlassian**、**ENTIA**还是**GitHub**工作。我认为这就是最神奇的地方，这才是真正的巨大变化。生产力很高，这对**CFO**、**CEO**和股市来说都很棒，但对我们真正重要的是，我们的工作再次变得有趣了。

**Thomas**: No, the the exception to the rule, right? But like that that's so powerful to just say write write me **unit tests** and and or or fix the tests and and and what have you. Coding is fun again and it brings us back to when we learned coding. I think what agents have done is it bring us back to the joy of coding and I was at **OpenAI** a month ago or so and they showed a couple of builders the new **Codex Mac app** and made sure we're all in the **NDA** but now the app is out so I can talk about it and was a bit you know food and and presentation and then we all had some coding time and I built three native **Mac apps** like in **Swift UI** without ever looking at the code right and and that's just and I had a menu by app and somebody was yesterday on **X** saying I love building menu by apps on on Mac, right? And it's so easy. And if you ever tried that yourself in in going on, you know, **GitHub**, **Google**, **Stack Overflow**, whatever, have it even setting up just the **Xcode** project to hide the doc icon and have it only in the menu bar, you you have given up and and the idea has, you know, flown away by the time you actually had the first build running. And I think that's just so incredible. And whether that applies to all our hobby projects, but ultimately got us into this profession, hopefully. Whether or it's you know doing work at **Atlassian** or at **ENTIA** or **GitHub**. I think that's what what is so amazing about this and that is the actual drastic and the productivity is great you know for the **CFO** and the **CEO** and the and and and then the the stock public stock markets but what really matters to us is our job is fun again.
