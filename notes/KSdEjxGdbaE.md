### 从对冲基金到可汗学院的诞生

大家好，欢迎收听“In Good Company”节目，今天我们非常高兴能带来一期特别节目，邀请到**可汗学院**（Khan Academy: 一个提供免费、世界级教育的非营利组织）富有远见的创始人萨尔·汗（Sal Khan）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">hi everyone and welcome to in good company and today we are thrilled to have a bonus episode with Salan the Visionary founder of Khan Academy.</p>
</details>

我们很多人，包括我自己的孩子，都非常感谢可汗学院在家庭作业和学习上提供的帮助，所以很高兴能邀请到您。您确实彻底改变了教育。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now we are a lot of people who have to thank KH for all his help with our homework and learning including uh on behalf of my own children so it's a pleasure to have you here you have really revolutionized education.</p>
</details>

感谢邀请。萨利，能和一位同样有**对冲基金**（Hedge Fund: 一种采用多种投资策略来对冲市场风险、以期获得绝对收益的投资基金）背景的人一起做播客，这很有趣，因为您是第一个。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">thanks for having me and and also Sally it's kind of fun to have uh somebody else on the bcast who has a a background in in a hedge fund because uh you're the first one actually oh yeah.</p>
</details>

哦，是吗？我们都是对冲基金的“难民”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">okay we're hedge fund refugees.</p>
</details>

当然。您从对冲基金转行创办可汗学院的故事非常动人。您能简单回顾一下，这一切是如何开始的吗？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">absolutely I just think it's such a lovely story the way you went from you know a hedge fund to starting Can Academy would you mind just recapping in a in a few words how you got started on this.</p>
</details>

好的，时间回到2004年。我从商学院毕业一年，我的最初背景是技术，但后来我去了商学院，最终在波士顿一家非常小的对冲基金工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah you you go back to 2004 I was a year out of business school my original background was in tech but I go to business school I end up at a very small hedge fund in Boston a year out of business school.</p>
</details>

我当时在新泽西结婚，我出生在新奥尔良并长大。我的家人来新泽西参加我的婚礼，然后又来波士顿和我待了一段时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I I'm get I Get Married in New Jersey I was born and raised in New Orleans my family comes for my wedding in New Jersey and then comes and spends time with me in Boston.</p>
</details>

在一次聊天中，我的12岁表妹娜迪亚（Nadia）——当时和我们住在一起——数学遇到了困难。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and just comes out of conversation that my 12-year-old cousin Nadia who was staying with us uh was having trouble in math.</p>
</details>

我提出在她回到新奥尔良后给她辅导，她同意了，辅导效果很好，长话短说。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I offered to tutor her when she went back to New Orleans she agreed and the tutoring worked to a long story short.</p>
</details>

那个在七年级还在单位换算上挣扎的娜迪亚，到了那个夏天，就已经在新奥尔良大学上微积分课了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and uh that same naadia who was struggling with unit conversion in seventh grade uh by that summer was taking calculus classes at the University of New Orleans.</p>
</details>

于是我开始辅导她年幼的弟弟们，免费辅导的消息在我家人中传开了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">uh so I started tutoring her younger brothers word spreads in my family- free tutoring is going on.</p>
</details>

不知不觉中，我每天下班后都在辅导10到15个表亲和家庭朋友。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">before I know it I'm tutoring 10 15 cousins family friends uh after work every day.</p>
</details>

显然这只是一个爱好，但我发现了一个普遍的模式：他们之所以挣扎，是因为知识存在空白，他们需要复习和巩固。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">obviously this was just a hobby and I saw a common pattern that they were struggling because they had gaps in their knowledge they needed to review things they need to refresh things.</p>
</details>

所以在2005年，我开始为他们编写软件，这仍然是一个家庭爱好，但我称之为“可汗学院”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so in 2005 I started writing software for them once again it's a family hobby but I called it KH Academy.</p>
</details>

那个软件会给他们提供练习题，并帮助我作为他们的导师来跟踪进度，当时还没有视频。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and that software would give them practice problems and for me as their tutor to keep track of it it didn't have videos at the time.</p>
</details>

然后在2006年，一位朋友建议我制作YouTube视频，以便为我的表亲们扩展我的课程，因为我发现很难与10到15个表亲安排时间，而且我感觉自己一直在重复同样的内容。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">then in 2006 a friend suggested Ed that I make YouTube videos from my cousins to help scale my lessons cuz I actually was having trouble scheduling with 10 15 cousins and I felt like I was repeating the same thing over and over again.</p>
</details>

于是我开始制作这些视频，我的表亲们就直言不讳地告诉我，他们更喜欢在YouTube上看我，而不是面对面。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so I started making those videos and my cousins famously told me that they like me better on YouTube than in person.</p>
</details>

我想他们想表达的是，他们喜欢这种按需学习的版本，如果需要复习几年前的内容，也不会感到羞耻；他们可以在深夜学习时观看视频。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and what they were saying I think is uh they liked having an ond demand version there was no shame if they had to review something from a few years earlier they could watch it in the middle of the night if that's when they were working on the problems.</p>
</details>

他们仍然很感谢我能关心他们等等。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">they still appreciated having me check in on them Etc.</p>
</details>

到2008年到2009年，大约有5万到10万人使用这些视频和软件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and by 2008 2009 there were about 50 to 100,000 folks using the videos and the software.</p>
</details>

我甚至不得不关闭软件的访问权限，因为它超出了我的网络托管能力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I actually had to turn off the access to the software because it was overwhelming my web hosting uh.</p>
</details>

正是在2008年，我将其设立为一个非营利组织。当时我并没有想过要辞掉对冲基金的工作，我其实很喜欢那份工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and that's when I in 2008 I set it up as a nonprofit at the time I didn't think I was going to quit my hedge fund job I actually liked my hedge fund job uh.</p>
</details>

但我将其设立为一个非营利组织，使命是为任何人、任何地方提供免费的世界级教育。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but I set it up as a nonprofit with a mission free worldclass education for anyone anywhere.</p>
</details>

到了2009年，我发现自己很难专注于对冲基金的工作，因为我收到了来自世界各地的信件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then by 2009 I had trouble focusing on my hedge fund job because it was I was getting letters from all over the world.</p>
</details>

我只是等着回家制作下一个视频或编写下一个软件模块。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was just waiting to get home to work on the next video or to write the next software module.</p>
</details>

于是我辞掉了日常工作。我和妻子查看了我们的财务状况，然后说：“好吧，也许我可以这样干一年，靠积蓄生活一段时间。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so that's when I quit my day job my wife and I looked at our finances and we said okay maybe I could do this for a year live off of savings a bit um.</p>
</details>

第一年很艰难。每当你尝试开始任何事情时，你可能会抱有一种妄想般的乐观，认为人们会来支持它，但这需要一些时间。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and that first year was tough whenever you try to start anything it's you you have a maybe delusionally optimistic view of maybe people will come and support it but it took a little while.</p>
</details>

但到了2010年秋天，我们获得了第一笔重要的慈善支持。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but by uh fall of 2010 we got our first significant uh philanthropic support.</p>
</details>

主持人问，现在可汗学院帮助了多少人？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">amazing and fast forward to now how many people do you do you help.</p>
</details>

萨尔·汗回答说，这取决于你如何计算。我们的注册用户现在是1.6亿或1.7亿。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">oh well you know it depends how you account for it uh I think our registered users is 160 or 170 million registered users now.</p>
</details>

如果你按课程观看次数计算，那是在数十亿次；如果你按每年的学习分钟数计算，那也是在数十亿次，我想大概是100亿分钟。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I think if you counted it by You Know lesson views it's in the billions uh if you count it by learning minutes per year that's also in the on I think it's on the order of 10 10 billion.</p>
</details>

主持人又问，在最初进展缓慢的时候，是什么让您保持动力？因为像英伟达（Nvidia）和声田（Spotify）这样的成功公司也曾几次濒临破产。是什么让您坚持下来的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but in the beginning um when you when it was um slower what kept you motivating motivated because I think it's interesting you know successful companies such as Nvidia uh you know nearly went under a few times spottify and nearly went under a few times what kept you motivated through all this.</p>
</details>

萨尔·汗表示，仅仅是能够与家人保持联系，看到他们在数学上取得进步，或者在科学或其他任何方面获得自信，这对我来说就非常值得。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">just me being able to connect with my family and them being able to accelerate in math or make sure that they have confidence in science or whatever they're doing that was worth it for me very much worth it.</p>
</details>

一旦它开始传播开来，我的表亲以外的人也开始使用它，并给我发来感谢信，这些信件就像我早上的“提神剂”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and um but once it started to getting out there and people who are not my cous cousin started using it and they started sending me notes that note was like my pickme up of the morning.</p>
</details>

现在仍然如此，我们可汗学院仍然收到信件。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">it still is we still get letters at Khan Academy.</p>
</details>

虽然我热爱我的工作，但总有好日子和坏日子。每当我读到那些来自世界各地人们的信件时，就会充满动力。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and the thing that you know every I love my job but there's good days bad days and and but whenever I read those letters from people all over the world saying how you know.</p>
</details>

有些只是简单的感谢，比如“你帮我通过了这次考试”，但有些则非常感人，他们讲述了自己如何在某个科目上缺乏自信，人们一辈子都认为他们很笨，然后他们转行或加入了某个团体，后来发现了可汗学院。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">some of them are just simple thank yous like hey you helped me pass this exam or that exam but some of them are pretty emotional where they're talking about how they had no self-esteem in some topic they you know people thought they were were dumb their whole life then they went some other career track or they joined this or that and then they found KH Academy.</p>
</details>

他们开始按照自己的时间和节奏学习，发现了对这门学科的热爱，然后重返大学，或者现在正在攻读某个领域的博士学位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then they started working at their own time in Pace they discovered a a love for the subject and then they go back to college or now they're getting a PhD in something um.</p>
</details>

当你收到来自世界各地陌生人的这类信件时，那真是令人难以置信的鼓舞。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">when you get letters like that from people you don't know all over the world it's incredibly motivating.</p>
</details>

所以，最艰难的时期可能就是2009年秋到2010年秋那一年，我辞掉了日常工作，我们动用了积蓄，我的妻子还在医生培训中，我们的第一个孩子也出生了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so that you know the hardest point was probably that year from Fall of 2009 to fall of 2010 where I had quit my day job we're digging into our savings my wife was still in training to be a doctor um our first child had been born.</p>
</details>

你可以想象，我放弃了一份收入非常丰厚的好工作。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you could imagine I had given up a very good job that was paying very well um.</p>
</details>

那段时期，也就是三四个月后，压力非常大。每当我想要更新简历，申请另一份金融工作时，我都会看看这些信件，心想：“不，这里面有重要的东西。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">that was you know three or four months into that it was very stressful and whenever I was tempted to you know re refresh my resume and apply for another Finance job I would look at these letters I was like no this it's something here.</p>
</details>

我确实告诉自己，如果未来一年内没有获得任何真正的慈善资助，我不会放弃这个项目，我会回去工作以养活自己和家人，但我会继续把它当作爱好来做。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I I did tell myself if if I didn't get any real philanthropic funding in the next year I wouldn't give up the project I would go back to work so I could support myself and my family but I would keep working on it as a hobby um.</p>
</details>

也许只是时机不对。所以，我确实想让它变得“不可被扼杀”，因为我内心深处觉得，这里面蕴藏着一些重要的东西。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and maybe the the timing just wasn't right so I I did want to make it unkillable because I I I I felt in my heart of hearts that there was there was something there.</p>
</details>

主持人问，当您在对冲基金赚大钱和创办这个慈善事业、真正帮助世界之间做选择时，您当时在想什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">what when through your head when you were thinking okay I'm either going to work in a hedge fund make a lot of money or I'm going to start this philanthropic Venture and you know really help the world what what went through your head.</p>
</details>

萨尔·汗回忆说，这很有趣。当我从商学院毕业时，正如我所说，我有点迷茫，不知道自己一生要做什么。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you know it's interesting when I um came out of B you know as as I mentioned I business school was a little bit of like what am I going to do with my lifetime and while there uh I I had never no I had no experience in finance before that um.</p>
</details>

在此之前，我没有任何金融经验。在商学院期间，我上了一门资本市场课程，这门课数学含量很高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and once I was there I I took a class in Capital markets which was pretty math heavy uh.</p>
</details>

但我被它吸引了，因为它既有数学成分，也有非常历史的、人类心理学的成分。你真的需要了解世界是如何运作的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but I was fascinated because it had a math aspect to it but it also had a very historical uh human psychological aspects to it you really have to understand how the world works.</p>
</details>

我记得当时问教授：“嘿，我喜欢这门课，我该做什么？”他说：“哦，你应该去对冲基金工作。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I remember asking the professor there hey I love this class what should I do and he's like oh you should work at a hedge fund.</p>
</details>

我说：“听起来不错，什么是对冲基金？”他解释说，它像一家投资公司，但它们比共同基金有更大的灵活性，可以做更多有创意的事情。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I said well that sounds great what's a hedge fund and you know we explain it's it's like a it's an investment firm but they have more flexibility and they can do more creative things than say a mutual fund um.</p>
</details>

所以我被这个职业吸引了，因为它似乎能带来智力上的探索。我当时很天真，开始问一些金融界的朋友：“嘿，对冲基金的薪水高吗？”他们说：“是的。”我又问：“大概多少？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so I I was drawn to that career because of the intellectual Journey that it seemed to have and I was so naive I started asking some friends in finance I said hey do hedge funds pay well and they said yeah I said about how much and um.</p>
</details>

当我得知薪资水平后，考虑到我大学时期的债务，以及商学院大约12万美元的债务，我说：“你知道，我不是在富裕家庭长大的。我的家庭，我是在单亲母亲的家庭中长大的，充其量只能算是中下阶层。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">once I learned that and I had I still had some debt from undergrad and then I had about $120,000 of debt from business school I said you know I did not grow up I I think you know my family I grew up in a single mother household at best I would call us a lower middle class at best.</p>
</details>

我想：“好吧，我需要还清这些债务，存些钱，然后最终为买房付首付，也许还要帮助家人等等。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</p>
<p class="english-text">I was like okay I need to pay off this debt save some money and you know get a down payment on a house eventually help maybe help support family Etc.</p>
</details>

而且这份工作在智力上也很刺激，这就是我选择对冲基金这条路的原因。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and it was intellectually stimulating so that's what drove me down the hedge fund path.</p>
</details>

但当时我的妻子，我的未婚妻，总是为此抱怨我，她说：“像你这样的人，你受过这样的教育，拥有所有这些技能，却只是用它们来做投资。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but my my wife at that time my fiance always used to give me a little bit of grief about it she's like you know people like you you're you you have this education you have all of these skills and you're just using it to make in to make investments.</p>
</details>

我说：“嗯，你知道，世界需要对冲基金，它有助于价格发现和流动性等等。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I was like well you know the head world needs hedge funds it helps price Discovery and liquidity and all this kind.</p>
</details>

主持人说，我完全听过同样的话，但很高兴您最终“看到了光明”。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well I'll tell you I'll tell you s I've heard I've heard exactly the same thing um but I'm I'm I'm I'm really glad you saw the light.</p>
</details>

### 金融危机与教育的“二西格玛问题”

主持人问，您是什么时候意识到这会变得非常重要的？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now when did you realize that this was really going to be big.</p>
</details>

萨尔·汗说，我们都记得，或者很多人都记得2008年和2009年发生了什么，当时发生了金融危机。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we all remember or many of us remember what was happening in um 2008 and 2009 uh you have the financial crisis.</p>
</details>

我当时已经为我的表亲们制作了关于代数、物理和SAT备考的视频。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and I was already making videos from my cousins on algebra and physics and SAT prep.</p>
</details>

然后我发现人们不理解资不抵债和流动性不足的区别，他们不理解什么是信用违约互换（credit default swap）或抵押贷款支持证券（mortgage-backed security）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then I saw that people were not did not understand the difference between um insolvency and illiquidity they did not understand what a credit default swap is or what a mortgage back sec security.</p>
</details>

这些在历史上属于高端金融人士才了解的“异国情调”事物，现在却登上了报纸头条或新闻。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and these things that historically were kind of exotic things that people in High Finance would know we now on the headlines on on in the newspaper or on the news.</p>
</details>

于是我开始制作关于美联储如何运作、金融传染病是什么样子、什么是抵押贷款支持证券、信用违约互换等等的视频。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so I started making videos on how does a Federal Reserve work what does a financial contagion look like um what's a mortgage back security credit default swap etc etc.</p>
</details>

结果，主流媒体开始给我发信，说：“嘿，我们在报道金融危机之前会看你的视频。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and um it turns out that the mainstream press I started getting letters from the the mainstream Outlet saying hey we're watching your videos before we're reporting on the financial crisis.</p>
</details>

可汗学院第一次获得全国乃至国际关注，与学术科目无关，而是美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）邀请我连续15分钟谈论金融危机，那一天市场下跌了大约4%或5%。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then they the first National publicity or International publicity that Khan Academy got had nothing to do with academic subjects it was CNN brought me on to talk about the financial crisis for 15 minutes straight on the day that I think you know the market tanked by like 4% that day or 5% uh.</p>
</details>

这对我来说是一个信号。虽然现在人们在YouTube上做视频、获得大量关注甚至以此谋生已经很普遍，但在2008年、2009年，这并不是主流。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but that was a signal that to me that look though even though what I was you know now it's become mainstream for people to do something on YouTube and to get a lot of attention and even make a living in 2008 2009 that was not a mainstream thing as especially because I wasn't doing dance videos I was doing fairly you know I was explaining credit default swaps um.</p>
</details>

尤其是我不是在做舞蹈视频，我是在解释信用违约互换。但当你因此获得那种关注时，我就觉得：“好吧，这里面有重要的东西。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but that you know when you get that type of attention for it I was like okay there's something here.</p>
</details>

这也有助于为我们在数学、科学以及所有其他科目上所做的工作带来更多关注和口碑。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then that helped bring even more attention and Word of Mouth to what was happening on the math and the science and and all the other subjects we were doing.</p>
</details>

主持人问，您谈到的这种辅导，这种详细的帮助，被称为“二西格玛问题”（Two-Sigma Problem），但也是“二西格玛机会”。您具体指的是什么？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but there's something with this tutoring this uh kind of detail help that you talk about as the two Sigma well two Sigma problem but also to Sigma opportunity what what exactly do you mean by that.</p>
</details>

萨尔·汗解释说，人们总是凭直觉认为，最好的教育来自于大量的关注，如果有一个一对一的导师，甚至是一支导师队伍。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah well I think people have always intuitively thought that hey the best education is going to come if you have a lot of attention if you have a one-on-one tutor or if you even have an army of tutors.</p>
</details>

纵观历史，王子、国王和未来的皇帝所受的教育，他们不是坐在30个学生的教室里，也不是有人只是给他们讲课，然后时不时地考试，如果他们考试不及格，课程就直接进入下一个主题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">you if we think about throughout history what what princes and and kings and and future Emperors got as their education they did not sit in a class of 30 students and someone did not just lecture to them and every now and then they took a test and if they happen to fail the test the class just moves on to the next subject.</p>
</details>

年轻的亚历山大大帝（Alexander the Great），当时他还不是亚历山大大帝，当然他是否“伟大”现在还有争议，但在公元前300多年，他的导师是**亚里士多德**（Aristotle: 古希腊哲学家、科学家，被誉为“百科全书式的学者”）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>

我猜想，如果亚里士多德知道这个孩子有一天会成为皇帝，如果他在军事策略上遇到困难，他不会只给他一个C然后继续前进。

<details>

<p class="english-text">and I am guessing that if you know Aristotle said okay this this kid's going to be Emperor one day if if he's struggling with military strategy I'm not just going to give him a c and move on.</p>

他会和他一起努力，确保他理解军事策略。如果他在国家或帝国的会计方面遇到困难，他需要理解这些，以便将来能够治理。

快进到大约300年前，大规模公共教育这个非常乌托邦式的想法，在一些最早工业化的国家开始出现，比如现在的德国、英国、美国和日本。

他们是第一批提出应该有大规模公共教育的国家，但他们不得不做出妥协。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but they had to make a compromise.</p>

他们说：“我们负担不起给每个人都配一个亚里士多德。我们将使用工业革命的工具，将学生批量分组，以固定的速度推进课程。”

“我们将制定一些标准，创建一些评估，并进行衡量。我们不需要每个人都掌握量子物理或微积分——当时他们还不知道量子物理。我们不需要每个人都能成为教授，所以我们只会对人们进行分类。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and is that pretty much and do you and do you feel that's pretty much how Society still works.</p>

萨尔·汗回答说，是的，这就是我们过去300年来一直习以为常的系统，我们理所当然地认为世界就是这样运作的。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah I mean that's that's that's the system that we've taken for granted that we just assume is how the world works for the last 300 years.</p>

您提到了**二西格玛研究**（Two-Sigma Study: 教育领域的一个概念，指通过一对一辅导和掌握式学习，学生的学习成绩可以提高两个标准差）。本杰明·布鲁姆（Benjamin Bloom）在1984年写了一篇论文，这可能是关于辅导和**掌握式学习**（Mastery Learning: 一种教学方法，要求学生在进入下一个学习阶段之前，必须完全掌握当前阶段的学习内容）被引用最多的论文。

<p class="english-text">and to you know you allude to the two Sigma study Benjamin Bloom this is back in 1984 he wrote this paper it's it's probably the most cited paper on tutoring and Mastery learning.</p>

掌握式学习就是这个想法：如果你还没有学会，就继续努力。这就是掌握式学习的全部。不要继续前进，或者你可以继续前进，但要回来填补空白。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and Mastery learning is just this idea if you haven't learned it yet keep working on it that's all Mastery learning is don't don't move on or you can move on but come back and and and fill in that Gap.</p>
</details>

他在那篇论文中提出，并有一些数据支持，通过在掌握式学习框架下进行一对一辅导，你可以获得两个标准差的提高。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and you know he argues in that paper and he has some data to back it up that you could get a two standard deviation Improvement by having one-on-one two ing in a Mastery framework.</p>
</details>

从那时起，人们一直在争论是两个标准差还是更少，但总的来说，有大量的证据表明，更多的个性化、一对一的教学对学生有益，它确实有效果。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now since then people have debated is it two standard deviations is it less but generally speaking there's there's a large evidence pool that more personalization one-on-one is good for is is good for students it has it has an effect.</p>
</details>

但他将那篇论文框定为一个问题，因为他说：“这很好，但你如何将其规模化？”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but he he framed that paper as a problem because he's like well this is nice but how are you going to scale that.</p>

如果想想可汗学院一直在做的事情，甚至在我们谈论**生成式人工智能**（Generative AI: 一种能够生成文本、图像或其他媒体内容的人工智能）之前，我一直在努力将自己作为一对一导师进行规模化。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well not what if you think about what KH academ has been doing even before we talk about things like generative AI I was trying to scale myself as a one-on-one tutor.</p>

我做的第一件事是创建了一些个性化练习，然后为自己创建了仪表盘来监控我的学生，我的表亲们，这样我就可以更个性化地辅导他们。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and the first thing I did is I created some of those personalized exercises then I created dashboards for myself to monitor my my students my cousins so that I could be more personalized with them when I got on the phone.</p>

我开始制作按需视频，这与一对一辅导不同，但它具有某些方面。如果我的表亲们在深夜遇到困难，他们可以获得这种按需帮助。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">I started write making on demand video it's not the same as a one-on-one tutor but it has aspects of it if my cousins were stuck in the middle of the night they could get that on demand help.</p>

萨尔·汗说，曾经有一个时刻，我们听说了蒙古牧羊人的故事，一个15岁的孩子在麻省理工学院（MIT）入学考试中取得了优异成绩，每个人都觉得全世界的人都能成功。但我们并没有看到那么多蒙古人进入顶尖大学。为什么会这样？

<details>

所以这些故事是存在的。这是一个方面，对于那些有合理动力的人——我指的不是那些高成就者，因为最后一个例子是系统认为不成功的人——但如果他们有动力，并且这种动力可能在人生的不同阶段被激发出来。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so so this is out there so that's one story that for for those who are reasonably motivated and I'm not necessarily High achieving because this last example was someone that the system was telling was was not achieving but if they're motivated and that motivation might kick in at different stages of life.</p>
</details>

如果他们有动力，并且至少能接触到互联网连接、电脑，并知道可汗学院和其他工具（比如**慕课**MOOCs），我们正在看到一场小小的革命，这些原本可能被埋没的人现在有了机会。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>

</details>

然而，无论好坏，我刚刚描述的这群人只占总人口的一小部分。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">now for better for worse that that group of people that I just described is a a small minority of the broader population.</p>

所以我想有两个任务：一是我们如何让这些人所做的事情变得更容易，这样你就不必拥有他们那样的决心才能成功。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so I think there's two tasks one is how do we lower how do we make it even easier and easier to do what these people just did so that you don't have to have quite their determination to to be able to uh pull it off.</p>
</details>

然后，我认为另一个因素是，有很多学习者——我认为他们并非天生缺乏动力，但我认为多年来他们身上发生了一些事情，让他们放弃了。

<p class="english-text">so we were having these debates and we decided look we can't shy away from this let's build this but let's turn all of those fears and risks into features.</p>

所以我们让它对老师透明，让另一个AI监控，如果发现任何异常，它会关闭对话并主动通知老师。

<details>

<p class="english-text">so let's make it so it's transparent to teachers let's make it so that another AI is monitoring if it notices anything going funny it'll shut down the conversation and actively notify uh teachers.</p>
</details>

我们还有各种其他防护措施，它不会作弊，它更像是一个**苏格拉底式导师**（Socratic Tutor: 一种通过提问而非直接给出答案来引导学生思考和学习的教学方式），会用引导性问题推动你前进。

<p class="english-text">I could I could speak for an hour about all the features we're hoping to add in the next in the next year but but it's a lot's happening there.</p>
</details>

主持人建议大家听您的TED演讲，关于AI与教育。但就通用教育系统而言，他们应该如何应用AI呢？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">yeah I would recommend everybody to listen to your Tad talk and uh on on AI and education but um what uh but in terms of the general educational system how should they you go about applying AI or not.</p>
</details>

萨尔·汗说，他们绝对不能忽视它。这将是未来的一项关键技能，几乎在每个岗位上都是如此。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">well I they definitely can't ignore it uh this is going to be a key skill going forward already in almost every role.</p>
</details>

同时，我完全理解教育工作者为什么禁止ChatGPT，因为它不是为教育而设计的，它可能被用来作弊，它没有设置那么多防护措施，甚至不允许18岁以下的用户使用，尽管我相信很多18岁以下的人都说自己18岁并正在使用它。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">at the same time I completely understand where Educators you know why they banned chat GPT because it's not made for Education it it can be used to cheat it is not it did not put as many safeguards it's it's not even allowed for under 18 users although I'm sure a lot of under 18 folks have you know said they're 18 and and and are using it.</p>
</details>

所以重要的是要在具有所有正确教育防护措施的环境中使用这些工具，而不是为了使用工具而使用。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so the important thing is to use these tools in an environment that is one has all the right guard rails for education and you're not using a tool for the sake of it.</p>
</details>

如果我们想节省老师在批改作业、备课等方面的时间，他们就应该使用像Khanmigo这样的工具。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">if we want to save teachers time on grading on lesson planning Etc they should be using tool like like kigo.</p>
</details>

所以，这实际上是关于拥抱底层技术，但以一种深思熟虑且专为教育目的而设计的方式使用它。

<details>

### 萨尔·汗的教育愿景与AI对不平等的影响

主持人问，如果您现在有10亿美元，您会如何花这笔钱来改善教育？

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">if you got $1 billion dollar now how would you spend it to improve education.</p>
</details>

萨尔·汗说，如果我有10亿美元，这是一个有趣的问题。我会加速。我会加速发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">if I had a billion dollars it's a fun question um I would I would accelerate I would accelerate the you.</p>
</details>

现在可汗学院的预算大约是7500万美元，明年可能会达到8000万美元。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">know right now Khan Academy's budget is around 75 it's probably going to be about $80 million next year uh.</p>
</details>

每次我提到这个数字，因为我必须通过慈善筹集大部分资金，我都会告诉捐助者：“嘿，这只是美国一所大型高中的预算，而我们正在教育和触及很多人。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and every time I say that because I have to raise a lot of that money philanthropically I remind my I I tell donors hey that's just the budget of a large High School in the US and you know we're we're educating a lot of folks and reaching a lot of folks.</p>
</details>

但我可能会每年再投入3000万到4000万美元，进一步加速我们正在进行的许多内容、软件和产品开发。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but I I would probably take another 30 to 40 million a year and further accelerate a lot of the content and software and and product development we're doing.</p>
</details>

我们的目标一直是在AI出现之前就覆盖所有核心学术科目和年级。我们已经很接近了，但我会继续推进，从学前班到大学核心课程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">our goal has always been even before AI to cover all of the core academic subjects and grades we're close already but I would go and that's from prek through the core of college.</p>
</details>

所以我会用一部分资金加速进入更多的学科领域。我们已经有了数学，而且相当全面，我会进一步深入大学科学课程。我们已经非常全面了，我会进一步深入到大二、大三的大学课程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so I would use some of that to accelerate into even more uh subject areas we we already have math we already have pretty comprehensive I would go even further into college science we're quite comprehensive I'd go even further into sophomore junior level College.</p>
</details>

我们正在开始提供相当强大的**人文**和**英语语言艺术**课程，我也会尝试加速这方面的发展。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">we're starting to have a pretty robust humanities and um English language arts offering I would try to accelerate that.</p>
</details>

然后，在AI方面，我会利用这些资源来进一步加速。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then on the AI front um yeah I would I would use a lot of those resources to just accelerate it that much more.</p>
</details>

但有了这类资源，我还可能会创建国家或国际的**认证系统**（Credentialing Systems），通过这些系统，你可以通过自己的学习或支持来掌握很多知识，并且可以证明你确实掌握了。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but you know with that type of resources I would also probably create National or International systems around credentialing uh where you know the tools exist now where you can learn a lot on your own or with support and those tools and then you can even prove that you know it.</p>
</details>

但传统的系统尚未完全认可这一点。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but the the the Legacy systems don't fully recognize it yet yet.</p>
</details>

所以我告诉人们，如果我是一个国家的教育部长，我做的第一件事就是创建一套**能力导向评估**（Competency-Based Assessments: 一种衡量学生是否掌握特定技能和知识的评估方式，而非基于学时或课程完成情况）。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and so you know I've told people if I was Secretary of Education or minister of education for any country the first thing I would do is create a competency based set of Assessments that if anyone did it these count as good or better than any University any High School any graduate program.</p>
</details>

如果任何人通过了这些评估，它们的效力将等同于或优于任何大学、高中或研究生课程。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and then you allow the world to create resources organizations like Khan Academy to create resources to prepare people for those.</p>
</details>

然后，你允许世界各地创建资源，像可汗学院这样的组织可以创建资源来帮助人们准备这些评估。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">some people could use the KH like if you think about this young Afghani girl some people like her could use the the KH Academy resources alone to prepare and then take these assessments and then they have a degree that's better than any degree.</p>
</details>

有些人，比如那位年轻的阿富汗女孩，可以单独使用可汗学院的资源进行准备，然后参加这些评估，这样他们就能获得一个比任何学位都更好的学位。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">but if a lot of students would need more supports well then that's where the traditional school system could use Khan Academy plus all of the inhuman the the the main not inhuman the in-person supports uh to to actually support these students more.</p>
</details>

但如果很多学生需要更多支持，那么传统的学校系统就可以利用可汗学院加上所有面对面的支持，来更好地支持这些学生。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">so that's where I would put a lot of resources I still don't think that would get us fully to a billion dollars but you know then you know maybe I I I would create a new type of University U that is much lower cost and much more Hands-On and you know gives exposure to more kids.</p>
</details>

所以我会把大量资源投入到那里。我仍然不认为这会完全花掉10亿美元，但你知道，也许我会创建一种新型大学，成本更低，更注重实践，并让更多的孩子接触到这些。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">the credentials element you talked about is anybody working on creating such a thing.</p>
</details>

</details>

萨尔·汗说，有一些小规模的徽章认证之类的项目，但我认为还没有人从“我们不想让这仅仅是你上了一门慕课课程就获得一个徽章，然后从普通计算机科学家变成数据科学家”的角度来解决这个问题。

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>
<p class="english-text">and that's great that that exists that that pathway but we don't have a pathway right now that says hey this is just as good as Harvard um if you do this you know right now in the US there's all of these debates about you know you have limited seats at these top universities um.</p>
</details>

那种途径已经存在，而且很好。但我们现在还没有一条途径能说：“嘿，这和哈佛大学一样好。”

<details>
<summary>View/Hide Original English</summary>

</details>

如果你们能把成本降下来，使其几乎免费——就像实际成本几乎免费，不需要大量的政府补贴——并且让任何有能力完成学业的学生都能完成学业，那么任何想学习的人，无论年龄大小，都能做到。

<p class="english-text">are there ways that we could do this different so that we we can get more scale and leverage and you know one of the things I found a lot of times people think about the size of an organization and it is true the main cost in organizations these days is salaries but the one of the reasons to keep an organization is small small as possible isn't necessarily like cost savings it's actually communication and being able to be nimble.</p>
</details>

有没有其他方式可以做到这一点，以便我们能够获得更大的规模和影响力？你知道，我发现很多时候人们会考虑组织的规模，确实，现在组织的主要成本是工资，但保持组织尽可能小的原因不一定是为了节省成本，实际上是为了沟通和保持敏捷。

<p class="english-text">if Khan Academy last year was a 20,000 person organization I don't think there was any way that I would have been able to make this move into AI that we did even with 250 people it it wasn't easy it's still you know we're not a we're not a speedboat we're kind of a yeah I don't know like a catamaran maybe like you know but we're not a cruise ship either and that cruise ship was very hard to change turn around when you realize that there's an iceberg if you don't if you if you don't turn around um.</p>
</details>

如果可汗学院去年是一个2万人的组织，我不认为我们能够像现在这样进军人工智能领域，即使有250人，这也不容易。我们仍然不是一艘快艇，我们更像是一艘双体船吧，但我们也不是一艘游轮。当意识到有冰山时，游轮很难掉头。

<p class="english-text">so so I think in in you know going forward that's going to be even more important than than you know it's not about saving money and obviously we are limited by resources because we're we we raise primarily through philanthropy but it's more about being able to stay Nimble.</p>
</details>

所以，我认为在未来，这会比以往任何时候都更重要。这不仅仅是为了省钱，显然我们受到资源的限制，因为我们主要通过慈善募捐，但更重要的是能够保持敏捷。

<p class="english-text">oh if I were to do another degree that's a good question um part of me you know when I went into college I I thought I wanted to be a theoretical physicist CU I just wanted to understand the nature of reality um.</p>
</details>

萨尔·汗说，哦，如果我再攻读一个学位，这是个好问题。我有一部分，你知道，当我上大学时，我以为我想成为一名理论物理学家，因为我只是想了解现实的本质。

<p class="english-text">now I've kind of reached the conclusion I should just meditate my way there but theoretical physics is still is is still um an area that I you know my my oldest son is kind of almost caught up with me in terms of uh his math and science and I said okay when you catch up with me we're going to start studying quantum physics together so that so that so that I can I can you know uh uh I I want to understand the frontiers of of of of reality of of how we how we understand reality.</p>
</details>

现在我有点得出结论，我应该通过冥想达到那里，但理论物理仍然是我感兴趣的领域。我的大儿子在数学和科学方面几乎赶上了我，我说：“好吧，等你赶上我，我们就要一起学习量子物理了。”这样我就可以，你知道，我想了解现实的边界，了解我们如何理解现实。

<p class="english-text">now you know I saying that I was the guy who just said I went to business school not knowing what to do I used that as a reason to figure out and I think there are some degree programs like mbas that are are good for just kind of figuring out what you want to do but I knew I wanted to do something in Industry uh at least I thought I did.</p>
</details>

现在你知道，我说这话的时候，我就是那个说自己去商学院时不知道要做什么的人。我把它当作一个弄清楚自己方向的理由，我认为有些学位课程，比如工商管理硕士（MBA），很适合用来弄清楚你想做什么。但我知道我想在工业界做些事情，至少我当时是这么认为的。

<p class="english-text">it's funny the only class I HB Harvard doesn't fail you anyone in the business school but they tell you internally that you would have failed if the only class that I was very cynical about that I kind of got the equivalent of a failing grade was called uh social entrepreneurship and and it was and and it was because I was such a cynic in that class.</p>
</details>

有趣的是，我在哈佛商学院唯一一门我非常愤世嫉俗，并且相当于得了不及格的课程，叫做“社会创业”。那是因为我在那门课上非常愤世嫉俗。

</details>

你知道，我们研究的很多案例都是关于有人组织自行车骑行来治疗某种疾病，我记得在课堂上发言说：“那不会治愈疾病，那只是一次自行车骑行，它怎么能治愈疾病呢？而且大部分钱都会用于资助骑行周围的所有盛大场面。”我后来才意识到那位教授组织了那个慈善活动，所以那不太好。

但是，我现在已经转变了看法，我看到了这类事情的重要性，因为它们能为一项努力带来关注。但讽刺的是，我上了商学院，社会创业这门课不及格，而这正是我现在所做的事情。

</details>

萨尔·汗说，哦，你知道，我大部分时间都在硬科幻小说和维多利亚时代经典之间切换。我刚读了《远大前程》（Great Expectations）。我第一次读它是在七年级，当时是被迫读的，我非常讨厌。他们不应该让七年级学生读那本书，尤其是七年级男生，除非他们真的想读，否则不应该强迫任何人读。

<p class="english-text">because you don't appreciate it I read it just now I'm like this is the most amazing book there's like so much wisdom and wit it's hilarious and it's modern in so many ways.</p>

因为你不会欣赏它。我最近读了它，心想：“这是最棒的书，充满了智慧和机智，非常搞笑，而且在很多方面都很现代。”

</details>

所以，你知道，我会在重读那些我上学时被迫阅读的伟大经典之间切换，现在我能够正确地阅读它们，所以我喜欢这样做。然后，你知道，我还读了很多硬科幻小说，我一直是阿西莫夫（Isaac Asimov）和阿瑟·C·克拉克（Arthur C. Clarke）的粉丝，现在我正在确保阅读他们所有的书。你知道，我读过他们最著名的书，但现在我正在读他们所有的作品。

</details>

萨尔·汗说，你知道，我们每天都会收到几十封信，人们说：“我以为我数学很差，我只是每周花30到40分钟来保持大脑活跃，然后我发现我爱上了它。”他们中的很多人都很生气，因为他们现在已经30或40岁了，他们说：“我希望在我12岁的时候有人能以这种方式向我展示这些。”

所以我只想说，开始学习吧，不一定非要通过可汗学院，当然可汗学院就在那里。但只是阅读、探索，你知道，很多这些人工智能工具都非常引人入胜，可以与Khanmigo进行对话，你可以进行苏格拉底式对话，你可以参与辩论。我个人非常喜欢，当我有时间深入研究一个我渴望进行的辩论，但又找不到人与我辩论时。

主持人总结说，萨尔，能与您对话真是太棒了。我不得不说，我想不出还有谁为全世界的学习做出了更多贡献。所以，非常感谢您，也代表所有人感谢您。您肯定已经通过了那门社会创业课程，所以恭喜您，这是一堂真实的课程，非常棒，也许是基于掌握式学习的。非常感谢，请继续努力，期待保持联系。萨尔·汗回应道，太棒了，谢谢邀请。
