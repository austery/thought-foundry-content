### 文化中的问候与连接的力量

在我国家的文化中，走进一间屋子的第一件事并不是简单地打个招呼。**“Sanibona”** 是我们彼此问候的方式，而你需要以 **“Sakubona”** 回应。这不是一个简单的礼貌形式，而是一种深层的文化仪式。

“Sanibona”的含义是：“我们看见你”。这不意味着只是看到一个人，而是在那一刻，我所携带的一切——我的身份、历史与传承——都在看见你背后的故事。这同时也意味着祖先们也正通过我来看见你。

接下来的互动更加重要，但我保证这不会是最后一件事。我要你们重复一句话，**这是必须的仪式**，它叫做：“Amakhankatha”（笑声）。是的，在我的语言 **IsiXhosa** 中，这是一句相当难念顺口的句子。而它的困难程度也恰恰反映了语言背后的文化深度。

也许你会想当然地认为，我来到这里是为了分享一些“新发现”或“颠覆性的见解”。但事实是，我只是想纯粹地讲故事。**我并不希望你们从这些故事中学习任何东西**。

我的第一个故事发生在很久以前，当我刚开始从事广告业的时候。我的表舅 Xolisa 正在拍摄一个广告，并且与传奇人物 **William Shatner** 合作。我作为一名忠实的《波士顿法律》粉丝，非常激动地得知 Shatner 要来南非。他被我们的热情感动，在离开前专门安排了与我们共进午餐。

那是一个我从未去过的昂贵、豪华的酒店。Shatner 先请来服务员，点了三杯最贵的威士忌，并问我们：“如果金钱不是问题，你会选择什么类型的雪茄？”那一刻，我完全被震撼了。他不仅倾听我们每个人的想法，还用整个身体表达对我们的关注——这让我第一次感受到什么是真正的“被看见”。

我们谈了两个小时多，从家庭到宗教、从哲学到人生。他不是一位遥不可及的明星，而更像是我失散多年的祖父。

但当我们要离开时，他却对服务员说：“他们来付账。”（笑声）那一刻的温暖与尊重，至今让我难以忘怀。

So it is quite traditional in my country to walk into a room and to greet. But not just to greet. You're supposed to respond back to the greeting that I'm about to teach you. I promise you, it's very easy. So there are two things that I'm going to ask of you today, because I imagine some of you are maybe pretty shy, OK? So what I will say is: “Sanibona.” And you will respond back by saying, “Sakubona.” Alright, are you ready? Sanibona! Audience: Sakubona. KD: Thank you, that was very easy, right? Very easy. So in my culture, it is considered considerably rude to walk into a room without any greeting, as I mentioned to you before. What sanibona really means is: “We see you.” It's kind of crazy to think that I'm saying that we see you, right, but it's just one person, it's just me standing here. What it really means is that everything that I am, everything that I come with, sees all the stories that come with you. It also means that the ancestors come with me and they, too, see you. That’s what sanibona truly, truly means. This is the second thing I'm going to ask you to do today. I promise you, it's the last thing I'm going to ask you. And it’s even easier than sakubona, alright? So I'm going to ask you to repeat after me. It is a tradition, you have to say this after you say sakubona. Are you ready? Alright. (Speaking in IsiXhosa) (Laughter) (Continues in IsiXhosa) Your turn. (Laughter) Alright, that is a notoriously difficult tongue twister in my language of IsiXhosa. IsiXhosa, I'm pretty sure even that is pretty difficult to say, the language itself. So this is a language that I speak. And I'm pretty sure you're saying, OK, great, Khaya, what are you here to tell us? What is the great new insight that you're going to reveal to us today, besides doing some breakdancing with your tongue? To tell you the truth, is that I'm literally just here to have conversation for the sake of conversation. I'm here to tell stories for the sake of telling stories.

### 文化差异中的“看见”与联结

我的第二个故事发生在种族隔离制度结束的南非。那时候，我是一个第一批被允许进入白人政府学校读书的孩子——而我是班上唯一一个黑人学生。

我记得有一次，我和一群新结识的朋友去图书馆。他们对天文学有着浓厚的兴趣（就像很多小男孩一样），而我们正认真地研究太阳系的结构。一个孩子指着月亮说：“你看到那个男人了吗？”我却看到了一个女人——背着婴儿、头上扛着水桶的妇女。这是我在乡村生活了第一个十年所熟悉的图像。

我们看到了不同的版本，但我们都相信对方的故事是真实的。这种文化的交汇——虽然完全不同——却让我们建立起一种信任和尊重。

如果我们只坚持自己的视角是“唯一正确”的，那么我们永远无法建立真正连接的桥梁。**我们要做的不是让一个故事取代另一个，而是拥抱所有版本的故事。**

So my second story that I'm about to tell you is that I grew up towards the tail end of apartheid South Africa. And what that meant was that I was in the first cohort of kids, of Black kids, who were allowed to go to previously white-only government schools. In fact, I was the only Black child in my class when I went to this particular school. And I have this very vivid memory of me in junior school, going to the library with my new white friends. And we get into the library, and this profound obsession with these other boys of astronomy, as young boys tend to do. And we went to the library and spoke in hushed tones, and were paging through and showing off what we know about the planetary systems. And this one boy says to me, when I saw a picture of this moon, he said, "Oh, when you look at the moon, you can see the face of a man on the moon." And I remember being quite flabbergasted and thinking, "There is no man on the moon. What do you mean?" And then he began to trace out these images of what you could see. And I saw a man on the moon for the first time. You see, the very difference between him and I is that I’d spent the first 10 years of my life in village South Africa. And now, when I say village, don't imagine the idealistic village in England. This is the kind of village that I'm talking about. It is the actual village where I spent the first 10 years of my life. So do you know what I saw when I was looking at images, when I looked at the moon? I could see a woman carrying a bucket on her head with a baby on her back. I'm sure you're confused, saying, what is this? This is what we saw. This is what we grew up seeing. We saw a woman, and not a man. A woman carrying a bucket on her head with a baby on her back. That's what I'd always known.

### 技术时代的孤独：我们正在失去“纯粹的连接”

今天，我想问一个问题：**我们什么时候开始把每一次对话都当作一种“交易”？**

我们总是试图给每一场交流贴上 KPI 的标签，却忘记了对话最本真的意义——**就是与另一个生命共享时光的体验。**

但问题是，现代科技正在取代我们之间最原始的那种“看见”。我们在手机上与人聊天的时间越多，反而越不了解身边的人。我们甚至可以说，在这个时代中，**“认识你手中的技术”，已经超过了“认识你的邻居”。**

这并不是一个夸张的说法。我的弟弟曾因为沉迷于在线体育赌博而选择自杀，他无法与家人沟通，也无法寻求帮助。我的母亲在得知真相后，曾预言自己“会在一年内死去”。她确实没有死——那年之后的几年里都很健康。但就在大约一年前，她因无法与儿子建立连接而去世了。

And then, I'm sure another question that you're wondering is like, "Khaya, OK, we hear you, did you really mean it when you said that you're telling stories for the sake of telling stories?" Yes, I meant it. And I said that I don't want you to learn anything from these lessons, but I do have a question. And one of the questions that I have to ask is: When did we decide that every conversation must be transactional? When did we decide that every conversation must have some hidden KPI, and not have a conversation for its sake, to enjoy the company of another human? Because in reality, what we do know is that behind every casual conversation we'll have with anybody is the desire for connection. We want to connect with another human being.

### AI无法取代：人类“纯粹连接”的能力

AI 可以做几乎所有的事——从算法到讲故事，但从一个心去感受另一个心的故事，这是 AI 做不到的。

**真正让我们成为人类的，并不是我们有多聪明、多高效，而是我们能否仅仅为了联结而连接。**

AI 可以模仿人类的语言、逻辑甚至情感，但它无法复刻那种从灵魂深处延伸出的“看见”。AI 可以生成故事，但它无法讲述一个心与另一个心之间那种深刻共鸣的故事。

而这就是我们应该坚持的——**不要让技术夺走我们作为人类最根本的能力：纯粹地去连接。**

AI is going to take over all sorts of tasks. And correctly so. It's going to take over tasks, it's going to take over all sorts of algorithms. But the one thing it cannot do is take our humanity. It cannot do that. While AI can tell all stories and can tell beautiful stories, it cannot tell a story that one heart can tell to another. While human beings are made for connecting with one another, while sharing stories for the sake of sharing stories, while having conversations for the sake of conversation is not what makes us human. What really makes us human is the fact that we simply connect for the sake of connecting.
